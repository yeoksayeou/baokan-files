Guangdong's Sea Fertilizer Resources Are Abundant

　　This newspaper reports that coastal areas of Guangdong Province are actively developing sea fertilizer. The Foshan, Zhanjiang, Huiyang, and Shantou regions, as well as Hainan Island, have established specialized agencies to conduct detailed investigations and guide farmers in collecting fertilizer from the sea. Currently, over 3,000 wooden boats from various coastal counties are going out to sea daily to collect fertilizer. In the past half-month, these areas have collected over 1.23 billion catties of sea fertilizer. It is expected that the sea fertilizer developed throughout the province this year will meet the needs of 4 million mu of paddy fields.

　　Guangdong Province has very rich reserves of sea fertilizer. In the more than thirty coastal counties with thousands of kilometers of coastline, inexhaustible sea fertilizer can be collected year-round. Dianbai County alone can collect over 100 million dan of sea fertilizer annually. Last year, after 330 agricultural cooperatives in Yangjiang, Dianbai, Wuchuan, Wanning, Rao Ping, and other counties used sea fertilizer, the yield of ordinary paddy fields generally increased by 20 to 50 catties per mu. In 1953, the average yield of rice in the 2,470 mu of fields in Beiji Township, Yangjiang County, was only about 400 catties per mu. After applying sea fertilizer, the average yield per mu jumped to over 700 catties last year, and production costs were generally reduced by 40% to 50%. (Li Shaoqiu)

Shandong Grasps Two Major Fertilizer Sources

　　Jinan, February 7th. This newspaper reports: The fertilizer accumulation campaign in Shandong Province has two main characteristics: one is to firmly grasp the central link of raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer. With the rapid increase in pigs, more fertilizer is accumulated. The province currently has over 8 million pigs, an increase of more than 20% since before winter, and has accumulated over 300 billion catties of fertilizer. In addition to topdressing for wheat fields, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of spring fields can reach over 4,000 catties, an increase of 62.9% over previous years. Another feature is the combination of the fertilizer accumulation campaign with the patriotic health campaign, which has extensively opened up fertilizer sources, especially since the province promoted Shou Zhang County's method of using high-temperature fermentation to produce artificial fertilizer, which has yielded great results.

　　The current problems in Shandong Province's fertilizer accumulation campaign are: some places focus on water conservancy and relax their leadership in fertilizer accumulation; some have fertilizer application plans but no fertilizer accumulation plans; some only shout slogans that fertilizer accumulation is key to increasing production, but do not supervise and inspect fertilizer accumulation actions. There are even phenomena of only paying attention to quantity and not quality.

Huaihua Launches "On-Site Fertilizer Accumulation"

　　This newspaper reports, according to the New Hunan Daily, that Huaihua County, Hunan Province, is promoting the advanced experience of Baiyanping Cooperative in transforming low-yield fields through "on-site fertilizer accumulation."

　　Baiyanping Cooperative is located in a mountainous area with scattered land. Out of the cooperative's 1,100 mu of paddy fields, more than 300 mu are distributed in 23 deep mountain valleys about ten miles away from the villagers' residences. Due to inconvenient cultivation and low fertilizer application over the years, coupled with poor soil quality and sunlight, yields have been consistently low. In November of last year, when formulating the 1958 production plan, the cooperative proposed a plan to move people and cattle to the mountains to accumulate fertilizer on-site and transform low-yield fields. After discussion, the cooperative immediately organized three temporary mountain production teams, totaling 30 laborers and 12 draft cattle, to accumulate fertilizer on-site. In the 45 days after going to the mountains, the three temporary mountain production teams accumulated more than 24,000 dan of fertilizer, increasing the fertilizer application per mu from more than 20 dan last year to more than 250 dan now. It is estimated that the yield of these low-yield fields can be increased from 200 catties last year to 350 catties this year. In addition, on-site fertilizer accumulation can save a lot of labor. Taking manure delivery as an example, the cooperative can save more than 43,000 workdays.

　　The Huaihua County Party Committee attaches great importance to Baiyanping Cooperative's experience in "on-site fertilizer accumulation" and decided to vigorously promote it throughout the county, striving to transform all of the county's more than 40,000 mu of low-yield fields this year. Currently, 13 townships and 28 cooperatives in Huaihua County have promoted Baiyanping Cooperative's experience, organizing more than 800 people and 250 draft cattle to go to the mountains, accumulating more than 410,000 dan of fertilizer and improving more than 1,500 mu of low-yield fields.

Heyang Achieves "Six Transformations"

　　This newspaper reports that Heyang County, Shaanxi Province, is a sparsely populated area with few livestock and a shortage of fertilizer. Although the fertilizer application area in 1957 increased by 11% compared to before the cooperativization, more than 30% of the cultivated land area was still unfertilized. In order to completely reverse the fertilizer shortage, after county leaders personally went deep into several cooperatives to understand the situation, they decided in November 1957, simultaneously with the farmland water conservancy construction campaign, to mobilize 100,000 laborers to carry out a fertilizer accumulation and search campaign centered on six transformations. The slogan is: Realize six transformations, search and accumulate 3.5 million carts of various miscellaneous fertilizers. The six transformations are: change above-ground toilets to pit-style, every household has a urine jar, every team has a public toilet; change ash-padded latrines to single accumulation of straw ash, every team sets up an ash storage; change raising pigs and sheep without pens to having pens; change chickens and ducks without nests to having nests, no longer scattering chicken and duck manure; change emphasizing accumulation and neglecting preservation to emphasizing both accumulation and preservation; improve fertilizer application methods. The objects of fertilizer search are: one sweep (sweep fallen leaves), two finds (wild manure, animal bones), three exchanges (exchange kang, exchange walls, exchange stoves), six digs (bottom of manure piles, bottom of pens, bottom of toilets, bottom of temples, bottom of cellars and ponds), seven shovels (embankment soil, road soil, wasteland courtyard soil, broken residual soil, mausoleum soil, roof soil, forest humus soil).

　　Due to the personal efforts of county and township cadres, leading the broad masses to universally and deeply carry out the fertilizer accumulation campaign, the six transformations have been basically realized, and Heyang's fertilizer situation has taken on a new look. It is estimated that regular fixed fertilizer accumulation can be increased to more than 2.8 million carts; plus the existing fertilizer search, not counting the 1958 surprise fertilizer search and composting, it can reach more than 5.9 million carts. According to the average cultivated land area of the county, more than four carts of fertilizer can be applied per mu.

Strive to Apply 200 Dan of Fertilizer per Mu

　　Guangzhou, This newspaper special dispatch from Xinhua News Agency: As of January 26, Shantou Region, Guangdong Province, has accumulated more than 800 million dan of various fertilizers, exceeding the original plan of accumulating 630 million dan of fertilizer (100 dan of fertilizer per mu). At present, with the majestic spirit of "exceeding the quota again and again, leaping forward again and again," they have increased the fertilizer accumulation task to 1.3 billion dan, striving to apply 200 dan of fertilizer per mu of dry and paddy fields before spring plowing.

　　According to investigations, in addition to the fact that 40%-50% of the ponds and ditches in the plain areas of Shantou Region have not been drained to dig fertilizer, most of the green manure in the mountainous areas has not been collected. Therefore, it is entirely possible for the region to complete the task of accumulating 1.3 billion dan of fertilizer before spring plowing.

Exceed the Fertilizer Application Level of Well-to-Do Middle Peasants

　　This newspaper reports that farmers in various parts of Jiangsu are carrying out fertilizer accumulation and topdressing campaigns with creative enthusiasm. Twenty-five counties and cities across the province have realized the provincial party committee's call to catch up with or exceed the fertilizer application level of well-to-do middle peasants this year.

　　According to reports from various cities and counties on January 19: The province has accumulated 7.1 billion dan of farm fertilizer, built more than 1.5 million new toilets and pigpens, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated has exceeded more than three times the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956 before and after the high tide of cooperativization. Calculated on the basis of the general level of 100 dan of farm fertilizer applied per mu by well-to-do middle peasants in the province, 25 counties and cities in the province have reached or exceeded this level. Among them, Jiangpu and Haimen counties have accumulated an average of 206 dan of fertilizer per mu, and nine counties including Rudong, Sheyang, and Jingjiang have accumulated more than 150 dan of fertilizer per mu.

　　跃进再跃进　肥源挖不尽
    广东海肥蕴藏丰富
    本报讯　广东省沿海地区正在积极开发海肥。佛山、湛江、惠阳、汕头专区和海南岛等地，已经成立专门机构，进行了详细调查和领导农民出海积肥。现在沿海各县每天都有三千多只木船出海打捞肥料，半个月来，各地已采得海肥十二亿三千多万斤，全省在今年开发的海肥将可解决四百万亩稻田的需要。
    广东省海肥的蕴藏量非常丰富，濒海的三十多个县，长达数千公里的海岸线中，一年四季都有取之不尽的海肥，单是电白县每年就可采海肥一亿担以上。去年阳江、电白、吴川、万宁、饶平等县三百三十多个农业社采用海肥后，一般稻田每亩都增产二十至五十斤谷。阳江县北极乡二千四百七十亩田在1953年时平均每亩只产稻谷四百斤左右，经过施用海肥后到去年平均亩产量跃到七百多斤，而且生产成本也普遍降低四、五成。（李少球）
    山东抓住两个主要肥源
    本报济南7日电：山东省积肥运动中有两个主要特点：一个是紧紧抓住了养猪积肥这个中心环节，猪增加得快，肥也积得多。全省存养生猪已达八百多万头，比冬季前增加20％以上，积肥三千多亿斤，除麦田追肥外，每亩春田施肥量可达四千多斤，比往年增长62.9％。另一特点是积肥运动与爱国卫生运动相结合，广泛地开辟了肥源，特别是在全省推广了寿张县的用高热发酵沤制人造肥以来，收效很大。
    当前山东省积肥运动中存在的问题是：有的地方抓住水利放松对积肥的领导。有的有施肥计划却无积肥计划；有的只空喊积肥是增产关键；对积肥行动却没督促检查。甚至还有只注意数量不管质量的现象。
    怀化开展“坐山积肥”
    本报讯　据新湖南报报道，湖南省怀化县正在推广白岩坪社“坐山积肥”改造低产田的先进经验。
    白岩坪社地处山区，土地分散，全社一千一百多亩稻田，就有三百多亩分布在离社员居住地十里左右的二十三个深山峡谷里，由于耕作不便，历年施肥量少，加上土质阳光不好，产量一直很低。去年11月，这个社在制订1958年生产规划时，提出了把人、牛搬上山去，就地积肥，改造低产田的计划。经过讨论，社里立即组织三个临时上山生产队，共三十个劳动力，十二头耕牛去坐山积肥。在上山以后的四十五天内，三个临时上山生产队共积肥二万四千多担，使每亩田从去年施肥二十多担，提高到现在的每亩二百五十多担，据估计，这些低产田的产量今年就可以由去年的二百斤提高到三百五十斤。此外，坐山积肥还能节省大量的劳动力，单以送粪来说，该社就可以省工四万三千多个。
    中共怀化县委很重视白岩坪社“坐山积肥”的经验，决定在全县大力推广，争取在今年内，把全县四万多亩低产田全部改造过来。现在，怀化县已有十三个乡二十八个社推广了白岩坪社的经验，共组织了八百多人，二百五十多头耕牛上山，已经积肥四十一万多担，改良了低产田一千五百多亩。
    郃阳实现“六改”
    本报讯　陕西省郃阳县是个地广人稀牲口少的地方，肥料比较缺乏。1957年施肥面积虽比合作化前增长了11％，但还有30％多的耕地面积未施肥。为了彻底扭转缺肥局面，县领导亲自深入了几个社了解情况后，决定于1957年11月份，与兴修农田水利运动同时，动员十万劳力，开展一个以六改为中心的积肥搜肥运动。口号是：实现六改化，搜积各种杂肥三百五十万车。六改是：改地面厕所为坑式，家家有尿缸，队队有公共厕所；改灰垫茅坑为草木灰单积，队队设灰仓；改猪羊无圈为有圈；改鸡鸭无窝为有窝，不再抛撒鸡鸭粪；改重积轻保为积保并重；改进施肥方法。搜肥对象是一扫（扫落叶），二找（野粪、兽骨）、三换（换炕、换墙、换灶台）、六挖（粪堆底、圈底、厕所底、庙底、窖底涝池底），七铲（埝土、路土、荒院基土、破残土、陵土、房上土、树林腐植土）。
    由于县乡干部亲自动手，带领广大群众普遍深入地开展了积肥运动，六改化已基本实现，郃阳的肥料状况出现了一个新面貌。据估算经常固定性积肥可以增加到二百八十多万车；加上现有搜肥，暂不计算1958年突击搜肥和沤肥数，即可达五百九十多万车。按全县耕地面积平均，每亩可施肥四车多。

　　争取每亩施肥二百担
    本报特约新华社广州电　广东省汕头专区到1月26日止，已积各种肥料八亿多担，超额完成了原订积肥六亿三千万担（每亩积肥一百担）的计划。目前他们又以“超额再超额，跃进再跃进”的雄伟气魄，把积肥任务增加到十三亿担，争取春耕前给每亩水旱田积肥二百担。
    据调查，汕头专区除了平原地区还有40％—50％的池塘和水沟未车干挖肥外，山区也有大部分绿肥未采。因此全区在春耕前，完成积肥十三亿担的任务是完全有可能的。
　　超过富裕中农施肥水平
    本报讯　江苏各地农民正以创造性干劲，开展积肥和追肥运动。全省已有二十五个县市，实现了省委提出的今年赶上或超过富裕中农的施肥水平的号召。
    据各市县1月19日的汇报：全省已积农家肥料七十一亿担，新建厕所、猪圈一百五十多万个，所积肥料已超过了合作化高潮前后的1955年冬—1956年春季积肥数量的三倍以上。如以本省一般富裕中农每亩施用农家肥一百担的水平计算，全省已有二十五个县市，达到或超过了这个水平。其中江浦、海门两县平均每亩已积肥二百零六担，如东、射阳、靖江等九县每亩已积肥一百五十担以上。
