Promoting Economic and Cultural Cooperation Between Asian and African Countries
　　Chu Tunan
    The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was the largest non-governmental international conference in Asian-African history. The conference was extremely representative in terms of both the countries attending and the composition of the delegates. The conference's content was very broad and rich, covering all aspects of concern to the people of Asia and Africa. After heated and harmonious discussions, unanimous resolutions were adopted. These resolutions expressed the common demands of the Asian and African people to oppose imperialism and colonialism, to strive for and safeguard national independence, freedom, equality, and peace, to defend world peace, and to build a prosperous and happy life. On the basis of these common demands, the Asian and African people achieved unprecedented unity. This is the development of the great Bandung spirit and a victory for the forces of world peace.
    The Asian and African people are determined to oppose imperialism and colonialism, to strive for and safeguard national independence, to defend world peace, and to demand the construction of their own prosperous and happy lives from both economic and cultural perspectives. The close unity and cooperation of the Asian and African people is not only essential for the great struggle to win and consolidate national independence, but also extremely important for the economic and cultural construction of Asian and African countries. Due to the long-term enslavement, exploitation, and destruction by colonialism, many Asian and African countries are still in a state of economic poverty and backward modern culture. This determines that after countries gain national independence and a peaceful environment, it is necessary to implement mutual assistance and cooperation and take certain positive collective measures in order to develop the economy, revive national culture, and build a new culture. The speeches and discussions at this Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference fully reflected the demands of the people of Asian and African countries in this regard. The conference also passed resolutions on economic and cultural affairs, putting forward positive suggestions and concrete measures. This will also play a good role in promoting the development of economic and cultural exchanges between countries.
    The preamble to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference's resolution on economic issues points out that the people of Asia and Africa live in 59% of the world's area, this region is rich in minerals and agricultural products, has a large labor force, and a population of about 70% of the world's total. However, due to imperialist aggression and enslavement, many countries have lost their independence, their economies are backward, their living standards are low, unemployment is widespread, and people do not have sufficient educational opportunities. Today, although many countries have gained independence, their economies are still controlled by brutal imperialists, and they are still the targets of aggression and exploitation by imperialist monopoly capitalists. One hundred and fifty million people in Asia and Africa are still suffering from imperialist torment, and their resources are still being plundered. The Asian and African people realize that in their current great movement to strive for and safeguard national independence, they must cooperate closely not only in the political field but also in the economic field, because if they do not develop their economies, their independence cannot be maintained and consolidated, and the material and cultural levels of their societies cannot be improved and raised.
    The preamble to the resolution concludes: "This cooperation and solidarity between different economic categories will consolidate their national independence and promote world peace." This is the unanimous conclusion drawn from the personal experience of the people of all countries.
    The specific recommendations in the above resolution include many important clauses. For example, declaring nationalization as a legitimate means and right possessed by each country is a powerful support for many Asian and African countries in their current fight against colonialism on the economic front. In terms of trade, the resolution emphasizes the need to develop trade between countries without any discrimination or restrictions, and declares that such discrimination and restrictions imposed due to different social and economic systems are unjustified and should therefore be eliminated. Regarding the development of agriculture and industry, the resolution clearly points out that the economic underdevelopment and low living standards of Asian and African countries are largely due to the control of the national economies of Asian and African countries by imperialism. In order to get rid of this imperialist control, the resolution stipulates that foreign investment and loans to Asian and African countries must not be subject to political conditions or be of a nature that restricts or manipulates the economy of the recipient country, nor should it have privileges exceeding national capital. It is worth noting that this provision is particularly meaningful today, when imperialism is attempting to carry out economic aggression in many Asian and African countries with all kinds of new tricks. While resolutely resisting the new conspiracies of imperialism, the Asian and African people are implementing self-reliance and mutual assistance and cooperation in industrial and agricultural construction. Therefore, the conference resolution immediately called on the governments and relevant institutions of Asian and African countries to jointly organize the exchange of economic and technical data and information and the mutual dispatch of experts in various production sectors.
    The conference paid special attention to the economic situation of dependent countries, believing that the liberation of the people of many countries has reduced the world market of colonial countries, so colonial countries are doing everything possible to further exploit the natural resources of dependent countries. The resolution points out: "Those plans called socio-economic development plans of dependent countries will foster a situation in which the industry of a small number of foreign companies is disproportionate to the development of national capital, which is detrimental to the latter." The resolution exposed the essence of the European Common Market of imperialism. It says: "The purpose of the European Common Market is to limit the economic sphere of dependent countries, treat them as the property of six European countries; moreover, it will lead to a large concentration of foreign capital in their territories, thereby further stifling the people's desire to get rid of colonial rule; and finally, it will promote the separation of these dependent countries from independent Asian and African countries." The resolution calls on people to effectively assist the people of dependent countries in their struggle to liberate themselves from colonial oppression.
    It is not difficult to see from the above-mentioned key points that the basic spirit of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference's resolution on economic issues is to oppose the exploitation and control of colonialism and imperialism, and to strengthen equal and mutually beneficial cooperation between Asian and African countries to develop national economies. The Soviet delegation at the conference expressed its willingness to provide economic, financial, and technical assistance to underdeveloped Asian and African countries without any conditions, which was warmly supported and endorsed by delegates from all countries. Therefore, even if individual countries' delegations had different views on the economic problems of Asia and Africa, or even had different intentions, due to the joint discussions and consultations at the conference, they either withdrew on their own or did not propose them at all. Finally, a common agreement was reached. This shows that the eyes of the awakened people of Asian and African countries are sharp and bright, and they can choose their own correct path. It also shows that the unity of the standing-up people of Asian and African countries can overcome any obstruction and difficulty, and can move towards their own bright future.
    The conference's resolution on cultural issues is mainly based on the Chinese delegation's report on cultural issues. This report pointed out that colonialism suppressed national cultures and hindered cultural exchanges, called for the promotion of cultural cooperation between countries, and emphasized the important role of culture in promoting political, economic, and social unity. After reiterating the resolution on cultural cooperation passed by the Bandung Conference, the resolution calls on Asian and African countries to restore ancient cultural contacts based on the situation of modern culture, advocates developing Asian and African cultural cooperation within the scope of broader world cooperation, and requires more advanced countries to provide assistance to underdeveloped countries in education, science, and technology.
    Based on the above basic requirements, the conference resolution put forward a series of specific proposals, including the exchange of various cultural materials, mutual visits by cultural figures from various countries, mutual translation and publication of each other's works, the mutual establishment of cultural centers, the establishment of various Asian and African cultural associations, the establishment of Asian and African cultural awards, and the signing of cultural cooperation agreements between countries, and so on. The resolution particularly urges the Asian and African countries to maintain their national cultural heritage and folk cultural heritage; encourages the press of various countries to carry out propaganda for Asian-African solidarity, and requires the governments of various countries to pay attention to scientific research.
    The cultural resolution is also full of enthusiasm for demanding peace, opposing war, and supporting the just struggle of the people for independence and freedom. For example, the twelfth item of the resolution says: The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference "expresses its respect for all efforts made by countries to use literature, art, and science for the cause of peace and prosperity, and calls on cultural organizations and intellectual leaders around the world to prepare public opinion in their countries and exert moral pressure on their governments to promote the full use of literature, art, and science for the cause of peace and prosperity; and condemns the use of science for destructive purposes." The sixteenth item of the resolution strongly condemns the arbitrary measures of "closing schools, expelling teachers, and imprisoning students in all countries struggling for their independence and freedom," and expresses warm respect to the people of these countries. The resolution also calls on countries to provide greater convenience to students from the above-mentioned countries in terms of enrollment and further education; and at the same time suggests revising the textbooks used in schools in various countries in order to eliminate incorrect knowledge existing due to imperialist influence.
    Undoubtedly, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference's unanimous resolution on cultural issues is of great significance for the prosperity of the cultures of the Asian and African nations and for strengthening mutual cultural exchanges. Our people will work with the people of Asian and African countries to implement the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference's resolution on cultural issues, to strive for the prosperity of the national cultures of Asian and African countries and human culture, and to make contributions worthy of our great ancestors.
    In short, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference's unanimous resolutions on economic and cultural issues, like the resolutions on imperialism and on other political issues, are a concrete manifestation of the unity of the 1.7 billion people of Asia and Africa in the great struggle to strive for and safeguard national independence, freedom, equality, and peace, to defend world lasting peace, and to build a prosperous and happy life. In order to strive for and consolidate national independence, freedom, equality, and lasting peace, the Asian and African people must simultaneously carry out heroic struggles and arduous construction work in the political, economic, and cultural fields. Only by eliminating colonialism and achieving national independence can we maintain world lasting peace and carry out economic and cultural construction; and all these struggles and construction work require the people of all countries to unite and carry them out together. At the same time, through economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between countries, we will surely be able to effectively further strengthen the friendly unity of the people of all countries and help them in their struggle for independence, freedom, and world peace. Now the people of Asia and Africa are united, and have reached a basic program for carrying out struggles and cooperating with each other in the political, economic, and cultural fields. They have also pointed out the new development direction and path for the people of Asian and African countries to carry out economic construction and cultural construction. We believe that the awakened and standing-up people of Asian and African countries, together with the people of all countries in the world, are full of unparalleled confidence and strength in building a peaceful, happy, and progressive life. And this Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is an important milestone in the friendly unity and common progress of the Asian and African people. Therefore, let us further unite with the people of Asian and African countries and the people of all countries in the world, strengthen friendly ties and mutual cooperation, and strive to implement the various resolutions of the conference, to strive for the realization of the beautiful, happy, peaceful, and progressive life of mankind. The future belongs to us, and victory belongs to us.

　　促进亚非各国的经济和文化合作
　　楚图南
    亚非人民团结大会是亚非历史上一次规模最大的民间性的国际会议。无论从出席的国家或代表的成份来看，这次会议都有极为广泛的代表性。会议的内容是十分广泛而丰富的，它涉及了当前亚非人民所关心的各方面的问题，并且经过热烈而融洽的讨论以后，都作出了一致的决议。这些决议表达了亚非人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立、自由和平等，保卫世界和平和建设繁荣幸福的生活的共同要求。在这些共同要求的基础上，亚非人民达到了空前的团结。这是伟大的万隆精神的发展，也是世界和平力量的胜利。
    亚非人民坚决反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立，保卫世界和平，并且要求从经济、文化两方面来建设自己的繁荣幸福的生活。亚非人民的密切团结和合作，不仅对争取和巩固民族独立的伟大斗争是十分必要的，同样对亚非各国的经济文化建设也极其重要。由于殖民主义长期的奴役、剥削和摧残，亚非许多国家今天仍陷于经济贫困和现代文化落后的境地，这就决定了各国在获得民族独立与和平环境以后，为了发展经济、复兴民族文化和建设新文化，有必要实行互助合作，并且采取某些积极的集体措施。在这次亚非人民团结大会上的发言和讨论中，充分地反映了亚非各国人民在这方面的要求；大会并且通过了有关经济和文化的决议，提出了积极的建议和具体办法。这对于发展各国间的经济与文化交流，也将起良好的推动作用。
    亚非人民团结大会关于经济问题决议的前言指出：亚非人民所居住的地方占世界的59％，这个地区的矿藏和农产很丰富，人力很多，人口约占世界总数的70％；但是由于帝国主义的侵略和奴役，许多国家的独立丧失了，它们经济落后，生活水平低下，失业现象普遍，人民受教育的机会不充分。今天，虽然不少国家已经获得独立，但是它们的经济仍然受到残暴的帝国主义者的控制，它们仍然是帝国主义垄断资本家侵略和剥削的对象。亚非两洲有一亿五千万人民至今仍然受着帝国主义的折磨，他们的资源仍然遭受掠夺。亚非人民认识到，在他们目前争取和维护民族独立的伟大运动中，不仅必须在政治方面而且必须在经济方面密切合作，因为如果不发展经济，他们的独立就无法维持和巩固、他们的社会的物质和文化水平就无法增进和提高。
    决议的前言最后说：“不同的经济范畴之间的这种合作和团结将巩固它们的民族独立和促进世界和平。”这便是通过各国人民切身的经验所得出的一致的结论。
    上述决议的具体建议中包括许多重要的条款，例如宣布国有化是每个国家所拥有的合法手段和权利，就是对亚非许多国家目前在经济战线上打击殖民主义的一个有力的支持。在贸易方面，决议强调了不加任何歧视或限制发展各国之间的贸易的必要性，并且宣布：由于社会和经济制度不同而强加的这种歧视和限制是不正当的，因此应当取消。关于发展农业和工业方面，决议明确指出，亚非国家的经济不发达和生活水平的低下，其原因大部分是由于亚非国家的国民经济遭受帝国主义的控制而造成的。为了摆脱帝国主义的这种控制，决议中规定：外国对亚非国家的投资和贷款不能附带政治条件或具有一种限制或操纵接受国的经济的性质，也不应该有超过民族资本的特权。值得注意的是，当帝国主义正企图在亚非许多国家以种种新的鬼蜮伎俩施行经济侵略的今天，这一规定是特别有意义的。亚非人民一面坚决抵抗帝国主义的新的阴谋，一面在工农业建设中实行自力更生和互助合作，因此大会决议中接着即要求亚非各国的政府和有关机构一同来组织交换经济和技术资料和情报以及互派各个生产部门的专家。
    大会特别研究了附属国的经济情况，认为由于许多国家的人民获得了解放，使得殖民国家的世界市场缩小，于是殖民国家用尽一切力量来进一步剥削附属国家的天然资源。决议中指出：“名为附属国社会经济发展计划的那些计划会助长一小撮外国公司的产业同民族资本的发展不相称的情况，而对后者是有害的。”决议揭露了帝国主义的欧洲共同市场的本质。它说：“欧洲共同市场的目的是要限制附属国的经济领域，把附属国当作六个欧洲国家的财产；而且，它还会使外国资本大量集中到它们的领土上，从而进一步扼杀人民要求摆脱殖民统治的愿望；最后它会促使这些附属国同独立的亚非国家分开。”决议号召人们有效地援助附属国人民进行从殖民主义压迫下解放出来的斗争。
    从以上列举的要点中不难看出，亚非人民团结大会关于经济问题的决议，其基本精神是反对殖民主义、帝国主义的剥削和控制，加强亚非各国间平等互利的合作，来发展民族经济。苏联代表团在大会上表示愿意不附带任何条件对不发达的亚非国家提供经济、财政和技术援助，受到了各国代表的热烈支持和拥护。因此，即使有个别国家的代表团对亚非的经济问题有着不同的看法，甚至还有着不同的企图，但由于大会上的共同讨论、协商，它们或者自行撤回，或者根本没有提出。最后终于达成共同一致的协议。这说明了觉醒了的亚非各国人民的眼睛是雪亮的，可以选择自己的正确的大道，也说明了站立起来的亚非各国人民的团结的力量可以排除任何的阻挠和困难，可以走向自己的光明的未来。
    大会关于文化问题的决议主要是根据中国代表团关于文化问题的报告。这个报告指出殖民主义压抑了民族文化并阻碍了文化交流，号召促进各国间的文化合作，并强调文化在促进政治、经济和社会团结中所起的重要作用。决议在重申万隆会议所通过的关于文化合作的决议以后，呼吁亚非各国根据现代文化的情况来恢复古老的文化接触，主张在更广泛的世界合作的范围内发展亚非的文化合作，并且要求在教育及科学技术方面由比较先进的国家给不发达的国家以援助。
    根据上述基本要求，大会决议中提出了一系列的具体建议，内容包括各种文化资料的交流，各国文化界人士的相互访问，相互翻译出版对方的著作，相互设立文化中心，成立亚非文化界各类协会，设立亚非文化奖金，以及各国互相缔结文化合作协定，等等。决议特别敦促各亚非国家维护它们的民族文化遗产和民间文化遗产；鼓励各国新闻界进行亚非团结的宣传，并要求各国政府重视科学研究。
    文化决议中也充满着要求和平、反对战争和支持人民争取独立自由的正义斗争的热情。例如决议第十二项这样说：亚非人民团结大会“向各国为了把文学、艺术和科学用于和平和繁荣的事业而作的一切努力表示敬意，呼吁全世界的文化组织和知识界领袖在他们国家内准备舆论，并且对他们的政府施加道义上的压力，以促进把文学、艺术和科学完全用于和平和繁荣事业；并且谴责把科学用于毁灭用途。”决议第十六项强烈地谴责了“在一切为自己的独立和自由而斗争的国家内关闭学校、驱逐教师和监禁学生”等的专横措施，并且向这些国家的人民表示热烈的敬意。决议还呼吁各国对来自上述国家的学生在入学和进修方面提供更大的便利；同时建议修改各国学校中所使用的教科书，以便消除由于帝国主义影响而存在的不正确的知识。
    无疑的，亚非人民团结大会所一致通过的关于文化问题的决议，对于繁荣亚非各民族的文化和加强相互间的文化交流，是有重大意义的。我国人民将同亚非各国人民一道，为贯彻亚非人民团结大会关于文化问题的决议，为亚非各国民族文化和人类文化的繁荣而努力，并作出无愧于我们伟大祖先的贡献。
    总之，亚非人民团结大会所一致通过的关于经济问题和文化问题的决议，正像关于帝国主义和关于其他政治问题的决议一样，是亚非十七亿人民在争取和维护民族独立、自由和平等，保卫世界持久和平和建设繁荣幸福生活的伟大斗争中团结一致的具体表现。亚非人民为了争取和巩固民族独立、自由和平等以及持久和平，必须同时进行政治、经济和文化各方面的英勇斗争和艰巨的建设工作。只有消灭殖民主义、实现民族独立，才能维持世界持久和平并进行经济、文化建设；而所有这些斗争和建设工作又是需要各国人民团结起来共同进行的。同时，通过各国间的经济合作和文化交流，又必能有效地进一步加强各国人民的友好团结，有助于他们争取独立自由和世界和平的斗争。现在亚非人民团结起来了，并且达成了在政治、经济、文化各方面进行斗争和彼此合作的基本纲领，也指出了亚非各国人民进行经济建设和文化建设的新的发展的方向和道路。我们相信，觉醒和站立起来了的亚非各国人民，必然和世界各国人民一道，对于建设和平幸福和进步的生活充满了无比的信心和力量。而这次亚非人民团结大会便是亚非人民友好团结、共同进步的一个重要的里程碑。所以让我们和亚非各国人民和世界各国人民进一步地团结起来，加强友好联系和互相合作，为实现大会的各项决议而奋斗，为实现人类美好、幸福、和平、进步的生活而奋斗。未来是属于我们的、胜利是属于我们的。
