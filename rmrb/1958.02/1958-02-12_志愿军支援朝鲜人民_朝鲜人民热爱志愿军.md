Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th: The Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) and the Korean people supported each other throughout last year, further strengthening their internationalist friendship.

Last year was the first year of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's first Five-Year Plan for socialist construction. The CPV officers and soldiers contributed 637,984 labor days to support the production and construction of the Korean people, exceeding the planned target by more than double. According to statistics from the CPV leadership, last year, the various units helped the Korean people dig 520 irrigation canals and build dikes and dams, totaling 426 li (approximately 213 kilometers) in length. Notable examples include the Unjong Canal, the Bongnae Lake Irrigation Canal, the Dongsan-ri Dam, and the Gomiya Seawall. One unit of the CPV alone contributed 90,000 labor days to the construction of the Unjong Canal. To reduce the burden on the Korean people, CPV officers and soldiers made their own earth baskets, straw ropes, shoulder poles, and other tools for the water conservancy projects.

In addition, the CPV officers and soldiers helped the Korean people build 96 bridges, and build more than 1,000 houses, school buildings, and public buildings; helped farmers sow 4,750 mu (approximately 316 hectares) of land, transplant rice seedlings on 3,390 mu (approximately 226 hectares), weed 15,450 mu (approximately 1,030 hectares), harvest 66,690 mu (approximately 4,446 hectares), reclaim 9,310 mu (approximately 621 hectares), and plant more than 3.19 million trees; helped transport more than 9,320 tons of supplies; and provided medical treatment to more than 81,600 Koreans.

In addition to providing the CPV with substantial material support, the Korean government and people cared for the CPV officers and soldiers as if they were their own children. During festivals, they sent delegations to the CPV units to express their greetings and congratulations. Korean art troupes also frequently performed for the CPV officers and soldiers.

During the "Sino-Korean Friendship Month" around the Spring Festival last year, the Korean Democratic Women's League launched a campaign to do something good for the CPV. More than 60,000 items of clothing, shoes, and socks were sewn and mended for the CPV soldiers alone.

    志愿军支援朝鲜人民
    朝鲜人民热爱志愿军
    据新华社平壤11日电　中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民在去年一年中互相支援，进一步加强了国际主义友谊。
    去年是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国社会主义建设第一个五年计划的头一年，中国人民志愿军官兵以六十三万七千九百八十四个劳动日支援了朝鲜人民的生产建设，超过预定计划一倍以上。据志愿军领导机关统计，去年各部队共帮助朝鲜人民挖水渠、筑堤坝五百二十条，长达四百二十六华里。其中著名的有云井水渠、蓬莱湖灌溉渠、东山里水坝、高美阳海堤等，单是参加修筑云井水渠的志愿军某部，即出工达九万个。志愿军官兵们为了减轻朝鲜人民负担，在兴修水利中都自己动手制作土筐、草绳、扁担等工具。
    此外，志愿军官兵们还帮助朝鲜人民建桥九十六座，盖民房、校舍和公共房屋一千多间；帮助农民播种四千七百五十亩，插秧三千三百九十亩，锄草一万五千四百五十亩，收割六万六千六百九十亩，开荒九千三百一十亩，植树三百十九万余棵；帮助运输物资九千三百二十多吨；为朝鲜人民治病八万一千六百多人次。
    朝鲜政府和人民除了给志愿军提供大量的物质支援以外，像对自己的子弟一样地关怀着志愿军官兵，每逢节日，都派出代表团到志愿军各部队慰问和祝贺，朝鲜各艺术团体也常为志愿军官兵们进行慰问演出。
    去年春节前后的“中朝友好月”中，朝鲜各地的民主女性同盟开展了为志愿军做一件好事运动，光是给志愿军战士缝补衣服、鞋袜等就有六万多件。
