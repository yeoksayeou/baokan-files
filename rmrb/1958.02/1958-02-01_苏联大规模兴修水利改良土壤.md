    The Soviet Union Extensively Carries Out Water Conservancy Construction to Improve Soil
    Over 100 large reservoirs built in the past forty years, with a total length of 400,000 kilometers of canals, irrigation and drainage systems covering an area of 20 million hectares, and continuously improving mechanization levels.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st - During the Soviet regime, the Soviet people carried out large-scale water conservancy and soil improvement work. Now, the area of land with irrigation and drainage systems in the Soviet Union has increased from 5.5 million hectares before the October Revolution to 20 million hectares. In addition, vast pastures and newly reclaimed arid areas have been supplied with water.

    Large-scale water conservancy construction has been carried out in the Central Asian republics, Kuban, and South Caucasus, and millions of hectares of swampland have been drained in the Baltic republics and Belarus. In the Uzbek Republic, irrigation is the foundation of agriculture. Currently, the total length of irrigation canals in this republic is 120,000 kilometers, and the irrigated area reaches more than 2 million hectares. The area of irrigated land in Tajikistan has increased seven or eight times compared to before the October Revolution. Out of the total sown area of more than 1.2 million hectares in Kyrgyzstan, 1.1 million hectares are irrigated land. In Belarus, over one million hectares of swampland have been drained during the Soviet regime. Latvia drained 55,000 hectares of swampland last year, equivalent to the total amount of work done in this area during the bourgeois rule.

    Currently, many reservoirs and large-scale irrigation systems are under construction in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Ukraine. The largest irrigation canal in Uzbekistan, the 350-kilometer-long Fergana Grand Canal, is undergoing a major renovation, which will deepen it by 1.5 meters and widen it by 10 meters. The Fergana Valley produced more than one million tons of cotton last year. After the successful renovation of this irrigation canal, it will increase the annual production by 150,000 to 200,000 tons of cotton. In southern Uzbekistan, a reservoir with a capacity of 900 million cubic meters of water is under construction. In Turkmenistan, the approximately 400-kilometer-long Karakum Canal, connecting the Amu Darya and Murghab rivers, is under construction. This is the longest irrigation canal in the world, and it will pass through the vast Karakum Desert. After completion, it will increase the irrigated land area of Turkmenistan by 26%. In the Rostov Oblast, 800,000 hectares of land will be irrigated by the Tsimlyansk Sea in recent years, and a 190-kilometer-long Don Canal is now being opened here. Irrigation systems are also being vigorously constructed or swamps drained in the Hungry Steppe of Uzbekistan, the North Caucasus, and the Baltic republics.

    The level of mechanization of Soviet water conservancy projects is constantly improving. In 1940, only 11% of earthwork in Uzbekistan was mechanized. Now, 95% of earthwork in all Soviet water conservancy construction relies on machines, and 85% of irrigation and drainage work has also been mechanized. Eighteen years ago, 150,000 to 160,000 people participated in the excavation of the Fergana Grand Canal. Now, during the major renovation of this irrigation canal, almost no people can be seen on the construction site, and almost all earthwork is done by machines. (Attached Picture)

    苏联大规模兴修水利改良土壤
    四十年来建成大水库百余个，沟渠总长四十万公里，灌溉和排水系统面积达二千万公顷，机械化水平不断提高
    新华社莫斯科31日电　在苏维埃政权年代，苏联人民进行了大规模的水利和土壤改良工作。现在，苏联有灌溉系统和排水系统的土地面积已经由十月革命前的五百五十万公顷增加到两千万公顷。此外，还有广大的牧场和重新开垦的干旱地区得到了水的供应。
    在中亚细亚各共和国、库班和南高加索等地区进行了大规模的水利建设，在波罗的海各共和国和白俄罗斯排干了成百万公顷的沼泽地。在乌兹别克共和
  国，灌溉是农业的基础。目前，这个共和国的灌溉渠的总长度一共有十二万公里，受灌溉的面积达到二百多万公顷。塔吉克受灌溉土地的面积比十月革命前增加了七、八倍。在吉尔吉斯的一百二十多万公顷的总播种面积中，就有一百一十万公顷是受灌溉土地。白俄罗斯在苏维埃政权年代排干了一百万公顷以上的沼泽地。拉脱维亚在去年一年中排干了五万五千公顷沼泽地，相当于拉脱维亚在资产阶级统治时期这方面的工作量的总和。
    现在，在乌兹别克、吉尔吉斯、土库曼、塔吉克和乌克兰等地正在建设许多水库和大规模的灌溉系统。乌兹别克最大的灌溉干渠——全长三百五十公里的弗尔干纳大运河，正在进行总改建，这个灌溉干渠将加深一点五公尺，加宽十公尺。弗尔干纳河谷去年生产了一百多万吨棉花，在这个灌溉干渠改建成功后，每年将增产十五万吨到二十万吨棉花。在乌兹别克南部，正在建设一个可容水九亿立方公尺的水库。在土库曼，连接阿姆河和穆尔加布河的全长约四百公里的卡拉库姆运河正在建设中，这是世界上最长的灌溉沟渠，它将穿过巨大的卡拉库姆沙漠，建成后可以使土库曼受灌溉土地的面积增加26％。在罗斯托夫州，最近几年中将有八十万公顷土地得到齐姆良海的水的灌溉，现在这里正在开辟一条长一百九十公里的顿河干渠。在乌兹别克的饥饿草原、北高加索和波罗的海各共和国，也在大力修建灌溉系统或排干沼泽地。
    苏联水利工程的机械化水平不断提高。1940年，乌兹别克的土方工程只有11％实现了机械化。现在，苏联所有水利建设中的土方工程已经有95％是依靠机器，灌溉和排水工作也有85％已经机械化了。十八年前，在开凿弗尔干纳大运河时参加工作的有十五、六万人，现在在对这个灌溉干渠进行总改建时，工地上几乎看不到人，差不多所有土方工程都是由机器来做。（附图片）
