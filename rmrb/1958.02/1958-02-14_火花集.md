    Peach Trees by the Sea

    A director from the News Documentary Film Studio wanted to film a scene with peach blossoms by the coast. Spare no expense, he sent people from Beijing to Qingdao, from Qingdao to Yantai, and from Yantai to Dalian, but they could not find peach blossoms by the sea. In the end, they had to insert broken peach branches into the rocks and film it.

    Let's not laugh at his ignorance first—who knows on what kind of beach peach trees can grow? This kind of bourgeois creative thinking and methods that pursue inexplicable "artistic effects" are not unique. Without eliminating these dirty things, the anti-waste campaign in the literary and art departments will not be thorough.

    Beyond Three “Qi”

    In the anti-waste campaign within the Ministry of Culture system, some figures are shocking. One opera performance cost 23,000 yuan; an orchestra affiliated with a film studio bought nine pianos; for the performance of "The Legend of the White Snake," seven sets of costumes were made for the White Maiden; a velvet curtain was made, but discarded because the color was not good, costing 20,000 yuan; the Ministry of Culture's nursery had one staff member for every 1.4 children, with each child costing the public 506 yuan per year. ...Such things are endless.

    It seems that, in addition to bureaucratism, inertia, and extravagance, there is another "qi" that should be opposed: preciousness.

    How to "Do" It?

    It is said that in the anti-waste campaign in the literary and art departments, some people have this saying: "Don't go too far, if we go too far, we will be worried about engaging in business in the future."

    It is right not to go too far and not to oppose what should not be opposed. But the person who said this actually has two meanings: first, anti-waste is in contradiction with business; second, "engaging in business" must cost money.

    In fact, the problem is not whether the opposition is excessive, but whether the "doing" method of that "business" is right or wrong? An amateur troupe in Shanghai has performed more than 30 shows in over a year, with more than 18,000 viewers, and it only cost four yuan. Isn't this "business"?

    海边桃树
    新闻纪录电影制片厂某导演想拍一个在海岸上有桃花的镜头，不惜工本，派人从北京到青岛，从青岛到烟台，从烟台到大连，始终未能找到海边的桃花，最后只好把折来的桃树枝子插在岩石上拍了完事。
    且不要先嘲笑他的无知——不知在什么地方的海滩上能长桃花？这种追求莫名其妙的“艺术效果”的资产阶级创作思想和创作方法，并非绝无仅有，不清除这些脏东西，在文艺部门反浪费是不会彻底的。
    三气之外
    文化部系统反浪费中，有些数字是触目惊心的。一个歌剧演出费用达两万三千元；一个电影厂附属的乐团，就买了九架钢琴；演“白蛇传”，给白娘子做了七套衣服；做好一块丝绒幕布，嫌颜色不好，就废了，价值两万元；文化部托儿所，每一点四个儿童就有一个工作人员，每个孩子每年由公家负担五百零六元。……类此种种，不一而足。
    看来，除了官气、暮气、阔气之外，还有一气，也该反掉，那就是：娇气。
    怎样“搞”法？
    据说，在文艺部门反浪费中，有人有这么一种说法：“不要过火了，反得太过分今后搞业务就有顾虑了。”
    不要过火，不要把不该反的也反了，这是对的。但说这话的人，实际有两个意思：一，反浪费同业务是矛盾的；二，“搞业务”就一定是花钱。
    其实，问题不在反得过分与否，而且在那个“业务”的“搞”法究竟对头不对头？上海一个业余剧团，一年多来，演了三十多场，观众一万八千多人，只花了四块钱，这难道不是“业务”？
