Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd, Washington Dispatch: The Democratic Party in the United States launched its 1958 congressional election campaign on the 22nd. At a fundraising banquet held by the Democratic leadership on that day, former President Truman and Stevenson, the Democratic presidential candidate who failed in the last two presidential elections, launched fierce attacks on the Republican government regarding the economic recession in the United States and the sharp decline in American prestige abroad.

	Truman accused the Republican government of implementing "erroneous economic management" for the past five years, resulting in a "Republican (economic) recession" in the United States and a "crisis of confidence" in American leadership abroad. He said that this situation has weakened the "strength and determination" of the various blocs cobbled together by the United States.

	Truman also criticized the fact that prices are rising despite the economic recession. He said that we spent a lot of effort to launch an artificial satellite, but it didn't take much effort to launch the cost of living into space.

	Truman attacked the various explanations given by the Republican government for the current economic recession and some of the comforting words put forward. In his speech, he tried to give the impression that the United States might be on the verge of a 1929-style great depression.

	Truman also accused the Republican government of lagging behind the Soviet Union in terms of "relative strength," and he took the opportunity to advocate for strengthening the military expansion policy that has encountered enormous difficulties.

	Stevenson, in his speech, attacked the Republican government's five-year record in office as "marking serious failures in many ways," and he accused the Republican government of concealing the truth at home and abroad from the American people. He said that the Eisenhower administration was an almost unprecedented government of "systematic and brazen misrepresentation, concealment, and deception."

	Stevenson said, "From beginning to end, we have been deceived in some aspects that we are deeply concerned about—our military strength, the strength of the Communists, and our position everywhere abroad." He said, "At the beginning, they (Republicans) fooled the people by saying they would 'liberate' Eastern Europe, let Chiang Kai-shek 'out of the cage,' and 'push back' the Communists. Later, they instilled a purely military concept into the American people, promoting the illusion of American omnipotence." But all of this failed. Stevenson also accused the Republican government of ignoring the progress of Soviet education and covering up the weaknesses of various American alliances.

	Prior to this banquet, the Democratic National Committee held a secret meeting to discuss campaign strategies. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution accusing the Republican government of being slow to take action to ease the American "depression (economic) being faced" and of adopting an irresponsible attitude towards unemployed workers.

	According to American press reports, in this congressional election, the Democratic Party originally intended to use the backwardness of American missiles as the main topic to attack the Republican Party. However, in view of the recent economic recession, the sharp increase in the number of unemployed, the strengthening of the American people's opposition to expanding armaments and preparing for war, and the rumor that the Republican Party also intends to push the responsibility for the backwardness of missiles onto the Democratic Party, they chose economic issues as the main weapon in the campaign.

	The U.S. congressional elections will be held this autumn, at which time all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senators will be re-elected.

### 美国经济和威信下降  民主党向共和党政府开炮

    美国经济和威信下降
    民主党向共和党政府开炮
    新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国民主党已经在22日发动了1958年国会选举的竞选运动。在民主党领导机构在这一天举行的募集竞选资金的宴会上，前总统杜鲁门和最近两届竞选总统失败的民主党总统候选人史蒂文森，就美国的经济衰退和美国在国外的威信的大大下降向共和党政府发动了猛烈的攻击。
    杜鲁门指责共和党政府五年来实行了“错误的经济管理”，结果是在美国造成了一次“共和党（经济）衰退”，在国外对美国的领导发生了“信心危机”。他说，这种情况削弱了美国所拼凑的各种集团的“力量和决心”。
    杜鲁门还指责说，虽然经济在衰退，物价却在上涨。他说，我们费了很大劲才射出了一颗人造卫星，但是，把生活费用射上太空却没有费大力气。
    杜鲁门攻击共和党政府为目前的经济衰退所作的各种解释以及所提出的一些安慰人心的话。他在发言中力求给人这样一种印象：美国可能处在1929年式的大危机的边缘。
    杜鲁门还指责共和党政府使美国在“相对力量”方面落在了苏联后面，他并且借此鼓吹加强执行已遭到巨大困难的扩张军备政策。
    史蒂文森在他的讲话里攻击共和党政府的五年执政纪录“在许多方面都标志着严重的失败”，他指责共和党政府向美国人民掩盖国内外的真相。他说，艾森豪威尔政府几乎是一个前所未有的“有系统和厚颜无耻地进行曲解，隐瞒和欺骗”的政府。
    史蒂文森说，“我们从始至终在我们所切身关心的一些方面——我们的军事力量、共产党人的力量、以及我们在国外各地的地位——都受到欺骗。”他说，“开始时他们（共和党人）愚弄人民说要‘解放’东欧，放蒋介石‘出笼’，‘推回’共产党。后来又向美国人民灌输纯军事观念，鼓吹美国全能的幻想。”但是所有这些都落空了。史蒂文森还指责共和党政府无视苏联教育的进步和掩盖美国各种联盟的弱点。
    在这次宴会以前，民主党全国委员会曾经举行秘密会议，讨论竞选策略。会议一致通过决议，指责共和党政府迟迟不采取行动来和缓美国“正在面临的（经济）萧条”，并且对失业工人采取不负责任的态度。
    据美国报刊报道，在这次国会选举中，民主党原来曾经打算以美国导弹的落后来作为攻击共和党的主要题目，但是鉴于最近经济衰退发展、失业人数急剧增长、美国人民反对扩军备战的情绪加强，而且据传共和党也打算把导弹落后的责任往民主党身上推，因此，他们选择了经济问题作为竞选的主要武器。
    美国国会选举在今年秋天举行，届时将改选全部众议员和三分之一的参议员。
