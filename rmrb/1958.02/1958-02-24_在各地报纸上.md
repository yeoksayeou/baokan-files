    On Newspapers Around the Country
    
    Deep Dive into the Treasure Trove of Badashan
    
    On February 17th, the Guizhou Daily published a front-page headline about the Panxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative organizing a team to conduct a general survey of local specialties in the deep mountains. About eighty Chinese miles north of Panxian is Badashan, a place rarely visited due to its high mountains, steep slopes, and frigid climate. In December of last year, the Panxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in order to develop natural resources and help farmers increase their income, organized a survey team to conduct an eleven-day exploration of Badashan. As a result, they discovered ninety-five kinds of local specialties, worth more than 300,000 yuan. Eighty percent of these products were previously undiscovered or underutilized industrial raw materials that the country urgently needs. The discovery of these local specialties could increase the income of local farmers by 200,000 yuan annually.
    
    Combine Two Experimental Fields
    
    The Dazhong Daily reported on February 21st: Leading comrades of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, responding to the call of the Central Committee, took the lead in cultivating experimental fields. On the 20th, more than twenty people, including Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Zhao Jianmin, Secretary of the Secretariat and Governor of Shandong Province, Tan Qilong, Secretary, and Shi Zhe, went to the Shandong Agricultural Science Research Institute to hold a special discussion on cultivating high-yield experimental fields and decided to combine the experimental fields of the leaders of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee with the experimental fields of the Agricultural Science Research Institute. Comrade Shu Tong also proposed that in the process of cultivating experimental fields, the secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee should separately contact the Jianguo and other three agricultural cooperatives near the experimental fields.
    
    A Page Filled with Enthusiasm
    
    On February 17th, the Fujian Daily devoted the entire third page, under the large headline "Total Mobilization of the People, Building a New Fujian," to publishing more than ten letters from readers expressing enthusiastic support and implementation of the resolutions of the Second Provincial Party Congress. These letters came from factory workers and members of agricultural cooperatives, as well as shop assistants, cadres, and residents. They enthusiastically put forward various guarantees. The director of a neighborhood committee in Fuzhou proposed to achieve seven "no's" on the basis of achieving four "no's". The Provincial Schistosomiasis Scientific Research Group proposed to eliminate schistosomiasis in one year.
    
    Multiply Thousands Upon Thousands
    
    Macheng County, which has already achieved the grain, cotton, and oil production increase targets ten years ahead of schedule, will continue to grasp the key of ideological education and launch a production movement to multiply thousands upon thousands. This was the resolution made at the county's conference of activists in industrial and agricultural socialist construction. The Hubei Daily reported on this situation on the 20th. The news said: To carry out this movement, we must strive to complete the Five-Year Plan in three years. In order to further improve the style of leadership, no meetings without on-site visits will be held in the county, district, or township this year. In addition to general crop cultivation, experimental fields are required to further improve to conduct research on varieties, fertilization, density, etc. In addition to experiments on major crops, it is also necessary to study diversified operations in mountainous areas and other aspects of agricultural technology.
    
    Brilliant Achievements of the Health Campaign
    
    The Guangzhou Daily on February 17th and 18th continuously reported on the brilliant achievements of Guangzhou's sanitation blitz. In the three days before the Spring Festival, the city eliminated more than 400,000 rats, and the suburbs alone cleaned up 1,320 sewage ditches. Many streets saw examples of the masses contributing money and labor to build ditches themselves. The masses in Qingping Street alone voluntarily contributed 800 yuan for ditch construction. Zhang Yanzhen, a female worker in a restaurant, saved half of the ten yuan she had prepared for the Spring Festival for ditch construction.
    
    Every Household Plants "Money Trees"
    
    The Shaanxi Daily published two news items on February 17th: the Ankang Special District requiring every household in the district to plant 152 tung oil trees, and the Shangluo Special District farmers planting one sheng of walnuts per household in half a year. At the same time, it published an editorial entitled "Every Household Plants 'Money Trees'." The editorial said: If the survival rate of the walnuts planted by the farmers in Shangluo Special District is 50%, then more than 15 million new walnut trees will be added. After ten years, the output value can reach about 100 million yuan, and each household can increase its income by 250 yuan. If all regions in the province plant economic trees such as walnuts, tung seeds, lacquer trees, mulberry trees, and fruits according to local conditions, the combined number will be even more astonishing.

    深入八大山探宝
    17日贵州日报一版头条发表了盘县供销社组织土特产普查队进入深山探宝的消息。在盘县北面约八十华里处有一座八大山，山高坡陡、气候严寒，是个人迹罕到的地方。去年12月，盘县供销社为了开发自然富源，帮助农民增加收入，就组织了普查队深入八大山去作了十一天的探查，结果发现了九十五种土特产品，价值达三十多万元。这些产品有80％都是过去从未发现过或未充分利用的当前国家很需要的工业原料。由于这些土特产品的发现，可使当地农民每年增加二十万元的收入。
    把两种试验田结合起来
    21日大众日报报道：山东省委和省人民委员会负责同志，响应中央的号召，带头种试验田。省委第一书记舒同和书记处书记、山东省省长赵健民、书记谭启龙、师哲等二十多人，在20日到山东农业科学研究所，对种丰产试验田进行了专门的座谈，决定把省委和省人民委员会领导干部的试验田同农业科学研究所的试验田结合起来。舒同同志并提出在种试验田的过程中，省委书记要分头联系试验田附近的建国等三个农业社。
    充满热情的一页
    17日福建日报三版整版，在“全民总动员，建设新福建”的大刊头下，发表了各方面群众热情支持和实现省第二次党代会决议的十多封读者来信。这些来信，有的来自工厂的职工和农业社的社员，有的是店员、干部和居民写的。他们热情的提出各项保证。福州市一个居民委员会的主任提出要在实现四无的基础上做到七无。省血吸虫病科学研究小组提出要一年消灭血吸虫病。
    千千万万翻一翻
    已经提前十年实现了粮棉油增产指标的麻城县，将继续抓住思想教育的纲，开展一个千千万万翻一翻的生产运动，这是全县工农业社会主义建设活动分子会议作出的决议。20日的湖北日报报道了这种情况，消息中说：开展这个运动，要争取五年计划三年完成，为了进一步改进领导作风，县区乡今年都不开没有现场的会议；对试验田，要求除一般的作物培育外，进而提高到进行品种、施肥、密度等方面的研究，除主要农作物的试验外，还要研究山区的多种经营和其他方面的农业技术。
    辉煌的卫生运动战果
    17、18日的广州日报，连续报道了广州市卫生突击运动的辉煌战果。春节前三天内全市共消灭了四十多万只老鼠，仅郊区就清理了一千三百二十条污水沟。许多街道上出现了群众自己出钱出力修建沟渠的事例。仅清平街的群众就自动拿出修沟费八百元。饭店女工张燕珍，把准备过春节用的十元钱，节省了一半作修沟工程的费用。
    户户都种“摇钱树”
    陕西日报在17日刊登了安康专区要求全区每户种一百五十二株油桐树和商雒专区农民每户半年就种了一升核桃这两则新闻，同时发表了题为“户户都种‘摇钱树’”的社论。社论说：商雒专区农民所种核桃如果成活率是50％，这一下就新增加核桃树一千五百万株以上，十年后产值可达一亿元左右，每户可增加二百五十元的收入。假若全省各地区都根据当地的可能条件，家家户户种植核桃、桐籽、漆树、蚕桑、果品等经济林木，合起来就是一个更惊人的数目。
