I fully agree with the various reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Director Wu Yuzhang, etc., and will strive to complete and overfulfill the tasks outlined in the reports. Now, I will report to the conference on the situation of the great leap forward in production in our agricultural cooperative.

In the past, we couldn't see the strength of the masses, nor the favorable conditions, and believed that it was difficult to increase the yield beyond 400 jin per mu. Now, after curing the "conservative disease," we have decided to reach 650 jin per mu this year and 1,000 jin per mu after 1962.

Our agricultural cooperative is located in Patriotic Township, Ju County, Shandong. The natural conditions are not bad, but our cooperative cadres, especially myself, had conservative ideas. Initially, when studying the 1958 production plan, we proposed increasing the yield per mu from 400 jin to 500 jin. Some cadres still felt it would be difficult to achieve. However, after we overcame conservative thinking and fully mobilized the masses for discussion, the situation changed greatly. The planned yield per mu for 1958 is no longer 500 jin but 650 jin, which is 150 jin more than the target set by the National Agricultural Development Program. We also plan to reach a yield of 1,000 jin per mu by 1962. Among the more than 20 production teams in the cooperative, four have already proposed the goal of reaching a yield of 1,000 jin per mu this year.

Can the cooperative's overall goal be achieved? Before overcoming conservative thinking, we never even dreamed of such high yields, let alone believed they could be realized. This is because in the past, we looked backward instead of forward. We always felt that our cooperative's yield per mu was only 157 jin in 1951, and now it has reached 400 jin, which is already higher than the yield per mu of nearby cooperatives, making it difficult to improve further. Because of this conservative thinking and complacency, we couldn't see the strength of the masses, nor the various favorable conditions for developing production, and we lost confidence in increasing production. The Party Central Committee's National Agricultural Development Program's Forty Articles and the three key elements for increasing production—water, fertilizer, and soil—brightened our eyes. With the help of the provincial and county Party committees and the full mobilization of the masses, we basically cured our "conservative disease." Our minds became clear, and we found the direction for increasing production. Now, we not only believe that we can achieve the targets of 650 jin and 1,000 jin, but also that we can greatly exceed them.

The plan is not empty talk, there are conditions to achieve the targets. Our measures for increasing production include four points.

This is not empty talk, but there are indeed various conditions for achieving this target and endless production potential. Exploring this production potential is also our measure to achieve increased production, mainly in the following aspects:

The first point is that the water conservancy conditions are very good, and we will build more water conservancy projects. In the past, we didn't make good use of water. Existing water conservancy projects can irrigate 7,000 mu, but in the past, we only irrigated 3,000 mu. In the past, when there was water in the fields, we drained it out without thinking about storing it, which resulted in a lack of water during droughts and also caused soil and fertilizer loss. We have been applying manure to the fields in this area for more than 300 years. If an average of more than 1,000 jin of manure is applied per mu per year, then there should be more than 300,000 jin of manure per mu now. So much manure should be a foot thick, and the seeds should be planted on the manure. But why is the land becoming thinner and thinner? It is because soil and water conservation is not good. Now we have decided to implement the policy of prioritizing water storage, and plan to build four reservoirs, four new water storage ponds, and dig 300 wells before and after the Spring Festival, and utilize seven perennial water bays to achieve water conservancy on 90% of the fields in 1958. In this way, we can achieve "water not leaving the mountains, soil not leaving the land," and we can prevent both drought and flood, achieving "guaranteed harvest regardless of drought or flood."

The second point is: Apply more fertilizer. In addition to making full use of various animal manures, we must also produce more artificial fertilizer. Things like sludge, pen bottom soil, discarded house wall soil, indoor, courtyard, and street surface soil can all be applied to the fields. And human urine, which was not collected in the past, will be collected and used extensively in the future. Last year, we applied an average of more than 2,400 jin of fertilizer per mu, and this year we plan to reach more than 20,000 jin, and some production teams will apply more than 30,000 jin of fertilizer per mu.

The third point is: Improve the soil, cultivate carefully. In the past, our cooperative did not have the habit of plowing the land in advance when planting sweet potatoes, and very few other fields were plowed once in winter. This year, we plan to plow and deep-plow all the land once before spring plowing. According to past experience, this is very beneficial for increasing production. We have also put forward the slogan "Turning Sloping Land into Vegetable Gardens," which means that we will manage the sloping land like we manage vegetable gardens. In this way, the sloping land, which had low yields in the past, will definitely produce more products for us, just like vegetable gardens.

The fourth point is: Mobilize all the labor force and semi-labor force of the cooperative to participate in production. In the past, our cooperative had a surplus of labor. Since the construction of water conservancy and the fertilizer accumulation campaign started, we have felt that the labor force is insufficient. In order to solve this problem, in addition to organizing the full labor force to participate in production 100%, we also mobilized the semi-labor force, such as old men and children, to participate in production, and also organized students to participate in labor regularly. In this way, according to the original plan, our cooperative's labor force not only participated in labor 100%, but also 130% to 140%.

The upsurge of agricultural production has begun, "the earth shakes during the day, and the lights are everywhere at night." Everyone is very enthusiastic about production.

The production potential is truly endless, but in the past, conservative thinking blinded our eyes and we couldn't see these favorable conditions. I personally realized that conservative thinking is a stone that prevents the great leap forward in production. If you don't remove it, it will be very difficult to make a great leap forward. Why has our cooperative maintained a yield of 400 jin per mu from 1952 to the present? It is because we have conservative thinking. Once we overcome conservative thinking, the situation changes immediately. This is truly a great lesson.

After the members of our cooperative discussed and formulated the agricultural production development plan for 1958 and 1959 to 1962, a vigorous production movement has been launched since last winter. All men and women, young and old, in the cooperative have been involved in this movement. Water conservancy is being built everywhere, and fertilizer is being accumulated in every household. It is truly as people say, "The earth shakes during the day, and the lights are everywhere at night." That enthusiasm for production is really touching, and it makes us further realize the truth that "man can conquer nature."

Now let me give a few examples to show how great the enthusiasm for production in our cooperative is. In order to apply more fertilizer, the members have dug up a layer of soil from the streets, courtyards, and houses, and even moved the soil from the walls of the old houses that were demolished to the fields. Many lands in the cooperative have been plowed again, and the members plow at night if they can't plow during the day. Old men and old women in their seventies and eighties, and children only a few years old, also participated in the construction of water conservancy and the fertilizer accumulation movement. Every day on the street, you can see children holding ladles picking up chicken manure. I mentioned earlier about saving urine. In order to pee in the urine pot, one of my three-year-old children once went to play on the street and suddenly needed to pee. He held his pee with both hands and ran home, and finally peed in the urine pot. Another time, he went to visit a neighbor, and when he needed to pee, he didn't have time to run home. In a hurry, he peed in the neighbor's drinking water tank. There are really many such things, but due to time constraints, I won't say more.

In order to reflect the upsurge of production and the happy life, the members of our cooperative compiled a clapper talk. Now I will use this clapper talk to end my speech:

North of Jucheng, south of Luohe,
The Patriotic Cooperative is in the middle.
East is adjacent to the Shuhe River,
West is backed by Yuhuang Mountain,
There are mountains, rivers, and plains.
After the Second Five-Year Plan is realized,
The mountains and rivers will be beautiful, and the fields will be everywhere,
The barren mountains for many years will become orchards,
The bad land will become fertile farmland.
Exceeding 500 jin a year,
Crossing the Yangtze River to the south in five years,
The thatched houses for many years will become tiled roofs,
Every household has surplus grain,
Every household has surplus money,
At that time;
Only then will we know that our life is happy.

    搬掉绊脚石  生产大跃进
    吕鸿宾代表介绍莒县爱国乡克服保守思想后出现的生产高潮
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长、吴玉章主任等各项报告，并且努力完成和超额完成报告中所提出的各项任务。现在，我向大会汇报一下我们农业社生产大跃进的情况。
    从前看不见群众的力量，看不见有利条件，认为亩产四百斤再难提高了。现在，治好了“保守病”，今年决定要达到亩产六百五十斤，1962年后达到一千斤。
    我们的农业社在山东莒县爱国乡，自然条件不算坏，可是我们社干部特别是我个人有保守思想，最初在研究1958年生产计划的时候，提出亩产量由四百斤提高到五百斤，有的干部还觉得难以达到，等到我们克服了保守思想、充分发动群众讨论以后，情况可就大变啦，1958年计划亩产量已经不是五百斤，而是六百五十斤，这比全国农业发展纲要规定的指标多出一百五十斤。我们还计划1962年亩产量要达到一千斤。全社二十多个生产队里，已经有四个队提出今年就要达到亩产量一千斤的奋斗目标。
    全社的这个奋斗目标能不能实现呢？在没克服保守思想以前，我们对这么高的产量是连做梦也没想到，更不用说能相信它实现了。这是因为我们过去眼睛是向后看，不是向前看，总觉得我们社的亩产量1951年才一百五十七斤，现在达到四百斤，比附近社的亩产量也高，再很难提高了。因为有了这种保守思想，自满自足，也就看不见群众的力量，看不到发展生产的各种有利条件，也就失去了增产的信心。党中央提出的全国农业发展纲要四十条和水、肥、土三大增产关键，才擦亮了我们的眼睛，再加上省、县党委的帮助，充分发动了群众，就基本上治好了我们的“保守病”，心里亮堂了，脑子清楚了，这才找到了增产的方向。现在，我们不光认为一定能实现六百五十斤和一千斤的指标，而且还相信能够大大超过。
    计划不是说空话，实现指标有条件。我们的增产措施有四条。
    这可不是空话，而是真正有实现这个指标的各种条件，有无穷无尽的生产潜力。挖掘这些生产潜力，也就是我们实现增产的措施，主要有以下几方面：
    第一点，是水利条件很好，多多兴修水利。我们过去对水一直没好好利用，已有的水利工程可灌溉七千亩，可是过去只灌溉了三千亩；过去地里有了水就排出去，没有想法蓄住，结果不光天旱时缺水，而且也使土质和粪肥流失。我们这地方在地里上粪已经三百多年的历史，假如一年每亩地平均上粪一千多斤，那么一亩地现在应该有三十多万斤粪了，这么多的粪肥可铺一尺厚，种子应该种在粪上才对，可是为什么地越来越薄呢，就是因水土保持不好。现在我们决定贯彻以蓄水为主的方针，打算在春节前后修建四个水库，新建四个蓄水池，打三百眼井，利用七个常年存水的湾，在1958年90％的田地实现水利化。这样，我们就可以做到“水不下山，土不出地”，既可防旱，也可防涝，做到“旱涝保收”。
    第二点是：多施肥料。除了充分利用各种畜肥以外，还要多搞人造肥。像淤泥，圈底土，废掉的屋墙土，屋里、院里、街上的地面土，都可以上到地里。还有人尿，过去都没有积起来，今后要积起来大量利用。去年我们平均每亩地上二千四百多斤肥料，今年计划达到两万多斤，而有些生产队，每亩地还要施肥三万多斤。
    第三点是：改良土壤，精耕细作。过去我社种地瓜没有事先翻地的习惯，其它田地冬天翻一遍的也很少。今年打算都在春耕前耕和深翻一遍，根据过去经验，这对增产有很大好处。我们还提出了“坡地菜园化”的口号，就是要把坡下地像侍弄菜园一样来侍弄，这样过去产量不高的坡下地，也一定会像菜园一样，为俺们生产更多的产品。
    第四点是：发动全社一切劳动力、半劳动力参加生产。过去我社劳动力有剩余，自从兴修水利，积肥运动开展起来，又感到劳动力不足了。为了解决这个问题，我们除了组织整劳动力百分之百地参加生产以外，还发动半劳动力，像老汉、儿童来参加生产，还组织学生定期参加劳动。这样，按照原来的规划，我社劳动力不但百分之百地参加了劳动，而且是百分之一百三十、百分之一百四十地参加了劳动。
    农业生产高潮起来了，“白天地动山摇，晚间灯火一片”人人生产劲头都很大
    生产潜力真是无穷无尽，可是过去保守思想蒙住了我们的眼睛，看不到这些有利条件。我个人体会到，保守思想是一块阻止生产大跃进的石头，不搬掉它，要大跃进就十分困难。我社为什么从1952年到现在一直保持亩产四百斤的水平呢？就是因为我们有保守思想。等我们一克服了保守思想，情况一下就变啦，这真是一个很大的教训。
    我社经过社员讨论，制订了1958年和1959年到1962年的农业生产发展规划以后，从去冬以来，已经展开了一个热火朝天的大生产运动，全社男男女女，老老少少，都卷入到这个运动中来。处处都在兴修水利，家家都在积攒肥料，真是像人们说的“白天地动山摇，晚间灯火一片”，那股生产劲头真叫人感动，也使我们进一步体会到“人定胜天”的道理。
    现在让我举几件事，就可以看到我社生产劲头有多么大。社员们为了多施肥，已经把街上、院里、屋里的土都挖了一层，连扳掉的老房子的屋墙土也搬到了地里。全社很多土地都重新翻了身，社员们白天翻不过来，就晚上翻。七八十岁的老汉、老妈妈，只有几岁的儿童，也都参加兴修水利和积肥的运动，每天在街上都可以看到端着瓢的小孩拾鸡粪。前面我说过攒尿的事，为了把尿尿在尿罐里，我的一个三岁的小孩有次到街上玩，一下来了尿，他就两手?着小便，撒腿就往家跑，到底尿在尿罐里。又一次，他到邻家串门，有了尿来不及跑回家，一着急，就尿在邻家的吃水罐里。像这类事，实在很多，因为时间关系，我就不再多说啦。
    我社社员们为了反映生产高潮和幸福生活，编了一个快板，现在我就用这个快板来结束发言：
    莒城北，洛河南，
    爱国社在中间。
    东临沭河岸，
    西靠玉皇山，
    有山有水有平原。
    第二个五年计划实现后，
    山清水秀遍地是畦田，
    多年的荒山变果园，
    不好的土地变成肥沃的良田。
    一年超过五百斤，
    五年跨过长江南，
    多年的草房变成瓦屋檐，
    家家有余粮，
    户户有余钱，
    到那时；
    才知道我们的生活是美满。
