Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party has suggested measures such as establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone and holding an East-West summit to ensure the security of Japan and Asia, and to ease international tensions.

The Japanese Socialist Party's suggestion was made in a letter, written in the name of the Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, which was sent on the 1st to the heads of state of sixteen countries including the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, the Socialist Party International, the Asian Socialist Conference, and the leaders of socialist parties in various countries.

To ensure the security of Japan and Asia, the Japanese Socialist Party advocates that the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries immediately halt nuclear weapons testing and prohibit the manufacture, use, and storage of nuclear weapons; that Japan independently declare that it will not arm itself with nuclear weapons and will not manufacture or store nuclear weapons; and that the United States military be prevented from transporting nuclear weapons and missiles into Japan and establishing missile bases.

The Japanese Socialist Party requests that Japan make efforts to sign mutual non-aggression treaties with China, the Soviet Union, and the United States, either individually or collectively, and ultimately establish a system to guarantee peace in Asia.

The Japanese Socialist Party advocates holding an East-West summit to ease international tensions. The Socialist Party says that the path to a summit should not be blocked by holding preparatory foreign ministers' meetings. The Socialist Party hopes that the central issues discussed at the summit will include: measures sufficient to promote an immediate halt to nuclear weapons testing and a comprehensive ban on the production and storage of nuclear weapons; the demarcation of nuclear-weapon-free zones; the signing of mutual non-aggression treaties; and active ways to break the deadlock in disarmament talks.

The Japanese Socialist Party earnestly hopes that the plan proposed by Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki to designate Central Europe as a nuclear-weapon-free zone can be realized. The Japanese Socialist Party also hopes that nuclear-weapon-free zones will be designated in the Middle East and Asia. The work of promoting and realizing the designation of nuclear-weapon-free zones should be carried out separately from the resolution of disarmament issues.

　　日本社会党写信给十六国首脑
    要求召开东西方首脑会谈
    主张日本同中苏美等国签订互不侵犯条约
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本社会党建议采取建立无原子武器地区和举行东西方首脑会谈等措施，保障日本和亚洲的安全以及缓和国际紧强局势。
    日本社会党的建议是在一封信里提出的，这封以日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎的名义写的信，已经在1日分别寄给了美国、英国、苏联、法国等十六个国家的首脑、社会党国际、亚洲社会党会议和各国社会党领袖。
    为了保障日本和亚洲的安全，日本社会党主张，美、英、苏等国立刻停止试验核武器，并且禁止制造、使用和储存核武器；日本独自宣布，日本不用核武器武装起来，并且不制造和不储存核武器；要阻止美军向日本运进核武器、导弹和建立导弹基地。
    日本社会党要求日本努力设法同中国、苏联、美国等国单独地或集体地签订互不侵犯条约，最后建立保障亚洲和平的体制。
    日本社会党主张举行东西方首脑会谈，以缓和国际紧张局势。社会党说，不要因为召开准备性质的外长会议而堵塞了通往首脑会谈的道路。社会党希望首脑会谈所讨论的中心问题将有：足以促成立刻停止核武器试验、全面禁止生产和贮存核武器的办法；划定无原子武器地区；签订互不侵犯条约；积极打开裁军会谈僵局的办法。
    日本社会党迫切希望波兰外交部长腊帕茨基提出的划定中欧为无原子武器地区的计划能够实现。日本社会党同时希望在中近东和亚洲也都划定无原子武器地区。促进和实现划定无原子武器地区的工作，应当同裁军问题的解决分别进行。
