Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 5th: The leadership organs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army held a grand celebration meeting tonight to warmly celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army "February 8th" Army Day.

　　Attending the celebration meeting were General Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, General Wang Ping, Political Commissar, and more than 800 officers.

　　Colonel Li Guangxue and Colonel Jin Hengyi, representatives of the Korean People's Army stationed in the Volunteer Army, and Li Zhonglie and Li Zhouzhi, representatives of the Korean Party and government organs stationed in the Volunteer Army leadership organs, were also invited to attend the meeting.

　　Wang Ping, Political Commissar of the Volunteer Army, made a report at the meeting. He first extended warm congratulations to the heroic Korean People's Army on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He said that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Korean People's Army has undergone severe tests in the ten years since its establishment and has become a heroic force loved by peace-loving people all over the world. Since the Korean Armistice, the heroic Korean People's Army has always maintained a high degree of vigilance, guarded its positions strictly, and carried out resolute struggles against all enemy provocations, conspiracies, and sabotage activities, maintained the Korean Armistice Agreement, and effectively guaranteed the socialist construction of the Korean people. At the same time, they have also made great achievements in modernization and regularization. The Korean People's Army's bravery, tenacity, fearlessness of hardship, strict discipline, and regularization are all excellent qualities worthy of our humble learning.

　　General Wang Ping said that judging from the more than four-year armistice situation in Korea, Korea is still one of the focal points of the struggle between peace forces and aggressive forces. American imperialism is still constantly carrying out conspiracies aimed at destroying the Korean Armistice Agreement. However, we believe that in this era when the east wind prevails over the west wind, if imperialism does not accept the lessons of the past and dares to launch a war, we will, together with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, teach them an even more severe lesson.

　　Colonel Li Guangxue, representative of the Korean People's Army stationed in the Volunteer Army, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's grand celebration of our Army Day gives our People's Army great encouragement. The Korean people's ardent desire for the peaceful reunification of the motherland has not yet been realized. Now, the American imperialist aggressors have illegally transported atomic weapons into South Korea, seriously undermining the Armistice Agreement. Our People's Army is always watching the enemy with sharp eyes, ready to smash the enemy's conspiracies at any time. The Korean People's Army will resolutely fight together with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to defend peace in the East and the world, and to strive for the peaceful reunification of our motherland.

　　向维护和平的英雄部队致敬
    我志愿军热烈庆祝朝鲜建军十周年
    据新华社平壤5日电　中国人民志愿军领导机关今天晚上举行庆祝大会，隆重庆祝朝鲜人民军“二·八”建军节十周年。
    参加庆祝大会的有中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将、政治委员王平上将和军官八百多人。
    朝鲜人民军驻志愿军代表李光学上校、金亨镒上校和志愿军领导机关驻地的朝鲜党政机关代表李钟烈、李周植等也应邀参加了大会。
    志愿军政治委员王平上将在会上作了报告。他首先代表中国人民志愿军全体官兵向英雄的朝鲜人民军致热烈的祝贺。他说，朝鲜人民军建军十年来在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅的领导下，经受了严重的考验，已经成为全世界爱好和平人民所热爱的一支英雄部队。朝鲜停战以后，英雄的朝鲜人民军始终保持着高度的警惕，严守自己的阵地，同敌人一切挑衅阴谋和破坏活动进行坚决的斗争，维护了朝鲜停战协定，有力地保证了朝鲜人民的社会主义建设。同时，他们还在现代化正规化建设中取得了很大的成就。朝鲜人民军的英勇顽强、不怕艰苦、严守纪律以及正规化的优良作风，都值得我们虚心学习。
    王平上将说，从朝鲜四年多的停战局面来看，朝鲜依然是和平力量和侵略势力斗争的焦点之一。美帝国主义还在不断地进行旨在破坏朝鲜停战协定的阴谋活动。但是，我们相信在这东风压倒西风的时代，帝国主义如果不接受过去的教训而胆敢发动战争，我们将和朝鲜人民以及朝鲜人民军一起，更严重地教训他们。
    朝鲜人民军驻志愿军代表李光学上校也在会上讲了话。他说，中国人民志愿军这样隆重庆祝我们的建军节，给我们人民军极大的鼓舞。朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的殷切愿望还没有得到实现。现在，美帝国主义侵略者又把原子武器非法运入南朝鲜，严重地破坏停战协定。我们人民军随时都以尖锐的眼光注视着敌人，时刻准备粉碎敌人的阴谋。朝鲜人民军坚决地和中国人民志愿军一起，为保卫东方和世界和平，为争取我们祖国的和平统一而奋斗。
