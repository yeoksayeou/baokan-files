　　In order to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, the Korean government has begun construction of memorial towers for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in Pyongyang. In order to build these two memorial towers well, the stone processing plant under the Construction Department is processing granite and marble, and the Fifth Construction Engineering Company under the Construction Department is also preparing the steel bars needed for the project.

　　The People's Army Memorial Tower will be built on the slope of Liberation Hill facing Stalin Street, which is centrally located and easily seen by people coming to and from Pyongyang. When completed, this memorial tower will be twenty-five meters high. A square platform will be built at the base of the four-cornered tower, and a 5.66-meter-high bronze statue of a People's Army soldier will be placed on top of the tower. A five-pointed star is engraved below the bronze statue. The tower is mostly constructed of reinforced concrete and clad in granite. The base of the tower is black, and the color gradually fades upwards. Various inscriptions praising and commemorating the People's Army will also be engraved on the tower, and electric lights will be installed around the tower. This tower will adopt the form of an ancient Korean tower. (See picture on the right)

　　The Chinese People's Volunteers Memorial Tower will be built on the slope of Mount Karugae in West Pyongyang. The design staff devoted all their energy and technology to this design work in order to build a memorial tower for the Chinese People's Volunteers who supported the Korean people with their blood. They have drawn on the form of Korean ancestral stone towers and have now completed the design task. When completed, this memorial tower will be 15.45 meters high. A circular house will be built at the base of the tower, where the roster of volunteer martyrs will be kept.

　　A square platform of 28.59 square meters is left around the base of the tower, and a granite railing is built around it. Stone steps are provided in the front, back, left, and right of the tower. A square copper plate with an area of 47.5 square centimeters is installed on the front of the tower, with the three large characters "Friendship Tower" engraved on it. Above this copper plate is also a five-pointed star with a diameter of about 90 centimeters. The walls of the lower part of the tower are built of granite. In addition, articles on the immortal feats of the volunteer warriors and the profound friendship between the people of China and Korea will be engraved on the walls around the tower.

　　纪念朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军不朽功勋
    朝鲜动工修建两座纪念塔
    本报讯　为了纪念朝鲜人民军建军十周年，朝鲜政府在平壤市分别动工修建朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军纪念塔。为了修好这两座纪念塔，建设省管辖的石材加工厂正在加工花岗石和大理石等石材；建设省管辖的第五建设工程公司也在准备工程所需的钢筋。
    人民军纪念塔将建立在解放山朝向斯大林大街的山坡上，这里位置适中，来往平壤市的人们都很容易见到。这个纪念塔建成后，高达二十五公尺，在四角型的塔底筑有正方形平台，塔顶塑有五点六六公尺高的人民军铜像。铜像下面刻有一个五角星。这座塔，大部分是钢骨混凝土建成的，表面用花岗石修砌。塔底是黑色，越向上颜色逐渐变淡。在塔面上还刻写着各种表彰和纪念人民军的碑文，塔的周围将安装电灯。这个塔将采用朝鲜古代塔的形式。（见右图）
    中国人民志愿军纪念塔，将建立在西平壤加鲁盖山的山坡上。设计工作人员们为了修好以鲜血支援朝鲜人民的中国人民志愿军纪念塔，用全部精力和技术进行了这一设计工作。他们吸取了朝鲜祖先石塔的形式，现已完成了设计任务。这个纪念塔，在塔底盖有一座圆形屋，那里将备放志愿军烈士名册。
    这座塔建成后，高达十五点四五公尺，在塔底周围留有二十八点五九平方公尺的正方形平台，周围还用花岗石建筑一道栏杆。塔的前后左右都设有石阶。在塔正面安有面积达四十七点五公分的正方形铜板，上面刻着“友谊塔”三个大字，在这铜板上面还画有约直径九十公分的五角星。塔下部的墙是用花岗石修砌的。此外，还将在塔的四周墙面上刻画志愿军勇士们的不朽功勋和朝中两国人民深厚友谊的文章。（见左图）（附图片）
