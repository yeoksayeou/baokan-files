　　Ahead of Schedule, Faster and Faster

　　Wuhan Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace System Strives to Be Put into Production by National Day

　　(Our Wuhan Dispatch, January 31st) Reporter Zhang Pei reports: "On the basis of the rectification campaign, organize a production upsurge and strive to put the Wuhan Steel No. 1 blast furnace system into production ahead of schedule on October 1st this year." This is an encouraging message that Li Yiqing, General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, told reporters today. It should be noted that this is the second time it has been brought forward. The first time was from 1959 to the end of 1958. Recently, driven by the great achievements of the rectification movement and the new situation of the national production Great Leap Forward, the workers have put forward a combative goal of advancing it by another quarter.

　　"What are the difficulties? Are you confident?" When Comrade Li Yiqing answered the reporter's question, he said: The biggest difficulty is the timely supply of equipment. Now we are actively solving this problem through the four investigations of checking equipment, checking design, checking labor, and checking material supply. However, an important aspect of ensuring that the No. 1 blast furnace is put into production on October 1st is how the leadership goes deep into the masses and gives play to the creativity and initiative of the masses. The current situation is that the masses are very motivated. They have proposed: Hard work for fifteen years, not comparing food, not comparing clothing, not comparing ranks and wages; but comparing enthusiasm, comparing work. It seems that the question is whether the leadership can keep up with the enthusiasm of the masses.

　　Today, the reporter saw on the blast furnace construction site in Qingshan that the furnace body of the blast furnace has risen to mid-air, and the second of the four hot blast stoves has been built halfway. The welders are working skillfully in the high altitude against the cold wind, sparks are flying, and the steel is roaring, but the entire construction site is in good order. The chaotic scene that appeared on some construction sites at the beginning of the first five-year plan is nowhere to be seen here. This shows that after the training of the first five-year plan, a contingent of steel industry construction has grown up.

　　The volume of this blast furnace is 1,386 cubic meters, and its height is more than 70 meters, which is much larger than the largest blast furnace in Anshan. And its No. 2 blast furnace is even larger than it.

　　Around the blast furnace, the second generator of the thermal power station is undergoing trial operation, and workshops for coking, refractory materials, sintering open-hearth furnaces, and steel rolling are either completed or under construction. The prototype of China's second major steel base on the Jianghan Plain has taken shape, and the time for it to pour out its first iron is just around the corner.

### 提前再提前　快马又加鞭  武钢一号高炉系统争取国庆投入生产

　　提前再提前　快马又加鞭
    武钢一号高炉系统争取国庆投入生产
    本报武汉31日电　记者张沛报道：“在整风高潮的基础上组织生产高潮，争取武钢第一号高炉系统提前在今年10月1日投入生产。”这是武汉钢铁公司总经理李一清今天告诉记者的一个振奋人心的消息。应当说明，这是第二次提前了。第一次从1959年提前到1958年底。最近职工们在整风运动获得巨大成就和全国生产大跃进的新形势的推动下，又提出了再提前一个季度的战斗性目标。
    “有什么困难？有没有把握？”李一清同志回答记者所提的这个问题时说：最大的困难是设备的及时供应问题，现在我们正通过查设备、查设计、查劳动力、查物资供应的四查运动来积极解决。然而保证第一号高炉在10月1日投入生产的很重要的一个方面，是领导如何深入群众，发挥群众的创造性和积极性。目前的状况是群众的劲头很大，他们提出了：艰苦奋斗十五年，不比吃、不比穿、不比等级和工资；比干劲，比工作。看起来，问题倒是领导能不能跟上群众的这种干劲了。
    记者今天在青山区高炉工地上，看到高炉的炉体已经升到半空，四个热风炉中的第二个已修起一半，焊接工顶着寒风在高空熟练地工作着，火花迸射，钢铁轰鸣，而整个工地却秩序井然。第一个五年计划刚开始时，在一些工地上出现过的忙乱景象，在这里看不到了。这说明我们经过第一个五年计划的锻炼，一支钢铁工业建设的队伍已经成长起来了。
    这个高炉的容积为一千三百八十六立方公尺，高七十几公尺，比鞍山最大的高炉大得多。而它的第二号高炉比它还要大。
    在高炉的周围，热电站的第二个发电机正在试运转，焦化、耐火材料、烧结平炉、轧钢等厂房，有的已经修好，有的正在加紧建筑。江汉平原上我国第二个大钢铁基地的雏形已成，它吐出第一炉铁水的时间已经指日可待了。
