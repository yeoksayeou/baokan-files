Xinhua News Agency, 4th — Tremendous achievements have been made in winter afforestation across the country. From the second half of November last year to late January this year, according to statistics from fifteen provinces including Hunan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Hebei, the afforestation area reached over twenty million mu.

While engaging in large-scale afforestation, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces also completed nearly two hundred million trees planted beside houses, villages, roads, and waterways.

The afforestation movement in various regions has progressed rapidly this past winter and spring. Jiangsu Province, with the fastest progress, has afforested more than 500,000 mu, accounting for 70% of the 1958 plan. The greening task of the 1,010-kilometer-long dikes on both sides of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province was originally planned to be completed in two years. After the afforestation mobilization meeting was held in early January, it was fully completed in less than a month. Currently, it is continuing to advance towards the banks of the Grand Canal, around Hongze Lake, the Huai River, the main canal, and the dam. In addition, it is planned to complete 850 million trees planted beside houses, villages, roads, and waterways this spring.

Hunan Province has completed nearly three million mu of afforestation, accounting for 59% of this year's planned tasks. Among them, Xiangtan Special Zone, Hengyang Special Zone, and seventeen counties including Xiangyin, Wangcheng, Hengshan, Youxian, Changning, etc., have completed or exceeded the annual afforestation tasks. In some places, thousand-mu forests, five-thousand-mu forests, and ten-thousand-mu forests have appeared and are being created. Hunan Province is also vigorously carrying out the integration of grain and forestry. The area of ​​intercropping grain in afforestation areas in each county is required to reach 40-95% of the total area. In order to ensure the quality of afforestation, each county has established more than 25,000 afforestation professional teams to carry out year-round protection and nurturing of newly afforested areas, and to carry out "four checks and five comparisons," so that the survival rate of young trees is generally increased to more than 90%.

As of January 21, Henan Province had afforested more than 1.48 million mu, exceeding the winter afforestation plan task by 31%, and relentlessly launched the spring afforestation movement. In addition to exceeding the winter afforestation task by one time, Xuchang Special Zone has prepared more than 300,000 mu of land for future afforestation.

Anhui Province has completed an afforestation area of ​​more than 1.28 million mu, accounting for 31% of the task for this past winter and spring. Xiao County, Lingbi County, and Su County in northern Anhui have exceeded their tasks.

    河南省到1月21日已造林一百四十八万多亩，额超31％完成冬季的造林计划任务，并且毫不停歇地展开春季造林运动。许昌专区除超额一倍完成冬季造林任务以外，已经为今后造林整地三十多万亩。
