Notes

    Such a "Family"
    According to recent reports in South Korean newspapers, U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are constantly committing evil deeds and numerous crimes. The South Korean people regard the U.S. military as a scourge and hate them to the bone.
    However, Lieutenant General Trudeau, who just relinquished his command of the U.S. First Corps stationed in South Korea, shamelessly told reporters before leaving South Korea, "We are all one family here," when discussing the relationship between the U.S. military and the South Korean people.
    What kind of "family" is this? Such "flesh and blood" should be separated as soon as possible.

    如此“一家人”
    据南朝鲜报刊最近报道，美国在南朝鲜的驻军不断为非作歹，犯案累累，南朝鲜人民把美军看作洪水猛兽，恨之入骨。
    但是刚解除驻在南朝鲜的美国第一兵团司令职务的特鲁多中将，在离开南朝鲜之前对记者谈到美军和南朝鲜人民的关系时，竟毫不脸红地说：“我们在这里都是一家人”。
    这算是什么样的“一家人”呢？这样的“骨肉”还是趁早拆散了好。
