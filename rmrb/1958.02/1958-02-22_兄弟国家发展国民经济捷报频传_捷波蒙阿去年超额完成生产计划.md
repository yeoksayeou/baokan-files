Xinhua News Agency reports: State Statistical Bureaus of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Mongolia, and Albania have successively published communiques on the implementation of the 1957 national economic plans. Czechoslovakia, Poland, Mongolia, and Albania all overfulfilled their 1957 industrial and agricultural production plans.

Czechoslovakia

Czechoslovakia's total industrial output plan for 1957 was fulfilled by 102.3%, and the total industrial output value increased by 10.2% compared with 1956, of which means of production increased by 9.7% and consumer goods increased by 10.9%. The total industrial output in 1957 increased 1.7 times compared with 1948 and nearly two times compared with 1937.

In 1957, the output of some important industrial products reached the following scale: 24.2 million tons of hard coal, 49 million tons of lignite, 17.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 3.6 million tons of pig iron, and 5.2 million tons of steel. About 22,000 metal cutting machine tools, more than 34,500 cars, more than 21,000 tractors, and more than 79,000 TV sets were produced this year. In the food industry, meat products increased by 14% and sugar increased by 34% compared with 1956.

Industrial labor productivity increased by nearly 6% compared with the previous year, and the production cost of the entire industry also decreased by 0.6% compared with the original plan.

1957 was a year of great development for agriculture in Czechoslovakia. More than 3,000 new unified agricultural cooperatives were established this year. By the end of the year, there were a total of 11,090 unified agricultural cooperatives in the country, owning 61.1% of the country's arable land. Cooperatives and state-owned farms owned 65.5% of the country's agricultural land.

Cooperatives have demonstrated their superiority in production. Last year, cooperatives produced 2.6 quintals more wheat or barley, 3 quintals more corn, 1.1 quintals more rye, and 22.9 quintals more sugar beets per hectare than individual farmers.

Compared with the average annual harvest from 1948 to 1956, the total harvest of wheat increased by 5%, barley increased by 20%, and corn increased by 41% last year.

Unified agricultural cooperatives overfulfilled their product delivery plans, and individual farmers fulfilled 99% of their grain delivery plans.

Poland

In 1957, Poland's socialist industry production plan was generally fulfilled by 105.6% (calculated at comparable prices), an increase of 9.6% compared with 1956. Among them, means of production increased by 9.2%, and consumer goods increased by 10%. The production plans for important means of production such as coal, coke, crude oil, natural gas, rolled products, zinc, lead, aluminum, machinery and industrial equipment, and many consumer goods were overfulfilled. However, the production plans for some important products were not completed.

In 1957, among Poland's important industrial products, electricity output had increased to more than 21.15 billion kilowatt-hours, coke increased to more than 10.8 million tons, crude steel increased to 5.304 million tons, the total tonnage of ships produced increased to more than 147,000 tons, cement production increased to more than 4.48 million tons, cotton fabrics increased to more than 569 million meters, sugar increased to 1.059 million tons, and butter increased to 78,700 tons. Compared with 1956, the above-mentioned products increased by 8.5%, 3.7%, 5.8%, 23.1%, 11.2%, 2.4%, 36.3%, and 26.3% respectively last year.

Last year, Poland's hard coal output was more than 94 million tons, about 98.9% of 1956.

In terms of agricultural production, according to preliminary statistics, Poland's total agricultural output increased by about 4% in 1957. Among them, agricultural products increased by about 2.5%, and livestock products increased by about 6%.

Last year, Poland's total harvest of four major grains (wheat, barley, rye, and oats) reached about 13.6 million tons, an increase of about 12.5% compared with 1956.

Mongolia

In Mongolia in 1957, the livestock in the socialist sector of agriculture and animal husbandry increased by 2.3%. More than 100 animal husbandry production cooperatives were added throughout the country. In this year, more than 22,000 herding households joined the cooperatives, an increase of more than 50% compared with the number of herding households joining the cooperatives in 1956. As of September 1957, herding households in the socialist sector of agriculture and animal husbandry accounted for 34.3% of the total number of herding households in the country, and livestock accounted for 24.7% of the total number. Due to snowstorms, wolf damage, and livestock diseases, the total number of livestock in the country decreased by 4.5% compared with 1956.

In agriculture, state-owned farms and ranches completed 108.2% of the sowing plan, and the cultivated area was expanded by 18.6%. The cultivated area of cooperatives was expanded by 46%. The national potato harvest increased by 55.1% compared with 1956, and vegetables increased by 51.4%.

State-owned industry completed 102.4% of the production plan. Cooperative-run industry completed 106.6% of the plan. The total industrial output value of the country increased by 17.6% compared with 1956. Non-ferrous metals, petroleum, coal, electricity and other industrial sectors all overfulfilled their plans.

Albania

In 1957, Albania's total industrial output value completed 103.5% of the annual plan, and the total industrial output increased by 26% compared with 1956.

Last year, Albania's major industrial sectors all overfulfilled their original production plans. They completed the plans as follows: petroleum industry - 112.5%, asphalt - 101.1%, chromium ore - 104.5%, copper - 132.9%, electricity - 104%, light industry - 107.8%, food industry - 104.8%.

In terms of agricultural production, Albania's agricultural and animal husbandry production in 1957 both exceeded that of 1956. This year was a year of great leap forward in agricultural cooperativization in Albania. The number of agricultural cooperatives nationwide has increased from 881 at the end of 1956 to 1,698 in 1957. Cooperativized land accounted for 58.1% of the country's cultivated land area. Last year, the country reclaimed a total of 22,500 hectares of new land. With the country's vigorous supply of chemical fertilizers and improved varieties to farmers, grain and cash crops have generally increased their yields. Compared with 1956, Albania's grain increased by 26%, cotton increased by 78%, and sugar beets increased by 55% last year.

    1957年，一些重要工业产品的数量达到了下列规模：硬煤二千四百二十万吨，褐煤四千九百万吨，电力一百七十七亿度，生铁三百六十万吨，钢五百二十万吨。这一年生产的金属切削机床达到了约二万二千台，小汽车三万四千五百多辆，拖拉机二万一千多台，电视机七万九千多台。食品工业中的肉类制品比1956年增加了14％，糖增加了34％。
    工业的劳动生产率比前一年提高了将近6％，全部工业的生产成本也比原定计划降低了0.6％。
    1957年是捷克斯洛伐克农业大发展的一年。这一年，新成立了三千多个统一农业合作社。到年底时，全国共有一万一千零九十个统一农业合作社，它们拥有的土地占全国耕地的61.1％。合作社和国营农场所拥有的土地占全国农业用地的65.5％。
    合作社在生产上显示了自己的优越性。去年，合作社每一公顷土地比个体农民多生产二点六公担小麦或大麦，三公担玉蜀黍，一点一公担黑麦和二十二点九公担甜菜。
    和1948年到1956年的年平均收获量比较，去年，小麦的总收获量增加了5％，大麦增加了20％，玉蜀黍增加了41％。
    统一农业合作社超额完成了产品交售计划，个体农民完成了谷物交售计划的99％。
    波兰
    1957年，波兰的社会主义工业的生产计划整个说来完成了105.6％（以比较价格计算），比1956年增加了9.6％。其中，生产资料增加9.2％，消费资料增加了10％。煤、焦炭、原油、天然煤气、压延品、锌、铅、铝、机器和工业设备等重要生产资料和许多消费品的生产计划都超额完成了。但是，有一些重要产品的生产计划没有完成。
    1957年，波兰的重要工业品中，电力的产量已经增加到二百一十一亿五千多万度，焦炭增加到一千零八十多万吨，原钢增加到五百三十万零四千吨，生产的船只的总吨位增加到十四万七千多吨，水泥产量增加到四百四十八万多吨，棉织品增加到五亿六千九百多万公尺，糖增加到一百零五万九千吨，奶油增加到七万八千七百吨。和1956年比较，去年上述这些产品分别增加了8.5％、3.7％、5.8％、23.1％、11.2％、2.4％、36.3％、26.3％。
    去年，波兰的硬煤产量为九千四百多万吨，约为1956年的98.9％。
    在农业生产方面，据初步统计，1957年波兰农业总产量增加了约4％。其中，农产品增加了约2.5％，畜产品增加了约6％。
