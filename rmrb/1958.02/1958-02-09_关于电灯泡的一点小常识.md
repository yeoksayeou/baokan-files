　　Some Basic Knowledge About Light Bulbs

　　The light bulbs we use daily all use tungsten filaments as the light-emitting body. Therefore, the quality of the tungsten filament largely determines the lifespan and efficiency of the bulb.

　　Generally speaking, the average lifespan of a light bulb is one thousand hours. However, the lifespan of each bulb is not exactly the same; some exceed the average lifespan, while others fall below it. Some bulbs burn out very quickly due to poor tungsten filament quality or defects in the manufacturing process. To distinguish between good and bad bulb quality, in addition to checking whether the tungsten filament is easily burned, you can also check if the bulb leaks air, sags, the adhesive torsion of the bulb, and whether the insulation inside the lamp holder is good.

　　The spring tungsten filament inside the bulb is made of extremely thin tungsten wire. If the bulb is subjected to large vibrations, the tungsten filament is easily broken, causing damage to the bulb. Therefore, do not subject the bulb to vibration.

　　The copper head and glass bulb of the bulb are glued together to prevent outside air from entering. We should not twist them with great force.

　　In addition, voltage fluctuations also affect the efficiency and lifespan of the bulb. When a bulb is used at a voltage lower than its rated voltage, the brightness of the bulb will be lower, and the lifespan can be longer. Conversely, when used at a voltage higher than its rated voltage, the bulb will burn very brightly, and may even be burned out. The voltages commonly used in our country are 220 volts and 110 volts. We should pay attention to buying bulbs with the same or higher voltage when purchasing and using them.

### 关于电灯泡的一点小常识

　　关于电灯泡的一点小常识
    我们日常使用的电灯泡都是以钨丝为发光体的。所以钨丝质量的好坏在很大程度上关系到灯泡的寿命和效率。
    一般讲，灯泡的平均寿命为一千小时。但是每个灯泡的寿命不尽相同，有的超出平均寿命，有的则低于平均寿命。有的灯泡因钨丝质量较差和在制造过程中有缺点，使用很短的时间就烧断了。鉴别灯泡的质量好坏，除看钨丝是否容易烧断外，从灯泡是否漏气、弛垂、灯泡的胶着扭力、灯头内绝缘等是否良好，也可看出灯泡的好坏。
    灯泡内的弹簧钨丝是由极细的钨丝绕制而成的，如灯泡受到较大的震动时，钨丝就容易断掉，造成灯泡的损坏，因此，不要使灯泡受震。
    灯泡的铜头和玻璃泡壳是用胶粘合在一起的，以防止外面的空气侵入，我们不要用很大的力气扭拧。
    另外，电压的升降也会影响到灯泡的效率和寿命。灯泡运用在低于额定电压时，灯泡的亮度就会低一些，寿命可以长一些。相反，用在高于额定电压时，灯泡会烧得很亮，甚至被烧坏。我国通常使用的电压为二百二十伏和一百一十伏，我们在购买和使用时应注意购买电压相同或者电压较高的灯泡。
