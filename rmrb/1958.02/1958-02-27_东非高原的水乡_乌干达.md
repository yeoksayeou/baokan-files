East Africa's Plateau Waterland – Uganda

Uganda lies to the west of Kenya. It is a "protectorate" under British colonial rule. Representatives of the Ugandan people, who are constantly fighting for national independence, participated in the recent Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.

Uganda straddles the equator and is located in the central part of the East African Plateau. Its territory is dotted with lakes, and the water area accounts for 14% of the total area. Half of Lake Victoria, the world's third largest lake, belongs to Uganda. The waterfall flowing from the lake is a famous source of the Nile. The country has a population of more than 5,590,000, of which more than 99% are Africans. It covers an area of 243,410 square kilometers, which is approximately equivalent to that of the United Kingdom. The capital is called Entebbe.

The names Uganda and Buganda are often easily confused. Buganda is the oldest and most important kingdom within Uganda, and it is currently the most economically and culturally developed region in Uganda. The "Kabaka" (king) of Buganda is considered the natural leader of Uganda. Britain forced Buganda to sign a colonial treaty, placing it under "protection" and listing it as one of Uganda's four provinces. In addition, Britain also established the Eastern Province, Northern Province, and Western Province in Uganda. The Western Province includes three small kingdoms: Bunyoro, Toro, and Ankole. Britain signed "protection" treaties with each of them. The highest administrative power in Uganda is held by the British Governor.

Ancient Uganda was a powerful kingdom in equatorial Africa. It is said that Buganda has existed as a unified tribe since 1000 AD. Before the arrival of European colonizers, the rudiments of the feudal system had already appeared. In the second half of the nineteenth century, Uganda became an object of contention for British, French, and German colonizers. From 1877, Britain and France began to send large numbers of colonial adventurers, appearing as missionaries, merchants, and soldiers, constantly invading Uganda. At that time, the Kingdom of Buganda, under the rule of King Mutesa I, maintained national independence. His son, Mwanga, was also a fighter for national independence. In 1890, Britain and Germany signed an agreement to divide up the colonies, and Britain allocated Uganda and Kenya to its sphere of influence. In 1893, Britain defeated the Bunyoro Kingdom in Uganda. In 1894, Britain declared Buganda a "protectorate." In 1896, Britain expanded its "protection" to Bunyoro and the entire territory of Uganda. However, the Ugandan people did not succumb. In 1897, a major uprising broke out. King Mwanga of Buganda and King Kabarega of Bunyoro became the leaders of the uprising, fighting for three years until they were brutally suppressed by British imperialism with superior forces in 1899.

Sixty years of colonial rule by the British colonizers have made Uganda a backward agricultural country to this day. The feudal land system prevails in the country. Three-quarters of Buganda's land is occupied by 15,000 large landlords. European colonizers have also seized a large amount of land from farmers. Uganda's main products are cotton, coffee, timber, and fish. It is rich in minerals, and almost all industrial raw materials are available, but the amount of exploitation is still small, and all are controlled by foreign capitalists. The American consortium Monsanto Chemical Company and the Canadian consortium have formed the Uganda Development Corporation in 1952 to exploit strategic raw materials in the country.

The people of Uganda have consistently struggled for national independence and the abolition of British colonial rule. After World War II, the struggle entered a new stage of upsurge.

The strength of Uganda's working class is growing. According to government survey figures in 1953, there were more than 200,000 African workers in Uganda. In 1956, there were five trade union organizations in the country. The workers, together with the people of the whole country, carried out many struggles for independence, democracy, and bread.

In 1945, the first large-scale strike and disturbance against European colonial rulers and their African pawns took place throughout Uganda. In 1946, local nationalists established the Bataka Party, and in 1948, the Uganda African Farmers' Union was established. They both put forward slogans against British colonial rule. In 1949, the people of Uganda held another general strike and grand parade. The British colonial authorities carried out brutal suppression, shooting at 5,000 petitioners who demanded democratic reforms, disbanding the Bataka Party and the Uganda African Farmers' Union, and sentencing some leaders to long-term imprisonment. In 1952, the Uganda National Congress was established. It has now become the largest political organization in Uganda, reportedly with about 100,000 members. In recent years, it has been actively engaged in uniting the various ethnic groups in Uganda to strive for political independence, universal suffrage, and people's control of the economy.

In 1953, Britain conspired to merge Uganda, Tanganyika, and Kenya into the "East African Federation" to facilitate its control. King Mutesa II of Buganda, with the support of the people, resolutely opposed it, and was therefore exiled by the British colonizers and declared a "state of emergency" throughout the territory. This incident sparked a strong anti-British movement among the people of Buganda, and Britain was finally forced to send Mutesa II back to Uganda in October 1955.

Last year, the Ugandan people's struggle for independence became more intense. In February and March, the Ugandan people held large-scale demonstrations. In mid-May, a series of mass rallies were held throughout Uganda to launch the "Week of Struggle for Immediate Independence." The Uganda National Congress issued a declaration demanding immediate and complete independence, and proposed struggle goals such as holding direct elections nationwide and becoming a unified African country while preserving the original systems of the various tribes. The Buganda Parliament also passed a proposal requesting Britain to grant autonomy within a fixed period. The Ugandan people's struggle for independence is rising and deepening. The resolution on imperialism of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference pointed out: "The conference endorses the demand of the Ugandan people to submit their problems to the United Nations," which shows the sincere support and deep sympathy of the Asian and African people for the Ugandan people's struggle for independence.

### 东非高原的水乡——乌干达

    东非高原的水乡——乌干达
    乌干达在怯尼亚的西面。它是英国殖民统治下的“保护国”。为争取民族独立而不断斗争的乌干达人民的代表参加了最近召开的亚非人民团结大会。
    乌干达横过赤道，全境位于东非高原的中部，境内湖泊星罗棋布，水面面积达总面积的14％，世界第三大湖维多利亚湖的一半属于乌干达，湖口流出的瀑布，一泻千里，成为有名的尼罗河的上源之一。全国人口有五百五十九万余人，99％以上是非洲人，面积二十四万三千四百一十方公里，约相等于英国。首都叫恩德培。
    乌干达和布干达的名称常常容易相混。布干达是乌干达境内最古老、最主要的王国，是目前乌干达经济和文化最发达的地区。布干达的“卡巴卡”（国王）被认为是乌干达的当然领袖。英国强迫布干达订立殖民条约，把它置于“保护”之下，并把它列为乌干达的四个省份之一。此外，英国还在乌干达设立了东方省、北方省、西方省等三省。西方省中包括本约罗、托罗、安科尔等三个小王国，英国分别和它们订立了“保护”条约。乌干达全国的最高行政权都掌握在英国总督手中。
    古代的乌干达，是赤道非洲强盛的王国。据说自公元一千年起布干达已经作为一个统一的部落而存在。在欧洲殖民者到来以前，已经出现了封建制度的萌芽。十九世纪下半期，乌干达成为英、法、德殖民者逐鹿的对象。1877年起，英国和法国开始大量派遣以传教士、商人和军人等身份出现的殖民冒险家，不断侵入乌干达，当时的布干达王国在国王穆特萨一世的统治下维护了国家的独立。他的儿子姆凡格，也是一位保卫民族独立的战士。1890年，英德订立殖民地的分赃协定，英国把乌干达和怯尼亚分配到自己的势力范围。1893年，英国战胜乌干达境内的本约罗王国，1894年，英国把布干达宣布为“保护国”，1896年，英国把“保护”范围扩展到本约罗和乌干达全境。但是乌干达人民并没有屈服。1897年爆发了大起义，布干达国王姆凡格和本约罗国王卡巴勒加成为起义的领导者，战斗了三年，直到1899年才被英帝国主义者以优势兵力残酷镇压下去。
    英国殖民者六十年的殖民统治，使乌干达至今是一个落后的农业国。境内封建领地制度盛行。布干达土地的四分之三都被一万五千名大地主所占有。欧洲殖民者也强占了农民的大量土地。乌干达主要产品是棉花、咖啡、木材和鱼类。矿产富饶，工业原料几乎应有尽有，但是开采量还小，而且都由外国资本家控制。美国财团孟山都化学公司已经和加拿大财团在1952年组成乌干达开发公司，在境内开采战略原料。
    乌干达人民一贯为争取民族独立，废除英国殖民统治而斗争，第二次世界大战以后，斗争进入了新的高涨阶段。
    乌干达的工人阶级的力量正在成长。乌干达非洲籍工人据1953年的政府调查数字为二十万人以上，全国在1956年有五个工会组织，工人们和全国人民在一起，进行了争取独立、民主和面包的多次斗争。
    在1945年，乌干达全境发生了第一次大规模的反对欧洲殖民统治者及其非洲爪牙的罢工和骚动。1946年，当地民族主义者成立巴达卡党，1948年成立了乌干达非洲农民联合会，它们都提出了反对英国殖民统治的口号。1949年乌干达人民又举行总罢工和大游行，英国殖民当局实行残暴镇压，开枪射击要求进行民主改革的五千请愿群众，解散了巴达卡党和乌干达非洲农民联合会，并且把一些领袖判处长期徒刑。1952年乌干达国大党成立，它现在已经成为乌干达最大的政治组织，据说拥有党员约十万人。几年来，它为了联合乌干达各族人民争取政治独立、普选权利和由人民掌握经济进行了积极的活动。
    在1953年，英国阴谋将乌干达、坦噶尼喀和怯尼亚合并为“东非联邦”，以利于它的控制。布干达国王穆特萨二世在人民的支持下坚决反对，因此被英国殖民者放逐出境，并宣布全境处于“紧急状态”。这件事激起布干达人民强大的反英运动，英国终于被迫在1955年10月把穆特萨二世送回乌干达。
    去年乌干达人民独立斗争更形激烈，在2月和3月，乌干达人民举行了大规模的示威游行，5月中，乌干达各地又举行一系列的群众集会，开展了“立即独立斗争周”。乌干达国大党发表宣言，要求立即完全独立，并提出在全国进行直接选举，在各部落保留其原有制度的条件下成为统一的非洲国家等斗争目标。布干达的议会也通过了要求英国在固定时期内给以自治的建议。乌干达人民的独立斗争正在日益高涨和深入。亚非人民团结大会关于帝国主义的决议指出：“大会赞同乌干达人民关于把他们的问题提交联合国的要求”，这表明了亚非人民对乌干达人民独立斗争的衷心支持和深厚同情。　　　（新华社）
