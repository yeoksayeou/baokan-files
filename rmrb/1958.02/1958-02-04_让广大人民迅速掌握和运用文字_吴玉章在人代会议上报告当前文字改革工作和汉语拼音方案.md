Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, delivered a report on the current work of writing reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet scheme at the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress this afternoon. The report addressed the current tasks of China's writing reform and the work done in recent years, and focused on explaining the drafting process and uses of the "Draft Scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet," which was submitted to the Congress for discussion and approval.

Wu Yuzhang said that the current tasks of China's writing reform, as far as the Han nationality is concerned, are: (1) to simplify Chinese characters to make them easier for the broad masses of people to master and use, in order to eliminate illiteracy more, better, faster, and more economically among the broad masses of people, and to popularize and improve culture; (2) to promote Mandarin Chinese in order to eliminate dialectal barriers, promote the further unification of the Chinese language, and enable our language to better serve China's socialist construction; (3) to formulate and implement a Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme to annotate Chinese characters and help promote Mandarin Chinese.

Wu Yuzhang then pointed out that the writing reform work in recent years has been carried out in accordance with the above guidelines. He introduced the process of simplifying Chinese characters since liberation, and cited more than 500 characters in the First and Second Tables of the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme. After simplification, the average number of strokes per character was reduced from sixteen to eight, illustrating the great benefits of promoting simplified Chinese characters in children's education, eliminating illiteracy, and general writing. Therefore, it has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people, especially children. He said that from the standpoint of the interests of the broad masses of people, we should affirm that the simplification of Chinese characters has indeed done a good thing for hundreds of millions of children and illiterate people, and it has been done well, not badly. Wu Yuzhang said that there are indeed a few simplified Chinese characters in the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme, especially in terms of homophone substitution, that were not considered thoroughly enough, so they are not used properly or may cause misunderstandings. There are also some characters that are not clearly explained in the scheme, which has led to misuse. The Chinese Writing Reform Committee is now soliciting opinions from all parties and is revising and collating the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme based on the experience of two years of trial use.

　　Thinking of the Laboring People and Future Generations: The Simplification of Chinese Characters Must Be Actively Promoted

He said: From the overall point of view, for the sake of the interests of the laboring people and for the sake of the interests of children and future generations, the simplification of Chinese characters must continue to be actively promoted so that all commonly used characters with more strokes can be gradually simplified. There are still many relatively commonly used characters and some place names that should be simplified. Some of these characters already have popular simplified forms among the masses, which can be considered for adoption; some do not yet have common simplified forms, and their simplified forms can be stipulated on the basis of soliciting opinions from the masses in many ways. After a certain period of trial use, if everyone thinks it is appropriate, then it will be formally implemented. In short, the simplification of Chinese characters is a major event related to the people of the whole country. On the one hand, it should be cautious and not rushed, but on the other hand, positive measures must be taken to continue to promote it in order to achieve greater results. At present, the broad masses of people warmly welcome simplified Chinese characters, but the number of simplified characters is not large, which cannot meet their urgent needs - this is the main reason for some of the differences in the use of simplified characters among the masses. In order to prevent the abuse of simplified characters and eliminate differences in fonts, passive methods will not work, and a positive attitude must be taken in the work of simplifying Chinese characters.

When talking about the promotion of Mandarin Chinese, Wu Yuzhang said that nearly 600 million people in our country speak Chinese, speaking various different dialects, and there are many small dialects within each dialect. Those who use Northern dialects account for more than 70% of the total population that use Chinese. This shows that on the one hand, there are serious dialectal differences in Chinese, the most important of which are phonological differences, but on the other hand, there are also favorable objective conditions for gradual unification. The basis for the further unification of Chinese is Mandarin Chinese, which takes Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation and Northern dialects as the basic dialect. Mandarin Chinese is the common language of the Han nationality, and it can be said that it is also the common language of all ethnic groups in our country. Today, our country has achieved unprecedented unity in politics, economy, and culture. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of the whole country are united to strive for the common goal of building socialism. The people urgently need a common language. Without this common language, it would bring certain difficulties to the political, economic, and cultural life of our people. Therefore, vigorously promoting Mandarin Chinese among the people of the whole country is an important political task.

Launch a Mass Learning Movement to Boost Confidence in Learning Mandarin Chinese

After summarizing the important achievements made in the promotion of Mandarin Chinese since the National Conference on Writing Reform in 1955, Wu Yuzhang pointed out that the results of teaching Mandarin Chinese in many dialect areas have been positive and the difficulties can be overcome completely. As long as the leadership pays attention and works diligently, significant results can be achieved. He said: Promoting Mandarin Chinese does not mean eliminating dialects. Dialects will exist for a long time, and they cannot be eliminated by artificial methods. Promoting Mandarin Chinese does not mean prohibiting dialects, but rather enabling people who speak dialects to learn a common language of the entire nation in addition to their own local accent, so that they can communicate with people from various regions. We should vigorously promote Mandarin Chinese in schools at all levels, especially in primary schools, middle schools, and normal schools; we should vigorously promote the learning of Mandarin Chinese among all cadres, especially cadres at and above the district level and young cadres. On the other hand, foreign cadres should also actively learn the local dialects in order to closely connect with the masses and do their work well. The promotion of Mandarin Chinese should not and will not harm the rights of all fraternal ethnic groups endowed by our country's constitution to use and develop their own ethnic languages. Mandarin Chinese should naturally be mainly promoted among the Han people, but at present, many people from fraternal ethnic groups are requesting to learn Chinese. Therefore, it is possible and should be promoted to learn Mandarin Chinese among fraternal ethnic groups, and those who voluntarily learn should be satisfied as much as possible, which is conducive to mutual unity and mutual learning among all ethnic groups, and in line with the common interests of all ethnic groups in our country. On the other hand, Han cadres working in fraternal ethnic areas should not only respect the rights of fraternal ethnic groups to use and develop their ethnic languages, but also must strive to learn the languages of fraternal ethnic groups.

Wu Yuzhang said that the promotion of Mandarin Chinese is a long-term mass work, and the requirements should not be too high or too urgent. Promoting Mandarin Chinese with Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation does not require everyone to speak authentic Beijing dialect. Such a requirement is unreasonable and unnecessary. Beijing pronunciation is a standard, which is the direction of everyone's efforts, but in specific work, there should be different requirements for different objects. The requirements for children and young people should be different from the requirements for middle-aged people. Any effort made by anyone to make their speech closer to Mandarin Chinese should be acknowledged and respected by everyone, because they are seriously carrying out a serious task. All regions should regularly hold Mandarin Chinese speech contests or evaluations, and give certain rewards to those who learn and teach Mandarin Chinese well. Only in this way can we eliminate concerns, increase everyone's confidence and interest in learning Mandarin Chinese, and launch a mass movement to promote Mandarin Chinese.

　　The Purpose of Promoting the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme: To Help Literacy, Unify Pronunciation, and Teach Mandarin Chinese

When talking about the issue of formulating and implementing the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, Wu Yuzhang first emphasized that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is not a Chinese phonetic alphabet writing system. The main purpose of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is to annotate Chinese characters and spell Mandarin Chinese, in order to help literacy, unify pronunciation, and teach Mandarin Chinese, with the purpose of facilitating the learning and use of Chinese characters by the broad masses of people, as well as promoting the further unification of Chinese, not to replace Chinese characters. As for the future of Chinese characters: Will it remain unchanged forever, or will it change? Will it change within the inherent form of Chinese characters, or will it be replaced by a phonetic alphabet? Will it be replaced by a Latin alphabet-based phonetic alphabet, or by other forms of phonetic alphabets? We are not in a hurry to draw conclusions on these issues now. But it must be admitted that Chinese characters will always change. The past changes of Chinese characters can prove this, and it will always move in the common phonetic direction of the world in the future. Moreover, it can be said that the languages and writings of various ethnic groups in the world will gradually converge and unify someday in the future. However, these do not fall within the scope of the current task of writing reform, so we do not need to discuss them today.

Wu Yuzhang said that the "Draft Scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet," which is now submitted to this Congress for discussion and approval, has been studied by experts for a long time, repeatedly discussed by people from all over the country, and revised many times. It truly reflects the opinions of most people who participated in the discussion and is more appropriate than previous schemes. From the perspective of the historical development of Chinese character annotation, this Draft Scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet inherits the traditions of "direct sound," "fanqie," and phonetic symbols in our country, and is developed on their basis. From the perspective of using Latin letters, the current Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme can be said to be the crystallization of the phonetic alphabet movement for more than 300 years, and also a summary of the Chinese people's experience in creating phonetic alphabet schemes for 60 years. Wu Yuzhang pointed out that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has seven more significant uses: First, it is used to annotate Chinese characters to improve the efficiency of teaching Chinese characters. Second, it is used to help teach Mandarin Chinese. Phonetic letters are an indispensable tool for teaching Mandarin Chinese. Third, it is used as a common basis for the creation of writing systems by ethnic minorities in our country. Fourth, it can be used to solve the translation of personal names, place names, and scientific terms. Fifth, it can help foreigners learn Chinese to promote international cultural exchange. Sixth, it can solve the problem of compiling indexes. Seventh, language workers can use the phonetic alphabet scheme to continue to conduct various research and experimental work related to the phonetization of Chinese characters.

Wu Yuzhang hoped at the end of the report that after discussion by this Congress, the scheme would be approved, and he hoped that it would be gradually and vigorously promoted nationwide. First, it should be used to annotate the Chinese language textbooks for primary schools and the literacy textbooks in the Northern dialect area this autumn, so that thousands of children and illiterate people can reduce difficulties in literacy. He hoped that all levels of government agencies and organizations would vigorously promote the use of phonetic letters to learn Mandarin Chinese among general cadres, and set an example for the promotion of Mandarin Chinese in society; he hoped that people from all walks of life would jointly vigorously publicize, promote, and implement phonetic letters. He said that if we vigorously promote it, it is entirely possible to let students and the vast majority of young adults in the country learn phonetic letters during the Second Five-Year Plan period. This will play a promoting role in eliminating illiteracy, unifying pronunciation, and promoting Mandarin Chinese, which is extremely beneficial to improving the cultural level of our people and promoting the cause of socialist construction.

　　让广大人民迅速掌握和运用文字
    吴玉章在人代会议上报告当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案
    新华社3日讯　中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章今天下午在第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议上，作了“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”。这个报告谈到了当前我国文字改革的任务和几年来的文字改革工作，并且着重说明了提请这次大会讨论和批准的“汉语拼音方案草案”的制订经过和它的用处。
    吴玉章说，当前我国文字改革的任务，在汉民族说来，就是：（1）简化汉字，使它更容易为广大人民掌握和使用，以便在广大人民中更多、更好、更快、更省地扫除文盲，普及和提高文化；（2）推广普通话，以消除方言的隔阂，促进汉语的进一步统一，使我们的语言能够更好地为我国的社会主义建设服务；（3）制定和推行汉语拼音方案，为汉字注音和帮助推广普通话。
    吴玉章接着指出几年来的文字改革工作就是遵照上述方针来进行的。他介绍了解放以来汉字简化工作的经过，并且举出汉字简化方案第一表和第二表中五百多字，经过简化以后每个字的平均笔画从十六画减少到八画，说明简化汉字的推行，无论在儿童教育、扫除文盲和一般人的书写方面都有很大的利益，因此受到广大群众特别是少年儿童的热烈欢迎。他说，我们从广大人民利益的立场出发，应该肯定：汉字简化确实为亿万儿童和文盲办了一件好事，是搞好了而不是搞糟了。吴玉章说，汉字简化方案中的确有少数简化汉字，特别在同音代替方面，考虑得不够周到，因此在使用上还不够妥善，或者可能发生误解。还有一些字在方案中没有交代清楚，因而被人误用。现在中国文字改革委员会正在向各方面征求意见，并根据两年来试用的经验，对汉字简化方案进行整理修订。
　　为劳动人民和后代子孙着想  汉字简化工作必须积极推进
    他说：从整个来说，为劳动人民的利益着想，为儿童和后代子孙的利益着想，汉字简化工作必须继续积极推进，使所有比较常用的、笔画较繁的字都能逐步得到简化。还有很多比较常用的字和一部分地名用字，应该简化。这些字中有些在群众中已有流行的简体，可以考虑采纳；有些还没有通行的简体，也可以在多方征求群众意见的基础上规定它们的简体，经过一定时期的试用，大家认为适当，然后正式推行。总之，汉字简化工作是关系全国人民的大事，一方面应该慎重，不可草率，但是另一方面又必须采取积极的措施，继续推进，才能收到更大的成效。目前广大群众对于简化汉字是热烈欢迎的，但是简化的字数不多，不能满足他们的迫切要求——这是目前群众使用简字方面产生一些纷歧现象的主要原因。为了防止滥用简字以及消除字体的纷歧，决不是消极的办法所能奏效，必须在汉字简化工作上采取积极的态度。
    在谈到普通话推广工作时，吴玉章说，我国说汉语的人民将近六亿，说着各种不同的方言，每个方言内部还有许多小方言。使用北方话的约占使用汉语的全部人口的70％以上。这就说明了：汉语中一方面存在着严重的方言纷歧，最主要的是语音上的纷歧，但是另一方面也存在着逐步统一的有利客观条件。汉语进一步统一的基础就是以北京语音为标准音、以北方话为基础方言的普通话。普通话是汉民族的共同语言，而且可以说，也是我国各族人民的共同语言。今天我们的国家在政治、经济、文化上实现了历史上空前的团结和统一，全国人民在党和政府领导之下团结一致，为建设社会主义这个共同目标而奋斗，人民群众迫切需要一种共同的语言。如果没有这种共同语言，就会给我国人民的政治、经济、文化生活带来一定的困难。因此在全国人民中大力推广普通话，就是一项重要的政治任务。
    掀起群众性的学习运动  提高学习普通话的信心
    吴玉章在概述了1955年全国文字改革会议以来，推广普通话工作所取得的重要成绩以后指出，从许多方言区教学普通话的结果看来，成绩是肯定的，困难是完全可以克服的。只要领导重视，认真工作，就能收到显著的成效。他说：推广普通话并不是消灭方言。方言是会长期存在的，它不能用人为的方法来消灭。推广普通话并不是禁止方言，而是使说方言的人们在自己的乡音之外，学会说一种全民族共同的语言，以便跟各地区的人互相交际。我们应该在各级学校中，特别是小学、中学和师范学校中，大力推广普通话；应该在所有干部中，特别是区以上各级干部和青年干部中，大力提倡学习普通话。另一方面，外来干部还应当积极学习当地的方言，以便密切联系群众，做好工作。推广普通话不应当、也不会损害我国宪法赋与的各兄弟民族使用和发展本民族语言的权利。普通话自然主要应该在汉族人民中推广，但是目前兄弟民族中有许多人要求学习汉语，因此在兄弟民族中可以而且应该提倡学习普通话，并且对自愿学习的人应该尽量满足他们的要求，这是有利于各族人民之间的互相团结和互相学习，符合我国各民族的共同利益的。在另一方面，在兄弟民族地区工作的汉族干部，不但应该尊重兄弟民族使用和发展民族语言的权利，而且必须努力学习兄弟民族的语言。
    吴玉章说，推广普通话是一项长期的群众性的工作，要求不能过高过急。推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话，并不是要求大家都能说地道的北京话，这样的要求是不合理的，也是不必要的。北京语音是个标准，这是大家努力的方向，但是在具体工作中对于不同的对象应有不同的要求。对于儿童、青年的要求，应该不同于对中年人的要求。任何一个人，为了把自己的话说得更加接近普通话一些而作的任何努力，应该得到大家的承认和尊敬，因为他在认真进行一件严肃的工作。各地应该定期举办普通话演说竞赛或评比，对于普通话学得好和教得好的人给以一定的奖励。只有这样，才能消除顾虑，提高大家学习普通话的信心和兴趣，才能掀起一个群众性的推广普通话运动。
　　推广汉语拼音方案的目的：帮助识字统一读音教学普通话
    吴玉章在谈到制定和推行汉语拼音方案问题时首先着重指出，汉语拼音方案不是汉语拼音文字。汉语拼音方案的主要用途是给汉字注音和拼写普通话，以帮助识字、统一读音和教学普通话，目的在于便利广大人民的学习和使用汉字，以及促进汉语的进一步统一，并非用来代替汉字。至于汉字的前途问题：它是不是永远不变，还是要变呢？它是在汉字固有的形体范围内变化，还是被拼音文字所代替呢？它是为拉丁字母式的拼音文字所代替，还是为别的形式的拼音文字所代替呢？这些问题我们现在还不忙作出结论。但是必须承认：汉字总是要变的，拿汉字过去的变化就可以证明，将来总是要走世界共同的拼音方向。而且可以说，世界各个民族的语言和文字，将来总有一天会逐渐接近和统一。但是，这些都不属于当前文字改革的任务的范围，因此我们今天还不必加以讨论。
    吴玉章说，现在提交这次大会讨论和批准的“汉语拼音方案草案”，曾经经过专家们的长期研究、全国各方面人士的反复讨论和多次修订，它确实反映了参加讨论的大多数人的意见，比以往各种方案更为妥善。从汉字注音的历史发展来看，这个汉语拼音方案草案是继承我国“直音”、“反切”、注音字母的传统，是在它们的基础上发展起来的。从采用拉丁字母这个方面来看，现在这个汉语拼音方案可以说是三百多年来拼音字母运动的结晶，也是六十年来中国人民创造拼音方案的经验总结。吴玉章指出，汉语拼音方案的比较显著的用途有七个方面：第一是用来给汉字注音，以提高教学汉字的效率。第二是用来帮助教学普通话。拼音字母是教学普通话所不可缺少的工具。第三是用来作为我国少数民族创造文字的共同基础。第四可以用来解决人名、地名和科学术语的翻译问题。第五可以帮助外国人学习汉语，以促进国际文化交流。第六可以解决编索引的问题。第七是语文工作者可以用拼音方案来继续进行有关汉字拼音化的各项研究和实验工作。
    吴玉章在结束报告时希望这次大会经过讨论之后，把这个方案予以批准，并且希望它在全国范围逐步地大力推行，首先今年秋季的小学语文课本和北方话区的扫盲课本中应该就用来注音，好使千万儿童和文盲在识字上减少困难。他希望各级机关、团体在一般干部中大力提倡利用拼音字母学习普通话，为社会上推广普通话作出榜样；希望各界人士共同来大力宣传、提倡和推行拼音字母。他说，如果我们大力推行，在第二个五年计划期间，让全国学生和极大部分青壮年都学会拼音字母，是完全可以做到的。这对于扫除文盲、统一读音、推广普通话都将起推进的作用，对于提高我国人民文化水平和促进社会主义建设事业是极其有利的。（附图片）
