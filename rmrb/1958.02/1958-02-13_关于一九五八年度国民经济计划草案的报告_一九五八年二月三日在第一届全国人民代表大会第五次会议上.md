Comrades,

I represent the State Council in presenting the draft of the 1958 National Economic Plan to the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress for your deliberation.

**(1) Victories on the Economic Front in 1957**

1957 was a year of great victories for our country on all fronts. Through the rectification movement and the struggle against the right-wing elements, we achieved great victories on the political and ideological fronts. These victories promoted victories on the economic front, and the victories on the economic front, in turn, further consolidated the victories on the political and ideological fronts.

The great victories on all fronts in 1957 resulted in further consolidation of the unity of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the working class, the consolidation of the socialist political and economic systems, and the strengthening of the material foundation of socialism due to the completion and over-fulfillment of the first Five-Year Plan. Looking back at 1957, one can be filled with confidence and hope for our great future.

The fundamental driving force behind the great victories achieved on all fronts in the past year was the nationwide rectification movement initiated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, as well as the struggle against the right-wing elements within this movement. The rectification movement and the struggle against the right-wing elements were a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, continuing the socialist revolution on the economic front (in terms of the ownership of the means of production) in 1955 and 1956.

The original purpose of the rectification movement was to eliminate bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism within state organs and the Communist Party, to raise ideological standards, to improve work, and to welcome the more arduous tasks of socialist construction in the future, accelerating the pace of socialist construction. However, during the mass "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" campaign, the right-wing elements, blinded by self-interest, took the opportunity to launch a ferocious attack on the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, attempting to restore capitalism in our country. Contrary to the wishes of the right-wing elements, their attack aroused the great indignation of the broad masses of the people, immediately placing them in a position of complete isolation. To defend the Party and the socialist system, the broad masses of the people, under the leadership of the Party, launched a powerful struggle against the right-wing elements, achieving a complete victory. Through this struggle and the nationwide debate on socialism and capitalism, a nationwide rectification movement was formed, greatly raising the socialist consciousness of the broad cadres and the broad masses of the people, increasing labor enthusiasm, promoting the development of various construction projects, and improving various aspects of work. The rectification movement has not yet ended; it is currently in the stage of mainly rectifying and improving, and soon it will enter the stage of studying documents, self-criticism, and raising ideological standards. However, people have already felt its great impact and its more profound influence in the future.

Now, let us talk about the results of the implementation of the 1957 National Economic Plan.

First, let us talk about the situation on the industrial front.

According to preliminary figures (the actual completion figures will be available later), the total investment in basic construction for all sectors of the national economy in 1957 amounted to 12.37 billion yuan, far exceeding the original annual plan. The total investment in basic construction from 1953 to 1957 amounted to 48.777 billion yuan, exceeding the total investment of the first Five-Year Plan by 14.1%.

The industrial investment in 1957 amounted to 6.55 billion yuan, exceeding the original annual plan by 4.1%. This year, 642 large-scale industrial and mining enterprises continued construction and 178 large-scale industrial and mining enterprises completed construction, making it the year with the most completed large enterprises during the first Five-Year Plan period. On average, almost one large enterprise was completed every two days. Among the completed enterprises, 22 are part of the "156 projects" designed with Soviet assistance. Important ones include the Benxi Steel Company, the Heilongjiang Steel Plant, the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, the Jilin Carbide Plant, the Harbin Boiler Plant, the Xi'an Electric Capacitor Plant, the Taiyuan First Thermal Power Station, the Jiamusi Paper Mill, and so on. In addition, there are domestically designed enterprises such as the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, the Sichuan Lion's Mouth Hydropower Station, and the reconstructed Andong Artificial Fiber Plant. Due to the completion and operation of these large enterprises, our country can increase the self-sufficiency rate of high-quality steel and alloy steel, establish a modern, comprehensive chemical industry base, manufacture boilers needed for thermal power generation and some heavy machinery currently in short supply, and produce a large amount of industrial paper.

The new industrial production capacity added in 1957 (calculated by annual output) for enterprises under various central ministries alone amounted to: coal mining 1,489,000 tons, electricity generation 3.25 billion kWh, pig iron 810,000 tons, steel 485,000 tons, cement 1,050,000 tons, cotton yarn 520,000 bales, and machine-made paper 77,000 tons.

The total industrial output value in 1957 (excluding handicraft industry output value, the same below), including both existing and newly built enterprises, is estimated to reach 62.81 billion yuan (calculated at 1952 constant prices), exceeding the annual plan by 4.1%, increasing by 6.9% over the previous year, and exceeding the 1957 target set by the first Five-Year Plan by 17.3%. The output of most major industrial products also exceeded the planned output, with increases over the previous year as follows: coal 1,826,000 tons, electricity 2.4 billion kWh, pig iron 1,080,000 tons, steel approximately 780,000 tons, machine tools more than 3,100 units, chemical fertilizers 140,000 tons, cement nearly 300,000 tons, and timber approximately 520,000 cubic meters.

Since the fourth quarter of 1957, after the "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" campaign and socialist education, the sense of responsibility of the working class as the leading class of the state has greatly increased, and political enthusiasm and enthusiasm for increased production and reduced consumption have reached unprecedented heights, marking the beginning of a new stage in the workers' movement. Within the workforce, right and wrong have been distinguished, righteousness has been promoted, evil has been suppressed, bad elements have been isolated, and the number of activists has increased significantly. The broad masses of workers not only exposed many shortcomings in state construction, enterprise management, cadre style, and living welfare, and proposed improvement suggestions, but also quickly improved attendance rates, strengthened labor discipline, broke through many quotas, improved management, and greatly improved the appearance of many enterprises and basic construction units, forming a new high tide of production and construction on the industrial front.

Next, let us talk about the situation on the agricultural front.

According to preliminary estimates, in 1957, compared to 1956, grain production increased by 5 billion jin, reaching 370 billion jin; cotton production increased by approximately 39 million dan, reaching 328 million dan; sugarcane production increased by 309.2 million dan, beet production increased by approximately 39 million dan, hemp and ramie production increased by approximately 10 million dan, and the number of pigs raised increased by approximately 30 million. The total output value of agriculture and sideline production reached 60.35 billion yuan (calculated at 1952 constant prices), increasing by 3.5% over 1956. Due to relatively severe floods in some areas and relatively widespread droughts in some areas after the autumn, the total output value of agriculture and sideline production only completed 98.7% of the annual plan, but it still exceeded the 1957 target set by the first Five-Year Plan by 1.2%.

In 1957, 65 counties and cities nationwide have respectively achieved the requirements of producing 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin of grain per mu as proposed in the draft of the revised National Agricultural Development Outline, and 56 counties and cities have respectively achieved the requirements of producing 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin of cotton (lint) per mu, thus completing the tasks set by the draft of the revised National Agricultural Development Outline ten years ahead of schedule. In Guangdong Province, the counties of Chenghai, Chao'an, Jieyang, Chaozhou, Puning, and Nan'ao, and in Fujian Province, the counties of Longxi, Haicheng, and Changle, and in Hubei Province, the county of Xiaogan, and in Sichuan Province, the county of Pixian, and so on, have an average grain yield per mu of 1,000 jin or more. In Hubei Province, the counties of Macheng and Guangji, in Zhejiang Province, the county of Cixi, in Gansu Province, the city of Dunhuang, and in Hebei Province, the city of Shijiazhuang, and so on, have an average cotton yield per mu of more than 100 jin. According to statistics from more than 340,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives in 16 provinces and cities, one-fourth of the cooperatives have production and income that exceed the level of local well-to-do middle peasants.

After the autumn of 1957, through the great debate on the two roads and socialist education, the nationwide rural areas have smashed the slander and attacks of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements against collectivization, criticized the wavering and spontaneous capitalist tendencies of some well-to-do middle peasants between the two roads, strengthened the determination of the broad masses of peasants to take the socialist road, improved the management of cooperatives, implemented the Central Committee's directive that cooperative cadres must participate in production labor, adjusted the internal relations of cooperatives, and attracted more individual peasants to join cooperatives, thus further consolidating the collectivization of agriculture and the socialist order in rural areas.

The publication of the draft of the revised National Agricultural Development Outline and the issuance of the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation have further inspired the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses. Nationwide, a new agricultural production high tide on a larger scale than in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956 has been launched, especially in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. Currently, nearly 100 million laborers nationwide participate in agricultural water conservancy construction every day. The original plan was to increase the irrigated area by more than 92 million mu from October 1957 to the end of September 1958, but by January 31, 1958, 117 million mu had already been completed, thus exceeding the annual plan in just four months. Taking Anhui Province as an example, this province originally planned to build 8 billion cubic meters of agricultural water conservancy projects in the winter and spring, but later increased it to 16 billion cubic meters. However, by January 23, 1958, more than 16 billion cubic meters had already been completed. The heroic deeds of farmers in other provinces will not be listed one by one here. All the facts fully show that the organized peasants, in striving for the great development of agriculture, have such firm confidence and boundless strength! With this strength, the plan to increase the irrigated area this year and other basic construction plans for agricultural water conservancy can be greatly exceeded.

Next, we will talk about the situation on the transportation and commerce fronts.

In 1957, 1,100 kilometers of new and double-track railways were constructed, including the world-renowned Yangtze River Bridge, Baocheng Railway, and Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. In addition, 516 kilometers of enterprise-dedicated tracks were laid (only the part constructed by the Ministry of Railways). Due to the completion of the Yangtze River Bridge, the two major railway trunks, Jinghan and Yuhan, have been connected, realizing the long-cherished wish of the Chinese people to cross the Yangtze River. Due to the opening of the Baocheng Railway, the richly endowed Sichuan Province has been connected to the national railway network, overcoming the difficulty described by the Chinese poet Li Bai as "the difficulty of the Shu Road is greater than ascending to heaven." Due to the completion of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, the national defense of the southeastern coastal region has been further consolidated, and the economic ties of these regions with the rest of the country have been strengthened. At the same time, the transportation plans for railways, highways, inland rivers, and coastal areas have all been exceeded. Compared to 1956, the turnover of railway freight increased by 11.8%, the turnover of highway freight increased by 8.4%, and the turnover of freight for inland river and coastal transportation enterprises directly under the Ministry of Communications increased by 21.4% and 29.2%, respectively.

In commerce, the total retail sales of social commodities in 1957 increased by 500 million yuan compared to the previous year, and the inventory of retail commodities in the commercial sector increased by more than 2 billion yuan by the end of the year compared to the beginning of the year. Due to the implementation of increased production and reduced consumption, the situation of commodity shortages has been basically changed, prices have remained stable, and the procurement tasks for cotton and other agricultural products have been well completed. The procurement volume of grain has also exceeded the level of the same period last year, but great efforts are still needed to complete the annual procurement task.

In foreign trade, the total import and export trade volume in 1957 exceeded the original plan by 4%.

Finally, let us talk about the situation on the cultural and educational front.

The number of students in school in 1957 increased compared to 1956, with higher education increasing by 9.7%, secondary schools increasing by 15%, and primary schools increasing by 5.5%. Mass education also developed significantly in 1957, with the most achievements in Sichuan, Jiangsu, Henan, and Hebei provinces. The number of hospital beds in the health system increased by 11.7% compared to the previous year. The cultural and publishing industry also developed.

In institutions of higher learning and other intellectual circles, through the rectification movement and the struggle against the right-wing elements, bourgeois ideology was criticized, and the self-reform consciousness of intellectuals was raised. Many intellectuals who were in an intermediate state further aligned themselves with the working class and the Communist Party; intellectuals participating in labor and production, accepting labor tempering, have begun to become a trend. At the same time, the Party and the state have allocated cadres from various aspects to strengthen the leadership of cultural and educational work.

Overall, through the efforts of the people of the whole country over the past few years, especially the great development and leap forward in 1956, the full completion and over-fulfillment of the first Five-Year Plan has been achieved. Through the smooth development of the national economy in 1957, the basic tasks and major indicators set by the first Five-Year Plan of our country have been fully completed and exceeded.

Since the national liberation, our country's economy has been developing at a high speed. However, the development of our country's economy has not been completely smooth; there have been some twists and turns, and it has been advancing while overcoming difficulties. In the past eight years, we have not only encountered serious natural disasters that brought us difficulties, but also encountered difficulties due to insufficient material resources, financial resources, and technical strength. However, these difficulties have been overcome one by one. This is because the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao not only pointed out to the people where the difficulties lie but also led the people to fight against the difficulties with unshakable confidence.

In the spring of 1957, when our country's economy encountered some temporary difficulties in its forward march, the right-wing elements openly denied our achievements, criticizing our national system, national policies, economic construction, and cultural construction as worthless. The malicious attacks of the right-wing elements against the Party, the people, and socialism have been thoroughly exposed and defeated in the face of the people and the facts.

It should be noted that in the winter of 1956, due to the relatively tense supply situation of some means of production and living materials, there were some temporary and local difficulties. As Vice Premier Li Xiannian said in his report on the state budget, we had made some inappropriate estimates regarding some individual issues in financial work at that time. However, the Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao immediately pointed out the correct direction to us. Through increased production and reduced consumption in 1957 and the mobilization of the enthusiasm of the masses through the rectification movement and the struggle against the right-wing elements, by the summer, those local difficulties were gradually overcome, and the development of the national economy was promoted. The products produced by the heavy industry sector in 1957 not only met the needs of the production and construction sectors but also increased the inventory of various industrial sectors and supplemented the state's reserves. The grain, cloth, and other daily necessities produced by the agricultural and light industry sectors basically guaranteed the market supply and supplemented part of the inventory used in 1956. The fiscal revenue and expenditure not only achieved balance but also had a surplus. This process of promoting the development of the national economy and overcoming difficulties has proven the great superiority of our socialist economy and the invincible power of our people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

**(2) Striving for a New Leap Forward in the National Economy in 1958**

1958 is the first year of our country's second Five-Year Plan. The main tasks for developing the national economy this year are to mobilize great efforts from all aspects to promote the high tide of agricultural production, strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture; actively develop heavy industry, mainly increasing the production of fuel, electricity, raw materials, chemical fertilizers, heavy machinery, agricultural machinery, and electrical equipment; according to the available material and financial resources, expand basic construction investment as much as possible, mainly the investment in productive construction; strive to increase the production of living materials, continue to consolidate the stability of market prices, and on the basis of expanding reproduction, appropriately improve the material living conditions of the people; actively develop cultural, educational, health, and other undertakings.

We should strive to achieve a new leap forward in the development of the national economy in 1958 and create a good beginning for the second Five-Year Plan.

Is it possible to achieve a leap forward in the development of the national economy in 1958? Our answer is affirmative. The great victory of the rectification movement and the struggle against the right-wing elements has given us this favorable condition, and the great achievements of our country's first Five-Year Plan have also given us this favorable condition. The improvement of the state administrative management system and various aspects of work has also given us this favorable condition. As long as we can make good use of various favorable conditions, turn the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao to catch up with or surpass Britain in the production of steel and other major industrial products within fifteen years or more into the actual actions of the people of the whole country, mobilize all positive factors, implement the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, we will definitely be able to expand basic construction more, faster, better, and more economically in the new stage, and develop industrial and agricultural production and various undertakings.

The widespread development of the rectification movement, the struggle against the right-wing elements, and the socialist education movement has created the following favorable conditions for us: the further consolidation of the political system of people's democratic dictatorship, the further strengthening of the unity of workers, peasants, intellectuals, various nationalities, various democratic parties, business people, and other patriotic people nationwide, the further improvement of the socialist consciousness of the people of the whole country, and the dominance of active and progressive thinking among the broad masses of the people and cadres, with conservative and backward thinking being suppressed. There is no doubt that the unprecedented socialist enthusiasm that emerged from the rectification movement will have a long-term impact. In particular, the current high tide of agricultural production and construction will definitely promote a new high tide of industrial production.

The achievements of the first Five-Year Plan have created the following favorable conditions for us: in addition to the great victory in the ownership system, through the active efforts of the people of the whole country and with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, many new industrial sectors that did not exist before have been established, and industrial production capacity has rapidly increased. Except for some heavy and precision equipment that we still cannot manufacture, we can already use many of our own manufactured equipment to build most of our heavy industry enterprises and almost all of our light industry enterprises; we can already use many of our own manufactured machinery to gradually equip our country's agricultural sector, transportation sector, and strengthen national defense; we can already use our own produced metals and other raw materials to supply most of the needs of our country's construction projects. In terms of design work, except for some particularly large, technologically advanced, and especially complex projects that we still cannot design, we have also begun to be able to design and build some large-scale, technologically complex projects, such as a steel and iron integrated enterprise with an annual output of 150,000 tons, a coal mine with an annual output of 150,000 tons, a synthetic ammonia fertilizer plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons, a hydropower station with a capacity of about 1 million kilowatts, a thermal power station with a capacity of 400,000 kilowatts, various types of machinery manufacturing plants, and a paper mill with an annual output of 100,000 tons, and so on. Because we have such a preliminary foundation for industrialization, the basic construction of our country in the future will also be able to proceed more, faster, better, and more economically.

Through the practice of the first Five-Year Plan, we have gained a lot of experience in various aspects of work such as industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, and urban construction, and we have initially learned to do many things that we did not know how to do before, being able to do more things with less money than before. We have made some progress in using the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brother countries.

The improvement of the administrative management system, on the one hand, allows various local and national autonomous regions to make better use of local manpower, material resources, financial resources, and resources to develop agriculture and industry, especially industry serving agriculture, and other productive undertakings. On the other hand, it transfers many undertakings suitable for local implementation to local authorities, allowing the central government to concentrate more on key construction, technological transformation, and work inspection, thus promoting the development of the entire national economy.

In fact, the current favorable conditions are not limited to these; there are many more positive factors in various aspects, such as the increase in inventory and fiscal surplus, the reduction of military and administrative expenses and various undertakings, the deepening of the anti-waste struggle, the reduction of construction costs, and so on. Moreover, we must also turn all negative factors into positive factors. In the difficulties we encounter, there are also factors for overcoming difficulties.

Here, we must also point out the favorable international situation. The launch of two artificial satellites by the Soviet Union in 1957 and the meeting of the Communist Parties of more than sixty countries in Moscow marked a new turning point in the balance of world political forces. Since then, the international situation has become increasingly favorable to the socialist camp led by the great Soviet Union. The brotherhood of the socialist countries has been further strengthened, and the brotherhood between China and the Soviet Union has been further strengthened. It is known that the over-fulfillment of our country's first Five-Year Plan is inseparable from the great assistance provided by the Soviet Union and other brother countries; during the second Five-Year Plan period, the Soviet Union and other brother countries will continue to provide us with generous assistance in various aspects, allowing our country to advance more rapidly towards the great goal of building socialism.

The draft of the 1958 National Economic Plan submitted to this conference for deliberation is based on the above-mentioned situation and also retains a certain amount of reserve strength. Therefore, this plan is fully reliable and has the possibility of over-fulfillment.

It is now February 1958. From the perspective of the basic construction investment prepared by the state, the great high tide of agricultural production, and the increased production and reduced consumption movement in industry, the trend of a new leap forward in the national economy this year has already begun to emerge. The people of the whole country should strive in every possible way to achieve this new leap forward in the national economy.

The total basic construction investment for 1958 is planned to be 14.577 billion yuan, an increase of 2.2 billion yuan over the estimated figure for 1957, an increase of 17.8%. The above total investment does not include the basic construction investment of broad agricultural producers' cooperatives, handicraft producers' cooperatives, and other cooperatives. Since last winter, the large-scale water conservancy construction movement in rural areas across the country will be further developed in 1958, which is actually a very large investment in basic construction. Therefore, the speed and scale of basic construction in our country in 1958 will be much greater than in any previous year.

Based on the new situation of the high tide of agricultural production, the total output value of agriculture and sideline production in 1958 is planned to be 68.83 billion yuan (calculated at 1957 constant prices), an increase of 6.1% over 1957. This speed is much higher than the average speed of our country's first Five-Year Plan. In terms of grain and cotton production, the target for 1958 is 39.2 billion jin of grain, an increase of 2.2 billion jin over the previous year, an increase of 5.9%; the target for cotton is 35 million dan, an increase of 2.2 million dan over the previous year, an increase of 6.7%; these speeds are quite high.

The total industrial output value for 1958 is planned to be 64.37 billion yuan (calculated at 1957 constant prices), an increase of 8.19 billion yuan over the estimated figure for 1957, an increase of 14.6%. This speed is much higher than that of 1957. However, it should be estimated that the potential of local industry is very large, and this indicator can be greatly exceeded.

Here, I would like to briefly explain the issue of changing the calculation of the total output value of industry and agriculture to 1957 constant prices starting from 1958. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the total output value of industry and agriculture was calculated at 1952 constant prices. Due to the multiple reasonable adjustments of the prices of industrial and agricultural products over the past few years, the prices of some agricultural products have increased, and the prices of most heavy industrial products have decreased. At the same time, over the past few years, many new types of industrial products have been tested and produced, which do not have 1952 constant prices. Therefore, the 1952 constant prices can no longer accurately reflect the actual situation of the current industrial and agricultural production levels. Therefore, it was decided to start using 1957 constant prices to calculate the total output value of industry and agriculture from 1958. If the 1952 constant prices are still used for calculation, the total industrial output value for 1958 would be 71.96 billion yuan, and the total output value of agriculture and sideline production would be 64.25 billion yuan.

In the industrial production of 1958, the production of various heavy industry sectors will still maintain a relatively high growth rate, and the growth rate of most heavy industrial products will exceed the overall growth rate of industry. The total output value of the machinery manufacturing industry will increase by 27% over the previous year, and the growth rate of many mechanical products will be much higher. The production of various light industry sectors will have a significantly increased growth rate due to the relatively good agricultural harvest in 1957. For example, the output of cotton yarn will increase by nearly 600,000 bales over the previous year, an increase of 12.7%; the output of sugar will increase by 173,000 tons over the previous year, an increase of 20.6%.

These are the main indicators of the 1958 basic construction and industrial and agricultural production plans. Since we may have underestimated the development of the current and future situations, we must pay attention to the changes in the economic situation and the development of various favorable conditions during the implementation of the plan, and timely check, revise, and supplement the original plan, and strive to over-fulfill the plan.

**(3) Arrangement of the 1958 National Economic Development Plan for Various Sectors**

The draft plan for the development of various sectors of the national economy in 1958 is mainly as follows.

**First, regarding basic construction**

According to the main tasks of developing the national economy in 1958, in terms of investment allocation, investment in the agricultural sector, especially the water conservancy construction sector, and investment in the heavy industry sector, especially the fuel, electricity, metallurgy, chemical, and other industries serving agriculture, have been increased. At the same time, in response to the improvement of the administrative management system, investment in construction in various provinces, cities, and national autonomous regions has also been increased to promote the development of local industry facing and serving rural areas and the economic development of ethnic minority areas.

In 1958, the planned construction and newly started construction projects above the prescribed limit total 1,185, including 716 industrial construction projects, 185 agricultural and forestry water conservancy construction projects, 106 transportation construction projects, 47 commercial construction projects, 60 cultural and educational construction projects, 47 urban public utility construction projects, and 24 other construction projects. Among the industrial construction projects, 567 are under the central ministries, and 149 are under local authorities. These industrial construction projects can be completed and put into production this year, with 188 projects. On average, a new large factory or mine will be completed and put into production every 46 hours. All this indicates that the scale of basic construction in our country this year will be further expanded, and new production capacity will be increased more this year.

The construction situation of various industrial sectors is as follows:

**Metallurgical Industry.** The Metallurgical Industry Department has 57 construction projects, and local authorities have 14 construction projects, totaling 71. Important ones include the three major metallurgical industry bases of Anshan, Wuhan, and Baotou, the steel plants of Taiyuan, Shijingshan, Chongqing, Kunming, Daye, and Ma'anshan, the copper mines of Anhui, Gansu, and Yunnan, and so on. These construction projects can be completed this year, with 14, such as the Daye Steel Plant, the Anhui Tongguanshan Mining Bureau, the Jiangxi Tungsten Mine, and the Yunnan Lead Mine, and so on; at the same time, the Anshan Steel and Iron Integrated Enterprise will be basically completed. Due to the completion of these projects, the new production capacity added this year in the metallurgical industry will be: pig iron 1.88 million tons, steel 1.166 million tons, steel products 762,000 tons, copper mining and selection 500 tons (daily processing capacity), and so on. When these new production capacities are put into operation, our country's steel and non-ferrous metals will be able to supply more in terms of quantity and variety to meet the needs of the machinery manufacturing industry and other aspects.

In conjunction with the construction of large-scale metallurgical enterprises, actively developing local medium and small-scale metallurgical enterprises is an important policy of the central government for developing the metallurgical industry. This year, the 14 metallurgical enterprises newly built and expanded by local authorities include the Urumqi August First Steel Plant, the Nanjing Steel Plant, the Hangzhou Steel Plant in Zhejiang, the Sanming Steel Plant in Fujian, the Jiangxi Steel Plant, the Guangzhou Steel Plant, the Guiyang Steel Plant, and so on.

**Electric Power Industry.** The Electric Power Industry Department has 101 construction projects, and local authorities have 18 construction projects, totaling 119. Among these 119 projects, there are 100 power stations, including 76 thermal power stations and 24 hydropower stations. Important ones include the thermal power stations in Beijing, Taiyuan, Baotou, Lanzhou, Fushun, Luoyang, Wuhan, and Jiangsu Wangting, and the hydropower stations in Zhejiang's Xinanjiang and Bazhou, Yunnan's Yili River, Liaoning's Huanren and Dapengfang, Hunan's Zhexi, Sichuan's Guanzhou's Zipingpu, Beijing's Xiaomaling, Fujian's Gutian, Guangdong's Liuqixi, and Anhui's Meishan and Xianghongdian, and so on. These construction projects can be completed this year, with 35, adding a new generating capacity of more than 900,000 kilowatts, which can generate more than 45 billion kilowatt-hours per year.

In the future, the construction of the electric power industry should resolutely implement the long-term construction policy of giving priority to hydropower and auxiliary thermal power proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The relevant central departments should help local authorities build medium and small-scale hydropower stations. The Three Gorges Water Conservancy Hub Project on the Yangtze River should start the planning and design of the river basin and other preparatory work from this year.

**Fuel Industry.** The Coal Industry Department and the Petroleum Industry Department have a total of 200 construction projects, and local authorities have 32 construction projects, totaling 232. Among the 32 projects built by local authorities, 31 are coal mines, with a designed capacity of 70.1 million tons of coal per year for newly started mines. The construction projects of the fuel industry can be completed this year, with 52, adding a new coal mining capacity of 24.42 million tons and a new synthetic oil refining capacity of more than 2 million tons.

Strengthening the construction of local medium and small-scale coal mines can better supply the needs of local civilian coal.

To change the backward situation of the petroleum industry, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed the policy of developing natural petroleum and synthetic petroleum simultaneously. While continuing to actively carry out the exploration and exploitation of natural petroleum, the relevant departments and local authorities must also vigorously carry out the resource exploration of synthetic petroleum and actively create conditions to carry out the design and construction of factories and mines.

**Machinery Industry.** The various machinery industry departments have a total of 77 construction projects, and local authorities have 2 construction projects, totaling 79. Important ones include the heavy machinery plants in Fulaerji and Jinzhou, the tractor plant and mining machinery plant in Luoyang, the ball bearing plants in Harbin and Luoyang, the petroleum machinery plant in Lanzhou, the electric machine plants in Harbin, Xi'an, and Xiangtan, and so on. These construction projects can be completed this year, with 27. Important ones include the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, the Luoyang Ball Bearing Plant and Mining Machinery Plant, the Shenyang High-Voltage Switchgear Plant, and so on. Due to the completion of these factories, the increased manufacturing capacity, calculated by annual output, is as follows: metallurgical machinery 30,000 tons, mining machinery 27,000 tons, heavy machine tools 20,000 tons, ball bearings more than 10 million sets. This indicates that 1958 will be a year of new development for our country's heavy machinery manufacturing industry, strengthening the weak links in the machinery manufacturing industry, and more large-scale equipment needed for the development of heavy industry will be supplied domestically.

**Chemical Industry.** The Chemical Industry Department has 23 construction projects, and local authorities have 19 construction projects, totaling 42. Among them, there are 17 chemical fertilizer plants. Important ones include the fertilizer plants in Lanzhou, Taiyuan, and Jilin (Phase II) built by the central government, the expanded Dalian Chemical Plant, the expanded Nanjing Yongli Chemical Plant, and so on; and the nitrogen fertilizer plants in Sichuan and Zhejiang, the lime nitrogen plants in Fujian and Jiangxi built by local authorities, and so on. These construction projects can be completed this year, with 4. Important ones include the Shanxi Phosphorus Fertilizer Plant, the Nanjing Phosphorus Fertilizer Plant, the Jiangsu Jiping Phosphorus Mine, and so on. This will add new production capacities as follows: synthetic ammonia 47,000 tons, phosphorus fertilizer 548,000 tons, and phosphorus ore powder 300,000 tons. When these production capacities are put into operation, the production of chemical fertilizers in our country will be significantly increased, better meeting the needs of agricultural development.

Encouraging local authorities to build chemical fertilizer plants is an important policy of the central government to promote agricultural development. The chemical industry and machinery industry departments should help local authorities solve the problems of design and equipment supply.

**Building Materials Industry.** The Building Materials Industry Department and the Forestry Industry Department have a total of 33 construction projects, and local authorities have 11 construction projects, totaling 44. Among them, there are 10 cement plants and 23 forestry industry enterprises. These projects can be completed this year, with 7, adding new cement production capacity of 833,000 tons and new timber transportation capacity of 4.85 million cubic meters. To meet the needs of rural areas for water conservancy and other construction projects for small and medium-sized cement, the building materials industry department should assist local authorities in building small cement plants in a decentralized manner and producing a large number of low-grade cement.

**Light Industry.** The Textile Industry Department, the Light Industry Department, and the Food Industry Department have a total of 39 construction projects, and local authorities have 53 construction projects, totaling 92. Among them, there are 15 cotton spinning and dyeing mills, 23 paper mills, 12 sugar mills, and 10 salt fields. These projects can be completed this year, with 31, adding new production capacities as follows: cotton yarn 387,000 bales, cotton cloth 110 million meters, wool and hemp spindles 7,330, machine-made paper 204,000 tons, sugar 345,000 tons, and salt 6.5 million tons.

To expand the textile industry and paper industry, various fiber resources must be fully utilized, and plans for research and implementation of expanding the utilization of these resources should be further proposed.

The basic construction of agriculture in our country in 1958, in addition to the large-scale agricultural water conservancy, soil improvement, and other construction projects carried out by the peasant masses nationwide, the water conservancy projects built with state investment have 73 projects above the prescribed limit. Among them, there are 38 continuation projects, such as the Sanmenxia Reservoir on the Yellow River; the Meishan Reservoir, Xianghongdian Reservoir, Mozitan Reservoir, West Beihe River Treatment Project, and Shuihe River Treatment Project in the Huaihe River Basin; the Yijiahe River Treatment Project and Wanfuhu River Treatment Project in the Yishu, Shu, Wenshu, and Sishui River Basins; the Dapengfang Reservoir in the Liaohe River Basin; the Xigangnan Reservoir, Nanrunhe Four Female Temple River Reduction Project, and other projects in the Haihe River Basin. At the same time, there are 35 new projects started, such as the Huaihe River Basin's Suzhou Lake Flood Control Project, Youxuhe River Treatment Project, Xuanhe River Treatment Project, Huiji River Treatment Project, Yinghe Sluice Gate Project, and Erhe Sluice Gate Project; the Yishu, Shu, Wenshu, and Sishui River Basins' Zhongyunhe River Treatment Project, Suzhou Sluice Gate, Jiangfengkou Diversion Channel Project; the Liaohe River Basin's Xinlitun Reservoir; the Yellow River's People's Victory Canal Expansion Project, and so on. This year, 21 large water conservancy projects can be completed.

In water conservancy construction, attention must continue to be paid to the overall planning and comprehensive utilization of water conservancy resources, combining flood control, irrigation, navigation, and hydropower generation.

In water treatment, the principle of giving priority to storage and auxiliary drainage should be implemented; in water conservancy projects, the principle of giving priority to small-scale and combining large, medium, and small-scale should be implemented. A large number of small-scale projects should be undertaken by agricultural producers' cooperatives, medium-scale projects should be jointly undertaken by agricultural producers' cooperatives as much as possible, and the state should provide necessary support and assistance, while large-scale projects should be constructed by the state.

The state's investment in land reclamation in 1958 is 235 million yuan, planning for the State Farm Administration to reclaim 7 million mu, plus the state-owned farms, mass reclamation, and immigrant reclamation in various places, the total land reclamation nationwide will reach 177.35 million mu. When reclaiming land in mountainous areas, special attention should be paid to water and soil conservation work.

The state will invest in afforestation of 42.83 million mu in 1958; at the same time, the mass tree-planting movement will be further developed. To achieve the greening requirements of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Outline, various local authorities must make specific plans for forest coverage based on local conditions, seize the time, and speed up the greening work of tree planting. Where four seasons can be planted, all four seasons should be planted; where three seasons can be planted, all three seasons should be planted; where two seasons can be planted, all two seasons should be planted.

The agricultural machinery tractor station plans to add 1,457 tractors in 1958. Many agricultural producers' cooperatives have high enthusiasm for agricultural technological transformation, and their accumulated funds have increased, and they will purchase a large number of new agricultural tools and drainage and irrigation machinery, and so on, to promote the development of agricultural production.

In the basic construction of the transportation industry, the state will invest a total of 2.2 billion yuan in 1958, of which about two-thirds will be used for railway construction.

Title: The 1958 National Economic Plan
Author:
Date: 1958-02-23
Page: 1

The 1958 national economic plan aims to achieve significant growth in various sectors, including railway construction, highway construction, waterway construction, industrial production, agricultural production, and cultural education. The plan also emphasizes the importance of frugality and anti-waste measures, as well as relying on the masses to achieve and surpass the planned targets.

**Railway Construction**

The railway construction plan includes laying approximately 1,500 kilometers of new and double-track lines. Key projects include completing the railway from Baotou to Lanzhou, connecting the Northwest with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and extending the Lanzhou to Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region railway westward by 300 kilometers to reach Hami. The plan also includes completing 2,234 kilometers of railway lines by 1958, which will be the year with the most significant increase in railway operating lines in China.

The plan emphasizes the construction of the Sichuan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Guangxi railways, as well as the preparation for the construction of the Hunan-Guizhou and Yunnan-Guizhou railways. These railways, when completed within three to five years, will connect the southwestern region of China with the rest of the country from the north, east, and south.

**Highway Construction**

The highway construction plan, overseen by the Ministry of Communications, includes 11 major routes, primarily connecting to minority regions in the southwest.

**Waterway Construction**

The waterway construction plan, also overseen by the Ministry of Communications, includes the construction of ports in Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Zhanjiang, Hainan Island, and Yuxikou in Anhui, as well as the addition of 78,000 tons of shipping capacity.

**Industrial and Commercial Construction**

In addition to the above construction projects, the state has also made corresponding arrangements for the construction of warehouses for the commercial sector, urban construction, and the construction of cultural, educational, and health departments, based on the needs of various sectors.

To meet the needs of large-scale development in basic construction in the future, the central and local governments must further strengthen geological surveys, prospecting, and construction and installation work.

The basic construction tasks for 1958 are arduous. Various departments and regions must strengthen their work, accelerate progress, ensure quality, reduce costs, and better complete the plan.

The new leap in the national economy has the potential to exceed planned production increases and generate more fiscal revenue. Therefore, we have prepared a batch of reserve basic construction projects, which will be immediately started when the state's financial and material resources are seen to have surplus capacity.

**Industrial Production**

The 1958 industrial production plan aims to achieve a total industrial output value of 64.37 billion yuan and a total handicraft output value of 10.37 billion yuan.

In the total industrial and handicraft output value, the production of means of production is 35.66 billion yuan, an increase of 18.8% over the previous year; the production of means of consumption is 39.08 billion yuan, an increase of 9.7% over the previous year. The production of means of production continues to grow at a faster rate, while the production of means of consumption is also growing at a faster pace compared to 1957.

In 1958, the production of fuel, electricity, and raw materials will be actively developed to meet the needs of the expanded scale of basic construction, the development of processing industries, and the overall development of the national economy. For example, steel production is planned to reach 6.248 million tons, an increase of 19.2% over 1957. Electricity generation is planned to reach 22.45 billion kWh, an increase of 18% over 1957. Coal production is planned to reach 150.724 million tons, an increase of 17.2% over 1957. The production of timber and cement is also planned to increase by 9.4% and 14.5% respectively over 1957. Only oil production, due to resource and technical constraints, will see a relatively smaller increase, and efforts should be made to exceed the original targets during the implementation of the plan.

The 1958 mechanical industry production plan fully utilizes the equipment capacity of various mechanical industry sectors to better meet the needs of basic construction and agricultural technological transformation. The growth rate of mechanical products such as power generation equipment, electric motors, nitrogen fertilizer production equipment, heavy-duty trucks, and steam locomotives will all reach over 50%, significantly improving China's self-sufficiency in machinery and equipment. Notably, in the "156 projects" construction projects designed with Soviet assistance, the proportion of domestically manufactured equipment will increase from about 42% in 1957 to about 60% in 1958. This will be a significant leap for China's machinery manufacturing industry.

The production of machinery supporting agriculture will grow even faster in 1958. For example, irrigation and drainage machinery will increase by more than twofold over 1957, with 500,000 horsepower available for rural areas in the same year, approximately equal to the total horsepower of all existing agricultural water pumps in the country. This will be another leap for the machinery manufacturing industry.

As a large number of machines are sent to the countryside, a large number of technical personnel, technical workers, and young intellectuals will also go to the countryside, providing significant support for the new high tide of agricultural production.

To meet the urgent needs of agricultural production development, the production of chemical fertilizers in 1958 will see a significant increase. The plan is to produce 9.06 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer and 1.96 million tons of phosphate fertilizer, an increase of 33.7% and 63.9% respectively over the previous year. The production of various pesticides will also see a corresponding increase.

The production of light industrial products in 1958 is arranged based on the possible supply of raw materials and market demand. Due to the bumper harvest of cotton, hemp, and ramie in 1957, and the expansion of sugarcane and sugar beet planting areas, the production of cotton yarn, hemp bags, and sugar in 1958 will all increase by over 10%. The production of aquatic products, machine-made paper, bicycles, and rubber shoes in 1958 will also increase by over 10%. The production of edible oil, flour, and cigarettes will see a slower growth rate due to the smaller increase in raw materials.

The 1958 industrial production plan not only focuses on increasing production but also emphasizes the increase of new products.

The plan stipulates that in 1958, the central departments alone will trial-manufacture 372 important new products, including the following important products: cold-rolled silicon steel sheets, heat-resistant stainless steel for the aviation industry, high-pressure air compressors and synthesis towers for the nitrogen fertilizer industry, complete sets of 50,000 kW thermal power generation equipment, complete sets of 72,500 kW hydroelectric power generation equipment, 220,000-volt high-voltage transformers, 1,501.3 cubic meter blast furnaces, 1,150 mm rolling mills, 54-horsepower caterpillar tractors, 13,000-ton ocean-going cargo ships, television transmitters and receivers, synthetic fibers, etc. When these important new products are successfully trial-manufactured, China's industrial technology level will significantly improve.

Trial-manufacturing new products is an important condition for increasing new products, which is a key to achieving the development of the national economy in terms of quantity, speed, quality, and economy. Various industrial departments and regions must treat this task as an important mission, lead it seriously, take effective measures, mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of scientific and technical personnel and technical workers, strengthen the collection and research of technical information, establish reward systems, organize cooperation among relevant units, and ensure the successful completion of trial-manufacturing tasks.

Trial-manufacturing and producing machinery suitable for use in various rural areas in China, such as power machinery, cultivation machinery, threshing machinery, initial processing machinery for agricultural products, and transportation machinery, is a particularly important task for the machinery manufacturing industry. The machinery industry, local industrial departments, and scientific research institutions should consider the natural conditions of the locality when trial-manufacturing and producing these machines, study and improve the diverse creations of the local masses, and make these products sturdy and lightweight, capable of comprehensive use, and able to utilize local fuels, with affordable prices.

Quality of products must be emphasized. In 1958, we should not only achieve a significant development in the quantity of industrial production but also further improve the quality, significantly increase the proportion of qualified products, and eliminate defective products as much as possible.

Many factories in Shanghai have recently paid special attention to improving product quality and have taken measures to catch up with or surpass the quality of famous industrial products from countries like Britain and the United States within a certain period. This is commendable. We hope that all cities and departments will, based on their own conditions, conduct thorough research and formulate feasible plans and measures for improving the quality of industrial products. The State Science and Technology Commission and scientific research institutions should collect these plans, conduct comprehensive research, and strengthen guidance in this area.

**Agricultural Production**

The 1958 plan aims for a grain production of 392 billion jin and a cotton production of 35 million piculs, as well as other various targets for agricultural and sideline products. These targets are quite ambitious. Given the unprecedented enthusiasm for increased production among the more than 500 million farmers nationwide, these targets can be achieved and even surpassed, provided there are no particularly severe natural disasters.

In 1958, the total cultivated land area nationwide is planned to reach 16.9245 billion mu, an increase of 102.5 million mu over the previous year; the total sown area of crops nationwide is planned to reach 24.148 billion mu, an increase of 689 million mu over the previous year; the total irrigated area nationwide is planned to exceed 6 billion mu.

To prepare for the increased production of grain and cotton, based on the increase in cultivated land, multiple cropping area, and irrigated area, the sown area for various grains in 1958 is planned to be 18.3926 billion mu, an increase of 317.5 million mu over the previous year; the sown area for cotton is planned to be 90.3 million mu, an increase of 41.2 million mu over the previous year.

In 1958, the growth rates for the production of peanuts, rapeseed, flue-cured tobacco, and other crops are set relatively high. For example, peanuts are planned to increase by 20%, rapeseed by 30%, and flue-cured tobacco by 48%. Soybeans are planned to increase by 4.4%. Sugarcane and sugar beets are planned to increase by 27.5% and 29.5% respectively. We have also paid attention to the production of ramie and oak silkworm cocoons, which have significant production potential, with planned production of 14.4 million piculs and 14.57 million piculs respectively, an increase of 32.8% and 58.4% respectively over the previous year.

In 1958, the plan calls for a relatively rapid increase in the number of large livestock such as cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules, with a total increase of 4.6% over the previous year, reaching 88.27 million head, to meet the urgent need for draft animals in agricultural production. Some agricultural cooperatives have adopted measures such as team-based, household-based, and plow-based feeding, combined with breeding and use, strengthened disease prevention work, protected draft animals; some agricultural cooperatives have introduced superior breeds from superior breeding areas to improve breeds, and used various methods to protect female animals and breed draft animals; some agricultural cooperatives have promoted green fodder, established fodder and forage bases, and increased fodder for draft animals. All regions should summarize these good experiences, actively promote them, and strive to complete the plan for increasing draft animals this year.

The plan calls for the pig population to reach 150 million by the end of 1958, to increase meat, fertilizer, and farmers' income.

The plan calls for the afforestation of 65.06 million mu in 1958, and the replanting and tending of 21.9 million mu in logged areas.

The state must have strict regulations: the work of logging must be closely linked with soil and water conservation and afforestation. The forestry industry department, if it violates the above regulations, should be punished.

The implementation of the revised outline of the national agricultural development plan still has ten years, but the key is the first three years. Our slogan is to work hard for three years and strive to fundamentally change the face of agricultural production in most parts of the country within three years. Our method is comprehensive planning, strengthening leadership, mobilizing the masses, and testing everything through experiments.

The main way to increase agricultural production is to improve the yield per unit area. As mentioned earlier, many counties in the country have already achieved the increased production targets for grain and cotton set by the revised outline of the national agricultural development plan ten years ahead of schedule; starting from this year, more counties should achieve the targets set by the outline. Based on their own conditions, within the scope of a province, how many counties can achieve the 1967 targets set by the revised outline of the national agricultural development plan in this year, next year, and subsequent years, should be planned by the province and autonomous region; similarly, within the scope of a county, how many townships can achieve the 1967 targets in this year, next year, and subsequent years, should be planned by the county and township. After the plan is made, the masses should be mobilized, and measures should be taken to ensure its implementation.

Here, it should be mentioned that in the past few years, the production of various industrial raw material crops has been unstable and the growth rate has been relatively slow, which has had an adverse effect on the faster development of light industry production. Starting from this year, specialized conferences should be held for various types of crops, to study effective ways to increase the production and quality of cotton, hemp, ramie, wild hemp, silkworm cocoons, oak silkworm cocoons, soybean, peanut, rapeseed, tea oil, tung oil, sugarcane, sugar beet, tobacco leaf, tea leaf, fruits, and rubber, and to select high-yield typical experiences for promotion. The increase in the production of these industrial raw material crops is important for increasing light industry production, improving people's lives, and accumulating national funds, and all departments and regions should pay close attention to and do a good job in this aspect.

Based on the current situation and natural conditions, the planting areas and planting areas of important industrial raw material crops should be reasonably planned, and new production bases should be gradually established. At the same time, to avoid reducing the planting area of grain, active measures should be taken to open up new avenues, such as utilizing idle land, riverbanks, slopes, and developing mountainous areas, to increase the production of various crops.

**People's Material Life and Domestic and Foreign Trade**

Based on the needs of industrial and agricultural production, basic construction, and the development of various undertakings, the total number of employees included in the national plan in 1958 will reach 24.392 million, an increase of 41.9 million over the previous year. The increase in personnel is mainly graduates from universities, secondary specialized schools, technical schools, and technical training classes, as well as some demobilized personnel. Among the total number of employees this year, a considerable number of personnel will be sent to rural areas and production units in factories and mines for labor training.

The total wage bill for employees in 1958 is planned to be 15.8 billion yuan, an increase of 550 million yuan over the previous year. Of the increased wage bill, approximately 3 billion yuan will be used for the wages of newly added employees, and approximately 2.5 billion yuan will be used for the partial upgrading and adjustment of certain unreasonable wage standards for existing employees.

The total supply of commodities to society in 1958 can reach 50 billion yuan, an increase of 3 billion yuan over the previous year, a growth of 6.5%.

Based on the above arrangements for labor wages and commodity supply, the estimated purchasing power of society in 1958 is approximately 49.4 billion yuan. The purchasing power of agricultural cooperatives and rural residents will increase by approximately 2.2 billion yuan over the previous year, and the purchasing power of urban residents will increase by approximately 500 million yuan; institutions, organizations, enterprises, schools, and the military will reduce their purchasing power by more than 3 billion yuan due to the reduction of public expenses. The three increases and decreases offset each other, resulting in a net increase of 2.4 billion yuan.

The supply of social commodities exceeds social purchasing power, not only ensuring the stability of the market and prices but also allowing the commercial sector to retain a certain amount of reserve capacity.

In 1958, the supply of major commodities to meet social needs, except for grain, will all increase. For example, pork will increase by approximately 620 million jin, aquatic products will increase by approximately 482 million jin, cotton cloth will increase by approximately 57.8 million bolts, wool will increase by approximately 6.6 million meters, wool yarn will increase by approximately 2 million jin, coal will increase by approximately 77 million tons, and daily necessities will increase by approximately 200 million yuan. However, due to the relatively fast population growth, the per capita supply of some commodities, such as cotton cloth, will only be maintained at the 1957 level. The supply of grain will decrease slightly compared to the previous year, mainly because grain production has increased year by year, and a considerable number of grain-deficient households in rural areas that previously relied on state supply are now able to be self-sufficient and no longer need state supply.

In commercial work, the first thing to pay attention to is to ensure the timely supply of production materials to rural areas; secondly, it is necessary to do a good job in the procurement of agricultural products and the procurement of usable wild plants and waste materials.

In foreign trade, in response to the development needs of China's industrial and agricultural production, the total import and export trade volume in 1958 is planned to be 11 billion yuan, an increase of 8.6% over the previous year.

Ensuring the import of necessary materials is an important condition for completing the 1958 national economic plan. To complete the import plan, the foreign trade department should work closely with relevant departments to organize export sources and expand foreign exchange earnings. China has abundant resources for export, and we must fully mobilize the enthusiasm of governments and economic departments at all levels, tap potential in all aspects, actively organize production, improve quality, strengthen procurement work, and do a good job in the trial marketing of new products to strive to complete and overfulfill the import and export plan.

**Culture and Education**

In 1958, the number of students enrolled in schools established by the state will be: 109,000 in higher education institutions, 153,000 in secondary specialized schools, 2,076,000 in regular high schools, and 20,170,000 in primary schools. The number of students enrolled in schools established by the masses is estimated to be approximately: 10,000 in senior high schools, 180,000 in junior high schools, and 2,560,000 in primary schools. Cultural and health undertakings will also see further development compared to the previous year.

In the field of culture and education, it is necessary to continue to strengthen political and ideological leadership. We should, based on the principle of combining mental and manual labor, further improve our education system; adapt to the high tide of socialist construction, further improve the quality of various cultural and educational work; and, based on the principles of frugal school management, frugal management of cultural and health undertakings, and relying on the masses to establish schools, actively develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings. To achieve these goals, the following measures will be taken in 1958.

1. Gradually implement the semi-work, semi-study education system. Secondary and higher education institutions that have the conditions to independently or jointly establish experimental factories, experimental farms, and experimental ranches can independently or jointly establish them, engaging in teaching on the one hand and production labor on the other; those that cannot establish them can sign production internship contracts with local factories, workshops, and service industries to engage in internships, or participate in local regular voluntary labor and agricultural cooperative labor, combining study with labor. Industrial schools should, like the Xi'an First Aviation Technical School, gradually establish affiliated factories or participate in related factory labor. Agricultural schools, whether secondary or higher, should gradually sign contracts with local agricultural cooperatives, regularly sending students and teachers to agricultural cooperatives to engage in labor, help agricultural cooperatives with technological reforms, and, as far as possible, enroll a portion of students recommended by agricultural cooperatives to study in schools. Schools with the conditions to establish affiliated production units should strive to achieve self-sufficiency, semi-self-sufficiency, or partial self-sufficiency in school funds within a certain period to achieve the development of China's education sector in terms of quantity, speed, quality, and economy.

2. In the new students enrolled in higher education institutions, the proportion of workers and peasants should be increased as much as possible. Students, after graduation, should generally participate in a certain period of production labor.

3. Secondary specialized schools mainly cultivate workers and peasants with culture and technology. Students, after graduation, should all participate in industrial and agricultural production. In the future, the technical and managerial cadres needed by the state should be promoted as much as possible from workers and peasants who meet the conditions. Various departments' secondary specialized schools in various places should accept the unified leadership of local party and government.

4. Workers' and peasants' accelerated middle schools are planned to be changed into preparatory classes or regular workers' and peasants' middle schools for universities, continuing to enroll students in the fall of 1958, attracting excellent workers, peasants, and workers' and peasants' cadres who have completed a certain period of labor and have completed junior high school or primary school education to study.

5. Extensively establish evening schools to provide cultural education from primary school level to high school level, or technical education from general knowledge to secondary level, attracting adult workers to study culture and technology. At the same time, actively establish evening higher education.

6. Continue to develop mass-run schools. The curriculum arrangement and educational progress of schools run by the masses can be decided based on the opinions of the masses and the specific situation of the locality, with various forms and different lengths of study time. Various levels of educational departments should provide active help and guidance.

7. To ensure the basic elimination of illiteracy among youth and adults within the next ten years, it is necessary to vigorously promote the campaign to eliminate illiteracy.

8. Vigorous promotion of the patriotic health campaign centered on the eradication of the "four pests," formulating and gradually implementing specific plans for the eradication of the "four pests" and major diseases.

9. Under the guidance of the state, actively promote mass cultural and sports activities.

10. In various levels of schools and cultural units, part of the miscellaneous labor and some construction projects, such as cleaning, repairing playgrounds and roads, and building houses, should be planned and organized by teachers and students to do it themselves.

Regarding scientific research work, it is not intended to elaborate here. The current important issue is how scientific and technological research work can adapt to the great development of industrial and agricultural production and construction, continuously supporting the technological transformation of industry and agriculture with research results. All national scientific research institutions, including administrative departments and higher education institutions, must continue and, as far as possible, expand their close contact with relevant production and construction units, sign cooperation contracts, help solve problems raised in production and construction, and pay attention to the study and summary of inventions, creations, and rationalization suggestions from workers and staff.

The Chinese delegation led by Guo Moruo, visiting the Soviet Union, signed an agreement on joint scientific and technological research and Soviet assistance to China in major scientific and technological research with the Soviet government in Moscow on January 18 of this year, and agreed on 122 major cooperation projects. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Ministry of Higher Education and the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education, and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences have also signed agreements and cooperation projects respectively. The comprehensive cooperation between the two countries in science and technology is of great significance for promoting the rapid development of China's science and technology. Chinese scientific and technological personnel must fully mobilize their enthusiasm and creativity to fully implement these agreements, complete these cooperative scientific and technological research projects on time, and make China's science and technology catch up with the world's advanced level in many important aspects.

**Practice Frugality and Oppose Waste**

Since the liberation of the entire country, we have repeatedly carried out production and frugality campaigns, achieving significant results in reducing military and political expenses, lowering construction costs, saving non-production investment, saving raw materials, and reducing production costs. However, it should be noted that there is still a lot of waste in various departments, regions, and units, and there is serious waste, and there is still a lot of room for saving.

The following are some facts.

In the basic construction of factories, mines, and transportation enterprises, due to our lack of experience, a considerable amount of funds have been used improperly, that is, there is a lot of waste. Many of our comrades do not distinguish between key enterprises and general enterprises, between main workshops and auxiliary workshops, between main equipment and auxiliary equipment, and pursue high standards, mechanization, and automation uniformly, making enterprises that can be built with less money and in a shorter time with more money and time. For example, a sugar factory in Jilin Province has a high design standard and degree of mechanization, costing 270 million yuan and taking more than three years to complete and start production; while another sugar factory in Heilongjiang Province with the same production capacity, due to a lower design standard and degree of mechanization, only cost 60% of the Jilin sugar factory and took much less time to build. This situation is difficult to completely avoid in the early stages of construction. Now, we have more than five years of construction experience, so it is possible and necessary to build more enterprises with the same amount of investment. According to many investigations, under the general condition of ensuring engineering quality, it is now possible to use 60, 70, or 80 yuan to do what used to require 100 yuan. Some enterprises can even be well built with only half or less of the original money.

In addition to the waste in production construction, there is also waste in non-production construction. Since 1955, through the work of lowering construction standards and reducing construction projects, the proportion of non-production construction investment in the total construction investment has been reduced from more than 30% to about 20%. This is a good achievement. However, calculated based on the total investment during the First Five-Year Plan period, the proportion of non-production construction investment is still 23.4%; the total non-production housing construction area reaches 160 million square meters, roughly equivalent to six times the total housing area of Beijing before liberation, with an investment of 11 billion yuan. This figure is obviously too large. Now, many workers still do not understand that excessive, good, and early non-production construction cannot promote production but only hinder production, so many places still have the phenomenon of too many and too high standards of non-production construction projects. If these phenomena are corrected, a lot of funds can be saved to expand production construction investment.

In addition to the waste in production construction and non-production construction, there are still many serious waste phenomena in many industrial, commercial, and transportation enterprises. For example, material accumulation, material waste, excessive defective and substandard products, capital accumulation, too many business links, too many management personnel, poor warehouse management, etc. In terms of material accumulation, taking steel as an example, if the inventory is appropriately reduced and various methods are used to save and use it, the turnover amount of steel in production enterprises and basic construction units can be reduced by about one-third.

It should be pointed out that in many of our organs, troops, schools, and public institutions, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste is still quite common, and there are many inappropriate places in the expenditure of public funds. There is still a lot of room for saving personnel and funds.

All the above shortcomings must be corrected resolutely. In 1958, we must continue to fight for frugality and oppose waste, regarding this fight as a major task for the development of the national economy.

We plan to take the following main measures.

1. Revise the relevant systems of basic construction work, formulate design specifications for various types of enterprises suitable for China's current economic conditions, and construction cost standards for civil buildings to ensure the further implementation of the policy of frugal construction. Newly started construction projects above the limit in 1958 must have design documents approved by the relevant authorities before construction can begin. Projects planned for 1959 should start design work in advance from now on. In the future, except for some special projects that can be designed and constructed simultaneously with the approval of the State Council, projects without design documents will not be included in the annual plan. Continue to review and revise the design documents of important enterprises and important projects, reduce unnecessary construction projects, and lower inappropriate and excessively high standards. For the entire basic construction, it is required to save 7% to 10% of the total investment this year to expand the workload.

2. All economic departments and all enterprises must strengthen economic accounting work, improve the material supply system, establish necessary supply bases, and ensure that the raw materials needed by enterprises can be supplied in a timely manner. Re-examine the working capital of industrial and commercial enterprises. Production enterprises must, on the basis of improving quality, complete the task of reducing costs in excess. Commercial enterprises must complete the task of reducing circulation costs in excess. To this end, business links should be reduced, a large number of personnel should be reduced, and surplus employees should be sent to participate in labor production.

3. Thoroughly clean up the warehouses of industrial, commercial, transportation, construction, and installation enterprises, greatly reduce the inventory of production materials in enterprises, and use them to expand production and basic construction. All basic construction units' stored equipment that needs and can be installed should be installed; equipment that is not needed should be transferred to units in need by the competent department for adjustment. In this way, the scale of basic construction can be expanded without increasing state financial allocations. At the same time, the main material consumption quotas and inventory quotas of production enterprises and basic construction enterprises should be re-examined and the warehouse management system should be improved to reduce material losses and accidents. During the warehouse cleanup, all departments and units should report the truth and not conceal or underreport; otherwise, they should be criticized and punished.

4. Reasonably organize labor and save labor. The number of employees in the current enterprises in China is generally too many. The solution to this problem, in addition to not increasing workers in existing enterprises as much as possible, is that newly started enterprises should gradually increase workers according to the high and low of the opening rate and not recruit workers too early and too many. Units that plan to increase workers should be adjusted from surplus workers in the locality; when it is not possible to adjust in the locality, generally only temporary workers can be recruited nearby. For existing surplus workers, in addition to expanding the original enterprise as much as possible under possible conditions to make the number of workers correspond to the workload, it is also possible to consider, under the condition of guaranteeing the original income of workers, through discussion and persuasion, adjusting a portion of surplus workers in some departments to departments with insufficient manpower. For example, surplus workers in industrial and transportation departments can be transferred to farm work; or some formal workers can be changed to temporary work, etc. In this way, there is no loss to individual workers; for the state, it can increase production and wealth, which is beneficial to both the public and the private. Existing and newly established enterprises and public institutions should adopt various forms to utilize the surplus labor and semi-labor of urban and rural residents to engage in agency sales, agency purchases, agency services, etc., to reduce the number of formal employees as much as possible.

Currently, the staff and workers of all organs, organizations, troops, enterprises, public institutions, and cooperatives across the country are carrying out the anti-waste campaign. In this campaign, many waste-saving methods have been created. The relevant departments should, through the discussion of the masses, solidify those good methods into systems and implement them.

Chairman Mao said: "We must make all cadres and the entire people always think that our country is a socialist great power, but it is also a poor country with a backward economy. This is a great contradiction. To make our country rich and strong, we need decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of the policy of frugal construction and opposing waste."

Currently, the rectification movement is being carried out nationwide, which is a good opportunity to practice frugality and oppose waste. Every unit must implement Chairman Mao's above instructions, regard the practice of frugality and opposing waste as an important topic in the rectification movement, and carry out extensive discussion, rectification, and reform, and launch an anti-waste campaign across the country, so that the flames of the masses' production and frugality can spread to every corner of the country, thoroughly rectify the rightist conservative thoughts of the leadership of various departments, regions, and units on the practice of frugality and opposing waste, thoroughly expose and resolutely rectify various waste phenomena, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the anti-waste struggle.

**Relying on the Masses to Achieve and Surpass the 1958 National Economic Plan**

After the 1958 national economic plan is discussed and approved by the conference, it will be implemented nationwide in various places, enterprises, schools, and public institutions. As mentioned earlier, this plan can not only be completed but also has the possibility of being surpassed. Whether this possibility can be realized depends on whether the leadership can unite with the masses and what attitude and methods the leadership organizations at all levels adopt.

Is it to stand at the forefront of the movement, fully rely on the masses, mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to complete and surpass the plan? Or is it to fall behind the development of the situation, fall behind the demands of the masses, emphasize difficult conditions, emphasize negative factors, and set the plan for one's own department or unit low, leading a relatively relaxed life? Is it to hand over the plan of one's own department or unit to the masses for discussion, inspire the wisdom of the masses, concentrate the opinions of the masses, and revise and supplement it to make it a more active and more mobilizing plan? Or is it to rely on a few people to compile the plan in the office, using only administrative orders to implement it, making the plan unable to unite with the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and becoming a lifeless official document?

Our party and the people's government have always emphasized the mass line when doing various work. For matters like compiling and implementing the national economic plan, which are related to the interests of tens of millions of people and the interests of the 600 million people in the country, if the masses are not widely mobilized and organized to do it, it is impossible to formulate an economic plan that is close to reality and truly advanced; even if it is formulated, it is impossible to implement it well. But if the masses are seriously mobilized, and the plan is turned into a truly conscious plan of the masses, it will certainly be a completely different matter.

The new high tide of industrial and agricultural production that began last autumn further proves that all economic plans, after being discussed by the masses and consciously implemented by the masses, many originally considered advanced indicators have become backward indicators; many long-standing problems have been quickly solved; many things that were originally thought to require a lot of money to do have been done with very little money; many good methods that were originally not thought of have been thought of by the masses; many potential forces that have not been tapped have been continuously tapped. For example, the daily output of the Agang Town Coal Mine in Gansu Province was originally stuck between 600 tons and 850 tons, unable to increase, but after the rectification movement, extensive discussion, rectification, and reform, the daily output has now reached more than 1,200 tons and is striving for a daily output of 1,500 tons. The attendance rate of the Wuhan Vehicle Factory was originally unable to be improved in the first half of 1957, but after the mass discussion and rectification, it reached 99% by November of last year. The basic construction units in Liaoning Province, after the mass rectification work, have produced a large number of advanced units and advanced workers who are good at production, good at quality, good at safety, good at discipline, good at attendance, and good at unity. In the discussion of this year's plan draft, there are also many such moving examples. Take the Beijing Jixi Mining Bureau as an example. The original coal production target set by the State Economic Commission and the Ministry of Coal Industry for them was 28.5 million tons, an increase of 21% over the previous year, which was already considered quite advanced, but after the discussion by the masses, it was increased to 30.5 million tons, an increase of more than 10% over the original target, and the workers also proposed to produce an additional 15 million tons of coal as a struggle target. In agriculture, as mentioned earlier, the rapid development of the national agricultural water conservancy construction movement is a very prominent example; recently, many such facts have been continuously reported in newspapers, and here they will not be repeated. There is no doubt that as long as all grassroots units can be like the above units, like all advanced agricultural cooperatives, strive bravely, tap potential, and hand over the indicators of increasing production, improving quality, reducing costs, and improving labor productivity to the masses for thorough and serious discussion, and combine the national plan with the conscious action of the masses, and combine the national plan that must be completed with the increased production plan proposed by the masses after discussion, surpassing the national plan will have a reliable guarantee.

In the process of handing over the plan to the masses for discussion and organizing the masses to implement it, many advanced units and advanced individuals will inevitably emerge. The responsibility of economic workers, especially economic leaders, is to always pay attention to the discovery of advanced things, seriously summarize and promote advanced experience, adopt the method of "grasping both the advanced and the backward to bring the middle forward," and help the backward units to catch up with the advanced, and make the advanced units more advanced. In this way, new imbalances may occur in various sectors of the national economy. This new imbalance driven by advanced units is a good phenomenon that promotes economic development. Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "So-called balance is the temporary and relative unity of contradictions. After a year, in general, this balance is broken by the struggle of contradictions, and this unity changes, balance becomes imbalance, unity becomes non-unity, and a new balance and unity need to be made for the next year, which is the superiority of our planned economy. In fact, every month and every quarter, this balance and unity are partially broken locally and need to be adjusted locally." Therefore, in the process of economic development, from balance to imbalance, and then to a new balance, this spiral repetition and continuous advance is a normal phenomenon. When the phenomenon of imbalance appears, there are two different ways to handle it: one is an active way, to be happy about new things, promote their growth, rely on the strength of the masses to timely eliminate weak links, and make the economic development reach a new and higher level. The other is a passive way, to ignore new things, to have no enthusiasm, to be afraid of the phenomenon of imbalance, not to strive to push the backward to the advanced, but to try to let the advanced accommodate the backward. The difference between these two methods is the difference between promoters and retarders as mentioned by Chairman Mao.

Our economic workers should be promoters of socialist construction, not retarders, and not maintainers of the status quo. We have used the spirit of moving mountains with spades to win the victory of the revolution, and we will use the same spirit to win the victory of socialist construction. Therefore, we must seriously implement the policy of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao of uniting the leadership with the masses, "from the masses, to the masses," eliminate bureaucratism, eliminate bureaucratic tendencies, eliminate sectarianism, eliminate subjectivism, and rely on the organization of the Party, the organization of the masses, and the organization of local governments at all levels to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses.

In the great high tide of socialist construction, we are full of confidence, resolutely implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on "more, faster, better, and cheaper," and strive to complete and surpass the 1958 national economic plan!

    关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告
    一九五八年二月三日在第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议上
    国务院副总理兼国家经济委员会主任  薄一波各位代表：
    我代表国务院向第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议，提出关于一九五八年度国民经济计划（草案）的报告，请予审议。
    （一）一九五七年经济战线上的胜利
    一九五七年是我国在各个战线上取得伟大胜利的一年。经过整风运动和反右派斗争，我们在政治战线和思想战线上取得了伟大胜利，这个胜利，促进了经济战线上的胜利；经济战线上的胜利，又进一步地巩固了政治战线和思想战线上的胜利。
    一九五七年各个战线上大胜利的结果是：进一步地巩固了全国人民在工人阶级领导下的团结，巩固了社会主义的政治制度和经济制度，并且由于第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成，增强了社会主义制度的物质基础。回顾一九五七年，就会使每个人对于我们伟大的未来充满信心，充满希望。
    过去的一年中，我国在各个战线上取得的伟大胜利，最基本的推动力量是中共中央和毛主席倡导的全民性的整风运动，以及在这个运动中所进行的反对资产阶级右派的斗争。整风运动和反右派斗争，是政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，是一九五五年和一九五六年经济战线上（生产资料所有制方面）的社会主义革命的继续。
    整风运动的本来的目的，是要消除国家机关内部和共产党内部的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义等不良作风，提高思想，改进工作，以迎接今后更加重大的社会主义建设的任务，加快社会主义建设的进程。但是，在群众性的“大鸣大放”的过程中，资产阶级右派竟然利令智昏，乘机向中国共产党和社会主义制度发动了极为猖狂的进攻，企图在我国复辟资本主义。与右派的愿望相反，他们的这种进攻，引起了全国广大人民群众的极大义愤，使他们自己立即处于完全孤立的地位。为了保卫党和社会主义制度，广大人民群众在党的领导下，开展了声势浩大的反右派的斗争，取得了全盘的胜利。经过这个斗争，经过关于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的全民大辩论，也就形成了全民性的整风运动，大大地提高了广大干部和广大人民群众的社会主义觉悟，提高了劳动积极性，促进了各项建设事业的发展，促进了各种工作的改善。整风运动还没有结束，目前已经进到以整改为主的阶段，不久以后，将要进入各人学习文件、批评反省、提高思想的阶段，但是，人们都已经感到它所发生的巨大作用和它将要发生的更深远的影响。
    现在来说我国一九五七年度国民经济计划的执行结果。
    先说工业战线上的情况。
    根据预计数字（实际完成的统计数字，要在以后才能作出），一九五七年国民经济各部门基本建设总投资额完成了一百二十三亿七千万元，比原定的年度计划大大地超过了。一九五三年到一九五七年五年基本建设总投资额累计完成四百八十七亿七千七百万元，超过第一个五年计划总投资额百分之十四点一。
    一九五七年工业投资额完成六十五亿五千万元，超过原定的年度计划百分之四点一。这一年继续施工和开始施工的限额以上的工矿企业共有六百四十二个，建设完工的限额以上的工矿企业共有一百七十八个，这是第一个五年计划期间重大企业建成最多的一年，全年平均，差不多每两天就有一个重大企业建设完工。在这些建设完工的企业中，属于苏联帮助设计的“一百五十六项”的有二十二个。重要的有：本溪钢铁公司，黑龙江钢厂，吉林肥料厂，吉林电石厂，哈尔滨锅炉厂，西安电力电容器厂，太原第一热电站，佳木斯造纸厂，等等。此外，还有国内设计的沈阳重型机器厂，四川狮子滩水电站，改建的安东人造纤维厂等。由于这些重大企业的建成和投入生产，我国就可以提高优质钢和合金钢的自给率，就增加了一个现代化的、综合性的化学工业基地，就能够自己制造火力发电设备所需要的锅炉和目前所缺乏的某些重型机器，就能够大量生产工业用纸。
    一九五七年新增加的工业生产能力（按年产量计算），仅中央各部所属的企业就有：采煤一千四百八十九万吨，发电量三十二亿五千万度，生铁八十一万吨，钢材四十八万五千吨，水泥一百零五万吨，棉纱五十二万件，机制纸七万七千吨。
    一九五七年的工业总产值（不包括手工业产值，下同），包括原有企业和新建企业的在内，预计达到六百二十八亿一千万元（按一九五二年不变价格计算），超过年度计划百分之四点一，比上一年增长百分之六点九，超过第一个五年计划所规定的一九五七年的指标百分之十七点三。主要工业产品也绝大多数超额完成了产量计划，比上一年，原煤增产了一千八百二十六万吨，电力增产了二十四亿度，生铁增产了一百零八万吨，钢增产了约七十八万吨，机床增产了三千一百多台，化学肥料增产了十四万吨，水泥增产了将近三十万吨，木材增产了约五百二十万立方公尺。
    从一九五七年的第四季度以来，全国各企业经过“鸣放”高潮和社会主义教育，工人阶级作为国家领导阶级的责任感大大增强，政治积极性和增产节约的积极性空前高涨，使工人运动进入了一个新的阶段。在职工内部，分清了是非，发扬了正气，打击了邪气，孤立了坏人，积极分子大量增加。广大职工群众不仅对国家建设、企业管理、干部作风和生活福利等方面揭露了很多缺点，提出了改进意见，而且很快地提高了出勤率，加强了劳动纪律，突破了很多定额，改进了经营管理，使许多企业和基本建设单位的面貌为之一新，使工业战线上形成了一个生产和建设的新高潮。
    以下再说农业战线上的情况。
    根据预计，一九五七年比一九五六年，粮食增加了五十亿斤，达到三千七百亿斤；棉花增加了约三百九十万担，达到三千二百八十万担；甘蔗增加了三千零九十二万担，甜菜增加了约三百九十万担，黄麻、洋麻增加了约一百万担，猪的饲养头数增加了约三千万头。农业和农副业总产值达到六百零三亿五千万元（按一九五二年不变价格计算），比一九五六年增长百分之三点五。由于部分地区的水灾较为严重，部分地区在入秋以后的旱灾又较普遍，农业和农副业总产值只完成年度计划的百分之九十八点七，但是还超过了第一个五年计划所规定的一九五七年的指标百分之一点二。
    在一九五七年，全国已经有六十五个县、市，分别达到了全国农业发展纲要修正草案所提出的每亩生产粮食四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的要求，已经有五十六个县、市，分别达到了每亩生产棉花（皮棉）六十斤、八十斤、一百斤的要求，即提前十年完成了全国农业发展纲要修正草案所规定的任务。而广东省的澄海、潮安、揭阳、潮阳、普宁、南澳，福建省的龙溪、海澄、长乐，湖北省的孝感，四川省的郫县等十一个县，粮食的每亩平均产量已经达到或者超过了一千斤。湖北省的麻城、广济，浙江省的慈谿，甘肃省的敦煌，河北省的石家庄等五个县、市，棉花的每亩平均产量已经达到一百斤以上。根据十六个省、市三十四万多个农业生产合作社的统计，已经有四分之一的合作社的生产和收入，超过了当地富裕中农的水平。
    在一九五七年入秋以后，全国农村经过两条道路的大辩论和社会主义教育，击破了地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子对于合作化的诬蔑和进攻，批判了一部分富裕中农在两条道路之间的动摇和资本主义的自发倾向，坚定了广大农民走社会主义道路的决心，改进了合作社的经营管理，执行了中央关于合作社干部必须参加生产劳动的指示，调整了合作社的内部关系，争取了更多的个体农民加入合作社，从而进一步地巩固了农业的合作化制度和农村的社会主义秩序。
    全国农业发展纲要修正草案的公布，中共中央和国务院关于兴修农田水利和积肥运动的决定的发布，进一步地鼓舞了农民群众的生产积极性，在全国范围内，掀起了一个比一九五五年冬和一九五六年春规模更大的新的农业生产高潮，特别是兴修水利和增积肥料的高潮。目前全国每天有近一亿劳动力参加农田水利的建设。原定一九五七年十月到一九五八年九月底增加灌溉面积九千二百多万亩，但是到一九五八年一月三十一日，已经完成一亿一千七百多万亩，即用四个月的时间超额完成了全年度的任务。拿安徽省作为例子来说，这个省原定去冬今春兴修八亿土方的农田水利工程，后来增加到十六亿土方，但是，到一九五八年一月二十三日就已经完成十六亿多土方。其他各省农民的许多英雄事例，这里就不一一列举了。所有的事实，充分地显示了已经组织起来的农民，在争取农业大发展中，有着多么坚强的信心和无穷无尽的力量！有了这种力量，今年增加灌溉面积的计划以及其他农田水利基本建设的计划，就可以大大地超额完成。
    以下我们还要说到交通运输和商业战线上的情况。
    一九五七年建设铁路新线和复线共计一千一百多公里，举世瞩目的长江大桥、宝成铁路和鹰厦铁路这样的巨大工程，已经建设完成。此外，企业专用线铺轨五百一十六公里（仅是铁道部负责修建的部分）。由于长江大桥的建成，已经把京汉和粤汉两大铁路干线连结起来，实现了我国人民长期以来跨过长江的愿望。由于宝成铁路的通车，已经把物产丰富的四川同全国的铁路网连结起来，克服了我国诗人李白所说的“蜀道之难，难于上青天”的困难。由于鹰厦铁路的建成，进一步地巩固了东南沿海地区的国防，密切了这些地区同全国的经济联系。同时，铁路、公路、内河、沿海等运输计划，也都超额完成。比一九五六年，铁路货物周转量增长百分之十一点八，公路汽车货物周转量增长百分之八点四，交通部直属的内河和沿海运输企业的货物周转量分别增长百分之二十一点四和百分之二十九点二。
    商业方面：一九五七年社会商品零售总额，比上一年增加五亿元，商业部门零售商品的库存到年末比年初增加二十亿元以上。由于增产节约的开展，商品供应不足的情况已经基本改变，物价继续保持稳定，棉花和其它农产品的收购任务，也良好地完成了。粮食的收购数量，也超过了上一年同期的水平，但是，还要作很大的努力，才能完成全年度的收购任务。
    在对外贸易方面，一九五七年进出口贸易总额，比原计划超过百分之四。
    最后说到文教战线上的情况。
    一九五七年的在校学生人数，比一九五六年，高等学校增长百分之九点七，普通中学增长百分之十五，小学增长百分之五点五。群众办学在一九五七年也有了很大的发展，在这方面成绩最多的有四川、江苏、河南、河北等省。卫生部系统的医院病床数，比上一年增长百分之十一点七。文化出版事业，也有所发展。
    在高等学校和其他知识界，经过整风运动和反右派斗争，批判了资产阶级思想，提高了知识分子自我改造的觉悟，许多处在中间状态的知识分子进一步地靠拢了工人阶级和共产党；知识分子参加劳动生产，接受劳动锻炼，已经开始成为风气。同时，党和国家从各方面调配了干部，加强了对于文教工作的领导。
    总的看来，我国国民经济计划经过过去几年来全国人民的努力，特别是一九五六年的大发展、大跃进，全面地完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的形势，就已经形成。经过一九五七年的国民经济的顺利发展，我国第一个五年计划所规定的基本任务和各项主要指标，就全面地完成和超额完成了。
    从全国解放以来，我国经济是高速度地向前发展的。但是，我国经济的发展道路并不是完全平坦的，是有一些曲折的，是在不断克服困难的过程中前进的。在过去的八年中，我们曾经不只一次地遇到了严重的自然灾害给予我们的困难，也不只一次地遇到了物资、财政和技术力量不足给予我们的困难，但是这些困难，都一个一个地被我们克服了。这是因为中共中央和毛主席不仅向人民群众指出困难在哪里，而且善于领导人民群众信心百倍地去同困难作斗争。
    资产阶级右派分子在一九五七年春天，当我国经济发展遇到了一些在前进中的暂时的困难的时候，他们公开否认我们的成绩是主要的，把我国的国家制度、国家政策、经济建设和文化建设说得一无是处。右派分子的这种反共、反人民、反社会主义的恶意攻击，在人民的面前，在事实的面前，已经彻头彻尾地破产了。
    应当说明：在一九五六年冬，由于某些生产资料和生活资料的供应情况比较紧张，曾经有过一些暂时的、局部的困难。如李先念副总理在关于国家预算的报告中所说，我们对于当时财经工作中的某些个别问题曾经有过一些不适当的估计。但是党中央和毛主席随即给我们指出了正确的方向。经过一九五七年的增产和节约，经过整风运动和反右派斗争动员起来的群众积极性的发挥，到了夏季以后，那些局部的困难就逐渐克服了，并且促进了国民经济的发展。一九五七年重工业部门生产的产品，不仅供应了生产、建设部门的需要，而且还增加了各工业部门的库存，补充了国家的储备。农业和轻工业部门所生产的粮食、布匹和其他日用品，基本上保证了市场的供应，并且补充了一九五六年动用的一部分库存。财政收支不仅取得了平衡，而且有所结余。这个促进国民经济发展和克服困难的过程，证明了我国社会主义经济的巨大优越性，证明了我国人民在共产党和毛主席领导下的无坚不摧的力量。
    （二）争取一九五八年国民经济的新跃进
    一九五八年是我国第二个五年计划的第一年。这一年发展国民经济的主要任务，是以很大的力量从各方面来促进农业生产的高潮，争取农业大丰收；积极地发展重工业，主要是增加燃料、电力、原材料、化学肥料、重型机械、农业动力机械和电力设备的产量；按照物力、财力的可能，尽可能地扩大基本建设的投资，主要是生产性建设的投资；努力增加生活资料的生产，继续巩固市场物价的稳定，在扩大再生产的基础上，适当地改善人民的物质生活；积极地发展文化、教育、卫生等项事业。
    我们应当努力争取一九五八年的国民经济发展有一个新的跃进，为第二个五年计划创造一个好的开端。
    有没有可能使一九五八年的国民经济有一个跃进的发展呢？我们的回答是肯定的。整风运动和反右派斗争的伟大胜利给了我们这种有利条件，我国第一个五年计划的巨大成就又给了我们这种有利条件，国家行政管理体制和各项工作的改进也给了我们这种有利条件。只要我们善于利用各种有利的条件，把党中央和毛主席所提出的在十五年或者更多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的号召，变为全国人民的实际行动，调动一切积极的因素，贯彻执行在优先发展重工业的基础上、发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，我们就一定能够在新的阶段上又多、又快、又好、又省地扩大基本建设，发展工业农业生产和各项事业。
    整风运动、反右派斗争和社会主义教育运动的普遍开展，给我们创造的有利条件是这样：人民民主专政的政治制度的进一步巩固，全国工人、农民、知识分子、各民族、各民主党派、工商界人士和其他爱国人士团结的进一步加强，全国人民社会主义觉悟的进一步提高，在最广泛的人民群众和干部中，积极的前进的思想占了上风，消极的因循保守的思想被压倒。毫无疑义，由整风运动而出现的空前提高的社会主义干劲，将在长时期中起作用。特别是目前的农业生产和建设的高潮，必将促进工业生产的新高潮。
    第一个五年计划的成就给我们创造的有利条件是这样：除了在所有制方面三大改造的伟大胜利以外，经过全国人民的积极努力，在苏联的兄弟般的援助下，许多过去没有的新工业部门建立起来了，工业生产能力也迅速地增长起来了。除了一些重型的和精密的设备还不能制造以外，我们已经能够用自己制造的许多设备，来建设自己所需要的大多数重工业企业和绝大多数轻工业企业；已经能够用自己制造的许多机器，来逐步地装备本国的农业部门、运输部门，并且加强国防力量；已经能够用自己生产的金属和其它原材料，来供应我国建设事业的大部分需要。在设计工作方面，除了某些特大的、技术最新的和特别复杂的工程，还不能设计以外，我们也已经开始能够自己设计和建设一些大型的、技术比较复杂的工程，例如，年产一百五十万吨的钢铁联合企业，年产一百五十万吨的煤矿，年产五万吨合成氨的氮肥厂，设备容量一百万瓩左右的水电站，四十万瓩的火电站，多种类型的机器制造厂和年产十万吨的造纸厂，等等。由于我们有了这样的工业化的初步基础，我国今后的基本建设也就能够进行得更多、更快、更好、更省了。
    经过第一个五年计划的实践，我们在工业、农业、交通运输、商业、城市建设等方面的工作，都取得了不少的经验，初步地学会了许多过去完全不会办的事情，能够比过去用更少的钱办更多的事情。我们在运用苏联和其它兄弟国家的先进经验方面，有了一定的进步。
    行政管理体制的改进，一方面，使各地方和各民族地区能够更积极地利用当地的人力、物力、财力和资源，发掘地方的各种潜力，来发展农业和工业，特别是为农业服务的工业，以及其它生产事业。另一方面，把许多适宜于地方举办的事业，划给地方办理，就可以使中央更加集中力量，来进行重点建设、技术改造和工作检查，而促进整个国民经济的发展。
    事实上，当前的有利条件还不止这一些，各个方面的积极因素，还多得很，例如，库存物资和财政结余的增加，军政费和各项事业费的节减，反浪费斗争的深入，建筑造价的降低，等等。而且，我们还必须化一切消极的因素为积极的因素。在我们遇到的困难中，本身也包含着克服困难的因素在内。
    在这里，还必须特别指出国际方面的有利形势。一九五七年苏联发射两颗人造卫星，和六十几个国家的共产党在莫斯科举行会议，标志着世界政治力量对比中的新的转折点。从那时以来，国际形势的发展愈来愈有利于以伟大的苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营。社会主义各国的兄弟团结进一步加强了，中苏两国的兄弟团结进一步加强了。大家知道，我国第一个五年计划的超额完成是同苏联以及其他兄弟国家给予我国的巨大援助分不开的；在第二个五年计划期间，苏联和其他兄弟国家仍将继续给予我们多方面的慷慨援助，使我国得以更迅速地向建成社会主义的伟大目标猛进。
    这次提请大会审议的一九五八年度国民经济计划（草案），是估计到上面所说的形势拟订的，并且还保留了一定的后备力量。因此，这个计划是充分可靠的，是有可能超额完成的。
    现在已经到了一九五八年二月份。从国家准备的基本建设投资、农业生产的伟大高潮、工业的增产节约运动这些方面来看，今年国民经济新跃进的趋势，已经初步地显露出来了。全国人民应当千方百计地为实现这个国民经济的新跃进而奋斗。
    一九五八年的基本建设总投资额，拟定为一百四十五亿七千七百万元，比一九五七年的预计数增加了二十二亿元，增长百分之十七点八。在上述总投资额中，还没有包括广大农业合作社、手工业合作社和其他合作社的基本建设投资在内。去冬以来，各地农村进行的规模宏大的兴修农田水利的运动，在一九五八年将进一步展开，这在实际上是对于基本建设的一笔很大的投资。因此，一九五八年我国基本建设的速度和规模，将比以往任何一年都要大得多。
    根据农业生产高潮的新形势，一九五八年农业和农副业总产值，拟定为六百八十八亿三千万元（按一九五七年不变价格计算），比一九五七年增长百分之六点一。这个速度，大大地超过了我国第一个五年计划的平均速度。以粮食和棉花的产量来说，一九五八年粮食的指标为三千九百二十亿斤，比上一年增加二百二十亿斤，增长百分之五点九；棉花的指标为三千五百万担，比上一年增加二百二十万担，增长百分之六点七；这些速度都是相当高的。
    一九五八年的工业总产值，拟定为六百四十三亿七千万元（按一九五七年不变价格计算），比一九五七年预计数增加八十一亿九千万元，增长百分之十四点六。这个速度，比一九五七年要高得多。但是，应当估计到，地方工业的潜力很大，这个指标是可能大大超过的。
    这里，我想附带地说明一下关于从一九五八年起改用一九五七年的不变价格计算工业和农业的总产值的问题。在第一个五年计划期间，工业和农业的总产值是按一九五二年的不变价格计算的。由于几年来，工农业产品的价格，经过多次合理的调整，一部分农产品的价格提高了，大部分重工业产品的价格降低了，同时，几年来，试制和生产了很多新种类的工业产品，并没有一九五二年的不变价格，所以一九五二年的不变价格已经不能确切地反映当前工农业生产水平的实际情况。因此，决定从一九五八年开始，在计算工业和农业的总产值的时候，采用一九五七年的不变价格。如果仍然按照一九五二年的不变价格计算，一九五八年的工业总产值则为七百一十九亿六千万元，农业和农副业总产值则为六百四十二亿五千万元。
    在一九五八年的工业生产中，重工业各部门的生产，仍然保持了比较高的发展速度，大多数重工业产品的增长速度，超过了整个工业的增长速度，机器制造工业总产值比上一年增长百分之二十七，许多机械产品的增长速度更高得多。轻工业各部门的生产，由于一九五七年的农业收成比较好，增长速度大大提高。例如，棉纱的产量，比上一年增加将近六十万件，增长百分之十二点七；糖的产量，比上一年增加十七万三千吨，增长百分之二十点六。
    这些，就是一九五八年度基本建设和工农业生产计划的最主要的指标。由于我们对于当前和今后形势的发展还可能有估计不足的地方，因此，在执行计划的过程中，必须随时注意经济形势的变化，各种有利条件的发展，及时地检查、修正和补充原定的计划，并且争取超额完成计划。
    （三）一九五八年国民经济各部门发展计划的安排
    计划草案对一九五八年国民经济各部门发展的安排，主要如下。
    第一、关于基本建设
    按照一九五八年发展国民经济的主要任务，在投资的分配上，增加了农业部门特别是水利建设部门的投资，增加了重工业部门特别是燃料、电力、冶金、化工和其他为农业服务的工业部门的投资。同时，适应行政管理体制的改进，也增加了各省、市和各民族自治区的建设投资，以促进面向农村、为农村服务的地方工业的发展，和少数民族地区经济的发展。
    一九五八年计划继续施工和开始施工的限额以上的建设项目共有一千一百八十五个，其中工业建设项目是七百一十六个，农林水利建设项目是一百八十五个，交通运输建设项目是一百零六个，商业建设项目是四十七个，文教卫生建设项目是六十个，城市公用事业建设项目是四十七个，其他建设项目是二十四个。在工业建设项目中，属于中央各部的是五百六十七个，属于地方的是一百四十九个。这些工业建设项目，在今年内可以建设完工的有一百八十八个，平均每四十六小时，就将有一个新的重大的工厂或者矿山建设完工，并且开始投入生产。这一切都说明，我国基本建设的规模在今年将更加扩大，新的生产能力在今年将有更多的增加。
    各工业部门的建设情况是这样：
    冶金工业。冶金工业部有五十七个建设项目，地方有十四个建设项目，共计七十一个。重要的有鞍山、武汉、包头三大钢铁工业基地，太原、石景山、重庆、昆明、大冶、马鞍山等钢铁厂，安徽、甘肃、云南等铜矿，等等。这些建设项目，在今年内可以建设完工的有十四个，例如大冶钢厂，安徽铜官山矿务局，江西钨矿和云南铅矿，等等；同时，鞍山钢铁联合企业将基本上建设完成。由于这些项目的建设完工，冶金工业在今年内新增加的生产能力有：生铁一百八十八万吨，钢一百一十六万六千吨，钢材七十六万二千吨，铜采选五百吨（日处理矿量），等等。当这些新的生产能力发挥出来的时候，我国的钢铁和有色金属，就可以在数量和品种方面，更多地供应机器制造工业和其他方面的需要。
    结合大型冶金企业的建设，积极发展地方中、小型冶金企业，是中央发展冶金工业的一个重要方针。今年地方新建和扩建的十四个冶金企业，有乌鲁木齐八一钢铁厂，南京钢铁厂，浙江杭县钢铁厂，福建三明钢铁厂，江西钢铁厂，广州钢铁厂，贵阳钢铁厂，等等。
    电力工业。电力工业部有一百零一个建设项目，地方有十八个建设项目，共计一百一十九个。在这一百一十九个项目中，电站有一百个，其中火力电站是七十六个，水电站是二十四个。重要的有：北京、太原、包头、兰州、抚顺、洛阳、武汉、江苏望亭等地的火电站，浙江的新安江和百丈漈、云南的以礼河、辽宁的桓仁和大伙房、湖南的柘溪、四川灌县的紫坪铺、北京的下马岭、福建的古田、广东的流溪河、安徽的梅山和响洪甸等水电站。这些建设项目，在今年内可以建设完工的有三十五个，新增加的发电设备能力为九十多万瓩，每年可发电四十五亿度以上。
    今后电力工业的建设，应当坚决执行中共中央所提出的以水电为主、火电为辅的长期建设方针。中央有关部门应当帮助地方建设中、小型水电站。长江三峡水利枢纽工程，从今年起，应当积极进行流域规划和勘察设计等各项准备工作。
    燃料工业。煤炭工业部和石油工业部共有二百个建设项目，地方有三十二个建设项目，共计二百三十二个。地方建设的三十二个项目，有三十一个是煤矿，其中新开工矿井的设计能力为年产煤七百零一万吨。燃料工业的建设项目，在今年内可以建设完工的有五十二个，新增加的采煤能力将达二千四百四十二万吨，新增加的人造石油的炼制能力将达二万吨以上。
    加强地方中、小型煤矿的建设，就能够更多地供应当地民用煤的需要。
    为着改变石油工业的落后状况，中共中央已经提出发展天然石油和人造石油齐头并进的方针。有关部门和地方，在继续积极进行天然石油的勘探、开采工作的同时，必须大力进行人造石油的资源勘察，并且积极创造条件，进行厂矿的设计和建设工作。
    机械工业。机械工业各部共有七十七个建设项目，地方有两个建设项目，共计七十九个。重要的有：富拉尔基和金州的重型机器厂，洛阳的拖拉机厂和矿山机械厂，哈尔滨和洛阳的滚珠轴承厂，兰州的石油机械厂，哈尔滨、西安、湘潭等地的电机厂，等等。这些建设项目，在今年内可以建设完工的有二十七个。重要的有：武汉重型机床厂，洛阳的滚珠轴承厂和矿山机械厂，沈阳高压开关厂，等等。由于这些工厂的建设完工，可以增加的制造能力，按年产量计算如下：冶金机械三万吨，矿山机械二万七千吨，重型机床二万吨，滚珠轴承一千万套以上。这就表明，一九五八年将是我国重型机器制造工业得到新的发展的一年，机器制造工业中的薄弱环节，将由此得到加强，我国发展重工业所需要的大型设备，就将更多地由国内供应。
    化学工业。化学工业部有二十三个建设项目，地方有十九个建设项目，共计四十二个。其中，化学肥料厂有十七个。重要的有：由中央建设的兰州、太原、吉林（二期）等肥料厂，大连化工厂（扩建），南京永利化工厂（扩建）等；由地方建设的四川和浙江氮肥厂，福建石灰氮厂，江西石灰氮厂等。这些建设项目，在今年内可以建设完工的有四个。重要的有：山西磷肥厂，南京磷肥厂，江苏锦屏磷矿等。由此而新增加的生产能力有：合成氨四万七千吨，磷肥五十四万八千吨，磷矿石粉三十万吨。当这些生产能力发挥出来的时候，我国的化学肥料的产量将得到较多的增加，更多地供应农业发展的需要。
    鼓励地方建设化学肥料工厂，是中央促进农业发展的一个重要方针。化学工业和机械工业部门，应当帮助地方解决设计和设备供应的问题。
    建筑材料工业。建筑材料工业部和森林工业部共有三十三个建设项目，地方有十一个建设项目，共计四十四个。其中包括十个水泥厂和二十三个森林工业企业。这些项目，在今年内可以建设完工的有七个，新增加水泥生产能力八十三万三千吨和木材运出能力四百八十五万立方公尺。为了适应农村兴修中、小型水利和其他建设工程对于水泥的需要，建筑材料工业部门应当协助地方分散地建设小型水泥厂，大量生产低标号水泥。
    轻工业。纺织工业部、轻工业部和食品工业部共有三十九个建设项目，地方有五十三个建设项目，共计九十二个。其中包括棉纺织、印染厂十五个，造纸厂二十三个，制糖厂十二个，盐场十个。这些项目，在今年内可以建设完工的有三十一个，新增加的生产能力有：棉纱三十八万七千件，棉布一亿一千万公尺，毛、麻纺锭七千三百三十枚，机制纸二十万四千吨，糖三十四万五千吨，原盐六十五万吨。
    为着扩充纺织工业和造纸工业，对于各种纤维资源，必须充分利用，并且进一步地提出关于研究和实行扩大利用这些资源的计划。
    一九五八年我国农业的基本建设，除了全国农民群众所进行的大规模的农田水利、改造土壤和其他各项建设以外，国家投资建设的水利工程，限额以上的项目有七十三个。其中，包括三十八个续建工程，如黄河三门峡水库；淮河流域的梅山水库、响洪甸水库、磨子潭水库、西淝河治理工程和濉河治理工程；沂、沭、汶、泗等河流域的伊家河治理工程和万福河治理工程；辽河流域的大伙房水库；海河流域的西岗南水库、南运河四女寺减河工程等。同时，有三十五个新的工程开工，如淮河流域的宿鸭湖蓄洪工程、油洺河治理工程、涡河治理工程、惠济河治理工程，颍河节制闸工程、二河闸工程；沂、沭、汶、泗等河流域的中运河治理工程、宿迁节制闸、江风口分洪道工程；辽河流域的新立屯水库；黄河的人民胜利渠扩建工程等。在今年内可以建设完工的，有二十一个大型水利工程。
    在水利建设中，必须继续注意水利资源的全面规划和综合利用，把防洪、灌溉、航运同水力发电结合起来。
    在治水方面，应当以蓄为主，以排为辅；在水利工程方面，应当贯彻执行以小型为主和大、中、小型相结合的方针，大量的小型工程由农业合作社办理，中型工程尽量地由农业合作社联合举办，国家给以必要的支持和帮助，大型工程由国家负责建设。
    一九五八年国家对于开垦荒地的投资是二亿三千五百万元，计划农垦部直属企业开荒七百万亩，加上地方国营农场开荒、群众性开荒和移民开荒，全国开垦荒地共达一千七百七十三万五千亩。在山区开荒的时候，应当特别注意做好水土保持的工作。
    一九五八年由国家投资造林四百二十八万三千亩；同时，群众性的种树造林运动将进一步开展起来。为了实现全国农业发展纲要修正草案关于绿化的要求，各地方必须根据当地的具体条件，分别做出森林覆盖面积的具体规划，争取时间，加速进行种树造林的绿化工作。凡是四季能种的就要争取四季都种，三季能种的就要争取三季都种，两季能种的就要争取两季都种。
    一九五八年农业机器拖拉机站计划增加拖拉机一千四百五十七台。许多农业合作社对农业技术改造的积极性很高，积累又有增加，将购置大量的新式农具和排水灌溉机械等等，以促进农业生产的发展。
    在交通运输业的基本建设方面，一九五八年国家投资共二十二亿元，其中约有三分之二左右将用于铁路建设。
    铁路建设，计划新线和复线铺轨约一千五百公里。重要的有：完成包头到兰州铁路的全线铺轨任务，使西北同内蒙古自治区沟通起来；兰州到新疆维吾尔自治区的铁路继续向西铺轨三百公里，到达哈密。一九五八年计划正式交付营业的铁路共二千二百三十四公里，将是我国铁路营业线路增加最多的一年。在这一年内，我们应当积极修筑川黔和黔桂铁路，加紧进行重点工程的建设。对于湘黔和滇黔铁路的建设，也应当大力进行准备工作，为了加快建设进度，可以分段进行施工。当这几条铁路干线在三、五年内建设完成以后，将使我国的西南地区，从北、东、南三个方向同全国沟通起来。
    公路建设，由交通部负责施工的，共有十一条线路，主要是通往西南少数民族地区的公路。
    航运建设，由交通部负责施工的，有上海、天津、重庆、湛江、海南岛八所和安徽裕溪口等港口的建设工程，同时，增加船舶七万八千吨以上。
    除了上述各部门的基本建设工程以外，对于商业部门的仓库建设，城市建设，文化、教育和卫生部门的建设，国家也根据事业发展的需要，作了相应的安排。
    为了适应今后基本建设大规模发展的需要，中央和地方必须进一步加强地质的普查、勘探工作和建筑安装工作。
    一九五八年的基本建设任务是繁重的，各部门和各地方，必须加强工作，加速进度，保证质量，降低造价，更好地完成计划。
    国民经济新的跃进，有很大可能超计划地提高生产，更多地增加财政收入，因此，我们已经准备一批基本建设的预备项目，在看到国家财政和物资有余力的时候，将立即开工建设。
    第二、关于工业生产
    一九五八年工业总产值计划达到六百四十三亿七千万元，手工业总产值计划达到一百零三亿七千万元。
    在工业和手工业总产值中，生产资料的生产为三百五十六亿六千万元，比上一年增长百分之十八点八；消费资料的生产为三百九十亿八千万元，比上一年增长百分之九点七。生产资料的生产继续优先增长，而消费资料生产的发展速度，比一九五七年也快得多了。
    一九五八年，将积极发展燃料、电力和原材料的生产，以便尽可能地适应于本年度的基本建设规模扩大、加工工业发展和整个国民经济发展的需要。例如，钢产量拟定为六百二十四万八千吨，将比一九五七年增长百分之十九点二。发电量拟定为二百二十四亿五千万度，将比一九五七年增长百分之十八。原煤产量拟定为一亿五千零七十二万四千吨，将比一九五七年增长百分之十七点二。木材和水泥的产量，也将分别比一九五七年增长百分之九点四和百分之十四点五。只有石油，因为受资源和技术等条件的限制，增产比较少，在执行计划的过程中，应当加倍努力，争取较多地超过原定的指标。
    一九五八年机械工业生产的安排，比较充分地发挥了各个机械工业部门的设备能力，以更多地满足基本建设的需要和农业技术改造的需要。机械产品中的发电设备、电动机、生产氮肥的设备、载重汽车和蒸气机车等，增长的速度都将达到百分之五十以上，这样就将大大地提高我国机器设备的自给能力。最显著的是，在苏联帮助设计的“一五六项”建设工程所需要的成套设备中，由国内制造的部分，将由一九五七年的百分之四十二左右，提高到百分之六十左右。这将是我国机器制造工业的一个跃进。
    一九五八年支援农业的机械产品的产量，将增长得更快，例如，排水灌溉机械将比一九五七年增长两倍多，当年可以供应农村的将达到五十万马力，约等于全国现有农田抽水机的总马力数。这将是机器制造工业的另一个跃进。
    在大批机器下乡的同时，有大批的技术人员、技术工人和青年知识分子下乡，对于农业生产的新高潮是一个极大的支援。
    为了适应于农业生产发展的迫切需要，一九五八年化学肥料的生产将有很大的增长。计划生产氮肥九十万六千吨，磷肥十九万六千吨，分别比上一年增长百分之三十三点七和百分之六十三点九。各种农药的生产量，也将有相当的增加。
    一九五八年轻工业产品的产量，是根据原料供应的可能来安排的，有一些是根据市场的需要来安排的。由于一九五七年的棉花、黄麻、洋麻得到丰收，甘蔗、甜菜的播种面积扩大，一九五八年的棉纱、麻袋、糖的产量，都将增长百分之十以上。水产品、机制纸、自行车和胶鞋等产品，在一九五八年的生产量，也都将增长百分之十以上。食油、面粉、卷烟等产品的产量，因为原料增加比较少，有的增长速度就稍为慢些。
    一九五八年的工业生产计划不仅注意了产量的增加，而且重视了新产品的增加。
    计划规定，仅中央各部，在这一年将有三百七十二种重要的新产品进行试制，其中包括以下一些重要产品：冷轧矽钢片，航空工业用的耐热不锈钢，氮肥工业用的高压空气压缩机和合成塔，五万瓩的全套火力发电设备，七万二千五百瓩的全套水力发电设备，二十二万伏的高压变压器，一千五百一十三立方公尺的炼铁高炉，一千一百五十公厘的轧钢机，五十四马力的履带式拖拉机，载重量一万三千多吨的远洋货轮，电视发射机和接收机，合成纤维，等等。当这些重要的新产品试制成功的时候，我国工业技术的水平将大大提高一步。
    试制新产品，是为了增加新产品。这是又多、又快、又好、又省地发展国民经济的一个重要的条件。各工业部门和各地方必须把这一项工作，当作重要的任务，认真领导，采取切实有效的措施，发挥科学技术人员和技术工人的积极性和创造性，加强技术资料的搜集和研究工作，规定奖励制度，组织各有关单位的协作，保证试制任务的胜利完成。
    试制和生产适合于我国各地方农村使用的机械，例如动力机械、耕作机械、脱粒机械、农产品初加工机械和运输机械等等，这是当前机器制造工业部门的一个特别重要的任务。机械工业部门、各地方工业部门和科学研究机关，在试制和生产这些机械的时候，要考虑到当地的自然条件，研究和提高当地群众多种多样的创造，并且应当使这些产品坚固和轻便，能综合使用，能利用当地的燃料，价钱便宜。
    必须重视产品的质量。在一九五八年，我们不仅应当使工业生产在数量方面有一个大的发展，而且应当在质量方面也有进一步的提高，大大提高合格产品的比重，尽可能消灭废品。
    上海市的许多工厂，最近特别注意了产品质量的提高，并且对于一百几十种著名的工业品，分别采取措施，争取在一定时期内，在质量方面赶上或者超过英、美等国的水平，这是很好的。我们希望各城市、各部门，根据自己的条件，经过认真研究以后，都定出切实可行的在提高工业产品质量方面的规划和措施。国家技术委员会和科学研究机关应当把这些规划集中起来，进行综合的研究，加强这方面的指导工作。
    第三、关于农业生产
    一九五八年计划粮食产量三千九百二十亿斤和棉花产量三千五百万担的指标，以及农副业的其他各项指标，都是很积极的。由于全国五亿多农民增产积极性空前高涨，只要不遇到特别严重的自然灾害，这些指标是能够达到的，并且大有超过的可能性。
    在今年，全国耕地总面积计划达到十六亿九千二百四十五万亩，比上一年增加一千零二十五万亩；全国农作物播种总面积计划达到二十四亿一千四百八十万亩，比上一年增加六千八
  百九十万亩；全国灌溉总面积计划达到六亿亩以上。
      为了给粮食和棉花的增产准备条件，在增加耕地面积、复种面积和灌溉面积的基础上，一九五八年各种粮食的播种面积安排为十八亿三千九百二十六万亩，比上一年增加三千一百七十五万亩；棉花的播种面积安排为九千零三十万亩，比上一年增加四百一十二万亩。
    在一九五八年，花生、油菜子、烤烟等作物的产量，增长速度都定得比较高。例如，花生增长百分之二十，油菜子增长百分之三十，烤烟增长百分之四十八。大豆要求增长百分之四点四。甘蔗和甜菜要求分别增长百分之二十七点五和百分之二十九点五。我们注意了增产潜力比较大的苎麻和柞蚕茧的生产，分别安排了一百四十四万担和一百四十五万七千担的产量，比上一年，苎麻将增长百分之三十二点八，柞蚕茧将增长百分之五十八点四。
    一九五八年要求大家畜——牛、马、驴、骡的数量有比较快的发展，合计比上一年增长百分之四点六，达到八千八百二十七万头，以适应农业增产对于畜力的迫切需要。有些农业合作社采取了分队、分户、分犋喂养和养用合一的制度，加强防疫工作，保护耕畜；有些农业合作社从优良种畜的产区引进优良的种畜，改良畜种，并且用各种办法保护母畜，繁殖耕畜；也有些农业合作社推行青贮饲料，建立饲料饲草基地，增加耕畜的饲料。各地应当总结这些好的经验，积极推广，力争完成今年增加耕畜的计划。
    一九五八年要求猪的头数在年底达到一亿五千万头，以增加肉食、肥料和农家收入。
    一九五八年要求造林六千五百零六万亩，同时在采伐过的林地，补种和抚育二百一十九万亩。
    国家必须有严格的规定：把森林的采伐工作同保持水土和植树造林的工作密切地结合起来。森林采伐工业部门，如果违反上述规定，应当受到处分。
    实现全国农业发展纲要修正草案，还有十年的时间，但是，决定的关键是头三年。我们的口号是苦战三年，争取在三年内，使全国大部分地区农业生产的面貌基本改观。我们的方法是全面规划，加强领导，放手发动群众，一切经过试验。
    农作物增产的主要途径，是提高单位面积的产量。前面已经说过，全国已经有不少的县，提前十年分别达到了全国农业发展纲要修正草案所规定的粮食和棉花的增产指标；从今年起，应当使更多的县达到纲要所提出的要求。根据自己的条件，在一个省的范围内，有多少个县在今年、明年和以后的年度内，达到全国农业发展纲要修正草案所提出的一九六七年的指标，由省和自治区做出规划；同样，在一个县的范围内有多少个乡，在一个乡的范围内有多少个社，在今年、明年和以后的年度内，达到一九六七年的指标，分别由县和乡做出规划。规划做出以后，应当动员群众，采取措施，保证实现。
    这里要说到，在过去几年中间，各种工业原料作物的生产不很稳定，增长的速度比较慢，对轻工业生产的更快发展，发生了不利的影响。从今年起，应当分别召开各种专业会议，对于棉花、黄麻、洋麻、苎麻、野麻、家蚕茧、柞蚕茧等纺织原料，对于大豆、花生、油菜子、油茶、油桐等油料作物，对于甘蔗、甜菜两种糖料作物，对于烟叶、茶叶、水果等土特产品和橡胶等亚热带作物，分别地研究提高产量和质量的有效办法，选择高产的典型经验，加以推广。这些工业原料作物的增产，对于增加轻工业生产，对于人民生活的改善和国家资金的积累，有着重要的作用，各个部门、各个地方都要密切关心，认真做好这方面的工作。
    应当根据现在的状况和自然条件的特点，合理地规划重要工业原料作物的种植区域和种植面积，逐步地建立新的生产基地。同时，为了不缩小粮食的种植面积，应当采取积极的措施，开辟新的门路，例如利用空地，利用河畔，利用山坡，开发山区，等等，来增加各种作物的生产。
    第四、关于人民物质生活和国内外贸易
    根据上述工业农业生产、基本建设和各项事业发展的需要，一九五八年，包括在国家计划以内的职工总数，将达到二千四百三十九万二千人，比上一年增加四十一万九千人。增加的人员主要是大学、中等专业学校、技工学校、技工训练班的毕业生和一部分转业人员。在职工总数中，今年将有相当多的人员下放到农村和厂矿的生产单位中，实行劳动锻炼。
    一九五八年的职工工资总额，计划安排为一百五十八亿元，比上一年增加五亿五千万元。在增加的工资总额中，用于新增加职工的工资约有三亿元，用于原有职工的部分升级和调整某些不合理的工资标准约有二亿五千万元。
    一九五八年供应社会的商品总量，可以达到五百亿元，比上一年增加三十亿元，增长百分之六点五。
    根据上述劳动工资的安排和商品供应的可能性，一九五八年的社会购买力估算为四百九十四亿元左右。农业合作社和农村居民的购买力将比上一年增加二十二亿元左右，城市居民的购买力将增加五亿元左右；机关、团体、企业、学校和部队因为节减公杂费开支，购买力将比上一年减少三亿元以上。三项增减相抵，净增二十四亿元。
    社会商品的可供应量超过社会购买力，不仅使市场和物价能够保持稳定，而且将使我们的商业部门保留一定的后备力量。
    一九五八年供应社会需要的主要商品，除了粮食以外，都将有所增加。例如：猪肉将增加约六亿二千万斤，水产品将增加约四亿八千二百万斤，棉布将增加约五百七十八万匹，呢绒将增加约六百六十万尺，毛线将增加约二百万斤，煤炭将增加约七百七十万吨，日用品将增加约二亿元。但是，由于我国的人口增加得比较快，个别商品的每人平均供应量，例如棉布，只能维持在一九五七年的水平上。粮食的供应量比上一年有所减少，主要是因为粮食逐年增产，过去要由国家供应粮食的农村缺粮户，现在已经有相当多一部分能够自给，而不再需要由国家供应了。
    在商业工作方面需要提起注意的，首先是必须保证对农村的生产资料的及时供应；其次是必须做好农产品的收购工作，做好可供利用的野生植物和废料的收购工作。
    在对外贸易方面，适应我国工农业生产发展的需要，一九五八年进出口贸易总额安排为一百一十亿元，比上一年增长百分之八点六。
    保证必需物资的进口，是完成一九五八年度国民经济计划的一个重要条件。为了完成进口计划，对外贸易部门应当同有关部门密切配合，大力组织出口货源，扩大外汇收入。我国可供出口的物资十分丰富，我们必须充分地发挥各级地方政府和经济部门的积极性，发掘各方面的潜在力量，积极组织生产，提高质量，加强收购工作，同时，做好新产品的试销工作，争取完成和超额完成进出口计划。
    第五、关于文化教育
    在一九五八年，国家开办的学校，招生人数将为：高等学校十万九千人，中等专业学校十五万三千人，普通中学二百零七万六千人，小学二千零十七万人。群众自办的学校的招生人数，大致估算为：高中一万人，初中十八万人，小学二百五十六万人。文化、卫生事业，也将比上一年有进一步的发展。
    在文化教育方面，必须继续加强政治思想领导。我们应当根据脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的原则，进一步地改进我们的教育制度；适应社会主义建设的高潮，进一步地提高各项文化教育工作的质量；同时，按照勤俭办学校、勤俭办文化卫生事业和依靠群众自办的原则，积极地发展文教卫生事业。为着达到这些目的，一九五八年将采取下列的一些措施。
    （1）有步骤地实行半工半读的教育制度。中等学校和高等学校，凡是有条件单独举办或者联合举办实验工厂、实验农场和实验牧场的，都可以单独举办或者联合举办，一面从事教学，一面从事生产劳动；不能举办的，可以同当地的工厂、作坊和服务行业订立生产实习合同，进行实习，或者参加当地的定期义务劳动和农业合作社劳动，使学习和劳动相结合。工业学校，都应当像西安第一航空技工学校那样，逐步地设立附属工厂或者参加有关的工厂劳动。农业学校，不论中等的或者高等的，都要逐步地同当地的农业合作社订立合同，经常使学生和教员适当地轮流到农业合作社去劳动，帮助农业合作社进行技术改革，并且尽可能地吸收一部分由农业合作社保送的学生参加学校学习。凡是有条件附设生产单位的学校，应当力争在一定时期以后使学校经费达到自给、半自给或者部分自给，以便又多、又快、又好、又省地发展我国的教育事业。
    （2）在高等学校招收的新生中，尽可能地增加工人和农民的成分。学生在毕业以后，一般应当参加一定时期的生产劳动。
    （3）中等专业学校主要是培养有文化有技术的工人和农民，学生在毕业以后一律参加工业和农业的生产。今后国家所需要的技术干部和管理干部，应当尽可能从适合条件的工人和农民中提拔。各部门在各地方的中等专业学校，应当接受当地党政的统一领导。
    （4）工农速成中学准备分别改为大学的工农预科或者正规的工农中学，一九五八年秋季继续招生，吸收经过一定劳动时间而具有初中或者高小毕业程度的优秀工人、农民和工农干部入学。
    （5）广泛地举办业余学校，进行初小程度到高中程度的文化教育，或者进行普通知识到中等程度的技术教育，吸收成年的职工学习文化和技术。同时，积极举办业余高等教育。
    （6）继续发展群众办学。群众举办的学校，课程安排和教育进度可以根据群众的意见和当地的具体情况决定，形式可
  以多种多样，学习时间可以长短不同。各级教育部门应当给以积极的帮助和指导。
    （7）为了保证在今后十年内基本上扫除青年和壮年中的文盲，必须大力开展扫除文盲的运动。
    （8）大张旗鼓地开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，分别制定并且逐步实现消灭四害和主要疾病的具体规划。
    （9）在国家的辅导下，积极开展群众性的文化活动、体育活动。
    （10）在各级学校和各类文化单位中的杂务劳动和部分建筑工程，例如打扫清洁，整修操场和道路，修筑房屋等等，应当有计划地安排时间，组织教职员和学生自己动手。
    关于科学研究工作，这里不准备多讲。目前重要的问题，是科学技术研究工作如何适应于工业农业的生产和建设大发展的形势，不断地以研究成果支援工业和农业的技术改革。全国的科学研究机构，包括行政部门和高等学校的研究机构在内，都必须继续并且尽可能扩大同有关的生产、建设单位的密切联系，签订协作合同，帮助解决生产建设中提出的问题，并且注意研究和总结职工群众的发明、创造和合理化建议。
    以郭沫若院长为首的访苏科学技术代表团已于今年一月十八日在莫斯科同苏联签订了中苏两国政府关于共同进行和苏联帮助中国进行重大科学技术研究的合作协定，并且议定了一百二十二项重大合作项目。中国科学院同苏联科学院、中国高等教育部同苏联高等教育部、中国农业科学院同苏联列宁农业科学院，也都分别签订了协议和合作项目。两国科学和技术的全面合作，对于促进我国科学和技术的迅速发展，具有重大意义。我国科学技术人员必须充分地发挥积极性和创造性，完满地实现这些协议，按期完成这些合作的科学技术研究项目，使我国的科学技术在许多重要方面能够更快地接近世界上的先进水平。
    （四）厉行节约，反对浪费
    全国解放以来，我们已经多次地进行过增产节约运动，在节减军政费用、降低建筑造价、节约非生产性建设投资、节约原材料、降低生产成本等方面，都取得了很大的成绩；但是，应当看到，各个部门、各个地方、各个单位中，都还存在着很多的浪费，并且有严重的浪费，都还有着很大的节约的可能性。
    这里举出下列的一些事实。
    在工厂、矿山、运输企业的基本建设方面，由于我们的经验不足，有相当多的资金是用得不适当的，也就是说存在着很大的浪费。我们很多同志，不区别重点企业和一般企业，不区别主要车间和辅助车间，不区别主要设备和辅助设备，一律追求高标准、机械化、自动化，使本来可以用较少的钱，在比较短的时间内建成的企业，不得不用较多的钱和较多的时间。例如，吉林省有一个制糖厂，设计标准和机械化程度很高，花费投资二千七百万元，费时三年多，才建设完成，投入生产；而和这个工厂生产能力相同的黑龙江省的另一个制糖厂，由于设计标准和机械化程度较低，投资只及吉林糖厂的百分之六十，建设时间也短得多。这种情况，在建设初期是难于完全避免的。现在，我们已经有了五年以上的建设经验，就有可能而且应当用同样数量的投资，建设更多的企业了。根据许多调查，在保证工程质量的一般情况下，现在就可以用六十元、七十元或者八十元，去办过去要用一百元钱才能办好的事情了。有的企业甚至只要花过去一半或者更少的钱，就可以很好地建设起来了。
    除了生产性的建设存在着浪费现象以外，在非生产性的建设中，也还存在着浪费现象。我们从一九五五年以来，通过降低建筑标准、削减建设项目的工作，使非生产性建设投资在整个建设投资中的比重，由过去的百分之三十以上，降低到百分之二十左右。这是一个好的成绩。但是，以第一个五年计划期间的总投资额计算，非生产性建设的投资比重，仍然占百分之二十三点四；全部非生产性的房屋建筑面积，就达一亿六千万平方公尺，大体相当于解放前北京市的全部房屋面积的六倍，共用投资一百一十亿元。这个数字显然是过大了。现在，还有不少工作人员不了解，过多、过好、过早地进行非生产性的建设，并不能促进生产，而只能妨碍生产，因而许多地方还存在着非生产性的建设项目过多、标准过高的现象。如果把这些现象纠正过来，也就可以省出很多的资金，扩大生产性建设的投资。
    除了上述生产性建设和非生产性建设中所存在的浪费现象以外，现在，在很多工业、商业、运输等企业中，也还存在许多严重的浪费现象。例如，材料积压，材料浪费，废品、次品过多，资金积压，经营环节过多，管理人员过多，仓库管理不善，等等。在材料积压方面，单就钢材来说，如果适当地压缩库存，并且想尽各种办法节约使用，就可使生产企业和基本建设单位的钢材周转数量减少三分之一左右。
    应当指出，在我们不少的机关、部队、学校和事业单位中，铺张浪费的现象还相当普遍，事业费的开支，还有许多用得不适当的地方，在节约人员和节约经费方面，都还有很大的潜力。
    所有上列各项缺点，都必须坚决改正。在一九五八年，我们必须继续为厉行节约、反对浪费而斗争，把这种斗争看成是发展国民经济的重大任务。
    我们准备采取以下各项主要措施。
    第一，修订基本建设工作的有关制度，规定适合于我国当前经济条件的各类企业的设计规范，和民用建筑的造价标准，以保证进一步地贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针。一九五八年计划新开工的限额以上的工矿建设项目，必须有经过相应机关批准的设计文件，才能施工。准备在一九五九年列入计划的建设项目，从现在起就要提前做好设计。今后除了某些特殊的项目，经过国务院的批准可以边设计边施工以外，没有设计文件的项目，一律不列入年度计划。继续审查和修改现有的重要企业和重要工程的设计文件，削减不必要的建设项目，降低不适当的、过高的标准。对于整个基本建设，今年要求节约总投资额的百分之七至百分之十，用于扩大工作量。
    第二，各个经济部门和所有企业，都要加强经济核算的工作，改善物资供应制度，建立必要的供应基地，保证企业所需要的原材料能够及时供应。重新核定工矿企业和商业企业的流动资金。生产企业在提高质量的基础上，必须超额完成降低成本的任务。商业企业必须超额完成降低流通费用的任务，为此，应当减少经营环节，大量减少人员，下放多余的职工参加劳动生产。
    第三，彻底清理工矿、交通运输、建筑安装和商业等企业的仓库，大大地压缩企业库存的生产资料，用之于扩大生产和扩大基本建设。各基本建设单位的积存设备，需要和可能安装的都应当安装起来；自己不需要的，可以由主管部门调给需要的单位，以便进行调剂。这样，就可以在不增加国家财政拨款的条件下，扩大基本建设的规模，增加新的生产能力。在清理仓库的同时，应当采取领导同群众相结合的方法，重新核定生产企业和基本建设企业的主要物资消耗定额和库存定额，并且改进仓库管理制度，减少物资损耗和事故。在清理仓库的时候，各个部门、各个单位都应当据实报告，不准虚报隐瞒；否则，应当给以批评和处分。
    第四，合理组织劳动，节约使用劳动力。我国现有企业的职工人数，一般是过多的。解决这个问题的办法，除了现有企业增产尽可能不增加工人以外，今后新开工的企业，应当根据开工率的高低，逐步增加职工，不准过多过早地招收职工。凡计划规定新增加职工的单位，应当在当地现有的多余职工中进行调配；在当地不能调配的时候，一般地只准就近招收临时工人。对于现有多余的职工，除了按照可能的条件扩大原企业，使工人数目同工作量能够相称以外，还可以考虑在保证职工原有收入的条件下，经过鸣放辩论和教育说服，由国家进行适当调配，把某些部门多余的职工，调配给那些人力不足的部门。例如，把工业、交通运输部门多余的职工，调配到农场劳动；或者把某些正式工人，改做临时工的工作等等。这样，对职工个人来说，并无损失；对国家来说，却可以增加生产，增加财富，于公于私，都有好处。现有的和新举办的企业和事业单位，应当采取各种各样的形式，利用城乡居民中的剩余劳动力和半劳动力，从事代销、代购、代办等业务，以尽量减少正式的从业人员。
    现在全国各机关、团体、部队、企业、事业单位和合作社的职工群众，正在开展反浪费运动，在这个运动中，已经创造出多种多样的节约办法，有关方面应当经过群众的讨论，把那些好的办法，从制度上巩固起来，坚持执行下去。
    毛主席说：“要使全体干部和全体人民经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”
    目前全国正在进行整风运动，这是厉行节约、反对浪费的一个大好时机。每一个单位都必须切实执行毛主席的上述指示，把厉行节约、反对浪费作为在整风运动中一个重要的专题，大鸣大放，大整大改，在全国掀起一个反对浪费的运动，让群众增产节约的烽火，烧遍全国的各个角落，彻底纠正各个部门、各个地方、各个单位的领导上对厉行节约、反对浪费的右倾保守思想，彻底揭露并且坚决纠正各种浪费现象，争取反浪费斗争的全面胜利。
    （五）充分依靠和发挥群众的积极情和创造性，完成和超额完成一九五八年度的国民经济计划
    一九五八年度的国民经济计划经过大会讨论通过以后，就要下达到全国各地方、各企业、各学校和各个事业单位执行了。如前所说，这个计划不但可以完成，而且更多地超额完成的可能性是完全存在的。这种可能性能否变为现实性，关键在于领导能否同群众相结合，在于各级领导组织采取什么态度和什么方法。
    是站在运动前面，充分依靠群众，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，来完成和超额完成计划呢？还是落在形势发展的后面，落在群众要求的后面，强调困难条件，强调消极因素，把本部门、本单位的计划定得低低的，过着工作较轻松的日子呢？是把本部门、本单位的计划交给群众讨论，启发群众的智慧，集中群众的意见，加以修改和补充，使它成为更加积极的和更有动员作用的计划呢？还是依靠少数人在办公室里关起门来编制计划，单纯使用行政命令的办法去执行，使计划不能同群众的积极性和创造性相结合，而成为毫无生气的官样文章呢？
    我们的党和人民政府在进行各项工作的时候，历来都是强调群众观点和群众路线的。像编制和执行国民经济计划这样关系到千百万群众的事情，关系到全国六亿人民的事情，如果不广泛发动和组织群众来进行，那就不可能订出接近实际的真正先进的经济计划；订出来了，也不可能很好地去执行。而如果认真地把群众发动起来，把计划变成为群众的真正自觉的计划，当然就将是完全不同的另一回事了。
    去年秋季开始的工农业生产新高潮更加证明：一切经济计划经过群众的讨论，经过群众的自觉的执行，许多原来被认为是先进的指标，也都变成了落后的指标；许多长期不能解决的问题，很快地解决了；许多过去认为要花很多钱才能办好的事情，用很少的钱就办好了；许多原来想不到的好办法，群众都想出来了；许多没有发掘的潜在力量，不断地被发掘出来了。例如，甘肃阿干镇煤矿原来日产量总是停留在六百吨到八百五十吨之间，不能增长上去，但是经过整风运动，大鸣大放，大整大改，现在日产量已经达到一千二百多吨，并且正在为日产一千五百吨奋斗。武昌车辆厂一九五七年上半年出勤率总是提不高，经过群众性的大鸣大放和大整大改，到去年十一月已经提高到百分之九十九。辽宁省的基本建设单位，经过群众性的整改工作，出现了大批“生产好、质量好、安全好、纪律好、出勤好、团结好”的先进单位和先进工作者。在讨论今年计划草案的时候，也有许多这样动人的范例。拿北京京西矿务局来说，国家经济委员会和煤炭工业部给他们原定的煤炭产量的指标是二百八十五万吨，比上年增长百分之二十一，就已经认为是比较先进的了，但是，经过群众讨论以后，提高到三百零五万吨，比原定指标又增加百分之十以上，而且职工们还提出了再超额生产煤炭十五万吨，作为奋斗目标。在农业方面，像前面所说的全国农田水利建设运动的迅速发展，就是一种非常突出的例子；最近在报纸上还不断地登载了很多的这类事实，这里就不再重复说了。毫无疑义，只要我们所有的基层单位，都能像上述单位一样，像一切先进的农业合作社一样，英勇奋斗，挖掘潜力，把增加产量、提高质量、降低成本、提高劳动生产率等项指标，交给群众去充分地认真地讨论，把国家计划同群众的自觉和实践结合起来，把国家制定的必须完成的计划，同经过群众讨论提出的努力争取完成的增产计划结合起来，超额完成国家计划，就有充分可靠的保证。
    在把计划交给群众讨论和组织群众执行的过程中，必然会出现许多先进单位和先进人物。经济工作人员特别是经济领导人员的责任，就是要时刻注意发现先进的事物，认真总结和推广先进经验，采取“抓住先进和落后两头，带动中间”的方法，切实地帮助落后单位，赶上先进，使先进单位更加先进。这样做，可能在国民经济各部门中不断地发生新的不平衡。这种由先进单位所带动起来的新的不平衡，是促进经济进一步发展的一种好现象。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“所谓平衡，就是矛盾的暂时的相对的统一。过了一年，就整个说来，这种平衡就被矛盾的斗争所打破了，这种统一就变化了，平衡成为不平衡，统一成为不统一，又需要作第二年的平衡和统一，这就是我们计划经济的优越性，事实上，每月每季都在局部地打破这种平衡和统一，需要作出局部的调整。”所以，在经济发展的过程中，由平衡到不平衡，再到新的平衡，如此螺旋式地反复，不断前进，这是一种正常的现象。当不平衡现象出现的时候，有两种不同的处理方法：一种是积极的方法，对新生事物感到高兴，促进它的生长，依靠群众的力量，及时地消除薄弱环节，使经济的发展达到新的更高的水平。另一种是消极的方法，对新生事物熟视无睹，没有热情，对不平衡现象感到惶恐，不是努力把落后推向先进，而是企图让先进迁就落后。这两种方法的区别，就是毛主席所说的促进派和促退派的区别。
    我们的经济工作人员要成为社会主义建设的促进派，不要成为促退派，也不要成为现状维持派。我们过去用愚公移山的精神赢得了革命的胜利，我们现在要用同样的精神来赢得社会主义建设的胜利。因此，我们必须认真地实现党中央和毛主席所指示的领导同群众相结合的方针，“从群众中来，到群众中去”，打掉官气，打掉官僚主义，打掉宗派主义，打掉主观主义，坚决地依靠党的组织，依靠群众的组织，依靠各级地方组织，充分地发动广大群众的积极性。
    在伟大的社会主义建设高潮中，我们满怀着信心，坚决执行党中央和毛主席关于“多、快、好、省”的指示，为完成和超额完成一九五八年度的国民经济计划而奋斗！
