We fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

Now, we will make a joint statement on the issue of opposing local nationalism.

On the ideological front, we must adhere to the proletarian view of the nation, thoroughly criticize bourgeois nationalism, so as to further consolidate national unity and accelerate the construction of socialism.

During the period of reactionary rule in Yunnan, the people of all ethnic groups had no political rights, and were extremely poor and backward in economy and culture; various ethnic groups were isolated from each other, discriminated against, and even "pulled things" and "fought grievances" against each other, often resulting in family ruin and mutual harm. Only with the great victory of the people's revolution did this tragic history end. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, a series of arduous and complex tasks have been carried out. A new relationship of unity, friendship, and mutual assistance has been established among the ethnic groups. The vast majority of minority nationalities have implemented regional autonomy; a large number of minority ethnic cadres have been trained. The minority areas with a population of 4 million in the interior have basically realized the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production; the areas with a population of 1.5 million in the border areas have completed peaceful consultation on land reform, and have steadily carried out the cooperative movement; more than 400 agricultural production cooperatives have also been established in the direct transition areas with a population of 600,000. The political consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups is increasing day by day, and they love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, love the motherland family and the cause of socialism. These great achievements have fundamentally changed the face of all ethnic groups, and have provided a new foundation and favorable conditions for socialist economic and cultural construction. The current important task is to further consolidate national unity and strive to accelerate the construction of socialism. To ensure the smooth realization of this great task, it is of great significance on the ideological front to adhere to the proletarian view of the nation and thoroughly criticize bourgeois nationalism.

Under the new situation of struggle, local nationalist ideology has become a dangerous trend that cannot be ignored. Some ambitious elements of minority ethnic groups, taking advantage of the relatively weak socialist economic, class, and ideological foundations in minority ethnic groups, and the unsolidified socialist system, openly peddle capitalist poison under the guise of nationality. It is necessary to improve the socialist consciousness of minority masses and cadres through rectification and socialist education, and draw a clear line between right and wrong in the major issues of socialism and capitalism in ethnic issues.

Nationalism is absolutely incompatible with communism. Both Han chauvinism and local nationalism are manifestations of bourgeois ideology on the issue of nationalities, which are not conducive to the unity and unification of the motherland, the construction of socialism, and the prosperity and development of all nationalities. In recent years, the Party and the government have continuously educated Han cadres and Han people, and vigorously opposed Han chauvinism, which has played a major role in realizing national equality, strengthening national unity, and promoting various social reforms. In the future, continuing to oppose Han chauvinism will still be a regular task on the ideological front. However, it should be pointed out that under the new situation of struggle, local nationalist ideology has grown to a certain extent, some of which are quite serious, and has become a dangerous trend that cannot be ignored. This is because the exploited classes that have been eliminated and will be eliminated in minority ethnic groups are not reconciled to their failure, and some ambitious elements among them attempt to use national issues to struggle and resist. In addition, the rampant attacks of bourgeois right-wing elements in the previous period have also had some negative effects in minority ethnic groups, and have resonated with some people with nationalist ideas. Of course, the elements who adhere to the reactionary position of local nationalism are only a very small number; the broad masses of minority ethnic groups support socialism, love the motherland, maintain national unity, and demand common progress. However, since the socialist revolution is an extremely broad and profound revolutionary struggle, it not only eliminates classes once and for all, but also touches all aspects of the people's production, life, and traditional habits and psychological states. The national prejudices and habits of small private owners left over from history have not been completely eliminated; the foundation of the working class of minority ethnic groups is still very weak, or there is basically no working class, and the economy and culture are still relatively backward. And the vast majority of ethnic cadres are from non-proletarian backgrounds, have not undergone strict revolutionary training and transformation, and many people have not established a communist worldview and lack socialist ideological preparation. In short, in the various ethnic minorities in Yunnan, the socialist economic foundation, class foundation, and ideological foundation are relatively weak, and the socialist system is not yet consolidated. As a result, local nationalist elements have found their market here. These people openly sell the poison of capitalism under the guise of nationality. We must improve the socialist consciousness of minority masses and cadres through rectification and socialist education, draw a clear line between right and wrong in the major issues of socialism and capitalism in ethnic issues, and resolutely overcome local nationalist ideology.

What are the fundamental differences between us and local nationalism, and what struggles must be carried out?

When implementing socialist reforms and launching the cooperative movement, we must pay full attention to the characteristics and customs of each ethnic group, and better integrate the basic principles of socialism with the specific conditions of each ethnic group, and unify commonality and specificity, so as to promote the economic and cultural development of all ethnic groups. The purpose of doing this is to promote, not to hinder.

First, local nationalism opposes the common path of socialism and the basic principles of socialism to national characteristics, puts national issues first, and opposes socialism and necessary social reforms under the pretext of national characteristics or special circumstances. They believe that "cooperatives are only suitable for the Han people, not for minority ethnic groups," "after collectivization, national characteristics no longer exist," "unified purchase and sales of grain destroy our national customs and remove our national characteristics." This statement completely violates objective truth. We are Marxists, and we have always believed that the essence of national issues is class issues, and the root of national oppression is class oppression. Lenin said: "The bourgeoisie always puts its national demands first and treats them as absolute; while the proletariat believes that national demands should be subordinate to the interests of the class struggle." This is the fundamental difference between the proletarian view of the nation and the bourgeois view of the nation. Our country is a country led by the proletariat, "the theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism" (Chairman Mao), and the common desire and common demand of the people of all ethnic groups in the country is to build our country into a great socialist republic. These principles have been solemnly stipulated in our country's constitution. From the actual situation in Yunnan, it is precisely because the Party and the government have earnestly implemented the fundamental principle that national interests are subordinate to the great socialist interests, and have gradually implemented social reforms and socialist transformation in accordance with the different characteristics of each ethnic group, that the relationship between ethnic groups and the state of production and life have undergone fundamental changes. Taking the Kucun ethnic group as an example, during the period of reactionary rule, they had five fears: "fear of being beaten, fear of being arrested, fear of being killed, fear of paying grain, and fear of paying money." They were forced to flee to the deep mountains and wild streams on the border, living a very poor primitive life, not daring to go down the dams, not daring to settle down, and often migrating. They relied on a few broken machetes and wooden sticks to plant corn and collect wild plants to fill their hunger; babies were wrapped in banana leaves, and young men and women in their teens had no pants to wear. After liberation, thanks to the strong support of the Party and the government, the help of other ethnic groups, and the efforts of the people of this ethnic group, they left the deep mountains and wild streams and settled in the semi-mountainous areas, had agricultural tools and draught animals, gradually organized, developed production, and established primary schools; they trained activists, some of whom joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, and participated in work. These examples vividly prove that only by completely eliminating class oppression can national issues be fundamentally resolved. Through social reforms and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the minority ethnic areas have increased production year after year; and the increase in production is greater than that in the Han areas. Last year, the cooperatives in the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture and the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture generally increased production by 10% to 20%, and more than 90% of the members increased their income. The average income of the cooperative members in Jinghong increased from 58.2 yuan in 1955 to 99.8 yuan, and the production and life of one-third of the original poor peasants and hired peasants has been raised to the level of ordinary middle peasants; the average income of the members of the Manyangguan Cooperative in Menghun reached 2,700 catties of grain, and each household had eight pigs, exceeding the level of the local well-to-do middle peasants. Therefore, the vast number of minority ethnic farmers call the cooperatives "happiness stakes" and "the sun sent by Chairman Mao," and compiled such a song: "It is difficult to build a wall with a single foundation, and it is difficult to build a house with a single pillar; it is not enough to eat when working alone, and there is surplus grain when running a cooperative," which is a correct summary of personal experience. Although there will be some difficulties in the early stage of collectivization, the minority ethnic farmers have not been deterred, expressing that "whether we eat dry or thin, we must do it to the end," and put forward the slogan "one hole for one person, ten people for one set, socialism is coming soon," and their enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high, and they are currently enthusiastically engaged in the high tide of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation together with the Han people. These facts have shattered the rumors that "cooperatives are not suitable for minority ethnic groups." Of course, due to the different historical conditions of each ethnic minority and the complex situation, when implementing social reforms and launching the cooperative movement, we must pay full attention to the characteristics and customs of each ethnic group, adopt appropriate methods and steps, and better integrate the basic principles of socialism with the specific conditions of each ethnic group, and unify commonality and specificity, so as to carry out work more effectively and promote the economic and cultural development of all ethnic groups; the purpose of doing this is to promote, not to hinder.

We must adopt a differentiated attitude towards national characteristics and customs. Those that are conducive to the prosperity and development of the ethnic group, conducive to national unity, and conducive to socialist construction are not only respected, but also maintained and promoted; backward national characteristics and customs should be gradually reformed according to the voluntary will of the people of the ethnic group.

The so-called national characteristics and customs should be analyzed concretely to see what kind of national characteristics and customs they are, and a differentiated attitude should be adopted. It must be affirmed that the people of all ethnic minorities in Yunnan, like the Han people, have formed many excellent national characteristics and customs in the long process of history and in the long-term practice of production and life. For example, diligence and bravery, thrift and economy, rich in wisdom and creativity; hatred of the system of oppression and exploitation, love of the motherland and love of their own ethnic group, and a desire for progress and development, with a beautiful tradition of culture and art; minority women, like men, are skilled in production, and in some places, they are also the main labor force. These are the most important things in national characteristics and customs. These things are conducive to the prosperity and development of the ethnic group, conducive to the unity of all ethnic groups, and conducive to socialist construction; therefore, they are not only respected, but also maintained and promoted. However, on the other hand, it cannot be denied that due to the long-term reactionary rule and the profound influence of the old social system and the reactionary ruling class, there are also some backward things in the so-called national characteristics and customs. For example, in some places, slash-and-burn cultivation relies on the weather; they do not believe in medicine and believe in ghosts and gods; some even cut people's heads to sacrifice grain; these are certainly not the mainstream, but they hinder the prosperity and development of the ethnic group, hinder the unity of all ethnic groups, and hinder socialist construction. Therefore, gradually reforming them according to the conscious and voluntary will of the people of the ethnic group is in line with the provisions of the constitution and the advanced requirements of the masses. Any national characteristics and customs are the products of history and are not immutable. With the development of the times and the changes in the social system, with the development of the political, economic, and cultural development of all ethnic groups and changes in ideology and consciousness, as well as the mutual influence of all ethnic groups, national characteristics and customs will change, gradually eliminate old and backward factors, and increase new and progressive factors. This is an inevitable trend and a gratifying phenomenon. The fallacy of local nationalists that collectivization and unified purchase and sales policies have destroyed national characteristics and customs cannot withstand criticism. Is it possible that the feudal exploitation system and the private ownership of small producers, the free market for grain, and speculation and profiteering, etc., are the inherent characteristics and customs of minority ethnic groups? On the contrary, this old system is an important source of poverty and backwardness of the people of minority ethnic groups. Therefore, taking appropriate methods and steps to gradually change this old system is necessary for all ethnic minorities to rise to socialist ethnic groups, thereby gaining the support of the broad masses of the people.

If any ethnic group leaves the big family of the motherland and leaves the unified leadership of the central government, it will inevitably leave the broad road of socialism and return to the old road of being oppressed and enslaved. In order to seek common prosperity and development, it is necessary to strengthen the unity and mutual assistance between all ethnic groups, especially the unity between minority ethnic groups and the Han people. Minority ethnic groups cannot develop alone without the help of the Han people.

Second, local nationalists, pretending to represent national interests, attempt to alienate the relationship between all ethnic groups and the motherland, undermine the unity of the motherland, and create division, saying that "without the help of the state, our ethnic group can also develop itself," "it is better to be born in a semi-colonial country than to be born in China," and even arrogantly want to establish a "certain ethnic republic." On the issue of ethnic relations, they are conservative and xenophobic, attempting to "work alone," opposing unity and mutual assistance between ethnic groups, and slander the specific measures taken by the Party and the government in accordance with the different levels of development of each ethnic group as "favoring one over the other" and "unequal treatment"; they slander immigration and developing the border areas as "the Han people are coming to occupy our place"; they exaggerate the ethnic rifts left over from history as "irreconcilable gulfs"; they slander the progressive phenomenon of mutual contact, mutual influence, and mutual integration between ethnic groups in the socialist advance as "cultural assimilation and elimination," and slander the relationship between the Han people and minority ethnic groups as "the relationship between wolves and sheep," "we were oppressed by the Han people in the past, and we are still oppressed by the Han people now." The reactionary nature of this argument is self-evident. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have gone through a long period of arduous struggle and achieved the great victory of the people's revolution, and established the unified People's Republic of China, thereby fundamentally changing ethnic relations, ending the system of national oppression, implementing the principle of national equality, and promoting friendship and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups. This is a fact that everyone has witnessed. According to their own personal experiences, the ethnic minorities of Yunnan deeply understand that only within the unified family of the motherland and under the unified leadership of the central government can they jointly build a socialist society and enable all ethnic groups to prosper and develop. If any ethnic group leaves the big family of the motherland and leaves the unified leadership of the central government, it will inevitably leave the broad road of socialism and return to the old road of being oppressed and enslaved. At the same time, in order to seek common prosperity and development, it is necessary to strengthen the unity and mutual assistance between all ethnic groups, especially the unity between minority ethnic groups and the Han people. The Han people in our country have a large population, and their politics, economy, and culture are relatively developed, occupying a leading position, and this is also the case in Yunnan. Minority ethnic groups cannot develop independently without the help of the Han people. The broad masses of minority ethnic groups and the vast majority of ethnic cadres deeply understand the importance of national unity and warmly welcome the help of the Han people and Han cadres. In order to achieve the destruction of the unity of the motherland and the unity of ethnic groups, local nationalists also used the issue of ethnic regional autonomy, under the pretext of autonomous rights and the nationalization of autonomous organs, to exclude foreign cadres, insisting that "foreign cadres hinder the realization of ethnic autonomous rights," advocating that "all positions in the autonomous prefecture should be held by people of this ethnic group to be considered nationalized," "only cadres of this ethnic group can serve this ethnic group," and even clamoring that "minority ethnic autonomy, the Han people are the masters" and breathing out of the same nostrils as the right-wing element Long Yun. As everyone knows, the policy of ethnic regional autonomy stipulated in our country's constitution is a policy determined based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism on ethnic issues, combined with the historical development and actual situation of our country. The facts of the past few years have fully proved the correctness of this policy. The nationalization of autonomous organs must be subordinate to the nature of state power, which is the most fundamental issue in realizing the autonomous rights of all ethnic groups. Nationalization is to embody the leadership of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance through the use of ethnic forms, the use of ethnic languages, and the appointment of ethnic cadres. The purpose of nationalization is to better give play to the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic minorities, to unite more closely within the big family of the motherland, and to strive for the common construction of socialism. The nationalization of cadres must first be the socialistization of cadres, and must never be understood as "pure and simple." The idea of "pure and simple" not only hinders autonomous organs from contacting the masses and hinders gathering wisdom, but also, if developed, will inevitably fall into the evil trap of political careerists creating national division and undermining national unity. Local nationalists distort the fact that the Party does not pay attention to minority ethnic cadres, saying that there are too few ethnic cadres, that they have positions without power. The actual situation is by no means the case. Since the liberation of Yunnan, under the vigorous cultivation of the Party and the government, minority ethnic cadres have gone from nothing to something, from few to many. The village-level grassroots organizations in all ethnic areas have basically been led by cadres of their own ethnic group; in the leading organs above the district level, more than 27,000 minority ethnic cadres are in charge of or participate in leading work. In the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, there were only a few ethnic cadres in the early days of liberation, and now there are more than 1,200 people; in the Honghe Hani-Yi Autonomous Prefecture, there were only more than 30 ethnic cadres in the early days of liberation, and now there are more than 3,800 people. The main cadres of the autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties are mostly cadres of their own ethnic group. The growth and development of ethnic cadres is very fast. Such a large number of minority ethnic cadres are the backbone for the ethnic minorities to exercise their autonomous rights and be the masters of their own affairs. It can be seen that the rumors of local nationalism have no factual basis. At the same time, experience has proven that it is very necessary to have a group of Han cadres to help work in minority ethnic areas. This is also an important aspect of the Han people helping the people of minority ethnic groups. The achievements of the various aspects of work in the minority ethnic areas are inseparable from this kind of assistance. This kind of assistance was needed in the past, is needed now, and will be needed in the future. The vast majority of Han cadres are good, closely contacting the masses, uniting ethnic cadres, and working honestly, and have won the trust and love of the people of minority ethnic groups, and some have even sacrificed their lives. Even if individual work styles are not good, or they take over and replace others, it can be corrected through rectification. The tendency to discriminate against and exclude Han cadres is not conducive to ethnic unity or the advancement of minority ethnic groups.

Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no liberation of all ethnic groups, and there would be no socialism. Without the establishment of Party organizations in the nature of the vanguard of the working class in all ethnic minorities, the socialist revolution cannot be realized, and without the growth of ethnic progressive forces, socialism cannot truly take root in minority ethnic areas.

Third, local nationalists viciously distort the nature of the Chinese Communist Party, attacking the Party's leadership and the Party's cadre policy. They say: "The Communist Party splits the ethnic group," advocating that Party organizations be divided according to ethnic components, and arrogantly advocating "the establishment of a certain ethnic Communist Party." Some people believe that "without the leadership of the Party committee, we can still walk our own way," "the Party committee's interference has only messed up our ethnic affairs." This kind of argument is obviously extremely absurd. The Chinese Communist Party is a unified party of the Chinese working class organized in accordance with the principles

    不反对地方民族主义就无法建设社会主义
    刀京版（傣族）刀有良（傣族）龙明传（侬族）刘荣显（彝族）余海清（彝族）李光华（拉祜族）李光荣（瑶族）李和才（哈尼族）李桂英（彝族）和万宝（纳西族）松谋（藏族）赵钟奇（回族）张冲（彝族）张子齐（白族）普照（彝族）雷春国（景颇族）熊开友（苗族）魏崖景（佧佤族）龚绶（傣族）的联合发言
    我们完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的各项报告。
    现在，我们就反对地方民族主义问题作一联合发言。
    在思想战线上，坚持无产阶级的民族观，彻底批判资产阶级民族主义，以进一步巩固民族团结，加速建设社会主义。
    云南在反动统治时期，各族人民毫无政治权利，经济文化极端贫困落后；各民族互相隔阂、歧视以至互相“拉事”、“打冤家”，往往弄得家破人亡，两败俱伤。随着人民革命的伟大胜利，才结束了这种悲惨的历史。几年来，在中国共产党的正确领导下，进行了一系列艰苦复杂的工作。各民族相互间，已建立起团结、友爱、互助的新关系。绝大多数少数民族已实行了区域自治；培养了大批的少数民族干部。内地四百万人口的少数民族地区已经基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造；边疆已有一百五十万人口的地区完成了和平协商土地改革，并稳步地开展了合作化运动；有六十万人口的直接过渡地区，亦已建立了四百多个农业生产合作社。各族人民的政治觉悟，日益提高，热爱共产党和毛主席，热爱祖国大家庭和社会主义事业。这些巨大的成就，已使各民族的面貌发生了根本性的变化，为社会主义的经济文化建设提供了新的基础和有利条件。当前的重要任务是：进一步巩固民族团结，为加速建设社会主义而奋斗。要保证这一伟大任务的顺利实现，在思想战线上，坚持无产阶级的民族观，彻底批判资产阶级民族主义，具有十分重要的意义。
    在新的斗争形势下，地方民族主义思想成了一种不容忽视的危险倾向。少数民族中一些野心分子乘着少数民族中社会主义的经济基础、阶级基础和思想基础都比较薄弱，社会主义制度还不巩固，披着民族的外衣，公开贩卖资本主义毒药。必须通过整风和社会主义教育，来提高少数民族群众和干部的社会主义觉悟，划清在民族问题上社会主义和资本主义的大是大非。
    民族主义同共产主义是绝不相容的。大民族主义和地方民族主义，都是资产阶级思想在民族问题上的表现，都不利于祖国的统一和团结，不利于社会主义建设，不利于各民族的繁荣和发展。几年来，党和政府不断教育汉族干部和汉族人民，大力地反对了大汉族主义，这对于实现民族平等，加强民族团结，推进各项社会改革，起了重大的作用。今后继续反对大汉族主义，仍然是思想战线上经常的任务。但是，应当指出：在新的斗争形势下，地方民族主义思想有了一定程度的滋长，有的相当严重，成了一种不容忽视的危险倾向。这是因为少数民族中已被消灭和将被消灭的剥削阶级，不甘心于自己的失败，它们中间的一些野心分子企图利用民族问题进行挣扎和抵抗。此外，前一时期，资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻，也曾在少数民族中发生了一些恶劣的影响；得到某些有着民族主义思想的人的共鸣。当然坚持地方民族主义的反动立场的分子，只是极少数；少数民族的广大人民群众，是拥护社会主义，热爱祖国，维护民族团结，要求共同前进的。但由于社会主义革命，是极为广泛极为深刻的革命斗争，不仅要最后消灭阶级，而且触及到人民群众生产、生活，以及传统习惯和心理状态等一切方面。历史上遗留下来的民族偏见和小私有者的习惯势力，尚未完全消除；少数民族工人阶级的基础还很薄弱，或者基本上还没有工人阶级，经济和文化，都还比较落后。而广大民族干部，大多数出身于非无产阶级，没有受过严格的革命锻炼和改造，许多人还没有建立起共产主义的世界观，缺乏社会主义的思想准备。总之，在云南各少数民族中，社会主义的经济基础，阶级基础和思想基础，都比较薄弱，社会主义制度还不巩固。由于这样，地方民族主义分子就在这里找到他们的活动市场。这些人披着民族的外衣，公开贩卖资本主义的毒药。我们必须通过整风和社会主义教育，来提高少数民族群众和干部的社会主义觉悟，划清在民族问题上社会主义和资本主义的大是大非，坚决克服地方民族主义思想。
    我们同地方民族主义有哪些根本分歧，必须进行什么斗争呢？
    在实行社会主义改革和开展合作化运动的时候，充分注意各民族发展的特点和风俗习惯，更好地把社会主义的基本原则同各民族的实际情况具体结合起来，把共同性和特殊性统一起来，以推动各民族经济文化向前发展。这样做的目的，是为了促进，而不是为了促退。
    第一，地方民族主义把社会主义的共同道路和社会主义的基本原则，同民族特点对立起来，把民族问题摆在第一位，借口民族特点或情况特殊，反对社会主义，反对必要的社会改革。认为“合作社只适合汉族，不适合少数民族”，“合作化后，民族特点不存在了”，“粮食统购统销破坏了我们民族的风俗习惯，搞掉了我们的民族特点”。这种说法，完全违反了客观真理。我们是马克思主义者，从来认为民族问题的实质是阶级问题，民族压迫的根源是阶级压迫。列宁说过：“资产阶级总是把自己的民族要求提在第一位，把它们提作绝对的东西；而无产阶级却认为民族要求应服从于阶级斗争利益”。这是无产阶级民族观与资产阶级民族观的根本区别。我国是无产阶级领导的国家，“指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义”（毛主席），全国各族人民的共同愿望和共同要求是要把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义共和国。这些道理，已在我国宪法中作了庄严的规定。从云南的实际情况说，正是由于党和政府认真执行了民族利益服从伟大的社会主义利益的根本原则，按照各民族的不同特点逐步实行了社会改革和社会主义改造，才使各民族相互关系和生产生活状况，起了根本的变化。以苦聪族为例，在反动统治时期，他们有五怕：“怕打、怕抓、怕杀、怕要粮、怕要款”，被迫逃到国境边沿的深山野箐里，过着十分贫困的原始生活，不敢下坝，不敢定居，经常迁移。靠几把残缺的砍刀和木棒，种植包谷与采集野生植物充饥；生了小孩，用芭蕉叶子包，十多岁的男女青年没有裤子穿。解放后，由于党和政府的大力扶持，由于其他民族的帮助和本民族人民的努力，离开了深山野箐，到半山区定居，有了农具和耕畜，逐步组织起来，发展了生产，创办了小学；培养了积极分子，有的参加了共产党和共青团的组织，参加了工作。这些事例，生动地证明了只有彻底消灭阶级压迫，才能从根本上解决民族问题。各少数民族地区，通过社会改革和互助合作运动，连年增产；而且增产的幅度大于汉族地区。去年，德宏傣族景颇族自治州和西双版纳傣族自治州的合作社，一般增产百分之十至二十，百分之九十以上的社员增加了收入。景洪的合作社社员，每人平均收入由一九五五年的五十八元二角上升为九十九元八角，有三分之一的原贫雇农的生产、生活已提高到一般中农的水平；勐混的曼养贯合作社员，平均每人收入粮食达二千七百斤，每户有八口猪，超过了当地富裕中农的水平。所以，少数民族广大农民，称合作社为“幸福桩”，为“毛主席送来的太阳”，编了这样的歌谣：“一块土基难砌墙，一根柱子难盖房；单干时候不够吃，办起社来有余粮”，这是亲身经验的正确总结。虽然合作化初期，会碰到若干困难，但少数民族农民并没有被吓倒，表示“吃干吃稀，都要干到底”，提出“一人一窍，十人一套，社会主义快来到”的口号，生产积极性空前高涨，目前正和汉族人民一道热火朝天地投入到兴修水利和积肥的高潮中。这些事实，粉碎了“合作社不适合少数民族”的谣言。当然，由于各少数民族有不同的历史条件，情况相当复杂，在实行社会改革和开展合作化运动的时候，必须充分注意各民族发展的特点和风俗习惯，采取适当的方式和步骤，更好地把社会主义的基本原则同各民族的实际情况具体地结合起来，把共同性和特殊性统一起来，以便更有效地开展工作，推动各民族经济文化向前发展；这样做的目的，是为了促进，而不是为了促退。
    对于民族特点和风俗习惯，要采取区别对待的态度。有利于本民族的繁荣和发展，有利于民族团结，有利于社会主义建设的，不仅受到尊重，而且得到保持和发扬；落后的民族特点和风俗习惯则应该根据本民族人民的自愿，逐步加以改革。
    所谓民族特点和风俗习惯，应当进行具体分析，看一看究竟是什么样的民族特点和什么样的风俗习惯，采取区别对待的态度。必须肯定：云南各少数民族人民，和汉族人民一样，在悠久的历史过程中，在生产生活的长期实践中，形成了不少优良的民族特点和风俗习惯。譬如勤劳勇敢，省吃俭用，富于智慧和创造精神；痛恨压迫剥削制度，热爱祖国和热爱本民族，要求进步发展，有优美的文化艺术传统；少数民族的妇女，和男子一样是生产能手，有的地方，还是主要劳动力。这些都是民族特点和风俗习惯中最主要的东西。这些东西有利于本民族的繁荣和发展，有利于各民族的团结，有利于社会主义建设；因此，不仅受到尊重，而且得到保持和发扬。但是，另一方面，毋庸讳言，由于长期的反动统治，由于旧社会制度和反动统治阶级的深刻影响，在所谓民族特点和风俗习惯中，也有若干落后的东西。譬如有的地方，刀耕火种，靠天吃饭；不信医药，迷信鬼神；有的甚至砍人头祭谷；这些当然不是主流，但它们妨害本民族的繁荣和发展，妨害各民族的团结，妨害社会主义建设，因此，根据本民族人民的自觉自愿，逐步地加以改革，是符合宪法的规定和人民群众的前进要求的。任何民族特点和风俗习惯，都是历史的产物，不是一成不变的。随着时代的发展和社会制度的变革，随着各民族政治、经济、文化的发展和思想意识的变化，以及各民族的相互影响，民族特点和风俗习惯，都会或快或慢或多或少地发生变化，逐步淘汰旧的落后的因素，增加新的进步的因素，这是必然的趋势，也是可喜的现象。地方民族主义者所谓合作化和粮食统购统销政策破坏了民族特点和风俗习惯的谬论，是经不住批驳的。难道说，封建剥削制度和小生产者的私有制，粮食的自由市场和投机倒把等等，是少数民族固有的特点和风俗习惯吗？恰恰相反，这种旧制度是少数民族人民群众贫困落后的重要根源。因此，采取适当的方式和步骤，逐步改变这种旧制度，正是各少数民族上升为社会主义民族所必需的，从而获得了广大人民群众的拥护。
    任何民族如果离开祖国大家庭，离开中央的统一领导，就一定会离开社会主义的康庄大道，回复到被压迫被奴役的老路。为了求得共同的繁荣和发展，就必须加强各民族间的团结互助，特别是少数民族和汉族的团结。少数民族离开汉族人民的帮助就不可能单独向前发展。
    第二，地方民族主义者，伪装代表民族利益，企图离间各民族与祖国的关系，破坏祖国的统一，制造分裂，说什么“没有国家的帮助，我们民族自己也可以发展”，“生在中国不自由，还不如生在半殖民地国家”，甚至狂妄到要成立“某民族共和国”。在民族关系上，保守排外，企图“单干”，反对民族间的团结互助，把党和政府根据各民族不同的发展水平而采取的具体措施诬蔑为“厚此薄彼”，“待遇不平等”；把移民开发边疆诬蔑为“汉人来占我们的地方”；把历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂夸大为“不容易调和的鸿沟”；把社会主义前进中各民族间的相互接触相互影响和相互融合的进步现象诬蔑为“文明的同化和消灭”，把汉族和少数民族的关系诬蔑为“狼和羊的关系”，“过去受汉族压迫，现在还是受汉族压迫”。这样论调的反动性质，是显而易见的。我国各族人民在中国共产党的领导下，经过长期的艰苦奋斗，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利，建立了统一的中华人民共和国，从而使民族关系发生了根本变化，结束了民族压迫制度，贯彻执行了民族平等的原则，发扬了各民族间的友爱互助，这是有目共睹的事实。云南各少数民族根据自己的切身体验，深切了解到：各民族只有在统一的祖国大家庭之内，在中央的统一领导之下，才能共同建设社会主义社会，使各民族都得到繁荣和发展。任何民族如果离开了祖国大家庭，离开了中央的统一领导，就一定会离开社会主义的康庄大道，回复到被压迫被奴役的老路。同时，为了求得共同的繁荣和发展，就必须加强各民族间的团结互助，特别是少数民族和汉族的团结。汉族在我们国家内，人口众多，政治、经济、文化比较发展，居于主导地位，在云南也是如此。少数民族离开了汉族的帮助，就不可能单独地向前发展。各少数民族人民群众和绝大多数民族干部，深切了解民族团结的重要，热烈欢迎汉族人民和汉族干部的帮助。地方民族主义者为了达到破坏祖国统一和民族团结，还在民族区域自治问题上，借口自治权利和自治机关民族化，排斥外来干部，硬说“外来干部妨碍民族自治权的实现”，主张“自治州一切职务都要本民族的人担任，才算民族化”，“只有本民族干部，才能为本民族服务”；甚至叫嚷“少数民族自治，汉族当家作主”和右派分子龙云一鼻孔出气。大家知道，我国宪法所规定的民族区域自治政策，是根据马克思、列宁主义关于民族问题的理论，结合我国的历史发展和实际情况而决定的政策，几年来的事实充分证明了这个政策的正确。自治机关的民族化必须服从于国家政权的性质，这是实现各民族自治权利最根本的问题。民族化就是通过运用民族形式，使用民族语言，任用民族干部来体现工人阶级的领导，体现工农联盟。民族化的目的是为了更好地发挥各少数民族人民的政治积极性和劳动热情，更紧密地团结在祖国大家庭内，为共同建设社会主义而奋斗。干部的民族化首先也必须是干部的社会主义化，绝不能理解为“清一色”。“清一色”的思想，不只妨碍自治机关联系群众，妨害集思广益，而且发展下去，必然要落入政治野心分子制造民族分裂，破坏国家统一的罪恶圈套。地方民族主义者歪曲说党不重视少数民族干部，说民族干部太少了，有职无权，实际情况绝非如此。云南解放以来，在党和政府的大力培养下，少数民族干部从无到有，从少到多。所有民族地区的乡村基层组织已经基本上都由本民族的干部担负领导工作；在区以上各级领导机关中，有二万七千多个少数民族干部担负或参加领导工作。西双版纳傣族自治州，解放初期只有几个民族干部，现在已有一千二百多人；红河哈尼族彝族自治州，解放初期只有民族干部三十多人，现在已有三千八百多人。各自治州自治县的主要干部绝大多数都是本民族干部。民族干部的成长和发展都是很快的。这样大批的少数民族干部，是各少数民族行使自治权利，当家作主的骨干。足见地方民族主义的谰言，是毫无事实根据的。同时，经验证明：有一批汉族干部在少数民族地区帮助工作是十分必要的。这也是汉族人民帮助少数民族人民的一个重要方面。少数民族地区各方面工作的成就是和这种帮助分不开的。这种帮助，过去需要，现在需要，将来也需要。绝大多数汉族干部是好的，密切联系群众，团结民族干部，老老实实工作，获得了少数民族人民的信任和爱护，有的甚至献出了生命。即使个别作风不好，包办代替，也是通过整风，可以纠正的。那种歧视和排斥汉族干部的倾向，是既不利于民族团结，又不利于少数民族的向前发展的。
    没有共产党的领导，就没有各民族的解放，就没有社会主义。在各少数民族中没有按照工人阶级先锋队的性质建立党的组织，就不能实现社会主义革命，没有民族进步力量的生长，社会主义就不可能在少数民族地区真正生根。
    第三、地方民族主义者，恶毒地歪曲了中国共产党的性质，攻击党的领导和党的干部政策。说：“共产党分裂民族”，主张按照民族成份来划分党的组织，狂妄地主张“成立某民族共产党”。有的认为“没有党委领导，我们也一样会自己走路”，“党委对我们的干涉反而把我们民族的事情弄坏了”。这种论调，显然是极端荒谬的。中国共产党是按照马克思、列宁主义原则组织起来的中国工人阶级统一的政党，是我国各族人民利益的代表者，是团结和领导各民族人民争取解放和建设社会主义的核心力量。没有共产党的领导，或者削弱了这种领导，就没有各民族的解放，就没有社会主义，就没有各民族的亲密合作，一句话，“没有共产党就没有新中国”，因此，也就没有各民族人民的繁荣和发展，这已是全国各族人民公认的一条真理。地方民族主义者对于少数民族中的党员和靠拢党的干部，采取极端仇视的态度，骂他们是“汉族的走狗，民族叛徒、忘本、欺骗祖宗”。“是为了个人升官发财，为了名誉地位，是一些不顾自己民族利益和出卖自己民族的人”。诬蔑党对民族干部进行阶级教育，是“从思想上瓦解分裂我们民族”等等。充分表露了少数民族中已被消灭和将被消灭的剥削阶级的仇恨心理。大家知道，各少数民族的向前发展，必须是在党的统一领导下，充分发挥各民族自己的力量；如果没有大批的民族成份的共产主义干部，没有在各个少数民族中按照工人阶级先锋队的性质建立党的组织，要在民族区实现社会主义革命是不可能的。几年来，党这样做了，大批民族干部和党员、团员，同汉族干部、党员、团员团结在一起，在联系本民族群众，完成各项改革，推动民族区的经济、文化建设的发展等方面，起了应有的作用。同时，他们在党的教育下，和各项实际工作中受到了不同程度的锻炼，成为各民族继续前进的重要力量，为广大人民群众所爱护。民族的敌人很清楚：没有民族进步力量的生长并取得领导优势，社会主义就不可能在少数民族中真正生根。一切剥削阶级要实现反动复辟，就一定要保持民族内部的贫困落后，仇视进步力量。他们对民族干部和党团员进行恶毒攻击，造谣诬蔑，其用心和目的是很显然的。所有民族干部和党团员必须进一步提高阶级觉悟和政治警惕，维护党的领导，更紧密团结本民族群众，倾听群众的呼声、希望和意愿。起好骨干作用，大力培养民族的先进力量，克服不利于民族发展的落后因素，不断领导群众前进，更好地建设社会主义。
    批判地方民族主义时，应当把民族感情同民族主义加以区别，把有一般民族偏见、民族主义情绪的人同个别坚持反动立场的民族主义分子和个人野心家加以严格区别。
    上述情况，表明了在云南认真地批判和克服地方民族主义，具有十分迫切而重要的意义。毛主席曾经指示：“无论是大汉族主义或者地方民族主义，都不利于各族人民的团结，这是应当克服的一种人民内部的矛盾”。根据这一指示的精神，在批判地方民族主义时，不只应当把民族感情和民族主义加以区别，而且应当把有着一般民族偏见和民族主义情绪的人同个别坚持反动立场的民族主义分子和个人野心家加以严格区别。在批判地方民族主义思想时，应采取团结——批评——团结的方式，达到多数人提高觉悟，明辨是非。我们相信，依靠党的正确领导，依靠各民族领导骨干的自觉，依靠各民族人民群众的监督，一定能够通过整风运动和社会主义教育，胜利地完成这一思想斗争任务。
