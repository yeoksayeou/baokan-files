    Our Routine
    Zhang Chunqiao
    Perhaps it's because I was a newspaper editor for a few days. These days, whenever I open the newspaper and see the torrents of the new socialist life and the new leaps forward, I always think of the joy of the night shift editors.
    The best news, before the readers see it, the editors see it first, of course. On a spring night in 1949, when the people in Jiangnan were waiting for dawn and the people north of the river were waiting for good news, "The Yangtze River is calm, our army's ten thousand ships are sailing, heading straight for the other shore. In less than twenty-four hours, 300,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers broke through the enemy's defenses and occupied a vast area of the south bank"? This news of the crossing had already reached the editorial department. From that day on, until the founding of the People's Republic of China, good news flew in like snowflakes, and there wasn't even time to publish extra editions. In January 1956, during those happy days when the three major transformations of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce were basically completed, the night shift editorial office was boiling again. In days of such great leaps forward, being an editor is often both happy and difficult. These days before us, the heroic momentum of hundreds of millions of people riding the waves and making great leaps forward will bring editors even greater joy and difficulty. The joy goes without saying, but the difficulty is: using the most accurate, vivid, and clear language to praise the victory of the people. This is originally the greatest and truest happiness for our writers, but at this time we feel particularly aware of the poverty of language. However, this kind of difficulty often becomes a force for those ambitious writers, arousing their strong creative desire. When they rack their brains and create a good introduction, a good headline, that is truly the greatest pleasure, and our newspapers also have new leaps forward along with the torrent of life.
    This situation is something that we, as readers, can also see and think of.
    I think that this creative desire to overcome difficulties, this development trend from one leap forward to another, is not only found in the life of the night shift editor, but is seen every day in our great socialist revolution. I even want to say that this is the norm of our lives. What happens in the editorial department is just a reflection of social life.
    However, in actual life, there is also another kind of person with another kind of routine. Hundreds of millions of people are cheering for leaps forward, leaps forward, and more leaps forward! Some people are just stepping on their right foot, muttering the routine, the routine, the third routine! In their view, the socialist revolution should be calm and tranquil, as long as they go to work and get off work as usual, approve documents as usual, eat as usual, sleep as usual, everything as usual, then everything is as usual. The socialist revolution becomes "as usual," and it is said that this is called the routine. They don't want to take a step at all, but when they do, they always have a lot of things to pay attention to, like an old-fashioned teacher in a private school, specializing in walking with an eight-character step, for fear of stepping on an ant. If someone actually steps on an ant, then it is "rash advance," then it is "terrible," "a disaster"! Isn't it said that we should learn from the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains? Very good, then let's do it slowly with one hoe and one shovel at a time, anyway, there are still future generations, moving it down generation after generation, "Grind a steel beam into a needle, success comes naturally with effort." The heroic image of the Foolish Old Man has changed in their eyes, leaving only this old, decrepit, and stumbling appearance. If they just handle things according to their own routines, that would be fine, but they also want everyone to follow their department, stay in their class, and if anyone does a little more work, they will say that this is "fond of great achievements," and even "take care of everything" for future generations.
    Fortunately, not so many people believe in their set of routines. They also have no way to lock the hands and feet of hundreds of millions of people with their routines one by one. The socialist enthusiasm hidden in the masses is endless. Like an atomic nucleus, before it is opened, it is silent, as if it has no power at all, and it can be handled completely according to the "routine." However, once the socialist enthusiasm of the masses is ignited by communist thought, endless chain reactions occur, "Eight hundred million, eight hundred million, and another eight hundred million!" Isn't this the voice of the people on both sides of the Huai River? "Leap forward, leap forward, and another leap forward!" Isn't this the voice of the people across the country? At this time, the stumbling, old, and decrepit routine old man shouting "routine!" a few times is useless. Revolution is a leap forward, revolution is making rapid progress according to its own routine.
    This is certainly not to say that the routine old man has no companions. There are also three or five of his good friends in our team. In our minds, we can still hear his voice from time to time, and it still affects some of us. Even today, during the great leap forward of the socialist revolution, we can still hear the routine old man whispering, "When the time comes, you will have to review your rash advance!" We say: The era of living according to the old routine is over. Haven't you heard this passage?
    "Human development has taken hundreds of thousands of years, and in China, only now have we obtained the conditions to develop our economy and culture according to plan. Since we have obtained this condition, the face of our country will change year by year. Every five years will have a relatively large change, and several five years will have a larger change."
    Don't you like "routine"? This is the routine of our lives. Our people have seen their future clearly for the first time, seen their great future, therefore, their revolutionary enthusiasm is so great, and they are working so hard to leap forward. If you must insist on walking according to your routine, I am afraid that you will not even be able to hear us "review the rash advance." Therefore, even for the sake of hearing our "review," I advise you to break your routine and catch up quickly!

### 我们的常规

    我们的常规
    张春桥
    也许是当过几天报纸编辑的关系，这几天，每当打开报纸，看到千百万条社会主义新生活的奔流，又有了新的跃进的时候，总是想到夜班编辑的快乐。
    最好的消息，在读者没有看到以前，编辑当然先看到。1949年的一个春夜里，当江南的人们都在等待着天亮、江北的人们伫守着捷报的时候，“长江风平浪静，我军万船齐放，直取对岸，不到二十四小时，三十万人民解放军即已突破敌阵，占领南岸广大地区”?这条渡江新闻，已经到达编辑部了，从这天起，直到中华人民共和国成立，好消息真像雪片飞来，出号外都来不及。1956年1月，对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的三大改造基本完成的那些欢乐的日子里，夜班编辑室又是沸腾起来了。碰到这种大跃进的日子，当编辑的，往往是又高兴，又困难。我们眼前的这些日子，几万万人乘风破浪大跃进的英雄气势，给编辑带来的，会是更高兴，更困难。高兴不用说了，困难是：用最准确、最生动、最鲜明的语言，来歌颂人民的胜利，这本来是我们文字工作者的最大的真正的幸福，这时却特别感到语言的贫乏。但是，这种困难，对那些有志气的文字工作者，往往成了一种力量，激起他们强烈的创造欲望，当他们挖空心思，创造出一个好的导语、一个好的标题的时候，那真是最大的愉快，而我们的报纸，也随着生活的奔流有了新的跃进。
    这种情况，是我们作读者的也看得到、想得到的。
    我想，这种战胜困难的创造欲望，这种从一个跃进到一个跃进的发展形势，不只在夜班编辑生活中有，在我们社会主义的大革命中，更是天天看得到的。我甚至想说，这是我们生活的常规。编辑部所发生的，只不过是社会生活的反映。
    但是，在实际生活中，还有另外一种人的另外一种常规。几万万人欢呼着跃进、跃进、再跃进！有些人却只在那里踏着右脚，念念有词地默诵着常规、常规、第三个常规！在他们看来，社会主义革命，应当是风平浪静的，只要照例上班下班，照例批批公文，照例吃饭，照例睡觉，一切照例，也就一切照常，社会主义革命变成“照常”，据说，这才叫常规。他们也不是一步不想走，但是，走起路来，总要有很多讲究，像私塾里的老夫子一样，专门迈八字步，生怕一脚踩着一只蚂蚁。如果有谁果然踩着一只蚂蚁，那就是“冒进”了，那就“不得了”、“糟透了”！不是说要学习愚公移山吗？好得很，那就一镢头、一铲子地慢慢来吧，反正还有后世子孙呢，一代一代地移下去，“钢梁磨绣针，功到自然成”。愚公的英雄形象，到了他们的眼睛里，也变了样子，只剩下这么一个老态龙钟、步履维艰的样儿了。如果他们只是自己这么按自己的常规办事，还算罢了，他们还要所有的人都按他们的部、就他们的班，谁如果多做了一点事，他们还会说这是“好大喜功”，连后代子孙的事，也“包办代替”了。
    幸好他们的这一套常规，信奉的人还没有那么多。他们也没有办法把几万万人的手脚都用他们的常规一一锁住。人民群众中蕴藏着的社会主义积极性是无穷无尽的。像原子核一样，当它还没有被打开以前，它是无声无息的，好像一点力量也没有，完全可以按“常规”办事。但是，当人民群众的社会主义积极性，一旦被共产主义思想燃烧起来的时候，无穷无尽的连锁反应就发生了，“八亿，八亿，再八亿！”这不是淮河两岸人民的声音吗？“跃进，跃进，再跃进！”这不是全国人民的声音吗？这时候，步履维艰、老态龙钟的常规老人，再喊几声“常规！”也没有用了。革命就是跃进，革命是按照它自己的常规突飞猛进的。
    这当然不是说，常规老人就没有了伴侣。在我们队伍里也还有他的三五好友。在我们的脑子里，有时也还有他的声音，还影响我们一些人。就是在今天社会主义革命大跃进的时候，我们也还可以听到常规老人的窃窃私语，“到时候你们又要检讨冒进的！”我们说：按照旧的常规过日子的时代过去了。你没有听过这一段话吗？
    “人类的发展有了几十万年，在中国这个地方，直到现在方才取得了按照计划发展自己的经济和文化的条件。自从取得了这个条件，我国的面目就将一年一年地起变化。每一个五年将有一个较大的变化，积几个五年将有一个更大的变化。”?
    你不是喜欢“常规”吗？这就是我们生活的常规。我们的人民第一次清楚地看到了自己的将来，看见了自己的伟大的前途，因此，革命干劲才这样足，才这样努力地向前跃进。如果你一定要坚持按你的常规走路，恐怕连听我们“到时候检讨冒进”也望尘莫及了。因此，就是为了听我们“检讨”，我劝你也还是打破你的常规，快些跟上来吧！
