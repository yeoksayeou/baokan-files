Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, February 24th: President Nasser of the United Arab Republic arrived here this morning. He was accompanied by Baghdadi, Speaker of the Egyptian National Assembly, Sadat, Deputy Speaker, and Marshal Amir, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United Arab Republic.

According to local newspapers, Nasser's visit here is aimed at establishing an executive committee for the Syrian region. He will also discuss the interim National Assembly and the central government of the United Arab Republic with Syrian figures.

President Nasser immediately went to the Kuwatly residence upon arrival. Tens of thousands of Damascus residents gathered at the Kuwatly residence to cheer Nasser. President Nasser stood on the balcony of the Kuwatly residence to thank the people for their welcome and delivered a brief speech. He said, "I have always regarded Damascus as the heart of Arabism. The model of Arab nationalism was established in this city." Nasser also praised Kuwatly's contribution to the Arab nationalist movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, February 24th: President Nasser of the United Arab Republic said in Damascus on the 24th that after the establishment of the United Arab Republic, "we must still defend our goals with our last drop of blood. These goals are: to fight for active neutrality, non-alignment, opposition to military treaties, and freedom from foreign influence."

Nasser told nearly 50,000 Damascus residents who had gathered at his residence to cheer him that the people of Syria and Egypt share common views and have been fighting for common goals. "Conspiracies, psychological warfare, cold war, economic war, and even armed aggression cannot defeat us, because we believe in our goals, believe in the tasks we must accomplish, and believe in our freedom and dignity."

Nasser said: "I am looking today for those who talk about a vacuum, but I do not see anyone like that. What I see here is our Arab people who are fighting for national independence and have filled the vacuum."

Nasser also said that the Syrian and Egyptian people had waged arduous struggles and made great sacrifices to achieve victory, and now the day has come when everyone believes that imperialism and its agents in our country are finished. This day will prove to the whole world that the Arabs are determined not to be ruled by foreigners or aggressors.

Nasser said that the responsibility on your shoulders and my shoulders is great, because this responsibility is to build our republic and defend it from control and aggression. We must work simultaneously in both the political and social fields so that every resident of our United Arab Republic can enjoy happiness and progress. Nasser added that in order to achieve this goal, we must be united, because by relying on unity, we can repel the aggression against Port Said; by relying on unity, we can defeat the great powers, defeat their armies, fleets, and air forces; and it is also by relying on unity that we can defeat conspiracies, psychological warfare, cold war, and economic war; and by relying on unity, we can achieve victory and establish the United Arab Republic.

Nasser said that we have achieved these goals according to your will, not according to the will of foreign countries. Nasser concluded: "In order to achieve these (foreign policy) goals, in order to make the country a strong power where everyone enjoys political dignity and social justice, our country needs the efforts of each and every one of you and your unity."

Mass demonstrations marched in the streets until the evening, chanting slogans against imperialism and cheering President Nasser and the United Arab Republic.

    纳赛尔宣布阿拉伯联合共和国外交政策
    坚守积极中立　反对帝国主义
    据新华社大马士革24日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔今天上午到达这里。陪同他到达的有埃及国民议会议长巴格达迪、副议长萨达特和阿拉伯联合共和国武装部队总司令阿密尔元帅。
    据这里报纸报道，纳赛尔到这里访问的目的是要成立叙利亚地区的执行委员会。他还将同叙利亚人士讨论临时国民议会和阿拉伯联合共和国中央政府问题。
    纳赛尔总统在到达后立即前往库阿特利官邸。成千上万的大马士革居民聚集在库阿特利官邸向纳赛尔欢呼。纳赛尔总统站在库阿特利官邸的阳台上感谢人们的欢迎，并且发表了简短的讲话。他说，“我一向把大马士革视为阿拉伯主义的心脏，阿拉伯民族主义的榜样就是从这个城市树立起来的。”纳赛尔还赞誉了库阿特利对阿拉伯民族主义运动的贡献。
    新华社大马士革24日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔24日在大马士革说，在阿拉伯联合共和国成立之后，“我们仍然要用我们的最后一滴血来保卫我们的目标，这些目标就是：要为积极中立、不参加集团、反对军事条约、不受外国的影响而斗争”。
    纳赛尔对聚集在他住处向他欢呼的将近五万大马士革居民说：叙利亚和埃及人民有着共同的看法，并且一直在为着共同的目标而斗争。“阴谋、神经战、冷战、经济战、甚至武装侵略都不能打败我们，因为我们相信自己的目标，相信自己所必须完成的任务，相信自己的自由和尊严。”
    纳赛尔说：“我今天正在寻找那些谈论真空的人，但是我没有看到任何这样的人。我在这里看到的只有为民族独立而斗争并且填补了真空的我们阿拉伯人民。”
    纳赛尔还说，叙利亚和埃及人民为了取得胜利曾经进行了艰苦的斗争，作了很大的牺牲，现在到了大家认为帝国主义及其在我们国家内的代理人已经完蛋的日子。这个日子将向全世界证明，阿拉伯人是坚决不肯受外国人或侵略者统治的。
    纳赛尔说，你们的双肩和我的双肩上所负的责任是重大的，因为这个责任是要建设我们的共和国并且保卫它不受控制和侵略。我们必须在政治和社会两方面同时进行工作，以便使我们阿拉伯联合共和国中的每个居民得到幸福和进步。纳赛尔又说，为了达到这个目的，我们必须团结一致，因为依靠团结，我们才能击退对塞得港的侵略，依靠团结，我们能够打败大国，打败它们的陆军、舰队和空军；也是依靠了团结，才能击败阴谋、神经战、冷战和经济战；依靠团结，才能够取得胜利和建立阿拉伯联合共和国。
    纳赛尔说，我们达到这些目的是按照了你们的意志，而不是按照外国的意志。纳赛尔最后说：“为了达到这些（外交政策的）目的，为了使国家成为一个使人人获得政治尊严和社会公平的强国，我们国家需要你们每一个人的努力和你们的团结。”
    群众示威队伍在街上游行直到晚间，队伍中高呼反对帝国主义和欢呼纳赛尔总统和阿拉伯联合共和国的口号。
