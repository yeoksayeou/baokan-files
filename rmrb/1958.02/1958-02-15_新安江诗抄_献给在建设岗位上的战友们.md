Xin'an River Poems
    ——Dedicated to Our Comrades on the Construction Post
    Cai Qingsheng

    Survey Team Leader
    It's late! It's late!
    Where has our team leader gone?
    An empty bed is left in the work shed,
    Where is he sleeping tonight?
    This afternoon the water level rose rapidly,
    The drilling machine can no longer continue drilling,
    He's guarding the machine, hoping the water level will drop,
    A long night spent worrying about the task.

    Designer
    You often stop eating,
    Girl, these days
    Why are you feeling uneasy?
    Why is your appetite poor?
    You stay up late at night,
    And often wake up in the middle of the night,
    For an inch of line on the blueprint, girl,
    You seem to be sick.

    Safety Officer
    The alarm has sounded twice,
    Red flags are waving left and right on the mountain,
    The blasting cannon is about to roar,
    Pedestrians on the road have stopped coming and going.
    The safety officer is carrying a red flag,
    Patrolling the edge of the restricted area,
    To ensure the safety of others,
    He works in the most dangerous place.

    新安江诗抄
    ——献给在建设岗位上的战友们

    勘测队长
    夜深啦！夜深啦！
    咱们的队长那里去了？
    工棚里留了个空床位，
    今夜他在那里睡觉？
    下午水位急速上升，
    钻探机不能继续钻进，
    他守着机器盼水位下降，
    漫漫长夜在为任务担心。
    设计员
    吃饭时常把筷子停下，
    姑娘，这几天
    你为啥心情不宁？
    你为啥食欲不振？
    晚上迟迟不睡，
    半夜常常惊醒，
    为了蓝图上的一寸线姑娘，
    你像得了病。
    安全员
    警报器已经响了两遍，
    红旗在山头左右摇摆，
    开山炮马上就要轰鸣，
    路上行人已断绝往来。
    安全员带着一面红旗，
    巡逻在警戒区的边缘，
    为了保证别人的安全，
    他工作的地方最危险。
