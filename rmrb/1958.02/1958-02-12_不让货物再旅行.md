    Preventing Goods From Traveling Again
    Our Harbin Electric Machinery Plant can currently only produce motors. The switches and other control equipment on the motors are supplied by Shanghai and Shenyang. However, when our plant supplies motor equipment to users in Shanghai and Shenyang, we also supply them as complete sets, just like we do for other places. Thus, a strange phenomenon occurs: a trainload of machines shipped from Shanghai and Shenyang is unloaded, and then a trainload is loaded and shipped back to the original place. Year after year, how much of the country's funds is being wasted!

    不让货物再旅行
    我们哈尔滨电机厂目前只能生产电机，电机上的开关等控制设备都是由上海、沈阳两地供应。但是，我厂给上海、沈阳用户供应电机设备时，像对其他地方一样，也是成套供应。于是，怪现象就发生了：从上海、沈阳运来的一车皮一车皮的机器刚卸下来，又一车皮一车皮地装上运回原地去。长年累月这样下去，要浪费国家多少资金啊！
