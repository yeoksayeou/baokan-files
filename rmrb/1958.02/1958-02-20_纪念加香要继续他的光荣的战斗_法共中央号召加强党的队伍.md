Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 18th:

    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party, in memory of Marcel Cachin, an outstanding activist of the French Communist Party and the international workers' movement, issued a battle call to strengthen the party ranks. The call stated: The French people mourn Cachin's passing. However, to commemorate him, greater efforts must be made, and the struggle for which he dedicated his glorious life must be continued and strengthened with renewed vigor. The struggle must be better waged to force the realization of peace in Algeria, to force the implementation of a policy of easing international tensions, and to achieve disarmament. The struggle must be better waged to defend the workers' bread, the peasants' land, to safeguard the future of children, to uphold the influence of our culture, and the happiness of the youth. We must strive to achieve the united action of Communist and Socialist workers, which Cachin never forgot in his lifetime, and which is always the guarantee of tomorrow's victory.

    Cachin's ideal in 1920 has become a reality. We must continue and develop the work he devoted his life to. The Central Committee appeals to the young men and women who are the vanguards of tomorrow's socialist society, to the workers in enterprises who hold the future of France, to the urban and rural laborers who pursue a better life, to the women of France—to all those people who constitute this great force of renewal in whom Cachin had faith in his lifetime. The Central Committee calls on everyone to actively participate in the ranks of the French Communist Party. Cachin has passed away, let tens of thousands of young French men and women join us to raise the communist banner that Cachin has steadfastly held high for forty years!

    纪念加香要继续他的光荣的战斗
    法共中央号召加强党的队伍
    新华社巴黎18日电　法国共产党中央委员会为了追念法国共产党和国际工人运动的杰出活动家马赛尔·加香，发出了加强党的队伍的战斗号召。号召说：法国人民哀悼加香的逝世。但是，为了追念他，就必须作出更大的努力，必须再接再厉地继续和加强他为之献出了他的光荣的一生的战斗。必须更好地进行斗争来迫使在阿尔及利亚实现和平、迫使实行缓和国际局势的政策和实现裁军。必须更好地进行斗争以保卫工人的面包、农民的土地，维护儿童的将来、维护我国文化的影响和青年的幸福。必须争取实现加香生前时刻不忘的共产党和社会党劳动者的一致行动，这始终是明天的胜利的保证。
    加香在1920年时的理想已经变成事实。必须继续和发展他一生所从事的工作。中央委员会向作为明天的社会主义社会的先锋的青年男女、向法国前途所寄的企业工人们、向追求美好的生活的城乡劳动者、向法国的妇女们——向加香生前对之有信心的构成这支巨大革新力量的所有的人们，发出呼吁。中央委员会号召大家积极地参加法国共产党的队伍。加香已经与世长辞了，让成千成万的法国青年男女们，同我们一道来举起加香四十年来曾经坚定不移地高举着的共产主义旗帜！
