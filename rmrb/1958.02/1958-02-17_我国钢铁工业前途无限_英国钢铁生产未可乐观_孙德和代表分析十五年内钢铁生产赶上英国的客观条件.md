I fully endorse Vice Premier Li's report on the implementation of the 1957 state budget and the draft 1958 state budget, and Vice Premier Bo's report on the draft 1958 national economic plan. I also fully endorse Vice Chairman Peng's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on language reform work and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme.

The reports point out that in 1957, the Chinese people achieved unprecedented great victories on the basis of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle. The victories on the socialist revolution's political and ideological fronts brought about victories on the economic front, and great achievements were made in national economic work. At the same time, the victories on the economic front also consolidated the victories on the political and ideological fronts. This political movement, through great debates, shattered the bourgeois rightists' conspiracy to restore capitalism, launched a sharp class struggle between the two roads, and vigorously promoted the ideological transformation of intellectuals. In this vigorous and practical class struggle, most intellectuals' ideological and class consciousness was raised in the furnace of revolutionary fire. This should be a tremendous victory in the socialist revolution. The 1958 plan truly reflects the superiority of China's political system and the strength and infinite wisdom of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party. The plan considers all possible positive factors in our country, enabling China's socialist industry and agriculture to advance simultaneously, embarking on a new high tide of industrial and agricultural construction in the first year of the second five-year plan. We will strive to greet this year's work tasks with unparalleled joy and excitement, and strive to overfulfill the plan. We will resolutely further develop construction work better starting from the 600 million population, better carry forward the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift, and launch a struggle against waste to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

As a worker in the ferrous metallurgical industry, facing the rising sun of socialist construction, we have indescribable excitement and joy. We have the opportunity to engage in the extremely glorious and great cause that Chairman Mao said predecessors have never done before. Especially under the call of the Party Central Committee and our beloved Chairman Mao, we are to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important products in fifteen years or a little longer. We wholeheartedly rejoice in undertaking such a glorious and huge task. We will be severely tested and tempered. We have firm confidence that we can complete the glorious and arduous task entrusted to us by the Party to this generation of metallurgical workers. We will not bow to difficulties, and we must complete this task tenaciously and excellently. Now I will analyze some objective conditions to prove our belief.

    The Glorious First Five Years

    We achieved an unprecedented growth rate in steel, with an annual increase of 31% for steel and 41% for iron. It is possible to reach a level of 40 million tons in about twelve years.

(1) China's steel production in the first five-year plan increased from 1.35 million tons in 1952 to 5.24 million tons in 1957. This is an unprecedented growth rate, a miracle that can only occur in socialist countries due to the superiority of the socialist system. It is impossible in capitalist countries. The growth of steel in the first five years was 389%, that is, an increase of 3.89 times, with an annual increase of 31%. The planned growth for 1958 is 19.2%. The growth of pig iron in the first five years was 560%, with an annual increase of 41%, and the planned growth for 1958 is 24.1%. It is conceivable that the victories on the political and ideological fronts in the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle will bring a new high tide of production enthusiasm formed by the improvement of ideological awareness among ferrous metallurgical workers. This enthusiasm will actively break through quotas and overfulfill plans. Assuming that we can consistently maintain a growth coefficient of 120%, we may be able to reach a level of 40 million tons in approximately ten years. Calculated from 1958, it is possible to reach a production level of 40 million tons roughly in 1969 or 1970. Completing such a huge task cannot be explained by simple calculations. We must further analyze the material basis in all aspects.

    Britain's Future Not Optimistic

    Although Britain developed its steel industry earlier, its speed has been very slow for a long time. The original plan was to reach 28.5 million tons of steel by 1962, but the capitalist system itself contains crises and is also restricted by domestic and foreign markets, raw material shortages, and insufficient investment. It is difficult to achieve the imagined results.

(2) Britain is a country that developed its steel industry earlier and is an old-brand imperialist country. Its steel production was later surpassed by the Soviet Union and the United States, and after the war, it was surpassed by West Germany in 1955, now ranking fourth in the world. The development of the British steel industry has been restricted by the production relations of the capitalist system, the threat of repeated wars and economic crises, and the influence of markets, etc., and has been very slow for a long time. The annual pig iron production in Britain is roughly as follows: Before World War I, the highest was 10.42 million tons in 1913, and then it dropped to the range of 8 to 9 million tons. It never exceeded this number before World War II. It was not until 1952 that it recovered to 10.9 million tons, and in 1955 it was roughly 12.67 million tons, and in 1956 it reached 13.38 million tons. The annual steel production in Britain is roughly as follows: 5 million tons in 1900, 9.87 million tons in 1917, and declined after the war. In 1929, it recovered to 9.79 million tons, 13.2 million tons in 1937 (on the eve of the war), and 16.6 million tons in 1950. It was not until after 1951 that there was some continued growth, reaching roughly 20.99 million tons in 1956. In 1957, the British authorities planned to increase steel production by 4.24%, increasing it by 39.4% during the eight years from 1954 to 1962. According to this estimate, they hope to reach 28.5 to 29 million tons in 1962. In addition to the influence of crises and depressions inherent in the capitalist system, there are the following serious difficulties for Britain to reach a steel ingot production of 28.5 million tons in 1962. ① Restrictions of domestic and foreign markets. It is doubtful whether the needs of domestic and foreign markets can develop according to their imagination. The plan also includes an export volume of approximately 5 million tons. Now the internal struggles of imperialism are very fierce, and whether it can be realized is also a problem. ② Insufficient resources, especially the prospective reserves of domestic iron ore are only 3.8 billion tons, with an iron content of only about 21% to 30%. Due to the difficulty in supplying scrap steel, pig iron production must be increased to about 19.9 million tons in 1962. At present, the amount of rich ore imported annually is very large. Calculated by iron content, 53.5% was imported in 1955 and 60% was imported in 1956, approximately 12 million tons. It is estimated that if the expected figures are to be reached, 22.4 million tons of rich iron ore and manganese ore must be imported from remote distances. Including from South America, Central American islands, West Africa, Norway, Sweden, North Africa, etc. According to estimates from other European countries, increasing the import of 10 million tons of rich ore will mean increasing the total tonnage of 700,000 tons of seagoing freighters and the necessary port loading and unloading facilities and investment in the development of mineral resources. Moreover, these resources are plundered from weak countries, and the sharp contradiction with the increasing nationalism after World War II is becoming increasingly fierce. The struggle between the major industrial countries of imperialism in competing for resources and markets is also extremely sharp. ③ Investment sources. The source of investment for Britain's planned development is built on the basis of capitalist pursuit of profits, which is not very reliable. Because it shifts with the level of profit rate. They expect the investment before 1962 to be 500 million pounds, which is not comparable to ours. Now, assuming that they can meet the requirements of the 1962 plan on schedule, and also assuming that they can continue to increase at the above rate after 1962, then if they want to reach 40 million tons, it will be after 1970 or 1971 at the earliest, which is already behind us. The assumption of Britain's increased production is not based on reliable evidence. Judging from the production situation in 1957, it is not as optimistic as they originally imagined.

    We Can Continuously Develop

    The superiority of the socialist system, the abundance of resources, and the growth of technical strength can enable our productive forces to continuously advance.

(3) What factors can guarantee our continuous development? ① First of all, the superiority of our socialist system guarantees that our productive forces will continue to advance unimpeded. China has a large population, and socialist industrial construction and large-scale farmland water conservancy construction will require a large amount of steel. The per capita figure is still not large, and it must continue to be greatly developed. In our country, there is a vast domestic market, and there is no problem of sales at all. Our agricultural products are also completely self-sufficient, and the leaping development of agriculture will require further improvement in industry. ② Our country has vast and abundant resources. The known coal reserves are more than one trillion tons, ranking third in the world. There will be new discoveries, which can be said to be inexhaustible. The reserves in Britain, however, are estimated to be only 183 billion tons. Between 1954 and 1956, Britain's coal mining volume hovered between 226 million and 228 million tons. In 1913, Britain reached a peak of 292 million tons, and then it declined. China's planned mining volume in 1958 has reached 67% of Britain's in 1956. If it increases at a rate of 17% in 1958, it can exceed the above level by the end of the second five-year plan. China has a vast territory, and 12 billion tons of iron ore reserves have been found after liberation, and they are generally evenly distributed in China's major economic regions. The Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, Yangtze River Basin, and North China have all discovered huge reserves, suitable for mining and smelting, without too much transportation equipment. Some parts of China have a large amount of phosphorus-containing iron ore, which is more suitable for converter steelmaking and can produce phosphate fertilizer equivalent to one-fifth of the steel output, for increasing agricultural production. The preliminary situation of a certain mining area is roughly equal to the total reserves of Britain. In addition, China's large amount of water resources is also an excellent prerequisite for China's metallurgical industry. We are also superior in alloys and refractory materials for steel. Except for a very small number of elements that still need to be worked hard to find, the rest can be self-sufficient. Some, such as tungsten ore, have always ranked first in the world in terms of output. China's pig iron output will be roughly equal to Britain's pig iron output by the end of the second five-year plan, and Britain will lag behind China in the early stage of the third five-year plan. ③ The growth of technical strength and the adoption of advanced technology. During the first five-year plan, under the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and Soviet experts and technical data support, China has cultivated and trained a team for production design and construction. Now it has learned the design and construction of huge integrated steel enterprises, which is a wealth accumulated in China's construction. The newly built large enterprises adopt advanced technology and new equipment. For example, large-capacity blast furnaces, large-capacity open-hearth furnaces, and powerful primary rolling mills are being trial-produced. These are all the latest technologies and equipment that mark modern production technology, and they all have the largest production capacity. We have learned and understood the socialist design ideology and the hardworking work style of building the country through diligence and thrift in political thought, and can better combine it with China's reality, so that this kind of thinking can be more widely implemented in future construction. In addition to building large factories in the second five-year plan, a series of small and medium-sized factories will also be built to accelerate the growth of China's steel in a shorter period of time. In the use of new technologies, we will summarize and improve the new creations and new experiences on China's production front. A certain proportion of converter steelmaking will be adopted to adapt to China's lack of scrap steel. In terms of international new technologies, oxygen converter steelmaking will be adopted. These methods can also produce a large amount of phosphate fertilizer to support agricultural production under appropriate resource conditions. Continuous casting will also be promoted after testing. Vacuum technology will also be used in the production of China's special steel. We will unremittingly learn advanced technologies from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, and also learn new scientific achievements from other countries that are beneficial to China's construction. The development of our equipment manufacturing is very large, and the self-sufficiency rate of equipment has now reached 90%, which makes it possible to shorten the time and reduce the cost.

(4) Development of equipment manufacturing. With the progress of construction, there has been great progress in equipment manufacturing. In the past, our self-sufficiency rate of equipment could only reach about 60%, and the rest had to rely on imports. Now, a higher percentage of equipment can be supplied domestically, including the huge metallurgical equipment, oxygen production equipment, and electro-smelting equipment mentioned earlier, which will all be manufactured by ourselves. This means some advance in time and reduction in construction costs.

    We spend less money and accomplish more. Investment capacity is increasing year by year, and there are achievements in savings. The conditions are very favorable.

(5) Sources of funds. China's production capacity is increasing day by day, and this year's construction investment has increased by 17.8%. In addition, a lot of funds will be saved from savings and anti-waste, and transferred to capital construction. China's investment in ferrous metallurgy in the first five years has been very large. Our backing is 600 million people. Our ability to invest in industrial construction in the future will greatly increase with the increase in total output value. Therefore, this aspect is much more superior than capitalist countries. According to calculations, China's investment in unit output is lower than that of Britain. This shows that we can spend less money and accomplish more than them, which is also a favorable condition for us.

    We have many people and our hearts are aligned

    We have countless people who are wholeheartedly engaged in labor for socialist construction, and their enthusiasm and creativity are incomparably high. Any capitalist country is far behind.

(6) The issue of labor. I think no country in the world dares to compete with us in labor. This is what we all understand. In addition, we are improving ideological education, which will save a large number of labor forces to serve the newly built factories. Combined with China's education policy, a large number of comrades who are both "red" and "expert" will successively go to production posts. They are wholeheartedly engaged in labor for the socialist cause, and are good at organizing and mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Capitalist countries are even more far behind in this point. When the industrial development of capitalist countries reaches a certain level, the problem of labor shortage occurs.

However, we still have many things that need to be further solved, and these problems are completely solvable. We must strengthen the research on the investigation and comprehensive utilization of related resources, and prepare for powerful continuous plate machines, continuous and semi-continuous rolling mills, universal rolling mills, pipe rolling mills and other rolling mills that cannot be produced now as soon as possible. The manufacturing of these equipments should be prepared in advance. We must also accelerate the solution of the manufacturing problems of large-capacity converters and related equipment. In terms of steel quality and variety, we must increase the variety and improve the quality to fully exert the use effect of steel. For the large amount of waste materials generated in the metallurgical industry, such as slag, waste heat, etc., combined with the specific situation, we will study and improve the utilization methods to better save materials and heat energy.

In short, according to the above preliminary analysis, we have excellent conditions to complete the call of the Party and Chairman Mao to catch up with or surpass Britain in a short period of time ahead of schedule. What remains is our subjective efforts, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit, riding the long wind of socialism and breaking thousands of miles of waves, and welcoming the high tide of China's socialist construction like the rising sun. We will definitely stand at the forefront of the battle line under the call of Chairman Mao, and resolutely and bravely stride towards socialism with the people of the whole country.

Please criticize and correct the above opinions.

    我国钢铁工业前途无限  英国钢铁生产未可乐观
    孙德和代表分析十五年内钢铁生产赶上英国的客观条件
    我完全拥护李副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告，薄副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告。我也完全拥护彭副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，与吴玉章主任所作文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告。
    报告中指出了我国人民在一九五七年在整风与反右派斗争的基础上取得了空前的伟大胜利，一九五七年在社会主义革命政治战线上与思想战线上的胜利带来了经济战线上的胜利，在国家经济工作上取得了伟大的成就。同时，经济战线上的胜利也巩固了政治战线上与思想战线上的胜利。这次政治运动通过大辩论粉碎了资产阶级右派分子复辟的阴谋活动，展开了两条道路的尖锐的阶级斗争，大力推动了知识分子的思想改造。在这次轰轰烈烈的实际的阶级斗争中，革命的火焰熔炉里，大部分的知识分子得到了思想与阶级觉悟的提高，这应该是社会主义革命中一个巨大的胜利。一九五八年的计划，确实反映了我国政治制度的优越，反映了我国人民在党的领导下力量的强大与无穷智慧。计划考虑了我国一切可能的积极因素，使我国的社会主义工业与农业齐步前进，走上第二个五年计划头一年工农业建设跃进的新高潮。我们将努力以无比愉快兴奋的心情来迎接这一年的工作任务，并努力超额完成计划。我们将坚决地进一步在发展建设工作里更好地从六亿人口出发，更好地发扬勤俭建国的精神，向浪费现象展开斗争，达到多、快、好、省。
    作为一个黑色冶金工业工作者，面对着社会主义建设旭日初升的前景，我们有难以形容的兴奋愉快，我们能有机会从事于毛主席所说的前人从来没有作过的极其光荣伟大的事业，特别是在党中央与我们亲爱的毛主席号召下，要在十五年或稍多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要产品的产量方面，赶上或者超过英国，我们衷心喜悦将担起这样光荣而巨大的任务，我们将得到严重考验与锻炼。我们有坚强的信心可以完成党交与我们这一代冶金工作者这样一个光荣繁重的任务，不会向困难低头，一定要顽强而出色地完成这一任务。现在我对一些客观条件作一个分析，以证明我们的信念。
    光辉的第一个五年
    我们获得了史无前例的钢铁增长速度，钢年增31％，铁年增41％。十二年左右，有可能达到四千万吨水平。
    （1）我国第一个五年计划钢产量自一九五二年的一百三十五万吨增加到一九五七年的五百二十四万吨，这是史无前例的增长速度，是只能够在社会主义国家由于社会主义制度优越才出现的奇迹。在资本主义国家是不可能出现的。第一个五年钢的增长是百分之三百八十九，即增到三点八九倍，每年递增百分之三十一。一九五八年计划的增长为百分之十九点二。第一个五年生铁的增长为百分之五百六十，每年递增百分之四十一，一九五八年的计划增长为百分之二十四点一。可以想像，整风运动及反右派斗争政治战线、思想战线上的胜利，将在黑色冶金工作人员中带来由于思想觉悟提高而形成的新的生产热情高潮，这个热情会主动地突破定额，超额完成计划。假定我们能经常保持百分之一百二十的增长系数，则大致在十年的时间便可能达到四千万吨的水平。从一九五八年起计算，则大致在一九六九至一九七○年即有可能达到四千万吨生产水平。完成这样巨大的任务自然不是简单计算可以说明的，必须进一步分析各方面的物质基础。
    英国前途并不乐观
    英国钢铁发展虽较早，但长期以来速度很慢，原定1962年达到二千八百五十万吨钢，但资本主义制度本身含有危机，还要受到国内外市场限制，原料短缺，投资不足的种种困难，难以达到想像中的成绩。
    （2）英国是钢铁业发展较早的国家，是个老牌的帝国主义国家，他的钢产量后来为苏、美所超过，战后一九五五年又为西德所超过，现在占世界的第四位。英国钢铁工业的发展，受到资本主义制度生产关系的限制，历次战争与经济危机的威胁以及市场等方面的影响，长期以来是很缓慢的。历年英国生铁的生产情况大致如下：第一次大战前最高在一九一三年达到一千零四十二万吨，其后即下降到八百至九百万吨的范围。第二次世界大战前从未超过此数。一九五二年才恢复到一千零九十万吨，一九五五年大致为一千二百六十七万吨，一九五六年达一千三百三十八万吨。历年英国钢产量的情况大致是：一九○○年五百万吨，一九一七年九百八十七万吨，战后下降。一九二九年又恢复到九百七十九万吨，一九三七年一千三百二十万吨（大战前夕），一九五○年一千六百六十万吨。从一九五一年以后才又有一些继续的增长，到一九五六年达到大致二千零九十九万吨。一九五七年英国当局计划钢的产量增加按百分之四点二四增长，自一九五四至一九六二年这八年期间增加百分之三十九点四，根据这一估计，一九六二年他们希望达到二千八百五十至二千九百万吨。英国要在一九六二年达到二千八百五十万吨钢锭产量，除去资本主义制度本身的危机及萧条等因素影响以外，还存在着下列几个严重的困难。①国内外市场的限制，国内外市场需要是否能按照他们的想像发展是个疑问。计划中还包括输出量约为五百万吨，现在帝国主义内部斗争很激烈，能否实现也是个问题。②资源不足，特别是本国铁矿远景储量不过三十八亿吨，含铁量不过百分之二十一至三十左右。由于废钢供应困难，一九六二年生铁产量须提高到一千九百九十万吨左右。现在每年进口富矿数量很大，按含铁量计算，一九五五年输入百分之五十三点五，一九五六年输入百分之六十，约为一千二百万吨，预计如需达到预期数字，须自遥远距离输入二千二百四十万吨富铁矿及锰矿。包括从南美洲，中美各岛及西非，挪威，瑞典，北非等地。根据欧洲其他国家的估计，增加输入一千万吨的富矿，将意味着须增加七十万吨海运货轮总吨位及必要的港口装卸设施与对矿源开发的投资。而且这些资源是掠夺弱小国家的，它与第二次大战后民族主义增长的尖锐矛盾是日益剧烈的。帝国主义几个主要工业国之间在争夺资源与市场的斗争，也是极端尖锐的。③投资来源。英国计划的发展投资来源建筑在资本主义追求利润的基础上的，是不很可靠的。因为它是随着利润率的高低而转移的。他们预计在一九六二年以前的投资为五亿英镑，是比不上我们的。现假定他们能按期达到一九六二年的计划要求，并且也假定一九六二年以后仍能按照以上的速度继续增加，则如果要达到四千万吨，最早将在一九七○至一九七一年以后，这已经是落在我们的后面。对英国增产的假定是没有可靠的根据的，从一九五七年的生产的情况来看，已经不像他们原来想像的乐观。
    我们能够不断发展
    社会主义制度的优越性、资源的丰富和技术力量的增长，能够使我们的生产力不断前进。
    （3）哪些因素可以保证我们能不断的发展？①首先是我们的社会主义制度的优越性保证我们的生产力不断的无阻碍的前进。我国人口众多，社会主义工业建设及广大的农田水利的建设都将大量的需要钢铁，每人平均的数字还不多，还须继续大大的发展。在我们的国度内，有广大的国内市场，根本不发生销路问题。我们的农产品又完全能自给自足，农业跃进的发展将要求工业进一步提高。②我国有广大丰富的资源，已知煤储量有一万亿吨以上，为世界上储量的第三位。还会有新发现，可以说是用之不竭。而英国之储量，估计不过一千八百三十亿吨。一九五四至一九五六年间，英国的煤开采量，始终徘徊于二亿二千六百至二亿二千八百万吨之间。一九一三年英国曾达到二亿九千二百万吨的高峰，其后即走下坡路，我国一九五八年的计划开采量已达到英国一九五六年的百分之六十七。如以一九五八年增长百分之十七的速度递增，则在第二个五年计划末期便可超出以上的水平。我国幅员广大，铁矿资源在解放后找到了一百二十亿吨的储藏，而且一般均匀分布在我国各重要经济区域。东北、西北、西南、长江流域、华北都发现巨大的储藏，适宜于开采，冶炼，不需过多的运输设备。我国某些部分有大量的含磷铁矿，更适宜于转炉炼钢，并可附产相当于钢产量五分之一的磷肥，供农业增产。某一个矿区初步情况就大致等于英国的总储量。另外我国大量的水利资源，也是我国冶金工业的优良的先决条件。钢铁用的合金及耐火材料，我们也是优越的。除极少数元素尚待努力寻找外，其余都可以自给，某些如钨矿一直在世界上占着第一位的产量。我国生铁的产量在第二个五年计划末将与英国生铁产量大致相平，第三个五年计划初期将使英国落在我国的后面。③技术力量的增长与先进技术的采用。第一个五年计划期间在苏联与苏联专家兄弟般的援助及技术资料支援之下，我国已经培养锻炼了一支生产设计与施工的队伍。现在已经学会了包括巨大的联合钢铁企业的设计与施工，这是我国建设中积累下来的一笔财富。在新建的大的企业里，所采用的是先进的技术与新型的装备。例如正在试制大容量的高炉，大容量的平炉，与能力强大的初轧机。这些都是标志着现代生产技术中最新的技术与装备，它们都有最巨大的生产能力。我们在政治思想上学习体会了社会主义设计思想与勤俭建国的苦干的工作作风，能更好地结合我国的实际，使这样的思想更广泛地贯彻到今后的建设中去。第二个五年计划内除去建立大厂外，还要建立一系列的中小厂，在较短时期内加速我国钢铁的增长。在使用新技术上，将总结提高我国生产战线上新的创造，新的经验。将采用一定比例的转炉炼钢，以适应我国废钢缺乏的情况。在国际新技术方面将采用氧气转炉炼钢。这些方法在资源适当的情况下，还可以附产大量磷肥支援农业增产。连续铸锭也将在试验后进行推广。真空技术也将在我国特殊钢的生产中得到应用。我们将不懈地向苏联及人民民主国家学习他们的先进技术，也将学习有利于我国建设的其他国家新的科学成就。我们设备制造发展很大设备自给率现在已达90％，这就有可能争取缩短时间，降低成本。
    （4）设备制造方面的发展。随着建设的进展，设备制造方面有了巨大的进展。我们设备的自给率以往大致只能达到百分之六十，其余须依靠输入。现在则有更高百分比的设备可以由国内供应，包括前面所说的庞大的冶金设备，制氧设备，电冶炼设备等等，都将由自己制造。这意味着某些时间上的提前与建设费用的降低。
    我们少花钱多办事投资能力逐年在增大，节约又有成绩，条件非常有利。
    （5）资金来源。我国的生产能力日益高涨，今年建设投资额增加百分之十七点八。另外在节约及反浪费上还会节省下来很大的资金，转入基本建设。我国第一个五年在黑色冶金方面的投资已经很大。我们的后台是六亿人民。我们今后投资于工业建设的能力，将随着总产值的增加大大地增多。所以这方面更是比资本主义国家优越得多。根据计算，我国用于单位产量的投资要比英国低。这就说明我们可以少花钱比他们多办事，这也是我们有利的条件。
    我们人又多心又齐
    我们有无数的忠心耿耿为社会主义建设而忘我地进行劳动的人，积极性和创造性无比高涨，任何资本主义国家都望尘莫及。
    （6）劳动力的问题。我想世界上任何一个国家也不敢同我们比赛劳动力。这是我们都了解的。另外我们正在提高思想教育，将节约大批的劳动力为新建的厂服务。结合我国的教育方针，将有大批的又“红”又“专”的同志陆续到生产岗位上去，他们是忠心耿耿地为着社会主义事业忘我地进行劳动，而且善于组织、发动群众的积极性创造性。这一点资本主义国家就更是望尘莫及的了。资本主义国家工业发展到一定程度，就发生劳动力的不足的问题。
    但是我们也还有许多的事需进一步努力解决的，这些问题都是完全有条件可以解决的。我们必须加强对有关资源调查与综合利用的研究，要及早准备能力强大的连续板机、连续及半连续轧机、万能轧机、轧管机及其他现在还不能生产的轧机，这些设备制造应提前作好准备工作。还须加速解决大容量转炉及有关设备的制造问题。在钢材质量与品种方面，须增加品种提高质量，充分发挥钢材的使用效果。对于冶金工业中产生的大量废弃物资，如炉渣、废热等，结合具体情况，研究提高利用的方法，更好地节约物资及热能。
    总之，根据以上初步分析，我们有优良的条件在短期内提前完成党与毛主席提出的赶上或超过英国这一号召。剩下来的是我们主观的努力，发扬革命干劲，乘社会主义的长风破万里浪，迎接像旭日初升的我国社会主义建设高潮。我们一定在毛主席的号召下，站在战线的最前列，随着全国人民坚决勇敢地大踏步向社会主义迈进。
    以上意见是否妥当请诸位代表批评指正。
