    These agricultural machines include electric light-duty tractors, hydraulic power machines, artificial rainmakers, paddy field tillage machines, small excavators, various crop seeding, fertilizing, cultivating, harvesting, threshing, and drying machines, various agricultural product and feed processing machines, as well as complete sets of equipment for fertilizer plants and sugar factories, and improved animal-powered vehicles.
