Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and its associations and research societies held meetings from February 13th to 16th to discuss further developing literary and artistic creation to adapt to the situation of the national production Great Leap Forward.

Participants believed that our country is currently in a period of rapid advancement in various socialist construction endeavors. How to reflect the rapidly changing face of socialist construction and the heroic spirit of the working people in literary and artistic creation, and further encourage people's creative labor enthusiasm through creation, and achieve a great leap forward in literary and artistic creation is a common concern of literary and artistic workers across the country.

These meetings reviewed the situation on the literary and art front in 1957. Everyone believed that after the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, socialist enthusiasm generally surged in literary and art circles, and many writers and artists went deep among the workers and peasants to prepare for creation or artistic practice. Many people are also considering three-year and five-year plans, with the ambition to produce good works. In terms of literary creation, many literary works were published in 1957, with 39 novels ranging from 300,000 to 400,000 characters. Many good literary works, films, and dramas have been warmly welcomed by readers and audiences. In terms of fine arts, oil paintings, prints, and comic strips have all made progress. In terms of theatrical performance practice, the better programs performed by many local theater troupes have greatly enriched people's cultural life. All of these indicate that the literary and art front in 1957 not only reaped great ideological gains but also made gains in creation. This has laid a good foundation for the great leap forward in literary and artistic creation in the future.

Writer Lao She said: The Party Central Committee pointed out that the assessment of the effectiveness of various construction undertakings should be based on five years looking at three, and three years looking at the first year. Our literary creation should also be like this. 1958 is the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan and the year before the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. The literary and art circles must have enthusiasm and drive to produce some better works to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country and promote the further prosperity of literary and artistic creation in the future. In his speech, Lao She also particularly emphasized that literary creators in the same industry should maintain close contact and, according to the urgent needs of the people and the lives they are familiar with, formulate their respective creation plans in a division of labor and cooperation, so as to more effectively exert the existing forces and fully reflect the new changes in all aspects of the socialist revolution from various perspectives. Playwrights Tian Han, Yang Hansheng, Ouyang Yuqian, Cao Yu, and film director Cai Chusheng all talked about the creative potential of drama and film scripts that could be further explored. They said that new events and new people are emerging endlessly in real life. In this great era, literary creators should not only have longer-term plans to nurture larger works but also write more short and concise works to reflect the face of the times in a timely manner. Ouyang Yuqian said: Playwrights should write more, with diverse themes and styles, and strive for more, faster, better, and more economical in artistic creation. Raising requirements should be based on popularization, and we should "seek quality in quantity." Novelist Zhao Shuli criticized the literary and art circles at the meeting for not serving workers, peasants, and soldiers enough. He said that the writing style should be changed so that new literary and artistic works can truly be close to the common people. Musicians Lü Ji and He Luting both proposed that mass singing movements should be vigorously developed. Painters Wu Zuoren, dancers Dai Ailian, and others talked about their creative aspirations at the meeting.

Zhou Yang, vice chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said that in order for literary and artistic creation to achieve a great leap forward, it must be combined with the workers and peasants on a larger scale and deeper level, and the works must be able to break through past levels not only in quantity but also in quality. To this end, literary and artistic workers must adhere to going to the countryside, going to the mountains, going to the factories, and going to the troops, living with the working people for a long time. This should become the fundamental principle of our literary and artistic work. He hoped that literary and artistic workers going to the countryside should not only actively participate in physical labor to exercise themselves but also do their best to help local people improve their culture and conduct amateur art activities. Zhou Yang believes that one of the important keys to promoting creation is to carry out literary and artistic criticism work. He advocated that various literary and artistic publications and associations should adopt methods such as publishing articles, holding symposiums, and organizing special discussions to carry out criticism and free discussion. We must ensure that newspapers have book reviews every week, periodicals have book reviews every issue, every film (new film) every performance (performance of new music and drama works), every exhibition (exhibition) must be reviewed. Criticism mainly encourages the good and also criticizes the bad. There should be debates with different opinions. We advocate short, concise, and timely short reviews. Publications should earnestly implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." It is hoped that more pioneers with creative spirit and innovative courage will emerge in the literary and art circles. They dare to break the rules and create new situations. Only in this way can we vigorously promote the great leap forward in literary and artistic creation.

At the enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles on the 13th, the issue of whether to convene the Third National Congress of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1958 was also discussed. The members of the Presidium and National Committee attending the meeting all believed that many writers have now gone deep into the countryside and factories, and everyone has high creative enthusiasm. They unanimously advocated postponing the Third National Congress. The meeting also decided to remove the rightists Ding Ling, Jiang Feng, and Chen Yi from their positions as members of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and to suspend the rightists Ding Ling, Jiang Feng, Ai Qing, Chen Yi, Bai Lang, Lu Kanru, and Lian Kuoru from their positions as members of the National Committee of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. In view of work needs, the meeting elected Xu Guangping and Wu Zuoren as members of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

    在更大规模和更深程度上同工农相结合
    让文艺创作来一个大丰收
    中国文联及各协会、各研究会讨论发展文艺创作适应全国生产大跃进
    据新华社18日讯　中国文联及各协会、各研究会，13日到16日分别召开会议，讨论进一步发展文艺创作以适应全国生产大跃进的形势。
    大家认为：目前我们国家正处在各项社会主义建设事业飞跃前进的时候，如何把社会主义建设突飞猛进的面貌和劳动人民的英雄气概在文艺创作中反映出来，并通过创作进一步鼓舞人们创造性的劳动热情，在文艺创作方面也来一个大跃进，是全国文艺工作者普遍关心的问题。
    这些会上对1957年文艺战线上的情况作了回顾。大家认为，1957年文艺界经过反右派斗争后，社会主义热情普遍高涨，许多作家、艺术家纷纷深入工农群众，进行创作准备或艺术实践。不少的人还在考虑三年、五年的计划，有雄心要生产好作品。在文艺创作方面，1957年出版了很多的文学作品，三十万字到四十万字的长篇小说就有三十九部。不少好的文学作品、电影和戏剧受到了读者、观众的热烈欢迎。美术方面，油画版画连环画都有进展。在戏剧演出实践方面，许多地方剧团演出的较好节目，大大丰富了人民的文化生活。所有这些，都说明1957年文艺战线上不仅在思想上有很大收获，在创作上也有收获。这就为今后文艺创作上的大跃进，打下了良好的基础。
    作家老舍说：党中央指出，对各种建设事业成效的估计，应该是五年看三年，三年看头年，我们文艺创作也应该这样。1958年是第二个五年计划的第一年，又是建国十周年的前一年，文艺界一定要有一股热情和干劲，拿出一些较好的东西来，迎接建国十周年，并以此推动今后文艺创作进一步的繁荣。老舍在发言中还特别强调同行同业的文艺创作者之间，应该密切联系，按照人民的迫切需要和各人所熟悉的生活，分工合作地拟订各自的创作计划，以便更有效地发挥现有的力量，把社会主义革命中各方面发生的新变化，从各个角度充分地反映出来。戏剧家田汉、阳翰笙、欧阳予倩、曹禺和电影导演蔡楚生都在会上谈到戏剧和电影剧本的创作潜力还可以更多地发掘。他们说，现实生活中新事、新人层出不穷。在这个大时代里，文艺创作者一方面应该有较长期的计划，孕育较大的作品，一方面也应该多写一些短小精悍的作品，及时地把时代的面貌反映出来。欧阳予倩说：剧作家应当多写，题材、风格要多样，在艺术创作上也要力求多、快、好、省。要求提高，要有普及做基础，应当“量中求质”。小说家赵树理在会上批评文艺界为工农兵服务太不够了，应当切实改变文风，使新文艺作品真正能够接近老百姓。音乐家吕骥、贺绿汀都提出了应当大力开展群众歌咏运动。画家吴作人、舞蹈家戴爱莲等都在会上谈了自己的创作愿望。
    中国文联副主席周扬说，要文艺创作来一个大跃进，就必须使它在更大规模和更深程度上和工农群众相结合，作品不但在量上而且在质上都能突破过去的水平。为此，文艺工作者必须坚持下乡、上山、下厂、下部队，长期和劳动人民生活在一起，这应成为我们文艺工作的根本方针。他希望下乡的文艺工作者除积极参加体力劳动以锻炼自己外，还应尽力帮助当地群众提高文化和进行业余艺术活动。周扬认为推动创作的重要关键之一是开展文艺评论工作。他主张各种文艺刊物和各个协会，今后要采取发表文章、召开座谈会和组织专题讨论等方式，开展批评和自由讨论。做到报纸每周有书评、刊物每期有书评、每片（新影片）每演（音乐、戏剧新作品演出）、每展（展览会）必评。批评主要是鼓励好的，同时也要批评坏的。要有不同意见的争论。提倡短小、精悍、及时的短评。刊物应当切实贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。希望文学艺术界多出现一些有创造精神、有革新勇气的闯将。他们敢于打破常规，开创新局面。只有这样，才能蓬蓬勃勃地推动文艺创作向前跃进。
    13日中国文联主席团扩大会议上还讨论了1958年是否召开中国文联第三次代表大会的议题。出席会议的主席团委员和全国委员都认为，目前许多作家已经深入农村、工厂，大家的创作热情很高。他们一致主张第三次代表大会延期举行。会上还决定撤销右派分子丁玲、江丰、陈沂等三人中国文联主席团委员的职务，停止右派分子丁玲、江丰、艾青、陈沂、白朗、陆侃如、连阔如等七人中国文联全国委员的职务。鉴于工作需要，会议补选了许广平、吴作人二人为中国文联主席团委员。
