I fully agree with the reports presented by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the State Council. These reports will play a significant role in further developing our country's socialist economy and cultural construction. The people of Shaanxi, like those in other parts of the country, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, have victoriously completed the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets. They will resolutely fight to achieve the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets!

Now, I will discuss some new phenomena that have emerged in the industrial and agricultural production fronts in the Shaanxi region after the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle.

A New Look on the Industrial and Agricultural Production Fronts

The nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle represent a great victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and they are the most fundamental driving force for promoting all tasks. On the basis of the general improvement of the people's political consciousness, all tasks have shown a thriving new atmosphere, and industrial and agricultural production has also entered a new upsurge, with many unprecedented outstanding achievements. In industrial production, according to statistics from 168 key industrial enterprises in our province, the planned output value for July before the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle was 55 million yuan, only 97.53 percent of the plan was completed. With the deepening of the rectification movement, the planned output value rose to more than 84 million yuan in December, completing 119 percent of the plan. The number of units that completed the plan also increased from 102 in July to 130 in December. Recently, many moving and vivid examples have continued to emerge: for example, on January 9, Tan Bochang, a worker in the 13th workshop of the Qinling Electric Factory, improved production tools and increased work efficiency threefold; on the same day, Qian Lichang, a worker in the 31st workshop, completed the work quota of 5 hours and 50 minutes in 5 minutes, increasing work efficiency by 69 times; the Baoji Overhaul Factory had failed to complete its monthly plan since 1955, but in November last year, it completed the plan for the first time with a 21 percent overfulfillment, and in December, it increased by 64.5 percent compared with November; Xian No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill has fully completed its production plan every month since the fourth quarter of 1957, and the quality of yarn and cloth has significantly improved. The first-class and above cotton yarn only reached 66.19 percent in October, but rose to 99.38 percent in November, and the amount of cotton used per yarn was also reduced to 191.79 kilograms, creating the latest record since the factory was established; the staff of the Xi'an Power Grid Management Office created 150 advanced experiences in 20 days in November last year, including the replacement of reinforced concrete power poles, which saved the state 40,000 yuan.

Remarkable Achievements in Water Conservancy Construction: Three Short Months Surpass Two Thousand Years

The situation in agricultural production and construction is exactly the same. The speed of grain purchase, drought-resistant wheat planting, and water conservancy construction are all unprecedented. In 1956, agriculture in our province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in history, but the grain purchase task was not completed until the summer of 1957. In 1957, the harvest was a normal year with a slight deficiency, and the purchase task was overfulfilled in December of the same year. Last autumn, it did not rain for nearly 100 days, and the drought was very serious. The masses not only did not "look to the clouds for rain" as in the past, but actively responded to the call of the Party and the government. Men, women, old and young all worked together, doing everything possible to overcome difficulties, and persisted in carrying water for planting and tilling soil for replanting day and night. As a result, more than 24 million mu of wheat in the province were planted in a timely manner and were not greatly affected by the drought. The situation in water conservancy construction is an even more stark contrast. The task of expanding irrigation by 3 million mu in 1956 was not completed, so the task was reduced to 2 million mu in 1957. By the end of September, only 1.02 million mu had been completed, and some people said that "development has reached its peak and there is no more potential to tap." However, from October to December, there was a great leap forward in water conservancy construction. In just three months, 3.89 million mu of irrigated land were built, which is 300,000 mu more than the irrigated land built in the past two thousand years. The task of expanding irrigation in 1958 was also overfulfilled.

Building "Hanging Weirs," Rice Fields on the Qinling Mountains, Water on Wuzhangyuan, Surpassing Zhuge Liang

In the process of water conservancy construction, the people showed unprecedentedly high enthusiasm, exerted infinite wisdom and strength, and carried out arduous and persistent struggles. They tunneled through mountains, crossed ridges, crossed ditches, and built bridges, trying every means to turn dry land into paddy fields. For example, Youfeng Township in Wugong County tunneled through the mountains to build three underground canals with a total length of 40 li, diverting water to the plains and irrigating more than 3,000 mu of land; the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Qishan County created a five-stage water lifting method to lift water to the Qi Yongyuan, which is more than 20 zhang high, turning 300 mu of dry land into paddy fields; the masses in Caojia Township cut mountains and split rocks to build canals, diverting river water to the "Wuzhangyuan," which is 40 zhang high, irrigating more than 5,000 mu of land; the masses in Lueyang and Ningqiang and other places, without avoiding dangers and fearing difficulties, built "Hanging Weirs," "Tunneling Weirs," and "Ring Mountain Weirs," making rice fields reach the Qinling Mountains and the Bashan Mountains. The masses reflected: "Zhuge Liang once wanted to divert water to the plains (Wuzhangyuan) to solve the problem of drinking water for the soldiers, but he failed to do so. Today, the Communist Party leads us, and we have actually built water on 'Wuzhangyuan' and rice fields flying up the mountain." While carrying out water conservancy construction, they also implemented the spirit of "building and utilizing at the same time" with unparalleled enthusiasm, and carried out winter irrigation in a timely manner. Xichenzhuang Cooperative in Bailu Township, Pucheng County, put forward the slogan "Go to the fields early and see the stars, come back in the evening when the chickens crow" during the winter irrigation period. Out of the 1,116 waterwheels in the township, 310 were powered by manpower due to lack of animal power; members of the Jiaqu Cooperative in Jiaqu Township, in order to compete for the red flag for winter irrigation, put forward the heroic slogan "Seize sunny days, grab cloudy days, light wind and light snow are good days, light bulbs are daytime, strive for one day to be two days"; Huifeng Cooperative in Yongfeng Township also put forward the guarantee that "the director does not leave the canal, the captain does not leave the land, the land does not leave the people, and the people do not leave the tools," which played a great role in the winter irrigation work. This revolutionary spirit of the people is playing an infinite and great role like the splitting of atomic nuclei. As Vice Premier Bo said, it "will make everyone full of confidence and hope for our great future." Why did two completely different situations appear before and after the rectification movement? The main reason is that after the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, people's political awareness has been further improved, and their ideological understanding has become clearer, so they can generate strong determination and strength. This also illustrates a point, that is, the truth that "things are done by people" and "people can conquer nature." As long as people's socialist consciousness is improved and the work style of cadres is changed, they can generate revolutionary enthusiasm, fully exert their subjective initiative, overcome any difficulties, and make achievements that move mountains and overturn seas. For example, the Xi'an Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Zhongxing Electric Machinery Factory and the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory are a stark contrast. The comrades of the Zhongxing Electric Machinery Factory are diligent, frugal, and modest. Although the equipment is old, the products are very good. The Agricultural Machinery Factory, on the other hand, is complacent and arrogant. The machines are brand new, but the scrap rate is alarming. Longwangmiao Township in Shang County is a poor mountain area, but with the heroic spirit of "mountains are not higher than hoes, and stones are not harder than hammers," they have built more than 1,000 mu of irrigated land in more than a year. The output of terraced fields is dozens of times higher than in the past, and with the income from sideline production, the average annual income per person exceeds the average annual income per person in the entire special zone by nearly one time. The Guibao Ditch in Guidebao Township, Yulin County, is a hilly and gully area with a lot of wind and sand. After artificial hard work, it has been transformed into a "Thousand Jin Ditch," with an average yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu of grain in 423 mu, of which 4.5 mu of high-yield fields reached an average yield of 1,900 jin per mu. The geological conditions of Zaoping Cooperative in Chunhua County are not very superior, but they can research and cultivate, and cultivate carefully, and the corn yield per mu reaches 2,294 jin. The Houqinghe Agricultural Cooperative in Yijun County, which has never had the habit of planting rice, has two mu of paddy fields, which, after diligent cultivation, have a rice yield of 1,654 jin per mu. On the contrary, Qingge County has reduced production year by year since 1953, especially in many places in Zhouzhi County, the geological conditions are quite superior, but production has declined year by year since 1953. This shows how obvious the two situations, two practices, and the two consequences are!

This Year, We Decide to Strive for a Great Leap Forward

Local Industrial Output Value Increases by One-Third

Guarantee to Expand Irrigated Area by 10 Million Mu

Total Grain Output Reaches 11.5 Billion Jin

1958 is the first year of our country's Second Five-Year Plan. We must do everything possible to think of all methods, exert all our strength, and promote a great leap forward in national economic development. This year, we will strive to increase the total output value of local industry by more than one-third compared with 1957, and we will make full use of mountainous industrial resources to vigorously develop mountainous industrial construction. Soil and water conservation occupies a very important position in our province. It is not only related to the development of production in the mountainous areas of our province, but also related to the problems that have not been solved in the treatment of the Yellow River for thousands of years in history. Some people believe that it will take 30 to 50 years to control 50% of the area of soil erosion. I think it is conservative and does not sufficiently estimate the great power of the people. We plan to strive to basically control soil erosion in the province within five years or a little more, especially to control soil erosion in the tributary areas upstream of the Sanmenxia Reservoir ahead of schedule. In terms of water conservancy work, this year we will vigorously develop small-scale water storage projects in mountainous and plateau areas, and guarantee to expand the irrigated area by 10 million mu. In terms of increasing grain and cotton production, we will strive to cross the Yangtze River and reach 800 jin per mu of grain in the 800-li Qinchuan Plain in eight to ten years. This year, the total grain output will reach 11.5 billion jin; the total output of ginned cotton will reach 2.4 million dan. Afforestation will reach 5 million mu. In mountainous areas, we will vigorously carry out the campaign of planting one sheng of walnuts per household to solve the problem of insufficient oil crops. We will raise "money trees" on barren mountains and turn barren mountains into orchards to increase the income of the masses. Make the lives of farmers in mountainous areas better. There are two old Chinese sayings: "The plan for the year lies in spring, and the plan for the day lies in morning." This is the summary of experience over many years. We must look at three years in five years, and look at the first year in three years. This year, on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, we must muster our energy, strive for the upstream, further rely on the masses, implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, resolutely oppose extravagance and waste, continue to overcome right-leaning conservative ideas, eliminate officialdom, and heroically and tenaciously fight against nature, and develop production and construction more, faster, better, and more economically. Actively respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. In the struggle to achieve the forty articles of the agricultural development program ahead of schedule and exceeding targets, and to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little more, we will definitely be able to achieve victory.

　　要八百里秦川亩产八百斤
    赵寿山代表的发言
    我完全同意人大常委会和国务院提出的几个报告。这些报告对进一步发展我国社会主义经济和文化建设事业将起着重要的作用。陕西人民，同全国其他地区一样，在党中央和国务院的正确领导下，已经胜利地提前超额完成了第一个五年计划。并将坚决地为争取提前和超额完成第二个五年计划而斗争！
    现在，我谈一谈陕西地区经过整风运动和反右派斗争，在工农业生产战线上出现的一些新气象。
    工农业生产战线一片新气象
    全民性的整风运动和反右派斗争，是政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命一个伟大的胜利，是推动各项工作的最基本的力量。在人民群众政治觉悟普遍提高的基础上，各项工作已经呈现出欣欣向荣的新气象，工农业生产也随之进入了一个新的高涨，出现了许多前所未有的优异成绩。在工业生产上，据我省一百六十八个重点工业企业的统计，在整风和反右派斗争以前的七月份的计划产值是五千五百万元，只完成了计划的百分之九十七点五三，随着整风运动的深入，到十二月份计划产值上升为八千四百多万元，完成了计划的百分之一百一十九。完成的单位，也由七月份的一百零二个，增加到十二月份的一百三十个。最近以来，又连续不断的出现了许多动人的生动事例：如一月九日秦岭电工厂十三车间工人谭伯昌，改进了生产工具，提高工时效率三倍；同一天，三十一车间工人钱立昶在五分钟内完成了五小时零五十分钟的工时定额，提高工效六十九倍；宝鸡大修厂自一九五五年以来，月月完不成计划，去年十一月份首次超额百分之二十一完成计划，十二月份又比十一月份提高了百分之六十四点五；咸阳国棉二厂，自一九五七年第四季度起，月月全面完成生产计划，纱布质量显著提高，十月份棉纱一等一级以上仅达百分之六十六点一九，而十一月份则上升为百分之九十九点三八，件纱用棉量也降低至一百九十一点七九公斤，创造了开厂以来的最新纪录；西安电网管理所的职工，在去年十一月份的二十天内，创造先进经验一百五十件，其中改换钢筋混凝电杆一件即给国家节约四万元。
    水利建设获得惊人成就  短短三个月胜过两千年
    农业生产建设方面的情况也完全一样。粮食征购、抗旱种麦和兴修水利等工作进行的速度都是空前的。一九五六年，我省的农业是历史上空前的大丰收，但是却一直到一九五七年夏季才完成了粮食征购任务。而一九五七年是个平年偏歉的收成，在同年的十二月份即超额完成了征购任务。去年秋季将近一百天没有下雨，旱象十分严重，群众不但不像以往那样的“大旱望云霓”，而是积极地响应党和政府的号召，男女老幼一齐动手，千方百计地克服困难，不分黑明昼夜地坚持进行担水点种和捣土补苗工作，结果全省两千四百多万亩小麦，得到了适时下种，没有受旱灾的大亏。兴修水利的情况更是一个鲜明的对比，一九五六年三百万亩扩大灌溉任务没有完成，因之在一九五七年把任务减少为二百万亩，到九月底仅仅完成了一百零二万亩，还有人说“已经发展到顶，再无潜力可挖”。可是从十月到十二月份，来了一个水利建设的大跃进，短短的三个月，就修成了水地三百八十九万亩，比历史上两千年所修的水地还多三十万亩，并且超额完成了一九五八年的扩大灌溉任务。
    修成悬天堰　稻田上秦岭  水上五丈原　赛过诸葛亮
    在兴修水利的过程中，人民群众表现了从所未有的高涨情绪，发挥了无穷的智慧和力量，进行了艰苦持久的斗争。他们凿山穿岭、渡沟架桥，想尽各种办法变旱地为水田。例如：武功县游凤乡，穿透山原修成了三条合长四十华里的地下渠道，引水上原，灌田三千多亩；岐山县红星农业社，创造了五级提水的办法，把水提上二十多丈高的碛雍原，使三百亩旱地变为水田，曹家乡的群众，削山劈石，开修渠道，把河水引上四十丈高的“五丈原”，浇地五千多亩；略阳、宁强等地群众不避艰险，不畏困难，修成了“悬天堰”、“穿山堰”、“环山堰”，使稻田上了秦岭，上了巴山，群众反映说：“诸葛亮当年曾想引水上原（五丈原），解决军士吃水问题，但没有做到，今天共产党领导我们，居然办到了水上‘五丈原’、稻田飞上山”。在兴修水利的同时，他们还以无比的热情，贯彻了“边兴修边利用”的精神，及时地进行了冬灌。蒲城县白卤乡西陈庄社，在冬灌期间，提出了“清早上地满天星，晚间回来鸡叫声”的口号，全乡一千一百一十六部水车，因畜力缺乏，人力推动的就有三百一十部；贾曲乡贾曲社的社员，为了争夺冬灌红旗，提出“抓晴天，抢阴天，小风小雪是好天，汽灯底下是白天，争取一天当两天”的英雄口号；永丰乡的会丰社也提出“主任不离渠，队长不离地，地不离人，人不离工具”的保证，对冬灌工作起了很大的作用。人民群众的这种革命干劲，像分裂了的原子核一样正在发挥无穷无尽的伟大作用。诚如薄副总理所说的“将会使每个人对于我们伟大的未来充满信心、充满希望”。为什么会在整风运动前后出现截然不同的两种情况呢？主要是经过整风运动和反右派斗争，人们的政治觉悟进一步提高了，思想认识更加明确了，因而能够产生坚强的决心和力量。这也说明了一个问题，就是“事在人为”“人定胜天”的道理，只要人们的社会主义觉悟提高了，干部的作风改变了，就能够产生革命的干劲，就能够充分发挥主观能动性，克服任何困难，做出移山倒海的成绩。比如，西安市公私合营中兴电机制造厂和西安农业机械厂就是一个鲜明的对比。中兴电机制造厂工作同志勤俭谦逊，设备虽旧产品很好，农业机械厂则老大自满，机器全新而报废惊人。商县龙王庙乡是一个穷苦的山区，而他们以“山高没有锄头高，石硬没有铁锤硬”的英雄气概，在一年多的时间里，修成了一千多亩水地，梯田产量高出以往数十倍，加上副业收入，每人全年平均收入超过了全专区每人全年平均收入将近一倍。榆林县归德堡乡的归德堡沟是个多风沙的丘陵甘壑地带，经过人为的辛勤劳动，一变而为千斤沟，四百二十三亩粮食亩产平均达到一千斤以上，其中有四亩半高额丰产田平均亩产竟达一千九百斤。淳化县枣坪社的地质条件并不十分优越，而能研究培育，精耕细作，玉米亩产达到二千二百九十四斤。从来没有种稻习惯的宜君县后清河农业社有二亩水地，经过辛勤培育，稻谷亩产达一千六百五十四斤，相反的清阁县，1953年以来年年减产，尤其是盩厔县的好多地方，地质条件相当优越，但从一九五三年以来，生产逐年下降。这就可以看出两种情况、两种做法和产生的两种后果，是多么明显啊！
    今年决定争取大跃进
    地方工业产值增加三分之一
    保证扩大灌溉面积一千万亩
    粮食总产量达一百十五亿斤
    一九五八年是我国第二个五年计划的第一年，我们要千方百计地想尽一切办法，发挥一切力量，促进国民经济发展的大跃进。今年要争取地方工业的总产值比一九五七年增加三分之一以上，并将充分利用山区工业资源，大力发展山区工业建设。水土保持在我省占着十分重要的地位，它不仅关系着我省山区生产的发展，也关系着历史上几千年来治理黄河所没有解决的问题。有人认为须要三十至五十年，才能控制水土流失面积百分之五十。我认为保守了，没有足够的估计到人民的伟大力量。我们打算争取在五年或者稍多一点的时间内基本控制全省范围的水土流失，尤其是要提前控制三门峡上游支流地区的水土流失。在水利工作方面，今年要狠狠地发展山原地区小型蓄水工程，保证扩大灌溉面积一千万亩。在粮棉增产上要争取八年到十年使八百里秦川的粮食亩产跨过长江，达到八百斤。今年粮食总产量要达到一百一十五亿斤；皮棉总产量达到二百四十万担。造林达到五百万亩，在山区，大力开展每家种一升核桃的运动，解决油料不足问题，在秃山养起摇钱树，把荒山变成花果园来增加群众的收入。使山区农民生活过得更好一些。中国有两句古话说：“一年之计在于春，一日之计在于晨”这是多少年来的经验总结，我们要五年看三年，三年看头年。今年要在整风运动和反右派斗争胜利的基础上，鼓足劲头，力争上游，进一步依靠群众，贯彻勤俭建国的方针，坚决反对铺张浪费，继续克服右倾保守思想，打掉官气，英勇顽强地向自然作斗争，更多、更快、更好、更省的发展生产建设。积极地响应党中央和国务院的伟大号召，在提前超额实现农业发展纲要四十条和在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的斗争中，我们一定能够取得胜利。
