Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The draft of the 1958 National Budget and the draft of the National Economic Annual Plan, submitted by the State Council to the Fifth Session of the National People's Congress, point to an inspiring and glorious prospect for the people. This new year will be a year of unprecedented leap forward in construction. Whether the targets set in the budget and the plan can be fulfilled and overfulfilled, the representatives unanimously gave a firm and positive answer during the group discussions.

　　On the morning of the 3rd and 4th, the representatives discussed the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Bo Yibo. They agreed with these reports, believing that after the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, the socialist consciousness of the people throughout the country has been greatly enhanced, and the momentum of the revolutionary leap forward is as magnificent as mountains and rivers. The state budget and the annual economic plan have already taken into account the endless power of the masses and the great initiative and creativity of the masses. The representatives expressed their determination to lead the broad masses to undertake a vigorous cause in this new year.

    Our Country Has Great Potential
    Many representatives pointed out that our great country still has great potential to be tapped. Representatives from Shandong, Hubei, Sichuan, Liaoning, Guangxi, Tianjin, and other provinces and cities pointed out that as long as the masses are boldly mobilized to tap the potential in all aspects, there is sufficient confidence to overcome various difficulties and overfulfill this year's plan. Some representatives from Shandong Province mentioned that the province suffered severe natural disasters last year, and the population is large while the land is scarce. This year's grain supply is relatively tight, but the farmers in the province have an unprecedentedly high revolutionary enthusiasm and tenacious fighting spirit. They do not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. Some have proposed that the yield per mu of crops should exceed 500 jin in one year and cross the Yangtze River in three years. The original plan for grain output in the province in 1958 was to reach 32 billion jin, an increase of 6 billion jin compared to last year. After discussion by the masses, it is not only confident to complete 32 billion jin this year, but also strive to reach 35 billion jin, an increase of 34% compared to last year. Cai Yitian, a representative from Hubei Province and a model agricultural worker, cited many vivid examples in the discussion to illustrate that as long as the leadership seriously relies on the masses, it will definitely be able to overcome various difficulties and overfulfill this year's production and construction plan. He said that there is a large river near Gucheng County, where he lives. Because there were many difficult conditions in developing water conservancy, no one had ever used this river for thousands of years. In the upsurge of large-scale water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, the farmers in this county have already built four large river channels, one of which has to pass through a cliff, excavate a very long cave, and build a very wide and high dam. Cai Yitian said that such a huge project was something he dared not even dream of in the past.

    This Year's Plan Can Definitely Be Overfulfilled
    National industrial labor models Wang Chonglun and Zhang Zifu affirmed that this year's national budget and national economic plan can definitely be overfulfilled. Wang Chonglun said that the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel have great revolutionary enthusiasm. The workers in the tool workshop where he works proposed many suggestions for improving production when discussing this year's production plan. The preliminary plan is to complete this year's production plan one and a half months ahead of schedule. Zhang Zifu said that the workers of Fushun Coal Mine have full confidence in completing the national plan. Now the miners are actively thinking of ways to tap production potential. In the first half of January this year, the entire mine has already overproduced more than 10,000 tons of coal. Liu Changfu, a representative from Tianjin, said that this year's task is arduous, but as long as the masses use their brains to think of ways, it will generate tremendous material strength. For example, the workers of Tianjin Steel Plant proposed to improve the shift system, extending the past eight-hour shutdown to twelve-hour shutdown, so that the machine does not stop and people change shifts. It seems that this small improvement can increase the country's steel production by more than 1,000 tons a year. This year, this factory will be expanded, and its output will increase by hundreds of thousands of tons compared to last year. Huang Rongchang, an industrial labor model from Chongqing 101 Steel Plant, said: After the rectification campaign, new records continue to emerge among the factory's employees. In the past, the lifespan of each open hearth furnace in the factory's small open hearth workshop was generally around 300 heats. In early January, a new record of 500 heats was created. The worker brothers immediately proposed the slogan of marching towards the national highest record of 599 heats. Now it has broken through 600 heats and is advancing rapidly towards 650 heats.

    Diligent Production, Accumulating Sand into Towers, Gathering Streams into Rivers
    Many representatives pointed out that in striving to overfulfill this year's budget and plan, we must focus on the big picture and start with small things. As long as everyone pays attention to increasing income and reducing expenditure, and diligently produces, they can accumulate sand into towers, gather streams into rivers, and do great things. Lü Hongbin, a representative from Shandong Province and a model agricultural worker, said that in order to achieve the target of 650 jin per mu, all the people in his cooperative who can work have been投入投入的热火朝天的积肥热潮，全社今年准备积肥八十多万车（每车四百斤），社员们想出各种办法收集肥料，甚至院子里的秽土也刮进三分. He believes that from the perspective of one cooperative, if everyone in the country does this, it will be a big thing. Chen Shunying, a representative from Hubei Province, said at the meeting that the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Bobai County, Guangxi Province, has saved and stored more than 130,000 jin of food and deposited 75,000 yuan in the bank due to the serious implementation of the principle of diligence and thrift in managing the family. She said that if the people of the whole country seriously implement the principle of building the country and managing the family with diligence and thrift, then we can definitely tap greater potential and make our economic construction cause develop more, faster, and better. Guo Cheng, a representative from Guangxi Province, demanded to tap potential from all aspects and practice strict economy. He said that as long as we can save one fen, we should try our best to save it. In the spirit of this, administrative expenses can also be reduced. The original provision in Guangxi Province was that the office expenses for each district-level cadre was three yuan per month. The result of Guixian County's implementation in 1957 was two yuan and five jiao per person per month. This year, it is considered that two yuan and two jiao is almost enough. Peng Yangqin, deputy director of Wuhan Electric Power Bureau and a representative from Hubei Province, talked about such a thing. Because Wuhan Electric Power Bureau's subordinate units carried out a large-scale warehouse cleanup last winter and this spring, this year's partial basic construction projects and all the equipment and raw materials needed for production in the bureau can basically be solved by relying on inventory. He said that if a large-scale warehouse cleanup is carried out throughout the country, a large amount of construction funds can definitely be saved and more construction tasks can be completed.

    The representatives mentioned that in order to complete and overfulfill the national plan, it is of great significance to vigorously develop local industries. Representatives from Yunnan, Guangxi, Hubei, Shandong, and other provinces have spoken very enthusiastically about this issue. They believe that as long as the local finances at all levels earnestly increase income and reduce expenditure, and engage in construction in the spirit of spending less money and doing more things, local industries can definitely achieve a leap forward development in 1958.

    In the group discussions, the representatives praised the national budget and the national economic plan for this year with incomparable excitement. The representatives said that these documents are full of light, and from here we see that our nation has great potential, and our country is speeding forward on the socialist track.

　　带动广大人民干一番轰轰烈烈的事业
    人民代表在小组讨论中纷纷表示决心
    新华社4日讯　国务院向全国人民代表大会第五次会议提出的1958年国家预算草案和国民经济年度计划草案，给人们指出了一个令人鼓舞的光辉的前景，这新的一年将是史无前例的建设大跃进的一年，能否完成和超额完成预算和计划所提出的指标，代表们在小组讨论时一致作了坚决的肯定的答复。
    在3日和4日上午，代表们分组讨论了李先念副总理和薄一波副总理所作的报告，他们同意这些报告，认为全国人民经过了整风和反右派斗争，社会主义觉悟大大提高，革命大跃进的气势壮如山河，国家的预算和年度经济计划已经估计到了群众的无穷无尽的力量，群众伟大的积极性和创造性，代表们表示决心要在这新的一年带动广大人民干出一番轰轰烈烈的大事业。
    我们的国家有伟大的潜力
    不少代表提出，我们伟大的国家还有伟大的潜力可挖。山东、湖北、四川、辽宁、广西、天津等省市的代表指出，只要放手地发动群众挖掘各方面的潜力，就有足够的把握来克服各种困难，超额完成今年的计划。山东省有的代表谈到，这个省去年遭到严重的自然灾害，全省人多地少，今年粮食供应比较紧张，可是全省农民具有空前高涨的革命积极性和顽强的斗争性，他们不在困难面前低头，有的提出每亩作物产量要一年超过五百斤，三年跨过长江南。全省1958年粮食产量原计划达到三百二十亿斤，比去年增加六十亿斤，经过群众讨论以后，今年不但有把握完成三百二十亿斤，而且要争取达到三百五十亿斤，比去年增长34％。湖北省代表、农业劳动模范蔡以田在讨论中列举了许多生动的事例，说明只要领导上认真依靠群众，就一定能够克服各种困难，超额完成今年的生产建设计划。他说，他所在的谷城县附近有一条大河，这条河因为在开发水利时有着许多困难条件，过去几千年来从没有人加以利用，在去冬今春大兴水利的热潮中，这个县的农民已经修了四条大河渠，其中一条要通过一道悬崖，要开凿一道很长的山洞，修建一座很宽很高的拦河坝。蔡以田说，像这样巨大的工程，过去是做梦也不敢想的。
    今年计划一定能超额完成
    全国工业劳动模范王崇伦、张子富肯定地认为，今年的国家预算和国民经济计划是一定能够超额完成的。王崇伦说，鞍钢工人革命干劲很大，他所在的工具车间的工人在讨论今年生产计划时，工人们提出了许多改善生产的建议，初步计划要提前一个半月完成今年的生产计划。张子富说，抚顺煤矿工人有充分信心完成国家计划，现在矿工们都积极想办法挖掘生产潜力，今年1月上半月，全矿已经超产煤炭一万多吨。天津市代表刘长福说，今年的任务是繁重的，可是只要群众开动脑筋想办法，就会产生巨大的物质力量。例如天津钢厂的工人们提出改进交班制，把过去每八小时停车一次延长到十二小时停车一次，做到机器不停人换班，看来这样一点小的改进，一年就可以为国家多增产一千多吨钢。今年这个厂要扩建，产量要比去年增加几十万吨。重庆一○一钢铁厂工业劳动模范黄荣昌说：他们厂的职工在整风以后，新纪录不断出现。这个厂里的小平炉车间，过去每届平炉的寿命一般是三百炉左右，1月上旬就创造了炉龄五百炉的新纪录，工人兄弟马上又提出向全国最高纪录五百九十九炉进军的口号，现在已经突破了六百炉，正向六百五十炉猛进。
    勤俭生产，积沙成塔，汇溪成河
    许多代表提出，在争取超额完成今年的预算和计划时，要从大处着眼，小处着手，只要大家注意开源节流，勤俭生产，就能够积沙成塔，汇溪涧以成江河，做出伟大的事情。山东省代表，农业劳动模范吕鸿宾说，他所在的合作社为了达到亩产六百五十斤的指标，全社所有能干活的人都投入了热火朝天的积肥热潮，全社今年准备积肥八十多万车（每车四百斤），社员们想出各种办法收集肥料，甚至院子里的秽土也刮进三分。他认为，从一社看全国，大家都这样干，就是大事情了。湖北省代表陈舜英在会上谈到，广西省博白县“五一”农业合作社由于认真贯彻勤俭持家的方针，这个社的全体社员已节约储存下口粮十三万多斤，在银行储蓄了七万五千元的存款。她说，如果全国人民都认真贯彻勤俭建国与勤俭持家的方针，那一定可以挖掘出更大的潜力，使我们的经济建设事业得到更多更快更好的发展。广西省代表郭城要求从各方面挖掘潜力，厉行节约，他说，只要能节省一分钱都要尽量节省，本着这个精神，行政费的开支还可以减少，广西省原规定区级干部每人每月的办公费是三元，贵县1957年执行的结果是每人每月二点五元，今年考虑二点二元就差不多了。湖北省代表、武汉电业局副局长彭仰钦谈到这样一件事情，武汉电业局所属各单位由于在去冬今春进行了一次仓库大清理，今年这个局的部分基本建设工程和全部生产上所需要的设备和原材料，就基本上可以依靠库存解决。他说，如果全国都来进行一次仓库大清理，就一定可以节约大量建设资金，完成更多的建设任务。
    代表们谈到，为了完成和超额完成国家计划，大力发展地方工业有重要的意义。云南、广西、湖北、山东等省的代表都非常热心地谈到了这个问题，他们认为，只要各级地方财政实行认真的开源节流，并且以少花钱，多办事的精神从事建设，地方工业在1958年就一定可以得到一个飞跃的发展。
    在小组会的讨论中，代表们以无比兴奋的心情歌颂了国家的预算，歌颂了今年度的国民经济计划，代表们说，在这些文件上字字放光明，从这里看到了我们的民族大有可为，我们的国家正在社会主义的轨道上向前飞奔。
