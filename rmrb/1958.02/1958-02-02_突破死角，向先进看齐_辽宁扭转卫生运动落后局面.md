　　Breaking Through Dead Ends, Learning from the Advanced
    Liaoning Reverses Backwardness in the Public Health Campaign
    (This report) The Liaoning Provincial People's Committee recently made a resolution calling on the people of the province to catch up, overcome backwardness, and immediately launch a mass patriotic health campaign to eliminate the "Four Pests," requiring that Liaoning be transformed into a "Four-Without" province within five years. Shenyang City is to become a "Four-Without" city within three years. Currently, forty-two cities and counties in the province have begun to take action and are marching towards the "Four Pests." According to statistics from ten cities and counties, 1.43 million rats and sparrows have been eliminated. The main key to whether the province's public health campaign can be launched quickly lies in whether the leadership work is in-depth and specific. The current situation is: wherever the leadership attaches importance to and personally takes action, the campaign is carried out well; conversely, the campaign cannot be launched. Party and government leaders in Lushun-Dalian and Liaoyang cities frequently go deep into the grassroots to inspect and supervise, making the public health campaign a regular practice. Mosquitoes and flies have been basically eliminated in these two cities. Rats have also been basically eliminated in the Dalian area. Shenyang City's public health work was not good enough in the past, but now, due to the leadership's tight grasp and full mobilization of the masses, the situation has improved. Some factories and schools that did not pay attention to the public health campaign have also taken action after being criticized. However, due to the lack of in-depth leadership work in Benxi and Anshan cities, with more general calls and less specific work, the public health campaign has not yet been widely launched. Unhygienic phenomena are still very serious in Benxi City. Currently, the urban public health campaign in the province is generally better than in rural areas, and some counties have not yet taken action until now. The party and government leaders of these counties regard the public health campaign as a trivial matter, thinking that carrying out the public health campaign is making a big fuss over a small issue. Some counties even kept the instructions on carrying out the public health campaign in drawers, failing to arrange them in a timely manner. The Zhuanghe County Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has not held a meeting for more than a year. Some cadres in the health departments of some counties have been transferred to do other work. The main problem in doing a good job in the rural public health campaign is to strengthen propaganda work and integrate the public health campaign well with agricultural production. Some counties, such as Jin County, Changtu County, and Yingkou County, have already seen dozens of mosquito- and fly-free villages due to doing a good job in accumulating fertilizer and water. Some areas that did not have pig pens and toilets in the past have now changed this situation, and hygiene work is also better than in the past.

　　突破死角，向先进看齐
    辽宁扭转卫生运动落后局面
    本报讯　辽宁省人民委员会最近做出决议，号召全省人民迎头赶上，战胜落后，立即掀起全民性的除四害讲卫生运动，要求在五年内把辽宁变成四无省。沈阳市要在三年内实现四无城。现在全省已有四十二个市、县开始行动起来，向四害进军。据十个市县的统计，被消灭的鼠雀已达一百四十三万只。目前全省卫生运动能否很快展开的主要关键，在于领导工作是否深入具体。现在的情况是：凡是领导重视亲自动手的地区，运动就开展得好，反之，运动就展不开。旅大、辽阳两市党政领导人员经常深入下层，检查督促，使得卫生运动做到经常化。这两个城市已经基本上消灭了蚊蝇。大连地区的老鼠也基本上被消除。沈阳市过去卫生工作不够好，现在由于领导抓得紧，充分发动群众，情况已有好转。一些不重视卫生运动的工厂和学校受到批评以后，也都行动起来。但是，本溪、鞍山两市由于领导工作不深入，一般号召多，具体的工作少，因此卫生运动至今未能普遍展开。本溪市不卫生的现象还很严重。现在全省城市卫生运动，一般还比农村开展得好一些，有些县直到现在尚未行动起来。这些县的党政领导人员把卫生运动看成是小事情，认为开展卫生运动是小题大作。个别县甚至把关于开展卫生运动的指示，压在抽屉里，未及时往下布置。庄河县爱国卫生运动委员会一年多来没有召开过一次会议。有些县卫生部门的干部，被调去做别的工作。目前搞好农村卫生运动的主要问题，是要加强宣传工作，把卫生运动和农业生产很好结合起来。有些县，例如金县、昌图县和营口县，因为做好积肥、积水等工作，已经出现了几十个无蝇蚊的村屯。一些过去没有猪圈、厕所的地区，现在改变了这种状况，卫生工作也比过去好多了。
