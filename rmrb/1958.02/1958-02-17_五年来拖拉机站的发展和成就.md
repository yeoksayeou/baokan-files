Small Reference Material:

In the first Five-Year Plan period, the work of agricultural machinery tractor stations in China developed rapidly and achieved great success. By the end of 1957, there were 383 tractor stations across the country, possessing more than 12,000 standard tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per standard tractor), with a total cultivated area of more than 26 million mu, exceeding the original targets of the first Five-Year Plan by nearly one time, more than three times, and more than six times respectively.

Many facts have proven that under the same conditions of land cultivation and field management, the yield of machine-cultivated land is higher than that of animal-cultivated land. Generally speaking, wheat fields increase production by 20-30 jin per mu, coarse grains by 40-60 jin, rice by 40-100 jin, and cotton by 6-10 jin (lint). In 1957, thirteen stations, including the eastern suburbs of Tianjin, Xingping and Hanzhong in Shaanxi Province, Anyang in Henan Province, and Pixian in Sichuan Province, had already reached or exceeded the agricultural development program targets for all machine-cultivated grain fields in their service areas. Among the thirty-seven stations in Dunhuang in Gansu Province, Cixi in Zhejiang Province, etc., the current yield of all machine-cultivated cotton fields has reached 100 to 146 jin, 80 to 100 jin, and 60 to 80 jin in some cases.

The use of mechanical cultivation has increased the yield per unit area, and the net income of agricultural cooperatives has also increased relatively. The percentage of net income from machine cultivation to the increased output value for agricultural cooperatives is: generally around 70% for cotton and rice, around 50% for wheat, and around 30% to 40% for coarse grains.

In the past five years, the internal management of tractor stations has been improved and enhanced year by year. The number of operational items has increased year by year, the efficiency of machinery has increased year by year, and the operating costs have decreased year by year. In the past five years, tractor stations have also achieved certain results in cultivating cadres, accumulating experience in running stations, and in the experimental research, modification, and creation of agricultural machinery.

    五年来拖拉机站的发展和成就
    第一个五年计划期间我国农业机器拖拉机站工作发展迅速，成绩很大。截至1957年底，全国已有拖拉机站三百八十三处，拥有拖拉机一万二千多标准台（每标准台十五马力计算），机耕面积达二千六百多万亩，比第一个五年计划原定的指标分别超过了近一倍、三倍多和六倍多。
    许多事实证明：在土地栽培和田间管理等条件完全相同的情况下，机耕地较畜耕地的产量要高。一般情况是，每亩麦田增产二十—三十斤，杂粮增产四十—六十斤，水稻增产四十—一百斤，棉花增产六—十斤（皮棉）。1957年已有天津东郊，陕西省兴平、汉中，河南省安阳，四川省郫县等十三个站，服务区全部机耕粮田已经达到或超过农业发展纲要指标。甘肃省敦煌、浙江省慈溪等三十七个站的全部机耕棉田目前有的达到一百斤到一百四十六斤，有的达到八十斤到一百斤，有的达到六十斤到八十斤。
    使用机械耕作，提高了单位面积产量，农业社的纯收益也相对增加。农业社由于机耕所得的纯收益占增产产值的百分比是：棉花、水稻一般70％左右，小麦50％左右，杂粮30％到40％左右。
    五年来，拖拉机站内部的经营管理工作逐年改善和提高。作业项目逐年增多，机具效率逐年提高，作业成本逐年下降。五年来拖拉机站在培养干部、积累办站经验和对农业机具的试验研究、改装创造等方面也都获得了一定成绩。
