　　The Second Little Five-Year Plan

    The Young Pioneers of Sanguanxunzi Township, Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province, having successfully completed their first little five-year plan, have recently formulated a second little five-year plan. The main content of the plan is in response to the national call to advance into the mountainous areas, change the face of the mountainous rural areas, and achieve the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, as well as the county's call to reach the production level of prosperous middle peasants within two years. According to the plan, all Young Pioneers will actively participate in agricultural production, build mountainous areas, and green the mountainous areas without affecting their studies, and will help their families with sideline production and actively participate in social activities.

    In order to realize the second little five-year plan, the Young Pioneers actively participate in agricultural production activities such as collecting firewood, delivering manure, repairing valley dams, and collecting manure. This is the Young Pioneer Brigade Leader Liang Ruiyun and Gong Guixia collecting manure.              　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Gao Guoquan photographed
