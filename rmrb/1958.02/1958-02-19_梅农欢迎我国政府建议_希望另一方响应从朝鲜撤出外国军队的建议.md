Indian Defence Minister Menon expressed welcome in Bombay on the evening of the 17th to the Chinese government's proposal for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. He said, "This is important news." He said, "If the other party responds to this proposal, it will be a great force for peace."

Speaking at a public gathering at Kykana Square, Menon said that China is willing to withdraw its troops from North Korea as a step towards easing tensions in the region.

The Indian Defence Minister praised the Chinese people as peace-loving people. He said that the Chinese people are building a new country. He emphasized that this country should be given its due place in international affairs.

Referring to the international situation, Menon said that the main problem facing the world today is the issue of disarmament.

He said that India has made efforts in this regard in the past two or three years.

    梅农在京卡纳广场举行的公众集会上说，中国愿意从朝鲜北部撤出军队作为缓和这个地区的紧张局势的一个步骤。
    印度国防部长赞扬中国人民是爱好和平的人民。他说，中国人民正在建设新的国家。他强调指出，这个国家应该在国际场合得到应有的地位。
    提到国际形势时，梅农说，目前世界所面临的主要问题是裁军问题。美苏不达成协议，真正裁军就没有可能。问题是“要使它们到一个房间里去”。他说，印度在过去两三年中在这方面作了努力。
