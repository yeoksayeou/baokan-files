    Western Press Clippings

    Too Small
    Even for trained observers, America's first artificial satellite has proven difficult to see.
    Since the Army's "Explorer" was launched into orbit, more than two hundred observation teams at home and abroad have been searching for it.
    As of midnight yesterday, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had received a total of eight observation reports... only three of which were deemed useful for the Observatory's calculation of the satellite's orbit.

    A Clever Way to Reconcile Class Contradictions
    A vicar said yesterday that every employer should use the Christian name to call his workers.
    The venerable Archdeacon Eli Trias, Vicar of Halifax in Yorkshire, wrote in the "Current Affairs Monthly": I firmly believe that a man who is called Smith by his boss will instinctively feel uncomfortable, because it will remind him of the different social status between him and his boss.

    即使对受过训练的观测员来说，美国的第一颗人造卫星证明是很难看得见的。
    自从陆军的“探险者”射入轨道之后，设在国内外的二百多个观测队都在寻找它。
    截至昨天午夜，在马萨诸塞州剑桥的史密斯逊天文观测台共收到八份观测报告……其中只有三份被认为对天文观测台计算卫星轨道有用。

    调和阶级矛盾妙法
    一位副主教昨天说，每一位雇主应该用教名来称呼他的工人。
    约克郡哈里发斯的教区牧师和副主教，年高德劭的埃立·特里亚斯在“时事通信月刊”上写道：我深信一个被他的老板叫唤为史密斯的人会本能地感到不痛快，因为这样会使他想起他和他的老板之间不同的社会地位。
