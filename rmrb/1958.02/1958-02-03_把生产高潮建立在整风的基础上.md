　　Building the Production Upsurge on the Foundation of Rectification
　　Jing Yu
    No one opposes the slogan of "rectification and production without neglecting either," but deviations often occur in actual work.

    The No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel once focused solely on the production upsurge, neglecting rectification. As a result: First, 10% of the problems were not thoroughly resolved; second, some problems that had been solved deteriorated again because no consolidation measures were taken. Consequently, the leadership had to regroup and launch a new rectification upsurge.

    Why did this happen? This is a problem of work, but even more so, a problem of ideology. Many people do not understand that the emergence of a production upsurge—that is, the full realization of productive forces—will only come when the constraints of production relations are broken through, paving the way for broad development.

    The enterprise rectification movement, on the one hand, carries out socialist education among the working class, raises the workers' awareness, and unites the workers' ranks, which is necessary. However, on the other hand, and more importantly, it aims to rectify the bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism of leading cadres, adjust the relationship between leaders and the masses, and improve all outdated management systems. In other words, it is necessary to use rectification methods to adjust the contradiction between the superstructure and the economic base, adjust the new production relations, and pave the way for the full realization of productive forces. In this sense, leading the production upsurge and thorough rectification cannot be separated and are inseparable.

    Since liberation, the production of China's industrial and mining enterprises has developed under the continuous changes in production relations. The democratic reforms of factories and enterprises in 1950 overthrew the old feudal rule, changed the management system, liberated productive forces, and led to the production recovery upsurge in 1951; in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956, the nationwide socialist transformation movement of the three major industries changed the ownership of the means of production of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, established new production relations suitable for the development of productive forces, and led to the great leap forward in production in 1956 and a new production upsurge. However, this does not mean that all problems have been solved. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Socialist relations of production have been established, and they are adapted to the development of productive forces; however, they are still very imperfect, and these imperfect aspects are contradictory to the development of productive forces. In addition to the situation of adaptation and contradiction between production relations and the development of productive forces, there is also the situation of adaptation and contradiction between the superstructure and the economic base. ...The existence of bourgeois ideology, the existence of certain bureaucratic styles in state organs, and the existence of defects in certain links of the state system are contradictory to the socialist economic base." How to solve these contradictions? According to China's specific conditions, the best way is rectification. How to promote the development of productive forces? The most important way is to build the production upsurge on the foundation of rectification.

    Currently, a socialist production and construction upsurge is forming across the country. The spirit of comparing with the advanced and comparing with enthusiasm is growing. Due to the uneven progress of the rectification movement in various regions, some are engaging in vigorous airing of views, some are engaging in great debates, some are reviewing and rectifying, and some are engaging in thematic airing of views and in-depth rectification. This situation is also reflected in production enthusiasm. From the perspective of specific factories and mines, it cannot be assumed that just because a nationwide production upsurge is forming, one should disregard the specific conditions of one's own factory and simply echo the call for an upsurge. If the rectification progress in some regions or some factories and mining enterprises is relatively slow, the socialist awareness of the masses has not been raised, the enterprise management has not been improved, and the internal relations have not been adjusted, then such factories should not be talking about any upsurge problem, but rather vigorously rectifying to promote the arrival of the upsurge.

### 把生产高潮建立在整风的基础上

　　把生产高潮建立在整风的基础上
　　静宇
    整风和生产两不误，这个口号是没有人反对的，然而，在实际工作中，却往往发生偏差。
    鞍钢第一炼钢厂曾经单抓生产高潮，放松了整改。结果是：第一、有10％的问题改得不彻底；第二、部分已解决的问题因为没有采取巩固的措施，情况又变坏了。于是，领导上只好重整旗鼓，掀起整改高潮。
    为什么会产生这种情况呢？这是工作问题，更是思想问题。很多人不了解：生产高潮的出现——也就是生产力的充分发挥，只有在冲破了生产关系的约束、为自己开辟了广阔的发展道路的时候才会到来。
    企业整风运动，一方面是在工人阶级中进行社会主义教育，提高工人的觉悟，团结工人的队伍，这是必要的。但是，另一方面，更主要的是要整掉领导干部的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，调整领导和群众的关系，改进一切陈旧的管理制度。也就是说，要用整风的办法，来调整上层建筑和经济基础的矛盾，调整新的生产关系，为生产力的充分发挥开辟道路。在这个意义上说来，领导生产高潮和彻底整风是不能分开，也无法分开的。
    解放以来，我国工矿企业的生产是在不断改变生产关系的情况下发展的。1950年工厂企业的民主改革，推翻了旧的封建统治，改变了管理制度，解放了生产力，出现了1951年恢复生产的高潮；1955年冬和1956年春，全国范围的社会主义三大改造运动，改变了农业、手工业、私营工商业的生产所有制，建立了新的适合于生产力发展的生产关系，出现了1956年的生产大跃进和新的生产高潮。但是，这还不是所有的问题都已解决了。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中指出：“社会主义生产关系已经建立起来，它是和生产力的发展相适应的；但是，它又还很不完善，这些不完善的方面和生产力的发展又是相矛盾的。除了生产关系和生产力发展的这种又相适应又相矛盾的情况以外，还有上层建筑和经济基础的又相适应又相矛盾的情况。……资产阶级意识形态的存在，国家机构中的某些官僚主义作风的存在，国家制度中某些环节上缺陷的存在，又是和社会主义的经济基础相矛盾的。”怎么解决这些矛盾呢？根据我国的具体情况，最好的办法就是整风。怎样推动生产力的发展呢？最重要的办法也是把生产高潮建立在整风的基础上。
    目前，全国社会主义的生产和建设高潮正在形成。比先进、比干劲的精神日益增涨。由于各地整风运动的进度参差不齐，有的在大鸣大放，有的在大辩论，有的复查整改，有的在专题鸣放，深入整改。这种情况反映在生产情绪上也就不会一样，从具体厂矿说来，不能认为全国性的生产高潮正在形成，就不顾本厂具体情况也跟着叫喊高潮。如果部分地区或部分厂矿企业整风进度较迟，群众的社会主义觉悟没有提高，企业管理工作也没有改进，内部关系还没有调整，这样的工厂不是叫喊什么高潮问题，而是大力整改，促进高潮的到来。
