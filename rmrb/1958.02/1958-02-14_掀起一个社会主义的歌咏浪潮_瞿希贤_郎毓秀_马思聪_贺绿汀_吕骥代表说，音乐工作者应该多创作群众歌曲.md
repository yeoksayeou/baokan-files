Launch a Socialist Singing Upsurge
	Qu Xixian, Lang Yuxiu, Ma Sicong, He Luting, and Lü Ji representatives said that musicians should create more mass songs.
	We completely agree with the four reports of the conference.
	After listening to these reports and the speeches of representatives from various work posts, we feel that a great socialist construction upsurge has arrived, and the revolutionary vigor of the masses, like liberated atomic energy, is emitting unparalleled power. Facing this new situation of riding the wind and waves, we musicians are both excited and ashamed, because our work has not been done well. We must catch up.
	
	The mass singing movement is in a state of "three no's" self-generation and self-destruction. The masses have a lot of opinions about not having songs to sing.
	The people need to move forward singing songs. Many young people question us, "Why are there no good songs?" "We have no songs to sing." Many middle-aged people also question us, "The anti-Japanese songs from the past were really energetic, why don't you write more songs now that can inspire people's enthusiasm?" Indeed, our masses have a tradition of singing revolutionary songs, from the First Revolutionary Civil War to the War of Resistance, to the War of Liberation, the people were singing songs to fight. Can we not sing songs today when we are engaged in socialist construction?
	In the past, singing revolutionary songs was a crime, but our music warriors risked their lives to spread these revolutionary seeds. The material conditions in the past were very poor, and the lives of the masses were very hard, but we had to mobilize and organize the masses to sing even with our bare hands. Now? Our material conditions are much better, and we have a large number of professional talents, but we are alienated from the masses. In the first few years after liberation, the mass singing movement was still developing vigorously, but after 1953, the song movement fell into a state of laissez-faire. The Mass Art Center is responsible for carrying out mass singing, but some Mass Art Centers are detached from the masses and close their doors to improve themselves. The local music associations, due to the emphasis on division of labor, have not managed this matter. Professional groups, due to the emphasis on improvement, have not paid attention to guiding the amateur musical activities of the masses. In short, the mass singing movement is in a state of "three no's" self-generation and self-destruction.
	
	If socialism does not occupy the position of literature and art, bourgeois culture will develop greatly there. Musicians should produce healthy musical works that are welcomed by the people to defeat reactionary yellow music.
	
	Is it okay if we don't manage? No, it's not. In the literary and art position, if socialism does not occupy it, the declining bourgeois culture will develop greatly there. In the past two years, yellow songs have spread like bacteria to these corners lacking sunshine. "Manchurian Girl," "China Night," and "When Will You Return" these decadent and reactionary songs have actually captured many young workers and young cadres. The black market for yellow song records has reached as high as twenty yuan a piece, and people are still scrambling to buy them. Comrades, don't think that everything is fine after the anti-Rightist struggle. On the literary and art front, there is still a serious class struggle waiting for us. If we cannot produce healthy musical works that are welcomed by the people to defeat it, the decadent and pornographic so-called "yellow music" will further erode our ranks.
	
	With the rise of socialist construction, the cultural demands of the vast number of peasants are becoming increasingly urgent. More musicians should go to the countryside to help them carry out cultural and artistic activities. In cities and industrial and mining areas, the mass singing movement should also be vigorously developed. Professional musicians have the responsibility to go to the mass singing groups to provide guidance.
	
	Fighting yellow music is only one aspect of the work of musicians. We must see that with the emergence of the high tide of socialist construction, a cultural high tide will appear. For example, in the countryside, the peasants are becoming more and more energetic, and the peasants' demands for cultural life are becoming more and more urgent. In the upsurge of repairing water conservancy and accumulating fertilizer, the peasants themselves have created many poems. Many agricultural production cooperatives have evening parties on their monthly "Love the Cooperative Day" to perform various cultural and artistic programs. They urgently need to sing, and they welcome small programs with singing and dancing. They are not satisfied with the ones they have compiled themselves, and they enthusiastically ask literary and art workers to help them revise and sort them out, create more literary and artistic works for them, and help them carry out cultural and artistic activities.
	The face of the countryside is undergoing great changes. It is not only that a mountain is being moved here and a river is being added there, but the spiritual outlook of the countryside has undergone profound changes. Middle school graduates returning to their hometowns to engage in agricultural labor, retired and transferred soldiers, and millions of cadres sent to lower levels are bringing new culture to the countryside. With the implementation of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, the speed at which farmers master culture will be greatly accelerated.
	The industrial sector is producing a large number of fertilizers, new agricultural tools, and daily necessities needed for production to supply the countryside. Musicians, what have we done for the countryside? Now some musicians have gone up the mountains and down to the countryside. Most of them can shoulder the task of enlivening the rural music life in addition to labor training. It is hoped that while they are reforming their ideology, they will strive to engage in musical creation to meet the needs of the broad masses of people. First of all, it is to adapt to the needs of the countryside. We hope that more musicians will go to the countryside, and every musician should spend a certain amount of time living and working in the countryside. Those who stay in the city should also be linked to the singing teams of cooperatives or factories to help them in singing activities.
	The mass singing movement in rural areas, cities, and industrial and mining areas should be vigorously carried out. The experience of leading cadres in Hong'an County going to the countryside to conduct experimental fields has also inspired us. Our professional musicians all have the responsibility to go to mass singing groups to provide guidance. During the War of Resistance, Comrade Xian Xinghai was an active organizer of the singing movement. He personally directed the rehearsal and performance of many song groups. The songs he wrote were often sung through his own guidance. Because of these practices, the composer better understood the requirements of the singers for the songs, and was directly infected by the thoughts and feelings of the masses when they sang. It is also beneficial for singers and instrumentalists to do tutoring work for their singing and playing. This kind of connection between professional workers and music lovers is a vivid artistic practice, and this kind of exchange of thoughts and feelings will stimulate our artistic creation.
	
	The problem at present is not that there are no songs, but that there are not many good songs, or the mood is not right, or they are not pleasant to listen to, so the masses do not like to sing. Therefore, composers must go deep into life, understand the needs of the masses, and improve their ability to express themselves.
	
	In order to carry out the singing movement, the most important thing is to have works. There are more than 20 kinds of publications in the country, with more than 200 new songs every month. With so many songs, why is there no singing? There are two problems here: one is that there are not many good songs, or the mood is not right, or they are not pleasant to listen to, so the masses do not like to sing. Therefore, composers must go deep into life, understand the needs of the masses, and improve the ideological and artistic level of their works. The other aspect is the problem of promotion. Some better songs have not received the due introduction and promotion and have been buried. In 1951 and 1952, several songs were promoted nationwide on "May Day" and "October 1st." At that time, the whole country was indeed singing, of course, we may not necessarily adopt the method of national promotion now, but if the radio stations of provinces and cities can focus on introducing several songs every year, it will still play a great role in carrying out singing and promoting creation. After we wholeheartedly participate in labor training in rural factories and conscientiously reform our thoughts and feelings, we will be able to produce several mass songs that are loved by the people of the whole country. In recent years, professional composers have paid more attention to large-scale works and relaxed the creation of mass songs and light music and dance music. The people need various forms and diverse works with different contents to reflect our rich and colorful life. But at any time, we must not forget popularization work, which is the foundation and is directly related to the cultural food of hundreds of millions of people. We hope that in the creative plans of professional composers, there should be a certain proportion of mass songs and light music, and first of all, we must attach importance to it and love it ideologically.
	
	Let us launch a socialist revolutionary singing upsurge!
	Let us sing out the revolutionary vigor of workers and peasants across the country in building socialism, and let everyone sing with even greater enthusiasm!

    掀起一个社会主义的歌咏浪潮
    瞿希贤　郎毓秀　马思聪　贺绿汀　吕骥代表说，音乐工作者应该多创作群众歌曲
    我们完全同意大会的四个报告。
    听了这几个报告再加上各地各个工作岗位上代表的发言，我们感到伟大的社会主义建设高潮已经来到了，群众的革命干劲像解放了的原子能似的正在发出无比的威力。我们音乐工作者，面对这乘风破浪的新局面，一方面是兴奋，一方面是惭愧，因为我们的工作没有作好。必须迎头赶上。
    群众歌咏运动处在三不管自生自灭的状态，群众对没有歌唱很有意见。
    人民是需要唱着歌前进的。很多青年责问我们“为什么没有好歌”“我们没有歌唱”。很多中年人也责问我们“从前那些抗战歌曲真带劲，为什么现在你们不多写些能鼓舞起人们干劲的歌呢？”的确，我们的群众是有唱革命歌曲的传统的，从第一次国内革命战争时期到抗战、到解放战争，人民都是唱着歌去战斗的，难道今天搞社会主义建设就可以不唱歌吗？
    从前唱革命歌曲是犯罪的，可是我们音乐战士冒着生命危险传播这些革命种子。从前的物质条件很差，群众的生活很苦，可是我们就是赤手空拳也要发动群众、组织群众来唱歌。现在呢？我们的物质条件好多了，又有了大量的专业人才，但是我们反而脱离群众了。刚解放的几年群众歌咏运动还是蓬勃发展的，可是一九五三年以后，歌运就陷入了自流状态。群众艺术馆是负责开展群众歌咏的，但是有些群众艺术馆脱离群众，关门提高。各地的音协，由于强调分工，也没有管这事。专业团体由于强调提高，更没有把辅导群众业余音乐活动重视起来。总之群众歌咏运动是处在三不管自生自灭的状态。
    文艺这块阵地，如果社会主义不去占领，资产阶级文化就要到那里去大发展。音乐工作者应该拿出为人民喜闻乐见、健康的音乐作品来战胜反动的黄色音乐。
    不管行不行呢？不行。在文艺阵地上，如果社会主义不去占领它，没落的资产阶级文化就会到那儿去大发展了。这两年来黄色歌曲就像细菌一样，到这些缺少阳光的角落去蔓延了。“满洲姑娘”“支那之夜”“何日君再来”这些腐朽的反动的歌曲，居然又俘掳了不少青年职工、青年干部。黄色歌曲唱片的黑市有高到二十元一张的，还有人抢着买。同志们，别再以为反右派斗争以后已经万事大吉了，在文艺战线上，还有一场严重的阶级斗争等着我们。如果我们拿不出为人民喜闻乐见、健康的音乐作品来战胜它，反动的色情的所谓“黄色音乐”的靡靡之音就要进一步来腐融我们的队伍。
    随着社会主义建设的高涨，广大农民的文化要求日益迫切，应该有更多的音乐工作者到农村去帮助他们开展文艺活动。在城市、工矿群众歌咏运动也应该大力开展，专业音乐工作者有责任到群众歌咏团去辅导。
    与黄色音乐作战斗，还只是音乐工作的一个方面。我们必须看到随着社会主义建设高潮的出现，将出现一个文化高潮。比如在农村，现在农民的干劲愈来愈大了，农民对文化生活的要求也愈来愈迫切了。在修水利积肥的热潮中，农民自己已经创作出了不少的诗歌。许多农业生产合作社在每月一次的爱社日都有晚会，表演各种文艺节目。他们迫切需要有歌唱，他们欢迎载歌载舞的小节目。他们不满足于自己编的那一些，他们热烈要求文艺工作者，帮助他们修改整理，为他们创造更多的文艺作品，帮助他们开展文艺活动。
    农村的面貌正在大改变中。不仅是这里搬走一座山、那里新添了一条河，而是农村的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。回乡从事农业劳动的中学毕业生，退伍的转业军人和上百万的下放干部正在把新文化带给农村。随着汉语拼音方案的实施，农民掌握文化的速度还要大大加快。
    工业部门正在大量生产发展生产所需要的肥料、新农具和满足日常生活需要的日用品供给农村。音乐工作者们，我们为农村做了些什么呢？现在有一部分音乐工作者上山下乡去了。他们大多数能在劳动锻炼之外，负担起活跃农村音乐生活工作来。希望他们在思想改造同时，努力从事音乐创造以适合广大人民的需要。首先是适应农村的需要。我们希望有更多的音乐工作者到农村去，每一个音乐工作者应该有一定的时间在农村生活和工作。留在城市里的也要和合作社或工厂的歌咏队挂上钩，在歌咏活动上帮助他们。
    农村、城市、工矿的群众歌咏运动应该大力开展起来。红安县领导干部下乡搞试验田的经验也给了我们启发，我们的专业音乐工作者，都有责任到群众歌咏团体去辅导。抗战期间星海同志就是一位活跃歌咏运动的组织者。他亲自指挥了许多歌团排练、演出。他写的歌曲，常常通过他自己的辅导唱出来。由于这些实践，作曲者就更好地理解到，唱歌的人对歌曲的要求，也直接感染到群众在歌唱时的思想感情。演唱者、乐器演奏者做辅导工作对他们的演唱、演奏也有好处。这种专业工作者与音乐爱好者之间的联系是一种生动的艺术实践，这种思想感情的交流会刺激我们的艺术创作。
    目前的问题不是没有歌，而是好歌不多，或是情绪不对头，或是不动听，因此群众不爱唱，所以作曲者必须深入生活了解群众需要，提高表现能力。
    为了开展歌咏运动，最重要的是要有作品，现在全国有二十多种刊物，每月有二百多首新歌。有这么多歌曲，为什么还没有歌唱呢？这里有两个问题：一个是好歌不多，或是情绪不对头，或是不动听，因此群众不爱唱。所以作曲者必须深入生活了解群众的需要、提高作品的思想水平和艺术水平。另一方面是推广的问题，有些较好的歌没有得到应有的介绍、推广，被埋没了。一九五一年和一九五二年的“五·一”、“十·一”曾经在全国范围内推广了几首歌曲。那时候的确是全国都唱起来了，当然我们现在不一定采用全国推广的办法，但是省、市的广播电台如果能每年重点介绍几首歌曲，那对开展歌咏繁荣创作，还是会起很大的作用的。我们到农村工厂全心全意参加劳动锻炼，认真改造自己的思想感情以后，一定能够产生若干首为全国人民喜爱的群众歌曲来。这几年专业作曲者较多注意大型作品，放松了群众歌曲和轻音乐、跳舞音乐的创作。人民是需要各种不同形式和内容多种多样的作品，来反映我们丰富多彩的生活。但是任何时候都不能忘记普及工作，那是基础，是直接关联到亿万人的文化食粮的问题。我们希望在专业作曲者的创作计划中，要有一定比例的群众歌曲和轻音乐，而且首先要从思想上重视它、热爱它。
    让我们掀起一个社会主义革命歌咏的浪潮来！
    让我们把全国工人和农民建设社会主义的革命干劲唱出来，让大家唱得劲头更大！
