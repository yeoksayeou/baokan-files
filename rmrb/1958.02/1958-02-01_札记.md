    Jottings
    Insidious and Frank
    At the closing session of the Ankara conference, Dulles urged the member states of the Baghdad Pact to be wary of "insidious plans" that "call for easing tensions" and clamored that they must not "relax."
    To actually call the demand for easing international tensions an "insidious plan" is indeed a novel formulation. However, Dulles's willingness to openly express his hostility towards easing international tensions should be considered quite "frank," because not long ago he was still pretending to make people believe that the American ruling group was sincerely willing to ease tensions and pursue peace.
    However, no matter how insidiously the likes of Dulles refuse to "relax," they will hardly be able to stop the world's people from striving to realize their "insidious plan."
    A New Interpretation of Colonialism
    Dulles also has another equally novel argument. According to the French weekly "International Forum," Dulles, in a report to American representatives sent to India, vehemently berated India, saying that India's attempt to reclaim Goa was the act of a "colonizer," while "Portugal is only fighting for the independence of a territory it has possessed for hundreds of years."
    According to Dulles's wonderful logic, then the United States' self-proclaimed status as a bastion of "anti-colonialism" is indeed in accordance with the facts.
    Ignorant Clamor
    The head of the so-called "American Legion," Gleeson, recently published an article clamoring against the recognition of the People's Republic of China. He even believes that the United States made a big mistake when it recognized the Soviet Union more than twenty years ago. This stale clamor will not attract anyone's attention; it can only demonstrate the ignorance and stupidity of this reactionary fellow, Gleeson.
    U.S. Senator Ellender recently published his summary report of his visit to eleven countries, including the Soviet Union. In his report, he said: "Communism will not disappear because we ignore or berate it. It still exists. It is active... It guarantees good living conditions for all people..." Ellender's insights are very instructive for the likes of Gleeson. In today's America, there is more than one ignoramus like Gleeson.

    札记
    阴险和坦率
    杜勒斯在安卡拉会议的闭幕会议上要巴格达集团成员国警惕“要求缓和紧张局势”的“阴险的计划”，大声疾呼不能“松弛下来”。
    居然把缓和国际紧张局势的要求说成是“阴险的计划”，这倒是一种别开生面的提法。不过，杜勒斯敢于公开表达对于缓和国际紧张局势的敌视，倒应该说是相当“坦率”的，因为就在不久以前他还装模作样要人相信，美国统治集团才是真心愿意缓和紧张局势和和平的。
    但是，不管杜勒斯之流如何阴险地拒绝“松弛下来”，也势难阻挡世界人民争取实现他们的“阴险计划”。
    殖民主义新解
    杜勒斯另外还有一种也同样是别开生面的论调。据法国“国际论坛”周刊报道，杜勒斯在一次对派往印度的美国代表所作的报告中十分激动地谩骂印度，说印度要收回果阿是“殖民者”的作法，而“葡萄牙只是为自己在好几百年以来就拥有的一块领土的独立而斗争”。
    按照杜勒斯这样奇妙的逻辑，那末美国自诩为“反殖民主义”的堡垒，确是合乎事实的。
    愚昧的叫嚣
    所谓“美国退伍军人团”的头目格利逊最近发表文章，叫嚣反对承认中华人民共和国。他甚至认为美国在二十多年前承认苏联是做了一件大错事。这种毫不新鲜的嚷叫是不会引起什么人重视的，它只能表现格利逊这个反动家伙的愚昧无知。
    美国参议员埃伦德最近发表了他访问包括苏联在内的十一个国家的总结报告，他在报告中说了这样一段话：“共产主义不会因为我们无视或者谩骂而消失。它仍然存在。它在活动着……它保障了全体人民良好的生活条件……”。埃伦德的这一点心得，对于格利逊之流，倒是很有教益的。在今天的美国，像格利逊那样的愚昧者并不止一个。
