Build Water Conservancy Projects, Conserve Water and Soil, Change the Face of Drought
Gansu Strives to Basically Achieve Water Conservancy in Three Years

The greatest obstacle to the water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation movement in Gansu comes from people's right-leaning conservative thinking. The development process of Gansu's water conservancy and soil and water conservation cause is also a process of continuous struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking. First, there must be a great leap forward in ideology before there can be a great leap forward in work. Right-leaning conservative thinking can only drag us back, blunt our fighting spirit, frustrate our will, and bind our thinking. If we do not criticize and overcome it, it will cause serious damage to our cause.

The wisdom and strength of the masses are inexhaustible. As long as they are brought into play, they can create earth-shattering achievements. This is the driving force for us to build socialism, build communism, transform society, and transform nature. We must cherish it very much, protect it with all our strength, and not damage it in the slightest. If we only look upward and not downward, only know how to reach out to the state for this and that, only know how to sigh in the face of difficulties, but do not mobilize the masses, do not rely on the masses, or even do not believe in the masses, point fingers from the sidelines, and pour cold water on the enthusiasm of the masses, the result will inevitably be a drag on the revolutionary cause.

Speech by Delegate Huo Weide

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

Since the last meeting, the people of our country have achieved a series of new victories under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The First Five-Year Plan has been completed and overfulfilled, and the Second Five-Year Plan has entered its first year. Especially after the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, the socialist revolution has won great victories on the political and ideological fronts. The socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the people have generally increased, and a new upsurge, unprecedented in the economic front, especially the agricultural front, is being set off, promoting the leap forward of various construction undertakings on a larger scale and at a faster speed. Seeing such a thriving and prosperous new atmosphere in our country, we are truly filled with infinite joy and encouragement, and full of confidence and hope for the great future.

Last winter and this spring, flowers bloomed everywhere and results were achieved everywhere. The masses contributed their strength, money, materials, and the vast majority of the manpower, material resources, and financial resources needed for the projects were basically solved by the masses themselves. Some successful models, such as diverting water up the mountains, have been widely promoted.

In our Gansu, since last winter, with the victory of the nationwide debate, a vigorous movement of building water conservancy projects and conserving water and soil has first emerged in the vast rural areas. More than 3.4 million farmers formed an army, braving the severe cold and frost, regardless of day and night, and launched a tenacious struggle against nature with the force of thunder. In just three months, they built 5.24 million mu of irrigated land in one go, and more than 2 million mu are under construction. This figure is more than double the original plan to newly build 3.5 million mu of irrigated land this year. An average of more than 50,000 mu of irrigated land is built every day. Soil and water conservation has been completed on more than 9,000 square kilometers, which is almost half of this year's plan. The movement is now developing vigorously. As long as we do not slacken our efforts, do not let the momentum cool down, and add another effort, we are fully confident that the province will newly build 10 million mu of irrigated land and complete more than 20,000 square kilometers of soil and water conservation this year.

The movement of building water conservancy projects and conserving water and soil in Gansu last winter and this spring has taken a big leap forward compared with 1956. First, the scale is larger, the scope is wider, the number of people is greater, flowers bloom everywhere, and results are achieved everywhere. Second, the speed is faster, the quality is better, and more is irrigated now; because we have accepted the experience and lessons of 1956, we have improved the quality of the projects this year, building one mu and making it successful, and it can be irrigated after it is built. Third, the wisdom and strength of the masses have been brought into fuller play, with people contributing their strength, money, and materials. More than 200 million labor days have been invested in water conservancy and soil and water conservation. The masses have raised more than 20 million yuan in this regard. The vast majority of the manpower, material resources, and financial resources needed for the projects are basically solved by the masses themselves, even for some larger projects; at the same time, the inventions and creations of the masses are also richer, improving tools, improving technology, and overcoming many difficulties. More importantly, some successful models have been widely promoted. In particular, after Wushan County's Dongliang Canal pioneered the diversion of water up the mountains, it greatly boosted the confidence of the mountain people in developing water conservancy. In a few months, many places set off a wave of water conservancy going up the mountains. The masses said, "No mountain is higher than our feet, and no ground is frozen enough to freeze our fiery hearts." The masses in Tianshui and Pingliang prefectures built 53 "Dongliang Canals," which can irrigate 3.22 million mu of land. The largest project, the Beiliang Canal, is 100 kilometers long, with an average altitude of more than 1,600 meters, spanning Wushan and Gangu counties. 30,000 people participated in the construction, and it can irrigate about 400,000 mu of land after completion. Such large-scale water conservancy going up the mountains has opened up a new situation for the development of water conservancy in Gansu in the future. In terms of soil and water conservation, the experience of Dengjiabao in Wushan County has been adopted by many places. Now there are 1,138 Dengjiabao in the province, and a "10,000 Dengjiabao" movement is planned to be launched this year.

Breaking through the original plan and pointing to higher targets. When the new plan is realized, the natural appearance and production appearance of Gansu will undergo tremendous changes.

The high tide of building water conservancy projects and conserving water and soil last winter and this spring broke through our original plan and pointed to new peaks. Based on this new situation, combined with the opinions discussed by the masses in various places, our Gansu plans to achieve the following main targets within three years. These targets and bases do not include the areas that will be划归 [huá guī - assigned to the jurisdiction of] the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

Build 25 million mu of irrigated land in three years. Adding the original 12.23 million mu of irrigated land, the province can have 37.23 million mu of irrigated land by 1960, accounting for about 60 percent of the existing 60 million mu of cultivated land, with an average of more than 3.5 mu of irrigated land per person.

Conserve water and soil on 70,000 square kilometers in three years. Adding the original soil and water conservation area of 30,000 square kilometers, the soil and water conservation area will reach 100,000 square kilometers by 1960, which is equal to half of the original soil erosion area of the province.

Afforest 30 million mu and plant grass on 30 million mu in three years. Adding the existing coverage area of 62.77 million mu, the province can have a coverage area of more than 120 million mu by 1960, accounting for 18 percent of the total area of 690 million mu. The grass mentioned here is mainly alfalfa. This is a perennial grass that is drought-resistant and easy to grow. It can be used as forage, fuel, and green manure. It is indeed a rare and precious grass.

The leap forward in agriculture will inevitably drive the leap forward of other undertakings, first of all, local industry, culture, education, and health. We plan to increase the output value of local industry from 150 million yuan in 1957 to 1.2 billion yuan to 1.4 billion yuan in three years, which is an increase of eight to nine times. The proportion of primary school students in school age children will increase from 50 percent in 1957 to 92 percent. Basically eliminate the "seven pests" of rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs, lice, and phlebotomus.

If we achieve these targets within three years, by 1960, the province can basically achieve water conservancy, half of the soil erosion areas in the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin within the territory can be controlled; the greening will also have a good foundation; and the long-term drought threat can be basically eliminated. The backward state of local industry will be greatly changed. Universal primary education can be realized, every commune has a school, and everyone pays attention to hygiene. It is expected that by 1962, the province's grain output can reach about 20 billion jin, more than double the 8.5 billion jin in 1957, with an average output of more than 300 jin per mu, an increase of about 125 jin compared with 1957; the cotton output can reach 2.4 million dan, more than thirteen times more than in 1957, with an average output of 80 jin per mu, an increase of about 33 jin compared with 1957. At the same time, the output value of local industry will also exceed the output value of agriculture, an increase of sixteen to nineteen times compared with 1957. In this way, the natural appearance and production appearance of Gansu will undergo tremendous changes, and we are fully confident that we can realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

The movement of building water conservancy projects and conserving water and soil in Gansu has not been without obstacles from the beginning to the present. There are many objective difficulties, of course, but the biggest resistance comes from people's right-leaning conservative thinking. The development process of Gansu's water conservancy and soil and water conservation cause is also a process of continuous struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking. From the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, due to the criticism of right-leaning conservative thinking and the "Gansu backwardness" theory, 6.34 million mu of irrigated land was built in a few months, exceeding the total amount of irrigated land built in the thousands of years before liberation. However, from the second half of 1956, the evil wind of right-leaning conservatism blew up again. In 1957, it was proposed to newly build 3 million mu of irrigated land, but the task could not be distributed; it was reduced to 2.5 million mu, but it could not be distributed; it was reduced to 2 million mu, but it could not be distributed; it was reduced to 1.5 million mu, but it still could not be distributed; it was reduced to 1.12 million mu, and finally it was set at 1.35 million mu. But by the end of September, only 1.02 million mu had been completed. After this rectification campaign, right-leaning conservative thinking was more forcefully criticized, and the enthusiasm was boosted again, and it was even greater than in the past. In three months, not only was the tail end of 1957 completed, but also more than 5 million mu of irrigated land was newly built. From this, it can be seen that first, there must be a great leap forward in ideology before there can be a great leap forward in work. Right-leaning conservative thinking can only drag us back, blunt our fighting spirit, frustrate our will, and bind our thinking. If we do not criticize and overcome it, it will cause serious damage to our cause. This is what we must always be vigilant about.

Building water conservancy projects and conserving water and soil is actually a serious struggle between man and nature, that is, to bring into play man's initiative to compete with nature for the initiative, so as to use the power of nature to seek benefits for the people. In such a struggle, first of all, we must have the confidence to win and the revolutionary drive to despise and overcome all difficulties and achieve the inevitable result. Conversely, if we lack confidence in transforming nature and always want to wait for the gifts of nature, and do not have the courage to fight against nature, it will inevitably put ourselves in a passive position and be manipulated by nature everywhere. Our Dingxi Prefecture is the driest area. In recent years, due to the development of water conservancy and soil and water conservation work, and the utilization of rainwater, surface water, and groundwater, by 1957, the irrigated land in the prefecture had increased from more than 360,000 mu before liberation to more than 1.61 million mu, and the grain output per mu had increased from 75 jin before liberation to 136 jin. However, Pingliang Prefecture, which has much better natural conditions than Dingxi Prefecture, lacks this drive, and the work of water conservancy and soil and water conservation is far behind. In 1952, the grain yield per mu in Pingliang Prefecture was 13.3 jin higher than that in Dingxi Prefecture, but in 1957, it was 5.6 jin lower than that in Dingxi Prefecture. Looking at Zhangye Prefecture and Yinchuan Prefecture again, both are large-scale water conservancy irrigation areas with similar natural conditions. In 1957, Zhangye Prefecture expanded the irrigation area and increased grain production. The average wheat yield per mu in Zhangye County exceeded 400 jin, and the average cotton yield per mu in Dunhuang County reached 103 jin, both achieving the 1967 targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. However, Yinchuan Prefecture abandoned 140,000 mu of irrigated land and 180,000 mu of dry land in this year, which seriously affected agricultural production. It can be seen that everything depends on human effort, and all achievements are made by people. Only by doing can we seize more things from nature, increase knowledge and talent, gradually grasp the laws of nature, and overcome all difficulties. Lacking this confidence and lacking this drive, we will always be powerless in the face of nature.

If we do not fully bring into play the wisdom and collective strength of the millions of masses, victory is not guaranteed. When Wushan County built the Dongliang Canal to divert water up the mountain, it did not ask the higher authorities for a technical cadre, a penny, or a catty of materials. The manpower, material resources, and financial resources needed were all solved by the masses themselves, and all difficulties were overcome by the masses themselves. The vast majority of water conservancy and soil and water conservation projects in the province were built in this way.

In the struggle to build water conservancy projects, conserve water and soil, and transform nature, if we do not fully bring into play the collective wisdom and collective strength of the millions of masses, victory is not guaranteed. The basic experience of Wushan County in achieving such outstanding achievements in this regard is to follow the mass line, consult with the masses when encountering difficulties, and ask the masses for advice. When repairing the Dongliang Canal, some water conservancy technicians believed that such a difficult project would be difficult to complete without accurate topographic surveys, key geological exploration data, complete comparative designs, meticulous construction organization, and large amounts of investment and ample time. Some people thought that even if these conditions were met, whether the water could be controlled on the mountain was still a big problem. At that time, some people also said, "If you want water to go up the mountain, unless the winch has long vines and the horse has long horns, and the crow grows red ears." However, in front of the masses, all difficulties were overcome. When selecting the route, there were no technicians or surveying instruments. Only a deputy section chief of the water conservancy section from a peasant background took a simple level and organized several experienced peasants to select the route in two days. From route selection to construction, it only took five days. To build the dam entrance, repair culverts and weirs, without cement, the masses used turf to line the stones and dry-laid rubble to replace it. The canal had to cross a mountain ditch 42 meters wide and 22 meters deep. Several old carpenters came up with the idea of building a wooden frame and building an aqueduct on it to carry the water over, which cost only 2,000 yuan including labor and materials. In order to expand the irrigation area and solve the problem of water retreat, the masses learned from the experience of other places and adopted the method of "long vines bearing melons, with ponds wrapping mu." From the beginning to the completion of the Dongliang Canal, the province or the prefecture was not asked for a technical cadre, a penny, or a catty of materials. The manpower, material resources, and financial resources needed were all solved by the masses themselves, and all difficulties were overcome by the masses themselves. The vast majority of water conservancy and soil and water conservation projects in the province were built in this way. The wisdom and strength of the masses are indeed inexhaustible. As long as they are brought into play, they can create earth-shattering achievements. This is the driving force for us to build socialism, build communism, transform society, and transform nature. We must cherish it very much, protect it with all our strength, and not damage it in the slightest. If we only look upward and not downward, only know how to reach out to the state for this and that, only know how to sigh in the face of difficulties, but do not mobilize the masses, do not rely on the masses, or even do not believe in the masses, point fingers from the sidelines, and pour cold water on the enthusiasm of the masses, the result will inevitably be a drag on our revolutionary cause. This is extremely wrong.

Building water conservancy projects, conserving water and soil, and changing the face of drought has always been the ideal of the people of all ethnic groups in Gansu for many years.

This beautiful and grand ideal can only be gradually turned into reality in the new era under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The masses of Dengjiabao said well, "We can turn poor mountains into rich mountains because the Communist Party and Chairman Mao lead well, the policy of cooperation is good, and the measures to change drought are good." They said, "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao came, and the people were liberated, and the land was also liberated." At the same time, although Gansu is poor and has a small population, the people have ambition, vigor, and drive. They can endure any hardship and overcome any difficulties. Our slogan is "Dare to imagine, work hard for ten years, cross the river (Bailong River) and cross the mountain (Qinling), and build a new countryside." Look at five years in ten years, look at three years in five years, look at the first year in three years, and look at the previous winter in the first year. The high tide since last winter has created an extremely good start. As long as we follow the teachings of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in the future, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, eliminate officialdom, eliminate old age, muster up our energy, strive for the top, rely on the masses, work hard to study, and leap forward again, we will surely be able to achieve our goals victoriously.

    兴修水利　保持水土　改变干旱面貌
    甘肃争取三年内基本实现水利化
    甘肃的兴修水利、保持水土运动，最大的阻力是来自人们的右倾保守思想。甘肃水利和水土保持事业的发展过程，也就是同右倾保守思想不断斗争的过程。首先要有思想上的大跃进，才能出现工作上的大跃进。而右倾保守思想只能拖住我们前进的脚步，钝化我们的斗争锋芒，挫折我们的意志，束缚我们的思想，如果不加以批判和克服，就会给我们的事业造成严重的损害。
    群众的智慧和力量是无穷无尽的，只要发挥出来，就能创造惊天动地的业绩。这是我们建设社会主义，建设共产主义，改造社会，改造自然的原动力，必须十分珍视，全力保护，不能有丝毫的损伤。如果眼睛只往上看，不往下看，只知道向国家伸手要这样要那样，只知道在困难面前唉声叹气，而不去发动群众，不去依靠群众，甚至不相信群众，在一旁指手划脚，给群众的积极性泼冷水，其结果必然对革命事业起促退作用。
    霍维德代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、簿一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告。
    从上次会议以来，我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下取得了一系列新的胜利。第一个五年计划已经完成和超额完成，第二个五年计划开始进入了第一个年头。特别是经过整风运动和反右派斗争，社会主义革命在政治战线和思想战线上获得了伟大胜利。人民群众的社会主义觉悟和劳动热情普遍高涨，在经济战线上首先是农业战线上正在掀起一个前所未有的新高潮，推动着各项建设事业以更大的规模和速度向前跃进。看到我们国家这样蒸蒸日上、欣欣向荣的新气象，我们真是感到无限的欢欣鼓舞，对于伟大的未来充满信心，充满希望。
    去冬今春遍地开花到处结果。群众有力出力，有钱出钱，有料出料，绝大多数工程所需人力物力财力，基本上都由群众自己想办法解决。一些成功的典型，如引水上山，得到普遍推广。
    我们甘肃，从去年冬季以来，随着全民性大辩论的胜利，在广大农村首先出现了一个热火朝天的兴修水利、保持水土运动。三百四十多万农民组成的大军，不顾严寒风霜，不分白昼黑夜，以雷霆万钧之势向自然展开了顽强的斗争。在短短三个月期间，一鼓作气修成了五百二十四万亩水地，正在兴修的还有二百多万亩。这个数字，比原定今年新修三百五十万亩水地的计划，加了一翻还多。每天平均修成五万多亩水地。水土保持完成了九千多平方公里，差不多等于今年计划的一半。现在运动正在蓬勃发展，只要不松劲，不冷场，再加一把力，今年全省新修一千万亩水地，完成两万平方公里以上的水土保持，是完全有把握的。
    甘肃去冬今春的兴修水利、保持水土运动，同一九五六年比较起来，是大大地跃进了一步。首先是规模更大，范围更广，人数更多，遍地开花，到处结果。其次是速度更快，质量更好，现灌更多；因为接受了一九五六年的经验教训，今年提高了工程质量，修一亩成一亩，修成以后就可以灌溉。第三，群众的智慧和力量发挥的更加充分，有力出力，有钱出钱，有料出料。已经投入水利和水土保持的达两亿个劳动日。群众在这方面的集资达两千多万元。绝大多数工程所需的人力、物力、财力，基本上都由群众自己想办法解决，即使一些比较大的工程也是这样；同时，群众的发明创造也更加丰富，改进工具，改进技术，克服了许多困难。更重要的，是一些成功的典型得到了普遍的推广。特别是武山县的东梁渠首创了引水上山以后，大大地鼓舞了山区群众发展水利的信心。在几个月内，许多地方掀起了水利上山的热潮。群众说，“山再高，高不过我们的脚跟；地再冻，冻不着我们火热的心”。天水和平凉两个专区的群众就修了五十三条“东梁渠”，可以浇地三百二十二万亩。工程最大的北梁渠，全长一百公里，海拔平均在一千六百公尺以上，跨武山、甘谷两县，参加施工的达三万人，修成以后可以浇地四十万亩左右。这样大规模的水利上山，给今后甘肃地区水利事业的发展打开了新的局面。在水土保持方面，武山县邓家堡的经验，已经被许多地方采用。现在全省已经有一千一百三十八个邓家堡，今年准备开展一个“一万个邓家堡”运动。
    冲破原来的计划，指向了更高的指标。新规划实现，甘肃的自然面貌和生产面貌就起了巨大的变化。
    去冬今春的兴修水利、保持水土高潮，冲破了我们原来制订的计划，指向了新的高峰。根据这个新的情况，结合各地经过群众讨论的意见，我们甘肃计划在三年之内，达到以下几个主要指标。这些指标和基数，都不包括就要划归宁夏回族自治区的地区在内。
    三年兴修水地二千五百万亩。加上原有的水地一千二百二十三万亩，到一九六○年全省可以有三千七百二十三万亩水地，占现有耕地六千万亩的百分之六十左右，每人平均有三亩五分以上的水地。
    三年保持水土七万平方公里。加上原有的保持水土面积三万平方公里，到一九六○年，水土保持面积将达到十万平方公里，等于原来全省水土流失面积的一半。
    三年造林三千万亩，种草三千万亩。加上现有的复盖面积六千二百七十七万亩，到一九六○年，全省可以有复盖面积一亿二千多万亩，占总面积六亿九千万亩的百分之十八。这里所说的种草，主要是种草木樨。这是一种多年生草，耐旱，容易生长，既可作饲草，又可作燃料和绿肥，的确是不可多得的宝草。
    农业方面的跃进，必然会带动其他各项事业首先是地方工业、文化教育和卫生事业的跃进。我们计划在三年之内，地方工业的产值从一九五七年的一亿五千万元，增加到十二亿元至十四亿元，也就是增长八倍到九倍。小学在校学生占学龄儿童的比例，从一九五七年的百分之五十增加到百分之九十二。基本上消灭老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子、臭虫、虱子、白蛉子等“七害”。
    如果我们在三年内实现了这些指标，到一九六○年，全省就可以基本上实现水利化，境内黄河流域和长江流域的水土流失地区，有一半可以得到控制；实现绿化也有了良好的基础；长期以来的干旱威胁基本上可以解除。地方工业的落后状态将大为改变。小学普及教育可以实现，社社有学校，人人讲卫生。预计到一九六二年，全省粮食产量可以达到二百亿斤左右，比一九五七年的八十五亿斤增加一倍多，每亩平均产量达到三百斤以上，比一九五七年增加约一百二十五斤；棉花产量达到二百四十万担，比一九五七年增加十三倍以上，每亩平均产量达到八十斤，比一九五七年增加约三十三斤。同时，地方工业的产值也将超过农业产值，比一九五七年增长十六倍到十九倍。这样，甘肃的自然面貌和生产面貌就起了巨大的变化，我们就完全有把握提前实现全国农业发展纲要了。
    甘肃的兴修水利、保持水土运动，从开始到现在，并不是没有遇到障碍的。客观上的困难固然很多，但是，最大的阻力却是来自人们的右倾保守思想。甘肃水利和水土保持事业的发展过程，也就是同右倾保守思想不断斗争的过程。一九五五年冬到一九五六年春，由于批判了右倾保守思想和“甘肃落后”论，在几个月内就修了六百三十四万亩水地，超过了解放前几千年所修水地的总和。可是，从一九五六年下半年起，右倾保守的歪风又刮起来了。一九五七年提出新修水地三百万亩，任务分不下去；减到二百五十万亩，分不下去；减到二百万亩，也分不下去；减到一百五十万亩，还是分不下去；一直减到一百一十二万亩，最后定为一百三十五万亩。而到九月底只完了一百零二万亩。经过这次整风运动，更加有力地批判了右倾保守思想，劲头又鼓起来了，而且比过去更大。三个月的时间，不但完成了一九五七年的尾数，而且新修了五百多万亩水地。从这里可以看出，首先要有思想上的大跃进，才能出现工作上的大跃进。而右倾保守思想只能拖住我们前进的脚步，钝化我们斗争的锋芒，挫折我们的意志，束缚我们的思想，如果不加以批判和克服，就会给我们的事业造成严重的损害。这是我们所必须经常警惕的。
    兴修水利、保持水土，实际上是一场人对自然的严重斗争，就是要发挥人的能动性去同自然争夺主动权，以便利用自然的力量来为人们谋福利。在这样一场斗争中，首先要有必胜的信心和革命的干劲，才能藐视和克服一切困难，取得必胜的结果。相反的，如果对改造自然缺乏信心，总想等待自然的恩赐，没有勇气去向自然搏斗，这就不可避免地使自己处于被动的地位，处处受到自然的摆弄。我们的定西专区，是一片最干旱的地区。几年来，由于开展了水利和水土保持工作，利用了雨水、地面水和地下水，到一九五七年，全区水地已经从解放前的三十六万多亩增加到一百六十一万多亩，每亩粮食产量从解放前的七十五斤提高到一百三十六斤。但是，自然条件比定西专区好得多的平凉专区，却是缺乏这种劲头，水利和水土保持工作远远落在后面。在一九五二年的时候，平凉专区的粮食亩产比定西专区高十三点三斤，到了一九五七年，反而比定西专区低五点六斤了。再拿张掖专区和银川专区来看，都是大型水利灌溉区，自然条件差不多，一九五七年张掖专区扩大了灌溉面积，增产了粮食，张掖县的小麦平均亩产超过了四百斤，敦煌县的棉花平均亩产达到一百零三斤，都提前实现了全国农业发展纲要所规定的一九六七年指标。可是，银川专区在这一年却荒废了十四万亩水地和十八万亩旱地，严重地影响了农业增产。可见事在人为，一切成绩都是人干出来的。只有干，才能从自然手里夺得更多的东西，才能增长知识和才干，才能逐步摸到自然的规律，也才能战胜一切困难。缺乏了这种信心，缺乏了这种干劲，在自然面前永远是无能为力的。
    如果不充分发挥千百万群众的智慧和集体力量，胜利就没有保证。武山县建设引水上山的东梁渠，没有向上级要过一个技术干部，要过一个钱，要过一斤材料，所需人力、物力、财力，都是群众自己解决的，一切困难也是群众自己克服的。全省绝大多数的水利和水土保持工程都是这样搞起来的。
    在兴修水利、保持水土、改造自然的斗争中，如果不充分发挥千百万群众的集体智慧和集体力量，胜利是没有保证的。武山县在这方面能够得到这样突出的成就，基本经验就是走群众路线，遇到困难同群众商量，向群众请教。在修东梁渠的时候，有些水利技术人员认为这样艰巨的工程，没有精确的地形测量，没有重点地质钻探资料，没有完整的比较设计，没有周密的施工组织，没有大量的投资和充裕的时间，是很难完成的。有的认为即使具备了这些条件，能不能在山上把水控制住，也还大成问题。当时还有人说，“若要水上山，除非辘轳长蔓马长角，乌鸦长出红耳朵。”但是，在群众面前，一切困难都被克服了。选线的时候，没有技术人员和测量仪器，只是由一位农民出身的水利科副科长带了一架简单的水平仪，组织了几位有经验的农民，用两天时间就把路线选定了。从选线到施工，只有五天时间。砌大坝入口，修涵洞、跌水，没有洋灰，群众就用草皮铺衬石头，干砌块石来代替。渠道要跨过一道四十二公尺宽、二十二公尺深的山沟，几位老木工想出用木头搭起架子，上面修一个渡槽，就把水渡过去了，连工带料只花了二千元。为了扩大灌溉面积和解决退水的问题，群众就学习别的地方的经验，采取了“长蔓结瓜、以塘包亩”的办法。东梁渠从开始到完工，没有向省上或专区要过一个技术干部，要过一个钱，要过一斤材料。所需的人力、物力和财力，都是群众自己解决的，一切困难也是群众自己克服的。全省绝大多数的水利和水土保持工程都是这样搞起来的。群众的智慧和力量的确是无穷无尽的，只要发挥出来，就能创造惊天动地的业迹。这是我们建设社会主义，建设共产主义，改造社会，改造自然的原动力，必须十分珍视，全力保护，不能有丝毫的损伤。如果眼睛只往上看，不往下看，只知道向国家伸手要这样要那样，只知道在困难面前唉声叹气，而不去发动群众，不去依靠群众，甚至不相信群众，在一旁指手划脚，给群众的积极性泼冷水，其结果必然对我们的革命事业起促退作用。这是极其错误的。
    兴修水利，保持水土，改变干旱面貌，多少年来一直就是甘肃各族人民梦寐以求的理想。
    这个美好的远大的理想，只有在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的新时代里，才能逐步变为现实。邓家堡的群众说得好，“我们能把穷山变富山，是共产党和毛主席领导好，合作化的政策好，改变干旱的措施好。”他们说，“共产党和毛主席来了，人翻身了，地也翻身了。”同时，甘肃虽穷，人口也不多，人民却有志气，有朝气，有干劲，能够忍受任何艰苦，战胜任何困难。我们的口号是“大胆设想，苦战十年，过江（白龙江）越岭（秦岭），建设新农村”。十年看五年，五年看三年，三年看头年，头年看前冬。去年冬季以来的高潮，已经创造了一个极其良好的开端。只要我们今后遵循中国共产党和毛主席的教导，发扬不断革命的精神，打掉官气，肃清暮气，鼓足干劲，力争上游，依靠群众，刻苦钻研，跃进再跃进，我们一定能够胜利地达到我们的目的。
