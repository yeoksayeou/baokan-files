Xinhua News Agency, 6th: State Council Instructions on Strengthening the Management and Education of Demobilized Soldiers

The Chinese People's Liberation Army has demobilized and transferred 6 million personnel to local areas to engage in industrial and agricultural production. At present, the vast majority of demobilized soldiers have been properly settled, and their work and lives are guaranteed. After demobilization and transfer, the vast majority of these demobilized soldiers can maintain the excellent traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and actively participate in various socialist construction projects. They have demonstrated a positive role on the national construction and production front; in organizing the militia and maintaining local public security, and in the struggle against illegal landlords, rich peasant elements, counter-revolutionaries, and other bad elements, they have shown a firm stance and become backbone elements. However, there are also a very small number of backward elements and bad elements who are arrogant, unwilling to settle down to production, disobedient to leadership, and even violate laws and discipline, and make unreasonable demands, etc. These lawbreakers must be treated seriously and handled appropriately.

In order to mobilize the positive factors of demobilized and transferred soldiers, give full play to their positive role in socialist construction, and prevent possible negative phenomena, the following instructions are given:

(1) Strengthen the management and education of demobilized and transferred soldiers. In addition to the relevant government departments being responsible for this work, military departments at all levels, especially provincial military districts, military sub-districts, and county and city conscription bureaus, must assist local governments and relevant parties to jointly assume responsibility, and regularly educate demobilized soldiers to maintain their honor, abide by policies and laws, obey leadership, and actively work, and serve as models for the people.

(2) For some demobilized soldiers who have not yet been settled, people's committees at all levels should promptly and properly settle them, so that they can be assigned to suitable positions. The main thing should be to arrange for them to participate in agricultural production.

(3) Demobilized soldiers who violate laws and discipline should be given warnings; those whose circumstances are serious and who repeatedly fail to correct their behavior after warnings should have their demobilized soldier status revoked, and be supervised by the township or commune to engage in labor production. Demobilized soldiers who have committed crimes should be punished according to the law.

(4) When handling demobilization work, the army should strengthen ideological and legal education for demobilized soldiers, and encourage them to actively engage in labor production after returning to their hometowns. For certain elements who have behaved poorly in the army and have repeatedly refused to mend their ways after education, they should be expelled from the military before demobilization, and the people's committee of their place of origin should be notified to implement controlled production, and they should not enjoy the honor and treatment of demobilized soldiers.

　　充分发挥积极因素　防止可能发生的消极作用
    国务院指示加强复员军人管理教育
    新华社6日讯　国务院关于加强对复员军人管理教育的指示
    中国人民解放军先后复员转业到地方从事工农业生产的人员已达六百万人。目前绝大多数的复员军人都已经得到安置，工作和生活有了保障。这批复员军人在复员转业之后，绝大多数都能保持中国人民解放军的优良传统，积极参加各项社会主义建设。在国家建设和生产战线上，表现了积极作用；在组织民兵和维护地方治安，在向不法地主、富农分子、反革命分子以及其他坏分子斗争中，表现了立场坚定，并成为骨干分子。但是，也有极少数的落后分子和坏分子，他们居功骄傲，不安心生产，不服从领导，甚至违法乱纪，无理取闹等等。对于这些违法人员必须予以严肃对待和适当处理。
    为了调动复员转业军人的积极因素，充分发挥他们在社会主义建设中的积极作用，防止可能发生的消极现象，现作如下指示：
    （一）加强对复员转业军人的管理教育。这项工作除由政府有关部门负责外，各级军事部门特别是省军区、军分区和县、市兵役局，必须协助当地政府和有关方面，共同负起责任，经常教育复员军人保持荣誉，遵守政策法令，服从领导，积极劳动，要作人民群众的模范。
    （二）对于某些尚未安置的复员军人，各级人民委员会应当从速妥善安置，使之各得其所，主要的应该是安置他们参加农业生产。
    （三）对于违法乱纪的复员军人，应当给予告诫；其中情节严重和屡诫不改的分子，应当取消其复员军人资格，由乡或社监督劳动生产。对于犯有罪行的复员军人，应当依法惩处。
    （四）军队在办理复员工作的时候，应当加强对复员军人的思想教育和法制教育，鼓励他们回乡后积极劳动生产。对于某些在部队中就表现恶劣屡教不改的分子，在复员前应当开除军籍，并通知所在地方的人民委员会施行管制生产，不得享受复员军人的荣誉和待遇。
                            国务院总理　周恩来
                              一九五八年二月六日
