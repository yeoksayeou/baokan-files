Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Without revolutionary fervor, it is impossible to launch a movement against waste and conservatism. In recent days, a massive revolutionary competition against waste and conservatism has taken shape within the central state organs. Many units have proposed using this movement to compete in advancement, compete in drive, and test whether leaders have the determination to eliminate bureaucratic airs and lethargy that hinder the development of the movement.

After Days of High Tide of Speaking Out, Backward Units Became Advanced Units

According to statistics from fifteen ministries including the Ministry of Coal, the Ministry of Geology, and the Ministry of Commerce, the number of dazibao (big character posters) in these organs has surged from more than 80,000 on the 15th to more than 240,000 on the 24th. Various forms of waste and conservative ideas in each unit are being besieged by the masses.

This wave of competition promoting the in-depth and broad development of the anti-waste and anti-conservative movement was formed after the Central State Organs Party Committee convened a promotion meeting on the 15th. After this meeting, the vast majority of central state organs examined right-leaning conservative ideas, learned from the experiences of advanced units such as the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and a revolutionary competition of comparing dazibao, comparing depth, and comparing drive rapidly emerged among the masses. Many units checked accounts, checked archives, and checked order cards. Some worked on holidays without rest, and some stayed up all night writing dazibao. Thus, a high tide of speaking out was set off in a few days.

The Ministry of Coal Industry, which had once slackened, posted only more than 7,100 dazibao from February 6th to 16th. After examining the shortcomings of the previous stage of the movement and proposing to learn from advanced units, it has now posted more than 35,000 dazibao, and the quality is relatively high. Some staff members of the Ministry of Food wrote more than 5,000 dazibao during the Spring Festival holiday. They proposed the slogan: "Farmers achieve 458, we dig deeper, search every corner, determined to oppose waste." By the 24th, the Ministry of Food had posted an average of more than 24 dazibao per person, including Weng Jie and three others in the Finance and Accounting Department who posted more than 260 dazibao each. Now this ministry has leapt from a state of slow progress to become an advanced unit.

Dazibao Exposed Major Problems and Major Waste, Shocking Those with Conservative Ideas

In the revolutionary competition against waste and conservatism, not only did the number of dazibao increase, but the quality also continued to improve. Many major problems related to principles and policies that had not been touched upon before, and the resulting major waste, were exposed one by one. This shocked those who originally had conservative ideas. The Sales Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building posted more than 400 dazibao from the 12th to the 14th. The leaders of the bureau believed that the speaking out was "almost enough" and therefore relaxed their leadership, causing the movement to stagnate. Later, after the ministry mobilized them, the bureau leaders examined their conservative ideas and re-mobilized the masses to carry out a comparison and competition to learn from and catch up with advanced units. On the 24th, the entire bureau posted more than 800 dazibao in one day. One dazibao titled "Emergency Rescue of 560,000 Yuan of Capital Construction Costs" demanded that the leaders quickly notify the local offices to temporarily stop building warehouses, because after the merger of the First Ministry of Machine Building with the Ministry of Electrical Machinery and the Second Ministry of Machine Building, the originally insufficient warehouses could be adjusted and used mutually. After research, the bureau leaders have ordered the Beijing office to stop building warehouses and are studying the suspension of warehouse construction in other regions. Another dazibao exposed the bureaucratic phenomenon in the Sales Bureau's grasp of needs. This dazibao said that last year, because the relevant personnel did not understand the social needs well and had conservative ideas, the production of metal cutting machine tools was reduced by several thousand units. The machine tools produced throughout the year were sold out by the end of last year, and the supply of machine tools felt very tight at the beginning of this year. Through this example, this dazibao pointed out a major problem in the work of the Sales Bureau, namely how to overcome bureaucracy and conservative ideas and understand social needs. Many similar major problems can also be seen in the newly posted dazibao of many other departments. These are things that people did not expect beforehand.

Observation and Evaluation, Challenges and Responses, Guiding the Movement to a New Peak

In this surging revolutionary competition against waste and conservatism, the activities of mutual observation and mutual evaluation among the organs are very frequent. The central finance and trade units held an on-site meeting at the Livestock Products Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. After visiting the dazibao on-site and listening to the introduction of the Livestock Products Company's experience, a competition upsurge of "learning from livestock products, catching up with livestock products, and surpassing livestock products" was set off. Evaluation competition tables for ministries or departments were generally established, and the numbers of waste exposed by each unit and individual were announced every day. This evaluation table commended the advanced units and individuals who collected materials from all directions to besiege waste, and also criticized those leading cadres or staff members who were indifferent to the movement and were tired and slack. On the evaluation table announced by the Basic Construction Bureau of the Urban Service Department on the 14th, both bureau chiefs were blank, and not a single dazibao was written. After the announcement, the two bureau chiefs quickly wrote dazibao and exposed a lot of waste. Several cadres in this department have always rarely spoken in previous movements and this rectification movement, and did not write a single dazibao at the beginning of this movement. After evaluation and the help of leading cadres, they have now written more than a dozen dazibao. Some departments have also launched challenges and responses comparing drive, the number of dazibao, and quality between various units. The Wool Spinning Section of the Wool, Flax, and Silk Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry issued a letter of challenge to other sections of the entire bureau. They proposed that each person should produce an average of fifteen dazibao. In addition to exposing waste facts, these dazibao should also be combined with business principles and the implementation of the first five-year plan for inspection, while strengthening political and ideological criticism; eliminate concerns, and draw fire to themselves. Their challenge conditions were immediately responded to by the Infrastructure Section and the Flax Spinning Section, and these two sections responded with an average of twenty dazibao per person as challenge conditions. A section chief of the Labor and Wage Department of this ministry also challenged the director by name, wanting to compare the number of dazibao and the courage to criticize his immediate boss. These evaluations and challenges and responses guided the revolutionary drive of the masses against waste and conservatism to a new peak.

The Leadership's Timely Criticism of Conservative Ideas Promoted the Rapid Formation of a Climax in the Movement

In the movement, leading cadres' timely examination and criticism of right-leaning conservative ideas, overcoming the lethargy of insufficient drive, and determination to draw fire to themselves are important factors in the rapid formation of a climax in the anti-waste and anti-conservative movement. The director of the Labor and Wage Department of the Ministry of Construction Engineering went deep into various places to inspect all day, and worked overtime with the masses every night to write dazibao. This department has a total of 38 people, and posted more than 210 dazibao in one day on the 17th. The leading cadres of the Poultry and Egg Bureau of the Urban Service Department not only took the lead in writing dazibao, but also, based on their experience of visiting the Livestock Products Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, proposed many methods to promote the development of the movement. For example, they proposed that exposing waste requires doing three things (think about business trips, think about work, think about life, expose waste from these three aspects), three checks (check notes, check official documents and summaries, check archives), and three actions (Party and League mobilization, bureau and department chiefs leading, everyone taking the initiative) and other action slogans, which greatly increased the enthusiasm of the masses, and the number of dazibao rose rapidly, making this bureau the most advanced unit in the entire department. The leading cadres of some units also held various promotion meetings to promote the development of the movement in the right direction. The Ministry of Commerce held five promotion meetings of various forms one after another around the Spring Festival, which promoted the rapid development of the movement. There was a woolen mill in the Ministry of Textile Industry that had waste in the process of preparation for construction, but in the past, from the factory director to the staff of the preparatory office did not admit this fact. This time, the person in charge of the Wool, Flax, and Silk Bureau held a meeting with them to explain the policy and dispel their concerns, so that they faced up to this waste phenomenon. Afterwards, the staff immediately posted more than 40 dazibao to expose the waste phenomenon, and proposed measures that could prevent tens of thousands of yuan of investment from being wasted.

The revolutionary competition of the anti-waste and anti-conservative movement launched by the central state organs will play a significant role in ensuring the complete victory of the rectification movement. However, there are still some organs that have not been involved in the competition. They hold the idea of "following the crowd," not lagging behind, nor being advanced. Some leading cadres of these organs have not yet freed themselves from lethargy. If they do not change this situation, they may miss a favorable opportunity, and the great leap forward in work will become empty talk.

### 中央国家机关掀起革命大竞赛  浪费现象和保守思想四面楚歌  群众提出：农民四五八，我们向深挖，翻箱又倒柜，决心反浪费

    中央国家机关掀起革命大竞赛
    浪费现象和保守思想四面楚歌
    群众提出：农民四五八，我们向深挖，翻箱又倒柜，决心反浪费
    新华社26日讯　没有革命的干劲就无法开展起反浪费反保守运动。这几天以来，在中央国家机关内形成了声势浩大的反浪费反保守的革命竞赛，许多单位都提出要通过这个运动来比先进，比干劲，并且检验领导者是否有决心打掉阻碍运动发展的官风和暮气。
    几天之中掀起鸣放高潮后进单位成了先进单位
    据煤炭部、地质部、商业部等十五个部的统计，这些机关的大字报已经由15日的八万多张激增到24日的二十四万多张。各单位形形色色的浪费现象和保守思想，正陷于群众性的围剿之中。
    这个促进反浪费反保守运动向深广发展的竞赛浪潮，是在中央国家机关党委15日召开促进会议以后形成的。这次会议以后，绝大多数中央国家机关都检查了右倾保守思想，学习了冶金工业部、对外贸易部等先进单位的经验，在群众中迅速出现了比大字报、比深透、比干劲的革命竞赛。许多单位查账目、查档案、查订货卡片，有的在假日不休息，有的通宵赶写大字报，这样在几天之中就掀起了鸣放热潮。
    曾经一度松劲的煤炭工业部，从2月6日到16日只贴出大字报七千一百多张，经过检查前一阶段运动的缺点和提出向先进单位看齐以后，现在已经贴出三万五千多张大字报，而且质量比较高。粮食部有的工作人员在春节假期内，赶写了五千多张大字报，他们提出口号说：“农民四五八，我们向深挖，翻箱又倒柜，决心反浪费”。到24日止，粮食部平均每人贴出了二十四张多大字报，其中财会司翁杰等四人每人都贴了二百六十多张。现在这个部已由原来进展迟缓的状态一跃而成为先进的单位。
    大字报揭发了大问题和大浪费使有保守思想的人大吃一惊
    在反浪费反保守的革命竞赛中，不仅大字报数目增多，而且质量也不断提高，原来没有触及到的许多有关方针政策上的大问题和所形成的大浪费，一个个被揭露出来。这就使原来具有保守思想的人大吃一惊。第一机械工业部销售局从12日到14日贴出大字报四百多张，局领导方面就认为鸣放“差不多”了，因而放松了领导，使运动陷于停滞状态。以后经过部里动员，局领导检查了保守思想，重新发动群众开展学先进赶先进的评比竞赛，在24日一天全局就贴出大字报八百多张，其中有一张题为“要紧急抢救五十六万元基建费用”的大字报，要求领导上赶快通知各地办事处暂时停止建设仓库，因为第一机械部同电机部、第二机械部合并，原来不足用的仓库，可以互相调剂使用。局领导方面经过研究，已下令北京办事处停建仓库，并且正在研究停建其他地区的仓库。另一张大字报揭露了销售局在掌握需要方面存在的官僚主义现象。这张大字报说，去年因为有关人员没有很好摸清社会需要情况，存在着保守思想，结果使去年金属切削机床少生产了几千台，全年生产的机床在去年年底就售卖一空，今年年初机床供应感到十分紧张。这张大字报通过这个事例，一针见血地指出了销售局工作中的一个大问题，即是如何克服官僚主义和保守思想，摸清社会需要的问题。像这类大问题，在其它许多部门新贴出的大字报上，也可以看到许多。这是一些人事先所没有想到的。
    观摩评比　挑战应战  引导运动走上新的高峰
    在这个汹涌澎湃的反浪费反保守的革命竞赛中，各机关互相观摩、互相评比的活动十分频繁。中央各财贸单位在外贸部畜产公司举行现场会议，实地参观大字报和听取畜产公司的经验介绍后，掀起了“学习畜产、赶上畜产、超过畜产”的竞赛热潮，普遍建立了部或司局的评比竞赛表，每天公布各单位和个人揭发浪费的数字。这种评比表，表扬了那些从四面八方搜集材料围攻浪费的先进单位和个人，也批评了那些对运动漠不关心、疲沓松劲的领导干部或工作人员。城市服务部基本建设局14日公布的评比表上，两位局长都是空白，一篇大字报也没有写；公布后，这两位局长连忙写大字报，揭发了不少浪费现象。这个部有几个干部在过去历次运动和这次整风运动中一向很少发言，这次运动初期一张大字报也没有写，经过评比和领导干部的帮助，现在都写了十多张大字报。有些部门各单位之间还展开了比干劲、比大字报数量及质量的挑战和应战。纺织工业部毛麻丝局毛纺科向全局其他科提出了挑战书，他们提出，要求每人平均出十五张大字报，这些大字报除揭发浪费事实，还要结合业务方针及第一个五年计划执行情况进行检查，同时加强政治思想批判；消除顾虑，引火烧身。他们的挑战条件立即得到基建科和麻纺科的响应，这两个科并且以每人平均出二十张大字报作为应战条件。这个部的劳动工资司的一个科长也指名向司长挑战，要和他比大字报的张数和批评顶头上司的勇气。这些评比和挑应战把群众反浪费反保守的革命干劲引导到新的高峰。
    领导上及时批判保守思想促使运动迅速形成高潮
    在运动中，领导干部及时检查和批判右倾保守思想，克服干劲不足的暮气，决心引火烧身，是反浪费反保守运动迅速形成高潮的重要因素。建筑工程部劳动工资司司长整天深入各处检查，每晚同群众一起加班赶写大字报，这个司共三十八人，在17日一天就贴出大字报二百一十多张。城市服务部禽蛋局的领导干部不仅自己带头写大字报，而且根据他们参观对外贸易部畜产公司的经验，提出了许多推动运动开展的办法，如他们提出揭发浪费需要做到三想（想出差、想工作、想生活，从这三方面揭发浪费现象），三查（查笔记、查文电总结、查档案），三动（党团发动、局处长带动、人人主动）等行动口号，群众积极性大大提高，大字报数量迅速上升，使这个局成为全部最先进的单位。有些单位的领导干部还召开各种促进会，推动运动向正确的方向开展。商业部在春节前后接连召开五次各种形式的促进会，推动了运动迅速发展。纺织工业部有一个毛纺厂在筹建过程中有浪费，但是过去从厂长到筹备处的工作人员都不承认这个事实，这次毛麻丝局的负责人和他们一起开会解释政策，打消他们的顾虑，使他们正视这种浪费现象，以后，工作人员马上贴出四十几张大字报揭发了浪费现象，并提出目前还可以使几十万元的投资不致浪费的措施。
    中央国家机关掀起反浪费反保守运动的革命竞赛，对于保证整风运动获得全胜，势将起着重大的作用。但是，目前还有一些机关没有卷入到竞赛中来，他们抱着“随大流”的思想，不落后，也不当先进，这些机关的一些领导干部还没有从暮气中解脱出来，不改变这种状况，他们就有可能坐失有利时机，而使工作大跃进成为空谈。
