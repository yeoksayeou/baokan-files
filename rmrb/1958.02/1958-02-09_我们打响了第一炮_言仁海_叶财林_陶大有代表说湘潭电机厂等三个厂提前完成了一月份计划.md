We Fired the First Shot
	Yan Renhai, Ye Cailin, and Tao Dayou, representatives, said that Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory and two other factories had completed their January plans ahead of schedule.

	At this People's Congress, we listened to and discussed the reports of Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and we fully agree with these reports.

	We are confident in realizing this call - Steel production will catch up with the UK in fifteen years
	We are from the industrial production front in Hunan. The Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory, Changsha Machine Tool Factory, and Xiangjiang Machinery Factory where we work are factories that provide important equipment such as motors and machine tools for the country's industrial construction. Currently, in these three factories of ours, a surging new upsurge of socialist competition has been set off for the great leap forward in industrial production.

	In Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report, it was said that politics is the commander and soul of economic work and all other work. Practice has proved that this is indeed an irrefutable truth. Since the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle last year, the three bad styles of leadership cadres in our factories have been overcome, the relationship between leaders and the masses has become closer, the socialist consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses have been improved, and production is advancing by leaps and bounds.

	The measures of leading cadres participating in physical labor and cadres being sent to lower levels have had a profound and positive impact on the working masses. At the end of last year, Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory needed to dismantle a temporary material warehouse due to the installation of pipelines. At that time, there were dozens of tons of angle iron piled up in this warehouse. According to the previous method, temporary workers would have been hired to move it away. This time, the factory director and members of the Party committee took the lead in moving the angle iron, and many cadres participated. As a result, not only was the angle iron moved out, but also the environmental sanitation of the site was cleaned up. The worker comrades were very moved when they saw it. After the policy of streamlining institutions and sending cadres to lower levels was implemented, Xiangjiang Machinery Factory sent more than 900 cadres to labor positions. The cold working workshop of Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory originally had 49 full-time cadres, and they often complained that they were too busy. Now, after mobilizing the masses for discussion, it has been initially streamlined to 26 people, and not only can the work be done very well, but also many comrades are reflecting that they still have potential. After seeing these wise and firm measures of our Party, the worker masses generally reflected, "The Communist Party is truly great, they do what they say." Many young apprentices who were originally not at ease with their work and unwilling to do physical labor have become at ease with their work under the education of these vivid facts. In our factories, because cadres go deep into the lower levels and often participate in labor with the masses, production problems can be discovered in a timely manner, and many key problems that have not been solved for a long time have been quickly resolved.

	When we were greeting the second five-year plan with full political enthusiasm, the Party Central Committee put forward the great call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer. This call has greatly encouraged us. We all have the confidence to realize this great call of the Party.

	Our slogan is to fire the first shot - The January plan has been completed ahead of schedule
	"In order to catch up with Britain, we must fire the first shot!" This is the resounding slogan shouted by our factory when it began to implement the country's second five-year plan. On the first working day of 1958, many workers in Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory completed the work quota of 20 hours within 8 hours of working time. Before January 20, a group of advanced teams reported good news to the factory - they had completed the January production plan ahead of schedule. The plan put forward by the cold working workshop to create "four-no teams" (no defective products, no accidents, no late arrivals or absenteeism, no lost tools) has been widely responded to by the worker comrades. The forging workshop of Changsha Machine Tool Factory completely eliminated defective products in December last year. Currently, the entire factory is carrying out a no-defective product competition. At the same time, on the basis of existing equipment, it is striving to increase production by 85 machine tools throughout the year. The January monthly production plan has been fully completed five days ahead of schedule. The broad masses of workers and staff of Xiangjiang Machinery Factory are actively studying the technology for manufacturing new products, and many advanced teams have overfulfilled their production plans.

	In order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production, our three factories have already taken action. In the first half of January, the workers and staff of Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory used their spare time to accumulate more than 6,300 dan of fertilizer and gave it to the agricultural cooperatives near the factory free of charge. Changsha Machine Tool Factory plans to support 16,000 work hours this year to repair and manufacture agricultural tools for agricultural cooperatives. In addition, during the spring plowing season, it has also decided to support 500 laborers for the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative near the factory. Xiangjiang Machinery Factory has already sent a batch of agricultural tools made by the workers themselves and donated books to the farmers.

	Using industrial city sewage to irrigate fields - Great benefits for increasing agricultural production
	In the work of supporting the great leap forward in agriculture, we want to focus on talking about the issue of using domestic sewage from industrial and mining areas or industrial cities to irrigate farmland. The method of using domestic sewage to irrigate farmland was created by the factories in Zhuzhou City, where Xiangjiang Machinery Factory is located. In 1956, in order to help agricultural cooperatives fight drought, the factory first introduced sewage to irrigate 200 mu of farmland. In 1957, in order to fight drought, sewage was used again to help agricultural cooperatives irrigate 400 mu of farmland. As a result, the rice fields irrigated with sewage produced 200 jin of rice per mu more than the rice fields not irrigated with sewage. At the same time, the factory saved 80,000 jin of bleaching powder for treating sewage. The Zhuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has summarized and promoted this experience, and decided to expand the area of using sewage to irrigate farmland to 7,000 mu this year.

	In the past, urban sewage has always been considered toxic and treated before being discharged into rivers. After the successful attempt of using sewage to irrigate farmland in Zhuzhou City, the Zhuzhou Municipal Committee organized scientific and technical personnel, with the help of Soviet experts, to analyze and study the sewage in Zhuzhou City. As a result, it was found that the sewage contains very high fertilizer components and that it does not harm crops. Currently, the method of using sewage to irrigate fields in Zhuzhou is: first let the sewage flow through the sewage pipes, concentrate in the reservoir, and then use water pumps to pump the sewage from the reservoir to a high place, and then flow into the farmland along the opened channels.

	We suggest that design departments, urban construction departments, and scientific research departments pay attention to this experience in Zhuzhou City and immediately conduct research and promotion. We believe that if this experience is promoted nationwide, the agricultural production near many industrial cities and industrial and mining areas with suitable conditions will greatly benefit.

　　我们打响了第一炮
    言仁海　叶财林　陶大有代表说湘潭电机厂等三个厂提前完成了一月份计划
    在这次人民代表大会上，我们听取并讨论了彭真副委员长、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理和吴玉章主任的报告，我们完全同意这些报告。
    我们有信心实现这一号召  十五年钢铁产量赶上英国
    我们是来自湖南工业生产战线。我们工作的湘潭电机厂、长沙机床厂和湘江机械厂，是给国家工业建设提供电机、工作母机等重要装备的工厂。目前，在我们这三个工厂里，已经为工业生产的大跃进掀起了一个汹涌澎湃的社会主义竞赛新高潮。
    在李先念副总理的报告中说，政治是经济工作和其它一切工作的统帅和灵魂。实践证明，这的确是一个颠扑不破的真理。自从经过去年的整风和反右派斗争以后，我们工厂的领导干部作风上的三个坏主义被克服了，领导与群众的关系密切了，群众的社会主义觉悟与积极性提高了，生产正在一日千里地前进。
    领导干部参加体力劳动和干部下放的措施，在工人群众中发生了极其深远的良好的影响。去年年底，湘潭电机厂因为安装管道，需要拆掉一个临时性的材料库房。当时在这个库房里堆有几十吨角铁。按过去办法便需要雇用临时工搬走。这次厂长和党委委员们亲自带头搬角铁，许多干部都参加。结果不仅把角铁搬空了，连现场的环境卫生也打扫了。工人同志们看了都很感动。在精简机构和干部下放方针执行以后，湘江机械厂下放九百多干部走上了劳动岗位。湘潭电机厂冷作车间原有脱产干部四十九人，还经常喊工作忙不过来。现在发动群众讨论后，初步精简到二十六人，不但工作能够做得很好，而且很多同志还在反映，他们还有潜力。工人群众看到我们党的这些英明而坚定的措施后，普遍地反映说：“共产党真伟大，说到做到。”许多原来不安心工作、不愿做体力劳动的青年徒工，在这些生动的事实教育下，工作安心了。在我们工厂里，由于干部深入下层，并经常与群众一起参加劳动，生产上的问题都能及时被发现，许多长期没有解决的关键问题，很快地得到了解决。
    当我们正在以饱满的政治热情迎接第二个五年计划的时候，党中央提出了要在十五年或稍多一点时间内，在钢铁和其它重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的伟大号召。这个号召使我们受到了很大的鼓舞。我们都有信心实现党的这一伟大号召。
    我们的口号是打响第一炮  一月份计划已经提前完成
    “为了赶上英国，一定要打响第一炮！”这是我们工厂开始执行国家第二个五年计划喊出来的响亮口号。在一九五八年的头一个劳动日里，湘潭电机厂有好多工人在八小时的工作时间内，完成了二十个小时的工作定额，元月二十日以前，就有一批先进班组向厂部报捷——提前完成了元月份的生产计划。冷作车间提出的创造“四无班组”（无废品、无事故、无迟到旷工、无遗失工具）的规划，已经得到了工人同志广泛的响应。长沙机床厂锻工车间，去年十二月份完全消灭了废品，目前全厂正在开展无废品竞赛，同时还在现有的设备基础上，争取全年增产八十五台机床，元月份已经提前五天全面完成了月生产计划。湘江机械厂广大职工群众正在积极钻研制造新产品的技术，许多先进班组都超额完成了生产计划。
    为了支援农业生产的大跃进，我们三个工厂已经行动起来了。湘潭电机厂职工在元月上半月就利用业余时间积肥六千三百多担，无偿地送给了工厂附近的农业社。长沙机床厂计划在今年支援一万六千个工时，为农业社修理与制造农具。此外，春耕期间，还决定支援工厂附近的红光农业社五百个劳动力。湘江机械厂已经把一批由工人亲手制造的农具和捐献的书籍，送给了农民。
    利用工业城市污水灌田  对农业增产大有好处
    在支援农业大跃进的工作上，我们想着重谈谈利用工矿区或工业城市生活污水灌溉农田的问题。利用生活污水灌溉农田的办法是湘江机械厂所在的株洲市的工厂创造的。一九五六年工厂为帮助农业社抗旱，曾经第一次引污水灌溉农田二百亩。一九五七年抗旱又引用污水帮助农业社灌溉农田四百亩。结果这些被污水灌溉过的稻田，比没有用污水灌溉的稻田每亩增产了二百斤稻谷。同时工厂方面还省下了处理污水的漂白粉八万斤。中共株洲市委已经总结推广了这个经验，并决定在今年把引用污水灌溉农田的面积扩大到七千亩。
    城市污水，在过去一直是被认为有毒而加以处理后放入江河的。株洲市利用污水灌溉农田的尝试成功后，株洲市委组织了科学技术人员在苏联专家的帮助下，对株洲市的污水进行过分析研究，结果发现污水中含有的肥料成分很高，而且它对农作物没有损害。目前，株洲引用污水灌田的办法是：先让污水流过污水管道，集中在蓄水池里，再用水泵将蓄水池里的污水打到高处，顺着开好的渠道灌入农田。
    我们建议：设计部门，城市建设部门，科学研究部门，重视株洲市的这一经验，立即进行研究推广。我们认为：这一经验如果在全国范围内加以推广，许多有条件的工业城市和工矿区附近的农业生产，将会得到很大的利益。
