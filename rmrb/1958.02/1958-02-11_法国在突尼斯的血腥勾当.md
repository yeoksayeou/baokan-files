France's Bloody Deeds in Tunisia
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    French colonialists have committed another bloody deed in North Africa. On February 8th, twenty-five French aircraft bombed the Tunisian village of Sakiet-Sidi-Youssef in shifts. In the bombing, two-thirds of the village was destroyed, and the death toll was approximately one hundred.
    Tunisia has declared its independence for nearly two years. However, during this period, France has rudely refused to respect Tunisia's sovereignty. Because the Tunisian people care for and support their brothers in Algeria in their struggle for independence, French colonialists have been clamoring since August of last year to use the so-called "right of pursuit" to threaten the Tunisian people with military attacks and have constantly carried out armed provocations against Tunisia. And this time, French colonialists blatantly launched a large-scale attack on Tunisia with a large number of aircraft.
    This barbaric act of aggression by the French colonialists has aroused extreme indignation among the Tunisian people. The Tunisian government has recalled its ambassador to France and decided to submit the issue to the United Nations Security Council. In order to demand the withdrawal of French troops, the Tunisian people have launched a broad struggle. It is clear that the French colonialists' attempt to intimidate the Tunisian people with massacres will never succeed.
    Arab countries have expressed a firm and united position on France's act of aggression. The Moroccan government has issued a statement expressing sympathy and support for Tunisia. The Algerian National Liberation Front has also issued a stern condemnation of France. France's situation in North Africa has become more difficult due to its act of aggression against Tunisia.
    It is worth noting the United States' reaction to this event. In a statement, Dulles, while expressing "concern" and "unease" about the French aircraft bombing of Tunisia, demanded that Tunisia adopt a "conciliatory" attitude towards the French aggressors. According to U.S. news agencies, officials in Washington believe that Tunisia is currently in a period of financial difficulty and needs the support of the West, so the United States can take advantage of the opportunity.
    However, the facts have opened the eyes of the Tunisian people. As pointed out by the head of the Algerian National Liberation Front, France's colonial war against Algeria and its aggression against Tunisia have received material, financial, and diplomatic support from the U.S. government. Therefore, the publication "Action" of Tunisia's ruling Neo-Destour party cannot but draw this conclusion: "...making us dependent on the West will only bring us frustration and humiliation, and sometimes something in between two 'charitable gestures' - bombs." In the face of the awakened North African people, the French colonialists who openly use force are certainly encountering increasingly strong opposition, and the U.S. neo-colonialism that appears in a hypocritical guise is bound to run into snags.

    法国在突尼斯的血腥勾当
    本报评论员
    法国殖民主义者在北非又干下了一件血腥勾当。2月8日，二十五架法国飞机轮番轰炸突尼斯的萨基埃特—西迪—优素福村。在轰炸中，这个村子的三分之二被毁掉了，死亡的人数约有一百人。
    突尼斯宣布独立已经将近两年了。但是，在这段时期中，法国一直粗暴地拒绝尊重突尼斯的主权。由于突尼斯人民关怀和支持他们在阿尔及利亚的兄弟争取独立的斗争，法国殖民主义者从去年8月开始，就叫嚣要使用所谓“追击权”，以军事进攻威胁突尼斯人民，并且不断对突尼斯进行武装挑衅。而这一次，法国殖民主义者又以大批飞机，公然对突尼斯发动了大规模的袭击。
    法国殖民主义者这种野蛮的侵略行为，引起了突尼斯人民的极度愤慨。突尼斯政府已经召回了它驻法国的大使，并且决定把这个问题提交联合国安全理事会。为了要求法国军队撤退，突尼斯人民已掀起了广泛的斗争。很显然，法国殖民主义者企图用屠杀来恫吓突尼斯人民，是决不会成功的。
    阿拉伯各国对法国的侵略行为表现了坚决一致立场。摩洛哥政府已经发表声明，对突尼斯表示同情和声援。阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线也对法国提出了严正的谴责。法国在北非的处境，由于它对突尼斯的侵略行为而更加困难了。
    值得注意的是美国对这个事件的反应，杜勒斯在他的一个声明中，虽然对法国飞机轰炸突尼斯的事件也表示了“关心”和“不安”，然而却要求突尼斯对法国侵略者采取“和解”的态度。据美国通讯社透露，华盛顿的官员认为，突尼斯目前正处在财政困难的时期，需要得到西方的支持，因此美国可以乘机而入。
    但是，事实已经擦亮了突尼斯人民的眼睛。正如阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线负责人所指出的，法国对阿尔及利亚的殖民战争也好，法国对突尼斯的侵略行动也好，都得到了美国政府在物质、财政和外交上的支持。因此，突尼斯执政的新宪政党的刊物“行动”不能不得出这样的结论：“……使我们依附西方，只会给我们带来挫折和屈辱，有时是介于两种‘慈善姿态’之间的东西——炸弹。”在觉醒了的北非人民面前，明火执仗的法国殖民主义者固然遭到了日益强烈的反对，以伪善姿态出现的美国新殖民主义肯定也是要碰壁的。
