	78,000 New Apartments
	This year, Moscow residents will receive 78,000 new apartments with a total area of 2.33 million square meters. In addition to housing, the city of Moscow will also build dozens of hospitals and schools.
	Moscow has allocated 4.5 billion rubles this year for housing and cultural welfare facilities.

	The Soviet Union's Largest Puppet Theater
	The Soviet Puppet Theater, led by Sergei Obraztsov, which is very popular with the masses, recently obtained a new five-story theater in the center of Moscow. The theater has been decided to be named the Puppet Palace, and it is the largest puppet theater in the Soviet Union.
	The new theater has two theaters, with 300 and 500 seats respectively. One theater is for children, and the other is used to perform programs for adults.
	The theater has an entire floor dedicated to a museum, which collects various puppets from all over the world. In addition, the theater also has a film shooting laboratory and equipment for television broadcasting.

	Dynamo Stadium to be Rebuilt
	The "Dynamo" Stadium will be built with a huge retractable glass roof. After the roof is completed, the stadium will remain warm and pleasant even in the severe winter, and football matches can still be held. In the summer, the audience in the stadium will no longer feel the heat. At the same time, various sports competitions will no longer be affected by wind and rain.
	Soviet designers have proposed many designs for large glass roofs. The building materials used in these designs are basically reinforced concrete, foamed concrete, and laminated glass. According to the new design, while building the large roof, the stadium will also be expanded and rebuilt into a circular stadium with a diameter of 270 meters. In this way, it can increase more than 20,000 spectator seats, and ten indoor tennis courts and twenty basketball and volleyball courts can be built under the stands.

	New Hotels Under Construction
	This year, construction will begin near the Kremlin on a ten-story hotel that can accommodate 4,500 guests. The hotel will have 2,700 rooms, as well as well-equipped dining rooms, shops, cinemas, and theaters.
	In addition, three hotels will be expanded near the agricultural exhibition hall in the north of the city, and two new hotels will be built in other urban areas. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联设计师已经提出了许多种大玻璃顶盖的设计图案。这些设计所采用的建筑材料基本上都是钢筋混凝土、泡沫混凝土和胶玻璃等。根据新的设计，运动场在修建大顶盖的同时，还将扩大改建成为直径达二百七十公尺的圆形运动场。这样，它将可以增加两万多个观众座位，在看台底下还可以修建十个室内网球场和二十个篮、排球场。
