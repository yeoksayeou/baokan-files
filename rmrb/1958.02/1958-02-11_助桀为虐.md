    Aiding Tyranny

    The racialists in Little Rock, USA continue to persecute black people. A black female student at the local Central High School has been subjected to all kinds of bullying by white students. The school authorities actually ordered the persecuted female student to suspend her studies temporarily.
    
    It seems that the authorities of this school took such measures in order to prevent the continuation of racial discrimination incidents. In fact, this "aiding tyranny" approach is an even more abhorrent act of racial discrimination. It is precisely under the connivance and encouragement of these racists and their sympathizers that some white students in Little Rock dare to become more and more lawless.

    助桀为虐
    美国小石城的种族主义分子继续对黑人进行迫害。当地中央中学的一个黑人女学生受到了白种学生的百般欺凌。学校当局竟勒令被迫害的女学生暂时停学。
    这家学校的当局采取这样的措施，好像是为了防止种族歧视的事件继续发展。实际上它这种“助桀为虐”的做法乃是更可恶的种族歧视行为。小石城的一些白种学生正是在这些种族主义分子及其同情者的纵容和鼓励之下，才胆敢那样愈来愈无法无天。
