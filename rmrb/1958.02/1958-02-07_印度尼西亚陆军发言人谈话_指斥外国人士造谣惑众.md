Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 6th: Indonesian Army Spokesman Harsono stated on February 5th that certain foreign individuals with vested interests in Indonesia are spreading misleading information. These foreign individuals have consistently sought to create chaos in Indonesian politics and economics in order to control the country.

Harsono urged the Indonesian public not to believe such misleading information. He pointed out that the purpose of these messages is to create an atmosphere of confusion and exacerbate the current tensions.

Meanwhile, Antara News Agency also denounced United Press International (UPI) on the same day for continuously issuing speculative reports in recent days about the division of the Republic of Indonesia. One of these reports stated that an "ultimatum" from secessionists had been delivered by former 7th Military District Commander Sumual to President Sukarno, who is currently visiting Tokyo, the capital of Japan.

It is reported that Antara News Agency Director Adam Malik telephoned Antara News Agency in Jakarta from Tokyo, stating that UPI's report that Sumual had presented an "ultimatum" to President Sukarno was a complete lie.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 6th: Mansjur, Chairman of the National Assembly's Defense Subcommittee, told reporters on February 5th that the Indonesian Navy has taken action throughout Indonesian waters to implement the orders and decrees issued by the Indonesian government to crack down on barter trade and smuggling activities that endanger the Indonesian economy.

It is reported that some people have telephoned the Minister of Defense and the Speaker of the National Assembly to request the cessation of the Indonesian Navy's blockade of the sea near the Riau region of Central Sumatra.

Antara News Agency reported that authoritative sources in Jakarta believe that the Navy's actions are necessary because the waters around Riau have in fact been used as a channel for smuggling to Singapore.

Indonesian Attorney General Suprapto and several regional Chief Prosecutors met on the 5th to discuss the issue of combating smuggling.

　　印度尼西亚陆军发言人谈话
    指斥外国人士造谣惑众
    新华社雅加达6日电　印度尼西亚陆军发言人哈索诺2月5日发表谈话说，若干在印度尼西亚拥有既得利益的外国人士散布迷惑人的消息，这些外国人士一直想在印度尼西亚政治和经济方面制造混乱，以便控制这个国家。
    哈索诺要求印度尼西亚公众不要相信这种迷惑人的消息。他指出，这些消息的目的是在制造混乱空气和加剧目前紧张状态。
    同时，安塔拉通讯社同一天斥责合众社最近几天不断发出推测印度尼西亚共和国分裂的消息，其中一条消息说，分裂分子的一项“最后通牒”已经由前第七军区司令苏穆阿尔递交给目前正在日本首都东京访问的苏加诺总统。
    据报道，安塔拉通讯社社长亚当·马利克从东京打电话给雅加达安塔拉通讯社说，合众社报道的苏穆阿尔已经向苏加诺总统提出“最后通牒”的消息是个大谎话。
    新华社雅加达6日电　印度尼西亚国会国防小组委员会主席曼休尔2月5日对报界发表谈话说，印度尼西亚海军已经在整个印度尼西亚海面采取行动，执行印度尼西亚政府颁布的命令和法令，来取缔危害印度尼西亚经济的换货贸易和走私活动。
    据报道，曾经有些人致电国防部长和国会议长要求停止印度尼西亚海军对靠近中苏门答腊的廖内地区海面的封锁。
    安塔拉通讯社报道，雅加达权威人士认为海军的行动是必要的，因为廖内一带海面事实上已经被用来作为向新加坡走私的通道。
    印度尼西亚检察总长苏普拉普托和一些地区的检察署署长5日集会讨论了缉私问题。
