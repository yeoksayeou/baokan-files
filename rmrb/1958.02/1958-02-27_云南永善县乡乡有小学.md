In Yongshan County, Yunnan, every township now has an elementary school, and 63.42% of school-age children are enrolled.

Yongshan is a remote mountainous county where, before liberation, farmers suffered from the brutal exploitation and oppression of Tusi officials and landlord-bullies, resulting in very backward economic and cultural conditions. After liberation, although one middle school was restored and thirty-one elementary schools were established, they could not adapt to the characteristics of the mountainous area due to sparse population, mixed ethnicities, and significant variations in climate and production seasons. Therefore, the masses demanded to run schools themselves. In 1952, they began running fifty-four community-run schools, which were very popular. After the upsurge of cooperativization in 1956, farmers actively ran community-run schools due to a shortage of accountants, scorekeepers, financial custodians, etc. In that year, the number of community-run elementary schools developed to one hundred and seven. Now, there are a total of one hundred and fifty community-run and public schools, with elementary schools in every township, and the number of enrolled students accounts for 63.42% of school-age children, of which 73.8% are from ethnic minorities.

    云南永善县乡乡有小学
    本报讯　云南省永善县乡乡有了小学，63.42％的学龄儿童入学学习。
    永善是个边远山区县，解放前农民受着土司和地主恶霸的残酷剥削　压迫，经济文化都十分落后。解放后，虽然恢复了一所中学，办了三十一所小学，但因人烟分散、民族杂居，加以各处寒热悬殊、生产节令不一，不能适应山区的特点，所以群众都要求自办学校。1952年他们开始办了五十四所民校，很受群众欢迎。1956年合作化高潮后，因缺乏会计、记分员、财务保管员等等，农民积极起来办民校。这一年民办小学发展到一百零七所。现在民办小学和公立学校已共有一百五十所，乡乡都有小学，入学人数占适龄儿童的63.42％，其中少数民族占73.8％。
