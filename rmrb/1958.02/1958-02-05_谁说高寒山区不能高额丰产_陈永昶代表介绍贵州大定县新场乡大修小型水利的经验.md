I fully agree with the various reports of the congress and resolutely implement them. Now, I would like to express my opinion on the situation of small-scale farmland water conservancy construction in Xinchang Township, Dading County, Guizhou Province.

　　Most Rice Paddies are Dry Land, Yielding Only Two Hundred Jin Per Mu
　　Xinchang Township, Dading County, is a high and cold mountainous area. Among the 7,548 mu of cultivated land in the township, 6,224 mu are rice paddies, accounting for 82.46 percent. Among all rice paddies, 4,996 mu are dry land, accounting for 80 percent, with an average yield of only 200 jin per mu. When plowing these dry fields in spring, the land cannot be worked without rain; if it rains, people rush to plow. When plowing the fields after the rain, people often work day and night, using lanterns and torches at night, with men, women, old and young working together. Therefore, the masses call these dry fields "lightning flash fields." Due to the lack of water conservancy and the abundance of dry fields, the township suffered from drought historically, with half of the fields often unable to be planted with seedlings or planted in time. Moreover, incidents of fighting over water, injuries, and deaths of people and livestock occurred frequently. A folk song among the masses says: "Planting seedlings until June, harvesting grain until it snows, threshing straw on the thirtieth night, not even enough rice for the New Year's meal." This vividly depicts the painful situation of agricultural production and life in the township. At that time, the land was in the hands of landlords, and there was no possibility of building any water conservancy projects. After liberation, after the land reform, the township had repeatedly planned to build water conservancy projects, but the results were not significant, and there were still many difficulties at that time. For example, although farmers had been allocated land, they could not use it in a unified manner. In 1954, Xinhe Elementary Cooperative wanted to use the land of Wang Shunchang, a member of Xinmin Elementary Cooperative, to build a pond. After 21 mobilizations by cooperative cadres and members, Wang Shunchang still refused. Therefore, the water conservancy project plan was not realized.

　　Overcoming the Ideology of Emphasizing Large Projects and Neglecting Small Ones, Vigorously Developing Small-Scale Water Conservancy
　　After the realization of advanced cooperativization in 1955, a broad road was opened up for the construction of water conservancy. In the winter of that year, the township party branch put forward the slogan of "Returning every drop of water to the fields, accumulating small amounts into large amounts" for the construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy. However, at that time, there was ideological resistance from some cooperative cadres and the masses. They had the idea of emphasizing large projects and neglecting small ones in the construction of water conservancy, believing that "repairing small mountain ponds and reservoirs is of no use and does not quench thirst; it is better to engage in large projects." Later, the branch went deep among the masses and found concrete facts to illustrate the actual benefits of building small-scale farmland water conservancy from summarizing a local proverb. This proverb says: "The eighteen weirs of the Huang family are better than the river dam fields of the Zeng family." Why are they better? The branch organized the masses to visit and compare on the spot, explaining that although the soil quality of the Zeng family's river dam fields was good and river water could be diverted for irrigation, they were easily subject to floods; moreover, once the river dried up, the fields would run out of water, and there would be no guarantee of increased production. Although the Huang family's fields were "cliff fields" (terraced fields in the mountains), due to the construction of small mountain ponds that stored a large amount of water, irrigation was guaranteed regularly, which could prevent drought and drain field water to plant small crops, resulting in a bumper harvest every year. Therefore, it was said to be better than river dam fields. In this way, the cadres and masses were educated with facts, recognizing that the idea that "small-scale water conservancy is of no use and does not quench thirst" was wrong, and the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for building small-scale water conservancy was enhanced.

　　After the branch educated the cadres and masses to overcome the ideological tendency of emphasizing large projects and neglecting small ones, it immediately convened a meeting of experienced farmers, organizing experienced farmers, party members, youth league members, and activists to observe all parts of the township and conduct on-the-spot planning. According to the natural conditions of the township, it was determined to build mountain ponds and reservoirs universally in places where the land was stable, the water source was long, the water collection surface was wide, and the benefit area was large; in places not suitable for mountain ponds and reservoirs, reservoirs, water storage fields (increasing and thickening the field embankments by two or three feet, and building flood control and drainage holes at the head of the field) were built instead of mountain ponds and reservoirs in places where the water source was long, or where there was a water source, the terrain was high, and the field was sitting in water; at the same time, the method of storing water in large fields to nourish small fields was adopted, using large fields to store rainwater to irrigate small fields to make up for the insufficiency of mountain ponds and reservoirs and water storage fields; and according to possible conditions, river embankments, river dams, and water ditches were built. Such a water conservancy plan was supported by experienced farmers and the masses of the whole township.

　　Next, township cadres, cooperative cadres, and party members all personally started working together. At that time, the snow was frozen, and the branch took the lead in starting work in key areas, with cadres and party members taking the lead in digging mud in the paddy fields. And organized the masses of each cooperative to visit, and also toured deep into the construction sites of each cooperative to guide, using big-character posters, mountain songs, local broadcasts and other forms to disseminate experience and commend good people and good deeds in a timely manner. For example, mountain songs such as: "Snowflakes fluttering, piercingly cold, everyone is united in building ponds, men, women, old and young are all working together, scattered stones are piled up into heaps," greatly inspired the masses. A wave of water conservancy construction was formed throughout the township. However, at the beginning of construction, some cooperative cadres and the masses advocated that the project should be generous and look good, thinking that "if there is no money, the country will give it," and contracted the culverts and pipes of four mountain ponds to stonemasons, which required 420 yuan in wages. If all the projects were done this way, the cost would be even greater. Therefore, the branch convened another meeting of experienced farmers and raised this issue for discussion with everyone. After discussion, it was unanimously decided to learn and repair by themselves without hiring stonemasons. After the meeting, activists such as Wang Hanwen and Wang Shuhua took the lead in learning stonemasonry, and then imparted it to each other among the masses, so that many people mastered stonemasonry technology and all the culverts and pipes were made and repaired by themselves. These four mountain ponds only cost 6 jiao. All 1,561 newly built and repaired water conservancy projects in the township did not require national investment, but only 250 yuan was taken out by the cooperative and 44,300 labor days were spent to complete them.

　　In the construction of water conservancy, the township implemented payment by volume, with fixed time, quality, and quantity, and organized special personnel to inspect and accept, thereby ensuring the quality of all water conservancy projects. In the event of drought, most of the dry fields can maintain drought resistance for half a month to 20 days, and are not threatened by drought. At the same time, the repaired water conservancy projects are all handed over to the beneficiary societies or teams, and experienced people are selected to be responsible for the division of labor for management. Therefore, the management and use of water conservancy in the township for more than two years has always been in good order, and the masses are very satisfied.

　　The Whole Township Forms a Network of Ponds and Ditches, with a Yield of 730 Jin Per Mu
　　After carrying out mass water conservancy construction campaigns in the two winters of 1955 and 1956, the township transformed a section of the river, changing the nine river bends formed by years of flood erosion into one river bend, so that 420 mu of river dam fields were protected from floods; 51 mountain ponds and reservoirs, 11 small river weirs, and 161 drainage ditches and mountain interception ditches were newly built in a planned manner; 49 river embankments and 899 drainage ditches and mountain interception ditches were repaired; and the method of storing water in large fields to nourish small fields was adopted, and 260 new water storage fields were built. These newly built and repaired water conservancy projects formed a network of ponds and ditches in the whole township, so that rainwater had a place to flow and a place to store; and 4,181 mu of dry fields (accounting for 83.7% of the dry field area in the township) were transformed into saturated fields, so that agricultural production achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. The total grain output of the township in 1955 was 3,834,938 jin, which rose to 5,499,267 jin in 1957, an increase of 43.4%; the yield per unit area rose from 500 jin per mu in 1955 to 730 jin in 1957. The three advanced cooperatives in the township sold 1,165,000 jin of surplus grain in 1957, more than one and a half times more than in 1955. After deducting feed, seeds, and completing the state purchase task, the average per capita grain retention in the township was 570 jin, and the cooperative also stored 120,000 jin of grain and 58,000 yuan of public accumulation. At the same time, more than 6,000 jin of carp were raised universally using ditches, ponds, and river water, and more than 6,500 ducks were raised, and sideline income also increased greatly. Therefore, most of the farmers in the township have caught up with the production and living standards of the local well-to-do middle peasants. Among the 1,505 farm households in the township, 907 new houses have been built, and 70% of the households have more than two cotton quilts; 45% of the households have mosquito nets. On average, each household has one and a half pigs and sixteen and a half chickens and ducks. Now the masses call these dry fields "turnover fields," and sing songs such as "High slope water flows into large ponds, dry river water flows into villages; since advanced cooperatives were established, happy days are long," and "Great harvest in fifty-six (referring to 1956), golden grain enters the barn; since the Communist Party came, there is no worry about eating and wearing," to thank and praise the Party and cooperativization.

　　Continue to Build Water Conservancy, Strive for a Yield of 1,000 Jin Per Mu
　　Since the beginning of winter, due to the launch of the socialist education movement in rural areas, and the study and discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses in Xinchang Township has been unprecedentedly high, and the enthusiasm for building water conservancy is particularly high. The township has repaired more than 480 ditches, 34 ponds, 7 water sources, and 86 water storage fields, which can irrigate 2,600 mu of fields in total; and greatly improved the drought resistance of dry fields. It is planned to turn all the dry land that can be turned into fields into good fields this year, and ensure that more than 80% of the fields in the township will no longer be affected by drought. The average grain output of the township will reach 830 jin per mu, and strive to reach more than 1,000 jin.

　　Guizhou is a mountainous area with abundant rainfall, and has good conditions for building small-scale water conservancy. But in the past, our understanding of this was not enough. We always thought that building large-scale ones was better and could solve the problem more effectively. We did not pay enough attention to the construction of small-scale water conservancy in mountainous areas. The fact that Xinchang Township built small-scale water conservancy gave us a great education. We must resolutely implement the central government's policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, rely on the masses, and continue to vigorously build small-scale water conservancy. I believe that after several years of hard work, we will surely be able to make the water conservancy in the mountainous areas of our province form a network of ponds and ditches, realize farmland water conservancy, and turn the barren mountainous areas into "lands of fish and rice."

　　Please criticize and correct the above speech.

　　谁说高寒山区不能高额丰产
    陈永昶代表介绍贵州大定县新场乡大修小型水利的经验
    我完全同意大会各项报告并坚决贯彻执行。现在我就贵州省大定县新场乡兴修小型农田水利的情况，发表一点意见。
    多数稻田是干田  亩产只有二百斤
    大定县新场乡是一个高寒山区，在全乡七千五百四十八亩耕地面积中，有稻田六千二百二十四亩，占百分之八十二点四六。全部稻田中，有干田四千九百九十六亩，占百分之八十，平均亩产只二百斤。这些干田，在每年春耕的时候，不下雨不能打，下了雨要抢着打。群众在雨后打田，往往是白天黑夜不分，夜晚灯笼火把，男女老少一齐干。因此群众将这些干田，叫做“雷光火闪田”。该乡由于水利少，干田多，历史上吃尽了干旱的苦处，每年都有半数的田插不了秧，不能及时栽种。而且争水、打架，人畜伤亡的事故经常发生。群众中有首歌谣说：“栽秧栽到六月，割谷割到下雪，三十夜打谷草，年饭米都不得”。形象地描绘了该乡农业生产、生活痛苦的情景。那时候，土地掌握在地主手里，是根本谈不上修什么水利的。解放后，经过了土地改革，该乡也曾多次筹划兴修水利，但是成绩不很大，当时还有许多困难。例如农民虽分得了土地，但不能统一使用。一九五四年新和初级社要利用新民初级社社员王顺昌的土地修塘，经社干、社员动员了二十一次，王顺昌都不答应。所以修水利的计划没有实现。
　　克服重大轻小思想，大兴小型水利
    一九五五年实现了高级合作化之后，为兴修水利开辟了广阔的道路。这年冬天，该乡党支部提出了“滴水归田、凑少成多”的兴修小型农田水利的号召。但是，当时碰到部分社干和群众的思想抵触，他们对兴修水利存在着重大型、轻小型的思想，认为“修小型山塘水库，无济于事，不解渴，不如搞大的好。”后来支部深入群众，从总结当地流传的一句农谚中，找到了具体事实来说明兴修小型农田水利的实际好处。这句农谚说：“黄家十八堰，胜过曾家河坝田”。为什么能胜过呢？支部组织了群众实地参观、对比，说明了：曾家的河坝田土质虽好，可以引河水灌溉，但容易受洪灾；而且河水一旦干涸，田就断水，增产没有保证。黄家的田虽然是“膀膀田”（半山中的梯田），但由于修筑了小山塘，积蓄了大量水源，经常保证灌溉，既可防旱，又能放干田水种小季，生产上年年获得丰收。所以说它比河坝田好。这样，用事实教育了社干和群众，认识到“小型水利无济于事，不解渴”的想法是错误的，提高了干部和群众对兴修小型水利的积极性。
    支部在教育干部、群众克服了重大型、轻小型的思想倾向之后，紧接着召开了老农会议，将老农、党团员、积极分子组织起来，到全乡各地观测，进行实地规划。根据本乡自然条件，确定在土地稳、水头长、收水面宽、受益面大的地方，普遍修筑山塘水库；不适宜搞山塘水库的地方，就选择水头长、或者是有水源、地势较高、坐水的大丘田，搞蓄水田（加高、加厚田坎各二、三尺，在田头修防洪排水洞）代替山塘水库；同时采取大田蓄水养小田的办法，用大田储备雨水灌小田，以弥补山塘水库和蓄水田的不足；并根据可能条件，修筑河堤、河坝和水沟。这样的水利规划，得到了老农和全乡群众的拥护。
    接着，乡干、社干和党团员都亲自一齐动手。当时冰雪封冻，支部在重点首先开工，干部、党团员带头下滥田挖泥。并且组织各社群众参观，又巡回深入各社工地指导，利用大字报、山歌、土广播等等形式，及时传播经验，表扬好人好事。例如这样的山歌：“大雪飘飘透骨冰，大家筑塘很齐心，男女老少齐动手，分散的石头抬成堆”，给群众的鼓舞很大。全乡各地兴修水利的运动形成了热潮。但是，在动工之初，部分社干和群众，主张工程要大方，图好看，认为“没有钱么，国家会拿”，将四个山塘的涵管和卧管包给石工去做，需开工资四百二十元。如果全部工程都这样做，开支就更大。因此，支部又召开了老农会议，提出这个问题来同大家商量。经过讨论，一致主张自学自修，不请石工。会后，即以王汉文、王树华等积极分子为主，先去学习石工，然后在群众中相互传授，使许多人都掌握了石工技术，将所有的涵管、卧管，全部自打自修。这四个山塘，只花了六角钱。全乡一千五百六十一处新修、补修的水利工程，没有要国家投资，只是由合作社拿出二百五十元，用工四万四千三百个就修成了。
    该乡在兴修水利中，实行以方计酬，定时、定质、定量，组织专人验收，从而保证了全部水利工程的质量。在干旱的情况下，绝大部分的干田，都能保持半月到二十天的抗旱能力，不受旱灾的威胁。同时，把修好的水利，一律交给受益的社或队，挑选有经验的人专责分工看管。因此，该乡两年多来的水利管理和使用，始终有条不紊，群众很满意。
    全乡构成塘群沟网  亩产达到七百三十斤
    经过一九五五年和一九五六年两个冬季，开展了群众性的兴修水利运动以后，该乡改造了一段河流，把多年受洪水冲积成的九道河湾，改成了一道河湾，使四百二十亩河坝田，免受洪灾；有计划地新修了山塘水库五十一个，小河堰十一座，排水沟、拦山沟一百六十一条；补修河堤四十九座，排水沟、拦山沟八百九十九条；并采取了大田蓄水养小田的办法，新扎了蓄水田二百六十丘。这些新修、补修的水利工程，在全乡构成了塘群沟网，使雨水都有流处、蓄处；并将四千一百八十一亩干田（占全乡干田面积的百分之八十三点七）改成了饱水田，使农业生产获得了空前的大丰收。全乡粮食总产量，一九五五年是三百八十三万四千九百三十八斤，一九五七年上升到五百四十九万九千二百六十七斤，增产百分之四十三点四；单位面积产量，由一九五五年的每亩五百斤，一九五七年上升到七百三十斤。全乡三个高级社，一九五七年卖余粮一百一十六万五千斤，较一九五五年多卖一倍半。在扣除饲料、种子和完成国家征购任务以后，全乡每人平均留粮五百七十斤，社内还储备了十二万斤粮和公共积累五万八千元。同时，还普遍的利用沟塘河水饲养鲤鱼六千多斤，喂鸭六千五百多只，副业收入也有很大的增加。因此，全乡绝大部分农户都已赶上了当地富裕中农的生产、生活水平。在全乡一千五百零五户农民中，新盖房屋九百零七间，百分之七十的农户都有两床以上的棉被；百分之四十五的农户用上了蚊帐。平均每户有猪一头半，鸡鸭十六只半。现在群众都把这些干田，叫做“翻身田”，并且唱出：“高坡流水归大塘，干河流水归田庄；自从办起高级社，幸福日子日月长”、“五六年（据一九五六年）来大丰收，金黄谷子进仓头；自从来了共产党，吃不愁来穿不愁”等歌谣，来感激、歌颂党和合作化。
    继续兴修水利，争取亩产千斤
    入冬以来，由于在农村中开展了社会主义教育运动，并且学习和讨论了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），新场乡的农民群众的生产热情空前高涨，兴修水利的劲头特别大。全乡又修沟四百八十余条，塘三十四个，水源七处，蓄水田八十六丘，共可灌田二千六百亩；并大大地提高了干田的抗旱能力。计划今年要把全部能变成田的旱地变成良田，保证全乡百分之八十以上的田再不受旱灾。全乡粮食产量平均每亩达到八百三十斤，争取达到千斤以上。
    贵州是个山区，雨水较多，有兴修小型水利的良好条件。但是我们过去对这点是认识不够的。总以为修大型的好，更能解决问题。对山区的小型水利建设，重视不够。新场乡兴修小型水利的事实，给了我们很大的教育。我们要坚决贯彻执行中央勤俭建国的方针，依靠群众，继续大力兴修小型水利。我相信，再经过几年的艰苦努力，就一定能使我省山区的水利，形成塘群沟网，实现农田水利化，把贫瘠的山区，变成“鱼米之乡”。
    以上发言，请批评指正。
