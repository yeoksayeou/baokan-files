Everywhere is Forever the People's Spring
Xia Kangnong

1958 began with such a grand and fervent momentum. People from all corners of the motherland instructed their representatives to gather in the capital, reporting the heroic achievements of the hundreds of millions of workers and peasants in the production army who are transforming the natural landscape of the motherland. The people of the motherland are undertaking glorious and great undertakings that our predecessors never did. We inherit the language left by our predecessors, but for those who are not good at deeply understanding the breath of this glorious and great era, it is difficult to find appropriate words to describe this overwhelming and magnificent spirit. Representatives from Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, brought the words of many old farmers: "The winter in the Great Northern Wilderness has also turned into spring." To associate with the basis for this sentence, one must think of the vast number of farmers, men and women, young and old, braving snow more than three feet deep and severe cold of minus thirty degrees Celsius, repeatedly breaking production plans, and creating unprecedented "miracles" in local history in water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements. Only then can the old farmers issue such praise, and people can appreciate the meaning of this praise. The people of the motherland everywhere are living in a spring that never fades.

Recalling the early days of national liberation, the most beloved verses sung by the people, besides "The East is Red," were sentences like "The sky in the liberated area is a bright sky." Today, apart from the fact that the term "liberated area" is outdated, and the "bright sky" has been cleared of the last clouds of the bourgeoisie through the people's anti-Rightist struggle and added new meaning, it is true that only by using the word "spring" can we feel that it can express the ever-untiring vitality of 600 million people, because this is the spring of socialism that everyone is convinced of after the national debate on the two roads.

The achievement reports of the worker-peasant armies are a feast for the eyes. The spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has been implemented so vividly and thoroughly that each speech by the worker-peasant representatives constitutes an epic of socialist construction in a certain area of the motherland. The principles of "more, faster, better, and more economical" advocated by the Central Committee have all been transformed into concrete achievements of "large scale, sufficient drive, fast speed, and good quality" in the production practice of the people. "Anshan Iron and Steel has developed into a huge modern joint enterprise," and many of its production indicators "have exceeded the level of the United Kingdom"; workers and brothers in many factories in Shanghai are pointing to the advanced production brands of the United Kingdom and other capitalist countries, setting time plans to catch up with and surpass them. In terms of the number of the labor army and the unleashing of potential, the scale of farmland water conservancy construction is the most inspiring. In just four months, the achievements of Anhui and Henan provinces in this regard are comparable to the total irrigated area completed in the thousands of years of history of the motherland; nationally, "four months of achievement is equal to half of four thousand years." This reminds me of some historians' arguments that one of the reasons for the early formation of the unified country of the motherland was the requirement of farmland water conservancy on the vast plains. If this is indeed the case, then today's working people are surpassing and repaying their ancestors on a scale a hundred or a thousand times greater. The people in the socialist spring have thus redressed the grievances of the working people for thousands of years who could not fully exert their greater strength under the exploitation system.

Such achievements should be profound lessons for each of us! In the small group meetings of this People's Congress, many people are questioning themselves about how to check their "physical fitness" to adapt to such a glorious and beautiful spring, and at the same time, they are confidently speculating on how this year's national economic plan will be overfulfilled item by item. The plan originally put forward by the government has long been estimated to take into account the great potential of the people, comparing it with the experience of the previous years, plus the further rise of the people's revolutionary vigor, thus making many changes and adjustments. Spring is a season of vigorous vitality, and our new annual plan, on the basis of rigorous figures, leaves a lot of elasticity, waiting for the display of the great power of the people.

Are there still people who doubt such a spring? What kind of people would those be!

    到处永远是人民的春天
    夏康农
    1958年开始得这样轰轰烈烈，热火朝天。祖国人民从四面八方叮嘱他们的代表汇集首都，汇报亿万工农生产大军改造祖国自然面貌的英雄战绩。祖国人民在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业，我们继承前人留下的语言，对于不善于深入领会这个光荣伟大的时代的呼吸的人，也就难于找出适当的辞汇，叙述这一派排山倒海、景象万千的气概。黑龙江省肇源县的代表带来许多老农的话：“北大荒的冬天，也变成了春天”。要联想这句话产生的根据，要联想到那里的广大农民男女老少在冒着三尺多深的大雪和零下三十多度的严寒，一再突破了生产计划，在水利和积肥运动上创造出当地史无前例的“奇迹”，这才使得老农们发出那样的赞颂，人们也才能体会这个赞颂的意义。祖国人民到处都生活在永远不谢的春天里面了。
    回想起全国解放初期，人民最爱歌唱的诗句，除了“东方红”以外，要数“解放区的天是明朗的天”这样的句子。今天，这句子除了“解放区”的名词已经过时，“明朗的天”在经过人民反右斗争扫清了资产阶级的最后乌云、添了新的意义以外，确乎只有改用“春天”的字眼，才感觉可以表达六亿人民永远不会懈怠的虎虎生气，因为这是两条道路的全民大辩论以后，人人都信服的社会主义的春天。
    工农大军的战绩汇报，美不胜收。党的八届三中全会的精神，贯彻得这样生动、彻底，工农代表们的每一份发言，构成祖国某一片地区社会主义建设的一篇史诗。中央号召的“多、快、好、省”的原则，到人民生产实践上都化成“规模大、干劲足、速度快、质量好”的各项具体成果。“鞍钢已经发展成为一个巨大的现代的联合企业”，那里的许多生产指标“都已经超过英国的水平”；上海多少工厂的工人弟兄，都在指点着英国和其他资本主义国家的先进生产牌号，定出时间计划赶上和超过它们。从劳动大军的人数和潜力发挥上说，农田水利建设的规模最是振奋人心。才只四个月的时间，安徽、河南两省在这方面的战绩，都是和祖国几千年历史完成的灌溉面积的总和相比拟；就全国来说，“四个月的成就等于四千年的一半”。这使我联想起有的历史学家论述祖国这个统一大国早期形成的原因之一，是广大平原上面农田水利的要求所决定的这个问题。果真如此，今天的劳动人民正在千百倍的规模上赛过也报答了祖先。社会主义春天里的人民，也就这样替千百年劳动人民在剥削制度下不能充分发挥更伟大的力量昭雪了委屈。
    这样的成就，对我们每个人来说，该是怎样深刻的教材！这回人民代表大会的小组会议中，多少人都在盘问自己，该怎样检查“体质”，来适应像这样光荣而美好的春天，同时也在充满信心地揣想今年的国民经济计划将会怎样逐项超额完成。原来政府提出来的计划，是早经估计到人民伟大潜力的发挥，比照着前几年的经验，加上人民革命朝气进一步的昂扬，从而作了多方面的改变和调整。春天是生气蓬勃的季节，我们新的年度计划，在严密的数字基础上，留下了不少弹力，期待着伟大的人民力量的施展。
    还有人疑虑这样的春天的么？那该是一些什么样的人！
