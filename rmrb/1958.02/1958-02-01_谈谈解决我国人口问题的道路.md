　　On the Road to Solving China's Population Problem
　　Wang Zuo
    People are the foundation and subject of social production activities. Without people, there is no social production or existence. In different societies, there are different types of population problems. In capitalist society, the population problem is essentially a manifestation of the antagonistic contradiction between the relations of production and the productive forces, and the contradiction between private ownership excluding the combination of labor and means of production. Socialist society also has its own population problems, especially during the transition period from capitalism to socialism, the population problem is even more significant. In socialist society, the population problem, from a social perspective, mainly manifests as the contradiction between the planned development of the national economy and the supply of labor resources; from the perspective of the family, it mainly manifests as the contradiction between the system of distribution according to labor and the number of children born and raised by individual families; and during the transition period from capitalism to socialism, there are many difficulties left over from the old system, which make the population problem appear as a complex and contradictory image. However, population problems in socialist societies or during the transition period are non-antagonistic contradictions, while population problems in capitalist societies are antagonistic contradictions. Bourgeois rightists, with ulterior motives, confuse these two different types of contradictions, thereby asserting that the new system is not superior to the old system. They believe that we cannot solve China's population problem, and that national industrialization and agricultural modernization are hopeless. We must resolutely expose the conspiracy of rightists to attack the socialist system by using the population problem. At the same time, further exploration is still needed on the correct path to solve China's population problem during the transition period.
    There are different opinions on how to treat and solve China's population problem. One opinion is put forward from the "left". People who hold this view believe that China's current large population and rapid growth are absolutely good things, and they do not admit that there are any difficulties; in their view, advocating birth control is "making a fuss about nothing". When they think about problems and make plans, they often do not start from the perspective of 600 million people, and they often seek excessive scale and speed, divorced from reality. This is "leftist" empty talk in the population problem. Another opinion is put forward from the "right". People who hold this view believe that China's current large population and rapid growth are absolutely bad things. In their view, all difficulties are caused by "too many people", and it is really "difficult" to solve this major contradiction of "too many people". Therefore, they have to pin all their hopes on controlling the 600 million population and making sure that the population does not increase at all, which is a birth control plan divorced from reality. This is right-leaning opportunist thinking on the population problem. Both "leftist" and right-leaning opinions are wrong. If we analyze from the ideological source, they are all absolutists. Good is absolutely good, and bad is absolutely bad. This kind of absolutism has nothing in common with materialist dialectics.
    On the population problem, we oppose both "leftist" empty talk and right-leaning opportunism, because they are both subjectivism, and neither can solve the contradictions that actually exist and must be solved in the population problem. Therefore, they are detrimental to socialist construction and the correct resolution of internal contradictions among the people. We know that people are the most valuable asset in the world, and the direct purpose of social production is for people and their needs. Our Party pointed out that China's large population is a good thing. With a large population, there is an abundance of labor. In a country like China with backward technology, it is unimaginable to complete the technological transformation of the national economy and realize the great ideal of transforming a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country without an abundance of labor. Under the capitalist system, private ownership hinders the combination of labor and means of production, resulting in a large waste of labor; under the socialist system, private ownership is eliminated, and labor becomes a valuable asset of society. In the eight years after liberation, 13 million new employees were added. Not only did a large number of newly grown labor force get employment, but also nearly 4 million unemployed people left over from the old society have been basically resettled. However, our Party also pointed out that a large population also has difficulties. These are difficulties in development, and we already have all the conditions to overcome these difficulties.
    The difficulties mentioned here refer to the following two points: one is in comparison to the large population and China's poor foundation. Specifically, China's foundation is poor, the level of production is low, and there is a shortage of means of production, making it difficult to arrange labor employment; the other refers to the large population and rapid growth. Specifically, the consumer goods that China's industry and agriculture can provide cannot meet the growing needs of the people. Moreover, if each family has too many children and they are born too close together, the burden of life will be too heavy.
    Can we solve China's population problem during the transition period? We say that not only can we solve it, but we have also found the correct path to solve China's population problem during the transition period. The specific content of this path is to promote planned parenthood, publicize and promote birth control; start from the perspective of 600 million people, and make overall arrangements for production, labor, and distribution; and the most fundamental method is to vigorously develop industrial and agricultural production and improve social productivity. Now, let's talk about it from the following four points:
    First, promote planned parenthood. At present, birth control is not only conducive to coordinating the planned development of the national economy and the balance between the supply of labor resources, but also conducive to protecting the health of children and women and the prosperity of the nation.
    Planned parenthood is compatible with the socialist planned economy, while the spontaneous state of population growth contradicts the planned development of the national economy. Moreover, adjusting the speed of population growth by society and implementing birth control under certain conditions are not at all contrary to Marxism-Leninism. Engels predicted the population problem in communist society, saying that in communist society, it is not only possible but also effortless for society to regulate population growth (see Engels' letter to Kautsky, Learning Translation Series, Issue 3, 1957).
    Birth control is one of the important measures to solve China's population problem during the transition period, but it is not a fundamental measure. Because birth control can only alleviate the current difficulties in education and upbringing of newborns, and can only reduce the number of people entering the labor force 15 years later, it cannot solve the difficulties in labor employment during China's industrialization. In this sense, birth control is only one of the ways to solve the population problem. It is unrealistic to regard birth control as the only way to solve China's population problem.
    Second, starting from the perspective of 600 million people, make overall plans for production and construction and labor employment. To build socialism, it is necessary to improve the level of technical equipment in the national economy, which requires sufficient accumulation of means of production. However, China's foundation is poor, and the accumulation of means of production is insufficient. This is a contradiction. Secondly, to improve the level of technical equipment in the national economy, it is necessary to make full use of China's existing abundant labor force. This is another contradiction. How to solve these two contradictions? The only way to solve the contradictions is to start from China's actual situation and adopt correct production and construction policies. Specifically, industrial construction should adopt a policy of combining large-scale enterprises with small and medium-sized enterprises, and combining advanced technology with general technology. However, some people are against this policy. In their view, building socialism requires the establishment of large-scale industries, and small and medium-sized enterprises are likely to hold back industrialization. In fact, this statement is wrong. China's policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale industrial construction is a positive policy, a policy of accelerating construction speed rather than holding back. This is because: 1. Advanced technology large-scale enterprises require a high ratio of means of production equipped for each worker, high investment and fewer employees. In this way, the capital accumulation rate is low. This is because large-scale enterprises take a long time from investment to completion and putting into production, the proportion of materialized labor in the product is large, and the capital recovery speed is slow. 2. Advanced technology large-scale enterprises have low costs, high labor productivity, and provide large accumulation, which is beneficial in the long run. However, in China's current situation of a large population and a poor foundation, it is not beneficial to unilaterally pursue modern large-scale enterprises and ignore small and medium-sized enterprises. Because the one-sided pursuit of advanced technology large-scale enterprises will inevitably make some people enter production and equip a lot of means of production, while others will not be able to enter labor production due to the lack of equipment of means of production. As a result, a part of the people who have already entered labor production have to support another part of the people who cannot enter labor production temporarily, wasting the available labor force. Moreover, under certain conditions, the one-sided pursuit of advanced technology large-scale enterprises is not completely reasonable in terms of accelerating capital accumulation.
    It can be seen that in countries with a large population and a poor foundation, in order to accelerate industrialization, it is necessary not only to arrange the proportion of accumulation funds and consumption funds (people's living standards), but also to be good at using limited accumulation funds (that is, to rationally arrange the combination of labor and means of production). That is to say, in the important sectors of the national economy, it is necessary to establish large-scale enterprises with advanced technology, while in general sectors, it is necessary to establish more small and medium-sized enterprises with general technology. In this way, it can not only improve labor productivity, but also make full use of labor force, so that advanced technology enterprises and general technology small and medium-sized enterprises can provide funds to equip general technology enterprises and gradually carry out the comprehensive technical transformation of the national economy. (The policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale enterprises in industrial construction has many advantages, which will not be discussed here.) The above is from the perspective of industrial construction policies, from the overall national economy, it is also necessary to rationally arrange the investment ratio of industry and agriculture, that is, on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, implement simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. In addition, the production and construction within agriculture should also implement the policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale, with less investment and quick results.
    However, small and medium-sized enterprises also have shortcomings, such as high costs. Therefore, socialism does not favor small and medium-sized enterprises, but only under certain conditions, the implementation of the policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale enterprises is conducive to overcoming difficulties and accelerating construction speed, rather than just wanting small and medium-sized enterprises and not large-scale modern enterprises.
    The above is from the production and construction aspect, studying how to start from the perspective of 600 million people, arrange production and construction work, in order to fully utilize China's abundant labor resources. This is very important. However, it is not enough to only pay attention to this aspect. In order to solve the labor employment problem, it is also necessary to open up employment avenues from many aspects. With the development of China's industry, construction, commerce, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings, although a part of the labor force can be absorbed; however, due to China's large population and the large number of new labor force growing up every year, in order to comprehensively solve the labor employment problem, it must face agriculture, because agriculture can accommodate a larger amount of labor force after the transformation of the relations of production. Therefore, for the surplus labor force in cities, they should be mainly encouraged to go to the mountains and the countryside to participate in agricultural labor.
    Third, it is necessary to correctly use the socialist distribution system to regulate the increase in population, and at the same time, starting from the perspective of 600 million people, make overall arrangements for the distribution of consumer goods. Under the socialist system, the distribution of consumer goods is not based on the "supply system" principle of equal distribution according to population, nor on the communist principle of distribution according to needs; but also to use the bourgeois legal standards, that is, to distribute according to the quality and quantity of each person's labor. This system of distribution according to labor is contradictory to the number of people each social member supports. People with low incomes may support more people, while people with high incomes may support fewer people. But this distribution system plays a role in regulating the speed of population growth within a certain limit.
    It should be pointed out that China's excessive population growth is related to the shortcomings in our implementation of the distribution system according to labor. For example, the wage standards for young intellectuals and junior staff who have just started working are too high, and the promotion is too fast; the apprenticeship period is too short, and the treatment is too high, which actually stimulates early marriage and early childbearing, and also increases the difficulty of employment arrangements. The wage standards for ordinary workers and odd-job workers in urban-rural integration areas are too high, which is also an important reason why the rural population flows to the cities and the urban population is unwilling to go to the countryside and the mountains. In terms of social welfare facilities, we have done many good things, but some aspects have gone too fast, and some projects have been done too much. The practice of inappropriately emphasizing that difficulties should be borne by the public is also a factor that stimulates the acceleration of population growth. During the first five-year plan, the expenditure of supplementary wages and various welfare expenses of state organs, enterprises, and institutions is expected to account for 19.2% of the total wage bill. Adding the part of the funds used by the state for social, cultural, educational, health, and social welfare that employees enjoy, it will reach more than 25% of the total wage bill, which is obviously a bit too much. In the specific implementation of welfare subsidy measures, there are phenomena that violate the principle of distribution according to work. For example, the welfare subsidy measures stipulate the standard living expenses for the individual each month, and the standard living expenses for family members are stipulated separately for urban and rural areas (urban is higher than rural). If it is not enough, they can apply for long-term subsidies from the public. Due to the implementation of this method, the number of children has increased, and under certain circumstances, the family living burden has not increased. This method also plays a role in encouraging more children. In order to correctly use the distribution system according to labor and regulate the speed of population growth, the shortcomings existing in the above-mentioned distribution system should be gradually improved.
    In order to facilitate overcoming the difficulties in arranging labor employment, the distribution of consumer goods should be appropriately arranged starting from the perspective of 600 million people. Specifically, it is to improve the wage system, implement a low-wage system, so that the difference between the lives of workers and peasants is not too large, and try to ensure that everyone has food to eat. In this way, the same amount of consumer goods can arrange more labor employment.
    Fourth, vigorously develop the production of industry and agriculture, and implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and managing the family diligently and thriftily. This is the most fundamental way to solve China's population problem during the transition period. Because the fundamental reason why China's laborers cannot be fully employed and the people's lives cannot be improved quickly is no longer the restriction of private ownership relations of production, but the lack of means of production and consumer goods. The only way to solve this problem is to develop production. China will complete the task of technological revolution of the national economy in the next fifteen years or more, so that social productivity can be fully developed, and catch up with and surpass Britain in terms of steel and major industrial product output; so that laborers can get relatively full employment, and the people can live a life of sufficient clothing and food. In forty to fifty years, our production level will catch up with and surpass the most advanced capitalist countries. At that time, we will be able to guarantee full employment for laborers, so that the people can live a prosperous life with abundant clothing and food, thereby fundamentally solving China's population problem. We are certain that we can do this today, when the Chinese working people have become the masters of historical development.

　　谈谈解决我国人口问题的道路
　　王琢
    人是社会生产行为的基础和主体，离开了人就谈不到社会生产和社会存在。在不同的社会里，就有不同性质的人口问题。在资本主义社会里，人口问题实质上是生产关系同生产力之间对抗性矛盾的表现，是私有制排斥劳动力同生产资料相结合的矛盾。社会主义社会也有它自己的人口问题，特别是从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期，人口问题更是一个重大的问题。在社会主义社会里，人口问题就社会方面来说，主要表现为国民经济有计划地发展同劳动资源供应之间的矛盾；就家庭来说，主要表现为按劳分配制度同个别家庭生育抚养的子女多少的矛盾；而从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期里，还有旧制度遗留下来的许多困难，更使人口问题表现为一个错综复杂的矛盾形象。然而不论是在社会主义社会里或过渡时期里的人口问题，都是非对抗性的矛盾，而资本主义社会的人口问题则是对抗性的矛盾。资产阶级右派，别有用心地把两种不同性质的矛盾混同起来，从而断言新制度不比旧制度优越。他们认为，我们不但不能解决我国的人口问题，而且国家工业化、农业现代化也是没有指望的。我们必须坚决揭穿右派分子利用人口问题攻击社会主义制度的阴谋。同时，对解决我国过渡时期人口问题的正确道路，仍须作进一步的探索。
    在如何对待与如何解决我国人口问题上，是有不同意见的。一种是从“左”的方面提出来的意见。持这种意见的人，认为我国目前人口多、增殖快是一件绝对好的好事，他们不承认有什么困难；在他们来看，提倡节制生育是“小题大做”，他们在想问题，定计划的时候，往往不从六亿人口出发，往往贪大图快，脱离实际。这就是人口问题上的“左”倾空谈主义。一种是从“右”的方面提出来的意见。持有这种意见的人，认为我国目前人口多、增殖快，是一件绝对坏的坏事。在他们看来，一切困难都是“人多”引起的，要解决“人多”这个大矛盾，真是“难矣哉”。于是，他们只好把一切希望寄托在控制住六亿人口，使人口一个不能多的这种脱离实际的节育计划上面。这就是人口问题上的右倾机会主义思想。不论是“左”的或右的意见，都是错误的。如果从思想根源来分析，他们都是绝对主义者。好是绝对的好，坏就是绝对的坏。这种绝对主义同唯物辩证法之间没有任何共同之点。
    在人口问题上，我们既反对“左”倾空谈主义，又反对右倾机会主义，因为它们都是主观主义，都不能解决在人口问题上实际存在而又必须解决的矛盾，因而对于社会主义建设和正确解决人民内部矛盾都是不利的。我们知道，人是世界上最宝贵的财产，社会生产的直接目的是为了人及其需要。我们党指出，我国人口多是一件好事，人多，劳动力就丰富，而在我国这样技术落后的国家里，要完成国民经济的技术改造，要实现变落后的农业国为先进的工业国的伟大理想，没有丰富的劳动力是不可想像的。在资本主义制度下，由于私有制阻碍着劳动力同生产资料的结合，大量浪费了劳动力；在社会主义制度下，私有制消灭了，劳动力就成了社会的宝贵财产。解放后的八年中，新增加职工一千三百万人，不仅大批新成长的劳动力得到就业，旧社会遗留下来的近四百万失业人员，也已经基本上得到安置。但是，我们党也指出，人口多也有困难，这是发展中的困难，而且，我们已经有了克服这种困难的一切条件。
    这里所说的困难，是指这样两点说的：一是就人口多同我国底子穷比较而言的，具体地说，就是我国底子穷，生产水平低，生产资料不足，安排劳动就业还有困难；一是指人口既多增殖又快而言的，具体地说，就是我国工农业所能提供的消费品，还不能满足人民日益增长的需要。而且每个家庭生育的子女过多、过密，也就会发生生活负担过重的困难。
    我们能不能解决我国过渡时期的人口问题呢？我们说，不但能解决，而且已经找到了解决我国过渡时期人口问题的正确道路。这个道路的具体内容就是提倡计划生育，宣传与推广节制生育；从六亿人口出发，统筹安排生产、劳动和分配问题；而最根本的办法是大力发展工农业生产，提高社会生产力。现在，我们分以下四点来谈：
    第一，提倡有计划地生育子女。在目前，节制生育不仅有利于协调国民经济的有计划的发展和劳动资源供应之间的平衡，并有利于保护儿童和妇女的健康和民族的繁荣。
    计划生育是和社会主义计划经济相适应的，而人口增殖的自流状态和国民经济有计划发展是矛盾的。并且，社会对人口增殖速度进行调节，在某种条件下推行节育这件事，和马克思列宁主义也毫无抵触。恩格斯对于共产主义社会的人口问题就曾预言说，在共产主义社会里，社会对人口增殖进行调节，不仅是可能的，而且是毫无困难的（见恩格斯给考茨基的信，1957年学习译丛第3期）。
    节制生育是解决我国过渡时期人口问题的重要措施之一，但它还不是根本的措施。因为，节制生育只能减轻目前对新生人口的教、养方面的困难，只能减少十五年以后进入劳动生产队伍的人数，并不能解决我国工业化期间劳动就业方面的困难，从这个意义来说，节制生育还只是解决人口问题的办法之一，那种把节制生育当作解决我国人口问题的唯一办法，是不现实的。
    第二，从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾地安排生产建设和劳动就业问题。建设社会主义，要提高国民经济部门的技术装备水平，这就必须要有足够的生产资料的积累，但是我国底子穷，生产资料的积累不足，这是一个矛盾；其次，要提高国民经济的技术装备水平，又必须充分利用我国现有的丰富的劳动力，这又是一个矛盾。如何解决这两个矛盾呢？解决矛盾的唯一道路是从我国现实情况出发，采取正确的生产建设的方针。具体说，工业建设应当采取大型企业和中小型企业相结合，先进的技术和一般技术相结合的方针。但是，有些人是反对这个方针的，在他们看来，建设社会主义就要建立大工业，中小型企业是容易拖住工业化的后腿的。其实，这种说法是错误的。我国采取大中小相结合的工业建设方针，是积极的方针，是加快建设速度而不是拖后腿的方针。这是因为：一、先进技术的大型企业，要求每个工人装备的生产资料比率高，投资大而用人少。这样，资金积累率就低。这是因为大型企业从投资到建成投入生产的时间长，产品中物化劳动占的比例大、资金收回速度慢的缘故。二、先进技术的大型企业，成本低、劳动生产率高，提供的积累大，从长远来看，是有利的，但是，在人口多、底子穷的我国现状下，片面追求现代化的大型企业，忽视中小型企业，却是不利的。因为片面追求先进技术的大型企业，势必使一部分人进入生产，要装备很多的生产资料，而另一部分人就因缺乏生产资料的装备，无法进入劳动生产，其结果只好由一部分已经进入劳动生产的人养活另一部分暂时还不能进入劳动生产的人，浪费了可以利用的劳动力。何况在一定的条件下片面追求先进技术的大型企业，从加快资金积累速度来说，也是不完全合理的。
    由此可见，在人口多底子穷的国家里，为了加速工业化，不仅要安排积累资金和消费基金的比例（人民生活水平），同时，还要善于运用有限的积累资金（即合理地安排劳动力同生产资料结合）的政策。这就是说，在国民经济的重要部门，要建立先进技术的大型企业，而在一般部门，又要多建立一般技术的中小型企业，这样，既能提高劳动生产率，又能充分利用劳动力，使先进技术的企业和一般技术的中小企业都提供资金，来装备一般技术的企业，逐步进行国民经济的全面技术改造。（在工业建设中实行大中小型企业相结合的方针，好处是多方面的，这里就不多谈了）以上是就工业建设方针来说的，从国民经济总体来说，还要合理的安排工业和农业的投资比例，即在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工农业并举。此外，在农业内部的生产建设也要贯彻大中小结合、投资少而收效快的方针。
    但是中小型企业也有缺点，例如成本较高等，所以，社会主义并不偏爱中小型企业，只是在一定条件下，实行大中小型企业相结合的方针，有利于克服困难，加快建设速度，而不是只要中小型企业不要大型的现代化的企业。
    以上是从生产建设方面研究如何从六亿人口出发，安排生产建设工作，以充分利用我国丰富的劳动资源问题。这是很重要的。但是，只注意这个方面还不够，为了解决劳动就业问题，还要从多方面广开就业门路。随着我国工业、建筑、商业以及文教卫生事业的发展，虽然可以吸收一部分劳动力；但是，由于我国人口众多，每年新成长的劳动力很多，全面解决劳动就业问题，必须面向农业，因为农业在生产关系变革之后，能够容纳更大量的劳动力。因此，对于城市多余的劳动力，主要地应该鼓励他们上山下乡，参加农业劳动。
    第三，既要正确地运用社会主义分配制度，调节人口的增殖，又要从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾地安排消费品的分配。在社会主义制度下，消费品的分配，不是按人口多少平均分配的“供给制”原则，也不是按需要分配的共产主义原则；而是还要利用资产阶级的法权标准，即按每人劳动的质与量进行分配。而这种按劳分配的制度同每个社会成员的抚养人口多少是有矛盾的，收入少的人可能抚养的人口多，而收入多的人，抚养人口反而可能少。但是这种分配制度，在一定限度内起着调节人口增殖速度的作用。
    应当指出，我国人口增殖过快，和我们在执行按劳分配制度上的缺点有关。例如，对于刚刚走上劳动岗位的青年知识分子、低级工作人员的工资标准偏高，升级过快；学徒期限过短，待遇偏高等，实际上起着刺激早婚、早生子女的作用，并且也增加就业安排的困难。城乡结合部的普通工、勤杂工的工资标准偏高，也是农村人口涌向城市，和城市人口不愿下乡上山的重要原因。在社会福利设施方面，我们办了许多好事，但是某些方面走得快了，某些项目办得多了。而不适当地强调有困难归于公家包下来的做法也是刺激人口增殖速度加快的因素。第一个五年计划期间，国家机关、企业事业单位的附加工资和各项福利费用的支出，预计要占工资总额的19.2％，加上国家用于社会的文教卫生和社会福利等经费中职工享受的部分，就达到工资总额的25％以上，显然是多了一点。而在具体执行福利补助办法的时候，又有违反按酬分配的原则的现象。例如，在福利补助办法中，规定本人每月标准生活费，家属分城乡规定标准生活费（城市比乡村高），不足的部分，可以申请由公家长期补助。由于执行这种办法，子女增多了，在某种情况下，家庭生活负担并不加重，这种办法也起了鼓励多生子女的作用。为了正确利用按劳分配制度，调节人口增殖速度，对于上述分配制度存在的缺点，应当逐步加以改进。
    为了有利于克服安排劳动就业工作的困难，对于消费品的分配，应当从六亿人口出发，进行适当安排。具体地说，就是改进工资制度，实行低工资制，使工农生活相差不要过大，尽量做到使大家都有饭吃。这样，同量的消费品就能更多地安排劳动就业。
    第四，大力发展工农的生产，厉行勤俭建国，勤俭持家方针，这是解决我国过渡时期人口问题的最根本道路。因为，目前我国劳动者还不能充分就业，人民生活不能很快提高的根本原因，已经不是私有制生产关系的限制，而是生产资料和消费品的不足。而解决这个问题，只能走发展生产的道路。我国将在今后的十五年或者更多的时间内，完成国民经济技术革命的任务，使社会生产力获得充分的发展，在钢铁和主要工业品产量方面赶上并超过英国；使劳动者得到比较充分的就业，使人民过着足衣足食的生活。而在四十年到五十年的时间内，使我国的生产水平赶上并超过最先进的资本主义国家，到那个时候，我们能够保证劳动者的充分就业，使人民过着丰衣足食的富裕生活，从而根本地解决我国的人口问题。这一点，在我国劳动人民已经成了历史发展的主人的今天，我们是一定能够办得到的。
