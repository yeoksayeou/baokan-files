    Cultivating a Love for Labor from a Young Age
    Yangjingdi Elementary School Organizes Diverse Production Activities

    (Our report) Yangjingdi Elementary School in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, has thoroughly implemented the principles of diligent and thrifty production, combining work and study, and running the school diligently and thriftily. In the past year, it has saved the state more than 1,230 yuan in funds and purchased teaching equipment. Among the school's 240 students, 69 have achieved self-sufficiency through their labor income during spare time and holidays. The school aims to save the state 2,000 yuan this year.

    Yangjingdi Elementary School is a newly established school with a relatively weak foundation and poor equipment in all aspects. The desks and benches were incomplete, and the teaching aids consisted of only a few wall charts; there was no sports equipment at all. The school leadership proposed the call to run the school diligently and thriftily, and demanded that everyone "overcome difficulties and run the school well with their own hands," which was warmly supported by the teachers and students. Teachers and students used their spare time to repair the classroom podium, paint office desks, repair desks and benches, and whitewash the walls, giving the school a new look. Township and commune cadres and the masses also actively supported this approach. They voluntarily donated wood to build three new classrooms for the school. This event further encouraged the students. Under the leadership of the teachers, the entire school collected manure for one hour every morning. In seven days, they collected 3,500 jin of manure and 295 dan of ash fertilizer.

    The teachers at this school combine teaching with guiding students in productive labor, opening up an experimental plot of eight fen, planting 24 kinds of crops, enabling 100 students in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades to learn the planting and management techniques of crops such as Beijing melons, radishes, sunflowers, and potatoes. They harvested more than 700 jin of vegetables, more than 60 jin of corn, and 11 jin of oilseeds, selling them for more than 30 yuan, which was used to purchase equipment such as jump ropes and balls for the school. The school organized students to plant 20,000 trees on Sundays and sowed 60 jin of pine seeds on barren hills, receiving a bonus of 24 yuan from the agricultural cooperative. During spare time, students were organized to carry more than 500 bricks for the soil and water conservation cooperative, earning 24 yuan in compensation. This money was used to purchase steamers, stoves, and books for the students.

    Yangjingdi Elementary School not only paid attention to students' collective labor to increase school equipment and change the school's appearance, but also emphasized students' individual labor, increasing their income. Over the past year, students have participated in activities such as accumulating fertilizer, digging medicinal herbs, raising pigs, collecting wild vegetables, braiding straw hat braids, and raising chickens, enabling 69 of the school's 240 students to achieve self-sufficiency, accounting for about 40% of the school's students. Gu Chunxiu, a fourth-grade student, earned more than 25 yuan in the past year by engaging in labor such as digging medicinal herbs, braiding straw hat braids, and chopping firewood during spare time. After paying the full year's tuition of more than nine yuan, she had more than fifteen yuan left over, increasing the family income. Students in the fifth and sixth grades of this school used their summer and autumn vacations and Sundays to participate in agricultural labor in the commune, each working an average of more than 20 workdays, totaling more than 30 yuan. Even the lowest earned more than 18 yuan, fully covering their tuition fees with a surplus.

    Currently, all teachers and students in the school are summoning up socialist vigor, actively studying and intensifying their labor.

    从小就培养热爱劳动的习惯
    羊井底小学组织多种多样生产
    本报讯　山西省平顺县羊井底小学，由于贯彻了勤俭生产、勤工俭学、勤俭办校的方针，一年来，为国家节省资金一千二百三十多元，购置了教学设备。全校二百四十名学生，其中六十九名学生利用课余、假期的劳动收入，已达到自供自读。争取在今年内为国家节约两千元。
    羊井底小学是一个初办的学校，基础比较薄弱，各方面的设备也较差；桌凳残缺不全，教学用具仅有几张挂图，体育设备一无所有。学校领导上，提出了要勤俭办校的号召，并要求大家“用自己的双手，克服困难，办好学校”，得到广大教师和学生的热烈支持。教师和学生利用业余时间修好了教室的讲台，油漆办公桌，修理桌凳，粉刷墙壁，使学校面貌焕然一新。乡社干部和群众也积极支持这个作法，他们自动捐献木料，为学校修盖了三间新教室。这事情，更鼓舞了学生的干劲，在教师的带领下，全校学生每天早上拾粪一小时，在七天中，即拾粪三千五百斤，积灰肥二百九十五担。
    这个学校的教师结合教学指导学生生产劳动，开辟了一块八分大的实验园地，种植了二十四种作物，使四、五、六年级一百名学生都学会了北京瓜、萝卜、向日葵、马铃薯等作物的种植和管理技术。他们收获了七百多斤蔬菜，六十多斤玉茭和十一斤油料，共卖了三十多元，给学校购置了跳绳、皮球等用具。学校组织学生利用星期日植树两万株，在荒山播种六十斤松籽，得到农业社奖金二十四元；课余组织学生给水土保持社搬砖五百多块，得报酬二十四元，这些钱用来为学生购置蒸笼、灶具和图书等。
    羊井底小学不仅注意了学生的集体劳动，增加学校设备，改观了学校面貌，而且重视了学生的个体劳动，增加了他们的收入。一年来，学生参加积肥、刨药材、养猪、打野菜、编草帽辫、喂鸡等活动，使全校二百四十名学生中有六十九名学生达到了自供自读，约占全校学生的40％。四年级学生谷春秀，一年来利用课余时间从事刨药材、编草帽辫、打柴等劳动，收入二十五元多，除缴全年学费九元多外，还余下十五元多，增加了家庭收入。这个学校五、六年级的学生，利用暑、秋两个假期和星期日参加社里的农业劳动，每人平均做了二十多个劳动日，共计三十多元，最低的也有十八元多，全部学费自供自读还有节余。
    目前，全校师生正在鼓起社会主义干劲，积极学习加紧劳动。
