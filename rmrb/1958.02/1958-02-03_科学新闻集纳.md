　　The Highest Milk-Producing Sheep
　　Northwest Agricultural College has successfully bred a flock of the highest milk-producing sheep. The average annual milk yield of this flock in 1957 reached 1006.6 kilograms per head. Among them, Sheep No. 383 produced 1639.15 kilograms of milk in its first lactation period (317 days), setting a new record for the highest milk yield.
　　Northwest Agricultural College originally had a Saanen dairy goat, which had a low milk yield and poor physique. In 1952, the average milk yield per head was 423 kilograms, and the weight was only 45 to 50 jin. After 1953, Liu Yinwu, an associate professor in the Animal Husbandry Department of the college, carried out postnatal breeding of this kind of sheep, and achieved great results by adopting scientific feeding management methods. Now, this kind of sheep not only has a high milk yield, but also gains weight quickly, with an average weight of 50 to 70 jin per head.
　　New Breed of Domestic Chicken
　　Zhang Jianshi, a professor at Northwest University, used blood transfusions to conduct asexual hybridization and selection experiments on domestic chickens. After three generations of experiments, he has obtained a new breed. This new breed of chicken is heavier than its original parents, has a higher egg production rate, more tender muscle fibers, and a higher fat content. The protein and fat content in the eggs have also increased. At the same time, they grow rapidly, develop quickly, are lively, and have strong resistance.

　　产奶最多的羊
    西北农学院饲养成功了一群产奶最高的羊。这群羊在1957年的年产奶量每头平均达到一千零六点六公斤，其中三八三号羊第一产奶期（三百一十七天）就产奶一千六百三十九点一五公斤，创造了产奶量最高纪录。
    西北农学院原来有一种萨能奶羊，产奶量低、体质差，1952年每头平均产奶量四百二十三公斤，体重只有四十五到五十斤。1953年以后，这个学院畜牧系副教授刘荫武对于这种羊进行后天培育，采用科学的饲养管理方法，获得了很大的成效。现在这种羊不但产奶量高，而且体重也增加很快，平均每头体重五十到七十斤。
    家鸡的新品种
    西北大学教授张见石使用输血的方法，进行家鸡无性杂交选种的试验，经过三代试验的结果，已经获得一个新品种。这种新品种鸡比原亲体重，产卵量高，肌肉纤维柔嫩、脂肪含量多，卵内蛋白质及脂肪都有所增加；同时，生长迅速、发育快、活泼、抵抗力强。
