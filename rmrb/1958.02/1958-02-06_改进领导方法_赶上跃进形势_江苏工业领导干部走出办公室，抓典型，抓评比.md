Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 5th: Industrial leadership departments in Jiangsu Province are actively improving their leadership methods in order to catch up with the current Great Leap Forward situation in industrial and agricultural production.

Leaving the office, changing work styles, going deep into the grassroots, grasping advanced examples, grasping typical examples, and carrying out evaluations to promote a Great Leap Forward in industrial production throughout the province is what leaders and cadres of various industrial departments are determined to do. The person in charge of the Textile Industry Department recently led a group of cadres to textile factories in Wuxi City to discover advanced individuals and advanced examples among the masses from all aspects, in order to promote the current production. The Handicraft Industry Bureau put forward the slogan "What the countryside needs, we provide," and sent working groups to Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and other places to investigate the needs of the countryside for agricultural tools.

Many units' leading cadres are learning from the experience of "cultivating experimental plots" and are preparing to cultivate experimental work sections and experimental work areas. The director and deputy directors of the Textile Industry Department decided to cultivate experimental work sections in textile factories in Nanjing. By cultivating experimental work sections, they require themselves to work with the workers to study and solve the main problems in current production, study how to combine political work with economic work, learn production knowledge, and closely connect with the masses. They plan to learn two or three operating methods within a year. The director, deputy directors, and some section chiefs of the Industrial Department are prepared to select experimental points in factories in Nanjing and other places according to the industries they are responsible for. They plan to participate in production for at least two months each year, requiring themselves to learn the operating techniques of one type of work within three years.

Some units are also preparing to organize visiting groups to visit advanced areas and learn advanced experience and Great Leap Forward experience.

    走出办公室，转变作风，深入基层、抓先进、抓典型、抓评比，推动全省工业生产大跃进，这是各个工业部门领导干部决心要做到的。纺织工业厅负责人最近率领一批干部深入到无锡市的纺织工厂，从各方面发现群众中的先进人物、先进事例，以推动当前的生产。手工业管理局提出“农村要什么，我们给什么”的口号，并派出工作组到徐州、淮阴等地调查农村对农具的需要情况。
    许多单位的领导干部学习“搞试验田”的经验，准备搞试验工段和试验工区。纺织工业厅的厅长、副厅长，决定在南京的纺织工厂里搞试验工段。他们通过搞试验工段，要求和职工群众一起研究解决当前生产上的主要问题，研究政治工作怎样同经济工作相结合，学习生产知识，密切同群众的联系。他们计划在一年内学会两三种操作方法。工业厅的厅长、副厅长和一些处长准备根据各人分工负责的行业，分别在南京等地的工厂选择试验点。他们准备每年至少有两个月参加生产，要求三年学会一种工种的操作技术。
    有些单位，还准备组织参观团，访问先进地区，学习先进经验和跃进经验。
