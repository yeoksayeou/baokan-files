The Standards for "Great Leap Forward" and "Promotion"
　　Kong Sang
　　After reading the overall plan of Qinxian United Processing Plant to support agriculture, everyone will be pleasantly surprised. Such a small county-run factory, what great ambition! In order to support the county's agriculture to cross the Yellow River in five years and surpass the Yangtze River in ten years, they have taken on all the instruments and equipment needed for water conservancy projects in the entire county; they decided to design and manufacture various machines and new tools themselves, and save 500,000 labor forces for farmers this year; the various fertilizers they manufacture can be used for nearly one-third of the county's farmland; they have undertaken all the surveying, drilling, design, and installation and repair work of all machines in the county; they will carry out various processing businesses to make full use of the county's local products; they have also formulated a plan to train technical personnel for agricultural cooperatives throughout the county... Look, what kind of factory is this! For the county, it is simply the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Academy of Sciences, and the Industrial University combined. A county with such a factory will fundamentally change the local natural and economic landscape in three years. What is there to worry about success!
　　Reading this plan gives us a new understanding of the words "Great Leap Forward" and "Promotion." For an enterprise or a department, what is the standard for judging "Great Leap Forward" and "Promotion?" Is it called "Great Leap Forward" simply because the development is greater than in the past few years? Is it called playing a "promoting" role for others simply because it provides more products to the user departments than in the past? According to the advanced example of Qinxian United Processing Plant, it is already outdated to compare with the past behind closed doors. The new standard should be: in the entire economic development, either take the lead and be at the forefront; or when others are already leading, be able to closely follow their footsteps. For local industries that mainly serve the rural economy, in the current situation where agricultural production is taking the lead, the standard is to meet the needs of agriculture to the greatest extent. Some factories were "underfed" in the past, but now they are "full," and they feel that the support for agriculture is already "doing their best." Such factories should look at the plan of Qinxian United Processing Plant and reflect on themselves: this "effort" may not really have been "exhausted." Look at how much Qinxian United Processing Plant wants to do and can do! The small circle of the factory can no longer contain them. Their eyes are on the entire rural economy; and they see not only the current urgent needs, but also the needs of rural development in the next three, five, or ten years. They plan their work based on this need, so that they can breathe and pulse together with the local agriculture and move forward side by side. This is called a real Great Leap Forward and a real promoter.
　　We think that what Qinxian United Processing Plant can do, other county-run industries should also be able to do. If we don't have the foundation this year and can't do it, we will definitely do it next year, the year after, and the year after that. We look forward to the day when every county has such a strong technical center to support and promote agricultural reform. At that time, what it will bring us will be a fundamental change in the entire rural technical landscape.

### “跃进”和“促进”的标准

　　“跃进”和“促进”的标准
　　孔桑
    读了沁县联合加工厂全面支援农业的规划，谁都会惊喜交集。一个小小的县营工厂，气魄够多么大！为了支持本县的农业在五年内跨过黄河、十年内越过长江，他们竟然把全县水利工程需要的仪器和设备全部包了下来；他们决定自己设计和制造各种机械和新工具，要在今年内为农民节约五十万个劳动力；他们制造的各种肥料，可供全县将近三分之一以上的农田使用；他们把全县一切工程的测量、钻探、设计和一切机器的安装、修配工作，全部承担了下来；他们要举办各种加工业务，以充分利用全县的土特产；他们还制订了为全县的农业社培训技术人材的计划；……请看，这哪里是一个工厂！对县里来说，简直是重工业部、轻工业部、科学院、工业大学兼而有之。一个县拥有这样一个工厂，要在三年内使当地的自然面貌和经济面貌基本改观，真是何患不成！
    读了这个规划，使我们对于“跃进”、“促进”这些字眼，有了新的认识，新的理解。对一个企业、一个部门来说，什么是判断“跃进”和“促进”的标准？仅仅比过去几年发展的幅度大一些，就叫“跃进”吗？仅仅给使用部门提供了比过去多的产品，就叫对别人起了“促进”作用吗？按照沁县联合加工厂这个先进的榜样看来，关起门来同过去比，这个标准已经陈旧了。新的标准应当是：在整个经济发展当中，或者是一马当先，走在最前面；或者是当别人已经领先的时候，自己的脚步能够紧紧地跟上去。对主要为农村经济服务的地方工业来说，在当前农业生产一马当先的情况下，这个标准就是最大限度地满足农业的需要。有些工厂过去“吃不饱”，现在吃“饱”了，就觉得对农业的支援已经是“尽力而为”。这样的工厂看了沁县联合加工厂的规划，有必要反躬自省：这“力”未必是真正已经“尽”了。请看，沁县联合加工厂所要做的，所能够做的事情有多少呢？工厂的小圈子早已圈不住他们。他们的眼睛看的是整个农村经济；而且不仅看到当前的急需，还看到了今后三年、五年、十年农村发展的需要。他们就是根据这个需要来规划自己的工作，使自己和当地的农业共呼吸、同脉搏，并肩前进。像这样的，才叫做真正的跃进，真正的促进派。
    我们想，沁县联合加工厂能做到的，别的县营工业也应当能够做到。今年没有基础，做不到；明年、后年、大后年一定会做到。我们期待着这样一天：每个县都拥有这样一个强有力的支持和推进农业改革的技术中心。那时候，它给我们带来的，将是整个农村技术面貌的根本变化。
