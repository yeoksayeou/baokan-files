Biography of Comrade Cachin

    Marcel Cachin, an outstanding activist of the French and international workers' movement, and one of the founders and leaders of the French Communist Party, was born on September 20, 1869. He actively participated in the workers' movement during his student days. In 1891, he joined the Workers' Party led by Guesde. Cachin was a defender of the Marxist direction of the French workers' movement, and he actively participated in the activities of organizing the unified French Socialist Party. From 1906 to 1912, he served as the representative of the Socialist Party's propaganda headquarters, and in January 1912, he became the editor-in-chief of "L'Humanité."
    The Great October Socialist Revolution had a tremendous revolutionary impact on the workers' movements in various countries. In February 1920, the Strasbourg Congress of the French Socialist Party passed a resolution to withdraw from the Second International and sent Cachin to Moscow to establish contact with the Third International. Cachin attended the Second Congress of the Third International in Moscow and met with Lenin. After returning to his country, he delivered speeches at many mass rallies, expounding the great significance of the October Socialist Revolution to the working people, exposing the faces of the opportunist leaders of the Socialist Party, and calling for the establishment of a genuine revolutionary Marxist party. At the Tours Congress of the Socialist Party in December 1920, Cachin led the revolutionary faction that advocated joining the Third International. The congress passed a resolution to join the Third International with a majority vote. This laid the foundation for the establishment of the French Communist Party.
    Since 1918, Cachin had been the director of "L'Humanité" (which became the organ of the French Communist Party after the Tours Congress). Since the founding of the French Communist Party, Cachin has been a member of the Central Committee and the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. From 1924, he served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, and later was elected as a member of the Presidium of the Executive Committee, until the dissolution of the Communist International in 1943.
    During the Spanish War (1936-1939), Cachin did everything possible to organize aid to Republican Spain and exposed the criminal "non-intervention policy." In 1935, Cachin was elected as the first Communist senator.
    During World War II, Cachin, as one of the leaders of the resistance movement, led the secret printing of "L'Humanité" and engaged in uniting all democratic and progressive forces in the country to fight against fascism.
    After the war, Cachin was elected as a member of the Constituent Assembly and the National Assembly. He was committed to safeguarding France's national independence against American imperialism and against the colonial war in Indochina. He also actively participated in the peace movement. As a close comrade-in-arms of Thorez and Duclos, he tirelessly fought to strengthen the party's ranks and improve the ideological level of party members.
    Last year, on his eighty-eighth birthday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided to award him the Order of Lenin for his many years of tireless work in strengthening the friendship between the people of France and the Soviet Union. (Xinhua News Agency)

    加香同志传略
    法国和国际工人运动的杰出活动家、法国共产党的创建人和领导人之一马赛尔·加香生于1869年9月20日。他在学生时代，就积极参加了工人运动。1891年他加入了盖德所领导的工人党。加香是法国工人运动马克思主义方向的捍卫者，他积极参加了组织统一的法国社会党的活动。1906到1912年他任社会党宣传总部的代表，1912年1月任“人道报”总编辑。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命对各国的工人运动起了巨大的革命影响。1920年2月，法国社会党斯特拉斯堡代表大会通过决议退出第二国际，并派加香到莫斯科去同第三国际建立联系。加香在莫斯科出席了第三国际第二次代表大会，会见了列宁。他回国以后在许多群众集会上发表演说，向劳动人民阐述十月社会主义革命的伟大意义，揭露了社会党机会主义领导人的面目，并号召建立一个真正的革命的、马克思主义政党。在1920年12月社会党都尔代表大会上，加香领导了主张加入第三国际的革命派。代表大会以多数票通过加入第三国际的决议。这就奠定了建立法国共产党的基础。
    自1918年起，加香就任“人道报”（它在都尔代表大会以后成为法国共产党的机关报）社长。自法国共产党成立时起，加香就是法共中央委员和中央政治局委员。1924年起，他任共产国际执行委员会委员，以后又当选为执行委员会主席团委员，一直到1943年共产国际解散为止。
    西班牙战争（1936—1939年）期间，加香尽一切力量组织了对共和西班牙的援助，揭露了罪恶的“不干涉政策”。1935年，加香被选为第一个共产党参议员。
    第二次世界大战期间，加香作为抵抗运动的领导人之一领导着“人道报”的秘密印行工作，并从事团结全国一切民主进步力量和法西斯作斗争。
    战后，加香当选为立宪议会和国民议会的议员。他致力于维护法国的民族独立反对美国帝国主义、反对在印度支那的殖民战争。他并积极参加了和平运动。作为多列士和杜克洛的亲密战友，他一直不倦地为加强党的队伍、提高党员的思想水平而斗争。
    去年，当他八十八岁寿辰时，苏联最高苏维埃主席团由于他多年为加强法苏两国人民的友谊而孜孜不倦地工作，因而决定授予他列宁勋章。（新华社）
