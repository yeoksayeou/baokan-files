Xinhua News Agency, 9th: TASS reports: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government held a grand reception in the Kremlin on the evening of the 8th, to entertain representatives of famous Soviet intellectuals.

The leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government who attended the reception were: Aristov, Belyayev, Brezhnev, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Ignatov, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Suslov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, Pospelov, Korotchenko, Kalnberzin, Kirilenko, Kosygin, Mzhavanadze, and Pervukhin.

Suslov, Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, delivered a brief welcome speech at the meeting.

Then, Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, delivered a long speech, which was warmly welcomed by the attendees.

Academician Kurchatov, the famous physicist, spoke at the meeting, expressing his warm gratitude to the Communist Party and the government for their high evaluation of the work of Soviet scientists. He said that we Soviet scientists are an inseparable part of our people, and only by relying on our people and their heroic labor can we solve such huge scientific problems and technical tasks, such as the creation of the atomic industry, the manufacture of new aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and artificial earth satellites. He said that there is now no problem that Soviet science cannot solve.

Subsequently, Khrushchev spoke to the writers. He said that the works of Soviet writers help consolidate all that is beautiful, upright, conscious, and advanced; they teach us to hate all that is vicious, despicable, and inhuman, and to actively fight against them. The artists of language are helping the Party in the great cause of educating the people in communism.

Tikhonov, one of the oldest writers in the Soviet Union, then spoke. He said that Soviet writers are proud of their destiny, because they have served the ideas of the great Party, Marxism-Leninism, for forty years, and they are serving progressive mankind.

Bulganin, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, proposed a toast to the Soviet film workers. He said that Soviet film masters have created many inspiring and truthful works full of communist ideals. Last year was a year of further upsurge in the multi-ethnic Soviet film art. The responsibility of film workers is to improve their skills and always remember the growing needs of the Soviet people.

The famous film director Aleksandrov said in his reply speech, we thank the Central Committee of the Party and the government, but we understand that we have not yet reached a high level. We believe that Soviet films will fulfill the tasks facing the film art.

Pospelov, Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, talked about Soviet music in his speech. He said that last year was a year of harvest for Soviet music. The outstanding Soviet composer Shostakovich said that in the history of musical art, there has never been a period like the present that has such excellent conditions for developing the composer's genius, skills and art.

Mikoyan, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, spoke to the workers of the multi-ethnic drama art of the Soviet Union. He pointed out that in the past year, they have done a lot of good work. Soviet People's Artist Tsarev expressed his gratitude to the CPSU Central Committee in the name of the playwrights, and thanked Mikoyan for his high evaluation of Soviet drama work. He said that we believe that it is our sacred duty to create dramatic works that reflect the rich and colorful spiritual life of our times and our people.

Many famous artists also participated in the reception. Suslov, Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, mentioned them in his speech. He pointed out that Soviet art, which is closely linked with the people and the Party, is developing and prospering. The unprecedented scale of the 1957 Soviet Fine Arts Exhibition vividly and eloquently proves this point. Soviet People's Artist Yuon represented all the artists in his reply speech, expressing his gratitude to the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee for its tireless care for Soviet fine arts.

Subsequently, Voroshilov made a brief speech, in which he proposed a toast to medical scientists and medicine. Academician Scriabin, a biologist, pointed out that the purpose of the work of biologists and doctors is to make people healthy and long-lived. Therefore, we can say: long live peace, because life and peace - this is synonymous, where there is peace, there is life.

Comrade Khrushchev made the final speech. He wished the Soviet people's intellectuals successful fruitful activities, and wished them vigor and good health, and he also mentioned the names of many people present. Those present responded to Comrade Khrushchev's final speech with stormy applause.

The reception took place in an extremely warm and cordial atmosphere. It symbolizes the close and inseparable connection between scientific, technological and cultural workers and the Party and the government, and also symbolizes their unity around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government.

    出席招待会的苏联共产党和政府的领导人有：阿里斯托夫、别利亚耶夫、勃列日?夫、布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、伊格纳托夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫、波斯别洛夫、科罗特钦科、卡恩别尔津、基里连科、柯西金、姆日阿瓦纳泽和别尔乌辛。

    著名的物理学家库尔查托夫院士在会上讲了话，他向共产党和政府对苏联科学家的工作的崇高评价表示热烈的感谢。他说，我们苏联科学家是我国人民不可分割的部分，他们只有依靠我国人民及其英勇的劳动，才能解决这样一些巨大的科学问题和技术任务，如创立原子工业，制造新式飞机、洲际弹道火箭和人造地球卫星。他说，现在没有任何问题是苏联科学所不能解决的。
    随后，赫鲁晓夫向作家们讲话。他说，苏联作家的作品帮助巩固一切美好的、正直的、有觉悟的和先进的事物，它们教导我们憎恨一切凶恶的、卑鄙的、惨无人道的东西，并且对它们作积极的斗争。语言艺术家正在帮助党对人民进行共产主义教育的这一伟大事业。
    苏联最老的作家之一吉洪诺夫接着讲了话。他说，苏联的作家为自己的命运感到自豪，因为他们已经为伟大的党的思想、为马克思列宁主义服务了四十年，他们是为进步人类而服务的。
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁建议为苏联电影工作者干杯。他说，苏联电影大师创造了不少充满着共产主义理想的、激动人心的真实作品。去年是多民族的苏联电影艺术进一步高涨的一年。电影工作者的责任是改进自己的技能，随时记住苏联人民日益增长的需要。
    有名的电影导演亚历山德罗夫在致答词中说，我们感谢党中央委员会和政府，但是我们明白，我们还没有达到高度的水平。我们认为苏联电影会完成摆在电影艺术面前的任务。
    苏共中央书记波斯别洛夫在讲话中谈到苏联音乐。他说，去年是苏联音乐丰收的一年。杰出的苏联作曲家萧斯塔科维奇说，在音乐艺术史上从来没有一个时期像现在这样具备着如此优越的条件来发展作曲家的天才、技巧和艺术。
    苏联部长会议副主席米高扬对苏联多民族的戏剧艺术工作者讲了话。他指出，在过去一年中，他们的工作做得又多又好。苏联人民演员查列夫以戏剧家的名义向苏共中央表示感谢，感谢米高扬对苏联戏剧工作的崇高评价。他说，我们认为，创作反映我们时代和我国人民的丰富多采的精神生活的戏剧艺术作品是我们神圣的职责。
    参加招待会的还有许多著名的美术家。苏共中央书记苏斯洛夫在讲话中提到了他们。他指出，同人民和党有密切联系的苏维埃艺术日益发展和繁荣。1957年苏联造型艺术展览会的规模空前巨大，就生动和雄辩地证明了这一点。苏联人民美术家尤昂代表全体美术家致答词，他向苏共中央主席团表示感谢，感谢它对苏联造型艺术的不倦的关怀。
    随后，伏罗希洛夫作了简短的发言，他提议为医学家和医学干杯。生物学家斯克里亚宾院士指出，生物学家、医生的工作的目的就是使人健康长寿。因此，我们可以说：和平万岁，因为生命与和平——这是同义词，那里有和平，那里就有生命。
    赫鲁晓夫同志作了最后发言。他祝苏联人民的知识分子的富有成果活动获得成功，祝他们精神饱满、身体健康，同时他还提到许多在座人的名字。到会的人对赫鲁晓夫同志的最后发言报以暴风雨般的掌声。
    招待会在极其热烈和亲切的气氛中进行。它象征着科学、技术和文化工作者同党和政府的紧密而不可分割的联系，也象征着他们在苏联共产党和苏联政府周围的团结一致。
