    Such a "Revolutionary Government"
    A small group of rebels in Indonesia has established a so-called "revolutionary government" in Central Sumatra. What "revolution" does this "revolutionary government" want to "revolve"?
    According to the exposure of the "Indonesian Torch Newspaper," this government has long been colluding with foreign imperialism and has reached an agreement with Mobil and the other two major oil companies: If this small group of rebels seizes power, it can transfer the mining rights of two million hectares of oil fields; return the North Sumatra oil fields to the Dutch oil company. The rebels have also sent representatives everywhere to exchange the transfer of mining rights for support and recognition of the "revolutionary government."
    Seeing this news, people will suddenly realize that the "revolutionary government's" one of the five "revolutionary" principles: "developing the region's rich resources" is actually to revolutionize the independence and sovereignty that the Indonesian people have gained through long-term struggle, and drag Indonesia back into the tragic fate of a colony.
    If we further compare the political goals put forward by this "revolutionary government," which mainly attacks Sukarno's guided democracy and clamors against communism, with Dulles' attack on Sukarno at a press conference, shouting that "the Communist Party's influence on the Java government is growing," they are exactly the same. Then, the counter-revolutionary essence of this "revolutionary government" has been nakedly exposed. The "opposition to Sukarno" and "anti-communism" shouted by these rebels are nothing but a smokescreen for them to carry out counter-revolutionary activities and undermine the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism.

### 如此“革命政府”

    如此“革命政府”
    印度尼西亚的一小撮叛乱分子，在中苏门答腊成立了一个所谓“革命政府”。这个“革命政府”要“革”的是什么“命”呢？
    据“印度尼西亚火炬报”的揭露：这个政府早已同外国帝国主义有了勾结，同美孚等三大石油公司达成了协定：如果这一小撮叛逆分子夺得了政权，可以出让二百万公顷油田的开采权；把北苏门答腊的油田交还荷兰石油公司。叛逆分子并且还派代表四出，以出让开采各种矿产权来换取对“革命政府”的支持和承认。
    看到这些消息，人们就会恍然大悟，这个“革命政府”在提出的五项“革命”原则之一：“开发本地区的丰富资源”，原来就是要革掉印度尼西亚人民经过长期斗争得来的独立和主权，把印度尼西亚拖回到殖民地的悲惨命运里去。
    如果我们再对照一下，这个“革命政府”提出的政治目标，主要是攻击苏加诺的有领导的民主，并叫嚣反共，又同杜勒斯在记者招待会上攻击苏加诺，叫嚷“共产党对爪哇政府的影响越来越大，”如出一辙。那么，这个“革命政府”的反革命实质，已经赤裸裸地暴露出来。这些叛乱分子所大喊大叫的“反对苏加诺”和“反共”，不过是他们进行反革命活动、破坏印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义斗争的烟幕而已。
