    Zhengzhou, February 27th (This newspaper) – The expansion project of the Ji-Wei main canal, China’s largest Yellow River irrigation project, commenced construction in Henan Province on February 20th. Along the nearly 300-li long main canal, a 200,000-strong labor force from all over the country is working with revolutionary fervor to ensure the entire project is completed by April 25th and water is released on May 1st.
    This main canal runs north along the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway from Qinchang in Wuhi County on the north bank of the Yellow River, passing through Huojia and Xinxiang to Zhoujiawan in Ji County, where it flows into the Wei River. It is nearly 300 li long and can draw 280 cubic meters per second of flow, irrigating 4.7 million mu of land in the northern Henan Province and the Tianjin and Cangxian special districts of Hebei Province. It can increase grain production by 1.4 billion jin annually and generate 11,100 kilowatts of cheap electricity. Due to the increased water volume, 50-ton freighters can navigate year-round from Xinxiang City, Henan Province, to Tianjin City.

    引黄灌溉济卫扩建工程开工
    本报郑州27日电　我国最大的引黄灌溉济卫总干渠扩建工程，2月20日在河南省动工修建。在长达近三百里的总干渠上，来自全国各地的二十万劳动大军正以革命干劲争取在4月25日前全部竣工，5月1日开始放水。
    这条总干渠是从黄河北岸武陟县的秦厂沿京广铁路北上，经获嘉、新乡到汲县周家湾注入卫河。全长近三百里，能引二百八十个秒公方流量，可灌溉河南省豫北地区和河北省天津、沧县两专区的四百七十万亩土地，每年能增产粮食十四亿斤，还可发出一万一千一百瓩廉价电力。由于水量增大，从河南省新乡市到天津市可全年通航载重五十吨的火轮。
