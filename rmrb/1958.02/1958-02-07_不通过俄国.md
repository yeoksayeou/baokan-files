A Little Chat on Current Affairs

    "It (the American satellite) will never pass through Russia." (United Press International, Washington, February 1st). This statement is both clear and vague. The hostility towards "Russia" is obvious, but why won't "it" ever pass through Russia? Is it unwilling to pass? Or is it unable to? In short, this is not made clear.

    Could it really have class character, therefore unwilling to pass through Russia? However, the class character of American spies is strong enough, but they still try every means to sneak into the Soviet Union. Could it be ashamed to be seen by the Soviets? Because it is clearly several months behind the Soviet satellites. But then again, maybe not, as its American masters are using it to boast loudly.

    Then it is unable to pass through. American planes carrying hydrogen bombs can fly over Britain, but dare not go over the Soviet Union. It's not that they don't want to, but that they really can't. What's more, "Dr. Egan, a leading scientist at the Royal Observatory in Britain, said today that the British Isles would probably never see the American 'Explorer' earth satellite." (Agence France-Presse, London, February 1st). It can't even fly to "Great Britain," so how could it reach the Soviet Union? (Yan)

### 不通过俄国

    不通过俄国
    “它（美国卫星）将永远不通过俄国。”（合众社华盛顿1日电）。这话又明确又含糊。对“俄国”的敌意是明显的，但“它”为什么永远不通过俄国呢？是不想通过呢？还是不能通过？总之，这点没有说明白。
    难道它真的也有阶级性，因此不想通过俄国？然而美国间谍的阶级性就够强的了，但它们还是要千方百计的钻进苏联去。莫非它是羞于见到苏联人吗？因为它明明落后于苏联卫星好几个月了。然而又未必，它的美国主子不就正在用它大吹大擂。
    那末它是不能通过的了。载有氢弹的美国飞机，可以在英国上空飞翔，却不敢到苏联上空去，非不为也，实不能也。何况，英国“皇家天文台的主要科学人员埃甘博士今天说，不列颠岛大概会永远看不到美国的‘探险者’地球卫星。”（法新社伦敦1日电）它连“大不列颠”飞不到，哪里又能到苏联去？（延）
