Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Jakarta: Indonesian major party leaders have issued statements regarding the illegal establishment of a so-called "revolutionary government" by the Central Sumatra rebel group.

Soewirjo, Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), pointed out that since the Hussein group has formed a "government," the central government is now more than ever able to take clear and resolute action against them with a more determined attitude.

Mohammad Mansjur, a PNI leader and chairman of the parliamentary defense subcommittee, stated that the rebellion by Hussein and his accomplices is the most serious act of lawlessness since Indonesian independence. He hopes the government will take resolute measures until the rebels are suppressed.

Wahab, a central committee member of the Nahdlatul Ulama (Islamic Scholars Association), said on the 17th that although the Indonesian nation, in principle, does not want to see bloodshed, the facts currently created in Central Sumatra have made reconciliation very difficult.

The Jakarta "People's Daily" published a written statement by Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), on the 18th. The statement pointed out that the Central Sumatra conspiracy demonstrates that the recent rebel activities of domestic reactionaries in Indonesia, aided by imperialists, have reached a climax. He pointed out that the areas occupied by the rebels have been and will continue to be used by foreign forces as bases to infringe upon the Republic of Indonesia. Aidit said that resolute and swift measures must be taken to deal with the rebellion of the Sjafruddin and Hussein groups and their supporters. A hesitant attitude will only give foreign forces more opportunities to help the rebels create division and chaos within the country. This will benefit the Dutch colonialists, who are looking for opportunities to attack the Republic of Indonesia. Aidit advocated further mobilizing and uniting all forces to support the central government in crushing the rebels' conspiracy.

The Masyumi Party also issued a statement on the Central Sumatra incident on the 17th. The statement argued that the action of establishing a "revolutionary government" in Central Sumatra is unconstitutional, but the party also attacked the current cabinet and the National Council as "unconstitutional."

The Indonesian Ministry of Intelligence issued a statement on the 17th regarding the Central Sumatra rebel group's announcement of the establishment of a so-called "revolutionary government," saying that the government will take "natural" measures against this event in accordance with Prime Minister Djuanda's report to the parliament on February 3.

In that report, Prime Minister Djuanda said, "The government will take decisive steps to deal with any attempt to issue a declaration of establishing a so-called state or government."

On the 17th, Prime Minister Djuanda reported the recent situation in Indonesia to President Sukarno, who had just returned from abroad. Also present were the three Deputy Prime Ministers and Army Chief of Staff Nasution.

On the evening of the 17th, the cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss the recent domestic situation. At the same time, the government and military authorities continued to take measures against elements related to the Central Sumatra rebel group.

Army Chief of Staff Nasution, based on the decision of the cabinet meeting on the evening of the 17th, announced the dismissal of Lieutenant Colonel Somba, commander of the North and Central Sulawesi Defense Region, and Major Lentulambie, chief of staff of the region, and suspended the activities of the North and Central Sulawesi Defense Region Command. The armed forces of this defense region were ordered to contact the Eastern Indonesia Military Region Command. According to Antara News Agency's Manado dispatch on the 17th, Somba announced at noon on the 17th his support for the so-called "revolutionary government" of the Central Sumatra rebel group.

On the 17th, the Army Chief of Staff also ordered all parts of the country to take measures against those elements who use propaganda activities, such as posting slogans or publishing books, to support the so-called "revolutionary government."

The North Sumatra Military Authorities issued a statement on the 17th regarding the establishment of a so-called "revolutionary government" in Central Sumatra. The statement stated that they only recognize the Djuanda government as the legitimate government and prohibit the North Sumatra government and military organizations from accepting or executing orders or instructions from the illegal government. Violators will be severely punished.

At the same time, Paliun, acting commander of the Second Military Region of South Sumatra, issued an order through the radio, saying that he demanded "avoiding the use of force" within his jurisdiction and that he required his subordinates to be constantly vigilant against "the possibility of undermining the attitude of reconciliation based on the principles of consultation and tolerance and aimed at avoiding civil war."

    印度尼西亚各大政党领袖发表谈话
    要求采取坚决措施镇压叛乱
    情报部宣布政府将对叛乱集团采取行动
    北苏门答腊军事当局声明支持中央政府
    本报综合报道　据新华社雅加达电：印度尼西亚各大政党领袖对中苏门答腊叛乱集团非法成立所谓“革命政府”的事件发表了谈话。
    印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约指出，由于侯赛尼集团已经成立了“政府”，因此，中央政府比过去任何时候都能够以更加坚定的态度对他们采取明确而坚决的行动。
    国民党领袖、国会国防小组委员会主席穆罕默德·曼休尔发表声明说，侯赛尼和他的同谋者的叛变活动是印度尼西亚独立以来最严重的违法乱纪的行动。他希望政府采取坚决的措施，直到把叛乱分子镇压下去为止。
    伊斯兰教师联合会中央委员瓦哈布在17日说，虽然印度尼西亚国家在原则上不希望看到发生流血事件，但是，目前在中苏门答腊造成的事实已经使和解成为很困难了。
    雅加达“人民日报”在18日刊载了印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地的书面声明。声明指出，中苏门答腊的阴谋表明，在帝国主义者帮助下的印度尼西亚国内反动分子最近进行的叛乱活动已经达到了高潮。他指出，被叛乱分子盘踞的地区已经而且将要继续被外国势力用作侵害印度尼西亚共和国的基地。艾地说，必须采取坚决和迅速的措施去对付沙弗鲁丁和侯赛尼集团及其支持者的叛乱活动。犹豫不决的态度只能使外国势力有更多机会去帮助叛乱分子在国内造成分裂和混乱。这将有利于在找寻机会进攻印度尼西亚共和国的荷兰殖民主义者。艾地主张进一步动员和团结一切力量支持中央政府去粉碎叛乱分子的阴谋。
    马斯友美党在17日也就中苏门答腊事件发表了声明。声明认为在中苏门答腊成立“革命政府”的行动是不符合宪法的，但是，这个政党同时也攻击目前的内阁和民族委员会“不符合宪法”。
    印度尼西亚情报部17日就中苏门答腊叛乱集团宣告成立所谓“革命政府”一事发表声明说，政府将根据朱安达总理2月3日在国会所作的报告对这一事件采取“当然的”措施。
    朱安达总理在那次报告中说，“政府将采取断然的步骤来对付任何尝试发布成立所谓国家或政府的宣言的企图。”
    朱安达总理在17日向刚从国外回来的苏加诺总统报告了最近印度尼西亚的局势，在场的还有三位副总理和陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安。
    17日晚间，内阁举行了紧急会议讨论了最近的国内局势。同时，政府和军事当局继续对与中苏门答腊叛乱集团有关的分子采取了措施。
    陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安在17日晚间根据当晚内阁会议的决定，宣布解除北、中苏拉威西防区司令宋巴中校和这个防区的参谋长伦土拉姆比少校的职务，并且停止北、中苏拉威西防区司令部的活动。这个防区的武装部队奉命同东印度尼西亚军区司令部取得联系。据安塔拉通讯社17日万鸦老消息，宋巴在17日中午宣布支持中苏门答腊叛乱集团的所谓“革命政府”。
    陆军参谋长在17日还命令全国各地对那些用张贴标语或者出版书籍等方式进行宣传活动去支持所谓“革命政府”的分子采取措施。
    北苏门答腊军事当局17日就中苏门答腊成立所谓“革命政府”一事发表声明。声明表示，他们只承认朱安达政府是合法的政府，并且禁止北苏门答腊政府和军事组织接受或执行非法政府的命令或指示。违者将受严厉处分。
    同时，南苏门答腊第二军区代理司令巴利安通过电台发布命令说，他要求在他所辖地区内“避免使用武力”，并且要求他的部下时刻警惕“以协商和容忍的原则为基础、以避免内战为目的的和解态度遭到破坏的可能性”。
