    Notes
    Deliberately Mystifying
    In order to defend Britain's "nuclear deterrent" policy, Macmillan suddenly made a deliberately mystifying statement on the 23rd, saying: "I am very interested to see that some people who do not want hydrogen bombs are the most hostile to the United States, and they very much hope to make our policy not subservient to the United States." The implication is: "I advocate that Britain possesses hydrogen bombs in order not to be subservient to the United States. And you want not to be subservient to the United States, but you oppose Britain's manufacturing of hydrogen bombs. Isn't this self-contradictory?"
    In fact, things are not as interesting as Macmillan thinks. The British government's insistence on manufacturing hydrogen bombs is not a symbol of independence, but a thorough subservience to the United States' policy of expanding its armaments and preparing for war. Precisely because of this, the British people who oppose subservience to the United States naturally oppose the British government's pursuit of a hydrogen bomb policy. This is completely reasonable. The logic created by Macmillan cannot find any foothold for his anti-people policy.
    Similarities and Differences
    The economic recession in the United States is increasingly serious, and the Eisenhower government cannot come up with any effective measures to deal with it, so there are widespread complaints in the United States. On the 21st, the Democratic National Committee of the United States also took the opportunity to attack the Republican government for being slow to take action to alleviate the "depression that the United States is facing" and criticized Eisenhower for treating the unemployment problem with "the attitude of Herbert Hoover."
    Eisenhower may feel greatly wronged by this criticism from the Democratic Party. Because Hoover, who gained the infamous name of "Hunger President," adopted a "strict non-intervention policy" towards the economic crisis during the Great Depression of 1929; while Eisenhower and his deputy Nixon, although they have done nothing and do not intend to do anything to prevent the trend of increasing unemployment, have said a lot of empty words such as "never sit idly by."
    Very Promising
    James Topping, a city councilor in Youngstown, Ohio, was arrested for defrauding the American Cooperative Insurance Company of $100,000. It is said that this person is usually considered to be one of Youngstown's "most promising young Democrats" and is planning to run for mayor.
    This reminds people of another "most promising young Republican," US Vice President Nixon, who also caused a stir some time ago due to the scandal of corruption and bribery. The US Congress even conducted a serious investigation, but it ended without a conclusion. From this, it can be seen that although James Topping has lost his way for a while, because he has a set of skills in deception, in the American political arena of deceit and betrayal, his future is indeed immeasurable.

    札记
    故弄玄虚
    为了替英国的“核威慑”政策辩解，麦克米伦在23日忽然故弄虚玄地说：“我很感兴趣地看到，不想要氢弹的某些人是对美国最抱有敌意的人，他们很希望使我国的政策不屈从美国。”言下之意是：“我主张英国拥有氢弹，是为了不屈从美国。而你们既想不屈从美国，又反对英国制造氢弹，这不是自相矛盾吗？”
    其实事情并不像麦克米伦所认为的那样有兴趣。英国政府硬要制造氢弹的做法并不是什么独立的象征，而是彻头彻尾对美国扩军备战政策的屈从。正是因为这样，所以反对屈从美国的英国人，也就当然要反对英国政府追求氢弹的政策。这是完全合乎情理的。麦克米伦创造的这种逻辑丝毫不能为他反人民的政策找到什么立脚点。
    同中有异
    美国经济衰退日益加剧，艾森豪威尔政府拿不出任何有效的办法来，因而美国国内怨声四起。美国民主党全国委员会21日也乘机攻击共和党政府迟迟不采取行动来和缓“美国正在面临的萧条”，抨击艾森豪威尔用“赫伯特·胡佛的态度”来对待失业问题。
    艾森豪威尔对于民主党的这种批评，可能会觉得大受委屈吧。因为获得“饥饿总统”臭名的胡佛，在1929年经济大危机的时候对经济危机是采取“严格的不干涉政策”的；而艾森豪威尔和他的副手尼克松虽然没有做什事，也不打算作什么事来阻止失业人数继续增加的趋势，但是却讲了不少“决不坐视”一类的空话哩。
    大有希望
    美国俄亥俄州扬斯顿城一个名叫詹姆士·托平的市议员，因为从美国协作保险公司里骗取了十万美元而被捕。据说，这个人平常被认为是扬斯顿的一个“最有希望的青年民主党人”，并且还正在打算竞选市长。
    这倒使人想起另外一个“最有希望的青年共和党人”美国副总统尼克松，前些时候也因为贪污受贿的丑事败露而闹得满城风雨，美国国会还煞有介事地进行过一番调查，结果不了了之。由此可见，詹姆士·托平虽然一时失风，但是由于他有一套行骗的本领，在美国尔虞我诈的美国政治舞中，倒确是前途未可限量的。
