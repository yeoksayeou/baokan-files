    Poverty Does Not Dim Ambition
    Jing Yu
    In recent months, news of the great leap forward in local industry has been flying in like snowflakes. The Yuxi Special Zone in Yunnan Province plans to basically achieve farmland irrigation, agricultural semi-mechanization, rural electrification, and fertilizer chemicalization within five years, which is particularly encouraging.
    It is a remarkable thing to be able to achieve rural modernization in five years. The Yuxi Special Zone was originally a poor place. Before 1953, they not only had to buy general industrial products from other places, but even the simplest handicraft products had to be transported from other places: feather dusters from Guangdong, bamboo chopsticks from Sichuan, and carrying poles from Guizhou. They had a large amount of hides but could not make leather, so they had to sell hides and buy leather; they had a large amount of wood but could not make utensils, so they had to sell wood and buy buckets. Their situation was so poor and their foundation was so weak, but once they started industry, the development speed was so amazing and the ambition was so grand. Isn't this a remarkable thing?
    What force is driving the rapid development of their local industry? According to the Secretary of the Yuxi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, it is "being forced to start." That is, after the agricultural and handicraft industries were collectivized, the demand for local industry in rural areas became more and more demanding, and the situation of relying on external supply could no longer be maintained. In other words, the poor situation forces them to fight against poverty. Therefore, poverty is not a terrible thing, and poverty also has its advantages: it stimulates people's revolutionary will, promotes people's courage to forge ahead, and changes the poor face of society. As the saying goes, poverty does not diminish ambition. As long as we have ambition and are determined to transform nature and develop resources, then we can go from nothing to something, from small to large, turn poverty into wealth, and transform unfavorable factors into favorable factors.
    Of course, the poverty mentioned above is only one aspect. Here, the more important factor is "mobilizing the whole people, mobilizing the whole party, and the secretary taking action." Many county party secretaries in the Yuxi Special Zone personally went to the mountains and factories, and worked with the masses to explore mineral deposits, and adopted the method of relying on the masses to run industries to solve problems such as factory buildings, funds, and labor, which combined the leadership's thinking with the masses' wishes and became a huge construction force. It can be seen that the secretary's taking action and mobilizing the whole people are the keys to all problems. Without the secretary's taking action, it would become a leaderless group, at a loss; without mobilizing the whole people, relying only on a few people in the leading organs would not be able to play a good tune.
    We are very excited to introduce the Yuxi Prefectural Committee's leadership in local industry, supporting agricultural production, and striving to achieve the glorious prospect of agricultural modernization within five years. It seems that the speed of agricultural modernization depends to a large extent on the development speed of local industry. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important for the secretary to take the lead in grasping industry.

    人穷志不穷
    静宇
    近月来，地方工业大跃进的消息，像雪片一般纷纷飞来。云南玉溪专区计划在五年内基本上达到农田水利化、农业半机械化、农村电气化和肥料化学化，尤其令人振奋。
    五年以后就能做到农村现代化，这是一件了不起的事情。玉溪专区本来是个穷地方，在1953年以前，他们不仅要从外地买进一般工业品，连最简单的手工业品也要从外地运来：鸡毛掸子从广东运来，竹筷子从四川运来，扁担从贵州运来。他们有大量的皮子不能制革，却要卖出皮子买进皮革；他们有大量的木材不能制成用具，却要卖出木材买进水桶。他们的境况是这样的穷困，基础是这样的薄弱，而一旦办起了工业，发展速度却是那样的惊人，气魄又是那样的宏伟。难道这不是一件了不起的事吗？
    什么力量推动他们的地方工业如此迅速地发展呢？按照中共玉溪地委书记的说法，是“被迫上马”。这就是农业和手工业合作化以后，农村对地方工业的要求愈来愈多了，依靠外地供应的局面再也维持不下去了。也就是说，穷困的境况逼使他们向穷困战斗。所以，穷，并不是可怕的东西，穷也有好处：它激发人们的革命意志，促使人们奋勇上进，改变社会的穷面貌。俗语说，人穷志不穷，只要有志气，决心改造自然，开发富源，那么，我们就可以从无到有，从小到大，转穷变富，把不利因素转变为有利因素。
    当然，上面所说的穷，仅仅是一个方面。这里，更重要的因素还在于“全民动员，全党动员，书记动手”。玉溪专区的许多县委书记亲自上山下厂，同群众一起发掘矿藏，并且采取依靠群众办工业的办法，解决厂房、资金、劳动力等问题，这就使领导思想和群众愿望结合一起，成为一支巨大的建设力量。可见，书记动手、全民动员是一切问题的关键，没有书记动手，那就变成群龙无首，无所适从；没有全民动员，只靠领导机关几个人干，也就不能奏出很好的乐曲。
    我们以十分兴奋的心情介绍玉溪地委领导地方工业、支援农业生产，争取在五年内实现农业现代化的辉煌前景。看来，农业现代化的速度，有很大一部分要决定于地方工业的发展速度。所以，书记动手抓工业愈来愈显得重要了。
