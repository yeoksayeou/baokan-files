Marching Towards Rivers, Lakes, and Harbors

Jiangxi to Build Eighty Fish Farms This Year

(Our Dispatch) Jiangxi Province has transferred a large number of outstanding cadres to march towards the rivers, lakes, and harbor waters, developing these water surfaces and utilizing them to create wealth for the country.

Jiangxi Province has approximately over 20 million mu of river, lake, and harbor waters, of which about 4.5 million mu are suitable for developing freshwater fish farming. In 1958, Jiangxi Province plans to establish eighty state-owned fish farms in counties with abundant diked inner lakes and natural lakes and harbors, such as Jiujiang, Poyang, and Yugan, utilizing 1.15 million mu of water surface for fish farming. As of now, thirty-six have already been built. These farms generally do not build offices or dormitories, but try to rent civilian houses and live with the masses. The investment per mu of fish farming water surface also does not exceed four yuan. These farms will not only be self-sufficient by 1959 but will also have a small surplus; by 1962, they will be able to pay a large amount of funds to the state.

In order to ensure the completion of the 1958 fish farming plan and the early realization of the second and third Five-Year Plans, the province has transferred more than 2,000 cadres from last winter to the present, assigning them to various state-owned fish farms to directly participate in fish farming production labor.

    向江河湖港大进军
    江西将在今年兴建八十个养鱼场
    本报讯　江西省抽调了大批优秀干部向江河湖港水面大进军，开发水面、利用水面为国家创造财富。
    江西省的江河湖港的水面，约有二千多万亩，其中适合于发展淡水养鱼的水面约有四百五十万亩左右。1958年，江西省计划在围堤内湖和自然湖港水面多的九江、鄱阳、余干等县建立八十个国营养鱼场，利用放养鱼的水面，达到一百一十五万亩。到目前为止，已经建成了三十六个。这些场一般不兴建办公室、宿舍，尽量租用民房，与群众同住。每亩放养水面的投资也不超过四元。这些场，到1959年不但能自给，而且有少量的盈余；到1962年就可为国家缴纳大量资金。
    为了保证完成1958年养鱼计划和提前实现第二、三个五年规划，全省从去冬到现在，已经抽调干部二千多名，分派到各国营养鱼场，直接参加养鱼生产劳动。
