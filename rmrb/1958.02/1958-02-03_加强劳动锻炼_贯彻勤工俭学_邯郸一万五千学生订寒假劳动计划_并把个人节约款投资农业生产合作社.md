Strengthening Labor Training, Implementing Work-Study Program: 15,000 Students in Handan Order Winter Vacation Labor Plans and Invest Personal Savings in Agricultural Production Cooperatives

    (Our report) Handan area, Hebei province, more than 15,000 middle school students have responded to the call of the local student representative meeting and formulated individual plans for winter vacation labor training and work-study programs.

    There are a total of 153 secondary schools in the Handan area, with 31,000 students. As of January 24th, 57 secondary schools had 15,199 students who had formulated personal plans for labor training and frugal study for 1958 or the Spring Festival.

    When formulating individual plans for labor training and frugal study, in addition to actively participating in voluntary labor organized by the school and class, students also made plans for physical labor during vacations and holidays, striving to learn all agricultural production labor within three years. Each student plans to work a total of 30 to 80 workdays throughout the year. After the plans were formulated, the students actively took action. According to statistics from 57 schools in the Handan area in the three Sundays after the student representative meeting, 21,034 workdays had already been completed, averaging 1.1 workdays per student. Calculated according to the value of workdays in the Handan area this year, this is worth more than 25,000 yuan; calculated at 70 yuan per middle school student per year, this is enough for the tuition and living expenses of 360 students for one year.

    In the after-school voluntary labor during the semester, according to statistics from 17,579 students in 62 middle schools, more than 37.7 million jin of fertilizer were accumulated in one month, averaging 2,000 jin of fertilizer per student. In accumulating fertilizer, the students expressed their intention to dedicate their strength to the agricultural cooperatives, promote a great leap forward in production in 1958, and enable the motherland to catch up with or surpass Britain as soon as possible. Therefore, the students' enthusiasm was high. Day students carried manure baskets on the way to and from meals. Boarding students, in groups of classes or teams, cleaned schoolyards, streets, dug pit mud, swept slopes, and carried water during their daily free time.

    Students with more financial difficulties have greatly expanded the organization of work-study groups on the original basis. According to statistics from 57 secondary schools, 646 new groups were established in one month, with a total of 7,016 participants, accounting for 40% of the total number of students. These included barber groups and porter groups, which have actively started activities. Students in small towns also plan to collectively participate in labor on railway construction sites, construction sites, and agricultural cooperatives during the holidays for a period of time, determined to transform themselves into intellectuals who are both expert and red.

    In formulating plans, students also paid attention to saving, striving to be frugal students. According to statistics from 57 middle schools, 5,300 students originally planned to make 6,696 new cotton clothes for the Spring Festival this year, but now they have decided not to buy them and instead re-dye and wash their own old black jackets and black cotton pants, investing the savings in the cooperatives. In order to save more paper, the students of Cixian Shicunying Middle School took the initiative to turn over old books and bound 500 notebooks, saving 40 yuan.

    Since the Handan area student representative meeting, the schools have established a new atmosphere of labor, frugality, simplicity, and diligent study in one month. Students who used to receive more financial aid, wore more clothes, and spent more money now feel very ashamed, and simple students who were always looked down upon in the past have now become admired role models for all students.

　　加强劳动锻炼  贯彻勤工俭学  邯郸一万五千学生订寒假劳动计划  并把个人节约款投资农业生产合作社
    本报讯  河北邯郸地区，一万五千多名中学生，响应该地学生代表会议的号召订出寒假劳动锻炼和勤工俭学的个人计划。
    邯郸全区共有一百五十三处中等学校，三万一千学生，到1月24日止，五十七处中等学校，已有一万五千一百九十九名同学，订了1958年或春节的劳动锻炼勤俭求学的个人计划。
    在订个人劳动锻炼勤俭求学的计划时，学生们除积极参加学校和班里统一组织的义务劳动外，还订了假期假日的体力劳动，争取在三年内学会全部农业生产劳动。每个学生计划在全年共作工三十至八十个劳动日。计划制订后，广大学生已积极行动起来。据邯郸地区学生代表会议后的三个星期日，五十七处学校的统计，已作工二万一千零三十四个，平均每一个学生一点一个劳动日，按今年邯郸地区劳动日价值计算，可得二万五千多元；按每一个中学生每年七十元计算，够三百六十名学生一年的学费和生活费用。
    在学期的课余义务劳动中，据六十二处中学一万七千五百七十九名学生的统计，一个月的时间，就积肥三千七百七十多万斤，平均每一个学生积肥两千斤。在积肥中学生们表示，要把力量献给农业合作社，促进1958年生产大跃进，使祖国尽快的赶上或超过英国。因此，学生们的情绪高涨，走读同学在来回吃饭的中途路上扛起了粪箩头。住校生以班以小组为单位，在每天自由活动时间，清扫校院、街道、挖坑泥、扫圪?担水等。
    家庭困难较多的同学，在原来的基础上，又大量组织了勤工俭学小组。据五十七处中等学校的统计，一个月内新建立起六百四十六个小组，共有七千零十六人参加，占学生总数的40％。其中有理发小组、搬运小组，并且已积极开展了活动。小城镇的学生还计划假期到铁路工地、建筑工地、农业合作社去集体参加一个时间的劳动，决心改造自己，成为一个又专又红的知识分子。
    在订计划中学生们还注意了节约，争取做一个勤俭学生。据五十七处中学统计，有五千三百名学生原计划今年春节要作新棉衣六千六百九十六件，现在决定不买了，要把自己小黑袄小黑棉裤重新染洗一下，把节余下的钱向合作社投资。磁县时村营中学为了节约更多的纸张，学生们自己动手把旧书翻过来订了五百本笔记本节约四十元。
    自从邯郸地区学生代表会议以后，在一个月的时间里，各学校已树立了劳动、勤俭、朴实、努力学习的新气象。凡是过去助学金较多、穿衣多、花钱较多的学生，现在感觉很惭愧，过去一向被人看不起的朴实学生，现在成为全校学生钦佩的榜样。　（刘承珂）
