Continue to Break Through All Obstacles
People's Daily Commentator

Since the Soviet Union proposed convening a summit meeting of Eastern and Western countries, this proposal has become the common demand of peace-loving people all over the world, forming an irresistible pressure of public opinion. Under this pressure, British Prime Minister Macmillan, in his reply to Bulganin's letter of January 8, no longer insisted on holding a foreign ministers' meeting as a prerequisite for the summit meeting, and proposed another method, which is to conduct preparatory work through secret diplomatic exchanges. On the 11th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also changed his past tone at a press conference. He said that the United States does not consider the foreign ministers' meeting to be indispensable either. From this point of view, the first obstacle set by the United States to convene a summit meeting has been broken through by the waves of world peace. This is a welcome thing.

However, people cannot be too happy about this prematurely.

Dulles revealed at the same press conference the second obstacle set by the United States to convene a summit meeting, which is the so-called full preparation work to be done before the summit meeting is convened. Originally, as long as there is sincerity, preparing for the summit meeting is not a complicated matter. The Soviet Union has already proposed a method, that is, the summit meeting should adopt a phased and step-by-step approach to solving current international problems, and seek agreement on issues that have already matured first. If so, the procedural issues regarding the summit meeting are not a difficult problem. However, it seems that the United States is preparing to make a big deal out of this issue. Wasn't Dulles already saying: "I have not changed my opinion that it is 'almost' impossible to negotiate with them (referring to the Soviet Union)." "Almost" impossible to negotiate, then, Mr. Dulles, what are you saying about holding a summit meeting or doing full preparatory work? Regarding this point, Dulles's reason is: "It is not easy to find an agreement that is beneficial to both sides." He also said: "I am very suspicious that things will become easier as long as we are actually trying to reach an agreement that is beneficial to the United States." People can't help but ask, some of the peace proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, such as immediately stopping nuclear weapons tests, are beneficial to mankind and its future generations. More than 9,000 scientists around the world have issued urgent appeals to protect mankind from the harm of radioactive elements produced by testing nuclear bombs. Is it not beneficial to both sides and to all mankind to reach an agreement on the issue of stopping nuclear bomb tests? In many conversations, Khrushchev also mentioned that as long as an agreement is reached on issues such as stopping nuclear bomb tests, banning the use of atomic weapons and nuclear weapons, and removing all military bases abroad, the Soviet Union is willing to throw these weapons, including missiles, into the sea together with the United States, doesn't this include weapons that the United States cannot yet manufacture? What is the disadvantage to the United States in this way? Reaching an agreement on the peace proposals put forward by the Soviet Union will undoubtedly be a gospel for all mankind, and at the same time, it will not be detrimental to the United States. However, for the American monopoly capitalists who make a fortune from war, it is indeed detrimental. This is why Dulles said that it is "almost" impossible to negotiate with the Soviet Union.

From this, peace-loving people all over the world can see that the struggle to ease international tensions is a long-term and arduous struggle, and people must continue to struggle and break through all the obstacles set by Dulles and his ilk in order to promote the early convening of the high-level meeting.

    继续冲破一切障碍
    本报评论员
    从苏联提出召开东西方国家最高级会议的建议以来，这个主张已经成为全世界爱好和平人民的共同要求，形成了不可抗拒的舆论压力。在这种压力下，英国首相麦克米伦在答复布尔加宁1月8日的信中，已经不再坚持召开外长会议作为最高级会议的先决条件，提出还可以有另一种办法，就是通过秘密的外交来往，进行准备工作。11日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在记者招待会上，也改变了过去的腔调。他说美国也并不认为外长会议是必不可少的了。从这一点来看，美国为召开最高级会议所设置的第一道障碍，已经被全世界和平的浪潮所冲开。这是一件值得欢迎的事。
    不过，人们并不能就此过早的高兴起来。
    杜勒斯就在同一天的记者招待会上透露了美国为召开最高级会议设置的第二道障碍，也就是所谓要在召开最高级会议之前，作好充分的准备工作。本来，只要有诚意的话，为最高级会议作准备工作，并非很复杂的事。苏联早已经提出了办法，就是最高级会议对于当前的国际问题应当采取分阶段的、逐步解决的方法，先就已经成熟了的问题求得协议。果如此，关于最高级会议的程序问题，就不是什么难题了。可是，看来，美国在这个问题上，却准备大做文章。杜勒斯不是已经在说：“我并未改变我认为‘几乎’不可能同他们（指苏联）谈判的一种意见。”“几乎”不可能谈判，那么，请问杜勒斯先生，你所说的举行最高级会议也好，作好充分准备工作也好，岂不都成了废话？关于这一点，杜勒斯的理由是：“要找出对双方有利的协议是不容易的”。还说：“我很怀疑，只要我们实际上是在设法达成有利于美国的协议，事情会变得容易起来。”人们不禁要问，苏联提出的一些和平建议，比如立即停止核武器试验吧，是对人类及其后代大有利的事情。全世界九千多名科学家，为了人类免除试验核弹所产生的放射性原素的危害，曾发出迫切的呼吁。难道就停止试验核弹问题达成协议，不是有利于双方，也有利于全人类的事情吗？赫鲁晓夫在多次谈话中，还谈到，只要就停止试验核弹、禁止使用原子武器和核武器、撤除一切在国外的军事基地等问题达成协议，苏联愿意同美国一起把这些武器，包括导弹在内，都扔到海底里去，这不是包括了美国现在还不能制造出来的武器吗？这样，对美国又有什么不利呢？就苏联所提出来的和平建议达成协议，无疑的，将是全人类的福音，同时那也不会不利于美国。不过对于靠战争发财的美国垄断资本家们来说，倒确有不利之处。这就是杜勒斯为什么说“几乎”不可能同苏联谈判的道理。
    全世界爱好和平的人民由此可以看出，为缓和国际紧张局势的斗争是一场持久的艰巨的斗争，人们为了促成高级会议的早日召开，还必须继续奋斗，冲破杜勒斯之流所设置的一切障碍。
