    Notes
    While millions of unemployed Americans are unable to find jobs today, there is a type of person who doesn't have to worry about their job at all.
    James Gavin, who will resign from his post as head of the Army Research and Development Department at the end of March, is one such person. According to "U.S. News & World Report" on January 29, less than a month after the news of his decision to resign spread, two hundred companies scrambled to send him offers of employment.
    There is a reason why Gavin is so welcomed by American capitalists. During his time at the Pentagon, he spared no effort in demanding increased military spending. In his own words, "I have been begging for money for missiles and a space program."
    However, the fact that major corporations rushed to send job offers two months before the director left office is not simply a matter of gratitude. According to Gavin, he still has a batch of arms orders to be allocated. Therefore, the job offers sent by two hundred companies clearly also contain the meaning of currying favor with Gavin, hoping that he can "show mercy" by using his final authority.

### 争先恐后

    争先恐后
    在今天的美国，有好几百万失业者找不到职业的时候，却有一种人丝毫不用为自己的饭碗担心。
    将于3月底辞去陆军研究与发展局局长职务的詹姆斯·盖文就是这样的人。据“美国新闻与世界报道”1月29日说，当他决定辞职的消息传出后不到一个月，就有二百家企业争先恐后地向他发出了聘请书。
    盖文之所以受到美国大资本家这样欢迎，不是没有原因的。在他任职五角大楼期间，他曾不遗余力地要求增加军费，用他自己的话说，“我一直在为导弹和一项空间计划讨钱”。
    但是，各大企业在这位局长去职前两个月就抢着发聘书，并不单单是为了感恩图报。据盖文说，他手头还有一批军火订单有待分配。因此，二百家企业送出的聘书显然还有讨好盖文的意思，希望他能利用最后的职权“高抬贵手”。
