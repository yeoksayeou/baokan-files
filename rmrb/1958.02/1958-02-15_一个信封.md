    An Envelope
    Wang Jiuhua, Transportation Department Highway Science Research Institute
    This month's salary brought a half-envelope. After taking out the salary, I saw that this half-envelope was still quite sturdy, so I intentionally put it in the drawer to use for packing something. Today, when I was putting something in it, I saw that there were still words written inside. It was: a letter envelope from the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China Petroleum Corporation to the Longtan China Cement Factory in Nanjing. From the outside, this half-envelope had obviously been used twice. A strip of white paper was affixed to the front, from the Ministry of Building Materials Industry to the Materials Testing Institute of the Highway Bureau. Underneath the white paper strip, one could vaguely see the words "Nanjing Longtan China Cement Factory to the Directly Subordinate Enterprise Bureau of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry," which shows that this envelope has been circulated three times, traveling through the three major cities of Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Beijing, visiting four different units, and having been used four times.
    From such a half-envelope, I am reminded of the Party's correct policy of "building the country with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift." If every organ, every unit, and every group could conscientiously and fully utilize all materials in this way, how much expenditure would be saved for the country!

    一个信封
    交通部公路科学研究院　王久华
    本月发工薪，带来一个半截的信封。工薪拿出后，我看这个半截信封还很结实，就有意地将它放到抽屉里，以便装个什么东西用。今天当我往里面装东西时，看到里面还写着字。是：中国石油公司浙江省公司寄给南京龙潭中国水泥厂的信件封皮。从外面看来，这个半截信封显然是已经用过两次了。正面贴上了一张白纸条，是建筑材料工业部寄到公路局材料试验所的。在白纸条的底下隐隐约约地看到南京市龙潭中国水泥厂寄到建筑材料工业部直属企业管理局的字迹，这说明这个信封已周转过三次，旅行了杭州、南京、北京三个大城市，到过四个不同的单位，经过四次的使用了。
    从这样一个半截信封，使我联想到党的“勤俭建国，勤俭办一切事业”的正确方针。假如每个机关、每个单位、每个团体都能像这样兢兢业业地充分利用所有的物资的话，那不知要为国家节省多少开支啊！
