    Bees - Friends of Health
    Fang Zhu
    People all know that bees produce honey and wax, and bee pollination can increase crop yields, making beekeeping an excellent sideline for farmers. However, not everyone knows that bees' main contribution is to maintaining human health and helping doctors prevent and treat diseases. Bee products – honey, bee venom, royal jelly, propolis, beeswax, and pollen – each have certain medicinal properties and are popular natural medicines for preventing and treating many difficult-to-treat chronic diseases.
    Honey
    As early as two thousand years ago, our ancestors knew that honey was not only an excellent nourishing food but also an effective medicine. The "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic" says it "primarily treats evil qi in the heart and abdomen, calms the five internal organs and replenishes deficiencies, benefits qi and invigorates the middle, stops pain and detoxifies, removes all diseases, harmonizes all medicines, and prolonged use strengthens the will, lightens the body, prevents aging and extends life."
    Honey contains more than sixty kinds of inorganic and organic substances (glucose and fructose, which are essential for the nutrition of human organs, especially the myocardium, are the main components of honey; honey also contains mineral salts, organic acids, enzymes, vitamins, and other substances of great significance to body metabolism). However, the composition of honey varies depending on the type of nectar source collected by the bees. Therefore, Soviet scientists, following the theories of Michurin and Pavlov, experimented with artificial nectar sources to enable bees to produce honey containing special chemical and biological components according to people's intentions, and obtained many new varieties more suitable for medical and health care purposes.
    Taking honey internally can treat gastrointestinal diseases, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease, neurasthenia, tuberculosis, and other respiratory diseases; it can produce good results, especially for patients in the recovery period after surgery. Drinking a cup of honey water solution at night also has the effect of promoting sleep.
    Honey is particularly effective for gastrointestinal diseases. Soviet doctors, based on X-ray examinations, determined that only less than one-third of patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers treated with general drugs and diet therapy had their ulcers scarred over (healed); when treated with honey, the number of ulcers that scarred over accounted for more than half. In addition, taking honey internally or via enema has excellent effects on chronic constipation. Zhang Zhongjing, a famous doctor of the Han Dynasty in China, wrote in "Treatise on Febrile Diseases" about the "Honey Decoction Guidance Method" (refining honey into a colloid and inserting it into the rectum while hot) to treat constipation, which is equivalent to modern glycerol suppositories.
    Honey also has antiseptic and bactericidal effects. Applying honey can quickly heal lower leg ulcers, skin wounds, oral ulcers, thrush in children, frostbite, burns, and some skin diseases.
    Honey is more suitable for children and the elderly because it is sweet, nutritious, and easy to digest and absorb. Children who consume honey in their food gain weight faster, have higher hemoglobin levels, and have stronger resistance to disease; honey treatment has a very good effect on children with chorea, dysentery, colds, and exudative diathesis. Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, himself used honey as a nutrient and lived to be one hundred and seven years old. Soviet scholars investigated the living conditions of one hundred and thirty centenarians and found that 80% of them lived in bee-farming villages. Because they used honey as a nutrient, they achieved longevity. From many sources, honey can indeed be called a "longevity" medicine.
    In addition to the above methods, other applications of honey for treating diseases include: eye drops to treat corneal inflammation; spray inhalation to treat respiratory system diseases; use as an electro-iontophoresis agent to treat wounds and ulcers; and preparation into suppositories to treat gynecological trichomonas vaginitis. Honey is also an excellent flavoring agent in the preparation of medicines. It can also replace Vaseline to prepare medicated plasters, with better efficacy than Vaseline. The traditional Chinese medicine application of the "honey-refined pill method" (boiling honey to remove water and then mixing it with medicinal powder to make pills) is very reasonable. Honey pills can be stored for a long time without spoiling and are extremely easy to digest and absorb when taken.
    Bee Venom
    Many people are afraid of bees because their sting is very painful. Strangely, some people deliberately let bees sting them. What is the reason for this? It turns out that when a bee stings, it also injects a toxin into the skin. This is a therapeutic toxin that can treat many diseases.
    People have known for a long time that bee stings can treat diseases. In recent years, in many countries such as the Soviet Union, medical scientists, in cooperation with beekeepers, have conducted research on bee venom for disease treatment and have determined that it is a very valuable drug for treating rheumatism and other diseases.
    The first to discover that bee stings could treat rheumatism was Philipp Terc, a famous Viennese doctor. He was once a patient with rheumatism and was cured by accidental bee stings. Therefore, he paid attention to the medicinal properties of bee venom and published a scientific paper in 1888 on the cure of one hundred and seventy-three patients with rheumatism using bee stings. Since then, numerous observations by many medical scientists and beekeepers have confirmed that bee venom does have special effects on rheumatism, with no recurrence after cure and a preventive effect because beekeepers, due to bee stings, usually do not suffer from rheumatism.
    Bee venom is a very complex biological preparation with a strong bactericidal ability. It acts on the entire body through the nervous system, has a strengthening effect on body metabolism and heart activity, thereby improving the body's defense performance and promoting the recovery of normal activities in the diseased body. Therefore, bee venom can also achieve good results in the treatment of various neuralgia, gout, hypertension, bronchial asthma, hyperthyroidism, and some surgical, gynecological, ophthalmological, and dermatological diseases. In countries such as the Soviet Union, Germany, and Japan, various purified bee venom preparations have appeared.
    However, bee sting treatment should be carried out cautiously under the observation of a doctor. Patients with nephritis, diabetes, and those who are allergic to bee venom are prohibited from using bee venom for treatment.
    Royal Jelly
    Royal jelly, called "royal jelly" by beekeepers, is a translucent white milky liquid secreted by the hypopharyngeal glands of worker bees. Its value was discovered unintentionally by a Canadian beekeeper. More than thirty years ago, he found four "queen cells" (large honeycombs expanded by worker bees) in a queenless bee colony and casually removed the three excess ones. A hen pecked at these three "queen cells" and laid an unusually large egg the next day. This attracted the attention of scientists. Preliminary experiments have proved that royal jelly can enhance the physiological vitality of animals, stimulate reproductive activity, and prolong life; when used on humans, it can strengthen the body, improve disease resistance, and is an effective drug for treating malignant anemia, radiation sickness, diabetes, and female infertility. It is now known that royal jelly contains protein, fat, sugar, mineral salts, as well as rich complex vitamin B, which can promote body metabolism and has strong hematopoietic effects, vitamin E, which is necessary for animal reproduction, substances that have gonadotropic hormone effects and can stimulate the maturation of eggs in the reproductive organs of queen bees, and antibiotics that have antiseptic and bactericidal effects. Royal jelly may also contain special substances that have not yet been discovered that are precisely needed by the body and can prolong life, and scientists are still conducting in-depth research.
    Propolis, Beeswax, and Pollen
    When beekeepers want to open the hive to inspect the bee colony's work, they must first use a knife to open the inner hive cover and separate each honeycomb because these places are often adhered to by some yellowish-brown, sometimes greenish-blue viscous substances – propolis. Bees manufacture propolis to fill gaps in the hive and make the honeycomb clean and bright, but often exceeding their needs. Especially in Soviet and Italian bee hives, a lot of surplus propolis can often be scraped off. Propolis contains 50%-60% resin and tree fragrance, about 30% wax, 10% aromatic volatile oil, and some pollen and other inclusions. Research by Soviet scientists has proved that it has bactericidal effects on certain bacteria. Propolis can also treat various surgical diseases of livestock and poultry (various wounds, abscesses, mastitis, and necrobacillosis), with remarkable efficacy. In short, propolis is a good external medicine.
    Beeswax secreted by bees to build honeycombs has great industrial uses. In medicine, beeswax is a emollient drug, and external use can prevent skin cracking. Bleached beeswax is the base for various external ointments and can also be used to manufacture adhesive plasters, models, medicine caps, and the outer shell of Chinese medicine pills.
    Pollen collected by bees to feed larvae contains a wealth of various vitamins, and honey-soaked pollen is a folk medicine that Soviet people like to use.
    Finally, beekeeping itself is also a good way to improve human health: working in the beautiful nature, breathing fresh air filled with the fragrance of beeswax and hundreds of flowers, beekeepers are mostly disease-free all year round and are physically strong even at old age. Labor on the bee farm is a very effective "work therapy" for some weak and sick people, especially those with increased nerve excitability.

    蜜蜂—健康之友
    房柱
    人们都知道，蜜蜂会酿蜜造蜡，蜜蜂传粉能使农作物增产，养蜂是一项极好的农家副业。可是，并不是人人都知道：蜜蜂的主要贡献是维护人类健康，帮助医生防治疾病。蜜蜂的产品——蜂蜜、蜂毒、蜂乳、蜂胶、蜂蜡以及花粉等都各自具有一定的医疗性能，是防治许多难治慢性疾病的大众化天然药物。
    蜂蜜
    早在两千年以前，我们的祖先就知道蜂蜜不仅是一种出色的滋补性食品，而且是有效药物。“神农本草经”说它“主治心腹邪气，安五脏诸不足，益气补中，止痛解毒，除众病，和百药，久服强志轻身，不老延年”。
    蜂蜜含有六十种以上的无机和有机物质（人体各器官特别是心肌营养所必需的葡萄糖和果糖，正是蜂蜜的主要成份，蜂蜜还含有矿物盐、有机酸、酵素、维生素以及其它对机体代谢有重要意义的物质）。但是蜂蜜的成份因蜜蜂所采集的蜜源种类不同而有差异，于是苏联科学家遵循米丘林和巴甫洛夫两家学说，实验用人工蜜源使蜜蜂按人们的意图酿造出含有特殊化学和生物学成份的蜂蜜，获得了许多更适宜于医疗保健用的新品种。
    内服蜂蜜，能治疗胃肠道疾病、高血压病、动脉硬化、心脏病、肝脏病、肾脏病、神经衰弱、肺结核以及其他呼吸器官病；对于手术后恢复期的病人，尤其能够产生良好的效果。在晚上服一杯蜂蜜水溶液，还有促进睡眠的功效。
    蜂蜜对于胃肠道疾病的疗效特别显著。苏联医生根据X光检查确定，用一般药物及饮食疗法治疗胃及十二指肠溃疡病患者，只有不到三分之一的病人的溃疡结了疤（痊愈）；用蜂蜜治疗时，溃疡结疤者占半数以上。此外，将蜂蜜内服或灌肠，对慢性便秘有卓越疗效。我国汉代名医张仲景著“伤寒论”中有“蜜煎导法”（炼蜜成胶乘热纳入直肠中），治大便秘结，功用相当于现代的甘油栓。
    蜂蜜还有防腐杀菌作用。涂用蜂蜜能迅速治愈下腿溃疡、皮肤创伤、口腔溃疡、小儿鹅口疮、冻疮、烫伤和一些皮肤疾病。
    蜂蜜更适宜于儿童和老人食用，因为它甜味可口、营养丰富而易于消化吸收。食料中加用蜂蜜的儿童体重增长较快，血色素水平较高，对疾病抵抗力也强；对于舞蹈病、痢疾、感冒及渗出性素质的病孩用蜂蜜治疗有很好的疗效。西医学之父希波克拉底斯自己就以蜂蜜为营养品，活了一百零七岁。苏联学者曾调查一百三十位百岁老人的生活情形，结果发现有80％的老人都是生活在养蜜蜂的农庄里，正因为以蜂蜜为营养品，所以他们得到了长寿。从许多资料看来，蜂蜜确可称为“延年益寿”的良药。
    应用蜂蜜治病的方法除上述数种外，还有：滴眼可治角膜炎症；喷雾吸入能治呼吸系统病；治创伤溃疡可用作电离子透入；制成坐药能治妇科阴道滴虫病。在调制药物方面，蜂蜜也是极好的矫味剂。它还可以代替凡士林调制药羔，功效比凡士林还高。中医传统应用的“炼蜜为丸法”（熬蜜去水后捣和药粉为丸）是很合理的，蜜丸可久存不坏，服时极易消化吸收。
    蜂毒
    许多人怕蜜蜂，因为它螫人很痛。奇怪的是，还有些人故意让蜜蜂刺螫，这是什么道理呢？原来蜜蜂螫人的同时还向皮肤里注入一种毒素，这是一种治疗性毒素，能治疗许多疾病。
    人们很早就知道蜂螫能治疗疾病。近年来，在苏联等许多国家里，医学家配合养蜂家对蜂毒治病进行研究，确定它是治疗风湿等疾病的极有价值的药物。
    最先发现蜂螫能治风湿病的是维也纳著名医生菲里普·切尔奇，他曾经是风湿病患者，偶遇蜂螫而治愈，因此他才注意到蜂毒的医疗性能，在1888年曾发表用蜂螫治愈一百七十三例风湿病患者的科学论文。此后，许多医学家和养蜂家的无数次观察证实蜂毒对风湿病确有特效，治愈后永不再发，并有预防作用，因为养蜂人由于蜂螫照例不患风湿病。
    蜂毒是一种很复杂的生物制剂，有强大的杀菌能力，它通过神经系统作用于整个机体，对机体代谢和心脏活动具有强化作用，从而提高了机体防卫性能，促使患病机体恢复其正常活动。因此，蜂毒对各种神经痛、痛风、高血压、支气管哮喘、甲状腺机能亢进以及一些外科、妇科、眼科、皮肤科疾病的治疗亦能获得良好的疗效。在苏联、德国、日本等国家里已有提纯的各种蜂毒制剂出现。
    但是，用蜂螫治病应在医生观察下谨慎施行，肾脏炎、糖尿病等患者以及对蜂毒过敏的人，禁止用蜂毒来治疗。
    蜂乳
    蜂乳，养蜂人称它为“王浆”，是工蜂上颚腺所分泌出来的一种半透明的白色乳浆，它的利用价值是一位加拿大养蜂家无意中发现的。三十多年前，他在一个无王蜂群中发现了四个“王台”（工蜂扩建的大蜂房），就随手除去了多余的三个。母鸡啄食了这三个“王台”，第二天生了一个异乎常情的大鸡蛋。这就引起了科学家的注意。经初步实验证明，蜂乳能增进动物生理活力，刺激生殖活动，延长寿命；用于人体能增强体质，提高抗病力，是治疗恶性贫血、放射线病、糖尿病和妇女不孕症等疾病的有效药物。现在已知蜂乳中含有蛋白质、脂肪、醣、矿物盐，还有丰富的能促进机体代谢和具有强大造血作用的复合维生素乙，动物繁殖所必需的维生素戊，具有促性腺激素的作用，能刺激蜂王生殖器官中卵子成熟的物质以及有防腐杀菌作用的抗生素等。蜂乳中可能还含有尚未发现的正是机体所需要而能延长寿命的特殊物质，科学家们还正在深入研究。
    蜂胶、蜂蜡和花粉
    养蜂人如果要开箱检查蜂群工作，必先用刀启开里面的箱盖和分离每块巢脾，因为这些地方常被一些黄褐色、有时带青绿色彩的粘性物质——蜂胶所粘着。蜜蜂制造蜂胶用来塞补蜂箱缝隙并使蜂房清洁光亮，但常常超过需要。特别是苏联种和意大利种的蜂箱中，常能刮到很多过剩的蜂胶。蜂胶含有50％—60％树脂和树香，大约30％的蜡，10％的芳香性挥发油和一些花粉等夹杂物。苏联科学家的研究证明它对某些细菌有杀菌作用。蜂胶也能治疗农畜的多种外科疾病（各种创伤、脓疮、乳腺炎和坏死菌病等），疗效卓著。总之，蜂胶是一种良好的外用药。
    蜜蜂营造蜂房所分泌的蜂蜡在工业上用途很大。在医学上，蜂蜡是润肤药物，外用能防止皮肤破裂。漂白后的蜂蜡为各种外用药膏的基质，还可用作制造绊创羔、模型、药品封盖以及中药丸的外壳。
    蜜蜂为了喂饲幼虫而采集的花粉含有丰富的多种维生素，蜜浸花粉是苏联人民喜欢应用的民间药物。
    最后，养蜂工作本身也是一种增进人体健康的好方法：劳动在优美的大自然中，呼吸着充满了蜜蜡和百花芳香的新鲜空气，养蜂人大都长年无病，虽高龄而体力犹壮。蜂场上的劳动对于某些体弱病者，特别是一些神经兴奋性增高的人，是一种极有效益的“工作疗法”。
