The anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in industrial and mining enterprises in Liaoning Province has formed a surging tide, promoting a great leap forward in production and a great leap forward in ideology and work style. More than 1,000 units are now involved in this movement, posting more than 280,000 big-character posters and offering more than 1 million suggestions.

The development of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in Liaoning Province illustrates that if leading personnel actively ignite the fire to burn away the three bad work styles, take the lead in self-criticism, and guide the movement from exposing general losses and waste to deeply exposing the losses and waste caused by enterprise leaders, a vigorous new rectification upsurge can be formed, further combining anti-waste and anti-conservatism with improving enterprise leadership work style.

The Party Secretary and Director of the No. 1 Petroleum Factory took the lead in examining themselves at the beginning of the movement. They concentrated more than 80 cadres, including all factory section chiefs, workshop directors, and workshop Party branch secretaries, to dig into their thoughts face-to-face, uncover problems, and fiercely attack the three bad work styles. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to fire at the shortcomings of the leadership. Through attacks from above and below, 15,000 suggestions were put forward, clarifying the root causes of waste. The main reason for past waste was that the leadership's thinking was not comprehensive, focusing only on production workshops and not on auxiliary workshops. There was only general principled leadership and a lack of concrete and in-depth leadership. Regulations and systems that restricted the development of productive forces had not been changed for a long time. An old worker said: "I, an old man, can move a one-and-a-half-meter steel plate, but the security regulations stipulate that it must be lifted by twenty-three loading and unloading workers. Isn't this absurd?" Based on the revelations of the masses and cadres, the factory director and Party Secretary re-examined the leadership's thinking and formed four special groups to study improvement plans. Now, this factory has formed a rectification upsurge.

The leading personnel of the Dalian Shipyard took the lead in digging into their thoughts and examining waste. Within two or three days, they promoted the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement throughout the factory. In ten days, they put forward more than 20,000 suggestions. The responsible comrade of the CPC Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee believed that this experience of leadership taking the lead was very good. He immediately went to this factory to summarize the experience and convened a on-site meeting of factory leaders from the entire city at the Dalian Shipyard, introducing the successful experience of the Dalian Shipyard. At the same time, he criticized the shortcomings of some factory leaders who dared not take responsibility for their mistakes, promoting the development of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement throughout the city.

Through the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, further ways to run enterprises well were found. Since it was put into production, the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been unable to produce according to the variety plan for a long time, hindering the production of other factories and causing great losses. Last year, this factory produced more than 78,000 tons of unplanned steel that was not urgently needed by society, while the steel urgently needed by society could not be supplied. In this movement, the leading personnel examined that the main reason for not producing according to the variety plan in the past was the lack of an overall concept, only focusing on the completion of the factory's output value plan, regardless of the life or death of other factories. The workers also made self-criticisms. In the past, some workers, for personal gain, tried to be quick and convenient, exceeding quotas, and were unwilling to produce steel types that were technically difficult to master. The workers said: In the future, our production must start from the needs of the country and must never be for personal gain. Now, the production of unplanned steel in the entire factory has been reduced by more than half compared to the past.

In this anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, many industrial and mining enterprises are showing a thriving and vigorous atmosphere. Breaking through targets, revising plans, and leapfrogging again and again have become their common slogans. Some of the better-performing enterprises have paid attention to combining anti-waste, anti-conservatism, and formulating leap forward plans. More than a dozen local state-owned factories in Yingkou City have discovered production potential in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, proposing that this year's plan will be more than doubled compared to last year's actual level. The Dalian Steel Plant plans to produce more than 28,000 tons more steel and steel ingots this year than last year. After proposing to strive to produce 10 million tons of coal this year, the staff and workers of the Fuxin Mining Bureau proposed a plan to hand over 25 million yuan in profits this year. At first, some people in this mining bureau thought: the production of raw coal has lost money for years, and it would be good to plan to hand over 4.5 million yuan in profits this year. However, when the staff and workers revealed examples of waste, they discovered that the statement of "losing money for years" was a conservative and backward thought. The Ping'an Mine originally planned to lose 1.76 million yuan this year, but now it plans to hand over tens of millions of yuan in profits. The staff and workers of the entire mine put forward 20 measures to ensure more coal production and less waste. Because the recovery system was improved, more than 100 pit props and about 10 tons of coal dust can be recovered in one cycle. The workers said: This is the real beginning of running enterprises diligently and thriftily.

The current problem is that the leading personnel of some regions and enterprises do not sufficiently recognize the significance of this anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. They have not yet regarded anti-waste and anti-conservatism as the center of the current enterprise rectification, or they have placed anti-waste and anti-conservatism in opposition to other work, so that the movement is slow-moving. Some large state-owned enterprises in Shenyang and other places have hastily moved to a great debate after engaging in it for five or six days, or even three days. Secondly, some enterprise leaders do not take responsibility for their mistakes, or they do not do so deeply or thoroughly, only focusing on mobilizing workers to conduct self-criticism and mutual exposure, which increases the concerns of employees and affects the exposure of significant losses and waste caused by the subjectivism and bureaucracy of enterprise leaders. This phenomenon must be corrected so that the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement can be carried out more healthily and fully.

    辽宁反浪费反保守运动大步向前
    促进生产思想双跃进
    少数企业慢慢腾腾领导引火烧身决心不大
    本报讯　辽宁省工矿企业反浪费反保守运动，已经形成一股推动生产大跃进、思想作风大跃进的澎湃浪潮。现在已有一千多个单位卷进这个运动，共贴出二十八万多张大字报，提出一百多万条意见。
      辽宁省反浪费反保守运动发展的情况说明：如果领导人员积极引火烧掉自己身上的三大坏主义，带头自我揭发缺点，引导运动由揭发一般性的损失浪费，转向深入地揭发企业领导人员所造成的损失浪费，就能形成生气蓬勃的新的整改高潮，并进一步把反浪费反保守和改进企业领导作风结合起来。
    石油一厂党委书记和厂长在运动一开始，就带头检查自己，并且把全厂科长、车间主任、车间党支部书记以上八十多名干部集中在一起，面对面地挖思想，揭开盖子，猛攻三大坏主义；同时又发动群众向领导上的缺点开火。经过上下夹攻，提出一万五千条意见，弄清了造成浪费的根源。过去所以会发生浪费现象，主要是因为领导思想不全面，只抓生产车间，而不抓辅助车间；只有一般的原则领导，缺少具体的深入领导；对于一些束缚生产力发展的规章制度，长期没有加以改变。有个老工人说：“一公尺半长的钢板，我这个老头子也能搬得动；但是保安规程却规定：非要二十三名装卸工人来抬不可。这不是奇闻吗？”厂长、党委书记根据群众和干部的揭露，又检查了领导思想，并且还组成了四个专门小组，来研究改进的方案。现在这个厂已经形成整改高潮。
    大连造船厂领导人员带头挖思想，检查浪费，在两、三天之内就把全厂反浪费反保守运动推动起来，十天功夫就提出两万多条意见。中共旅大市委负责同志认为这种领导带头的经验很好，马上亲自到这个工厂总结经验，并且召集全市工厂负责人来到大连造船厂，举行现场会议，介绍大连造船厂的成功经验，同时也批评有些工厂领导上不敢引火烧身的缺点，推动了全市反浪费反保守运动的开展。
    通过反浪费反保守运动，进一步找到办好企业的门路。鞍钢第二炼钢厂从投入生产以来，长期不能按品种计划进行生产，妨碍其他工厂的生产，造成很大损失。这个厂去年一年生产的非计划的、不是社会迫切需要的钢种，就有七万八千多吨；而社会迫切需要的钢种，又供应不上。在这次运动中，领导人员检查了过去所以不按品种计划生产，主要是因为缺乏整体观念，只顾本厂产值计划的完成，不顾别的工厂死活。工人们也作了检查，过去有些工人为了个人利益，尽量图快图方便、超定额，不愿生产技术上难以掌握的钢种。工人们说：咱们今后生产，一定要从国家需要出发，决不能为个人利益打算。现在全厂生产的非计划的钢，已比过去减少一半以上。
    许多工矿企业在这次反浪费反保守运动中，呈现出欣欣向荣的蓬勃朝气。突破指标，修改计划，跃进再跃进，成了他们共同的口号。一些做得较好的企业，都注意把反浪费、反保守和制订跃进计划结合起来。营口市十多个地方国营工厂在反浪费、反保守当中，找出了生产潜力，提出今年计划要比去年实际水平提高一倍以上。大连钢厂今年计划生产的钢材和钢锭要比去年多两万八千多吨。阜新矿务局职工在提出今年争取产煤一千万吨以后，又提出今年上缴利润二千五百万元的计划。起初这个矿务局有些人还认为：原煤生产历年赔钱，今年计划上缴利润四百五十万元，那就算不错了。但是，职工们一揭开浪费事例，就发现“历年赔钱”的说法是一种保守落后思想。平安矿原计划今年亏本一百七十六万元，现在却计划上缴利润好几十万元。全矿职工提出了二十项措施，保证多产煤，少浪费，因为改进了回收制度，一个循环就可以多回收坑木一百多根，多回收浮煤十吨左右。工人们说：这才是真正勤俭办企业的开端。
    当前的问题，首先是有些地区和企业的领导人员对这次反浪费反保守运动的意义认识不足，他们还没有把反浪费反保守当成当前企业整风的中心，或把反浪费反保守与其他工作对立起来，以致动得慢慢腾腾，有些企业匆匆动了一下就草率收兵。沈阳等地有些较大的国营企业，有的搞了五、六天甚至三天，就草草转入大辩论了。其次，有些企业领导不引火烧身，或烧也不烧深烧透，只是着重去发动工人进行自我检查和互相揭发，这就增加了职工的顾虑，而且影响对企业领导人员主观主义、官僚主义所造成的重大损失浪费的揭发。必须纠正这种现象，反浪费反保守运动才能更健康更饱满地开展起来。
