Catching up with Agricultural Output Value and Promoting Agricultural Development

Hunan's Local Industry to Grow More Than Sevenfold in Five Years

(Our Newspaper’s dispatch) The entire Party runs industry, every county has industry, every township has industry, and every commune has industry, so that the total output value of local industry in Hunan Province will increase by more than seven times in five years, reaching 6 billion yuan, which is equal to the total value of agricultural production. This is the grand plan for developing local industry put forward at the agricultural production conference recently convened by the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, local industry in Hunan Province made considerable progress. The total output value of local industry increased by 1.99 times compared with 1952, and the proportion of the total industrial output value of the province, including state-owned, local state-owned, and handicrafts, in the total industrial and agricultural output value reached 36.61%. However, the development of local industry still cannot keep up with the needs of agriculture. Therefore, this provincial agricultural production conference, attended by the Party secretaries of various counties, proposed that the province's local industry should leap forward at a high speed of 40%, 50%, and 60% annually in the next five years.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, Hunan Province will build dozens of industrial enterprises above the quota. Counties, townships, and agricultural cooperatives will develop a number of small coal mines, small fertilizer plants, small machinery plants, and small processing plants in a planned manner and in accordance with local conditions. All localities will absorb and develop the experience of Qin County, Shanxi Province, in running local industries, so as to develop local industries as soon as possible in order to meet the needs of agricultural mechanization and agricultural technological innovation.

In order to accelerate the development of local industry, Hunan Province will adopt the method of "snowballing" and "scattered troops advancing," using large enterprises to bring along small ones, upgrading handicraft cooperatives, and cities supporting rural areas, to fully utilize the existing industrial base. At the same time, it is necessary to rely on the local masses to solve the financial problems of developing local industry.

At present, all localities have begun to further revise this year's industrial production leap forward plan in accordance with this spirit. (Qiu Fangruo)

    赶上农业产值　促进农业发展
    湖南地方工业五年将增长七倍多
    本报讯　全党办工业，县县有工业、乡乡有工业、社社有工业，使湖南的地方工业总产值在五年内增长七倍多，达到六十亿元，同农业生产总值相等。——这是不久以前中共湖南省委召开的农业生产会议上提出的发展地方工业的宏伟计划。
    湖南省地方工业在第一个五年计划期间有了相当大的发展。地方工业总产值比1952年增长一点九九倍，全省包括国营、地方国营、手工业在内的工业总产值在工农业总产值中的比重达到36.61％。但是地方工业的发展还赶不上农业的需要。因此，这次有各县县委书记参加的全省农业生产会议，提出全省地方工业今后五年内每年要以递增40％、50％、60％的高速度向前跃进。
    第二个五年计划期间，湖南省将兴建几十个限额以上的工业企业。各县各乡和农业社，将有计划地、因地制宜地发展一批小煤矿、小型肥料厂、小型机械厂和小型加工厂。各地将吸取和发展山西沁县办地方工业的经验，使地方工业尽快地发展起来，以便满足农业机械化和农业技术革新的需要。
    为了加速发展地方工业，湖南省将采取“滚雪球”、“散兵前进”的方式，用大带小、手工业社升级、城市支援农村的办法，充分运用现有工业基础，同时要依靠当地群众解决发展地方工业的资金问题。
    目前，各地已经开始根据这一精神，进一步修订今年的工业生产跃进规划。　　　　（丘方若）
