We fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang. The ten measures concerning culture and education proposed by Vice Premier Bo Yibo in his report are extremely important and timely for further improving China's education system and combining mental and physical labor. We listened to Director Wu Yuzhang's report with great excitement. After the implementation of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, it will greatly accelerate the improvement of the national workers' and peasants' cultural level and reduce the difficulty of the next generation in learning culture.

If intellectuals are not thoroughly reformed according to socialist requirements, they will be incompatible with the new society, which will lead to sharp contradictions between the foundation and the superstructure.

Since liberation, under the strong leadership of the Party and the government, China's higher education has made astonishing achievements, greatly changing the face of higher education in old China. Eight years later, there are already hundreds of thousands of university graduates active on all fronts of the motherland's economy and culture. The various colleges and universities themselves have also undergone great improvements in scientific level and political quality due to departmental adjustments and various ideological remolding movements. However, compared with the vigorous and great socialist construction of our country, we feel that there are still many serious shortcomings in ourselves.

Our country was originally a culturally backward and economically poor country. This was the result of long-term feudal bureaucratic reactionary rule. In terms of science and culture, it is very inconsistent with our great emerging country. Therefore, in the early days of liberation, although the economy was very difficult, our Party still used great efforts to build our universities and cherished and cared for all intellectuals in every possible way. This is what all university teachers and students have personally experienced.

Our country's transformation from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society to a socialist society is an earth-shaking revolution, a change of two completely different social systems, a thorough change of productive forces and production relations, and a thorough change of the social and economic foundation. Our schools are precisely in this great era of change. In the past, our universities served capitalist society, and from school organization to personal work style and ideology, they all belonged to the category of capitalism. But now we want to serve socialist society. If our schools and all intellectuals are not thoroughly reformed according to the requirements of socialism, they will be incompatible with the new society, and there will be sharp contradictions between the foundation and the superstructure.

The improvement of political ideology is of paramount importance to a people's teacher, but some university teachers are not interested in politics and only teach books but not people. And their outlook on life still bears the brand of the bourgeoisie, and their scientific and artistic thoughts also contain bourgeois idealist elements in many aspects. What kind of teachers there are, what kind of students will be cultivated. If the teachers' ideology is not transformed, socialist schools will also cultivate bourgeois students.

Among the right-wing ringleaders who frantically attacked the Party during the Great Leap Forward last year, university teachers accounted for a large proportion. This cannot but shock us. These people are all enemies of socialism hidden in universities. We must resolutely expose and criticize them so that they cannot deceive the people and endanger our schools and country.

We cannot deny that all teachers and students have received eight years of socialist education, and generally there has been progress in ideology, and they have done a lot of work for China's socialist construction, and some have become Communist Party members or Communist Youth League members. However, whether we are teachers or students, we have lived in the old society for more than ten to dozens of years, and we have only lived in the new society for eight years. In terms of living habits and ideological feelings, we are all inextricably linked to the old society. The transformation of a person from the bourgeois position to the proletarian position is also a thorough change in earth-shaking ideological feelings, a change in the entire outlook on life. Old ideological feelings are deeply rooted. Often it seems that we have recognized them theoretically, but we have not changed in action; it seems that we have solved them ideologically, but emotionally it is another matter. Why is this so? The fundamental reason is that we are seriously divorced from politics and divorced from reality in our daily lives; we have not fundamentally realized that the improvement of political ideology is a matter of paramount importance for a person who is a people's teacher. People's teachers are the soul engineers of mankind. Our task is to cultivate socialist new generations of scientists, artists, engineers, doctors, and teachers. Although there are people in universities who are worthy of being true socialist people's teachers, there are also some teachers who think that they are scientists and artists, not politicians, and are not interested in politics. They believe that their only responsibility is scientific research and to impart their expertise to students; but they have never realized that in the depths of their souls, there is still a kingdom of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, and not only does their outlook on life still bear a deep mark of the bourgeoisie, but their scientific and artistic thoughts also contain bourgeois idealist elements in many aspects.

In the past, teachers in various colleges and universities had the phenomenon of teaching books but not people, believing that political ideology was the responsibility of the Party and the administration and had nothing to do with professional teachers. In fact, the professional teachers had the deepest impact on the students. What kind of teachers there are, what kind of students there are; thus socialist universities can also cultivate bourgeois students.

Serious individualistic bourgeois thought is quite prevalent in universities. Some people give up their work and devote themselves to the title of associate doctorate; students are keen on personal fame; scientific research also does not communicate with each other. Therefore, there is still a serious struggle between two roads in universities.

Although there is no shortage of experts in universities who serve socialism seriously, serious individualistic bourgeois thought is also quite prevalent. Everything starts from the individual, emphasizing personal interests, personal future, and personal benefits; our country, in order to improve the level of science and cultivate more scientific talents, buys instruments and invites experts at any cost, but some teachers and students regard these as a kind of right that should be obtained to satisfy personal desires, and the state must meet personal requirements in all aspects. If it is slightly unable to meet them, it must be bureaucratic leadership. The state encourages teachers to study, encourages scientific research, and thus some people give up their work and devote themselves to the academic title of associate doctorate. And a considerable number of students are keen on personal fame and career, and do not care about anything else, specializing in their own business. If they achieve something, they become arrogant and complacent, thinking that they are the best in the world.

In scientific research, in universities, although generally they can give play to collective strength and improve together, there are also many people who, due to individualistic thinking, still adopt a go-it-alone approach in scientific research, not communicating with each other, unable to achieve mutual assistance and mutual learning; even worse, they hypocritically compliment each other in person, but do not buy each other's accounts and attack each other behind their backs. Some people also conduct research for the sake of scientific research and for the sake of academics, without considering the actual needs of socialist construction. In the field of literature and art, they one-sidedly emphasize closed-door improvement and neglect the popularization of the masses.

Our Party values intellectuals, but some intellectuals think they are superior and look down on the working people, even those cadres from the working people. In fact, how much knowledge do they have? These people lack at least two kinds of knowledge, first, they lack political knowledge, and second, they lack knowledge of labor production; they do not know that in a socialist country, without the Party and without the working people, they will have nothing to rely on.

Although the lives of our working people have greatly improved since liberation, the general level is still very low; in contrast, in our universities, from basic construction to the expenses of teaching and scientific research, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste is quite serious; they arbitrarily squander the wealth produced by the working people without feeling heartache.

Judging from the above phenomena, there is still a serious struggle between two roads in our universities. Bourgeois thought still has a certain market in our universities. Therefore, our Party has to loudly call on us to wake up from our dreams and wage a life-or-death struggle against our own bourgeois thoughts.

Education in the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement has enabled everyone to have the courage and strength to expose and criticize all the bourgeois thoughts that remain in them, and a new atmosphere has emerged in universities.

The Great Leap Forward and the anti-rightist struggle have already taught us the first lesson, and our understanding has been generally improved. Then there was a comprehensive rectification movement. Through the Great Leap Forward, great debates, posting big-character posters, holding debate meetings, etc., we all understood more principles, and thus everyone had the courage and strength to expose and criticize all the bourgeois thoughts that remained in them.

Just as our country victoriously overfulfilled the first five-year plan, our Party issued a resounding call to 600 million people to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little more, and to complete the provisions of the revised draft of the agricultural development program ahead of schedule in agriculture. The people of the whole country are responding to the Party's call, comparing with the advanced, comparing with the enthusiasm, setting off a high tide of production, and with heroic feelings, riding the wind and waves, and striding forward to the bright future of our motherland.

Colleges and universities across the country are also setting off a high tide of comprehensive rectification with the momentum of riding the wind and waves. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, universities in Shanghai are responding to the spirit of the Party Central Committee's specific instructions on running schools diligently and thriftily, cultivating intellectuals who are both red and expert, labor training, opening to workers and peasants, etc. They have held various meetings, conducted heated debates, and conducted earnest inspections, showing a new atmosphere. In terms of running schools diligently and thriftily, the budget for 1958 saved 5 million yuan. Teachers and staff of various schools went to the countryside in batches to participate in long-term physical labor in the suburbs, not only gaining labor training themselves, but also bringing culture to the countryside, making rural cultural life more active. Various schools are vying to make plans to increase the proportion of teachers who are leftists, increase the proportion of students from workers and peasants, and run correspondence schools, night schools, university preparatory classes, cadre training classes, etc. to facilitate the training of worker-peasant cadres and students. Specific arrangements have been made in the plans for strengthening students' political and ideological education, labor training, connecting with reality, strengthening teachers' comprehensive responsibility for students, and improving teaching quality. And they have successively formulated five-year scientific research plans, setting off a high tide of scientific research and literary and artistic creation. All this is an exciting new atmosphere in the current rectification movement.

The country needs hundreds of thousands and millions of experts who are both red and expert. Teachers have a great responsibility, but first they must transform themselves into experts of the working class who are both red and expert. Therefore, they must be determined to abandon all the big and small burdens brought by the old society and train themselves to become members of the working class.

Our great motherland will become one of the most advanced socialist countries in the world in the future. The number of experts who are both red and expert is not hundreds of thousands, but millions. Therefore, our responsibility is great and our task is glorious; but first we must transform ourselves into experts of the working class who are truly both red and expert. Therefore, the most important thing at present is to face up to the struggle between the two roads that exist in our higher education, face up to all the bourgeois individualistic thoughts that each of us brings from the old society, and use the method of great leaping forward, great debate, and great debate, through serious, earnest, profound, meticulous and realistic criticism and inspection, to thoroughly complete the comprehensive rectification movement that is currently underway; be determined to abandon all the big and small burdens brought by the old society, be determined to go to practical labor to train ourselves to become members of the working class, be in high spirits, full of confidence, and under the strong leadership of the Party, march in orderly steps with the workers and peasants towards the great tomorrow of the motherland.

    向自己的资产阶级思想作生死斗争
    陈建功　叶企孙　王淑贞　王菊生　孟宪承　贺绿汀代表谈高等学校教师的思想改造的重要性
    我们完全同意李先念、薄一波两位副总理及吴玉章主任的报告，薄一波副总理在报告中所提出的关于文化教育的十项措施，对进一步改进我国教育制度，使脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合是一个极其重要而适时的措施。我们以非常兴奋的心情听取吴玉章主任的报告，汉语拼音方案实行以后，将会大大加速提高全国工农文化水平，减少后一代学习文化的困难。
    知识分子不根据社会主义要求加以彻底改造，就会与新社会格格不入，就会产生基础与上层建筑之间尖锐的矛盾。
    我国高等教育，解放以来，在党与政府坚强领导下，已经有了惊人的成就，大大改变了旧中国高等教育的面目，八年后的今天，已经有数十万大学毕业生，活跃在祖国经济文化各个战线上。各高等院校本身也由于经过院系调整与历次的各种思想改造运动，无论在科学水平、政治质量上都有很大的提高。但是与目前我国蓬蓬勃勃的伟大的社会主义建设比较起来，我们感到自身还存在着许多严重的缺点。
    我国原来是一个文化落后，经济穷困的国家，这是过去长期封建官僚反动统治的结果，在科学文化方面与我们这个伟大的新兴的国家很不相称；因之，在解放初期，虽然经济十分困难，我们的党还是以很大的力量来建设我们的高等学校，并且对一切知识分子都重视爱护无微不至；这是我们全体高等学校教师学生都亲身体会到的。
    我们国家从过去的半封建半殖民地的社会变成社会主义社会，是一个天翻地复的革命，是两种完全不相同的社会制度的改变，是生产力与生产关系的彻底改变，是社会经济基础的彻底改变。我们的学校正是处在这个伟大的变革时代。从前我们的大学是为资本主义社会服务的，从学校组织到个人的工作作风、思想方法都属于资本主义的范畴。但是我们现在要为社会主义社会服务了，我们的学校和所有的知识分子如果不根据社会主义的要求加以彻底改造的话，就会与新社会格格不入，就会产生基础与上层建筑之间尖锐的矛盾。
    政治思想的提高对于一个人民教师是头等重要的事，但有些大学教师却对政治没有兴趣，只教书不教人。而他们的人生观尚带有资产阶级的烙印，科学文艺思想也在许多方面带有资产阶级唯心主义成分。有怎样的老师就会培养出怎样的学生，如果不改造教师的思想，社会主义的学校也会培养出资产阶级的学生。
    在去年大鸣大放期间猖狂向党进攻的右派头子中，高等学校教师占很大的比例，这不能不使我们触目惊心，这些人都是隐藏在高等学校内的社会主义的敌人，我们不能不坚决予以揭发批判，使他们无法去欺骗人民，危害我们的学校与国家。
    我们不能否认，所有的教师、学生都已经受过八年的社会主义的教育了，一般在思想上都有进步，为我国社会主义建设，作了很多的工作，并且有些已经成为共产党员或共青团员了。但是，我们无论是教师、学生，生活在旧社会是十余年到数十年，生活在新社会仅仅八年，无论在生活习惯、思想感情各个方面，都与旧社会有千丝万缕的连系；一个人从资产阶级的立场变到无产阶级的立场，也是天翻地复的思想感情的彻底改变，是整个人生观的改变。旧的思想感情是根深蒂固的，往往似乎理论上认识了，行动上没有改变；思想上似乎已经解决了，感情上又是另一回事。为什么是这样呢？根本原因是我们平日生活中严重脱离政治脱离实际；根本没有认识到政治思想的提高对于一个作为人民教师的人是一件头等重要的事情。人民教师是人类的灵魂工程师，我们的任务是要培养社会主义的新的一代的科学家、文艺家、工程师、医师、教师。在高等学校里虽然也有不愧为真正的社会主义的人民教师的人，但是也有一些教师认为自己是科学家、文艺家，不是政治家，对政治没有兴趣，认为自己唯一的责任是科学研究，把自己的所长传授给学生；但是自己从来就没有意识到，自己的灵魂深处还依旧是资产阶级、小资产阶级的王国，不但自己的人生观尚带有深刻的资产阶级的烙印，自己的科学文艺思想也在许多方面带有资产阶级唯心主义的成份。
    各高等学校教师过去存在教书不教人的现象，认为政治思想是党与行政的责任，与专业教师无关，其实给学生影响最深的就是专业教师，有怎样的老师就有怎样的学生；于是社会主义的高等学校也可以培养出资产阶级的学生来。
    在高等学校里严重的个人主义的资产阶级思想相当普遍存在。一部分人放弃工作，专门为副博士的头衔而奋斗；学生则热中于个人成名；科学研究也互不通声气。因此在高等学校里还存在着严重的两条道路的斗争。
    虽然在高等学校里不乏严肃地为社会主义服务的专家，但是严重的个人主义的资产阶级思想也相当普遍地存在。一切从个人出发，强调个人的兴趣，个人的前途，个人的利益；我们国家为了提高科学水平，培养更多的科学人材，买仪器请专家，不惜任何代价，但是部分教师、学生却把这些作为满足个人欲望的应得的一种权利，国家必须在一切方面满足个人的要求，稍一不能满足就一定是领导上官僚主义。国家鼓励教师进修，鼓励科学研究，于是一部分人就放弃自己应作的工作专门为副博士的学衔而奋斗。而相当多的学生则热中于个人的成名、成家，其他甚么都不管，专门钻研自己的业务，略有所成，就骄傲自满，目空一切，老子天下第一。
    在科学研究方面，在高等学校里，虽然一般都能发挥集体力量共同提高，但是也有不少的人，由于个人主义思想，在科学研究方面依旧采取单干形式，互相不通声气，不能做到互相帮助互相学习；更恶劣的甚至当面虚伪地互相恭维，背地里则互不卖账、互相攻击。也有的为科学研究而研究，为学术而学术，不考虑社会主义建设实际需要，在文艺方面则片面地强调关门提高，忽视群众普及工作。
    我们党重视知识分子，而有些知识分子却自以为高人一等，看不起劳动人民，甚至连从劳动人民出身的干部都看不起，其实自己到底有多少知识呢！这种人起码缺少两种知识，第一缺少政治知识，第二缺少劳动生产知识；不知道在社会主义国家里，离开了党，离开了劳动人民就会无所依靠。
    我们的劳动人民，解放以来生活虽然大大的改善了，但是一般水平还是很低的；反观我们的高等学校里，从基本建设到有关教学及科学研究各方面的设备开支，铺张浪费的现象是相当严重的；把劳动人民生产出来的财富，任意挥霍，并不感到心痛。
    从以上这些现象看来，我们高等学校里还存在着严重的两条道路的斗争。资产阶级思想在我们高等学校里尚有一定的市场。因此我们的党不得不向我们大声疾呼，要我们从睡梦中清醒过来，向我们自身所存在的资产阶级思想作生死的斗争。
    在反右派斗争和整风运动中受到教育，使每个人有勇气有力量揭发和批判自己残存的一切资产阶级思想，高等学校里出现新气象。
    在大鸣大放反右派斗争中已经给我们上了第一课，我们的认识已经普遍提高了，接着又是全面的整改运动，通过大鸣大放，大争大辩，贴大字报，开辩论会等等办法，使我们大家明白了更多的道理，因而每个人有勇气有力量去揭发去批判自己所残存的一切资产阶级思想。
    正当我国胜利地超额完成第一个五年计划的时候，我们党向六亿人民发出了响亮的号召，要在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国，在农业方面提前完成农业发展纲要修正草案的规定。全国人民正在响应党的号召，比先进，比干劲，掀起了生产的高潮，以英勇豪迈的心情，乘风破浪，向我们祖国美好的将来，大踏步前进。
    全国高等院校也正以乘风破浪之势掀起了全面整改的高潮，上海市各高等学校，在上海市委领导下，响应党中央关于勤俭办学、培养又红又专的知识分子、劳动锻炼、向工农开门等等方面具体指示的精神，召开各种会议，进行热烈的争论，切实的检查，出现了一片新气象，在勤俭办学方面，一九五八年预算节约出五百万元，各校教职员分批下乡到郊区参加长期体力劳动，不但自己得到了劳动锻炼，而且把文化带下了乡，使农村文化生活更加活跃。各校都竞相订计划提高教师左派比例，提高学生工农成份的比例，举办函授学校、业余学校、大学预备班、干部进修班等等以便利工农干部学生进修。对加强学生政治思想教育、劳动锻炼、联系实际、加强教师对学生全面负责提高教学质量等等方面都在计划分别作出具体安排。并且纷纷拟订五年科学研究规划，掀起了科学研究和文艺创作的热潮，这一切都是在正在整改运动中令人兴奋的新气象。
    国家需要几十万、几百万又红又专的专家，教师的责任是重大的，但首先必须把自己改造成为工人阶级的又红又专的专家，因此，必须下决心丢掉旧社会带来的一切大小包袱，把自己锻炼成工人阶级队伍中的一员。
    我们伟大的祖国将来要成为世界上最先进的社会主义国家之一，所需要的又红又专的专家，不是几十万，而是几百万，因此我们的责任是重大的，任务是光荣的；但是首先必须把我们自己改造好，成为真正工人阶级的又红又专的专家。因之，目前头等重要的事情，就是要正视我们高等教育中所存在的两条道路的斗争，正视我们每一个人从旧社会带来的一切资产阶级个人主义的思想，用大鸣大放大争大辩的办法，通过严肃认真深刻细致而又实事求是的批判检查，彻底完成目前正在进行的全面整风运动；下决心丢掉旧社会带来的一切大小包袱，下决心到实际劳动中去锻炼自己成为工人阶级队伍中的一员，精神百倍，充满信心，在党的坚强的领导下，和工人农民一道，迈开整齐的步伐，奔向祖国伟大的明天。
