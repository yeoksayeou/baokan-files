    Overthrow Foreign Stereotypes
    Speech by Representative Shu Sheyu
    Last year, a group of rightists emerged among writers. Since it was a group, it was not a small number; the higher the proportion, the less glorious it is, please forgive me for not listing the specific numbers!
    What is worth mentioning is that we did not let go of a single rightist. The struggle was very fierce. The criticism meetings against Ding Ling and others alone were held more than twenty-seven times. The rightists bowed their heads, and all the writers were educated and raised their awareness.
    At the criticism meetings, we not only exposed the ugly deeds of the rightists and their groups, but also initially criticized their poisonous works and "literary theories." This year, we will conduct this criticism more deeply, hoping that the broad readership will join us in distinguishing between flowers and weeds, jointly defending socialism; and hoping to enrich ourselves with Marxist literary theory and the literary and artistic direction indicated by Chairman Mao, to strike and eliminate revisionism and all other demons and monsters. From the latest issue of "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette), we can see the beginning of this movement. Continued criticism, further criticism, is one of the important tasks of literary publications this year.
    Strive for a High Tide in Literary Creation
    After the victory in repelling the rightists, writers strived to go to the countryside and mountains, to factories and to the army. The writers' associations everywhere are no longer writers' homes, but are replaced by the countryside, the factories, and the army. Only in these new homes all over the country can writers be transformed ideologically faster and better, obtain sufficient materials and skills to reflect the lives of the people, and obtain the enthusiasm and determination to create for the people. The vast majority of writers regard this as the greatest happiness, and unanimously appreciate the leadership and help of the Party. Yes, the writers who went down this time have received meticulous care and help from the Party and the government, and the writers' association has formulated specific measures to regularly support members who have settled down in various places, such as providing them with new books and periodicals at any time, and solving difficulties in their families, etc.
    I believe that in three to five years, we will be able to produce many decent works. I also believe that, under the influence of workers, peasants, and soldiers, everyone will write some authentic reportage and sketches at any time, reflecting how the whole nation is invigorated and how it is carrying out socialist construction with overwhelming momentum and ambition. We cannot ask writers to write works immediately upon arriving in the countryside or factories, but I do believe that since they share food, live, and work wholeheartedly with the heroic and invincible people, they will surely also learn how to overcome difficulties and strive for a high tide in literary creation.
    Writers' associations in various places have also carried out rectification work and transferred cadres to lower levels. Taking the general association as an example, the number of cadres transferred to lower levels has reached 50 percent. From then on, the writers' association is no longer like a yamen (government office). Various publications are also undergoing rectification. We ourselves dare not boast about how much has been improved, please representatives, take a look at the recently published literary publications and give criticisms. If there are one or two merits, you may cheer and applaud to show encouragement.
    What are Foreign Stereotypes?
    I also believe that as writers' ideological transformation progresses, the writing style will inevitably change accordingly. Foreign stereotypes will probably not be able to stand their ground.
    The so-called foreign stereotypes, analyzed, seem to be like this:
    Knowing Little but Saying Much
    First stereotype: Knowing little but saying much, not writing tens of thousands of words, it seems not to be considered a high talent. In fact, this is deceiving oneself and others, and there is a suspicion of defrauding royalties. This stereotype should be severely removed. Knowing a lot and saying it concisely, getting straight to the point, and solving problems, shows real ability. Solid articles are articles that reflect the national spirit, and one of the characteristics of our nation is solidity, not being chaotic. Artistic techniques must emphasize control, and talking irresponsibly is the technique of a drunkard.
    Obscure Writing, Headaches to Read
    Second stereotype: Hu Feng and Feng Xuefeng's "style" has always been quite harmful. That is: obscure writing, headaches to read. They describe an egg, and they have to go around ten or eight miles, talking nonsense: there is something round, but (that damn "but") not very round, and perhaps it can be said to be an oval thing, which is probably an egg? This stereotype is really unacceptable! Moreover, under this stereotype, there is often a conspiracy to insinuate and criticize, only because the writing is obscure, it is not easy to see at a glance. We have been with Hu Feng and Feng Xuefeng for twenty or thirty years before we saw their ulterior motives, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. If this camouflage is not completely removed, we will be greatly deceived!
    Awkward Writing, Vague Thought
    Third stereotype: This stereotype is closely related to the previous one, especially prominent in theoretical writing. For many years, there seems to be an inviolable rule for writing theoretical articles: the more awkward the words, the better, the more unclear the thought, the better, the more citations, the better, and the fewer one's own clear opinions, the better. This is all wrong! The more socialism develops, the more criticism and reasoning articles will follow; articles that are neither painful nor itchy, and seemingly right but actually wrong, do not solve problems and have no market. Look, workers and peasants can all reason and criticize, but they always hit the nail on the head and get straight to the point. We must learn from the people and learn to speak vividly, simply, and clearly. We must liberate theoretical writing from that awkward, empty, and lengthy套子(套子, a set pattern or convention)!
    Formulization, Conceptualization
    Fourth stereotype: Formulization and conceptualization. Empty checks cannot be cashed, and empty writers without life experience cannot write substantial works. To remove this stereotype, writers must move, move to the countryside and factories! With life experience, there is confidence, originality, and creation, and thus a hundred flowers bloom together.
    Despising Popularization, Despising Popularity
    Fifth stereotype: This stereotype is also related to rightist writers, from Feng Xuefeng to Liu Shaotang, they all look down on popularization work and popular works. Today, when the whole nation is marching towards a great cultural advance, we must recognize the principle of raising standards through popularization. Our works are things that come from the masses and go to the masses, not for the mutual appreciation of three or five writers. “A strange article for mutual appreciation.” Yes, what everyone can appreciate is a strange article. Articles in which one or two writers give each other a thumbs-up are probably not very strange, and maybe they are just ordinary, otherwise why not hand them over to the people for mutual appreciation? Great principles expressed in clear and readily available words are called going deep in a simple way. Small principles expressed in obscure and difficult-to-understand words are called going shallow in a deep way. Saying strange things without any principles is called not going in or out, utter nonsense! Going deep in a simple way is popular, popular, and something everyone can appreciate.
    Speaking Foreign Language, Hard Learning from Foreigners
    Sixth stereotype: Speaking a foreign language. This is not saying ready-made words, but stubbornly learning from the way foreigners speak Chinese. In Chinese, "背着" (carrying on the back) is enough, it is not necessary to say "在背上背着" (carrying on the back on the back), because putting it on the shoulder is called 扛着 (carrying on the shoulder), putting it under the arm is called 夹着 (carrying under the arm), and there is no confusion. I hope writers, especially young writers, will learn more about the essence of Chinese. Reading classical works is very beneficial.
    Fancy Writing, Regardless of Logic
    Seventh stereotype: Young authors commit this mistake the most. They often only care about fancy writing, regardless of logic. Quote two sentences to see: a petite fat girl. Eyes topped with eyebrows. Petite, in our minds, is like Lin Daiyu; fat is related to plumpness or clumsiness, isn't it? As for the eyes, since there are no small pillars, how can they be topped with eyebrows? Just writing, not thinking, and calling it imaginative thinking, is the origin of this problem. Think more, imaginative thinking is thinking, not talking nonsense.
    Fond of Using Unnecessary Local Dialects
    Eighth stereotype: Fond of using unnecessary local dialects. Real expressive local dialects can be used, and can be slowly elevated to standard Mandarin. However, indiscriminate preference for local dialects is not conducive to the promotion of standard Mandarin. We are language users, and we have a responsibility to do our best for the development and promotion of standard Mandarin.
    To Make the Hearts of Writers Touch the Hearts of the People
    The above is my personal analysis of foreign stereotypes, not necessarily correct, and not necessarily comprehensive. My intention is good, and I sincerely hope that the writing style can be transformed, so that our hearts can touch the hearts of the people through our writing style. Today, there seems to be some separation between our works and the people, and one of the reasons is probably that the writing style is causing trouble. We should remove this obstacle and make the people love our works more. Our new writing style should at least be bright and cheerful, lively and vigorous, with vitality, joy, and revolutionary heroism!
    I support the various reports made by Comrades Bo Yibo, Li Xiannian, Peng Zhen, and Wu Yuzhang at the conference. We writers especially welcome language reform and sincerely hope that it can be vigorously promoted and win a great victory. Writing is our tool of the trade, and we hope that this tool will become lighter and more convenient. With simplified characters and the help of phonetic alphabets, it will be easier to learn, and more and more people will become literate, and our writers' business will be better. Although this is a bit like talking about business, the attitude towards language reform is definitely not rightist!

### 打倒洋八股  舒舍予代表的发言

    打倒洋八股
    舒舍予代表的发言
    去年，在作家里出现了一批右派分子。既是一批，就不在少数；比例越高就越不光荣，请原谅我不详举数字了吧！
    值得一说的倒是我们并没有随便放过一个右派分子。斗争十分激烈。光是批判丁玲等人的大会就开过二十七次之多。右派分子低了头，所有的作家都受到了教育，提高了觉悟。
    在批判大会上，我们不但揭发了右派分子与集团的丑行，也初步批判了他们的有毒素的作品与“文学理论”。今年，我们还要更深入地进行这种批判，以期广大读众同我们一起明辨鲜花与毒草，共同保卫社会主义；并期以马克思主义的文学理论、毛主席所提示的文艺方针，充实我们自己，打击并肃清修正主义和别的一切邪魔外道。由最近一期的“文艺报”里，就看到这个运动的开端。继续批判，再批判，是今年各文学刊物的重要任务之一。
    争取文艺创作来个高潮
    在反击右派得胜之后，作家们争取下乡上山，下工厂和到部队去。各处的作家协会已不再是作家之家，代替它的是农村，是工厂，是部队。只有在这遍布全国的新家庭里，作家才会更快更好地得到思想改造，得到足以反映人民生活的资料与本领，得到为人民创作的热诚与决心。绝大多数的作家都以此为莫大的幸福，都一致感激党的领导与帮助。是的，这次下去的作家，都受到党与政府无微不至的关切与帮助，而且作家协会已拟定了经常支援在各处安家落户的会员们的具体办法，如随时供给他们新的书刊，解决他们家庭中的困难等等。
    我相信：在三年五载之后，我们必能产生不少像样子的作品。我也相信，在工农兵的感染下，大家也会随时写出一些真实的报道性的小品，反映全民族怎样振奋，怎样以排山倒海的气魄与雄心，进行社会主义建设。我们不能要求作家们一到农村或工厂即马上写出作品来，但是我的确相信，他们既与英勇无敌的人民推心置腹地同食同住同工作，他们就必定也学会怎么克服困难，争取文艺创作也来个高潮。
    各处作家协会也进行了整改工作和下放干部。以总会来说，下放干部已达百分之五十。从此，作家协会不再像衙门了。各刊物也都在整改中。已经改进了多少，我们自己不敢夸口，请代表们翻一翻最近出版的文学刊物，给予批评。假若也有一二可取之处，不妨喝喝彩，以示鼓励。
    什么是洋八股
    我也相信：作家们的思想改造一有了进展，文风必然随之一变。洋八股大概要站不住脚了。
    所谓洋八股者，分析起来似乎如此：
    知道的少而说的多
    第一股：知道的少而说的多，不下笔万言，似乎就不算高才。事实上，这是自欺欺人，且有骗取稿费之嫌。这一股应狠狠地去掉。知道的多，而说的精炼，要言不烦，解决问题，才见本领。结结实实的文章才是反映民族精神的文章，我们的民族的特色之一就是结结实实，不乌烟瘴气。艺术的手法必讲控制，信口开河是醉鬼的手法。
    文字晦涩　读之头痛
    第二股：胡风与冯雪峰的“风格”，一向为害不浅。这就是：文字晦涩，读之头痛。他们形容个鸡蛋，也要绕出十里八里，乱说废话：有那么一个圆的，然而（该死的然而）不太圆，似乎也可以说是椭圆的东西，恐怕就是鸡蛋吧？这一股真要不得！而且，在这一股之下，每每隐藏着指槐骂柳的阴谋，只因文字晦涩，不易一眼看出。我们与胡风、冯雪峰相处二三十年，才看出他们的别有用心，披着马列主义外衣，干反党，反社会主义的勾当。这种障眼法不彻底去掉，我们就会还上大当！
    文字别扭　思想模糊
    第三股：这一股与前一股大有关系，在理论文字里特别突出。许多年来，写理论文字的仿佛有一种不可违犯的规矩：字句越别扭越好，思想越不明确越好，引证越多越好，自己的明确意见越少越好。这都不对！社会主义越发展，批评与讲理的文章就随之而越多；不痛不痒，似是而非的文章不解决问题，也就没有市场。看吧，工人农民都会讲理，批评，可总是一针见血，开门见山。我们要向人民学习，学会说得生动，而且简单明确。我们必须把理论文字从那个别扭、空洞、冗长的套子里解放出来！
    公式化　概念化
    第四股：公式化与概念化。空头支票兑不出钱来，没有生活的空头作家也写不出充实的作品。要去掉这一股，作家非搬家不可，搬到农村与工厂去！有了生活，才有信心，独出心裁，有所创造，百花因而齐放。
    轻视普及　轻视通俗
    第五股：这一股也与右派作家有关，上自冯雪峰，下至刘绍棠，都看不起普及工作，看不起通俗作品。在全民族向文化大进军的今天，我们必须认清楚由普及而提高的道理。我们的作品是由群众中来、到群众中去的东西，不是为三五作家彼此欣赏的。“奇文共欣赏”。是的，大家都能欣赏的才是奇文。一二作家彼此互伸大指的文章大概奇不到哪里去，说不定正是稀松平常，要不然为什么不敢交给人民共同欣赏去呢？大道理而用清浅现成的话说出来，叫作深入浅出。小道理而用晦涩难懂的话说出来，叫作浅入深出。没有道理而说些怪话，叫作不入不出，地道废话！深入浅出即是普及的、通俗的，大家都能欣赏的。
    说洋话　硬学外国人
    第六股：说洋话。这就是有现成的话不说，硬学外国人说汉语的样子。在汉语里，“背着”就够了，不必一定说“在背上背着”，因为放在肩上叫作扛着，放在腋下叫作夹着，不发生混乱。我希望作家们，特别是青年作家们，多去了解了解汉语的本质。念念古典作品，大有好处。
    文字花哨　不管逻辑
    第七股：青年作者犯此病者最多。他们往往只顾文字花哨，而不管逻辑。引证两句看看：清秀的胖姑娘。眼睛顶着眉毛。清秀，在我们心里，是林黛玉式的；胖是与丰满或笨重相关的，不是吗？至于眼睛，既没有小柱子，怎么顶着眉毛呢？光写，不想，而且美其名曰形象思维，是这个毛病的所由来。多想想吧，形象思维是思维，不是乱说。
    好用不必要的土话
    第八股：好用不必要的土话。真有表现力的土话可以用，而且慢慢地可以提升到普通话里去。可是，不加选择，偏爱土话，就不利于普通话的推广。我们是语言运用者，我们有责任尽力于普通话的发展与推行。
    要使作家的心碰到人民的心
    以上，是我个人对洋八股的分析，不见得正确，也不见得全面。我的用意是好的，我切盼文风转变，能够通过我们的文字风格，使我们的心碰到人民的心。今天，在我们的作品与人民之间，似乎还有些隔阂，原因之一恐怕就是文风在作怪。我们应当除去这个障碍，叫人民更喜爱我们的作品。我们的新文风至少也该是爽爽朗朗，生动活泼，带着朝气，喜气，和革命的豪气！
    我拥护薄一波同志，李先念同志，彭真同志和吴玉老在大会上所作的各项报告。我们作家特别欢迎文字改革，切盼它能够大力推行，大获全胜。文字是我们这一行的工具，但愿这个工具越来越轻巧灵便。文字简化了，有拼音字母的帮忙，又容易学了，识字的人就越来越多，我们作家的生意也就会越好。这虽有点近乎讲生意经，可是对文字改革的态度确非右派！
