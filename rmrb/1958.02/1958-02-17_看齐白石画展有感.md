Thoughts on Viewing the Qi Baishi Art Exhibition
    Qin Zhongwen

    Master Qi Baishi's posthumous works of poetry, calligraphy, painting, and engraving are vast and cover a wide range of aspects. I will only discuss some of my thoughts on his inheritance of the national painting tradition:

    To become a great painter of an era requires not only individual talent and tireless effort, but also a correct attitude towards the national painting tradition. After seeing this exhibition of Master Qi's posthumous works, my understanding of this point has been further solidified. I believe that Master Qi's achievements not only far surpass those of general modern literati painters, but he also set a good example for us in inheriting tradition. The painting style of the Sui and Tang Dynasties in our country was mostly extremely meticulous. By the Northern Song Dynasty, the requirements of the Painting Academy system further strengthened its realistic depiction. However, on the other hand, some literati also developed the "emphasizing spirit over resemblance" freehand brushwork painting style, such as Wen Yuke, Su Dongpo, Mi Yuanzhang, Wen Riguan, Zheng Suonan, and Liang Fengzi. Similarly, Chen Baiyang, Xu Tianchi, Bada Shanren, Shi Tao in the recent three hundred years, and Zhao Huishu and Wu Changshuo in the recent one hundred years all belong to the system of painters who "emphasize spirit over resemblance" with bold brushstrokes and ink. From the quotes exhibited in Master Baishi's posthumous works exhibition, we can see how much he admired the painting styles of his predecessors such as Qing Teng, Xue Ge, and Shi Tao. Moreover, from various paintings, we can see that from his early years as a carpenter to his last decades, he revealed a variety of traditional techniques, constantly evolving and developing them. From his attitude towards inheriting traditional techniques, we can see that he did not simply copy or rigidly apply the achievements of his predecessors, but comprehensively inherited a variety of techniques, and creatively developed them, making their content and form richer and more vivid. Therefore, after seeing his exhibition, I deeply feel that my own and some fellow painters' past many years of neglecting the developmental viewpoint of weeding through the old to bring forth the new in inheriting tradition is obviously overly conservative. Master Baishi's paintings, which "even children can understand," have won universal love from the world. I wonder how many painters want to learn his painting methods. Through this exhibition, everyone may clearly realize that simply imitating his appearance is not enough to inherit his painting methods. The most important thing is to honestly learn the correct path he took.

    看齐白石画展有感
    秦仲文
    齐白石老人遗作诗、书、画、刻，汪洋浩瀚，方面甚广，我只是谈谈我对他在继承民族绘画传统方面的一些感想：
    要成为一个时代的伟大的画家，不仅是凭借他个人的特殊天才和艰苦不懈的努力，同时，还必须要有正确的态度去对待民族的绘画传统。看过此次齐先生的遗作展，更把我这一点认识得到了衡量。我认为齐先生的成就，不但远远地超过了近代一般文人画家，而且他在继承传统上给我们树立了很好的榜样。我国隋唐的画风大都是极端工细的；到了北宋，由于画院制度的要求更加强了它的形似刻画；但是一方面有一些文人们也发展着“重神遗貌”粗笔大墨的写意画风；如：文与可、苏东坡、米元章、温日观、郑所南、梁风子等。又如：近三百年来的陈白阳、徐天池、八大、石涛和近百年来的赵撝叔、吴缶庐等，都是属于“重神遗貌”粗笔大墨的系统的画家。我们从白石老人遗作展出的语录中，看出他对于前辈画家如：青藤、雪个、石涛等人的画风是那样钦重。又从各个画面看出，自他早年木工时代一直到最后几十年的过程中，透露着多种多样的传统技法，并不断地演变和发展着。从他对待继承传统技法的态度上，更可看出他对于前人的成果，不是生搬和硬套，而是综合地继承多样，把它们作了创造性的发展，使它们的内容和形式更加丰富和更加生动起来。因此，看过他的展览，使我深深感到自己和一些画友们已往许多年中对于继承传统，忽略了推陈出新的发展观点，显然是过分地保守了。白石老人的画“童孺都解”赢得世人普遍的爱好，不知有多少画家要学习他的画法；通过这次的展出，大家可能清楚地认识到要继承他的画法，仅仅袭取了他的外貌是不够的，最重要的还是老老实实地学习他所走的正确道路。
