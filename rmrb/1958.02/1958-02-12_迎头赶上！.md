    Catch Up!
    The Fujian Daily published an editorial on the 5th entitled "Catch Up." The editorial stated that the People's Daily had made a timely criticism on January 15 regarding the slow progress of the water conservancy movement in Fujian Province. Since the provincial party committee took emergency measures, most areas have seen rapid and significant progress in the water conservancy movement. However, many areas are still lagging behind. Comparing the province's water conservancy construction with that of the advanced brother province of Anhui, the difference is indeed too great. Therefore, no region has any reason to be complacent. The editorial called on all regions to thoroughly reject right-leaning conservative thinking and adopt the fastest and most effective revolutionary measures to catch up with the advanced brother provinces.

    迎头赶上！
    福建日报5日发表了“迎头赶上”的社论。社论说，1月15日人民日报对福建省水利运动进展迟缓的情况提出了适时的批评。自从省委采取了紧急措施以后，绝大部分地区的水利运动都有了迅速的明显的进展。但是还有不少地区是落后的。而拿全省兴修水利情况同先进的兄弟省——安徽比较，实在差得太远。因此，不论哪个地区都没有任何理由足以自慰。社论要求各地彻底反掉右倾保守思想，采取最快、最有效的革命措施赶上先进的兄弟省。
