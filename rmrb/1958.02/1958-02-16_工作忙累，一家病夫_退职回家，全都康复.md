    Overworked and Ill Family Recovered After Resigning and Returning Home
    I am a medical worker. From the examples I have encountered in my work, I believe it is necessary to appropriately mobilize some female comrades to resign and return home to participate in household labor.
    In the past, there was a female cadre who frequently came to me for medical treatment. She had a university education. She and her husband originally both participated in health promotion work, earning a total of about 120 yuan per month. They had four children, two of whom were placed in a nursery, and two who were cared for at home by their grandmother. This family of seven used to come to me for medical treatment almost every day in turns. The grandmother was old and frail, and she became ill from exhaustion due to taking care of the children and not getting adequate rest. The two children at home suffered from colds or enteritis due to inadequate care. The two children in the nursery also often suffered from infectious diseases. The couple was busy with both housework and work, running around all day. Not only was their work not done well, but their health was also ruined. As a result, the family was lifeless and financially strained, causing the couple constant worry. At that time, she had considered resigning and returning home to engage in household labor, but she was afraid that returning home would ruin her future, and that her mother-in-law and husband would look down on her as a result, so she did not have the determination to resign. In the end, her health could no longer support it, so she reluctantly resigned and returned home to engage in household labor. With the help of her mother-in-law, not only did her health gradually recover, but the whole family's health improved. Because they rarely saw a doctor or took medicine, and the family expenses were properly arranged, their financial situation was much better than before. The couple no longer worried, and her husband worked with great enthusiasm.
    The improvement in her family situation was obviously the result of her being able to concentrate on arranging housework. At the same time, she was educated and able to educate her four children according to health knowledge, and she could be more economical in her financial planning. As a result, her mother-in-law and husband liked her even more. Once, when I met her, she said to me: If I were to participate in social labor again, I would not want to go, unless society particularly needs it. Now our country's industrial and agricultural production and various tasks are in the Great Leap Forward, and our socialist construction has a great future. My family also has a great future with the prosperity of the motherland. The health of our family of seven is getting stronger day by day, and my husband's work performance will get better and better. As for myself, I will insist on continuous learning and continue to do some work for the masses, so that I do not fall behind and the family is happier. Isn't my future also very bright in this way?

    工作忙累，一家病夫  退职回家，全都康复
    我是一个医务工作者，从我工作中接触到的一些事例来看，我认为适当地动员一部分女同志退职回家参加家务劳动是必要的。
    过去有一位经常到我这里来求医的女干部，她有大学文化程度，她同她的爱人原来都参加卫生宣传工作，每月共收入一百二十元左右。他们有四个孩子，其中二个放在托儿所，二个在家里由祖母照料。这一家七口，过去几乎每天都要轮流到我这里来看病。祖母年老力衰，因照顾孩子得不到适当的休息而累病了；两个在家的孩子，因为照顾不周，不是这个伤风，就是那个闹肠炎；在托儿所的两个孩子，也常常患传染病。他们夫妇俩，又管家务，又忙工作，整日奔忙，不但工作没做好，而且身体也累坏了。这样一来，家庭中毫无生气，经济也非常拮据，夫妇经常为此发愁。当时她曾想退职回家从事家务劳动，但是怕回家后就断送了自己的前途，又怕婆婆和爱人因此而看不起她，所以没有决心退职。最后她身体实在支持不了，只好勉强离职回家从事家务劳动，加上婆婆的帮助，不但她的身体日渐康复，全家健康好转，而且因为很少看病吃药，家庭开支安排得当，经济情况也比过去宽裕多了。他们夫妇二人再也不犯愁，她爱人工作起来劲头也很高。
    她的家庭情况所以能好转，显然是因为她能集中精力安排家务的结果。同时她又有文化，能够按着保健知识教养四个孩子，可以在经济上更好地精打细算，结果婆婆和爱人愈发喜欢她。有一次我碰到她，她对我这样说：如果让我再去参加社会劳动，我是不想去了，除非社会特别需要。现在我国的工农业生产和各项工作都在大跃进，我们的社会主义建设真是大有前途；我的家，也随着祖国的繁荣而大有前途；我们一家七口的身体日益健壮，爱人工作成绩将会愈来愈好；我自己呢，也要坚持不断学习，不断为群众做些工作，使自己不落后，家庭更美满。这样我的前途不是也很美好么？
