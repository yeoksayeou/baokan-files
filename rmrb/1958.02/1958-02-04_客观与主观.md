Editor's Notes

　　Objective and Subjective
    After all kinds of struggles, the people of northern Shaanxi have created a large-scale grain production record in the barren, even historically known as "barren land," high and cold mountainous areas. This is inspiring news, and it is also thought-provoking news. Comparing the northern Shaanxi area with the "land of fish and rice" Taihu Lake area of Jiangsu, one has extremely difficult natural conditions, and the other has very favorable natural conditions. However, the one with difficult conditions has achieved a leap forward in production, crossing the Yellow River and then the Yangtze River; while the one with favorable conditions has been slow to advance. Why is this so? The reason is very simple: one is satisfied with the progress already made, content with the status quo, and does not know how to make progress; the other is trying every possible means to seek ways to increase production and is never satisfied. This situation shows that people's subjective initiative plays a decisive role. Those with high confidence and great drive can overcome difficulties and create new situations in any difficult environment; while those with insufficient confidence and weak fighting spirit, even with very good conditions, will find it difficult to achieve much. This comparison tells people: objective favorable conditions must be coupled with active subjective efforts to take effect; objective unfavorable conditions can be changed through subjective efforts.

　　客观与主观
    陕北人民经过种种斗争，在贫瘠的甚至是一向被人称为“不毛之地”的高寒山区，创造了大面积的粮食丰产纪录。这是振奋人心的消息，也是发人深思的消息。把陕北地区同“鱼米之乡”的江苏太湖地区对比，一个是自然条件困难万分，一个是自然条件非常优越。但是，条件困难的在生产上取得了跃进，跨过了黄河，又跨过了长江；而条件优越的反而迟迟不进。为什么会这样呢？原因很简单：一个是满足于既得的进步，安于现状，不知进取；一个是千方百计寻求增产门路，永不满足。这种情况说明，人的主动精神是起决定性作用的。信心高干劲大的，在任何困难的环境里都能打破难关，创出新局面；而信心不足，斗志不坚的，则虽有很好的条件，也很难作出多大的成绩。这个对比告诉人们：客观的有利条件，必须加上主观的积极努力才能发生作用；客观的不利条件，则能通过主观的努力得到改变。
