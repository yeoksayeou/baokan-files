The Greatest Brotherly Alliance
—Celebrating the Eighth Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association

Eight years ago today, two great socialist countries, China and the Soviet Union, concluded a brotherly alliance of friendship and mutual assistance. The sacred purpose of this alliance is to closely unite and cooperate to prevent aggression, safeguard peace, and provide mutual assistance in building the most beautiful life for mankind and realizing mankind's highest ideals—socialism and communism—within our respective countries. This lofty goal not only conforms to the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Soviet people but also to the fundamental interests of the people of the world. For eight years, the people of China and the Soviet Union have steadfastly made efforts worthy of this great goal. Precisely because of this, this great brotherly alliance has always been regarded by the people of all countries as the most powerful and reliable guarantee for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world and promoting the progressive cause of mankind. Precisely because of this, this brotherly alliance appears so powerful and invincible.

Today, the world has entered a new era in which the East wind prevails over the West wind. Socialism has not only become a powerful world system, but its strength has also surpassed that of imperialism. Here, the existence and continuous growth of the great Soviet Union, the existence and continuous growth of the great People's Republic of China, and the establishment, consolidation, and development of the great Sino-Soviet brotherly alliance have undoubtedly played a decisive role.

The October Socialist Revolution carried out by the Soviet people forty years ago was the greatest pioneering undertaking in human history. It opened a new century in world history. The great country created by this revolution, the Soviet Union, is invincible. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "The reason why the Soviet Union is invincible is because it is a country that has replaced the capitalist system with the socialist system, a country that has replaced the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie with the dictatorship of the proletariat, a country that develops social productive forces at a speed unattainable by capitalist countries, and a country that genuinely practices proletarian internationalism, genuinely opposes national oppression, and aids the liberation of oppressed nations." And the existence and growth of this country, its history, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, convince people that "the proletariat will inevitably defeat the bourgeoisie, socialism will inevitably defeat capitalism, and oppressed nations will inevitably defeat imperialism." Therefore, the Soviet Union has always been reasonably regarded as the leader of socialist countries and as a guiding light and inspiration for the working people of the world and all oppressed nations.

The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, which followed the great victory of the October Revolution and the anti-fascist war, has great world historical significance. As Comrade Khrushchev said, "The victory of the Chinese Revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China are the most significant historical events since the Great October Revolution." This victory greatly promoted the liberation movement of the world's oppressed nations and marked a great leap forward for socialism on a global scale. The existence and growth of People's China has caused a definite and complete change in the balance of world forces in favor of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

When the Soviet people and the working people of the world celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution with revelry last year, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council and the Central Committee of Chinese Communist Party pointed out in a congratulatory telegram to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "The Sino-Soviet alliance formed in 1950 is the greatest alliance between nations in human history. China and the Soviet Union are two powerful countries in the world, possessing more than 800 million united people. The formation of a strong alliance between our two countries not only greatly strengthens the superiority of the socialist camp, but also deals a severe blow to the aggressive and war policies of the imperialist bloc." This assertion completely conforms to objectively existing facts. China and the Soviet Union are vast in territory and abundant in resources, with large populations. The people of these two countries are people who have been tempered for a long time and have a relatively high degree of consciousness under the leadership of the most advanced and scientific ideology of mankind, namely Marxism-Leninism. The unity of the people of the two countries is based on proletarian internationalism and has been tempered and tested in long-term common struggles. Therefore, no force in the world can separate them. The Soviet Union possesses powerful socialist industry and agriculture, and the most advanced science and culture. We in China are also working hard to build modern industry and agriculture, and modern science and culture. China and the Soviet Union share the same fate and breathe the same air as the entire socialist camp. They regard strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, as their sacred international duty. Both China and the Soviet Union are working to develop comprehensive cooperation among socialist countries to strengthen the construction of socialist countries. In particular, the great and selfless assistance provided by the Soviet Union to fraternal countries has played an invaluable role in enhancing the material and spiritual wealth of the socialist camp.

For eight years, the Sino-Soviet brotherly alliance has repeatedly dealt heavy blows to the aggressive and war policies of the imperialist camp, headed by the United States. In 1950, when the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, the Chinese people rose up to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, sending their volunteer army to fight alongside the Korean People's Army against the U.S. aggressors. The just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people received the full support of the Soviet Union, thereby crushing the U.S. plot to expand the war and forcing the United States to accept an armistice. At the Geneva Conference held in 1954, thanks to the joint efforts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet Union and China, an agreement was finally reached to restore peace in Indochina. In 1956, Britain, France, and Israel launched a war of aggression against Egypt. The Soviet Union and China firmly supported the just struggle of the Egyptian people, and the Soviet Union promptly issued stern warnings to the aggressors, forcing Britain and France to cease fire in Egypt. In 1957, the United States instigated Turkey and, together with Turkey, carried out military provocations against Syria, attempting to rekindle the flames of war in the Near East. The Soviet Union immediately warned the aggressors, and China gave the Syrian people firm support. Thanks to the Syrian people and other Arab people adhering to their anti-aggression stance, and thanks to the solidarity of the people of the Soviet Union and China and the people of the world with the Syrian people, the U.S. imperialist plot of provocation had to end in failure. Over the past eight years, the Soviet Union and China have waged a series of struggles to achieve disarmament, ban atomic and thermonuclear weapons, strive for peaceful coexistence, and seek to resolve international disputes through negotiation. The Soviet Union's repeated proposals for disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons in the United Nations have received China's full support. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by China and India have received the full support of the Soviet Union. China firmly supports the Soviet Union's proposal for a peaceful solution to the German question and the conclusion of a European collective security treaty. The Soviet Union fully supports China's proposal for the conclusion of a collective peace treaty for the Asian and Pacific region. On December 13, 1957, the Soviet Union submitted to all member states of the United Nations a proposal on eliminating the threat of war and realizing peaceful coexistence, which was a new and significant effort made by the Soviet Union for the cause of peace. The Chinese government issued a statement on December 19 of the same year, expressing its full support for this Soviet proposal. On January 9 this year, the Soviet government put forward new proposals on easing international tensions, advocating the immediate convening of a summit conference of various countries to discuss the prohibition of nuclear weapons, disarmament, and the strengthening of international cooperation. Subsequently, Soviet leaders repeatedly made peace proposals to the governments of relevant countries. This proposal immediately received our country's full support. At the Fifth Session of the National People's Congress on February 10 this year, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai formally declared that "China is ready to work with other countries to make active efforts to implement these proposals and assume corresponding obligations." Now this peace proposal has been warmly supported by the vast number of people in countries around the world and has become an irresistible trend.

From this, it can be seen that the great Sino-Soviet brotherly alliance is indeed one of the decisive factors in strengthening the entire socialist camp, combating the aggressive forces of imperialism, and promoting the further prevalence of the East wind over the West wind. Is this not obvious?

The declaration of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries issued in November 1957 correctly pointed out: "In our era, the development of the world depends on the process and outcome of the competition between the two opposing social systems." The Soviet Union, China, and the entire socialist camp can use countless examples to prove that the socialist system has immeasurable superiority over the capitalist system; they can give people sufficient reasons to believe that the socialist system can definitely win the final victory in the peaceful competition with the capitalist system. In order to strive for this victory, while calling for and striving for peaceful coexistence between the two systems, the Soviet Union and China have separately put forward the great historical task of catching up with or surpassing the industrial output of the United States and Britain in about fifteen years. That is to say, the Soviet people are striving to catch up with or surpass the current industrial output of the United States within fifteen years, and the people of our country are striving to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer. When China and the Soviet Union have achieved this great task, and the entire socialist camp is also working hard to expand industrial and agricultural production, then the socialist camp will far surpass the imperialist countries not only in the speed of industrial and agricultural development but also in the volume of industrial and agricultural production. In other words, socialism will leave capitalism even further behind, and world lasting peace will have a truly reliable guarantee.

The people of China and the Soviet Union have unparalleled confidence in completing their great tasks. Both our countries are socialist countries with vast territories, abundant resources, and large populations. Here, the social productive forces have been thoroughly liberated, and the relations of production that are basically adapted to the development of productive forces can be continuously and rationally adjusted. Therefore, industrial and agricultural production can inevitably develop rapidly and continuously. In Britain and the United States, due to the corruption of the capitalist system, the relations of production restrict the development of productive forces. Therefore, economic development is slow, and recessions and crises constantly occur. Comparing the Soviet Union with the United States, the United States increased its industrial production threefold from 1913 to 1957, while the Soviet Union increased it thirty-twofold during the same period. In 1956, the Soviet Union's industrial development rate was more than three times faster than that of the United States; in 1957, it was nine times faster. Now the Soviet Union's industrial production is leaping forward at an even faster pace, while the United States' industry is constantly declining. Now the operating rate of the U.S. steel industry is only 56%. According to the draft plan formulated by the Soviet Union, by 1972, the Soviet Union will have to reach or exceed the current output of the United States for all major industrial products, including 250 million to 300 million tons of iron ore, more than 75 million tons of pig iron, 100 million to 120 million tons of steel, more than 650 million tons of coal, more than 350 million tons of oil, and more than 800 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. We believe that the heroic Soviet people will surely be able to fulfill the tasks stipulated in this draft ahead of schedule.

The Chinese people also have full confidence in completing the glorious task of catching up with and surpassing Britain in fifteen years or a little longer. We successfully completed the first five-year plan last year. The rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle that began last year have achieved great victories. This victory has promoted the unprecedented upsurge of the Chinese people today in moving mountains and filling seas, and in the socialist great leap forward. This vigorous revolutionary drive will play a regular role in the future, so that the upsurge of industrial and agricultural production construction can not only be sustained but can also rise day by day. During our country's first five-year plan, industrial production increased by an average of more than 18% per year, while in Britain, from 1937 to 1956, industrial production increased by an average of only 2% per year. In terms of the output of major products, during our country's first five-year plan, steel output increased by an average of 31.8% per year, pig iron increased by 25.6%, and coal increased by 14%. In Britain, from 1941 to 1956, steel output increased by an average of only 3.5% per year, pig iron increased by 3.9%, and coal increased by 0.5%. At this rate, as long as we make correct and sufficient efforts, we are entirely capable of realizing the task of catching up with or surpassing Britain ahead of schedule.

It should be emphasized that the comprehensive and close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union plays a huge role in the completion of the task of catching up with or surpassing Britain and the United States in fifteen years. First of all, only through Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation and the united cooperation of the entire socialist camp can we better strive for an international environment of peace so that we can devote ourselves wholeheartedly to peaceful domestic construction. Secondly, the comprehensive development of economic and cultural cooperation between China and the Soviet Union plays an extremely important role in the socialist and communist construction of the two countries. It should be particularly pointed out that the Soviet Union's comprehensive, generous, and selfless assistance to our country is extremely important for the rapid advancement of our country's socialist construction. When our country was severely lacking in funds during the economic recovery period and the early stage of construction, the Soviet Union gave us preferential loans, the total amount of which was equivalent to 5.294 billion yuan in RMB. After our country entered a period of planned and large-scale economic construction, the Soviet Union vigorously helped our country carry out modern industrial construction. According to the agreements of 1953 and 1954, the Soviet Union decided to help our country build and rebuild 156 important industrial enterprises. These enterprises constituted the backbone of industrial construction during our country's first five-year plan and were of decisive significance for our country's socialist industrialization. In the construction of these enterprises, the Soviet Union helped us with design, supplied the latest machinery and equipment, and sent a large number of experts to provide specific guidance. By the end of 1957, 57 enterprises had been fully completed, and another 10 had been partially completed and put into production. In 1957 alone, 22 enterprises were completed, including the Benxi Iron and Steel Company, Heilongjiang Steel Plant, Jilin Fertilizer Plant, Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant, Harbin Boiler Factory, Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory, Taiyuan No. 1 Thermal Power Plant, and Jiamusi Paper Mill. According to the agreement signed in April 1956, the Soviet Union decided to help our country build another 55 major projects.

The trade between China and the Soviet Union has grown tremendously in recent years, which plays an important role in promoting the construction of the two countries and improving the lives of the people of the two countries. Currently, trade with the Soviet Union accounts for more than one-half of our country's foreign trade. In the Soviet Union's foreign trade, trade with China accounts for about one-quarter of the total trade.

Over the past eight years, scientific and technological cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has developed rapidly. In particular, the Soviet Union's assistance to our country has played a huge role in helping our country get rid of its backwardness in science and technology as soon as possible and catch up with the advanced international levels. Since 1954, the Soviet Union has provided our country with more than 3,000 technical materials of various kinds. Our country has also provided the Soviet Union with about 300 technical materials. The Soviet Union also helped our country formulate a twelve-year plan for the development of science and technology, and helped our country build the first atomic reactor and the first cyclotron. Thanks to the Soviet Union's technical assistance, our country has built the fully modern First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the jet aircraft manufacturing plant, and the great projects such as the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. In December last year, China and the Soviet Union signed a scientific cooperation agreement, and in January this year, they signed a protocol on jointly conducting and Soviet helping China conduct major scientific and technological research. This will have a huge and far-reaching impact on the development of science and technology in both countries, especially in China, in the future. The successful implementation of the China-Soviet cultural cooperation implementation plan in the past two years eloquently illustrates this point.

The comprehensive and close cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union is constantly developing and consolidating. Common interests and common ideals closely link our two countries together. Therefore, we can sincerely respect, trust, assist, and encourage each other. The principle of unifying internationalism and patriotism is being realized in our mutual relations. Imperialist reactionaries and the bourgeois rightists in China always want to use despicable means of spreading rumors, slander, and sowing discord to undermine the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union and to undermine the friendly unity between socialist countries. In 1956, didn't the imperialist reactionaries launch a fierce anti-Soviet and anti-communist movement? In 1957, didn't the bourgeois rightists in our country also launch a fierce clamor against the Soviet Union and communism? But what was the result? The result could only end with the complete disappointment and tragic failure of this group of reactionaries. And the Soviet Union, China, and the entire socialist camp not only still stand majestically between heaven and earth, but also are more united, more vigorous, and more consolidated and powerful. The successful launch of two artificial satellites by the Soviet Union in 1957 and the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution in Moscow by representatives of 64 communist and workers' parties, and the meeting held and the declaration of great historical significance issued, symbolize the unprecedented unity and prosperity of the socialist forces and mark a new turning point in human history. The visit of Chairman Voroshilov to China in 1957 and Chairman Mao Zedong's leading our country's delegation to the Soviet Union to participate in the celebrations of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution marked a new upsurge in Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation. The East wind prevails over the West wind, socialism prevails over capitalism, and the forces of peace prevail over the forces of war. This is already a settled fact in the world, and no one can resist it.

The Chinese people love and respect the great Soviet people and regard them as their teachers and elder brothers. At the same time, we sincerely thank them. As we celebrate the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance today, the Chinese people will strengthen the fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union with greater revolutionary vigor, earnestly learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and science and technology to accelerate our country's socialist construction, and more closely cooperate in all aspects, unite the vast number of people around the world, and fight against the aggressive and war policies of the imperialist group headed by the United States, safeguard world peace, and promote the progressive cause of mankind.

    最伟大的兄弟同盟
    ——庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订八周年
    中苏友好协会总会秘书长　钱俊瑞
    八年前的今天，两个伟大的社会主义国家，中国和苏联，缔结了兄弟般的友好互助同盟。这个同盟的神圣目的就在于紧密地团结合作，防止侵略，保卫和平，并且相互提供援助，各自在本国范围内建设人类最美满的生活，实现人类最高的理想——社会主义和共产主义。这个崇高的目标，不仅符合中苏两国人民的根本利益，而且符合全世界人民的根本利益。同时，中苏两国人民八年来始终坚定不移地作了无愧于这个伟大目标的努力。正因为这样，这个伟大的兄弟同盟一直被各国人民看作维护远东与世界和平、促进人类进步事业的最有力和最可靠的保证。正因为这样，这个兄弟同盟显得那样强大无敌。
    今天，世界已经进入了东风压倒西风的新时代。社会主义不仅已经成为强大的世界体系，它的力量也已经胜过了帝国主义的力量。在这里，伟大的苏联的存在和不断壮大，伟大的中华人民共和国的存在和不断壮大，伟大的中苏兄弟同盟的成立和不断巩固和发展，无疑地起了决定性的作用。
    苏联人民在四十年前进行的十月社会主义革命，是人类自有历史以来最伟大的创举，它开辟了世界历史的新世纪。这个革命所创造的伟大国家苏联是不可战胜的。毛泽东同志指出，“苏联之所以不可战胜，就是因为苏联是一个用社会主义制度代替了资本主义制度的国家，是一个用无产阶级专政代替了资产阶级专政的国家，是一个以资本主义国家所不能有的速度发展社会生产力的国家，是一个真正实行无产阶级的国际主义、真正反对民族压迫和援助被压迫民族解放的国家。”而这个国家的存在和壮大，这个国家的历史，又正像毛泽东同志所说的，使人们确信，“无产阶级必然能够战胜资产阶级，社会主义必然能够战胜资本主义，被压迫民族必然能够战胜帝国主义”。因此，苏联一向被合情合理地认为是社会主义国家的首领，是全世界劳动人民和一切被压迫民族的指路明灯和鼓舞者。
    继十月革命和反法西斯战争的伟大胜利之后所发生的中国人民革命的胜利具有伟大的世界历史意义。正像赫鲁晓夫同志所说的，“中国革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立是伟大的十月革命后最重大的历史事件。”这个胜利极大地推动了世界被压迫民族的解放运动，同时标志着社会主义在世界范围内的大踏步跃进。人民中国的存在和壮大使世界力量的对比发生了确定的完全有利于和平、民主和社会主义阵营的变化。
    当去年苏联人民和全世界劳动人民用狂欢来庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会、国务院和中共中央在给苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议和苏共中央的贺电中指出：“在1950年结成的中苏联盟，是人类历史上国家之间最伟大的联盟。中苏两国是世界上两个强大的国家，拥有八万万以上团结一致的人民。我们两国结成为坚固的同盟，不仅大大地加强了社会主义阵营的优势，而且使帝国主义集团的侵略政策和战争政策遭受严重的打击。”这个论断完全符合于客观存在的事实。中苏两国地大物博，人口众多。这两国的人民群众都是在人类最先进最科学的思想即马克思列宁主义思想的领导下，久经锻炼的、有比较高的觉悟程度的人民。两国人民的团结一致是以无产阶级的国际主义为基础的，同时又在长期的共同奋斗中经过了千锤百炼的，因此世界上没有任何力量可以把他们分开。苏联拥有强大的社会主义工业和农业，拥有最先进的科学和文化。我们中国也在努力建设现代的工业和农业，现代的科学和文化。中苏两国同整个社会主义阵营共命运，同呼吸。它们以增强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结作为自己神圣的国际义务。中苏两国都努力于发展社会主义各国的全面合作，来加强社会主义各国的建设。特别是苏联对兄弟国家所给予的伟大无私的援助，对社会主义阵营物质财富和精神财富的增强，起了不可估价的作用。
    八年来，中苏兄弟同盟对于以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的侵略政策和战争政策，曾经一再二、三再四地给以沉重的打击。1950年美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争，中国人民就起来抗美援朝，派出自己的志愿军同朝鲜人民军并肩抗击美国侵略者。中朝人民的正义斗争得到了苏联的全力支持，从而粉碎了美国扩大战争的阴谋，迫使美国接受停战。在1954年举行的日内瓦会议上，由于越南民主共和国和苏中两国的共同努力，终于达成了恢复印度支那和平的协议。1956年，英、法和以色列发动了侵略埃及的战争。苏联和中国一起坚决支持埃及人民的正义斗争，苏联并且及时地给侵略者以严厉的警告，迫使英、法在埃及停火。1957年美国又唆使土耳其，并且同土耳其一起对叙利亚进行军事挑衅，企图在中近东重新燃起战火。苏联立即向侵略者提出警告，中国也给叙利亚人民以坚决的支持。由于叙利亚人民和其它阿拉伯人民坚持反侵略的立场，由于苏中两国人民和全世界人民对叙利亚人民的声援，美帝国主义那一次的挑衅阴谋不能不归于失败。八年来，苏中两国为争取裁减军队、禁止原子武器和热核子武器，为争取和平共处，争取用协商方式解决国际争端，进行了一系列的斗争。苏联在联合国屡次提出的裁军和禁止核武器的建议，都得到中国的完全支持。中国和印度共同倡议的和平共处五项原则得到苏联的全力支持。中国坚决支持苏联提出的和平解决德国问题和缔结欧洲集体安全公约的主张。苏联完全支持中国提出的缔结亚洲和太平洋区域集体和平公约的建议。1957年12月13日，苏联向联合国全体会员国提出关于消除战争威胁和实现和平共处的建议，这是苏联为和平事业所作的新的重大努力。中国政府在同年12月19日发表声明，表示完全支持苏联的这一建议。今年1月9日，苏联政府又提出了关于缓和国际紧张局势的新建议，主张立即召开各国首脑会议，讨论禁止核武器、裁军和加强国际合作问题。以后，苏联领袖们又再三地向有关各国政府提出和平建议。这个建议立即得到我国的全力支持。我国周恩来总理在今年2月10日全国人民代表大会第五次会议上，正式声明，“中国准备同其它国家一起，为实现这些建议作出积极的努力并且承担相应的义务。”现在这个和平建议已经得到世界各国广大人民的热烈拥护，成为“莫之能御”的潮流。
    由此可见，伟大的中苏兄弟同盟确实是壮大整个社会主义阵营，打击帝国主义侵略势力，促进东风更进一步压倒西风的决定因素之一，这难道还不明显么？
    1957年11月发表的社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的宣言曾经正确地指出：“在我们的时代里，世界的发展取决于两个对立的社会制度竞赛的进程和结果。”苏联、中国以及整个社会主义阵营都可以用无数的事例证明，社会主义制度比起资本主义制度来有着不可计量的优越性；都可以给人们充分的根据，相信社会主义制度在同资本主义制度的和平竞赛中，决然可以赢得最后的胜利。为着争取这个胜利，苏中两国在号召和争取两个制度和平共处的同时，已经分别地提出了在十五年左右赶上或者超过美英两国工业产量的伟大历史任务，这就是说，苏联人民争取在十五年内赶上或超过美国目前的工业产量，我国人民争取在十五年或者更多一点时间内在钢铁和其它重要工业品产量方面赶上或者超过英国。当苏中两国实现了这个伟大任务，同时整个社会主义阵营也都努力扩大工农业生产，到那时，社会主义阵营不但在工农业发展的速度方面，而且在工农业的生产量方面也都远远地超过帝国主义国家。也就是说，社会主义就会把资本主义更加远远地抛在后面了，世界的持久和平也就有确实可靠的保障了。
    中苏两国人民是具有无比的信心来完成自己的伟大任务的。我们两国都是地大、物博、人多的社会主义国家。在我们这里，社会生产力已经得到了彻底的解放，基本上适应于生产力发展的生产关系又能够不断地得到合理的调整，因而工农业生产必然能够得到不断的迅速的发展。在英美两国，由于资本主义制度的腐朽性，生产关系束缚着生产力的发展，因此经济发展缓慢，并且不断地发生衰退和危机。拿苏联同美国来比，美国从1913年到1957年，工业生产增加了三倍，而苏联在同时期内却增加了三十二倍。1956年，苏联工业发展速度比美国快三倍多；1957年快九倍。现在苏联的工业生产正以更快的步伐向前跃进，而美国的工业则在不断衰退，现在美国钢铁工业的开工率只达到56％。根据苏联拟定的草案，到1972年苏联各种主要工业品都要达到或者超过美国目前的产量，其中铁矿石要达到二亿五千万到三亿吨，生铁达到七千五百万吨以上，钢达到一亿到一亿二千万吨，煤达到六亿五千万吨以上，石油达到三亿五千万吨以上，电力达到八千亿度以上。我们相信，英勇的苏联人民一定能够提前实现这个草案所规定的任务。
    中国人民同样具有充分的信心在十五年或者更多一点的时间内完成赶上和超过英国的光荣任务。我们在去年已经胜利地完成了第一个五年计划。从去年开始进行的整风运动和反右派斗争已经取得了巨大的胜利，这个胜利促成了今天全中国人民空前高涨的移山填海、旋乾转坤的社会主义大干劲。这种蓬蓬勃勃的革命干劲将在今后发生经常的作用，使工农业生产建设的高潮不但能够持久，而且能够日益高涨。我国在第一个五年计划期间，工业生产量每年平均增长18％以上，而英国从1937年到1956年的十九年中，工业生产量每年平均只增长2％。就主要产品的产量来看，我国第一个五年计划期间内，钢产量每年平均增长31.8％，生铁增长25.6％，煤增长14％。英国从1941年到1956年，钢产量每年平均只增长3.5％，生铁增长3.9％，煤增长0.5％。按照这样的速度，只要我们作正确和足够的努力，我们完全有可能提早实现赶上或者超过英国的任务。
    应该着重地指出，中苏两国的全面和密切的合作，对于两国要完成十五年赶上或者超过英美的任务，有着巨大的作用。首先，只有中苏友好合作和整个社会主义阵营的团结合作，才能够更好地争取国际和平环境，以便专心致意地从事国内的和平建设。其次，中苏两国经济和文化合作的全面展开，对于两国的社会主义和共产主义的建设起着极其重大的作用。特别应该指出，苏联对我国的全面的慷慨无私的援助，对我国社会主义建设的迅速前进是极端重要的。当我国在经济恢复时期和建设初期资金十分缺乏的时候，苏联就给予我们以优惠的贷款，这种贷款的总额折合人民币达五十二亿九千四百万元。当我国进入有计划的大规模的经济建设时期以后，苏联就大力帮助我国进行现代化的工业建设。根据1953年和1954年的协定，苏联决定帮助我国新建和改建一百五十六项重要工业企业，这些企业构成了我国第一个五年计划期内工业建设的骨干，对于我国社会主义工业化有决定性的意义。在这些企业的建设中，苏联帮助我们设计，供给最新式的机器设备，并且派遣大批专家作具体的指导。到1957年年底，已有五十七项企业全部建成，另有十项部分建成，并已投入生产。单在1957年建成的就有二十二项之多，其中重要的有本溪钢铁公司，黑龙江钢厂，吉林肥料厂，吉林电石厂，哈尔滨锅炉厂，西安电力电容器厂，太原第一热电站，佳木斯造纸厂等。根据1956年4月签订的协定，苏联又决定再帮助我国建设五十五项重大工程。
    中苏两国的贸易近年来有巨大的发展，这对于促进两国建设和改善两国人民的生活具有重要的作用。目前在我国的对外贸易中，同苏联的贸易占总额的二分之一以上。在苏联的对外贸易中，同中国的贸易约占贸易总额的四分之一。
    八年来，中苏两国的科学技术合作迅速地发展，特别是苏联对我国的帮助对于我国科学技术尽快摆脱落后状态，迎头赶上国际先进水平，起着巨大的作用。从1954年以来，苏联供给我国的各种技术资料就达三千多项。我国供给苏联的技术资料也有三百项左右。苏联还帮助我国拟定科学技术发展的十二年规划，帮助我国建立第一座原子反应堆和第一个回旋加速器。由于苏联的技术援助，我国建成了完全现代化的第一汽车制造厂、喷气式飞机制造厂以及武汉长江大桥等伟大工程。去年12月中苏两国签订了科学合作协定，今年1月又签订了关于共同进行和苏联帮助中国进行重大科学技术研究的议定书，这对于今后两国特别是对中国的科学技术的发展将要发生巨大和深远的影响。
    中苏两国的文化合作八年来也有很大的发展。据不完全的统计，八年来苏联访问中国的文化、艺术、教育、卫生、体育等方面的代表团共一百多起，二千多人；中国派往苏联的上述各方面的代表团有八十多起，二千多人。八年来，我国翻译和出版了苏联的著作一万三千多种，印行了二亿二千九百多万册。从1949年到1957年年底，我国放映了苏联影片二百八十九部，观众达十六亿一千五百多万人次。从1951年到1957年，我国共派遣留苏学生六千五百多人，另外有实习生七千一百多人。1956年7月中苏两国政府签订了中苏文化合作协定，从此两国的文化合作展开了更加全面和更加有计划地开展的远景，这对于两国社会主义文化的发展和两国人民兄弟友谊的增进都有极其重要的作用。这两年的中苏文化合作执行计划的圆满执行就雄辩地说明了这一点。
    中苏两国人民这样全面的亲密无间的合作，正在不断发展和巩固。共同的利益和共同的理想把我们两个国家紧紧地联结在一起，因此我们能够真诚地互相尊重，互相信任，互相援助，互相鼓舞。在我们的相互关系中实现着国际主义和爱国主义相统一的原则。帝国主义反动派和中国国内的资产阶级右派总想用造谣中伤，挑拨离间的卑鄙手段，来破坏中苏两国的友好团结，破坏社会主义各国之间的友好团结。1956年，帝国主义反动派不是其势汹汹地搞了一阵反苏反共的运动么？1957年我国国内的资产阶级右派不是也其势汹汹地搞了一阵反苏反共的叫嚣么？但是结果怎样呢？结果只能以这批反动派的完全失望和惨遭失败而告终。而苏联、中国和整个社会主义阵营却不仅依然巍然存在于天地之间，而且更加团结一致，更加朝气蓬勃，更加巩固强大了。1957年苏联的两颗人造卫星发射成功和六十四个共产党和工人党的代表到莫斯科庆祝十月革命四十周年，并且开了会议，发表了具有伟大历史意义的宣言，这就象征着社会主义力量的空前团结和兴旺发达，标志着人类历史的新的转折点。1957年伏罗希洛夫主席访问中国和毛泽东主席率领我国代表团前往苏联参加伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的庆典，又标志着中苏友好合作的新高涨。东风压倒西风，社会主义胜过资本主义，和平势力胜过战争势力，这已经是世界的定局，是谁都不能抗拒的了。
    中国人民热爱和尊敬伟大的苏联人民，把他们看作自己的老师和老大哥。同时，我们又衷心地感谢他们。当我们今天庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订八周年的时候，中国人民将以更大的革命干劲，加强中苏两国的兄弟友谊，认真地学习苏联的先进经验和科学技术，来加速我国的社会主义建设，并且更加密切我们两国在各方面的合作，团结全世界广大人民，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略政策和战争政策，维护世界和平，促进人类进步事业而奋斗。（附图片）
