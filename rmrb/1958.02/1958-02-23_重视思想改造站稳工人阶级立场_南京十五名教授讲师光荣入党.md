Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd: Recently, fifteen professors and lecturers from various universities in Nanjing gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party.

This group of senior intellectuals, approved as probationary members of the Chinese Communist Party, had undergone training in previous political movements, carried out ideological remolding relatively well, and also studied politics relatively conscientiously. During the rectification and anti-Rightist struggles, they were able to stand on the working class standpoint to safeguard the interests of the Party. Huang Ruicai, Director of the Department of Soil and Agricultural Chemistry at Nanjing Agricultural College, in addition to actively delving into his professional work, was able to closely rely on the Party and the masses to strive to improve his class consciousness. During the days when the Rightists attacked the Party, he did not lose his way, was able to promptly distinguish right from wrong, and saw through the Rightists' conspiracy. Professor Liu Yinong, who formerly served as the Director of General Affairs at Nanjing Agricultural College, when Rightists slandered him as "having a position but no power" and incited him to attack the Party, refuted the Rightists with the many facts that the Party trusted him; later, in the anti-Rightist struggle, he also collected materials inside and outside the school to refute the Rightists. Xue Qiunong, a lecturer at Nanjing Aeronautical College, had applied to join the Party several times after liberation, accepted the Party's observation for a relatively long period, and worked actively and tirelessly. During the rectification and anti-Rightist struggles, Xue Qiunong stood on the Party's position, used the contrast between the old and new societies and the achievements of socialist construction seen with his own eyes in the years since liberation to educate the masses, refuted the Rightists' rumors and slanders, and waged a resolute struggle against the Rightists. He applied to join the Party for the third time during the movement and was gloriously approved.

Currently, these probationary Party members are actively striving to participate in physical labor and study politics, aiming to further temper themselves into intellectuals of the working class who are both red and expert.

    重视思想改造站稳工人阶级立场
    南京十五名教授讲师光荣入党
    新华社南京22日电　南京各高等学校最近有十五名教授、讲师光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    这一批被批准为中国共产党预备党员的高级知识分子，都曾经受到历次政治运动的锻炼，较好地进行了思想改造，政治学习也比较认真，在整风、反右派斗争中都能站在工人阶级立场上维护党的利益。南京农学院土壤农化系主任黄瑞采平常除了积极钻研业务外，还能紧密依靠党和群众，努力提高自己的阶级觉悟，在右派分子向党进攻的日子里，他自己没有迷失方向，能够及时分辨是非，识破右派分子的阴谋。曾担任南京农学院总务长的刘伊农教授，当右派分子污蔑他“有职无权”，煽动他向党进攻的时候，他用党信任他的种种事实驳斥了右派分子；以后在反右派斗争中，又在校内和校外收集材料对右派分子进行驳斥。南京航空学院讲师薛秋农，解放后曾几次申请入党，在比较长的时期中接受党的考察，积极工作始终不懈。在整风、反右派斗争中，薛秋农站在党的立场上，用新旧社会的对比和解放后几年来亲眼看到的社会主义建设成就，教育群众，驳斥了右派分子的造谣污蔑，同右派分子进行了坚决的斗争，运动中第三次申请入党，光荣地得到批准。
    现在，这些预备党员正在积极争取参加体力劳动，学习政治，要把自己进一步锻炼成为又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子。
