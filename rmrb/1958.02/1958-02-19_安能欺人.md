    How Can One Deceive People?
    The U.S. government has decided to conduct a series of nuclear tests in the Pacific region from April to the summer this year and has declared 390,000 square nautical miles of the high seas around Eniwetok Atoll as a danger zone. This is another instance of the United States acting unilaterally despite the strong protests of the Asian people. Compared with the Soviet Union's repeated proposals to stop nuclear weapon tests, doesn't this activity of the United States continuing to intensify the nuclear arms race expose its warmongering policy even more? Shouldn't this be exposed and mobilize people all over the world to attack it? However, U.S. officials have recently been creating a kind of argument, viciously saying that anyone who exposes its war preparations and aggressive activities lacks sincerity in promoting "peace." This method of confusing right and wrong is really not clever enough.

    安能欺人
    美国政府决定从今年4月起一直到夏季要在太平洋地区进行一系列的核试验，竟宣布恩纳威托克岛周围三十九万平方海里的公海为危险区。这是美国又一次不顾亚洲人民的强烈抗议，在一意孤行。美国这种继续加紧核军备竞赛的活动，比起苏联一再建议停止核武器试验来，不正是更加暴露了它的好战政策吗？这难道不应该予以揭发，动员全世界人民群起而攻之吗？可是，美国官方最近却在制造一种论调，恶毒地说：一切揭发它的备战和侵略活动的人，都是对促进“和平”没有诚意。这种混淆是非的手法，实在太不高明了。
