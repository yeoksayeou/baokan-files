　　Spending Money Ineffectively and Receiving No Appreciation
　　Jiuquan
　　I completely agree with Comrade Ren Hui's opinion published in this column on January 13 regarding a scene in "Woman Basketball Player No. 5." This is an important opinion, so I want to promote it further.
　　Although "Woman Basketball Player No. 5" still has some artistic shortcomings, it is indeed a good film. I saw it relatively late and regretted not seeing it sooner... After watching it, I said to myself, "Our film art has really made great progress!" However, on the other hand, I still felt that some plot arrangements were not very appropriate, but not to the point of causing aversion. It wasn't until I saw Lin Xiaoqing return to Suzhou from Shanghai to visit her mother, that is, when the splendid set mentioned by Comrade Ren Hui appeared before my eyes, that I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable. Suddenly, the mood that had been focused on the plot was completely broken. Lin Jie, this female teacher who supports herself after her divorce, actually lives in such a luxurious bedroom! The tables, chairs, and other furnishings are all very exquisite. And those carved door frames appear to be made of valuable wood. I was born in Suzhou, and in my impression, only the mansions of a few big landlords, gentry, and bureaucrats in the past could have such rooms, so-called "flower halls," or the buildings in those famous gardens. This set could never be associated with the concept of a female teacher's bedroom. What was equally disharmonious and jarring was the set of pajamas that Lin Jie was wearing. A female comrade said that it was the latest style. In short, the things that appeared on the screen, as "beautiful" as they were, were completely divorced from the story's era (from after the victory against Japan to before liberation) and the character's identity. Seeing this, I no longer felt that this was a character in the play, but immediately thought that this was an actor, this was acting, this was exaggerated, this was designed for the scene to "look good," this was arranged for shooting a color film... and so on.
　　If we are talking about "beautifying life," weren't the lives of teachers before liberation struggling on the starvation line, just like other working people? How could it be "beautified"? And why should we "beautify" it? Even for the people's lives after liberation, as Comrade Ren Hui said, in art, they should be reflected with realistic images, not for the sake of scenery, for the sake of furnishings, not to deviate from the purpose of ideological education and the angle of artistic truth.
　　According to reports, there are quite a few such things in the film industry that waste state resources and reduce the quality of the films, things that cost money and are ineffective. For example, building a dance hall costing more than 3,000 yuan, only to have the shot not suitable and be cut; a female nurse going to a difficult construction site changing twenty-four sets of elaborate clothes; a scientist's building set costing 6,000 yuan, but in reality, only the wealthiest capitalists would live in such a house.
　　I once heard a saying that American film bosses have a secret to making films that guarantees they can make money (earn the money of upwardly mobile petty-bourgeois audiences), called: "Show them what the wealthy class looks like!" Thus, the films are filled with scenes of eating, drinking, playing, luxury, waste, extravagance, and grandeur. Bourgeois art also has the purpose of "ideological education," which is to poison the audience's ideology, make them envy the lifestyle of the bourgeoisie, lose their ambition, become corrupt and degenerate, and take the capitalist road.
　　Our film's purpose is, of course, completely different. We want to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. We want to educate the audience to recognize the ugliness of the bourgeoisie and the decline of the capitalist system. We want to educate the audience to take the socialist road and establish the atmosphere of diligence, simplicity, and frugality. Any decadent and harmful artistic viewpoints and styles are incompatible with our socialist film art. Of course, the ideological factors that cause this shortcoming in our films cannot be simply and generally equated with the kind of antagonistic artistic viewpoints mentioned above, especially the purpose of production is fundamentally different. The nature of the problem needs to be further explored. But, in any case, the question of what is beautiful has also changed with the transformation of the times and society.

　　费钱不讨好
　　酒泉
    1月13日任晦同志在本版发表的关于“女篮五号”中一堂布景的意见，我完全同意。这是一个重要的意见，所以我想再把它宣传一下。
    “女篮五号”尽管在艺术上还是有缺点，的确是部好影片。我看得较晚，当时有点懊悔看得迟了……完看之后，我这样对自己说：“我国的电影艺术真是有了很大的进步啊！”但是另一方面，对于某些情节的安排，也还是感到不大妥贴，不过不至于引起反感。只是等到看到林小洁从上海回苏州去看她母亲时，也就是任晦同志所说的那堂华丽的布景呈现在眼前时，才不禁感到不舒服，一下子原来贯注在剧情里的心情完全出了戏。林洁，这位离婚后独自维持生计的女教师，竟住在这样一间华丽的卧室里！无论桌椅和其他陈设都是十分讲究的。还有那些雕花的门框，看来是一种贵重的木料做的。我出生在苏州，在我的印象里，只有过去的少数大地主、绅士、官僚的大宅子里，才可能有这样的房间，所谓“花厅”之类，再不然就是那些著名的园林里的建筑了。这堂布景决不可能和一位女教师的卧室这个概念联系得起来。同样使人觉得不调和而且刺眼的是林洁身上穿的那套睡衣，一位女同志说，这是最新式的一种。总之，银幕上出现的东西，“美”则“美”矣，却和故事的时代（抗战胜利之后到解放之前）以及人物的身份，完全脱节。看到这里，我再也不觉得这是剧中人物，而是立刻想到这是演员，这是演戏，这是夸张了的，这是为了场面“好看”而设计的，这是为了拍彩色影片而布置的……等等。
    说是“美化生活”吧，解放前一般教员的生活还不是挣扎在饥饿线上，和其他劳动人民一样吗？怎么“美化”得了？又凭什么要去“美化”它？即使是解放以后的人民生活，正如任晦同志说的，在艺术中，也应该用真实的形象来反映，不应该为布景而布景，为陈设而陈设，不应该离开思想教育的目的和艺术真实的角度来考虑问题。
    据报道，电影方面的这一类既浪费国家资财也降低影片质量的、费钱不讨好的事情，是不算少的。什么搭一个舞厅，花三千多元，结果镜头不适用而被剪掉；什么一位到艰苦的工地去的女护士，前后换了二十四套讲究的衣服；什么一位科学家的楼房的布景花了六千元，可是在现实生活中只有最阔气的资本家才会住这样的房子。
    过去听说过这样一句话，美国的电影老板有一条制片的秘诀，保证可以赚钱（赚向上爬的小资产阶级观众的钱），叫做：“把富豪阶级的样子表现给他们看！”于是片子里充满了吃喝玩乐、奢侈浪费、豪华阔绰、富丽堂皇的场面布景。资产阶级的艺术也是有“思想教育”的目的的，就是要毒化观众的思想意识，让他们羡慕资产阶级的生活方式，丧失志气，腐化堕落，走资本主义的道路。
    我们的电影的目的当然完全不同，我们要兴无灭资，我们要教育观众认识资产阶级的丑恶和资本主义制度的没落；我们要教育观众走社会主义道路，树立勤俭、朴素和节约的风气。任何陈腐的有害的艺术观点和作风是和我们的社会主义电影艺术不相容的。当然，造成我们电影里的这个缺点的思想因素和上面所提到的那种敌对的艺术观点，决不能简单化地、一概而论地加以等同，特别是制片的目的性，当然是根本不同的。问题的性质有待于进一步的探讨。但是，不管怎样，什么才是美的这个问题，也随着时代、社会的转变而有所转变了。
