I completely agree with and resolutely support Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 national budget and the draft 1958 national budget, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft 1958 national economic plan, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on current language reform work and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. I will actively implement them in future practical work.

Now, I would like to report to the conference on the experiences of Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province regarding the pilot establishment of pastoral cooperatives and public-private partnership pastoral farms. I welcome any criticisms and corrections from the delegates.

　　Pastoral Cooperatives Showed Superiority, Increased Production and Increased Members' Income

Our people in Haibei Autonomous Prefecture suffered extremely cruel oppression and exploitation under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. There was no way to talk about developing animal husbandry. However, the situation has fundamentally changed since liberation. Due to the active and steady implementation of the Chinese Communist Party's policies in pastoral areas, such as "no struggle, no division," "no class division," "mutual benefit for herdsmen and owners," and "freedom of religious belief," we have achieved great success in our work. Especially in the pilot work of establishing pastoral cooperatives and public-private partnership pastoral farms, we resolutely implemented the principle of "voluntary entry, free withdrawal" and related measures. After more than two years of hard work, we trained and developed cooperative cadres and overcame difficulties by relying on the masses, which greatly demonstrated the superiority of pastoral collectivization. My experience is:

　　I. Significantly Increased Production and Increased Members' Income. This is an important aspect of the superiority of pastoral collectivization. Judging from the income distribution, the net income of the five pastoral cooperatives in Sujitan in 1957 increased by 50% compared to 1956, of which the first cooperative increased by 55.29%, the second cooperative increased by 48.27%, the third cooperative increased by 33.45%, the fourth cooperative increased by 35.94%, and the fifth cooperative increased by 105% (due to disaster and reduced production in 1956); Yongfeng Cooperative increased by 44.4%; Sujitan Public-Private Partnership Pastoral Farm increased by 101.9%; therefore, more than 95% of households increased their income. This has played a great role in consolidating and developing the cooperative (farm) and carrying out socialist education.

　　Main Reasons for Increased Production

　　II. Main reasons for increased production:

　　(1) Improved feeding and management, improved breeding techniques. Based on the entire cooperative (farm), the following work was emphasized:

　　(1) According to the principles of being conducive to feeding and management and enhancing the physical fitness of livestock, the past situation of mixed grazing was changed to classifying livestock by size, strength, weakness, male, and female, and grazing in separate groups, and gradually formed a system. In this way, accidental losses such as miscarriages caused by crowding in the original mixed grazing were avoided. At the same time, all kinds of livestock can be fed adequately.

　　(2) The grazing method of following the herd was implemented, requiring reasonable use of grassland and planned use of pasture according to seasons and regions, and caring about livestock's drinking water and grazing. This has enhanced the physical fitness of livestock and the survival rate of young livestock. For example, the lamb survival rate of the five cooperatives in Sujitan in 1957 increased by 61.6% compared to 1956, 13.6% more than mutual aid teams, and 23% more than individual households.

　　(3) Each cooperative newly built and repaired livestock pens on the basis of the original livestock pens. The requirement of livestock having pens was basically achieved, which played a great role in preventing disasters such as wind, snow, and wolves.

　　(4) Cutting and storing pasture and planting forage grass, and supplementing feed for old and weak livestock, so that they can safely spend the winter and spring seasons.

　　(5) Implementing artificial feeding of lambs. Lambing bags, warm sheds, and artificial feeders were prepared before lambing, which played a good role in protecting young livestock.

　　(2) Implementing the principle of "running cooperatives diligently and frugally" and "deducting less and distributing more" saved cooperative expenses and increased the income of the vast majority of members. For example, in the preliminary distribution plan of Sujitan Cooperative, deducting expenses and public accumulation accounted for 16.2% of the total income, and the remaining 83.8% was distributed to the members. The public-private partnership farm also implemented these principles.

　　(3) Developing diversified operations is an important reason for increasing income within the cooperative. Pastoral cooperatives and public-private partnership pastoral farms also engaged in agriculture and sideline production according to local conditions. This income accounted for a considerable proportion. For example, in Sujitan General Cooperative, agricultural income accounted for 15.1% of the total income. Sideline income accounted for 5.9% of the total income, and income from herding livestock accounted for 10.83%.

　　(4) Vigorously carry out veterinary epidemic prevention work to ensure the smooth development of livestock. Inject anthrax vaccine into cattle and horses in spring, sheep fast vaccine in summer, and septicemia vaccine in autumn. For example, Yongfeng Pastoral Cooperative injected 501 horses, 531 cattle, and 667 sheep. This played a great role in reducing abnormal deaths and increasing the survival rate of young livestock.

　　(5) Improving livestock breeds and changing random mating to selective mating. According to the situation of female livestock in the cooperative (farm), generally, one breeding male was retained for every 25 sheep, 20 cattle, and 20 horses. For example, Sujitan Fifth Cooperative selected and retained good-wool and strong-bodied local breeding males. Last year, the conception rate of sheep was not empty; the conception rate of cattle and horses increased to 90%; two thousand pure white ewes in the cooperative were hybridized with Xinjiang sheep, which not only increased the conception rate but also greatly improved the breed.

The above five points are the main reasons for the increase in production within the cooperative, and also illustrate the superiority of pastoral collectivization in these aspects. Because these factors for increasing production are based on socialist collective labor and mutual assistance and cooperation, and are constantly developing. This combines their current interests with the bright future of socialism, using practical actions such as loving the cooperative as home, uniting and helping each other, and actively producing, to build the socialist cause.

　　Promoted Settled Nomadism and Changed the Face of Pastoral Areas

　　III. On the basis of the pilot pastoral cooperatives (farms), more favorable conditions for settled nomadism were promoted. In the past, most herdsmen in Sujitan lived by moving with water and grass, living a purely nomadic life, often suffering from wind and frost, easily contracting diseases, and women had low fertility. After liberation, due to the advocacy of the Party and the government, and the development of pastoral production and pastoral mutual aid and cooperation, the conditions for settled nomadism gradually matured. From 1954 to 1957, the settled herdsmen in Sujitan have achieved remarkable results, building a total of 183 houses, and 71 herdsmen's households have settled down, accounting for 50% of the total number of herdsmen's households in the township. Two schools, supply and marketing cooperatives, district veterinary technology stations, township people's committees, and the headquarters of the public-private partnership farm were built in the settlement, and more than 700 mu of feed bases were also opened up. The practice of settled nomadism proves that it can better develop animal husbandry production and continuously improve the material and cultural life of herdsmen. Our promotion of settled nomadism is a new task. My initial experience is: First, we must lead herdsmen to vigorously develop pastoral production and pastoral mutual aid and cooperation, so as to better create favorable conditions for settled nomadism. Because the vast majority of herdsmen who actively respond to settled nomadism have participated in pastoral mutual aid and cooperation. In 1957, 22 of the 24 households settled in winter pens in Shang and Xiawan Village were members of cooperatives. Secondly, under the conditions of settlement, agriculture and animal husbandry should be gradually promoted to improve the lives of herdsmen and strengthen the feeding and management of livestock. As a result of settlement in Sujitan in recent years, the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry has been formed. For example, the grain harvested by the Second Branch in 1957 can supply the members of the entire cooperative for half a year; the forage grass planted by the farm and cooperative can basically meet the needs. In addition to their own use, some of the feed planted by some cooperatives can also be sold to the state. Facts have proved that this is an important measure to change the face of pastoral areas. In the future, we plan to reclaim some more wasteland, and combine it with developing chicken raising, pig raising, and afforestation.

In the process of piloting pastoral cooperatives and farms, we encountered many difficulties, but under the correct leadership of the Party, we actively implemented the guidelines, policies, and all measures of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on piloting pastoral cooperatives and farms, relying on cooperative cadres and herdsmen, and on the basis of strengthening national unity, we obtained the sympathy and support of local ethnic representatives and religious circles. Therefore, we overcame the difficulties in our work and achieved great results. Facts have proved that the success of piloting pastoral cooperatives and farms has pointed out the correct direction for the people in pastoral areas, and any doubts are unfounded. We must not waver our steps and established guidelines for the socialist transformation of animal husbandry because of some shortcomings caused by the lack of experience in the initial establishment of the cooperative, as well as the opposition of certain backward elements. The correct attitude is to stand in front of the people, believe in the Party, believe in the masses, have revolutionary vigor, overcome all difficulties, promote a high tide of pastoral production, and resolutely complete the glorious tasks of 1958!

　　办牧业合作社和公私合营牧场是牧业区人民群众的正确方向
    夏茸尕布代表谈海北藏族自治州试办牧业合作社和公私合营牧场的体会
    我完全同意并坚决拥护李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告与薄一波副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告，以及彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告、吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告等。今后在实际工作中，积极贯彻执行。
    现在我把青海省海北藏族自治州关于试办牧业合作社和公私合营牧场的工作体会，向大会汇报，不妥之处，请各位代表提出批评指正。
    牧业合作社显示了优越性  增加生产增加了社员收入
    我们海北自治州的人民，过去在国民党反动统治下，受着极残酷的压迫和剥削，是谈不到发展畜牧业问题的。但是从解放以后，情况就根本改变了。由于积极稳步地贯彻了中国共产党在牧业区的“不斗不分”、“不划阶级”、
  “牧工牧主两利”和“宗教信仰自由”等政策，因而在工作上取得了很大成绩。特别在试办牧业合作社和公私合营牧场的工作上，我们坚决贯彻了“入社自愿、退社自由”的原则和有关措施，经过二年多的艰苦努力，培养与锻炼了办社干部，依靠群众克服了困难，就大大显示了牧业合作化的优越性。我的体会是：
    一、显著地增加了生产、增加了社员的收入。这是牧业合作化的优越性的一个重要方面。从收益分配情况来看，苏吉滩五个牧业社一九五七年比一九五六年的纯收入增加了百分之五十，其中一社增加百分之五十五点二九，二社增加百分之四十八点二七，三社增加百分之三十三点四五，四社增加百分之三十五点九四，五社增加百分之一百零五（因一九五六年受灾减产）；永丰社增加百分之四十四点四；苏吉滩公私合营牧场增加百分之一百零一点九；因此，有百分之九十五以上的户都增加了收入。这对于社（场）的巩固、发展和进行社会主义教育都起到了很大作用。
    增加生产的主要原因
    二、增产的主要原因：
    （一）改进了饲放管理，提高了饲养技术，在整社（场）的基础上，重视进行了以下工作：
    （1）根据有利于饲放管理和增强牲畜体质的原则，把过去混合放牧的情况，改为按牲畜大、小、强、弱、公、母编类分群放牧的方法，并且逐步形成了制度。这样，就避免了原先合群放牧因为拥挤造成流产等意外损失。同时，各类牲畜都能吃饱。
    （2）实行了跟群走圈的放牧方法，要求作到合理地使用草山，有计划地分季节分地区地利用牧草，关心牲畜的喝水、吃草。这就增强了牲畜的体质和幼畜的成活率。如苏吉滩五个社的羊羔成活率一九五七年比一九五六年增多百分之六十一点六，比互助组多百分之十三点六，比单干户多百分之二十三。
    （3）各社在原有畜圈的基础上，都新修和补修了畜圈。基本上达到了牲畜有圈的要求，对防御风、雪、狼等灾害，起了很大的作用。
    （4）割贮牧草、种植饲草，对老弱牲畜实行补饲，使它们安全地度过冬、春季节。
    （5）实行接羔人工哺乳的办法，在接羔前准备接羔袋和暖棚、人工哺乳器等，这对保护幼畜起了很好的作用。
    （二）贯彻了“勤俭办社”、“少扣多分”的原则，节约了社的开支，使绝大多数社员都增加了收入。如苏吉滩社，在预分方案中，扣除开支和公共积累占总收入的百分之十六点二以外，其余百分之八十三点八都分给社员。公私合营牧场同样贯彻了这些原则。
    （三）开展多种经营是增加社内收入的一个重要原因。牧业社和公私合营牧场根据当地条件，兼营农业和副业。这项收入占相当大的比重。例如，苏吉滩总社，农业收入占总收入的百分之十五点一。副业收入占总收入的百分之五点九，带放牲畜收入占百分之十点八三。
    （四）大力开展兽疫防治工作，使牲畜顺利发展。春季给牛、马注射炭疽疫苗，夏季注射羊快疫苗，秋季注射败血症疫苗。如永丰牧业社，共注射马五百零一匹、牛五百三十一头、羊六百六十七只。这对减少不正常的死亡和提高幼畜的成活率，都起了很大作用。
    （五）改良牲畜的品种，把乱配改为选配。根据社（场）内母畜情况，一般按羊二十五只、牛二十头、马二十匹的比例，留一只公种畜。如苏吉滩五社选留了毛好体强的土种公畜，去年羊的受胎率没有空胎；牛、马的受胎率提高到百分之九十；社内二千只纯白母羊同新疆羊杂交，不仅提高了受胎率，也大大改良了品种。
    以上五条是社内增产的主要原因，同时也在这几方面说明了牧业合作化的优越性。因为这些增产的因素，是建立在社会主义的集体劳动、互助合作的基础上，而不断向前发展的。这就把他们的目前利益和社会主义的光明前途，用爱社如爱家、团结互助、积极生产等实际行动和建设社会主义事业结合起来了。
    促进了定居游牧  改变了牧区面貌
    三、在试办牧业社（场）的工作基础上，更加促进了定居游牧的有利条件。苏吉滩过去大多数牧民逐水草而居，过着纯游牧生活，常受风霜之苦，容易传染疾病，妇女生育力低。解放后，由于党和政府的提倡，和牧业生产及牧业互助合作的发展，定居游牧的条件就逐步成熟了。从一九五四年到一九五七年，苏吉滩定居的牧民已经取得显著的成绩，共修建房屋一百八十三间，七十一户牧民已经定居下来，占全乡总牧户的百分之五十，定居点上修建了两处学校和供销社、区兽疫技术站、乡人民委员会、公私合营牧场场部，还开辟了饲料基地七百多亩。定居游牧的实践证明：可以更好地发展畜牧业生产和不断地提高牧民的物质和文化生活。我们推行定居游牧是一件新的工作，我的初步体会是：首先必须领导牧民大力发展牧业生产和牧业互助合作，以便更好地创造定居游牧的有利条件。因为积极响应定居游牧的牧户绝大多数是参加了牧业互助合作的。一九五七年上、下湾村定居冬圈的二十四户中，社内占二十二户。其次，应该在定居的条件下，逐步推行农牧结合，以改善牧民生活、加强牲畜的饲养管理。苏吉滩几年来定居的结果，农牧结合已经形成。如二分社一九五七年收获的粮食可供给全社社员半年之用；场社种植的饲草基本上可以满足需要。有的社所种的饲料除自用外，还可以出售给国家一部分。事实证明这是改变牧业区面貌的一项重要措施。今后还计划再开垦一部分荒地，结合开展养鸡、养猪及植树造林等工作。
    我们在试办牧业社场的工作过程中，遇到过不少困难，但是在党的正确领导下，积极地贯彻执行了中共青海省委关于试办牧业社、场的方针、政策和一切措施，依靠办社干部和牧民群众，在加强民族团结的基础上，取得当地民族代表人物和宗教界的同情和赞助，所以克服了工作中的困难，获得了巨大的成绩。事实证明：试办牧业社、场的成功，向牧业区人民群众指出了正确的方向，任何怀疑都是没有根据的。不能因为初办社时缺少经验所产生的一些缺点，以及某些落后分子的反对，而动摇我们对于畜牧业必须实行社会主义改造的步骤和既定方针。正确的态度，是站在人民群众的前面，相信党相信群众，要有革命干劲，克服一切困难，促进牧业生产高潮，要坚决完成一九五八年的光荣任务！
