Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 2nd: Over three million two hundred and seventy-nine thousand people in North Korea have signed petitions by January 30th demanding a ban on the production and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, opposing the establishment of atomic weapon bases by the United States in South Korea, and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea.

This nationwide signature campaign was launched on December 27th, following a resolution made at the Second Congress of the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland in December of last year. People from all walks of life in North Korea enthusiastically participated in the signing. Masses participating in the signing in factories, schools, government offices, streets, and rural areas also held gatherings, posted wall newspapers, propaganda posters, and slogans, condemning the United States for establishing atomic bases in South Korea and the atrocities of U.S. troops in South Korea. The criminal act of the U.S. military in Korea recently further violating the armistice agreement by transporting atomic weapons into South Korea has aroused great anger.

Han Can-chun, a train driver from the Pyongyang Locomotive Depot, said after signing that the U.S. imperialists must immediately get out of South Korea; Korea belongs to the Korean people. He also expressed that in order to contribute to the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, he would overfulfill this year's transportation plan. Dong Yixiang, a construction worker from the Pyongyang First Construction Company whose husband was killed by U.S. aircraft during the war, said after signing that we Korean people know what kind of disasters war will bring to the people; we will never allow the U.S. imperialists to provoke war again. One-third of the construction workers in this construction company have families in South Korea, and they all participated in the signing; they expressed their firm opposition to the U.S. military establishing atomic bases in their hometown, condemned the atrocities of the U.S. military in South Korea, and demanded the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

    这个全民性的签名运动是根据去年12月朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线第二次大会作出的决议，从去年12月27日起开展起来的。朝鲜北部各界人民热烈参加了签名。各工厂、学校、机关、街道和农村中参加签名的群众还纷纷举行集会，张贴壁报、宣传画和标语，谴责美国在南朝鲜建立原子基地和美军在南朝鲜的暴行。侵朝美军最近进一步违反停战协定把原子武器运入南朝鲜的罪恶行为引起了人们极大的愤怒。
    平壤机务段的火车司机韩赞淳在签名以后说，美帝国主义者必须立即从南朝鲜滚出去，朝鲜是属于朝鲜人民的。他还表示，为了对和平统一祖国作出贡献，他要超额完成今年的运输计划。战争时期丈夫被美国飞机炸死的平壤第一建筑公司建筑工人董义香在签名以后说，我们朝鲜人民知道战争将给人民带来什么样的灾难；我们决不容许美帝国主义再挑起战争。这个建筑公司的三分之一的建筑工人，家在南朝鲜，他们都参加了签名；他们表示坚决反对美军在他们的家乡建立原子基地，谴责美军在南朝鲜的暴行，要求和平统一祖国。
