　　Agricultural production's great leap forward requires revolutionary zeal, as well as the help of science and technology. The broad masses of peasants eagerly expect teachers and students of agricultural schools and agricultural science workers to go deep into the fields to help them summarize production experience, improve production experience, and strengthen technical guidance, so as to quickly realize a great leap forward in agricultural production. Striving to meet the urgent demands of the broad masses of peasants is the unshirkable responsibility of teachers and students of agricultural schools and agricultural science workers. Northwest Agricultural College is doing just that. For the past three years, this school has consistently maintained close contact with agricultural cooperatives, helping farmers summarize and improve production experience and imparting scientific technology, thereby promoting the development of agricultural production and receiving warm welcome from farmers.
    The benefits of close contact between teachers and students of agricultural schools and scientific research workers and agricultural cooperatives are not only that it can promote a great leap forward in agricultural production, but more importantly, it changes the teaching method of separating theory from practice. Leaving the classroom and entering the fields truly makes them agricultural schools worthy of the name. Doing so enriches the teaching content for teachers, and enriches the learning content for students. This is a good way to link theory with practice, and it is also the fundamental path to cultivating socialist construction talents who are both red and expert.
    Agricultural colleges and universities connect with agricultural cooperatives to help the development of agricultural production; conversely, agricultural cooperatives help agricultural colleges and universities improve the quality of teaching. This is a win-win approach for both parties.
    Regrettably, the benefits of these two aspects are not deeply understood by all teachers and students of agricultural colleges and universities and agricultural science workers. For example, there is such an agricultural school in Yunnan Province. In the past, this school was seriously divorced from reality and the masses, and did not proceed from the characteristics of the region. For example, Yunnan plants winter wheat, but the teachers lecture on spring wheat. There are no locusts in Yunnan at all, but in order to meet the "national unified standard," the school takes locust control as the focus of its lectures. Some teachers say, "Agricultural cooperatives are too backward." What is the basis for this? Because there are no tractors and no electrification equipment, and it cannot meet the requirements of teaching practice, so "agricultural cooperatives are too backward."
    What kind of view is this? Leaving aside the actual situation of one's hometown, not combining with production, and despising practice, this is the bourgeois teaching view. It is conceivable that the talents cultivated by people who hold this view will hardly truly understand agriculture. We must correct this erroneous view and cure this disease. There is no magic cure for this disease, only combining with practice. All teachers and students of agricultural schools, and all agricultural science research workers, must be able to contact nearby agricultural production cooperatives, make friends with farmers, and be both teachers and students of farmers. In this way, we will surely see that not only will agricultural production make a great leap forward, but the quality of school teaching work will also make a great leap forward.

　　农业学校的教学工作也需要大跃进
　　祖年
    农业生产大跃进需要革命干劲，还需要科学技术的帮助。广大农民迫切期望农业学校的师生和农业科学工作者深入田间，帮助他们总结生产经验，提高生产经验，加强技术指导，以便迅速地实现农业生产大跃进。努力满足广大农民这种迫切要求，是农业学校师生和农业科学工作者义不容辞的职责。西北农学院正是这样做了。三年来，这个学校一直坚持同农业社密切联系，帮助农民总结和提高生产经验，传授科学技术，从而促进了农业生产的发展，受到了农民的热烈欢迎。
    农业学校师生、科学研究工作者同农业社密切联系的好处，不仅是可以促进农业生产大跃进，而更重要的是，改变了理论脱离实际的教学方法，走出课堂，进入田间，真正成为名符其实的农业学校。这样做，对教师来说，教学内容丰富了；对学生来说，学习内容丰富了。这是理论联系实际的好办法，也是培养又红又专的社会主义建设人才的根本道路。
    农业院校联系农业社，帮助农业生产发展；反过来，农业社又帮助农业院校提高教学质量。这是一种双方都有好处的做法。
    值得惋惜的是，这两个方面的好处，并不是为所有农业院校师生和农业科学工作者深刻了解。举例来说，在云南省就有这样一所农业学校。这个学校过去严重地脱离实际，脱离群众，不从地区的特点出发。如云南种的是冬小麦，而教师讲的是春小麦。云南根本没有飞蝗，但为了“全国统一标准”，学校却把防治飞蝗当作讲授的重点。有的教员说，“农业社太落后”。根据何在呢？因为没有拖拉机，没有电气化设备，不能满足教学实习的要求，所以“农业社太落后”了。
    这是一种什么观点呢？离开了本乡本土的实际情况，不同生产结合，轻视实践，这就是资产阶级的教学观点。持有这种观点的人，可想而知，培养出来的人材是很难真正懂得农业的。我们必须纠正这个错误观点，治好这种病。要治好这种病，别无良方妙药，只有结合实际。所有的农业学校师生，所有的农业科学研究工作者，都要能联系附近的农业生产合作社，同农民交上朋友，既做农民的先生，又做农民的学生。这样一来，我们定会看到，不仅农业生产会大跃进，学校教学工作的质量也会大跃进。
