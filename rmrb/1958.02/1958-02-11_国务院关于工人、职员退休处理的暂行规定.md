    Article 5 Workers and staff who are disabled due to work-related injuries, and have been determined by the labor appraisal committee or certified by a doctor as having completely lost their ability to work, should also retire. The treatment after retirement will still be handled in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Labor Insurance Regulations in enterprises that implement the Labor Insurance Regulations; in enterprises and organs that do not implement the Labor Insurance Regulations, the retirement pension will be 75% of their wages per month for those who need assistance with their diet and daily life, and 60% of their wages per month for those who do not need assistance with their diet and daily life, until the time of their death.

    Article 10 The wages mentioned in these regulations refer to the time-based wage standard of the worker or staff member in the last month before retirement. For workers and staff who already met the retirement conditions listed in Article 2 of these regulations before the promulgation of these regulations, but were not retired at that time and only transferred to lighter work and had their wages reduced, the time-based wage standard of the last month before the transfer shall be used for calculation; if the work has been transferred more than once during the period after meeting the retirement conditions, the time-based wage standard of the last month before the first transfer shall be used for calculation.
    Article 11 The retirement of workers and staff shall be decided by the enterprise or organ administration and implemented after obtaining the consent of the trade union at the same level. If a leader is retiring, it must also be reported to the appointment and dismissal authority for approval.
    The calculation of working years for retirement, the determination of retirement treatment standards, and the issuance of retirement certificates shall be handled by the personnel department of the enterprise or organ in conjunction with the trade union at the same level.
    Article 12 The various expenses stipulated to be paid shall be paid from the labor insurance fund in enterprises that implement labor insurance. If the labor insurance fund of the unit is insufficient, it can be adjusted within the province, autonomous region, municipality directly under the Central Government, or the industrial system. If it is still insufficient, the difference shall be paid by the unit administration. In enterprises that do not implement labor insurance, all the above expenses shall be paid by the enterprise administration; in institutions, state organs, and people's organizations, all shall be paid by the county-level civil affairs department where the retired person resides, in a separate budget.
    Article 13 These regulations also apply to teachers, staff, and workers of schools, workers and staff of supply and marketing cooperatives, and workers and staff without military status working in the army; however, they do not apply to personnel of handicraft production cooperatives, transportation cooperatives, and private-public joint ventures with undetermined interest.
    Article 14 These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation. The "Provisional Measures of the State Council on the Handling of Retirement of Staff of State Organs" shall be repealed simultaneously, and the "Labor Insurance Regulations" promulgated by the former Government Administration Council that conflict with these regulations shall be implemented in accordance with these regulations. However, personnel who have retired in the past and continue to receive retirement pensions shall continue to enjoy the treatment according to the original standards.
    Article 15 The implementing rules of these regulations shall be formulated and promulgated for implementation by the Ministry of Labor and the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government.

    第十一条　工人、职员退休，由企业、机关行政决定，取得同级工会同意以后执行。如果是领导人员退休，还必须报送任免机关批准。
    有关退休的工龄计算，退休待遇标准的确定，填发退休人员证明书等工作，由企业、机关的人事部门会同同级工会办理。
    第十二条　规定发给的各项费用，在实行劳动保险的企业单位，退休费、丧葬补助费和亲属抚恤费，由劳动保险基金中支付，如果本单位的劳动保险基金不敷开支，可以在本省、自治区、直辖市或者本产业系统内进行调剂，仍然不足的时候，差额部分由本单位行政支付。在没有实行劳动保险的企业单位，上述各项费用，全部由企业行政支付；在事业单位、国家机关和人民团体，全部由退休人员居住地方的县级民政部门另列预算支付。

    第十四条　本规定自发布之日起施行。国务院发布的“国家机关工作人员退休处理暂行办法”同时废止，前政务院发布的“劳动保险条例”与本规定有抵触的，按照本规定执行。但是，过去已经退休现在继续领取退休费的人员，仍然按照原来的标准享受待遇。
    第十五条　本规定的实施细则，分别由劳动部和省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会制定发布施行。
