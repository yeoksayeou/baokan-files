Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yongho, and his wife held a grand reception in Beijing tonight to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army.

Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense, and General Su Yu, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, attended the reception.

In his speech at the reception, Ambassador Li Yongho said that over the past ten years, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, the Korean People's Army has resolutely defended the revolutionary achievements of our people. Especially during the three-year Fatherland Liberation War, the Korean People's Army, the Korean people, and the Chinese People's Volunteers fought shoulder to shoulder, displaying a high degree of patriotism and collective heroism, defeating the armed aggression of the US imperialist army and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, defending the freedom, independence, and happiness of the motherland, and making contributions to the great cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Ambassador Li Yongho said that the US imperialists and their running dogs, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, who continue to occupy South Korea, are still trying every possible way to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, grossly violating the armistice agreement, and are turning South Korea into an aggressive atomic base. He said that in light of the current situation in our country, on February 5 this year, the Korean government, representing the will of the entire Korean people, once again issued a statement clarifying the reasonable proposals for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, such as the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and the implementation of free elections throughout Korea. The entire Korean people are united and fighting for its realization.

Marshal Peng Dehuai spoke at the meeting. He said that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean People's Army has bravely completed the glorious tasks entrusted to it. After the Korean armistice, the Korean People's Army has steadfastly defended Korea's peaceful labor and socialist construction. At the same time, it has also achieved brilliant achievements in strengthening the building of the army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is heartily delighted with every achievement and victory of the fraternal Korean People's Army.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that two days ago, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued an important statement on the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Chinese government also issued a statement, fully agreeing with and supporting this major peace initiative of the Korean government. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army fully support the above statement. However, recently US imperialism is still continuing to create tension in the Far East, openly violating the armistice agreement, transporting atomic weapons into South Korea, and conducting provocative atomic assault exercises near the demilitarized zone. This is a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world, and should arouse our high vigilance. The Chinese people will continue to fight resolutely together with the Korean people and the people of the world for the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea and for the consolidation of peace in Asia and the world.

Also attending the reception were Senior General Li Da, Senior General Zhang Zongxun, Senior General Xiao Hua, Senior General Gan Siqi, Senior General Hong Xuezhi, Senior General Yang Chengwu, Senior General Deng Hua, Air Force Senior General Liu Yalou, Senior General Chen Shiju, Senior General Li Zhimin, Senior General Song Shilun, and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as officers of the army, navy, and air force stationed in Beijing. Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, also attended the reception.

Diplomatic envoys and military attaches of various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: The Korean Embassy in China held a medal presentation ceremony in Beijing at 3:00 pm today. Ambassador Li Yongho, entrusted by the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, awarded the Order of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and medals to a total of thirty-nine Chinese technicians and scientific personnel who had participated in the post-war economic recovery and construction work in Korea and made meritorious contributions and have now returned to China.

At the medal presentation ceremony, Wen Zaizhu, Counselor of the Korean Embassy in China, read out the decree of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on awarding the Republic's medals and decorations to Chinese technicians and scientific personnel who participated in the work of restoring and constructing Korea. Amidst warm applause, Ambassador Li Yongho personally pinned the Third-Class National Flag Order on the chests of the recipients, Lu Zhao, Wang Yunxuan, and Chen Liwei. The twenty-seven Third-Class National Flag Orders and nine Service Medals, as well as the medal certificates and award certificates, for the remaining thirty-six meritorious personnel not in Beijing, will be forwarded on their behalf by the Technical Cooperation Bureau of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade.

Li Qiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, Chen Shuliang, Deputy Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and heads of relevant departments such as the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, and the Ministry of Building Materials Industry attended the medal presentation ceremony.

    庆祝朝鲜人民军建军十周年
    朝鲜议会授予我国参加朝鲜建设有功人员以勋章奖章
    新华社8日讯　朝鲜驻我国大使李永镐和夫人今晚在北京举行盛大招待会，庆祝朝鲜人民军建军十周年。
    国防部长彭德怀元帅和中国人民解放军总参谋长粟裕大将等出席了招待会。
    李永镐大使在招待会上讲话说，十年来，朝鲜人民军在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的正确领导下，坚决捍卫了我国人民的革命果实。尤其是在三年祖国解放战争当中，朝鲜人民军、朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军并肩作战，高度发挥了爱国主义和集体英雄主义精神，打垮了美帝国主义侵略军队和李承晚匪帮的武装进攻，保卫了祖国的自由、独立和人民的幸福，对亚洲和世界和平的伟大事业作出了贡献。
    李永镐大使说，继续霸占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮仍在千方百计地阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，粗暴地违反停战协定，并且正在把南朝鲜变为侵略性的原子基地。他说，从我国的目前形势出发，今年2月5日朝鲜政府代表全体朝鲜人民的意志，再一次发表了声明，阐明了关于一切外国军队同时撤出南北朝鲜和在全朝鲜实行自由选举等和平统一祖国的合理主张。全体朝鲜人民正一致奋起为其实现而斗争。
    彭德怀元帅在会上讲了话。他说，朝鲜人民军在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，英勇地完成了自己所担负的光荣任务。朝鲜停战后，朝鲜人民军坚强地捍卫着朝鲜的和平劳动和社会主义建设。同时在加强军队建设的事业中也获得了光辉的成就。中国人民解放军对兄弟般的朝鲜人民军所取得的每一个成就和胜利都感到衷心的欢欣。
    彭德怀元帅说，两天前，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府就朝鲜的和平统一问题发表了重要声明，中国政府也发表了声明，完全赞同并且支持朝鲜政府这一重大的和平倡议。中国人民和中国人民解放军完全拥护上述声明。但是，最近美帝国主义仍在继续制造远东的紧张局势，公然破坏停战协定、把原子武器运进南朝鲜，并在非军事区附近举行挑衅的原子突击演习。这是对远东及世界和平的严重威胁，应当引起我们高度警惕。中国人民将继续同朝鲜人民和全世界人民一起，为实现朝鲜的和平统一、为巩固亚洲及世界和平而坚决斗争到底。
    出席招待会的还有李达上将、张宗逊上将、萧华上将、甘泗淇上将、洪学智上将、杨成武上将、邓华上将、刘亚楼空军上将、陈士榘上将、李志民上将、宋时轮上将等中国人民解放军高级将领和驻京陆、海、空军军官。出席招待会的还有外交部副部长章汉夫。
    各国驻华使节和武官，也应邀出席了招待会。
    新华社8日讯　朝鲜驻我国大使馆今天下午三时在北京举行授勋仪式。李永镐大使受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长的委托，授予曾经参加朝鲜战后人民经济恢复建设工作并建立功勋、现已回国的我国技术人员和科学人员共三十九人以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国勋章和奖章。
    授勋仪式上，朝鲜驻我国大使馆参赞文在洙宣读了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会为授予参加朝鲜恢复建设工作的我国技术人员和科学人员以共和国勋章和奖章的政令。李永镐大使在热烈的掌声中把三级国旗勋章亲手佩带在受勋人路昭、王芸轩、陈力为三人的胸前。其余不在北京的三十六位有功人员的二十七枚三级国旗勋章和九枚功劳章以及勋章证书和奖章证书，由我国对外贸易部技术合作局负责代转。
