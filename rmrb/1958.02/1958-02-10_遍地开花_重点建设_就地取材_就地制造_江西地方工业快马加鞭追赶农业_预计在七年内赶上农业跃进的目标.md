　　Blooming Everywhere, Focusing on Key Construction, Utilizing Local Materials, Local Manufacturing:
    Jiangxi's Local Industry Rapidly Accelerating to Catch Up with Agriculture
    Expected to Achieve the Goal of Surpassing Agriculture in Seven Years
    (Our dispatch) The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently proposed the goal of Jiangxi's local industrial output value catching up with agriculture in seven years.
    In 1957, Jiangxi's total agricultural output value (excluding sideline occupations) was 1.55 billion yuan, and the total local industrial output value (including specialized handicrafts) was 610 million yuan, accounting for only 39% of the total agricultural output value. It is estimated that by 1964, the total agricultural output value of the province (excluding sideline occupations) will reach 3.992 billion yuan, and the preliminary planned local industrial output value will reach 4.05 billion yuan. In this way, Jiangxi's local industrial output value will develop at an average annual growth rate of 31%. This preliminary plan was discussed and approved by the Provincial Party Committee's District Party Committee, Prefectural, and Municipal Party Committee Secretaries Conference. The preliminary plan put forward specific requirements for the growth of light and heavy industries directly under the province, and the output value of local industries in special zones and cities.
    It is entirely possible for Jiangxi's local industrial output value to catch up with agriculture in seven years. First, the great leap forward in agriculture throughout the province will open up broad prospects for the great leap forward in industry. According to the agricultural production plan, by 1964, agriculture can provide cotton needed for 500,000 spindles, jute needed for 500 sack-making machines, ramie needed for 70,000 spindles, sugarcane needed for daily crushing of 7,000 tons, raw materials needed for daily production of 800 tons of paper, and sufficient raw materials needed for winemaking, oil extraction, cigarette rolling, canned food and other food industries. At the same time, the great leap forward in agriculture requires industry to supply a large amount of means of production. According to preliminary estimates, by 1964, 700,000 tons of various chemical fertilizers will be needed, and over the seven years a cumulative total of 5,000 standard units of tractors, 300,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage equipment, and a large number of various agricultural machinery and transportation tools will be needed. By 1964, the total value of means of production needed by agriculture from industry will be approximately 400 to 600 million yuan. With the increase in farmers' purchasing power (estimated to increase 1.5 times in seven years), the demand for various consumer goods in rural areas will greatly increase, with a total value of approximately 1.2 billion yuan. Second, the province is rich in underground resources. According to preliminary data, iron ore reserves can reach more than 700 million tons, and more than 40 types of non-ferrous metals and rare metals have been identified, and coal reserves are more than 1.8 billion tons. Third, thanks to the successful completion of the first five-year construction plan, local industrial construction has a certain foundation. At the same time, it can also receive support from state-owned industries. Fourth, Jiangxi Province has a suitable geographical location and extremely convenient water and land transportation, which facilitates obtaining technical assistance and cooperation from other provinces; the province's internal transportation is also very developed, which is conducive to the development of local industries. Fifth, through the rectification campaign and the socialist education movement, the class consciousness of the province's workers has been greatly improved, and their enthusiasm for production and construction has been unprecedentedly high. In particular, the recent criticism of right-leaning conservative ideas has further boosted the revolutionary drive of the workers.
    In order to successfully achieve this great leap forward plan, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee proposed that party and government leading organs at all levels must immediately and effectively strengthen their leadership over local industries. The industrial departments of party committees and governments above the county level should be enriched and strengthened, and one of the party committee secretaries must be fixed to be in charge of or concurrently manage industrial work. At present, a survey and research should be carried out quickly, and specific plans should be formulated based on the indicators and tasks assigned by the Provincial Party Committee to various places. Secondly, we must implement the policy of "local industries serving agricultural production and closely integrating with the rural economy" and the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." Party and government at all levels must proceed from this policy to consider and formulate plans for the development of local industries, and revise the original 1958 plan, because according to the original plan, the total output value of local industries in the province in 1958 will only increase by 15% compared with 1957. This speed is far from the requirement of an average annual increase of 31% to catch up with agriculture in seven years, and cannot adapt to the new situation and tasks.
    The Provincial Party Committee believes that to make local industries develop more and faster, it is necessary to adopt a combination of blooming everywhere and focusing on key construction. Larger industrial enterprises with large scale, large investment, and complex technology should be established by the province; special zones and cities should establish more medium-sized and small enterprises; and counties and below should mainly establish small enterprises. In addition, it is necessary to mobilize agricultural cooperatives to establish some small-scale industries with low investment, quick results, and simple technology in accordance with the principles of using local materials, local manufacturing, and local sales.
    If this plan is fully realized in seven years, Jiangxi's local industry will take a big step forward. By then, the province will produce 9 million tons of raw coal, 300,000 tons of steel, 500,000 tons of cement, 600,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, 50,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage equipment, 400,000 bales of cotton yarn, 200,000 tons of machine-made paper, 80,000 tons of sugar, 100,000 boxes of cigarettes, 10 million pairs of rubber shoes, 150,000 tons of edible oil, 70,000 tons of wine, and many other industrial products each year.

　　遍地开花　重点建设　就地取材　就地制造
    江西地方工业快马加鞭追赶农业
    预计在七年内赶上农业跃进的目标
    本报讯　中共江西省委最近提出了全省地方工业总产值七年赶上农业的跃进目标。
    江西省1957年农业总产值（不包括副业）为十五点五亿元，地方工业总产值（包括专业手工业）为六点一亿元，仅占农业总产值的39％。预计到1964年，全省农业总产值（不包括副业）将达到三九点九二亿元，初步规划的地方工业总产值那时将达到四十点五亿元。这样，江西省地方工业总产值就将以每年平均增长31％的速度向前发展。这个初步规划是经省委召开的区党委、地、市委书记会议讨论通过的。初步规划中对省直属轻重工业和专区、市地方工业产值的增长，都提出了具体要求。
    江西省地方工业总产值七年赶上农业是完全可能的。第一，全省农业大跃进将为工业的大跃进开辟广阔的前途。按照农业生产规划，到1964年农业就可以提供五十万纱锭所需的棉花、五百台麻袋机所需的黄麻、七万纺锭所需的苎麻、日榨七千吨榨量所需的甘蔗、日产八百吨纸所需的原料，还有充分的酿酒、榨油、卷烟、罐头等食品工业所需要的原料。同时农业大跃进需要工业供应大量的生产资料。据初步估算，到1964年需要各种化学肥料七十万吨，七年累计需要拖拉机五千个标准台、排灌设备三十万匹马力，以及大量的各种农业机械和运输工具。到1964年农业需要由工业供应的生产资料总值约为四至六亿元。随着农民购买力的提高（七年估计提高一点五倍），农村对各种生活资料的需要量将大大增加，总值约为十二亿元。第二，省内地下资源丰富。据已有的初步资料，铁矿石可达七亿吨以上，有色金属和稀有金属已查明的品种达四十多种，煤的储量在十八亿吨以上。第三，由于第一个五年建设计划胜利的完成，地方工业建设有了一定的基础。同时还可以得到国营工业支援。第四，江西省地理位置适中，水陆交通极为方便，便于取得外省的技术援助与配合协作；省内交通也很发达，有利于地方工业的发展。第五，全省职工通过整风和社会主义教育运动，阶级觉悟大大提高，生产建设的热情空前高涨。特别是最近开展的反右倾保守思想的批判，职工们更加鼓起了革命干劲。
    为了胜利实现这个大跃进的计划，江西省委提出：各级党政领导机关必须立即切实加强对地方工业的领导。县以上党委和政府的工业部门，应该充实和加强，党委书记中必须固定一人专管或兼管工业工作。目前应当迅速地进行一次调查研究，根据省委给各地规定的指标任务，制订出具体的规划。其次，必须贯彻执行“地方工业为农业生产服务，并与农村经济密切相结合”和“多、快、好、省”的方针。各级党政必须从这个方针出发，来考虑和制定发展地方工业的规划，并且修改原订的1958年计划，因为按照原订计划，1958年全省地方工业总产值比1957年仅增长15％。这个速度比七年赶上农业的平均每年应增长31％的要求相差太远，不能适应新的形势和任务。
    省委认为，要使地方工业发展多一些和快一些，必须采取遍地开花和重点建设相结合的办法。规模大、投资多、技术复杂的较大型的工业企业，由省兴办；专区、市多办一些中、小型企业；县以下主要办小型企业。此外，要发动农业社依照就地取材、就地制造、就地销售的原则，办一些投资少、收效快、技术简单的小型工业。
    七年后，这个规划如果全面实现，江西省的地方工业将大大向前跨进一步。到那时，全省每年将生产九百万吨原煤、三十万吨钢材、五十万吨水泥、六十万吨化肥、五万匹马力的排灌设备、四十万件棉纱、二十万吨机制纸、八万吨糖，十万箱卷烟、一千万双胶鞋、十五万吨食油、七万吨酒和其他许多工业产品。
