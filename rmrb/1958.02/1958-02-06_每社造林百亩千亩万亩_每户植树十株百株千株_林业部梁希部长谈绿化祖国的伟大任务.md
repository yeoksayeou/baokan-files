I would like to introduce the situation of forestry construction during the First Five-Year Plan and some opinions on future work.

I. Achievements in Forestry Construction

Forestry, like other sectors of the national economy, has completed the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeded its targets under the leadership of the Party.

Afforestation: Over the five years, the country afforested 10.32 million hectares (the 1957 figure is the planned figure, same below), which is equal to 33 times the total afforestation area in old China from 1911 to 1946 (35 years) (one hectare equals 15 mu). Among them:

	(1) More than 4.74 million hectares of timber forests were planted, mainly distributed in Hunan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other ten provinces. It is estimated that after these young forests grow into timber in 30 years, they can increase the amount of timber by more than 700 to 800 million cubic meters.

	(2) More than 1.36 million hectares of shelter forests were planted, mainly in western Northeast, eastern Inner Mongolia, eastern Henan, northern Shaanxi, the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, and coastal areas of Shandong, Hebei, and Guangdong where wind and sand are severe. The shelter forests in the Turpan Basin and the edges of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, and Hainan Island in Guangdong have also been surveyed and partially constructed. In addition, during the high tide of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production, vast rural areas across the country have widely built small-scale farmland shelter forests at the township and commune levels. Areas where shelter forests were built earlier have already shown the effect of forests on transforming nature and stabilizing agricultural production. For example, 16 counties in eastern Henan built more than 46,000 hectares of shelter forests, protecting 170,000 hectares of farmland, and also reclaimed more than 40,000 hectares of previously unusable sandy wasteland, establishing five state-owned farms and one horticultural farm. In 1956, planting 8,000 hectares yielded 6.23 million jin of wheat, more than 210,000 jin of cotton, 4 million jin of peanuts, and 290,000 jin of apples and grapes, bringing infinite vitality to the once desolate old course of the Yellow River.

	(3) More than 1.27 million hectares of soil and water conservation forests were planted, mainly in the upper and middle reaches of rivers in areas with severe water and drought disasters. In addition, 670,000 hectares of mountains were closed for afforestation. According to statistics from the State Council's Soil and Water Conservation Committee, the area of soil erosion controlled nationwide is now approximately 190,000 square kilometers, accounting for 13.6% of the total soil erosion area of 1.5 million square kilometers nationwide. Of course, soil and water conservation work does not rely solely on afforestation; it must be combined with agricultural, pastoral, and water conservancy measures. However, according to the governance experience of typical areas such as Yanggao County in Shanxi Province, Jiyuan County in Henan Province, and Wushan County in Gansu Province, afforestation and cultivating forests, and greening barren mountains are regarded as a fundamental measure for conserving water sources and maintaining soil and water. For example, Jiyuan County in Henan Province planted trees and cultivated forests on 230,000 mu to control the Mang River, and combined it with the construction of terraced fields and water cellars on hillsides to intercept rainwater. It has now achieved results: rainfall of 10 mm does not cause surface runoff, and rainfall of 30 mm does not cause water to flow downhill.

	(4) More than 1.91 million hectares of special economic forests were planted, including 900,000 hectares of new oil tea forests (from 1950 to 1957) and 930,000 hectares of tung oil forests. These special economic forests not only have a larger area than before, but also have greatly improved management methods, resulting in a gradual increase in production. In 1949, the national tung oil production was only 96,000 tons, but in 1957 it had risen to 140,000 tons, approaching the highest annual output of 153,000 tons before liberation. The yield per unit area of tea oil has also doubled compared to the early days of liberation.

Forest Fire Prevention: In order to effectively control mountain fires and prevent forest fires, during the First Five-Year Plan, the country built 10,379 kilometers of forest roads (the 1957 figure is the planned figure, same below), erected 13,738 kilometers of forest area telephone lines, opened 19,062 kilometers of firebreaks, and established 2,153 observation towers. Some new forest fire prevention technologies were promoted in key large-area state-owned forest areas in Northeast and Inner Mongolia, and 55 forest fire forecast stations and 8 chemical fire extinguishing stations were established. In addition to the implementation of aerial forest protection in the forest areas of Northeast and Inner Mongolia, pilot projects were also conducted in the Southwest in 1957. However, the main force for forest fire prevention is still the masses. In recent years, under the education of the Party, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses in forest areas has been continuously improved. They have regarded forest fire prevention as a glorious patriotic action. Especially after the promulgation of the draft National Agricultural Development Program in 1956, a "no forest fire movement" was launched in most forest areas across the country. In the first half of 1957, 155 forest fire-free counties and 12,215 forest fire-free townships emerged in 11 provinces, including Heilongjiang, Jilin, Shaanxi, Fujian, Guizhou, and Sichuan. This greatly reduced forest fires nationwide.

Forest Management: In terms of forest management, since 1953, the state has successively established forest management agencies in large-area state-owned forest areas. Up to now, there are 975 forest management stations and 62 forest management districts nationwide. The establishment of these institutions has played a certain role in protecting and rationally managing existing forests, and in promoting forest tending and regeneration.

Although forestry construction has achieved some successes in the past five years, there are still many shortcomings, the most important of which are: low afforestation survival rate, forest regeneration lagging behind logging, serious fire losses, and a lot of waste in timber harvesting and utilization, etc., which must be quickly corrected in the future.

II. Facing Glorious Tasks

At present, the country's economic construction is advancing by leaps and bounds. Therefore, the tasks before us are becoming increasingly arduous.

First, the timber supply problem: Last year, the national timber supply was already tight. In the future, with the rapid development of socialist construction in our country and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the state's demand for timber will continue to increase. Preliminary estimates show that by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the state will need 47 million cubic meters of timber; by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan, it will need 75 million cubic meters of timber; and by the end of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the demand will be over 100 million cubic meters. This only includes the timber needed by the state, cities, and some civilian use. If all civilian use timber and firewood are included, it would be even more. It is estimated that the timber needed in the next 30 years can still be supplied from existing forests if used sparingly, while the timber needed after 30 years must rely on the forests planted now. Therefore, the task before us is significant.

Second, the soil and water conservation problem: Everyone knows that afforestation has a significant effect on preventing wind and sand and conserving soil and water. In the past five years, we have planted more than 2.86 million hectares of wind and sand prevention forests and soil and water conservation forests. However, the harm of wind and sand erosion and soil erosion to agricultural production is still very serious in the vast territory of our country. Especially soil erosion, almost all larger river basins have this phenomenon. For example, the average annual sediment load in Shanxian County, Yellow River, is as high as 1.38 billion tons. Such a large amount of soil loss causes the upstream to lose soil and fertilizer, which inevitably leads to reduced crop yields. The silting of downstream riverbeds inevitably causes floods. Moreover, without good soil and water conservation, reservoirs will soon be filled with sediment. The lifespan of reservoirs such as the Guanting Reservoir, the Foziling Reservoir, the Meishan Reservoir, and the Sanmenxia Dam, which started construction last year, depends on the speed of afforestation and soil and water conservation work upstream. Therefore, the State Council's Soil and Water Conservation Committee requires us to afforest 800 million mu nationwide in the next ten years, which is a major and glorious task.

Third, the supply of forestry specialty products and by-products: Forests have countless forestry specialty products and by-products, such as tung oil, tea oil, lacquer, rosin, camphor, gallnuts, white wax, walnuts, chestnuts, Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, mushrooms, wood ears, bamboo shoots, and various precious furs, which are important industrial raw materials and consumer goods. Most Chinese medicinal materials also come from the mountains, mainly 358 kinds, of which wild ones account for 80%, with a total annual output value of more than 200 million yuan. According to statistics in 1955, the total value of mountain forest by-products and specialty products alone accounted for more than 50% of the national export commodities. It is evident that the economic potential of mountainous areas is huge. The Party Central Committee has put forward the great policy of facing the mountainous areas, calling on cadres to go up the mountains. Mountainous areas are the main bases for forestry production. Developing forestry in mountainous areas can not only meet the growing needs of domestic and foreign markets for timber, forestry specialty products, and by-products, but also ensure the development of agriculture and animal husbandry and improve the lives of farmers in mountainous areas. This is another major task for us.

III. Current Active Measures

In order to achieve the above tasks, the following measures must be actively taken: 1. Vigorously carry out the afforestation movement: Article 18 of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) has already put forward the task of greening the motherland to the people of the whole country.

	Greening the motherland is a cause for all people. Therefore, afforestation mainly relies on the masses and cooperatives. We hope that agricultural cooperatives with land and labor in mountainous and hilly areas will strive to create "hundred-mu forests," "thousand-mu forests," "five-thousand-mu forests," and "ten-thousand-mu forests" for each commune; and plant trees around houses, villages, roads, and waterways in the plains, striving for each household to plant ten, hundreds, or thousands of trees.

	In order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation, it is necessary to combine long-term interests with current interests. This requires: (1) Except for areas where the masses originally operated timber forests with a foundation and habit, they should mainly develop timber forests, and appropriately develop special economic forests such as tung oil and tea oil and fuelwood forests that yield quicker results. (2) Intercropping between agriculture and forestry. For example, intercropping crops for several years after planting Chinese fir in the south, and planting legumes in fish-scale pits in the north can provide grain harvest. (3) Afforestation should be as dense as possible so that there can be income from firewood and timber during tending.

	Greening must also actively develop state-owned afforestation (afforestation with state investment). State-owned afforestation has greater advantages than cooperative afforestation; it has more skilled workers; the afforestation survival rate is higher; it can strictly follow the national plan, mainly developing timber forests; it can be planted and tended completely according to technical requirements; and the state can directly harvest after the forest grows.

	If state-owned afforestation can develop 15 million hectares in the next ten years, and each hectare averages 200 cubic meters of timber after 30 years, it can produce 100 million cubic meters of timber for the country every year. If the masses can complete 30 million hectares of afforestation in ten years, and each hectare averages 100 cubic meters of timber after 30 years, it can also produce 100 million cubic meters of timber every year. Adding the planting of trees around houses and existing forest production during the Second Five-Year Plan, it is estimated that more than 300 million cubic meters of timber can be supplied annually after 30 years.

	Of course, this estimate is based on very good quality afforestation. Therefore, from seed collection, seedling cultivation, land preparation, afforestation, tending to protection, we must strictly follow scientific methods to ensure that one plant is planted and survives, and one forest is planted and survives. In short, it is necessary to implement the instructions of the CPC Central Committee: "Not only to plant quickly, but also to plant well; not only to plant more, but also to plant alive; not only to plant trees, but also to cultivate seedlings; not only to afforest, but also to protect the forests."

2. Developing fast-growing tree species: This is an important measure to solve the problem of insufficient timber supply. There are many fast-growing native tree species in the plains of our country, such as poplar, elm, and ailanthus in the north, and eucalyptus and paulownia in the south. They can be felled and utilized ten years after planting. In the future, fast-growing trees with higher economic value should be planted in large quantities around houses, cemeteries, and river beaches. Strive to plant 10 billion fast-growing trees during the Second Five-Year Plan. After 15 years, 100 million cubic meters of timber can be produced every year, providing the country with fiber timber and mine pillars, etc., and solving the problem of firewood for the masses and some civilian timber.

3. Strengthen "regeneration of logging areas" (planting new forests on logged forest land). Regeneration mainly adopts artificial regeneration and artificially promoted natural regeneration. And the cost of forest regeneration in state-owned forest areas should be regarded as the raw material cost of timber production and included in the timber production cost, so that it is possible to accelerate the speed of forest regeneration in the near future and achieve "plant two for every one logged... plant five, plant ten." Not only to regenerate with logging, but also to strive to restore old logging areas, burned areas, and forest gaps to forests.

4. Actively improve the utilization rate of timber and oppose waste of timber: The spirit of the Democratic Republic of Germany and Czechoslovakia in making full use of forest resources and saving timber is worth learning. They have small processing plants near forest areas, using almost all of the bark, branches, twigs, waste materials, and crushed materials after logging. Cement is used to make piles at the bottom of electric poles to extend the service life. Railway sidings are made of waste materials and small materials into half-cut sleepers. In the past, we rarely utilized bark, branches, twigs, small materials, standing dead trees, and decayed wood during logging. This should be reversed in the future: appropriately increase necessary transportation equipment to strive to transport all timber with utilization value out of the logging area; promote simple processing and timber production near the forest area, develop various fiberboards, artificial boards, wood hydrolysis, and wood dry distillation industries to fully utilize waste materials and improve the utilization rate of timber; in the use of timber, require all material-needed departments to actively research alternative tree species, expand the scope of tree species and wood types, rationally reduce timber usage standards, and make extensive use of cement, bamboo, and other substitutes without affecting product and engineering quality, in order to reduce the contradiction of insufficient timber supply.

5. Gradually transition from centralized large-area clear-cutting to decentralized small-scale logging: In order to ensure the supply of timber for national construction and make full use of existing mature and over-mature forests, it is necessary to fully expand logging operations and reach remote forest areas. In order to rationally utilize forest resources, in the future, the operating area of logging enterprises should be appropriately reduced from the perspective of both biological and economic requirements, and gradually transition from centralized large-area clear-cutting to decentralized small-scale logging. This will not only increase the production of more timber for the country, but also greatly increase the management intensity of existing forests and increase forest growth. This is a good way to improve forest management and rationally utilize resources. We are actively creating conditions to achieve this.

IV. Three Conditions to Guarantee

To complete the above three major tasks, in addition to the above measures, three conditions are also needed:

1. Local Party and government need to further strengthen leadership over forestry work and put forestry work on the agenda. Carry out mass afforestation movements and ensure the quality of afforestation and improve the survival rate of afforestation. Recently, Pinggu County and Xingtai County in Hebei Province were able to launch a vigorous comprehensive greening movement because the county Party secretary and county head personally took action and took the lead in planting trees on the mountains. There is a saying circulating in the mountainous area of Xingtai: "In the old society, the county head went up the mountain in a sedan chair, but in the new society, the county head goes up the mountain to plant trees." This shows how much encouragement it is to the masses when Party and government leaders attach importance to forestry and leaders personally take action!

2. The Youth League needs to mobilize the youth of the whole country to take the lead and launch a large-scale greening upsurge. According to experience, the greening movement of agencies, schools, groups, and enterprises is most active among the youth. Especially in rural areas, most of the "hundred-mu forests," "thousand-mu forests," and "ten-thousand-mu forests" of many cooperatives are led by the Youth League. Comrade Wang Zhiying, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the Lighthouse United Commune in Xingtai County, Hebei, led the youth and the masses to create a "Ten-Thousand-Mu Communist Youth League Forest" in one year, which is a significant example.

3. Need to open up forest area transportation. The Democratic Republic of Germany has 110,000 kilometers of forest roads in 1.9 million hectares of forest area, and almost all forest areas are accessible by cars; Czechoslovakia has more than 49,000 kilometers of forest roads in 4.2 million hectares of forest area. However, in our 76.6 million hectares of forests, only more than 10,000 kilometers of forest roads were built during the First Five-Year Plan. With such forest area transportation, how can we obtain the convenience of forest protection and management? How can we fully expand logging in state-owned forests and gradually achieve decentralized small-area logging from centralized large-area clear-cutting? How can we develop the mountain economy and improve the lives of farmers? How can we improve the utilization rate of timber and use waste materials as much as possible?

We believe that to do a good job in forestry, we must first do a good job in transportation. In the south, Zhejiang's method is very good. In 1956, they invested 620,000 yuan to open up more than 100 kilometers of forest roads and waterways, which increased the production of 560,000 cubic meters of timber, bringing 10 million yuan worth of benefits to the country and local people. In large-area state-owned forest areas, the state should invest more in road and river construction. However, due to the weak strength of the forestry department, it cannot open up forest area transportation alone. We hope that the transportation and railway departments will strongly support and build the highways and railways to the forest areas as soon as possible.

All in all, in order to support industry, to ensure catching up with and surpassing Britain in the next fifteen years, and to implement the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, the forestry department must, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, arouse revolutionary enthusiasm, and strive to quickly complete the glorious task of greening the motherland!

　　每社造林百亩千亩万亩  每户植树十株百株千株
    林业部梁希部长谈绿化祖国的伟大任务
    我想介绍一下第一个五年计划期间的林业建设情况和关于今后工作的意见。
    一、林业建设的成绩
    林业，也和其他国民经济各部门一样，在党的领导下，第一个五年计划提前和超额完成了。
    造林：五年间，全国造林一千零三十二万公顷（一九五七年是计划数字，下同），等于旧中国从一九一一年到一九四六年三十五年间造林总面积的三十三倍（一公顷等于十五市亩）。其中：
    （1）营造用材林四百七十四万多公顷，主要分布在湖南、贵州、四川、云南、江西、福建、广东、广西、安徽、浙江等十省，估计三十年后这些幼林长大成材，即可增加七到八亿多立方公尺的木材。
    （2）营造防护林约一百三十六万多公顷，主要是在东北西部，内蒙东部，河南东部，陕西北部，甘肃河西走廊以及山东、河北及广东沿海等风沙严重地区，而新疆吐鲁番盆地、塔里木盆地边缘天山北麓和广东海南岛等地的防护林，也已进行了勘测，并开始部分营造。此外，在全国农业合作化高潮和农业生产高潮中，全国广大农村，还以乡、社为单位，广泛地营造了小规模的农田防护林。防护林造得较早的地区，已经显示出森林对改造自然、稳定农业生产的效果。如豫东十六个县造了四万六千多公顷的防护林，保护了十七万公顷的农田，并且还开辟了四万多公顷原来不能利用的沙荒，建立起五个国营农场和一个园艺场，一九五六年播种八千多公顷，就收获小麦六百二十三万斤，棉花二十一万多斤，花生四百万斤，苹果，葡萄二十九万斤，给往日荒凉的黄河故道，带来了无限的青春。
    （3）营造水土保持林一百二十七万多公顷，主要是在水旱灾害严重地区的河流中上游。另外，还封山育林六十七万公顷。据国务院水土保持委员会的统计，现在全国已控制水土流失面积约十九万多平方公里，占全国水土流失总面积一百五十万平方公里的百分之十三点六。当然，水土保持工作不单靠造林，必须结合农、牧和水利措施，但据山西省阳高县、河南省济源县、甘肃省武山县等典型地区的治理经验，都把造林、育林、绿化荒山当作涵养水源、保持水土的一个根本措施。如河南省济源县治理漭河，植树造林、封山育林二十三万亩，结合在丘陵坡地大量修筑梯田、打水窖，以拦蓄雨水，现在已收到效果：降雨十公厘，地表不发生径流，降雨三十公厘，水不下坡。
    （4）营造特用经济林一百九十一万多公顷。其中新造油茶林九十万公顷（一九五○到一九五七年）和油桐林九十三万公顷。这些特用经济林，不仅林地面积比以前扩大，经营管理方法也比以前大有改善，从而产量逐年上升。一九四九年全国桐油产量仅九万六千吨，一九五七年已上升到十四万吨，接近解放前最高年产量十五万三千吨的水平。茶油的单位面积产量也比解放初期提高一倍左右。
    护林防火：为了有效地控制山火，预防森林火灾，在第一个五年计划期间，全国修建林道一万零三百七十九公里（一九五七年是计划数字，下同），架设林区电话线一万三千七百三十八公里，开辟防火线一万九千零六十二公里，设立了望台二千一百五十三座，并在东北、内蒙古大面积国有林区重点推行了一些新的护林防火技术措施，建立了森林火灾预报站五十五个，化学灭火站八个。航空护林，除在东北、内蒙古林区施行外，一九五七年又在西南进行了试点。但是，护林防火的主要力量还不在此，而在群众。近年来，林区广大群众，在党的教育下，社会主义觉悟不断提高，他们已把护林防火看作是一件光荣的爱国行动，特别是一九五六年农业发展纲要草案颁布后，全国绝大部分林区掀起了一个“无森林火灾运动”。一九五七年上半年，在黑龙江、吉林、陕西、福建、贵州、四川等十一个省，就出现了一百五十五个无森林火灾县，一万二千二百一十五个无森林火灾乡。从而使全国森林火灾大为减少。
    森林经营：在森林经营方面，从一九五三年开始，国家在大面积国有林区陆续建立了森林经营机构，到现在为止，全国已有森林经营所九百七十五个，林管区六十二个。这些机构的设置，对于保护和合理经营现有森林，对于促进森林的抚育更新，都起了一定的作用。
  五年来，林业建设虽然取得了一些成就，但还存在着不少缺点，最主要的是：造林成活率不高，森林更新跟不上采伐，火灾损失还很严重，木材采伐和利用上浪费很多，等等，今后都须迅速加以改正。
    二、面对着光荣任务
    目前，国家经济建设突飞猛进，一日千里，因此，摆在我们面前的任务亦日益艰巨。
    第一，木材供应问题：去年全国木材供应已呈紧张现象，今后随着我国社会主义建设飞速发展和人民生活水平不断提高，国家对木材的需要将日益增加。初步估计，第二个五年计划末年，国家需要木材，将达四千七百万立方公尺；第三个五年计划末年，需要木材七千五百万立方公尺；到了第四个五年计划末年，需要木材将在一亿立方公尺以上，这还只算了国家、城市和一部分民用材，如果把全部民用材和烧柴都算上，那就更多了。估计，今后三十年内所需要的木材，如果节约使用，还有可能从现有的森林来供应，而三十年后所需要的木材，则必须靠现在所造的森林。所以，摆在我们面前的任务是重大的。
    第二，水土保持问题：大家知道，造林对防风防沙、保持水土的效用是显著的。过去五年，我们营造了二百八十六万多公顷的防风防沙林和水土保持林，但是，在我国的广大国土上，风沙侵蚀和水土流失的危害农业生产的情况，还是十分严重的。特别是水土流失，在比较大的河流流域，几乎都有这种现象，例如黄河陕县年平均输沙量竟有十三亿八千万吨。这样大量的泥土流失，使上游损失土壤和肥料，怎能不造成农田减产？使下游河床淤塞，怎能不造成水灾？而且不搞好水土保持，水库也很快就会被泥沙淤平，如官厅水库，佛子岭水库，梅山水库和去年开工的三门峡大水库，这些水库寿命的长短，都决定于上游造林工作和水土保持工作进行的快慢。因此，国务院水土保持委员会要求我们，要在今后十年内全国造林八亿亩，这是一个重大的也是光荣的任务。
    第三，林业特产和副产品供应问题：森林中有数不清的林业特产和副产品，如桐油、茶油、漆、松香、樟脑、五倍子、白蜡、核桃、板栗、花椒、八角、香菇、木耳、竹笋和各种珍贵的皮毛等，都是重要的工业原料和消费资料。中国药材也多出在山上，主要有三百五十八种，其中野生的占百分之八十，总产值年约二亿余元。据一九五五年统计，全国出口物资，单是山区林副特产总值就占百分之五十以上。足见山区的经济潜力很大。党中央已经提出面向山区的伟大方针，号召干部上山。山区是林业生产的主要基地，在山区发展林业，不仅可以满足国内外市场对木材、林业特产和副产品日益增长的需要，而且，山上有了森林，才能有水有草，才能保证农业、畜牧业的发展，才能提高山区农民生活。这又是我们一个大任务。
    三、当前的积极措施
    为了实现上述任务，必须积极采取下列措施：一、大力开展造林运动：全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）第十八条，已经向全国人民提出了绿化祖国的任务。
    绿化祖国是全民事业，所以造林主要依靠群众，依靠合作社。我们希望：山区和丘陵地区有土地和劳力的农业社，争取每社营造“百亩林”、“千亩林”、“五千亩林”、“万亩林”；平原地区四旁植树（宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁）争取每户栽十株、百株、千株。
    为了发挥群众造林的积极性，必须注意把长远利益和目前利益结合起来，这就需要：（1）除群众原来经营用材林有基础有习惯的地区，应以发展用材林为主外，应适当发展收效较快的油桐、油茶等特用经济林和薪炭林。（2）农林间作。如南方杉木造林后混种农作物数年，北方鱼鳞坑中种豆类，可以有粮食收成。（3）造林尽可能密植，使抚育时可以有柴料和木料收入。
    绿化，还必须积极发展国营造林（国家投资造林）。国营造林比合作社造林具有更大的优越性；有较熟练的工人；造林成活率高；可以严格按国家计划办事，以发展用材林为主；可以完全按技术要求来进行栽植和抚育；成林后，国家可以直接采伐。
    如果在今后十年内发展国营造林一千五百万公顷，三十年后，每公顷平均出材二百立方公尺，每年就可以为国家生产用材一亿立方公尺。十年内，如果群众造林能完成三千万公顷，三十年后，每公顷平均出材一百立方公尺，每年也可以生产木材一亿立方公尺。加上第二个五年计划期间四旁植树和现有森林的生产，估计三十年后，每年可以供应木材约三亿立方公尺以上。
    当然，这个估计，是从很好质量的造林出发的，所以我们今后从采种、育苗、整地、造林、抚育直到保护，必须严格按照科学施行，要做到栽一株活一株，造一片活一片。总之，要贯彻执行中共中央的指示：“不但要快造，而且要造好；不但要多栽，而且要栽活；不但要植树，而且要育苗；不但要造林，而且要护林”。
    二、发展速生树种：这是解决木材供应不足问题的一项重要措施。我国平原地区，速生的乡土树种不少，如北方的杨树、榆树、臭椿，南方的桉树、泡桐，栽植后十几年就可以砍伐利用。今后应在四旁、坟地和河滩大量栽植经济价值较高的速生树。争取在第二个五年计划期间种植速生树一百亿株，十五年后每年可以出一亿立方公尺木材，为国家提供纤维用材和矿柱等，且可解决群众烧柴和一部分民用材问题。
    三、加强“采伐迹地更新”（在采伐了的林地上造新的森林）工作。更新，主要采取人工更新和人工促进天然更新。并且应该把国有林区森林更新费用作为木材生产的原料费，纳入木材生产成本，以便有可能在最近期间内加快森林更新速度，做到“采一造二……造五、造十”。不但随采伐，随更新，而且争取把旧采伐迹地，火烧迹地和林间空地都恢复成林。
    四、积极提高木材利用率，反对浪费木材：民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克充分利用森林资源和节约使用木材的精神是值得我们学习的。他们在林区附近设有小型加工厂，把采伐后的树皮、树枝、树梢、废材、碎料，几乎全部加以利用。电线杆底部用洋灰做椿，延长使用年限。铁道侧线是利用废材、小材做成半截枕木。而我们过去在采伐中，树皮、树枝、树梢、小材小料、枯立木、腐朽木却很少加以利用。此后应扭转过来：适当地增加必要的运输设备，争取把伐区内一切有利用价值的木材都运出来；在林区附近，推行简易的加工制材，发展各种纤维板、人造板，木材水解和木材干馏工业，以求充分利用废材，提高木材利用率；在木材使用中，要求各需材部门，在不影响产品和工程质量的原则下，积极研究代用树种，扩大树种材种的使用范围，合理降低木材使用标准，大量利用洋灰、竹子等代用品，以减少木材供应不足的矛盾。
    五、从集中的大面积皆伐，逐步过渡到分散的小规模采伐：为了保证供应国家建设用材，为了充分利用现有的成熟林和过熟林，必须把采伐工作全面铺开，直达偏远林区。为了合理利用森林资源，今后应该从生物要求和经济要求兼顾的观点出发，逐步把采伐企业的经营面积适当划小，由集中的大面积皆伐，逐步过渡到分散的小规模采伐。这样，不但可以为国家增产更多的木材，而且会大大提高现有林的经营强度，提高森林生长量。这是改善森林经营、合理利用资源的一种好办法。我们正在积极创造条件，促其实现。
    四、三个条件来保证
    要完成上述三大任务，除了采取上述措施外，还需要三个条件：
    1．需要各地党政进一步加强对林业工作的领导，把林业工作摆在议事日程上来。开展群众性的造林运动，并保证造林质量，提高造林成活率。最近河北省平谷县和邢台县，就是由于县委书记、县长亲自动手，带头上山造林，所以能够掀起了轰轰烈烈的一个全面绿化运动。在邢台山区流传着这样一句话：“旧社会县长上山用轿抬，新社会县长上山把树栽”。这说明党政领导重视林业，领导亲自动手，对群众是多么大的鼓舞啊！
    2．需要青年团发动全国青年，由青年带头，掀起一个大规模的绿化高潮。根据经验，不论机关、学校、团体、企业的绿化运动，都以青年为最活跃，特别在农村，许多合作社的“百亩林”、“千亩林”、“万亩林”，绝大部分由青年团带头造起来的，河北邢台县灯塔联合社团总支书记王志英同志带领了青年和群众，在一年中造了一个“万亩共青林”，就是显著的例子。
    3．需要开辟林区交通。民主德国在一百九十万公顷的林区内，有林道十一万公里，林区几乎全部通汽车；捷克斯洛伐克在四百二十万公顷的林区内，有四万九千多公里林道。而我们在七千六百六十万公顷的森林中，第一个五年计划期间只修建了一万多公里的林道。林区交通如此，怎样能够取得护林营林的便利？怎样能够在国有林内全面铺开采伐，由集中的大面积皆伐逐渐做到分散的小面积伐木？怎样能够发展山区经济，提高农民生活？怎样能够提高木材利用率，尽量使用废材？
    我们以为，要搞好林业，必先搞好交通。在南方，浙江的办法甚好，他们在一九五六年投资六十二万元，开辟了一百多公里的林道和河道，就增产了五十六万立方公尺木材，给国家和当地群众带来了一千几百万元的好处。在大面积国有林区，国家更应该投资修路、修河。但由于林业部门力量薄弱，不能单独开辟林区交通，我们希望交通及铁道部门大力支持，把通到林区的公路和铁路尽快地修建起来。
    总而言之，为了支援工业，保证在今后十五年内赶上和超过英国，为了贯彻执行农业发展纲要修正草案，林业部门必须在党的领导下‘在全国人民的支持下，克服右倾保守思想，鼓起革命干劲，为迅速完成绿化祖国的光荣任务而奋斗！
