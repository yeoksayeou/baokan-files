　　Xia Hong, Typesetting Worker, Beijing No. 2 Printing Factory
　　The "Weekly Riddle" in each issue of the "Printing Workers' Weekly" is always the most attractive. On the day of publication, the Youth League Committee's blackboard bulletin, "Youth Garden," would be covered with answers. The first three people to guess correctly would, as usual, receive a beautifully printed picture from the factory.
    However, this issue's "Weekly Riddle" has become an unsolved mystery.
    The riddle is: Take a look at who he is, and guess what he was doing in the last few days of the First Five-Year Plan?
    The riddle consists of three photos of the same person with different expressions.
    The first one shows him with his hands in his pockets, lips pursed as if whistling, looking calm and leisurely. Next to it is a small note: December 12, 1957, 11:57 AM.
    The second shows him imitating the posture of a modern soldier marching. His hands are raised to shoulder level, looking like a new recruit practicing the "goose step." Next to it is also a small note: 13th, 11:58 AM.
    The third is a running pose. Perhaps the photographer's technique wasn't very good, or perhaps the subject was running too fast, making his facial expression unclear. Next to it is: 14th, 12:00 PM. At the bottom is the author's signature: Amateur Photographer.
    Everyone can tell at a glance that the person in the photos is Wang Hai, a young type-casting technician. But these three photos have no background, so what exactly is he doing?
    Is he taking a walk or exercising? No, the noted dates and times negate these ideas. Because that time is neither a public holiday nor after work; it is the most intense moment of the factory's boiling labor upsurge.
    People are indeed perplexed. For three days in a row, not a single answer has been posted on "Youth Garden." It seems they'll have to wait for the next issue of the Weekly for the answer.
    On the fourth day, a four-grade north wind howled, tearing the big-character posters on the bulletin board to shreds. Yellow sand flew up, hitting people's faces and pounding against the windows. However, "Youth Garden" was crowded with people.
    "The answer!" "The answer is finally out!" The crowd discussed, gathering in layers, growing larger and larger, all wanting to see the elusive answer. A yellow big-character poster was posted on "Youth Garden," titled "My Self-Criticism." Below it was written:
    I was wrong. I painfully reveal this "riddle"!
    Every day at noon, in order to eat a little earlier, I didn't hesitate to waste working time. These three photos are all of me waiting in the cafeteria before the end of work to buy food. I hate my mistake and hope comrades will supervise and help me!
    I don't know who the amateur photographer is; however, I sincerely thank him!
                          Wang Hai
    This big-character poster was personally posted by Wang Hai. He got up very early this morning—which is rare for him—came to the factory, and quickly but carefully posted this big-character poster that he had finished writing after lights out last night on the blackboard. Then, he opened the door of the workshop and began cleaning his "Thomson" type-casting machine.
    People have become accustomed to open criticism recently. So, they don't feel this novel method is "inappropriate." On the contrary, they are more interested in the amateur photographer's originality. Who is the photographer? That has become a new riddle.
    The amateur photographer is Old Wu, a patient on sick leave for lung disease.
    The lung disease patients eat at 11:30 AM every day. They almost always see Wang Hai come here before the end of work to wait for food. His method is very clever; he goes to the toilet five or six minutes early, and when he comes out of the toilet, it's only one or two minutes early. He comes into the cafeteria to chat with the cooks and the lung disease patients, or he does the actions in the photos to pass the "long" one or two minutes.
    One day, Old Wu asked him, "What time do you get off work?"
    "Twelve o'clock, of course!" he said complacently.
    "I see you come here early every day."
    "Nonsense," he looked at his watch and said slyly and triumphantly, "Listen! Hey—"
    "Ding—" As he spoke, the bell rang for the end of work. He made a face and darted towards the food counter.
    The lung disease patients discussed it and came up with this idea: they took these three photos for three days in a row.
    On the fourth day afternoon, Old Wu received a short note forwarded by the editorial board, which read:
    Respected Amateur Photographer Comrade:
    A self-criticism is not enough to satisfy us; we hope to see the real "answer" in the next issue.
　　　　　　　　　　　　A Reader
    The next day at noon, after the bell rang for the end of work, he and several lung disease patients came to the type-casting workshop. Next to the washbasin stood workers washing their hands; Wang Hai was carefully cleaning his fingernails with a nail brush. As they came in, the people washing their hands looked at them in unison, some smiling and greeting them. Old Wu quickly pressed the camera button, "Click!"
    "What is this for?" an old technician washing his hands asked them.
    "The answer!" People smiled knowingly at each other. Only Wang Hai's face flushed red. But, he was indeed smiling!

　　谜
　　北京印刷二厂排字工人　夏红
    每期“印工周报”上的“每周一谜”都是最吸引人的。出版的当天，团委会的黑板报“青年园地”上就会贴出一张一张的谜底。前三名猜中的人照例发给一张本厂精印的画片。
    可是，这期的“每周一谜”却成了不解之谜了。
    谜题是：你看看他是谁，再猜猜他在第一个五年计划的最后几天里在做什么？
    谜面是三张同一个人的不同表情的照片。
    第一张是双手插在裤兜里，嘴里像吹着口哨似的呶起双唇，样子泰然而悠闲。旁边注着小字：1957年12月12日十一点五十七分。
    第二张是他学着现代化军队走步的姿态。双手摆至平肩，俨然像个正在练习“正步走”的新战士。旁边也注着小字：13日十一点五十八分。
    第三张是速跑的姿势。可能是摄影师技术不高，或许是被摄者跑得太快了，以致面部的表情看不太真切。旁边注着的是：14日十二点正。最下面是作者的署名：业余摄影师。
    谁都一眼可以看出，照片上的人是铸字的青年技工王海。但这三张照片都没有背景，他究竟是在干吗呢？
    是在散步、在锻炼身体吗？不，那注着的日子和时间否定了这些看法。因为那时间既不是公休也不是工余，那是全厂沸腾着劳动热潮的最紧张的时刻。
    人们确是困惑了。一连三天，“青年园地”上也没贴出过一个谜底。看来，只好等下期周报作答了。
    第四天清晨，四级的北风呼啸着，把报壁上的大字报撕得稀烂。黄沙飞起，打在人的脸上、拍击着窗上的玻璃。可是，“青年园地”前却挤满了人群。
    “谜底！”“谜底到底出来了！”人群里议论着，一层层的聚拢，愈来愈多，都想看一看这难解的谜底。“青年园地”上贴着一张黄色的大字报，标题是“我的检讨”。下面写着：
    我错了。我痛苦地揭开这个“谜”吧！
    每天中午，为了早吃一会儿饭，却不惜浪费工作时间。这三张照片都是我每天没下班就提前到食堂等候买饭的情形。我痛恨自己的错误，希望同志们给我监督和帮助！
    谁是业余摄影师我也无从知道；不过，我诚恳的感谢他！
                          王海
    这张大字报是王海亲手贴的。这天早晨他很早起来，——这是他少有的事——来到厂里，迅速但认真的把这张昨晚熄灯后才写好的大字报贴在黑板上。然后，打开车间的门，就擦起他开的“汤姆逊”铸字机来了。
    近来人们已经习惯于公开的批评了。所以对这个新颖的方式也不感觉“欠妥”，反而倒对这位业余摄影师的别出心裁发生了兴趣。谁是摄影师哪？倒成了个新的谜了。
    业余摄影师是肺病休养员老吴。
    肺病休养员们每天是十一点半用饭。他们几乎每天看到王海在下班前就来这里等着买饭。他的办法还很巧妙，欠五、六分钟先去厕所，从厕所出来也就欠一、两分钟了。进食堂来或与炊事员、肺病休养员们聊天，或者做着照片上的动作，来消磨这“漫长”的一两分钟。
    有一天，老吴问他：“你几点下班？”
    “十二点呗！”他心安理得的说。
    “我看你每天都是提前来到这里的。”
    “胡说，”他看了看表，狡猾得意的说：“您听吧！嘿——”
    “嘡——”随着他的话音，下班的电铃清脆的响了起来。他做了个鬼脸，一个箭步蹿向卖菜的窗口。
    肺病休养员们一商量，便想出这么个办法，一连三天，照了这三张照片。
    第四天下午，老吴接到编委会转来的一封短笺，上面写着：
    尊敬的业余摄影师同志：
    一张检讨是不能令人满足的，我们希望的是在下期见到真正的“谜底”。
　　　　　　　　　　　　一读者
    次日中午，当下班铃响过之后，他和几个肺病休养员一起来到铸字车间。洗手池旁，站着洗手的工人们；王海正在用指甲刷细心的刷手指。他们一进来，洗手的人不约而同的向他们一望，有的笑着打招呼。老吴迅速的按动相机，“嚓”！
    “这是干什么？”一个洗手的老技工问他们。
    “谜底啊！”人们会意的相对大笑起来。只有王海脸上泛起两片红晕。可是，他确确实实的也在笑呵！
