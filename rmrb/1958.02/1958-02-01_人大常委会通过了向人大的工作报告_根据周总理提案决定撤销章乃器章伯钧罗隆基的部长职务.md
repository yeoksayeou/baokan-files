　　The meeting discussed the proposed agenda for the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress, the candidates for the Presidium and Secretary-General, and the candidates for the Chairman and members of the Motions Examination Committee as suggested by the Standing Committee. The meeting also discussed and approved the work report that the Standing Committee is preparing to deliver to the Congress. The Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress will officially open on February 1st.

　　The meeting heard the explanation of Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, discussed the motion proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai, and decided to remove the rightist Zhang Naiqi from the post of Minister of Food of the People's Republic of China, to remove the rightist Zhang Bojun from the post of Minister of Communications of the People's Republic of China, and to remove the rightist Luo Longji from the post of Minister of Forestry Industry of the People's Republic of China.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 31st — The State Council held its 69th plenary meeting on the afternoon of the 29th.

　　After hearing the explanation of Vice Premier and Director of the State Economic Commission Bo Yibo, the meeting discussed and approved the draft of the 1958 National Economic Plan. After hearing the explanation of Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian, the meeting discussed and approved the implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the draft of the 1958 National Budget. Both drafts will be submitted to the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress for deliberation and approval.

　　The meeting approved the regulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council regarding the principles for dealing with rightists among state-salaried personnel and university students.

　　After hearing the explanation of Premier Zhou Enlai, the meeting unanimously agreed that Zhang Naiqi, Minister of Food, Zhang Bojun, Minister of Communications, and Luo Longji, Minister of Forestry Industry, all members of the State Council, had exposed a series of rightist speeches and activities during the rectification campaign, betrayed the fundamental principles of the Constitution, and lost the trust of the people politically. These three rightists can no longer continue to serve as members of the highest state administrative organ—the position of minister. For this reason, the plenary meeting unanimously agreed to remove Zhang Naiqi from his current position as Minister of Food; to remove Zhang Bojun from his current position as Minister of Communications; to remove Luo Longji from his current position as Minister of Forestry Industry; and decided to submit these decisions to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation and decision.
