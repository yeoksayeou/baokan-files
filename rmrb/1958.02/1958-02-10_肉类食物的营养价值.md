　　The Nutritional Value of Meat Foods
　　Fan Wenxun
    Many people believe that meat foods are rich in nutrients, and a lack of meat will affect health.

    Here, I would like to first talk about the nutritional value of meat. According to the analysis of the Department of Nutrition of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, one catty of pork contains about two taels of protein, more than four taels of fat, and more than one qian of mineral salts. In addition, it also contains small amounts of vitamin B1, vitamin B2, and nicotinic acid. Beef has a higher protein content than pork, about three taels, and less fat, only more than one tael. Other ingredients are similar to pork. Lamb has a lower protein content than pork, only more than one tael. Other ingredients are about the same as pork. Among the nutrients contained in these meat foods, fat can be completely replaced by other types of oil (such as peanut oil, soybean oil, sesame oil). The content of mineral salts is far less than that in general fresh vegetables. As for vitamins, vegetables are better than meat, because vegetables contain not only the above-mentioned vitamins B1 and B2 and nicotinic acid, but also rich carotene (which can be converted into vitamin A in the human body) and vitamin C.

    In this way, the only thing worth considering is the nutritional value of meat protein. For a long time, people have believed that the nutritional value of animal food protein is better than that of plant food protein. This statement is generally correct. This is because protein itself is a very complex compound, which is composed of many different amino acids. The content of these many amino acids and the proportional relationship between them determine the quality of a certain protein's nutritional value. For example, eggs are known to be a very nutritious food, and one of the main reasons is that the amount and proportion of various amino acids contained in egg protein are the most suitable for human use, or the most conducive to the composition of human protein. Therefore, we say that for general infants and young children who are growing, it is necessary to give appropriate amounts of animal food to ensure their healthy development and growth. But this is not necessarily the case for adults. Many people have done research in this area. The Department of Nutrition of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences also used adults as experimental subjects and proved that when eating rice, supplementing with appropriate amounts of beans or bean products has the same effect as supplementing with meat, eggs, and milk. This is partly because adults grow more slowly and their needs are correspondingly reduced, and partly because there is a complementary effect between food proteins. That is to say, when a plant protein lacks a certain amino acid, it can often be supplemented by other plant proteins. This complementary effect is very beneficial for us to construct human protein. Among plant foods, beans or bean products (such as tofu, dried tofu, bean sprouts, tofu skin, etc.) are rich in protein, and the quality is also good, which can be used as a good supplementary food in our daily meals. In addition, various grains such as millet and corn can be eaten together to complement each other's shortcomings. In short, our meals should be more varied. If housewives can properly mix and match refined grains, coarse grains, beans (including bean products) and vegetables, not only can they fully guarantee our physiological needs and health, but also because the prices of these foods are relatively cheap, the purpose of diligence and thrift in managing the household is achieved.

### 肉类食物的营养价值

　　肉类食物的营养价值
　　范文洵
    很多人都认为肉类食物中含有丰富的养料，缺少肉食就会影响身体健康。
    这里，我想先谈一下肉类的营养价值。根据中国医学科学院营养学系的分析，一市斤猪肉中约含蛋白质二两多、脂肪四两多、矿物盐一钱多，另外还含有少量的一号乙种维生素、二号乙种维生素和尼克酸。牛肉的蛋白质含量则较猪肉为高，约有三两多，脂肪较少，只有一两多，其他成分和猪肉相似。羊肉的蛋白质含量则较猪肉为低，只有一两多，其他成分也和猪肉的含量差不多。这些肉类食物中所含的营养素，其中脂肪是完全可以用其他种类的油（如花生油、豆油、香油）代替的；矿物盐的含量则远不如一般新鲜蔬菜中含的多；至于维生素则更是蔬菜优于肉类了，因为蔬菜除了含有上述的一号和二号乙种维生素及尼克酸外，还含有丰富的葫萝卜素（在人体内能转变成为甲种维生素）和丙种维生素。
    这样，唯一值得我们考虑的便是肉类的蛋白质营养价值问题了。很久以来，人们都认为动物性食物的蛋白质营养价值要比植物性食物的蛋白质营养价值好。这种说法一般说来是对的。这是因为蛋白质本身是一个非常复杂的化合物，它是由许许多多不同的氨基酸组成的。这许多种氨基酸的含量以及它们之间的相互比例就决定了某一种蛋白质营养价值的好坏。譬如说鸡蛋，谁都知道是一种非常富于营养的食物，其主要原因之一也就是因为鸡蛋蛋白质中所含的各种氨基酸的量和比例是最适宜于人体利用，或最利于构成人体蛋白质的原故。因此我们说，对于一般正在生长的婴幼儿，为了保证他们的健康发育和成长，给予适量的动物性食品还是必需的。但是对于成年人来说就不尽如此了。在这方面已经有过不少人做过研究，中国医学科学院营养学系也曾用成年人作实验证明在吃大米饭时若辅助以适量的豆类或豆制品食物，是和辅助以肉类、鸡蛋和牛乳等的效果完全相同。这一方面是因为成年人的生长较为缓慢，需要量也相应减低，一方面则是由于食物蛋白质之间具有着一种互补作用，也就是说当一种植物性蛋白质缺乏某种氨基酸时，往往可以由他种植物性蛋白质来补充上，这种互补作用是非常有利于我们构成人体蛋白质的。在植物性食物中，豆类或豆制品食物（如豆腐、豆腐干、豆芽、油皮等）都含有丰富的蛋白质，而且质量也不错，可以作为我们日常饭菜中很好的补充食物。除此以外，各种杂粮如小米、玉米等配合食，都可互补长短。总之，我们的饭菜应该多些花样，如果主妇们能很好地把细粮、粗粮、豆类（包括豆制品）和蔬菜调配食用，不但完全可以保证我们生理上的需要和健康，而且由于这些食品的价格比较便宜，也达到了勤俭持家的目的。
