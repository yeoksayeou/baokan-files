　　I completely agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft 1958 National Budget," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the 1958 National Economic Plan," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on current language reform work and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, and I will resolutely implement them in future work.
　　Last October, I joined a delegation of 104 people organized by the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, consisting of leading party and government organs at all levels and people from all walks of life, to visit and express gratitude to all the staff and workers in the Qaidam Basin, and to inspect various undertakings in the basin. I would now like to report my observations to the congress.

　　Formerly Sparsely Populated, Today Machines Roar - Abundant Mineral Resources Will Contribute to National Construction
　　The Qaidam Basin covers an area of 220,000 square kilometers. In the past, more than 80% of the area was sparsely populated with difficult transportation. Except for the southeastern edge of the basin, which was inhabited by less than 5,000 households of nomadic Mongolian and Kazakh people, it was a virgin land without any social foundation. However, since the second half of 1954, after more than three years of active construction, not only have more than 350 state organs been established, and the population increased to more than 49,400 people, but a new industrial city with towering chimneys and roaring machines has also been built.
　　Under the attention and care of the Communist Party of China and the state, as well as the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee and government, the state has invested more than 478.8 million yuan in the basin from August 1954 to the present, and has sent many technical cadres. After exploration, it has been confirmed that the Qaidam Basin has many types of minerals and abundant reserves, as well as a large amount of fertile land and lush grassland, providing broad prospects for the development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. From the perspective of resource exploration and industrial construction: more than 20 kinds of mineral deposits have been discovered, including oil, iron, copper, lead, zinc, manganese, chromium, silver, sulfur, coal, lignite, salt, alkali, mirabilite, rock crystal, barite, asbestos, gypsum, and natural mercury. The most important of these are oil, salt, lead, and zinc.
　　Taking only oil as an example, after a few short years of geological surveying and light drilling, 103 oil-bearing structures with good closures have been discovered under the Gobi Desert. Since the second half of 1955, a total of 40 deep and medium-depth exploratory wells have been drilled in seven structures, including Youquanzi, Mangai, Youshashan, Lenghu No. 4, Youdunzi, Dafengshan, and Eboliang No. 2, with a total depth of more than 55,000 meters. Oil has been tested in 73 layers in 39 wells. The oil production capacity of each well is very strong. For example, in the Youquanzi structure, each of the 19 completed wells produces more than two tons of oil per day; among them, Well Youzhong No. 9 produces 30 tons per day. Another example is the Lenghu No. 4 structure, where five to seven oil layers have been found in each of the six deep exploratory wells tested. Among them, the fifth oil layer of Well Zhong-Shen No. 1 produces about six tons per day. The quality of the crude oil produced in each structure is good, especially the crude oil produced in Youquanzi and Youshashan, which does not contain water. The shallow oil layers of Youquanzi, Kaitemilike, Lenghu No. 4, and Youshashan have industrial exploitation value, and deep oil layers have also been found in Youquanzi and Lenghu No. 4, proving the existence of deep oil layers in the western and northwestern parts of the basin. The shallow oil layers encountered in the exploration of the Mahai structure are of good quality and high pressure. Electrical measurements have confirmed that there are ten good oil-bearing sandstone layers, which are better in all aspects than the four confirmed structures mentioned above. Large and medium-sized drilling rigs and their related equipment maintenance capabilities are established everywhere in the basin. The water pipeline and pumping station project from the base to the exploration area, which is more than 170 kilometers long, and the small oil refinery in Youquanzi, can process 6,800 tons of crude oil per year and can currently refine gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil. What is particularly encouraging is that a well (geological well) in the Mahai structure, drilled to a depth of 388 meters, gushed out a large amount of natural gas. In another borehole, drilled to a depth of 474 meters, an oil-bearing sandstone layer was reached, and a large amount of high-quality crude oil flowed out.
　　At the same time, according to the preliminary survey results of some mineral deposits, some of which are very promising and urgently needed by the state, in 1956, the state received 150,000 tons of metallic lead reserves, 170,000 tons of zinc, 170,000 kilograms of silver, and 340,000 kilograms of sulfur; at the end of the third quarter of 1957, 160,000 tons of lead were handed over to the state, accounting for 106.7% of the annual planned task. With the development of exploration, following the principle of "exploring and producing simultaneously," local industry has gradually developed. Cement, brick and tile, leather, iron, coal, and salt factories have been established and put into production successively. The Yuka Coal Mine alone can produce 150,000 tons of raw coal per year with its existing equipment capacity.

　　Establish State-Owned Farms According to the Principle of Thrift - Raise Various Livestock - Successful Trial Planting of Vegetables
　　From the perspective of farmland water conservancy: according to preliminary surveys in seven areas, including Mahai, Huahaizi Gas, Utumeiren, Garmu, and Da-Xiao Qaidam, there are approximately over ten million mu of grassland that can support 770,000 livestock; there are also over 700,000 mu of arable land in six areas, including Mahai and Garmu, with a year-round frost-free period of about 80 to 120 days. At the same time, there is also a considerable amount of groundwater and eight larger rivers on the surface, with a total annual flow of approximately over 150,000,000 cubic meters. In recent years, following the principles of "building the country industriously and thriftily, running enterprises industriously and thriftily" and "producing and constructing simultaneously, with less investment, quick results, and without competing with the people for profits," eight state-owned farms have been established successively, with a total of 546,158 mu of arable land and 212,390 mu of reclaimed farmland. In 1957, the sown area was 134,941 mu, producing more than 30,378,000 jin of grain; more than 780,000 jin of oilseeds; and more than 13,000,000 jin of vegetables. In addition to supplying the consumption of all farm personnel, 12,000,000 jin of surplus grain and 560,000 jin of oilseeds were sold to the state. The farms currently have 4,966 horses, mules, and cattle; 17,439 sheep; 4,364 pigs; and more than 600 chickens and ducks, which has played a positive role in increasing fertilizer and solving the meat supply for the staff and workers in the basin. Various major crops in the basin, such as wheat, highland barley, Chinese cabbage, spinach, radish, cucumber, tomato, eggplant, and more than 30 other types, have been successfully trial-planted, grow well, and have high yields. For example, the average wheat yield per mu in the Nomuhong Farm is 250 jin, and the highest yield reaches 1,482 jin, and the average vegetable yield per mu is 2,500 jin, and the highest yield reaches 10,900 jin, indicating that there is still great potential.

　　A Network of Intersecting Highways Has Been Formed - Various Institutions Such as Finance, Trade, and Service Have Been Established Along the Route
　　From the perspective of various construction projects: a network of highways centered on Da Qaidam, Garmu, and Mangai, with a total length of 4,249 kilometers, has been formed. Along the transportation lines, 112 finance, trade, service, banking, supply and marketing, and other institutions have been established, distributed in 28 areas, including Da Qaidam, Lenghu, Tanggula Mountain, and Yuka, basically forming the commercial supply network of the basin. In particular, national minority goods stores have also been established for ethnic minorities, and Da Qaidam and other seven areas have become socialist commercial markets. In addition, there are often mobile trade, banking, savings, and monopoly teams providing services to various exploration areas, small teams, nomadic tents, and state-owned farm work stations in the field. In addition, six ethnic minority schools and staff children's schools have been established, Xinhua Bookstores have been widely established, and a large number of newspapers and magazines are supplied, and film projection teams are popular throughout the basin. This not only solves the food and lodging problems of the staff and workers along the route, but also guarantees the material and cultural needs of the staff, workers, and the masses. At the same time, more than 50 health and medical institutions have been widely established in various exploration areas, mines, and farms, which has played a significant role in protecting the health of the staff, workers, farmers, and herdsmen, and in completing production tasks.
　　In addition, the basin has a large number of wild plants, such as wild hemp, ephedra, cynomorium, rhubarb, wolfberry, licorice, and sheep horn resources, to support the raw materials of light industry. The above is the general situation of the basin that I have seen and heard, which fully shows the great achievements of the current construction of the basin and its infinitely rich prospects.
　　The main reasons for the great achievements of the construction of the Qaidam Basin are: first of all, the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee. The industrial construction directly led by the Central Committee and the geological exploration and other organizations sent there have played a decisive role in local construction. At the same time, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee and the Qaidam Working Committee have resolutely implemented the Central Committee's guidelines and policies on the construction of the Qaidam Basin, and have formulated a ten-year plan for the province's development of production undertakings. According to the development of work, active measures have been taken, thus enabling the various construction projects in the Qaidam Basin to achieve great results.
　　It should be particularly pointed out here that the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union to our country is also an important factor in achieving success. This is embodied in the Soviet experts who have participated in the socialist construction of the Qaidam Basin with a selfless spirit. For example, expert Prahallov actively supported the proposals of Chinese experts and started drilling in Youshashan. He said: "I love your country as much as I love my motherland. The stronger China is, the greater the strength of the socialist camp, and the greater the guarantee of world peace." Therefore, I feel that the Soviet experts are geological experts and models of internationalism; they are our good teachers and our best friends and comrades.
　　The Workers of Factories, Farms, and Various Construction Sites Create New Production Achievements Every Moment
　　On the other hand, all the staff and workers who are engaged in construction in the factories, farms, and various construction sites in the Qaidam Basin, with the strong support of all ethnic groups in the province, have greatly improved their political and ideological level through socialist education. In the high tide of labor competition, many advanced producers and model workers have emerged. They master advanced technology and create new achievements every day and every hour. For example, the drilling team of the Petroleum Bureau continuously created new records in the second half of 1956: Initially, the 501 Drilling Team advanced 101.73 meters per day. In less than six days, the Communist Youth League Drilling Team reached 119.1 meters, and later the 507 Drilling Team reached 135.59 meters.
　　In 1957, new records continued to appear in Mangai: from a daily progress of 221.29 meters to 422.49 meters.
　　Compared with the above achievements and beautiful prospects, it is indeed a good start. I deeply realize that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the broad masses of working people be organized and can amazing miracles be created. Therefore, there is sufficient reason to say that the Communist Party of China is not only good at leading the revolution to achieve great victories, but also capable of leading science and technology and successfully building socialism. The absolute leadership of the Communist Party is the only guarantee for building socialism.
　　I believe that after the Second Five-Year Plan, the industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry of our Qinghai Province will enter a new stage of prosperity. At that time, due to the better mutual support of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, it will be more conducive to the rapid development of socialist construction.

　　柴达木盆地出现新工业城市
    松布代表谈视察柴达木盆地建设事业的观感
    我完全同意李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”和薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划的报告”，以及彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告与吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告等，并且在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    我去年十月份跟随中共青海省委、省人委组织的各级党政领导机关和各阶层人士共一百零四人的慰问团，前往柴达木盆地向全体职工人员进行慰问，并视察了盆地各项工作。现将我的观感向大会作一汇报。
    过去稀无人烟今日机器轰鸣  丰富矿藏将为祖国建设出力
    柴达木盆地拥有二十二万平方公里的面积。过去，百分之八十以上的地区都是稀无人烟，交通困难，除盆地的东南边缘，居住着不足五千户过游牧生活的蒙古族和哈萨克族外，是一个没有任何社会基础的处女地。但是自一九五四年下半年以来，经过三年多的积极建设，不但建立起三百五十多个国家机构，人口增加到四万九千四百多人，而且已建成了一个烟囱矗立、机器轰鸣的新的工业城市。
    在中国共产党和国家以及青海省党政对柴达木盆地的重视和关怀下，从一九五四年八月到现在，国家在盆地已投资了四亿七千八百多万元，派去了很多技术干部，经过勘探，证实了柴达木盆地矿种多、藏量丰富，还有大量的肥沃土地和水草丰盛的草原，为发展工、农、牧业具有广阔的前途。就资源勘探和工业建设方面来看：现已发现的矿藏有石油、铁、铜、铅、锌、锰、铬、银、硫、煤、褐煤、盐、碱、芒硝、水晶石、重晶石、石棉、石膏、天然水银等二十多种，其中最主要的是石油、盐、铅和锌。
    仅就石油来看，在短短的几年中经过地质测量，轻便钻井等工作，在戈壁滩地下已发现了圈闭良好的储油构造一百零三个，从一九五五年下半年以来，先后在油泉子、芒崖、油砂山、冷湖四号、油墩子、大风山、鄂博梁二号等七个构造上共钻深井和中深探井四十处，总进尺五万五千多公尺，在三十九口井中已试油七十三层，从试油中证明，各井产油能力很强，如油泉子构造在完钻的十九口井中，每日每井产油都在两吨以上；其中，油中九井日产达三十吨。又如冷湖四号构造在试油的六口深井中，都有五至七层油层，其中中深一井第五层油层，日产六吨左右，各构造所产原油质量良好，特别是油泉子、油砂山所产原油不含水分。油泉子、开特米里克、冷湖四号、油砂山等四个构造的浅油层都具有工业开采的价值，而且在油泉子和冷湖四号还见到深油层，从而证明盆地西部和西北部都有深油层存在，在马海构造钻探中遇到的浅油层，质量好，压力大，已经电测证实，现有十个良好的油砂层，各方面都比上面肯定的四个构造还好，盆地到处树立着大、中型钻机和其有关设备的大修能力，从基地至探区长达一百七十多公里的输水管线和泵站工程，油泉子的小型炼油厂，每年可处理原油六千八百吨，目前能炼制汽油、煤油和柴油三种产品，特别令人鼓舞的是：马海构造一口井（地质井）钻至三百八十八公尺外，喷出了大量的天然气，另一口钻孔中，钻至四百七十四公尺时，钻到了油砂层，流出了大量质量良好的原油。
    同时，就部分矿藏初步踏勘的结果，其中一些希望很大的，而且为国家迫切需要的矿藏来看，一九五六年给国家上交金属铅储量十五万吨，锌十七万吨，银十七万公斤，硫三十四万公斤；一九五七年第三季度末上交国家的铅十六万吨，为全年计划任务的百分之一百零六点七。随着勘探事业的发展，本着“边勘探，边生产”的方针，地方工业已逐步发展起来了，已建立了石灰、砖瓦、皮革、铁厂、煤矿、盐厂等厂矿，并已先后投入了生产，仅鱼卡煤矿按现有设备能力，可年产原煤十五万吨。
    根据勤俭方针　办起国营农场  饲养各种牲畜　试种蔬菜成功
    就农田水利方面来看：据初步在马海、花海子尕斯、乌图美仁、噶尔穆、大小柴旦等七个地区踏勘，约有草原一千余万亩，可载畜七十七万只；马海、噶尔穆等六个地区还有可耕地七十余万亩，全年无霜期为八十至一百二十天左右，同时还有相当充足的地下水源和地面上八条较大的河流，全年总流量约为十五万多公方。几年来，根据“勤俭建国、勤俭办企业”和“边生产，边建设，投资少，收效快，不与民争利”的方针下，先后已办了八个国营农场，现共有可耕面积五十四万六千一百五十八亩，开荒造田二十一万二千三百九十亩。一九五七年播种面积十三万四千九百四十一亩，生产粮食三千零三十七万八千多斤；油料七十八万多斤；蔬菜一千三百多万斤，除供应农场全体人员食用外，向国家出售余粮一千二百万斤，油料五十六万斤。农场现共有马、骡、牛四千九百六十六头（匹），羊一万七千四百三十九只，猪四千三百六十四头，鸡、鸭六百多只，这对增加肥料解决盆地职工的肉食供应，起了积极的作用。盆地各种主要农作物，如：小麦、青稞、白菜、菠菜、萝卜、黄瓜、西红柿、茄子等三十余种，都已试种成功，生长良好，产量也高，如诺木洪农场小麦每亩通产量二百五十斤，最高产量达到一千四百八十二斤，蔬菜每亩通产量二千五百斤，最高产量达到一万零九百斤，仍有很大的潜力。
    纵横交错的公路交通网已经形成  沿线建立财贸、服务等各种机构
    就各项建设方面来看：以大柴旦、噶尔穆、芒崖为中心，长达四千二百四十九公里，纵横交错的公路交通网已经形成，沿途交通线上已建立财贸、服务、银行、供销等机构一百一十二处，分布在大柴旦、冷湖、唐古拉山、鱼卡等二十八个地区，基本上形成了盆地的商业供应网，特别是还为少数民族设立了民族用品门市部，而且大柴旦等七个地区已成为社会主义的商业市场。此外，还经常有流动贸易、银行、储蓄、专卖等小组，到野外各探区、小队、牧民帐篷、国营农场作业站进行服务。此外，设立民族学校与职工子弟学校六所，普遍建立了新华书店，大量供应报刊杂志，电影放映队普及全盆地。这不仅解决了职工群众沿途食、宿问题，而且保证了职工与群众的物质、文化生活的需要；同时，在各探区、矿山、农场等地，已普遍设立了卫生医疗机构五十余处，这对于保障职工、农牧民的健康，和完成生产任务，起了很大的作用。
    此外，盆地还有大量的野生植物，如野麻、麻黄、锁阳、大黄、枸?、甘草及翔羊角等资源，以支援轻工业的原料，以上都是我眼见耳听的盆地的大概情况，充分地显示了盆地目前建设的很大成就和无限丰富的远景。
    柴达木的建设获得巨大成就的主要原因是：首先，党中央的正确领导。中央直接领导的工业建设和派去的地质勘探等组织，对于当地建设起了决定作用。同时，青海省委和柴达木工委，都坚决贯彻了中央关于建设柴达木的方针、政策，并且制定了省的发展生产事业的十年规划，根据工作发展情况，进行了积极措施，因而，使柴达木各项建设取得了很大成绩。
    在这里特别应该提出，苏联对于我们国家的兄弟般的援助，也是获得成绩的一个重要因素。这就体现在苏联派来的专家，他们以大公无私的精神，参加柴达木社会主义建设事业。如普拉哈洛夫专家，积极支持我国专家的主张，在油沙山开钻。他说：“我热爱你们的国家和热爱我的祖国一样，中国强盛了，社会主义阵营的力量就越大，世界和平就更有保证。”因此，我感觉：苏联专家们是地质专家，又是国际主义的典范；是我们的良好的老师，又是最好的朋友和同志。
    工厂、农场和各个工地的职工  每时每刻都创造出生产新成绩
    另一方面，在柴达木的工厂、农场和各个工地上进行建设的全体职工，他们在全省各民族的大力支援下，经过社会主义的教育，政治思想水平大大提高了，在劳动竞赛的高潮中，涌现出了很多先进生产者和模范工作者。他们掌握着先进的技术，每日每时都创造出新的成绩。如石油局钻井队在一九五六年下半年不断创造新的纪录：开始501钻井队日进一百零一点七三公尺，不到六日，共青团钻井队达到一百一十九点一公尺，后来507钻井队又达到一百三十五点五九公尺。
    一九五七年在芒崖的新纪录不断出现：由日进二百二十一点二九公尺，到达四百二十二点四九公尺。
    以上的成就和美好的远景比较起来，确是一个良好的开端。我深深认识到：只有在共产党的领导下，才能组织广大劳动群众，才能创造出惊人的奇迹。因而有充分理由说：中国共产党不仅善于领导革命取得伟大胜利，而且，能够领导科学技术和胜利地建设社会主义事业。共产党的绝对领导，是建设社会主义的唯一保证。
    我相信：经过第二个五年计划，我们青海省的工、农、牧业要进入到繁荣的新阶段，那时，由于工、农、牧业更好的互相支援，更会有利于社会主义建设的迅速发展。
