Loving the Country Means Loving the Socialist Motherland
Wu Yaozong's Speech Indicates Chinese Christians Must Resolutely Take the Socialist Road

In the past year, the international situation of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind" has made every Chinese person who loves the motherland and loves justice feel infinitely joyful and excited. Our country's first Five-Year Plan has been overfulfilled, and construction undertakings in all fields have developed by leaps and bounds. The rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle have achieved major victories, and the people of the whole country have received a profound socialist education. In this new situation, the working people's enthusiasm for building socialism is unprecedentedly high. Our country's main industrial production should strive to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom within fifteen years, or a little longer. In addition, the implementation of the Agricultural Development Program, the rectification of institutions, the transfer of cadres to lower levels, the movement to increase production and practice economy, and the patriotic health movement are all being carried out with tremendous force under the enthusiastic support of relevant departments and the people of the whole country. The Chinese character reform plan is an expression of the leap forward in our country's cultural construction. Everything in New China is full of vigor, and the Chinese people are building the motherland with the heroic spirit of riding the wind and waves. The liberated Chinese people have not only stood up, but also demonstrated endless wisdom and strength.

In the international situation, the development of Soviet science and technology has shaken the world. We have not only seen the two artificial satellites launched by the Soviet Union, but we also see the Soviet Union's ever-changing, amazing and admirable scientific and technological inventions in the daily newspapers. While achieving these outstanding achievements, the Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed its willingness for peace, which is not only reflected in concrete proposals, but also in concrete actions. The meetings and declarations of the communist and workers' parties of various countries have further made us realize the new development of the international situation which is conducive to socialist construction and world peace. Conversely, imperialism's "policy of strength" is increasingly opposed; the imperialist camp is increasingly disintegrating; anti-colonialism has formed a torrent, and in the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, this torrent showed its great potential. This series of developments in the domestic and international situation over the past year vividly and eloquently proves the superiority and justice of socialism, proves that imperialism is decadent and dying, and proves the growing determination and strength of the Chinese people and the people of the world to strive for peace and happiness.

Today, the content of patriotism is to love the socialist motherland, and the primary task of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement is to carry out socialist education among Christians across the country.

Chinese Christians, like the people of the whole country, must resolutely take the socialist road. In March 1956, the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee held its Second Plenary (Enlarged) Session. In the "Report on the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement" of this meeting, there are the following two paragraphs: "The Chinese people have chosen the road of socialism. The road of socialism is the road to abolish exploitation of man by man, oppression of man by man, and hatred of man by man; it is the road to implement mutual assistance and cooperation, equality and fraternity, and seek happiness for all the people." "Today, we have clearly seen the prospect of a prosperous and strong New China. This is what the Chinese people have dreamed of for many years. What the Chinese people want to strive to achieve is such a just, benevolent, and socialist system that conforms to our Christian faith in every way. Do we Christians have any reason not to support such a social system, but instead welcome the old Chinese society of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism that has already died?" In November 1957, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee held its Tenth (Enlarged) Session of the Standing Committee. The resolution of this meeting called on Christians across the country to "stand with the people of the whole country and resolutely take the socialist road." The resolution also said: "Now that the people of the whole country have won the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front, they have also launched the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and have also achieved a decisive victory. The meeting believes that today the content of patriotism is to love the socialist motherland, and the primary task of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement is to carry out socialist education among Christians across the country. Pastors and other responsible workers of various churches and Christian organizations should first study in depth and carry out self-reform."

Since liberation, many patriotic and religious Christians have actively participated in socialist transformation and socialist construction. We have worked hard with the people of the whole country; we have also enjoyed the happy life of socialism with the people of the whole country. There is no doubt that in today's inspiring new situation, we Christians should use a hundred times the enthusiasm, a hundred times the confidence, and use the greatest strength to work with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country that benefits the people of the whole country and the entire human race.

The thoughts, feelings and habits of life of Christians that conflict with socialism must be completely eliminated; only by gaining the standpoint and viewpoint of the people can we happily take the socialist road.

It is not without difficulties for Chinese Christians to accept the leadership of the Communist Party, carry out socialist education, and take the socialist road. First of all, many of us Christians have been deeply influenced by the old society. The bourgeoisie used to be the most important component of our church; in the old China of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism, we had a myriad of connections with the bourgeoisie; many of our churches in cities and villages were controlled by the bourgeoisie and landlords and rich peasants. Therefore, among Christians, bourgeois thoughts, feelings and habits of life exist to a greater or lesser extent.

Secondly, the socialist road is the road opened up by the October Revolution, a road that human history has never taken, and it is a earth-shaking transformation of human society. This transformation has changed the ownership of the means of production, and has brought about major changes in our entire social life. In this transformation, the personal and temporary interests of some people are inevitably in conflict with the new society. If we have not acquired new viewpoints and new standpoints, if we are unwilling to look at problems from the perspective of the overall and long-term interests of the people, we will feel unaccustomed to new things, feel incompatible, and even adopt an attitude of opposition and resistance to new things. We Christians have long been influenced by imperialism's anti-Soviet and anti-communist, pro-American and worship-American, and hypocritical bourgeois democratic and free thought, and we are more likely to have dissatisfied emotions towards new things.

We must completely eliminate our thoughts, feelings and habits of life that conflict with socialism, whether they come from the old society or from the Western bourgeoisie; we must obtain the viewpoint of the people and the standpoint of the people in order to resolutely and happily take the socialist road.

There is no contradiction between loving the country and loving the church. Under the premise of loving the country, those who believe in religion and those who do not have a common foundation, and this foundation is to work hard for the construction of the motherland.

In addition to the above issues, Christians taking the socialist road will also encounter some issues related to religious beliefs, among which the more prominent one is whether there is a contradiction between loving the country and loving the church. Christians are Chinese people, so of course they must love the country; Christians are religious believers, so of course they must love the church, and there should not be any contradiction between the two. But some people say: In the socialist New China, there is a contradiction between those who believe and those who do not, between those who believe in God and those who do not, and they regard this contradiction as a contradiction between loving the country and loving the church. We believe this is a wrong view.

In the years after the launch of the Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement, we have gradually reached a positive conclusion on the relationship between loving the country and loving the church. We say: Loving the country and loving the church are completely consistent and there is no contradiction. We say: Under the premise of loving the country, those who believe and those who do not have a common foundation, and both those who believe and those who do not can work hard for the construction of the motherland.

In the past few years, we have had a profound understanding of the New China's policy of freedom of religious belief. This policy is not only expressly stipulated in the Constitution, but also strongly implemented by the government. There is no room for doubt about the authenticity of the New China's policy of freedom of religious belief. In some places, there are still some deviations in the implementation of the religious policy; but this is only a problem in the implementation of the religious policy, not a problem of the religious policy itself, and these deviations have gradually been corrected.

In the New China, religious belief is completely free. Conversely, in imperialist countries that use "the free world" as a guise, like the United States, their freedom of religious belief is being increasingly restricted. Near New York, a young Episcopalian pastor, W.H. Merris, was driven out of the church by his superior bishop for advocating justice and peace in his sermons. Although the church's masses advocated justice and protested to the bishop, and despite the long struggle by Merris himself and his father, it was still ineffective. The Powell case is also a prominent example of the American rulers depriving the people of freedom of speech.

We say: Under the premise of loving the country, those who believe and those who do not have a common foundation. If this is the case, then at present, when the people of the whole country are joyfully engaged in socialist construction, the most important issue for us Christians should not be the internal contradiction between the people who believe and those who do not, but how to work with the people of the whole country to build socialism. Building socialism is the duty of Christians who are Chinese people, and it is also the duty of Christians who are religious believers. There is a saying in the Bible: "Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone." For us Christians, the socialist road that the 600 million people of New China and more than one-third of the people of the world have decided to take today should be what is "right in the eyes of everyone." Christians taking the socialist road will be pleasing to everyone, the work of the church will be done better, and the contradiction between those who believe and those who do not can be better handled. We do not take the socialist road because it is good for Christianity; we take the socialist road under the understanding that loving the country and loving the church are completely consistent. We believe that whether from a political point of view or from a religious point of view, we Christians can feel at ease and joyful to take the socialist road with the people of the whole country.

A number of right-wing elements have been exposed within Christianity, their religious cloaks have been stripped off, and their ugly and sinister true colors have been exposed. They are the enemies of all patriotic and religious Christians.

In November 1957, at the Tenth (Enlarged) Session of the Standing Committee of the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, we exposed several right-wing elements within Christianity; in Christian communities in various places, some right-wing elements were also exposed. Right-wing elements within Christianity, like other right-wing elements, are anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist. Right-wing elements within Christianity, like other right-wing elements, also wear some cloaks; right-wing elements within Christianity also wear a special cloak, which is a religious cloak. Right-wing elements within Christianity say: "Socialism is not as good as the past; people are about to die, what future is there?" They say: "Hong Kong has freedom, the United Kingdom and the United States have freedom, but New China does not have freedom." They say: "The Communist Party is atheist and cannot lead the religious community; laymen cannot lead experts." They say: "The religious policy is false, the Communist Party wants to eliminate religion." They say: "The Three-Self Movement is a mess, how can people not think of imperialism?" Right-wing elements within Christianity particularly emphasize the contradiction between those who believe in God and those who do not, and describe this internal contradiction of the people as an irreconcilable contradiction between the enemy and us.

Right-wing elements within Christianity wear religious cloaks and use "faith" as an air-raid shelter. They deceive the masses of believers, attempting to make the masses of believers believe that right-wing elements are anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist for the sake of "faith," and believe that they are undermining the Three-Self Movement also for the sake of "faith." In this expanded meeting of the Three-Self Standing Committee, many Christian colleagues used vivid, concrete, and personal experiences to explain how miserable and dark the old society was, and how prosperous and flourishing the New China is. They explained that the "freedom" of Hong Kong and the "freedom" of the United Kingdom and the United States are the freedom of reactionaries and rulers riding on the heads of the people, not the freedom of the oppressed and exploited people to strive for survival and happiness; conversely, the freedom of New China is the true freedom of the broad masses of people in politics, ideology, and life, which is the dictatorship over the reactionary elements. The colleagues pointed out the many cares and assistance that the Party and the government have given to the religious community since liberation, but have never interfered in religious belief. They also cited many concrete examples to prove the achievements of the government in implementing the religious policy. They affirmed the great achievements of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement in recent years, and explained that the reason why right-wing elements oppose the Three-Self Movement is only because they want to take the old road of capitalism and return to the embrace of imperialism. Through airing views freely, presenting facts, reasoning, and conducting great debates, the reactionary words and deeds of the right-wing elements were exposed and refuted; their religious cloaks were stripped off; their ugly, sinister, and cunning true colors were exposed. Many facts have proven that they neither love the country nor love the church; they are the enemies of the Chinese people and the enemies of all patriotic and religious Christians.

Right-wing elements within Christianity have direct or indirect relations with imperialism and reactionaries. They faithfully carried out the instruction of imperialism that "Christianity must be anti-communist," they are people appreciated by imperialism, and their words and deeds are applauded by imperialism. At present, one of the main ways imperialism uses religion to carry out aggression is to attempt to use religion to carry out instigation and create division within socialist countries. In the Hungarian incident in October 1956, an important international Christian organization openly supported the reactionary forces within the Hungarian church, forcing the progressive leaders within the Hungarian church to resign, attempting to turn the Hungarian church into an important stronghold for subverting the Hungarian people's regime. Similarly, right-wing elements within our country's Christianity serve imperialism and play an internal role in imperialism's policy of aggression.

Since the crimes of the right-wing elements within Christianity are so serious, we must never be gentle with them. We must seriously criticize their reactionary words and deeds, thoroughly strip off their religious cloaks, and draw a clear line between ourselves and them. Right-wing elements within Christianity must frankly confess, thoroughly change their stand, and start anew, otherwise they will be cutting themselves off from the people.

Chinese Christians taking the socialist road will bring new direction and new content to the Christian Three-Self Movement.

The Three-Self Movement is a patriotic movement; loving the country means loving the socialist New China and striving to build socialism. For us Christians, loving the country should have the following meanings: First, we should actively participate in socialist construction work in our respective positions. Second, when we carry out Christian work, we should consider whether what we do is in line with the situation of socialist society; we should eliminate localism and subjectivism, and consider issues from the perspective of the interests of 600 million people. Third, we should continue to study diligently, remove all our thoughts that conflict with socialism, improve our working methods and work style, and rectify our organizational structure so that we can play a positive role in the socialist New China. Fourth, we must not only continue to struggle against right-wing elements, but we must also expose and criticize many illegal, undisciplined, anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist crimes that are currently being committed inside and outside the church under the guise of Christianity, and ask the government to deal with them according to law.

The Three-Self Movement is also an anti-imperialist movement. In today's new international situation, for us Christians, anti-imperialism should have the following meanings: First, we must not only sever tangible relations with imperialism, but we must also sever intangible relations with imperialism; continue to eliminate the ideological toxins of imperialism, eliminate all our illusions about imperialism, and thoroughly understand the reactionary and decadent nature of imperialism. Second, we must be vigilant against the conspiracy of imperialism to use religious feelings to carry out instigation and create division. Our clear and firm stand on socialism is the most powerful answer to imperialism's reactionary propaganda that "Christianity must be anti-communist." Third, we should raise the awareness of the international situation among Christians across the country, actively support all undertakings that are conducive to socialist construction and defending world peace, and resolutely oppose imperialism's tricks to create wars and enslave the people.

Taking the socialist road must be translated into practical action, and Christians carrying out anti-imperialist and patriotic work is the most concrete action of taking the socialist road.

Taking the socialist road is not empty talk; taking the socialist road must be translated into practical action. We Christians actively carrying out the above-mentioned anti-imperialist and patriotic work is the most concrete action of our taking the socialist road.

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and under the encouragement and education of several vigorous movements in our country, Chinese Christians have denounced imperialism, severed relations with imperialism, and exposed some anti-revolutionary groups within Christianity that served imperialism, making the Chinese church a church managed by Chinese believers themselves, and making the broad masses of believers receive patriotic education. This socialist education movement and the struggle against right-wing elements within Christianity conducted by Christians across the country this time will further bring Chinese Christians closely together with the broad masses of people, and contribute greater strength to building socialism and defending world peace in the vibrant New China.

    爱国就是要爱社会主义的祖国
    吴耀宗代表发言表示中国基督徒要坚决走社会主义道路
    在过去一年中，“东风压倒西风”的国际形势使每一个爱祖国、爱正义的中国人都感到无比的欢欣，无比的兴奋。我国第一个五年计划已经超额完成，各方面的建设事业突飞猛进地发展。整风运动和反右派斗争已经取得重大的胜利，全国人民受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育。在这个新形势中，劳动人民建设社会主义的热情，空前高涨。我国的主要工业生产，要争取在十五年内，或者稍多一点的时间内，赶上或者超过英国。此外，农业发展纲要的推行，机关的整改，干部的下放，增产节约运动，爱国卫生运动，都在有关部门和全国人民热烈拥护下，以雷霆万钧的力量来进行。汉字改革方案更是我国文化建设飞跃前进的表现。新中国的一切都充满了蓬勃的朝气，中国人民正在以乘风破浪的英雄气概来建设祖国。解放了的中国人民不但站立起来，而且显示了无穷无尽的智慧和力量。
    在国际局势中，苏联科学技术的发展，震动了全世界。我们不但看见苏联所发射的两颗人造卫星，我们也在每天的报纸上看见苏联日新月异、使人惊奇赞叹的科学技术的发明。在取得这些卓越成就的同时，苏联一次又一次地表达了它的和平意愿，这些和平意愿，不但见之于具体的建议，也见之于具体的行动。各国共产党和工人党的会议和宣言更使我们认识到有利于社会主义建设和世界和平的国际形势的新发展。相反地，帝国主义的“实力政策”愈来愈遭受反对；帝国主义阵营，日益分崩离析；反殖民主义已经形成一股洪流，在亚非人民团结大会中，这股洪流显出它的巨大的潜力。一年来国内国际形势这一系列的发展，生动地、雄辩地证明了社会主义的优越性和正义性，证明了帝国主义是腐朽的、垂死的，证明了中国人民和全世界人民为争取和平、幸福而斗争的不断增涨的决心和力量。
    今天爱国主义的内容就是爱社会主义的祖国，三自爱国运动当前的首要任务就是在全国基督徒中进行社会主义教育
    中国基督徒，同全中国人民一样，要坚决地走社会主义道路。一九五六年三月，中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会举行第二次全体委员（扩大）会议。在这个会议的“关于中国基督教三自爱国运动的报告”中，有下面的两段话：“中国人民选择了社会主义的道路。社会主义的道路是废除人剥削人、人压迫人、人仇视人的道路；是实行互助合作、平等友爱、为全体人民谋幸福的道路。”“今天，我们已经清楚地看见一个繁荣富强的新中国的远景。这是多少年来中国人民所梦寐以求的。中国人民所要努力实现的就是这样一个公义的、仁爱的、处处符合我们基督徒信仰的社会主义制度。难道我们基督徒还有什么理由不拥护这样的社会制度，反而欢迎那已经死去的半封建半殖民地的旧中国社会吗？”一九五七年十一月，三自爱国运动委员会举行常务委员会第十次（扩大）会议，这个会议的决议，号召全国基督徒“必须和全国人民在一起，坚决地走社会主义道路”。决议又说：“现在全国人民在取得经济战线上的社会主义革命胜利以后，又展开了政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，并且也取得了决定性的胜利。会议认为，今天爱国主义的内容就是爱社会主义的祖国，三自爱国运动当前的首要任务就是在全国基督徒中进行社会主义教育。各教会和基督教团体的教牧人员，以及其他负责同工，应该首先深入学习，进行自我改造”。
    解放以来，许多爱国爱教的基督徒积极地参加了社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业。我们同全国人民在一起，进行了辛勤的劳动；我们也同全国人民在一起，享受了社会主义的幸福生活。毫无疑问，在今天令人欢欣鼓舞的新形势中，我们基督徒应当以百倍的热情、百倍的信心，拿出最大的力量，同全国人民在一起，在共产党的领导下，把我们的国家建设成一个繁荣富强，为全国人民造福，也为全体人类造福的社会主义国家。
    基督徒同社会主义相抵触的思想感情和生活习惯必须彻底消除；取得人民的立场、人民的观点才能愉快地走社会主义道路
    中国基督徒接受共产党领导、进行社会主义教育、走社会主义道路，不是没有困难的。首先，我们基督徒中有许多人受过旧社会深刻的影响。资产阶级曾经是我们教会中一个最重要的组成部分；在半封建半殖民地的旧中国里，我们同资产阶级发生过千丝万缕的关系；我们城市和乡村的教会有不少被资产阶级和地主富农所支配。因此，在基督徒中，资产阶级的思想情感和生活习惯都或多或少地存在着。
    其次，社会主义道路是十月革命所开辟的，人类历史所没有走过的道路，是人类社会天翻地覆的变革。这个变革改变了生产资料的所有制，使我们全部社会生活发生了重大的变化。在这变革中，有些人个人的、暂时的利害，免不了同新社会发生冲突。如果我们没有取得新的观点、新的立场，如果我们不肯从全体人民长远利益出发去看问题，我们对新事物就会感到不习惯，感到格格不入，甚至对新事物采取对立、反抗的态度。我们基督徒长期受过帝国主义反苏反共、亲美崇美和虚伪的资产阶级民主自由思想的影响，我们更容易对新事物产生不满的情绪。
    我们同社会主义抵触的思想情感和生活习惯，不管是从旧社会来的，或是从西方资产阶级来的，我们都必须彻底地消除；我们必须取得人民的观点，人民的立场，才能坚决地、愉快地走社会主义道路。
    爱国与爱教没有矛盾，在爱国的前提下，信教与不信教有共同的基础，这个基础就是为祖国的建设努力
    除了上述问题以外，基督徒走社会主义道路还会碰到一些与宗教信仰有关的问题，其中比较突出的就是爱国与爱教有没有矛盾的问题。基督徒是中国人民，当然要爱国；基督徒是宗教信仰者，也当然要爱教，在这两者之间，不应当存在着什么矛盾。但有人说：在社会主义的新中国里，在信与不信之间，在有神无神之间，存在着矛盾，他们就把这个矛盾，看作是爱国同爱教的矛盾，我们认为这是一个错误的看法。
    在基督教三自爱国运动发起后的几年中，我们对爱国和爱教的关系这个问题逐渐得到了肯定的结论。我们说：爱国爱教完全一致，没有矛盾。我们说：在爱国的前提下，信与不信有共同的基础，信与不信都可以为祖国的建设努力。
    这几年来，我们对新中国宗教信仰自由政策，有了深刻的认识。这个政策不但在宪法里明文规定，也得到政府大力的贯彻和执行。新中国宗教信仰自由政策的真实性已经没有怀疑的余地。在有些地方，宗教政策在执行上还存在着一些偏差；但这只是宗教政策在执行上的问题，而不是宗教政策本身的问题，而且这些偏差已经逐渐得到纠正。
    在新中国里，宗教信仰是完全自由的。相反地，以“自由世界”作幌子的帝国主义国家，像美国，他们的宗教信仰自由却受到越来越大的限制。在纽约附近一位年青的圣公会牧师W．H．梅里时因为在讲道中主张正义与和平，就被他的上级主教赶出教堂，虽然教会的群众主张公道，向主教提出抗议，并经过梅里时自己和他的父亲的长期斗争，还是无效。鲍惠尔的案件，也是美国统治者剥夺人民言论自由一个突出的例子。
    我们说：在爱国的前提下，信与不信有共同的基础。既是这样，在目前全国人民欢欣鼓舞地从事社会主义建设的时候，我们基督徒最重要的问题，应当不是信与不信的人民内部矛盾的问题，而是如何同全国人民在一起，建设社会主义的问题。建设社会主义是作为中国人民的基督徒的本份，同时也是作为宗教信仰者的基督徒的本份。圣经上有一句话说：“众人以为美的事要留心去做。”对我们基督徒来说，今天新中国六亿人民和全世界三分之一以上的人民所决定要走的社会主义道路，应当就是“众人以为美”的事。基督徒走社会主义道路就会得到众人的喜悦，教会的工作就会做得更好，信与不信的矛盾就能得到更好的处理。我们不是因为走社会主义道路对基督教有好处，才走社会主义道路；我们是在爱国爱教完全一致的认识下走社会主义道路。我们认为：无论从政治的观点来说，或是从宗教的观点来说，我们基督徒都可以心安理得、欢欣愉快地，同全国人民一起，走社会主义道路。
    基督教内揭发一批右派分子，剥下他们的宗教外衣，丑恶阴险的原形暴露了。他们是一切爱国爱教的基督徒的敌人
    一九五七年十一月，在中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会常务委员会第十次（扩大）会议上，我们揭发了几个基督教内的右派分子；在各地的基督教里面，也揭发了一些右派分子。基督教内的右派分子，同其他的右派分子一样，都是反党、反人民、反社会主义的。基督教内的右派分子，也同其他右派分子一样，都披着一些外衣；基督教内的右派分子还披着一件特别的外衣，就是宗教外衣。基督教内的右派分子说：“社会主义是今不如昔；人快要死了，还有什么前途。”他们说：“香港有自由，英美有自由，新中国没有自由。”他们说：“共产党是无神论者，不能领导宗教界，外行不能领导内行。”他们说：“宗教政策是假的，共产党要消灭宗教。”他们说：“三自运动搞得一团糟，如何叫人不想帝国主义。”基督教内的右派分子特别强调有神无神的矛盾，把这个人民内部的矛盾，说成是你死我活的敌我矛盾。
    基督教内的右派分子披着宗教外衣，以“信仰”为防空洞。他们欺骗信徒群众，企图使信徒群众相信右派分子反党、反人民、反社会主义是为了“信仰”，相信他们破坏三自运动，也是为了“信仰”。在这次三自常委扩大会议中，许多基督教的同工用生动、具体、亲身体验的事实来说明旧社会怎样的悲惨黑暗，新中国怎样的欣欣向荣。他们说明了香港的“自由”、英美的“自由”，是反动派和统治者骑在人民头上的自由，而不是被压迫、被剥削的人民争取生存和幸福的自由；相反的，新中国的自由是对反动分子专政的广大人民在政治上、思想上、生活上的真正自由。同工们指出了解放后党和政府对宗教界许多的关怀和帮助，但从来没有干涉宗教信仰。他们也举出许多具体事例，证明政府贯彻宗教政策的成绩。他们肯定了三自爱国运动这几年来的巨大成就，说明了右派分子所以反对三自运动，只是因为他们要走资本主义的老路，要回到帝国主义的怀抱。通过大鸣大放，摆事实、讲道理、大辩论，右派分子的反动言行被揭发、被驳倒了；他们的宗教外衣被剥下了；他们丑恶、阴险、狡猾的原形暴露了。许多事实证明了他们既不爱国，也不爱教；他们是中国人民的敌人，是一切爱国爱教的基督徒的敌人。
    基督教内的右派分子同帝国主义和反动派都有直接或间接的关系。他们忠实地执行了帝国主义“基督教必须反共”的指示，他们是帝国主义所赏识的人，他们的言行得到帝国主义的喝采。目前帝国主义利用宗教来进行侵略的主要方式之一，就是企图在社会主义国家里面，利用宗教来进行挑拨离间，制造分裂。在一九五六年十月匈牙利事变中，一个重要的国际基督教组织，就公开地扶植匈牙利教会内的反动力量，迫使匈牙利教会内的进步领袖辞职，企图把匈牙利教会变成颠覆匈牙利人民政权的一个重要据点。我国基督教内的右派分子，同样地替帝国主义服务，为帝国主义的侵略政策起内线作用。
    基督教内右派分子的罪恶既是这样的严重，我们就绝对不能对他们温情。我们必须严肃地批判他们的反动言行，彻底地剥去他们的宗教外衣，同他们划清敌我界限。基督教内的右派分子必须坦白交代，彻底改变他们的立场，重新做人，否则他们就是自绝于人民。
    中国基督徒走社会主义道路，将会给基督教的三自运动带来新的方向和新的内容
    中国基督徒走社会主义道路，将会给基督教的三自运动带来新的方向和新的内容。
    三自运动是爱国的运动；爱国就是爱社会主义的新中国，为建设社会主义而努力。对我们基督徒来说，爱国应当有下列的含义：第一，我们应当在各自的岗位上，积极地参加社会主义建设工作。第二，我们在进行基督教工作的时候，应当考虑我们所做的是否符合社会主义社会的情况；我们应当消除本位主义和主观主义，从六亿人民利益的观点出发去考虑问题。第三，我们应当继续不断地认真学习，去掉我们一切与社会主义抵触的思想，改进我们的工作方法和工作作风，整顿我们的组织机构，使我们更能在社会主义的新中国里，发生积极的作用。第四，我们不但要继续同右派分子进行斗争，我们也要对目前在教会内外假借基督教名义来做的，许多违法乱纪、反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪行，进行揭露和批判，并请政府依法予以处理。
    三自运动也是反帝的运动。在今天国际的新形势下，对我们基督徒来说，反帝应当有下列的含义：第一，我们不但要割断与帝国主义有形的关系，我们也要割断与帝国主义无形的关系；继续肃清帝国主义的思想毒素，肃清我们对帝国主义的一切幻想，彻底认识帝国主义的反动性和腐朽性。第二，我们必须警惕帝国主义利用宗教情感来进行挑拨离间、制造分裂的阴谋。我们对社会主义明确而坚定的立场，就是我们对帝国主义“基督教必须反共”的反动宣传最有力的回答。第三，我们应当提高全国基督徒对国际形势的认识，积极拥护一切有利于社会主义建设和保卫世界和平的事业，坚决反对帝国主义制造战争、奴役人民的诡计。
    走社会主义道路要见诸实际行动，基督徒进行反帝爱国工作，就是走社会主义道路的最具体的行动
    走社会主义道路不是一句空话；走社会主义道路要见之于实际的行动。我们基督徒积极进行上述反帝爱国工作，就是我们走社会主义道路最具体的行动。
    解放以后，在党和政府的领导下，在我国几个轰轰烈烈的大运动的鼓舞和教育下，中国基督徒控诉了帝国主义，割断了同帝国主义的关系，揭发了基督教内一些替帝国主义服务的反革命集团，使中国教会成为中国信徒自己管理的教会，使广大信徒受到了爱国主义教育。这一次全国基督徒所进行的社会主义教育运动，和对基督教内右派分子的斗争，必将进一步使中国基督徒同广大人民紧密地站在一起，在朝气蓬勃的新中国里，为建设社会主义和保卫世界和平，贡献出更大的力量。
