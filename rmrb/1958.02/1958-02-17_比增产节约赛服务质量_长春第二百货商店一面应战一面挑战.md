Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 19th: The Changchun No. 2 Department Store responded enthusiastically to the revolutionary initiative of the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store, actively accepting the challenge and launching a competition among commercial employees in Jilin Province.

The slogan proposed by the store's employees is: "Compare drive, break conventions, surpass 'Tianqiao', and strive for the top." Their competition conditions are: (1) Among the existing 488 employees, reduce the workforce by 30%. After the staff reduction, do not shorten business hours, but also increase sales volume. (2) In terms of service quality, most employees have already met the service attitude standards set by the store last year. At the end of last year, three more items were added: complete variety of goods, specifications, and colors; clean and beautiful display of goods; and no errors or accidents during sales. (3) Strive to eliminate the phenomenon of lost goods and shortages. By the end of the year, the proportion of losses from lost goods and shortages in sales should be reduced from 1/10,000 last year to 0.3/10,000. (4) Reduce costs to surpass "Tianqiao". The cost level for 1958 is required to be 1.2% lower than in 1957. Accelerate capital turnover, purchase goods in a planned manner, and save a total of 430,000 yuan in capital and reduce expenses by 136,000 yuan.

    比增产节约赛服务质量
    长春第二百货商店一面应战一面挑战
    据新华社长春19日电　长春市百货公司第二商店响应北京天桥百货商场的革命倡议，积极应战，并向吉林省商业职工发起竞赛。
    这个商店职工提出的口号是：“比干劲、破常规、过‘天桥’、争上游”。他们的竞赛条件是：（1）在现有四百八十八名职工中，减少人员30％，人员减少后，不缩短营业时间，还要扩大卖钱额。（2）服务质量方面，商店去年规定的服务态度标准，大部分职工已经达到。去年底又增加三项内容：商品品种规格花色齐全；商品陈列清洁美观；售货时不发生差错事故。（3）力争杜绝丢货少款现象，到年底，丢货少款损失在售货额中占的比例，要由去年的万分之一降低到万分之零点三。（4）降低费用赶过“天桥”。1958年费用水平要求比1957年降低1.2％。加快资金周转，有计划地进货，共节省资金四十三万元，减少费用十三万六千元。
