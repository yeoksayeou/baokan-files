　　Deepen Propaganda, Specific Planning, Organize Observation
　　Fujian's Eliminate-the-Four-Pests Battle Moves Towards Greater Depth

　　(Our report) At present, the Eliminate-the-Four-Pests movement in Fujian Province is broad in scope, progressing quickly, large in scale, strong in momentum, and high in confidence. Especially in the last ten days, the movement has progressed rapidly, and has developed from urban areas to the countryside. As of January 28th, according to incomplete statistics from five cities, three special districts (Nanping, Fu'an, Longyan) and ten counties, more than 2.85 million rats, 556,000 sparrows, more than 6,900 catties of flies, more than 13,300 catties of mosquitoes have been eliminated, and more than 2.70 million dan of fertilizer have been accumulated. The characteristics of the movement in Fujian Province are as follows:

　　Extensive and in-depth mobilization of the masses, adopting diverse methods to carry out propaganda activities, truly achieving "known to every family" and "every household mobilized, everyone involved." Generally, counties and districts have held telephone conferences, broadcast mobilization meetings, mass oath-taking rallies, and experience exchange meetings for activists to mobilize the masses at all levels, so that the movement quickly formed a climax. Fuzhou, Xiamen and other cities also used mobile broadcasting propaganda vehicles to teach methods and experiences in eradicating the four pests along the way, and used street plays, Ping operas and other forms to carry out propaganda. Many units also used big-character posters to praise and criticize. Young people stand at the forefront of the movement. Many housewives are also mobilized, and regard eliminating the four pests as one of the important housework. For example, Lin Juanping, a "Five-Good" activist in Fuzhou City, is determined to transform her family into a "Four-Without" home, and her neighborhood into a "Four-Without" alley. Cadres working in the countryside actively participate in production and throw themselves into the Eliminate-the-Four-Pests movement.

　　Leaders take the lead and secretaries take command. The Provincial Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, with Ye Fei and Wei Jinshui as the director and deputy director, personally deploy and inspect. Most of the Party and government leaders and responsible comrades of the troops personally took the lead, driving the vast number of cadres, soldiers and the masses to invest in the movement, and improved the masses’ confidence in eliminating the four pests. In Zhangzhou City, three municipal party committee secretaries and three mayors and deputy mayors led more than 2,000 cadres and nearly 10,000 people to attack "dead corners." The person in charge of the municipal party committee also personally led a working group to go deep into the residents to publicize and help eliminate the four pests.

　　There are specific plans, and the blitz movement is combined with the regularization of the movement. Yong'an County adopted the "three-package" method of package by level, package by block, and package by item, and the communes formulated rules, and every household formulated a covenant. Pucheng County plans to achieve "Four-Without" within five years, divided into three years of blitz and two years of mopping up; among the four pests, mosquitoes and flies are for two years of blitz and two years of mopping up; rats are for two years of blitz and one year of mopping up; sparrows are for four years of blitz and one year of mopping up. In this way, the masses have clear fighting goals, and they will use the method of carrying out the blitz movement to solve a large number of problems, and adopt the method of regularizing the movement to clear the tail, so as not to allow the four pests to rise again, so as to completely eliminate the four pests.

　　Cultivate advanced models, organize observations, and promote the progress of the movement. Zhangzhou City, which won the provincial advanced title in eliminating the four pests in 1956, proposed that the whole city should be mobilized to ensure that this year it will become a "Four-Without" city, and challenged Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Nanping and other cities, thereby promoting the Eliminate-the-Four-Pests movement in various cities. In the movement, many advanced areas and advanced figures continue to emerge, and all localities have paid timely attention to summing up experiences and promoting them. For example, Putian County took Tingqi's rat-free village as a model and organized visits; Zhangpu County held a meeting in Xiatan Township, which won the national patriotic health model township title in 1952, and promoted the experiences of these advanced areas. The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China plans to organize a provincial observation and exchange conference in Zhangzhou City and Xiatan Township after the Spring Festival, and adopt the method of advanced areas leading the backward areas to achieve balanced development of the movement.

　　From the perspective of the entire province, there are also some shortcomings and problems in the development of the movement. The main ones are that the leaders in some areas have not paid enough attention to the movement, the masses have not been fully mobilized, and the momentum is insufficient. In some areas, the Eliminate-the-Four-Pests movement is not closely integrated with the current production movement; the propaganda and education of the patriotic health movement in cities is not universal enough, so that some places have appeared to steal rats and sell sparrows and other phenomena of simply pursuing numbers. In addition, some areas have not paid enough attention to eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds and dead corners. In counties where schistosomiasis is prevalent, the disease has not been well combined with water conservancy construction to vigorously eliminate snails.

　　The province plans to further launch another province-wide, blitz-style Eliminate-the-Four-Pests movement before and after the Spring Festival to continue pushing the movement to a new climax. At present, all localities are formulating or revising specific plans to strive to achieve "Four-Without" province within five years.

### 深入宣传具体规划组织观摩  福建除四害战斗向纵深发展

　　深入宣传具体规划组织观摩
    福建除四害战斗向纵深发展
    本报讯　目前福建省除四害运动面广，进展快，规模大，劲头足，信心高；特别是最近十天来，运动进展迅速，已从城镇向农村深入开展。截至1月28日止，根据五个市、三个专区（南平、福安、龙岩）及十个县不完全统计，已经消灭老鼠二百八十五万多只，麻雀五十五万六千多只，苍蝇六千九百多斤，蚊子一万三千三百多斤，堆积肥料二百七十万零二千多担。福建省运动的特点如下：
    广泛深入地发动群众，采取多种多样的方法展开宣传活动，真正做到“家喻户晓”“户户动员，人人动手”。各地一般都召开了县、区电话会议、广播动员会、群众誓师大会和积极分子经验交流会等，层层发动群众，使运动迅速形成高潮。福州、厦门等市还运用巡回广播宣传车沿途讲授扑灭四害的方法和经验，并以街头剧、评剧等形式进行宣传。不少单位还运用大字报进行表扬和批评。青少年站在运动的最前列。许多家庭妇女也动员起来，并把除四害当作重要家务之一，如福州市的“五好”积极分子林娟萍决心把自己的家庭变成为“四无”家，所在里弄成为“四无”巷。在农村中的下放干部，一面积极参加生产，一面投入除四害运动。
    领导亲自动手，书记挂帅。该省爱国卫生运动委员会以叶飞和魏金水为正副主任，亲自部署、检查。大部分地区的党、政领导和驻军负责同志都亲自动手，带动广大干部、官兵和群众投入运动，提高了群众除四害的信心。漳州市曾由三个市委书记和三个正副市长率领干部二千多人和群众近万人突击“死角”，市委负责同志还亲自带领工作组，深入居民边宣传、边帮助除四害。
    有具体规划，并使突击运动与运动经常化结合起来。永安县采取层层包、块块包、条条包的“三包”办法，社社订规刘，家家订公约。浦城县规划五年内实现“四无”，分为三年突击，二年扫尾；在四害中蚊子、苍蝇为二年突击，二年扫尾；老鼠为二年突击，一年扫尾；麻雀为四年突击，一年扫尾。这样群众奋斗目标明确，既要用开展突击运动的办法解决大量的问题，又采取使运动经常化的办法扫清尾巴，不使四害再起，以达到彻底消灭四害。
    培养先进典型，组织观摩，推动运动前进。1956年获得全省除四害先进称号的漳州市，提出全市动员，保证今年做到“四无”市，并与福州、厦门、泉州、南平等市挑战，从而推动了各市的除四害运动。运动中不断涌现出许多先进地区和先进人物，各地均及时注意总结经验，加以推广。如莆田县以汀岐无鼠村为典型，组织参观；漳浦县在获得1952年全国爱国卫生模范乡称号的霞昙乡举行会议，把这些先进地区的经验加以推广。中共福建省委准备于春节后在漳州市和霞昙乡组织全省性观摩交流大会，采取以先进带动落后的办法，使运动达到平衡发展。
    从全省来看，运动开展中也存在一些缺点和问题，主要是有些地区的领导上对运动还未十分重视，群众还未充分发动，劲头表现不足，有的地区除四害运动与当前生产运动紧密结合不够；城市中爱国卫生运动的宣传教育还不够普遍，以致有些地方出现了偷鼠卖雀等单纯追求数字的现象。此外，有的地区对消灭蚊、蝇孳生地带和死角注意不够。在有血吸虫病流行地区的县，还没有很好结合兴修水利，大力灭螺。
    该省计划在春节前后再深入发动一次全省性、突击性的除四害运动，继续把运动推向新的高潮。目前各地正在分别制订或修正具体计划，争取在五年内实现“四无”省。
