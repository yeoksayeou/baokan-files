    In Front of the Calendar
    Lü Lin
    This year's calendar, printed by the Science Popularization Publishing House, has a feature that past calendars didn't have: on each page, a line is printed: "Today is the ××th day of the year, and there are ××× days left in the year." On each page, although its font size is much smaller than the font size of the date that the calendar mainly aims to show, when you turn over a page every day, it is more conspicuous in front of you than the font size indicating the date—because it sharply touches your concept of life.

    One concept of life is: wait until the end of the year, and recall the life of this year in peace and quiet. Every day you eat better than the average person, dress better than the average person, and have more material and spiritual enjoyment than the average person, so you can have no regrets compared to the average person. Even a lifetime is the same. Based on this concept, when you are still alive, you try to eat better when you eat, and you try to dress more beautifully when you dress; whenever you encounter any opportunity for material and spiritual enjoyment, you try not to let it go. Every time after such a day, you feel that this day is the most meaningful to you and has not been wasted at all.

    Another concept of life is: wait until the end of the year, and recall this year in peace and quiet. Compared to the average person, you can also have no regrets. The same is true for a lifetime. Because, although you as a person will soon no longer exist, everything you have done has always been done; as long as it is beneficial to the people, even if it is subtle, invisible, and unknown, since it has been done, it must have played a certain role in benefiting the people in objective terms, and thus will leave a certain influence that is beneficial to the people. Based on this concept, in the present when you are still alive, you try to do as much work as you need to do; whenever you encounter something you can do, you try to do it well. Whenever a day passes, you will be alert: this means that there is one less day that you can work in this world; whenever there are not many things to do or you do not do well in a day, you will deeply regret: this day has been wasted for yourself.

    So, in front of the calendar, with what kind of concept—or basically with what kind of concept—are you turning over the page of yesterday, while at the same time opening the page of today?

    在日历面前
    吕林
    今年的由科学普及出版社印制的日历，有一个为往年的日历所没有的特点，在每一页上，都印着一行：“今天是本年的第××天，本年还剩×××天”。在每一页上面，它的字体虽然远比那为日历所主要要表明的日期的字体小，但是，当你每天在翻出一页来的时候，它在你的面前却比那表明日期的字体更显眼——因为，它尖锐地触着你的对于生活的观念。
    对于生活的一种观念是：等到过完这一年的时候，宁神回想这一年的生活，每天吃的都比一般人好，着的都比一般人强，一切物质到精神的享受都比一般人多，因此，比起一般人来，就可以无憾。甚而至于一生，也是如此。基于这样一种观念，在自己还活着的时候，凡逢吃时，就尽量吃得好一些，凡逢着时，就尽量着得美一点；凡遇任何一点一滴物质和精神享受的机会，都尽可能地不放过。每当过了这样的一天，就觉得这一天对自己最有意义、毫未虚度。
    对于生活的另一种观念是：等到过完了一年将尽的时候，宁神回想这一年，比起一般人来，也可以无憾。一生也是如此。因为，虽然自己作为一个人是即将不再存在了，但是自己所做过的每一件事情总是做过的；只要它属于对人民有益，即使它是细微的、无形的，不为人所知，既然是做了的，在客观上必然起过它一定的于人民有益的作用，因而会留下它一定的于人民有益的影响。基于这样一种观念，在自己还活着的现在，凡遇需要自己做的工作，就尽量地多做；凡遇自己能做的事情，就尽量地做好。凡是过了一天，就会警觉：这意味着自己能够在人世工作的日子又少了一天；凡是一天之中事情不多，做得不好，就会深悔：这一天在自己来说是虚度了。
    那么，在日历面前，你是在——或者基本上是在——怎样一种观念下去翻过昨天的、同时是翻开今天的一页的呢？
