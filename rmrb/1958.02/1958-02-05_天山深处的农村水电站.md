Rural Hydropower Station Deep in the Tianshan Mountains

　　In Donggou Township, Urumqi County, Xinjiang, deep in the Tianshan Mountains, since the establishment of a hydropower station in May 1957, every household has installed electric lights, and every cooperative has installed loudspeakers. At night, the electric lights shine brightly, and joyful folk songs rise and fall, creating a lively atmosphere. This mountainous area, which was once quiet and desolate, has now become vibrant.

　　The Donggou Township Hydropower Station generates electricity using spring water from the Tianshan Mountains. The capacity of the generator is 24 kilowatts (soon to be replaced with a 40-kilowatt generator). The construction of this hydropower station relied on the strength of the masses from five agricultural cooperatives, with a total investment of more than 120,000 yuan. The state bore more than 70,000 yuan for the generators and wires. It now supplies electricity to local schools, health stations, canteens, supply and marketing cooperatives, and over 400 electric lights for lighting in agricultural cooperatives.

　　The construction of the hydropower station has illuminated a beautiful and glorious prospect for the electrification of mountainous rural areas. Within a year or two, Donggou Township will establish electric sawmills, flour processing plants, and oil pressing plants. Each agricultural cooperative has also made plans for using electricity for production. Yang Zhixin, the director of the Donghu Agricultural Cooperative, proudly said, "Our mountain village is gradually moving towards electrification!"

　　The completion of the Donggou Township Hydropower Station has not only brought prosperity to the mountain village but has also closely connected the hearts of the people in the mountainous area with those all over the country. Every evening after dinner, the cooperative members gather around the radio and loudspeakers, carefully listening to news of construction from all over the country, especially the voices from faraway Beijing. Some time ago, when they heard the heart-stirring National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the rebroadcast of Chairman Mao's speech in Moscow, they excitedly ran around telling each other, greatly boosting their confidence in building the mountainous area. Members of the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative said: The light of socialism illuminates the border mountainous area. We must turn the Gobi into an oasis, and the poor mountain valleys into granaries. There is great potential for the construction of mountainous areas!

　　天山深处的农村水电站
    在天山深处的新疆乌鲁木齐县的东沟乡，自1957年5月间建立了水电站后，家家安上了电灯，社社装上了喇叭。入夜，电灯齐明，欢乐的民族歌曲，此起彼伏，响成一片。这个一向沉寂荒凉的山区，现在却变得生气勃勃了。
    东沟乡水电站是利用天山上的泉水发电的，电机的容量二十四瓩（不久将换装四十瓩的发电机）。这个水电站的工程是依靠五个农业社的群众力量修建起来的，一共投资十二万多元，国家负担了七万多元的电机和电线费。现在供应当地学校、卫生站、食堂、供销社和农业社四百多盏电灯照明。
    水电站的兴建给山区农村的电气化照亮了美丽光辉的远景。在一两年内，东沟乡要建立电动锯木厂、面粉加工厂和榨油厂，各农业社也作出了用电生产的计划。东湖农业社今年将建立电动打麦机、孵卵机和电磨等，社主任杨志新自豪地说：“我们的山村渐渐走向电气化哩！”
    东沟乡水电站的建成，不但使山村繁荣，而且把山区人们的心和全国各地紧紧的连在一起了。每当晚饭后，社员们就聚集在收音机和喇叭筒的旁边，认真地收听全国各地建设的消息，特别是来自遥远的北京的声音。前些时，当他们听到中央人民广播电台播出的振撼人心的全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）和转播毛主席在莫斯科的讲话录音后，他们兴奋地到处奔走相告，大大地鼓舞了建设山区的信心。五星农业社的社员说：社会主义的光芒照亮了边疆的山区，咱们要让戈壁变绿洲，穷山沟变成米粮川，山区的建设大有可为哩！
