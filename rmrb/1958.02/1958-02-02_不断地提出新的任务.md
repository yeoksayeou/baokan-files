　　Constantly Propose New Tasks
　　Kong Sang
    The news published today that Shanghai has become a competition center for many cities to emulate and surpass each other in industrial products tells us two gratifying things: First, the quality of Shanghai's industrial products, especially light industrial products, which has always been praised as "the best in the country," is now being used as a competitive target by many cities, aiming to catch up with it in the short term, and some products have already caught up. This reflects the revolutionary drive and revolutionary ambition of China's working class! Second, Shanghai's workers are not satisfied with their current achievements and are striving to make further progress. This reflects how far-sighted, open-minded, tireless, and unremitting China's working class is!
    Comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced is a method to comprehensively promote the Great Leap Forward in production. In industrial production, the difference between advanced and backward always exists. Especially in the current situation where everyone is leaping forward, and in the situation of mutual competition, some factories, workshops, groups, and workers will always be ahead; some factories, workshops, groups, and workers will be temporarily behind. Being temporarily behind is, of course, not good. However, as long as you do not resign yourself to lagging behind, as long as you admit that you are backward, admit that others are advanced, and humbly and earnestly learn from others, turning their advanced things into your own, you can quickly catch up and surpass the units or individuals that were originally advanced. And other units or individuals will in turn learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced. In long-term competition, such a situation will emerge: sometimes I am running in front, sometimes you are leading, everyone is unwilling to lag behind, and everyone is drumming up enthusiasm to move forward. The overall level of industrial production in our country will rapidly improve in the continuous contradiction and unity of advanced and backward, and catch up with and surpass some economically developed countries in a not-too-long period.
    Chairman Mao said that modesty helps one to progress, while arrogance makes one lag behind. Units and individuals temporarily in an advanced position must not be arrogant. It must be understood that although others are behind you in major aspects, they may be more advanced than you in some aspects. If you become arrogant and complacent with a little advancement, you will not see the strengths of others. Even if others have already run ahead, you will still feel that "there is nothing advanced" and "it's just so-so." This will not only fail to make the "advanced even more advanced" but will also turn you into a backward element, far behind others. Here, it is very important for leaders to constantly propose new tasks and new goals based on the new situation. As soon as one task is completed, another task is proposed; as soon as an advanced goal is achieved, an even more advanced goal is proposed. People will not have time to be proud, can always maintain full enthusiasm, and can make the "advanced even more advanced." Shanghai's industrial leadership departments have adopted such leadership methods, and Shanghai Jiefang Daily has adopted such propaganda methods. They have pointed out some industrial products in Shanghai that have already been surpassed by others, and pointed out the specific shortcomings, reminding the advanced to be wary of complacency, and spurring the backward to catch up quickly. This approach of the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Department should be learned and promoted in any work and in all leadership departments.

### 不断地提出新的任务

　　不断地提出新的任务
　　孔桑
    今天发表的上海成为许多城市工业品比先进赶先进的竞赛中心的消息，告诉了我们两件可喜的事情：一是上海的工业产品，特别是轻工业产品的质量，一向被誉为“全国第一”的，现在居然有许多城市以它为竞赛对手，要在短期内赶上它，而且有些产品已经赶上了它。这反映了我国工人阶级的革命干劲、革命雄心是何等的昂扬！二是上海的职工不满足于现在的成就，争取百尺竿头再进一步。这反映了我国工人阶级又是多么的目光远大，虚怀若谷，不知休止，不知懈怠！
    比先进、学先进、赶先进，是全面促进生产大跃进的方法。在工业生产中，先进和落后的差别是经常存在着的，特别在目前大家都向前跃进的形势下，在互相竞赛的形势下，总会有些工厂、车间、小组和工人走在前面；有些工厂、车间、小组和工人暂时走在后面。暂时走在后面，当然不好。但是，只要不自甘落后，只要承认自己落后，承认别人先进，虚心地认真地向别人学习，把别人先进的东西变为自己的东西，就可以很快地赶上去，超过原来是先进的单位或个人。而别的单位或个人又会回过头来学先进、赶先进，在长期竞赛中，就会出现这样的局面：有时候我跑在前面，有时候你领先，大家都不甘落后，大家都鼓起干劲往前赶。我们国家的整个工业生产水平，就会在先进与落后的不断矛盾和统一中迅速提高，在不太长的时期内赶上和超过一些经济发达的国家。
    毛主席说，虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。暂时处于先进地位的单位和个人，千万不能骄傲。要知道，别人在主要方面虽然比你落后，但是在某些方面也可能比你先进。如果有点先进之处就骄傲自满起来，就会看不到人家的长处，甚至人家已经跑到前面去了，还觉得“没啥先进”，“不过如此”。这就不仅不能使“先进的更加先进”，而且会变成落后分子，远远地落在别人后面。在这里，领导者经常根据新的形势，不断地提出新的任务，新的奋斗目标，就非常重要。刚刚完成一个任务接着又提出一个任务，刚刚达到一个先进的目标，接着又提出一个更先进的目标，人们就来不及骄傲，就能经常保持饱满的干劲，就能使“先进的更加先进”。上海的工业领导部门采取了这样的领导方法，上海解放日报采取了这样的宣传方法，他们把上海的一些已经被别人赶过的工业品提出来，并且指出具体的落后之处，提醒先进的警惕自满，鞭策落后的赶快赶上去。上海市工业部门的这种作法，在任何一项工作中，在一切领导部门都应该学习推广。
