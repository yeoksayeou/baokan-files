    The Fifth Session of the National People's Congress, which spurred the great leap forward of the people across the country, has just concluded victoriously. As we happily welcome the arrival of the 1958 Spring Festival, I am pleased to compose a short poem as a tribute, to express our shared joy and encouragement.
    The meeting concludes with heroes,
    The whole people leap forward,
    Will soars.
    Give play to initiative,
    Grandly open the path to aid the times.
    The high tide of construction surges,
    Creating miracles, boundless and brilliant;
    What is it like?
    Clouds rising and glowing,
    Ten thousand zhang of radiance.
    The season turns to three yang,
    Exploding firecrackers, red flags fluttering everywhere;
    Singing praises across the four seas,
    Joy spreading everywhere.
    Who brings about this prosperous scene?
    The wise leadership of the Party Central Committee!
    Let us all be encouraged,
    The East Wind exerts force,
    Vast spring scenery.
              February 15th

    东风齐着力
    李济深
    带动全国人民大跃进的人大第五次会议甫届胜利闭幕，欣值1958年春节来临，喜谱小词为颂，借以同申欢欣鼓舞之忱云尔。
    会竣群英，
    全民跃进，
    意志飞扬。
    发挥积极，
    宏启济时方。
    建设高潮滚滚，
    创奇迹、无限辉煌；
    知何似？
    云蒸霞蔚，
    万丈光芒。
    节序转三阳，
    喧爆竹、红旗到处飘扬；
    讴歌四海，
    喜气共洋洋。
    谁致升平景象？
    英明领导党中央！
    齐鼓舞
    东风着力，
    浩荡春光。
