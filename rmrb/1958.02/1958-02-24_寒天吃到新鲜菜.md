    Being able to eat fresh vegetables in cold weather is mainly due to vegetable cellars. Vegetable cellars are generally large pits dug in the ground, with a shed frame built on top, covered with soil, and with two or three ventilation holes. The temperature inside the cellar is mostly around 6 to 10 degrees Celsius, and the humidity is around 70% to 85% (the humidity standard is based on the maximum amount of water vapor that can fill the air being 100%, and if it only equals half of the maximum water vapor content, it is called 50%, and so on). Green vegetables stored under such humidity and temperature can stay fresh for a long time. This is because if the green vegetables are placed directly in the air, they will freeze if it is cold; they will become moldy and rot due to heat or the action of bacteria, and they will wither due to moisture evaporation. However, under the temperature and humidity conditions in the cellar, a large amount of moisture evaporation can be avoided, and it is not suitable for the growth and reproduction of bacteria, so the vegetables will not wither or rot. In addition, there are air vents in the cellar to prevent dirty air from stagnating, so the green vegetables can be kept fresh in the cellar for a relatively long time. (Book)

    寒天吃到新鲜菜
    寒冷的日子里能吃到新鲜菜，主要是靠菜窖。菜窖一般都是在地下挖一个大坑，在上面支上棚架，再盖上泥土并留两、三个通气孔。菜窖内的温度多在摄氏六度到十度左右，湿度在70％到85％左右（湿度标准是以空气中充满最多量的水汽时作为一百，若只相当于水汽最高含量的一半时称为50％，余类推），在上述这样的湿度和温度下储存的青菜，就可保持长期新鲜。因为如果把青菜直接放在空气中，遇冷就冻坏；遇热或受细菌作用就霉烂和水分蒸发而枯萎。但在菜窖中的温度和湿度的条件下，既可避免水分大量蒸发，又不适于细菌生长繁殖，所以菜就不致枯萎、霉烂。再加上窖内有通空气的气孔，使污秽的空气不能停留，所以可使青菜在窖内能较长期地保持新鲜。（书）
