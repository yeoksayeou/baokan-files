Stubbornness is a significant flaw in behavior. People with this flaw often insist on their own way and act unreasonably to satisfy their desires. For example, six-year-old Grisha walked to the table, wanting to take the alarm clock to play with. His father didn't allow it. "I want it!" Grisha said. "I want the clock!"

His father and mother explained to him that the clock shouldn't be played with, because it's not a toy, and playing with it might break or damage it. But Grisha didn't want to listen and insisted on shouting:

"Give me the clock!"

After the father left, the mother, to avoid Grisha's fuss, gave him the clock. But Grisha didn't play with the clock; he just held it tightly and proudly. His whole demeanor showed that what was important to him was not the clock itself, but achieving his goal.

This is a manifestation of stubbornness.

Nervous children are often stubborn. Due to neurasthenia, such children are easily in an abnormal state under intense stimulation. Such children should be taken to a doctor and given a reasonable daily routine. Parents must treat them with a gentle and calm attitude, and must not treat them with any aggressive or mocking attitude.

Children become stubborn often because parents undermine their initiative, disrespect their personalities, and so on. Let's look at an example:

"Dad, I've finished all my homework," the son said. "Can I go play with my classmates?"

"You're not allowed to go anywhere," the father said rudely.

"Why?"

"Just not allowed!" the father said decisively.

Such an unreasonable refusal and rude manner would naturally make the child angry.

"I insist on going!" the son said angrily and resolutely.

At this time, the child's desire to play has become secondary; his main goal is to stubbornly insist on his own way. It was the father himself who prompted his son to be stubborn.

Some stubbornness is caused by parents excessively spoiling their children. Children who are spoiled become the center of attention in the family, and even if their wishes are unreasonable, the whole family tries to satisfy them. In this case, it is easy for children to become willful and stubborn.

Sometimes, children become stubborn as a result of parents not disciplining them. For example, a twelve-year-old boy named Kolya, whose parents rarely cared about him. He could do whatever he wanted, preparing his homework "when he felt like it," playing when he wanted to, and doing whatever he pleased. When his parents began to make demands on him, he immediately resisted stubbornly. This is not surprising, because Kolya was used to only obeying his own desires.

In order to prevent and overcome children's stubbornness, parents and all adults in the family should first learn to properly treat children's initiative. When a child's initiative is suppressed, or conversely, is in a state of no control, then it will inevitably lead to the child forming many bad qualities, including stubbornness.

When a child has stubborn emotions, how do you eliminate them?

If a child becomes stubborn because of something, the best way at this time is to ignore him, and don't try to persuade him, especially don't use coercive means to subdue him. Before the child calms down, it is best not to use any educational methods. When the child discovers that no one is paying attention to him, he will soon calm down, and then it will be easy to persuade him.

Sometimes, simply diverting the child's attention can eliminate stubbornness. For example, with young children, talk to them about something else; with older children, you can lead them to do something else.

There are also children who are unwilling to obey direct requests made to them, but easily obey requests made to everyone in general. For example, Zirochka never ate well at lunchtime. The mother said:

"After we finish eating, we'll all go play. If anyone doesn't eat, they'll have to stay at home."

After this general warning was issued, Zirochka immediately started eating.

Using deadlines for stubborn children often yields good results. Don't let the stubborn child carry out the request immediately, but execute it after a while.

A mother said to her daughter:

"Natasha, it's time to go to bed. In five minutes, you have to finish your homework."

The "deadline" can give the child emotional preparation time to overcome his initial habitual resistance. This is an applicable method for stubborn children.

When educating stubborn children, you must be good at making concessions on minor issues and cannot force him to obey in everything. In some unimportant areas, if the child stubbornly insists on his own way, then you can make concessions to him, and then require him to unconditionally complete the main things.

### 谈谈孩子的固执

　　谈谈孩子的固执
    固执，是行为中的重大缺点。有这种缺点的人，常常要固执己见，蛮不讲理地来满足自己的愿望。例如，六岁的格里沙走到桌旁，想把闹钟拿来玩。父亲不许。“我要嘛！”格里沙说。“我要钟！”
    父亲和母亲给他解释，钟是不能够拿着玩的，因为它不是玩具，拿着玩可能把它碰坏或是打破。但格里沙不愿听，并且坚持地喊着：
    “把钟给我呀！”
    当父亲走了以后，母亲为了免得格里沙吵闹，就把钟给了他。但格里沙并没有玩钟，他只是紧紧地、很得意地抱着钟，他的整个神气表现出：对他说来重要的不是钟，而是达到了自己的目的。
    这就是固执的表现。
    神经质的孩子多半是固执的。由于神经衰弱，这样的孩子们很容易在剧烈刺激下处于反常状态。应该让这样的孩子去就医，并且给他安排合理的生活制度。家长们对他们的态度必须是温和的、平静的，千万不能用任何激烈的，嘲笑的态度去对待他们。
    孩子变得固执起来，往往是由于家长们损害了他们的主动性，不尊重他们的人格，等等。我们来看一个例子：
    “爸爸，我的功课全准备好了，”儿子说。“我和同学们去玩一下好吗？”
    “你哪儿也不许去，”父亲粗暴地说。
    “为什么呢？”
    “就是不准去！”父亲断然地说。
    这种无理的拒绝和粗暴的方式，自然会使孩子生气。
    “我偏要去！”儿子也很生气地、坚决地说。
    这时，孩子想要游戏的目的已经居于次要的地位了，他主要的是固执己见。这是父亲自己促使儿子固执的。
    还有一些固执现象，是由于家长们过份地溺爱孩子而引起的。孩子受到溺爱，成为全家注意的中心，即使他的愿望是不合理的，全家人也都去满足他。在这种情况下，很容易使孩子变得任性和固执。
    有时候，孩子变得固执是由于家长们对他不加管教的结果。例如，有个十二岁的孩子柯里亚，家长们很少管他的事。他一切都可以自由自便，准备功课“凭高兴”，想玩就玩，想干什么就干什么。当家长们开始对他提出某种要求时，立刻遭到他固执的反抗。这并不奇怪，因为柯里亚习惯于只服从自己的愿望。
    为了防止和克服孩子的固执，家长们及家庭中所有的成年人，首先应当学会适当地对待孩子的主动性。当孩子的
  主动性受到压抑，或是相反地处于没有任何管束的状态时，那么就不可避免地会导致孩子形成许多不好的品质，其中也包括固执。
    当孩子有了固执情绪时，怎么来消除它呢？
    如果孩子因某件事而固执起来，这时最好的办法是对他不加理睬，也不要去劝他，尤其不要以强迫手段来压服他。在孩子安定下来以前，最好任何教育手段都不要采用。当孩子发现没有人理会他的时候，他很快就会安静下来，这时就很容易说服他了。
    有时候，只要转移孩子的注意力，就可以消除固执。例如对年幼的孩子，同他说些别的事；对年龄较大的孩子，可以引他去作旁的事情。
    也有这样的孩子，他不愿服从于直接对他提出的要求，而很容易服从以一般形式对大家提出的要求。例如济洛奇卡在午饭时总不好好吃饭。母亲就说：
    “吃完饭我们大家去玩。要是有谁不吃饭，就让他留在家里。”
    这种一般地提出警告后，济洛奇卡马上就吃饭了。
    对固执的孩子采用限期的办法，也常常收到好的效果。不要让固执的孩子马上执行要求，而是过一会儿再执行。
    一位母亲对女儿说：
    “娜塔沙，该睡觉了。再过五分钟，你就得结束功课”。
    “限期”，可以使孩子在感情上有一个准备时间，以克制他最初的习惯上的抗拒性。这对固执的孩子是一种适用的方式。
    在教育固执的孩子时，必须善于对次要问题采取让步的态度，不能在一切问题上都强制他听话。在某些无关紧要的地方，如果孩子固执己见，那么可以对他让步，然后要求他无条件地完成主要的事。
