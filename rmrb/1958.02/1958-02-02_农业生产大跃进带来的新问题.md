　　New Problems Brought About by the Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production
　　Zhang Zongyin
    The Huzhu Agricultural Production Cooperative of Shajingzi Village, Huanghua County, on the coast of Bohai, achieved a high yield of an average of 1,023 jin per mu on 9,000 mu of land in 1957 (see the report written by Zhang Zongyin on page 2 of this newspaper on January 29th for details). The members of this cooperative are putting themselves into a new production upsurge more actively and energetically.
    The reality of the cooperative predicts to us that the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production brings some new problems. It is hoped that comrades on the industrial front, agricultural front, commercial front, science and technology front, and cultural and educational front across the country will study and solve these new problems.
    It is necessary to find ways to expand reproduction for abundant funds.
    The Huzhu Cooperative was established in the spring of 1956. In 1956, it harvested 400,000,540 jin of rice and 4,050,000 jin of rice straw, with a total value of 522,106 yuan. It retained 86,000 yuan for public accumulation and 16,950 yuan for production costs, and distributed 419,156 yuan to the members. In 1957, it harvested more than 9 million jin of rice, 10.34 million jin of rice straw, 1 million jin of reeds, and caught 190,000 jin of fish, with a total value of 1,230,360 yuan. It retained 345,180 yuan for public accumulation and 270,000 yuan for production costs (the above two items accounted for 50% of the total income), and distributed 615,180 yuan to the members. In 1956 and 1957, a total of 431,180 yuan was deducted for public accumulation. The cooperative currently has 14 diesel engines (a total of 88 horsepower), one pot camel machine (75 horsepower), 32 dragon bone waterwheels, 38 rice threshers (thorn pullers), one electric mill, one machine mill, eight rubber-wheeled carts, 68 mules and horses, 47 boats, 160 Lingpans (ice sleds, transportation tools), one large frozen net, 2,000 fish weirs, 26 rooms for warehouses and offices, and four water culverts; as well as some medium- and small-sized agricultural tools and furniture owned by the cooperative. The above fixed assets occupy a total of 243,980 yuan of funds. According to production needs, it is planned to build four Yangchao sluices and one water culvert on the large dike; it is planned to purchase two diesel engines (a total of 24 horsepower), 30 mules and horses, four rubber-wheeled carts, 2,000 pigs, and one large frozen net. The above items will occupy a total of 100,720 yuan of funds. Among the public accumulation that has already been deducted, after deducting the occupation of fixed assets and the occupation of production equipment to be added, there is still a cash balance of 80,000 yuan. In addition, the members can be mobilized to invest 200,000 yuan in the cooperative. The funds used for production are all used up according to the existing plan. The bank loan of 180,000 yuan has been paid off. There are still 280,000 yuan in cash for which no way can be found to expand reproduction. It is estimated that the total production income for the whole year of 1958 will be 1,664,300 yuan. According to 25% deduction for public accumulation, a total of 416,075 yuan can be deducted. The production equipment that can be used for many years was all purchased in 1957, and the investment needed in capital construction in 1958 is even less, but more than 400,000 yuan of public accumulation can be deducted again. How to use these funds to expand reproduction? This question is becoming more and more prominent.
    In 1956 and 1957, the Huzhu Cooperative bought 17 machines and prepared to buy two more; in 1957 alone, it bought 600,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, 600,000 jin of coal, 40,000 jin of diesel oil, and cement for repairing sluices and water culverts. Light industrial products such as hemp rope, cotton yarn, cloth, woolen clothes, shoes, socks, thermos bottles, flashlights, alkali noodles, cooking oil, paper, etc., are also a large sum. With the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the purchasing power of the vast collective farmers across the country will inevitably increase greatly. The market should meet the above needs as much as possible to ensure the balanced development of industry and agriculture.
    It is necessary to study and improve agricultural machinery and other means of production, and to ensure that they are both applicable and economical.
    The Huzhu Cooperative now has sufficient economic conditions to purchase the medium- and small-sized agricultural machinery and means of production it needs. The members urgently hope and demand to replace the heavy manual labor with agricultural machinery, and they urgently hope to improve working conditions as much as possible. However, some of the current machines are not very suitable and must be improved. Last year, the cooperative used tractors to plow the land, plowing 5.5 inches deep, and paid 1 yuan per mu for machine plowing. When machine plowing, it is necessary to manually fill in the capillary ditches and dig them out after plowing. For a piece of machine-plowed land, it is necessary to use 14 more man-days to level the ditches, dig the ditches, and dig the unplowed land that the machine cannot plow. If it is not machine-plowed, it can be dug 8 inches deep with an iron shovel, and only 13 man-days are used for a piece of land. Machine plowing costs one more man-day and 6 yuan and 71 cents more for machine plowing per piece of land, and the plowing is shallower. Machine plowing of paddy fields, according to the current situation, is neither suitable nor economical. Combine harvesting is fast and good, which is very popular among the members. When harrowing seedlings, it is necessary to work in the mud and water all day long, which is very hard. The members hope to produce a suitable and economical colloidal glove like the one used in surgical operations. It is hoped that the relevant scientific and technical personnel and comrades on the industrial production front will study and solve these problems.
    The material and cultural living standards of farmers should be improved along with the improvement of production levels; what should be done if there is still money left after raising them to a certain limit?
    The production level of agricultural cooperatives has been improved, and the improvement is very large. If the living standard still remains at the original level, it will more or less affect the enthusiasm of the members. If the living standard of the members is appropriately improved, it will promote the continued improvement of the production level, which is good for the country, the cooperative, and the members. In 1956, the Huzhu Cooperative distributed a total of 419,156 yuan of labor remuneration to the members, and the consumption of 1,034 members for meals, etc. in the current year was 150,000 yuan. Building 700 houses cost 49,000 yuan, and purchasing clothing, bedding, and other items that can be used for several years cost 62,156 yuan. A total of 8,000 yuan of public bonds were purchased, and 150,000 yuan was sent back to their hometowns by the newly migrated members. In 1957, a total of 615,180 yuan of labor remuneration was distributed to the members (accounting for 50% of the total income of the current year). The members' food consumption was 200,600 yuan, and it is planned to build another 400 new houses at a cost of 40,000 yuan. It is planned to buy 20,000 yuan of public bonds. The members' single, lined, leather, and cotton clothes, bedding, raincoats, rain boots, thermos bottles, flashlights, etc., were basically purchased in full last year. This year, it is planned to spend 23,600 yuan on adding clothes and pocket money. After deducting the above expenses, there is still a surplus of 330,980 yuan. It is planned to mobilize the members to invest 200,000 yuan in the cooperative, and the remaining 130,980 yuan (an average of about 150 yuan per household) is still in the hands of the members. In line with the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, running the cooperative with diligence and thrift, and managing the family with diligence and thrift, how should this surplus money be spent?
    Agricultural cooperatives urgently need talented people with culture and technology to join their ranks and help them.
    In order to fully and rationally utilize their funds and labor resources, agricultural cooperatives must implement an economic accounting system, which requires many talented accounting and statistical personnel. Talented people with crop cultivation technology and mechanical repair and use technology can play a more important role in agricultural cooperatives. People with experience in managing collective economic undertakings are also very useful to agricultural cooperatives. Cultural and educational workers are not without "use" when they arrive at agricultural cooperatives. Rural areas are undergoing a great transformation process. Contemporary rural life has very rich epic materials; the members also want to enliven cultural and entertainment activities very much. Therefore, people with literary and artistic talents are also very welcome in agricultural cooperatives. Yuan Yutian, deputy director of the Huzhu Cooperative, said: "...Our cooperative lacks talents in these areas too much. All the members welcome them to come, the more the better." Comrades who are willing to contribute to socialist agricultural construction, the collective farmers are waiting for you with excitement and expectation!

　　农业生产大跃进带来的新问题
　　张宗荫
    渤海之滨的黄骅县沙井子村互助农业生产合作社，1957年在九千亩土地上获得了平均亩产一千零二十三斤的高额丰产成绩（详见1月29日本报第二版所载张宗荫写的通讯）。这个社的社员们，正在更积极更有劲地投入新的生产高潮。
    互助社的现实情况预示给我们：农业生产的大跃进带来一些新的问题。希望全国工业战线上、农业战线上、商业战线上、科学技术战线上、文化教育战线上的同志们，都来研究和解决这些新问题。
    要给雄厚的资金找到扩大再生产的门径。
    互助社1956年春季建社，1956年收获稻谷四十万零五千四百五十斤、稻草四百零五万斤，共折价五十二万二千一百零六元，扣留公共积累八万六千元，生产费一万六千九百五十元，分给社员四十一万九千一百五十六元。1957年收获稻谷九百多万斤，稻草一千零三十四万斤，苇子一百万斤，捕鱼十九万斤，共计折价一百二十三万零三百六十元，扣留公共积累三十四万五千一百八十元，生产费二十七万元（以上两项扣留占总收入50％），分给社员六十一万五千一百八十元。1956年和1957年两年共扣除公共积累四十三万一千一百八十元。社现有十四台柴油机（共八十八马力）、一部锅驼机（七十五马力）、三十二个龙骨水车，三十八个打稻机（刺落子）、一个电磨、一个机碾，八辆胶轮大车、六十八匹骡马、四十七只船、一百六十个凌盘（冰床子，运输工具），一张大冻网、二千块鱼箔，仓库及办公室所用房屋二十六间，过水涵洞四个；以及属于社公有的一些中、小型农具、家具等。以上各项固定财产共计占用资金二十四万三千九百八十元。根据生产需要，准备修建阳潮闸四个，大围堤上的过水涵洞一个；准备购买柴油机两台（共二十四马力）骡马三十匹，胶轮大车四辆，猪二千头，大冻网一张。以上各项共计再占用资金十万零七千二百元。在已经扣留的公共积累中，除去固定财产占用以及准备添置的生产设备占用，尚余现金八万元。此外还能发动社员向社投资二十万元。用于生产的资金，按现有计划都用足了。银行贷款十八万元都还清了。还有二十八万元的现金找不出扩大再生产的门径。预计1958年全年生产的总收入是一百六十六万四千三百元，按25％扣留公共积累，共能扣留四十一万六千零七十五元。凡是可以多年使用的生产设备，1957年都置办齐全了，1958年在基本建设方面需要的投资就更少了，但是又可以扣留出四十多万元的公共积累。怎样运用这些资金扩大再生产呢？这个问题越来越显得突出了。
    互助社1956年和1957年买了十七台机器，准备再买两台；1957年一年就买了六十万斤化肥，六十万斤煤，四万斤柴油，以及修闸和过水涵洞用的水泥等等。轻工业品如麻绳、棉纱、布匹、绒衣、鞋袜、暖壶、手电筒、碱面、食油、纸张等等，也是一笔很大的数字。随着农业生产的大跃进，全国广大集体农民的购买力必然会大大地提高。市场上应该尽可能满足上述需要，以保证工农业平衡发展。
    要研究和改进农业机器及其他生产资料，要保证既适用、又经济。
    互助社现在已经有充分的经济条件购买他们所需要的中、小型农业机器和生产资料，社员们迫切地希望和要求用农业机器代替人力的繁重劳动，他们迫切地希望尽可能改善劳动条件。但是，现在的机器有些不大适用，必须改进。互助社去年用拖拉机耕地，耕五点五寸深，耕一亩交机耕费一元。机耕的时候必须用人工把毛渠填平，耕后再挖出来。一丘机耕地，平渠、挖渠、掘机器耕不到的漏耕地，必须再用去十四个人工。如果不机耕，用人工用铁锨掘，能掘八寸深，一丘地只用十三个人工。机耕比人掘一丘地反而多费一个人工，多花机耕费六元七角一分，还耕的浅。机耕水田，按目前情况核算，既不适用，又不经济。康拜因脱粒又快又好，则是社员们非常欢迎的。挠秧的时候必须用手整天在泥水里工作，很吃苦，社员们希望给他们生产出一种既适用、又经济的像动外科手术用的胶质手套。这些问题，希望有关的科学技术人员和工业生产战线上的同志们研究和解决。
    农民的物质生活与文化生活的水平，应随着生产水平的提高而有所提高；提高到一定限度仍有余钱该怎么办？
    农业社的生产水平提高了，而且提高的很多，如果生活水平仍然停留在原来的水平上，就会或多或少地影响社员们的劳动积极性。如果适当地提高社员们的生活水平，就能促使生产水平继续不断地提高，这对国家、对社、对社员都有好处。互助社在1956年共分给社员的劳动报酬是四十一万九千一百五十六元，一千零三十四个社员吃饭等等当年的消费十五万元。盖房七百间用去四万九千元，购置衣服、被褥等能用几年的物品用去六万二千一百五十六元，共买公债八千元，新迁移来的社员寄回老家去十五万元。1957年共分给社员的劳动报酬是六十一万五千一百八十元（占当年总收入的50％）。社员吃饭消费二十万零六百元，准备再盖新房四百间用去四万元，准备买公债二万元。社员们单、夹、皮、棉衣服，被褥、雨衣、雨鞋、暖壶、手电筒等等，去年基本上置买齐全了。今年添置衣服和零用钱准备用去二万三千六百元。除去以上各项开支，还能节余三十三万零九百八十元。准备发动社员向社投资二十万元，其余留在社员手里的尚有十三万零九百八十元（每户平均一百五十元左右）。本着勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家的方针，这些余钱应该怎样花用呢？
    农业社迫切需要有文化有技术的人才，来参加他们的队伍，帮助他们。
    农业社为了充分地、合理地利用自己的资金和劳动资源，必须实行经济核算制度，这就需要很多有才能的会计、统计人员。有农作物栽培技术和机械修理使用技术的人才，在农业社更能发挥重要的作用。管理集体经济事业有经验的人，对于农业社也非常有用。文化教育工作者到了农业社，也不是没有“用武之地”。农村正在经历着一个伟大的变革过程。当代的农村生活，有非常丰富的史诗的材料；社员们也非常想把文化娱乐活动活跃起来。因此，具有文学、艺术才能的人，也是农业社非常欢迎的人。互助社副主任元玉田同志说：“……俺们社太缺少这些方面的人才，全体社员都欢迎他们来，来的越多越好。”愿意为社会主义农业建设贡献力量的同志们，集体农民们怀着兴奋和盼望的心情，在等待着你们！
