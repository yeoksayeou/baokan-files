Dulles' Futile Trip
Commentator of this newspaper

    The Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council has ended hastily on January 30th. This meeting was held under the situation where the Soviet Union's peace initiatives were having a great impact one after another, and the idea of peaceful coexistence was becoming more and more popular. But whenever the people strive to ease the international situation, the US ruling group tries to intensify the tension, vainly trying to obstruct the torrent of peace. The Ankara meeting was convened for this purpose of the US ruling group, it is a continuation of the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group, and it is a countercurrent in the international situation.
    Although the United States is not a formal member of the Baghdad Pact group, US Secretary of State Dulles traveled a long way to attend the meeting. On the eve of the meeting, Dulles vigorously campaigned for the meeting. On the first day of the meeting, this US "observer" unceremoniously issued orders to the Middle Eastern countries participating in the Baghdad Pact, asking them to tighten their belts and make "sacrifices" in order to implement the US's war and aggression policy. Throughout the meeting, Dulles appeared as the host. No wonder even Reuters believes that the United States is actually "in a full member status."
    Dulles went to Ankara this time with the purpose of cheering up the members of the Baghdad Pact and deploying war preparation plans in the Middle East. The US ruling group is bent on threatening the peace and security of the Middle East. The Ankara meeting decided to establish the so-called "Joint Military Planning Staff" of the Baghdad Pact group, and the vice chairman of this organization is to be a US general, obviously to facilitate the United States to strengthen its military control over the Baghdad Pact countries. Dulles also said that once a war breaks out, the United States will send "mobile forces" to the Middle East, and the Middle Eastern members of the Baghdad Pact group will provide the United States with cannon fodder and bases. In addition, according to reports from Indian news agencies, on the eve of the Ankara meeting, the "Anti-Subversion Committee" of the Baghdad Pact organization held a meeting and issued a communique, openly stating that this so-called "Anti-Subversion Committee" will "greatly expand" its activities in the future and intensify its interference in the independence and sovereignty of Arab countries. All this shows that Dulles is trying to tie the Baghdad Pact member states tightly to the US war chariot through the Ankara meeting, forcing them to continue to expand their armaments, and pushing them onto the dangerous road of being involved in an atomic war.
    However, the results of the Ankara meeting show that Dulles' main plans have failed. The main purpose of the United States sending Dulles to attend the Ankara meeting in person was to turn the countries of the Baghdad Group into US missile bases after the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. According to various sources, Dulles raised this issue at the Ankara meeting, but it did not receive the support of some Muslim countries amid strong protests from the people of the Middle East. Although on the eve of the meeting, the United States had instructed Turkish Prime Minister Menderes to carry out activities in Baghdad, Iraq was unwilling to embark on this dangerous road. Iraqi Prime Minister Mirjan declared that Iraq did not undertake any obligations under the Baghdad Pact to allow the establishment of nuclear weapons or rocket weapons bases in Iraq. As a result, the communique of the meeting had to silently avoid this issue. Secondly, Dulles originally planned to link the Baghdad Group with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization through the Ankara meeting, so as to make the Baghdad Group a vassal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the main aggressive group of the United States, and thereby strengthen its control over the Baghdad Pact member states. As a result, this expectation did not come true. The Ankara meeting only further proved that the contradictions between the United States and the Baghdad Pact countries and between the countries formally participating in this aggressive group are further developing. Dulles wanted to mend these rifts and boost the "morale" of this group, but the result was just the opposite. Not only were the old rifts not repaired, but they were further widened.
    The main dispute at the Ankara meeting reflected the conflict of interests between the Muslim countries of the Baghdad Group and the United States and Britain. Dulles demanded that the Muslim countries of the Baghdad Pact further serve the US war plan, while these countries were interested in economic issues. These countries have been following the United States in expanding their armaments and preparing for war for several years, which has led to national poverty and hardship, and they are eager to get more dollars and pounds to ease their difficult situation. However, Dulles tried his best to avoid this request. Under the pressure of the Muslim countries, he reluctantly expressed his willingness to provide another $10 million in "assistance," but this money was stipulated to be used for the construction of a telecommunications network, which was not at all helpful in helping these countries get rid of their economic difficulties. This cruel fact is worth pondering by those Middle Eastern countries participating in the Baghdad Pact: What benefits will they get by following the United States in expanding their armaments and preparing for war and selling their national sovereignty and destiny to the United States?
    In order to cover up the US's aggressive activities, Dulles wantonly slandered the Soviet Union at the Ankara meeting, especially attacking the Soviet Union's unconditional assistance to the Middle Eastern countries. This is of course in vain. The people of the Middle East know who their true friends are from their own experience. On January 29, the day before the close of the Ankara meeting, the Soviet Union and Egypt signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement in the spirit of true friendship and cooperation. As Saidqi, head of the Egyptian government's economic delegation, said: Not only Egyptians, but all Arabs are convinced that the Soviet Union's friendly assistance is a sincere wish from the bottom of their hearts.
    Today, in the Middle East, as in the rest of the world, peace has become the general trend. The people of the Middle Eastern countries warmly support the Soviet Union's two major peace initiatives on the non-use of force by major powers in the Middle East and the establishment of a nuclear weapon-free and rocket weapon-free zone in the Middle East, and strongly condemn the US's conspiracy to turn the Middle East into a hotbed of atomic war. Therefore, the Baghdad Pact, which serves the US's arms expansion, war preparations, and colonial aggression, like the Eisenhower Doctrine, has become the "target of public criticism" by peace-loving people in the Middle East. Egyptian President Nasser said: The main purpose of the Baghdad Pact is primarily to serve the interests of the major powers, not the interests of the smaller member states. The Egyptian government also issued a statement firmly condemning the practice of establishing missile bases in Middle Eastern countries. Syrian Minister of State Aqil also pointed out in his comments on the Ankara meeting that the Baghdad Pact is purely an imperialist treaty. The people of the Middle East are fighting to safeguard national independence and strive to turn the Middle East into a peaceful region. The conspiracy of the Ankara meeting is doomed to failure, and Dulles' efforts are nothing but a futile trip.

　　杜勒斯往返徒劳
　　本报评论员
    巴格达条约理事会安卡拉会议已经在1月30日草草收场了。这个会议是正当苏联的和平倡议一个接着一个地发生着巨大的影响，和平共处思想已经越来越深入人心的形势下举行的。但是每当人民努力使国际局势得到了一些缓和，美国统治集团就要设法加剧紧张局势，妄想阻挠和平的巨流。安卡拉会议就是为美国统治集团的这一目的而召开的，它是北大西洋集团巴黎会议的继续，是国际局势中的一股逆流。
    美国虽然并不是巴格达条约集团的正式成员国，但是美国国务卿杜勒斯却远道赶来参加这次会议。在会议前夕，杜勒斯就为这次会议而大肆活动。在会议的第一天，这位美国“观察员”竟毫不客气地向与会者发出号令，要参加巴格达条约的中近东国家为执行美国的战争和侵略政策而勒紧裤带，作出“牺牲”。在整个会议期间，杜勒斯都以主人的身份出现。无怪乎连路透社也认为美国实际上“已经处于一种完全成员国地位”了。
    杜勒斯这次是带着给巴格达条约成员国打气和在中近东部署备战计划的目的到安卡拉去的。美国统治集团一心要威胁中近东的和平与安全。安卡拉会议决定成立所谓巴格达条约集团“联合军事计划参谋部”，并且由美国的将军担任这个机构的副主席，显然是为了便于美国加强对巴格达条约国家的军事控制。杜勒斯并且说，一旦战争爆发，美国在中近东将出动“机动力量”，而巴格达条约集团的中近东成员国则要为美国提供炮灰和基地。此外，据印度的通讯社报道，在安卡拉会议前夕，巴格达条约组织的“反颠复委员会”举行会议并发表公报，公开表示这个所谓“反颠复委员会”今后要“大力扩大”它的活动，加紧干涉阿拉伯国家的独立和主权。这一切都表明杜勒斯力图通过安卡拉会议把巴格达条约成员国紧紧地缚在美国的战车上，迫使它们继续扩充军备，把它们推上卷入一场原子战争的危险的道路。
    但是，安卡拉会议的结果表明，杜勒斯的主要打算都落空了。美国派遣杜勒斯亲自出席安卡拉会议的主要目的，是企图在北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议以后，再把巴格达集团的国家变成美国的导弹基地。据各方消息透露，杜勒斯曾经在安卡拉会议上提出这个问题，可是在中近东各国人民的强烈抗议声中，它并没有得到某些穆斯林国家的支持。虽然在会议前夕，美国曾经指使土耳其首相曼德列斯到巴格达进行活动，伊拉克却不愿走上这条危险的道路。伊拉克首相米尔詹声明说：伊拉克并没有根据巴格达条约承担任何义务来允许在伊拉克建立核武器或者火箭武器基地。结果，会议的公报不得不默默地避开了这个问题。其次，杜勒斯本来还打算通过安卡拉会议，把巴格达集团同北大西洋公约组织联结起来，以便使巴格达集团成为美国主要侵略集团北大西洋公约组织的附庸，并借此加强对巴格达条约成员国的控制。结果，这个指望也没有如意。安卡拉会议只是更加证明了美国同巴格达条约国家之间以及正式参加这个侵略集团的国家之间的矛盾正在进一步发展。杜勒斯想弥补这些裂痕，提高这个集团的“士气”，结果恰恰相反，旧的裂痕不仅没有得到弥补，而且更加扩大了。
    安卡拉会议的主要争论反映了巴格达集团的穆斯林国家同美英之间的利害冲突。杜勒斯要求巴格达条约的穆斯林国家进一步为美国战争计划服务，而这些国家有兴趣的却是经济问题。这些国家几年来追随美国扩军备战，已经弄得国穷民困，灾难深重，它们渴望多弄到一些美元和英镑来缓和一下自己的艰难处境。但是，杜勒斯极力规避这种要求。他在穆斯林国家的压力下，勉强地表示再“援助”一千万美元，而这笔钱却又规定是用来建设电讯网的根本谈不上援助这些国家摆脱经济困境。这个冷酷的事实，是值得那些参加巴格达条约的中近东国家深思的：它们追随美国扩军备战，把自己国家的主权和命运出卖给美国，究竟会得到什么好处呢？
    杜勒斯为了掩饰美国的侵略活动，竟在安卡拉会议上，大肆污蔑苏联，特别是疯狂地攻击苏联对中近东国家的无条件援助。这当然是白费的。中近东人民从亲身体验中懂得谁是真正的朋友。在安卡拉会议闭幕的前一天，即1月29日，苏联和埃及两国本着真正的友好合作精神，签订了一项经济技术合作协定。正如埃及政府经济代表团团长西德基所说：不仅埃及人，而且全体阿拉伯人都深信苏联的友好援助，是从心底里迸发出来的真诚的心愿。
    今天，在中近东，和在全世界一样，和平已成为大势所趋。中近东各国人民热烈拥护苏联关于大国在中近东不使用武力和建立中近东无核武器和火箭武器区的两大和平倡议，而强烈谴责美国企图把中近东变为原子战争温床的阴谋。因此，为美国扩军备战和殖民侵略服务的巴格达条约，和艾森豪威尔主义一样，在中近东已经成为爱好和平人民的“众矢之的”。埃及总统纳赛尔说：巴格达条约的主要目的首先是为各大国的利益服务，而不是为各较小的成员国的利益服务。埃及政府并发表声明，坚决谴责在中东国家建立导弹基地的做法。叙利亚的国务部长阿基勒在评论安卡拉会议时也指出：巴格达条约纯粹是一个帝国主义性质的条约。中近东人民正为维护民族独立和争取把中近东变为和平地区而斗争。安卡拉会议的阴谋是注定要失败的，杜勒斯的奔波不过是往返徒劳而已。
