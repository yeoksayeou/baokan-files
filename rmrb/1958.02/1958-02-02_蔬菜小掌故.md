Vegetable Anecdotes

　　Spinach: In ancient times, there was a country in the West called Boleng, which produced "spinach." China's "spinach" was introduced from there. People called it "Bo?" because it came from Boleng, and later shortened it to "spinach." (See Wei Xuan's "Liu Binke Jia Hua Lu")

　　Eggplant: It is said that the son of Qian Liu, the King of Wuyue, was a cripple. At that time, the people in the Jiang and Zhejiang areas were afraid of violating the taboo, so they renamed "eggplant" as "Luo Su," which has been used until now. (See Wang Pizhi's "Mianshui Yantan")

　　Turnip: During the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Kongming always asked soldiers to plant "turnips" wherever he went with his troops. Therefore, it is also known as "Zhuge Cai" (Zhuge's vegetable). (See Liu Binke's "Liu Binke Jia Hua Lu")

　　Sweet Potato: The planting method of "sweet potato" was brought back from overseas by Fujianese during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty (Emperor Shenzong Zhu Yijun). Its place of origin is Luzon. (See Zhou Lianggong's "Min Xiao Ji")

　　Coriander: Originally named "Hu Sui" (barbarian coriander). During the "Five Barbarians Uprising in China" in the Jin Dynasty, people were afraid that the word "Hu" (barbarian) would offend the barbarians, so they renamed it "Yuan Sui". It has been introduced to China for two thousand years. It was brought back by Zhang Qian during his mission to the Western Regions in the Han Dynasty. (Qunfang Pu)

　　Yam: Originally called "Shuyu". Because the character "Yu" had the same pronunciation as the name of Emperor Daizong of the Tang Dynasty (Li Yu), it was changed to "Shan Yao" (mountain medicine). (See Zhou Mi's "Qidong Yeyu")

　　Chinese Cabbage: The "Chinese cabbage" is at its most fertile in the snowy winter. Because of its strong cold resistance, similar to the pine tree among trees, it was given the name "Song" (pine). (See Pi Ya)

　　Cucumber: Like coriander, its name was changed in the Jin Dynasty. Its original name was "Hu Gua" (barbarian melon).

　　Winter Melon: Some people write "winter melon" as "east melon", believing that since there is watermelon, there should be "east melon". In fact, "winter melon" gets its name because it can be pickled in salt or preserved in honey and eaten in winter. (The above two items are from Zhu Guozhen's "Yongchuang Xiaopin")

　　Peanut: It is said that "peanut" has a history of about three hundred years in China. In the early years of the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty (Emperor Xuan Ye), a monk named Ying Yuan brought back seeds from Japan for trial planting, and it quickly spread throughout the country. (See Zhao Xuemin's "Bencao Gangmu Shiyi")

　　蔬菜小掌故
    菠菜　古时，西方有一个波棱国，出产“菠菜”。我国的“菠菜”，就是从那里传入的。人民因为它来自波棱国，便把它叫做“菠?”，后来简称“菠菜”。（见韦绚刘宾客嘉话录）
    茄子　据说，吴越王钱镠的儿子是瘸子。当时江、浙一带人民恐怕触犯忌讳，把“茄子”改名“落酥”，一直沿用到现在。
      （见王辟之渑水燕谈）
    蔓青　三国时诸葛孔明用兵，每到一处，总要叫士兵种“蔓青”。因此，它又名“诸葛菜”。（见刘宾客嘉话录）
    山芋　“山芋”的栽种法，是明朝万历（神宗朱翊钧）年间，福建人从海外带回的。它的原产地是吕宋。（见周亮功闽小记）
    元荽　本名“胡荽”。晋朝“五胡乱华”时，人民怕胡字触犯胡人，改称“元荽”。它传入中国，已有二千年了，是汉朝张骞出使西域带回的。（群芳谱）
    山药　原叫“薯蓣”。因蓣字和唐朝代宗皇帝（李豫）的名字同音，所以改为“山药”。（见周密齐东野语）
    菘菜　“菘菜”肥美的时期，在风雪交加的冬天。因为它的抗寒力强，和树木中的松树差不多，就替它题了一个名字叫“菘”。（见埤雅）
    黄瓜　它也和元荽一样，在晋朝改的名字，原来的名字叫“胡瓜”。
    冬瓜　有人把“冬瓜”写作“东瓜”，认为既有西瓜，就应该有“东瓜”。其实，“冬瓜”的得名，是因为它可以盐腌，可以蜜渍，留到冬天食用的缘故。
  （以上两条，同见朱国祯涌幢小品）
    花生　相传“花生”在我国约有三百年历史。清朝康熙（玄烨）初年，一个名叫应元的和尚，从日本带回种子试种，很快传布全国。（见赵学敏本草纲目拾遗）
