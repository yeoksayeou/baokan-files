Xinhua News Agency report: The Director of the Information and Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Stefan Hermann, stated to a reporter from the German News Agency on January 28 regarding the "visit" to Taiwan by certain members of the West German Federal Parliament, that this is an extremely serious provocative act by the West German imperialist and militarist clique. It is a support of American war policies and also a malicious attack on the friendship between the German and Chinese peoples.

Hermann emphasized that the West German Federal Deputies' trip to Taiwan and the attitude of the Bonn government are unfriendly acts towards the People's Republic of China, and these actions are linked to the American occupation of Chinese territory. This demonstrates that West German imperialist elements fundamentally do not wish to establish normal relations with the People's Republic of China.

　　民主德国外交部新闻司长发表谈话
    斥西德一些议员“访问”台湾
    据新华社讯　据德意志通讯社报道，德意志民主共和国外交部新闻和情报司司长斯特凡·赫曼1月28日就某些西德联邦议院议员“访问”台湾一事向德意志通讯社记者发表谈话说，这是西德帝国主义者和军国主义者集团极其严重的挑衅行为。它是对美国战争政策的支持，同时也是向德国人民同中国人民的友谊的一次恶毒进攻。
    赫曼强调说：西德联邦议员的台湾之行和波恩政府的态度是对中华人民共和国不友好的行为，这种行为是同美国强占中国领土的作法连在一起的。这说明，西德帝国主义分子根本不愿同中华人民共和国建立正常关系。
