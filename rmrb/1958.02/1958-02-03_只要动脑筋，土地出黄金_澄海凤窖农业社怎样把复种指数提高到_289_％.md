　　"As long as you use your brain, land yields gold"
　　--How the Fenjiao Agricultural Cooperative in Chenghai increased its multiple cropping index to 289%
　　Huang Xiangqing, Chen Zhanghuai
　　Not long ago, we visited the fields of the Fenjiao Agricultural Cooperative in Chenghai County. Seeing the colorful and diverse crops, it was like entering an experimental farm. As we walked, we even became a bit confused about the season! Even in winter, people don't let the land lie idle. After the late rice harvest, the third crop—winter wheat and sweet potatoes—is planted. We saw clumps of tender green sweet potato vines already spreading out in the golden rice stalks. We walked to the other side of the field, where it was all green. Although it was winter, there were seven or eight kinds of crops sprouting or growing vigorously. Between the furrows of some late-season sweet potatoes, rows of green Dutch bean seedlings were just emerging from the soil. In the furrows of many sweet potato fields, rows of corn were growing neatly. Some of the rice paddies that had been harvested earlier had mounds of fresh soil piled up. With people pointing them out, we discovered two rows of tender green stars on top: one of Dutch beans and one of radishes, recently planted and just sprouting....

　　Such a beautiful field scene is truly enviable. No wonder some cooperative members said when talking about intercropping and crop rotation that it was really like performing magic. An old man said, "I've been farming for decades, but I always remembered the old saying that one piece of land can't produce two treasures. I never knew our land had so much strength, capable of continuously growing so many kinds of crops in a year!"

　　Huang Jifan, the Party Secretary of Fenjiao Township, while leading us to visit various crops, introduced how the Fenjiao Cooperative had, in the past two years, utilized the land's potential and comprehensively implemented intercropping and crop rotation systems. This enabled the cooperative's multiple cropping index to rapidly increase from 200% in 1955 to 289%, achieving the agricultural development plan's target of a multiple cropping index of 230% ten years ahead of schedule, and consequently bringing the lives of cooperative members up to the level of well-to-do middle peasants.

　　Originally, this agricultural cooperative, located in the Chaoshan Plain, had a large population and little land, with poor soil quality. Therefore, before liberation, 80% of the township's farmers went out to work as peddlers. Now, the entire cooperative has more than two thousand people, with an average of less than one mu of cultivated land per person. In the past, paddy fields were only planted with two seasons of rice each year, while dry land was planted with sugarcane, sweet potatoes, peanuts, etc., with not many varieties. Due to a lack of feed, the livestock industry was also undeveloped. From the establishment of the elementary cooperative in 1952 to 1955, the average annual income per member only increased from 77.2 yuan to 88.9 yuan. On the other hand, 30% of the cooperative's surplus labor force had no way to be employed. This problem had been troubling the cadres. Since the comprehensive promotion of intercropping and crop rotation in 1956, a way out has been found.

　　As we saw, most of the land in this cooperative is simultaneously growing two or more crops. According to statistics from eight hundred mu of sandy land, those that are planted five times and harvested five times a year account for about 50%, those that are four times account for 37.5%, and those that are three times account for 12.5%. For example, some dry land is mainly planted with soybeans in the early season, with corn intercropped; in the late season, it is mainly planted with sweet potatoes, with corn continuing to be intercropped; after the sweet potatoes are harvested, Dutch beans and radishes are planted, for a total of six harvests a year. Moreover, after intercropping, the number of main crop plants has not decreased. Due to the different needs and types of fertilizers required by each crop, there is no competition for fertilizer between the two crops. Paddy fields generally have two crops of rice, plus one crop of winter sweet potatoes with intercropped wheat. According to their statistics, intercropping one mu of land is equivalent to harvesting one and three-tenths mu of land. Last year, intercropping corn on six hundred mu of dry land increased revenue by more than seven thousand yuan.

　　While intercropping, a crop rotation system is also implemented. Based on soil quality, water conservancy, and other conditions, the cooperative divides the land into several rotation areas. The paddy fields here are all clay soil. As a result of planting rice year after year, the soil has hardened into large clumps. Farmers describe it as: "The soil becomes hard as flint when the sun is out, and sticky like plaster when it rains." After these paddy fields are rotated with sweet potatoes, a large amount of sand is mixed in to suit the growth of sweet potatoes. In addition, the sweet potatoes leave behind many roots, which gradually loosen the soil and increase organic matter. Therefore, after crop rotation, the yield of various crops has increased.

　　On the same land, after "performing a little magic" as the farmers say, very different results can be obtained: One hundred and sixty-two mu of land that originally grew rice last year rotated to sweet potatoes in the late season. After rotation, each mu yielded 5,500 jin of sweet potatoes, which increased the net income by 56.65 yuan compared to the original late rice (which yielded only 650 jin of grain per mu). Two hundred and nine mu of dry land used to be planted with sweet potatoes in the late season, and sugarcane and intercropped soybeans in the spring of the following year. Excluding the income from sugarcane, each mu yielded 3,500 jin of sweet potatoes and a small amount of soybeans, with a net income of 62.5 yuan per mu. Now, after water conservancy facilities were built, late-season rice rotation is implemented. Rice-bottom sweet potatoes are planted before the rice is harvested, and wheat is intercropped in the middle of the sweet potatoes after the rice is harvested. Wheat is then harvested the following spring before sugarcane is planted. In this way, excluding sugarcane, each mu yields 520 jin of rice, 4,500 jin of sweet potatoes, and 240 jin of wheat, with a net income of 114 yuan per mu, an increase of 51.5 yuan per mu compared to before the change in the farming system. These are such convincing accounts!

　　During our visit, we saw so many kinds of crops and forms of crop rotation and intercropping. Later, we learned that the economic value of planting various crops varied, so how do they avoid blindness and determine what to plant and how much to plant? Huang Jifan replied, "First, we must grasp the principle of ensuring both increasing the income of cooperative members and ensuring the completion of grain production tasks. Second, we must consider that the main crop and the intercrop must not affect each other, compete for fertilizer or land, and also consider the rational use of labor to avoid uneven workloads." He also explained that these were relatively common problems, and that you just need to use your brain and arrange the land. He said that the greater effort in promoting intercropping and crop rotation was to break the cooperative members' conservative thinking of "one piece of land cannot yield two treasures." The methods are firstly persuasion and education, and secondly, cadres doing experiments. The cooperative's cadres first experimented with dozens of mu in 1954, and then increased it to more than one hundred mu in 1955. Although these two years of experiments were successful, a debate had to be conducted before the full-scale promotion in 1956, and the ideological problem was finally solved by calculating accounts. Secondly, they spent a lot of effort on constructing irrigation water conservancy in dry land and leveling land of different heights so that it could be rotated with rice paddies. Another difficulty was that the need for fertilizer greatly increased. Huang Jifan said: "This difficulty was caused by intercropping, and it was also solved by intercropping." The livestock industry, which could not be developed here in the past due to a lack of feed, has now, after intercropping and crop rotation, increased by 10,000 dan of sweet potatoes, more than 500 dan of corn, and a large number of sweet potato vines and corn stalks, etc., of both fine and coarse feed in just one year. As a result, the number of pigs raised in the entire cooperative increased by 500 heads in one year (and has increased by another 300 heads this year), and the number of chickens, ducks, and geese also increased by 10,000. The increased manure reached more than 30,000 dan, plus mobilizing cooperative members to increase the accumulation of soil and miscellaneous fertilizer. Last year, an average of 320 dan of fertilizer was applied per mu throughout the year, which is also one of the reasons for promoting the increased production of various crops. Therefore, the cooperative's situation in the past two years shows that: "Intercropping, crop rotation, soil improvement, and the development of the livestock industry are interrelated and mutually promoting."

　　Due to the widespread development of agriculture and sideline industries (livestock) and increased income, the situation of slow and stagnant income increase in the few years after the establishment of the cooperative has changed! From 1952 to 1955, the average income per person only increased by 11.7 yuan. In 1956, when intercropping and crop rotation were fully implemented, the average income per person reached 105 yuan, an increase of 16.1 yuan compared to 1955, which was more than the increase in the past four years; the average income per household was 491 yuan, an increase of 18.9%. In 1957, due to further tapping of potential, the land change index increased from 267% in 1956 to 289%. In addition to the cooperative increasing public accumulation by more than 4,000 yuan, the average income per person increased to 108.3 yuan, and the income per household increased to 507.6 yuan. In 1956, more than 95% of cooperative members increased their income.

　　In the past, many farmers here were influenced by the capitalist ideology of wealthy middle peasants. They believed: "Relying solely on two pieces of rotten land, without thinking of more ways (referring to doing speculative business), honestly farming will only lead to a life of poverty!" Now, people say: "As long as you use your brain, land yields gold." Not long ago, the cooperative conducted the 1958 production plan, preparing to continue to tap the potential of the land. The first priority is to expand winter planting so that several hundred mu of land that has not yet reached the standard of three harvests a year can reach this standard. While formulating the plan, the cooperative members have already taken action. While harvesting rice, they are turning the soil and planting, while carrying sand to improve the soil. After the recent rural rectification movement, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of cooperative members has been unprecedentedly increased. When work is tight, they even go out to work at night. In the dark fields, lights shine everywhere, and there is a lot of noise everywhere.

　　“只要动脑筋，土地出黄金”
　　——澄海凤窖农业社怎样把复种指数提高到289％
　　黄向青　陈章淮
    不久以前，我们在澄海县凤窖农业社的田园间参观，看见那五彩缤纷多种多样的庄稼，像走进了一个试验农场一样。走着走着，连眼前是什么季节也有点儿迷惑起来了！就是在冬天，人们也不让土地闲着。晚稻收完，第三造作物——冬耕小麦和番茨，又种上了。我们看到番茨的一撮撮嫩绿的藤叶已在金黄的稻丛里蔓延开来。我们走到田野的另一边，那儿正是一派青绿，虽然这是冬季了，地上还有七八种庄稼正在萌芽或者蓬勃地成长着。在一些晚造番茨的垅沟之间，一条条荷兰豆的绿苗却刚刚绽出土面来。也有许多番茨田的垅沟间，整齐地生长着一排排玉米。有些较早收刈了的稻田，已培起了一垅垅新土，经人们指点，我们发现了上面有两行嫩绿的星星，一行是荷兰豆，一行是萝卜，是播种不久，才发芽的……。
    这样美丽的田园景象，真叫人羡慕。怪不得有些社员跟我们谈起间种轮作的问题时，说这真有点像耍法术。有一个老人说：“我耕田几十年了，可总是记得一地无两宝的老话，却不知道我们这地竟有偌大的气力，能一年不断地长出那么多样的庄稼来呢！”
    凤窖乡的党委书记黄继藩一边领着我们参观各种作物，一边介绍凤窖社怎样在这两年来发挥土地潜力，全面推行了间种和轮作制度，使全社土地的复种指数，从1955年的200％迅速提高到289％，提前实现了农业发展纲要规定的十年后达到的复种指数的指标——230％，并且因而使社员的生活赶上了富裕中农的水平。
    原来这个地处潮汕平原的农业社，人多地少，土质不良。所以解放前，全乡就有80％的农民出外做小贩。现在全社二千多人，平均每人所有耕地还不够一亩。过去水田每年只种两季稻谷，旱园种甘蔗、番茨、花生等，种类不多。因为饲料缺乏，饲养业也没发展起来。从1952年建立初级社到1955年，社员平均每人每年收入只从七十七点二元增加到八十八点九元。而另方面，全社却又有30％的剩余劳动力无法施展。这个问题，一直使干部们苦恼。自从1956年全面推广了间种轮作制后，才找到了一条出路。
    如同我们看到的一样，这个社里的每一块土地，大都同时生长着两种以上的庄稼。据八百亩沙洲园地的统计，一年里种五次收五次的约占50％，四次的占37.5％，三次的占12.5％。如有一部分旱地，早造主种大豆，间种玉米；晚造主种番茨，继续间种玉米；番茨收成后又种上荷兰豆和萝卜，一年共收六次。而且间种以后，主种作物的株数并没有减少。由于肥料需要的先后和种类不同，两种作物都不发生争肥的现象。水田一般是两造水稻，加上一造冬季番茨并间种小麦。据他们统计，每间种一亩土地，就等于一亩三分地的收获，去年在六百亩旱地上间种了玉米，就增加了七千多元的收益。
    在间种的同时，还配合实行轮作制度。这个社根据土质、水利等条件，把全社土地划为几个轮作区。这里的水田都是黏质土，年年种水稻的结果，泥土结成一大块一大块，农民形容说：“日出如火石，落雨如膏药。”这些水田轮种了番茨以后，因为要大量掺沙，以适应番茨生长，再加番茨又留下了许多根，就使土壤渐渐松软，增加了有机质。所以，经过轮作后，各种作物的产量都提高了。
    在同样的土地上，像农民说的“耍了一下法术”以后，就会得出大不相同的结果：有一百六十二亩原来种水稻的田，去年晚造轮种番茨后，每亩收番茨五千五百斤，比原作晚稻（每亩只收六百五十斤谷）的纯收入增加五十六元六角五分。有二百零九亩旱园，从前晚造种番茨，次年春种甘蔗和间种黄豆一亩，除甘蔗收入不算外，每亩田有番茨三千五百斤还有少量黄豆，每亩纯收入是六十二元五角；现在，修了水利，晚造实行轮种水稻，刈稻前种稻底番茨，刈稻后又在番茨中间间种小麦，次年春天刈了小麦才种甘蔗。这样，除甘蔗外，每亩收入稻谷五百二十斤，甘茨四千五百斤，小麦二百四十斤，每亩纯收入达到一百一十四元，比改变耕作制度前每亩增加了五十一元五角。这些，是多么令人信服的几笔账！
    我们在参观时，看到那么多种多样的作物和轮作间种的形式，后来又了解到种植各种作物所得的经济价值有高有低，那么，怎样避免发生盲目性，怎样确定该种什么和该种多少呢？黄继藩答复说：“首先是掌握既保证增加社员收入又保证完成粮食生产任务的原则，其次要考虑主种与间种作物之间必须互不影响，互不争肥争地，还要考虑到劳动力的合理使用，避免产生忙闲不均现象。”他还说明这是比较普通的问题，动动脑筋，把土地排排队就行了。他说，在推广间种轮作中，花了更大气力的是打破社员“一地无两宝”的保守思想。办法一是说服教育，二是干部作试验。该社干部在1954年就先试验了几十亩，1955年又增加到一百多亩，虽然这两年试验都成功了，但在1956年全面推广以前，还得进行了一次争辩，终于用算账的办法解决了思想问题。其次，他们花了很大气力的工作是，在旱园兴修灌溉水利以及把高低不同的土地平整，这样，才能跟水田轮种水稻。还有一个困难是肥料的需要大大增加了。黄继藩说：“这个困难因间种产生，又因间种解决了。”他们这里过去因饲料缺乏不能发展的饲养业，现在间种轮作后，仅去年一年就增加了一万担番茨、五百多担玉米和大批番茨藤叶、玉米秆等精的、粗的饲料，所以一年间全社养猪量就增加五百头（今年又增加了三百头），鸡鸭鹅的数目也增加了一万只，增加的粪肥达到三万多担，加上发动社员增积土杂肥，去年全年每亩平均就施下肥料三百二十担，这也是促使各种作物增产的原因之一。所以，该社两年来的情况说明了：“间种轮作、改良土壤以及发展饲养业，三者是有着互相关联、互相促进的关系的。
    由于农业和副业（饲养）的普遍发展和收入增加，建社后几年来收入的增加仍然缓慢和陷于停滞不前的局面就改变了！从1952年到1955年的四年间，每人平均收入才增加了十一元七角，全面实行了间种轮作的1956年，每人平均收入就达到一百零五元，比1955年增加了十六元一角，比过去四年里增加的还多；平均每户收入四百九十一元，增加了18.9％。1957年，因为进一步挖潜力，土地变种指数又从1956年的267％提高到289％，除了全社增加了公共积累四千多元外，每人平均收入又增加到一百零八元三角，每户收入增加到五百零七元六角。1956年就有95％以上的社员增加了收入。
    过去，这里的不少农民受过富裕中农的资本主义思想影响，他们认为：“单靠两块烂田破地，不多想办法（指做投机商业），老老实实，只落得一世受穷！现在呢，人们说：“只要动脑筋，土地出黄金。”不久以前，这个社进行了1958年的生产计划，准备继续发挖土地潜力，首先是扩大冬种，使几百亩尚未达到一年三熟的田地达到这个标准。在制订计划的时候，社员们就已经行动起来了，他们一边刈稻，一边翻地种地，一边挑沙改良土壤。经过最近一次农村整风运动的教育，广大社员的生产情绪空前提高，工作紧张的时候，他们连晚上也出动干活。在黑夜的田野上，到处有灯光照耀，到处有人声喧闹。
