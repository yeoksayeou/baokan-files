Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 15th: The Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant's converter workshop smelted 191 heats of steel on the 13th, breaking the national record of 180 heats per day, which they had set themselves fourteen days prior.

    When the workshop created the new record of 180 heats, Class A of the three shifts smelted the most heats, and Class B smelted the fewest. On the 13th, workers of Class B proposed to surpass Class A and take back the new record. They then exerted their energy and surpassed Class A's result from January 30th with a new shift record of 64 heats.

    When the workers of Class A heard that Class B had snatched the new record, they immediately proposed to seize the new record back. As a result, on the 13th, they surpassed Class B with a new shift record of 65 heats.

    再创全国新纪录
    据新华社上海15日电　上海第一钢铁厂转炉车间13日吹炼了一百九十一炉钢，打破了十四天前他们自己创造的日炼一百八十炉的全国新纪录。
    车间创造一百八十炉新纪录的时候，三班中甲班吹炼的炉数最多，乙班吹炼的炉数最少；13日，乙班工人提出要超过甲班，把新纪录拿过来。于是鼓起干劲以六十四炉的班新纪录，超过了甲班上月30日的成绩。
    甲班工人听说乙班把新纪录夺去了，立即提出要把新纪录抓回来。结果，13日又以六十五炉的班新纪录超过了乙班。
