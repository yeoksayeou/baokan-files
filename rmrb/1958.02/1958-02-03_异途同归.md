　　Different Paths, Same Destination

　　The People's Daily headline on January 30th was: "Both Red and Expert, Not Empty-Headed Politicians."

　　Politics is the soul. "Practitioners" who lose their political direction can certainly be seen as walking corpses. But what about empty-headed politicians? Can't they also be likened to wandering souls without a place to call home? Both are clumsy and insufficient to accomplish anything. Therefore, our opposition to empty-headed politicians is no less than our opposition to practitioners who have lost their direction.

　　However, opposing both does not mean that we don't want those who are Red but not expert, nor do we want those who are expert but not Red. Instead, it means that we want those who are Red to advance towards expertise, and those who are expert to advance towards being Red, each preserving their strengths and complementing their weaknesses, to be "both Red and expert." This is what we mean.

　　Therefore, those who are not expert are now studying their profession, and those who are not Red are now striving to improve themselves. Both are excellent. Different paths, same destination. We will also see a new leap forward in people. A leap forward from different angles towards a common direction. (Yan)

　　异途同归
    1月30日人民日报大字标题是：又红又专不做空头政治家。
    政治是灵魂，迷失政治方向的“实际家”，当然可以看作是行尸走肉；然而空头政治家呢？不也可以比作是失去了寄托的游魂吗？两者都是蹩脚，不足于成事的。于是，我们的反对空头政治家，并不亚于反对迷失方向的实际家。
    然而，对两者的反对，并不是红而不专者不要；专而不红者也不要；而是要红者向专前进；专者向红前进，各存其长各补其短，“又红又专”，此之谓也。
    于是，不专者去钻研业务了，不红者去努力锻炼了，都是好样的。异途同归，从人的身上我们也将看到新的跃进。从不同的角度，向共同的方向的跃进。　（延）
