　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th, Tokyo dispatch: Indonesian President Sukarno, who is currently recuperating in Japan, stated in Osaka on the evening of the 7th that he is confident that the problems currently occurring in Indonesia can be resolved satisfactorily.

　　President Sukarno pointed out in his statement that it is natural for a young country like Indonesia to encounter various difficulties in the process of growing into a great nation.

　　President Sukarno spoke to local Indonesian consulate personnel and overseas Chinese in Kobe, near Osaka, that noon. He said that revolution is a long process. Revolution takes time and is also difficult. He pointed out that every new country, and even old countries, will encounter obstacles and difficulties.

　　President Sukarno pointed out that in 1950, some people in Indonesia declared the establishment of an "Islamic State" and a "Republic of South Maluku." These events were difficulties that Indonesia had encountered. Thanks to the unity of the Indonesian people, these difficulties have been overcome.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 7th dispatch: Indonesian Army Headquarters spokesman Major Hasono said today that Army Chief of Staff Nasution recently held separate talks and meetings with many military leaders in Sumatra and East Indonesia. These military leaders stated that they are determined to implement the orders issued by the Army Chief of Staff regarding security and economic issues.

　　Hasono said that Nasution held talks on the 4th with various military power holders in Sumatra, including Balyan, commander of the 2nd Military Region of South Sumatra, with the exception of Lieutenant Colonel Hussein of Central Sumatra.

　　Hasono said that the secret meeting held in Sungai Dareh was discussed in detail during the talks, and measures to resolve this problem and "localize" it were also discussed. The Army Chief of Staff has ordered Hussein to submit a report on this issue.

　　It was previously reported that Hussein, Lubis, Simbolon, and others who betrayed the Indonesian central government, as well as some political figures such as Natsir and Sjafruddin, held a secret meeting in Sungai Dareh, a small town on the border of West Sumatra and Jambi. According to reports, this meeting was related to a plot to establish a "State of Sumatra."

　　Hasono said that some defense zone commanders in East Indonesia recently reported to the Army Chief of Staff that no "independence" declarations had occurred in their jurisdictions. The Army Chief of Staff also ordered the defense zone commanders of North, Central Sulawesi, and South and Southeast Sulawesi to implement orders prohibiting barter trade and related to security issues.

　　Hasono said that the Army Chief of Staff, at the invitation of former Vice President Hatta, held a two-hour meeting with Hatta. The meeting discussed the current situation in Central Sumatra and other issues.

    许多军事领袖拥护纳苏蒂安命令
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：正在日本休养的印度尼西亚总统苏加诺7日晚间在大阪发表声明说，他确信目前在印度尼西亚国内发生的问题可以得到圆满解决。
    苏加诺总统在声明中指出，像印度尼西亚这样的一个年轻的国家在成长为一个伟大的国家的过程中遭遇到各种困难是很自然的。
    苏加诺总统当天中午在大阪附近的神户曾经对当地的印度尼西亚领事馆人员和侨民发表了谈话。他说，革命是一个长期的过程。革命需要时间，同时又是困难的。他指出，每一个新国家，甚至于老国家都会碰到障碍和困难。
    苏加诺总统指出，1950年在印度尼西亚有人宣布建立“伊斯兰教国”和“南马鲁古共和国”，这些事件都是印度尼西亚遭遇过的困难。由于印度尼西亚人民团结一致，这些困难已经克服了。
    据新华社雅加达7日电　印度尼西亚陆军总部发言人哈索诺少校今天说，陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安最近曾经同苏门答腊和东印度尼西亚的许多军事领袖分别举行了会谈和会议。这些军事领袖表示，他们决心执行陆军参谋长所发布的有关安全和经济问题的命令。
    哈索诺说，纳苏蒂安4日曾经同包括南苏门答腊第二军区司令巴利安在内的苏门答腊各军权执掌者进行了会谈，只有中苏门答腊的侯赛尼中校没有参加。
    哈索诺说，在会谈中曾经详细地讨论了有关在双溪达腊举行的秘密会议的问题，会谈中还讨论了如何解决这个问题并且使这个问题“地方化”的措施。陆军参谋长已经命令侯赛尼就这个问题提出报告。
    以前曾经报道，背叛印度尼西亚中央政府的侯赛尼、卢比斯、西姆波朗等人和纳席尔、沙弗鲁丁等一些政治人物曾经在西苏门答腊和占碑边境的小镇双溪达腊举行了秘密会议。据报道，这次会议同建立“苏门答腊国”的阴谋有关。
    哈索诺说，东印度尼西亚的一些防区司令最近向陆军参谋长报告说，在他们的辖区中没有发生宣布“独立”的事件。陆军参谋长还命令北、中苏拉威西以及南和东南苏拉威西的防区司令执行禁止进行换货贸易和有关安全问题的命令。
    哈索诺说，陆军参谋长应前副总统哈达的邀请，同哈达进行了两小时的会谈。在会谈中讨论了有关目前中苏门答腊局势和其他问题。
