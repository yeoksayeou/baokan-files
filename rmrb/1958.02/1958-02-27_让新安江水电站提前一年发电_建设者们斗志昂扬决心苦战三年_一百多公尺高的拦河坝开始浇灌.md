    Let Xin'an River Hydropower Station Generate Electricity One Year Ahead of Schedule
    Builders are in High Spirits, Determined to Fight Hard for Three Years
    Pouring of the Over 100-Meter High Dam Begins
    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, February 26th) Reporter Liu Fan reports: The builders of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station recently put forward the slogan "Fight Hard for Three Years, Generate Electricity One Year Ahead of Schedule," striving to complete and put into operation this large hydropower station in 1960.
    The Xin'an River Hydropower Station is the first large-scale hydropower station in our country that is independently surveyed, designed, constructed, and equipped with domestically produced power generation equipment. The hydropower station's dam is 105 meters high. Its installed capacity is 580,000 kilowatts, twenty times larger than the Guanting Hydropower Station. Its power generation capacity is even greater than the famous Fengman Hydropower Station. After the Xin'an River Hydropower Station is completed, it will supply strong electricity to the Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing areas, and it can also block and store the floods of the Xin'an River. This will play a significant role in strengthening the power industry in our country and promoting the development of industry and agriculture in the Jiangnan region. The auxiliary projects of this hydropower station began construction in August 1956, with the original plan to generate electricity in 1961. After the Party Central Committee put forward the great call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products such as steel within fifteen years or a little more, the builders of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station were greatly encouraged and determined to advance the power generation time by one year.
    Currently, the concrete pouring project for the dam of this hydropower station has commenced. On the 17th, more than 15,000 employees of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station completed the excavation, drilling, grouting, and flushing of the first concrete pouring surface of the dam foundation pit. On the 18th, at noon, the leaders and chief engineer of the hydropower station gave the final acceptance of the dam foundation pit; in the afternoon, the commencement ceremony for the dam concrete pouring project was held. Attending this commencement ceremony were Chen Weida, Standing Committee Member of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor, Gu Chunlin, Deputy Mayor of Hangzhou, and representatives from the State Planning Commission, the Hydropower Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and other units.

    让新安江水电站提前一年发电
    建设者们斗志昂扬决心苦战三年
    一百多公尺高的拦河坝开始浇灌
    本报杭州26日电　记者刘凡报道：新安江水力发电站的建设者们，最近提出“苦战三年，提前一年发电”的口号，争取在1960年使这座大型水电站建成发电。
    新安江水电站是我国自己勘测、设计、施工和自制发电设备的第一个大型水电站。水电站拦河大坝高一百零五公尺。装机容量五十八万瓩，比官厅水电站大二十倍。它的发电能力比著名的丰满水力发电站还大。新安江水电站建成以后，将供应上海、杭州、南京地区强大的电力，还可以拦蓄新安江的洪水。这对壮大我国电力工业的力量，促进江南工农业生产的发展将起重大作用。这座水电站的辅助工程在1956年8月开始施工，原计划在1961年发电。党中央提出在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁等主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的伟大号召以后，新安江水电站的建设者们受到很大鼓舞，决心把发电时间提前一年。
    目前，这座水电站的拦河大坝混凝土浇捣工程已经开工。17日，新安江水电站的一万五千多名职工完成了拦河大坝基坑第一块混凝土浇捣面的开挖、钻孔、灌浆、冲洗等工程。18日中午，水电站的领导人和总工程师最后验收了大坝基坑；下午，举行了拦河大坝混凝土浇捣工程开工仪式。参加这一开工典礼的，有中共浙江省委常委、副省长陈伟达，杭州市副市长顾春林和国家计划委员会、水利电力部水电总局等单位的代表。（附图片）
