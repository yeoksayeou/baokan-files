I fully agree with the various reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang at the conference, and I propose that the conference adopt them.

I would now like to report on the current status and development estimates of the electrical industry in the Shanghai area, as well as the current issue of guaranteeing the power supply during the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. I would also like to offer a few opinions on catching up with Britain in the next fifteen years.

**Shanghai Electrical Industry Guarantees a Great Leap Forward in User Electricity Consumption**

The Shanghai Electrical Bureau originally planned to generate more than 2.4 billion kilowatt-hours this year, but now it has been decided to increase it to more than 2.6 billion kilowatt-hours to guarantee electricity for industrial and mining use in Shanghai and the Shanghai-Nanjing-Ma'anshan-Wuhu-Tongling area, and to guarantee electricity for agriculture in the suburbs of Shanghai and along the lines.

1.  Shanghai is one of China's oldest and largest industrial bases. Under the great call of the Party and the government, a fiery trend of a great leap forward in industrial production has already formed. Various industries have already set their own specific targets and plans for a leap in the quantity and quality of products. Our electricity industry's power generation target can only leap forward with the users' great leap forward, but our industry's entire staff has decided to show a fighting spirit and revolutionary vigor to resolutely guarantee their great leap forward, which is absolutely no problem. The original Shanghai Electrical Bureau's 1958 power generation was 2,483 million kilowatt-hours, which has been preliminarily discussed and raised to 2,613 million kilowatt-hours (including about 500 million kilowatt-hours from the original Nanjing Bureau and Huainan Bureau plants), accounting for about 12 percent of the national planned power generation. This number is an increase of nearly 20 percent compared to 1957. The standard coal consumption per kilowatt-hour will be reduced from the original 0.516 kilograms to 0.509 kilograms, saving about 22,000 tons of coal throughout the year. The cost reduction rate will be changed from the original 2.31 percent to 4.55 percent, which will increase the profit turned over by 8 million yuan.

Such a huge amount of electricity is generated by various power plants (including the Wangting Power Plant, which will be completed within the year) connected to a unified dispatching power grid. In addition to fully guaranteeing Shanghai's huge industrial electricity consumption, it will also guarantee electricity for industrial and mining use in the Shanghai-Nanjing-Ma'anshan (Ma'anshan)-Wuhu (Wuhu)-Tongling (Tongguanshan) area. In addition, it will also guarantee electricity for agriculture in the suburbs of Shanghai and along the lines.

The first Five-Year Plan was overfulfilled, first completing the task of socialist transformation, eliminating the century-old division of the power supply area in Shanghai, and incorporating it into a power grid and national plan; second, promoting unified dispatching and adjusting the load, greatly improving the power supply capacity.

The reason why we propose such a guarantee is not only relying on the unprecedented production enthusiasm of the masses, but also has its historical and measures-based basis. In order to explain the problem, please allow me to look back at the work achievements during the first Five-Year Plan period. Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, through the selfless labor of all employees and the cooperation of other industrial departments in Shanghai, we completed the following tasks:

First, we completed the task of socialist transformation, eliminated the century-old division of the city's power supply area, and incorporated them into a power grid and national plan. At the same time, through internal reforms, transformations, and successive political movements, the political awareness and labor enthusiasm of employees have been unprecedentedly improved, and a large number of outstanding advanced producers have emerged. In terms of production technology management systems and equipment maintenance, improvement, and supplementation, we have learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and done a series of work. Not only did we manage and improve the Yangshupu Power Plant, which the American imperialists claimed we could not manage, but also greatly improved the safe and economical operation level of the Shanghai electrical industry. This fact also negated the slander of the right-wingers that laymen cannot lead enterprises.

Second, we promoted unified dispatching, adjusted loads, and repaired three dilapidated power generation equipment, which increased the effective power supply to users by more than 40,000 kilowatts. We also expanded the Yangshupu and Zhabei Power Plants and renovated the Nanshi Power Plant, adding more than 50,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment. The overall achievements of the above measures can be listed as follows:

In total, in the last five years, the power generation equipment increased by about 20 percent in the later period, while the electricity sales increased by 48 percent, guaranteeing electricity for industrial and agricultural production over the years, saving more than 340,000 tons of standard coal, and turning over more than 300 million yuan in profits, all of which overfulfilled the first Five-Year Plan.

Shanghai Electrical Industry will continue to advance. This year, the newly built and expanded power plants have a power generation capacity of 94,000 kilowatts. We will strive for the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station to supply power ahead of schedule, build 1 million kilowatts of hydropower stations within ten years, build 400,000 kilowatts of new high-temperature and high-pressure large-scale thermal power stations, and establish nearly 1,000 kilometers of high-voltage transmission lines.

How will we continue to adapt to the successive great leaps forward in production in the future? The answer is to resolutely continue to advance on the basis of the above-mentioned steady and firm progress. In terms of equipment, the Wangting Power Station is being newly built, and the first phase of 88,000 kilowatts can be completed this year. The new 2×12,000 kilowatt unit expanded in Xiaguan, Nanjing, and the 6,000 kilowatt new unit expanded in Ma'anshan are also decided to be put into large-scale production this year. The Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station was originally scheduled to generate electricity in 1961, but now we are striving to start generating electricity one year ahead of schedule. If successful, it will generate 500 million kilowatt-hours, saving about 300,000 tons of coal. The Jiangnan area has more than 3 million kilowatts of hydropower resources. According to preliminary plans, 1 million kilowatts of hydropower stations can be built within ten years. In the eastern and western districts of the Jiangnan power grid, large-scale high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power stations of 400,000 kilowatts will also be newly built respectively. At that time, we will consider combined heat and power plants, the utilization of blast furnace gas, the comprehensive utilization of coal, and the manufacture of slag cement to improve economic benefits. We will also build nearly 1,000 kilometers of 220,000 volts or higher voltage transmission lines to connect Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Anhui to become the Jiangnan power grid with a total capacity of 2 million kilowatts.

In terms of organizational structure, production management, and technological improvement, we have also summarized the experience and lessons of the past five years, formulated measures, and prepared to leap forward again while running. Originally, the production conditions in the second Five-Year Plan period have been strengthened and improved in all aspects compared to the past. In addition, the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, the rectification movement last year, and the call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with Britain in fifteen years have given us endless vitality, courage to move forward, and full confidence. Many specific management and technical measures will not be discussed here.

The vast, rich, and beautiful Jiangnan area, under the leadership of the Party and the government, with the joint efforts of workers and peasants, coupled with the power of the giant spirit of electricity, will surely become a socialist paradise rapidly, which is beyond doubt. Looking forward to the future, I am truly fascinated.

**It Is Entirely Possible to Catch Up with Britain in About Fifteen Years**

2.  Opinions on catching up with or surpassing Britain in terms of the output of steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little more.

This great call made us feel extremely excited. According to the information in the People's Daily on February 1st, I made a little analysis. Among the seven major products, the ratio of the future required annual growth rate to the past achieved annual growth rate is higher only for electricity (18.5:21.2). This also shows that power generation must continue to grow rapidly for a long time in the future. This is worthy of attention and encouragement for our electricity workers and all relevant departments to prepare for struggle.

In terms of annual utilization hours of equipment, load rate, and annual growth rate of power generation, China's electrical industry has surpassed Britain; those that rely on years of construction accumulation and research improvement are currently not as good as Britain.

In order to know ourselves and the enemy, we have checked some information on the British electrical industry from the materials at hand. As a result, for indicators that rely on the superiority of the socialist system and the labor enthusiasm of the masses, such as the annual utilization hours of equipment (4,909 in China and 3,500 hours in Britain), load rate (the highest in the South Wales region of Britain is 59 percent, and 72 percent in Shanghai), and the annual growth rate of power generation (the average in China in the past five years is 21.2 percent, and the average in Britain in the past fifteen years is 6.6 percent), we have already surpassed Britain. For things that rely on years of construction accumulation and research improvement, such as indicators and levels in terms of equipment capacity, power generation, and science, technology, and manufacturing capabilities, we are currently not as good as Britain. This can point out the direction of our future efforts. These indicators and levels include: installed capacity, annual power generation, manufacturing capacity and installation ratio of high-temperature, high-pressure, and large-capacity units, ultra-high voltage and large-capacity power grids and the electrical equipment used, open-air power generation devices, nuclear power plants, underground gas power plants (experimental, under planning), etc. Therefore, their power plant thermal efficiency is higher and the investment per kilowatt of equipment is lower, which becomes a favorable factor in production and construction.

In terms of natural resources, hydropower or coal reserves, Britain is far inferior to China: China has more than 100 million kilowatts of hydropower resources and more than 1 trillion tons of coal reserves.

In terms of natural resources, whether it is hydropower or coal reserves, Britain is far inferior to China. The total capacity of the hydropower stations they have built and are planning to build is only more than 1.2 million kilowatts. Compared to China's situation of having more than 500 million kilowatts of hydropower resources (calculated based on average flow) and 960,000 kilowatts already built by the end of 1957, and 1.05 million kilowatts of hydropower stations continuing to be built and started this year, it is too small. Britain's coal reserves are only more than 100 billion tons, and the annual output has been fluctuating around 200 million tons for nearly 20 years, and the trend is declining. This is much worse than China's situation of having more than 1 trillion tons of coal reserves and an annual output of more than 100 million tons, which is rising rapidly.

The key is to give full play to our advantages, gradually eliminate our shortcomings, implement the principle of hydropower as the main and thermal power as the auxiliary, and comprehensive utilization of rivers, coupled with the cooperation of relevant industrial departments and scientific, technological, and educational research departments. It is absolutely guaranteed that the electricity production can catch up with Britain in fifteen years.

After understanding the above situation, it is certainly possible for us to catch up with Britain in about fifteen years, but we should try our best to give full play to our advantages and gradually eliminate our shortcomings. When eliminating shortcomings, I think:

(1) It is necessary to thoroughly implement the principle of hydropower as the main and thermal power as the auxiliary and comprehensive utilization of rivers stipulated by the state. The key is that relevant departments must solve the coordination problem in a timely and reasonable manner to speed up the progress and rationally utilize energy.

(2) It is necessary to solve the design and manufacturing problems of high-temperature, high-pressure, high-voltage, and large-capacity electromechanical equipment as soon as possible in a leap-forward manner. At the same time, the scale of the power grid should be expanded to accommodate these large-scale equipment.

(3) The principle of more, faster, better, and more economical should be implemented in a manner appropriate to local conditions and in a manner appropriate to the times. At present, the main thing is to combine with China's economic level, install simpler and cheaper plants and grids to save investment. But at a certain stage, we should create conditions to install larger, more complex, and more technologically advanced plants and grids to further save investment, reduce costs, accelerate capital accumulation, and accelerate construction speed.

(4) In order to achieve these requirements, it is not enough to rely solely on the efforts of electricity workers, because it involves a series of issues such as water conservancy, shipping, alloy steel smelting, heavy machinery equipment, high-insulation material supply, precision instrument and automatic equipment manufacturing, and high-parameter large-capacity equipment manufacturing. This requires the joint efforts of all relevant industrial departments and scientific, technological, and educational research departments. The comprehensive power science research work that has already begun must adapt to the requirements of the new situation and accelerate progress.

(5) Electricity production must be carried out simultaneously with consumption. Therefore, after solving the above problems, it is also necessary to obtain close cooperation with electricity consumption departments. Users should inform the electricity departments of the scale, location, and period of demand for loads as soon as possible, and the latter should also inform the users of the layout and progress plan of power supply in a timely manner. Only in this way can we prepare early, make reasonable arrangements, and complete the more, faster, better, and more economical construction tasks in all aspects. Among various users, I would like to especially mention the electrical metallurgy industry and the chemical fertilizer industry. They may become the largest users and rely on each other with the electrical industry to complete their respective tasks. We hope to have sufficient aluminum to replace copper, and we also hope that the annual output of ammonium sulfate will be 55 million tons in fifteen years (that is, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu will also catch up with Britain).

Fellow representatives, whether it is formulating correct industrial construction policies, strengthening equipment supply and production and sales coordination, or improving scientific and technological levels, none of them can be carried out at super speed under the correct unified leadership of our Party and government through the superior social system. Therefore, I absolutely believe that we can catch up with Britain in fifteen years. I would like to encourage myself with this and work together with the working people of the whole country!

    电业职工鼓足干劲保证工农业大跃进
    杨定安代表报告上海电业局职工的战斗精神和十五年赶上英国问题
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长及吴玉章主任在大会上的各项报告，并建议大会通过。
    我现在拟就上海地区电业的现状和发展估计以及当前如何保证工农业大跃进中的电力供应问题作一汇报。并对今后十五年赶上英国的问题提出几点意见。
    上海电业保证用户用电的大跃进
    上海电业局原订今年发电量为二十四亿多度，现决定提高为二十六亿多度，保证上海和沪、宁、马、芜、铜一带工矿用电，保证上海郊区和沿线农业用电。
    一、上海是我国最老大的工业基地之一，在党和政府伟大号召下，烈火般的工业生产大跃进趋势已经形成。各业在产品数量和质量飞跃提高方面多已订出自己的具体指标和计划。我们电业的发电量指标则只能随用户的大跃进而跃进，但是我业全体职工们决定拿出战斗精神和革命干劲，坚决保证他们的大跃进，则是毫无问题的。原订的上海电业局一九五八年发电量为二十四亿八千三百万度，经初步讨论后提高为二十六亿一千三百万度（其中包括原南京局及淮南局各厂约五亿度），约占全国计划发电量的百分之十二。此数较一九五七年增加近百分之二十。每度标准煤耗由原订的零点五一六公斤降为零点五零九公斤，全年可节煤约二万二千吨。降低成本率由原订的百分之二点三一改为百分之四点五五，由此可增加上缴利润八百万元。
    如此巨大的电量是由联接在一个统一调度的电网上的各电厂（包括年内建成的望亭发电厂）发出的。由此除充分保证上海的巨大工业用电外，更将保证沪、宁、马（马鞍山）、芜（芜湖）、铜（铜官山）一带的工矿用电。此外也将保证上海郊区及沿线各地的农业用电。
    第一个五年计划超额完成了，首先完成了社会主义改造任务，消除了百年来上海市供电区的分割局面，纳入一个电网和国家计划；其次推行了统一调度，调整负荷，大大提高了供电能力。
    我们这样提出保证，除了依靠群众空前的生产热情外，是更有其历史上和措施上的根据的。为了说明问题，请允许我回溯一下第一个五年计划期间的工作成就。在党和政府的正确领导及苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的无私援助下，通过全体职工的忘我劳动以及上海市其他工业部门的协作配合，我们完成了下列工作：
    首先完成了社会主义改造任务，消除了百年来全市供电区的分割局面，把它们纳入一个电网和国家计划。同时通过企业内部的改革改造工作和历次政治运动，使职工的政治觉悟和劳动热情空前提高，涌现出大批优秀的先进生产者。在生产技术管理制度方面及设备的检修、改进和补充方面，学习了苏联先进经验，做了一系列的工作。不仅管好了和改好了美帝国主义者扬言我们管不好的杨树浦发电厂，还大大地提高了上海电业的安全经济运行水平。这个事实也否定了右派分子所说外行不能领导企业的谰言。
    其次，推行了统一调度、调整负荷等措施，及修复了三台残破发电设备，使对用户的有效供电提高了四万瓩以上。我们更扩建了杨树浦和闸北发电厂，及改建了南市发电厂，增加了发电设备五万余瓩。以上措施所造成总的成绩可列表如下：
    总计五年来，在后期中增加发电设备约百分之二十，而售电量增加达百分之四十八，保证了历年工农业生产的用电，节约标准煤三十四万余吨，上缴利润三亿余元，全部超额完成了第一个五年计划。
    上海电业将继续迈进，今年新建和扩建的电站发电能力达九万四千瓩，争取新安江水电站提前供电，十年内建成水电站一百万瓩，新建高温高压大型火电站四十万瓩，建立近千公里的高压输电线。
    我们今后将怎样继续而持久地适应接踵而来的生产大跃进呢？回答是坚决在上述稳步而坚定前进的基础上，继续迈进。在设备方面，正在新建望亭发电站，第一期八万八千瓩可于今年完成。南京下关扩建的2×12，000瓩及马鞍山扩建的六千瓩新机亦决定于今年投入规模巨大的生产。新安江水电站原定一九六一年发电，现正大力争取提前一年开始发电。如果成功，则将发电五亿度，省煤约三十万吨。江南地区有水力资源三百余万瓩，据初步拟议，在十年内可建成水电站一百万瓩。在江南电网东西区也将分别新建高温高压大型火电站达四十万瓩。届时将考虑热电站、高炉煤气利用、煤的综合利用和制造炉渣水泥等以提高经济效益。更将建立近千公里二十二万伏或更高电压的输电线，把浙、沪、苏、皖联结起来，成为总容量达二百万瓩的江南电力网。
    在组织体制，生产管理，技术改进等方面，同样地我们已总结了五年来的经验和教训，订出措施，准备在奔驶中再跃进。本来第二个五年计划期中的生产条件在各方面都较前增强和改善了。加上去年反右派斗争、整风运动的胜利及党中央十五年赶上英国的号召，更给予我们以无穷活力，勇往直前，信心百倍。许多管理上和技术上的具体措施就不在这里多谈了。
    广阔、富饶而美丽的江南地区，在党和政府的领导下，工农劳动者的联合努力下，加上巨灵一般的电力，必将迅速成为社会主义乐园，是丝毫不用怀疑的。瞻望前途，真是不胜神往。
    十五年左右赶上英国完全可能
    二、关于十五年或更多一点时间在钢及其它主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的意见。
    这个伟大的号召使我们感觉异常兴奋。我根据二月一日人民日报资料，作了一点分析。在七种主要产品中，将来需要的年增产率对过去已获得的年增产率的比例，惟有电力是较高的（18.5∶21.2）。也就说明，今后发电量仍必须长期快速增长。这是值得我们电业工作者及全体有关部门注意和振作精神准备奋斗的。
    在设备每年利用小时数、负荷率和发电量逐年增长率方面，我国电业已超过了英国；那些依靠多年建设积累和研究提高的东西，目前还不及英国。
    为了要知己知彼，我们从手边有的资料，查明了一些英国电业情况。结果，凡是依靠社会主义制度优越性及群众劳动热情的指标，如设备每年利用小时数（中国为四千九百零九，英国为三千五百小时），负荷率（英国南威尔斯区最高为百分之五十九，上海为百分之七十二）及发电量逐年增长率（中国近五年平均为百分之二十一点二，英国近十五年平均为百分之六点六），我们都已经超过英国了。凡依靠多年建设积累和研究提高的东西，如设备容量、发电量及科学、技术、制造能力方面的指标和水平等，则我们目前还不及英国，这可以指出我们今后努力的方向。这些指标和水平包括：装机容量，年发电量，高温高压大容量机组的制造能力和装用比重，超高电压和大容量的电力网及所用的电气设备，露天发电装置，原子能发电厂，地下煤气发电厂（试验性的，在计划建设中）等。因此他们的电厂热效率较高，每瓩设备的投资较低，成为生产和建设方面的有利因素。
    在自然资源方面，水力或煤藏量，英国远不如我国：我国有一亿瓩以上的水力资源，煤储藏量一万亿吨以上。
    在自然资源方面，无论水力和煤藏量，英国是远不如我国的。他们已建成及计划建设中的水电站总容量只一百二十余万瓩。较之我国有五亿瓩以上的水力资源（按平均流量计算）及一九五七年底已建成九十六万瓩，今年继续施工和开工的就有一百零五万瓩水电站的情况，真太渺小了。英国的煤储藏量只千余亿吨，近二十余年来年产量一直在二亿余万吨左右波动，而且趋势是下降的。这较之我国煤储藏量一万亿吨以上，年产量已达一亿余吨，而且迅速上升的情况差多了。
    关键在于发挥我们的优点，逐步消灭我们的缺点，执行水电为主、火电为辅及河流综合利用的原则，加上各有关工业部门和科学技术教育研究部门的配合，在电力生产方面十五年后能赶上英国，绝对有保证。
    了解上面这些情况后，我们在十五年左右赶上英国，必是可能的，但应该尽量发挥我们的优点和逐步消灭我们的缺点。消灭缺点时我认为：
    （一）要贯彻执行国家规定的以水电为主火电为辅及河流综合利用的原则。关键是各有关部门必须及时地和合理地解决配合问题，以加快进行速度和合理利用能源。
    （二）要以跃进的方式，及早解决高温、高压、高电压、大容量机电设备的设计及制造问题。同时要扩大电网的规模来容纳这些大型设备。
    （三）要因地制宜而且因时制宜地来贯彻多快好省的原则。在目前主要是结合我国经济水平，装置较简和较廉的厂网，以节约投资。但到一定阶段，又应创造条件装置较大型、较复杂和采用更高度技术性的厂网，以进一步节约投资降低成本，加速积累资金和加速建设速度。
    （四）为了达到上述这些要求，单靠电业工作者的努力是不够的，因为牵涉到水利、航运、合金钢冶炼、重型机械装置、高绝缘材料供应、精密仪表及自动装置制造以及高参数大容量设备制造等一系列问题。这就需要全体有关工业部门和科学技术教育研究部门的共同努力。已经开始的综合性动力科学研究工作，尤须适应新形势的要求，加速进行。
    （五）电力生产必须与消费同时进行。因此，解决了上列问题后，还必须获得与用电部门密切的相互协作。用户要把负荷的规模、地点和需用时期，及早告知电力部门，而后者也要把供电的布局及进度计划及时告知用户。如此才能及早准备，合理安排，来完成各方面的多、快、好、省的建设任务。在各种用户中我想特别提出电气冶金工业和化学肥料工业。他们可能成为最大的用户，与电业相互依赖来完成各自的任务。我们希望有充分的铝以代铜，也希望十五年后硫氨的年产量为五千五百万吨（即每亩的施肥量也赶上英国）。
    各位代表们，无论是制订正确的工业建设政策、加强设备供应和产销配合、提高科学技术水平等等，无一不能在我们的党和政府的正确统一领导下，通过优越的社会制度，超速进行。因此我绝对相信十五年后能赶上英国。愿以此自勉，并和全国劳动人民共同努力！
