Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 15th. The full text of Premier Kim Il Sung's speech at the state banquet he hosted this evening to welcome the Chinese government delegation is as follows:

    Respected Comrade Zhou Enlai! Dear Comrades of the Delegation! Comrades, Friends!

    I would like to once again extend a warm welcome to the government delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by our close friend, Comrade Zhou Enlai.

    The government delegation of the People's Republic of China is visiting our country at a time when the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland has entered its most important stage.

    This visit will further inspire the Korean people's just struggle and add new strength to the struggle of our working people. At the same time, your friendly visit to our country will be a great contribution to further strengthening and developing the friendly relations between our two peoples.

    The friendship between our two peoples has been formed and developed through a long period of common struggle.

    Today, the peoples of Korea and China are closely united in the big family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and have formed close cooperative and friendly relations in the common struggle to defend socialist achievements and world peace.

    The friendly relations between the peoples of Korea and China have fully demonstrated their power during the war against the American armed invaders and in the post-war period.

    We will continue to work to strengthen the fraternal friendship and unity with the Chinese people, our close friends and helpers. We will always advance side by side with the great Chinese people.

    The comprehensive support and solidarity that the Chinese people have consistently given to the Korean people's just struggle is a great force guaranteeing the realization of the peaceful reunification of our motherland.

    The Korean people will surely win brilliant victories in the struggle to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and build socialism, and gloriously defend the eastern outpost of the socialist camp.

    Comrades!

    Please allow me to propose a toast to the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to the eternal and immortal friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China, to the Chinese Communist Party and the government of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and to the health of the respected Comrade Zhou Enlai and all the comrades of the delegation!
