    Misfortunes Never Come Singly
    Not long ago, American newspapers reported on the serious rat infestation in the United States and the government's indifference to it. The day before yesterday, French authorities also announced that the number of rats in France exceeded the total population of the country, with 50 million rats causing 200 billion francs worth of damage to France each year. It can be said that misfortunes never come singly.
    In fact, this is not a strange or new thing. In capitalist countries, the rulers do not care about the suffering of the people, so how can they care about the harm caused by rats? However, at a time when our country is frequently reporting good news about the elimination of the four pests, such news has a particularly fresh significance for us.

    无独有偶
    不久以前，美国报刊报道了美国鼠祸严重，政府熟视无睹的状况。前天法国当局也宣布：在法国老鼠数目超过了全国人口总数，五千万只老鼠每年给法国造成价值两千亿法郎的损害。亦可谓无独有偶。
    其实这并不是什么奇怪的、新鲜的事情。在资本主义国家里，统治者不关心民间疾苦，哪里管什么老鼠为患？不过正在我国消灭四害的捷报频传的时候，这样的消息对于我们倒是有着特别新鲜的意义。
