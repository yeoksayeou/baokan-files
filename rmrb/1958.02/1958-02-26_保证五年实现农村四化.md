Guarantee the Realization of Rural Four Modernizations in Five Years
Liu Shijie, Secretary of the CPC Yuxi Prefectural Committee, Yunnan

Simultaneous Development of Agriculture and Industry

During the First Five-Year Plan period, agricultural production in Yuxi Prefecture developed significantly. The total agricultural output value in 1957 increased by 119.3% compared to 1952.

The development of agricultural production in Yuxi Prefecture is inseparable from the vigorous construction of water conservancy projects. Before 1952, among the 2,020,000 mu of land in the entire prefecture, only 200,000 mu were stable paddy fields. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the entire Party mobilized to build water conservancy projects, blocking rainwater, digging out spring water, and pumping up lake water, so that the stable paddy fields rapidly increased to 800,000 mu. Now, every county, district, township, and commune has reservoirs and dams, changing the past situation of drought in nine out of ten years. The lives of the people throughout the prefecture have generally reached the level of middle peasants, and most have reached the level of prosperous middle peasants.

In the past, Yuxi Prefecture was not only backward in agriculture but even more backward in industry. In 1950, there was only a small coal mine with an annual output of more than 200 tons of coal and a 19-kilowatt power plant for lighting.

After agricultural cooperation, in addition to vigorously grasping water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, we also firmly grasped local industry. In the development of industry, we have always implemented the policy of "mobilizing the whole people, mobilizing the whole Party, and having the secretaries take action," so industry has developed relatively quickly. The output value in one day in 1957 was equivalent to the past eight months, and this year it will be equivalent to the past one and a half years. To date, we have built and expanded a total of 70 enterprises. The number of power machines has also increased from one in 1950 to 110, and the power of electrical equipment has increased from 19 kilowatts in 1950 to 1,538 kilowatts, and will reach 4,138 kilowatts this year.

In the past, Yuxi Prefecture not only bought general industrial products from other places, but even feather dusters were shipped from Guangdong, bamboo chopsticks from Sichuan, and carrying poles from Guizhou; it sold hides and bought back leather and leather shoes; it sold wood and bought back buckets. Now, we have more than 200 major products, and the proportion of local goods in the market has increased. In 1957, local goods accounted for 60% of the 37.8 million yuan of materials balanced within the prefecture.

Produce What Agriculture Needs

Our local industry was forced to "launch" under the circumstances of having no other choice. After agricultural cooperation, the area of rice fields expanded, and the area of cash crops also expanded. For example, the sugarcane planting area was only 21,000 mu in 1955, but it developed to 43,000 mu in 1957, and will reach 60,000 mu this year; the area of flue-cured tobacco was 145,000 mu in 1955, reached more than 302,000 mu in 1957, and will reach 330,000 mu this year; the area of oil crops was more than 165,000 mu in 1955, reached 295,000 mu in 1957, and will reach more than 270,000 mu this year. This inevitably requires corresponding development of processing industries. If the sugarcane planted in 1957 were all squeezed by traditional methods, it would not be finished even if production continued throughout the year. We manufactured 71 small sugar presses, and in addition to selling them to other areas, we installed 56 ourselves, which can squeeze 33,600 mu of sugarcane, not only saving a large amount of manpower and animal power but also producing more than 7 million jin of brown sugar. In order to adapt to the development of flue-cured tobacco production, in 1957, we produced 51,430 tons of coal. Now, the entire prefecture has coal kilns.

For agriculture to make a great leap forward, it is necessary to improve the attendance rate and, at the same time, find ways to save all possible labor. To this end, we manufactured 47 small rice milling machines, which were installed in towns, market towns, and some rural areas. Each machine can mill 25,000 jin of rice per day, which can replace 200 people pounding rice, saving a total of 9,400 people. In the high tide of water conservancy construction, we organized workers and handicraft cooperative members to go to the reservoir construction sites to create tools such as flying scoops, earth carts, sheep horn rollers, small iron rails, and mine cars, so that many construction sites basically eliminated the phenomenon of people carrying loads on their backs. According to incomplete statistics, more than 30,000 people are saved every day. At the same time, various places also replaced manpower with animal power and animal power with water power according to local conditions. For example, Lufu County plans to promote 600 horse-drawn waterwheels this year, and the entire county can basically eliminate the phenomenon of people drawing water. The handcarts on the reservoir construction sites have also been extended to fertilizer accumulation. The first, second, and fifth districts of Jiangchuan proposed that each household should have a handcart to eliminate the phenomenon of people carrying loads on their backs in various tasks within a short distance.

The water resources in Yuxi Prefecture are abundant, and the preliminary estimate is that the power generation capacity can reach more than 10,000 kilowatts. Last year, we made several small water turbines, and the results of their use in counties such as Eshan and Tonghai were very good. This year, we plan to build another 2,000 kilowatts of hydropower.

Agricultural production requires fertilizer, and Yuxi Prefecture has very rich resources of phosphate fertilizer, potash fertilizer, and nitrogen fertilizer. Phosphate fertilizer production began in the past few years, and this year we will start producing other kinds of potash fertilizer and nitrogen fertilizer. This year, we plan to produce more than 30,000 tons of chemical fertilizer. A bacterial fertilizer plant we built has also been put into production.

After agricultural development, the people's lives are prosperous, and the production of means of livelihood must also keep up accordingly. In the first half of last year, people had to queue up to buy wine, and the masses had opinions; in the second half of the year, the production of fruit wine was developed, and the supply of wine was no longer tight, and at the same time, the sales of fruits were expanded. At the end of last year, we also began to establish wineries in mountainous areas to use acorns to brew wine and alcohol. This not only met the needs of the people's lives but also developed the mountain economy. In addition, we also specially built brick and tile factories, coal factories, gypsum factories, asbestos factories, manganese mines, and cobalt mines in Chenggong, Jinning, Kunyang, Yimen, Jiangchuan, Huaning, Yuanjiang, and Tonglu counties to support the industrial construction of Kunming and other places. The manganese ore produced in Tonglu is two-thirds cheaper than that transported from other provinces. This year, we plan to build four more copper mines and four lead mines.

The Whole Party Takes Action, Mobilizing the Masses

In the past two years, Yuxi's local industry has been able to leap forward at a relatively large pace on a backward foundation, which is inseparable from the Party committee's management of money. In the past, because the Party committee only managed agricultural production and did not manage financial revenue and expenditure, some money that should not have been spent was spent, but there was no money to do things that needed to be done urgently. Later, Party committees at all levels, especially the secretaries, managed the money, concentrating every bit of funds and using them where they were most needed. After the Party committees of Jiangchuan, Yimen, Xinping, and Yuanjiang counties managed financial revenue and expenditure, each county had tens of thousands of yuan of funds to invest in local industry every year. This year, we initially plan to invest 6.52 million yuan, not including the excess profits of local industry. In the future, we also plan to take 50% of the infrastructure construction fees of agricultural cooperatives to build water conservancy projects, and 50% will be used by cooperatives to run processing industries and various smelting and mining operations. In addition, the accumulation of handicraft cooperatives can also invest about 1,000 yuan in local industry within five years.

Developing local industry, like other work, is impossible without the active leadership of Party committees at all levels, the whole Party taking action, and mobilizing the masses. Last year, the prefectural Party committee held more than ten meetings specifically to study local industry, and this year it also studied seven or eight times separately, and deployed the future production and construction plans at the plenary committee. Some comrades of the prefectural Party committee also personally went to factories to hold worker symposiums to help arrange production and trial-produce new products. Many county Party secretaries personally led cadres to the mountains to find coal and phosphate mines, and went deep into workshops and construction sites to specifically help study production management issues.

Make Do With What You Have, Careful Calculation

The only way to accelerate the construction of local industry is to run enterprises diligently and thriftily, make do with what you have, and live frugally. We did not take this road smoothly. There were disputes about what to develop and how to develop it. Some people said: To develop, you have to ask the higher authorities for money, saying that "even a clever wife can't cook without rice." Some people blindly sought large projects, not doing anything at all or wanting to do big things, and comparing themselves to large factories in terms of equipment and living standards.

The Party committee promptly studied and corrected these ideas, and promoted the enthusiasm of the whole Party and the broad masses of the people. After the leadership of Huaning Gypsum Factory corrected their thinking, they used a public house and a mountain temple to build it. Many other small factories and mines also used public houses and dilapidated temples as factory buildings, so they generally achieved less investment and quick results. The mining of coal mines, phosphate mines, etc., adopted the method of producing while prospecting, and no fixed buildings were built until the resources were clarified. This avoids wasting funds due to unclear resources, and also avoids not actively producing due to unclear resources.

While strictly implementing the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, we also emphasized that local industry must rely on the masses to run it, and the public cannot take care of everything. Last year, if all the equipment for the newly built small sugar factories was paid for by the state, each sugar press would cost two to three thousand yuan. We adopted the method of combining the state and agricultural cooperatives, with the state providing machinery and the agricultural cooperatives providing manpower and civil engineering construction. As a result, the entire region saved more than 300,000 yuan and shortened the construction period.

In terms of equipment, we tried our best to "buy old and renovate new," sending people to Kunming, Shanghai, and other places to collect discarded and idle equipment. The lathes of Yuxi Iron Factory for manufacturing sugar presses, only two were new; the only small planer in the factory was used as a washing rack by another factory and sold to us as scrap iron.

For factories with seasonal production, we implement diversified operations to make full use of manpower and equipment. After the power of the sugar presses is used to squeeze sugar, it is transferred to rice milling, water pumping, and cotton ginning. After the oil mills squeeze rapeseed, they squeeze sesame and peanuts, and the surplus power equipment is used for rice milling, flour milling, etc. Correspondingly, many workers have also learned several technologies, and do whatever they can.

Factories Everywhere, Workers Everywhere

Even so, our local industrial equipment is backward and our technical strength is poor, and it is not without difficulties to meet the needs of agricultural development and people's lives. We adopted the method of "old hens laying eggs," with one large factory leading several small factories to solve this problem. This year, in order to ensure the supply of water conservancy tools, Yuxi Iron Factory led several small factories to help train technology and trial-produce new products. After the trial production was successful, the small factories produced what they could; products that were large in quantity and urgently needed were produced by several factories in cooperation. The more complex parts were produced by factories with better conditions, and the rough parts were processed by small factories.

For general scattered small factories, we adopted the method of decentralized establishment, building factories wherever there are raw materials and producing whatever is needed. The goal of townships and communes running industries is our goal. And this is exactly what local industry itself requires. We have built many processing industries in the deep mountains, processing wild crops that no one has ever cared about into paper, fine wine..., which effectively improved the living standards of the people in mountainous areas. We organized farmers to mine coal, smelt iron, and mine lead, manganese, cobalt, nitrate, asbestos, and other mines, which is beneficial to the masses and also supports the country. This year, we plan to organize farmers to smelt 10,000 tons of iron and build small steel mills to refine some of the iron into steel, so that we can produce enough steel for this year.

Because we have "factories everywhere," we can also achieve "workers everywhere." Last year, many small sugar factories were newly built in Yuanjiang, Xinping, and other places, with one in every small mountain gully with 400 to 500 mu of sugarcane. Workers are transferred from rural areas for training. After mastering certain technologies, they immediately start production. After the sugarcane is squeezed, they return to rural production. They are both workers and farmers. The six iron smelting earth furnaces built in the deep mountains and wild jungles of Xinping County, the fuel and raw materials are all mined by members of agricultural cooperatives during slack farming seasons.

Transform the Backward Countryside into a Modernized Countryside

In the upsurge of socialist construction, the Party and the people of Yuxi Prefecture have mustered their strength, responded to the call of the Party, vigorously built water conservancy projects, and at the same time carried out large-scale local industrial construction, to complete the two five-year plans in three years. Now, 250,000 people in the region are building water conservancy projects every day, and 850,000 mu will be completed this year. The number of medium-sized reservoirs will increase from 19 in the past to 67. These projects have all started construction and will be completed by more than 90% by the end of March. In addition, 280,000 people are also engaged in fertilizer accumulation and small spring processing, and the labor attendance rate in the region has reached more than 90%.

In terms of industry, the factories in various counties are also actively surging for the great leap forward in agriculture. They have manufactured and processed a large number of soil rolling machines, small iron rails, and gate valves for construction sites. The prefecture and counties are building factories, including power plants, oil presses, sugar presses, non-ferrous metal smelting plants, and iron factories for manufacturing machines. We have formulated a five-year plan for the development of local industry to guarantee the realization of farmland water conservancy, agricultural semi-mechanization, rural electrification, and fertilizer chemicalization in rural areas within five years. We will devote all our strength to strive to transform the backward countryside into a modernized countryside within five years.

    保证五年实现农村四化
    中共云南玉溪地委书记　刘世杰
    农业工业同时发展
    在第一个五年计划期间，玉溪专区的农业生产有了较显著的发展，1957年的农业总产值比1952年提高了119.3％。
    玉溪专区农业生产的发展是跟大力兴修水利分不开的。1952年以前，全专区的二百零二万亩土地中，稳定水田才有二十万亩。在第一个五年计划期间，我们全党动手兴修水利，把雨水堵起来，把泉水挖出来，把湖水抽上来，使稳定水田迅速增加到八十万亩。现在已经做到县县区区有水库，乡乡社社有坝塘，改变了过去十年九旱的局面，全专区人民的生活也普遍达到了中农水平，大多数达到了富裕中农的水平。
    过去，玉溪专区不仅农业落后，工业更落后。在1950年的时候，全区只有一个年产二百多吨煤的小煤厂和一个供照明用的十九瓩的电厂。
    农业合作化后，我们除大力抓水利和积肥外，还狠狠地抓了地方工业。在发展工业中，我们始终执行着“全民动员、全党动员、书记动手”的方针，所以工业发展得比较快。1957年一天的产值已抵得上过去的八个月，今年，将抵得上过去的一年半。到目前为止，我们新建和扩建的企业总共有七十个。动力机也从1950年的一部增加到一百一十部，电力设备功率从1950年的十九瓩增加到一千五百三十八瓩，今年内将要达到四千一百三十八瓩。
    过去，玉溪专区不仅从外地买进一般工业品，连鸡毛掸子也从广东运来，竹筷子从四川运来，扁担从贵州运来；卖出皮子，买回皮革、皮鞋；卖出木材，买回水桶。现在，我们已有二百多种主要产品，地方货源在市场上的比重增加了，1957年属专区平衡的三千七百八十万元物资中，地方货源就占了60％。
    农业需要什么就生产什么
    我们的地方工业是在不得不干的情况下被迫“上马”的。农业合作化后，稻谷面积扩大了，经济作物面积也扩大了。如甘蔗种植面积，1955年才二万一千亩，1957年就发展到四万三千亩，今年将要达到六万亩；烤烟，1955年是十四万五千亩，1957年已达到三十万二千多亩，今年将要达到三十三万亩；油料作物，1955年是十六万五千多亩，1957年已达到二十九万五千亩，今年将要达到二十七万多亩。这样就不能不相应地发展加工工业。1957年种的甘蔗，如果全靠土榨，即使整年开工也榨不完。我们自己制造了七十一部小型榨糖机，除卖给外区外，自己安装了五十六部，可榨三万三千六百亩甘蔗，不但节约了大批人力、畜力，还可以多出红糖七百多万斤。为了适应烤烟生产的发展，1957年，我们生产了五万一千四百三十吨煤，现在，全专区都有煤窑了。
    农业要大跃进，就必须在提高出勤率的同时，想尽办法节省一切可以节省的劳动力。为此，我们制造了四十七台小型碾米机，分装在城镇、集镇和部分农村里，每台每日可以碾大米二万五千斤，可以代替二百人椿米，共节约人力九千四百个。在兴修水利的高潮中，我们组织了工人、手工业社员到水库工地去，创制了飞兜、地车、羊角碾、小铁轨、矿车等等工具，使许多工地基本上消灭了人挑人背的现象。据不完全的统计，每天节约的人力有三万多个。与此同时，各地还因地制宜地以畜力代替人力，以水力代替畜力。如把麓县今年计划推广马拉水车六百部，全县可以基本上消灭人戽水现象。水库工地上的手推车，也已推广到用在积肥方面。江川的一、二、五区提出每户要搞一辆手推车，在短距离内，在各种工作中，都要消灭人挑人背现象。
    玉溪专区的水利资源是丰富的，初步估计发电能力可以达到一万多瓩。去年我们制了几种小水轮机，从峨山、?江等县使用的效果来看，很好。
    今年，我们计划再搞二千瓩的水力发电。
    农业增产需要肥料，玉溪专区有非常丰富的磷肥、钾肥和氮肥的资源。磷肥在前几年已开始生产，今年要把其他几种钾肥和氮肥搞起来。今年我们计划生产化学肥料三万多吨。我们建设一个细菌肥料厂，也已投入生产。
    农业发展后，群众生活富裕了，生活资料的生产也必须相应地赶上。去年上半年，买酒要排队，群众有意见；下半年发展了果酒生产，酒的供应就不紧张了，同时还扩大了果子的销路。去年年底，我们还开始在山区建立酒厂，利用橡子酿造酒和酒精。这样，不但满足了群众的生活需要，而且发展了山区经济。此外，我们还在呈贡、晋宁、昆阳、易门、江川、华宁、元江、?鹿等县专兴建砖瓦厂、煤厂、石膏厂、石棉厂、锰矿厂、钴矿厂等，支援昆明等地的工业建设。?鹿出产的锰矿比从外省运来的便宜三分之二。今年我们计划还要兴建四个铜矿和四个铅矿。
    全党动手　发动群众
    两年多来，玉溪地方工业能够在落后的基础上以比较大的步伐跃进，是和党委管钱分不开的。以前，由于党委只管农业生产不管财政收支，一些不该花的钱也花了，而急需要办的事却没有钱办。后来，各级党委特别是书记都管钱，把一点一滴的资金集中起来，用到最需要的地方去。江川、易门、新平、元江四个县党委管财政收支以后，每个县每年都有几十万元资金投入地方工业。今年我们初步计划，不连地方工业的超额利润，可投资六百五十二万元。今后我们还准备在农业社的基建费中拿50％来搞水利，50％由合作社办加工工业及各种冶炼开采。另外，手工业社的积累中，五年内也有一千元左右可以投入地方工业。
    发展地方工业也和其他的工作一样，没有各级党委的积极领导，全党动手，发动群众，是不可能的。去年地委召开专门研究地方工业的会议就有十多次，今年也分头研究了七、八次，并在全体委员会上布置今后的生产基建计划。有的地委同志还亲自下厂召开工人座谈会，帮助安排生产和试制新产品。有许多县委书记都亲自带领干部上山找煤，找磷矿，深入到车间、工地具体帮助研究生产管理问题。
    因陋就简　精打细算
    加快地方工业建设的唯一道路，是勤俭办企业，因陋就简，精打细算过日子。这条道路，我们并不是顺顺当当就走过来的。对发展什么，怎么发展等问题，有过争论。有的人说：要发展就得请上级拿钱，说什么“巧媳妇难为无米之炊”。有的人盲目贪大，不搞则已，一搞就想搞大的，在设备上生活上都向大工厂看齐。
    党委及时地研究并纠正了这些思想，发扬全党和广大群众的积极性。华宁石膏厂在纠正了领导的思想以后，利用一所公房和一所山神庙就建设起来了。其他许多小厂矿也多是用公房、破庙作厂房，因此一般都做到了投资少收效快。煤矿、磷矿等等的开采，采取了一面生产一面钻探的办法，在资源未摸清前一律不搞固定建筑。这样就不致因资源不清而浪费资金，也不致因资源不清而不积极生产。
    在厉行勤俭办企业的同时，我们还强调了地方工业必须依靠群众来办，公家不能什么都包下来。去年兴建的小型榨糖厂，如果全部设备都由国家拿钱，一部榨糖机就需要两三万元。我们采取了国家和农业社相结合的办法，国家出机器，农业社出人力，搞土木建筑。这样做的结果，全区节约了三十多万元，并缩短了基建时间。
    在设备方面，我们尽量“买旧整新”，派人到昆明、上海等地搜集废旧的闲置设备。玉溪铁工厂制造榨糖机的车床，只有两部是新的；厂里唯一的一部小龙门刨，是别的厂已当了洗衣架，当作废铁卖给我们的。
    对生产有季节性的厂，我们实行多种经营，使人力和设备得到充分的利用。榨糖机的动力榨完糖后，就调去碾米、抽水、轧花。榨油厂榨完菜子榨芝麻、榨花生，多余的动力设备就用来碾米、磨面等等。跟这相适应，许多工人也都学会了好几种技术，有什么就干什么。
    到处有工厂　到处有工人
    尽管如此，我们地方工业设备落后、技术力量差，要满足农业发展和人民生活的需要不是没有困难的。我们采取了“老母鸡下蛋”的办法，一个大厂带几个小厂解决这一问题。今年为了保证水利工具的供应，玉溪铁工厂带上几个小厂，帮助培养技术、试制新产品，试制成功后，小厂能生产的就由小厂生产；大宗的又是急需的产品就由几个厂协作，较复杂的部件由条件较好的厂生产，粗糙的由小厂加工。
    对于一般零星小厂，我们采取分散建立的办法，那里有原料，就在那里建厂；那里需要什么，那里就生产什么。乡乡社社办工业就是我们的奋斗目标。而这也正是地方工业本身所要求的。我们把许多加工工业都建在深山里，把历来无人过问的野生作物加工成纸张、美酒……，这就有效地提高了山区人民的生活水平。我们组织农民挖煤，炼铁，挖铅、锰、钴、硝、石棉等矿，既有利于群众，也支援了国家，今年我们计划组织农民炼铁一万吨，再建小炼钢厂把一部分铁炼成钢，这样我们今年就可生产足够用的钢。
    因为我们是“到处有工厂”，所以也就可以做到“到处有工人”。去年元江、新平等地新建了许多小糖厂，有四、五百亩甘蔗的小山沟，就摆上一个。工人从农村调来培训。掌握一定技术后即进行生产，甘蔗榨完后就又回到农村生产。他们是工人又是农民。在新平县深山野箐中建的六个炼铁土炉，燃料、原料都是农业社的社员利用农闲采挖的。
    把落后的农村变为现代化的农村
    在社会主义高潮建设中，玉溪专区的党和人民群众一起鼓足了劲头，响应党的召唤，大力兴修水利，同时开展较大规模的地方工业建设，要把两个五年计划在三年内完成。现在全区每天有二十五万人兴修水利，今年将完成八十五万亩。中型水库将从过去的十九个增加到六十七个。这些工程现在已全部动工，到3月底就能完成90％以上。此外，投入积肥和小春加工的也有二十八万人，全区的劳动出勤率已达到90％以上。
    在工业方面，各县的工厂也正积极地为农业大跃进而高涨着。他们为建设工地制造、加工了大批的轧土机、小铁轨和闸门等等。专区和县正在修建工厂，其中有发电厂、榨油厂、榨糖厂、有色金属冶炼厂及制造机器的铁工厂等。我们已经制定了一个保证农村在五年内实现农田水利化、农业半机械化、农村电气化、肥料化学化的地方工业发展的五年规划。我们将把全部的力量拿出来，为五年内把落后的农村变为现代化的农村而奋斗。
