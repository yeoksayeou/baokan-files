Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd. Shanghai departments have exposed numerous instances of localism causing losses to state assets during the anti-waste struggle. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has called on all departments to combine the struggle against localism with specialized blooming and contending and specialized rectification in the anti-waste campaign, especially to oppose localism in cooperative relationships. It is necessary not only to expose the localism of one's own unit, but also to solicit opinions from relevant cooperative units; for losses caused to one's own unit due to the localism of other units, criticism and opinions should also be put forward to these units by means of presenting facts, reasoning, and using big-character posters to urge them to improve.

According to statistics from relevant departments, in 1956, due to poor coordination between various means of transportation and between transportation departments and materials departments in Shanghai, cargo trucks wasted a lot of time waiting to be loaded and unloaded, accounting for one-third of the total transportation time; the time wasted by barges waiting for loading and unloading, delays, and empty trips was equivalent to one thousand one hundred tons of barges ceasing navigation for one year.

The knitwear group of the Shanghai Textile Export Company purchased 23 tons of yellow cardboard in the name of manufacturing export shirt boxes when the supply of yellow cardboard in the domestic market was tight last year, causing the domestic market supply to become even tighter. However, for more than half a year, this knitwear group only used 5 tons of yellow cardboard, and 18 tons are still stored in the warehouse.

　　上海市委指示深入反浪费斗争
    一定要反掉本位主义
    据新华社上海3日电　上海各个部门在反浪费斗争中揭露出本位主义造成国家资财损失的大量事例。中共上海市委已号召各部门在反浪费的专题鸣放和专题整改中，结合进行反对本位主义的斗争，特别要反对协作关系中的本位主义。不仅要揭发本单位的本位主义，而且要征求有关协作单位对自己的意见；对因为其他单位的本位主义而造成本单位损失的，也应该用摆事实、讲道理、大字报等方法，向这些单位提出批评和意见，督促他们改进。
    据有关部门统计，1956年上海各种运输工具之间、运输部门与物资部门之间，因为协作不好，造成了货运汽车浪费很多待装待卸的时间，这些时间占了运输总时间的三分之一；驳船等待装卸、延期、放空等浪费的时间，也相当于一千一百吨驳船停止航行一年。
    上海纺织品出口公司针织品组，在去年国内市场黄版纸供应紧张时，以制造出口衬衫盒子的名义，购进黄版纸二十三吨，造成国内市场供应更加紧张。而半年多来，这个针织品组只用去黄版纸五吨，还有十八吨到现在仍存放在仓库里。
