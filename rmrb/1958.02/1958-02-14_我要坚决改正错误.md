Comrade Li Jieren said that when the rightists launched a frantic attack on the Party and socialism last year, he made some remarks unfavorable to the Party and socialism at the symposiums of the United Front Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. These remarks had a negative impact on the masses in Sichuan, especially in Chengdu. The fundamental reason for his mistake this time is that his position is still on the side of the bourgeoisie. He is willing to resolutely correct his mistakes, change his position, and earnestly play the role of a screw in building a socialist society in the remaining years of his life.

I fully agree with the reports made to the conference by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

Last spring and summer, when the bourgeois rightists took advantage of the Party's rectification campaign to launch a frantic attack on the Party and socialism, due to the trouble of my bourgeois ideology, my political boundaries were unclear, and I did not understand the major issues of right and wrong. Not only did I not foresee the reactionary nature of the rightists' words and deeds, but I also echoed them and made some remarks unfavorable to the Party and socialism at the symposiums of the United Front Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. These remarks had a negative impact on the masses in Sichuan Province, especially in Chengdu. Although I have made self-criticisms about these mistakes at the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress, the Chengdu Municipal People's Congress, and the Sichuan Provincial Literary and Art Circles Congress, they cannot be considered profound. After the help of many comrades inside and outside the Party, I realized that the emergence of my mistakes was by no means accidental, and it cannot be attributed to any objective reasons. In fact, it is because a fundamental problem has not been resolved, that is, although my country's revolution has changed from a bourgeois democratic nature to a socialist nature, my position is still on the side of the bourgeoisie. This is the fundamental reason for my mistake this time.

Upon examination, the formation of this position and its failure to undergo fundamental change have historical roots. I was born into a small-town family. In principle, although the petty bourgeoisie is not an exploiting class, it is most susceptible to accepting the views of the bourgeoisie, and under certain conditions, it is most likely to become a component of the bourgeoisie. I received education in feudal society since I was a child, and later, I was also deeply influenced by the culture, education, and political life of the Western European bourgeoisie. In China, I have long been among bourgeois intellectuals. At the same time, in the ten years before liberation, I also ran a national enterprise and possessed the status of a national industrial capitalist. Existence determines consciousness. Therefore, bourgeois ideology cannot but gradually form and be deeply hidden in my mind; the empty concepts of "democracy" and "freedom" consciously promoted by the bourgeoisie and its scholars cannot but affect my political views. During the bourgeois democratic revolution, on the one hand, I directly felt that imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism had conflicts of interest with national enterprises; on the other hand, I felt that Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship was opposed to any "democracy" and "freedom"; therefore, I deeply hated the social system and political structure at that time. Under such circumstances, I was able to accept the democratic revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party and the program put forward by the Party, and I placed my hope for transforming Chinese society on the Communist Party. After liberation, I failed to carefully conduct a class analysis of my above-mentioned position and political views. Of course, I could not clearly recognize that this position and political views, although had a progressive aspect in the democratic revolution, also had a negative aspect. By the time of the socialist revolution, this position and viewpoint could only hinder the development of society. Precisely because of this, I failed to consciously carry out ideological transformation after liberation. In addition, the previous movements since liberation did not involve me personally, allowing me to stay out of it. As a result, I not only failed to receive education from the previous movements, but also increased my estimation of my own progress. In fact, thinking carefully, it cannot be said that my understanding of the previous movements was completely consistent with the Party's requirements. Some movements belong to the category of democratic revolution, and the gap between my position and views is not large, so of course I have no objection. However, I had some different views on movements with a socialist revolutionary nature such as the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. Although the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns did not involve me, and I did not oppose the movement itself, in the early stages of the movement, I felt that some practices seemed "too fierce," so that I felt some incongruity in my thoughts and feelings. In fact, this feeling of "too fierce" reflected my suspicion of the movement, but it was expressed through suspicion of specific practices.

During the time when black clouds were covering the sky and evil winds were blowing last year, the mistakes I made and the root causes I have examined above are inevitably linked. First, when I saw the vicious cries of the rightist Ge Peiqi, I said at the symposium of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles: "His words are not worth taking, but his intentions are commendable." The implication was that Ge's attitude was indeed bad and his remarks were very murderous, so "his words are not worth taking," but he dared to say it "frankly," and this "intention" was commendable. Second, when the Sichuan Provincial Literary and Art Circles severely criticized "Grass and Trees," I thought it was "making a fuss over a minor issue" and that the author was young and ignorant. As for the author's deep-seated class hatred for socialism, I failed to smell it from his writings. These two errors exposed my bourgeois democratic views, because I regarded the rightists' remarks as a phenomenon in line with "democracy." In fact, this democratic view is precisely a reflection of the so-called supra-class democratic view that the bourgeoisie has always promoted. Third, my serious mistake was that when the Sichuan rightist Zhang Mosheng launched a frenzied attack on the responsible comrades of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Party group of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, not only did I fail to stand up and speak out for justice, but instead cited the rightist remarks at the time, saying that if there were any mistakes, the fault was not with the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, but with the Provincial Propaganda Department and the Central Propaganda Department. At that time, my initial intention was to relieve the responsible comrades of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, but I did not know that by doing so, I helped the rightists point the spearhead of the attack at the Party Central Committee. This mistake fully exposed that although I verbally accepted the slogan of "supporting the leadership of the Party and supporting socialism," in my heart, there was still a considerable distance from this slogan. Therefore, when the rightists attempted to seize the Party's leadership over literature and art this time, I unconsciously leaned to the right. When I made a self-criticism at the Chengdu Municipal People's Congress last year, I said that I had indeed "fallen into the rightist mire," which is what I meant.

Since the anti-rightist struggle, after several painful investigations, I have gradually understood that my bourgeois position and views are the root cause of my mistakes this time. However, at the beginning of the examination, I lacked an understanding of the seriousness of the mistakes, so the examination was inevitably superficial, and the investigation was inevitably superficial. With the help of the Party, I felt that a person with a bourgeois position and views, as the socialist revolution deepens, no matter how deeply hidden this position and viewpoint is, like unremoved grass roots, once the climate and soil are suitable, it will naturally sprout and grow, leading to major mistakes. "Uprooting grass must be thorough" is indeed a truth. Of course, it is undeniable that transforming oneself inevitably involves skin-cutting pain, but if one is determined to operate and cut, one will also feel great joy after the cut. This examination, although I have done my best, it seems that it is still not thorough enough. I hope that all representatives will give more advice. In short, from now on, I will definitely use the remaining years of my life to resolutely correct my mistakes, change my position, and earnestly play the role of a screw in building a socialist society.

### 我要坚决改正错误

    我要坚决改正错误
    李劼人代表说，去年右派分子向党向社会主义展开疯狂进攻的时候，他曾在四川省委统战部和四川省文联座谈会上发表了一些不利于党和社会主义的话，这些话在四川特别是在成都市群众中造成不良影响。这次犯错误的根本原因就是他的立场仍然站在资产阶级方面。他愿在今后以有生之年，坚决改正错误，转变立场，切实地起到建设社会主义社会的一个螺丝钉的作用。
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任向大会所作的各项报告。
    去年春夏之交，资产阶级右派分子趁党整风之机，向党向社会主义展开疯狂进攻的时候，由于我的资产阶级思想作祟，以致政治界限不清，大是大非不明，不但预感不出右派言行的反动实质，反而随声附和，在四川省委统战部和四川省文联的座谈会上发表了一些不利于党和不利于社会主义的话。这些话在四川省、特别在成都市的群众中曾造成不良影响。关于这些错误，我虽先后在四川省和成都市人代会上及四川省文艺界代表大会上作过自我检查，但都不能算深刻。后经党内外许多同志帮助，方才明确我的错误产生，绝非偶然，且也不能诿口于某种客观原因，实实在在是因为一个根本问题尚未解决之故，即我国革命虽已从资产阶级民主性质转变为社会主义性质，而我的立场却仍然站在资产阶级方面。这是我此次犯错误的根本原因。
    检查起来，这种立场之形成以及未能得到根本转变，是有其历史根源的。我出身于一个小市民家庭。按理说来，小资产阶级虽非剥削阶级，但最易接受资产阶级的观点，且在有条件时，也最易变成资产阶级的一个组成分子。我自幼曾在封建社会内受过教育，迨至后来，又曾身受过西欧资产阶级的文化教育和政治生活的影响。在国内，长期置身于资产阶级知识分子之间。同时，在解放前的十余年中，我又经办过一个民族企业，具备了民族工业资本家的身份。存在决定意识，因此，资产阶级思想意识也就不能不逐步形成，并深藏在我的思想深处；资产阶级及其学者有意识宣扬的“民主”“自由”等等空泛概念也就不能不影响于我的政治观。在资产阶级民主革命时期，一方面，我直接感到帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义与民族企业有利益上的冲突；一方面，则感到蒋介石的独裁统治与任何“民主”“自由”都是相对抗的；因此，我对于当时的社会制度和政治结构深恶而痛绝。在此种情况下，我对中国共产党领导的民主革命和党所提出来的纲领颇能接受，且把改造中国社会的希望寄予共产党。解放后，我对自己的上述立场和政治观点，未能仔细地进行阶级分析，当然，也就不能清楚地认识到这种立场和政治观点在民主革命中虽有其进步的一面，但也有其消极的一面。及至社会主义革命时期，这种立场和观点便只能起阻碍社会发展的作用了。正因如此，解放后我也就未能自觉地进行思想改造。加之解放以来历次运动均未牵涉到我个人，使我得以置身事外，从而我不仅未能从历次运动中得到教育，反而加重了对自己进步的估计。其实，细思起来，不能说我对于历次运动的认识都与党的要求完全一致。有些运动属于民主革命的范畴，与我的立场、观点差距不大，我当然没有异议。然而对于如“三反”“五反”这样的带有社会主义革命性质的运动却就有一些不同的看法了。“三反”“五反”虽也未牵涉到我，且我对于这个运动的本身也不反对，但在运动初期，我却觉得有些作法似乎“过猛”了，以至在思想感情上有一些格格不入之感。实则，这种“过猛”之感正体现了我对运动的怀疑，只不过通过对具体作法的怀疑表现出来罢了。
    在去年黑云满天、邪风四煽之时，我所犯的错误和我上面检查的根源是有必然联系的。其一，当我看到右派分子葛佩琦的恶毒叫嚣后，曾在文联座谈会上说：“其言不足取，其意却可嘉”。意思是说葛的态度的确恶劣，言论也十分杀气腾腾，所以，“其言不足取”，但他敢于“坦率”地说出来，这个“意”就可嘉了。其二，当四川省文艺界严正批判“草木篇”时，我却认为这是“小题大做”，并认为作者年轻无知。至于作者对社会主义的刻骨铭心的阶级仇恨，却未能从其文字中嗅出。这两点错误暴露了我的资产阶级民主观点，因为我把右派分子的言论也看成了合乎“民主”的现象，实实在在这种民主观点正是资产阶级一贯宣传的所谓超阶级的民主观的反映。其三，我的严重错误还在于：当四川省右派分子张默生向省文联负责同志和省文联党组猖狂进攻时，我不但未能挺身而出，仗义执言，反而引用了当时的右派言论，说如有错误，其咎不在省文联，而在省委宣传部和中央宣传部。当时我初意本欲为省文联负责同志解围，殊不知如此一来竟帮助了右派分子把进攻的矛头指向了党中央。这一错误十足地暴露了我尽管在口头上接受了“拥护党的领导，拥护社会主义”的口号，然而在思想底里，对于这个口号尚有相当距离。也因此故，在此次右派分子妄图夺取党对文艺的领导权时，我不知不觉地倒向了右边。去年我在成都市人代会上检查时，曾说自己确已“掉入右派泥坑”，即指此而言。
    反右斗争以来，经过数次痛苦的追根，才逐步弄清楚了我的资产阶级立场、观点实为此次犯错误的根源。但在检查之初，也曾由于对错误的严重性缺乏认识，因此检查不免肤浅，追根难免表面。后经党的帮助，方始感到一个具有资产阶级立场、观点的人，在社会主义革命进行愈益深入时，不管这种立场、观点平时如何深藏不露，譬如未经铲除的草根，一旦气候土壤适合了，它自然就会发芽滋长，铸成大错。“除草务尽”，的确有至理存焉。诚然，也不可讳言，改造自己有时也难免切肤之痛，但如下定决心，操刀以割，割后也会感到大欢喜。此次检查，我虽尽力之所及，但看来也还不能鞭辟入里，希望诸位代表多加指正。总之，今而后，我定以有生之年，坚决改正错误，转变立场，切实地起到建设社会主义社会的一个螺丝钉的作用。
