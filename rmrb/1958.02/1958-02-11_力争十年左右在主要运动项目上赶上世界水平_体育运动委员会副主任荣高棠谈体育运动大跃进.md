I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Comrade Wu Yuzhang. Now I would like to express some opinions on sports work.

In recent years, more and more people have participated in sports activities, new records have emerged constantly, national records have been broken 1,725 times, and three world records have been set.

In 1957, China achieved brilliant victories on all fronts. Under the care and leadership of the Party and the government, China's sports undertakings have adhered to the policy of developing mass sports activities, and have also shown a new look with the Great Leap Forward in national economic construction and cultural construction.

At present, whether in schools or factories, whether in cities or villages, more and more people are participating in sports activities. Through rectification and socialist debate, the development and activities of sports teams and exercise groups at the grassroots level have shown a new atmosphere that has never been seen in recent years. Since the beginning of winter, in many large and small cities, tens of thousands of students and workers have been practicing long-distance running or engaging in other sports activities on the roads or playgrounds every day before dawn. For example, in Jinan City, more than one-third of the young people have organized more than 900 long-distance running teams. In cities across the country, approximately over ten million people regularly participate in activities such as ball games, track and field, gymnastics, swimming, and skating. Through exercise, their physical fitness has been enhanced. For example, in the C shift of the spinning workshop of Liaoyang Textile Factory, out of a total of 106 workers, the attendance rate of the 58 who did not participate in sports activities from January to September last year was only 85%, while the attendance rate of the 48 who regularly persisted in sports exercise reached 98%, and 81% of them were rated as advanced producers. The Higher Party School of the Central Committee surveyed 225 students who regularly participated in sports exercise, and found that 67 of them had gained weight, ranging from one kilogram to six kilograms; 13 fat people lost weight and moved more lightly than before; 29 people had increased appetite; and 41 people slept well. One student in the ordinary class used to feel dizzy and have a headache after reading for a while, but now he can read for four or five hours at a stretch because he persists in practicing Taijiquan.

On the basis of mass sports activities, new forces in China's sports teams are constantly growing and technical levels are constantly improving. During the first five-year plan, Chinese athletes broke national records 1,725 times over the years, and in 1957, world records were set in weightlifting, swimming, and women's high jump. In particular, the women's high jumper Zheng Fengrong, with a score of 1.77 meters, broke the world record of 1.76 meters created by the American McDaniel, which shocked the world. This is not only the first world record in track and field created by Chinese athletes, but also the first world record in track and field created by Asia in 20 years. The Associated Press could not help but say in surprise: a 20-year-old Chinese girl in Beijing warned the world of track and field with a powerful jump that 600 million Chinese people will not always be backward players. It is still smart for Americans to realize this point. The Chinese people are unwilling to lag behind. The emergence of world records in our sports is another powerful proof of the great superiority of our socialist system. Under the close care and guidance of the Party, Chinese athletes will inevitably achieve more outstanding results in the future. Just as the Soviet artificial "moon" tells people: socialist countries, in all aspects, even starting from a relatively backward foundation, will definitely catch up with and surpass the most advanced capitalist countries at a very fast speed.

Developing mass sports activities is the fundamental policy of China's sports work. In the past, mass sports were viewed too narrowly, leading to a separation from the diverse projects loved by the broad masses.

The purpose of China's sports undertakings is to improve people's health, enhance people's physical fitness, and conduct communist education for the working people, so that the people's moral, intellectual, and physical education can be comprehensively developed, in order to better serve production and national defense. The fundamental policy of China's sports work is to develop mass sports activities. This is determined by the guiding ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the socialist system. It is under the guidance of this correct policy that China's sports movement has achieved widespread development. There are still many shortcomings in our work, and the implementation of this policy has not been smooth sailing. There are struggles between the socialist and capitalist roads in sports undertakings, as well as struggles between active and passive ideologies. Because of standing on two fundamentally different sides to look at problems, different conclusions will be drawn on the same thing. For example, in the process of universally promoting the Labor and Defense System in 1956, a gratifying phenomenon of the broad masses actively participating in exercise appeared across the country due to the opposition to conservative ideas. With this situation, some injuries also occurred in individual units due to the leadership not keeping up. In the eyes of the promoting faction, these problems are nothing. After improving the work and strengthening the leadership, they can be completely corrected and prevented. The superiority of the Labor and Defense System has been proven by the experience of our country in promoting the Labor and Defense System over the past few years, and it has also been proven by the experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, which is not allowed to be doubted. After recognizing the shortcomings in the work, we should continue to improve the work with a hundred times more confidence and full of energy. However, in the eyes of the hindering faction, this is completely another matter. They drew the wrong conclusion from the injury accidents that occurred in individual schools: that is, "the Labor and Defense System has been messed up," and even believed that no requirements should be put forward in sports activities. At that time, it did pour cold water on the masses and caused a period of ideological confusion. Right-wing elements also took the opportunity to stir up a gust of evil wind, causing undue losses to the work.

In sports work, there is another kind of negative factor, that is, some people lack a correct understanding of mass sports. They view mass sports very narrowly. Some people think that only radio gymnastics or the Labor and Defense System are mass sports, while various sports teams, exercise groups, sports competitions, cadre training, training athletes, etc., are all things that have nothing to do with mass sports. Therefore, when carrying out work, instead of carrying out various activities according to the different hobbies of the masses, they want to promote an activity in isolation, leaving the diverse projects loved by the broad masses. This kind of wrong approach will inevitably hit a wall. After they failed, they did not look for the reasons and learn lessons from them, but instead complained that "there are too many competitions" and "the Sports Commission only focuses on competitions and does not care about mass sports." It turns out that they also have an incorrect understanding of sports competitions. They oppose competitions and mass sports, and some people even say that advocating competitions and striving for victory is championism. This has become another topic for the right-wing to attack our sports undertakings. This is really off the mark. What is championism? It is championism to use unscrupulous means to win, and even to take immoral methods to win. If you use correct training methods to win, it is not championism at all, but a competitive spirit that should be greatly promoted. It should be recognized that one of the greatest characteristics of sports is competition. Competition is a working method of comparing heights and lows, comparing victory and defeat, and comparing progress and backwardness. It can promote the backward to move forward, and the advanced to move further forward; it can also attract more people to participate in sports exercise; it is for the purpose of improving and popularizing, and it is by no means just playing around. Competition is an important method for developing mass sports activities, enhancing physical fitness, and improving sports technical level. Shouldn't it be implemented not only in sports, but also in production or work? It is a method, not a purpose. The purpose of carrying out competitions is to attract and organize the broad masses to engage in sports activities regularly. With the improvement of technical level, comparison of victory, defeat, height, and low, helping each other, learning from each other, improving together, and constantly encouraging people to continue to exercise, take a step further. Recently, newspapers reported that some tricycle workers in Beijing became interested in watching football matches and organized their own teams. This is one of the good examples. As for things like working harder to train because you lost the game in order to win next time, or intensifying training because you want to win a higher ranking after winning, are even more common everywhere. At present, there are not too many competitions, but there is a need to organize more and better competitions, so that China's sports movement can continue to improve on the basis of popularization, and become more popular under the guidance and encouragement of improvement. Popularization and improvement are combined with each other and promote each other. Surging forward, so that the sports movement continues to leap forward.

In order to catch up with world standards in major sports in about ten years, it is necessary to deeply develop mass sports activities, and in accordance with the principle of developing sports undertakings diligently and thriftily, vigorously run amateur sports schools for young people and children.

Since the Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao put forward the great call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or more, the national industrial and agricultural production has entered a new upsurge, making China's socialist construction leap forward. Under this new situation, in order to better serve the cause of socialist construction, sports movement must also continue to leap forward. Strive to catch up with the world level in major sports in about ten years.

Ten years depends on three years, and three years depends on the first year. This year is a crucial year. The sports work in 1958 must be based on the spirit of doing more, faster, better, and more economically and building the country diligently and thriftily in various national tasks, and on the basis of the victorious development of work in 1957, resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, stir up revolutionary drive, continue to implement the policy of developing mass sports activities and accelerating the improvement of sports technical level, and strive for more sports projects to achieve or approach international standards, in order to change the current backward state of China's sports movement. In 1958, it is required to further strengthen grassroots work and vigorously develop grassroots sports activities; organize sports competitions more and better. In 1959, the first Chinese People's Sports Games will be held in Beijing to review the achievements of sports movement in the past ten years. This year's various tasks and sports competitions must be prepared around the 1959 National Games; a large number of young people and children athletes should be trained, and the work of strengthening the training of cadres should be strengthened; the leadership of rural sports work should be strengthened; socialist ideological education should be strengthened.

To make China's sports undertakings make a great leap forward in ten years, to enhance the people's physical fitness, and to improve the sports level, it is necessary to more deeply develop mass sports activities, especially to attach importance to the work of cultivating new forces. And vigorously running amateur sports schools for young people and children is one of the best ways to cultivate new forces under the principle of spending less money and doing more things. The fact that more than 18,000 young people and children athletes are being trained in the current 141 amateur sports schools for young people and children is proof. Their physical fitness has been enhanced, their sports technical level has been rapidly improved, and their schoolwork has also been well learned. For example, Kong Lingrong, a 17-year-old female high jumper in Beijing, won the second place in the country with a score of 1.54 meters; in Tianjin, 76% of the 690 students reached the standard of graded athletes after one year of training, and many people were rated as excellent students. This kind of school can not only quickly train excellent athletes, but also adapt to the current two-part system implemented in middle and primary schools, so that middle and primary school students can get good activity places. Therefore, schools like it, parents like it, and they themselves like it. It does not cost much money to run this kind of school, and no formal school site is needed. It is just to use the existing site and give them two to four hours of training per week in their spare time. We must start from the current generation of young people and children to strive to catch up with the world level in major sports in about ten years, and to improve and enhance the people's physical fitness. This is a major event related to socialist construction, national honor, and the health and happiness of future generations. We warmly expect all parties to value and support it. It is required that all stadiums, gymnasiums, sports colleges, sports departments and subjects of normal colleges, and all schools with better conditions actively run or jointly run amateur sports schools for young people and children. As long as we do this and work towards this direction, it is certain that we will be able to catch up with the world level, create world records, and change the physical fitness of the Chinese people! Zheng Fengrong, Chen Jingkai, and Qi Lieyun have already proved with facts that this is completely achievable. There will be more people in their next generation who will surpass them, and they must surpass one generation after another.

"Ride the long wind and break through thousands of miles of waves." At present, no matter the domestic or international situation, the care of the Party and the country for sports movement has brought a very good heroic wind to the sports undertakings, and the emergence of a large number of new forces on the sports field is even more like the back waves pushing the front waves. Our sports workers and athletes across the country must stir up the drive of the socialist revolution and make a great leap forward in China's sports undertakings by riding the wind and breaking the waves.

    力争十年左右在主要运动项目上赶上世界水平
    体育运动委员会副主任荣高棠谈体育运动大跃进
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章同志的报告。我现在谨就体育工作发表一些意见。
    几年来，参加体育活动的人越来越多，新纪录不断涌现，打破全国最高纪录一千七百二十五次，并出现三项世界纪录
    一九五七年，我国在各个战线上都取得了辉煌的胜利。我国体育事业在党和政府的关怀领导下，坚持执行开展群众性体育运动的方针，随着国家经济建设和文化建设的大步跃进也呈现了崭新的面貌。
    目前，无论是学校或工厂，无论是城市或农村，参加体育活动的人越来越多。各基层单位通过整风和社会主义大辩论，运动队和锻炼小组的发展和活动更出现了几年来从未有过的新气象。入冬以来，许多大小城市，每天天色微明，就有数以万计的学生和职工在马路或操场上练长跑或从事其他各项体育锻炼。如济南市有三分之一以上的青年，组织了九百多个长跑队。全国各城市，约有一千多万人经常参加球类、田径、体操、游泳、滑冰等项目的活动。通过锻炼，增强了体质。如辽阳纺织厂细纱车间丙班，共有一百零六名工人，去年一至九月，不参加体育活动的五十八人，出勤率只达百分之八十五，而经常坚持体育锻炼的四十八人，出勤率达到百分之九十八，并有百分之八十一的人被评为先进生产者。中共高级党校调查了经常参加体育锻炼的二百二十五名学员，有六十七人体重增加，少则一公斤，多则六公斤；有十三个胖子体重减少，行动比过去轻快了；二十九人食欲增强；四十一人睡眠良好。普通班一学员，过去看书稍久就头晕脑胀，由于坚持练太极拳，现在一气可以看书四、五小时。
    在群众性体育运动的基础上，我国运动队伍的新生力量不断生长，技术水平不断提高。在第一个五年期间，我国运动员历年打破了全国最高纪录一千七百二十五次，并在一九五七年出现了举重、游泳、女子跳高三项世界纪录。特别是女子跳高运动员郑凤荣，以一公尺点七七的成绩，打破了美国麦克丹尼尔创造的一公尺点七六的世界纪录，震动了全球。这不仅是我国运动员第一次创造的田径世界纪录，也是二十年来亚洲第一次创造的田径世界纪录。美联社也不能不吃惊地说：一位二十岁的中国姑娘在北京以有力的一跳警告世界田径界，六亿中国人不会永远是落后的选手了。美国人能认识到这一点总还算是聪明的，中国人是不甘落后的，我们在运动上出现世界纪录，这是我们社会主义制度的巨大优越性的又一个有力的证明。我国运动员在党的亲切关怀和教导下，今后还必然要出现更多优异的成绩。正像苏联的人造“月亮”所告诉人们的那样：社会主义国家在一切方面，即使从原来比较落后的基础上出发，也一定会以很快的速度赶上和超过最先进的资本主义国家。
    开展群众性体育运动是我国体育工作的根本方针，过去把群众体育看得很狭窄，以致脱离了广大群众喜爱的多种多样的项目
    我国体育事业的目的，是增进人民健康、增强人民体质，并且向劳动人民进行共产主义教育，使人民的德育、智育、体育得到全面发展，以便更好地为生产与国防服务。我国体育工作的根本方针是开展群众性的体育运动。这是马列主义指导思想和社会主义制度所确定的。正是在这个正确的方针指导下，我国体育运动获得了广泛的发展。我们的工作还有很多缺点，而且在执行这个方针的过程中，也不是风平浪静的，在体育事业上有社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，也有积极的和消极的两种思想的斗争。任何事物，由于站在两种根本不同的方面看问题，对同样事情，却会得出不同的结论。例如：一九五六年在普遍推行劳卫制的过程中，全国各地都曾由于反对保守思想而出现了广大群众积极参加锻炼的可喜现象，随着这种情况在个别单位因领导跟不上也产生了一些伤害事故。在促进派看来，这些问题算不得什么，经过改善工作和加强领导，就完全可以纠正和防止的。劳卫制的优越性，是由我国几年来推行劳卫制的经验所证明了的，也是苏联和各兄弟国家的经验所证明了的，决不容怀疑。认识了工作中的缺点，更应该继续信心百倍、干劲十足的去改进工作。但是在促退派看来，这就完全是另一回事。他们从个别学校发生的伤害事故中，得出了错误的结论：即“劳卫制搞糟了”，甚至认为在体育运动上不应该提出什么要求。当时确曾给群众泼了冷水，造成一度的思想混乱。右派分子也乘机煽起一阵阴风，使工作遭受不应有的损失。
    在体育工作中，还有另外一种消极因素，就是一些人对群众体育缺乏正确的了解，他们把群众体育看得很狭窄。有的认为只有广播体操或劳卫制才是群众体育，而各种运动队、锻炼小组，运动竞赛、干部训练，培养运动员等等，都是与群众体育无关的东西。因而在进行工作时，不是根据群众不同的爱好去开展多种多样的活动，而是脱离开广大群众所喜爱的多种多样的项目，想孤立地推行一项活动。这种错误做法，必然要碰壁。他们遭到失败以后，并没有去找寻原因，从中吸取教训，反而埋怨“竞赛搞多了”，“体委只抓竞赛，不管群众体育”。原来他们对运动竞赛也存在着不正确的了解，他们把竞赛和群众体育对立起来，甚至有人说提倡竞赛、争取胜利就是锦标主义。这又成了右派向我们的体育事业进攻的一个题目。这真是离题万里。什么是锦标主义呢？为了取胜而不择手段，甚至采取不道德的方法以取胜，这才是锦标主义。如果采用正确的锻炼方法以取得胜利，就完全不是什么锦标主义，而是大可提倡的一种竞赛精神。应该认识，体育运动的最大特点之一就是竞赛。竞赛是比高低、比胜负、以前进与落后的一种工作方法，它能推动落后的向前进，前进的更向前；它又能吸引更多的人参加体育锻炼；它为了提高也为了普及，决不是玩玩而已的事情。竞赛是开展群众性体育运动，增强体质，提高运动技术水平的重要方法。不仅在运动中应该实行，在生产或工作中不也都在实行吗？它是方法而不是目的。开展竞赛的目的是为了吸引和组织广大群众经常从事体育活动，随着技术水平的提高，胜、败、高、低的比较，互相帮助，互相学习，共同提高，不断鼓舞人们继续进行锻炼，百尺竿头再进一步。最近报纸上发表的北京市有一些三轮车工人因为看足球比赛发生兴趣，自己也组织起球队来。这就是很好的例证之一。至于因比赛输了而更加努力锻炼，以求下次获胜，或因胜利又想争取更高名次而加紧锻炼的事情，更是到处都有。目前，竞赛不是太多了，而是需要更多、更好地组织竞赛，使我国体育运动能在普及的基础上继续提高，在提高的指导和鼓舞下更加普及，普及和提高互相结合又互相推动。前涌后起，使体育运动不断向前跃进。
    为了在十年左右在主要运动项目上赶上世界水平，必须深入开展群众性体育运动，按照勤俭发展体育事业的原则，大力开办青少年业余体育学校
    自从党中央和毛主席提出在十五年或者更多一点的时间内，在我国钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面，赶上或者超过英国的伟大号召以后，全国工农业生产进入一个新的高潮，使我国社会主义建设跃进地向前发展。在这个新形势下，为了使体育运动更好地为社会主义建设事业服务，也必须不断跃进。力争十年左右在主要运动项目上，赶上世界水平。
    十年看三年，三年看头年，今年就是带关键性的一年。一九五八年的体育工作必须根据国家各项工作又多、又快、又好、又省和勤俭建国的精神，在一九五七年工作胜利发展的基础上，坚决克服右倾保守思想，鼓起革命干劲，继续贯彻开展群众性的体育运动和加速提高运动技术水平的方针，争取更多运动项目的成绩达到或接近国际水平，以改变我国目前体育运动仍然落后的状况。一九五八年要求进一步加强基层工作，大力开展基层体育活动；更多更好地组织体育运动竞赛。一九五九年将在北京举行第一届中国人民体育运动大会，检阅十年来体育运动的成果，今年的各项工作和运动竞赛都要围绕一九五九年全国运动大会进行准备；大量训练青、少年运动员、加强训练干部的工作；加强对农村体育工作的领导；加强社会主义思想教育。
    要使我国体育事业在十年内来个大跃进，使人民的体质增强，使运动水平提高，必须更深入地开展群众性的体育运动，尤其要重视培养新生力量的工作。而大力开办青、少年业余体育学校，是在少花钱多办事的原则下，培养新生力量的最好办法之一。目前在一百四十一所青、少年业余体育学校中培养着一万八千多名青、少年运动员就是明证。他们体质增强了，运动技术水平迅速提高了，功课也学好了。如北京十七岁的女子跳高运动员孔令蓉，以一公尺点五四的成绩获得全国第二；天津六百九十名学员，经过一年训练，有百分之七十六达到等级运动员标准，并有很多人被评为优秀生。这种学校，不仅能迅速培养优秀运动员，还能适应目前中、小学实施二部制，使中、小学生得到良好的活动场所。因此，学校喜欢、家长喜欢、本人也喜欢。办这种学校，不要花什么钱，也不要正规校址，就是利用现有场地，在课余时间每周给以二至四小时的训练就行了。我们要在十年左右争取主要运动项目赶上世界水平，改善和增强人民体质，必须从现在的青、少年一代着手。这是关系于社会主义建设、祖国荣誉和子孙万代健康和幸福的大事。我们热烈地期望各方面重视和支持。要求所有的体育场、馆、体育院校、师范学院体育系、科和一切条件较好的学校，都积极举办或联合举办青、少年业余体育学校。只要我们这样做，向这个方向努力，赶上世界水平，创造世界纪录，改变我国人民的体质是一定能够实现的！郑凤荣、陈镜开、戚烈云已用事实证明了这是完全可以做到的。在他们的下一代一定会有更多的人超过他们，而且必须一代超过一代。
    “乘长风破万里浪”。目前无论国内外形势，党和国家对体育运动的关怀，都给体育事业吹来了极好的雄风，而在运动场上大批新生力量的涌现，更是后浪推前浪。我们全国的体育工作者和运动员们，一定要鼓起社会主义革命干劲，乘风破浪地使我国体育事业也来个大跃进。
