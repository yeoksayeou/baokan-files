I completely agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang respectively.

In 1957, the rectification movement led by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, as well as the anti-Rightist struggle conducted within that movement, propelled all work forward, enabling our country to achieve great victories on all fronts, complete the great First Five-Year Plan, and fill everyone with confidence in our future. The delegates’ speeches fully expressed the astonishing great leap forward occurring across the country and the heroic spirit of the workers and peasants forging ahead, which is very exciting. The 1958 state budget and national economic plan embody the principle of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture, vigorously promoting the upsurge in agricultural production, and also implementing the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, building the country diligently and frugally. I believe that as long as we continue to rectify the three major styles of leadership in the ongoing rectification movement and arouse the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, a new atmosphere of making every effort to tap potential and oppose waste will emerge, and a new leap forward in the national economy in 1958 will be realized.

	Petroleum workers also need a great leap forward
	Actively explore resources and develop synthetic oil

I also fully support the policy of developing both natural petroleum and synthetic petroleum simultaneously. Compared with our other heavy industries, our petroleum industry is clearly too backward. As a petroleum worker, I am very ashamed, and we also need to strive for a great leap forward. The main reason for the backwardness of the petroleum industry is still that the resource problem has not been solved. Therefore, continuing to actively explore and develop natural petroleum is correct. However, for oil shale mines like Fushun and Maoming, the reserves are very large, they can be mined in the open air, and the cost is not higher than natural petroleum. Actively carrying out mining and building factories is very realistic and should be done. Places like Shanxi and Guizhou have coal, and coal is cheap. If we build small factories that gasify coal to synthesize oil, the cost of oil will be cheaper than transporting it from other places. The local areas are enthusiastic, and this should also be done.

I would also like to briefly talk about the oil and gas resources in Sichuan. The Sichuan Basin has superior conditions for the generation and accumulation of oil and gas, and the abundance of natural gas in Sichuan has also been confirmed. Natural gas is not only a cheap and high-quality fuel, but it can also be converted to synthesize oil, and can also be used as a raw material for manufacturing carbon black, synthetic ammonia, artificial plastics, and synthetic fibers. We should pay attention to the exploration and utilization of natural gas, and not let some people who are engaged in geological work in Sichuan say "Finding gas (without finding oil) is really discouraging." Besides, as long as the work is done, I think oil will also be found in Sichuan. We should carry out comprehensive exploration of oil and gas in Sichuan, on the one hand to expand natural gas sources, and on the other hand to find natural petroleum. Sichuan has convenient transportation and a large labor force. As long as we find more oil and gas resources, the development of Sichuan's oil and gas industry will definitely be rapid.

	Language reform concerns our six hundred million people
	Taking the path of pinyin is in line with the laws of language development

Now I would like to talk about language reform and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. Language reform is a major event that concerns our six hundred million people and future generations, so even though I am a layman in linguistics and philology, I would also like to talk about it.

First of all, the work of language reform also shows that it is impossible without the leadership of the Communist Party. Without a party that considers the interests of the masses, it would not advocate and promote language reform. Take the separation of language and writing caused by feudal rule over the past two thousand years, for example. Although the vernacular movement advocating consistency with the spoken language formed a climax during the May Fourth Movement, it was not until after liberation that the classical Chinese was fundamentally abolished, and Chinese characters were basically combined with the language. It is particularly worth mentioning that a language reform organization was immediately established not long after the country was liberated. The work of the past eight years has been both cautious and active, and has also implemented the Party's mass line, and the results are great.

Speaking of writing, we cannot but relate it to language. Language is the tool for expressing meaning and communicating socially through the sounds that are spoken and heard through each other's mouths and ears; and writing belongs to language. It can record language without being restricted by time and space. It can also be said that writing is the written form of language: then, obviously, the most suitable and natural form should be the phonetic form. It is precisely because phonetic writing is a form of writing that combines sound and form, learning and use are very easy, and a lot of time and energy can be saved. Therefore, phonetic writing is also the most efficient writing. The implementation of phonetic writing can make full use of modern mechanical technology related to writing and improve the efficiency of postal and telecommunications, typing, and publishing. Only phonetic writing can most easily keep up with the development of language, promote the development of language, and promote the closest combination of language and writing.

However, our Chinese characters are still in the semantic stage. Six or seven thousand commonly used characters have to be learned, one character has one form, and the form and pronunciation have no definite relationship. They are difficult to learn, difficult to recognize, difficult to write, difficult to remember, and difficult to use. Of course, Chinese characters have made indelible contributions in our cultural history, but they cannot adapt to the needs of the current great development of socialist construction in our country. After all, writing is a tool. If the tool is backward, of course it must be changed. From the perspective of the development law of writing, I think the only way to completely change it is to take the common phonetic path of world writing.

But then again, language reform is an arduous mass work, and we cannot do it by divorcing ourselves from reality. The goal of romanization cannot be achieved in a short period of time, and there must be a transition period in the middle.

	Simplifying Chinese characters is an indispensable first step
	All commonly used characters with many strokes should be simplified

The current tasks of language reform are to simplify Chinese characters, promote Putonghua, and formulate and promote the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. Its overall purpose is to enable more people to learn and use Chinese characters faster to improve their culture, and to gradually unify the spoken language of the Han nationality, so that our language and writing can better serve the socialist construction of our country.

In the absence of conditions for implementing romanization today, simplifying Chinese characters is an indispensable first step in language reform. Simplified characters are easy to learn and write, which meets the requirements of the masses. I also welcome it. Who doesn't want to save a little trouble? In fact, many simplified characters are the result of spontaneous reforms by the masses over the years for the convenience of writing. We are just taking the method of "conventional usage" and consciously using political power to unify and promote them. The work of simplifying Chinese characters must continue to be actively promoted. We cannot doubt or oppose simplifying Chinese characters just because some Chinese characters have been simplified or abolished insufficiently rationally (these characters can of course still be considered for modification). I think all the more commonly used characters with more complicated strokes should be simplified as soon as possible. We should also actively simplify radicals, because simplified radicals mostly come from commonly used running and cursive scripts, which are easy to recognize, and the simplification area is large, and the effect of reducing strokes is much greater than creating simplified characters one by one.

	Promoting Putonghua is the only way to have a common language. Everyone can understand Putonghua with pinyin alphabet

The Han Chinese languages ​​in various parts of our country, especially in terms of pronunciation, are very different. But now our country has achieved unprecedented unity and solidarity in history, and the people of the whole country are struggling for the common goal of building socialism. Linguistic communication is more extensive and frequent, which urgently requires a common language. On the other hand, more than 70% of the people who use Chinese speak Mandarin, so it is also correct to adopt Mandarin, which uses Beijing pronunciation as the standard sound and Northern dialects as the basic dialect, as the basis for further unification of Chinese. Promoting Putonghua is indeed a long-term mass work and an important political task. The standardization of Chinese should also be paid attention to. Putonghua is not only about pronunciation (although this is the main thing), but also includes vocabulary and grammar. I also believe that the promotion of Putonghua is also the most important prerequisite for phonetic writing. Only when Putonghua is basically popularized can everyone understand it when it is spelled out according to Putonghua using phonetic alphabets.

Finally, let's talk about the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. The main purpose of formulating and promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is to annotate Chinese characters, help teach Chinese characters and promote Putonghua. It is also a very important task of current language reform. The biggest advantage of this scheme is that it adopts the internationally used Latin alphabet form. The strokes are simple, easy to identify and connect, and it only uses 26 Latin letters without adding a new letter. It solves the 32 phonemes in Putonghua based on Beijing pronunciation very well, and the spelling is simple and clear: I think it is the best Chinese character annotation scheme, and I suggest that the conference approve it. But I have a small opinion on the names of the letters in the scheme: For the names of all phonetic alphabets, I think, in addition to using phonetic symbols, it is best to add the phonetic alphabet itself to annotate the pronunciation, for example, for the name of b, annotate bê, and so on.

Regarding the various uses of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, I fully agree with Director Wu's explanation. I would only like to add the following two thoughts and opinions:

(1) Even if we do not have phonetic writing, our Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme can at least be used for phonetic spelling, and it is still very useful. We can use the Chinese phonetic alphabet to translate foreign personal names, place names, and scientific and technological terms. This is really great for scientific and technical personnel because it eliminates all kinds of brain-racking things when translating with square Chinese characters.

(2) The Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme only decides on the letters to be used and stipulates the spelling rules. It is not equivalent to phonetic writing; but it can undertake the task of researching and experimenting with phonetic writing, and prepare for phonetic writing. Although phonetic writing cannot be implemented quickly, we must not be conservative or afraid of difficulties. We must actively work hard in many aspects, such as the issue of truly homophonous words that must be distinguished, the issue of word concatenation and typification, etc., and we must also formulate a formal phonetic writing scheme that conforms to national customs and Chinese characteristics through trial use.

Fellow delegates: Let us all be promoters in language reform work!

### 让普通话成为我们共同的语言  熊尚元代表的发言

专栏：

    让普通话成为我们共同的语言
    熊尚元代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任分别所作的报告。
    在一九五七年，中共中央和毛主席领导的整风运动以及在这个运动中进行的反右派斗争推动了一切工作，使我国在各个战线上取得了伟大的胜利，完成了伟大的第一个五年计划，也使每个人对于我们的未来充满了信心。代表们的发言就充分地表达了全国各地惊人的大跃进情况和工农群众乘风破浪的英雄气概，令人非常兴奋。一九五八年的国家预算和国民经济计划体现了在优先发展重工业的基础上工农业并举的方针，大力地促进了农业生产的高潮，也贯彻了增产节约、勤俭建国的精神。我相信，只要在继续整风运动中整掉领导的三大主义，鼓起群众的革命干劲，就会出现千方百计来挖潜力、反浪费的新气象，就会实现一九五八年国民经济的新跃进的。
    石油工作者也需要来个大跃进
    应积极勘探资源并发展人造油
    我对于发展天然石油和人造石油齐头并举的方针也完全拥护。我们的石油工业和其他重工业比，显然是太落后了，作为一个石油工作者是很惭愧的，我们也需要努力来一个大跃进。石油工业落后的主要原因仍然是资源问题没有解决；所以，继续积极进行天然石油的勘探、开采工作是正确的。但是，像抚顺、茂名的油母页岩矿，储量很大，又可露天开采，成本也并不比天然石油的高，积极进行开矿建厂是很现实的。应当搞。像山西、贵州都有煤，煤又便宜，如果搞从煤造气来合成油的小厂，油的成本比从外地运进去的也要便宜，地方上是积极的，也应当搞。
    我还想对四川的油、气资源简单地谈一下。四川盆地是具有油、气生成和聚集的优越条件的，四川天然气的丰富也是已经证实了的。天然气不但是一个价廉物美的燃料，也可以通过转化来合成油，还可以作为制造碳黑、合成氨、人造塑料、合成纤维的原料。我们应当重视天然气的勘探和利用，不要让一些在四川搞地质工作的人再说“找到气（没有找到油）真泄气”了。再说，只要工作作到了，四川的油我想也会找到的。我们应当对四川的油、气进行综合勘探，一方面扩大天然气源，一方面找天然石油。四川交通便利，人力又多，只要我们找到更多的油、气资源，四川油、气工业的发展肯定是会很快的。
    文字改革关系着我们六亿人民
    走拼音道路合乎文字发展规律
    现在我想再对文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案谈一谈。文字改革是关系到我们六亿人民和后代子孙的大事，所以，我虽然对语言学和文字学是门外汉，也很想来谈一谈。
    首先，从文字改革这件工作，也说明了没有共产党的领导是不行的，要没有一个为群众利益着想的党，就不会倡导、推行文字改革。就拿两千年来封建统治所造成的语言跟文字分家来说吧，虽然提倡跟口头语一致的白话文运动在五四运动时期形成了高潮，也还是到了解放后把文言文根本废除，汉字才跟语言基本上合起来。特别值得提出的是：在全国刚解放不久，一个文字改革的机构就立刻成立了，八年来的工作是既慎重而又积极的，也是贯彻了党的群众路线的，成绩是很大的。
    说到文字，就不能不联系到语言。语言是通过彼此的嘴和耳朵来说出和听到声音、用来表情达意、作为社会交际的工具的；而文字是从属于语言的，它可以不受时间空间的限制，把语言记录下来，也可以说，文字是语言的书面形式：那么，很明显地，最合适、最自然的形式应当是拼音形式。也正是因为拼音文字是音形合一的文字形式，学习和使用都很容易，可以节约很多的时间和精力，所以拼音文字又是最有效率的文字。实行拼音文字就能充分利用现代化有关文字的机械技术，提高邮电、打字、出版的效率。也只有拼音文字才最容易跟上语言的发展，并且推进语言的发展，促进语言和文字最密切的结合。
    但是，我们的汉字，却还停留在形义阶段，通用的字也得六、七千，一个字一个形，形体和发音又没有一定的关系，难学、难认、难写、难记、难用。当然，汉字在我们的文化史上是有过不可磨灭的功绩的，但是它不能适应现在我国社会主义建设大发展的需要了。文字究竟是工具，工具落后了，当然要改；从文字的发展规律来看，我认为，要彻底地改就只有走世界文字共同的拼音道路。
    话又说回来啦，文字改革是一个艰巨的群众性的工作，我们不能脱离实际来做，拼音化的目标更不是短时间所能达到的，中间一定要有一个过渡的时期。
    简化汉字是不可缺少的第一步
    所有常用而笔画多的字都应简化
    当前文字改革的任务就是简化汉字、推广普通话以及制定和推行汉语拼音方案。它总的目的也就是为了让更多的人们更快地学会和使用汉字来提高文化，并且把汉民族的口头语言逐渐地统一起来，使我们的语言和文字能更好地为我国的社会主义建设服务。
    在没有条件实行拼音化的今天，简化汉字是文字改革不可缺少的第一步。简字好学好写，是符合大众的要求的，我也欢迎它，谁不愿意省点儿事。事实上，有许多简字都是多少年来群众为了书写方便自发地改革的结果，我们只是采取“约定俗成”的办法，有意识地用政治力量来加以统一和推广罢了。汉字简化工作必须继续积极推进，不能因为某些汉字简化或者废除得不够合理（这些字当然还可考虑修改），就怀疑或者反对简化汉字。我认为，应当使所有比较常用的、笔画较繁的字都能尽快得到简化；还应当积极简化偏旁，因为简化的偏旁多半都从常用的行书草书而来，很容易认识，而且简化面大，减省笔画的效果比一个一个地创造简体字大得多。
    推广了普通话才有共同的语言  大家才能懂拼音字母的普通话
    我国各地汉族语言，特别是在语音方面，分歧是很大的。但是现在我国实现了历史上空前的统一和团结，全国人民都在为建设社会主义这个共同目标而奋斗，语言的交际是更广泛、更频繁了，这就迫切需要一个共同的语言。另一方面，使用汉语的百分之七十以上的人是说北方话的，所以，采用以北京语音为标准音、以北方话为基础方言的普通话作为汉语进一步统一的基础，也是正确的。推广普通话确实是一项长期的群众性的工作，也是一项重要的政治任务。汉语的规范化也应当引起注意，普通话不只是对语音讲（虽然这是主要的），也包括了词汇和语法。我还认为，普通话的推广也是拼音文字最主要的先决条件，只有普通话基本上普及了，用拼音字母按照普通话拼起来，大家才能懂。
    最后，再谈一谈汉语拼音方案。制定和推行汉语拼音方案，主要用来为汉字注音、帮助教学汉字和推广普通话，也是当前文字改革的一个很重要的任务。这个方案最大的优点是采用了国际通用的拉丁字母的形式，笔画简单，便于辨认和连写，而且只用了二十六个拉丁字母，没增加一个新字母，就很好地解决了以北京语音为标准的普通话里的三十二个音素，拼法又规定得简单、明确：我认为它是最好的汉字注音的方案，并且建议大会予以批准。但是我对方案中字母的名称有个小小的意见：所有拼音字母的名称，我认为，除了用注音字母外，最好都再加上用方案的拼音字母本身来注音，例如，b的名称，就注上bê，等等。
    对于汉语拼音方案的各种用处，我完全同意吴主任的说明，我只想补充下面两点感想和意见：
    （一）就算我们还没有拼音文字，我们的汉语拼音方案至少也可以拿来拼音，用处还是很多的。我们可以利用汉语拼音字母来翻译外国人名、地名和科学技术术语，这对于科学技术人员来说，减除了用方块汉字来翻译的种种伤脑筋的事，实在太好了。
    （二）汉语拼音方案只是对采用的字母作了决定，对拼音规则作了规定，并不等于拼音文字；但是它却能够担负起研究和试验拼音文字的任务，给拼音文字作好准备工作。虽然拼音文字不能很快就实行，但是我们也不能保守、怕难，还必须积极地在许多方面，如真正的同音词而又必须加以区分的问题，词儿的连写、定型问题等等，下研究工夫，而且必须通过试用，再拟定出合于民族习惯和汉语特点的拼音文字正式方案来。
    各位代表：让我们在文字改革工作方面，都来做一个促进派吧！
