Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th - Washington news: White House Press Secretary Hagerty announced on the 15th that US President Eisenhower's disarmament advisor, Stassen, formally submitted his resignation, and Eisenhower has accepted his request. In his letter of resignation to Eisenhower, Stassen stated that he was going to run for Governor of Pennsylvania.

Stassen's resignation confirms the sharp contradictions within the US ruling clique. Stassen has had serious differences with Secretary of State Dulles and Vice President Nixon for some time on disarmament policy and on relations with the Soviet Union, so these Republican power-holders demanded that Stassen be dismissed.

According to American newspapers, Stassen is one of the representatives of economic interests in the Morgan financial group in the eastern United States. He is related to a part of this consortium that can obtain considerable profits from trade with socialist countries or industrial forces that have less direct connections with the war industry. Stassen has disagreed with the Dulles faction on some major national policies. On the issue of disarmament, Stassen believes that Dulles's insistence on making the disarmament negotiations stalemate was "too inflexible." He demanded the formulation of new proposals, especially demanding that the United States agree to stop testing nuclear weapons and not tie this issue to other disarmament issues. On the issue of relations with the Soviet Union, Stassen also disagreed with Dulles's efforts to obstruct negotiations with the Soviet Union. He demanded that more careful consideration be given to the proposals put forward by Bulganin in a recent series of letters, especially the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

Stassen's resignation shows the failure of his faction's power. But news indicates that Stassen is still ambitious. If he can be elected Governor of Pennsylvania, he is likely to ask the Republican Party to nominate him as a presidential candidate in 1960, in which case he will become another strong rival of Nixon, who is very likely to be a Republican presidential candidate.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 17th - Washington news: Stassen, who just resigned as Eisenhower's disarmament advisor, said in a television program on the 16th that he advocated convening a meeting of heads of government including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. He believes that this meeting could be chaired by UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.

Stassen said he believes such a meeting offers hope to reach a "sound and guaranteed first-step disarmament agreement." He said that the meeting, of course, should not only discuss the issue of disarmament.

    华盛顿统治集团内部矛盾表面化
    美总统裁军顾问史塔生辞职
    史塔生建议召开苏波捷英美法六国会议
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂15日宣布，美国总统艾森豪威尔的裁军问题顾问史塔生正式提出辞职，艾森豪威尔已经接受了他的请求。史塔生在给艾森豪威尔的辞职信中表示要去竞选宾夕法尼亚州州长。
    史塔生的辞职证实了美国统治集团内部的尖锐矛盾。史塔生同国务卿杜勒斯与副总统尼克松若干时候以来在裁军政策上以及在同苏联的关系问题上存在着严重分歧，因此这些共和党的当权派要求把史塔生免职。
    据美国报刊报道，史塔生是美国东部的摩根财团中的经济利益的代表之一。他同这个财团中一部分能够从同社会主义国家的贸易中获得不少利润或者同战争工业的直接联系较少的工业势力是有关系的。史塔生在一些重大的国家政策上，都和杜勒斯一派有分歧。在裁军问题上，史塔生认为杜勒斯坚持使裁军谈判陷于僵局的态度“太不灵活”，他要求拟订新的建议，特别是要求美国同意停止试验核武器，不要把这个问题同其他裁军问题扯在一起。在对苏联关系问题上，史塔生也不赞成杜勒斯的竭力阻挠同苏联谈判的态度，他要求更慎重地对待布尔加宁在新近一系列的信件中提出的建议，特别是要慎重对待关于在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议。
    史塔生的辞职表明他这一派的势力的失败。但是消息指出，史塔生仍然是雄心勃勃的，如果他能够当选为宾夕法尼亚州州长，他很可能再次要求共和党提名他为1960年的总统候选人，这样一来，他又将成为另一个很可能是共和党的总统候选人的尼克松的劲敌。
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：刚辞去艾森豪威尔裁军顾问职位的史塔生16日在电视节目中说，他主张召开一个包括英国、美国、法国、苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的政府首脑会议，他认为，这个会议可以由联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德任会议主席。
    史塔生说，他认为这样一个会议提供希望来达成一个“健全的有保证的第一步裁军协定”。他说，会议当然不应当只讨论裁军问题。
