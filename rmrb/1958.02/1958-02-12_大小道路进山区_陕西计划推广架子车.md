Roads of All Sizes Enter the Mountains
Shaanxi Plans to Promote Pushcarts

    (Our Dispatch) In accordance with the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) that "special attention should be paid to the construction of mountain roads," this year, northern Shaanxi, southern Shaanxi, the Guanzhong Plateau, and semi-mountainous areas will mobilize the masses to newly build and repair tens of thousands of kilometers of pushcart roads, cart roads, pack animal trails, pedestrian roads, and simple highways connecting these roads. Among them, more than 10,000 kilometers of pushcart roads will be built, and hundreds of kilometers of simple highways will be built. The industrial sector will also supply farmers with 8,000 pushcarts this year. After these plans are realized, large and small roads will extend like veins to many agricultural production cooperatives in the mountainous areas, fundamentally changing the backward transportation situation in which people carry on their backs, shoulders, and animals carry loads, a situation that has existed for thousands of years among the people in the mountainous areas. Hundreds of thousands of laborers will be liberated from these heavy physical labors and投入农业生产.
    In this year's great leap forward in agricultural production, farmers in mountainous areas urgently need light and practical transportation tools. In the past few years, farmers in the mountainous areas of northern and southern Shaanxi have built thousands of miles of pushcart roads and bought nearly 10,000 pushcarts, developing the transportation of agricultural and sideline products in the mountainous areas, which has played a significant role in promoting production. In 1956, Wubu County promoted 150 pushcarts in more than 30 agricultural cooperatives along the highway, saving tens of thousands of workdays and more than 108,000 animal labor days in one year. After Suide, Qingjian, and other counties switched to pushcarts to transport coal, the freight per ton of coal was reduced by two or three yuan. In the past, in some areas of southern Shaanxi, many local specialties rotted because they could not be transported out. The promotion of pushcarts has basically changed this situation. Therefore, many farmers said: "Now that the roads are open, we want as many pushcarts as we can get." This year, farmers are very enthusiastic about developing mountain transportation. This year, thousands of agricultural cooperatives along the highway in northern Shaanxi plan to build three kilometers of pushcart roads each. Many agricultural cooperatives in southern Shaanxi plan to newly build and repair ten kilometers of pedestrian roads per cooperative this year.
    Pushcarts are light, practical, and inexpensive in mountainous areas, and most agricultural cooperatives can afford them. The problem now is that production cannot meet the demand. In addition, in order to make the pushcarts more suitable for going uphill and downhill in mountainous areas, the masses requested that a brake be added to the pushcarts; some technical guidance is needed for building roads up the mountains. At present, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Transportation is working to solve these problems. (Zhang)

    大小道路进山区
    陕西计划推广架子车
    本报讯　根据全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中“特别要注意山区道路的修建”的精神，今年陕北、陕南、关中高原和半山地区，将发动群众新修和整修几万公里架子车道、大车道、驮运道、人行大道和连系这些道路的简易公路。其中仅架子车道就要修一万多公里，简易公路修数百公里。工业部门今年也将供应农民八千辆架子车。这些计划实现以后，将使大小道路像脉络一样伸展到山区许多农业生产合作社去，使山区人民几千年来人背、人挑、牲口驮等落后运输状况基本上来一个改变。成千上万的劳动力将从这些笨重的体力劳动中解放出来，投入农业生产。
    在今年农业生产大跃进中，山区农民迫切需要轻便适用的运输工具。过去几年，陕北、陕南山区农民已经修了几千里架子车道，买回了近万辆架子车，开展山区农副业运输，对促进生产起了很大的作用。吴堡县1956年在沿公路的三十多个农业社推广了一百五十辆架子车，一年就节省了几万个劳动日，节省了十万零八千多个畜力劳动日。绥德、清涧等县改用架子车运煤以后，每吨煤降低运费两三元。陕南一些地方过去有许多土特产因运不出来而坏掉，推广架子车以后基本上改变了这种情况。因此，许多农民说：“路修通了，来多少架子车我们要多少。”今年农民发展山区交通的劲头很大。陕北沿公路的几千个农业社今年每个社准备修三公里架子车道。陕南许多农业社今年准备每社新修和整修人行道十公里。
    架子车在山区轻便适用，价钱也不贵，一般农业社都能买得起。现在的问题是生产供不上需要。另外，为了使架子车更适用于山地上坡下坡，群众要求在架子车上加一个闸；向山上修路，需要一些技术指导；现在，陕西省交通厅正在着手解决这些问题。　（张）
