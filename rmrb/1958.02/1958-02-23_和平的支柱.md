    Pillars of Peace
    Zhou Jiefu
    During our days in the Soviet Union, every time we passed a city that we had first heard of during the Great Patriotic War, I couldn't help but recall the scene from fourteen years ago. Back then, in a cave dwelling in Yan'an, we editors had maps of the Soviet-German war front hanging on the walls. Each day, we would fill in two or three small circles representing cities with red ink, and draw red lines between them. The major Soviet counter-offensives inspired us because they were closely linked to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the fate of humanity. Now, Tula, Kursk, and Kharkov, these familiar yet distant cities, were right before our eyes, welcoming us with all their splendor and prosperity, allowing us to see the rows of chimneys, the endless stream of transport vehicles, the bustling crowds, and the newly built and under-construction high-rise buildings. The vigorous construction had long swept away the traces of war.

    Wherever we went and whomever we met—workers, farmers, and intellectuals—nearly everyone over the age of thirty-two had fought against the German invaders. Some had defended Moscow, others had fought all the way to Berlin. The deputy director of the Zaporozhye Steel Plant, Yeus, had been a political instructor and battalion commissar, defending Stalingrad. His division earned the glorious title of Guards Division in that battle. Their division commander was never in the headquarters during combat but always with the soldiers. During the Battle of Kursk in May 1943, the German invaders launched relentless attacks for five whole days. The battlefield was surrounded by fire, making it impossible to distinguish between day and night. The soldiers took off their military uniforms and fired at the enemy in their undershirts. People had only one thought: to prevent the enemy from advancing! The enemy did not advance; they advanced! Although they sometimes got stuck in swamps or went without a piece of bread all day, nothing could stop their advance. Two years later, they liberated Prague and immediately went to annihilate the German invaders who refused to surrender. This unit did not officially celebrate victory until June. He couldn't count how many miles he had walked. Yeus said that if someone had told him before the war that he would walk so far, he would never have believed it.

    Zaporozhye was where we stayed the longest. It had been destroyed by the fascists, including the museum that recorded the city's history. A set of slides preserved in the office of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station told us that when it was first liberated, this world-famous hydroelectric station was only left with twisted iron frames and the base of the water gates. The city of Zaporozhye was liberated in October 1943, at which time the German invaders had already lit stoves in the trenches, preparing to spend the winter. The tidal wave of Soviet troops came so quickly that the enemy did not have time to destroy the base of the dam. An unknown hero cut the fuse that the enemy had hastily lit, but he himself fell on the dam. The set of historically significant slides also showed us the arduous scenes of reconstruction. Several photos showed Soviet officers and soldiers working alongside the people of Zaporozhye, picking up bricks, shoveling earth, carrying sand, and transporting mud, in order to quickly restore the paralyzed hydroelectric station. On the even more magnificent rebuilt dam spanning the Dnieper River, there was both the blood and the sweat of the Soviet army.

    The Soviet people deeply respected the defenders of their motherland. At train stations, in park squares, and even on remote hillsides, one could often see statues of soldiers holding submachine guns. Portraits of Matrosov were often hung alongside those of Zoya and Oleg in prominent places in parks. On the outskirts of Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, stood ten monuments to Soviet heroes. They were located on the banks of the beautiful Razdan River, with a hydroelectric power station whose red roofs were hidden among the green trees on one side and a newly built long bridge suspended in the air on the other. The names of the heroes were engraved on the monuments. In addition to Matrosov, Zoya, and Oleg, there were Armenians Avanti and Stepanian. The former was a Matrosov-like hero, and the latter was an air force captain who twice received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. He gloriously sacrificed himself after diving and igniting a large amount of gasoline in the German invaders' position. Each monument was equipped with a fountain, and the spring water flowed continuously day and night into the small pool below. The water was clear, sweet, and refreshing, and the phrase "lasting forever" was very appropriate here. The colors of the monuments were either red or purple, each different, made of a solid and viscous tuff rock, which perfectly represented the heroes' strong characters.

    These heroes had become the previous generation of figures in the Soviet army. They influenced and educated the next generation of soldiers with their combat spirit and combat experience. We happened to encounter a field exercise on a trip in Georgia. That day was Sunday, and the front was filled with rolling dust, with a series of trucks and artillery vehicles driving by. When they arrived at their destination, the young soldiers immediately jumped out of the vehicles to drag the cannons. The artillery that had arrived earlier had already lined up in the field, with several groups of artillerymen in their early twenties squatting behind the cannons, their dusty faces revealing seriousness, their eyes fixed on the front, quietly awaiting the commander's orders. At this time, the crops had already been put into storage, and the local specialties of tea and oranges had also been harvested. Most of the farm members stayed at home to decorate their houses and paint the doors and windows. This group of soldiers came to the field in the early winter morning to train and improve themselves. They defended the harvest, the borders, and world peace. The latter point was clearly demonstrated by the timely cessation of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt. No wonder that on the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, the passage of the powerful armed forces through the reviewing stand elicited such warm applause.

    That day, the reviewing stand next to Red Square was crowded with guests from various countries. On the reviewing stand where we were, there were journalists from Lebanon and Syria, and writers from Ceylon and Brazil. As soon as the parade began, they almost never stopped applauding. The neatly marching troops of the army, navy, air force, and border guards passed by like one person, and they applauded enthusiastically. Giant tanks and giant cannons rumbled past, and when the air was filled with smoke and dust for a while, they applauded furiously. When missiles, each larger than the last, and finally fish-shaped missiles more than twice the size of whales rolled past, they applauded desperately. Obviously, they understood the significance of the powerful Soviet army in defending world peace. The powerful existence of the Soviet army made peace-loving people rejoice and made the enemies of peace afraid. Not only was there the example of Hitler in the past, but today's Soviet army has taken a big step forward compared to a dozen years ago.

    和平的支柱
    周洁夫
    我们在苏联的日子里，每次，经过首次见面但早在卫国战争中闻名的城市，我不禁回想到十四年前的情景。那时候，在延安的一个窑洞里，我们几个编辑身边的墙上，都挂着苏德战争战场形势图，每天总要用红笔填满三两个代表城市的小圆圈，在红圈之间划上红线。苏军的大举反攻鼓舞着我们，因为它跟抗日战争的胜利、跟人类的命运紧相联系。现在，图拉、库尔斯克、哈尔科夫，这些熟悉而又生疏的城市就在眼前，以它的全部庄丽和繁华迎接我们，让我们看到林立的烟囱，无穷尽的运输汽车，匆忙地行走的人群，新建的和建筑中的高楼大厦。蓬勃的建设早已扫清战争的痕迹了。
    我们所到的地方，接触过的工人、农民和知识分子，凡是三十二岁以上的，差不多都跟德寇作过战。有的保卫过莫斯科，有的一直打到柏林。查波罗什炼钢厂副厂长叶乌斯当过指导员和营政委，保卫过斯大林格勒。他的师在这一战役中获得了近卫师的光荣称号。他们的师长，在战斗时总不在司令部，而是跟士兵们在一起。1943年5月举行的库尔斯克争夺战，整整五天，德寇不断地猛攻。阵地四围火光烛天，根本分不清白天黑夜，士兵们脱下军衣，穿着衬衣向敌人开火。人们只有一个想法：不让敌人前进！敌人没有前进，他们前进了！尽管有时陷进沼泽地，有时整天吃不上一块面包，都阻不止前进的脚步。两年之后，他们解放了布拉格，马上又去歼灭拒绝缴械的德寇，这支部队是在6月份才正式庆祝胜利的。他数不清自己到底走了多少路。叶乌斯说：如果战前有人告诉他要走这么多的路，他决不相信。
    查波罗什是我们住得较久的地方。它曾一度被法西斯所毁灭，包括记载了城市历史的博物馆在内。保存在德?伯水电站办公室里的一套幻灯照片告诉我们：刚解放的时候，这个世界闻名的水电站只剩下一些扭曲的铁架子和水闸的闸基。查波罗什市是1943年10月解放的，当时德寇已经在战壕里生起炉子，准备过冬。潮水般的苏军来得如此迅速，以致敌人来不及炸毁闸基。一位无名英雄割断了敌人仓促点燃的导火线，他本人却在闸上倒下了。那套富有历史意义的幻灯照片也使我们看到了重建时的艰苦景象。好几张照片显示出苏军军官和战士们跟查市人民一起，正在拣砖铲土，担沙挑泥，促使瘫痪的水电站赶快复原。重建后越发宏伟的横跨德?伯河的大水闸上，有苏军流过的血，也有苏军流过的汗。
    苏联人民非常尊敬祖国的保卫者，在车站上，公园的广场上，甚至荒僻的山坡上，经常能看到手拿转盘枪的军人雕像。马特洛索夫的画像常跟卓娅和奥列格并列地挂在公园里的显著地方。阿尔美尼亚首都挨里温郊区竖立着十座苏联英雄的纪念碑，它们位在风景美丽的拉兹丹河畔，一边是红屋顶掩映在绿树丛中的水力发电站，一边是高悬空中的新落成的长桥。碑上刻着英雄的名字，除了马特洛索夫、卓娅和奥列格之外，还有阿尔美尼亚人阿凡梯和斯捷潘仰，前者是马特洛索夫式的英雄，后者是两次荣获苏联英雄称号的空军大尉，他在俯冲和打燃了德寇阵地上的大量汽油后光荣牺牲。每座碑前都装置着喷泉，泉水日夜不断地流进底下的小池，水清味甘，冽心可口，“流芳百世”用在这里十分恰当。纪念碑的颜色或红或紫，各不一样，由一种坚固而带粘性的凝灰岩石作成，正好代表了英雄们强韧的性格。
    这些英雄们，在苏军中已成了前一辈的人物。他们以自己的战斗精神和战斗经验，影响着、教育着后一代的军人。我们曾在格鲁吉亚的一次路途上，偶然地碰上了一次野战演习。这天是星期日，前面扬尘滚滚，行驶着连串的卡车和炮车。它们来到目的地，年轻的战士们立刻跳下车来拖曳大炮。早到的大炮已在原野上列队摆开，炮后蹲踞着几群二十岁上下的炮手，风尘仆仆的脸上露出严肃，目光炯炯地注视前方，静待指挥员的口令。这时节庄稼早已进仓，当地的特产茶叶和桔子也收获完毕，农庄庄员们大都留在家里粉饰房屋，油漆门窗。这群战士却在初冬的早晨，到野外来锻炼和提高自己。他们保卫了丰收，保卫了边境，也保卫了世界和平。这后一点，从英法侵略埃及的战争及时被制止得到过明显的证明。无怪在十月革命四十周年那天，当强大的武装力量通过观礼台的时候，要引起如此热烈的欢迎了。
    那天，红场旁边的观礼台上挤满各国的来宾。我们所在的那座观礼台上，有来自黎巴嫩和叙利亚的新闻工作者，有来自锡兰和巴西的作家。检阅一开始，他们几乎没有停止过鼓掌。步伐整齐的陆、海、空军和边防军的队伍像一个人似地过来了，他们热烈地鼓掌；巨型的坦克，巨型的大炮隆隆震响地滚来，一时空中散满烟尘的时候，他们狂暴地鼓掌；一种大过一种的导弹和最后出现的比鲸鱼大过两倍的鱼形导弹滚过的时候，他们拚命地鼓掌。显然，他们理解强大的苏军对保卫世界和平的意义。苏军的强大存在使爱好和平的人们欣喜，使和平的敌人害怕：不但有希特勒的例子在前，而且今天的苏军又比十几年前跨进了一大步。
