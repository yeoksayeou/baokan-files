Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, Tunisian workers across the country responded to the call of the Tunisian General Labor Union and held a four-hour general strike starting at 2:00 PM on the 14th to mourn the victims of the Sakiet bombing. Large-scale mass demonstrations and parades were held in the capital and other cities to protest the French army's atrocities.

Approximately four thousand Tunisian employees working at French military bases also responded to the call of the union leadership before dawn on the 14th, leaving their posts and deciding not to work for the French until Franco-Tunisian relations are normalized.

On the same day, Tunisian President Bourguiba issued an appeal to the nation, calling on the people to "remain calm."

The Tunisian Information Department issued a communiqué on the same day stating that French armed forces had assembled on Algerian territory opposite the village of Sakiet. This force was equipped with four tanks, six half-track vehicles, and several artillery pieces.

According to an official announcement by the United Nations on the 14th, the Security Council will meet on the 18th to discuss Tunisia's complaint against France regarding the French bombing of the village of Sakiet-Sidi-Youssef.

The Asian-African Group at the United Nations stated on the 14th that the French bombing of the Tunisian village of Sakiet-Sidi-Youssef had "shocked world opinion."

The group held a two-and-a-half-hour meeting. After the meeting, Sri Lankan Ambassador R.S.S. Gunawardene, representing the group, issued a statement saying that the group expressed "confidence that the Security Council will take appropriate action in accordance with the United Nations Charter" and expressed "deep sympathy to the Tunisian people and government."

The Asian-African Group also established a seven-member committee to discuss the Algerian issue with Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.

News from Washington indicates that the United States is prepared to openly interfere in the Tunisian incident. State Department spokesman White said on the 13th that the United States expects France or Tunisia, or both, to request the United States to "mediate" the dispute between the two countries. On the same day, a senior U.S. official said that this mediation "is not mediation in the usual diplomatic sense."

U.S. State Department officials openly criticized the "harsh measures" taken by Tunisia for "complicating the situation." On the other hand, U.S. officials spoke in a threatening tone on the 14th: "If France does not want to encounter many unpleasant things in the United Nations Security Council," France must agree to allow other countries to conduct "mediation" or "good offices."

The "New York Times" published an editorial on the 14th, threatening Tunisia. The newspaper accused Tunisia of taking measures "without justification" after the French army's atrocities, and Tunisia's demand for the withdrawal of French troops "is also without basis." The newspaper also blamed the Tunisian government for mobilizing the masses and demanded that the State Department express concern about Bourguiba's actions.

French Foreign Minister Pineau addressed the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly on the 14th regarding Franco-Tunisian relations, emphasizing that France does not want any other country to mediate any disputes between France and Tunisia. Pineau said he was surprised when he heard talk of "mediation" by the United States. France has not asked the United States to do so.

On the one hand, Pineau expressed his willingness to negotiate with Tunisia and advocated the establishment of a Franco-Tunisian joint committee chaired by a third country to monitor the Tunisian-Algerian border; on the other hand, he reiterated that France cannot start negotiations under so-called "pressure," and that Tunisia must lift the blockade on French troops stationed in Tunisia. He revealed that France, despite the Tunisian government's ban, is using aircraft to deliver supplies to French troops stationed in Tunisia. He also stated that France does not intend to leave the Bizerte naval base.

Pineau hypocritically expressed "regret" for the deaths and injuries of Sakiet village residents who were bombed by French aircraft. But he once again attempted to confuse the right and wrong of the Sakiet bombing incident. He confirmed that France had decided to file a "complaint" against Tunisia with the United Nations Security Council. He also indicated that France is prepared to use its veto power when the Security Council discusses the issue.

On the same day, French Defense Minister Chaban-Delmas threatened that France was prepared to use force to change the current isolated situation of French troops in Tunisia.

    突尼斯全国总罢工抗议法军暴行
    美国扬言要出面“调停”法国表示不要“和事佬”
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：突尼斯全国职工响应突尼斯工人联合会的号召，在14日下午两点开始举行了四小时总罢工，向萨基埃特轰炸中的受害者致哀。首都和其他城市都举行了大规模的群众示威游行，抗议法军暴行。
    在法军基地中任职的大约四千名突尼斯雇员也在14日清晨之前全部响应工会领导机构的号召离开了自己的工作岗位，并且决定在突法关系正常化之前不管法国人工作。
    突尼斯总统布尔吉巴在同一天向全国发出呼吁，要求人民“保持镇定”。
    突尼斯情报部同一天发表公报说，法国武装部队已经在萨基埃特村对面的阿尔及利亚领土上集结。这批部队配备有坦克四辆，半履带式车辆六辆和大炮若干门。
    据联合国14日正式宣布，安全理事会将在18日开会，讨论突尼斯就法国轰炸萨基埃特—西迪—优素福村问题对法国提出的控告。
    联合国亚非集团14日说，法国轰炸突尼斯萨基埃特—西迪—优素福村的行动使得“世界舆论为之震惊”。
    这个集团举行了两个半小时的会议。锡兰大使拉·塞·塞·古纳瓦地尼会后代表这个集团发表声明说，这个集团表示“相信，安全理事会会根据联合国宪章采取适当的行动”，并且“对突尼斯人民和政府表示深切的同情”。
    亚非集团还成立了一个七人委员会来和秘书长哈马舍尔德讨论阿尔及利亚问题。
    来自华盛顿的消息表明，美国准备公开干涉突尼斯事件。国务院发言人怀特13日说，美国期望法国或突尼斯或者双方共同要求美国出面“调停”两国争端。同一天，一位美国高级官员说，这种调停“不是通常的外交意义的调停。”
    美国国务院官员公开指责突尼斯所采取的“严厉措施”使“局势复杂化”。另一方面美国官员14日又用威胁的口气说：“如果法国不希望在联合国安全理事会上碰到很多不愉快的事”，法国就必须答应别国来进行“调解”或“斡旋”。
    “纽约时报”14日发表社论，对突尼斯进行威胁。报纸指责突尼斯在法军暴行发生后采取的措施“是没有正当根据的”，突尼斯要求法国军队撤退“也是没有根据的”。报纸还责备突尼斯政府不该动员群众，并且要求国务院对布尔吉巴的行动表示忧虑。
    法国外交部长比诺14日在国民议会外交委员会就法突关系发表演说，强调法国不愿任何其他国家来居间调停法国和突尼斯之间的一切纠纷。比诺说，当他听到有关由美国进行“调解”的谈论时感到很惊奇。法国不曾要求美国这样做。
    一方面，比诺表示愿意同突尼斯谈判，并且主张成立一个由第三国担任主席的法突混合委员会来监督突尼斯—阿尔及利亚边境；另一方面，他又重申法国不能在所谓“压力”下开始谈判。而要突尼斯取消对法国驻军的封锁措施。他透露法国不顾突尼斯政府的禁令，正在用飞机向驻在突尼斯的法军运送供应品。他还表示，法国不打算离开比塞大海军基地。
    比诺假惺惺地对萨基埃特村居民被法机炸死、炸伤表示“遗憾”。但是他又一次企图混淆法机滥炸萨基埃特事件的是非。他证实，法国已经反咬一口地决定向联合国安全理事会对突尼斯提出
  “控诉”。他还表明，法国准备在安全理事会讨论这个问题时使用否决权。
    同一天，法国国防部长沙邦—戴尔马扬言法国准备通过武力来改变突尼斯境内法军目前的孤立处境。
