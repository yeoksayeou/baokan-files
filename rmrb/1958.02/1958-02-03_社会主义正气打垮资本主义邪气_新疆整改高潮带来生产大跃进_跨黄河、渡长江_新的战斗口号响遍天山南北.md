　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 2nd. Two upsurges, socialist education and production leap forward, have emerged in rural areas of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Currently, over 85% of the agricultural production cooperatives in the autonomous region have entered the stage of airing views, contending, rectification, and great debate. In the evenings, socialist education is conducted among farmers, and during the day, farmers are organized to build water conservancy projects and accumulate manure. Recently, the temperature has frequently dropped to below minus ten degrees Celsius, but large-scale rural production is still in full swing.

　　The rural areas of the autonomous region are mostly inhabited by farmers of ethnic minorities, mainly Uygur farmers. In addition, there are also Hui, Xibe, and some Kazakh, Mongolian, and Kirgiz people. Advanced agricultural cooperativization was achieved in rural areas throughout the region in the spring of last year. However, compared with agricultural cooperatives in the interior, the autonomous region's agricultural cooperatives have a shorter history, a weaker foundation, and more problems. The capitalist tendencies of wealthy middle peasants once ran rampant. Unlawful landlords and rich peasant elements took the opportunity to make trouble and undermine unity among ethnic groups.

　　The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the actual conditions in the rural areas of the autonomous region, decided at the propaganda work conference held in October last year that a universal socialist education and large-scale production movement should be carried out in the rural areas throughout the region from the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958. After November, local party committees and county committees successively convened expanded party committee meetings or three-level (four-level) cadre meetings to study issues related to launching the two major upsurges in rural areas. Subsequently, the autonomous region successively dispatched more than 2,700 cadres of various ethnic groups to various parts of southern and northern Xinjiang to assist counties in carrying out these two tasks in rural areas.

　　After the start of rural socialist education, farmers of all ethnic groups actively participated in this movement. The number of cooperative members participating in airing views and contending generally accounted for 80%-90% of all members. They expressed tens of thousands of opinions. Agricultural cooperatives adopted the method of rectifying while airing views and further encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers of all ethnic groups to air their views. Currently, most agricultural cooperatives have entered the stage of great debate. Based on the situation of airing views, the great debate is centered on cooperativization and combined with the issues of grain, counter-revolution suppression and compliance with national laws, urban-rural relations and worker-peasant relations, national unity and unity among ethnic groups.

　　In all areas that have undergone great airing of views, contending, rectification, and great debate on the two roads, the political and ideological outlook of farmers of all ethnic groups has undergone fundamental changes. The socialist righteousness in rural areas has risen, and capitalist evil has been severely struck. According to a survey of the Third District and Fifth Township of Aksu County, 114 Uygur farmers who originally requested to withdraw from the cooperative resolutely refused to withdraw after recognizing the major issues of right and wrong. They returned 115 livestock and 44 carts that they had taken away from the agricultural cooperative. The voices in the countryside clamoring that the grain ration standard was not enough to eat were no longer heard. Farmers of all ethnic groups throughout the region enthusiastically paid public grain, and the speed of grain entering the granary was reduced by one-third compared to the previous year. In the ethnic joint agricultural cooperatives in the Ili River Valley and Tacheng and other areas with mixed ethnic populations in northern Xinjiang, the unity among ethnic groups was also strengthened after airing views and debating. The spontaneous capitalist tendencies in rural areas were criticized; landlords, rich peasants, and other saboteurs engaged in illegal activities were attacked; and the political advantages of poor and lower-middle peasants were further consolidated. The cooperative members' confidence in running the cooperative has greatly increased. They said that now they "get up early to travel, and the more they work, the more energetic they become."

　　Driven and inspired by socialist education, an unprecedented water conservancy construction and manure accumulation movement involving thousands of troops and horses is also being carried out simultaneously in the vast rural areas of both the northern and southern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains. In this severe winter season, the area north of the Tianshan Mountains is already a silver world of frozen rivers and mountains. Even in the southern Tianshan Mountains, where the climate is relatively warm, the temperature often drops to around minus ten degrees Celsius, but the attendance rate of agricultural cooperatives in most areas is no less than 80%. In the Ili River Valley, a famous granary in Xinjiang, the winter busy season surpasses the past spring plowing and autumn harvest.

　　According to the original plan, the autonomous region will expand the irrigated area by 2 million mu this year and accumulate 48 billion jin of fertilizer. This plan is 70% more than the area of irrigation expanded in 1956, and the area of fertilization is also much larger. However, this plan was broken through when the mass movement came together. According to local plans, the expansion of irrigated area this year will reach 2.67 million mu, and there are currently 1,598 small and medium-sized water conservancy projects under construction, of which 1,123 have been completed, which can expand the irrigated area by 500,000 mu and improve the irrigated area by more than 870,000 mu. The three special districts of Hotan, Kashgar, and Aksu have the largest winter water conservancy projects, accounting for more than 90% of the total water conservancy projects in the region. Recently, the work of accumulating fertilizer has reversed the situation of lagging behind water conservancy projects. According to incomplete statistics, from October last year to mid-January this year, farmers of all ethnic groups have accumulated more than 14.844 billion jin of fertilizer, completing one-third of the plan. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in Bachu County and Shanshan County has reached an average of more than 7,500 jin and 5,700 jin of fertilizer per mu, respectively.

　　Not long ago, people were still skeptical about whether the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region could "cross the Yellow River." Now "crossing the Yellow River and crossing the Yangtze River" has become a new battle cry in rural areas. According to understanding, there are now five agricultural cooperatives that will cross the Yangtze River in terms of grain yield this year, with a grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu. The grain yield of Miquan, Changji, and Bachu counties is planned to exceed 400 jin this year. Cotton-producing counties such as Turpan, Shanshan, Toksun, Bachu, Makit, and Kuqa have all decided to produce an average of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year.

　　The problem that deserves attention at present is that in the production movement in various parts of the autonomous region, some areas are slow to act, and some areas are still dead ends. For example, by the end of January, only nine water conservancy projects had been built in Tacheng Prefecture, and Tacheng County in this prefecture only plans to start water conservancy construction in February. The water conservancy work of the Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture is currently still in the planning stage. Aksu Prefecture also does not pay enough attention to fertilizer accumulation, and by mid-January, only 6% of the planned fertilizer had been accumulated. The reasons for this situation, in addition to the objective reasons such as the heavy snow in some areas of northern Xinjiang in winter, which makes construction difficult, are mainly that the leaders in these areas have not paid enough attention, are poorly prepared, and cannot produce planning materials for water conservancy construction at once.

　　The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China recently inspected the socialist education and large-scale production work in rural areas throughout the region and believes that after socialist education in rural areas of the autonomous region, winter production is better than in any previous year. However, compared with the actual requirements of the great leap forward in production this year, it is still far from enough. Therefore, it requires party committees at all levels to seriously pay attention to the unbalanced development of the movement and the lack of enthusiasm in some areas. It requires sending people to inspect, strengthen leadership, mobilize the masses more deeply and extensively, do a good job in the two major upsurges, and strive for a great leap forward and a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

### 社会主义正气打垮资本主义邪气  新疆整改高潮带来生产大跃进  “跨黄河、渡长江”新的战斗口号响遍天山南北

　　社会主义正气打垮资本主义邪气
    新疆整改高潮带来生产大跃进
    “跨黄河、渡长江”新的战斗口号响遍天山南北
    新华社乌鲁木齐2日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各地农村的社会主义教育和生产跃进两个高潮已经出现。目前，自治区85％以上的农业生产合作社已分别进入大鸣、大放，整改和大辩论的阶段。各地晚上在农民中进行社会主义教育，白天组织农民兴修水利和积肥。最近气温经常降低到零下十度，农村大生产依然热火朝天。
    自治区农村绝大部分是少数民族农民，其中主要是维吾尔族农民。此外还有回族、锡伯族和一部分哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克孜族人。各地农村在去年春季实现了高级农业合作化。但是，与内地农业社比较，自治区的农业社历史短、基础差，存在问题也较多。富裕中农的资本主义倾向曾一度泛滥。一些地区的不法地主、富农分子乘机捣乱，破坏民族之间的团结。
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会根据党的八届三中全会精神和自治区农村实际情况，在去年10月召开的宣传工作会议上决定：1957年冬到1958年春天，在全区农村中普遍开展一次社会主义教育和大生产运动。11月以后，各地委、县委陆续召开了党委扩大会议或三级（四级）干部会议，研究在农村掀起两大高潮有关问题。接着，自治区先后抽调出两千七百多名各民族干部分赴南疆北疆各地，协助各县在农村开展这两项工作。
    农村社会主义教育开始后，各民族农民都积极参加了这一运动。参加鸣放的社员大都占到全体社员80％—90％。他们发表了成千上万条意见。各农业社采取了边整边改的办法，更加鼓舞了各民族农民鸣放积极性。现在，多数农业社已进入大辩论的阶段。根据鸣放情况，大辩论是以合作化为中心，结合粮食问题、肃反和遵守国家法制、城乡关系和工农关系、祖国的统一和各民族之间的团结问题来进行的。
    凡是经过大鸣大放、整改和两条道路大辩论的地区，各族农民政治思想面貌已经起了根本的变化。农村社会主义正气上升，资本主义邪气受到了严重的打击。根据阿克苏县三区五乡的调查，原来有一百十四户要求退社的维吾尔族农民，在认清大是大非以后坚决不退社了，他们退还了原来他们拉走的农业社一百十五头牲畜，四十四辆大车。农村中叫喊留粮标准不够吃的声音听不见了。全区各族农民踊跃缴纳公粮，粮食入仓速度比上一年缩短了三分之一时间。在新疆北部伊犁河谷和塔城等民族杂居地区的民族联合农业社内，鸣放辩论后，各民族之间的团结也加强了。农村中资本主义自发倾向受到了批判；从事非法活动的地主、富农和其他破坏分子受到了打击；贫农和下中农的政治优势更加巩固。社员们办社信心大大提高了，他们说现在是：“鸡叫赶路，越干越有劲”。
    在社会主义教育的推动和鼓舞下，一个史无前例的千军万马般的兴修水利和积肥运动也在天山南北广大农村同时开展起来。在这隆冬的季节里，天山以北早已是千里冰封的银色世界，即使气候较暖的天山南部地区，气温也经常降低到摄氏零下十度左右，但多数地区农业社的出勤率不下于80％，新疆著名粮仓伊犁河谷地带，冬忙赛过了过去的春播和秋收。
    根据原来计划，自治区今年要扩大灌溉面积二百万亩，积肥四百八十亿斤。这个计划比1956年扩大的灌溉面积要多70％，施肥面积也大得多。但这个计划，当群众性的运动一起来，就被突破了。根据各地计划，今年扩大灌溉面积将达到二百六十七万亩，目前正在动工的中小型水利工程已有一千五百九十八项，其中完工的有一千一百二十三项，可以扩大灌溉面积五十万亩，改善灌溉面积八十七万多亩。和阗、喀什、阿克苏三个专区冬修水利工程最大，占全区水利工程总数的90％以上。最近以来，积肥工作已经扭转了落后于水利工程的局面。据不完全统计，从去年10月到今年1月中旬，各族农民积肥已达一百四十八亿四千多万斤，完成计划的三分之一。巴楚县、鄯善县所积的肥料，已分别达到每亩平均可施肥七千五百多斤和五千七百多斤的水平。
    不久以前，人们对于新疆维吾尔自治区能否“跨黄河”还抱有怀疑。现在“跨黄河、渡长江”已成为农村新的战斗口号。根据了解，现在已有五个农业社今年粮食产量要渡过长江，每亩产粮一千斤。米泉、昌吉、巴楚三县的粮食产量今年计划超过四百斤。吐鲁番、鄯善、托克逊、巴楚、麦盖提、库车等棉产县，今年都决定平均每亩要产皮棉百斤。
    目前值得注意的问题是自治区各地在生产运动中，有些地区行动迟缓，有些地区还是死角。例如，塔城专区到1月底修建的水利工程还只有九项，而这个专区的塔城县目前只打算到2月份才开始兴修水利。博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州的水利工作目前还在做计划。阿克苏专区对于积肥也重视不够，到1月中旬所积的肥料还只有计划的6％。产生这种情况的原因，除了北疆有些地区因冬季雪大，难以施工等客观原因外，主要是这些地区的领导上注意不够，准备得差，一下拿不出兴修水利的规划资料。
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会最近检查了一次全区农村社会主义教育和大生产的工作，认为自治区农村在进行了社会主义教育以后，冬季生产比过去任何一年都要好。但是和今年生产大跃进的实际要求比较，还差得很远。因此，要求各地党委严肃注意运动发展不平衡状态和部分地区劲头不大的情绪。要求派人检查、加强领导，更深入更广泛地发动群众，搞好两大高潮，争取今年农业生产上的大跃进和大丰收。
