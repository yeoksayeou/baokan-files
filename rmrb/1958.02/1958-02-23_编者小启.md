Editor's Note:
    Today is the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Red Army. Today is also the day Comrade Yang Jingyu is laid to rest. We have published some commemorative poems, articles, and paintings. The articles on family life, etc., originally scheduled to be published today (Sunday), will be moved to tomorrow's supplement.
