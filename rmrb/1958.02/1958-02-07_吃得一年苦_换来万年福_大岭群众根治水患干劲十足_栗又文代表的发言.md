I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 state budget and the draft 1958 state budget, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft 1958 national economic plan, Director Wu Yuzhang's report on the current work of language reform and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

I would now like to give a brief speech to the assembly on the situation of winter water conservancy construction in Jilin Province, taking Daling District in Huai County as an example. Because the situation in the whole province has not been well summarized, there is no outstanding experience to speak of, but only to illustrate that water conservancy can be constructed in the harsh conditions of winter. Moreover, as long as the masses are mobilized and their enthusiasm is aroused, there will be no difficulties that cannot be overcome. This enthusiasm is the reliable guarantee for our province to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule.

More than a Million Men and Women in Jilin Province Take to the Battlefield Every Day, Competing to Struggle Against Nature

Jilin Province originally had many favorable conditions for developing agricultural production, but during the first five-year plan period, it experienced "three disasters and two average years," without a single bumper harvest. The most important reason for this was that water management was not done well, and water hazards were not turned into water conservancy. The prominent manifestation was the insufficient understanding and ineffective measures for controlling waterlogging. As a result, during the first five-year plan period, the average annual area affected by water disasters, converted into areas with no harvest, reached 6.75 million mu, accounting for 9.78% of the total cultivated land in the province. Among them, areas affected by waterlogging accounted for more than 60% of the total area affected by water disasters. This has become the key to our failure to complete grain production tasks for years in a row. If this problem cannot be solved, the situation of agricultural production will not improve, let alone leap forward development.

Since September 1957, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the "Instructions on Launching Large-Scale Farmland Water Conservancy Construction and Manure Accumulation Movement in the Winter of This Year and Spring of Next Year," our province, like other parts of the country, has witnessed an unprecedented mass agricultural production upsurge centered on water conservancy and manure accumulation. It is breaking through all right-leaning conservative obstacles with an overwhelming force and developing in a broader and deeper direction. At present, approximately 1.2 million male and female laborers in the province are fighting against nature in the frozen and snowy ground with unparalleled enthusiasm. There has been a great leap forward in water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, and sideline production. According to statistics on January 15th, the province has completed 9,199 water conservancy projects, which can expand the irrigated area by 968,745 mu. There are still 13,958 water conservancy projects under construction, which can expand the irrigated area by 743,640 mu after completion. The total of the above two items can expand the irrigated area by 1,712,385 mu, exceeding the original provincial plan by 14.16%. Some counties have completed projects exceeding the provincial plan target by 30% to 100%. The province will greatly exceed the original plan target. The mass waterlogging control projects have completed 2,838,085 mu, exceeding the provincial plan target by 38.22%. Some counties have exceeded the provincial plan target by 100% to 200%. The vast number of farmers in the province are fighting bravely towards the goal of completing 3.75 million mu of waterlogging control projects this winter under the slogan of "Striving to Eliminate Waterlogging in Two Years" (originally set for seven years).

The actual actions of the masses for more than three months have given us a profound lesson, and at the same time, dispelled many superstitions. At the water conservancy work conference held in our province last autumn, some people believed that "the province's plan is too high and difficult to achieve." In fact, as soon as the masses started to act, the original plan target of the province was broken through. In many areas, the plan was revised several times and broken through several times. We have also repeatedly criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, but in reality, we are still lagging behind the development of the situation. This fully shows that we have underestimated the power and wisdom of the masses in the past. In the coldest "third nine days" in Northeast China, the vast number of masses are still struggling hard in the severe cold with unparalleled enthusiasm. In order to prevent the soil from freezing, many construction sites try to work day and night. At night, campfires or lanterns can be seen shining everywhere on the construction sites. The masses put forward heroic slogans such as "Not afraid of the wind, not afraid of the cold, finish the project before the New Year" and "Greed for the dark, get up early, follow the moon."

In the past, when it came to water conservancy projects, the first problems encountered were time and labor. Many people believed that the season suitable for construction was also the busy farming season. Winter had more time, but it was not conducive to construction, and even if construction was forced, the quality of the project could not be guaranteed. The large-scale waterlogging control project in Daling District, Huai County, broke this superstition.

Daling Area Suffers from Low-Lying Terrain and Water Disasters Year After Year - Lacked a Complete Water Management Plan in the Past

The Daling area is 12 kilometers wide from east to west and 40 kilometers long from north to south. The district includes 26 townships, 42 agricultural cooperatives, 15,000 households, and 65,363 people. The actual cultivated land area is 773,645 mu, of which more than 390,000 mu are waterlogged land. The soil in this area is generally fertile, mostly black clay, which is suitable for the growth of various crops. However, due to the low-lying terrain, it is often threatened by internal and external water. From 1953 to 1956, the accumulated area of breached embankments and flooded land reached 200,532 mu, and the area of waterlogging reached 750,000 mu, resulting in a total reduction of 48,168 tons of grain. In order to provide relief and support to the disaster victims to restore production, the state has distributed more than 460,000 yuan in relief funds and more than 1.35 million yuan in loans over the years. The disaster situation in 1956 was the most serious. Only 30% of the total cultivated land was harvested, and 390,000 mu of low-lying land had no harvest. In this year alone, 4,480 tons of grain were transferred in. "Repairing embankments in spring, preventing floods in summer, and providing disaster relief in autumn and winter" has become an important and frequent central task in this area.

As the saying goes, "Not afraid of a lean year, just afraid of successive years." This area has suffered from water disasters for several consecutive years, and the soil alkalization is serious. Some cultivated land has become ponds. Commune members used ballads to describe the perennially waterlogged depressions, saying: "Beat mandarin ducks with sticks and scoop fish with ladles, wild chickens fly into the rice pot." Due to the continuous reduction in grain production, the living standards of the masses have also declined year by year, and their production morale is very unstable. More than 1,300 households in the district requested to move, and more than 300 households in Changlong Cooperative wanted to leave, accounting for 40% of the total number of households in the cooperative. Their popular saying is: "If you want to be poor, live in Changlong; if you want to get rich, live in Cui's house" (Changlong is low-lying, Cui's house is high), "Trees die when moved, people live when moved," "People go to high places, and birds fly to bright places." It was precisely because of this situation that some grass-roots cadres lost their confidence. The leading cadres of Huai County had proposed many solutions for this area and taken some measures, but there was still no complete plan on how to manage it. Finally, they consulted the masses. They went to the countryside separately, inspected and visited farmers everywhere, and invited more than 500 old farmers to talk and discuss with grass-roots cadres, listening to their criticisms and suggestions. Some old farmers said: "Just draining water is not enough. To manage water, we must store water. We must sacrifice small pieces of land to save large pieces of land. We cannot let mountain water enter the depressions." Based on the collected information and the suggestions of the masses, and conducting actual inspections to understand the situation, the county, with the help of the water conservancy department, determined the principle of focusing on waterlogging control, combined with farmland water conservancy construction, and giving equal importance to storage and drainage, with storage as the main focus.

Visiting the Masses, Consulting Old Farmers, and Making Plans - Decided to Launch a Winter Construction Upsurge

After the principle was determined, surveying and mapping were carried out. At the same time, cadres went deep into the masses, visited every household, and solicited opinions. The masses gratefully said: "This is to bring us benefits." Some elderly people said: "The government is helping to build water conservancy. I will work hard even if I have to risk my old life." Some families closer to the construction site expressed one after another: "I have no objection to digging to the center of my courtyard in the future. If the house is blocking the way, I will move. As long as the water is managed, it is better than anything else." This was not only a great encouragement to the masses, but also a profound understanding of the urgent need of the masses for waterlogging control, which further strengthened the confidence of the leadership. However, in the process of preparing for winter construction, some new concerns emerged. The conservative thinking of the grass-roots cadres had not been completely eliminated. They were afraid that the work would not be effective and they would be blamed by the masses. They were also afraid that if the local township built it, the upstream would not build it and they would still suffer disasters. There was a widespread belief that winter construction was slow, costly, and ineffective. In response to this situation, the leading comrades of Huai County, on the one hand, organized cadres to study the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and the central government's instructions on launching a water conservancy construction upsurge, launched debates, improved understanding, and broke through concerns. On the other hand, they helped the masses to calculate four accounts: first, calculate the loss of production account, explaining that life cannot be improved without waterlogging control; second, calculate the future outlet account, reversing pessimistic emotions; third, calculate the long-term account, pointing out the beautiful future of building water conservancy; fourth, calculate the work and labor account, proving that this project can be completed. After the "four calculations," the concerns of the masses were dispelled, confidence was enhanced, and enthusiasm was aroused, launching a winter construction upsurge.

To Achieve a Network of Ditches and Ponds, Turning Waterlogged Land into Granaries - Snow Three Feet Deep and Frozen Ground Five Feet Deep Cannot Stop People

According to their plan, the entire district's waterlogging control takes three steps. The first step is to build control projects such as flood storage areas and interception ditches to solve the past situation of simply draining water, which instead caused flooding. The second step is to build drainage projects such as main ditches, branch ditches, collecting ditches, and cutoff ditches, as well as field projects. The third step is to use reservoirs to vigorously develop fish farming, duck raising, planting reeds, water chestnuts, and gorgon fruit, to achieve comprehensive utilization and all-round development.

As of January 17, when I arrived in Daling, they had completed nine flood storage areas, thirty-seven main ditches, six interception ditches, ninety branch ditches, thirteen embankments, eight culverts, five large pits, and six bridges, totaling 623,500 cubic meters of earthwork. The first and second steps of the project have been basically completed, with only a small portion of drainage projects and field projects unfinished. At that time, it was the coldest time in Northeast China, with snow three feet deep and frozen ground five feet deep, but the enthusiasm of the masses was very high. They were actively digging ditches on the frozen ground like stone. It is expected that the third step of the project can also be completed this year, and it will be effective in the same year. It is estimated that it can increase grain production by at least 20,000 tons compared with 1957. It is not a miracle that a disaster-stricken area for many years can be completely transformed in one year. It is due to the call of the Party and the enthusiasm of the masses. After all the above plans are realized, the total income of the entire district can reach more than 5.12 million yuan, with an average of more than 78 yuan per person. Therefore, the masses happily said: "In 1958 and 1959, we can catch up with the level of prosperous middle peasants."

For this area's project, only the flood storage area and the main ditches are the responsibility of the technicians of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau. The general projects are led by district and township cadres, and the field projects are completely done by the cooperatives themselves. This not only solves the difficulty of insufficient technical force, but also cultivates a group of peasant technicians. The projects built by the farmers themselves are not only fast, but also of good quality. In the past, we always emphasized the lack of technical force, and many projects could not be started early. Now it seems that this reason is not sufficient either.

In the winter construction in Daling, the masses also created many advanced experiences, such as "knife-pulling and soil-cutting grid method," "soft soil slope method," and "flat paving and embankment method." The more they worked, the more enthusiastic they became, and they expressed one after another: "Willing to endure a year of hardship to exchange for ten thousand years of happiness," "Now there is a network of ditches and ponds, and in the future there will be rows of willows, and the depressions will become granaries." More than 1,000 people from 14 cities and counties have visited there. Seeing their enthusiasm for fighting nature in the severe cold of minus 20 to 30 degrees Celsius during winter construction, they were all very moved.

From the waterlogging control work in Daling District, we have learned a valuable experience and lesson: as long as we consult with the masses, truly mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and arouse enthusiasm, and do not be discouraged, there will be no difficulties that cannot be overcome. What Daling District can do, other districts can also do. This is the case in water conservancy construction, and the same is true in other aspects of work. Therefore, we have full confidence in achieving the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule, and we are confident that we can complete the requirement of developing paddy field irrigation area to 18 million mu (currently 4.5 million mu) in our province within the next ten years five years ahead of schedule.

If there are any improprieties in my speech, I hope that all representatives will criticize and correct them.

　　吃得一年苦　换来万年福
    大岭群众根治水患干劲十足
    栗又文代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告，薄一波副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告，吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告和彭真副委员长全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    我现在谨就吉林省冬季兴修水利的情况，以怀德县的大岭区为例，向大会作一简单的发言，因为全省的情况还没有很好的总结，更谈不到什么突出的经验，只是说明在冬季严寒的条件下一样的可以兴修水利，而且只要发动了群众，鼓起干劲就没有不能克服的困难，这股干劲就是我们省提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的可靠保证。
    吉林每天百余万男女上战场  争先恐后向大自然进行斗争
    吉林省在发展农业生产方面本来有很多有利的条件，但是在第一个五年计划期间却是“三灾两平”，没有一个丰收年，其中最主要的原因是由于水没有治好，没有把水害变成水利，突出的表现在，对于治理内涝认识不足，措施不力。以至在第一个五年计划期间，平均每年遭受水灾折成颗粒不收的面积就达到六百七十五万亩，占全省总耕地面积的百分之九点七八，而其中由于内涝成灾的竟占水灾总面积的百分之六十以上。这就成为我们连年完不成粮食生产任务的关键。这个问题如不能够得到解决，农业生产情况是不会有什么好转的，更谈不到飞跃发展了。
    自一九五七年九月，中共中央、国务院发出“关于今冬明春大规模地开展兴修农田水利和积肥运动的指示”以后，我省和全国各地一样，出现了一个空前规模的群众性的以水利和积肥为中心的农业生产高潮，而且正在以排山倒海之势，冲破一切右倾保守的障碍，向着更广泛更深入的方向发展。现在全省每天约有一百二十余万男女劳动力，以无比的热情，在冰天雪地之中，争先恐后的向大自然进行斗争，水利建设、积肥和副业生产都有很大的跃进。根据一月十五日的统计：全省已经修好的各项水利工程有九千一百九十九处，可以扩大灌溉面积九十六万八千七百四十五亩。正在动工的各项水利工程还有一万三千九百五十八处，竣工之后，可以扩大灌溉面积七十四万三千六百四十亩。以上两项合计共可扩大灌溉面积一百七十一万二千三百八十五亩，超过省原计划的百分之十四点一六。有些县已经修好的工程超过省计划指标的百分之三十到一倍，全省将会大大突破原计划指标。群众性的治涝工程，已经完成二百八十三万八千零八十五亩，超过省计划指标的百分之三十八点二二，有些县已经超过了省计划指标的一倍到两倍，全省广大农民正在“争取二年消灭内涝”（原定七年）的口号下，向今冬完成治涝工程三百七十五万亩的目标奋勇前进。
    三个多月的群众实际行动，给我们上了深深的一课，同时也破除了许许多多的迷信。去年秋天我省召开的水利工作会议上，有的人认为：“省里的计划太高了，难以实现”。事实上，群众一开始行动，省原提的计划指标就被突破了，许多地区，都是几次修改计划，几次被突破。我们也曾一再的批评右倾保守思想，实际上仍然是落后于形势的发展，这就充分说明了我们过去对群众的力量和智慧是认识不足的。在东北最冷的“三九天”，广大群众还是以无比的热情在严寒中苦斗，许多工地为了防止土层冻结，设法昼夜施工，晚间在工地上到处可以看见篝火或灯笼在闪耀着。群众提出：“不怕风吹、不怕天寒，修完工程再过年”，“贪大黑，起大早，跟着月亮跑”等等豪迈的口号。
    过去一提兴修水利工程，首先遇到的是时间和劳力问题。许多人认为适合修工的季节，正是农忙的季节，冬天比较有些时间，但又不利于施工，即或勉强施工，也不能保证工程的质量。怀德县的大岭区大规模的治涝工程，就打破了这种迷信。
    大岭地区地势低洼水患连年  过去缺少一套完整治水方案
    大岭地区，东西宽十二公里，南北长四十公里，全区包括二十六个乡，四十二个农业社，一万五千户，六万五千三百六十三个人，实有耕地面积七十七万三千六百四十五亩，其中涝洼地占三十九万多亩。该地一般土质比较肥沃，大部是黑粘土，适合于各种作物的生长。但是由于地势低洼，经常受到内水和外水的威胁，从一九五三年到一九五六年，累计决口淹地达二十万零五千三百二十亩，内涝达七十五万亩，共计减产粮食四万八千一百六十八吨，国家为了救济和扶持灾民恢复生产，几年来发放救济款四十六万余元，贷款一百三十五万余元。一九五六年的灾情最大，全部耕地只收三成多，其中三十九万亩洼地颗粒没收，仅这一年就调入粮食四千四百八十吨。“春修堤，夏防泛，秋冬救灾”已成为这个地区经常的重要中心工作了。
    俗语说：“不怕欠年，就怕连年”。这个地区几年来连续遭到水灾，土质碱化严重，有些耕地变成了洼塘。社员用打油诗形容常年积水的洼地说：“棒打鸳鸯瓢舀鱼，野鸡飞到饭锅里”。由于粮食连年减产，群众的生活也逐年下降，生产情绪很不稳定，全区有一千三百多户要求搬家，昌隆一社就有三百多户要走，占该社总户数的百分之四十。他们的流行话是：“要想穷，住昌隆，要想发，住崔家”（昌隆地洼，崔家地势高），“树挪死，人挪活”，“人往高处走，雀往亮处飞”。正是由于这种情况，使一些基层干部也失去了信心。怀德县的领导干部对这个地区曾经提出过许多办法，也采取了一些措施，但究竟如何治理，仍然没有一套完整的方案。最后还是请教于群众，他们分头下乡，到处查看和访问农民，先后共邀请了五百多名老农谈话并和基层干部一起商量，听取他们的批评和意见，有些老农民就说：“光排水不行，要治水必须蓄水，要牺牲小块地，救出大块地，不能叫山水进洼地”。县里根据所收集到的资料和群众的建议并实际进行踏查，了解情况，在水利部门的帮助下，确定了以治涝为主，结合兴修农田水利和蓄泄兼施以蓄为主的方针。
    访问群众请教老农订计划  决定掀起冬季施工的高潮
    方针确定后，即进行勘测，干部也同时深入群众，家家访问，征求意见，群众感激的说：
  “这是给我们造福来了”，有些老年人说：“官家帮助修水利，我拚着老命也得干”，一些距离工地较近的人家都纷纷表示：“将来挖到我家的院心也没意见，房子挡碍我就搬家，只要把水治住，比什么都好”。这不仅对群众是个很大的鼓舞，同时也深刻了解到群众对治涝的迫切要求，更加坚定了领导的信心。但在准备冬季施工的过程中，又出现一些新的顾虑，基层干部的保守思想还没有完全消除，他们怕作了工，不起作用，受群众的埋怨，又怕本乡本地修了，上游不修还得受灾，而对于冬季施工则更是普遍的认为进度慢、损失大、收效少。针对这种情况，怀德县领导同志一方面组织干部学习全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）和中央关于开展水利建设高潮的指示，展开了辩论，提高了认识，打破了顾虑。另方面又帮助群众算四笔账：一算减产账，说明不治涝生活不能提高；二算今后出路账，扭转了悲观情绪；三算远景账，指出修好水利的美好将来；四算活计和劳力账，证明这项工程是可以完成的。经过“四算”之后，打消了群众的顾虑，提高了信心，鼓起干劲，掀起冬季施工的高潮。
    要做到沟塘成网洼地变粮仓  雪深三尺地冻五尺难不住人
    按着他们的规划，全区治涝采取三个步骤。第一步，先作蓄洪区、截水沟等控制工程，以解决过去单纯排水，反而造成洪水泛滥的局面。第二步，做干沟、支沟、集水沟、断沟等排水工程和田间工程。第三步，利用蓄水池，大力发展养鱼、养鸭、种苇子、菱角、鸡头米等，以达到综合利用，全面发展的目的。
    截至一月十七日当我到大岭的时候，他们已经修完了蓄洪区九处，干沟三十七条，截沟六条，支沟九十条，围堤十三处，涵洞八座，大坑五处，桥梁六座，共计土方六十二万三千五百方。第一步和第二步的工程已经基本完成，只差少部分排水工程和田间工程没完。当时正是东北最冷的时候，雪深三尺，地冻五尺，但是群众的劲头很大，在像石头一样的冻地上，积极的挖沟。预计今年第三步工程也可以完成，当年就可以收效，估计比一九五七年至少能增产二万多吨粮食。一个连年遭灾的地区，在一年之间就能够完全转变过来，这并不是什么奇迹，而是由于党的号召和群众的干劲。在上述规划全部实现以后，全区各项收益可以达到五百一十二万多元，按人口平均每人可得七十八元多，因此群众高兴的讲：“一九五八年到一九五九年我们就可以赶上富裕中农的水平了”。
    对于这个地区的工程只是蓄洪区和大干沟是由省水利局技术人员负责的，一般的工程都由区、乡干部领导，至于田间工程则完全由社自己来搞。这样既解决了技术力量不足的困难，又培养起一批农民技术员。农民自己修的工程，不仅进度快，而且质量也很好。我们过去总是强调缺乏技术力量，好多工程不能早日施工，现在看来这个理由也是不够充分的。
    大岭在冬季施工中，群众还创造出很多的先进经验，如“拉刀切土拉格法”、“软土作坡法”、“平铺起堤法”等等。他们越干越起劲，纷纷表示：“愿吃一年苦，换得万年福”、“现在沟塘成网，将来杨柳成行，洼地变成粮谷仓”。现在已经有十四个市县的一千多人去那里参观过。看到他们冬季施工，在零下二十多度到三十多度的严寒中和自然搏斗的那股干劲，都很受感动。
    我们从大岭区治涝工作中，得到一条宝贵的经验教训，凡事只要和群众商量，真正发动群众，依靠群众，鼓起干劲，不要泄气，就没有不能克服的困难。大岭地区能做到，其他地区也能做到，兴修水利方面如此，其他工作方面也同样如此。因此，我们有充分的信心提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），并且对于我省在今后十年内，水田灌溉面积发展到一千八百万亩（现有四百五十万亩）的要求，我们有把握提前五年完成。
    我的发言，有不妥之处，希各位代表多多批评指正。
