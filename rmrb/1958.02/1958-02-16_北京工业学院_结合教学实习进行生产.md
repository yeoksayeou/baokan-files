Beijing Institute of Technology
Combining Teaching Practice with Production

(Our dispatch) Beijing Institute of Technology is actively responding to the call to transform laboratories into factories and has decided to merge the machinery and equipment of the laboratories of various departments with the original practice factory to establish a larger factory.

During the rectification movement, Beijing Institute of Technology implemented the spirit of running the school diligently and thriftily, producing diligently and thriftily, and studying while working, and further examined the low utilization rate of laboratory instruments and equipment. According to statistics, among the metal processing machine tools in several experimental units, about one-third were idle all year round or for most of the year, and only one-third were used at 50% or slightly higher. This is mainly because some experimental units like to turn their laboratories into all-encompassing exhibitions, believing that this will allow students to "learn more new things," one-sidedly pursuing results that are more, better, and newer. Therefore, the conditions for establishing a larger factory by using existing equipment without additional investment are fully available.

In order to uniformly use and allocate resources, fully utilize the potential of these devices, ensure teaching practice, and adhere to the principle of production, the school decided that, starting in February, all departments' laboratories with machinery will be consolidated to establish a large college-wide factory and implement enterprise management. This factory will have a joint laboratory, an instrument manufacturing department, and a practice department. This will further enrich teaching content and improve teaching quality, and will be more conducive to combining with production. Conducting production through teaching practice can enhance students' socialist consciousness and work interest, while strengthening their sense of responsibility, making them more conscientious in their work.

Beijing Institute of Technology has made significant achievements in running the school diligently and thriftily and producing diligently and thriftily in the past. In recent years, the employees of the college's practice factory have been engaged in production activities combined with teaching practice. They accept orders during non-teaching hours. In the past year alone, they manufactured 316 kinds of instruments related to scientific research for both inside and outside the school. Preliminary estimates show that they created wealth worth 232,750 yuan for the country. For example, instruments made for various laboratories within the school include non-directional gyroscopes, command instruments, centrifugal rotating instruments, center of gravity inspection instruments, and automatic frequency measuring instruments. Among them, centrifugal rotating instruments were not available domestically and had long delivery times and high costs (approximately 20,000 yuan), while self-manufacturing only cost 643 yuan, and more importantly, solved the urgent needs of teaching. At the same time, they also made more than 5,000 heating fins, 1,800 heating water pipes, and more than 100 faucets for the school. Completed external orders include: manufacturing 100 internal gear pumps for the Beijing Automobile Assembly Plant, and currently manufacturing ten horsepower testing machines (hydraulic dynamometers) for units such as Wuhan and Beijing Construction Workers Technical Schools.

They are currently manufacturing three-centimeter and ten-centimeter wavemeters needed for radio research. In the past, such instruments were only solved through imports. Now, the school has successfully trial-produced them and will mass-produce them for relevant applications. They will also trial-produce diesel engines to support agricultural construction. Some of the practice is done by students. For example, 200 small hand hammers and 100 vices. Next semester, based on practice, students also plan to produce 500 sets of water tanks for flush toilets, to further achieve the combination of teaching and production.

The above are only the accomplishments of the college's practice factory; the instruments made by the various departments' laboratories have not yet been included in the statistics. In the future, after the establishment of the college's larger factory, it will be able to produce more machinery and instruments to meet the requirements of scientific research and teaching, and create more wealth for the country.

### 北京工业学院  结合教学实习进行生产

    北京工业学院
    结合教学实习进行生产
    本报讯　北京工业学院积极响应把实验室变成工厂的要求，决定把各系实验室机器设备与原实习工厂合并起来，成立一个较大的工厂。
    在整改中，北京工业学院贯彻勤俭办校、勤俭生产、勤工俭学的精神，进一步检查了实验室仪器、设备利用率低的情况。据统计，几个实验单位的金属加工机床中，常年或大半睡觉的约占三分之一，使用在50％或稍高一点的只占三分之一。这主要是一些实验单位，喜欢把自己的实验室搞成无所不有的展览会。认为这样才可以使学生“多学点新东西”，片面追求又多、又好、又新的结果。因此，利用现有设备，不需要另外投资成立一个较大的工厂条件完全具备。
    为了统一使用，统一调配，充分发挥这些设备的潜力，保证教学实习，进行生产的原则，该校决定从2月份起把各系实验室有机器的部分，全部集中起来，成立一个全院大的工厂，并实行企业化管理。这个工厂下设联合实验室，仪器制造部，实习部。这样做将更丰富教学内容和提高教学质量，更有利于结合生产。通过教学实习进行生产，能提高学生的社会主义觉悟和工作兴趣，而增强了责任感，工作起来更加认真。
    北京工业学院过去在勤俭办校、勤俭生产方面，取得了显著的成绩。几年来这个学院的实习工厂的职工们，在结合教学实习进行生产活动，利用教学以外的时间接受订货，仅去年一年就为校内外制造了有关科学研究方面的仪器等三百一十六种，初步估计，就为国家创造财富二十三万二千七百五十元。如给校内各实验室做的仪器有无定向陀罗仪、指挥仪、离心回转仪、重心检验仪、测定自动频率仪等。其中离心回转仪在国内购不到，订货时间长、价值高（约两万元），而自己制造只花了六百四十三元，更重要的是解决了教学上的急需困难。同时还给校内做了暖气片五千多片，暖气水管一千八百条，自来水龙头一百多个。校外订货已制成的有：为北京汽车装配厂制造了一百台内轮齿泵，现正在为武汉、北京建筑工人技术学校等单位制造十台马力试验机（水力测功机）。
    现正在制造无线电研究方面所需用的三公分及十公分的波长计。过去这种仪器只靠进口解决，现在该校已试制成功，将多量生产以供有关方面应用。并将试制柴油机，支援农业建设。在实习中有一部分是学生做的。如小手锤子二百个，虎钳一百把等。下学期学生在实习的基础上，还计划生产抽水马桶上的水箱五百套，进一步做到教学与生产相结合。
    以上这些仅是该院实习工厂所做的，各系实验室所做的仪器尚未统计在内。今后该院较大的工厂成立后，将能生产出更多机器仪器，以解决科学研究和教学上的要求，并为国家创造更多的财富。
