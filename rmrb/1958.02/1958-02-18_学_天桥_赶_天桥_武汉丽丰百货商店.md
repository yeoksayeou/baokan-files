    学“天桥”赶“天桥”
    武汉丽丰百货商店
    据新华社武汉16日电　武汉市商业局干部建立的试验商店——丽丰百货商店，学习北京市天桥百货商场职工的革命气概，在15日向全市商业职工提出倡议，决心“学天桥、赶天桥、过天桥”。
    他们在倡议中提出：实行商品分挡定位定额制，做到商品不积压、不脱销，商店全年资金周转由去年八点八八次提高到十四次，争取达到十六次；从春节开始差错率最高不超过万分之零点五，争取全年不出差错；一天一班顶到底；保证在下半年把每个营业员每天卖钱额从五十元提高到一百一十元，行政管理费用比去年降低10％；保证执行“百问不烦，百选不厌”的服务公约，实行商品包调回换；不使一件进店商品残损变质，商店经常保持整洁；干部保证半年内在商店逐步熟悉本身所经营的业务知识，年底达到二级营业员的水平。
