Heilongjiang Province State-Run Chahayang Farm

Waste Exceeds Last Year's Total Output

　　This newspaper reports that a fire of burning waste has been ignited at the Heilongjiang Province Chahayang Farm's All-Staff Representative Assembly. Preliminary revelations show that the total value of waste and losses in all aspects of the farm reached more than 2.6 million yuan, exceeding the total agricultural output value for the entire year of 1957. Farms Three and Four suffered losses of nearly 400,000 yuan due to poor planning and land reclamation without surveying and design. Mechanical parts purchased by the farm in 1956, which could be used until 1959, tied up a large amount of capital. The efficiency of locomotive operations is not high, repair costs are high, and fuel consumption is high. According to comrades from Farms One and Five, each locomotive wastes 1.5 to 5 kilograms of fuel each time it is refueled. The five combine harvesters in Farm Four only harvested 19 hectares of grain in nine days, and the income was not enough to pay wages. Waste of manpower is even more common. Due to unreasonable quotas and low labor efficiency, there is a surplus of personnel.

　　Grain is wasted at every stage from storage and transportation to sales and consumption. In the past year alone, Farms Three and Four and the processing plant had 90,000 kilograms of moldy (including some downgraded) grain. In terms of capital construction, there is much that is not suitable.

　　The Chahayang Farm's Rectification Leadership Group, based on materials revealed by the masses, is now moving the rectification movement to a deeper stage and has initially drafted plans to reform the farm system, streamline institutions, and reform the wage system. In terms of streamlining institutions, it is planned to reduce the farm's original 509 management cadres (accounting for 8.57% of the total number of employees) to 51 (accounting for 0.92% of the total number of employees). The wage reform mainly implements the principle of more pay for more work and less pay for less work. (Su Yang)

　　黑龙江省国营查哈阳农场
    各项浪费竟超过去年生产总值
    本报讯　黑龙江省查哈阳农场的全场职工代表大会上，点起了燃烧浪费的大火。从初步揭发，全场各方面浪费损失总值达二百六十余万元，超过了1957年全年农业生产总值。该场的三、四场因计划不周、未勘测设计就开荒而损失近四十万元。该场在1956年采购的机械零件，可用到1959年，积压了大量资金。机车作业效率不高，修理费用高、燃油率高，据一、五场同志揭发每台机车加一次油，就要浪费一公斤半到五公斤油。四场的五台康拜因脱谷机，九天只脱了十九垧地的谷，收入不够付工资。人力的浪费更为普遍。由于定额不合理、劳动效率低、结果人浮于事。
    粮食从保管、运输到销售消费的每个环节中都有浪费，仅三、四场及加工厂在去年一年霉烂的（包括部分降等的）粮食达九万公斤；在基本建设方面多而不适用。
    查哈阳农场的整风领导小组已根据群众揭发的材料，正把整风运动转向深入阶段，并初步拟定了改革农场体制、精简机构和改革工资制度等方案。在精简机构方面，准备将全场原有的五百零九名管理干部（占职工总数的8.57％），减少为五十一名（占职工人数的0.92％）。工资改革主要是贯彻多劳多得、少劳少得的原则。　（苏泱）
