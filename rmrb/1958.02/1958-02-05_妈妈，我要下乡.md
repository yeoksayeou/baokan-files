　　Mom, I Want to Go to the Countryside
　　Jin Shan
　　Mom's letter asked me to return to my hometown for the New Year,
　　I said I am ready to go to the farm village.
　　Mom said a child doesn't leave her mother,
　　I said flowers in a greenhouse cannot withstand wind and frost.
　　Mom's letter asked me why I'm going to the farm village?
　　I said it's hard to take on construction without ability.
　　Mom said her child has culture after graduating from university,
　　I said I still have to start over at the "Labor University."
　　Mom's letter told me to dress warmly and not catch a cold,
　　I said the comrades take care of me better than at home.
　　Mom said don't work too hard in labor,
　　I said how can I pretend while tempering and transforming?
　　Mom's letter asked me if I'll return to school in the future?
　　I said the organization considers things better than we do.
　　Mom said the hygiene in the countryside is poor and life is hard,
　　I said I am determined to build the countryside like the Soviet Union!

　　我说要建设没有本领难承当。
　　妈说孩儿大学毕业有文化，
　　我说“劳动大学”我还得从头上。
　　妈妈来信要我穿暖别着凉，

　　我说锻炼改造哪能装模样。
　　妈妈来信问我将来是否回学堂？
　　我说组织考虑得比咱更妥当。
