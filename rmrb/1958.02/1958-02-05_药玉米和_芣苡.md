Medicinal Corn and "Fuyi"
　　Xuan Cao

The People's Daily reported on January 7th that a large amount of medicinal corn was being planted in Shangshui County, Henan Province, and praised it as a "Thousand-Li Horse" discovered in agricultural production in the commentary, which is really gratifying.

The large-scale planting of medicinal corn is a new discovery and a new initiative. But upon closer examination, it is one of the oldest crops in our country.

Medicinal corn, also known as Job's tears, entered the realm of people's lives as early as the legendary era of Chinese history. Legend has it that Yu's mother gave birth to Yu after swallowing Job's tears, so the Xia clan was surnamed "Si" ("Si" means descendants of "Yi"; just like the Yin clan's grandmother Jian Di gave birth to Shang after swallowing the egg of a black bird, so the Yin clan was surnamed "Yan"; Zhou clan's grandmother Jiang Yuan gave birth to Qi after stepping on the footprint of a giant, so the Zhou clan was surnamed "Ji"). Look! Job's tears became the ancestor of the Xia clan!

Medicinal corn was also planted in large quantities in ancient times, as evidenced by the Book of Songs. There are three chapters of "Fuyi" (pronounced fu yi) in the Book of Songs, Zhou Nan [note], and "Fuyi" is "Job's tears." This poem sings the labor of collectively harvesting medicinal corn. Every time I read it, a scene of medicinal corn all over the mountains and fields unfolds before my eyes: its flowers are in full bloom, and the abundant seeds shine with colorful colors in the autumn sun. Groups of ancient working women were interspersed among them, busily collecting while singing loudly and heartily. What a vivid and lively picture!

In the Book of Songs, this is the only poem that specifically sings about harvesting labor. No other crop has gained such a prominent position as medicinal corn. It can be seen that medicinal corn was widely planted in the Zhou Dynasty, at least in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty.

For some reason, the planting of medicinal corn gradually decreased after the Qin and Han dynasties. In the early Eastern Han Dynasty, General Ma Yuan specially brought back a large cart of Job's tears seeds from the south after returning from battle. It was suspected by people to be pearls and large shells, and it was thought that Ma Yuan had made war fortune in the south. This is the famous "Slander of Job's Tears" in history. Ma Yuan was very annoyed by this incident and finally announced what he had brought back to quell people's suspicions. This incident shows that medicinal corn was no longer planted on a large scale in the north at that time. Later, Job's tears finally withdrew from the realm of people's daily food consumption and only retained its position in the Compendium of Materia Medica, becoming a medicine for treating diseases or a tonic to be tried occasionally. Nowadays, some places add a little Job's tears when cooking Laba porridge, and it has become one of the eight treasures. But today, after being buried for more than a thousand years, it has been rediscovered by people and has received the evaluation it deserves. Just like a pearl buried in the soil is excavated again, the mud on its body is wiped off, and it will immediately emit a dazzling brilliance.

From this, I thought of the strange explanation of Fuyi by Mao Zhuan, saying something like: "Fuyi is the beauty of the empress. Peace, then women will be happy to have children." "Fuyi, Ma Xi, Ma Xi, plantain. It is suitable for pregnancy." So for two thousand years, the more it was explained, the more confused it became. No one has figured out what this poem is about. It was not until after liberation that it was returned to its original appearance of singing labor, and there was no more "beauty of the empress." However, due to the lack of production knowledge among intellectuals, it is still unclear what "Job's tears" is, so they have to continue to use the "plantain" explanation. As is the case with many vernacular translations published recently. Mr. Yu Guanying directly translated it as plantain seeds. It is difficult to imagine that such a small wild grass of only a few inches long would be worth planting on such a large scale; it is even more difficult to understand what important position it occupied in people's lives and why it would be worth singing about it so enthusiastically. In fact, this poem has still not been understood. Only Mr. Wen Yiduo almost touched the correct answer to this question. He explained "Fuyi" as "Job's tears," which is correct. But he said that he had never seen the shape of plantain, nor had he seen Job's tears, so he could not correctly answer the meaning of the collective labor sung in this poem. Now, after the introduction by the People's Daily, the meaning of this poem can be said to be completely clear. Medicinal corn has very vigorous and bold growth and high yield. Even under the conditions of very low productivity, it can be planted in large quantities for daily consumption. This is the basis for our ancestors to plant it on a large scale in ancient times, and it is also the basis for using large-scale collective labor during harvest. It is seven or eight feet high, has a large yield, many ears, and small seeds. When ripe, the color of the seeds is colorful. Therefore, the poem describes its color as "cai cai"; the actions of picking, selecting, gathering, and stripping are used to harvest it; and it is loaded with clothes and pockets like picking cotton. Look, the poem's description is so consistent with the growth of medicinal corn. We might as well try to translate the poem "Fuyi" as follows:

[Lead singer] Medicinal corn bears seeds, beautiful colors, hey—
[Chorus] Come, come, come and pick.
[Lead singer] Medicinal corn bears seeds, beautiful colors, hey—
[Chorus] Come, come, come and pick.
[Lead singer] Medicinal corn bears seeds, flowers all over the hillside, yo—
[Chorus] Pick them up in bunches.
[Lead singer] Medicinal corn bears seeds, flowers all over the hillside, yo—
[Chorus] Strip them down in handfuls.
[Lead singer] Medicinal corn bears seeds, beautiful colors, hey—
[Chorus] Hurry, hurry, put them in your arms.
[Lead singer] Medicinal corn bears seeds, beautiful colors, hey—
[Chorus] Carry them back in big bags and small bags!
[Note]: The original poem is as follows
　　Picking Job's Tears, pick them
    Picking Job's Tears, have them
    Picking Job's Tears, gather them
    Picking Job's Tears, strip them
    Picking Job's Tears, lift the hem
    Picking Job's Tears, tuck in the front

### 药玉米和“芣苡”

　　药玉米和“芣苡”
　　宣草
    1月7日人民日报报道了河南商水县大量种植药玉米的消息，并在评论中把它誉为农业生产上发现的千里马，这真令人高兴。
    药玉米可以大量种植是一个新发现、新创举。但如果仔细考查起来，它却是我国最古老的一种农作物。
    药玉米又名薏苡，远在中国历史的传疑时代，就已经进入了人民生活的领域。传说禹的母亲就是吞了薏苡才生禹的，夏氏族因而姓“姒”（“姒”就是表示是“苡”的子孙的意思；就好像殷氏族的老祖母简狄因吞了玄鸟卵而生商，殷氏族就姓“燕”；周氏族的老祖母姜嫄因履大人迹而生弃，周氏族就姓“姬”的道理一样）。看！薏苡竟成为夏氏族的祖先了！
    药玉米在古代也曾被大量种植，这可以从诗经里找到证据。诗经周南有“芣苡”（音浮以）三章〔注〕，“芣苡”就是“薏苡”。这诗歌唱了集体收获药玉米的劳动，每次读到，眼前就展现出满山遍野都是药玉米的景象来：它的花儿盛开着，丰盛的子实在秋天的阳光里闪耀着五彩缤纷的颜色。成群的古代劳动妇女夹在其间，一面忙忙地采集，一面纵情地大声歌唱。这是一幅多么鲜艳而生动的图画！
    在诗经里，像这样专门歌唱收获劳动的诗还只有这一首。别的任何农作物还没有博得像药玉米这样显耀的地位。可见药玉米在周代，至迟在东周时代，就已被广泛地种植着了。
    不知道什么原因，药玉米的种植在秦汉以后竟渐渐少起来。东汉初年，马援将军作战回来，还曾特地从南方载回一大车薏苡的种子。它被人们怀疑为明珠大贝，认为马援在南方发了战争财。这就是历史上有名的“薏苡之谤”。马援被这件事闹得非常恼火，终于把所载的东西公布了出来，才平息了人们的怀疑。这件事说明薏苡在当时的北方已经没有大规模的种植了，后来薏苡终于退出了人民日常生活食用的领域，而只在本草纲目上保留了它的地位，成为一种治病的药物，或是偶尔尝试的一种滋补品了。现在，有些地方熬八宝粥时要放进一点苡仁，它已成了八宝之一了。但是今天，它在沉埋了一千多年以后，又被人们发掘出来，并且得到了它应有的评价。这就像埋藏在土内的明珠又被人发掘出来一样，揩掉了身上的泥土，马上又将放出耀眼的光辉。
    从这里我就想起了关于芣苡，毛传曾作了一个奇怪的解释，说甚么：“芣苡，后妃之美也。和平，则妇人乐有子矣。”“芣苡、马舄，马舄、车前也。宜怀妊焉。”于是两千年来是越解越糊涂。谁也没弄清楚这首诗究竟是说的怎么回事。一直到解放以后才还给了它歌唱劳动的本来面目，不再闹什么“后妃之美”了。但是由于知识分子对生产知识的缺乏，对于“薏苡”究竟是什么东西仍然不明白，只好还沿用“车前”的说法。如近来出版的许多白话翻译都是如此。余冠英先生直译作车前子。很难想像车前这种只有几寸长的野生的小草会值得这样大规模地种植；更难理解它究竟在人民生活中占了怎样重要的地位，为什么会值得人们这样热情地歌唱它。实际上，这首诗仍然没有被了解。只有闻一多先生差不多触到了这一问题的正确答案。他把“芣苡”解释为即“薏苡”，这是正确的。但他说他没有见过车前的形状，也没见过薏苡，因此也不能正确解答这首诗里所歌唱的集体劳动的含义。现在经过人民日报的介绍，这首诗的含义才可说是真象大白。药玉米的生长力非常旺盛、泼辣，产量又高，就在生产力还很低的条件下也可以大量种植来供日常食用。这就是我们的祖先在古代把它大规模种植起来的根据，也就是在收获时要用较大规模的集体劳动的根据。它有七八尺高，产量大、穗头多、子粒小，成熟时子粒的颜色五彩斑烂。所以诗里形容它的颜色“采采”；要用采、有
  （择）、掇、捋等动作来收获；而且要像摘棉花一样用衣襟、口袋来装它。看，诗里所描绘的和药玉米的生长情况是这样吻合。我们不妨尝试着对“芣苡”一诗作如下翻译：
    〔领唱〕药玉米结籽儿好花彩，嗳—
    〔合唱〕快来，快来，快来采。
    〔领唱〕药玉米结籽儿好花彩，嗳—
    〔合唱〕快来，快来，快来摘。
    〔领唱〕药玉米结籽儿花满坡，哟—
    〔合唱〕一嘟噜一嘟噜的快拾掇。
    〔领唱〕药玉米结籽儿花满坡，哟—
    〔合唱〕大把大把地往下捋。
    〔领唱〕药玉米结籽儿好花彩，嗳—
    〔合唱〕快点儿快点儿往怀里揣。
    〔领唱〕药玉米结籽儿好花彩，嗳—
    〔合唱〕大兜儿小兜儿的往回抬！〔注〕：原诗如下
　　采采芣苡　薄言采之
    采采芣苡　薄言有之
    采采芣苡　薄言掇之
    采采芣苡　薄言捋之
    采采芣苡　薄言袺之
    采采芣苡　薄言襭之
