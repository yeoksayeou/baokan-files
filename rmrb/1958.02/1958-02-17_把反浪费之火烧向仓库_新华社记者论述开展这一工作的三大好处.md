Xinhua News Agency, February 16th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Feng commented on the significant meaning of directing the fire of anti-waste towards warehouses: In the national upsurge against waste, the shocking waste phenomena in many enterprise warehouses have been exposed. But this is only the beginning. It seems that now there is a great need to concentrate more intense anti-waste fire on warehouses. Doing so has three major benefits in terms of economics, ideology, and operations: First, it can mobilize huge material and financial resources to accelerate our country's socialist construction. Second, it can combat the subjectivism, bureaucracy, and localism in the management of various enterprises or institutions. Third, some operational problems in material reserves can be solved through the mass line.

Warehouses are an important gateway for our country's means of production and part of the consumer goods from production to use or consumption. They are the treasure troves where each unit and our country store their assets. Therefore, there is a lot of "oil and water" to be gained from anti-waste or conservation in these places.

The role of inventory is to both ensure the country's production and construction and the market's material supply, and to avoid excessive stockpiling of materials or funds. This is a unity of contradictions. If this work is not done well, it will affect the country's production and construction or the market's material supply, or waste material and financial resources due to excessive stockpiling. Past facts have proven that our country has made great achievements in this area, which goes without saying. But there are also some problems and shortcomings in this work, mainly the unclear inventory of warehouses in various departments; the excessive amount of reserves of certain materials, and the excessively long turnover period. Taking steel as an example, at the end of 1956, the total inventory of various user departments accounted for 46% of the country's total steel production that year. This quantity was already very large, but by the end of 1957, the total inventory of steel in various user departments not only did not decrease, but increased by 250,000 tons compared to the end of 1956. Our country does not produce much steel, and a large amount of steel is needed to expand production and construction scale, but nearly one-half of the country's total steel production is often piled up in warehouses for "standby." The time it takes for these steel materials stored in the warehouse to turn over once was as long as six months in 1957. That is to say, in order to ensure production and construction, various user departments often stockpile steel in their warehouses that is sufficient for six months of use by the department. Judging from the situation in various aspects, the steel reserves of various user departments are too large, and the turnover period is too long. Because the steel produced in our country is by no means shipped to the user departments once every six months. In 1956, the turnover period of steel inventory in various user departments across the country actually reached five and a half months. After the Beijing No. 3 Industrial Bureau took some measures in the second half of last year, the average turnover period of steel inventory in the 136 enterprises under the bureau has been shortened to two months. From this, it can be seen that the turnover period of steel inventory in various user departments across the country can be shortened. If the turnover period of steel can be shortened from six months in 1957 to four months, then, based on the amount of steel inventory in various user departments in 1957, more than 500,000 tons can be reduced. If these more than 500,000 tons of steel are of all varieties, it can greatly expand the country's production and construction scale, which is enough to meet the steel needed for the state's capital construction to increase investment by about 1.8 billion yuan (including the steel for manufacturing production equipment). It can be seen how much material potential is hidden in the warehouses! If the inventory of other means of production, such as machinery and equipment, and some consumer goods in the commercial departments of some places, which are stored in various user departments across the country, can also be reduced and the turnover period shortened under the conditions of ensuring production and construction and market supply, then its significant role in promoting the great leap forward in industry and agriculture and the prosperity of the market is also conceivable.

The working capital saved by the reduction of inventory and the shortening of the turnover period is also a huge sum of money in terms of tens of millions of yuan; people can also find some experience in saving working capital from it. This experience is very important to the country. Because after the construction of the first five-year plan, our economic work has initially achieved some major experiences in implementing the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift in capital construction and other aspects, but we still lack experience in using working capital (tens of billions of yuan are used for production and construction every year). The saving of working capital largely depends on the inventory material scheduling management and other work of various departments. Therefore, there is a lot of gold to be mined here.

There are many objective reasons for the excessive amount of some inventory and the long turnover period, such as the large country, the low level of planning, and the difficulty in grasping the source and distribution of materials; the variety of materials is not complete, some are not enough, and some cannot be used; the management level of enterprises is low, and there is no unified and appropriate reserve quota for various materials, and so on. However, according to the inspection of more than 1,200 enterprise warehouses in the national industry and transportation departments by the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Supervision, and the State Statistical Bureau on January 1, 1957, and according to the materials recently revealed in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Chongqing and other places, subjectivism, bureaucracy, and localism are also important reasons for the waste of stockpiled materials. For example, the user departments' "rather more than less" preparation of materials and the blind procurement of certain commercial departments are not isolated phenomena. As a result, some materials have been stockpiled for many years, and even some materials urgently needed by the society are moldy and rusty in the warehouse. Some enterprise leaders do not understand this waste at all, or understand it but do not have "the painful attitude of losing a yuan." Some material allocation departments do not understand the inventory and needs of various units, and wholesale and distribute numbers from above, which also promote the stockpiling of materials. In particular, some individuals in some enterprises still have varying degrees of localist thinking. They underreport inventory and overreport needs, and make false reports in order to "insure" their completion of production and construction tasks. Some people have also summed up a wrong experience from their own or other people's wrong behaviors, that is, "honest people suffer," as if they are willing to be a not "honest" person and make the country suffer. Moreover, even if it is found that they have surplus materials, they cannot be transferred to other places, as if there is a "local" ownership under the system of ownership by the whole people. Many facts in real life tell us that localism is a destructive ideology for the overall interests of the country and the socialist planned economy.

According to the materials revealed in the past inventory of warehouses and this anti-waste campaign, simply exposing the waste phenomena in warehouses cannot eradicate this waste. To eliminate this waste, it is necessary to criticize the ideological source of this waste - subjectivism, bureaucracy and localism, and material cleaning and ideological cleaning must be carried out simultaneously, remove these three bad isms from the warehouse, and fill the warehouse with the spirit of building the country with diligence and thrift. Many enterprises have started to do this. It seems that this should be the most important feature of this rectification campaign in clearing warehouses, which is different from the past clearing warehouses.

After criticizing or eliminating the ideology that causes material waste in warehouses, and the warehouse also has the spirit of building the country with diligence and thrift, some long-standing operational problems in material reserve work can be gradually and correctly resolved. For example, how to appropriately stipulate the reserve amount and turnover period of various materials, etc., the masses will definitely have many good suggestions in the anti-waste campaign to block waste loopholes. Therefore, directing the fire of anti-waste to warehouses will create favorable conditions for improving material reserve work.

    把反浪费之火烧向仓库
    新华社记者论述开展这一工作的三大好处
    新华社16日讯　新华社记者李峰报道把反浪费之火烧向仓库的重大意义说：在全国反浪费的高潮中，许多企业仓库里的惊人的浪费现象被揭露了出来。但这仅仅是开始，看来现在很需要集中更猛烈的反浪费之火，烧向仓库。这样作在经济上、思想上和业务上有三大好处：第一，可以调动出巨大的物力和财力加快我国社会主义建设。第二，可以反掉各个企业或事业单位经营管理上的主观主义，官僚主义，本位主义。第三，可以通过群众路线来解决物资储备方面的一些业务问题。
    仓库是我们国家的生产资料和一部分消费资料从生产到使用或消费过程中的一个重要关口，是每个单位也是我们国家储藏家底的宝地。因此，这些地方反浪费或节约的油水很大。
    库存物资的作用是既要保证国家的生产建设和市场的物资供应，又不能过多的积压物资或资金。这是矛盾的统一。这一工作做不好，就会影响国家的生产建设或市场上的物资供应，或者因过多的积压而浪费物力财力。过去的事实证明，我国这方面的工作有很大成绩，这是不需多说的。但这方面的工作也还存在着一些问题和缺点，主要是各部门仓库的家底不清；某些物资储备量偏多，周转期偏长。以钢材为例，1956年年底，各使用部门的库存总量占当年全国钢材生产总量的46％，这个数量已经就很大了，但是到1957年年末，各使用部门钢材的库存总量不仅没有减少，反而比1956年年底又增加了二十五万吨。我国产钢不多，又需要大量钢材来扩大生产和建设规模，而全国钢材生产总量的将近二分之一却经常堆存在仓库里“备用”。这些堆存在仓库里的钢材的周转一次的时间，1957年是六个月之久。就是说，各使用部门为了保证生产建设，仓库里经常积存着可供本部门六个月用的钢材。从各方面的情况来看，各使用部门钢材的储量是多了，周转期是长了。因为，我国生产出来的钢材绝不是六个月这样长的时间才向使用部门运发一次的。1956年全国各使用部门库存钢材的周转期实际上已经达到了五个半月。北京市第三工业局去年下半年采取了一些措施以后，这个局所属的一百三十六个企业的库存钢材的周转期平均已缩短到两个月。由此可见，全国各使用部门库存钢材的周转期是可以缩短的。如果能把钢材的周转期由1957年的六个月缩短到四个月，那末，按1957年各使用部门库存的钢材量计算，就可以减少五十多万吨。这五十多万吨钢材如果品种全齐，就可以使国家的生产建设规模大大地扩大，它足够国家基本建设增加十八亿元左右投资所需要的钢材（包括制造生产设备的钢材）。可见仓库里蕴藏着多大的物资潜力啊！我国各使用部门库存的其它的生产资料，如机械设备等，以及有些地方的商业部门库存的某些消费资料，如果也能在保证生产建设和市场供应的条件下减少库存量和缩短周转期，那末它对于促进工农业的大跃进和繁荣市场的重大作用，也是可想而知的。
    由库存物资减少及其周转期缩短所节省的流动资金，也是以万万元计的一笔巨款；人们还可以从中找到节省流动资金的一些经验。这种经验对全国来说，是非常重要的。因为经过第一个五年计划的建设，我们的经济工作，在基本建设等方面已经初步取得了贯彻执行勤俭建国方针的一些重大经验，而在使用流动资金（每年用在生产建设方面的流动资金有几十亿元）方面，我们还缺少经验。而节省流动资金在很大程度上取决于各部门的库存物资的调度管理等工作。所以这里大有黄金可取。
    有些库存物资量偏大，周转期偏长，这是有很多客观原因的，例如国家大，计划水平低，物资的来源和分配难掌握；物资品种不齐备，有的不够用，有的又用不了；企业管理水平低，各类物资没有统一而适当的储备定额等等。但是，根据国家经济委员会、监察部和国家统计局1957年1月1日对全国工业和交通部门等一千二百多个企业仓库的检查，根据最近上海、北京、天津、西安、重庆等地揭发的材料，主观主义、官僚主义和本位主义也是造成积压物资等浪费的重要原因。例如，使用部门“宁多勿少”地备料和某些商业部门盲目采购，还不是个别的现象。结果就造成了某些物资的长年积压，甚至使社会上急需的某些物资压在仓库里发霉生锈。对于这种浪费，有些企业的领导干部根本不了解，或者了解而没有“像自己失掉一元钱的痛心态度”。有的物资调配部门不了解各单位的库存和需要的情况，高高在上地批发分配数字，也促使了物资的积压。特别是有些企业的个别人员还有不同程度的本位主义思想，他们少报库存，多报需要，弄虚作假，以此来“保险”自己完成生产建设任务。有些人还从自己或别人这种错误的行为中总结出了一种错误的经验，即“老实人吃亏”，好像他们甘愿作个不“老实”的人而使国家吃亏。而且，即使查出他们有多余的物资，也不能外调，好像全民所有制下面还有个“本位”所有制。现实生活里的许多事实告诉我们，对于国家的整体利益和社会主义计划经济，本位主义是带有破坏性的思想。
    根据过去清查仓库和这次反浪费揭露的材料来看，单是揭露仓库里的浪费现象是不能根绝这种浪费的。要铲除这种浪费，就需要批判造成这方面浪费的思想根源——主观主义、官僚主义和本位主义，需要物资清理和思想清理双管齐下，把这三个坏主义清除出仓库，让仓库里也装满勤俭建国的精神。不少企业开始这样作了。看来这应该是这次整风中清查仓库不同于过去清查仓库的最重要的特点。
    批判或清除了造成仓库里物资浪费的思想，仓库里也有了勤俭建国的精神以后，物资储备工作中一些长期没有解决的业务性问题就容易逐步正确地解决了。例如各种物资的储备量和周转期怎样规定才适当等等问题，群众在反浪费堵浪费漏洞的大鸣大放中，一定会有很多好的建议。因此，把反浪费之火引向仓库，将为改进物资储备工作创造良好的条件。
