Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 15th: The soaring revolutionary drive of Shanghai's 1.7 million workers is being channeled in an organized way into a broad, deep, and sustained campaign to increase production and practice thrift. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has issued a call to all workers in the city to strive to accumulate 1 billion yuan in construction funds for the country this year, exceeding the plan.

In recent days, a moving scene has emerged throughout the city: everyone is carefully calculating, tapping potential day and night, and the overall goal of 1 billion yuan is being transformed into specific goals for each industry, each factory and store, and each worker. The results of calculations by only twenty-five factories and nine specialized companies show that more than 90 million yuan can be accumulated this year. The famous lathe cutting expert Sheng Li has made a guarantee that this year he will increase his workload, reduce the scrap rate, save alloy steel tools, and save 1,500 yuan.

Workers in the new joint ventures and small factories, with the greatest potential, are now also exceptionally active. The Zhongxin Screw Factory, with only twenty employees, originally planned to remit 57,000 yuan in profits this year according to administrative planning. After discussions within the work group, this figure jumped to 70,000 yuan, and after discussions among the masses, it jumped again to 90,000 yuan.

    超计划积累十亿元资金
    上海职工提出今年增产节约目标
    据新华社上海15日电　上海一百七十万职工高涨的革命干劲正在有组织地引向开展一个广泛、深入、持久的增产节约运动。上海市工会联合会已经向全市职工发出争取今年超计划为国家积累十亿元建设资金的号召。
    这几天来，全市出现了这样一个动人的场面：人人算细账，日夜挖潜力，十亿总目标正在化成每个产业、每个工厂商店、每个工人的具体目标。仅二十五个工厂和九个专业公司算账的结果，今年就可以多积累九千多万元。著名的车床切削能手盛利提出保证，今年要提高工作量、降低废品率、节省合金刀，节约一千五百元。
    潜力最大的新合营厂和小厂的工人，现在也异常活跃。只有二十个职工的中信螺丝厂，原来行政上打算今年上缴五万七千元利润，小组长讨论后跳到七万元，群众讨论后再跳到九万元。
