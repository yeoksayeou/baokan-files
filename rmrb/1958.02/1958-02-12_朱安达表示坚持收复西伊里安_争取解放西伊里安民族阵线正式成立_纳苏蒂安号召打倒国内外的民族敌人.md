Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 10th – Indonesian Prime Minister Juanda reiterated to the parliament on the 10th that Indonesia will continue to pursue its current policy of striving for the liberation of West Irian.

During a debate in parliament, Juanda said that the government is right to continue to pursue the path of striving for the recovery of West Irian, regardless of the enormous difficulties it faces at home and abroad. The government believes that this plan will surely be fruitful. He repeatedly said that the government’s report to parliament on the issue of liberating West Irian last December was correct.

Juanda said that the political situation in Indonesia, especially the disturbances occurring outside of parliament, are often exploited by hostile elements outside of Indonesia. However, the government has gradually succeeded in overcoming the difficulties.

Juanda said that the Netherlands will not easily hand over West Irian to Indonesia, and only when it faces Indonesia's national strength will the Netherlands return West Irian to its rightful owner. He pointed out that the Indonesian government's control over Dutch enterprises in Indonesia is not excessive.

Juanda called on all Indonesian people to be prepared to make some sacrifices in the struggle for the liberation of West Irian, and the government will spare no effort to overcome difficulties in order to alleviate the suffering of the people in the shortest possible time.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 11th – The National Front for the Liberation of West Irian, composed of Indonesian soldiers, workers, farmers, youth, and women, was formally established at the State Palace in Jakarta on the 10th.

Army Chief of Staff Nasution serves as the chairman of the National Front, and Colonel Sadiqin serves as the vice-chairman. The members of the National Front include representatives of people's organizations with different tendencies.

The decisions passed at the founding meeting of the National Front stated that the purpose of establishing this front is to complete the task of liberating West Irian within the scope of the national revolution. At the meeting, Nasution received an order signed by Second Deputy Prime Minister Idham Chalid, instructing the National Front to concentrate all national forces to carry out the struggle for the liberation of West Irian.

After the meeting, Major General Nasution met with thousands of people outside the State Palace and spoke. He said: The National Front will definitely be able to complete the task of liberating West Irian. He pointed out that the current obstacles are caused by foreign colonialists, who are politically and economically attacking the Indonesian people and the country. The enemies within Indonesia collude with conspiratorial groups to plot the assassination of Indonesian military leaders and government leaders, and to establish "another government" and "new country." The Army Chief of Staff also said: Facing this situation, the Indonesian people must strengthen their struggle, overthrow the Dutch colonialists and their lackeys in Indonesia. The primary task of the National Front is to suppress the enemies currently hiding in all strata of Indonesian society, suppress subversive activities, and completely eradicate the disruptive groups, and defend the unity of the Republic of Indonesia. The Army Chief of Staff also called on the Indonesian people to strengthen national unity.

    朱安达表示坚持收复西伊里安
    争取解放西伊里安民族阵线正式成立
    纳苏蒂安号召打倒国内外的民族敌人
    新华社雅加达10日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达10日再一次向国会表明，印度尼西亚将继续奉行就争取解放西伊里安所采取的现行政策。
    朱安达在国会举行辩论时说，政府不管在国内外遭到的巨大困难，仍然采取争取收复西伊里安的路线，这是正确的。政府相信这个计划一定会获得成果。他一再说，政府在去年12月就解放西伊里安问题向国会所作的报告是正确的。
    朱安达说，印度尼西亚国内的政治形势，特别是发生在国会以外的骚乱，常常会被印度尼西亚国外的敌对分子利用。但是，政府已经逐渐成功地克服了困难。
    朱安达说，荷兰是不会轻易把西伊里安交给印度尼西亚的，只有当它面对着印度尼西亚的民族力量时，荷兰才会把西伊里安交还给它的合法主人。他指出，印度尼西亚政府管制在印度尼西亚的荷兰企业并不是过分的。
    朱安达要求全体印度尼西亚人民在争取解放西伊里安的斗争中准备作一些牺牲，而政府将不遗余力地克服困难，以便在尽可能短的时间内减轻人民的痛苦。
    新华社雅加达11日电　由印度尼西亚的军人、工人、农民、青年和妇女组成的争取解放西伊里安民族阵线10日在雅加达的国家宫正式宣告成立。
    陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安担任民族阵线的主席，萨狄金上校担任副主席。民族阵线的成员中包括具有不同倾向的人民团体的代表。
    民族阵线成立大会上所通过的决定表明，成立这个阵线的目的在于完成属于民族革命范畴内的解放西伊里安的任务。纳苏蒂安在大会上收到了由第二副总理伊达姆·哈利德签署的一项命令，这项命令指示民族阵线集中一切民族力量，进行解放西伊里安的斗争。
    会后，纳苏蒂安少将在国家宫外面同数以千计的人们会见，并且讲了话。他说：民族阵线一定能够完成解放西伊里安的任务。他指出，目前的障碍是由外国殖民主义者造成的，他们正在从政治上和经济上进攻印度尼西亚人民和国家。印度尼西亚内部的敌人同阴谋集团狼狈为奸，阴谋暗杀印度尼西亚的军事首脑和政府领导人，成立“另一个政府”和“新国家”。陆军参谋长又说：印度尼西亚人民面对着这种情势，必须加强斗争，打倒荷兰殖民主义者和他们在印度尼西亚的走狗。民族阵线的首要任务在于镇压目前隐藏在印度尼西亚社会各阶层中的敌人，镇压颠覆活动和彻底铲除捣乱集团，保卫印度尼西亚共和国的统一。陆军参谋长还要求印度尼西亚人民加强民族团结。
