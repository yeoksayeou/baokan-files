Qin Xiuxi Creates Simple Leveling Instrument

    (Our dispatch) Qin Xiuxi, a Communist Party member from Qinzhuang, Dongguang County, Hebei Province, has created a simple leveling instrument modeled after surveying instruments. He uses a round paper tube with small holes at both ends, equipped with crosshairs inside, and a spirit level beside it for measurement work. In just over ten days, he surveyed more than forty canals, totaling over 59,000 meters in length and involving over 190,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Readings can be clearly seen at a distance of 25 meters for both foresight and backsight, with a daily progress of up to seven kilometers. When compared against a leveling instrument, the error is only 10 millimeters at a distance of 50 meters. This measuring instrument is simple in structure, low in cost (each costs only 0.5 yuan), and easy to use.

    Currently, various counties in the Cangxian Special District are manufacturing and promoting this simple leveling instrument.

    秦秀溪创简易水平测量器
    本报讯　河北省东光县秦庄共产党员秦秀溪，仿照水平仪器的样子，用圆纸筒两端留小孔，内装十字线，旁放水平管的办法进行测量工作，十几天内共测了四十多条渠道，长达五万九千多公尺，十九万余土方。前后视二十五公尺距离中，可以看清读数，日进可达七公里。这个仪器用水平仪校对，在五十公尺的距离中，误差仅相差十公厘。这种测量器构成简单，成本低（每架成本只需五角钱）、使用容易。
    目前沧县专区各县正在制造推广这种简易水平测量器。
