Notes

　　Putting the Cart Before the Horse
    The alarming increase in juvenile delinquency in New York City has caused great panic among the New York City education authorities. However, these officials, whose responsibility it is to cultivate the next generation, in order to try to curb the increasingly rampant trend of juvenile crime, are not taking radical measures to address the root cause, such as curbing obscene and lewd yellow books, movies, and television programs that teach theft and prostitution; instead, they are putting the cart before the horse, actually dismissing more than 640 middle and high school students as a perfunctory "suppression" measure.
    May I ask, can such "suppression" measures reduce criminal activity among American youth? According to police reports: Last year, the number of juvenile offenders arrested in New York totaled more than 157,000, an increase of 13.3% over the previous year. Needless to say, this year's record will probably break the 200,000 mark. People cannot help but sigh for the fate of American teenagers.

　　舍本逐末
    纽约市青少年犯罪活动的惊人增长，使得纽约市的教育当局也大感恐慌。但是这些以培养下一代为己任的官老爷，为了想抑止青少年日益泛滥的犯罪潮流，不是采取理根治本的办法，譬如抑制一下那些诲淫诲盗的黄色书刊、电影、电视节目等；而是舍本逐末，竟然以开除六百四十多名的中小学生的所谓“抑制”措施塞责。
    试问这样的“抑制”措施就能够减少美国青年的犯罪活动吗？据警察方面宣布：去年纽约逮捕的少年罪犯共达十五万七千多人，比前年增加了13.3％。不消说，今年的纪录大概是要突破二十万大关了。人们不能不为美国青少年的命运叹息。
