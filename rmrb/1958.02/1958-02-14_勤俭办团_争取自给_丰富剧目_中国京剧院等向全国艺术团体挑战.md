Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The heads of the China National Peking Opera Company, China National Pingju Opera Company, China Youth Art Theatre, and China Acrobatic Troupe, all directly under the Ministry of Culture, launched a challenge to national art troupes at the art troupe work conference, with the content of thrifty management, striving for self-sufficiency, and enriching repertoire. These four companies and troupes have been relying on state subsidies in the past. After a mass anti-waste debate, they decided to strengthen artistic practice and improve artistic quality, and from this year onwards, they will guarantee to be economically self-sufficient. They will use this great leap forward in thought and action to strive for a new prosperity in the arts together with national art troupes.

In their speeches, the heads of these four art troupes all expressed their warm response to the call of the Ministry of Culture to "go down to factories and the countryside, go deep among workers and peasants; adopt more realistic themes; be self-sufficient and frugal; and be full of energy, both expert and red." They guaranteed to achieve self-sufficiency this year and put forward plans for increasing production and practicing economy. Wu Xue, director of the China Youth Art Theatre, said that the theatre had decided to increase the number of plays staged this year, and guarantee that 60% would be newly created plays reflecting the real lives of workers, peasants and soldiers, performed by the main directors and actors. The theatre's performance plan for this year has been increased from 520 to 600 performances, one-third of which will be delivered to workers and peasant audiences. Xue Enhou, vice president of the China Pingju Opera Company, proposed that the theatre plans to perform 1,000 performances this year, double the number from last year. Yuan Sheng, deputy head of the China Acrobatic Troupe, proposed that the troupe will not only ensure a balanced budget this year, but also accumulate 50,000 yuan.

The heads of the Sichuan People's Art Theatre, the Xi'an People's Drama Theatre, and other units expressed their willingness to accept the challenge on the spot, and expressed their determination to learn from the revolutionary enthusiasm of their colleagues in the Youth Art Theatre and other four units, launch an anti-waste movement, and strive to achieve self-sufficiency.

In the past few days, some art troupes directly under the Ministry of Culture have launched a "competition of energy and advancement" in economics and ideology in the anti-waste and "self-sufficiency" debates. Actors and all staff have been inspired by unprecedented socialist revolutionary enthusiasm, carefully calculating accounts, digging up potential, and coming up with ideas to find a reliable solution to the difficult problem of "self-sufficiency". Li Shaochun, Li Hezeng, Yuan Shihai, Du Jinfang, the main actors of the China National Peking Opera Company and Xi Cailian, Xiao Bai Yushuang and other main actors of the China Pingju Opera Company all expressed that the conditions for striving for self-sufficiency are mature and the time has come; without public subsidies, they can fully guarantee that the plays will be performed more and better. In the past, Xiao Bai Yushuang performed an average of 14 performances per month, and she proposed to strive for 25 performances per month this year. Due to the enthusiasm of the actors and stage staff, the China Youth Art Theatre recently spent only 20 days and 700 yuan in production costs when rehearsing "Song of Youth." In the past, it would have taken at least three months and 3,000 to 4,000 yuan in production costs to rehearse such a large play.

In addition to these four theatres and troupes, many art troupes directly under the Ministry of Culture in Beijing are also enthusiastically discussing how to increase production and practice economy to achieve self-sufficiency in the short term. The staff and actors of the Central Experimental Opera House expressed their determination to break the convention that national opera houses must accept economic subsidies. After analyzing the specific situation, the theatre has now put forward the slogan "Work hard for one or two years, enrich the repertoire, and strive to achieve self-sufficiency by mid-1959."

    勤俭办团　争取自给　丰富剧目
    中国京剧院等向全国艺术团体挑战
    新华社13日讯　文化部直属的中国京剧院、中国评剧院、中国青年艺术剧院、中国杂技团的负责人13日在艺术团体工作会议上以勤俭办团、争取自给、丰富剧目为内容，向全国艺术团体发起挑战。这四个院、团过去一直靠国家补贴，这次经过群众性反浪费大辩论后，决定在加强艺术实践、提高艺术质量的前提下，从今年起保证在经济上做到自给自足，并以这一思想上、行动上的大跃进，同全国艺术团体一起争取艺术事业新的繁荣。
    这四个艺术团体的负责人在发言中，都表示热烈响应文化部提出的“下厂下乡，深入工农；现实题材，多多采用；自给自足，省吃俭用；干劲十足，又专又红”的号召，保证今年做到自给自足，并提出了增产节约的规划。中国青年艺术剧院院长吴雪说，这个剧院今年决定增加上演剧目，并保证有60％是新创作的反映工农兵现实生活的剧目，由主要导演和演员参加演出。这个剧院今年的演出计划已从五百二十场增定为六百场，其中有三分之一将给工农观众送上门去。中国评剧院副院长薛恩厚提出，这个剧院今年计划演出一千场，比去年增加了一倍。中国杂技团副团长袁声提出，这个团今年不仅保证收支平衡，还要积累五万元。
    四川人民艺术剧院、西安人民话剧团等单位的负责人当场表示应战，并表示学习青年艺术剧院等四单位同事们的革命干劲，发动群众掀起反浪费运动，争取做到自给自足。
    最近几天，文化部直属的一些艺术团体在反浪费和“自给自足”的大辩论中，在经济上和思想上展开了“比干劲，比先进”的竞赛，演员以及全体工作人员鼓起了空前的社会主义革命干劲，纷纷算细账、挖潜力、出主意，找到了解决“自给自足”这个难题的可靠办法。中国京剧院的主要演员李少春、李和曾、袁世海、杜近芳和中国评剧院的主要演员喜彩莲、小白玉霜等都表示，争取自给自足的条件成熟，时机已到；不要公家补贴，完全可以保证把戏演得又多又好。过去小白玉霜每月平均演十四场，她提出今年每月争取演二十五场。由于演员和舞台工作人员们鼓起干劲，中国青年艺术剧院最近排“青春之歌”时仅用了二十天的时间和七百元制作费，过去排这样大戏至少要用三个月和三、四千元制作费。
    除去这四个剧院、团以外，文化部直属在北京的许多艺术团体也都在热烈讨论如何增产节约，在短期内达到自给。中央实验歌剧院的工作人员和演员们表示有决心打破各国营歌剧院必须接受经济补贴这个常规。这个剧院在分析了具体情况以后，现在已经提出“苦战一、二年，丰富上演剧目，力争在1959年中做到自给”的口号。
