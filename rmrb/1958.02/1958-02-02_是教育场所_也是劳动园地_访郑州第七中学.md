　　Is Education Place and Labor Field
　　——Visiting Zhengzhou No. 7 Middle School
　　By Our Correspondent Cui Xiaotong
    When I first arrived at Zhengzhou No. 7 Middle School and spoke with the Director of Studies, Comrade Mao Mingzhang, he said with a regretful tone: "It would be better if you came in the spring or summer!" At first, I didn't quite understand what he meant. After extensive conversations with the teachers and seeing the environment around the school, I understood the meaning of his words. It turned out that when the school was first established, the grounds were uneven. In the area of sixty mu, in addition to rows of gray buildings, there was only one elm tree. From the time the school was established, it mobilized teachers and students to devote themselves to the labor upsurge of beautifying the school and running it diligently and thriftily. All the teachers and students filled the low-lying areas of the field with their own laboring hands, greened the school environment with trees and flowers donated by the students, planted more than 5,000 trees inside and outside the school, cultivated more than 70 flower beds, and opened up and built a botanical garden and a small zoo, in which various crops, vegetables, nurseries were planted, as well as poultry and livestock were raised. One teacher said, "Seven Middle School is like a sea of flowers in spring and summer." Perhaps Comrade Mao Mingzhang was a little regretful because I couldn't see this beautiful scenery in winter!?
    No. 7 Middle School is located in the southern suburbs of Zhengzhou. It was established in 1954 on the basis of the No. 6 Middle School branch. Now there are fourteen classes and seven hundred and seventy-four students. From the time the school was established, the leadership attached great importance to labor education and organized students to participate in agricultural physical labor. At the same time, it also took some specific measures to organize students to work and study at the same time, and to practice diligence and thrift in running the school, with great achievements.
    Labor-assisted Study
    The organized work-study program in No. 7 Middle School began in the spring of 1956. However, at that time, they did not call it work-study, but labor-assisted study. There were two forms of labor-assisted study, one was that students participated in agricultural labor at home in their spare time, and the other was that students were encouraged to return to their hometowns to engage in agricultural and sideline production during the holidays. The former were mostly students within five or ten li of the school. Since the spring of 1956, the school has specially established day student classes (separately). According to the distance from the school, day students have full-time, alternate-day or three-day, and weekly day students. At present, the school has three full-time and three half-time day student classes, accounting for about half of the total number of students in the school. Day students can go home to work after finishing their homework in the afternoon after class. In summer, some students bring sickles and baskets when they go to school in the morning, and cut grass along the way when they go home after school; in winter, some students carry manure baskets when they go to school and pick up manure on the way.
    In order to facilitate day students to participate in labor production, the school explicitly stipulates that day students can not participate in extracurricular activities and go home automatically after completing their homework. At the same time, in order to enable these students to have work to do after returning home, the teachers also contacted agricultural cooperatives and asked the cooperatives to reserve certain farm work for the students, so that students can work after returning home, avoiding the phenomenon of looking for work randomly or not having work to do. In the agricultural cooperatives near the school, there are almost organized student production teams, they have their own captains, and they work separately on a piece of land. In addition to participating in public welfare labor in the school, boarding students who are far away from the school mainly engage in agricultural and sideline production during the holidays. In order to understand the labor situation of these students during the holidays and better educate and urge students to produce well, before the spring break in 1957, the school established a student holiday production report system. Each student brought a "Student Holiday Production Status Registration Form" when they went on holiday. Their labor performance and production results during the holidays were filled out by the agricultural cooperative (or production team). When school started, the students brought this form back and handed it over to the class teacher. This practice is in fact equivalent to the cooperative making an appraisal of each student's holiday labor. According to the opinions of the cooperative, the Department of Studies commended the good ones, and the class teacher and the Department of Studies patiently conducted individual education for the poor ones. Through these efforts, the students' enthusiasm for labor has been greatly stimulated. According to statistics from 1956 and 1957, the total number of work points earned by students in their spare time and during holidays was more than 600,500. In 1957, students cut more than 764,600 catties of grass. Among them, 187 students earned more than 2,110 yuan from sideline production in addition to participating in agricultural labor. Zhengzhou suburbs have suffered disasters in the past two years, but as a result of implementing labor-assisted study, the number of students who dropped out of school due to family economic difficulties has been greatly reduced. In the spring of 1956, there were 51 students who suspended or dropped out of school for the above reasons, and the number dropped to 3 for the whole year of 1957. Now, among the 774 students in the school, assuming that the tuition, miscellaneous fees, and book fees required by each day student per year are 16 yuan, and the food expenses are calculated at 54 yuan (actually, day students do not spend that much money eating at home), there are 85 students whose income from agricultural and sideline production exceeds this number, 181 students who reach this number, 308 students who can solve most of the tuition and miscellaneous fees and food expenses, 156 students who solve a small part, and the remaining 44 students are not children of farmers and mainly engage in public welfare labor without income. Xiao Zengshun, a student in Class 2 of the third grade, earned 930 work points from participating in agricultural labor throughout the year, and 20 yuan from sideline production, totaling about 100 yuan, which is enough for his annual study and food expenses. Jia Xiulan, a female student in Class 5 of the second grade, earned more than 800 work points last year. In addition to solving all her tuition, miscellaneous fees, and book fees, she also solved the food for her and her mother for the whole year. In addition, the amount of people's financial aid issued by the school has decreased year by year, which is most obvious among day students. Compared with Class 4 of the third grade (day student class) and Class 2 of the third grade (boarding student class), the day student class earned more than 14,000 work points more than the boarding student class in 1957. Last year, the day student class only received 102 yuan of financial aid, while the boarding student class received 874 yuan.
    At first, some teachers were ideologically opposed to students being day students and participating in labor in their spare time, fearing that it would affect their studies and health. For example, when some teachers saw students going home to produce, they questioned them: "Do you focus on studying or producing? If you want to produce, don't study." But the facts denied this view. Compared with the academic performance of day students and boarding students in No. 7 Middle School, day students are not that much worse. For example, in Class 4 of the third grade and Class 3 of the second grade, in the second semester of the 1956 academic year, 25 of the 29 boarding students had 4 or 5 points in each subject, accounting for 86%, while 67 of the 79 day students had 4 or 5 points in each subject, accounting for 84.8%. For example, in the mathematics competition held by the four classes of the first grade this year, the most number of day students participated from the preliminary round to the final round, and day students accounted for 2 of the 3 students who won the final victory. As for the health of the students, they are all very healthy because they often participate in physical labor. It can be seen that, whether from an economic point of view, or from the point of view of labor training and academic performance, being a day student is a good way to work and study.
    A Colorful Garden
    The botanical garden, zoo, and recently built greenhouse in No. 7 Middle School are regular labor places for students to engage in agriculture, vegetables, and breeding, and also experimental gardens that closely combine teaching and production. The contents of the zoo and botanical garden are very rich, and there are more than 100 varieties of crops and vegetables alone.
    The botanical garden and zoo of No. 7 Middle School were cultivated and built by teachers and students themselves. The botanical garden used the open space in the schoolyard. About seven or eight mu were cultivated in 1955, but later some foundations were taken up because the school built new houses, and now there are only more than three mu. The investment in the zoo was the income from planting crops and vegetables in the botanical garden in 1956 and 1957. The chicken coop, rabbit house, beehive, and garden wall were all built by teachers and students themselves. Only the recently built greenhouse was funded by the state.
    The botanical garden and zoo are managed by students under the guidance of teachers. The vegetable area of the botanical garden is divided into several small pieces, and each class manages one piece, guaranteeing seeds and harvests; the cultivation and management of crops, nurseries, etc. are rotated by each class on duty; the zoo and greenhouse are managed by the 40 students of the Michurin group's agricultural technology and animal group. This division provides students with fixed places for regular labor, and strengthens their sense of responsibility. In their spare time, many students water, fertilize, weed, and catch insects in their own gardens, or raise pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, and clean the gardens. The work in the gardens is carried out during extracurricular activities. 80% of the income of the botanical garden belongs to the public, and 20% is used for class welfare.
    Teachers in No. 7 Middle School implement labor education in all subjects, especially agricultural technology courses, which are more closely integrated with the local production reality and the needs of current production, and the garden is the practice place for the theoretical knowledge of the classroom. For example, when wheat was about to be sown this semester, the agricultural technology course was scheduled to talk about climate and harvest. In order not to miss the season and enable students to actually master the technology of sowing wheat, the biology teacher Li Chenglong proposed and obtained the approval of the school leaders, and lectured on cultivated crops - wheat in the week of sowing wheat. A few days after the lecture, teacher Li Chenglong guided the students to do various experiments on sowing wheat in the garden, such as irrigation, sowing depth, density, broadcasting, hole sowing, strip sowing, fertilization, seed selection, and seed soaking. The seed soaking alone included five or six kinds of seed soaking with baking soda, warm water, cold water, and medicine mixing. Through the activities in the garden, students mastered production skills and enriched and consolidated classroom knowledge. Now, students in the second and third grades generally master the basic knowledge of cultivation management of the main crops in Henan Province - wheat, cotton, corn, and sweet potatoes, and have learned agricultural techniques such as plowing, harrowing, hoeing, and sowing. Many students have also learned the basic knowledge and skills of grafting more than a dozen plants, using chemical fertilizers, variable temperature seed soaking, artificial pollination, identifying plant diseases and insect pests, and epidemic prevention. In terms of animals, they generally learn the scientific knowledge of feeding management of chickens, ducks, pigs, and sheep, and some students learn the skills of beekeeping, raising castor silkworms, and sexual and asexual hybridization of more than a dozen animals.
　　The Fruits of Education
    No. 7 Middle School has consistently organized students to participate in physical labor inside and outside the school for several years. In addition to the above-mentioned labor, the school also organizes students to help agricultural cooperatives dig wells, harvest wheat, accumulate fertilizer, repair roads, and participate in the construction of school classrooms and auditoriums, etc. In the long-term education and in this labor environment, good results have been achieved. Students have formed the communist moral qualities of loving labor, being united and friendly, respecting teachers, observing discipline, and cherishing public property. Students' participation in physical labor has become a common practice. In the past, some students felt embarrassed when they met acquaintances while working at home, and the situation of covering their noses and passing by when they met someone carrying night soil no longer exists. What has replaced it is that students get shit, urine, fertilize, pick up manure, and use all their spare time to participate in agricultural and sideline production. According to the teachers of No. 7 Middle School who visited and learned about the situation of students who graduated and returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production during the summer vacation last year, the agricultural cooperatives and parents responded very well. After He Guoli, a graduate of Chai Guo Cooperative, returned to his hometown, the masses said that he had a particularly strong concept of labor, and he was not afraid of dirt or tiredness when he went to the night soil or brick kiln, and he did the work that others were unwilling to do. Li Shutian, the captain of the second production team of Fogang Cooperative, said: "The eight students who graduated from No. 7 Middle School in our cooperative have not forgotten their roots after going to school. They don't relax at all after school. They do whatever they are asked to do!" Zhang Laigui of Chai Guo Cooperative was elected as a labor model in the team only three months after returning to the cooperative to work.
    One of the important reasons why No. 7 Middle School's work-study program and labor education are so successful is that the school leaders first organized teachers to repeatedly study, armed teachers from a theoretical perspective and in terms of policies and guidelines, straightened and unified teachers' ideological understanding of labor education, and clarified that cultivating new laborers with awareness and culture is the glorious task of teachers. At the same time, the school also mobilized teachers to regularly participate in physical labor, so that they can develop labor habits and change their feelings about labor. In recent years, teachers and students have often participated in public welfare labor together. Now, from the principal to every teacher in No. 7 Middle School, everyone has their own shovel for labor. This has played a very important role in implementing labor education in various subjects, and has also had a very good impact on students. In addition to this, the school regularly publishes and commends students' labor achievements and model examples inside and outside the school in a timely manner, so as to educate students. This semester, labor advanced classes and labor activists among teachers and students were selected and rewarded throughout the school. All of these have stimulated students' enthusiasm and sense of honor in work-study programs and participation in physical labor. The labor education of No. 7 Middle School has blossomed and borne fruit, and has achieved great results. I hope they will continue to make persistent efforts and achieve greater achievements.

　　是教育场所　也是劳动园地
　　——访郑州第七中学
　　本报记者　崔筱桐
    当我初到郑州第七中学同教导主任毛明章同志谈话的时候，他以很遗憾的口吻说：“你要是春天或夏天来就好了！”开始，我不大理解这话的意思，经过同教师们广泛的交谈、看了这所学校周围的环境，我才知道了这话的含意。原来是这所学校刚建立的时候，校内场地高凹不平，在方圆六十亩的面积内，除了一排排的灰色建筑物外，只有一棵榆树。从学校建立时起，学校就发动师生投入美化学校、勤俭办学的劳动浪潮里，全体师生以自己劳动的双手填平了场内的凹地，以学生捐献的树木花草绿化了学校环境，在校内外植了五千多株树，栽培了七十多个花坛，开辟和修建了植物园、小型动物园，里面种植多种的农作物、蔬菜、苗圃，以及饲养家禽、家畜等。有一位教师说“春夏天七中像个花海。”大概就是因为在冬季我看不到这幅美丽的景色，毛明章同志有些遗憾吧！？
    第七中学在郑州市南郊，是1954年在第六中学分校的基础上建立起来的。现在有十四个班，七百七十四名学生。这所学校从成立的时候起，领导就很重视劳动教育和组织学生参加农业体力劳动，同时，还采取了一些具体办法组织学生边工边读，勤工俭学，成绩很大。
    劳动助学
    第七中学有领导的组织学生勤工俭学是从1956年春开始的。不过，那时他们不叫勤工俭学，而是叫劳动助学。劳动助学的形式有两种，一种是学生课余回家参加农业劳动，另一种是在假期里鼓励学生回乡从事农副业生产。前一种大都是离学校五里、十里以内的学生。从1956年春季开始，学校专门建立了走读班（单独编班）。走读的学生根据离校的远近，有全走读的，有隔日或三日、一周走读的。现在全校有全走读、半走读各三个班，约占全校学生总数的一半。走读学生每天下午下课完成作业，就可以回家劳动。夏季，有些学生早晨上学时带着镰刀、篮子，放学回家时沿途割草；冬季，有的学生上学时背着粪筐，往返路上拾粪。
    为了便于走读生参加劳动生产，学校明文规定走读生可以不参加课外活动，完成作业后自动回家，同时，为了使这些学生回家后有活干，教师们还同农业合作社联系，请社里给学生留出一定的农活，这样学生回家后就可以劳动，避免乱找活或没活干的现象。在学校附近的农业社，差不多都有有组织的学生生产队，他们自己有队长，他们单独在一块干活。离校较远的住宿生，除了参加校内的公益劳动外，主要是在假期里从事农副业生产。学校为了了解这些学生在假期的劳动情况，更好的教育和督促学生好好生产，1957年春假以前，学校建立了学生假期生产汇报制度，放假时每个学生都带一张“学生假期生产情况登记表”，他们在假期的劳动表现、生产成绩等，由农业社（或生产队）填写，开学时学生就把这张表带回交给班主任。这种做法，事实上等于合作社对每个学生假期劳动作个鉴定。学校根据社的意见，由教导处表扬好的，差的由班主任和教导处耐心进行个别教育。通过这些工作，大大激发了学生的劳动热情。据1956、1957两年统计，全校学生在课余和假期参加劳动所得的工分就有六十万零五千多个，1957年学生打草七十六万四千六百多斤，其中一百八十七名学生除参加农业劳动以外，从事副业生产所得收入达二千一百一十多元。郑州市郊近两年都有灾情，但实行劳动助学的结果，学生因家庭经济困难休学退学的人数大大减少，1956年春季全校因上述原因休、退学的有五十一人，到1957年全年降至三人；现在全校七百七十四名学生中，假定按走读生每年所需学杂费、书籍费十六元，伙食费按五十四元计（实际上走读生在家吃饭用不了这些钱），学生从事农副业生产的收入超过这个数字的有八十五人，达到这个数字的有一百八十一人，能够大部分解决了学杂费及伙食费问题的有三百零八人，解决小部分的有一百五十六人，其余四十四人非农民子弟，主要从事公益劳动，没有收益。三年级二班萧增顺全年参加农业劳动挣九百三十个工分，副业生产挣二十元，共约一百多元，足够他全年学习和伙食费用。二年级五班女生贾秀兰去年一年挣了八百多个工分，除了全部解决她的学杂费、书籍费外，还解决了她母女俩个全年的食粮。此外，学校发出的人民助学金额逐年有所下降，这在走读生中最为明显。三年级四班（走读班）和三年级二班（住宿班）相比，1957年走读生班比住宿生多挣得一万四千多工分，去年走读班只领了一百零二元助学金，住宿生班则领了八百七十四元。
    学生走读，在课余时间参加劳动，最初有的教师怕影响学生学习和身体健康，思想上是不通的。像有的教师见到学生回家生产即责问学生：“你是学习为主还是生产为主，要生产就别学习了。”但事实否定了这个看法。七中走读生与住宿生的学习成绩相比，走读生并不怎样差，如三年级四班、二年级三班，1956学年度下学期住宿学生二十九人各门功课四分、五分的二十五人，占86％，走读生七十九人各门功课四分、五分的六十七人，占84.8％。又如今年一年级四个班举行的数学竞赛，从预赛到决赛走读生参加的人数最多，最后取得优胜的三人当中，走读生就占了二人。至于学生的健康情况，由于他们经常参加体力劳动，身体都很健康。由此可见，不论从经济意义上，或从劳动锻炼、学习成绩看，走读是勤工俭学的好办法。
    丰富多彩的园地
    七中的植物园、动物园以及最近新建成的温室，是学生从事农业、蔬菜、饲养的经常劳动的场所，也是教学与生产密切结合的实验园地。动、植物园的内容十分丰富，仅以农作物和蔬菜类来说就有一百多种品种。
    七中的植物园、动物园是师生们自己开垦、建造起来的。植物园是利用校院里的空地，1955年开垦了约七八亩，后来因为学校建筑新房占去了一些地基，现在只有三亩多。动物园的投资是植物园1956、1957两年种植农作物、蔬菜所得的收入，鸡舍、兔舍、蜂箱以及园墙等都是师生自己修建的。只有最近新建的温室是国家拨给的经费。
    植物、动物园是在教师辅导下由学生管理的。植物园的蔬菜区分作若干小片，每班各管一片，保种保收；作物、苗圃等耕作管理由每班轮流值日；动物园和温室由米丘林小组的农业技术和动物组的四十名学生管理。这种划分，一方面学生经常劳动有了固定的地点，另方面加强了学生的责任感。在课余时，许多学生到自己的园地里浇水、施肥、拔草、捉虫，或者是饲养猪、羊、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔、打扫园地。在园地里的劳作都是在课外活动时间进行的。植物园的收入80％归公，20％作为班级福利用。
    七中的教师在各科教学中都贯串劳动教育，尤其是农业技术课更结合了当地生产实际和当前生产的需要，而园地便是课堂理论知识的实践地。例如本学期快要播种小麦的时候，农业技术课程却排的是讲气候和收成。为了不失时令，使学生实际掌握播种小麦的技术，生物教师李成龙提出并征得学校领导的同意，在播种小麦的一周，讲了栽培作物——小麦。讲完课不几天，李成龙教师指导学生在园地里做播种小麦的各种试验，如灌溉、播种的深浅、稀密、撒播、穴播、条播、施肥、选种、浸种等，仅浸种一项就作了小苏打浸种、温汤、冷水浸种、药物拌种等五六种之多。通过园地的活动，使学生掌握了生产技能，丰富和巩固了课堂知识。现在，二、三年级的学生一般都掌握了河南省主要农作物——小麦、棉花、玉米、红薯的耕作管理的基本知识，学会了犁、耙、锄、播种等农业技术，许多学生还学会了十多种植物的嫁接、使用化肥、变温浸种、人工授粉、识别病虫害、防疫等基本知识和技能。在动物方面，一般都学会了鸡、鸭、猪、羊、饲养管理的科学知识，有些学生学会了养蜂、养蓖麻蚕和十多种动物的有性、无性杂交等本领。
　　教育的果实
    七中组织学生参加校内外体力劳动，几年来是贯彻始终的。除了上述劳动以外，学校还组织学生帮助农业合作社打井、收麦、积肥、修路、参加学校教室、礼堂的修建工作，等等。在长期的教育和在这种劳动的环境中，已收到良好的结果，学生热爱劳动、团结友爱、尊师、守纪律、爱护公共财物的共产主义道德品质已经形成，学生参加体力劳动已成风气。过去，有些学生在家做活遇到熟人不好意思的心情，遇到挑大粪的掩鼻而过的事情已经没有了。起而代之的是学生弄屎、弄尿、施肥，拾粪，利用一切空余时间参加农业、副业生产。据七中教师访问了解去年暑期毕业回乡参加农业生产的学生的情况，农业社和家长反映都很好，柴郭社毕业生何国礼回乡后，群众说他劳动观念特别强，出大粪、下砖窑、不怕脏、不嫌累，人家不愿干的活他干。佛岗社第二生产队队长李书田说：“俺社七中毕业的八个学生，上了学，没忘本，下学校一点不放松，叫干啥干啥！”柴郭社的张来贵回社劳动仅仅三个月，就被选为队里的劳动模范。
    七中的勤工俭学、劳动教育所以搞的这样好，重要的原因之一，就是学校领导上过去首先组织教师反复学习，从理论上、方针政策上武装了教师，端正和统一了教师对于劳动教育的思想认识，明确了培养有觉悟、有文化的新的劳动者是教师的光荣任务，同时，学校还发动教师经常参加体力劳动，使他们养成劳动习惯、改变劳动感情。几年来，教师同学生经常在一起参加公益劳动，现在七中从校长起到每位教师都自备一把劳动用的铁锹。这对于在各科教学中贯彻劳动教育起了非常重大的作用，也给学生很好的影响。除此而外，学校经常及时公布、表扬学生在校内外的劳动成绩、模范事例，借以教育学生。这学期在全校范围内评选了劳动先进班，和师生中的劳动积极分子，并加以奖励。这都激发了学生勤工俭学、参加体力劳动的积极性和荣誉感。七中的劳动教育已经开花结果，有了很大的收获。我愿他们再接再厉，取得更大的成就。
