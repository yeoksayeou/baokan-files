    Exposing the Lies
    An American plane carrying nuclear weapons collided with another plane over Georgia and had to jettison its nuclear weapons into the Atlantic Ocean.
    Why did the American Air Force on this plane have to drop the nuclear weapons into the sea? It's simple: they were afraid of an explosion when the plane crashed. This exposes the lies that the American military authorities had previously told to reassure countries like Britain and France, claiming that there was no danger even if planes carrying hydrogen bombs crashed.

    鬼话戳穿
    一架带有核武器的美国飞机在乔治亚州上空同别的飞机互撞失事，不得不把核武器抛在大西洋中。
    这架飞机上的美国空军为什么要把核武器投诸大海呢？很简单，怕飞机坠毁时发生爆炸耳。这样，就戳穿了美国军事当局过去为了安定英法等国人心而胡说什么带氢弹飞机坠毁也没有什么危险的鬼话。
