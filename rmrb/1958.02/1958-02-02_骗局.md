Notes

After French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard begged for a batch of American "aid," he expressed overwhelming gratitude. According to Agence France-Presse, the Prime Minister even insisted that the American "aid" "did not come with any political conditions."

Associated Press reporter Gonzalez told the truth, pointing out that the American move was "out of political and military considerations." The facts also show that while the French government accepted U.S. dollars that were not cash, it gave away sovereignty and customs control. American rocket bases will be established on French territory, and French customs will be even more open to American goods than before.

Gaillard's words "without any political conditions" can only be described as a scam.

    骗局
    法国总理盖伊阿在乞求到一批美国“援助”之后，曾表示不胜感激涕零，而且据法新社报道，这位总理先生还硬说，美国的“援助”“不附带任何政治条件”。
    美联社记者冈萨雷斯说了老实话，指出美国此举是“出于政治和军事上的考虑”。事实也说明，法国政府一手虽然接受了并非现款的美元，一手却送出了主权和海关。法国领土上将要建立美国火箭基地，法国的海关对美国商品来说，将要比以前更加敞开大门。
    盖伊阿的“不附带任何政治条件”的话，只能说是骗局。
