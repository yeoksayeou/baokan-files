    Increase Tunneling Rate Every Day, Create New Records Every Month
    Representative Ma Wanshui Reports on the Leap Forward in Tunneling of Single-Headed Roadway at Longyan Iron Mine

    I fully endorse all the reports of the conference. Now, I will report on the production situation of our team.

    Our team is responsible for the tunneling of a single-headed roadway at the Longyan Iron Mine. Based on a monthly progress of 90 meters in October of last year, our tunneling speed leaped to 213 meters in January of this year.

    How did this great leap forward come about? It was through the implementation of the Party Central Committee's directives on rectification, launching the movements of "great airing of views, great debates, and great reforms." The mine's attendance rate increased from around 70 percent in the past to over 90 percent all at once. Some workers whose health had not fully recovered even sneaked into work, bringing the attendance rate to 100 percent. Just as our iron mine workers were working selflessly, we heard the call from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to "catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer." This greatly inspired our enthusiasm. Many workers said, "What's so great about Britain? We can definitely catch up with and surpass it!" This fully reflects the revolutionary heroic spirit of our working class. A "one task, one competition," "daily evaluation," and three-fast (fast drilling, fast loading, fast pushing carts), three-uniform (uniform supports, uniform tracks, uniform specifications) movement was launched in production. During rest periods, groups of three or five people could be seen everywhere discussing how to increase the production of iron ore, creating many advanced production experiences.

    The process of creating advanced experiences is also a process of overcoming difficulties. After July of last year, the workers first felt that the narrow tunnels could not fully utilize the workers' labor efficiency. After repeated research and discussion, the 3-meter-wide tunnel was changed to 4.8 meters, and the 7.7-square-meter small tunnel face was changed to a 14.4-square-meter large tunnel face, implementing the method of "one scoop to form" with large specifications. This production reform not only expanded the tunnel face, allowing the workers to swing their shoulders and exert their labor efficiency, but also saved more than half of the timber for supports and reduced the amount of explosives and detonators used.

    The expansion of the tunnel face was a new situation for us. It was obviously inappropriate to continue using the old method of "two slot cuts and one blast." How to use the new situation to increase the tunneling rate became a new problem that our team urgently needed to solve. In this situation, the workers in our team put their minds together and creatively came up with the "lower inverted pit" tunneling method, reducing the number of drill holes by one-third, shortening working hours, and greatly increasing the tunneling rate.

    While researching the "lower inverted pit" tunneling method, our team also made reasonable adjustments to the labor organization. In the past, two or three people used one pneumatic drill, which was a great waste of manpower. After reform, the method of "one person, one drill" was adopted, and the Soviet "air splitter" and "water splitter" were promoted. The two measures of "lower inverted pit" and "one person, one drill" more than doubled the tunneling rate.

    Due to the reform of production technology and the increase in tunneling rate, problems such as slow transportation and wasted work time appeared again. After the workers' research, they came up with three solutions: (1) Increase the size of the ore car from one ton to 1.7 tons; (2) Change the large sleepers to small sleepers, saving time in digging the track bed when moving the sleepers; (3) Move the track switches closer to the tunnel face, from 50 meters in the past to 20 meters, speeding up the turnover rate. As a result, the cleaning speed of the tunnel face was also greatly improved, which adapted to the increased tunneling rate.

    Precisely because of the above creations, the tunneling efficiency improved day by day and month by month. The monthly tunneling progress in November 1957 was 150 meters, which reached 170 meters in December. This January, it was raised again to a new national record of 213 meters.

    It should also be stated here that other tunneling teams in our mine, like our team, are also realizing a great leap forward in tunneling. Now, the tunneling rate of nine teams in our mine has increased from about 65 meters last year to 110 meters, four teams have increased to 150 meters, and one team has increased to 180 meters. The leap forward figures are not a few percent, nor a few tens of percent, but 100 percent, 200 percent, and 300 percent.

    We understand that the direction pointed out by the Party is the road for our progress, and the demands put forward by the Party are our aspirations. We will go wherever the Party points. Under the leadership of the Party, we can overcome any difficulty and accomplish any heroic undertaking.

    Now, our team has formulated a new production plan, which requires the tunneling rate to break through 300 meters in the next six months on sections of 14.4 square meters or more. In order to realize this plan, in addition to continuing to improve work through rectification, the workers have also put forward the slogan of "Red at the beginning, red every day, and red every month." Although our team created a new record of 213 meters in January of this year, this is just the beginning, and it is still far from 300 meters, and we will encounter difficulties. With the leadership of the Party and this revolutionary spirit, we will definitely be able to realize this year's plan, and we will be able to guarantee that we will catch up with and surpass Britain in about fifteen years.

    天天提高掘进率　月月创造新纪录
    马万水代表报告龙烟铁矿平峒单头巷道掘进工程跃进情况
    我完全拥护大会的各项报告。现在把我们小组的生产情况报告一下。
    我们小组在龙烟铁矿担任着平峒单头巷道的掘进工程，掘进速度在去年十月份月进九十公尺的基础上到今年一月跃进到二百一十三公尺。
    这个大跃进是怎样来的呢？这就是经过贯彻党中央整风指示，展开了大鸣大放、大争大辩、大改的运动，全矿出勤率由过去的百分之七十左右，一下子提高到百分之九十以上；有一些病还没有完全恢复健康的工人也偷着上班工作，出勤率就达到了百分之百。正当我们铁矿工人忘我劳动着的时候又听到党中央和毛主席发出了“在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国”的号召，这就又大大鼓舞了我们的干劲，很多工人说：“英国有什么了不起，我们一定能赶上和超过它！”这充分反映了我们工人阶级的革命英雄气概。在生产中掀起了“一事一赛”“一日一评”和三快（打眼快、装车快、推车快）、三齐（棚子齐、轨道齐、规格齐）运动；在休息时，到处可以看到三五成群的谈论着如何提高多产铁砂的问题，创造了不少的先进生产经验。
    先进经验的创造过程，也是克服困难的过程。去年七月以后，工人们在生产中首先感到的是，坑道狭窄不能发挥工人的劳动效能。经过多次研究讨论，把三公尺宽的坑道改为四点八公尺，把掌子面改为七点七平方公尺的小平峒改为十四点四平方公尺的大平峒，实行了大规格一勺成的作法。这个生产改革，不仅是扩大了掌子面，使工人们抡开了肩膀发挥了劳动的效能，而且还节约支棚木料一倍以上，减少了使用火药和雷管的数量。
    掌子面的扩大，对我们来说，是一个新的局面。仍用老一套的“两次拉槽一次爆破”的作法，显然是不适当的了。如何利用新局面提高掘进率，又成了我们小组的一个迫切需要解决的新问题。在这种情况下，我们小组的工人们又开动脑筋，集思广益地创造了“下部倒坑”的掘进法，减少了打眼数量的三分之一，缩短了工时，大大提高了掘进率。
    在研究“下部倒坑”掘进法的同时，我们小组对劳动组织也进行了合理的调整。过去两个人或三个人使用一台风钻，人力浪费很大，经过改革采用了“一人一钻”的方法，并推广了苏联的“分风器”和“分水器”，“下部倒坑”和“一人一钻”这两项措施就把掘进率提高了一倍以上。
    由于生产技术的改革，掘进率的提高，这就又出现了运输缓慢窝工等问题。经过工人们的研究想出了三个办法：（1）把斗车加大，由一吨加大到一点七吨；（2）把大道木改成小道木，移动道木时，节省了挖道底的时间；（3）把道岔子移近了，掌子面由过去的五十公尺移到二十公尺，加快了周转率。这样做的结果，掌子面的清理速度也大大提高，才适应了提高了的掘进率。
    正因为有了上述的创造，掘进效率一天一个样，月月有提高。一九五七年十一月份月掘进一百五十公尺，到十二月份达到了一百七十公尺。今年一月份再一次提高到二百一十三公尺的全国最高纪录。
    这里还要说明，我们矿的其他掘进小组和我们小组一样，也正在实现掘进的大跃进。现在我们矿里已有九个小组的掘进率由去年的六十五公尺左右提高到一百一十公尺，有四个小组提高到一百五十公尺，一个小组提高到一百八十公尺。跃进的数字，不是百分之几，也不是百分之几十，而是百分之一百、二百、三百。
    我们懂得，党指出的方向就是我们前进的道路，党提出的要求，就是我们的愿望。党指向那里我们就走到那里，在党的领导下任何困难我们都能克服，任何豪迈的事业我们都能办到。
    现在，我们这个小组又订了新的生产计划，这个计划要求在今后半年内在十四点四平方公尺以上的断面上掘进率突破三百公尺。为实现这个计划，除继续通过整风改进工作外，工人们还提出了“开头红、日日红、月月红”的口号。今年一月份我们小组虽然创造了二百一十三公尺的新纪录，但这仅仅是开始，距三百公尺还很远，还会遇到困难。我们有党的领导，我们有这股革命的干劲，今年的计划我们就一定能够实现，我们就能够保证在十五年左右的时间内赶上和超过英国。
