    Tunisia Forbids French Warships from Entering the Port of Bizerte
    French Masses Launch a Wave of Support for the Tunisian People
    Guy Mollet Argues Absurdly, Claiming Air Force Massacre of Women and Children Was “Self-Defense”
    (Comprehensive report from this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: The Tunisian government issued a statement on the evening of the 11th, stating that the Tunisian government had instructed its Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Mongi Slim, to formally submit the French military aircraft bombing of Sakiet Sidi Youssef incident to the United Nations Security Council.
    It is reported that prior to this, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had tried to dissuade Tunisia from doing so.
    On the same day, the Tunisian government closed five French consulates within Tunisia and ordered a ban on French warships entering the port of Bizerte. It warned that any warships attempting to force their way into the port would be fired upon. The government also stated that it would sink ships to block the waterway if necessary.
    Bizerte is located forty miles directly north of Tunis. It is France's largest naval base in North Africa. Since the Sakiet bombing incident, Tunisian President Bourguiba has demanded the withdrawal of French troops from all of Tunisia (including the Bizerte base).
    Amidst the wave of national protest against the French air force's atrocities, representatives of the Tunisian "Neo Destour" party and various people's organizations held a conference on the 11th. Leaders of the ruling "Neo Destour" party called on the nation to rise up and save the country from its difficulties. In addition, a "National Support Committee" has been formed, responsible for raising funds, food, and clothing to aid the victims of the Sakiet bombing and "other possible incidents." Furthermore, Tunisia is preparing to hold "Sakiet Day" on the 14th, on which day large-scale protest rallies will be held.
    Within France, the Sakiet Sidi Youssef incident has sparked an increasingly surging wave of protests among the masses.
    Duclos, on behalf of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Tunisian Communist Party, strongly condemning the bombing of Tunisian territory under the direction of the French government as a violation of international law, and guaranteeing that the French working class and the Communist Party would actively support the Tunisian people and would be determined to launch a deeper and broader struggle for peace in Algeria.
    The Central Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) also sent a telegram to the Tunisian General Labour Union, expressing deep sympathy and support for the Tunisian trade unions and all Tunisian working people, guaranteeing that it "will do everything possible to ensure that the independence and territorial integrity of Tunisia are respected in the future." The French CGT also decided to allocate 500,000 francs to the Tunisian trade unions to aid the victims of the bombing.
    The National Federation of Railway Workers, the National Federation of Textile Workers, the Construction Workers' Union, the National Federation of Food Industry Workers, and many other trade union organizations, affiliated with the French CGT, also sent telegrams protesting the French government's atrocities and expressing solidarity with the Tunisian workers. The French Federation of Metallurgical Workers and the National Federation of Miners each donated 50,000 francs to Tunisian trade union organizations.
    In addition, some left-wing progressive groups also issued statements condemning the government's aggressive behavior and demanding a speedy end to the Algerian war.
    On the 10th, a demonstration in support of the Tunisian people formed in front of the Tunisian Embassy in Paris. People gathered there, waiting to express their sympathy and friendship to the Tunisian Ambassador, who was leaving Paris to return home. Among these people were many political figures and social notables, including former Prime Minister Mendès-France, writer François Mauriac, Socialist Party members of parliament Robert Buron and Daniel Mayer, renowned political commentator Claude Bourdet, Communist Party members of parliament Fernand Grenier and Pierre Villon, as well as representatives of various social groups and youth groups belonging to different political factions.
    The French National Assembly began a debate on the afternoon of the 11th regarding the barbaric French air force bombing of the Tunisian village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef. The debate lasted eleven hours before it ended.
    Duclos, the chairman of the French Communist Party parliamentary group, was the first to speak in the debate. In his speech, he strongly condemned the French military's savage bombing of Tunisia and the government's overall policy on Algeria. Duclos once again called on the various left-wing parties to jointly seek a way to peacefully resolve the Algerian issue. "Progressive Republican Union" member of parliament Got and "Democratic Social Resistance Union" member of parliament Delouvrier both demanded an international investigation into the incident in their speeches.
    Socialist Party member of parliament Defferre and Independent Party member of parliament Monnet, however, insisted that the unprovoked bombing of the Tunisian village by French aircraft was self-inflicted.
    French Prime Minister Guy Mollet admitted that this atrocity was approved by the government. He stubbornly claimed that Tunisia was in a state of "war" with France due to its support for the Algerian people's struggle, and characterized the barbaric bombing of Tunisian women and children as an action with "purely military objectives," an "exercise of the legitimate right of self-defense." He implied that French troops might continue to conduct "retaliation" against Tunisia in the future, citing Tunisia's sheltering of the Algerian National Liberation Army as a pretext, and threatened the Tunisian government not to take "any adventurous actions," otherwise, "the Tunisian people will suffer first."
    With the support of the Socialist Party, Guy Mollet forced the National Assembly to pass a motion at the end of the debate, expressing "confidence" in the government.

    突尼斯不许法舰开进比塞大港
    法国群众掀起支援突尼斯人民的浪潮
    盖伊阿强词夺理硬说法空军屠杀妇孺是“自卫”
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：突尼斯官方11日晚上发表声明说，突尼斯政府已经指令它驻联合国的常任代表蒙吉·斯陵把法军飞机轰炸萨基埃特—西迪—优素福事件正式提交给联合国安全理事会。
    据报道，在这以前，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经竭力劝阻突尼斯不要这样做。
    突尼斯政府在同一天封闭了法国在突尼斯境内的五处领事馆，并且下令禁止法国军舰进入比塞大港。它警告要对任何企图强行进港的军舰开炮。政府还表示在必要时将沉船来封锁入港的水道。
    比塞大位于突尼斯市正北四十英里。它是法国在北非最大的海军基地。自从萨基埃特轰炸事件发生后，突尼斯总统布尔吉巴要求法军从突尼斯全境（包括比塞大基地在内）撤退。
    在突尼斯全国人民抗议法机暴行的浪潮中，突尼斯“新宪政党”和各人民团体的代表11日举行了大会。执政党“新宪政党”的领袖在会上号召全国人民起来拯救危难中的祖国。另外，已经组成一个“全国支援委员会”，负责募集基金、食物和衣服来援助在萨基埃特轰炸中以及在“其他可能事件”中的受害者。另外，突尼斯全国准备在14日举行“萨基埃特日”，在这一天将要举行大规模的抗议集会。
    在法国国内，萨基埃特—西迪—优素福事件在群众中引起了日益汹涌的抗议浪潮。
    杜克洛代表法国共产党中央委员会拍电报给突尼斯共产党中央委员会，猛烈谴责在法国政府指使下对突尼斯领土进行轰炸这种破坏国际法的行为，并且保证：法国工人阶级和共产党一定积极支援突尼斯人民，并且决心更加深入而广泛地展开争取阿尔及利亚和平的斗争。
    法国总工会中央执行局也给突尼斯工人联合会打电报，对突尼斯工会和突尼斯全体劳动人民表示深切的同情和支援，保证“将竭尽全力，使突尼斯的独立和领土完整在今后受到尊重”。法国总工会还决定拨款五十万法郎给突尼斯工会，救济轰炸中的受害者。
    隶属法国总工会的全国铁路员工联合委员会、全国纺织工人工会联合会、建筑工人工会、全国食品业工人联合会和其他许多工会组织，也分别打电报抗议法国政府的暴行，并且向突尼斯工人表示声援。法国冶金工人工会联合会和全国矿工联合会还各向突尼斯工会组织捐助了五万法郎。
    另外还有一些左翼进步团体也发表声明谴责政府的侵略性行为，并且要求尽速结束阿尔及利亚战争。
    10日在突尼斯驻巴黎使馆门前形成了一次声援突尼斯人民的示威。人们聚集在那里，等着向离开巴黎返国的突尼斯大使表达他们对突尼斯的同情和友谊。这些人里面有不少是政界名流和社会贤达，包括前总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯、作家弗朗索瓦·莫里亚克、社会党议员罗伯·柏尔基耶和丹尼埃·麦耶、著名政论家克劳德·布尔戴、共产党议员费南·格雷尼埃和皮埃尔·维戎以及属于不同政治派别的各种社会团体和青年团体的代表。
    法国国民议会11日下午开始就法国飞机野蛮轰炸突尼斯村庄萨基埃特—西迪—优素福事件举行辩论。辩论进行了十一个小时才结束。
    法国共产党议会党团主席杜克洛在辩论中第一个发言。他在发言中强有力地谴责了法军狂炸突尼斯的暴行和政府对阿尔及利亚的全盘政策。杜克洛再一次呼吁各左翼政党共同寻求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的途径。“进步共和联盟”议员戈特和“民主社会抵抗联盟”议员德利普科夫斯基都在发言中要求对这次事件进行国际调查。
    社会党议员戴克松、独立党议员蒙戴尔则把突尼斯村庄无端遭到法国飞机狂炸一事硬说成是咎由自取。
    法国总理盖伊阿承认这种暴行是得到政府批准的。他硬说突尼斯由于支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争已经同法国处在“交战状态”，并且把对突尼斯妇女和儿童的野蛮轰炸说成是具有“纯粹军事目的”的行动，是“行使正当的自卫权利”。他暗示法国军队今后还可能借口突尼斯掩护阿尔及利亚民族解放军而对突尼斯继续进行“报复”，并且威胁突尼斯政府不要采取“任何冒险行动”，否则，“突尼斯人民将首先遭殃”。
    由于社会党的支持，盖伊阿在辩论结束时迫使国民议会通过了一项提案，对政府表示“信任”。
