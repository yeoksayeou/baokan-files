　　Livestock Protection Work Must Implement the Class Line
    Many Cattle Died and Became Emaciated in Shengpu Township, Wuxian County
    (Our Dispatch) Xinhua Daily reported: The Wuxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently sent people to Shengpu Township to inspect the work of maintaining draught animals. They found that the failure to earnestly implement the class line in raising draught cattle was the main reason for the large number of deaths of cattle in some agricultural cooperatives.
    Shengpu Township has twenty-five agricultural cooperatives with one thousand two hundred and forty-eight head of draught cattle. Last year, a total of twenty-six head of draught cattle died in the township. The situation was most serious in Xinhua No. 13 Cooperative, where nine died in December alone. Currently, there are also many cattle that are thin and emaciated.
    The reason for the deaths of draught animals in a few agricultural cooperatives is mainly the improper selection of feeders and the failure to earnestly implement the class line. In the early stage of establishing advanced cooperatives in the township, because the original owners of the cattle had experience in raising them, it was once decided that the keepers would generally not be changed and would remain the original owners; in some cases, in order to take care of households with difficulties, a small number of cattle were also entrusted to households with difficulties for care. This measure seemed necessary at the time, but in its specific implementation, careful selection was not made. Among the eight hundred and fifty-six feeders in the township, fifty-three were landlords and rich peasants, and two hundred and sixty-nine were old upper-middle peasants. The enemy class elements harbored dissatisfaction with the cooperatives, and some of the old upper-middle peasants, with serious capitalist ideas, were not interested in running the agricultural cooperatives well. Therefore, the results of their feeding were poor. In Xinhua No. 13 Cooperative, which had the most cattle deaths, ten of the eighteen current feeders are upper-middle peasants. Of the twelve cattle that died, seven were raised by upper-middle peasants. Zhang Caigao, an old upper-middle peasant in the thirteenth team of the cooperative, had consistently been dissatisfied with the cooperative after joining, and sabotaged the cooperative's agricultural boats. The cooperative cadres did not raise their vigilance and still allowed him to raise a water buffalo. As a result of his irresponsibility, the cattle became emaciated and died. Xie Shoushan, an old upper-middle peasant in the eleventh team, was irresponsible in raising a cow and even stole and sold one thousand five hundred jin of rice straw. The cattle were often hungry, resulting in weakness and death.
    In addition, the keepers who were selected out of consideration for households with difficulties often lacked experience and ability in raising cattle, and therefore did a poor job of caring for them.
    The Wuxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued a circular demanding that the Party's class line be resolutely implemented in the selection of feeders.

### 保畜工作必须贯彻阶级路线  吴县胜浦乡不少耕牛死亡落膘

　　保畜工作必须贯彻阶级路线
    吴县胜浦乡不少耕牛死亡落膘
    本报讯　新华日报报道：江苏吴县县委最近派人到胜浦乡检查耕畜保养工作，发现饲养耕牛没有认真贯彻阶级路线，是部分农业社耕牛大量死亡的主要原因。
    胜浦乡共有二十五个农业社，一千二百四十八条耕牛。去年一年，全乡共死了二十六头耕牛，其中新华十三社最严重，只12月份就死了九头，目前瘦弱落膘的牛也不少。
    少数农业社耕畜死亡的原因，主要是饲养员选择不当，没有认真贯彻阶级路线。该乡在建立高级社初期，由于耕牛原主有饲养经验，一度曾确定保养人一般不动，仍由原主保养；有的为了照顾困难户，也有少数耕牛给困难户保养。这一措施在当时看来是必要的，但具体执行时，未能慎重挑选，全乡八百五十六个饲养员中，则有地主、富农五十三个、老上中农二百六十九个，而敌对阶级分子是对合作社心怀不满的，老上中农中有一部分资本主义思想严重的，也是无心于办好农业社的，因而饲养的结果不好。死牛最多的新华十三社，现有饲养员十八人中，上中农就有十人，死亡的十二头牛中有七头是上中农饲养的。该社十三队老上中农张采高，入社后一贯对社不满，破坏社内农船，而社干没有引起警惕，仍给他养一头水牛，由于不负责任，结果落膘、死亡。十一队老上中农谢寿山养的一头牛，饲养不负责，还偷卖掉一千五百斤稻草，耕牛经常挨饿，结果瘦弱不堪而死亡。
    另外，从照顾困难户出发确定的饲养员，往往由于缺乏养牛的经验和能力，因而保养得也很差。
    中共吴县县委已经发出通报，要求在饲养人员的挑选上，坚决贯彻党的阶级路线。
