Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: The Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress held preparatory meetings continuously from the 27th to the 31st. The representatives studied and discussed relevant documents in groups according to electoral units.

For the past few days, the representatives have generally held discussions on documents such as the 1957 State Budget Execution and the 1958 State Budget Draft, the 1958 National Economic Plan Draft, and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Draft. At the representative group meetings, the State Council sent responsible staff to explain the questions raised by the representatives and answer their questions in detail.

The five-day preparatory meeting enabled the representatives to have a relatively full understanding of the documents to be discussed at the conference before the formal meeting. This way of holding the meeting helps to further promote the spirit of democracy and enables the representatives to more fully discuss and supervise national affairs.

The great achievements of the national economic construction in 1957 and the good performance of the budget greatly encouraged the representatives. At the group meetings of the preparatory meeting, the atmosphere was very active. The numerous facts cited by the representatives proved that the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle had stimulated the revolutionary enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people. Although it is still the season of severe winter, the prelude to the great leap forward in economic construction in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan has already begun. The representatives pointed out that this year's state budget and national economic plan targets are likely to be broken by the surging enthusiasm and revolutionary zeal of the masses.

What is most inspiring is the vivid scenes of the peasants in various places carrying out large-scale water conservancy construction and accumulating fertilizer under the leadership of the Party and the government, as mentioned by the representatives at the meeting. In this movement, the broad masses of peasants launched a struggle against nature with overwhelming force. They said, "One year of hard work, ten years of happiness; ten years of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness." Some places put forward the magnificent slogans of "Carrying earth to make mountains, digging canals to make rivers" and "Making rivers change course and valleys become lakes." The heads of the local CCP organizations and governments moved their offices to the mountains, fields, and depressions, installed telephones, and, like commanding operations, led the masses to launch a vigorous winter production campaign. Moving deeds of thousands upon thousands of people who did not avoid wind and rain, worked day and night, competed between fathers and sons, and mobilized the whole family appeared everywhere. The representatives from Anhui said that in many places, agricultural production cooperatives were "eating meals by lamplight and going to work after the lights were turned off," building water conservancy projects day and night. The more than 1.6 billion cubic meters of earth and stone completed in Anhui were the result of this revolutionary enthusiasm. Representatives from Henan, Hebei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Gansu, Sichuan, and Inner Mongolia also spoke about the large-scale water conservancy movements in their provinces. In Shanxi Province, at the time of liberation, the entire province only had 3.6 million mu of irrigated land. Last winter and this spring, a high tide of large-scale water conservancy construction was launched, and water conservancy irrigation projects that can irrigate 3.94 million mu of newly built land have now been completed, and water conservancy projects for 3.53 million mu are currently under construction. The representatives of this province said that the farmers there have done in one year what their ancestors had done for thousands of years.

The representatives mentioned that the great call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer has inspired workers in various places. They are now trying every means to find ways to give play to their initiative and creativity to vigorously increase production and practice economy, and are stepping up their efforts to achieve this call ahead of schedule. Meng Tai, a representative from Liaoning Province and an industrial labor model, said that this great call has become the action slogan of the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel. When discussing this year's national plan, the workers of the No. 1 Ironmaking Plant where he works came up with various ways to increase pig iron production and strive to exceed the national plan. Tang Guifen, a representative from Shanghai, said that this great call has had an extremely profound impact on the working class in Shanghai, who have long been oppressed by imperialism. In the past month or so, many departments in the city have broken through outdated and conservative quotas, and production targets have been increased at all levels. The city's total industrial output value for 1958 has been revised twice, increasing to 12.3 billion yuan, an increase of 10% over the original plan. Zhu Shunyu, a representative from Shanghai and a labor model, said that in the surging tide of production, the workers of the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory proposed that, starting this year, they can start designing and trial-producing 50,000-kilowatt steam turbines without adding any equipment. It is expected that they will be manufactured in the next year or two, and by 1962, the factory's annual output of steam turbines will reach 600,000 to 800,000 kilowatts.

How to do more with less money has become the central issue discussed by many representatives. Some representatives suggested that everyone should use their brains at this meeting to help the country come up with various ways to spend as little money as possible and do more things, using one yuan as two yuan. Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, said that since the rectification movement, the idea of building the country through diligence and thrift has taken root in the hearts of the people. The Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory in Hubei Province mobilized the masses to find ways to clean and paint an old house that was prepared to run a nursery with only 30 cents, and the masses were very satisfied. This kind of thing should be greatly promoted. Representatives from Guangxi Province mentioned that last year, the province spent 30,000 yuan of state funds to build a water conservancy project that can irrigate more than 5,000 mu; last winter and this spring, they built another water conservancy project that can irrigate the same area, and the state only spent 3 yuan on lamp oil, and everything else was done by the masses themselves. People in Lijiang Prefecture, Yunnan Province, according to the principle of building the country and running enterprises through diligence and thrift, put forward the slogan of "building a family with bare hands." They decided to use the favorable conditions of abundant local resources to develop handicraft production, first using the simplest methods to develop mineral deposits, and then expanding the construction of factories and mines with the profits obtained from production after increasing production for the country and increasing income for the local people. He Wanbao, a representative from this province, said at the meeting: As long as we bite the bullet and persevere, working hard for three years, we will be able to quickly change the face of the Lijiang area.

Many representatives mentioned that there is much to be done in cultural education with less money. In 1957, Henan Province developed private middle schools, enrolling more than 138,000 junior high school students; one-third of the primary schools in Guizhou Province are private, and the number of students in private primary schools reached 400,000. Representatives from these two provinces have proposed that this policy should continue to be implemented in the future, which not only saves funds for the country, but also greatly promotes the development of education through the power of the masses. Yang Xiufeng, a representative from Hebei Province and Minister of Higher Education, said that in the past, higher education spent a lot of money on capital construction and equipment, especially in capital construction, where many houses were built, but the utilization rate was low. Some schools' scientific research equipment has reached the international level, but it has not been fully utilized. Therefore, there is still much room for saving in this year's budget for higher education.

The representatives pointed out that the great rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle have made the human factor and the political factor play an unexpected and great role in economic construction. The enthusiasm of the people across the country to forge ahead is like a torrent, promoting the great development of socialist cause. The representatives are prepared to reflect the heroic creations of the masses and the revolutionary enthusiasm and zeal of the masses at the conference. They said that five years look at three years, and three years look at the first year. This conference should make a good start for the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan.

The preparatory meeting ended today, and the conference will officially open on February 1. (Attached picture)

　　人民代表举出大量事实反映群众的英雄创造
    亿万人民革命干劲激动人心
    人大预备会议结束　正式会议今日开幕
    新华社31日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议从27日到31日，连续举行预备会议，代表们按选举单位分组研究和讨论有关文件。
    几天以来，代表们普遍就1957年国家预算执行情况和1958年国家预算草案、1958年度国民经济计划草案以及汉语拼音方案草案等文件进行了座谈。在代表小组会上，国务院都分别派出了负责工作人员就代表们提出的问题作了说明，并且详细解答了他们的疑问。
    通过五天预备会议的活动，使代表们能够在正式会议以前就比较充分地了解大会将要讨论的文件。这种会议的开法，有助于会议更充分地发扬民主精神，使代表们更充分地讨论和监督国家的事务。
    1957年国家经济建设的伟大成就和预算执行的良好情况，使代表们受到很大的鼓舞。在预备会议的各小组会上，空气很活跃，代表们举出的大量事实证明，整风和反右派斗争激发了亿万人民的革命干劲，现在虽然还是严冬岁首的季节，但是这第二个五年计划第一年的经济建设大跃进的序幕已经揭开了。代表们指出：今年的国家预算和国民经济计划的指标，都有被群众高涨的积极性和革命干劲突破的可能。
    最激励人心的是代表们在会上谈到的各地农民在党和政府的领导下大规模地兴修水利和积肥的生动情景。在这个运动中，广大农民以排山倒海之势展开了同自然界的斗争。他们说，“一年辛苦，十年幸福；十年辛苦，万年幸福”。有的地方提出了“挑土成山，开渠成河”、“叫江河改道，让山谷成湖”的雄壮口号。各地中共组织和政府的负责人，把他们的办公室搬到山区、田野、洼地，装上电话机，像指挥作战一样，领导群众掀起了轰轰烈烈的冬季生产大运动。各地出现了千千万万的不避风雨、日夜施工、父子竞赛、全家动员的动人事迹。安徽的代表们说，许多地方农业生产合作社都是“点灯吃饭，吹灯上工”，夜以继日地兴修水利。安徽所完成的十六亿多土石方，就是这股革命干劲得来的。河南、河北、江西、江苏、甘肃、四川、内蒙古的代表也都讲到了他们全省大规模的兴修水利运动。山西省在解放时，全省只有水地三百六十万亩。去冬今春掀起了大兴水利的高潮，现在已经完成了可以灌溉三百九十四万亩新修的水利灌溉工程，目前正在动工的还有三百五十三万亩的水利工程。这个省的代表们说，他们那里的农民在一年的时间内已经干了祖先们几千年干的事情。
    代表们谈到，党中央提出在十五年或稍多一点时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的伟大号召，鼓舞了各地工人，他们现在都千方百计地想办法，发挥积极性和创造性来厉行增产节约，为提前实现这一号召而加紧努力。辽宁省代表、工业劳动模范孟泰说，这个伟大号召已经成了鞍钢职工的行动口号，在讨论今年国家计划时，他所在的第一炼铁厂职工想出各种办法增产生铁，争取超过国家计划。上海市代表汤桂芬说，这个伟大的号召，在久受帝国主义压迫的上海工人阶级中发生了极为深刻的影响，一个多月来，全市许多部门都突破了陈旧的、保守的定额，生产指标层层加码、步步提高，1958年的全市工业总产值经两次修订，提高到一百二十三亿元，比原计划提高10％。上海市代表、劳动模范朱顺余说，上海汽轮机厂职工在汹涌澎湃的生产高潮中，提出从今年开始，不要增添任何设备就可以开始设计、试制五万瓩的汽轮机，预计明后年就可制成，到1962年全厂汽轮机年产量将达到六十万至八十万瓩。
    怎样少花钱多办事，成为许多代表谈论的中心问题。有的代表提出，在这次会上大家要开动脑筋，帮助国家想出各种办法，尽量少花钱，多办事，一元钱当二元钱用。湖北省省长张体学说，自从整风运动以来，勤俭建国的思想已深入人心，湖北省襄樊棉织厂发动群众想办法，只花了三角钱就把准备办托儿所的一所旧房子，打扫粉刷得干干净净，群众十分满意，这种事情应该大大提倡。广西省代表谈到，去年这个省花了国家三万元修了一项水利工程，可以灌溉五千多亩；去冬今春他们又修了一项可以灌溉同样面积的水利工程，国家只花了三元钱的灯油费，其他一切都是依靠群众自己办起来的。云南省丽江专区人民根据勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针，提出了“白手成家”的口号，他们决定利用当地资源丰富的有利条件，发展手工业生产，首先用最简单的办法把矿藏开发出来，等到为国家增加了生产和为当地人民增加了收入之后，再来用生产得到的赢利扩大厂矿的建设。这个省的代表和万宝在会上说：只要我们硬着头皮钻下去，苦干三年，我们就能使得丽江地区的面貌迅速改观。
    许多代表谈到，在文化教育方面少花钱多办事是大有可为的。河南省在1957年发展了民办中学，招收了十三万八千多名初中学生；贵州省有三分之一的小学是民办的，民办小学的学生达到四十万。这两个省的代表都提出，今后继续贯彻这一方针，不仅为国家节省了资金，而且可以通过群众的力量大大促进教育事业的发展。河北省代表、高等教育部部长杨秀峰说，过去高等教育方面，在基本建设、设备方面花钱很多，特别是基本建设方面，房子盖得多，但是利用率低。有些学校的科学研究设备，已达到国际水平，但是也没有充分发挥作用。所以今年预算中高等教育经费还大有节约的余地。
    代表们指出，伟大的整风和反右派斗争，使人的因素和政治的因素在经济建设中发挥了意想不到的伟大作用，全国人民奋发前进的情绪就像一股激流一样，推动着社会主义事业的大发展。代表们准备在大会上反映群众的这些英雄创造和群众的革命热情和干劲。他们说，五年看三年，三年看头年，这次大会要使第二个五年计划的第一年来一个好开端。
    预备会议今天结束，大会将在2月1日正式开幕。（附图片）
