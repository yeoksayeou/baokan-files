At this conference, after listening to the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support them. Looking at the figures in this year's budget and draft plan, I am particularly excited that the investment arrangements focus on construction, and each construction project is aimed at advancing by leaps and bounds in the context of the Great Leap Forward, and on the road to socialism. This represents the highest interests of the people of all nationalities in the country. This kind of planned and magnificent construction, this determination and great spirit to benefit the people, and the tremendous achievements already made in the past eight years can only appear under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and in a socialist social system.

I come from the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, a border region of the motherland. I am a Jingpo person, so I feel the changes in the Jingpo area even more deeply. Now I would like to talk to you about the changes in the Jingpo area:

As all representatives know, before liberation in 1950, we Jingpo people still lived a poor life at the end of primitive society. The Jingpo compatriots lived in deep mountains and forests, and the production method was slash-and-burn agriculture. For more than half of the year, we relied on picking wild fruits and digging wild vegetables to fill our stomachs. For many years, most of our people had never used oil lamps or covered themselves with quilts. At night, we burned tree bark as lamps, and in winter, we roasted by the fire as blankets. We had no culture and did not understand science. When people got sick, they used superstitious methods, killing cattle to sacrifice to ghosts. In some villages with more than two hundred households, more than one hundred and fifty cattle were killed in a year for sacrifices, seriously affecting production. Various diseases still spread, constantly taking the lives of adults and infants in our nation, and the population was constantly decreasing.

Politically, we had no rights at all before liberation. The Kuomintang reactionaries and Han chauvinist rulers called us "savages" and "uncivilized people." Their government officials and troops went up the mountains, catching chickens and killing ducks everywhere, raping and plundering, killing and arson, doing all kinds of evil. At the same time, they also provoked relations between us and other ethnic groups, deepening the divisions between our ethnic groups and causing mutual killings. These painful things, when I think about them today, still make people sad and angry.

However, after liberation, the Jingpo area changed, and it changed greatly.

First of all, we have gained the rights to be masters of our own affairs and ethnic equality in politics. Under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, we established the Dehong Autonomous Region in July 1953 and exercised various autonomous rights. In 1956, we reorganized it into the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in accordance with the principles stipulated in the Constitution. The Party and the People's Government are also very concerned about the production and life of our minority nationalities. Over the past eight years, huge amounts of free subsidies, loans, and relief funds have been distributed every year to help us solve difficulties in plowing cattle, farm tools, seeds, and food. With the specific help of the Han elder brothers and government cadres, the production technology of our Jingpo people is also constantly improving. In the past, we opened up wasteland in the mountains as we went, without fixed cultivated areas, and we did not know how to accumulate fertilizer and use manure, weed or process. We just sowed seeds in the spring and waited for the harvest in the summer. Now, these backward production methods have gradually changed, and grain output has increased year by year. The problem of grain shortage over the years has been gradually resolved, and some villages have even surplus grain households.

In terms of culture, education and health, before liberation, there were only a few schools run by churches in our Jingpo area. Now it has developed to more than fifty schools. Almost every township has a junior or complete primary school; and each school has at least one teacher from our own ethnic group. Health centers have also been generally established. In the six counties in the border area alone, there are thirty-six health institutions above the district level, with more than five hundred medical personnel. The government also widely provides free treatment to the people in the mountainous areas. In this way, diseases have decreased, the masses have begun to believe in science, and have initially understood some simple principles of hygiene. The number of people who kill cattle to sacrifice to ghosts and talk about superstition has also decreased. In short, very encouraging changes have taken place in our Jingpo area.

Representatives, that's not all! Now I want to report to you an even more important and greater change in our Jingpo people. That is, under the leadership of the Party and with the strong support of the state, we have begun to directly transition to socialist society, that is, we no longer regard land reform as a stage of revolutionary movement, but on the basis of uniting production, we adopt the policy of relying on the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants, uniting all working people, and uniting and transforming all ethnic upper-class figures who are connected with the working people. Through the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, we directly transition a social system that has entered private ownership but still has a strong primitive color to a socialist social system. This is determined according to the ethnic characteristics and regional characteristics of our region.

This is a Great Leap Forward in the relations of production and social system of our Jingpo people. We love this bright road pointed out by the Party for us. The experiment of implementing this direct transition began in 1954. In this year, we first piloted four agricultural cooperatives and succeeded. Therefore, this new relationship of production and new mode of production were accepted and loved by the Jingpo compatriots. By 1956, we affirmed this direction and further developed the cooperative movement. In this year, the number of agricultural cooperatives increased to eighty-six, and these cooperatives all increased production. Due to the Great Leap Forward in the social system, a Great Leap Forward in production also began to appear in many villages and agricultural cooperatives. For example, in the past, we could only harvest thirteen baskets of dry grain for every basket we planted (30 catties per basket), while the Mansa Agricultural Cooperative in Yingjiang County harvested nearly thirty baskets of grain for every basket of seed planted in seventy baskets of paddy fields from 1954 when the cooperative was established to 1956, more than double the previous yield. In addition, with the three sideline businesses of pig raising and lime burning carried out by their cooperative, the average income of each person in the cooperative reached more than ninety-four yuan in 1956. Such a large income is truly a miracle in our backward Jingpo people. This would not have been possible at all without organizing socialist agricultural production cooperatives.

Now the cooperative movement is even more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. By the end of 1957, the number of agricultural cooperatives run by our Jingpo and Lisu compatriots had increased from eighty-six in the previous year to two hundred and sixteen; in addition, more than half of the farmers had joined mutual aid groups.

In order to do a good job in the direct transition, according to the characteristics of the scattered mountain villages, we also organized seventeen "production and cultural stations" as working institutions to lead the direct transition. With this institution, it is of great help to us in completing the direct transition work, developing mountain production and construction, changing the backward appearance of the mountains, and helping.

In the direct transition work, we paid attention to the work of ethnic upper-class figures. In order to unite them and strive for them to also support and participate in this great change of direct transition to socialism, we have given them appropriate consideration in politics and economy. We also organized them to visit and study, to recognize the bright future of the nation, and to recognize that labor is glorious and exploitation is shameful. Now, this work has achieved great results. The majority of upper-class figures have voluntarily or expressed their willingness to give up exploitation, to give up personal interests for the benefit of national development, and expressed that "eating the people's food, we must do things for the people." Of course, there are also a very small number of ethnic upper-class figures and ethnic cadres who only value personal interests, ignore national interests, and even seriously local nationalism that opposes the leadership of the Party and opposes socialist transformation; in addition, there are also a small number of cadres who have relatively serious narrow ethnic sentiments. These all hinder the direct transition of our nation to socialism. For these people, we have patiently carried out persuasion and education in the past. We plan to give appropriate criticism to their wrong views in the future.

Representatives: Our Jingpo people love the beautiful and advanced social system of socialism. Leaping from a society with extremely strong primitive colors to a socialist society has laid the most solid foundation for the happiness and prosperity of our nation, and laid a good foundation. Although we will encounter many difficulties on the road to socialism, we believe that the Communist Party and the People's Government will guide us in the right direction, and we believe that the Han elder brothers and other advanced fraternal nations will continue to give us selfless help; we are also determined to build our backward primitive area into an advanced socialist area through learning and hard work. We thank the great Chinese Communist Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao for guiding us onto the bright road of socialism! We will definitely continue to implement one leap and another leap along this bright road!

    从原始社会末期直接过渡到社会主义
    景颇族实行社会制度大跃进
    雷春国代表畅谈景颇族地区发生的振奋人心的奇迹似的变化
    在这次会议上，听了李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告，我完全同意和衷心拥护。从今年的预算和计划草案的数字上看，我特别感到兴奋的是：在投资的安排上，重点是放在了建设方面，而每一项建设又都是为了在大跃进的形势下，在社会主义道路上大踏步前进，这是代表了全国各民族人民的最高利益的。这种有计划的宏伟的建设，这种造福人民的决心和伟大气魄，以及八年来已经取得的巨大成就，是只有在中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义的社会制度中，才能出现的。
    我来自祖国边疆云南德宏傣族、景颇族自治州，我是景颇族人，因此，对景颇族地区的变化感受更深。现在我在这里向大家谈谈景颇族地区的变化情况：
    各位代表都知道，一九五○年解放以前，我们景颇族人还过着原始社会末期的贫穷生活。景颇族的同胞们住在深山大林里，生产方法还是刀耕、火种，一年里要有半年以上的时间，靠采野果、掘野菜充饥。多少年代过去了，我们民族大多数人还没有点过油灯，没有盖过被子；夜晚烧起树皮当灯火，冬天烤火当被盖。我们没有文化，也不懂科学。人生了病，就用迷信办法，杀牛祭鬼，有的乡二百多户人家，一年里为了祭鬼而杀的牛就有一百五十多头，严重地影响了生产；而各种疾病照样蔓延，不断夺去我们民族的成人和婴儿的生命，人口在不断减少。
    政治上，解放前我们更没有丝毫权利。国民党反动派大汉族主义统治者们，叫我们“野人”、“化外之民”。他们的政府官吏和军队上山，到处捉鸡杀鸭，奸淫抢掠，杀人放火，无恶不做。同时，他们还挑拨我们和其他民族的关系，使我们各民族加深隔阂，互相仇杀。这些痛苦的事情，到今天想起来，还叫人伤心和愤恨。
    但是，解放后，我们景颇族地区变样了，并且大大变样了。
    首先，我们在政治上获得了当家做主、民族平等的权利。在毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，一九五三年七月我们成立了德宏自治区，行使了各项自治权利；一九五六年我们又根据宪法规定的原则改建为德宏傣族、景颇族自治州。党和人民政府对我们少数民族的生产和生活也非常关心。八年来，每年都发放巨额的山区生产无偿补助款、贷款和救济款，帮助我们解决耕牛、农具、种子和口粮等各方面的困难。在汉族老大哥和政府干部的具体帮助下，我们景颇族的生产技术也在不断改进。过去我们山区开荒是随开随丢，没有固定耕作区，也不知道积肥用粪、除草加工，只是春天播下种子，就等夏天收割；现在，这些落后生产方法已经逐渐改变，粮食产量一年比一年增加了，历年来的缺粮问题，已经逐步得到解决，有的乡寨还出现了余粮户。
    在文教卫生方面，解放前我们景颇族地区只有几所教会办的小学，现在已经发展到五十多所，几乎每个乡都有一所初级小学或完全小学；而每所学校也都至少有一名本民族的教师。卫生所也普遍建立起来了，光是边区的六个县就有区以上卫生机构三十六个，卫生医疗人员五百余名。政府还广泛地对山区人民实行免费治疗。这样，疾病减少了，群众开始相信科学，并初步懂得了讲卫生的一些简单道理，杀牛祭鬼讲迷信的人也减少了。总之，我们景颇族地区已经发生了十分振奋人心的变化。
    各位代表，这还不算！现在我还要报告我们景颇族的一个更重要更伟大的变化，这就是在党的领导下，在国家的大力扶植下，我们开始了向社会主义社会的直接过渡，就是不再把土地改革当作一种革命运动阶段来进行，而是在团结生产的基础上，采取依靠广大的贫苦农民，团结一切劳动人民，团结和改造一切与劳动人民有联系的民族上层人物的方针，通过互助合作的道路，把一种虽已进入私有制但仍存在着较浓厚的原始色彩的社会制度，直接过渡到社会主义的社会制度。这是根据我们这个地区的民族特点和地区特点来确定的。
    这是我们景颇族在生产关系和社会制度上的一个大跃进。我们热爱党给我们指引的这条光明大道。试验实行这种直接过渡，是从一九五四年开始的。这一年，我们先试办了四个农业社，而且办成功了；于是，这个新的生产关系、新的生产方式，被景颇族同胞们接受了，热爱了。到一九五六年，我们肯定了这个方向，进一步发展了合作化运动；这一年，农业社发展到八十六个，这些社都增加了生产。由于社会制度的大跃进，很多村、寨的农业社也开始出现了生产的大跃进。比如，过去我们种一箩旱谷只能收到十三箩（每箩三十斤），而盈江县的蛮撒农业社从一九五四年办社到一九五六年，开水田七十箩种，每箩种却收到谷子将近三十箩，比过去增产一倍多。加上他们社开展的养猪、烧石灰等三项副业，全社每个人在一九五六年平均收入达到九十四块多钱。这样多的收入，在我们生产落后的景颇族，真说得上是奇迹。如果不是组织社会主义的农业生产合作社，就根本办不到。
    现在合作化运动是更深入人心了。到一九五七年底，我们景颇族和傈僳族同胞办的农业社，已经由上一年的八十六个发展到二百一十六个；另外，还有一半以上农户加入了互助组。
    为了做好直接过渡工作，根据山区村户分散的特点，我们还组织了十七个“生产文化站”，做为领导直接过渡的工作机构。有了这个机构，对于我们完成直接过渡工作和发展山区生产建设、改变山区落后面貌，帮助是很大的。
    在直接过渡工作上，我们注意了民族上层人物的工作。为了团结他们，争取他们也能拥护和参加向社会主义直接过渡这个伟大的变革，在政治上、经济上都对他们进行了适当的照顾。还组织他们参观、学习，认清民族的光明前途，认识到劳动光荣和剥削可耻。现在，这个工作已经取得很大成绩。多数的上层人物，已经自愿或表示愿意放弃剥削，愿意为民族发展的利益放弃个人利益，表示“吃人民的饭，要为人民做事情”。当然，也还有极少数的民族上层人物和民族干部，只看重个人利益，漠视民族利益，甚至反对党的领导反对社会主义改造的严重的地方民族主义；另外也还有少部分干部存在着比较严重的狭隘的民族情绪。这些都阻碍着我们民族向社会主义的直接过渡。对于这些人，过去我们曾经耐心地进行了说服教育，对他们的错误观点，我们拟在今后给以适当的批判。
    各位代表：我们景颇族人民是热爱社会主义这个美好的先进的社会制度的。从原始色彩尚极浓厚的社会一步跨跃到社会主义社会，就是给我们民族的幸福和繁荣扎下了最牢固的根基，打下了良好的基础。虽然，在向社会主义前进的道路上，我们还会遇到很多困难，可是，我们相信共产党和人民政府会指引我们正确的方向，相信汉族老大哥和其他先进的兄弟民族会继续给我们以无私的帮助；我们也有决心经过学习和努力，把我们这个落后的原始地区建设成为一个先进的社会主义地区。我们感谢伟大的中国共产党和敬爱的领袖毛主席引导我们走上了社会主义的光明大道！我们一定沿着这条光明大道，继续不断地实行一个跃进、又一个跃进！
    以上发言如有不当之处，请各位代表指正。
