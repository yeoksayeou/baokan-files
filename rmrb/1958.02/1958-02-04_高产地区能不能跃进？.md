Can High-Yield Areas Leap Forward?
    Mo Yuanren Hong Tao
    The Songjiang and Suzhou Special Districts of Jiangsu Province, located in the Taihu Lake area, have historically been known as the "land of fish and rice," boasting high grain yields. During the First Five-Year Plan, grain production here gradually increased, with an average yield of 575.8 jin per mu last year, 76% higher than the average yield in Jiangsu Province. However, the rate of increase in grain production here has been slow, with an average annual increase rate of only 3.49%, less than that of the Lixiahe area and the Xuhuai Plain. If production continues to increase at a rate of 3.49% during the Second Five-Year Plan, it will be impossible to achieve the target of 800 jin per mu set in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) by 1967. Many counties in Guangdong, Hubei, Zhejiang, Sichuan and other provinces have achieved yields of over 1,000 jin, while the natural conditions in the Taihu Lake area of Jiangsu Province are not worse, and may even be slightly better, but there is not a single county or district with a yield of 800 jin.

    Can we leap forward? This is an important issue that urgently needs to be resolved by the representatives attending and observing the Second Session of the Third Congress of the Communist Party of China, Jiangsu Provincial Committee. After more than a month of debate, these representatives unanimously agreed that the issue of whether or not to leap forward depends first and foremost on whether or not the leading cadres dare to leap forward, and that the conservative idea of "reaching the peak of production" is a stumbling block to daring to leap forward. After analysis, the representatives believed that the political reflection of this "reaching the peak of production" mentality is the struggle between the two roads of whether or not the Party should lead production. During the airing of views and debates at the meeting, it was revealed that a few people had a tendency to oppose the Party's leadership in agricultural production. A leading comrade in one county extremely and erroneously vilified the provincial Party committee's leadership over production as "thousand-year-unchanging, ten-thousand-year-unchanging dogmas," negating the leadership of the higher Party committee. Still others, while not openly negating the Party's ability to lead production, adopted a passive and perfunctory attitude in implementing the instructions of the higher Party committee, greatly reducing the effectiveness of some of the increased production measures put forward by the higher Party committee. When Zhenze County promoted double-cropping rice last year, some townships disobeyed orders, turning the late-season rice into ratooning rice, resulting in reduced production losses. The comrades attending the meeting analyzed the ideological roots of this tendency, which came from two aspects: one was the reflection of the dissatisfaction of some well-to-do middle peasants in the countryside with the Party. They were accustomed to the self-sufficient life governed by the natural laws of the small-scale peasant economy, and often shouted that "production does not need the Party to lead," and some cadres became the spokespersons of these well-to-do middle peasants; the other was that some grassroots cadres had various kinds of individualism, believing that "production is a soft task, and the merits and demerits cannot be seen for a while; unlike the unified purchase and sale, which is a hard task, and cannot be shirked." Facts have proved that if agricultural production does not have the Party's leadership or weakens the Party's leadership, it will not only be impossible to leap forward, but also cause significant losses. Zhenze County, for example, in 1956, the Party committee grasped the leadership of production, turning more than 20,000 mu of the county's more than 40,000 mu of single-cropping fields into double-cropping fields, which achieved a large increase in production. In 1957, the leadership of production was relaxed, and the remaining more than 20,000 mu of single-cropping fields were not converted into double-cropping fields, resulting in a loss of at least nearly two million jin of grain.

    Secondly, this idea of reaching the peak of production is also reflected in the struggle between advanced and backward thinking. During the airing of views and debates, many representatives from low-yield and medium-yield areas often used poor objective conditions as an excuse for their relaxed leadership. And some representatives from areas with higher yields often only looked back and not forward, believing that "high-yield areas can only increase production slightly, not greatly, and no matter how high the yield is, they cannot jump out of the prosperous circle of 1955." They said things like "experience in recent years has proved that it is impossible to take big steps in agricultural production," "agricultural production fluctuates greatly and can only be gradual, not leap forward," "it seems that agricultural production has reached a certain height, and it is difficult to leap forward again, unlike their low-yield areas which have great potential and are easy to increase production," and so on. The emergence of these ideas is mainly due to their failure to see the requirements of the great leap forward situation, and their failure to see the enormous power released by labor, land, capital, and livestock and farm implements from the shackles of the small-scale peasant economy after collectivization. Therefore, they are satisfied with the status quo of "high-yield areas" and revel in 500 jin or 600 jin.

    Has the Taihu Lake area already reached the peak of production, making it impossible to move forward by leaps and bounds? Definitely not. According to incomplete statistics at the meeting, among the more than 4,000 agricultural cooperatives in Suzhou Special District, 127 cooperatives have already achieved an annual grain yield of more than 800 jin per mu. Among them, the Xinjian Cooperative in Wu County and the Xinhua Cooperative in Taicang have yields of about 1,000 jin per mu. More than 50,000 mu of double-cropping rice in Fengxian County has an average yield of more than 800 jin per mu, and Jinshan County has more than 1,000 mu of 1,000-jin fields. These facts of high yield prove that the yield in high-yield areas has not reached the peak. Not only is scattered high yield possible, but also large-scale high yield is entirely possible.

    Again, this idea of reaching the peak of production also reflects the ideological struggle between poor methods and rich methods, and between relying on the masses and not relying on the masses. Some grassroots cadres in Wuxi County, regarding the county's proposed measures to cut green grass, sweep garbage, and use various methods to increase fertilizer accumulation, said, "These are poor methods for production in the northern Jiangsu area, and they won't work here." What is the reality? Not only does the reality in our country require us to use poor methods to produce, to manage cooperatives diligently and frugally, and to use the method of looking downward and relying on the masses to overcome difficulties; but many facts that have emerged in recent years have proved that poor methods of production can not only increase production, but also enable production to make a great leap forward. For example, Jinshan County relies on substitute feed to achieve an average of three and a half pigs per household in the county. Jiangyin County launched a mass movement for self-sufficiency in funds, fertilizers, and feed this year, which basically solved the difficulties of lacking funds, fertilizers, and feed. Moreover, the green manure area and output of the Suzhou and Songjiang Special Districts are large and high, which can solve the fertilizer needs of many mu of fields. As long as we rely closely on the masses, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome.

    The right-leaning conservative thoughts constituted by the above three aspects heavily weigh on the heads of cadres in "high-yield areas," making their steps heavy and their actions slow on the road to increased production. The comrades attending the meeting deeply exposed and criticized the above-mentioned right-leaning conservative ideas from behind this status quo, analyzed the favorable conditions for increased production in the Taihu Lake area, and the Suzhou and Songjiang Special Districts are determined to achieve the target of 800 jin of grain per mu five years ahead of schedule, striving to maintain the honor of high-yield areas. Among them, Jinshan, Jiangyin, Fengxian, Shanghai, and Zhenze counties requested to achieve the target of 800 jin in 1958.

　　高产地区能不能跃进？
　　莫远人　洪滔
    位于太湖地区的江苏省松江、苏州专区，是历来号称“鱼米之乡”的粮食高产地区。第一个五年计划期间，这里的粮食产量是在逐步上升，去年平均亩产五百七十五点八斤，比江苏全省平均产量高出76％。但这里粮食产量上升速度却是缓慢的，平均每年递增率只有3.49％，增产幅度没有里下河地区高，也不及徐淮平原。如果第二个五年计划期间，仍按3.49％的递增率来增产，那么到1967年，就根本不可能达到农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的亩产八百斤的指标。广东、湖北、浙江、四川等省都出现了不少千斤县，而江苏太湖地区自然条件并不比这些省差，甚至还略好一些，但却没有一个八百斤的县、区。
    能不能跃进？这是摆在出席和列席中共江苏省第三届代表大会第二次会议的太湖地区代表面前一个急待解决的重要课题。经过一个多月的争论，这些代表一致认为能不能跃进的问题，首先决定于领导人员敢不敢跃进，而“增产到顶”的保守思想又是敢于跃进的绊脚石。代表们经过分析之后认为，这种“增产到顶”思想在政治上的反映，是要不要党领导生产的两条道路斗争问题。在会议的鸣放争辩过程中，揭露出少数人在农业生产上有不要党的领导的倾向。有一个县的领导同志极端错误地诬蔑省委对生产的领导是“千年不变，万年不烂的教条”，否定了上级党委的领导；还有一些人虽不公开否定党能领导生产，但在执行上级党委指示的行动中间却采取了阳奉阴违、眼开眼闭的态度，使上级党委明确提出的一些增产措施，在贯彻的时候大打折扣。震泽县去年推广双季稻时，有些乡阳奉阴违，把后季稻改成再生稻，招致了减产的损失。到会的同志分析了产生这种倾向的思想根源，来自二个方面，一个是农村里有一部分富裕中农对党不满情绪的反映，他们习惯于小农经济的自然法则支配下的自给自足的生活，经常在叫嚷“生产用不到党来领导”，有些干部就成为这部分富裕中农的代言人；另一个是有些基层干部存在着各种各样的个人主义，他们认为“生产是软任务，成绩好坏一时看不出；不比统购统销是硬任务，偷不得懒”。事实证明：农业生产如果没有党的领导或者减弱了党的领导，不仅不能跃进，还会造成重大损失。仍然以震泽县为例，1956年党委抓紧了生产领导，使全县四万多亩一熟田中的二万余亩变成了二熟田，就取得了大量增产的效果。1957年放松了生产领导，其余的二万多亩一熟田没有改成二熟，至少损失近二百万斤粮食。
    其次，这种增产到顶的思想还反映在先进和落后思想的斗争上。在鸣放争辩过程中，许多低产和平产地区的代表，往往以客观条件不好为自己放松领导作辩护。而有些产量较高地区的代表又往往只向后看、不向前看，认为“高产地区只能小增产，不能大增产，产量再高也不能跳出1955年的丰产圈子。”说甚么“几年来的经验证明，农业生产上要跨大步子是不行的”，“农业生产波动性大，只能渐进，不能跃进”，“看来农业生产到了一定高度，再要跃进就难了，不比他们低产地区潜力大，容易增产”等等。这些思想的产生，主要是由于他们看不清大跃进的形势要求，看不到合作化以后，劳力、土地、资金、耕畜农具从小农经济束缚中间解放出来的巨大力量，因而就满足于“高产地区”的现状，陶醉于五百斤、六百斤。
    是不是太湖地区已经增产到顶，因而无法大踏步前进了呢？肯定不是。据会上不完全的统计，苏州专区四千多个农业社中，已有一百二十七个社每亩年产粮食在八百斤以上，其中如吴县新建社，太仓新华社，每亩产量已在千斤左右。奉贤县五万多亩双季稻，平均亩产八百多斤，金山县出现一千多亩千斤田。这些高额丰产的事实证明：高产地区产量并没有到顶。不但零星高产是可能的，而且大面积高产也是完全可能的。
    再次，这种增产到顶思想也反映着穷办法和富办法、依靠群众和不依靠群众的思想斗争。无锡县的一些基层干部，对县里提出割青草、扫垃圾，用各种办法增积肥料的措施，说“这是苏北地区搞生产的穷办法，我们这里不行。”事实怎么样呢？不但我们国家的现实情况要求用穷办法来生产，用勤俭办社的方针来搞生产，用眼睛向下依靠群众的办法来克服困难；而几年来出现的许多事实，证明穷办法生产不但可能增产，而且完全能使生产大跃进的。例如金山县依靠代饲料，做到全县每户养猪三头半。江阴县今年开展了群众性的资金、肥料、饲料三自给运动，就基本上解决了缺资金、缺肥料、缺饲料的困难。而且苏、松两个专区绿肥面积大、产量高，可解决很多亩田的肥料需要，只要紧紧依靠群众，没有克服不了的困难。
    由以上三方面构成的右倾保守思想，沉重地压在“高产地区”的干部头上，使他们在增产的道路上表现得步子沉重，行动缓慢。到会同志们深入地从这种现状背后，揭发批判了上述种种右倾保守思想，分析了太湖地区的增产有利条件，苏、松两专区都决心提前五年实现亩产粮食八百斤的指标，力争保持高产地区的荣誉。其中金山、江阴、奉贤、上海、震泽等五个县，并要求在1958年就实现八百斤的指标。
