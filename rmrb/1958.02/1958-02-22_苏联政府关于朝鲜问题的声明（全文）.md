Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 20th (TASS dispatch): Soviet Government Statement

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on February 5 concerning the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. This statement proposed: the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, from North and South Korea; free all-Korean elections under the supervision of an organization composed of representatives of neutral countries after the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea; consultations on an equal basis to discuss economic and cultural links between the two parts of Korea; and the reduction of the armed forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea to a minimum in the near future, respectively.

The Government of the People's Republic of China immediately responded to this request. On February 7, it stated that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea on a regular basis, and expressed its willingness to discuss with the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. It also raised the issue of requiring the governments of the United States and other countries currently stationing troops in South Korea to take similar measures and withdraw their troops as well.

The joint statement issued by the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 19 announced that the Chinese People's Volunteers agreed to this proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China and decided to withdraw from Korea in batches before the end of 1958, with the first batch to be completed before April 30, 1958.

The Soviet Government believes that this new initiative by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China is of extremely great significance, and also considers it to be one of the most important measures aimed at easing international tensions, strengthening international trust, and consolidating peace.

Thanks to the efforts of the Korean and Chinese peoples to resolve the Korean issue through peaceful means (efforts which have been supported by the Soviet Union and many other peace-loving countries), the bloodshed in Korea ceased in July 1953, and an armistice agreement was signed. To this day, this agreement still plays an important role in maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission for the Korean Armistice, composed of representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland, has made no small contribution to ensuring the armistice.

However, the situation in Korea cannot but be disturbing. Although the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward many constructive proposals and made many efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, Korea has not yet been unified to this day due to the obstruction of the South Korean authorities, who are supported by the United States.

In the summer of 1957, the United States violated the important provision of the armistice agreement prohibiting the introduction of weapons into Korea, armed the South Korean army with new weapons, and transformed South Korea into a nuclear base. These practices will never promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Moreover, these practices will only sharpen the situation in Korea. The Soviet government is convinced that all countries that genuinely wish to ease international tensions, including in the Far East, cannot but be concerned about this situation.

The Soviet government remains convinced that the Korean issue cannot be resolved through foreign interference in Korean affairs. The question of restoring Korean national unity can only be resolved by the Koreans themselves through the gradual rapprochement of North and South Korea.

The proposals of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the peaceful reunification of Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, as well as the statement of the government of the People's Republic of China on this issue, open up a new path for resolving the Korean issue, which is conducive to consolidating peace in Korea and eliminating the source of war in this region.

These proposals are in line with the increasingly strong desire of the people of all countries to ease international tensions and to establish an atmosphere of international trust and peaceful cooperation.

If the United States and other countries with troops stationed in South Korea sincerely hope to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea and consolidate peace in the Far East, then why would they not support the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China? There is no doubt that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea will certainly bring a situation of tranquility to Korea, help establish the necessary links between the two parts of Korea, thereby creating preconditions for the gradual unification of Korea and promoting the easing of tensions in the Far East.

Therefore, the proposal of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to hold relevant negotiations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea on an equal basis (including the issue of establishing economic and cultural links between North and South Korea) is of particular significance. The Soviet government believes that this proposal of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea can serve as a solid basis for establishing and developing links between the two parts of Korea.

The rapprochement between North and South Korea would be easier, and the maintenance of peace in Korea could be guaranteed, if the two governments concluded a peace agreement, undertook the obligation not to use force to resolve disputes, if an agreement were reached on a significant reduction in the armed forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea, and if they declared that they would not allow the deployment of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons on their territories.

Considering that Korea has been divided for more than twelve years, and that there is no necessary trust in the relations between the two parts of Korea, the Soviet government believes that it is appropriate to convene a conference of relevant countries to discuss some measures to promote rapprochement between the two parts of Korea.

The Soviet government fully supports the measures of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, and expresses the hope that the United States and other countries with troops stationed in South Korea will give due consideration to the initiatives of the governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, withdraw their troops from South Korea, thereby promoting the further health of the situation in the Far East, promoting the consolidation of peace in the Korean region, and creating preconditions for the restoration of Korean national unity on a peaceful and democratic basis.

### 苏联政府关于朝鲜问题的声明（全文）

    苏联政府关于朝鲜问题的声明（全文）
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社莫斯科20日电：苏联政府声明
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府2月5日就一切外国军队撤出朝鲜和和平统一朝鲜问题发表了声明。这个声明中建议：包括中国人民志愿军在内的一切外国军队同时撤出南、北朝鲜；在外国军队撤出朝鲜后在中立国代表组成的机构的监督下举行全朝鲜的自由选举；在对等的基础上进行协商，讨论朝鲜两部分之间的经济和文化联系的问题；朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜在最近期间各自将武装部队的人数裁减到最低限度。
    中华人民共和国政府立即响应了这个要求。它在2月7日声称，一切外国军队都应当定期撤出朝鲜，并且表示愿意同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府讨论从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军的问题。它还提出这样一个问题：要求目前派有军队驻扎在南朝鲜的美国和其他国家的政府采取同样措施，也撤出它们的军队。
    中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国两国政府2月19日发表的联合声明宣布，中国人民志愿军同意中华人民共和国政府的这一建议，并且决定在1958年年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜，第一批将在1958年4月30日以前撤完。
    苏联政府认为，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国这一新的倡议具有极其重大的意义，并且也认为这是旨在缓和国际紧张局势、加强国际信任和巩固和平的极其重要的措施之一。
    由于朝中人民为通过和平道路解决朝鲜问题而作的努力（这种努力得到苏联和许多其他爱好和平国家的支持），朝鲜的流血在1953年7月停止了，并且签订了停战协定。直到目前，这一协定对于维持朝鲜半岛的和平还起着重要作用。在保证停战方面，由波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典、瑞士的代表所组成的中立国朝鲜停战监察委员会有着不小的功绩。
    然而，朝鲜局势不能不令人感到不安。虽然朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为和平解决朝鲜问题提出了许多建设性建议并且作了许多努力，但是由于受到美国支持的南朝鲜当局对此加以阻挠，朝鲜直到今天尚未统一。
    1957年夏季，美国破坏停战协定关于不准向朝鲜运入武器这一重要条款，用新式武器武装南朝鲜军队并且变南朝鲜为原子基地，这些做法绝不会促进朝鲜问题的和平解决。不仅如此，这些做法只会使朝鲜的局势尖锐化。苏联政府确信，凡是真正希望缓和包括远东在内的国际紧张局势的国家都不能不关心这种情况。
    苏联政府仍然确信，朝鲜问题不可能通过外国对朝鲜事务的干涉而获得解决。恢复朝鲜民族统一的问题，只能由朝鲜人自己通过南北朝鲜逐渐接近的办法解决。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于和平统一朝鲜和一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的建议，以及中华人民共和国政府关于这个问题的声明，开辟了一个解决朝鲜问题的新的途径，有利于巩固朝鲜和平和消除这一地区的战争策源地。
    这些建议符合各国人民对缓和国际紧张局势、对建立国际信任与和平合作的气氛的日益强烈的愿望。
    如果派有军队驻扎在南朝鲜的美国和其他国家真诚希望促进朝鲜的和平统一和巩固远东的和平，那么为什么它们会不支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的建议呢？毫无疑问，从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队一定会给朝鲜带来安宁的局势，有助于建立朝鲜两部分之间的必要的联系，从而为朝鲜的逐步统一创造先决条件，促进远东紧张局势的缓和。
    因此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府重新提出的关于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜之间在对等的基础上举行有关的谈判（其中包括建立南北朝鲜之间的经济和文化联系的问题）的建议具有特殊的意义。苏联政府认为，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这项建议可以作为建立和发展朝鲜两部分之间的联系的巩固基础。
    如果两个政府缔结和平协定，承担不使用武力解决争端问题的义务，如果达成关于大大裁减朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜的武装部队的协定，如果它们声明，不允许在自己的领土上设置核武器和火箭武器的话，那么北朝鲜和南朝鲜之间的接近就容易了，朝鲜和平的维护也就可以得到保证了。
    考虑到朝鲜的分裂已有十二年多，朝鲜两部分之间的关系中没有必要的信任，因此，苏联政府认为，召开有关国家会议来讨论一些促使朝鲜两部分之间接近的措施是适宜的。
    苏联政府完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国两国的措施，并且表示希望有军队驻扎在南朝鲜的美国和其他国家政府给予朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国两国政府的倡议以应有的重视，把它们的军队撤出南朝鲜，从而促使远东局势进一步健康化，促进朝鲜地区和平的巩固，以及为在和平民主基础上恢复朝鲜的民族统一创造先决条件。
