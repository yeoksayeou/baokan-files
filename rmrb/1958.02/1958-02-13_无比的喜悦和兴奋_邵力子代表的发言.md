I completely agree with and wholeheartedly endorse the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Director Wu Yuzhang, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

The convening of this congress: at a time when the nationwide rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle have achieved decisive victories; at a time when the first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy has been overfulfilled and we are entering the second Five-Year Plan; at a time when the international situation is entering a new turning point favorable to the socialist camp, fills me with immeasurable joy.

At this congress, the government has put forward the draft state budget for 1958 and the draft national economic plan. Our country is able to make excellent arrangements and detailed plans for the budget and national economic plan for the year at the beginning of the year, and convene the National People's Congress to discuss them. This seems ordinary, but it is actually a remarkable event. It was unimaginable in the past, and it will be done every year from now on. This not only proves the great achievements of our country's financial and economic work but also embodies the superiority of the socialist system, which makes me feel even more excited.

I have always kept firmly in mind Chairman Mao's words of 1949: "There are difficulties, there are solutions, and there is hope." Chairman Mao spoke these three sentences during the meeting of the Central People's Government Committee to discuss the national revenue and expenditure budget for 1950. Chairman Mao earnestly told everyone at the time, "Our financial situation is difficult, and we must explain the difficulties to the people. We must not hide them, but we must also explain to the people that we do have ways to overcome the difficulties, that our cause is hopeful, and that the future is bright." Chairman Mao also clearly instructed: "Our situation will get better year by year. It is estimated that next year (1950) will be better than this year. Within three to five years, our economy can be fully restored, and within ten to eight years, our economy can achieve great development." Chairman Mao's estimate was very correct. Our financial and economic situation has indeed improved year by year. In three years, we restored the damage to the economy before liberation, and in eight years, the economy achieved such great development as it has today. This is entirely because the Party and the government have indeed found ways to overcome difficulties, which has given the people of the whole country the confidence and courage not to bow to difficulties and to advance towards the great socialist leap forward with hope.

Please allow me to recall my speech at the First National People's Congress. I said, "I believe that under the shining light of the Constitution drafted under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country will strengthen unity, strengthen vigilance, and advance towards the goal of socialism. Any difficulties can be overcome." When I said "strengthen vigilance" at the time, I meant that "a very small number of people dare not openly oppose socialism, but it cannot be said that they do not want to obstruct and sabotage it in secret." Facts have proved that a handful of Rightist elements have indeed moved from secretly obstructing and sabotaging the socialist cause led by the Party to openly and frantically attacking it. Precisely because the broad masses of people are determined to defend the socialist Constitution, and because our Constitution can indeed guarantee that the socialist cause will not be harmed, once the broad masses of people rise up to carry out a just struggle, the Rightist elements will disintegrate, collapse, and fail completely. From the solemn handling of the Rightist elements at this congress and the stern condemnation of the Rightist elements in the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo and Director Wu Yuzhang, I am even more convinced that the socialist Constitution cannot be undermined by anyone. This great victory on the political and ideological fronts will surely greatly promote the socialist cause.

When I said "overcome difficulties" at the time, I meant that our country's large land area and large population were originally enough to be proud of, but because we were lagging behind in many aspects in the past, there were still many difficulties left before us. Because of the large land area and uneven climate across the country, some areas are always affected by partial disasters every year, especially floods, which are the most harmful. I hoped that the government would further strengthen the water conservancy work that it has always attached importance to, but at the time I did not fully recognize the great potential of the masses in building water conservancy projects. Because of the large population, the problem of all school-age children entering school cannot be solved in a short period of time. I hoped that people's governments at all levels and agricultural cooperatives in various places would make more efforts in this regard, and at the same time, I also hoped that people with knowledge and financial resources in society would also help the country overcome this difficulty. Now it seems that, thanks to the correct call of the Party and the government and the staunch struggle of the people of the whole country, in terms of water conservancy, considerable achievements have been made in the past few years, which have reduced the continuous drought and flood disasters to varying degrees, and grain production has increased year after year. At present, the whole country is entering an unprecedented upsurge in the construction of farmland water conservancy. Every day, more than 100 million farmers across the country are engaged in labor on the water conservancy project front. This water conservancy construction movement is continuing to develop vigorously. It can be concluded that the benefits of this year's water conservancy projects will be a powerful guarantee for achieving or exceeding the target of 392 billion catties of grain this year; Article 5 of the "Revised Draft of the National Agricultural Development Program" regarding water conservancy requirements can certainly be realized ahead of schedule. In terms of education, thanks to the efforts of the government and the people, the problem of all school-age children entering school is also being gradually resolved. The number of students in primary schools has increased year by year, and mass education has also made great progress. Because the birth rate of children is increasing year by year, and the country must use the main part of its financial resources for economic construction, it cannot but rely more on agricultural cooperatives and private individuals to run education to help the country overcome this difficulty. Article 31 of the Revised Draft of the National Agricultural Development Program stipulates that "in eliminating illiteracy and developing rural cultural and educational work, we should vigorously promote mass collective education and allow private education in order to gradually popularize primary school education." In this budget and economic plan report, it can be seen that the country is not only using considerable financial resources to run water conservancy and education but also vigorously developing the direction of mass water management and mass education. These fully embody the Party's consistent good method of relying on the strength of the masses to overcome difficulties, which is very encouraging.

I said at the First Congress, "A large population is a good thing, but in an environment with many difficulties, there should also be some limits," and therefore quoted Lenin's words, "pointing out that the working class is absolutely incompatible with Neo-Malthusianism and will never hinder us from demanding measures to spread medical theories about contraception, etc." Because our country has never had the habit of contraception, and contraception conflicts with the traditional idea that the more children and grandchildren the better, it was difficult to promote the work of birth control in the early stage. However, thanks to the attention of the Party and the government and the adoption of appropriate measures, this difficulty is also being gradually overcome. The directive on birth control issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in March 1955 stated: "Birth control is a major policy issue related to the lives of the broad masses of people. Under the current historical conditions, for the benefit of the country, the family, and the new generation, our Party is in favor of appropriate birth control." In September 1956, Premier Zhou Enlai said in his report to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "In order to protect women and children, to educate the next generation well, and to benefit the health and prosperity of the nation, we are in favor of appropriate birth control. The health departments should cooperate with relevant parties to conduct appropriate publicity on birth control and take effective measures." Last year, the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program was proposed, and Article 29 clearly stipulated that "except in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, in all densely populated areas, publicity and promotion of birth control should be carried out to promote planned childbearing." After this series of advocacy and promotion by the Party and the government, the necessity of family planning has been recognized by the broad masses of people. Not long ago, the resolution made by the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress stated that "we should actively promote birth control and advocate planned childbearing, and strive to gradually reduce the birth rate of the city from the current 40 per thousand to below 20 per thousand during the Second Five-Year Plan period." Not only is Shanghai doing this, but major cities across the country are also moving in this direction. In the past, it was generally believed that birth control could not be discussed in rural areas, but now the situation has also changed greatly. The Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Shuangfeng County, Hunan Province, has formulated a birth planning plan to reduce the population growth rate from 4 percent to 1.8 percent. The Wanjiazhuang Village in Wanghai Township, Wendeng County, Shandong Province, has paid attention to contraception publicity for a year, which has enabled young and middle-aged women to exert their labor potential. This year, the number of people participating in labor for a long time has more than doubled compared with last year. In this congress, Delegate Li Neng from Yunnan Province cited the fact that after the members of the Shangsuan Agricultural Cooperative in Jinning County understood the principle of family planning, those with many children ligated their vas deferens, and many people bought condoms. The above examples are all clear proof that awakened farmers will welcome family planning. At the same time, farmers will also accept the advice to postpone marriage. On the recent hot and busy water conservancy project front, some young men and women have voluntarily agreed to postpone their weddings; however, there are still very few people who get married privately before the age stipulated in the Marriage Law without being stopped, which is an absolutely intolerable phenomenon! An article in the first issue of this year's "China Youth" entitled "Stop Illegal Early Marriage" clearly explains the reasons, but it does not explain how to stop it. People want to ask, can illegal early marriage be stopped? My answer is yes. The awareness of the vast number of farmers has been greatly improved. It is only necessary to focus on publicizing Article 29 of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program in the socialist debate in rural areas, compare the benefits of family planning and the harms of giving birth too early, too much, and too closely, and explain them thoroughly. At the same time, comprehensively check whether there is any connivance of illegal early marriage in the rural rectification movement. If there is, publicly criticize and correct it, and it can be guaranteed that no one will commit illegal early marriage again. However, it can only be said that the work of family planning has had a good start, and many methods must still be used to overcome the various difficulties that stand in the way. I hope that the relevant departments and all the people will make more efforts in this regard.

In the past eight years, our country's situation has indeed improved year by year, and 1958 will be much better than 1957. In the past eight years, we have also encountered many difficulties, and some difficulties have been very serious, but because the Party and the government do have ways to overcome every difficulty, and after each difficulty is overcome, there is a better hope before us, and at the same time, there will be new difficulties. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country give full play to their enthusiasm and implement the method of combining leadership and the masses. Any difficulty can be overcome. We should have a hundredfold confidence and hope and move towards the road of socialism.

I propose that the Congress approve the 1958 budget, the economic plan, the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, and the relevant reports. With immeasurable joy and excitement, I wish the Congress success!

### 无比的喜悦和兴奋  邵力子代表的发言

    无比的喜悦和兴奋
    邵力子代表的发言
    我完全同意并衷心拥护李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、吴玉章主任和彭真副委员长的报告。
    这次大会的召开：是在全民性的整风运动和反右派斗争取得决定性胜利的时候；是在发展国民经济第一个五年计划超额完成后进入第二个五年计划的时候；是在国际形势进入有利于社会主义阵营的新转折点的时候；使我感到无比的喜悦。
    这次大会，政府提出了一九五八年国家预算草案和国民经济计划草案，我们国家能够在年度开始的时候，对于当年的预算和国民经济计划，作出极好的安排，订出详细的方案，召开全国人民代表大会来讨论，这看似平常，实际是一件了不起的大事，在从前是决不能想像的，今后每年都将这样做。这不仅证明我国财政经济工作的伟大成就，而且体现了社会主义制度的优越性，更使我感到无比的兴奋。
    我一直牢牢记着一九四九年毛主席“有困难的、有办法的、有希望的”的话。毛主席是在中央人民政府委员会讨论一九五○年全国收支概算的时候讲这三句话的。毛主席当时谆谆向大家讲“我们的财政情况是有困难的，我们必须向人民说明困难所在，不要隐瞒，同时也必须向人民说明我们确实有办法克服困难，我们的事业是有希望的，前途是光明的。”毛主席又曾明确指示：“我们的情况会一年比一年好起来，预计明年（一九五○年）要比今年好。在三年五年的时间内，我们的经济可以完全恢复，在十年八年的时间内，我们的经济就可以得到巨大的发展。”毛主席的估计十分正确，我们的财经情况确是一年比一年好，三年就恢复了经济在解放以前的创伤，八年就使经济得到现在这样的巨大发展。这完全是党和政府确实有办法克服困难，才使全国人民有信心有勇气，不向困难低头，满怀希望地向社会主义大跃进。
    请允许我回顾我在全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的发言。我曾说：“我相信在毛主席领导起草的宪法光辉照耀下，全国人民加强团结，加强警惕，一致向社会主义的目标前进，任何困难都是可以克服的。”我当时说“加强警惕”，是指“极少数人不敢公开反对社会主义，但不能说他们不想在暗地里阻挠破坏。”事实证明：一小撮右派分子对于党领导的社会主义事业，确从暗地里的阻挠破坏进而公然猖狂进攻。正因为广大人民决心捍卫社会主义的宪法，而我们的宪法又确能保证社会主义事业不受侵害，一经广大人民起来进行正义的斗争，右派分子就分化瓦解全盘失败了。从这次大会对于右派分子的严肃处理，李先念、薄一波两位副总理和吴玉章主任在报告里对于右派分子的严正指斥，我更确信社会主义的宪法不是任何人所能破坏，这一政治战线上思想战线上的伟大胜利，必将对于社会主义事业大大地起促进作用。
    我当时说“克服困难”是指我国土地大、人口多、原是足以自豪，但由于过去在各方面多是落后，留在我们面前的困难也是不少。由于土地大，全国气候不齐，每年总要有些地区受到偏灾，尤以水灾为害最烈，我因希望政府再加强一向重视的水利工作，但我当时并没有充分认识群众兴修水利的伟大潜力。由于人多，学龄儿童全数入学的问题不能在短时期内解决，我因希望各级人民政府和各地方农业合作社在这方面多多努力，同时还希望社会上有知识有财力的人也帮助国家克服这一困难。现在看来，由于党和政府的正确号召，全国人民的坚强奋斗，在水利方面，过去几年已有不少成就，减轻了连年不同程度的水旱灾害，粮食历年都有增产。目前全国更进入一个空前规模的兴修农田水利的高潮，每天在水利工程战线上从事劳动的农民，全国达到一亿人以上。这个兴修水利运动正在热火朝天地继续发展，可以断定今年水利工程的效益，是达到或超过今年粮食产量三千九百二十亿斤指标的有力保证；全国农业发展纲要“修正草案”第五条关于水利的要求一定可以提前实现。在教育方面，由于政府和人民群众的努力，学龄儿童全数入学的问题也正在逐步地解决。历年来小学在校人数都有增长，群众办学也有很大的发展，由于儿童出生率逐年增加，国家还要以主要部分的财政力量从事经济建设，不能不更多的依靠农业合作社和私人兴办教育，来帮助国家克服这一困难。全国农业发展纲要修正草案第三十一条规定“在扫除文盲，发展农村文化教育工作上，大力提倡群众集体办学，并允许私人办学，以便逐步普及小学教育”。在这次预算和经济计划的报告上，都可以看出国家在以相当财力兴办水利和教育事业外，并大力发展群众治水群众办学的方向。这些，都充分地体现了党一贯地采用依靠群众力量克服困难的好办法，这是非常值得鼓舞的。
    我在第一次大会说“人多是喜事，但在困难很多的环境里，也应有些限度”，因而引述列宁的话“指出工人阶级与新马尔萨斯主义绝不相容，决不妨碍我们要求传播有关避孕的医学理论等等措施”。由于我国一向没有避孕的习惯，避孕同子孙越多越好的传统思想相抵触，推行制节生育的工作，初期是有困难的。可是由于党和政府的注意，并已采取适当措施，这种困难也在逐渐克服中。一九五五年三月党中央颁发的有关节制生育的指示里曾提出：“节制生育是关系广大人民生活的一项重大政策性的问题。在当前的历史条件下，为了国家、家庭和新生一代的利益，我们党是赞成适当的节制生育的。”一九五六年九月周恩来总理在党的第八次全国代表大会所作报告里说：“为了保护妇女和儿童，很好地教养后代，以利民族的健康和繁荣，我们赞成在生育方面加以适当的节制。卫生部门应该协同有关方面对于节育问题进行适当的宣传，并且采取有效的措施。”去年提出农业发展纲要修正草案，第二十九条明确规定了“除了少数民族的地区以外，在一切人口稠密的地方，宣传和推广节制生育，提倡有计划地生育子女。”经过党和政府这一系列的提倡推行，计划生育的必要已能为广大群众所认识，不久以前上海市人民代表大会所作决议里说“要积极推广节制生育，提倡有计划地生育子女，争取在第二个五年计划期内逐步把本市人口的出生率从目前的千分之四十降低到千分之二十以下。”不只上海市如此，全国各大城市也在向这方面迈进。过去一般认为农村还谈不到节育，现在形势也大变了。湖南省双峰县光明农业社订出生育规划，要把人口增长率从百分之四降低到百分之一点八。山东省文登县望海乡万家庄村一年来注意避孕宣传，使青壮年妇女发挥了劳动潜力，今年长期参加劳动的比去年增加了两倍多。这次大会云南省李能代表发言里，举出晋宁县上蒜农业合作社社员懂得计划生育的道理以后，多子女的就结札输精管，不少人买避孕套。以上的事例，都是觉悟了的农民会欢迎计划生育的确证。同时，农民也会接受推迟结婚的劝导，在最近热火朝天的水利工程战线上，已有青年男女自动商定推迟婚期；但是也还有极少数人不到婚姻法规定的年龄就私自结婚，而未遭受制止的，这是绝对不应再予容忍的现象！本年“中国青年”第一期有一篇“要制止违法早婚”的短文，把理由说得很透彻，只是未说明怎样加以制止。人们要问违法早婚能够制止吗？我的答案是肯定的。广大农民的觉悟已大大提高，只须在农村的社会主义大辩论中着重宣传农业发展纲要修正草案第二十九条，把计划生育的好处，生育过早过多过密的害处，详加对比，彻底讲解，同时在农村整风中全面检查有无放任违法早婚的情事，如果还有就公开给以批评纠正，是一定可以保证不再有人违法早婚的。但是，计划生育的工作，只可以说是有了良好的开端，还必须要有很多的办法，始能克服横在面前的各种困难。希望有关部门和全体人民在这方面更加努力。
    八年以来，我国的情况确是一年比一年好，一九五八年更要比一九五七年好得多。八年中间也曾遇到不少的困难，有些困难还是很严重的，但由于党和政府确实有办法，把每一个困难都克服了，每一次的困难克服以后，就有一种更好的希望在我们面前，而同时也还会有新的困难，全国人民在党的领导下，发挥自己的积极性，实现领导和群众相结合的办法，任何困难都是可以克服的。我们应当有百倍的信心和希望，向着社会主义的大道迈进。
    我建议大会批准一九五八年预算案，经济计划，汉语拼音方案和有关的各项报告。我以无比的喜悦和兴奋，敬祝大会成功！
