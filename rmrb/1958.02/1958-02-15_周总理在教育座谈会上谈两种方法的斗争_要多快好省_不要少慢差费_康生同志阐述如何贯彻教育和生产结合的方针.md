Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Premier Zhou Enlai invited representatives of universities from various regions attending the Fifth Session of the National People's Congress and heads of universities in the capital for an education problem symposium on the 9th and 12th. Comrade Kang Sheng made an important speech at the meeting on the issue of combining education with production.

More than 300 people attended the two meetings, including responsible persons from various departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, various ministries of the State Council, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and heads of cultural and artistic groups in the capital.

Premier Zhou said in his speech that, like other fronts, the cultural and educational front is engaged in two struggles during the rectification movement: one is the struggle between the capitalist road and the socialist road. This struggle has been basically resolved through the anti-Rightist struggle; however, intellectuals still have many capitalist ideas and styles, and there are still many issues worth debating in this regard, and this struggle should continue. The other is the struggle over methods for building socialism: is it to implement the method of more, faster, better, and more economical, or the method of less, slower, worse, and more expensive? These two methods of struggle also exist on the cultural and educational front. At this session of the National People's Congress, representatives from cultural and educational units in various regions introduced many good experiences in running schools diligently and thriftily and running schools by the masses. These experiences are all about solving the problem of how to build socialism better and faster. It is hoped that after everyone returns, they will promote them according to local conditions, so that the backward can catch up with the advanced, and the advanced can become more advanced, and greatly promote education work. Premier Zhou also gave important instructions on the principles and methods of building socialism, divided into twelve issues.

Comrade Kang Sheng then gave a vivid speech on the vigorous atmosphere he recently saw when inspecting universities and secondary technical schools in various regions. He also emphasized the experience of some schools in starting to implement the socialist education policy of combining education with production.

Comrade Kang Sheng said that after the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, a vigorous and exciting new atmosphere has emerged in education work in various regions. This new atmosphere is first manifested in the great development of schools run by the people. The enthusiasm of the masses for running schools on their own is very high. In Guizhou, nearly 500,000 students are in primary schools run by the masses, accounting for 30.5% of the total number of primary school students. The number of primary schools run by the people in other provinces is also very large. The masses are also developing secondary schools on their own very quickly. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, students in secondary schools run by the people account for 19.54% of the total number of secondary school students in Hebei Province, 19.68% in Liaoning Province, and 17.39% in Shandong Province. The masses in various regions who run middle and primary schools on their own all pay attention to implementing the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily. Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative in Xinfan County, Sichuan, spent 100 yuan to run a middle school. The masses themselves have risen up to run schools, making up for the inadequacy of state-run schools, which will bring great benefits to China's education cause. They can train more knowledgeable workers for the country, combine mental and physical labor, and greatly improve China's education cause in terms of quality and quantity. Secondly, a large number of cadres sent to rural areas have played a great role in popularizing and promoting cultural and educational work. Among the cadres sent to lower levels are professors, teachers, technicians, and other intellectuals. Sending this group of cadres to lower levels is equivalent to sending culture and education to lower levels, which is a great impetus to the entire education work. Third, there is a great enthusiasm for part-work and part-study in various regions, and students are very enthusiastic about running schools diligently and thriftily, and many very gratifying phenomena have appeared. Sichuan University originally planned to build a new chemistry building. Students posted big-character posters and put forward many ways to save the use area of the house. As a result, the chemistry building was not built. Sichuan Normal College spent 70,000 yuan more to build school buildings. Students posted big-character posters asking to investigate responsibility and hoping to avoid such waste in the future. Some university students in the Southwest took the initiative to ask for a reduction in scholarships. The Ministry of Higher Education originally planned to reduce it to 68%, but the students proposed a 50% reduction. Fourth, some schools have begun to implement the policy of combining education with production. This new education policy was first implemented in technical schools. After the rectification movement, it has now been extended to some industrial universities. Combining education and production is an important policy for socialist education.

After listing the above-mentioned new atmospheres in education, Comrade Kang Sheng said that the key to promoting the emergence of these new atmospheres lies in carrying out socialist ideological education for students and faculty members. The human factor and the factor of improved socialist consciousness are issues that must be paid attention to in teaching reform. When people's ideological awareness is improved and their political enthusiasm is brought into play, the work will be easier to handle, and the quality and quantity of our education will be greatly improved.

Comrade Kang Sheng then focused on elaborating on the issue of combining education and production.

Comrade Kang Sheng pointed out that combining education and production is the policy of socialist education, and we must implement it. Is it possible to carry out labor production in schools? Comrade Kang Sheng believes that the potential of machinery and equipment in some industrial schools is very great, the technical force is very strong, and the utilization rate of machines is very low. The objective conditions for carrying out labor production are fully available. According to preliminary incomplete surveys of twelve universities and fifteen secondary technical schools in Beijing, these twenty-seven schools have a total of 1,400 to 1,500 machine tools, and the machine utilization rate is estimated to be only 30% to 50%. According to incomplete statistics from the former Ministry of Higher Education, there are 2,917 machine tools and 2,753 technical workers in higher industrial schools in nine cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuchang, Chengdu, Chongqing, Harbin, and Xi'an. It can be seen that it is entirely possible to organize labor production in these schools. Combining education and production has four major benefits: combining theory with practice, combining mental labor with physical labor, combining intellectuals with workers and peasants, and doing more things with less money.

Comrade Kang Sheng said that combining education and production has many benefits. First, it can improve teaching quality and improve the political and ideological awareness of teachers and students, and combine theory with practice; second, labor production can solve the problem of combining mental labor with physical labor; third, it can solve the problem of combining intellectuals with workers and peasants; fourth, economically speaking, it can greatly save money, do more things, and greatly reduce expenses.

Comrade Kang Sheng pointed out that there are still some difficulties in implementing the policy of combining education and production, such as ideological difficulties: teachers are worried about whether labor production will affect teaching and scientific research work, and administrative staff are afraid that students' production will damage the machines; work-related difficulties: including teaching plans, internship time, and how to solve the collaboration between various teaching and research departments? Supply and marketing difficulties: Is there a problem with the supply of raw materials and the sales of finished products? Comrade Kang Sheng said that all these difficulties exist, but as long as the entire school personnel conduct a large-scale airing of views, big debates, and fully mobilize the masses and firmly rely on the masses, these difficulties can be gradually resolved. Comrade Kang Sheng also introduced some experiences of some schools in solving the above-mentioned difficulties and problems.

In order to implement the policy of combining education and production, what work should be done currently? Comrade Kang Sheng introduced several tasks that Beijing universities are preparing to start: First, take the combination of education and production as the policy of socialist education, and launch a large-scale airing of views and debates throughout the school. Through debates, discover problems and solve problems; second, conduct investigation and reconnaissance work to study the production potential of the region and the school; third, put forward preliminary plans, which can be divided into school-wide, department-wide, class-wide, and individual; fourth, carry out organizational work and establish some necessary institutions to direct production, and turn laboratories and internship factories that can engage in production into production factories.

Comrade Kang Sheng said that to implement the policy of part-work and part-study and the combination of education and production, it is necessary to achieve: First, all secondary technical schools and technical schools, wherever possible, should use pilot factories and farms for production, students should implement part-work and part-study, and schools should achieve self-sufficiency. All higher industrial schools, where possible, should carry out production in laboratories and affiliated factories that can carry out production internships, provided that teaching and scientific research are guaranteed. In addition, students and teachers can also sign contracts with nearby factories to participate in production in a planned way. Second, all agricultural schools, in addition to carrying out production on their own farms, can also sign contracts with local agricultural cooperatives to participate in the production of agricultural cooperatives, and send teachers to agricultural cooperatives to combine theory and practice. Agricultural schools should accept young peasants with learning conditions recommended by agricultural cooperatives. Rural primary and secondary schools should sign contracts with local agricultural cooperatives to participate in agricultural and sideline production labor. Rural students should also use their holidays and holidays to return to their villages to participate in production. Third, general universities and urban secondary schools, where possible, can jointly establish affiliated factories or workshops with several schools, or sign contracts with factories, construction sites, or service industries to participate in labor. All universities, middle schools, and primary schools with land should establish affiliated farms. Schools without land near the suburbs can participate in labor in nearby agricultural cooperatives. An effective way is "three diligence" and "three releases." The three diligences are: diligence and thrift in running schools, diligence and thrift in production, and part-work and part-study. The three releases are: cadres sent to lower levels for labor, departments and classes sent to lower levels, and schools open their doors.

Comrade Kang Sheng said that according to the above policy, the effective method currently implemented in universities is called three diligence and three releases. The three diligences are: diligence and thrift in running schools, diligence and thrift in production, and part-work and part-study. The three releases are: cadres sent to factories and rural areas for labor training; schools open their doors, maintain close contact with neighbors, and sign contracts with nearby rural areas, factories, and streets to participate in production and work; school cadres and party committee staff sent to departments and classes.

Comrade Kang Sheng pointed out that judging from the experience created by the masses in various regions, from the experience of education work in the anti-Japanese base areas in the past, from the experience of Soviet education work, and from Marxist theory, it can be proved that the combination of education and production is correct. This is an important policy for socialist education, and we must attach importance to this policy ideologically, so as to implement and promote it in action.

Comrade Kang Sheng finally said that, in general, the achievements of the education cause in the eight years since the founding of the country are enormous. These achievements eloquently prove that: the Communist Party does have the ability to lead schools and cultural and educational work; the policy of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is correct, and these experiences have played a great role in developing China's education cause and improving the teaching quality of schools; teaching reform and the adjustment of departments are necessary. These reforms are necessary measures and methods to change the old education that served the reactionary bureaucratic bourgeoisie into a new socialist education that serves the working people. Comrade Kang Sheng said that after the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, new situations, new atmospheres, and new people have emerged in various schools. In short, the education cause is very promising; people can be transformed, more things can be done, and less money can be spent. As long as we carry out in-depth socialist ideological education, implement the policies of running schools by the masses, running schools diligently and thriftily, part-work and part-study, and combining education and production; as long as we boldly mobilize the masses, firmly believe in the masses, and rely on the masses, China's education cause can develop forward at a greater speed along the correct direction of more, faster, better, and more economical, and the quality and quantity of education can be further improved. China can be built into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture more quickly.

After Comrade Kang Sheng's speech, the heads of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Tsinghua University, Beijing Mining College, Shanghai Jiaotong University, and No. 3 Middle School of Changge County, Henan introduced some experiences of these schools in implementing the combination of education and production, which aroused the attention of the attendees.

    周总理在教育座谈会上谈两种方法的斗争
    要多快好省　不要少慢差费
    康生同志阐述如何贯彻教育和生产结合的方针
    新华社14日讯　周恩来总理在9日和12日两天，邀请出席全国人民代表大会第五次会议的各地高等学校的人民代表和首都各高等院校负责人，举行教育问题座谈会，康生同志在会上就教育和生产结合问题作了重要的发言。
    出席这两次会议的还有党中央各部、国务院各部和北京市委有关的负责人、首都文化艺术团体的负责人，出席会议的共有三百多人。
    周总理在会上致词说，文教战线和其他战线一样，在整风运动中进行两种斗争：一种是资本主义道路和社会主义道路的斗争。这两条道路的斗争经过反右派斗争，已经基本胜利解决；但是知识分子还存在着不少资本主义的思想意识和作风，在这方面还有很多问题值得辩论，这种斗争还应该继续下去。另一种是建设社会主义的方法的斗争：是实行多、快、好、省的方法，还是实行少、慢、差、费的方法。这两种方法的斗争在文教战线上也存在着。在这次全国人民代表大会的会议上，各地文教单位的代表，介绍了许多勤俭办学、群众办学的好的经验，这些经验都是解决更好、更快的建设社会主义的方法问题，希望大家回去后，根据本地情况加以推广，使落后的赶上先进，先进的更加先进，把教育工作大大推向前进。周总理在会上还就建设社会主义的方针和方法问题，分为十二个问题作了重要的指示。
    康生同志接着就他最近视察各地高等学校和中等技术学校所看到的生气蓬勃的气象，作了生动的发言，他还着重介绍了教育和生产相结合这一社会主义教育方针，在某些学校开始实行的经验。
    康生同志说，经过整风运动和反右派斗争，各地教育工作出现了一种生气蓬勃、令人兴奋的新气象。这种新气象首先表现在民办学校有了很大发展。群众自办学校的热情很高，贵州群众自办小学学生近五十万，占小学学生总数的30.5％，其他各省民办小学的数量也很大。群众自办中学也发展得很快，根据教育部的统计，河北省民办中学学生占中学生总数的19.54％，辽宁省占19.68％，山东省占17.39％。各地群众自办中、小学都注意贯彻勤俭办学的方针，四川新繁县新民农业合作社用了一百元办了一所中学。群众自己起来办学，弥补国家办学的不足，将为我国的教育事业带来很大的好处，可以为国家培养更多的有知识的劳动者，使脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合，把我国教育事业在质量上和数量上大大提高一步。其次，大批干部下放农村，对普及和推广文化教育工作起了很大的作用。下放干部中有教授、教员、技术人员及其他知识分子，这批干部下放就等于文化教育的下放，对整个教育工作是一个很大的推动力量。第三，各地勤工俭学的劲头很大，学生对勤俭办校的积极性很高，出现了许多非常可喜的现象。四川大学原来计划新建一座化学楼，学生贴了大字报，提出许多可以节约房屋使用面积的办法，结果这座化学楼不盖了。四川师范学院修建校舍多花了七万元，学生贴大字报，要求追究责任，希望以后避免这种浪费现象。西南地区有些高等学校学生主动要求减少助学金，高等教育部原拟减至68％，学生提出减少50％。第四，有些学校开始实行教育和生产相结合的方针。这种新的教育方针首先在技工学校开始实行，经过整风运动，目前已推行到某些工业大学。把教育和生产结合起来，这是社会主义教育事业一个重要的方针。
    康生同志在列举了教育事业出现的上述种种新气象之后说，促使这些新气象的出现，关键的问题在于向在校的学生、教职人员进行社会主义思想教育。人的因素、社会主义觉悟提高的因素，是教学改革工作中必须注意的问题。人们的思想觉悟提高了，政治积极性发挥起来了，工作就会好办，我们教育事业的质量和数量也就会大大提高。
    康生同志接着着重阐述了教育和生产结合的问题。
    康生同志指出，教育和生产结合是社会主义教育的方针，我们必须贯彻执行。在学校里进行劳动生产有无可能呢？康生同志认为在一些工业学校里机器设备的潜力很大，技术力量很强，机器的利用率很低，进行劳动生产的客观条件是完全具备的。根据北京十二所高等学校和十五所中等技术学校初步的不完备的调查，这二十七所学校共有机床一千四百到一千五百台，机器利用率据初步估计仅达到30％到50％；又据原高等教育部不完全的统计，在北京、天津、上海、南京、武昌、成都、重庆、哈尔滨和西安等九个城市的高等工业学校里，就有二千九百十七台机床，有技术工人二千七百五十三名，可见在这些学校组织劳动生产是完全可能的。教育与生产结合四大好处理论与实践结合，脑力劳动与体力劳动结合，知识分子与工农结合，事可多办，钱可少花。
    康生同志说教育和生产结合有很多好处。首先，可以提高教学质量，提高教学人员和学生的政治思想觉悟。使理论与实践结合起来；其次，通过劳动生产可以解决脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的问题；第三，可以解决知识分子和工农结合的问题；第四，从经济上说，可以大大节约，事情可以多办，经费可以大大减少。
    康生同志指出，实行教育和生产相结合的方针也还有一些困难的，例如思想方面的困难：教学人员担心进行劳动生产是否会影响教学和科学研究工作，行政人员怕学生生产损坏了机器；工作方面的困难：包括教学计划、实习时间、各教研室协作等问题如何解决？供销方面的困难：原料的供应，成品的推销有无问题？康生同志说，所有这些困难都是存在着的，但只要经过全校人员大鸣、大放、大辩论，放手发动群众和坚决依靠群众，这些困难都可以逐步地得到解决。康生同志还介绍了一些学校在解决上述困难和问题的某些经验。
    为了贯彻执行教育和生产结合的方针，目前应该作那些工作呢？康生同志介绍了北京市高等学校准备着手作的几件工作：第一，把教育和生产相结合作为社会主义教育的方针，展开全校大鸣、大放、大辩论，通过辩论，发现问题，解决问题；第二，进行调查和摸底的工作，研究本地区和本校有多大的生产潜力；第三，提出初步规划，规划可分为全校的、系的、班的和个人的；第四，进行组织工作，建立一些必要的指挥生产的机构，把能够从事生产的实验室和实习工厂变成生产工厂。
    康生同志说，实行勤工俭学和教育与生产相结合的方针就要作到：一、一切中等技术学校、技工学校，凡是可能的应该一律利用试办工厂和农场，进行生产，学生实行半工半读，学校作到自给自足。一切高等工业学校凡是可以进行生产实习的实验室和附属工厂，在保证教学和科学研究的条件下，都应该尽可能地进行生产。此外，还可以由学生和教师同附近工厂订立合同，有计划地参加生产。二、一切农业学校，除了在自己的农场进行生产外，还可以和当地农业社订立合同，参加农业社的生产，并且派教师到农业社，使理论和实际结合。农业学校应该接收农业社所保送的有学习条件的青年农民入学。农村中小学都要同当地农业社订立合同，参加农、副业生产劳动。农村学生还应利用假期、假日回到本村参加生产。三、一般大学、城市中等学校在可能条件下，可以由几个学校联合成立附属工厂或作坊，也可以同工厂、工地或服务行业订立参加劳动的合同。一切有土地的大、中、小学应设立附属农场，没有土地的邻近郊区的学校，可以到附近农业社参加劳动。有效办法是“三勤”和“三放”三勤是：勤俭办学，勤俭生产，勤工俭学。三放是：干部下放劳动，下放班系，学校开放大门。
    康生同志说，根据上述方针，目前在高等学校中实行起来的有效办法叫做三勤三放，三勤即：勤俭办学，勤俭生产，勤工俭学。三放即：干部下放工厂、农村劳动锻炼；学校开放大门，和左邻右舍密切联系，和附近农村、工厂、街道订立合同，参加生产，参加工作；校部干部、党委工作人员下放班系。
    康生同志指出，无论从现在各地群众所创造的经验来看，从过去抗日根据地教育工作实践的经验来看，从苏联教育工作的经验以及从马克思主义的理论上来看，都可以证明教育和生产相结合是正确的，这是社会主义教育的重要方针，我们必须从思想上重视这一方针，从而在行动上加以贯彻、推广。
    康生同志最后说，总的说来，建国八年来教育事业的成绩是巨大的，这些成绩雄辩地证明了：共产党确实有能力可以领导学校和文化教育工作；学习苏联先进经验的方针是正确的，这些经验对发展我国教育事业和提高学校的教学质量起了很大作用；教学改革、院系调整是必要的，这些改革是把旧的为反动的官僚资产阶级服务的教育，改变为新的为劳动人民服务的社会主义教育的必须措施和办法。康生同志说，经过反右派斗争和整风运动，各个学校都出现了新的局面，新的气象、新的人物，总而言之，教育事业大有希望；人可改造，事可多办，钱可少花。只要我们深入的进行社会主义的思想教育，贯彻执行群众办学、勤俭办学、勤工俭学、教育和生产相结合的方针；只要放手发动群众，坚决相信群众和依靠群众，我国的教育事业就可以沿着多快好省的正确方向以更大的速度向前发展，教育事业的质量和数量可以更进一步地提高，我国就可以更快地建设成为拥有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。
    康生同志发言后，北京航空学院、北京清华大学、北京矿业学院、上海交通大学、河南长葛县第三中学等院校的负责人，在会上介绍了这些学校实行教育和生产相结合的一些经验，这些经验引起了到会人员的重视。
