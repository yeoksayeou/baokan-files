Speaking as a representative, Gao Shuxun discusses Hebei Province’s agricultural production and water conservancy construction plan.

Despite Hebei Province's history of frequent droughts and floods and low crop yields, we believe that with the leadership of the Party and the revolutionary drive of the masses, we have full confidence in achieving the following: guaranteeing the completion of 25 billion jin of grain this year, and striving to exceed it; irrigating 100 million mu of land next year, basically realizing water conservancy within two years; accumulating 1.5 trillion jin of fertilizer this year, applying 10,000 jin per mu; completing soil improvement in three years; developing high-yield crops; requiring 80 counties and cities to achieve a grain yield of 400 jin per mu or more this year; launching a three-year shock campaign and completing afforestation in five years.

I fully agree with the various reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and will implement them in our work. Now, regarding the situation of agricultural production and water conservancy construction in Hebei, and how to organize a great leap forward in agricultural production, I would like to express some opinions for our province's goal of "strenuous three-year battle to change the face, ten-year plan completed in five years."

Through last year's bumper harvest, one-third of agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province have caught up with or exceeded the production and income level of well-to-do middle peasants. All agricultural cooperatives in Zunhua, Qianxi, and Xinglong counties have caught up with or exceeded the level of well-to-do middle peasants.

In 1957, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central Government and the strong support from fraternal provinces and cities, and through the hard work of the people of the province, we finally overcame the largest drought since liberation and achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture. In that year, the total grain output (including soybeans) of our province reached 20.2 billion jin, an increase of 7 percent compared to the bumper year of 1952; the total cotton (lint) output reached 629 million jin, an increase of 6 percent compared to 1952; the number of pigs at the end of the year reached 8.4 million, an increase of 49.5 percent compared to 1952, the year with the highest number of pigs in history. Other productions also largely increased compared to 1952. Nine counties and two cities in the province had their grain yields per mu reach or exceed the 400-jin target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Outline (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule; eight counties and one city had their cotton yields per mu reach or exceed the 60-jin target stipulated in the Outline ahead of schedule. There were 2,849 agricultural cooperatives with grain yields of 400 jin per mu or more, and 1,689 agricultural cooperatives with cotton yields (lint) of 60 jin per mu or more. While generally increasing production, many high-yield model examples also emerged, creating a record of double-thousand-jin yields per mu. After this bumper harvest, some areas in our province that historically lacked grain all year round have become surplus grain areas. Nearly one-third of the agricultural cooperatives in the province have caught up with or exceeded the production and income level of local well-to-do middle peasants. All agricultural cooperatives in Zunhua, Qianxi, and Xinglong counties have caught up with or exceeded the production and income level of well-to-do middle peasants. When we celebrate this bumper harvest, the people of Hebei sincerely thank the correct leadership of the Central Government and the strong support from fraternal provinces and cities!

After the socialist education movement in rural areas, the masses' production enthusiasm is boiling, and "crossing the Yellow River early and heading straight for the Yangtze River" has become the common slogan of the vast number of peasants.

The completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the socialist propaganda and education movement carried out in the countryside since the second half of 1957, have greatly inspired the revolutionary drive of the people. "Striving to cross the Yellow River early and heading straight for the Yangtze River" has become the common battle slogan of the vast number of peasants in the province. Under such circumstances, a mass movement of unprecedented scale for water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation has been launched in our province since the winter. The manpower invested in this movement reaches as many as 12 million people every day. As of late January this year, in about three months, we have expanded the irrigated area by more than 25.42 million mu in the province, equivalent to more than 30 times the average annual expansion of irrigated area in the six years before cooperation. In terms of soil and water conservation projects in mountainous areas, 1,703 small reservoirs have been completed, and another 1,985 are under construction, increasing the controlled watershed area by a total of 5,433 square kilometers. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, the province has completed 500 billion jin, an average of more than 4,000 jin per mu, equivalent to more than twice the annual fertilizer accumulation before cooperation.

Red flags are everywhere in the daytime, and lights are bright at night. The scale of splitting mountains to obtain water sources and competing for water from the sea is unprecedented, and the spirit of transforming nature is earth-shattering.

From the beginning, this movement has conscientiously implemented the principles of overall planning, comprehensive management, concentrated management, comprehensive utilization, and focusing on storage, small-scale projects, and community-run projects. It clearly implemented the idea of "focusing on storage, storing for use." In mountainous areas, reservoirs and water cellars are built; in plains, pits, ponds, low-lying areas, and river channels are used to store floodwater, which not only solves the irrigation water source but also prevents floods and waterlogging, killing two birds with one stone, which satisfies the masses. At the same time, we have also paid attention to combining the movement with current production, combining the long-term interests of the masses with the current practical interests, and achieving "reservoirs completed, canals connected, wells completed, land leveled," using them as they are built, thereby continuously improving the enthusiasm of the masses, irrigating wheat fields first and then uncultivated land, ensuring a good start for the great leap forward in production. Now, the people are working more and more bravely, and the movement is expanding wider and wider, forming an unprecedented heroic feat of transforming nature, splitting mountains to obtain water sources and competing for water from the sea. In many counties, the number of laborers dispatched often reaches about 90 percent. The movement has penetrated every corner and every person, truly "every township has tasks, every cooperative is engaged in water conservancy," day and night, persevering unremittingly. Often, for dozens of miles, there is a sea of people, red flags everywhere in the daytime, and lights are bright at night. In Shibanfang Village, Xingtai, on the top of the Taihang Mountains, in order to divert water for irrigation, people poured water over a 24-zhang-high cliff and split a 10-li-long flood diversion canal. Led by Party members and Youth League members, like the heroes who opened up Erlang Mountain, they tied ropes from the mountain peaks and carried out excavation in the high air. They also composed a folk song: "Party members, Youth League members, and the masses are of one mind, everyone twisted into a single rope, opening mountains and crossing ridges to build water conservancy, increasing production by 77,000 next year, lacking 6,000 in grain this year, selling 71,000 to the country next year." Despite the freezing weather, wind, and snow, people are becoming more and more enthusiastic, boldly expressing: "Cold weather cannot stop enthusiasm, frozen ground cannot stop determination, heavy snow cannot cover up confidence, strong winds cannot blow down perseverance." The movement continues to advance. The masses on the outer dam of Zhangjiakou, braving the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius, used cotton quilts as windbreaks, working all night, chiseling canals and digging wells piece by piece from the ground frozen as hard as stone. Xiaohaizi Township, Shangdu County, dug 820 wells in the severe cold, becoming a banner for the well-digging movement on the dam.

Xushui County has built more than 100 reservoirs, and the county has formed a water conservancy system in which rivers are connected to rivers, canals are connected to canals, and reservoirs are connected to reservoirs. This year, it plans to leap from last year's 210 jin per mu to 500 jin per mu.

Xushui County is one of the most planned and systematic areas in Hebei's water conservancy construction movement. There are 89 hills in the county, and 27 have been brought under control. In 1958, more than 200 reservoirs are planned to be built in mountainous and plain areas, and more than 100 have been completed. After the completion of these reservoirs, a total of 130 million cubic meters of water will be stored, eliminating flood and waterlogging disasters in the county and realizing water conservancy. Wells have also been dug in the canal-irrigated land, using canals when there is water in the canals and using wells when there is no water in the canals. Now, the county has formed a water conservancy system in which rivers are connected to rivers, canals are connected to canals, and reservoirs are connected to reservoirs. In this way, the speed of agricultural production increase has taken a great leap forward, with plans to reach 500 jin per mu this year from last year's 210 jin per mu. The creation of Xushui County has now become a model for our province's progress, which has further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses in various places. Women, children, and the elderly are taking action and supporting the movement. For example, the masses have raised no less than 600 million bricks for well-digging. Achieve: "Those with money contribute money, those with materials contribute materials, those with technology contribute technology, and those with ideas contribute ideas." According to statistics from Cangxian Prefecture, the masses' investment has reached more than 15 million yuan, equivalent to more than three times the state's investment in the area. People are working with the momentum of swallowing mountains and rivers, and the speed of the water conservancy movement is advancing by leaps and bounds. The 25-hua-li-long, 103,000-cubic-meter canal in Shucheng Township, Hejian, was originally planned to be completed in 10 days. In order to irrigate the land earlier, the township Party committee proposed a suggestion at 8:00 on November 28 last year, started construction that night, and completed the surprise attack in one night and half a day at 12:00 on the 29th. The members sang a very beautiful and moving poem with extremely excited feelings: "Yesterday's sunset, the river water is in the western depression, this morning's rising sun, the canal water reaches the east of the village, at noon when the sun is due south, the canal water surrounds the village." This is the revolutionary spirit of our socialist era, people competing with time, people declaring war on nature. For example, Ninghe County is close to the sea. People watch the rolling river water flow into the sea in vain. However, for thousands of years, rivers returning to the sea has been a matter of course. Who can change it? This time, the people of Ninghe County stood up, thousands of people on this side of the river, and thousands of people on the other side of the river, relying on their hands and grass bags to block the 28-meter-wide and 3-zhang-deep Jiyun River. The first time, half of the blocking was washed away by the river water. However, people never bowed their heads and never retreated. People held a meeting and put forward a more resolute and louder slogan: "Do not go home without blocking the big river." In this way, they blocked the river together, snatching water back from the sea. Delegates! Just as I am reporting to you, this water conservancy construction movement is still in high tide. Although our plan has been revised and revised again, it has still broken through again and again. It has made our socialist agricultural construction appear a great leap forward at the beginning of the second five-year plan, and opened up a brand-new situation.

Hebei Province's water conservancy movement has crossed the road of several decades, hundreds of years, or even thousands of years of the old era in a few months. In the early stage of the movement, some people's concerns about funds, water sources, technology, labor, etc. were solved in the face of the mass movement. All pessimistic arguments are unfounded.

All these facts tell us that under the socialist system, the people who have gotten rid of exploitation and slavery and who control their own destiny are changing the face of the motherland with the attitude of historical giants. The creativity and enthusiasm of the people are inexhaustible and inexhaustible. In the face of this great and endless power, high mountains will also bow their heads, and rivers will also give way. All the difficulties that were previously considered insurmountable will be overcome one by one. People have crossed the road of several decades, hundreds of years, or even thousands of years of the old era in a few months with majestic steps. The amazing miracles and heroic spirit displayed by the masses in the water conservancy movement have shattered all pessimistic arguments, answered all doubts of right-leaning conservative thoughts, and solved the concerns of some people in the early stage of the movement about funds, water sources, technology, labor, etc. in the face of the mass movement. Originally, medium-sized reservoirs with a water storage capacity of tens of millions of cubic meters, which were considered to be built only by the state, the masses also want to build on their own, and more than a dozen have already started construction. Therefore, all views that measure the development speed of socialist production by the development speed of individual economy, views that measure the development speed of socialist production by the construction speed of the old era when the working people were suppressed, conservative thoughts that lack courage and shrink back, and arguments that emphasize poor geographical conditions or backward production conditions and cannot organize a leap forward in production are all unfounded. In the socialist system, as Engels said, "People begin to consciously create their own history, (can realize) the leap of mankind from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom." The leap forward in production and the miracle of conquering nature are unimaginable in all past historical eras, and are also fundamentally incomparable to the capitalist system. Under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country will write a page that is more magnificent and amazing than the previous page with their pioneering energy.

The experience of the water conservancy movement proves that developing the worker-peasant alliance and strengthening ideological and political work are of great significance, and the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee of all victories.

All these facts tell us that the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class in our country, based on the worker-peasant alliance, has unlimited vitality. In order to support and cooperate with the rural water conservancy movement, the broad masses of workers have done everything possible, worked day and night, and launched a new upsurge of industrial production; a large number of technicians have gone to the countryside and mountains, and a large number of materials and necessary machinery and materials have been continuously transported to the countryside, directly supporting the development of the rural water conservancy movement, and inspiring the enthusiasm of the peasants, which shows the close and unbreakable relationship between worker and peasant brothers in the socialist cause. Many of our important achievements are the crystallization of the worker-peasant alliance.

All these facts tell us that ideological and political work is the lifeline of all work. The great victory of the rural rectification and socialist education movement has changed the spiritual outlook of the countryside. The people are full of confidence in the bright future of socialism, and are energetic and vigorous. It is the driving force that directly promotes this production upsurge. Where ideological work is weak, evil spirits will appear, the wrong path will be taken, the movement will stagnate, and the will of the masses will slacken. The process of the development of this movement is also a process of strengthening ideological and political leadership, criticizing right-leaning conservative thoughts, educating cadres, and educating the people.

All these facts once again tell us that the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve all victories. This is especially intimate for the people of Hebei Province who have persisted in the struggle for decades under the direct leadership of the Party. From long-term personal experience, the people regard the Party as the "North Star." As long as the direction of the Party points there, the people will bravely move forward there. The fact is that the Party and Chairman Mao have pointed out the direction for us and have stipulated clear principles for us on every major issue; just like the previous revolutionary movements, the Party and Chairman Mao are the inspirers and organizers of this unprecedented production upsurge. The fundamental key to the achievement of our province's water conservancy movement is the implementation of the Party Central Committee's policy, and the universal implementation of the Central Committee's instructions on "the secretary takes action, and the whole Party runs water conservancy."

The Tianjin and Cangxian Prefectural Committees have persisted in this way for several years and have achieved results. The storage capacity of their water storage projects this year has reached 5 to 6 billion cubic meters. Tangshan Prefecture stipulated that the prefectural committee should focus on the township, and the county committee should focus on the village. Each person from the prefectural committee to the branch secretary should create a model example. Of the 30 county committee members in Wu'an County, 25 are engaged in water conservancy. Xingtai County moved the office to the mountainous area. The prefectural committee secretary of Baoding Prefecture contracted rivers and guarded key sections for three years. They will not withdraw their troops if the rivers are not managed well. It is precisely because of the strong leadership of the Party that it has guaranteed the continuous strengthening of political and ideological leadership, so that various conservative thoughts have been continuously overcome, thereby making the movement continue to deepen and last.

Although we have achieved great results in agricultural production and water conservancy construction, this does not mean that we have no shortcomings in our work. On the contrary, we do have shortcomings in this regard, and some shortcomings are relatively serious. We are advancing in the process of continuously overcoming shortcomings and mistakes under the leadership of the Central Government. In the future, we must rely more closely on the leadership of the Party, rely on the masses, prevent and overcome deviations, learn from the advanced experience of fraternal provinces and cities, and continue to advance victoriously. At the same time, although we have overcome various difficulties with the support of the masses, and the achievements have been made in the process of overcoming difficulties, it does not mean that there are no difficulties. In fact, difficulties exist now, and there will be difficulties in the future. Therefore, on the one hand, we must have the determination and confidence to overcome all difficulties. At the same time, we must treat every specific difficulty in the process of advancement cautiously and seriously, and gradually overcome it in order to realize the great historical task entrusted to us by the Party and the people.

Hebei Province will guarantee the production of 25 billion jin of grain this year and strive to exceed it, so that the province's agricultural cooperatives will basically catch up with or exceed the production and living standards of local well-to-do middle peasants, and strive to achieve a grain yield of 500 jin per mu and 1,000 jin of grain per person in the province in 1962.

Now, according to the socialist construction policy instructed to us by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Maodeveloping industry and agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry; combined with the actual situation of Hebei Province, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have initially formulated an agricultural production increase plan. In 1958, 25 billion jin of grain will be guaranteed, and efforts will be made to exceed it. By 1962, the total grain output will reach 45 billion jin, with a yield of 500 jin per mu, "crossing the Yellow River" ahead of schedule and overfulfilling the requirements of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Outline, and striving for 1,000 jin of grain per person. Cotton, the total output in 1958 will be 800 million jin, and by 1962, it will reach 1.7 billion jin, with a yield (lint) of 100 jin per mu. Peanuts, the total output in 1958 will reach 900 million jin, and by 1962, it will reach 2.5 billion jin, with a yield of 600 jin per mu. This is the glorious task of the people of our province. After the realization of this task, a new look will appear in agricultural production in our province.

In order to promote the early realization of this task, it is necessary to continuously and unremittingly carry out a production and construction movement centered on water, fertilizer, and soil. (1) Vigorously carry out water conservancy construction. On the basis of 27 million mu of irrigated land in 1957, the irrigated area in the province will reach about 100 million mu by 1959, basically realizing water conservancy in two years. (2) Increase the accumulation and application of fertilizer. It is required to accumulate 1.5 trillion jin of fertilizer in 1958 and apply 10,000 jin per mu. Vigorously develop pig raising. In 1958, it will reach 20 million heads. In 1962, the province will average one pig per person, and the total number of pigs in the province will reach 50 million heads. (3) Complete soil improvement in three years. Improve 50 million mu in 1958. (4) Develop high-yield crops. (5) Cultivate high-yield counties. It is required that the number of counties and cities with a grain yield of 400 jin per mu or more will reach 80 in 1958, including 19 with 500 jin or more and 5 with 800 jin or more. The number of counties and cities with a cotton yield of 60 jin per mu or more will reach 70, including 11 with 80 jin or more and 14 with 100 jin or more. (6) Launch a three-year shock campaign and complete afforestation in five years. After the above requirements are realized, the agricultural cooperatives in the province in 1958 can basically catch up with or exceed the production and income level of local well-to-do middle peasants.

Delegates: Although Hebei Province used to be a province with frequent droughts and floods and low crop yields, we believe that with the leadership of the Party and the revolutionary drive of the masses, we have full confidence in realizing the above plans, isn't it? The transformation of low-lying areas in Tianjin Prefecture, which is known as the lower reaches of the nine rivers, 72 connected depressions, and nine floods in ten years in our province, began after the autumn of 1954. After three years of hard work, the low-lying areas were conquered, and Tianjin Prefecture was transformed from a grain-deficient area in history to a grain-surplus area. The achievements of Tianjin Prefecture are a signal, indicating that the goal of "Hebei Province's arduous three-year battle to change the face and the completion of the ten-year plan in five years" can also be fully achieved and must be achieved.

    苦战三年　改变面貌　十年计划　五年完成
    高树勋代表谈河北省农业生产和水利建设的计划
    尽管河北省过去是旱涝灾害频繁的省份，农作物产量低，但我们相信：有着党的领导，有着群众的革命干劲，我们有充分信心来实现：今年粮食保证完成二百五十亿斤，并争取超过；明年灌溉面积一亿亩，两年基本实现水利化；今年积肥一万五千亿斤，亩施万斤肥；三年完成改良土壤；发展高产作物；要求今年粮食亩产四百斤以上的县市达到八十个；三年突击，五年完成绿化。
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任所作的各项报告，并在我们工作中贯彻执行。现就河北农业生产、水利建设的一些情况，以及如何组织农业生产的大跃进，为我省“苦战三年，改变面貌，十年计划，五年完成”发表一些意见。
    河北省经过去年的丰收，全省已有三分之一的农业社赶上或超过富裕中农的生产和收入水平，遵化、迁西、兴隆三个县的全部农业社赶上或超过了富裕中农的水平。
    一九五七年，我省由于中央的正确领导和各兄弟省、市大力支援，经过全省人民的辛勤努力，终于战胜了解放以来最大的旱灾，获得了农业上的丰收。这一年，我省粮食（包括大豆）的总产量达到二百零二亿斤，比丰收的一九五二年增长百分之七；棉花（皮棉）总产量达到了六亿二千九百万斤，比一九五二年增长百分之六；猪只年底达到八百四十万口，比历史上养猪最多的一九五二年增长百分之四十九点五。其他各项生产也大部比一九五二年有所增长。全省已有九县、二市的粮食亩产量，提前达到或超过了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的四百斤的指标；有八县、一市的棉花亩产量提前达到或超过了纲要草案所规定的六十斤的指标。粮食亩产四百斤以上的农业社有二千八百四十九个，棉花亩产（皮棉）六十斤以上的农业社有一千六百八十九个。在普遍增产的同时，还出现了不少高额丰产典型，创造了亩产双千斤的纪录。经过这次丰收，我省有些历史上常年缺粮的地区，已经变成了余粮地区。全省已经有近三分之一的农业社，赶上或超过了当地富裕中农的生产和收入水平。遵化、迁西、兴隆三个县全部农业社已经赶上或超过了富裕中农的生产、收入水平。当我们庆祝这次丰收的时候，河北人民衷心地感谢中央的正确领导，感谢各兄弟省市对我们的大力支援！
    农村经过社会主义教育运动以后，群众的生产干劲如沸如腾，“早跨黄河，直奔长江”已经成了广大农民的共同口号。
    农业社会主义改造的完成，和一九五七年下半年以来在农村里开展的社会主义宣传教育运动，大大鼓舞了人民的革命干劲。“争取提早跨过黄河，直奔长江”，已经成了全省广大农民群众的共同战斗的行动口号。就在这种情况下，入冬以来一个规模空前壮阔的群众性的兴修水利和积肥运动，在我省掀了起来。投入这个运动的人力，每天有一千二百万人之多。截至今年一月下旬为止，在大约三个月的时间里，我们全省已扩大浇地面积二千五百四十二万多亩，相当于合作化以前六年每年平均扩大浇地面积三十多倍。在山区水土保持工程方面，已经修成了小水库一千七百零三座，正在施工的还有一千九百八十五座，共增加控制流域面积五千四百三十三平方公里。在积肥方面全省已完成五千亿斤，每亩平均四千多斤，相当于合作化以前全年积肥量两倍以上。
    白天红旗遍地，夜晚灯火通明，劈山取源，向海争水，兴修水利的规模史无前例，改造自然的气魄惊天动地。
    这一运动，由一开始，就认真贯彻了全面规划，综合治理，集中治理，综合利用和以蓄为主，小型为主，社办为主的方针。明确贯彻了“以蓄为主，蓄而为用”的思想，在山区修水库、水窖，在平地利用坑塘洼地河道，存蓄洪水，既解决了灌溉水源，也防止了洪涝灾害，一举两得，群众满意。同时我们还注意了使运动与当前生产相结合，使群众的长远利益同当前实际利益相结合，做到“库成渠通，井成地平”随修随用，从而使群众的积极性不断提高，先浇麦地后浇白地，保证打响生产大跃进的第一炮。现在，人民愈干愈勇敢，运动愈推愈广阔，形成了热烈沸腾地劈山取源，向海争水的史无前例的改造自然的英雄壮举。很多县份出动的劳动力，经常达到百分之九十左右。运动深入到每一角落和每一人，真是“乡乡有任务，社社搞水利”，夜以继日，坚持不懈。常常几十里地，一片人海，白天红旗遍地，夜晚灯火通明。邢台石板房村在太行山山顶上，人们为了引水灌溉，浇过二十四丈高的悬崖，劈开了一道十里长的洪水渠，党团员带头，就像开辟二郎山的英雄们一样，从山峰上系着绳子，悬在高空中进行开凿，还编出一首歌谣：“党团干群一条心，大家拧成一股劲，开山过岭修水利，明年增产七万七，今年缺粮六千整，明年卖给国家七万一”。尽管天寒地冻，风雪逼人，人们愈干劲愈足，豪迈地表示：“天冷冷不住热心，地冻冻不住决心，大雪盖不住信心，大风刮不倒恒心”。运动依然不断推进。张家口外坝上的群众，冒着零下三十度严寒，用棉被作风幛，彻夜不停，一块块地硬从冻如坚石的地上凿渠打井，商都县小海子乡，就这样在严寒当中打出了八百二十眼井，成为坝上打井运动的一面旗帜。
    徐水县修成一百多个水库，全县已经形成了河河相通，渠渠相通，库库相通的水利体系，今年计划从去年亩产二百一十斤飞跃到亩产五百斤。
    徐水县是河北兴修水利运动中最有计划、有系统的一个地区，他们全县有八十九个山头，现已根治了二十七个，连山区带平原一九五八年计划修水库二百多个，目前已完成了一百余个。这些水库完成后，共蓄水一亿三千万方，就消灭了境内的洪沥水灾害，实现了水利化。在渠灌地里又打了井，渠里有水用渠，渠里无水用井。现在全县已形成一个河河相通，渠渠相通，库库相通的水利体系。这样一来，他们的农业增产的速度就来了一个大飞跃，计划从去年的亩产二百一十斤今年达到五百斤。徐水县的创造，目前已成为我省前进的榜样，这就更加鼓舞了各地群众的积极性，妇女、儿童、老人动手的动手，支援的支援，例如打井用的砖，就由群众自筹不下六亿块。做到：“有钱出钱，有料出料，有技术出技术，有计献计”。据沧县专区的统计，群众投资就达到一千五百余万元。相等于国家在该区投资的三倍以上。人们以气吞山岳之势劳作着，而水利运动的速度，便愈益突飞猛进。河间束城乡全长二十五华里十万零三千方土的渠道，原计划十天完成，为了要提前浇地，乡党委于去年十一月二十八日八时提出建议，当夜动工，二十九日十二时，一夜零半天，便突击完成了。社员用十分激动的心情唱出一首非常优美动人的诗来：“前天夕阳下，河水在西洼，今晨旭日升，渠水到村东，中午日正南，渠水围村转”。这就是我们社会主义时代的革命精神，人与时间竞赛，人与自然宣战。如宁河县紧靠海边，人们眼看着滚滚的河水，白白地流进大海，可是千年万年河流归大海这是天经地义，谁能变动？这一回宁河县人，却一下站起来，河这边几千人，河那边几千人，就凭双手加草袋要闸住这二十八米宽三丈深的蓟运河，第一次闸了一半就被河水冲垮了，可是人们绝不低头，绝不退却，人们开了会，提出一个更坚决，更响亮的口号“不闸住大河不回家”。就这样一齐闸住了河流，把水从大海那儿争夺回来。各位代表！就在我向你们报告的时候，这个兴修水利运动还正在高涨中，我们的计划虽然修正又修正，还是突破再突破，它使我们的社会主义农业建设，在第二个五年计划的一开头就出现了一个大的跃进，就打开了一个崭新的局面。
    河北省的水利运动在几个月之内跨过了旧时代几十年、几百年甚至几千年的路程，运动初期某些人对资金、水源、技术、劳力等等顾虑在群众运动面前迎刃而解。一切悲观论调都是没有根据的。
    这一切事实告诉了我们，在社会主义制度下，摆脱了剥削和奴役、自己掌握了自己命运的人民，正以历史巨人的姿态，改变着祖国的面貌。人民的创造性和积极性是取之不尽、用之不竭的。在这种伟大的无穷无尽的力量面前，高山也要低头，河水也要让路，一切过去认为难以克服的困难，都会一个个地被压倒，人们在几个月内，以雄伟的步伐跨过了旧时代几十年、几百年甚至几千年的路程。人民群众在水利运动中显示的惊人奇迹和英雄气概，打破了一切悲观论调，回答了一切右倾保守思想的怀疑，运动初期某些人关于资金、水源、技术、劳力等等顾虑，在群众运动面前都迎刃而解，原来认为只能由国家兴修的蓄水几千万公方的中型水库，群众也要自办，而且已有十几座开了工。因此，一切以个体经济的发展速度来衡量社会主义生产发展的观点，以劳动人民被压制的旧时代的建设速度来衡量社会主义生产发展的观点，勇气不足、畏缩不前的保守思想以及强调地理条件不好或生产条件落后而不能组织生产跃进的论点，都是没有根据的。在社会主义制度，正如恩格斯所说的“人们开始完全自觉地自己创造自己的历史，（才能实现）人类从必然王国进入自由王国的飞跃”，生产的跃进，征服大自然的奇迹，是过去一切历史时代不能想望的，也是资本主义制度根本不能比拟的。我国人民在党和毛主席的正确领导下，将以开天辟地的精力，写下一页比一页更雄伟更惊人的历史。
    水利运动的经验证明，发展工农联盟和加强思想政治工作有重大意义，而党的领导则是一切胜利的根本保证。
    这一切事实告诉我们，我国工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，是具有无限生命力的。广大工人群众，为支援配合农村水利运动，千方百计，废寝忘食，掀起了工业生产的新高潮；大批技术人员下乡、上山，大批的物资和必要的机械、材料源源不断地运到农村，直接支援了农村水利运动的发展，鼓舞了农民的积极性，表明了工农兄弟血肉相连，在社会主义事业中亲密的、牢不可破的关系。我们许多重要的成就，都是工农联盟的结晶。
    这一切事实告诉我们，思想政治工作是一切工作的生命线，农村整风和社会主义教育运动的伟大胜利，改变了农村的精神面貌，人民群众为社会主义的光辉前途充满了信心，干劲百倍，生龙活虎，是直接推动这一生产高潮的动力。哪里思想工作薄弱，哪里就出邪气，走歪路，运动停滞不前，群众意志松懈。这一运动发展的过程，也是加强思想政治领导批判右倾保守思想、教育干部、教育人民的过程。
    这一切事实再一次告诉我们，党的领导，是我们获得一切胜利的根本保证。这一点，对于几十年来长期在党直接领导下坚持斗争的河北省人民来说，更是十分亲切，人民从长期切身体验中，把党看成是“北斗星”，只要党的方向指向那里，人民就会勇往直前地奔向那里。事实正是，党和毛主席给我们指出了前进的方向，给我们在每个重大的问题上都规定了明确的方针；如同历次的革命运动一样，也正是，党和毛主席是这次史无前例的生产高潮的鼓舞者和组织者。我省水利运动的成绩的获得，根本关键就是执行了党中央的方针，并普遍地贯彻执行了中央关于“书记动手，全党办水利”的指示。
    天津、沧县两地委就是这样坚持了几年而取得成绩的，他们今年的蓄水工程容量，就达到了五、六十亿公方。唐山专区规定地委抓到乡，县委抓到村，从地委到支部书记每人搞一个典型。武安县三十个县委委员二十五个搞水利，邢台县把办公室搬到山区，保定专区地委书记分河包干，分口把守固定三年，治不好不收兵。由于党的坚强领导才保证了不断地加强政治思想领导，使各种保守思想得到不断的克服，从而使运动不断深入与持久。
    我们虽然在农业生产、水利建设方面获得了巨大的成绩，但是，这并不是说，我们在工作中是没有缺点的，相反的，我们在这方面是存在着缺点的，而且有些缺点也是比较严重的，我们正是在中央领导下不断地克服缺点和错误中前进的，今后也必须更紧密地依靠党的领导，依靠群众，防止和克服偏差，学习兄弟省、市的先进经验，继续胜利前进。同时，虽然我们依靠群众的支持，克服了种种困难，成绩的取得是克服困难的斗争过程中取得的，但是，决不是说没有困难了，事实上，困难现在有，将来也还会是有的，因此我们一方面必须有战胜一切困难的决心和信心，同时必须谨慎地、认真地对待前进过程中的每个具体困难，逐步把它战胜，以实现党和人民交付给我们的伟大历史任务。
    河北省今年保证生产粮食二百五十亿斤并争取超过，使全省农业社基本上赶上或超过当地富裕中农生产和生活的水平，为在一九六二年达到全省亩产粮食五百斤，每人拥有粮食千斤而奋斗。
    现在，我们根据党中央和毛主席指示我们的社会主义建设方针——在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业与发展农业同时并举；结合着河北省实际情况，中共河北省委和省人民委员会已经初步订出了农业增产规划，粮食一九五八年保证完成二百五十亿斤，并争取超过。到一九六二年，粮食总产量达到四百五十亿斤，亩产五百斤，“跨过黄河”提前超额完成农业发展纲要修正草案的要求，为每人一千斤粮食而奋斗。棉花，一九五八年总产量八亿斤，到一九六二年，达到十七亿斤，亩产（皮棉）一百斤。花生，一九五八年总产量达到九亿斤，到一九六二年，达到二十五亿斤，亩产六百斤。这是我省全体人民的光荣任务，实现这一任务后，我省在农业生产上将出现一个新的面貌。
    为了促进这一任务尽早实现，需要持续不懈地、勇往直前地开展以水、肥、土为中心的生产建设运动。（一）大力兴修水利，在一九五七年灌溉面积二千七百万亩的基础上，到一九五九年全省灌溉面积达到一亿亩左右，两年基本实现水利化。（二）增积、增施肥料，要求一九五八年积肥一万五千亿斤，亩施万斤肥。大力发展养猪，一九五八年达到二千万头，一九六二年全省平均达到一人一头猪，全省猪只总数达到五千万头。（三）三年完成改良土壤。一九五八年改良五千万亩。（四）发展高产作物。（五）培养高额丰产县，要求一九五八年粮食亩产四百斤以上的县、市达到八十个，其中：五百斤以上的十九个，八百斤以上的五个。棉花亩产六十斤以上的县，市达到七十个，其中：八十斤以上的十一个，一百斤以上的十四个。（六）三年突击，五年完成绿化。在实现上述要求后，一九五八年全省的农业社即可基本上赶上或超过当地富裕中农生产、收入水平。
    各位代表：尽管河北省过去是个旱涝灾害频繁的省份，农作物产量低，但我们相信：有着党的领导，有着群众的革命干劲，我们就有充分的信心实现上述的规划，不是吗？我省号称九河下梢、七十二连洼、十年九涝的天津专区的洼地改造工作，从一九五四年秋后开始，经过苦战三年，就征服了洼地，使天津专区由历史上的缺粮区变为余粮区。天津专区的成就就是一个信号，说明今后我省人民“苦战三年改变面貌，十年计划五年完成”的目标，也是完全可以达到和一定要达到的。
