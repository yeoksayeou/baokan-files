    Remembering My Days Studying in the Soviet Union
    Fan Peiyi, Instructor at Harbin Institute of Technology

    I returned from studying in the Soviet Union in 1956. The great image of the Soviet people and their sincere friendship towards us often appear in my mind even after returning home. As our two peoples celebrate the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, it makes me miss those dear Soviet comrades even more.

    When we first arrived in the Soviet Union, we couldn't understand Russian, so the school decided to open small classes specifically for Chinese students. During the first math class, a math teacher who had been disabled by war was so moved that he shed tears, saying, "I am very happy and honored to be able to teach Chinese students today." He clasped his hands together and gestured, saying, "You are our closest friends, our friendship has historical traditions, and we will always stand together, unafraid of any enemy."

    The students in the class all hoped and tried various ways to help the Chinese students learn as well as possible. During regular study sessions, the Soviet students often reminded and encouraged me: "You must become the best student in the class, because the tasks on your shoulders are very important." During experiments, they always let me stand at the front. Dr. Poush from our school, in order to help us learn material mechanics well, proactively proposed at the material mechanics teaching and research section meeting that he would provide individual tutoring to Chinese students, and many other teachers also proactively and tirelessly provided us with individual guidance.

    The Soviet students' concern for our daily life was even more meticulous. I remember once when the students in the class went ice skating together, the weather was very cold, and a Soviet female student insisted on taking off her coat and giving it to me. She said seriously: "The weather is very cold, getting frostbite will affect your studies. I am from Moscow, I am used to this kind of weather, getting a little cold doesn't matter." These words deeply moved me.

    My friend Lida was a very good student. One day in class I happened to see her taking notes anxiously. Looking closely, I realized she was taking notes in two notebooks. It turned out she was taking notes for a sick Chinese student.

    The profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is not only reflected in the school, it permeates every city, street, and alley. Once, we passed through the small town of Uglich, and many Soviet people by the roadside stopped to look at us curiously, saying to each other: "Look, Chinese friends, Chinese friends!" Suddenly, an old man asked loudly: "Are you Chinese?" We said yes. He immediately became excited and insisted that we go to his house, explaining several times: "Because you are our relatives." We once traveled to the city of Astrakhan, and just as the car was about to leave the city, suddenly two big hands reached in through the car window and handed in three big watermelons. Then we heard him shout: "Dear Chinese comrades! Taste the watermelons of our city of Astrakhan, I don't have time to talk to you because I have to go to work, I am a worker, goodbye!" Indeed, Sino-Soviet friendship can be seen everywhere. As soon as you step into Soviet territory, whether in large or small cities, on streets and in alleys, you will encounter warm greetings and kind care, making you feel as warm as at home.

### 回忆留苏学习的日子

    回忆留苏学习的日子
    哈尔滨工业大学教员　范培义
    我是1956年回国的留苏学生。苏联人民的伟大形象和他们对我们的真诚友谊，在回国以后还经常出现在我的脑海里。在我们两国人民庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订八周年的时候，更使我想念那些亲爱的苏联同志。
    当我们刚到苏联的时候，俄文听不懂，于是学校决定单给中国同学开小班上课。在第一次上数学课的时候，一位曾因战争而残废了的数学老师感动得流着眼泪说：“今天能教中国同学使我非常高兴，我并因此而感到光荣。”他两手一握作着手势说：“你们是我们最亲密的朋友，我们的友谊是有着历史传统的，我们将永远站在一起，不怕任何敌人。”
    班上的同学都希望而且想各种办法使中国同学学得最好。在平时学习时，苏联同学经常提醒和鼓励我：“你必需成为班上最好的学生，因为你肩上的任务很重大。”在作实验的时候，总是让我站在最前面。我们学校的普什博士，为了帮我们学好材料力学，在材料力学教研室会议上主动提出他将给中国同学进行个别答疑，其他许多老师也都主动地不辞辛苦地对我们进行个别辅导。
    苏联同学对我们日常生活上的关心更是无微不至。记得有一次班上同学一起去滑冰，天气很冷，一个苏联女同学坚持要把她穿的大衣脱给我，她严肃地说：“天气很冷，冻坏了会影响你的学习。我是莫斯科人，我习惯于这种天气，冻一点也不要紧。”这些话深深地感动了我。
    我的朋友丽达学习得很好。有一天上课时我偶然看见她紧张地记着笔记。仔细一看，才知道她在用两个本子记笔记。原来她是在替一个有病的中国同学记的。
    中苏人民深厚的友谊不仅体现在学校里，它遍布于每一个城市的大街小巷。有一次，我们经过小城乌格利奇，路旁很多苏联人都停下来好奇地看着我们，并且彼此讲着：“看，中国朋友，中国朋友！”突然一个老人大声问道：“你们是中国人吗？”我们说是的。他立刻兴高彩烈地一定要我们去他家里，并几次解释说：“因为你们是我们的亲人。”我们曾旅行到过阿斯特拉罕城，当汽车刚要离开这座城市时，忽然从车窗伸进两只大手，送进了三个大西瓜。接着听他喊道：“亲爱的中国同志！尝尝我们阿斯特拉罕城的西瓜吧，我来不及和你们谈了，因为我要去上班，我是个工人，再见！”的确，中苏友谊处处可见，当你刚一踏入苏联国土时，无论是在大小城市，街头巷尾，都能遇到热情的问候和亲切的关怀，使你感到像在家里一样的温暖。（附图片）
