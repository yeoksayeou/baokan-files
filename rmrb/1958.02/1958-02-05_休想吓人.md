Notes: Jottings

    The United States' transportation of atomic weapons and rocket weapons into South Korea, and its carrying out of atomic war exercises, have already aroused great anger among the Korean people and the people of all righteous countries. But the US military authorities invading Korea obviously believe that this is still not enough to display their ferocity, and they even publicly exhibit their atomic cannons and rocket launchers. It can be said that they have reached the extreme of lawlessness.

    If the US authorities are doing this to show the evidence of their crimes, it is completely superfluous, because the fact that the United States is preparing for atomic war in South Korea and seriously undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement is already well known. If the US authorities are doing this to intimidate people, it is also in vain, because if an atomic war really breaks out, things like "Honest John" are nothing more than backward weapons compared to intercontinental missiles.

    休想吓人
    美国把原子武器和火箭武器运进南朝鲜，并进行原子战争演习，这些挑衅行径已经激起了朝鲜人民和各国正义人民的极大愤怒。但是侵朝美军当局显然认为这样仍然不足以显示它的凶恶，居然还公开展出它的原子炮和火箭发射器。可谓无法无天已极了。
    美国当局这样做，如果是为了要以罪证示人，这是完全多余的，因为美国在南朝鲜准备原子战争、严重破坏朝鲜停战协定的事实，已为人所共知了。美国当局这样做，如果是为了要吓唬人，那也是白费的，因为如果真的打起原子战争，什么“诚实的约翰”之类的东西，比起洲际导弹来不过是一些落后的武器而已。
