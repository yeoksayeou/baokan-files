    "Stories in a Store"
    Commercial workers are always hoping for the emergence of novels with the theme of our country's commercial work. The novella "Stories in a Store" is the first novel with the theme of our country's commercial work. This book has now been published by Beijing Publishing House.
    This book depicts a part of the business activities of an ordinary department store in our country. Through some things that happened after Wang Youkang, a demobilized soldier and Communist Party member, became the manager of the department store, it narrates the life of the older generation of commercial workers and the salespersons from student backgrounds. It also describes how demobilized soldiers eventually became skilled commercial workers after assiduously studying their business. From the development of some events, it criticizes the complacency, conservative thinking, subjectivism, and bureaucratic style of individual commercial workers. (Sun Minyou)

    “商店里的故事”
    商业工作者常在盼望着出现以我国商业工作为题材的小说。中篇小说“商店里的故事”，就是第一本以我国商业工作为题材的小说。现在这本书已经由北京出版社出版。
    这本书描绘了我国一个普通的百货商店的一部分业务活动。通过转业军人共产党员王有康到百货商店当经理以后发生的一些事情，叙述了老一代的商业工作者和学生出身的营业员的生活情况。也描写了转业军人在刻苦钻研业务之后终于成了熟练的商业工作者。从一些事件的发展中，批判了个别商业工作者的自满情绪、保守思想和主观主义、官僚主义作风。　（孙民友）
