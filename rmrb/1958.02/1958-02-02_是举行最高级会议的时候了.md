　　This newspaper comprehensively reports, according to Xinhua News Agency dispatches: Under the impetus of the global surge demanding an East-West summit conference, Western politicians, and even heads of government of some countries, are beginning to advocate or continue to advocate the necessity of convening such a meeting.

　　Belgian Prime Minister says: The moment has arrived for national leaders to sit down at a table.

　　Belgian Prime Minister Achille Van Acker said in a speech at a meeting in Halle on January 31st: "All good people, all nations demand peace."

　　Van Acker emphasized that now is the moment for the leaders of the world's major powers to "sit down at a table to solve the disarmament issue and ensure peace." He said: "I believe that in saying this, I am expressing the feelings of the broadest strata of residents."

　　Norwegian Prime Minister says: It is very necessary to hold East-West negotiations.

　　On the same day, Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen said at a debate on foreign policy issues in the Norwegian Parliament that it is now felt to be very necessary to hold East-West negotiations, because we know that a new war cannot be the way out of the current situation, and we must try to find a way to negotiate. In his speech, Gerhardsen reiterated that Norway's rejection of the placement of atomic weapons on its territory is based on Norway's policy towards bases. He also advocated reaching an international agreement to temporarily stop testing atomic weapons.

　　Most Britons say: Britain should pursue an independent course on negotiations.

　　According to New York "Newsweek," the results of a Gallup poll conducted in Britain show that most Britons advocate that the British government pursue a course of negotiating with the Soviet Union. The question posed by the survey was: "What do you think is the best way to avoid a world war?" 65% of the Britons who participated in the test answered "negotiations," and only 8% answered "military measures."

　　Regarding the question, "Do you agree with Prime Minister Macmillan's suggestion regarding a mutual non-aggression treaty, which was the proposition first put forward by the Russians?" 73% expressed agreement, 13% expressed disagreement, and the rest did not give a definite answer.

　　The survey also asked the following question: "On the issue of negotiating with the Russians, if Washington does not express a desire to conduct such negotiations, should Britain take consistent steps with the United States, or take independent action?" 53% advocated pursuing an independent course on this issue, and 37% advocated taking a consistent stance with the United States.

　　British Labour leaders believe: A summit should be held before the end of June.

　　According to Agence France-Presse, citing well-informed sources, British Labour leaders believe that an East-West summit should be held before the end of June this year.

　　They believe that the agenda of such a meeting should include the following three items: (1) Ways to break the deadlock in disarmament negotiations between East and West. (2) Ways to "disengage" Europe. On this point, Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe could be used as a basis for consideration. (3) The Middle East issue.

　　These Labour leaders also stated that "disengagement" should not be limited to nuclear weapons, but should be expanded to the number of munitions and conventional armaments.

　　Eaton says: The United States would make a serious mistake if it does not try to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union.

　　Across the Atlantic, the well-known American entrepreneur Eaton recently said at a business owners' conference in Philadelphia that if the United States does not try to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, then the United States will certainly make a "serious mistake."

　　Eaton said that whether during the Truman era or the Eisenhower era, the State Department has been conducting an anti-Soviet Cold War on all fronts "for the past twelve years." He believes that the claim that the United States cannot reach an agreement with the Soviet Union is unfounded. Only by seeking genuine mutual understanding on the basis of mutual trust can the world be saved from a new world war. He suggested that representatives from all walks of life launch a people's movement to persuade Washington that concluding a friendly agreement with the Soviet Union is necessary and appropriate.

　　是举行最高级会议的时候了
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在全世界普遍要求举行东西方最高级会议的巨浪推动下，西方政治家以至若干国家的政府首脑，也在开始主张或者继续主张有必要召开这种会议。
    比利时首相说：国家领袖坐到一张桌子边的时刻已经到来
    比利时首相阿希尔·范阿克1月31日在哈雷市的大会上发表演说时说：“一切善良的人们、一切民族都要求和平”。
    范阿克强调指出，现在，世界大国领袖“坐到一张桌子边来解决裁军问题和确保和平的时刻已经到来了”。他说：“我相信我在说这番话的时候，我是表达了最广大阶层居民的感情的。”
    挪威首相说：非常有必要举行东西方谈判
    同一天，挪威首相基哈德森在挪威议会外交政策问题的辩论会上说，现在感到非常有必要举行东西方谈判，因为我们知道，新战争不能作为摆脱当前局势的出路，我们要尽力设法走谈判的道路。基哈德森在发言中再次强调指出，挪威拒绝在它的国土上放置原子武器的做法是基于挪威对待基地的政策。他还主张达成暂时停止试验原子武器的国际协议。
    大多数英国人表示：英国在谈判问题上应执行独立路线
    据纽约“新闻周刊”刊载，美国盖洛普民意测验所在英国进行的一次民意调查的结果表明，大多数英国人主张英国政府所执行的路线，同苏联进行谈判。调查提出的问题是：“你们认为避免世界大战的最好办法是什么？”参加测验的英国人65％的回答是“谈判”，只有8％的人回答是“军事措施”。
    对于“你们是否赞同麦克米伦首相关于缔结互不侵犯条约的建议，就是俄国人最先提出的主张？”这个问题，73％的人表示赞同，13％的人表示不赞同，其余的人没有作肯定的回答。
    调查还提了这样一个问题：“在同俄国人进行谈判这个问题上，假如华盛顿没有表示要进行这种谈判的愿望，英国应该同美国采取一致的步调呢，还是采取独立行动？”53％的人主张在这个问题上执行独立的路线，37％的人主张同美国采取一致的立场。
    英工党领袖认为：应在六月底以前举行最高级会议
    据法新社引消息灵通人士的话报道说，英国工党领袖们认为，应该在今年6月底以前举行东西方之间的最高级会议。
    他们认为，这样一次会议的议程应该包括下列三项：（一）打破东西方之间在裁军谈判中的僵局的办法。（二）使欧洲“脱离接触”的办法。在这一点上可以把波兰所提出的在中欧建立无原子武器地区的计划作为一种考虑的基础。（三）中东问题。
    这些工党领袖们还表示，“脱离接触”不应该仅限于核武器方面，而且应该扩大到军火和常规军备的数目方面。
    伊顿说：美国如不设法同苏联达成协议，一定会犯严重错误
    在大西洋彼岸，著名的美国企业家伊顿最近在费城的一个企业主会议上说，如果美国不设法同苏联达成协议，那么美国就一定会犯“严重的错误”。
    伊顿说，不论在杜鲁门时代或者在艾森豪威尔时代，国务院“在最近十二年以来”一直在各个战线上进行反苏冷战。他认为硬说美国不能同苏联取得协议的说法是毫无根据的。只有在互相信任的基础上求得真正互相谅解，才能拯救世界，使它免除新的世界大战。他建议社会各阶层代表发动一个人民运动，来促使华盛顿相信：同苏联缔结友好协定是必要的，也是适宜的。
