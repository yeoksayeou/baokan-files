Experimental Plots Are a Good Way to Link Teaching with Practice
He Zuo

    The leading cadres and teaching staff of Zhejiang Agricultural College have stepped out of their offices and laboratories and personally started cultivating high-yield experimental plots. This is something very worthy of promotion. The task of agricultural colleges is to cultivate agricultural workers who are cultured and knowledgeable in agriculture. What is an agricultural worker who is cultured and knowledgeable in agriculture? This does not refer to people who only understand agricultural science knowledge but do not know how to farm. We are referring to people who have both agricultural science knowledge and the ability to cultivate high-yield fields. Graduates like this, when they take up agricultural production posts, are promoters on the agricultural front and good soldiers on the agricultural front. To cultivate such talents, it must start from the school. In the past, agricultural colleges in general paid more attention to linking teaching with practice, but it was not done thoroughly enough.
    Zhejiang Agricultural College's planting of experimental fields is a good way to combine teaching with production practice and thoroughly overcome closed-door teaching, closed-door study, and closed-door experimental research. This approach will greatly benefit the future improvement of students' agricultural science knowledge, improvement of teaching quality, and improvement of scientific research levels. From the perspective of school leading cadres, experimental fields can enable leading cadres and teaching staff to work together, engage in teaching and scientific research work, and specifically lead this work forward; Party leading personnel can learn professional knowledge from it, gradually become familiar with the problems in teaching and scientific research work, go from not understanding to understanding, from being an amateur to an expert, so that the Party's ideological and political work can be done more vividly, more lively, and more effectively. For teaching staff, it can broaden their horizons and enrich scientific research and teaching content. Trying to cultivate high-yield fields requires comprehensive measures and full implementation of advanced technologies. It requires cooperation in many aspects such as cultivation, soil, pests and diseases, and seeds. These experiments are not only inexperienced for young teachers, but even for experienced old teachers with a certain level of teaching and scientific experiment experience, it may be a new topic. Therefore, running experimental fields well can improve the teaching and scientific research level of the teaching staff, thereby improving the quality of education.
    "Teaching, learning, and farming simultaneously" is the new style of study of socialist agricultural schools. This style of study also helps to eliminate the phenomenon of intellectuals being divorced from manual labor and overcome the influence of the exploiting class's thinking of despising manual laborers. Schools are places of education, and educators must first be educated. School leading cadres and teaching staff taking the lead in farming will also have a great impact on promoting work-study programs and establishing a social atmosphere of valuing labor. It is hoped that the leading cadres of other agricultural schools can also start planting experimental fields themselves based on the characteristics of their own schools.

    试验田是教学联系实际的好办法
    何作
    浙江农学院的领导干部和教学人员走出办公室、实验室，亲自下手去种丰产试验田。这是一件很值得提倡的事情。农业学院的任务是培养有文化有农业知识的农业工作者。什么是有文化有农业知识的农业工作者？这不是指只懂得农业科学知识，而不会种田的人。我们所指的是既有农业科学知识而又有本事种出丰产田的人。这样的毕业生走上农业生产的岗位，就是农业战线上的促进派，农业战线上的好战士。要培养这样的人材，必须从学校开始。过去一般农业院校，对教学联系实际还是比较注意的，但是做得还很不彻底。
    浙江农业学院种试验田，是教学和生产实际相结合，彻底克服关门教书、关门读书、关门做试验研究的好办法。这种做法，对于今后提高学生农业科学知识水平、提高教学质量和科学研究水平将大有裨益。从学校领导干部来说，通过试验田可使领导干部和教学人员打成一片，从事教学和科学研究工作，并具体的领导这一工作前进；党的领导工作人员可以从中学得专业知识，逐步熟悉教学和科学研究工作中的问题，由不懂到懂，由外行到内行，使党的思想政治工作做得更生动、更活泼、更有成效。对于教学人员来说，可以扩大眼界，丰富科学研究和教学内容。试种高额丰产田，需要采取综合性的措施，全面贯彻先进的技术，需要栽培、土壤、病虫害、种子等多方面的配合，这些试验，不仅年青的教师没有经验，就是具有一定教学水平和科学实验经验的老教师，也可能是一个新的课题。因而，办好试验田，就有可能把教学人员的教学和科学研究水平提高一步，从而提高教育质量。
    “边教边学边种田”是社会主义农业学校的新学风，这种学风还有助于消除知识分子脱离体力劳动的现象，克服轻视体力劳动者的剥削阶级思想的影响。学校是教育场所，教育者必须先受教育，学校领导干部和教学人员带头种田，对于推动勤工俭学的开展，树立劳动光荣的风尚，也将发生很大的影响。希望其他一些农业学校的领导干部，也能根据自己学校的特点，亲自动手种起试验田来。
