　　Harbin Holds Employee Speed Skating Postal Competition

    (Our dispatch) Harbin recently held a city-wide employee speed skating postal competition, which was warmly welcomed by the employees. During the month and five days of the competition, a total of 23,625 employees participated in regular exercises and tests. Finally, after evaluation and selection, 1,500 outstanding performers were selected. The Harbin Municipal Sports Commission and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions awarded the "Harbin Employee Speed Skating Postal Competition Winner Commemorative Medal."

    The employee speed skating postal competition has played a positive role in promoting the development of mass ice sports and improving the technical level of sports in Harbin. In order to test the results of employees participating in the postal competition, various grassroots units held small-scale ice speed skating competitions, test sessions, and city-wide ice sports meets. For example, the Harbin Woolen Mill, Dong'an Machinery Factory, and other units held four or five such competitions. In order to help employees achieve good results, technical guidance has also been strengthened. City representative teams and factory representative teams have gone to the grassroots level to guide athletes in practice.

　　哈尔滨举行职工滑冰通讯赛
    本报讯　哈尔滨市最近举办了一次全市职工速度滑冰通讯比赛，这项比赛受到职工群众的热烈欢迎。在一个月零五天的比赛期间内，全市共有二万三千六百二十五名职工参加经常性的锻炼和测验，最后经过评比选拔出一千五百名成绩优秀者。哈尔滨市体委和市工会授给了“哈市职工速度滑冰通讯比赛优胜者纪念章”。
    职工速度滑冰通讯比赛对推动哈市群众性冰上运动的开展和提高运动技术水平起了积极作用。各基层单位为了测验参加通讯比赛职工的成绩，都举办了小型的冰上速滑对抗赛，测验会及全厂性的冰上运动大会。例如：哈尔滨毛织厂，东安机械厂等单位都举行四、五次这样的比赛。为了帮助职工获得良好的成绩，技术指导工作也加强了，市代表队和厂代表队都下基层指导运动员练习。
