    The Red Cross is a Powerful Assistant in the Patriotic Health Campaign
    Joint Speech by Representatives Wu Yunfu, Chen Qiyuan, Liu Qingyang, and Ni Feijun
    We fully support the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. We are all Red Cross workers, please allow us to talk about the domestic work of the Chinese Red Cross Society.
    The Chinese Red Cross Society was originally a pre-existing mass voluntary organization for health and rescue. After the liberation, it was reorganized and filled with new work content. Its main task is to mobilize and organize the masses to learn health knowledge, participate in the patriotic health campaign, and strive to prevent disease and protect physical health; and, according to the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of friendship, mutual assistance, and rescuing the dying and healing the wounded, participate in social service activities. There are currently twenty Red Cross organizations in provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, one hundred and ninety-three Red Cross organizations in cities and counties, approximately ten thousand Red Cross grassroots organizations, and more than thirteen thousand Red Cross health stations. Among the members, there are more than 540,000 Red Cross health workers who have received short-term training.
    Red Cross members and health workers have joined the great ranks of the people of the whole country and are going all out to fight for the Four-Nos Village, Four-Nos City, Four-Nos Province, and Four-Nos Country.
    At present, a massive patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene is being carried out throughout the country. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of the whole country are stirring up revolutionary zeal and are striving to achieve the Four-Nos Village, Four-Nos City, Four-Nos Province, and Four-Nos Country with overwhelming momentum. In this movement, members and health workers of the Chinese Red Cross Society are all going all out without exception and have played an active role. When Beijing launched a concentrated week of the winter patriotic health campaign on December 22 last year, more than 16,000 Red Cross members turned out on the first day, organized 187 propaganda teams, set up 390 broadcasting stations, and 416 propaganda points, and, together with many propaganda teams in the city, carried out propaganda deep into the streets and alleys with waist drums, acrobatics, and bands. Immediately afterwards, more than 100,000 Red Cross members in the city took action. Street offices in many districts organized shock teams with members as the backbone, leading the masses in a general cleaning, clearing garbage, and eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies, sparrows, and rats. For example, the Baochao Hutong office in Dongsi District organized 18 shock teams with a total of 187 people (including 84 members), leading 1,434 people to clean the streets and alleys in the entire jurisdiction. The street office proposed to achieve the Four-Nos by January 25, and the Red Cross members immediately proposed to guarantee that their homes would achieve the Four-Nos five days in advance. They also organized activity groups to take charge of catching rats and sparrows in their areas. Not only Beijing, but also many other places such as Suzhou, Nanjing, Lingling, Xiaogan, Shangrao, Nanchang, Jinan, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Harbin, and Yanji, have used Red Cross members as the main force to organize various shock teams to promote the in-depth development of the movement. According to Wu Boyuan, deputy county magistrate of Macheng County, Hubei Province, at the conference of advanced Red Cross workers in Macheng County: In 1957, 107 shock teams organized by more than 5,700 Red Cross members in the county eliminated a total of 509,060 rats, captured 356,580 sparrows, and killed 755 and a half jin of flies and pupae. In this movement, the smoke fumigation and mosquito and fly elimination work in the Jianggan District of Hangzhou City was led by more than 500 Red Cross members. Some of them even bought coal themselves and went to the homes of the masses to fumigate, doing it quickly and well. In the first stage, more than 33,000 houses were fumigated, basically eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies. In some small county towns and rural areas, Red Cross members, under the slogan of "Supporting the Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production," combined sanitation activities with manure accumulation. According to statistics from sixteen street or agricultural cooperative grassroots Red Cross organizations in Changzhou and other places alone, more than 90,000 dan and more than 7,000 carts of manure have been accumulated in this movement. Red Cross members in Nanjing City challenged fraternal Red Cross organizations in the province with a pledge to achieve "Six-Nos" in 30,000 member families in the city in 1958. Gu De, deputy director of the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, experienced the role of Red Cross members in previous patriotic health campaigns, so he affirmed that "The Red Cross is a powerful assistant in the patriotic health campaign."
    The Red Cross conducts hygiene knowledge education for its members, and they have repeatedly demonstrated their strength in large-scale hygiene movements, not only paying attention to hygiene themselves, but also going deep into every household to mobilize the masses to pay attention to hygiene.
    An important factor for Red Cross members to play an active role in leading the masses in the patriotic health campaign is that after joining the Red Cross Society, the grassroots Red Cross Society systematically conducts hygiene knowledge education and association affairs knowledge education for them through training, lectures, and other methods. After Red Cross members understand why they should pay attention to hygiene and how to pay attention to hygiene, they not only show their strength in large-scale hygiene movements, but also start from themselves, begin to eliminate unhygienic habits, and pay attention to residence, diet, and personal hygiene; and publicize hygiene knowledge to the surrounding masses and help the masses pay attention to hygiene. They live among the masses and are very familiar with the language, living habits, and sanitary conditions of the surrounding masses. They can go deep into every household, connect with reality, publicize and mobilize in a simple and understandable way, and are very popular. There are fifty households in Nanjing's Sitiao Alley. After Red Cross members conducted in-depth publicity on contraception, forty-eight households took contraceptive measures, and the birth rate dropped. In 1953, a total of twenty-six children were born, six in 1956, and only four in 1957. Red Cross members in Dazhi Street, Jiang'an District, Wuhan City, also led the masses to establish a "section responsibility system" for hygiene. Each member led three to five households, formulated a hygiene system and measures to ensure its implementation. Once hygiene work was arranged, the members immediately publicized and mobilized from house to house, and quickly achieved household awareness and everyone's participation. Now the hygiene work in this street has become regularized. The Red Cross work conference in Chengguan Town, Xiaogan, Hubei, summarized the experience under the chairmanship of the town party committee and believed that the Red Cross members have led the masses to pay attention to hygiene, and four major changes have taken place: "Passive becomes active, raids become regular, dirty pits become avenues, and dead corners become paradises." It can be seen that the hygiene publicity and education conducted by the Red Cross for its members and the masses plays an important role in improving people's hygiene knowledge and regularizing hygiene work.
    The Red Cross advocates mutual assistance, friendship, rescuing the dying, and healing the wounded. Its health workers and first-aid stations have selflessly served the injured and sick. Factories and mines have established Red Cross health stations to handle first aid at any time without delaying work hours.
    The Red Cross organization promotes the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of mutual assistance, friendship, rescuing the dying, and healing the wounded. It trains health workers and sets up first-aid stations to serve the people. In Wuxi City, a fisherman's child fell and had a two-inch-long cut on the head, and the skull was visible. The situation was very urgent. Shen Xiangxiu, a Red Cross health worker (student) from the Second Middle School, rushed to give first aid and escorted the child to the hospital for further suturing treatment; at the same time, in order to help the fisherman overcome the economic difficulties at the time, Shen Xiangxiu also gave her the two yuan subsidy she had just received as treatment expenses. The fisherman shed tears of gratitude at the time, and the surrounding masses expressed respect for Shen Xiangxiu's spirit and deeply felt the nobility and glory of Red Cross activities. In Liming Street, Jinan City, Zong Fengyuan, a sixty-seven-year-old martyr's family member, suddenly relapsed and was bedridden. He was alone. The Red Cross health workers on this street automatically organized a team. Several Red Cross health workers took turns on duty, taking care of the old man day and night, and also asked for medicine and bought medicine, and served him food and removed his waste. After half a month, they also helped the old man find relatives and took him back to his hometown. The neighbors praised them and said that Red Cross health workers do not dislike dirt or fatigue, and even their own children would not do so well. The above are just two examples at random, and there are many such examples among Red Cross members and health workers. Many of them are not afraid of hardship, do not want remuneration, and selflessly serve the injured and sick, regardless of the wind and rain. Some deeds are admirable. This is a new moral force manifested through Red Cross activities under the socialist system, and it is also an inexhaustible force for Red Cross organizations in health work and rescue activities. In addition, due to the first-aid activities of Red Cross health workers, general trauma can be prevented from infection, and acute diseases can be prevented from endangering life due to delayed time. This plays a certain role in ensuring the health of the masses and alleviating the pain of injuries and diseases, and also reduces the outpatient burden of medical staff, which is also of great benefit to production and construction. According to incomplete statistics from nineteen Red Cross health stations in the Tianshifu Coal Mine of the Benxi Mining Bureau, in 1957, they handled a total of 13,026 cases of trauma and first aid, of which 55% needed to go to the above-ground medical room, but because there were Red Cross health stations, they could be treated at any time underground without delaying production time. If each person saves two hours of going up and down the well, it will save the country 1,791 workdays. Calculated according to the average minimum coal production of two tons per workday, it is equivalent to increasing the production of raw coal by 3,582 tons. This is only the statistics of one coal mine in one year. If such organizations are established in industrial units throughout the country, this will be a very large figure.
    Red Cross members assist local and workshop doctors in their work and act as powerful assistants, making great contributions to the discovery, control, and treatment of diseases. Red Cross children have done a lot of work in health education and disease prevention.
    Red Cross members and health workers are also playing an active role in eliminating diseases. After short-term training, they can generally, under the guidance of doctors and through the activities of grassroots Red Cross organizations, assist local or workshop doctors in many tasks such as epidemic reporting, home care, disease investigation, patient isolation, epidemic area disinfection, drinking water disinfection, environmental disinfection, vaccination, maternal and child health care, and distribution of disease prevention drugs. Therefore, local doctors have assistants, and the discovery, control, and treatment of diseases are greatly facilitated. Malaria was prevalent in Taohua Township, Nanchang City, in the past. After the establishment of the Red Cross organization in 1957, the township health center used this force to do a good job in epidemic reporting and drug prevention. The members "delivered the preventive drugs to the door and watched them take them." In that year, the incidence rate dropped by 85%. Shao Mingjun, a local doctor in Heping Street, Wanghua District, Fushun City, used to be overwhelmed when vaccinating, and he also had to mobilize all the doctors and nurses in the outpatient department of a factory in the area to stop their work for a few days to assist. Since the establishment of the Red Cross organization, this doctor, with the assistance of Red Cross health workers, has been able to vaccinate more than 380 children in a shorter period of time, and the pox rate is above 95%. Therefore, he said that Red Cross members have added many convenient conditions to his work. In addition, in many places such as Hangzhou, Shanghai, Qingpu, Wuxi, and Nanjing, Red Cross members have also done a lot of work they can do in schistosomiasis prevention and control.
    The Red Cross has also developed Red Cross juvenile members in many local primary and secondary schools, aiming to cultivate good habits of paying attention to hygiene and establishing a humanitarian spirit of mutual assistance, friendship, rescuing the dying, and healing the wounded among young people from an early age. These Red Cross children have carried out many hygiene publicity and disease prevention activities in schools, and also assisted school doctors in trachoma correction and physical examinations. After learning hygiene knowledge in Red Cross activities, young people also go home to urge their families to pay attention to hygiene. Recently, when launching the campaign to discourage spitting everywhere in Beijing, Nanchang, Suzhou, Harbin, and other places, Red Cross children have become the vanguard of the movement, launching persuasion activities to the masses on the streets and receiving good results.
    Using Red Cross organizations to organize the masses to pay attention to hygiene can do more with less money, and even do many things without spending money. It is hoped that all sectors of society will value and support this organization so that it can play a greater role in the great struggle of paying attention to hygiene, eliminating diseases, changing customs, and transforming the country.
    As mentioned above, it is obvious that the Red Cross can be regarded as a bridge between the health department and the masses and an assistant for carrying out mass health work. At present, strengthening the work of the Red Cross and developing the organization of the Red Cross is conducive to implementing the policy of "prevention first" and "combining health work with mass movements." From the perspective of building the country diligently and thriftily and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, it is impossible and should not be entirely funded by the state to run mass health undertakings, whether now or in the future. If Red Cross organizations are used to let the masses organize themselves to learn hygiene and pay attention to hygiene, they can do more with less money, and even do things without spending money. The power of the masses is great. Our health undertakings are for the masses and must rely on the masses, so we should mobilize the power of the masses to organize and run the health undertakings of the masses.
    In short, the Red Cross is a people's organization that promotes hygiene and humanity, and is a force for the people of our country to fight against the pain of disease. All its activities are to serve the people's health, to serve socialist construction, and to serve the progress and civilization of mankind. This is a mass health and welfare undertaking. However, because our domestic work started late, we have very little work experience, and the organization has not yet been universally developed. Therefore, all its activities require the active participation of the broad masses and the attention and support of all sectors of society. We sincerely hope that all the representatives will give this undertaking care and support, so that it can play a greater role in carrying out the regular patriotic health movement of the masses, in paying attention to hygiene, eliminating diseases, changing customs, and transforming the country.

    红十字会是爱国卫生运动的有力助手
    伍云甫　陈其瑗　刘清扬　倪斐君代表的联合发言
    我们完全拥护李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的各项报告。我们都是红十字工作者，请允许我们谈谈中国红十字会的国内业务工作的情况。
    中国红十字会本是旧有的群众自愿组织的卫生救护团体，解放后，经过改组，充实了新的工作内容，它的主要任务是动员和组织群众学习卫生知识，参加爱国卫生运动，为预防疾病保护身体健康而斗争；并根据友爱互助、救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神，参加社会服务活动。全国现有省、自治区、直辖市红十字会组织二十个，市、县红十字会组织一百九十三个，红十字基层组织约一万个，红十字卫生站一万三千多个。会员中，受过短期训练的红十字卫生员有五十四万多人。
    红十字会员和卫生员，参加了全国人民的伟大行列，全力以赴，为四无乡、四无城、四无省、四无国而奋斗。
    目前，全国正在开展一个规模巨大的除四害、讲卫生的爱国卫生运动，全国人民在党和政府的领导下，鼓起革命干劲，正以排山倒海之势，为争取实现四无乡、四无城、四无省、四无国而努力。在这个运动中，中国红十字会的会员、卫生员，都是毫无例外地全力以赴，并且起了积极的作用。去年十二月二十二日起，北京市开展冬季爱国卫生运动突击周的时候，第一天红十字会员就出动了一万六千多人，组织了一百八十七个宣传大队，设立了三百九十个广播站、四百一十六个宣传点，配合腰鼓、杂技、乐队等和市内许多宣传队伍一道，深入大街小巷展开宣传。紧接着，全市十万多名红十字会员就行动起来，许多区的街道以会员为骨干组织突击队，带动群众大扫除，清除垃圾，消灭越冬蚊蝇和麻雀、老鼠。例如东四区宝钞胡同办事处组织了十八个突击队，共一百八十七人（其中会员八十四人）带动一千四百三十四人，清扫了全管界的街巷；街办事处提出要在一月二十五日作到四无，红十字会员们即提出保证自己家里提前五天作到四无，他们还组织了活动小组，包干负责，捕打本片的老鼠和麻雀。不仅北京如此，其他如苏州、南京、零陵、孝感、上饶、南昌、济南、杭州、青岛、哈尔滨、延吉等许多地方，都运用红十字会员为主要力量，组织各种突击队推动运动的深入开展。据湖北麻城县副县长吴伯原在麻城县先进红十字工作者大会上指出：一九五七年全县五千七百多红十字会员组织的一百零七个突击队，共灭鼠五十万九千零六十只，捕雀三十五万六千五百八十只，灭蝇挖蛹七百五十五斤半。这次运动中，杭州市江干区全区的烟熏灭蚊蝇工作，是由五百多个红十字会员带头干的，他们有的还自己买煤炭到群众家去熏，做得又快又好，第一阶段共熏房屋三万三千多间，已基本上消灭了越冬蚊蝇。在一些小县城及农村，红十字会员们以“支援农业生产大跃进”为口号，将卫生活动与积肥结合起来，仅据常州等地十六个街道或农业社的基层红十字会的统计，在这次运动中已经积肥九万多担又七千多车。南京市的红十字会员们以一九五八年内全市三万个会员家庭达到“六无”的誓言，向全省兄弟红十字会挑战。北京市爱国卫生运动委员会副主任顾德经过历次爱国卫生运动，体会到红十字会员的作用，因而他肯定地认为：“红十字会是爱国卫生运动的有力助手”。
    红十字会对广大会员进行卫生知识教育，他们在大规模卫生运动中一再显示力量，不仅自己讲卫生，而且深入每家每户，动员群众讲卫生。
    红十字会员所以在爱国卫生运动中能够带动群众起积极作用，一个重要因素是他们在参加红十字会以后，基层红十字会就有组织、有系统地通过训练、讲座等多种办法，经常对他们进行卫生知识教育和会务知识教育。红十字会员在懂得了为甚么要讲卫生和怎样讲卫生的道理以后，不仅在大规模的卫生运动中显示出他们的力量，而且首先从他们自身做起，开始革除不卫生的习惯，注意居住、饮食和个人卫生；并向周围群众宣传卫生知识，帮助群众讲究卫生，他们生活在群众之中，非常熟悉周围群众的语言、生活习惯和卫生状况，他们能深入每家每户，联系实际，宣传动员，通俗易懂，很受欢迎。南京市四条巷有五十户人家，经过红十字会员深入宣传避孕以后，四十八户采取了避孕措施，出生率下降了，一九五三年共生二十六个小孩，一九五六年生了六个，一九五七年只生了四个。武汉市江岸区大智街的红十字会员还带动群众建立了讲卫生的“地段责任制”，每个会员带动三到五户，订立了卫生制度及保证贯彻的办法，一有卫生工作布置下来，会员们即挨家挨户宣传与发动，很快就达到家喻户晓，人人动手。现在这个街的卫生工作已经走上经常化。湖北孝感城关镇红十字会工作会议，在镇党委的主持下总结了经验，认为由于红十字会员带动群众讲卫生，已经发生了四大变化：“消极变积极，突击变经常，污坑变大道，死角变乐园。”可以看出，红十字会对会员群众进行的卫生宣传教育，在提高人民卫生知识和使卫生工作经常化方面，有重要作用。
    红十字会提倡互助友爱救死扶伤，它的卫生员和急救站曾忘我地为伤病人服务；厂矿建立了红十字卫生站，随时处理急救，不误工时。
    红十字组织是提倡互助友爱、救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神的。它训练卫生员，设立急救站为人民服务。在无锡市，有一个渔妇的孩子头部跌了二寸多长的口子，已见到颅骨，情势很紧急，第二中学红十字卫生员（学生）沈祥秀听到这消息后，立即赶去作了急救处理，并且护送到医院作了进一步的缝合治疗；同时，为了帮助渔妇克服当时的经济困难，沈祥秀还把刚领到的两元助学金送给她作治疗费用，渔妇当时流下了感激的眼泪，周围群众对沈祥秀这种精神表示尊敬，深感红十字活动的高尚和光荣。在济南市离明街，一位六十七岁的烈属宗逢元突然旧病复发，卧床不起，他是孤身一人，这个街上的红十字卫生员们自动组织了一个小组，几个红十字卫生员轮流值班，不分昼夜的护理老人，还请医买药，端屎端尿，经过半月之久，还帮老人找来亲属，接他回老家。街坊们称赞他们说，红十字卫生员不嫌脏不嫌累，亲儿亲女也不过如此。以上只不过随便举出的两个事例，红十字会员和卫生员中有不少这样的事例。他们之中有许多人不怕辛苦，不要报酬，不管风里雨里，忘我地为伤病人服务，有些事迹是可歌可泣的。这是在社会主义制度下，通过红十字会活动所表现出来的新的道德力量，也是红十字组织在卫生工作和救护活动中取之不竭的力量。此外，由于红十字卫生员的急救活动，一般外伤可免致感染，急病可不致因时间延误发生生命危险。这在保障群众健康，减轻伤病痛苦上有一定作用，同时也减轻医务人员的门诊负担，对生产建设也大有好处。据本溪矿务局田师傅煤矿十九个红十字卫生站不完全的统计，一九五七年全年他们共处理外伤和急救一万三千零二十六人次，其中百分之五十五需要到井上医务室去，但因有了红十字卫生站，可以在井下随时得到处理，不耽误生产时间，若以每人上井下井节省两小时计算，给国家少浪费一千七百九十一个工作日，按每个工作日平均最低产煤两吨计算，等于增产了原煤三千五百八十二吨。这仅是一个煤矿一年的统计，如果全国工业单位都建立了这种组织，这将是一笔很大的数字。
    红十字会员，协助地段和车间医生工作，充当了有力的助手，对疾病的发现、控制和治疗，贡献很大。红十字少年在卫生宣传和疾病预防方面做了不少工作。
    红十字会员和卫生员们在消灭疾病方面，也起着积极的作用。他们经过短期训练后，一般能在医生的指导下，通过红十字基层组织的活动，协助地段或车间医生作疫情报告、家庭护理、病情调查、病人隔离、疫地消毒、饮水消毒、环境消毒、预防接种、妇幼保健，以及分发预防疾病的药品等许多工作。因此，使地段医生有了助手，对疾病的发现、控制和治疗，都得到很多方便。南昌市桃花乡，过去疟疾严重流行，一九五七年建立红十字组织后，乡卫生所运用这批力量做好疫情报告、服药预防两项工作，由会员把预防药物“送上门，看着吃”，当年发病率降低了百分之八十五。抚顺市望花区和平街地段医师邵明俊过去种痘时，一个人忙得焦头烂额，还要动员地段内一个工厂门诊部的全体医生、护士停诊几天来协助，自从建立了红十字组织后，这位大夫在红十字卫生员的协助下，就能在更短日子内使三百八十多个孩子都种上了牛痘，出痘率在百分之九十五以上。所以他说，红十字会员给他的工作增加了很多便利条件。此外，在杭州、上海、青浦、无锡、南京等许多地方，红十字会员在血吸虫病防治工作中，也做了许多他们可以作的工作。
    红十字会还在许多地方的中小学校中，发展了红十字少年会员，目的在于自小就培养青少年们讲究卫生的良好习惯，树立起互助友爱，救死扶伤的人道主义精神。这些红十字少年们在学校中进行了许多卫生宣传和疾病预防工作，还协助校医作砂眼矫治、体格检查。青少年们在红十字活动中学到卫生知识以后，还回家督促家庭讲究卫生。最近在北京、南昌、苏州、哈尔滨等地开展劝止随地吐痰运动时，红十字少年们成了运动的先锋队，在街道上向群众展开劝说活动，收到很好的效果。
    运用红十字组织，组织群众讲卫生可以少花钱多办事，甚至不花钱也能办许多事。希望社会各个方面重视和支持这个组织，让它在讲究卫生、消灭疾病，移风易俗，改造国家的伟大斗争中发挥更大的作用。
    如上所述，很显然，红十字会是可以当作卫生部门一种联系群众的桥梁和开展群众卫生工作的助手的。目前加强红十字会工作，发展红十字会的组织，是有利于贯彻“预防为主”和“卫生工作同群众运动相结合”的方针的。再从勤俭建国，勤俭办一切事业的方针来考虑，不论在目前或将来要完全由国家出钱出人来办群众卫生事业是不可能的也是不应该的，如果运用红十字组织，让群众自己组织起来学习卫生、讲究卫生，就可以少花钱多办事，甚至不花钱也能办事。群众的力量是伟大的。我们的卫生事业为了群众，必须依靠群众，因此应该发动群众力量组织起来办理群众的卫生事业。
    总之，红十字会是一个讲卫生、讲人道的人民团体，是我国人民对疾病痛苦作斗争的一支力量。它的一切活动，是为人民健康服务，为社会主义建设服务，为人类的进步和文明服务。这是一种人民群众的卫生福利事业。但由于我们国内业务工作开展得迟，我们的工作经验还很少，组织还没有普遍发展。因此它的一切活动需要广大群众的积极参加，需要社会各个方面的重视和支持。我们衷心地希望各位代表同志给这个事业以关怀和赞助，让它在开展群众经常的爱国卫生运动中，在讲究卫生，消灭疾病，移风易俗，改造国家的伟大工作中，发挥更大的作用。
