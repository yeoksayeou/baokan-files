    Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant Plans to Build New Workshop
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 1st. The state-owned Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, currently under construction, recently decided to add a workshop dedicated to producing feed-grade tricalcium phosphate. Once completed and put into operation this year, the workshop will have an annual output of 6,000 tons of tricalcium phosphate, enough to feed 270,000 cattle, 830,000 pigs, or 11.1 million chickens and ducks for a year. Tricalcium phosphate is very cheap, estimated to cost only 25 cents per catty.
    Feed-grade tricalcium phosphate, also known as defluorinated superphosphate of lime, is a milky white powder with no odor. It contains large amounts of calcium and phosphorus, which can promote the development and growth of livestock and poultry, and is an excellent mineral feed.

　　生产化学饲料
    南京磷肥厂筹建新车间
    据新华社南京1日电　兴建中的国营南京磷肥厂最近决定增添一座专门生产饲料磷酸三钙的车间。这个车间今年建成投入生产后，年产六千吨磷酸三钙，可以供二十七万头牛或八十三万头猪、一千一百一十万只鸡鸭食用一年。磷酸三钙很便宜，估计一斤只要二角五分可以买到。
    饲料磷酸三钙又名脱氟过磷酸钙，是一种乳白色的粉状物，没有异味。它含有大量的钙、磷，能促进家畜家禽的发育成长，是优良矿物饲料。
