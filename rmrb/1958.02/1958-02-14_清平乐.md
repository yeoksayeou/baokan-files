    Baoji-Chengdu Railway

    The Qinling Mountains are so beautiful, with iron belts tightly wrapped around their waists.
    The Jialing River water roars in vain, as the train goes straight up to the clouds.
    The Ba Mountains submit and bow their heads, as the heroic people open the way.
    Recalling the fierce battles in Guang'an and Mianyang in the past, we rejoice in today's surpassing of San Dao!

    清平乐
    傅钟
    宝成路
    秦岭多娇，铁带紧缠腰。
    嘉陵江水空咆哮，火车直上云霄。
    巴山服膺俯首，英雄人民开道。
    忆昔鏖战广沔，喜今赛绝三岛！
