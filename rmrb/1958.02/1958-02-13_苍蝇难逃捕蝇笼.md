Flies Cannot Escape the Fly Trap

　　There was a robust old man in his fifties repairing a road. He carried bricks back and forth, resting when he was tired, and then taking out a fly swatter from his basket. Even though it was winter, he could still find a few flies sunning themselves on the walls where there was no breeze! Smack! Smack! In this way, he killed fifteen hundred flies in five days. He is Jiang Lunlong, a first-class model of patriotic hygiene and a fly-catching expert in Nanjing.

　　During the summer, when flies are most active, Jiang Lunlong doesn't use this "handicraft" method of catching flies; he uses his own invented "fly trap." This kind of trap can catch almost a rice bowl full of flies in a day. Early in the morning, he places eleven fly traps next to street toilets and garbage dumps, and at night he collects them and kills the flies with DDT. After four or five days, the dead flies fill up a tin bucket. In two years, he caught four hundred and eight catties of flies. (Xu Wanying)

    苍蝇难逃捕蝇笼
    有一位五十多岁壮健的老人在修路。他挑着砖头来去，累了，就放下担子歇一歇，随即从筐里抽出一只蝇拍，虽然已是冬天，但在不通风的墙壁上还能找到几只苍蝇在晒太阳呢！拍！拍！就这样在五天中打死了一千五百个苍蝇。他就是南京市一等爱国卫生模范、捕蝇能手江伦龙。
    在苍蝇大肆活动的夏天，江伦龙可不是用这种“手工业”方式捕蝇的，他用自己创造的“捕蝇笼”。这种笼子一天可捉到将近一饭碗的苍蝇。一清早，他用十一个捕蝇笼放在街上厕所、垃圾堆的旁边，晚上收回来用滴滴涕打死。过了四、五天，死苍蝇就装满了一洋铁铅桶。两年中，他捉到苍蝇四百零八斤。（许宛英）
