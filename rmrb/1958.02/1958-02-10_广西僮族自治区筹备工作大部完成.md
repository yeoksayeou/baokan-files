Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, February 9th: The various preparatory tasks for the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have been largely completed after more than five months of active preparation. Currently, basic-level elections in cities and counties throughout the province have largely concluded. Before the 15th, each city and county will convene its People's Congress meeting to elect deputies to the first People's Congress of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

The Autonomous Region Economic and Cultural Exhibition Hall and the Guangxi Nearly Century Revolutionary Relics Exhibition Hall have both been basically completed. They are currently being furnished with various exhibits and landscaping. These two exhibition halls will display a large number of historical relics related to the revolutionary struggles of people of all ethnic groups and various physical objects, models, and charts illustrating the economic and cultural construction achievements of Guangxi since liberation eight years ago.

More than 130,000 copies of publicity outlines and materials concerning the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and related ethnic policies have been distributed throughout the province. The Guangxi Daily and newspapers in various cities and special districts have all devoted special columns to publishing articles promoting the establishment of the autonomous region.

As early as October 1956, Guangxi began to deliberate the establishment of a Zhuang autonomous region at the provincial level. During this time, the Guangxi provincial Party and government leadership held symposiums with upper-level figures from various ethnic groups, convened the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and widely conducted report meetings and symposiums in provinces, cities, counties, and towns to conduct democratic consultations on issues such as the name of the autonomous region. In particular, after the rectification campaign thoroughly criticized the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of bourgeois rightists on the issue of ethnic regional autonomy, the socialist consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups was greatly enhanced, and a consensus was reached on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The Provincial People's Congress and the People's Congresses of various cities and counties have all passed resolutions expressing their unanimous support.

    早在1956年10月份，广西就开始酝酿成立省一级的僮族自治区。在这时间，广西省党政领导方面，举行了各民族上层人士座谈会，召开了政协广西省委员会，并在省、市、县及各城镇普遍举行了报告会、座谈会，对自治区的名称等问题，广泛地进行了民主协商，特别是经过整风运动，彻底批判了资产阶级右派分子在民族区域自治问题上的反共反社会主义的言行后，各族人民的社会主义觉悟大大提高，对成立广西僮族自治区取得了一致的意见。省人民代表大会和各市、县人民代表大会都做出决议，表示一致拥护。
