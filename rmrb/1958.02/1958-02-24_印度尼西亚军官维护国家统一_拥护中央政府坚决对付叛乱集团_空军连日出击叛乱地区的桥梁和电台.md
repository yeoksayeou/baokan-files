Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 23rd - Officers of the Indonesian armed forces stationed in the Jakarta area held a gathering on the 22nd to express their support for the central government and condemn the Padang rebel group.

Rear Admiral Subono, representing the officers, read out a statement advocating appropriate action against the Hussein rebel group. The statement said, "For us, there is no compromise, and no other way."

The statement said that the activities of the rebels greatly benefited the Dutch colonialists but harmed the interests of the Indonesian nation and people, and betrayed the constitution and the people.

The statement said that all officers stationed in the Jakarta area clearly stated that they firmly opposed and condemned the Padang rebel group, composed of elements that hindered national unity, and they fully supported the policies implemented by the Juanda government and the armed forces leadership. They stated that they would always be loyal to the declaration of independence of the Republic of Indonesia.

About one thousand officers attended the gathering, including the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Air Force, officers from various leadership organs of the Jakarta armed forces, and Jakarta garrison officers. Army Chief of Staff Nasution reported on the current situation in Indonesia at the meeting.

Meanwhile, the Indonesian National Front for the Liberation of West Irian, chaired by Nasution, issued a statement on the 21st saying that the Hussein rebel group's establishment of an illegal "government" clearly helped Dutch colonialists maintain their rule in West Irian. The National Front pointed out that Sjafruddin, before fleeing to Padang, had engaged in activities that undermined the Indonesian people's struggle against Dutch colonialism and had helped Dutch colonialists economically. The National Front called on the people and armed forces to eliminate these rebels and to strengthen unity to oppose Dutch colonialists and their accomplices.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 22nd - The Indonesian Air Force Press Office announced that Indonesian aircraft attacked Padang Radio and Bukittinggi Radio on the 22nd. The results were good. Jakarta could not hear the broadcasts from these two radio stations in the rebel areas that evening.

The Air Force Press Office said that since the 21st, the Air Force had been taking action against the rebel group in Central Sumatra, such as bombing bridges. To prevent harm to residents near the bombed targets, the Air Force first fired warning shots to allow residents to take shelter before attacking.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 23rd - The Indonesian "Sunday Star" revealed today that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) is using weapons to aid the Padang Hussein rebel group, and in recent months, has illegally smuggled weapons, including various types of machine guns and anti-aircraft guns, into Central Sumatra. In addition, SEATO has also sent instructors to Central Sumatra to train the rebel army. The newspaper said that this was the result of a meeting between the Hussein group and some leading figures of SEATO stationed in Singapore.

The newspaper said that the Singapore "Straits Times" recently published some photos of armored vehicles, with the caption: "These armored vehicles will be sent to the Hussein group." The newspaper learned that these armored vehicles were allocated by SEATO from its military equipment storage in Singapore.

According to "Sunday News," the Hussein group now has four new types of anti-aircraft guns, which were shipped from Singapore on a British ship at the end of January. The instructors training to use these anti-aircraft guns are English-speaking Caucasians.

At the same time, the "Sunday Star" reported that the people of Central Sumatra are rising up against the Hussein group. Organizations against the Hussein group have been established in Payakumbuh, Muara, and other cities. Some army units loyal to the central government have joined forces with the people to fight against the rebel group. In the Manado area of North Sulawesi, activities against the Somba group are also developing.

    拥护中央政府坚决对付叛乱集团
    空军连日出击叛乱地区的桥梁和电台
    新华社雅加达23日电　驻在雅加达地区的印度尼西亚武装部队的军官22日举行集会，表示拥护中央政府和谴责巴东叛乱集团。
    宋科诺海军准将代表军官们宣读了一篇声明，主张采取适当的行动来对付侯赛尼叛乱集团。声明说：“对我们来说，是没有让步、也没有其他办法的”。
    声明说，叛乱分子的活动对荷兰殖民主义者大为有利，但是损害了印度尼西亚国家和人民的利益，并且背叛了宪法和人民。
    声明说，所有驻雅加达地区的军官明白表示，他们坚决地反对和谴责那些妨碍国家统一的分子所组成的巴东叛乱集团，他们完全支持朱安达政府和武装部队领导所执行的政策。他们表示不论什么时候都忠于印度尼西亚共和国的独立宣言。
    参加集会的约有一千名军官，其中包括陆军和空军参谋长、雅加达武装部队各领导机关的军官和雅加达驻军军官。陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安在集会上就印度尼西亚当前局势作了报告。
    同时，由纳苏蒂安任主席的印度尼西亚争取解放西伊里安民族阵线在21日发表声明说，侯赛尼叛逆集团成立非法的“政府”，显然有助于荷兰殖民主义者保持他们在西伊里安的统治。民族阵线指出，沙弗鲁丁在逃往巴东以前曾经进行过破坏印度尼西亚人民反对荷兰殖民主义的斗争的活动，并且在经济方面帮助过荷兰殖民主义者。民族阵线要求人民和武装部队消灭这些叛乱分子，并且以增强团结来反对荷兰殖民主义者和他们的同伙。
    新华社雅加达22日电　印度尼西亚空军新闻处宣布，印度尼西亚飞机22日袭击了巴东电台和武吉丁宜电台。结果很好。雅加达当天晚间已经听不到叛乱地区的这两个电台的广播。
    空军新闻处说，从21日起，空军部队就已经对中苏门答腊叛乱集团采取行动，例如轰炸桥梁等。为了使被轰炸的目标附近的居民不受伤害，空军部队在袭击之前，先放枪警告居民，让他们躲避起来。
    新华社雅加达23日电　印度尼西亚“星期日明星报”今天揭露，东南亚条约组织用武器来援助巴东侯赛尼叛乱集团，在最近几个月内，非法偷运了包括各种类型的机关枪和高射炮在内的武器进入中苏门答腊。此外，东南亚条约组织还派遣了教官到中苏门答腊去训练叛乱军队。报纸说，这是侯赛尼集团同驻在新加坡的东南亚条约组织的一些首要分子会谈的结果。
    这家报纸说，新加坡的“海峡时报”最近刊载了一些装甲车的照片，说明文字写道：“这些装甲车将运送给侯赛尼集团”。这家报纸获悉，这些装甲车是东南亚条约组织从它在新加坡的军事装备储存中调拨出来的。
    据“星期日新闻”报道，侯赛尼集团现在拥有四门新型的高射炮，这些高射炮是1月底用英国船只从新加坡运去的。训练使用这些高射炮的教官是操英语的白种人。
    同时，“星期日明星报”报道，中苏门答腊人民正在起来反抗侯赛尼集团。在巴雅公务、宁岳和其他城市建立了反对侯赛尼集团的组织。一些忠于中央政府的陆军部队同人民联合起来向叛乱集团进行斗争。在北苏拉威西的万鸦老地区，反对宋巴集团的活动也正在发展。
