　　Sleeping Posture
　　Liu Youchang
    When the topic of people's sleeping postures comes up, some people will recall that, whether it was in novels, poetry, paintings, sculptural art, movies, dramas, or some other art form, this scene has been depicted more than once. Therefore, they feel as if only writers and artists would pay attention to this topic. Little do they know that I, a person who studies physiology and hygiene, also want to talk about this topic. However, writers and artists talk about it from an aesthetic point of view, while I can only talk about it from a health perspective.
    Sleeping postures are diverse, but they fall within three basic categories: sleeping on your back, sleeping on your side, and sleeping on your stomach. Everyone has their own preferred sleeping posture. There is nothing wrong with lying in whatever way feels comfortable. However, inappropriate sleeping postures can affect your health, or at least prevent you from maintaining vigorous energy the next day.
    Let's start with infants. An infant's sleeping posture is the most important thing to pay attention to, because many of the bones in an infant's head have not yet grown and hardened, and they cannot turn themselves over. For this reason, infants should not be allowed to sleep on one side all the time. Adults should help them alternate between sleeping on their left side, right side, and on their back. Otherwise, the bones of the infant's head will become deformed.
    The sleeping postures of healthy children and adults do not generally need to be strictly regulated, but sleeping on the stomach should be avoided as much as possible. Sleeping on the stomach puts too much pressure on the chest, hindering breathing and heart function. If children are found to have this sleeping posture, attention should be paid to correcting it. Sleeping on your side and sleeping on your back are better sleeping postures, but sleeping on your back is generally considered better because it is most natural for the muscles and organs of the body.
    After lunch, it is best to sleep on your back or on your right side, because the stomach is in the left abdomen. Sleeping on your left side will compress the stomach, which is not conducive to digestion.
    Elderly people or people with heart disease are not suitable for sleeping on their left side, also because the heart is on the left side. Sleeping on the left side puts pressure on the heart, hindering its function, and is also prone to causing nightmares.
    The sleeping posture of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis is also worth noting. People with lesions in both lungs are most suitable for sleeping on their back. People with lesions in one lung are suitable for both sleeping on their back and sleeping on their side, but when sleeping on their side, the side with the lesions should be lying down. In this way, the lung on the affected side will be under pressure, reducing its work and increasing its rest, which is conducive to recovery. Many people mistakenly believe that the affected side should not be pressed down and instead lie on the healthy side. As a result, the healthy lung is under pressure, reducing its working capacity, which increases the workload on the affected lung, which is very detrimental to the condition.
    Finally, I would also like to talk about beds and pillows. Some people mistakenly believe that wire beds or Simmons mattresses are the most comfortable. In fact, this is not the case. When sleeping on a wire bed or Simmons mattress, no matter what posture you take, the middle of the body sinks down, forming an arc. The muscles on the upper side of the body can relax, but the part of the body resting on the bed is tightened, and the chest and abdominal organs are under pressure, preventing them from resting. These types of beds and mattresses are expensive but not practical, and are far less comfortable than a wooden bed covered with straw or cotton padding. Many people in the Jiangnan region sleep on palm beds, which are flat but not hard, making them relatively ideal. As for pillows, they do not need to be too soft. The purpose of using a pillow is to put the head at an appropriate height so that the muscles of the neck and back can relax and rest. When sleeping on your back, the pillow should not be too high to avoid tightening the muscles of the neck and back. Some people do not use a pillow when lying on their back; when sleeping on your side, the pillow should not be too low, otherwise the head will droop and one side of the neck muscles will be tightened.

　　睡姿
　　刘有常
    提起人的睡眠姿势，有人就会忆起，不知是在小说还是诗、画、造形艺术、电影、戏剧等哪一类艺术形态里，曾经不止一次地描绘过这种镜头，因而觉得，仿佛只有文学家、艺术家才会注意到这个题目。殊不知我这研究生理卫生的人，也要来谈谈这个题目。不过，文学、艺术家们是从美的角度来谈的，我却只能从健康的角度来谈。
    睡眠的姿势多种多样，但不出三个基本范围，即仰睡、侧睡、俯睡。各人都有各自喜欢的睡姿，只要觉得怎么躺着舒服就怎么躺，这本无可非议。但是，不适当的睡姿，却会影响健康，至少是不能使翌日的精力保持旺盛。
    先从婴儿谈起。婴儿的睡姿是最值得关心的，因为婴儿头部的许多骨胳都还没有长成和硬化，而他自己又不会翻身。为此，不能让婴儿固定睡一边，大人要帮助他轮流向左侧睡、右侧睡和向天睡。否则，婴儿的头部骨胳会畸形。
    健康的儿童和成人的睡姿，一般不用严格规定，但是应尽量避免俯睡。俯睡会使胸部压得太紧，妨碍呼吸和心脏工作。发现儿童有这种睡姿时，就应注意纠正。侧睡和仰睡是较好的睡姿，不过一般认为仰睡更好些，因为它最顺乎身体各部肌肉和器官的自然。
    饭后睡午觉，最好仰睡或向右侧睡，因为胃在左腹部。向左侧睡会压迫胃，不利于消化。
    上了年纪或心脏有病的人，不适合向左侧睡，这也因为心脏在左边，左侧睡使心脏受压迫，妨碍心脏的工作，而且容易引起噩梦。
    肺结核患者的睡姿也很值得注意。两侧肺部都有病变的人，最适宜仰睡。一侧肺部有病变的人，既适于仰睡也适于侧睡，但侧睡时应将病变的一侧睡在下面。这样病变一侧的肺部因为受到压迫，工作减少而休息增多，有利于恢复健康。很多人误以为有病的一侧不能再去压它，而将好的一侧睡在下面，结果好的肺受到压迫而工作能力减少，反而加重了病变一侧肺部的工作，这对病情是十分不利的。
    最后，还要顺便谈一下床铺和枕头。有人误以为钢丝床或席梦思床最舒服。其实不然。睡钢丝床或席梦思床垫，不论采取哪一种姿势，身体中段下陷，构成弧形，身体上边的筋肉可以放松，身体下边靠床的部分却被拉紧，胸部和腹内脏器又受到压迫，得不到休息。这类床和垫子价格昂贵，而不实用，远不如铺了稻草或棉垫的木板床好。江南很多人睡棕棚床，这种床平而不硬，比较理想。至于枕头，也不必太软。用枕的目的是要把头放在适当的高度，使颈、背部的肌肉放松，得到休息。仰睡时，用枕不宜高，以免项背部肌肉拉紧，也有人仰卧时不用枕；侧睡时，枕不宜太低，否则头向下垂，一侧颈肌拉紧。
