    Main Indicators of Railway Transportation

    Travel Speed: The average number of kilometers a train travels per hour within a section. For example, if the distance between Beijing and Tianjin is 140 kilometers and a train travels for four hours, the average speed is 35 kilometers per hour. This also includes the time spent at each station for passengers to board and disembark, and for loading and unloading goods.

    Freight Car Single Intermediate Station Dwell Time: After a freight car is hauled to a sectional station, it needs to be disassembled, rearranged, or have its locomotive changed, but the crew continues to travel, and there is no loading or unloading relationship with this station. The time spent in this way is called the freight car single intermediate station dwell time.

    Single Freight Handling Dwell Time: All the time consumed by a vehicle at a station for loading or unloading goods.

    Freight Car Static Load: The average tonnage of goods loaded per freight car.

    Locomotive Daily Car Kilometers: The average number of kilometers traveled by each operational locomotive per day.

    Average Gross Train Weight: The average weight of the goods and freight car tare weight pulled by each train, excluding the locomotive's own weight.

    On-Time Rate of Freight Trains: The percentage of trains departing from a sectional station at the time specified by the timetable out of all freight trains is the on-time departure rate of freight trains; the percentage of trains running within a section at the time specified by the timetable out of all running freight trains is the on-time running rate of freight trains.

    On-Time Rate of Passenger Trains: The situation is the same, only distinguishing between freight trains and passenger trains.

    Transportation Cost: The operating expenses paid for completing the entire passenger and freight transport tasks, which is the cost paid for completing every thousand converted ton-kilometers.

专栏：名词解释

    铁路运输主要指标
    旅行速度：列车在区段内平均每小时走行的公里数。例如：北京天津间距离一百四十公里，列车行驶了四个小时，平均每小时的速度就是三十五公里。其中也包括在各车站为上下旅客、装卸货物等所停留的时间。
    车辆一次中转停留时间：货车被牵引到区段站以后，需要拆散，另行改编或是需要更换机车，但是乘务员仍要继续行驶，而且同这个车站没有装卸关系。这样停留的时间，就叫车辆一次中转停留时间。
    一次货物作业停留时间：车辆在车站上为装货或卸货所消耗的一切时间。
    货车静载重：每辆货车平均装载货物的吨数。
    机车日车公里：每台运用机车平均每天行驶的公里数。
    列车平均总重：每个列车平均牵引的货物重量和货车的车皮重量，但不包括机车自重。
    货物列车正点率：由区段站按照运行图规定的时间开出的列车列数占全部货物列车的比重，就是货物列车始发正点率；按照运行图规定的时间在区段内运行的列车数占全部运行货物列车数的比重，就是货物列车运行正点率。
    旅客列车正点率，情况相同，只是货物列车和旅客列车的分别。
    运输成本：为完全客货运输任务所支付的运营费用，也就是为完成每千个换算吨公里所支付的费用。
