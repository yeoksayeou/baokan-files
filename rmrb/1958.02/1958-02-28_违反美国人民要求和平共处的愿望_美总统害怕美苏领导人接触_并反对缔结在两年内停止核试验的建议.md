Xinhua News Agency, February 27th, reporting from New York via TASS on February 26th: "Life" magazine reported the results of an opinion poll conducted by the Princeton (New Jersey) "Public Opinion Research Institute" among American residents, showing that the American people hope for peaceful coexistence.

The magazine emphasized: "Hardly anyone is worried that we will be bombed by Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles next week or next year." And many Americans are "increasingly uneasy about domestic problems, including youth crime and the economic situation." 73% of the farmers surveyed believe that "improving the situation of farmers" is the primary issue, while "national defense ranks fourth."

The magazine said that this situation shows that the majority of American residents are "almost certain that there is no war threatening us at present."

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th, reporting from Washington: US President Eisenhower reiterated at a press conference on the 25th that the United States has no sincerity in promoting contact between the leaders of the US and Soviet governments.

A reporter asked Eisenhower whether his third letter to Bulganin, in which he mentioned the possibility of Soviet leaders visiting the United States, was an invitation to Bulganin, Khrushchev, and other Soviet leaders. Eisenhower firmly replied, "No." He said that he was not referring to "officials in office" but only "leaders in the world of ideas," otherwise it would become a summit meeting between East and West.

Eisenhower also stated that the United States currently does not intend to stop conducting nuclear weapons tests. He said that Stassen, the recently resigned presidential advisor on disarmament, had recently proposed an agreement with the Soviet Union to cease nuclear weapons testing for two years, but he believed that it was better not to discuss the details of such a proposal at this time. To find an excuse for this obstructionist stance on resolving disarmament issues, Eisenhower insisted that concluding such an agreement was "difficult" because America's allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are in various stages of producing thermonuclear weapons, some of which are in the stage of needing to be produced and tested.

Regarding the economic recession in the United States, Eisenhower admitted that this "recession" would continue for some time. He said that he had never said, as some newspapers pointed out, that there would be a "critical" state in March, that the economy would rapidly improve, or even gradually improve. He also said that although the government is implementing some public works programs, the new projects will not "provide many opportunities" for employment. As for tax cuts, since the US government is asking for increased "funds for doing everything," it "does not hope" to reduce the taxes of the people.

    违反美国人民要求和平共处的愿望
    美总统害怕美苏领导人接触
    并反对缔结在两年内停止核试验的建议
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社纽约26日讯：“生活”杂志报道，普林斯顿市
  （新泽西州）“民意研究所”在美国居民中间进行民意测验的结果表明：美国人民希望和平共处。
    这家杂志强调指出：“差不多没有一个人担心我们在下周或来年会遭到俄国洲际弹道导弹的轰炸。”而许多美国人“对国内问题，包括青年犯罪和经济情况，则日益感到不安。”73％的受测验的农民认为“改善农民状况问题”是首要问题，而“国防问题占第四位”。
    杂志说，这种情况表明：美国大多数居民“差不多都确信目前没有战争威胁着我们”。
    据新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔25日在记者招待会上又一次表明，美国对于促进美苏两国政府领导人之间的接触并无诚意。
    有记者问艾森豪威尔，在他给布尔加宁的第三封信中曾经提到苏联领袖访问美国的可能性，这是不是对布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫和苏联其他领导人的一种邀请。艾森豪威尔在回答时坚决地说：“不是”。他说，他指的不是“担任官职的人员”，而只是“思想界的领袖”，不然就会变成一个东西方最高级会议。
    艾森豪威尔还表示，美国目前不打算停止进行核武器试验。他说，已经辞职的总统裁军顾问史塔生最近提出了关于同苏联缔结在两年内停止试验核武器的协定的建议，但是他认为现在还是不讨论这种建议的细节为好。为了替这种阻挠解决裁军问题的立场找寻借口，艾森豪威尔硬说缔结这样的协定是“有困难”的。因为美国在北大西洋公约组织中的盟国正处在生产热核武器的各种阶段，其中有些正处在需要生产和试验的阶段。
    谈到美国的经济衰退，艾森豪威尔承认，这个“衰退”还要继续一个时期。他说，他从来没有像某些报纸指出的那样曾经说过3月份将有一种“临界”状态，经济将迅速好转，或者甚至逐步好转。他并且说，政府虽然实行一些公共工程计划，但是新的工程并不会对就业“提供很多机会”。至于减税，由于美国政府正在要求增加“做每一件事情的款项”，所以“不希望”减低人民的捐税。
