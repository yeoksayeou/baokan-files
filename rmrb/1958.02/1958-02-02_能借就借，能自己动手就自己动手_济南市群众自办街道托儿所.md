　　Borrow if you can, do it yourself if you can
    Jinan City masses self-run street nurseries
    (Our newspaper Jinan, 1st dispatch) The masses in Jinan City, Shandong Province, are actively running street nursery organizations.
    Jinan City now has thirty-four mass street nurseries, taking care of more than a thousand children. The thirteen newly developed in 1957 were established entirely by relying on the strength of the masses. This saved the state more than 12,000 yuan compared to the previously government-supported, privately-run nurseries. The Baotuquan Street Nursery, in the spirit of spending less money, doing more work, being diligent and frugal, borrowed furniture whenever possible and made it themselves if they could. Many parents also lent tables, planks, benches, etc. that they were not using at home to the nursery, and some even brought children's toys. Repairing houses and installing electric lights were all solved with the help of the masses, thus saving nearly thirty yuan in expenses. Now, this nursery has increased from accommodating only fourteen or fifteen children to forty-five children.
    The Jinan City Women's Federation recently proposed that, in the spirit of diligence and frugality, in addition to running the existing street nursery organizations well, a summary should be made of the various forms of early childhood organizations organized by the masses themselves, such as children's learning stations, to promote and support the masses in running more street nursery organizations.

　　能借就借，能自己动手就自己动手
    济南市群众自办街道托儿所
    本报济南1日电　山东济南市群众积极举办街道托儿组织。
    济南市现已有群众街道托儿所三十四处，收托儿童千余名。1957年新发展的十三处，就是完全依靠群众的力量筹办起来的。这比过去民办公助的托儿所，为国家节约开支一万二千多元。趵突泉街道托儿所，本着少花钱多办事勤俭节约的精神，需要的家具，能借的就借，能自己动手的就自己动手。许多家长还把家里暂时不用的桌子、铺板、凳子等，借给托儿所，有的还送去了儿童玩具。修理房屋，安装电灯都是群众帮助解决的，因而节约了近三十元的开支。现在这个托儿所由只收容十四、五个孩子，增加到四十五个孩子了。
    济南市妇联最近提出：本着勤俭精神，除了办好现有街道托儿组织外，对群众自己组织起来的幼儿学习站等多种形式的幼儿组织进行一次总结，加以推广，支持群众自办更多的街道托儿组织。　（桂芳）
