Publication of the Chinese Translation of "Epitome of Western Masterpieces"

　　Hamerton's "Epitome of World Masterpieces," edited in England, is a work introducing world masterpieces in philosophy, social sciences, and natural sciences. This work has been widely welcomed in Western academic circles for its rich and diverse content and concise and clear language.

　　The "Epitome of Western Masterpieces" (translated by Hé Níng) recently published by China Youth Publishing House is a selected translation from its philosophy and social science sections. This book contains abstracts of thirty-six works by twenty-eight great thinkers from around 400 BC to the end of the 19th century. Although it cannot be said that this book is completely without shortcomings in its selection, the quality of the translation should be considered good, basically achieving "faithfulness" and "expressiveness."

　　In the field of philosophy, this "Epitome of Western Masterpieces" includes translations of works by Greek and Roman philosophers such as Plato's "The Republic" and Aristotle's "Ethics" and "Politics"; by modern philosophers such as Locke's "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding," Hobbes' "Leviathan," Descartes' "Discourse on the Method," Spinoza's "Ethics," Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" and "Critique of Practical Reason," and Hegel's "Philosophy of Religion"; and by philosophers at the beginning of the modern bourgeois philosophy period, such as Comte's "The Course of Positive Philosophy," Schopenhauer's "The World as Will and Representation," Spencer's "First Principles," and Nietzsche's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra."

　　In the social sciences, it includes translations of sociological and economic works from the 16th century to the early modern bourgeoisie, such as More's "Utopia," Machiavelli's "The Prince," Grotius' "On the Law of War and Peace," Rousseau's "The Social Contract," Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations," Malthus' "An Essay on the Principle of Population," and Mill's "Principles of Political Economy."

　　In order to meet the general public's need to understand Western classical masterpieces, the original editor of this book selected works in philosophy that are more focused on socio-political, religious, and ethical aspects, and not necessarily the most important works of famous authors. This approach is originally not reprehensible.

　　However, judging from the original editor's point of view, some works by the 18th-century French materialists La Mettrie, Holbach, Helvetius, and Diderot did not meet the readers' requirements. For example, Holbach's "The System of Nature," Helvetius' "De l'Esprit," Diderot's "Rameau's Nephew," and Feuerbach's "The Essence of Christianity" or "Lectures on the Essence of Religion," a 19th-century German materialist, were not included. Why did the original editor completely ignore these classical masterpieces, without even introducing a single one? Here, one can see their attitude toward selecting "world masterpieces."

　　Because of this, the editorial department of China Youth Publishing House specially asked the translator to refer to the Soviet Encyclopedia and the Concise Dictionary of Philosophy to make a biographical sketch of the authors and an introduction to the works, and discarded the original book's existing introductions to the works. This is completely correct and necessary to help readers correctly understand the content of those works.

　　Despite some shortcomings in this "Epitome of Western Masterpieces," the "Editor's Note" states: "The purpose of compiling and translating this book is to give young readers some general knowledge about ancient Western academic trends and to help comrades who wish to directly read Western academic masterpieces gain an introductory stepping stone." I believe that this point can be achieved.

　　This content-rich "Epitome of Western Masterpieces" is a good reading material for comrades studying philosophy, especially those studying the history of philosophy, and is worth recommending to them. (Méi Chén)

### “西方名著提要”中译本出版

　　“西方名著提要”中译本出版
    英国汉默顿编辑的“世界名著提要”是一部介绍哲学、社会科学和自然科学方面的世界名著的著作。这部著作因内容丰富多采，文字简洁明确，曾在西方学术界中得到比较广泛的欢迎。
    中国青年出版社新近出版的“西方名著提要”（何宁译），就是从它的关于哲学和社会科学部分里面选译而成的。这部书容纳了从纪元前四百年左右到十九世纪末叶的二十八位大思想家的三十六部著作的提要。虽然这部书在选译方面还不能说完全没有缺点，但是在译文质量方面应该说是好的，基本上做到了“信”与“达”的地步。
    这部“西方名著提要”在哲学方面选译有：关于希腊罗马哲学家有柏拉图的“国家篇”，亚里斯多德的“伦理学”，“政治学”等；关于近代哲学家有洛克的“人类理智论”，霍布士的“利维坦”，笛卡尔的“方法论”，斯宾诺莎的“伦理学”，康德的“纯粹理性批判”和“实践理性批判”，黑格尔的“宗教哲学”等；关于现代资产阶级哲学开始阶段的哲学家，有孔德的“实证哲学教程”，叔本华的“意志和表象的世界”，斯宾塞的“第一原理”，尼采的“查拉杜斯特拉如是说”等。
    在社会科学方面选译了从十六世纪开始以至现代资产阶级初期的社会学和经济学的著作：例如莫尔的“乌托邦”，马基雅维利的“霸术”，格老秀斯的“战争与和平的法规”，卢梭的“社会契约论”，亚当斯密的“国富论”，马尔萨斯的“人口论”，密尔的“政治经济学原理”等。
    这部书的原编者为了满足一般人对于西方古典名著了解的需要，在哲学方面所选出的著作比较偏重于社会政治、宗教伦理方面，而不一定是名作者的最主要的著作。这种做法本来是未可厚非的。
    不过就从原著的这个编辑观点来说：关于法国十八世纪唯物论者拉梅特里、荷尔巴哈、蔼尔维修斯和狄德罗的一些著作，并没有能满足读者的要求。如荷尔巴哈的“自然体系”，蔼尔维修斯的“论人”，狄德罗的“拉摩的侄儿”，还有十九世纪德国唯物论者费尔巴哈的“基督教的本质”或“宗教本质讲演录”，都没有被收集进去。何以原编者竟完全忽视了这些古典名著，连一本也没有加以介绍呢？这里正可以看出他们对于选择“世界名著”的态度是怎样的了。
    正因为如此，所以中国青年出版社编辑部特请译者参照苏联大百科全书和简明哲学辞典，作了一个关于作者的传略和作品的介绍，并将原书中已有作品介绍弃之不用。这对于帮助读者正确了解那些作品的内容，是完全正确而必要的。
    尽管这部“西方名著提要”有若干缺点，但是关于“编辑部的话”中所说的：“编译此书目的，是想给青年读者一些关于古代西方学术思潮的普通知识，并帮助那些希望直接阅读西方学术名著的同志们，获得一个入门的阶梯”，这一点，我相信是可以达到的。
    这部内容丰富的“西方名著提要”，对于学习哲学的同志们，特别是学习哲学史的同志们来说，是一部很好的读物，是值得向他们推荐的。　（梅辰）
