    I completely agree with the reports by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now I would like to express some opinions on our national budget.

    The Ever-Increasing National Construction Expenditure Demonstrates the Superiority of the Socialist System

    After listening to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report, I felt very excited, both regarding the execution of the 1957 national budget and the arrangements for the 1958 national budget. The rightists deny that our achievements are primary, including denying that the achievements of our financial work are primary. When our financial and economic situation encountered some temporary and partial difficulties at the end of 1956 and the beginning of 1957, the rightists were even gloating and gesticulating, saying that our economic construction practice was in a crisis stage. Now the vivid facts have made the most powerful refutation to the rightists. As a result of the execution of the 1957 national budget, both income and expenditure exceeded the plan, and income exceeded expenditure. Compared with the end of 1956, the country's commodity and material inventory increased, and the market currency circulation decreased to some extent while ensuring needs. The results we originally expected were all successfully achieved. Isn't this the most significant achievement? In our national budget expenditure, the proportion of national construction expenditure (including economic construction expenditure and cultural and educational construction expenditure) in total expenditure has increased from 59 percent in 1952 to 64.17 percent in 1957. In terms of absolute figures, it has almost doubled. In the 1958 national budget, the proportion and absolute number of national construction expenditures have also increased significantly. Such a proportion and such a growth rate were unimaginable in the era of Kuomintang rule. Taking 1936 as an example, the expenditure on economic construction and culture and education in the national budget of the Kuomintang government at that time only accounted for 16.23 percent of the total expenditure. It must also be pointed out that the national budget of the Kuomintang government was only a formality, and whether the actual execution result could reach such a proportion still needs a big question mark. Similarly, such a proportion and such a growth rate cannot be compared with any capitalist country. Don't these facts most clearly demonstrate the superiority of our socialist system and the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party?

    Socialist Economy is a Planned Economy; the National Budget is a Powerful Weapon for Completing the Plan

    Our country is a socialist country, and our economy is a socialist economy. The theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of various socialist countries have pointed out that the economy of a socialist country must be a planned economy. That is to say, the socialist economy must have unified leadership and unified planning. In capitalist society, the means of production belong to a few capitalists. The capitalists compete with each other for their own or their respective groups' maximum profits. Therefore, there can be no planned economy there, and there can only be anarchy of production. In socialist society, because the public ownership of basic means of production has been realized, the state can bring various departments of the national economy into the orbit of the plan and develop the national economy in a planned way. This is also a manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system. However, it should also be pointed out that under unified leadership and unified planning, the socialist system also maximizes the enthusiasm and creativity of various departments, various localities, and the masses. Under the socialist system, the working masses understand that they are the masters of society, and the construction and progress of society will improve their material and cultural life. The development of the national economy is closely combined with the material interests of the masses. Therefore, hundreds of millions of people can consciously carry out selfless labor. Unified leadership, unified planning, adapting to local conditions, and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, concentration and democracy, are dialectically combined in this way in socialist society, becoming a unity of opposites. This unity of opposites is also clearly manifested in the national budget.

    Our national budget is compiled according to the national economic plan. It is not only a reflection of the national economic plan, but also a powerful weapon for completing the national economic plan and an important means for the state to manage the socialist economy. It is fundamentally different from the situation where the national budget of capitalist countries is dominated by spontaneous economic forces. Our national budget is not only planned but also unified. It is a comprehensive reflection of the finances of various departments and localities. The budgets of all departments and localities are compiled in accordance with the unified policies, laws, regulations, and systems of the state. In old China, warlords were separated and finances were not unified. According to statistics, there were as many as 100 kinds of surcharges on land taxes in Jiangsu Province at that time, more than 70 kinds in Zhejiang Province, and more than 60 kinds in Jiangxi Province. Can this chaotic financial situation be compared with our financial situation today? On the one hand, our national budget has a high degree of unity and planning, and on the other hand, it has a high degree of democracy. The Constitution of our country stipulates that people's congresses at all levels have the right to review and approve local budgets at all levels, while the national budget is reviewed and approved by the National People's Congress. The arrangement of the national budget fully considers giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of various departments, various localities, and the masses under unified leadership and unified planning. After the improvement of the financial management system in 1958, on the one hand, basic construction investment is uniformly distributed by the state, so that the country's key construction can be guaranteed. On the other hand, it clearly delineated the scope of local financial revenue and expenditure, appropriately expanded the local authority and responsibility for managing finances, and increased a part of the local mobile financial resources, which can enable localities to arrange revenue and expenditure more rationally and better give play to the local enthusiasm and creativity in managing finances. Similarly, the authority and responsibility of enterprises in financial management have also been appropriately expanded, and the method of retaining profits for enterprises has been implemented. In 1958, more than 1.09 billion yuan was retained for enterprises to arrange on their own, which also made enterprises more concerned about their income and better give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of enterprises. These measures are vivid embodiments of our country's democratic centralism in financial management.

    The Budget is the People's Budget for Peaceful Construction; It Can Be Completed as Long as We Rely on and Mobilize the Masses

    In the 1958 national budget expenditure, the proportion of economic construction funds and social, cultural, and educational funds increased from 64.17 percent in 1957 to 67.88 percent, while the proportion of national defense expenditures and administrative expenses decreased from 25.63 percent in 1957 to 21.17 percent. This shows that our national budget is a people's budget for peaceful construction. Our national budget is based on the high growth of the economy and the gradual improvement of people's lives. The national budget promotes the development of the national economy, and the development of the national economy further consolidates the foundation of the national budget. The national budget concentrates a part of the funds from the national income, and the distribution and use of this part of the funds by the state further increases the national income, enabling the people's lives to be gradually improved. The budget of capitalist countries is just the opposite. Its budget expenditure is not used for production and construction. It is mainly used to expand armaments, so that a handful of monopoly capitalists can obtain the greatest profits. According to the budget message recently submitted to the US Congress by US President Eisenhower, of the total US budget expenditure of 73.9 billion US dollars in 1958-1959, the broadly defined national defense expenditure, including national security guarantee expenses and international affairs expenses, reached 47.1 billion US dollars, accounting for 64 percent of the total expenditure. This reactionary budget of US aggression and war preparation will inevitably lead to a sharp increase in the tax burden of the US working people and a continued rise in the prices of consumer goods, and therefore will inevitably lead to a gradual decline in the living standards of the vast number of working people. Although the national budget of the United States is fundamentally incomparable with our national budget, the two different social systems and the two different national budgets are still very clearly seen here.

    Because our national budget is the people's budget for peaceful construction, the human factor and the political factor will inevitably play a great role in financial work, just as in all other economic work. In our country, the people have become the masters of the country. The people understand that the successful realization of the national budget is closely related to their own vital interests. When hundreds of millions of people consciously struggle for a goal, they will generate unparalleled power. From the financial work in recent years, we can cite some examples. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in 1952, the national budget achieved more income than expenditure and had a surplus. After the state put forward the call for increasing production and practicing economy in 1953, it timely reversed the tense situation in financial revenue and expenditure and cash scheduling that had appeared at that time. The increase production and practice economy campaign and the rectification campaign in 1957 made the execution of the national budget achieve encouraging results. Therefore, as long as we rely on the masses and give play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses, we have no insurmountable difficulties.

    The arrangement of the 1958 national budget is basically in line with the current political and economic situation, and the various revenue and expenditure figures in the budget are also positive and prudent. In order to further tap potential and increase the funds that can be supplied, we in the budget committee believe that revenue can be increased by more than 100 million yuan. In this way, plus a part of the undistributed funds retained in other economic construction expenditures and the funds in the national general reserve fund that can be invested in construction in the future, our country's national budget reserve funds are quite sufficient. I personally consider that if there are no major problems with the annual harvest in August and September this year, and the conditions in all aspects permit, it is entirely possible for us to increase basic construction investment by several hundred million yuan.

    The vigorous production and construction upsurge in 1958 has been launched magnificently, and the people of the whole country are working selflessly on various production fronts with full confidence. This situation provides extremely favorable conditions for the smooth realization of the 1958 national budget. As long as we all, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, go all out and strive for the upstream, the successful and overfulfilled completion of the 1958 national budget can be expected.

### 我们国家预算的优越性  王绍鏊代表的发言

    我们国家预算的优越性
    王绍鏊代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告。现在我想对我们的国家预算发表一些意见。
    国家建设的支出与年俱增  说明社会主义制度的优越性
    听了李先念副总理的报告，不论就一九五七年国家预算的执行情况来说或者就一九五八年国家预算的安排情况来说，都使我感到非常兴奋。右派分子否认我们的成绩是主要的，包括否认我们的财政工作的成绩是主要的在内。当一九五六年底和一九五七年初我国财政经济方面遇到一些暂时的局部的困难的时候，右派分子更是幸灾乐祸，并且指手划脚地说什么我国经济建设实践正处在危机阶段中，现在鲜明的事实已经对右派分子做了最有力的驳斥。一九五七年国家预算执行的结果，收入和支出都超过了计划，而且收入多于支出，同一九五六年年底比较，国家的商品物资库存增加了，市场货币流通量在保证需要的条件下有了一部分减少，我们原来预期的结果，都圆满地实现了。难道这不是最显著的成绩吗？在我们的国家预算支出中，国家建设支出（包括经济建设支出和文化教育建设支出）占总支出的比重，已经从一九五二年的百分之五十九增加到一九五七年的百分之六十四点一七，就绝对数字来说，则差不多增长了一倍。在一九五八年国家预算中，国家建设支出所占的比重和绝对数又有显著的增长。这样的比重和这样的增长速度，在国民党统治时代是不可想像的。拿一九三六年来说，当时国民党政府的国家预算中，经济建设和文化教育方面的支出只占总支出的百分之十六点二三，而且还必须指出，国民党政府的国家预算只是一个形式，其实际执行的结果是否能达到这样的比重，还需要画一个大大的问号。同样，这样的比重和这样的增长速度也不是任何一个资本主义国家所能够比拟的。这些事实，不是最清楚地说明了我们社会主义制度的优越性和共产党领导的英明正确吗？
    社会主义经济是有计划的经济  国家预算是完成计划的有力武器
    我们的国家是社会主义的国家，我们的经济是社会主义的经济。马克思列宁主义的理论和各个社会主义国家的实践都指明：社会主义国家的经济必须是有计划的经济。这也就是说，社会主义经济必须要有统一领导和统一计划。在资本主义社会里，生产资料属于少数资本家所有，资本家们为着各自的或者各自集团的最大利润而彼此竞争着，因此，那里不可能有什么计划经济，那里只能是生产的无政府状态。在社会主义社会里，由于实现了基本生产资料的公有制，所以国家就有可能把国民经济各部门纳入计划的轨道，有计划地发展国民经济。这也就是社会主义制度的优越性的表现。但是，还应该指出，在统一领导和统一计划下，社会主义制度又最大限度地发挥了各部门、各地方和群众的积极性和创造性。在社会主义制度下，劳动群众了解了自己是社会的主人，社会的建设和进步，就会使自己的物质生活和文化生活获得改善，国民经济的发展同群众的物质利益密切地结合在一起，因此，千百万群众就能够自觉地进行忘我的劳动。统一领导、统一计划同因地制宜、发挥群众的积极性和创造性，集中和民主，在社会主义社会里就是这样辩证地结合起来，成为对立的统一。这种对立的统一，在国家预算方面，也同样明显地表现出来。
    我们的国家预算是根据国民经济计划来编制的，它不仅是国民经济计划的反映，而且是完成国民经济计划的有力武器，是国家管理社会主义经济的重要手段。它同资本主义国家预算受经济自发势力支配的情况是有根本不同的。我们的国家预算不仅有计划性，而且有统一性。它是各部门、各地方财政的综合反映，所有各部门、各地方的预算又都是根据国家统一的政策法令和制度规章来编制的。在旧中国，军阀割据，财政不统一，据统计当时江苏省田赋附征的名目有一百种之多，浙江省有七十多种，江西省有六十多种，这种财政混乱的局面难道能够同我们今天的财政情况同日而语吗？我们的国家预算一方面有高度的统一性和计划性，另一方面又有高度的民主性。我们国家的宪法规定，各级人民代表大会有权审查批准各级地方预算，而国家预算则由全国人民代表大会审查批准。国家预算的安排，是在统一领导和统一计划下充分考虑到发挥各部门、各地方和群众的积极性和创造性。一九五八年改进财政管理体制以后，一方面基本建设投资由国家统一分配，使国家的重点建设能够得到保证，另一方面又明确划定了地方财政收支范围，适当扩大了地方管理财政的权限和责任，增加了地方一部分机动财力，这就能使地方更加合理地安排收支、更好地发挥地方管理财政的积极性和创造性。同样，在企业方面也适当地扩大了企业在财务管理上的权限和责任，实行了企业利润留成的办法，一九五八年留给企业自行安排的资金就达十亿九千多万元，这也就使企业更加关心自己的收入，更好地发挥企业的积极性和创造性。这些措施，就是我国的民主集中制度在财政管理方面的生动的体现。
    预算是人民的和平建设的预算  只要依靠和发动群众就能完成
    一九五八年国家预算支出中，经济建设费和社会文教费所占的比重，由一九五七年的百分之六十四点一七增加到百分之六十七点八八，而国防费和行政费所占的比重则由一九五七年的百分之二十五点六三降到百分之二十一点一七。这说明我们的国家预算是人民的和平建设的预算。我们的国家预算是建立在经济高涨和人民生活逐步改善的基础之上的。国家预算促进了国民经济的发展，国民经济的发展又进一步巩固了国家预算的基础。国家预算从国民收入中集中了一部分资金，而通过国家对这一部分资金的分配使用又进一步增加了国民收入，使人民生活获得逐步的改善。资本主义国家的预算则恰恰相反，它的预算支出并不是用于生产建设，它主要是用来扩充军备，使一小撮垄断资本家获得最大的利润。根据美国总统艾森豪威尔最近向美国国会提出的预算咨文，美国一九五八至一九五九年度预算总支出七百三十九亿美元中，国家安全保障费和国际事务费加在一起的广义的国防费即达四百七十一亿美元，占总支出的百分之六十四。美国这种侵略备战的反动的预算，必然会使美国劳动人民的税收负担急剧增加和消费品价格继续上涨，因而也就必然会使广大劳动人民的生活水平日益下降。虽然美国的国家预算同我们的国家预算是有根本的不可比的地方，但在这里，两种不同社会制度和两种不同的国家预算，仍然是看得非常清楚的。
    由于我们的国家预算是人民的和平建设的预算，因此，人的因素，政治的因素，在财政工作中也像在其他一切经济工作中一样，必然发生伟大的作用。在我们国家里，人民已经做了国家的主人，人民了解国家预算的圆满实现是同自己的切身利益息息相关的，当千百万人民群众自觉地为一个目标而奋斗时，他们就会产生无比巨大的力量。从近几年的财政工作中，我们可以举出一些例子来。一九五二年进行“三反”“五反”以后，国家预算就做到了收多于支而有结余。一九五三年国家提出增产节约的号召后，就及时地扭转了当时一度出现的财政收支和现金调度的紧张局面。一九五七年的增产节约运动和整风运动，又使国家预算的执行获得了令人鼓舞的成绩。因此，只要我们依靠群众，发挥群众的创造性和积极性，我们是没有不可克服的困难的。
    一九五八年国家预算的安排，是基本上符合当前的政治、经济的形势的，预算中的各项收支数字也都是积极和稳妥的。为了更进一步挖掘潜力，增加可能供应的资金，我们在预算委员会讨论时认为收入方面还可以再增加一亿多元，这样，加上保留在其他经建支出中的一部分待分配经费和国家总预备费中将来可以投到建设方面去的资金，我们国家预算的后备资金是相当充足的。我个人考虑，在今年预算执行到八、九月，如果年景没有什么大问题，各方面的条件又许可时，我们再增加若干亿元的基本建设投资是完全可以做到的。
    一九五八年轰轰烈烈的生产建设高潮已经波澜壮阔地开展起来了，全国人民正满怀信心地在各个生产战线上进行忘我的劳动，这种形势为一九五八年国家预算的顺利实现提供了极为有利的条件。只要我们大家在中国共产党的领导下鼓足干劲，力争上游，一九五八年国家预算圆满地和超额地完成是可以拭目以待的。
