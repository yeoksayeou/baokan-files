The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
Report on Cadres at All Levels Cultivating Experimental Plots

To the Central Committee and all local and county Party committees:

Since the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the ideological style of rural cadres in our province has undergone significant changes. This transformation is closely related to the decentralization of cadres, their participation in production and leadership of production, especially the personal involvement of leading cadres at all levels in cultivating experimental plots. Cadres cultivating experimental plots is a very meaningful creation, which plays a decisive role in implementing the Party's mass line work method and realizing the Party's specific leadership over agricultural production. Recently, this method has been widely promoted in various counties of our province, and many counties have achieved remarkable results in this regard, beginning to fundamentally change the face of rural work. Taking Hong'an County as an example: out of a total of 1,470 cadres at the county, district, township, and commune levels, 1,151 are personally involved in cultivating experimental plots. Among them are 14 county committee members, 17 district committee secretaries (guidance group leaders), 45 township branch secretaries, and 632 commune directors, cultivating a total of 646 mu of experimental rice paddies, 476 mu of experimental peanut fields, as well as experimental plots for cotton, sweet potatoes, and other crops. The yields of these experimental plots are all higher than those of ordinary commune fields. Xiao Linshan, a county committee member and deputy county head, cultivated two mu of experimental rice paddies, achieving a record of over 1,000 jin of rice per mu. Wang Zuozhong, the secretary of the Qili District Committee, achieved a record of 1,190 jin of peanuts per mu in his one mu peanut experimental plot. In addition, there were also bumper harvest records of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. Under the promotion and influence of the experimental plots, large-scale bumper harvests were achieved. The county had 313 communes with grain yields of over 1,000 jin per mu, 128 communes with peanut yields of over 800 jin per mu, and 21 communes with ginned cotton yields of over 100 jin per mu. All fifteen kinds of crops in the county had bumper harvests, and all 732 communes in the county increased production. The average grain yield of the county reached 808 jin per mu, achieving the target set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule. According to the report of the Hong'an County Committee, the process of leading cadres at all levels in Hong'an County personally engaging in experimental plots is as follows:

    "Four-More" and "Three-Willing, Three-Unwilling"

    Before the winter of 1956, the county-level organs were rife with the sayings of "Four-More" and "Three-Willing, Three-Unwilling." The so-called "Four-More" meant "more riding bicycles, more playing basketball, more wearing overcoats, and more eating in the cafeteria." The so-called "Three-Willing, Three-Unwilling" meant "willing to sit in the office holding meetings, unwilling to go to the countryside to lead production; willing to go to advanced communes, unwilling to go to backward communes; willing to deal with township and commune cadres, unwilling to do in-depth mass work." Out of the eighteen county committee members, only three, at most seven, went to the countryside regularly. Some leading cadres in county-level organs lacked the perspective of serving the rural areas and farmers, going to work on time and taking vacations as usual, which caused a lot of trouble and inconvenience to the farmers, who were very dissatisfied. For example, the township head of Liangdao Township waited outside the county post and telecommunications bureau for an hour or two to negotiate the installation of a telephone line, but no one paid attention to him, saying that they "didn't have time." When they "had time," they said, "It's off work!" The township head was very annoyed. Therefore, later, when cadres from the post office went to Liangdao Township to understand relevant business matters, he also said, "I don't have time." When the post office cadres waited for a while and went to him again, he said, "I'm off work!" This dramatic act of revenge by the township head of Liangdao Township reflected the farmers' dissatisfaction with the bureaucratic style of the county-level organs. Some leading cadres in county-level organs were unwilling to go to the countryside, and some even if they were "forced" to go to the countryside, were "in the countryside in body, but in the city in mind." For example, Zhang Fu, the director of the taxation bureau, after only three days in the countryside, said to the township cadres, "I want to go back to the city to get a haircut." The township cadres said, "We'll find you a good barber." He said, "I want to go back to the city to take a bath." The township cadres said, "We'll find you a good bathtub." He said, "I want to go back to the city to change my clothes."… And so, he slipped away on his bicycle. Because the leaders above did not go deep and were not specific, the cadres below followed suit. From top to bottom, everyone was accustomed to solving problems by "holding meetings." The phenomenon of "too many meetings" reappeared. Chen Kaihe, the branch secretary of Yonghe Township, held meetings for twenty-eight days in a month, which affected the labor attendance rate of that township, which only reached 60%. Many cadres were not settled in rural work, believing that there was "no future" in rural work, and therefore could not go deep into their work. Zhang Hanxing, a worker in Jinniu District, was lazy, liked to eat, dress well, have fun, and sleep well. He worked in Nantai Township for nine months and lived in fourteen communes, none of which welcomed him. Members of the Qiancheng Commune wrote a ditty about him: "Zhang Hanxing, no good, sleeps all day, keeps people up all night." Many cooperatives were left unattended. The Alliance No. 2 Commune of Tongbai Township had been reducing production for years, and the cadre stationed in the commune, Deputy District Head Han Wei, was a so-called "name-only commune director." In 1956, the first year of cooperation, everyone lacked experience in running a commune, which was a fact. However, the fact that the leadership did not go deep and were not specific, that some cadres were not settled in rural work and were not enthusiastic about running the commune, was also a fact. Therefore, in that year, among all the cooperatives in the county, communes that reduced production accounted for 10.7%, and communes with very little increase in production (5%-10%) accounted for 30%.

    Decentralizing Cadres, Commending Models

    Under the education and encouragement of the spirit of hard struggle advocated by the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the county committee took a series of powerful measures to improve leadership and improve work. The main measures were to streamline the upper levels and decentralize cadres. Fifteen stronger district committee cadres were sent to serve as general branch secretaries of fifteen backward townships, and 195 stronger district and township cadres were sent to serve as leading cadres of 176 backward communes, and the method of decentralizing cadres at all levels and fixing them in one commune to contract for work and production was adopted. One hundred and seventy-six outstanding organ cadres and eighty-seven township cadres were transferred to strengthen the leadership of the communes, and another 1,240 commune cadres were transferred to strengthen the leadership of the production teams. All cadres decentralized to townships, communes, and teams were required to be responsible to the end. In view of the fact that some cadres were "decentralized in body, but not in mind," a discussion of the model deeds of advanced figures was launched among all cadres. The model deeds of these advanced figures, such as Li Haiqing, the township general branch secretary who requested to be decentralized and actively run the commune in his hometown; Jiang Tengrong, the commune director who was selfless and dedicated to the commune; Xin Shilong, the commune director who boldly innovated and was not afraid of difficulties; Wang Zuntang, the township head who ran the commune diligently and transformed the backward commune into an advanced commune; Ye Dunwen, the organ decentralized cadre who was diligent and in-depth, united and helped the township cadres; Xu Dama, a model martyr's family member, etc., played a profound educational role for the majority of cadres. For example, Chen Hongguo, a decentralized cadre who was quite resistant to "decentralization" originally, after participating in this discussion, examined his own erroneous thoughts and resolved to work in the Shili Township Central Commune for the rest of his life. After the decentralization of cadres and the launch of this discussion, not only were all communes responsible, but also greatly stimulated the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of cadres in running cooperatives. Huang Chengzhong, the deputy branch secretary of Zhan Dian Township, used to run around and leave early and return late. Since being stationed in the commune, he had not returned home once in three months. The commune members said that he "was the bodyguard of his wife last year, and a servant of the people this year."

    Participating in Production, Leading Production

    While decentralizing cadres, the county committee emphasized that cadres should participate in production and lead production. Among the eighteen members of the county committee, fourteen often went to the countryside. Cadres from county-level organs went to the countryside in rotation for short-term decentralization, and even the county committee office was moved to a key township. However, some comrades still could not go deep into their work even after going to the countryside. Wang Shuchang, the guidance group leader of Gaoqiao District, and Deng Kaizhi, the branch secretary of the farm township, who had applied to be transferred away from the countryside three times, were "inspecting production" on the edge of the field wearing shoes and socks. A commune member shouted loudly at them, "Damn it, swaying around like a young master, don't step on our field ridges!" Wang Shuchang asked, "Who are you cursing?" The commune member said, "I'm cursing you!" Wang Shuchang reported this situation to Zhang Jingtian, the deputy secretary of the county committee who was working in the countryside at the time. Zhang Jingtian said, "The cursing is right! This is because we have not participated in production and led production!" Zhang Jingtian told the cadres in this district about this matter and called on the cadres in this district to participate in production and lead production. He himself took the lead in spending more than one yuan to buy a hoe. Under his influence, all cadres in the district bought a hoe. Soon, among the 10,925 rural cadres in the county, 97% had their own hoes, sickles, and labor notebooks, and participated in production. Pan Zhi, the head of the organization department of the county committee, helped the Wanxing Commune in Bali Township plow the fields and deliver manure during the day, and helped the commune with contracting work and production at night. The commune members praised him as "both civil and military." After the majority of cadres participated in production, their relationship with the peasant masses became closer, which promoted production at that time. However, it also brought new problems: when cadres participated in the commune's production, they were often assigned to do light work with women and children, making it difficult to understand the situation and discover problems. Some cadres, although they took on the main labor, also neglected to lead production due to participating in production all day long, and could not systematically summarize experience and guide the overall situation because they did not understand the overall situation. For example, Xiong Chuanyu, the deputy township head of Zhangdian Township, worked in the Xingguang Commune for three days, but could not say anything about the situation at the meeting. He said painfully: "What kind of mess is this? I'm so tired that my back aches, and I haven't done a good job!" For almost half a month, many cadres had the same troubles as Xiong Chuanyu. It seems that it is difficult to achieve the purpose of leading production just by participating in production with a hoe in one's hand. What to do?

    Cultivating Experimental Plots, Realizing Specific Leadership

    Cheng Peng, the first secretary of the county committee, and Ku Chongde, the minister of rural work, explored an experience in the Jiansu Commune of Xinghua Township, a key township of the county committee, that is, using the method of leading cadres personally cultivating experimental plots can better achieve participation in production and leadership of production.

    In March 1957, when it was time to sow peanuts, Cheng Peng and Zhu Yihong, the head of the district technical station, together selected one mu of land in the Wufenggang production team of the Jiansu Commune as an experimental peanut field, and absorbed Qin Laowu, the technician of this production team, and Qin Biquan, a well-off middle peasant with experience in peanut production, to participate in the experimental field work. Cheng Peng relied on these technical cadres and experienced peasants to personally experiment, carefully study, and set a vivid example on this experimental field. For example, when sowing peanuts, the local custom was not to apply base fertilizer, saying "peanuts don't need fertilizer." Cheng Peng asked Qin Biquan, "What should we do?" Qin said that he used to apply fertilizer according to the field conditions, not only applying liquid manure, but also grass ash. Cheng Peng asked Zhu Yihong, "Is this right?" Zhu Yihong said that it was right, and that not only nitrogen fertilizer but also phosphate fertilizer was needed. After discussion, it was decided to apply base fertilizer. The local custom was to plant only one or two seeds. Qin Biquan said that he had planted three seeds, which increased production. The technical cadres also advocated three seeds. After discussion, it was decided to plant three seeds. The local custom was not to plant peanuts densely. Cheng Peng, Zhu Yihong, Qin Biquan, Qin Laowu, and others discussed that dense planting of 7×8 inches could be implemented. After sowing in the manner described above, the peanut seedlings grew very well.

    For example, when weeding peanuts, the local custom was to weed only one or two rows of grass. Cheng Peng visited experienced peasants, who said three ditties that summarized the experience of weeding peanuts, that is, "the first weeding is shallow, the second weeding is deep, and the third and fourth weeding are like embroidery." And said that when weeding the second time, it should be combined with earthing up the base. After discussion, it was decided to do so, and the peanut seedlings grew better and better.

    For example, when fighting drought, some people said, "Since ancient times, peanut seedlings that have suffered from drought cannot be watered, watering will cause them to wither and die." Cheng Peng and his assistants studied and concluded that peanut seedlings that have suffered from drought can also be watered. The method is to water in the morning and evening, which will not cause them to "wither and die." After discussion, it was decided to do so, and the drought was overcome.

    With these vivid examples, on-site meetings were held for visits, comparisons, debates, and summaries. Cheng Peng relied on this experimental field in which he personally participated in the entire process from sowing to harvesting, and realized specific leadership over the county's peanut production. Other county committee members and district, township, and commune leading cadres also realized specific leadership over production through experimental plots.

    The Key to Combining Leaders and the Masses

    The method of leading cadres at all levels personally cultivating experimental plots is the most powerful method of persuasion and demonstration. The fundamental characteristic of this method is the combination of leading cadres, technicians, and the peasant masses. It is of great benefit to the leading cadres, technicians, and the peasant masses themselves. For leading cadres, by cultivating experimental plots, they found the key to combining leaders and the masses, found the weapon to break conservative ideas, promote advanced experience, implement point-to-area combination, and opened the "stuffy gourd" of how to achieve comprehensive, in-depth, and specific leadership over agricultural production. They could promptly understand the situation, discover problems, listen to the voices of the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, effectively avoid or reduce subjectivism and commandism in their work, and better implement the mass line work method. For technical cadres, they received the support of leaders and the masses, improved their enthusiasm for studying technology, learned the experience of mass movements from leading cadres, and learned vivid production experience from the peasant masses. They improved not only their political and ideological level, but also their technical and business level. For the peasant masses, the most practical benefit was increased production, increased income, and improved living standards, thereby further promoting the enthusiasm and creativity of collective labor. The benefits mentioned above are the basis for the combination of leading cadres, technicians, and the peasant masses. With this basis, the method of experimental plots can be further consolidated and improved. Now experimental plots have become widespread in every commune and production team, and a large number of bumper harvest fields have emerged.

    Training a Brand New Technical Team

    The method of leading cadres at all levels personally engaging in experimental plots is an effective method for training a brand new technical team. Among the 766 county, district, and township cadres in Hong'an County (including 122 intellectual cadres), the proportion of cadres who learned to plow fields, harrow fields, prevent and control pests, select seeds, mix seeds, grasp agricultural seasons, transplant seedlings, and weed increased from 18% in 1956 to 66.2% in 1957. The majority of leading cadres at all levels have learned basic production techniques. This is not only of decisive significance for strengthening specific leadership of production, but also of decisive significance for cultivating a brand new technical team. Leading cadres at all levels personally cultivate experimental plots, learn lessons in the process of doing so, improve their awareness, change their style, increase their talents, and further gain the love and support of the masses. Zhang Hanxing, who used to be unpopular everywhere and ridiculed by commune members as "no good," changed the commune members' perception of him after personally engaging in experimental plots. The commune members said, "We would be happy for Comrade Zhang to work in our commune for the rest of his life." Gong Quan'an, an intellectual who used to be unsettled in rural work and ridiculed by commune members as a "foreign sweet potato," said with emotion after cultivating experimental plots and receiving praise from the masses: "Left home to enter school, left school to enter the office, left the office to enter the commune, but was ignorant of production. Cultivating experimental plots has given me an entry into production." Wang Shuchang, the guidance group leader who used to be cursed on the edge of the field when inspecting production and ridiculed by commune members as an "inspector," is now called a "technician" by the masses. Cadres who have personally engaged in experimental plots have such an experience: they are concretely familiar with the production process of crops from beginning to end, have learned a lot of extremely useful production knowledge, and feel interested, energetic, and confident in leading agricultural production. Their feelings for the hardworking and brave peasant masses have become deeper, and they have also developed feelings for everything in the countryside, especially for the growth of crops. Ruan Guansheng, the guidance group leader of Bali Township, after attending an emergency meeting on drought resistance in the county, returned to his commune after traveling seventy miles, even though it was already afternoon. He rushed to the fields to check the crops without even entering his house. Without moonlight, without starlight, and without a flashlight, he lay down on the edge of the field and felt for water in the field, afraid that the rice seedlings in the field would die of drought. The majority of cadres in Hong'an County have transformed from "being in the countryside in body, but in the city in mind" to "being in the city in body, but in the countryside in mind" and "being in the commune in body, but in the field in mind." Of course, these cadres who have developed feelings for the peasants, the land, the crops, and everything in the countryside are now not only very settled in rural work, but also have a growing enthusiasm for building a new socialist countryside. After discussing with the masses, they confidently formulated the 1958 production plan, requiring that the yield per mu of grain and peanuts in the county reach 900 jin in 1958, striving to reach 1,000 jin, and the yield per mu of cotton reach 100 jin; requiring that the total grain output of the county increase by more than 20% compared with 1957, the total peanut output increase by more than 50% compared with 1957, and the total cotton output increase by more than 50% compared with 1957.

    This is the process of leading cadres at all levels in Hong'an County personally engaging in experimental plots. The situation in Macheng, Xiaogan, and other counties is basically the same. The Hong'an County Committee has already conducted a summary of this issue. The provincial committee requires local committees and county committees to conduct a check and summary on this issue like the Hong'an County Committee, and requires them to learn from the Hong'an County Committee's experience in changing leadership methods, transforming cadre style, sending cadres to strengthen the leadership of backward townships, backward communes, and backward teams, striving for increased production in every commune, and bumper harvests in various crops, especially to carry on the method of leading cadres personally cultivating experimental plots to the end. In short, leaders should take the lead, innovation should be tested first. Enthusiasm plus methods, leaping forward is bound to be realized.

    Please instruct the central government whether the above report is appropriate.

### 中国共产党湖北省委员会  关于各级干部种试验田的报告

专栏：

    中国共产党湖北省委员会
    关于各级干部种试验田的报告中央并各地、县委：
    从党的八届二中全会以后，我省农村干部的思想作风有了显著的转变。这个转变，和干部下放、干部参加生产领导生产，特别是各级领导干部亲自动手种试验田有密切的关系。干部种试验田，这是一个很有意义的创造，这对于贯彻执行党的群众路线的工作方法，实现党对农业生产的具体领导，起着决定的作用。最近我省各县已经普遍地推行了这个办法，许多县在这方面有了显著的成效，开始从根本上改变着农村工作的面貌。以红安县为例：该县共有县、区、乡、社四级干部一千四百七十名，亲自动手搞试验田的有一千一百五十一名。其中有县委委员十四名，区委书记（指导组长）十七名，乡支部书记四十五名，社主任六百三十二名，共种了水稻试验田六百四十六亩，花生试验地四百七十六亩，还有棉花、红苕等作物的试验地。这些试验田的产量，都高于合作社一般田地的产量。县委委员、副县长萧林山培育的两亩水稻试验田，获得了亩产水稻千斤的丰收纪录。七里区区委书记王作中的一亩花生试验地获得亩产一千一百九十斤的纪录。此外，还有皮棉亩产一百斤，红苕亩产一万斤的丰产纪录。在试验田的推动和影响之下，实现了大面积丰产。全县有三百一十三个粮食亩产一千斤的社，一百二十八个花生亩产八百斤的社，二十一个皮棉亩产一百斤的社。全县十五种农作物样样丰收，全县七百三十二个合作社，社社增产。全县粮食平均亩产八百零八斤，提前十年达到了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的指标。据红安县委报告，红安县各级领导干部亲自动手搞试验田的经过情形是这样：
    “四多”和“三愿三不愿”
    1956年冬季以前，在县级机关里，流传着“四多”、“三愿三不愿”的说法。所谓“四多”，就是“骑自行车的多，打篮球的多，穿大衣的多，吃食堂的多”。所谓“三愿三不愿”就是“愿坐在屋里开会办公，不愿下乡领导生产；愿到先进社，不愿到落后社；愿和乡、社干部打交道，不愿做深入的群众工作。”县委委员十八人，经常下乡的只有三人，至多不过七人。有些县级机关的领导干部，缺乏面向农村为农民服务的观点，按时上班，照例休假，给农民增加了很多麻烦和不便，农民群众很不满意。例如两道乡乡长为了到县邮电局交涉架设电话线的问题，在外边等了个把钟头，无人理会，说是“没有时间”，等到“有时间”，又说，“下班了”，乡长很是恼火。所以，在以后，邮局干部到两道乡去找他了解有关业务情况的时候，他也说，“没有时间”。邮局干部等了一会又找他，他也说，“我下班了！”两道乡乡长的这种戏剧性的报复行为，反映了农民对于县级机关的官僚主义作风的不满情绪。有些县级机关的领导干部不愿下乡，有的甚至即使“被迫”下乡，也是“人在乡下，心在城里”。例如税务局局长张福下乡才三天，就向乡干部说，“我要回到城里去剃头。”乡干部说，“我们给你找个好剃头师傅。”他说，“我要回到城里去洗澡。”乡干部说，“我们给你找个好洗澡盆。”他说，“我要回到城里去换衣服。”……就这样，骑着自行车溜回去了。由于上面领导的不深入，不具体，下面干部也照样学。从上到下，都习惯于用“开会”的办法解决问题。“会议多”的现象又出现了。永何乡支部书记陈开和一个月开了二十八天的会，影响得那个乡的劳动出勤率只达到60％。许多干部不安心农村工作，认为在农村工作“没有前途”，因而在工作中深入不下去。金牛区的工作员张汉兴，工作消极，好吃、好穿、好玩、好睡，在南台乡工作九个月，住了十四个社，社社都不欢迎他。前程社社员给他编了一首顺口溜：“张汉兴，不成人，白天光睡觉，夜晚熬死人。”许多合作社无人过问。桐柏乡联盟二社连年减产，该社驻社干部副区长韩维，就是一个所谓“挂名办社”的人。1956年这一年，是合作化的第一年，大家都缺乏办社经验，这是事实。但是，领导的不深入，不具体，一部分干部不安心农村工作，不热心办社，也是事实。因此，这一年，全县的合作社当中，减产社占10.7％，增产很少（5％—10％）的社占30％。
    下放干部，表扬模范
    在党的八届二中全会提倡艰苦奋斗的精神的教育和鼓舞之下，县委采取了一系列的有力的措施，改善领导，改进工作。主要的措施是精简上层，下放干部。派了十五个较强的区委干部，担任了十五个落后乡的总支书记，派了一百九十五个较强的区乡干部，担任了一百七十六个落后社的领导干部，并且采取了层层下放，长期固定在一个社里包工包产的办法。抽调了一百七十六名优秀的机关干部和八十七名乡干部，加强社的领导，又抽调了一千二百四十名社干部加强生产队的领导。对于所有下放到乡、社、队的干部，提出了长期负责到底的要求。鉴于有些干部是“人下放了，思想还没有下放”的情况，在全体干部中发动了一次对于先进人物模范事迹的讨论。这些先进人物如要求下放，回乡积极办社的乡总支书记黎海清；大公无私，舍己为社的社主任江藤荣；大胆革新，不怕困难的社主任辛时龙；艰苦办社，变落后社为先进社的乡长汪遵汤；艰苦深入，团结帮助乡干部的机关下放干部叶敦文；模范烈士家属徐大妈等同志的模范事迹，对于广大干部，起了深刻的教育作用。例如原来对于“下放”颇有抵触的下放干部陈洪国在参加了这次讨论之后，检讨了自己的错误思想，决心在十里乡中心社干一辈子。经过干部下放和开展了这次讨论之后，不仅社社有人负责，而且大大地激发了干部办合作社的积极性和责任感。占店乡支部副书记黄成中过去东跑西走，早出晚归。自从固定驻社以后，三个月没有回家一次。社员说他“去年当老婆的卫士，今年做了人民的勤务员”。
    参加生产，领导生产
    在干部下放的同时，县委强调了干部参加生产，领导生产，县委十八个委员中，经常下乡的十四人，县级机关干部，轮流下乡，短期下放，县委办公室也搬到重点乡去了。但是，有些同志虽然下了乡，工作还是深入不下去。曾经三次申请调离农村的高桥区指导组长王树昌和农场乡支部书记邓开志，穿着鞋袜，在田岸上“检查生产”，一个社员对他俩大声叫骂：“娘卖瘟的，摇摇摆摆，像个相公（少爷），莫把我们的田埂子踩坍了！”王树昌问：“你骂谁？”那个社员说，“我骂你！”王树昌把这个情况向当时在乡下工作的县委副书记张景田同志反映。张景田同志说，“骂的对！这是因为我们没有参加生产领导生产！”张景田同志向这个区的干部讲了这件事，号召这个区的干部参加生产，领导生产，他本人带头花了一块多钱买了一把锄头。在他的影响下，全区干部每人都买了一把锄头。不久，全县农村干部一万零九百二十五人中，有97％的人自备了锄头、镰刀和劳动手册，参加了生产。县委组织部长潘知在八里乡万兴社白天帮助社里犁田、送粪，夜里帮助社里搞包工包产。社员夸奖他是“文武双全”。广大干部参加生产之后，和农民群众的关系更加密切了，对于当时生产起了推动作用。但是，也带来了新的问题：干部在参加社的生产的时候，往往被分派到和妇女、小孩在一块干些轻活，不容易了解情况，发现问题。有的干部虽然担任了主要劳动，也是由于成天参加生产，忽视了领导生产，不了解全面情况，就很难系统地总结经验，指导全面。例如张店乡副乡长熊传毓在星光社干了三天农活，开会时，一点情况也谈不出来。他很苦恼地说：“这是搞的么名堂，累的腰酸背胀，工作还没有做好！”差不多有半个月的时间，许多干部都有着熊传毓的那种苦恼。看来光是一个人一把锄头，参加生产，还很难达到领导生产的目的。怎么办呢？
    种了试验田，实现了具体领导
    县委第一书记程鹏和农村工作部长库崇德在县委重点乡杏花乡建苏社摸索到了一条经验，这就是用领导干部亲自动手种试验田的办法，可以更好地做到参加生产、领导生产。
    1957年3月间，正是花生播种的时候，程鹏和区技术站长祝翼宏一块在建苏社五峰岗生产队选择了一亩地作为花生试验地，吸收了这个生产队的技术员秦老五和对于花生生产有经验的富裕中农秦必权参加了试验地工作。程鹏依靠这些技术干部和有经验的农民，在这块试验地上亲自试验，认真研究，做出了活的榜样。例如在花生播种的时候，当地的习惯是不上底肥，说什么“花生不要肥”。程鹏问秦必权“怎么办？”秦说，他过去是看田施肥，不光施水粪，还有草木灰。程鹏问祝翼宏“对不对？”祝翼宏说，对，不仅要氮肥，还要磷肥。商量的结果，就决定要施底肥。当地的习惯，下种只下一粒米或者两粒米。秦必权说，他下过三粒米，增加了生产。技术干部也主张三粒米。商量的结果，就决定下三粒米。当地的习惯是白子下地，技术干部主张根瘤菌拌种。有人误以为这是药怕烂了种。经过程鹏和技术干部解释说，这是一种施肥的方法，于是，就决定用根瘤菌拌种。当地的习惯，花生不密植，程鹏和祝翼宏、秦必权、秦老五等商量，可以实行7×8寸密植。照上面说的办法播种之后，花生苗长的很好。
    又如，在花生薅草的时候，当地的习惯只薅一两道草。程鹏访问了有经验的农民，他们说了三句顺口溜，总结了花生薅草的经验，这就是“头草刮（即薅的浅），二草挖（即薅的深），三、四道草如绣花（即薅的细）”。并且说，在薅二道草的时候，要结合培土壅兜。商量的结果，决定这样做了，花生苗越长越好。
    又如，在抗旱的时候，有人说，“自古以来受了干的花生苗，不能浇水，一浇水就要瘁死。”程鹏和他的助手们研究的结果，受了干的花生苗一样可以浇水。办法是早晚浇，不会“瘁死”。商量的结果，这样做了，战胜了大旱。
    有了这些活的榜样，就召开现场会议，进行参观评比辩论和总结。程鹏就是这样在花生的播种到收获的全部过程中，依靠自己亲身参加的这块试验地，对于全县的花生生产实现了具体领导。其他县委委员和区、乡、社领导干部也都是通过试验田来实现对生产的具体领导。
    领导和群众相结合的钥匙
    各级领导干部亲自种试验田的方法，是最有力量的说服和示范的方法，这种方法的根本特点就是领导干部、技术人员和农民群众三者相结合，对于领导干部、技术人员和农民群众本身都有莫大的好处。对于领导干部来说，通过种试验田，找到了领导和群众相结合的钥匙，找到了打破保守思想，推广先进经验，实行以点带面，点面结合的武器，打开了如何对农业生产实现全面的、深入的、具体的领导的“闷葫芦”，及时地了解了情况，发现了问题，倾听了群众的呼声，集中了群众的智慧，可以有效地避免或者减少工作中的主观主义和命令主义，更好地贯彻执行群众路线的工作方法。对于技术干部来说，得到了领导和群众的支持，提高了钻研技术的积极性，向领导干部学习了群众运动的经验，向农民群众学习了生动活泼的生产经验，既提高了政治思想水平，又提高了技术、业务水平。对于农民群众来说，最切身的实惠是增加了生产，增加了收入，改善了生活，从而更加发挥了集体劳动的积极性和创造性。上面说的这些好处，是领导干部、技术人员、农民群众三者相结合的基础，有了这个基础，试验田的方法，才能得到进一步的巩固和提高。现在试验田已经普遍到各个社和生产队，并且出现了大批的丰产田。
    训练了崭新的技术队伍
    各级领导干部亲自搞试验田的方法，是训练崭新的技术队伍的有效方法。红安县的县、区、乡三级干部七百六十六人（其中有知识分子干部一百二十二人）中，学会了耕田、耙田、防治虫害、选种、拌种、掌握农业季节、栽秧、锄草的干部由1956年的18％，增加到1957年的66.2％。各级领导干部大部分都学会了基本的生产技术。这不仅对于加强生产的具体领导有决定意义，而且对于培养崭新的技术队伍也有决定意义。各级领导干部亲自种试验田，在做的当中，得到教训，提高了觉悟，转变了作风，增长了才干，更进一步获得了群众的爱戴和支持。以前到处不受欢迎，被社员讽刺为“不成人”的张汉兴，在亲自搞了试验田之后，改变了社员对他的看法。社员们说，“张同志在我们社里干一辈子，我们也欢喜。”以前不安心农村工作，被社员讽刺为“洋苕”的知识分子龚全安，在种了试验田，得到群众的表扬以后感慨地说：“出了家门进学门，出了学门进机关，出了机关进社门，谈起生产是黑门。种了试验田，生产入了门。”以前在田岸上检查生产，挨了骂，被社员讽刺为“检查官”的指导组长王树昌，现在被群众呼为“技术员”了。亲自搞了试验田的干部都有这样的体会，从头到尾具体地熟悉了农作物的生产过程，学到了许多极为有用的生产知识，感到对于农业生产的领导，有兴趣，有劲头，有把握了。对于勤劳勇敢的农民群众的感情更加深厚了，对于农村的一切，特别是对于农作物的生长，也发生了感情。八里乡指导组长阮观胜在县里开完抗旱紧急会议以后，时间已是下午了，他赶了七十里路，回到自己所在的社，连门也不进，就赶到田里去看庄稼。没有月光，没有星光，也没有手电，就伏到田埂上用手去摸田里有没有水，他生怕田里的稻苗干死了。红安县的广大干部由“人在乡下，心在城里”转变为“人在城里，心在乡下”和“人在社里，心在田里”了。当然，这些和农民、和土地、和农作物、和农村的一切发生了感情的干部，现在不仅非常安心农村工作，而且建设社会主义新农村的劲头正在越来越大。他们和群众商量的结果，满怀信心地制订了1958年的生产规划，要求1958年全县的粮食和花生的每亩产量都达到九百斤，争取达到一千斤，棉花每亩的产量达到一百斤；要求全县粮食的总产量比1957年增长20％以上，花生的总产量比1957年增长50％以上，棉花的总产量比1957年增长50％。
    这就是红安县的各级领导干部亲自动手种试验田的经过情形。麻城、孝感等县的情形基本上也是这样。红安县委对于这个问题已经进行了一次总结。省委要求各地委、县委也像红安县委一样，在这个问题上进行一次检查和总结，要求他们学习红安县委改变领导方法，转变干部作风，派干部加强落后乡、落后社、落后队的领导，争取社社增产，各种作物样样丰收的经验，特别是要把领导干部亲自种试验田的方法坚持到底地干下去。总之，领导要带头，革新先试验。干劲加办法，跃进定实现。
    以上报告，是否妥当，请中央指示。
