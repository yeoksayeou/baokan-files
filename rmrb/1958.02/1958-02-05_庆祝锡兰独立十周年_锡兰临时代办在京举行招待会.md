Xinhua News Agency, 4th - The Chargé d'Affaires of the Ceylon Embassy in China, Mr. Morse, held a grand reception on the evening of the 4th to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Ceylon's independence. This is the first Independence Day celebration held by Ceylon in our country.

Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai and other national leaders of our country were invited to attend the reception.

Vice Chairman Zhu, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, warmly congratulated the people of Ceylon on the achievements they have made in maintaining independence and building their own country over the past ten years. He said that in order to build their own countries, Ceylon, China, and other newly independent Asian and African countries need not only to make significant efforts themselves, but also to closely unite with each other, strengthen cooperation, support and learn from each other. China and Ceylon have set a good example in this regard.

Vice Chairman Zhu praised Ceylon's beneficial contributions after independence in opposing war, opposing military blocs, and maintaining world peace, promoting peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, opposing colonialism, and maintaining the independence of Asian and African countries, emphasizing that under the current favorable circumstances where peaceful coexistence has become a general trend and popular aspiration around the world, "the Chinese people are willing to work with the people of Ceylon to contribute their own strength to world peace and the happiness of mankind."

In his speech, Vice Chairman Zhu also mentioned that the traditional friendship between China and Ceylon since ancient times is increasingly gaining new development. He also specifically mentioned that Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike has accepted the invitation of our government to visit our country. Vice Chairman Zhu said that the Chinese government and people warmly look forward to the arrival of our distinguished guest. In the new year, the close friendly and cooperative relations that already exist between China and Ceylon will have a broader development.

Premier Zhou Enlai also raised a glass at the reception to congratulate the friendship between the people of China and Ceylon, world peace, and Prime Minister Bandaranaike's health.

Among the guests attending tonight's reception were also Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, and Huang Yanpei, Vice Premiers He Long and Chen Yi, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Bao Erhan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and diplomatic envoys of various countries to China.

In his speech at the beginning of the reception, Chargé d'Affaires Morse welcomed more than 400 Chinese and foreign guests. He first read a telegram from Prime Minister Bandaranaike to Chinese leaders on the occasion of Ceylon's National Day. The telegram stated: "There is a close and friendly relationship between our country and the People's Republic of China. I hope this relationship will continue to grow in the future."

In his speech, Chargé d'Affaires Morse also talked about the various efforts made by the Ceylon government and people in building their own country after independence, Ceylon's position of striving to promote peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among countries around the world to ease the international situation, and the increasingly developing friendly and cooperative relations between Ceylon and China based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Chargé d'Affaires Morse finally said that we oppose all military alliances and armed blocs, and demand an immediate end to all types of colonial rule. He said that colonial rule is a toxic and outdated thing, and it is also one of the main causes of international tension.

At the reception, staff from the Ceylon Embassy in China also performed Ceylon folk dances.

    新华社4日讯　锡兰驻中国大使馆临时代办摩尔西4日晚举行盛大招待会，庆祝锡兰独立十周年。这是锡兰在我国第一次举行的独立日庆祝。
    朱德副主席和周恩来总理等我国国家领导人应邀出席了招待会。
    朱副主席代表中国政府和人民，热烈祝贺锡兰人民十年来在维护独立和建设自己国家方面所取得的成就。他说，锡兰、中国以及其他独立不久的亚非国家为了建设自己的国家，除了本身需要做重大的努力以外，还需要彼此紧密团结、加强合作、互相支持和学习。中锡两国在这方面曾经作出了良好的榜样。
    朱副主席赞扬了锡兰独立后在反对战争、反对军事集团和维护世界和平，促进各国人民的和平共处和友好合作，反对殖民主义和维护亚非国家的独立等方面作出的有益贡献，着重指出在当前和平共处已在全世界成为大势所趋、人心所向的有利情况下，“中国人民愿意同锡兰人民一起，为世界和平和人类的幸福，而贡献出自己的力量。”
    朱副主席在讲话中还谈到中锡两国自古以来的传统友谊正在日益获得新的发展，他并且特别提到锡兰总理班达拉奈克已接受我国政府的邀请将要来我国访问。朱副主席说，中国政府和人民热烈地盼望我们尊贵的客人的光临。在新的一年中，中锡两国之间已存在的亲切的友好合作关系将会有更加广阔的发展。
    周恩来总理在招待会上也举杯祝贺中锡两国人民的友谊、世界和平和班达拉奈克总理的健康。
    在出席今晚招待会的客人中，还有李济深、郭沫若、黄炎培副委员长，贺龙、陈毅副总理，张鼎丞检察长，国防委员会副主席张治中，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉、外交部副部长章汉夫和各国驻华使节。
    摩尔西临时代办在招待会一开始致词欢迎四百多位中外客人时，他首先宣读了班达拉奈克总理在锡兰国庆之际给我国国家领导人的一封电文。这个电文中说：“我国和中华人民共和国之间存在着亲切友好的关系。我希望这种关系今后将日益增进。”
    摩尔西临时代办在讲话中还谈到了锡兰政府和人民在独立后建设自己国家方面所作的各种努力，锡兰努力促进世界各国和平共处与友好合作以缓和国际形势的立场，以及锡中两国建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的日益发展的友好合作关系。
    摩尔西临时代办最后说，我们反对一切军事同盟和武装集团，要求立刻结束任何类型的殖民统治。他说，殖民统治是一个有毒的过了时的东西，也是造成国际紧张局势的主要原因之一。
    招待会上，锡兰驻中国大使馆工作人员还表演了锡兰民间舞蹈。
