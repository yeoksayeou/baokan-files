Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - According to Tass, a national activists' representative meeting of the Japanese Communist Party opened in Tokyo on the 20th.

    The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Sanzo Nosaka, pointed out in his opening speech that the purpose of convening this meeting is to strengthen the struggle of local party organizations and all party members to strive for the dissolution of the Diet. He called on communists to do everything possible to organize the political struggle of the masses, demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of general elections, demanding the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and doing everything possible to strive to seize the leading role in the elections into the hands of the working class and democratic forces.

    Nosaka pointed out that the Japanese working masses, headed by the working class, now demand the resignation of the Liberal Democratic Party government and the organization of new state leadership institutions. Nosaka stressed that the central political task of the Japanese Communist Party is to rely on the working class and the working masses to achieve victory in the general election and to strive to establish a new democratic government. He said that the basic tasks of this government are: to restore diplomatic relations with China; to conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union; to withdraw all American troops from Japanese territory; to recover Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands; to strive for the prohibition of nuclear weapons; to pursue economic policies in line with the interests of the people; and to raise the material living standards of the people.

    Nosaka pointed out that it is possible to establish a democratic government and realize these tasks as long as the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and all domestic democratic forces unite. He pointed out that due to fundamental changes in historical conditions: the overwhelming superiority of the socialist system, the weakening of the ruling class's ruling power, the growth of the working class's power and democratic forces, all this provides the possibility to change the nature of the Diet.

    Nosaka pointed out that in the process of preparing for the Seventh Party Congress, the Communist Party has been strengthened ideologically and organizationally. He called for expanding the influence of the Communist Party in cities and villages. He pointed out that it is necessary to gradually overcome all obstacles hindering the establishment of a united front between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.

    This meeting was convened according to the decision of the Nineteenth Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. The meeting was attended by members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, alternate members of the Central Committee, and secretaries of local party organizations. This representative meeting will be held for three days. The meeting is scheduled to discuss the issue of struggling to dissolve the Diet and striving for a general election, and combining this struggle with the workers' spring offensive to protect their rights and the struggle to defend peace. The meeting will also study the preparations for the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party.

    加强全体党员争取解散国会的斗争
    日共举行全国积极分子代表会议
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社东京讯：日本共产党全国积极分子代表会议20日在东京开幕。
    日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三在致开幕词中指出，召开这次会议的目的是要加强地方党组织和全体党员为争取解散国会而进行的斗争。他号召共产党员尽一切努力组织群众的政治斗争，要求解散国会和举行大选，要求岸信介内阁下台，并且尽一切努力争取把选举中的领导作用掌握在工人阶级和民主力量的手里。
    野坂参三指出，以工人阶级为首的日本劳动群众现在要求自由民主党的政府辞职，并且组织新的国家领导机构。野坂参三着重指出，日本共产党的中心政治任务是：依靠工人阶级和劳动群众在大选中取得胜利，并且争取建立新的民主政府。他说，这个政府的基本任务是：恢复同中国的外交关系；同苏联缔结和约；使一切美国军队撤出日本领土；收回冲绳岛和小笠原群岛；争取禁止核武器；奉行符合人民利益的经济政策；提高人民的物质生活水平。
    野坂参三指出，只要共产党和社会党以及国内一切民主力量联合起来，建立民主政府和实现这些任务是可能的。他指出，由于历史条件起了根本的变化：社会主义体系的压倒优势，统治阶级统治力量的削弱，工人阶级力量和民主力量的增长，这一切都为改变国会的性质提供了可能性。
    野坂参三指出，在筹备第七次党代表大会的过程中，共产党在思想上和组织上都加强了。他号召扩大共产党在城市和乡村中的影响。他指出，必须逐步克服妨碍社会党和共产党建立统一战线的一切障碍。
    这次会议是根据日本共产党中央委员会第十九次扩大会议的决定召开的。参加会议的有日本共产党的中央委员、候补中央委员和地方党组织的书记等。这次代表会议将举行三天。会议预定要讨论为争取解散国会和争取举行大选举而斗争的问题，以及把这一斗争同工人们保护自己权利的春季攻势和保卫和平的斗争结合起来的问题。会议还要研究日本共产党第七次代表大会的筹备情况。
