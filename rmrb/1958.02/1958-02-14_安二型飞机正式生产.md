An-2 Aircraft Goes Into Formal Production
(Our reporter Zhang Pei reports) The An-2 civilian aircraft, successfully trial-produced last December, has now formally gone into production. A large number of parts for the first batch of aircraft are being manufactured at an accelerated pace in various workshops. Due to the needs of the great development of socialist construction, the production of this type of aircraft will be increased by 50% compared to the original plan this year.

In the various workshops of this brand-new aircraft manufacturing plant, the reporter saw that the men and women workers were all very young, but they were already able to skillfully perform various complex technological operations. Orderly and exceptionally clean workshops demonstrate that civilized production, as required by modern large-scale industry, has already been realized in this factory.

According to the Party Secretary of this factory, in addition to mass production this year, they will also focus on solving two problems: one is to continue researching how to make this aircraft more suitable for a wider range of uses. Because now some departments, when placing orders with this factory, are proposing their department's specific requirements. For example, the geological prospecting department hopes that the An-2 aircraft can adapt to the requirements of high-altitude flights; the water transport department hopes that this aircraft can be fitted with pontoons to land on water; and some southern provinces hope that this aircraft can adapt to flights in hot climates. The other issue is to reduce the manufacturing cost of the aircraft, making it inexpensive and of high quality, making it easier for all parties to purchase. This year, it is planned to reduce the ex-factory price of the aircraft by about 16%, and it can continue to be reduced next year.

    安二型飞机正式生产
    本报讯　记者张沛报道：去年12月试制成功的安二型民用飞机，今年已经正式生产。供首批飞机用的大量零件，正在各个车间加速制造。由于社会主义建设大发展的需要，今年这种飞机的生产将比原计划提高50％。
    在这个崭新的飞机制造厂的各个车间里，记者看到的男女工人都十分年青，但是他们都已经能熟练地进行各种复杂的工艺操作。车间里秩序井然而且异常整洁，现代大工业所需要的文明生产，在这个工厂里已经实现。
    据这个工厂的党委书记告诉记者，今年他们除了进行成批生产以外，还要着重解决两个问题：一个是继续研究使这种飞机更多地适用于多种用途。因为现在有些部门向这个工厂订货时，都提出本部门的特种要求。如地质勘探部门希望安二飞机能适应高原飞行的要求；水上运输部门希望这种飞机安装上浮筒能在水面降落；南方一些省份，希望这种飞机能适应炎热气候下的飞行。另一个问题是降低飞机的制造成本，作到价廉物美，更便于各方面购买。今年就计划把飞机的出厂价格降低16％左右，明年还可以继续降低。
