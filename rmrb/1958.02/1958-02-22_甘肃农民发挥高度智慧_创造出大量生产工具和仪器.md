    (Reported by this newspaper) In the struggle to build farmland irrigation and change the face of drought, the masses in Gansu Province have displayed great wisdom and created and invented various instruments and tools. According to incomplete statistics, to date, farmers and workers throughout the province have successfully created more than a hundred kinds of tools for surveying, construction, and water lifting. In terms of surveying instruments, there is the simple "hand level" made by Ma Ruoguo, a farmer in Xiaji Township, Guanghe County, using an old eye-drop bottle, and the "single-frame level" made by Zhao Jia Agricultural Cooperative in Paizi Ping Township, etc. In terms of construction tools, there are the "high-line automatic soil transportation method," "pile driver," "lever stone rammer," "wooden crane," "double-wheel five-furrow soil shovel," "soil leveling rake," "soil piling rake," etc., created in Wudu, Qin'an, Tianshui, Huining, Yuzhong, and Guanghe. In terms of water-lifting tools, there are the "wooden manual water pump," "bellows-type water pump," "wooden double-chain water lifting cart," "hydraulic automatic waterwheel," "wooden water press," "automatic double-pipe waterwheel," "windmill waterwheel," "pedal waterwheel," etc., totaling more than twenty kinds successfully created in Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County, Tongwei, Wuwei, Qin'an, Wushan, Minqin, Gangu, Longxi, Tongxin, and Yongjing counties.
    The creation and invention of these instruments and tools can not only solve the difficulties in construction and water use, but also reduce the burden of labor and promote the early completion of projects.
