A Pre-Festival Market Tour of Tianjin

The commercial workers of Tianjin Municipality began preparing New Year's goods for the citizens a month in advance. Many stores added items that people liked, based on suggestions made by residents during the "speaking out" period. The Tianxiang Shopping Mall increased its variety of colorful velvet and silk flowers and potted flowers by more than 50 types compared to previous years. The Municipal Department Store, according to the different preferences of the citizens, specially transported various types of scarves, socks, and other daily necessities from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and other places. In order to eliminate queuing, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee, based on suggestions made by citizens during the "speaking out" period, adopted temporary rationed supply measures for eight major non-staple foods, such as pork, beef, fresh eggs, pastries, and white sugar, one week before the Spring Festival. Employees of stores throughout the city are launching a good service campaign. Department stores and clothing and shoe companies have added more than 170 sales counters, as well as more than 130 temporary stalls and mobile sales vehicles, delivering New Year's goods to people's doorsteps. Commercial employees in more than a dozen industries, including pork, beef and mutton, groceries, and fruits, pre-boned, packaged, and bundled New Year's goods, so that customers no longer have to queue up like in the past.

Citizens are satisfied with the commercial departments' work in supplying New Year's goods this year. On the other hand, after undergoing socialist education and the rectification movement, families throughout the city are planning how to have a simple and enjoyable Spring Festival. Although the stores are crowded with people shopping for New Year's goods, the types and quantities of New Year's goods they are buying are very different from previous years. The sales revenue of Tianjin's largest store, Heping Road Department Store, in the five days from the 20th to the 24th of the twelfth lunar month this year, was about 29% less compared to the same period last year; the sales volume of woolen fabrics, wool, woolen sweaters and trousers, and men's and women's leather shoes, which were once in short supply last year, decreased by 30% to 60% this year. Watches, which used to sell well, sold 400 pieces in these five days last year, but only 125 pieces in these five days this year. And beautiful and practical towels, printed handkerchiefs, headbands and other popular goods are selling more than in previous years. The Tianjin Women and Children's Store saw a 16% decrease in sales of various women's leather shoes compared to the same period last year, while sales of popular women's casual shoes increased by more than two times. The non-staple food New Year's goods supplied throughout the city from the 23rd of the twelfth lunar month have far from reached the daily sales plan in the past three days, with pork only completing 42%; beef completing 22%; and fresh eggs and pastries completing 48% and 40% respectively.

While preparing to have a frugal Spring Festival, people are very enthusiastic about investing money in the country's industrial and agricultural construction. Since the 19th of the twelfth lunar month, people throughout the city have been subscribing to public bonds, and in just five days, they have subscribed to 11 million yuan, reaching more than 60% of the planned total sales. Many people paid cash on the spot. Although people's savings in banks throughout the city have also decreased as usual before the Spring Festival, they have increased by more than 15 million yuan compared to the same period last year. Many cadres from government agencies, organizations, and enterprises who have been sent down to the countryside for training have also invested large sums of money in the agricultural cooperatives where they are located.

    节日前的天津市场巡礼
    天津市商业工作人员们，早在一个月前就为市民准备年货了，许多商店根据居民们在鸣放中提的意见，增添了很多人们喜爱的货品。天祥商场里鲜艳的绒绢花、瓶花比往年增加五十多种。市百货公司依照市民不同的爱好，特地从上海、广州、南京等地运来了各色各样的纱巾、袜子等日用品。为了消灭排队现象，天津市人民委员会根据市民“鸣放”中提出的建议，在春节前一个星期，对猪肉、牛肉、鲜鸡蛋、糕点、白糖等八种主要副食品，采取了临时凭证定量供应的办法。全市商店的职工正在掀起一个服务良好运动。百货公司和服装鞋帽公司增加了一百七十多个售货柜，还增添临时售货摊和流动售货车一百三十多处，游街串巷的把年货送上门去。全市猪肉、牛羊肉、杂货、水果等十多个行业的商业职工，事先将年货剔骨、包包、打捆，使顾客不再像过去那样排队等候。
    市民们对今年商业部门的年货供应工作感到满意。另一方面，全市人民经过社会主义教育和整风运动，家家户户都在计划着如何过一个又朴素又愉快的春节。商店里虽然挤满了采办年货的人群，但是他们所采办的年货品种和数量都和往年大有不同。天津市最大的商店——和平路百货大楼今年旧历腊月20到24日五天的营业额，与去年同期比较少29％左右；去年曾经供不应求的呢绒衣料、毛料、毛衣裤和男女皮鞋，今年的销售量下降了30％到60％。一向畅售的手表，去年的这五天销售了四百只，今年的这五天只销一百二十五只。而美观实用的毛巾、印花手帕、发带等大众化的货品，比往年销得多了。天津市妇女儿童商店销售的各种女皮鞋比去年同期下降16％，而大众化的女便鞋却增加了两倍多。全市从旧历腊月23日开始供应的副食年货，三天来远远没有达到日销售计划，猪肉仅完成42％；牛肉完成22％；鲜蛋、糕点分别完成48％和40％。
    人们在准备俭朴过春节的同时，把钱投到祖国工农业建设中去的劲头很大。全市人民自旧历腊月19日开始认购公债，仅五天的时间，已认购一千一百万元，达到预定推销总数的60％以上，不少人当场交了现款。全市人民在银行的存款虽然也照例在春节前有所下降，但比去年同期增加了一千五百多万元。许多机关、团体、企业单位下放农村锻炼的干部，还向所在的农业社投了大笔资金。（据新华社讯）
