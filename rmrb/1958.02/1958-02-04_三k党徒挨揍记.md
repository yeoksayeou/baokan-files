　　Record of a Klan Beating

　　Robeson County, North Carolina, is a small county with a population of only 95,000. The county has 30,000 Native Americans, descendants of the Lumbee tribe, who have lived here for centuries and most of whom are now farmers.

　　Although there are not many white people in this county, racial discrimination is very prevalent. Schools, restaurants, movie theaters, and other public places all practice segregation among whites, blacks, and Native Americans. The Ku Klux Klan members here are even more lawless. They were greatly angered by the recent move of two Native American families into white residential areas in the county. So they burned crosses in front of these two Native American families' homes, threatening them to abandon their demands for racial equality as soon as possible. They also openly distributed leaflets, calling on Ku Klux Klan members to hold an armed rally on the evening of January 18, preparing to take persecutory actions against Native Americans to "maintain" the notorious system of racial discrimination.

　　According to American press reports, although the Lumbee people are "valiant," they are peace-loving. However, the provocations of the racists aroused their resentment, and they were determined to retaliate.

　　It was a dark and windy night. More than a hundred swaggering Ku Klux Klan members gathered with guns in a field outside Maxton, the county seat. They set up a lectern, installed electric lights and amplifiers, and held a rally. Just as the Ku Klux Klan leader (a Baptist minister) stepped onto the lectern in a grand manner to announce the start of the meeting, hundreds of Native Americans who had been ambushed in the nearby bushes suddenly appeared. They shot out the electric lights, and together fired their guns and shouted, surrounding the venue and kicking over the lectern. According to descriptions in some American newspapers, the Ku Klux Klan "warriors," who had always been tyrannical toward blacks and Native Americans, were originally just a bunch of cowards. The terrified and frightened Ku Klux Klan members then abandoned their guns and fled in disarray. Some got into cars to escape, while others crawled under the cars, creating a chaotic scene. If a large number of state troopers had not arrived in time to fire tear gas to protect the Ku Klux Klan members, they would have suffered greatly!

　　三K党徒挨揍记
    美国北卡罗丰纳州罗伯逊县是一个仅有九万五千人口的小县份。这个县有三万名印第安人，他们是兰比族的后裔，数世纪以来就居住在这里，目前大部人务农为生。
    这个县的白种人虽然不多，但种族歧视却很盛行，无论学校、饭馆、电影院及其他公共场所，都实行白人、黑人和印第安人的三种隔离。这里的三K党徒更是无法无天，他们对这个县最近有两家印第安人迁到白种人住宅区一事大为震怒，于是在这两家印第安人门前焚烧十字架，威吓他们及早放弃种族平等的要求，并且公开散发传单，号召三K党徒在1月18日晚上举行武装集会，准备对印第安人采取迫害行动来“维护”臭名昭著的种族歧视制度。
    据美国报刊报道，兰比族人虽然“慓悍”，但是他们都是爱好和平的。然而种族主义者的挑衅行为激起他们的愤恨，他们决心给予还击。
    这是一个月黑风高的夜晚，一百多名神气活现的三K党徒携带了枪械在这个县的马斯通镇外的野地里集合，他们布置了讲坛，装起电灯和扩音器，举行集会。正当三K党大头目（一个浸信会牧师）大模大样登上讲坛宣布开会时，预先埋伏在附近灌木丛里的数百名印第安人突然出现，他们开枪击灭了电灯，一起鸣枪呐喊，包围了会场，踢翻了讲坛。根据一些美国报刊的描写，一向对黑人和印第安人作威作福的三K党“勇士”们原来尽是些脓包，吓破胆和吓昏了的三K党徒们这时纷纷抛弃了枪械，抱头乱窜，有的坐上汽车准备逃命，有的钻入车底，乱作一团，若不是大批州警及时赶到，对印第安人施放催泪弹庇护三K党徒，他们就要大吃苦头了！
