Building Bridges and Rowing Boats Across the Yellow River and Yangtze River for Agriculture
    Qin County United Processing Plant Formulates Grand Plan

    (Our Dispatch) The Shanxi Provincial Local State-Operated Qin County United Processing Plant recently formulated a comprehensive plan to support the great leap forward in agriculture, based on the needs of local agricultural development and the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft).

    Qin County recently proposed a grand goal for agricultural leap forward: a grain yield of 250 jin per mu this year (an increase of 100 jin compared to 1957), 330 jin next year, 400 jin in three years, cross the Yellow River in five years, and cross the Yangtze River in ten years. In order to promote the realization of this goal, party and government leaders and technicians of the Qin County United Processing Plant went deep into the countryside and water conservancy construction sites to conduct investigations and visits, and invited the directors and party branch secretaries of five agricultural cooperatives in five townships, including Changsheng and Yaoshan, to conduct discussions to understand the needs of the countryside in the great leap forward. Based on these new requirements, they determined a comprehensive plan to support agriculture. Their slogan is: "Do everything possible to build bridges and row boats across the Yellow River and Yangtze River for agriculture." They will save 500,000 labor days for farmers in 1958 and trial-produce and imitate 20 decisive new products. The specific goals are:

    Actively support farmland water conservancy construction. Undertake the manufacturing of simple levels for surveying terrain, small drilling rigs for geological exploration, and complete sets of high-pressure sluice gates, water inlet gates, river flushing gates, reserve gates, and large and small mechanical equipment such as fish barriers for regulating and controlling water flow. They will also trial-produce a small excavator (which can replace five people digging soil), five types of soil transportation tools, and two types of ramming tools, as well as a soil firmness tester and ring cutter testing device, based on the principles of adapting to local conditions, being lightweight and flexible, and having low prices and applicability. According to the designed capacity, the application of these eight small machines for excavating, transporting, and ramming on the three large reservoirs that will begin construction this year alone can save 160,000 labor days. In terms of water lifting tools, they plan to trial-produce four types of lifting tools: lightweight pedal waterwheels, automatic water diversion irrigators, hand-operated water pumps, and centrifugal water pumps. Once these small tools are successfully trial-produced, they can provide a complete set of equipment for small-scale mechanized construction of farmland water conservancy and the use of small-scale mechanical irrigation of fields.

    Exploit local fertilizer sources and actively expand fertilizer production. This factory decided to increase the planned production of 1,500 tons of granular fertilizer in 1958 to 3,000 tons, and to mine 10 million jin of peat for agricultural cooperatives to use as bedding to increase manure. They will use local saltpeter soil and wood ash to produce 210,000 jin of brine fertilizer, and at the same time help agricultural cooperatives establish 56 brine production groups. These two items can produce a total of 4.2 million jin of brine fertilizer. They will use local bones to trial-produce bone fertilizer. The above three types of fertilizers can be used as base fertilizer on 150,000 mu of land, accounting for 31.91% of the total cultivated area; and as top dressing on 210,000 mu of land, accounting for 43.3% of the total cultivated area. In order to fully exert the effectiveness of these fertilizers, they will further study the formulation methods, application methods, and which types of soil they are suitable for.

    Continue to produce the successfully trial-produced power-driven small steel mills, rice milling machines, and corn cob grinders, so that all 29 townships in the county are equipped with small steel mills, rice milling machines, and corn cob grinders. This can save 295,320 man-days and animal-days a year. Prepare to trial-manufacture a straw cutter that can be powered by human power, animal power, and mechanical power. They will also manufacture soybean cake crushers, so that the factory can uniformly process and crush soybean cakes, so that agricultural cooperatives can directly obtain ready-made livestock feed. This will greatly reduce the physical labor of farmers, especially reducing the burden of trivial daily tasks on rural women, so as to free up more manpower and animal power for production and construction.

    Gradually reform the backward farming tools in rural areas based on local conditions and the characteristics of agricultural production. They plan to study and trial-manufacture power-driven double-shared plows, animal-powered land leveling machines, weeding machines, and drought-resistant seeding drills. They will also reform transportation tools such as iron-wheeled carts on the basis of the existing ones. In a few years, the agricultural farming tools and transportation tools in this county will undergo great changes.

    Fully utilize local resources and develop local specialty product processing. They plan to use corn cobs, wheat bran, rice bran, sorghum husks, etc. to make wine, use apricot kernels, peach kernels, and wild oilseeds to make oil, use soybean cakes to make soy sauce, use oil residue to make soap, use eggshells to make eggshell powder (livestock feed), and use fruits to make candied fruits and dried fruit skins. This can make use of a large number of local specialties in rural areas to increase farmers' income.

    Organize two specialized teams: a technical support team (14 people) responsible for water conservancy construction projects throughout the county. Their task is to go to construction sites to survey terrain, explore geology, solve various difficulties in the construction process, assemble all the mechanical equipment of the reservoir, and help rural areas establish small-scale hydroelectric or thermal power stations. The other is a mobile maintenance team (8 people) responsible for the installation, repair, and maintenance of boiler-tractor machines, diesel engines, and various new agricultural implements throughout the county. They will make a circuit every half month to inspect and repair agricultural cooperatives with mechanical equipment, and can also be called upon at any time. They also plan to produce some general-purpose machine parts. With the mobile maintenance team as the center, help handicraft cooperatives establish five agricultural implement repair stations in five market towns and townships such as Nanli and Guocun to form a repair and maintenance network for agricultural machinery throughout the county.

    Cultivate agricultural machinery technical personnel. They plan to train 100 people for agricultural cooperatives in 1958 who can operate machines. The methods are: (1) go to the countryside to impart technology; (2) workers and agricultural cooperative members sign apprenticeship contracts; (3) organize agricultural cooperative members to practice in the factory (ten to fifteen days at a time). This factory will become a central school for cultivating rural technical forces throughout the county.

    They have also determined some measures to ensure the realization of this plan: (1) closely combine with county-level agricultural departments, do a good job in market research in rural areas, and frequently contact agricultural cooperatives, so that employees can keep abreast of changes in agricultural production and rural areas; (2) in terms of trial-producing new products, the factory's agricultural machinery trial-production and research group will be the main body, and contact relevant technical departments and experienced veteran farmers and old technicians in rural areas to jointly study, jointly trial-produce, and jointly appraise; (3) establish fixed contacts with five agricultural cooperatives in different regions as a base for their research and trial production of agricultural machinery; (4) absorb experience from various places and organize workers to visit and study in other places; (5) overcome conservative ideas, eliminate wasteful phenomena, strive to improve technical level, improve product quality, and strengthen enterprise management and reduce costs in the spirit of diligence and thrift; (6) industry and agriculture leap forward together. In 1958, this factory will increase to 11 industries (only 7 in 1957), the main products will increase to 85 (55 in 1957), and the total output value will increase to 1,005,000 yuan, nearly double that of 1957.

    Now all employees are working selflessly and creatively to realize this plan. In early January, the firmness tester and ring cutter testing device used in water conservancy projects have been successfully trial-produced. Small excavators, hand-operated water pumps, centrifugal water pumps, straw cutters, weeding machines, etc. have been made into models.

　　为农业跨黄河过长江架桥撑船
    沁县联合加工厂制定宏伟规划
    本报讯　山西省地方国营沁县联合加工厂最近根据当地农业发展的需要和全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的精神，制定出了全面支援农业大跃进的规划。
    沁县最近提出了农业跃进的宏伟目标：今年粮食亩产二百五十斤（比1957年增长一百斤），明年三百三十斤，三年四百斤，五年过黄河，十年过长江。为了促进这一目标的实现，沁县联合加工厂的党政领导干部和技术工人深入农村和水利建设工地进行调查访问，并邀请长盛、尧山等五个乡五个农业社的社主任和党支部书记进行座谈，了解了农村在大跃进中的需要。根据这些新的要求，他们确定了全面支援农业的规划。他们的行动口号是：“千方百计，为农业跨黄河过长江架桥撑船”。他们要在1958年为农民节约五十万个劳动力，试制、仿制二十种有决定性的新产品。具体的目标是：
    积极支援农田水利建设。承制全县测量地形的简易水平仪，勘查地质的小型钻探机，调解控制水量出入的全套高压闸、进水闸、冲河闸、预备闸以及拦鱼网等大小型机械装备。还要本着因地制宜、轻便灵活、价低适用的原则，试制一种小型挖土机（可代替五个人刨土），五种运送土工具，两种打夯工具，以及查验土质的坚实仪、环刀试验器等。以上挖土、运土、打夯的八种小型机械，按设计能力计算，仅是在今年开始施工的三个大型水库上应用，就可以节省十六万个劳动力。在提水工具方面，准备试制轻便脚踏水车，自动引水灌溉器，手摆水泵，离心水泵等四种提升工具。这些小型工具试制成功以后，可以为农田水利建设的小型机械化施工和采用小型机械灌溉田地提供一整套设备。
    就地挖掘肥源，积极扩大肥料生产。这个工厂决定把1958年生产一千五百吨颗粒肥料的计划增加到三千吨，并要开采一千万斤泥炭，供给农业社垫圈，以增加圈肥。要利用当地的硝土和柴灰，生产二十一万斤滷水肥料，同时帮助农业社建立五十六个滷水生产小组。这两项共可生产滷水肥料四百二十万斤。利用当地骨头，试制骨肥。以上三种肥料可以供十五万亩土地上底肥，占总耕地面积的31.91％；供二十一万亩地上追肥，占总耕地面积的43.3％。为了使这些肥料充分发挥效能，他们要进一步研究配制方法、使用方法以及适用哪几种土壤。
    继续生产已经试制成功的动力小钢磨、碾米机、玉米轴磨粉机等产品，使全县二十九个乡都安装上小钢磨、碾米机、玉米轴磨粉机。这样一年可以节省二十九万五千三百二十个人力、畜力。准备试造一种人力、畜力、动力三用的铡草机。还要制造豆饼粉碎机，以便由厂里统一加工粉碎豆饼，使农业社能直接拿到粉碎现成的牲畜饲料。这样就会大大减轻农民的体力劳动，特别是减少农村妇女日常生活杂务琐事的牵累，以便腾出更多的人力、畜力投入生产建设中去。
    根据当地条件和农业生产特点，逐步地改革农村落后的耕作工具。他们计划研究试制动力双铧犁，畜力平整土地机，锄苗器以及抗旱播种耧等小型农业机具。并要在旧有的基础上改制铁轮马车等运输工具。几年以后，这个县的农业耕作工具和运输工具将会发生很大的变化。
    充分利用当地资源，发展土特产品加工。他们计划利用玉米轴、麸皮、谷糠、高粱壳等酿酒，利用杏仁、桃仁、野生油料制油，利用豆饼制酱油，利用油渣制肥皂，利用蛋壳制蛋壳粉（牲畜饲料），利用水果制果脯、果干皮。这样可以把农村中大量的土特产利用起来，以增加农民的收入。
    组织两支专门队伍：一支技术支援队（十四人），负责全县的水利建设工程。他们的任务是：到工地去，测量地形，钻探地质，解决施工过程中的各种困难，装配水库的一切机械设备，并且帮助农村建立小型水力或火力发电站。另一支是流动检修组（八人），负责全县锅驼机、柴油机及各种新式农具的安装修配。每隔半个月要巡回到有机械设备的农业社检修一次，还可以随叫随到，随到随修。他们还准备生产一些通用机器零件。以流动检修组为中心，帮助手工业社在南里、郭村等五个集镇乡建立五个农具修配站，以构成全县农村机具的修配网。
    培养农业机械技术人材。他们计划在1958年为农业社培养能够操作机器的人材一百名。办法是：（一）下乡传授技术；（二）工人和农业社员订立师徒合同；（三）组织农业社员到厂实习（一次十至十五天）。这个厂将成为全县培养农村技术力量的一座中心学校。
    他们还确定了一些保证实现这一规划的措施：（一）密切同县级农业部门的结合，做好农村市场的调查研究，经常同农业社联系，以便使职工们能及时了解农业生产和农村中的变化。（二）在试制新产品方面，以厂的农业机械试制研究小组为主，联系有关技术部门和有经验的老农、农村中的老技术人员共同研究，共同试制，共同鉴定。（三）同五个不同地区的农业社建立固定的联系，作为他们研究试制农业机械的基地。（四）吸取各地经验，组织工人到外地参观学习。（五）克服保守思想，消除浪费现象，努力提高技术水平，改进产品质量，以勤俭的精神去加强企业管理，降低成本。（六）工农业一齐跃进。1958年这个厂要增加到十一种行业（1957年只有七种），主要产品要增加到八十五种（1957年五十五种），总产值要增加到一百万零五千元，比1957年增长近一倍。
    现在全体职工正为实现这一规划而忘我地进行创造性的劳动。一月上旬，水利工程上使用的坚实仪、环刀试验器已经试制成功。小型挖土机、手摇水泵、离心水泵、铡草机、锄草器等已经制成模型。
