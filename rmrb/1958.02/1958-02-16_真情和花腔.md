　　Sincerity and Rhetoric
　　The United States's black hand has once again been caught in Syria. The conspiracy plotted by the United States against the Syrian government has been exposed in broad daylight. U.S. State Department Press Officer White hastily came out to deny it, saying, "We absolutely and categorically deny this allegation." However, he couldn't offer any reasons to justify himself, only using an American "catchphrase" to slander the Syrian military spokesman, saying, "This kind of rhetoric is familiar to everyone."
　　A group of armed special agents has already been captured by Syria. These scoundrels are equipped with American weapons and carrying funds provided by the United States. The evidence is irrefutable, and it cannot be denied with empty words. This method of subversive activity by the United States and this shameless "rhetoric" are indeed familiar to everyone.

    真情和花腔
    美国的黑手又一次在叙利亚被抓住了。美国策划的反对叙利亚政府的阴谋已暴露在光天化日之下。美国国务院新闻发布官怀特急忙出来抵赖说，“我们绝对和断然否认这种说法。”但是，他却举不出任何理由来自圆其说，只是用了一句美国的“口头禅”来诬蔑叙利亚军方发言人说，“这种腔调是大家所熟悉的”。
    一批武装特务已经被叙利亚捕获，这些坏蛋装配的是美国武器，携带的是美国拿出的经费，罪证确凿，岂是空口说白话所能抵赖得了的。美国这种进行颠复活动的手法和这种无耻的“腔调”倒是大家所熟悉的。
