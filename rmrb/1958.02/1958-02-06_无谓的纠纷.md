Notes

    A Pointless Dispute
    Recently, West Germany and the United States, Britain, and France, particularly with Britain, have been arguing intensely over the issue of troop support. West Germany is unwilling to continue paying for the costs of the three countries' stationed troops, while the US and Britain insist that West Germany continue to pay. It seems that the dispute is difficult to resolve.

    The reason the problem cannot be solved is that both sides seem to have their own reasons, but in reality, neither has any reason. The so-called reason is that both West Germany and the United States, Britain, and France see the cost of stationing troops as an extra burden that should be paid by the other side. The so-called lack of reason is that neither side is willing to support these troops, but both insist that these troops are necessary in West Germany.

    In fact, the problem is also easy to solve, that is to accept the Soviet Union's proposal and realize the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Germany.

    无谓的纠纷
    最近西德和美英法三国，特别是和英国在驻军供养问题上争吵得很激烈。西德不肯继续支付三国驻军的费用，美英法则一定要西德继续掏钱。看样子，纠纷颇难解决。
    问题所以解决不了，是因为双方好像都各有道理，而实际上都没有道理。所谓有道理是西德和美英法都把驻军的费用看成是额外的负担，应当由对方支付。所谓没道理，是双方都不肯供养这些驻军，但是却又都坚持说这些军队驻在西德是必要的。
    其实问题也很容易解决，那就是接受苏联的建议，实现从德国撤走一切外国军队。
