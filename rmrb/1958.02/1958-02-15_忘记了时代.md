    Forgetting the Times
    French planes bombed and killed seventy or eighty Tunisian civilians, a bloody mess. The French government, however, argued that "this was a legitimate act of self-defense." The Tunisian people, unable to endure it any longer, demanded that the French troops get out of Tunisia and took some necessary measures to restrict the movement and outings of the French troops stationed there. However, they still allowed the sick to be sent to hospitals, allowed some smaller strongholds of French troops to withdraw to larger strongholds, and could provide assistance to French troops who wanted to board ships and withdraw. This can be described as the utmost in benevolence and righteousness. But the French government also declared that "this is a violation of international law." It truly is a vivid portrayal of the ferocious features of colonialism: only I am allowed to arbitrarily slaughter and carve you up, and you are not allowed to resist in the slightest.
    Unfortunately, the French colonialists have forgotten that it is now the 1960s, and it is no longer a slave society. The Tunisian people, who have stood up, will no longer allow others to slaughter them. Regarding the French threats, the Tunisian President expressed himself very firmly: if the Tunisian army is attacked in any way, he will retaliate with force. If necessary, he will join the guerrillas and have all the Tunisian people follow him in participating.

    忘记了时代
    法国飞机炸死了突尼斯七、八十个平民，血肉横飞，法国政府却强辩说：“这是正当的自卫行动。”突尼斯人民忍无可忍，要求法军滚出突尼斯，并且采取了一些必要的措施，限止法国驻突军队的移动和外出，不过，仍然允许把病员送进医院，容许一些较小据点的法军撤到较大的据点，对于要登船撤走的法军可给以帮助，可谓仁至义尽。可是法国政府还又声明说：“这是违反国际法”的。真是活脱的一副殖民主义者的凶相：只准我任意屠杀宰割，不容你一丝反抗。
    可惜，法国殖民者忘记了，现在是二十世纪六十年代，已经不是奴隶社会了。站了起来的突尼斯人民，再不会听任他人宰割了。对于法国的威胁，突尼斯总统表示得很坚决：如果突尼斯军受到任何攻击，他将用武力来回敬。如果必要的话，他将加入游击队，并且使全体突尼斯人民跟着他参加。
