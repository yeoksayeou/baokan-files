Rooting out all waste in state organs
Our Commentator

	When "Opposing waste and building the country through diligence and thrift" becomes the action slogan of the people of the whole country, state organs and institutions should take opposing waste as one of the main contents of the in-depth rectification stage, ignite a raging fire, burn away all extravagant and wasteful phenomena in the organs, and eliminate officialdom and lethargy.
	Recently, some units of the central state organs that have made rapid progress in rectification have launched a struggle against waste, and in just a few days, they have exposed a large number of shocking waste phenomena. According to preliminary revelations from the Paper Industry Design Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry, waste reached more than 39 million yuan in the 17 newly built and expanded projects in recent years. In various economic departments, the waste caused by shortcomings in planning, design, and material allocation is very serious. Similarly, in the cultural departments, which seem to be "clean" departments in the impression of ordinary people, a large number of intolerable waste phenomena have also been exposed. In the art institutions under the Ministry of Culture, the atmosphere of extravagance and competition for luxury is very serious. They spend state funds lavishly on clothing, props, and scenery without any sense of regret. The cost of clothing and props for a single play often amounts to tens of thousands of yuan. The waste in printing and publishing is also very serious. The Beijing Distribution Office of Xinhua Bookstore alone has suffered losses of more than 1.8 million yuan in the past three years due to price reductions and scrapping of books. The waste of manpower in state organs is also alarming. Taking the art institutions under the Ministry of Culture as an example, it is common to see actors not performing for a long time and directors not directing for a long time. It has been revealed that an actor in the Central Experimental Opera House only made a one minute and twenty-one second broadcast on the radio last year, and a director has taken more than 30,000 yuan in wages in seven or eight years, but has often used the excuse of a bad script to not direct a movie. Many famous actors only perform a dozen or dozens of plays a year. According to estimates by the person in charge of the Ministry of Culture, after this exposure, on the basis of the already devolved staff, it is possible to continue to reduce and devolve about 15% of the cadres. The examples of just these few organs can already illustrate that opposing waste in state organs is by no means a pointless exercise, but has great potential.
	Opposing waste in state organs not only has great economic significance, but also has a particularly huge role in politics and ideology. Without opposing waste, it is impossible for diligence and thrift in building the country and running all undertakings to become the guiding principle for the actions of state organs; without opposing waste, it is impossible to completely eliminate officialdom and lethargy, to reform the atmosphere of the organs, and to inspire revolutionary enthusiasm; without opposing waste, bourgeois ideology will not easily be subjected to profound exposure and criticism.
	The reasons for such serious waste phenomena are multifaceted. From the analysis of some typical designs by units such as the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Chemical Industry, it can be seen that some engineering and technical personnel still do not understand that we not only require more, faster, and better, but also require saving, and that we cannot fully adopt new technologies and equipment at this time, and must use some backward technologies and equipment. Because they do not understand this principle, they blindly demand that everything be modern and automated, and demand that they immediately catch up with international levels in terms of technology and equipment, and order a large number of foreign equipment without asking whether it is necessary. The "79 Project" designed by the Paper Industry Design Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry could have had more than 90% of its equipment manufactured domestically, but the design used 100% imported equipment, and some of the equipment manufactured domestically was of very good quality. The blind purchase of foreign orders alone in this project wasted 12 million yuan. As for the bad habit of emphasizing ostentation and competing for luxury, it still seriously exists in state organs and their affiliated institutions. And there are still many people who find excuses for this behavior, saying that this is the national spirit and international level that should be possessed. These comrades have completely forgotten to proceed from the actual situation of our country, and do not understand that in our country, which is both poor, blank, and large, the so-called national spirit can only be diligence, thrift, and hard struggle, and definitely not luxury and extravagance. Emphasizing ostentation and showing off wealth is the decadent and declining atmosphere of spendthrifts and bankrupts, and definitely not the prosperous and upward atmosphere of builders who start their families and build their businesses.
	Many waste phenomena come from officialdom, and many waste phenomena have fueled the spread of officialdom and lethargy. Many waste phenomena are so obvious and so serious, why have the responsible cadres not known about them for a long time? Why do some units not implement the correct business policies, and the leadership is completely unaware? This cannot but be attributed to the bureaucratic style of the leaders of these departments who do not understand the situation below and do not personally handle the problems. When the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Ministry of Light Industry exposed the serious waste in the design work, they found that some important engineering designs, the leaders in the ministry and the design institute rarely asked about them at ordinary times, and after the design was completed, they did not personally review it, but only listened to the reports from the lower-level cadres and passed it off. Indeed, many leading comrades do not pay attention to political and ideological work, tolerate the rampant bourgeois ideology among the staff, abandon the position of the working class ideology, especially to a few famous technical personnel and art workers too much accommodation, abandoned the necessary political and ideological education.
	It should be pointed out that most of the waste phenomena are rooted in the foundation of bourgeois ideology, and at the same time, they prepare a favorable climate and soil for the growth of bourgeois ideology. The result of the corrosion of our state organs and enterprises and institutions by bourgeois design concepts, bourgeois artistic concepts, and bourgeois management and management ideas has not only caused a lot of waste, but also increased the distance between state organs and enterprises and institutions and the working people. The Central Experimental Opera House under the Ministry of Culture, because of the pursuit of luxurious costumes, scenery, and props, when performing in other places, it takes two or three train cars to transport costumes and scenery. Such a mighty team cannot only not go down to factories and rural areas, but also cannot go down to small and medium-sized cities. The bourgeois departmentalism and individualism make some comrades compete for cadres, materials, and equipment everywhere. Some personnel of art troupes live in comfort and lead a bourgeois life, and even their skills have declined. A famous Peking Opera actor rarely performs at ordinary times, and he does not practice hard, so he used to be able to flip dozens of somersaults in a row without changing his face, but now he sweats profusely after flipping a few somersaults. When the people of the whole country are inspiring revolutionary enthusiasm and preparing to work hard for three years to leap forward, some of our state organ staff and art workers are lethargic and spoiled to such an extent, is this not enough to prompt us to wake up immediately? Now, we should expose the harm of bourgeois ideology to our construction undertakings concretely and in large quantities through the anti-waste struggle, and clearly establish the idea of building the country through diligence and thrift and running all undertakings through diligence and thrift, which may more effectively enhance people's resistance and immunity to bourgeois ideology.
	In order to completely eliminate all waste phenomena, it is necessary to organize the masses to conduct repeated debates. Some units have proposed to "settle accounts economically and dig up roots ideologically," that is, to clarify the nature of the problem through debate, dig out the ideological roots, find ways to overcome waste and plug loopholes, and formulate plans to increase production and practice economy and improve related work. In organizing debates, it is necessary to be good at organizing debates on various different opinions, and pay special attention to giving those comrades who have wrong understandings but have not yet figured out their thinking a chance to speak, otherwise their ideological problems cannot be solved, and it is not easy to make everyone truly distinguish between the correct and wrong ideological boundaries. It is best to widely absorb comrades from grass-roots units and related parties to participate in the debate, so as to debate the issues deeply and thoroughly. Once the masses are mobilized, they will inevitably expose a large number of waste phenomena, and it is of course impossible to debate them one by one. This requires the leadership to find out the main aspects of waste in their own organs, and at the same time, select typical issues from them for debate. Once typical issues are debated clearly, the rest of the similar issues can be easily resolved.
	There are many problems that need to be solved in in-depth rectification, but it is necessary to grasp the important link of opposing waste. If this link is grasped and the problem is solved, it will not only be conducive to implementing the construction policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, but also have a significant promoting effect on solving other problems, especially for eliminating officialdom and lethargy, which is an indispensable move.

　　在国家机关中反掉一切浪费现象
　　本报评论员
    当“反对浪费勤俭建国”成为全国人民的行动口号的时候，国家机关和事业单位应该把反对浪费作为深入整改阶段的主要内容之一，烧起一把烈火，烧掉机关中的一切铺张浪费现象，打掉官风和暮气。
    最近，中央国家机关整改进度较快的一些单位展开了反浪费斗争，在短短几天中就揭发了大量的令人触目惊心的浪费现象。据轻工业部造纸设计院初步揭发，在最近几年新建和扩建的十七个工程项目中，浪费竟达三千九百多万元。在各个经济部门中，由于计划、设计以及物资调拨等工作中的缺点而造成的浪费现象是十分严重的。同样，在一般人的印象中似乎是“清水衙门”的文化部门，也大量地揭发了令人不能容忍的浪费现象。文化部所属的艺术事业单位中，铺张浪费，竞赛豪华的风气十分严重。在服装、道具、布景上大量挥霍国家资金毫不痛惜。排一个戏，服装道具费用动辄上万元。印刷出版事业中的浪费现象也十分严重，仅新华书店北京发行所最近三年来，由于书籍降价、报废所造成的损失就达一百八十多万元。在国家机关中，人力的浪费也是惊人的。以文化部所属的艺术事业单位来说，演员长期不演戏，导演长期不排戏，已是司空见惯的事情。据揭发，中央实验歌剧院有一个演员去年一年仅仅在电台上作过一分二十一秒钟的广播，一个导演七八年中拿了三万多元工薪，却常常借口剧本不好而没有排一部电影。好多名演员一年只演出十几场或几十场戏。据文化部负责人估计，经过这次揭发，在已经下放的基础上，还可以再继续紧缩和下放15％左右的干部。仅仅这几个机关的例子已经可以说明，在国家机关中反浪费决不是没有什么可搞，而是大有可为。
    在国家机关中反浪费，不仅有极大的经济意义，在政治上思想上的作用尤其巨大。不反浪费，勤俭建国，勤俭办一切事业就不可能成为国家机关的行动指针；不反浪费，就不能彻底打掉官风和暮气，就不能革新机关风气，就不能鼓起革命干劲；不反浪费，资产阶级思想就还不容易受到深刻的揭发和批判。
    造成这样严重的浪费现象的原因是多方面的。从轻工业部和化工部等单位对一些典型设计的分析中看出，部分工程技术人员至今还不懂得我们不仅要求多、快、好，而且要求省，现在还不能完全采用新的技术设备，必须利用一部分落后的技术设备。正因为他们不懂得这个道理，所以盲目地要求一切都是现代化自动化，要求在技术设备方面立即赶上国际水平，不问有无必要，大量要求订购国外设备。轻工业部造纸设计院设计的“79工程”，本来有90％以上的设备可由国内制造，但是，设计中却百分之百地使用进口设备，而且其中有些设备国内制造的质量很好。这项工程中仅盲目购进国外订货，就浪费了一千二百万元。至于讲排场赛豪华的不良习气，在国家机关及所属的事业单位中还严重地存在着。并且还有不少人为这种行为寻找借口，说这是应该具有的国家气魄和国际水平。这些同志完全忘记了从我们国家的实际情况出发，不懂得在我们这样一个又穷又白又大的国家中，所谓国家气魄只能是克勤克俭、艰苦奋斗，而决不是豪华奢侈。讲排场比阔气是败家子、破落户的没落衰败气象，决不是建设者兴家立业、蓬勃向上的兴旺气象。
    许多浪费现象由官风而来，许多浪费现象又助长了官风暮气的蔓延。很多浪费现象是那样明显那样严重，为什么负责干部长期不知道？为什么有些单位不贯彻正确的业务方针，而领导方面竟毫不察觉？这不能不归咎于这些部门的领导人员的不了解下情，不亲自动手处理问题的官僚主义作风。化工部和轻工业部在揭发设计工作中的严重浪费的时候，发现有些重要的工程设计，部和设计院里的领导同志平时既很少过问，设计完毕又不亲自动手进行审查，而只是听听下边干部的汇报，就通过了事。确实有不少领导同志不重视政治思想工作，容忍资产阶级思想在工作人员中间泛滥，放弃工人阶级思想阵地，特别是对少数著名的技术人员、艺术工作者迁就过多，放弃了必要的政治思想教育。
    应该指出，浪费现象大多扎根在资产阶级思想基础上，同时，又为资产阶级思想的滋长准备了有利的气候和土壤。资产阶级的设计观点、资产阶级的艺术观点、资产阶级的经营管理思想对我们国家机关和企业、事业单位腐蚀的结果，不但造成了大量的浪费，而且增加了国家机关同企业、事业单位同劳动人民之间的距离。文化部所属的中央实验歌剧院因为追求豪华的服装、布景、道具，到外地演出，仅运服装、布景等就需要两三个火车车皮。这样浩浩荡荡的队伍，不但下不了工厂、农村，也下不了中小城市。资产阶级的本位主义思想和个人主义思想，使得有些同志，到处争干部、争物资、争设备。有的艺术团体人员，养尊处优，过着资产阶级的生活，连技巧也退步了。有一个京剧名演员因为平常很少演出，又不勤练功夫，过去一连翻上几十个跟斗而面不改色，现在则翻上几个跟斗就汗流满面。当全国人民正在鼓起革命干劲准备苦战三年向前跃进的时候，我们的一些国家机关工作人员、艺术工作者却暮气沉沉，娇惰一至于此，这还不足以促起我们立即猛醒吗？现在，我们应该通过反浪费斗争，具体地大量地揭露资产阶级思想给我们建设事业的危害，并且明确地树立勤俭建国勤俭办一切事业的思想，这就有可能更加有效地增强人们对于资产阶级思想的抵抗力和免疫性。
    为了彻底地反掉一切浪费现象，要组织群众反复进行辩论。有些单位提出要在“经济上算账，思想上挖根”，这就是通过辩论弄清问题的性质，挖出思想根源，找出克服浪费、堵塞漏洞的办法，制定增产节约和改进有关方面工作的方案。在组织辩论中，要善于组织各种不同意见的争论，特别注意给那些有错误认识但一时还没有弄通思想的同志们以发言的机会，否则就不能解决他们的思想问题，也不容易使大家真正分清正确的和错误的思想界限。进行辩论最好广泛地吸收基层单位及有关方面的同志参加，以便把问题辩深辩透。群众一经发动起来，必然会揭发出大量的浪费现象，当然不可能一一进行辩论。这就要求领导方面找出本机关浪费的主要方面，同时，从中选取典型的问题进行辩论。典型问题辩论清楚了，举一反三，其他类似问题也就容易解决了。
    深入整改中需要解决的问题很多，但是，一定要抓紧反对浪费这一重要环节。这一个环节抓住了，问题解决了，不但有利于贯彻勤俭建国的建设方针，对于解决其他问题也有重大的推动作用，特别是对于打掉官风暮气，这是不可缺少的一举。
