I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai’s speech on “The Current International Situation and China’s Foreign Policy,” Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s “Report on the Implementation of the 1957 Budget and the 1958 National Budget,” Vice Premier Bo Yibo’s “Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1958,” Vice Chairman Peng Zhen’s “Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress,” and Director Wu Yuzhang’s “Report on the Current Work of Language Reform and the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme.”

Now, I would like to talk about the development of China's aquatic industry during the First Five-Year Plan and my opinions on future work. I welcome criticism and corrections from all delegates.

(I)

Last year's aquatic production was nearly three million tons, more than double the highest pre-war annual output.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, China's aquatic industry achieved great success under the correct leadership of the Party and the government. In 1957, the national aquatic output reached 2.95 million tons, an increase of 78 percent over 1952, and double the highest pre-war historical annual output, exceeding the target set by the state in the First Five-Year Plan. On average, the annual increase was 260,000 tons, a rate of growth rarely seen in the world. At present, the socialist transformation of the ownership of fishing production materials has been basically completed, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of fishermen for production is unprecedentedly high, greatly promoting the development of the aquatic industry. During this period, the number of state-owned fishing motorized vessels increased from 189 to 412, more than doubling; aquaculture enterprises also saw some development. Due to the development of production, on the one hand, the income of fishermen has greatly increased; on the other hand, market supply has been expanded, with the national per capita consumption increasing from six jin in 1952 to nine jin; exports have increased, earning foreign exchange for the country and supporting national industrial construction, such as exporting one ton of prawns in exchange for six tons of steel, and one ton of dried shrimp in exchange for nine and a half tons of steel. At the same time, the organized fishermen actively engaged in production activities in the ocean, coordinating with the heroic navy, and also played a certain role in consolidating coastal defense. In addition, with the development of the aquatic industry, we have also established some aquatic scientific institutions and cultivated some technical personnel, creating conditions for the future development of the aquatic industry.

(II)

Aquatic resources are very rich with great potential. Strive to reach 4 million tons in output this year and 10 million tons in 1962.

Fellow delegates: China's First Five-Year Plan has been successfully completed. Now, the Party Central Committee calls on the people of the whole country to strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer. This great call has set off a high tide of production leap forward among the people of the whole country. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, China's aquatic production will also have a great leap forward. In 1962, aquatic production will reach 8 million tons and strive to reach 10 million tons, an increase of 5.05 to 7.05 million tons over 1957, an increase of 171 to 239 percent. Calculated at 8 million tons, the national per capita consumption will increase from nine jin to twenty-three jin. In 1958, the guaranteed completion of aquatic production is 3.52 million tons, and strive to complete 4.05 million tons, an increase of 570,000 to 1.1 million tons over 1957, an increase of 19 to 37 percent.

In 1956, the total global aquatic production was 29 million tons. The output of several major fishing countries was: Japan 4.76 million tons, the United States 2.93 million tons, the Soviet Union 2.74 million tons, and our China 2.64 million tons. By 1962, if China's aquatic production can reach 8 million tons, it will rank first in the world in terms of total output.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the development speed of China's aquatic production will be very fast. Judging from China's aquatic resource conditions and the enthusiasm of the masses for production after agricultural and fishery cooperation, the realization of this plan is entirely possible.

China's aquatic resources are rich and the potential is enormous. The total freshwater area (including rivers, lakes, ponds, etc.) in the country is estimated to be more than 160 million mu, of which more than 60 million mu is available for aquaculture. At present, only 15 million mu of water surface has been utilized, accounting for only one-quarter of the cultivatable area. That is to say, there are more than 40 million mu of water surface that has not been cultivated. With the development of national water conservancy construction, more and more reservoirs, ponds, and ditches are constantly appearing, and these water surfaces can be used for aquaculture. In addition, we also have rice fields in most parts of the country, which can also be used for fish farming. However, at present, only more than 3 million mu of rice fields are used for fish farming. Currently, the average freshwater aquaculture production in the country is 60 jin per mu, while some cooperatives in various provinces have already reached 1,000 to 2,000 jin, or even 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu. These facts show that even the already cultivated water surfaces still have great potential. Some water surfaces, such as salt farm storage ponds and factory wastewater ponds, were previously considered unsuitable for fish farming, but recent trials have proven that they can still be cultivated.

In terms of marine aquaculture, China has approximately 7 million mu of shallow sea tidal flats and bays available for aquaculture. However, only 900,000 mu have been utilized, accounting for 13 percent of the cultivatable area, and there are still 6.1 million mu of water surface that has not been cultivated. From the perspective of the unit yield of marine aquaculture, the national average is 250 jin per mu, while some cooperatives in various provinces have reached 4,000 to 5,000 jin, or even 7,000 to 8,000 jin per mu. This also shows that the already cultivated seawater water surfaces also have great potential.

In terms of marine fishing, China's marine fishing grounds are vast and require our efforts to develop. However, some fishing grounds (such as the South China Sea and the East China Sea) have not yet been well utilized, and some individual fishing grounds that were abandoned in the past have not been restored in time. We must gradually utilize and restore them.

At present, China's aquatic production still relies mainly on manpower and manual tools. Under the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, the current demand for large-scale development of state-owned fishing vessels is limited. Because, China not only has more than 4 million hardworking and brave professional fishermen, but also hundreds of millions of working farmers who take fishing as their sideline, and their strength is endless. Moreover, after cooperation, the ability of fishery production cooperatives to expand reproduction has greatly increased compared to the past. The manpower, materials, and financial resources of the cooperatives can be unified and rationally used under the leadership of the Party. As long as we are good at mobilizing various positive factors, the prospect of aquatic production development is unlimited.

(III)

Measures for a Great Leap Forward in Aquatic Production

In order to complete and strive to overfulfill the production plans listed above, we believe that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the policy of aquatic production should be: Mobilize all positive factors, further rely on cooperatives, let go and mobilize the broad masses of fishermen and farmers, universally develop freshwater aquaculture and marine aquaculture; fully utilize and restore old fishing grounds, actively open up new fishing grounds, rationally utilize aquatic resources, increase the catch of state-owned production enterprises and cooperatives, and strive for a great leap forward in aquatic production.

In order to implement this policy, there are the following measures:

Utilize all available water surfaces for aquaculture.

Expanding rice paddy aquaculture area has a very considerable output.

First, actively develop freshwater and marine aquaculture, and fully utilize all available water surfaces; at the same time, gradually increase the yield per unit area.

In 1962, the national freshwater aquaculture area is planned to expand to 50 million mu, an increase of two to three times compared to 1957. In 1958, the plan is to expand to 30 million mu, an expansion of one time compared to 1957. In 1962, the average yield per mu will reach 150 jin, an increase of one and a half times compared to 1957. This requirement is not very high and is entirely achievable.

In expanding freshwater aquaculture, various regions have already made considerable efforts. For example, Xinxiang Prefecture in Henan Province did not have the habit of raising or eating fish in the past. However, under the leadership of the local Party and government, after one year of effort in 1956, the fish farming industry has been developed. In 1957, the 20-mu pond of Hongfulou in Qinyang County achieved a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. Another example is that Tanggu New Port in Hebei Province used salt farm storage ponds and salt transportation canals to raise mullet and prawns, producing 2.26 million jin in 1957. Fengfeng Vegetable Farm in Hebei Province used the wastewater from the Fengfeng Mining Area power plant to cool the generators and raise grass carp and silver carp, with an average yield of 1,500 jin per mu.

In terms of increasing the yield per unit area, various regions have also created many high-yield records. At present, the unit yield of 1.5 million mu of water surface in the country has exceeded 300 jin. Anxin County in Hebei Province used flowing ditches to raise fish, with a yield of 3,660 jin per mu in 1957. Shunde County in Guangdong Province used ponds to raise fish, with a maximum yield of 1,434 jin per mu.

In addition, expanding the use of rice fields for fish farming is also an important measure to expand aquaculture. If the area of rice fields used for fish farming in the country can reach 5 percent of the total area of rice fields, with a yield of only 15 jin per mu, the national annual output is also very considerable. Jishou County in Hunan Province used rice fields for fish farming, with a yield of 70 jin per mu, far exceeding 4.5 times the current average yield per unit area. It can be seen that the hope for rice field fish farming is also very high.

In 1962, the seawater aquaculture area is planned to expand to 3.1 million mu, an expansion of 2.5 times compared to 1957, and the planned yield per mu is 640 jin, an increase of 1.5 times compared to 1957. This requirement is also entirely possible to achieve. At present, the average yield per mu of seawater aquaculture in Zhejiang Province has reached 450 jin, and Fujian has reached 500 jin. In individual areas, such as the 80-mu water surface of the Dawo Fishery Cooperative in Lianjiang County, the yield per mu has reached as high as 8,300 jin for clam cultivation. There are many types of marine aquaculture, including sea cucumbers, fish, shellfish, and algae. Among algae, the reproduction of kelp is particularly worth mentioning here. For many years, people have always believed that kelp is a low-temperature aquatic plant that cannot grow in our country. Now, we have not only established kelp farming bases in Dalian and Qingdao, but also successfully tested farming in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. This kind of thing that was unimaginable during the Kuomintang rule before liberation has now become a reality. In 1957, our kelp production was already 12,000 tons of fresh goods, and 60 fishery cooperatives have learned kelp farming. This year, we plan to vigorously promote kelp transplantation in coastal provinces, and the output will have a leap-forward growth. In 1962, it is planned to produce 400,000 tons of fresh kelp, an increase of 32 times compared to 1957. By that time, the people in the mountainous areas of our country will all be able to eat kelp.

The above situation fully shows that as long as we boost our efforts, actively utilize all seawater and freshwater for aquaculture, and increase the yield per unit area, aquaculture will definitely be able to make a great leap forward during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

In order to increase the yield per unit area of aquatic aquaculture and develop aquatic production, in terms of freshwater aquaculture, we must also take technical measures such as increasing the survival rate of fish fry, clearing ponds and preparing ponds, mixed dense stocking, intensive farming and meticulous feeding, and preventing and controlling fish diseases; in terms of seawater aquaculture, we must also take technical measures such as selecting good varieties, improving the bottom quality, intensive farming and meticulous breeding, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases. In recent years, various regions have also created many advanced experiences in improving aquaculture technology, and have achieved great achievements in strengthening production. For example, the Dalian Aquaculture Farm adopted the measure of inverting kelp ropes, so that kelp is universally exposed to light, and the yield per mu increased by 67 percent. In 1957, the Qinlao Fishery Cooperative in Wuxing County, Zhejiang, adopted the measure of digging deeper pond bottoms, and the yield per mu also increased by 1.5 times. This shows that as long as we cherish the experiences created by the broad masses and promote them, the planned unit yield indicators for 1962 can certainly be greatly exceeded.

Expand new fishing grounds and rationally utilize aquatic resources.

Improve technology, build more motorized sailing ships, and increase the catch.

Second, expand new fishing grounds, rationally utilize aquatic resources, take various effective technical measures, increase marine fishing output, and gradually realize the motorization of fishing boats.

China's marine fishing potential is huge and has broad prospects for development. Taking Zhejiang Province alone, the fishing ground area is as large as 54,500 square nautical miles, but at present, the area where the province's fishing boats operate only accounts for one-third of the fishing ground area. Therefore, in the future, in addition to planned restoration of fishing grounds that were abandoned in the past, we should also actively open up new fishing grounds.

In order to protect aquatic resources, we should actively implement the "Resource Protection Measures" promulgated by various regions; especially to protect the spawning of parent fish and the growth of juvenile fish.

Improving technology is an important means to increase fishing output at present. In this regard, we should give full play to the potential of existing production tools and improve them; we should carry out multiple fishing gear operation and rotation, and implement active year-round operation, in order to change the past passive operating situation of "relying on one season a year, and one season relying on one tide." We should also actively increase the catch of middle and upper layer fish. In recent years, the broad masses have also achieved great results in fishing technology. For example, Putuo County in Zhejiang Province increased the annual unit yield by 70 percent compared to 1956 due to the improvement of fishing gear in 1957, and greatly reduced the damage rate of juvenile fish. Rizhao County in Shandong Province promoted multiple operations and extended operation time in 1957, increasing the output by 60 percent compared to 1956. The Wantong Fishery Cooperative in Honghu County, Hubei Province, increased its output by two times in the first quarter of 1957 compared to the same period in 1956 due to the implementation of multiple operations.

In recent years, coastal fishermen have added more than 900 motorized sailing ships, thereby greatly increasing output. For example, Zhejiang Province promoted 124 pairs of motorized sailing ships, and the output of one pair of motorized sailing ships is 4.5 times higher than that of one pair of wooden sailing ships. Encouraged by the National Agricultural Development Program, the vast majority of fishermen in the province now believe that motorized sailing ships have great power and high output, and they are willing to save money and resources to build motorized sailing ships. We should be encouraged and supported by the enthusiasm of the broad masses of fishermen to improve technology and increase production. Therefore, in areas with the necessary conditions, we should use various methods to help fishermen realize the motorization of fishing boats.

State-owned fishing vessel production should be actively consolidated and improved. In particular, it should give full play to its advanced demonstration role in fishing technology. At the same time, new ships should be appropriately increased according to the possibilities and specific conditions.

Summarize and promote advanced experiences in aquaculture and fishing.

Make the backward catch up with the advanced and make the advanced more advanced.

Third, as mentioned earlier, various regions have created and accumulated many advanced experiences in aquaculture and fishing. Summarizing and promoting these advanced experiences, so that backward units can quickly catch up with the advanced, and the advanced units become more advanced, is an extremely important organizational measure. According to existing experience, mobilize cadres to participate in production personally, engage in experimental ponds, experimental farms, and experimental ships; run training classes for key members, hold meetings of advanced workers; organize representatives from various regions to visit the site; and promote the signing of package teaching and learning contracts between regions, etc., are all effective methods to summarize and promote advanced experiences. As long as we do a good job in this area, we will definitely be able to complete or overfulfill the aquatic production plan from 1958 to 1962.

Fellow delegates! 1957 was a great and extraordinary year. In this year, after the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has achieved a great victory. The anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy activities of the bourgeois rightists have been completely crushed. The people of the whole country are more closely united around the Party, and the political awareness and enthusiasm of the broad masses of people to serve the cause of socialist construction have been further enhanced. Now, a new upsurge of a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production is coming in overwhelmingly. Under such a new situation, the staff and workers of the national aquatic departments should, under the leadership of the Party and government in various regions, closely rely on the masses, make a grand advance to the rivers, lakes, reservoirs, oceans, ponds, and all utilizable water surfaces, run the cooperatives diligently and thriftily, appropriately expand public accumulation, strive to learn advanced experiences, improve technology, and ensure the completion and strive for the overfulfillment of the 1958 aquatic production plan.

Finally, the relevant departments have given great support to our work in the past. In particular, our heroic People's Navy has given us great help in protecting the safety of marine fishermen's production. On behalf of the fishermen and the staff and workers of the national aquatic departments, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks!

    向江、河、湖、海、塘全面进军
    争取五年内水产总产量跃居世界首位
    水产部部长许德珩的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理所作的“目前国际形势和我国外交政策”的讲话、李先念副总理“关于一九五七年预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算的报告”、薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”、彭真副委员长“关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”以及吴玉章主任“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”。
    现在，我来谈谈我国水产事业第一个五年计划期间的发展情况和今后工作的意见。请各位代表批评、指正。
    （一）
    去年水产产量近三百万吨  比战前最高年产量多一倍
    第一个五年计划期间，我国水产事业，在党和政府的正确领导下，获得了很大的成绩。一九五七年，全国水产产量已经达到了二百九十五万吨，比一九五二年增加百分之七十八，比战前历史上最高年产量增加了一倍。超额完成了第一个五年计划中国家所规定的任务。五年内平均，每年增长二十六万吨，这种增长量，在世界上是少见的。目前，渔业生产资料所有制的社会主义改造已经基本完成，广大渔民的生产积极性空前高涨，大大的促进了水产事业的发展。这一期间，国营捕捞机轮由一百八十九艘增加到四百一十二艘，增加了一倍多；养殖企业也有了一定的发展。由于生产的发展，一方面，渔民的收入有了很大的增加；另一方面，扩大了市场供应，由一九五二年全国每人平均消费量的六斤提高到九斤；增加出口，为国家换取外汇，支援了国家的工业建设，如出口一吨对虾可换回六吨钢材，一吨虾米可换回九吨半钢材；同时，组织起来了的渔民积极在海洋进行生产活动，配合英勇的海军，对巩固海防，也起了一定的作用。另外，随着水产事业的发展，我们还建立了一些水产科学机构，培养出一些技术力量，为今后水产事业的发展创造了条件。
    （二）
    水产资源很丰富潜力很大  今年争取产量达四百万吨  1962年争取达到一千万吨
    各位代表：我国第一个五年计划已经胜利的完成了。现在，党中央号召全国人民争取在十五年或者更多一点时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品产量方面赶上或者超过英国。这个伟大的号召已经在全国人民中间掀起了一个生产大跃进的高潮。随着工农业生产的大跃进，我国水产生产也将有一个大跃进。一九六二年水产产量将完成八百万吨，争取达到一千万吨，比一九五七年增加五百零五到七百零五万吨，即增加百分之一百七十一至二百三十九。按八百万吨计算，全国每人平均消费量将由九斤提高到二十三斤。一九五八年水产产量保证完成三百五十二万吨，争取完成四百零五万吨，比一九五七年增加五十七到一百一十万吨，即增加百分之十九到百分之三十七。
    一九五六年，全世界水产总产量共二千九百万吨，几个主要渔产国家的产量是：日本四百七十六万吨，美国二百九十三万吨，苏联二百七十四万吨，我们中国二百六十四万吨。到一九六二年，我国水产产量如果能够达到八百万吨，就将在总产量方面跃居世界第一位。
    第二个五年计划期间，我国水产生产发展的速度是很快的，从我国水产的资源条件和农业、渔业合作化以后群众生产的积极性来看，这个计划的实现是完全可能的。
    我国的水产资源丰富，潜力极大，全国淡水水面（包括江、河、湖泊、池塘等）约计共有一亿六千多万亩，其中可供养殖的水面有六千多万亩，目前已经利用了的水面还只有一千五百万亩，仅占可养殖水面的四分之一，这就是说，还有四千多万亩的水面没有养殖。随着全国水利建设的开展，不断的出现更多的水库、塘堰、沟渠，这些水面都可以进行养殖。此外，我们还有全国大部分地区的水稻田，也可以养鱼，可是，现在利用养鱼的稻田，还只有三百多万亩。目前，全国淡水养殖，平均每亩生产六十斤，而各省都有一些合作社每亩产量已经达到一、二千斤，甚至三、四千斤。这些事实说明，就是已经养殖的水面，也还是有很大的潜力的。还有一些水面如盐场贮水池、工厂废水池等，过去都认为是不能养鱼的，最近经过试养证明，还是可以养殖的。
    在海水养殖方面，我国可供养殖的浅海滩涂、港湾面积，约有七百万亩。但是目前已经利用的只有九十万亩，占可养殖面积的百分之十三，还有六百一十万亩水面没有养殖。从海水养殖的单位产量来看，全国平均每亩产二百五十斤，而各省也都有一些合作社每亩产量达到四、五千斤，甚至七、八千斤。这也说明了已经养殖的海水水面，也还有很大的潜力的。
    在海洋捕捞方面，我国海洋渔场辽阔广大，需要我们努力发展。但是有些渔场（如南海、东海）我们现在还没有很好地利用，个别过去废弃了的渔场，还没有及时地恢复，我们要逐渐的利用并恢复起来。
    我国当前水产生产，还是依靠人力和依靠手工工具为主，在优先发展重工业的方针下，目前要求大量发展国营渔轮，是有限度的。因为，我国不仅有四百多万勤劳勇敢的专业渔民，同时还有数以亿计的以渔业为其副业的劳动农民，他们的力量是无穷无尽的。而且合作化了以后，渔业生产合作社扩大再生产能力，比过去大大提高，合作社的人力、物力和财力在党的领导下，可以统一安排，合理使用。只要我们善于调动各种积极因素，水产生产发展的前途，是不可限量的。
    （三）
    水产大跃进的措施
    为了完成并争取超额完成上面所列的生产计划，我们认为，在第二个五年计划期间，水产生产的方针应该是：调动一切积极因素，进一步地依靠合作社，放手发动广大渔民和农民群众，普遍地开展淡水养殖和海水养殖；充分利用并恢复旧有渔场，积极开辟新的渔场，合理地利用水产资源，提高国营生产企业和合作社的捕获量，力争水产生产的大跃进。
    为了贯彻执行这一方针，有以下的几项措施：
    利用一切可利用的水面进行养殖
    扩大稻田养殖面积产量非常可观
    第一、积极发展淡水和海水养殖，把一切可以利用的水面充分地利用起来；同时，逐步提高单位面积产量。
    一九六二年全国淡水养殖面积计划扩大到五千万亩，比一九五七年增加两倍到三倍，一九五八年计划扩大到三千万亩，比一九五七年扩大一倍；一九六二年平均每亩产量达到一百五十斤，比一九五七年提高一倍半。这个要求并不很高，是完全可以实现的。
    在扩大淡水养殖方面，各地已经作了不少的努力，如河南新乡专区，过去没有养鱼和吃鱼的习惯，但是，在当地党政的领导下，经过一九五六年一年的努力，养鱼事业已经开展起来了，沁阳县宏福楼二十亩坑塘，一九五七年每亩产量即达一千斤以上。又如河北省塘沽新港利用盐场贮水池、运盐渠放养鮻鱼、对虾，一九五七年就生产了二百二十六万斤。河北省峰峰蔬菜农场，利用峰峰矿区发电厂冷却发电机的废水放养草鱼、花白鲢鱼，平均每亩产量也达到了一千五百斤。
    在提高单位面积产量方面，各地也已经创造了不少的丰产纪录。现在全国已经有一百五十万亩水面的单位产量超过了三百斤。河北省安新县利用流水濠沟养鱼，一九五七年每亩产量高达三千六百六十斤。广东顺德县利用池塘养鱼，最高每亩产量达到一千四百三十四斤。
    此外，扩大利用稻田养鱼，也是一项扩大养殖的重要措施，全国稻田养鱼面积，如果能够达到全国稻田总面积的百分之五，每亩产量仅以十五斤计，全国一年的产量也是很可观的。湖南省吉首县利用稻田养鱼，每亩产量高达七十斤，远远超过目前平均单位面积产量的四倍半，可见稻田养鱼的希望也是很大的。
    一九六二年海水养殖面积，计划扩大到三百一十万亩，比一九五七年扩大二倍半，每亩产量计划达到六百四十斤，比一九五七年提高一倍半。这个要求也是完全可能实现的。目前，浙江全省海水养殖，每亩平均产量已经达到四百五十斤，福建已经达到五百斤，个别地区如连江县大沃渔业社养蛏八十亩水面，每亩产量已经高达八千三百多斤。海水养殖的种类很多，有海参、鱼类、贝类、藻类；藻类之中值得我们在这里特别提出的，是海带的繁殖。多少年来，人们一直认为海带是低温的水生植物，我国不能生长。现在我们不仅在旅大和青岛建立了养殖海带的基地，而且在浙江、福建、广东已经试养成功；这种在解放前国民党统治时代想像不到的事情，现在已经成为现实了。一九五七年我们海带的生产已经有一万二千吨鲜货，并且有了六十个渔业合作社学会了海带养殖；今年，我们计划在沿海各省大力推广海带移殖，产量将有跃进式的增长。一九六二年，计划生产鲜海带四十万吨，比一九五七年增长三十二倍。这样到了那个时候，我国山区人民就都可以吃到海带了。
    以上情况充分说明，只要我们鼓起干劲，积极利用一切海水、淡水进行养殖，提高单位面积产量，在第二个五年计划期间，养殖事业肯定是可以大大地跃进的。
    为了提高水产养殖的单位面积产量，发展水产生产，在淡水养殖方面，我们还必须采取提高鱼苗的成活率、清塘整池、混合密养、精养细喂、防治鱼病等技术措施；在海水养殖方面，我们还必须采取选择良种、改良底质、精养细殖、防治病虫害等技术措施。几年来，在改进养殖技术方面，各地也创造了不少的先进经验，在加强生产方面，取得了巨大的成就。如旅大养殖场采取了海带倒绳的措施，使海带普遍受光，每亩产量提高了百分之六十七。浙江吴兴县勤劳渔业社，一九五七年采用挑深塘底的措施，每亩产量也提高了一倍半。由此可见，只要我们珍视广大群众创造出来的经验，加以推广，一九六二年预定的单位产量指标，是一定可以大大地超过。
    扩大新渔场并合理利用水产资源
    改进技术增建机帆船提高捕捞量
    第二、扩大新渔场，合理地利用水产资源，采取各种有效的技术措施，提高海洋捕捞产量，逐步实现渔船的动力化。
    我国海洋捕捞潜力很大，它有广阔的发展前途。单就浙江一省来看，渔场面积广达五万四千五百平方浬，可是目前该省渔船作业的地区，还只占渔场面积的三分之一。因此，今后除了有计划地恢复过去废弃的渔场以外，还应该积极地开拓新的渔场。
    为了保护水产资源，应该积极贯彻执行各地公布的“资源保护办法”；特别是保护亲鱼产卵和幼鱼的成长。
    改进技术，是目前提高捕捞产量的重要手段。在这方面，我们应该发挥现有生产工具的潜力并加以改进；应该开展多种渔具兼作和轮作，实行积极地常年作业，以改变过去“一年靠一季，一季靠一汛”消极的作业情况，还应该积极地提高中上层鱼类的捕获量。几年来，在捕捞技术方面，广大群众也取得了很大的成绩。例如浙江普陀县，一九五七年由于改进网具，使全年单位产量比一九五六年增加了百分之七十，而且大大地降低了幼鱼的损害率。山东日照县，一九五七年推广多种作业和延长作业时间，使当年产量比一九五六年增产了百分之六十。湖北洪湖县万同渔业社，由于推行了多种作业，一九五七年第一季度产量比一九五六年同期增加了两倍。
    几年来，沿海渔民添置了九百多艘机帆船，从而大大地增加了产量。如浙江省推广机帆船一百二十四对，一对机帆船的产量比一对木帆船高达四倍半。在全国农业发展纲要的鼓舞之下，现在该省广大渔民，都认为机帆船的力量大、产量高，表示宁愿省吃俭用，也要造机帆船。广大渔民这种改进技术，增加生产的热情，使我们鼓舞，是应该加以支持的。因此，今后在条件具备的地区，应该运用各种方法，帮助渔民实现渔船的动力化。
    国营渔轮生产，应积极巩固提高，特别在捕捞技术上应当充分发挥先进示范作用，同时根据可能与具体条件适当的增加新船。
    总结和推广养殖和捕捞先进经验
    使落后的赶上先进使先进更先进
    第三、如前所述，在养殖和捕捞方面，各地都创造并积累了不少的先进经验。总结和推广这些先进经验，使落后的单位迅速赶上先进，使先进的单位更加先进，是一项极其重要的组织措施。根据现有的经验，发动干部亲自参加生产，搞试验塘、试验场、试验船；开办骨干分子训练班，召开先进工作者会议；组织各地代表到现场参观；提倡地区之间订立包教包学合同等等，都是总结和推广先进经验的有效方法，只要我们做好这一方面的工作，就一定可以完成或者超额完成一九五八年到一九六二年的水产生产计划的。
    各位代表！一九五七年是一个伟大的不平凡的一年。在这一年中，经过了全民整风和反右派斗争，在政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义革命已经取得了巨大的胜利，资产阶级右派分子反党、反社会主义的阴谋活动，已经彻底地被粉碎了，全国人民更加紧密地团结在党的周围，广大人民的政治觉悟和为社会主义建设事业服务的积极性更加提高。现在，一个新的工、农业生产大跃进的高潮排山倒海地到来，在这样一个新的形势之下，全国水产部门的职工应在各地党、政领导之下，紧紧地依靠群众，向江、河、湖泊、海洋、塘堰一切可以利用的水面大进军，勤俭办社，适当扩大公共积累，努力学习先进经验，提高技术，保证完成和争取超额完成一九五八年度水产生产计划。
    最后，各有关部门过去对我们的工作给予了很大的支持，特别是我们英勇的人民海军，在保护海上渔民生产安全方面，给了我们很大的帮助。我谨代表全国渔民和全国水产部门的职工，表示衷心的感谢！
