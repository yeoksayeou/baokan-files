Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th: The people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam celebrated their fourth Spring Festival since the restoration of peace on the 18th. The Vietnamese people feel that each Spring Festival is better than the last.

The biggest feature of this year's Spring Festival is the very stable prices and ample New Year goods. There was no queuing and panic buying before the festival. Under the care of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, every family was able to have meat for the Spring Festival. The laboring people are generally excited about the stable prices during the Spring Festival.

The citizens of Hanoi responded to President Ho Chi Minh's call to "celebrate the Spring Festival thriftily" with practical actions from all aspects. On the basis of ensuring a happy Spring Festival, the festival expenses of cadres in various organs were generally reduced by one-third to more than half of the original plan.

Two good rains fell before the Spring Festival, bringing new joy to the people in the drought-stricken areas. In order to strive for an early and complete victory in the fight against drought, cadres and people in the drought-stricken areas are ready to go to the fields on the second or third day of the Spring Festival to carry out drought relief work and replanting.

President Ho Chi Minh, who had just returned from Myanmar on the 17th, along with other national leaders, went to various places on the 18th to extend greetings to the laboring people and the cadres who had gathered in the North from the South.

    据新华社河内18日电　越南民主共和国人民在18日度过了和平恢复以来的第四个春节，越南人民感到，春节一年比一年过得好。
    今年春节的最大特点，是物价非常平稳，年货充足，节前没有排队抢购的现象。在河内市行政委员会的关怀下，春节做到了家家有肉吃。劳动人民普遍为春节物价的平稳表示振奋。
    河内市民以实际行动，从各个方面响应了胡志明主席“节约过春节”的号召。在保证愉快过春节的基础上，各机关干部的过节支出普遍从原计划数目节省了三分之一到一半以上。
    春节前下了两场好雨，为旱区人民带来了新的喜悦。为了争取抗旱斗争的早日全胜，旱区干部和民众已经准备在春节的第二天或者第三天下地作抗旱工作和补种。
    17日刚从缅甸回来的胡志明主席同其他国家领导人，18日到各地慰问了劳动人民和从南方集结到北方的干部。
