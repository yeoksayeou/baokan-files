　　今年春夏秋冬四季
    都要举行全国性田径运动会
    新华社31日讯  1958年全国春季田径运动会决定2月23日到25日在广州举行。这是今年对我国田径运动水平的第一次检阅。
    各地参加这次运动会的男女田径选手，成绩必须达到二级运动员或二级运动员以上的水平。女子跳高世界纪录保持者郑凤荣和今年第一个打破全国纪录的中国人民解放军的长跑选手黄志勇（五千公尺）等人，都将参加这次运动会。
    这次运动会将只分男女两组，不像去年全国田径运动会再分甲、乙组。运动会上除男子一千五百公尺异程接力、三千公尺、马拉松和女子一千公尺异程接力等项目外，男女两组共将举行四十项比赛。
    今年的全国夏季田径运动会定6月初在上海举行，11月下旬将在南昌举行全国冬季田径运动会。全国田径通讯比赛，将从5月中旬开始在各地举行。8月中旬和下旬，将在青岛和西安分别举行全国中学生田径运动会和全国大学生田径运动会。此外，解放军系统和全国职工也将分别举行田径比赛。
