Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 1st: The Japanese Commodity Exhibition, following those held in Beijing and Shanghai, opened in Guangzhou on the 1st. Over four thousand people braved the rain to attend the opening ceremony that afternoon.

    Mr. Kumaichi Yamamoto, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and President of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition, said in his opening speech: "The fact that we are able to hold the Japanese Commodity Exhibition here today proves that our Chinese friends have a deep understanding of Japan. I fervently hope that the friendly relations between Japan and China will improve soon." He also said: "The common desire of the more than 600 million Chinese people and the more than 90 million Japanese people is the early restoration of diplomatic relations and peaceful coexistence between the two countries. I believe and expect that this exhibition will fulfill its due responsibility for this great cause."

    Wei Jinfei, Chairman of the Guangzhou Branch of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said at the meeting: We will learn advanced technologies and experiences in Japanese industrial production through the Japanese Commodity Exhibition. Wei Jinfei expressed his conviction that the exhibition would promote the development of trade between China and Japan and enhance the friendship between the people of the two countries.

    Lei Renmin, Vice-Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who came to attend the opening ceremony, also spoke at the meeting. He said: In recent years, trade between China and Japan has developed rapidly due to the joint efforts of our government and the people of China and Japan. However, there are still man-made obstacles on the road to the development of economic and trade relations between Japan and China. U.S. imperialism is doing everything possible to obstruct the normal development of Sino-Japanese trade relations, and the Japanese government is disregarding the wishes and interests of the Japanese people, so that many urgent issues related to the development of trade between the two countries cannot be resolved reasonably. The forced interruption of the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement negotiations fully illustrates this point. Lei Renmin believes that the Japanese people will surely overcome all obstacles and enable the economic and trade relations between China and Japan to develop normally.

    The Japanese Commodity Exhibition is sponsored by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the Japan-China Import and Export Association, and the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, with the assistance of the Guangzhou Branch of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. More than 1,000 Japanese manufacturers and units participated in the exhibition. The exhibition is located in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, which has beautiful scenery, convenient transportation, and magnificent architecture, with an exhibition area of more than 18,000 square meters. The exhibition is divided into eleven pavilions and venues, including textiles, instruments, chemicals, and plastics, exhibiting more than 22,000 items in 49 categories, an increase of approximately 7,000 items compared to the products exhibited in Beijing and Shanghai in previous years. The number of groups from various parts of Japan assisting in the exhibition has also increased from 135 last time to 570 this time. The exhibition has set up a special Friendship Pavilion to display more than 700 gifts, such as toys, handicrafts, and clothing, presented to our country by people from all walks of life in Japan.

    Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai and responsible persons of Chinese people's organizations sent congratulatory telegrams and letters to the exhibition. Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and others also sent congratulatory telegrams to the exhibition.

　　日本商品展览会在广州开幕
    新华社广州1日电　继北京、上海之后在广州举行的日本商品展览会，1日开幕。这天下午有四千多人冒雨参加了展览会的开幕式。
    日本国际贸易促进协会会长、日本商品展览会会长山本熊一在开幕词中说：“今天我们能够在这里举行日本商品展览会，证明中国朋友们对日本有着深刻了解。我热烈地期望日中两国的友好关系早日改善。”他还说：“六亿多的中国人民和九千多万的日本人民的共同愿望，是两国邦交的早日恢复与和平共处，我相信并期待这展览会对这伟大事业能尽到应负的责任。”
    中国国际贸易促进委员会广州分会主任委员魏今非在会上讲话说：我们将通过日本商品展览会来学习日本工业生产方面的先进的技术和经验。魏今非表示确信展览会将促进中日两国贸易事业的发展和增进中日两国人民的友谊。
    前来参加开幕典礼的中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民也在会上讲话。他说：近几年来，中日两国间的贸易，由于我国政府和中日两国人民的共同努力，已经有了迅速的发展。但是，在日本对中国经济贸易关系的发展道路上还存在着人为的障碍。美帝国主义多方阻挠中日贸易关系的正常发展，而日本政府又无视日本人民的意愿和利益，以致有关发展两国间贸易的许多迫切问题都不能获得合理的解决，第四次中日贸易协定谈判的被迫中断，就充分地说明了这一点。雷任民认为，日本人民一定能够战胜一切阻挠，使中日两国间的经济贸易关系正常地发展起来。
    日本商品展览会是日本国际贸易促进协会、日中输出入协会、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟三团体主办的，中国国际贸易促进委员会广州分会协助展出。一千多个日本厂商和单位参加了这次展出。展览会设在风景优美、交通便利和建筑宏伟的中苏友好大厦，展出面积达一万八千多平方公尺。展览会共分纤维、仪器、化学、塑胶等十一个馆、场，展品包括四十九类二万二千多种，较前年在北京、上海展出的产品增加约七千种。日本各地协助展出的团体也由上次的一百三十五个增加到这次的五百七十个。展览会专辟了一个友谊馆，展出七百多件日本各阶层人民赠送给我国的各种玩具、手工艺品、衣物等礼品。
    国务院总理周恩来和我国人民团体负责人，给展览会发去了贺电和贺信。日本政府内阁首相岸信介等也给展览会拍来贺电。
