New Initiative for Commercial Work: "Three Lesses, Two Goods, One Convenience"
Commercial Departments Streamline Management by More Than Half, Improve Service Attitude and Raise Service Quality

    The soaring revolutionary drive of workers and farmers has greatly promoted the enthusiasm of commercial sector employees. Last August, Mayor Peng Zhen proposed the requirements of "fewer management personnel, fewer losses, fewer expenses; better commodity quality, better service attitude; convenience for the masses" to the commercial sector at the first meeting of the Second Municipal People's Committee, which became the action slogan for all commercial employees. The commercial departments first streamlined their management organizations. The city's commercial system had a total of 15,097 management personnel at all levels, of which 7,960 have been streamlined and transferred to lower levels, accounting for 52.73 percent of the original management personnel. In conjunction with streamlining management organizations, a mass movement to improve service attitude and enhance service quality was carried out, achieving very good results. Many stores have shown a new look, some grain stores have taken the initiative to deliver grain to homes, and grocery, department stores and other stores have added a large number of mobile sales carts. Many mobile sales teams in the suburbs carry shovels and picks to water conservancy construction sites to sell goods, and they work together with farmers when they work, and sell goods when farmers rest. This drive has been praised by the peasant brothers.

Tianqiao Department Store Proposes a Revolutionary Initiative: Breaking with Convention and Implementing a One-Shift System to the End

    In the vigorous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the commercial departments organized salespersons to visit the production upsurge of industrial and mining enterprises and the hot and exciting water conservancy construction movement of farmers. The moving deeds inspired the enthusiasm of commercial employees even more. They tried every means to tap their potential and study how to further improve commercial work in order to fully implement the requirements of "Three Lesses, Two Goods, One Convenience." During the rectification movement in October last year, the Tianqiao Department Store concentrated its efforts on solving the problem of poor service attitude. They learned from the advanced experience of Changchun No. 2 Department Store in improving service attitude, formulated nine service stipulations, and after a great debate, resolved some employees' erroneous ideas such as "salespersons are inferior" and "whether you work or not, you get paid at the end of the month anyway," thus setting off a climax of improving service attitude. All the salespersons received customers warmly and kindly, and proactively and patiently introduced commodities, so that 90 percent of the salespersons were praised by customers. However, they were not satisfied with this. After further studying the work situation of salespersons, management fees, and the current working hours system, they believed that commercial departments not only had too many management personnel, but also too many salespersons and business personnel. Salespersons did not have enough work. Employees said: "People are running forward, but some of us are idle and have nothing to do." They believed that this situation was incompatible with our policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. They proposed that the commercial sector must keep pace with the hot and exciting leap forward on the industrial and agricultural production front. They have proposed to the city's commercial sector employees: to break with conventions, change the current eight-hour working day, abolish the two-shift system, and implement a one-shift system to the end, greatly reducing the number of salespersons to support the industrial and agricultural production front, and also proposed that overtime work on holidays can be compensated with leave, and no overtime pay is required. After repeated study and discussion by employees, on the condition that the work should be done more, better, and more conveniently for the masses, the Tianqiao Department Store proposed to reduce 46 people from the existing 101 people, a reduction of 45 percent. The employees also expressed that after streamlining 46 people, the work will be done more and better than in the past; in 1958, not only will expenses be saved by 30,000 yuan compared with 1957, but also the turnover of funds will be accelerated, and the funds occupied will be reduced from an average of 320,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan, a reduction of 120,000 yuan. At present, there are more than 120,000 employees in state-owned, joint state-private owned commercial and service industries in the city. If 30 to 40 percent of the business personnel are drawn out, about 40,000 people can be drawn out to support industrial and agricultural production, which will be a huge force. This is a great promotion for commercial work, promoting commercial departments to improve operation and management, give full play to the enthusiasm and potential of employees, greatly reduce expenses, and increase the accumulation of funds for socialist construction.

    商业工作新倡议　三少两好一便利
    商业部门精简管理人员过半  改进服务态度提高服务质量
    工人、农民高涨的革命干劲，大大地促进了商业部门职工的积极性。去年八月彭真市长在第二届市人民委员会第一次会议上对商业部门提出“管理人员少、损耗少、费用少；商品质量好、服务态度好；便利群众”的要求，成了全体商业职工的行动口号。商业部门首先精简了管理机构。全市商业系统各级管理人员共有一万五千零九十七人，已经精简下放了七千九百六十人，占原有管理人员的百分之五十二点七三。结合着精简管理机构，进行了改进服务态度、提高服务质量的群众性运动，取得了很好的效果。不少的商店出现了新的气象，有的粮食店主动送粮上门，副食、百货等商店增添了大批的流动售货车。郊区不少的流动售货组带着铁锹、洋镐到水利工地去卖货，农民干活时他们也一起干，农民休息时，他们卖货。这种干劲，受到了农民兄弟的交口赞扬。
    天桥百货商场提出了革命倡议  打破常规实行一班顶到底办法
    在轰轰烈烈的工农业生产大跃进中，商业部门组织售货员参观了工矿企业的生产高潮和农民热火朝天的兴修水利运动，动人的事迹把商业部门职工们的干劲鼓得更足了，他们千方百计地挖掘潜力，研究如何进一步地改进商业工作，以全面地贯彻执行“三少两好一便利”的要求。天桥百货商场在去年十月间整风运动中，集中力量解决了服务态度不好的问题，他们学习了长春第二百货商店改进服务态度的先进经验，制订了九项服务条约，经过大辩论，解决了一部分职工的“售货员低人一等”，“干不干，反正到月头也拿钱”等错误思想，因而掀起了改善服务态度的高潮，全体售货员都热情和蔼地接待顾客，主动地耐心地介绍商品，做到百分之九十的售货员都受到顾客的赞扬。但他们并不以此为满足，在进一步地研究了售货员工作情况、管理费以及目前的工时制度以后，认为商业部门不但管理人员过多，售货员和业务人员也多了。售货员们没有足够的工作，职工们说：“人家是跑步向前，我们是有的闲着没事干”，他们认为这种状况是和我们多、快、好、省的建设社会主义的方针不相容的，提出商业部门一定要和工、农业生产战线上的热火热天的大跃进看齐。他们已向全市商业部门的职工提出倡议：要打破常规，改变现行的八小时工作制，取消两班制，实行一班顶到底的办法，大大减少售货员，去支援工农业生产战线，还提出假日加班可以补假，不要加班费。经过职工们反复研究讨论，在工作要作得更多更好更便利群众的条件下，天桥商场提出要从现有的一百零一人中减少四十六人，减少百分之四十五。职工们还表示，精简四十六人后，工作还要比过去做得更多更好；一九五八年不但要比一九五七年节约开支三万元，而且还要加速资金周转，占用资金要从平均三十二万元，压缩到二十万元，减少十二万元。现在，全市国营、公私合营商业和服务业职工共十二万多人，如果抽出百分之三十至百分之四十的业务人员，就可以抽出四万人左右去支援工、农业生产，这将是一个巨大的力量。这对商业工作是一个大促进，促进商业部门改进经营管理，充分发挥职工们的积极性和潜力，大大减少费用开支，更多地增加社会主义建设资金的积累。
