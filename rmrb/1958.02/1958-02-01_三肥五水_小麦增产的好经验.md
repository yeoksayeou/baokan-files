"Three Fertilizations and Five Irrigations" – A Good Experience for Increasing Wheat Production

"Three Fertilizations and Five Irrigations" is a good experience for achieving high wheat yields, accumulated over a long period by farmers.

In 1956, Meng County in Henan Province summarized and vigorously promoted the experience of "Three Fertilizations and Five Irrigations." The county's 320,000 mu of wheat achieved an average yield of 230 jin per mu. In the Goucun Central Township of this county, the 50,000 mu large-area high-yield wheat zone achieved a yield of 400 jin per mu. The "Three Fertilizations" in the Meng County "Three Fertilizations and Five Irrigations" experience are: applying sufficient base fertilizer to the wheat field, topdressing in winter, and topdressing in early spring; the "Five Irrigations" are: base moisture irrigation, winter irrigation, greening-up irrigation, jointing irrigation, and grain-filling irrigation. This experience also includes a series of hoeing and harrowing to conserve moisture in conjunction with irrigation and fertilization.

Why does wheat need "Three Fertilizations and Five Irrigations"? This is determined by the growth characteristics of wheat itself. According to scientific experience, 83% of nitrogen consumption in the entire growth period of wheat occurs before the wheat enters the booting stage. Among them, the nitrogen requirement in the early tillering stage accounts for 12.7% of the total requirement; the peak tillering stage accounts for 34.4%; and the booting stage accounts for 44%. Therefore, applying sufficient base fertilizer before sowing and topdressing in winter and early spring is entirely in line with the growth needs of wheat. In terms of moisture, in the case of autumn drought, "base moisture irrigation" can ensure timely sowing of wheat, good emergence, early rooting, rapid root system development, and more tillering before the new year. Irrigating with "winter water" allows the wheat field to store water and conserve moisture, as well as moderate the ground temperature, reduce frost damage, and protect the safe overwintering of wheat tillering nodes. More than 80% of the water consumption in the life of wheat occurs after the greening-up stage. The jointing stage of wheat is the most important stage of wheat growth and development, and it needs sufficient water and nutrients. Irrigating with "jointing water" is to meet the needs of this period. When wheat is filling grains, it also needs a large amount of water to transport nutrients to the grains. At this time, irrigating with "grain-filling water" can play a role in plumping the grains and strengthening them. As for "greening-up water," it is also very important for wheat to revive, raise its head, and increase effective tillering.

In general, "Three Fertilizations and Five Irrigations" meets the growth needs of wheat. However, in specific applications, it must also be determined according to rainfall, climate, soil quality, and crop growth, etc., and it is not immutable. "Three Fertilizations and Five Irrigations" is essentially an experience of rationally applying water and fertilizer in stages. Under the principle of "Three Fertilizations and Five Irrigations," Meng County farmers flexibly master "watching the sky, watching the land, and watching the crops" to water. They have a flexible approach of "three irrigations, three no irrigations, and two guarantees" for watering. They are doing it correctly. As the situation changes, the specific methods of "Three Fertilizations and Five Irrigations" should also change accordingly.

In the major wheat-producing areas of northern China, wheat spends almost its entire life in a dry and rainless season. Drought has become an important factor limiting wheat growth and development and increasing yields. Artificial irrigation, fertilization, and other measures can make up for the deficiencies of natural conditions and transform low wheat yields into high yields. Many areas with high wheat yields, such as Huang County in Shandong Province, where the average wheat yield in 1956 reached more than 263 jin per mu, Gaocheng County in Hebei Province, which reached 287.5 jin per mu, and Chang'an County in Shaanxi Province, which reached more than 326 jin per mu, as well as many thousand-jin high-yield units, basically conform to the experience of "Three Fertilizations and Five Irrigations" in their wheat field management practices. In the southern wheat-producing areas, topdressing with "winter fertilizer" and "spring fertilizer" basically also conforms to this experience. These areas also have higher yields due to phased fertilization of wheat. For example, in the Songjiang Special Zone of the Taihu Lake area, the 1 million mu of wheat achieved a yield of 200 jin per mu in 1956.

Currently, various localities are actively carrying out wheat field management. According to the specific situation, fully utilizing the experience of "Three Fertilizations and Five Irrigations" can make wheat field management work even better. (Lu Wancheng) (Attached chart)

In the six years from 1949 to 1955, China's wheat acreage expanded by one-quarter, and total output increased by two-thirds; while during the same period, wheat production in the United States and Australia both contracted, and Canada's wheat acreage also decreased by more than one-fifth. The growth rate of wheat yield per unit area in China is also very rapid, second only to Canada, exceeding the United States, Italy, and Australia; however, the production level of yield per unit area is still lower than that of the aforementioned countries, differing from the highest Italy by 1.1 tons per hectare and from the lowest Australia by 0.44 tons per hectare.

These situations show that we still need to make great efforts in wheat production in order to reach the world's highest level of yield per unit area. At the same time, it also shows that as long as we catch up at the speed of these past few years, or even faster, we will definitely be able to reach the world's highest level.

　　“三肥五水”——小麦增产的好经验
    “三肥五水”是农民群众长期积累的小麦丰产的好经验。
    1956年河南省孟县总结和大力推广了“三肥五水”的经验，全县三十二万亩小麦，平均亩产达到二百三十斤。这个县缑村中心乡，五万亩大面丰产区的小麦，亩产量达到四百斤。孟县“三肥五水”的经验中的“三肥”是：麦田施足底肥，冬季追肥，早春追肥；“五水”是：底墒水，冬水，返青水，拔节水，灌浆水。这个经验还包括结合灌溉、施肥进行一系列锄耙保墒等。
    为什么小麦需要“三肥五水”呢？这是小麦本身生长特性所决定的。根据科学经验，在小麦整个生长期里，83％的氮素消耗在小麦孕穗以前。其中分蘖初期需氮量占总需要量的12.7％；分蘖盛期占34.4％；孕穗期占44％。因此，在播种前施足底肥，冬季和早春进行追肥，是完全适合小麦生长需要的。从水分来说，在秋旱情况下，“底墒水”可以保证小麦适时播种，出苗好，盘根早，根系发育快，年前分蘖多。浇灌“冬水”，麦田可以储水蓄墒，也可以缓和地温，减轻冻害，保护小麦分蘖节安全越冬。小麦一生中，有80％以上的水分消耗在小麦返青以后。小麦拔节时期，是小麦生长发育最重要的阶段，更需要有充足的水分和养分，灌“拔节水”就是为了满足这个时期的需要。小麦灌浆的时候，也需要有大量水分输送养分到籽粒中去，这时浇“灌浆水”可以起鼓籽壮粒的作用。至于“返青水”，对于小麦返青抬头、增加有效分蘖，也是很重要的。
    “三肥五水”一般来说是符合小麦生长需要的。但是，具体应用的时候，还必须根据雨量、气候、土质和作物生长等等情况来决定，不是一成不变的。“三肥五水”实质上是合理的分期的使用水和肥的经验。孟县农民在“三肥五水”的原则下，灵活地掌握“看天、看地、看庄稼”来浇水。他们浇水有“三浇，三不浇，二保证”的灵活作法。他们这样做是完全正确的。情况变了，“三肥五水”的具体作法也应当随着改变。
    在我国主要产麦区的北方，小麦一生差不多是在干旱缺雨的季节度过的。干旱成了限制小麦生长发育和提高产量的一个重要因素。进行人工灌溉、施肥等措施，就可弥补自然条件的不足，变小麦低产为高产。许多小麦产量较高的地区，如山东黄县1956年全县小麦亩产达到二百六十三斤多，河北藁城县达到二百八十七斤半，陕西长安县达到三百二十六斤多，还有许多千斤丰产单位，他们在麦田管理上的作法，基本上符合“三肥五水”的经验。南方麦产区追施“腊肥”和“春肥”，基本上也符合这个经验的。这些地区小麦分期施肥，产量也较高。如太湖地区的松江专区一百多万亩小麦，1956年亩产达到二百斤。
    目前各地正在积极开展小麦的田间管理，根据具体情况，充分利用“三肥五水”的经验，小麦的田间管理工作就可以作得更好。　（路万程）（附图表）

　　澳大利亚  4，953  4，084  —17.55  5，939  5，323  —10.38
    在1949年至1955年的六年中，我国小麦面积扩大了四分之一，总产量增加了三分之二；而同时期美国和澳大利亚的小麦生产都缩减了，加拿大的小麦面积也缩小了五分之一多。我国小麦单位面积产量的增长速度也很快，仅次于加拿大，超过美国、意大利和澳大利亚；但是，单位面积产量的生产水平还低于上述国家，比其中最高的意大利每公顷相差一点一公吨，比其中最低的澳大利亚，相差零点四四公吨。
    这些情况说明：我们在小麦生产方面还需要作很大的努力，以求单位面积产量达到世界最高水平。同时也说明：只要我们按照这几年的速度或者更高的速度急起直追，一定能达到世界最高水平。
