    New Year Goods Delivered to Your Door
    Inspired by the new upsurge in socialist construction, the employees of the Chongnei Avenue Second Central Store of the Beijing State-Operated Retail Company came up with the idea of "door-to-door delivery." They used trucks to deliver Spring Festival goods, such as chickens, ducks, meat, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and daily necessities, to remote hutongs and alleys for citizens to purchase. Residents in areas such as Suianbo Hutong and Dongshicao were very happy. Old Lady Guo from Dongshicao said, "The state is taking such good care of us citizens! Our government is becoming more and more considerate!"

    年货送到家
    北京国营零售公司崇内大街第二中心商店的职工，受到社会主义建设新高潮的鼓舞，想出了“送货上门”的办法，把鸡、鸭、肉、油、盐、酱、醋、日用百货等春节用品，用货车送到偏静的胡同和小巷子里，供市民选购。遂安伯胡同、东石槽等地的居民都很高兴。东石槽的郭老太太说：“国家对咱们市民照顾得太周到了，咱们的政府越来越体贴人心了！”
