The bloody crime of French planes indiscriminately bombing peaceful villages in Tunisia has aroused universal indignation among the people of the world. The governments of many countries have successively issued statements expressing sympathy and support for the Tunisian people. However, the murderous thugs are so unscrupulous that they are even now openly threatening and intimidating the Tunisian people.

On February 11, French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard, in a speech to the National Assembly, distorted the facts and insisted that France's intrusion into another country to carry out massacres was an "exercise of legitimate self-defense." Supposedly, this was because Tunisia supported the Algerian people's struggle for independence, and therefore was "de facto" in a "state of war" with France. He even hinted menacingly that French troops might carry out similar "retaliation" against Tunisia in the future; if the Tunisian government took "any adventurous action," "the Tunisian people would be the first to suffer."

What an utterly unreasonable and arrogant attitude! The French government seems to think that they can disregard international law and arbitrarily invade other countries by virtue of their power and force, and that the Tunisian people can only bow their heads and be slaughtered under their pressure. However, the era of colonialist tyranny is gone forever. The French government's insane massacres, threats, and intimidation of the Tunisian people will only strengthen the Tunisian people's determination to defend their national independence and increase their hatred of French colonialists. Currently, throughout Tunisia, the struggle to protest the atrocities of French aircraft is unfolding with increasing intensity. The Tunisian government has firmly demanded that French troops withdraw from Tunisia and has ordered the prohibition of French warships from entering the port of Bizerte.

The French colonialists' acts of aggression have also been severely condemned by world public opinion and strongly opposed by the people at home.

But why does the French government, already in a difficult position in the Algerian war, dare to engage in such a reckless adventure in Tunisia? People cannot help but notice the attitude of the U.S. government. Recently, the United States has given France several hundred million dollars in economic "aid" to support France in continuing its colonial war in North Africa. Most of the twenty-five French planes that carried out the bombing in Tunisia were also supplied by the United States. After the incident, Dulles assured the French ambassador to the United States that the U.S. government would not issue "any sharp criticism" of France and stated at a press conference that it would "minimize the impact of this incident." It is precisely because of the support of the United States that French colonialists dare to be so rampant.

Of course, the United States also has its own plans in these actions. Therefore, while supporting French colonialists, it also makes a hypocritical gesture toward the Tunisian people. Dulles, in meeting with the Tunisian ambassador to the United States, spoke at length about the "friendship" between the United States and Tunisia. A few days ago, the U.S. International Cooperation Administration also allocated $80,000 to aid the victims of the bombing. State Department spokesman White expressed a willingness to help France and Tunisia resolve the current crisis peacefully and fairly. What is the purpose of this American hypocrisy? White inadvertently revealed it: they are worried that Tunisia will actually demand the withdrawal of French troops; they will do everything possible to persuade Tunisia not to file a complaint with the Security Council; and they want to arrange for a United Nations observer group to conduct inspections on the Tunisia-Algeria border. This is the "good intention" of America, the self-proclaimed friend of Tunisia. The Tunisian people will neither be intimidated by French threats nor deceived by American hypocrisy.

    不许杀人凶手继续猖狂
    本报评论员
    法国飞机滥炸突尼斯和平村庄的血腥罪行，激起了全世界人民的普遍的义愤。很多国家的政府先后发表声明，对突尼斯人民表示同情和支援。但是，杀人的凶手却肆无忌惮到如此的地步，甚至在目前还公然对突尼斯人民进行威胁和恫吓。
    2月11日，法国总理盖伊阿在国民议会发表的谈话里颠倒黑白地把法国闯进别的国家去进行屠杀硬说成是“行使正当的自卫权利”。据说，这是因为突尼斯支持阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争，于是“事实上”就同法国处于“交战状态”。他甚至杀气腾腾地暗示：法国军队今后还可能对突尼斯进行类似的“报复”；如果突尼斯政府采取“任何冒险行动”，“突尼斯人民将首先遭殃”。
    这是多末横蛮无理和狂妄无耻的态度啊！法国政府好像认为，他们凭着强权和武力就可以蔑视国际法而任意对其它国家进行侵略，而突尼斯人民在他们的压力下只能够低头任人宰割。然而，殖民主义者横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。法国政府对突尼斯人民的疯狂屠杀和威胁恫吓，只会更加加强突尼斯人民保卫祖国独立的决心和增加对法国殖民主义者的仇恨。目前，在突尼斯全国，抗议法机暴行的斗争正在日益汹涌地展开。突尼斯政府坚决要求法国驻军撤出突尼斯，并且下令禁止法国军舰进入比塞大港。
    法国殖民主义者的侵略行动也遭到了世界舆论的严正谴责和国内人民的强烈反对。
    但是，为什么目前在阿尔及利亚战争中处境已经狼狈不堪的法国政府，还敢于疯狂地在突尼斯进行这样一场冒险呢？人们不能不注意到美国政府的态度。最近美国给予法国几亿美元的经济“援助”，支持法国在北非把殖民战争继续打下去。在突尼斯进行轰炸的二十五架法国飞机，大部分也都是美国供给的。而在事件发生以后，杜勒斯又向法国驻美大使保证美国政府将不对法国发表“任何尖锐的批评”，并且在记者招待会上表示要把这个“事件的影响缩小到最低限度”。正是因为有美国的撑腰，法国殖民主义者才敢于这样猖狂。
    当然，美国的这些做法也有着自己的打算。因此，它在支持法国殖民主义者的同时，又对突尼斯人民作出一副伪善的姿态。杜勒斯在接见突尼斯驻美大使时就大谈其美国和突尼斯的“朋友交情”。前几天美国国际合作署还拨出八万美元来救济在轰炸中的受难者。国务院发言人怀特表示愿意帮助法国和突尼斯和平公正地解决目前的危机。美国这种伪善的目的何在呢？怀特在无意之间吐露了出来：他们担心突尼斯当真要求法军撤退；他们要尽一切力量劝说突尼斯不要向安理会提出控诉；要安排在突尼斯—阿尔及利亚边境上，由联合国观察小组来进行视察。这就是自称为突尼斯的美国朋友的“好心肠”。突尼斯人民是既不会被法国的恫吓所吓倒，也不会被美国的伪善所欺骗的。
