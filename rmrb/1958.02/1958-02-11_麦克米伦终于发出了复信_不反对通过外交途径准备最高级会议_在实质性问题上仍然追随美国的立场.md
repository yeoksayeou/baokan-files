Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th: British Prime Minister Macmillan's reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin's letter of January 8th was published here today.

Macmillan's reply retains some flexibility on the procedural issues of holding a highest-level meeting, but expresses agreement with the US position on substantive issues. He expressed acceptance in principle to the proposal of holding a highest-level meeting, but at the same time emphasized that "there must be adequate preparation" before holding such a meeting. Although the Soviet Union has expressed opposition to holding a foreign ministers' meeting first, and pointed out that a foreign ministers' meeting is likely to be used by Western countries to undermine the convening of a highest-level meeting, Macmillan still believes that holding a four-power foreign ministers' meeting of the US, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is "the best way to begin." However, he did not insist on holding a foreign ministers' meeting as a prerequisite for convening a highest-level meeting. In his letter, he proposed "another method," which is to conduct preparatory work "through secret diplomatic exchanges." He stated, "If either of these two suggestions proves to be acceptable to the governments concerned, then the specific arrangements for the relevant foreign ministers' meeting or diplomatic exchanges should be conducted without delay through the diplomatic representatives of these countries stationed in Moscow."

Regarding which countries could participate in the highest-level meeting, Macmillan stated that although he suggested holding a four-power foreign ministers' meeting first, this does "not affect the final composition of the summit meeting later on."

On the important agenda issue, Macmillan echoed the US. He said that he "fully agrees" with the suggestions made by US President Eisenhower. However, the suggestions made by Eisenhower in his reply to Bulganin actually reiterated the US's aggressive policies, such as abolishing the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council, requiring the Soviet Union to accept the Western proposal for "free elections" in Germany, and discussing the so-called "situation in Eastern European countries," which is interference in the internal affairs of the Eastern European people's democratic countries.

In the final part of his reply, Macmillan again stated that both sides "have one thing in common, and that is extreme concern for maintaining peace."

He said, "On this basis, we should be able to hold a beneficial meeting and achieve positive results."

Macmillan did not put forward his own proposals for the agenda in this letter. It was noted that he did not mention the issue of a mutual non-aggression treaty between Eastern and Western countries, which he had previously mentioned in his reply to Bulganin, nor did he mention Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, although he had stated in his previous reply that the British government was studying whether it could serve as "the basis for some alternative proposals."

According to Western news agencies, Macmillan had suggested a rough date for the summit in the initial draft of his reply, but later cancelled this under US pressure.

Commenting on this reply, the British "News Chronicle" wrote that Macmillan's reply was "tentative, delayed, and passive." The newspaper pointed out that the Western countries' current responses to Bulganin's letter still lack practical counter-proposals.

### 麦克米伦终于发出了复信  不反对通过外交途径准备最高级会议  在实质性问题上仍然追随美国的立场

    麦克米伦终于发出了复信
    不反对通过外交途径准备最高级会议
    在实质性问题上仍然追随美国的立场
    新华社伦敦10日电　英国首相麦克米伦对苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁1月8日信件的复信今天在这里发表了。
    麦克米伦的回信在举行最高级会议的程序问题上保留了某些伸缩性，但在实质性问题上表示赞同美国的立场。他表示在原则上接受举行最高级会议的主张，但是同时强调，在举行这样的会议以前“必须有充分的准备”。尽管苏联已经表示反对首先举行外长会议，并且指明外长会议很可能被西方国家利用来破坏最高级会议的召开，但是，麦克米伦仍然认为，举行美、英、法、苏四国外长会议是“最好的开始办法”。不过，他并没有坚持举行外长会议作为召开最高级会议的先决条件，他在信中提出了“另一种办法”，就是可以“通过秘密的外交来往”来进行准备工作。他表示，“如果这两种建议中的任何一种证明是有关国家政府可以接受的，那么，有关外长会议或者外交来往的具体安排最好毫不拖延地通过这些国家驻莫斯科的外交代表来进行。”
    在关于哪些国家可以参加最高级会议的问题上，麦克米伦表示，他虽然建议先召开四国外长会议，但是这并“不影响到以后的政府首脑会议的最后组成情况”。
    在重要的议程问题上，麦克米伦跟着美国说话。他说，他“完全赞同”美国总统艾森豪威尔所提出的那些建议。但是，艾森豪威尔在给布尔加宁的复信中提出的建议，实际上都是重申美国的侵略政策，例如要取消安全理事会中的大国一致原则，要苏联接受西方关于在德国举行“自由选举”的主张，以及讨论干涉东欧人民民主国家内政的所谓“东欧国家形势”问题等。
    麦克米伦在复信的最后部分又表示，双方“有一点是共同的，那就是对维护和平极为关心。”
    他说：“在这个基础上，我们应该能够举行一次有益的会议并且取得肯定的结果。”
    麦克米伦在这封信里并没有提出英国自己关于议程的建议。人们注意到他没有提到他以前在给布尔加宁复信中所提到过的东西方国家签订互不侵犯条约问题，也没有谈到波兰关于在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议，虽然他在上次复信中曾经表示，英国政府正在研究，看看它是否可以作为“某种替代性的建议的基础”。
    据西方通讯社前些时候报道，麦克米伦在复信的最初的草稿中，曾经建议召开最高级会议的大致日期，后来在美国压力下取消了这一点。
    英国“新闻纪事报”在评论这封复信时写道，麦克米伦的复信是“试探性的、拖迟了的、被动的”。这家报纸指出，西方国家目前对布尔加宁信件的答复仍然缺乏实际可行的反建议。
