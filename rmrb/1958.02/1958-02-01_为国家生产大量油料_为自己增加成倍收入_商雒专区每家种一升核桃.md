Produce a Large Amount of Oil for the Country, Increase Income Many Times Over

Shangluo Prefecture Plants One Sheng of Walnuts Per Household

(Our newspaper's dispatch) The Shangluo Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shaanxi Province called on the masses in the entire region to launch a campaign to plant one sheng of walnuts per household. Because this method requires little investment but yields large profits, it has been warmly supported by the broad masses of farmers.

The Shangluo area is a poor mountainous region. The Shangluo Prefectural Committee has considered many ways to utilize the region's natural resources to increase people's incomes and change the face of the mountainous area. Calling on the masses to "plant one sheng of walnuts per household" is one of the methods.

The masses in the Shangluo area have traditionally had the habit of planting walnuts, and almost every household has several walnut trees. Therefore, when the Shangluo Prefectural Committee launched the campaign to "plant one sheng of walnuts per household" in September of last year, the broad masses warmly responded to the call, and a mass movement quickly formed. In the Qinling Mountains and along the banks of the Dan River, planting walnuts by the masses could be seen everywhere. The masses in the Heishan area of Shang County, under the slogan of "Turning barren mountains into money-making trees and transforming desolate mountains into orchards," launched a competition for planting walnut trees between townships and between agricultural cooperatives. In less than ten days, the entire area planted more than fifty-eight shi and six dou of walnuts, exceeding the original task. Party, government, and military organs at the prefectural level, as well as staff members of Shang County and Danfeng County-level organs, purchased a total of seven shi and nine dou of walnuts, all of which were planted. According to statistics from November of last year, the entire prefecture sowed more than one thousand three hundred and seventy shi of walnuts, accounting for 44% of the total number of walnuts that should be sown in the entire region. Many districts, townships, or agricultural cooperatives have overfulfilled the task of planting one sheng of walnuts per household. According to the person in charge of Shangluo Prefecture, the task of planting one sheng of walnuts per household can be fully completed this year.

At the same time, each county also mobilized the masses to plant other economic forest trees according to local conditions. Shangnan County called on each household to plant one sheng of tung tree seeds; Zhen'an and Zhashui Counties called on the masses to plant chestnuts; Shang County and Luonan County called on the masses to plant pepper, grapes, and persimmon trees, and achieved great results. For example, Shangnan County has planted an average of one sheng and five ge of tung tree seeds per household, overfulfilling the task of one sheng of tung tree seeds per household.

Leaders at all levels in the Shangluo area adhered to the mass line working method in the movement. Some people in the Hongxing Cooperative in Luonan County were initially unwilling to plant walnuts, believing that "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst," and the walnut planting movement could not be carried out. The cooperative leaders used the method of accounting and comparison to educate the members. After comparing increased income, increased oil, and less spending with greater benefits, the members actively launched the walnut planting movement. In just one meeting, the members reported three shi of walnuts, enabling each member household to plant more than one sheng of walnuts. The problem of insufficient seeds was also solved by mobilizing the masses, with relatives helping relatives and neighbors helping neighbors, adjusting with each other, and sharing what they had.

Carrying out the one-sheng-of-walnuts planting movement is a very important measure to increase the income of the people in mountainous areas and the wealth of the country. The Shangluo Prefectural Committee has calculated an account based on local conditions. There are a total of 310,000 farmer households in Shangluo Prefecture. If each household plants one sheng of walnuts (about 100 walnut trees), and calculated at the lowest survival rate (50%), it can increase 50 walnut trees. Each member of a five-person household would then have an average of ten trees. Walnut varieties in the Shangluo area are three-year (fruit bearing), five-year, and seven-year, and some bear fruit in the second year of planting. But generally, they yield benefits in seven or eight years. If each tree produces an average of two dou of walnuts, then ten trees can produce two shi; calculated at 2.5 yuan (purchase price) per year, each person can increase their income by 50 yuan per year. This is nearly double the current annual income of farmers from agriculture and sideline occupations in the area (an average of 30 yuan). After fifteen years, each tree can still produce more than one shi per year, so that each person can receive 250 yuan, which is equal to seven or eight times the current average annual income per person in the mountainous area. A farm household can earn about 1,250 yuan.

In addition, increased walnut production will also increase a large amount of oil for the country. If each household in the entire prefecture plants 50 trees, and each tree yields two dou of walnuts, more than 124 million jin of oil can be extracted each year. If these walnuts are exported, they will bring back a large amount of foreign exchange for the country. (Zhu Bo)

### 为国家生产大量油料　为自己增加成倍收入  商雒专区每家种一升核桃

　　为国家生产大量油料　为自己增加成倍收入
    商雒专区每家种一升核桃
    本报讯　陕西中共商雒地委号召全区群众开展每户种一升核桃的运动，由于这个办法投资少，获利大，受到了广大农民的热烈拥护。
    商雒地区是一个贫困的山区。商雒地委曾想过不少的办法来利用这个地区的自然资源，以增加人民的收入，改变山区的面貌。号召群众“每家种一升核桃”，就是办法之一。
    商雒地区的群众历来就有种植核桃的习惯，差不多每家都有几棵核桃树。因此，当商雒地委于去年9月号召开展“每家种一升核桃”的运动后，广大群众热烈地响应了这个号召，并且很快地形成了一个群众性的运动。在秦岭山区，在丹江两岸，到处可以看到群众栽种核桃。商县黑山区的群众在“秃山养起了摇钱树，荒山变成花果园”的口号下，开展了乡与乡、社与社的种核桃树的竞赛，不到十天，全区就种了五十八石六斗多核桃，超过了原定任务。专区一级的党、政、军机关和商县、丹凤县级机关的工作人员，共购买七石九斗多核桃，全部都种上了。根据去年11月份统计，全专区共播种一千三百七十多石核桃，占全区应播种核桃总数的44％。有很多区、乡或农业社，超额完成了每户种植一升核桃的任务。据商雒专区负责人说，今年就可以全部完成每户种一升核桃的任务。
    与此同时，各县还因地制宜地发动群众种植其它经济林木。商南县号召每户种一升桐籽；镇安、柞水县号召群众种栗子；商县、雒南县号召群众种花椒、葡萄、柿子树等，也获得很大成绩。例如商南县平均每户已播种一升五合桐籽，超额完成了每户一升桐籽的任务。
    商雒地区各级领导在运动中坚持了群众路线的工作方法。雒南县红星社有些人最初不愿意种核桃，认为“远水解不了近渴”，种核桃运动一直开展不起来。该社领导上利用算账对比的方法教育社员，经过比增加收入，比增加油料、比花钱少收利大以后，社员们都积极展开种植核桃运动。仅在一次会上，社员就自报出三石核桃，使每户社员种了一升多核桃。种子不足的问题，也是由于发动群众，亲帮亲、邻帮邻，互相调剂，互通有无，获得解决的。
    开展种一升核桃运动是增加山区人民收入和国家财富的一个非常重要的措施。商雒地委曾根据当地情况算过一笔账。商雒专区农民共有三十一万户，每户种一升核桃（约一百棵核桃），按最低成活率（50％）计算，能增加五十棵核桃树，五口之家的农户每人平均即合十棵树。商雒地区的核桃品种有三年生（结核桃）、五年生和七年生的，还有当年种第二年结果的。但一般的七八年就有收益。每棵平均结二斗核桃，十棵就可以结两石；每年按二元五角（收购价）计，则每人每年就可以增加五十元的收入。比目前当地农民每人一年农副业收入（平均三十元）增加近二倍。十五年以后每棵树一年还可结一石多，这样每人可以收到二百五十元，等于现在山区每人每年平均收入的七、八倍。一户农民可以收入一千二百五十元左右。
    此外，核桃增产了还将给国家增加大量油料。如果全专区每户种五十棵，每棵结核桃以两斗计算，每年即可榨一亿二千四百多万斤油。如果把这些核桃出口，将会给国家换回一笔数目很大的外汇。　（朱波）
