Gansu Determined to Work Hard for Three Years to Change the Entire Face
Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, February 5th: The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the revolutionary and enterprising spirit of "Looking at five years in three, three years in the first year, and the first year in the previous winter," recently proposed an ambitious plan: to mobilize the entire party to work hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of agriculture, local industry, culture, and hygiene throughout the province.

There are three major indicators for agriculture and forestry:

Vigorously develop water conservancy. The province currently has 60 million mu of cultivated land. Before liberation, only 6 million mu were irrigated, and by 1957, including the newly built areas, there were a total of 12.23 million mu. The plan is to develop 10 million mu in 1958, and 7.5 million mu each in 1959 and 1960, for a total of 25 million mu in three years, which is more than twice the total in 1957, and more than four times that before liberation. By the end of 1960, the province will have 37.23 million mu of irrigated land. Based on an agricultural population of 10.85 million, this averages more than 3.5 mu per person, realizing water conservancy throughout the province.

Vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work. The total area in the province that needs soil and water conservation is 200,000 square kilometers. Before liberation, there was almost no such construction. In the eight years since liberation, only 30,000 square kilometers have been completed. The plan is to achieve "integrated gully management, terraced fields covering the mountains, embankments on every field, interconnected embankments, no mud leaving the gullies, and no water leaving the plateaus" on 70,000 square kilometers of land by 1960. This planned figure is more than twice the amount completed in the past few years. By 1960, the total area of soil erosion controlled in the province will be 100,000 square kilometers, accounting for 50% of the total soil erosion area, creating conditions for the complete fulfillment of this task.

Vigorously plant trees and grass, green barren mountains and ridges, and increase the area of vegetation cover. Gansu Province has an area of 690 million mu, and by 1957 the vegetation cover was only 62.77 million mu, accounting for 9.2% of the total area. The plan is to increase the vegetation cover by 80 million mu in five years, with 60 million mu completed in three years, half for planting trees and half for planting grass. This figure is nearly one and a half times the legacy of many years before liberation plus the results of eight years of work. By 1960, the total vegetation cover in the province will be more than 120 million mu, accounting for 18% of the total area, laying the foundation for realizing greening.

The main indicator for local industry is to vigorously develop local industry, doubling the leap forward within three years, and laying the foundation for exceeding the total value of agricultural output in five years. Local industry in Gansu Province is backward. It has developed slowly in the eight years since liberation, and by the end of 1957, the total output value only reached 150 million yuan, which is only equal to 7% of the total agricultural output value. The plan is to increase this to 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion yuan within three years, which is 24 to 27 times that of 1952, and 8 to 9 times that of 1957, with an annual increase rate of 100%. The main guidelines and methods for developing local industry are: to face the countryside, serve agricultural production, and at the same time serve large-scale industry, opening up broad development paths for local industry; to rely on mass investment, with flourishing results everywhere, with the entire party and all the people running industry, striving to have factories in every township; to fully utilize the province's mineral, plant, and animal resources, adapting to local conditions, and making every effort to develop various types of local industry; during construction, to implement a combination of specialized business organizations and the broad masses, a combination of large and small-scale projects, a combination of the latest technology and general technology, a combination of mechanical operation and manual labor, and a combination of building new enterprises and fully utilizing old enterprises; to trial-produce new products, strive to improve product quality, reduce costs, and strive to quickly bring product quality up to the advanced national level, opening up domestic and foreign sales channels for various local industrial products. After the implementation of this plan, it can be guaranteed that under the continuous growth of agricultural production, by 1962, the output value of local industry will exceed the total output value of agriculture, which is equal to 18 times that of 1957 and more than 50 times that of 1952.

There are two main indicators in culture and hygiene:

One is primary school education. Before liberation, more than 80% of school-age children in Gansu Province were out of school. Now, there are more than 1.33 million children in school, accounting for 50.63% of school-age children. The original plan was to have 2.45 million children in school by 1962, accounting for 92.11% of school-age children, realizing universal primary education. The revised plan is to basically complete this task by 1960. At the same time, the education of ordinary middle schools and normal schools will be developed accordingly to meet the needs of the development of primary schools.

The other is the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "four pests." Based on the specific conditions of Gansu, the plan is to basically eliminate the "seven pests" - rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, flies, white gnats, lice, and bedbugs - by 1960. At the same time, on this basis, carry out one to two years of finishing and consolidation work to make Gansu a "seven-free" province. And through the work of eliminating the "seven pests," fundamentally improve environmental hygiene and personal hygiene conditions, and change the unhygienic habits of the masses of not paying attention to ventilation in their residences, people without toilets, livestock without pens, drinking raw water, not washing their faces and clothes regularly, not taking baths all year round, and spitting everywhere. Gansu is mountainous, and in the past, transportation was inconvenient and culture was backward, so the sanitary conditions in both urban and rural areas were not very good. Fundamentally changing this situation in three years is unprecedented and unrecorded in history.

Although these are only a few indicators, and although it is only a rough plan, it is nevertheless a great plan full of revolutionary spirit.

The plan is great because it is advancing at an extremely unusual speed. Taking the construction of irrigated land as an example, if we follow the reliable records of nearly a thousand years in history books, Gansu has always been arid, and only 6 million mu of irrigated land were built by the time of liberation. According to this speed, it would take at least 4,000 years to complete 25 million mu of irrigated land. Even if we calculate according to the 6.23 million mu of newly built irrigated land in the eight years after liberation, it would take 32 years to complete 25 million mu of irrigated land. Looking at the development speed of local industry, the annual increase rate is 100% from 1958 to 1960, while the annual increase rate is 23% from 1952 to 1957. If we want to reach the target of this plan at the latter speed, the time required would be several times longer than three years.

The plan is great because it will fundamentally change the face of Gansu in many ways. Drought has made the people of Gansu turn pale at the mention of it. When each agricultural population has 3.5 mu of irrigated land, the initiative for a bumper harvest will always be in the hands of the farmers. Even if they encounter years of no rain, it will still not affect the farmers' affluent life, thus freeing them from the threat of drought to people for thousands of years. The face of local industry will also leap from scarcity to prosperity. In the countryside, the phenomenon of nearly half of the school-age children being out of school will be rapidly changed, replaced by the cultural prosperity of "every commune has a school, and every household has students." Everyone pays attention to hygiene, changing the old customs of many years. Barren mountains and ridges will gradually be replaced by the beautiful scenery of thousands of peaks towering and green meadows covering the land.

The plan is great because it mainly relies on the manpower, financial resources, and materials of the masses to complete. When discussing this plan, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on everyone to face the 12 million people of the province and not to ask the state for money everywhere. This plan was formulated in this spirit. For example, to develop local industry, many parts rely on mass investment for construction, with the slogan: every township has a factory. For another example, to develop primary school education, it is planned to increase the number of children in school run by the masses from 260,000 to 1.26 million, which is equal to nearly 50% of all enrolled children. For another example, the construction of water conservancy is also mostly completed by relying on the strength of the masses. In this way, several billion or more than ten billion yuan of funds can be saved for the country.

Of course, because Gansu only has 12 million people, is not economically wealthy, has a weak local industrial base, and the development of cultural and educational undertakings is slower than in other provinces, these factors will bring difficulties to the realization of the three-year plan, and the task borne by the people of Gansu is doubly heavy. However, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is full of confidence. Because, when this plan met with the responsible comrades of the local committees, everyone said that they would definitely guarantee its completion. Everyone believes that although Gansu Province is poor, it makes the people full of revolutionary spirit, able to endure hardship, and create conditions for a happy life. The construction of 10 million mu of irrigated land in 1958 is a manifestation of this spirit. Now, all departments are filling in concrete content according to this plan and specifically arranging their work.

　　全省水利化　全民办工业　社社办学校　人人讲卫生
    甘肃决心苦战三年改变全部面貌
    本报兰州5日电　中共甘肃省委，最近根据“五年看三年，三年看头年，头年看前冬”的革命进取精神，提出一个气魄磅礴的计划：全党动员起来，苦战三年，使全省农业、地方工业、文化卫生面貌根本改观。
    农业和林业方面有三大指标。
    大力兴修水利。全省现有耕地面积六千万亩。解放以前只有水地六百万亩，到1957年加上新修的共有一千二百二十三万亩。计划1958年修一千万亩，1959和1960年各修七百五十万亩，三年共修二千五百万亩，等于1957年总数的两倍多，等于解放以前的四倍多。至1960年底，全省将有水地三千七百二十三万亩。按一千零八十五万农业人口计算，每人平均三点五亩以上，全省实现了水利化。
    大力进行水土保持工作。全省需要进行水土保持的面积共二十万平方公里。解放以前，几乎等于没有此项建设。解放以后八年，只完成三万平方公里。计划到1960年，在七万平方公里的土地上做到“沟壑兼治，遍山梯田，地地有埂，坝埂相连，泥不出沟，水不下塬”。这个计划数字，等于过去几年完成的二倍多。到1960年，全省根治的水土流失面积总计为十万平方公里，占水土流失总面积50％，给全部完成此项工作创造了条件。
    大力植树种草，绿化荒山秃岭，增大复盖面积。甘肃省面积为六点九亿亩，至1957年复盖面积只有六千二百七十七万亩，占总面积9.2％。计划在五年内增加复盖面积八千万亩，三年内完成六千万亩。植树种草各半。这个数字，等于解放以前多少年遗留下来加上八年工作结果的近一倍半。到1960年，全省复盖面积为一亿二千多万亩，占总面积的18％，给实现绿化奠定了基础。
    地方工业的主要指标是，大力发展地方工业，三年内要加倍地跃进，为五年超过农业总产值打下基础。甘肃省的地方工业是落后的，解放以后八年来发展较慢，至1957年底总产值才达到一亿五千万元，只等于农业总产值的7％。计划在三年内增加到十二亿元至十四亿元，等于1952年的二十四至二十七倍，等于1957年的八至九倍，每年递增率是100％。发展地方工业的主要方针和方法是：面对农村，为农业生产服务，同时为大工业服务，给发展地方工业打开广阔的发展道路；依靠群众投资，遍地开花结果，全党全民办工业，争取乡乡有工厂；充分利用全省矿、植、动物资源，因地制宜，千方百计发展各种各样地方工业；建设时贯彻专门业务机关与广大群众相结合、大型与小型相结合、最新技术与一般技术相结合、机械操作与手工劳动相结合、建设新企业与充分利用旧企业相结合；试制新产品，努力提高产品质量，降低成本，争取尽快地使产品质量赶上全国的先进水平，为各种地方工业产品打开内外销路。实现这个计划以后，即可保证在农业生产不断增长的情况下，到1962年，地方工业产值超过农业的总产值，即等于1957年的十八倍、等于1952年的五十余倍。
    文化卫生方面有两个主要指标。
    一个是小学教育。解放以前，甘肃省的学龄儿童80％以上失学。现在，在学儿童一百三十三万余人，占学龄儿童50.63％。原计划到1962年在学儿童为二百四十五万，占学龄儿童92.11％，实现小学普及教育。这次修改的计划是，到1960年基本完成此项任务。同时，相应地发展普通中学、师范学校的教育，以适应小学发展的需要。
    另一个是以消灭“四害”为中心的爱国卫生运动。根据甘肃的具体情况，计划到1960年，基本消灭“七害”——老鼠、麻雀、蚊子、苍蝇、白蛉子、虱子、臭虫。同时，再在这个基础上进行一年到两年的扫尾、巩固工作，使甘肃成为“七无”省。并且通过除“七害”的工作，根本改善环境卫生、个人卫生状况，改变群众居住不注意通风、人无厕所、牲畜无圈、饮生水、不经常洗脸洗衣服、终年不洗澡、随地吐痰不卫生习惯。甘肃多山，过去交通不便、文化落后，城乡卫生状况都不太好。三年内基本改变这种状况，是前无古人、史无记载的。
    上述这些，虽然只有几项指标，虽然只是个轮廓的计划，然而却是个充满革命精神的伟大的计划。
    计划之所以伟大，是因为它在用极不一般的速度跃进。以修水地为例，如果根据近千年来史书确实的记载，甘肃一直干旱，到解放时才修水地六百万亩，依照这个速度想完成二千五百万亩水地，至少要四千年。即使依照解放以后八年新修水地六百二十三万亩计算，想完成二千五百万亩水地，也要三十二年的时间。再拿地方工业发展速度来看，1958—1960年每年递增100％，而1952—1957年每年递增23％，如果用后一种速度想达到这次计划的指标，需要的时间当数倍于三年。
    计划之所以伟大，是因为它将从许多方面根本改变甘肃的面貌。干旱使甘肃人民谈虎色变。当每个农业人口据有三点五亩水地的时候，丰收的主动权永远操在农民手里，纵然遇到经年不雨的天时，仍不影响农民过富裕的生活，从此解脱了几千年来干旱对人们的威胁。地方工业面貌，也由稀少一跃而为繁荣。农村里，迅速改变近半学龄儿童失学的现象，代之而起的是“社社有学校，户户有学生”的文化昌盛之貌。人人讲卫生，改变了多少年的陈风旧俗。荒山秃岭，逐渐要被万峰耸翠、绿茵满地的美景代替。
    计划之所以伟大，是因为它主要是依靠群众的人力、财力、物力完成。在讨论这个计划时，中共甘肃省委号召大家面向全省一千二百万人民，不能处处都向国家要钱。这个计划，就是在这种精神下制订出来的。例如，发展地方工业，不少的部分是依靠群众投资兴建，口号是：乡乡有工厂。又如，发展小学教育，准备把群众办学的在学儿童由二十六万人增至一百二十六万人，等于全部入学儿童的近50％。再如兴修水利，也是大部分依靠群众力量去完成。这样，可以为国家节省几亿或十几亿元资金。
    当然，由于甘肃只有一千二百万人口、经济上不太富裕、地方工业基础薄弱、文化教育事业较其他省发展的慢，这些因素会给实现三年规划带来困难，甘肃人民负担的这个任务是加倍沉重的。但是，中共甘肃省委却充满信心。因为，当这个计划与各地委负责同志见面的时候，大家都表示一定保证完成。大家认为，甘肃省虽穷，却使得人民充满了革命的精神，能够忍受艰苦，为过幸福的生活创造条件，1958年兴修一千万亩水地，便是这种精神的表现。现在，各部门正根据这一方案充填具体的内容，具体安排自己的工作。
