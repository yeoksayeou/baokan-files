China's Steel Industry Will Definitely Catch Up With and Surpass the UK Within Fifteen Years
Pei Yingwu, Wang Zhongyi

The Party Central Committee has put forward a fighting task to the people of the whole country: to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important industrial products in the next fifteen years. This heroic and glorious task greatly inspires the people of the whole country.

Can we complete this task? If we say yes, what is the basis for it?

First, let's analyze the British steel industry.

The United Kingdom is the oldest capitalist country, and its steel industry developed very early. In the 1870s, Britain produced about six million tons of pig iron annually, more than the United States, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Japan combined. But by the end of the 19th century, British steel production had been surpassed by the United States and Germany. From 1900 to 1956, the development speed of the British steel industry was very slow, with an average annual increase of only 2.6%. The growth of British steel from 1900 to 1956 is as follows:

According to the British authorities' plan, steel production will reach 28 million tons in 1962. According to the most optimistic estimate (an average annual increase of 3.5% to 4%), steel production will reach 36 million to 39 million tons within fifteen years, that is, in 1972. According to the following analysis, China's steel production will definitely be able to catch up with this level within fifteen years. Moreover, for the UK, the above calculation is obviously too optimistic, because it will encounter various difficulties in the development process.

First, it will be interrupted by economic crises. There have been many such events in history. Since 1900, there have been fourteen years when steel production was lower than the previous year, that is, in a quarter of the years, production only decreased and did not increase. During the economic crisis from 1920 to 1921, British steel production dropped from 9.21 million tons to 3.76 million tons, a decrease of 60% in two years. After six years, it was not until 1927 that it recovered to the level of 9.21 million tons. But soon, during the economic crisis from 1929 to 1932, steel production fell again to 5.29 million tons, and it took another two or three years to recover and exceed the level of 1929. The situation of iron production was even worse. The output in the year before World War I (1913) was 10.43 million tons, and it never exceeded this level for forty years, until it slightly exceeded it in 1952.

The inevitable capitalist economic crisis will inevitably interrupt the development of the British steel industry.

Second, the UK lacks domestic resources. The proven reserves of iron ore are only 2.4 billion tons (total reserves are estimated at 3.8 billion tons), and more than 98% of them are low-grade ores with an iron content of less than 30%. Calculated according to the current pig iron production, the ore reserves are only enough for about thirty-five years. All manganese ore is solved by imports. Although the situation of coal mines is better, the determined reserves are 120 billion tons, but the coal mining volume was 292.2 million tons in 1913 and 225 million tons in 1956, a decrease of 22.6% in more than forty years. Due to the scarcity of domestic resources, the raw materials for the British steel industry—iron ore—are solved by imports. In addition, about 2 million tons of scrap steel and pig iron are imported from foreign countries every year. The proportion of iron ore solved by imports, calculated by iron content (％):

	1950	1951	1952	1953	1955
	53.9	50.4	52.7	53.5	60

Is it possible to rapidly develop the steel industry on such a basis? This is impossible. With the establishment of steel industries in other countries and the awakening of colonies and dependent countries, the UK's sources of raw materials will become increasingly difficult.

Third, sales difficulties. British steel products rely on foreign markets, and exports account for about 14% of total output. If machinery products made from steel are included, it accounts for more than one-third. According to the British Iron and Steel Board's plan, from 1954 to 1962, steel consumption will increase by 6.6 million tons, of which 43% will be exported. It is highly doubtful whether this hope can be realized. Because increasing exports will first be subject to the squeeze of other capitalist countries. After the First World War, the share of British steel product exports in major capitalist countries gradually declined:

	1913	1929	1937	1954
	30.3％	19.6％	16.3％	13.79％

Most of the UK's exports are to colonies and economically underdeveloped countries. In 1956, the UK's exports to these countries accounted for at least 60% of total exports. These countries will not rely on imported steel for a long time. For example, India is one of the larger countries exporting British steel, but India plans to increase steel production to 4.3 million tons from 1960 to 1961 (1.73 million tons in 1956). With its own steel industry, India will gradually reduce its purchases of steel from the UK.

The domestic market is not ideal either. In recent years, due to equipment renewal and the arms race, the machinery manufacturing and construction industries have had some development, which has promoted the increase in steel production. But these factors will not remain unchanged for a long time.

What is the situation of China's steel industry?

In 1949, China's steel production was only 158,000 tons. After three years of recovery, it reached 1.35 million tons in 1952, exceeding the highest annual output in history, an increase of 7.5 times in three years. The first five-year plan was also completed ahead of schedule. In 1957, steel production reached 5.24 million tons, an increase of 2.9 times in five years, with an average annual increase of 31.2%. This development speed is unprecedented in the history of any capitalist country. China's steel production has jumped from the 18th place in the world to the 10th place, surpassing seven countries including Canada, Luxembourg, Sweden, Australia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Austria. It should be pointed out that China's iron ore production in 1957 has exceeded that of the UK.

Looking to the future, according to Comrade Li Fuchun's report at the Trade Union Congress, steel production will reach at least 12 million tons in 1962, an increase of 1.3 times in five years, with an average annual increase of 18%. According to extrapolation and estimation, the third five-year plan can be increased by one time, reaching 24 million tons in 1967, with an average annual increase of 14.9% in five years; the fourth five-year plan only needs to increase by another 0.67 times, that is, an average annual increase of 10.7%, to reach the level of 40 million tons in 1972, definitely exceeding the UK. Judging from the speed already achieved in the past, the growth rate of the third and fourth five-year plans is completely achievable. If we work well, it is also possible to exceed it. Pig iron production, which is decisive for the development of the steel industry, may catch up with the UK about five years earlier.

There is a precedent for this speed of development in the steel industry in socialist countries. If the increase in steel production in China's several five-year plans is compared with the corresponding period in the Soviet Union (the third and fourth five-year plans are based on extrapolation and estimation), it is as follows:

	China	Soviet Union
	Year	Average annual increase in steel production	Year	Average annual increase in steel production
	1953—1957	780,000 tons	1929—1932	400,000 tons
	1958—1962	1.35 million tons	1933—1937	2.36 million tons
	1963—1967	2.4 million tons	1946—1950	3 million tons
	1968—1972	3.2 million tons	1951—1955	3.6 million tons

It can be seen from the above table that this growth rate of China's steel industry has already been practiced in the Soviet Union. China's current international environment and technical conditions are more favorable than those of the Soviet Union at that time. China is not isolated and helpless now, but has the support of the great Soviet Union with forty years of construction experience and other fraternal countries. It is not in an era of general scientific and technological development, but in a new era of highly developed science and technology. Under such conditions, we have no reason not to reach the growth rate that the Soviet Union has already reached.

From the domestic point of view, there are four basic conditions that can develop the steel industry at a high speed.

First, China has abundant iron ore and coal resources, which are the most important raw materials and fuel for the steel industry. According to incomplete statistics, China's prospective reserves of iron ore are more than 12 billion tons, and a large part of them have been proven or will be proven. According to the production of 40 million tons of steel and 38 million tons of pig iron in 1972, China's known iron ore reserves can be mined for one hundred years. The prospective reserves of coal mines are even more considerable, about 1 trillion tons or more. Most of China's coal can be coked, which is a valuable fuel source for the steel industry and can be used inexhaustibly. Other raw materials such as manganese ore and tungsten and molybdenum used for smelting alloy steel are very abundant. The reserves of tungsten and molybdenum are among the highest in the world.

Second, China has an extremely large domestic market. This is because China has a population of more than 600 million, because China wants to build a great socialist country with modern industry and modern agriculture from an economically backward and populous country in a short period of time. We need to accelerate the development of the steel industry to meet the growing needs. In terms of per capita steel production, reaching 40 million tons of steel in 1972 means that the average person (based on a population of 900 million) will only have 44.4 kilograms (only 8.2 kilograms in 1952), while the Soviet Union had an average of 229 kilograms per person in 1955. It can be seen that the capacity of China's domestic market is very large.

This situation clearly shows how much steel is needed for our country.

Third, China's construction force and technical force have grown up. During the first five-year plan, we focused on the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, and began the construction of the two major integrated enterprises, Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel. During this period, the newly added production capacity used by enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry due to investment was 3.16 million tons of pig iron and 2.3 million tons of steel, with an average of almost three blast furnaces put into production every year. In the second five-year plan, the first phase of Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel will be fully completed in 1961 and 1962 respectively, and the construction of more than a dozen small and medium-sized iron and steel complexes will also begin, and the old factories will be renovated. The construction and renovation of these enterprises undoubtedly plays a huge role in the development of the steel industry. After the completion of all the projects to be built in the first five years and the second five years, the production scale will reach more than 20 million tons.

The reason why we have achieved such achievements is due to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, but we have also seen the growth of our own construction forces. China has been able to design iron and steel complexes with a scale of more than one million tons, and equipment can also be produced and supplied by domestic enterprises. The recent situation shows that the design and equipment production of some workshops of Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel will be brought back to China, including giant primary rolling mills with more than 100,000 parts and weighing more than 7,000 tons. It is certain that the situation in the third and fourth five years will be better.

The production achievements of existing enterprises are also numerous, and the utilization indicators of equipment have reached the international level.

Fourth, and most fundamentally, we have the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, the leadership of Chairman Mao, and the socialist system that has been established politically and economically, which is the most fundamental guarantee for the invincibility of all our undertakings. Of course, we will encounter difficulties on our way forward, but these difficulties will surely be overcome by our heroic people.

China's steel industry has infinitely bright prospects, just like the rising sun, with boundless radiance. The future of the British steel industry is very dim and full of difficulties. We firmly believe that within fifteen years, China's steel production will definitely catch up with and surpass the UK.

　　钢铁工业十五年内一定能赶上并超过英国
　　裴英武　王仲毅
    党中央向全国人民提出了战斗的任务：要在今后十五年内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国。这个豪迈而光荣的任务，大大地鼓舞着全国人民。
    我们能够完成这个任务吗？如果说能，其根据何在？
    首先让我们来分析一下英国的钢铁工业。
    英国是一个最老的资本主义国家，钢铁工业的发展也很早。在十九世纪七十年代，英国每年大约生产了六百万吨生铁，比美国、法国、意大利、德国、俄国、和日本加在一起还多。但到十九世纪末，英国的钢铁产量先后被美国、德国所超过。在1900年到1956年间，英国钢铁工业的发展速度十分缓慢，每年平均增长仅为2.6％。自1900到1956年英国钢铁的增长情况如下：
    根据英国当局的计划，1962年钢产量将达到二千八百万吨，按照最乐观的估计（每年平均增长3.5％到4％计）十五年内，即1972年，钢产量将可达三千六百万至三千九百万吨。根据以下的分析，十五年内，我国的钢产量是一定可以赶上这个水平的。何况，对英国来说，以上的计算显然还是太如意了，因为它在发展过程中将要遇到种种的困难。
    第一，将遭到经济危机所中断。历史上有过不少这类的事。自1900年以来，钢的产量比上一年度低的有十四次，也就是四分之一的年份里产量只有减少，而没有增加。在1920到1921年的经济危机，英国的钢产量由九百二十一万吨下降到三百七十六万吨，即两年中降低60％。经过六年的时间，即到1927年才恢复到九百二十一万吨的水平。但不久，1929到1932年的经济危机，钢产量又下降到五百二十九万吨，再经过二、三年的恢复，才超过1929年的水平。铁的生产情况更不妙，第一次世界大战前一年（1913年）产量是一千零四十三万吨，四十年来从未超过这个水平，直到1952年才稍微超过。
    不可避免的资本主义的经济危机必然打断英国钢铁工业的发展。
    第二，英国本土资源缺乏，铁矿已探明的储量仅二十四亿吨（总储量估计为三十八亿吨），而且其中98％以上是贫矿，含铁量不到30％。按照现在的生铁产量计算，矿量也只够用三十五年左右。锰矿全部靠进口解决。煤矿的情况虽然好些，确定的储量为一千二百亿吨，但煤的开采量，1913年是二亿九千二百万吨，1956年是二亿二千五百多万吨，四十多年来，反而下降22.6％。由于国内资源的贫乏，英国钢铁工业的原料——铁矿是依靠进口来解决的。此外，每年还靠外国进口废钢、生铁二百万吨左右。铁矿靠进口解决的比重，按含铁量计算（％）：
    1950年　1951年　1952年　1953年　1955年
    53.9　50.4　52.7　53.5　60
    难道可以在这样的基础上迅速发展钢铁工业吗？这是不可能的。随着其他国家钢铁工业的建立，殖民地和附属国的觉醒，英国的原料来源将日益困难。
    第三，销路的困难。英国的钢铁产品依赖国外市场，输出额约占全部产量的14％左右，如果包括制成品的机械产品在内，则达三分之一以上，按照英国钢铁局的计划，自1954到1962年，消费钢材增长六百六十万吨，其中43％要输出。这种希望能否实现，大值得怀疑。因为增加输出，首先要遭到其他的资本主义的排挤。第一次世界大战后，英国钢铁产品的输出量在主要资本主义国家中所占的份额是逐步下降的：
　　1913年　　1929年　　1937年　　1954年
　　30.3％　　19.6％　　16.3％　　13.79％
    英国的输出大部分是殖民地及经济不发达的国家。1956年英国对这些国家的输出至少占输出总数60％以上。这些国家不会长久依赖进口钢铁的，例如印度是英国钢铁输出的较大的国家之一，但印度计划在1960年到1961年把钢的生产提高到四百三十万吨（1956年是一百七十三万吨），有了自己的钢铁工业，印度向英国购买钢铁将逐渐减少。
    国内市场也不太理想，近年来由于设备更新，以及军备竞赛，机械制造和建筑业有了少许的发展，这是促使钢铁生产增加的因素。但这些因素是不会长久不变的。
    我国钢铁工业的情况又是怎样呢？
    1949年我国的钢产量只有十五万八千吨，经过了三年的恢复，1952年达到一百三十五万吨，超过了历史上最高年产量，三年中增加七点五倍。第一个五年计划也提前完成，1957年钢产量达到五百二十四万吨，五年内增加二点九倍，平均每年增长31.2％，这个发展速度是任何资本主义国家历史上所没有的。我国钢产量已由原来的占世界第十八位跃居于第十位，超过了加拿大、卢森堡、瑞典、澳大利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利和奥地利等七个国家。应该指出，1957年我国铁矿石的产量已超过了英国。
    展望将来，第二个五年根据李富春同志在工会代表大会上的报告，1962年钢产量至少可达到一千二百万吨，五年增加一点三倍，平均每年增长18％。根据推算和估计，第三个五年可以增加一倍，1967年将达到二千四百万吨，五年平均增长14.9％；第四个五年只需再增加零点六七倍，即每年平均增长10.7％，即可在1972年达到四千万吨的水平，肯定地超过英国。从过去已经达到的速度来看，第三、第四两个五年的增长速度是完全可以达到的。如果我们工作得好，还有可能超过。对发展钢铁工业有决定意义的生铁产量，将可能提前一个五年左右赶上英国。
    钢铁工业的这种发展速度，在社会主义国家中就有先例。如果将我国几个五年钢产量的增长与苏联相当时期比较（第三和第四个五年计划是根据推算和估计），如下：
　　中国    苏联
　　年份  每年平均增加的钢产量　年份  每年平均增加的钢产量
　　1953—1957年  78万吨  1929—1932年  40万吨
　　1958—1962年  135万吨  1933—1937年  236万吨
　　1963—1967年  240万吨  1946—1950年  300万吨
　　1968—1972年  320万吨  1951—1955年360万吨
    从上面这个表可以看出，我国钢铁工业的这种增长速度，在苏联已经实践了。我国现在所处的国际环境和技术条件比苏联当时有利。我国现在不是孤立无援，而是有四十年建设经验的伟大的苏联以及其他兄弟国家的支援，不是处在一般的科学技术发展时代，而是处于科学技术高度发展的新时代。在这样的条件下，我们没有理由达不到苏联已经达到的增长速度。
    从国内讲，还有四个基本条件可以高速度地发展钢铁工业。
    第一，我国拥有丰富的铁矿和煤矿资源，这是钢铁工业最主要的原料和燃料。据不完全的统计，我国铁矿的远景储量在一百二十亿吨以上，并且很大一部分是已经探明或将要探明的。按照1972年生产钢四千万吨，生铁三千八百万吨计，我国已知的铁矿储量就可以开采一百年。煤矿的远景储量更可观，约在一万亿吨以上，我国的煤绝大部分可以炼焦，是钢铁工业的宝贵燃料源泉，可以用之不竭。其他原料如锰矿和冶炼合金钢用的钨、钼是十分丰富的。钨矿和钼矿的储量在世界上居首位。
    第二，我国拥有极其广大的国内市场。这是因为我国拥有六亿以上的人口，因为我国要在不长的时期内把原来经济落后、人口众多的国家建成一个具有现代工业和现代农业的伟大社会主义国家。我们需要加速发展钢铁工业来满足日益增长的需要。以每人平均钢产量来讲，1972年钢达到四千万吨，每人平均（按九亿人口计算）也只有四十四点四公斤（1952年只有八点二公斤），而苏联在1955年以人口平均每人就有二百二十九公斤，可见我国国内市场容量很大。
    这个情况十分清楚地说明，钢铁对我们的国家来讲，是多么的需要。
    第三，我国建设力量和技术力量已经成长起来了。第一个五年计划期间，我们着重建设鞍钢，开始建设武钢和包钢两大联合企业。在这期间内，冶金工业部所属企业由投资而动用的新增加的生产能力，生铁是三百十六万吨，钢二百三十万吨，平均每年差不多有三座高炉投入生产。第二个五年，武钢和包钢第一期工程将分别在1961年、1962年全部建成，同时还开始建设十多个中小型的钢铁联合企业，并对旧厂进行改建。这些企业的建设和改建，无疑地对钢铁工业的发展起着巨大的作用。在第一个五年以及第二个五年将要建设的项目，全部建成后生产规模将达到两千万吨以上。
    我们所以取得这样的成就，是由于苏联的无私援助，但也看到我国自己建设力量的成长。我国自己已经能够设计百万吨以上规模的钢铁联合企业，设备也可由国内企业生产供应。最近的情况表明，武钢和包钢的部分车间的设计和设备的生产，将拿回国内来做，其中包括像由十万多个零件、重七千吨以上的巨型初轧机。肯定地说，在第三、第四个五年的情况将会更好。
    现有企业的生产成绩也不少，设备的利用指标已达到了国际水平。
    第四，也是最根本的条件，是我们有伟大的中国共产党的领导，有毛主席的领导，有已经在政治上和经济上确立了的社会主义制度，这是我们一切事业无往不胜的最根本保证。在我们前进的道路上当然也会遇到困难，但是这些困难必定会被我们英勇的人民战胜。
    我国钢铁工业有着无限美好的发展前途，正如旭日东升，光芒万丈。而英国钢铁工业的前途则十分暗淡，困难重重。我们坚信，在十五年内，我国钢铁的产品产量一定能赶上并超过英国。
