    Overcoming Idleness from Multiple Perspectives
    to Better Promote Winter Production
    (Our report) Sichuan's winter production work has achieved great success due to the timely strengthening of labor organization and the improvement of tools. After the winter production movement formed a high tide in mid-December last year, the production work progressed rapidly in some areas, but in many other areas, the work was not well organized, resulting in idleness, waste, and low production efficiency. In response, the relevant provincial departments promptly notified all localities, requesting them to strengthen specific ideological leadership and meticulous organizational work, improve labor organization, improve tools, and accelerate the development of the movement.
    In terms of improving labor organization, various localities have successively adopted methods such as work queuing, labor queuing, and organizing specialized teams (groups); to participate in water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and winter crop field management, so that labor use can be adjusted. The labor organization at construction sites also adopted methods such as group contracting, piece-rate wages, and labor competitions, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for production. The secretary of the Langzhong County Party Committee discovered problems with labor organization and project planning at the Shiyi District Reservoir construction site, and promptly mobilized everyone to study and solve them, which enabled the entire project to be completed fifteen days ahead of schedule, saving more than 10,000 laborers.
    In terms of improving tools, various localities cherish the wisdom and creativity of the masses. The secretary and commissioner of the Nanchong Prefectural Party Committee personally went to Huofeng Mountain to transform the mountain with the masses, and promoted the gunpowder blasting method, which greatly accelerated the progress of the project. The entire area has now transformed more than 30,000 mountains, accounting for more than 50% of the total task. The secretary and county head of the Nanjiang County Party Committee personally led more than 300 cadres to go deep into the construction site and promoted 23 kinds of tools created by the masses, such as "bulldozers," "lever tamping machines," and "mud transport boats," which increased work efficiency by one to five times. In just five days, the number of water conservancy projects started in the county jumped from 10% to 137%. (Rao Xuecheng)

    从多方面克服窝工现象
    促进冬季生产更好开展
    本报讯　四川各地的冬季生产工作，由于及时加强劳动组织，改良工具，已经取得很大成绩。去年12月中旬，冬季生产运动形成高潮后，个别地区各项生产工作进展快，但还有不少地区，工作组织得不好，造成了窝工浪费、生产效率不高的现象。据此，省有关部门及时通报各地，要求加强具体的思想领导和细致的组织工作，改进劳动组织，改良工具，加速运动的发展。
    各地在改进劳动组织方面，先后采用了工作排队、劳力排队、组织专业队（组）等办法；参加兴修水利、积肥、小春田间管理等项工作，使劳力使用有所调剂。工地劳动组织也采取了分组包工、按件计工、劳动竞赛等办法，大大刺激了群众生产的积极性。阆中县委书记在施依区水库工地发现劳力组织和工程计划有问题，及时发动大家研究解决，使整个工程提前十五天完成，节省一万多个劳动力。
    各地在改良工具方面，十分珍惜群众的智慧和创造。南充地委书记和专员亲自到火烽山和群众一道改造山头，推广了火药爆炸法，大大加速了工程的进展，全区现已改造了三万多个山头，占总任务的50％以上。南江县委书记和县长亲自率领三百多个干部深入工地，推广了群众创造的“推土车”、“杠杆打夯机”、“运泥船”等二十三种工具，提高工效一至五倍，仅五天内使全县水利工程开工数由10％跃进到137％。　（饶学成）
