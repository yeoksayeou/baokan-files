    Self-interest at the Expense of Others

    U.S. Senator Humphrey recently introduced a bill to the U.S. Congress requesting authorization for the U.S. government to further dump an additional $4 billion worth of surplus agricultural products abroad. He advocated turning "troublesome surplus agricultural products" into a supplementary means for the U.S. to "strengthen the free world."

    From this senator's words, one can understand a principle: the so-called U.S. effort to "strengthen the free world" is nothing more than reducing its own troubles by increasing the troubles of others. This is not limited to dumping surplus agricultural products.

    损人利己
    美国参议员汉弗来最近向美国国会提出一项法案，要求国会授权美国政府再增加向国外倾销四十亿美元的剩余农产品，他主张把“麻烦的剩余农产品”变成美国“加强自由世界”的一种补充手段。
    从这位参议员的话中，人们可以悟出一个道理：美国的所谓“加强自由世界”的努力，无非是以增加别人的麻烦来减少自己的麻烦之谓耳。这岂止在倾销剩余农产品一方面哉。
