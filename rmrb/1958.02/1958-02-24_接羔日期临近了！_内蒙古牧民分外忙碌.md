Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 23rd: Mongolian herdsmen living in the grasslands of Xilingol, Ulanqab, and Chahar League in western Inner Mongolia have started preparations for lambing half a month earlier this year than in previous years. More than 50,000 Mongolian herdsmen on the Xilingol grassland will harvest more than one million newborn young livestock this spring. In Sunite Right Banner, more than 130,000 pregnant female animals will begin lambing in large numbers on March 1st. Therefore, in addition to comprehensively preparing lambing supplies such as lambing medicines, felt tents, rubber gloves, and building lambing warm sheds and warm pens, herdsmen have also organized and trained a group of lambing personnel. Herdsmen on the Ulanqab grassland have organized lambing mutual aid teams and prepared supplies such as yurts and hand-held horse lanterns.

Now, the Xilingol and other grassland pastures have begun night patrols and are managing livestock in separate groups to ensure the safety of pregnant animals and improve the survival rate of young livestock.

    接羔日期临近了！
    内蒙古牧民分外忙碌
    据新华社呼和浩特23日电　居住在内蒙古西部锡林郭勒、乌兰察布和察哈尔盟草原上的蒙古族牧民，今年都比往年提前半个月开始了接羔的准备工作。锡林郭勒草原上的五万多蒙古族牧民，今年春天将收获一百多万头以上的新生幼畜。在苏尼特右旗的十三万多头怀胎母畜，3月1日将开始大批产羔，因此，牧民们除全面准备接羔药品、毡包、胶皮手套等接羔用具和修设接羔暖棚暖圈外，还组织训练了一批接羔人员。乌兰察布草原上的牧民们，已经组织了接羔互助组，并准备好蒙古包、手提马灯等用品。
    现在，锡林郭勒等草原牧场已开始打更巡夜，对牲畜进行分群管理等，保证孕畜安全和提高幼畜保育率。
