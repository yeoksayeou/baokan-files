    Stuttering Correction School
    In the valley of the Saale River in the German Democratic Republic, in a quiet place surrounded by mountains and dense forests, there is a school specializing in correcting stuttering in children - the Friedrich Fröbel Stuttering Correction School.
    This stuttering correction school can accommodate ninety children. Children here attend school and, in addition to correcting their stuttering, also receive a regular education. To ensure close contact between teachers and students, the average class size is twelve to fifteen students. All children are boarders.
    The daily schedule at the school begins by creating a sense of stability in the children through a fixed routine. Sleep is particularly important. Therefore, the school attaches great importance to ensuring that children get enough sleep at night, and that they have a nap during the day. The school uses blackout measures and hypnosis to ensure that all children sleep well, thereby calming and resting their fragile nervous systems.
    The stuttering correction methods used at the Friedrich Fröbel Stuttering Correction School are particularly interesting, with a variety of different correction methods and means, mainly based on the Soviet scholar Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity. By lengthening the children's speech and rhythmic arm movements, stuttering children can generally speak fluently. The purpose of this method is to gradually eliminate old obstructive reflexes. The school's teachers implement this method in all courses. For example, in physical education class, rhythmic exercises such as the children running while beating small drums are used to eliminate their nervous tension. This method has very good therapeutic effects. In the year or so since the school opened, 85% of the children have seen their stuttering symptoms disappear, and 20% have already recovered and left the school.

    口吃矫正学校
    在德意志民主共和国萨雷河流域的山谷中，在一个群山环抱、森林茂密的幽静地方，有一所专门矫正儿童口吃的学校——弗利德里希·弗吕贝尔口吃矫正学校。
    这所口吃矫正学校可以容纳九十个孩子。孩子们在这里上学，除了能够矫正口吃，还能受到普通的教育。为了保证教员和学生的密切接触，每班学生人数平均是十二至十五个。儿童全部住宿。
    学校里每天日程的安排，首先是通过固定的秩序，使儿童有一种安定的感觉。特别重要的是睡眠。因此，学校非常重视使儿童们在夜晚有足够的睡眠，并且一定要有午睡。学校通过遮光和采用催眠法使所有的儿童都能睡好，从而使他们的脆弱的神经系统得到镇静和休息。
    弗利德里希·弗吕贝尔口吃矫正学校所采取的口吃矫正方法是特别有趣的，有各种不同的矫正方法和手段，主要是根据苏联学者巴甫洛夫关于高级神经活动规律的学说出发的。通过延长儿童们的说话和手臂的有节奏的摆动，一般可以使口吃儿童能流利地说话。这种方法的目的，就是使旧的阻碍反射逐渐消失。学校的教师们在各种课程中都贯彻使用这个方法，例如，在上体育课时，用孩子们自己边敲小鼓边跑步的有节奏的运动，来消除他们的神经紧张状态。这种方法的治疗效果很好。在学校开办的一年多时间内，已有85％的孩子消失了口吃症状，20％已经痊愈，离开学校了。
