Family Mutual Aid is Great
Representative Gao Fengqin Discusses Mutual Aid and Assistance Among Factory Workers' Families

In his government work report to the last National People's Congress, Premier Zhou mentioned that mutual aid and assistance among workers' families should be encouraged and promoted. Mutual aid and assistance are indeed very beneficial to solving the practical difficulties of the masses and to socialist construction. Now I will talk about the work of our factory workers' families in this regard.

Workers' Families Do a Good Job Supporting Production by Organizing Mutual Aid; Everyone Helps When Someone Has a Problem

Most of our workers' families are small families, with a couple living with several children. Ordinary days are fine, but when a family member has a baby or gets sick, the worker has to ask for leave to take care of them. For example, in our factory, when Yu Changying had a baby and needed someone to take care of her, but her husband was a foundry worker and the production line couldn't do without him. He didn't ask for leave, and his wife got angry and argued with him. Therefore, there are "three difficulties" when a family member has a baby or gets sick: first, it is difficult for the worker; second, it is difficult for the family; and third, it is difficult for the factory. The difficulty is that taking leave affects production, but not taking leave means there is no one to take care of the family. Our factory adds thousands of babies every year. If a thousand workers all ask for three days of leave for this matter, it would be equivalent to three thousand working days lost.

What should we do? At that time, the Party committee called on workers' families to do a good job in supporting production by managing their households well, and to assist workers in overfulfilling their production tasks. During the discussion, some family members suggested: We can't go to the workshop to help the workers with their work, but we can organize mutual aid. When someone has a problem, everyone helps, so that the workers don't have to ask for leave and delay production. This method was supported by everyone, so we started to organize mutual aid groups.

Voluntary and Without Conditions for Exchange; Persisting for Six Years Has a Great Impact on Production

Our mutual aid groups are a completely voluntary form of mutual help without conditions for exchange. For example, when someone has a baby or gets sick, the group provides people to cook, call a doctor, and take care of the children. Two people take turns to help each day, one doing errands, helping to buy groceries and call a doctor, and the other doing housework, helping to cook, wash clothes, and take care of the children. Each new mother can receive mutual aid for a week, and those with poor health can receive mutual aid for a longer period of time. In 1957, the family mutual aid groups helped 2,373 family members who were giving birth or sick, for a total of 4,925 days, so that workers did not have to ask for leave due to family matters. The mutual aid work among our factory families has persisted for nearly six years. Seeing that mutual aid really solves difficulties and has an impact on production, the family members are even more enthusiastic, and the content of mutual aid has become more and more extensive. For example, when a worker gets married, it's okay if it's on a Sunday, but if it's not, the new son-in-law has to renovate the house, pick up the bride, prepare the new quilt, etc., which requires at least one or two days of leave. With the mutual aid group, the family members take care of all these things. Huo Zhaoshan, a worker, originally planned to ask for leave on Saturday to tidy up his house for the wedding, but when he walked into the house on Friday night, he saw that the new house had already been tidied up. He said in surprise: "Wow! How come my house is different?" When Huo Zhaoshan got married, the family members of the mutual aid group dressed neatly and helped him pick up the new bride and entertain the guests. The new son-in-law didn't ask for a single day of leave, and the wedding was lively and bustling. The new son-in-law was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth and kept saying: "If I don't work hard to produce, I'll really be letting you down."

Setting Up Nurseries Without Spending a Penny of Public Funds; Organizing Savings Mutual Aid Groups to Solve Temporary Difficulties

After workers get married, they have children. Having children affects family members' participation in learning, sideline production, and social activities. However, the country wants to build socialism, and it is impossible to spend a lot of money to build nurseries and kindergartens for us. Therefore, we family members used the method of mutual aid to rely on our own strength to set up 115 nurseries and kindergarten classes that did not cost the public a penny. More than 2,600 children were admitted, accounting for more than 90% of all the children in the factory. How can we do it without spending a penny of public funds? Because the nursery staff are family members themselves, the houses are vacated by the family members themselves, and the toys and equipment are made by the family members themselves using waste materials. Each child only needs to pay a dime a month for refreshments.

We have also organized 114 savings mutual aid groups, with a total of more than 2,000 yuan in savings. Family members with temporary financial difficulties rely entirely on their own mutual aid savings to solve them. Savings mutual aid has three benefits: first, saving change into whole dollars is good for oneself; second, helping families in difficulty is good for others; and third, depositing money in the bank is good for the country.

In addition, in many things in our daily life, such as moving, buying rice, buying vegetables, and doing needlework, etc., if we encounter difficulties, we solve them by means of mutual aid. Because of the good mutual aid, we can complete the tasks of the neighborhood committee, such as greening, patriotic sanitation, and grain adjustment, very well.

Activists Lead Everyone to Work Together; No Longer "Each Sweeping the Snow in Front of His Own Door"

How can workers' families be so united and helpful? Family members often say: "Workers all over the world are one family." There is inherently a habit of mutual help among working people. Otherwise, we would not be able to survive. However, mutual aid is not something that can be done just by talking about it. Family members come from various different classes, especially the new workers who have increased in the past two or three years, and there are also many new family members, not all of whom are so united. There were many difficulties when we first organized mutual aid. Some said: "I don't need others to help me, and I don't help others." Some said: "I have a bunch of kids, and I can't help others." Some said: "Who's going to work for others for nothing?" We patiently explained to them the benefits of mutual aid for production, for the country, and for themselves. We made analogies, saying: production is like making shoes, there are those who make the uppers, those who make the soles, and those who sew the shoes. If the sole-makers don't work, there's no way to sew the uppers into shoes. We also gave them a detailed account: If a worker asks for three days of leave a year for his wife to have a baby, how much would all the workers in the factory be absent, and how much loss would production suffer? If the family mutual aid group can take care of all the family matters, even if it is not directly participating in production, it is also contributing to socialist construction, and the workers do not have to be absent, so their wage income is also higher. Family members understood that there were so many benefits, and some people joined in. Activists took the lead, they didn't mind getting dirty, didn't mind getting tired, weren't afraid of hardship, and weren't afraid of being scolded. They went to help whoever had a problem first. For example, Ding Xizhen, a family member, not only did not participate in mutual aid herself, but also attacked the activists, saying: "Go ahead, I'll let you earn a fancy coffin tomorrow." But when she was pregnant, the activists made shoes for her child, helped her tidy up her house, and took apart and washed the dirty quilt that hadn't been taken apart for years. When she gave birth, they enthusiastically cooked for her, called a doctor, and even washed her blood cloths and blood pants. She said with emotion: "You take care of me better than my own sisters. Who would have taken care of me in the old society?" Later, she also joined the mutual aid group and became an activist. After being helped and enlightened, the mutual aid team expanded day by day. Now there are 159 mutual aid groups in the factory, and 90% of the family members have joined. The phenomenon of "each sweeping the snow in front of his own door" has changed among the family members, and a new atmosphere of "everyone helping when one family has a problem" has been established. For example, Gu Shulan lost too much blood during childbirth, and more than a dozen people from the group immediately went to voluntarily donate blood to her. Yuan Shuqin's blood type matched, and it took three needles to find a blood vessel, but she didn't cry out in pain at all. He said: "As long as it is beneficial to production, I will do whatever it takes." Because family members organized mutual aid, workers produced with peace of mind. They said: "Even if I am transferred to the ends of the earth, I don't have to worry about my family."

I am an ordinary worker's family member. In 1950, I became the head of the family group. Under the education of the Party and the trade union, I worked with everyone to do some work. In 1952, due to work needs, the trade union transferred me to work as a full-time family work cadre. Over the years, I have deeply realized that family work mainly relies on the active family activists. The activists do not earn money or rice, they carry a lot of housework, take care of several children, and serve the masses wholeheartedly, regardless of weekdays, holidays, day and night. I don't have children and my family burden is not heavy. It is my duty to serve the masses. Why should I take the country's salary? Wouldn't it be better if I didn't take a salary so that I could be more closely integrated with the masses? In May 1957, I made this suggestion to the trade union, but the trade union did not approve it at that time. After the National Congress of Workers' Family Representatives and the last People's Congress, I clearly understood the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. I thought, if cadres like me do not separate from household labor and serve the masses, wouldn't the country save a lot of money? I became more determined and made a request to the trade union again, and the trade union agreed. Since September last year, I have been a family activist again, and I feel that my work is going more smoothly. Encouraged by the great call to "catch up with Britain in fifteen years," I am like the more than 1,300 family activists in the factory. The enthusiasm is getting bigger and bigger, and we all unanimously expressed that we will further do a good job in the family mass work and encourage the workers to stand at the forefront of the new upsurge of production!

    家属互助好处大
    高凤琴代表谈工厂职工家属互助互济情况
    周总理在上次全国人民代表大会的政府工作报告中，提到职工家属中的互助互济办法，应该提倡和推广。互助互济对解决群众的实际困难，对社会主义建设的确是有很大好处。现在我就谈一谈我们工厂职工家属在这方面的工作。
    职工家属搞好家务支援生产组织互助谁家有事大家帮助
    我们职工的家庭大都是小家庭，夫妻俩带着几个孩子过日子；平常日子还好，一遇到家属生孩子、生病等，就得职工请假在家照顾。像我们厂里家属于长英生孩子要人照顾，可是她丈夫是个铸工，生产上缺了他不行，他没有请假，老婆生气了就和他吵架。所以家属生孩子、生病有“三难”，一是职工难，二是家属难，三是工厂难。难的是请了假影响生产，不请假家里没有人照顾。我们厂一年能添上千个孩子，如果一千名职工都为这事情请假三天，合算起来就要缺勤三千个工作日。
    这怎么办呢？当时党委号召职工家属搞好家务支援生产，协助职工超额完成生产任务。在讨论的时候，有的家属就提出：咱们不能上车间帮助职工干活，咱们组织互助，谁家有事，大家帮助，别叫职工请假耽误生产。这个办法得到大伙的拥护，于是就开始组织互助组。
    自觉自愿不讲交换条件坚持六年对生产发生大作用
    我们的互助组，是一种完全自觉自愿的不讲交换条件的互相帮助。比如谁家生孩子、生病了，小组里有给作饭的、请医生的、带孩子的，每天轮流两人去互助，一个做外勤，帮助买菜、请大夫等；一个做内勤，帮助烧饭、洗衣、看孩子。每个产妇可以受到互助一星期，身体不好的还可互助得时间长些。一九五七年家属互助组，帮助生育、生病的家属作饭、洗衣、看孩子两千三百七十三人次，共四千九百二十五天，使职工没有因家事请假。我厂家属间的互助工作已经坚持了快有六年之久。家属们看到互助真解决困难，对生产发生了作用，劲头就更足，以后互助的内容就越来越多了。像职工娶媳妇，赶着礼拜天还好，不是礼拜天，新姑爷要刷新房、接新娘子、张罗新被子等等，至少得请一两天假。有了互助组，这些事家属们就都给包了。职工霍兆山本来准备星期六请假收拾房子结婚，谁知道星期五晚上走进屋看见新房已经收拾好，他惊奇地说：“呀！我这屋怎么两样了？”在霍兆山结婚的时候，互助组的家属打扮得齐齐整整，帮他去接新媳妇，招待客人。新姑爷一天假没请，喜事办得热热闹闹，新姑爷乐的嘴也合不上，直说：“我要不使劲生产，可真对不起你们”。
    不花公家一个钱办起托儿站  组织储金互助组解决临时困难
    职工结了婚，就要生孩子，有了孩子牵累，就影响家属参加学习，参加副业生产和社会活动。但是国家要建设社会主义，不可能用许多钱，为我们办托儿所、幼儿园。于是我们家属用互助的办法依靠自己的力量，办了一百一十五个完全不花公家一个钱的托儿站、幼儿班。收托了二千六百多个孩子，占全厂孩子的百分之九十以上。怎么能做到不花公家一个钱呢？因为托儿站的保育员是家属自己当的，房子是家属自己腾的，玩具、设备是家属利用废物自己做的，每个儿童入站，每月只要交一角钱点心费就行了。
    我们还组织了一百一十四个储金互助组，储金一共有二千多元，家属有临时性的经济困难，完全依靠自己的互助储金来解决。储金互助有三好：一是零钱攒整钱对自己好；二是互助困难户对别人好；三是把钱存银行对国家好。
    此外，我们在日常生活中许多事情像搬家、买米、买菜、做针线活等等，如果遇到困难，都用互助的办法来解决。由于互助得好，我们执行居民委员会的任务，如绿化、爱国卫生、调整粮食等等都能很好完成。
    积极分子带动大家一起干  不再是“个人自扫门前雪”
    职工家属怎么能团结互助得这样好呢？家属们常说：“天下工人是一家”，在劳动人民中本有相互帮助的习惯。不然就活不下去。可是互助并不是一说就能做到的，家属出身于各个不同的阶级，特别是近二、三年增加的新工人多，新家属也多，不是都那么齐心的。开始组织互助时困难很多，有的说：“我不用别人互助，我也不互助别人”。有的说：“我孩子一大堆，互助不了别人”。有的说：“谁去给别人白干活呢”。我们就耐心地给解释说，互助对生产、对国家、对自己的好处。给她们比仿说：生产好比做鞋，有做鞋帮的，有做鞋底的，有绱鞋的，做鞋底的不上班，光有鞋面就没法绱成鞋。又给她们算细账：一个职工一年为老婆生孩子请假三天，全厂职工得缺勤多少，生产将受多少损失。如果家里的事，家属互助组能全部担当起来，虽然不是直接参加生产，也是为社会主义建设出了一分力，而且工人不缺勤，工资收入也多。家属懂得有这么多好处，有些人就参加进来。积极分子走在前头，她们不嫌脏，不嫌累，不怕苦，不怕骂，谁家有事就先去互助。像家属丁喜珍原来不但自己不参加互助，还打击积极分子说：“干吧，明儿让你们挣个花头棺材。”但在她怀孕时，积极分子给她孩子做鞋，帮她收拾屋子，拆洗几年不拆的脏被子，在她生孩子时，又都热情地给她作饭、请大夫，连血布血裤都给她洗了，她感动地说：“你们照顾的真比亲姊妹还好，在旧社会谁来管我这些事呀？”以后，她也参加了互助组，成为一个积极分子。经过被互助和启发以后，互助队伍就这样一天天扩大起来。现在全厂有一百五十九个互助组，百分之九十的家属都参加了。家属中已经改变了“个人自扫门前雪”的现象，树立了“一家有事，大家帮助”的新风气。像顾淑兰生孩子流血过多，小组马上去了十多个人自愿为她输血，袁淑琴的血型对上了，扎了三针才找到血管，她一点不叫疼。他说：“只要对生产有利，叫我怎么都行。”因为家属组织了互助，职工生产非常安心。他们说：“把我调到天边，我也不用挂记家里了。”
    我是一个普通的职工家属，一九五零年当了家属小组长，在党和工会的教育下，和大伙一起作了一些工作。一九五二年因为工作需要，工会把我调作专职家属工作干部。几年来，我深深体会到家属工作主要是依靠广大家属积极分子做的。积极分子们不挣钱、不挣米，挑着一摊家务，带着几个孩子，无论星期、假日，不分白天黑夜，忠心耿耿地为群众办事。我没有孩子，家庭负担不重，我为群众办事是应该的，为什么要拿国家的报酬呢？我不拿工资不是更能和群众打成一片吗？一九五七年五月，我将这一意见向工会提出，当时工会没有批准。经过全国职工家属代表会议和上次人民代表会议，使我明确勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针。我想像我这样的干部如果都不脱离家务劳动为群众办事，国家不是可以节省不少一笔钱吗？我决心更大了，再次向工会提出要求，工会同意了。从去年九月份起，我又是一名家属积极分子了，我感到工作干得更顺利。在“十五年赶上英国”伟大号召的鼓舞下，我和全厂的一千三百多名家属积极分子一样。干劲愈来愈大，我们都一致表示要进一步做好家属群众工作，鼓励职工站在生产新高潮的最前面！
