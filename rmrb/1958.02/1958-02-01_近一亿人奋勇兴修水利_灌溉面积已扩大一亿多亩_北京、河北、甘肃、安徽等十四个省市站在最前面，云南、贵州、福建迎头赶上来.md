　　Nearly 100 Million People Vigorously Build Water Conservancy Projects
    Irrigated Area Expanded by Over 100 Million Mu
    Beijing, Hebei, Gansu, Anhui and other Fourteen Provinces and Cities Take the Lead, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Fujian Catch Up
    (Our dispatch) According to the water conservancy construction progress chart of the Ministry of Water Conservancy, the red arrow is rising straight up: From October 1st of last year to January 31st of this year, the nation's expanded irrigated area has reached 117.98 million mu, exceeding the original plan of expanding irrigated area by 92.21 million mu this year. At the same time, various regions have also achieved great results in improving irrigated areas and in managing low-lying areas and soil and water conservation.
    Currently, Beijing and Tianjin, as well as twelve provinces including Hebei, Gansu, Shandong, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, are at the forefront of this water conservancy construction effort.
    Some regions with originally lower water conservancy plans have recently revised their plans due to faster progress in projects. For example, Shaanxi Province has increased its original plan of adding 2.5 million mu of irrigated area to 10 million mu; Shanxi Province has also increased it from 2.5 million mu to 12 million mu.
    Yunnan, Guizhou, and Fujian provinces, where water conservancy construction progress had been relatively slow, conducted extensive mobilizations in January, determined to catch up with the advanced regions. The Guizhou Daily published three editorials, urging all regions not to be satisfied with the status quo, but to organize forces to rush to repair water conservancy projects. Now, Yunnan Province is close to completing its plan, and both Guizhou and Fujian provinces have made significant progress. Xinjiang's progress is still slow, reaching only 25% of its water conservancy construction plan so far.
    Materials received by the Ministry of Water Conservancy show that the enthusiasm for water conservancy construction in various regions is growing stronger. The number of people participating in construction was 20 to 30 million in October last year; by January this year, it had increased to nearly 100 million. In the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions, breaking with past practices, water conservancy construction has not been interrupted by the cold. Heilongjiang still has 1.5 million people working in severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. The nation's irrigated area is growing rapidly at an average rate of one million mu per day. Zhejiang Province has made arrangements for various regions to launch another upsurge in water conservancy construction after the Spring Festival.
    Regions where water conservancy construction is nearing completion are readjusting manpower to strengthen winter work such as accumulating fertilizer, preparing land, and selecting seeds.

### 近一亿人奋勇兴修水利  灌溉面积已扩大一亿多亩  北京、河北、甘肃、安徽等十四个省市站在最前面，云南、贵州、福建迎头赶上来

　　近一亿人奋勇兴修水利
    灌溉面积已扩大一亿多亩
    北京、河北、甘肃、安徽等十四个省市站在最前面，云南、贵州、福建迎头赶上来
    本报讯　中央水利部的水利建设进度表上的红箭头径直上升：从去年10月1日到今年1月31日止，全国扩大灌溉面积已达一万一千七百九十八万亩，原订今年扩大灌溉面积九千二百二十一万亩的计划，已经超额完成。与此同时，各地改善灌溉面积，治理洼地和水土保持工作也取得了巨大的成绩。
    目前，站在这次水利建设最前面的有北京、天津两个市，有河北、甘肃、山东、安徽、湖北、湖南、广东、广西等十二个省。
    有些原订水利计划较低的地区，因工程进展较快，最近修改了计划。例如陕西省已经把原计划增加灌溉面积二百五十万亩提高为一千万亩；山西省也由二百五十万亩提高为一千二百万亩。
    水利建设进度曾经比较迟缓的云南、贵州、福建三省，在1月份内进行了广泛的动员，决心迎头赶上先进地区。贵州日报曾三次发表社论，要求各地不要满足现状，而要组织力量赶修水利。现在，云南省已经接近完成计划，贵州、福建两省都有显著进展。新疆的进度仍然较慢，至今仅达到水利建设计划的25％。
    水利部收到的材料表明：各地兴修水利的劲头越来越大。参加施工的人数，去年10月为二、三千万人；到今年1月已经增加到近一亿人。在东北和内蒙古地区，打破了历年的惯例，水利建设一直没有因寒冷而间歇。黑龙江现在还有一百五十万人冒着零下三十度的严寒在施工。全国的灌溉面积正以每天平均一百万亩的速度在飞跃增长。浙江省向各地作了布置，在春节以后再掀起一个修水利的高潮。
    兴修水利已经接近结束阶段的地区，正在重新调整人力，以加强积肥、整地、选种等冬季工作。
