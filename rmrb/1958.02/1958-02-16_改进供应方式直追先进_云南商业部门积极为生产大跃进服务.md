Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, February 15th: Yunnan Province's commercial departments are striving to catch up, strengthening their service to the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

In the previous period, the guiding ideology of some commercial units in Yunnan lagged behind the situation, and the supply methods and commodities supplied could not adapt to the new circumstances. For example, farmers at reservoir construction sites needed small masks, goggles, and cold cream for wind, sand, and disease prevention, as well as wine, chili peppers, and ginger slices for cold protection, and salted vegetables and small pieces of cured meat for drinking. However, the supply work of the commercial departments could not keep up.

Recently, commercial departments in various parts of the province have intensified the adoption of new measures. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has prepared and supplied spring plowing production materials in advance. It is planned that the supply of new-style agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, etc., this year will increase from more than double to more than twenty times compared to last year. These spring plowing materials have already begun to be shipped to various places. In order to increase the supply of steel, cement, and utensils for water conservancy construction, the provincial commercial departments will, in conjunction with relevant departments, inspect the warehouses of industrial and mining enterprises and government agencies in Kunming and allocate unused or slowly used materials in a unified manner. The Provincial Service Department has decided to take measures such as processing acorn wine and compressing urban supply to vigorously supply white wine to construction sites, and to process a large number of cured meats, mooncakes, and dried salted fish into non-staple foods suitable for the needs of farmers at construction sites. In January, the provincial commercial departments supplied 200,000 masks, more than 20,000 goggles, and 3,000 gas lamps for nighttime lighting at construction sites. Because the clothing of migrant workers wears out quickly, the Provincial Department of Commerce and local commercial bureaus have shipped a batch of scrap fabric that does not require cloth coupons for migrant workers to mend holes.

Supply methods have also changed. Each county has set up temporary supply points at larger water conservancy construction sites and has also established many service stores such as barbershops, restaurants, cobblers, and tailors. Mobile supply teams have also been organized to supply water conservancy construction sites with fewer people. More than 30,000 grassroots supply and marketing cooperative cadres and other commercial cadres throughout the province have mustered their energy and plunged into the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in commercial work. They shuttle back and forth between construction sites and villages in the manner of "going to market on market days and visiting villages on idle days," "delivering goods to cooperatives and households," "integrating supply and marketing," and "supplying, investigating, and organizing sources of goods at the same time." As a result, business volume is increasing day by day everywhere.

### 改进供应方式直追先进  云南商业部门积极为生产大跃进服务

    改进供应方式直追先进
    云南商业部门积极为生产大跃进服务
    据新华社昆明15日电　云南省商业部门正奋起直追，加强为工农业生产大跃进服务。
    前一个时期，云南有些商业单位领导思想赶不上形势，供应方式和供应的商品都适应不了新的情况。例如水库工地上的农民要防风、防沙、防病用的小口罩、风镜、蛤蜊油，需要防寒用的酒、辣子、姜片，以及下酒用的咸菜、小块腊肉等等，但商业部门的供应工作却跟不上。
    近来省内各地商业部门已加紧采取新的措施。省供销社已提前准备和供应春耕生产资料，计划今年供应的新式农具、化学肥料、农药等，将分别比去年增加一倍多到二十几倍。这些春耕资料已经开始运往各地。为了增加修水利用的钢铁、水泥和用具的供应量，省商业部门会同有关部门将检查昆明工矿企业和机关的仓库，把不用或缓用的有关物资加以统一调拨。省服务厅决定采取加工橡子酒、压缩城市供应量等办法，大力给工地供应白酒，并且把大批腊肉、月饼、干咸鱼等加工成适合工地农民需要的副食品。省商业部门1月份已供应各地二十万个口罩、二万多个风镜和三千盏工地上夜晚照明用的汽灯。因为民工衣服磨损较大，省商业厅和各地商业局已运出一批不要布票的零头布，供民工补破绽用。
    供应方式也有了改变。各县都在较大的水利工地上设立了临时供应点，还设立理发、饭馆、补鞋、缝纫等许多服务性商店。在人数较少的水利工地上，也组织了货郎担流动供应。全省三万多名基层供销社干部和其他商业干部都已鼓起干劲，投入商业工作大跃进热潮。他们以“街天赶街、闲天串乡”、“送货到社到户”、“供销结合”、“边供应、边调查、边组织货源”等方式，在工地和村寨来回奔走。因此，各地营业额蒸蒸日上。
