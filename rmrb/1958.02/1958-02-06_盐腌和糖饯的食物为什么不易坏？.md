Why Salt-Pickled and Sugar-Preserved Foods Don't Spoil Easily?

　　Fresh food spoils easily when left in the air, but salt-pickled and sugar-preserved foods can be kept for a long time. Why is this?
    Food spoilage is due to the growth of microorganisms. Like all other living things, microorganisms need water to survive. Foods that have been salt-pickled or sugar-preserved contain salt or sugar that readily absorb moisture, not only drawing water out of the food itself, but also drawing water out of the microorganisms, so they cannot survive.
    If we add water to salt-pickled or sugar-preserved foods, or rinse them with water, then these foods will spoil easily. This is because diluted salt water or sugar water provides good conditions for the growth and reproduction of microorganisms.

　　盐腌和糖饯的食物为什么不易坏？
    新鲜食物放在空气里很容易腐坏，盐腌和糖饯的食物却能保存很久。这是为什么？
    食物的腐败是因为生长了微生物。微生物和其他所有生物一样，需要有水才能活。用盐腌或糖饯过的食物，因为盐或糖都善于吸收水分，不但把食物内部的水都吸出来了，同时连微生物体内的水也被吸出，微生物自然也就活不成了。
    如果我们在盐腌或糖饯的食物里加些水，或者用水去冲洗它们，那么这些食物又很容易腐败了。因为冲稀了的盐水或糖水，都是微生物生长和繁殖的好条件。
