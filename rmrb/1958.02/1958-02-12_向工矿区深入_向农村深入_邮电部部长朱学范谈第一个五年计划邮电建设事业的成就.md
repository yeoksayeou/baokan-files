I fully agree with the reports on the national budget and national economic plan made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Bo Yibo at the conference respectively; the report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen; and the report on the reform of the Chinese language and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme by Director Wu Yuzhang.

I would now like to briefly discuss the postal and telecommunications work and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme.

(I)
Postal and Telecommunications Work Serves Construction
I. The Development Plan for the Postal and Telecommunications Network is Overfulfilled
II. Anti-Waste Campaign Saves a Large Amount of Funds
III. Cadre Transfer Achieves Great Results

From 1953 to 1957, the postal and telecommunications departments carried out the construction work of the First Five-Year Plan. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, great achievements were made in all aspects during the five years. First of all, it is reflected in the development of the postal and telecommunications network. The vast majority of production targets have been overfulfilled. In order to meet the requirements of national socialist construction and socialist transformation, the growth of service institutions run by the postal and telecommunications departments themselves has been the most prominent, exceeding the original plan by 60 percent, reaching more than 22,000, more than tripling the number in 1952. Many emerging industrial areas have newly established postal and telecommunications institutions; especially the service coverage in rural areas has expanded rapidly, increasing thirteen times in 1957 compared to 1952. Now, on average, there is one self-operated postal and telecommunications institution in each district in the country, and there are also more than 24,000 agency outlets distributed throughout the country. This situation fully embodies the spirit of postal and telecommunications services serving industrial and mining construction and penetrating into rural areas to serve agricultural production. From the perspective of regional distribution, it also reflects the attention paid to the needs of ethnic minority areas: in five years, the postal and telecommunications institutions in Qinghai have developed nine times; Inner Mongolia has developed six times; Xinjiang has developed 5.8 times. The distribution of newly added institutions has greatly improved the communication situation in rural and ethnic minority areas. The total length of postal routes has extended to more than two million kilometers in five years, 98 percent of the townships in the country have access to postal routes, and 75 percent of agricultural cooperatives in the country are already directly delivering mail by the postal and telecommunications bureau's own delivery force. In terms of telecommunications, the number of telegraph circuits has increased by 20 percent in five years, the number of telephone circuits has increased by 31 percent, and the proportion of trunk line circuits has increased even more, increasing by 56 percent. International radio circuits have increased by 40 percent compared to 1952. In terms of urban telephones, sixteen cities have newly built and expanded automatic telephone exchanges, nine of which are completely newly built. These cities have used modern communication tools – automatic telephones – for the first time. With the rapid development of agricultural cooperativization, the telephones in smaller county towns have also developed rapidly, exceeding 85 percent of the original plan.

The achievements made by the postal and telecommunications departments during the First Five-Year Plan are certainly far more than these, and it is impossible to describe them all here. However, it can be said with certainty that the postal and telecommunications construction in the short eight years after liberation has far exceeded the 70 or 80 years before liberation. Taking the number of postal and telecommunications self-operated institutions set up in rural areas alone, the current number is more than 32 times higher than before liberation. The ironclad facts eloquently refuted the absurd fallacies of bourgeois rightists who claimed that "the present is not as good as the past."

In the second half of last year, a vigorous rectification and socialist education movement was launched in postal and telecommunications enterprises across the country. As the movement progressed, new atmospheres began to appear throughout the enterprise. In particular, the call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with or surpass Britain in terms of the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer, as well as the promulgation of the "Revised Draft of the National Program for Agricultural Development," greatly inspired the enthusiasm of all postal and telecommunications workers for building the socialist motherland. The situation of the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production and various undertakings has greatly inspired the vast number of employees, greatly boosted revolutionary vigor, and they have joined in a new upsurge of production to improve quality, improve services, practice strict economy, and strive to overfulfill and complete production and capital construction plans ahead of schedule. At present, the rectification movement in postal and telecommunications enterprises is being carried out in depth. Through big-character posters, debates, and correcting while rectifying, etc., a raging fire has been ignited for improving leadership styles, overcoming conservative ideas, streamlining administrative institutions, tightening staffing, opposing waste, and eliminating corruption and theft. Under the correct leadership of local Party and government departments, many postal and telecommunications enterprises, due to the enhanced socialist consciousness of the vast number of employees, have worked together with leaders and the masses to save a large amount of funds for the country by carefully calculating accounts and tapping potential. For example, the Beijing Post Office, from leaders to employees, jointly inspected and revised the conservative plans of the past. They first started by studying how to save transportation costs and found that there was great "potential" in it. The original plan was to use a train car from Beijing to Lanzhou, but it did not take into account that after the direct train service from Beijing to Chengdu was opened, the mail to Chengdu and various provinces in the Southwest no longer needed to go through Xi'an via the Beijing-Lanzhou line. After research, only half a car was needed for the entire car, which could save more than 300,000 yuan in transportation costs a year. Another example is the transportation of airmail. Originally, ordinary mail, registered mail, and international mail were all packed in separate mailbags. After research, they were sealed separately with paper covers and combined in one mailbag, which of course reduced the weight of the mailbag and also saved freight. It is estimated that 100,000 yuan can be saved a year. In addition, they found ways to save money in many other aspects. The total amount of savings is estimated to be about 1.7 million yuan for the whole year. At the same time, they also studied strengthening services and developing businesses, and it is estimated that they can increase production income by more than 700,000 yuan. This actual example fully illustrates that as long as we overcome conservative ideas, oppose waste, and resolutely implement the central government's policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, we will inevitably be able to promote the development of work and create a new atmosphere for enterprises.

Since the Party Central Committee correctly put forward the policy of "unified arrangement and comprehensive exercise," the ideological understanding of postal and telecommunications workers has been greatly improved. In particular, some intellectuals who used to underestimate labor have, under the actual education and influence, realized the great significance of directly participating in physical labor. Many intellectuals in the city who have always been engaged in office work have, under the education and call of the Party, proposed to go out of the office to do field work and go to the working masses. Many administrative management personnel and internal production personnel have changed their past views of underestimating field work and changed jobs to become mail carriers or rural postal and telecommunications service personnel. Recently, five section-level cadres from the Shenyang Post Office went out of the office to take on delivery work. The action of transferring cadres to lower levels for training not only shows the improvement of the ideological understanding of intellectuals, thereby better training themselves, but also this positive action has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of working people.

In accordance with the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical and diligent operation of enterprises put forward by the Party and the government, the postal and telecommunications departments will take active measures based on all possible conditions to continue to improve quality, improve services, and guide the positive factors of the vast number of employees in the rectification and socialist education movement into a new upsurge of production serving the great leap forward in industry and agriculture.

(II)
Postal and Telecommunications Workers Support Language Reform
I. Promoting Mandarin Makes it Easier to Make Phone Calls from All Over
II. Telegrams Can be Directly Transmitted in Pinyin Script
III. Technical Terms Can be Used in the National Language

Here I would like to briefly talk about the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme.

Director Wu Yuzhang has already mentioned in his report that the main purpose of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is to annotate Chinese characters and promote Mandarin. In order to enable the vast number of working people to master Chinese characters that are difficult to write, difficult to recognize, and difficult to remember, and in order for the Chinese nation to have a common language that everyone can understand, it is absolutely necessary to implement and promote the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have been liberated, and in just a few years, the face of the motherland has changed greatly. All undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds. When the construction of the motherland is advancing by leaps and bounds, it needs newer science and technology to meet the requirements. Similarly, the level of culture and art also needs to be comprehensively improved. However, no one can deny that there are still quite a few people in our country who are illiterate or semi-illiterate. This situation is obviously incompatible with the rapid development trend of liberated China. In order to make science and technology continue to advance and the level of culture and art continue to improve, only by universally improving the cultural level of the entire country, that is, making the writing system accessible and serviceable to the greatest number of people, can the development of science, technology, culture, and art have broad prospects. At the same time, our country has achieved unprecedented unity in politics, economy, and culture. The people of the whole country are jointly building a great socialist motherland. However, due to historical reasons, different dialects in various places make it very inconvenient to communicate with each other. For example, the telecommunications construction in the few years after liberation has basically connected the long-distance telephone networks across the country. People thousands of kilometers apart can communicate directly with each other. However, if the two parties do not speak the same language, even if the communication equipment is connected everywhere, the divergent dialects separate the meanings that people need to express. The Chinese phonetic alphabet is precisely the best tool for eliminating illiteracy and promoting Mandarin. It will make a great contribution to the socialist economic construction and cultural construction of the motherland.

In addition, as everyone knows, since China began to have telegraph communication, the biggest problem that has not been well resolved in these 70 years is that Chinese character telegrams cannot be directly transmitted. Instead, four digits have to be used to represent one Chinese character. Both the sending and receiving parties of the telegram need to go through a translation process. It is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which not only affects the speed of the telegram, but more importantly, it affects the quality of the telegram. Often, a difference of one digit can change the meaning of the entire telegram. For example, "0823" in a four-digit telegram is the character "喜" (happiness), and "0828" is the character "丧" (funeral). A difference of one digit turns a happy event into a funeral. If a factory sends a telegram asking for copper wire, the code for the character "铜" (copper) is "6894." If it is mistaken for "6884," then the copper wire will be mistaken for "铅" (lead) wire, because "6884" is the character "铅" (lead). There are many examples like this. At present, the machine-based technical terms in telegram transmission work still use foreign languages very unreasonably, and this situation must be changed. After the implementation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, it will first be possible to study changing to using the national language to handle machine-based terms in telegram transmission, as well as other things that can be made more convenient by using the phonetic alphabet, such as the compilation of telegram codes, the arrangement of telephone subscriber directories, and the compilation of bureau names. More importantly, with this set of phonetic alphabets, it opens up a path for research and discussion on the issue of Chinese character reform and provides powerful conditions for moving towards a common phonetic alphabet scheme in the world in the future. Of course, the reform of Chinese characters is a major event related to the daily cultural life of 600 million people, and it still needs to be considered carefully. However, from the perspective of telegrams, if Chinese characters in the future embark on a Latinized phonetic script, it will fundamentally solve the problem that Chinese telegrams cannot directly transmit Chinese characters. This is a great hope for postal and telecommunications workers.

    向工矿区深入  向农村深入
    邮电部部长朱学范谈第一个五年计划邮电建设事业的成就
    我完全同意李先念副总理和薄一波副总理在大会上分别所做的关于国家预算和国民经济计划的报告；彭真副委员长的关于人大常委会的工作报告；吴玉章主任的关于文字改革和汉语拼音方案的报告。
    我现在想简单谈一下邮电工作和汉语拼音方案问题。
    （一）
    邮电工作为建设服务
    一、邮电通信网发展计划超额完成
    二、开展反浪费运动节省大量资金
    三、干部下放工作收到很大效果
    从一九五三年到一九五七年，邮电部门进行了第一个五年计划的建设工作。由于党中央和国务院的正确领导，五年内在各个方面都取得了很大成就。首先表现在邮电通信网的发展上，绝大多数的生产指标都超额完成了。为了适应国家社会主义建设和社会主义改造的要求，邮电部门自办的服务机构的增长，显得最为突出，超过了原订计划百分之六十，到达了二万二千多处，比一九五二年增加了三倍多。许多新兴的工业地区，新设了邮电机构；特别是农村里的服务面扩展很快，一九五七年比一九五二年增加了十三倍之多。现在全国平均每一区就有一个自办的邮电机构，并且还有二万四千多处代办所分布在全国各地。这一情况，充分体现了邮电通信为工矿建设服务和深入农村为农业生产服务的精神。从地区分布来看，还体现着注意了少数民族地区的需要：五年里青海的邮电机构发展了九倍；内蒙古发展六倍；新疆发展五点八倍，新增机构的分布面，大大改善了农村和少数民族地区的通信情况。邮路总长度五年内伸展到了二百多万公里，全国百分之九十八的乡通达了邮路，全国有百分之七十五的农业合作社，已经由邮电局自己的投递力量直接投送邮件了。电信方面，电报电路五年内增加了百分之二十，电话电路增加了百分之三十一，干线电路增加的比例更大，增加了百分之五十六。国际无线电电路比一九五二年增加了百分之四十。市内电话方面，新建和扩建了十六个城市的自动电话，其中九个城市是完全新建的。这些城市第一次使用上了现代化的通信工具——自动电话了。随着农业合作化的迅速发展，较小县城的电话也发展很快，超过了原订计划的百分之八十五。
    邮电部门在第一个五年计划期间所取得的成就，当然还远不止这些，在这里不可能一一叙述。但是，可以肯定地说，解放后短短八年的邮电建设，已经远远超过解放前七、八十年的了。单就设在农村里的邮电自办机构来说，现在的数目，已比解放前增加三十二倍多了。铁的事实，雄辩地驳斥了资产阶级右派分子所谓“今不如昔”的无稽谰言。
    去年下半年，全国邮电企业展开了轰轰烈烈的整风和社会主义教育运动。和运动进展的同时，整个企业，已经开始出现了新的气象。特别是党中央提出了在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的号召，以及“农业发展纲要修正草案”的公布，大大鼓舞了全体邮电职工建设社会主义祖国的热情。国家工农业生产和各项事业大跃进的形势，给予广大职工很大启发，大大鼓起了革命干劲，纷纷投入了：提高质量、改善服务、厉行节约、争取超额和提前完成生产、基建计划的新生产高潮。现在邮电企业的整风运动，正在深入开展，通过大字报、大辩论、边整边改等等，对于改进领导作风，克服保守思想，精简行政机构、紧缩编制、反对浪费、消除贪污盗窃等等燃起了熊熊火焰。不少邮电企业在当地党政的正确领导下，由于广大职工社会主义觉悟的提高，领导人员和群众一起共同努力用算细账挖潜力的办法，为国家节约大量资金。例如北京邮局，从领导到职工，大家共同来检查和修正了过去的保守的计划，他们首先从如何节省运输费用着手研究，发现其中“潜力”很大。原来的计划，从北京到兰州要用一节火车车厢，没有考虑到北京到成都的火车直达通车之后，去成都和西南各省的邮件，无需再走京兰线西安接转了，经过研究，整节车厢只要半节就够了，这样一年可节省运输费用三十多万元。又如航空邮件的运输，原来是平常邮件、挂号、国际邮件都分别各装一个邮袋，经过研究后，用纸套分封合并在一个邮袋内，这样当然减轻了邮袋重量，也就节省了运费，预计一年可以节省十万元。另外从许多方面找出了节约的办法。共计节约的数字，大约全年可达一百七十几万元，同时还研究了加强服务发展业务，预计可以增加生产收入七十几万元。这一实际事例，充分说明了只要克服保守思想，反对浪费，坚决贯彻中央勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针，就必然能够促进工作的发展，使企业出现新的气象。
    自从党中央正确提出“统一安排、全面锻炼”的方针之后，邮电职工的思想认识，有了很大的提高，尤其是部分轻视劳动的知识分子，在实际的教育和影响之下，认识到直接参加体力劳动的重大意义。许多在城市里的，一向担任内勤工作的知识分子，在党的教育和号召之下，纷纷提出走出办公室去做外勤工作，到劳动群众中去。不少行政管理人员和内勤生产人员，改变了过去轻视外勤工作的观念，改换工种去做邮递员或是乡村邮电服务人员。最近沈阳邮局就有五个科级干部走出办公室担任投递工作。干部下放锻炼的行动，不仅表明知识分子思想认识的提高，从而更好地锻炼了自己，同时这种具有积极意义的行动，也受到广大劳动人民的热烈欢迎。
    遵照党和政府提出的多、快、好、省，勤俭办企业的方针，邮电部门将根据一切可能的条件，采取积极措施，来继续提高质量，改善服务，把广大职工在整风和社会主义教育运动中的积极因素，引导到为工农业大跃进服务的新的生产高潮中去。
    （二）
    邮电工作者拥护文字改革一、推广普通话便利各地打电话
    二、电报可用拼音文字直接传递
    三、技术用语可以使用本国语言
    这里我想简单谈一下汉语拼音方案问题。
    吴玉章主任在他的报告中已经提出了汉语拼音方案的主要用途是为汉字注音和推广普通话。为了使难写、难认、难记的汉字，能为广大的劳动人民所掌握，为了使汉民族有一种能为大家都听得懂的共同语言，实施和推行汉语拼音方案完全是必要的。
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导之下，获得了解放，几年的工夫，祖国面貌已经大大改变。一切事业都在突飞猛进地前进着，当祖国的建设事业正在大踏步前进中，这就需要有更新的科学技术来适应要求。同样，文化艺术的水平，也需要全面提高。可是谁也不能否认，在我国目前还有着相当多的人处在文盲或半文盲状态，这种情况显然是和解放了的中国一日千里的发展趋势不相适应的。为了要使科学技术不断前进，文化艺术水平不断提高，只有使整个国家的文化水平普遍提高，也就是要使文字能为最大多数人使用和服务，科学、技术、文化、艺术的发展才能有广阔的前途。同时，我们的国家，在政治、经济、文化上已经实现了空前的团结和统一，全国人民共同一致地在建设着伟大的社会主义祖国。但是，由于历史的原因各地不同的方言，使彼此交谈很不方便。举例说，解放后几年来的电信建设，已经把全国各地的长途电话网基本上沟通了，相隔几千公里的人们可以互相直接交谈。可是如果双方语言不通，即使通信设备是到处沟通的，而分歧的方言，却把人们需要表达的意思隔离开来。汉语拼音字母，恰恰就是扫除文盲和推广普通话的最好的工具。它将对祖国社会主义经济建设和文化建设作出巨大的贡献。
    此外，大家知道，我国从开始有了电报通信以来，在这七十多年时间里，始终不能很好解决的一个最大的问题，就是汉字电报不能直接传递，不得不用四个数码来代替一个汉字，电报的收发双方都需要经过一道翻译程序。费时费事，不但影响电报的速度，更重要的是影响着电报的质量，往往因一个数码之差把整份电报的意思搞错了。比如四码电报中的“0823”是“喜”字，“0828”是“丧”字，一码之差喜事就变成丧事，假如一个工厂打电报要铜丝，铜字的电码是“6894”，如果错成了“6884”铜丝就错成“铅”丝，因为“6884”是“铅”字。像这样的例子是很多的。现在电报传递工作中的机上技术用语，还极不合理地使用着外国语言，这种情况必须加以改变。汉语拼音方案实施之后，首先将有可能研究改用本国语言来处理电报传递中的机上术语，以及其他可以利用拼音字母使工作更为方便的事情，例如电码的编订，电话户名簿的排列，和局名汇编等等。更重要的是有了这组拼音字母，却为汉字改革的问题开辟了研究讨论的道路和将来走世界共同的拼音方案向提供了有力的条件。当然，汉字改革关系到六亿人民日常文化生活的一件大事，还需要从长计议，但是从电报的要求来说，假如将来中国汉字走上了拉丁化拼音文字，那将从根本上解决中国电报不能直接传递中国文字的问题，这是邮电工作者莫大的希望。
