Korean Finance Minister Li Zhouyuan delivered a report on the draft state budget for 1958 and the execution results of the 1956 state budget at the meeting on the morning of the 17th. Li Zhouyuan said that in the 1958 draft Korean state budget, expenditures for developing the people's economy and social and cultural undertakings accounted for 84.7% of the total budget expenditure, of which expenditures for developing the people's economy accounted for 66.7% of the total expenditure, and expenditures for developing social and cultural undertakings accounted for 18% of the total expenditure. Both of these expenditures have increased significantly compared with the planned execution results of similar expenditures in last year's budget. In addition, defense expenditures in this year's budget only accounted for 5.4% of the total expenditure, which is a further reduction compared to last year. Li Zhouyuan said that the 1958 state budget expenditures focus on the further development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of the people's material and cultural lives.
