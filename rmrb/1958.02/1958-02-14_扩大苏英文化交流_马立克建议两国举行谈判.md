Xinhua News Agency, London, February 13th: Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Malik, suggested on the 11th, when meeting with Mr. Mayhew, Chairman of the British Council's Committee on Relations with the Soviet Union, that representatives of relevant institutions from both countries hold negotiations to formulate a 1958 plan for cultural and scientific-technical exchange between the two countries.

    Malik's suggestion was made in a statement he delivered to Mayhew regarding the development of cultural exchange between the Soviet Union and Britain. The statement pointed out that Malik had discussed the issue of Soviet-British cultural ties with Mayhew on December 20th of last year. During the exchange of views at that time, both sides discussed exchanging twenty students, holding art exhibitions for each other, and exchanging theatrical troupes. The statement said that relevant Soviet institutions would study these issues. However, implementing these partial measures cannot truly expand the existing cultural ties between the Soviet Union and Britain. The measures suggested by the British side have long been drafted, but have not been implemented.

    Malik suggested that, in accordance with the method proposed by Chairman Bulganin to the British Prime Minister last July, representatives of the Soviet Union's Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the British Council hold negotiations to formulate a plan for specific measures for cultural and scientific-technical exchange in 1958. The statement said that if the leaders of the British Council are willing to accept this suggestion, the Soviet side is willing to hold such negotiations in Moscow in the near future.

    扩大苏英文化交流
    马立克建议两国举行谈判
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：苏联驻英国大使马立克11日在接见英国文化委员会对苏关系委员会主席梅休时，建议两国有关机构代表举行谈判，来制定1958年两国文化和科学技术交流计划。
    马立克的这项建议是在他向梅休发表的关于发展苏英两国文化交流问题的声明中提出的。这项声明指出，去年12月20日，马立克曾经同梅休讨论过苏英文化联系的问题。当时双方在交换意见时谈到要交换二十名留学生、互相举行美术展览会以及交换剧团的问题。声明说，苏联有关机构将研究这些问题。但是，实现这些局部的措施并不能使苏英两国现有的文化联系得到真正扩大。英国方面建议的这些措施早已拟定，不过一直没有实现。
    马立克建议按照布尔加宁主席去年7月间向英国首相提出的办法，由苏联对外文化委员会和英国文化委员会的代表举行谈判，来拟订1958年文化和科学技术交流的具体措施的计划。声明说，如果英国文化委员会领导人愿意接受这项建议，那么苏联方面愿意在最近期间在莫斯科举行这种谈判。
