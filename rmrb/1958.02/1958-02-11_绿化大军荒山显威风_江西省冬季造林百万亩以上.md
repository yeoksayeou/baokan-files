    Greening Army Shows Great Power in Barren Hills
    Jiangxi Province Afforests Over One Million Mu in Winter
    Nanchang, February 8th (People's Daily) – Along with the great leap forward in agricultural production, a magnificent mass afforestation movement is unfolding across Jiangxi. The barren hills and wild ridges, once rarely visited, have now become battlefields where the mighty greening army displays its power. According to statistics from the Jiangxi Provincial Forestry Department, as of January 20th, 500,000 people in Jiangxi Province have participated in tree planting and afforestation, greening an area of over one million mu. Over two million trees have been planted around villages, towns, and houses.
    Early start, rapid progress, and good quality are the characteristics of this year's greening movement in Jiangxi. The Gannan Administrative Region, as early as last September after the afforestation conference, began organizing forces to carry out forest land planning and seedling preparation. In the first and middle ten days of January, over 170,000 people in the region participated in afforestation, completing 51% of the annual afforestation task, an increase of more than nine times compared to the winter afforestation area last year. Other special districts, such as Jinxian, Yongxin, Guangfeng, Lincuan, Duchang, and about twenty other counties, have completed more than 60% to 80% of their annual winter afforestation tasks. In the movement to eliminate the four pests, collect fertilizer for sanitation, and green the environment, a competition of planting trees around villages, towns, and houses, with the slogan "Everyone acts, every family afforests" has been launched in various urban and rural areas. More than 100,000 people from various organizations, groups, schools, troops, and residents in Nanchang City have planted 220,000 economic and scenic trees on streets, roadsides, and barren hills and wasteland in the suburbs. The people of Suichuan, Jishui, Anfu, and other county towns have cultivated nearly 2,000 mu of pine and tung oil forests and 160,000 scenic trees.
    The development of this year's afforestation work is inseparable from the importance attached to it by the leadership. In order to ensure the quality and quantity of the afforestation task, Gan County has established afforestation committees at the county, district, and township levels, with Party and government leaders at all levels personally taking charge, dividing areas, and going deep into the front lines to supervise and inspect. The county Party committee put forward the slogan of creating "New Year's Day Forests" at the winter production conference, and the county mobilized 50,000 people to afforest on New Year's Day, planting trees on 35,000 mu of land.

    绿化大军荒山显威风
    江西省冬季造林百万亩以上
    本报南昌8日电　随着农业生产大跃进，江西各地正掀起壮阔的群众性的造林运动。从前罕有人迹的荒山野岭，现在已经成为千军万马的绿化大军逞威的战地。据江西省林业厅统计，截至1月20日止，江西省参加植树造林的有五十万人，绿化面积在一百万亩以上。城乡四旁植树达二百万株以上。
    动手早、进度快、质量好，是今年江西绿化运动的特点。赣南行政区早在去年9月造林会议以后，就开始组织力量进行林地规划和种苗等准备工作，1月上中旬，全区参加造林的达十七万余人，完成全年造林任务的51％，比去年冬季造林面积增加了九倍多。其他专区如进贤、永新、广丰、临川、都昌等二十来县，冬季造林已完成全年任务的60％至80％以上。在消灭四害、卫生积肥、绿化环境的运动中，各城乡掀起了“人人动手，家家造林”的四旁植树竞赛。南昌市各机关、团体、学校、部队和居民等十万多人，在街道、马路旁和城郊荒山荒地上，营造了经济林、风景林达二十二万株。遂川、吉水、安福等县城镇群众，营造松树、油桐林近二千亩，风景林十六万株。
    今年造林工作的开展，和领导重视是分不开的，赣县为了保质、保量地完成造林任务，县、区、乡都成立了造林委员会，并由各级党、政领导亲自出马，划片包干，并深入阵地督促检查。县委在冬季生产会议上提出了营造“元旦林”的口号，全县在元旦出动五万人造林，植树面积三万五千亩。（段毅）
