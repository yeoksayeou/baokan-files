Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, February 11th:  Paul Robeson, the famous African-American singer who has been banned from performing by the U.S. government for many years, gave a highly successful concert at the Oakland Civic Auditorium on the 9th.

Despite the rainy day, the audience lined up at the theater doors early to buy tickets.  Because there were too many people wanting to buy tickets, the concert had to be temporarily delayed by half an hour.  A total of two thousand people bought tickets. They packed the entire auditorium. As soon as Robeson took the stage, the audience greeted him with sustained and enthusiastic applause.

In addition to singing English songs, Robeson also sang original songs in Chinese, Russian, German, French, and Yiddish.

Shortly after Robeson began to sing, the audience enthusiastically requested that the microphone be removed. Robeson then sang loudly without a microphone, his magnificent voice filling the entire auditorium. When he finished singing "The Volga Boatmen," the audience insisted that he perform it again.

After the concert ended, hundreds of audience members poured backstage to ask Robeson for his autograph or to shake his hand.

    罗伯逊引吭高歌
    演唱会掌声雷鸣
    据新华社11日讯  旧金山消息：多年来被美国政府禁止演唱的美国著名黑人歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊9日在奥克兰市立大礼堂举行演唱，获得了巨大的成功。
    尽管是个下雨天，听众老早就在剧院门口排队买票，由于要买票的人太多，演唱会不得不临时延迟了半个小时。买到票的一共有两千人。他们挤满了整个礼堂。罗伯逊刚一上台，听众就报以经久不息的热烈鼓掌。
    罗伯逊除了唱英文歌以外，还用中文、俄文、德文、法文和犹太文唱了原文歌曲。
    罗伯逊开始演唱后不久，观众又热烈地要求卸去扩音器，罗伯逊就在没有扩音器的情况下振声高歌，他的洪大的歌声灌满了整个礼堂。当他唱完“伏尔加船夫曲”时听众坚决要求他再来一次。
    演唱结束后，成百听众拥入后台要求罗伯逊签名，或者和他握一下手。
