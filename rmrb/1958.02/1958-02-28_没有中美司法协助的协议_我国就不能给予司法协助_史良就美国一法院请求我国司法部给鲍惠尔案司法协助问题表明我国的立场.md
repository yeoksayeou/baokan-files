Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Willing, the defense lawyer for Powell, former chief editor of the Shanghai "China Weekly Review," has left Beijing today to return to the United States.

Since arriving in China on January 6th of this year, Willing has contacted Louis Ayres, chairman of the Committee in Support of Powell, Vice Chairman Tang Mingzhao, and other committee members to discuss how to facilitate a judicial assistance agreement between the Chinese and U.S. governments. He also indirectly learned about some materials for defending Powell's case through Tang Mingzhao.

Shi Liang, Minister of Justice of China, met with Willing at his request. Shi Liang reiterated the Chinese government's position on Sino-U.S. judicial assistance issues to Willing. In the conversation, she pointed out that in September of last year, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California requested the Chinese Ministry of Justice to provide judicial assistance in the Powell case. This request could be considered if the U.S. government reached a judicial assistance agreement with the Chinese government. However, when our representative Wang Bingnan proposed to the U.S. at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva that the two countries should negotiate on the issue of judicial assistance, the U.S. unreasonably refused. Shi Liang said that China could only provide judicial assistance after such an agreement was reached. The Chinese government's position is firm, and if the U.S. side is truly sincere in requesting China to provide judicial assistance, it should not refuse to negotiate with the Chinese government on this issue.

During Willing's visits to Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, Tang Mingzhao introduced him to Li Dequan, president of the Chinese Red Cross and head of the investigation team on the U.S.'s germ warfare; renowned scientists Bai Xiqing, Chen Shixiang, Liu Chongle, Xin Jun, etc.; members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Weng Wenhao, Wei Lihuang; Shanghai Vice Mayor Jin Zhonghua; religious leaders Wu Yaozong, Zhao Zichen, Ding Guangxun, Li Zhaohuan, etc.; Pu Jin, a responsible worker at the Xinhua News Agency; Alan Winnington, reporter for the British Worker Daily, and other relevant people, Ji Chaoding, Chen Linrui, Chen Bangzhen, Du Gongzhou, and more than forty others.

These interviewees all told Willing that the reports in the "China Weekly Review" by Powell and others about the U.S.'s aggression against Korea and China, germ warfare, sabotage of the Korean armistice negotiations, casualties, deaths, and prisoners of war of the U.S. military in the Korean War, and the corruption and incompetence of the Kuomintang government were completely true and reliable. They said that if there were a judicial assistance agreement between China and the United States, they would be willing to testify for Powell and provide ample evidence; the reason why they cannot provide specific details of testimony this time is because there is currently no judicial assistance agreement between China and the United States.

On the eve of Willing's departure from Beijing, the members of the Committee in Support of Powell reiterated to him that they would continue to spare no effort to support Powell.

    没有中美司法协助的协议  我国就不能给予司法协助
    史良就美国一法院请求我国司法部给鲍惠尔案司法协助问题表明我国的立场
    新华社27日讯　前上海“密勒氏评论报”主笔鲍惠尔的辩护律师威林已经在今天离开北京回美国。
    威林自今年1月6日来中国后，已同声援鲍惠尔委员会主席路易·艾黎，副主席唐明照和其他委员进行了接触，就如何促成中美两国政府关于司法协助协议的问题进行了商谈，并且通过唐明照间接了解了为鲍惠尔案进行辩护的一些材料。
    中国司法部部长史良曾应威林的请求接见了他。史良向威林重申了中国政府对中美两国司法协助问题的立场。她在谈话中指出，去年9月，美国加利福尼亚州北区区法院曾请求我国司法部就鲍惠尔案给予司法协助。这一请求是可以考虑的，如果美国政府同中国政府达成司法协助的协议的话。但是当我国代表王炳南在日内瓦中美大使级会谈上提出中美两国就司法协助问题进行商谈时，美国竟无理拒绝。史良说，只有在达成这种协议后，中国方面才能给予司法协助。中国政府的这个立场是不能放弃的，如果美国方面真的有诚意请求中国给予司法协助，就不应该拒绝同中国政府就这一问题进行商谈。
    威林在访问北京、南京、上海等地期间，唐明照介绍他会见了中国红十字会会长、调查美国进行细菌战的调查团团长李德全，著名科学家白希清、陈世骧、刘崇乐、辛钧等，政协全国委员会委员翁文灏、卫立煌、上海市副市长金仲华、宗教界领袖吴耀宗、赵紫宸、丁光训、黎照寰等，新华社负责工作人员普金，英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿以及其他有关人士冀朝鼎、陈麟瑞、陈邦真、杜公洲等四十多人。
    这些会见者都向威林表示，鲍惠尔等在“密勒氏评论报”中所报道的关于美国侵略朝鲜和中国、进行细菌战、破坏朝鲜停战谈判、美军在侵朝战争中伤、亡、俘和国民党政府腐败无能等情况，是完全真实可依的。他们表示，假如中美两国间有了司法协助的协议，他们都愿意为鲍惠尔作证并且提供充分的证据；他们这次所以不能提供作证的具体内容是因为中美间现在还没有关于司法协助的协议。
    在威林离开北京返国的前夕，声援鲍惠尔委员会的委员们向他再一次表示，他们将继续不遗余力地为声援鲍惠尔而努力。
