Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 30th - Jiangxi Province plans to completely eliminate rice pests and diseases before 1962 to ensure the realization of a great leap forward in agriculture.

The plan requires that in 1958, every county establish large-scale demonstration areas for prevention and treatment, special districts organize joint prevention, and widespread prevention and treatment continue for three years. The prevention and treatment area this year is 7.5 million mu. The prevention and treatment methods are: universal winter plowing, timely autumn plowing, and early spring plowing, and comprehensive prevention and treatment measures using both artificial and chemical methods.

The main rice pests in Jiangxi Province are rice stem borers, leafhoppers, rice thrips, and rice caseworms. According to research by Jiangxi Province's agricultural science institutions, "666" is effective in preventing and treating various rice pests, especially suitable for preventing and treating late-season rice stem borers. Therefore, this year, some rice fields will mainly use the pesticide "666" for prevention and treatment. The experience of Nanchang, Fengcheng, and Jinxian counties in jointly preventing and treating rice stem borers on a large scale last year will be widely promoted this year. Last year, because these three counties carried out joint prevention of stem borers, 310,000 mu of rice fields increased rice production by 17 million jin.

　　江西订出一项新规划
    五年消灭水稻病虫害
    新华社南昌30日电　江西省规划在1962年以前彻底消灭水稻病虫害，以保证实现农业大跃进。
    规划要求1958年县县搞大面积防治示范区，专区组织联防，并连续三年普遍防治。今年的防治面积是七百五十万亩。防治办法是：普遍冬耕、及时秋耕、提早春耕，采取人工、药物综合防治办法全面防治。
    江西省水稻主要害虫有螟虫、浮尘子、稻虱蚤和稻苞虫。根据江西省农业科学机关的研究，“六六六”对防治多种水稻害虫都有效用，尤其适合防治晚稻螟虫，因此今年一部分稻田主要用农药“六六六”来防治。南昌、丰城、进贤三县去年大面积联合防治水稻螟虫的经验，今年将普遍推广，这三县去年因为进行联防治螟，使三十一万亩稻田增产稻谷一千七百万斤。
