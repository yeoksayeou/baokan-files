    Breaking the Old Balance, Establishing a New Balance

    Recently, newspapers have published many encouraging news items: Many provinces are not planning to complete the tasks outlined in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) within ten years, but are instead determined to complete them in five, six, or seven years. Many provinces and cities are not planning to increase their local industrial output by a few tens of percent in the next five years, but by several times. For example, Gansu Province has decided to mobilize the entire population to rely on their own efforts and achieve a sixteen-fold to nineteen-fold increase in the total value of local industrial output within five years, catching up with or exceeding the province's total agricultural output. All of this news shows that the leaders in these regions and departments have broken free from the shackles of old ideas, dare to boldly propose new tasks, and dare to unleash the masses to promote a leap forward in socialist construction. Their thinking has now caught up, so their banner is clear and they are full of drive. This situation is in line with the current favorable domestic and international situation, and also in line with the wishes of the broad masses.

    However, regarding the already arrived situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, regarding the tasks and targets boldly proposed by many provinces, cities, and departments, some people are both happy and fearful. On the one hand, they are happy, but on the other hand, they doubt whether many provinces, cities, and departments can achieve their proposed positive targets, and worry that this will disrupt the balance of the national economy, leading to many imbalances and a complete mess. In their view, being calm and unhurried, developing in a balanced way, is the normal phenomenon, while moving forward quickly, with some ahead and some behind, is abnormal and special.

    Is balance desirable, and imbalance terrible? The facts are not like that. Lenin wrote in "On the Question of Dialectics": "The unity (coincidence, identity, equilibrium) of opposites is conditional, temporary, transient, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, just as development, movement is absolute." The "equilibrium" mentioned here is balance, which is relative; while imbalance is absolute. Chairman Mao also clearly pointed out in "On Contradiction": "In any contradiction, the development of the aspects of the contradiction is uneven. Sometimes they seem evenly matched, but this is only a temporary and relative situation, the basic form is imbalance." In the famous speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao said: "So-called balance is the temporary and relative unity of contradictions. After one year, broadly speaking, this balance is broken by the struggle of contradictions, this unity changes, balance becomes imbalance, unity becomes disunity, and a second year of balance and unity is needed. This is the superiority of our planned economy. In fact, this balance and unity are partially broken every month and every season, requiring partial adjustments." That is to say, for any thing, imbalance is constant and absolute, while balance is temporary and relative, and only achieved under certain conditions. That is to say, it is completely normal for any thing to have contradictions and imbalances in its development, while balance, the unity of contradictions, is a special phenomenon. Some people understand this question in exactly the opposite way, and they cannot help but fall into the quagmire of metaphysics.

    Countless objective facts constantly prove to us that the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, the newborn forces, are constantly impacting old things, challenging old quotas, old targets, old rules and regulations. This is the competition between the advanced and the backward, the competition between new things and old things. In this competition, the old balance must be broken, and imbalance must appear; after the imbalance is adjusted, a new balance is reached, and things move forward. During our country's first five-year plan, whether between industry and agriculture, between raw materials industry and processing industry, or between construction and livelihood, or in general between social production and social needs, many imbalances constantly appeared; however, after appropriate adjustments by the state plan, the imbalance reached a new balance, and the national economy developed rapidly.

    From balance to imbalance, and then to a new balance, this is the law of the development of things. Any thing constantly develops through this spiral repetition of "balance - imbalance - new balance." Objective laws do not change according to people's will, they can only be guided and cannot be arbitrarily changed. If people's thinking violates the requirements of objective laws, they will certainly not be able to do things well, they will only make things worse.

    We have had many experiences and lessons in this regard. Taking the example of 1956, this year our country's socialist construction cause, driven by the high tide of the three major transformations, achieved vigorous development: the total value of industrial output increased by 31%, agricultural production still increased by 4.9% despite being affected by severe natural disasters, and the basic construction completed one-third of the total workload of the five-year plan. This was obviously a big leap forward. However, at that time, some people were stunned by the imbalance in the rapid development of the national economy caused by this leap forward. They only saw some temporary difficulties inevitably caused by this imbalance in progress, and thought that this was difficult, that was difficult, and they were simply terrified. This was because they lacked a correct understanding of the objective laws of the development of things, and lacked sufficient estimation of the party and the broad masses' strength to overcome difficulties, so they wrongly put forward the slogan of "anti-rash advance," pouring a bucket of cold water on the mass upsurge that was developing vigorously at the time. Now, a new upsurge of socialist construction has arrived, and we should accept the past experiences and lessons and adopt correct attitudes and correct methods.

    As the Party Central Committee has pointed out several times, there are two ways to accomplish each task: one way is to make things done faster and better; the other way is to make things done slower and worse. People's two views and two attitudes towards the problem of balance often produce two different working methods. One is a positive method, which is to do everything possible to support the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, promote the growth of new things, and let backward things catch up with advanced things; the other is a passive method, which does not trust or rely on the strength of the masses, does not care about or even suppresses the growth of new things, and lets advanced things accommodate backward things. It is obvious that the former working method can make our cause develop faster and better, while the latter working method can only make our cause develop slower and worse. We should resolutely adopt the former working method and completely abandon the latter working method.

    The two working methods mentioned above, expressed in terms of planning work, are two methods of balance. One method is to take a positive attitude to solve imbalance, constantly raising backward indicators and quotas, making them adapt to advanced indicators, and emulating advanced quotas, which is positive balance. The other method is to take a negative attitude to solve imbalance, always trying to lower advanced indicators and quotas, making them accommodate backward indicators, and emulating backward quotas, which is negative balance. Positive balance and negative balance are two mutually opposing methods in planning work, which are the expression of people's two mutually opposing ways of thinking. To achieve positive balance, we must be full of enthusiasm, pay attention to and actively discover advanced and new things at all times, we must go out of the office, go to the masses, trust and rely on the strength of the masses, instead of just calculating figures behind closed doors.

    In the process of national economic development, we need to organize balance between production and needs, between this department and another department, and between this place and another place. Allowing imbalances to develop freely may cause certain parts of the national economy to become disjointed from each other, which is certainly not what we want, and is not allowed. The superiority of our planned economy is precisely manifested in our ability to constantly adjust the activities of various departments of the national economy, completely avoid the economic crises that inevitably occur in the capitalist world, and accelerate the development speed of the national economy. Our acknowledgement that the emergence of imbalances in the process of development is constant and absolute does not prevent us from organizing new balances. On the contrary, precisely because imbalances constantly exist, we must constantly do adjustment work and organize balance. Here, the center of the problem lies in what attitude and what method to take. Taking a positive attitude and the correct method to organize balance, we become promoters; if we take a negative attitude and an incorrect method to organize balance, we become conservatives, and there is a danger of becoming regressives.

    When discussing and formulating the 1958 plan, we must pay special attention to the issue of how to organize balance. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company provides us with an example. The company's original steel rolling capacity was greater than its steelmaking capacity, and its steelmaking capacity was greater than its ironmaking capacity. When they first formulated the 1958 production plan, they organized balance according to the backward links, and as a result, the total output value could only increase by less than 5% compared to last year, steel output could only increase by less than 10%, steel material output could only increase by 5%, and costs could only be reduced by 3.6%. Later, they mobilized the workers to discuss, determined to break through the backward links, and organized balance according to the advanced links, and as a result, the total output value increased by 8.5% compared to last year, steel output increased by 17.86%, steel material output increased by 11.71%, and costs decreased by 7.2%. This shows that it is wrong to organize balance with a negative attitude and method, and only correct to organize balance with a positive attitude and method.

    Some people believe that organizing balance with a positive attitude will make all aspects tense. This is certainly bound to happen. Backwardness must catch up with advancement, and advancement must be even more advanced, of course it will be tense. Letting new things grow faster and letting old things die out faster, of course it will be tense. But can we be content with our country's economic and cultural backwardness without rapidly changing it? If we are not content with backwardness, we must intensify our efforts and catch up quickly. We must always remember: From the perspective of the international situation, there is still imperialism in the world, they are not reconciled to failure, they are bound to make a dying struggle, we must muster revolutionary drive, compete with them for time, compare speeds, overtake them in industry, agriculture and other aspects, and fully guarantee the safety of our country. From the perspective of the domestic situation, our socialist revolution tasks have not been fully completed, our socialist construction cause can only be said to have just begun, only after decades of hard struggle, when our country's social productive forces are fully developed, can we get rid of the backward state in economy and culture. Therefore, we must carry out socialist construction intensely. The more intense we are now, the less tense we can be in the future; if we are not tense now, we may be very tense in the future.

    For the victory of our country's socialist construction cause, we must oppose vulgar theory of balance, or equilibrium theory, and oppose negative balance methods. Liberated from the ideological shackles of vulgar theory of balance, we will dare to leap forward.

### 打破旧的平衡，建立新的平衡

    打破旧的平衡，建立新的平衡
    最近以来，报纸上陆续发表了许多振奋人心的消息：许多省份不是十年内完成全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）提出的任务，而是决心用五年、六年、七年的时间去完成；许多省市的地方工业，在今后五年内不是计划增长百分之几十，而是增长几倍。比如甘肃省决定全民动手，自力更生，在五年内使地方工业总产值比现在的增长十六倍到十九倍，赶上或超过全省的农业总产值。这种种消息表明：这些地方和这些部门的领导人员，已经冲破了旧思想的束缚，敢于大胆地提出新任务，敢于放手发动群众，促进社会主义建设事业的跃进。他们的思想现在已经赶上前去，因此旗帜鲜明，干劲十足。这种情况，是符合于当前国内外有利的形势，也是符合于广大人民群众的愿望的。
    但是，对于已经到来的工业农业大跃进的局面，对于许多省市和部门大胆提出的任务和指标，有些人却是一则以喜，一则以惧。他们一方面感到高兴，但是另一方面又怀疑许多省市和部门能够达到自己提出的积极指标，并且担心由此而破坏国民经济的平衡，会出现许多不平衡，会弄得一团糟。在他们看来，从容不迫，平衡发展，才是正常的现象，而快步向前，有先有后，就是不正常，就是特殊。
    是不是平衡就可喜，不平衡就可怕呢？事实并不是这样。列宁在“谈谈辩证法问题”中写道：“对立面的统一（一致、同一、均势）是有条件的、暂时的、易逝的、相对的。相互排斥的对立面的斗争则是绝对的，正如发展、运动是绝对的一样。”这中间所说的“均势”就是平衡，它是相对的；而不平衡则是绝对的。毛主席在“矛盾论”中也明确地指出：“无论什么矛盾，矛盾的诸方面，其发展是不平衡的。有时候似乎势均力敌，然而这只是暂时的和相对的情形，基本的形态则是不平衡。”在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这篇著名的讲演中，毛主席又说：“所谓平衡，就是矛盾的暂时的相对的统一。过了一年，就整个说来，这种平衡就被矛盾的斗争所打破了，这种统一就变化了，平衡成为不平衡，统一成为不统一，又需要作第二年的平衡和统一。这就是我们计划经济的优越性。事实上，每月每季都在局部地打破这种平衡和统一，需要作出局部的调整。”这就是说，任何事物，不平衡是经常的绝对的，平衡则是暂时的相对的，而且只在一定条件下实现的。这也就是说，任何事物在发展中存在矛盾，出现不平衡，完全是正常的现象，而平衡，矛盾的统一，才是特殊的现象。有些人恰恰相反地理解这个问题，他们就不能不陷进形而上学的泥坑。
    客观的无数事实却不断地向我们证明，群众的积极性和创造性，新生的力量，时时刻刻在向旧的事物冲击，向旧的定额、旧的指标、旧的规章制度挑战。这就是先进和落后的竞争，新事物和旧事物的竞争。在这个竞争中，旧的平衡一定要被冲破，不平衡一定要出现；不平衡经过调节，然后再达到新的平衡，事物也就前进一步。我国在第一个五年计划期间，无论在工业和农业之间，在原材料工业和加工工业之间，或者在建设和生活之间，总的说是社会生产和社会需要之间，不断地出现过许多不平衡；但是，经过国家计划的适当调节，不平衡就达到了新的平衡，国民经济也就迅速地向前发展了。
    从平衡到不平衡，再到新的平衡，这是事物发展的规律。任何事物经过“平衡—不平衡—新的平衡”这种螺旋式的反复，也就不断地得到发展。客观规律是不以人们的意志为转移的，只能因势利导，无法任意改变。人们的思想如果违反了客观规律的要求，就一定不能把事情办好，只会把事情办坏。
    在这方面我们有过许多经验教训。以1956年的例子来说，这一年我国的社会主义建设事业，在三大改造高潮的带动下，得到了蓬勃的发展：工业总产值增长了31％，农业生产在受到严重的自然灾害的情况下仍然增长了4.9％，基本建设完成了五年计划工作总量的三分之一。这显然是一个很大的跃进。但是，那时候有一些人被这种跃进所造成的国民经济迅速发展中的不平衡状态惊呆了。他们只看到这种不平衡所引起的某些在进步中不可避免的暂时的困难，以为这也困难，那也困难，简直惶恐得很。这就是因为他们对事物发展的客观规律缺乏正确的了解，对党和广大群众克服困难的力量缺乏足够的估计，因此就错误地提出了“反冒进”的口号，给当时正在蓬勃发展的群众高潮泼了一瓢冷水。现在，社会主义建设的新高潮又已经来到，我们应当接受以往的经验教训，采取正确的态度和正确的方法。
    正如党中央几次指出过的，实现每一项任务，可以有两种方法：一种方法是使事情作得快一些，好一些；另一种方法是使事情作得慢一些，差一些。人们对于平衡问题的两种看法，两种态度，也就往往产生两种不同的工作方法。一种是积极的方法，就是竭力支持群众的积极性和创造性，促进新生事物的生长，让落后事物赶上先进事物；另一种是消极的方法，不信任也不依靠群众的力量，不关心以至压制新生事物的生长，让先进事物去迁就落后事物。很明显，前一种工作方法可以使我们的事业发展得快一些和好一些，后一种工作方法只能使我们的事业发展得慢一些和差一些。我们应当坚决采取前一种工作方法，完全抛弃后一种工作方法。
    上面所说的两种工作方法，表现在计划工作方面，就是两种平衡的方法。一种方法，是采取积极的态度解决不平衡，不断地提高落后的指标和定额，使它适应于先进的指标，向先进的定额看齐，这是积极的平衡。另一种方法，是采取消极的态度解决不平衡，总是企图压低先进的指标和定额，使它迁就落后的指标，向落后的定额看齐，这是消极的平衡。积极平衡和消极平衡，这是计划工作中两种互相对立的方法，它是人们两种互相对立的思想方法的表现。要做到积极平衡，就必须充满热情，时时刻刻注意并且主动地去发现先进的和新生的事物，就必须走出办公室，到群众中去，信任和依靠群众的力量，而不是只关起门来计算数字。
    在国民经济的发展过程中，我们对于生产和需要之间，这一部门和另一部门之间，这一地方和另一地方之间，是需要组织平衡的。让不平衡自流地发展，就可能使国民经济的某些部分发生彼此脱节的现象，这当然不是我们所需要的，也是不许可的。我们计划经济的优越性，正是表现在我们能够经常地对国民经济各部门的活动进行调节，完全避免像资本主义世界那样必然要发生的经济危机，并且加快国民经济的发展速度。我们承认事物在发展过程中出现不平衡现象是经常的绝对的，并不妨碍我们去组织新的平衡。相反，正是因为经常存在着不平衡，我们就必须时时刻刻做调整工作，组织平衡。这里，问题的中心在于采取什么样的态度和什么样的方法。采取积极的态度和正确的方法去组织平衡，我们就成为促进派；如果采取消极的态度和不正确的方法去组织平衡，就成为保守派，并且有成为促退派的危险。
    在目前讨论和制订1958年计划的时候，我们特别要重视组织平衡的方法问题。重庆钢铁公司给我们提供了一个例子。这个公司原来的轧钢能力大于炼钢能力，炼钢能力又大于炼铁能力。在第一次制订1958年生产计划的时候，他们根据落后环节组织平衡，结果总产值比去年只能增长5％弱，钢产量只能增长10％弱，钢材产量只能增长5％，成本只能降低3.6％。后来，他们发动职工讨论，决心突破落后环节，根据先进环节组织平衡，结果总产值比去年增长8.5％，钢产量增长17.86％，钢材产量增长11.71％，成本降低7.2％。这就说明，用消极的态度和方法去组织平衡是错误的，只有用积极的态度和方法去组织平衡才是正确的。
    有人认为，用积极的态度去组织平衡，会使得各方面都紧张起来。这诚然是必然要发生的事情。落后要赶上先进，先进要更加先进，当然会紧张起来。让新生事物生长得快一些，让旧有事物灭亡得快一些，当然要紧张起来。但是，难道我们能够安于我们国家在经济上和文化上的落后状态而不迅速加以改变吗？如果我们不安于落后状态，就必须加紧努力，急起直追。我们必须时刻记住：从国外状况来说，世界上还有帝国主义存在，它们是不甘心于失败的，它们必然要作垂死的挣扎，我们必须鼓足革命干劲，同它们争时间，比速度，在工业农业和其他方面赶过它们，充分保障我们国家的安全。从国内状况来说，我们的社会主义革命任务还没有全部完成，我们的社会主义建设事业还只能说刚才开始，只有再经过几十年时间的刻苦奋斗，当我国的社会生产力充分地发展起来的时候，我们才能摆脱在经济文化方面的落后状态。因此，我们必须紧张地进行社会主义建设。现在多紧张一些，将来就可以少紧张一些；如果现在不紧张，将来就可能很紧张。
    为了我国社会主义建设事业的胜利，我们必须反对庸俗的平衡论，或均衡论，反对消极的平衡方法。从庸俗的平衡论的思想束缚中解放出来，我们也就敢于跃进了。
