　　Our Country Has Abundant Fruit Tree Resources
　　Our country is a country with particularly abundant fruit tree resources and a long history of fruit tree production experience. We have more than 300 kinds of tropical, subtropical, and temperate fruit trees, including more than 30 kinds that are widely cultivated and distributed, such as citrus, apples, and pears. Citrus is distributed in 14 provinces south of the Yangtze River and in Shaanxi; apples are cultivated in 18 provinces in central and northern China and on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau; pears, peaches, and plums are found in all provinces; grapes, jujubes, and persimmons are also planted in 20 provinces in the north, central, and southwest regions. In addition, northern regions also grow fruit trees such as apricots, crabapples, hawthorns, walnuts, and chestnuts; central regions have loquats, waxberries, plums, figs, pomegranates, and Chinese torreya; and southern China has bananas, pineapples, lychees, longans, olives, mangoes, coconuts, papayas, gandaria, star apples, star fruit, avocados, sugar apples, jackfruit, guavas, etc.
　　Our country's fruit trees are not only diverse and widely distributed, but also have many excellent and valuable varieties. Excellent citrus varieties include:蕉柑 (Jiao Mandarin), 椪柑 (Ponkan Mandarin), 鹅蛋柑 (Goose Egg Mandarin), Nanfeng mandarin, "Local Early" mandarin, Shatin pomelo, etc.; excellent pear varieties include the Ci pear of Laiyang, the Duck pear of Dingxian, the Jingbai pear of Beijing, the Winter fruit pear of Lanzhou, the Korla fragrant pear of Xinjiang, the Cangxi snow pear of Sichuan, the Baozhu pear of Yunnan, the Dangshan crisp pear of Anhui, and the Dongguan pear of Yangshan County, Guangdong; excellent peach varieties include: Qingzhou honey peach of Shandong, Shenzhen honey peach, Fenghua honey peach, Shanghai honey peach, Chenpu pan peach, Winter peach, etc. In addition, the seedless small dates of Leling, the golden silk small dates, the large dates of Lingbao, the large dates of Anyi, as well as Muscat grapes, seedless white grapes, soft-seeded pomegranates, thin-shelled walnuts, and biennial walnuts are also well-known excellent varieties.
　　Although our country has abundant fruit tree resources and a long history of production experience, the fruit tree industry suffered great damage before liberation. Taking Shandong Province, which has the most fruit trees in our country, as an example, the fruit tree planting area in 1949 was more than 30% less than before the war, and the output decreased by 70%.
　　Since the founding of New China, especially during the first five-year plan, the fruit tree industry has developed rapidly. According to incomplete statistics, since 1955, about two million mu of new fruit trees have been developed in various places (excluding walnuts and chestnuts). In 1957, the total area of ​​citrus and apples was 241.92% of that in 1952, and the total output was 131.35% of that in 1952.
　　With the development of fruit tree production, the content of agricultural production has been increased, and the income of farmers in fruit areas has been increased. From the perspective of fruit tree production in Henan Province, the output value of fresh and dried fruits in 1956 accounted for 6.57% of the province's total agricultural output value. Taking the key counties for fruit tree planting as an example, the income from fruit trees in Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, accounted for 40% of the county's total agricultural income. The Dongdiwan Production Cooperative in Xupu County, Hunan Province, has a fruit tree area accounting for 5.92% of the total cultivated area of ​​the cooperative. In 1957, the income from fruit trees accounted for 45.3% of the total agricultural income, and the average fruit tree income per household was 152 yuan.
　　Due to the continuous improvement of fruit quality and yield, the fruits supplied to domestic and foreign markets have also increased year by year, strongly supporting the country's construction. According to statistics, the export volume of more than 20 kinds of fresh and dried fruits and their processed products in 1955 was more than double that in 1952. In 1957, the export volume of citrus and apples was 540% of that in 1952. The total export value during the first five-year plan could be exchanged for 7,293 kilometers of steel rails (double track), or eight complete sets of equipment like the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Factory.
　　Although fruit production has greatly developed in recent years, production is still lagging behind the needs of domestic and foreign markets. At present, the fruit tree area in our country is about 14 million mu, with a yield of 3 million tons. In 1955, the orchard area in the Soviet Union was about three times that of ours; in 1954, the apple production in the United States was 13.7 times that of ours, and the citrus production was 17.8 times that of ours; the apple production in Japan was 2.6 times that of ours, and the citrus production was 1.8 times that of ours. Our fruits are also in short supply in the domestic market. According to statistics from the Urban Service Department, in 1957, the supply of apples and citrus alone was 140,000 tons less than the demand plan of various places, and the same was true for other fruits. In terms of exports, our country's fruit accounts for a very small proportion of the international market. In 1954, the total world export volume of citrus was more than 2.28 million tons, and our country only accounted for 2.65%; the total export volume of apples was more than 600,000 tons, and our country accounted for 5.16%.
　　At present, the average yield of fruit trees in our country is very low, and the difference between the average yield and the high yield is huge. The average yield of citrus is about 1,200 jin per mu, while the average yield per mu in a large area in Chaoyang, Guangdong, and Huangyan, Zhejiang, is more than 2,600 jin. The average yield of apples is about 1,000 jin per mu. Last year, the Xingfu Cooperative in Yantai, Shandong, had more than 2,000 mu of apples, with an average yield of more than 2,340 jin per mu. Individual high-yield orchards of citrus, apples, pears, and grapes all have records of producing 10,000 jin per mu. Other fruits have similar situations. These situations show that our country has great potential for increasing fruit tree production, and it is very important to develop new orchards and increase the unit yield of existing orchards.

### 我国果树资源丰富

　　我国果树资源丰富
    我国是果树资源特别丰富、并有悠久果树生产经验的国家。我们有热带、亚热带和温带果树种类三百多种，其中栽培多、分布广的有：柑桔、苹果、梨、葡萄等三十多种。柑桔分布在长江以南和陕西等十四个省；苹果在我国中部、北部和云贵高原等十八个省中都有栽培；梨、桃、李子遍及各省；在北部、中部和西南地区的二十个省还栽植着葡萄、枣、柿子。此外，北部地区还栽有杏、海棠、沙果、山楂、核桃、栗子等果树；中部地区有枇杷、杨梅、梅、无花果、石榴、香榧等；华南地区有香蕉、菠萝、荔枝、龙眼、橄榄、檬果、椰子、木瓜、贡皮、人心果、杨桃、鳄梨、番荔枝、菠萝蜜、番石榴等。
    我国的果树不仅种类多、分布广，而且有很多优良品种和珍贵品种。柑桔中的优良品种有：蕉柑、椪柑、鹅蛋柑、南丰蜜桔、“本地早”桔、沙田柚等；梨的优良品种有莱阳的茌梨、定县的鸭梨、北京的京白梨、兰州的冬果梨、新疆的库尔乐香梨、四川的苍溪雪梨、云南的宝珠梨、安徽的砀山酥梨、广东阳山县的洞冠梨等；桃的优良品种：山东的青州水蜜桃、深州水蜜、奉化水蜜、上海水蜜、陈圃蟠桃、冬桃等。此外，像乐陵的无核小枣、金丝小枣、灵宝的大枣、安邑的大枣，以及玫瑰香葡萄，无核白葡萄，软子石榴，薄皮核桃，隔年核桃也都是出名的优良品种。
    我国虽有丰富的果树资源和悠久的生产经验，但在解放前，果树事业受到了很大的破坏。以我国果树最多的山东省来说，1949年果树种植面积比战前减少30％多，产量减少70％。
    自新中国成立以来，特别在第一个五年计划期间，果树事业得到了迅速发展。根据不完全的统计，从1955年以来，各地新发展的果树约在二百万亩以上（不包括核桃、栗子）。1957年柑桔、苹果这二种水果总面积为1952年的241.92％，总产量为1952年的131.35％。
    随着果树生产的发展，增加了农业生产的内容，提高了果区农民的收入。从河南省果树生产来看，1956年干鲜果品的产值占全省农业总产值的6.57％。以种植果树的重点县来看，辽宁复县果树收入占全县农业总收入的40％。湖南溆浦县洞底湾生产合作社，果树面积占全社总耕地面积5.92％，1957年果树收入占农业总收入的45.3％，每户平均果树收入为一百五十二元。
    由于果品产量和质量的不断提高，供应国内外市场销售的果品也逐年增长，有力地支援了国家的建设。据统计，二十多种干鲜果品及其加工制品1955年出口数量，比1952年多了一倍。1957年柑桔、苹果两项的出口量为1952年的540％，第一个五年计划期间出口总值可换回钢轨（双轨）七千二百九十三公里，或八座像鞍山无缝钢管厂那样的全套设备。
    几年来果品虽然有了很大的发展，但生产仍落后于国内外市场的需要。目前我国果树面积约一千四百多万亩。产量三百万吨，而苏联1955年果园面积约为我们的三倍；1954年美国苹果产量为我国的十三点七倍，柑桔为我国的十七点八倍；日本苹果产量为我国的二点六倍，柑桔为我国的一点八倍。我们的果品在国内市场上也是供不应求的。据城市服务部统计，1957年仅苹果、柑桔的供应量比各地要货计划少十四万吨，其他果品也有同样的情况。出口方面，我国果品在国际市场上占的比重还很小。1954年世界柑桔总出口量为二百二十八万多吨，我国只占2.65％；苹果总出口量六十多万吨，我国占5.16％。
    目前我国果树一般产量很低，平均产量和高额产量相差悬殊。柑桔平均每亩产量一千二百斤左右，广东潮阳和浙江黄岩大面积平均亩产量都在二千六百斤以上。苹果平均亩产量一千斤上下，山东烟台幸福社去年有二千多亩苹果，平均每亩收果两千三百四十多斤。柑桔、苹果、梨和葡萄等的个别丰产果园，均有亩产万斤的纪录。其他果品也有类似情况。这些情况说明，我国果树增产的潜力很大，发展新果园和提高原有果园的单位产量都很重要。
