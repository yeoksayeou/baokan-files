This newspaper reports from Shenyang on the 9th: The total output value of local industries (including handicrafts) in Liaoning Province has greatly exceeded the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations. In 1957, the total output value of local industries was equivalent to 162.64% of that of agriculture and sideline occupations. The development of local industries has vigorously supported the development of agriculture, capital construction, and large state-owned industries, supplied the needs of the people's lives, and accumulated a large amount of construction funds for the country.

The development of local industries in Liaoning Province has been relatively rapid, with an average annual increase of 14.6% in output value during the First Five-Year Plan period. In 1952, the total output value of local industries accounted for only 49.1% of the total output value of industry and agriculture, but in 1957, the proportion increased to 61.9%, with the total output value nearly doubling in five years. An important factor in the rapid development of local industries is the enormous development of agricultural production in the province. The bumper harvest in agriculture in 1952 prompted local industries to take a leap forward in 1953, with the total output value increasing by 39.7% over the previous year. The bumper harvest in agriculture in 1955 and the victory of agricultural cooperation in 1956 further prompted the total output value of local industries to increase by 38.8% in 1956. In the past five years, the province's agriculture has provided a large amount of raw materials to local industries, including nearly three million tons of soybeans, more than 17 billion silkworm cocoons, and a large amount of cotton, apples, etc.; during the same period, farmers purchased more than 264,000 new-style farm tools and more than 19 million hoes, picks, etc. from local industrial departments.

Due to the implementation of the policy of local industries serving agriculture, the total value of products serving agricultural production by local industries throughout the province in 1957 increased by 240% compared with 1952. Various agricultural machines are constantly increasing. In 1952, only twelve kinds of new-style farm tools were produced, but now the number has increased to more than seventy kinds. In 1953, more than 740 double-wheel double-share plows and more than 4,000 waterwheels were produced. In 1956, due to the great development of agricultural cooperation, the number of double-wheel double-share plows increased to 94,000 and the number of waterwheels increased to 100,000. The number of diesel engines produced in 1953 was only eighty (1,600 horsepower), but in 1957, it increased to 907 (more than 20,000 horsepower). In addition, the output of large cart steel plates, animal-powered rotary cultivators, seeders, and shovel-tillage machines has increased significantly. This year, agricultural production will have an even greater leap forward, and this new situation is forcing local industries to develop rapidly. This year, local industrial departments plan to improve and trial-produce more than twenty new kinds of agricultural machinery, including steam engines, gas engines, new-style plows, rice transplanters, mountain seeders, potato seeders, and so on. At the same time, it is planned to use the surplus coke oven gas, the discharged nitrogen gas, and the coke oven gas from Anshan to build two large-scale nitrogen fertilizer plants.

Liaoning Province has a good industrial base, with many large-scale key construction projects during the First Five-Year Plan period, and the production scale of state-owned industries is also constantly expanding, requiring the vigorous cooperation and support of local industries, which has also promoted the development of local industries. The local industries in major industrial cities throughout the province, such as Shenyang, Anshan, Lushun-Dalian, and Fushun, mostly serve state-owned industries and capital construction. Local industries supply a large number of building materials and processed products, accessories, etc. for capital construction and state-owned industries. For example, the factories under the Shenyang First Industrial Bureau are almost all indispensable cooperative factories for state-owned industries. The air reservoirs, coolers, and other products produced by the Shenyang Riveting and Casting Factory are all produced in cooperation with the state-owned air compressor factory. Some small iron factories, machinery factories, and riveting factories in Anshan also process equipment and rivet-weld metal structures for Anshan Iron and Steel. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the proportion of products serving state-owned industries by local industries throughout the province was very large, averaging 30% to 35% of the total output value. In 1957, the total value of products serving state-owned industries by local industries throughout the province increased by 184% compared with 1952.

In the past five years, in order to supply the needs of the people's lives in urban and rural areas, Liaoning local industries have continuously increased output, expanded varieties, and improved quality. In the early days of liberation, the foundation of Liaoning's light industry was weak, and the quantity and types of daily necessities were small. With the improvement of the lives of urban and rural working people and the increase in market demand, light industry, the food industry, and the textile industry have all developed rapidly. In 1952, the output of rubber shoes was only 2.45 million pairs, but now it has increased to 9 million pairs. In 1952, the output of leather shoes was only 220,000 pairs, but now it has increased to more than 1 million pairs. In 1952, the output of knitted underwear was only more than 200,000 dozens, but now it has increased to more than 700,000 dozens. In the past five years, more than 2,000 new varieties have been successfully trial-produced. Products that were not produced before 1952, such as thermos bottles, artificial fur, and silk fabrics, are now being produced in large quantities. Liaoning's tussah silk fabrics are well-known in domestic and foreign markets and are now exported to more than thirty countries. In 1952, the output of tussah silk fabrics was only more than 2.3 million meters, but now it has increased to more than 10 million meters. At present, some light industrial products in Liaoning, such as rubber shoes, leather shoes, enamelware, and cotton sweaters and trousers, are already sufficient to meet the needs of the entire province. The proportion of the total value of products serving the needs of the people's lives by local industries throughout the province is also relatively large, accounting for about 60% of the total output value of local industries.

In addition, in five years, local industries in Liaoning Province have also accumulated more than 1.13 billion yuan of funds for the country.

　　辽宁地方工业产值超过农业
    全省生产建设和人民生活获益众多
    本报沈阳9日电　辽宁省地方工业（包括手工业）的总产值已经大大超过了农副业的总产值。1957年地方工业的总产值相当于农副业的162.64％。地方工业的发展，有力地支援了农业、基本建设和国营大工业的发展，供应了人民生活的需要，并且为国家积累了大量建设资金。
    辽宁省地方工业发展的速度较快，在第一个五年计划期间内每年产值平均增长14.6％。1952年地方工业总产值仅占工农业总产值的49.1％，1957年所占比重就增至61.9％，五年来总产值增加将近一倍。地方工业能够很快发展的重要因素，是全省农业生产有了巨大发展。1952年全省农业丰收，促使地方工业在1953年向前跃进了一步，总产值比上一年增长39.7％。1955年农业丰收和1956年农业合作化胜利，又促使1956年地方工业的总产值增长38.8％。近五年内，全省农业向地方工业提供了大量原料，有将近三百万吨大豆、一百七十多亿粒大蚕和大量棉花、苹果等；同一期间内，农民向地方工业部门购买了二十六万四千多台新式农具和一千九百多万件锄头、镐头等。
    由于地方工业为农业服务方针的贯彻执行，1957年全省地方工业为农业生产服务的产品总值比1952年增加了240％。各种农业机械不断增加。1952年新式农具只生产十二种，现在增至七十多种。1953年生产双轮双铧犁七百四十多台、水车四千多台，1956年由于农业合作化大发展，双轮双铧犁增至九万四千台、水车增至十万台。1953年生产的柴油机不过八十台（一千六百马力），1957年就增至九百零七台（两万多马力）。此外，大车钢板、畜力元盘机、播种机、铲趟机的产量都有很大增加。今年农业生产将要有一个更大的跃进，这种新形势正在迫使地方工业迅速来个更大的发展。今年地方工业部门计划改良和试制的新的农业机械有二十几种，其中有：蒸气机、煤气机、新式犁、插秧机、山地播种机、土豆播种机等等。同时计划利用本溪多余的焦炉煤气、被放掉的氮气等废气以及鞍山的焦炉煤气，新建两座规模相当大的氮肥厂。
    辽宁省工业基础好，第一个五年计划期间重点建设工程多，规模大，国营工业的生产规模也不断扩大，需要地方工业的大力配合和支援，同时也推动了地方工业的发展。全省主要工业城市如沈阳、鞍山、旅大、抚顺等地的地方工业，多半是为国营工业和基本建设服务的。地方工业为基本建设和国营工业供应了大批建筑材料和加工品、配件等。像沈阳市第一工业局所属各厂，几乎都是国营工业的不可缺少的协作厂。沈阳市铆铸厂生产的储气缸、冷却器等产品，都是为国营空气压缩机厂协作生产的。鞍山市一些规模很小的铁工厂、机械厂和铆造厂，也为鞍钢加工设备和铆焊金属结构。在第一个五年计划期间，全省地方工业为国营工业服务的产品比重很大，平均占总产值的30％到35％。1957年全省地方工业为国营工业服务的产品总值比1952年增加了184％。
    近五年来，辽宁地方工业为了供应城乡人民生活的需要，不断增加产量，扩大品种，提高质量。解放初期，辽宁轻工业的基础较弱，日用必需品的数量和种类较少。随着城乡劳动人民生活的提高，市场需要量的增大，轻工业、食品工业和纺织工业都有很快的发展。1952年胶鞋产量只有二百四十五万双，现在增加到九百万双。1952年皮鞋产量仅二十二万双，现在增加到一百多万双。1952年针织内衣产量仅二十多万打，现在增加到七十多万打。近五年内试制成功的新品种就有两千多种。1952年以前没有生产过的产品，像暖水瓶、人造毛皮和绢丝织品等，现在都在大量生产。辽宁的榨蚕丝织品在国内外市场都很有名，现在向三十多个国家出口。1952年榨蚕丝织品的产量只有二百三十多万公尺，现在增加到一千多万公尺。目前辽宁有些轻工业产品，例如胶鞋、皮鞋、搪瓷、棉毛衫裤等，已经足够满足全省的需要。全省地方工业为人民生活需要服务的产品总值比重也较大，约占地方工业总产值的60％左右。
    此外，五年内辽宁省地方工业还为国家积累了资金十一亿三千多万元。
