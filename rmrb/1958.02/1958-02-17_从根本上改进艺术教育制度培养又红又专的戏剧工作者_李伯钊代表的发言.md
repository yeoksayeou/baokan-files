Fundamentally Improve the Art Education System to Cultivate Dramatists Who are Both Red and Expert
Speech by Representative Li Bozhao

I fully agree with the reports made to the conference by Vice Premiers Bo Yibo and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and wholeheartedly support the implementation of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme.

Through the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, a great victory has been achieved in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The enthusiasm of workers and peasants across the country has been ignited, and a thrilling Great Leap Forward has emerged on the industrial and agricultural fronts, pushing forward the thinking of each of us almost every moment. Comrades on the cultural front should muster twelve points of enthusiasm, catch up, and will certainly be able to catch up. I would like to offer a few suggestions on improving the art education system:

Recently, in order to rush-rehearse the historical revolutionary drama "The Red Storm" commemorating "February 7th", we sent fourth-year students from the acting department to the Changxindian Locomotive Repair Factory to participate in labor training and perform for the workers. This lasted for eighteen days. Many students ate, lived, worked, and labored with the workers. They enthusiastically learned from the workers, studying their discipline, love of labor, hard work, simplicity, and selfless spirit of loving the factory as their home, as well as their fervent socialist drive. An event also occurred that is worth noting. When a fourth-year female student was participating in locomotive repair work, the master worker led her to climb onto the top of the boiler, stepping on rivets. The higher she climbed, the more afraid she became, her legs weakening and unable to straighten. The master worker, seeing the fear on her face, immediately told her, "Go down! Go down!" The student, her face flushed, was too ashamed to lift her head, feeling that she was useless and so timid. She mustered her courage and climbed up a second time. When she reached the top, she gritted her teeth and stood up. The master worker smiled broadly, immediately gave her a pair of pliers, and taught her how to work. After the work was done, the master worker gently patted the student's shoulder and said, "You have potential!"

The occurrence of this event is very touching, educating the students and also educating the teachers. It teaches us how to run education well and how to cultivate students. I myself have two feelings about this matter: First, as an educator, I feel that I have been seriously derelict in my duties in the face of this matter. Of course, we cannot blame the student's embarrassment. We must first examine how we usually educate students. Have we earnestly implemented the principle of combining physical labor with intellectual labor? Our students do not often go among workers and peasants, so when they arrive in the workers' environment, they feel unfamiliar and uncomfortable, unable to adapt to the factory environment. We usually only teach students how to adapt to the stage, but we do not teach students to be familiar with labor production, familiar with workers and peasants, and familiar with society. Then, if we want such actors to reflect the lives of workers and peasants, create the images of workers and peasants, and serve the workers and peasants, wouldn't there be a problem? This involves a fundamental issue in education—the combination of physical labor and intellectual labor. Only when this socialist education principle is realized can the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers be implemented.

Second feeling: People can be transformed. Participating in productive labor is a good way to transform thinking. Take this student for example. If she hadn't gone to the factory for labor training, she might not have exposed her weaknesses. If she hadn't encountered such an experienced master worker who sharply criticized her, she wouldn't have blushed and been determined to climb up again and start from scratch. The student was fortunate to receive the master worker's guidance. The master worker's method of training apprentices was effective and in accordance with principles. It is clearly much better than ours, while our method of teaching students has the danger of being divorced from reality and labor, which is worth pondering deeply. We must carefully examine in what fundamental problems our education system needs to be reformed.

On the basis of winning the victory in the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the Central Academy of Drama criticized bourgeois ideology and deeply debated the truth of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology." Everyone realized that "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" is a fundamental issue, and individualism is the source of all evils. Intellectuals must accept the leadership of the Party, transform themselves, combine with workers and peasants, and take the socialist road. This has become the guide for all work, thought, and action. Intellectuals in an intermediate state have further leaned towards the Party. On the basis of the students and teachers' awareness of the need to strengthen self-transformation, the intellectuals' demand to participate in productive labor and accept labor training has begun to become a trend. This situation lays the foundation for the implementation of the socialist education policy of combining theory with practice, education with production, and mental labor with physical labor. How should we implement this policy in the future?

First, we should continue to criticize and debate the bourgeois tendencies of only being expert but not red, being divorced from politics, theory being separated from practice, and mental labor being separated from physical labor. We must deeply implant in people's hearts the truth that Chairman Mao taught us: Politics is the soul, politics is always in command, and politics is the guarantee for economic and cultural undertakings, and implement this truth into teaching practice, truly cultivating dramatists who are both red and expert.

Second, we must implement the policy of self-reliance and hard work, incorporating physical labor and production practice into the teaching plan. Engineering schools can have half-day of study and half-day of labor. Can our art colleges start from the following aspects?

1. Currently, in order to correct the past shortcomings of being divorced from physical labor and accelerate the transformation of intellectuals to adapt to the new situation, colleges and universities with conditions can go down for half a year or a year to participate in industrial and agricultural production labor.

2. During the busy farming season of spring plowing and autumn harvest, go to the mountains and the countryside to participate in physical labor. Actively participate in mass cultural popularization work, guide rural amateur cultural and recreational activities, and organize evening parties.

3. In addition to rehearsing some classical plays required for teaching, the teaching repertoire should rehearse a certain number of plays reflecting modern life and regularly tour factories and rural areas to strengthen artistic practice. During the tour, they can participate in half-day of physical labor.

For the above two items, each academic year can be stipulated as the "1, 2, 9" and "1, 3, 8" system. That is, each academic year, nine months of study, two months of participation in labor, and one month of vacation, or each academic year, eight months of study, three months of labor, and one month of vacation. The situation of art colleges is more complicated, and we may make appropriate arrangements according to the nature of the business and the specific circumstances of teaching.

4. The college has now abolished cleaning workers, and cadres, teachers, and students do their own cleaning work, which can cultivate the labor habits of teachers and students and establish a style of running the school diligently and thriftily.

Third, we must continue to strengthen the leadership of political and ideological work and scientific research work. During the rectification phase, the Party and the government strengthened the leadership of the college's Party committee work and improved the Party committee system. The college's trade union and student union were reorganized, and the leadership of the college's Communist Youth League organization was strengthened, setting off a new upsurge in the rectification phase. There was extensive airing of views, debates, and improvements in work. The school style was rectified, and a new scene appeared in the college. The revolutionary enthusiasm of all comrades was aroused, and all teachers and students enthusiastically engaged in the patriotic health campaign. Recently, another major debate on the handling of right-wing elements was launched, once again gaining profound socialist education. We deeply feel the importance of strengthening political and ideological work and the debate between red and expert in art colleges. The method of mass self-education and transformation through extensive airing of views and debates is the best method for carrying out political and ideological work. Once this form of socialist democracy is mastered by the masses, no difficulties cannot be overcome and no problems cannot be solved. Only by humbly being students of the masses and concentrating the wisdom of the masses can we do all work well. The college's rectification movement is continuing and deepening, and we believe that the rectification movement will achieve complete victory.

Many major issues related to teaching reform and improving scientific research work will be further debated. Currently, the college's curriculum needs to be strengthened in two aspects. One aspect is courses related to history, such as the History of Chinese Opera, the History of the Chinese Spoken Drama Movement, the History of Russian and Soviet Drama, and the History of Western Drama. Some teaching and research groups for some courses have some foundation, while some are completely new courses. Over the years, through the efforts of professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants, some courses have outlines or lecture notes that have achieved results. However, these courses have a common flaw, that is, the content of the courses has little connection with the development of political, economic, and cultural thought history. Therefore, speaking of works and writers in isolation easily leads students not to view writers and works from the entire social, political, economic, cultural, and ideological development, and to understand the role and influence of literature and art in a certain historical period, and to understand that literature and art are reflections of the social life at that time. In this way, students cannot understand the laws of the development of literature and art from a historical and scientific perspective. This situation should be improved. It is hoped that scientific research institutions and other institutions of higher learning will jointly study and solve this problem.

Another problem is that after the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, we should devote our greatest efforts to debating and criticizing revisionism in literature and art. Teachers of literary theory deeply feel that their thinking cannot keep up with the development of the situation and urgently need the guidance of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics teachers. Of course, we must work hard and try our best to improve and cultivate ourselves. It is also suggested that the Philosophy Teaching and Research Office of the Central Senior Party School of the Communist Party of China consider starting to cultivate a number of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics teachers. While strengthening the teaching staff of the Marxist-Leninist teaching and research office, add a Marxist-Leninist aesthetics teaching and research group, so that Marxist-Leninist aesthetics can be systematically and deeply spread, which will help to fight against revisionism.

We must resolutely implement the education policy of combining mental labor with physical labor—self-reliance and hard work, and further improve the art education system, which will enable us to spend less money and cultivate more and better quality dramatists to welcome the socialist cultural upsurge.

Please criticize and correct the above opinions if they are inappropriate.

### 从根本上改进艺术教育制度培养又红又专的戏剧工作者  李伯钊代表的发言

    从根本上改进艺术教育制度培养又红又专的戏剧工作者
    李伯钊代表的发言
    我完全同意薄一波、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、吴玉章主任向大会所作的报告，衷心拥护汉语拼音方案的推行。
    经过全民整风运动和反右斗争，在政治上和思想上的社会主义大革命取得了伟大的胜利。全国工人农民的干劲起来了，出现了工业和农业战线上惊心动魄的大跃进，几乎每时每刻都在推动着我们每一个人的思想前进。文化战线上的同志们应当鼓起十二分的干劲，迎头赶上，也一定能够赶上去的。我想就改进艺术教育制度提出几点意见：
    最近我们为了赶排“二七”纪念革命历史的话剧“红色的风暴”，派表演系四年级学生到长辛店机车修理厂去参加劳动锻炼。同时为工人演出。历时十八天。许多同学都同工人同吃同住，同工作，同劳动。非常热情的向工人学习，学习工人的守纪律、爱劳动、艰苦朴实、爱厂如家的忘我精神，学习工人热火朝天的社会主义干劲。也发生过一件值得注意的事情。四年级有位女同学参加机车修理劳动时，老师傅带她踩着铆钉往锅炉顶上爬，她越爬、越害怕，双腿发软，直不起来。老师傅瞅她面有惧色，就马上叫她：“你下去吧！你下去吧！”这位同学满面通红，羞愧得抬不起头来，觉得自己窝囊，竟会怯弱到这般地步。她鼓足了勇气，第二次往上爬。爬到了顶点，她咬紧牙关，站立起来。老师傅眉开眼笑了，立刻给了她一把钳子，并且教给她怎样工作。工作完了，老师傅轻轻地拍拍同学的肩膀说：“有出息！”
    这一件事情的发生，令人感触很多，教育了同学，也教育了老师。它教育了我们如何办好教育，如何培养学生。我自己对这件事情有两点感想：第一，作为一个教育工作者，在这个事情面前，感到有严重失职的地方。自然，我们不能责怪这个学生的窘像，先要检查平素是怎样来教育学生的？有没有认真贯彻体力劳动与智力劳动相结合的原则。我们的学生没有经常到工人、农民当中去，因此，他一到工人的环境就觉得生疏，太不习惯，不能适应工厂环境。我们平素只教导学生如何适应舞台，却没有教导学生熟悉劳动生产，熟悉工人、农民，熟悉社会，那么，假如要这样的演员去反映工人、农民的生活，创造工人农民的形象，为工人农民服务，岂有不成问题的道理。这就涉及到教育上的一个根本问题——体力劳动与智力劳动相结合的问题。只有这个社会主义教育原则实现了，为工农兵服务的方针才能贯彻。
    第二点感觉：人是可以改造的。参加生产劳动是改造思想的好办法，就说这位同学吧，她假若不到工厂去劳动锻炼，也许还不会暴露出她的弱点。假如她不碰到这样有经验的老师傅，狠狠的刺她一下，她也不会脸红心跳，决心再爬上去，从头学起。这位同学获得老师傅的教导是幸福的，老师傅带学徒的办法是得法的，合乎原则的。显然是比我们高明许多，而我们教导学生的方法，却有脱离实际、脱离劳动的危险，十分值得我们深思。必须好好检验我们的教育制度在那些根本问题上需要加以改革。
    中央戏剧学院在整风运动及反右斗争获得胜利的基础上，批判了资产阶级思想，深入地辩论了“兴无灭资”的真理，大家都认识到“兴无灭资”是根本问题，个人主义是万恶之本。知识分子要接受党的领导，要改造自己，要同工人、农民结合，要走社会主义的道路，已经成为一切工作思想行动的指南。处于中间状态的知识分子进一步的靠拢了党。在师生要求加强自我改造的觉悟的基础上，知识分子要求参加劳动生产，接受劳动锻炼，已经开始成为风气。这一情况就为理论联系实际，教育与生产相结合，脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的社会主义教育方针的贯彻打下基础。今后如何来贯彻这一方针呢？
    第一、我们应该继续批判和辩论只专不红的脱离政治、理论和实践脱节、智力劳动和体力劳动脱节的资产阶级倾向。把毛主席所教导我们的：政治是灵魂，政治永远是统帅，政治是经济文化事业的保证这个真理深入人心，并且贯彻到教学实践中去，真正培养出又红又专的戏剧工作者。
    第二、我们必须贯彻勤工俭学，将体力劳动、生产实习纳入教学计划中。工科学校可以是半日学习半日劳动，我们艺术院校是否可以从以下几方面来作起呢？
    1、目前，为了纠正过去脱离体力劳动的缺陷，加紧知识分子的改造以适应新的形势，在有条件的院校，可以下去半年或一年的时间参加工农业劳动生产。
    2、在春耕秋收农忙时，上山下乡参加体力劳动。积极地参加群众文艺普及工作，辅导农村业余文化娱乐活动，并组织晚会。
    3、排练的教学剧目，除教学必须排练一些古典剧目，应该排练一定数量的反映现代生活的剧目，定期去工厂农村巡回演出，加强艺术实践。在巡回演出期间，当可参加半日体力劳动。
    以上两项，每学年可规定为“一、二、九”“一、三、八”的制度。即是每学年，九个月学习，二个月参加劳动，一个月休假，或每学年八个月学习，三个月劳动，一个月休假。艺术院校情况比较复杂，我们不妨根据业务性质和教学的具体情况作适当的安排。
    4、学院现已撤消清洁工，由干部、教师、学生自己作清洁工作，既可培养师生的劳动习惯，又能树立勤俭办学的风气。
    第三，我们要继续加强政治思想工作和科学研究工作的领导。在整改阶段，党和政府加强了学院党委工作的领导，健全了党委制。改组了院工会、学生会，加强了学院共产主义青年团组织的领导，掀起了整改阶段的新高潮，大鸣大放，大争大辩，改进了工作，整顿了校风，学院出现了新的景象，全院的同志们革命干劲起来了，全体师生热火朝天的投入了爱国卫生运动。最近，又掀起了处理右派分子的大辩论，再一次获得深刻的社会主义教育。我们深感在艺术院校加强政治思想工作、红与专的辩论的重要意义。而大鸣大放、大争大辩的群众自我教育改造的办法，是进行政治思想工作的最好的方法。这种社会主义民主的形式，一经群众掌握，没有什么困难不能克服。没有什么问题不能解决。只有虚心的当群众的学生集中群众的智慧才能搞好一切工作。学院整风运动正在继续和深入，我们相信整风运动一定会取得完满的胜利的。
    有关教学改革和改进科学研究工作的许多重大问题将进一步展开辩论，目前，学院的课程需要从两方面来加强。一方面是关于历史方面的课程，如中国戏曲史、中国话剧运动史、俄罗斯苏联戏剧史和西洋戏剧史等。有些课程的教研组是有些基础的，有些是完全新开的课程，几年来，经过教授、讲师、助教的努力，有些课程或有提纲，或有讲义是有成绩的。但是这些课程都有一个共同的缺陷，就是课程的内容同政治、经济和文化思想史的发展少有联系，因而孤立的讲作品和作家，容易引导学生不从整个社会政治经济文化思想发展来看作家和作品，在一定的历史时期所起的作用和影响，了解文学艺术是当时社会生活的反映。这样，就不能使学生从历史科学上来懂得文学艺术发展的规律。这种情况，应该加以改进。希望科学研究机关和其它高等院校共同研究解决。
    另一个问题，在整风运动和反右斗争以后，对于批判文学艺术上的修正主义，应该花最大的力量来展开辩论与批评。文艺学的师资，深感思想赶不上形势的发展，迫切需要马列主义美学的指导教师。当然，我们要努力，尽可能自己提高和培养。也建议中共中央高级党校哲学教研室考虑着手培养若干马列主义美学的师资，在加强马列主义教研室的师资的同时，增设马列主义美学教研组，使马克思列宁主义的美学得以系统和深入的传播，将有助于同修正主义作斗争。
    我们要坚决贯彻智力劳动和体力劳动相结合——勤工俭学的教育方针，进一步改进艺术教育制度，将会使我们花钱少，培养更多、质量更优的戏剧工作者来迎接社会主义的文化高潮。
    以上意见是否有当，请批评指正。
