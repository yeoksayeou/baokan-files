I completely agree with the reports made to the congress by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang respectively. In his report, Vice Premier Bo Yibo pointed out when talking about agriculture that our slogan is "Work hard for three years and strive to fundamentally change the face of agricultural production in most parts of the country within three years." Now, based on the situation in Shanxi, I will talk about how we are fighting to realize this slogan.

(I)
Changing Rural Natural Conditions Enters a New Turning Point

The achievements made by Shanxi farmers in just a few months surpass those of the past few years, decades, or even hundreds or thousands of years. People's struggle to transform nature and turn harm into benefit has undergone a leap forward. Things that were unimaginable and impossible in the past are now being done.

Starting in late October last year, in the rural areas of Shanxi, like other parts of the country, a production and construction movement based on the mass rectification campaign set off an unimaginable upsurge. It turned the entire cold winter into an extraordinary spring. Of the province's more than 13 million rural residents, more than 6.6 million men and women farmers have invested in the production and construction front. From the back of the Taihang Mountains in the east to the hills and ravines along the Yellow River in the west, from both sides of the Wei River in southern Shanxi to the banks of the Sanggan River in northern Shanxi, one can see fighting teams conquering nature day and night. In December last year, I saw many moving scenes in the plains and mountainous areas of southern Shanxi. One day, snowflakes were falling from the sky, and clusters of people on the ground were digging, ramming, and carrying, just like in a battle, tensely. The sound of stonemasons blasting rocks with explosives came from here, and the loud sound of victory reports came from there through the loudspeaker of the drummer. Red flags were flying here, and big-character posters were posted there. The slogans written on the signs were: "The ground is frozen, but work does not stop; snow falls, but the army does not retreat," "Cross the Yellow River, cross the Yangtze River," and other heroic fighting slogans. How can such earth-shattering energy not change our mountains and rivers?

So, what brilliant achievements have the farmers of the province achieved in the past three months? In terms of water conservancy construction, about 400,000 water conservancy projects have been completed and are under construction, which can increase the irrigated area by 8 million mu. Among them, 4.58 million mu have been completed, and 3.42 million mu have not yet been completed, which are expected to be completed before the end of April. In this way, in just half a year, the irrigated area increased in the province is equal to 2.2 times the original irrigated area before liberation for thousands of years - 3.6 million mu, 1.2 times the irrigated area increased in the eight years after liberation - 6.28 million mu, and three times the irrigated area increased in 1956, the year with the greatest achievements in water conservancy construction - 2.7 million mu. At the same time, the original irrigated area of 1.44 million mu has been improved, and 830,000 mu of saline-alkali land and low-lying land have been improved. 9,387 flood control projects have been completed and are under construction (80% of which have been completed), which can protect 770,000 mu of cultivated land, protect 680 villages, and also prevent floods and silt to increase cultivated land by more than 50,000 mu. These are also achievements that have never been made in any year since liberation. In terms of soil and water conservation, about 260,000 treatment projects have been completed and are under construction, which can control soil erosion in an area of 15 million mu, of which the treated area has reached 11 million mu. Thousands of new Daquanshan have appeared in various places. It is estimated that the completed treatment area can reach 20 million mu before the end of April. That is to say, in just half a year, the completed treatment area is equal to 71% of the total of the past three years - 28 million mu, and equal to the workload completed in the whole year of 1956 with the greatest achievements. In terms of afforestation, 1.2 million mu of barren mountains have been afforested, 320,000 mu of mountains have been closed for afforestation, 6 million trees have been planted "around the four sides," 1.5 million jin of tree seeds have been collected, and 17,000 mu of new nurseries have been added. It should be particularly pointed out that there is no tradition of winter tree planting in Shanxi. Many places broke the convention last winter and planted a large number of trees and developed nurseries, which is a noteworthy initiative. In addition, during this period, about 1.6 billion dan of farm manure were accumulated, which is double the amount in the same period last year. The roads, cart roads, and mountain roads built are also more than in any previous year.

So many things have been done in just one winter, and so quickly. Is the quality of the work good? Is it economical? The answer is yes. This large-scale production and construction movement, due to the experience of the 1955 winter production and construction upsurge, not only has more methods for various tasks, but also has a set of management systems, especially a quality inspection system and an acceptance system. Therefore, it not only achieved more and faster, but also achieved better and more economical results. Taking water conservancy construction as an example, among the projects completed last winter, 95% met the quality standards, while in the winter of 1955, only 75% of the projects met the quality standards. The average investment required per mu of irrigated area (excluding labor) is 6 yuan (the total investment required, the members of agricultural cooperatives in the province contributed 45 million yuan. This is more than twice the amount invested by the state), while it was 11 yuan in the winter of 1955.

From the above, we can see that the achievements made in just a few months surpassed those of the past few years, decades, or even hundreds or thousands of years. This cannot but be said to be a miracle.

How should we evaluate the significance of this movement? Of course, just praising "miracles" cannot understand its full meaning. The important thing is not only the amazing quantity, but also the fact that through this movement, people's struggle to transform nature and turn harm into benefit has undergone a leap forward (that is, a qualitative change). Or, this struggle has entered a new turning point. From then on, people were able to liberate themselves from the shackles of conservative ideas and have the strong confidence and rich ideals to transform nature. From then on, people's struggle to transform nature will enter a new stage of high-speed progress from the gradual stage of ups and downs in the past few years. The characteristic of this stage is, as the farmers said, "Things that were unimaginable and impossible in the past are now being done." "From now on, we will be able to stop relying on the weather." These two sentences appropriately express the full significance of this movement.

(II)
Who Said Mountainous Areas Cannot Achieve Water Conservancy

The masses in mountainous areas used the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to create many good ways to find water sources and use all water sources, not letting rainwater and river water flow away in vain. The masses also created various methods to divert water to the mountains according to local conditions. Now, nearly a thousand agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas of Shanxi have basically achieved water conservancy through these methods. The masses also put forward the slogan "Transform 10,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields without spending a penny of the state's money," and run water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily.

Can the face of agricultural production be fundamentally changed in three years? This depends on whether we can basically transform the conditions unfavorable to agricultural production into favorable conditions within three years. According to the progress of transforming nature in the past three months, our province can control soil erosion in an area of 30 million mu every year in the next three years, totaling 90 million mu in three years, which accounts for 90% of the 100 million mu area that needs to be treated; it can increase the irrigated area by 13 million mu to 15 million mu every year, totaling 43 million mu in three years. Adding the original irrigated area, the total is 53 million mu, which accounts for 84% of the province's 63 million mu of food crops and cash crop arable land (5 million mu of pastureland is not included); 12 million mu of barren mountains can be afforested and mountains can be closed for afforestation every year, totaling 36 million mu in three years. Adding the original green area, the total is 56 million mu, accounting for 80% of the province's 70 million mu of forestable area (about 30% of the province's total area). From this point of view, it is entirely possible to fundamentally change the natural landscape in three years.

Here, I want to focus on the issue of realizing water conservancy in mountainous areas. More than 60% of the cultivated land in our province is in mountainous areas. Whether mountainous areas can achieve water conservancy is obviously a key issue for our province to fundamentally change the face of agricultural production. At present, the general public has a relatively unified understanding of the possibility of controlling soil erosion and realizing greening, as well as their speed. The question of whether water conservancy can be realized in the plains and semi-mountainous areas with better conditions has also been basically resolved. However, some people still have a skeptical attitude towards the question of whether water conservancy can be realized in mountainous areas with relatively difficult conditions. The main two questions they cannot figure out are: what to do if there is no water source or insufficient water source in the mountainous areas? If there is a water source, how to divert water to the mountains? In fact, there are no insurmountable difficulties in solving these two problems. As long as the masses are mobilized, there are many ways. In the past three months, more than half of the newly added 4.58 million mu of irrigated area in our province were in mountainous areas, which is a clear proof. The average annual rainfall in our province is only about 400 mm, and the water source is not abundant (of course, it should be estimated that the rainfall will increase after the province is greened). However, the masses in the mountainous areas used the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to create many ways to find water sources and use all water sources. These methods can be summarized into two main points, one is called water storage. That is, using methods such as building small reservoirs, water storage ponds, water cellars, and digging dry wells, not letting rainwater and river water flow away in vain. This must be combined with soil and water conservation work. Yangzu Township in Yongji County adopted the method of building water cellar groups on terraced fields to store floodwater from high places, which can not only maintain soil and water, but also irrigate the terraced fields with the stored water by gravity. The Hongchun Cooperative in this township can increase the irrigated land by 1,000 mu by building 20 water cellar groups (including 600 water cellars). This is a good way to realize water conservancy in terraced fields. The other is to find springs, dig springs, and intercept undercurrents. In the past three months, more than 3,500 places in mountainous areas across the province have found and dug out water springs. It is precisely by using the above two methods that many mountainous areas that were previously considered to have no water sources have now found sufficient water sources. As for how to divert water to the mountains when there is a water source, the masses in the mountainous areas have also created various methods according to local conditions. For example: opening mountain channels by drilling holes, filling ditches, and building aqueducts; laying underground waterways with clay pipes in places with undercurrents; using power mechanisms or animal-powered waterwheels to pump water to irrigate high land; at the source of rivers, drilling holes from the opposite direction of the water flow to connect the source and divert water back, and so on. Now, nearly a thousand agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas of our province have basically realized water conservancy by using these methods. Here is an example. Chenxu Township in Gaoping County was originally a place with serious soil erosion in the Taihang Mountains. In the past two years, according to the water source and terrain, they have used the method of building grape-style reservoirs, honeycomb-style dry wells, and spider web-style channels to form an irrigation network that diverts water to the mountains, turning the original harmful river into a beneficial river. Now, more than 80% of the cultivated land in the township has realized water conservancy. This typical experience is being widely promoted in the mountainous areas of the province. Perhaps some people will ask, is the water conservancy project in the mountainous area arduous and complicated? Can the agricultural cooperative quickly realize water conservancy in the case of lack of investment power and technical power? The agricultural cooperative of Mishan Township in the county answered this question with the fact that they run water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily. After learning the experience of Chenxu Township, they loudly put forward the slogan "Transform 10,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields without spending a penny of the state's money" last winter. Sure enough, after a winter of fighting, more than 11,000 mu of dry land has become paddy fields. The required investment of 20,000 yuan, in addition to what the cooperative can take out of the public accumulation fund, the insufficient part is completely solved by the members' automatic investment and material contribution. And through this battle, a technical team of more than 300 people has been trained. Among them, ten "native experts" have mastered the technology of designing small reservoirs and channels. Who said that mountainous areas cannot be water conservancy? Isn't the experience of these two townships in Gaoping County enough to prove that water conservancy in mountainous areas can not only be realized, but also be realized quickly?

(III)
Low-Yield Areas Can Also Be Transformed into High-Yield Areas

The Jinxi North and Yanbei areas have more than 20 million mu of cultivated land, and the grain yield per mu is very low. In the past, no county exceeded 300 jin in setting targets. Now the situation is very different. The problem that cadres and the masses are thinking about is no longer whether they can reach 400 jin, but whether to "cross the Yellow River" or "cross the Yangtze River." Some counties have already expressed their intention to cross the Yangtze River in ten years. This is not without basis, because in the counties in the low-yield areas, a group of high-yield land and cooperatives have emerged in the past two years.

In three years, whether the face of agricultural production can be fundamentally changed, in our Shanxi, marching towards low-yield areas and changing the historical tradition of extensive planting and poor harvesting and rough cultivation is also a key issue. According to statistics, there are more than 20 million mu of cultivated land in the Jinxi North and Yanbei areas. Before the war, the grain yield per unit mu was only about 50 jin. In the eight years since liberation, although there has been growth, it has not broken through the 100 jin mark; even in good years, it is only more than 90 jin. In such low-yield areas, can they be transformed into high-yield areas? This is a problem that cadres and the masses have not solved for a long time. After more than three months of mass rectification and the great leap forward in production and construction, people's thinking has undergone a sudden change. Three months ago, the ten-year plans formulated by the counties in these areas did not have a county with a grain yield target exceeding 300 jin, let alone the 400 jin target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program. The current situation is very different. The problem that cadres and the masses are thinking about is no longer whether they can reach 400 jin, but whether to "cross the Yellow River" (crossing the Yellow River means that the grain yield per mu reaches 500 jin, crossing the Yangtze River is 800 jin) or "cross the Yangtze River." At the recent county party secretary meeting held by the provincial party committee, the county party secretaries of Wuzhai and Hequ in Jinxi North and Shuoxian and Yanggao in Yanbei District all expressed their determination to "cross the Yangtze River" in ten years. In particular, Wuzhai County has confirmed the combat goal of "10,000 jin county in ten years." Is their determination a wild fantasy without basis? No, it is based. The most important basis is that in the counties in the low-yield areas, a group of high-yield land and cooperatives have emerged in the past two years. Although they suffered from the worst drought in decades last year, Yanggao County still had two cooperatives with a grain yield of more than 400 jin per mu. In other counties, land with a yield of about 1,000 jin per mu of corn and potatoes (calculated at four jin per jin of raw grain) and land with a yield of about 800 jin per mu of millet can be seen everywhere. The original conditions of these high-yield land and cooperatives are not particularly superior. Why can these places have high yields, while other places cannot have high yields? The main experiences of these cooperatives and land in achieving high yields can be summarized into three points: First, these places have done a relatively good job in water conservancy, soil and water conservation, and greening. This has basically transformed the seriously unfavorable natural conditions for agricultural production into favorable conditions. Therefore, it has not only enhanced the ability to resist natural disasters, but also greatly improved the soil. Second, they have changed the old habits of extensive planting and poor harvesting and rough cultivation. In this low-yield area, the average cultivated land per person is 7 mu for the less and 13 mu for the more. Under such circumstances, cultivation is inevitably rough. And the land will only get worse and worse. In order to change this situation, many agricultural cooperatives have implemented a "basic land" system. That is, each cooperative retains about 5 mu of cultivated land per person on average as basic farmland. The remaining cultivated land is gradually planted with alfalfa and other pasture or orchards. In this way, intensive farming can be carried out on the basic farmland, and with the addition of expanding the planting area of high-yield crops and other conditions, the yield per unit area can be greatly improved. Third, due to the large-scale development of forests and pastures, the number of livestock and pigs, sheep has also increased correspondingly. This has greatly increased the source of fertilizer, thereby completely changing the old habit of not fertilizing or fertilizing less for crops in the past.

From the above, we can see that under the conditions of accelerating the transformation of nature, resolutely reforming the cultivation system, changing extensive planting and poor harvesting and rough cultivation to less planting and more harvesting and intensive farming; at the same time, adopting the policy of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry with the main focus on increasing grain production. This is the basic road for low-yield areas to leap forward to high-yield areas. We firmly believe that as long as low-yield areas follow this basic road and work hard for three years, batches of townships and batches of cooperatives will reach or even exceed the target of 400 jin of grain per mu, thereby fundamentally changing the face of low-yield areas.

Since low-yield areas can quickly leap forward to high-yield areas, then we have to revise the province's agricultural development plan, which has lagged far behind the new situation. We are determined and confident to make the province's grain yield per unit mu this year reach 200 jin from 156 jin in 1956 (a better year); the cotton yield per mu (lint cotton, the same below) reach 60 jin from 40 jin in 1957. And this year, 14 counties and cities will strive to reach 400 jin per mu of grain, and four counties will strive to reach 100 jin per mu of cotton. After three years of hard work, the grain yield per mu will reach 300 jin and the cotton yield per mu will reach 90 jin. By 1962, the grain yield per mu will reach 400 jin and strive to reach 500 jin; the cotton yield per mu will reach 120 jin.

(IV)
Conditions for Leap Forward Are Ready, Leadership Must Catch Up

In the current giant wave of leap forward and further leap forward, many contradictions will appear, the most essential of which is the contradiction between advanced and backward. A big leap forward for the advanced will make the backward even more backward. The leadership should adopt a warm welcome and supportive attitude towards the advanced; at the same time, they should adopt methods such as overall planning, strengthening leadership, organizing cooperation, and visiting exhibitions to make the backward catch up with the advanced and make the advanced even more advanced.

Overall, the basic conditions for realizing a great leap forward in agriculture are now ready. However, the key lies in the leadership catching up. That is to say, it is necessary to overcome the phenomenon of leadership lagging behind the masses and it is necessary to make people's thinking adapt to the changed situation. At present, in the giant wave of leap forward and further leap forward, the contradictions between indicators and measures, between advanced and backward; and between balance and imbalance, are prominently revealed. If we cannot correctly handle these contradictions, we cannot completely overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking existing among cadres and we cannot fully realize the great leap forward. Vice Premier Bo Yibo has pointed out the basic methods for solving these contradictions in his report. That is: "Our method is overall planning, strengthening leadership, letting go of mobilizing the masses, and everything goes through experimentation." In our practical work, we must learn to use this mass line working method. When using this working method, we should see that the above three contradictions are interrelated, and the most essential thing is the contradiction between advanced and backward. At present, the contradictions between indicators and measures that exist in many places are often manifested as the indicators are advanced, but the measures are backward. Therefore, it is urgent to pay attention to and grasp the method of popularizing advanced experience to overcome this abnormal phenomenon. The phenomenon of contradiction between balance and imbalance that often occurs now is often a reflection of the contradiction between advanced and backward. A big leap forward for the advanced will make the backward even more backward, which will lead to greater imbalance. What attitude should we take towards this imbalance that constantly appears due to the great leap forward? First, we should show a warm welcome and supportive attitude towards the advanced; second, we should adopt methods such as overall planning, strengthening leadership, organizing cooperation, and visiting exhibitions to make the backward catch up with the advanced and make the advanced even more advanced. However, some people now see the imbalance and do not take these two attitudes, but emphasize balance and fear imbalance. They see more backward things and grasp fewer advanced examples. They seem to be deaf to everything new in the outside world, only knowing how to appreciate their own "masterpieces." These people are precisely the so-called status quo maintainers pointed out by Vice Premier Bo Yibo in his report. They do not understand that in the development of all things, balance can only be relative and temporary, while imbalance is absolute and constant. Balance is broken and becomes imbalance. After hard work, a temporary new balance is achieved, and then the new balance is quickly broken again and becomes a new imbalance. This spiral advancement is the law of the development of all things. Now, in various business departments, there may not be individual people with such conservative ideas. Therefore, liberating their thinking and turning them into true promoters is still an important leadership task for us in the future. However, to thoroughly liberate their thinking, leading cadres must first put in hard work to truly achieve being both red and expert. Otherwise, a detached and empty politician cannot convince others. Therefore, we have decided that leading organs and leading cadres at all levels from the province to the county must continue to adhere to the rectification movement to the end. And on the basis of the rectification movement, we must further comprehensively strengthen political and ideological work. On the other hand, we must also adopt division of labor and responsibility, take the initiative to do it ourselves, and each person should focus on studying and guiding a business. For the great leap forward in agriculture, we are establishing and enriching five technical teams, that is, five technical networks, from the bottom up throughout the province. These are: the agricultural technology network centered on agricultural experimental fields, the forestry technology network centered on nurseries, the animal husbandry technology network centered on animal husbandry health stations, the agricultural basic construction technology network centered on the agricultural cooperative's perennial construction team, and the local industrial network serving agriculture centered on county-run joint processing plants. Leading cadres at all levels must not only divide their labor to guide these businesses and technologies, but also participate in various experimental work with the masses and take the lead in and participate in agricultural technology reform work. Only in this way can we truly stand at the forefront of the movement in the great tide of production and construction and maintain the closest contact with the masses, can we obtain the qualifications to guide various businesses and technologies, and can we mobilize the high degree of socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses with convincing force. In short, we must have the revolutionary spirit of riding the wind and waves and striving for the upstream, and we must also have the revolutionary skills of being both red and expert and adapting to the new situation.

Dear representatives: Let us all, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, face the bright future with full confidence.

If there is anything inappropriate in my speech, please correct me.

    山西农业生产面貌　三年内将基本改观
    争取山区水利化　低产变高产　今年亩产二百斤　三年翻一翻
  陶鲁笳代表谈山西省为实现“苦战三年，争取农业生产面貌基本改观”的口号而斗争
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任分别向大会所作的报告。薄一波副总理在报告中，谈到农业的时候指出，我们的口号是，“苦战三年，争取在三年内，使全国大部分地区农业生产的面貌基本改观。”现在我就山西的情况，谈一谈我们如何为实现这个口号而斗争。
    （一）
    改变农村自然条件  进到一个新转折点
    山西农民仅仅在几个月的时间所做出来的成绩，就赛过过去的几年、几十年甚至几百年、几千年。人们改造自然，化害为利的斗争，已经发生飞跃的变化。过去想不到办不到的事，现在办到了。
    从去年十月下旬开始，山西农村中，同全国其他各地一样，在全民整风运动的基础上，农业生产建设运动掀起了一个难以想像的热潮。它使整个严寒的冬季变成了不平凡的春天。全省一千三百多万农村人口中，投入到生产建设战线的男女农民就有六百六十多万人。从东边太行山的脊背上到西边沿黄河的丘陵沟壑里，从晋南洓水河的两旁到雁北桑干河的沿岸，到处都可以看到日日夜夜在征服自然的战斗队伍。去年十二月间，在晋南的平川和山区，我看到过许多动人的场面。那是一个白天，天空飘着雪花，地上一簇一簇的人群，真像作战那样，紧张地在挖土、打夯、搬运。这边传来了石工用炸药爆破石头的放炮声、那边鼓动员用喇叭筒传出了宏亮的报捷声。这里飘扬着流动红旗，那里贴着大字报。一块一块的标语牌上写着的是：“地冻工不停，下雪不收兵”“过黄河，跨长江”等等豪迈的战斗口号。如此惊天动地的干劲，怎么能使我们的山河不变色呢？
    那末，在过去三个多月中全省农民究竟获得了何等辉煌的战绩呢？在兴修水利方面，已经完成和正在施工的水利工程约四十万件，共可增加灌溉面积八百万亩。其中已经完成的为四百五十八万亩，尚未完成的三百四十二万亩，预计到四月底以前即可完成。这样，只用半年的时间，全省增加的灌溉面积就等于解放以前几千年原有灌溉面积——三百六十万亩的二点二倍，等于解放后八年内增加的灌溉面积——六百二十八万亩的一点二倍，等于兴修水利成绩最大的一九五六年所增加的灌溉面积——二百七十万亩的三倍。同时，还改善了原有的灌溉面积一百四十四万亩，改良盐碱地和低洼地八十三万亩，已经完成和正在施工的防洪工程九千三百八十七件（其中已经完成的占百分之八十），可以保护耕地七十七万亩，保护村庄六百八十个，还可以拦洪淤泥增加耕地五万多亩。这些也是解放以来任何一年不曾有过的成绩。在水土保持方面，已经完成和正在施工的治理工程约二十六万件，共可控制水土流失面积一千五百万亩，其中已经完成的治理面积为一千一百万亩。数以千计的新的大泉山在各地出现了。预计到四月底以前完成的治理面积即可达到二千万亩。这就是说，只用半年的时间，完成的治理面积就等于过去三年的总和——二千八百万亩的百分之七十一，等于成绩最大的一九五六年全年所完成的工作量。在植树造林方面，已经完成荒山造林一百二十万亩，封山育林三十二万亩，“四旁”植树六百  万株，采集树籽一百五十万斤，新增苗圃面积一万七千亩。应该特别指出，在山西冬季植树是没有习惯的。许多地方去年冬季却打破了常规，大量植树，发展苗圃，这是一个值得重视的创举。另外，在此期间，还积了农家肥料约十六亿担，比去年同期增加一倍。修建的公路、大车路、山区道路，也比过去任何的一年为多。
    一个冬天就做了那么多的事，又做得那么快，试问工作的质量好不好呢？节省不节省呢？回答是肯定的。这次大规模的生产建设运动，由于有了一九五五年冬季生产建设高潮的经验，一般农业合作社不但各项工作的办法多了，而且都有了一套管理制度，特别是有了质量检查制度和验收制度。因此，不仅做到了又多又快，同时也做到了又好又省。以水利建设来说，在去年冬季已经完成的工程中，合乎质量标准的占百分之九十五，而在一九五五年冬，合乎质量标准的工程只占到百分之七十五。每亩灌溉面积平均所需的投资（劳动力不计）为六元（所需全部投资，全省农业社社员就拿出了四千五百万元。这比国家拿出的投资数要大一倍多），而在一九五五年冬却为十一元。
    由上可知，仅仅在几个月的时间内所做出的成绩，就赛过了过去的几年、几十年甚至几百年、几千年。这不能不说是奇迹。
    应该怎样来估价这次运动的意义呢？当然，只是歌颂“奇迹”还不能理解它的全部意义。重要的东西，不仅是惊人的数量，更重要的还在于经过这次运动，人们改造自然，化害为利的斗争，已经发生了一个飞跃的变化（即质的变化）。或者说，这个斗争已经进到一个新的转折点。从此，人们得以从保守思想的束缚中解放出来而有了改造自然的坚强信心和丰富理想。从此，人们改造自然的斗争，将由过去几年的有起有落的渐进阶段进入到一个高速度地前进的新阶段。这个阶段的特色，正如农民们所说，“过去想不到、办不到的事，现在办到了。”“从此我们能够不再靠天吃饭了。”这两句话恰当地说出了这次运动的全部意义。
    （二）
    谁说山区不能实现水利化
    山区群众用愚公移山的精神，创造出许多寻找水源和利用一切水源的好办法，不让雨水、河水白白流走。群众也因地制宜创造出多种多样办法引水上山。现在山西山区因这些办法已有近千个农业社基本实现水利化。群众还提出了“万亩旱地变水田，不花国家分文钱”的口号，勤俭办水利。
    能不能在三年内，使农业生产的面貌基本改观呢？这就要看，我们能不能在三年内使自然条件不利于农业生产的情况基本上转变为有利的情况。根据过去三个多月改造自然的前进速度来计算，我省在今后三年内，每年可以治理水土流失面积三千万亩，三年合计为九千万亩，即占需要治理面积一亿亩的百分之九十；每年可以增加灌溉面积一千三百万亩至一千五百万亩，三年共可增加四千三百万亩，加上原有的灌溉面积，共为五千三百万亩，即占全省粮食作物和经济作物耕地面积六千三百万亩（五百万亩牧草地不包括在内）的百分之八十四；每年可以荒山造林和封山育林一千二百万亩，三年合计三千六百万亩，加上原有的绿化面积，共为五千六百万亩，占全省宜林面积七千万亩（约占全省总面积的百分之三十）的百分之八十。由此看来，三年基本改变自然面貌是完全有可能的。
    在这里，我想着重谈一下在山区实现水利化的问题。我省有百分之六十以上的耕地是在山区。山区能否实现水利化，显然是我省使农业生产面貌基本改观的一个带有关键性的问题。现在，一般人对于控制水土流失和实现绿化的可能性问题以及它们的速度问题，已经有了比较一致的认识。对于平川地区和条件较好的半山区能否实现水利化的问题，也基本上解决了。但是，在条件比较困难的山区能否实现水利化的问题，有些人却还抱着将信将疑的态度。他们想不通的问题主要有两个，即：在山区没有水源或者水源不足怎么办？有了水源，又如何引水上山？其实，这两个问题的解决并没有什么不可克服的困难。只要群众发动起来了，办法多得很。在过去的三个月中，我省在新增加的四百五十八万亩灌溉面积中，在山区的就占半数以上，这就是一个明证。我省每年平均降雨量只有四百公厘左右，水源是不算充足的（当然，应该估计到，全省实现绿化后，降雨量是会增加的）。但是，山区群众却用愚公移山的精神创造出许许多多寻找水源和利用一切水源的办法。这些办法归纳起来，主要有两个，一个叫做蓄水。就是用修建小型水库、蓄水池、水窖和打旱井等办法，不让雨水、河水白白流走。这就必须和水土保持工作结合起来进行。永济县阳祖乡采取在梯田上修建水窖群的办法，蓄积来自高处的洪水，既可保持水土，又可把蓄起来的水自流灌溉到梯田里。这个乡的红春社，修成二十个水窖群（包括六百个水窖）即可增加水浇地一千亩。这是梯田水利化的一个好办法。另一个叫做找泉，挖泉，截潜流。全省在过去三个月中，就在山区三千五百多处地方发现和挖出了水泉。正是用了以上这两个办法，许多山区过去被认为没有水源的地方，现在都找到了充足的水源。至于有了水源又如何引水上山呢？山区群众也因地制宜地创造出了多种多样的办法。例如：用打洞、填沟、架渡槽等办法开转山渠道；在有潜流的地方，用缸管铺设地下水道；用动力机构或畜力水车抽水灌溉高地；在河流的发源处，从水流的相反方向，打洞通源，引水倒流，等等。现在我省山区就是用这些办法，已有近千个农业社基本上实现了水利化。这里举一个例子来说。高平县陈塸乡原来是太行山上水土流失很严重的地方。最近两年来，他们根据水源和地形，用修葡萄式的水库，蜂窝式的旱井，蛛网式的渠道，形成引水上山的灌溉网，使原来的害河完全变成了利河，现在全乡百分之八十以上的耕地已经实现了水利化。这个典型经验，正在全省山区普遍推广。也许有人会问，山区水利工程艰巨复杂，农业社在缺乏投资力量和技术力量的情况下，能够很快实现水利化吗？该县米山乡的农业社用勤俭办水利的事实回答了这个问题。他们在学习了陈塸乡的经验之后，去年冬季响亮地提出了“万亩旱地变水田，不花国家分文钱”的口号。果然不错，经过一个冬天的战斗，一万一千多亩旱地变成水田了。所需要的投资二万元，除了社内从公积金中可能拿出的以外，不足的部分完全由社员自动投资献料解决了。并且经过这次战斗，锻炼出了一支包括有三百多人的技术队伍。其中有十个“土专家”已经掌握了设计小型水库和渠道的技术。谁说山区不能水利化？难道高平县这两个乡的经验还不足以证明山区水利化不但能够实现，而且能够很快地实现吗？

    低产区也能变成高产区
    晋西北和雁北地区有二千多万亩耕地，粮食亩产量很低，过去订指标没有一个县超过三百斤。现在情况则大不同，干部和群众所想的问题已经不是能不能达到四百斤，而是“过黄河”还是“跨长江”的问题。有的县已经表示要十年跨长江。这并不是没有根据的，因为在低产区的各县里，最近两年都出现一批高额丰产地和社。
    在三年内，能不能使农业生产的面貌基本改观，在我们山西来说，向低产区进军，改变广种薄收和耕作粗放的历史传统，也是一个带有关键性的问题。据统计，在晋西北和雁北地区，有二千多万亩耕地，战前粮食单位亩产量，只有五十斤左右。解放以来的八年中，虽有增长，但还没有突破一百斤这个关；好年成也不过九十多斤。在这样的低产地区，能不能变成高产地区呢？这是干部和群众长期以来没有解决了的问题。经过三个多月全民整风和生产建设大跃进的具体实践，人们的思想发生了一个突变。在三个月以前，这些地区的各个县所拟定的十年规划，粮食亩产指标没有一个县超过三百斤，更不必说全国农业发展纲要所规定的四百斤的指标了。现在的情况却大不相同了。干部和群众所想的问题已经不是能不能达到四百斤的问题，而是“过黄河”（过黄河是指亩产粮食达到五百斤，跨长江是八百斤）还是“跨长江”的问题。在最近省委召开的县委书记会议上，晋西北的五寨、河曲，雁北区的朔县、阳高等四个县的县委书记，都表示了十年“跨长江”的决心。特别是五寨县已经肯定了“十年千斤县”的战斗目标。他们的这种决心是不是没有根据的胡思乱想呢？不，是有根据的。最重要的根据是：在低产区的各县里，最近两年来，都出现了一批高额丰产的地和社。去年虽然遭受到几十年来未有的旱灾，但是，阳高县还出现了两个粮食亩产四百斤以上的社。在其他各县玉茭、山药蛋（按四斤折一斤原粮计）亩产千斤左右的地，谷子亩产八百斤左右的地，也到处都可以见到。这些高额丰产的地和社，原来的条件并无特殊优越之处。为什么在这里能够高额丰产，而在其他的地方不能高额丰产呢？总结这些社和地得以高额丰产的主要经验有三：第一，这些地方的水利、水土保持、绿化等项工作都做得比较好。这就把自然条件对农业生产严重不利的情况，基本上转变成为有利的情况。因而不但增强了抵御自然灾害的能力，而且土壤也有了很大的改良。第二，改变了广种薄收、耕作粗放的旧习惯。在这个低产区里，耕地按人口平均，每人少者七亩，多者十三亩。在这种情况下，耕作必然粗放。而土地只会越种越坏。为了改变这种情况，许多农业社实行了“基本地”制度。即每个社按人口平均每人留种五亩左右的耕地作为基本农田。其余的耕地逐步种植苜蓿和其它牧草或果木园。这样，在基本农田上就可以做到精耕细作，再加上扩大高产作物的种植面积等条件，就可以大大提高单位面积产量。第三，由于大量发展了树林和牧草，牲畜和猪、羊相应地大量发展起来了。这就大大增加了肥料的来源，从而彻底改变了过去农作物不施肥、少施肥的旧习惯。
    由上可知，在加速改造自然的条件下，坚决地改革耕作制度，变广种薄收、耕作粗放为少种多收、精耕细作；同时，采取以增产粮食为主的农林牧全面发展的方针。这就是低产区向高产区飞跃前进的基本道路。我们坚信，低产区只要沿着这条基本道路，苦战三年，必将有成批的乡、成批的社，达到甚至超过粮食亩产四百斤的指标，从而使低产区的面貌基本改观。
    既然低产区能够迅速地向高产区跃进，那末，我们就不能不重新修改已经远远落后于新形势的全省农业发展的规划。我们有决心有
  信心，使今年全省的粮食单位亩产量，由一九五六年（年成较好）的一百五十六斤达到二百斤；棉花亩产（皮棉，下同），由一九五七年的四十斤达到六十斤。并且今年有十四个县、市粮食亩产要争取达到四百斤，四个县棉花亩产要争取达到一百斤。经过三年苦战之后，粮食亩产达到三百斤，棉花亩产达到九十斤。到一九六二年粮食亩产达到四百斤，争取达到五百斤；棉花亩产达到一百二十斤。

    跃进条件具备领导要赶上去
    在当前跃进再跃进的巨浪中，会出现许多矛盾，最本质的是先进和落后的矛盾。先进者大跃进就显得落后者更加落后。领导方面对先进者应该采取热烈欢迎和支持态度；同时应该采取全面规划，加强领导，组织协作和参观展览等方法，使落后赶上先进，使先进更先进。
    总起来看，现在实现农业大跃进的基本条件已经具备了。然而，决定的关键还在于领导要赶上去。这就是说，必须克服领导落后于群众的现象，必须使人们的思想适应变化了的情况。当前在跃进再跃进的巨浪中，指标和措施之间的矛盾，先进和落后之间的矛盾；平衡和不平衡之间的矛盾，都突出地显露出来了。如果我们不能正确地处理这些矛盾，就不能彻底克服干部中存在的右倾保守思想，就不能全面地实现大跃进。解决这些矛盾的基本方法，薄一波副总理在报告中已经指出了。这就是：“我们的方法是全面规划，加强领导，放手发动群众，一切经过试验。”我们在实际工作中，必须学会运用这个群众路线的工作方法。在运用这个工作方法的时候，应该看到，上述的三种矛盾，是互相有联系的，而最本质的东西是先进和落后的矛盾。目前，不少地方存在的指标和措施之间的矛盾，常常表现为指标是先进的，而措施却是落后的。因此用推广先进经验的办法，来克服这种不正常现象是迫切需要注意抓紧的。而现在经常发生的平衡和不平衡之间的矛盾现象，又往往是先进和落后相矛盾的反映。先进者向前有了大跃进，就显得落后者更加落后，这就会出现更大的不平衡现象。我们对于这种由于大跃进而不断出现的不平衡现象，应该采取什么样的态度呢？第一对先进者应该表现热烈的欢迎的支持的态度；第二应该采取全面规划，加强领导，组织协作和参观展览等项方法，使落后者赶上先进者，先进者更加先进。可是现在有些人看到出现了不平衡现象，却不是采取这两种态度，而是强调平衡，惧怕不平衡。看落后面多，抓先进典型少。他们对外界的一切新鲜事物，仿佛是两耳不闻窗外事，只知欣赏自己的“杰作”。这种人正是薄一波副总理在报告中指出的所谓现状维持派。他们不懂得一切事物的发展，平衡只能是相对的、暂时的，而不平衡则是绝对的经常的。平衡被突破变为不平衡。经过努力，达到暂时的新的平衡接着新的平衡很快又被突破，又变为新的不平衡，如此螺旋式地前进，正是一切事物发展的规律。现在，在各种业务部门中，像有这样保守思想的人可能不是个别的。因此，解放他们的思想，使他们转变为真正的促进派，这仍然是今后我们的一个重要的领导任务。然而，要使他们的思想得到彻底解放，领导干部就必须首先下苦功真正做到又红又专。否则，一个脱离实际的空头政治家是不能说服别人的。因此，我们已经决定，从省到县的各级领导机关和领导干部，一方面必须把整风运动继续坚持到底。并且必须在整风运动的基础上，进一步地全面地加强政治思想工作。另一方面，还必须采取分工负责，亲自动手，每人着重钻研和指导一门业务。为了农业的大跃进，我们正在全省范围内，从下到上建立和充实五支技术队伍，也即五个技术网。这就是：以农业试验田为中心的农业技术网，以苗圃为中心的林业技术网，以畜牧保健站为中心的畜牧技术网，以农业社常年建设队为中心的农业基本建设技术网，以县营联合加工厂为中心的服务农业的地方工业网。各级领导干部，不但要分工指导这些业务和技术，而且必须同群众一道，亲自参加各种试验工作，亲自带头和参加农业技术改革的工作。只有这样，才能在生产建设的大浪潮中真正站在运动的前列而又同群众保持最紧密的联系，才能取得指导各种业务和技术的资格，才能确有说服力地调动起广大干部和群众的高度的社会主义积极性。总之，我们既要有乘风破浪，力争上游的革命干劲，又要有又红又专，适应新形势的革命本领。
    各位代表：让我们大家在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，满怀信心地向着美好的未来。
    我的发言，如有不妥之处，请予指正。
