    One Season of Late Japonica Rice Yields Eight Hundred Jin Per Mu
    Xishui County Mobilizes the Masses to Summarize Experiences and Strive for Higher Yields
    (Our dispatch) Xishui County, Hubei Province, planted 280,000 mu of one season late Japonica rice last year, with an average yield of 800 jin per mu. Among them, more than 41,000 mu averaged over 1,000 jin per mu, and 3,526 mu averaged over 1,300 jin per mu. The Samsung Cooperative in Lanxi Township had five mu with an average yield of 2,650 jin.
    Xishui County began planting one season of late Japonica rice in 1955. Two years ago, the county's rice cultivation system was still a single season of mid-season Indica rice, and the average yield per mu had never exceeded 600 jin. In the spring of 1955, one season of late Japonica (Lao Lai Qing variety) was introduced, and the county farm and several agricultural cooperatives jointly trial-planted 18 mu. That year, the yield was over 700 jin per mu, which was more than 120 jin higher than the yield of mid-season rice in the same year. In 1956, after the county achieved cooperativization, it was promoted to 160,000 mu, accounting for 26.9% of the rice area that year; last year, it was expanded to 280,000 mu, accounting for 46.4% of the rice area.
    The large-scale increase in production of one season of late Japonica rice in Xishui County is mainly due to the gradual mastery of the characteristics and cultivation techniques of one season of late Japonica rice during the development process from point to area, and the grasping of several key technical measures: paying attention to fertilization from beginning to end, rational close planting, and sparse sowing to cultivate strong seedlings.
    In the second half of last year, the county party committee again mobilized the masses to conduct a mass summary and appraisal of one season of late Japonica rice, further improving and developing the original cultivation techniques to strive for higher yields in 1958.

    一季晚粳稻亩产八百斤
    浠水县正发动群众总结经验争取更高产量
    本报讯　湖北浠水县去年种植了二十八万亩一季晚粳稻平均亩产八百斤，其中有四万一千多亩平均亩产一千斤以上，三千五百二十六亩平均亩产一千三百斤以上，兰溪乡三星社有五亩平均亩产二千六百五十斤。
    浠水县种植一季晚粳稻是从1955年开始的。两年前全县水稻栽培制度还是单一的一季中熟秈稻，每亩平均产量一直没有突破六百斤。1955年春开始引进了一季晚粳（老来青）品种，由县农场和几个农业社共试种了十八亩，当年亩产七百多斤，比同年中稻亩产量高出一百二十多斤。1956年全县实现了合作化以后就推广到十六万亩，占当年水稻面积的26.9％；去年又扩大到二十八万亩，占水稻面积的46.4％。
    一季晚粳稻在浠水县获得大面积增产，主要是在由点到面的发展过程中，逐步掌握了一季晚粳稻的特性和栽培技术，抓住了突出的几项主要技术措施：自始至终注意施肥、合理密植和稀下种培育壮秧。
    去年下半年县委又发动群众对一季晚粳稻再一次进行群众性的总结鉴定，进一步改进和发展原有栽培技术，争取1958年的更高产量。
