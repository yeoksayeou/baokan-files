　　Agricultural Technology Reform Must Keep Up
　　Tian Lianqian
　　Since winter, the work of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation has advanced by leaps and bounds. Water conservancy projects and fertilizers in each region have increased substantially, and are continuing to increase. This is an important material foundation for achieving a leap forward in agricultural production. But this is not enough. In order to guarantee the leap forward in agricultural production, it is also necessary to organize large-scale agricultural technology reform.
　　The level of agricultural production in our country is still very backward, and the yield per unit area is still relatively low, which is closely related to extensive cultivation and backward production technology. To fundamentally realize the revolution in agricultural production technology and build a completely modern agriculture requires many years. But this does not mean that before industry can supply a large amount of modern machinery, chemical fertilizers, fuel, and electricity, we have nothing to do in terms of reforming agricultural technology. In fact, under the current conditions, we have many advanced production technologies that urgently need to be promoted. These advanced technologies that have been tested by production practice are an important aspect of the huge potential for increased production. The reason why some regions and cooperatives have been able to significantly increase production and reach the increased production targets stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program several years in advance is that they have vigorously promoted effective technical measures and created new production technologies in practice. We should apply and promote all advanced production technologies as valuable assets.
　　Judging from the current situation, after a substantial increase in water conservancy projects and fertilizers, the reform of production technology lags behind the requirements of the production leap forward, which is prominent. This is a contradiction that remains to be resolved. For example, a large number of water conservancy projects have been added, but the technology of rational irrigation has not been paid attention to and promoted. This will waste water, weaken drought resistance, and may also cause soil alkalization and damage the land. A large amount of fertilizer has been added, but the technology of rational fertilization, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation has not been universally promoted, which will weaken the fertilizer efficiency. At the same time, with sufficient irrigation water and fertilizer, it is also necessary to increase the multiple cropping index, rational close planting, rational crop rotation, and improve field management, so that the leap forward in agricultural production will be reliably guaranteed. Therefore, we cannot be complacent because of the great achievements in water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, and ignore the attention to technological reform.
　　The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee recently held a meeting, requesting that while the work of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation leaps forward, a leap forward should also be promoted in terms of technological reform. This is very necessary. This issue should attract universal attention in all regions. Agricultural technology reform should be a part of the agricultural production plan, and there should be indicators, inspections, and summaries. It is not far from spring plowing. Which advanced technologies will be promoted this year, how to promote them, and in what scope, these issues should now be studied, planned and prepared. The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to hand over the issue of technological reform to grassroots cadres and commune members for debate, and to solve ideological problems through debate to prevent coercion, commandism, subjectivism, and formalism. This also requires universal attention.

　　农业技术改革要跟上来
　　田连阡
    冬季以来，兴修水利和积肥的工作突飞猛进，每个地区的水利工程和肥料都大量增加了，并且还在继续增加着。这是实现农业生产跃进的重要物质基础。但是这还不够，为了保证农业生产的跃进，同时还需要组织大规模的农业技术改革。
    我国目前农业生产水平还很落后，单位面积产量还比较低，这同耕作的粗放和生产技术的落后有密切关系。要从根本上实现农业生产技术的革命，建设完全现代化的农业，这需要许多年的时间。但这并不是说，在工业能够供应大量的现代化的机械、化学肥料、燃料、电力以前，我们在革新农业技术方面就无事可做。事实上，在目前的条件下，我们就有许多进步的生产技术急需推广。这些已为生产实践所检验过的先进技术，是巨大的增产潜力中一个重要方面。有些地区和合作社所以能够显著增产，提前若干年达到农业发展纲要所规定的增产指标，原因之一就是它们大力推广了行之有效的技术措施，同时在实践中创造了新的生产技术。我们应当使一切先进的生产技术当做宝贵的财富，加以应用和推广。
    从当前的形势看，在水利工程和肥料大量增加以后，生产技术上的改革落后于生产跃进的要求，就显得突出了。这是一个尚待解决的矛盾。比如说水利工程大量增加了，而合理灌溉的技术却还没有注意推广，这就会浪费用水，减弱抗旱能力，还可能造成土壤的碱化，破坏地力。肥料大量增加了，却没有普遍推广合理施肥、深耕细作的技术，这就会减弱肥效。同时，有了充足的灌溉用水和肥料，也还需要提高复种指数、合理密植、合理轮作、改善田间管理，农业生产的跃进才会有可靠保证。所以，我们不能因为水利和积肥有了很大成绩就自满起来，忽视了对技术改革的注意。
    广东省委最近召开会议，要求在水利、积肥工作跃进的同时，推动技术改革方面也来一个跃进。这是很必要的。这个问题应当引起各地的普遍注意。农业技术改革应当成为农业生产计划的一部分，应当有指标，有检查，有总结。现在离春耕已经不远了，今年要推广哪些先进技术，怎样推广，在多大范围内推广，这些问题现在就应当着手来研究、计划和准备了。广东省委要求各地把技术改革问题交给基层干部和社员群众辩论，通过辩论解决思想认识问题，防止强迫命令和主观主义、形式主义，这也是需要普遍注意的。
