How to Make the Down-to-the-Countryside Gas Engine Good and Economical
Representative Lu Jingyun Offers Specific Suggestions

This year, the construction of farmland water conservancy across the country is being carried out on a large scale with a high tide, and the need for drainage and irrigation machinery is also increasing substantially. According to the national economic plan for this year, the country will increase its agricultural drainage and irrigation machinery by 500,000 horsepower. According to information from the relevant departments of the Ministry of Water Resources, the demand from rural areas across the country reaches more than 1 million horsepower. The currently arranged production figures are already close to 700,000 horsepower. Moreover, due to the correct policy put forward by the leadership to develop more gas engines, the increase in gas engines this year accounts for the largest proportion of various power machines, between 380,000 and 500,000 horsepower, accounting for 70 percent of the total number of power machines. This is an unprecedented development of gas engines. We celebrate the huge economic effects that this development will bring, and we should also make every effort to ensure these economic effects.

Gas Engines Have Several Characteristics and Minimum Requirements - Attention Must Be Paid During Planning to Avoid Detours

In the past, Chinese farmers, especially in the North China region, had very little contact with power machinery. This year, such a large number of gas engines going down to the countryside will be the pioneers of power machinery in many rural areas. Among various power machines, gas engines have the highest economic value and the advantage of being most suitable for China's fuel resources. However, their use and management have several characteristics and minimum requirements that must be taken into account during planning to avoid detours at the beginning of promotion, deviations, failure to achieve the due effects, creating a bad impression among farmers, and even shaking their confidence in using power machines, affecting the speed of future development.

The following should be considered: the selection and quality assurance of gas engine models, the coordination of rural water sources, special attention to gasifier management technology, and the fuel supply methods for gasifiers. It is necessary to appropriately change some of the current habits of farmers, factories, and coal supply units to adapt to these characteristics and requirements.

Gas Engines Should Be Easy to Manage, Durable, and Reliable - Must Prevent Hasty Model Selection and Crude Manufacturing

In order to take into account the characteristics of using power machines in rural areas, the gas engines supplied to rural areas should be easy to manage, durable, and reliable. It is not advisable to choose too small models, generally no less than ten horsepower. Because if the machine is small, the gasifier is also small. Too small gasifiers tend to have unstable gas generation, and the adaptability to fuel is poor, making it difficult to maintain the normal use of the gas engine. The standard for durability and reliability of rural gas engines should be a lifespan of more than five years and a medium repair period of more than one year (approximately 1,500 hours of use). Therefore, high-speed models should not be used, and medium-speed models with a speed range of 1,000 to 1,500 revolutions per minute should be used. Too slow a speed and too heavy a machine are certainly not good, but too high a speed and too light a machine cannot be used durably in the field environment of farmland. Although medium-speed gas engines use more steel materials than lightweight high-speed engines (approximately 60 kilograms per horsepower), they have a longer lifespan, can be used durably, have lower consumption of engine oil and accessories, and are easier to manage, making it easier for farmers to master, which is more beneficial than harmful.

At present, many factories, in order to shorten the design and trial production time, use existing power engines from motor vehicles and modify them into gas engines, which is certainly a good emergency measure, but the speed must be reduced to one-half to two-thirds of the original maximum speed, and the ignition mechanism should be simplified to enable long-term use. If they are copied without modification or required to work at the maximum speed for a long time, they can only play a temporary role and cannot sustainably maintain economic benefits. As for rushing, hasty model selection, blind application, and crude manufacturing, it will only ruin things and must be strictly prevented.

Rural Areas Must Appropriately Expand Original Water Sources - Greed for Immediate Convenience Cannot Lead to Lasting Use

In order to take into account the characteristics of gas engine models and avoid selecting too small gas engines, the water source for irrigation using gas engines must adapt to the pumping volume of water pumps of ten horsepower or more. The original water source should be appropriately expanded, and deeper and larger wells should be dug so that the water output is three to four times larger than that of ordinary earthen wells to economically utilize human and machine power. If you are greedy for immediate convenience and simply add a very small gas engine to the old wells where people and animals draw water, although it can solve the current temporary needs, there will be many difficulties in management, and it cannot be used sustainably, which is extremely uneconomical.

After analyzing the number of gas engine orders in each province, the four provinces of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi in North China have the most, especially Henan and Hebei. The number of gas engine orders in the above four provinces accounts for 75% of the country, and Henan and Hebei alone account for 57% of the country. Looking at the average horsepower per unit ordered, Henan is 6.3 horsepower, Hebei is 9.1 horsepower, both below 10 horsepower, Shandong is 10.7 horsepower, and Shanxi is 14.2 horsepower. The average of other provinces in the country is 20 horsepower per unit. This shows that the four provinces in North China have the largest number of gas engines, but the horsepower per unit is the smallest. In the past, the experience of using gas engines in agriculture introduced in various newspapers and periodicals was mostly based on examples from the Jiangnan area, and in the use situation in the Jiangnan area, there are no such small models. This point deserves careful consideration. It is worthwhile for manufacturing departments and user units to organize several major debates to clarify the issue of model selection direction.

Special Attention Should Be Paid to Gasifier Management Technology - Emphasis Should Be Placed on Training in Assembly and Usage Methods

The key to the smooth use of gas engines lies not only in the engine itself, but more importantly in the equipment and management of the gasifier, and this is precisely what most people are relatively unfamiliar with. In the past, the general public believed that mastering and using gas engines was too difficult, and even some mysterious atmosphere existed, precisely because they did not pay enough attention to research on the use technology of gasifiers. Therefore, manufacturing plants should study the design and manufacture of gasifiers more, and technical training classes should also especially focus on training in the assembly and use technology of gasifiers.

Use Local Fuel to Supply Coal of Appropriate Particle Size
Crushed Coke from Steel Enterprises Can Be Considered for Supply to Rural Areas

The main advantage of using gas engines is that their fuel consumption is economical. To achieve this goal, a series of measures are also necessary. First of all, local fuels should be used as much as possible. Anthracite coal, coke, semi-coke, coal briquettes, charcoal, plant stalks, etc., can all be used. A variety of gasifiers should be designed to adapt to these fuels.

Anthracite coal is the fuel with the largest output and the lowest price. It can be used in most areas. Supply departments should reasonably divide supply areas, shorten transportation distances, and reduce transportation costs. New arrangements should also be made in terms of the anthracite coal supply method because the coal blocks suitable for gasifiers generally have a particle size of 7 to 15 mm (individual furnaces can also use 3 to 7 mm). Too large or too small will affect the performance of the gasifier. Coal supply departments should directly supply coal of appropriate particle size to rural users. If the traditional method is followed, and lump coal or mixed coal is transported to rural areas, farmers have to crush and screen it on the spot, which is not only labor-intensive but also wastes a lot of fines (approximately 30%). The most economical way to change this supply method is to screen at the mine and then ship them according to particle size separately. Suitable particle sizes can be supplied to rural gas engine users, large lumps can be supplied to urban residents, and coal fines can be supplied to industry or used by coal briquette factories to make coal briquettes, so that there is no waste.

Coking coal is the best fuel for gasifiers, and its price is relatively expensive, but steel enterprises have a large amount of crushed coke that is not suitable for smelting, which can be used by gasifiers. Under the principle of comprehensive utilization, coal transportation and sales departments should contact steel enterprises to screen this crushed coke and select appropriate particle sizes to supply to rural gas engine users, which kills two birds with one stone.

The above points are not too difficult to implement, but the main thing is to do it in a timely manner. There is not much time left before the irrigation season. It is necessary to take some emergency measures. The gas engines that have been arranged for production should be appraised in terms of model selection. For models that are too small and too light, production should be reduced or gradually phased out. In terms of quality, strict control should be exercised through certain procedures. In terms of rural water source preparation and the training of machine operators, extensive technical publicity and education work should be carried out, technical manuals and popular posters should be printed and distributed in large quantities, correct methods should be disseminated, and some inappropriate habits should be changed. The three aspects of fuel production, transportation, and sales must be linked together, breaking the conventional way and providing thorough service specifically for rural gas engine users.

Organize Technical Personnel to Go Down to the Countryside for Inspection, Help with Installation and Train Management Personnel

In addition, during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons of this year, a large number of technical workers and technical personnel must be organized to go down to the countryside to inspect and assist in the preparation, installation, training, use, and management of power irrigation, as much as possible to avoid the problems of having machines that cannot be used or are not used well, so that the machines can exert the greatest economic effect, and strive to achieve an average increase of 5,000 jin of grain per horsepower.

I am an engineering technician. I believe that gas engines are the most suitable power machines for agricultural mechanization in our country. At the second session of this congress in 1955, I, along with three other representatives, made a suggestion to promote power machines down to the countryside in large quantities. Now the government has implemented such measures on an unprecedented scale. I am very excited and concerned. At this congress, I heard the call for intellectuals to show their enthusiasm and go to the countryside to train in many representatives' speeches, and I also heard about the upsurge of farmers building water conservancy projects across the country, which made it impossible for my heart to calm down. I felt that I should also contribute to such an upsurge and train and transform myself. I would like to express here that I request to work directly for the peasant brothers in this matter of gas engines going down to the countryside during this time of "seeing three years in five years, and the first year in three years." I will go through the organization to request to go to the countryside to enable gas engines to be mastered and used in rural areas (especially in the North China region) and to obtain the due economic effects within one year, two years, or even three years, and to take root in the countryside. I guarantee to work in the field in rural areas all the time. I will go wherever I am needed and guarantee to do this work well. As for the specific methods mentioned above, please correct me if there is anything inappropriate.

    怎样使下乡的煤气机又好又省
    陆景云代表提出具体的建议
    今年全国农田水利建设，正在以高潮的形势大规模兴建，排水灌溉机械的需要，也大量增加。在今年国民经济计划中所列今年全国增加的农业排灌机械有五十万匹马力；据向水利部主管单位了解，全国农村提出的要求，达一百万匹马力以上，现在安排的生产数字，也已近七十万匹马力。又由于领导上提出了多发展煤气机的正确方针，今年煤气机的增加，在各种动力机中比例最大，将在三十八万至五十万匹马力之间，占全部动力机台数的百分之七十。这是煤气机的一个空前大发展，我们为这个发展所将带来的巨大经济效果而欢庆，也应该为保证这个经济效果而尽一切的努力。
    煤气机有若干特性和最低要求  筹划时就要注意到以免走弯路
    过去我国农民，尤其在华北一带，对动力机械的接触是很少的，今年这样大量的煤气机下乡，在许多农村里将是动力机械下乡的先锋。在各种动力机中，煤气机有最高的经济价值和最适合我国燃料资源情况的优点；但它的使用和管理有若干特性和最低要求，必须在筹划时就照顾到，以免在推广之始，走了弯路，发生偏差，得不到应有的效果，在农民中造成不好的印象，甚至动摇了他们使用动力机的信心，影响到以后的发展速度。
    这里应该考虑的为：煤气机机型的选择和质量的保证，农村水源的配合，煤气炉管理技术的特别重视，及煤气炉燃料的供应方式等问题。有必要为了照顾这些特点和要求而在农民、工厂及煤炭供应单位等方面，适当的改变一些现在的习惯作法，来适应它。
    煤气机要管理容易耐久可靠  必须防止仓促选型粗制滥造
    为了照顾到在农村使用动力机的特点，供给农村的煤气机，该是管理容易，耐久可靠的。不宜选用太小的机型，一般应不小于十匹马力。因为机器小了煤气炉也小，太小的煤气炉发生煤气不易稳定，燃料的适应性也差，难于经常保持煤气机的正常使用。农村用煤气机耐久可靠的标准，应是寿命在五年以上，中修期在一年以上（约一千五百使用小时）；这样就不能用高速的机型，而宜用每分钟转速在一千至一千五百转范围内的中速机型。转速太慢、机器太重，固然不好，但转速过高、机器过轻，就不能在农田的野外环境下耐久使用。中速的煤气机虽比轻型高速的用钢铁材料较多（约每马力六十公斤），但寿命长，能耐久使用，机油及配件的消耗低，管理较便，农民较易掌握，是利多弊少的。
    目前许多工厂，为了缩短设计、试制时间，选用现成的机动车辆的动力机改为煤气机，固然是很好的应急措施，但也必须把转速降低到原来最高转速的一半至三分之二，简化点火机构，使能长期使用。若原封不动的抄制，或要求它在最高转速下长期工作，就只能起暂时的作用，不能持久维持经济效果。至于急不及待，仓促选型，生搬硬套，粗制滥造，那只有把事情搞坏，必须严格防止的。
    农村必须适当扩大原有水源  贪图眼前方便不能持久使用
    为了照顾到煤气机型的特点，避免选用太小的煤气机，使用煤气机灌溉的水源，必须要适应十匹马力以上水泵的抽水量，适当的把原有的水源扩大，打较深较大的井，使出水量比一般的土井大三、四倍，才能经济的利用人力机力。若贪图眼前方便，只简单的在人、畜力取水的旧井上加一套很小的煤气机，虽能解决目前一时的需要，但管理上会有许多困难，不能持久使用，是极不经济的。
    经分析各省煤气机订货的台数，以华北的河南、河北、山东、山西四省为多，而尤以河南、河北两省为最多；以上四省煤气机的订货台数占全国的百分之七十五，仅河南、河北两省即占全国的百分之五十七。再从订货的每台平均马力来看，河南为六点三匹，河北为九点一匹，都在十匹马力以下，山东为十点七匹，山西为十四点二匹；全国其他各省的平均为每台二十匹马力。从这里说明华北四省的煤气机台数最多而每台马力最小，以往各种报刊上介绍农业使用煤气机的经验，以江南地区的例子为较多，而在江南地区的使用情况，则没有这样小的机型；这一点就值得慎重考虑。制造部门与使用单位中值得组织几次大辩论，来明确这个选型方向的问题。
    应特别重视煤气炉管理技术  要着重训练装配和使用方法
    煤气机的顺利使用，其关键不只在发动机方面，更主要的是在煤气炉的配备和管理方面，而这方面又正是一般人所比较生疏的。以往，一般人对于煤气机的掌握运用，认为困难太多，甚至存在一些神秘气氛，也正是由于对煤气炉的使用技术不太重视研究。为此，制造厂应当较多的研究煤气炉的设计和制造，技术训练班也应当特别着重煤气炉装配和使用技术的训练。
    利用当地燃料供应适当粒度煤炭
    钢铁企业的碎焦可考虑供应农村
    使用煤气机的主要优点，在于它的燃料消耗经济，要达到这一目的，也须有一系列的措施。首先是尽量利用当地燃料，凡无烟煤、焦炭、半焦炭、煤球、木炭、植物茎杆等，都可利用，应设计多种多样的煤气炉，来适应这些燃料。
    无烟煤是产量最大价格较低的燃料，在大部分地区都可用它，供应部门应合理的划分供应区域，缩短运输距离，降低运输成本。在无烟煤供应方式方面，也要做一些新的安排；因为对煤气炉适用的煤块，一般粒度应在七至十五公厘（个别的炉子也可用三至七公厘），过大过小都会影响煤气炉的性能。煤炭供应部门应当做到对农村用户直接供应适当粒度的煤炭；若按习惯办法，把块煤或混煤运去农村，农民不得不就地拷碎筛用，不但费工，还会浪费很多碎屑（约百分之三十）。改变这种供应方式的最经济方法，是在矿上分筛，然后分别粒度发运；适合的粒度可供应农村煤气机用户，大块的可供应城市居民，煤屑可供应工业或由煤球厂制作煤球，这样就都没有浪费了。
    焦煤是煤气炉的最好燃料，它的价格比较贵，但是在钢铁企业内有大量不适合冶炼用的碎焦，正是煤气炉所可以利用的。应该在综合利用的原则下，煤炭运销部门与钢铁企业取得联系，把这种碎焦分筛，选取适当粒度的供应农村煤气机用户，这就一举两得。
    以上几点在执行上是不多困难的，主要是要做得及时。现在离灌溉季节时间已不多，有必要就采取一些紧急措施。对于已安排生产的煤气机，在机型上进行鉴定，对于太小的和太轻型的机种，减少生产或逐渐淘汰；在质量上，经过一定的手续，严格控制。在农村的水源准备方面，及机手的训练方面，要展开广泛的技术宣传教育工作，大量印发技术手册和通俗挂图，传布正确方法，改变一些不适宜的习惯作法。燃料的产、运、销三方面，则须联系起来，打破常规，专为农村煤气机用户作周到的服务。
    组织技术人员下乡检查  帮助安装和训练管理人员
    此外，还须在今年春夏秋三季，组织大量技术工人及技术人员，下乡检查、帮助关于动力灌溉的准备、安装、训练、使用管理等工作，尽可能避免有了机器用不上、或用不好的毛病，使机器发挥最大的经济效果，争取都能达到每马力平均增产五千斤粮食的成绩。
    我是一个工程技术人员，相信煤气机是最适合我国农村机械化的动力机器，在一九五五年的本届第二次代表大会上，与其他三位代表一同提过大量推广动力机器下乡的建议；现在政府已以空前的规模实行这样的措施，我是非常兴奋和关心的。在这次大会上在许多代表的发言中，听到了知识分子应该拿出干劲、下乡锻炼的号召，又听到了全国各地农民群众兴修水利的高潮情况，更不能使自己的心平静下来；感觉到我也应该在这样的高潮中出一分力，并锻炼自己改造自己。我在这里表示，要求在这“五年看三年，三年看头年”的时候，在煤气机下乡这件事上，直接为农民弟兄工作。我将通过组织，要求下到农村去，以一年二年以至三年的时间，使煤气机在农村里（尤其在华北地区）能被掌握使用，能获得应有的经济效果，并在农村里扎下根子。我保证以全部时间在各地农村的现场中工作，那里需要就去那里，保证把这件工作做好。至于上面所提的具体办法，如有不妥之处，请大家指正。
