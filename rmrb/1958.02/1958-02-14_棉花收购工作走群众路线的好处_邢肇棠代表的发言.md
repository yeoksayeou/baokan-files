The Benefits of Following the Mass Line in Cotton Procurement Work
Speech by Representative Xing Zhaotang

I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the mass line in cotton procurement work.

Implementing "Four Separations" and Democratic Grading Benefits Both the State and Agricultural Cooperatives

As of early January this year, Henan Province had completed the procurement of 2.85 million dan of cotton for 1957, exceeding the state's target of 2.5 million dan by 10.4%, and exceeding the 1.76 million dan of the same period last year by 62%. The reason why this year's cotton procurement task could be completed so quickly and exceeded the target with significantly improved quality is mainly because, during the nationwide rectification movement, specialized discussions, debates, and big character posters were conducted on the issue of patriotic cotton sales, greatly enhancing the socialist awareness of the broad masses of grassroots cadres and cotton farmers, overcoming the one-sided mass viewpoint of some cadres and the individualistic thinking of some cotton farmers. At the same time, on the basis of raising socialist awareness, the mass line work method was relatively widely implemented in the procurement work. Before cotton picking, the province trained 40,000 to 50,000 grading technicians for agricultural cooperatives, and through them, promoted to cotton farmers the benefits of grading cotton according to the national standards, teaching cotton farmers the techniques of picking cotton separately according to the quality. During cotton picking, a "four separations" movement of separating picking, separating drying, separating storing, and separating selling was launched among the masses. When purchasing cotton, the cotton purchasing station, together with representatives of the agricultural cooperative and grading technicians, would democratically consult to assess the grade, length, ginning outturn, moisture content, and impurities of the cotton, which is called "four assessments". As a result, the quality of cotton has been generally improved, the income of agricultural cooperatives has increased, the mass viewpoint and production viewpoint of the purchasing personnel have been strengthened, and the relationship between the state and the cotton farmers has been further strengthened. The achievements are great.

The situation in many areas shows that by implementing "four separations," separating good cotton from inferior cotton, removing impurities, and reducing moisture, the quality of cotton can be generally improved. In this way, although the grade of a small portion of low-quality cotton will be reduced, the grade of most good-quality cotton will increase. For example, in 1956, Yanshi County did not implement "four separations," and the average grade of cotton in the county was only grade five. In 1957, after implementing "four separations," the average grade of cotton in the county was raised to grade three, meaning that the quality of cotton improved by two grades. The impurities contained in the cotton purchased throughout the province from September to December 1957 decreased by 27% compared with the same period last year, and the moisture content of the cotton also generally decreased. Of course, the rapid improvement in quality is inseparable from the suitable climate last year, the promotion of improved varieties, and other aspects of production, but it is also closely related to the implementation of "four separations" in cotton picking.

Increased Cotton Quality Increases Farmers' Income; Textile Industry Saves Labor Costs

Due to the implementation of the "four separations" method, the quality of cotton has been improved, which has primarily increased the income of agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, the "four separations" method is warmly welcomed by the broad masses of cotton farmers, which further enhances their enthusiasm for producing and selling cotton. At the beginning of the promotion of the "four separations" experience, many agricultural cooperatives and farmers had resistance. They misunderstood the implementation of "four separations" as simply increasing trouble, fearing that they would not be able to sell at a good price, resulting in a waste of labor and money, or that the increase in income would be too small to offset the costs. After practical experiments and comparisons, these concerns were quickly eliminated. One production team of the Xujiagou Agricultural Cooperative in Anyang County did not implement "four separations" for the first 1,700 jin of cotton picked, and good and inferior cotton were mixed together, and the impurities were not completely removed. The average selling price per dan of cotton was 32.27 yuan. Later, they used the "four separations" method to pick 5,585 jin of cotton, and the average selling price per dan increased to 33.72 yuan. Implementing "four separations" resulted in an increase of 1.45 yuan per dan of cotton compared to not implementing "four separations." This production team had more than 37,000 jin of cotton with "four separations," which could increase income by several hundred yuan. This is an example of a relatively small increase in income. There are many other examples where implementing "four separations" resulted in an increase of two, three, or even five or six yuan per dan of cotton. This greatly encouraged the cotton farmers, who regarded the "four separations" work as something that was closely related to their own interests. They said: "If it weren't for the implementation of 'four separations,' we wouldn't be able to sell at such a high price. In the future, we must listen to the government and welcome the guidance of the purchasing station comrades on our technology."

The implementation of the "four separations" method is also beneficial to the state. After separating good cotton from inferior cotton, the proportion of good cotton increases, and the grades of cotton are standardized, the textile industry can implement superior cotton for superior use. After the impurities in the cotton are removed, the textile industry can save cotton spinning labor costs and reduce cotton loss during cleaning. Therefore, the implementation of the "four separations" method of cotton is beneficial to both the state and the agricultural cooperatives.

Democratic Grading Enlightens Farmers; Reduces Disputes and Facilitates Cotton Procurement

Implementing the mass line work method in cotton procurement work also has great political significance. The cotton procurement department consults with farmers in advance and publicizes the national grading standards, helps agricultural cooperatives train grading technicians, imparts cotton grading techniques to farmers, and jointly democratically consults with farmers to assess cotton grades. This enables the commercial work to be closely integrated with agricultural production, thereby strengthening the production viewpoint and mass viewpoint of the procurement personnel, and further strengthening the relationship between the state and the farmers. In recent years, the procurement department has been able to adhere to the principle of serving the people in cotton procurement work and ensure the production interests of cotton farmers, and the work has been basically successful. However, in the past cotton grading and evaluation work, disputes often occurred between procurement personnel and farmers. Studying its reasons, it is true that a small number of cotton procurement personnel had biases of being too strict or too lenient, or sometimes strict and sometimes lenient, in the grading and evaluation work, causing some farmers to feel that the inspection work done by the procurement personnel was not accurate enough and not fair enough. Therefore, they are prone to have opinions. However, the more and more important reason why disputes occur between procurement personnel and farmers is that we did not hand over the technology to the farmers in the past, and did not implement the "four separations" and democratic grading methods. In the past, farmers mixed good and inferior cotton together, which did not meet the national grading standards based on the quality of the cotton. Therefore, it was often difficult to assess whether the cotton was good enough for the higher grade or whether there was too much good cotton for the lower grade, which brought great difficulties to the cotton grading and evaluation work. In addition, the purchasing station did not consult with farmers in advance on the national grading standards, nor did it absorb farmer representatives to jointly conduct consultations, and everyone lacked common standards and common language. Therefore, some cotton farmers felt that the inspection personnel were downgrading and underpricing the cotton, feeling that they had suffered a great loss; the inspection personnel were also distressed because the grades were difficult to assess accurately. The main dispute between the two sides arose from this point.

After the implementation of the "four separations" and democratic grading methods, the situation has fundamentally changed. The grading and pricing issues that procurement personnel and cotton farmers often dispute over have been basically resolved. Now, "four separations" and democratic grading have become a common matter for the procurement department and the agricultural cooperative, and the national standards have become the common basis for democratic consultation. In this way, they trust each other more and become more intimate, and the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual supervision has been further promoted. For example, cotton farmers said: "Selling cotton in the past was like crossing the Black Sea, but now selling cotton is really clear and bright." The meaning is that in the past, it was difficult to know whether they were at a disadvantage or an advantage, and it was difficult to distinguish whether it was fair and reasonable or whether the cotton was being downgraded and underpriced, which easily caused opinions. Now that they have mastered the technology and participate in democratic evaluation, they feel that it is both fair and reasonable. The Cantian Cotton Purchasing Station in Yanshi County, due to following the mass line in procurement work, did not have any disputes with cotton farmers on grading and evaluation during the 120 days of the peak cotton season from September to December. At the same time, under the supervision and promotion of the masses, the procurement personnel strengthened their sense of responsibility, improved their work style, and improved their inspection technology. There are also many examples of agricultural cooperatives using the quality of "four separations" as one of the standards for internal production competition and using the results of democratic grading as the basis for checking the performance of each production team. In short, wherever this mass line work method is implemented, the cotton farmers' production enthusiasm will be higher, and the cotton procurement work will inevitably proceed smoothly.

The Technology is Not Complicated and Easy to Do; Can Be Learned After Ten Days of Training

The technology of implementing "four separations" and democratic grading is not very complicated and is relatively easy to do. It only requires cotton farmers to separate and pick insect-damaged cotton and unopen boll cotton from good cotton when picking cotton, and to pick the first, second, and tail-end cotton in batches and according to quality. Then, dry the cotton separately according to the picking classification, and at the same time, pick out mixed-in inferior cotton and impurities. After drying, store the cotton separately according to classification. Finally, pack the cotton separately according to classification and sell it to the purchasing station. After arriving at the purchasing station, democratically consult to assess the grade according to the national standards. The technology of these "four separations" and inspections can generally be learned after about ten days of training. This shows that solving the technical problems is not very difficult. The key lies in whether the masses can be fully mobilized and whether the "four separations" and inspection techniques can be mastered by the broad masses of cotton farmers. In this regard, we have three points of experience:

Several Points of Experience

First, we must trust and rely on the masses. In the past, many procurement workers often regarded grading and inspection technology as their own private power and did not hand it over to the masses, so it was easy to become detached from the masses. As a result, the masses had opinions and their work was not done well. In the process of implementing "four separations" and democratic grading, there are still many procurement workers who have resistance. They are afraid that the masses will use their mastery of technology to deliberately make things difficult for them, which is essentially unwilling to accept the supervision of the masses and not prepared to continue to improve their business and technology. These ideas are manifestations of distrust of the masses and are therefore extremely wrong and harmful. Facts have proved that after the masses have learned grading and inspection technology, the quality of cotton has improved, the inspection is more accurate, the disputes have been greatly reduced, and the work has become easier.

Second, as long as the cotton grading and inspection technology is mastered by the broad masses, it will generate huge material power and overcome all difficulties in the work. Many facts show that when the masses truly realize that "four separations" and democratic grading are indeed beneficial to them, they will consciously and actively take action. At the beginning of the implementation of "four separations" and democratic grading, some agricultural cooperatives were unwilling to send people to training classes to learn technology, and even if they sent people, they had to calculate labor points back to the public. After they received real benefits, they would compete to send more people to participate in the training classes. Once the masses consciously act, they will try their best to overcome the difficulties in the work, thereby enriching the experience of "four separations" and democratic grading.

Third, earnestly cultivate the technical backbone of agricultural cooperatives. On the basis of doing a good job in political and ideological work, cultivating a sufficient team of technical backbone is a key to carrying out the "four separations" movement and a prerequisite for implementing democratic grading. Experience has proved that only by combining leaders with the masses through the backbone can the movement develop persistently and deeply, can the experience and wisdom of the masses be concentrated at any time, and can the smooth progress of cotton procurement work be guaranteed.

The above shows that in future cotton procurement work, we must resolutely adopt the mass line work method. Here we have gained another valuable insight. Since cotton procurement work can follow the mass line, then many other agricultural product procurement work are also completely possible and completely should adopt the mass line work method, because the mass line is the fundamental line of all our work.

Please correct the above opinions.

    棉花收购工作走群众路线的好处
    邢肇棠代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任所作的各项报告。现在就棉花收购工作中的群众路线问题发表一点意见。
    实行“四分”和民主评级对国家对农业社都有利
    河南省一九五七年度棉花收购任务，截至今年元月上旬统计，已经完成二百八十五万担，超过国家任务二百五十万担的百分之十点四，超过去年同期一百七十六万担的百分之六十二。今年棉花收购任务之所以能够迅速地超额完成，并且质量大大提高，主要是由于在全民性整风运动中，对于爱国售棉问题进行了专门大鸣、大放、大辩论，大大提高了广大基层干部和棉农的社会主义觉悟，克服了一部分干部的片面群众观点和一部分棉农的个人主义思想；同时在提高社会主义觉悟的基础上，在进行收购工作中，又比较普遍地实行了群众路线的工作方法。在棉花采摘以前，全省为农业社训练了四、五万名分级技术人员，并且通过他们向棉农群众宣传了按照国家规定的等级标准进行棉花分级的好处，教会棉农根据棉花质量的好次分别进行采摘的技术；在采摘棉花的时候，发动群众开展了棉花分摘、分晒、分存、分售的“四分”运动。在收购棉花的时候，由棉花采购站会同农业社的代表和分级技术人员，根据国家规定的等级标准，民主协商评定棉花的品级、长度、衣分率、水分杂质，即所谓进行“四评”。这样作的结果，普遍提高了棉花的质量，增加了农业社的收入，加强了采购人员的群众观点和生产观点，进一步密切了国家同棉农的关系。成绩是很大的。
    许多地区的情况说明，实行“四分”，把好棉同次棉分清，把杂质拣净，把水分降低，棉花的质量就可以普遍提高。这样作，虽然一小部分低次棉花的等级要降低，但是大部分好棉花的等级都是上升的。例如，偃师县一九五六年没有实行“四分”，全县的棉花品级平均只达五级，一九五七年实行了“四分”，全县的平均品级就提高为三级，就是说棉花质量提高了两个品级。全省一九五七年九至十二月收购的棉花中间所含的杂质，比上年同期减少了百分之二十七，棉花所含水分也普遍有所降低。当然，质量提高得这样快，同去年气候适宜、推广优良品种和生产工作中的其他一些情况是分不开的，但是它与实行棉花采摘的“四分”也有很大关系。
    棉花质量提高农民收入增加  纺织工业部门节省工序费用
    由于实行了“四分”的方法，提高了棉花质量，首先使农业社的收入增加了。所以“四分”的方法受到广大棉农的热烈欢迎，更加提高了他们生产和出售棉花的积极性。在推广“四分”经验之初，不少农业社和农民有抵触的情绪。他们把实行“四分”误解是徒然增加麻烦，深怕实行“四分”卖不到好价钱反而劳民伤财，或者收入增加很少而得不偿失。经过实际的试验和对比，这些顾虑就很快地消除了。安阳县许家沟农业社的一个生产队，开始摘的一千七百斤棉花没有实行“四分”，好次棉花混杂在一起，杂质也没有清除干净，每担棉花平均卖价是三十二元二角七分；后来他们用“四分”方法采摘了五千五百八十五斤棉花，平均每担卖价提高到三十三元七角二分。实行“四分”比不实行“四分”每担棉花要多卖一元四角五分。这个生产队实行“四分”的棉花共有三万七千多斤，可以增加收入五百几十元。这是一个收入增加较少的例子，其它实行“四分”比不实行“四分”，每担棉花增加二、三元以至五、六元的事例是很多的。这就大大鼓舞了棉农的情绪，他们把“四分”工作看成是同自己有切身利害的事情。他们说：“要不是实行‘四分’，就卖不到这样大的价钱，今后一定要听政府的话，欢迎采购站同志指导我们的技术”。
    实行“四分”的方法，对于国家也有好处。好棉同次棉分清以后，好的棉比重增加了，棉花的品级整齐了，纺织工业部门就可以实行优棉优用。把棉花杂质清除以后，纺织工业部门就可以节省棉纺的工序费用，减少清理棉花过程中的落棉损失。因此，实行棉花“四分”方法，对国家和对农业社都有好处。
    实行民主评级农民心明眼亮  争执减少收购棉花进行顺利
    在棉花收购工作中实行群众路线的工作方法，还有它很大的政治意义。棉花采购部门把国家规定的等级标准，事前同农民商量和向农民公布，帮助农业社训练分级技术人员，把棉花分级技术传授给农民，并且同农民一起民主协商评定棉花的等级，这就能够把商业工作同农业生产紧密地结合起来，从而加强了采购工作人员的生产观点和群众观点，进一步密切了国家同农民的关系。几年来采购部门在棉花收购工作中，能够遵守为人民服务的原则，保证了棉农的生产利益，工作基本上是有成绩的。但是在过去的棉花验级评价工作上，采购人员同农民之间也时常发生一些争执。研究它的原因，确有少数棉花采购人员在验级评价工作上存在着过严过宽或者是时严时宽的偏向，致使某些农民感到采购人员检验工作做得不够准确和不够公平。因而他们就容易发生意见。不过，采购人员同农民之间所以发生争执，更多更重要的原因，还是过去我们没有把技术交给农民，没有实行“四分”和民主评级的方法。过去的情况是，农民把好棉同次棉混杂在一起，它不符合国家按照棉花好次而规定的等级标准，所以就往往有许多棉花评它是上一个等级很嫌不够，算它是下一个等级其中又有不少的好棉花，因而就给棉花验级评价工作带来了很大困难。加上采购站又没有把国家规定的等级标准事前同农民商量，也没有吸收农民代表共同进行协商，大家缺乏共同的标准和共同的语言。因此，有些棉农认为检验人员压级压价，感到自己吃了大亏；检验人员也由于等级难以评得准确而苦闷，双方的争论主要就从这里发生。
    实行“四分”和民主评级的方法以后，情况就根本改变了，几年来采购人员同棉农之间经常发生争执的评级议价问题，基本上得到了解决。现在“四分”和民主评级，已经成为采购部门同农业社共同的事情，国家规定的标准，已经成为民主协商的共同根据，这样相互之间就更加信任和更加亲密了，相互帮助和相互监督的精神也得到进一步发扬，比如，棉农说：“过去卖棉花好像过黑海，现在卖棉花真是心明眼亮。”意思是说，过去摸不准是吃亏还是占了便宜，辨不清是公平合理还是压级压价，容易产生意见；现在自己掌握了技术，而且参加民主评议，就觉得既公平又合理。偃师县参店棉花采购站，由于在收购工作中走了群众路线，在九至十二月棉花上市旺季的一百二十天之内，在验级评价上没有同棉农发生什么争执。同时采购人员在群众的监督和推动下，加强了工作责任心，改进了工作作风，提高了检验技术；以及农业社把“四分”的好坏做为社内评比生产的标准之一，把民主评级的结果做为检查各生产队成绩的依据等等的例子是很多的。总之，哪里实行了这种群众路线的工作方法，哪里的棉农生产情绪就显得更加高涨，棉花收购工作也必然进行得顺利。
    技术不复杂做起来容易  经过十天训练就可学会
    实行“四分”和民主评级，技术并不很复杂，作起来也比较容易，它只要求棉农在采摘棉的花时候，把虫害棉、僵瓣棉同好棉分开采摘，把头喷、二喷和尾稍棉花分批、分好次采摘；然后按照采摘的分类进行分晒，同时挑拣混入的次棉和杂质；分晒以后，分类进行储存；最后是按照分类分别包装向采购站出售。到了采购站以后，根据国家规定的等级标准民主协商评定等级。这些“四分”和检验的技术，一般经过十天左右的训练就可以学会。这就说明解决技术上的问题并不是很困难的。关键在于是不是能够充分发动群众，是不是能把“四分”和检验的技术为广大棉农群众所掌握。在这方面，归纳起来我们有三点体会：
    几点体会
    第一，必须相信群众和依靠群众。过去，许多采购工作人员，往往把分级检验技术当作自己的私有权力，不把它交给群众掌握，所以容易脱离群众，结果是群众有意见，自己的工作没有做好。在实行“四分”和民主评级的过程中，仍然有不少采购工作人员存在着抵触情绪，他们怕群众掌握技术来故意跟自己为难，这实质上是不愿意接受群众的监督，不准备继续提高自己的业务和技术。这些思想都是不信任群众的表现，因而是极端错误和有害的。事实证明，群众学会了分级检验技术以后，棉花质量提高了，验级更加准确了，争执大大减少了，工作也就好做了。
    第二，只要棉花分级检验技术为广大群众所掌握，就能产生巨大的物质力量，克服工作中的一切困难。许多事实说明，当群众真正认识到“四分”和民主评级对自己确实有利，就会自觉地积极地行动起来。在开始推行“四分”和民主评级的时候，有的农业社不愿派人到训练班学习技术，甚至派出人去还要向公家算回劳动工分。等到他们得到了实惠以后，再办训练班就争着要求多派人参加学习。当群众一经自觉地行动起来，他们就想尽办法来克服工作中的困难，从而丰富了“四分”和民主评级的经验。
    第三，认真培养农业社的技术骨干。在作好政治思想工作的基础上，培养足够的技术骨干队伍，是开展“四分”运动的一个关键，是实行民主评级的前提。经验证明，只有领导通过骨干同群众结合起来，才能使运动持久和深入地发展，才能把群众的经验和智慧随时集中起来，才能保证棉花收购工作顺利地进行。
    以上说明，在今后的棉花收购工作中，我们必须坚决采取群众路线的工作方法。在这里我们又得到了一个宝贵的启示，既然棉花收购工作可以走群众路线，那么，其它许多农产品收购工作，也都完全可能和完全应该采取群众路线的工作方法，因为群众路线是我们各项工作的根本路线。
    以上意见请各位代表指正。
