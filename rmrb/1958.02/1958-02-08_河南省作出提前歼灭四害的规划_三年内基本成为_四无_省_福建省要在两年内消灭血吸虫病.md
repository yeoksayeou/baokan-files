Henan Province Makes Plan to Eliminate the Four Pests Ahead of Schedule
　　Basically Become a "Four-Without" Province in Three Years
　　Fujian Province to Eliminate Schistosomiasis in Two Years
　　(This newspaper's report) Henan Daily News: The Henan Provincial Patriotic Health Campaign Committee held a meeting on February 3 to revise the province's plan for eliminating the four pests, and decided to basically become a "four-without" province within three years ahead of schedule.
　　The meeting analyzed the current development of the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests: It was believed that this campaign was launched under the favorable situation of a comprehensive Great Leap Forward. The development of the campaign has continuously prompted leaders to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and establish advanced thinking. The meeting believed that the province's plan for eliminating the four pests formulated in the previous stage had lagged behind the demands of the masses; at the same time, the elimination of the four pests must be done in one go to the end, and a little slackening or delay will cause the four pests to grow again. Therefore, it is necessary and possible to quickly eliminate the four pests and complete the task ahead of schedule. The meeting decided that the province should strive to basically achieve "four-without" in three years. Cities directly under the province should achieve "four-without" or "five-without" in 1958, each special zone should have three, four, or five counties achieve "four-without" or "five-without", and more districts, townships, cooperatives, households, factories, mines, organs, groups, and enterprises should achieve "four-without" or "five-without", and it is required to combine the elimination of the four pests with promoting production, improving hygiene habits, and preventing diseases, so as to truly achieve the goal of changing customs and habits.
　　(This newspaper's report) Fujian Daily News: The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have decided to sweep away in one year and eliminate schistosomiasis in two years throughout the province. A large-scale mass movement to prevent and control schistosomiasis will be fully launched in ten coastal counties.
　　On January 31, a provincial work conference on the prevention and control of schistosomiasis was held in Fuzhou. Participating in the meeting were the county party secretaries of the ten epidemic areas, more than 30 district party secretaries, the heads of the provincial schistosomiasis prevention and control institutes and stations, as well as experts and professors from medical and epidemic prevention units and scientific research institutions, and representatives of the garrison troops. Wei Jinshui, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor, called on the people of the ten coastal counties at the meeting to muster revolutionary spirit, conscientiously implement the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, and completely eliminate schistosomiasis within two years. He said that in recent years, Fujian Province has made certain achievements in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis, treating more than 8,700 patients and eliminating snails in an area of more than 1.35 million square meters, but it is still far from the targets set by the central and provincial governments. Therefore, we must speed up our efforts and eliminate schistosomiasis within two years.

　　河南省作出提前歼灭四害的规划
    三年内基本成为“四无”省
    福建省要在两年内消灭血吸虫病
    本报讯　河南日报消息：河南省爱国卫生运动委员会2月3日召开会议，修订了全省除四害规划，决定提前在三年内基本成为“四无”省。
    会议对当前以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动发展情况作了分析：认为这次运动是在出现了全面大跃进的有利形势下开展起来的。运动的开展不断促使领导上克服右倾保守思想，树立先进思想。会议认为前一阶段所订的全省除四害规划，已经落后于群众的要求；同时，除四害必须一股劲干到底，稍一松弛、延迟，四害又会生长。因此有必要也有可能迅速歼灭四害，提前完成任务。会议决定全省争取在三年内基本上实现“四无”。省属各市在1958年实现“四无”或“五无”，每一专区有三、四、五个县实现“四无”或“五无”，有更多的区、乡、社、户和厂矿、机关、团体、企业单位实现“四无”、“五无”，并且要求把除四害与促进生产、改进卫生习惯、防止疾病结合起来，真正达到移风易俗的目的。
    本报讯　福建日报消息：中共福建省委、省人民委员会决定全省一年扫荡、二年消灭血吸虫病。一个大规模的群众性防治血吸虫病运动即将在沿海十县全面展开。
    1月31日，在福州举行了全省防治血吸虫病工作会议。参加这次会议的有十个疫区的县委书记、三十多个区委书记、全省血吸虫病防治所、站的负责人，以及医疗防疫单位、科学研究机构的专家、教授及驻军代表。中共福建省委书记、副省长魏金水在会上号召沿海十县人民鼓起革命干劲，认真贯彻省委指示，在两年内彻底消灭血吸虫病。他说，几年来福建省在防治血吸虫病工作中取得了一定的成绩，治疗病人八千七百多人，灭螺面积达一百三十五万多平方公尺，但是离中央及省的指标还差得很远。因此必须快马加鞭，一定要在两年内把血吸虫病消灭掉。
