Xinhua News Agency, February 10th -- Several stores and public places in Beijing that are closely related to the people's lives are taking active measures to improve their work and eliminate the phenomenon of queuing for purchases and transportation.

The Beifengwo non-staple food store, which used to have hundreds or even nearly a thousand customers waiting in line every morning, has basically eliminated queuing in the past month or two. Their methods are: First, adjust working hours in accordance with the spirit of serving customers; second, adjust the organization of labor to achieve a balance between busy and slack times. Clerks selling general merchandise and fruit also participate in selling meat, vegetables, and cooking oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar in the morning. There were only two clerks selling meat before, but now there are more than a dozen people selling meat at the same time during busy periods; third, prepare for selling goods during slack times. For example, meat is pre-cut and packaged according to the quantity customers often buy, so that customers can pay and take the goods immediately; fourth, the number of mobile sales vehicles has increased from four to eight, delivering goods to customers' doors on time. This socialist business style has been highly praised by customers.

The ticket offices of the forty-three city-owned theaters and cinemas in the urban area no longer have queuing phenomena today. After seeing the initiative of the workers of the Tianqiao Department Store and the Mishi Street Non-Staple Food Store on promoting a great leap forward in commercial work, the employees of these theaters and cinemas generally conducted discussions that evening and decided to immediately break with conventions and take measures such as adding ticket windows, setting up more ticket sales points, extending ticket sales hours, and selling tickets in advance to eliminate the phenomenon of audiences queuing to buy tickets. During the discussion, the employees of the Zhonghe Theater also proposed that everyone should learn to "work comprehensively," and managers and accountants can all sell tickets. They also stipulated that ticket sales hours should be from morning to 11:00 p.m., so that audiences can buy tickets as soon as they arrive. At the same time, the method of telephone booking and ticket delivery will be restored.

Beijing's railway stations and ticket sales units have adopted the method of adding ticket windows to eliminate the phenomenon of queuing. The staff of the Beijing Railway Station ticket office and the station have organized shock teams to help sell tickets in shifts during their rest time. Cadres from the Beijing Railway Administration have also organized a shock team to help sell tickets, ready to move out immediately when the ticket sales situation is tight. Some ticket sales units, due to too many passenger inquiries affecting the speed of ticket sales, have added temporary service points to answer passenger inquiries. Some ticket sales units of the Beijing Long-Distance Transportation Company will double the ticket sales hours from the 11th. The Beijing Public Transport Company will, through relevant departments, plan to collect large vehicles scattered in various units to participate in transportation when there are more passengers. During the Spring Festival, from the 16th to the 20th, it will first increase by seventy to more than one hundred buses, and will also open night buses on five lines leading to the eastern, western, and southern suburbs. The Beijing Tram Company is also preparing to establish a general traffic command and command stations during the Spring Festival to dispatch or increase vehicles at any time to facilitate passengers.

Now, following these advanced units, more units that are closely related to the daily lives of the people are actively studying ways to eliminate mass queuing.

    北京市若干商店和公共场所采取措施
    大力消除顾客排队现象
    新华社10日讯　北京市与人民生活有密切关系的副食品商店、影剧院、火车站和电车、公共汽车公司等单位，已经或正在积极采取措施改进工作，消灭排队候购、候乘的现象。
    过去每天早晨常有几百甚至近千个候购顾客的北蜂窝副食品商店，在近一两个月内已经基本上消灭了排队的现象。他们的办法是：一、按照便利顾客的精神，调整工作时间；二、调整劳动组织，做到忙闲互济。卖百货、水果的店员在早晨也参加卖肉、卖菜、卖油盐酱醋的工作，原来只有两个店员卖肉，现在忙时就有十几个人同时卖肉；三、闲时做好卖货的准备工作，如肉类就按顾客常买的数量在事前切好包好，使顾客随付钱随取货；四、流动售货车由四辆增为八辆，按时把货物送到顾客的门上。他们这种社会主义的经营作风，受到了顾客的极大赞扬。
    市属的城区四十三个影剧院的售票处，今天已经没有排队候购的现象。这些影剧院的职工，看到了天桥百货商场、米市大街副食品商店职工们的关于促进商业工作大跃进的倡议以后，当天晚上就普遍地进行了讨论，决定立即打破陈规采取增添售票窗口、多设售票点、延长售票时间、预先售票等措施，来消灭观众买票排队的现象。中和剧院职工在讨论中还提出，每个人要学会“全面工作”，经理、会计都可以去售票，并且规定从早晨到晚间十一时为售票时间，观众随到随买，同时恢复电话订票和送票的办法。
    北京各火车站及其售票单位，已经采取了增设售票窗口的办法来消灭排队的现象。北京车站售票所和车站的职工组织了突击队，轮班在休息时间流动帮助售票。北京铁路管理局的干部也组织了帮助售票的突击队，准备在售票情况紧张时立即出动。有的售票单位因旅客问话太多影响售票速度，已增加临时服务处来解答旅客的问讯。北京市长途运输公司有的售票单位，从11日起把售票时间较前延长一倍。北京市公共汽车公司将通过有关部门，有计划地征集分散在各单位的大型汽车，以便在乘客较多时参加运送工作。在春节期间，从16日到20日，将首先增加七十辆到一百多辆汽车，并且在通往东郊、西郊、南郊等郊区的五条线路上增开夜班公共汽车。北京市电车公司也准备在春节期间，建立行车总指挥部和指挥站，随时调度或增加车辆，以便利乘客。
    现在，继这些先进单位之后，更多的与人民群众日常生活有密切联系的单位，都在积极研究消灭群众排队的办法。
