I fully endorse the reports made to the congress by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

From the end of November 1957 to mid-January 1958, I spent fifty days inspecting civil affairs work in Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces. Besides general civil affairs work, I focused on urban social relief work. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce to the representatives the situation I observed in urban social relief. This situation demonstrates that with the great victory of socialist transformation and socialist construction, and amidst the inspiring great leap forward, our country has achieved great accomplishments not only on the production and cultural fronts but also in social relief, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the revolutionary spirit of the masses and civil affairs cadres at all levels.

**The Scope of Urban Social Relief is Shrinking**

After conscientiously implementing the policy of self-reliance through production and mutual assistance among the masses, and with the expansion of construction, employment opportunities for the masses have increased, and urban relief expenses are gradually decreasing.

First, let’s talk about urban social relief. Thanks to the leadership of the Party and government in the three provinces, and the conscientious implementation of the central government’s policy of self-reliance through production and mutual assistance by the civil affairs departments, and also because of the continuous growth of national construction and increased employment opportunities for the working people, the scope of urban social relief has gradually shrunk, and relief expenditures have also gradually decreased. For example, Nanping City in Fujian Province has built cement plants, paper mills, and chemical plants in recent years. Forestry, including logging, sawing, and forest cultivation, requires a large amount of labor, and relief recipients who were able to work have basically found employment. The scope of relief in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanchang, Guangzhou, and other cities has also decreased to varying degrees. In the Antai Street of Gulou District in Fuzhou City, the scope of relief and relief expenses decreased by 10% in 1957 compared to 1956. In Siming District of Xiamen City, there were more than 3,000 households receiving relief in 1955, more than 2,000 households in 1956, and only more than 1,200 households in 1957. Statistics from eleven towns in Guangdong Province show that relief funds have decreased by 44% to 67%.

In the past, civil affairs departments did not rely enough on the masses in their relief work, did not see the strength of mutual assistance among the masses, and were backward and conservative. However, in the past year, many places have launched mass-based economic mutual assistance work. Based on the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, savings mutual assistance groups and mutual assistance savings groups have been organized, relying on the strength of the masses to solve temporary difficulties. In 1957, the Siming Street office in Xiamen started a pilot program of a savings mutual assistance group for cadres of street-level resident committees. The participants were relatively poor, but in less than half a year, they had more than 500 yuan deposited in the bank and lent out 143 yuan, so that the participants no longer had to suffer from the high-interest exploitation of "biao hui" (informal rotating credit associations) and the government's relief burden was reduced. In Heyuan Town, Guangdong, the civil affairs department mobilized residents to save two cents per household per day, accumulating more than 8,000 yuan, which was lent to poor people to raise 2,000 pigs. In Aotou Town, Guangdong, the masses were mobilized to raise 600 yuan to lend to poor people with livelihood difficulties to raise pigs, grow cash crops, and fish. More than 100 poor households no longer engage in smuggling to Hong Kong and no longer require relief. During the fundraising, an old woman voluntarily took out her life savings of 50 yuan that she had saved for her coffin, and another woman who had worked as a "lao ma" (domestic servant) in Hong Kong took out her savings of 100 yuan wrapped in several layers of cloth.

**Many Ways to Organize Production in Cities**

Organizing families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor to participate in small-scale, processing, or service-oriented production, depending on the time, location, and individual circumstances, not only solved their living difficulties and eliminated the need for relief but also accumulated funds for expanding production in many places.

Secondly, regarding organizing families of revolutionary martyrs, the disabled, and the poor to engage in production, during this trip I visited twelve production units for families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor in the four cities of Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanchang, and Guangzhou, and visited two product exhibitions organized by Gulou District in Fuzhou City and Shengli District in Nanchang City. I was deeply impressed by the significant development and remarkable achievements in the work of organizing production by civil affairs departments in various places in the past year or two. According to statistics from ten cities and 116 towns in Guangdong Province, 1,332 production units have been organized, with 76,154 families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor participating in production, and it is estimated that the total number in the province is no less than 100,000. Jiangxi and Fujian provinces have also seen significant growth.

The cadres of the civil affairs departments in various cities have changed their past ideas of engaging in large-scale production and have actively led the families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor to organize various small-scale, processing, and service-oriented production activities, especially organizing many small-scale productions that use waste products as raw materials. For example, the production team in Gulou District, Fuzhou City, uses waste records to make various buttons; the waste recycling factory for families of revolutionary cadres in Fuhe District, Nanchang City, uses scrap cloth cut from underwear factories to piece together schoolbags, hats, clothes, pillows, and gloves, and uses waste cloth and cotton to make linings for cotton-padded clothes (selling this kind of cloth does not require cloth coupons); the textile workshop of the Civil Affairs Comprehensive Factory in Cangshan District, Fuzhou City, and the cotton and wool processing factory in Xiamen use waste cloth, old cotton wadding, and broken fishing nets to make canvas, adult twill, and net bags; the wool recycling and knitting cooperative in Fuhe District, Nanchang City, uses waste blankets to make wool yarn sweaters; the hardware recycling factory in Shengli District, Nanchang City, uses waste iron wire to make iron nails; the paper bag production cooperative for families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor in Beiqu District, Guangzhou, uses waste cement paper bags to make various paper bags. These products are inexpensive, have novel designs, meet the needs of the people, and are in short supply.

There is a wide variety of products made by the families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor, such as: paper clips, thumbtacks, bookbinding nails, wire nails, padlocks, straw hats, embroidery, buttons, children's toys, wooden boxes, thermos bamboo shells, dried tofu, nutritional soy milk, bean curd sticks, silk, processing of broken shoe soles, waste paper sorting and processing, bamboo sheds, sewing, pasting paper boxes, bamboo products, rope making, brick making, coal briquettes, chalk making, cotton batting, grass bags, straw paper, schoolbags, hats, pillows, children's clothes, gloves, cushions, shoe soles, sock soles, wool yarn, sweaters, canvas, net bags, cement paper bags, medicinal paper bags, candy paper bags, paper bags for export goods, cloth bags, alkaline soil, asphalt paint, and other items, totaling no less than one or two hundred kinds. Service-oriented labor includes laundry, delivery, watching bicycles, watching running water, watching paging phones, picking up dry manure, and transcription. In addition, there are agricultural and sideline occupations such as raising pigs, chickens, rabbits, and silkworms, and planting mulberry trees, vegetables, and spiderwort. Facts have proven that as long as we adapt to the time, location, and individual circumstances, investigate local raw materials and sales channels, utilize waste products, actively contact relevant departments, and rely on the masses, there are many ways to organize families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor in cities to engage in production.

Street-level cadres have played a significant role in organizing and leading production. They are familiar with the living and physical conditions of the families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor, and they can actively find ways to generate production. After production is organized, many resident committee directors and resident group leaders are the heads or leaders of the production units and they have a great deal of enthusiasm.

Of the twelve production units I visited, except for three that were newly established or still in the product trial stage, all of them were profitable. Some had paid off their bank loans, and some had accumulated funds for expanding reproduction. The paper bag production cooperative in Beiqu District, Guangzhou (which had no start-up funds and was only given 10,000 old cement paper bags by the team as operating capital) lost 8,000 yuan in 1954 and took out a loan from the bank. In 1955, it made a profit and repaid part of its debt. In 1956, it paid off its debt and still had several thousand yuan left over. In 1957, it made a profit of more than 10,000 yuan, built a factory building, and still had more than 11,000 yuan in public accumulation funds. The wooden box production team in Siming District, Xiamen, only borrowed 800 yuan from the government as start-up capital. It started production in February 1957, and by the end of the year, in addition to paying off the 800 yuan loan, it also purchased a cart and more than 1,000 yuan worth of wood. The waste recycling factory in Fuhe District, Nanchang City, was established in 1956 and earned a net profit of 20,000 yuan in 1957, with the number of employees growing to 115.

The wages in these production units are as high as 50 yuan per month (for technical workers) and as low as 4 yuan (for an elderly woman in her seventies who only does a few hours of light work each day and can arrive late and leave early), but the average is 12 to 30 yuan. Because they have a fixed income and their lives are guaranteed, many relief households participating in production have voluntarily asked to be removed from the relief rolls. In the paper bag production cooperative in Beiqu District, Guangzhou, 80% of the people participating in production were previously relief households, and now only one household with a large population and little labor still needs government relief. Of the 115 people in the hardware recycling factory and other three units in Shengli District, Nanchang City, who originally needed government relief, 82 no longer need relief. One of them, a poor man who used to varnish willow baskets, used to receive 5 to 6 yuan in relief each month, but now his monthly wage income is more than 20 yuan. Not only does he not need relief, but he also has savings in the bank. He said, "My life has entered socialism."

**Great Improvement in the Work of Custodial Institutions**

Vagrants are separately taken in for reform, and the disabled, elderly, and children are also separately taken in for care and education; custodial schools, in the spirit of simplification and thrift, save expenses for the state.

Third, regarding the care and education of the disabled, elderly, orphans, stray children, and abandoned infants, I visited a total of six production and education units: the Fuzhou Infant and Child Care Home, the Fuzhou Blind People's Care Home, the Xiamen Disabled and Elderly Care Home, the Nanchang Children's Care Home, the Nanchang Disabled and Elderly Home, and the Guangzhou Second Children's Care Home.

The work of these custodial institutions has greatly improved in the past year or two. The chaotic phenomenon of mixed custodial care of vagrants, the disabled, elderly, and children has been completely eliminated. Not only have vagrants been separately taken in for reform, but the disabled, elderly, and children have also been separately taken in for care and education. Each custodial unit can carry out its work according to the characteristics of its custodial objects, and the efficiency of custodial work and the level of management have been greatly improved. Guangzhou has also separated general orphans from the stubborn children, such as "afei" (hooligans), petty thieves, and vagrant children, and has them taken in and educated separately by the First and Second Children's Care Homes. Doing so is absolutely necessary in places where conditions permit. (The Second Children's Care Home in Guangzhou has found clues to solving cases from the children it has taken in and provided them to the public security department, solving dozens of cases, including theft cases involving two or three thousand yuan.)

These custodial units generally adhere to the spirit of simplification and thrift, reduce unnecessary administrative management personnel, and save state expenses. The Xiamen Disabled and Elderly Care Home takes in 194 disabled and elderly people (including 8 mentally ill patients). The site is divided into two locations, and there are only seven administrative management personnel, yet the management is very good. The Fuzhou Infant and Child Care Home takes in 270 infants and young children in the home and 170 infants and young children under foster care outside the home. There are only eleven caregivers and seven other management personnel (including the president and vice president). Although there are fewer personnel, the care and nursing work for infants and young children is done well, and the infant and child mortality rate is as low as 1.8%.

These custodial units, with the exception of the infant and child care home, can organize various labor productions suitable for their physical and age conditions according to the different conditions of their custodial objects, cultivate children's labor perspectives, and enliven the lives of the disabled and elderly. Production income not only improves the lives of the disabled, elderly, and children, but also increases material wealth for society. The Xiamen Disabled and Elderly Care Home has organized pig-raising groups, chicken-raising groups, matchbox-pasting groups, shoe-making groups, and chalk-making groups according to the interests, physical strength, and expertise of the disabled and elderly in the home. In addition, they also grow vegetables and beans. From January 1 to December 10, 1957, the total production income was 10,012 yuan. After deducting production expenses of more than 4,600 yuan, there was a surplus of more than 6,400 yuan. 1,800 yuan was distributed to the disabled and elderly as a subsidy for pocket money, and the remaining more than 3,500 yuan was used for collective welfare expenses and deposited in the bank. Over the years, the savings deposited in the bank have reached 25,000 yuan.

The above is a brief introduction to the situation of urban social relief work during my inspection.

**A Great Leap Forward in Urban Relief Work is Possible**

1.  Continue to vigorously organize families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor to participate in production, making them local industrial organizational units, reducing relief households to a minimum, and ensuring that "every household in the city has a job and every family engages in production." 2. Vigorously promote mutual assistance among the masses to solve livelihood difficulties and establish various mutual aid organizations; it is recommended that relevant parties in various places actively cooperate to promote them.

The many facts I saw during this inspection made me deeply feel that our country is full of vigorous and fresh vitality, and the socialist consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses are unprecedentedly high. Even in social relief work, among the poor relief households and the disabled, elderly, and orphans, people are actively tapping potential, turning uselessness into usefulness, transforming negative factors into positive factors, implementing the spirit of running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, and striving to contribute every ounce of strength to socialist construction. In order to enable urban social relief work to catch up with the great leap forward, I would like to propose two immature suggestions for the representatives to study and correct.

1.  We should firmly implement the policy of self-reliance through production in social relief work and continue to vigorously organize families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor in cities to participate in production. Facts in recent years have proven that organizing the poor families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor in cities to engage in production and self-reliance not only enables the families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor facing livelihood difficulties to get rid of unemployment and poverty and reduces the government's relief expenditure, but also these small-scale processing and service-oriented productions have played a certain role in supporting industrial and agricultural production and supplying the needs of the people's lives, becoming a component of local industry. In the future, we should further give play to the enthusiasm of all families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor in cities who want to participate in socialist construction. It is recommended that the civil affairs departments, handicraft management departments, commercial departments (department stores, food companies, pharmaceutical companies, etc.), and relevant departments such as factories, mines, enterprises, and troops in various provinces and cities cooperate closely under the leadership of the local Party committees and people's committees, draw up plans, and within a certain period of time, organize all those among the families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor in cities who are able to participate in production (Shenyang, Changchun, Changsha, and other cities have already done so), reduce the number of relief households in cities to a minimum, and ensure that "every household in the city has a job and every family engages in production," and "every family is busy with production and there are no idle people in any household."

2.  We should overcome the backward and conservative ideas of not relying on the mutual assistance of the masses in past relief work and vigorously promote the masses to rely on their own mutual assistance to solve their livelihood difficulties, and organize mass-based mutual assistance organizations such as mutual assistance savings groups, savings mutual assistance groups, and economic mutual assistance groups based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. This kind of mass mutual assistance organization not only exists in the towns mentioned in the report above, but has also been launched in many cities, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Shijiazhuang. Facts have proven that this kind of mass mutual assistance organization is an effective way to mobilize the urban residents to solve their own difficulties through mutual assistance. It is also of great significance for implementing the principle of diligence and thrift in managing households, accumulating social idle funds, and reducing government relief expenditure. It is recommended that in cities across the country where this kind of mass mutual assistance has not been held, the civil affairs departments cooperate with relevant departments such as the women's federations and banks to conduct pilot programs, gain experience, and actively promote it.

    生产自救　群众互助
    勤俭办一切社会救济事业
    内务部副部长陈其瑗谈视察福建、江西、广东三省社会救济工作的情况和建议
    我完全拥护李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任向大会所作的报告。
    我曾于一九五七年十一月底至一九五八年一月中旬五十天期间，到福建、江西、广东三省视察了民政工作，除了一般的民政工作外，有重点地视察城市社会救济工作。现在我想趁此机会把视察当中看到的城市社会救济事业方面的情况，向代表们简单介绍一下。这些情况说明了随着社会主义改造和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，我们的国家在振奋人心的大跃进形势下，不仅在生产战线上、文化战线上取得了很大的成就，而且在社会救济事业方面，同样由于党的正确领导，由于群众和各级民政干部的革命干劲而取得了新的发展。
    城市社会救济面在缩小
    认真执行生产自救和群众互助的方针以后，随着建设事业的壮大，群众就业的机会增多，城市救济费用逐渐在减少。
    首先谈谈城市社会救济方面。由于三省党政的领导，民政部门认真贯彻了中央生产自救、群众互助的救济工作方针，又由于国家建设事业不断增长扩大，劳动人民就业的机会增多，城市社会救济面逐渐缩小，救济费的开支也逐渐在减少。例如福建省南平市近两年来新建了水泥厂、纸厂、化工厂，林业方面砍伐、锯木、育林都需要大批劳动力，过去有就业条件的救济对象都基本上就了业。福州、厦门、南昌、广州等市的救济面都有不同程度的下降。福州市鼓楼区安泰街一九五七年比一九五六年救济面及救济费下降了百分之十。厦门市思明区一九五五年救济对象有三千多户，一九五六年是二千多户，一九五七年只有一千二百多户了。广东省十一个市镇统计救济款减少了百分之四十四至六十七。
    过去民政部门在救济工作上依靠群众不够，看不见群众互助的力量，落后保守。但是近一年来有许多地方已经开展了群众性的经济互助工作。根据群众自愿的原则，组织了储蓄互助小组、互助储金小组，依靠群众的力量解决群众的临时困难问题。厦门思明街办事处一九五七年开始试办街道基层居民委员会的干部储蓄互助小组，参加的人是比较有困难的，但不够半年，已有五百多块钱存银行，借出了一百四十三元，使参加小组的人不必再受“标会”的高利剥削，也减少了政府的救济。广东河源镇民政部门发动居民每户每天积二分钱，共积蓄了八千多元，贷给贫民养猪二千头。广东澳头镇发动群众自行凑集资金六百元，贷给生活困难的贫民养猪、种经济作物、捕鱼，有一百多户贫民再不到香港走私，也不要救济了。在群众筹集资金当中，有一个老妇人把她积蓄多年的棺材本五十元，另有一个曾经在香港当老妈的把她的用几层布包起来的积蓄一百元，都自动拿了出来。
    城市组织生产门路很多
    因时、因地、因人制宜，组织烈军属和贫民参加小型、加工性或服务性的生产，不仅解决了生活困难，不要救济了，许多地方还积累了扩大生产资金。
    其次，在组织烈军属、残废者、贫民生产方面，我此次在福州、厦门、南昌、广州四个市访问了十二个烈军属、贫民生产单位，参观了福州市鼓楼区和南昌市胜利区举办的两个烈军属、贫民生产产品展览会，深深感到近一、二年来，各地民政部门组织生产的工作有了很大的开展，成绩很显著。根据广东省十个市、一百一十六个镇统计，组织了生产单位一千三百三十二个，参加生产的烈军属、贫民有七万六千一百五十四人，估计全省不下十万人。江西、福建两省也有大量的发展。
    各市民政部门的干部改变了过去搞大生产的思想，积极领导烈军属、贫民组织了各种各样小型的、加工性、服务性的生产，特别是组织了不少利用废品废料为原料的小型生产，例如福州市鼓楼区生产小组利用废唱片制各种各样的钮扣；南昌抚河区革属（革命干部家属）废料复制厂利用内衣厂剪下的碎布拼制成书包、帽子、衣服、枕头、手套等，利用废布废棉制成棉衣里布（卖此种布不收布票）；福州仓山区民政综合工厂纺织工场、厦门棉毛加工厂利用废布、旧棉胎、破鱼网制成帆布、大人字呢、网袋等；南昌抚河区毛绒复制编织社利用废毯制成毛线毛衣；南昌胜利区五金复制厂利用废铁丝制铁钉；广州北区烈军属贫民纸袋生产社利用废旧水泥纸袋制各种纸袋。这些产品价格低廉，式样新颖，适合需要，供不应求。
    烈军属、贫民生产的产品种类非常繁多，例如：回形针、图画钉、装书钉、洋钉、洋锁、草帽、刺绣、钮扣、儿童玩具、木箱、暖水瓶竹壳、豆腐干、营养豆奶、腐竹、蚕丝、破鞋底加工、废纸分类加工、竹篷、缝纫、糊纸盒、竹器、制绳、制砖、制煤球、制粉笔、弹棉、草袋、草纸、书包、帽子、枕头、小孩衣服、手套、坐垫、鞋底、袜底、毛线、毛衣、帆布、网袋、水泥纸袋、药材纸袋、糖果纸袋、出口物资纸袋、布袋、土碱、柏油漆等不下百数十种。服务性的劳动有洗衣、送货、看自行车、看自来水、看传呼电话、拾干粪、誊写等。此外，还有养猪、鸡、兔、蚕，种桑、种菜、种龙爪兰等农牧副业。事实证明，只要因时、因地、因人制宜，调查当地原料和销路，利用废品废料，积极和有关部门联系，依靠群众，城市里组织烈军属、贫民生产的门路是很多的。
    街道基层干部在组织领导生产上起了很大作用，他们熟悉烈军属、贫民生活体力等情况，又能动脑筋积极找门路，生产组织起来以后，许多居民委员会主任、居民小组长都是生产单位的社长或组长，干劲很大。
    我所看过的十二个生产单位中，除了三个是刚成立或尚在试制产品阶段的以外，都是有盈余的。有的还清了银行的贷款，有的积累了扩大再生产资金。广州市北区纸袋生产社，（没有开办经费，仅仅由队给了一万个旧的洋灰纸袋作为办社资金）一九五四年亏了八千元，向银行贷款。一九五五年有盈余，还了一部分债款。一九五六年还清了债务，仍余几千元。一九五七年盈余一万余元，盖了一间厂房，还有公积金一万一千多元。厦门思明区木箱生产小组成立时，政府只贷了八百元作为开办资金，一九五七年二月开始生产，到年底，除已还清了贷款八百元以外，还购了一辆板车和一千多元木料。南昌抚河区废料复制厂一九五六年开办，一九五七年获纯利二万元，人数发展到一百一十五人。
    这些生产单位的工资，最高的每月有五十余元（技术工人），最低的四元（七十多岁老太婆，每天只干几小时轻活，可以迟到早退），一般的是十二元至三十元。由于有了固定收入，生活有了保障，许多参加生产的救济户自动提出不要救济了。广州市北区纸袋生产社参加生产人员百分之八十过去是救济户，现在只剩一户人口多劳力少的家庭还需要政府救济。南昌胜利区五金复制厂等三个单位，原来需政府救济的一百一十五人当中，有八十二人不必救济了，其中有一个漆柳条筐的贫民，过去每月要领救济款五至六元，现在每月工资收入二十余元，不仅不要救济，银行还有存款，他说：“我的生活已到了社会主义了”。
    教养单位工作改进很大
    游民另行收容改造，残老和儿童也分别收容教养；教养学校本着精简节约的精神，为国家节省开支。
    第三，在残老、孤儿、流浪儿、弃婴的收容教养方面，我总共看了六个生产教养单位：福州市婴幼教养院，福州市盲人教养院，厦门市残老教养院，南昌市儿童教养所、南昌市残老所，广州市第二儿童教养院。
    这些教养单位的工作近一、二年来有了很大改进，已经完全消除了过去游民、残老、儿童混合收容教养时的混乱现象，不但游民已另行收容改造，而且残老和儿童也分别收容教养。各个教养单位都能按照自己收容对象的特点进行工作，教养工作的效率和管理的水平都已大大提高。广州市还把一般孤儿和阿飞、小偷、小流氓等顽劣儿童隔开，分别由第一、第二儿童教养院收容教养，在有条件的地方，这样做是完全必要的。（广州市第二儿童教养院，从收容的儿童身上找到破案线索，供给公安部门，破了几十个案子，其中有二、三千元的盗窃案。）
    这些教养单位一般都能本着精简节约的精神，减少不必要的行政管理人员，以节省国家的开支。厦门市残老院收容残老一百九十四人（其中包括精神病者八人），院址分设两处，行政管理人员只有七人，也管理得很不错。福州市婴幼教养院，院内收养婴幼儿二百七十名，院外托养一百七十名。只有保育员十一人，其他管理人员七人（包括正副院长），人员虽较少，但对婴幼儿的护养工作还做得不错，婴幼儿死亡率低至百分之一点八。
    这些教养单位，除了婴幼院外，其余的残老、盲人、儿童单位都能按照收容对象的不同情况，组织各种适合身体、年龄条件的劳动生产，培养儿童的劳动观点，活跃残老人员的生趣。生产收入不仅改善了残老、儿童的生活，而且还为社会增加了物质财富。厦门市残老院按照院内残老的兴趣、体力和专长，组织了养猪组、养鸡组、糊火柴盒组、制鞋组、制粉笔组，此外还种蔬菜、豆类等。一九五七年一月至十二月十日，生产总收入有一万零一十二元，除生产费用四千六百余元，尚余六千四百余元，发了一千八百元给残老补贴零用，其余三千五百余元作为集体福利开支，存放银行，几年来节余款存银行已有二万五千元。
    以上就是我此次视察城市社会救济工作情况的简单介绍。
    城市救济工作能大跃进
    一、继续大力组织烈军属、贫民参加生产，使之成为地方工业组织部门，把救济户减少到最低限度，使城镇中“户户有职业，家家搞生产”。二、大力提倡群众依靠互助，解决生活困难，建立各种互助组织；建议各地有关方面互相配合积极推广。
    这次视察当中所见到的许许多多事实，使我深深感到我们的国家到处是一片蓬蓬勃勃的新鲜活泼的朝气，群众的社会主义觉悟和革命干劲空前高涨，即使在社会救济事业方面，在贫困的救济户和残老孤幼中间，也在积极挖掘潜力，化无用为有用，变消极因素为积极因素，贯彻勤俭办一切事业的精神和多、快、好、省的方针，要求发挥每一分力量贡献给社会主义建设事业。为了使城市社会救济工作赶上大跃进的形势，我想提出两点不成熟的意见，请代表们研究指正。
    一、应该坚定地贯彻社会救济工作中的生产自救的方针，继续大力组织城市烈军属、贫民参加生产。几年来的事实证明，组织城市中贫苦烈军属、贫民生产自救不仅仅使生活有困难的烈军属、贫民摆脱了失业和贫困，减少了政府救济费的开支，而且这些小型的加工性服务性的生产对支援工农业生产和供应人民生活需要发挥了一定的作用，成为地方工业的一个组成部分。今后更应该发挥所有城市烈军属、贫民要求参加社会主义建设的积极性。建议各省、市民政部门和手工业管理部门、商业部门（百货公司、食品公司、药材公司等）、和厂矿企业部队等有关方面密切配合，在当地党委人委领导下，订出规划，在一定的时期内，把城市烈军属、贫民当中有条件参加生产的人全部组织到生产中去（沈阳、长春、长沙等城市已经这样做了），把城市中的救济户减少到最低限度，做到在城镇中“户户有职业，家家搞生产”，“家家忙生产，户户无闲人”。
    二、应该克服过去救济工作中不依靠群众互助力量的落后保守思想，大力提倡群众依靠自己互助的力量，解决自己生活上的困难，在自愿、互利的原则下组织互助储金小组，储蓄互助小组，经济互助组等群众性的互助组织。这种群众互助组织，不仅在上面的报告中提到的市镇中已经有了，在不少城市当中，如北京、天津、武汉、石家庄等市都已经开展了起来。事实已经证明，这种群众互助组织是发动城市居民群众互助力量解决自己困难的一种有效的方式。对贯彻勤俭持家的方针，积累社会游资和减少政府救济费支出，也有很大意义。建议全国没有举办这种群众互助的城市，民政部门和妇联、银行等有关方面配合起来，通过试办，取得经验，积极推广。
