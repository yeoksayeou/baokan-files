Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, February 5th: The head of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation, B. Gafurov, currently visiting Pakistan, stated at a press conference held here on the 4th that Pakistan has given assurances that "Pakistan will not allow foreign countries to establish atomic weapons bases on its territory."

B. Gafurov also said that "Pakistani government leaders and members of the National Assembly have said that Pakistan hopes to live in peace and friendship with the Soviet Union and will never allow its territory to be used for aggression against the Soviet Union."

The Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation has been visiting here for more than two weeks at the invitation of the Pakistani National Assembly. During this period, they exchanged views with the Pakistani President and Prime Minister, as well as other leaders.

B. Gafurov also said at the press conference: "The foreign policy of the Soviet government aims to achieve peaceful coexistence between all countries, regardless of their social systems."

He also said: "At the same time, we see that certain foreign imperialist groups are attempting to use the military treaties they have created to obstruct the easing of international tensions, to divert the attention of those countries that have freed themselves from the shackles of colonialism from solving their own domestic problems, and to hinder the development of friendly relations between these countries and the Soviet Union."

B. Gafurov said: "We understand the difficulties Pakistan faces in its economic development. The delegation has long indicated that the Soviet Union is ready to provide technical assistance to Pakistan on a bilateral basis or through the United Nations."

He concluded: "If the Pakistani government wishes to receive such assistance, it can be assured that the Soviet government will give full consideration to this request."

　　巴基斯坦向苏联最高苏维埃代表团保证
    不许外国在本土建立原子基地
    新华社卡拉奇5日电　正在巴基斯坦访问的苏联最高苏维埃代表团团长别?吉克托夫4日在这里举行的记者招待会上说，巴基斯坦已经提出保证，“巴基斯坦将不容许外国在它的领土上建立原子武器基地”。
    别?吉克托夫又说，“巴基斯坦政府领导人和国民议会议员们曾经说，巴基斯坦希望同苏联和平友好相处，并且永远不容许它的领土被利用来侵略苏联。”
    苏联最高苏维埃代表团应巴基斯坦国民议会的邀请已经在这里访问了两个多星期。在这期间，他们同巴基斯坦总统和总理以及其他领导人交换了意见。
    别?吉克托夫在记者招待会上又说：“苏联政府的外交政策的目的是为了实现各国之间的和平共处，不管它们的社会制度如何。”
    他还说：“同时，我们看到，某些外国帝国主义集团企图利用它们所制造出来的军事条约，来阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，转移那些已经摆脱殖民主义枷锁的国家对解决本国问题的注意力，并且阻碍这些国家同苏联的友好关系的发展。”
    别?吉克托夫说：“我们了解巴基斯坦在经济发展中所面临的困难。代表团早就表明，苏联准备在双边的基础上或通过联合国向巴基斯坦提供技术援助。”
    他最后说：“如果巴基斯坦政府希望得到这种援助的话，它可以相信，苏联政府将充分地考虑这个要求”。
