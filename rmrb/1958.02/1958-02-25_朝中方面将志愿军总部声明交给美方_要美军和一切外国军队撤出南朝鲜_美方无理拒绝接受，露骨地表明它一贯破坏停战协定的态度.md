Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, February 24th - At the suggestion of the Korean and Chinese side, the Military Armistice Commission held a meeting at 12:00 noon today. At the meeting, the Chief Member of the Korean and Chinese side, Major General Jiang Shanghao, handed the U.S. side the statement from the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers regarding the complete withdrawal of the Volunteers from Korea and demanded that the U.S. side withdraw U.S. troops and all foreign troops from South Korea.

At the meeting, the U.S. side unreasonably refused to accept the statement of the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers and refused to discuss the demand put forward by the Korean and Chinese side for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and other foreign troops from South Korea. Major General Jiang Shanghao finally asked the U.S. side to reconsider carefully the proactive measures taken by the Chinese People's Volunteers.

At the meeting, Jiang Shanghao pointed out that the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on February 5th, proposing a plan for the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, the implementation of free elections throughout Korea, and the realization of peaceful reunification of Korea. The Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on February 7th, expressing full support for the above-mentioned statement, and after consultation with the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, proposed to the Chinese People's Volunteers the suggestion of proactively withdrawing from Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers fully agreed with the suggestion of the Chinese government and decided to withdraw from Korea in batches before the end of 1958.

Jiang Shanghao said: "This decision and statement of the Chinese People's Volunteers vividly demonstrates that since the armistice, our side has strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement and has consistently made and continues to make efforts to lead the armistice towards a consolidated peace so that Korea can achieve peaceful reunification and the situation in the Far East can be eased."

Jiang Shanghao pointed out that the proactive measure of withdrawing the Chinese People's Volunteers has opened up a new and realistic path for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and for maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East.

Jiang Shanghao emphasized: "In contrast, your side is stepping up the implementation of American colonial policies and war preparations policies in South Korea; especially recently, your side has seriously violated the Armistice Agreement by transporting in atomic weapons and other military weapons and atomic units, turning South Korea into an American atomic weapons and rocket base. I firmly demand that your side immediately stop the above-mentioned actions which seriously violate the Armistice Agreement, threaten peace, create huge obstacles on the road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and intensify the tense situation in the Far East."

Jiang Shanghao demanded that the U.S. side should also adopt a positive attitude towards the most reasonable and realistic measures now being taken by the Korean and Chinese side, and should withdraw U.S. troops and all other foreign troops from South Korea.

Jiang Shanghao said: "If your side has the slightest concern for resolving the Korean issue, you should do so. There is no reason for the American imperialist invading army and other foreign troops to remain in South Korea."

Jiang Shanghao concluded: "Now is a moment of serious test for your side to see whether you are sincerely for the peaceful reunification of Korea or whether you want to invade Korea and turn it into a colony of the United States, turning South Korea into an American atomic war base. If your side does not withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea and withdraw all other foreign troops participating in the so-called 'United Nations Forces', then the people of the world will see more clearly that your side has always been obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea."

At the meeting, the U.S. side, using the excuse that it was not within the scope of the work of the Military Armistice Commission, refused to accept the statement of the Chinese People's Volunteers regarding the withdrawal of troops, and refused to discuss the issue raised by the Korean and Chinese side.

Major General Jiang Shanghao immediately pointed out at the meeting that the statement of the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers regarding the withdrawal of the Volunteers from Korea is of great significance for realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea and easing the tense situation in Korea, and this cannot but be a matter of concern to both sides of the Military Armistice Commission. Jiang Shanghao said that today, your side refused to accept this statement with an unreasonable excuse, which blatantly demonstrates your consistent attitude of undermining the Armistice Agreement and exposes your aggressive ambitions in front of the people of the world. Your attitude once again clearly shows that your side does not care at all about the peaceful reunification of Korea, and therefore your attitude is a violation of the spirit and relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement.

In order to confuse public opinion, divert attention, and evade the issue of troop withdrawal raised by the Korean and Chinese side, the U.S. side instead raised at the meeting the unreasonable demand to the Korean and Chinese side to "return" the South Korean civil aviation plane and personnel on board who had revolted and came to northern Korea on the 16th. Jiang Shanghao pointed out in this regard that the Korean and Chinese side had already clarified its position on the issue of the revolting plane; regarding the issue of some of the personnel on board the revolting plane who came to northern Korea wanting to return home, if the South Korean authorities care about their wishes, they should directly negotiate and deal with the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Jiang Shanghao emphasized that now the U.S. side is trying to oppose this legitimate solution, obviously to deceive world opinion in order to achieve some ulterior political motives.

### 朝中方面将志愿军总部声明交给美方  要美军和一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜  美方无理拒绝接受，露骨地表明它一贯破坏停战协定的态度

    朝中方面将志愿军总部声明交给美方
    要美军和一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜
    美方无理拒绝接受，露骨地表明它一贯破坏停战协定的态度
    新华社板门店24日电　在朝中方面建议下，军事停战委员会今天中午十二时举行会议。朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将在会上把中国人民志愿军总部关于志愿军将全部从朝鲜撤出的声明交给美方，并且要求美方从南朝鲜撤出美国军队以及一切外国军队。
    美方在会上无理拒绝接受志愿军总部的声明，并且拒绝讨论朝中方面提出的要求美军和其他外国军队从南朝鲜撤出的问题。姜尚昊少将最后要求美方再次慎重考虑中国人民志愿军所采取的主动措施。
    姜尚昊少将在会上指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在2月5日发表声明，提出了一切外国军队同时撤出朝鲜、实行全朝鲜的自由选举、实现朝鲜和平统一的方案。中华人民共和国政府在2月7日发表声明对上述声明表示完全支持，并且在同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府磋商以后，向中国人民志愿军提出主动撤出朝鲜的建议。中国人民志愿军完全赞同中国政府的建议，决定在1958年年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜。
    姜尚昊说：“中国人民志愿军的这一决定和声明生动地表明，我方自停战以来严格遵守停战协定，并且为把停战导向巩固的和平以使朝鲜得到和平统一，使远东局势得到和缓而一贯地进行了并正在继续进行着努力。”
    姜尚昊指出，关于撤出中国人民志愿军的这一主动措施，为和平解决朝鲜问题以及维持和巩固远东和平打开了新的现实的途径。
    姜尚昊强调指出：“与此相反，你方却在南朝鲜加紧推行美国殖民主义政策和备战政策；特别是在最近，你方严重破坏停战协定，运入原子武器等各种军事武器和原子部队，把南朝鲜变成美国原子武器和火箭基地。我坚决要求你方立即停止上述严重破坏停战协定、威胁和平、在和平解决朝鲜问题的道路上制造巨大障碍和加紧远东紧张局势的行动。”
    姜尚昊要求美方也应当对朝中方面现在所采取的最合理、最现实的措施采取积极的态度，并且应当从南朝鲜撤出美国军队等一切外国军队。
    姜尚昊说：“如果你方对于解决朝鲜问题有丝毫的关心，你方就应当这样做，美帝国主义侵略军队和其他外国军队没有任何理由留在南朝鲜。”
    姜尚昊最后说：“现在正是严重考验你方的时刻，看看你方究竟是有诚意和平统一朝鲜呢，还是要侵略朝鲜把它变为美国的殖民地，把南朝鲜变成美国的原子战争基地。如果你方不从南朝鲜撤出美国军队和撤出参加所谓‘联合国军’的所有其他外国军队，那么，全世界人民就会更清楚地看到，你方始终阻挠朝鲜的和平统一。”
    美方在会上以不属于军事停战委员会的工作范围为借口，拒绝接受中国人民志愿军关于撤军的声明，拒绝对朝中方面提出的问题进行讨论。
    姜尚昊少将在会上当即指出，中国人民志愿军总部关于从朝鲜撤出志愿军的声明，对于实现朝鲜的和平统一和在朝鲜缓和紧张局势都具有重大的意义，这不能不成为军事停战委员会双方所关心的事情。姜尚昊说，今天，你方以无理的借口拒绝接受这个声明，这露骨地表明了你方一贯破坏停战协定的态度，并且在全世界人民面前暴露了你方的侵略野心。你方的这种态度又一次清楚地表明你方对朝鲜的和平统一丝毫也不关心，因而你方的这种态度是违背停战协定的精神和有关条款的行为。
    美方为了混淆舆论转移视线，规避朝中方面提出的撤军问题，却在会上提出了要朝中方面“归还”16日起义到朝鲜北部来的南朝鲜民航飞机和飞机上的人员的无理要求。姜尚昊就此指出，关于起义的飞机问题，朝中方面早已阐明了自己的立场；关于乘坐起义飞机前来朝鲜北部的人员中有人希望回家的问题，南朝鲜当局如果关心他们的愿望，就应该同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府直接交涉处理。姜尚昊强调指出，现在美方力图反对这一正当解决办法，显然是要欺骗世界舆论，以达到某种不可告人的政治目的。
