　　Promote the Use of Public Chopsticks!

    Anhui Province's patriotic health campaign has added a new element, which is to gradually promote the public chopsticks system throughout the province (see People's Daily, February 8). This is a great event of changing customs and habits that is extremely beneficial to the people's health.
    The public chopsticks system is the simplest and easiest to implement, and is suitable for public canteens and ordinary families. Just prepare an extra pair (or several pairs) of chopsticks and a spoon (or several spoons). Everyone uses the public chopsticks to pick food into their own bowl, and then use their own chopsticks to eat. These public chopsticks are actually equivalent to a kind of isolator.
    At present, many canteens in government agencies, schools, enterprises, and factories, and some families have already implemented the public chopsticks system (many units have even implemented separate dining systems). Cadres and people in these places have become accustomed to using public chopsticks, reducing or avoiding the spread of diseases, and improving their health levels. In Qile Agricultural Cooperative in Lechang County, Guangdong Province, every household has developed the habit of using public chopsticks. Ling Yun's family of five in Wulaocun, Nanjing, has been using public chopsticks for more than four years, and even the youngest child has developed the habit of using public chopsticks. Last spring, the flu was very serious in Nanjing. Ling Yun's eldest child contracted a cold at school. Because the whole family paid attention to isolation and used public chopsticks, the cold was not transmitted to others.
    However, for most people, using public chopsticks is still something they are not very used to. The Chinese people have been using chopsticks for eating for two or three thousand years. According to the "Examination of Social Customs and Things of Past Dynasties," people in the Zhou Dynasty held rice in their hands and used chopsticks very little; by the Han Dynasty, chopsticks were commonly used. From eating with hands to eating with chopsticks, it can be said to be a great improvement. The current proposal of the public chopsticks system makes the diet of the broad masses of people more hygienic and reduces or avoids the spread of diseases, which is another great improvement.
    The broad masses of Chinese working people were oppressed by the reactionary ruling class and were in a state of long-term hunger and cold, seeking only to fill their stomachs, and had no energy to pay attention to hygiene. After liberation, the lives of the working people have gradually improved, and dietary hygiene has improved compared to the past. However, for a long time, it has been common for several people to eat from the same dishes in families and public canteens, and everyone does not feel that there is anything unhygienic about it. Many diseases are spread through the mouth. If the public chopsticks system is not implemented, it will give germs a very wide opportunity to take advantage of, and our health cannot be fully guaranteed.
    Some people say, "Chinese people have always loved to eat together, will using public chopsticks reduce this atmosphere of joy?" This worry is unnecessary. Whether using public chopsticks or eating separately, you can still sit together and eat, which will not reduce the joy of gathering at all. If the whole family does not get sick or gets sick less often because of this, wouldn't that be even greater joy?

### 推广公筷制！

　　推广公筷制！
　　又青
    安徽省的爱国卫生运动增加了一项新内容，就是在全省范围内逐步推行公筷制（见2月8日的人民日报），这是一件对人民健康极为有益的移风易俗的大事情。
    公筷制是最简单易行的，适合于公共食堂和普通家庭。只要多预备一双（或几双）筷子，一把（或数把）菜匙，就行了。大家用公筷把菜夹到自己的碗里，然后再用自己的筷子吃饭。这公筷实际就等于一种隔离器。
    目前，许多机关、学校、企业、工厂的食堂和一部分家庭已经实行公筷制（有不少单位更实行了分食制），这些地方的干部和人民使用公筷已经成为习惯，减少或避免了疾病的传染，提高了健康水平。广东省乐昌县岐乐农业社家家户户都养成了使用公筷的习惯。南京市五老村凌云一家五口，使用公筷四年多，连最小的孩子也养成了使用公筷的习惯，去年春天，南京市全城流行性感冒十分严重，凌云的大孩子在学校里传染了感冒，由于全家都注意隔离，使用公筷，感冒没有传染给别人。
    但是，使用公筷对大部分人来说，还是一件不大习惯的事情。中国人民吃饭用筷相传已有二三千年的历史，据“历代社会风俗事物考”记载，周时人民以手捧饭，用筷极少；到汉代就普遍用筷了。从用手抓饭到用筷吃饭，可以说是一大进步，现在提出的公筷制，使广大人民饮食更加讲求卫生，减少或避免疾病的传染，这又是一大进步。
    我国广大劳动人民受反动统治阶级的压迫，长期处于饥寒交迫的境地，但求饱肚而已，哪里还有余力讲求卫生？解放以后，劳动人民的生活逐步提高，饮食卫生比过去有所改善，但是，长期以来，在家庭和公共食堂里，几个人同吃几个菜，已经习以为常，大家不觉得有什么不卫生。而许多疾病，是从口腔传染开去的，如果不实行公筷制，就给病菌以非常广泛的可乘之隙，我们的健康也就不能得到充分的保证了。
    有人说：“中国人一向爱团聚在一起吃饭，用了公筷，会不会减少这种欢聚的气氛？”这种耽心是多余的。无论是用公筷也好，分食也好，还是可以团坐在一起吃饭，丝毫不会减少欢聚的乐趣。如果一家人都因此不生病或少生病，岂不是更大的欢乐么？
