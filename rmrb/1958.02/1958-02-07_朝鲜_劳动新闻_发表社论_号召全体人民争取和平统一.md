Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 6th. The Korean "Labor News" published an editorial today stating that the Korean government's statement of February 5th is of historical significance for consolidating peace in Korea and the struggle for the peaceful reunification of Korea. The statement demonstrated the sincere efforts of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The editorial strongly condemned the American aggressor group's repeated opposition to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The editorial emphasized that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is a prerequisite for resolving the Korean issue. The Korean issue can only be peacefully resolved by the Korean people themselves in accordance with their free will. The editorial stated that the Korean Armistice Agreement clearly stipulates the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. This issue has matured today. The editorial said that because U.S. troops are forcibly occupying South Korea, peace in Korea is threatened and the peaceful reunification of Korea is obstructed. The disruptors of peace – U.S. troops – should get out of Korea.

The editorial said that there can be no true free elections in the absence of legal guarantees for democracy and freedom. The editorial said that the South Korean authorities should immediately stop suppressing political party activities and restricting freedom of speech in South Korea.

The editorial called on all patriotic political parties, social organizations, political activists, and people in North Korea to step forward under the banner of peaceful reunification, resolutely carry out the struggle to complete national independence, eliminate the state of national division as soon as possible, and force the U.S. troops to withdraw from Korea as soon as possible.

　　朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论
    号召全体人民争取和平统一
    新华社平壤6日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论说，朝鲜政府2月5日发表的声明对巩固朝鲜和平和和平统一朝鲜的斗争是具有历史意义的。这项声明表明了朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府对和平解决朝鲜问题而进行的诚挚的努力。社论强烈地谴责美国侵略集团一再反对和平解决朝鲜问题的行为。
    社论强调说，一切外国军队撤出朝鲜是解决朝鲜问题的先决条件。朝鲜问题只能由朝鲜人民自己根据他们的自由意志加以和平解决。社论说，朝鲜停战协定明确规定要从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。今天这个问题已经成熟了。社论说，由于美军强占着南朝鲜，朝鲜的和平受到威胁，朝鲜的和平统一遭到阻挠。和平的扰乱者——美军应该滚出朝鲜。
    社论说，在民主和自由没有法律上的保障的情况下是不可能有真正的自由选举的。社论说，应该立即停止南朝鲜当局在南朝鲜镇压政党活动和限制言论自由的活动。
    社论号召全朝鲜爱国的政党、社会团体、政治活动家和人民在和平统一的旗帜下挺身向前，坚决进行斗争，以完成民族独立，早日消除国家分裂状态，迫使美军早日撤出朝鲜。
