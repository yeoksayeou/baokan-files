Xinhua News Agency, London, February 9th. Four thousand people gathered in London's Albert Hall today to protest the stationing of US troops and the establishment of rocket bases in Britain. The rally was organized to celebrate the twenty-eighth anniversary of the founding of the British "Daily Worker."

    John Gollan, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, spoke at the meeting, pointing out the serious danger to the British people posed by the American rocket bases being built in Britain and the hydrogen bomb-carrying bombers circling over British skies. Gollan said, "A unilateral decision by the United States, or even an error by a nervous American pilot, could erase the line between peace and nuclear disaster."

    Gollan said that some tell us that it is the United States' destiny to "lead" the world. But the "leadership" that the United States gives the world today is only Dulles, the dollar, and destruction. This remark elicited a burst of laughter and applause of approval.

    He said that Norway, Denmark, and Belgium had the courage to refuse the United States the establishment of rocket bases on their territory, while only Britain rushed to Washington to sign a suicidal rocket treaty.

    When he demanded that American troops return home immediately, the audience applauded him for a long time. He said that the Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" believes that the United States Air Force only occupies thirty-seven square miles of British land, but "we are not willing to give them even thirty-seven inches of land."

    Gollan called for a top-level meeting to promote peace. He said, "If Dulles is unwilling to talk with the Russians, then Britain should cast him aside and hold talks on its own. If the Conservative Party is unwilling to hold talks, let it step down and establish a government willing to hold talks." He called on the British labor movement to unite.

    伦敦集会抗议美在英设火箭基地
    高兰要求举行最高级会议以促进和平
    新华社伦敦9日电　今天有四千人在伦敦艾伯特大厅举行大会，抗议美国在英国驻扎军队和建立火箭基地。这个大会是为庆祝英国“工人日报”创刊二十八周年而组织的。
    英国共产党总书记约翰·高兰在会上讲了话，他指出正在英国修建的美国火箭基地和在英国上空盘旋的携有氢弹的轰炸机对英国人民的严重危险。高兰说：“美国的片面决定，或者那怕是神经紧张的美国驾驶员的一个差错，都能够抹去和平和核灾难之间的一线之差。”
    高兰说，有人对我们说，美国“领导”世界是它命中注定的。但是，美国今天给予世界的“领导”只有杜勒斯、美元和破坏。他的这段话引起了表示赞同的一阵笑声和掌声。
    他说，挪威、丹麦、比利时都有勇气拒绝美国在它们的领土上设置火箭基地，只有英国赶到华盛顿去签订自杀的火箭条约。
    当他要求美国军队马上回国的时候，听众向他长时间地鼓掌。他说，保守党的“每日电讯报”认为，美国空军只占领了三十七平方英里的英国土地，但是“我们连三十七英寸的土地也不愿给他们”。
    高兰要求举行最高级会议以促进和平。他说：“如果杜勒斯不愿意同俄国人会谈，那么英国就抛开他而径自举行会谈。如果保守党不愿举行会谈，就让它下台，再成立一个愿意会谈的政府。”他号召英国工人运动团结起来。
