Seeing Off a Comrade Going Down to the Countryside, But Missing Him
　　The person is gone, the room is empty, the lamp at the window no longer glows red,
　　The north wind blows at You'anmen, the streetcars rush by;
　　Coming to say farewell, I mistimed his departure, entering the door, his voice and face were already gone,
　　How difficult is it to gather, and now another separation to the east and west!
　　For more than twenty years, we have walked the same path of struggle,
　　For the country and the people, establishing new achievements everywhere;
　　I am moved by your pure and simple heart, as innocent as a child,
　　Obeying orders to go up and down three times, your temples are streaked with frost;
　　Loving a friend as a brother, vowing not to follow the muddy currents!
　　Red like the plum blossoms of the capital, firm as the pine trees of the Yu River;
　　Leaving or staying, what is there to say, the desire to go down is even stronger,
　　Happy countenance at the moment of departure, boarding the train with a cheerful rumble;
　　From this point, the wind and clouds will rise, the sugar mill will be filled with the scent of Guangxi,
　　When will we be able to comfort you again, my vision is blurred with tears.
　　Tonight, the courtyard is wide and spacious, I walk alone among the pine trees on the sand,
　　Looking back again and again, hot tears surge like the spring tide.

### 送别战友下放未遇
俯拾

　　送别战友下放未遇
　　俯拾
　　人去房已空，窗灯不见红，
　　北风右安门，街车自匆匆；
　　来别误行期，入门失音容，
　　相聚何太难，一别又西东！
　　二十余年来，战斗路相同，
　　为国为人民，到处立新功；
　　感你纯朴怀，赤心若儿童，
　　奉命三上下，鬓发染霜风；
　　爱友如爱弟，浊流誓不从！
　　红如京城梅，刚比郁江松；
　　去留何足道，下放意又浓，
　　临行喜行色，登车畅轰隆；
　　此去风云起，糖厂满桂中，
　　何时再慰劳，倾?眼朦胧。
　　今晚宽院阔，只影步沙松，
　　回望再回望，热泪春潮涌。
