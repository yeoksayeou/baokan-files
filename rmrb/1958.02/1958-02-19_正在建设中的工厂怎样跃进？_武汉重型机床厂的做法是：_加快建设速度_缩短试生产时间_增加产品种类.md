How Can Factories Under Construction Leap Forward?
The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant's Approach:
Accelerate Construction Speed, Shorten Trial Production Time, Increase Product Variety
    This Dispatch from Our Newspaper Reporter Zhang Pei: The construction project of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, a large-scale facility with top-notch equipment, is on the verge of completion. Those "giant" machine tools that our country has never been able to produce will soon be continuously output from here to equip other newly built factories. With the completion of this factory, the level of our country's machine industry, which is advancing by leaps and bounds, will reach a new height.
    On a snowy day, I visited this factory, which covers hundreds of thousands of square meters and has eight massive production workshops. From my visit, I felt that three things are worth introducing to everyone.
    One thing is that according to the original plan, this factory was to be built in two phases and would not be fully completed and put into production until the end of 1960. Later, it was decided to combine the two phases into one, completing construction one and a half years ahead of schedule. This bold plan is about to be realized, with full completion expected in the first half of this year and formal production starting in the second half. However, this plan to accelerate construction speed once encountered setbacks. To complete construction one and a half years ahead of schedule would naturally bring a series of difficulties to the capital construction work. Therefore, in 1957, some comrades doubted such a speed and advocated reducing the annual construction plan. Thus, the plan to complete construction one and a half years ahead of schedule was on the verge of failure. Either slow down the construction progress, or give full play to our drive and complete the project as scheduled. Two paths were available for people to choose. With the support and assistance of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee, the factory's Party committee resolutely chose the latter. They took a variety of measures: asking the Municipal Party Committee to help convene meetings of parties A, B, and C (design), to jointly solve various problems in accelerating progress; sending people to Beijing to obtain help from higher authorities; and convening a workers' representative congress to launch a construction upsurge through a rectification upsurge. As a result, the situation was very good, and various plans were overfulfilled, making it very certain that the project would be completed one and a half years ahead of schedule. From this, it can be seen that as long as we truly make efforts, the progress of construction projects can not only be accelerated, but also greatly advanced. Obviously, putting industrial enterprises, especially modern large-scale industrial enterprises, into production a year, half a year, or even a month ahead of schedule is the greatest increase in production and savings. Conversely, delaying the completion time of the project becomes a huge waste.
    Another thing is that this factory will mass-produce nine types of heavy machine tools this year, seven of which are new varieties. For a factory that has just been completed to be able to mass-produce new products, it is natural that thorough production preparation work has been done in advance. General production preparations will not be elaborated on, but two points should be raised. One is that in 1957, this factory decided to trial-produce four products. At that time, the two main processing workshops had not yet been built, and the machines had not been installed. How could they trial-produce? They came up with a solution: choose the smaller of these four types of products and go to old factories such as the Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Plant and the Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, which manufacture similar machine tools, to trial-produce them. The method was to send personnel from this factory to the old factories, and the trial-produced products were included in the production plan. Another point is the factory's internal production preparation, using the empty space in the already built model library to first install several large pieces of equipment to process large parts for heavy machine tools, with small parts supplied by the already built tool workshop, and castings by external factories through cooperation. In this way, when the workshops had not yet been built, they had already practiced for a year inside and out, producing three heavy machine tools, thereby becoming familiar with the drawings, mastering the processing technology, and improving management and technical levels. The result is that the trial production time after the factory is completed is greatly shortened. The fact that this is possible to do this year with the mass production of seven new types of heavy machine tools is much more advantageous than some newly built factories which have to go through a considerable period of trial production before they can formally produce and exert economic effectiveness. It is entirely a good thing to be able to quickly meet the country's needs for heavy machine tools and create wealth for the country in advance.
    The third thing is to increase the variety of products. According to the original regulations, this factory was only to produce seventeen specifications of five types of heavy machine tools. During the construction process, they sent people to investigate various parties and found that the originally stipulated product types could not meet the needs of construction, and therefore did not meet the country's requirement that mechanical equipment should be more than 90% self-sufficient within the second five-year plan. Therefore, they re-formulated the production outline, increasing the product specifications to sixty or seventy types. At the same time, they also made corresponding changes to the design of the processing workshops in a timely manner.
    In summary, the above three things are all noteworthy issues in industrial construction. In the upsurge of socialist construction, we should strive to accelerate construction speed, shorten trial production time, and increase the variety of products as much as possible.

    正在建设中的工厂怎样跃进？
    武汉重型机床厂的做法是：
    加快建设速度　缩短试生产时间　增加产品种类
    本报讯　记者张沛报道：规模巨大、具有头等装备的武汉重型机床厂的建设工程，已经处在竣工的前夕了。我国历史上从来不能生产的那些机床中的“巨人”，即将从这里源源输出装备其它的新建工厂。由于这个工厂的建成，大步前进的我国机器工业的水平又将达到一个新的高度。
    一个飘雪的日子，记者访问了这个占地数十万平方公尺、有八个庞大的生产厂房的工厂。从访问中我觉得有三件事值得向大家介绍。
    一件事是这个厂按照原来的计划，分两期建设，要到1960年底才能全部建成生产。以后决定两期工程并为一期，提前一年半建成。这个果敢的计划即将实现，今年上半年可全部竣工，下半年正式投入生产。但是这个加快建设速度的计划，也曾一度遇到波折。要提前一年半竣工，当然会给基建工作带来一连串的困难，因此，1957年有一部分同志对这样的速度发生怀疑，主张削减年度建设计划。这样，提前一年半竣工的计划就处在失败的边缘。或者是放慢建设进度，或者发挥干劲如期完工。两条路任人们选择。工厂党委在武汉市委的支持和协助下，坚决选择了后者。他们采取了多种措施：请市委帮助召开甲、乙、丙（设计）方会议，共同解决加快进度中的各种问题；派人到北京取得上级的帮助；召开职工代表大会，通过整改高潮掀起建设高潮。结果情况很好，各项计划都超额完成，提前一年半完工，变成很有把握的事了。由此可见，只要真正经过努力，建设工程的进度不仅是可以加快的，而且可以大大提前。很显然，工业企业特别是现代化的大工业企业的建设，提前一年、半年甚至一个月投入生产，是最大的增产节约。相反，拖延工程的竣工时间就变成一种巨大的浪费了。
    再一件事是这个工厂今年下半年就要成批生产九种重型机床，其中有七种是新品种。工厂刚刚竣工就能成批生产新品种的产品，自然是事先已经做好了周密的生产准备工作。一般的生产准备不去细述，有两点应当提出。一是在1957年，这个厂就确定了试制四种产品。那时两个主要的加工厂房尚未盖好，机器也没有安好，怎么试制呢？他们想出了办法：选择这四种产品中较小的一类，到制造同类型机床的济南第二机床厂、齐齐哈尔第一机床厂等老厂去试制。方法是由本厂派出人马到老厂去，试制的产品纳入生产计划。另一点是厂内生产准备，利用已建好的模型库的空场地，先安装好几台大型设备加工重型机床的大零件，小零件由已建好的工具车间供给，铸件由外厂协作。这样，在厂房尚未盖好时，他们已里里外外练了一年兵，制成了三台重型机床，由此熟悉了图纸、掌握了加工的工艺过程、提高了管理和技术水平。结果是大大缩短了工厂建成后的试生产时间。正因为有了这个基础，今年下半年才可能成批生产七种新品种的重型机床。这一点比起一些新建工厂要经过相当长时间的试生产，才能正式生产发挥经济效能，当然有利得多。既能迅速满足国家对重型机床的需要，又能提前为国家创造财富，完全是一件好事。
    第三件事是增加产品的种类。这个工厂按原来规定只生产五种类型的十七种规格的重机床。在建设过程中他们派人到各方调查，发现原来规定的产品种类，不能满足建设的需要，因而也就不符合国家提出的在第二个五年计划内机械装备应自给90％以上的要求。因此他们就重新制订生产大纲，把产品的规格增加至六七十种。同时还及时把加工厂房的设计作了相应的改变。
    综观上述三件事，都是工业建设中一些值得注意的问题，在社会主义建设的高潮中我们更应当力求加快建设速度、缩短试生产时间和尽可能地增加产品的种类。
