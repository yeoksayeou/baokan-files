Huaiyang County Implements the Policy of "Building and Using Simultaneously"
    Mobilizing the Masses to Rush Production of Water Lifting Tools

    (Reported by our newspaper) In conjunction with the high tide of farmland water conservancy construction, Huaiyang County, Henan Province, is vigorously rushing to produce water lifting tools, giving full play to the capacity of existing water conservancy equipment, and making preparations for spring irrigation of wheat.

    Since the beginning of winter, Huaiyang County has launched a non-stop, relentless water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation campaign. Under the slogan of "Achieving water conservancy within one year and guaranteeing a yield of 500 jin per mu," after two months of arduous struggle, remarkable achievements have been made. The task of flood drainage has been completed for 660,000 mu, and the irrigated area has been expanded by 900,000 mu. However, due to the fact that Huaiyang has suffered from floods over the years, coupled with the lack of an irrigation foundation, there has been a phenomenon of emphasizing flood drainage and neglecting irrigation, and emphasizing quantity and neglecting quality in the water conservancy construction movement. Looking at the field projects, flood drainage projects are better, while irrigation projects are relatively poor. According to inspections, only 131 mu of the 1,870 mu of wheat field ridges in Liji Township can be irrigated; 629 mu need to be repaired before they can be irrigated; and 1,113.5 mu need to be reworked. Liu Wentong, the production team leader of the Zhuifeng Cooperative in the township, said: "Flood drainage can be done universally, but irrigation can only be done selectively; if all fields are turned into irrigated fields, where will we get so many water lifting tools? To fully realize water conservancy, unless the government lends us water carts." After discovering these problems, the county party committee immediately checked and calculated the existing water lifting tools in the county: 4,576 waterwheels, each irrigating 30 mu, totaling 137,280 mu; 10 gas engines, each irrigating 300 mu, totaling 3,000 mu; 8,000 windlasses, each irrigating 15 mu, totaling 120,000 mu; 14,000 carrying poles and tipping buckets, each irrigating 10 mu, totaling 140,000 mu, for a total of 400,280 mu that can be irrigated, accounting for 22% of the county's total cultivated land area of 1,840,000 mu. There are still 78% of the cultivated land that lack water lifting tools. This is far from the requirement of realizing water conservancy this year and turning all fields into irrigated fields. Therefore, the county party committee, according to the water conservancy construction policy of "mainly relying on the cooperatives" and the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in running water conservancy, proposed the call to "build and use simultaneously," relying on the masses, overcoming difficulties, starting early, and solving the problem of water lifting tools, requiring that there be tools for every well and pond, and that all fields be irrigated in rotation every three to five days. At the same time, according to this requirement, a preliminary plan was formulated: in addition to purchasing pumps and 1,064 waterwheels, which can irrigate a total of 295,000 mu, it is planned to mobilize the masses to manufacture 10,000 wind-powered waterwheels (each irrigating 60 mu), 10,000 foot-operated waterwheels (each irrigating 40 mu), and old-style windlasses, etc., to achieve comprehensive irrigation. After this plan was implemented through a series of meetings such as the county's Water Conservancy Construction Activist Representatives Meeting (including the main responsible cadres of townships and cooperatives), the enthusiasm of the broad masses for creating water lifting tools was mobilized by using the methods of investigation, calculation, and debate. A "those who have money contribute money, those who have ideas contribute ideas" movement was launched throughout the county, relying on the masses, giving play to the wisdom of the masses, thinking of ways, offering suggestions, and manufacturing water lifting tools. Under the slogan of "relying on the masses and boldly creating," Sheng Guangcai (member of the county party committee), the procurator of the county procuratorate, personally visited the old carpenter workers Sun Yiming and Peng Shukai in Nihe Township with Wei Jingquan, the secretary of the township party committee. After seven days of research, they trial-produced a wooden hand-cranked pond cart. Eight carpenters from the Huaifeng Cooperative in Zhuji Township imitated a wooden foot-operated water dragon. These tools have been tested and evaluated, and the results are good. The common features are: small investment (25 to 40 yuan per unit); high water output rate (each unit can irrigate 50 to 60 mu, equivalent to two Liberation-style waterwheels); simple manufacturing (generally carpenters can learn it at a glance); and convenient use. The county party committee believes that relying on the masses is the fundamental solution to the problem of water lifting tools, which meets the requirements of "more, faster, better, and more economical." For this reason, the county party committee decided to vigorously promote the experience of the masses in Zhuji and Nihe townships in creating water lifting tools throughout the county, and required strengthening leadership over this work. The county, with Deputy County Head Li Zhongchen in charge, absorbed relevant departments such as the county supply and marketing cooperative to form a material supply group for manufacturing water lifting tools, and each township also designated special personnel to be responsible under the unified leadership of the water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation organization.

    At present, various localities are using forms such as master-apprentice teaching, learning by doing, visiting and practicing, and organizing training classes, and have trained 297 technicians, who are trial-producing various types of water lifting tools. In order to solve the problem of materials for manufacturing water lifting tools, a fundraising movement for materials has been launched. As of February 13, the county has invested more than 840,000 yuan, and physical objects such as wood are worth more than 150,000 yuan. In addition to purchasing 11 gas engines and 1,051 waterwheels, 954 various water lifting tools (including wind-powered waterwheels, foot-operated waterwheels, hand-cranked waterwheels, windlasses, carrying poles, etc.) have been manufactured. The four technicians for manufacturing water lifting tools invited by the county party committee from Jiangsu Province have made a wind-powered waterwheel and a foot-operated waterwheel, and have conducted tests in the newly dug pits and ponds of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Balimiao Township. Now, responsible cadres of each township are being organized in batches to lead carpenters and technicians to visit and learn, and to manufacture water lifting tools in large quantities.

### 淮阳县贯彻“边建设，边使用”的方针  发动群众赶制提水工具

    淮阳县贯彻“边建设，边使用”的方针
    发动群众赶制提水工具
    本报讯　河南省淮阳县在农田水利建设高潮的同时，大力赶制提水工具，充分发挥现有水利设备能力，为春灌小麦作好准备。
    入冬以来，淮阳县开展了日夜不停、风雪不止的水利积肥运动，在“一年实现水利化、保证亩产五百斤”的口号下，经过两个月来的艰苦奋战，已取得辉煌成绩，除涝任务已完成六十六万亩，扩大灌溉面积九十万亩。但由于淮阳地区历年遭受水灾，加之没有灌溉基础，因而在水利建设运动中，出现了重除涝、轻灌溉，重数量、轻质量的现象。从田间工程看，除涝工程较好，灌溉工程较差。据检查，李集乡一千八百七十多亩麦地畦田，能灌溉的只有一百三十一亩；需要修整才能灌溉的六百二十九亩；需要返工的一千一百一十三亩半。该乡追风社生产队长刘文同说：“除涝可以普遍搞，灌溉只能重点搞；要是都变成水浇田，哪有那么多的提水工具呢？要全部实现水利化，除非政府贷水车。”县委发现这些问题后，随即查算了全县现有提水工具：水车四千五百七十六部，每部浇三十亩地，计浇十三万七千二百八十亩；煤气机十部，每部浇地三百亩，计浇地三千亩；辘轳八千个，每个浇地十五亩，计浇地十二万亩；挑杆、倒罐一万四千个，每个浇地十亩，计浇十四万亩，共计可浇地四十万零二百八十亩，占全县耕地面积一百八十四万亩的22％，尚有78％的耕地没有提水工具。这与今年实现水利化、全部变成水浇地的要求相距很远。因此，县委根据
  “以社办为主”的水利建设方针和
  “又多、又快、又好、又省”的勤俭办水利的原则，提出了“边建设、边使用”，依靠群众，克服困难，及早动手，解决提水工具的号召，要求井井、塘塘有工具，三至五天全部轮浇一遍。同时，按照这个要求，并制订了初步规划：除购买抽水机和水车一千零六十四部，共可浇地二十九万五千亩外，计划发动群众制造风力水车一万部（每部可浇六十亩地）、脚踏水车一万部（每部可浇地四十亩），以及旧式辘轳等，达到全面灌溉。这个规划通过县水利建设积极分子代表会（包括乡、社主要负责干部参加）等一系列的会议贯彻后，利用查、算、辩论的方法，调动了广大群众创造提水工具的积极性，在全县范围内开展了一个“有钱出钱、有计献计”运动，依靠群众，发挥群众智慧，想办法，出主意，制造提水工具。在“依靠群众，大胆创造”的口号下，县检察院检察长盛广才（县委委员），在泥河乡和乡党委书记位景全同志亲自访问了老木匠工人孙益明、彭树凯等，经过七天的钻研，试制了木制手摇塘车。朱集乡淮锋社八个木工仿造了木制脚踏水龙。这些工具经过试验鉴定，效果良好，共同的特点是：投资小（每部二十五至四十元）；出水率大（每部可浇地五十至六十亩，顶两部解放式水车）；制造简单（一般木工一看就会）；使用方便等。县委认为：依靠群众是解决提水工具的根本办法，符合“多、快、好、省”的要求。为此，县委确定在全县范围内大力推广朱集、泥河两乡群众创造提水工具的经验，并要求加强对这一工作的领导。县以副县长李钟晨同志为主，吸收县供销社等有关部门，组成制造提水工具物资供应组，各乡也在水利积肥机构的统一领导下，指定专人负责。
    目前各地运用以师带徒、边作边学、参观实习、组织训练班等形式，已训练技术员二百九十七人，正在试制各式各样的提水工具。为了解决制造提水工具的物料问题，并开展了集资对料运动，截至2月13日，全县已投资八十四万多元，木料等实物折款十五万多元，除购买煤气机十一部、水车一千零五十一部外，已制造各种提水工具（包括风力水车、脚踏水车、手摇水车、辘轳、挑杆等）九百五十四件。县委从江苏省请来的四名制造提水工具技术员，已制好了一部风力水车、一部脚踏水车，并在八里庙乡红光农业社新打的坑塘里进行了试验。现在正分批组织各乡负责干部，带领木工、技术员参观学习，大量制造提水工具。
