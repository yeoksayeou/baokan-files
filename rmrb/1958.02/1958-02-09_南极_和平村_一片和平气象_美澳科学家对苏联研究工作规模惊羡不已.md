　　Antarctic "Peace Village" radiates an atmosphere of peace;
    American and Australian scientists admire the scale of Soviet research work
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Antarctica: The main Soviet scientific base in Antarctica, "Peace Village," recently received scientists from the United States and Australia. The completeness of the base's equipment impressed and amazed scientists from both countries.

　　In late January, the American research vessel "Burton Island" visited "Peace Village." More than one hundred staff members of the American Antarctic Expedition visited the science exhibition hall and learned about the research work of Soviet scientists and the station. The peaceful atmosphere and the enormous scale of the work left a deep impression on them. They did not see any soldiers here; all the staff were civilians. The station has a total of one hundred and seventy staff members, making it the largest research station in Antarctica, while the American McMurdo Station has only a little over one hundred personnel.

　　On January 31, a group of Australian Antarctic Expedition personnel, led by Phillip Law, visited "Peace Village" aboard the research vessel "Thala Dan." Phillip Law was visiting "Peace Village" for the second time (the first time was shortly after the Soviet expedition landed in January 1956). White, an Australian journalist who accompanied the group, said that the Soviet "Peace Village" base has excellent equipment and is a modern research base. The base amazed the Australian scientists.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 8th dispatch from The Hague: Antarctic scientists and experts from twelve countries have suggested that after the end of the International Geophysical Year in late 1958, a new five-year plan for further scientific research in the Antarctic region should be implemented.

　　This suggestion was adopted by the members of the Special Committee on Antarctic Research at a meeting held in The Hague from February 3rd to 5th.

　　The committee members believe that in addition to the existing twenty-five scientific stations on the Antarctic continent and nearby islands, ten new scientific stations must be added to effectively study geology, oceanography, biology, and the soil structure of the Antarctic continent. At the same time, they emphasized the importance of expanding seismic observations for the benefit of the Pacific regions that are frequently affected by earthquakes.

　　French Professor Laclavère, who was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Special Committee, said at a press conference that these suggestions will be forwarded to governments and academies of sciences of various countries. The next meeting of the Special Committee will be held in Moscow in August of this year. (Attached photo)

　　南极“和平村”一片和平气象
    美澳科学家对苏联研究工作规模惊羡不已
    新华社7日讯　南极消息：苏联在南极的主要科学基地“和平村”，最近分别接待了美国和澳大利亚科学家。基地上设备的齐全，引起了这两个国家的科学家的赞叹和羡慕。
    1月下旬，美国考察船“伯顿艾兰号”访问了“和平村”。一百多位美国南极考察队的工作人员参观了科学陈列室，并了解了苏联科学家和考察站的研究工作。这里的和平气氛和工作规模的巨大给他们留下了深刻的印象。他们在这里没有看到军人，这里的工作人员全是平民。这个站的工作人员一共有一百七十人，它是南极最大的考察站。而美国的麦克穆多基地的人员只有一百多一点。
    1月31日，澳大利亚以菲利浦·劳为首的一批南极考察队人员乘坐“塔拉丹号”考察船访问了“和平村”。菲利浦·劳是第二次来“和平村”访问（第一次是在1956年1月苏联考察队登陆以后不久来的）。随同前来的澳大利亚记者怀特在谈观感时说，苏联“和平村”基地拥有极优良的装备，是现代化的考察基地。这个基地使澳大利亚科学家惊羡不已。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社海牙讯：十二国的南极科学家和专家建议在1958年年底国际地球物理年结束以后，开始实行进一步在南极地区进行科学研究的新的五年计划。
    这项建议已经由南极地带研究专门委员会委员于2月3日到5日在海牙举行的会议上通过。
    委员会委员认为，除了南极大陆和附近岛屿上的原有的二十五个科学站以外，必须再增建十个新的科学站，以便有效地研究地质学、海洋学、生物学和南极大陆的土壤构造。同时他们强调指出了为了那些经常遭到地震灾害的太平洋地区的利益而扩大地震观测的重要性。
    当选为专门委员会执行委员会主席的法国教授拉卡维尔在记者招待会上说，这些建议将转送各国政府和科学院。专门委员会下次会议将在本年8月在莫斯科召开。（附图片）
