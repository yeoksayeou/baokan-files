Xinhua News Agency, London, February 26th: The British "News Chronicle" published the results of a Gallup poll today, showing that the Conservative and Labour parties continue to lose popular support.

The newspaper posed the following question to those participating in the survey: "If a general election were held tomorrow, who would you vote for?" The percentage of respondents saying they would vote for the Conservative Party fell from 33% last month to 29%; while the percentage saying they would vote for the Labour Party also fell from 39% last month to 36%.

The newspaper pointed out in its editorial that this shows "an increasing number of people are disgusted by being fooled by British politics under the current party system."

    违背民意　丧失民心
    英国两大党身价大跌
    新华社伦敦26日电英国“新闻纪事报”今天发表盖洛普民意测验的结果表明：保守党和工党继续丧失民心。
    这家报纸向参加测验的人提出这样一个问题：“如果明天举行大选，你投谁的票？”回答说要投保守党的票的，从上月的33％下降为29％；而回答说要投工党的票的也从上月的39％下降到36％。
    报纸在社论里指出，这表明“有越来越多的人讨厌受目前政党制度下英国政治的愚弄”。
