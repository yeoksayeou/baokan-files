Mobilize the Masses to Find Solutions
    Lin Mu
    The news from Huaiyang County, Henan Province, that they are starting early to manufacture water-lifting tools, raises a very important question for the current stage nationwide: The high tide of farmland water conservancy construction since winter has increased China's irrigated area at an unprecedented rate. As of the 20th of this month, the national irrigated area has increased by more than 160 million mu. Are these newly added paddy fields and irrigated land provided with the large number of water-lifting tools they need? All localities must immediately consider this issue and put it on the current agenda, just like Huaiyang County. Otherwise, these water conservancy projects will hardly play a role in the 1958 production increase campaign.
    Solving the problem of a large number of water-lifting tools in a very short period of time seems like a difficult task. In Huaiyang County, 78% of the cultivated land lacks water-lifting tools, and the situation in other regions cannot be much better. However, as can be seen from the report of Huaiyang County, this difficulty can be overcome. The key is still to rely on the masses and deeply mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Some ordinary carpenters in Huaiyang County can create cheap, practical, efficient, and simple-to-manufacture pedal water dragons and hand-cranked pond carts in a few days. Why can't carpenters and blacksmiths in other regions create even better tools?
    We propose that all localities continue to adopt the method of organizing visits at any time, as in the large-scale water conservancy campaign. Quickly organize some people to visit Huaiyang County and other places that have created simple water-lifting tools to learn from their creations and quickly promote manufacturing; and call on and organize the masses in their own regions to come up with ideas to create more economical, time-saving, and efficient tools. The people are the ocean of wisdom. As long as we believe in the creativity of the masses and strive to encourage and develop this creativity, we will be able to solve all new difficult problems. The most harmful tendency is to not use your own brain, not think of ways, and only want to reach out to the higher-ups for waterwheels and machines. It must be understood that our country is still very poor and cannot immediately meet such a large need. The best way is to mobilize the masses to think of solutions together.

    发动群众想办法
    林木
    河南省淮阳县及早动手赶制提水工具的消息，向全国提出了一个目前阶段十分重要的问题：冬季以来各地兴修农田水利的高潮，使我国灌溉面积以史无前例的速度大量增加了。到本月20日为止，全国灌溉面积已增加一亿六千多万亩。这些新增加的水田和水浇地需要大量的提水工具是不是有了着落呢？各地都必须马上考虑这一问题，像淮阳县一样把这个问题提到当前议程上来。不然，这些水利工程就很难在1958年的增产运动中发挥作用。
    在很短的期间解决大量提水工具的问题，看来实在不是一件容易的事。淮阳县缺乏提水工具的耕地占到78％，别的地区也不可能很少。但是，从淮阳县的报道中可以看出，这个困难是能够克服的。问题的关键，仍然是依靠群众，深入地发动群众的积极性和创造性。淮阳县一些普普通通的木工可以在数日内创制出价廉、适用、效率高而又简单易制的脚踏水龙和手摇塘车，别的地区的木工铁工为什么不能创造出更好的工具？
    我们提议各地仍然采取水利大进军中随时组织参观的办法，赶快组织一些人到淮阳县和其他创造了简便提水工具的地方去参观，学习他们的创造，迅速推广制造；并且号召和组织自己地区的群众都来想办法，创造更省钱、更省时间和更有效率的工具。人民群众是智慧的海洋，只要我们相信群众的创造力，并且努力去鼓励和发挥这种创造力，我们就能够解决一切新的困难问题。最有害的倾向，就是自己不动脑筋，不想办法，光想向上面伸手要水车，要机器。要知道，我们国家目前还很穷，决不可能马上满足这么大的需要。最好的办法，就是发动群众大家想办法。
