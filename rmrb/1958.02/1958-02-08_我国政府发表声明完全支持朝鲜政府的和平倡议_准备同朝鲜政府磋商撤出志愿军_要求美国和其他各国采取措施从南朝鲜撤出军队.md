Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement:

　　On February 5, 1958, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the peaceful reunification of Korea, in which it proposed: all foreign troops should simultaneously withdraw from North and South Korea; free elections should be held throughout Korea under the supervision of a neutral nations supervisory commission after all foreign troops have withdrawn from Korea; North and South Korea should consult on an equal footing to discuss economic and cultural exchanges between the North and South and elections throughout Korea; and North and South Korea should each reduce their armies to a minimum in the near future. This is another major effort by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. These proposals not only fully conform to the deep desire of all Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, but will also open up new and realistic ways to ease tensions in the Far East. The Chinese government fully agrees with and fully supports this major peace initiative of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

　　Based on the fundamental position that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves, the Chinese government and the Chinese people have always opposed foreign interference in Korean affairs and resolutely advocated the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. At the very beginning of the Korean War, the Chinese government and the Chinese people advocated that the US invading forces should immediately withdraw from Korea. It was only when the warnings of the Chinese government and the Chinese people were rejected by the United States, and when the US troops not only invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea but also occupied China's Taiwan and seriously threatened China's security, that the Chinese people formed the Volunteer Army to go to Korea and fight together with the Korean people against US aggression. During the Korean armistice negotiations and after the armistice was achieved, the Chinese government and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have constantly suggested that all foreign troops should simultaneously withdraw from North and South Korea, and believe that this is the primary condition for holding free elections throughout Korea and realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the US side has not only consistently rejected this reasonable proposal from the Korean and Chinese sides, but has also repeatedly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, and has recently even openly shipped in atomic weapons, further turning South Korea into a US colony and atomic base. As the statement of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea pointed out, the continued occupation of South Korea by US troops is the fundamental reason why the peaceful reunification of Korea has been delayed and the peace of Korea is even more threatened.

　　The Chinese people have always been concerned about the peace of Korea. The Chinese government has never stinted its efforts to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Now that the peace aspirations of the people of Asian and countries around the world are unprecedentedly high, and there is a greater possibility of peacefully resolving major international issues, the Chinese government believes that the situation in Korea should not be allowed to continue to deteriorate. In order to break the deadlock on the Korean issue, promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and ease tensions in the Far East, the Chinese government believes that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea on a regular basis; the Chinese government is also prepared to consult with the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the issue of the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army from Korea. The Chinese government requests the US government and the governments of other countries participating in the United Nations forces to take similar measures to withdraw US troops and all other foreign troops from South Korea. The Chinese government hopes that all countries concerned about peace in the Far East and the world will take active steps to promote the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, so as to create favorable conditions for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the maintenance of peace in the Far East and the world.

　　我国政府发表声明完全支持朝鲜政府的和平倡议
    准备同朝鲜政府磋商撤出志愿军
    要求美国和其他各国采取措施从南朝鲜撤出军队
    新华社7日讯中华人民共和国政府声明
    一九五八年二月五日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府就朝鲜的和平统一问题发表了声明，声明中建议：一切外国军队同时撤出南北朝鲜；在外国军队全部撤出朝鲜后的一定时期内，在中立国机构监督下举行全朝鲜的自由选举；南北朝鲜在对等的基础上进行协商，讨论南北之间的经济、文化交流和全朝鲜选举等问题；南北朝鲜在最近期间各自将军队缩减到最低限度。这是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为和平解决朝鲜问题所作的又一次重大努力。这些建议不仅完全符合全朝鲜人民对于和平统一祖国的深切愿望，而且也将为和缓远东紧张局势开辟新的现实的途径。中国政府完全赞同并且全力支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府这一重大的和平倡议。
    中国政府和中国人民本着朝鲜问题应该由朝鲜人民自己解决的基本立场，一贯反对对于朝鲜事务的外来干涉，坚决主张一切外国军队撤出朝鲜。在朝鲜战争刚一开始的时候，中国政府和中国人民就主张美国的侵略军队应该立即撤出朝鲜。只是在中国政府和中国人民的警告遭到美国的拒绝、美国军队不仅侵略了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、并且同时侵占了中国的台湾和严重地威胁中国安全的时候，中国人民才组成志愿军前往朝鲜和朝鲜人民一道共同反抗美国的侵略。在朝鲜停战谈判过程中和停战实现后，中国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府又不断地建议一切外国军队同时撤出南北朝鲜，并且认为这是在全朝鲜举行自由选举、实现朝鲜和平统一的首要条件。但是，美国方面不仅始终拒绝朝中方面的这一合理建议，而且还一再破坏朝鲜停战协定，最近甚至公然运进原子武器，把南朝鲜进一步变成美国的殖民地和原子基地。诚如朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府声明所指出的，美国军队对南朝鲜的继续侵占是朝鲜的和平统一迟迟不能实现、朝鲜的和平更加受到威胁的基本原因。
    中国人民一向关心朝鲜的和平。中国政府为促进朝鲜问题的和平解决从不吝惜自己的力量。现在当着亚洲和世界各国人民的和平愿望空前高涨、和平解决国际间的重大问题有了更大可能的时候，中国政府认为不应该听任朝鲜局势继续恶化。为了打开在朝鲜问题上的僵局，并且推动朝鲜问题的和平解决和和缓远东的紧张局势，中国政府认为，一切外国军队，应该定期撤出朝鲜；中国政府并且准备就中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤出的问题同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府进行磋商。中国政府要求美国政府和参加联合国军的其他各国政府同样采取措施，从南朝鲜撤出美国军队和其他一切外国军队。中国政府希望一切关心远东和世界和平的国家采取积极的步骤，促使一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，为和平解决朝鲜问题和维护远东和世界的和平创造有利的条件。
