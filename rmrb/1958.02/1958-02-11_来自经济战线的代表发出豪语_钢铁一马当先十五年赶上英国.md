Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Representatives from the economic front made bold statements. Steel Takes the Lead, Catching Up with Britain in Fifteen Years

    The Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress continued its plenary discussion this morning. Many representatives from the industrial front stated in their speeches today that achieving the great task proposed by the Party Central Committee of catching up with or surpassing Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little more is a serious test and exercise for the people of our country, and they have sufficient confidence to complete this glorious and arduous task.
    Sun Dehe, a black metallurgical worker and engineer, said that the great call of the Party Central Committee has greatly encouraged all black metallurgical workers. We have strong confidence in completing our task excellently and will never bow to difficulties. He said that the annual growth rate of steel in the past five years has been 31%. If the annual growth rate remains at 20% in the future, China's steel production can reach the level of 40 million tons by approximately 1969 to 1970. He said that the objective conditions are unprecedentedly favorable, and what remains is our subjective efforts, and it is entirely possible to complete such a glorious task.
    Liu Jingfan, Deputy Minister of Geology, pointed out in a written statement that China's mineral resources are much richer than those of Britain. From the perspective of mineral resource conditions, it is entirely possible for the people of our country to realize this great call of the Party Central Committee. Liu Jingfan cited a large number of inspiring facts to illustrate that China is a country with very rich mineral resources. The proven reserves of minerals such as iron, coal, manganese, copper, lead, tungsten, aluminum, tin, and molybdenum have all jumped to the forefront in the world.
    Liu Jiuxue, a model industrial worker from the Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Henan, said in a written statement that the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, which was a "dilapidated mess" before liberation, has now been restored to its youth. Over the past five years, the workers have mined 9.9 million tons of coal, and the funds accumulated for the country are enough to build ten pairs of modern mines with an annual output of 300,000 tons or more. In the next five years, the output of raw coal from the Jiaozuo Coal Mine will increase from 2.4 million tons last year to an annual output of 6 million tons.
    Industrial labor models Li Yong, Li Shusen, and Guo Shude said in a joint speech that after the Party Central Committee put forward this great call, railway workers all felt "clear-headed" and "full of energy." Railway workers have all seen this situation: the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country will inevitably bring heavy transportation tasks to the railway department; we must tap potential and transport more goods and passengers to all parts of the country, and use a great leap forward in transportation to meet the great leap forward in industry and agriculture.
    Wang Xingyao, Hu Ziying, Hu Juewen, Guo Dihuo, Sheng Pihua, Tang Di Yin, Rong Yiren, Liu Jingji, and Wei Ru, nine representatives of Shanghai industrialists and businessmen, made a joint statement. They said that they originally thought they were the backbone of the industrial and commercial circles and had been reformed almost completely. After the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, they discovered that they were still basically standing on the capitalist position and needed to undergo thorough transformation in the future. They represented Shanghai industrialists and businessmen in proposing the direction of their efforts in politics, work, and life, and guaranteed that they would be transformed into self-reliant laborers within five years.
    Writer Lao She gave a vivid speech at the meeting today, saying that in the upsurge of construction, writers should also strive for a climax in literary creation. In three to five years, writers will surely produce many decent works.
    Lao She said that after the rectification work and the transfer of cadres to lower levels, the Writers Association is no longer like a yamen (bureaucracy). In his speech, he particularly ridiculed the disgusting face of foreign stereotypes in creation, saying that once writers' ideological transformation has made progress, the writing style will inevitably change accordingly, and foreign stereotypes will no longer be able to stand their ground. Lao She said that there is still some separation between works and the people, one of the reasons being that the writing style is at fault. He expressed his earnest hope that the writing style will change so that the writer's heart can touch the people's hearts through the writer's writing style.
    Also speaking or making written statements at today's morning meeting were Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Zhu Xuefan, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, Wu Xian, Vice Governor of Zhejiang Province, Wu Yunfu, Vice Minister of Health, Chen Qiyuan, Vice Minister of Internal Affairs, Liu Qingyang and Ni Feijun, Deputy Secretaries-General of the Red Cross Society of China, Patikhan Sugurbayev, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Lin Wenbiao, Chief Engineer of the Rubber Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, Hou Zhenya, member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Jinxi, professor at Beijing Normal University, Han Wangchen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, historian Lu Zhenyu, Jia Xinqi, Vice Governor of Henan Province, Shen Ce, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Gao Zhenwu, Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Education, Yao Yilin, Vice Minister of Commerce, Liu Mingbang, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Zukang, Vice Mayor of Shanghai, Tang Di Yin, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Pen Industry Company, Shi Bangzhi, Governor of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province, Wu Hongbin, Mayor of Lanzhou, Feng Depei, Director of the Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Sun Xiaocun, President of Beijing Agricultural University, Shen Qiyi, Dean of Academic Affairs of Beijing Agricultural University, Lin Qiaozhi, professor at Peking Union Medical College, Zhu Futang, Director of Beijing Children's Hospital, Peng Yangqin, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Electric Power Bureau, Fu Jingwen, model industrial worker, and other representatives. A total of forty-five people spoke this morning.
    The executive chairmen of this morning's meeting were: Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Liu Lantao, Shuai Mengqi, Zhao Maochen, Chen Shaokuan, Liu Wenhui, Chen Wangdao, Dao Jingban, and Xiao Longyou.

    来自经济战线的代表发出豪语
    钢铁一马当先十五年赶上英国
    据新华社10日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议今天上午继续进行大会讨论。来自工业战线上的许多代表在今天的发言中表示，实现党中央提出的在十五年或更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的伟大任务，是对我国人民的一次严重考验和锻炼，他们有足够的信心来完成这个光荣和艰巨的任务。
    黑色冶金工作者、工程师孙德和代表说，党中央提出的伟大号召，给全国黑色冶金工作者以极大的鼓舞。我们有坚强的信心来出色地完成我们的任务，绝不会向困难低头。他说，过去五年来钢每年增长速度是31％，如果今后每年增长速度保持在20％，大致在1969年至1970年，我国钢产量就可以达到四千万吨的水平。他说，客观条件是空前有利的，剩下的就是我们主观的努力，完成这样一个光荣的任务是完全可能的。
    地质部副部长刘景范代表在书面发言中指出，我国矿产资源要比英国丰富得多，从矿产资源条件上看，我国人民实现党中央这个伟大的号召是完全能够做到的。刘景范列举大量振奋人心的事实，说明我国是一个矿产资源十分丰富的国家，像铁、煤、锰、铜、铅、钨、铝、锡、钼等矿产，所探明的储量都已跃居到世界前几位。
    来自河南焦作煤矿的工业劳动模范刘九学代表在书面发言中说，解放前是一个“老破烂摊”的焦作煤矿，现在已恢复了它的青春，职工们五年来挖出了九百九十多万吨煤，为国家积累的资金足够建设十对年产三十万吨以上的现代化矿井。在今后五年内，焦作煤矿的原煤产量将由去年的二百四十万吨，提高到年产六百万吨。
    工业劳动模范李永、李树森、郭树德在联合发言中说，党中央提出这个伟大号召以后，铁路职工们个个都觉得“心明眼亮”，“浑身是劲”。铁路职工们都看到这种形势：全国工农业生产的大跃进，必然给铁路部门带来繁重的运输任务；我们要挖掘潜力，把更多的货物和旅客运往全国各地，以运输的大跃进来迎接工农业的大跃进。
    上海工商业者王性尧、胡子婴、胡厥文、郭棣活、盛丕华、汤蒂因、荣毅仁、刘靖基、魏如等九位代表作了联合发言，他们说，他们几个人，原先自以为是工商界中的骨干，改造得已经差不多了；经过整风反右派斗争，发现原来自己基本上还是站在资本主义立场，今后还需要进行脱胎换骨的改造。他们代表上海工商业者提出了在政治上、工作上、生活上努力的方向，保证要在五年内改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
    作家老舍今天在会上作了一篇生动的发言，他说，在建设的高潮中，作家也要争取文艺创作来个高潮，在三年五载之后，作家必能产生不少像样的作品。
    老舍说，经过了整改工作和下放干部，作家协会不再像衙门了。他在发言中特别嘲笑了创作上洋八股的可憎面目，他说，作家们的思想改造一有了进展，文风也必然随之一变，洋八股要站不住脚了。老舍说，作品与人民之间还有些隔阂，原因之一就是文风在作怪。他表示切盼文风转变，能够通过作家的文字风格，使作家的心碰到人民的心。
    在今天上午的大会上发言或作书面发言的，还有中国民主促进会主席马叙伦，邮电部长朱学范，浙江省副省长吴宪，卫生部副部长伍云甫，内务部副部长陈其瑗，中国红十字会总会副秘书长刘清扬、倪斐君，新疆维吾尔自治区副主席帕提汉·苏古尔巴也夫，轻工业部橡胶工业管理局总工程师林文彪，中共福建省委员会委员侯振亚，北京师范大学教授黎锦熙，全国工商联副主任委员韩望尘，历史学家吕振羽，河南省副省长贾心齐，浙江省工会主席沈策，河南省教育厅长高镇五，商业部副部长姚依林，中共河南省委监察委员会书记刘名榜，上海市副市长赵祖康，上海制笔工业公司副经理汤蒂因，湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州州长石邦智，兰州市市长吴鸿宾，中国科学院生理生化研究所所长冯德培，北京农业大学校长孙晓村，北京农业大学教务长沈其益，中国协和医学院教授林巧稚，北京儿童医院院长诸福棠，武汉市电业局副局长彭仰钦，工业劳动模范傅景文等代表。今天上午发言的共有四十五人。
