Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 16th: The Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) are enthusiastically launching "China-Korea Friendship Month" activities to help the Korean people with water conservancy, production, and good deeds, further enhancing the friendly unity with the Korean people.

The CPV units conduct "China-Korea Friendship Month" activities every February. This year, the CPV leadership has made a plan to contribute 300,000 man-days throughout the year to help the Korean people build water conservancy projects, establish schools, and participate in agricultural production labor. Currently, officers and soldiers of various units are helping the Korean people build water conservancy projects with high revolutionary zeal. One unit decided to contribute 30,000 man-days to help build the Pongmyong Reservoir in North Pyongan Province. The officers and soldiers have already arrived at the construction site on February 11th, ahead of schedule, and are working selflessly. Officers and soldiers of a unit helping the Korean people build the Toksan Reservoir have made great achievements since construction began on February 8th, the anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army. In addition, CPV officers and soldiers are seizing every spare moment to help the Korean people with various production activities such as accumulating fertilizer and delivering manure.

In order to further implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "cherish every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea" and the "Respect the Korean Government, Love the Korean People Covenant" (draft) recently formulated by the CPV Political Department, the leaders of many units are personally holding discussions with local Korean party and government organs and people's organizations during "China-Korea Friendship Month" to solicit their opinions on the troops. Many units have also organized discipline inspection teams to conduct a general inspection of the troops' compliance with mass discipline during the Spring Festival.

The Korean people and army attach great importance to the "China-Korea Friendship Month" activities carried out by the CPV this year. The Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army presented the CPV with four sets of pictures of the Korean People's Army's growth and lent the CPV five films, including "The Tenth Anniversary of the August 15th Liberation" and "Son of the Motherland," for touring screenings and exhibitions. The people of the Central District of Pyongyang also organized a delegation to visit a CPV unit. (Attached picture)

    帮助朝鲜人民修水利搞生产
    志愿军展开中朝友好月活动
    新华社平壤16日电　中国人民志愿军各部队热烈展开“中朝友好月”活动，帮助朝鲜人民修水利、搞生产、做好事，进一步增强与朝鲜人民的友好团结。
    志愿军部队每年2月都要开展“中朝友好月”活动。在今年这个月中，志愿军领导机关作出了全年以三十万人工帮助朝鲜人民兴修水利、建立校舍和参加农业生产劳动的规划。目前，各部队官兵正在以高度的革命干劲，帮助朝鲜人民兴修水利。某部队决定以三万个人工帮助平安北道凤鸣水库的建设，官兵们从2月11日起已经提前开到工地，展开忘我的劳动。帮助朝鲜人民修建德山水库的某部官兵，在朝鲜人民军建军节——2月8日那天动工以来，已经作出了很大的成绩。此外，志愿军官兵还抓紧一切空隙时间，帮助朝鲜人民进行积肥、送粪等各种生产活动。
    各部队为了进一步贯彻执行毛主席“爱护朝鲜一山一水、一草一木”的指示和志愿军政治部最近制定的“尊重朝鲜政府，爱护朝鲜人民公约”（草案），许多部队的首长都在“中朝友好月”中亲自与驻地朝鲜党政机关和人民团体举行座谈，征求他们对部队的意见。许多部队并组织了纪律检查组，准备在春节期间普遍检查一次部队遵守群众纪律的情况。
    朝鲜人民和军队对于志愿军今年开展的“中朝友好月”活动极为重视。朝鲜人民军政治局赠给志愿军四套朝鲜人民军成长壮大的图片和借给志愿军“八·一五解放十周年”、“祖国的儿子”等五部影片，供志愿军部队作巡回放映和展览之用。平壤市中区人民还组织了一个代表团，到志愿军某部队进行访问。（附图片）
