Suining County Promotes the "Well Underneath the Pond" Method

    The Juxing Agricultural Cooperative in Suining County, Jiangsu Province, located in the old course of the abandoned Yellow River, created a "Well Underneath the Pond" method last year. This method connects surface water with groundwater, expanding water sources and increasing the area of irrigation.

    The "Well Underneath the Pond" method is very simple. In an existing pond, a two-meter-long bamboo tube with a diameter of four inches is driven into the bottom. Then, a twelve-meter-long iron pipe, three centimeters in diameter, is inserted into the bamboo tube to create a well at the bottom of the pond, allowing groundwater to spout out of the bamboo tube. Each well can yield 39 cubic meters of water per day, enough to irrigate ten mu of land.

    Because this method is suitable for plains and sloping land, Suining County has begun to promote it throughout the county this year and plans to create more than 11,000 wells underneath the ponds. This will increase the irrigated area by more than 100,000 mu.

    The Xu-Huai area has approximately 30 million mu of land that is of the plains and sloping land type. Recently, representatives from 16 counties and cities in the Xu-Huai area visited and are preparing to promote the method widely. (Attached picture)

### 睢宁县推广汪塘下泉法

    睢宁县推广汪塘下泉法
    江苏睢宁县炬星农业社，位置在废黄河故道，去年创造了一种“汪塘下泉法”，能使地面水与地下水相连，扩大水源，增加灌溉面积。
    汪塘下泉方法很简单。在旧有的汪塘中，打下一根二公尺长、直径四寸的竹筒；再把十二公尺长，直径三公分粗的铁管伸入竹筒，在塘底锥泉，使地下水由竹筒喷出。每眼泉一昼夜可出水三十九公方，能灌溉十亩地。
    这个办法因适用于平原坡地，睢宁县从今年开始在全县推广，并计划在全县汪塘下泉一万一千多个，这样就能增加灌溉面积十万多亩。
    徐淮地区属平原坡地类型的土地约有三千万亩。最近徐淮地区十六个县、市代表都前去参观，并准备普遍推广。（附图片）
