    Exert Great Effort, Accelerate the Elimination of Schistosomiasis
    The Fourth National Conference on the Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis has concluded. This conference summarized the prevention and control work of the past year, determined the prevention and control tasks for this year, and studied how to accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis in the new situation of the great leap forward in socialist economic construction in the future. Representatives from all provinces and cities unanimously supported the battle cry of "exert great effort, make an all-round leap forward, fight hard for three years, and accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis" put forward by the conference. Representatives from some areas with better conditions expressed their determination to basically eliminate schistosomiasis within one or two years, and representatives from some areas with poor conditions also expressed their determination to strive for the upper reaches and compete with advanced areas. This conference was both an appraisal meeting and a promotion meeting. It is foreseeable that after this conference, the struggle of the people in the epidemic areas against schistosomiasis will surely usher in a vigorous great leap forward.
    After the preparation in 1956 and the one-year battle in 1957, the prevention and control of schistosomiasis has achieved great victories. Three hundred and forty-three townships and towns across the country have basically eliminated Oncomelania hupensis snails. Fifteen counties and districts, including Yujiang, Shangyou, Fengxin, Wuyuan, and Fuliang in Jiangxi, Gucheng, Xiangyang, and Daye in Hubei, Cili in Hunan, Qimen and Taiping in Anhui, Deqing and Shaoxing City in Zhejiang, and the eastern and northern suburbs of Shanghai, have basically eliminated schistosomiasis. Past achievements have shown that schistosomiasis can be eliminated not only within the scope of one commune and one township, but also within the scope of one county and one city. The current situation is unprecedentedly favorable for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. In the vast area from Haian and Dafeng in Jiangsu in the east to Jianchuan in Yunnan in the west, and from Sihui and Sanshui in Guangdong in the south to Hanshan and Hexian in Anhui in the north, millions of people, under the leadership of the Party, are making persistent efforts to carry out the elimination of Oncomelania hupensis snails and the management of feces in conjunction with farmland water conservancy construction, accumulation of fertilizer, and the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, and are vigorously arranging the treatment of patients in combination with production. It is now estimated that the time for eliminating schistosomiasis will be greatly advanced compared with the original plan. Facts have powerfully refuted various pessimistic arguments and conservative ideas, proving that accelerating the elimination of schistosomiasis is entirely possible.
    In order to accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis, leaders at all levels must pay attention to improving their work methods and grasp the following three key issues.
    First, we must exert great effort, break conventions, and further criticize conservative thinking. The progress of the prevention and control of schistosomiasis across the country last year was uneven. It is particularly noteworthy that some areas with more severe epidemics and poorer working conditions have moved ahead, while some areas with lighter epidemics and better working conditions have lagged behind. For example, in terms of medical conditions, Shanghai can only be better than Hunan, not worse than Hunan, but Shanghai only completed 30% of its original plan in treating patients last year, while Hunan overfulfilled its original plan of last year by 103%. Is there any ingenious secret in this? If so, it is to exert great effort and dare to break conventions.
    Why are some comrades not motivated enough? This is obviously because their thinking lags behind the situation, and they do not believe in the majority of the masses. The leading organs of the Dali Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan always emphasized the special circumstances at first, and the fecal management work could not be done. However, the east wind of 1958 finally awakened them. In January of this year, the masses of the Dali Autonomous Prefecture warmly responded to the call of the Party, and in the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, they changed the old habits of thousands of years in less than a month, and achieved "every household has a toilet, and every household has a pen." This incident cannot but remind people of an editor's note in "The Socialist Upsurge in the Chinese Countryside." This editor's note teaches us: "The masses have such great socialist enthusiasm. Why did many leading organs not feel it or feel it so little a few months ago? Why is what the leaders think so inconsistent with what the broad masses think? Taking this as a lesson, then, how should similar events and problems be handled in the future? The answer is only one sentence: do not be divorced from the masses, and be good at discovering the enthusiasm of the masses in essence." ("The Socialist Upsurge in the Chinese Countryside" Vol. 1, p. 57) This editor's note, written two years ago, hit the nail on the head and said what is wrong with us today. We must take the sentence "be good at discovering the enthusiasm of the masses in essence" as our motto.
    We are promoters, and our method of building socialism is to do more, faster, better, and more economically. The work of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis, like other tasks, must also break all kinds of conventions that hinder the progress of new things. If we let conventions bind our hands and feet, it will be difficult for us to accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis.
    Second, we must adhere to the leadership method of the mass line. Schistosomiasis is prevalent in twelve provinces and cities, threatening the safety of more than 100 million people. The struggle against schistosomiasis is a very arduous and serious struggle. However, as long as we adhere to the mass line, the more than 100 million people who are seriously threatened by schistosomiasis can be organized into a large army to conquer schistosomiasis. It can be said completely: where the mass line is followed, so that science and technology are combined with mass movements, the prevention and control work there will be carried out vigorously, and it can be guaranteed in quality and quantity. Gucheng, Hubei, one of the fifteen counties and districts that basically eliminated schistosomiasis last year, was only fought by the prevention and control cadres alone before 1956, and only four hundred patients were treated in two years, less than 20% of the total number of patients; as for the work of managing feces and eliminating Oncomelania hupensis snails, it was not done at all. Since 1956, the leading organs of this county have changed their methods, letting go of mobilizing the masses, and the work has greatly changed. 80% of the patients have been cured, the feces have been thoroughly managed, and the Oncomelania hupensis snails have been basically eliminated. This fact once again shows that the power and wisdom of the masses are infinite. Relying on it, everything can be done; separating from it, nothing can be accomplished.
    In terms of leadership methods, we must also learn to use the experience of cultivating experimental fields in agricultural production. Leading personnel must personally grasp typical examples, not only advanced typical examples but also backward typical examples. By grasping these two ends, we can drive the middle and guide the overall situation. Personally grasping one or two counties, cities, or townships, through their own experiments, can make the understanding of leading personnel and the masses tend to be consistent. We must conscientiously formulate plans, and we must absorb cadres from below, especially grassroots cadres, to discuss them together, so that the plans can be as close to the actual situation as possible and become the action goals and work direction of all cadres. We must also hold several appraisals at all levels throughout the year to promote each other, visit each other, and promote each other.
    Third, we must continue to promote all effective experiences and methods. All methods of prevention and control work must adhere to the principles of being beneficial to production and convenient for the masses. We must take a welcoming attitude towards the new prevention and control methods that have emerged among the masses. For example, in the treatment of early and mid-stage patients, the antimony agent three-day therapy has proven to have lighter reactions and shorter treatment time than the twenty-day therapy, while the efficacy is the same as the antimony agent twenty-day therapy. Then, the three-day therapy should not be used instead of the twenty-day therapy. We must not pour cold water to discourage people, and we must not draw one-sided conclusions too early. We must vigorously promote the antimony agent three-day therapy and actively adopt forms such as mobile stationing in communes, delivering medicine to homes, and outpatient clinics. We must adhere to incorporating the treatment plan into the labor plan and work schedule of agricultural cooperatives and production teams, and give full play to the power of both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. There are many ways to eliminate Oncomelania hupensis snails. We should adapt to the time and local conditions. First of all, we must combine the construction of farmland water conservancy and the excavation of mud and fertilizer, and vigorously mobilize the masses to use methods such as opening new ditches and filling old ditches, and reclamation to eliminate Oncomelania hupensis snails. These methods are beneficial to production, save expenses, are easily accepted by the masses, are large in scale, and have good results. Methods such as drugs, burning, and flame spraying to eliminate Oncomelania hupensis snails can be used as auxiliary methods in consideration of the specific local conditions at the time. The management of feces must be carried out in conjunction with the accumulation of fertilizer and the patriotic health campaign. There must be planned use of fertilizer, regular sealing, killing insect eggs, and proper solutions to specific problems such as the use of fertilizer in private plots, so that the work of managing feces can be firmly maintained. At the same time, we must conscientiously and fully mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and use personal protection methods, so that some good results can also be achieved. Last year, Hunan organized 210,000 people to cut lake grass. Because they paid attention to personal protection, no collective infection occurred, which is a powerful proof.
    The vast people in the epidemic areas fought a preliminary battle on the front line of eliminating schistosomiasis in the past two years, and this year is the first major battle to eliminate schistosomiasis. According to the battle tasks put forward at the Fourth National Conference on the Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis, the minimum requirement is that more than one-third of the townships and towns with endemic schistosomiasis will basically eliminate schistosomiasis, 20%-30% of schistosomiasis patients will receive treatment, and feces will be well managed in all schistosomiasis epidemic areas. If this battle is won this year, we can gradually narrow the encirclement circle year by year and strive for the victory of the decisive battle. This year is a year of decisive significance in resolving the battle. We must not slacken our efforts. We must exert revolutionary efforts and fight bravely.
    This year, while fighting against schistosomiasis, all localities must also investigate the prevalence of malaria, hookworm disease, and filariasis, so that when we achieve a decisive victory in annihilating schistosomiasis, we can plan to launch a struggle against the above-mentioned diseases. We must first eliminate the diseases that are most harmful to the people, so that our country can become a prosperous and healthy country. In this sense, accelerating the elimination of schistosomiasis is even more necessary.

    鼓足干劲，加速消灭血吸虫病
    第四次全国防治血吸虫病工作会议已经闭幕了。这次会议总结了去年的防治工作，确定了今年的防治任务，并且研究了在社会主义经济建设大跃进的新形势下，今后如何加速消灭血吸虫病的问题。各省、市代表一致拥护这次会议提出的“鼓足干劲，全面跃进，苦战三年，加速消灭血吸虫病”的战斗口号。有些条件较好的地区的代表表示了在一年或者两年内基本上消灭血吸虫病的决心，有些条件较差的地区的代表也表示了力争上游的决心，同先进地区竞赛。这次会议是一次评比会，也是一次促进会。可以预料，在这次会议后，疫区人民同血吸虫病的斗争，必然会蓬蓬勃勃地出现一个大跃进。
    经过1956年的准备和1957年的一年战斗，血吸虫病的防治工作已经取得了巨大的胜利。全国已有三百四十三个乡、镇基本上消灭了钉螺。江西的余江、上犹、奉新、婺源、浮梁，湖北的谷城、襄阳、大冶，湖南的慈利，安徽的祁门、太平，浙江的德清、绍兴市和上海市的东郊区、北郊区等十五个县、区已基本上消灭了血吸虫病。过去的成绩表明，血吸虫病不仅是在一社一乡的范围内可以被消灭，在一县一市的范围内也可以被消灭。目前的形势对于防治血吸虫病工作是空前有利的。在东起江苏的海安、大丰，西到云南的剑川，南起广东的四会、三水，北到安徽的含山、和县的广大区域内，千百万的群众在党的领导之下，结合兴修农田水利、增积肥料和以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，正在再接再厉地开展消灭钉螺和管理粪便，并结合生产大力安排治疗病人等工作。现在估计消灭血吸虫病的时间，将比原来规划的时间，大为提早。事实已经有力地驳倒了各种悲观论调和保守思想，证明加速消灭血吸虫病是完全可能的。
    为了加速消灭血吸虫病，各级领导必须注意改进工作方法，抓紧下列三个关键性问题。
    第一，必须鼓足干劲，打破常规，进一步批判保守思想。去年全国防治血吸虫病工作的进度是不平衡的。值得我们特别注意的是，有些疫情较重、工作条件较差的地区，反而走在前面，有些疫情较轻、工作条件较好的地区却落在后面。例如，论医疗条件，上海只会比湖南好，不会比湖南差，但是，上海去年在治疗病人方面只完成原订计划的30％，湖南却超额完成去年原计划的103％。这中间难道有什么巧夺天工的秘诀吗？如果有，那就是鼓足干劲和敢于打破常规。
    为什么有一些同志干劲不足呢？这显然是因为他们的思想落后于形势，不相信群众的大多数。云南大理自治州的领导机关，起先总是强调情况特殊，粪便管理工作不能办到。然而1958年的东风终于吹醒了他们。今年1月里，大理自治州群众热烈地响应了党的号召，在以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动中，用一个月不到的时间，改掉几千年的老习惯，做到“家家有厕，户户有圈”。这件事不禁令人记起“中国农村的社会主义高潮”中的一篇编者按语。这个按语教导我们：“群众中蕴藏了这样大的社会主义的积极性，为什么在许多领导机关，在几个月以前，居然没有感觉到，或者感觉的那样少呢？领导者们所想的同广大群众所想的，为什么那样不一致呢？以此为教训，那末，今后对于有相似情况的事件和问题，应当怎样处理才好呢？回答只有一句话，就是不要脱离群众，要善于从本质上发现群众的积极性。”（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”上册57页）这篇写在两年以前的编者按语，一针见血地说中了我们今天的毛病。我们必须把“要善于从本质上发现群众的积极性”这句话当作座右铭。
    我们是促进派，我们建设社会主义的方法是多、快、好、省。防治血吸虫病的工作，同其他各项工作一样，也必须打破妨碍新事物前进的种种常规。假如让常规束缚手足，我们就很难加速消灭血吸虫病。
    第二，必须坚持走群众路线的领导方法。血吸虫病遍布十二个省、市，威胁一亿多人民的安全。同血吸虫病的斗争是一场十分艰巨和严重的斗争。但是，只要我们坚持走群众路线，受血吸虫病严重威胁的一亿多人民就可以被组织起来成为征服血吸虫病的大军。完全可以这样说：那里走了群众路线，使科学技术与群众运动相结合，那里的防治工作就热烘烘地展开，而且能够保质保量。去年出现的十五个基本上消灭血吸虫病的县、区之一的湖北谷城，在1956年以前，仅由防治工作干部孤军作战，两年之内只治疗了四百个病人，不到病人总数的20％；至于管粪便、灭钉螺等项工作根本没有做。从1956年起，这个县的领导机关改变了方法，放手发动群众，工作面貌大为改观，治好了80％的病人，彻底管好粪便，基本上消灭了钉螺。这个事实再一次说明，群众的力量和智慧是无限的，依靠它，什么事都办得到，脱离它，就一事无成。
    在领导方法上，还必须学习运用农业生产上种试验田的经验，领导人员要亲自出马抓典型，不但抓先进的典型，也要抓落后的典型，抓了这两头，就可带动中间，指导全面。亲自抓了一两个县、市或乡、镇，经过自己的试验，就可以使领导人员和群众的认识趋于一致。要认真地订出规划，要吸收下面干部特别是基层干部来共同讨论，使规划尽可能地接近实际情况，成为全体干部的行动目标和工作方向。一年之中还要按级抓几次评比，互相推动，互相参观，互相促进。
    第三，必须继续推广一切行之有效的经验和办法。防治工作的各项办法，必须坚持有利生产、便利群众的原则。我们对于群众中涌现出来的新的防治方法，一定要采取鼓掌欢迎的态度。例如，在治疗早、中期病人时，锑剂三日疗法已经证明比二十日疗法反应轻、治疗时间短，而疗效又与锑剂二十日疗法相同。那就不应该只用二十日疗法而不用三日疗法。我们切不可泼冷水使人泄气，更不可过早地作出片面性的结论。我们必须大力推行锑剂三日疗法，积极采取巡回驻社、送药上门、门诊等形式。必须坚持把治疗计划纳入农业社、生产队的劳动规划和排工计划中去，并且充分发挥中西医的力量。消灭钉螺的方法很多，应该因时因地制宜，首先必须结合兴修农田水利、挖泥积肥，大力发动群众运用开新沟填旧沟、垦殖等方法消灭钉螺。这些做法有利生产，又省经费，群众易于接受，规模大，效果好。药物、火烧、火焰喷射等消灭钉螺的方法，可以斟酌当时当地具体情况作为辅助方法使用。管理粪便必须结合增积肥料和爱国卫生运动来进行，要有计划用肥，定期封存，杀灭虫卵，并且要妥善地解决自留地用肥等具体问题，使管理粪便的工作巩固地坚持下去。同时，要认真地充分地发动群众，组织群众，运用个人防护方法，这样也可以取得一些好的效果。去年湖南组织二十一万群众打湖草，由于注意了个人防护，未曾发生集体感染的事例，就是有力的证明。
    疫区广大人民在消灭血吸虫病的战线上过去两年打的是前哨战，今年是消灭血吸虫病的第一次大会战。根据第四次全国防治血吸虫病工作会议上提出的今年战斗任务是：在流行血吸虫病的乡、镇中最低限度要有三分之一以上的乡、镇基本上消灭血吸虫病，在血吸虫病患者中要有20％—30％的病人受到治疗，在血吸虫病流行地区全部管好粪便。今年这一仗打胜了，以后就可以逐年地缩小包围圈，争取决战的胜利。今年是具有解决战斗的决定意义的一年，我们决不能松劲，必须鼓足革命干劲，奋勇作战。
    今年各地在对血吸虫病作斗争的同时，还要查清疟疾、钩虫病、丝虫病的流行情况，以便在取得歼灭血吸虫病的决定性胜利的时候，有计划地展开对上述的各种疾病的斗争。我们要首先消灭危害人民最严重的疾病，使我国成为富强康乐的国家。从这个意义来说，加速消灭血吸虫病，就显得更加必要了。
