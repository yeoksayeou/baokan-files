　　Last year's yield was 500 jin per mu; this year it will reach 1,000 jin
    Delegate Su Dianxuan reports on the production leap forward of the Xingfu (Happiness) No. 1 Cooperative in Malou Township, Lushan County, Henan Province
    I fully endorse all the reports at the conference and will resolutely implement them when I return to the cooperative. Now, I will talk about the production and living conditions in our cooperative.

    Ten years ahead of schedule, we achieved the production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Program.
    Since we transitioned to an advanced cooperative in January of the year before last, inspired and encouraged by the National Agricultural Development Program proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the men, women, old, and young of our cooperative have been working even harder. Some people said that growing more vegetables could earn more money; some had doubts about reasonable close planting, the promotion of improved seeds, and new farm implements; regarding water conservancy construction, some said that our area has a thick soil layer and cannot dig wells, etc. Our Party branch relied on the majority of the masses, criticized capitalist tendencies and conservative thinking, carried out education on the two roads of capitalism and socialism, and adhered to the production and management policy of focusing on grain. The 27 management committee members planted 38 mu of experimental fields, with an average yield of over 950 jin per mu. We vigorously developed water conservancy, dug 38 new wells, and built 15 water storage pits. Combined with the old wells, this freed all 2,612 mu of land in the cooperative from drought. Crops irrigated with water yielded twice as much as dryland crops. After the autumn drought, the task of replanting 3,650 mu of wheat was quickly completed because we had water. In the past, fertilizer application was less in distant fields and more in nearby fields, and fertilizer was applied in the spring but not in the autumn. We changed this to applying fertilizer universally according to the growth of the crops. In 1957, we applied a total of more than 5.78 million jin of fertilizer, almost twice as much as in 1956. Improved seeds such as Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes, Bima No. 1 and No. 4 wheat, and Golden Queen corn, as well as new farm implements such as double-shared plows and water pumps, have also been promoted in our cooperative. Our cooperative has 124 mu of low-lying land that used to grow nothing. Last year, we planted sorghum and black soybeans and other water-tolerant crops, yielding 210 jin per mu. The cooperative members said, "Old Dragon Bay has become a grain bin." Thanks to the above-mentioned measures, coupled with the efforts of all members of our cooperative, our 3,595.2 mu of grain-growing land yielded 1,838,945 jin of grain, with an average yield of 511.5 jin per mu, an increase of 36 percent over 1956. Among them, 220 mu yielded more than 700 jin per mu, 30 mu yielded more than 800 jin, 5 mu yielded more than 900 jin, and 1.7 mu yielded more than 1,000 jin, achieving the grain production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule (our cooperative is located in the area north of the Huai River and south of the Yellow River).
　　
    A grain-deficient cooperative has become a surplus-grain cooperative; all aspects exceed those of well-to-do middle peasants
    With more grain harvested, our cooperative has transformed from a grain-deficient cooperative into a surplus-grain cooperative. In 1955, the state sold 140,000 jin of grain to our cooperative. In 1956, we achieved self-sufficiency. Last year, we sold more than 300,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The living standards of all 641 households in our cooperative have also improved, and both production and living standards exceed those of well-to-do middle peasants. In the past, our cooperative had 22 well-to-do middle peasant households. Calculated based on the average year of 1946, their average income per person was 76.26 yuan. Last year, our cooperative experienced drought and a major wind and rainstorm. After fighting drought and disaster, it could be considered an average year. However, the average income per person was 82 yuan, which was 6 yuan more than that of well-to-do middle peasants. Although the excess is not too much, that was the old society with heavy taxes and levies. Every household would receive a notice to deliver grain every ten days or so, so the average person only ate 349.5 jin of grain. Now, each person retains 380 jin of grain, and with the self-retained land and the grain distributed to cooperative members after increased production and procurement, it amounts to 450 jin, which greatly exceeds that of well-to-do middle peasants. In terms of farm implements, we have tractors, seeders, new-style walking plows, and double-wheel, double-shared plows. In terms of water conservancy equipment, we have water pumps, waterwheels, 56 wells, and 15 ponds, which can irrigate more than 4,000 mu of land, accounting for 80 percent of the total cultivated area, basically realizing water conservancy. These are even more impossible for the well-to-do middle peasants of the past to achieve. Let's compare eating, clothing, and cultural life. In the past, among the 22 well-to-do middle peasant households, only 15 people wore fine cloth. Now, 2,571 people wear fine cloth. Many cooperative members have floral quilts, cotton-padded coats, fountain pens, rubber shoes, sneakers, leather shoes, thermos bottles, and flashlights. Some individuals even have sewing machines. Our cooperative also has a club, a health clinic, an amateur drama troupe, a sports field, and a people's school. 672 school-age children are enrolled, and 285 students are enrolled in the people's school. We can also watch movies and read newspapers and magazines every month. This rich and colorful life with food and clothing is simply incomparable to that of the well-to-do middle peasants of the past. Why are we able to greatly exceed the production and living standards of well-to-do middle peasants? The cooperative members say: "The leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is good. We have smashed the capitalist road, increased production every year, greatly improved our lives, and must support construction." But we are not satisfied with the past achievements and will continue to work hard to strive for a great leap forward and a bumper harvest this year. When I came, the cooperative formulated a plan: this year, the average grain production target per mu will cross the Yangtze River and reach 1,000 jin. Other cotton and oil crops will also make a great leap forward, and we will provide more grain to support industrialization. If there is anything wrong with my words, please criticize me.

　　去年亩产五百斤  今年要到一千斤
    苏殿选代表报告河南省鲁山县马楼乡幸福一社的增产大跃进
    我完全拥护大会上的各项报告，回到社里坚决执行。现在，我谈谈俺社里的生产和生活情况。
    提前十年实现了农业纲要规定的增产指标
    自从前年一月间转了高级社以后，在党中央和毛主席所提出的农业发展纲要的号召和鼓舞下，我社的男女老少干的劲头更大啦。有人说多种菜能多赚钱；有人对合理密植，推广良种和新式农具有怀疑；对兴修水利，有人说，我们这儿地层厚，不能打井等等。我们的党支部依靠了多数群众，批判了资本主义倾向和保守思想，进行了资本主义同社会主义两条道路的教育，坚持了以粮食为主的生产经营方针。二十七个管理委员种了三十八亩实验田，平均亩产都在九百五十斤以上。大兴水利，打新井三十八眼，修蓄水坑十五个，加上旧井，使全社两千六百一十二亩土地摆脱了旱灾，用水灌溉的庄稼比旱地增产了一倍，秋后闹旱灾，因为有了水，三千六百五十亩小麦的补种任务很快就完成啦。过去上粪是远地少，近地多，麦上秋不上，我们改为根据庄稼生长情况普遍上粪，一九五七年共上粪五百七十八万多斤，比一九五六年几乎多了一倍。胜利一百号红薯，碧玛一号、四号小麦，金皇后玉茭等等优良种子，双铧犁、抽水机等新式农具也都在我社推广开啦。我社有洼地一百二十四亩，过去啥也不长，去年种上了高粱和黑黄豆等耐涝作物，每亩收了二百一十斤，社员们说“老龙湾变成了粮食囤啦”。由于上述种种措施，加上我社全体社员的努力，我社三千五百九十五点二亩种粮地，打了一百八十三万八千九百四十五斤粮食，平均每亩收粮食五百一十一斤半，比一九五六年增产了百分之三十六，其中每亩产七百斤以上的有二百二十亩，八百斤以上的三十亩，九百斤以上的五亩，一千斤以上的一亩七分，提前十年实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的粮食增产指标（我社居于淮河以北和黄河以南的地区）。
　　缺粮社已变成了余粮社各方面都超过富裕中农
    粮食打的多了，俺社由缺粮社变成了余粮社，一九五五年国家售给我社粮食十四万斤，一九五六年达到了自给，去年我们卖给国家余粮三十多万斤。俺社六百四十一户的生活水平也都提高了，不论生产和生活，都超过了富裕中农。俺社过去有富裕中农二十二户，按一般年景的一九四六年计算，平均每人收入七十六元二角六分，去年俺社闹旱灾又闹了一次大风暴雨，经过抗旱抗灾，也算是一个一般年景，然而平均每人收入八十二元，比富裕中农多了六元。虽然超过的还不太多，可是那时候是旧社会，苛捐杂税多，不管那一家十天左右就要接到一张要粮食的条子，所以平均每人吃粮只有三百四十九斤半，现在每人留粮就有三百八十斤，再加上自留地和增产增购后分给社员的粮食就有四百五十斤，大大地超过了富裕中农。在农具上我们有拖拉机，播种机，新式步犁，双轮双铧犁。在水利设备上有抽水机，水车，水井五十六眼，水塘十五个，能浇地四千多亩，占总耕地面积百分之八十，基本上实现了水利化。这些更是过去的富裕中农所根本办不到的。再拿吃穿和文化生活来比一比，过去二十二户富裕中农，只有十五个人穿细布，现在穿细布的就有两千五百七十一人，很多社员都有花被子、棉大衣、钢笔、胶鞋、球鞋、皮鞋、热水瓶、手电筒，个别的人还有缝纫机。俺社还有俱乐部、卫生室、业余剧团、体育场和民校，学龄儿童入学的有六百七十二个，入民校的学员有二百八十五人，每月还能看到电影和报纸杂志，这些有吃有穿、丰富多彩的生活，根本不是过去的富裕中农所能比得上的。我们为什么能在生产水平和生活水平上能大大地超过富裕中农呢？社员们说：“共产党和毛主席的领导好，打垮了资本主义路一条，年年都增产，生活大提高，支援建设要做到。”但我们并不满足过去的成绩，要继续努力，争取今年大跃进、大丰收，我来的时候社里订了个规划，今年粮食生产平均亩产指标，要跨过长江，达到一千斤，其他棉花油料作物也要大跃进，拿更多的粮食支援工业化。我的话有不对的地方请大家批评。
