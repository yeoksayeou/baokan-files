Our newspaper, Shanghai, February 23rd Dispatch: Reporter Ji Yin, Xi Ping reports: The rectification movement in Shanghai's factories and enterprises has recently seen a new leap forward. The Shanghai No. 12 State Cotton Mill is leading the way in realizing this leap. After leading cadres overcame right-leaning conservative thinking and boldly mobilized the masses, the anti-waste movement completely changed in just two days. The number of big-character posters surged from the original 900 to more than 20,000. The momentum of the movement is like a storm, forming an unprecedented general inspection of all backward phenomena.

In this new upsurge, the slogan of the Shanghai No. 12 State Cotton Mill workers is: "Do everything possible, work hard for a year, change the backward situation, and catch up with and surpass advanced factories!" All the workers in the factory have taken action in this movement, forming a mass movement centered on anti-waste and anti-conservatism, driving the work of the entire factory.

The "compare with the advanced" method of establishing opposites has dealt a devastating blow to the conservative and complacent "good enough" mentality.

A significant feature of this movement is that big-character posters widely adopted the "compare with the advanced" method, that is, using advanced indicators to compare with backward indicators, exposing all kinds of conservative and wasteful phenomena that have long been hidden in the shadows to all the factory workers. For example, one big-character poster revealed the factory's cotton consumption. Calculated based on six kinds of cotton cloth, compared with the No. 1 State Cotton Mill and other factories, the No. 1 State Cotton Mill's cotton consumption per yarn was 195.81 kilograms, while this factory required 198.2 kilograms. Last year alone, it consumed 75,000 kilograms more cotton, equivalent to more than 165,000 yuan. Comparing the oil consumption of weaving machines with eighteen factories, it was proven that the factory consumed the most oil. Many other big-character posters exposed problems through internal comparisons within the factory. For example, the material consumption of the first and second fine spinning workshops, calculated based on three materials such as machine oil, yellow tallow, and spindle tapes, showed that the quota of the second fine spinning workshop was higher than that of the first fine spinning workshop. As a result, this workshop spent 80,000 yuan more on material costs in 1957. This method of exposure by establishing opposites nakedly exposed the backwardness and conservatism in the factory's production, giving a devastating blow to the conservative and complacent "good enough" mentality. On these striking big-character posters, workers wrote eye-catching slogans: "We are backward, too backward, hurry up and leap forward!"

Bureaucratism, extravagance, effeminacy, and evil tendencies have been strongly condemned.

Many workers have elevated some wasteful phenomena to the height of ideology for exposure and criticism. Many big-character posters fiercely condemned people's careless and lavish "extravagance" towards state property, condemned the "bureaucratism" of leading cadres, as well as excessive "effeminacy" in the implementation of employee welfare and medical care, and condemned the "evil tendencies" of some technical cadres who do not care about politics and the collective. For example, workers criticized that our factory does not have many workshops, and it takes less than half an hour to walk through all of them, but the leadership spent 20,000 yuan to buy a dispatch telephone, squatting in the office to command, but as a result, the dispatch telephone made the dispatching ineffective, so now it has to be abandoned. Workers said this is a manifestation of "bureaucratism". In terms of employee welfare, when female workers feel unwell, they see a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, and they are all given a bottle of winter tonic, "Dongtian Changchun Gao," to nourish the body. Some are also given Shi Quan Da Bu Wan, cod liver oil, etc., spending a lot of money every year. Workers criticized the leaders, saying "You are making people too pampered".

Criticism and self-criticism have been launched among employees, and everyone is working together to fire at backward phenomena.

Another feature of the big-character posters is that employees have also launched principled criticism and self-criticism among themselves. Workers, technicians, and administrative staff are all working together to fire at backward phenomena. The big-character poster of female worker Cao Yue'e from the first roving workshop revealed the phenomenon of "white cotton in the toilet," and she criticized the behavior of some workers who "take white cotton to the toilet for personal bonuses." Worker Han Shangyi criticized the second opening workshop for lowering indicators in order to allow workers to generally receive bonuses, so that 80% of the people often get bonuses. Technicians also criticized each other for their bourgeois ideas of disregarding national losses and showing off personal accomplishments in their work. In addition, many big-character posters pointed to various unreasonable rules and regulations, especially regarding the reward system, labor wage system, etc., with many opinions. Workers also criticized some unreasonable rules and regulations of higher authorities.

The anti-waste and anti-conservatism wave of the Shanghai No. 12 State Cotton Mill is still moving forward. When reporters went to visit, the number of big-character posters had increased to more than 30,000. The obvious change is that the big-character posters began to calculate accounts and trace the roots more deeply from a political and ideological perspective. This factory has now become a model for factories throughout Shanghai to learn from. Factory representatives coming to visit and learn are constantly flowing in and out. On the 21st alone, there were 75 factories and more than 7,000 representatives who came to learn.

The anti-waste movement of the Shanghai No. 12 State Cotton Mill was originally one of the more backward factories in Shanghai. Why was it able to rise suddenly and become a banner for the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in Shanghai? The reporter interviewed some comrades in the factory about this question. They said that the main experiences of the No. 12 factory are three points.

Experience 1: Fully understand the new situation after the rectification campaign, and fully estimate the consciousness of the masses. They said: The enthusiasm shown by the workers of the No. 12 factory in this wave is the flowering and fruit of the rectification campaign. As early as December last year, after the No. 12 factory went through the rectification campaign and conveyed the spirit of the resolutions of the Municipal Party Congress in January this year, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers began to rise. Before the leadership formally carried out the anti-waste and compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced mobilization, many big-character posters opposing waste, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced appeared, but the leadership underestimated the socialist consciousness of the vast number of workers, underestimated the new situation after the rectification campaign, and had conservative thinking and bureaucratic work style that did not understand the situation, and did not promptly guide the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers to the high tide of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, so that many workers put the written big-character posters in drawers and did not post them. It was not until before the Spring Festival, in the comparison of the municipal party committee's factories, that the leadership discovered the backwardness of the factory, and then decided to light a fire, and as a result, in just two days, the revolutionary fire spread throughout the factory.

Experience 2: Under the new situation, the leadership must resolutely break through the old rules in the work method. They said that in the past, we have long been accustomed to the old set of methods of following the steps, sticking to the rules, and passing down the levels. This work method is no longer able to lead the current revolutionary movement. This time, after learning the experience of brother factories and adopting the method of being consistent to the end, the masses were mobilized, and there were methods everywhere. Many things that were unimaginable and could not be done for a long time could be done. For example, in order to arrange an anti-waste exhibition, the Party Committee instructed the Propaganda Department and the Trade Union to do it. They had been brewing and preparing anti-waste materials and training narrators for a long time, and were preparing to set it up in some appropriate place, but it has not been done for more than half a month. When the masses were mobilized on the afternoon of the 15th, in less than two hours, an exhibition involving fifteen departments and displaying more than 400 kinds of waste and backlog materials was exhibited. Each department also sent its own narrators, and while exhibiting, it was expanding, and the exhibits were crowded and concentrated on the pedestrian road in the center of the factory. In this way, all the locations, personnel, and materials - problems that the leadership thought could not be solved for a while - were all quickly solved. They said: Many facts prove that in such a revolutionary movement, relying solely on a few leading cadres to work with the old methods, and not fully utilizing the collective power of the masses, it is even too late to find a place to post big-character posters. As long as the power of the masses is mobilized, the methods are endless.

Experience 3: We must fully recognize that anti-waste and anti-conservatism is the key to driving all aspects of work in the rectification campaign. They said that the reason why the anti-waste campaign of the No. 12 factory lacked vitality in the previous period and there were only more than 900 big-character posters was mainly because the leadership did not realize that anti-waste and anti-conservatism is not only an economic struggle, but also an ideological and political struggle, and not only to oppose waste and conservatism, but also to oppose the three bad ideologies. Later, after the Municipal Party Committee repeatedly pointed out, they began to clarify the great significance of the movement. And now they have become increasingly clear that the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement has made their factory, which has always been ashamed of being backward, full of vitality and a myriad of phenomena, and many long-standing problems that could not be solved have been dug up, and many problems have been solved or are being solved, and it has truly driven the work of the entire factory. All the workers in the factory now have full confidence that they will get rid of the backward situation and reach the advanced level within one year.

    上海国棉十二厂反浪费反保守运动势如疾风骤雨
    痛击官气阔气　横扫娇气邪气
    本报上海23日电　记者季音、习平报道：上海工厂企业的整风运动最近出现了一个新的跃进，带头实现这个跃进的是上海国棉十二厂。这个厂在领导干部克服了右倾保守思想，放手发动群众之后，反浪费运动在短短的两天内面貌完全改观，大字报由原来的九百张激增到二万多张。运动声势犹如疾风骤雨，形成了一次空前规模的对一切落后现象的总检查。
    这次新高潮里，国棉十二厂职工的口号是：“千方百计，苦战一年，改变落后面貌，赶上和超过先进厂！”全厂职工在这次运动中都行动了起来，形成了一个以反浪费、反保守为中心，带动全厂工作的群众运动。
    树立对立面的“比先进”的揭发办法，使保守自满的“差不多”思想受到毁灭性的打击。
    这次运动的一个显著特色是：大字报普遍采用了“比先进”的办法，即用先进指标对比落后指标，把长期隐藏在暗角里的种种保守浪费现象，统统摆在全厂职工的面前。如一张大字报揭发该厂的用棉量，以六种棉布计算，与国棉一厂等几个厂比，国棉一厂一件纱用棉量一百九十五点八一公斤，该厂却要一百九十八点二公斤，去年一年就多消耗了棉花七万五千多公斤，折合十六万五千多元。织布机器用油，对比了十八个工厂，证明该厂耗油最多。还有许多大字报是通过本厂内部相互对比来揭发的。如一细、二细车间的物料消耗，以机器油、黄牛油、锭带等三种材料计算，二细车间的定额都比一细车间高，这个车间1957年因此多支出了材料费八万元。这种采取树立对立面的揭发办法，赤裸裸地暴露了本厂生产上的落后和保守，给“差不多了”的保守自满思想以毁灭性的打击。在这些鲜明对比的大字报上，职工们写着触目的警句：“我们落后了，太落后了，赶紧跃进！”
    官气阔气娇气邪气遭到猛烈谴责。
    许多工人把一些浪费现象，提到了思想高度加以揭发和批判。许多大字报猛烈地谴责了人们对国家财产漫不经心、大手大脚的“阔气”，谴责了领导干部的“官气”，以及在实行职工福利和医疗方面的过分“娇气”，谴责了一部分技术干部中不问政治，不关心集体的“邪气”。如工人们批评说，我们厂里车间并不多，不到半小时可以全部走到，领导上却花二万元买了部调度电话，蹲在办公室里指挥，结果调度电话反而弄得调度不灵，现在只好不用。工人们说这就是“官气”的表现。在职工福利方面，女工身体不舒服，就看中医，一律发给一瓶冬令补品“洞天常春膏”，滋补身体。有的还发十全大补丸，鱼肝油等，每年花了大量的钱，工人们批评领导说“你们把人弄得太娇了”。
    职工中展开批评和自我批评，大家一齐动手向落后现象开火。
    大字报的另一特色，是职工们相互之间也展开了具有原则意义的批评和自我批评，工人、技术人员、行政管理人员都一齐动手，向落后现象开火。第一粗纱间女工曹月娥的大字报揭露了：“马桶间有白花”的现象，她批评了有些工人“为个人拿奖金，把白花丢在马桶间”的行为。工人韩尚义批评了第二清花间为了使工人普遍得奖金，不惜降低指标，使80％的人经常得奖。技术人员也相互批评了工作中不顾国家损失，表现个人的资产阶级思想。另外还有许多大字报指向种种不合理的规章制度，特别是关于奖励制度，劳动工资制度等等，意见很多。工人们还对上级机关的一些不合理规章制度提出了批评。
    国棉十二厂反浪费、反保守的浪潮现在还在继续前进，当记者前往参观时，大字报又增加到了三万张以上，明显的变化是大字报开始更深入地从政治上思想上算账追根。这个工厂现在已成了上海全市工厂学习的榜样，前来参观学习的工厂代表整日川流不息，仅21日一天，前来学习的即有七十五个工厂，七千余代表。
    国棉十二厂的反浪费运动本来是上海各厂中比较落后的一个厂，为什么它能够异军突起，一跃而成为上海反浪费反保守运动的旗帜？记者就这个问题访问了该厂的一些同志。他们说，十二厂的主要经验有三点。
    经验之一：充分认识整风后的新形势，充分估计群众的觉悟。他们说：十二厂职工在这次浪潮中所表现出来的干劲，是整风运动的开花结果。早在去年12月份，十二厂通过整风和今年1月份传达市党代表大会的决议精神后，职工群众的革命干劲就开始高涨。在领导还未正式进行反浪费和比先进、赶先进的动员之前，就有很多反对浪费、比先进、赶先进的大字报出现，但领导上对广大职工群众的社会主义觉悟估计不足，对整风后的新局面认识不足，存在着保守思想和不了解情况的官僚主义作风，没有及时地把广大职工群众的这种积极性迅速地引导到反浪费、反保守运动的高潮上去，以致许多职工把写好的大字报放在抽屉里没有贴出来。直到春节前，在市委各厂的评比中，领导上发觉了本厂的落后，才下决心放一把火，结果仅两天时间，革命烈火就烧遍了全厂。
    经验之二：在新形势下领导上必须坚决突破工作方法上的陈规。他们说，过去我们长期习惯于按部就班、墨守成规、层层下达的老一套方法。这种工作方法已无法领导当前的革命运动。这次他们学习了兄弟厂的经验，采取了一贯到底的方法后，群众发动起来了，到处都是办法。很多想不到的和很长时间办不到的事情都能作到了。如党委会为了布置一个反浪费展览会，曾责成宣传部和工会去做，很早就酝酿筹备反浪费的物资和训练讲解员，并准备设在什么适当地方，结果半个多月还没有搞起来。当15日下午群众发动起来之后，不到两小时，就展出了一个拥有十五个部门参加的、摆设了四百多种浪费和积压的物资的展览会。各部门还派出了自己的讲解员，而且边展览，边扩大，展品一拥而集中到厂中心的人行道边上。这样一来，所有的地点、人员、物资——这些领导上认为一时解决不了的问题全都迅速地解决了。他们说：许多事实证明，这样的革命运动，单靠几个领导干部老一套的方法去工作，不去充分运用群众集体力量，就连找寻贴大字报的地方也是来不及的。只要把群众的力量发动起来，办法才是无穷无尽的。
    经验之三：必须充分认识反浪费、反保守是整风运动中带动各方面工作的纲。他们说，前一时期十二厂的反浪费所以缺乏生气，大字报只有九百多张，主要原因是领导上没有认识到反浪费、反保守不但是一个经济上的斗争，同时又是一个思想政治的斗争，不但要反掉浪费，反掉保守，而且要反掉三个坏主义。后来经市委一再指出，他们才开始明确了运动的重大意义。而现在他们已愈来愈清楚地看到了，反浪费、反保守运动已使他们这个一向自惭落后的工厂，变得生气蓬勃，气象万千，许多积压已久无法解决的问题都已挖了出来，不少问题已经解决或正在解决，它真正把全厂的工作带动了起来。全厂职工现在都有充分的信心，要在一年内摆脱落后状况，达到先进水平。
