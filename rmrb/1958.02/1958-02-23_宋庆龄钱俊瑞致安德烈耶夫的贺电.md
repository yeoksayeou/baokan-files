Dear Comrade Andrei Yev:

	On the occasion of the glorious 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, on behalf of all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I would like to express our heartfelt and warm congratulations to you, and through you, to the great Soviet people and the heroic Soviet army.

	Over the past forty years, the Soviet Army has traveled a glorious road. It has crushed the imperialist armed intervention against the Soviet Union, defended the achievements of the October Revolution, and in the anti-fascist Second World War, it was the main force in annihilating the German, Japanese and Italian fascist armies. The glorious history of the Soviet Army proves that it is a powerful and reliable defender of the socialist cause and the cause of peace and democracy.

	In the final stage of our War of Resistance Against Japan, the severe blow given to the Japanese aggressors by the Soviet army played an extremely important role in finally defeating Japanese imperialism. The Chinese people will never forget the great internationalist friendship of the Soviet army towards the Chinese people.

	At present, the world situation has undergone tremendous changes, and it is the era of the East wind prevailing over the West wind. The powerful Soviet army has become an important factor in defending world peace and preventing imperialist adventurism.

	We wish
	Long live the heroic Soviet Army!
	Long live the friendly unity between the Chinese and Soviet people and their armies!

			Song Qingling, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
			Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association

    宋庆龄钱俊瑞致安德烈耶夫的贺电亲爱的安德烈耶夫同志：
    当苏军建军四十周年这一光辉节日来临之际，谨代表中苏友好协会全体会员，向你们，并通过你们，向伟大的苏联人民，向英雄的苏联军队表示衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    四十年来，苏联军队走过了极为光荣的道路，它粉碎了帝国主义对苏联的武装干涉，捍卫了十月革命的成果，在反对法西斯的第二次世界大战中，它是歼灭德日意法西斯军队的主力军。苏联军队的光辉历史证明，它是社会主义事业与和平民主事业的强大的可靠的捍卫者。
    在我国抗日战争的末期，苏军给予日本侵略军的严重打击，在最后打败日本帝国主义上面，起了极其重大的作用。中国人民永远不会忘记苏军对中国人民的伟大的国际主义的友谊。
    目前，世界形势已经起了巨大的变化，已是东风压倒西风的时代。威力强大的苏军已成为保卫世界和平、制止帝国主义轻举妄动的重要因素。
    我们谨祝
    英雄的苏联军队万岁！
    中苏两国人民及其军队的友好团结万岁！
              中苏友好协会总会会长　宋庆龄
              中苏友好协会总会秘书长　钱俊瑞
