Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 21st: "Complete seedling cultivation in one year, green the 'four sides' (homes, villages, roads, and waterways) in two years, complete afforestation in three years, and green the entire province in five years." This is the goal determined at the Shandong Provincial Forestry Work Conference held from February 5th to 14th.

The conference believed that forestry work still lags far behind compared to the current situation of overall great leap forward in various tasks. There are still more than 20 million mu of barren mountains and wasteland in the province. Because the forest land coverage is too small, the soil erosion is serious and the resulting drought and flood disasters pose a great threat to agricultural production. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously reverse the backward situation of forestry work. Party and government leading organs at all levels must strengthen their leadership over forestry work, and achieve comprehensive arrangements and unified action for agriculture, forestry, and water. A large-scale greening upsurge must be launched to realize a great leap forward in forestry production.

After criticizing the shortcomings of being divorced from reality and the masses in past forestry work, the conference proposed that in the future afforestation process, every measure must be closely combined with the current interests of the masses, and what trees grow fast and yield large profits should be planted. At present, we must quickly build fuelwood forests and economic forests, and cultivate shrubs and close hillsides for afforestation, in order to solve the difficulties of the masses lacking firewood and money, increase the income of commune members, and increase the coverage area of barren hills.

During the conference, Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, gave instructions. He called on the people of the province to launch an afforestation movement of "every commune afforests tens of thousands of mu, every household plants hundreds of trees." Vigorously promote the experience of the Hongjian Commune in Yiyuan County and the Greening Commune in Linqu County in creating "10,000-mu forests." He said that this is a very good creation. Concentrated and large-scale afforestation can be combined with centralized management of soil and water conservation. It is also convenient for organization and leadership, protection and management, with fast speed and good quality. It can greatly enhance the confidence of cadres and the masses in accelerating greening. He also requested that the afforestation task of 20 million mu of suitable barren hills be completed by 1960, and that protection forest belts be built on all the more than 2,000 kilometers of coastal beaches and windbreak forest networks be built in sandy areas within two years, realizing "greening the four sides" and creating thousands of miles of tree-lined roads. In scenic spots such as Mount Tai and Mount Lao, and cities such as Jinan and Qingdao, greening, beautification, and fragrance should be achieved in advance. He also put forward the call for fruit trees to "go up the mountains and down to the beaches" to open up new orchards, requiring the total output of fruits to reach 2 billion jin by 1962.

At the meeting, many units put forward specific plans for greening in advance. According to preliminary statistics, 27 counties and cities proposed to achieve complete greening this year, more than 2,000 communes planned to create 10,000-mu forest communes, more than 2,000 communes planned to create 5,000-mu forest communes, and more than 3,000 communes planned to create 1,000-mu forest communes; in addition, 5,000 communes planned to plant hundreds of trees per household, and 500 communes planned to plant thousands of trees per household.

Xinhua News Agency: Liaoning Province has decided that forestry should leap forward alongside agriculture, striving to green the "four sides" in three years and the entire province in five years.

This inspiring goal was put forward at the Liaoning Provincial Forestry Work Conference.

The conference discussed in detail the importance and possibility of accelerating greening, criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of some rural leading cadres in forestry production, and exchanged advanced experiences in achieving greening in advance in various places. Many counties proposed to achieve greening in four or five years.

After studying the conditions for accelerating greening in various places, the Provincial Forestry Work Conference believed that the province could achieve greening in five years and "four sides" greening in three years. The conference requested that all localities vigorously strengthen their leadership over forestry production. This year, in addition to consolidating the existing more than 2,000 forestry production teams in the province, agricultural cooperatives in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas should strive to establish professional and part-time forestry production teams. In plain areas, professional seedling cultivation groups should also be established or methods of guaranteed planting and survival should be implemented to improve the production responsibility system. In addition, it is necessary to promote "everyone collecting seeds, every commune cultivating seedlings, and every household cultivating large seedlings" to meet the needs of seedlings in the Great Leap Forward. The conference pointed out that planning should be done well before afforestation, clearly dividing areas suitable for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, so that agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and other productions are closely coordinated and comprehensively developed, to prevent contradictions in land use during the production upsurge.

Xinhua News Agency: Jilin Province has decided to strive to complete the greening of the entire province within five years. This target was put forward at the recently concluded Jilin Provincial Mass Seed Collection and Seedling Cultivation Conference.

The conference criticized the right-leaning thoughts of some cadres in the afforestation cause who were small-handed and small-footed, did not believe in the masses, and did not rely on the masses, as well as the phenomenon of conservatively formulated plans, through a large number of facts. Some cadres in Fushong and Jingyu counties, located in the original forest area of Changbai Mountain, used to think that there were many trees around the county, and it didn't matter if the masses cut some trees without afforestation. Now these two counties have decided to change the original plan of greening the whole county in seven years to be completed within this year. According to conference statistics, the newly formulated seedling cultivation plans of only more than 1,500 agricultural cooperatives (accounting for about one-quarter of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in the province) have reached more than 240% of the province's original seedling cultivation plan for this year, and the afforestation plan has also reached 122% of the province's original plan for this year. Many representatives also put forward the goals of "1,000-mu commune," "5,000-mu commune," "10,000-mu commune," and "ten-tree household," "hundred-tree household," and "thousand-tree household."

    造林工作要迎头赶上新形势
    加速绿化　提前绿化
    山东、辽宁、吉林争取五年绿化全省
    据新华社济南21日电　“一年育完苗，两年绿化四旁，三年造完林，五年绿化全省。”这是2月5日到14日召开的山东省林业工作会议上确定的奋斗目标。
    会议认为：林业工作同当前各项工作全面大跃进的形势相比较，还远远落在后边，现在全省还有两千多万亩荒山荒滩。由于林地复盖面积太少，水土流失严重而造成的旱涝灾害，对农业生产威胁很大。因此，必须大力扭转林业工作落后的局面，各级党政领导机关要加强对林业工作的领导，做到农林水全面安排、统一行动，要掀起一个大规模的绿化高潮，实现林业生产大跃进。
    会议在批判过去林业工作中存在的脱离实际、脱离群众的缺点以后，提出在今后造林的过程中，每一项措施都要和群众的当前利益紧密结合起来，要提倡什么树生长快收益大，就种什么树。在当前，必须迅速营造薪炭林、经济林，并培植灌木和封山育草，以解决群众缺烧柴、缺钱花的困难，增加社员收入，增加荒山复盖面积。
    会议期间，中共山东省委第一书记舒同作了指示。他号召全省人民要开展一个“社社造林千万亩，户户植树千百株”的造林运动。大力推广沂源县红建社、临朐县绿化社创造“万亩林”社的经验。他说这是一个很好的创造，集中成片地大面积造林，既可与水土保持集中治理相结合，又便于组织领导，保护管理，速度快，质量好，可以大大增强干部群众加速绿化的信心。他还要求争取在1960年全部完成二千万亩宜林荒山的造林任务，争取两年内在二千多公里长的沿海沙滩上全部造起防护林带、在沙荒地带普遍营造防风林网、实现“四旁绿化”和创造万里林荫路。在泰山、崂山等风景区和济南、青岛等城市，要提前做到绿化、美化、香化。他还提出果树“上山下滩”开辟新果园的号召，要求1962年果品总产量达到二十亿斤。
    在会上，许多单位提出了提前绿化的具体计划。据初步统计，有二十七个县市提出要在今年达到全部绿化，有二千多个社计划创造万亩林社，二千多个社创造五千亩林社，三千多个社创造千亩林社；另外还有五千个社计划每户植树百棵，五百个社计划每户植树千棵。
    据新华社讯　辽宁省决定林业要与农业并肩跃进，争取三年绿化四旁，五年绿化全省。
    这一振奋人心的奋斗目标，是辽宁省林业工作会议提出的。
    这次会议详细讨论了加速绿化的重要性和可能性，批判了有些农村领导干部在林业生产上的右倾保守思想，交流了各地提前实现绿化的先进经验。有不少县提出要在四、五年内实现绿化。
    全省林业工作会议研究了各地加速绿化的条件以后，认为全省可以在五年内实现绿化，三年内做到
  “四旁”绿化。会议要求各地大力加强对林业生产的领导。今年，除了要把全省原有的二千多个林业生产队整顿巩固以外，凡是山区和半山区的农业社都要争取建立起专业和兼业的林业生产队，平原地区也要建立专业育苗组或实行包栽包活的办法，健全生产责任制。另外要提倡“人人采种，社社育苗，家家户户育大苗”，以解决大跃进中的种苗需要。会议指出，造林前要搞好规划，明确划分宜农、宜林、宜牧地区，使农、林、牧等各项生产密切配合，全面发展，防止生产高潮中产生土地利用上的矛盾。
    据新华社讯　吉林省已经决定争取五年内完成全省绿化工作。这个指标是最近闭幕的吉林省群众采种育苗大会提出的。
    大会通过大量事实批判了有些干部在造林事业上小手小脚，不相信群众和不依靠群众的右倾思想和计划订得保守的现象。地处长白山原始林区的抚松和靖宇两县的某些干部，过去认为县境周围林木较多，群众砍点树，不造林，没有关系。现在这两个县决定把原来七年绿化全县的规划改为今年内完成。根据会议统计，仅一千五百多个农业社（约占全省农业社总数的四分之一）新制订的育苗计划，就达到了全省今年原订育苗计划的240％以上，造林计划也达到全省今年原订计划的122％。许多代表还提出了“千亩社”“五千亩社”“万亩社”和“十株户”“百株户”“千株户”的奋斗目标。
