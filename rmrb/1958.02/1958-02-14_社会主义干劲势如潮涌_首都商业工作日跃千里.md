Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: Among the hundreds of thousands of commercial workers in the capital, a surging high tide of revolutionary great leap forward is rapidly developing, focusing on reducing redundant personnel, breaking through the eight-hour work system that is unsuitable for commerce, improving service quality, accelerating capital turnover, and reducing waste and expenses. This was triggered by the revolutionary initiative full of revolutionary spirit put forward by the workers of the Tianqiao Department Store and the Mishi Street Non-staple Food Store in Beijing.

    Four days ago, the workers of the Tianqiao Department Store and the Mishi Street Non-staple Food Store in Beijing, breaking away from backwardness and breaking old rules, respectively put forward revolutionary initiatives to promote a great leap forward in commercial work. Their revolutionary action was immediately enthusiastically responded to by the workers in the city's commercial and service industries. In recent days, the number of workers visiting the Tianqiao Department Store and the Mishi Street Non-staple Food Store has been endless. In large and small stores, workers are enthusiastically discussing the guarantee conditions for responding to the initiative. Many units' workers do not rest late at night. Letters of determination and guarantee conditions flew like snowflakes to the Party Committee, the Communist Youth League Committee, the Trade Union, and the Manager's Office. The walls and corridors of various stores were covered with colorful big-character posters of workers expressing their determination. Columns of people beating gongs and drums to send challenge letters and present advanced indicators constantly appeared on the streets and alleys. The Wangfujing Department Store had not yet calculated its various indicators when the workers of the Children's Goods Store and the Xidan Department Store came to challenge them, beating gongs and drums. They held group meetings overnight to study the conditions for responding to the challenge, and some groups continued until four in the morning. Workers in Xidan, Dongdan, Qianmen, and the city's service industries have recently held oath-taking rallies to respond to the revolutionary initiative. The workers have expressed their determination to break old rules, catch up with the Tianqiao and Mishi Street stores, and rapidly advance the capital's commercial work.

    Many units' leading cadres and workers are working together day and night to hold meetings to tap potential, formulate indicators for responding to the initiative. During the discussions, the original indicators were broken time and time again, and the final indicators were extremely encouraging. The Xidan Department Store originally set the indicator to reduce personnel by 33%, but after repeated discussions by the workers, it was raised to 40%. The workers said, "40% is still too little. We must compare our enthusiasm with workers and peasants, and work from morning till night in one shift to the end. Personnel can be reduced by 50%." The leather goods and food groups proposed a requirement to reduce personnel by 60%. The working hours of suburban shopping malls were originally longer than those in urban areas. The Beifengwo Shopping Mall in the suburbs also proposed an indicator to reduce personnel by 24% by merging large groups and helping each other. As soon as this method was decided, the workers rushed to move counters and unload goods after business that day, working until three in the morning. The workers of the Second Retail Store of Bicai Hutong in Xidan District proposed to reduce personnel by 47.5%, and all salespersons would work in one shift from morning to night to the end. Their method is to merge some commodity groups, and according to the busy and idle laws of each group's business, support each other when busy. For example, the vegetable and fish group is busy in the morning, and the department store and cloth group are busy in the afternoon, so the salespersons of the two groups support each other when the other is busy. Therefore, after the reduction of personnel, it does not affect the progress of the business at all. The workers of this store also proposed specific measures to save funds and improve service quality. After repeated discussions, the workers of the First Retail Store in Dongdan District decided to reduce personnel by 37%, work one shift a day to the end, improve service quality to catch up with the Tianqiao Department Store before March, and save 33,000 yuan throughout the year.

    In order to improve service quality and facilitate customers, commercial workers have come up with various methods. According to the needs of customers, the workers of each grain store do not care about business hours and decide to sell whenever they come. The salespersons of the Dengshikou Grain Store reduced by 40%, and also proposed to guarantee to deliver grain on time to the fifteen households of old and weak households in the supply area who lack labor. The Pulande Laundry and Dyeing Factory, which moved to Beijing from Shanghai, used to take forty-six days to return clothes to customers during the peak season. Now, it has decided to change it to seven days, and no more than five days during the off-season. At the same time, it has also established a laundry express pickup department; for customers who do not have time to come to the store, they use telephone notifications to pick up and deliver door-to-door. Many restaurants have canceled the midday break. Many photography studios have also decided to shorten the time for delivering photos, from half a month or ten days in the past to five or four days.

    In just four or five days, many gratifying new atmospheres have appeared in the city's commercial and service industries. Many workers in non-staple food stores have walked from the store to the street and set up stalls to sell fish, meat, and groceries, receiving customers in the severe cold; some salespersons pushed mobile trucks to sell at the door of citizens. In order for customers to wear clean clothes during the Spring Festival, the workers of the Hualin Laundry and Dyeing Store got up at four in the morning to work. Many bathhouses and barber shops have broken the conventional practice of fixed working hours and receive customers whenever they come. In order to save expenses, the workers in the service industry in Qianmen District have washed their own work clothes and repaired tools, and the workers in the hotel industry have washed the sheets and quilts rented by passengers without any public remuneration.

    In order to promote the great leap forward in the city's commercial work, relevant cadres at the municipal and district levels have stepped out of their offices, gone deep into various grassroots units, and studied the great leap forward plan with the workers. Party and government leaders at the municipal and district levels also often go deep into the scene to conduct specific guidance. Now, the tide of the great leap forward is rapidly developing, and many workers who have bought train tickets and prepared to go home for the Spring Festival have returned their train tickets and plunged into the tide of the great leap forward.

    社会主义干劲势如潮涌
    首都商业工作日跃千里
    本报特约新华社专稿　在首都十几万商业职工中，一个汹涌澎湃的以减少多余人员、突破对商业不适用的八小时工作制、提高服务质量和加速资金流转、降低损耗费用为中心的革命大跃进的高潮，正迅速地向前发展。这是由北京市天桥百货商场和米市大街副食品商店的职工所提出的充满革命精神的倡议所引起的。
    四天以前，北京市天桥百货商场和米市大街副食品商店的职工摆脱落后、打破陈规，分别提出了推进商业工作大跃进的革命倡议。他们的这一革命行动，立即得到了全市商业和服务性行业职工的热烈响应。连日来，前往天桥百货商场和米市大街副食品商店参观的职工络绎不绝，在大大小小的商店里，职工们热烈地讨论响应倡议的保证条件，很多单位的职工深夜也不休息。决心书、保证条件，雪片似地飞到党委会、团委会、工会和经理室，各商店的院墙和走廊两旁贴满了五颜六色的职工们表示决心的大字报。敲锣打鼓送挑战书和献先进指标的行列，不断地出现在大街小巷。王府井百货商店的各项指标还没有算出来，儿童用品商店和西单百货商场的职工就敲着锣鼓来挑战了，他们连夜开小组会研究应战条件，有的小组开到清晨四点钟。西单、东单、前门和全市服务性行业的职工最近分别举行了响应革命倡议的誓师大会，职工们纷纷表示要打破陈规，决心赶上天桥和米市大街商店，使首都的商业工作迅速向前跃进。
    很多单位的领导干部和职工们在一起，夜以继日地开会挖潜力，制订响应倡议的指标，讨论中原订指标一次一次地被打破，最后订出的指标异常振奋人心。西单百货商场原来订出的指标是减少人员33％，经过职工一再讨论提高到40％，职工们说：“40％还少，我们要同工人、农民比干劲，从早到晚一班顶到底，人员可减50％。”皮件和食品两个组提出了减少人员60％的要求。郊区商场的工作时间原来就比城区长，在郊区的北蜂窝商场采取合并大组和互相帮助的办法，也提出了减少人员24％的指标。这个办法刚一决定，职工们就在当天营业完了以后，赶着搬货柜、倒商品，一直干到清晨三点钟。西单区辟才胡同第二零售商店的职工提出了减少人员47.5％，全体售货员从早到晚一班顶。他们的办法是：合并一些商品组，并根据各组业务忙闲的规律，在忙的时候互相支援。如青菜、鱼肉组早晨忙，百货、布匹组下午忙，两组的售货员就在对方忙时互相支援。因此在人员减少以后，一点也不影响业务的进行。这个商店的职工还提出了节约资金和提高服务质量的具体措施。东单区第一零售商店的职工经过反复讨论，决定减少人员37％，每天工作一班顶到底，在3月份前要使服务质量赶上天桥百货商场，全年节省开支三万三千元。
    商业职工为了提高服务质量，便利顾客，想出了各种各样的办法。各粮店的职工根据顾客需要，不计较营业时间，决定随来随卖。灯市口粮店的售货员减少了40％，还提出保证给供应界内缺乏劳力的十五户老弱户按期送粮。由上海迁京的普兰德洗染厂，过去洗染衣服的时间，旺季需四十六天后才能交给顾客，现在决定改为七天，淡季最多不超过五天，同时还成立了洗衣快取部；对没时间到店的顾客，采用电话通知登门取送的办法。很多饭馆取消了中午休息的规定。许多照像馆也决定缩短交照片的时间，由过去的半月、十天改为五天、四天。
    在短短的四、五天中，全市商业和服务性行业中已出现了许多令人可喜的新气象。很多副食品商店的职工从商店走到街头，把鱼、肉、杂货摆起摊来，在严寒中接待顾客；有的售货员推着流动货车到市民门口出卖。华林洗染店的职工为了让顾客在春节穿上干净的衣服，早晨四点钟就起来工作。很多浴池和理发馆打破了工作时间固定的常规，顾客随来随接待。为了节省开支，前门区服务性行业的职工，已自己动手洗工作服和修理用具，旅店业的职工自己洗旅客租用的床单、被套，不要公家任何报酬。
    为了促进全市商业工作的大跃进，市、区两级的有关干部都走出了办公室，深入到各基层单位，和职工们一起研究大跃进的规划。市、区级的党、政负责人也经常深入到现场，进行具体的指导。现在，大跃进的浪潮正迅速的向前发展，很多买了火车票准备回家过春节的职工，退了火车票，投入到大跃进的浪潮中来。
