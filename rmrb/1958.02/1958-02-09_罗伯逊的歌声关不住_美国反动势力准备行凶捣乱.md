Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch from San Francisco: The renowned Black singer Paul Robeson, who has been illegally banned from giving large-scale performances by the American government for ten years, will perform tomorrow at a concert in the Oakland Municipal Auditorium in California, in commemoration of Black History Week.

Robeson said: "I am very proud of my political views and of being able to fight for the interests of labor, Black people, and peace. I firmly believe that socialism is the way to get rid of poverty." Robeson emphasized that he would never make political "concessions" in exchange for a performance permit.

The news of Robeson's return to the stage has aroused the fear of reactionary forces in the United States. A certain Cook, who calls himself the national commander of the Western Nationalist Crusade, has threatened to use force to disrupt the theater if Robeson performs.

　　罗伯逊的歌声关不住
    美国反动势力准备行凶捣乱
    据新华社8日讯  旧金山消息：十年以来一直被美国政府非法禁止作大规模演出的著名黑人歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊明天将在加利福尼亚州奥克兰市立大礼堂的纪念黑人历史周的音乐会上演唱。
    罗伯逊说：“我以我的政治见解，以能够为劳工、黑人及和平的利益斗争而感到非常骄傲。我深信，社会主义是摆脱贫困的方法。”罗伯逊着重指出，他绝不肯以政治“让步”来换取演唱许可。
    罗伯逊重新上台演唱的消息已经引起了美国反动势力的恐惧。一个自称为西方民族主义十字军全国总指挥的小库克威胁说，如果罗伯逊演唱，他们就要在剧院周围置武力扰乱。
