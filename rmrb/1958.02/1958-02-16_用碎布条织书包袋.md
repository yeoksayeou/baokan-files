    Weaving Book Bags with Scrap Cloth Strips
    Students all need book bags. Making a book bag requires two to three feet of cloth, which does not conform to the spirit of saving cotton cloth. Here is a method for weaving book bags with scrap cloth strips.
    Twist the cloth strips cut from making clothes (more than ten taels are needed) into scrap cloth ropes as thick as chopsticks. Use these ropes (forty to fifty strips) as warp threads on a rectangular "embroidery frame." Then, using a large needle for sewing burlap sacks, thread it with coarse thread used for stitching shoe soles and weave horizontally back and forth through the warp threads as weft (as shown in the picture). After weaving a rectangular piece of rope cloth, fold it in half, sew the two sides together to form a pocket. Then fold the mouth of the bag inward and sew it securely, and attach two coarse cloth rope loops to make an economical, durable and beautiful book bag. (Jian) (Attached picture)

    用碎布条织书包袋
    学生都要用书包。做一个书包，要用二三尺布，这不符合节约棉布的精神。这里介绍一种用碎布条织书包的方法。
    把做衣服剪裁下来的布条（共需十两多）搓成筷子粗的碎布绳。把绳子（四、五十条）在绷长方形的“绣花绷子”上做经线，然后用缝麻袋的大针，穿上扎鞋底用的粗线，一来一往的横织在经绳上做纬（如图）。织成长方形的绳布后，两头对折，把两边缝合起来，就成为口袋。再把袋口向内折缝实，装上两条粗布绳环，就成为一只经济耐用又美观的书包袋了。　（健）（附图片）
