I fully agree with the two reports made by the State Council to the conference and wholeheartedly support the promotion of the Chinese phonetic alphabet.

Since liberation, China's school education has greatly developed. Comparing the number of students currently in school with that of 1949, the number of university students has increased more than fourfold, middle school students nearly sixfold, and primary school students nearly threefold. Such a rapid rate of development in school education is unprecedented. During the First Five-Year Plan, our country's expenditure on education was 10.4 billion yuan, with scholarships alone amounting to 600 million yuan. Currently, about 80 percent of university students receive people's scholarships, which fully reflects the superiority of the socialist system and the state's concern for the younger generation. However, our country is both poor and underdeveloped, with backward economic and cultural conditions. Precisely because of this cultural backwardness, we are required to develop education more rapidly. Precisely because the country is still poor, we cannot increase education expenditures without limit. This is a contradiction. Can this contradiction be resolved? That is, can we run more schools without increasing state expenditure? Can we cultivate more students with less money? According to the practical experience of various regions during this period, the answer is affirmative. The solution is what the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly pointed out: to rely on the masses, follow the mass line, give play to the enthusiasm of the masses in running schools, implement work-study programs, and promote more people-run middle schools, people-run primary schools, and more spare-time schools.

Recently, after undergoing socialist education and raising their awareness, students in many places have launched work-study activities. They study while working, implementing half-work and half-study or half-farming and half-study methods. This is a matter of great significance. It can not only enable us to cultivate more students, but more importantly, it can enable us to cultivate them well, overcome one of the greatest scourges left over from the old society – the separation of books from reality – and enable our work of cultivating the new generation to be as plentiful, fast, good, and economical as economic construction.

Is it possible to run more schools and cultivate more students without increasing state expenditure? Facts have proven that it is entirely possible. That is to fully rely on the masses and implement work-study programs.

Our Central Committee of the Communist Youth League recently held a meeting where many situations in this regard were reflected. In the third junior middle school in Changge County, Henan, 549 students enjoyed scholarships last semester, totaling 5,767 yuan. After implementing work-study programs, the number dropped to 324 students, totaling 2,737 yuan, a decrease of more than half. Last year, the 606 students of this school completed 32,514 workdays during the 80-day summer vacation, earning 16,250 yuan. The student who earned the most earned 71 yuan, and the student who earned the least earned 12 yuan. In Qiuxian No. 1 Middle School in Hebei, 201 students completed 6,949 workdays during the summer and spring vacations, with an average income of 41 yuan per person. As a result, 70 percent of the students who originally received scholarships requested a reduction, and some even requested to give up all scholarships. Some students in the Handan area earn more than 100 yuan a year, which is enough to support themselves and subsidize their families. The experience of these schools proves that implementing work-study programs can indeed reduce the burden on the state and solve all or part of the students' expenses, thereby expanding the student body. The experience of these schools also proves that implementing work-study programs can also help us solve the problem of how to cultivate the new generation, and how to make the students we cultivate meet socialist requirements and standards. It can enable students to receive physical labor training, develop labor habits, learn labor skills, establish a style of hard work and plain living, strengthen ties with the working people, and transform the bad habits left over from the old society of despising physical labor and the working people, while gaining cultural and scientific knowledge. The experience of these schools also proves that with the implementation of work-study programs, there is no need to hold labor education “cram sessions” for students before graduation, nor is there a need to learn to be "apprentices" after reaching production posts. Therefore, it can be said that work-study is an important way to concretely realize the combination of learning and labor, the combination of intellectuals and workers and peasants, and the combination of mental and physical labor. It is an important method for cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and physical health.

Will implementing work-study programs hinder the quality of learning? Facts have proven that not only will it not hinder the quality of learning, but it will also make what is learned more reliable and practical. This is a good way to cultivate both red and expert intellectuals.

Will the implementation of work-study programs hinder the quality of students' learning? If led well, not only will it not hinder it, but it can also improve the quality of learning. Let's take the example of the third junior middle school in Changge County again. Last year, 295 students graduated from this school, and 75 of them went on to higher education, with an enrollment rate of 25 percent. During the same period, the average enrollment rate of schools in the Xuchang area was only 15 percent. Although the quality of learning cannot be completely judged by the number of enrollments, it can be seen from here that because students use their own labor to pay for their studies, it is easier for them to realize the difficulty of obtaining every grain and every meal, and to improve their awareness of learning. Because they learn and do at the same time, they not only memorize the books thoroughly, but also can comprehend them thoroughly, making what they learn more reliable and practical. Now let's talk about the performance of the 220 students who went home to participate in production. Within half a year, 53 of these 220 students were rated as production models by the townships. It can also be seen that work-study programs not only do not hinder the quality of students' learning, but also benefit their ideology, academic performance, and labor training.

After the widespread implementation of work-study programs, will there be so many opportunities? Will it compete with workers and peasants for work and cause conflicts? We say that the problem is not big, mainly depending on how it is arranged. Moreover, students are future laborers, and they will always have to work sooner or later, so there is no question of who is competing for whose work. Specifically, all those who have the conditions should, as Vice Premier Bo Yibo said in his report, establish experimental factories, experimental farms, and experimental pastures individually or jointly with the schools, engaging in teaching and production labor at the same time, and strive to make the school funds self-sufficient, semi-self-sufficient, or partially self-sufficient after a certain period of time. In this sense, the practices of Xi'an First Aviation Technical School and Renhuai County Qunli Farm Amateur Junior Middle School, which produces Maotai liquor in Guizhou, are worthy of great promotion. As for those who do not have the conditions temporarily, in rural areas, they can engage in agricultural and handicraft labor, such as chopping firewood, cutting grass, planting vegetables, accumulating fertilizer, raising pigs, raising rabbits, raising silkworms, catching fish, weaving nets, smashing pebbles, digging medicinal materials, weaving bamboo baskets, and braiding straw hat braids. Through these efforts, our students may be more proficient in labor production than Confucius, and will not be physically lazy and ignorant of the five grains. Of course, in this way, schools will have to consider appropriately reducing the amount of courses, stipulating certain production tasks for experimental farms, and changing the methods of holidays to adapt to the needs of the agricultural season, such as changing the summer vacation to the wheat harvesting and autumn harvesting and autumn planting vacation. In cities, they can participate in the labor of basic construction, transportation, handicrafts, and service industries, such as moving bricks, building roads, surveying, working as waiters, working as tutors, knitting sweaters, pasting paper boxes, wrapping cigarettes, sewing, embroidery, and engraving stencils, printing handouts, sorting books, and repairing furniture in schools. In short, there is a lot of work to be done, and it can all be carried out practically and within one's ability according to the different ages, genders, and physical conditions.

Many students in the United States and Japan are work-study students, and the Soviet Union is also trying out work-study programs. Our country's economy and culture are more backward than these countries, and our students have a glorious tradition of hard struggle. There is no reason not to implement work-study programs.

When I visited Hokkaido University in Japan last year, their student union president told me that 65 percent of the university's students were work-study students. Some sweep the floor of movie theaters, earning 300 yen a day (equivalent to more than one yuan RMB), some serve dishes in restaurants, and some work as temporary workers in coal mines. According to an article in the American magazine "Popular Science," nearly two-thirds of American university students are work-study students. Even at schools like Yale and Harvard, which are for the children of wealthy families, nearly half of the students are self-sufficient, relying on cleaning windows, selling books and newspapers, working as restaurant waiters, driving taxis, and painting houses to make a living. Of course, the situation in our country is different from that in capitalist countries, and the meaning of work-study programs is fundamentally different, but we should and can adopt the method of work-study programs. Some schools in the Soviet Union are now experimenting with extending the length of schooling and implementing three days of schooling and three days of labor, or half a year of schooling and half a year of labor. Our country is poorer than the Soviet Union, and poorer than the United States and Japan, and our culture is much more backward than theirs. Why can they do this, but we cannot? Students in our country have a glorious tradition of hard struggle. Many of our current leaders were trained through work-study programs in the past. Therefore, all ambitious revolutionary youth will wholeheartedly support this method. After the great rectification movement, many students have further realized that it is better to be more hardship in their youth, and they should integrate with the workers and peasants. They can no longer be like intellectuals in the old China, spending 17 years from elementary school to university, just shaking their heads and swaying, completely detached from labor and social life. This detachment is the greatest root cause of intellectuals' contempt for the working people, generating empty, unrealistic, one-sided, extreme, arrogant, and extremely conceited attitudes. Therefore, many students painfully feel the need to live a hard life, the need to personally participate in labor, and to transform and enrich themselves in labor.

In short, work-study programs can reduce state expenditures, expand the student body, increase the proportion of worker and peasant students, improve the quality of learning, and help us cultivate talents who meet socialist standards, both red and expert. This is indeed a matter concerning the fundamental policy of our country's education. Therefore, we should actively and step-by-step universally implement the method of work-study programs in schools across the country, so that our education cause can achieve a great leap forward in both quantity and quality.

　　又多又快又好又省地培养下一代
    项南代表谈只有实行勤工俭学才能促进我国教育事业的大跃进
    我完全同意国务院向大会所做的两个报告，衷心拥护汉语拼音方案的推行。
    解放以后，我国的学校教育有了很大的发展，拿今年在校的学生数来和一九四九年相比较，大学生是四倍多，中学生近六倍，小学生近三倍。学校教育这样快的发展速度是史无前例的。我们的国家在第一个五年计划期间，支出的教育经费是一百零四亿元，单是助学金一项就支出六亿元，现在大学生里约有百分之八十的人领取人民助学金，这件事充分反映了社会主义制度的优越性和国家对于青年一代的关怀。但是我们的国家，是一个又穷又白的国家，是一个经济、文化都很落后的国家，正因为文化落后，所以要求我们更快地发展教育事业，正因为国家还很贫穷，又不能无限制地增加教育经费，这是一个矛盾，这个矛盾能不能解决？也就是能不能在不增加国家开支的情况下多办一些学校？能不能少花一些钱多培养一些学生？根据这个时期各地的实际经验来看，答案是肯定的。办法就是党中央和毛主席多次指出的，要依靠群众，走群众路线，发挥群众办学的积极性，实行勤工俭学，提倡多办民办中学、民办小学和多办业余学校。
    最近许多地方的学生在经过社会主义教育提高了觉悟以后，开展了勤工俭学的活动，他们一边劳动，一边学习，实行半工半读和半耕半读的办法，这是一件有重大意义的事情，它不仅可以使学生培养得多，而更重要的是可以使学生培养得好，克服旧社会所遗留下来的最大祸害之一——书本脱离实际，使我们培养新一代的工作，也像经济建设一样，做到又多又快又好又省。
    在不增加国家开支的情况下，能不能多办一些学校？多培养一些学生？事实证明，完全可能，这就是充分依靠群众，实行勤工俭学。
    我们共青团中央最近开了一次会，会上反映了许多这方面的情况。河南长葛县第三初级中学上学期全校享受助学金的学生是五百四十九人，合五千七百六十七元，实行勤工俭学后，降为三百二十四人，二千七百三十七元，钱数降了一半还多。这个学校六百零六个学生在去年暑假八十天内做了三万二千五百一十四个劳动日，挣了一万六千二百五十块钱，每个学生最多的挣了七十一块钱，最少的也有十二元。河北丘县一中二百零一名学生，在去年暑假和春假一共做了六千九百四十九个工，平均每人收入四十一元。这样一来，原先享受助学金的学生，有百分之七十提出要求减少，有的还要求放弃全部助学金。邯郸地区有的学生一年收入一百多元，除了自给，还可补贴家用。这些学校的经验证明：实行勤工俭学，的确能够减轻国家的负担，解决学生全部或一部分的费用，因而可以扩大学生的队伍。这些学校的经验又证明：实行勤工俭学，还能帮助我们解决如何培养新一代、如何使培养出来的学生符合社会主义的要求和规格的问题。它能够使学生在获得文化科学知识的同时，受到体力劳动的锻炼，养成劳动的习惯，学到劳动的技能，树立艰苦朴素的风气，密切与劳动人民的联系，转变旧社会遗留下来的鄙视体力劳动和劳动人民的恶习。这些学校的经验还证明：实行了勤工俭学，就不用在学生临毕业的时候临时抱佛脚，再来向学生进行“突击”式的劳动教育了，也不用到了生产岗位以后才去学当“练习生”，所以说勤工俭学是具体实现学习和劳动相结合、知识分子和工农相结合、脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的一个重要途径，是培养有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的、身体健康的劳动者的一个重要方法。
    实行勤工俭学会不会妨害学习的质量？事实证明，不但不会妨害学习的质量，而且会使学到的东西更牢靠，更实际，这是培养又红又专的知识分子的好办法。
    实行勤工俭学以后，会不会妨害学生的学习质量？如果领导得好，不但不妨碍，而且能够提高学习质量。还是拿长葛县第三初中做例子，这个学校去年毕业的学生二百九十五人，升上学的七十五人，升学率占百分之二十五，而同一时期，许昌专区各校平均升学率只达百分之十五。虽然学习质量并不能完全看升学的多少来作标准，但从这里可以看出，由于学生是用自己劳动所得来念书的，这就更容易体会到一粥一饭的来之不易，更能提高学习的自觉性；由于边学边做，那就不单是把书本念得烂熟，而且能够融会贯通，使学到的东西更牢靠、更实际。现在再说一说那回家生产的二百二十名学生的表现，这二百二十名学生，半年时间，就有五十三名被乡里评为生产模范，又可见勤工俭学不仅不会妨害学生的学习质量，而且对他们的思想作风、学好功课、劳动锻炼都有好处。
    普遍实行勤工俭学以后，是不是有那么多的门路？会不会和工人农民争活做、闹矛盾？我们说问题不大，主要看怎么安排，何况学生是未来的劳动者，迟早总是要劳动的，并不发生谁争谁的活的问题。具体来说，凡是有条件的都要像薄一波副总理在报告中所说的那样，由学校单独举办或者联合举办实验工厂、实验农场、实验牧场，一面从事教学、一面从事生产劳动、力争在一定时期以后使学校经费达到自给、半自给或部分自给。从这个意义上来说，西安第一航空技工学校和贵州出产茅台酒的仁怀县群力农场业余初级中学的做法，值得大大提倡。至于暂时没有条件的，在农村，可以从事农业和手工业劳动，如打柴、割草、种菜、积肥、养猪、养兔、养蚕、捕鱼、结网、砸石子、挖药材、编竹篮、编草帽辫等。经过这些努力，我们的学生在劳动生产上或许会比孔夫子高明，不会四体不勤、五谷不分。当然，这样一来，学校就得考虑适当减轻课程分量，给试验农场规定一定的生产任务，改变放假的办法，使假期适应农业季节的需要，例如把暑假改为麦收和秋收秋种假。在城市，可以参加基本建设、运输、手工业和服务性的行业的劳动，如搬砖、筑路、测量、当服务员、当家庭教师、打毛线、糊纸盒、包香烟、缝补、刺绣以及在学校里刻钢板、印讲义、整理图书、修理家具等。总之，工作多得很，都可以按照年龄、性别的不同和身体强弱等条件，实事求是、量力而行。
    美国和日本的好多学生都是半工半读，苏联也在试行勤工俭学，我们的国家经济和文化比这些国家都落后，我们的学生又有艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，没有理由不实行勤工俭学。
    去年我访问日本北海道大学的时候，他们的学生会长告诉我，全校有百分之六十五的大学生是半工半读的，有的人给电影院扫地，一天得三百日元（约合人民币一元多），有的到饭馆端菜、有的到煤矿做临时工。据美国“大众科学”杂志一篇文章上说，美国大学生几乎有三分之二是半工半读的，就像耶鲁和哈佛这些供富家子弟念书的学校，也差不多有一半学生自食其力。依靠揩玻璃、出卖书报、当餐厅侍者、驾驶出租汽车、油漆房屋等工作来维持生活。当然，我们的国家和资本主义国家的情况不同，勤工俭学的意义也就根本不同，但勤工俭学这个办法我们却应当而且能够采用。现在苏联有些学校也正在试行延长学制，实行三天念书三天劳动，或半年读书半年劳动的办法。我们的国家比苏联穷，比美国、日本也穷，文化又比他们落后得多，为什么他们能够这样做，而我们却不能这样做？我国学生有艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，我国现在许多领导人过去就是勤工俭学锻炼出来的。所以一切有志气的革命青年是会衷心拥护这个办法的。经过伟大的整风运动，许多学生已经进一步认识到，青年时期还是艰苦一点好，应当和工农群众打成一片，再不能像旧中国的知识分子那样，从小学到大学，整整十七年的时间，只是摇头晃脑，完全和劳动脱节，和社会实际生活脱节。这种脱节现象，正是知识分子轻视劳动人民、产生空空洞洞、脱离实际、片面偏激、目空一切、尾巴翘得一万公尺高的最大根源。所以许多学生都痛感需要过艰苦的生活，需要亲身参加劳动，在劳动中来改造自己，充实自己。
    总之，勤工俭学可以减少国家开支，扩大学生队伍，增加工农学生成份，提高学习质量，有助于我们培养出合乎社会主义规格的、又红又专的人材，这的确是一件有关我们国家教育根本方针的事情，所以应当积极地有步骤地在全国学校普遍实行勤工俭学的办法，使我们的教育事业从数量到质量也来个大跃进。
