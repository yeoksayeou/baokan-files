Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd: Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, recently selected a group of creators and organizers of advanced experiences from agricultural cooperatives in various places to form an "Advanced Technology and Experience Exchange Group." This group has been universally teaching advanced technology and experiences to agricultural cooperative directors and production team leaders in several central areas, which has been warmly welcomed. After more than ten days, over two thousand cooperative directors and production team leaders throughout the county have learned advanced production increase experiences. Some cooperatives have therefore revised their production increase plans, promoting a great leap forward in production.

The "Advanced Technology and Experience Exchange Group" consists of sixteen people. Among them, Du Fengxiang, director of Guangming Cooperative in Changdianpu Township, introduced peanut yield increase experiences to various places. This cooperative adopted technical measures such as selecting and preserving seeds, preparing land to conserve moisture, narrowing ridges and increasing rows, single-seed uniform sowing, and increasing application of manure, creating an average yield of 543 jin per mu (Northeast mu, where one mu equals 1.5 standard mu) on 823 mu of peanut land, more than doubling the yield of ordinary peanut production nearby. The director of Taiyang Cooperative in Taiyang Township introduced the experience of increasing corn yield to an average of 862 jin per mu. Guchengzi Township introduced the advanced experience of small-ridge wide-sowing millet, yielding more than 800 jin per mu. In addition, there were experiences in increasing the production of rice and miscellaneous grains, livestock feeding and management, pig production, and fertilizer accumulation.

An Yonggui, director of Hongcheng First Cooperative in Xichengzi Township, in the "Advanced Technology and Experience Exchange Group," also specifically introduced the lessons learned in promoting new technologies to various places. In 1956, when promoting new corn yield increase technologies, this cooperative was once the highest corn-yielding cooperative in the county, with a yield of over 900 jin per mu for double-stalk corn; however, last spring, a cold wind swept through the cooperative, negating the experience of reasonable close planting of corn, resulting in a reduction of more than 90,000 bundles of corn and a total reduction of 230,000 jin for the entire cooperative last year.

　　把先进技术及时传给群众
    先进经验创造者亲自传授技术
    群众欢迎　效果显著
    新华社沈阳3日电　辽宁省新金县最近从各地农业社中挑选了一批先进经验的创造者和组织者，组成“先进技术经验交流团”，在几个中心地区向农业社主任、生产队长普遍传授先进技术经验，受到热烈欢迎。经过十多天时间，全县有二千多名社主任和生产队长学到了先进增产经验。有的社因此重新修订了增产计划，促进了生产大跃进。
    “先进技术经验交流团”由十六人组成。其中长甸堡乡光明社主任杜丰祥向各地介绍了花生增产经验。这个社采取选种保种、整地保墒、缩垅增行、单粒匀播、增施粪肥等技术措施，在八百二十三亩（东北亩每亩合市亩一亩半）的花生地上创造了平均亩产五百四十三斤的成绩，比附近一般花生产量提高一倍多。太阳乡太阳社主任介绍了玉米平均亩产八百六十二斤的增产经验。古城子乡介绍了小垅宽播谷子亩产八百多斤的先进经验。此外还有水稻、杂粮的增产经验、牲畜饲养管理经验、生猪生产经验和积肥经验等等。
    “先进技术经验交流团”中的西城子乡红城一社主任安永贵，还专门向各地介绍了推广新技术中的教训。这个社1956年在推行玉米增产新技术时，曾经是全县玉米产量最高的社，双株玉米每亩产量达九百多斤；但是去年春季，社里刮起一阵冷风，否定了玉米合理密植的增产经验，结果去年全社少产了玉米九万多捆，共减产二十三万斤。
