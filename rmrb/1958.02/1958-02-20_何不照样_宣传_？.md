    Why Not "Publicize" in the Same Way?
    According to Mr. Stone, the Far East Bureau Chief of the United States "International News Service," the major peaceful initiative of the Chinese People's Volunteers to completely withdraw from Korea "boldly seized the initiative and placed the United States in an awkward position."
    However, in order to cover up this fact, the United States is resorting to the same old tricks, claiming that the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers is merely a form of "propaganda." Commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea, Decker, even feigned composure, saying that the "intentions" of the Chinese People's Volunteers' withdrawal from Korea were "unclear" and that they "must wait and see."
    In fact, what is "unclear" that requires "waiting and seeing"? If this is "propaganda," why doesn't the United States also carry out "propaganda" in the same way and withdraw its troops from South Korea?

### 何不照样“宣传”？

    何不照样“宣传”？
    美国“国际新闻社”远东总分社社长斯通说，中国人民志愿军准备全部撤出朝鲜的重大和平行动，“大胆地掌握了主动，使美国陷于难堪的境地”。
    但是，美国为了掩盖这一事实，又在搬出老一套的手法，说什么中国人民志愿军的撤退，不过是一种“宣传”。侵朝美军司令德克尔还故作镇定，说什么中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的“意图不明确”，他们“必须等着瞧”。
    其实，有什么“不明确”的地方，须要“等着瞧”的呢？如果说这是“宣传”，美国为什么不也照样来一个“宣传”，撤退自己在南朝鲜的军队呢？
