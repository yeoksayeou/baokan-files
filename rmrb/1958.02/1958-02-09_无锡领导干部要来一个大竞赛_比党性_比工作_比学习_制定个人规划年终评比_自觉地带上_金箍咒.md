　　Wuxi Leading Cadres to Hold a Grand Competition
    Compare Party Spirit, Compare Work, Compare Learning
    Formulate Personal Plans and Conduct Annual Evaluations; Voluntarily Put on the "Golden Hoop"
    (Our Report) In order to thoroughly eliminate bureaucratic airs and conduct a socialist competition among leading cadres to compare Party spirit, compare work, and compare learning, the Wuxi Municipal Party Committee recently passed a creative resolution at an enlarged meeting. The Wuxi Daily published an editorial entitled "Leading Cadres Must Take the Lead in the Competition," which specifically elaborated on the significance and content of this competition.
    The "comparing Party spirit" aspect of the competition requires, as pointed out in the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening Party Spirit," achieving the goal of "subordinating individual interests to the interests of the whole Party, subordinating the interests of individual constituent parts of the Party to the interests of the whole Party, so that the whole Party is united like one person." "Comparing work" means comparing scientific Marxist leadership methods, with each cadre spending four to six months of each year going deep into the grassroots and contacting the masses, and all work being done through "experimental plots." "Comparing learning" means comparing being both Red and expert, earnestly studying the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies, studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, studying socialist education courses, studying scientific and technical skills related to one's profession, studying history, literature, logic, grammar, and rhetoric, and also learning the local language and Mandarin. Everyone should strive to become a Red and expert intellectual of the working class within the prescribed time limit.
    The method of comparison is that each person starts from their own actual situation to make a personal plan (mainly for 1958, including a five-to-ten-year long-term plan), which will be compiled into a booklet by the Municipal Party Committee, with each person having a copy to encourage and supervise each other. This year, several checks will also be conducted within the branch organizations of each unit, and an annual evaluation will be carried out at the end of the year.
    The Wuxi Municipal Party Committee's resolution has played a promoting role in urging leading cadres to eliminate bureaucratic airs and completely change their work style. Cadres believe that the formulation of personal plans, coupled with evaluation and competition, is like voluntarily putting a "golden hoop" on themselves, which is both conscious and voluntary and binding, which spurs everyone to make a great leap forward in Party spirit, work, and learning.

　　无锡领导干部要来一个大竞赛
    比党性　比工作　比学习
    制定个人规划年终评比　自觉地带上“金箍咒”
    本报讯　彻底打掉官气，在领导干部之间开展一个比党性、比工作、比学习的社会主义竞赛，这是最近在中共无锡市委扩大会上通过的一项富有创造性的决议。无锡日报特为此发表了一篇题为“领导干部要带头竞赛”的社论，具体阐述了这个竞赛的意义和内容。
    竞赛中提出的比党性就是按照“中共中央关于增强党性的决定”中指出的，要做到“把个人利益服从于全党的利益，把个别党的组成部分的利益服从于全党的利益，使全党团结得像一个人一样。”比工作就是比马克思主义的科学的领导方法，每个干部每年深入基层、联系群众四个月到六个月，一切工作都通过“试验田”。比学习就是比又红又专，认真学习党中央的方针政策，学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，学习社会主义教育课程，学习自己本行本业的科学技术业务，学习历史、文学、逻辑、语法、修辞，还要学习本地语言，学习普通话。每个人都要力争在规定的期限内成为党的工人阶级的又红又专的知识分子。
    比的方法就是各人从自己的实际情况出发，作出个人规划（以1958年为主，包括五年到十年的远景规划），由市委汇编成册，人手一本，互相勉励，互相督促。今年，还要在本单位的支部组织中进行几次检查，年终进行评比。
    无锡市委的这一决议，对督促领导干部打掉官气，彻底改变作风起了促进作用。干部认为：制定个人规划，再加上评比竞赛，就好像给自己自觉地带上“金箍咒”，既是自觉自愿的，又是有约束力的，这就鞭策大家一定要在党性上、工作上、学习上来一个大跃进。
