The Shanghai Yeast Factory Provides a Good Example
Eliminating the Four Pests and Emphasizing Hygiene Promotes Production Development

(Reported by our newspaper) Since the local state-owned Shanghai Yeast Factory launched the patriotic health campaign, production conditions have greatly improved due to the leadership's attention. The quantity and quality of products have increased year by year, and it was rated as an excellent unit in Shanghai for eliminating the four pests in 1956. At present, there are basically no flies or mosquitoes in the factory, no bedbugs in the dormitories, and sputum stains have been eliminated indoors. From the first quarter to the third quarter of last year, the employee morbidity rate and absenteeism rate due to illness decreased by an average of 16.6% and 8.9% respectively compared with the same period of the previous year, and continued to decrease in the fourth quarter; the quality of products last year increased by an average of more than 10% compared with the previous year, and the qualified rate of products leaving the factory reached 100% (the requirement is more than 98%); in the past, the maximum output of the main product, yeast, was about 700 kilograms per set, but now it has increased to more than 1,000 kilograms per set, and other products have also increased.

The Yeast Factory is a factory that manufactures food products such as yeast, maltose, malt (raw material for beer), and malt extract. The hygiene requirements for the products are very strict. Previously, the factory's hygiene was very poor, with mold and bacteria growing in the products, and garbage, small insects, and even flies were often found. In 1955, there were a total of thirty to forty tons of returned goods, and users and consumers had many complaints. The newspaper once criticized it. Starting in the spring of the year before last, the leading cadres of this factory attached importance to the leadership of hygiene work, combined production to mobilize the entire factory to eliminate the four pests, established various hygiene systems, improved environmental sanitation, and improved product quality, making the qualified rate of products for the entire year before last 77% higher than in 1955, basically eliminating the phenomenon of returns, and becoming an excellent factory for eliminating the four pests.

Since last year, the factory's Patriotic Health Movement Committee, under the personal leadership of the factory director, has strengthened various hygiene propaganda activities and insisted on implementing various hygiene systems. Originally, the entire factory was required to have a major cleaning once a month, but since last year, there have been two or three major cleanings of the entire factory every month. Each time, the factory's leading cadres and doctors, together with all the factory's employees, used lime slurry and bleaching powder solution to pour soil to kill insects, overturn tanks and drain water, eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and not only cleaned the workshops and the factory environment, but also swept the area more than 20 meters around the factory gate. At ordinary times, the physicians of the health station used the spare time of outpatient visits to inspect the hygiene of every corner of the workshops, kitchens, canteens, dormitories, toilets, bathrooms, and walkways, and often carried out hygiene propaganda in the workshops. At the end of the year before last, the yeast workshop (the main workshop) started the mass health worker system, with each team electing a health worker to supervise each other's hygiene work and product hygiene specifications. After several months of trial implementation, this mass hygiene supervision system was formally established in the second quarter of last year (it will be extended to all workshops in the factory in the first quarter of this year). In the labor competition of the factory's four major workshops and various teams, the indicators for eliminating the four pests, regular hygiene work (clean handover system), and guaranteeing product hygiene are all included in the production guarantee conditions and evaluation conditions.

The food hygiene work of the kitchen and canteen is also a key point. The health station physicians and cooks have achieved close cooperation. The physicians go to the kitchen every day to provide hygiene guidance, improve the cooks' hygiene knowledge (inspecting and supervising the kitchen three or four times a day in summer), and ensure that no food poisoning or intestinal infectious diseases occur among the factory's dining employees since last year.

Since the yeast factory uses rice and wheat as raw materials and is located in the suburbs, the production process attracts flies and is prone to water accumulation and mosquitoes, so the task of eliminating the four pests is heavy. The factory has established a reward system for eliminating the four pests. Teams or individuals with good results in eliminating the four pests can be regularly rewarded or commended (criticized if they do poorly). Therefore, eliminating the four pests has become a daily habit for every employee. In the past eleven months of last year, the entire factory eliminated a total of 1,100,700 flies, 43,000 mosquitoes, more than 150 rats, and many other pests.

Now, the entire factory is launching a major cleaning campaign focusing on eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies. (Zheng Shilian)

    上海酵母厂提供好例证
    除四害讲卫生促进了生产发展
    本报讯　地方国营上海酵母厂开展爱国卫生运动以来，由于领导重视，卫生状况大为改善，产品的数量和质量逐年提高，曾被评为1956年度上海市除四害优秀单位。目前，厂内已基本上无蝇无蚊，宿舍无臭虫，室内消灭了痰迹。去年第一季度到第三季度，职工发病率和因病缺勤率比前年同时期平均降低16.6％和8.9％，第四季度继续降低；产品质量去年比前年平均提高10％以上，产品出厂的合格率达到100％（要求是98％以上）；过去主要产品酵母每套最高产量七百公斤左右，现在提高到每套一千公斤以上，其他产品也有提高。
    酵母厂是一个制造酵母、饴糖、麦芽（制啤酒的原料）、麦精等食品的工厂，产品的卫生要求很严格。以前，厂内卫生搞得很差，产品中有霉菌、细菌生长，经常发现垃圾、小虫甚至苍蝇。1955年共有退货三、四十吨，用户和消费者意见很多，报纸曾经提出批评。前年春天开始，这个厂的领导干部重视了对卫生工作的领导，结合生产动员全厂除四害，建立各项卫生制度，改善了环境卫生，提高了产品质量，使前年全年产品合格率比1955年提高77％，基本上消灭退货现象，成为除四害的优秀工厂。
    去年以来，该厂爱国卫生运动委员会在厂长亲自领导下，加强各项卫生宣传，坚持执行各项卫生制度。原来规定全厂每月大扫除一次，去年以来全厂性的大扫除每月总有两三次。每次扫除厂的领导干部和医生同全厂职工一起用石灰浆、漂白粉溶液浇土灭虫，反缸倒罐，清除积水，消灭蚊蝇孳生地，不但清扫车间和厂内环境，而且还扫到离工厂大门二十多公尺的周围。在平时，保健站的医师利用门诊空隙时间到车间、厨房、食堂、宿舍、厕所、浴室、走道等每个角落去检查卫生，并且经常到车间进行卫生宣传。前年年底酵母车间（主要车间）开始了群众卫生员制度，由每个小组推选一个卫生员，对车间卫生工作和产品卫生规格进行相互监督，经过几个月的试行，去年第二季度正式订立了这个群众卫生监督制（今年第一季度将推广到全厂各车间）。全厂四大车间和各小组，在劳动竞赛中，除四害的指标、经常性卫生工作（清洁交班制）和保证产品卫生等要求，都列入生产保证条件和评比条件。
    厨房、食堂的饮食卫生工作也是个重点，保健站医师和炊事员取得密切合作，医师每天到厨房进行卫生指导，提高炊事员卫生常识（夏季每天三、四次到厨房检查督促），保证了去年以来全厂用膳职工不发生食物中毒和肠传染病。
    酵母厂由于用米麦做原料，又地处近郊，生产过程引诱苍蝇，容易积水生蚊，因此除四害工作繁重。厂内订了除四害奖励制度，除四害成绩好的小组或个人能定期受到奖励或表扬（差的批评），因此，除四害已成为每个职工日常的习惯。去年十一个月中，全厂共消灭苍蝇一百一十万零七千多只，蚊虫四万三千多只，老鼠一百五十多只，以及其他许多害虫。
    现在，全厂又开展了以消灭过冬蚊蝇为主的大扫除。（郑士连）
