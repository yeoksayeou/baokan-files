Xinhua News Agency, 7th - The Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, held a press conference this afternoon to introduce the important contents of the statement issued by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5th. Ambassador Li Yong-ho also announced that the Korean Embassy had received today the statement issued by the People's Republic of China in support of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He requested that journalists from all countries provide broad and impartial coverage of the above two statements.

The Ambassador said that the Korean government regards it as its noble task to take appropriate countermeasures to eliminate the threat to peace caused by the United States imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique creating a new war, to ease tensions, and to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and therefore issued the statement of February 5th. When talking about the point in the statement that demands the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, Ambassador Li Yong-ho said that the fundamental factor threatening the peace of Korea and hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea is the presence of American troops in South Korea. He pointed out that the introduction of atomic weapons into South Korea by the U.S. military is a blatant violation of the armistice agreement and an act of escalating tensions in Korea. The Ambassador also condemned the recent large-scale atomic war exercises conducted by U.S. and South Korean troops near the military demarcation line.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho explained the proposal that elections could be held under the supervision of a neutral nations supervisory commission after the withdrawal of foreign troops. He said that the neutral nations supervisory commission should supervise that all political parties and social figures in North and South Korea enjoy freedom of activity, speech, publication, assembly, and association during the election process, rather than interfering in election affairs.

The Ambassador pointed out that regarding economic, cultural exchange, communication, and travel between North and South Korea, the Korean government has repeatedly put forward reasonable suggestions, but all have been rejected by U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho said that the Korean government has reduced its armed forces by 80,000 men and has proposed that North and South Korea each reduce their armed forces to 100,000 or fewer in the shortest possible time.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho said that the above-mentioned proposals put forward by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea not only conform to the deep aspirations of the Korean people, but also conform to the interests of peace-loving people all over the world. Our government firmly believes that the realization of the above measures will contribute to the peaceful reunification of Korea and the maintenance of peace in the Far East.

　　朝鲜驻华大使李永镐举行记者招待会
    阐明朝鲜政府声明的重要意义
    新华社7日讯　朝鲜驻华大使李永镐7日下午举行中外记者招待会，介绍朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府2月5日发表的声明的重要内容。李永镐大使并且宣布朝鲜大使馆今天已经收到了中华人民共和国为支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府而发表的声明。他要求各国记者广泛地对上述两项声明进行公正的报道。
    大使说，朝鲜政府把采取适当对策，消除由于美国帝国主义和李承晚集团制造新战争而造成的对和平的威胁，缓和紧张局势和促进祖国的和平统一当作自己的崇高任务，因而发表了2月5日的声明。在谈到声明中要求一切外国军队撤出朝鲜这一点时，李永镐大使说，威胁朝鲜和平、阻碍朝鲜和平统一的基本因素是美国军队驻在南朝鲜。他指出，美军把原子武器运入南朝鲜，是粗暴地破坏停战协定，加剧朝鲜紧张局势的行为。大使还谴责最近美军和南朝鲜军队在军事分界线附近进行的大规模的原子战争演习。
    李永镐大使解释了外国军队撤出以后，选举可以在中立国机构监督下进行这一建议。他说，中立国机构应当监督在选举过程中南北朝鲜的一切政党和社会人士享有活动、言论、出版、集会和结社等自由，而不是干涉选举事务。
    大使指出，关于南北朝鲜之间的经济、文化交流和通信、往来，朝鲜政府曾经一再提出合理建议，但是都遭到美国帝国主义和李承晚集团的拒绝。
    李永镐大使说，朝鲜政府已经裁减了武装部队八万人，并且建议南北朝鲜在最短期内各把武装部队减至十万人或十万人以下。
    李永镐大使说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提出的上述建议，不仅符合朝鲜人民的深切愿望，而且也符合全世界爱好和平人民的利益。我国政府深信，上述措施的实现将对和平统一朝鲜和维护远东和平作出贡献。
