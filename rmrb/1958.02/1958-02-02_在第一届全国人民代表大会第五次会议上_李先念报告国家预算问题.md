Xinhua News Agency, February 1st. Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian delivered a report on "The Implementation of the 1957 State Budget and the Draft 1958 State Budget" at the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress this afternoon.

Li Xiannian first pointed out that the implementation of the 1957 state budget was good. The overfulfillment of the 1957 national fiscal revenue and expenditure plan not only ensured the completion of the construction plan for the last year of the First Five-Year Plan, but also powerfully demonstrated the strong vitality of the socialist system, and shattered the slanders of the bourgeois rightists against China's financial and economic situation. The result of the implementation of the 1957 state budget was that both fiscal revenue and expenditure exceeded the original plan, and revenue exceeded expenditure. It should be said that the state finance achieved remarkable and encouraging results in 1957.

Li Xiannian said that according to estimates, the original budget revenue for 1957 was 29.394 billion yuan. The actual revenue was 30.702 billion yuan, which was 104.45% of the original budget. The original budget expenditure for 1957 was 29.394 billion yuan, and the actual expenditure was 30.549 billion yuan, which was 103.93% of the original budget. Last year, the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure offset each other, and revenue exceeded expenditure by 1.106 billion yuan. Of this surplus, apart from 153 million yuan belonging to the local budget being retained by the localities, the remaining 953 million yuan belonging to the central budget has been allocated to the bank as credit funds and included in the expenditure items for 1957. The result of the implementation of the 1957 budget was not only that revenue exceeded expenditure with a certain surplus, but also that the amount of currency in circulation in the market was reduced, and the stock of commodities and materials was increased.

Li Xiannian pointed out that the victory of the state's financial work in 1957 was achieved on the basis of the movement for increasing production and practicing economy led by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and on the basis of the victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle carried out by the people of the whole country.

Li Xiannian said that the implementation of the 1957 state budget proves that in all financial and economic work, we must fully recognize the great role of human factors and political factors, and we must fully recognize the great role of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people under the new socialist relations of production. Fully recognizing these roles will enable us to maintain full confidence, determination, and revolutionary vigor in the face of any difficulties.

Li Xiannian said that politics serves the economic base, it is the guarantee of economic work, and at the same time it is the commander and soul of economic work and all other work. As Chairman Mao said: "Political work is the lifeblood of all economic work. This is especially true in a period when socio-economic systems are undergoing changes." When the financial and economic situation encountered some temporary and local difficulties in the winter of 1956, we once made some inappropriate estimates of certain individual problems in financial and economic work (such as spending more money on capital construction). However, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao immediately pointed out the correct direction for us, telling us that we must distinguish between the main stream and the tributaries, the essence and the phenomena, and instructing us that as long as we resolutely mobilize the masses to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, some of the difficulties at that time would definitely be significantly improved in a few months. The development of the financial and economic situation in 1957 fully proved the correctness of this prediction. This is a lesson worth noting for all government workers, especially financial and economic workers.

Li Xiannian then reported on the arrangement of the state budget revenue and expenditure for 1958. He said that 1958 is the first year of China's Second Five-Year Plan. In order to build China into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as quickly as possible, the people of the whole country are actively striving to implement the policy of developing socialist construction in a faster, better, and more economical way, and strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within the next fifteen years or a little longer, strive to realize the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft) ahead of schedule, and strive to approach or reach the world's advanced level in the urgently needed scientific and technological departments in a not-too-long time. Under the slogans of "See the five years in three years, and see the three years in the first year" and "Three years of hard work," the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and all working people is unprecedentedly high, the spirit of the whole nation is invigorated, and everyone is involved in the competition to catch up with the advanced and make further progress. Under these circumstances, it is entirely possible for the national economy to achieve a new leap forward in 1958.

He pointed out that the current international situation is very favorable for this historically significant effort of the Chinese people. 1957 was a new turning point in world politics, and the East Wind clearly prevailed over the West Wind. This truth is becoming clearer and clearer. The strength of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is growing day by day, the strength of the international proletariat is growing day by day, and the international forces advocating peace are growing day by day, while the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is increasingly falling into chaos and passivity. Obviously, the sooner we build socialism, the more we will contribute to world peace.

Li Xiannian said that adapting to this situation, the 1958 state budget is a budget that opposes conservative tendencies, actively explores potential, and increases revenue and expenditure relatively quickly; a budget that implements the spirit of the rectification campaign, resolutely opposes waste, and resolutely tightens non-productive expenditures; and a budget that actively increases productive expenditures, actively develops capital construction, and vigorously supports agriculture. The 1958 state budget revenue is 33.063 billion yuan, and the state budget expenditure is 33.063 billion yuan, and revenue and expenditure are balanced. Compared with the estimated implementation figures for 1957, the 1958 budget shows an increase of 2.242 billion yuan in revenue, an increase of 7.27%; and an increase of 2.395 billion yuan in expenditure, an increase of 7.81%, calculated according to the method of compiling the 1958 budget. He then explained some of the characteristics of this year's budget expenditure:

1. In the 1958 budget expenditure, the economic construction costs and social, cultural and educational expenses are 22.44 billion yuan, while in 1957 it was 19.6 billion yuan, and its proportion increased from 64.17% in 1957 to 67.88%; the national defense costs and administrative expenses in 1958 are 7 billion yuan, while in 1957 it was 7.83 billion yuan, and its proportion decreased from 25.63% in 1957 to 21.17%. He pointed out that this budget is fundamentally contrary to the arms expansion and war preparation budgets of the United States and other imperialist countries. Not only has the proportion of China's national defense expenditures and administrative expenses in the national budget been further reduced, but the absolute figures have also been greatly reduced. This fact fully demonstrates the ardent desire of the Chinese people to engage in peaceful labor, and demonstrates the determination of the Chinese government to tighten state organ expenditures to accelerate the development of socialist construction. The reduction of state organ expenses does not mean the weakening of their work, on the contrary, it will be conducive to strengthening their work. This reduction is not only of great significance economically, but also of greater significance politically. He said that our government is the people's government, and our army is the people's army. We should have the ambition and determination to do the most with the least money, so that our government and army become the most ideal government and army serving the people.

2. In the allocation of investment in capital construction in 1958, the investment in capital construction in social, cultural and educational, and administrative management aspects was reduced, and the investment in capital construction in economic construction was increased. Among the investments in economic construction, the needs of key construction projects were first ensured, while investments in agriculture, water conservancy, chemical fertilizer industry, and agricultural machinery industry were emphatically increased, and investments in fuel industry, power industry, raw material industry, urgently needed machinery industry and other weak links were appropriately increased.

3. The expenditure on agriculture in the 1958 state budget has greatly increased, totaling 2.94 billion yuan, an increase of 40.78% over last year. In addition, the state also supports agriculture through credit methods such as issuing loans and pre-purchasing agricultural products.

After talking about three issues in the report, including improving the financial management system, improving the enterprise financial management system, and improving the management of agricultural loans, Li Xiannian focused on the importance of opposing conservatism, opposing waste, and using a large-scale movement to increase production and practice economy to ensure the realization of the 1958 state budget in the final part of the report. He said that in order to complete and strive to over fulfill the 1958 state budget, it is necessary to continue to deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy throughout the country. All provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and even all grassroots units should launch competitions on increasing production and practicing economy in various departments, conduct regular evaluations, and summarize at the end of the year to see which units have made greater achievements. All enterprises, departments, and units must spend about ten days during the rectification campaign to specifically launch a great airing of views, a great debate, and a great struggle on the issue of anti-waste, and mobilize the power of the broadest masses to conduct an irreconcilable struggle against various waste phenomena.

Li Xiannian finally said that our country is still an economically and culturally backward country. In order to build our country into a strong socialist country, we must be diligent and thrifty so that we can invest more funds in national construction. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao not only put forward the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, but also put forward the policy of managing the family diligently and thriftily. Therefore, thrift is not only the task of all state workers and economic workers, but also the common task of all the people. Only when the whole country, from top to bottom, strives to increase accumulation and save funds can China's construction cause develop rapidly.

　　在第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议上
    李先念报告国家预算问题
    新华社1日讯　国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念今天下午在第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议上，作了“关于1957年国家预算执行情况和1958年国家预算草案的报告”。
    李先念首先指出：1957年国家预算执行情况是良好的。1957年国家财政收支计划的超额完成，不但保证了第一个五年计划最后一年的建设计划的完成，而且有力地证明了社会主义制度的强大生命力，粉碎了资产阶级右派分子对于我国财政经济状况的污蔑。1957年国家预算的执行结果是，财政收入和支出都超过了原计划，并且收入多于支出。应该说，1957年的国家财政获得了显著的、令人鼓舞的成绩。
    李先念说，根据预计，1957年原预算收入二百九十三亿九千四百万元，执行结果收入三百零七亿零二百万元，是原预算的104.45％；1957年原预算支出二百九十三亿九千四百万元，执行结果支出三百零五亿四千九百万元，是原预算的103.93％。去年国家财政收入和支出相抵，收入超过支出十一亿零六百万元。这个超过的部分，除了属于地方预算的结余一亿五千三百万元仍然留给地方以外，属于中央预算的结余九亿五千三百万元，已经作为信贷资金增拨给银行，列入1957年支出项下。1957年预算执行的结果，不仅做到收多于支，有一定的结余，而且减少了一部分市场货币流通量，增加了一部分商品物资库存。
    李先念指出，1957年国家财政工作的胜利，是在中共中央和国务院所领导的增产节约运动的基础上取得的，是在全国人民进行整风运动和反右派斗争胜利的基础上取得的。
    李先念说，1957年国家预算执行的情况证明，在一切财政经济工作中，必须充分地认识到人的因素、政治因素的伟大作用，必须充分地认识到劳动人民在新的社会主义生产关系下的革命积极性的伟大作用。充分地认识到这些作用，就会使我们在任何困难面前都能保持充分的信心、坚定性和革命的干劲。
    李先念说，政治是为经济基础服务的，它是经济工作的保证，同时又是经济工作和其他一切工作的统帅和灵魂。正如毛主席所说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生变革的时期，尤其是这样”。当1956年冬财政经济情况遇到某些暂时的局部的困难的时候，我们曾经一度对财经工作中的某些个别问题（例如基本建设上多用了一些钱）作了一些不适当的估计。但是党中央和毛主席随即给我们指出了正确的方向，告诉我们必须分清事物的主流和支流、本质和现象，指示我们只要坚决发动群众开展增产节约运动，当时的一些困难，在几个月以后就一定可以有显著的好转。1957年财政经济情况的发展，完全证明了这个预见的正确。这对于所有政府工作人员特别是财经工作人员，都是一个值得注意的教训。
    李先念接着报告了1958年国家预算收支的安排。他说，1958年是我国第二个五年建设计划的第一年。全国人民为了尽可能迅速地把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国，正在积极努力，贯彻执行又多又快又好又省地发展社会主义建设的方针，争取在今后十五年或者稍多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），并且争取在不太长的时间内，在急需的科学技术部门接近或者达到世界先进水平。在“五年看三年，三年看头年”和“苦战三年”的口号鼓舞下，广大的工人、农民和全体劳动人民的热情空前高涨，全民族精神振奋，生气蓬勃，大家都卷入了落后赶先进、先进再前进的竞赛浪潮中。在这种情况下，1958年的国民经济完全有可能实现一个新的跃进。
    他指出：目前国际形势对于我国人民这个有历史意义的努力是十分有利的。1957年是世界政治的一个新的转折点，东风显著地压倒了西风，这个真理现在越看越清楚了。以苏联为首的社会主义国家的力量日趋壮大，国际无产阶级的力量日趋壮大，主张维护和平的国际力量日趋壮大，而以美国为首的帝国主义集团则日益陷于混乱和被动。很明显，我们建成社会主义越早，我们对世界和平也就贡献得越多。
    李先念说，适应这种形势，1958年的国家预算，是一个反对保守倾向、积极挖掘潜力、收入和支出增长得比较快的预算，是一个贯彻整风精神、坚决反对浪费和坚决紧缩非生产性支出的预算，是一个积极增加生产性支出、积极发展基本建设和大力支援农业的预算。1958年国家预算收入三百三十亿六千三百万元，国家预算支出三百三十亿六千三百万元，收支是平衡的。1958年预算同1957年预计执行数字比较，按照1958年预算编列的方法计算，收入增加二十二亿四千二百万元，增长7.27％；支出增加二十三亿九千五百万元，增长7.81％。他接着说明了今年预算支出的一些特点：
    一、1958年的预算支出中，经济建设费和社会文教费是二百二十四亿四千万元，而1957年是一百九十六亿元，它所占的比重由1957年的64.17％上升到67.88％；国防费和行政管理费1958年是七十亿元，而1957年是七十八亿三千万元，它所占的比重由1957年的25.63％降低到21.17％。他指出，这个预算同美国和其他帝国主义国家的扩军备战的预算根本相反，我国的国防费用和行政费用不但在国家预算中所占的比重进一步降低了，而且绝对数字也有了很大的减少。这个事实充分地表明了我国人民从事和平劳动的热烈愿望，表明了我国政府紧缩国家机关经费以加速发展社会主义建设的决心。国家机构费用的节减，决不意味着它们的工作的削弱，相反地这将有利于它们的工作的加强。这一节减不但在经济上具有重大的意义，而且在政治上具有更重大的意义。他说，我们的政府是人民的政府，我们的军队是人民的军队，我们应该完全有志气和决心花最少的钱作最多的事，使我们的政府和军队成为最理想的为人民服务的政府和军队。
    二，在1958年基本建设的投资分配上，缩减了社会文教和行政管理方面的基本建设投资，增大了经济建设方面的基本建设投资。在经济建设方面的投资中，首先保证了重点建设的需要，同时着重地增加了农业、水利、化学肥料工业、农业机械工业的投资，适当地增加了燃料工业、电力工业、原材料工业、急需的机械工业和其他薄弱环节的投资。
    三、1958年国家预算中用于农业方面的支出大大增加，共有二十九亿四千万元，比去年增长40.78％。此外，国家还通过发放贷款和预购农产品等信用方式对农业进行支援。
    李先念在报告中讲了关于改进财政管理体制、关于改进企业财务管理制度和关于改进农业贷款的管理等三个问题之后，他在报告的最后一部分，着重讲了反保守、反浪费、用大规模的增产节约运动来保证实现1958年的国家预算的重要意义。他说，为了完成和争取超额完成1958年的国家预算，必须在全国范围继续深入地开展增产节约运动。全国各省、自治区、直辖市直到各基层单位，都应该就各部门的增产节约展开竞赛，定期评比，年终总结，看看哪些单位成绩更大。各企业、各部门、各单位都必须在整风运动中抽出十天左右时间，专门就反浪费问题展开大鸣大放大争大辩，动员最广大群众的力量，同各种浪费现象作不调和的斗争。
    李先念最后说，我国现在仍然是一个经济上和文化上都落后的国家。为了把我国建设成为一个社会主义的强国，我们必须克勤克俭，以便能把更多的资金投入国家建设中去。中共中央和毛主席不但提出了勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办合作社、勤俭办一切事业的方针，而且还提出了勤俭持家的方针。因此，节约不仅是全体国家工作人员和经济工作人员的任务，而且是全体人民的共同任务。只有全国上下都努力来增加积累、节约资金，我国的建设事业才能迅速地发展。
