I want to sing!

　　I, standing on this solemn and respectful rostrum, do not intend to make a speech, but to sing. Sing of the revolutionary drive of the 600 million people inspired by the nationwide rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, and the vigorous new leap forward and new atmosphere manifested in all aspects. It's a pity that I am not a "thrush" good at singing, and cannot be as the poet Su Dongpo described: "Who knows the sound of glee, also has endless meanings."

　　Opening the newspaper, especially after listening to the good news brought by the representatives from the countryside, factories, mountains, and plains, there are too many things to sing about. Just to mention a few new people and new things, which one is not a beautiful "ode" or "epic"? Which one is not worth singing about? Singing is endless! After all, I am not a singer, so let's be honest! The beautiful and moving songs and poems that cannot be sung should be sung by the real singers present today, such as Bai Yang, Guo Lanying, Tian Hua, Wang Kun, Chang Xiangyu, Lang Xianfen, and Chen Shufang! Here, I will only talk about the situation of intellectuals after the nationwide rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle.

　　Intellectuals should recognize their class attributes, be determined to shed their airs, participate in labor training, and thoroughly transform themselves. This is a great leap forward in ideology and politics from the old stage to the new stage.

　　1957, especially the second half of 1957, was a period of storms and rains for some intellectuals. "The moon is bright, the wind is clear, what a good night!" This was the elegance most loved by ordinary intellectuals in the past. In the early spring weather, when it is still cold, they already find it difficult to rest, so in the midst of storms and rains, they cannot help but be frightened. These are the intellectual rightists. We waged a sharp and fierce struggle against the rightists on the two fronts of the political and ideological war. The rightists were crushed, and we were victorious. This is the power of the Party and the people, and this is the inevitability of history.

　　In the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, the broad masses of intellectuals participated in this battle, and we immediately saw that righteousness was rising and evil was declining. Many intellectuals were determined to shed their airs, transform themselves, apply to go to the countryside and mountains, participate in productive labor, and pass the socialist test well. This is a great revolution for the intellectuals themselves, and also a great leap forward for the intellectuals in ideology and politics from the old stage to the new stage. No wonder Elder Xie (Juezai) couldn't help but write a poem in his "New Year's Day Letter to Cadres Sent Down" to sing about this exciting and encouraging situation. He wrote:

　　Who laments the difficulty of the road, going down to the countryside and up to the mountains. The countryside is a treasure land,
　　The mountains are beautiful. Labor creates everything, with thousands of patterns.
　　Sowing, planting, plowing, harrowing, reaping, only then is there food on the plate.
　　Workers are diligent and skillful, only then is there merchandise. Bow down to labor,
　　Only then will you know the sweet, sour, and salty. Grassroots workers, have countless knowledge.
　　What is learned from books is insignificant and not worth mentioning. People welcome you,
　　You are not just playing around. Physical and mental strength, trained into one.
　　"Nothingness" and "Capitalism" are completely destroyed, rooting out the enemy. His name is: Passing the Socialist Test.

　　This is a teaching, an encouragement, and a true depiction for intellectuals. These are intellectual leftists. They have set an example for the vast number of intermediate intellectuals. Isn't this worth singing about? Let us sing together with Elder Xie!

　　The above is one situation. Another situation is that after the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle, the broad masses of intellectuals have improved in all aspects, especially in their understanding of the entire intellectual community and the intellectuals themselves. What is the political stance and ideological consciousness of the entire intellectual community? What is its class attribute and worldview? Is it working-class intellectuals or bourgeois intellectuals? Is it the working-class worldview or the bourgeois worldview? Before the anti-Rightist struggle, this was vague. Generally, the entire intellectual community and themselves were overestimated. "The petty intellectuals of the proletariat cannot lead the big intellectuals of the petty bourgeoisie" (Rightist Luo Longji). "The Marxist-Leninist books I have read are not necessarily less than those read by your Party theorists" (Rightist Zhang Naiqi). So on and so forth, countless examples. Look at how high their intellectual tails are cocked up! Under such circumstances, intellectuals are just intellectuals, there is no distinction between left, middle, and right, they are all "I am the greatest," they are all "experts." In January 1956, Premier Zhou Enlai made a "Report on the Question of Intellectuals," which truthfully pointed out for us: In our enterprises, schools, organs, and society, there are still intellectuals with various erroneous views and attitudes. For example, they do not distinguish between the enemy and us; they are nostalgic for capitalism, even feudalism; they oppose the Soviet Union, refuse to study Marxism-Leninism, and even slander Marxism-Leninism; they despise labor and the working people; they not only often create disputes and opposition between intellectuals and the Party, but also create disputes and opposition among intellectuals; they are arrogant, thinking they are the best in the world; they deny the interests of the people and the interests of society, and look at all problems from the perspective of personal interests, supporting what is in their own interests and opposing what is not. Premier Zhou continued: "People with all these errors are very few among the current intellectuals; but people with one or several of the above errors are not few. Not only backward elements, but also some intermediate elements, often have some of the above-mentioned erroneous views. Narrow-mindedness, arrogance, and looking at problems from the perspective of personal interests are still quite common among progressive elements."

　　The intellectuals with various erroneous views and attitudes pointed out by Premier Zhou are basically bourgeois intellectuals. The distinction between backward, progressive, and intermediate, that is, the political division between left, middle, and right, is also a long-existing objective fact. However, at that time, most intellectuals did not recognize these, and at the same time, they did not care about these. The rectification and anti-Rightist struggle first educated the broad masses of intellectuals, making them realize the bourgeois nature of the intellectual community, the bourgeois nature of themselves, the dual nature of bourgeois intellectuals, and at the same time, they also realized the objective existence of the political division between left, middle, and right of bourgeois intellectuals and the importance of transforming bourgeois intellectuals. Thus, the political and ideological level was improved, and the major issues of right and wrong in politics were clarified, especially on key issues, they realized that they must accept the leadership of the Party and take the socialist road. But in the past, the understanding of these key issues was also insufficient. Not to mention the rightists who were accustomed to playing double-dealing tricks, even most of the centrists only had an abstract understanding of accepting the leadership of the Party and taking the socialist road. Once they encountered concrete problems, they were just as Premier Zhou said: "They support what is in their own interests and oppose what is not." The rectification and anti-Rightist struggle isolated the rightists, educated most of the centrists, and also improved the leftists. Thus, it is possible for the intellectual community to form a large contingent of working-class intellectuals to serve the great leap forward in all aspects of socialist construction, and it is also a great leap forward for the intellectuals themselves.

　　The rectification and anti-Rightist struggle have brought us endless strength, enabling us to win victories in the socialist revolution on all fronts - the economic front, the political front, and the ideological front. After that, we must win an even greater victory, especially in the revolution aimed at the intellectuals themselves.

　　Spring is here, and this is another extraordinary spring, with birds singing and flowers fragrant, and all things renewed. In this great time, the nation that has awakened, the intellectuals that have awakened (although they are still basically bourgeois intellectuals), as long as they are determined to transform themselves, there is no force that can stop the pace of progress. What is most feared is that they do not have a clear understanding of their own class attributes and overestimate themselves.

　　After the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle, most intellectuals have a certain understanding of themselves, but there are still many muddled ideas. For example, some people cannot understand the concept of bourgeois intellectuals ideologically. They say that in the past, intellectuals were generally called petty-bourgeois intellectuals. After the five major movements and the three major transformations, why have they been "upgraded" to bourgeois intellectuals instead? Some also say that intellectuals do not occupy factories, nor do they occupy land, so where does the title of bourgeoisie come from? Obviously, these are all looking at the problem from a formal perspective, without touching the class stand and class essence of intellectuals. Formalist philosophy is essentially bourgeois philosophy. Since they still doubt the concept of bourgeois intellectuals, they will inevitably doubt the duality of bourgeois intellectuals at the same time, especially for intellectuals to participate in productive labor for transformation, they are even more doubtful. Some people say that Lenin believed that the transformation of scientists and engineers should follow their own path to recognize communist ideas. Why promote intellectuals to participate in productive labor and training? Some believe that the key to the transformation of intellectuals lies in their own efforts, and participating in labor production is not important; some also say that peasants have been working for thousands of years, but their thinking is still backward. Some veteran cadres who have been trained for many years still make mistakes. What are the benefits of participating in productive labor? Even if there are benefits, it can only solve the "red" problem, not the "expert" problem; some even say that to have scientists participate in productive labor is to use "steel" as "wood." These issues cannot be answered one by one here. Little do they know that the main condition of social existence is labor, is production; the development of the entire history is the result of the labor and production of the working people; labor not only created the world, but also created man himself. Therefore, Chairman Mao taught us: "Man's productive activity is the most basic practical activity, the activity that determines all other activities." Participating in productive labor is now an important revolutionary measure, and at the same time, it is a move to change customs and habits that keeps intellectuals from divorcing themselves from reality and from the masses, and dialectically unites mental and physical labor!

　　Intellectuals should neither be arrogant nor inferior, should not speak rashly when they want to, should not remain silent, should not act recklessly when they want to, should not remain inactive, but should have a sense of ownership, be accustomed to using the democratic method of great airing, great debate, and arouse strong will to be promoters of the revolution.

　　The characteristics of intellectuals are either arrogance or inferiority (but the dominant aspect is arrogance). After the anti-Rightist struggle, the arrogance of most intellectuals has been reduced somewhat, but it has inevitably increased the sense of inferiority in some people (actually, it is a sense of inferiority produced from disapproval). Even if he no longer publicly compares the Party to a mother-in-law and himself to a daughter-in-law, he always does not have a sense of ownership. He always sees the relationship between the people and him, or the Party and him, as a master-servant relationship. He always feels uncomfortable and unnatural in front of the people or in front of the Party. He never feels that he is one of the masters of this magnificent and splendid socialist building. Without a sense of ownership, one cannot link one's personal destiny with the destiny of the working people, the hopeful destiny of the nation, and the great communist cause. Under the socialist system, one cannot see the increasingly active role of the masses in social development, one cannot see one's own historical role as the real master, and one cannot muster a strong revolutionary will, and one cannot demand oneself to be a revolutionary promoter. This is very dangerous for the progress of every intellectual. Therefore, we must affirm our main position in all aspects of life. Only socialist society for the first time shows that every person is not an object of pity and sadness, but the true master and creator of life, and the master of his own destiny. Only starting from this attitude can intellectuals clearly and far-sightedly see that the times are advancing, and they are also advancing with the times. Thus, they can see the relationship between themselves and the working class, and the Party, as only a relationship of leadership and being led, not a relationship of master and servant, and naturally there is no relationship of unequal status, seeing it as a relationship that is increasingly consistent and increasingly unified in politics and spirit, not a relationship that is increasingly contentious and mutually opposed. Everyone is always unified in the warm socialist family, although this is still a unity of some kind of contradiction, but the contradiction within the people is always the premise for the continuous leap forward of the new socialist stage and the new socialist people. Therefore, inferiority, self-effacement, negativity, and pessimism are all without any basis.

　　However, in a small number of intellectuals, especially in intellectuals with high or relatively high political and social status, there is still a certain sense of inferiority and a negative and pessimistic tone. They dare not or are unwilling to regard themselves as masters, which is a situation that deserves attention.

　　This situation is particularly reflected in the understanding of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Although the rightists used the airing and contending to frantically attack the Party, the people, and socialism, the policy of airing and contending has always been adhered to, and will continue to be adhered to for a thousand years and ten thousand years. Because this is one of the important methods to correctly handle contradictions among the people, and it is also an important method to prosper science and art. The Party and the government not only adhere to this policy in academic and ideological circles, but also apply it to the broad masses of working people in the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle. The broad masses of working people have not only learned to use the methods of great airing, great contending, great debate, and posting big-character posters to improve their work, set off a climax, and correctly handle contradictions among the people, but also used this set of methods to gain experience in dealing with the contradictions between the people and the bourgeois rightists, who were the enemy. However, some intellectuals who won the victory in the anti-Rightist struggle are now negative and rarely air and contend, and rarely debate. Airing and debating are not only a method and policy for handling contradictions among the people and prospering science and art in policy, but also have become the most extensive, deepest, and most lively democratic form of socialist democracy in practice. The broad masses of working people will use and love this democratic form, and are expanding this democratic form. However, some intellectuals who often feel that socialist democracy is not enough are instead indifferent to it, and dare not or are unwilling to use this democratic form. They either speak rashly, or remain silent, they either act recklessly, or remain inactive. This is a situation that deserves even more attention.

　　In the current rectification and reform stage, intellectuals mainly rectify and reform their own positions and worldviews, that is, to establish the working-class position and the working-class worldview. Intellectuals in the intermediate state should become the main object of rectification and reform. Leftists should also continue to transform and improve.

　　The above briefly reflects some of the situations of intellectuals after the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle. But this is very insufficient, because the appearance and inner activities of intellectuals in the intermediate state are extremely complex. The socialist drive inspired by the rectification will play a long-term role. Now the rectification is turning to the third stage - the rectification and reform stage. For intellectuals, it is to rectify and reform themselves, mainly to rectify and reform their positions. Position is the fundamental starting point that people use to observe and deal with all problems in society. Either it is the working-class position, or it is the bourgeois position, there is no middle position. Intellectuals must have an unwavering working-class position in politics, accepting the leadership of the Party and taking the socialist road. At the same time, it is to rectify and reform the worldview. The worldview is people's general view and attitude towards the world. It is the point of view, method, and theoretical system that people adopt when observing and analyzing and even solving problems in nature and society. Either it is the working-class worldview, or it is the bourgeois worldview, there is no middle worldview, and there is no neutral philosophy. Intellectuals must arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism in their ideological system, and use the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism, that is, the working-class worldview, as their own worldview.

　　The political centrist position and the ideological philosophical neutralism will essentially help the rightists in some situations. Therefore, the issue of position and worldview is essentially the issue of class nature and Party spirit principle. Many intellectuals have placed class nature and Party spirit principle in opposition to scientific nature and human nature (or individuality), and insisted that Marxism-Leninism is full of the one-sidedness of propaganda utilitarianism, and said that the relationship between class nature and Party spirit principle and scientific nature and human nature (or individuality) is a tragic contradiction that can never be overcome, thereby regarding the transformation of the class position of intellectuals and the insistence on the Party spirit principle when looking at problems as some political instructions, precepts, and orders issued by the Party and the government to the intellectual community, and are unwilling to accept them. This is an extremely serious erroneous view, and it is also a view that is quite representative among intellectuals. In particular, it is even more intolerable to regard Marxism-Leninism, which embodies the fundamental interests and ideological feelings of the working people, is full of the warmth of the socialist family, and inspires great hope, as the erroneous view of bourgeois utilitarianism. These erroneous views or erroneous thoughts are all concrete manifestations of the extremely ugly bourgeois essence. Therefore, "the Party always insists that bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals must be thoroughly transformed." (Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping)

　　Intellectuals in the intermediate state are the majority, and they should become the main object of transformation or rectification and reform. But leftists must also continue to transform and improve. Rightists will also "have a part that will turn around and re-accept transformation. This is possible and is what we hope for. We do not want the rightists to go to the end of the road." (Minister Li Weihan)

　　This means that all bourgeois intellectuals must be thoroughly transformed. The first Five-Year Plan of our national economy has been completed and overfulfilled, and the second Five-Year Plan has begun. After the national economic plan for 1958 is discussed and approved by the conference, it will be implemented. The Central Committee of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are calling on us to "go all out and aim high." Most intellectuals should embrace revolutionary optimism, adhere to revolutionary struggle, especially adhere to the revolutionary struggle aimed at themselves, and be determined to revolutionize themselves. In this way, anyone can be transformed, and anyone can pass the socialist test well. We have Marxism-Leninism as our guiding ideology, we have the Communist Party of China as our leadership core, and we have Chairman Mao constantly giving us new enlightenment, new impetus, and new action programs under the new historical conditions. We are proud of this. We are doing things that many people previously thought could not be done, doing things that many people previously thought were impossible. In a word, we are doing a glorious and great cause that our predecessors have not done. In this bright spring, with myriad phenomena, with three years looking like five, and the first year looking like three in the great leap forward of the production of material and spiritual wealth, our noble inner passion cannot help but reproduce the process of the liberation of the working people and the improvement of the material and spiritual living standards as a true epic process containing the entire era. And we want to express it through happy, hopeful lyricism, and sing the great song of the great unity and great joy of the 600 million people:

　　Three years look like five, the first year looks like three;
　　Go all out and welcome the good spring.
　　The great leap forward in production, set the pace for transformation;
　　The most important thing is position, and also the worldview.
　　Eliminate arrogance, sweep away pessimism;
　　In socialism, I am also the master.
　　The Party and Chairman Mao lead us straight ahead;
　　If you fall behind one step, you will fall into the abyss.
　　Rectify and reform yourself, determined not to fear difficulties;
　　Try hard to rush up, lower your head to pass the test.
　　Spring light shines on the earth, everyone is happy;
　　Sing of Chairman Mao, may he live ten thousand years.

### 我要歌唱  邓初民代表谈整风和反右派斗争后的知识分子状况

　　我要歌唱
    邓初民代表谈整风和反右派斗争后的知识分子状况
    我走到这个庄严肃穆的大会讲坛上来，不是想要来发言，而是想要来歌唱的。歌唱全民整风运动和反右派斗争所鼓舞起来的六亿人民的革命干劲和表现在各方面的生气蓬勃的新跃进和新气象。可惜我不是一只善于歌唱的“山胡鸟”，不能像诗人苏东坡所描写的那样：“谁知声??（音会会），亦自意重重”。
    打开报纸一看，特别是听了各位代表从农村、工厂、山区、平原所带来的种种令人心花怒放的喜讯，要歌唱的实在太多了。只随便说几件新人、新事，试问那一样不是“颂歌”、“史诗”般的美呢？那一样不值得我们来歌唱呢？唱是唱不完的啊！我究竟不是什么歌手，还是放老实些吧！唱不完的美丽动人的歌谱、诗篇，最好让今天在座的人大代表白杨、郭兰英、田华、王昆、常香玉、郎咸芬、陈书舫那些真正的歌手们去唱吧！这里我仅谈谈全民整风运动和反右派斗争后知识分子的情况。
    知识分子应该认清自己的阶级属性，决心放下架子，参加劳动锻炼，彻底改造自己，这是在思想上政治上从旧阶段到新阶段的大跃进
    一九五七年，特别是一九五七年下半年，在某些知识分子中是一阵阵的狂风暴雨。“月白风清，如此良夜何”！这是过去一般知识分子所最喜爱的风雅。早春天气，乍暖还寒，他们尚且觉得难于将息，在狂风暴雨之中，就不免叫他们胆战心惊起来了，这是知识分子右派。我们同右派进行了一场尖锐而激烈的政治战线上和思想战线上两条道路的斗争，右派被粉碎了，我们胜利了，这是党和人民的力量，这是历史的必然性。
    在整风运动和反右派斗争中，广大知识分子参加了这一战斗，我们立刻看到正气上升，邪气下降。有许多知识分子决心放下架子，改造自己，申请下乡上山，参加生产劳动，过好社会主义这一关。这是知识分子对准自己本身的大革命，也是知识分子在思想上、政治上从旧阶段到新阶段的大跃进。无怪谢老（觉哉）“元旦致下放干部信”也情不自禁地要写歌一首，来歌唱这种令人兴奋鼓舞的情况。他写道：
    谁嗟行路难，下乡又上山。乡是宝玉乡，
    山是锦绣山。劳动造一切，花样有千般。
    播、莳、犁、耙、割，才有盘中餐。
    工人勤又巧，才有百货单。躬身去劳动，
    才知甜酸咸。基层工作者，知识数不完。
    书本上所学，渺小不足谈。人家欢迎你，
    你也不是玩。体力与脑力，锻炼成一丸。
    “无”兴“资”全灭，从根除敌顽。他的名字是：过社会主义的关。
    这对于知识分子是一种教导，一种鼓舞，也是一种真实的描写。这是知识分子左派。他们为广大中间知识分子树立了榜样，这难道说不值得歌唱吗？让我们同谢老一齐来歌唱吧！
    以上是一种情况。另一种情况，则是广大知识分子在整风和反右派斗争以后，在各方面都有所提高，特别是对于整个知识界和知识分子自己本身的认识有所提高。整个知识界的政治立场和思想意识究竟怎样？它的阶级属性和世界观究竟怎样？是工人阶级知识分子，还是资产阶级知识分子？是工人阶级的世界观，还是资产阶级的世界观？这在反右派斗争之前，是模糊不清的。一般是把整个知识界和自己都估计得过高的。“无产阶级的小知识分子不能领导小资产阶级的大知识分子”（右派分子罗隆基）。“我所读的马列主义的书，不见得比你们党的理论家读得少些”（右派分子章乃器）。如此种种，举不胜举。试看他们的知识尾巴该是翘得多么高呵！在这种情况下，知识分子就是知识分子，是没有什么左、中、右之分的，都是“老子天下第一”，都是“内行”。一九五六年一月，周恩来总理曾经作了“关于知识分子问题的报告”，为我们如实地指出：在我们的企业、学校、机关里、社会上，都还有具有种种错误观点和抱有种种错误态度的知识分子。例如他们不分敌我；留恋资本主义，甚至留恋封建主义；反对苏联，拒绝学习马克思列宁主义，甚至诋毁马克思列宁主义；轻视劳动，轻视劳动人民；不但常常在知识分子和党之间制造纠纷和对立，而且也在知识分子中间制造纠纷和对立；妄自尊大，以为天下第一；否认人民的利益、社会的利益，看一切问题都从个人的利益出发，合乎自己利益的就赞成，不合乎自己利益的就反对。周总理紧接着说：“所有这些错误一应俱全的人，在现在的知识分子中是很少数；但是有上述一种或者几种错误的人，就不是很少数。不但落后分子，就是一部分中间分子，也常有以上所说的某一些错误观点。胸怀窄狭，高傲自大；看问题从个人的利益出发的毛病，在进步分子中也还不少”。
    周总理所指出的具有种种错误观点和抱有种种错误态度的知识分子，基本上都是资产阶级知识分子。其中落后、进步、中间的区分，亦即大体上左、中、右的政治分野，也是早已客观存在的事实。可是那时大多数知识分子是不认识这些的，同时，他们也不管这些。整风和反右，首先教育了广大知识分子，认识到知识界的资产阶级性，认识到自己本身的资产阶级性，认识到资产阶级知识分子的两面性，同时，也认识到资产阶级知识分子左、中、右政治分野的客观存在和资产阶级知识分子必须改造的重要性。从而也提高了政治思想水平，辨明了政治上的大是大非，特别是在带有关键性的问题上，认识到必须接受党的领导和走社会主义道路。可是过去在这一带关键性的问题上，也是认识不够的。惯于耍两面手法的右派不必说了，就是大多数中间派，对于接受党的领导和走社会主义道路，也只有抽象的认识，一遇到具体问题，就正如周总理所说：“合乎自己利益的就赞成，不合乎自己利益的就反对”。整风和反右，孤立了右派，教育了大多数中间派，同时也提高了左派。从而使知识界有可能形成一支宏大的工人阶级知识分子队伍，来为社会主义建设各方面的大跃进服务，同时也是知识分子本身的一个大跃进。
    整风和反右，给我们带来了无穷无尽的力量，使我们在各个战线上——经济战线上、政治战线上、思想战线上的社会主义革命，都打了胜仗。此后特别要在对准知识分子自己的革命中，打一个更大的胜仗。
    春天来了，这又是一个不平凡的春天，鸟语花香，万象更新。在这大好的时光里，已经觉醒了的民族，已经觉醒了的知识分子（尽管基本上还是资产阶级的知识分子），只要决心改造，前进的步伐是没有任何力量阻挡得住的。最怕的是对自己的阶级属性认识不清，过高的估计自己。
    经过整风和反右派斗争后，大多数知识分子，是对自己有了一定认识的，但还是有不少糊涂思想。例如有人对于资产阶级知识分子的提法，在思想上搞不通。他们说，过去一般是把知识分子叫作小资产阶级知识分子，经过了五大运动，三大改造，为什么反而“升级”为资产阶级知识分子了呢？又说，知识分子一不占有工厂，二不占有土地，资产阶级这一称号从何而来呢？这显然都只是从形式上看问题，没有触及知识分子的阶级立场和阶级本质。形式主义哲学，压根儿就是资产阶级哲学，既然他们还怀疑资产阶级知识分子的提法，同时就必然要怀疑到资产阶级知识分子的两面性，特别对于知识分子参加生产劳动来进行改造，更加怀疑。有人说，列宁认为科学家和工程师的改造，是要循着自己的途径来承认共产主义思想的，为什么要提倡知识分子参加生产劳动锻炼呢？有人认为，知识分子改造的关键在于自己努力，参加劳动生产并不重要；有人还说，农民劳动了几千年，思想还落后，经过了多年锻炼的老干部，有的还是犯错误。参加生产劳动有什么好处？就算有好处，也只能解决“红”的问题，不能解决“专”的问题；甚至有人说，要科学家参加生产劳动，是把“钢材”当作“木材”用。这些问题不可能在这里一一解答。殊不知社会存在的主要条件就是劳动，就是生产；整个历史的发展，都是劳动人民劳动生产的结果；劳动不仅创造了世界，还创造了人本身。所以毛主席教导我们说：“人类的生产活动，是最基本的实践活动，是决定其他一切活动的东西。”参加生产劳动，现在已是一种重要的革命措施，同时是使知识分子不脱离实际，不脱离群众，把脑力劳动与体力劳动辩证的统一起来的移风易俗之举！
    知识分子既不要自大也不要自卑，不应该要就乱说，要就不说，要就乱动，要就不动，而要有主人翁的感觉，习惯运用大鸣大争的民主方式，鼓起旺盛意志，作革命的促进派
    知识分子的特点，不是自高自大，就是自卑（但主导的方面是自高自大）。经过反右派斗争，大多数知识分子的自高自大气，是反掉了一些，但不免又增加了某些人的自卑感（实际上是从不服气中产生出来的自卑感）。纵然他再不公开地把党比作婆婆，把自己比作媳妇，但总是没有主人翁的感觉，他把人民和他，或者党和他的关系，总是看作主客关系。他在人民的面前或在党的面前，总觉得不合套，不自然，他在宏伟壮丽的社会主义大厦里，总不感到他是这个大厦的主人之一。没有主人翁的感觉，就不能把个人的命运和劳动人民的命运、大有希望的民族命运、伟大的共产主义事业联系在一起。在社会主义制度下，看不见人民群众对社会发展的日益增长的积极作用，看不见自己真正做主人的历史作用，鼓不起旺盛的革命意志，不能要求自己做一个革命的促进派。这对于每一个知识分子的进步来说，都是很危险的。因此我们一定要肯定自己在各种生活中的主要地位，只有社会主义社会才第一次表现出每一个人都不是需要感伤和怜悯的对象，而是生活的真正主人翁和创造者，都是自己命运的掌握者。知识分子只有从这种态度出发，才能明确的和高瞻远瞩的看到时代在前进，自己也和时代一起在前进。从而把自己和工人阶级、和党的关系，看做只有领导与被领导的关系，没有主客的关系，自然也没有地位不平等的关系，看做只有在政治上、精神上日趋一致，日趋统一的关系，没有日趋纠纷、彼此对立的关系。大家是一直统一在温暖的社会主义大家庭里，虽然这仍是某种矛盾的统一，但人民内部的矛盾，始终是社会主义新阶段与社会主义新人不断向前跃进的前提。所以自卑、自谦、消极、悲观，都是没有任何根据的。
    然而在少数知识分子中，少数特别是在政治地位社会地位都很高和较高的知识分子中却还存在着某种自卑感和消极、悲观论调，不敢或不愿以主人翁自居，这是值得注意的一种情况。
    这种情况，特别反映在对于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针的认识上。尽管右派借鸣放来向党、向人民、向社会主义猖狂进攻，但是鸣放的方针，却一值在坚持着，此后还要坚持一千年、一万年。因为这是正确处理人民内部矛盾的重要方法之一，也是繁荣科学、艺术的重要方法之一。党和政府不仅在学术思想界坚持这一方针，而且在整风和反右派斗争中，还把它适用于广大劳动人民。广大劳动人民不仅学会了用大鸣大放、大争大辩、贴大字报一套方法，改进了工作，掀起了高潮，正确处理了人民内部矛盾，而且采用这套方法取得了处理人民同资产阶级右派这一敌我矛盾的经验。然而在反右胜利后的某些知识分子，现在却反而消极了，很少鸣放，亦少争辩。鸣放辩论，不仅在政策上是处理人民内部矛盾和繁荣科学、艺术的方法、方针，而且在实践中成为社会主义民主最广泛、最深刻、最生动活泼的民主方式。广大劳动人民都会利用和喜爱这种民主方式，正在扩大这种民主方式。而某些经常感到社会主义民主不够的知识分子，却反而对它很冷淡，不敢或不愿利用这种民主方式。要就乱说，要就不说，要就乱动，要就不动。这更是值得注意的一种情况。
    在目前的整改阶段中，知识分子主要是整改自己的立场和世界观，也就是要树立工人阶级的立场和工人阶级世界观。中间状态的知识分子应成为整改的主要对象。左派也应该继续改造和提高。
    以上简单地反映了整风运动和反右派斗争后的知识分子的某些情况。但这是很不够的，因为处于中间状态的知识分子，外表与内心活动，都是异常复杂的。整风所鼓舞起来的社会主义干劲，将要长期地起作用。现在整风正转入第三阶段——整改阶段，对于知识分子来说，就是对准自己来整改，主要是整改立场。立场是人们用来观察和处理社会上一切问题的根本出发点。要就是工人阶级立场，要就是资产阶级立场，中间立场是没有的。知识分子，就必须在政治上具有坚定不移的接受党的领导，走社会主义道路的工人阶级立场。同时，是整改世界观。世界观是人们对于世界的总的看法和态度，是人们对于自然界和社会进行观察、分析以至于解决问题时所采取的观点、方法和所根据的理论体系。要就是工人阶级的世界观，要就是资产阶级的世界观，中间的世界观，中立的哲学是没有的。知识分子，就必须在思想体系上以马克思列宁主义武装自己，以马克思列宁主义的哲学亦即工人阶级的世界观，作为自己的世界观。
    政治上中间派的立场和思想上的哲学中立主义，实质上都会要在某种情况下助长右派的声势。所以立场和世界观问题，实质上就是阶级性和党性原则问题。许多知识分子，把阶级性和党性原则同科学性和人性（或个性）对立起来，而硬说马克思列宁主义充满了宣传功利主义的片面性，把阶级性和党性原则同科学性和人性（或个性）之间的关系，说成是一种永远不能克服的悲剧性的矛盾，从而把要求对于知识分子的阶级立场的改造和看问题时党性原则的坚持，看作是党和政府向知识界发出的一些政治指示、戒律、命令，而不乐于接受。这是极为严重的错误观点，也是在知识分子中颇具代表性的观点。尤其是把体现劳动人民的根本利益和思想感情，充满着社会主义大家庭的温暖和鼓舞人心巨大希望的马克思列宁主义，看作资产阶级功利主义的错误观点，更使人不能容忍。这种错误观点或错误思想，都是极为丑恶的资产阶级本质的具体表现。所以“党始终坚持：资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子必须彻底改造”。（邓小平副总理）
    处于中间状态的知识分子是大多数，他们应该成为改造或整改的主要对象。但左派也要继续改造和提高。右派也“会有一部分转过来重新接受改造，这是可能的，也是我们所希望的，我们并不希望右派分子走绝路。”（李维汉部长）
    这就是说所有资产阶级知识分子都必须彻底改造。我国国民经济的第一个五年计划已经完成和超额完成，第二个五年计划已经开始，一九五八年度的国民经济计划，经过大会讨论通过以后，就要付诸执行，共产党中央和毛主席正号召我们“鼓足干劲，力争上游”。大多数知识分子，应该抱着革命的乐观主义，坚持革命的斗争，特别是坚持对准自己本身的革命斗争，决心革自己的命。这样，任何人都是可能得到改造的，任何人都是可能过好社会主义这一关的。我们有马克思列宁主义作为指导思想，我们有中国共产党作为领导核心，我们有毛主席在新的历史条件下不断给我们以新的启示、新的动力、新的行动纲领。我们以此感到自豪。我们正在做从前许多人认为做不到的事情，做从前许多人看来是不可能的事情，一句话，我们正在做我们前人所没有做过的光荣伟大的事业。在这春光明媚，气象万千，五年看三年，三年看头年的物质和精神财富的生产大跃进中，我们崇高的内心激情，禁不住要把劳动人民的解放和物质精神生活水平提高的过程，再现为包含着整个时代的真实的史诗性质的过程，并要通过兴高彩烈、大有希望的抒情，发出六亿人民大团结，大欢乐的大歌唱：
    五年看三年，三年看头年；
    鼓起干劲来，迎接好春天。
    生产大跃进，改造着先鞭；
    首要是立场，还有世界观。
    打掉自大气，扫除悲观论；
    社会主义里，我也是主人。
    党与毛主席，领导直向前；
    一步跟不上，就要堕深渊。
    整改到自己，决心不怕难；
    使劲冲上去，低头好过关。
    春光照大地，人人尽欢颜；
    歌唱毛主席，长寿万万年。
