    What Was the Necessity?

    Dulles's crudely interfering speech in Indonesia's internal affairs has aroused the justifiable indignation of the Indonesian people. But the Washington authorities show no sign of repentance. Officials of the US State Department even insisted, "What Mr. Dulles said was necessary, because there is no benefit in pretending that the United States approves of everything that is happening in Indonesia."

    If Dulles's remarks attacking the Indonesian government were, as this official said, merely intended to clarify the US attitude, then it would indeed be completely unnecessary, because what the United States hates and approves of regarding what is happening in Indonesia is no secret.

    In fact, the purpose of Dulles's speech was not this; he wanted to openly interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. Thus, from Washington's point of view, what Dulles said was necessary.

    有何必要
    杜勒斯发表的粗暴干涉印度尼西亚内政的谈话已引起印度尼西亚人民理所当然的愤慨。但是华盛顿当局毫无悔过之意。美国国务院的官员居然还坚持说：“杜勒斯先生所讲的话都是有必要讲的，因为假装美国以赞许态度对待印度尼西亚发生的一切事情是没有好处的。”
    如果杜勒斯发表攻击印度尼西亚政府的言论，其用意真如这个官员所说的，只是为了澄清美国的态度，那才真是毫无必要的，因为对于在印度尼西亚国内发生的事情，美国仇视什么，赞许什么，已经不是什么秘密。
    事实上，杜勒斯谈话的目的并不在此，他是要公开干涉印度尼西亚的内政。这样，杜勒斯所讲的话，从华盛顿方面看来，就是有必要讲的了。
