“A Legend of Love” and “Labakan”
Two Films Co-produced by Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia

Recently, two new films co-produced by Bulgarian and Czechoslovakian filmmakers, "A Legend of Love" and "Labakan," appeared on screens across Bulgaria.

The first film is based on the famous long poem "A Legend of Love" by the Turkish poet Hikmet. The film tells the story of the beautiful Shirin's love for the talented painter Farhad. Shirin's sister, the stern female leader of Alsin City, obstructs the lovers' relationship. The residents of Alsin City are dying in large numbers due to water shortages. Farhad's faithful lover helps him conquer the "Iron Mountain" and bring water to the residents of Alsin City.

The second film, "Labakan," is based on Wilhelm Hauff's story "The Little Mook." This film satirizes Labakan, a tailor who loves to boast but lacks skill. He feels ashamed of being a commoner, so he avoids his colleagues. Later, he steals the real prince's dagger and clothes and proclaims himself a famous high-ranking official. However, the deception is exposed, people reveal Labakan's true identity, his lover Fakime and good friend Ali leave him, and wherever he goes, people laugh at him... But, fortunately, it was all a dream! The exterior shots were filmed in the beautiful Bulgarian ancient cities of Plovdiv, Balchik, Sozopol, and near Sliven. The remaining shots were filmed in the studios of the "Barrandov Film Studios" in Czechoslovakia. (Attached pictures)

    “爱情的传说”和“拉巴干”
    保捷两国合拍的两部影片
    不久前，保加利亚各地银幕上出现了保加利亚和捷克斯洛伐克两国电影工作者合作拍摄的两部新影片：“爱情的传说”和“拉巴干”。
    第一部影片是根据土耳其诗人希克梅特的著名长诗“爱情的传说”改编的。影片叙述美女什林对天才画家法尔哈德的爱情的故事。什林的姐姐，严厉的阿尔辛城的女领主，却阻挠这一对恋人相爱。阿尔辛城的居民因缺水而大批死去。法尔哈德的忠贞的爱人帮助了他战胜“铁山”，把水送给阿尔辛城的居民。
    第二部影片“拉巴干”是根据维利根利姆·加乌夫的故事“裁缝王子”改编拍摄的。这部电影讽刺了喜爱吹嘘而手艺不高的裁缝拉巴干。他因自己是平民而感到耻辱，于是他躲避自己的同事们。后来，他偷了真正王子的短剑和衣服，并宣称自己是著名的高官。但是，欺骗被揭穿了，人们揭露了拉巴干，他的情人法其麦和好朋友阿里都离开了他，他到哪里，哪里的人们都嘲笑他……可是，还好，这一切都是一场梦！外景是在风景美丽的保加利亚古城：普罗夫迪夫、巴尔契克、?赛泊尔和斯利文市近郊等地拍摄的。其余的镜头是在捷克斯洛伐克“巴兰多夫电影制片厂”摄影棚内拍摄的。（附图片）
