Xinhua News Agency, Huangyan, February 25th: The Southern Double-Wheel Double-Share Plow Modification Appraisal and Promotion Experience Exchange Meeting opened in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, on the 24th.

This meeting was convened by the Ministry of Agriculture. Participating in the meeting were responsible cadres of agricultural departments from fourteen provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, and Shanghai, representatives of typical counties and agricultural cooperatives, as well as representatives from the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute, and relevant central departments, totaling more than eighty people. More than one hundred and thirty commissioners and county heads who participated in the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Implement Conference held simultaneously in Huangyan also attended the meeting as observers.

The main contents of the meeting are two: one is to exchange and summarize the experience of promoting and modifying the double-wheel double-share plow in the southern paddy field areas, break right-leaning conservative ideas, and further promote the promotion work to support the great leap forward in agricultural production. The other is to understand what new types of agricultural implements are suitable for use in various southern provinces and to exchange some opinions on how to carry out the initial reform of production tools to transition to mechanized production.

The meeting will adopt a method of combining in-depth on-site visits and free-airing discussions. On the first day of the meeting, group discussions have already been launched on the issues of whether double-wheel double-share plows can be used in paddy field areas and what experiences and lessons have been learned. Later, they will visit Jiaokeng Township in Huangyan County to observe plowman technical performances and conduct on-site experiments on several modified double-wheel double-share plows.

The promotion of double-wheel double (single) share plows began in Northeast China in 1950. In 1953, it was introduced to Guannei (area south of Shanhaiguan Pass), and in 1954 and 1955, key trials and typical demonstrations were conducted in the southern paddy field areas. With the advent of the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, a large number of promotions were carried out in early 1956. By last year, a total of more than 1.62 million plows had been promoted nationwide, of which more than 274,000 were in the southern paddy field areas. Due to the lack of experience among farmers in using double-wheel double-share plows in paddy fields, some technical problems were generally encountered at the beginning, such as difficulties in making ridges, large areas left uncultivated on the edges of the fields, and difficulties such as "one cow can't pull it, and two cows will fight," and difficulties were also felt in cultivating fields with deep mud feet and fields with two or three plowings. Based on this, some people with conservative ideas believed that double-wheel double-share plows could not be used in paddy field areas. However, facts have proved that it is not that they cannot be used, but rather that people's right-leaning conservative ideas are at play. As long as the leadership exerts sufficient revolutionary energy and unswervingly relies on the masses to delve into research, some technical problems that arise in the early stages of promotion can be completely solved. The fact that Huangyan County has continuously increased the promotion and regular use of double-share plows since 1956 and has achieved significant increases in production is one such vivid and clear example. The holding of this meeting in Huangyan is to enlighten and educate people on the spot. In addition, the problem of plowing muddy fields with mud feet deeper than one foot and fields with two or three plowings can also be completely solved by modifying some parts (such as replacing iron wheels with wooden wheels, adding plowshare covers, and auxiliary plowboards). Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces have created modification experiences. This meeting will evaluate several modified double-share plows, make technical appraisals, and provide reference for modification in various places.

### 南方各省市代表齐集黄岩现场  交流水田使用双轮双铧犁经验

    南方各省市代表齐集黄岩现场
    交流水田使用双轮双铧犁经验
    新华社黄岩25日电　南方双轮双铧犁改装评比和推广使用经验交流会24日在浙江省黄岩县开幕。
    这个会议是由农业部召开的。参加会议的有浙江、福建、广东、广西、贵州、四川、云南、湖北、湖南、江西、安徽、江苏、河南和上海等十四个省、市的农业部门主管农具的负责干部、典型县和农业社的代表以及中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所、南京农业机械化研究所和中央有关部门的代表等共计八十多人。参加在黄岩同时举行的浙江省农具会议的专员、县长等一百三十多人，也全部列席了这个会议。
    会议的内容主要有两项。一项是交流、总结南方水田地区推广使用和改装双轮双铧犁的经验，打破右倾保守思想，进一步地推动推广工作，以支持农业生产大跃进。另一项是了解南方各省使用什么新式农具合适，并且就怎样进行生产工具的初步改革从而过渡到机械化生产的问题交换一些意见。
    会议将采用深入现场参观访问和鸣放讨论相结合的办法进行。会议第一天，已经就水田地区能不能使用双轮双铧犁、有些什么经验教训等问题，分组展开了大鸣大放。以后将到黄岩县焦坑乡参观犁手技术表演和实地试验几种改装的双轮双铧犁。
    双轮双（单）铧犁的推广工作是1950年先在东北地区开始的，1953年引进了关内，1954年和1955年在南方水田地区做了重点试验和典型示范。随着农业合作化运动高潮的出现，1956年初进行了大量推广，到去年全国共推广了一百六十二万多部，其中有二十七万四千多部在南方水田地区。由于农民缺乏在水田中使用双轮双铧犁的经验，开始时一般都遇到了一些技术上的问题，如像不好作畦、田边田角留的大、小块田不好耕和“一头牛拉不动，两头牛要打架”等困难，泥脚深的田和二翻三翻田也感到不好耕。据此，一些有保守思想的人便认为水田地区不能使用双轮双铧犁。但是，事实证明，并不是不能使用，而是人们的右倾保守思想作怪。只要领导上鼓足革命干劲，坚定不移地依靠群众深入钻研，在推广初期产生的一些使用技术上的问题是完全可以解决的。黄岩县从1956年以来推广和经常使用的双铧犁连年增加并且获得显著增产的事实，就是这样的生动鲜明的例证之一。这次会议在黄岩举行，就是让人们在现场受到启示和教育。另外，翻耕泥脚深在一尺以内的烂泥田和二翻三翻田的问题，经过改装部分部件（如将铁轮换成木轮、加犁头套和辅助犁壁等）也完全可以解决。浙江、广东、湖北、安徽等省都创造了改装经验，这次会议将评比几种改装的双铧犁，做出技术鉴定，供各地改装参考。
