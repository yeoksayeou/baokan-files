    Seven Thousand Big-Character Posters are Seventy Thousand Weapons
    Ministry of Foreign Trade Besieges Waste and Vigorously Attacks Conservatism
    Experience Proves: Government Work Should Also Launch a Heatwave of Learning From, Comparing With, and Catching Up With the Advanced

    (Our Newspaper's Report) The Ministry of Foreign Trade's anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign has set off an unprecedented upsurge. As of February 15th, all thirty-four units had posted more than 70,000 big-character posters, more than double the total number of big-character posters since the rectification movement. Out of more than 4,000 staff members, each person posted an average of more than seventeen big-character posters. Currently, the broad masses are exerting their revolutionary energy and are besieging waste from all directions. Anti-waste, anti-conservatism, comparison with the advanced, comparison of enthusiasm, and the realization of a great leap forward in thinking and work have become the masses' battle cry and action goal.
    The main target of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism big-character posters is the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leadership and the irresponsible young master style of some people. For example, big-character posters revealed that in 1954, a company under the Ministry of Foreign Trade supplied 4,115,000 meters of cotton cloth to foreign countries. The person in charge mistook "meters" for "yards," and the leadership at all levels did not discover this during the approval process. As a result, a difference of one word resulted in an undercalculation of 342,400 meters of cloth, resulting in a loss of 348,000 yuan in RMB. The big-character posters also revealed a large number of bourgeois ideological styles of extravagance and showing off wealth. For example, one delegation going abroad, in order to show "generosity," brought 115 boxes of wine and 35 boxes of canned goods. Unable to finish it themselves, they gave it to other delegations. This delegation of eight people spent a total of 46,000 yuan during their forty-two days abroad. Many leading cadres also posted big-character posters to expose themselves.
    The Ministry of Foreign Trade has focused on several major issues in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism struggle:
    The first issue is to make all cadres ideologically clear that this anti-waste campaign is not only an economic struggle, but more importantly, a political and ideological struggle, that is, to break capitalist ideology, establish socialist ideology, and implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, and building the country through diligence and thrift. When the Ministry of Foreign Trade carried out the anti-waste mobilization at the beginning of February, because the political significance of this anti-waste movement was not emphasized enough, many ideological problems were not completely resolved. Some leading cadres believed that "business has already been decentralized, there is nothing to oppose"; administrative cadres believed that "they are neither in charge of money nor business, there is not much profit to be made"; and some people even thought that "waste has been opposed every year, it is just the same thing." Therefore, three or four days after the mobilization meeting, many units lacked enthusiasm, and the big-character posters were sparse, not even ten or so. In response to this situation, the Party Group of the Ministry of Foreign Trade held a series of small meetings to solve ideological problems, and in view of the specific ideological conditions of cadres in various aspects, helped them calculate detailed accounts, find materials, and explained that it was not that there was no waste to oppose, but that there were many things to oppose. In addition, a meeting of cadres above the level of division chiefs was held to make further mobilization, focusing on the fact that this anti-waste campaign is not just about calculating how much money has been lost (this is necessary), but more importantly, to overthrow official airs, sluggishness, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness, and to arouse revolutionary energy, to achieve a great leap forward in thinking and a great leap forward in work. That is, to make cadres understand what kind of thinking to use to build socialism. Should we use the thinking and methods of building the country diligently and thriftily with more, faster, better, and more economical results, or should we use the thinking and methods of extravagance and waste to build socialism? Therefore, this anti-waste struggle is related to whether we can build socialism faster. In addition, at this meeting, leading cadres were also called upon to take the lead in airing their views freely. After the meeting, all units immediately held meetings to carry out in-depth ideological mobilization. The atmosphere was different that afternoon, and everyone scrambled to post big-character posters. One company posted more than 700 in one afternoon. The next day was Sunday, but few people rested. By the fourth day, there were already more than 17,000 big-character posters, almost three times more than the original number.
    Secondly, responsible cadres must personally lead the movement. The Minister and Vice-Ministers, and the Party Committee Secretary of this Ministry all personally went to the departments, bureaus, and companies to specifically deploy and inspect the situation of the anti-waste movement, and solve problems wherever they occurred. For example, Minister Ye Jizhuang went to the Planning Bureau to inspect work, patiently and meticulously helped the bureau criticize the wrong idea that "administrative departments have little profit to be made, and there is nothing to oppose," so that the movement was carried out smoothly.
    In addition to personally leading the movement, leading cadres must also personally participate in the movement. Vice-Minister Li Zheren and Assistant Minister Bai Xiangyin took the lead in posting big-character posters, exposing the serious waste of the delegation going abroad. Almost every cadre at the division, bureau, and section chief level wrote big-character posters. One section chief of the China Tea Export Company wrote twenty-six.
    Finally, the Ministry of Foreign Trade adopted a relatively good working method in this anti-waste campaign. This is: find the advanced, grasp the advanced, compare with the advanced, and catch up with the advanced. Not long after the anti-waste movement began, they found that the Animal Products Company was doing a very good job, and the Ministry's rectification leading group immediately organized members of the rectification leading groups of other units and Party members, League members, and activists to visit and evaluate the Animal Products Company and held on-site meetings on the spot. The responsible comrades of the Animal Products Company introduced on the spot the experience of how to set off a high tide of anti-waste in busy business work. They used vivid and specific examples to powerfully illustrate that heavy business work does not hinder the development of the anti-waste movement, but instead complements each other. The twenty-six people at home in the purchasing department of this company received and contacted forty-five people and drafted and issued forty documents, received one hundred and seven documents, drafted an important report to the higher authorities comparing the planned prices and actual prices of thirteen kinds of commodities in the domestic market, and wrote more than 400 anti-waste big-character posters in five days. After such visits, evaluations, and listening to reports, many units that originally thought they were "almost there" felt that they were "too far behind." Many units that were originally worried that business work was busy and the movement would not be easy to carry out also dispelled their worries, strengthened their confidence, and put forward the revolutionary slogan of "exerting full energy and learning from the Animal Products Company." Members of the rectification leading group of the Minerals Company originally thought that their company had posted 390 big-character posters in just four days, exposing 361 cases of waste, so how could they say that their enthusiasm was small? But after visiting and listening to the report, they felt that their enthusiasm was still not enough. After returning to the company, they immediately held an emergency meeting, criticized conservative complacency, put forward the action slogan of "learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced," and studied specific measures for airing their views freely. On the 11th alone, the number of big-character posters increased from more than 400 to 1,699, and now there are more than 4,000.

### 七万张大字报是七万件武器  外贸部围剿浪费猛攻保守  经验证明：机关工作也应该掀起学先进比先进赶先进的热潮

    七万张大字报是七万件武器
    外贸部围剿浪费猛攻保守
    经验证明：机关工作也应该掀起学先进比先进赶先进的热潮
    本报讯　对外贸易部的反浪费反保守运动掀起了空前未有的高潮。截至2月15日止，全部三十四个单位已经贴出大字报七万多张。比整风运动以来大字报的总数多一倍以上。全部四千多工作人员，平均每人贴大字报十七张以上。目前广大群众鼓足了革命干劲，正从四面八方围剿浪费。反浪费，反保守，比先进，比干劲，实现思想大跃进和工作大跃进，已经成为群众的战斗口号和行动目标。
    反浪费、反保守大字报的主要矛头，针对着领导上的官僚主义、主观主义和部分人不负责任的大少爷作风。例如大字报揭发：1954年外贸部所属一个公司供应国外棉布四百十一点五万公尺，经办人把
  “公尺”误为“码”，领导上层层审批时也没有发现。结果，一字之差，就少算了三十四万二千四百公尺布，损失人民币三十四万八千元。大字报还揭发了大量讲排场、比阔气的资产阶级思想作风。例如有一个出国代表团，为了表示“大方”，带了一百十五箱酒和三十五箱罐头，自己吃不完，就送给别的代表团。这个代表团八个人，那次在国外四十二天，一共花了四万六千元。许多领导干部，也贴大字报引火烧身进行自我揭发。
    对外贸易部对反浪费反保守斗争抓紧了几个主要问题：
    首先一个问题是：使全体干部从思想上明确这次反浪费不只是一场经济上的斗争，更重要的是政治上、思想上的斗争，即破资本主义思想，立社会主义思想，贯彻多、快、好、省，勤俭建国方针的斗争。对外贸易部2月初在进行反浪费动员时，由于对这次反浪费运动的政治意义强调不够，好些思想问题没有完全解决。有的领导干部认为“业务已经下放了，没有什么可反”；行政干部认为“自己既不管钱，也不管业务，油水不大”；甚至还有人认为“年年反浪费，还不就是那么回事”。因此，动员大会以后三、四天，许多单位劲头不足，大字报稀稀拉拉，不上十来张。根据这一情况，对外贸易部党组召开一系列的小型会议解决思想问题，针对各方面干部的具体思想情况，帮助他们算细账，找材料，说明不是没有浪费可反，而是可反的东西很多。另外，又召开了处长以上的干部会议，作了进一步的动员，着重说明：这次反浪费不只是算一算损失了几个钱（这是必要的），更重要的是要打倒官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气，鼓起革命干劲，实现思想上大跃进和工作上大跃进。也就是要使干部懂得用什么思想来建设社会主义。用多快好省的勤俭建国的思想和方法建设社会主义呢？还是用铺张浪费的思想和方法来建设社会主义？因此，这场反浪费斗争关系到能不能更快地建设社会主义的问题。另外，在这个会上，还号召领导干部带头鸣放。会后，各单位立即召开了会议，进行深入的思想动员。当天下午，气氛就不同了，个个争先恐后贴大字报。有一个公司一个下午，就贴了七百多张。第二天是礼拜天，但是很少有人休息，到第四天，大字报已有一万七千多张，比原来的数字增加将近三倍。
    其次，负责干部要亲自领导运动。这个部的正副部长、党委书记这次都亲自到司、局、公司，具体布置和检查反浪费运动的情况，那儿有问题就在那儿解决问题。如叶季壮部长到计划局检查工作，耐心地、细致地帮助这个局批判了“行政部门油水不大，没有什么东西可反”的错误思想，使运动顺利开展。
    领导干部除亲自领导运动以外，还必须亲自投入运动。李哲人副部长、白向银部长助理一马当先贴了大字报，揭发了出国代表团严重的浪费事实。司、局、处长级干部几乎每人都写了大字报，中国茶叶出口公司有一个处长写了二十六张。
    最后，对外贸易部在这次反浪费运动中，采取了一个比较好的工作方法。这就是：找先进、抓先进、比先进、赶先进。反浪费运动开始不久，他们发现畜产公司搞得很出色，部的整风领导小组就立即组织别单位的整风领导小组成员和党员、团员、积极分子到畜产公司参观、评比，就地召开现场会议。畜产公司负责同志当场介绍了怎样在繁忙的业务工作中掀起反浪费高潮的经验。他们以生动具体的事例，有力地说明了繁重的业务工作并不妨碍反浪费运动的展开，相反是相辅相成。这个公司收购处在家的二十六人，五天里接见和对外联系了四十五人次，起草发出四十个文件，收进一百零七个文件，草拟了向上级的一个十三种商品在国内市场上计划价格和实际价格比较的重要报告，写出了反浪费大字报四百多张。经过这样参观、评比、听报告以后，许多原来认为已经“差不多了”的单位感到自己“差得太多了”。许多原来顾虑业务工作忙，运动不容易开展的单位也打消了顾虑，增强了信心，纷纷提出了“鼓足干劲，向畜产公司看齐”的革命口号。矿产公司整风领导小组成员，原来认为他们公司在短短四天内贴出三百九十张大字报，揭发了三百六十一件浪费事实，还能说劲头小吗？可是在参观和听报告以后，就感到自己劲头还不足。回公司后，他们立即召开了紧急会议，批判了保守自满思想，提出了“学先进、比先进、赶先进”的行动口号，研究了大鸣大放的具体措施。11日一天之中，大字报就由原来的四百多张增加到一千六百九十九张，现在已经有四千多张。
