    A Sharp Contrast

    Good news has arrived from North Vietnam: The Vietnamese people's fight against drought has basically achieved victory, with 90% of the drought-stricken land receiving precious water, promising a good harvest. However, the Vietnamese people are not complacent and are also preparing to vigorously carry out well-drilling work, resolutely breaking the conventional pattern of "three good years, three bad years, and four average years" in the past decade, striving for continuous bumper harvests. This is a remarkable victory, the result of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the government leading the people of the North in arduous drought resistance, proving that "man will conquer nature."
    From South Vietnam comes news of severe disasters, impoverished people, and the continued exorbitant taxes and levies imposed by the Ngo Dinh Diem regime. South Vietnam, especially Cochinchina, is inherently a land of abundant resources, but due to natural disasters combined with man-made calamities, this rich land has suffered severe disasters.
    A single line separates the North and South, yet they have become two different worlds.

    鲜明的对比
    越南北方传来了捷报：越南人民的抗旱斗争基本上已经取得胜利，干旱土地的90％得到了宝贵的水，丰收在望。而越南人民并不以此自满，还准备大力开展打井工作，坚决打破历来十年中“三丰年，三歉年，四平年”的常规，争取连年丰收。这是一个了不起的胜利，这是胡志明主席、越南劳动党和政府领导着北部人民艰苦抗旱、“人定胜天”的结果。
    越南南方传来的却是灾情严重、民不聊生、吴庭艳政权仍在横征暴敛的消息。越南南部，特别是交趾支那，本是物产富庶的地方，但是天灾加上人祸，富庶之乡竟出现了严重灾情。
    南北一线之隔竟成两个世界。
