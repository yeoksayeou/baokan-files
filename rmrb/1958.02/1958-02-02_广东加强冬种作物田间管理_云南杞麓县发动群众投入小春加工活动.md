　　Guangdong Strengthens Field Management of Winter Crops
    Yunnan Qilu County Mobilizes Masses to Engage in Small Spring Processing Activities
    (Our newspaper reports) The phenomenon of some agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province neglecting field management of winter crops has been reversed. Farmers throughout the province are enthusiastically carrying out agricultural tasks such as hoeing, topdressing, earthing up, pest control, and drought resistance. In Guangdong, some cooperatives neglected winter crops while building water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer, resulting in failure to check and replant seedlings of beans and rape in time, slow progress in hoeing and topdressing, yellowing of sweet potato leaves, poor wheat development, and the growth of insect pests.
    After discovering this situation, local prefectural and county committees quickly organized the masses to conduct field inspections, observations, and comparisons, and carried out field management work. After inspecting more than 700 cooperatives in Dianbai County, it was found that 41,000 mu of crops were suffering from drought and 1,800 mu were affected by insect pests. Therefore, more than 70,000 people were immediately mobilized to pump water day and night to fight drought, saving more than 33,000 mu of crops and eliminating pests on 1,400 mu of land. Drought resistance and pest control are still continuing. Some cooperatives in Yangjiang County also adopted the method of field debates to criticize the capitalist thinking of upper-middle peasants who only fertilized vegetables and cash crops with higher incomes and were unwilling to fertilize food crops, and launched a sweet potato overproduction campaign.
    Currently, over 15 million mu of winter crops throughout the province are growing well after weeding and topdressing. Early planted sweet potatoes have begun to form tubers. (Li Shaoqiu)
    (Our newspaper reports) While vigorously building water conservancy projects, Qilu County, Yunnan, has also actively mobilized about 20% of the county's labor force to engage in small spring processing and drought-resistant seedling protection activities. Currently, more than 100,000 mu of small spring crops in Qilu County are facing severe drought and insect pest threats. The county party committee believes that while vigorously building water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer, small spring processing should not be neglected. It immediately organized debates among cadres and the masses to discuss whether a reduction in small spring production is good or bad, whether disasters can be overcome, what to do without water, and whether there is really a shortage of labor. After the debates, the masses in the Pucong Township agricultural cooperative immediately mobilized their enthusiasm for disaster resistance. Currently, Qilu County has dispatched more than 15,000 people to engage in small spring processing and disaster-resistant seedling protection activities, and a new upsurge in striving for increased small spring production is taking shape.

　　广东加强冬种作物田间管理
    云南杞麓县发动群众投入小春加工活动
    本报讯　广东省部分农业社忽视冬种作物田间管理的现象，已经扭转过来。全省各地农民热烈地开展了中耕、追肥、培土、除虫和抗旱等农活。广东各地在兴修水利和积肥运动中，有一些社对冬种作物缺乏照顾，致使豆类、油菜等没有及时查苗补苗，中耕追肥进度缓慢，出现了薯叶萎黄，麦子发育不良，虫害滋长的现象。
    各地委、县委发现这个情况后，迅速组织群众进行田间检查、观摩评比，开展田间管理工作。电白县有七百多个社经过检查后，发现了四万一千亩作物遭受干旱，有一千八百亩受到虫害，于是立即发动了七万多人不分日夜地车水抗旱，把三万三千多亩作物挽救过来，把一千四百亩地的害虫除净，现在还继续在抗旱除虫。阳江县有些社还采取田头大辩论的方式，批判上中农只顾在收益较多的蔬菜和经济作物中施肥，而不愿在粮食作物中施肥的资本主义思想，开展了蕃薯超额增产运动。
    现在全省有一千五百多万亩冬种作物，经过除草和追肥生长良好。早栽的蕃薯已开始结薯。（李少球）
    本报讯　云南杞麓县在大修水利的同时，又积极动员占全县20％左右的劳动力，投入小春加工和抗旱保苗活动。目前杞麓县有十万多亩小春受着严重的干旱和虫害威胁。县委认为在大力兴修水利和积肥的同时，不应忽视小春加工，立即在干部和群众中普遍组织了辩论，辩论小春减产好不好，能不能战胜灾害，没有水怎么办，劳动力真的不够吗等问题。普从乡农业社经过辩论后，群众抗灾的积极性立即发动起来了。现在，杞麓县已出动一万五千多人投入小春加工和抗灾保苗活动，一个力争小春增产的新高潮正在形成。
