Your Excellency Vice-Chairman Zhu De, Your Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai, Distinguished Guests,

Today we commemorate the tenth anniversary of our country's independence. I am particularly pleased that this is also the first time we are celebrating our Independence Day in this great country. I would like to express my gratitude to Your Excellency Vice-Chairman Zhu De, Your Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai, and all the distinguished guests for your presence here.

Please allow me to read a telegram from our Prime Minister which he asked me to convey to you:

"As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of regaining our freedom after nearly four centuries of colonial rule, we are now not only free but also on friendly terms with other countries in the world. We are striving to contribute to world peace and understanding, and to the progress and happiness of our people.

We are very pleased to see the cordial and friendly relations existing between our country and the People's Republic of China. I hope that this relationship will continue to grow in the future, thereby helping our two countries to achieve the goals I just mentioned."

Today, Ceylon has a government dedicated to social transformation along what we call the socialist path, a society that will guarantee everyone every opportunity to develop his personality to the fullest. It is quite clear that freedom itself will be a meaningless empty phrase and become the exclusive privilege of a few if we do not create the necessary economic conditions for the vast majority of the people to enjoy freedom effectively on as broad a basis as possible. Our aim is to seek a social organization that can guarantee freedom and economic stability without abandoning the inherent characteristics of either. This is a long-term and arduous task, but we are determined to continue and never flinch or retreat. To promote the realization of this goal, legislative measures have already been taken in certain areas of our country's industry, transportation, and agriculture; the same measures will be taken in other areas as well.

At the end of last year, Ceylon unfortunately suffered a flood that brought us destruction. Preliminary estimates put the losses at around £50 million, which is a huge loss to the resources of a small country. But with generous international assistance and our determined efforts, we will rebuild from the ruins.

Last year was a year of particular significance in the history of our two countries' relations. Last year today, Mr. Premier, you were in Ceylon and received the warmest and most sincere reception we give to our best and closest friends. The next day (February 5th), our two countries signed a joint communiqué, which powerfully illustrated the sincere and warm friendship between our two peoples. We have deep memories and recollections of this visit. Shortly thereafter, in March of last year, we established this embassy, and we are deeply grateful for the strong support that your government and staff, as well as your colleagues, have consistently given us.

During this year, we also signed a new trade agreement, which is broader in scope than the original. Trade between our two countries is becoming wider and deeper. Your assistance of 75 million rupees (approximately £6 million) which you will give us over the next five years is a generous gesture, and we will use this assistance to complete our rubber replanting and development program, which was started in 1952 with the earnings we obtained from trade with China under the first China-Ceylon trade agreement. All of these have opened up new prospects for developing the friendly ties and mutual cooperation between our two peoples.

This cordial and friendly relationship between our two countries, as well as between our two countries and the vast peoples of Asia and the world, is part of the general trend of the silent integration of all peoples and cultures on the basis of mutual respect and mutual trust. In fact, we have to think and discuss problems from a global perspective today. -- This is absolutely necessary, and not doing so will only bring great danger to ourselves. Peace must be universal; recognition of each other's legitimate rights on the basis of mutual trust and mutual respect must be universal; cooperation must be universal -- and if we cannot achieve all of this, then destruction will also be universal under the conditions of our existing weapons.

Today we cannot harbor a Hobbesian fantasy worldview that sees humans as enemies of each other. What the world urgently needs today is détente -- a short period of respite, a period of recovery -- to reverse the situation and rebuild trust between countries and between peoples. It is precisely because of this urgent need of the times that peaceful coexistence and international cooperation between countries and peoples on the basis of mutual trust and mutual respect have the decisive significance that our two countries and many other countries attach to them. It is also for this reason that we oppose all military alliances and armed blocs. It is also for this reason that we demand an immediate end to all types of colonial rule. Colonial rule is a purely oppressive and extremely unfair system left over from the past, a toxic and outdated thing -- and it is also one of the main reasons for the current tense international situation.

Please, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends, join me in a toast:

To the health of His Excellency Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China,

To the continuous progress and prosperity of the Chinese people,

To the friendship between our two countries and two peoples,

To peaceful coexistence, world peace, and international harmony,

Cheers!

### 在锡兰独立十周年招待会上  锡兰临时代办摩尔西的讲话

　　在锡兰独立十周年招待会上
    锡兰临时代办摩尔西的讲话朱德副主席阁下，周恩来总理阁下，各位尊敬的来宾：
    今天我们纪念我国获得自由十周年。使我特别感到愉快的，这也是我们第一次在这个伟大的国家里庆祝我国的独立纪念日。对于朱德副主席阁下、周恩来总理阁下和各位尊敬的来宾的光临，我在这里表示谢意。
    请允许我宣读我国总理要我转达给你们的电文：
    “我们正在庆祝我们在经受殖民统治将近四百年之后重新获得自由的十周年纪念，我们现在不仅恢复了自由，而且同世界上其他国家友好相处。我们正在尽力为世界和平和谅解，为我国人民的进步和幸福作出我们的贡献。
    我们很高兴地看到，我国和中华人民共和国之间存在着亲切友好的关系。我希望这种关系今后将日益增进，从而有助于我们两国实现我刚才所提到的目的。”
    今天锡兰有着一个致力于沿着我们所称的社会主义道路进行社会改造的政府，这样的社会将保证人人有一切机会来最充分地发展他的个性。如果我们不为使广大人民在尽可能广泛的基础上有效地享受自由创造必要的经济条件的话，那么十分清楚，自由本身将是一句无聊的空话，而且会成为少数人专有的特权。我们的目的是寻求一种能够保证自由和经济稳定的社会组织，而同时不放弃这两方面各自的固有特质。这是一项长期和艰巨的任务，但是我们有决心继续下去，绝不畏缩或后退。为促进实现这个目的，已经在我国工业、运输业和农业的某些范围内采取了立法措施；在其他方面也将采取同样的措施。
    去年年底锡兰不幸发生水灾，给我们带来了破坏。初步估计损失大约五千万英镑，这对一个小国的资源来说是巨大的损失。但是在慷慨的国际援助和我们的坚决努力下，我们将在废墟上重建起来。
    去年是我们两国关系史上具有特别重要意义的一年。去年今天，总理先生你在锡兰，受到了我们给予最好的亲密朋友的最热烈和最诚挚的接待。第二天（2月5日）我们两国签署了一项联合公报，这项公报有力地说明了我们两国人民之间的诚挚的和热烈的友谊。我们对这次访问有着深刻的怀念和记忆。不久以后，在去年3月，我们建立了这个大使馆，我们深为感激贵国政府和工作人员以及你们的同事们所一直给予我们的大力支援。
    在这一年里，我们还签订了一项新的贸易协定，这个协定的范围比原来的更为广泛。我们两国之间的贸易正愈来愈广泛和深入了。你们在今后五年内将给予我们七千五百万卢比（约合六百万英镑）的援助，这是一个慷慨的举动，我们将利用这笔援助来完成我们的橡胶翻种和发展计划，这个计划是在1952年用我们从第一次中锡贸易协定规定的对华贸易中所获得的收益开始实施的。所有这些都为发展我们两国人民的友好联系和互相合作开辟了新的远景。
    我们两国之间以及我们两国同亚洲和全世界广大人民之间的这种亲切友好的关系是各国人民和各国文化在互相尊重和互相信任的基础上默然融合的总的趋向的一部分。事实上我们今天不得不从全世界的观点出发来思考和讨论问题。——这是绝对必要的，不这样做只会给我们自己带来极大的危险。和平必须是普遍性的；在互相信任和互相尊重的基础上承认彼此的合法权利必须是普遍性的；合作必须是普遍性的——而如果我们不能够实现这一切，那么在我们现有的武器的条件下，毁灭也将是普遍性的。
    今天我们也不能够怀有霍布士式的奇幻的世界观，认为人与人之间都是仇敌。今天世界上迫切需要的是和缓——一个短短的喘息时期，一个恢复时期——来扭转局势，在各国之间和各国人民之间重新建立信任。正是由于时代的这种迫切需要，所以各国和各国人民在互相信任和互相尊重的基础上和平共处和进行国际合作才具有我们两国和很多其他国家所赋予的决定的意义。也正因为这样，我们反对一切军事同盟和武装集团。同时也正是因为这样，我们要求立刻结束任何类型的殖民统治。殖民统治是过去遗留下来的，纯压迫性的，十分不公平的制度，它是一个有毒的过时了的东西——它也是今天国际局势很紧张的主要原因之一。
    请诸位阁下，女士们，朋友们同我一起
    为中华人民共和国主席毛泽东先生阁下的健康，
    为中国人民的不断进步和繁荣，
    为我们两国和两国人民之间的友谊，
    为和平共处、世界和平和国际和谐，
    干杯！
