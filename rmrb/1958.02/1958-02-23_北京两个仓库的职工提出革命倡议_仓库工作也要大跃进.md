Beijing's Two Warehouse Workers Propose Revolutionary Initiative
Warehouse Work Must Also Have a Great Leap Forward
(Our Newspaper) Following the revolutionary initiative issued by the Tianjin Department Store, the workers of the Maliandao Warehouse and the Joint State-Private Warehouse of the Beijing State-Owned Commercial Storage and Transportation Company yesterday proposed an initiative to all warehouse workers in the city.

The initiative stated: The Tianjin Department Store has issued a revolutionary initiative, and a movement of comparing and competing for progress in the commercial sector is flourishing. All the workers in our two warehouses are determined to catch up, strive to surpass, and join the ranks of the Great Leap Forward in order to cooperate with the Great Leap Forward in the wholesale and retail sectors and better support the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. We hereby propose our initiative:

1. Guarantee the implementation of "Six No's and One Fast" in warehouses from March 1, 1958, that is, no fire, no errors or accidents, no damaged or short items, no rust damage, no mildew, no insect or rodent damage, simple procedures, and fast commodity entry and exit.
2. Improve service quality and attitude: Break with conventions, proactively contact business departments, receive goods upon arrival according to the needs of the inventory units, promptly sort, repack, and package, and pay upon pick-up; deliver goods ordered by phone on time. We will also actively participate in physical labor and will not hire temporary workers at all. We will do a good job in sanitation, ensuring cleanliness in four areas (inside and outside the warehouse, commodities, and personal hygiene are regularly kept clean) and six sides are shining (the warehouse's top, bottom, left, right, front, and back), with a major cleaning and inspection once a month. To achieve the "Six No's and One Fast" warehouse, and to ensure close integration between upper and lower levels, we have decided to strengthen the three-level inspection system of warehouse directors, cargo area leaders, and custodians. When packaging goods, we will handle them with care to ensure 98% are intact.
3. Improve business management and save storage costs: On the basis of the original streamlining of administrative staff by 63%, replacing all eighty temporary workers, all staff in our two warehouses will continue to improve working methods and increase work efficiency. The Maliandao Warehouse will further streamline 12.8% of its existing business staff, and the Joint State-Private Warehouse will streamline 18.3% of its existing business staff. Our two warehouses are currently experiencing tight warehouse capacity. Under the principles of safety, convenience, and economy, by improving stacking methods, the Maliandao Warehouse will increase warehouse capacity by 40% based on the warehouse usage at the end of 1957, and the Joint State-Private Warehouse will increase warehouse capacity by 30%. This year, our two warehouses will save two sleepers per cargo space (calculated at twenty-two square meters), totaling seven thousand six hundred and twenty-two sleepers. This year, we should have purchased 18,500 reed mats, but we are now adopting improved covering methods and will not buy them. In addition, we will also save on office expenses and reduce the fixed consumption of sixteen kinds of commodities. The total savings will be two million and seventy-eight thousand and four hundred yuan.

    北京两个仓库的职工提出革命倡议
    仓库工作也要大跃进
    本报讯　继北京市天桥百货商场发出革命的倡议之后，昨天北京市国营商业储运公司马连道仓库和公私合营仓库的职工向全市全体仓库职工提出倡议。
    倡议书说：天桥百货商场发出了革命的倡议，商业部门比先进、比干劲的运动正在蓬勃发展。我们两个仓库全体职工决心要迎头赶上，奋起直追，投入大跃进的行列中，以配合批发零售部门的大跃进，更好地支持工农业生产的大跃进。谨提出我们的倡议：
    一、保证由1958年3月1日起实行“六无一快”仓库，即无火警，无差错事故，无残短，无锈损，无霉变，无虫吃鼠咬，手续简便，商品出入库快。
    二、提高服务质量，改善服务态度：打破陈规，主动联系业务部门，按存货单位的需要，随到随收，及时分装、改装和整装，随提随付，电话要货按时送到。我们还要积极参加体力劳动，一律不雇用临时工。我们做好卫生工作，保证四洁（库内、外、商品、个人经常保持清洁）、六面光（库房上下左右前后），每月大扫除及检查一次。为实现六无一快仓库，做到上下密切结合，我们决定加强库主任、货区长、保管员三级检查。商品包装时做到轻拆轻放，保证98％完整。
    三、改善经营管理，节约仓储费用：我们两仓库全体工作人员在原精简行政管理人员63％代替全部临时工八十人的基础上，不断改进工作方法，提高工作效率，马连道仓库再精简现有业务人员12.8％，公私合营仓库精简现有业务人员18.3％。我们两仓库正处于仓容紧张的情况，在安全、方便、节约的原则下，通过改善码垛方法，在1957年底库房使用的基础上，马连道仓库提高仓容40％，公私合营仓库提高仓容30％。我们两仓库今年每货位（按二十二平方公尺计算），节省枕木二根，共计七千六百二十二根。今年应购席子一万八千五百片，现采取改善苫垛方法不买了。另外，我们还要节约办公费和降低十六种商品定额损耗。以上共计节约二百零七万八千四百元。
