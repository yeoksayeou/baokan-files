Everyone Should Be a Promoter of Writing Reform
　　Representatives Ye Shengtao, Hu Yuzhi, Luo Changpei, and Wei Que Say the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is Universally Welcomed in Various Regions
　　In order to convey Premier Zhou's report on "The Current Tasks of Writing Reform," Comrade Hu Qiaomu's report on the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, and to promote the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference dispatched six working groups to hold report meetings and symposiums in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Changchun, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. We are all heads of the working groups that were sent out. Now, we are reporting to all representatives the opinions about writing reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme collected by the working groups in various regions, for your reference when discussing the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme.

　　(1) After listening to the recording of Premier Zhou's report, people from all walks of life in various cities unanimously expressed their support for the direction of writing reform and the current tasks. They believe that Premier Zhou's report profoundly and thoroughly elaborated on the direction of writing reform and the current tasks, dispelled some people's doubts and misunderstandings about writing reform, and clarified the direction and tasks of writing reform. At the same time, they realized that the realization of the tasks of writing reform will create conditions for the arrival of a socialist cultural upsurge, and everyone is willing to strive for its realization.

　　(2) People from all walks of life, especially language and writing experts and language workers, who participated in the symposiums in various cities, believe that the draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme promulgated by the State Council inherits the advantages of the phonetic schemes created by the Chinese people in the past. Compared with previous phonetic schemes, it has made great improvements and is the most perfect scheme. Many language and writing experts and language workers, based on their own research and personal experience, pointed out in detail the advantages of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme and expressed their full support for promoting this phonetic scheme. A language worker in Tianjin pointed out that in the past, under the rule of the reactionary government, some people sacrificed their lives in order to promote the Latinized New Writing, and expressed their willingness to use their lives to safeguard this phonetic scheme in the future. A language worker in Shanghai, when attending the mass meeting to convey Premier Zhou's report, recalled the persecution of the Latinization movement by the reactionary government in the past, and now the national leaders are personally giving reports on writing reform. The contrast between the two is like heaven and earth, and he was moved to tears. These vivid examples prove that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, which is now submitted to the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress for approval, is the most popular phonetic scheme.

　　(3) According to the opinions of teachers from normal schools and primary and secondary schools who participated in the symposiums, this phonetic scheme is easy to learn and easy to promote. Many of them have already automatically learned to use this phonetic scheme. They unanimously expressed that there is still plenty of time to prepare for teaching this set of phonetic letters in normal schools and primary and secondary schools this autumn to replace the phonetic symbols, and it can be done.

　　(4) What is particularly worth pointing out is that ethnic minority people and ethnic minority language workers warmly welcome the promulgation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme and unanimously expressed their hope that the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress will pass this phonetic scheme so that ethnic minorities can have a common basis for creating and reforming writing.

　　(5) Regarding the work of popularizing Mandarin, teachers believe that great achievements have been made. Even in areas where the differences between local dialects and Beijing pronunciation are large, as long as leadership is strengthened and promotion is persisted in, achievements can be made. For example, according to statistics from more than 60 counties in Guangdong Province, primary school first and second graders are learning Mandarin, and students can understand it. Second graders can read aloud and answer questions in Mandarin. At the same time, teachers also reflected some difficulties in the promotion, mainly that the society does not understand the significance of popularizing Mandarin enough, so it does not support it much, and the leadership in some places does not pay enough attention to it. In the Northern dialect areas, some provinces and cities still have a "close enough" attitude and have not actively promoted it. Teachers unanimously requested to strengthen social publicity work and hope that the leadership will give more support and encouragement to the work of promoting Mandarin.

　　Based on the above situation, we recommend that the Congress approve the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme and pass the "Report on the Current Work of Writing Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" made by Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee.

　　Writing reform is a measure of great significance for socialist cultural construction. The implementation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme will enable the new generation and the working people to master the motherland's writing more quickly, will accelerate the popularization of Mandarin, eliminate the barriers of various local dialects, promote the further development of the national common language, and create various convenient conditions for the use of writing and symbols. Let us all be promoters of writing reform, fully promote the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, and strive to complete the current tasks of writing reform!

　　大家都来做文字改革的促进派
    叶圣陶、胡愈之、罗常培、韦悫代表说，汉语拼音方案在各地受到普遍欢迎
    为了传达周总理所作“当前文字改革的任务”的报告、胡乔木同志所作关于汉语拼音方案的报告和宣传汉语拼音方案，政协全国委员会派出了六个工作组，分别在北京、天津、沈阳、长春、西安、郑州、太原、成都、重庆、昆明、广州、武汉、南京、上海等城市举行报告会和座谈会。我们都是被派出去的工作组的负责人，现在把工作组在各地所收集的关于文字改革和汉语拼音方案的意见，向各位代表报告，供各位代表在讨论汉语拼音方案的时候作参考。
    （一）各个城市的各界人士听了周总理的报告的录音以后，一致表示拥护文字改革的方针和当前的任务。他们认为周总理的报告精辟地、详尽地阐述了文字改革的方针和当前的任务，解除了一些人对文字改革的疑虑和误解，明确了文字改革的方针和任务。同时他们认识到文字改革的任务的实现将为社会主义文化高潮的到来创造条件，大家都愿意为它的实现而奋斗。
    （二）各个城市参加座谈会的各界人士，特别是语言文字专家和语文工作者，认为国务院公布的汉语拼音方案草案继承了中国人民过去创造的拼音方案的优点，比以前的各种拼音方案，都有很大的改进，是最完善的一个方案。不少语言文字专家和语文工作者根据自己的研究和亲身的体会，详尽地指出了汉语拼音方案的优点，并表示将用全力来推行这个拼音方案。天津有一位语文工作者指出，过去在反动政府的统治下，为了提倡拉丁化新文字，曾经有人牺牲了生命，并表示今后愿意用自己的生命来维护这个拼音方案。上海的一位语文工作者在参加传达周总理报告的万人大会的时候，回忆起过去拉丁化运动受到反动政府迫害的情景，而现在却由国家的领导同志亲自为文字改革做报告，两相对比，真有天渊之别，他感动得流眼泪了。这些生动的事例证明，现在提交第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议批准的汉语拼音方案，是最得人心的拼音方案。
    （三）根据参加座谈会的师范和中、小学教师的意见，这个拼音方案容易学习，便于推行。他们中间已经有很多人自动地学会了使用这个拼音方案。他们一致表示今年秋季在师范和中、小学教学这套拼音字母来替代注音字母，现在还有充分的时间作准备，是可以做到的。
    （四）特别值得指出的，少数民族人士和少数民族语文工作者热烈地欢迎汉语拼音方案的公布，并一致表示，希望第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议通过这个拼音方案，使少数民族创造文字和改革文字有个共同的基础。
    （五）关于推广普通话的工作，教师们都认为有很大的成绩，就是在方音与北京语音差别较大的地区，只要加强领导，坚持推广，也能取得成绩。例如据广东省六十多个县的统计，小学一二年级都学普通话，学生都能够听懂，二年级能够用普通话朗读和回答问题。同时教师们也反映了推广中的一些困难，主要是社会上对推广普通话的意义还不够了解，因而不大支持，有些地方的领导上也还重视不够。北方话地区中，有些省市还有“差不多”的看法，没有认真推广。教师们一致要求加强社会宣传工作，并希望领导上对推广普通话的工作给以更多的支持和鼓励。
    根据以上情况，我们建议大会批准汉语拼音方案，并通过中国文字改革委员会吴玉章主任所作“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”。
    文字改革是社会主义文化建设的一件具有重大意义的措施。汉语拼音方案的推行将使新的一代和劳动人民更快地掌握祖国的文字，将加速普通话的推广，消除各地方言的隔阂，促进民族共同语的进一步的发展，创造使用文字和符号的种种便利的条件。大家都来做文字改革的促进派吧，全力推行汉语拼音方案，为完成当前文字改革的任务而奋斗！
