Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, February 1st – At today's Military Armistice Commission meeting, Major General Kang Sang-ho, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, lodged the strongest protest with the U.S. side regarding a series of serious violations of the armistice agreement, such as the U.S. side's introduction of atomic weapons into South Korea and the holding of provocative atomic strike exercises near the Demilitarized Zone. Kang Sang-ho demanded that the U.S. side immediately cease such actions, immediately remove all illegally imported weapons, including atomic weapons, from South Korea, and report this matter to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

In his speech, Kang Sang-ho pointed out that since the Korean Armistice, the U.S. side has consistently and resolutely obstructed the peaceful reunification of Korea as stipulated in the armistice agreement and desired by all Korean people. Ignoring the increasingly loud calls from the people of both North and South Korea for "Yankee Imperialists to get out of Korea," the U.S. side is plotting to have American troops permanently occupy South Korea, turning South Korea into a living hell, a place where American occupiers run rampant in broad daylight.

He continued, stating that since the armistice, the U.S. side has violated important clauses of the armistice agreement. From the very first day of the armistice until now, the U.S. side has continuously engaged in various hostile acts in violation of the armistice agreement. The U.S. side has also illegally expanded the Rhee Syngman puppet army and has rudely prohibited the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the international body that supervises the implementation of the armistice agreement, in South Korea. In particular, on June 21, 1957, in order to turn South Korea into an American atomic war base, the U.S. side openly announced the unilateral abrogation of item 13(d) of the armistice agreement, and then shipped new-style weapons, including F-100 aircraft, into South Korea. The U.S. side also reorganized the American occupation forces into "five-unit atomic divisions" and illegally stopped submitting operational materials replacement reports to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Recently, the U.S. side has made provocative moves that blatantly violate the armistice agreement and seriously threaten the peace of Korea, Asia, and the world. On January 29, the United Nations Command officially announced that atomic cannons with a caliber of 280 millimeters, capable of launching atomic warheads, had been shipped into South Korea. Kim Chung-yul, the "Minister of National Defense" of the Rhee Syngman puppet government, also confirmed this fact and clamored that "we have the capability to use them at any time in an emergency." Prior to this, from January 20 to January 25, the U.S. side conducted the largest atomic strike exercise since the armistice near the Demilitarized Zone. The general commander of the exercise, U.S. Lieutenant General Trudeau, clamored that the purpose of the exercise was to test the "nuclear strike force" of the U.S. military and the Rhee Syngman army and to train the U.S. forces stationed in South Korea "to become offensive rather than defensive forces."

Kang Sang-ho said that the aforementioned U.S. provocative actions are a continuation of a series of heinous activities by the U.S. side to undermine the armistice agreement since the armistice. This once again proves that the U.S. side openly announced the unilateral abrogation of item 13(d) of the armistice agreement on June 21, 1957, in order to turn South Korea into an American atomic war base, as part of the American plan to prepare for atomic war.

He also said that, at the same time, the aforementioned U.S. criminal acts show that under the current circumstances in which the so-called "position of strength" policy of the American ruling clique has been frustrated and the United States has lost prestige, as part of the policy of forcing "allied" and other vassal states to offer their territories as American atomic war bases, the American imperialist aggressors are actively preparing for atomic war in the Far East, attempting to turn South Korea into a hotbed of atomic war.

Kang Sang-ho pointed out that the U.S. side is attempting to use these provocative actions to seriously undermine the armistice agreement, further destabilize the Korean armistice, and frustrate the ardent desire of the Korean people to peacefully reunify their motherland. In addition, the U.S. side is also using these provocative actions to encourage the Rhee Syngman gang, which is trying to "march north," in an attempt to realize the insidious and criminal plot of reigniting the flames of fratricide in Korea. The U.S. side, since the beginning of the New Year, has been threatening the people of South Korea with atomic strike exercises and atomic weapons, attempting to use these provocative actions to counter the unprecedentedly high anti-American and anti-Rhee sentiment in South Korea and to cope with the upcoming South Korean National Assembly elections. The U.S. side is attempting to use this approach to continue to maintain the bankrupt American imperialist colonial policy and the crumbling fascist dictatorial rule of the Rhee Syngman gang. These provocative actions by the U.S. side are contrary to the desire of peace-loving people around the world to strive for world peace and security, they exacerbate international tensions, and seriously threaten the peace of Korea and Asia.

Kang Sang-ho pointed out that the U.S. side's introduction of atomic weapons into South Korea and the holding of provocative atomic strike exercises near the Demilitarized Zone – this series of criminal acts are blatant violations of the preamble of the armistice agreement and item 13(d) of the armistice agreement, as well as other relevant clauses, and are serious acts of destruction.

Kang Sang-ho warned the U.S. side that if the U.S. side does not stop its criminal acts, the U.S. side will bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

Kang Sang-ho said that the U.S. side's crude act of playing with fire cannot intimidate the Korean people, nor can it hinder their determination to peacefully reunify Korea. It will only be met with further condemnation from the Korean people and peace-loving people around the world.

He emphasized that the armistice agreement must be observed, the armistice must lead to a consolidated peace, and the Korean question must be resolved peacefully by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis. To this end, the futile war schemes of the American aggressors and the Rhee Syngman gang in South Korea should be stopped, and the colonial rule of the American aggressors should be abolished without delay. This is the urgent demand of all Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and it is also fully in line with the interests of peace-loving people around the world.

After Major General Kang Sang-ho's speech, the U.S. Chief Representative, Little Kist, repeated some platitudes to quibble about the crimes of the U.S. side. He also repeated fabricated facts that had been exposed in the past, falsely accusing the Korean-Chinese side of violating the armistice agreement first, saying that the U.S. side's unilateral abrogation of item 13(d) of the armistice agreement and the series of illegal acts of shipping atomic weapons into South Korea were in order to achieve "maintaining a balance of military power" and "for defense." He also described the U.S. side's violation of the armistice agreement by illegally shipping atomic weapons into South Korea as "replacing" old weapons with new weapons. He indicated his refusal to remove atomic weapons from South Korea. He hastily proposed an adjournment after his speech.

Major General Kang Sang-ho immediately pointed out that the U.S. side's unilateral announcement of the abrogation of item 13(d) of the armistice agreement on June 21 of last year was itself a serious violation of the armistice agreement, and that this act was completely illegal and invalid. The U.S. side's attempt to use this act to justify the U.S. side's new acts of undermining the armistice agreement is laughable. Kang Sang-ho pointed out that the U.S. side today repeated the false accusations against the Korean-Chinese side that have been exposed in order to conceal the truth, deceive public opinion, and evade responsibility. Kang Sang-ho said that as for the Korean-Chinese side, it has always strictly abided by the armistice agreement since the armistice and has consistently strived to maintain the armistice agreement from being undermined by the U.S. side, to transform the armistice into a consolidated peace, and to enable the Korean question to be resolved peacefully.

Kang Sang-ho reiterated that the U.S. side's provocative actions, such as the introduction of atomic weapons into South Korea, are a continuation of the U.S. side's consistent undermining of the armistice agreement since the armistice, and that no actions or quibbles by the U.S. side can conceal its criminal acts, cannot make such actions permissible, and cannot evade responsibility.

Kang Sang-ho finally reiterated his demand that the U.S. side immediately cease all criminal activities and immediately remove all weapons, including atomic weapons, illegally imported by the U.S. side into South Korea. He warned the U.S. side again that if the U.S. side does not stop these criminal acts, the U.S. side will bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

　　美国非法把原子武器运入南朝鲜
    朝中方面提出最强硬抗议
    要求美方立即停止挑衅行动运出所有非法运入的武器
    新华社板门店1日电　朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将今天在军事停战委员会的会议上就美方把原子武器运入南朝鲜并在非军事区附近举行挑衅性的原子突击演习等一系列的严重破坏停战协定的行为向美方提出最强硬的抗议。姜尚昊要求美方立即停止这种行动，立即从南朝鲜运出非法运入的包括原子武器在内的所有武器，并且就这件事向军事停战委员会、中立国监察委员会提出报告。
    姜尚昊在发言中指出，朝鲜停战以来，美方一向坚决阻挠停战协定中所规定的和全体朝鲜人民所渴望的朝鲜的和平统一，美方不顾南北朝鲜人民的“美帝国主义滚出朝鲜”的呼声越来越响亮的事实，策划让美国军队永久占领南朝鲜，使南朝鲜成为人间地狱，成为美国占领者在光天化日之下横行霸道的地方。
    他接着说，同时，停战以来，美方破坏了停战协定的重要条款。自从实行停战的头一天起直到现在，美方违反停战协定不断地进行了各种各样的敌对行为；美方还非法扩充了李承晚伪军，并且粗暴地禁止了监督停战协定实施的国际机构中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜的活动。特别是在1957年6月21日，美方为了把南朝鲜变成美国的原子战争基地，公然宣布片面废除停战协定第十三款卯项，然后把包括F—100型的飞机在内的新式武器运入南朝鲜。美方还把美国占领军改编为“五单位原子师”，并且非法停止向中立国监察委员会送交作战物资替换报告。最近，美方又作出了悍然破坏停战协定并且严重威胁朝鲜、亚洲和世界和平的挑衅行为。1月29日，联合国军司令部正式宣称，能够发射原子弹头的口径为二百八十公厘的原子大炮已经运入南朝鲜。李承晚伪政府“国防部长官”金贞烈也证实了这个事实，并且叫嚣“有能力在紧急情况下随时可以使用它们”。在此以前，在1月20日到1月25日期间，美方在非军事区附近举行了停战以来规模最大的原子突击演习。演习总指挥、美军中将特鲁多叫嚣说，演习的目的就是要试验美军和李承晚军队的“核攻击力量”，并且把驻在南朝鲜的美国部队训练“成为进攻的而不是防御的部队”。
    姜尚昊说，上述美方挑衅行为是停战以来美方一贯进行的破坏停战协定的一系列的罪恶活动的延续。这又一次证明，美方所以在1957年6月21日公然宣布片面废除停战协定第十三款卯项，是为了要把南朝鲜变为美国的原子战争基地，以此作为美国准备原子战争的计划的一部分。
    他又说，同时，上述美方罪恶行为表明，在目前美国统治集团的所谓“实力地位”政策遭到挫折，美国丧失威信的情况下，作为强迫“盟国”和其它附庸国家提供它们的领土当作美国原子战争基地的政策的一部分，美帝国主义侵略者在远东积极地准备原子战争，企图把南朝鲜变为原子战争的温床。
    姜尚昊指出，美方企图利用这种挑衅行为来严重破坏停战协定，使朝鲜停战进一步处于不稳定状态，并且挫折朝鲜人民的要求和平统一祖国的炽烈的愿望。此外，美方还利用这种挑衅行为来鼓励力图“北进”的李承晚匪帮，企图在朝鲜实现再次燃起同族相戮的火焰的毒辣的罪恶阴谋。美方从新年开始就以原子突击演习和原子武器威胁南朝鲜人民，企图利用这种挑衅行为来对付在南朝鲜空前高涨的反美反李情绪和应付即将到来的南朝鲜国会选举。美方企图利用这种作法继续维持趋于破产的美帝国主义殖民政策和摇摇欲坠的李承晚匪帮的法西斯独裁统治。美方的这种挑衅行为是违背全世界爱好和平人民争取世界和平和安全的愿望的，它加剧了国际紧张局势，严重地威胁到朝鲜和亚洲的和平。
    姜尚昊指出，美方把原子武器运入南朝鲜并在非军事区附近举行挑衅性的原子突击演习。这一系列的罪恶行为是悍然违反停战协定的序言和停战协定第十三款卯项以及其他有关条款的严重的破坏行为。
    姜尚昊警告美方说，如果美方不停止罪恶行为，美方应对由此而产生的一切后果负完全的责任。
    姜尚昊说，美方的粗暴的玩火勾当吓不倒朝鲜人民，也不能阻挠他们的要求和平统一朝鲜的决心。它只会遭到朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的进一步的谴责。
    他强调说，停战协定必须遵守，停战必须导致巩固的和平，朝鲜问题必须由朝鲜人民自己在民主的基础上予以和平解决。为此，在南朝鲜应该停止美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮的无益的战争阴谋，应该不迟延地废除美国侵略者的殖民统治。这是全体朝鲜人民渴望祖国和平统一的迫切要求，这也完全符合全世界爱好和平人民的利益。
    在姜尚昊少将发言后，美方首席代表小基斯特重复一些滥调为美方的罪行诡辩。他又重复过去已被揭穿了的捏造的事实，诬指朝中方面先违反停战协定，说什么美方片面废除停战协定第十三款卯项并把原子武器运进南朝鲜的一系列非法行为是为了取得“保持军力均衡”，“为了防御”，他并且把美方破坏停战协定把原子武器非法运进南朝鲜的行为说成是以新武器“替换”旧武器。他表示拒绝把原子武器运出南朝鲜。他发言后即慌忙建议休会。
    姜尚昊少将当即指出，去年6月21日美方片面宣布废除停战协定第十三款卯项的行为本身就严重地破坏了停战协定，这种行为是完全非法和无效的。美方要想利用这种行为来替美方的新的破坏停战协定的行为辩护，这种逻辑是可笑的。姜尚昊指出，美方今天再次重复已被揭露的对朝中方面虚假的指控，是为了掩盖事实真相，欺骗舆论和规避责任。姜尚昊说，至于朝中方面，停战以来一向严格遵守停战协定，并且一贯努力维护停战协定不致遭到美方破坏，把停战转变为巩固和平，并使朝鲜问题得到和平解决。
    姜尚昊再次指出，美方把原子武器运进南朝鲜等挑衅行为是停战以来美方一贯破坏停战协定的延续，美方的任何作法和诡辩都不能掩盖它的罪恶行为，不能把这种行为说成是可以的，而且也不能规避责任。
    姜尚昊最后再次要求美方立即停止一切罪恶活动，立即从南朝鲜运出美方非法运入南朝鲜的包括原子武器在内的所有武器。他再次警告美方，如果美方不停止这种罪恶行为，美方应对由此而产生的一切后果负完全责任。
