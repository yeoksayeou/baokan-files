Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: According to a report by the Bulgarian News Agency, Bulgarian Minister of Council Chairman Yugov recently received Moscow Radio reporter Tidenko and answered questions posed by Tidenko.

    Tidenko asked what Yugov's opinion was regarding claims made by Western countries that Bulgaria had seemingly established thermonuclear weapon and rocket weapon bases, causing Turkey to feel afraid.

    Yugov said that the U.S. imperialist bloc and their cohorts in the Balkans and the Middle East are well aware that there are no atomic bases or rocket bases in Bulgaria. However, they like to fabricate such things in order to cover up their true intentions and plans, namely to use this as a pretext to establish atomic weapon and rocket weapon bases within the Baghdad Pact countries—and, if they can manage it, also on the territories of certain Balkan Peninsula countries. Obviously, Western imperialism and certain adventurous groups in Turkey are trying to shift the blame onto others in order to find excuses for their own war preparations. They are attempting to deceive public opinion and numb the vigilance of the people in the Baghdad Pact member states with rumors fabricated by imperialist propaganda centers. It is well known that the Turkish government has already agreed to construct atomic weapon and rocket weapon bases in Turkey. Now Western countries are trying to get the governments of other participants in the Baghdad Pact to agree to do the same.

    However, under the pressure of the masses, the ruling groups of these countries are not particularly willing to turn the territories of their countries into territories inevitably doomed to destruction in the event of a war launched by the imperialists. We hope that the public in these countries—including Turkey—will not be deceived by the baseless rumors that Bulgaria has atomic and rocket bases.

### 于哥夫斥帝国主义无中生有  保境内无任何原子火箭基地

    于哥夫斥帝国主义无中生有
    保境内无任何原子火箭基地
    据新华社22日讯　据保加利亚通讯社报道，保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫最近接见了莫斯科电台记者季邓科，回答了季邓科向他提出的问题。
    季邓科问道，西方国家说，保加利亚境内似乎已经建立了热核武器和火箭武器基地，因而使土耳其感到害怕。他问于哥夫对这种说法有什么意见？
    于哥夫说，美国帝国主义集团和他们在巴尔干和中近东的伙计很清楚，保加利亚境内没有任何原子基地和火箭基地。但是，他们却喜欢作这种臆造，目的是为了掩饰自己的真正意图和计划，即借此得以在巴格达条约国家境内——如果搞得成的话，还想在某些巴尔干半岛国家的领土上——建立原子武器和火箭武器基地。显然，西方帝国主义和土耳其某些冒险集团力图嫁祸于人，以便替自己的备战措施寻找借口。他们企图以帝国主义宣传中心捏造的谣言来欺骗舆论，麻痹巴格达条约参加国人民的警惕性。大家知道，土耳其政府已经同意在土耳其建筑原子武器和火箭武器的基地。现在西方国家企图要巴格达条约的其他参加国的政府也同意这样做。
    但是，这些国家的统治集团在人民群众的压力下，不怎么特别愿意使自己国家的领土在帝国主义者一旦发动战争时变成必然遭到毁灭的领土。我们希望，这些国家——其中包括土耳其——的公众不致受无中生有地说保加利亚有原子和火箭基地这种谣言所骗。
