    According to preliminary plans from various regions, national fruit production will experience significant development and a great leap forward in the next ten years. By 1962, the planting area for six fruits—apples, oranges, pears, grapes, bananas, and pineapples—will reach 28,240,000 mu, with a total output of 2,980,000 tons. The planting area will increase by 1,142% compared to 1952, and the total output will increase by 333% compared to 1952. By 1967, the planting area will surge to 51,930,000 mu, and the total output will surge to 10,970,000 tons, representing an increase of 2,099% in planting area and 1,222% in output compared to 1952.
    The significant development of fruit production will further boost the mountain economy, meet the growing needs of the people, and support national construction.
    During the first Five-Year Plan, national fruit production already experienced substantial development. The area for six fruits, including apples, oranges, pears, grapes, bananas, and pineapples, more than doubled, and output increased by one-third. In many regions, the slogan "transforming barren mountains into orchards" and "transforming sandy beaches into orchards" has become a reality. In Yixian, Beizhen, and four other counties in Liaoning Province, more than three million apple trees have been planted in the past five years. In Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province, more than 270,000 citrus trees have been planted on reclaimed mountain land in the past two years. In Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, more than 3,000 mu of apple and peach trees planted on the sandy wasteland of the old Yellow River course have already begun to bear fruit. The barren hills and ridges of the past are beginning to "green" and "colorize," and the "poor sandy beaches" will be transformed into "golden sandy beaches." The confidence of farmers in building mountainous areas and changing the face of sandy wastelands has also been greatly strengthened.
    In order to adapt to the future development of fruit production, various provinces will establish fruit production bases in a planned manner to provide a large quantity of commercial fruit to meet the needs of export, domestic sales, and processing. In the old Yellow River course area of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces, it is estimated that 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 mu of fruit trees can be developed. The survey and planning for this area will be completed this year. The plan for planting walnuts in Shaanxi will be completed this year, and the ten-year plan for planting pears and apples will also be completed within five years.
    "Look at ten years in three, and focus on the first year of the three," and all regions have generally paid attention to this year's fruit production. In terms of cultivating high-quality fruit seedlings, many regions have already made arrangements. For example, the key counties in Liaoning Province for developing new fruit trees have basically achieved having a state-owned fruit tree nursery in each county. It is estimated that about 70 million apple, citrus, and other fruit seedlings can be cultivated nationwide this year. If all of them can be planted well, the fruit tree area can be expanded by about 2 million mu, equivalent to 80% of the area of these fruits in 1952. Fruit production will also increase significantly this year. The agricultural departments in many fruit-producing areas have proposed that while organizing a great leap forward in agricultural production, the output of existing fruit trees should also be greatly increased, and they require key fruit-producing areas to ensure that every county has a high-yield cooperative and every cooperative has a high-yield orchard.
    In order to effectively impart technology, the agricultural department of Liaoning Province will soon organize experienced fruit farmers from old fruit-producing areas to teach pruning and other technologies in new fruit-producing areas. At present, many fruit-producing areas have already held or are holding technical training classes for fruit farmers. In order to actively strive for "protecting flowers, protecting fruits, increasing production, and increasing income," great importance has been attached to the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. Agricultural cooperatives in fruit-producing areas are preparing various pesticides and equipment, and agricultural, forestry, and commercial departments will also organize cadres to assist agricultural cooperatives in providing technical guidance, and strive to carry out large-scale thorough prevention and control, and strive to produce more and better fruits this year.

　　1958—1967主要水果产量将增长八倍
    本报讯　各地初步规划表明，全国果树生产在今后十年中将有大发展，大跃进。到1962年，苹果、柑桔、梨、葡萄、香蕉、菠萝六种水果的种植面积将达到二千八百二十四万亩，产量将达到二百九十八万吨。种植面积将比1952年提高到1，142％，总产量将比1952年提高到333％；而到1967年，种植面积将激增到五千一百九十三万亩，总产量将激增到一千零九十七万吨，种植面积比1952年提高到2，099％，产量提高到1，222％。
    果树生产大发展，将进一步繁荣山区经济，满足人民日益增长的需要，支援国家建设。
    在第一个五年计划期间，全国果树已经有了很大的发展。苹果、柑桔、梨、葡萄、香蕉、菠萝等六种水果面积增长了一倍多；产量提高到三分之一。在许多地区“荒山变果园”和“沙滩变果园”的口号已经成了现实。辽宁省义县、北镇等六个县，五年来共栽苹果树三百余万株；广东省潮阳县两年来也在山地开荒种柑树达二十七万余株。江苏省徐州市在黄河故道沙荒上栽植的三千多亩苹果树、桃树，有的已经结了果。过去的荒山秃岭开始“绿化”、“彩化”，“穷沙滩”将变为“金沙滩”了。农民建设山区、改变沙荒面貌的信心因此也大为加强。
    为了适应今后果树生产发展，各省将有计划地建立果树生产基地，以便提供大量商品水果，供应出口、内销和加工的需要。河南、安徽、江苏、山东四省内黄河故道地区，估计可以发展果树一百万到一百五十万亩，今年该区的勘察规划就要全部完成。陕西种核桃的计划，将在今年内完成；种植梨、苹果的十年计划，也将在五年内完成。
    “十年看三年，三年抓头年”，各地普遍注意了今年的果树生产。在培育优良果苗的工作上，许多地区已经作了安排，如辽宁省新发展果树的重点县已基本做到每县有一个国营果树苗圃。预计今年全国可以培育出苹果、柑桔等果苗约七千万株，如能全部栽好，可以扩大果树面积约二百万亩，相当于1952年这几种水果面积的80％。水果的产量今年也将有显著的提高。许多果区的农业部门已提出在组织农业生产大跃进的同时，也要把现有果树产量大大提高一步，并要求重点果区做到县县有丰产社、社社有丰产园。
    为了有效地传授技术，辽宁省农业部门即将组织老果区有经验的果农到新果区传授修剪等技术。目前不少果区已经或正在举办果农技术训练班。各地为积极争取作到“保花、保果，增产、增收”，对于防治病虫害给予了很大的重视。果区农业社正在纷纷准备各种防治药剂和器械，农、林、商业等部门也将组织干部协助农业社进行技术指导，为开展大面积彻底防治，争取今年生产更多更好的水果而努力。（附图片）
