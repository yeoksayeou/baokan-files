Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 21st - Jacques Duclos, chairman of the French Communist Party's parliamentary group, delivered a speech on February 20th during the National Assembly's discussion of the draft law on amending the Constitution. He opposed the government's proposed bill and pointed out the dangers concealed in the various proposals and supplementary motions put forward by those seeking constitutional amendments.

Duclos pointed out that some people attribute the short life of successive French governments to the Constitution. However, if governments have not lasted long, the reasons should be sought in their failure to adhere to promises made to voters and in the overthrow of electoral alliances, which has created a gap between government policies and the hopes of the people.

Duclos said that the government intends to stabilize the cabinet by amending the Constitution. However, fortresses do not always fall due to external attacks. We all know that governments collapse almost always due to the disintegration of the government majority, especially when the government majority is a makeshift majority riddled with internal contradictions.

Duclos pointed out that the actual aim of these people is to subject the majority of the people to the will of the minority, so that the left-wing majority that won the 1956 election is forced to prolong the current situation, where the policies of the minority that was defeated at the time are imposed upon them.

Duclos concluded by saying that the problems facing France cannot be solved by giving the Constitution a reactionary content. A left-wing majority should be formed both in Parliament and nationwide. Everything possible must be done to unite all left-wing figures to crush the right-wing conspiracy.

    杜克洛在法国国民议会演说
    反对政府修改宪法的阴谋
    据新华社巴黎21日电　法国共产党议会党团主席杜克洛20日在国民议会讨论修改宪法法案时发表演说，反对政府所提出的法案，同时指出了在要求修改宪法的人所提出的各种建议和补充提案中所包藏的危险。
    杜克洛指出，有些人把法国历届政府命运的短促归咎于宪法，但是，如果各届政府寿命不长，就应该从不遵守对选民提出的诺言、从推翻选举联盟以至于造成政府的政策同人民的希望之间的鸿沟这两点中去找原因。
    杜克洛说，政府打算通过修改宪法达到稳定内阁的目的，但是，堡垒并不总是由于外部的打击而陷落的。我们都知道，政府差不多总是由于政府多数派的瓦解而垮台的，尤其是当政府多数是一个内部矛盾百出的临时凑合的多数的时候。
    杜克洛指出，实际上这些人的目的是要使人民的多数屈从于少数人的意志，使得在1956年选举中取得胜利的左派多数反而要被当时被击败的少数派把他们的政策强加在自己身上的现状得以延长。
    杜克洛最后说：要解决法国面临的问题，想用给予宪法以反动内容的办法是不行的，应该既在议会、也在全国组成左派多数。必须尽一切可能来团结一切左派人士以粉碎右派的阴谋。
