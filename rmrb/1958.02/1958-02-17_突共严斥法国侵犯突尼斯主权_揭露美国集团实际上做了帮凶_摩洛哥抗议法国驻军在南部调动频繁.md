Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to a Xinhua News Agency report: Paris' "L'Humanité" published a statement on February 15 by the Tunisian Communist Party regarding the French air force bombing of Tunisia.

The statement said, "French imperialists, with the support of other Western countries, have violated our country's sovereignty. These countries, at a recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, recognized France's 'special position' in North Africa. France would not be able to continue the Algerian war and infringe upon our independence without billions of dollars from the United States and West Germany."

The statement said, "The purpose of the French imperialists' bombing of the village of Sakiet-Sidi-Youssef is to retaliate against Tunisia's actions in forming a solid alliance with fighting Algeria. The French imperialists and their Western allies are trying every possible means to create division between us and the national liberation forces of other Arab countries, because these forces, especially with the emergence of the United Arab Republic, make them panic-stricken."

More than a thousand university students in Paris held a demonstration on February 14 to protest the French air force's atrocity of bombing Sakiet. The French authorities sent a large number of police in advance to gather in the originally planned demonstration site, Saint-Germain-des-Prés Street, in an attempt to stop the students' righteous actions, but these students gathered in another district. This demonstration was jointly organized by the French Communist Student Union, the National Federation of Radical Socialist Party Students, and the Left-wing Student Union of the Socialist Party.

A mass protest meeting scheduled for the evening of February 14 in the Wagram Hall in Paris, with representatives of the French left participating, was banned by the police authorities and could not be held. The people who organized this meeting held a press conference. They explained that the purpose of their mass meeting was not only to protest the French air force's atrocity of bombing Tunisia, but also to let people hear the voice of the majority of the French people in order to ensure that similar incidents would not happen again in the future. Speakers emphasized the seriousness of the French government's bombing of Sakiet.

According to a Jiddah dispatch: Saudi Arabian King Saud sent a telegram to Tunisian President Bourguiba on February 15, expressing his support for Tunisia's struggle against French aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, February 16th: Rabat News: The Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on February 15 that the Moroccan government has protested to the French government regarding France's "frequent and large-scale troop movements" in the Agadir region of southern Morocco.

The Moroccan Foreign Ministry's statement said: The French military's movements in this area are further aggravated by the fact that such movements are considered by local residents to be related to the Spanish troop movements in southern Morocco, while Spanish troops are fighting the armed uprising people in the Ifni region against colonial rule.

    突共严斥法国侵犯突尼斯主权

    摩洛哥抗议法国驻军在南部调动频繁
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：巴黎“人道报”15日刊载了突尼斯共产党就法国空军轰炸突尼斯事件发表的声明。
    声明说，“法国帝国主义者在其他西方国家的支持下，侵犯了我国的主权。这些国家在北大西洋公约组织理事会最近的一次会议上曾经承认法国在北非的‘特殊地位’。法国如果没有从美国和西德那里得到上千亿的美元，是不可能继续进行阿尔及利亚战争和侵犯我国的独立的。”
    声明说，“法国帝国主义者轰炸萨基埃特—西迪—优素福村的目的，是企图对突尼斯同战斗的阿尔及利亚结成巩固联盟的行动进行报复。法国帝国主义者和他们的西方同盟者千方百计想在我们和其他阿拉伯国家的民族解放力量之间制造隔阂，因为这些力量，特别是在阿拉伯联合共和国出现了的时候，使得他们惶恐不安。”
    巴黎一千多大学生在14日举行示威，抗议法国空军轰炸萨基埃特的暴行。法国当局派出大批警察事先聚集在原定的示威地点圣日耳曼德普雷街，企图制止学生们的正义行动，但是这些大学生却在另一个区里集合起来。这次示威是法兰西共产主义学生联盟、激进社会党学生全国联合会和社会党左派学生联盟共同组织的。
    预定14日晚间在巴黎瓦格朗姆大厦举行的一次有法国左派代表人物参加的群众性抗议大会，由于警察当局的禁止而未能举行。组织这次大会的人士举行了记者招待会。他们说明：他们召开群众大会的目的不仅是抗议法空军轰炸突尼斯的暴行，而且是要让人们听见法国大多数人的呼声，以保证将来不再发生类似的事件。发表演说的人都强调指出法国政府轰炸萨基埃特的作法的严重性。
    另据吉达消息：沙特阿拉伯国王沙特15日打电报给突尼斯总统布尔吉巴，表示支持突尼斯反对法国侵略的斗争。
    新华社16日讯　拉巴特消息：摩洛哥外交部15日宣布，摩洛哥政府已经就法国在摩洛哥南部阿加迪尔区“经常和大批地调动军队”向法国政府提出抗议。
    摩洛哥外交部的声明说：法国军队在这个地区的调动由于下述原因而更加严重：这种调动被当地居民认为是同西班牙在摩洛哥南部的军队调动有联系的，而西班牙的军队正在同伊夫尼地区反抗殖民主义统治的武装起义人民作战。
