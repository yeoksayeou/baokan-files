Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th: The United States Air Force suffered another failure on the 7th when testing the "Atlas" intercontinental missile at Cape Canaveral, Florida.

The official statement evasively said that the missile "self-destructed immediately after completing the powered phase of its flight." The test site director refused to say how far the missile flew or how far it was originally intended to fly.

Some observers who watched the launch from the bay a few miles south of the launch site said they saw the missile break apart. It is believed that the missile, by any standard, cannot be said to have reached its intended target.

Prior to this, the "Atlas" missile had been tested three times. The first two tests were failures, and the third was said to have flown only 960 kilometers.

　　美国洲际导弹
    “阿特拉斯”火箭又自焚
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国空军7日在佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角试验“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹时又一次遭到失败。
    官方声明遮遮掩掩地说，导弹“在飞完了备有发动力的阶段后立即自行烧毁”。试验场负责人拒绝说明这枚导弹到底飞了多远以及它原定要飞多远。
    在发射场地以南几英里的海湾上观察发射情况的一些观察家说，他们看见这枚导弹裂开。人们认为，这枚导弹不论用什么标准来看，都不能说达到预定目标。
    在这以前，“阿特拉斯”导弹已经试验过三次，头两次试验都是失败，第三次据说只飞了九百六十公里。
