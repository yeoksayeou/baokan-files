Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: Xinhua News Agency reporters Lei Runming and Zhao Jialie report: In the rectification campaign, the Beijing Railway Bureau, based on the opinions of the broad masses of workers, boldly innovated and reformed the unreasonable aspects of three major rules and regulations. These three rules and regulations are: locomotive overhaul and medium repair rules, vehicle maintenance regulations, and building maintenance regulations. After the unreasonable parts of these regulations were reformed, the relevant units within the bureau's jurisdiction have recently implemented them in accordance with the new spirit.

To ensure traffic safety and complete transportation tasks, locomotives need to undergo regular overhauls, medium repairs, light repairs, and washing repairs. The Ministry of Railways' 1955 order regarding the overhaul and medium repair of steam locomotives stipulated that freight and passenger locomotives that had traveled 400,000 or 450,000 kilometers or more should undergo an overhaul. This was correct at the time when locomotive quality was not high. However, as locomotive quality improved, locomotive maintenance quality increased, and especially with the great improvement of locomotive maintenance work, this regulation was not entirely in line with objective reality. Now, 65.7% of the bureau's locomotives are new, and the old locomotives have also been modernized steam locomotives after technical modifications. Under this new situation, many locomotives have actually greatly exceeded the Ministry of Railways' stipulated mileage between two overhauls. For example, the old MK-type freight locomotives of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot had traveled 550,000 kilometers between two overhauls. However, due to the limitations of the regulations, in the past two years, five locomotives that only needed medium repair in the whole bureau underwent overhauls, resulting in 1 million fewer kilometers of operation and 30,000 yuan more in repair costs; eleven locomotives that only needed light repair, in order to avoid the regulation that they would have to undergo overhaul after 400,000 kilometers, simply did not undergo light repair after traveling more than 300,000 kilometers, but instead underwent medium repair ahead of schedule. Although this avoided the waste of overhaul, it also suffered the following triple losses: first, due to premature medium repair, each locomotive ran about 100,000 kilometers less; second, because light repair was changed to medium repair, each locomotive operated 20 days less; and third, repair costs increased by 264,000 yuan. The workers compared this outdated regulation to "forcing people with minor illnesses to be hospitalized and have surgery." Because of the influence of this old regulation, there was also a phenomenon of relaxing maintenance of locomotives and not paying attention to further developing the potential of locomotives. Now, the Railway Bureau has decided that in the future, maintenance will be carried out separately according to the specific quality conditions of the locomotives, and the mileage between two overhauls will be extended. In this way, compared with the original regulation calculation method, three locomotives of the bureau can avoid overhaul this year, six can avoid medium repair, and twenty-two can avoid light repair. In addition, with measures such as shortening light repair and washing repair time, the equivalent of five more locomotives will participate in transportation throughout the year, and 780,000 yuan in repair costs will be saved.

The shortcomings of the original vehicle maintenance regulations and building maintenance regulations were mainly that the repair and maintenance periods were stipulated too rigidly. Regardless of the quality of the vehicles and buildings, it was stipulated that repairs must be carried out "upon expiration." Last year alone, the Beijing Vehicle Depot had 22 vehicles that had never been used once after being repaired and 40 vehicles that had been used for less than a month, all of which underwent "annual repair" "according to law," wasting nearly 370,000 yuan in labor and material costs. The No. 7003 dining car on the international train, according to "regulations," should have undergone "annual repair" in September last year, but there was nothing wrong with this car, and there were no other dining cars available to replace it at the time. On September 28, it was driven to Manchuria without being repaired. As a result, this "violation" was criticized by the Vehicle Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which said that their practice of not carrying out repairs on time was "inappropriate" and ordered them to "pay close attention to prevent similar situations from happening again." The workers said dissatisfiedly: Being criticized for not repairing the car on time, but who should be criticized for insisting on repairing the dining car when it was originally in good condition?

In the regulations concerning the maintenance of houses, there is a provision of "complete buildings at each station, once a year," that all houses, regardless of their age or condition, must be renovated every year. In February of last year, the Ministry of Railways made some revisions to this regulation, but it was still not thorough. In the past seven years, the bureau has spent an average of more than 1 million yuan in maintenance costs every year because of the "complete buildings at each station, once a year" maintenance of houses. Recently, an inspection of the bureau's houses found that only 30% of the total number of houses in the bureau needed to be repaired this year, and maintenance costs could be reduced by more than 500,000 yuan compared to last year.

Now, both of these unreasonable regulations have been replaced by new methods. The new methods mainly determine the repair period and how to repair based on the specific conditions of the vehicles and houses, without making rigid regulations. According to the original regulations, the 22 vehicles that needed to be sent to the factory for annual repair this year will be repaired by the vehicle depot instead; the 100 vehicles that need to undergo medium repair this year will be changed to annual repair (general maintenance); and the 257 vehicles that need to undergo annual repair will be changed to deferred annual repair. This can save a total of 1.69 million yuan in maintenance costs.

For the unreasonable parts of the above three rules and regulations, the workers had raised opinions before the rectification campaign, but at that time they were only reported level by level—from sections to offices, and from offices to the bureau, with no results. In this rectification campaign, the responsible persons and staff of various relevant departments of the bureau went deep into the field, mobilized the workers to jointly inspect the conditions of locomotives, vehicles, and houses, and revised the original regulations based on the opinions of the masses, and implemented them within the bureau's jurisdiction. The broad masses of workers in the bureau are very satisfied with this approach of the leadership.

　　打破束缚生产的陈规　堵住浪费资财的漏洞
    北京铁路局大胆革新
    本报特约新华社6日讯　新华社记者雷润明、赵家烈报道：北京铁路管理局在整风运动中，根据广大职工群众的意见，大胆革新，对三项较大的规章制度中的不合理部分进行了改革。这三项规章制度是：机车大、中修规则，车辆检修规定，房屋维修规定。这些规章中的不合理部分被改革以后，这个局的辖区内的各有关单位最近已经按新的精神执行。
    为了保证行车安全，完成运输任务，机车需要定期进行大修、中修、架修、洗修。铁道部1955年关于蒸汽机车进行大、中修的部令中曾经规定，货运、客运机车如已行达四十万或四十五万公里以上，都要进行大修。这在当时机车质量不高的情况下是正确的。但是在机车质量状况改善，机车检修质量提高，特别是大大改进了机车保养工作的情况下，这一规定便同客观实际不完全适合了。现在这个局的机车65.7％都是新的，旧有的机车经过技术改造也已经成为现代化的蒸汽机车。在这种新的情况下，实际上不少机车在两次大修之间的走行公里已经大大地超过了铁道部的规定。如丰台机务段旧有的冖丂—型货运机车在两次大修之间已经走行了五十五万公里。但是由于规章的限制，在过去两年内，全局有五台只需中修的机车进行了大修，少运行一百万公里，多花了修理费三万元；有十一台只要架修的机车，为避免走四十万公里就要大修的规定，在行走了三十多万公里以后，索兴不架修，而提前进行了中修。这样虽然避免了大修的浪费，但也受到下列三重损失：一、因提前中修，使每台机车少运行十万公里左右；二、因由架修改成中修，使每台机车少运行二十天；三、多花了修理费二十六万四千元。职工们把这项过时的规定，比喻为“强迫患小病的人住院开刀”。因为这个旧规章的影响，还出现了放松对机车的保养和不注意进一步发挥机车潜力的现象。现在铁路管理局已决定今后要根据机车的具体质量状况分别进行检修，延长两次大修之间的走行公里。这样，同原规章的计算方法相比，这个局的机车今年就有三台可以不大修，有六台可以不中修，有二十二台可以不架修，再加上缩短架修、洗修时间等措施，全年等于多有五台机车参加运输，并且节省修理费七十八万元。
    原有车辆检修规定和房屋维修规定的缺点，主要是对检修和维修期限规定得太死。不论车辆、房屋质量如何，一律规定“到期”就要修理。仅北京车辆段去年就有修好以后一次也没有用过的二十二辆车和使用时间不到一月的四十辆车，都“依法”进行了“年修”，白白花费工料费近三十七万元。国际列车上的七○○三号餐车，按“规定”应在去年9月份进行“年修”，但这辆车没有一点毛病，当时又没其他餐车可以代替，在9月28日没有经过修理就开往满洲里。结果，这一“违章行为”受到了铁道部车辆局的批评，说他们没按期进行修理的作法“不当”，命令他们“严加注意，防止今后再发生类似情况”。职工们不满意地说：车没有按期修理挨了批评，但是餐车本来很好硬要修理，这又该批评谁呢？
    在有关维修房屋的规章中，有“挨站整栋，一年一遍”的规定，所有房屋，不管新旧好坏，每年都要进行整修。去年2月铁道部曾经对这一规定作了某些修改，但是仍不彻底。这个局在过去七年中，因为“挨站整栋，一年一遍”地对房屋进行维修，平均每年要花维修费一百多万元。最近，对全局房屋进行了一次检查，发现需要在今年进行维修的房屋，只占全局房屋总数的30％，维修费用可以比去年减少五十多万元。
    现在，这两个不合理的规定，都已经被新的办法所代替。新的办法主要是根据车辆和房屋的具体情况，决定修理期限和如何修理，不作硬性规定。按原规章规定今年需要送厂年修的二十二辆车，改由车辆段修理；今年要中修的一百辆车，改成年修（一般性的检修）；需要年修的二百五十七辆车，改为延期年修。这样共可以节省检修费一百六十九万元。
    对于以上三个规章制度中的不合理部分，职工们在整风以前就曾提出过意见，但是那时只是层层上达——段到处，处到局，没有什么结果。在这次整风运动中，这个局各有关方面的负责人和工作人员，深入现场，发动职工共同检查了机车、车辆和房屋的状况，根据群众意见，对原规章作了修改，并且在本局辖区内实施。这个局的广大职工对领导方面的这种做法很满意。
