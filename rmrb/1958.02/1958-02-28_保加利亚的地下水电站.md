    Bulgaria's Underground Hydroelectric Power Station
    The water resources of the Rhodope region in southwestern Bulgaria account for almost 40% of the country's total. Bulgaria's first underground hydroelectric power station to go into production, the "Batak" Hydroelectric Power Station, is located here.

    The entire "Batak" Hydroelectric Power Station system consists of four reservoirs and three hydroelectric power stations: "Batak," "Beshtara," and "Aleko." The first two power stations are built underground. The average total annual power generation of these three stations is 605 million kilowatt-hours. The water flowing through them can also irrigate over 400,000 decares of land (one decare is equivalent to 1.5 Chinese mu). The project involved digging 78 kilometers of tunnels and 45 kilometers of canals.

    The "Batak" Hydroelectric Power Station system is tiered, and its construction began with the Kolarov Reservoir at the top. This reservoir is located at an altitude of 1,600 meters and can hold 65 million cubic meters of water. To channel the water from the reservoir to the "Batak" underground hydroelectric power station, workers had to dig a 12-kilometer-long tunnel under the rolling hills.

    The difficulty of building such a long tunnel, especially one that leads to the turbines of the "Batak" Hydroelectric Power Station, is imaginable. First, the water from the reservoir has to be led to a 100-meter-high water tower, and then, through a 1,300-meter-long underground steel pipe, it flows from a point 420 meters above the power station to the turbines. To ensure underground ventilation, a tunnel connecting to the surface was also dug. In addition, the electricity generated underground must be sent to a substation on the surface for distribution. The project was not only complex, but the workers also had to constantly fight against various rocks, hard soil, and underground water torrents. However, all the difficulties could not intimidate the heroic working class of Bulgaria, and their hard work has blossomed today.

    Currently, three turbines have been installed in the machine room of the "Batak" Hydroelectric Power Station. They will process 130 million cubic meters of water annually, providing 112 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. The used water will be led through a three-kilometer-long tunnel to the "Batak" Reservoir, and then from this reservoir, the water will flow to the next tiered hydroelectric power station.

    The "Batak" underground hydroelectric power station is a new fruit of Bulgarian-Soviet friendship. The design and construction of this hydroelectric power station were completed with the help of Soviet experts, and the turbines were also supplied by the Soviet Union.

    Currently, Bulgarian hydroelectric power station engineers and workers are building the other two hydroelectric power stations, "Beshtara" and "Aleko," with even greater enthusiasm. The "Beshtara" Hydroelectric Power Station is now ready for installation. Its generating capacity is 120,000 kilowatts, exceeding the total generating capacity of all hydroelectric power stations in Bulgaria during the capitalist era. (Fang) (With picture)

### 保加利亚的地下水电站

    保加利亚的地下水电站
    保加利亚西南部的罗多彼地区的水利资源几乎占全国的40％。保加利亚已经投入生产的第一座地下水电站——“巴塔克”水电站就在这里。
    “巴塔克”水电站的整个系统包括四个水库和三个水电站：“巴塔克”、“别什捷拉”和“阿列科”，前两个水电站都建在地下。这三个电站每年平均的总发电量是六亿零五百万度，利用流过的水还可以灌溉四十余万狄卡尔土地（每一狄卡尔合我国一亩半）。完成这项工程共需挖七十八公里长的隧道和四十五公里长的沟渠。
    “巴塔克”水电站系统是阶梯式的，它的建设工程是从顶端的科拉罗夫水库开始的。这个水库在高达一千六百公尺的山地上，可容六千五百万立方公尺水。为了把水库的水引到“巴塔克”地下水电站，工人们要在岗陵起伏的山地下挖十二公里长的大隧道。
    这样长的大隧道，特别是还要使隧道通往“巴塔克”水电站的涡轮机，工程之难是可以想像得出的。首先要把水库中的水引到一百公尺高的水塔上，然后通过一千三百公尺长的地下钢管从比发电站高出四百二十公尺的地方流到涡轮机。为了保证地下通风还挖了一个同地面联系的隧道。此外，地下发出的电还要送到地面上的分站转发出去。工程不仅如此复杂，而且工人们还要在地下经常同各种岩石、硬土和地下水的激流作斗争。但是，一切的困难都吓不倒保加利亚英勇的工人阶级，他们辛勤的劳动今天已经开花结果了。
    目前，在“巴塔克”水电站的机器房里已经安装好了三台涡轮机，它们每年将通过一亿三千万立方公尺的水，可供应一亿一千二百万度的电力。这里用过的水将经过三公里长的隧道引到“巴塔克”水库里，然后水再从这个水库通到下面一个阶梯的水电站中去。
    “巴塔克”地下水电站是保苏友谊新的结晶。这个水电站的设计施工是在苏联专家的帮助下完成的，涡轮机也是苏联供应的。
    现在，保加利亚水电站的工程师和工人们正在以更大的热情修建另外两个水电站“别什捷拉”和“阿列科”。“别什捷拉”水电站现在已经准备安装工程了，它的发电能力是十二万瓩，超过了资本主义时代的保加利亚所有水电站的总发电能力。（方）（附图片）
