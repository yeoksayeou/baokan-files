From various newspapers:

　　Eliminate Gamblers
　　The Spring Festival is approaching, and many regions are paying attention to propaganda regarding changing customs, with particular emphasis on strictly prohibiting gambling. On February 11th, Zhejiang Daily published an editorial entitled "We Must Eliminate Gamblers," and reported that the Sheng County People's Court of the province was vigorously promoting the prohibition of gambling through the trials of gamblers. The editorial pointed out that gambling is a product of exploitative class society and a selfish, opportunistic behavior. Banning gambling is an important matter for conducting socialist education among the people and transforming social customs. On February 12th, Liaoning Daily also published on page three a message from the Liaoning People's Committee instructing all localities to strictly prohibit gambling during the Spring Festival.

    使赌徒绝迹
    春节将到，许多地区都注意了移风易俗的宣传，其中特别值得注意的是要严禁赌博。11日浙江日报发表了题为“一定要使赌徒绝迹”的社论，并发表了该省嵊县人民法院通过对赌徒的审判活动，大力宣传禁赌的消息。社论指出，赌博是剥削阶级社会的产物，是损人利己投机取巧的行为。禁赌是对人民进行社会主义教育，改造社会风气的一件重要事情。12日辽宁日报也在三版刊登了辽宁人民委员会指示各地春节期间严禁赌博的消息。
