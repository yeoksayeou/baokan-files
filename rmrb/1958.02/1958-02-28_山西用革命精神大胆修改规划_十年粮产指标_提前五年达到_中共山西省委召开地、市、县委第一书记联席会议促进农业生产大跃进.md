Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Telegram The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a joint conference of first secretaries of regional, municipal, and county party committees to revise agricultural development targets and prominently put forward that the leadership methods and style in rural areas must undergo a great leap forward to rapidly change the backward state of agricultural production in the province.

Encouraging leaps forward and opposing conservatism was the spirit that ran through the entire conference. The conference reviewed the province's grain production during the first Five-Year Plan period, published a comparative table classifying the rise and fall of grain, cotton, and oil crop production in various cities and counties over five years, and summarized the typical experiences of production leaps forward in various types of regions. Using these vivid facts, the conference criticized conservative thinking and launched ideological debates, enabling attendees to generally realize that solving the problems of leadership thinking and style is the first step in achieving a great leap forward in production, which is to resolutely change conservative and backward leadership methods and lead large-scale cooperative production with revolutionary spirit. Many people reflected that the conference was very successful, calling it a "thought resolution meeting" and a "style leap forward meeting," which greatly enhanced their determination and confidence in leaping forward.

When studying increased production targets and measures, the conference further implemented the spirit of encouraging leaps forward and opposing conservatism. Finally, it decided to make revolutionary and bold revisions to the original plan, putting forward inspiring slogans: achieving the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule and striving to "cross the Yangtze River" in ten years. It was required that by 1962, the average yield of grain crops per mu in the province should reach 400 jin, and by 1967, it should reach 600 jin, striving for most areas to reach 800 jin. This year is an important year for achieving the five-year and ten-year plans, requiring that the total grain output of the province break through the 10 billion jin mark, the yield per unit area break through 200 jin, and the yield of cotton per unit area break through 60 jin. Efforts should be made to have more than a dozen counties and cities where grain reaches 400 jin per mu and cotton reaches 100 jin per mu, and a large number of agricultural cooperatives where the grain yield per unit area reaches 400 jin to 1,000 jin. The plan is to raise 5 million pigs, increase large livestock by 150,000 to 200,000 heads, and increase sheep by 1 million. The plan is to afforest 4 million mu, carry out crash planting of 130 million walnut trees, and strive to have a large number of counties, cities, townships, and cooperatives carry out greening around houses and villages in one year, and require that more than one-third of the province's agricultural cooperatives exceed the level of wealthy middle peasants before local cooperation in terms of production and income.

In order to ensure the realization of the above leap forward targets, the conference decided to accelerate agricultural capital construction, requiring that major production increase measures such as water conservancy, soil and water conservation, and turning sloping land into terraced fields should all "be completed in three years of concentrated effort and two years of finishing touches, and basically completed in five years." This year, significant achievements must be made in water conservancy, fertilizer, and the universal promotion of agricultural technology and experience. The conference believes that the decisive link in changing the backward state of agriculture in Shanxi Province lies in improving leadership methods and style and improving the leadership level of rural work. Therefore, the conference particularly emphasized that in accordance with the new situation, it is necessary to continue to oppose conservative thinking, change the practice of leading agriculture in isolation and neglecting to strengthen cooperation between departments from an overall perspective. Change the practice of only paying attention to key points and neglecting overall work, oppose the practice of only praising and not criticizing key areas and agricultural cooperatives, and oppose continuing to be empty-headed politicians and lost pragmatists. Advocate strengthening political and ideological leadership in rural areas, secretaries studying production technology, changing from laymen to experts, and striving to become both red and expert leaders as soon as possible. The conference also promoted the experience of the Ping Shun County Party Committee going out of the office to tour rural areas, and advocated adopting new leadership methods such as cadre "experimental fields" and competitions, visits, and exhibitions.

    山西用革命精神大胆修改规划
    十年粮产指标　提前五年达到
    中共山西省委召开地、市、县委第一书记联席会议促进农业生产大跃进
    新华社太原电　中共山西省委最近召开地、市、县委第一书记联席会议，修订了农业发展指标，并且突出地提出了农村的领导方法和领导作风必须有个大跃进，以迅速改变全省农业生产的落后面貌。
    鼓励跃进，反对保守，是这次会议贯彻始终的精神。会议检查了第一个五年计划期间全省粮食生产情况，公布了各市、县的粮、棉、油料生产五年升降分类比较表，同时总结了各类地区生产跃进的典型经验，用这些活生生的事实批判保守思想，展开思想辩论，使到会的人普遍认识到：解决领导思想和领导作风的问题，是实现生产大跃进的第一步，就是决心改变保守落后的领导方法，以革命的气魄领导合作化大生产。许多人反映会议开的很好，说是“思想解决会”，“作风跃进会”，大大增强了跃进的决心和信心。
    会议在研究增产指标和增产措施的时候，进一步贯彻鼓励跃进反对保守的精神，最后决定把原订计划作革命的大胆的修改，提出振奋人心的口号；提前五年实现农业发展纲要规定指标，争取十年“过长江”。要求1962年全省粮食作物每亩平均达到四百斤，1967年达到六百斤，争取大部分地区达到八百斤。今年是实现五年和十年计划的重要年头，要求全省粮食总产量突破百亿斤大关，单位面积产量突破二百斤，棉花单位面积产量突破六十斤。争取出现十几个粮食每亩达到四百斤、棉花达到一百斤的县、市和大批粮食单位面积产量达到四百斤到一千斤的农业社。计划养猪五百万口，大牲畜增加十五万头到二十万头，羊增加一百万只。计划造林四百万亩，突击种植一亿三千万株核桃树，争取出现大批县、市、乡、社一年四旁绿化，并且要求全省三分之一以上的农业社生产和收入超过当地合作化前富裕中农的水平。
    为了保证实现上述跃进指标，会议除决定加速进行农业基本建设，要求水利、水土保持、坡地变梯田等主要增产措施，都要“三年突击，两年扫尾，五年基本完成”，今年突击抓水利、肥料和普遍推广农业技术经验，必须作出显著成绩。会议认为改变山西省农业落后面貌的决定环节在于改进领导方法和领导作风，提高农村工作的领导水平。因此，会议特别强调要根据新的形势，继续反对保守思想，改变孤立领导农业，忽视从全面出发加强各部门协作的作法。改变只注意重点，忽视全盘工作的作法，反对对重点地区和农业社只表扬不批评的作法，反对继续作空头政治家和迷失方向的实际家，提倡加强农村政治思想领导，书记钻研生产技术，变外行为内行，力争尽快变成又红又专的领导者。会议还推广平顺县委走出机关巡回农村办公的经验，并且提倡采取干部“试验田”和评比、参观、展览等新的领导方法。
