　　New "Worries"
    It is said that mapmakers have a kind of "worry": as soon as they print a "newest map," they are accused by readers of being "outdated." Because new cities have already appeared in places that were originally blank, and the railway lines that were originally indicated by dotted lines should now be replaced by solid lines...
    The "worries" of dictionary editors are probably no less, because new words are emerging endlessly. For example, you just compiled an entry for "eliminate the four pests," and then "eliminate the five pests," "eliminate the seven pests" appeared. For another example, according to the People's Daily of January 13, you have to add factories jointly operated by state, handicraft cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives with agricultural cooperatives after state-owned factories, local state-owned factories, and joint state-private factories under the entry of "factory." According to the People's Daily of January 16, you have to add "long-distance farming teams" to the explanation of the word "far"... At the same time, some words have lost their original meaning. For example, do we want words like "winter leisure" or not? If so, how should it be explained?
    The more of this new "worry" we have, the better! Even for those who are "worried," doesn't it add new work? (Huai)

### 新的“苦恼”

　　新的“苦恼”
    据说，编绘地图的人有一种“苦恼”：刚刚印制了一张“最新地图”，就被读者指责为“陈旧”。因为新的城市已经在那原是空白的地方出现了，原来用虚线表示的铁路线已经该用实线代替了……。
    编辑辞典的人的“苦恼”恐怕也未必少些，因为新鲜的词汇层出不穷。比方，你刚编写了一条“除四害”，又出现了“除五害”、“除七害”。再比方，根据1月13日的人民日报，你就得在“工厂”这一条下，在国营工厂、地方国营工厂、公私合营工厂后面，加上国家、手工业社、供销社同农业社合营的工厂。根据1月16日的人民日报，你又得在“远”字的解释里，加上“远耕队”这一条……。同时，有些词儿又失去了原有的意义。例如，像“冬闲”这样的词儿，究竟是要呢，还是不要？如果要，又该作何解释呢？
    这种新的“苦恼”越多对我们越好！即使对于“苦恼”者，不是又增加了新的工作吗？　（怀）
