    Errors of This Kind Should Be Avoided
    In the January 10th edition of the People's Daily, page seven, in the article "All Villagers in Lingdi Village, Zhejiang, are Literate," it was written: "Six years ago, only five people knew a few hundred characters. At that time, writing a letter or a short note meant running all over the village, and sometimes even going to other villages to ask someone to write it. In daily life, oil coupons were used as grain coupons, cloth coupons as rice coupons, and three yuan were used as one yuan. These kinds of jokes happened frequently."
    I have some questions about this paragraph. Six years ago, before 1952, our country had not yet implemented a unified purchase and sale policy for grain, and grain coupons were not yet in use. The use of cloth coupons came even later. At that time, there was no currency reform, so where did the "three yuan" Renminbi come from! I think this may be due to the author's lack of a realistic attitude in writing, and the editor's lack of carefulness in reviewing the manuscript. I hope to avoid such errors in the future.

    需要避免这类错误
    1月10日人民日报第七版“浙江岭地村都是识字人”一文中写道：“在六年前，只有五个人认识几百个字。那时，写封信、开张便条，都要跑遍全村，有时还要跑到外村去请别人写。在日常生活中，油证当粮证，布票当米票，三元的当一元用，这些笑话时有发生。”
    我对这一段有些疑问。六年前即1952年以前，我国还没有实行粮食统购统销政策，更没有使用粮证。使用布票那是更晚的事情了。那时也没有实行币制改革，哪里有“三元”的人民币呢！我认为这可能是该文作者的写作态度不够实事求是，而编辑同志在看稿时也不够仔细。希望今后避免这类错误。
