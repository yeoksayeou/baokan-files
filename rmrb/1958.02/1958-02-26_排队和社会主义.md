    Queuing and Socialism
    Zhong Huai
    In recent years, a prominent phenomenon in people's daily lives has been queuing. You have to queue to buy things, queue to eat at restaurants, queue to register for medical treatment, queue for a haircut, queue for plays and movies, queue for streetcars and buses, queue to buy train and boat tickets... Not only is there queuing, but the lines are very long, sometimes stretching from one street to another; and the time spent queuing is long, sometimes from midnight to dawn, or from early morning to afternoon.
    There are various views on this queuing phenomenon; truly, "the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom." Some people are moved by the scene and deeply lament "things are not what they used to be." In the past, you could buy whatever you wanted, unlike now! These people have their reasons. Isn't it precisely because most people had nothing in the past that their small group could have whatever they wanted? But let's not dwell on that. Some people believe that the increasing queuing phenomenon is a manifestation of the general improvement of people's lives and that production has not kept pace with the needs of life; it is a good thing, not a bad thing. They don't oppose queuing, but they are not happy to queue. They always hope to queue less and for shorter periods. However, some people equate "queuing" with socialism. "Queuing? This is socialism!" I once heard a commercial worker say this. Perhaps related to this idea, some stores, service industries, hospitals, and entertainment venues are indifferent to the queuing phenomenon, no matter how serious it is, and don't want to change it even slightly. There are even cases where the more people queue, the shorter the business or service hours are set. A certain boat ticket office requires you to queue in the morning to get a number and queue in the afternoon to buy a ticket, but the time for issuing numbers is only one hour. The internal medicine department of a certain hospital in Beijing is difficult to register with; sometimes you can't register for a month or two. On a certain day, you can register, but only for two hours—from 3 pm to 5 pm, and according to the staff, "not a minute early, not a minute late." Thus, before the time for issuing numbers and registering, a long line has already formed in front of these units, which is taken for granted.
    Is the superiority of socialism really manifested in this long line? One might doubt it. Recently, I saw a news item in the newspaper that resolved this doubt. The news said that units in Beijing that are closely related to people's lives, such as non-staple food stores, theaters, railway stations, and streetcar and bus companies, have already taken or are actively taking measures to improve their work and eliminate the phenomenon of queuing for purchases and rides. It is to eliminate the queuing phenomenon, not to maintain it, let alone develop it? How to eliminate it? By "actively taking measures to improve work." According to newspaper reports, units such as the Beifengwo Non-Staple Food Store have already taken various measures, such as adjusting working hours, adjusting labor organization, preparing for sales in advance, breaking certain outdated conventions... In fact, these measures can be summarized into one: to maximize convenience for customers.
    Comparing the practices of certain units mentioned earlier with the practices of the Beifengwo Non-Staple Food Store and other units, I realized that the difference lies in: the former tries to facilitate themselves, and for their own convenience, the customers' (or patients') queues can be as long and as long as possible; while the latter tries to facilitate customers as much as possible, and in order to reduce or eliminate queuing for customers, business hours can be set to "from morning to 11 pm," and the manager and accountant of the theater can participate in ticket sales, and the clerks selling general merchandise and fruits can participate in selling vegetables and meat in the morning...
    The issue is very clear. It turns out that the queuing phenomenon is indeed related to socialism, but how to treat the queuing phenomenon is also an issue related to socialism. Do you tolerate this queuing phenomenon and let it take its course? Or do you try to reduce and eliminate the queuing phenomenon? Isn't this a question of whether or not you have a socialist work attitude?
    If there are still people who, facing the long lines in front of them, say slowly and complacently, "Queuing? This is socialism!" I would like to ask them to use the Beifengwo Non-Staple Food Store and other units in Beijing as a mirror to reflect on themselves.

    排队和社会主义
    锺怀
    这几年来，在人们的日常生活中，有一种突出的现象，就是排队。买东西要排队，到饭馆吃饭要排队，看病挂号要排队，理发要排队，看戏、看电影要排队，搭电车、公共汽车要排队，买火车票、轮船票要排队……。不仅排队，而且队伍排得很长，有从一条街排到另一条街的；排队所花的时间很久，有从半夜排到天明，也有从清早排到下午的。
    对于这排队现象，有各种各样的看法，真是“仁者见仁，智者见智”。有人触景生情，深深慨叹“今不如昔”。过去要买什么有什么，那像现在！这种人自有他的道理。不正是因为过去大多数人要什么没有什么，他们那一小撮人才能要什么有什么吗？这里且不去多说。有人认为排队现象越来越多，这是人民生活普遍提高、生产的发展还赶不上生活的需要的表现，是好事不是坏事。他们不反对排队，可也不乐于排队。他们总希望能少排些队，排队的时间越短越好。不过，也有人在“排队”和社会主义之间划上了一个等号。“排队么？这是社会主义呀！”我就曾听到一个商业工作者这样说。大概同这种想法不无关系吧，有些商店、服务行业、医院、娱乐场所对于排队现象，不管它多么严重，也是无动于衷，不想去稍微改变一下的。甚至有这种事情：排队的人越多，它把营业或服务的时间规定得越短。某地轮船票发售所，卖船票要你上午去排队领牌子，下午去排队买票，而发牌子的时间却只有一个钟点。北京某医院的内科很难挂上号，有时候一两个月都不挂号，某日可以挂号了，但时间只有两小时——下午三点至五点，而且据工作人员说，“早一分钟也不给挂号，迟一分钟也不给挂号”。于是，还没有到发牌子和挂号的时间，在这些单位的门前，早已摆开了一字长蛇阵，就是理所当然的了。
    社会主义的优越性，果真就表现在这一字长蛇阵上么？叫人将信将疑。最近看到报上一条消息，才解决了这个疑问。那消息说，北京市与人民生活有密切关系的副食品商店、影剧院、火车站和电车、公共汽车公司等单位，已经或正在积极采取措施改进工作，消灭排队候购、候乘的现象。是要消灭排队现象，而不是保持，更不是发展排队现象？怎样消灭？就是“积极采取措施改进工作”。据报纸报道，北蜂窝副食品商店等单位已经采取了种种措施，例如调整工作时间，调整劳动组织，事先做好卖货的准备工作，打破某些陈规旧习……。而其实，这种种措施又可归纳为一条，就是尽量便利顾客。
    把前面谈的某些单位的做法同北蜂窝副食品商店等单位的做法一比，我这才发现它们的区别是在于：前者尽量便利自己，为了自己的方便，顾客（或病人）的队伍排得再长再久都无不可；而后者是尽量便利顾客，为了顾客少排队和不排队，营业时间可以规定为“从早晨到晚间十一点”，剧院的经理、会计可以参加售票，卖百货、水果的店员在早晨可以参加卖菜卖肉……。
    问题很明白了。原来排队现象固然是同社会主义有关联的，但是怎样对待排队现象，也是一个同社会主义有关联的问题。你是容忍这种排队现象、听其自然呢？还是设法减少和消灭排队现象呢？这难道不是一个有没有社会主义工作态度的问题？
    如果现在还有人面对着眼前的排得长长的队伍，慢条斯理、心安理得地说什么：“排队么，这是社会主义呀！”我倒要请他把北京市的北蜂窝副食品商店等单位当作镜子照一照自己。
