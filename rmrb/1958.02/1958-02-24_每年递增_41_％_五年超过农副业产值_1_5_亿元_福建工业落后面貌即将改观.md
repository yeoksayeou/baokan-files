Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 23rd: Fujian, with a relatively weak industrial base, is rapidly accelerating its pace to strive to increase the output value of local industries by 4.6 times within five years, exceeding the total output value of agricultural and sideline products. According to the revised plan recently formulated by the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, by 1962, the total output value of agricultural and sideline products in the province will be 335 million yuan, while the output value of local industries will increase from the current 63 million yuan to more than 3.5 billion yuan, leaping forward at an annual growth rate of 41%.

The plan requires that by 1962, the province should produce 300,000 tons of steel, 500,000 tons of pig iron, 2 million tons of iron ore, 1.2 million tons of coal, 400,000 tons of cement, 1 million cases of plate glass, and 5 million cubic meters of timber. At present, the preparatory work for an iron and steel complex with an annual output of 200,000 tons and a large fertilizer plant is underway. A total of ten large and small chemical fertilizer plants and pesticide plants will be built within five years, and most counties will also run their own small mixed fertilizer plants. By 1962, the province will produce 600,000 tons of chemical fertilizer annually. As for pesticides, self-sufficiency will be achieved within five years. Machine factories in various regions will produce large quantities of agricultural and forestry machinery suitable for the mountainous areas of Fujian, as well as small power generation equipment.

Fujian is concentrating its efforts to strive to complete the construction of the Gutian Stream three-stage power station and the Yongding Stream hydropower station within five years, and to begin the construction of hydropower stations on the main stream of the Minjiang River. The power generation in 1962 will reach approximately 1 billion kilowatt-hours. During the second five-year plan period, the masses will also be mobilized to raise funds to build 6,000 small power stations (including 5,000 hydropower stations in mountainous areas and 1,000 biogas power stations in plains). In the future, more than one-third of the agricultural cooperatives in the province will have power stations.

Fujian will also vigorously develop the food industry, papermaking industry, and textile industry within five years.

    每年递增41％　五年超过农副业产值1.5亿元
    福建工业落后面貌即将改观
    据新华社福州23日电　工业基础相当薄弱的福建，正在快马加鞭，争取在五年内使地方工业产值增长四·六倍，超过农副业的总产值。根据中共福建省委最近的修正规划，到1962年，全省农副业总产值是三三·五亿元，而地方工业的产值要从现在的六·三亿元增加到三十五亿元以上，以每年递增41％的速度跃进。
    规划要求，到1962年要生产钢三十万吨，生铁五十万吨，铁矿石二百万吨，煤炭一百二十万吨，水泥四十万吨，平板玻璃一百万箱，伐木五百万立方公尺。目前一座年产二十万吨的钢铁联合企业和一座大型肥料厂的筹建工作正在紧张进行。五年内修建的大小化学肥料厂及农药厂共有十座，大部分县也要自办小型混合肥料厂。到1962年全省将年产化肥六十万吨。至于农药，五年内要做到全部自给。各地机器厂将大量生产适合于福建山地的各种农业林业的机械以及小型发电设备。
    福建正集中力量力争五年内把古田溪三级发电站和永定溪水电站全部建成，并开始修建闽江干流的水力发电站。1962年发电量将达到十亿度左右。在第二个五年计划期间，还要发动群众集资修建小型发电站六千个（其中山区修建水力发电站五千个，平原兴建沼气电站一千个）。将来全省三分之一以上的农业社都有发电站。
    福建五年内还要大力发展食品工业、造纸工业和纺织工业。
