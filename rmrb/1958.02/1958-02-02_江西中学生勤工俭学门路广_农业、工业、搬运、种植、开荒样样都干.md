Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 1st: Many middle school students in Jiangxi are persisting in work-study programs, achieving a balance of part-time work and part-time study.

　　Jiangxi province's middle school students have a wide range of avenues for work-study. Rural students use their winter and summer vacations and Spring Festival to return home and participate in agricultural cooperative labor. Urban students participate in basic construction or transportation department labor during holidays, and some participate in school-organized laundry, barbering, planting, land reclamation groups, or various voluntary labor within the school.

　　The students use their labor income as their own study expenses or donate it to the school for construction expenses. Some students at Zhangshu Middle School who participate in the odd jobs and transportation groups have difficult family finances, so they use the remuneration they receive for doing odd jobs for the school and transporting building materials to pay their tuition and food expenses. More than 300 students at this school participated in labor at construction sites during last year's busy farming holiday. They donated the more than 200 yuan they received to the school to buy political textbooks. Some students at Fengcheng Junior High School weave bamboo baskets for agricultural cooperatives in their spare time, earning ten yuan per month per person. Their tuition and living expenses can be completely covered without family burden or scholarship assistance.

　　江西中学生勤工俭学门路广
    农业、工业、搬运、种植、开荒样样都干
    据新华社南昌1日电　江西有不少中学生坚持勤工俭学，作到半工半读。
    江西省中学生勤工俭学的门路很广。农村的学生利用寒、暑假和春节回家参加农业社劳动。城市的学生在假日参加基本建设或搬运部门劳动，有的参加学校组织的洗衣、理发、种植、开荒等小组或校内各项义务劳动。
    学生们把他们的劳动所得，作为自己的学习费用或献给学校作建设费用。樟树中学参加勤杂组和搬运组的部分学生家庭经济困难，他们就把给学校做零工和搬运建筑材料得来的报酬交了学费和伙食费。这个学校三百多学生在去年农忙假时参加了建筑工地的劳动。他们把得到的二百多元报酬，献给了学校买政治课教材。丰城初中有些学生在课余时间为农业社编织篾篓，每人每月能收入十元。他们的学费和生活费可以完全不用家庭负担和助学金补助。
