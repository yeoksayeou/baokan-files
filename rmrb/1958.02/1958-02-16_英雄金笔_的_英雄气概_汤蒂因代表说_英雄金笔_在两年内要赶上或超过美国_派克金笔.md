    With extreme excitement, I listened to the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and I express my heartfelt support.
    I would like to talk about the new leap forward and new atmosphere of our Shanghai Joint State-Private Hua Fu Gold Pen Factory on the production front in 1958.
    The quality of our country's gold pens has long surpassed those of Britain and Japan. The current issue is to catch up with the United States and surpass "Parker."
    Since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the inspiring great call to "catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer," it has greatly encouraged the revolutionary drive in our factory. Under the leadership of the Party, all the workers and staff of the factory put forward that the "Hero Gold Pen" should use "heroic spirit" to catch up with or surpass the American "Parker Gold Pen" in two to four years. After this bold call was sounded, the masses were in full swing, beating gongs and drums, and congratulating each other. All workshops and departments put forward guarantees, and everyone expressed their determination. Recently, under the encouragement of the nationwide Great Leap Forward situation, the targets were revised again, and it was determined that the American Parker Gold Pen must be caught up with or surpassed within two years. A new upsurge of "catching up with the United States and surpassing Parker" has been set off throughout the factory, greatly promoting the new leap forward on the production front in 1958.
    Some people ask: It will take fifteen years to catch up with Britain now, but you want to catch up with the United States in two years. Is it possible? We answer: "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it." As long as we have determination and drive, it is definitely possible. As for why we don't catch up with Britain first but catch up with the United States first, the question is very simple. Because British pens have always been beneath our notice. The United States has always dominated the international market, followed by Japan. China's gold pens used to be relatively backward. Some people criticized us for being "cold pens," saying they leaked ink like a runny nose, and saying they were "paper-cutting pens," saying the nibs would cut through the paper when writing, etc. There were many shortcomings. In the winter of 1955, when we carried out a major joint operation in the entire industry, we made a guarantee to "reach international standards in product quality within three years." Under the leadership of the Party and the joint efforts of the staff and workers, we achieved this goal "within two years" ahead of schedule. Now our gold pens have left Japan behind in terms of the quality of their use value. Currently, our only strong enemy is the United States. This year, we further propose to catch up with or surpass "Parker" within two years, which is entirely possible. Of course, we cannot just talk empty words. We should analyze the specific objective and subjective conditions in a realistic way. Only in this way can we have full confidence and catch up.
    First of all, from a technical point of view, we say that the quality of a pen is mainly measured in two aspects: use value and appearance. Therefore, the "Hero Gold Pen" is also prepared to compete with the "Parker Gold Pen" in two steps.

    Catch up with "Parker" in use value
    The ink flows smoothly and does not leak. The water leakage temperature difference of "Parker" is 30 to 35 degrees Celsius. After improvement, the average water leakage temperature difference of "Hero Gold Pen" has reached 27.6 degrees, and it will soon catch up with "Parker".

    The first step is in terms of use value. There are mainly two key issues: smooth ink flow and no leakage; the nib should be wear-resistant, smooth, and fine. So what is the difference between us and "Parker" at present? The average water leakage temperature difference of "Parker" is currently 30 to 35 degrees Celsius, which means that a pen can adapt to temperature changes within 30 to 35 degrees without leaking water. In the past, the average water leakage temperature difference of the "Hero Gold Pen" was only about 16 degrees. That is, when the temperature suddenly changes by about 16 degrees (for example: it is too hot to be hidden on the body; writing immediately after running from cold air into a heated room; writing immediately after washing hands with hot water; writing for a long time and the pen holder is too hot, or there is too little ink in the holder, etc.), the air inside the pen holder will expand, and there will be pressure to cause the ink to leak uncontrollably. For such problems, for more than 20 years in the past, it has not been fundamentally resolved. After the major joint operation in the entire industry, the professional company concentrated the technical force and focused on systematically analyzing this problem, and then found out that the leakage problem mainly lies in the organization of the capillary. Due to the theoretical mastery of its performance, through continuous research, on the one hand, the structure of the water storage device was improved, and the amount of water storage in the grooves of the pen section and the pen tongue was increased (like building a reservoir, it can play a water storage role when floods break out), and on the other hand, the heat insulation and air return structure inside the pen holder were improved, etc. Now the average water leakage temperature difference of the "Hero Gold Pen" has reached 27.6 degrees, and the highest can reach 30 degrees. Small-batch trial production has recently reached 34 degrees, and it will soon catch up with "Parker."
    The nib is wear-resistant, smooth, and fine. The nib grinding operation of the "Hero Gold Pen" has been changed from manual to machine operation, truly achieving "five-sided smoothness," and the thickness standards can also be fixed.

    "Parker" nibs are wear-resistant and smooth, and can be graded by thickness. In the past, the nib grinding of the "Hero Gold Pen" was entirely manual. Due to the quality of the workers' skills, the quality could vary greatly, and manual operation made the force uneven, which often affected the stability of the quality. As for the thickness, it can only be left to nature and there can be no fixed standard. Recently, our deputy director and technicians jointly researched and trial-produced a set of machines that can completely free nib grinding from manual operation. In this way, the nibs that are ground out truly achieve "five-sided smoothness." Because the machine can be adjusted and controlled, the thickness can also be divided into three grades: "general, fine, and finest." In this way, we are confident that we can catch up with "Parker." Now our most difficult problem is the wear resistance of the nib. According to general usage: "Parker" will only deform (thicken) after more than five years of use, while "Hero" will deform after two years. The reason is mainly the iridium grain on the nib. We have always had to rely on imports, and the quality of the imperialists is not guaranteed. From the imported iridium grains, we analyzed that there is very little iridium or even no iridium content at all. In order to fundamentally solve this problem, after the major joint operation in the entire industry, we established the Shanghai Iridium Grain Factory. This was reorganized from a mess that could only reproduce iridium grains from recycled waste iridium powder, so the technical and equipment conditions were very poor. Now, thanks to the strong support of Shanghai Bulb Factory and other related units in the analysis of non-ferrous metal technology, the problems that we originally had to explore for many years have now been solved, and we are already able to create iridium grains ourselves from imports. Of course, it will take some time to reach the requirements of "Parker" pens in terms of quality. However, we are fully confident.

    Overwhelm "Parker" in appearance
    "Parker" is gold-plated, not easy to fade, "Hero" is gold-plated, easy to fade. In terms of appearance, our goal is not only to catch up, but we must overwhelm "Parker" and make "world champion gold pens."

    The second step is from the appearance. Now the "Hero" gold pen and the "Parker" gold pen are almost similar. It's just that the quality of the gold sleeve is poor. We are gold-plated and easy to fade. "Parker" pens are gold-plated. This is not a major issue in the domestic market, but it is very important in the international market. Therefore, we must also strive to catch up in this regard. Our goal is not only to catch up with "Parker," but more importantly, to surpass it. We must give play to our creativity and take the initiative to propose our own specifications. Within two years, we must overwhelm "Parker." Let our own "world champion gold pens" be able to stand tall and proud in the international market! Now, we are doing the great cause of "competing with imperialism for time and speed." This is a glorious task and also an arduous task. There are still many difficulties in front of us. However, we say: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, no difficulty can scare us. As Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, "We must fully recognize the great role of human factors and political factors, and we must fully recognize the great role of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people under the new socialist relations of production. Fully recognizing these roles will enable us to maintain full confidence, determination, and revolutionary drive in the face of any difficulties." This is our most fundamental condition and also our most reliable guarantee.

    Before liberation, domestically produced gold pens suffered all kinds of exclusion and destruction. Now our products are welcomed in the international market. The different experiences of a small gold pen fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

    Recalling the history of our domestically produced gold pens, it has also been about thirty years. However, the experience of more than 20 years before liberation was tragic. Imperialism occupied our market, causing us to suffer all kinds of exclusion. I remember that when the Golden Star Gold Pen Factory was opened, it hoped that Golden Star gold pens could be sold in Wing On Company (because at that time, if a certain product was sold in Wing On Company, it would be worth more). They tried every means to get in, and finally accepted "consignment sales," but if no one or very few people asked about it within a certain period of time, it would be returned. The person in charge of the Golden Star factory used the "bitter meat trick" and sent people to Wing On Company every day to buy back their own products. In this way, the company felt that the sales were not bad, so they gradually purchased goods. Later, mainly due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, which aroused the patriotic enthusiasm of the people, domestically produced gold pens gradually emerged. However, when imperialism dumped goods in large quantities, it could suppress us at any time so that we could not breathe. In addition, the exploitation of bureaucratic capital was also all-pervasive. For example: when they "set prices" to plunder gold, even our industrial raw materials could not be spared. At the eve of liberation, gold pen factories were not even left with one tael of gold. The Kuomintang reactionary rule destroyed our national industry in this way.
    Under capitalist management, the industry was also "big fish eat small fish" and "small fish eat shrimps," competing and squeezing each other. As for if this factory had a new piece of equipment, or that factory had a good experience, it would be like a "secret" that could not be leaked. Therefore, the industry has always adhered to conventions. For quality, they could only "leave it to fate"; for colors and patterns, they were content with the status quo. There has been little progress in more than 20 years. Many factories were precarious and could not be guaranteed, let alone developed.

    After liberation, fundamental changes took place. The clutches of imperialist aggression were cut off. The needs of the people are growing day by day. Under the vigorous support of the Party and the government, we were able to get rid of difficulties and have unprecedented development. Especially after the major joint operation in the entire industry, the appearance of enterprises is changing every day. After economic reorganization, "advanced ones brought along backward ones." Small factories that were scattered, backward, and in difficulty were merged into large factories. From then on, it was no longer "big fish eat small fish," but "large ships bring small boats" to enter socialism together. In the past, colleagues were like enemies. Now, under the unified leadership of the Pen Manufacturing Industry Company, they have become a family. In the past, technologies, equipment, operations, and experiences that were unwilling to be made public are now organized by professional companies to gather the advanced technical forces of various factories to conduct centralized research and analysis, and exchange and promote them at any time. Due to the change in production relations, the enthusiasm of the staff and workers has become greater and greater, which has made it possible to quickly solve problems that could not be solved for many years in the past. Things that were thought to be impossible to do in the past can now be done. In the past, we were at risk of being forced to stop work and close factories at any time due to the dumping of imperialism, but now our products can be exported and are welcomed in the international market. Not only that, but now we are going to catch up with or surpass "Parker" in two years. This is something we never dared to imagine when we first started our own factories. This is such a great and encouraging thing! It makes me deeply realize that this is only possible under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao; this is only possible under the great power of the working masses. From a small gold pen, in two completely different societies and two completely different experiences, this vivid contrast fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. This is an iron fact, and we forcefully refute the fallacies of the right-wingers that "socialist competitions only have one diary and one big red flower, and there is no motivation. It is not as good as capitalism, which rewards bravery and has motivation." The strong vitality of the socialist system is the source of endless motivation itself. Socialism will inevitably overwhelm capitalism, and capitalism will definitely be left far behind us and will never catch up with socialism again. This truth can also be found from a small gold pen.
    Fellow representatives! We are in such a momentous and extraordinary moment. Each of us is full of confidence and hope for our magnificent future. As a national bourgeois, I am also determined to be with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party and the working class, to go all out and strive for the top! I must work harder, continue to transform myself, and humbly learn from the workers and peasants. I must transform myself through labor practice and exercise to become a truly self-reliant worker, and strive to contribute to the cause of socialist construction!
    The above is my personal superficial understanding. Please criticize and correct me.

    “英雄金笔”的“英雄气概”
    汤蒂因代表说“英雄金笔”在两年内要赶上或超过美国“派克金笔”
    我以万分兴奋的心情，听了李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理和吴玉章主任的各项报告，表示衷心地拥护。
    我想谈谈一九五八年我们上海公私合营华孚金笔在生产战线上的新跃进、新气象。
    我国金笔的质量早已超过英国、日本，现在的问题是要赶上美国，压倒“派克”。
    自从党中央和毛主席提出了“在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国”这一个振奋人心的伟大号召，大大地鼓舞了我们厂内的革命干劲。在党的领导下，全厂职工提出了“英雄金笔”要以“英雄气概”在两至四年内赶上或者超过美国“派克金笔”。当这个豪迈的号角吹响以后，群众热火朝天，敲锣打鼓，互相报喜，各个车间、科室纷纷提出了保证，每个人都表示了决心，最近在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞下，又经过修改了指标，确定在两年内一定要赶上或超过美国派克金笔。全厂已经掀起了一个“赶上美国，压倒派克”的新高潮。大大促进了一九五八年生产战线上的新跃进。
    有人问：现在赶英国尚且要十五年，你们却在两年要赶美国，可能吗？我们回答：“世界无难事，只怕有心人”。只要我们有决心、有干劲，肯定有可能。至于为什么我们不赶英国而先赶美国？问题很简单。因为英国的笔一向不在我们话下，在国际市场上向来称霸的是美国，其次是日本。我们中国的金笔，过去是比较落后的，曾经有人批评我们是“伤风笔”，说像流鼻涕一样的漏墨水，说是“割纸笔”，写起字来笔尖会割破纸张……等，缺点很多。一九五五年冬我们在全行业大合营时，曾经提出“要在三年内把产品质量达到国际水平”的保证。在党的领导下，职工同志的共同努力，已提前“在两年内”达到了这个目标。现在我们的金笔，在使用价值的质量方面已把日本抛在后面了。目前唯一的劲敌就是美国。今年我们进一步提出在两年内要赶上或超过“派克”，完全有可能的。当然，我们不能空口说白话，应该实事求是来分析主客观的具体条件。这样才能信心百倍，迎头赶上。
    首先从技术条件来看，我们说衡量一支笔的好坏，主要是两个方面：使用价值和外观形式。因此“英雄金笔”也准备分两步进行与“派克金笔”来竞赛。
    使用价值赶上“派克”
    出水流畅，不要漏水。“派克”的漏水温差是摄氏三十到三十五度。经过改进，“英雄金笔”的漏水温差平均已到二十七点六度，很快即可赶上“派克”。
    第一步，在使用价值方面。主要是两个关键问题：出水流畅，不要漏水；笔尖耐磨，而要细滑。那么目前与“派克”的差别如何呢？“派克”的漏水温差现在平均是摄氏三十度至三十五度，也就是一枝笔可以适应温度变化在三十度至三十五度内不会漏水。过去“英雄金笔”的漏水温差平均只有十六度左右。那就在温度突然发生十六度左右变化时（例如：藏在身边太热；从冷空气中一跑到有暖气的房内就写字；刚用热水洗完手就写字；写得时间长了，笔杆捏得太热，或者杆内墨水过少的时候等等原因），都会使笔杆内部空气膨胀，就有压力使墨水不能自主的漏出来。对于这样的问题，过去二十多年来，一直没有从根本来解决过。全行业大合营后，专业公司集中组织了技术力量，着重对此作了系统分析，才摸出了漏水问题主要在于毛细管的组织作用。由于理论上掌握了它的性能，经过不断研究，一方面改进了储水器的结构，使笔项和笔舌的缝槽内增加储水量（像筑水库一样，可以在洪水暴发时起储水作用），一方面改进了笔杆内的隔热、回气结构等等措施。现在“英雄金笔”的漏水温差平均达到二十七点六度，高的可达三十度，最近小批试制已达到三十四度，很快可以赶上“派克”。
    笔尖耐磨细滑。“英雄金笔”磨笔尖的操作已由人工改用机器操作，真正做到“五面光滑”，粗细标准也能固定。
    “派克”的笔尖耐磨而细滑，并且可以粗细分档。“英雄金笔”过去磨笔尖完全是手工操作。由于工人技术的好坏，使质量可以相差很大，而且手工操作使力不均衡，往往影响质量的稳定。至于粗细也只能听其自然，不能有固定的标准。最近我们一位副厂长和技术人员共同研究试制了一套机器，可以使磨笔尖完全摆脱手工操作。这样，磨出来的笔尖，真正做到“五面光滑”。由于机器可以调整控制，也可以把粗细分成“一般、细、最细”三档。这样也就有把握可以赶上“派克”了。现在我们最困难的问题在于笔尖的耐磨程度。根据一般使用情况：“派克”用了五年以上才会变形（发粗），而“英雄”用了两年就要变形。其原因主要是笔尖上的一粒铱金。我们一向要靠进口，而帝国主义的品质没有保障，我们从进口的铱粒来分析，里面根本很少铱甚至没有铱的成分。为了根本解决这个问题，在全行业大合营以后，我们成立了上海铱粒厂。这是以一个过去只能从回收废料铱粉而复制铱粒的一个烂摊子来进行改组的，因此技术、设备条件都很差。现在由于上海灯泡厂等有关单位，在关于分析有色金属的技术方面，给我们大力支持，使我们原来自己要摸索好多年的问题，现在已得到解决，已经能够从进口到自己来创造铱粒了。当然质量要达到“派克”笔的要求，还需要一定时间的努力。但是，我们是完全有信心的。
    外观形式压倒“派克”
    “派克”是包金，不易褪色，“英雄”是镀金，容易褪色。在外观方面，我们的目标是不仅要赶上，而且一定要压倒“派克”，做出“世界冠军金笔”。
    第二步，从外观形式方面。现在“英雄”金笔与“派克”金笔几乎可以接近。只是金套的质量较差，我们是镀金，容易褪色，“派克”笔是包金，在国内市场这虽不是什么重要问题，但在国际市场上是很讲究的。因此在这方面我们也必需努力赶上去。我们的目标不仅是要赶上“派克”，而更重要的是还要超过它。我们必需发挥创造性，要主动的提出我们自己的规格。在两年内我们一定要压倒“派克”。让我们自己做出来的“世界冠军金笔”可以在国际市场上扬眉吐气！现在，我们正在干“同帝国主义争时间比速度”的伟大事业。这是光荣的任务，也是艰巨的任务，摆在我们面前还有不少困难。但是，我们说：在共产党和毛主席的领导下，任何困难都吓不倒我们。李先念副总理所说“必须充分认识到人的因素、政治的因素的伟大作用，必须充分地认识到劳动人民在新的社会主义生产关系下的革命积极性的伟大作用。充分地认识到这些作用，就会使我们在任何困难面前都能保持充分的信心、坚定性和革命的干劲。”这就是我们最根本的条件，也是我们最可靠的保证。
    解放前国产金笔受尽了排挤和摧残。现在我们的产品在国际市场上受到了欢迎。从一枝小小的金笔的不同的遭遇充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    回忆我们国产金笔问世以来，也有三十年左右的历史。可是，在解放前二十余年的经历是悲惨的。帝国主义霸占我们的市场，使我们受尽了排挤。记得金星金笔厂在开办时希望金星金笔能够在永安公司经销（因为当时某一种产品，如果在永安公司销售，那就身价不同了）。他们千方百计走了门路，总算接受了“寄售”，可是，如果在一定时间内，没有人或者很少人问津，就要退回去的。金星厂的负责人用了“苦肉计”，每天陆续派人到永安公司把自己的产品买回来。这样公司觉得销路还不错，就陆续进货。后来主要由于抗日战争开始，激起了人民的爱国热情，国产金笔才逐步抬头。可是当帝国主义大量倾销时，随时可以压得我们透不过气来。加上官僚资本的搜刮也是无孔不入。例如：他们“限价”搜刮黄金时竟连我们工业原料也不能幸免。在解放前夕的金笔厂，甚至连一两黄金也不给留下。国民党反动统治，就是这样摧残我们民族工业。
    在资本主义的经营下，同行也是“大鱼吃小鱼”“小鱼吃虾米”，互相竞争倾轧。至于这个厂有了一样新的设备，或者那个厂有了一个好的经验，那就会像“天机”一样不可泄漏。因此行业间一向墨守成规。对于质量只能“听天由命”；对于花色而是故步自封。二十多年来很少进步。好些工厂朝不保夕，得不到保障，更谈不上发展。
    解放后，起了根本的变化。帝国主义侵略的魔爪斩断了。人民的需要日益增长。在党和政府的大力扶植下，使我们摆脱了困难，而且有了空前的发展。特别是在全行业大合营后，企业的面貌天天在发生变化。经过经济改组，“先进带落后”。把分散、落后、困难的小厂并入了大厂。从此不再是“大鱼吃小鱼”，而是“大船带了小船”共同进入社会主义。过去同行如冤家。现在在制笔工业公司统一领导下，变成了一家人。过去不肯公开的技术、设备、操作、经验，现在由专业公司组织了各厂的先进技术力量，集中研究分析，随时交流推广。由于生产关系的改变，职工群众的劲头越来越大了，就使得过去多少年不能解决的问题，很快就解决了。过去认为没有办法做到的事情，现在可以做到了。过去我们随时有被帝国主义的倾销被迫停工关厂的危险，而现在我们的产品可以出口，在国际市场上受到了欢迎。还不仅如此，现在我们竟然在两年内要赶上或超过“派克”了，这真是我们当初自己办工厂时，做梦也不敢想像的。这是多么值得欢欣鼓舞的一件大事情！使我深深体会到：这只有在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下才有这样可能；这只有在工人群众发挥了巨大的威力下才有这样可能。从一枝小小的金笔，在两个不同社会制度下两个完全不同的遭遇，这样鲜明的对比，充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。这是铁的事实，我们有力地把右派分子“社会主义竞赛只有一本日记本、一朵大红花，没有动力。不如资本主义重赏之下必有勇夫有动力”的谰言，驳斥得体无完肤。社会主义制度的强大生命力，它本身就是无穷无尽一切动力的泉源。社会主义必然压倒资本主义，而资本主义肯定将远远抛在我们后面，永远再也赶不上社会主义。从一枝小小的金笔上，也完全可以找出这一个真理。
    各位代表！我们正处在这样惊天动地不平凡的时刻里，我们每一个人对我们壮丽的未来都充满着信心和希望。我作为一个民族资产阶级分子，也坚决与全国人民在一起，在党和工人阶级的领导下，要鼓足干劲，力争上游！我一定要加倍努力，继续改造自己，虚心向工农群众学习，要通过劳动实践和锻炼，使自己脱胎换骨改造成为真正自食其力的劳动者；为能够很好地为社会主义建设事业贡献力量而努力！
    以上是我个人粗浅的体会，请代表们批评指正。
