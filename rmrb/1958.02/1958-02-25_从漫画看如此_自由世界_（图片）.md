A Look at the "Free World" Through Cartoons

    Landlords Fierce as Lions
    Ignoring fierce opposition from the people, the British government abolished the Rent Control Act last year, allowing landlords to raise rents at any time. Many tenants who could not afford the rent were evicted onto the streets. (Originally published in the British "Worker's Daily")

    "Time for Civics Class!"
    In schools in Little Rock, USA, Ku Klux Klan members use terror tactics to threaten Black students who demand to enjoy civic education.
        (Originally published in the French "l'Humanité")

    Machines Steal Jobs
    In capitalist countries, the automation of production and advancements in industrial technology do not bring happiness to workers; instead, they cause more workers to lose their jobs. An American cartoonist vividly portrays this scene.
        (Originally published in the British "World News")

    The Tortoise and the Hare
    The British government's policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war has caused inflation and a sharp rise in prices. However, the British government continues to implement a policy of freezing wages, and the distance between wages and prices is growing ever wider. (Originally published in the British "World News")

    从漫画看如此“自由世界”
    房东猛如狮
    英国政府不顾人民激烈反对，于去年废除房租管制法案，使房东可以随时高抬租金。许多付不起房租的住户被驱逐街头。（原载英国“工人日报”）
    “上公民课了！”
    在美国小石城的学校里，三K党徒用恐怖手段威胁要求享受公民教育的黑人学生。
          （原载法国“人道报”）
    机器抢人饭碗
    在资本主义国家，生产的自动化和工业技术的进步并不能给工人带来幸福，反而使更多的工人失业。一个美国漫画家生动地刻画了这种情景。
        （原载英国“世界新闻”）
    龟兔赛跑
    英国政府执行扩军备战政策，引起通货膨胀，物价猛烈上涨。但是英国政府却继续实行冻结工资的政策，工资和物价的距离越来越远。（原载英国“世界新闻”）
