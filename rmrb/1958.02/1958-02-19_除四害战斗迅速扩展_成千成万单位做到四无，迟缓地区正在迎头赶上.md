Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The nationwide patriotic health campaign, centered on eliminating the four pests, is rapidly developing in depth across the country and has already achieved tremendous successes. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-five provinces (autonomous regions) and cities, a total of more than 300 million rats and sparrows have been eliminated, along with over 246,000 catties and 4.54 million boxes of mosquitoes and flies. 3.392 million catties of fly pupae have been dug up, and tens of millions of tons of garbage have been cleared, improving sanitary conditions in urban and rural areas.

Since the people of the capital launched the "Eliminate Four Pests, Emphasize Hygiene" competition in mid-January, 6,320 "Four-Withouts" areas and units, encompassing 1.6 million people, have emerged by February 10th. In Shanghai, since the launch of a concentrated campaign to eliminate the seven pests two months ago, 840,000 "Four-Withouts" households and more than 7,600 "Four-Withouts" units have appeared throughout the city, accounting for about 60% of the city's total households. Starting February 13th, more than 1,000 Party and government leaders, as well as citizen representatives and members of the CPPCC, formed more than 150 inspection teams to conduct a four-day major inspection, followed by a city-wide general appraisal. In Guangzhou, since the launch of the health campaign on New Year's Day this year, inspections of more than 280,000 households have shown that 240,000 households have reached the standard of "Six-Withouts" – no garbage, no dust, no feces, no sewage, no sputum, and no filth. Now, citizens are beginning to clean up the sewers.

In Anhui Province, the number of people participating in the elimination of the four pests has reached about 18 million. More than 200 "Four-Withouts" units and areas have emerged throughout the province, and sparrows have been basically eliminated in villages along railways and highways. According to statistics from Henan Province up to the end of January, more than 5.8 million rats and sparrows have been eliminated, nearly 1,000 catties of overwintering mosquitoes and flies have been eliminated, more than 290,000 catties of fly pupae have been dug up, and more than 70 million cartloads of fertilizer have been accumulated. In Jiangsu Province, from the start of the campaign in mid-December last year to February 7th, about 15.4 million rats and sparrows, and more than 1,300 catties of mosquitoes and flies, have been eliminated, and 249,000 catties of fly pupae have been dug up. In Sichuan Province, 30 million people participated in the sanitation campaign "Shock Month" starting in January, and by February 12th, more than 16.7 million rats and sparrows, and 110,000 catties of mosquitoes, flies, mosquito larvae, and maggots had been eliminated. In Fujian Province, Nanping Prefecture eliminated more than 3.32 million rats and sparrows in one month, with Jianning County averaging more than five rats caught per person. Since the winter of last year, 18 million young people in Shandong Province have invested in the patriotic health campaign. They have organized about 120,000 shock teams, reconnaissance teams, and combat teams to eliminate the four pests, and have widely launched competition and appraisal activities. Many advanced units in sanitation work have emerged in Jiangxi Province. More than 90% of the units in Jiujiang City are free of mosquitoes and flies, and clean households in Nanchang City have reached 93% of the city's total households. In the mountainous area of Wushan County in Gansu Province, the Nanshan area used to be "manure eaten by pigs, urine dries naturally, dust covers the sky," but now 33 villages have reached the "Four-Withouts" standard, and environmental sanitation has been greatly improved.

Some areas where the health campaign started later and developed unevenly are now accelerating their pace to catch up. In Liaoning Province, a new upsurge has formed before the Spring Festival. Throughout the province, a new district, twenty-four townships, nine streets, two villages, five production team cooperatives, and seventy-five neighborhood committees with "One-Withouts" to "Four-Withouts" have emerged. Hubei Province has eliminated counties and cities that were previously blank in the elimination of the four pests, and 1,120 bends and eighteen townships have basically achieved the "Four-Withouts". The thirty-nine counties in Guizhou Province, where progress was relatively slow, have also quickly taken action. Jinsha County, located in a high-altitude mountainous area, has seen the emergence of eight townships without rats or sparrows. In Yunnan Province, 83% of the counties and cities have also taken action, and various localities are changing the situation where the campaign remains only in county towns and market towns. The sanitary appearance of Hohhot City has been greatly improved, and no garbage can be seen in the city's streets and alleys.

In carrying out the patriotic health campaign, various localities are constantly criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking and revising plans for eliminating the four pests. Dalian City has decided to achieve "Six-Withouts, Seven-Cleans" this year – no flies, no mosquitoes, no rats, no sparrows, no cockroaches, no bedbugs, and clean indoors, clean courtyards, clean streets, clean public places, clean tableware, clean clothes, and clean bedding. Zhengzhou City, Xuchang City, and Dengfeng County in Henan Province are determined to become "Four-Withouts" cities and counties in the first half of this year. Luoyang, Kaifeng, Jiaozuo, and other cities plan to reach the "Four-Withouts" standard this year, and the Kaifeng Prefectural Committee of the CPC has also put forward the slogan of creating the first "Four-Withouts" prefecture in Henan this year. Nanjing, Wuxi, Xuzhou City, and Wujiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, Yizheng, Shuyang, Taicang, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and other counties and cities in Jiangsu Province have decided to eliminate the four pests this year. Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing and other cities in Zhejiang Province have decided to eliminate the four pests in one to two years. The people of Yan'an County in Shaanxi Province have proposed to eliminate the four pests and infectious diseases that seriously endanger people's health within two years.

    除四害战斗迅速扩展
    成千成万单位做到四无，迟缓地区正在迎头赶上
    据新华社讯　全民性的以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动正在全国各地迅速深入地发展，并已取得巨大成就。据二十五个省（自治区）、市现有不完全材料的统计，消灭老鼠麻雀共计三亿多只，消灭蚊蝇二十四万六千多斤和四百五十四万多盒，挖蝇蛹三百三十九万二千多斤，清除了数以千万吨计的垃圾，改善了城乡卫生状况。
