    A New Leap Forward in Art
    By Renmin Ribao Commentator
    The forty state-owned theatrical troupes in Beijing and other places, the day before yesterday, put forward a revolutionary proposal to fraternal theatrical troupes across the country: to further implement the policy of running undertakings diligently and thriftily, and to achieve complete self-sufficiency from this year onwards, without any state subsidies.
  This is a pioneering undertaking, a leap forward, in the cultural and artistic sector during the upsurge of socialist construction. It shows that cultural and artistic workers have greatly raised their socialist consciousness and have begun to muster revolutionary vigor, resolutely overcome bourgeois ideology and work styles, implement the policy of running undertakings diligently and thriftily and serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and save all possible manpower, financial resources, and materials to cooperate with and support the country's socialist construction.
    At the beginning of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, in order to support the development of socialist literature and art, it was necessary for the state to subsidize state-owned art troupes. In 1955, due to the rapid development of the arts and closer ties with the masses, they gradually acquired the conditions for self-sufficiency. Therefore, the state put forward the policy of enterprise management for state-owned art troupes. However, in the past two or three years, progress in this area has been slow. Only a portion of local state-owned art troupes have achieved self-sufficiency and have even been able to turn over profits to the state. On the other hand, in more state-owned art troupes, serious bourgeois extravagance and wastefulness have grown. They competed in extravagance and lavishness in management, and blindly expanded their staffing, resulting in the accumulation and waste of much manpower and materials, while they continued to demand large sums of money from the state. More seriously, the direct consequence of this bureaucratism, extravagance, lethargy, and squeamishness was that some art undertakings became detached from the masses and from reality, affecting and hindering the service of art undertakings to workers, peasants and soldiers, and to socialist construction. Judging from what the cultural and artistic departments have revealed in this anti-waste campaign, this is truly shocking and distressing.
    However, our cause is, after all, a socialist cause, and we Communists are, after all, promoters. This is true on the economic front, and it is also true on the cultural and artistic front. As long as we are determined to burn away shortcomings, muster revolutionary vigor, and resolutely eliminate the bureaucratism, extravagance, lethargy, and squeamishness that corrode socialist cultural and artistic undertakings, we will be able to do everything that was previously considered impossible. The proposal of these forty groups is one example. "Self-sufficiency," something that most people were afraid to guarantee or reluctant to overcome this or that difficulty in previous years or even previous months, has become possible under the encouragement and promotion of the great leap forward in production and ideology on all fronts across the country. The day before yesterday, they were able to pat their chests and challenge their fraternal theatrical troupes across the country. As a matter of fact, our state-owned theatrical troupes, especially drama, opera, and acrobatics troupes, have had a number of popular performance programs over the years, and they also have relatively substantial material equipment. After fully mobilizing the enthusiasm, creativity, and reforming various unreasonable systems, striving for complete self-sufficiency is by no means a difficult problem to solve.
    Therefore, we say that the self-sufficiency of these forty troupes is a good start. The four art troupes directly under the Ministry of Culture alone can save more than one million yuan in state subsidies each year after achieving self-sufficiency. Judging from this point alone, the national cultural and artistic undertakings are not the "unprofitable government departments" that some people say they are, but rather have great hope for savings. If the national cultural and artistic undertakings can all implement the policy of running undertakings diligently and thriftily, they can save at least 100 to 200 million yuan during the Second Five-Year Plan period.
    We say that this is a good start, and there is even more significance to it. That is, the implementation of this proposal will definitely promote the improvement of the quality of the troupes and promote their better service to workers, peasants, and soldiers. After achieving self-sufficiency, the troupes must continuously enrich their repertoire, perform more new plays with higher ideological and artistic quality that are popular with the masses, and continuously improve their performance level. They must also change the management systems and leadership methods that are not suitable for the new situation and new tasks, so that manpower can be fully utilized under the principle of overall planning and ensuring that everyone is in their proper place. At the same time, compared with asking the state for money in the past, self-sufficiency will lay a solid foundation for gradually improving the lives of art workers. All of these have prepared new conditions for promoting the prosperity of socialist art.
    The proposal puts forward five guarantees, namely, ensuring that they go deep among the workers and peasants, improve the quality of performances, actively stage programs reflecting the struggles of reality, increase income and save expenses, not reduce the average wage income level, and strengthen political, professional, and cultural learning. These are necessary. Only by adhering to these five guarantees can we avoid the tendency to focus solely on economics. If we only pay attention to economic self-sufficiency and abandon something more important politically, that would be putting the cart before the horse.
    In the high tide of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and construction, the cultural and artistic departments have been somewhat slow to move. Now, they are catching up. This is very gratifying. We hope that this proposal will surge like a spring tide into every art troupe across the country, and that everyone will muster their energy and actively respond, striving to achieve self-sufficiency this year. Those whose conditions are not yet ripe should actively prepare, take less state subsidies, and strive to achieve self-sufficiency next year. The pioneers have already taken big steps forward, and those who come later should hurry up and catch up! The people are eagerly and earnestly looking forward to a great leap forward on this front to cooperate with the great leap forward on the industrial and agricultural production fronts! The bugle has already sounded, cultural and artistic workers, let us all forge ahead courageously!

    艺术事业中新的跃进
    本报评论员
    北京和其他地方的四十个国营剧团，前天向全国兄弟剧团提出了一项革命性的倡议：进一步贯彻勤俭办事业的方针，从今年起作到完全自足自给，不要国家任何补助。
  这是文化艺术部门在社会主义建设高潮中的一个创举，一个跃进。这说明文化艺术工作者大大提高了社会主义觉悟，已经开始在鼓起革命干劲，坚决克服资产阶级思想作风，贯彻勤俭办事业、为工农兵服务的方针，节省一切可能节省的人力、财力、物力，配合和支援国家的社会主义建设。
    在建国之初，为了扶助社会主义文艺事业的发展，国家对国营艺术团体给予补贴，是必要的。1955年，由于艺术事业的迅速发展，联系了广大群众，逐渐具备了自给自足的条件，所以国家就提出了国营艺术团体实行企业化的方针。但是两三年来，这方面的工作进展不大，只有一部分地方国营剧团做到了自给自足，并且还能向国家上缴利润。而在更多的国营艺术团体中，却相反地滋长了严重的资产阶级挥霍铺张作风，在经营管理上比阔气，讲排场，在编制上盲目扩大；以致积压和浪费了许多人力和物资，而他们还不断地向国家大量要钱。更严重的是，这种官气、阔气、暮气、娇气的直接恶果，是使一部分艺术事业脱离群众，脱离实际，影响并妨碍了艺术事业为工农兵、为社会主义建设服务。从文化艺术部门在这次反浪费之火中所烧出来的东西看，这真是令人吃惊而又令人痛心的。
    然而，我们的事业毕竟是社会主义的事业，我们共产党人毕竟是促进派。在经济战线上是如此，在文化艺术战线上也是如此。只要我们决心烧掉缺点，鼓足革命干劲，坚决清除腐蚀社会主义文化艺术事业的官气、阔气、暮气、娇气，我们就能够做出一切以前所认为不能办到的事情来。这四十个团体的倡议书就是一例。“自给自足”，这在前几年甚至前几个月大部分人还不敢保证，还怯于去克服这样或那样的困难，但是，受到全国各个战线上生产和思想大跃进的鼓舞和推动，不可能的就成为可能了。到前天，他们就能够拍拍胸脯，向全国兄弟剧团挑战了。事实也正是这样，我们的国营剧团，特别是话剧、戏曲和杂技团体，几年来已经有了一批受观众欢迎的演出节目，也有了比较充实的物质设备，在充分地发挥群众的积极性创造性和改革了各种不合理的制度以后，争取完全自给自足决不是难于解决的问题。
    因此，我们说，这四十个剧团的自给自足是个很好的开始。仅仅文化部所属四个艺术团体，在自给自足以后，每年就能节约国家补贴一百多万元。仅从这一点来看全国的文化艺术事业，实在不像某些人所说的“清水衙门”，而是节约大有希望，如果全国文化艺术事业都能贯彻勤俭办事业的方针，在第二个五年计划期间，就至少能节省出一、两亿元。
    我们说这是很好的开始，还有更多的意义，这就是这个倡议的实行，一定会促进剧团质量的提高，促进它们更好地为工农兵服务。自给自足以后，剧团一定要不断地丰富上演节目，多演思想性和艺术性较高的、为群众喜闻乐见的新戏，不断地提高演出水平；也一定要改变不适合于新形势新任务的经营管理制度和领导方法，在统筹安排、各得其所的原则下使人力可以得到充分的发挥；同时，比起过去伸手向国家要钱来说，自给自足会给逐步改善艺术工作者的生活打下坚实的基础。所有这些，又为促使社会主义的艺术事业的繁荣准备了新的条件。
    倡议书里提出五条保证，即保证深入工农群众，提高演出质量、积极上演反映现实斗争的节目，增加收入节约开支，不降低平均工资收入水平和加强政治、业务、文化学习，这是必要的。只有坚持这五项保证，才能避免单纯从经济上着眼的倾向。如果只注意在经济上自给自足，而在政治上抛弃了更为重要的东西，那就是买椟还珠了。
    在工农业生产建设大跃进的高潮中，文化艺术部门动作得比较迟缓了一些，现在，他们赶上来了。这是十分可喜的事情。我们希望这个倡议像春潮一样涌到全国各个艺术团体里去，大家鼓起干劲，积极响应；争取今年做到完成自给自足；条件确实还不成熟的，就积极准备，少拿国家补贴，争取明年做到自给自足。先行者已经迈开大步走向前去了，后来的赶快赶上去！人民群众是多么热情地和殷切地期待着这条战线上的大跃进，来配合工农业生产战线的大跃进啊！号角已经响了，文化艺术工作者们，大家奋勇前进吧！
