    The Problems of France
    “Mendicant Diplomacy”
    During the foreign policy debate in the National Assembly on January 22, French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard and Foreign Minister Christian Pineau repeatedly declared their "loyalty" to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Pineau even said that "if the United States loses interest in Europe," it would not be "of much benefit" to France.
    There is, of course, a reason why the heads of the French government are so flattering to their "allies" across the Atlantic. After seventeen days of lobbying in Washington, a French financial delegation led by Jean Monnet recently obtained a sum of "emergency aid." France's current financial situation is so dire that it is difficult to survive without borrowing from abroad.
    However, verbal "pledges of loyalty" alone are not enough to make the United States "open its purse." In recent diplomatic activities, the French government has been trying its best to adjust its tone to the tune of Washington, which is the price it must pay for the aforementioned "emergency aid."
    In his reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Nikolai Bulganin, Gaillard, while also believing that "a new world war would cause terrible consequences for all mankind" and expressing some empty wishes for easing international tensions, adopted a negative attitude towards a series of peace initiatives by the Soviet government. He used the need for "thorough preparation" as an excuse to delay the holding of a summit meeting, insisted that the signing of a non-aggression pact would be of no benefit, and stubbornly claimed that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe would not be effective...
    On the other hand, the French government seems quite interested in the U.S. missile base plan; Gaillard even described the U.S. rocket launchers as "necessities" that France cannot refuse. According to Hervé Alphand, the French ambassador to the United States, U.S. missile bases will be established on French territory by the end of this year, and a bilateral agreement between the United States and France will be signed in the near future.
    In short, the situation is just as the famous French commentator Maurice Duverger wrote: "To ask for something from someone, you must obey them. In this way, we are back on the road of mendicant diplomacy."
    A Pathetic "Great Power"
    "Mendicant diplomacy" seems incompatible with the status of a "great power." However, since the post-war period, France has been striving to maintain its "great power status" while pursuing "mendicant diplomacy" for a long time.
    In order to maintain its "great power status," France has not been entirely without resistance to the exclusion and squeezing of its American "allies." On the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit held last December, a dispute broke out between Paris and Washington. This was because Eisenhower and Macmillan agreed on a plan to establish an Anglo-American "core leadership" in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, placing France in a position of a "secondary partner"; and these two "allies" colluded to give France a hard time in the Tunisian arms supply incident.
    At that time, the reaction in Paris was quite intense. Gaillard protested to the United States and Britain several times over the Tunisian incident, and declared in strong terms his opposition to the United States and Britain gaining a dominant position over other "allied countries" in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. At a dinner party for the American ambassador, he even spoke of neutrality with a threatening tone.
    France also actively sought capital in this bargaining between "partners." On the one hand, it attempted to rally countries such as West Germany and Italy to form a "Continental European front" to counter the "Anglo-Saxon core"; on the other hand, it tried to accelerate the development of nuclear weapons and rockets, making itself the third "nuclear power" in the West. At that time, French Defense Minister Chaban-Delmas publicly criticized the United States and Britain several times for discriminating against France by attempting to monopolize nuclear weapons within the Western camp, and insisted that France would retain the right to produce nuclear weapons. The recent joint establishment of a so-called "arms triangle" for the joint manufacture of weapons by France, West Germany, and Italy is a manifestation of France's efforts in these two areas.
    However, since the French government has had to beg Washington for "aid," thereby being pulled tightly by the ropes, there is no question of improving its position in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    Drinking Poison to Quench Thirst
    France has fallen into such a situation precisely because of its pursuit of the "North Atlantic policy," engaging in arms expansion and war preparations, and persisting in the colonial war in Algeria.
    Since France joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, military spending has risen linearly: it was 289 billion francs in 1949, and is estimated to reach 1,420 billion francs in 1957, an increase of almost four times in eight years. Military expenditure in Algeria was 272 billion francs in 1955, increased to 619 billion francs in 1956, and is estimated to be as high as 700 billion francs in 1957. As a result, the fiscal deficit has become larger year by year. The budget deficit for 1957 is close to 1,000 billion francs, and the total national treasury deficit exceeds 1,500 billion francs. At the same time, the expansion of military production has greatly increased the import of raw materials and consumed huge amounts of products that could have been exported, which has further deteriorated the situation of foreign trade. The trade deficit with foreign countries in 1957 is estimated to reach 500 billion francs. As a result, the situation of the exhaustion of the national treasury and the depletion of foreign exchange reserves has naturally followed.
    Gaillard is currently boasting that France's finances will be restored because of the U.S. dollars it received from Washington. He seems to have forgotten the fact that since the war, the total amount of various "aid" France has received from the United States has exceeded 10 billion U.S. dollars, but the financial situation has always been fraught with difficulties. The reason is very simple: the financial resources devoured by military spending are many times more than "U.S. aid." The situation will be the same in the future. The Algerian war is still going on, and the cost of the war is bound to increase more than in the past. In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, France's burden will become heavier. In this case, a few hundred million U.S. dollars of "aid" is just a drop in the bucket and can never solve France's financial problems.
    It should also be seen that along with U.S. "aid" will come the infiltration of U.S. capital and the dumping of U.S. goods. Because France accepted U.S. "aid," the United States' direct private investment in mainland France more than doubled in the six years from 1949 to 1955, and increased by two-thirds in French Africa. There is also a condition for this U.S. provision of "aid" to France: France must relax import controls on U.S. goods. It goes without saying what this means for France, which has always relied on high tariffs for protection in foreign trade. Therefore, the French government's practice of begging the United States for "aid" to solve its financial crisis is actually drinking poison to quench thirst.
    "Death Row Inmate"
    The disasters brought to France by the North Atlantic policy are not only manifested in the economy. As everyone knows, France suffered heavy damage under the ravages of German militarism in the two world wars. However, since the post-war period, as a result of the pressure exerted by the United States through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, France has adopted a policy of supporting and fostering the rearmament of West Germany, which is like raising a tiger to cause future trouble. As a result, West Germany's economic strength quickly overwhelmed France, and revanchist forces are on the rise, which poses a huge threat to France. At present, France and West Germany are establishing this or that kind of cooperation, and one of the purposes is to try to restrain West Germany by this. However, it seems that this cannot stop West Germany's trend of dominating the Western European continent. Therefore, France cannot but try to seek the "protection" of the United States and the "cooperation" of Britain to deal with this terrible opponent, which is also one of the reasons that makes France weak in dealing with the United States and Britain.
    France's sovereignty has also been arbitrarily trampled upon by the United States because of the implementation of the North Atlantic policy. It is enough to point out that, according to French official materials, in 24 provinces of France, that is, one-third of the country's territory, there are U.S. military bases, shooting ranges, and other military facilities. And the problem is even more serious at present. U.S. planes carrying hydrogen bombs are already circling over French airspace, and U.S. intermediate-range missile bases will be established on French territory. In other words, this means that U.S. generals control France's destiny, and France may be turned into scorched earth at any time for the sake of Washington's interests. Therefore, some French newspapers worriedly exclaimed that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has become the "gate of hell," and France is acting as a "death row inmate" in it. This is not an exaggeration.
    "Hope" and Disaster
    North Africa has always been regarded by France as its lifeblood. Especially after the discovery of abundant resources in the Sahara, some people in Paris even believe that "France's future hope" lies in this great desert. This is why the French government insists on continuing the colonial war in Algeria.
    "Future hope" is still very slim, but the real disasters are already very obvious. Leaving aside the serious economic consequences, the Algerian war has also put two pigtails in Washington's hands: on the one hand, France needs to rely on some U.S. military "aid" in this war; on the other hand, France has to rely on the support of the United States whenever the United Nations discusses this issue. Recently, because France's situation in the war has become increasingly unfavorable, its relations with Tunisia and Morocco have deteriorated, and the United States and Britain have decided to take the opportunity to jointly undermine France's foundations in North Africa, and have already made a preliminary attempt in the Tunisian arms supply incident, Paris is even more eager to obtain a guarantee from Washington: recognize France's special status in North Africa and support France's current "efforts" in North Africa. It is not unrelated to this that France is trying its best to please the United States in its diplomatic activities.
    However, this is just a wishful thinking of France. The alluring smell of oil in the Sahara has made Washington impatient to seize this rich desert. The secret letter of Little Hoover, which was recently published in the "Neues Deutschland," blatantly reveals this point. Therefore, despite Gaillard's constant pleas, the United States has always refused to make any promises on this issue. However, the United States will indeed "support" France to continue fighting the Algerian war. Washington's scheme is quite vicious. Because, as Little Hoover said in his secret letter, France "cannot spend billions of dollars on the Algerian war and expect to have enough usable funds to develop Africa." If this war does not stop, it will of course only be beneficial for the United States to take advantage of the situation and replace France's position in North Africa. Not only that, Washington also hopes that France will sink deeper and deeper into this desperate war, and finally weaken to the point where it no longer has the capital to follow a "relatively independent line," and will only become a "little boy" who obeys the United States in the future.
    Vicious Circle
    Because of succumbing to the United States, France faces more and more difficulties; and because of the increasing difficulties it faces, France becomes more and more submissive to the United States - the French government is spinning around in such a vicious circle, so it is no wonder that its situation is deteriorating.
    In France, more and more people advocate changing the current foreign policy. At present, holding summit talks has become the most ardent demand of the French public, and the movement against the establishment of U.S. intermediate-range missile bases in France is surging across the country; even some political figures who used to support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have begun to change their opinions. Of course, in order to get rid of dependence on the United States, it is also necessary to change the colonial policy in North Africa. The call to end the Algerian war is rising. From the sober remarks made by many famous figures in the French Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party recently, we can see this trend in French public opinion.
    Where France goes from here is now the time to decide. As a major country, France can make its own contribution to promoting East-West summit talks, achieving peaceful coexistence, and stopping the arms race. Doing so will not only help ease the international situation, but also improve its own situation. Otherwise, France will not only fail to get rid of its status as a "secondary partner," but will also fall into a greater tragedy.

    法国的问题
    “乞求外交”
    法国总理盖伊阿和外交部长比诺1月22日在国民议会举行外交辩论时再三申明他们对北大西洋集团的“忠诚”。比诺甚至说：“假如美国对欧洲失去兴趣”，这对法国是不会“有多大好处”的。
    法国政府首脑对大西洋彼岸的“盟友”这样奉承倍至，当然是有原因的。由让·莫内率领的一个法国财政代表团在华盛顿经过十七天的奔走，最近终于得到了一笔“紧急援助”。法国目前的财政状况是如此窘迫，以致不借外债日子就很难过下去了。
    但是，光凭口头上的“矢忠”是不能使美国“解囊相助”的。在最近的外交活动中，法国政府竭力随着华盛顿的笛声来调节自己的音调，就是为上述那笔“紧急援助”所必须付出的代价。
    在给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的复信中，盖伊阿虽然也认为“新的世界大战将使全人类遭受悲惨的后果”，并且对缓和国际紧张局势表示了一些空洞的愿望；然而，对于苏联政府的一系列和平倡议，他却采取了否定的态度：他借口需要“缜密准备”来拖延最高级会议的举行，他咬定签订互不侵犯公约是毫无好处的，他硬说建立中欧无原子武器区不会有什么功效……。
    另一方面，法国政府对于美国的导弹基地计划却显得颇有兴趣；盖伊阿甚至把美国的火箭发射器说成是法国不能拒绝的“必需品”。据法国驻美大使埃尔弗·阿尔芳透露，美国导弹基地今年年底就要在法国领土上建立起来，在最近期间内美法两国即将签订一个双边协定。
    总之，情况正如法国著名的评论家杜维歇所写的那样：“要求人，就必须顺从人家。这样一来，我们就又走上了乞求外交的道路。”
    可悲的“大国”
    “乞求外交”，看来似乎是和“大国地位”难以相容的。然而，法国在战后以来却是一面竭力企图维护自己的“大国地位”，一面又长期奉行着“乞求外交”。
    为了维护“大国地位”，法国对于美国“盟友”的排挤和倾轧也并非毫无反抗。在去年12月举行的北大西洋集团首脑会议的前夕，巴黎和华盛顿之间就曾经爆发过一场风波。这是因为，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦商定了在北大西洋集团里建立美英“核心领导”的计划，把法国摆在一个“次等伙伴”的位置上；而这两个“盟友”又串通一气，在突尼斯军火供应事件中把法国狠狠整了一下。
    当时，巴黎的反应是相当激烈的。盖伊阿就突尼斯事件几次向美英两国提出抗议，并且用强硬的语调声明反对美英两国在北大西洋集团中获得对其它“盟国”的支配地位。在一次招待美国大使的宴会上，他甚至带着威胁的意味谈到了中立问题。
    法国在这场“伙伴”之间的讨价还价中，也曾经积极筹措资本。一方面，它企图拉拢西德和意大利等国搞起一个“欧洲大陆阵线”，来和“盎格鲁—撒克逊核心”相抗衡；另一方面，它力图加速发展核武器和火箭，使自己成为西方第三个“核子强国”。法国国防部长沙邦—戴尔马当时就曾经几次公开指责美英两国要在西方阵营内垄断核武器的打算是对法国的歧视，坚持法国将保留生产核武器的权利。最近法国和西德、意大利筹建联合制造武器的所谓“军备三角地带”，正是法国在这两方面进行努力的一种表现。
    可是，法国政府既然不得不向华盛顿乞求“援助”，从而被人家拉紧了绳索，那末，也就谈不上在北大西洋集团里改善自己的地位了。
    饮鸩止渴
    法国所以弄到如此地步，这正是它追随“北大西洋政策”从事扩军备战和坚持进行阿尔及利亚的殖民战争的结果。
    自从法国参加北大西洋集团以来，军费支出就直线上升：1949年是二千八百九十亿法郎，1957年估计达到一万四千二百亿法郎，八年中几乎增加了四倍。在阿尔及利亚的军事开支，1955年是二千七百二十亿法郎，1956年就增为六千一百九十亿法郎，1957年估计更高达七千亿法郎。因此，财政赤字一年比一年庞大，1957年的预算赤字将近一万亿法郎，而国库总赤字超过了一万五千亿法郎。同时，军事生产的扩张大大增加了原料的进口，并且消耗了巨额本来可以出口的产品，这又使对外贸易情况日益恶化，1957年同外国的贸易逆差估计达到五千亿法郎。于是，国库枯竭、外汇储备耗尽的局面自然就随之而出现了。
    盖伊阿目前已在吹嘘法国的财政将因为得到华盛顿的美元而复原。他似乎忘记了这件事实：战后以来，法国从美国得到的各种“援助”总数超过一百亿美元，可是财政状况一直是困难重重。原因很简单，军事开支吞噬的财力要比“美援”多好几倍。今后的情况也一样。阿尔及利亚战争还在打下去，战争费用势必比过去增加。在北大西洋集团里，法国的负担也会更加沉重。在这种情况下，区区几亿美元的“援助”不过是杯水车薪，决不可能解决法国的财政问题。
    还应该看到，随着美国的“援助”而来的，将是美国资本的渗入和美国商品的倾销。由于法国接受了美国的“援助”，在1949年到1955年六年中，美国的私人直接投资在法国本土增加了一倍多，在法属非洲增加了三分之二。这次美国提供法国“援助”也有一个条件：法国要放宽对美国商品的进口控制。这对于在对外贸易中一直依靠高关税保护的法国意味着什么，是不言而喻的。因此，法国政府以乞求美国“援助”来解决它的财政危机的做法，实际上是在饮鸩止渴。
    “待决的死囚”
    北大西洋政策给法国带来的灾难不仅表现在经济上。谁都知道，在两次世界大战中，法国曾在德国军国主义的蹂躏下受到了惨重的损害。但是，战后以来，由于美国通过北大西洋集团施加压力的结果，法国采取了支持和扶植西德重新武装这种养虎遗患的政策。于是，西德的经济实力很快压倒了法国，复仇主义势力日益抬头，这对法国形成一种巨大的威胁。目前法国和西德建立这种那种的合作，目的之一就是想借此来约制西德。不过，看来这并不能阻挡西德在西欧大陆称霸的趋势。因此，法国不能不设法谋求美国的“保护”和英国的“合作”来对付这个可怕的对头，这也是使法国在和美国、英国打交道时处于软弱地位的一个原因。
    法国的主权也因为执行北大西洋政策而被美国任意践踏着。只要指出这一点就够了：根据法国官方的材料，在法国的二十四个省，即全国三分之一的领土上，有着美国的军事基地、射击场和其它军事建筑。而问题在目前是更加严重了。载运着氢弹的美国飞机已经在法国领空上盘旋，美国的中程导弹基地又将在法国领土上建立起来。换句话说，这意味着美国将军掌握了法国的命运，法国随时可能为了华盛顿的利益而化为焦土。因此，法国有些报刊忧虑地惊呼：北大西洋集团已经成了“地狱之门”，而法国正在其中充当一个“待决的死囚”。这并不算过甚其辞的说法。
    “希望”和灾难
    北非一直被法国看作是自己的命根子。特别是在撒哈拉发现了丰富的资源蕴藏以后，巴黎甚至有人认为，
  “法国未来的希望”是在这个大沙漠中。这就是法国政府非要把阿尔及利亚的殖民战争继续下去不可的缘故。
    “未来的希望”毕竟还很渺茫，然而现实的灾难却已经十分明显了。撇开严重的经济恶果不谈，阿尔及利亚战争还使法国把两条小辫子交在华盛顿的手里：一方面，法国在这场战争中需要依靠一部分美国的军火“援助”；另一方面，每当联合国讨论这个问题时法国都得仰仗美国的撑腰。最近，由于法国在战争中的处境越来越不利，和突尼斯、摩洛哥的关系日趋恶化，而美英两国又决定乘机合伙在北非挖法国的墙脚，在突尼斯军火供应事件中已经初试牛刀，于是巴黎更急于从华盛顿那里得到一个保证：承认法国在北非的特殊地位，支持法国目前在北非的“努力”。目前法国在外交活动中尽量讨好美国，和这一点不是没有关系的。
    可是，这只是法国的一种痴心妄想。撒哈拉诱人的石油气味已经使华盛顿迫不及待地攫取这个富饶的大沙漠了。最近“新德意志报”刊载的小胡佛的密信就露骨地表明了这一点。因此，尽管盖伊阿不断苦苦求告，美国在这个问题上始终不肯有所许诺。不过，对于阿尔及利亚战争，美国倒的确会“支持”法国继续打下去。华盛顿的计谋是相当毒辣的。因为，事情正如小胡佛在他的密信里所说的，法国“不能在阿尔及利亚战事中花费数以十亿计的款项而又期望有足够的可动用的款项来发展非洲”。这场战争不停止，当然只会有利于美国乘虚而入，取代法国在北非的地位。不仅如此，华盛顿还希望法国在这场绝望的战争中越陷越深，最后削弱得再也没有遵循“比较独立的路线”的本钱，以后就只能成为俯首听命于美国的一个“小伙计”了。
    恶性循环
    由于屈从美国，法国面临的困难就越来越多；而由于面临的困难越来越多，法国就更加屈从美国——法国政府绕着这样一个恶性循环的圈子转，这就无怪乎处境会每况愈下了。
    在法国，已经有越来越多的人主张改变现行的外交政策。目前，举行最高级谈判已经成为法国公众最强烈的要求，反对在法国建立美国中程导弹基地的运动正在全国汹涌澎湃地展开着；甚至某些过去支持北大西洋集团的政治人物也开始改变他们的意见。当然，为了摆脱对美国的依赖，还必须改变在北非的殖民政策。要求结束阿尔及利亚战争的呼声正在日益高涨。从最近以来法国社会党和激进社会党中不少著名人士所发表的清醒的言论中，可以看到法国公众舆论的这种动向。
    法国何去何从，现在已经是抉择的时候了。作为一个大国，法国是能够为促进东西方最高级会谈，实现和平共处和停止军备竞赛作出自己的贡献，这样做，不但会有利于缓和国际局势，并且也将改善自己的处境。否则法国不但不能摆脱“次等伙伴”的地位，并且还将陷入更大的悲剧之中。
