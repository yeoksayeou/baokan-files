Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production: Seeds are Needed in Extraordinary Quantities
Provinces Help Each Other by Adjusting Large Quantities of Improved Seeds

(Our dispatch) In the past month and a half, various provinces and regions have fully promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and support and carried out a great deal of seed adjustment work. According to statistics: from January to mid-February this year, in a month and a half, the early and late rice, spring wheat, barley, corn, potato, and peanut seeds that were mutually supported and adjusted between the provinces have reached more than 446 million catties. This amount is nearly twelve times more than the transportation volume in the first quarter of last year, and 28.5% more than the transportation volume of the entire last year.

The strong support between provinces, the attention of the Party committee and government leading departments, and the close cooperation of various business departments are a feature of this year's seed adjustment and transportation. Hebei and Tianjin have adopted various methods to support Henan and Shandong in expanding the seeds needed for paddy fields. Thanks to their efforts, the requested allocation volume of Shandong and Henan provinces has been basically met. A total of 19 million catties of "Yin Fang" and "Shui Yuan" rice seeds and 13 million catties of dry rice seeds were transferred to Henan; 32.5 million catties of "Yin Fang" and 3.5 million catties of dry rice were transferred to Shandong. In the spirit of mutual assistance, Henan Province also tried to support Hebei with more than 6.3 million catties of wheat seeds. Hunan and Hubei provinces have a large task of conversion this year. The former converts about 6 million mu of indica to japonica; the latter expands double-cropping rice by 8 million mu. The seeds required for the conversion of the two provinces have been supported by ten provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Sichuan, and Shanghai. Hunan Province has transferred in more than 62 million catties of late japonica rice seeds, and Hubei has transferred in more than 43 million catties of early indica and early japonica rice seeds, and 2.47 million catties of late japonica. At the same time, Zhejiang and Guangxi transferred a large number of South Special "No. 16" early rice from Guangdong, and Hubei, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang and other provinces transferred out wheat seeds such as "Bi Yu", "2419", "Gansu 96" and "Spring Barley" to supply Hebei, Shandong and other provinces.

Within the provinces, the seed adjustment and transportation work was mostly carried out by the agricultural departments in the past. This year, all relevant departments have strengthened their cooperation. Henan Province has a large task of seed adjustment this year. The Provincial People's Committee organized the agricultural, grain, and transportation departments to work together in a centralized office and be responsible for it. Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong and other provinces lacked potato seeds, and the agricultural, grain, supply and marketing, and urban service departments jointly organized working groups to purchase from other provinces, and they all received good results.

    农业生产大跃进　种子需要特别多
    各省互助互济大量调剂良种
    本报讯　近一个半月来，各个省区之间充分发扬互相协助、互相支援的精神进行了大量调剂种子的工作。根据统计：从今年1月到2月中旬的一个半月里，各省之间相互支援调剂的早晚稻、春小麦、大麦、玉米、薯类和花生等种子，已有四亿四千六百多万斤。这个数量比去年第一季度的调运量，增加将近十二倍，比去年全年的调运量，也增多28.5％。
    省与省之间的大力支援，党委和政府领导部门的重视，各业务部门密切配合，是今年调剂、调运种子的一个特点。河北、天津市采用了多种办法支援河南、山东扩大稻田所需的种子。由于它们的努力，山东、河南两省要求的调拨量基本上得到满足，计调给河南“银坊”、“水源”稻种一千九百万斤，旱稻种一千三百万斤；调给山东“银坊”三千二百五十万斤，旱稻三百五十万斤。河南省本着互助精神，也设法支援了河北麦种六百三十多万斤。湖南、湖北两省今年改制任务很大，前者籼改粳约六百万亩；后者扩大双季稻八百万亩。两省改制所需种子，得到了江苏、浙江、安徽、江西、广东、广西、黑龙江、吉林、四川、上海等十个省市的支援。湖南省已调进晚粳稻种六千二百多万斤，湖北已调进早籼、早粳稻种四千三百多万斤，晚粳二百四十七万斤。与此同时，浙江、广西向广东调入了大批南特“16号”早稻，湖北、甘肃、内蒙古、黑龙江等省调出了“碧玉”、“2419”、“甘肃96”、“春大麦”等麦种，供给河北、山东等省。
    在各省内，过去种子的调剂调运工作多由农业部门负责进行，今年，各有关部门都加强了协作。河南省今年的种子调剂任务很大，省人民委员会组织了农业、粮食、交通三个部门集中办公，统一负责。浙江、湖南、山东等省缺乏马铃薯种，农业、粮食、供销、城市服务等部门共同组织工作组到外省采购，都收到了很好的效果。
