Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Korean people, with boundless excitement, express their welcome and support for the joint statement issued by the governments of China and North Korea in Pyongyang on February 19.

After hearing the broadcast of the joint statement of the Chinese and North Korean governments on loudspeakers and radios on February 19, workers, staff, and citizens of Pyongyang gathered to express their support for the joint statement.

At the Pyongyang Rubber Factory, employees held a gathering under the slogans "Long Live the Sino-Korean Friendship Cemented in Blood!" and "Respects to the Brave Warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers!"

Worker Kwon Young-deok said that the decision of the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw completely from Korea once again demonstrates China's sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue and easing tensions in the Far East. We will, together with the Korean People's Army, express our gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers who defended the peace line with their blood. We strongly demand that the U.S. invading forces immediately get out of the territory of Korea, and we will definitely wage a resolute struggle to realize this demand.

Cadres and staff of the Korean State Planning Commission also held a gathering on February 19. Staff member Park Eung-soon said at the meeting that this joint statement encourages me to fight with greater confidence and courage for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the cause of socialist construction.

Pyongyang newspapers warmly support the joint statement of the Chinese and North Korean governments. "Rodong Sinmun," the organ of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, published an editorial on February 20 entitled "A Document of Great Significance for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea and Peace in the Far East," stating that the joint statement issued by the governments of China and North Korea is of utmost importance to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the development of the entire international situation. The entire Korean people most warmly welcome the joint statement and express their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese government and the Chinese people for their sincere efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

The editorial emphasizes that the outcome of the talks between the delegations of the Chinese and North Korean governments, regarding the measure of the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea within this year, is a major measure of historical significance to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The editorial states that the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea stems from the lofty purpose of their participation in the Korean War. The Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea never pursued any other purpose other than repelling the aggressors, extinguishing the flames of war, and restoring peace and security in the entire Far East. They have now gloriously completed their historical mission and have decided to voluntarily withdraw from Korea. The Korean people will never forget the immortal achievements established by the Chinese People's Volunteers.

The editorial states that the Chinese and North Korean sides have already taken practical actions to open up a new path for solving the issue that has matured – the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. Now, we firmly assert that the United States and other governments participating in the "United Nations Forces" should also take the same measures immediately. If they have the slightest sincerity towards the peaceful reunification of Korea, they have no excuse not to withdraw their troops from South Korea.

"Minju Choson" published an editorial on the same day entitled "A Solemn Declaration for Peace and for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea," stating that the joint statement of the governments of China and North Korea not only fully represents the interests of the people of China and North Korea, but is also a historical document of great significance for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. The Korean people warmly welcome and support it with great satisfaction.

    朝鲜人民热烈拥护中朝联合声明
    各国舆论纷纷指出美国应当从朝鲜撤军
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：朝鲜人民以无限兴奋的心情，表示欢迎和支持朝中两国政府2月19日在平壤发表的联合声明。
    平壤市工人、职员和市民们19日在扩音器和收音机前听到朝中两国政府的联合声明广播以后，纷纷集会表示拥护和支持这个联合声明。
    在平壤橡胶工厂，职工们在“以鲜血结成的朝中友谊万岁！”“向志愿军勇士们致敬！”的口号下举行了集会。
    工人权英德说，中国人民志愿军全部从朝鲜撤出的决定，又一次表现了中国对和平解决朝鲜问题和缓和远东紧张局势的诚意。我们将同朝鲜人民军一起，对用鲜血保卫了和平防线的中国人民志愿军表示感谢。我们强烈要求美国侵略军立即从朝鲜的疆土上滚出去，我们一定为实现这个要求而进行坚决的斗争。
    朝鲜国家计划委员会的干部和职员们也在19日举行了集会。职员朴应顺在会上说，这个联合声明鼓舞着我以更大的信心和勇气为祖国的和平统一和社会主义建设事业而进行斗争。
    平壤各报热烈支持中朝两国政府的联合声明。朝鲜劳动党中央委员会机关报“劳动新闻”20日发表题为“对朝鲜的和平统一和远东和平具有重大意义的文献”的社论说，朝中两国政府发表的联合声明，对朝鲜问题的和平解决和整个国际形势的发展具有极其重要的意义。全体朝鲜人民最热烈地欢迎联合声明，并且对为和平解决朝鲜问题进行诚挚努力的中国政府和中国人民表示由衷的感谢。
    社论强调，朝中两国政府代表团会谈的结果，关于中国人民志愿军在今年内全部从朝鲜撤出的措施，是对促进朝鲜问题的和平解决具有历史意义的重大措施。社论说，中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤出是出自他们参加朝鲜战争的崇高目的。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜除了为了击退侵略者扑灭战争火焰、恢复整个远东地区的和平和安全的目的以外，从不追求任何其他目的。他们现在光荣地完成了他们的历史使命，并且决定主动地从朝鲜撤出。朝鲜人民永远不能忘记中国人民志愿军所建立的不朽业绩。
    社论说，朝中方面已经用实际行动来为解决已经成熟了的问题——一切外国军队从朝鲜撤出和朝鲜的和平统一——开辟了新的道路。现在，我们坚决主张，美国和其他参加“联合国军”的各国政府也应该立即采取同样的措施。如果它们对朝鲜的和平统一有丝毫的诚意，它们就没有任何借口不从南朝鲜撤出它们的军队。
      “民主朝鲜报”同一天发表题为“为和平和为朝鲜的和平统一的庄严的宣言”的社论说，朝中两国政府的联合声明不仅完全代表着朝中两国人民的利益，并且是对维护远东和世界和平的有重大意义的历史文件。朝鲜人民以十分满意的心情热烈欢迎和拥护它。
