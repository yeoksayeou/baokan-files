　　The Shanghai No. 2 State Cotton Mill has carried out two important reforms during this rectification campaign. One is that all the Party branch secretaries in the workshops have returned to their production posts since the beginning of December last year, working as workers and doing branch work at the same time. The other is that the factory's Party and mass work organizations and management institutions, especially the workshop and workshop management institutions that directly lead production, have been changed to three shifts, just like the production workers. This reform is currently underway.

　　Regarding such changes, some in Shanghai's industrial circles agree, but many are skeptical, worrying that this will bring chaos to the enterprise's management and political work.

　　Is it feasible to not detach from production?

　　The more common question is: In a large factory like the No. 2 State Cotton Mill, a workshop has two or three hundred people. In the past, the branch secretary failed to do a good job even when detached from production. Is it feasible to not detach from production at all now?

　　I visited the No. 2 State Cotton Mill for several days and had multiple conversations with the Party committee secretary, Party committee members, workshop branch secretaries, and the chairman of the trade union. The answers I received were all affirmative and simple. They all said: It is feasible, and it is being done even better than when detached from production. In the past month or so, the masses have been satisfied, and a new atmosphere has emerged in the relationship between the Party and the masses.

　　Party Committee Secretary Wu Lingqiu repeatedly told me: "So far, no branch secretary has told me that they can't do it. On the contrary, most branch secretaries say that the work is easier now; although some have some difficulties at present, no one has retreated."

　　She said: "At the beginning of the rectification campaign, the workers in each workshop raised many opinions about the branch secretaries. Some workers were dissatisfied with the job transfer, some because they were not rated for awards, some did not receive subsidies, some workers in the group quarreled and scolded each other, etc., and they all blamed the branch secretary. Many things that were obviously not the branch secretary's responsibility were also blamed on the branch secretary."

　　The usually calm Party committee secretary seemed a little excited when she said this. She said: "These opinions expressed by the masses really surprised us. Our branch secretaries were originally excellent workers in production and had very good relations with the masses. But now they have become the people with the most opinions from the masses. Why? After our research, we found that the problem lies in the branch secretary being detached from production. Because the branch secretary is detached from production, the branch committee members, workshop trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres are not detached from production. As a result, when administrative cadres encounter mischievous workers, they ask the branch secretary to criticize and educate them. The workshop pushes production plans, appraisals, rewards, hardship subsidies, workers quarreling and scolding people, and other matters to the branch secretary. As a result, the branch secretary spends most of their energy and time taking over the affairs of the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, and conducting ideological education for the few lagging workers in the workshop, accounting for a tiny fraction of the workforce. On the other hand, they don't have time to work with the remaining 99% of the workers and are detached from the broad masses."

　　After discussing the opinions of the masses, the branch secretaries immediately and resolutely demanded to return to production and to return to the masses. The cadres of the trade union, administration, and the Communist Youth League, and all Party members strongly supported their return. The masses showed great enthusiasm and competed to have the branch secretary return to their team and group to produce. Ma Yongxian, the branch secretary of the No. 3 Spinning Fine Yarn Workshop, had more than twenty big-character posters posted about him during the airing of views, accounting for most of the masses' opinions on the branch. However, on the first day he returned to the workshop to produce, the masses asked him with concern: "You haven't done it for several years, can you do it?" Some encouraged him and said: "If you come back and understand the actual situation, you will do a good job."

　　After going down

　　The first major change after the branch secretary returned to the workshop was that all the branch committee members and Party members actively and proactively did political work. The phenomenon of pushing things to the branch secretary or shirking responsibilities that used to happen no longer exists. Wang Xiuzhi, a Party member foreman in the No. 1 Spinning Fine Yarn Workshop, used to push workers with ideological problems to the branch secretary for persuasion and education. Since the branch secretary returned to the workshop to produce, she herself solved the dispatching problem of an old female worker. Of the eighteen Party members in the No. 3 Spinning Fine Yarn Workshop, only twelve used to do political work more regularly. Now, that number has risen to seventeen. Only one person is still temporarily making excuses that she has many children and is busy with housework, and doesn't do much work. Many Party members suggested: No matter how much work there is, if each of us Party members works for a quarter of an hour, it can top the amount of work the branch secretary does in a day.

　　More importantly, after the branch secretary directly participated in production, they discovered some problems that they could not discover in the past. For example, regarding the production indicators of the workers in the dyeing and printing workshop, the administrative cadres previously believed that dyeing and printing production was continuous and automated, and it was difficult to determine the specific tasks and striving directions of a certain worker in production. A branch secretary who does not participate in production cannot easily say that this view is incorrect. Therefore, when the workshop administration arranges work, it only puts forward the requirements for the entire workshop, without setting specific requirements for the workers. When the plan is not completed, it can only find the reasons from technical measures. This time, the branch secretary went down to produce and heard many workers reflect that individuals do not have specific directions. Our production is like blind people, following the machine and unable to take the initiative. The conclusion reached after everyone's research is: as long as there are workers operating, indicators can be set. Although the production is continuous, it requires workers to master it. How to master it? What should be paid attention to and prevented? These are the contents of the indicators.

　　No longer hanging in mid-air

　　The general feeling of the branch secretaries is that they are no longer hanging in mid-air, the work is more practical, and they have time to study. Ma Yongxian, the branch secretary of the No. 3 B Class, told me: "In the past, my work situation was that workers were producing during working hours, so I couldn't go down to the workshop. If I didn't go down, I had nothing to do, so I had to rack my brains all day to find the deputy foreman and trade union group leader to report; because the information I heard was indirect, there was no way to delve deeply. Study was even worse. It was not good to study during working hours. After work, when the workers left work, I was even busier. I was often busy from six or seven in the morning to nine or ten at night. From being detached from production to now, I have never formally attended night school, and I have very little time to read the newspaper on weekdays. Even my wife has opinions about me. She said: Others are also cadres, but I haven't seen anyone as busy as you."

　　Ma Yongxian still has a bit of helpless look when talking about these things now. Talking about now, he is full of energy. He said: "Now it's good. Currently, I am an acting deputy foreman of a work area. From one work area, I can understand the trends and problems of the entire work section. Other work sections have branch committee members in contact, and most Party members also take the initiative to do work. Now, when holding a branch committee meeting or a branch general meeting, because everyone understands the situation, it is not like in the past, where either the branch secretary has the final say, or it drags on for two or three hours without figuring it out. Now, the problems are solved in three quarters of an hour to an hour. After the work is arranged, everyone works separately. Now, after get off work every day, I stay for at most one or two hours and then I'm fine."

　　Ma Yongxian has decided to resume attending amateur middle school after the Spring Festival.

　　It's not just one person's problem

　　Of course, the problem is not completely solved by just having the branch secretary return to the workshop to produce. After the branch secretary returns to the workshop to produce, it requires all branch committee members and Party members to better play a core role in the workshop and jointly do a good job in political work. In this way, reforming the original organizational form of the branch has become a very urgent issue.

　　The original workshop branch was organized by workshop, scattered in the early, middle, and late shifts, and the Party members and branch committee members of the long day shift did not meet each other. It was very difficult to hold a branch committee meeting or a branch general meeting. This is also the reason why the branch secretary alone decided things and took on all the affairs in the past. Now, this factory has reorganized the branch, taking the workshop (including the various work sections that produce a kind of finished product such as yarn, cloth, and colored cloth) as a unit, and organizing the branch according to shifts. The branch secretaries and branch committee members of the same branch have the same work and rest time, and the contact is greatly facilitated.

　　The branch secretary's production and the changes in the grassroots Party organization have also forced all leading departments, including the factory Party committee, to change their old working methods and styles.

　　The old way doesn't work

　　Factory Director Zhang Ming told me that he recently wrote a humorous skit, imagining the results of a cadre going to the factory to understand the situation using the old methods. The branch secretary has already returned to production, but he still comes down to run the situation according to the office working hours, and insists on finding the branch secretary who is producing to talk to him about the situation. As a result, that branch secretary produced several batches of substandard cloth at once. Another time, they had to shut down the car to cope with his visit. This is entirely possible. In the past, when the higher-level authorities issued any temporary tasks, or were coming to inspect the work the next day, the Party committee or the factory department would make a phone call and call the branch secretary to report everything; on weekdays, the work was implemented layer by layer. Therefore, the Party committee could command the entire factory from the office and cope with the higher authorities.

　　Now, the factory Party committee has decided to streamline more than half of the more than sixty full-time Party and mass work cadres in the factory. Only ten Party committee members and full-time staff will be retained, and only twelve full-time cadres of the trade union and the Communist Youth League will be retained. Party committee members are also scattered down, and each person is responsible for leading several branches to specifically help with the work below. Therefore, the practice of reporting the situation layer by layer and issuing instructions layer by layer has been fundamentally changed.

　　According to the characteristics of the continuous three-shift production of textile factories, political work activities are generally concentrated in the middle shift from 12:00 noon to 10:00 p.m. Therefore, the Party committee and other political workers have changed to the middle shift to facilitate contact with the branch secretaries and the masses of each shift. In the event of major domestic and foreign events, or when deploying central work within a certain period of time, the Party committee directly assigns the work to all branch committee members, and even all Party members, by shift. This allows the branch committee members and Party members to directly understand the intentions of the leadership, reduces meetings, and saves time. The Party committee has truly become the command headquarters of the factory's political work. The Party committee leadership has also been freed from a large number of meetings.

　　What is being oriented to production?

　　With the branch secretary returning to the production post and the change in the Party's organizational form, this factory closely followed up with the issue of management agencies being oriented to production. The competent department recently agreed to the reorganization of the factory's management agency. In principle, all management cadres and service departments (such as the health room, public utility section, etc.) below the workshop director work shifts.

　　The factory director said: The issue of management agencies being oriented to production was raised by the Party several years ago. However, in the past few years, we were actually only oriented to the workshop, and the workshop itself, like the factory department, was bureaucratic. The machine is running non-stop for twenty-four hours a day, and workers are producing for twenty-four hours. Our management cadres, however, 90% of them only work eight hours during the day. Each shift in the factory has more than 1,300 workers producing, with a production value of more than 700,000 yuan. However, the cadres who work shifts are only dozens of foremen with general work level. Two-thirds of the factory's production time is carried out almost without leadership. Problems can occur in production and life within twenty-four hours. People will get sick and people will ask for leave. This has resulted in abnormal phenomena such as night shift workers waiting until dawn to get off work every morning, queuing up to wait for doctors, waiting for cadres, and waiting for the workshop director to ask for instructions. Can this be considered being oriented to production?

　　"Since I came to this factory in 1951, the number of cadres has increased from more than 300 to more than 600, but most of them have been added to the departments. Things that happen in twenty-four hours are all concentrated in eight hours during the day. The number of computers has increased from five to fifteen, and it is still said that it is not enough. As a result, the work in the factory department is busy and chaotic, the organization is becoming more and more inflated, and people are doing nothing. There are many people issuing orders above, and no one is responsible for the shifts below. What kind of organization is this for a production unit!"

　　As long as the machine is running, someone must lead

　　When the factory workers discussed the institutional reform plan, they put forward a general slogan: As long as the machine is running, someone must lead. To reform the organization, it is also necessary to streamline the agency and streamline non-production personnel.

　　Around the hall outside the factory director's office, almost all workshops and workshops have posted big-character posters. Everyone unanimously supports the plan to abolish the workshop-level organization and strengthen the shift system. Foremen and workers have both strongly approved of this plan in discussions. The final determined institutional reform plan for the factory now is: merge some departments, abolish the workshop level; below the factory department, take the workshop as a unit, and directly lead the four shifts. The workshop director is responsible for leading the overall and day shifts, and the three deputy workshop directors lead the early, middle, and late shifts respectively and work shifts. The service departments in the departments and the corresponding functional personnel in the workshops also work shifts. The factory-level Party committee and administration also allocate a certain amount of force to work shifts and take care of shift work. After this reorganization, the factory will reduce cadres by 40%-50%.

　　The factory director said confidently: "To be honest, we are taking some risks in doing this. However, everyone has a lot of confidence. With this reorganization, our management agency will be streamlined and flexible, and non-production expenditures can be greatly reduced. The extra cadres can be delegated to exercise, some can be supplemented to the shift leadership; and some can be strengthened to the research of new technologies."

　　New problems under the new situation

　　The branch secretary's return to the workshop and the management agency's orientation to production cannot completely overcome some of the shortcomings in political work exposed in the rectification campaign, and require a long period of exploration and effort. The No. 2 State Cotton Mill has put the problem on the agenda.

　　One is to overcome the triviality and formalism in political work. The Party committee secretary emphasized to me the current competition, appraisal, and reward issues in textile factories. She said: "After years of work since liberation, the production of the current textile factories is relatively stable and normal. According to the original production indicators, most of the workers in many workshops can complete them on time, and the gap between the advanced and the backward is small. However, our leaders still issue a production plan once a month in the old way, and revise the competition guarantee conditions once a week; and select advanced producers once a quarter. Because everyone can complete the plan, when evaluating, we have to add conditions such as good unity and mutual assistance, and good labor discipline. These conditions are difficult to have a standard. Therefore, on weekdays, workers suffer from too many meetings, and the results of the evaluation do not encourage the advanced to lead the backward, and sometimes it becomes a factor that makes the workers not united. This is how the workers raised many opinions about the evaluation during the rectification campaign. In the future, it is necessary to improve the competition indicators, evaluation conditions, evaluation methods, and procedures according to the new situation."

　　Another serious problem exposed in the rectification campaign is the issue of educating Party members to learn how to do political work. Many Party members have good intentions, but do not understand the methods and methods, which arouse resentment from the masses. For example, if a worker in the workshop does not follow the operating procedures, the Party member will go and criticize them in a finger-pointing way. Visiting the homes of the masses is a good thing in itself, and many Party members are also very enthusiastic, but because the purpose is not clear and there is a lack of contact with the masses on weekdays, some masses mistakenly believe that the Party members are going to investigate their economic life. Now the Party members have changed their working methods. This year, the Party organization of the entire factory launched a movement for Party members to make friends, proposing to "restore old relationships" with old friends who have been estranged, and to make new friends with those who have no old friends. So far, 80% of the Party members in the entire factory have made friends, and the masses have responded very well.

　　In addition, some branch secretaries used to be accustomed to solving problems anytime and anywhere on a case-by-case basis. Now, a branch secretary has to lead the political work of several work sections (equivalent to the original workshop). It is no longer possible to use the old working methods. It is necessary to be good at identifying the mainstream of current production and thinking from the complicated things, and to carry out principled and planned leadership. This is not something that every branch secretary can immediately do. For example, regarding the issue of the branch secretary's professional and cultural learning, the Party committee is also making further arrangements.

　　Everything is just the beginning, just an attempt. However, from the facts of the past month or so, people have already seen the gratifying results.

　　Revolutionary vigor! Bold attempt! This is how this factory started the great leap forward in the second five-year plan. (Special contribution to this newspaper)

### 大胆的改革

　　大胆的改革
　　新华社记者　高洁
    上海国棉二厂在这次整风中，进行了两项重要的改革。一项是车间党支部书记从去年12月初开始全部回到生产岗位，一面当工人，一面作支部工作；一项是全厂的党群工作组织、管理机构，特别是直接领导生产的工场和车间管理机构，跟生产工人一样改为三班。这项改革现在正在进行。
    对这样的变革，上海工业界有的人赞同，也有不少人怀疑，担心这样做会带来企业管理工作和政治工作上的混乱。
    不脱产能行吗？
    人们比较普遍的疑问是：像国棉二厂这样的大厂，一个车间有二、三百人，过去支部书记脱离生产尚且没有搞好，现在完全不脱产能行吗？
    我在国棉二厂访问了好几天，同党委书记、党委委员、车间支部书记、工会主席等进行过多次谈话。我得到的回答都是肯定而简单的。他们一致说：能行，而且比脱产的时候做得更好了。一个多月来的情况是：群众满意，党群关系出现了新的气象。
    党委书记邬凌秋一再告诉我：“到现在为止，还没有一个支部书记向我讲干不了的。相反，大多数支部书记都说现在工作好做了；有的眼前虽然有些困难，但是没有一个人退缩。”
    她说：“整风开始的时候，各车间的工人几乎都对支部书记提了很多意见。有的工人对调动工作不满意，有的因为没有评上奖，有的没有得到补助金，有的小组工人互相吵骂，等等，都来责怪支部书记。很多明明不是支部书记应该过问的事，也怪到支部书记头上。”
    一向比较沉静的党委书记，当说起这番话的时候，还显得有些激动。她说：“群众鸣放出来的这些意见，真使我们大吃一惊。我们的支部书记原来都是生产中的优秀工人，群众关系极好。而现在竟成了群众意见最多的人。为什么？我们研究以后发现，问题正出在支部书记脱离生产的缘故上。因为支部书记脱离生产，支委、车间工会和共青团的干部都不脱产，于是，行政干部遇到有调皮捣蛋的工人，要支部书记去批评、教育，车间里下达生产计划、评比奖励、困难补助、工人吵架骂人、等等事务，都推给支部书记去干。结果，支部书记把绝大部分的精力和时间包揽了行政、工会、共青团的事务和对占车间里百分之零点几的落后工人进行思想教育，对其余99％以上的工人，反倒没有时间去进行工作，脱离了广大的群众。”
    支部书记们在讨论了群众的意见以后，立即坚决要求回到生产中去，回到群众中去。工会、行政、共青团的干部和全体党员都极力支持他们回去。群众更是表现了巨大的热情，纷纷争着要支部书记回到自己的班、组去生产。三纺细纱车间支部书记马永贤，在鸣放中群众对他贴了二十多张大字报，占了群众对支部意见的大部分。但是，当他回车间生产的第一天，群众就关心地问他：“你几年不干了，干得了吗？”有的勉励他说：“回来了，了解了实际情况，工作就做得好了。”
    下去以后
    支部书记回到车间后的第一个大变化，是全体支委、党员都积极主动地做政治工作，过去那种遇事推给支部书记或是相互推诿的现象没有了。一纺细纱车间党员工长王秀之，过去碰到有思想问题的工人，就推给支部书记去说服教育。自从支部书记回车间生产以后，她自己解决了一个老女工的派工问题。三纺细纱车间十八个党员，过去只有十二人做政治工作比较经常，现在这种党员已经上升为十七人。只有一人暂时还借口孩子多、家务忙，不大干工作。很多党员提出：不管有多少工作，我们党员每人干一刻钟，就能顶上支部书记一人干一天。
    更重要的是支部书记直接参加生产以后，发现了一些过去不能发现的问题。例如印染工场工人的生产指标问题，过去行政干部认为印染生产是连续自动化的，很难确定某一工人在生产中的具体任务和奋斗方向。不参加生产的支部书记，很难说出这样看法不对。因此，工场行政布置工作时，只提出全工场的要求，对工人不提具体要求；完不成计划时，只能从技术措施上找原因。这次支部书记下去生产，才听到好多工人反映说：个人没有具体方向，我们生产好像瞎子，跟着机器走，不能主动。经过大家研究后得出的结论是：只要有工人操作，就能订指标。生产虽是连续的，但要工人去掌握，如何掌握？应该注意什么、防止什么？这些就是指标的内容。
    不再悬在半空中
    支部书记们的普遍感觉，是现在不再悬在半空中，工作更踏实了，而且有时间学习了。三纺乙班支部书记马永贤告诉我：“过去我的工作情况是，上班时间工人在生产，不能下车间，不下去又没事干，只好成天动脑筋找副工长、工会组长等来汇报；因为听来的情况都是间接的，谈不上深入。学习呢，更糟。上班时间不好学，下了班，工人放工了，我更忙。我经常是从早上六、七点钟忙到夜里九、十点钟，从脱产到现在，没有正规上夜校学习过，平日看报的时间也很少。连我的爱人对我也有意见。她说：别人也当干部，就没看见像你那样忙的”。
    马永贤现在谈起这些，还带着几分无可奈何的神气。谈到现在，他可是浑身来劲了。他说：“现在好了，目前我是一个工区的代理副工长，从一个工区，我可以了解全工段的动向和问题。别的工段都有支委联系，大部分党员也主动干工作。现在开起支委会或是支部大会来，因为大家都了解情况，就不像过去那样，要么支部书记一人说了算，要么拖拖拉拉二三小时搞不清。现在都是三刻钟到一小时解决问题。工作安排好了，大家分头干。现在，我每天下班以后，顶多停留一、二小时就没事了。”
    马永贤已决定在春节后恢复上业余中学。
    不是一个人的问题
    当然，问题并不是支部书记一人回车间生产就完全解决了。支部书记回车间生产以后，要求全体支委、党员更好地在车间里发挥核心骨干作用，共同做好政治工作。这样，改组原来的支部组织形式，便成为非常迫切的问题。
    原来的车间支部是以车间为单位组成的，分散在早、中、晚三班，同长日班的党员和支委互不碰头，要召开一次支委会和支部大会都很困难，这也是形成过去支部书记一人决定事情、包揽事务的原因。现在，这个厂已经重新改组支部，以工场（包括生产一种成品如纱、布、色布的各个工段在内）为单位，按轮班组织支部，支委分布在各个工段。这样，同一个支部的支部书记、支委、工人的作息时间完全相同，联系大大方便了。
    支部书记因生产和基层党组织变动，也迫使包括工厂党委在内的各个领导部门，不能不改变老一套的工作方法和工作作风。
    老一套行不通
    张明厂长告诉我，他最近写了一篇幽默小品，假想一个下厂了解情况的干部按老一套方法工作的结果。支部书记已经回去生产了，他还是按照机关工作时间下来跑情况，硬把正在生产的支部书记找到办公室向他谈情况。结果使那个支部书记一次出了几匹次布。另一次只好关了车去应付他的访问。这完全是可能的。过去，上级机关有什么临时任务布置下来，或是明天要来检查工作，党委或厂部打一下电话，就把支部书记找来汇报一通；平日往下贯彻工作也是层层下达。因此，党委可以不出办公室指挥全厂、应付上级。
    现在，厂的党委已决定把目前全厂六十多个脱产的党群工作干部精简一半以上，党委委员和专职工作人员只留下十人，工会和共青团专职干部只留十二人。党委委员也都分散下去，一人包干领导几个支部，具体帮助下面进行工作。因此，根本改变了层层汇报情况、层层下达指示的作法。
    根据纺织工厂日夜三班连续生产的特点，政治工作活动一般都集中在中午十二时以后到晚上十时以前的中班时间内。因此，党委及其他政治工作人员都改做中班，便于联系各个班的支部书记和群众。遇有国内外发生重大事件，或在一定时期内布置中心工作时，就由党委直接分班下达到全体支委，甚至全体党员。这样，使支委和党员直接了解领导意图，也减少了会议和节省了时间。党委真正成了全厂政治工作的指挥部。党委领导也从大量会议中解脱出来。
    怎样才是面向生产？
    随着支部书记回到生产岗位和党的组织形式的改变，这个厂紧跟着提出了管理机构面向生产的问题。主管部门最近已经同意这个厂的管理机构进行改组，原则上自工场长以下的管理干部和服务部门（如卫生室、公共事业科等）的干部，全都跟班工作。
    厂长说：管理机构面向生产的问题，党在好几年前就已经提出。但是，过去几年，我们实际是只面向了车间，而车间本身也和厂部一样是机关化的。机器日夜二十四小时在不停地转动，二十四小时都有工人在生产，我们的管理干部却是90％的人只在白天八小时内工作。全厂每班有一千三百多工人生产，生产价值七十多万元，而干部跟班工作的只是几十个仅有一般工作水平的工长，全厂有三分之二的生产时间，几乎是在无人领导下进行的。二十四小时内生产上、生活上都可能发生问题，都会有人生病、有人请假，这就出现了每天早上夜班工人放工等天亮，排队候医生、候干部、候车间主任请示工作等等不正常现象。难道这能算是面向生产吗？
    “我从1951年来这个厂，干部从三百多人增加到六百多人，但绝大部分都增加到科室。二十四小时的事，全集中在白天八小时干，计算机从五部增加到十五部，还叫不够用。其结果是厂部科室工作忙忙乱乱，机构越来越膨胀，人浮于事。上面发号施令的人多，下面轮班里无人负责。这哪里像个生产单位的组织！”
    只要机器在转就要有人领导
    全厂职工在讨论机构改革方案的时候，提出了一个总的口号：只要机器在转，就要有人领导。要改革组织，还要精简机构，精简非生产人员。
    在厂长室外面的大厅四周，几乎所有的工场和车间都贴了大字报。大家一致拥护撤销车间一级组织，加强轮班的方案。工长和工人们在讨论中，更是双手赞成这个方案。全厂现在最后确定的机构改革方案是：合并一部分科室，取消车间一级；厂部以下，以工场为单位，下面直接领导四个轮班。由正工场长负责领导全面和常日班，三个副工场长分别领导早、中、晚三个班，跟班工作。科室中的服务部门和工场中相应的职能人员也跟班工作。厂一级的党委和行政，也分出一定力量跟班，照顾轮班工作。这样改组以后，全厂将减少干部40％——50％。
    厂长很有信心地说：“老实讲，我们这样做有些冒险。但是，大家信心很高。这样改组，我们的管理机构精干灵活了，非生产开支可以大大缩减。多出的干部，一部分可以下放锻炼，一部分充实轮班领导；还有一部分，可以加强对新技术的研究。”
    新形势下的新问题
    支部书记回到车间，管理机构面向生产，都还不能彻底克服整风中暴露出来的另一些政治工作中的缺点，还需要较长时间的摸索和努力。国棉二厂已把问题提到日程上来了。
    一是克服政治工作中的繁琐和形式主义。党委书记很强调地向我谈起当前纺织厂中的竞赛评比奖励问题。她说：“经过解放后几年来的工作，当前纺织厂的生产比较稳定、正常，按照原来的生产指标，很多车间的大部分工人都能按期完成，先进和落后的差距很少。但是，我们领导仍然老一套地每月下达一次生产计划，每周修订一次竞赛保证条件；每季评选一次先进生产者。因为大家都能完成计划，评的时候，只好加进些团结互助好、劳动纪律好等等条件。这些条件又很难有个标准。因此，平日工人苦于会议多，评比的结果没有鼓励先进带动落后，有时反成了工人们不团结的因素。整风中间，工人对评比提了很多意见，就是这样来的。今后对竞赛的指标、评比条件和评比方式、手续都有必要根据新的情况加以改进。”
    整风中暴露出的另一个严重问题，是教育党员学会做政治工作的问题。很多党员用心很好，但不懂得方式方法，引起群众反感。例如车间里有工人不执行操作法，党员就去指手划脚地批评一通。访问群众家庭本来是件好事，许多党员也很热心，但因为目的性不明确，平日同群众缺少联系，因此，有些群众就误以为党员是去调查他们的经济生活。现在党员们改变了工作方式。今年元旦，全厂党组织又发起了一次党员交朋友运动，提出有疏远了老朋友的“恢复旧关系”，没有老朋友的交新朋友。到现在，全厂80％的党员都交了朋友，群众反映非常好。
    此外，有的支部书记过去习惯于随时随地就事论事地解决问题。现在，一个支部书记要领导好几个工段（相当原来的车间）的政治工作，再用旧的工作方法就不行。必须善于从纷繁的事物中，找出当前生产、思想中的主流，进行有原则、有计划的领导。这不是每一个支部书记都立即能够做到的。又如关于支部书记的业务、文化学习问题，党委也在作进一步的安排。
    一切都仅是开始，仅是尝试。然而，从一个多月来的事实当中，人们已经看出了可喜的效果。
    革命的干劲！大胆的尝试！这个厂就这样开始了第二个五年计划的大跃进。　（本报特约稿）
