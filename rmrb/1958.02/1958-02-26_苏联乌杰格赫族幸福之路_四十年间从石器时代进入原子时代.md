Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: According to TASS, the Udege people, a minority group living deep in the vast forests of the southern Soviet Far East, have advanced from the Stone Age to the age of electricity and atomic energy in just forty years. This is a great achievement brought about by the October Revolution for the formerly backward minority nationalities.

    The famous Far East explorer V. Arseniev still called the Udege people of that time "forest people" at the beginning of this century. They lived by hunting and fishing. The Udege people roamed in the depths of the dense forests, wore animal skins, and did not even know the most primitive methods of smelting metal.

    The Soviet regime gave the Udege people equal rights with other large and small nationalities of the Soviet Union, bringing new and modern life to this small ethnic group.

    The Udege people still live in the depths of the Ussuri forest, near the Sikhote-Alin Mountains, mainly by hunting and fishing. But they are no longer the semi-civilized nomads of the past. The state has helped them settle permanently, building houses, schools, hospitals, clubs, and shops. The largest Udege town has regular air links with the industrial and administrative centers of the Far East. The Udege people, who originally had no written language, eliminated illiteracy a few years ago. Many Udege people have completed higher education and returned to their hometowns as teachers and doctors.

    The Udege people have organized fishing and hunting labor combinations. The "Bikin" labor combination alone has been granted a hunting ground equivalent to the territory of Belgium and the Netherlands. Some fishing and hunting labor combinations began to rent airplanes two years ago, and hunters flew to remote and wild dense forest areas and transported sheepskins from there.

    The Udege people are also successfully developing other side businesses, such as collecting ginseng.

    苏联乌杰格赫族幸福之路
    四十年间从石器时代进入原子时代
    新华社25日讯据塔斯社报道：居住在苏联远东南部大森林深处的一个少数民族——乌杰格赫族的人民，在短短四十年间就从石器时代进入了电气和原子能时代。这是十月革命给过去落后的少数民族带来的一个伟大成果。
    著名的远东考察家弗·阿尔先尼叶夫在本世纪的初期还把当时的乌杰格赫人叫做“森林人”。他们以狩猎和捕鱼为生。乌杰格赫人在密林深处游牧，穿着兽皮，甚至不懂得最原始的冶炼金属的方法。
    苏维埃政权使乌杰格赫族同苏联其他各大小民族获得了平等的权利，给这个小民族带来了新的现代化的生活。
    乌杰格赫人现在仍居住在乌苏里森林深处，在希霍特阿林山脉附近，主要靠打猎和捕鱼为生。但是他们已经不是过去那种半开化的游牧人了。国家帮助他们永久定居下来，建筑了房屋、学校、医院、俱乐部和商店。最大的一座乌杰格赫城镇同远东的工业和行政中心有定期的航空联系。原来没有本民族文字的乌杰格赫人在几年前已经消灭文盲。有很多乌杰格赫人受完了高等教育，回到他们的故乡作教师和医生。
    乌杰格赫族人组织了渔猎劳动组合。仅“比金”劳动组合就得到一块相当于比利时和荷兰领土的大猎场。有些渔猎劳动组合在两年前开始租用飞机，猎手们乘飞机到遥远和野兽很多的密林地带去，并从那里把羊皮运出来。
    乌杰格赫人也在顺利地发展着其他的副业，如采集人参等。
