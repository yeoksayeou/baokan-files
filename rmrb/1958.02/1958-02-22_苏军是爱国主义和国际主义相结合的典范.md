    The Soviet Army is a Model of Combining Patriotism and Internationalism
    Marshal of the People's Republic of China He Long
    February 23rd marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the great Soviet Army and Navy. In the current international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, it is of great significance for us to celebrate this glorious festival.
    The glorious Soviet Army is the world's first truly people's army – the socialist army of workers and peasants led by the Communist Party. This army was established according to the principles instructed by Lenin. At that time, Lenin fully demonstrated the necessity of establishing a new type of revolutionary army, and he regarded smashing the old army and establishing a new army as the "first key to revolutionary victory" and as the fundamental guarantee for the workers and peasants to grasp all power and consolidate this power. He said: "...the task is very clear, we cannot survive if we do not arm ourselves to defend the socialist republic." For forty years, the Soviet Army under the leadership of the Communist Party has practiced Lenin's instruction, gloriously completed its historical mission, and has been tempered into a powerful and invincible revolutionary army in the great struggle to defend the achievements of the October Revolution, defend the socialist motherland, defend world peace, and defend the cause of human progress.
    The glorious Soviet Army is an army armed by the Communist Party with Marxism-Leninism, and it is an army with a high degree of communist consciousness. Soviet soldiers are infinitely loyal to their socialist motherland and all ethnic groups, and at the same time, they are infinitely loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism. Loving the people of one's own country and loving the people of other countries, defending the socialist motherland and defending world peace are completely consistent for Soviet soldiers. This consistency of patriotism and internationalism reflects the essence of a people's army and becomes the source of an eternally invincible and powerful force.
    The birth of the world's first socialist country aroused the malicious hatred of international imperialists. In the past forty years, the Soviet Army has been forced to engage in life-and-death struggles against imperialist aggression twice, and both times it emerged as the victor.
    From 1918 to 1921, the interventionist forces of fourteen imperialist countries, including the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, colluded with the Russian White bandits, attempting to strangle the young Soviet regime in its cradle and turn the Soviet people, who had already gained freedom, back into slaves. Millions of workers, enraged, responded to the call of the Communist Party and the government, and under the battle flag of the young Red Army, rose up to defend the freedom and independence of the Soviet motherland. They overcame unimaginable difficulties and finally drove the interventionist forces and White bandits, armed to the teeth, out of Soviet territory. The first attack by international imperialism on the Soviet regime suffered a complete defeat.
    The victory of the Soviet Army defended the socialist motherland from aggression, defended the fortress of the world's proletariat and socialist revolution, fundamentally shook the rule of imperialism, and gave the international proletariat and oppressed nations infinite hope, confidence, and courage. Obviously, this victory itself contained the content and significance of patriotism and internationalism; it was not only a victory for the Soviet working people, but also a common victory for the world's proletariat. The reason why the young Soviet state was able to defeat the joint offensive of powerful domestic and foreign enemies under extremely difficult circumstances was precisely because the armed workers and peasants had a lofty goal. Regarding this point, Lenin made a clear analysis at the Eighth Congress of the Party, he said: "...the reason why this war can be carried out with increased perseverance and heroism is only because for the first time in the world an army that knows why it is fighting, an armed force, has been established, only because the workers and peasants who have suffered incredible hardships have for the first time clearly realized that they are defending the Soviet Socialist Republic, defending the regime of the working people ruling the capitalists, and realizing that they are defending the cause of the world's proletarian socialist revolution."
    From 1941 to 1945, the Soviet Army, with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, withstood the most severe and arduous test of the Great Patriotic War and created unprecedented miracles.
    In June 1941, the German fascist invaders, perfidiously and suddenly attacked the Soviet Union. This was the second attempt by international imperialist forces to eliminate the Soviet state by force. At that time, the fascist invaders possessed almost the entire economic power and manpower of Europe, and at a decisive moment, the Soviet Union alone bore the brunt of the enemy's millions of troops. Hitler's bandits were confident of an easy victory, but this calculation was wrong again. With a formidable enemy at hand, the Soviet Communist Party called on the people of the whole country to concentrate all their efforts to crush the enemy. After four years of heroic sacrifice and arduous struggle, the Soviet Army not only stopped the offensive of the German fascist bandits, but also drove them back to their lairs and completely wiped them out. In the Second World War, the Soviet Army gloriously became the main force in defeating fascist aggressors worldwide.
    The Soviet people's infinite love for their socialist motherland and their extreme hatred for the enemy ignited the flames of national resistance. "Everything for the front," "Everything for victory," people of all ethnic groups actively supported the war from all aspects and in various ways. This unity of the entire military and civilian population, the unity of the front and the rear, greatly encouraged the Soviet Army. Soviet soldiers concentrated the best qualities of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union: fortitude, bravery, hard work, and the most profound Soviet patriotism. Such an army, as Friedrich Engels predicted in a speech in February 1845, when talking about defending the future communist society: "...once a war breaks out, the members of this society will definitely defend their true homeland, their true home, therefore they will fight with invigorated spirit and bravery, causing even mechanized modern armies to flee at the mere sight of them. If you think about the miracles created by the revolutionary army during the period from 1792 to 1799, an army that fought with emotional fervor for just an illusion, for an imagined homeland, you will understand what kind of power an army fighting not for an illusion, but for a real and tangible goal, will possess." In the war, Soviet soldiers created thousands upon thousands of mythical heroic images and established thousands upon thousands of immortal achievements. These heroic images and achievements, like inextinguishable flames, will forever inspire people to serve the motherland loyally.
    On November 7, 1941, when Hitler's bandits had already broken into the vicinity of Moscow, Stalin issued a call to the Soviet Army troops: "The whole world is watching you, believing that you are the force capable of eliminating the German aggressor bandits. The people of European countries enslaved under the shackles of the German aggressors are watching you, believing that you are their liberators. The great mission of liberation has fallen on your shoulders." These words represented the wishes of the people of Europe and the world at that time. The glorious Soviet soldiers did not disappoint these expectations. Just as the dark clouds of Hitler's bandits enveloped the whole of Europe, just as the shame of being enslaved threatened all of humanity, people all over the world saw the noble internationalist qualities of Soviet soldiers – they loved the working people, and for the freedom and happiness of the working people, they were willing to give their lives. When Soviet soldiers fought to liberate some countries in Europe and Asia occupied by the enemy, they showed the same loyalty and bravery as when they were liberating their own country.
    In the Second World War, the Soviet Army solemnly fulfilled its internationalist mission, not only defending the honor, freedom, and independence of its own socialist motherland, but also helping the people of some countries in Europe and Asia to win genuine freedom and independence. The birth of a series of new socialist countries, forming the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, fundamentally changed the world situation. The result of the great victory of the Soviet Army, on the one hand, helped others to gain liberation, and on the other hand, gained the support of millions of liberated people. This noble behavior of patriotism and internationalism being consistent with each other precisely reflected the inevitable requirements of the international proletariat and the liberation struggle of the working people; it reflected the consistency of the fundamental interests of the proletariat worldwide, the consistency of the interests of the liberation struggle between proletariats of various countries; it reflected the truth that the proletariat, in order to achieve its own liberation, must liberate all of mankind.
    In the post-war years, the Soviet Union maintained friendly, cooperative, united, and mutually supportive relations with various fraternal countries. Soviet soldiers and the armies of various fraternal countries stood shoulder to shoulder guarding the outposts of socialism and world peace. The fraternal unity between the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the existence of a powerful Soviet Union and its army, became the most reliable guarantee for various countries to consolidate revolutionary victories and ensure national security and independence. Everyone only needs to think for a moment to understand why the first socialist country suffered two frenzied aggressions by international imperialism, while the socialist countries born after the Second World War have generally not suffered that kind of serious attack? This is clearly due to the existence of a powerful Soviet Army, due to the fact that these countries have formed close alliances with the Soviet Union, making the imperialist aggressor forces not dare to act rashly, and when they do act rashly, they will immediately be crushed. The Hungarian incident in October 1956 most clearly proved this point. As everyone knows, the Hungarian counter-revolutionary armed rebellion "was the most serious attack on the socialist camp by imperialism since the Korean War." ("On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" - Second Edition) At the request of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, the Soviet Army resolutely sent troops to aid the Hungarian people in defeating this attack by the enemy. This noble internationalist act of resolutely defending the interests of socialist countries from infringement not only conformed to the highest interests of the Hungarian people, but also conformed to the highest interests of the Soviet people, socialist countries, and the working people of the world.
    The Soviet Army's lofty and unparalleled friendship and assistance to the Chinese people is even more unforgettable for all time.
    We will never forget the heroic deeds of the Soviet volunteer airmen. At the very beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, these outstanding sons and daughters of the Soviet people came to China, and together with the Chinese people created countless glorious achievements, fiercely attacking the frenzied arrogance of the Japanese invaders and inspiring the Chinese people's fighting will. Comrade Kulichenko's last words before his glorious sacrifice for the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people fully expressed the noble class feeling of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. Kulichenko said: "To tell the truth, I experience the disasters of the Chinese working people as if I were experiencing the disasters of my own country. Every time I see buildings destroyed by Japanese planes and people fleeing in panic, I feel sad!"
    We will never forget the greatest assistance that the Soviet Army gave to China in the final struggle to defeat the Japanese aggressors. In August 1945, the Great Patriotic War, which had lasted for four years of hard fighting, had just ended, and the Soviet Army immediately turned its guns eastward, and with overwhelming force, in one fell swoop, destroyed the fortified area built by the Japanese bandits in Northeast China for fourteen years, annihilated the enemy's elite Kwantung Army, forced Japan to announce its unconditional surrender, liberated tens of millions of people in Northeast China, and accelerated the historical process of the entire Chinese People's Revolution. In the history of the Chinese people's liberation cause, the glorious Soviet soldiers wrote an immortal heroic epic.
    We will always cherish the days when the Soviet Army lived with us in Lushun and Dalian. After defeating the Japanese aggressors, in order to prevent the resurgence of imperialist aggression and to protect the young China from aggression, the heroic Soviet soldiers generously assisted us in undertaking the important responsibility of guarding the Lushunkou naval base. Soviet soldiers, with the same loyalty as they had for their motherland, spent difficult years with us and protected China's security and peace in the East together with us. It was not until China's defense forces grew and consolidated that the Soviet Army withdrew to their motherland and transferred all the equipment in Lushunkou to our country free of charge. Isn't this sincere assistance and brotherly friendship the most noble expression of internationalism?
    As Comrade Mao Zedong once emphasized, if there had been no existence of the Soviet Union, if there had been no victory in the anti-fascist Second World War, if there had been no overthrow of Japanese imperialism... the Chinese revolution could not have been victorious. The Soviet Army helped the Chinese people to achieve victory, and the victorious Chinese people established a solid alliance of friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation with the great Soviet Union, reflecting the common will and common interests of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.
    In short, the forty years of glorious history of the Soviet Army is a living history of the combination of patriotism and internationalism, a history of heroic struggle to defend the achievements of the world's proletarian socialist revolution and to oppose imperialist aggression. The formation of the current new historical situation, in which the socialist forces have surpassed the imperialist forces, is inseparable from the forty years of glorious history of the Soviet Army.
    Why can the Soviet Army become an invincible army that loves the working people of its own country and the working people of the whole world? The most fundamental reason is that it is an army directly led by the proletarian party – the Communist Party, educated with Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and grown up in the long and arduous struggle against all enemies of socialism. The members of this army all have a high degree of communist consciousness; they hate all class oppression and the system of man exploiting man; they regard the consistency of the interests of the working people of their own country and the interests of the working people of the whole world as the highest interest; they firmly believe that "the proletariat will inevitably defeat the bourgeoisie, socialism will inevitably defeat capitalism, and the oppressed nations will inevitably defeat

    苏军是爱国主义和国际主义相结合的典范
    中华人民共和国元帅  贺龙
    2月23日，是伟大的苏联陆海军建军四十周年。在当前东风压倒西风的国际局势下，我们来庆祝这个光辉的节日，是有重要意义的。
    光荣的苏联军队，是世界上第一支真正的人民军队——共产党领导的社会主义的工农劳动人民的军队。这支军队是根据列宁指示的原则建立的。当时，列宁曾经充分地论证了建立一支新型革命军队的必要性，他把粉碎旧军队，建立新军队看成是“革命胜利的第一要诀”，看成是工农掌握全部政权并巩固这个政权的根本保证。他说：“……任务是明明白白的，如果不武装保卫社会主义共和国，那我们是不能生存的。”四十年来，在共产党领导下的苏联军队，实践了列宁的这一指示，光荣地完成了自己的历史使命，并在保卫十月革命成果、保卫社会主义祖国、保卫世界和平和人类进步事业的伟大斗争中，锻炼成为一支强大无敌的革命军队。
    光荣的苏联军队，是共产党用马克思列宁主义思想武装起来的军队，是一支具有高度共产主义觉悟的军队。苏军战士无限忠诚于自己的社会主义祖国和各族人民，同时又无限忠诚于无产阶级的国际主义原则。热爱祖国人民和热爱他国人民，保卫社会主义祖国和保卫世界和平，对苏联军人来说，是完全一致的。这种爱国主义和国际主义思想的一致，反映了人民军队的本质，并成为永远不可战胜的强大力量的源泉。
    世界上第一个社会主义国家的诞生，引起了国际帝国主义者的恶毒憎恨。苏联军队四十年来，曾两度被迫对帝国主义侵略势力进行过生死较量，并且两次都成了胜利者。
    1918年至1921年，美、英、法、日等十四个帝国主义的干涉军和俄国白匪军勾结起来，企图把年青的苏维埃政权绞杀在摇篮里，把业已获得自由的苏联人民，重新变成奴隶。被激怒了的千百万劳动者，纷纷响应共产党和政府的号召，在青年红军的战斗旗帜下，奋起捍卫苏维埃祖国的自由和独立。他们克服了难以想像的艰难困苦，终于把武装到牙齿的干涉军和白匪军，赶出了苏联的领土。国际帝国主义对苏维埃政权的第一次进攻，遭到彻底的失败。
    苏联军队的胜利，保卫了社会主义祖国不受侵犯，保卫了全世界无产阶级社会主义革命的堡垒，从根本上动摇了帝国主义的统治，而给予国际无产阶级和被压迫民族以无限的希望、信心和勇气。很显然，这个胜利本身就包含了爱国主义和国际主义的内容和意义，它不仅是苏联劳动人民的胜利，而且也是全世界无产阶级的共同胜利。年青的苏维埃国家，所以能够在极困难的情况下战胜国内外强大敌人的联合进攻，正是由于武装起来的工农群众，具有一种崇高的目的。关于这一点，列宁在党的第八次代表大会上曾作了明确的分析，他说：“……这个战争之所以能以提高了的毅力和英勇精神来进行，那只是因为在世界上第一次建立了知道为什么要打仗的一支军队，一支武装力量，那只是因为遭受到难以相信的艰苦牺牲的工人和农民在世界上第一次清楚地意识到，他们在保卫苏维埃社会主义共和国，保卫劳动者统治资本家的政权，意识到他们正在保卫全世界无产阶级社会主义革命的事业。”
    1941年至1945年，苏联军队以高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，经受了卫国战争中最严厉和最艰巨的考验，创立了史无前例的奇迹。
    1941年6月，德国法西斯侵略者，背信弃义地突然向苏联进攻，是国际帝国主义势力妄图用武力消灭苏维埃国家的第二次尝试。那个时候，法西斯侵略者几乎拥有整个欧洲的经济力量和人力，而且在决定性的时间里，苏联单独承受着敌人几百万军队的进攻。希特勒匪徒满以为可以轻易取胜，可是这种算盘又打错了。大敌当前，苏联共产党号召全国人民，集中全力粉碎敌人。经过四年的英勇牺牲和艰苦奋斗，苏联军队不仅阻止了德国法西斯匪军的进攻，并且把它赶回老巢，彻底消灭。在第二次世界大战中，苏联军队光荣地成为在世界范围内战胜法西斯侵略者的主力。
    苏维埃人民对于社会主义祖国的无限热爱，和对于敌人的极端仇恨，燃起了全民抗战的烈火，“一切为了前线”，“一切为了胜利”，各族人民从各个方面用各种方法积极支援战争。这种全国军民一致，前后方一致，极大地鼓舞着苏联军队。苏军战士集中了苏联各族人民最优秀的品质：刚毅、勇敢、刻苦和最深刻的苏维埃爱国主义。这样的军队，正像弗·恩格斯早在1845年2月的一次演说中，谈到保卫将来的共产主义社会时所预言的那样：“……一旦发生战争，这个社会的成员，一定会保卫真正的祖国、真正的家园，因此他们将精神焕发、坚毅勇敢的作战，使受过机械化训练的现代化军队也要望风披靡。你们想一想，在1792年到1799年这个时期革命军队，即仅仅为了一种幻想，为了想像的祖国而战的军队因情绪激昂而作出了怎样的奇迹，你们就会明白，不是为了幻想，而是为了一个实在的可以捉摸的目标而战的军队将具有什么样的力量。”在战争中，苏军战士们创造了千千万万个神话般的英雄形象，建立了千千万万个不朽的功勋，这些英雄形象和功勋，像扑不灭的火焰一样，永远鼓舞人们忠诚地为祖国服务。
    1941年11月7日，那时希特勒匪军已闯到莫斯科附近，斯大林向苏军部队发出号召说：“全世界都望着你们，认定你们是能够消灭德国侵略者匪军的力量。陷在德国侵略者枷锁下被奴役的欧洲各国人民都望着你们，认定你们是他们的解放者。伟大的解放者使命落到了你们的肩上。”这些话代表了欧洲和全世界人民当时的愿望。光荣的苏军战士，没有辜负人们这种愿望。正当希特勒强盗的乌云笼罩了整个欧洲的时候，正当陷为奴隶的耻辱威胁着全人类的时候，全世界人民都看到了苏联军人那种崇高的国际主义品质——他们热爱劳动人民，他们为了劳动人民的自由和幸福，不惜献出自己的生命。苏军战士在为解放欧洲和亚洲某些敌寇侵占的国家而进行战斗的时候，正像为解放自己的祖国时那样，表现了同样的忠诚和勇敢。
    在第二次世界大战中，苏联军队庄严地完成了国际主义使命，不仅保卫了自己社会主义祖国的荣誉、自由和独立，同时也帮助欧亚两洲一些国家的人民，争得了真正的自由和独立。一系列新的社会主义国家的诞生，形成了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，使世界形势起了根本变化。苏军伟大胜利的结果，一方面帮助别人得到解放，另方面又得到解放了的千百万人民的支持。这种爱国主义和国际主义精神相一致的崇高行为，正是反映了国际无产阶级和劳动人民解放斗争的必然要求；反映了全世界无产阶级的根本利益的一致，各国无产阶级之间的解放斗争的利益的一致；反映了无产阶级要求得自己解放，必须解放全人类的真理。
    在战后的年代里，苏联同各兄弟国家保持了友好合作团结互助的关系，苏军战士同各兄弟国家的军队并肩守卫在社会主义和世界和平的前哨。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国之间的兄弟团结，强大的苏联及其军队的存在，成为各国巩固革命胜利，保障国家安全和独立的最可靠的保证。大家只要稍想一想，就可以明白，为什么第一个社会主义国家遭到国际帝国主义两次疯狂侵略，而第二次世界大战后诞生的社会主义国家却一般的尚未遭到那种严重进攻？这显然是由于有强大苏联军队的存在，由于这些国家同苏联结成了亲密的联盟，使帝国主义侵略势力不敢轻举妄动，并当它轻举妄动的时候，就立即会受到粉碎的打击。在1956年10月匈牙利事件中，最明显地证明了这一点。大家知道，匈牙利反革命武装叛乱，“是帝国主义在侵朝战争以后对于社会主义阵营一次最严重的进攻”。（“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”）苏联军队应匈牙利工农革命政府的请求，毅然出兵援助匈牙利人民打垮了敌人的这次进攻。这种坚决保卫社会主义国家利益不受侵害的崇高的国际主义行为，不仅符合匈牙利人民的最高利益，同时也符合苏联本国人民和社会主义各国以及全世界劳动人民的最高利益。
    苏联军队对中国人民崇高无上的友谊和援助，更是永世难忘的。
    我们永远不会忘记苏联志愿航空队员的英雄事迹。抗日战争才开始，苏联人民的这些优秀儿女就来到了中国，配合中国人民创造了无数的光辉战绩，狠狠地打击了日寇的疯狂气焰，鼓舞了中国人民的战斗意志，为中国人民解放事业而光荣牺牲的库里申科同志生前的留言，充分表达了苏联人民对中国人民的那种高贵的阶级感情。库里申科说：“说实话，我像体验着我的祖国的灾难一样，体验着中国的劳动人民正在遭受着灾难，我每当看到日本飞机炸毁的建筑物和逃难的人就难过！”
    我们永远不会忘记苏联军队在最后打败日本侵略者的斗争中给予中国的最伟大的援助。1945年8月，经历了四年苦战的卫国战争刚刚结束，苏联军队立即挥戈东指，以排山倒海之势，一举摧毁了日寇在我国东北修筑了十四年的要塞地带，歼灭了敌人的精锐部队关东军，迫使日本不得不宣布无条件投降，解放了我国东北地区的几千万人民，加速了整个中国人民革命的历史进程。在中国人民解放事业的历史里，光荣的苏军战士写下了千古不朽的英雄诗篇。
    我们永远怀念着苏军在旅大和我们相处的日子。在打败日本侵略者以后，为了防止帝国主义侵略再起，保卫年青中国不受侵犯，英勇的苏军战士，又慷慨地协助我们担负起守卫旅顺口海军根据地的重大责任，苏军战士像对祖国一样的忠诚，同我们一起度过了艰苦的岁月，同我们一起保卫了中国的安全和东方的和平。直到我国国防力量成长巩固起来的时候，苏联军队才撤返祖国，并把旅顺口的全部设备无偿的移交我国。这种真诚的援助和兄弟般的友谊，难道不是最崇高的国际主义表现吗？
    正如毛泽东同志曾经强调指出过的，假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，假如没有打倒日本帝国主义……中国革命是不能胜利的。苏联军队帮助中国人民取得胜利，胜利了的中国人民，同伟大的苏联建立了巩固的友好互助同盟，反映了中苏两国人民的共同意志和共同利益。
    总之，苏联军队四十年的光荣历史，是一部活生生的爱国主义和国际主义相结合的历史，是一部保卫世界无产阶级社会主义革命成果、反对帝国主义侵略而进行英勇战斗的历史。当前新的历史形势的形成，社会主义力量超过了帝国主义力量，是同苏联军队四十年来的光荣历史分不开的。
    为什么苏联军队能够成为一支热爱本国劳动人民和全世界劳动人民的战无不胜的军队呢？最根本的原因，由于她是在无产阶级的政党——共产党直接领导，以马克思列宁主义思想、无产阶级国际主义思想教养，并在反对一切社会主义敌人的长期艰苦斗争中成长起来的军队。这支军队的成员都具有高度的共产主义觉悟，他们憎恨一切阶级压迫和人剥削人的制度；他们把本国劳动人民利益和全世界劳动人民的利益的一致看成是最高利益；他们确信“无产阶级必然能够战胜资产阶级，社会主义必然能够战胜资本主义，被压迫民族必然能够战胜帝国主义。”（毛泽东同志在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命四十周年会议上的讲话）因此，苏联军队在自己的全部历史过程中，永远是高举着爱国主义和国际主义的旗帜，奋勇前进。
    庆祝苏军建军四十周年，我们中国人民解放军要更好地学习苏军那种崇高的爱国主义和国际主义精神。要努力提高无产阶级的社会主义觉悟，永远忠于马克思列宁主义的无产阶级国际主义原则，不断地巩固和发展中苏两国人民及其军队间的团结友谊，为防止帝国主义的侵略阴谋，为保卫世界和平和我们共同事业的胜利而奋斗！
