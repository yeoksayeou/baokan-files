　　Soviet Union Prepares to Elect Deputies to the Supreme Soviet

    The Entire Country is Divided into 150,000 Electoral Districts and Election Committees are Formed
    Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd Dispatch from Moscow via TASS: Preparations are now underway for the election of the Soviet Supreme Soviet, to be held on March 16th. At the Moscow worker's meetings that began on February 1st, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Shvernik, and others were nominated as candidates for deputies to the Soviet Supreme Soviet.

    The entire staff and workers of the Moscow Searchlight Factory passed a resolution nominating Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as a candidate for Deputy to the Union Soviet from the Kalinin electoral district of Moscow. Workers at factories such as the "Hammer and Sickle" Steel Factory, the Presnya Machine-Building Plant, "Milling Machine," and "Fighter" also nominated Khrushchev as a candidate for deputy.

    In the Red Presnya electoral district, at a workers' meeting at the carriage repair plant, Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, was nominated as a candidate for deputy.

    The staff and workers of the Hard Alloy United Factory passed a resolution nominating Mikoyan, Deputy of the Soviet Council of Ministers and member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as a candidate for Deputy to the Soviet Supreme Soviet from the Dzerzhinsky electoral district of Moscow.

    The staff and workers of the "Moscow Cable" Factory nominated Shvernik, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the Central Committee of the CPSU, as a candidate for Deputy to the Soviet of Nationalities from the Moscow city electoral district.

    Mass meetings to nominate candidates for deputies to the Soviet Supreme Soviet also began on February 1st in cities such as Leningrad, Kiev, Tashkent, and Yerevan.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd Dispatch from Moscow via TASS on January 31st: The work of dividing the electoral districts throughout the Soviet Union and organizing the election committees for each electoral district of the Soviet Supreme Soviet has been completed. There are approximately 150,000 such electoral districts.

    Electoral districts are regional divisions within each electoral area. In order to ensure the most convenient conditions for voting, the establishment of electoral districts took into account that each electoral district should not include too many voters, so that voters would not have to spend too much time voting. In view of this, separate electoral districts are established in hospitals, maternity homes, sanatoriums, veterans' palaces, courts, and on long-distance trains en route on election day.

    The number of residents living in an electoral district does not exceed 3,000, and the smallest has only 25 people. The smallest electoral districts were established on sparsely populated islands and in the northernmost polar outposts.

    The election committees of the districts are composed of representatives nominated by the social organizations of the working people, workers' meetings of enterprises and institutions, soldiers' meetings of troops, farmers' meetings of collective farms and villages, and workers' meetings of state farms. These committees have nearly 1.2 million representatives of the working people.

　　苏联准备选举最高苏维埃代表
    赫鲁晓夫等被提名为候选人
    全国共划分为十五万个选举分区并组成了选举委员会
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃选举将于3月16日举行，现在筹备工作已开始进行。在2月1日开始举行的莫斯科劳动者会议上，赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、米高扬、什维尔尼克等被提名为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人。
    莫斯科探照灯工厂全体职工通过决议，提名苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫为莫斯科市加里宁选区的联盟院代表候选人。“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂、普列斯诺机器制造厂、“铣刀”、“战士”等工厂的职工也提名赫鲁晓夫为代表候选人。
    在红色普列斯诺选区，车厢修理厂的职工大会上，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席、苏共中央委员会主席团委员伏罗希洛夫被提名为代表候选人。
    硬合金联合工厂职工大会通过决议，提名苏联部长会议副主席、苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员米高扬为莫斯科捷尔任斯基选区苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人。
    “莫斯科电缆”工厂职工提名苏共中央委员会主席团委员、苏共中央委员会监察委员会主席什维尔尼克为莫斯科市选区民族院代表候选人。
    列宁格勒、基辅、塔什干和埃里温等城市也从2月1日开始举行群众大会，推选苏联最高苏维埃代表的候选人。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1月31日讯：苏联全国各选举分区的划分工作和苏联最高苏维埃各选举分区选举委员会的组织工作都已经结束。这种选举分区共有十五万个左右。
    选举分区是各选区内在地区上的划分。为了保证使投票有最方便的条件，在成立选举分区时考虑到了使每一个选举分区不要包括太多的选民，以便选民在投票时不用花费很多时间。鉴于此，在病院、产房、疗养院、荣军宫、法院以及在选举日那天正在路上的长途列车上建立单独的选举分区。
    居住在一个选举分区内的居民最多不超过三千人，最少的仅有二十五人。在居民稀少的岛屿上以及最北部的极地驻扎所等地，成立了最小的选举分区。
    分区的选举委员会是由劳动人民的社会团体、企业和机关的职工大会、部队军人大会、集体农庄和乡村的农民大会、国营农场的职工大会所提出的代表组成的。这些委员会的成员中有将近一百二十万名劳动人民的代表。
