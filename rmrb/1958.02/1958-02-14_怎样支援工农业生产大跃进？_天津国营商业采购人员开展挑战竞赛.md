    怎样支援工农业生产大跃进？
    天津国营商业采购人员开展挑战竞赛
    新华社天津12日电　天津国营商业采购供应部门的职工代表，在10日举行促进工农业生产大跃进积极分子誓师大会。各采购供应站的职工们纷纷提出实现大跃进的具体计划，并且互相挑战、应战。
    各单位职工提出的促进工业生产大跃进的计划是：积极扩大工业品的收购计划；加强推销和宣传工作，扩大天津产品的销售市场；采用寻找代用品或节省原料的方法，积极帮助工业部门克服原料不足的困难；收集先进地区的产品样品，供应工业部门改进产品质量时参考。采购供应部门今年进货计划比商业部下达指标扩大了25％。五金机械采购供应站组织工厂增产五千吨盘条，以支援工业生产跃进的需要。石油采购供应站今年将大力推动天津市社会节约石油的工作，在全市推广十几种先进经验，计划全年节约非生产部门使用的汽油、柴油、润滑油三千七百吨，用以供应工业部门。纺织品采购供应站计划大力协助工业部门克服生产上的困难，扩大组织棉麻混纺布三十七万匹，积极推销出去。
    职工们提出的支援农业生产大跃进的计划是：大力组织工厂增产农业生产和兴修水利所需要的各种生产资料；积极了解各地农民需要的生产资料的品种规格，争取作到农业需要什么就供应什么，并且不误农时；对城乡都需要的生产资料和生活资料要优先供应农村。五金机械采购供应站对农业生产需要的铁铣、铅丝、钢镐、鎯头等生产资料，今年的供应量将分别比去年增加一倍到五倍。交通电工器材采购供应站对农民欢迎的手推车，今年供应量将比去年增加近两倍，并在第一季度内利用库存零件组织工厂加工装配三万个手推车轮子，以支援农村需要。
    各单位还提出要贯彻勤俭办企业的方针，改善经营管理，除采取措施加速商品周转降低费用外，今年还要消灭财务会计和运输上的差错事故；在商品保管上要作到无霉坏、无残损、无责任事故，和勤检查、勤整修、勤通风、勤翻晒的“三无”“四勤”。五金机械、针棉织品、化工原料等采购供应站，今年计划降低费用四百二十多万元。
