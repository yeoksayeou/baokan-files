(Our newspaper, Shanghai, February 23rd, reporters Xi Ping and Ji Yin report:) A new high tide of rectification, centered on anti-waste and anti-conservatism and driving overall work, has begun to take shape in factories and enterprises in Shanghai. In the few days around the Spring Festival, the situation developed rapidly, and more and more workers are converging into a torrent under the slogan of "anti-waste, anti-conservatism, comparing with the advanced, comparing with vigor", launching a comprehensive offensive against various backward phenomena.

Despite the fact that these days were around the Spring Festival, the leading cadres and workers of many factories were still busy. Everywhere in the factories, large-character posters exposing waste and conservatism and physical exhibitions criticizing waste and conservatism could be seen. The reporter visited the State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill, which ignited the fire of anti-waste in the city, the other night. The young shock brigade members of this factory were busy arranging an anti-waste physical exhibition under the electric lights. All kinds of exhibits were placed on both sides of the nearly 100-meter-long path from the factory gate to the workshop. The comrades of this factory told the reporter that the workers in their factory were very energetic. On the morning of the 21st, as soon as they started work, the workers organized shock brigades and propaganda teams to check the waste situation in the workshop. Some workers voluntarily moved out the things they had wasted. Within two hours, they collected 350,000 items of various sizes in the whole factory and formed a rich and large-scale exhibition. He excitedly said: Now the situation is developing very fast, and the enthusiasm of the masses has greatly exceeded the estimates of the leadership. The reporter came to the State-owned No. 12 Cotton Mill, which came from behind in the anti-waste campaign, and there was an even more vibrant scene. The factory gate was full of vehicles of all sizes, and the wide aisles were crowded with people. They were representatives from many factories in Shanghai. In the past few days, more than 100 units and more than 10,000 people in the city have come here to visit and exchange experiences. This factory has actually become the center for factories and enterprises in the city to exchange experiences in anti-waste and anti-conservatism.

In this new high tide of airing views, the leading cadres of various factories in Shanghai have mustered revolutionary energy, personally taking the lead in deeply mobilizing and leading the workers to speak out freely, and some have even personally helped the workers write and post big-character posters. Due to the great determination and energy of the leading cadres, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers for airing views has been further encouraged, forming a mass inspection of the implementation of the general line of achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results, with everyone participating and everyone exposing problems. In some factories, the proportion of people writing big-character posters reached 100%, and some people who were usually inactive also actively participated. Judging from the big-character posters posted in various factories, the criticism is directed not only at economic aspects, but also at political ideology and various backward phenomena. Those who regarded anti-waste and anti-conservatism as "just for a few bucks" have begun to change their understanding and have a more comprehensive understanding of the economic and political significance of anti-waste and anti-conservatism, and therefore their consciousness and enthusiasm have greatly increased.

In this new high tide of rectification, the masses in various factories in Shanghai have created and used many lively forms, making the struggle deep and thorough.

The methods of "comparison" and "evaluation" have been widely adopted by many factories, and have undergone new developments. The masses of the Shanghai No. 5 Tobacco Factory implemented the comparison of ideas, methods, and results, to see who had advanced ideas and was not conservative, who had more methods, and who could dig out the economic effects of potential the most, in order to further criticize conservative and complacent thinking. Some departments have also created more methods for investigation and comparison. Like the planning and accounting department, from checking account books, checking data, checking various expense expenditures, checking capital backlog, and checking the gap between advanced and backward months, we can more deeply find waste and tap potential, and through the method of checking ourselves first, then checking within the department, and then checking outside the department and outside the factory, we can continuously expand the results. The factory's target for increasing production and practicing economy has risen from 380,000 yuan to 700,000 yuan recently. Many factories have also created a new form of running exhibitions. The workers moved out the wasted materials and placed them in the open space, wrote their own descriptions, and acted as their own guides; adding and expanding them at any time, without being restricted by form. Doing so is fast and does not cost money. This kind of exhibition, which is run by ourselves, spoken by ourselves, rich in content, lively in form, and has a wide impact, is constantly appearing in many factories in Shanghai. The Shanghai Electricity Meter Factory has launched three anti-waste physical exhibitions. The Shanghai No. 5 Tobacco Factory also launched an anti-waste and anti-conservative exhibition. The materials on the exhibition are all from the "small warehouses" of various departments and workshops in the factory. In the State-owned No. 6 Cotton Mill, the materials on the anti-waste physical exhibition are long enough to be more than two miles long.

Big-character posters have also undergone new developments. Not only are the inside and outside of the factory writing big-character posters to air their views, but factories have also begun to post big-character posters with each other and between factories and administrative management agencies, exposing waste and conservatism. The materials revealed in the factories prove that many rules and regulations that restrict the development of productive forces come from higher-level agencies, and some waste, conservatism, and other collaborative factories are related. If the fire is not burned out of the factory, the problem cannot be completely solved. The workers of the Shanghai Chemical Plant recently wrote 77 big-character posters and posted them to the East China Textile Management Bureau, because the serious waste of this factory is related to the substandard product quality of the textile department. On the morning of the 21st, the State-owned No. 12 Cotton Mill decided to send the head of the cadre section and several cadres to the places where the cadres were sent to solicit the opinions of the sent-down cadres on the waste and conservatism of the factory. At the same time, they are also preparing to mobilize all factory workers and their families to expose the waste phenomena in the factory or in the dormitories. The Party Committee also decided to ask the cooperative factory to put forward opinions on the quality of the cotton cloth and cotton yarn produced by their factory, in order to realize the slogan of anti-waste from both inside and outside the factory.

During the Spring Festival, the Shanghai municipal-level leading organs held continuous meetings to study the new high tide and new situation of the current rectification movement, and decided to take anti-waste and anti-conservatism as the central task of the current rectification movement; requiring leading cadres at all levels to fully understand the current new situation and the level of consciousness of the masses, resolutely overcome conservative thinking, and conscientiously improve work methods, taking a big step forward to stand in front of the masses to lead the movement, so that Shanghai's rectification movement can achieve a comprehensive new leap forward.

    上海职工全面进攻各种落后现象
    反浪费反保守为纲推动全局
    上下左右动手　方法生动活泼　斗争又深又透
    本报上海23日电　记者习平、季音报道：一个以反浪费、反保守为中心、带动全面工作的整风新高潮，已经在上海市工厂企业中开始形成。春节前后几天中，形势发展很快，越来越多的职工群众正在“反浪费、反保守、比先进、比干劲”的口号下汇成巨流，向各种落后现象展开全面进攻。
    这几天尽管是春节前后，但许多工厂的领导干部和职工依然忙碌不休，工厂里随处可见以揭发浪费、揭发保守为中心的大字报和抨击浪费、保守现象的实物展览会。记者前天晚上参观了全市最先燃起反浪费之火的国棉十七厂，这个厂的青年突击队员们正在电灯光下，忙着布置反浪费实物展览会。从工厂大门通到车间的近百公尺甬道两旁，摆着各式各样的实物。这个厂的同志对记者说，他们厂的职工劲头很大，21日早晨一上班，工人们就组织了突击队和宣传队，到车间去检查浪费情况，有的工人自动将自己浪费掉的东西搬了出来，在两个小时以内，就在全厂搜罗了大小三十五万件东西，组成了一个内容丰富、规模宏大的展览会。他兴奋地说：现在形势发展真快，群众的积极性大大超过领导的估计。记者来到了在反浪费运动中间后来居上的国棉十二厂，这里更是一片生气勃勃的景象。厂门口停满了大小车辆，宽阔走道上人群拥挤，他们是来自上海许多工厂的代表。这几天全市已有一百多个单位、一万余人先后来这里参观和交流经验。这个厂，实际上已成了全市工厂企业交流反浪费、反保守经验的中心点。
    在这次新的鸣放高潮中，上海各工厂的领导干部鼓起了革命干劲，亲自带头，深入发动和领导职工群众大鸣大放，有的还亲自帮助工人写大字报贴大字报。由于领导干部的决心大，劲头足，进一步鼓舞了广大职工的鸣放热情，形成了一个人人动手、个个揭发的对多快好省方针执行情况的群众性的大检查。有的工厂写大字报的人数比例达到百分之百，有些平时很不活动的人也积极参加了进来。从各个工厂里贴出的大字报来看，批评的矛头不仅指向经济方面，而且指向政治思想和各种落后现象。那些把反浪费反保守看作“只是为了几个钱”的人，开始转变自己的认识，更全面地理解了反浪费反保守的经济意义和政治意义，因之，自觉性和积极性都大大提高。
    上海各工厂在这次整风新高潮中，群众创造和运用了许多生动活泼的形式，使得斗争搞得又深又透。
    “对比”、“评比”的方式已为许多工厂所普遍采用，并且有了新的发展。上海烟草五厂的群众实行比思想、比方法、比效果，看谁思想先进、不保守，看谁办法多，看谁挖出潜力的经济效果大，以进一步批判保守自满思想。有些科室并创造了更多的查比方法。像计划会计科，从查账簿、查资料、查各项费用支出、查资金积压、查先进月份和落后月份的差距中、更深入地找浪费挖潜力，并且通过先查自己、后查科内、再查科外厂外的办法，不断扩大战果。这个工厂增产节约的指标，从三十八万元不断上升，最近已增加到七十万元。许多工厂还创造了办展览会的新形式，工人们把浪费的实物搬出来，放在空地上，自己写说明，自己作讲解员；随时增添扩大，不受形式的限制。这样做又快又不花钱。这种自己办、自己讲，内容丰富，形式活泼而且影响广泛的展览会，正在上海许多工厂中不断地出现。上海电表厂搞起了三个反浪费实物展览会。上海烟草五厂也搞起一个反浪费反保守展览会。展览会上的物资都是来自全厂各个科室、车间的“小仓库”。在国棉六厂里，反浪费实物展览会上的物资，连起来足足有两里多路长。
    大字报也有新的发展。不仅是工厂内部上下左右一齐写大字报鸣放，而且已开始厂与厂之间，厂与行政管理机关之间，互贴大字报，揭发浪费与保守。工厂里揭露出来的材料证明，有不少束缚生产力发展的规章制度来自上级机关，有的浪费保守和其他协作工厂有关，不把火烧出厂去，就不能彻底解决问题。上海化工厂职工最近就曾写了七十七张大字报贴到华东纺管局，因为这个厂的严重浪费同纺织部门的产品质量不合规格有关。国棉十二厂21日上午决定由该厂干部科长带领几个干部，到下放干部所在的地方，征求下放干部对厂里的浪费和保守的意见。同时，他们还准备发动全厂职工家属，对厂内或者宿舍里的浪费现象进行揭发。党委会还决定请协作厂对他们厂里生产的棉布、棉纱的质量提意见，以实现厂内厂外一起来反的口号。
    上海市级领导机关在春节期间曾连续举行会议，对当前整风运动的新高潮新形势作了研究，决定把反浪费反保守作为当前整风运动的中心任务；要求各级领导干部充分认识目前出现的新形势和群众觉悟程度，坚决克服保守思想，切实改进工作方法，大踏步地站在群众前面去领导运动，使上海的整风运动实现一个全面的新跃进。
