Don't Be a "Fault-Picker"
He Ming

In life, there are two kinds of people: those who dedicate themselves to a cause, and those who "specialize in picking faults." People engaged in revolutionary causes also need to point out shortcomings, and warmly welcome others to help them do so; but the purpose is to advance the revolutionary cause and improve future work. Therefore, they do not overlook even the smallest shortcomings, but pay more attention to the great achievements; they warmly welcome new things and enthusiastically help with the minor problems of new things. In short, whether reviewing achievements or examining shortcomings, the aim is to inspire higher revolutionary zeal, not to dampen it. "Fault-pickers" are different; their eyes are only on "faults," and they see nothing else. And because there will always be shortcomings in our work, they are never "unemployed." The result of their actions is to deflate revolutionary spirit. They also have a kind of logic: If something has shortcomings, then it shouldn't be done; if it isn't done, then there won't be such shortcomings. Turning their logic on its head, it becomes: no shortcomings – because nothing is done – passive resistance, an unforgivable mistake. From this, it seems that a few shortcomings in progress are a good thing! Of course, no one likes shortcomings.

The same thing can be viewed in different ways, leading to opposite conclusions. For example, take a certain innovation: In the eyes of a "fault-picker": Oh dear! It has so many shortcomings! How terrible, let's stop it quickly! In the eyes of a person engaged in revolutionary causes: It is an innovation, something that has never been done before, and it doesn’t have those kinds of shortcomings, so things can be greatly accomplished—thus, their enthusiasm becomes even greater. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses is aroused, and the shortcomings are eliminated in the process of doing. "Fault-pickers" come to a discouraging conclusion; once discouraged, the shortcomings in the innovation disappear – because the innovation itself disappears.

We admire and support the "Zhuge Liang" who foresees things in advance; we also need the "Zhuge Liang" who reflects on things afterward; but what we least need is the discouraging "Zhuge Liang"!

Of course, "Zhuge Liangs" who specialize in discouraging people are extremely rare, but if they are not resisted, they will have a very bad effect. And when someone is infected with the habit of "picking faults," they will become a dispiriter of the revolution, eventually exhausting their own revolutionary spirit and becoming a pessimist.

As for another kind of person engaged in a cause, they also have the character of "specializing in picking faults." Those are the bourgeois rightists. What they are engaged in is the restoration of capitalism, and they stand in a fundamentally antagonistic position to us, so they are wholeheartedly picking on the "faults" of socialism. In the socialist world, they naturally have to hide, so sometimes they also look for some real minor faults, but they put these minor faults in the rightist "factory" to inflate and distort them. Towards them, of course, there is only "beat the drums and attack them."

    不要做“专挑毛病”的人
    何明
    生活中有这么两种人：一种是干事业的人；一种是“专挑毛病”的人。干革命事业的人，也是要挑毛病的，并且十分欢迎人家也来帮着挑；但那目的是为了干革命事业，把今后的工作做得更好。因此，他们不忽视任何一个小毛病，但更看到巨大的成绩；他们对新生事物热烈欢迎，对新生事物的小毛病满怀热情地去帮助。总之，检阅成绩也好，检讨缺点也好，都是要鼓起更高的革命干劲，而不是泄气。“专挑毛病”的人则不然，他们眼睛里光有“毛病”，别的一概看不见。又因为我们的工作中总是会有缺点的，所以，他们老是失不了“业”。他们这样做的结果，就是泄革命之气。他们还有这样的一种逻辑：这件事有缺点，有缺点就不该做，不做就没有这样的缺点了。把他们的逻辑翻一个跟头就是：没有缺点——因为不做——消极怠工，不可饶恕的错误。由此看来，前进中的缺点还是有一点的好！——当然，并没有谁喜欢缺点。
    同样的事，可以有各种不同的看法，从而得出相反的结论。譬如说某一创举吧：在“专挑毛病”的人看来：啊呀！它竟有这样一些缺点呀！怎么得了，赶快停止了吧！在干革命事业的人看来：它是创举啊，从来没有过的啊，它竟然没有那样一些缺点，事情大有可为——于是，劲头就更加十足了。这样，鼓起了群众的干劲，缺点就在干的当中消灭了。“专挑毛病”的人，得出来的是泄气的结论；一泄气，创举中的缺点没有了——因为创举本身没有了。
    我们佩服和拥戴事先的“诸葛亮”；也需要事后的“诸葛亮”；千需要，万需要，就是不需要泄气的“诸葛亮”！
    当然，专门泄气的“诸葛亮”是极少的，但是，如果不对他们加以抵制，就会发生很大的坏作用。而当谁传染上“专挑毛病”的毛病的时候，就会成为革命的泄气者，以至把自己的革命之气泄尽，而成为悲观主义者。
    至于另一种干事业的人，却兼有“专挑毛病”的性格。那就是资产阶级右派。他们干的是资本主义复辟之事，和我们站在根本敌对的立场，所以是专心专意地挑社会主义的“毛病”的。在社会主义的天下里，他们当然要躲躲藏藏，所以有时候也要找一些真的小毛病，但他们却是把这些小毛病放在右派的“工厂”里加以吹胀，加以歪曲。对于他们，当然只有“鸣鼓而攻之”了。
