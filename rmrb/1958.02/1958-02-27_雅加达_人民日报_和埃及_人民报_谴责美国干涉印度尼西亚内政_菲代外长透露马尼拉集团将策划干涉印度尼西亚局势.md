Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 26th: Jakarta's "People's Daily" on the 26th demanded that the United States immediately cease its interference in Indonesia. The newspaper pointed out that U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Bickley's remarks on the 24th once again prove that interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs is indeed the policy of the U.S. government.

When speaking to reporters in Manila on the 24th, Bickley said that he very much hoped "the current Indonesian political situation can produce a stable government. Currently, Indonesia is the only chaotic region in Asia."

The "People's Daily" pointed out that the U.S. Seventh Fleet is stationed in Asia entirely to threaten Asian countries and force them to join the Manila Treaty Organization. The newspaper also said that U.S. interference has never been so blatant as it is now. The United States must immediately cease its interference in Indonesia's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 25th: Cairo's "People's Newspaper" published a commentary today condemning U.S. interference in Indonesian internal affairs. The commentary said that the U.S. imperialists "are using various pressures, terror tactics, political and economic blockades, and conspiracies launched from within to oppose nationalist rule, entirely because the Indonesian people have decided to make their sovereignty over their territory complete and to strengthen and safeguard their independence."

The newspaper pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' and the Manila Treaty Organization's conspiracies against Indonesia are bound to fail, just as the United States and its allies have failed in Egypt and Syria in the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: Manila Dispatch: According to a United Press report on the 25th, Philippine Acting Foreign Minister Serrano said that he anticipates that the Manila Treaty Organization ministerial meeting to be held in Manila from March 11th to 13th will discuss the "Indonesian question."

Sources say that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles will arrive in Manila around March 10th to attend the meeting.

According to Philippine diplomatic sources, Serrano intends to propose at this meeting a plan to link the Manila Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact Organization, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It is reported that Britain and Australia have already expressed support for Serrano's plan.

Another source said that the Netherlands, which is not a member of the Manila Treaty Organization, is also following Britain and Australia in expressing support for Serrano's plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 26th: The Indonesian National News Agency reported that Britain is strengthening its military forces in British North Borneo, which borders Indonesian Kalimantan.

According to reports, Britain has already established a batch of permanent fortifications and military outposts there. In addition, heavy weapons are being transported there every week. Recently, Britain also transferred two companies of British troops from Singapore to North Borneo.

The Indonesian National News Agency said that it appears North Borneo will soon become a military base for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    雅加达“人民日报”和埃及“人民报”
    谴责美国干涉印度尼西亚内政
    菲代外长透露马尼拉集团将策划干涉印度尼西亚局势
    新华社雅加达26日电　雅加达“人民日报”26日要求美国立即停止它对印度尼西亚的干涉。这家报纸指出，美国第七舰队司令比克利24日的谈话再次证明，干涉印度尼西亚的内政的确是美国政府的政策。
    比克利24日在马尼拉对记者发表谈话时说，他非常希望“目前的印度尼西亚政局能够产生一个稳定的政府。目前，印度尼西亚是亚洲唯一的混乱地区。”
    “人民日报”指出，美国第七舰队驻在亚洲完全是为了威胁亚洲国家，迫使它们参加马尼拉条约组织。这家报纸又说，美国的干涉从来没有像现在这样露骨过。美国必须立即停止它对印度尼西亚内政的干涉。
    新华社开罗25日电　开罗“人民报”今天发表评论谴责美国干涉印度尼西亚内政。评论说，美帝国主义者“正在使用各种压力、恐怖手段、政治和经济封锁以及从内部发动的阴谋来反对民族主义的统治，这完全是由于印度尼西亚人民决定使他们对自己领土的主权趋于完整，并且加强和维护自己的独立。”
    这家报纸指出，美帝国主义者以及马尼拉条约组织反对印度尼西亚的阴谋一定将失败，正如美国和它的盟国在中东的埃及和叙利亚遭到失败一样。
    新华社26日讯　马尼拉消息：据合众社25日报道，菲律宾代理外交部长塞兰诺说，他预料将于3月11日到13日在马尼拉举行的马尼拉条约组织部长级会议将讨论“印度尼西亚问题”。
    有消息说，美国国务卿杜勒斯将于3月10日左右到马尼拉参加这次会议。
    另据菲律宾外交人士透露，塞兰诺打算在这次会议上提出他的把马尼拉条约组织、巴格达条约组织和北大西洋公约组织联系起来的一项计划。据透露，英国和澳大利亚已经表示支持塞兰诺的计划。
    另外有消息说，不是属于马尼拉条约组织的荷兰，也追随在英国和澳大利亚之后，表示支持塞兰诺的计划。
    新华社雅加达26日电　印度尼西亚民族通讯社报道，英国正在英属北婆罗洲毗邻印度尼西亚加里曼丹的地方加强它的军事力量。
    据报道，英国在那里已经建立起一批永久性的工事和军事据点，此外，每个星期都有重型武器运到那里。最近，英国还从新加坡调了两个连的英军到北婆罗洲。
    印度尼西亚民族通讯社说，看来北婆罗洲不久会成为东南亚条约组织的军事基地。
