	Making New Products Should Also Leap Forward
	Shanxi Machinery Factory's Trial Production Tasks Greatly Exceed Previous Years

	(Our dispatch) The workers and staff of many machine manufacturing factories in Shanxi Province are overcoming all difficulties with overwhelming momentum, preparing to trial-produce a large number of new products for the country this year.

	Many factories' tasks for trial-producing new products this year greatly exceed those of previous years. Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory only had three new products last year, and only trial-produced twenty-three new products during the entire First Five-Year Plan period, but this year it will trial-produce twenty-two types; Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory will also trial-produce twenty-three types this year, Jinxi Machinery Factory will trial-produce twenty-two types, Shanxi Machine Tool Factory fifteen types, and Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory six types.

	Among these new products are many technologically complex and highly precise machines. The high-pressure compressor, the core equipment trial-produced by Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory for nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing plants, is manufactured in other countries by factories with first-class technology, and its own weight is 220 tons; because it will operate under high pressure, its parts have special requirements in terms of reliability, precision, and safety, and even the specifications of screws and nuts are very strict. The 20,000 and 50,000 cubic meter turbo blowers trial-produced by Shanxi Machine Tool Factory for nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing plants are also very precise. The electric locomotive manufactured by this machine tool factory for the metallurgical industry is a product that was originally intended to be ordered from the Soviet Union, and it is a large machine that our country has never manufactured before.

	In order to complete the task of trial-producing new products, the broad masses of workers and staff in these machinery factories have launched a surge of improving technology and mastering multiple skills. After Shanxi Machine Tool Factory undertook the heavy task of trial-producing new products, the oxyacetylene welders in the Fourth Workshop could not meet the needs, so the electric welders proposed to learn two sets of skills and master oxyacetylene welding technology. In the first half of January, two electric welders had already learned oxyacetylene welding, and it is expected that in another two or three months, all eight electric welders will be able to take on oxyacetylene welding work.

### 试制新产品也要跃进  山西机械厂试制任务大大超过往年

    试制新产品也要跃进
    山西机械厂试制任务大大超过往年
    本报讯　山西省许多机器制造工厂的职工，正以排山倒海的气势克服一切困难，准备在今年为国家试制大批新产品。
    许多工厂今年试制新产品的任务大大超过往年。太原重型机器厂去年仅有三种新产品，第一个五年计划期间也只试制新产品二十三种，今年却要试制二十二种；太原矿山机器厂今年也要试制二十三种，晋西机器厂试制二十二种，山西机床厂十五种，经纬纺织机械厂六种。
    这些新产品中有许多是技术复杂、非常精密的机器。太原重型机器厂为氮肥制造厂试制的心脏设备——高压压气机，在别的国家都是由具有第一流技术的工厂承制的，它本身重量就有二百二十吨；由于它将在高气压下运转，它的零件在可靠、精密、安全等方面都有特殊的要求，连螺钉、螺帽的规格也要求得很严格。山西机床厂为氮肥制造厂试制的二万和五万立方公尺的透平鼓风机，也非常精密。这个机床厂为冶金工业制造的电气机车，是原来要向苏联订购的产品，是我国从来没有制造过的大型机器。
    这些机械厂的广大职工为完成试制新产品的任务，掀起了改进技术、掌握多种技术的热潮。山西机床厂承担了繁重的新产品试制任务以后，四车间氧焊工不能适应需要，电焊工就提出要学会两套本领，掌握氧焊技术。在1月上中旬，就有两个电焊工学会了氧焊，预计再有两三个月，八个电焊工都将能把氧焊活承担起来。　　（顾页）
