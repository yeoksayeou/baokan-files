    President Sukarno Brings New Strength to the Indonesian People
    By the Commentator of this Newspaper

    From January 6th, President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia visited India, Egypt, Yugoslavia, Syria, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, and Japan. During his visits, President Sukarno held talks with the leaders of these countries, exchanging views on the situation in Indonesia and issues of general concern to world opinion.

    President Sukarno's overseas visit holds significant political importance. President Sukarno expressed to the people of various countries the determination of the Indonesian people to oppose colonialism and safeguard national sovereignty and independence. President Sukarno stated during his visits: "Peaceful coexistence is possible between two blocs... however, peaceful coexistence between colonialism and colonized people is impossible." The people of Asia and Africa easily understand this truth from their own experiences and understand that the Indonesian people's struggle against Dutch colonialism is an important component of the overall anti-colonial struggle of the Asian and African people. Therefore, the people of Asian and African countries wholeheartedly sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Indonesian people. During President Sukarno's visit, public opinion in Asian and African countries firmly expressed this sympathy and support. On January 15th, Egypt's "People's Daily" wrote: "When necessary, Egypt will support Indonesia in the same way that Indonesia supported Egypt's struggle to recover the Suez Canal. Egyptian volunteers will fight alongside their Indonesian brothers."

    Since the Indonesian government and people have taken resolute measures to strengthen the struggle to recover West Irian, imperialist countries have frantically launched a conspiracy to slander and antagonize Indonesia, attempting to lower Indonesia's international standing and politically isolate it. However, the imperialist conspiracy has failed. Through President Sukarno's visits to various countries, many countries' governments and people have gained a better understanding of Indonesia's adherence to the struggle to recover West Irian, and have provided extensive support. The influence of the Indonesian people's anti-colonial struggle has also been further expanded.

    During President Sukarno's absence, a small group of rebels instigated by imperialism intensified their activities in the Central Sumatra region, even declaring the establishment of a so-called "alternative government." They vainly attempted to sabotage from within the Indonesian people's just struggle to liberate West Irian and to break free from imperialist control economically. However, these rebellious elements' criminal activities of colluding with imperialism will surely incite all patriotic and democratic forces in Indonesia to unite more closely and resolutely defend the independence and unity of the motherland. Mass organizations such as the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union, the People's Youth League, the Indonesian Women's Movement Association, the Indonesian Peasants' Front, and seventeen Sumatran people's organizations in Jakarta have all issued statements supporting the government's decision to arrest the rebel elements. The National Front for the Liberation of West Irian, composed of Indonesian soldiers, workers, peasants, youth, and women, was officially established, calling on the people to strengthen national unity, suppress subversive activities, and eliminate disruptive groups to defend the unity of the Republic of Indonesia. Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, also called on the people to help the government overcome the current difficulties and defeat the rebels in Central Sumatra. Aidit said that as long as the government consistently adopts a resolute attitude, and as long as the people and the army strengthen their unity, the rebels' conspiracy will not succeed.

    During this visit, President Sukarno also paid special attention to strengthening world peace and related issues of developing relations between countries. In the joint communiques with the leaders of India, Egypt, Syria, and Yugoslavia, President Sukarno expressed support for arranging an international conference to end the Cold War, advocated a halt to the arms race, a ban on the testing and use of nuclear weapons, and reiterated Indonesia's policy of non-alignment in military blocs, advocating that all countries must develop relations with each other on the basis of peaceful coexistence. He also emphasized adherence to the principles of the Bandung Conference and maintaining the Charter of the United Nations. These undoubtedly have a positive significance for promoting the development of world peace.

    President Sukarno's overseas visit is conducive to enhancing Indonesia's international standing, further strengthening friendly relations between Indonesia and the people of Asian and African countries, and will bring new encouragement to the Indonesian people's struggle. As President Sukarno said before leaving Japan to return home: "Our revolution is a great process, sometimes it rises and sometimes it falls. However, we are confident that our revolution will succeed." The 84 million people of Indonesia will unite more closely around President Sukarno, overcome all difficulties, hold high the banner against imperialism, and strive to build a completely independent, prosperous, and happy Indonesia.

    苏加诺总统为印度尼西亚人民带来了新的力量
    本报评论员
    印度尼西亚共和国苏加诺总统从1月6日开始，先后访问了印度、埃及、南斯拉夫、叙利亚、巴基斯坦、锡兰、缅甸、泰国和日本等九个国家。在访问期间，苏加诺总统同这些国家政府的领导人举行了会谈，就印度尼西亚的局势，以及世界舆论所普遍关心的问题广泛地交换了意见。
    苏加诺总统这次的出国访问，具有重大的政治意义。苏加诺总统向各国人民表达了印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义和维护国家主权与民族独立的决心。苏加诺总统在访问期间说：“两个集团之间是可以和平共处的……，但是，殖民主义和殖民地人民之间是不可能有和平共处的。”亚非人民从切身的经验中，是很容易理解这个道理的，并且懂得印度尼西亚人民反对荷兰殖民主义的斗争，是亚非人民整个反殖民主义斗争的一个重要组成部分。因此，亚非各国人民衷心地同情和支持印度尼西亚人民的正义斗争。在苏加诺总统访问期间，亚非各国舆论都坚定地表示了这种同情和支持。1月15日埃及“人民报”就写道：“必要的时候，埃及将像印度尼西亚支持埃及收复苏伊士运河斗争那样，支持印度尼西亚。埃及的志愿军将同自己的印度尼西亚兄弟们并肩作战。”
    自从印度尼西亚政府和人民采取坚决的措施，加强了收复西伊里安的斗争以来，帝国主义国家便猖狂地发起了一个污蔑和敌视印度尼西亚的阴谋活动。企图降低印度尼西亚的国际地位，在政治上孤立印度尼西亚。但是，帝国主义的阴谋失败了。经过苏加诺总统到各国的访问，许多国家政府和人民对印度尼西亚坚持收复西伊里安的斗争有了更多的理解，给予广泛的支持。印度尼西亚人民反殖民主义斗争的影响也更加扩大了。
    在苏加诺总统出国期间，受帝国主义策动的一小撮反叛分子在中苏门答腊地区加紧活动，甚至宣布成立什么“另一个政府”，他们妄想从内部破坏印度尼西亚人民解放西伊里安、争取从经济上摆脱帝国主义的控制的正义斗争。但是，这些叛乱分子勾结帝国主义的罪恶活动，必将激起印度尼西亚一切爱国民主力量更加紧密地团结起来，坚决捍卫祖国的独立和统一。全印度尼西亚中央职工会、人民青年团、印度尼西亚妇女运动协会、印度尼西亚农民阵线以及在雅加达的十七个苏门答腊人民团体等群众团体都先后发表声明，支持政府通缉叛逆分子的决定。由印度尼西亚军人、工人、农民、青年和妇女组成的争取解放西伊里安民族阵线正式成立，号召人民加强民族团结，镇压颠覆活动和铲除捣乱集团，保卫印度尼西亚共和国的统一。印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地更号召人民帮助政府克服目前困难，打倒中苏门答腊的叛乱分子。艾地说，只要政府始终一贯地采取坚决的态度，只要人民和军队加强团结，叛乱分子的阴谋就不会得逞。
    苏加诺总统在这次访问中，还特别注意到加强世界和平及有关发展各国之间的关系的问题。苏加诺总统在同印度、埃及、叙利亚、南斯拉夫政府领导人的会谈公报中，都曾表示拥护安排一次结束冷战的国际会议，主张停止军备竞赛，禁止试验和使用核武器，并重申了印度尼西亚不参加军事集团的政策，主张各国必须在和平共处的基础上发展彼此之间的关系，同时强调了忠实于万隆会议的原则及维护联合国的宪章等主张。这些无疑对促进世界和平的发展是有积极意义的。
    苏加诺总统的这次出国访问，有利于印度尼西亚国际地位的提高，有利于继续加强印度尼西亚同亚非各国人民之间的友好关系，并会给印度尼西亚人民的斗争带来了新的鼓舞力量。正像苏加诺总统在离日返国前所说的：“我们的革命是一个巨大的进程，它时而高涨，时而低落。但是，我们确信我们的革命一定会成功。”印度尼西亚八千四百万人民，将会更加紧密地团结在苏加诺总统的周围，克服一切困难，高举反对帝国主义的大旗，为建立一个完全独立和繁荣幸福的印度尼西亚而斗争。
