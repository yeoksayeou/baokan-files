Since liberation, the majority of literary and art workers across the country have resolutely implemented the policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, resulting in great development in the arts. Some troupes have traveled for years through deep mountains and remote valleys to perform for farmers, deeply welcomed by the broad masses of peasants. The Longquan Yue Opera Troupe in Zhejiang Province has persisted in performing in mountainous areas for eight years. Their footprints have almost covered the deep mountains and canyons of Longquan, Taishun, and other counties, allowing farmers in high mountain areas, where "drums and gongs have not been heard for a thousand years, and operas have not been seen for ten thousand years," to also see operas. This troupe is deeply loved by farmers in mountainous areas. The Jianchang County Ping Opera Troupe in Liaoning Province actively performs for workers and peasants, year after year. They walk, cross rivers, climb mountains, and carry luggage, regardless of wind or snow, overcoming countless difficulties. They participate in agricultural labor while performing, promoting a hardworking and simple work style. However, there are not many troupes in the country that consistently go to the countryside and mountains, delve into factories and mines, and army units to perform for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, living, eating, and working alongside them. More art performance groups perform in cities for a long time, rarely or never going to rural mountainous areas, factories, mines, or army units to perform for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. A minority of art performance groups have long been detached from reality and the masses, fostering a bourgeois style of extravagance, emphasizing lavishness and ostentation, thereby affecting and hindering the implementation of the policy of art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The great rectification movement has greatly enhanced the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of literary and art workers; many art performance groups have proposed to resolutely overcome bourgeois ideology and work styles, and implement the policy of running undertakings diligently and thriftily and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Recently, the cultural and artistic departments have ignited a raging fire against bureaucracy, extravagance, stagnation, and squeamishness. It can be seen that literary and art workers are catching up at a rapid pace, and they will bring about a great leap forward in cultural and artistic undertakings. Around the Spring Festival this year, many art performance groups across the country are traveling light, going deep into old revolutionary areas and mountainous areas, factories, mines, and army units, delivering art to the doorsteps of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. A dozen art performance groups in Beijing will perform in the old revolutionary base area – the Taihang Mountains, in Fuping, Zuoquan, and other places during the Spring Festival. The actors are enthusiastically rehearsing many programs loved by farmers. Many theater troupes and film projection teams in Shaanxi are going to the most remote mountainous areas to perform for farmers who have not seen an opera in more than twenty years. All of this is enough to show that this year's Spring Festival is a good start to the great leap forward in the arts. The broad masses of literary and art workers, like the people of the whole country, are giving full play to their socialist revolutionary drive, continuously improving the quality of art, and marching towards the vast plains and remote mountainous areas, towards factories, mines, and the frontier coastal defense. They will sweep away bureaucracy, extravagance, stagnation, and squeamishness, and bring about a great leap forward in the arts.

    艺术表演送上门
    江浩
    解放以来，全国大多数文艺工作者坚决执行了为工农兵服务的方针，使艺术事业得到很大的发展。有些剧团经年累月跋涉在深山远沟为农民演出，深受广大农民的欢迎。浙江省龙泉县劳动越剧团八年来一直坚持在山区演出，他们的足迹几乎踏遍了龙泉、泰顺等县的深山峡谷，使“千年不闻锣鼓响，万年不见戏上台”的高山地区的农民也看到了戏，这个剧团受到山区农民的热爱。辽宁省建昌县评剧团积极为工农演出，数年如一日，他们走路、过河、爬山、背行李，不问风里雪里，克服了无数困难，他们边演出边参加农业劳动，发扬了艰苦朴素的工作作风。然而，这种长期坚持下乡上山，深入厂矿、连队、为工农兵演出，同工农兵同吃同住同劳动的剧团在全国是不多的。更多的艺术表演团体则长期在城市演出，没有或者很少去农村山区，下工矿、连队，为广大工人农民和士兵演出。少数的艺术表演团体已长期脱离实际，脱离群众，滋长了铺张浪费、讲阔气、讲排场的资产阶级作风，从而影响和妨碍了艺术为工农兵服务的方针的贯彻。
    伟大的整风运动使广大文艺工作者的社会主义觉悟大大提高；许多艺术表演团体提出坚决克服资产阶级思想作风，贯彻勤俭办事业、为工农兵服务的方针。最近文化艺术部门更燃起了反对官气、阔气、暮气、娇气的熊熊之火。可以看到，文艺工作者正以急速的步伐赶上前去，他们将使文化艺术事业也来一个大跃进。今年春节前后，全国许多艺术表演团体轻装简行，深入老区山区，下工矿、连队，把艺术送到工农兵的门上。北京十几个艺术表演团体在春节要到老革命根据地——太行山区的阜平、左权等地演出，演员们热情地赶排了许多农民喜爱的节目。陕西许多剧团和电影放映队要去最偏僻的山区，为二十多年没有看过戏的农民演出。这一切都足以说明，今年的春节是艺术事业大跃进的良好开端。广大文艺工作者同全国人民一样，鼓足社会主义革命干劲，不断地提高艺术质量，向广大平原农村和偏僻山区，向工矿和边疆海防进军。他们将使官气、阔气、暮气、娇气一扫而空，使艺术事业大跃进。
