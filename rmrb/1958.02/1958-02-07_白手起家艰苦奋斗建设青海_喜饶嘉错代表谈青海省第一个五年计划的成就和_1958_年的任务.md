I fully agree with all the reports of the Congress and express my firm determination to implement them. From the report on the implementation of the 1957 national budget and the draft 1958 national budget, and the report on the draft 1958 national economic plan, we specifically see the development of our country's various construction undertakings, which demonstrates as hard fact that the lives of the people across the country have improved. At the same time, we also fully realize that the majority of our country's expenditures are used for construction, and the proportion of defense spending is very small. This demonstrates as hard fact that our country loves peace, and once again solemnly declares to the world that the socialist system has incomparable superiority over imperialism, which disregards the life and death of the people and spends the majority of the national budget on expanding armaments and preparing for war. From the perspective of ethnic minorities in the report on language reform, the problem of the difficulty in learning Chinese is solved, and a common foundation for creating and reforming characters is found. We will see the prospect of the languages of nearly fifty ethnic groups in the motherland developing from different to the same direction, which will promote the great unity of the multi-ethnic motherland. In studying these reports, we once again specifically experienced the correctness of the Communist Party's leadership and the superiority of the socialist system, thus further recognizing the crimes of the bourgeois right-wingers in opposing the Party, the people, and socialism. We resolutely follow the Communist Party and march towards the bright road of socialism.

Now, I would like to take this opportunity to report to the Congress on the achievements of Qinghai Province in the first five-year plan and several major tasks for 1958, and respectfully request your corrections.

**The Successful Completion of the First Five-Year Plan Has Brought Profound Changes to Qinghai**

Qinghai's first five-year plan for developing the national economy, under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, following the general task of the country during the transition period and the general task in terms of ethnic issues, and through the hard work of the people of all ethnic groups in the province, has been successfully completed. The targets set by the province's five-year plan, with the exception of individual ones, are expected to be completed and greatly overfulfilled, which has brought tremendous and profound changes to the social face of our province. At the beginning of Qinghai's liberation, the reactionary ruling class left us a mess of shrinking production, sluggish markets, and extreme poverty caused by decades of cruel oppression and exploitation by a group of man-eating beasts. When the first five-year plan began, although Qinghai's national economy had completed its recovery, it was still very backward. At that time, industry had no foundation, the level of production was extremely low, the small-scale peasant economy was like a vast ocean, and the capitalist economy occupied a large advantage in the field of commodity circulation. Due to the completion of the first five-year plan, we have victoriously established the dominant position of socialism in the vast majority of sectors of the national economy, industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production has greatly developed, the market is thriving, and the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of all ethnic groups have been significantly improved.

**The Victory of Socialist Transformation and the Anti-Rightist Struggle Will Guarantee the Smooth Progress of Future Construction Undertakings**

The great achievements of our province's first five-year plan are first reflected in the great victory of the socialist revolution. Our province had basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce in the agricultural areas in terms of the ownership of the means of production by 1956. Now 99 percent of farmers in the agricultural areas have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, 75 percent of handicraftsmen have joined handicraft producers' cooperatives, 93 percent of private industrial households have implemented joint state-private ownership, and 88 percent of commercial households have implemented joint state-private ownership, formed cooperative stores, and been transformed into state-owned or cooperative commerce. The landlord class in the agricultural areas has long been eliminated, the urban and rural bourgeoisie has also been eliminated, small producers have basically completed cooperation, and the broad masses of peasants and other working people have been freed forever from the road of poverty, which has opened up broad prospects for the development of productive forces. The cooperative movement in the pastoral areas and small agricultural areas has also developed rapidly. At the same time, 45 pastoral production cooperatives and one state-owned farm were established on a trial basis in the pastoral areas, creating a good start for the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. Because of our victory in the three major socialist transformations, we have destroyed the old economic base and established a new economic base, thereby forming a new ethnic unity. Now the ethnic relations in the agricultural areas are new relations based on the socialist economic base, and the ethnic relations in the pastoral areas will also be pushed to a new stage due to the gradual progress of socialist transformation. It should be recognized that such a great, earth-shaking socialist transformation movement was able to proceed smoothly and achieve great victory in our province, a multi-ethnic region with complex circumstances, because of the correct implementation of the Party Central Committee's guidelines, policies, and instructions on carrying out socialist transformation in ethnic minority areas, and because of our correct implementation of the Party's ethnic policies.

In the summer of 1957, our province, like the people across the country, launched a mass rectification movement and an anti-rightist struggle. This was a socialist great revolution of the two-road struggle on the political and ideological fronts. Because we thoroughly smashed the frantic attacks of the bourgeois right-wingers against the Party, the people, and socialism in this struggle, greatly raised the consciousness of the people, thereby consolidating the achievements we have made in socialist transformation, and will guarantee the smoother progress of socialist construction undertakings in the future.

**Major Achievements in Various Construction Projects, Ethnic Groups Are Becoming Increasingly Closely United**

Secondly, it is reflected in the tremendous victories achieved in socialist construction. Looking at our basic construction investment: the total investment in basic construction in five years was 588.84 million yuan. A total of 21 construction units above the quota limit started construction, and it is expected that 11 can be completed by the end of 1957; a total of 782 construction units below the quota limit, most of which can be completed by the end of 1957. Now Qinghai Province's industry is far from comparable to the so-called "Eight Major Factories" left by Ma Bufang. In particular, the pastoral areas, which had no industry at all in the past, have now begun to have modern industry. The total investment in basic construction in agriculture, animal husbandry, water conservancy, and meteorology in five years was 66.8 million yuan, exceeding 1.5 times the amount stipulated in the five-year plan. In water conservancy alone, the state invested in the construction of large and medium-sized canals in five years, plus the canals built by the people with government assistance and those built by the masses themselves, which expanded the irrigated area by 800,000 mu. In five years, 4,900 kilometers of new roads were built, and the mileage of open roads reached 7,982 kilometers, an increase of 4.9 times compared with 1952 and equivalent to 17 times the mileage before liberation. The completion of these basic construction projects has greatly promoted the development of production.

Looking at the development speed of various production undertakings in the province: the total output value of local industry exceeded the target stipulated in the five-year plan by 81 percent, an increase of nearly 10 times in 1957 compared with 1952, and 52 times compared with 1949. The output of major products, such as: electricity generation increased 11 times in 1957 compared with 1952, and 20 times compared with 1949; coal increased 3.7 times in 1957 compared with 1952, and 9.5 times compared with 1949. The output value of handicraft production increased 30 percent in 1957 compared with 1952, an average annual increase of 5.4 percent. The turnover of passengers and goods in local transportation industry exceeded the target stipulated in the five-year plan by 39 percent, an increase of 38 times in 1957 compared with 1952. The total grain output in agricultural production, although affected by natural disasters, is expected to complete 99 percent, an increase of 72.4 percent in 1957 compared with 1952, an average annual increase of 11.5 percent, and nearly 1.2 times compared with 1949. The yield per mu of grain crops reached 222.5 jin, an increase of 47 percent in 1957 compared with 1952. The total output of rapeseed increased 81.3 percent in 1957 compared with 1952, an average annual increase of 12.6 percent. The number of various livestock in animal husbandry is expected to reach more than 17.17 million head in 1957, accounting for 87 percent of the target stipulated in the five-year plan, an increase of 77 percent compared with 1952, an average annual increase of 12.1 percent, and 38.7 percent higher than the highest livestock quantity in history in 1937.

Looking at the fruitful results obtained from resource exploration work: we now have a preliminary understanding of the tectonic structure, stratigraphy, lithology, lithofacies, and mineral distribution of the Qaidam area. Through exploration, we have not only discovered the nationally famous petroleum, stone blocks, and placer gold, but also discovered coal, iron, aluminum, zinc, chromium, copper, molybdenum, nickel, crystal, gypsum, etc., and it has been proven that many of these mineral deposits have industrial mining value. Exploration has proven that the Qaidam Basin is not only China's most promising petroleum industrial base, but also a chemical and non-ferrous metal industrial base. Exploration has also proven that the Qilian Mountains in our province are rich in ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, and non-metallic mineral deposits. Some exploration work has also been carried out in other areas. In the process of exploration, we received enthusiastic support from the local Mongolian, Tibetan, Kazakh, Hui, and other ethnic groups, ensuring the smooth progress of the exploration work, fully demonstrating the close unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our province in the socialist construction undertaking.

Looking at the tremendous development in cultural, educational, and health undertakings: in five years, eight new secondary vocational schools, four secondary normal schools, ten ordinary middle schools, and 415 primary schools have been built. The two higher education institutions in Qinghai's history did not exist before and now these have been added. The number of students enrolled in 1957 increased seven times compared with 1952, secondary normal schools increased one time compared with 1952, ordinary middle schools increased 6.8 times compared with 1952, primary schools increased 92 percent; the number of hospital beds reached 1,610 in 1957, an increase of nearly 2.7 times compared with 1952, and 16 times compared with 1949, the number of medical and epidemic prevention institutions reached 147 in 1957, an increase of 1.8 times compared with 1952, and 15.3 times compared with 1949; before liberation there were no film projection teams, and in 1957, there were 111 teams, an increase of 7.5 times compared with 1952; the broadcasting power increased more than 10 times in 1957 compared with 1952, and 12 new wired broadcasting stations were built.

The development of cultural, educational, and health undertakings for ethnic minorities is even more rapid. In terms of culture and education, one ethnic college, seven ethnic normal schools, and the number of ethnic primary schools has increased from 187 in 1952 to 487. The number of students enrolled in 1957, the number of ethnic minority students in ethnic colleges and secondary schools reached 2,847, an increase of 12.6 times compared with 1952. The number of students in ethnic primary schools reached 4,800, an increase of nearly 1.5 times compared with 1952. In terms of health, since liberation, 32 people's hospitals and 5 venereal disease and plague prevention stations have been established in pastoral areas, with 742 beds. In addition, in order to meet the cultural needs of ethnic minority people, ethnic song and dance troupes and cultural service teams have been established successively, a Tibetan newspaper has been founded, and 73 kinds of ethnic minority language books have been published. Due to the development of ethnic cultural, educational, and health work, the Party's concern for ethnic minorities has been further embodied among the ethnic minority people in our province, thus greatly enhancing the patriotic thought of ethnic minorities.

**Strive to Achieve a Great Leap Forward in Production in 1958 and Lead the Masses in Large-Scale Production on the Basis of Ethnic Unity**

The achievements of the first five-year plan are tremendous. Our province's task in 1958 is an extremely realistic goal formulated based on the achievements of the first five-year plan, the current situation, and the needs for future development. 1958 is the first year we victoriously enter the second five-year plan on the basis of the successful completion of the first five-year plan, which is a very important year. At this time, under the conditions that we have achieved great victories in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government in our province, we will resolutely rely on the masses, organize and lead the masses to carry out large-scale production on the basis of more united ethnic relations. At the same time, we will constantly overcome right-leaning thoughts and realistically improve the indicators of the plan. Now, I will only put forward the following main aspects regarding the tasks for 1958.

First, regarding agriculture, water conservancy, forestry, and animal husbandry: In 1958, agricultural production should focus on increasing the yield per unit area, and actively reclaim wasteland, expand the cultivated area, greatly increase grain production, and appropriately develop oil crops and other technical crops. It is planned to reclaim 163,000 mu of wasteland. The grain production increase plan is to increase production by 280 million jin on the basis of 1.28 billion jin in 1957, accounting for 21.87 percent of the original output. The planting area of oil crops is 612,000 mu, and the total output will reach 63.3264 million jin. In order to ensure the realization of the grain production increase task, we must: (1) Vigorously build farmland water conservancy, and this year's planned water conservancy project will reach 1,014,485 mu. At present, the province has completed 200,000 mu of water conservancy projects; (2) Massively accumulate and produce fertilizer. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu this year should increase by 25 to 30 percent compared with 1957; (3) Strengthen the research and testing of soil improvement. The work of washing alkali in the Qaidam area should also be actively carried out; (4) Actively breed and promote excellent varieties suitable for local conditions, educate farmers to cultivate intensively, change work methods, and strengthen field management; (5) Plan the mountainous areas in a planned way, give full play to the potential of the mountainous areas, develop diversified operations in accordance with local conditions, and vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work.

In terms of forestry: In accordance with the principle of "masses as the main body and state-owned as auxiliary," we will vigorously carry out afforestation, seedling cultivation, and seed collection work. It is planned to afforest 170,000 mu, cultivate seedlings 13,000 mu, and collect seeds 460,000 mu.

Animal husbandry and agriculture have interdependent relations and are the main economy on which the broad masses of herdsmen in our province rely for survival and development. Vigorously developing animal husbandry is one of the main links in implementing the policy of ethnic equality and unity in our province. In 1958, the pastoral areas of our province should continue to strengthen the united front work on the basis of strengthening ethnic unity, consolidate social order, implement the established policies of the Party and the state, and follow the principle of "developing animal husbandry on the basis of actively and steadily carrying out socialist transformation, gradually changing nomadic grazing to settled grazing, implementing the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry (firstly feed production), and concurrently operating livestock product processing industries and other sideline production, and developing a diversified economy centered on animal husbandry." Broadly and deeply carry out mass work with the main content of vigorously developing animal husbandry, and set off a climax of animal husbandry production. The planned total number of livestock in the province is 18,552,000 (heads/horses), an increase of 8 percent compared with the estimated number in 1957.

Regarding industrial production: It is planned that the total industrial output value in 1958 will increase by 5.69 percent compared with the estimated number in 1957; the output of most of the 34 industrial products controlled by the state and the province are increasing. In order to partially solve the needs of the state and the province for some raw materials and mineral products, in 1958, metal and non-metal mines should be actively mined by indigenous methods with conditions. The planned mining of gold, native iron, crystal ore, chromite ore, and lead-zinc ore has been initially included in the plan. In terms of basic construction: In 1958, the total investment in the province will increase compared with 1957, and among them, the investment in local industry, transportation, and power undertakings accounts for about 54 percent. Through the newly added main production capacity from state investment, it is estimated that in 1958, it would be: a power equipment capacity of 3,000 kilowatts; the annual mining capacity of coal is 150,000 tons, leather making 100,000 sheets, paper making 300 tons, the newly added mileage of roads is 150 kilometers; 165 heavy-duty trucks, and 35 passenger cars.

It is a favorable condition for our province to complete the above-mentioned main production tasks. Now, let's just talk about the conditions for realizing the great leap forward in agricultural production: (1) Through the great socialist debate in rural areas, the destructive activities of illegal landlords, rich peasants, and other bad elements have been effectively cracked down, capitalist ideology has been criticized, and the determination of farmers of all ethnic groups to take the socialist road has been strengthened; (2) Through the study of the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) and the emergence of some high-yield and high-yield examples of farms and societies, right-leaning ideology has been further criticized, the direction has been clarified, confidence has been boosted, and the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses for production has been unprecedentedly high; (3) After rectification and reform, the cooperatives have made great strides in consolidation and improvement, and a large number of cadres have been enriched at the grassroots level and sent down to production, which has greatly strengthened the agricultural production front; (4) The winter production upsurge centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation has prepared a good material basis for the great leap forward in agriculture.

At present, under the conditions of promoting the upsurge of socialist production in our province, the Provincial Party Committee has decided: First of all, starting from the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, it is estimated that it will take 40 days to vigorously carry out rectification and reform by adopting the methods of great airing of views, great contending, great debates, and big-character posters. I think that this correct and firm measure of the Provincial Party Committee is of decisive significance for further strengthening the Party's collective leadership, more correctly implementing the Central Committee's guidelines, policies, and instructions, and better leading the masses to do everything possible to strive to achieve the great leap forward in production in 1958. Through this rectification and reform, it will certainly more powerfully promote the victorious advance of the socialist construction undertaking.

Now, the glorious task before us is to strive to complete and overfulfill the tasks of 1958 on the basis of the first five-year plan, which is an important key to entering the second five-year plan. However, at present, our province is still very backward compared with other parts of the country, and we will inevitably encounter many difficulties on the long road of future construction. In the past, our province relied mostly on state allocations for construction funds due to its weak economic base. Under the circumstances that the country's financial and material resources are not very abundant today, our province's construction undertaking will naturally be subject to some restrictions. In the future, in addition to the strong support from the state, we must rely more on our own hard work. We must not only have the confidence to build Qinghai well, but also have the determination to work hard and start from scratch. With confidence and determination, we will have ample revolutionary enthusiasm. This enthusiasm will certainly guarantee that we can thoroughly implement the national policy of "building the country through diligence and frugality" and successfully complete our province's arduous tasks in 1958.

Our province has a vast territory and sparse population, and not only agriculture and animal husbandry have great potential power, but also abundant metal and non-metal mineral deposits are buried in industry. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, relying on the broad masses of the people, and with the strong support of the people across the country, we will definitely be able to build Qinghai into an important industrial base of the motherland, and vigorously develop agriculture and animal husbandry, so that it can play its due role in the motherland's socialist construction undertaking. This bright and great prospect greatly encourages the people of all ethnic groups in our province to unite with the people across the country, with unparalleled heroic revolutionary spirit and high-spirited will to strive for 15 years, to respond to and realize the Party's great call to "catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in 15 years or a little longer." Let the Oriental dragon, composed of 600 million people, ride the wind and waves forward, and forward again.

　　白手起家艰苦奋斗建设青海
    喜饶嘉错代表谈青海省第一个五年计划的成就和1958年的任务
    我完全同意大会的各项报告并表示坚决贯彻执行。从关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告、关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告中，我们具体地看到了我国各项建设事业的发展，这铁一般地说明了全国人民的生活是提高了。同时我们还充分地认识到我们的国家的大部分支出是使用在建设事业上的，国防费占的比重是很小的，这铁一般地说明了我国是酷爱和平的，也就是社会主义阵营再一次向世界庄严地宣布，社会主义制度比起不顾人民死活而把国家预算大部分用在扩军备战的帝国主义有不可比拟的优越性。在文字改革报告中，从少数民族角度上看，解决了汉语文难学的问题，找到了创造和改革文字的共同基础。我们将看到祖国近五十个民族的语文，由不同向同的方向发展的前景，它将促进多民族的祖国大家庭的大团结。我们在学习这些报告中，又一次具体地体会了共产党领导的正确和体会了社会主义制度的优越性，因而更加认清了资产阶级右派分子反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶。我们坚决跟着共产党走，向社会主义的光明大道走。
    现在我愿借这个机会将青海省在第一个五年计划的成就和一九五八年的几项主要任务向大会汇报，敬请指正。
    第一个五年计划的胜利完成  使青海面貌发生了深刻变化
    青海发展国民经济第一个五年计划，在党和人民政府的正确领导下，遵循着国家在过渡时期的总任务和在民族问题方面的总任务，经过全省各族人民的辛勤劳动，已经胜利地完成。本省五年计划所规定的指标，除个别的以外，预计都能够完成和大大地超额完成，这就使我省社会面貌发生了巨大而深刻的变化。青海在解放之初，反动统治阶级给我们遗留下来的，是他们一群吃人野兽几十年残酷地压迫、剥削所造成的生产萎缩、市场萧条、人民生活极端贫困的烂摊子。当第一个五年计划开始时，青海的国民经济，虽然完成了恢复工作，但仍然是非常落后的。当时，工业毫无基础，生产水平极低，小农经济像一片汪洋大海，资本主义经济在商品流通领域中占着很大的优势。由于第一个五年计划的完成，使我们胜利地确立了社会主义在国民经济绝大多数部门中的统治地位，工、农、牧业生产大大地发展了一步，市场欣欣向荣，各族广大人民的物质和文化生活得到了显著的提高和改善。
    社会主义改造和反右斗争的胜利将保证今后建设事业的顺利进展
    我省第一个五年计划的伟大成就，首先表现在社会主义革命得到了伟大的胜利。我省在一九五六年就已经基本上完成了农业区的农业、手工业和私营工商业在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造。现在农业区已经有百分之九十九的农户加入了农业生产合作社。百分之七十五的手工业者加入了手工业生产合作社，百分之九十三的私营工业户，实行了公私合营，百分之八十八的商业户，实行了公私合营，组成了合作商店，转为国营或合作社商业。农业区的地主阶级早已被消灭了，城乡的资产阶级也已经被消灭了，小生产者已基本上完成了合作化，广大农民和其他劳动人民已经永远摆脱了贫困的道路，这就为生产力的发展开辟了广阔的前途。牧业区的小块农业区的合作化运动也有了较快的发展。同时还在牧业区试办了四十五个牧业生产合作社和一个国营牧场，为逐步实现畜牧业的社会主义改造创造了良好的开端。由于我们在社会主义三大改造上的胜利，摧毁了旧的经济基础，建立了新的经济基础，从而形成了新的民族团结。现在农业区的民族关系，已经是建立在社会主义经济基础上的新关系，牧业区的民族关系也将由于社会主义改造的逐步进行而被推向一个新的阶段。应该认识：这样一个伟大的、翻天复地的社会主义改造运动，在我省这样一个情况复杂的多民族地区，所以能够顺利进行，并且取得伟大的胜利，是由于正确贯彻执行了党中央关于在少数民族地区进行社会主义改造的方针、政策和指示，是由于我们正确执行了党的民族政策。
    一九五七年夏天，我省和全国人民一样开展了一个全民性的整风运动和反右派斗争。这是一场政治战线上和思想战线上的两条道路斗争的社会主义大革命。由于我们在这场斗争中彻底粉碎了资产阶级右派分子向党、向人民、向社会主义的猖狂进攻，大大提高了人民群众的觉悟，从而巩固了我们在社会主义改造上所取得的成果，并且将保证今后社会主义建设事业更加顺利进展。
    各项建设取得巨大成就  各族人民日益亲密团结
    其次表现在社会主义建设方面取得了巨大的胜利。我们从基本建设投资来看：五年内基本建设投资总额五亿八千八百八十四万元。开始施工的限额以上的建设单位共二十一个，预计在一九五七年底可以全部建成的有十一个；限额以下的建设单位共七百八十二个，其中大部分可以在一九五七年底建成。现在青海省的工业已经是远非马步芳遗留下来的所谓“八大工厂”所可比拟，特别是过去根本没有工业的牧业区，现在已经开始有了现代化工业。五年内对农业、牧业、水利、气象的基本建设投资总共六千六百八十万元，超过五年计划所规定的一点五倍，仅水利一项，五年内由国家投资建设的大中型渠道，加上民办公助和群众自办的渠道，共扩大了灌溉面积八十万亩。五年内新建公路四千九百公里，通车里程已达到七千九百八十二公里，比一九五二年增加了四点九倍，相当于解放前的十七倍。这些基本建设的完成，大大地促进了生产的发展。
    从全省各项生产事业的发展速度来看：地方工业总产值超过五年计划规定指标的百分之八十一，一九五七年比一九五二年增长了将近十倍，比一九四九年增长了五十二倍。主要产品量，如：发电量一九五七年比一九五二年增长了十一倍，比一九四九年增长了二十倍；煤一九五七年比一九五二年增长了三点七倍，比一九四九年增长了九点五倍。手工业生产产值一九五七年比一九五二年增长了百分之三十，平均每年增长百分之五点四。地方运输业的客货周转量超过五年计划规定的百分之三十九，一九五七年比一九五二年增长了三十八倍。农业生产方面的粮食总产量，虽然由于自然灾害的影响，预计能完成百分之九十九，一九五七年比一九五二年增长了百分之七十二点四，平均每年增长百分之十一点五，比一九四九年增长将近一点二倍。粮食作物每亩产量达到二百二十斤半，一九五七年比一九五二年提高了百分之四十七。油菜子的总产量，一九五七年比一九五二年增长百分之八十一点三，平均每年增长百分之十二点六。畜牧业方面的各种牲畜头数，一九五七年预计达到一千七百一十七万多头，为五年计划所规定的百分之八十七，比一九五二年增长了百分之七十七，平均每年增长百分之十二点一，比历史上牲畜量最高的一九三七年还高百分之三十八点七。
    从资源勘探工作获得的丰硕成果来看：现在对柴达木地区的大地构造、地层、岩性、岩相及矿产分布情况，基本上有了初步了解。经过勘探，不仅发现了全国闻名的石油、石块和沙金，还发现煤、铁、铝、锌、铬、铜、钼、镍、水晶、石膏等，并且已经证明了其中有许多矿藏具有工业开采价值。勘探证明：柴达木盆地不仅是我国最有希望的石油工业基地，而且是化学和有色金属工业基地。勘探还证明了我省祁连山地区蕴藏着大量的黑色金属、有色金属和非金属矿藏。在其他地区也进行了一些勘探工作。在进行勘探工作中，得到了当地蒙、藏、哈、回等各族人民的热诚支援，保证了勘探工作的顺利进行，充分表现了我省各族人民在社会主义建设事业上的亲密团结。
    从文教卫生事业上的巨大发展来看：五年内新建中等专业学校八所、中等师范四所、普通中学十所、小学四百一十五所，青海历史上没有过的高等学校现在已有二所。一九五七年在校学生数比一九五二年增长了七倍，中等师范学校比一九五二年增加了一倍，普通中学比一九五二年增加六点八倍，小学增加了百分之九十二；医院病床一九五七年达到一千六百一十张，比一九五二年增加将近二点七倍，比一九四九年增加了十六倍，医疗防疫机构一九五七年达到一百四十七所、比一九五二年增加了一点八倍，比一九四九年增加了十五点三倍；电影放映队，解放前根本没有，一九五七年起，已有一百一十一队，比一九五二年增加七点五倍；广播发电力一九五七年比一九五二年增加了十倍多，并新建了十二个有线广播站。
    少数民族文教、卫生事业的发展更为迅速。文教方面已建立了民族学院一所，民族师范七所，民族小学由一九五二年的一百八十七所增到四百八十七所。一九五七年在校学生人数，民族学院和中等学校的少数民族学生达二千八百四十七人，比一九五二年增加十二点六倍。民族小学学生达四千八百人，比一九五二年增加近一点五倍。卫生方面，解放以来在牧业区先后建立了人民医院三十二所、性病和鼠疫防治所五所，病床达七百四十二张。此外，为了满足少数民族人民的文化需要，还先后成立了民族歌舞剧团和文化服务队，创办了藏文报纸，出版了七十三种少数民族文字图书。由于民族文教、卫生工作的发展，在我省少数民族人民中进一步体现了党对少数民族的关怀，因而大大提高了少数民族的爱国思想。
    争取实现一九五八年的生产大跃进  在民族团结基础上领导群众大生产
    第一个五年计划的成就是巨大的。我省一九五八年的任务，就是根据第一个五年计划的成就和当前的形势及今后发展的需要而制订的极其现实的奋斗目标。一九五八年是我们在第一个五年计划圆满完成的基础上胜利迈入第二个五年计划的第一年，这是非常重要的一年。当此我们在社会主义革命在政治战线上和思想战线上都已取得伟大胜利的条件下，在我省党和政府的正确领导下，坚决依靠人民群众，在民族关系更加团结的基础上，组织领导群众进行大生产。同时，不断克服右倾思想，实事求是地提高计划的指标。现在关于一九五八年的任务，我仅提出以下几个主要方面。
    首先关于农业、水利、林业、畜牧业方面：一九五八年在农业生产上应以提高单位面积产量为主，并且积极开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积，大力增产粮食，适当发展油料和其他技术作物。计划开荒十六万三千亩。粮食增产计划，一九五八年在一九五七年十二亿八千万斤的基础上，增产二亿八千万斤，为原有产量的百分之二十一点八七。油料播种面积六十一万二千亩，总产量达到六千三百三十二万六千四百斤。为保证实现粮食增产任务，必须：（一）大力兴修农田水利，今年计划水利工程达到一百零一万四千四百八十五亩，目前全省已经完成水利工程二十万亩；（二）大量积肥、造肥，本年要每亩施肥量较一九五七年增加百分之二十五至三十；（三）加强土壤改良的研究和试验工作，柴达木地区的洗碱工作，亦应积极进行；（四）积极繁殖和推广适合当地条件的优良品种，教育农民精耕细作，改变工作方法，加强田间管理；（五）有计划的进行山区规划，充分发挥山区潜力，因地制宜开展多种经营，大力进行水土保持工作。
    林业方面：本着“群众为主，国营为辅”的原则，大力开展造林、育苗和采种工作，计划造林十七万亩，育苗一万三千亩，采种四十六万亩。
    畜牧业和农业有互相依存的关系，是我省广大牧民群众赖以生存和发展的主要经济，大力发展畜牧业，就是在我省贯彻民族平等团结政策的主要环节之一。我省牧业区一九五八年应在继续加强民族团结的基础上，加强统一战线工作，巩固社会治安，贯彻执行以往党和国家的既定政策，和“在积极而又稳步地进行社会主义改造的基础上，发展畜牧业，逐步改游牧为定居放牧，实行农牧业结合（首先是饲料生产）。兼营畜产品加工业等副业生产，发展以畜牧业为中心的多种经济”的方针。广泛深入地开展以大力发展畜牧业为主要内容的群众工作，掀起一个畜牧业生产的高潮。全省各种牲畜头数，计划达到一千八百五十五万二千头（匹），比一九五七年预计增长百分之八。
    关于工业生产方面：计划一九五八年工业总产值比一九五七年预计增长百分之五点六九；国家及省掌握的三十四种工业产品量大部分都在增长，为了部分的解决国家和省内对一些原材料和矿产品的需要，一九五八年要有条件地积极地用土法开采金属矿和非金属矿，初步列入计划开采的有黄金、土铁、水晶矿石、铬铁矿石、铅锌矿石。在基本建设方面：一九五八年全省投资总额比一九五七年有所增加，而其中用于地方工业、交通运输、电力事业的占百分之五十四左右。通过国家投资新增主要生产能力，一九五八年大约为：电力设备容量三千瓩；煤的年开采能力为十五万吨，制革十万张，造纸三百吨，公路新增里程一百五十公里；载重汽车一百六十五部，客车三十五部。
    关于完成上述主要生产任务在我省是具备了有利的条件。现仅就实现农业生产大跃进的条件来讲：（一）经过农村社会主义大辩论，有力地打击了不法地主、富农分子及其他坏分子的破坏活动，批判了资本主义思想，坚定了各族农民走社会主义道路的决心；（二）经过了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的学习和一些场、社高额丰产事例的出现，进一步批判了右倾思想，明确了方向，鼓舞了信心，广大干部、群众生产积极性空前高涨；（三）经过整改，合作社在巩固和提高方面大大地迈进了一步，大批干部充实基层和下放生产，大大加强了农业生产战线；（四）以兴修水利和积肥为中心的冬季生产高潮，为农业大跃进准备了良好的物质基础。
    目前我省在促进社会主义生产高涨的条件下，省委决定：首先从省委的领导起，预计以四十天的时间，采取大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的方法，大力进行整改。省委这一正确坚决的措施，我想对于进一步加强党的集体领导，更正确地贯彻中央的方针、政策和指示，更好地领导群众千方百计地争取实现一九五八年的生产大跃进，是有决定意义的。通过这次整改，肯定的将更有力的促使社会主义建设事业胜利前进。
    现在摆在我们面前的光荣任务就是要在第一个五年计划的基础上，努力完成和超额完成一九五八年的任务，这是迈进第二个五年计划的重要关键。但是目前我省比起全国各地还是十分落后的，在今后建设的长途上不免会遇到许多困难。以前我省由于经济基础薄弱，建设资金大部分依靠国家拨款，在今天国家财力和物力还不十分充裕的情况下，我省建设事业自然会受到一些限制，今后我们除去国家的大力支援以外，更要依靠自己的坚强努力。我们既要有一定要把青海建设好的信心，更要有坚苦奋斗、白手起家的决心，有了信心和决心，就有了充沛的革命干劲，这个干劲肯定地保证我们能够彻底贯彻国家“勤俭建国”的方针，圆满完成我省一九五八年的艰巨任务。
    我省地广人稀，不仅农业、畜牧业有很大的潜在力量，而且在工业上蕴藏着丰富的金属矿藏和非金属矿藏，我们坚信在党的正确领导下，依靠广大人民群众，并在全国人民的大力支援下，一定能够在青海建设起祖国的重要工业基地，和大力发展农、牧事业，使它为祖国的社会主义建设事业发挥应有的作用。这个光明伟大的前景，大大鼓舞我省各族人民同全国人民在一起，以无比豪迈的革命英雄气概，意志昂扬地立志奋斗十五年，响应和实现党“十五年或者稍多一点时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国”的伟大号召。让六亿人民组成的东方巨龙乘风破浪前进，再前进。
