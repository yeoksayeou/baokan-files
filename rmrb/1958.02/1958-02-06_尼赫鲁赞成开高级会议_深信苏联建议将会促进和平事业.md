    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 5th. "The Statesman" today published the full text of Indian Prime Minister Nehru's reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin.

    In his reply, Nehru said, "We agree with your view that a high-level meeting is desirable and necessary. We would welcome such a meeting, whether it is limited to a few countries or involves more countries."

    Nehru believes that "the urgent need today is for the Soviet Union and the United States to reach an agreement on the proposal to hold a meeting."

    He also said in the letter, "Every effort should be made to break the deadlock on the disarmament issue and to ease the tensions arising from the Cold War."

    Nehru thanked Bulganin for his proposal to invite India to participate in a high-level meeting. Nehru said, "If everyone wants us to participate in such a meeting and we feel that we can contribute to the cause of peace by doing so, we will be happy to consider such an invitation."
