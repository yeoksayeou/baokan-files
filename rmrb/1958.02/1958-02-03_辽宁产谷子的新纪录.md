New Millet Record in Liaoning

(Our report) The Lianhe Agricultural Cooperative in Gaozhangzi Township, Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province, achieved a new record for millet production in Liaoning in 1957. The cooperative's director, Mao Zonghuai, personally cultivated 7.34 hectares of high-yield fields, achieving an average yield of 10,200 jin per hectare. Additionally, 8.4 hectares of high-yield fields yielded an average of 8,379 jin per hectare. These high-yield fields produced two to three times more than ordinary fields.

The Lianhe Cooperative is located in a mountainous area of western Liaoning with poor natural conditions. The surrounding area is characterized by barren mountains and severe soil erosion, resulting in poor soil quality. Over 70% of the cooperative's cultivated land consists of hillside fields. However, due to the efforts of cadres in cultivating high-yield fields and the high production enthusiasm of the cooperative members, they overcame disasters and gained experience in achieving "10,000-jin fields" of millet. This success has convinced the cooperative members that mountainous areas also possess great potential for increased production. As a result, the members are eager to create "10,000-jin fields" in every team this year and have already launched a production upsurge for this goal since autumn.

　　辽宁产谷子的新纪录
    本报讯　辽宁省凌源县高杖子乡联合农业社，1957年社主任毛宗怀亲自培育七点三四公顷丰产田，首创辽宁谷子最高纪录，平均每公顷产量达到一万零二百市斤，另外有八点四公顷丰产田平均每公顷产量达八千三百七十九市斤，这些丰产田比一般的增产二到三倍以上。
    联合社位于辽宁西部的一个山区，自然条件不好，周围净是童山秃岭，水土流失严重，土质瘠薄，全社耕地有70％以上是山坡地。但由于干部培育丰产田，社员生产热情高，战胜了灾害，获得了谷子“万斤田”的经验，使联合社社员一致认识到山区也有极大的增产潜力，因而社员迫切要求今年队队都搞“万斤田”，并且从秋天就掀起了搞“万斤田”的生产高潮。
