　　Bao Ding Plain Reservoirs Are Dotted Like Stars
　　Providing a Good Example for Developing Plain Water Conservancy
　　
Our Dispatch from Baoding, 19th: (Reporter Zhang Chao) After three months of tireless work by the broad masses of farmers, more than 170 reservoirs have appeared like stars scattered across the plains of the Baoding Special District, Hebei Province.  Xu Shui County alone has more than 120, and is in the process of establishing a plain water conservancy and irrigation network with reservoirs connected to reservoirs and canals connected to canals.  The achievements of this county can be summarized as follows: Nine cubic feet of earth per mu, only three workdays spent, eliminating drought, waterlogging, and floods.  A good example has been set for developing plain water conservancy.

　　The reservoirs already built and to be built in the Baoding Special District, together with other various water conservancy projects in the mountainous and plain areas, will basically achieve water conservancy for the entire district this year, guaranteeing that over 80% of the cultivated land will be free from the threat of drought, waterlogging, and flood disasters.  The farmers say with full confidence: From now on, we will no longer be afraid of big floods and big droughts.

　　The experience of Xu Shui County is particularly worth promoting.

　　Focusing on storage is a major change in the water conservancy construction policy of Xu Shui County (and the entire special district). The plain reservoirs already built in this county are divided into two types: one is flood storage crop reservoirs, also known as "grape cluster reservoirs," scattered along both banks of rivers and connected to the river, resembling a string of grapes; the other is runoff storage crop reservoirs, also known as "starry sky reservoirs," scattered across the vast plains, resembling stars in the sky. Both types of reservoirs focus on water storage. During the flood season, floodwater and runoff are introduced into the reservoirs, and during the dry season, water is released to irrigate the surrounding cultivated land, which can prevent floods and waterlogging, as well as drought, thereby reversing the long-standing negative ideology and practice of mainly discharging water. Most of this county is plain, with three harmful rivers (Cao River, Pu River, and Ping River) within its boundaries. Heavy rains cause floods, and droughts turn them into dry rivers. The terrain is high in the west and low in the east. Rain causes waterlogging in the east and drought in the west. Therefore, the masses and cadres have long hated and feared water. In recent years, the focus of water conservancy construction has been on flood discharge, but it has still not fundamentally eliminated drought, waterlogging, and flood disasters, resulting in slow growth in production. Last year, there was a severe drought, and the average yield per mu was only 214 jin. It was not until the winter of 1957, after studying and visiting the experience of Jiyuan County, Henan Province, in fundamentally controlling the Mang River, that the hate and fear of water turned into a desire and love for water, and the policy of focusing on storage was determined.

　　Adhering to small-scale projects as the main approach. The vast majority of the plain reservoirs already built in Xu Shui County (and the entire special district) are small-scale. By utilizing a large number of scattered, small, low-lying areas and low-lying areas on both sides of rivers, and building an embankment, a reservoir is formed. Except for water gates, all are earthworks. Therefore, the project is the simplest, most labor-saving, and most money-saving. Evenly distributed throughout the territory, benefiting in the same year. The entire reservoir project of over 4 million cubic feet of earth only used over 1.2 million workdays. Taking the 450,000 mu of flooded area in 1954 as the calculation, an average of only nine cubic feet of earth per mu, less than three workdays, can prevent the same flood disaster. Secondly, the water depth of the reservoirs is generally only one or two meters, and reeds, lotus roots, or early-maturing, waterlogging-resistant crops can also be planted in the reservoir (hence the name crop reservoir), and trees can be planted outside the embankment. After flood sediment is deposited, the soil inside the reservoir can also be improved. These advantages of small reservoirs thoroughly overcome the erroneous idea of simply relying on large reservoirs, greatly improving the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres.

　　Relying mainly on the communes is a policy that Xu Shui County (and the entire special district) has implemented most thoroughly. The state only subsidized 19,000 yuan for all the earthwork projects. The "Treasure Bowl" small reservoir in Da Wang Dian Township only cost the township People's Committee a dime to buy red paper to make a few glory flowers to encourage agricultural cooperative members who were working around the clock to rush to repair the reservoir. According to a leading comrade of the Baoding Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, the state spent 140,000 yuan on building a medium-sized reservoir with a storage capacity of 6.3 million cubic feet in An Xin County last year, while the state only spent more than 10,000 yuan on building a medium-sized reservoir with a storage capacity of over 10 million cubic feet in Xu Shui County this winter.

　　In the process of building plain reservoirs, the broad masses of farmers in Xu Shui County demonstrated the spirit of revolutionary heroism and collectivism. The heroic slogan "If the mind doesn't freeze, the ground won't freeze" resounded throughout the townships and villages. In the fields, it was truly a sea of people during the day and a sea of lights at night. Sixteen thousand agricultural cooperative members from twelve townships worked day and night for eight days to build the Shi Ge Zhuang Reservoir with a storage capacity of over 10 million cubic feet. At the same time, in this plain reservoir construction, townships and townships, villages and villages, cooperatives and cooperatives supported each other and cooperated closely. Xu Shui County is also preparing to build a larger plain reservoir on the border, so that the farmland in An Xin County can also be irrigated, turning water disputes into unity, building reservoirs together, and using water together.

　　At present, the broad masses of farmers in Xu Shui County and the entire special district are continuing to move forward, riding the wind and waves. Their goal is: Work hard for a year, double the yield per mu, guarantee 500 jin, and cross the Yellow River this year. (Attached picture)

### 每亩九方土　只花三个工　消灭旱涝洪  保定平原水库星罗棋布  为发展平原水利树立了良好榜样

    每亩九方土　只花三个工　消灭旱涝洪
    保定平原水库星罗棋布
    为发展平原水利树立了良好榜样
    本报保定19日电　记者张潮报道：在广大农民夜以继日地苦战三个月之后，河北省保定专区的平原上，星罗棋布地出现了一百七十多座水库。徐水一个县就有一百二十多座，并且正在建立库库相连、渠渠相通的平原水利灌溉网。这个县的成就可以概括如下：每亩九方土，只花三个工，消灭旱涝洪。发展平原水利有了一个好榜样。
    保定专区已经建成和将要建成的水库，加上山区和平原其他各种水利工程，使全区今年就基本上实现了水利化，保证80％以上耕地免受旱、涝、洪三灾的威胁。农民们满怀信心地说：从此，再不怕大水和大旱了。
    徐水县的经验，特别值得提倡。
    以蓄为主，是徐水县（和全专区）平原水利建设方针的重大改变。这个县已建成的平原水库分为两种，一种是蓄洪作物水库，又名“葡萄串水库”，散布在河流两岸，与河相通，宛如一串葡萄。一种是蓄沥作物水库，又名“满天星水库”，散布在广大平原上，宛如满天星斗。两种水库都以蓄水为主，汛期把洪水和沥水引入水库，旱期放水灌溉周围耕地，既可防洪、防涝，又可防旱，从而扭转了长期存在的以泄为主的消极思想和作法。这个县大部分是平原，境内有三条害河（漕河、瀑河和萍河），大雨发洪水，天旱变干河。地势西高东洼，有雨东部涝，无雨西部旱。因此，群众和干部长期以来恨水怕水。几年来因水利建设重点是以排洪泄水为主，结果仍不能从根本上消灭旱、涝、洪三灾，以致产量增长很慢。去年大旱，平均亩产量只有二百一十四斤。直到1957年冬季，学习和参观了河南省济源县根治漭河的经验，才由恨水怕水变为想水爱水，确定了以蓄为主的方针。
    坚持以小型为主。在徐水县（和全专区）已经建成的平原水库，绝大部分是小型的。利用大量分散的零星低洼地和河流两边的低洼地，筑起一道围堤，就成水库。除水闸外，全部是土方。因此工程最简单，最省工，最省钱。匀布全境，当年受益。全部水库四百多万土方工程，只用了一百二十多万个工。以1954年水灾面积四十五万亩计算，平均每亩只要九方土，不到三个工，就可以防止同样的水灾。其次，水库一般水深只有一、二公尺，库内还可种植苇、藕或早熟耐涝作物（因而又称作物水库），堤外可植树。淤积洪水后，还可改良库内土壤。小型水库的这些优点，彻底克服了单纯依赖大型水库的错误思想，大大地提高了群众和干部的干劲。
    以社办为主，是徐水县（和全专区）执行得最彻底的一个方针。全部土方工程，国家只补助一万九千元。大王店乡“聚宝盆”小型水库，乡人民委员会只花了一角钱，买红纸作了几朵光荣花，来鼓励不分昼夜突击修库的农业社员。据中共保定地委的一位领导同志说：去年安新县兴建一个蓄水六百三十万方的中型水库，国家出了十四万元，而徐水县入冬兴建的一个蓄水一千多万方的中型水库，国家只出了一万多元。
    在建设平原水库的过程中，徐水县广大农民表现了革命英雄主义的气概和集体主义的精神。各乡各村响遍了“思想不冻地就不冻”的豪迈口号。田野上，真个是白天一片人海，夜里一片灯海。十二个乡联合兴建蓄水一千多万方的史各庄水库，一万六千个农业社员突击八昼夜，就建成了。同时，在这次平原水库建设中，乡与乡、村与村、社与社之间，互相支援，密切合作。徐水县还准备在边境兴建一座较大的平原水库，让安新县的农田也能灌溉，变水利纠纷为团结建库，共同用水。
    目前，徐水县和全专区的广大农民，正在乘风破浪地继续前进。他们的目标是：苦战一年，亩产翻一翻，保证五百斤，今年过黄河。（附图片）
