Unbreakable Friendship
Dubrovina
Vice-Chairman of the Soviet-China Friendship Association

What is more precious than money? Friendship.
What is stronger than steel? Friendship.
What is more powerful than a storm? Friendship.
		—Chinese Proverb

Today, the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China jointly celebrate this significant day—the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

This treaty holds extremely great significance for the people of our two countries and for all mankind. As everyone knows, this treaty is broad in scope, stipulating joint defense against imperialist aggression, cooperation in various international activities to ensure world peace and security, and mutual assistance in China's construction of socialism and the Soviet Union's construction of communism. The great alliance of two great socialist countries sharing a common destiny becomes a powerful force for consolidating the socialist camp and a pillar for the people of all countries in their struggle for peace and a happy future.

The people of our two countries have a traditional friendship. Every revolutionary action of the Chinese people has found sympathy and support among the Russian people. The great Lenin once profoundly and clearly expressed the position taken by revolutionary Russia regarding the Chinese people's struggle against foreign aggressors and internal oppressors. Lenin often emphasized the unity of the Russian proletariat and the Chinese masses, emphasizing the similarity and consistency of their interests.

The Great October Socialist Revolution laid the foundation for a brand-new relationship between the Russian and Chinese peoples. As everyone knows, one of the many decrees of the young Soviet state was to renounce all the privileges of the Tsarist government in China. On May 31, 1924, the Sino-Soviet Treaty was signed—the first equal treaty signed by China with a powerful country.

The Soviet people closely watched and deeply sympathized with the long and astonishingly heroic struggle of the Chinese people to liberate themselves from the aggression of Japan, Britain, and the United States, and from the internal counter-revolutionary forces. October 1, 1949, the day the Chinese people finally achieved victory and complete liberation, the day the forever free and independent People's Republic of China was proclaimed, was an extremely great and celebratory holiday for the Soviet people.

I had the honor of welcoming this festival in China as a member of the Soviet cultural delegation on this historic day, seeing the joy and jubilation of the Chinese people like a rising spring tide, and feeling the solemn greatness of the events that were taking place. I can say with complete accuracy that time cannot wear away the impressions gained during those extraordinary and soul-stirring days; on the contrary, it only serves to strengthen the feelings of joy and excitement for the Chinese people that filled my heart during those days.

From that time on, friendship began to enter a completely new stage between the great people of our two countries, between our two heroic peoples who had proved to the world the greatest transformative power of the proletarian socialist revolution.

On the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the friendly ties between our peoples and countries have taken on a more large-scale and planned approach. Multi-faceted, sincere, and selfless mutual assistance, deep mutual respect, and attention to national characteristics have brought rich fruits to the friendship between our two peoples.

The Soviet people listened with pride to the speech of Comrade Mao Zedong, leader of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the People's Republic of China, at the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution held by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and saw with joy the truly significant achievements of the Chinese people in all aspects of socialist construction and the transformation of their country. At the same time, they are deeply interested in the path taken by the Chinese people, loyal to the great principles of Marxism-Leninism, and suitable for their own unique creation.

In a very short historical period, the People's China has basically realized the socialist revolution on the economic front. An industrialized strong country is replacing the backward old China. The task of establishing its own heavy industry is being successfully resolved. Land reform and the fundamental transformation of agriculture on the basis of cooperation have been realized. The socialist economic system has demonstrated its great superiority in all aspects.

The Chinese people are confidently looking to their future, and are putting forward new and huge tasks for themselves. The movement, widely launched throughout the country according to the call of the Chinese Communist Party, to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within the next fifteen years is one of the brilliant manifestations of this. There is no doubt that this task can be accomplished. Because the Chinese people, as a giant, are advancing with great strides.

Just think about the fact that China's machine manufacturing production is now four times that of 1952, and one hundred and thirty times the highest annual output of the Kuomintang's old China in 1936; the construction of new industrial enterprises is progressing at such a speed that, for example, in 1957, a new enterprise was put into production every forty-nine hours.

These facts make the Soviet people especially happy and proud, first for the Chinese people, but also for the Soviet people. The Soviet people, as the elder brother, who first accumulated experience in socialist construction, have shared and will continue to generously share this experience with the Chinese people, giving their brothers—the Chinese people—material and technical assistance. We cannot but be happy that our Chinese friends have given high praise to this assistance.

Continuing to further expand cultural ties between our two peoples is of great significance. For example, expanding the exchange of delegations of scientists, artists, and educators, organizing tours by theatrical troupes and other artistic groups, organizing various exhibitions, and joint scientific and technical conferences and specialized meetings.

We have now moved from taking individual measures to formulating and implementing long-term cultural cooperation agreements. We regard the cultural exchange between the two countries and a deeper understanding of each other's cultures as an important way to promote the further rise of the culture of our two peoples and to cultivate international solidarity and fraternal friendship.

In the Soviet Union, interest in the ancient culture of the Chinese people, especially in its modern cultural life, is constantly growing. The numerous delegations that have visited China, the experts invited by the Chinese government to work in China, unanimously said when talking about their impressions that they have gained rich things in their exchanges with the Chinese people, with their intellectuals and workers in education, literature, art, and science. In order to more deeply and systematically satisfy the growing interest of the broadest masses of people in Chinese culture, we organized the Soviet-China Friendship Association, in the same way as the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established earlier in China.

I still remember the founding conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held in Beijing in October 1949. I remember the solemn and exciting scene in a hall of the former palace where the founding conference was held, the warm conversations, the friendly handshakes, the warm reception given to the Soviet delegation, and the rapid mutual understanding that personal acquaintance and even language barriers could not hinder. I can never forget the excitement I felt because the glorious task of speaking at the conference on behalf of the Soviet delegation fell on me.

The purpose of the Soviet-China Friendship Association, established in our country last October, is to help further develop and consolidate the fraternal friendship and cooperation between our great peoples, expand cultural cooperation, comprehensively exchange experiences in cultural construction with the People's Republic of China, and help the Chinese people gain a comprehensive understanding of the life and labor of the Soviet people.

The Soviet-China Friendship Association carries out its work on a broad social basis. Its organization includes famous scholars, social activists, representatives from the cultural, scientific, and technological fields, workers, and farmers. Last November, government delegations from the Soviet Union and China signed the 1958 cultural cooperation agreement between the two countries. This agreement stipulates the mutual exchange of theatrical troupes and other artistic groups, the expansion of ties between the theatrical and musical circles of the two countries, the exchange of repertoire plans, letters, musical scores, stage design sketches, and so on. It also stipulates the continued consolidation and deepening of ties between the music, drama, dance, art, and film schools of the two countries. The agreement stipulates the cooperative production of feature films, popular science films, and documentary films, the exchange of film production plans, and also stipulates future ties between museums and libraries. The creative cooperation between the writers' associations, artists, and composers of the Soviet Union and China, as stipulated therein, is also of great significance. The ties in publishing and printing will also be further expanded. The agreement also significantly stipulates the exchange of experience in higher education and secondary education, such as the exchange of expert delegations, the mutual sending of students, graduate students, and teachers, the cooperative compilation of textbooks, the exchange of standard architectural drawings for university and middle school buildings, the exchange of important teaching materials, and the expansion of scientific research cooperation in higher education institutions. The exchange of experience in health care is also made a due series of provisions in the agreement.

The implementation of this agreement will make a huge contribution to further consolidating and expanding the friendship between the people of the two countries and the mutual exchange of rich cultural aspects.

The scientific and technological cooperation protocol signed by the governments of the Soviet Union and China in Moscow this January is another proof of the deepening friendship that is developing day by day. This protocol stipulates that the Soviet Union will help realize China's long-term plan for developing scientific research from 1956 to 1967. It also stipulates that from 1958 to 1962, the Soviet Union and China will jointly cooperate in the study of 122 important scientific and technological problems of great significance to China. According to the provisions of the protocol, more than 600 famous scholars and experts from the Soviet side will participate in this work.

The important task before us is to further enable the people of the two countries to understand each other's history, their current lives, their material and spiritual cultural life, and their plans and prospects for a bright future. One of the reliable ways to achieve this task is to study languages and publish books. Soviet people are very interested in Chinese political and literary works. Mao Zedong's works have been printed 44 times in 18 languages in our country, with a total of 2,453,000 copies. Lu Xun's works have been printed 41 times, with a total of about 2 million copies, Zhao Shuli's works have been published 17 times, with a print run of about 1 million copies, Mao Dun's works have been published 18 times, with a print run of 706,000 copies, and so on.

Soviet literature has received great love in China. We are very happy to point out that Russian is being widely studied in China, and we all know and attach great importance to the words of Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: "If you want to do your job well, then you must first sharpen your tools. Only by learning Russian well and firmly mastering it can we truly gain the valuable experience of the Soviet Union in the cause of socialist construction and promote the friendly mutual assistance and cultural ties between the two great peoples." The Chinese people are consistent in their words and deeds. Russian classes are being taught in all higher education institutions in China, as well as in many middle schools and technical schools. Russian colleges have been established in Beijing, Shanghai, and Harbin. There are also many Russian self-study groups. Nearly 30 percent of higher technical intellectuals read Russian professional books.

Just as the Yihetuan (Boxer) Uprising was fiercely carrying out an anti-imperialist armed uprising, the great Russian writer Gorky wrote to Chekhov: "Dear Anton Pavlovich! Shall we go to China? Once in Yalta you said, let's go. Let's go! I really want to go there. I myself want to suggest a few people go as reporters. Let's go! Dear Anton Pavlovich." At that time, Gorky's ardent wish could not be realized, but now times are different. Thousands of Soviet people, workers of the Soviet state, scholars and writers, artists and musicians, engineers and workers, agricultural producers, teachers and doctors excitedly crossed the Sino-Soviet border and set foot on the land of their 600 million friends. How many amazing impressions, how many profound and pure thoughts and feelings they gained on the land of China! I believe that no one who has been to China is not impressed by the amazing appeal of the wise and humble, brave and hardworking, talented and kind Chinese people. The very wise work of educating people, organized and led by the great Chinese Communist Party, is being carried out among people of all ages. While launching a principled and irreconcilable struggle against the enemies of people's democracy and conducting an open and relentless struggle against the rightists who attempt to oppose China's socialist construction, extensive measures are also taken to conduct political education among the people and to educate the people with the most advanced ideas of the modern era.

Our people are marching on the road of friendship. We call the Almaty-Lanzhou railway line, which is under construction, the "Road of Friendship." Soviet and Chinese scholars are walking the road of friendship, jointly studying new scientific problems in conquering deserts, harnessing the Yenisei River and the Yellow River, and mastering interstellar space. Filmmakers are walking the road of friendship, working together to create films. Other workers are also consolidating our friendship with concrete work.

The Road of Friendship! How much is contained in these few words! I am reminded of a meeting with the Chinese people, which can also be called the "Road of Friendship"... A very warm mass meeting between the Soviet delegation and Chinese friends was held on a square in Jinan City, Shandong Province. After the speeches were over, Chinese friends solemnly presented a precious ivory product to the delegation as a gift to the Soviet people. Several lively and cheerful Chinese children with bright eyes, wearing workers' clothes with red five-pointed stars on their chests, ran to the stage and presented each of us with a large bouquet of flowers. The meeting was over, and it seemed that we could leave. But suddenly the comrade translator gave us a note that had just been handed up, which was written in Chinese characters: "Dear comrades, dear friends! We really want to meet you, but we are standing very far away, so we can't see you. We ask you to come down so that we can see you." We had barely stood for a few minutes, and there were 40,000 people on the square. It seemed that there was no strength to get through such a large crowd. At this time, a Chinese comrade suggested: "Let the band walk in front of you." We happily said: "Let's go!" So the Chinese band walked in front of us. I still remember the sound of the Chinese drums and cymbals. The crowd slowly made way, forming a wide passage. The band walked in front, and we Soviet representatives followed behind them. At first we walked smoothly, and we passed our flowers to our Chinese friends. But the passage in the crowd gradually became narrower and narrower. Finally, we could only walk one after another, as if in the aisle of a train, almost merging with the vast masses. Comrades, can such an unusual walk be forgotten! Thousands of hands constantly shook our hands, and thousands of happy faces with enthusiastic eyes and smiles were with us. The shouts of thousands of constantly repeated welcome slogans: "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" "Long live our Soviet brothers!" "Glory belongs to the Soviet Union!" "Long live the Soviet people!" This was a truly unforgettable moment of happiness for me!

Dear comrades, long live the permanent and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people!
May our rock-solid unity in the struggle for the happiness of our people today and for a more prosperous future be further consolidated!
Long live the great leader of the Chinese people and the wise Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the Chinese people!

### 无比坚强的友谊

    无比坚强的友谊
    苏中友好协会副主席　杜勃罗维娜
    什么比金钱更宝贵？友谊。
    什么比钢铁更坚强？友谊。
    什么比暴风更强大？友谊。
                      ——中国谚语
    今天，苏联和中华人民共和国人民共同庆祝这个有意义的日子——中苏友好同盟互助条约签订八周年。
    这个条约对于我们两国人民，对于全人类都有极其伟大的意义。正如大家所知道的，这个条约范围很广，它规定了共同防御帝国主义的侵略，规定了在保障世界和平安全方面各种国际活动的合作，也规定了在中国建设社会主义和在苏联建设共产主义中的互相帮助。两个共命运同呼吸的伟大社会主义国家的伟大联盟，成为巩固社会主义阵营的强大力量，成为世界各国人民为和平与幸福的将来而斗争的支柱。
    我们两国人民有传统的友谊。中国人民的每一革命行动，都从俄罗斯人民中找到了同情和赞助。伟大的列宁曾经深刻而明确地表示过革命的俄罗斯对于中国人民反对异族侵略者和内部压迫者的斗争所采取的立场。列宁经常强调俄罗斯无产阶级和中国人民群众的团结，强调他们利益的相同和一致。
    伟大十月社会主义革命给俄罗斯人民和中国人民之间的崭新关系奠定了基础。正如大家所知道的，年青的苏维埃国家许多法令中的一个法令，就是放弃沙皇政府在中国所有的特权。1924年5月31日曾经签订了苏中条约——这是中国和一个强国所签订的第一个平等条约。
    苏联人民密切注意并深刻同情中国人民为从日本、英国、美国的侵略下求得解放，从内部反革命势力下求得解放所进行的长期而惊人的英勇斗争。1949年10月1日，中国人民终于获得胜利和完全解放的日子，永远自由独立的中华人民共和国宣布成立的日子，对于苏联人民来说是极其伟大和值得庆祝的节日。
    我有幸在这个有历史意义的日子里，作为苏联文化代表团成员在中国迎接了这个节日，看见了中国人民那种像春潮高涨似的喜悦和欢腾，感觉到了所发生的事件的庄严伟大。我可以完全正确地说，时间磨不去在那些不平凡的震撼人心的日子所获得的印象，相反地，只足以增强我为中国人民欢欣鼓舞的感情，这种感情在那些日子里曾充满了我的心怀。
    从那时起，在我们两国伟大人民之间，在我们两个曾经向世界证明了无产阶级社会主义革命最伟大的改造力量的英雄人民之间，友谊开始进入了完全崭新的阶段。
    当友好同盟互助条约签订八周年的时候，我们人民和国家之间的友好联系更加采取了大规模的有计划的方式。多方面的真诚无私的互相帮助，深刻的互相尊重，同时又注意到了民族的特点，给我们两国人民的友谊带来了丰富的成果。
    苏联人民以自豪的心情听到了中国共产党领导人、中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年大会上的讲话，以欢乐的心情看到中国人民在社会主义建设各方面和改造自己国家中所获得的真正重大的成就。同时对忠实于伟大马克思列宁主义原则的中国人民所走的适合于自己独创的道路深感兴趣。
    在很短的历史时期，人民中国基本上实现了经济战线上的社会主义革命。工业化的强国正在代替落后的旧中国。创立本国重工业的任务正在顺利地解决。土地改革和在合作化基础上根本改造农业已经实现。社会主义经济制度在各个方面都显示出了伟大的优越性。
    中国人民充满信心地注视着自己的未来，为自己提出新的巨大的任务。根据中国共产党的号召在全国广泛展开的、在最近十五年内在钢铁和其它重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的运动，就是这种事例的光辉表现之一。毫无疑问，这个任务能够完成。因为中国人民作为一个巨人，是用巨大的步伐前进的。
    只要想想这个事实就明白了：现在中国机器制造生产相当于1952年的四倍，相当于国民党旧中国1936年最高年产量的一百三十倍；新的工业企业的建设是以如此的速度前进的，比如说，在1957年每经过四十九小时就有一个新企业投入生产。
    这些事实使苏联人特别高兴和骄傲，首先为中国人民，同时也为苏联人民而高兴和骄傲。苏联人民作为老大哥，第一个积累了社会主义建设经验，他们过去和将来都毫不吝啬地和中国人民分享这些经验，给予自己的兄弟——中国人民物资上和技术上的援助。中国朋友对这种援助给以很高的评价，我们不能不为此高兴。
    继续进一步扩大我们两国人民之间在文化方面的联系具有巨大的意义。例如扩大交换科学、艺术、教育工作者代表团，组织剧团和其它艺术团体的旅行演出，组织各种展览会、共同的科学技术代表会议和专门会议等。
    我们现在已经从采取个别的措施转到拟订和执行长期的文化合作协定了。我们把两国文化交流和更深入了解每个国家的文化部门，作为促使我们两国人民的文化进一步高涨及培养国际团结和兄弟友好精神的重要方式。
    在苏联，对于中国人民古老文化的兴趣，特别是对它的现代文化生活的兴趣正在不断地增长。访问了中国的为数众多的代表团，被中国政府邀请在中国工作的专家，在谈到自己的印象时，一致地说到，在同中国人民，同它的知识界和教育、文学、艺术、科学工作者交往中得到了丰富的东西。为了更加深入地、有系统地满足最广泛的人民群众对中国文化这种日益增长的兴趣，我们按照早先在中国成立的中苏友好协会的方式，组织了苏中友好协会。
    我还记得1949年10月在北京举行的中苏友好协会成立大会。记得当时在开成立大会的从前皇宫的一座大厅里的那种庄严和令人激动的情景，记得那些热烈的谈话，友好的握手，给予苏联代表团的热烈的接待，个人的结识和甚至语言不通也不能阻碍的迅速的相互了解。任何时候我也不能忘记我所感受的激动，因为受苏联代表团委托在大会上发言的光荣任务落在我的身上。
    去年10月在我国成立的苏中友好协会的目的，在于帮助我们伟大人民之间的兄弟友谊和合作进一步发展和巩固，扩大文化合作，同中华人民共和国全面地交换文化建设的经验，帮助中国人民对苏联人民生活和劳动作全面的了解。
    苏中友协在广泛的社会基础上进行着自己的工作。它的组织包括着著名的学者、社会活动家、文化、科学、技术界的代表、工人和农民。去年11月，苏中两国政府代表团签订了1958年两国文化合作协定。这个协定规定了相互交换戏剧团体和其他艺术团体，扩大两国之间的戏剧界和音乐界的联系，交换剧目计划、信件、乐谱、舞台布景略图等等。它还规定了继续巩固和加深两国音乐、戏剧、舞蹈、艺术、电影学校之间的联系。协定中规定合作摄制艺术影片、科学普及影片和纪录影片，交换电影片的摄制计划，也规定了今后博物馆和图书馆之间的联系。其中规定的苏联和中国作家协会之间，艺术家、作曲家之间的创作合作，也具有重要的意义。出版、印刷界的联系，也将进一步扩大。协定中还显著地规定了在高等教育和中等教育方面的经验交流工作，如交换专家代表团、互派留学生、研究生、教师，合作编篡教科书，交换大学和中学校舍标准建筑的图样，交换重要教材，以及扩大高等教学机关中的科学研究合作。有关交换卫生保健方面的经验，在协定中也作了应有的一系列规定。
    这个协定的实现将为进一步巩固和扩大两国人民之间的友谊和相互交流丰富的文化方面作出巨大的贡献。
    今年1月间苏中两国政府在莫斯科所签订的科学技术合作议定书，是日益发展着的深厚友谊的又一个证明。这项议定书规定了苏联将帮助实现1956年到1967年的中国发展科学研究的远景计划。它还规定了在1958年到1962年内苏中两国将共同合作研究一百二十二项对中国具有重大意义的重要科学技术问题。根据议定书的规定，苏联方面将有六百多个著名学者、专家参加这项工作。
    我们面前的重要任务是进一步使两国人民相互了解他们的历史、他们目前的生活、他们的物质和精神文化生活，以及他们的美好未来的计划和远景。为实现这一任务，可靠的方法之一是学习语言、出版书籍。苏联人对中国的政治和文学著作非常感到兴趣。毛泽东的著作在我国已用十八种语言印刷了四十四次，总印数达二百四十五万三千册。鲁迅作品印刷了四十一版，总印数达二百万册左右，赵树理作品出版了十七次，印数为一百万册左右，茅盾作品出版了十八次，印数为七十万六千册等等。
    苏联文学在中国受到了巨大的热爱。我们非常高兴地指出，在中国广泛地学习着俄文，我们都知道并非常重视中国科学院院长郭沫若所说的话：“如果你想做好自己的工作，那末，首先得磨锐自己的工具。只有很好地学习俄文并牢固地掌握了它，才能真正取得苏联在社会主义建设事业中的宝贵经验和促进两国伟大人民之间的友好互助和文化联系。”中国人民是言行一致的。在中国各高等教育机关，同时也在许多中学和技术学校里进行着俄文课教学。北京、上海、哈尔滨都建立了俄语专科学院。还有许多俄文自修小组。将近有百分之三十的高等技术知识分子阅读着俄文专业书籍。
    正当在义和团轰轰烈烈地进行着反帝国主义武装起义的日子里，伟大的俄国作家高尔基给契诃夫的信中写道：“亲爱的安东·巴甫洛维奇！我们到中国去好吗？有一次在雅尔塔你曾说过，我们去吧。去吧！我非常想到那里去。我自己想建议个把人去当记者。我们去吧！亲爱的安东·巴甫洛维奇。”那时高尔基的热烈的愿望没有能够实现，现在时代不同了。成千的苏联人，苏维埃国家的劳动者、学者和作家、艺术家和音乐家、工程师和工人、农业生产者、教师和医生激动地经过苏中国境，踏上自己六亿朋友的土地。他们在中国的土地上获得了多少令人惊奇的印象，多少深刻而纯洁的思想感情！我相信，没有一个到过中国的人不受到智慧而谦逊、勇敢而勤劳、天才而和善的中国人民的惊人的感召的。伟大的中国共产党所组织和领导的非常英明的对人的教育工作，正在各种年龄的人中进行着。在对人民民主的敌人展开有原则的不调和的斗争，对企图反对中国社会主义建设的右派分子进行公开和无情的斗争时，也采取了广泛措施来对人民进行政治教育，以现代最先进的思想教育人民。
    我们的人民在友谊的道路上行进。我们把正在建设的阿拉木图—兰州铁路干线称为“友谊之路”，苏联和中国的学者走着友谊的道路，他们共同研究着征服沙漠，治理叶尼塞河和黄河，掌握星际空间的新的科学问题。电影工作者走着友谊的道路，他们共同努力在创作电影。其他劳动者也都在用具体工作巩固着我们的友谊。
    友谊之路！这几个字中包含着多少东西啊！我想起了和中国人民的一次会见，这也能称作“友谊之路”……。在山东省济南市的一个广场上举行了一个非常热烈的苏联代表团和中国朋友的会见群众大会。讲话完毕以后，中国朋友隆重地把一个珍贵的象牙制品献给代表团作为给苏联人民的礼物。几个活泼愉快，眼睛明亮的中国儿童穿着胸前有五角红星的工人服跑到台上向我们每个人献了一大束鲜花。大会结束了，看来已可以走了。但是突然翻译同志给我们一个刚递上来的条子，上面写着中国字“亲爱的同志们，亲爱的朋友们！我们很想同你们见面，但是我们站的很远，因此看不到你们，我们请求你们下来，好让我们看看你们。”我们好不容易站了几分钟，广场上有四万人，看来是没有力气能穿过这样大的人群。这时有一个中国同志提议：“这样吧，让乐队走在你们前面。”我们很高兴地说：“走吧！”中国乐队就走在我们前面。中国鼓和铜钹的声音现在我还记得。人群慢慢地让开，形成了一条宽宽的通道。乐队走在前面，我们苏联代表们跟在他们后面。开头我们走得很顺利，我们把自己的鲜花传送给中国朋友。但是人群中的通道渐渐地越来越狭小了，最后我们只能一个跟着一个地走，就好像在列车的走道中那样，几乎和广大的群众汇合在一起了。同志们，这样不平常的走路能够忘记吗！几千只手不断地握着我们的手，几千个幸福的脸带着热情的眼睛和笑容和我们在一起。成千个不断重复着的欢迎口号的喊声：“中苏友谊万岁！”“我们的苏联兄弟万岁！”“光荣属于苏联！”“苏联人民万岁！”这是给我真正难忘的幸福的时刻！
    亲爱的同志们，苏中人民永久的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    祝我们在为我们人民幸福的今天和更幸福的未来的斗争中磐石般的团结更加巩固！
    中国人民的伟大领袖和英明的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民万岁！（附图片）
