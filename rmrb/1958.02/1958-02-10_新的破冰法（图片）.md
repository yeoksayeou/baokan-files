　　New Icebreaking Method
The staff of the Xinhailian Navigation Management Department in Jiangsu Province have created a new icebreaking method to ensure continued navigation after inland rivers freeze. This icebreaking method is called the "front-high, rear-low towing and pressing icebreaking method." It involves using bamboo to make a raft, placing a small boat on the raft, loading it with about one ton of stones, and attaching a rope to each side for people to pull. This method is more than ten times more efficient than the usual hammer-based icebreaking method. Look, a bamboo raft is breaking ice and advancing, followed closely by many ships carrying supplies for the Spring Festival. Photo by Li Xundun

　　新的破冰法
    江苏省新海连航运管理部门的职工，为了保证内河封冻后继续通航，创造了一种新的破冰法。这种破冰法叫做前高后低的拖压破冰法。就是用竹子打成一个竹筏，筏上加上一个小划子，里面装有一吨左右的石头，两侧各系一根绳用人来拖。用这种方法破冰比一般用鎯头打的破冰法效率提高十几倍。看，一个竹筏在破冰前进，后面就紧跟着许多装有供应春节物资的船只在航行。　李训敦摄
