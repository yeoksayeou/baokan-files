    Who Produces the Most Oil?
    Since the oil industry began promoting Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil pressing experience, oil yields have generally improved. Soybean oil yield has increased from below 10% to above 13%; rapeseed oil yield has increased from below 30% to above 35%; peanut kernel oil yield has increased from below 35% to above 39%; cottonseed oil yield has increased from below 10% to above 16%; and sesame oil yield has increased from below 45% to around 50%. However, the difference between the oil yield of backward and advanced factories is still significant. Zhenjiang Oil Factory in Jiangsu Province is a mechanical oil pressing factory, and its oil yield is the highest. After pressing oil from peanut kernels, the residual oil in the dry cake is only 3.2% on average. The residual oil in soybean dry cake is also 3.2%, and rapeseed dry cake has 5.28% residual oil. In the same type of mechanical oil pressing factory in Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, the residual oil rate in peanut dry cake is above 8%, resulting in more than five jin less peanut oil per hundred jin of peanut kernels. The difference between advanced and backward oil yields in traditional oil pressing factories is even greater. In Huangqiao Oil Factory in Jiangsu, rapeseed dry cake has only 6% residual oil, while in Ninghai Oil Factory in Zhejiang, the residual oil in rapeseed dry cake is as high as 16.72%, with 9% remaining even after pressing twice. The above situation shows that the oil industry has great potential to be tapped. (Attached chart)

    谁出的油最多？
    油脂工业推广李川江榨油先进经验以后，出油率普遍都有提高。大豆出油率由10％以下提高到13％以上；菜籽出油率由30％以下提高到35％以上，花生仁的出油率由35％以下提高到39％以上，棉籽出油率由10％以下提高到16％以上，芝麻出油率由45％以下提高到50％左右。但是出油率落后的和先进的相差很大。江苏省镇江油厂是个机榨油厂，这个厂出油率最高。花生仁榨出油以后，干饼里的残油平均只有3.2％，大豆的干饼残油也是3.2％，菜籽干饼残油5.28％，山东省聊城专区同样一个机榨油厂，花生干饼残油率在8％以上，每百斤花生仁，少出花生油五斤多。土榨油厂的出油率，先进和落后相差更大。江苏黄桥油厂，菜籽干饼残油只有6％，而浙江宁海油厂，菜籽的干饼残油高到16.72％，榨两次，还有9％。上述情况说明，油脂工业部门大有潜力可挖。（附图表）
