Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 17th: Indonesian newspapers today demanded that the government take decisive measures against the Central Sumatran rebels. The newspapers revealed that the traitorous group's rebellion was inseparable from the conspiracies of the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO).

    "Youth Daily" called for resolute steps to be taken against the traitorous elements. The newspaper pointed out that these elements are clearly serving as agents of foreign forces. "Youth Daily" said that the Indonesian people are determined to fight alongside the government and the army to resolutely combat them to the end.

    "Indonesia Torch" wrote that after President Sukarno's return, decisive steps would be taken in a short period of time to overcome the current difficulties. The newspaper said that all Indonesian people must unite as one, ready to unconditionally execute the President's orders.

    The Indonesian "People's Daily" demanded resolute measures against Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, the principal figure of the Central Sumatran rebel group. The newspaper also hoped that the Masjumi Party would express its stance on the rebellious actions of its members, Sjafruddin Prawiranegara and Harahap, principal figures of the Central Sumatran rebel group, and that the Indonesian Socialist Party would express its stance on the actions of its member, another principal rebel figure, Sumitro Djojohadikusumo.

    Today's "People's Daily" also exposed the conspiracy of the United States to support the Central Sumatran rebel group. The newspaper pointed out that it is noteworthy that the Hussein Group issued its "ultimatum" to the government immediately after U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made his undisguised statement interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. The subversive and divisive activities in Indonesia are clearly a concrete manifestation of the conspiracies of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Netherlands, and the American oil tycoons.

    "People's Daily" also revealed that the American "Steel Executive" vessel had transported forty-three cases of military supplies to the Central Sumatran rebel group's "Wild Bull Division Committee" at the end of last year. The United States is continuing to use military supplies to aid the Indonesian separatists.

    The newspaper said that in opposing American interference in Indonesia, the Indonesian government and people must remember the painful lessons of Guatemala, and avoid the situation of "chasing away the Dutch at the front door only to let the Americans squeeze in through the back door."

    The Indonesian National News Agency (Antara) revealed today that several ships named "Tunggeri," "Terminal," and "Wangari" had smuggled batches of American weapons packed in fruit crates to Dumai in Wangari, Central Sumatra.

    The news agency also revealed that recently many figures from Western countries, disguised as missionaries, have arrived in Padang to assist Hussein in training armed personnel in the use of new weapons. These people wear the uniforms of senior officers when training the troops, and usually wear missionary attire.

    印度尼西亚舆论重提危地马拉教训
    要求对卖国集团采取坚决措施
    揭露美国连续运军火接济叛乱分子
    新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚报纸今天要求政府对中苏门答腊叛乱分子采取坚决措施。报纸揭露，这个卖国集团的叛变行动是同美国和东南亚条约组织的阴谋分不开的。
    “青年报”要求对卖国分子采取坚决的步骤。这家报纸指出，这些分子显然是作为外国势力的代理人来为它们服务的。“青年报”说，印度尼西亚人民决心同政府和陆军一起，坚决同他们战斗到底。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”写道，在苏加诺总统回国以后，将会在短期间内采取果断的步骤，以便克服当前的困难。这家报纸说，全印度尼西亚人民必须团结成一体，准备无条件地执行总统的命令。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”要求对中苏门答腊叛乱集团的首要分子沙弗鲁丁采取坚决措施。这家报纸还希望政府要求马斯友美党对它的党员、中苏门答腊叛乱集团的首要分子沙弗鲁丁和哈拉哈普的叛乱行动表示态度，并且要求印度尼西亚社会党对它的党员、另一个首要叛乱分子苏米特罗的行动表示态度。
    今天的“人民日报”还揭露了美国支持中苏门答腊叛乱集团的阴谋活动。这家报纸指出，值得注意的是，侯赛尼集团是在美国国务卿杜勒斯发表他的露骨干涉印度尼西亚内政的谈话以后，立即向政府发出它的“最后通牒”的。在印度尼西亚进行的颠覆和分裂活动，显然是东南亚条约组织、荷兰以及美国的石油业大亨们的阴谋的具体化。
    “人民日报”还揭露，美国“钢铁行政”轮船公司在去年年底曾经运了四十三箱军火给中苏门答腊的叛乱集团“雄牛师委员会”。美国还在继续用军火来援助印度尼西亚的分裂分子。
    这家报纸说，在反对美国对印度尼西亚进行的干涉时，印度尼西亚政府和人民必须记取危地马拉的惨痛教训，避免发生“在前门赶走荷兰而在后门让美国挤进来”这样的事情。
    印度尼西亚民族通讯社今天揭露，几艘船名叫“顿吉里”、“特尔米纳”和“望加丽”的轮船曾经私运了一批批用盛水果的箱子装载的美国武器到中苏门答腊望加丽的杜迈地方。
    这家通讯社还揭露，最近有很多西方国家的人物伪装成传教士到了巴东，去协助侯赛尼训练武装人员使用新武器。这些人在训练军队的时候穿上高级军官的军服，平常穿着传教士的服装。
