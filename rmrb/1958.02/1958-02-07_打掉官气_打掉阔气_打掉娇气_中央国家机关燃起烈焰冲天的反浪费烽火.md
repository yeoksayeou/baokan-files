　　Eliminate Bureaucratic Airs, Eliminate Extravagance, Eliminate Sissy-ness
    Central State Organs Ignite a Raging Anti-Waste Beacon Fire

    The Central State Organs Party Committee held its 20th plenary meeting on the 5th, demanding that the central state organs take swift action and immediately launch a magnificent anti-waste movement across the board.

    The core of this movement is to oppose all forms of waste, eliminate bureaucratic airs, eliminate stagnation, eliminate extravagance, eliminate arrogance and sissy-ness, and implement the spirit of hard struggle and the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in all work.

    Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, gave instructions at the meeting on how the central state organs should carry out the anti-waste movement. Leaders from the Ministry of Culture and other departments also introduced the progress and experience of the anti-waste movement at the meeting.

    Not Only Calculate Economic Accounts but Also Ideological Accounts

    The current situation of the rectification movement in the central state organs is that the work of transferring cadres to lower levels has basically concluded, and the work of dealing with right-wing elements is about to conclude. The Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Food Industry, the Ministry of Urban Construction, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Nationalities Affairs Commission, the Meteorological Bureau, and eleven other units have either fully launched or partially launched the anti-waste movement in some departments and bureaus, and have gained preliminary experience in launching the anti-waste movement. The meeting believes that the conditions are now ripe for the central state organs to fully launch the anti-waste movement. The majority of units in the central state organs must use all methods to mobilize the masses and quickly launch the anti-waste movement in the ten days from now until the Spring Festival. A few units that cannot launch this movement before the Spring Festival must quickly catch up after the Spring Festival and end this movement by the end of February.

    The meeting believes that launching the anti-waste struggle is not merely an economic issue, but also a socialist political issue. Not only should we calculate economic accounts, but also ideological accounts. In this movement, after the masses are mobilized, they will inevitably come into contact with issues in all aspects of work, such as planning, design, capital construction, organizational structure, and use of human resources. All departments must wage a struggle against all forms of waste in all aspects of work, engage in major debates with all capitalist ideas that violate the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily, and once again conduct socialist education for all staff members of the central state organs. The person in charge of the Ministry of Culture pointed out in introducing their experience at the meeting that the anti-waste movement is essentially a struggle between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology. In this struggle, not only should we burn away all wasteful phenomena and implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, but also seize the central link of anti-waste, mobilize the power of the masses, start with specific problems, thoroughly examine ideological styles, overcome the three isms, oppose bourgeois professional thinking, and earnestly implement the Party's policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving socialism. The person in charge of the Ministry of Chemical Industry spoke at the meeting about how, in the special anti-waste debate on the standardized design of sulfuric acid factories, they not only found ways to save money, saving the country a lot of resources, but also found the ideological roots of wasteful phenomena such as blindly pursuing high standards and blindly pursuing mechanization and automation.

　　Leadership's Determination and Courage are the Key to the Anti-Waste Movement

    The meeting believes that the key to carrying out the anti-waste movement lies in the determination and courage of leading cadres. Leading cadres must overcome complacency, resolutely "burn themselves," and go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, and specifically lead the movement, in order to motivate the masses and launch the anti-waste movement in a magnificent way. Some unit leaders spoke at the meeting, using concrete examples to illustrate the great significance of the determination and courage of leading cadres in carrying out the anti-waste movement. The leading cadres of the Ministry of Culture were determined, energetic, and quick to act, leading the masses and quickly forming a hot trend of airing views and contending in the anti-waste campaign. More than 21,000 big-character posters were posted and more than 33,000 suggestions were made in ten days. The Second Ministry of Machine Building emphasized that in the anti-waste movement, the leading cadres of each unit should not only be in command but also personally take action; the five persons in charge of the Ministry of Chemical Industry separately grasped the five aspects of planning, design, capital construction, and production in the anti-waste movement, leading the masses to fiercely attack wasteful phenomena, and all achieved good results.

    The meeting believes that the anti-waste movement must be fully launched. Not only should industrial, financial, trade, cultural, and educational departments oppose waste, but the anti-waste movement should also be launched in political and legal departments and Party and League organs. These departments also have serious wasteful phenomena and are not "clean departments."

    The meeting studied the methods for carrying out the anti-waste movement. The meeting believes that the first step must be to mobilize the masses to post big-character posters and hold symposiums to comprehensively and fiercely expose various wasteful phenomena and form a climax of airing views and contending. The second step is to launch a major debate, determine right and wrong, find the causes of waste, and come up with ways to improve. The third step is to specifically improve the work. These three steps are not absolutely separated. For example, during the airing views and contending and debate process, as long as the cause of the waste is clarified and a way to improve it is found, it can be improved immediately. However, in the airing views stage, it is not appropriate to debate too early in order to avoid hindering the airing of views.

    Xi Zhongxun pointed out in his instructions that in order to deeply rectify, we must first launch an anti-waste movement. Especially in the central state organs, it is even more necessary to make the anti-waste campaign deep and thorough. This is because the central state organs are all leading organs. If the leading ideology is correct, the problem can be solved fundamentally, and the problem of "if the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked" can be prevented.

    Is it possible to quickly launch a massive anti-waste movement in the central state organs? Xi Zhongxun believes that the current situation is that everything is ready except for the east wind. As long as the leaders are not afraid of "burning themselves," are good at mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and strengthening specific leadership, they will definitely be able to launch the anti-waste movement. He said that the rectification movement in the central state organs has entered the stage of deep rectification, and the leading ideology must catch up, closely grasp the development of the movement, and promote the movement forward.

　　Since We Have Spent More Money, We Must Buy Back Lessons

    Xi Zhongxun pointed out that to carry out the anti-waste movement well, we must be good at grasping the essential problems that cause waste through the waste phenomena exposed; we must also be good at discovering ideological roots through specific examples. We must not only calculate small accounts, but also large accounts; we must not only calculate economic accounts, but also ideological accounts. He also said that in the anti-waste movement, we should not focus on investigating responsibility, but mainly learn lessons. Because we are engaged in a cause that predecessors have never done before, it is inevitable that many things cannot be done well at once. However, since we have spent more money, we must buy back lessons and understand where the mistake is, so that we can improve. Simply investigating responsibility is meaningless. Doing so is to conduct vivid socialist ideological education and can promote a further leap in everyone's ideological understanding.

    Xi Zhongxun emphasized that the center of anti-waste is: to oppose all waste phenomena; to eliminate bureaucratic airs, to eliminate stagnation, to eliminate extravagance, to eliminate arrogance and sissy-ness; to carry forward the revolutionary spirit, to promote revolutionary optimism and revolutionary heroism, and to implement the spirit of hard struggle, building the country diligently and thriftily, with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in all work.

    Xi Zhongxun believes that to carry out the anti-waste movement well, we must implement the working methods of the mass line: great airing of views, great contending, and great debate. We must fully mobilize the masses and carry out mass exposure, inspection, and evaluation activities. Holding anti-waste exhibitions and checking warehouses are all good methods. All units should promptly discover, support, and promote all good creations of the masses. Backward practices should be criticized and improved in a timely manner.

    Regarding the combination of anti-waste and improvement of work, Xi Zhongxun said that through the anti-waste movement, we must seize the revision of work plans and business plans, implement the spirit of anti-waste into practical actions, and do a good job of current and future work in the spirit of anti-waste.

　　Whether Deep Rectification Can Be Done Well is a Strict Test for Leaders

    Xi Zhongxun also said that whether the work in the stage of deep rectification can be done well and whether the deep rectification movement can be persisted in to the end is a strict test for leading cadres. If the leading work in this stage is not done well, it will affect the complete victory of the rectification movement, and it will be difficult to do a good job of normal business leadership. However, as long as the leading cadres are energetic, can study hard, and are willing to humbly learn from the masses, they will definitely be able to pass this test. The current leading work should be both comprehensive in taking care of unified arrangements and concentrated in breaking through one point; that is, both taking everything into consideration and fighting alone. This requires leading cadres to use their brains more and not simplify things. Attention should be paid to improving the leading ideology and improving the leading style in the movement.

    Xi Zhongxun finally said that when carrying out the anti-waste movement, we should also see the next step of work in order to make arrangements as early as possible. It now seems that after the anti-waste movement is basically over, we should promptly switch to discussions on issues such as institutional establishment, business policies, and work style according to the different conditions of each unit. Make the rectification movement of the central state organs advance step by step, and after holding the big watermelon of anti-waste, hold other big watermelons.

### 打掉官气　打掉阔气　打掉娇气  中央国家机关燃起烈焰冲天的反浪费烽火

　　打掉官气　打掉阔气　打掉娇气
    中央国家机关燃起烈焰冲天的反浪费烽火
    新华社6日讯　中央国家机关党委5日举行第二十次全体会议，要求中央国家机关迅速行动起来，立即全面地展开一个规模壮阔的反浪费运动。
    这个运动的中心是，反掉一切浪费现象，打掉官气，打掉暮气，打掉阔气，打掉骄气和娇气，把艰苦奋斗的精神和勤俭建国、多快好省的方针贯彻到一切工作中去。
    国务院秘书长习仲勋在会上对中央国家机关如何开展反浪费运动的问题作了指示。会上还有文化部等部门的负责人介绍了开展反浪费运动的情况和经验。
    不但要算经济账而且要算思想账
    中央国家机关当前整风运动的情况是，下放干部的工作已经基本结束，处理右派分子的工作即将基本结束。已经全面展开或在部分司局展开反浪费运动的有文化部、化学工业部、轻工业部、食品工业部、城市建设部、第二机械工业部、中国科学院、民族事务委员会、气象局等十一个单位，并且取得了展开反浪费运动的初步经验。会议认为，目前中央国家机关全面展开反浪费运动的条件已经成熟，中央国家机关的大多数单位，必须在从现在起到春节前的十天中，运用一切办法，发动群众，快马加鞭地展开反浪费运动。有少数单位如在春节以前不能展开这个运动，必须在春节以后迅速赶上，到2月底结束这一运动。
    会议认为，展开反浪费斗争绝不仅仅是经济上的问题，而且是社会主义的政治问题，不但要算经济账，而且要算思想账。在这个运动中，群众发动起来以后，一定会接触到工作中各个方面的问题，如计划、设计、基本建设、组织机构、人力使用等，各部门必须在工作中的各个方面同一切浪费现象展开斗争，同一切违背勤俭建国方针的资本主义思想进行大辩论，再一次地向中央国家机关的全体工作人员进行社会主义教育。文化部的负责人在会上介绍经验时指出，反浪费运动实质上是社会主义思想和资本主义思想的斗争。在这个斗争中，不但要烧掉一切浪费现象，贯彻勤俭建国方针，而且要抓住反浪费这一个中心环节，发动群众力量，由具体问题入手，深入检查思想作风，克服三个主义，反对资产阶级业务思想，认真贯彻执行党的文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的方针。化学工业部负责人在会上谈到了他们在硫酸工厂定型设计的反浪费专题辩论中，不仅找出了节约办法，给国家省下了大量资财，并且找出了盲目追求高标准，盲目追求机械化、自动化等产生浪费现象的思想根源。
　　领导的决心和勇气  是反浪费运动的关键
    会议认为，开展反浪费运动的关键在于领导干部的决心和勇气。领导干部必须克服自满情绪，坚决引火烧身，并且深入实际、深入群众、具体地领导运动，就能够带动群众，使反浪费运动波澜壮阔地开展起来。有些单位的负责人在发言中，以具体事例来说明领导干部的决心和勇气对于开展反浪费运动的重大意义。文化部领导干部决心大、劲头足、行动快，带动群众，很快就形成了反浪费的鸣放热潮，十天内共贴出了两万一千多张大字报，提出了三万三千多条意见。第二机械工业部强调在反浪费运动中各单位的领导干部不但要挂帅，还要亲自出马；化学工业部的五个负责人在反浪费运动中分别掌握计划、设计、基本建设、生产等五个方面的问题，领导群众，向浪费现象猛攻，收效都很好。
    会议认为，反浪费运动必须全面展开，不仅工业、财贸、文教等部门要反浪费，在政法部门、党团机关也要展开反浪费运动，这些部门也有严重的浪费现象，不是“清水衙门”。
    会议研究了开展反浪费运动的方法问题。会议认为第一步必须发动群众贴大字报、开座谈会，全面地、猛烈地揭露各种浪费现象，形成鸣放高潮。第二步是展开大辩论，判明是非，找出浪费的原因，想出改进的办法。第三步是具体改进工作。这三个步骤，并非绝对分开，如在鸣放、辩论过程中，只要弄清楚了浪费的原因，想出了改进办法，就可以立即改进。但是在鸣放阶段，不宜过早辩论，以免阻碍鸣放。
    习仲勋在指示中指出，深入整改，必须首先掀起一个反浪费运动。特别是中央国家机关，更需要把反浪费搞深搞透，这是因为中央国家机关都是领导机关，领导思想端正了，就可以从根本上解决问题，就可以防止“上梁不正下梁歪”的毛病。
    目前能不能够在中央国家机关内快马加鞭地掀起一个声势浩大的反浪费运动呢？习仲勋认为，目前的形势是一切具备，只欠东风。只要领导上不怕引火烧身，善于发动群众、依靠群众，加强具体领导，就一定能够把反浪费运动搞起来。他说，中央国家机关的整风运动已经进入了深入整改的阶段，领导思想必须赶上，紧紧掌握运动的发展情况，推动运动前进。
　　既然多花了钱就一定要买回教训来
    习仲勋指出，要搞好反浪费运动，必须善于通过揭发出来的浪费现象，抓住造成浪费的本质问题；还要善于通过具体事例，发掘思想根源。既要算小账，也要算大账；既要算经济账，也要算思想账。他又说，在反浪费运动中不着重追究责任，主要是吸取教训。因为我们正在从事前人没有做过的事业，许多事情不会做，一下子做不好是难免的。但是，既然多花了钱，就一定要买回教训来，懂得错在什么地方，以便改进，简单地追查责任是没有意义的。这样做，就是进行生动的社会主义思想教育，就能够促使大家的思想认识跃进一步。
    习仲勋强调指出，反浪费的中心是：反掉一切浪费现象；打掉官气，打掉暮气，打掉阔气，打掉骄气和娇气；发扬革命精神，提倡革命的乐观主义和革命的英雄主义，把艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国、多快好省的精神贯彻到一切工作中去。
    习仲勋认为，搞好反浪费运动，必须贯彻群众路线的工作方法：大鸣大放、大争大辩。必须充分发动群众，开展群众性的揭发、检查和评比活动。举行反浪费展览会，查仓库等办法都很好，各单位应该及时发现、支持并推广群众的一切好的创造。落后的做法要及时批判、改进。
    关于反浪费和改进工作相结合的问题，习仲勋说，通过反浪费运动，必须抓紧修订工作计划和业务计划，把反浪费的精神贯彻到实际行动中去，以反浪费的精神做好当前的和今后的工作。
　　能否做好深入整改对领导是个严格考验
    习仲勋还说，能否做好深入整改阶段的工作，能否把深入整风运动坚持到底，对领导干部来说是一个严格的考验。这一阶段的领导工作做不好，就影响整风运动的全胜，而平时的业务领导也很难做好。但是只要领导干部有干劲、能钻研、肯虚心向群众学习，就一定能够过好这一关。当前的领导工作应该是既要全面照顾统一安排，又要集中力量突破一点；也就是既要兼顾，又要单打一。这就要求领导干部多动脑筋，不能简单化。要注意在运动中提高领导思想，改进领导作风。
    习仲勋最后说，在开展反浪费运动时，还应该看到下一步工作，以便早作安排。现在看来，在反浪费运动基本结束以后，应按各单位的不同情况，及时转入对机构编制、业务方针、工作作风等问题的讨论。使中央国家机关的整风运动，一步步前进，在抱了反浪费的大西瓜以后，再抱别的大西瓜。
