Xinhua News Agency, February 15th:
The large-scale drought resistance struggle waged by the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has achieved a basic victory. According to a recent announcement by the Central Drought Resistance Committee of Vietnam, 90% of the drought-stricken cultivated land has been supplied with water. On the land that has been saved, strenuous efforts are currently being made to replant rice seedlings and to sow miscellaneous grains and cash crops. In the remaining approximately 24,000 Vietnamese acres (2.7 Vietnamese acres equals 1 hectare) of drought-stricken cultivated land, many Party and government cadres and military personnel are continuing to assist local farmers in their all-out efforts to rescue the crops. In order to strive for another bumper harvest of early crops this year in North Vietnam, which has already achieved several consecutive seasons of bumper harvests, the Vietnamese Party and government have called on the people in drought-stricken areas to seize the opportunity during and after the Spring Festival to work hard on drought resistance and replanting, and not to relax their efforts. The Vietnamese government recently also decided to vigorously promote well-drilling work throughout North Vietnam in order to ensure annual agricultural harvests.

Historically, Vietnam has suffered from droughts and floods of varying degrees every year. In North Vietnam, the harvest in every ten-year period is generally three years of bumper harvests, three years of poor harvests, and four years of average harvests. Since the restoration of peace, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has led the people in vigorously constructing water conservancy projects to prevent floods and resist droughts. As a result, since the autumn of 1955, it has achieved bumper agricultural harvests for five consecutive seasons.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 15th: Saigon News: According to reports in Saigon's "Times," "Morning Post," "Freedom News" and other newspapers, South Vietnam has suffered severe droughts and typhoons since last autumn, and crops have suffered heavy losses, causing hardship for the vast number of farmers.

The drought-stricken areas include all provinces in the southernmost part of Vietnam (the former Cochinchina region), and the losses of autumn crops in each province range from 30% to 80%. The most severely affected areas are the central and western provinces of the south. Some provinces suffered from floods or insect plagues before the drought.

Since the restoration of peace, the South Vietnamese regime has never constructed any water conservancy projects. After this severe drought and typhoon occurred, the South Vietnamese regime did not provide disaster relief. On the contrary, it continued to intensify its efforts to force farmers to sell their crops to it at prices 30% lower than market prices. After this severe crop failure, the South Vietnamese authorities still decided to export 250,000 tons of rice this year, an increase of 50,000 tons over last year.

According to the "Morning Post," the vast number of farmers in South Vietnam have already demanded that the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities reduce rent and taxes, appropriately increase the purchase price of grain, and supply food to disaster areas.

    任何灾患吓不倒英雄的人民
    越南抗旱斗争取得基本胜利
    南越农作物受灾农民困难而吴庭艳政权仍横征暴敛
    据新华社15日讯　越南民主共和国人民进行的规模宏大的一次抗旱斗争已经取得基本的胜利。据越南中央抗旱委员会最近宣布，受旱耕地已经有90％得到了水。在被挽救了的土地上，目前正在紧张地进行补秧、补种杂粮和经济作物的工作。在其余约二万四千越亩（二点七越亩合一公顷）的受旱耕地上，许多党政干部和部队人员正在继续协助当地农民全力进行抢救。为了争取使已经接连获得几季丰收的越南北部再次取得今年早造的丰收，越南党和政府号召受旱地区的人民在春节前后抓紧时机进行抗旱和补种的工作，不要松劲。越南政府最近还决定了在越南北部全境大力推广打井工作，以便保证农业的年年丰收。
    越南历史上每年都遭受程度不同的旱灾和涝灾，越南北部的收成每十年一般为三丰年、三歉年、四平年。和平恢复以来，越南民主共和国政府领导人民大力兴修水利，防涝抗旱，因而从1955年秋季以来，接连五季取得了农业的丰收。
    新华社河内15日电　西贡消息：据西贡“时论报”、“晨报”、“自由报”和其它一些报纸报道，南越去年秋季以来，遭受严重的旱灾和风灾，农作物损失惨重，广大农民的生活已经发生困难。
    旱灾的地区包括南越最富饶的南部（前交趾支那地区）的各个省份，各省秋季作物的损失从30％到80％不等。旱情最重的是南部的中部和西部各省。有的省份在受旱以前还受了涝灾或虫灾。
    和平恢复以来，南越政权从未兴修过水利，在这次严重的旱情和风灾发生以后，南越政权见灾不救，相反地，仍然加紧强迫农民以低于市价30％以上的价格把农作物卖给它。经过这次粮食的严重失收之后，南越当局仍然决定在今年出口大米二十五万吨，比去年增加五万吨。
    据“晨报”报道，南越广大农民已经向吴庭艳当局提出减租减税、适当提高收购谷物价格和供应灾区粮食等要求。
