Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 31st – The results of promoting double-wheel double-share plows in Zhejiang Province over the past few years have proven the superiority of these plows in improving agricultural production. In many areas where double-share plowing has led to increased yields, the masses praise the double-wheel double-share plow with names like "yield-increasing plow," "benefit-creating plow," and "small tractor."

When Zhejiang Province began promoting double-wheel double-share plows, some people always thought that "double-wheel double-share plows are good for plowing dry land, but difficult to use in paddy fields," "easy to use in sandy soil, but difficult to use in clay soil," "southern fields are small, and plowing at the ends and edges of the fields is impossible," "one cow can't pull it, and two cows will fight," and so on. Now facts have proven that these statements are unfounded. The results of double-share plow farming experiments conducted by nearly two hundred production units in Zhejiang Province show that under the same conditions, the yield of various crops (including rice, wheat, rapeseed, cotton, etc.) cultivated with this plow increased by more than 10% compared with those cultivated with traditional plows. Whether it is in the plains or mountainous and semi-mountainous flat areas, dry land or paddy fields, sandy soil or clay soil areas, the double-wheel double-share plow is suitable for use. In Jiashan County in the Hangjiahu water network area, all 540,000 mu of paddy fields are clay soil. The more than 700 double-wheel double-share plows promoted throughout the county were basically put into production last year. According to the results of experiments conducted by two agricultural cooperatives in Tianren Township of this county, using double-share plows to cultivate rice increased the yield by more than 40 to 70 jin per mu. Jiaxing County is a key area for experimenting with double-wheel double-share plows for plowing paddy fields. Experiments have proved that as long as the original double-wheel double-share plow is slightly modified, it can be used in green manure fields, spring flower ridge fields, first-crop dry fields, and second-crop irrigated fields in paddy fields. In order to achieve a grain yield of 800 jin per mu ahead of schedule, Fengzhen Agricultural Cooperative in Wangdian Township of this county is preparing to use double-wheel double-share plows to cultivate all of its more than 2,300 mu of land this year.

Huangyan County, which belongs to the hilly area, has poorer natural conditions than the Hangjiahu Plain. Most of the paddy fields here are clay soil, and the fields are relatively small. The yellow cattle used for plowing are also small in size. However, Huangyan County made a typical demonstration when promoting double-share plows and trained a large number of skilled users of double-share plows. Last year, more than 50,000 mu of land were plowed with double-share plows during spring plowing throughout the county. In Jiaokeng Township, a semi-mountainous area of this county, the terrain is not flat, and the largest fields are only three to five mu in size, but there are more than 100 double-share plows in use in this township, all pulled by yellow cattle, and the increase in production is significant. The First Agricultural Cooperative of this township conducted three consecutive comparative experiments. The total yield of rice and wheat cultivated with double-share plows in three seasons increased by 25.5% compared with those cultivated with traditional plows.

Through experiments in various parts of Zhejiang, the efficiency and quality of double-wheel double-share plow cultivation are much higher than that of traditional plows. A double-share plow can cultivate more than eight to ten mu of land per day, while a traditional plow can only cultivate three or four mu. The results of experiments in Yongjia County show that the pulling force of double-share plows is 11% to 33% lighter than that of traditional plows. It is easy and labor-saving to plow the fields with double-share plows, and there is no need to hold the plow. You only need to lift the plow and insert the plow when turning. Some people say: In the past, we followed behind holding the plow (traditional plow), now we follow behind (double-share plow), and in the future, we will sit and drive (tractor). The soil plowed by double-share plows is half an inch to an inch deeper than that plowed by traditional plows, thus improving the soil.

In many places in Zhejiang Province, double-share plows are also used to remove rice roots, reclaim wasteland, and remove sod to accumulate fertilizer. Local people call double-share plows "omnipotent plows."

### 双轮双铧犁成了“增产犁”  浙江农民交口称赞

　　双轮双铧犁成了“增产犁”
    浙江农民交口称赞
    新华社杭州31日电　浙江省几年来推广双轮双铧犁的结果，证明双轮双铧犁在提高农业生产方面发挥了优越性。许多用双铧犁耕作而得到增产的地区，群众用“增产犁”、“造福犁”、“小拖拉机”的称呼来赞扬双轮双铧犁。
    浙江省在开始推广双轮双铧犁的时候，有人总认为“双轮双铧犁旱地好耕，水田难行”，“砂壤土好使，粘壤土难用”，“南方田块小，田头田边犁不到”，“一头牛拉不动，两头牛要打架”等等。现在事实证明，这些说法是没有根据的。浙江省近二百个生产单位进行双铧犁耕作试验的结果表明：在同样条件下，用这种犁耕作的各种作物（包括水稻、麦子、油菜、棉花等）产量比用土犁耕作增产一成以上；无论平原或山区和半山区的平坦地，旱地或水田，砂壤土或粘壤土地区，都适于使用双轮双铧犁。杭嘉湖水网地区的嘉善县，五十四万亩水田全是粘壤土，全县推广的七百多部双轮双铧犁，在去年都基本投入生产。据这个县天壬乡两个农业社的试验结果，用双铧犁耕田，每亩水稻增产四十斤到七十斤以上。嘉兴县是试验双轮双铧犁耕水田的重点地区。试验证明，只要对原型双轮双铧犁稍加改装，就无论在水田中的绿肥田、春花畦田、头番干田和二番灌水田中，都可以使用。这个县的王店乡风珍农业社，为了提前实现亩产粮食八百斤，今年全社的二千三百多亩地都准备用双轮双铧犁来耕作。
    属于丘陵地带的黄岩县，自然条件比杭嘉湖平原差，这里的水田大都是粘壤土，并且田块较小，用来耕田的黄牛体型很小。但是黄岩县在推广双铧犁时作了典型示范，训练了大批使用双铧犁的能手，去年全县春耕中就用双铧犁耕了五万多亩地。这个县半山区的焦坑乡，地势并不平坦，田块最大也只有三亩到五亩那样大，可是这个乡使用的双铧犁就有一百多部，全部用黄牛拉，增产显著。这个乡第一农业社进行三次连续试验对比，用双铧犁耕作的水稻、麦子，三季产量合计比用土犁耕的增产25.5％。
    浙江各地经过试验，双轮双铧犁耕作的效率和质量比土犁要高得多。一部双铧犁每天能耕田八亩到十亩以上，而土犁只能耕三、四亩。永嘉县的试验结果说明，双铧犁比土犁的拉力轻11％到33％。用双铧犁耕田轻便省力，不需要扶犁，在转弯时起犁、插犁就可以了。有的群众说：从前扶着走（土犁），现在跟着走（双铧犁），将来坐着走（拖拉机）。双铧犁耕的地比土犁耕的要深半寸到一寸以上，因此也改良了土壤。
    浙江省有许多地方还用双铧犁铲稻根、垦荒和铲草皮积肥，当地群众把双铧犁叫做“万能犁”。
