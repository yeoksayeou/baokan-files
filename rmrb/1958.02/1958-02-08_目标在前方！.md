　　The Goal is Ahead!
　　He Ming
    When a person has drive, it's called having "vitality." I think using vitality to explain drive not only refers to getting up early in the morning, because resting overnight dispels fatigue, but more importantly: getting up early in the morning means there are many things waiting to be done. If you are not a lazy person, seeing so many things to do will give you drive. Lazy people only get out of bed after the sun is high in the sky. Logically speaking, they should have rested enough and have energy, but they don't have any vitality at all. The reason is that, in their eyes, there is nothing to do. Eat twice and then sleep – that's their whole career, so they only have a sense of decline.
    We are engaged in revolutionary work and extremely despise lazy people. However, sometimes some people also get a touch of this sense of decline, lacking drive or having less drive. Can you say that their communist worldview has not yet been established? Not necessarily. Some of them even know that socialist revolution is not the ultimate goal, but to advance society to communism. So, why do they also lack drive or have less drive? I think one of the reasons is: looking backward, excessively indulging in admiring the achievements already made.
    Great achievements are the foundation for continued progress. However, it can inspire people's vitality, and it can also make people feel a sense of decline, depending on how you treat it. If you are always admiring past achievements from morning to night, dancing and singing about it, and if dancing and singing is not enough then you start to praise it, then you will lose sight of the goal ahead, to the point where your mind goes numb, and you fall asleep on your achievements without realizing it.
    Life is like the raging waves of the sea, wave after wave, the front wave pushing the back wave, always moving forward, never stopping. If we want to stand still, treading water, we will be left behind by life. The life of a revolutionary should also be like the endless flowing water in the sea. Looking forward, climb one mountain, then immediately climb another higher mountain; is it already very high? Yes. But, "there is always a sky beyond the sky."
    We must see the great achievements, and also see some shortcomings or mistakes. But, the goal is ahead! Reviewing achievements is to advance towards higher goals on the basis of the achievements already made, to see the favorable conditions, to boost confidence and courage, and reviewing shortcomings and mistakes is to correct them, to learn from experiences and lessons to do future work better.
    The goal is ahead!—Not only to have great ideals, but also to see the new demands put forward by life in every step, and to see the specific goals of progress. One goal, then another higher goal, then another even higher goal... It is ahead, we have not yet reached it, for the benefit of the people and the cause of communism, we must reach it, and we will definitely be able to reach it, and then the drive will come; pride will have no place to hide.
    Shouldn't we sing the praises of our great achievements? We should sing praises, and we should sing praises greatly. But, the goal is ahead! The movement of praise should become a bugle call for the march towards socialism and communism, not a lullaby.

### 目标在前方！

　　目标在前方！
　　何明
    一个人有劲头，叫作有“朝气”。用朝气说明劲头，我想，不仅是说清晨起来，因为休息了一夜赶走了疲困，而且更重要的是：清晨起来，有许多事等着要做，如果不是懒汉，看到那么多的事要做，劲头就来了。懒汉睡到日上三竿才起床，照理说是休息够了，该有精力了，但是他们却没有一点儿朝气，原因就是，在他们眼中看来是无事可做的。两饱一倒，这就是他们的全部事业，所以他们只有暮气。
    我们是干革命事业的，是极端卑视懒汉的。但是，有的人有时候也会染上一种暮气，没有干劲了或是干劲不大了。你说他们的共产主义人生观还没有树立吗？也不见得。其中有些人，倒是晓得社会主义革命还不是最终目的，而要把社会推进到共产主义去的。那么，为什么也会没有干劲或是干劲不大了呢？我想，原因之一就是：眼睛向后看，过分陶醉于欣赏已经达到的成就。
    伟大的成就，是继续前进的基础。但是，它可以鼓舞人们的朝气，也可以使人因而产生暮气，这就要看是怎样对待它了。如果自早到晚老是欣赏过去的成就，舞之，蹈之，舞之蹈之不足而咏叹之，那么，就会失掉前方的目标，以至头脑发木，躺在成绩上睡觉而不自觉。
    生活犹如大海的怒涛，一浪接一浪，前浪推后浪，是永远向前，永无止息的。我们如果要立定，在原地踏步，就要被生活抛在后面。革命者的生活，也要像永不停息的大海里的流水。眼睛向前看，翻上了一个山头，紧接着就翻另一个更高的山头；它已经很高了吗？是的。但是，“天外还有天”。
    我们既要看到巨大的成绩，也要看到某些缺点或错误。但是，目标在前方！检阅成绩是为了在已达到的成就基础上向更高的目标前进，看清有利条件，鼓足信心和勇气，检讨缺点、错误是为了改正，汲取经验教训把今后的工作做得更好。
    目标在前方！——不仅是要有伟大的理想，而且，每一步都要看到生活提出的新要求，都要看到前进的具体目标。一个目标，又一个较高的目标，又一个更高的目标……。它在前边，我们还没有达到，为了人民的利益、共产主义事业一定要达到，而且也一定能够达到，于是干劲就来了；骄傲也就没有藏身之所了。
    难道不应该歌颂我们的伟大成就吗？要歌颂的，而且要大大的歌颂的。但是，目标在前方！歌颂的乐章，要成为向社会主义和共产主义的进军号，而不要成为催眠曲。
