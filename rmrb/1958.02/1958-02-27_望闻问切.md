    Observation, Auscultation, Olfaction, Interrogation, and Palpation
    Zhu Yan
    Observation, auscultation, olfaction, interrogation, and palpation are the four main diagnostic methods of traditional Chinese medicine.
    Legend has it that during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the famous doctor Bian Que could see the root causes of diseases in people's five internal organs through observation. Once, he went to the State of Qi, and upon seeing the countenance of Duke Huan of Qi, who came to receive him, he knew that Duke Huan was ill and predicted that the illness would worsen, urging Duke Huan to seek treatment as soon as possible. However, Duke Huan was unaware of his illness and did not heed his advice. Some days later, Bian Que met with Duke Huan again and saw that the latter's illness was already difficult to treat, so he left without saying goodbye. Duke Huan eventually died of the illness (see *Records of the Grand Historian: Biography of Bian Que*). Although this is a story, it is enough to show that Chinese medicine had already invented the method of diagnosing diseases by observing a patient's appearance and spirit about 2,500 years ago. This is observation. Later, the content of observation became even richer, including the patient's complexion, expression, mental state, eyebrows, eyes, hair, skin color, posture, build, height, nutritional status, as well as the tongue, tongue coating, stool, urine, phlegm, etc., all within the scope of the doctor's observation.
    Observation is one of the effective methods for diagnosing diseases. Because illness will manifest symptoms, just as ideological problems will be exposed sooner or later. As the saying goes, "What is inside must manifest on the outside." Therefore, some experienced elderly women, seeing children with watery eyes and red spots on their faces, know that it is measles; seeing children with sunken eye sockets (a sign of dehydration), they can also tell that it is diarrhea. Ordinary people can also see the severity of the illness from phenomena such as "skin and bones" and "a face full of illness." I remember that after Cao Xueqin described Lin Daiyu's symptoms of coughing, spitting blood, and shortness of breath, which were symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, he also wrote: "Grandmother Jia saw that Daiyu's spirit was not good, so she came out and told Sister Feng and the others, 'I see that this child's illness, I don't mean to curse her, but I'm afraid it will be difficult to get better'" (see *Dream of the Red Chamber*, Chapter 97). From this description, regardless of Grandmother Jia's character and other things, just from the point of observation, Grandmother Jia was indeed experienced. Observation is looking, and people asking doctors to treat illnesses is often called asking doctors to "look" at the illness, probably stemming from the meaning of observation.
    Observation can indeed "know the internal from the external" and "observe its external responses to know its internal organs" (see *Huangdi Neijing*), but it is also easy to be deceived by false appearances. The inside and outside of many things (including being sick) are often inconsistent. Some patients are outwardly strong but inwardly weak, with illness inside but a seemingly good exterior. Like bad oranges, they are gold and jade on the outside but rotten straw on the inside. Therefore, diagnosing an illness must be combined with auscultation, olfaction, interrogation, palpation, and other diagnostic methods for a comprehensive analysis.
    Auscultation is discerning the patient's sounds, including groaning, coughing, wheezing, intestinal sounds, flatus (i.e., farting), hiccuping, etc. The doctor knows that a loud voice indicates excess, a weak voice indicates deficiency, a violent cough with a turbid sound and much phlegm indicates wind-cold, a prolonged cough without phlegm and a hoarse voice indicates pulmonary tuberculosis, screaming indicates much pain, delirium indicates much heat, and so on.
    Interrogation is exploring the patient's feelings and related matters before and after the onset of the illness, such as the date of onset, diet, living environment, and lifestyle habits. Ancient medical books had already proposed: "When approaching a patient, ask about their bowel movements," "When dealing with a sick person, ask about their condition frequently," "Diagnosing a disease without asking about its origin, worries about dietary indiscretions, excesses in daily life, or harm from toxins, if you don't mention this first and immediately feel the pulse (i.e., busy palpating the pulse), how can you accurately diagnose the disease" (all from *Huangdi Neijing*). In later generations, the questions became more and more thorough. Zhang Jingyue, a famous doctor in the Ming Dynasty, once summarized the essential items to be asked into "Ten Questions"; Li Ting's *Introduction to Medicine* in the Ming Dynasty recorded "Sixty Questions for Diagnosing Diseases."
    Palpation is feeling the pulse, mainly to distinguish the speed, strength, depth, thickness, and evenness of the pulse. Several main pulse conditions are: floating pulse, indicating external syndromes; deep pulse, indicating internal syndromes; slow pulse (beating slowly), indicating obstructed syndromes; rapid pulse (beating quickly), indicating cold syndromes; hurried pulse, bound pulse, and intermittent pulse are all intermittent pulses, all indicating critical conditions. In ancient times, many parts of the body were used for pulse diagnosis; the head and feet had to be felt. Later, only the radial artery at the wrist was used. The doctor uses three fingers to press on the pulse at this point, calling them the cun pulse, guan pulse, and chi pulse in order from the end closest to the palm. Generally speaking, the cun pulse governs diseases of the upper body, the guan pulse governs diseases of the middle body, and the chi pulse governs diseases of the lower body.
    Modern diagnostics also includes pulse palpation, mainly to count the pulse rate, see if the beat is even, and feel the size, strength, and elasticity of the pulse. Compared to this, it seems that the pulse palpation of traditional Chinese medicine is more detailed. As early as in Zhang Zhongjing's *Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases* in the Han Dynasty, various pulse conditions such as "floating, large, rapid, moving, slippery, deep, hesitant, thin, weak, wiry, faint, slow, hurried, bound, and intermittent" were recorded. Wang Shuhe of the Jin Dynasty collected even more materials and wrote a *Pulse Classic*, which explained them in more detail.
    Observation, auscultation, olfaction, interrogation, and palpation are a complete set of diagnostic methods in traditional Chinese medicine, and they should be combined to accurately determine the condition, guide treatment, and predict prognosis. The *Huangdi Neijing* had already said: "A good diagnostician observes the complexion and palpates the pulse, first distinguishing yin and yang, examining the clarity and turbidity to know the body regions, observing breathing and listening to sounds to know the suffering, observing the balance and standards to know the location of the disease, and palpating the cun, guan, and chi, and observing floating, deep, slippery, and hesitant to know the cause of the disease."
    In my opinion, these four methods are not only methods for diagnosing diseases but can also be used as methods for examining a person's ideological essence.

    望闻问切
    朱颜
    望、闻、问、切，是中医看病的四种主要的诊断方法。
    相传在春秋战国时期，名医扁鹊能望见人的五脏症结。有一次，他到齐国去，一见前来接待他的齐桓侯的神色，就知道齐桓侯有病，而且预测病势将日趋严重，叫齐桓侯及早医治。但齐桓侯还不自知有病，没有听信他的劝告。过了些日子，扁鹊又和齐桓侯见面，看出后者的疾病已经难治了，因而望而退走，齐桓侯也终于病死（见史记扁鹊传）。这虽然是个故事，但也足以说明祖国医学在距今约二千五百年前就发明了看望病人形色和神气来诊病的方法，这就是望，到了后来，望的内容更加丰富了，病人的面色、表情、神志、眉眼、毛发、皮色、姿态、肥瘦、高矮、营养状况，以及舌头、舌苔、大便、小便、痰唾等等，都在大夫望的范围里了。
    望是诊断病情的有效方法之一。因为有病就会有病像现出来，正如有思想问题迟早会暴露出来一样。常言说得好，“有诸内，必形诸外”。所以有些有经验的老大娘，看见孩子眼睛水汪汪、脸上出现红点子，也知道是出麻疹；看见孩子眼眶眶陷下去（是一种脱水的病像），也可以知道是泻肚子。一般人也都可以从“骨瘦如柴”、“病容满面”等现象看出病情的严重程度。记得曹雪芹在描写林黛玉咳嗽、吐血、气喘等肺痨症状之后，还这样写：“贾母看黛玉神气不好，便出来告诉凤姐等道：我看这孩子的病，不是我咒她，只怕难好”（见红楼梦第九十七回）。从这段描写里，姑不论贾母的为人及其他，单从望这点来说，贾母确是有经验的了。望就是看，人们请大夫医病，常常叫请大夫看病，恐怕就是来自望的意思。
    望，果然可以“以表知里”“视其外应，以知其内脏”（见黄帝内经），但也容易被假象骗过。许多事物（包括生病在内）的表里往往不一致。有些病人外强中干，里头有病，外表似乎很好。就好像坏橘子似的，金玉其外，败絮其中。所以诊断病情还须结合闻、问、切等诊法加以全面分析。
    闻就是辨听病人的声音，呻吟、咳嗽、气喘、肠鸣、矢气（即放屁）、呃逆（即打呃）等等，都在其内。大夫知道，声音洪亮为实，声音微弱为虚，暴咳声浊多痰为风寒，久咳无痰声嘶属肺痨，惊呼多痛，谵语多热，等等。
    问就是探问病人的感觉和发病前后的有关事项，如起病时日、饮食、居处和生活习惯等等。古代医书中早就提出：“临病人，问所便”、“系之病者，数问其情”、“诊病不问其始，忧患饮食之失节，起居之过度，或伤于毒，不先言此，卒持寸口（即忙于切脉），何病能中”（均见黄帝内经）。到后世，越问越周到，明代名医张景岳曾经把必问的项目归纳成“十问”；明代李廷的“医学入门”则记述了“诊病六十问”。
    切就是切脉，主要是辨别脉搏的快慢、强弱、深浅、粗细、匀不匀等状况。几种主要的脉象，如浮脉，主表症；沉脉，主里症；迟脉（跳得慢），主塞症；数脉（跳得快），主寒症；促脉、结脉、代脉，都是间歇的脉，均主危症。古代切脉的部位很多，头上脚上都要切，后来只取手腕部的挠骨动脉处来切。大夫用三个手指头按这处的脉搏，靠从近手掌这端起，依顺序叫做寸脉、关脉、尺脉。一般说，寸脉主上身的病，关脉主中部的病，尺脉主下身的病。
    现代诊断学中也有切脉一项，主要是数一数脉搏的次数，看搏动匀不匀，触知脉搏的大小、强度和弹性等。比起来，似乎还是中医的切脉更精细些。远在汉代张仲景的“伤寒论”里，就已记载了“浮、大、数、动、滑、沉、濇、细、弱、弦、微、迟、促、结、代”等各种脉象。晋代王叔和更搜集了许多材料，写成一部“脉经”，讲得更详细。
    望、闻、问、切是祖国医学诊断方法的一个整套，应该结合起来，才可能准确的判断病情、指导治疗和推测预后。黄帝内经早说过：“善诊者察色按脉，先别阴阳，审清浊而知部分，视喘息、听声音而知所苦，观权衡规矩而知病所主，按尺寸、观浮沉滑濇而知病所生”。
    我看，这四种不仅是诊断疾病的方法，也可以作为考察一个人的思想本质的方法。
