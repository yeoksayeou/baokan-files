Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 8th: The First Automobile Works has initially determined to produce 2,000 sets of gas engines and 620 sets of combine engines this year to support the great leap forward in agricultural production.

　　The design drawings for the 35-horsepower gas engine have been completed, and 1,000 units can be produced by the end of April. The combine engine will first deliver 300 units by the end of March to meet the needs of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory for the production of combine harvesters.

　　In order to be fully responsible to the peasants, the factory recently invited units from Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shandong, and other places that ordered gas engines to a forum to understand user opinions and actual needs, introduce equipment performance and maintenance methods to users, and assist users in solving specific problems. For the convenience of users' repairs, the factory also provides each machine with a batch of more than 60 kinds of easily damaged spare parts and a complete set of repair tools, which are brought to the countryside with the machines. Recently, the factory has also selected more than 800 employees for training, preparing to go to the countryside with the machines to help with installation and train operators and repairmen for the countryside.

　　第一汽车厂为农村生产动力机械
    据新华社长春8日电　第一汽车制造厂今年初步确定生产两千台煤气发动机和六百二十台康拜因发动机，支援农业生产大跃进。
    三十五马力煤气机的设计图纸已经全部完成，在4月底就可以生产出一千台。康拜因发动机将在3月底先交出三百台，以配合北京农业机械厂生产联合收割机的需要。
    这个厂为了对农民负责到底，最近专门邀请吉林、辽宁、内蒙古、河北、山东等地订购煤气机的单位进行座谈，了解用户意见和实际需要，向用户介绍设备性能，保养方法，协助用户解决具体问题。为了用户修理便利，这个厂还专门供给每机一批六十多种易损备件和全套修理工具，随机带到农村。最近，厂里又抽出八百多名职工进行训练，准备随机下乡帮助安装，为农村培养操作手和修理工。
