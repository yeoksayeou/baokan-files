Small Common Sense

　　Don't Pick Your Nose
　　There are many small hairs growing in the nostrils, which act like a filter, blocking dust, bacteria, small insects and other debris in the air. Over time, the debris adhering to the nasal hair forms black clumps, which are nasal mucus.
    How to remove nasal mucus?
    When washing your face, first wash your hands clean, then wash your nostrils with clean water, and finally gently blow your nose to clean it.
    But many people are accustomed to picking their nose with their hands anytime and anywhere, which is not good. You should know that picking your nose with your hands can easily cause minor scratches. Hands are dirty, and the nostrils are also dirty. Bacteria from both sides are likely to enter the scratches. Maybe you don't feel anything at first, and you can't see it with your eyes, but the disease has already been planted. Mild cases cause redness, swelling, pain, and suppuration. Severe cases swell severely, causing fever and headache. Moreover, the condition may spread along the rich blood vessels on the face to the brain, which is medically called cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis, and that situation would be serious.
    Maybe someone will say, I always pick my nose and nothing happens? Yes, it doesn't necessarily cause problems every time, but overall, the chances of problems are much higher than those who don't pick their nose. Don't you believe it? In our hospital, there are many patients with this type of nasal disease.

### 不要挖鼻孔

　　不要挖鼻孔
    鼻孔里长着很多小毛，作用同过滤器一样，能挡住空气中的尘土、细菌、小虫子等杂物。时间一长，黏附在鼻毛上的杂物结成一块块黑块，就是鼻屎。
    怎样清除鼻屎呢？
    洗脸的时候，首先把手洗干净，然后再用清水洗一下鼻孔，最后再轻轻的擤出鼻涕，就干净了。
    但是有很多人习惯于随时随地用手挖鼻孔，这不好。要知道用手挖鼻孔很容易造成轻微的抓伤。手是不干净的，鼻孔里也脏，来自这两方面的细菌很可能进入抓伤处。也许开始自己也没有什么感觉，用眼睛也看不出来，可是却已种下了病。轻的引起红肿、疼痛和化脓。重的肿得厉害，全身发烧和头痛。而且病情还可能沿着脸上很丰富的血管，扩展到脑子里医学上叫做海绵静脉窦炎，那样情况就严重了。
    也许有人说，我老挖鼻孔也没出毛病呀？是的，不是每一次必定出毛病，但总起来说，出毛病的机会比不挖鼻孔的人多得多。你不信吗？在我们医院里，就不少这类鼻病患者。
