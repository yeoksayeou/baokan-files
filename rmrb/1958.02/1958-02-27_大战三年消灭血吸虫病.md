Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 26th: The Fourth National Conference on Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control, held in Shanghai, issued a battle call to the commanders and fighters across the country engaged in eliminating schistosomiasis: "Go all out, advance in all aspects, fight hard for three years, and accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis!"

The representatives from various provinces and cities attending the conference believed that a great leap forward in schistosomiasis prevention and control was entirely possible. They resolved to wage a great war against schistosomiasis with a tenacious revolutionary fighting spirit. The representatives stated that within 1958, schistosomiasis would be basically eliminated in one-third of the schistosomiasis-endemic areas nationwide.

According to the materials presented at the conference, last year, various localities, in conjunction with water conservancy construction, launched a massive schistosomiasis prevention and control campaign. Thirteen counties and cities and two suburban districts across the country have emerged as basically free from schistosomiasis. These counties and cities are: Yujiang, Wuyuan, Shangyou, Fengxin, and Fuliang in Jiangxi Province; Gucheng, Xiangyang, and Daye in Hubei Province; Cili in Hunan Province; Qimen and Taiping in Anhui Province; Deqing and Shaoxing (city) in Zhejiang Province; and the northern and eastern suburbs of Shanghai. Various localities have also basically eliminated the intermediate host of schistosomiasis, the Oncomelania snail, in 343 townships. In the past year, 500,000 patients nationwide were treated, including approximately 100,000 patients with advanced-stage schistosomiasis.

In summarizing past achievements and experiences, the conference drew two undeniable conclusions. First, although the number of areas that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis is still small, what these dozen or so counties and cities can do, other areas can certainly do as well. The experience of these dozen or so counties and cities powerfully proves that we can overcome the serious harm schistosomiasis poses to the people. Second, the working experience of these areas that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis proves that relying on the masses, implementing an active prevention and control policy, and adopting comprehensive measures tailored to local conditions and specific times are correct. Attempting to negate the active prevention and control policy, one-sidedly emphasizing that only one aspect, such as fecal management, snail elimination, or patient treatment, is sufficient, and opposing comprehensive measures will inevitably lead to failure in completing the task of eliminating schistosomiasis. Shanghai, with its most excellent technical team, fell behind last year because some cadres and technicians were arrogant, complacent, and right-leaning, were not enthusiastic about new inventions and creations, and were particularly influenced by the idea of "snail elimination as the primary focus." Patient treatment only completed 30% of last year's plan, making it a backward area. The conference pointed out that the attitude taken towards the active prevention and control policy and comprehensive measures tailored to local conditions and specific times is a reflection of the struggle between two lines in schistosomiasis prevention and control work. Only by criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking and embarking on the path of active prevention and control can we achieve a comprehensive leap forward in schistosomiasis prevention and control work.

Representatives from various localities exchanged work experiences at the meeting and also conducted serious self-criticisms of the mistakes and shortcomings in their work. The representatives unanimously expressed their determination to diligently implement the active prevention and control policy, mobilize the broad masses, combine snail elimination with farmland water conservancy construction and other effective measures, combine fertilizer accumulation and the elimination of the four pests with fecal management and the killing of schistosomiasis eggs, and at the same time actively promote the antimony agent three-day treatment method, promote mobile treatment in communes, outpatient treatment, and other methods to facilitate the masses, treat more patients, and accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis. Yunnan Province, where prevention and control work started relatively late, is determined to fight hard for two years and complete the final stage in one year, catching up with the advanced within one year. Shanghai is determined to treat all treatable patients this year and complete the full treatment task for Jiading, Baoshan, and Shanghai counties. At the meeting, representatives from Anhui, Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Shanghai challenged Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Fujian to achieve their schistosomiasis elimination plans ahead of schedule. Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Shanghai proposed to fight hard for one year and use one year or more to complete the final stage, basically eliminating schistosomiasis. Hunan, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces proposed to fight hard for two years and use one to two years or more to complete the final stage, basically eliminating schistosomiasis. Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei provinces proposed to fight hard for three years and use one to two years or more to complete the final stage, basically eliminating schistosomiasis.

Representatives from all provinces and cities also put forward prevention and control plans and guarantee measures for 1958 at the meeting. This year, more than one hundred counties and cities are required to achieve basic elimination of schistosomiasis, and it is required to treat 20% to 30% of all patients.

This meeting was held from February 10th to 13th, with the participation of more than eighty representatives, scientists, and doctors from twelve provinces and cities. Representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources also attended.

At the meeting, Ke Qingshi and Wei Wenbo, heads of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's nine-member leading group for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis, made reports and instructions successively.

Various agricultural cooperatives have adopted many methods to eliminate Oncomelania snails; and do a good job in fecal management and drinking water management for humans and animals. This is the drinking water pond of the League Cooperative, no one is allowed to wash clothes, wash vegetables, or let livestock drink water here.

### 大战三年消灭血吸虫病

    全国防治血吸虫病工作会议发出战斗号召
    大战三年消灭血吸虫病
    必须反掉保守思想，采取综合措施，进行积极防治
    今年争取一百多个县市基本消灭血吸虫病，治疗20—30％的病人
    新华社上海26日电　在上海举行的第四次全国防治血吸虫病工作会议，向全国各地消灭血吸虫病的指战员们，发出了“鼓足干劲，全面跃进，苦战三年，加速消灭血吸虫病”的战斗号召。
    参加会议的各省市代表认为，防治血吸虫病完全应该来一个大跃进，以顽强的革命战斗精神与血吸虫展开大战。代表们表示，在1958年内，全国将在三分之一的流行血吸虫病的地区基本消灭血吸虫病。
    据会议反映的材料，去年各地结合兴修水利工作掀起了声势浩大的血吸虫病防治运动。全国已出现十三个基本消灭血吸虫病的县、市和两个郊区。这些县市是：江西省的余江、婺源、上犹、奉新、浮梁，湖北省的谷城、襄阳、大冶，湖南省的慈利，安徽省的祁门、太平，浙江省的德清、绍兴（市），和上海市的北郊区、东郊区。各地还有三百四十三个乡镇基本消灭了血吸虫的中间宿主钉螺。这一年，全国各地治疗了五十万病人，其中包括十万左右晚期病人。
    会议在总结过去的成就和经验中，得出了两条无可辩驳的结论。一条是基本消灭血吸虫病地区目前虽然还是为数不多，但是这十几个县、市能够做到的，其他的地区也一定能够做到。这十几个县、市的经验有力地证明，我们是能够战胜血吸虫病对人民的严重危害的。第二条是这些基本消灭血吸虫病地区的工作经验证明，依靠群众，实施积极防治方针，采取综合措施因时因地制宜的做法是正确的。企图否定积极防治方针，片面地强调只要粪便管理、消灭钉螺或者治疗病人等某一个环节就行了，而反对综合措施，那就必然不能完成消灭血吸虫病的任务。拥有最优良技术队伍的上海市，去年就是由于某些干部和技术人员骄傲自大、右倾保守，对新的创造发明不热心，干劲不大，特别是受了“以灭螺为主”的思想影响，治疗病人只完成去年计划的30％，成了一个落后的地区。会议指出，对于积极防治的方针和综合措施因时因地制宜的做法，是采取赞成还是采取反对的态度，正是血吸虫病防治工作中两条道路斗争的反映。只有批判掉右倾保守思想，走上积极防治的道路，才能使防治血吸虫病工作全面跃进。
    各地代表在会上交流了工作经验，对工作中的错误、缺点也都进行了严肃的自我批评。代表们一致表示，决心努力贯彻积极防治方针，发动广大群众，结合兴修农田水利和采取其他有效办法进行灭螺，结合堆积肥料和除四害进行粪便管理、杀灭血吸虫卵，同时积极推广锑剂三日疗法，推行巡回驻社治疗、门诊治疗等便利群众的办法，治疗更多的病人，以加速消灭血吸虫病。防治工作进行得比较晚的云南省，决心苦战两年，扫尾一年，在一年内赶上先进。上海市决心在今年把能够治疗的病人全部治完，并且完成嘉定、宝山、上海三县的全部治疗任务。会上，安徽、江苏、云南、上海的代表分别向江西、湖南、浙江、福建提出挑战，要提前实现消灭血吸虫病的规划。福建、广东、广西和上海市提出苦战一年，用一年或更多一些的时间扫尾，基本上消灭血吸虫病。湖南、浙江、云南和四川等省提出苦战两年，用一年到两年或更多一些的时间扫尾，基本上消灭血吸虫病。江西、江苏、安徽和湖北等省提出苦战三年，用一年到两年或更多一些时间扫尾，基本上消灭血吸虫病。
    各省市代表在会上都还提出了1958年的防治计划和保证措施。今年内要求有一百多个县市达到基本消灭血吸虫病，并且要求治疗全部病人20％—30％。
    这次会议是在2月10日到13日举行的，参加的有十二个省市的代表、科学家、医生等八十多人。农业部、水利部也派代表出席。
    会上，中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组负责人柯庆施、魏文伯先后作了报告和指示。
