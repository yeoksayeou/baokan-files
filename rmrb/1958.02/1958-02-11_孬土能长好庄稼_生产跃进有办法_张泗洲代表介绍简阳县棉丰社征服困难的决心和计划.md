I fully agree with and warmly support all the reports made at the conference. Now, I will give a brief report to the conference on how our Mianfeng Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jianyang County changed low-yield land, achieved bumper harvests of grain and cotton, and our 1958 agricultural production Great Leap Forward plan.

Our Mianfeng Commune Has Many Slopes and Poor Soil, But Achieved Bumper Cotton and Grain Harvests Last Year
Our Jianyang County is an economic crop area, rich in cotton. However, the land in our county varies in fertility, with mountains and plains interspersed, and the yield varies greatly, with cotton yields differing by eighty to one hundred jin. Our Mianfeng Commune is a third-class economic zone in the county, with many slopes and poor soil, generally only four inches thick, and the soil underneath is full of red rock valleys, which is not easy to keep water and soil. Our farmers call this kind of soil "water-pushed sand." If the drainage is not done well, a heavy rain will wash it all away, leaving only a bare mound. However, it was on such land that we achieved bumper harvests of grain and cotton in 1957. The total output value of agricultural and sideline products of the whole commune increased by 37.4% compared with 1956, and the total grain output increased by 15.6%. In the 1,700 mu of cotton fields, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu was 59.5 jin, an increase of 100% compared with 1956, and an increase of 35.6% compared with the historical peak year of 1955. In particular, among these cotton fields, there were 44.79 mu of barren land, each mu produced 100 to 110 jin of cotton, and the worst 13 mu of land produced 105 jin of cotton per mu. The bumper harvest of grain and cotton increased the income of every commune member. The average income per person increased by 60% compared with 1956. There were two "Five Guarantee" households in the commune. After their income increased, they had enough to eat and wear and asked to cancel the "Five Guarantees."

Why did our Mianfeng Commune achieve bumper harvests of grain and cotton in 1957, especially bumper cotton harvests? I think this is because, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the working class, the superior conditions of the advanced agricultural production cooperative have been fully utilized, especially the crucial measure of changing low yields to high yields. Our whole commune has a total of 4,431.2 mu of cultivated land, of which 46.8% is barren. This kind of low-yield land only yields more than ten jin of cotton per mu, which is sixty jin less compared with the high-yield land which can yield eighty jin per mu. That is to say, four or five mu of barren land is only worth one mu of good land. This situation shows us that increasing the unit area yield of low-yield land and changing low yields to high yields is the most important issue in changing the face of our Mianfeng Commune. However, how to increase the yield of low-yield land is not a simple issue. The first difficulty we encountered was the resistance in the minds of some commune members. Some people think that no matter how you do it, poor soil cannot grow good crops; others think that even sweet potatoes cannot grow well in this kind of land, and no one has ever done well in cotton cultivation. In 1956, our cotton production was slightly reduced due to climate influences, and the commune members became skeptical of the yield-increasing technical measures. Some said that the cotton yield was reduced because it was planted too densely. Therefore, when we put forward the slogan of changing low yields to high yields and striving to produce 80 jin of cotton per mu, some cadres and commune members lacked confidence, and some even said that the commune leader was "bragging" and "blowing his own horn."

These few people's cold words did not scare us. The commune management committee studied the masses' ideas and believed that it was not that the masses were unwilling to produce more cotton. Except for anti-socialist elements, who would not want to increase production? The masses lack confidence in changing poor soil into good soil, mainly because they are afraid of putting in effort and not getting any benefits, but losing everything. Our farmers are the most practical, but some people look at new methods with old eyes, with a little bit of empiricism and conservatism. Therefore, we organized all the commune members to have a big debate on the production in 1956. After a big debate, it became clear that the cotton production reduction in 1956 was not due to dense planting or early planting, but mainly due to poor field management, insufficient fertilizer and labor, and natural disasters. On the other hand, we also mobilized and organized some old farmers and activists to tell everyone how they achieved high yields on barren land. I also introduced my experience of cultivating more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu on this barren land to cadres and commune members. After these works, everyone's understanding was unified, their ideological concerns were eliminated, and their production confidence and enthusiasm were boosted.

Our Yield-Increasing Measures
I. Land Improvement; II. Raising Pigs and Accumulating Manure; III. Building Reservoirs.
Then, we took the following yield-increasing measures:

First, we worked on land improvement. As the saying goes: "If the land is improved, there is no need to ask, three loads of mud are equal to one load of manure." We added more than 2,000 loads of mud to each mu of land, and some added more than 3,000 loads. We improved 600 mu of land, and we picked about 180,000 dan of mud, and the soil layer was added to two or three inches thick, which was a big project. Although we suffered the same drought as in 1956 last autumn, the soil layer was thickened, which enhanced the ability to conserve water and fertilizer. Not only did the cotton not reduce production, but it generally increased production by 30% and achieved a bumper harvest. Old commune member Ma Zhicheng said with a smile: "I have lived for decades, and I have never seen such good cotton. In the past, when I worked alone, even sweet potatoes could not grow well. This year, after the land was improved, the cotton can yield 80, 90, or even 100 jin. It seems that socialism is really good!" The fact that the barren land was improved and a bumper cotton harvest was obtained educated all the commune members and enhanced their confidence in increasing production, and it also made those who thought that barren land could not increase production speechless.

Second, according to the production experience of 1956, we greatly developed pigs and increased a large amount of fertilizer. At the beginning of 1957, our commune appointed special personnel to manage the development of pigs, focusing on self-breeding and self-raising, and at the same time improving the feeding management methods. The advantage of self-breeding and self-raising is that the pigs are raised in a decentralized manner, which is easy to take care of, and there are fewer opportunities to contact sick pigs, so they are not easily infected. This has changed our past situation of "sick pigs never leaving, and dead pigs constantly." At the end of 1957, the whole commune had a total of 2,232 pigs, an average of 4.29 heads per household, an increase of 76% compared with 1956. This ensured the fertilizer needed for cotton. In 1957, the amount of fertilizer used per mu of cotton field increased by 41% compared with 1956. At the same time, according to different soil qualities, we also implemented the method of applying less fertilizer to the upper soil and more fertilizer to the lower soil. On average, 8 more loads of fertilizer were applied per mu of barren land, which promoted the growth of cotton in poor soil and achieved a large-area bumper harvest.

Third, we solved the problem of water use. A sufficient supply of water is necessary to ensure the good growth of cotton and achieve high cotton yields. The whole commune newly built 57 reservoirs, each solving the water use of 30 mu of land, which not only guaranteed the water source, but also reduced the amount of labor during the busy farming season.

Everyone Has Confidence, Yellow Soil Becomes Gold - One Year Plan Completes Five Year Plan
The above is the situation of our Mianfeng Commune's bumper harvest of cotton and grain in 1957. Now I will talk about our 1958 agricultural production plan. In the rectification movement of our Mianfeng Commune, after the great debate on the two roads and socialist education, the production enthusiasm of all our commune members is even more unprecedentedly high. At the meeting of commune member representatives, everyone said that they would go all out to carry out a large-scale production movement and strive for a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. Our commune's 1958 production plan is: cotton production will increase by 89.5% compared with 1957, and the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the whole commune's 2,215 mu of cotton fields will reach 113 jin, of which 30 mu of high-yield fields with a yield of 400 jin of ginned cotton per mu will be cultivated; the total grain output will increase by 77.7% compared with 1957, the grain yield per mu will be 800 jin, and the multiple cropping index will be increased to 220% (190% in 1957); the average rice yield per mu will be 800 jin, of which 40 mu will reach 1,300 jin; the average sweet potato yield per mu will be 4,500 jin, of which 200 mu will reach 10,000 jin; the average yield of double-season corn per mu will reach 800 jin; and the number of live pigs will increase to 5,228 by the end of the year. And continue to improve 800 mu of barren land. In this way, the total output value in 1958 will increase by 103% compared with 1957. Not only that, our Mianfeng Commune has also made a preliminary five-year plan for cotton, grain, and pigs from 1958 to 1962. By 1962, the cotton yield per mu will be 300 jin of ginned cotton, the grain yield per mu will be 4,500 jin (including sweet potatoes, with 400 jin converted to 100 jin of grain), the sweet potato yield per mu will be 34,000 jin, the number of public pigs will increase to 13,000, and the number of privately owned pigs will increase to 2,000, totaling 15,000. In addition to public grain and unified purchase, the whole commune will also retain 320,000 yuan of public accumulation fund and public welfare fund, and reserve 3.6 million jin of grain, an average of 1,200 jin per person. By then, if each person works 30 labor days per month, they can get 149 yuan; and each person can get an average of 1,800 jin of grain per year, including cash, a total of 446 yuan, which is more than seven times the income of the current well-off middle peasants, and the face of our commune will be completely renewed.

Now, this Great Leap Forward production plan has been approved by all commune members and has been contracted to each work group. Through the educational facts of the 1957 production increase, everyone now fully realizes that "there is no barren land, only lazy people," "as long as fertilizer is accumulated more, technology and seasons are grasped tightly, there are millions of jin everywhere" (that is, 1,000 jin of grain per mu; 100 jin of cotton; 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes). At the meeting of commune member representatives, everyone said that they were determined to complete the 1958 production plan, as long as "everyone has confidence, yellow soil becomes gold," "everyone has determination, and an iron rod can be ground into an embroidery needle."

When I set off to Beijing, it was in full swing in our Mianfeng Commune. In addition to accumulating fertilizer, making fertilizer, and improving land, we also plan to renovate the existing 57 reservoirs and build 120 new ones, striving to fill them all with water before the Awakening of Insects. At present, a high tide of water conservancy construction is being set off. Many commune members go to the construction site before dawn and do not stop work until dark, lighting gas lamps to continue working. When the kerosene is used up, the commune members work under the moonlight, saying, "The moon is our electric lamp." The mountains and hills are densely packed with people, and the sound of hoes and drills, mixed with singing, resonates, which is so lively! We are determined to complete the cotton sowing around the Qingming Festival, and all will be replaced with improved Daizi cotton seeds.

Dear representatives: Our Mianfeng Commune firmly believes that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the working class brothers, our 1958 Great Leap Forward production plan will be successfully completed. We guarantee that we will do what we say and not make empty promises.

    孬土能长好庄稼　生产跃进有办法
    张泗洲代表介绍简阳县棉丰社征服困难的决心和计划
    我完全同意和热烈拥护大会所作的各项报告。现在，我把我们简阳县棉丰高级农业生产合作社改变低产地，获得了粮、棉大丰收和一九五八年的农业生产大跃进的规划向大会作个简要汇报。
    棉丰社山坡多土质很坏  但去年做到棉粮大丰收
    我们简阳县是个经济作物区，全县盛产棉花。但是，我们县里的土地肥瘦不一，山区、平地间杂，产量差别也大，棉花产量高低有相差八十到一百斤的。我们棉丰社在全县是属于三类经济区，山坡多，土质很坏，一般只有四寸来厚，土底下尽是红石谷子，水土不容易保持。我们农民叫这种土为“水推沙”，如果开沟排水搞不好，一次大雨，就会全部冲刷得只剩下个光包包。但是，就在这样的土地上，我们在一九五七年却获得了粮、棉大丰收，全社的农副业总产值比一九五六年增加了百分之三十七点四，粮食总产量增加了百分之一十五点六，在一千七百亩棉田中，棉花每亩平均产皮棉五十九斤五两，比一九五六年增加了一倍，比历史上最高年产量的一九五五年增加了百分之三十五点六。特别是在这些棉田中，有四十四点七九亩瘠薄土，每亩产棉一百至一百一十斤，并有最孬的十三亩地，每亩产棉一百零五斤。粮、棉的大丰收，使得每一个社员都增加了收入，每人平均收入比一九五六年增加百分之六十，社里有两个五保户，收入增加后，够吃够穿，要求取消五保。
    我们棉丰社为什么能够获得一九五七年的粮、棉大丰收，特别是棉花大丰收呢？我认为：这就是在中国共产党和工人阶级的正确领导下，充分发挥了高级农业生产合作社的优越条件，特别是抓住了变低产为高产的这个极其重要的增产措施。我们全社共有耕地四千四百三十一点二亩，其中贫瘠的土地就占百分之四十六点八，这种低产地每亩只收棉花十多斤，与高产地每亩可收八十斤相比较，竟相差到六十多斤，也就是说，要四五亩贫瘠地才抵得上一亩好地的收成。这种情况向我们说明：提高低产土地的单位面积产量，变低产为高产，是改变我们棉丰社面貌的最重要的问题。但是，如何提高低产土地的产量，这不是一个简单的问题，首先碰到的困难，就是不少社员的思想有抵触。有的认为，随便咋个搞，孬土就是种不出好庄稼；有的认为，这样的土地，种上红苕都不倒藤，几辈人都没有搞好过，棉花怎样搞得好。一九五六年我们棉花因气候影响收成略有减少，社员对增产的技术措施就产生了怀疑，有的就说，棉花减了产就是由于种得太密搞拐了。因此，我们提出变低产为高产，争取产棉八十斤的响亮口号后，一些干部和社员都缺乏信心，有的还说二话，说社长又在“冲壳子”，吹牛皮。
    这些少数人的冷言冷语没有吓倒我们，社务委员会研究了群众的思想，认为并不是群众不愿意多产棉花，除了反社会主义分子以外，那一个不愿意增产呢。群众对变孬土为好土缺乏信心，主要是怕出了力气不讨好，反而把老本丢光。我们农民是最讲实际的，但有的人用老眼光来看新办法，有点经验主义，也有点保守主义。因此，我们就一方面组织全体社员对一九五六年的生产展开了大辩论。经过大争大辩，结果弄清楚了一九五六年棉花减了产并不是种密了，种早了，主要是田间管理差，肥料、劳力没有跟上，又受到了自然灾害。另一方面，我们又发动组织了一些老农、积极分子，把他们怎样在贫瘠土地上获得了高产的经过向大家摆谈。我自己也在干部和社员中把我亲自在这种瘦土上培育亩产百多斤皮棉的经验作了介绍。经过这些工作，大家的认识就统一了，思想顾虑也消除了，生产信心和干劲也就鼓起来了。
    我们的增产措施
    一、土地加工；二、养猪积肥；
    三、修蓄水池。
    跟着，我们采取了下面几个增产措施：
    首先，就搞土地加工。俗话说：“土地加工不用问，三挑泥巴当挑粪。”每亩地我们都加了两千多挑泥巴，有的并加到三千挑以上。我们加工了六百亩地，就挑了大约十八万担泥巴，土层加到两三寸厚，这是一项很大的工程。去年秋季虽又遭到了和一九五六年同样的旱灾，但是，土层加厚了，增强了保水保肥能力，棉花不但没有减产，反而一般都增产了百分之三十，获得了丰收。老社员马治成看到这个情况，喜笑颜开的说：“我活了几十岁，从没有见过那样好的棉花，以往单干时种的红苕都不倒藤，今年加了工，棉花收八、九十斤甚至一百斤，这样看来，社会主义真正好！”贫瘠土地加工后获得的棉花大丰收的事实，使全体社员受到了教育，增强了增产的信心，也使那些认为贫瘠土根本不能增加生产的人哑口无言了。
    其次，根据一九五六年生产经验，我们大量发展了生猪，增加了大量的肥料。我们社在一九五七年一开始，就指定专人管理发展生猪的事，着重搞自繁自养，同时改进了饲养管理方法。自繁自养的好处，就是分散养猪，便于照顾，与病猪接触的机会少，不容易受到传染。这就改变了我们过去“病猪不离，死猪不断”的情况。一九五七年底，全社共有生猪二千二百三十二头，每户平均四点二九头，比一九五六年增加百分之七十六。这就保证了棉花所需要的肥料。一九五七年每亩棉田用肥就比一九五六年增加百分之四十一。同时，根据不同土质，我们并实行了上土少施，下土多施的办法，贫瘠地平均每亩多施八挑，促进了孬土内棉花的生长，获得了大面积丰收。
    第三，我们解决了用水问题。要有充足的水分供应，才能保证棉花的生长良好，达到棉花高产。全社新修了五十七个蓄水池，每个解决三十亩地的用水，不但保证了水源，又减少了农忙时的劳动量。
    人人有信心　黄土变成金  一年计划五年计划定完成
    以上就是我们棉丰社一九五七年获得棉、粮大丰收的情况。现在我再讲一讲我们一九五八年农业生产的规划。我们棉丰社在整风运动中，经过两条道路的大辩论和社会主义教育，我们全体社员的生产热情更是空前高涨。在社员代表大会上，大家表示要鼓足干劲，开展一个规模巨大的生产运动，争取农业生产大跃进。我们社订出的一九五八年生产计划是：棉花产量比一九五七年增加百分之八十九点五，要做到全社二千二百一十五亩棉田平均每亩产一百一十三斤，其中，培育三十亩亩产四百斤皮棉的高产田；粮食总产量比一九五七年增加百分之七十七点七，粮食亩产八百斤，复种指数提高到百分之二百二十（一九五七年是百分之一百九十）；水稻平均亩产八百斤，其中四十亩达到一千三百斤；红苕平均亩产四千五百斤，其中二百亩达到一万斤；双季玉米平均每亩达到八百斤；生猎到年底发展到五千二百二十八头。并且继续对八百亩贫瘠土地进行加工。这样，一九五八年生产总值将要比一九五七年增加百分之一百零三。不仅如此，我们棉丰社还对棉花、粮食、生猪进行了一九五八年至一九六二年的五年初步规划。到一九六二年，棉花亩产三百斤皮棉，粮食亩产四千五百斤（包括红苕四百斤折一百斤粮食计算的），红苕亩产三万四千斤，公共猪发展到一万三千头，私有发展到二千头，合计一万五千头。全社除了公粮，统购以外，还提留公积金、公益金三十二万元，储备粮三百六十万斤，每人平均一千二百斤。到那时，每个人如果每月做三十个劳动日，可分一百四十九元；而每年每人平均可分粮食一千八百斤，包括现金一共可分四百四十六元，超过目前富裕中农收入的七倍，我社的面貌也将根本上焕然一新。
    现在，这个大跃进的生产计划，已经为全体社员通过，并且全部进行了包工包产。通过一九五七年增产的事实教育，现在大家充分认识到“没有瘦土，只有瘦人”，“只要肥料积得多，技术、季节抓得紧，遍地都是千百万斤”（即亩产千斤粮食；百斤棉花；万斤红苕）。在社员代表大会上，大家表示，坚决要完成一九五八年生产计划，只要“人人有信心，黄土变成金”，“大家有决心，毛铁磨成绣花针”。
    我动身来北京的时候，在我们棉丰社，正搞得热火朝天。除了搞积肥、造肥、土地加工以外，我们还计划将已有的五十七口蓄水池加以整修，并新修一百二十口，争取在惊蛰以前全部灌满水。目前正掀起一个兴修水利的高潮，许多社员天不亮就上工地，天黑了不收工，点起煤气灯继续干活。煤油点完了，社员就顶着月亮干，他们说：“月亮就是我们的自来电灯”。山上山下，到处密密麻麻都是人，锄头声，钻子声，和着唱歌声，响成一片，好不热闹！我们决心要在清明节前后完成棉花下种，并且全部换用良种岱字棉。
    各位代表：我们棉丰社全体社员坚决相信，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在工人老大哥的帮助下，我们一九五八年生产大跃进的计划一定能够胜利完成，我们保证说到做到，不放空炮。
