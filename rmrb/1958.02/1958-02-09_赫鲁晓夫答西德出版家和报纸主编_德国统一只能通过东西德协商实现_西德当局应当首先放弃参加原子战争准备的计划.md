Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 8th: TASS Moscow, February 7th: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, N.S. Khrushchev, received West German publisher Axel Springer and the editor of the Hamburg "Die Welt," Hans Zehrer, on January 29th and spoke with them.

　　The Path to Restoring German Unity

　　Springer asked: If discussions begin on the possibility of restoring German unity, would this be a good initiative now, and would it contribute to easing international tensions?

　　Khrushchev said that the key to solving the issue of restoring German unity, a matter of concern to all Germans, should not be sought in Moscow, nor in Washington, Paris, or London. It should be sought in Bonn and Berlin. It would be a great mistake to expect someone from the outside to bring unity to your country or to expect the mediating role of some national governments to replace the efforts of the German people themselves. The unity of the country can only be the result of the rapprochement and consultation between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

　　The Soviet government recently pointed out in a letter to Mr. Adenauer the particularity of the situation facing the problem of German reunification. That is to say, this is not a general problem in international practice, but a task facing us for the first time in history: to peacefully unite two sovereign states with different socio-economic structures. If we try to mechanically merge two countries that are developing in completely different directions, according to old formulas, can we successfully solve this problem?

　　In answering how to practically achieve mutual understanding between the two German governments, Khrushchev said that a unified Germany is a two-way process, which cannot be completed without the participation of the two Germanies. However, one of the governments, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, pretends as if the other German state does not exist on the map. This attitude of the West German government violates the demands of reason.

　　Khrushchev said that apart from the proposals put forward by the German Democratic Republic, I do not see, and there are obviously no other proposals with any hope of success for solving this problem. This proposal is to establish a confederation of the two Germanies, that is, to unite the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany based on treaties to adopt a common policy on a certain range of domestic and foreign affairs. And, first of all, to bring the two Germanies closer together on the basis of joint actions to ease tensions between countries and prevent the danger of a new war.

　　What the West German Government Should Do

　　The visitors asked whether the German question depends to some extent on the easing of international tensions. On the other hand, the easing of the international situation depends to some extent on the resolution of the German question. What should the Federal Government do to actively promote the resolution of these two issues?

　　Khrushchev replied: We have stated our views more than once, believing that Germany as a whole and the Federal Republic of Germany in the past and present have great potential to influence the situation in Europe, and even beyond Europe. It is no exaggeration to say that if the Federal Republic of Germany can work together with the Soviet Union and other countries to seek to ease international tensions and prevent the danger of a new war, then peace in Europe will have a solid guarantee. Unfortunately, it is not yet apparent that the Federal Government is prepared to work in this direction.

　　Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Is Not a Fantasy

　　Khrushchev talked about the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe. He said that the establishment of this zone now actually lacks only the support of the West German government.

　　Those who hold important positions in West Germany and are responsible for national policy say that such a zone is a "fantasy." They believe that there is no guarantee that atomic war will not break out within the territory of countries participating in a nuclear-weapon-free zone. I think that putting forward this reason is either an unwillingness to look at the actual content of the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone or a complete unwillingness to do any useful work to prevent the outbreak of atomic war in Europe. In fact, the Soviet government has already stated that it is willing to work with other countries to use reliable international guarantees to ensure the atomic neutrality of the countries participating in the nuclear-weapon-free zone, in order to eliminate the possibility of the use of such weapons in this zone. In addition, the Soviet Union also believes that the countries concerned can reach an agreement to implement broad supervision over measures related to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. All of this shows that it is at least a fabrication to insist that a nuclear-weapon-free zone is a "fantasy."

　　Khrushchev said that the Federal Republic is now also facing the issue of setting up American atomic bases and rocket launching sites in West Germany. He said that if the Federal Republic of Germany is willing to contribute to the cause of easing international tensions, then it should first abandon its plans to participate in atomic war preparations—the plans to set up American atomic bases and rocket bases in West Germany and to equip the Federal Defense Forces with atomic weapons. The Federal Government can also devote itself to solving such an important problem of consolidating peace as the conclusion of some form of non-aggression treaty between the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization.

　　Khrushchev said that West Germany has paid great attention to the following proposal of the Soviet government: to gradually reduce foreign troops in the countries of the North Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Treaty, and in the next stage to completely withdraw foreign troops from these countries, while removing foreign military bases. These measures should be implemented in Germany first. As everyone knows, the Federal Government has taken a negative attitude towards the proposal to reduce and finally withdraw foreign troops from Germany, which of course will not promote the resolution of this issue, which is very important for easing international tensions.

　　In short, as long as the Federal Republic of Germany is willing, the scope of activities for easing international tensions is very broad: there is much to be done, whether in terms of disarmament, consolidating European security, or improving relations with other countries. At the very least, the Federal Republic of Germany should not take measures that could exacerbate the danger of war and international tensions. The decision-makers of the Federal Republic of Germany had better not rely on a "position of strength" policy, but should rely on a "policy of reason" (if one can say so), that is, for the sake of their own national interests and the interests of consolidating peace.

　　The Question of Concluding a Peace Treaty with Germany

　　In answering the question about concluding a peace treaty with Germany, Khrushchev said that given the Western countries' negative attitude towards concluding a peace treaty with Germany, the Soviet government has already announced the termination of the state of war with Germany, which is one thing, while a peace treaty determining external conditions (observing these conditions, the internal development of Germany will prevent any external interference) is another. The Soviet government has always advocated a fundamental solution to the German question by concluding a peace treaty with Germany throughout the post-war period. Considering that there are currently two sovereign states in Germany—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—it is important not to delay the formulation of a draft treaty so that the German people have a clear prospect for the future development of Germany. Naturally, the Germans themselves—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—should participate in the formulation of this draft. The German Democratic Republic's proposal to establish a German Confederation opens up the most realistic possibility for concluding a peace treaty with Germany. In this case, a peace treaty can be concluded with either the Confederation organs or with the governments of the two countries included in the Confederation.

　　Views on the Future Military Status of Germany

　　In answering the view on the future military status of Germany, Khrushchev said,

　　This question should be resolved in essence according to the peace treaty with Germany, which is an integral part of the treaty. Since we support the formulation of a peace treaty with Germany, we naturally agree to determine Germany's military status now. Given that people from all walks of life in West Germany believe that the issue of military status is of particular significance, the Soviet Union is prepared to extract this issue from other clauses of the treaty for separate study.

　　Khrushchev said that the government of the German Democratic Republic has put forward a series of proposals and taken some practical measures. We believe that these proposals and measures are an appropriate basis for future consultations on Germany's military status. The German Democratic Republic voluntarily limited its troop numbers to 90,000. The government of the German Democratic Republic has done its best to ensure that no atomic weapons and rocket weapons, German or foreign, exist on German soil. In addition, the government of the German Democratic Republic stated that if the Federal Republic of Germany withdraws from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, then it is also prepared to withdraw from the Warsaw Treaty Organization and expressed its willingness to reach an agreement with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the maximum number of armed forces of the two Germanies. It must be estimated that the military status of Germany is formed by two parts, and reaching an agreement on this issue depends first and foremost on the military measures currently implemented by the two Germanies.

　　Khrushchev then pointed out that the situation of the Federal Republic of Germany is different from that of the German Democratic Republic. It implements conscription. The established corps there are under the command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany is unwilling to even listen to the proposal to sign some kind of agreement with the German Democratic Republic stipulating the level of the armed forces of the two Germanies. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany is striving to equip the West German Federal Defense Forces with atomic weapons and rocket weapons, and to engage in research on the production of the latest types of weapons. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany's actions in using West German territory to set up American atomic weapons storage depots and rocket and nuclear weapons launching sites are also incompatible with the proposal to determine Germany's current or future military status. The Federal Republic of Germany has not expressed once up to now that it is willing to reject certain military measures stipulated in the military strategic plan of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for the sake of the country's reunification. Not only that, but the Federal Government has always tried to emphasize that fulfilling the military obligations in the Paris Agreement is particularly important to it. In order to show its loyalty to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Federal Government fully agreed with the plan repeatedly proposed by the three Western countries at international conferences to have the entire Germany participate in this military bloc, although such a request can only be a fantasy.

　　The Two Germanies Should Abandon Weapons of Mass Destruction

　　Khrushchev said that a mutually acceptable method for solving the problem of Germany's military status can only be found through the rapprochement and mutual understanding between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The two Germanies should unconditionally abandon all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, that is to say, on the one hand, they themselves should not produce atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons, and on the other hand, they should not equip their armed forces with such weapons manufactured by foreign countries; no other country should be allowed to establish atomic and rocket bases in their territory. After the two Germanies embark on the road to restoring national unity, they should withdraw from the military groups they are currently participating in. Finally, the number of armed forces of the two Germanies must be determined through an agreement between the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, based on their needs for self-defense and safeguarding domestic security.

　　Tensions in East and West Berlin Should Be Eliminated

　　In answering the question about normalizing the situation in Berlin, Khrushchev said, we believe that for the benefit of the residents of Berlin, the German authorities in East Berlin and West Berlin must eliminate the current state of tension in their mutual relations and cooperate with each other in municipal management and other aspects. The Soviet Union believes that as long as the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the municipal government of West Berlin are willing to find a mutually acceptable solution for them and the German Democratic Republic to mediate the Berlin issue, a solution can be found, and the Soviet Union will only welcome such a development of the situation.

　　Negotiations Between the Soviet Union and West Germany Can Achieve Good Results

　　When talking about the prospects for the development of relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany, Khrushchev mentioned that the successful completion of the negotiations currently being conducted in Moscow by the delegations of the Soviet Union and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is of great significance. As agreed by the two governments, the purpose of this negotiation is to improve the relations between our two countries. If we judge the prospects of the negotiations based on the results achieved today, then there is every reason to expect that these negotiations will achieve good results in the discussion of all issues.

　　Khrushchev asked Springer to convey to West German readers that the Soviet Union is seriously and consistently working to bring the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany closer and to achieve mutual understanding. We hope to completely eliminate the distrust and suspicion that have not yet been eliminated in the relations between our two countries. In my opinion, establishing contacts between parliaments and individual national leaders and social figures, and stopping hostile propaganda will promote the improvement of relations between our two countries, which is necessary.

　　赫鲁晓夫答西德出版家和报纸主编
    德国统一只能通过东西德协商实现
    西德当局应当首先放弃参加原子战争准备的计划
    新华社8日讯　塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫1月29日接见了西德出版家阿克塞尔·施普林格和汉堡“世界报”主编汉斯·策雷尔，并且同他们谈话。
    恢复德国统一的途径
    施普林格问：如果开始讨论恢复德国统一的可能性，这在现在是否是良好的倡议，同时是不是对缓和国际紧张局势方面的贡献？
    赫鲁晓夫说，解决所有德国人都关心的问题——恢复德国统一的可能性问题的钥匙不应当到莫斯科寻找，也不应当到华盛顿、巴黎或是伦敦寻找。而应当到波恩和柏林寻找。如果期待什么人从外面给贵国带来统一或是期待用某些国家政府的调停作用来代替德国人民自身的努力，那就大错特错了。国家的统一只能是德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国接近和协商的结果。
    苏联政府在不久前给阿登纳先生的信件中曾经指出解决统一德国问题所面临的情况的特殊性，也就是说，这不是国际实践中的一般问题，而是面对着一个有史以来第一次出现的任务：把两个具有不同社会经济结构的主权国家和平统一起来。如果按照过去的陈旧公式，企图把两个朝着绝对不同方向发展的国家机械地并在一起，难道可以成功地解决这个问题吗？
    在回答怎样才能实际达到两个德国政府的相互谅解的问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，统一德国是双方面的过程，没有两个德国的参加是不可能完成的。然而其中的一个政府，即德意志联邦共和国政府装出一副模样，仿佛地图上不存在另一个德意志国家。西德政府的这种态度是违反理智的要求的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，除了德意志民主共和国提出的建议外，我看不到，而且显然也没有其他的有成功希望的解决这个问题的建议了，这个建议就是建立两个德国的邦联，即根据条约统一德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国以便就一定范围的内政外交问题采取共同政策，并且，首先在缓和各国间紧张关系和防止新战争危险方面采取联合行动的基础上使两个德国接近起来。
    西德政府该做什么
    来访者问到德国问题在一定程度上取决于国际紧张局势的缓和。从另一方面讲，国际局势的缓和在一定程度上又取决于德国问题的解决。为了积极促进这两个问题的解决，联邦政府方面应该做些什么？
    赫鲁晓夫答道：我们曾经不止一次地表示我们的见解，认为整个德国以及德意志联邦共和国过去和现在一直具有很大的潜力，能够对欧洲的局势发生影响，甚至不限于欧洲。可以毫不夸大地说，如果德意志联邦共和国能够同苏联和其他国家同心协力谋求缓和国际紧张局势和防止新战争的危险，那末欧洲的和平就有了牢固的保证。遗憾的是，目前还看不出联邦政府准备朝这方面努力。
　　无原子武器区绝非幻想
    赫鲁晓夫谈到在欧洲建立无原子武器地区的主张。他说，对于建立这个地区现在实际上只缺少西德政府的支持了。
    那些在西德占显要地位、负责国家政策的人说，这种地区是“幻想”，他们认为，要参加无原子武器地区的国家境内不爆发原子战争，是没有什么保证的。我认为，提出这种理由，不是不愿意看一看关于建立无原子武器地区的建议中的实际内容，就是根本不愿意做些什么有益的工作来防止在欧洲爆发原子战争。事实上苏联政府已经声明，它愿意同其他国家一道用可靠的国际保证来保障无原子武器地区参加国的原子中立，以排除在这个地区使用这种武器的可能性。此外，苏联还认为，有关国家还可以达成协议，对有关建立无原子武器地区的措施实行广泛的监督。这一切都说明，硬说无原子武器地区是“幻想”，那至少是一种虚构的说法。
    赫鲁晓夫说，联邦共和国现在还要解决在西德设置美国原子基地和火箭发射场的问题。他说，如果德意志联邦共和国愿意对缓和国际紧张局势的事业作出贡献，那末它首先就应当放弃参加原子战争准备的计划——在西德境内设置美国的原子基地和火箭基地以及用原子武器装备联邦国防军的计划。联邦政府还可以致力于解决这样的巩固和平的重要问题，如北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织的参加国之间缔结某种形式的互不侵犯条约。
    赫鲁晓夫说，西德对苏联政府的下面的建议十分注意：逐步减少北大西洋联盟和华沙条约各国境内的外国军队，并且在下一阶段使外国军队完全撤出这些国家，同时撤除外国的军事基地，这些措施应当从德国先实行起来。大家知道，联邦政府对减少和最后撤出德国境内的外国军队的建议采取了否定的态度，这当然不会促进这个对于缓和国际紧张局势十分重要的问题的解决。
      总而言之，只要德意志联邦共和国愿意，那么缓和国际紧张局势的活动范围是很广阔的：无论是在裁军方面，在巩固欧洲安全方面，或是在改善同其他国家的关系方面，都大有可为。至少，德意志联邦共和国应当不采取那种足以加剧战争危险和国际紧张局势的措施。德意志联邦共和国的决策者最好不要依附“实力地位”政策，而应当依据“理智地位政策”（如果可以这样说的话），也就是为本国民族利益和巩固和平的利益着想。
    缔结对德和约的问题
    在回答关于缔结对德和约的问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，鉴于西方国家对缔结对德和约采取消极态度，苏联政府已经宣布终止同德国的战争状态，这是一回事，而确定外部条件（遵守这些条件，德国内部的发展就会防止外来的任何干涉）的和约，则是另一回事。苏联政府在整个战后期间一直主张通过缔结对德和约来根本解决德国问题。考虑到目前德国存在着两个主权国家——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国，重要的是不再拖延制定和约草案，以便使德国人民有一个德国将来发展的明确前景。自然，参加制定这一草案的应当有德国人自己——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国。德意志民主共和国关于建立德意志邦联的建议为同德国缔结和约开辟了最现实的可能性。在这种情况下，既可以同邦联机关缔结和约，也可以同邦联所包括的两个国家的政府缔结和约。
    对未来德国军事地位的看法
    在回答对未来的德国的军事地位的看法时，赫鲁晓夫说，
  这个问题就其实质来说应当根据对德和约来解决，它是和约的一个组成部分。我们既然拥护制定对德和约，自然赞成现在就确定德国的军事地位。鉴于西德各界广大人士认为军事地位问题具有特殊意义，苏联准备把这个问题从和约的其他条款中提出来，加以单独研究。
    赫鲁晓夫说，德意志民主共和国政府方面已经提出了一系列的建议并采取了一些实际措施，我们认为这些建议和措施是将来协商德国军事地位的适当基础。德意志民主共和国自愿把它的军队人数限制在九万人的水平上，德意志民主共和国政府竭尽全力使德国土地上不存在德国的和外国的任何原子武器和火箭武器，此外，德意志民主共和国政府表示，如果德意志联邦共和国退出北大西洋公约组织，那么它也准备退出华沙条约组织，并且表示愿意同德意志联邦共和国政府达成关于两个德国武装部队人数最高限额的协议。必须估计到，德国的军事地位是由两部分形成的，要对这个问题达成协议首先决定于两个德国现在所实行的军事性措施。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，德意志联邦共和国的情况同德意志民主共和国不同，它在实行义务兵役制。那里建立的兵团已归北大西洋公约组织司令部指挥。德意志联邦共和国政府对同德意志民主共和国签订某种规定两个德国武装部队水平的协定的主张连听都不愿意听。德意志联邦共和国政府竭力希望用原子武器和火箭武器装备西德联邦国防军以及从事研究生产最新式武器的工作。德意志联邦共和国政府使西德领土被用来设置美国原子武器贮存库以及火箭和核武器发射场的行为同决定德国现在或将来的军事地位的主张也是格格不入的。德意志联邦共和国直到现在一次也没有表示过它愿意为了国家的重新统一着想而拒绝北大西洋公约组织军事战略计划所规定的某些军事措施。非但如此，联邦政府还总是尽力强调说，执行巴黎协定中的军事义务对它说来是特别重要的。联邦政府为了表示它对北大西洋公约组织的忠心，完全同意三个西方国家不止一次在国际会议上提出的要整个德国参加到这个军事集团的计划，虽然这种要求只能是幻想。
    两个德国应放弃毁灭性武器
    赫鲁晓夫说，只有通过德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国互相接近和互相谅解的途径才能找到双方可以接受的、解决德国军事地位问题的方法。两个德国应当无条件放弃各种大规模毁灭性武器，也就是说，一方面自己不生产原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器，同时也不用外国制造的这种武器来装备本国的武装部队；不容许其他国家在本国境内建立原子和火箭基地。两个德国走上了恢复民族统一的道路后，就应当退出它们目前所参加的军事集团。最后，必须通过德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国两国政府达成协议的方式，根据它们自卫和保障国内安全的需要来确定两个德国的武装部队的名额。
    东西柏林的紧张状态应消除
    在回答关于使柏林情况正常化的问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，为了柏林居民的利益，东柏林和西柏林的德国当局必须消除现在相互关系中的紧张状态，互相在市政管理及其他方面进行合作。苏联认为，只要德意志联邦共和国政府和西柏林市政府愿意寻找它们和德意志民主共和国双方都可以接受的解决办法来调解柏林问题，解决的办法是可以找得到的，苏联对事态的这种发展只会表示欢迎。
    苏联和西德谈判能取得良好结果
    在谈到苏联和西德的关系的发展前途时，赫鲁晓夫提到胜利地完成苏联和德意志联邦共和国政府代表团现在在莫斯科所进行的谈判具有重大意义，正如两国政府所议定的那样，这次谈判的目的在于改善我们两国的关系。如果根据今天所取得的结果来判断谈判的前景的话，那么有一切根据可以预料，这次谈判会使一切问题的讨论都取得良好的结果。
    赫鲁晓夫请施普林格转告西德读者，苏联是认真地、始终不渝地努力使苏联和德意志联邦共和国接近和取得相互了解的。我们希望彻底消除在我们两国关系中尚未消除的不信任和猜疑。在我看来，建立议会间以及个别的国家领导人和社会人士间的接触、停止敌意宣传会促进我们两国关系的好转，这种好转是必要的。
