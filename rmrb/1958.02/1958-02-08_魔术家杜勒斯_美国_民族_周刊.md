    Magician Dulles
    -- U.S. "The Nation" Weekly

    On the eve of Dulles' appearance at the National Press Club, calls for his resignation had reached an unprecedented high. Now, efforts are being made to make it appear as if Dulles has won a new vote of confidence through his brilliant performance. According to all accounts, "Magician Foster" performed admirably, pulling rabbits out of hats, cards from sleeves, and birds from his hair. One distracting trick employed by Mr. Dulles took the form of proposing the establishment of "some international committee" to study the management of outer space issues. On this point, we could negotiate with the Russians endlessly from now on. Then came a clever maneuver, a hasty and obvious trick, quickly moving on to other topics before the audience realized it was a deception. The Secretary of State, with his owl-like eyes blinking and a half-smile playing on his lips, earnestly assured this notoriously vigilant and difficult-to-deceive audience that the Soviets had refused to implement the agreement "reached in Geneva" on the reunification of Germany. However, the Soviets certainly did not agree to the reunification of Germany in Geneva; they only agreed to consider reunification within the framework of a general European security arrangement, which is an entirely different matter. The next trick was to create the illusion of truth by presenting a powerful, substantial proposal lacking the reality to match or accompany it. For example, there were three harsh and biting statements about the difficulty of negotiating with the Russians, but no mention of the fact that the State Department had just concluded four months of successful negotiations with a Soviet ambassador on delegations for cultural and scientific exchanges. Anyone you ask will tell you that these negotiations went relatively smoothly.

    Although his methods are old hat, the Secretary of State's acting is first-rate, and the audience naturally applauded. But applause does not mean Mr. Dulles has gotten away with it. On the contrary, the mass pressure for summit talks is growing; the widespread unrest calling for new concepts, new initiatives, and fresh plans has not subsided. Whether he knows it or not, time is pressing on the Secretary of State.

    The Secretary of State wants to maintain the pressure of the Cold War across the board, hoping that the Soviets will either surrender or collapse. This is not a policy; it is a fixed assertion. Mr. Dulles confidently expects—he reaffirmed his confidence at the National Press Club—that the Soviet system will collapse due to "a fatal weakness," which means that the system cannot win the hearts of the younger generation.

    Therefore, it is very logical that Mr. Dulles does not intend to ease tensions, if he can avoid it. For him, it is not a question of whether the conditions are favorable; negotiating on fundamental issues under any conditions would be a mistake. One does not negotiate with an opponent who has a "fatal weakness" and is sure to collapse—as Mr. Dulles cheerfully tells us, if not next week, then "within ten years or a generation." Basically, as liberal Democrats are unhappily beginning to discover, this is also Mr. Acheson's position; in fact, their current problem is to disassociate themselves from Mr. Acheson. Then, the "fatal weakness" in the positions of Dulles and Acheson is precisely that they are based on an assumption that is not supported by the experience of the past decade. (February 1st)

专栏：外论摘要

　　魔术家杜勒斯
　　——美国“民族”周刊
    在杜勒斯在全国新闻俱乐部露面的前夕，要求他下台的呼声高到了空前的程度。现在有人在努力使事情看起来似乎是杜勒斯这次靠他的精彩表演已赢得了新的信任票。根据所有的消息来看，“魔术家福斯特”表演得很出色，从帽子里拿出兔子，从袖子里取出纸牌并且从头发里拿出鸟来。杜勒斯先生的用来转移人们的注意力的一个迷惑人的手法采取的形式是提出指定“某种国际委员会”来研究管理外层空间问题的建议。关于这点，我们能够从现在起同俄国人谈判个没有完。接着就是耍一个巧妙的手段，急急忙忙耍了一个明显的花招，然后在观众还没有意识到这是一种骗术以前赶紧转到其它话题上去。这位国务卿猫头鹰似的眼睛眨呀眨的，嘴唇上挂着半丝微笑，热诚地向这一群以警惕性高出名的、难以欺骗的听众保证说，苏联人拒绝执行“在日内瓦达成的”重新统一德国问题的协议。但是，苏联人当然并没有在日内瓦同意德国重新统一的问题；他们只是同意在作出一种一般性的欧洲安全的安排的情况下考虑重新统一的问题，而这完全是另外一回事。下一个把戏就是用提出一个有力、有内容、然而却缺少应该与之相配或者相伴的真实情况的建议的办法来造成一种真话的错觉。例如有三段刻薄和辛辣的话谈到了同俄国人谈判的困难，但没有提到这样一个事实：国务院刚刚结束了同苏联大使就文化和科学交流的代表团所进行的为时四个月的成功的谈判。无论问谁，这些谈判是进行得比较顺利的。
    虽然他的手法是老一套，这位国务卿的演技还是第一流的，观众自然也鼓了掌。但鼓掌并不意味着杜勒斯先生已经过了关。相反，要求举行最高级谈判的群众压力愈来愈大；要求新概念，新的主动和新鲜计划的普遍的不平静的心情并没有平息下来。不管他是否知道，时间正在逼迫着这位国务卿。
    国务卿想在全线保持冷战的压力，指望苏联人不是投降就是崩溃。这不是一种政策；这是一种既定不变的主张。杜勒斯先生满怀信心地指望——他在全国新闻俱乐部重新表示了他的信心——苏维埃制度会由于“一种致命的弱点”而崩溃，而这种“致命的弱点”的意思就是说这种制度不能赢得较年轻的一代人的心。
    因此，非常合乎逻辑的是，杜勒斯先生是不打算缓和紧张局势的，如果他能避免这样做的话。对他说来，这不是一个条件是否有利的问题；不管在什么条件下就基本问题进行谈判都将是一个错误。人们是不会和一个有“致命弱点”和肯定要崩溃——正如杜勒斯先生爽快地告诉我们的，如果这不是下星期的事、那末也是“十年或者一代人”以内的事——的对手进行谈判的。基本上说来，正如自由派民主党人很不愉快地开始发现的那样，这也是艾奇逊先生的主张；事实上，他们目前的问题是使他们自己同艾奇逊先生“不再发生关系”。那末，杜勒斯和艾奇逊的主张中的“致命弱点”恰恰是，这种主张是以一种得不到过去十年的经验的支持的假定的想法为基础的。（2月1日）
