Xinhua News Agency, New York: Some American economists are deeply concerned that the American economic recession is neither temporary nor easily stopped.

　　New York dispatch, the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress began hearing opinions on the "Economic Report" submitted by the US President to Congress. At the January 29th meeting, most speakers believed that the US economic recession was more serious than indicated in the President's message to Congress. They disagreed with the notion that the recession was only a temporary phenomenon and expressed doubts about the idea that increased military spending could stop the recession.

　　Stanley Ruttenberg, chief economist of the AFL-CIO, accused Eisenhower at the hearing of playing political tricks by predicting in his report that the economy would improve in the middle of this year. He said that such predictions were nothing more than "subjective ideas containing dangerous political deception." Ruttenberg demanded that the US government no longer ignore reality but should take measures such as reducing the tax burden on middle- and lower-income families to prevent further economic recession.

　　According to the "New York Times," economists also doubted the accuracy of the President's estimate that residential construction and expenditures by state and local authorities would help improve the economic situation this year. The newspaper emphasized that economists believe that the main reason for the recession is the reduction in investment in factory construction and equipment. Obviously, the factors contributing to the recession will continue to have an effect throughout 1958.

　　Economist Comm of the "National Planning Association" believes that the plan proposed by the President is "insufficient and therefore cannot prevent the recession of business activities in the near future."

　　Harvard University economist Duesenberry believes that if increased military orders cannot make up for the reduction in investment in new industrial enterprises and equipment, then production and income will continue to decline in the future, and "the depression will be even more serious."

　　Professor Rasmussen of Utah State University emphasized that the possibility of a more serious economic recession is now clearly greater than in 1949 or 1953-54.

　　Financial commentator Rutter wrote in the "New York Times" that American business people are increasingly worried about discussing a question: will the United States have another crisis as serious as that of 1929? The author wrote: "As the recession of business activities becomes more and more serious, this worrying question has become the focus of everyone's attention. When the Joint Economic Committee of the two houses of Congress began discussing the US business situation on the 29th, this situation was particularly obvious in Washington. According to most people, the business situation is very dangerous."

　　In addition, economists at the US Department of Labor predict that the total number of unemployed people in the United States will increase to 4.3 million to 4.5 million in January of this year (3.4 million in December of last year).

### 一些美国经济学家忧心忡忡  美国经济衰退既非暂时亦难制止

　　一些美国经济学家忧心忡忡
    美国经济衰退既非暂时亦难制止
    新华社讯　纽约消息，美国国会两院联席经济委员会开始就美国总统向国会提出的“经济报告”听取意见。1月29日会议上大多数发言的人都认为，美国经济衰退的情况比总统给国会的咨文中所指出的还严重。他们不同意说衰退只是暂时的现象，并且对所谓增加军费开支就能够制止衰退的说法表示怀疑。
    产联—劳联首席经济学家斯坦莱·鲁顿伯格在意见听取会上指责艾森豪威尔在报告中预言经济会在今年年中好转是玩弄政治手段。他说，这种预言不过“是含有危险的政治欺骗的主观的想法”。鲁顿伯格要求美国政府再不要漠视现实，而应当采取像减低中下层收入的家庭的税捐负担这样的办法来防止经济衰退进一步发展。
    据“纽约时报”报道，经济学家也怀疑总统下面这种估计的正确性，总统曾经说，住宅建设以及各州当局和地方当局的开支将有助于改善今年的经济状况。报纸强调指出，经济学家们认为，衰退的主要原因是对工厂建设和设备的投资减少。显然，促成衰退的因素在1958年全年还要继续发生作用。
    “全国计划协会”的经济学家科姆认为，总统提出的计划是“不够的，因此不能在最近期间内阻止商业活动的衰退”。
    哈佛大学经济学家杜森贝雷认为，如果增加军事定货不能弥补对新工业企业和设备的投资的减少，那么，生产和收入今后就还要下降，而且“萧条将会更加严重”。
    犹他州立大学教授拉斯穆森强调指出，发生更为严重的经济衰退的可能性，现在显然要比1949年或者1953—54年更大。
    金融评论员腊特在“纽约时报”上发表文章说，美国商界人士越来越忧心忡忡地在讨论一个问题：美国会不会再来一次像1929年那样严重的危机。作者写道：“当商业活动的衰退现象日益严重的时候，这个令人发愁的问题就成为目前大家注意的中心。当29日国会两院联席经济委员会开始讨论美国商业状况的时候，在华盛顿就特别明显地看出这种情形。据大多数人认为，商业情况是非常危险的。”
    此外，美国劳工部的经济学家预测，今年1月份美国的失业总人数将增加到四百三十万到四百五十万（去年12月是三百四十万人）。
