    A Spring Bouquet
    Fushi
    It is Spring
    It is Spring – Winter is over,
    It is morning – not dusk,
    When the bright sky lifts up rosy clouds,
    Under heaven, a giant stirs.
    Giant, stride forth,
    A myriad miles in a step, crossing the sea to the west;
    The east wind is infinitely good – blowing away the cold,
    The sea is extremely happy – celebrating the sunrise.
    Where are you?
    Where are you? Already out the door?
    Visiting relatives and friends? Congratulating them on the New Year!
    What will you do this year? May everything go as you wish!
    Alright, let's catch up with and surpass Britain's industrial output in fifteen years.
    Are there difficulties? Of course;
    Poverty and blankness are precisely good for a great turnaround,
    Even the desert blooming red flowers – that's amazing,
    Building a large factory and mine in two days – a city appearing in two nights!
    Didn't sleep all night
    Didn't sleep all night, eyes not tired,
    What a wonderful mood, what beautiful lights,
    Are you reveling? Still talking freely:
    Five years looking like three, three years looking like the beginning of spring!
    Never again will there be! Despair and boredom.
    Only astonishment at the huge and magnificent scale;
    When confident cheers awaken you,
    You then realize, the cheers come from your mouth.
    Quickly welcome
    Stop the nonsense, quickly welcome the arrival of bright happiness,
    Has it arrived? Need you even ask!?…
    Aren't you carrying the challenge letter, banging gongs and drums?
    Yes! It is, accelerating to bring everything to us.
    Kiss wildly! Closely touching the lips of the era,
    Leap forward, with the feet bringing along the entire nation-state,
    When tomorrow, bright and splendid, shines upon us,
    Certainly! We will grasp our destiny and the world even more firmly.

    春天一束
    俯拾
    是春天
    是春天——冬季已尽，
    是清早——不是黄昏，
    当明媚的天升起红云，
    天底下，耸动着一位巨人。
    巨人啊，迈开大步，
    一步万里、跨海西征；
    东风无限好——吹去寒冷，
    大海乐极了——欢送太阳初升。
    你在那里
    你在那里呢？已经出门？
    拜访亲友吧？恭贺新春！
    今年干什么？事事如意！
    好吧，让我们十五年工业产量赶过英国的水准。
    有困难吗？自然；
    一穷二白正好大翻身，
    连沙漠也大放红花、这才希奇，
    两天建成一个大厂矿——两夜出现一座城！
    通夜没睡
    通夜没睡、眼睛不困，
    多好的心情、多美的灯，
    你在狂欢吧？还在畅谈：
    五年看三年、三年看头春！
    再不会有的了！绝望烦闷。
    只有对巨大宏伟的规模出神；
    当有把握的欢呼把你惊醒，
    你才知道、欢声是从你嘴里发生。
    快迎接
    别废话，快迎接光明幸福的来临，
    来了吗？还用问！？……
    你不是敲锣打鼓抬着挑战书？
    对！就是它，加快把一切带给我们。
    狂吻吧！紧贴着时代的嘴唇，
    飞跃吧，连民族国家一齐带起的脚跟，
    当明天、光辉灿烂照耀我们时，
    一定！我们会把命运和世界掌握的更稳。
