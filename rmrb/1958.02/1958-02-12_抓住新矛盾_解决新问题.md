Grasping New Contradictions and Solving New Problems
    Wan Xiangxin

To vigorously develop the transportation industry with a revolutionary spirit, and gradually liberate millions of rural laborers from the backward transportation of manual carrying, is a new measure recently proposed by Sichuan Province to ensure the great leap forward in agricultural production.

Millions of rural laborers busy with shoulder carrying and human back carrying is a long-standing backward phenomenon in old China. Although farmers had extreme aversion to "carrying everything on their shoulders, spending half their lives on the road," they had no ability to change this situation in the past. When feudal rule and small-scale private ownership still existed, this was not a prominent contradiction in rural areas. Now, with the basic completion of agricultural collectivization, the newly liberated rural productive forces are galloping forward like wild horses. This backward mode of transportation appears to be hindering progress, becoming a rather acute contradiction in the current great leap forward in agriculture. According to a survey by the Sichuan Provincial Transportation Department, 1.2 million rural laborers across the province are now busy with shoulder carrying and human back carrying every day; in mountainous areas such as Cangxi County, the labor force used for transportation accounts for one-third of the total local labor force. Throughout the country, especially in mountainous areas and southern provinces, the labor force used for this backward transportation is a considerable figure. Releasing these laborers and putting them into water conservancy construction and intensive cultivation will add a huge force to the great leap forward in agriculture!

The fact that Sichuan Province promptly discovered this contradiction and proposed a solution demonstrates the relevant leadership's sensitivity to new problems and its proactive spirit in supporting agriculture. Now, when agriculture is leading the way like a fast horse, it will inevitably make new demands on relevant departments. Some of these demands are obvious. For example, after agriculture takes a big step forward, the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry and the fertilizer industry must quickly catch up. However, some demands are not so quick or obvious, and often gradually emerge with the development of work and the situation. For the former, we must of course seize and solve them in a timely manner; for the latter, we cannot ignore them either. For example, although the backwardness of transportation has less direct impact on the agricultural leap forward than irrigation and drainage machinery and fertilizers, it is now wasting a lot of labor, and this contradiction will intensify soon after a large number of machines are sent to the countryside and agricultural and sideline industries are greatly developed. For another example, the machinery industry department is now rushing to produce a large number of agricultural machines. As these machines are gradually sent to the countryside, there will be problems such as insufficient rural technical forces and the need for a large supply of fuel. There are many similar problems. If the relevant departments do not proactively discover and solve these problems in a timely manner, it may hinder the pace of agricultural progress and put their work in a passive position. If these tasks are done well, the business of the relevant departments will also take on a new look. Isn't the approach of the Sichuan Provincial Transportation Department not only supporting agriculture, but also enabling the transportation industry to achieve a great leap forward?

Reading the news of Sichuan Province's decision to vigorously develop water and land transportation, we can "infer the other three corners from one." To be far-sighted and thoughtful, and proactively study and solve the various new problems and new contradictions brought about by the great leap forward in agriculture, to support each other and leap forward together – this is an important new task for the current industrial and transportation departments.

    抓住新矛盾  解决新问题
    万向辛
    以革命的精神大力发展交通运输事业，把千百万农村劳动力逐步从人力挑、背的落后运输中解放出来，这是四川省最近为保证农业生产大跃进提出的一个新措施。
    千万农村劳力忙于肩挑、人背，是旧中国长期存在的一种落后现象。农民们虽然对“样样东西用肩挑，半世工夫路上跑”有极大的反感，但是过去他们没有能力改变这种状况。当封建统治和小私有制还存在的时候，这也不是农村的突出的矛盾。现在，农业合作化基本完成了，新解放了的农村生产力犹如脱缰之马向前急驰，这种落后的运输方式便显得碍手碍脚起来，在目前的农业大跃进中，成为一个相当尖锐的矛盾。据四川省交通部门调查，全省现在每天有一百二十万个农村劳动力奔忙于肩挑、人背的运输；苍溪县等山区用于运输的劳力，竟占当地全部劳力的三分之一。全国各地，特别是山区和南方各省用于这种落后运输的劳动力，是一个可观的数字。把这些劳动力解放出来，投入水利建设和精耕细作，将会为农业大跃进增加一支巨大的力量！
    四川省及时发现这一矛盾，提出解决的办法，表现了有关领导方面对新问题的敏感，对支援农业的主动精神。现在当农业像一匹快马一样领先奔驰的时候，它必然会向有关部门不断提出一些新的要求。这些要求有的是显而易见的。例如，农业跨大步子以后，农业机械制造工业和肥料工业就要迅速赶上去。但是，有些要求表现出来的就不是那么快、那么明显，往往要随着工作和形势的发展才逐渐显露出来。对于前者，我们当然要及时抓住及时解决；对于后者，却也不能忽视。例如，交通运输的落后状况对于农业跃进的影响，虽然不如排灌机械、肥料那么直接，但是现在它已经在浪费着大量劳动力，不久机械大量下乡和农副业大发展以后，这一矛盾还会加剧。又如，机械工业部门现在正在赶制大批农业机械，随着这些机械陆续下乡，就将会出现农村技术力量不足、需要大量供应燃料等问题。类似这样的问题还有很多。有关部门如果不及时主动地去发现和解决这些问题，那就可能会妨碍农业前进的步伐，并使自己的工作陷于被动。而作好了这些工作，有关部门的业务也将会面貌一新。四川省交通部门的作法，不是既支援了农业，又可以使运输事业同样来个大跃进吗？
    读了四川省决定大力发展水陆交通的消息，可以“举一隅而三隅反”。要目光四射，深谋远虑，及时主动地去研究和解决农业大跃进所带来的各种新问题、新矛盾，互相支援，共同跃进——这是当前工业交通等部门的一个重要的新课题。
