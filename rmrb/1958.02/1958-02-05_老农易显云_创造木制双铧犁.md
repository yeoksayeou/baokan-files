　　Old Farmer Yi Xianyun
    Creates Wooden Double-Share Plow
    (Our dispatch) The wooden double-share plow created by Yi Xianyun, an old farmer from the Huochetou Agricultural Cooperative in PingShan County, a remote mountainous area of Sichuan, has been tested and evaluated by the agricultural leadership department of Yibin Special District. It is considered suitable for operation in small mountain fields, can plow on both sides, turns conveniently, and its efficiency is generally about 70% higher than that of a wooden single-share plow. The PingShan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party plans to convert all existing old-fashioned single-share plows in the county into wooden double-share plows within the next five years. After full-scale promotion, it can save 300,000 labor days a year, and also save 50-60% of the cattle power.

　　老农易显云
    创造木制双铧犁
    本报讯　四川边远山区屏山县火车头农业社老农易显云创制的木制双铧犁，经宜宾专区农业领导部门试验鉴定，认为适宜山区小块田间操作，能两面犁，转弯方便，功效一般比木制单铧犁提高70％左右。中共屏山县委准备在今后五年内把全县现有旧式单铧犁，全部改为木制双铧犁。全面推广后，一年就可以节省三十万个劳动日，还可节省50—60％的牛力。
