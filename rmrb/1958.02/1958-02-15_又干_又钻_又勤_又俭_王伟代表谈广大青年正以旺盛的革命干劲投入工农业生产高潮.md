I completely agree with the reports made to the congress by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Here, I would like to reflect on the drive of Chinese youth in the socialist high tide and their determination to catch up with England.

Our youth have a glorious revolutionary tradition. They are a powerful shock force in revolutionary struggles and the vanguard of socialist construction. After this nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, which is to say the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, the fighting spirit of the broad masses of youth is even more high-spirited, and they are throwing themselves into the high tide of production with vigorous revolutionary drive.

Seizing Time and Opposing Waste to Leave England Behind

Youthful Workers Are Exerting the Effort of One Day Equals Ten

Striving to catch up with or surpass England in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer is most encouraging to young workers. This slogan is like a magnet, guiding them to work heroically for a bright future. During this period, the most prominent actions of young workers are, first, to seize time, and second, to oppose waste. They say they want to "exert the effort of one day equals ten, one year equals ten years, and leave England behind." The "Youth Steelmaking Furnace" of the Shanghai Machine Repair General Factory launched a revolutionary competition, and their slogan is: "Time is steel." In just over half a month, they continuously set twelve new records in shortening steelmaking time. In a competition at the end of last year, young miners in Fuxin and Fushun increased coal production by 140,000 tons in one month. A young advanced producer in Shanghai named Li Huashan completed fifteen years' worth of work during the first Five-Year Plan period, and now he has stepped into the fourth Five-Year Plan. In order to plug all loopholes of waste, many young workers have launched "investigation, calculation, and searching" saving activities. Young workers at the Shenyang Smelting Plant have saved more than 1.26 million yuan on the basis of saving 10,000 taels of gold in the past. Now the Communist Youth League committees in various places are organizing young people to dig out all waste phenomena with a fierce and aggressive spirit. After socialist education through great airing of views, great contending, great debate, and great character posters, apprentices now consciously support the provisions of the new apprenticeship system promulgated by the State Council. They reflect that this provision has four major benefits: it can improve technical level, strengthen ideological awareness, enhance the unity of new and old workers, and reduce the blind influx of rural youth into cities, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

Wherever There Is Difficulty, Take the Lead

Rural Youth Organize Mountain Construction Teams

Here, I want to especially emphasize the role of rural youth in the great leap forward in agricultural production in our country. They are indeed full of energy in water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, soil improvement, mountain construction, afforestation, and the elimination of the four pests. "Wherever there is difficulty, take the lead." In water conservancy construction, they said very heroically, "We will not stop working when the ice freezes two feet thick, and we will not be discouraged when the snow falls two feet thick," "Go out early, come back late, and do not withdraw until the task is completed." Some people shrank back when they encountered rocks while digging wells in the mountains, but the youth shock team insisted on continuing, saying, "We will drill through the earth to get water out," and as a result, they truly turned the "impossible" into possible and the possible into reality. The youths in Wushan County, Gansu, who built the Dongliang Canal, were called "Tiger Team" and "Iron Teenagers" by the masses, as reported in the newspapers. The saline-alkali land of Laotapo in Neihuang County, Henan, was said to be a hopeless land that could not be cured by any dynasty from ancient times to the present, but after an attack by the fourteen youth shock teams of the county's seven hundred and thirty-five shock team members, four hundred and thirty acres of land were opened, forty wells were dug, sixty-five soil dams were built, two orchards were planted, more than sixty-six thousand trees were planted, and two large reservoirs were built, one of which can hold 108,000 cubic meters of water. Recently, the youth mountain basic construction teams that have appeared in many places are a very good form for developing mountainous areas. Because the mountains are high and the roads are far away, and the living conditions are more difficult, mobilizing young people to go there reduces difficulties, because young people generally have no family burdens, they are energetic, and they can endure hunger and cold. They are all "newborn calves who are not afraid of tigers." This kind of youth mountain basic construction team is beneficial to both the construction of mountainous areas and the training of youth: first, under the unified planning of agricultural cooperatives, construction is carried out year-round and maintained year-round, resolving the contradiction between farmland production and basic construction; second, it is easy to learn and master professional techniques; third, it can give full play to the shock role of youth; and fourth, it encourages and strengthens the confidence of the masses in mountainous areas to build their hometowns. At present, there are about 55,000 such shock teams across the country, including 10,000 in Gansu province alone. In addition, rural youth have played a great role in eliminating illiteracy, eliminating the four pests, and popularizing culture. The Liaoning Provincial Communist Youth League organization has decided to basically eliminate illiteracy among all rural youth in the province by next year, nine years ahead of the Agricultural Development Program.

Politics Plus Technology, Drive Plus Diligence: Combining Heroic Spirit with Mastery of Technology

In order to mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of young people and resolutely be promoters of our cause, we must continue to deepen the socialist education of young people and launch a trend of hard work, diligence in study, industry, and frugality among young people. With these two trends, the youth of our country will shine even more brilliantly. The heroic spirit of Chinese youth in labor is very valuable, but it must be combined with the mastery of technology. In the construction period, if young people do not master technology, it is like fighting without weapons. Only with politics plus technology, drive plus diligence, can we truly achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, and promote the great leap forward in production. At present, there are 100,000 youth planting groups and 150,000 youth experimental fields across the country. They are pioneers in learning and promoting advanced technology. After several years of experimentation, they have created many high-yield records. The experimental fields of the youth production team of Shunjiang Cooperative in Neijiang County, Sichuan, created a new record of 3,788 catties per mu. Last year, the cadres of the Communist Youth League in Macheng County, Hubei Province, established 2,000 experimental fields, and 23,792 members of the Communist Youth League and young people participated, creating a high-yield record of 1,810.4 catties per mu for two crops of cotton and wheat (1,270.4 catties of seed cotton and 540 catties of wheat), 1,860 catties per mu for double-season rice, and 25,000 catties per mu for sweet potatoes. Originally, the masses saw them and called them "Mr.," saying that they "eat lime - a white mouth, only know how to brag." After they made a model, everyone called them comrades. Running experimental fields is a good way for young cadres to learn production, participate in production, and lead production. Now the Communist Youth League committees in various places are generally promoting this method. We have also decided to encourage young people in rural areas to learn these technologies in accordance with the principles of adapting to local conditions and learning while working: such as creating high yields, cultivating cash crops, planting trees, protecting and raising livestock, cultivating and improving varieties, building small-scale water conservancy projects, improving soil, preventing pests and diseases, operating new agricultural tools, and preventing common diseases. Among young workers in industrial and mining enterprises, technical activities with learning and promoting advanced experience as the main content should also be carried out to improve the technical level and operational ability of the broad masses of young workers. We must strive to make this generation of young people in our country new types of laborers with communist consciousness and a certain level of cultural and technical expertise.

Educate Young People to Build the Country with Diligence and Thrift and Manage Their Households with Diligence and Thrift

Achieve Economy for Everyone and Economy in Everything

Because young people are young, do not manage households, and do not know how to live, coupled with our insufficient education, for a period of time, some young people developed a bad habit, liking to compare with others in terms of clothing and ostentation in life, rather than comparing with others in terms of labor, learning, and ambition. Some young people spend all their annual wages on one marriage, and some young women look for partners, not looking at other conditions, but only seeking enjoyment in life. After this socialist education and the influence of cadres going to the countryside and mountains, this trend is rapidly changing. The broad masses of young people are gradually realizing that to build the motherland, they must work hard and be ambitious revolutionary youth. Recently, many young people in factories and mines have treated rectification as masters, resolutely not waiting for what they can change themselves, and never standing by and watching what they can do themselves. If there is waste, they must eliminate it. We must seize this good opportunity to educate young people to build the country with diligence and thrift, manage their households with diligence and thrift, make careful calculations, and live a good life, achieving frugality for everyone and frugality in everything. As long as we launch a trend of hard work, diligence in study, industry, and frugality among young people, and every young person is willing to work hard and study diligently, and can be industrious and frugal, the youth of our country will definitely make greater contributions to the great leap forward in various tasks of the second Five-Year Plan.

    又干  又钻  又勤  又俭
    王伟代表谈广大青年正以旺盛的革命干劲投入工农业生产高潮
    我完全同意李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理、吴玉章主任向大会所作的报告。在这里，我想反映一下我国青年在社会主义高潮中的那股干劲和一心要赶上英国的决心。
    我国青年有着光荣的革命传统。他们是革命斗争中一支有力的突击部队，是社会主义建设事业的急先锋。经过这次全民整风和反右派斗争，也就是政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，广大青年的斗志更为昂扬，正以旺盛的革命干劲投入生产高潮。
    抢时间反浪费把英国抛在后面
    青年职工拿出一天顶十天的干劲
    争取在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，最使青年职工感到鼓舞。这个口号就像一块磁铁一样，引导他们为了灿烂的未来而英勇劳动。这段时间，青年职工最突出的行动，一是抢时间，二是反浪费。他们说要“拿出一天顶十天，一年顶十年的干劲，把英国抛在后面。”上海机修总厂的“青年炼钢炉”展开了革命竞赛，他们的口号是：“时间就是钢”，半个多月工夫在缩短炼钢时间上，就连续创造了十二次新纪录。阜新和抚顺两地的青年矿工，在去年年底一场竞赛中，一个月就增产了十四万吨煤。上海有个名叫李华山的青年先进生产者，在第一个五年计划期间完成了十五年的工作量，现在他已跨进了第四个五年计划的大门。许多青年职工为了堵塞一切浪费漏洞，展开了“查、算、找”的节约活动，沈阳冶炼厂青年职工在过去节约了万两黄金的基础上，又节约了一百二十六万余元。现在各地团委正在组织青年，以一股猛攻猛打的劲头，把一切浪费现象都挖掘出来。徒工们经过大鸣、大放、大争、大辩论的社会主义教育，现在都自觉地拥护国务院公布的新学徒制度的规定，他们反映这个规定有四大好处：可以提高技术水平，可以加强思想意识的锻炼，可以增强新老工人的团结，可以减少农村青年盲目流入城市，巩固工农联盟。
    哪里有困难　哪里带头干
    农村青年组织山区建设队
    这里，我要特别着重地谈谈我国农村青年在农业生产大跃进中的作用。他们在兴修水利、积肥、改良土壤、建设山区、植树造林、除四害运动中，的确浑身是劲。“哪里有困难，哪里带头干”，他们在兴修水利中，十分豪迈地说“冰冻二尺不停工，雪下二尺不灰心”，“早出勤，晚收工，完不成任务不收兵”，有的人在山地打井碰到石头时畏缩不前，青年突击队员还是坚持下去，说“把地球打透也要打出水来”，结果真是把“不可能”变成可能，把可能变成了现实。报纸上登载过的甘肃武山县修建东梁渠的青年们，就被群众称为“老虎队”、“铁少年”。河南内黄县老塔坡的沙碱地，人们一提起它，就说是从古到今多少朝代治不了的绝地，但经过这个县十四个青年突击队七百三十五个突击队员的突击，居然在沙碱地开了四百三十亩田，打了四十眼井，筑了六十五条土埂，种了两个果木园，植了六万六千多棵树，还修建了两个大蓄水池，其中一个就可蓄水十万八千立方。最近许多地方出现的青年山区基本建设队，是开发山区一个很好的形式。由于山高路远，生活条件较苦，动员青年前去，困难就少得多了，这是因为青年们一般都没有家室之累，干劲大，能忍饥耐寒，都是些“初生之犊不怕虎”的人。这种青年山区基建队对建设山区、锻炼青年都有好处：一是在农业社统一规划下，常年施工，常年维护，解决了农田生产与基本建设的矛盾；二是便于学习和掌握专业技术；三是能充分发挥青年的突击作用；四是鼓舞和坚定了山区群众建设家乡的信心。现在，这种突击队在全国约有五万五千个，其中甘肃一省就有一万个。此外，农村青年在扫除文盲、除四害普及文化等工作中都发挥了很大的作用，辽宁省团的组织，已决定在明年把全省农村青年文盲基本扫除，比农业发展纲要提前九年完成扫除农村青年文盲的任务。
    政治加技术　干劲加钻劲  把英勇气概和掌握技术结合起来
    为了把青年的社会主义积极性调动起来，坚决做我们事业的促进派，我们必须继续深入青年的社会主义教育，在青年中掀起又干又钻、又勤又俭之风。有了这两股风，我国青年身上将会放出更加灿烂的光彩。我国青年在劳动中的那种英勇气概，是非常可贵的，但是还必须把英勇气概和掌握技术结合起来。在建设时期，青年不掌握技术，就等于打仗没有武器。只有政治加技术，干劲加钻劲，才能真正做到多快好省，推动生产的大跃进。现在全国有青年种植小组十万个，青年试验田十五万块，他们是学习和推广先进技术的先锋。经过几年的试验，他们创造了许多高额丰产纪录，四川内江县顺江社的青年生产队所搞的试验田，创造了亩产粮食三千七百八十八斤的新纪录。湖北省麻城县团的干部去年建立了二千个试验田，有二万三千七百九十二个团员和青年参加，创造了棉麦两熟地亩产一千八百一十点四斤（籽棉一千二百七十点四斤，小麦五百四十斤）、双季水稻亩产一千八百六十斤、红薯亩产二万五千斤的高产纪录。原来，群众看见他们称先生，说他们“口吃石灰——一张白嘴，只会夸海话”，在他们搞出了样板以后，大家就叫他们同志了，搞试验田是青年干部学习生产、参加生产、领导生产的好办法，现在各地团委正在普遍推广这个办法。我们还决定在农村青年中按照因人因地制宜和边作边学的原则，提倡学会这几种技术：如创造高额产量、栽培经济作物、种植林木、保护和饲养牲畜、培植和改良品种、兴修小型水利、改良土壤、防止病虫害、操作新式农具、防止一般疾病的知识和技术。在工矿企业的青年职工中，也要开展以学习和推广先进经验为主要内容的技术活动，来提高广大青年职工的技术水平和操作能力。我们要努力使我国这代青年成为有共产主义觉悟和一定文化技术水平的新型劳动者。
    教育青年勤俭建国勤俭持家
    做到人人节俭事事节俭
    青年人由于年轻，不当家，不会过日子，加上我们教育不够，有一个时期，曾有一部分青年滋长了一种不好的风气，喜欢在生活上和人比穿戴、比排场，而不是和人比劳动、比学习、比志气。有些青年结一次婚就花掉自己一年的全部工资，有些女青年找对象，不看别的条件，只图生活享受。经过这次社会主义教育和干部下乡上山的影响，这种风气正在迅速转变，广大青年逐渐认识到要建设祖国，就必须艰苦奋斗，做一个有志气的革命青年。最近许多厂矿青年，都以主人翁的态度对待整改，自己能改的决不等待，自己能办的决不旁观，有了浪费就一定要反掉。我们一定要抓住这个良好时机，教育青年勤俭建国、勤俭持家、精打细算，过好日子，做到人人节俭，事事节俭。只要我们在青年中掀起又干又钻、又勤又俭之风，个个青年都肯干肯钻、能勤能俭，我国青年就一定会在第二个五年计划的各项工作的大跃进中做出更大的贡献。
