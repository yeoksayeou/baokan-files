Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd: The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League convened a symposium on February 1st, gathering Communist Youth League cadres from twelve middle schools in Shenyang and responsible persons from the League's district committees to study the issue of promoting work-study programs among students.

The cadres who attended the symposium believed that there is great potential for carrying out work-study programs in cities. Cities have many large, medium, and small factories, various construction sites, and a large number of service industries, all of which are good places for students to participate in labor and training. In fact, many students have already voluntarily participated in these areas. For example, since the summer vacation of 1957, Shenyang No. 28 Middle School has had more than seventy students participating in social labor. Some worked as temporary mechanical packaging workers in factories, some worked as temporary material clerks on construction sites, some worked as bricklayers and earth movers, and some became milk delivery workers and barbers. Currently, a large number of students from Shenyang No. 14 Middle School are working at the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, transporting metal powder; Shenyang No. 37 Middle School once sent more than sixty students from the school to construction sites to work as temporary laborers. These students who work in factories and construction sites have received a considerable amount of compensation, which has solved the problem of school fees. A student named Yao Juzhong, due to his labor income, was once changed from a fully-funded student to a partially-funded student.

The symposium also considered that carrying out service-oriented labor on campus is an important aspect of work-study programs. The person in charge of Shenyang Hui Nationality Middle School said that they initially thought it was not very meaningful to establish barbering, carpentry, and sewing teams in the school. However, after discussing it with the school's general affairs department, they changed their minds. Among the school's 1,600 students, there are 1,200 boys. Calculating that each person spends two jiao per month for a haircut, the school's male students would spend 2,880 yuan per year; the school also spends about 800 yuan per year on repairing desks, chairs, doors, and windows. If these service-oriented labor tasks are undertaken by the students, it can save the school's expenses, cultivate students' labor habits, and enable some students to earn some income. The school has recently established a school-wide "Work-Study Corps." In just a few days, the carpentry team has repaired 44 desks and 41 chairs for the school. The students of the barbering team have already started giving haircuts to classmates and teachers.

The person in charge of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League requested at the symposium that the League organizations of all middle schools in Shenyang should actively find ways, continue to seek opportunities, and carry out work-study activities throughout the city in a planned and step-by-step manner in the future.

　　城市里勤工俭学有很大潜力
    沈阳市中学团组织将积极展开活动
    据新华社沈阳3日电　共青团沈阳市委员会1日召集沈阳市十二所中学的共青团干部和团的各区委会负责人举行座谈会，研究在学生中提倡勤工俭学的问题。
    参加座谈会的干部们认为，在城市里开展勤工俭学活动有很大潜力。城市里有许多大、中、小型工厂，各种建筑工地和大量的服务性行业，这些都是学生参加劳动锻炼的良好场所。实际上，目前有许多学生已经自动地参加了这些方面的工作。如沈阳市第二十八中学，从1957年暑假到现在，先后有七十多名学生参加了社会劳动。有的做了工厂的临时机械包装工，有的做了建筑工地临时材料员，有的做了瓦工和挑土工，还有的成了送牛奶工人和理发工人。沈阳市第十四中学目前有大批学生在沈阳机床二厂里做金属粉的搬运工作；沈阳市第三十七中学曾经把校里六十多名学生送到建筑工地做临时工。这些在工厂、工地从事劳动的学生都得到了相当数量的报酬，解决了学杂费的问题。一个叫姚鞠中的学生，因为有了劳动收入，曾经由全免费生变成了半免费生。
    座谈中还认为，在校内开展服务性劳动，也是勤工俭学的重要方面。沈阳市回民中学负责人说，他们最初认为在学校中成立理发、木工、缝纫等队没有多大意义。可是同学校总务部门一研究，就改变了这种想法。全校一千六百名学生中男生有一千二百人，按每人每月剪一次头、支出两角钱计算，全校男学生每年就要支出二千八百八十元；学校每年用于修理桌椅门窗的费用也要八百元左右。如果这些服务性劳动由学生担负起来，就可以节省学校开支、培养学生的劳动习惯，并且部分学生也可因此获得一部分收入。这个学校已经在最近成立了全校性的“勤工俭学团”。木工队在短短几天里，已经给学校修好了四十四张桌子、四十一张椅子。理发队的学生已经开始给同学和老师理发了。
    共青团沈阳市委会负责人在座谈会上要求沈阳市各中学的团组织今后要积极想办法，继续找门路，有计划、有步骤地把勤工俭学活动在全市开展起来。
