After listening to Director Bo Yibo's report on the draft national economic plan for 1958 and Minister Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 national budget and the draft national budget for 1958, I deeply realized that the Party and the government adhere to the policy of increasing production and practicing economy and the measures of building the country through diligence and frugality, prioritizing urgent matters, and actively developing. I wholeheartedly support these two reports. I would now like to speak to the conference on how to develop sericulture to increase cocoon production in the implementation of agricultural development.

The second article of the "National Agricultural Development Program, 1956-1967" proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China states: "Under the condition of prioritizing the development of grain production, all localities should develop a diversified rural economy to ensure the completion of the state-prescribed plan targets for textile raw materials (cotton, hemp, silkworm cocoons) ... " Indeed, silkworm cocoons are the raw material for silk, and silk has always been an important export commodity of our country and is also needed by the broad masses of the people for clothing. After liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government, silk production has greatly exceeded the level before liberation. However, domestic and foreign sales are far from meeting the demand, so the silk industry should be vigorously developed. I would like to express my views on the scope of sericulture promotion and sericulture education as follows:

Promote to Mountainous Areas and Low-Yield Grain Areas

First, to develop the silk industry, mulberry trees must be planted. To promote mulberry planting, there must be land. Recently, due to the increasing need for grain, it is no longer appropriate to promote mulberry planting in high-yield grain areas. Only by promoting mulberry planting in mountainous areas and low-yield grain areas can the requirements be met. In recent years, Jiangsu Province has massively planted mulberry trees following this policy, which is very correct. However, in dry fields, intercropping mulberry forests at very far distances, with deep roots and tall trees, will not hinder mechanized farming, nor will it affect grain production, and can be sustained and save the cost of mulberry tree cultivation. Therefore, those who do not seek quick results can also promote mulberry planting in dry fields.

Also, planting mulberry trees in warm areas yields the fastest harvest. For example, in Guangdong Province, in addition to the professional sericulture in the Shunde District, other areas, under the condition of prioritizing the development of grain production, can promote mulberry planting as a sideline and raise hybridized silkworm varieties two or three times in spring and autumn, the harvest will be huge, and it seems appropriate to select areas for trial implementation.

Second, future mulberry planting must emphasize yield per unit area. If the yield per unit area of mulberry is high, the cost of silkworm rearing can be reduced. As to how to increase the yield per unit area of mulberry, it obviously depends on technology and fertilizer. Mulberry planting experts in Wuxi can feed as many as three and a half silkworm egg sheets per mu of mulberry land throughout the year, producing up to two shi dan of cocoons. This advanced experience should be promoted. The source of fertilizer, although problematic in agricultural development, chemical fertilizer production is developing rapidly. This year, some mulberry planting areas have even obtained chemical fertilizers to supplement the inadequacy of natural fertilizers. However, the application method of chemical fertilizers is closely related to soil climate and crops, so it is necessary to conscientiously publicize appropriate application methods to prevent waste and inefficiency. Further, it is recommended to produce comprehensive fertilizers dedicated to crops, such as Japan's Mulberry No. 2 chemical fertilizer, which is a dedicated fertilizer for mulberry trees for young silkworms, which seems more convenient and economical.

In areas where sericulture is already flourishing, if mulberry trees are old, weak, and unable to produce, they should be immediately moved, merged, supplemented, or completely replanted to achieve increased production through decisive renewal.

Third, today's promotion of mulberry planting relies entirely on the planning of cooperatives. In sericultural areas, cooperatives should earnestly include mulberry planting and silkworm rearing in agricultural production plans, because past agricultural production was individual, but today it is collective. Since collectivization, experience in collective planning for grain production has gradually been gained. Collective planning for sericulture sidelines is of course inexperienced, so today's promotion of sericulture should focus on the production plans of agricultural cooperatives.

Breed and Promote Superior Silkworm Varieties

First, silkworm rearing requires superior silkworm varieties to increase the benefits of the silk industry and improve the quality of silk. After liberation, the physical quality of silkworm varieties has generally been strengthened. The cocoon quality of silkworm varieties has not yet met the requirements of silkworm rearing and silk production. From the perspective of experimental research, on the one hand, as a temporary solution, superior silkworm varieties should first be collected and compared, and after experimental verification, they should be propagated and promoted. On the other hand, as a fundamental solution, it is hoped that new varieties will be continuously bred to ensure high cocoon shell ratios, long silk length, few nodes, and appropriate fineness, so as to improve raw silk quality and save silk production costs. In terms of silkworm rearing, the cocoon price can also be increased due to the high cocoon shell ratio.

Second, promoting silkworm rearing cannot but increase the benefits of silkworm rearing. To increase the benefits of silkworm rearing, the cost of silkworm rearing must be reduced. At present, the cost is difficult to reduce, so we must seek it in the cocoon price. It is recommended that relevant agencies, through investigation and research, slightly seek a reasonable adjustment, which is also one way to treat the symptoms.

Cocoon Drying and Processing Should Be Handled by Agricultural Cooperatives

The fruit of silkworm rearing is fresh cocoons. Today, the purchase of raw materials for silk production first purchases fresh cocoons, which are baked into dried cocoons, and then enter the factory for reeling. In the process of cocoon drying and processing, accidents often occur due to improper handling. Such dried cocoons cause difficulty in unwinding during silk reeling, thus increasing the cost of silk production and reducing the quality of raw silk. Therefore, the work of cocoon drying and processing should be gradually given to agricultural cooperatives, because silkworm farmers will inevitably be diligent in this work to protect the fruits of their labor. It can also achieve early cocoon drying for early cocoons and late cocoon drying for late cocoons. As a result, the cocoon quality can be preserved, and the remuneration for processing labor can also be used to increase the benefits of silkworm rearing. At the same time, the processing cost can also be saved relatively, reducing the cost of silk production. Moreover, the evaluation of cocoon prices is accurate based on dried cocoons, and the gradual implementation of dried cocoon purchase is inevitable, so processing by agricultural production cooperatives is appropriate.

Sericulture Education Should Develop Accordingly

The development of the silk industry must have corresponding sericulture education. In terms of vertical aspects, first, the sericulture and silk industry departments of universities must enrich their teaching and research equipment. Because these two specialized departments are the highest institutions of sericulture and silk, and their graduates will be sericulture and silk engineers, teachers, and researchers, they must have sufficient related instruments and machines in schools to enable education to combine theory with practice. Experimental research can often respond to the requirements of production, and teaching materials can be innovated. Second, sericulture specialized schools should be established to cultivate technical talents with a greater proportion of technology and a higher level of science, so as to master the promotion and innovation of sericulture technology. This is the focus of sericulture education. This specialized school should recruit junior high school graduates and graduate in five years. In the third and fourth academic years, its practical courses should account for at least 20% of all courses, and the fifth academic year should be entirely for production practice. According to current needs, the sericulture part should be divided into silkworm breeding and sericulture promotion departments. The silk industry part is temporarily divided into silk reeling and silk weaving departments. The number of classes in each department varies depending on the needs. However, the silkworm breeding department only needs to recruit one class nationwide each year. This specialized school can be reorganized from qualified secondary technical schools, and it is more economical to still attach secondary schools.

In terms of horizontal aspects, secondary technical education is the principle. Secondary sericulture schools specialize in training sericulture production managers for cooperatives, recruiting members of agricultural cooperatives who have graduated from junior high school (the admission level can be changed according to the actual situation), and graduating in three years (if members with sericulture experience can be recruited, they can graduate in two years). Its practical courses account for at least 20% of all courses. The number of classes depends on how many are needed. In agricultural schools, sericulture courses must be added, scheduled for one semester (the next semester), two hours (including observation), so that students can obtain sericulture concepts and take care of sericulture sidelines after returning to the cooperative. Secondary silk schools specialize in training grassroots technicians for silk factories, recruiting young workers who have graduated from junior high school, and graduating in three years. Its practical courses account for at least 20% of all courses, and the number of classes also depends on the needs.

Sericulture teaching must have corresponding practical equipment. In sericulture teaching, there should be silkworm breeding farms, mulberry fields, mulberry nurseries, silkworm and cocoon rearing rooms, and sericulture promotion experimental areas. In silk teaching, there should be silk reeling factories and silk weaving factories. In this way, students can gain production technology and management experience in practice. However, sericulture professional teachers must also absorb as much production experience as possible to be able to use these production facilities to guide students.

Whether the above is appropriate, please correct me, representatives.

　　大力发展蚕丝业　满足内用外销
    郑辟疆代表的发言
    我听了薄一波主任的一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告，及李先念部长的关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告，深深体会到党和政府，坚持增产节约的方针和勤俭建国的措施，分别先后缓急，积极发展，我衷心拥护这两个报告。我现在就实现农业发展中应如何发展蚕桑，以增产蚕茧的问题，向大会发言。
    中共中央提出的一九五六——一九六七年农业发展纲要第二条所载：“在优先发展粮食生产的条件下，各地应当发展农业的多种经济，保证完成国家所规定的纺织原料（棉花、麻类、蚕茧）……等项农作物的计划指标。”诚以蚕茧为丝绸原料，而丝绸素为我国重要输出商品，亦是广大人民衣服原料所需要的。解放后，由于党和政府之正确领导，丝绸产量已大大超过于解放前夕之水平。惟内用外销，不敷甚巨，故蚕丝业应大力发展。兹特就蚕业推广和蚕丝教育的范围，略抒所见如下。
    向山区和粮食低产区推广
    第一、发展蚕丝业，必须植桑。推广植桑，必须有土地。近因粮食需要的增加，在粮食高产区，已不宜推广植桑，只有向山区和粮食低产区推广植桑，才合要求。年来，江苏省已由此方针来大量植桑，是很正确的。但在旱田内，以很远的距离来间作桑林，则根深树高，既无碍于机耕，又不影响粮产，可以持久，可以节省桑树培养费，故不求速成者，亦可在旱田内推广植桑。
    又暖地植桑，收获最速。例如广东省，除顺德区已有专业性质的蚕桑外，其他各地，在优先发展粮食生产的条件下，能以蚕桑为副业而推广植桑，春秋饲养二化交杂蚕种两三次，则收获巨大，似宜择区试办。
    第二、今后植桑，必须讲单位产量。桑之单产量高，养蚕成本自可减轻。至如何可以提高桑之单产量，显然在于技术和肥料。无锡之栽桑能手，每亩桑地，竟能全年饲养蚕种三张半之多，产茧达两市担。此种先进经验，应予推广。至肥料之来源，在农业发展中，虽有问题，然化肥生产已在飞跃的发展。今年部分植桑区域，且已获得了化肥，以补自然肥料之不足。但化肥之施用方法，与土壤气候作物有密切之关系，宜切实宣传适当的施用方法，以防浪费失效。进一步，建议兼制作物专用的综合肥料，例如日本之桑二号化肥，为稚蚕用桑的专用肥料，似较便利而经济。
    其在原有蚕桑繁盛之区，桑树有老弱不堪而产量式微者，宜即移并补植，或全部重植，以断然更新来达成提高产量。
    第三、今日推广植桑，全赖合作社之规划。在蚕桑区域之合作社，宜将栽桑养蚕切实列入农业生产规划中，因过去的农业生产，系单干的，今日是集体的。自合作化以来，对粮食生产的集体规划，已渐有经验，对蚕桑副业的集体规划，则当然无经验，故今日推广蚕桑，要重视农业合作社的生产计划。
    繁殖推广优良蚕种
    第一、养蚕须有优良的蚕品种方可增加蚕丝业之利益，提高丝绸之品质。解放后，对蚕种之体质，已普遍强健。对蚕种之茧质，则尚未满足养蚕制丝之要求。宜由试验研究方面，一方为治标计，先采集比较优良之蚕品种，经试验证明后，予以繁殖推广。一方为治本计，希望不绝的育成新品种，务使茧层率高、丝长长、类节少、纤度适当，俾得提高生丝品质，节省制丝成本。于养蚕方面，亦得因茧层率高而提高茧价。
    第二、推广养蚕，不能不提高养蚕的利益。欲提高养蚕的利益，必须减轻养蚕的成本。目前成本尚难减轻，不能不求之于茧价。建议由有关机关，通过调查研究，稍稍求得合理的调整，是亦治标之一道。
    烘茧加工由农业社办理
    养蚕所得果实是鲜茧，今日收购制丝原料，先购入鲜茧，经焙烘为干茧，然后入厂缫丝。其烘茧加工时，常有处理不当之事故。这样的干茧，在缫丝中，发生解舒困难，制丝成本因而加重，生丝品质因而降低。故烘茧加工的工作，宜逐渐放给农业合作社办理，因蚕户为爱护其劳动果实，对此工作，必然叮咛。并可做到早茧早烘，迟茧迟烘。因之，茧质得以保全，其所得加工劳动的报酬，亦可借增养蚕上的利益。同时，加工费亦可较省，减轻了制丝成本。且茧价评定，以干茧为正确，逐步推行干茧收购，亦势所必然，故由农业生产合作社加工，是适当的。
    蚕丝教育要相应发展
    发展蚕丝业，必须有相当之蚕丝教育。在纵的方面，第一，大学蚕桑系及丝绸工业系，必须充实其教学上和研究试验上的有关设备。因这两个专系系蚕桑丝绸之最高学府，其毕业生，将是蚕桑丝绸的工程师及教师和研究人员，在学校，不能无充分的实习实验，故必须有足够的有关仪器和机器，使教育上得以理论与实际结合。试验研究上常能答复生产上之要求，而教材得以革新。第二，宜设蚕丝专科，培养技术比重较大、科学水平较高之技术人才，使掌握蚕丝技术之推广和革新。这是蚕丝教育中之重心。此项专科，应招初中毕业生。五年毕业。在第三第四两学年中，其实习课程，至少应占全部课程百分之二十，第五学年，完全为生产实习。依目前需要，蚕桑部分，应分蚕种科和蚕桑推广科。丝绸工业部分暂分制丝科和织绸科。各科班数，由需要而不同。但蚕种科只须全国每年招收一班。此项专科学校，可以由有条件的中等技术学校改组之，仍可附设中等学校，是较经济。
    横的方面，以中等技术教育为原则。在中等蚕桑学校专培养合作社之蚕桑生产管理员，招收初中毕业之农业合作社社员（入学程度可由实际情况而变更），三年毕业（倘能招收具有蚕桑经验之社员则两年毕业亦可）。其实习课程，至少占全部课程百分之二十。其班数，由需要多少而定。在农业学校，须加开蚕桑课程，定为一个学期（下学期），两时（包括见习），使学生获得蚕桑概念，回社后，得照顾到蚕桑副业。中等丝绸学校，专培养丝绸工厂之基层技术人员，招收初中毕业之青年工人，三年毕业。其实习课程，至少占全部课程百分之二十，其班数，亦由需要而定。
    蚕丝教学上，必须有相当之实习设备，在蚕桑教学上，应设蚕种场、桑场、桑苗圃、丝茧饲育室及蚕桑推广实验区，在丝绸教学上，应设制丝厂和织绸厂。如是，学生才能在实习中获得生产上之技术和管理的经验。但蚕丝专业教员，亦须尽量吸收生产经验，俾得运用这类生产设备，以指导学生。
    以上所陈，是否有当，请各位代表指正。
