Xinhua News Agency, February 25th, Paris Dispatch: U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy, appointed as the "mediator" in the French-Tunisian dispute, arrived in Paris from London on February 24th and held talks with French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard and Foreign Minister Pineau. Both Murphy and Pineau declined to issue statements after their talks on the 24th.

Reuters reported from Paris on the 24th that, since neither France nor Tunisia currently intends to make concessions to the other, the task of the U.S.-British "mediators" is expected to be "extremely difficult." The most thorny point is Tunisia's demand that the talks must include the Algerian issue and the withdrawal of French troops from the naval base in Tunisia, both of which have been flatly rejected by the French government.

Murphy flew from Paris to Tunis on the 25th.

    法突双方都不肯让步
    墨菲奔走巴黎和突尼斯
    据新华社25日讯　巴黎消息：受命担任法国和突尼斯纠纷的“斡旋人”的美国副国务卿帮办墨菲2月24日从伦敦到巴黎同法国总理盖伊阿和外交部长比诺举行了会谈。墨菲和比诺在24日的会谈以后都拒绝发表声明。
    路透社24日从巴黎发出的消息说，由于法国和突尼斯双方目前都不打算向对方让步，美英“斡旋者”的任务预计是“极为困难的”，最棘手的一点是突尼斯要求会谈必须包括阿尔及利亚问题和法国军队撤出在突尼斯的海军基地问题，而这两点都已经为法国政府所断然拒绝。
    墨菲已经在25日从巴黎乘飞机到达突尼斯。
