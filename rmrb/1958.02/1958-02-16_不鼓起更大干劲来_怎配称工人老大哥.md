Comrade Wang Guiying said: The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant is filled with an atmosphere of "everyone talking about the Great Leap Forward, everyone comparing indicators, the backward learning from the advanced, and the advanced becoming even more advanced." He also raised a noteworthy issue: a rationalization proposal made by a worker, if implemented, could increase the annual steel output of two workshops by 74%. However, some leading comrades in the factory were concerned that this would lead to a serious imbalance in raw materials and equipment, and held a skeptical and negative attitude towards such a significant rationalization proposal. Wang Guiying said that if this is done, the imbalance will inevitably occur. But this is not something to be feared, but something to be greatly welcomed. Either break the routine and use the advanced links that create new records to drive the backward links and achieve a common Great Leap Forward; or stick to the rules and let the backward links hold back the advanced links, resulting in no leap forward or only a small leap forward.
I fully agree with and support all the reports made at the congress, and I will resolutely implement them in my actual work.

　　Sixteen Days of Creating Seventeen New Records All the Moving Deeds in the Factory are Emerging One After Another
The great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer has given the workers and staff of our iron and steel enterprises tremendous encouragement and strength. The workers and staff of our Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant are fighting with boiling enthusiasm and full confidence to realize this great call. At the beginning of this year, the production situation in the entire factory was very different from previous years. Morale continued to rise, and good news was frequently reported. The forging workshop created seventeen new records in sixteen days. The highest new record for shift output exceeded the plan by 69%; the highest new record for daily output exceeded the plan by 49%. The workers and staff of the rolling workshop created twenty-three new records in less than a month. The workers and staff of the open-hearth steelmaking workshop overfulfilled the January production task by 13.9%, creating a new historical record for monthly output. The workers and staff of the ironmaking, electric furnace, and thin plate workshops also continuously created new records. Lian Zhi'en, a worker in the finishing section of the thin plate workshop, got blisters on his hands while cutting high-silicon steel plates, but he did not complain or slack off, and continued to work hard. The workers and staff of the open-hearth steelmaking workshop did not take a holiday on New Year's Day and repaired No. 3 furnace. Such moving deeds are emerging one after another throughout the factory and can be seen everywhere.

　　Plan Revision, Revision, and More Revision
　　Indicators Increased, Increased, and Increased Again
Why do the workers have such great enthusiasm? It is very clear that our entire workforce, after undergoing the tempering and education of the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the socialist righteousness has overwhelmed all evil and unhealthy tendencies. It is precisely because people's thinking, work style, and habits have undergone unprecedented great changes that, on the production front, as soon as they heard the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to catch up with Britain, it was like a large reservoir that had opened its floodgates, and a huge torrent burst out. Furthermore, the workers saw that the revolutionary enthusiasm of their farmer brothers was growing stronger and stronger, and they felt even more that if they did not muster greater enthusiasm, they would not be worthy of being called "worker elder brothers." Therefore, our factory is now filled with an atmosphere of: everyone talking about the Great Leap Forward, everyone comparing indicators, the backward learning from the advanced, and the advanced becoming even more advanced. It is in this atmosphere that the original annual plans all appear backward and conservative. The leading cadres of the thin plate workshop originally planned to increase production by 2,500 tons and save 420,000 yuan this year. As soon as this plan was revealed, it was fiercely criticized by the workers. After discussion by all the workers and staff, it was revised five times, and finally, the workers' representative congress decided to increase production by 5,500 tons, an increase of 120% compared with the original plan; the savings plan was revised to 650,000 yuan, an increase of 54.76% compared with the original plan, and the output of high-silicon steel was doubled compared with last year. Within a few days in mid-January, the workers and staff of the forging workshop increased the plan to save 600,000 yuan to 800,000 yuan, and then leaped to 1.35 million yuan, an increase of 125% compared with the original plan. The production plan of the rolling workshop was originally 231,830 tons, and then it was revised to 232,000 tons, but it was still completely rejected when submitted to the workers' representative congress for discussion. The congress decided that the annual output should reach 249,020 tons. The original production task proposed for small rolling was 110,000 tons, which was later changed to 120,048 tons, and then to 125,000 tons. Even after such repeated revisions, it was still not approved by the workers. After the workers' representative congress calculated and debated, it was finally determined that the annual output should be 130,000 tons. Some leading cadres in the workshop believed that this bold, advanced, and reliable plan could not be realized, so they coldly said to the workers, "Let's see the truth at the end of the month." However, in order to realize their plan, the workers carried out technical performances to break through technical norms on the second day. They produced 185 pieces for the first time, and the highest actual production was 190 pieces, breaking through the highest quota of 180 pieces, and all the quality was up to standard. In the face of this fact, the leading comrades in the workshop took the initiative to examine their conservative thinking. Here, I want to especially talk about the primary rolling workshop that is under construction in our factory. This workshop was originally planned to be put into production in the first quarter of 1959, but due to the strong will and heroic enthusiasm of the workers and staff, it will be put into production in October this year. Recently, after discussion by the workers' representative congress, it was moved forward by another month as a gift to National Day. The entire construction period was shortened to thirteen months, while the fastest construction speed of such a large-scale workshop in Britain and the United States would take sixteen to eighteen months. In this regard, we have not only caught up with Britain, but also surpassed the United States.

Within fifteen years, we must not only catch up with or exceed Britain in terms of output, but also catch up with and surpass it in terms of quality. In this regard, the workers and staff of the entire factory also showed amazing courage and revolutionary perseverance. The steelmaking workshop plans to produce 230,000 tons of good steel throughout the year, an increase of 24.8% compared with last year. At the same time, the output of high-quality steel must account for 30% of the total number of furnaces, doubling compared with last year. Judging from the production situation in early January, the qualified rate of steel quality has increased by 0.48% compared with the original plan, the average smelting time per furnace has been shortened by seven minutes, and the furnace bottom utilization coefficient has increased by an average of 0.622% compared with last year. The common oath of the workers and staff of the entire workshop is: to do everything possible to catch up with the advanced domestic level.

　　Finding Tricks, Tapping Potential, Burning Waste A Wave of Diligence and Frugality in Running Enterprises Sweeps the Entire Factory
The tide of finding tricks, tapping potential, providing rationalization proposals, burning waste, and running enterprises diligently and frugally has swept the entire factory. The workers and staff of the rolling workshop provided 33 rationalization proposals in the twenty days of January. The proposal made by Song Anshun to use scrap steel heads instead of pig iron retaining clips, after being adopted, increased the service life of the retaining clips by 6 to 30 times, saving 18,000 yuan in manufacturing costs per year. At the same time, it greatly saved time and increased productivity. For example, the counter-retaining plate used pig iron retaining clips in the past, and one shift used one set. With this kind of retaining clip, six shifts only used one set, which also saved five times the time of changing the retaining clips. In the past, the positive retaining plate used two sets per shift. With this kind of retaining clip, fifteen shifts only used one set. In addition, it also eliminated flat iron and improved quality. In terms of increasing output, the workers and staff of the open-hearth steelmaking workshop put forward a major rationalization proposal: take advantage of this year's major and medium repairs to renovate No. 1 and No. 2 open-hearth furnaces, increase the furnace type, and increase the capacity from the current 50 tons per furnace to 75 tons. After this improvement, 66,000 tons of steel will be produced more in one year. Wu Dianli, chairman of the trade union of the electric furnace steelmaking workshop (who was promoted from a steelmaking worker), put forward a major proposal for "three-link method" steelmaking and personally designed the sketch. This proposal is: install pig iron furnaces and converters near No. 3 and No. 4 electric furnaces, load pig iron into the pig iron furnace, melt it into molten iron, load it into the converter, and then load it into the electric furnace, so that various high-quality steels can be smelted at will. It has three major advantages: first, it can greatly shorten the smelting time and increase steel output. It now takes more than four hours to smelt a furnace of alloy steel or carbon steel. After changing to the "three-link method", it only takes more than two hours on average to smelt alloy steel and carbon steel. The smelting time is shortened by half compared with the current smelting time. Calculating the output per furnace at 11 tons, each furnace can produce 3,850 tons of steel per month, and 46,200 tons per year. After No. 3 and No. 4 furnaces are changed to the "double-link method", the two furnaces can produce 92,400 tons of steel per year. These two furnaces alone can increase production by 53,000 tons per year. We calculated the accounts: after doing this, 793,000 tons of steel can be increased in the next fifteen years. If one year of design and construction time is removed, calculated at fourteen years, it can still increase production by 740,000 tons. Second, it solves the difficulty of insufficient scrap steel sources (pig iron can be used). Third, it trains technical talents for the new workshop (preparing to build a "three-link method" steelmaking workshop in the future). The cost required to adopt these two major rationalization proposals and technological transformations is not much, and 4 million yuan is enough. Once put into production, the profit from the increased production in at most half a year can recover the entire investment; and the annual steel output of these two workshops can increase from 235,000 tons in 1957 to 410,000 tons, an increase of 74%. However, some leading comrades and engineering and technical personnel in our factory have different views on such major proposals put forward by the workers. They are concerned that this will lead to a serious imbalance in raw materials and equipment. Therefore, they hold a skeptical or even negative attitude. Of course, after doing this, the imbalance will inevitably occur. But this is not something to be feared, but something to be greatly welcomed. Either break the routine and use the advanced links that create new records to drive the backward links and achieve a common Great Leap Forward; or stick to the rules and let the advanced links adapt to the backward links, resulting in no leap forward or a small leap forward. This is the difference between the promoting faction and the conservative faction. Chairman Mao taught us that imbalance is absolute, balance is temporary, and the cycle from imbalance to balance and then from balance to imbalance is the law of development of all things. The production cause is certainly no exception. If you don't recognize this principle, you won't be a true revolutionary promoter. Now, our factory is launching a debate on the above-mentioned rationalization proposals. I hope that the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry will pay attention to and support it.

　　The Workers and Staff of the Entire Factory Carry Out a Heated Socialist Competition with Greater Determination and Enthusiasm
Fellow representatives, under the strong leadership of the Party, the surging tide of the entire workforce of our factory leaping forward and leaping forward again is changing the spiritual outlook and production outlook of the entire factory. Comparing indicators, learning from the advanced, and catching up with Britain has become the conscious action of every worker. Under this circumstance, the entire factory has formulated a plan for 1958: the total output value is 180,291,000 yuan, which is an increase of 20.49% compared with the national plan of 149,626,000 yuan; compared with the actual completed output value of 146,769,000 yuan in our factory in 1957, it will increase by 22.83%. Among them, the output of open-hearth steel will increase by 24.8% compared with last year, and the output of electric furnace steel will increase by 21.6% compared with last year. The output of pig iron will increase by 13.2% compared with last year. The cost will be reduced by 14.7% compared with 1957, and the increase in production and savings will be 45 million yuan. Now, this plan has been approved at the workers' representative congress held in the factory. All the workers and staff are carrying out a heated socialist competition movement with greater determination and enthusiasm in order to complete and overfulfill this plan.

It can be asserted that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, relying on the heroic socialist enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, we can catch up with Britain in less than fifteen years and throw this old-brand imperialism far behind us.

    不鼓起更大干劲来　怎配称工人老大哥
    王贵英代表说：太原钢铁厂充满着“人人谈跃进，个个比指标，落后学先进，先进更先进”的气氛。他并且提出一个值得注意的问题：一个工人提出的一项合理化建议，实行以后，两个车间的钢年产量可以提高74％。可是厂内有些领导同志却耽心这样做会出现原料和机器设备严重不平衡现象，对这样重大的合理化建议抱着怀疑和否定的态度。王贵英说，这样做了，不平衡现象必然要出现。但这不是什么可怕的事，而是极可喜的事。或者打破常规，用创造新纪录的先进环节来带动落后环节，共同大跃进；或者墨守成规，让落后环节扯住先进环节，而不跃进、或小跃进。
    我完全同意和拥护大会所作的各项报告，并且要在实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    十六天创十七次新纪录  全厂动人事迹层出不穷
    党中央和毛主席提出的在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其它主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的伟大号召，给我们钢铁企业的职工以巨大的鼓舞和力量。我们太原钢铁厂的职工，正以沸腾的热情，信心百倍地为实现这个伟大的号召而战斗着。今年一开头，全厂生产情况就和往年大不相同。士气不断高涨，捷报到处频传。锻钢车间在十六天内，连创十七次新纪录，最高的班产新纪录，超过计划的百分之六十九；最高的日产新纪录，超过计划的百分之四十九。轧钢车间的职工，在不到一个月的时间内，连创二十三次新纪录。平炉炼钢车间的职工，超额百分之十三点九完成了一月份的生产任务，创造了历史上的最高月产新纪录。炼铁、电炉、薄板等车间的职工，也都连创新纪录。薄板车间精整工段工人连志恩，在剪切高矽钢板时，把手烧起了泡，仍不叫苦和松气，一直干下去。平炉炼钢车间的职工，元旦不休假，检修了三号炉。这种动人的事迹，在全厂层出不穷，到处可见。
    计划修改、修改、再修改
    指标提高、提高、又提高
    为什么工人们有那样大的劲头呢？很清楚，我们全体职工群众由于经过了反右派斗争和整风运动的锻炼和教育，社会主义的正气，压倒了一切邪气和歪风。正是因为人们的思想、作风和习惯都发生了空前的大变化，所以在生产战线上一当听到党中央和毛主席提出的要赶上英国的号召之后，就像开了闸门的大水库一样，一股巨大的洪流排山倒海地奔放出来了。再加工人们又看到农民兄弟的革命干劲越来越大，就更加感到如果自己不鼓起更大的干劲，就不配称为“工人老大哥”。因此，现在我们厂里正充满着这样的气氛：人人谈跃进，个个比指标，落后学先进，先进更先进。正是在这种气氛中，原来确定的年度计划统统显得落后和保守了。薄板车间的领导干部原计划今年增产二千五百吨，节约四十二万元。这个计划一露头，就遭到工人的猛烈抨击。经过全体职工讨论，先后修改了五次，最后经职工代表大会决定，增产五千五百吨，比原计划提高百分之一百二十；节约计划修订为六十五万元，比原计划提高了百分之五十四点七六，并且把高矽钢的产量，比去年提高一倍。锻钢车间的职工们在一月中旬的几天内，将节约六十万元的计划，提高到八十万元，进而又跃进到一百三十五万元，比原计划提高了百分之一百二十五。轧钢车间的生产计划，原来是二十三万一千八百三十吨，以后又修改为二十三万二千吨，但提交职工代表大会讨论，还是全部被否定，大会决定年产要达到二十四万九千零二十吨。轧钢小型，原提出的生产任务是十一万吨，以后改为十二万零四十八吨，再改为十二万五千吨。就是这样三番五次的修改，还是没有被工人通过，经职工代表大会算账和辩论，最后确定为年产十三万吨。这个大胆、先进而又可靠的计划，车间的一些领导干部，认为不可能实现，所以他们冷冷地向工人们说“月底看虚实吧”。可是，工人们为了实现自己的计划，在第二天，就进行突破技术定额的技术表演，第一次生产了一百八十五根，最高实产一百九十根，突破了一百八十根的最高定额，质量全部合乎规格。在这个事实面前，车间的领导同志主动地检查了自己的保守思想。在这里，我要特别说一说我们厂正在施工的初轧车间。这个车间，原计划在一九五九年第一季度投入生产，但由于职工们的坚强毅力和英勇干劲，要提前到今年十月份投入生产。最近，经职工代表大会讨论，又提前了一个月，作为给国庆节的献礼。全部施工期限缩短为十三个月，而这样规模的车间，在英美最快的施工速度也要十六个到十八个月。在这一点上，我们不仅赶上了英国，也超过了美国。
    在十五年内，我们不仅要在产量方面赶上或超额英国，在质量上也要赶上和超过它。在这方面，全厂职工同样表现出惊人的气魄和革命的毅力。炼钢车间计划全年要生产良钢二十三万吨，比去年提高百分之二十四点八。同时，还要使优质钢的产量，占到总炉数的百分之三十，比去年提高一倍。从一月份上旬的生产情况看，钢的质量合格率，比原计划提高了百分之零点四八，每炉钢的冶炼时间平均缩短了七分钟，炉底利用系数平均比去年提高了百分之零点六二二。全车间职工的共同誓言是：要千方百计，赶上国内的先进水平。
    找窍门　挖潜力　火烧浪费  勤俭办企业浪潮席卷全厂
    找窍门、挖潜力、提供合理化建议、火烧浪费和勤俭办企业的浪潮，已经席卷全厂。轧钢车间的职工，在一月份的二十天内，就提供合理化建议三十三件。宋安顺提出的用废钢头代替生铁卡铁片一项，经采用之后，使卡铁片的寿命提高了六至三十倍，一年可节省造价费一万八千元。同时，还大大节省了时间，提高了生产率。如反围盘，过去用生铁卡铁片，一个班用一付，用这种卡铁片，六个班才用一付，还省了五次换卡铁片的时间。正围盘过去是一班用两付，用这种卡铁片，十五个班才用一付。此外，还消灭了扁铁，提高了质量。在提高产量方面，平炉炼钢车间的职工，提出了一项重大的合理化建议：利用今年大中修的机会，改建一、二号平炉，把炉型加大，由现在每炉容量五十吨提高到七十五吨。这样改进以后，一年就多产钢六万六千吨。电炉炼钢车间工会主席武殿利（是由炼钢工提拔的），提出了“三连法”炼钢的重大建议，并且亲自设计了草图。这个建议是：在三、四号电炉附近装设化铁炉和转炉，把生铁装入化铁炉，化成铁水装入转炉，然后再装入电炉，这样可随意炼各种优质钢。它有三大好处：第一，可以大大缩短冶炼时间提高钢产量。现在炼一炉合金钢或炭素钢，需用四个多小时，改为“三连法”以后，合金钢和炭素钢平均起来，只用两个多小时就能炼成。比现在的冶炼时间缩短一半。每炉产量按十一吨计算，每月每个炉子可产钢三千八百五十吨，一年可产四万六千二百吨。三、四号炉改为“双连法”以后，两个炉子一年可产钢九万二千四百吨，仅这两个炉子，一年就可增产五万三千吨。我们算了一下账：这样做后，在今后十五年内，就可以增产钢七十九万三千吨。如果除去一年设计施工时间，以十四年计，还能增产七十四万吨。第二，解决了废钢来源不足的困难（可用生铁）。第三，给新车间培养技术人材（将来准备修建“三连法”炼钢车间）。采用这两项重大的合理化建议和技术改造，所需用的费用并不多，有四百万元就足够了。一旦投入生产，顶多用半年增产获得的利润，就能把投资全部收回；而这两个车间钢的年产量，即可由一九五七年的二十三万五千吨，增长到四十一万吨，提高百分之七十四。可是，我们厂内有些领导同志和工程技术人员，对工人们提出的如此重大的建议，却有不同的看法。他们耽心这样做，会出现原料和机器设备严重的不平衡现象。因而他们抱着怀疑以至否定的态度。当然这样做了之后，不平衡现象必然要出现。但这不是什么可怕的事，而是极可喜的事。或者打破常规，用创造新纪录的先进环节来带动落后环节，共同大跃进；或者墨守成规，让先进环节适应落后环节，而不跃进、小跃进。这就是促进派和保守派之间的分歧所在。毛主席教导我们说，不平衡是绝对的，平衡是暂时的，由不平衡到平衡，再由平衡到不平衡，循环不已，这是一切事物发展的规律。生产事业当然不会例外。不承认这个道理，就不会是一个真正的革命促进派。现在我们厂里，正在就上述的合理化建议展开着辩论。希望冶金工业部予以重视和支持。
    全厂职工以更大的决心和干劲  开展热火朝天的社会主义竞赛
    各位代表，我们厂在党的坚强领导下，全体职工跃进再跃进的滚滚巨浪，正在改变着全厂的精神面貌和生产面貌。比指标、学先进、赶英国已经成为每个职工的自觉行动。在这种情况下，全厂订出了一九五八年的计划：总产值为一亿八千零二十九万一千元，与国家计划一亿四千九百六十二万六千元相比，将提高百分之二十点四九；与一九五七年我厂实际完成产值一万四千六百七十六万九千元相比，将提高百分之二十二点八三。其中，平炉钢产量将比去年增加百分之二十四点八，电炉钢将比去年增加百分之二十一点六。生铁产量将比去年增加百分之十三点二。成本比一九五七年降低百分之十四点七，增产节约四千五百万元。现在，这个计划已经在厂内召开的职工代表大会上通过。全体职工正以更大的决心和干劲，为完成和超额完成这个计划而展开着热火朝天的社会主义竞赛运动。
    可以断言，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，凭着全国人民英勇的社会主义干劲，不用十五年，就可以赶上英国，把这个老牌帝国主义远远地抛在我们的后面、再后面。
