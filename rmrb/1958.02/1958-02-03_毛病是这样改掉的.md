　　Bad Habits are Corrected This Way
　　Li Wenju, Shangnan County People's Committee, Shaanxi Province
    I don't know when I developed a bad habit: every meal I would scatter rice grains, pieces of cornbread, and vegetable scraps. When I was a child, my mother often scolded me for this: "When you eat, you have to have a chicken following you..." Later, after I started working, comrades also gave me their opinions more than once, and I also made several self-criticisms, but I didn't correct it. Only when I went to the countryside last year did an old farmer fundamentally cure me of it.
    This happened in October last year when I went to the Triangular Pond Township to participate in the water conservancy construction movement and stayed at a commune member's home, also eating meals there. The first day after finishing work, as soon as I stepped into the door, he greeted me with a smile and brought out lunch, saying to me: "Comrade, you've worked hard. It's just a simple meal, but eat your fill." Probably because I was very hungry, I picked up the fragrant corn porridge and the golden corn cornbread and began to eat greedily.
    After eating, just as I took out a cigarette and put it in my mouth, the old farmer came to clear the table. He first went to where I had been eating, bent down, picked up the pieces of cornbread I had dropped on the ground, blew on them, and ate them without saying a word.
    My face immediately flushed red, as if someone had given me a resounding slap. I felt that I was too far behind the working people. In the past, I shouted "Save, oppose waste!" all day long, but for me, it was just empty talk.
    To be honest, since that day, I have never dropped cornbread or scattered rice grains while eating.

　　毛病是这样改掉的
　　陕西省商南县人民委员会　李文举
    不知什么时候养成了个坏毛病：每一顿吃饭都要撒点饭屑、馍块和菜把之类。小时候为这事妈妈常责骂我：“你吃饭得抱个鸡在跟前……。”后来参加了工作，同志们也都不止一次地提过意见，我也做过多次检讨，但都没有改过来。只有去年下乡，一个老乡给我从根本上治疗了它。
    这是去年10月间的事，我去三角池乡参加兴修水利运动，住在一个社员家里，也在他家搭伙。头一天收工后，我刚跨进门，他笑吟吟地端出午饭来，对我说：“同志，辛苦了，家常便饭，好不好，吃饱。”大概也是饿很了的缘故，我端起香喷喷的玉米粥，拿起黄橙橙的玉米馍，就贪婪地吃起来。
    吃罢饭，我刚掏出根香烟含在嘴角里时，老乡来收拾饭具了。他先到我吃饭的地方，弯下腰去，把我掉在地上的馍块拾起来，吹了吹，放在嘴里吃了，没有说一句话。
    我的脸立刻热辣辣的红了，像被谁打了个响亮的耳光。我觉得自己和劳动人民比起来，真是差得太远了。过去整天喊“节约啊，反浪费啊！”然而在我说来只是吊在口头上的一句空话。
    说真的，从那天起我吃饭再也不掉馍块、不撒饭屑了。
