    Luxurious Family Dormitories
    Last year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions built four family dormitories in Sanlihe, outside Fuxingmen in Beijing, with a total area of 13,260 square meters. Under the pretext of building dormitories for leading cadres, they adopted the City Design Institute's 1956 Type II standardized design, with a budgeted cost of over 70 yuan per square meter, exceeding the national standard for ordinary housing in 1957 (55 to 61 yuan per square meter). More seriously, during the construction process, they also consulted with the construction unit and added many unnecessary decorations, raising the standard of the original design. For example, the original design for the interior was a cement floor, but it was later changed to a magnesite floor used in high-end buildings, increasing the unit price per square meter from 0.94 yuan to over 7 yuan. This item alone increased the cost by about 40,000 yuan. The cost increased step by step, and the waste became greater and greater.
    Because the dormitories are built so exquisitely, they will also increase the economic burden on the cadres.

    豪华的家属宿舍
    去年，中华全国总工会在北京复兴门外三里河盖了四幢家属宿舍，面积一共一万三千二百六十平方公尺。他们以建首长宿舍为理由，采用了市设计院1956年二型定型设计，预算造价每平方公尺高达七十多元，超过了1957年国家规定的普通住宅（每平方公尺五十五到六十一元）的造价指标。更严重的是：在施工过程中，他们又与施工单位洽商，增加了许多不必要的装饰，提高了原设计的标准。如这个工程原设计的室内是水泥地面，后来又改成高级建筑物所使用的菱苦土地面，每平方公尺地面单价由九角四分提高到七元多，仅仅这一项，就大约增加费用四万余元。造价一步步提高，浪费也愈来愈大。
    由于宿舍盖得很讲究，也将会加重干部的经济负担。
