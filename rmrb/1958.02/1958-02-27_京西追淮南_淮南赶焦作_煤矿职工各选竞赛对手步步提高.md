The entire staff of the Jingxi Mining Bureau has decided to make a great leap forward in labor productivity, striving to reach the national average level in all labor indicators in the first half of this year, catch up with the Huainan Mining Bureau in the second half, and then further catch up with the most advanced level in the country.

When formulating the 1958 plan, Jingxi mine workers were full of energy and increased this year's coal production plan by 51.52% compared to last year without increasing the number of people. Recently, they compared the production situation of fraternal coal mines across the country and found that their labor efficiency was very backward. Last year, all five labor efficiency indicators of the Jingxi Coal Mine were below the national average; the most advanced Jiaozuo Mining Bureau in the country produced an average of 1.7485 tons of coal per production worker per day, while Jingxi Mine only produced 0.8815 tons. The ratio of good to bad coal seams in Huainan Mine is very close to that of Jingxi Mine, and the geological conditions are similar, but the five efficiency indicators of Huainan Mine are much higher than those of Jingxi Mine.

The leading cadres of Jingxi Mine analyzed the reasons for the low labor efficiency. They believe that as long as measures are taken to solve these problems, efficiency will be greatly improved.

Now, Jingxi Mine has set specific goals and many guarantee measures. The broad masses of workers are working selflessly to catch up with Huainan Mine. In the mines under the Mining Bureau, a high tide has formed with comparisons between classes, groups, and mining areas.

This newspaper also reports: "Vigorously innovate technology, use a technological leap forward to promote a production leap forward! Rely on the collective to catch up with Jiaozuo, and work hard for five years to break through ten million (tons)!" This is the ambitious goal recently set by the engineering and technical personnel of the Huainan Mining Bureau at a technical meeting.

This meeting focused on two central topics: how to carry out technological innovation and how to catch up with the advanced Jiaozuo Coal Mine in the country. It also conducted serious criticism of the right-leaning conservative thinking and complacency of some engineering and technical personnel. The meeting pointed out: These erroneous thoughts and emotions have greatly lagged Huainan Mine behind. For example, the production conditions of Huainan Mine are much better than those of other coal mines in East China, but in 1957, several major technical and economic indicators ranked at the bottom of East China. Facing these facts, the representatives were determined to show the courage to "scrape the poison off the bones" to eradicate the two major scourges—right-leaning conservatism and complacency—and strive to catch up with the advanced.

During the meeting, news came that "Jingxi Mine is catching up with Huainan Mine." This was an encouragement and a spur to the representatives.

The mine directors, party committee secretaries, and trade union chairmen of each mine also attended the meeting. After repeated analysis and research, they identified the key technical problems and weak links, and prescribed specific technical and organizational measures to address the problems. All the representatives were enthusiastic and unanimously approved this year's goal: to produce 6.91 million tons of coal throughout the year, an increase of 53.3% over last year's state plan.

### 京西追淮南　淮南赶焦作  煤矿职工各选竞赛对手步步提高

    京西追淮南　淮南赶焦作
    煤矿职工各选竞赛对手步步提高
    本报讯　京西矿务局全体职工决定在劳动生产率方面来个大跃进，争取今年上半年使各项劳动指标达到全国平均水平，下半年赶上淮南矿务局，然后进一步赶上全国最先进的水平。
    在制订1958年计划的时候，京西矿职工就鼓起干劲，在不增加人的情况下，把今年产煤计划比去年提高51.52％。最近，他们比较了全国各兄弟煤矿的生产情况，发现自己的劳动效率十分落后。去年京西煤矿的五项劳动效率指标全部在全国平均水平线下面；全国最先进的焦作矿务局平均一个生产工人每天出煤一点七四八五吨，而京西矿只出零点八八一五吨。淮南矿和京西矿好、坏煤层比重很接近，地质条件差不多，而淮南矿的五项效率指标比京西矿都高得多。
    京西矿领导干部分析了劳动效率不高的原因。他们认为，只要采取措施解决这些问题，效率一定会大为提高。
    现在，京西矿已经定出了具体的奋斗目标和许多保证措施。广大职工正在为赶上淮南矿而进行着忘我的劳动。在矿务局所属各矿，班与班比、组与组比、采区与采区比，形成了高潮。
    本报讯　“大力革新技术，以技术大跃进来推动生产大跃进！群策群力赶上焦作，苦战五年突破千万（吨）！”这是淮南矿务局工程技术人员最近在技术会议上立下的宏愿。
    这次会议围绕着如何进行技术革新和怎样追赶全国先进的焦作煤矿两大中心议题进行了热烈的讨论，对部分工程技术人员的右倾保守思想和骄傲自满情绪进行了严肃的批判。会议指出：这些错误的思想情绪已经使淮南矿大大落后了。例如淮南矿矿井生产条件比华东各煤矿都好得多，而1957年有几项主要技术经济指标都名列华东末尾。代表们面对着这些事实，决心拿出“刮骨疗毒”的勇气来挖掉两大祸根——右倾保守和骄傲自满，力争赶上先进。
    会议期间，传来了“京西矿追淮南矿”的消息。这对代表们是一个鼓舞，也是一个鞭策。
    各矿矿长、党委书记、工会主席也参加了会议。经过反复分析研究，找出了技术上的关键问题和薄弱环节，并且对症下药地订出了具体的技术组织措施。全体代表热情沸腾，一致通过了今年的奋斗目标：全年产煤六百九十一万吨，比去年国家计划提高53.3％。
