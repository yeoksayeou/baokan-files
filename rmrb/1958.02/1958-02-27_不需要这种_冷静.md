    This Kind of "Calmness" Is Not Needed
    Lí Shùzhī
    Recently, all work is undergoing a great leap forward. People are inspired by the great combat goals, filled with enthusiasm, and doing their utmost to make their work more, faster, better, and more economical. But there are also some people who regard the great leap forward of others as "impulsive" and "boasting," and their own conservatism and backwardness as "calmness" and "seeking truth from facts." The implication is that they are stable and reliable, while others are emotional and not realistic enough.
    It seems that there are only a few people with this kind of thinking, but the harm of this kind of thinking is very great. First, it hinders people's great leap forward; second, it spreads a wrong concept to people: as if revolutionary ambition and the spirit of revolutionary heroism are all "impulsive" and "boasting," while the attitude of being content with the status quo and lacking revolutionary courage is some kind of "calmness" or "seeking truth from facts." This is really turning right and wrong upside down.
    Is the Great Leap Forward "impulsive," "uncalm," or "boasting"? It can also be said to be impulsive. But this is the impulse of strong revolutionary enthusiasm, the impulse of revolutionary spirit aroused by mature historical conditions, or, as Lenin said, the historical pioneering spirit of the masses, the impulse of determined "heaven-storming attempts." Having this kind of impulse is a manifestation of having revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary will, and having a feeling of breathing together and having the same pulse with the great era and the great socialist cause. On the contrary, "Let the wind and waves rise, I sit steadily in the fishing boat," being "calm" and completely detached from the great storm of mass construction, and having no response to the great era and the great mass movement, then what kind of stuff is this "calmness"?
    However, our kind of revolutionary enthusiasm is completely different from the temporary emotional impulse of being hot-headed and not calmly analyzing the objective situation. The current Great Leap Forward is a new situation: the subjective and objective conditions are fully available, and a leap forward has become inevitable. With the Chinese Communist Party as such a strong Marxist party as the leader, and with such a powerful liberated productive force of 600 million people as the foundation; with the promotion of such a broad people's ideological emancipation, and with such reliable measures as comprehensive planning and everything through experimentation as a guarantee, isn't this a great time to let go and strive for the upper reaches? Therefore, it is not only not "uncalm," but very calm, very meticulous; it is the result of a calm, meticulous, profound, and practical analysis of the objective situation, it is a real seeking truth from facts, and there is no intention of speaking empty words.
    Is conservatism and backwardness really "calm" and "seeking truth from facts"? They are indeed both "cold" and "calm." Their revolutionary will has declined, and they have even lost their revolutionary enthusiasm, to the point of being indifferent in the face of such a great era. They are so cold that their limbs are cold, and so quiet that they have become a stagnant pool, and they are about to grow moldy and smelly. This is a "cold" and "quiet" disease that is close to death, and there is no way to talk about "seeking truth from facts." "Seeking truth from facts" has always been another name for "revolutionary spirit," and it has nothing to do with twilight conservatism. Using "seeking truth from facts" as a shield to maintain conservatism and backwardness is really a distortion of "seeking truth from facts."
    Lenin said: "Anyone who distorts the theory of calmly explaining the objective situation into a defense of the existing order...discarding 'revolutionary illusions' as quickly as possible and turning to 'realistic' patching work, is not a Marxist." (Lenin: "Marx's Letters to Kugelmann" Russian translation preface People's Publishing House pamphlet, page 7) This is indeed like a targeted acupuncture for patients with this "cold" and "quiet" disease, which they need to chew on and reminisce about.

    不需要这种“冷静”
    黎庶之
    最近以来，什么工作都在大跃进，人们为伟大的战斗目标所鼓舞，热情洋溢，一个劲地要把工作做得更多更快更好更省。但是也有这么一种人，他们把别人的大跃进视为“冲动”、“说大话”，把自己的保守落后视为“冷静”、“实事求是”。言下之意是他们稳妥可靠，别人是感情用事、不够切实。
    看来，有这种思想的人只是少数，但是这种思想的危害却是很大的。一则，它障碍着人们的大跃进；二则，它把一种错误的观念传布给人：仿佛革命的志气、革命英雄主义的气概都是“冲动”，都是“说大话”，而安于现状、缺乏革命胆略的态度反而是什么“冷静”，是什么“实事求是”。这实在是颠倒是非的说法。
    大跃进是不是“冲动”、“不冷静”、“说大话”呢？也可以说是冲动。但这是强烈的革命热情的冲动，是成熟了的历史条件唤起的革命精神的冲动，或者像列宁所说的那样，是群众的历史首创精神、决意实行“冲天尝试”的那么一种冲动。具有这种冲动，才是具有革命热情和革命意志的表现，是对于伟大的时代和伟大的社会主义事业，有呼吸相关、脉搏相通的感情。反之，“任凭风浪起，稳坐钓鱼船”，“冷静”得与群众建设的大风暴完全脱节，对伟大的时代和伟大的群众运动毫无反响，那么，这种“冷静”算个什么货色呢？
    然而，我们这种革命热情的奋发，又截然不同于那种头脑发热，不冷静分析客观情况的一时感情冲动。当前的大跃进，是这样一种新形势：主客观条件已经充分具备，飞跃前进已成必然。有中国共产党这样坚强的马克思主义政党作领导，有六亿人这样强大的解放了的生产力作基础；有这样广大的人们的思想上的解放的推动，又有全面规划一切通过试验这样可靠的措施作保证，这难道还不是放手大干力争上游的大好时机。所以，它不但不是“不冷静”，而是冷静得很，周密得很；是冷静、周密、深刻、切实地分析了客观情势的结果，是真正的实事求是，而毫无说空头大话之意。
    保守落后，果真是“冷静”，是“实事求是”吗？他们的确是既“冷”又“静”，他们的革命意志衰退，甚至失去了革命热情，以至面对如此伟大的时代而无动于衷。他们冷到了四肢发凉，静到了变成一洼死水，眼看就要生霉发臭了。这是一种近乎死亡的“冷”病和“静”病，那里还能谈得上“实事求是”。“实事求是”从来都是“革命精神”的别称，同暮气保守是毫不相干的。把“实事求是”当作维护保守落后的盾牌，这实在是对于“实事求是”的曲解。
    列宁说过：“谁要是把冷静地说明客观情况的理论曲解为对于现存秩序的辩护，……尽可能迅速地丢弃‘革命的幻想’而转向于‘现实主义的’修补工作，那他就不是马克思主义者。”（列宁：“马克思致库格曼书信集”俄译本序言人民出版社单行本第七页）这倒满像是给这种“冷”、“静”病患者对症的针砭，是需要他们好好咀嚼和回味的。
