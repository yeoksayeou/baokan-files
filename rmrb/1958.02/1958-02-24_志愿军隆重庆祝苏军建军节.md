Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd - The headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) held a grand meeting this afternoon to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army. More than 800 officers and soldiers from the CPV headquarters attended the meeting.

    Ding Laifu, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the CPV, made a report at the meeting. He said that all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, like the Soviet soldiers, directly bear the important responsibility of stopping aggression and defending peace. As our troops are about to completely withdraw from Korea, we must guard against arrogance and complacency, strictly adhere to our posts, and complete our work tasks even more excellently. We must take the Soviet army as an example and make new contributions to the cause of defending world peace and supporting the socialist construction of the motherland and Korea.
