Farming and Studying Simultaneously, Both Red and Expert
Huazhong Agricultural College Pays Attention to the Close Integration of Education and Production
    (Our newspaper's reporter Gu Weijin reports) After the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the socialist consciousness of teachers and students at Huazhong Agricultural College has been raised to an unprecedented level. They have put forward the bold slogan of "holding a hoe in one hand and a book in the other, farming and studying simultaneously, being both Red and expert, and achieving self-sufficiency in production through three years of hard work." Inspired by this slogan, all teachers and students are planting experimental fields (the ones planted by students are called practice fields) and practicing work-study programs to integrate education and production.
    In the past, when teachers and students at Huazhong Agricultural College were asked to participate in labor, they had a misconception, saying:
  "This is a way to train labor models, not scientists. Only by experimenting in advanced laboratories can scientists be trained." Therefore, many people were unwilling to participate in labor. Even when students went to farms and agricultural cooperatives for internships, they were out of touch with reality, and what they learned could not solve practical problems. Last year, some students were sent to farms for teaching internships, but the comrades on the farms did not welcome them, saying, "The value created by a student's labor in a day is not even worth the two steamed buns they are given each day." After graduation, students were reluctant to go to the countryside and preferred to stay in the city.
    After the rectification in November last year, the socialist consciousness of teachers and students was further raised. They enthusiastically responded to the call of the college's Party committee to "integrate education and production," learning from rural cadres to plant experimental fields, while also engaging in land reclamation, vegetable planting, pig raising, rabbit raising, and so on. Currently, the experimental fields planted by faculty and staff cover more than 130 mu, averaging more than three fen per person; the practice fields planted by students cover more than 600 mu, averaging two to three fen per person (with some having eight fen). To prepare for spring plowing, teachers and students are accumulating fertilizer, repairing canals, and preparing the fields. In addition, some students have gone deep into the countryside to investigate and summarize production experiences.
    At the same time, teachers and students at the college are participating in various service-oriented labor activities through work-study programs: 1. Voluntary labor: each person spends half a day (i.e., Sundays) each month helping the school with greening, etc.; 2. Semi-voluntary labor: each person spends one day each month participating in farm production, with wages halved. In the past two months, there have been 2,829 workdays, earning more than 1,000 yuan; 3. Full-paid labor: Under the principle of not affecting studies, students use Sundays to participate in the school's basic construction projects or farm production. Since November of last year, they have earned more than 2,800 yuan; 4. Sideline labor: Students have generally organized haircutting groups, shoe repair groups, photo developing groups, etc., which start operating every day after class at cheap prices (such as haircuts for eight fen per person), which are very popular among students.
    The facts of the past two months (from November of last year to the present) have proven that the integration of education and production has many benefits. First, it has cultivated the fine character of teachers and students. In the past, teachers and students had three fears about labor: fear of getting dirty, covering their noses when they saw manure; fear of leeches, with some people wearing leather shoes to go to the fields; and fear of getting tired. Now this phenomenon is gone. In the fertilizer accumulation movement, students in each class built toilets, dug manure cellars, and cleaned classrooms and toilets (which were originally done by workers), treating manure and garbage as treasures. Many agronomists who never easily went to the fields now often carry manure baskets everywhere to find fertilizer sources. In temperatures below zero degrees Celsius, students still accumulate fertilizer in ponds barefoot. Second, it has improved the quality of teaching and learning. Last year, teaching staff conducted more than 100 research and experimental projects, but few were successful. Now, after personally cultivating experimental fields, they can use their professional knowledge more skillfully. In the past, fourth-year students in the Agricultural Management Department needed the help of technicians to formulate production plans and financial plans during their internships, otherwise they could not proceed. Now, having learned about the entire production process through labor, the problem of formulating plans has been solved. They proposed that they should make up for what they had not learned in the past three years within this year; their graduation theses are also more profound. In the past, third-year students in the Fertilizer and Soil Department did not even know how to start simple composting or dig manure cellars. Now, many people can make standard compost and are praised by farm workers. Students have deeply realized in participating in agricultural production: Participating in production is the general examination of learning. Third, it has exercised the body and improved health. Fourth, it has solved student expenses and saved state expenditures. Since November of last year, students have earned 2,110 yuan in remuneration for participating in various service-oriented labor activities, and 128 people have voluntarily requested to reduce their stipends, saving the state 390.4 yuan per month.
    Recently, the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League was conveyed and discussed at the college. The enthusiasm of all members of the Communist Youth League and students in the college is even greater. They proposed an initiative: The school has abundant means of production, including farms, pastures, dairy cows, pigs, fruit trees, lakes, tractors, etc., as well as more than 2,600 faculty, staff, and student laborers. These human and material resources must be fully utilized to earn tuition and living expenses, striving to be partially self-sufficient within one year, half self-sufficient within two years, and fully self-sufficient within three years. The students also demanded that in the future, they should achieve "three comparisons" (compare learning, compare labor, compare ambition), "five competencies" (be able to plow and till the land, be able to accumulate and apply fertilizer, be able to eliminate pests, diseases, waterlogging, and drought, be able to select and sow seeds, and be able to manage fields), and "two guarantees" (enthusiasm and dedication), and turn Lion Mountain (the school's address) into a "bountiful large garden" within one year.

    边耕边读　又红又专
    华中农学院注意教育和生产紧密结合
    本报讯　记者古维进报道：经过整风运动和反右派斗争，华中农学院师生的社会主义觉悟空前提高，提出了“一手拿锄头，一手拿书本，边耕边读，又红又专，苦战三年，生产自给”的豪迈的口号。在这一口号的鼓舞下，全体师生种植试验田（学生种的叫实习田），实行勤工俭学，使教育和生产结合起来。
    过去，华中农学院师生提起参加劳动，有一种错误的认识，说：
  “这是培养劳动模范的办法，不是培养科学家的办法，只有在高级试验室里试验，才能培养出科学家。”因此，许多人不愿意参加劳动，学生们即使到农场和农业社实习，由于脱离实际，学习的东西不能解决实际问题。去年有些学生派到农场作教学实习，农场的同志不欢迎，说：“学生劳动一天创造的价值，抵不上每天发给他们的两个馒头。”学生毕业以后留恋城市，不愿下乡。
    去年11月整改以后，师生的社会主义觉悟提高一步，热烈响应院党委“教育和生产结合”的号召，学习农村干部种植试验田，同时进行开荒、种菜、喂猪、养兔等。现在，教职员种植的试验田有一百三十多亩，平均每人三分多田；学生种植的实习田六百多亩，平均每人二三分田（多的八分田）。为了准备春耕，师生正在积肥、修渠、整田。另外，有些学生深入农村调查总结生产经验。
    与此同时，该院师生勤工俭学，开始参加了各种服务性劳动：一、义务劳动——每人每月以半天（即星期天）时间帮助学校进行绿化等；二、半义务劳动。每人每月以一天的时间参加农场生产，工价折半，两月来出工二千八百二十九人次，得工资千余元；三、全报酬劳动，在不影响学习的原则下，学生们利用星期天参加学校的基本建设工程，或在农场生产。去年11月至今得工资二千八百多元；四、副业劳动，同学们普遍组织了理发小组、补鞋小组、洗像小组等，每天课余开始营业，价钱便宜（如理发，每人八分），同学们非常欢迎。
    两月来（从去年11月至今）的事实证明，教育和生产结合有很多好处。首先是培养了师生的优良品德。过去师生对于劳动有三怕：怕脏，见了大粪掩鼻而过；怕蚂蟥虫，有的人穿着皮鞋下田；怕累。现在这种现象没有了。在积肥运动中，各班同学都盖厕所，挖粪窖，打扫教室和厕所（原来是工友干的），看见粪便和垃圾视若宝贝。有许多农学家从来不轻易下田的，现在都经常背着粪筐到处找寻肥源，在零下二度的天气里，学生们仍然赤着脚在塘中积肥。其次，提高了教学和学习的质量。去年，教学人员进行了一百多个研究试验项目，但成功的很少，现在亲自培育试验田后，可以比较熟练的使用自己的专业知识，农业经营管理系四年级学生过去实习时制订生产规划和财务规划等，需要技术员帮助，否则就无法进行。现在从劳动中了解到整个生产过程，制订规划的问题解决了。他们提出，过去三年来没有学到的东西，要在今年内把它补起来；他们作的毕业论文，也比较深刻了。肥料土壤系三年级学生，过去连简单的堆肥都不知如何动手，也不会挖粪窖，现在很多人可以作出合乎规格的堆肥，得到农场工友赞许。学生们在参加农业生产中深刻体会到：参加生产是学习的总考试。第三，锻炼了身体，增进了健康。第四，解决学生费用，节省国家开支，从去年11月至今，学生们参加各种服务性劳动获得报酬二千一百一十元，有一百二十八人自动要求降低助学金，每月为国家节约三百九十点四元。
    最近，该院传达和讨论了共青团三届二中全会的精神，全院共青团员和学生们的干劲更大，他们提出倡议：学校的生产资料很丰富，有农场、牧场、奶牛、猪、果木、湖沼、拖拉机等，还有二千六百多个教职员工和学生的劳动力，必须使这些人力、物力发挥充分作用，争取学习费和生活费，在一年内部分自给，二年内半自给，三年内全部自给。学生们还要求今后做到“三比”（比学习、比劳动、比志气）、五会（会犁田整地、会积肥施肥、会除病、虫、水、旱四害、会选种播种、会田间管理）、两保证（干劲、钻劲），在一年内把狮子山（学校住址）变成“丰产的大花园”。
