Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th: The Shanghai Turbine Factory has broken away from the complex and time-consuming ordering conventions, reducing the original eight or nine steps for ordering procedures to just one. After this reform, the factory's ability to undertake processing orders has greatly changed. In just over a month this year, it has already signed 108 collaborative processing contracts.

In the past, a collaborative processing or ordering business at the Shanghai Turbine Factory had to go through eight or nine steps, taking one or two months to sign a contract. In the past, situations often arose where workshops didn't have enough work, but orders from outside couldn't be accepted.

As the rectification campaign entered the stage of systematic rectification, the factory greatly simplified its structure and procedures, cut down on a number of departments, and unified the business of accepting orders under the Production Planning Section, which manages the overall production situation of the factory.

    上海汽轮机厂打破订货常规
    八道手续只剩一道
    据新华社上海11日电　上海汽轮机厂打破层次繁多，周转费时的订货常规，把原来经过八、九道关的订货手续，简化到只剩一道。经过这样改革后，这个厂承接加工订货的情况有了很大的转变。今年一个多月内，已签订了一百零八项协作加工合同。
    过去上海汽轮机厂通常一件协作加工或订货业务，要过八、九道关，花一两个月时间才能签订合同。过去常发生这样情况：车间吃不饱，外面订货却接不进来。
    整风进入系统整改阶段，这个厂大大简化了机构和手续，裁并了一批科室，并且把承接订货的业务由掌握全厂生产情况的生产计划科统一经办。
