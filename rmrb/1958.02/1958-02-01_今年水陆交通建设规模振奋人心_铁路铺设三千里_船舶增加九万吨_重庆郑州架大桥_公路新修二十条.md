Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: The railway construction undertaking in our country will further develop in the first year of entering the Second Five-Year Plan. This year, the state's investment in railway construction is initially determined to be 1.52 billion yuan, an increase of 19.4% over last year.

This year, the total length of new and double-track railways planned to be laid is about 1,500 kilometers, including more than 1,200 kilometers of new railways. The focus of railway construction is in the Northwest and Southwest regions.

In the Northwest region, the railway from Baotou to Lanzhou will be completed before the end of this year. This important transportation line connecting the new industrial bases in the Northwest and North China is 1,000 kilometers long. By the end of last year, 454 kilometers had been laid. In order to cooperate with the construction of the Karamay Oilfield in Xinjiang, efforts will be made to extend the railway there by 1960. This year, the Lanxin Railway will continue to extend westward, with a planned track laying of 313 kilometers, reaching Hami in Xinjiang.

In the Southwest region, the construction speed of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway and the Guiyang-Duyun section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway will be accelerated this year. In order to lay the foundation for the construction of a railway network in the Southwest region of our country during the Second Five-Year Plan period, so that the Southwest region can communicate with the whole country from the north, east and south directions, the state also requires the railway department to vigorously prepare for the construction of the Hunan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Yunnan Railways this year.

The railway from Nanping on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway to Guantou, another national defense outpost on the southeast coast of our country, will be laid to Fuzhou this year.

The railways to be built this year also include: the railway from Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Henan to Jincheng in Shanxi, the unfinished railway from Yingshouyingzi to Huairou on the Beijing-Chengde Railway, the railway from Zhangping to Longyan on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, the railway from Lianjiang to Maoming on the Lizhan Railway, and forest railways leading to the Greater Khingan Mountains and Changbai Mountains forest areas.

The important railway projects to be built this year also include: the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge and the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge. The Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge will connect the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway.

The electrification project of the Baoji-Fengxian section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, my country's first electrified railway, will also start this year.

Under the condition that the state's financial and material resources are possible, the investment in railway construction this year may also be appropriately increased.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: This year, my country will add 381 new ships with a total deadweight of more than 96,000 tons on the sea and inland rivers. These ships include those belonging to the central and local governments. Among them, 90 ships belong to the Ministry of Communications, with a total deadweight of more than 79,000 tons. Among these ships, there are also two ocean-going freighters with a deadweight of 10,000 tons.

This year, the national shipping construction investment has increased compared with last year. The investment in shipping construction by the Ministry of Communications increased by 4.6% compared with last year. About half of these investments are used for shipbuilding, and the rest are mainly used for port construction and shipyard construction.

In terms of ports directly under the Ministry of Communications, the main ones for new construction and expansion of wharfs include Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing. In Shanghai Port, preparations will begin this year to build a large-scale land-water combined transportation terminal at Zhanghuabin, Wusongkou.

The main projects of a river port built on the north bank of the Yangtze River, the terminal station of the Huainan Railway - Yuxikou, and a seaport built in Basuo on the west coast of Hainan Island, will be completed this year.

A shipyard newly built in Guangzhou during the First Five-Year Plan will be basically completed this year. The two shipyards with larger new construction and expansion projects this year are Wuhan and Shanghai.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: This year, my country will carry out 20 highway projects above the limited amount, with a total length of more than 6,000 kilometers; among them, 11 will be completed this year, with a total length of nearly 2,500 kilometers.

Of these 20 highway projects, 12 are constructed by the central government and 8 are constructed by the local governments.

The highways constructed by the central government include the reconstruction project of the highway from Dunhuang, Gansu to Mangnai, the oil exploration base in the Qaidam Basin (completed this year), the newly built highway from Changmaidi on the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway to Huize, the Greater Khingan Mountains forest highway from Mianduhe to Xiaoergou, and the highways distributed in the minority areas of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu and other provinces.

The eight highways constructed by local governments this year mainly include the highway from Shiping, Yunnan to Yangwu, the highway from Lanzhou, Gansu to Langmu Temple, and the highway from Urumqi to Korla. In order to support agricultural production and develop the mountainous economy, local governments will also build many simple roads and wide lanes this year.
