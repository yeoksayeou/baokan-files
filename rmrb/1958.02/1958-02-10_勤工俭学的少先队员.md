Diligent and Thrifty Young Pioneer

　　Jin Zengfan is a student in the sixth grade of the Primary School attached to the Chuxian Normal School in Anhui Province. His family consists of four people: his father, mother, and younger sister. The family relies entirely on his father's work for a living, and their financial situation is relatively tight. Both he and his sister are in school, and their tuition and textbook fees amount to about ten yuan per semester. Although the school waives a portion of their tuition, paying the remaining amount is still difficult. Jin Zengfan uses his vacations and holidays to participate in physical labor, both studying and working, using the income from his labor to cover his tuition fees.

　　Last summer vacation, Jin Zengfan worked as a laborer for twenty-five days with construction workers, earning twenty-two yuan and fifty cents. Later, he went up the mountain and cut more than seven hundred catties of grass, selling it for eight yuan and forty cents. In one summer vacation, his labor income totaled thirty yuan and nine cents, which not only covered the tuition fees for both siblings for one semester but also subsidized the family. Therefore, Jin Zengfan proposed this semester that he no longer needed the school's tuition waiver. After the start of the school year, he also used Sundays to work as a laborer with older workers. By the end of last year, he had already paid for his textbooks for the next semester.

　　Now, the winter vacation has arrived. Jin Zengfan has already made plans to do any work that is available, and if there is no work, he will go up the mountain to cut grass, continuing to use the income from his labor to cover his tuition fees. Li Ronghui

　　勤工俭学的少先队员
    金增璠是安徽省滁县初师附小六年级的学生，家中有爸爸、妈妈、妹妹四口人，全靠他爸爸做工过活，家庭经济生活比较紧。他和妹妹又上学，每学期两个人的学杂费书本费就要缴十元左右。虽然学校免了他们一部分学费，但是其余部分缴起来也感到有困难。金增璠便利用假期和假日参加体力劳动，一面读书，一面劳动，用自己劳动的收入来解决学杂费用。
    去年暑假里，金增璠跟建筑工人做了二十五天小工，收入二十二元五角。后来，他又上山砍了七百多斤草，卖了八元四角。一个暑假，劳动收入就有三十元零九角，不但解决了兄妹两人一学期的学习费用，还补助了家庭。因此，金增璠本学期提出不再要学校免费。开学以后，他又利用星期日跟老工人做小工，去年年底，他就已经把下学期的书费缴齐了。
    现在，寒假已经到了。金增璠已经订出了计划，有工就去做，没有工就上山砍草，用自己的劳动所得来的报酬继续解决学杂费用。　李荣辉
