Having heard the five solemn guarantees made to the congress by the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles represented by representatives Wang Guangying, Zhu Jisheng, and Zhou Shutao, we feel extremely excited and greatly encouraged. We thank them for their spurring us on, and we must learn from them.

We believe that to become self-reliant laborers, we should: 1. Politically, meet the six criteria instructed by Chairman Mao and firmly stand on the working class's position; 2. In work, achieve matching responsibilities and conscientiously fulfill our duties through labor practice; 3. In life, be diligent and thrifty, meeting the standard of "to each according to his work."

We, representing the Shanghai industrialists and businessmen, guarantee to transform ourselves into self-reliant laborers who meet the above three conditions within five years. "Look at three years in five years, and at the first year in three years." "Fight hard for three years and change our outlook." We strive to have the majority of us become self-reliant laborers within three years. In this year, we must first achieve: 1. All 50,000 capitalist industrialists and businessmen must participate in the comprehensive rectification movement, including the anti-Rightist struggle. Through self-examination and mutual assistance, establish individual rectification plans. All 130,000 small business owners must engage in a great debate on the two roads by breaking with the capitalist standpoint and establishing a socialist standpoint through socialist education and establish rectification covenants by industry or group; 2. Through quarterly inspections and annual evaluations, require more than 80 percent of capitalist industrialists, businessmen, and small business owners to implement rectification plans and covenants; 3. All private sector staff, except for those who are old, infirm, or genuinely have difficulties, must be required to spend a certain amount of time going down to workshops and grassroots units to participate in production labor or other physical labor; 4. All private sector staff and small business owners must each propose at least one practical and feasible rationalization proposal for improving production technology and business management.

Our Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce must strengthen policy education and theoretical study for members through grassroots organizations, conduct criticism and self-criticism, regularly inspect the implementation of rectification plans and covenants, and urge revisions according to the development of the situation to ensure the concrete realization of the above indicators.

We believe that under the leadership of the Party, under the supervision of the working class, and driven and encouraged by the great leap forward in socialist construction, our industrialists and businessmen, through the rectification movement and on the basis of improving ideological understanding, have the determination and ambition to accelerate their transformation through continuous efforts and to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers ahead of time. We, the Shanghai industrialists and businessmen, are willing to encourage each other and advance together with industrialists and businessmen nationwide!

    争取三年内成为自食其力的劳动者
    上海工商业者愿与全国同业互相勉励共同前进

    我们听到了王光英、朱继圣、周叔弢三位代表代表天津工商界向大会提出的五项庄严保证，我们感到万分的兴奋和莫大的鼓舞，我们感谢他们对我们的鞭策，我们一定要向他们学习。
    我们认为要做到成为自食其力的劳动者，应该：1．在政治上做到符合毛主席所指示的六项标准，站稳工人阶级立场；2．在工作上通过劳动实践做到职责相称，守职尽责；3．在生活上勤俭持家，做到符合“按劳取酬”的标准。
    我们代表上海工商业者保证在五年内改造成为符合上述三个条件的自食其力的劳动者。“五年看三年，三年看头年。”“苦战三年，改变面貌。”我们争取三年内多数人就能做到成为自食其力的劳动者。在本年内，首先要做到：1．全体五万资本主义工商业者都参加包括反右派斗争在内的全面整风运动，通过自我检查，相互帮助，订立个人整改规划；全体十三万户小业主通过破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场的社会主义教育，展开两条道路的大辩论，订立按行业或小组的整改公约；2．通过季度检查、年度评比，要求百分之八十以上的资本主义工商业者和小业主贯彻执行整改规划和公约；3．所有私方实职人员除了年老体弱确有困难之外，都要规定一定时间，下车间、基层参加生产劳动或其他体力劳动；4．所有私方实职人员和小业主每人至少提出一条对改进生产技术、经营管理方面切实可行的合理化建议。
    我们民建上海市委会、市工商联一定要通过基层组织，对成员加强政策教育、理论学习，展开批评与自我批评，定期检查整改规划和公约的执行情况，并按照形势的发展督促修订，以保证上项指标的具体实现。
    我们相信，在党的领导下，在工人阶级的监督下，在社会主义建设大跃进的推动和鼓舞下，我们工商业者通过了整风运动，在提高思想认识的基础上，有决心、有志气经过不断努力，一定能够加速改造，提前把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者。我们上海工商业者愿意和全国工商业者互相勉励、共同前进！
