　　New Measures to Support the Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production
    Changsha City Factories and Agricultural Cooperatives Link Up
    (Our newspaper's Changsha dispatch, February 2nd, reporter Gao Changren) “One factory linked to one agricultural cooperative” is a new measure recently adopted by Changsha City, Hunan Province, to support the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. This means that each factory signs a contract with a nearby agricultural cooperative, maintaining regular contact, with the factory guaranteeing to use its resources to help the agricultural cooperative increase production. The Changsha Machine Tool Plant has already signed a contract with the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative, guaranteeing to provide the Hongguang Cooperative with 400 free labor days this spring. In addition, it will accumulate 10,000 dan of fertilizer for the Hongguang Cooperative. When the Hongguang Cooperative needs technical assistance, the factory will provide unconditional support. Because the Machine Tool Plant and the Hongguang Cooperative are closely linked, the contract also stipulates that the factory is responsible for educating workers to comply with the agricultural cooperative's rules and regulations, and the agricultural cooperative also educates its members not to violate the factory's rules; both parties are responsible for improving environmental sanitation and public security.
    When these factories "link up" with agricultural cooperatives, they generally combine this with their own business. The Hunan Bacterial Fertilizer Factory plans to help a nearby agricultural cooperative make full use of the bacterial fertilizer produced by the factory, and the factory is responsible for providing technical guidance on its use. The Jianxiang Cigarette Factory plans to vigorously help the agricultural cooperative it is linked to massively trial-plant flue-cured tobacco. Such assistance can not only promote the development of agricultural cooperatives but also greatly benefit factories in assessing whether their products are suitable for needs and increasing raw materials. In addition, workers at the Changsha Water Pump Factory are also preparing to use waste materials and perform voluntary labor in the first half of this year to manufacture ten water pumps to send to agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs. On February 1st, the factory had already manufactured two water pumps using waste materials.
    When workers in Changsha City factories discussed how to specifically help the agricultural cooperatives linked to their factories, they identified many potential resources that had been neglected by the factories in the past but could be of great help to the agricultural cooperatives. More than ten rice mills in the city discard more than three million catties of rice bran ash every year. Now, in conjunction with the patriotic health campaign, collecting the rice bran ash will provide excellent farmland fertilizer. The Changsha Meat Joint Processing Factory recently prepared to supply a large amount of pig manure and sewage in a planned way to the agricultural cooperatives in a nearby township, which will enable the township to achieve its thousand-catty yield plan this year. The Huaxin Flour Mill plans to properly store the residue from flour production and transport it out, which can help the agricultural cooperative raise 2,000 pigs each year.
    Currently, factories in Changsha City and agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs are successively signing contracts and strengthening ties. According to the factories' plans, during the busy farming season this year, factories throughout the city will provide 40,000 free labor days to nearby agricultural cooperatives. The Changsha Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a call to the technical personnel of all factories: "Every technical person should do a good thing for the countryside." At present, the technical personnel of all factories are using their brains to help the agricultural cooperatives technically.

### 支援农业生产大跃进的新措施  长沙市工厂和农业社挂钩

　　支援农业生产大跃进的新措施
    长沙市工厂和农业社挂钩
    本报长沙2日电　记者高长任报道：“一个工厂和一个农业社挂钩”，这是湖南省长沙市最近在支援农业生产大跃进上采取的一个新措施。这就是每个工厂都和附近一个农业社签订合同，经常联系，工厂保证利用自己的力量帮助农业社增产。长沙机床厂已和红光农业社签订了合同，机床厂保证在今年春季支援红光社四百个义务劳动日；另外，还要为红光社积肥一万担，在红光社需要技术力量帮助时，工厂就无条件支援。由于机床厂和红光社紧密相连，合同还规定：工厂负责教育工人遵守农业社规章，农业社也教育社员不违犯工厂厂规；双方负责搞好环境卫生和治安工作。
    这些工厂在与农业社“挂钩”时，一般都结合自己的业务。湖南细菌肥料厂计划帮助附近一个农业社充分使用这个厂出产的细菌肥料，工厂负责在使用技术上尽力指导。建湘烟厂计划大力帮助自己所联系的农业社大量试种烤烟。这样的帮助，不仅能促进农业社的发展，对工厂鉴定自己的产品是否适合需要及增加原料也有很大好处。另外，长沙水泵厂工人还准备在今年上半年利用废料和实行义务劳动，制造十台水泵，送给郊区农业社。2月1日，这个厂已利用废料制成了两台水泵。
    长沙市各工厂工人在讨论如何具体帮助本厂联系的农业社时，找出了许多过去为工厂忽视，但对农业社却有很大帮助的潜在力量。全市十多个米厂，每年都有三百多万斤糠灰抛弃了，现在结合爱国卫生运动，把糠灰收集起来，就是很好的农田肥料。长沙肉类联合加工厂最近准备把大量的猪粪、污水，有计划地供给附近一个乡的各农业社，这样就可使这个乡今年能实现千斤丰产计划。华新粉厂准备把做粉用的渣子保管好，运出去，每年就可帮助农业社喂猪两千头。
    现在，长沙市各工厂和郊区农业社正陆续签订合同，加强联系。根据各厂计划，在今年农忙季节，全市工厂将为附近农业社做四万个义务劳动日。中共长沙市委最近向各厂技术人员提出了“每一个技术人员要为农村做一件好事情”的号召，目前，各厂技术人员正在开动脑筋，要在技术上帮助农业社。
