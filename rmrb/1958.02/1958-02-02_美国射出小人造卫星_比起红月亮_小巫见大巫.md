Xinhua News Agency, 1st: Washington Dispatch: After numerous failures, American scientists used a Jupiter-C rocket at 3:48 AM International Standard Time on February 1st to launch a small artificial satellite into orbit. This satellite weighs less than one-sixth of the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite or equivalent to one thirty-eighth of the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite. After the satellite launch, American news agencies gave it a great deal of publicity, and the American president also issued a statement on the matter.

This satellite, named "Explorer," which was launched approximately four months later than the Soviet Union's first satellite, was also launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, where "Vanguard" rocket satellite launches had repeatedly failed. The satellite, plus the empty shell of the last stage rocket, weighs 29.7 pounds (13.4 kilograms). The satellite is cylindrical, with a diameter of 6 inches (15 centimeters) and a length of 80 inches (203 centimeters). Due to its small size, it is difficult to see with the naked eye. The satellite is equipped with two radio transmitters, which transmit radio signals at two different frequencies. One signal is 108 megahertz, and the other is 108.3 megahertz.

The American satellite travels at a speed of 8 kilometers per second, orbiting the Earth every 113 minutes, and its orbit is also elliptical. The angle between the satellite's orbital plane and the Earth's equatorial plane is 35 degrees. This means that the area it reaches is very limited, reaching only as far south as near Montevideo, Uruguay, and only as far north as near Zhengzhou in China. It cannot even reach Washington or New York in the United States itself. (See attached chart)

		Comparison of Soviet and American Artificial Satellites

		Note 1: The rocket thrust required for 35 degrees is less than that for 65 degrees. In other words, the required rocket technology level is lower.
		Note 2: That is to say, all continents except the central Antarctic region can see the Soviet satellite, while the American satellite can only reach near Zhengzhou in China to the north, and near Montevideo, Uruguay to the south. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 美国射出小人造卫星  比起红月亮　小巫见大巫

　　美国射出小人造卫星
    比起红月亮　小巫见大巫
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：经过多次失败以后，美国科学家在2月1日国际标准时间三点四十八分用丘辟特C式火箭把一个重量不到苏联第一个人造卫星六分之一或者相当于苏联第二个人造卫星三十八分之一的小人造卫星发射上了轨道。卫星发射后，美国通讯社大事宣传，美国总统还就此发表了声明。
    这个比苏联第一个卫星约迟四个月发出的卫星被定名为“探险者”，它也是在“先锋号”火箭发射卫星多次失败的佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角发射的。卫星加上最后一级火箭空壳的重量是二十九点七磅（十三点四公斤）。卫星呈圆柱形，直径是六吋（十五公分），长八十吋（二百零三公分）。由于体积太小，很难用肉眼看到。卫星内装有两台无线电发射机，分别用两种频率发射无线电讯号。一种讯号是一○八兆周，一种是一○八点三兆周。
    美国卫星以每秒八公里的速度运转，每一一三分钟绕地球一周，轨道也呈椭圆形。卫星轨道平面与地球赤道平面的交角为三十五度。就是说，它所到达的地区很有限，最南只能到达乌拉圭的蒙得维的亚附近，最北只能到我国郑州附近，连美国本国的华盛顿、纽约也到不了。（附图表）
　　苏联人造卫星和美国人造卫星的比较
　　注一：35度所需的火箭推力比65度要小。也就是说，所需的火箭技术水平要低一些。
　　注二：也就是说，苏联卫星除南极中心地区外，所有各洲都可以看到，而美国卫星最北只能到达我国的郑州附近，最南只能到达乌拉圭的蒙得维的亚附近。　（新华社）
