Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture victoriously completed the democratic reform with the abolition of slavery, the liberation of slaves, and the distribution of land as its main contents by the end of last year. Immediately following this, a comprehensive socialist education movement was launched. Before the democratic reform, the Liangshan Yi area was essentially a slave society. Two years of experience have proven that on such a backward foundation, not only can we leap forward to socialism through democratic reform, but we can also achieve a great leap forward.

Speech by Representative Wang Haimin

I fully agree with the various reports made at the conference and guarantee to resolutely implement them in practical work. Now, I will give a brief report to the conference on the situation of the great leap forward towards socialism in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province.

The great victories our country achieved on the political and ideological fronts in 1957, and the great leap forward on the industrial and agricultural production fronts that emerged across the country last winter and this spring, have greatly boosted the revolutionary zeal of the Yi people and promoted the development and progress of the Yi areas. Under the leadership of the Party, our prefecture, following the policy of peaceful reform, victoriously completed the democratic reform with the abolition of slavery, the liberation of slaves, and the distribution of land as its main contents by the end of last year, and immediately launched a comprehensive socialist education movement. The socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the Yi people have been unprecedentedly raised, laying a good foundation for the great leap forward towards socialism in our prefecture. Currently, a large-scale agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production movement are being carried out throughout the prefecture, presenting a new atmosphere of a great leap forward towards socialism.

The Sound of Leaping to Socialism Shakes Liangshan

Basic Realization of Agricultural Cooperativization Within Two or Three Years

Before the democratic reform, the Liangshan Yi area was essentially a slave society. On such a backward foundation, is it possible to leap forward to socialism after the democratic reform? Two years of experience have fully proven that: not only can we leap forward, but we can also achieve a great leap forward.

In the spring of 1956, in the first group of areas that completed the democratic reform, we began to focus on piloting agricultural production cooperatives. After a year of effort, the first upsurge of cooperativization was launched in the winter of 1956. By the spring of 1957, 1,397 cooperatives had been established throughout the prefecture (including 810 advanced cooperatives), with 52,422 peasant households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 26.8 percent of the total number of peasant households in the prefecture. Some townships basically realized cooperativization. The situation of this group of cooperatives is good. Although there were serious natural disasters last year, these cooperatives still increased production, and the members increased their income. For example, the Tuojia Primary Agricultural Cooperative in Zhaojue County increased agricultural production by 28.43 percent last year compared with 1956. With the addition of sideline production, the increase was 92.5 percent. The average income per member was 173 yuan, an increase of 90 percent compared with 1956, of which the average grain distributed per person was 717 jin, an increase of 28 percent compared with 1956. Another example is the Advanced Senior Agricultural Cooperative in Ebian County, which increased agricultural production by 61.2 percent last year. The average grain distributed per member was 722 jin, an increase of 68.2 percent compared with 1956, exceeding the average grain income of individual farmers in the local area by 43.7 percent, greatly demonstrating the superiority of the cooperatives. These vivid facts have encouraged the broad masses of Yi laborers and pointed out the direction for their progress. Especially after the comprehensive socialist education movement was launched last winter, the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of people has been further enhanced. The sound of "a great leap forward to socialism" has shaken Liangshan, forming a powerful revolutionary torrent. We have full confidence that, according to the original plan, we will develop the cooperatives to account for 45 percent of the total number of peasant households this spring, and basically realize the socialist agricultural cooperativization of the entire prefecture in the next two to three years. According to the recent situation, this plan is likely to be realized ahead of schedule. Such a speed of development is still backward compared with advanced ethnic groups, but in such a short period of time, the Yi area has leaped from a backward slave society, across several historical stages, to socialism. This cannot but be said to be a great historical leap forward.

It is not difficult to understand why our Yi people can leap from backwardness to advancement so quickly. Because: 1. The masses of slaves who have just been liberated have very strong demands for developing production and improving their lives, and many of their difficulties in production and life cannot be overcome when they work individually. Therefore, they urgently demand to be organized, take the road of cooperativization, rely on collective strength to develop production and improve their lives. 2. The socialist consciousness of the Yi people, especially the masses of slaves, has been rapidly improved. They deeply realize the truth that "only the road of socialism is the road to prosperity and strength for our nation." Therefore, they are actively striving forward towards socialism; this is the basic condition for the great leap forward of socialism. 3. In recent years, the Party's organizations have been universally developed in rural areas, and a large number of communist Yi cadres have been trained. This is the basic force for uniting and leading the Yi people to leap towards socialism. 4. All ethnic groups learn from each other, support each other, and encourage each other on the common basis of socialism, especially the great help of the Han people and Han cadres. This is an important condition for our Yi people to move forward. 5. The leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao is the fundamental guarantee for our victory.

Overcome All Difficulties, Break Through All Obstacles

Strive for a Great Leap Forward in Production, Catch Up with the Han Elder Brother

Before liberation, due to the national oppression policy of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the shackles of the slave system on the productive forces, our Yi area was very backward and poor. At that time, the level of agricultural production was very low, with an average yield of only 70 to 80 jin per mu, and most of the grain was exploited by the slave owners, so that the broad masses of slaves worked all year round and could not get enough to eat, relying on wild grass and vegetables to satisfy their hunger. After liberation, under the leadership and strong support of the Party and the government, production has developed to some extent, but because the slave system that restricts the development of productive forces has not been fundamentally changed, production still cannot be greatly developed; only after the democratic reform is realized can agricultural production achieve great development. By 1957, the average yield per mu in the prefecture had reached more than 130 jin, an increase of more than 40 percent compared with before liberation. With the development of forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production, the total value of production has increased more than twofold compared with before liberation, and the people's lives have been significantly improved. However, because most areas of our prefecture are high mountain and barren areas, and the democratic reform has just been completed, many areas have not yet realized cooperativization, and production technology has not been able to be greatly improved in time, so the production level is still very low for the time being. Our preliminary plan is: on the basis of 1957, this year's agricultural production will increase by 20 percent. By 1967, the average yield per mu will reach 400 to 600 jin, an increase of two to three times compared with 1957. During this period, the cultivated area will be expanded by 30 percent, and the average grain income per person will reach about 2,000 to 3,000 jin, basically catching up with the agricultural production level of the Han mountain areas. This plan is entirely achievable. Although the current production level in our prefecture is very low, the potential for increasing production is very large; as long as we have a "four major leaps forward" in fertilizer, water conservancy, land processing, and production technology, agricultural production can be greatly increased. Last year, only with a "small leap forward," there were high-yield records of 800 jin of corn per mu, 1,000 jin of rice, 500 jin of buckwheat, 400 jin of wheat, and 300 jin of rapeseed, which greatly increased the masses' confidence in increasing production. Due to the realization of democratic reform and the great development of agricultural cooperativization, the masses' enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high. "Strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production, catch up with the Han elder brother" has become the action slogan of the Yi people. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is the basic guarantee for the realization of the agricultural development plan.

Our Liangshan Yi area is still backward in all aspects, but we have full confidence that we will definitely be able to catch up with the advanced. This does not mean that we have no difficulties and obstacles on the road to progress, but under the leadership of the Party, we can overcome all difficulties, break through all obstacles, and forge ahead bravely. It was unimaginable in the past that our Yi people could leap to socialism in a short period of time and catch up with the Han people, but today, under the leadership of the Party, in the socialist family of nations of the motherland, and in the great Mao Zedong era, it can be completely realized. It is completely understandable why our Yi people so sincerely support the Party, love the motherland, and love our great leader Chairman Mao.

### 从奴隶社会直接过渡到社会主义

    从奴隶社会直接过渡到社会主义
    凉山彝族自治州在去年年底以前，全部胜利完成了以废除奴隶制度、解放奴隶和分配土地为主要内容的民主改革，并紧接着全面开展了社会主义教育运动。在民主改革以前，凉山彝族地区基本上还是奴隶制度社会。两年来的经验证明，在这样一个落后的基础上，经过民主改革不只能够向社会主义跃进，而且能够大跃进。
    王海民代表的发言
    我完全同意大会所作的各项报告，并保证在实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。现在我就四川省凉山彝族自治州向社会主义大跃进的情况，向大会作简要的汇报。
    一九五七年我们国家在政治战线上和思想战线上所取得的伟大胜利，去冬今春在全国范围内出现的工农业生产战线上的大跃进，大大鼓起了彝族人民的革命干劲，推进了彝族地区的发展与进步。我州在党的领导下，遵照和平改革的方针，在去年年底前，全部胜利完成了以废除奴隶制度、解放奴隶和分配土地为主要内容的民主改革，并紧接着全面开展了社会主义教育运动。彝族人民的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性已空前提高，为我州向社会主义大跃进奠定了良好的基础。目前，在全州范围内，开展了声势浩大的农业合作化运动和农业生产运动，出现了向社会主义大跃进的崭新气象。
    向社会主义跃进的声浪震动凉山
    两三年内要基本实现农业合作化
    在民主改革前，凉山彝族地区基本上还奴隶制度社会。在这样一个落后的基础上，是是不是经过民主改革就能够向社会主义跃进呢？两年来的经验充分证明：不只能够跃进，而且能够大跃进。
    一九五六年春，在第一批完成民主改革的地区，我们开始重点试办农业生产合作社。经过一年的努力，一九五六年冬掀起了第一个合作化高潮，到一九五七年春，全州建立起一千三百九十七个社（其中有八百一十个高级社），入社农户达五万二千四百二十二户，占全州总农户的百分之二十六点八，有的乡基本实现了合作化。这一批社的情况是良好的。去年虽有严重的自然灾害，这些社仍然增加了生产，社员增加了收入。如昭觉县托呷初级农业社，去年比一九五六年农业增产百分之二十八点四三，加上副业生产则增产百分之九十二点五，社员每人平均收入一百七十三元，比一九五六年增加了百分之九十，其中每人平均分得粮食七百一十七斤，比一九五六年增加了百分之二十八。又如峨边县先进高级农业社，去年农业增产百分之六十一点二，社员每人平均分得粮食七百二十二斤，比一九五六年增加了百分之六十八点二，超过当地单干农户平均粮食收入的百分之四十三点七，大大显示了合作社的优越性。这些活生生的事实，鼓舞了广大彝族劳动人民，向他们指明了前进的方向，特别是去冬全面开展社会主义教育运动后，广大群众的社会主义积极性更进一步高涨起来，“向社会主义大跃进”的声浪已震动凉山，形成了强大的革命巨流。我们有充分信心，按照原定规划，在今春将合作社发展到占总农户的百分之四十五，而在今后两三年内基本实现全州社会主义农业合作化。根据最近的情况看，这个规划很可能提前实现。这样的发展速度，同先进民族相比还是落后的，但在这样短短的几年内，彝族地区就从落后的奴隶制度社会，跨越几个历史阶段，过渡到社会主义，这不能不说是一个伟大的历史大跃进。
    我们彝族能够这样迅速地从落后跃向先进，是不难理解的。因为：一、刚获得解放的奴隶群众，对发展生产和改善生活有着十分强烈的要求，而他们在生产生活上的很多困难又是在单干时所不能克服的，因而他们迫切要求组织起来，走合作化道路，依靠集体力量发展生产，改善生活。二、彝族人民，特别是奴隶群众的社会主义觉悟迅速提高，他们深刻认识到“只有社会主义的道路，才是本民族繁荣富强的道路”的真理，因而积极向着社会主义奋勇前进；这是社会主义大跃进的基本条件。三、近年来，在农村普遍发展了党的组织，培养了大批共产主义的彝族干部，这是团结和带领彝族人民跃向社会主义的基本力量。四、各族人民在社会主义的共同基础上，互相学习，互相支援，互相鼓励，特别是汉族人民、汉族干部的大力帮助，这是我们彝族能够前进的重要条件。五、伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导，这是我们胜利的根本保证。
    克服一切困难　冲破一切障碍
    争取生产大跃进　赶上汉族老大哥
    解放前，由于国民党反动派的民族压迫政策，由于奴隶制度对生产力的束缚，我们彝族地区是非常落后与贫困的。当时，农业生产水平很低，平均亩产粮食只有七、八十斤，而大部分粮食又被奴隶主剥削去了，以致广大奴隶群众终年劳动，不得一饱，靠野草野菜充饥。解放后，在党和政府的领导与大力扶持下，生产有所发展，但由于没有从根本上改变束缚生产力发展的奴隶制度，生产仍不可能得到较大发展；只是在民主改革实现以后，农业生产才获得了大发展。到一九五七年，全州平均亩产已达到一百三十余斤，比解放前提高了百分之四十以上。加上林业、畜牧业和副业生产的发展，生产总值比解放前增长了一倍以上，人民生活有了显著的改善。但是由于我州多数地区是高山贫瘠地区，而又刚完成民主改革，不少地区还未实现合作化，生产技术未能来得及获得较大改进，因而生产水平暂时还是很低的。我们初步规划：在一九五七年的基础上，今年农业增产百分之二十。到一九六七年，平均亩产达四百斤到六百斤，比一九五七年提高两倍到三倍以上。在此期间，并扩大耕地面积百分之三十，每口人平均粮食收入达到二千斤到三千斤左右，基本上赶上汉族山区的农业生产水平。这个规划是完全能够实现的。我州目前生产水平虽然很低，但是增产潜力很大；只要我们在肥料、水利、土地加工和生产技术四方面来个“四大跃进”，农业就能大增产。去年只有“小进”，就出现了亩产玉米八百斤，水稻一千斤，荞子五百斤，小麦四百斤，油菜子三百斤的高产纪录，大大提高了群众的增产信心。由于民主改革的实现和农业合作化的大发展，群众的生产积极性空前高涨，“争取农业生产大跃进，赶上汉族老大哥”成了彝族人民的行动口号，群众的这股革命劲头，是实现农业发展规划的基本保证。
    我们凉山彝族地区目前在各方面都还是落后的，但是我们有充分的信心，一定能够赶上先进。这并不是说，我们在前进的道路上就没有困难和阻力，但是我们在党的领导下，能够克服一切困难，冲破一切阻碍，奋勇前进。我们彝族能够在不长的时间内跃进到社会主义，并且赶上汉族，这在过去来说是梦想不到的事情，而今天在党的领导下，在祖国社会主义的民族大家庭内，在伟大的毛泽东时代里，却完全可以成为现实。我们彝族人民所以那样衷心拥护党，热爱祖国，热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席，这是完全可以理解的。
