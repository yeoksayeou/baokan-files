Building Guangzhou into a Socialist Industrial City
Speech by Delegate Zhu Guang

Great Achievements in the Economic, Political, and Ideological Fronts in 1957

I fully agree with all the work reports made at the conference and suggest that the conference adopt them. Now, allow me to make a brief speech about the work in Guangzhou.

In the past year, Guangzhou, like all other parts of the country, has victoriously carried out the All-People Rectification Movement and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists. This is a great victory achieved on the political and ideological fronts following the decisive victory on the economic front in 1956 in the socialist revolution. Guangzhou's First Five-Year Plan has also been overfulfilled. In 1957, the city's total industrial output value reached 1.29 billion yuan (calculated at constant prices of 1952, same below), an increase of 11 percent over 1956. Among them, local industry (including handicrafts) reached 990 million yuan, an increase of 12 percent over 1956; the total output value of suburban agricultural and sideline production reached 32 million yuan, an increase of 8 percent over 1956; the total investment in capital construction in the entire region reached 130 million yuan, of which 50 million yuan was under the city's jurisdiction, an increase of 118 percent over 1956; the total retail sales of commodities in the whole society reached 710 million yuan, an increase of 15 percent over 1956; transportation, urban construction, culture, education, health and other undertakings have also developed greatly, and people's lives have also improved significantly.

However, there were also many shortcomings in our work last year. The most important one was the existence of right-leaning conservative thinking. Before the anti-rightist struggle, the understanding of the boundary between internal contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy was vague, so we once relaxed the struggle against bourgeois ideology and capitalist tendencies, relaxed the transformation of bourgeois elements, underestimated the enthusiasm of the masses in building socialism and the favorable conditions for accelerating construction, and overestimated the difficulties, and the targets were set conservatively. In addition, in handling the relationship between developing production and improving life, some places one-sidedly emphasized taking care of the lives of the masses, neglecting the education of the masses in arduous struggle, which affected people's tendency to only look at immediate interests and lack lofty ideals, and failed to arouse the enthusiasm of the masses. In addition, we also did not deeply understand and thoroughly implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results, and the spirit of starting from scratch has not been established. If we did not have these right-leaning conservative thoughts and the enthusiasm of the masses had been fully brought into play, then the achievements last year would have been even greater.

We strive to have the product quality of various major light industries, textile industries, and electromechanical industries catch up with the advanced national level within five years.

At present, the overall situation is very favorable for us to accelerate socialist construction. The rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle have greatly raised the socialist consciousness of the broad masses, and the enthusiasm for production has also generally increased. A new upsurge in production and construction is gradually forming throughout the city. Therefore, we have the confidence and determination to accelerate the construction of Guangzhou into a socialist industrial production city during the Second Five-Year Plan period. According to the central government’s proposed policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture based on the priority development of heavy industry, as well as the general requirement and task of catching up with or surpassing the United Kingdom in terms of the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer, we plan to double Guangzhou's total industrial output value in the next five years, that is, to reach 2.5 billion yuan in 1962, and to newly build or expand 22 industrial construction projects above the limit and conduct systematic and comprehensive technical transformation of existing industries. Now, the steel plant with an annual output of 340,000 tons of pig iron, the nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 210,000 tons of ammonium sulfate, the electrolytic chemical plant with an annual output of 15,000 tons of caustic soda, and the internal combustion engine plant with an annual output of 50,000 horsepower engines have already begun construction. We also plan to carry out the construction of factories for papermaking, rayon, ramie weaving, silk spinning, and plastics within five years. After the completion of these construction projects and the technical transformation of existing industries, Guangzhou's industrial production level and technical level will leap a big step forward, which can provide chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, pesticides, and various power machinery and agricultural implements for agricultural, fishery, and water conservancy construction in the province, provide sufficient industrial raw materials such as steel, acid, and alkali, and mechanical equipment for industrial production, and provide a large number of daily-use industrial and food industrial products for improving the lives of the broad masses and export trade. We must also actively improve industrial production technology and strive to have the product quality of various major light industries, textile industries, and electromechanical industries catch up with the level of advanced regions in the country within five years, and strive to have the quality of products such as batteries, rickshaw tires, lithopone, and sewing machines catch up with or surpass the level of the United Kingdom. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, in accordance with the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), suburban agriculture in Guangzhou will continue to implement the policy of serving the city and developing diversified operations, and strive to completely eliminate drought and universal flooding within two years, increase rice production to 1,000 catties per mu within three years, and further increase it to 1,200 catties within five years, and reach an average of 10 pigs per household by 1962. The production and income of all agricultural cooperatives should exceed the level of upper-middle peasants, so that the suburbs of Guangzhou will become a hometown of vegetables, a hometown of fruits, a hometown of dairy and meat, and a hometown of flowers and trees, and become an important base for supplying non-staple food and industrial raw materials to the city.

With the development of production and construction undertakings, people's lives will be further improved. We plan to solve the employment problem in Guangzhou within two years, eliminate illiteracy and universalize primary school education within five years, eliminate the "Four Pests" within three years, and realize comprehensive greening and the rectification of the city's sewers within two years. Baiyun Mountain in the suburbs will build water conservancy projects, plant economic forests everywhere, and become a Mountain of Flowers and Fruits. In addition, we are also preparing to carry out the construction of the second bridge connecting the two sides of the Pearl River—the Southwest Great Iron Bridge—within five years. In this way, Guangzhou, located at the southern gate of the motherland, will become a socialist industrial production city with developed industrial production, prosperous economy and culture, and clean and beautiful city appearance. Realizing this plan is not only the long-term wish of the people of Guangzhou, but also a arduous and glorious task for the people of Guangzhou.

1958 is the first year of my country’s Second Five-Year Plan. Based on the experience of my country’s successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan, the key to completing the Five-Year Plan lies in the first three years, and the most important of these three years is the first year. Therefore, Guangzhou must further implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results in 1958, overcome right-leaning thoughts, boost revolutionary enthusiasm, thoroughly eliminate bureaucratic airs, and set off an upsurge in production and construction to create a good start for the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan.

In terms of industrial production, this year we must do our best to actively tap the potential of industrial production and fundamentally change the current situation of low quality and high cost of Guangzhou's industrial products. This is a direction for our efforts this year. The total industrial and handicraft output value of the city is expected to increase by 15 percent over last year, and we strive to reach more than 20 percent. In the quality and variety of major products, such as transformers, storage batteries, amplifiers, enamel products, flashlights, batteries, gasoline lamps, rubber shoes, calcium carbonate, glucose, and health underwear, we must learn from Shanghai and keep up with them; individual varieties such as sugar-making machines must catch up with the international level; and we will try to produce and imitate various new products requiring more than 1,000 kinds (such as bacterial fertilizers, sugarcane earthing machines, water turbines, rubber accelerators, synthetic resins, air batteries, micro-hollow rubber, cotton and linen cloth, etc.). We are determined to do everything possible to improve enterprise management and increase labor productivity. It is expected that costs will be reduced by 5 to 7 percent compared to last year, and we strive to reduce them by 10 percent. The production potential of Guangzhou's local industry is very large. According to a recent survey of 15 factories in six industries including electromechanical, light industry, food, and chemical industry, it is preliminarily estimated that as long as an investment of 5.36 million yuan is made to add some factory buildings or add some equipment, the output value of production can be increased by 39 million yuan, an increase of 65.3 percent over the original, and 2,197 workers can be added, and the annual profit can reach 8.21 million yuan, which means that the entire investment can be recovered within eight months. Therefore, it is completely necessary to carry out technical transformation of existing enterprises in accordance with the principle of small investment and large returns. It is planned that 23 enterprises will be renovated and expanded this year with an investment of more than 50,000 yuan and less than 200,000 yuan, which will play a great role in expanding product output and improving quality.

In terms of capital construction: the total investment this year will increase by 25 percent compared to 1957. A total of 28 projects will continue to be constructed or started, including nine above the limit. Among them, large-scale and modern factories such as the nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 210,000 tons of fertilizer (ammonium sulfate), the steel plant with an annual output of 340,000 tons of pig iron, and the ramie textile factory with 20,000 spindles have all started construction, and the Overseas Chinese Sugar Factory with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 2,000 tons and the cannery with an annual output of 20,000 tons of canned food will be put into production this year. The completion of these factories will change the original backward economic situation in Guangzhou and will have a very significant impact on supporting the great development of agricultural production and expanding the export of industrial products.

The yield of rice per mu in the suburbs is 800 catties, and the yield of sugarcane per mu is 12,000 catties.

In terms of suburban agricultural production, the direction of effort this year is still to vigorously develop grain production in order to quickly reach the production level of advanced regions. It is estimated that the yield per mu of rice will reach 800 catties, the yield per mu of sugarcane will reach 12,000 catties, and the yield per unit area of other cash crops will be higher than last year. It is estimated that the total output value of suburban agricultural and sideline production will increase by more than 11 percent compared to last year, and we strive to enable the income of each agricultural cooperative member to reach the level of upper-middle peasants within two years. To this end, the suburbs plan to build 2,505 large and small water conservancy projects this year, striving to eliminate ordinary droughts this year, launch a campaign to accumulate 10,000 catties of fertilizer per mu, and before the spring rainy season, organize agency cadres, young students, and citizens to participate in labor, develop Baiyun Mountain, which occupies half of Guangzhou's urban area in the suburbs, build 24 large and small reservoirs, eradicate mountain torrents, prevent soil erosion, and irrigate more than 6,000 mu of farmland. These measures are of great significance for developing suburban agricultural and sideline production and various cash crop production.

In line with the requirements of the above-mentioned great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the total retail sales of commodities in the whole society are expected to increase by 4.34 percent this year, and the volume of transportation is expected to increase by 9.33 percent.

Eliminate illiteracy within five years and eliminate the four pests within three years.

In terms of culture and education: It is planned that middle school enrollment will increase by 9,000 people compared to last year. In addition to continuing to implement the two-part system, increasing classes, and encouraging the masses to run schools, we will also promote the method of combining work and study and part-work and part-study. Continue to carry out the literacy campaign. This year, the number of illiterate and semi-illiterate people enrolled in the city will increase by 46.8 percent compared to last year, striving to eliminate illiteracy within five years. At the same time, continue to carry out mass cultural and artistic and sports activities.

In terms of health: Vigorously carry out the patriotic health movement of the masses. In addition to striving to eliminate the four pests within three years, we strive to achieve "six nos" (no dust, no sewage, no garbage, no feces, no sputum, no dirt); advocate family planning and control the increase in the urban population.

Turn streets into gardens and turn barren mountains into woodland

In terms of urban construction: the main focus is on thoroughly transforming the water system (including Xiguan Yong, Xihao Yong, etc.), striving to solve the problem of ditch odor and tide inundation within two years. It is planned to fully carry out the city's greening work this year, gradually turning streets into gardens, turning dry roads in near suburbs and suburbs into forest belts, and turning all kinds of barren mountains and wastelands into woodland and orchards.

Compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and welcome the great leap forward in production in 1958.

In order to boost revolutionary enthusiasm, accelerate Guangzhou's socialist construction, in accordance with the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results, set off a mass production and construction upsurge, and ensure the victorious completion of the 1958 plan targets and work tasks, we must take the All-People Rectification Movement as the driving force to promote all work, as "the key to lifting up all work," and make the rectification and socialist education movement deep, thorough, and good, striving to achieve complete victory in the All-People Rectification Movement on all fronts in the first half of this year. In order to further stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses for production and realize a great leap forward in socialist construction, our party and government leading cadres must first resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative thoughts and eliminate lethargy and bureaucratic style. In order to effectively overcome the "three bad styles" and rectify the work style, we must resolutely implement the central government's decision on streamlining institutions and transferring cadres to participate in labor training. We held a conference to mobilize the transfer, and cadres responded enthusiastically. We plan to transfer 23,000 people.

Facts have proved that a new upsurge in production and construction in Guangzhou is gradually forming. For example, the original plan for the South China Sewing Machine Factory to produce sewing machines this year was 50,000 units. After mobilizing the masses for several discussions, it was increased to 60,000 units, and later increased to 70,000 units; the Xiehe Machine Factory, through discussions at the职工代表大会, revised the production plan, which increased the total output value by 34.5 percent compared with the original plan issued by the state, and increased by 46 percent compared with the actual performance completed last year. Under such favorable circumstances, we are actively organizing the city's workers and masses, taking advantage of the long wind of the rectification movement, to comprehensively and deeply carry out socialist competition, compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and set off a lively socialist advanced producer (worker) movement, so that Guangzhou's production in 1958 will have a great leap forward!

Fellow delegates! The work tasks in Guangzhou in 1958 are very arduous and glorious. We have full confidence and determination to do a good job in the above aspects and complete and overfulfill this year's production tasks. We have been vigilant. We are not officials, we are not enjoying ourselves, we are doing revolution, we are doing socialist revolution, we are doing a great cause that predecessors have never done before. We are always with the masses, uniting the masses, learning from the masses, and bringing into play the infinite wisdom and strength of the masses. Under the wise leadership of our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will surely overcome all difficulties and ride the wind and waves forward, moving from victory to victory!

    把广州建设成为社会主义工业的城市
    朱光代表的发言
    1957年经济、政治、思想战线上的伟大成就
    我完全同意大会所作的各项工作报告，并建议大会通过。现在，让我就广州市的工作，作一个简单的发言。
    一年来，广州市和全国各地一样胜利地开展了全民整风运动和反击资产阶级右派的斗争，这是社会主义革命继一九五六年经济战线上取得决定性胜利之后，又在政治战线上和思想战线上取得的伟大胜利。广州市第一个五年计划，也超额完成了，一九五七年全市工业总产值达到十二亿九千万元，（按一九五二年不变价格计算，下同）比一九五六年增长百分之十一，其中地方工业（包括手工业）达到九亿九千万元，比一九五六年增长百分之十二；郊区农副业总产值达到三千二百万元，比一九五六年增长百分之八；全地区基建投资达一亿三千万元，其中市属五千万元，比一九五六年增长百分之一百一十八；全社会商品零售总额达到七亿一千万元，比一九五六年增长百分之十五；交通运输、城市建设、文教卫生等事业都有很大的发展，人民生活也有了显著的改善。
    但是，我们在去年的工作中，也存在不少缺点，最主要是存在右倾保守思想，在反右派斗争之前对人民内部矛盾与敌我矛盾的界线理解模糊，因而曾经放松了对资产阶级思想及资本主义倾向的斗争，放松了对资产阶级分子的改造工作，对群众建设社会主义的积极性和加速建设的有利条件估计不足，对困难估计过多，指标订得保守。加以在处理发展生产和改善生活的关系上，有些地方片面强调了对群众生活的照顾，忽视了对群众进行艰苦奋斗的教育，以致影响人们往往只看眼前利益而缺乏远大理想，没有把群众的劲头鼓起来。此外，对勤俭建国、多快好省的方针，我们也体会不深，贯彻不够，白手成家的精神还没有树立起来。如果我们没有这些右倾保守思想，群众的积极性充分地发挥出来，那末，去年的成绩就一定会更大。
    各种主要轻工业、纺织工业和机电工业的产品质量，争取五年赶上全国先进水平。
    目前，整个形势对我们加速社会主义建设是非常有利的。整风运动和反右派斗争大大提高了广大群众的社会主义觉悟，生产积极性也普遍高涨，一个新的生产建设高潮正在全市范围内逐步形成。因此，我们有信心、有决心在第二个五年计划期间加速把广州建成为社会主义工业生产城市。根据中央所提出的在优先发展重工业的基础上实行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，以及在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国这个总的要求和任务，我们计划在今后五年内把广州全市工业总产值提高一倍左右，即一九六二年达到二十五亿元，新建、扩建二十二个限额以上的工业建设项目和对原有工业进行有系统的全盘的技术改造。现在，年产生铁三十四万吨的钢铁厂、年产硫酸铵二十一万吨的氮肥厂、年产烧碱一万五千吨的电解化工厂和年产发动机五万匹马力的内燃机厂，已经开始建设，我们还计划五年内进行造纸、人造纤维、麻织、绢纺、塑料等工厂的建设。这些建设项目和原有工业的技术改造完成后，广州市的工业生产水平和技术水平将跃进一大步，可以为省内农业、渔业和水利建设提供化学肥料、细菌肥料、农药和各种动力机械和农具，为工业生产提供充足的钢铁、酸、碱等工业原料和机械设备，为改善广大人民生活和出口贸易提供大量的日用品工业和食品工业产品。我们还要积极改进工业生产的技术，争取各种主要的轻工业、纺织工业和机电工业的产品质量，在五年内赶上全国先进地区的水平，并争取电池、力车胎、立德粉、缝纫机等产品的质量赶上或超过英国的水平。在第二个五年计划期间，根据全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的精神，广州市郊区农业继续执行为城市服务和发展多种经营的方针，争取在两年内彻底消灭旱灾和普遍性水灾，三年内水稻亩产千斤，五年内更增至一千二百斤，五年内甘蔗亩产二万斤。一九六二年每户养猪平均达到十头，全部农业社的生产和社员收入超过上中农的水平，使广州市郊区变成蔬菜之乡、水果之乡、乳肉之乡、花木之乡，成为供应城市副食品和工业原料的重要基地。
    随着生产建设事业的发展，人民生活将得到进一步的改善。我们计划在两年内解决广州市的就业问题，五年内扫除文盲和普及小学教育，三年内消灭“四害”，两年内实现全面绿化和全市下水道的整理工作。市郊的白云山将建设水利工程，遍植经济林木，成为花果山。此外，我们还准备在五年内进行联系珠江两岸的第二道桥——西南大铁桥的建设。这样，位于祖国南方大门的广州市，将成为工业生产发达，经济文化繁荣，市容整洁美观的社会主义工业生产城市。实现这个计划，不仅是广州市人民多年来的愿望，也是广州市人民一个艰巨而光荣的任务。
    一九五八年是我国第二个五年计划的头一年，根据我国胜利完成第一个五年计划的经验，完成五年计划的关键在开头的三年，而这三年中最要紧的又是头一年。因此，广州市在一九五八年必须进一步贯彻勤俭建国和多快好省的方针，克服右倾思想，鼓起革命干劲，彻底打掉官气，掀起一个生产建设的高潮，为第二个五年计划的执行创造一个良好的开端。
    工业生产方面，今年必须尽最大努力积极发挥工业生产潜力，从根本上改变广州市工业产品质量低、成本高的现状，这是我们今年努力的一个方向。全市工业、手工业总产值预计比去年增长百分之十五，并力争达到百分之二十以上。在主要产品，如变压器、蓄电池、扩音机、搪瓷制品、电筒、电池、汽灯、胶鞋、炭酸钙、葡萄糖、卫生衣裤等的质量和花色品种上，我们要向上海学习和向他们看齐；个别品种如制糖机器更要赶上国际水平；并试制和仿制各种新产品要求达到一千种以上（如细菌肥料、甘蔗培土机、水轮机、橡胶促进剂、合成树胶、空气电池、微空橡胶、棉麻布等）。我们决心千方百计地改进企业管理，提高劳动生产率，预计成本将比去年降低百分之五至七，争取降低百分之十。广州市地方工业的生产潜力是很大的，根据最近对机电、轻工、食品、化工等六个行业、十五个工厂的调查，初步估算只要投资五百三十六万元，增加一些厂房或添置一些设备，生产品产值就可以增加三千九百万元，比原来增加百分之六十五点三，还可增加工人二千一百九十七人，每年利润可达到八百二十一万元，即是说全部投资在八个月内便可以收回。因此，按照投资少、收效大的原则，对原有企业进行技术改造，是完全必要的。计划今年投资二十万元以下五万元以上进行改建、扩建的企业达二十三个，这对于扩大产品产量、提高质量将起很大的作用。
    基本建设方面：今年投资总额比一九五七年增加百分之二十五，继续施工或开始兴建的项目共有二十八个，计有限额以上的九个，其中规模宏大，设备现代化的工厂如年产二十一万吨肥田料（硫酸铵）的氮肥厂、年产生铁三十四万吨的钢铁厂和二万锭的苎麻纺织厂等，均已开工兴建，并有日榨甘蔗二千吨的华侨糖厂、年产罐头二万吨的罐头厂等将在今年投入生产。这些厂的建成将改变广州市原有经济的落后面貌，对支援农业生产大发展和扩大工业品的出口都有极重大的作用。
    郊区水稻亩产八百斤，甘蔗亩产一万二千斤。
    郊区农业生产方面，今年努力的方向仍是大力发展粮食生产，以期迅速达到先进地区的生产水平。预计水稻每亩产量将达到八百斤，甘蔗亩产量达到一万二千斤，其它经济作物的单位面积产量都比去年提高，预计今年郊区农副业总产值比去年增长百分之十一以上，争取在两年内使每个农业社员的收入达到上中农的水平。为此，郊区在今年内计划兴修大小水利工程二千五百零五宗，务期今年内消灭普通旱灾，开展每亩积肥万斤运动，在今春雨季之前，组织机关干部、青年学生和市民参加劳动，开发近郊地占广州市区一半的白云山，建造二十四座大小水塘，根治山洪、防止水土流失，灌溉农田六千多亩。这些措施对发展郊区农副业及各种经济作物的生产意义很大。
    与上述工农业大跃进的要求相适应，今年全社会商品零售额预计增长百分之四点三四，运输量增长百分之九点三三。
    五年内扫除文盲，三年内消灭四害。
    文化教育方面：计划今年中学招生比去年增加九千人，除了继续推行二部制、增加班次、鼓励群众办学外，并推行勤工俭学、半工半读的办法。继续开展扫盲运动，今年内组织全市文盲半文盲入学人数比去年增加百分之四十六点八，争取五年内扫除文盲。同时，继续开展群众性的文化艺术和体育活动。
    卫生事业方面：大力开展群众的爱国卫生运动，除了争取三年内消灭四害之外，争取做到“六无”（无尘土、无污水、无垃圾、无粪便、无口痰、无脏物）；提倡计划生育，控制城市人口的增加。
    变街道为花园，变荒山为林地
    城市建设方面：主要以彻底改造上水道（包括西关涌、西濠涌等）为重点，争取在两年内解决濠沟污臭和潮水浸淹问题。计划在今年内全面开展全市绿化工作，逐步变街道为花园，变近郊和郊区干道为林带，变各类荒山荒地为林地和花果园。
    比先进，学先进，赶先进，迎接1958年生产大跃进。
    为了鼓起革命干劲，加速广州市的社会主义建设，按照勤俭建国和多快好省的方针，掀起群众性的生产建设高潮，保证一九五八年各项计划指标和工作任务的胜利完成，我们必须把全民整风运动作为推动一切工作的动力，作为“提起一切工作的纲”，把整风和社会主义教育运动搞深、搞透、搞好，争取今年上半年在各个战线上取得全民整风运动的完全胜利。为了进一步发挥群众生产的积极性，实现社会主义建设事业的大跃进，我们党和政府领导干部首先必须坚决克服右倾保守思想，打掉暮气官风。为了有效地克服“三个坏主义”整顿作风，必须坚决贯彻中央关于精简机构、下放干部参加劳动锻炼的决定。我们开了大会动员下放，干部纷纷响应，我们打算下放二万三千人。
    事实证明，目前广州市新的生产建设高潮正在逐步形成，例如，华南缝纫机制造厂原订今年生产缝纫机计划为五万台，经过发动群众数次讨论，提高到六万台，后来，又增至七万台；协同和机器厂通过职工代表大会的讨论，修订生产计划的结果，使总产值比原来国家下达的计划提高百分之三十四点五，比去年完成的实绩增长百分之四十六。在这样有利的形势下，我们正在乘着整风运动的长风积极组织全市职工群众，全面地深入地开展社会主义竞赛，比先进、学先进、赶先进，掀起热火朝天的社会主义先进生产者（工作者）运动，使广州市一九五八年的生产来一个大跃进！
    各位代表！一九五八年广州市的工作任务是非常艰巨而光荣的，我们完全有信心和决心做好以上各方面工作，完成和超额完成今年的生产任务。我们已经警惕着，我们不是在做官，我们不是在享福，我们是在干革命，是在干社会主义革命，是在干前人所未干过的伟大的事业，我们时刻和群众在一起，团结群众，向群众学习，把群众无穷无尽的智慧和力量发挥出来，在我们党中央和毛主席英明领导下，我们必能克服一切困难，乘风破浪前进，从胜利走向胜利！
