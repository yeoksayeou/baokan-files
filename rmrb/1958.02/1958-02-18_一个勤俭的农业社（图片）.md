    A Frugal and Thrifty Agricultural Cooperative

    The Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative of Xizhaomulian, Yongnian County, Hebei Province, has achieved increased production year after year by implementing the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily. At present, 98.2% of the cooperative members have reached or exceeded the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants before the establishment of the cooperative. Since this cooperative transitioned to an advanced cooperative in 1955, it has never borrowed money from the state and has also adhered to the principle of spending less and accomplishing more in terms of capital construction. For example, dozens of livestock sheds and warehouses were built using old timber from within the cooperative. The cooperative's grain production increase target for this year is an average of 450 jin per mu, and the cotton yield (seed cotton) is 320 jin per mu. To ensure the realization of this plan, all cooperative members are vigorously accumulating fertilizer and building water conservancy projects. In terms of fertilizer, it is required to apply more than 10,000 jin of crude fertilizer per mu. In terms of water conservancy, in addition to the existing 48 brick wells, five more mechanized wells will be dug and five 10-horsepower or more portable steam engines will be purchased.

    The bad carts that could no longer be used have been revitalized after being repaired by the cooperative members themselves.
    In order to ensure a bumper harvest, five more mechanized wells must be dug before spring plowing. The cooperative members are actively preparing materials.
    In these more than 700 mu of high-yield land, an average of 1,000 jin of wheat per mu will be strived for. This is the scene of the cooperative members applying urea fertilizer.

    一个勤俭的农业社
    河北永年县西赵目连五星农业生产合作社，由于贯彻执行了勤俭办社的方针，连年获得增产。目前全社已有98.2％的社员达到或超过办社前富裕中农的生活水平。这个社自从1955年转入高级社以来，从未向国家贷过款，并在基本建设方面也掌握了少支出多办事的原则。如利用社内的旧木料盖了几十间牲口房和仓库。这个社今年的粮食增产指标平均每亩是四百五十斤，棉花亩产（籽棉）三百二十斤。为了保证这个计划的实现，全体社员正在大力积肥和兴修水利。肥料方面要求每亩施粗肥一万斤以上。水利方面除现有四十八眼砖井外，再打五眼机井和购置十马力以上的锅驼机五部。

    坏的已经不能使用的大车，经过社员自己修理后，又得到了新生。
    为了确保大丰收，在春耕前还要打好五眼机井。社员们正在积极地筹备器材。
    在这七百多亩丰产地里，每亩平均要争取收获一千斤小麦。这是社员们在施尿肥的情形。
