Better Learning from the Soviet Army
Marshal Ye Jianying's Broadcast Speech Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Soviet Army

Dear Comrades and Friends:

Today is the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army. The Chinese people and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army celebrate this glorious festival with boundless excitement. I extend warm congratulations to the Soviet people and the Soviet Army.

The glorious history of the Soviet armed forces over the past forty years is a history of moving from victory to victory, and a history of the victorious development of Marxist-Leninist military doctrine.

As early as the initial period of the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, when the first socialist country appeared in the world, the imperialist elements of all countries were frightened and hated it to the bone. Fourteen imperialist countries headed by Britain, the United States, and France launched armed intervention, attempting to cooperate with domestic counter-revolutionary forces to strangle the young Soviet state. In order to defend the young Soviet state, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin, the world's first new type of proletarian revolutionary army was established. This army, unprecedented in human history and possessing a strong revolutionary will, thoroughly crushed the attacks of foreign armed interventionists and domestic counter-revolutionary forces with inferior equipment, thereby defending the victorious achievements of the October Socialist Revolution.

During the Second World War, fascist Germany perfidiously launched a war of aggression against the Soviet Union. This was another severe test for the Soviet state, the Soviet people, and the Soviet army, following the civil war. The German fascist army was well-prepared before attacking the Soviet Union, had two years of combat experience in Western Europe, possessed the economic resources of almost all of Europe, and had the latest weapons and equipment. Therefore, it occupied large tracts of Soviet territory in the west soon after the war began. Nevertheless, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people, with full confidence, relied on their own powerful armed forces to once again crush the fascist offensive, defend the freedom and independence of their motherland, and liberate the people of many European countries from the ravages of fascism. After the great victory against fascism had just ended, the Soviet army turned its guns eastward and defeated the elite of the Japanese imperialist army in one fell swoop, thereby achieving the complete victory of the Second World War.

After the war, the Soviet army was not satisfied with these achievements. In the years of peaceful construction, it has made new and great achievements in consolidating national defense, developing military science, and improving the army's combat effectiveness.

As everyone knows, since the Second World War, especially in recent years, the Soviet Union has made epoch-making developments in science and technology, especially in nuclear physics, electronics, rocket technology, and radio, surpassing the United States at an astonishing speed and taking a leading position in the world. The recent successful launch of two artificial earth satellites by the Soviet Union powerfully confirms this.

The Soviet army has made full use of all achievements in science and technology. The Soviet army has been fully motorized and mechanized. Its conventional weapons are becoming increasingly sophisticated. It not only possesses various types of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, but also possesses various short-range and long-range rockets capable of carrying atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, as well as intercontinental ballistic rockets that can reach any corner of the world.

The Soviet Communist Party and the government have paid great attention to strengthening party and political work in the army and to developing military science while continuously strengthening the Soviet army's equipment. Based on the experience of the Second World War, especially the experience of the Soviet Great Patriotic War, and the experience of post-war army training, the Soviet army has further developed Soviet military science, making it adapt to the new conditions of modern warfare to the greatest extent. Soviet military science has become a relatively complete knowledge system about the laws of modern warfare.

Now, the Soviet army is not only the world's first revolutionary army educated with communist ideas and possessing a high degree of organization and discipline, but also the world's first modern army armed with the best technical weapons and the most advanced military science. The existence of this heroic and powerful army is not only a reliable guarantee for the Soviet Union to carry out peaceful construction, but also an important factor in defending world peace and preventing war.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always taken the Soviet army as its model since its birth. This is primarily because the armies of China and the Soviet Union are both revolutionary armies of the same type, have common political ideals, and are guided by Marxist-Leninist military doctrine in military affairs; secondly, the Soviet army is the world's first and best modern revolutionary army. Its combat experience is the most complete and richest, and its military science is the most advanced; thirdly, the Soviet army has a high degree of internationalism. It has given infinite sympathy and concern to the struggle of people around the world for independence and liberation. It follows the Soviet government's peace policy, gets along with the people of all countries in a friendly manner, and provides sincere and selfless help to brotherly countries and other friendly countries. Therefore, as the fundamental direction for our army's learning, we must earnestly learn from the experience of the Soviet army. Of course, we do not exclude absorbing the beneficial military experience of other countries.

Our learning from the Soviet army mainly involves learning from the Soviet army's basic experience in military construction, such as: in politics, ensuring the absolute leadership of the Party in the army; establishing a revolutionary political work system, strengthening ideological work, and constantly improving the socialist consciousness of all members; maintaining close ties with the masses, and ensuring close unity between superiors and subordinates, officers and soldiers, and the army and the people. In military affairs, gradually improving the army's technical equipment based on the foundation of socialist industrialization, and enabling the army to be good at conducting operations under modern conditions, etc. Although the situation of our Chinese People's Liberation Army is not exactly the same as that of the Soviet army, and there are certain differences in the army's traditions, habits, and other aspects, this does not affect our earnest learning from the Soviet army. It should be affirmed that a large amount of the Soviet army's universal experience is fully applicable to our army. Of course, we must also be good at learning and applying these experiences creatively from the actual situation.

The regularization and modernization of the Chinese People's Liberation Army only began after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. After only eight years, the army has developed from a single-service branch into a combined arms army, and has also built a substantial air force and navy. At present, this army already has sufficient ability to assume the sacred responsibility of defending the motherland. But we must never be satisfied with this. Under the leadership of the Party, the government, and Comrade Mao Zedong, we must continue to work hard and strive to build our army into an excellent modern revolutionary army in about ten years.

Dear friends and comrades!

The friendship between the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable. The friendly exchanges between the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union are increasing day by day. Not long ago, at the invitation of the Soviet Ministry of Defense, I accompanied the Chinese military friendship delegation to visit the Soviet people and their army. Through a visit of less than a month, we have more deeply realized the profound friendship between the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union. I firmly believe that this fraternal friendship will be increasingly consolidated and developed with the passage of time.

    更好地向苏联军队学习
    叶剑英元帅庆祝苏军建军四十周年的广播词亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    今天是苏联军队建军四十周年。中国人民和中国人民解放军全体官兵都怀着无限兴奋的心情，庆祝这个光荣的节日。我谨向苏联人民和苏联军队致热烈的祝贺。
    苏联武装力量四十年的光荣历史，是从胜利走向胜利的历史，是马列主义军事学说胜利发展的历史。
    早在伟大十月社会主义革命胜利的初期，当世界上出现了第一个社会主义国家的时候，世界各国的帝国主义分子吓得心惊胆寒，恨之入骨，以英、美、法为首的十四个帝国主义国家发动了武装干涉，企图配合国内的反革命势力，扼杀年青的苏维埃国家。为了捍卫年青的苏维埃国家，在以列宁为首的布尔什维克党领导下，建立了世界上第一支新型的无产阶级革命军队。这支人类历史上前所未有的具有旺盛革命意志的军队，以劣势装备彻底粉碎了外国武装干涉军和国内反革命势力的进攻，从而捍卫了十月社会主义革命的胜利果实。
    第二次世界大战期间，法西斯德国背信弃义地发动了对苏联的侵略战争。这是继国内战争之后对苏维埃国家、苏联人民和军队的又一次严重考验。德国法西斯军队在进攻苏联之前，早有准备，有在西欧两年作战的经验，有几乎整个欧洲的经济资源，有最新式的武器装备，因而在战争开始后不久就占领了苏联西部的大片国土。尽管如此，苏联人民在苏联共产党领导下，仍然信心百倍地依靠着自己强大的武装力量，又一次粉碎了法西斯的进攻，捍卫了自己祖国的自由和独立，并把欧洲许多国家的人民从法西斯的蹂躏下解放出来。在反法西斯的伟大胜利刚刚结束之后，苏联军队又挥戈东向，一举击溃了日本帝国主义军队的精锐，从而取得了第二次世界大战的彻底胜利。
    战后，苏联军队并没有满足所取得的这些成就。在和平建设的年代里，在巩固国防、发展军事科学和提高军队战斗力方面，取得了新的巨大成就。
    大家知道，在第二次世界大战以后，特别是最近几年来，苏联在科学技术方面有了划时代的发展，特别是核子物理学、电子学、火箭技术以及无线电等方面，以惊人的速度超过了美国而在世界上处于领先的地位。不久前苏联发射两颗人造地球卫星的成功，更有力地证实了这一点。
    苏联军队充分利用了科学技术方面的一切成就。苏联军队已完全摩托化、机械化，它的常规武器日臻完善，不仅拥有各种类型的原子武器和氢武器，而且拥有能装载原子武器和氢武器的各种近程和远程火箭，以及能射达世界任何角落的洲际弹道火箭。
    苏联共产党和政府，在不断加强苏军装备的同时，对于加强军队中的党、政工作，对于发展军事科学，给予了极大的注意。苏联军队根据第二次世界大战，特别是苏联伟大卫国战争的经验以及战后军队训练的经验，更进一步向前发展了苏联的军事科学，使之最大限度地适应现代战争的新条件。苏联军事科学已成为一套比较完整的关于现代战争规律的知识体系。
    现在，苏联军队不仅是世界上第一支以共产主义思想教育出来的、具有高度组织性和纪律性的革命军队，而且也是世界上第一支以最优良的技术兵器和最先进的军事科学武装起来的现代化军队。这支英勇强大的军队的存在，不仅是苏联进行和平建设的可靠保证，而且也是保卫世界和平和制止战争的重要因素。
    中国人民解放军自诞生之日起，一直就以苏联军队作为自己的榜样。这首先是因为中苏两国军队都属于同一类型的革命军队，有共同的政治理想，在军事上都是以马列主义军事学说为指南；其次，苏联军队是世界上第一支最优良的现代化的革命军队，它的作战经验最完整、最丰富，其军事科学也最先进；再次，苏联军队具有高度的国际主义精神，它对世界各国人民争取独立、解放的斗争给予无限同情和关怀，它遵循着苏联政府的和平政策，同各国人民友好相处，对兄弟国家以及其他友好国家给予真诚无私的帮助。所以，作为我军学习的根本方向来说，必须认真地学习苏军的经验，当然我们也并不排斥吸取其他国家的有益的军事经验。
    我们学习苏联军队，主要是学习苏军在军事建设中的基本经验，如：在政治上，保证党在军队中的绝对领导；建立革命的政治工作制度，加强思想工作，不断地提高全体成员的社会主义觉悟；保持与群众的密切联系，保证上下之间、官兵之间、军民之间的亲密团结。在军事上，依据社会主义工业化的基础逐步改善军队的技术装备，并使军队善于在现代条件下进行作战等。尽管我们中国人民解放军的情况与苏联军队不完全相同，军队的传统、习惯等方面也有某些差异，但这并不影响我们认真向苏军学习。应该肯定，苏军大量的带有普遍性的经验是完全适用于我们的军队的。当然我们还要善于从实际出发，创造性地学习和运用这些经验。
    中国人民解放军的正规化和现代化的建设是从1949年中华人民共和国宣告成立后才开始的。经过短短八年时间，陆军已由单一兵种建设成为一支诸兵种合成军队，同时还建设成一支具有相当规模的空军和海军。目前，这支军队已经具有足够能力担负起保卫祖国的神圣职责。但我们绝不能因此而满足。在党、政府和毛泽东同志的领导下，我们要继续发愤努力，争取在十年左右的时间内，把我军建设成为一支优良的现代化革命军队。
    亲爱的朋友们，同志们！
    中、苏两国人民及其军队的友谊是牢不可破的。中、苏两国人民和军队的友好往来与日俱增。不久前，应苏联国防部的邀请，我曾随中国军事友好访苏代表团访问了苏联人民及其军队。通过不到一个月时间的访问，使我们更深刻地体会到中苏两国人民和军队的深厚友谊。我深信，这种兄弟般的友谊将随着时间的前进日益巩固和发展。
