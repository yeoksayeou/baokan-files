Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 1st: The government of the German Democratic Republic issued an important statement here today, expressing its full support for the Soviet government's January 9th proposal to ease international tensions. The statement said that the GDR government fully agrees with the Soviet government's initiative to hold a meeting of heads of government to discuss the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe.

The statement pointed out that the main danger at present lies in the Bonn government dragging West Germany into the nuclear arms race of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and preparing for atomic warfare. This not only intensifies the situation in Germany, but also greatly increases the threat to peace and security in Europe. The GDR government believes that the most urgent issue is that both German states must stop all forms of nuclear armament and refuse to store nuclear weapons, in order to eliminate the danger of nuclear war in the center of Europe.

The statement said that the Polish plan, supported by the Soviet government, to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe provides the German people and all of Europe with the possibility of moving towards easing tensions and peaceful coexistence. So far, three of the four countries directly related to this plan, namely the GDR, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, have unanimously expressed their willingness to undertake corresponding obligations for the nuclear-weapon-free zone plan. Now it only remains for the West German government to express its agreement with this peace plan. Therefore, the West German government will bear full responsibility for whether this important step to ease the European situation can succeed. And if a referendum were held in East and West Germany on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, the West German government would be completely isolated.

The statement continued that the GDR government also fully supports the Soviet government's proposal for the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the member states of the Warsaw Pact to conclude a treaty of non-aggression. Concluding such a treaty would be of great significance for averting the danger of Germans killing each other. It would be warmly welcomed by all peace-loving Germans. In addition, the Soviet proposal for East and West to negotiate on the reduction and withdrawal of foreign troops from the territories of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states and the Warsaw Pact member states, especially from German territory, is also welcomed by the German people.

The statement pointed out that if the outcome of the summit meeting proposed by the Soviet government could lead to the end of the Cold War and the establishment of an atmosphere of mutual trust, it would undoubtedly help Germany regain unity on a peaceful and democratic basis.

The statement reiterated that, given the existence of two German states, the peaceful reunification of Germany can only be achieved through mutual understanding between the two German states; and the only viable path is for the two German states to form a confederation.

### 民主德国支持苏联和平新倡议  指斥西德当局进行原子战争的准备

　　民主德国支持苏联和平新倡议
    指斥西德当局进行原子战争的准备
    新华社柏林1日电　这里今天公布了德意志民主共和国政府的一项重要声明，这个声明对苏联政府1月9日关于缓和国际紧张局势的建议表示完全支持。声明说，民主德国政府完全赞同苏联政府关于举行各国政府首脑会议来讨论建立欧洲无原子武器区的倡议。
    声明指出，目前主要危险在于波恩政府把西德拖进了北大西洋集团的原子扩军竞赛，进行着原子战争的准备。这不仅使德国的局势更加尖锐化，而且大大加剧了对欧洲和平和安全的威胁。民主德国政府认为特别迫切的问题是：两个德国必须停止进行任何形式的原子武装并且拒绝存放原子武器，以便在欧洲中心消除原子战争的危险。
    声明说，受到苏联政府支持的关于建立中欧无原子武器区的波兰计划给德国人民和整个欧洲提供了导向紧张局势缓和及和平共处的可能性。迄今为止，同这个计划有直接关系的四个国家中，已经有三个国家，即民主德国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克一致表示愿为无原子武器区的计划承担相应的义务。现在只待西德政府对这个和平计划表示同意。因此，这个争取缓和欧洲局势的重要步骤能否成功，将要由西德负完全的责任。而如果在东西德就建立无原子武器区问题举行一次公民投票，西德政府将会完全陷于孤立。
    声明接着说，民主德国政府也充分支持苏联政府关于由北大西洋集团成员国同华沙条约成员国缔结互不侵犯条约的建议。缔结这样的条约对于排除德国人自相残杀的危险具有巨大意义。它将会受到所有爱好和平的德国人的衷心欢迎。另外，苏联关于东西方就从北大西洋集团成员国和华沙条约成员国领土上特别是从德国领土上减少和撤退外国军队的问题进行谈判的建议，也同样受到德国人民的欢迎。
    声明指出，如果由于苏联政府所建议的高级会议的结果而能导致冷战结束和相互信任气氛的建立，那无疑会有助于德国在和平民主的基础上重新获得统一。
    声明重申，鉴于两个德国的存在，德国和平统一的实现只能通过两个德国之间的相互谅解；而唯一可行的道路则是由两个德国国家成立邦联。
