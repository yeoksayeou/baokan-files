    We Have No Winter Here
    Bīngxīn
    The other day, I was with some friends, and everyone said that the climate in Beijing seems to be getting warmer and shorter every year, almost to the point of having no winter at all. We remember when we were little, the winters in Beijing were very long. At night, huddled in our quilts, we could always hear the howling, earth-rolling north wind, and the window paper sounded like ghosts screaming, howling all night long. Getting up early, carrying our schoolbags, braving the wind, and walking forward with our heads down, the snow in the dirt road, crushed by the wheels, was pressed into strips of muddy ruts. If you weren't careful and stepped into one, even your little cotton shoes would get stuck in the mud and you couldn't pull them out! In the doorways on both sides of the hutong, there were always several people huddled together, begging for food, picking up scraps... Their faces were frozen purple, their limbs trembling, their clothes hanging on their bodies like withered leaves, uttering intermittent groans. Seeing these suffering figures, we involuntarily walked faster, and just as we were "frantically choosing our way," our little cotton shoes would get stuck in the mud!
    So cold, huddled, muddy... after several long and gray-yellow months, suddenly, we felt agitated, took off our cotton clothes, and spring had already arrived! But after wearing our lined clothes for only a few days, we had to change into single-layer clothes again, and summer was already in sight. So we always said that Beijing had no spring.
    The winters of these past few years have been very different. Beijing still has wind and snow, but the snow that falls is neatly piled on both sides. On the smooth asphalt roads, the sun shines and the wind blows, and it's as if it never snowed at all. The most gratifying thing is that we no longer see those suffering figures or hear the sounds of groaning in the doorways. Coming out of there are men, women, old, and young going to school, going to work, going to the office, their clothes simple and clean, with peaceful smiles on their faces, walking forward with their heads held high and their chests out.
    Especially last year—1957—it was as if there was no winter. Although in terms of climate, there were winds, snows, and frozen rivers, we never heard the word "winter" mentioned in people's conversations. Terms like "dispelling the cold," "winter leisure," and "hibernation" have become outdated. At the very moment I am writing this, people have not yet taken off their cotton clothes, the ice on Beihai Lake has not yet melted, the grass is not yet green, and the willows are not yet green, but the spirit of spring has already permeated the city of Beijing!
    In fact, why is it limited to the suburbs of Beijing? In our vast and expansive homeland, in the hearts of 600 million people, winter has never come!
    It's not that winter has never come; in the fiery and surging revolutionary fervor, "five years to see three years, three years to see the first year, the first year to see the previous winter," we worked together in the fields, on the riverbanks, on the construction sites, and in... pulled spring forward by three months. The bright and warm spring in the hearts of the people has swallowed up the harsh winter.
    This is a great leap forward of thousands of years! From now on, winter has lost its traditional meaning and has become the prelude to spring!
    We don't need to, like the English poet Shelley, utter a soft consolation and expectation: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" We simply say in plain language: "We have no winter here!"
                              1958, 2, 20, Beijing.

    我们这里没有冬天
    冰心
    那天同几位朋友在一起，大家都说北京的气候，似乎一年比一年暖了，而且一年比一年短，几乎短到没有冬天。我们记得小的时候，北京的冬天长得很，夜中踡缩在被窝里，总听见呜呜的卷地的北风，窗纸像鬼叫一样，整夜地在呼啸。早起夹着书包，冒着风低着头向前走，土道当中被车轮碾过的雪，压成一条一条小沟似的烂泥，不小心一脚踩下去，连小棉鞋都陷在泥里，拔不出来！胡同两旁的门洞里，永远有几个踡伏着的人，要饭的，拣破烂的……冻得发紫的脸，颤抖的四肢，衣衫像枯叶一样，一片一片地挂在身上，嘴里发着断续的呻吟。看到这些痛苦的形象，我们脚下不自觉地走快了，就在我们“慌不择路”的时候，我们的小棉鞋就陷在泥里了！
    就这样地寒冷，踡缩，泥泞……过了悠长而灰黄的几个月，忽然间，我们身上觉得暴燥，把棉衣一脱，原来春天已经来到了！但是夹衣穿不到几天，又得换上单衣，原来夏天又在眼前了，所以我们总说是北京没有春天。
    这几年的冬天，大不相同了。北京照旧刮风下雪，而下过的雪都整齐地堆在两旁，光滑的柏油路上，太阳一晒，风一吹，就像没下过雪一般。最痛快的是：大门洞里再看不见那些痛苦的形象，听不到呻吟的声音。从那里出来的，是上学的，上工的，上班的男女老幼，衣履朴素而整洁，嘴边带着宁静的微笑，昂首挺胸地往前走。
    尤其是去年——1957年，就仿佛没有冬天。虽然在气候上，也刮过风，下过雪，冻过河，但是在人们口中，就没有听见过“冬天”两个字，什么“消寒”，“冬闲”，“冬眠”，都成了过了时的词汇。就在我执笔之顷，人们身上的棉衣还没有脱，北海的冰也没有化，草也没有青，柳也没有绿，而春意早已弥漫在北京的城市了！
    其实，又何止是北京城郊？在我们辽阔广大的国土上，六万万人民的心里，冬天就没有来过！
    也不是冬天没有来过，在如火如潮的革命干劲里，“五年看三年，三年看头年，头年看前冬”，我们同心协力地在田野上，在河滩上，在工地上，在……把春天往前拉了三个月，人民心里光明温暖的春天，把严冬给吞没了。
    这是几千年来的一个大跃进！从此冬天失去了它传统的意义，它变成了春天的前奏！
    我们不必像英国的诗人雪莱那样，吟一句软软的慰籍和企望的：“冬天来了，春天还会遥远么？”我们干脆说一句大白话：“我们这里没有冬天！”
                              1958，2，20北京。
