Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Currently, many factories and mines, while deeply carrying out the rectification movement, have seen new production upsurges. How to promote this new production upsurge to develop more broadly and deeply is the central topic discussed at a recent mass production symposium held by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

The meeting, after analyzing the situation of the new upsurge, believed that with the gradual formation of a nationwide production upsurge, trade union organizations must proactively strengthen specific work in mass production to promote its development in a more in-depth and sustained direction. The meeting pointed out that at present, trade union organizations at all levels must pay attention to and strengthen the following aspects of work:

(1) Continue to deeply carry out the rectification movement. In particular, trade union organizations in enterprises that have not yet undergone in-depth rectification and major debates must help the enterprise administration to carry out the rectification to the end and resolutely improve production management work. At the same time, it is necessary to implement the policy of "no delay in rectification and production" so as to organize the workers' enthusiasm for labor into production in a timely manner and play a greater role.

(2) Fully implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. At present, in implementing this policy, trade union organizations must first combine it with special criticism sessions against waste, mobilize the masses to fully expose various waste phenomena in enterprises, guide workers to put forward rationalization proposals for saving, and establish a system for supervising and preventing waste. Secondly, it is necessary to mobilize workers to fight against all kinds of conservative ideas. Through discussions on this year's national plan, advanced production targets should be set.

(3) Use methods of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced to raise production to an advanced level. The meeting analyzed the differences between advanced and backward levels in many industries such as steel, coal, and cement, and pointed out that if the production of backward enterprises can be raised to the advanced level, the entire industrial production level can be greatly improved. The most important method to resolve the contradiction between advanced and backward is to continuously summarize and promote advanced experience. For this reason, it is necessary to conduct analysis and comparison frequently, organize backward units to visit advanced units, observe and demonstrate to each other, and specifically help backward units catch up with advanced units.

(4) Continue to guide and help workers improve technology, innovate technology, and learn and master new technologies. In the current production upsurge, on the one hand, trade unions must actively encourage bold trials of new products and the adoption of new technologies; on the other hand, they must summarize and promote various mass technical activities that can universally improve workers' skills, such as technical mutual aid and research societies. At the same time, the favorable opportunity of engineers and technicians going down to the workshops should be used to further promote the close integration of science and technology with workers' labor experience.

The meeting also emphasized that in order for trade union organizations to play a greater role in leading and promoting the production upsurge, trade unions themselves must also resolutely improve their work in the rectification movement, especially in improving the organization of competitions and evaluation and reward work.

Participants in this symposium included production department heads from national committees of various industrial trade unions, and some provincial and municipal trade union federations, as well as representatives from some grassroots trade unions.

### 深入开展整风运动  帮助职工提高技术  全总提出促进生产高潮的措施

　　深入开展整风运动  帮助职工提高技术
    全总提出促进生产高潮的措施
    据新华社9日讯　目前许多厂矿企业在深入开展整风运动的同时，新的生产高潮已经出现。怎样促进这个新的生产高潮更加广泛、深入地开展，这是中华全国总工会在最近召开的群众生产座谈会上讨论的中心议题。
    会议在分析了新高潮的形势以后认为，随着全国规模的生产新高潮的逐步形成，工会组织必须主动地加强群众生产方面的具体工作，促使它向着更加深入和持久的方向发展。会上指出当前各级工会组织必须注意和加强以下几个方面的工作：
    （一）继续深入地开展整风运动。特别是目前还没有经过深入整改和大辩论的企业的工会组织，必须帮助企业行政把整风进行到底，狠狠地改进生产管理工作。同时，要贯彻整风、生产两不误的方针，以便把职工的劳动热情及时组织到生产中去，发挥更大的作用。
    （二）要全面地贯彻勤俭建国和多快好省的方针。目前，工会组织在贯彻这一方针中，首先要结合反浪费的专题鸣放，发动群众充分揭发企业中的各种浪费现象，引导职工提出节约的合理化建议，建立监督和杜绝浪费的制度。其次要发动职工同各色各样的保守思想作斗争。通过讨论今年的国家计划，订出先进的生产指标。
    （三）用比先进、学先进、赶先进的方法，把生产提高到先进的水平上。会议分析了钢铁、煤炭、水泥等许多产业中存在着先进同落后之间的差异的情况，指出如果能够把落后企业的生产提高到先进的水平，就能使整个工业生产水平大大提高一步。解决先进同落后之间的矛盾的最重要的方法，就是不断地总结和推广先进经验。为此，就要经常地进行分析比较，组织落后单位到先进单位去参观访问，互相观摩表演，并且要具体地帮助落后单位迎头赶上先进单位。
    （四）继续引导和帮助职工提高技术、改进技术、学习和掌握新技术。在当前生产高潮中，工会一方面要积极鼓励大胆试制新产品和采用新技术的创举，另一方面要总结和提倡能够普遍提高职工技术的各种群众性的技术活动，如技术互助、研究会等。同时要利用工程技术人员下放到车间的有利机会，进一步促使科学技术同工人的劳动经验紧密地结合起来。
    会议还强调指出，为了使工会组织在领导和促进生产高潮中发挥更大作用，工会本身也要在整风中狠狠地改进工作，特别是要改进竞赛的组织工作和评比奖励等工作。
    参加这次座谈会的有各产业工会全国委员会和部分省市工会联合会的生产部长及某些基层工会的代表。
