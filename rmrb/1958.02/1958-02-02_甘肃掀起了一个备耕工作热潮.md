Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 30th -- A spring ploughing preparation work upsurge, characterized by strong momentum, rapid action, and numerous methods, has taken shape in various parts of Gansu Province.

The manure accumulation campaign in various parts of Gansu Province is still developing continuously. The hundreds of new manure accumulation methods created by farmers have greatly accelerated the speed of manure accumulation. The province has now accumulated more than 240 billion jin of fertilizer, reaching more than 78% of the annual fertilizer requirement, and many areas have reached more than 80%. Recently, the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture revised its fertilizer accumulation plan based on the high morale of the masses in accumulating fertilizer. The fertilizer application in the whole prefecture this year will be doubled compared to last year. In areas where fertilizer has basically been accumulated, people are continuing to accumulate fertilizer while transporting thousands of carts of manure to the fields to be sown. In the winter wheat growing areas of the Jing and Wei River basins, farmers have also applied "covering manure" to many winter wheat fields to ensure vigorous growth after the wheat seedlings turn green.

This year, the province's winter irrigation area reached more than 11 million mu, an increase of more than 4 million mu over last year. Some of the 5.24 million mu of newly built water fields in winter have already been irrigated. Farmers in the Zhangye area not only repaired canals early to ensure irrigation after spring sowing, but also broke with convention and launched a massive land leveling campaign. Currently, more than 1.5 million mu of land has been leveled in the entire area. In the arid areas of central Gansu, farmers are also spreading a lot of sandy soil to prevent drought. Some people carry ice from the river to fields that cannot be irrigated, ensuring seedlings and planting.

Since the beginning of winter, leading organs and agricultural cooperatives in various places have paid attention to livestock breeding and management. Many areas have built sheds, stored winter grass, and prevented and controlled livestock diseases to protect livestock from safely surviving the winter. Most agricultural cooperatives have basically achieved "protecting pregnant animals, ensuring the survival of young animals, and maintaining the condition of draft animals," reversing the phenomenon of draft animals being thin in winter, weak in spring, and even dying in previous years. Now, the province's more than 2.3 million draft animals have basically reached the stage of being fat and strong, and can be put into spring ploughing production in a timely manner.

Cadres in some areas have begun to cultivate experimental fields, and the masses have launched an upsurge in learning new production technologies. Seed adjustment and allocation of improved varieties are underway throughout the province. Supply and marketing departments have also supplied farmers with a large number of pesticides and new agricultural implements such as mountain plows and sowing machines. Many agricultural cooperatives are actively carrying out the inspection, repair and replenishment of farm tools. The leaders of some agricultural cooperatives and counties have conducted a comprehensive inspection of the spring ploughing preparations, and immediately corrected any slow progress or uneven development.

### 甘肃掀起了一个备耕工作热潮

　　甘肃掀起了一个备耕工作热潮
    新华社兰州30日电　一个劲头足、行动快、办法多的春耕准备工作热潮，已在甘肃省各地形成。
    甘肃省各地的积肥运动仍在不断发展，农民创造的数以百计的积肥新方法，大大加快了积肥速度。全省目前已积肥二千四百多亿斤，达到全年需肥量的78％多，许多地区达到80％以上。临夏回族自治州最近根据群众高昂的积肥情绪，重新修订了积肥计划。全州今年施肥量将比去年增加一倍。在已经基本上积足肥料的地区，人们一面继续积肥，一面正在把千车万担的肥粪送往将要播种的田里。泾渭河流域种冬麦地区，农民还给很多冬麦地施了“盖粪”，保证麦苗返青后生长旺盛。
    今年全省冬灌面积达到一千一百多万亩，比去年增加了四百多万亩。冬季新修成的五百二十四万亩水地，有些已经灌溉。张掖专区农民不但提早整修水渠，保证春播后浇灌，还打破惯例开展了一个声势浩大的平整田地运动，目前全专区已经平整田地一百五十多万亩。在甘肃中部干旱地区，农民还大量铺沙田防旱。有的把河内的冰背到不能浇灌的田地里，保?保种。
    入冬以来，各地领导机关和农业社都注意了牲畜的饲养管理，很多地区搭修棚圈、储备冬草和防治牲畜疫病，保护牲畜安全过冬。大多数农业社都基本上做到了“孕畜保胎、幼畜保活、耕畜保膘”，扭转了历年来耕畜冬瘦、春乏甚至死亡的现象。现在全省二百三十多万头耕畜，基本上达到膘肥体壮，可以及时投入春耕生产。
    有些地区的干部已开始培育试验田，群众展开学习新的生产技术热潮。全省各地正在进行籽种调剂、优良品种的调拨工作。供销部门还给农民供应了大批的农药和山地步犁、播种机等新式农具。许多农业社在积极进行农具的检修和添补。有些农业社和县的领导上已对备耕工作进行了全面的检查，发现进展迟缓和不平衡的现象，立即作了纠正。
