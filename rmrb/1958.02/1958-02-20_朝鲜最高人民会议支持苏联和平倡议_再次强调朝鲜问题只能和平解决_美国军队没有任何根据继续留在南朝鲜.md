Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 19th. The Second Session of the Second Korean Supreme People's Assembly passed a resolution today stating that the Chinese government's complete support for the Korean government's February 5th statement, and the proposal made by the Chinese and Korean government delegations in today's joint statement for the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from Korea, are of utmost importance for promoting the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and safeguarding peace in Asia.

The resolution, concerning support for the proposals and recommendations of the Supreme Soviet and the Soviet government on easing international tensions and maintaining and consolidating world peace, also emphasized that the Korean issue can only be resolved through peaceful means. The resolution stated that the Republic government's February 5th statement is not only the most realistic plan for the peaceful reunification of Korea, but its realization is also entirely in line with the cause of easing tensions in the Far East and consolidating world peace.

The resolution, after condemning the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique for refusing to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, turning South Korea into an American atomic base, and further escalating tensions in Korea, stated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea opposes such actions by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, and will continue to work to ensure the withdrawal of American aggressor troops and all other foreign troops from Korea, and to safeguard peace in Korea and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

The resolution said that the meeting believes that the realization of the Soviet Union's peace proposals will open the way for the peaceful resolution of pressing international issues and create extremely favorable conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea. The meeting emphasized that the various peace proposals of the Soviet Union must be implemented, and first and foremost, a summit conference of the great powers should be convened without delay.

Prior to the adoption of this resolution, Kim Chang-man, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly, spoke at the meeting on this agenda item. He pointed out that the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea is an important measure to promote the realization of the peaceful reunification plan proposed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea government, which calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue by the Korean people according to their own will.

Kim Chang-man pointed out that the presence of American aggressor troops in South Korea and its war policy have become the fundamental reasons threatening peace in Korea and hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea. The US military has no basis or excuse to continue to be stationed in South Korea.

The Second Session of the Second Korean Supreme People's Assembly, which lasted for three days, closed today. The meeting adopted the 1958 state budget proposed by the Republican Cabinet yesterday. Today's meeting also approved the ordinances of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly.

    朝鲜最高人民会议支持苏联和平倡议
    再次强调朝鲜问题只能和平解决
    美国军队没有任何根据继续留在南朝鲜
    新华社平壤19日电　朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第二次会议今天通过决议说，中国政府对朝鲜政府2月5日声明的完全支持，以及今天朝中两国政府代表团在联合声明中提出的中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤出，对促进和平解决朝鲜问题和维护亚洲和平具有极其重要的意义。
    这项关于支持苏联最高苏维埃和苏联政府对缓和国际紧张局势、维护和巩固世界和平的决议和建议的决议，还强调指出朝鲜问题只能用和平方法来解决。决议说，共和国政府2月5日的声明不仅是和平统一朝鲜最现实的方案，而且它的实现完全符合缓和远东紧张局势和巩固世界和平的事业。
    决议在斥责了美国和李承晚集团拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，把南朝鲜变为美国原子基地，进一步加剧朝鲜紧张局势的行为后说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国反对美国和李承晚集团的这种行为，并且为使美国侵略军队和其他一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，为维护朝鲜的和平和和平统一祖国继续努力。
    决议说，会议认为，实现苏联的和平建议，将打开和平解决迫切的国际问题的道路，也为朝鲜的和平统一创造极其有利的条件。会议强调指出，苏联的各种和平建议一定要加以实现，首先是要毫不迟延地召开大国首脑会议。
    在通过这项决议之前，朝鲜最高人民会议外交委员会委员长金昌满在会议上就这项议程发了言。他指出，中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤出是促使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，由朝鲜人民根据自己的意志和平解决朝鲜问题的和平统一方案得以实现的重要措施。
    金昌满指出，美国侵略军队驻在南朝鲜和它的战争政策成为威胁朝鲜和平和阻挠朝鲜的和平统一的基本原因。美军没有任何根据和借口继续驻在南朝鲜。
    历时三天的朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第二次会议已经在今天闭幕。会议在昨天通过了共和国内阁提出的1958年国家预算。今天的会议还批准了最高人民会议常任委员会的政令。
