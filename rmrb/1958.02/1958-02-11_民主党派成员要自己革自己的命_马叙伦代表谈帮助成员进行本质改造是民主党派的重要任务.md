Democratic Party Members Must Revolutionize Themselves
Ma Xulun's Representative Speech on Helping Members Carry Out Essential Transformation as an Important Task of Democratic Parties

The democratic parties are still bourgeois parties with a dual nature. They have not yet become political forces truly serving socialism. That is to say, there is still a huge contradiction between their current state and their position in the country's political life and the tasks they undertake. If this contradiction is not resolved, it will not only affect the democratic parties' own inability to continue to move forward, but will also have negative effects that are unfavorable to the people and the cause of socialism.

I fully support the reports of Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and I suggest that this meeting adopt these reports.

Now I would like to talk about the general rectification campaign carried out by the democratic parties.

The democratic parties must thoroughly liquidate the rightist line through the general rectification campaign, resolutely correct the political direction, establish a leading core that firmly stands on the socialist position, isolate and divide the rightists, consolidate the leadership over the middle elements, and gradually make the democratic parties a political force serving socialism.

On the basis of the decisive victory of the struggle against the bourgeois rightists by the people of the whole country, including the democratic parties, the democratic parties are carrying out a general rectification campaign. This rectification is an important key to the essential transformation of the democratic parties and their members. Our democratic parties are an integral part of the people's democratic united front in our country. They are trusted by the Party and the people and have a certain position in the country's political life. All their activities should be conducive to socialism and the interests of the 600 million people. However, judging from the class basis of the democratic parties, their overall political tendencies, the political and ideological state of their members, and the large number of facts exposed in the struggle against the rightists, they are still bourgeois parties with a dual nature. They have not yet become political forces that truly serve socialism. That is to say, there is still a huge contradiction between their current state and their position in the country's political life and the tasks they undertake. If this contradiction is not resolved, it will not only affect the democratic parties' own inability to continue to move forward, but will also have negative effects that are unfavorable to the people and the cause of socialism. The fact is very clear: among the rightists who have been exposed, a large number are leaders and members of the democratic parties. They used the trust of the Party and the people in them, adhered to the decadent bourgeois stance, tampered with the political and organizational lines of the democratic parties, and attempted to restore capitalism. Taking advantage of the Party's rectification, they launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. But their calculations were completely wrong. As a result of their political contest with the working class, poor peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, they suffered a shameful defeat. Their reactionary words and deeds were thoroughly exposed and completely refuted, and they became pitiful creatures, abandoned by all and weeping in a corner. This is their just deserts. The victory of the anti-rightist struggle once again proves that the leadership of the great Party is unshakable; the people cannot be deceived; and the strength of socialism is incomparably strong.

At the same time, we should see that the criminal activities of the rightists have caused extremely bad political influence and extremely serious consequences for the democratic parties. During the period when the rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, some organizations of the democratic parties were manipulated and used by them, becoming tools for opposing the Party and socialism. Other organizations were more or less influenced by the rightists, once lost their political direction, and implemented the rightist line in organization. Therefore, we democratic parties must thoroughly liquidate the rightist line through the general rectification campaign, resolutely correct the political direction, establish a leading core that firmly stands on the socialist position, isolate and divide the rightists, consolidate the leadership over the middle elements, and gradually make our democratic parties a political force serving socialism.

The majority of the members of the democratic parties are still in an intermediate state. They are not wholeheartedly accepting the leadership of the Party and socialism, but are of two minds. Therefore, promoting members to break with the capitalist stand and establish the socialist stand is an important task in the rectification of the democratic parties.

Promoting members to break with the capitalist stand and establish the socialist stand is an important task in the rectification of the democratic parties. The majority of the members of the democratic parties have made progress to varying degrees through several years of self-education. They have a tendency to accept the leadership of the Party and support socialism. However, if measured by socialist standards, most people are still in an intermediate state politically. They have not yet fundamentally abandoned the bourgeois stand. They are not wholeheartedly accepting the leadership of the Party and socialism, but are of two minds. They always have many lingering memories of the old world, and they often feel out of place in the new society. Many people were either misled by the fallacies of the rightists when they launched a frenzied attack, or they resonated with the rightists on this issue or that issue, even echoing them, sympathizing with and supporting the rightists, or they had varying degrees of suspicion, resistance, and wavering about the leadership of the Party and socialism. This is their negative side. This negative side is closely connected with the rightists in thought. Only after the anti-rightist struggle did they gradually awaken and begin to draw a clear line between themselves and the rightists on major issues of principle. It can be seen that helping them transform their political stand is an urgent task.

Carrying out the essential transformation of breaking with the capitalist stand and establishing the socialist stand is a revolution of oneself and will inevitably cause a fierce shock and struggle in the depths of everyone's mind. Therefore, it is an arduous and complex task. However, the current situation and conditions are very favorable, and it can be done as long as we are determined to do it.

Carrying out the essential transformation of breaking with the capitalist stand and establishing the socialist stand is, in nature, a struggle between two roads and is a revolution of oneself. It will inevitably cause a fierce shock and struggle in the depths of everyone's mind. Therefore, this is also an extremely arduous and complex task. To accomplish this task, in addition to relying on the help of the organization, it mainly depends on the consciousness of each individual. In the past few years, I have often said that our democratic parties represent the legitimate interests of the upper petty bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, not to preserve and maintain this class, but to transform and eliminate this class. Now that I revisit these words, I feel that they are of more practical significance. China must take the socialist road. This is the most fundamental interest of the 600 million people and is an objective law that cannot be changed by anyone's will. Before 1956, the foothold of our bourgeois intellectuals was dependent on the capitalist economic base. This was still permissible under the historical conditions at that time. However, after the high tide of socialist transformation in 1956, the capitalist economic base of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois ideas has been basically eliminated. "When the skin is gone, what will the hair adhere to?" Therefore, only by resolving to carry out the essential transformation of breaking with the capitalist stand and establishing the socialist stand, and transforming oneself into a working-class intellectual, can one adapt to the development and requirements of this great era. This is the only bright future for our bourgeois intellectuals. Each of us should look forward and move forward with full confidence. Any stagnation or backwardness is a dead end.

How can we consider that we have initially completed the transformation of our stand? I think the most important sign should be: wholeheartedly accepting the leadership of the Party, and actively supporting the Party's various policies, guidelines, and instructions in practical actions rather than just in words; wholeheartedly taking the socialist road, and firmly believing in the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Not doubting or wavering under any circumstances; striving to improve working relationships in the work unit, especially political solidarity with Party member comrades; being able to consciously strengthen learning, especially the study of Marxist-Leninist theory; establishing correct labor views, and cultivating feelings of sharing weal and woe with the working people. All these can be done as long as we are determined to do them.

At present, the objective situation and conditions are very favorable for us to carry out essential transformation. The most basic condition is the leadership and care of the great Party for us. At the same time, after the anti-rightist struggle, we have all been tempered and improved to varying degrees, distinguished between right and wrong, and recognized the superiority of the socialist system and the importance of accepting the leadership of the Party. This shows that the victory of the anti-rightist struggle has already given us a starting point for our essential transformation. On this basis, we will carry out rectification and transform our political stand. As long as we are conscious, we will definitely be able to take a big step forward on the road to socialism. Of course, the transformation of political stand and thought needs to be carried out constantly. As the old saying goes, "flowing water does not become stale, and a door hinge does not become worm-eaten," which is exactly the reason. With the experience and training of this rectification, we will be in a better position to have a rectification every certain period in the future.

Looking back at the year 1957, the achievements made by the people of our country on all fronts under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao are brilliant. Through the large-scale anti-rightist struggle and the national rectification movement, we have achieved great victories on the political and ideological fronts. This victory, in turn, has promoted the victory on the economic front. The early and over-fulfillment of the first five-year plan has laid a preliminary foundation for China's socialist industrialization. The Party and the government have put forward the forty articles of the ten-year national agricultural development program and the goal of catching up with or surpassing Britain in the production of steel and important industrial products within fifteen years or more, which has been warmly supported by the people of the whole country. At present, the people of the whole country are launching a new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production with a hundredfold confidence and unprecedented revolutionary drive. The implementation of the second five-year plan will further promote new leaps forward on the economic front. In the face of such an exciting new situation, each of us feels proud to live in this great era. At the same time, this is also an encouragement to every member of our democratic parties. We should invigorate our spirits, muster our energy, strive for progress, and closely follow the socialist train forward.

Although I have been ill for a long time, the leap forward of the motherland under the leadership of the Party is shining on my excited mood at all times. I can't forget the rectification of the democratic parties even more, and I place infinite expectations on it. I am willing to work with the comrades of the democratic parties to strive to transform and transform the organization of the China Association for Promoting Democracy into a political force that truly serves socialism, and to transform ourselves into working-class intellectuals, to follow the Communist Party forever, to serve socialism wholeheartedly, in order to complete our glorious historical mission.

    民主党派成员要自己革自己的命
    马叙伦代表谈帮助成员进行本质改造是民主党派的重要任务
    民主党派还是具有两面性的资产阶级政党，它还没有成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。也就是说，它的现状跟它在国家政治生活中所处的地位和所担负的任务之间，还存在一个巨大的矛盾。这个矛盾不解决，不仅影响到民主党派本身无法继续前进，而且会产生不利于人民和社会主义事业的消极作用。
    我完全拥护彭真副委员长、李先念、薄一波副总理和吴玉章主任的报告，并建议这次会议通过这些报告。
    现在我想谈一谈民主党派开展一般整风的问题。
    民主党派必须通过一般整风，彻底清算右派路线，坚决端正政治方向，建立站稳社会主义立场的领导核心，孤立和分化右派，巩固对中间派的领导，使民主党派逐步成为为社会主义服务的政治力量
    在全国人民包括各民主党派在内，反击资产阶级右派的斗争取得决定性胜利的基础上，各民主党派正在开展一般整风。这个整风是民主党派及其成员进行本质改造的重要关键。我们民主党派是我国人民民主统一战线的组成部分，它受到党和人民的信任，在国家政治生活中有一定的地位，它的一切活动应该是有利于社会主义的，有利于六亿人民的利益的，但是，从民主党派的阶级基础、总的政治倾向、它的成员的政治思想状况以及在反右派斗争中所暴露出来的大量事实来看，它还是具有两面性的资产阶级性政党，它还没有成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。也就是说，它的现状跟它在国家政治生活中所处的地位和所担负的任务之间，还存在一个巨大的矛盾。这个矛盾不解决，不仅影响到民主党派本身无法继续前进，而且会产生不利于人民和社会主义事业的消极作用。事实很清楚，在被揭露出来的右派分子中，有一大批是民主党派的领导人和成员，他们利用党和人民对他们的信任，坚持腐朽的资产阶级立场，篡改民主党派的政治路线和组织路线，企图复辟资本主义，乘着党整风的机会，向党向社会主义发起了猖狂的进攻。但是他们的算盘完全打错了，他们跟工人阶级、贫苦农民和革命知识分子进行政治较量的结果，遭到了可耻的失败，他们的反动言行被彻底揭露和完全驳倒，变成了众叛亲离、向隅而泣的可怜虫。这是他们自食其果。反右派斗争的胜利再一次证明：伟大的党的领导是不可动摇的；人民是不可欺侮的；社会主义的力量是坚强无比的。
    同时，我们应该看到，右派分子的罪恶活动，给民主党派造成了极其恶劣的政治影响，和极其严重的后果。在右派向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的时期，民主党派的一部分组织曾经被他们所操纵利用，成为反党反社会主义的工具。还有一部分组织或多或少受了右派的影响，一度在政治上迷失了方向，在组织上执行了右派路线。因此我们民主党派必须通过一般整风，彻底清算右派路线，坚决端正政治方向，建立站稳社会主义立场的领导核心，孤立和分化右派，巩固对中间派的领导，使我们民主党派逐步成为为社会主义服务的政治力量。
    民主党派的多数成员还处于中间状态，他们对接受党的领导和社会主义还不是一心一意而是三心二意，因此促使成员破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场，是民主党派整风中的重要任务
    促使成员进行破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场，是民主党派整风中的重要任务。民主党派的大多数成员，经过几年来的自我教育，在不同程度上是有进步的，他们有接受党的领导和拥护社会主义的倾向。但是，如果以社会主义的标准去衡量，多数人在政治上还是处于中间状态的，他们基本上还没有抛弃资产阶级立场，他们对接受党的领导和社会主义还不是一心一意，而是三心二意的。他们对旧世界总有许多念念不忘，对新社会时时感到格格不入。有许多人在右派猖狂进攻的时候，或者被右派分子的谬论所迷惑。或者在这个问题或那个问题上同右派分子起了共鸣，甚至桴鼓相应，同情和支持右派分子，或者对党的领导和社会主义产生了不同程度的怀疑、抵触和动摇。这是他们消极的一面，这种消极的一面，同右派在思想上是息息相通的，经过反右派斗争，他们才逐渐觉醒过来，在大是大非问题上开始与右派划清界限。由此可见，帮助他们改造政治立场，是一项刻不容缓的任务。
    进行破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场的本质改造，是自己革自己的命，必然会在每个人的思想深处展开剧烈的震动和斗争，因此是一项艰苦复杂的任务。但是现在形势和条件非常有利，只要下决心去做是可以做到的
    进行破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场的本质改造，在性质上是属于两条道路的斗争，是自己革自己的命。它必然会在每个人的思想深处展开了剧烈的震动和斗争。因此，这也是一项极其艰苦而复杂的任务。要完成这个任务，除了依靠组织的帮助以外，主要还要靠每一个人的自觉。过去几年中，我常常说，我们民主党派代表上层小资产阶级、资产阶级知识分子合理合法的利益，不是为了保存和维护这个阶级，而是为了改造和消灭这个阶级。现在我重温这些话，觉得更有现实意义。中国必须走社会主义的道路，这是六亿人民的最根本的利益，也是不以任何人的意志为转移的客观规律。在一九五六年以前，我们资产阶级知识分子的立足点是依附在资本主义的经济基础上的。这在当时历史条件下还是许可的。但是，在一九五六年社会主义改造高潮以后，什么资产阶级和资产阶级思想的资本主义的经济基础已经基本上被消灭了。“皮之不存、毛将焉附”。因此，只有下决心进行破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场的本质改造，把自己改造成为工人阶级的知识分子，才能适应这伟大的时代的发展和要求。这就是我们资产阶级知识分子唯一光明的出路。我们每一个人都应该满怀信心地向前看、向前走，任何停滞不前或者向后倒退都是没有出路的。
    怎样才算初步完成了立场改造呢？我认为最主要的标志应该是：全心全意接受党的领导，在实际行动中而不是仅仅在口头上积极拥护党的各项政策、方针和指示；一心一意走社会主义道路，确信社会主义制度的无比优越性。在任何情况下不怀疑、不动摇；在工作单位中努力搞好共事关系，特别是与党员同志在政治上团结一致；能自觉地加强学习，特别是加强对马克思列宁主义理论的学习；树立正确的劳动观点，培养与劳动人民同甘共苦的感情。所有这些，只要我们下决心去做，是可以做到的。
    目前客观形势和条件对我们进行本质改造是非常有利的。最基本的条件是伟大的党对我们的领导和关怀。同时，经过反右派斗争，我们都在不同程度上得到了锻炼和提高，明辨了大是大非，认识了社会主义制度的优越性和接受党的领导的重要性。这说明，反右派斗争的胜利，已使我们的本质改造有了起点。在这个基础上，我们来进行整风，改造政治立场，只要我们有自觉，我们就一定能够在社会主义的道路上向前迈进一大步。当然政治立场和思想的改造是需要经常不断地进行的，古语道：“流水不腐，户枢不蠹”正是这个道理。我们有了这次整风的经验和锻炼，今后每隔一定时间来一次整风，就更有条件。
    回顾一九五七年这一年，我国人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在各个战线上所获得的成就是辉煌的。经过声势浩大的反右派斗争和全民整风运动，使我们在政治战线上和思想战线上取得了伟大的胜利，这个胜利，转而又促进经济战线上的胜利，第一个五年计划的提前和超额完成，为我国社会主义工业化奠定了初步基础。党和政府提出了十年内农业发展纲要四十条，和在十五年或更多的时间内，在钢铁和重要工业产品产量方面赶上或者超过英国的奋斗目标，受到了全国人民的热烈拥护。目前，全国人民正以百倍的信心，和空前高涨的革命干劲，掀起工农业生产的新高潮，第二个五年计划的实施将进一步促进经济战线上新的跃进。在这样令人振奋的新形势面前，我们每一个人都以生活在这伟大的时代而感到自豪。同时，这对于我们每一个民主党派的成员也是一种鞭策。我们应该振作精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，紧紧地跟着社会主义的列车前进。
    我虽卧病日久，但是祖国在党的领导下一日千里的飞跃前进，却时刻照亮着我兴奋的心情。我对于民主党派的这次整风，更是时时不能忘怀，寄以无限的期望。我愿意同各民主党派的同志在一起，努力进行改造，把我们中国民主促进会的组织改造成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量，把我们自己改造成为工人阶级的知识分子，永远跟着共产党走，一心一意为社会主义服务，以完成我们光荣的历史任务。
