Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 19th: Twenty thousand people in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, broke with convention and celebrated the Spring Festival with labor.

On New Year's Eve, the foot of Mount Song in central China was ablaze with lights, as 200,000 people in Dengfeng County repaired reservoirs, managed sloping land, and eliminated the "Four Pests" through the night. All of the more than 400 reservoirs that had started construction before the Spring Festival not only did not stop work, but 49 new reservoirs also started construction that night. On countless wild mountain slopes in the fields, more than 100,000 farmers held up lanterns and torches, forming fiery dragons, and managed thousands of acres of sloping land overnight. In the sixth district of Dengfeng County, 55 out of 59 agricultural cooperatives had members repairing reservoirs overnight, with a total of more than 22,000 laborers participating, 3,000 more than the usual number of workers. They also newly managed 2,100 acres of sloping land on 21 mountain tops. Seventy-eight young people in the fifth district named the reservoir they started building on New Year's Eve "Youth Reservoir," and they dug 624 cubic meters of earth overnight. The Chengguan District originally planned to mobilize 1,200 people on New Year's Eve to manage Wanyang Slope, but more than 2,400 people participated, including demobilized soldiers who had only returned home for four days and workers who had returned from factories for vacation. They built 675 acres of field ridges and more than 1,000 field edges overnight, turning the original barren sand of Wanyang Slope into neat terraces. In addition to those who went to the countryside, all the cadres of the Dengfeng County Party Committee participated in labor and the elimination of the "Four Pests" during the Spring Festival.

The masses of Jingdian Township, the county's earliest "Four-No Township," had more than 1,000 people forming a large army to eliminate the "Four Pests," cleaning up garbage and filth from their homes.

    在劳动中欢度春节
    登丰二十万人连夜修水库、治坡地
    据新华社郑州19日电　河南省登封县的二十万人民打破常规，在劳动中欢度春节。
    除夕晚上，中岳嵩山的脚下一片灯光，登封县的二十万群众在这里连夜修水库、治坡地和除四害。全县在春节前开工的四百多个水库不仅没有一个停工，当晚还有四十九个水库新开工。在野外数不清的荒山坡上，十多万农民高举着灯笼火把，排成一条条火龙，一夜之间就治好了成千上万亩坡地。登封县第六区的五十九个农业社中，有五十五个社的社员连夜修水库，全区投入的劳动力有二万二千多人，比平常出工人数还多三千人，他们还在二十一个山头上新治坡地二千一百多亩。第五区的七十八个青年把他们在除夕夜开工修建的水库命名为“青春库”，他们一夜就挖了六百二十四个土方。城关区原来计划除夕出动一千两百人治理万阳坡，结果有两千四百多人参加，回家才四天的复员军人、从工厂回家休假的工人都来参加了劳动。他们在一夜之间就培好了六百七十五亩地埂和一千多道地边，把原来一片荒沙的万阳坡整理成一道道整整齐齐的坡地。中共登封县委机关的干部中除了下乡的外，其余干部春节期间也全部参加了劳动和除四害的活动。
    全县最先出现的“四无乡”——景店乡的群众，有一千多人组成一支除四害的大军，清除家中的垃圾和污秽。
