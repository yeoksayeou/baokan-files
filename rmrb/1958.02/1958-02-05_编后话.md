　　Editor's Notes
    The process of the Lianhua Cooperative mobilizing the masses to eliminate the four pests powerfully tells us that, if we want to mobilize the masses to do something well, we must first truly touch the hearts of the masses and transform propaganda into the conscious power of the masses. Then, the work will surely be successful. Therefore, health propaganda work must not be satisfied with being general; we must use our brains and create more propaganda methods. After realizing that ideological work had not been done well enough, the cadres of the Lianhua Cooperative thought of ways to use physical exhibitions, propaganda fields, and other lively and powerful propaganda methods to repeatedly educate the masses, finally arousing the masses' hatred for the four pests and consciously rising up to eliminate them.
    When the masses' understanding has been improved and their actions are positive, the movement should be kept regular. In this regard, the Lianhua Cooperative stipulated labor remuneration and regular evaluations. As a result, everyone's enthusiasm was high and they persisted. Other regions may also want to try it.

　　编后话
    莲花社发动群众除四害的过程，有力地告诉我们，要想发动群众做好一件事，必须首先真正打动了群众的心，使宣传化为群众的自觉力量，那么，工作是一定会胜利的。因此，卫生宣传工作决不能满足于一般化，一定要开动脑筋，多创造出一些宣传方法。莲花社的干部在认识到思想工作还没有做到家以后，就想办法，利用实物展览、宣传田等既生动又有力的宣传方法，来反复教育群众，终于激起了群众对四害的仇恨，自觉地起来除四害。
    群众的认识提高了，行动积极了，还应该保持运动经常化。在这方面，莲花社就规定了劳动报酬，定期评比。这样做果然大家情绪高涨，坚持下来。各地也不妨试一试看。
