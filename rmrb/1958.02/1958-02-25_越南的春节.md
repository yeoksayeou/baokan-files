    Like us, the Vietnamese people have been busy preparing for the Spring Festival since the 23rd day of the 12th month, when they send off the "Kitchen God" to heaven. At this time, the streets and markets of Hanoi are filled with colorful flowers, potted plants, New Year pictures, cakes, and other New Year goods. Old men with long beards wield large brushes on the side of the street, writing Spring Festival couplets and horizontal plaques in Chinese characters on vermilion paper. Children gather around the stalls selling New Year pictures. Housewives are busy preparing various traditional New Year dishes, such as fish stewed in meat, pickled onions, and sticky rice cakes (粽子). Wrapping sticky rice cakes is also a unique and interesting event. These cakes are made of glutinous rice and mung beans, are thick and square like bricks, and contain large pieces of pork. These cakes take a whole day and night to cook through, so on the night of cooking the cakes, the whole family sits around the stove and chats. The children are immersed in the fascinating stories told by the elders.
    In the countryside, every household plants a "New Year Bamboo" in front of their door. This is a bamboo stalk about five or six meters long, with only a few bamboo leaves left at the tip. Near the top of the stalk, a bamboo hoop is hung, and some small toys, such as porcelain fish and small bells, are hung on the hoop. When the breeze blows, these small toys emit beautiful and pleasant sounds. On the ground where the "New Year Bamboo" is planted, a large circle is drawn with white ash, symbolizing that everything will be as desired and that there will be a good harvest.
    The origin of planting the "New Year Bamboo" is said to be as follows: In ancient times, there was a demon who forced the people to grow rice for him. The demon said, "You can only eat the lower part of the crops, and I will eat the upper part." This threatened the people with starvation. Later, a Bodhisattva came and taught the people to grow sweet potatoes. So the demon, according to his promise, had to eat the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes. Later, the demon became angry and said, "In that case, I will eat everything, roots and leaves." The kind-hearted Bodhisattva then told the people to ask the demon for a piece of land the size of a palm, and said that wherever the shadow of the crops planted stretched, that land would belong to the people. The demon thought that such a small piece of land could not grow anything, so he agreed. The people planted bamboo overnight. Overnight, the bamboo grew tall and lush. The demon could not eat the roots and leaves of the bamboo. As soon as the sun came out, there were bamboo forests and bamboo shadows everywhere. In this way, the land would forever belong to the people and not to the demon.
    There is a Vietnamese folk saying: "It is not the New Year without fatty meat, pickled onions, red couplets, New Year bamboo, big sticky rice cakes, and the sound of firecrackers." Therefore, the sound of firecrackers can be heard everywhere on New Year's Eve. After twelve o'clock, people go to the temples. Those who do not believe in Buddhism also join in the fun, because on a misty New Year's night, there is a special charm in the temples filled with fragrant atmosphere. After visiting the temples, people carry home tender branches, which are "dew branches" symbolizing happiness and peace.
    On the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year, the children happily put on new clothes, and the parents warmly prepare to welcome the first guest who comes to pay a New Year's visit. Everyone hopes that this guest will be a person of high moral standing, so as to bring new happiness and peace to their family. Therefore, people often invite in advance the relative or friend they consider most satisfactory to be the first respected guest on the first day of the Lunar New Year.

### 越南的春节

    越南的春节
    越南人民同我们一样，从12月23日送“灶君”上天那天起，家家户户就忙着迎接春节了。这时，河内的街道上、市场上到处摆满了万紫千红的鲜花、盆景、年画、糕饼等年货。那些长胡子的老大爷们在街旁挥着大笔在朱红色的纸上用汉字书写春联和横匾。孩子们则团团围聚在卖年画的摊子旁边。家庭主妇们忙碌地准备各种具有传统性的年菜，像鱼燉肉、酸葱和粽子。包粽子还是一种别具风味的趣事呢，这种粽子是用糯米，绿豆做成的，厚方方的像块砖一样，里面夹着大块猪肉。这种粽子要花一昼夜的时间才能煮透，因此，在煮粽子的夜里，全家都围坐炉边谈心。孩子们则沉醉在老年人讲述的动听的故事里。
    在农村，家家户户门前都插起“迎春竹”，这是一株约五、六公尺长的修竹，仅在竹梢处留下一些竹叶子。近枝梢处挂着一个园竹圈，竹圈上还挂着一些小玩具，像瓷鱼和小铃等，微风吹来，这些小玩具就发出优美动听的声音。插“迎春竹”的地面上还用白灰画个大圆圈，象征一切美好如愿，五谷丰登的意思。
    相传插“迎春竹”的来历是这样的：古时有个魔鬼，强迫老百姓给他种稻。魔鬼说：“你们只能吃庄稼的下段，我吃上段”。这样老百姓就受到饥饿的威胁。后来，来了一位菩萨，他教老百姓种红薯。于是魔鬼依照诺言只好吃红薯的藤和叶子。后来魔鬼生气说：“既然这样，我就连根带叶一起都吃光”。这位好心菩萨又叫老百姓向魔鬼要一块手掌那么大的土地，而且说种下的庄稼影子伸到那儿，那儿的土地便是老百姓的。魔鬼认为那么小块土地能种出什么来呢？所以便答应了。老百姓们就连夜种上竹子了。一夜之间，竹子长大、茂盛起来了。竹子的根和叶魔鬼是吃不下的。太阳一出来，到处都是竹林和竹影。这样土地就永远属于老百姓而不是属于魔鬼的了。
    越南民间有一句俗语说：“没有肥肉、酸葱、红对联、迎春竹、大粽子和鞭炮声就不算是过年。”所以除夕之夜到处都响起鞭炮声。十二点钟以后，人们都逛庙去了。那些不信仰佛教的人也同样凑热闹去，因为在弥漫薄雾的新春之夜，在洋溢着芳郁气氛的庙里，别有一番风趣。逛完庙后，人们执着嫩树枝回家，这些是象征着幸福和平安的“露枝”。
    大年初一早晨，孩子们欢天喜地的穿上新装，家长们热情地准备迎接第一位来拜年的客人。谁都希望这位客人是位德高望重的人，好给他们家庭带来新的幸福和平安。因此，人们往往预先邀请好自己认为最满意的亲友来做大年初一的第一位令人尊敬的客人。
