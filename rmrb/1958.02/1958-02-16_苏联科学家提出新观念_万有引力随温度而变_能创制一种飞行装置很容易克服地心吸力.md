Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th dispatch from TASS: The well-known Soviet physicist, G. Stanyukovich, said that universal gravitation is not a fixed factor as previously thought; it can change with the state of elementary particles, especially with temperature. He believes that not only can huge multi-stage rockets overcome Earth's gravity, but creating flight devices unaffected by gravity is also a way to overcome it.

Stanyukovich recently presented this new concept at a meeting of the Interstellar Aviation Group of the Soviet Central Aviation Club. In his report on the physical nature of universal gravitation, he said that universal gravitation increases with rising temperature. For this reason, scientists have a new explanation for the nature of ultra-dense "white dwarfs." It is believed that the enormous density of these stars is caused by the enormous compression of matter. However, this does not exclude the following view: actually, one of the reasons for this phenomenon is that the unusual high temperature causes the enhancement of universal gravitation.

It can be assumed that reducing the temperature of matter to absolute zero will greatly weaken, or even eliminate, universal gravitation. According to preliminary calculations, even if only partially losing weight, a rocket needs only a speed of about 1,000 meters per second to overcome Earth's gravity, which is only one-twelfth of the normal situation. This means that fuel consumption can be reduced, and the efficiency of rocket engines can be increased by hundreds or even thousands of times.

Stanyukovich said that they have discovered new mathematical expressions for various laws of gravity. According to this scientist, the source of gravity is nuclear pulsation, which generates a special wave. The number of nuclear pulsations reaches one billion times one billion per second, and the speed of the wave generation process is close to the speed of light. In this case, matter gradually loses mass. The process of matter half-splitting will last for tens of billions of years. The scientist said that it can be predicted that not only atomic nuclei, but also electrons will have pulsations.

Stanyukovich said that it can now be said with certainty that baryons and other special particles carrying gravity do not exist. It can only be assumed that nuclear radiation quanta are called baryons.

### 苏联科学家提出新观念  万有引力随温度而变  能创制一种飞行装置很容易克服地心吸力

    苏联科学家提出新观念
    万有引力随温度而变
    能创制一种飞行装置很容易克服地心吸力
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联著名物理学家基·斯塔纽科维奇说，万有引力并不像以前所认为的那样是固定不变的因素，它能够随着基本粒子的状况、特别是会随着温度而变化。他认为不仅巨大的多级火箭能克服地心引力，创造不受引力影响的飞行装置，也是克服地心引力的一条途径。
    斯塔纽科维奇最近在苏联中央航空俱乐部星际航空组的会议上提出了这种新观念。他在作关于万有引力物理性质的报告时说，万有引力会随着温度的上升而增强。由于这个缘故，科学家对于超密集“白矮星”的性质有一种新的解释。认为这些星的巨大密度是因为物质的巨大压缩所引起的。但是这并不排除下面一种看法：实际上产生这种现象的原因之一是不寻常的高温引起了万有引力的增强。
    可以假定说，把物质的温度降低到绝对零度将使万有引力大大减弱，甚至于消失。根据初步计算，即使达到部分地失去重量，火箭只要相当于每秒一千公尺左右的速度就能战胜地心吸力，即只为正常情况下的十二分之一。这就意味着可以减少燃料的消耗，把火箭发动机的效率提高几百甚至几千倍。
    斯塔纽科维奇说，他们发现了各种引力定律新的数学表达式。据这位科学家说，引力的来源是核的脉动，这种脉动产生一种特殊的波。核脉动的次数每秒钟达到十亿乘十亿次，而产生波的过程的速度接近于光速。在这种情况下，物质逐渐失去质量。物质半分裂的过程要延续数百亿年。这位科学家说，可以预料，不仅原子核，而且还有电子都会有脉动。
    斯塔纽科维奇说，现在可以有把握地说，重子以及携带重力的其他一些特别的粒子是不存在的。仅仅可以假定地把核辐射量子叫做重子。
