    Six Hundred Million People are Leaping Forward!
    ——Notes from Attending the Fifth Session of the National People's Congress
    By Our Correspondent Yi Qin
      "The thought of the Great Leap Forward is so deeply rooted in people's hearts! A nationwide high tide of revolutionary competition in socialist construction has already formed." This is the clear and prominent impression that this National People's Congress brings to people.
    More than 1,200 representatives representing the 600 million people of the country, despite their different positions and experiences, all expressed a common voice: "Six hundred million people are leaping forward!"
    Shao Xianghua, chief engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel, announced the grand plan for the Great Leap Forward by Anshan workers; agricultural labor model Li Yaoxian reported on the situation of realizing the Agricultural Development Program in the cold and barren mountainous areas; Zhang Xinghua, industrial labor model of Zhejiang Province, expressed the ambition of the people of Hangzhou to eliminate the "Four Pests" within two years; Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, called on cultural workers across the country to also have a Great Leap Forward in 1958; He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, called on returned overseas Chinese and their families to also muster their energy and strive for the top; even Huang Yanpei, an 80-year-old representative, took to the stage to challenge, saying that he was "much younger" and wanted to "compete in enthusiasm" with everyone.
    The six hundred million Chinese people, leaping forward with majestic strides, millions of workers are full of enthusiasm and energy. Everywhere there is a production competition upsurge of "finding advanced, learning from advanced, comparing with advanced, and catching up with advanced," and the production targets are "adding codes layer by layer, improving step by step, revising and revising, breaking through and breaking through." In Anshan, the famous steel capital, the output of steel in 1957 has already exceeded three times the highest output during the Japanese occupation. Their plan for 1958 is even grander: the output of pig iron will increase by 545,000 tons compared with 1957, an increase of 16.1%; the output of steel will increase by 25.4%; and the output of steel products will increase by 16.9%. How can this amazing speed of industrial production not be encouraging? We know that in the United Kingdom, from 1941 to 1956, the growth rate of steel was only 3.5% per year on average in fifteen years. Compared with our Anshan, they are simply crawling. Although Anshan is only an individual factory and mine, and the national situation varies, we can get a glimpse of the whole picture from these individual factories and mines. Their achievements have greatly boosted the confidence of the people across the country, and the goal of surpassing the United Kingdom in fifteen years is definitely achievable.
    Huang Rongchang, an industrial labor model in Chongqing, said: Since the Party Central Committee put forward the call to catch up with the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years, the more than 10,000 employees of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have become more and more energetic, and more and more new records have been made. In 1957, the output of steel reached more than 250,000 tons. The representatives of Chongqing all know how much this number weighs. At the beginning of liberation, this company could only produce a few hundred tons of steel. Calculated at the production speed before liberation, it would take 260 years to reach the current level, but we only used a short eight years.
    On the agricultural production front, hundreds of millions of farmers, with the posture of historical giants, in just a few months, with majestic steps, crossed the mileage of decades, hundreds of years, or even thousands of years of the old society. Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Resources, said: In the four months from last winter to the end of January this year, we have opened up more than 117 million mu of irrigated area. This was simply unimaginable in old China! Before liberation, our ancestors opened up a total of 230 million mu of irrigated area in the long four thousand years. That is to say, what we did in four months is equal to half of what we did in four thousand years before liberation.
    In fact, the miracle is more than this. The miracle also lies in the fact that things that our ancestors never dared to think about have become a vivid reality here. Zhao Shoushan, Governor of Shaanxi Province, told us: The masses in Caojia Township, Qishan County, Shaanxi Province, cut mountains and split rocks, dug canals, and diverted river water to the "Wuzhangyuan" which is forty feet high, irrigating more than 5,000 mu of land. The masses said proudly: "Zhuge Liang wanted to divert water to the plain to solve the problem of drinking water for the soldiers, but he failed to do so. Now, we have done it."
    The Gaoyangzi Township United Agricultural Cooperative in Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province, is a place where "there are many mountains, and no mountain is not bare; there are many rivers, and no river is not dry." Before liberation, one mu of land could only produce dozens of kilograms of grain. After liberation, from 1954 to 1957, it only increased from an average of 180 kilograms per mu to 215 kilograms. Many people think that it has reached the top. However, Li Yaoxian, an agricultural labor model from this cooperative, used convincing facts to show that it is also possible to leap forward in such a barren mountainous area. The cooperative's Chinese Communist Party organization led the farmers to work hard to trial-plant millet on 110 mu of sloping land, and actually harvested an average of 780 kilograms per mu. This increased production fact became a raging fire in the entire cooperative, severely burning down conservative and crawling thoughts. The enthusiasm of the cooperative members was high, and they insisted that all the more than 15,000 mu of land in the cooperative should produce grain like this 110 mu of land.
    In the remote border areas of the motherland, many sparsely populated, cold, and remote places are now also boiling and singing. Bayanhu, the county head from Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of the motherland, said: Zhaoyuan County, a place known as the "Great Northern Wilderness," had a rare heavy snowfall of more than three feet deep last winter, and the temperature was as low as minus thirty degrees Celsius. However, the masses said: "Production leap forward warms people's hearts, not afraid of wind and snow piercing the bones," "The winter in the Great Northern Wilderness has turned into spring," "Mountains and rivers can be changed, and the leap forward is not difficult. We must jump hard, jump resolutely, jump to the north of the Yellow River this year, jump to the south of the Yellow River in three years, and cross the Yangtze River within ten years." What a heroic revolutionary spirit!
    Representatives from minority areas in the border regions also put forward the heroic slogan of "striving to cross several centuries within a few years." People still remember vividly that in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, 860,000 Yi farmers lived a miserable life of slavery at the beginning of liberation. However, at the group discussion of this National People's Congress, Zhang Rong, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture Committee, said: 27% of the farmers in the prefecture have joined the advanced agricultural cooperatives. Yi farmers, who have never known how to fertilize in history, applied thousands of kilograms of manure per mu last year. Last year, the grain output per mu in the Greater and Lesser Liangshan Mountains has increased from dozens of kilograms before liberation to more than 130 kilograms. This autonomous prefecture will basically achieve collectivization within three years, and the grain output per mu will reach 400 kilograms within ten years.
    Leaping forward in production requires technology, technology requires culture, and healthy bodies. Therefore, while production and construction are leaping forward, cultural, educational, and health undertakings are also leaping forward at an unprecedented speed. Thousands of laboring people use the enthusiasm for production to learn culture, run schools, and eliminate the four pests. Representatives on the cultural and educational front have a very deep understanding of this. Tian Junliang, Director of the Education Department of Guizhou Province, said: Guizhou was a poor and backward place before liberation. The laboring people could not afford to study. They had tasted the pain of being "illiterate." After liberation, the enthusiasm for running schools was like a long river flowing, moving forward bravely, and no difficulty could stop them. If there is no money to build school buildings, everyone will donate wood, bark, and work themselves to build school buildings; if there is no money to add equipment, student parents will use waste wood to make desks and blackboards. In this way, the number of private primary schools in Guizhou Province has developed to more than 6,000 in the past five years, especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1957.
    Li Dequan, Minister of Health, said: The patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests has been carried out on a larger scale and vigorously throughout the country. In the past two months, from cities to rural areas, from plains to mountainous areas, from coastal areas to border areas, a unprecedentedly large-scale upsurge has been set off. More than 40 million rats have been eliminated nationwide, 25 million sparrows have been caught, and a large number of overwintering mosquitoes and flies have been eliminated. More than 4,600 cities, counties, districts, townships, towns, communities, streets, enterprises, schools, and institutions that have achieved zero to four nos have emerged. This is of course another miracle. Today, some places that are praised as "four nos" were originally places where flies and mosquitoes were flying around and rats were running around!
    Workers and peasants have launched a Great Leap Forward in production. Intellectuals, business circles, and members of democratic parties must be able to serve the Great Leap Forward in production. The primary task is to transform their thinking. This is the common voice of many representatives. Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, asked cultural workers across the country to have a Great Leap Forward on the cultural front in 1958. He said: After the impact of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front last year, the vast majority of cultural workers deeply felt the necessity of thorough transformation. They are determined to unconditionally and permanently integrate with the workers and peasants. A nationwide cultural movement facing the workers and peasants, going deep into the workers and peasants, and serving the workers and peasants wholeheartedly is gradually taking shape.
    Liu Jingji, a representative from Shanghai and General Manager of Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture Anda Textile Factory, said: The business community must also catch up. Our catching up means to work hard to accelerate self-transformation, correct our position, and contribute all our knowledge and skills to the country. If some people in the business community competed for reputation and status in the past, they must compete for contributing strength in the future.
    Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, when talking about how the democratic parties can serve the Great Leap Forward in production, asked the members of the democratic parties, including himself, to "hand over their hearts nakedly through rectification" and be a "pure person, an honest person, and a frank person."
    These voices, this mood, are common. If a person lives among the masses, instead of living in the small circle that pursues personal interests all day long, if what he cares about is the interests of the people, instead of personal gains and losses, then in such a great torrent, how can he not feel that he must "speed up and catch up"?
    The six hundred million Chinese people, with revolutionary vigor, have formed an eastern giant dragon, creating a history that is more magnificent and more amazing than each page. Chairman Mao said: "Our goal must be achieved, and our goal can certainly be achieved." Past facts have fully proved the correctness of these two sentences, and future facts will continue to prove the correctness of these two sentences.

    六亿人民在跃进！
    ——全国人民代表大会第五次会议旁听记
    本报记者　宜勤
      “大跃进的思想是那么深入人心！一个全民性的社会主义建设的革命大竞赛的高潮已经形成。”这是这次全国人民代表大会带给人们的鲜明而突出的印象。
    代表全国六亿人民的一千二百多位代表，尽管他们的岗位不同，经历不同，但是，所有的发言，都洋溢着一个共同的声音：“六亿人民在跃进”！
    鞍钢总工程师邵象华宣布了鞍山工人大跃进的宏伟计划，农业劳动模范李耀先报告了在高寒贫瘠山区实现农业发展纲要的情况，浙江省工业劳动模范张杏花表示了杭州市人民决心在两年内消灭“四害”的雄心，文化部副部长钱俊瑞号召全国文化工作者在1958年也来一个大跃进，华侨事务委员会主任何香凝号召归侨、侨眷也要鼓起干劲，力争上游，甚至八十高龄的代表黄炎培也登台挑战，说自己“年轻了许多”，要和大家“比一比干劲”。
    以雄伟的步伐向前跃进的六亿中国人民，千万职工个个情绪高涨，劲头十足，到处出现了“找先进、学先进、比先进、赶先进”的生产竞赛高潮，生产指标是“层层加码、步步提高，修改又修改、突破又突破”。著名的钢都鞍山，1957年钢的产量已经超过日本统治时期最高产量的三倍。1958年他们的计划更雄伟：生铁产量比1957年增产五十四万五千吨，即增长16.1％，钢的产量增长25.4％，钢材产量增长16.9％。这种工业生产上的惊人的速度怎能不令人欢欣鼓舞？我们知道，在英国，从1941年到1956年的十五年内，钢的增长速度每年平均才3.5％，这种速度，同我们的鞍山相比，他们简直像在爬行一样。虽然，鞍山只是个别厂矿，而全国的情况，则有高有低。但是从这些个别的厂矿，也可以窥见一斑。他们的成就，大大鼓舞了全国人民的信心，十五年超过英国这个目标是一定能达到的。
    重庆市工业劳动模范黄荣昌说：自从党中央提出在十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国的号召以后，重庆钢铁公司一万多职工，劲头越来越大，新纪录越来越多，1957年钢的产量达到了二十五万多吨。重庆的代表都知道这个数字该有多重的分量，初解放时，这个公司只能生产几百吨钢，以解放前的生产速度计算，需要走二百六十年的路程，才能达到现在这样的水平，而我们却只用了短短的八年。
    在农业生产战线上，亿万农民以历史巨人的姿态，在短短的几个月内，用雄伟的步伐，跨过旧社会几十年、几百年，甚至几千年的里程。水利部部长傅作义说：从去年冬天到今年1月底的四个月里，我们开辟了一亿一千七百多万亩灌溉面积。这在旧中国简直是不能想像的呀！解放前，我们的祖先在漫长的四千年里，一共才开辟了两亿三千万亩的灌溉面积。这就是说：我们四个月做的事情等于解放前四千年做的事情的一半。
    其实，奇迹还不止此，奇迹还在于我们的祖祖辈辈连想也不敢想的事情，在这里成了活生生的现实。陕西省省长赵寿山告诉我们：陕西省岐山县曹家乡的群众，削山劈石，开挖渠道，把河水引上了四十丈高的“五丈原”，浇地五千多亩。群众自豪地说：“诸葛亮当年想引水上原，解决士兵吃水问题，但没有办到，现在，咱们办到了”。
    辽宁省凌源县高杖子乡联合农业合作社是个“山多，无山不秃，河多，无河不干”的地方，解放以前，一亩地才打几十斤粮食，解放以后，从1954年到1957年，也只由平均每亩一百八十斤提高到二百一十五斤。很多人认为已经到顶了。可是，来自这个社的农业劳动模范李耀先却用具有无比说服力的事实，说明在这样的贫瘠山区也可以跃进。社的中共党组织领导农民在一百一十亩二坡地上下功夫试种谷子，居然平均每亩地收了七百八十斤。这个增产事实在全社变成了一把烈火，狠狠烧掉了保守爬行思想，社员的干劲高涨，非叫全社一万五千余亩土地都像这一百一十亩地给出粮不可。
    在祖国遥远的边疆，许多人烟稀少，酷寒、偏僻的地方，现在，也在沸腾，也在歌唱。来自祖国最北方——黑龙江肇源县县长巴彦胡说：肇源县，这个号称“北大荒”的地方，去年冬天降了几十年来少有的三尺多深的大雪，温度低到零下三十多度，可是，群众说：“生产跃进人心暖，不怕风雪刺骨寒”，“北大荒的冬天变成了春天”，“山河都可改，跃进也不难，要狠狠的跳，坚决的跳，今年跳到黄河北，三年跳到黄河南，十年之内过长江”。这是何等豪迈的革命英雄气概！
    边疆少数民族地区的代表也提出了“努力争取在几年以内跨过几个世纪”的英雄口号。人们都还记忆犹新，在凉山彝族自治州，八十六万彝族农民在解放之初，还过着奴隶社会的悲惨的生活。可是，在这次全国人民代表大会小组讨论会上，中共凉山彝族自治州委员会书记张荣代表说：全州已有27％的农户，参加了高级农业合作社，有史以来从不知道施肥的彝族农民，去年在每亩地里施了上千斤的粪肥，去年大小凉山里的每亩粮食产量，已经由解放前的几十斤增加到一百三十多斤。这个自治州将在三年内达到基本上合作化，十年内要使粮食产量每亩达到四百斤。
    在生产上跃进就要技术，要技术就要文化，要健康的身体，因此，在生产建设大跃进的同时，文化教育卫生事业也以空前未有的速度向前跃进。千千万万劳动人民用搞生产的热情，学文化，办学校，除四害，文教战线上的代表对于这一点体会得非常深刻。贵州省教育厅厅长田君亮就说到：贵州解放以前是个又穷又白的地方，劳动人民读不起书，他们尝够了“睁眼瞎”的痛苦，解放以后，办学的积极性有如长河流注，勇往直前，任何困难都不能阻止他们。没有钱盖校舍，大家就捐献木料，树皮，自己出工来盖校舍；没有钱添置设备，学生家长就利用废旧木料做课桌、黑板。就这样，贵州省的民办小学五年来，特别经过1957年大跃进以后，现在已发展到了六千多所。
    卫生部部长李德全说：以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动已经在全国各地更大规模地轰轰烈烈地开展起来，两个月来，从城市到农村，从平原到山区，从沿海到边疆，已经掀起声势浩大规模空前的高潮。全国已消灭了老鼠四千万只以上，捕雀二千五百万只，消灭大量越冬蚊蝇，涌现出一无到四无的市、县、区、乡、镇、社、街道、企业、学校和机关已有四千六百个以上。这当然又是一个奇迹，今天有些被誉为“四无”的地方，在解放前原是苍蝇、蚊子乱飞，老鼠成群结队的呀！
    工农劳动人民掀起了生产大跃进，知识分子、工商界、民主党派成员要能为生产大跃进服务，头等任务就是要改造思想，这是许多代表发出的共同的声音。文化部副部长钱俊瑞要求全国文化工作者在1958年来一个文化战线上的大跃进。他说：经过去年政治思想战线上社会主义革命的冲击，绝大部分文化工作者痛感彻底改造的必要，他们决心无条件地、长期地和工农群众相结合。一个全国规模的面向工农、深入工农、全心全意为工农服务的文化运动已经在逐渐形成。
    上海市代表、上海公私合营安达纺织厂总经理刘靖基说：工商界也要赶上去，我们的赶上去就是要努力加速自我改造，端正自己的立场，把一切知识、技能贡献给国家，如果工商界过去有些人在名誉地位上竞赛的话，今后就要在贡献力量方面竞赛。
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席程潜在谈到各民主党派如何为生产大跃进服务时，要求民主党派成员，包括他自己在内，要“通过整风，把心赤裸裸地交出来”，做一个“纯洁的人，老实的人，坦白的人。”
    这些声音，这种心情，都是共同的，一个人如果生活在群众当中，而不是生活在那整日追求个人利益的小圈子里，如果他所关心的是人民大众的利益，而不是个人的得失，那么，在这样一个伟大的洪流里，他怎么能不感到自己要“加快步伐赶上去”呢？
    鼓起了革命干劲的六亿中国人民已经组成了一条东方巨龙，正在创造一页比一页更加雄壮、更加惊人的历史。毛主席说过：“我们的目的一定要达到，我们的目的一定能够达到”。过去的事实已经充分证明这两句话的正确，今后的事实还会继续证明这两句话的正确。
