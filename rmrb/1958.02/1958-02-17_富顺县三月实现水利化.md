Fushun County to Realize Water Conservancy in March

(Reported by this newspaper) Fushun County, Sichuan Province, after three months of hard work, has realized full irrigation of both paddy and dry land. By mid-February, more than 7,200 water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring have been basically completed, capable of irrigating more than 490,000 mu of farmland, exceeding the plan by 220%, equivalent to more than three times the irrigated area before liberation. Coupled with the original water conservancy facilities, all the county's paddy and dry land can grow double-cropping rice.

In the construction of water conservancy projects, the policy of relying on the masses and managing water conservancy diligently and thriftily has been fully implemented. The county has built twice as many water conservancy projects as in 1955, but the national loans only account for one-twentieth of those in 1955.

    富顺县三月实现水利化
    本报讯　四川省富顺县经过三个月的苦战，实现了水田旱田全部水利化。到2月中旬止，去冬今春兴修的七千二百多处水利工程已基本完成，可灌溉田地四十九万多亩，超过计划220％，相当于解放前灌溉面积三倍以上，加上原有水利设施，使全县所有水旱田都能种双季稻。
    在兴修水利中，全部贯彻了依靠群众、勤俭治水的方针，全县兴修水利工程比1955年多一倍，但国家贷款只占1955年的二十分之一。
