Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th dispatch: As the economic recession in the United States continues to develop, even US President Eisenhower, who deliberately expressed "confidence" in the economic outlook, has now lowered his tone. At Eisenhower's press conference on the 4th, a "Washington Post" reporter asked him "what is the basis" for "expecting business activity to pick up later this year." Eisenhower said: "Now, I am very careful... I don't want to be overly optimistic." He evasively admitted that this year "January, February, and March will probably continue to decline."

Currently, the Joint Economic Committee of both houses of the US Congress is holding hearings on Eisenhower's proposed "Economic Report." At the meeting, many economists also disagreed that the recession was only a temporary phenomenon, believing that the economic situation was far more serious than officially acknowledged.

Some Democratic congressmen on the 7th accused the Eisenhower administration of the serious trend in the US economy. Michigan Senator Patrick McNamara said the United States was facing "serious economic difficulties." He criticized Eisenhower's economic policies. Another senator, Joseph Clark (Pennsylvania), blamed Eisenhower for failing to lead the states to take action. He said: "While the serious difficulties of unemployment are growing, he is quietly standing aside, letting the situation continue to drift."

On the 6th, thirty-five Democratic and Republican congressmen handed a jointly signed petition to Eisenhower. In the petition, they represented forty-five US industrial areas in "serious difficulty" and requested Eisenhower to establish an "effective plan" to alleviate the unemployment problem in these areas. There is a "large surplus of labor" in these areas.

In addition, Tennessee Democratic Senator Albert Gore asked Congress to establish a $500 million public works program to "cope with the depression."

Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: The report released by the three major US auto companies on February 3 stated that the output of cars and trucks produced by these three major companies in January this year decreased by 12% to more than 50% compared to January last year. "General" Motors decreased by 12%, "Ford" decreased by more than 25%, and "Chrysler" decreased by more than 50%. These three major auto companies monopolize 97% of the country's automobile production. The report said that the main reason for the sharp decline in production was the difficulty in selling cars.

US steel production is currently at a very low level. The steel operating rate is only 56%. The "Iron Age" magazine published on the 6th said that the steel production situation in February this year is estimated to be even worse.

US cotton is experiencing a sales crisis. According to the US Department of Agriculture on the 6th, in the 1957-58 sales year (from August 1957 to July 1958), US cotton sales will decrease by 2.7 million bales.

In foreign markets, US cotton sales will decrease by 2.1 million bales. US domestic cotton sales are estimated to decrease by 600,000 bales. The Department of Agriculture said that in the first five months of this sales year, the amount of cotton consumed by domestic textile mills in the United States fell to the lowest level since 1939 due to excessive inventory.

According to figures released by the US Department of Labor on the 6th, the number of people in the United States receiving unemployment benefits reached 2,779,000 in the week ending February 4. This number is 400,000 higher than the previous highest number in the United States - the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in January 1950. Labor Department officials said that in addition, more than one million unemployed workers are currently in a state of complete helplessness because they are unable to enjoy unemployment benefits or have used up their share of benefits.

According to the material in the January 24 issue of "U.S. News & World Report," US personal income in December last year decreased by $2.6 billion at an annual rate compared to the previous month. US personal income has been declining for four consecutive months. The reduction in workers' wage income is one reason for the decline in personal income.

　　事实胜于诡辩　高腔变成低调
    美总统承认国内经济仍将衰退
    三大汽车公司严重减产　钢铁开工率只有56％
    新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国经济衰退继续发展的情况下，甚至故意表示对经济前景“抱有信心”的美国总统艾森豪威尔现在也把调子放低了。在艾森豪威尔4日举行的记者招待会上，“华盛顿邮报”记者问他“预料企业活动在今年晚些时候会回升”的“根据何在”，艾森豪威尔说：“现在，我非常慎重……不希望过份乐观”。他躲躲闪闪地承认今年“1月、2月和3月大概还将继续衰退”。
    目前美国国会两院联席经济委员会正就艾森豪威尔提出的“经济报告”举行意见听取会，在会上，许多经济学家也不同意说衰退只是暂时的现象，他们认为经济情况远比官方所承认的要严重。
    一些民主党议员7日就美国经济的严重趋势指责艾森豪威尔政府。密执安州参议员帕特里克·麦克纳马拉说，美国正面临着“严重的经济困难”。他批评了艾森豪威尔的经济政策。另一个参议员约瑟夫·克拉克（宾夕法尼亚州）责备艾森豪威尔没有领导各州来采取行动。他说：“当失业的严重困难正在增长的时候，他却静悄悄地站在一边，让局势继续自流下去。”
    6日，三十五名民主党和共和党众议员把一份联合签名的请求书交给艾森豪威尔，他们在请求书中代表美国四十五个处于“严重困难中的”工业区要求艾森豪威尔设立一项“有效的计划”来减轻这些地区的失业问题。在这些地区有着“大量的剩余劳动力”。
    另外田纳西州民主党参议员艾尔伯特·戈尔要求国会设立一项五亿美元的公共工程计划来“对付萧条”。
    据新华社8日讯　美国三大汽车公司2月3日发表的报告说，这三个大公司今年1月份出产的汽车和卡车比去年1月份的产量分别减少了12％到50％以上。“通用”汽车公司减少了12％，“福特”减少了25％以上，“克莱斯勒”减少了50％以上。这三大汽车公司垄断了美国全国97％的汽车生产。报告说，生产剧减的主要原因是汽车销路困难。
    美国钢铁生产目前停留在很低的水平上。钢铁的开工率只有56％。6日出版的“钢铁时代”杂志说，估计今年2月份的钢铁生产的情况还要坏。
    美国棉花发生销路危机。据美国农业部6日说，在1957—58销售年（从1957年8月到1958年7月），美国棉花的销路要减少二百七十万包。
    在国外市场上，美国棉花的销路要减少二百一十万包。美国国内的棉花销路估计要减少六十万包。农业部说，在这个销售年的头五个月，美国国内纺织厂里所消费掉的棉花数量下降到1939年来的最低水平，原因是存货过多。
    据美国劳工部6日发表的数字，到2月4日为止的一周，美国领取失业救济金的人数达到二百七十七万九千人。这个数字比美国过去的最高数字——1950年1月的领取失业救济金的人数还高出四十万人。劳工部官员说，此外还有一百万以上的失业工人由于享受不到失业救济金或者已经用完了他们的一份救济金，在目前处于完全的无援状态。
    1月24日一期“美国新闻与世界报道”的材料，去年12月美国个人收入以年率计算比上一月下降了二十六亿美元。美国的个人收入已经连续四个月出现下降。工人工资收入的减少是个人收入下降的一个原因。
