In Newspapers Across the Country

	Spring Arrives in the Land of Abundance

	The front page of the Sichuan Daily on the 5th used several snapshots of farmers' spring plowing activities on "Beginning of Spring" as a special column, with poems, pictures, and three short communications. "Spring Arrives in Thousand-Jin County" reported on the busy spring plowing activities of more than 200,000 farmers in Pi County. "Racing Ahead of Time" reported on the intense activity of Shunjiang Cooperative in Neijiang County in sending manure to topdress wheat. "A Busy Day" reported on the members of the Gonghe Cooperative in Fushun County supporting other cooperatives in working overtime to rush the construction of water conservancy projects, and the members who stayed at home actively engaging in spring plowing activities such as preparing rice paddies and selecting seeds. Fu Chou's short poem "Spring Comes Early This Year" described the arrival of spring plowing. The entire page was filled with an atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward.

	Wake Up the "Sleeping Plow"!

	The Guangxi Daily on the 5th, on the front page, reported the upsurge of using double-wheeled, double-furrow plows in Yishan County, and included a short commentary called "Wake Up the 'Sleeping Plow'." The news said that the double-furrow plow, which had been forgotten under the shackles of conservative thinking, is now particularly popular. In the spring of 1957, under a gust of evil wind, 2,000 of the 4,000 double-furrow plows that had been promoted in the region were returned. Recently, after criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking and holding agricultural tool training classes, an upsurge of eliminating "sleeping plows" has been launched throughout the region. Damao Mountain guarantees that all of the more than 100 plows that have been promoted will be used this year. In the hilly areas of Yishan County, 120 "sleeping plows" that had been shelved for three years have all been put into production.

	Henan Fish-Scale Pits Arrive in Zhejiang

	The Zhejiang Daily on the 7th, on the second page, introduced the experience of Henan Province in digging fish-scale pits and managing slopes and gullies in mountainous areas with a large banner photograph and a special article. The article and photographs were specially requested by the Zhejiang Daily from the Henan Daily, and an editor's note was added, saying that digging fish-scale pits and building horizontal ditches in mountainous areas was originally the experience of Daquanshan in Shanxi. Now this experience has blossomed and borne fruit in Henan. Zhejiang's water conservancy construction is advancing towards a new high tide. According to tests in Shangyu, Zhuji, and other places, digging fish-scale pits is indeed a good way to store water and conserve soil, and it is completely suitable for the specific conditions of Zhejiang Province. It is hoped that this experience can also blossom and bear fruit in Zhejiang.

	Joyfully Welcome Spring in the Sound of the Great Leap Forward

	The Xinhua Daily and the Zhejiang Daily on the 6th prominently reported on the Spring Festival propaganda issue on the front page. The Xinhua Daily reported on the preparations for Spring Festival propaganda in various parts of Jiangsu and published a commentator's article titled "Propaganda Work for the Great Leap Forward in Production," explaining that the Spring Festival propaganda campaign that will soon appear throughout the province will concentrate on publicizing the situation, commending advanced individuals, inspiring enthusiasm, and promoting production.

	The Zhejiang Daily published on the front page the instructions of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on carrying out extensive propaganda on the situation and tasks, requiring a wide range of propaganda to be carried out during the Spring Festival. It also published an editorial entitled "Joyfully Welcome Spring in the Sound of the Great Leap Forward," commenting on the Spring Festival propaganda issue.

	Old Cadres Attack Scientific Fortresses

	The Liberation Daily's front-page news on the 6th reported that many old cadres and worker-peasant cadres with practical struggle experience in Shanghai are marching towards science and culture. Party committees of many universities, such as Jiaotong University, Tongji University, and East China University of Political Science and Law, have formulated training plans, and old cadres and worker-peasant cadres have also formulated personal plans, determined to study technology with strong will and unremitting efforts, and strive to become red experts. Huang Zonglin, director of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, completed algebra, geometry, textile engineering, "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" in one year last year, learned Esperanto and flat car operation of cloth machines, and has now formulated a personal study plan for the second five-year plan period.

	No Corruption of Employees Allowed

	The Shanghai News Daily's front-page news on the 6th raised an important issue: Small factories and shops urgently need to strengthen leadership. At the same time, it also published an editorial entitled "No Corruption of Employees Allowed." Shanghai recently discovered that Wang Honggao, the private factory director of Wang Yongshun Machinery Branch Factory, colluded with accountant Chen Zhongliang to use the economic thinking of employees to win them over and corrupt them, steal enterprise assets, and set up underground factories. It also reported that the Dahe Old Photography Equipment Store, because the government did not send a public representative, private personnel bribed employees and stole more than 12,000 yuan of state assets. The editorial pointed out that these small factories and shops without public representatives urgently need to strengthen leadership.

	Welcoming the Great Agricultural Inspection

	The Hubei Provincial Party Committee decided to conduct several province-wide agricultural production inspections every year. The Hubei Daily on the 7th, on the second page, reported the specific measures taken by the Tianmen County Committee of the Communist Party of China to prepare for the great inspection. It was decided to focus on several major tasks such as summer harvest crop cultivation, spring plowing preparation, and cooperative operation and management, and to carry out a large-scale inspection throughout the county. Each district also held emergency meetings. This activity to welcome the great inspection will promote production to a new climax.

	Don't Believe in Evil, Accumulate More Fertilizer!

	The Yunnan Daily on January 31st used the entire first and second pages to report on the movement of people of all ethnic groups in the province to build toilets and sheds and increase the accumulation of human and animal manure with revolutionary spirit. At the same time, it published an editorial titled "Don't Believe in Evil!" and added a large heading "Breaking Superstition is a Matter of Human Effort," excerpting Chairman Mao's quotations on breaking superstition.

	The front-page headline news highlighted the movement in Yuanjiang County to break the old habits of "eating at home and defecating in the wild" and "releasing wild cattle and wild boars" and increase the accumulation of fertilizer. The Dai, Hani, Bai, and other ethnic groups here have never had the habit of applying fertilizer since ancient times. Based on this situation, the county party committee specially organized a large-scale debate on fertilizer accumulation to educate the masses to break superstition and solve specific problems in fertilizer accumulation. Now 80% of the households in the county have toilets and livestock sheds. The second page also reported on the situation of people of all ethnic groups in Jianshui County changing customs and accumulating human and animal manure. This county wants to eliminate households without toilets and cow sheds in the short term.

	A Good Initiative

	The Heilongjiang Daily on the 7th published on the first page several initiatives proposed by 56 industrial and mining enterprises to all industrial and mining enterprises in the province at the industrial production collaboration meeting, and published an editorial entitled "A Good Initiative." The main content of the initiative is that industrial and mining enterprises should vigorously support agriculture, and factories should establish long-term mutual support contracts with agricultural cooperatives. The editorial pointed out that this is a glorious political task for the working class of industrial enterprises throughout the province, and proposed to mobilize employees to go to the countryside during the Spring Festival to carry out worker-peasant get-togethers and understand the needs of agricultural cooperatives.
