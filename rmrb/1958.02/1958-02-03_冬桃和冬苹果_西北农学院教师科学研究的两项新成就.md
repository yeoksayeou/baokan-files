Winter Peach and Winter Apple
—Two New Scientific Achievements of Teachers at Northwest Agricultural College
Ye Nong

　　Winter is a season when nature's colors are relatively dim. How wonderful it would be if people could eat plump, fresh peaches or red, shiny apples freshly picked from the tree at this time!

　　One Sunday after the winter solstice, I and a dozen agricultural scientists from the Wugong area came to the experimental farm of Northwest Agricultural College.

　　As soon as we entered the house, we smelled a strong fragrance. It turned out that fresh apples and fresh peaches were all over the table.

　　The host first cut many apples into slices and handed them to us. A new variety among them aroused everyone's common interest: the fruit shape is very similar to "Guoguang", but it is redder and larger than "Guoguang" (each averaging more than four taels in weight), the color is particularly beautiful, it tastes particularly crisp, the moisture is just right, and the taste is very sweet. What kind of variety is this? Several experts had never seen it before. It turns out that this is the "Winter Apple" cultivated by Yan Naiyou, associate professor of the Department of Horticulture at Northwest Agricultural College, according to Michurin's principle of "directed cultivation."

　　Yan Naiyou introduced that the mother plant of this apple is "Guoguang," but now it matures two months later than "Guoguang," and it is still growing on the tree when the ground freezes. It can be picked in mid-December and can be stored until June of the following year. It still tastes crisp and fresh. With it, the problem of year-round apple supply is solved. Its flesh is finer and denser than "Guoguang," and it has more sugar content and can be productive. Another major advantage is that it does not crack. Nearly 250 jin have been harvested in the past three years, and not a single fruit has cracked. Because this fruit tree is cultivated according to the natural conditions of the Northwest, it has the characteristics of drought resistance and cold resistance, and is very suitable for planting in mountainous areas. Fruit trees going up the mountains, it will be a very good variety. In the future, we will find ways to continue to improve its quality and adaptability to natural conditions.

　　"Winter Peach" was originally something that existed in China. More than two thousand years ago, it was recorded in "Erya," but later it somehow "disappeared." Fruit tree books do not mention it, and fruit tree experts do not mention it either. Ordinary people naturally don't know it exists.

　　In 1953, a strange peach tree was found in the corner of a farmer's wall in Mei County. The leaves had fallen, but the peaches were still growing on the tree. Although the fruits were very small, they were neither sour nor sweet, and had no taste at all. However, the teachers of Northwest Agricultural College regarded it as a treasure. In the spring of the following year, they were as busy as bees, traveling forty to fifty li back and forth every day, bringing the pollen of Mei County Winter Peach back to "Xining Honey Peach," and bringing the pollen of "Xining Honey Peach" to Mei County Winter Peach. The arduous but very interesting research work began in this way.

　　After five years of hard work, in the winter of 1957, six young peach trees finally grew up on the experimental farm of Northwest Agricultural College, each bearing more than 30 jin of plump, fresh peaches. One variety, which matures in October, has already become a honey peach. Each weighs four or five taels, has a lot of moisture, high sugar content, and the flesh is neither "hard" nor "rotten." It can be stored for more than a month without spoiling and can be transported to very far places. This variety made foreign experts also admire it very much. Another variety is the kind of peach used to entertain guests today. In late December, the fruit is still growing on the tree. The fruit also grows very large and beautiful, but the taste is not very sweet. The teachers of the Agricultural College are continuing to study and improve the quality of this peach. Lu Guangming, director of the Department of Horticulture and professor in charge of winter peach research, said, "Now we can eat fresh peaches for nine months of the year." Now he is using excellent varieties such as "Wugong Yellow Flesh" to cross with winter peaches, preparing to cultivate a canning variety, and also make it suitable for planting in mountainous areas. Professor Lu said that at that time, the economic value of winter peaches would be even greater.

　　Speaking of the economic value of winter apples, Associate Professor Yan Naiyou also made a calculation: According to Shaanxi Province's twelve-year plan, more than 800,000 mu of apples will be planted in the Qinling Mountains, of which more than one-third are planned to be planted with "Guoguang." If "Guoguang" encounters continuous rainy weather during the maturity period, the cracking (damage) rate will reach 30%—50%. If winter apples are planted instead, not counting their advantages of late maturity, high yield, and storage resistance, just the fact that they do not crack can increase the income of the people in the Qinling Mountains by hundreds of millions of jin of apples every year.

　　Now, the Agricultural College has begun to consider how to promote it to the mountainous areas, and according to the suggestion of the Governor of Shaanxi Province, it has named this variety "Jianshan." As the first gift from agricultural scientists to support the construction of mountainous areas. President Xin Shuzhi told us that the teachers of Northwest Agricultural College are now very energetic, and everyone regards supporting agricultural production, especially supporting agricultural production in mountainous areas, as the greatest honor. He said, "In terms of breeding, 'Jianshan Apple' is just the beginning. In the future, we will also cultivate 'Jianshan' wheat, 'Jianshan' millet, 'Jianshan' cattle, 'Jianshan' pigs..."

　　冬桃和冬苹果
　　——西北农学院教师科学研究的两项新成就
　　叶浓
    冬天，是大自然的色彩比较黯淡的季节。这时，人们如果能吃到肥美的鲜桃子、或是吃到刚从树上采下来的红艳艳的苹果，该是多好啊！
    冬至过后的一个星期天，我和武功地区的农业科学工作者十几个人，来到西北农学院实验农场。
    一进房子，我们就闻到一股浓烈的香味。原来是鲜苹果、鲜桃子摆了满桌。
    主人先把许多苹果一瓣一瓣切开，送到我们手边。其中一个新的品种，引起大家共同的兴趣：果形很像“国光”，但是比“国光”又红又大（每个平均有四两多重），颜色特别好看，吃着特别清脆，水分不多不少，味道也很香甜。这是什么品种呢，几位专家也没见过，原来这就是西北农学院园艺系副教授阎乃猷根据米丘林“定向培育”的原理，育成的“冬苹果”。
    阎乃猷介绍说，这种苹果的母本就是“国光”，而现在它要比“国光”晚熟两个月，地上结冰了，它还生长在树上。12月中旬采下来，可以放到明年6月，吃起来仍然很脆、很鲜。有了它，苹果周年供应问题就解决了。它的果肉比“国光”细密，糖分也多，能丰产。还有一个最大的优点，就是不裂果。三年来收获了近二百五十斤，没一个裂果的。这种果树，因为是按西北的自然条件培育的，具有耐旱、耐寒的特性，很适合山区种植。果树上山，它将是一个很好的品种。今后还要设法继续提高它的品质和对自然条件的适应力。
    “冬桃”在我国原是早有的东西。二千多年前的“尔雅”上，曾有过记载，后来不知怎样“失传”了，果树书上没有它，果树专家也不提它。一般人们自然也不知还有它了。
    1953年，在郿县一个农家的墙角，发现了一棵奇怪的桃树。树叶落光了，桃子还长在树上，果实虽然很小，不酸也不甜，什么味也没有。可是西北农学院的教师却如获至宝，第二年春天，他们就和蜜蜂一样，奔忙起来，每天往返四五十里，把郿县冬桃的花粉带回给“西农水蜜”，又把“西农水蜜”的花粉带给郿县冬桃。艰苦但却十分有趣的研究工作就这样开始了。
    经过五年的辛苦经营，1957年的冬天，在西北农学院的试验农场终于长起来六株年轻的桃树，每株都结了肥美的鲜桃三十多斤。其中一种十月成熟的，已经变成水蜜桃了。每个有四五两重，水分多，糖分高，果肉不“硬”不“烂”，能储一个多月不坏，可以运到很远的地方。这个品种，使外国的专家们也十分惊羡。另一品种，就是今天招待客人的这种桃子，12月下旬，果子还长在树上。果子也长得很大很美，但味道还不很香甜。农学院的教师们正在继续研究提高这种桃子的品质。负责冬桃研究的园艺系主任、路广明教授说：“现在我们在一年中，有九个月都可吃到鲜桃了。”现在他正用“武功黄肉”等优良品种和冬桃杂交，准备培育出一种制罐品种，而且使它适宜于山区种植。路教授说，那时，冬桃的经济价值就更大了。
    提起冬苹果的经济价值，阎乃猷副教授还算了一笔账：根据陕西省十二年规划，仅在秦岭山麓就要种植苹果八十多万亩，其中三分之一多拟种“国光”。而“国光”在成熟期如遇连续阴雨，裂果（坏）率就达30％—50％。如改种冬苹果，其晚熟、丰产、耐储等优点不算，仅不裂果一项，即可为秦岭山麓的人民，每年增加数亿斤苹果的收入。
    现在，农学院已开始考虑如何把它向山区推广，并且根据陕西省省长的建议，已把这个品种定名为“建山”。作为农业科学工作者支援山区建设的头一份礼物。辛树帜院长告诉我们，西北农学院的教师们，现在劲头很大，大家都把支援农业生产、特别是支援山区的农业生产，当成最大的光荣。他说，“在育种方面，‘建山苹果’只是个开始，今后我们还要培育出‘建山’麦、‘建山’谷、‘建山’牛、‘建山’猪……。”（附图片）
