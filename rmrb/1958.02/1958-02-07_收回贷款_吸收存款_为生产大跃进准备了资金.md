　　Recovering Loans and Absorbing Deposits
    Preparing Funds for the Great Leap Forward in Production

    This newspaper reports that during the past winter, 2,735 million yuan of rural credit loans were recovered, exceeding the recovery plan by 44%. Among these, the recovery of agricultural loans exceeded the plan by 9.2%, and the recovery of advance purchase deposit loans completed 81.4% of the plan. 1,400 million yuan of rural deposits were absorbed, exceeding the plan by 1.4 times. This capital is equivalent to 25% of the total amount of agricultural and sideline product purchases in the second half of last year, and is a substantial fund to support this year's Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

    In the second half of last year, the Party and the state universally carried out the socialist education movement in rural areas. The political consciousness of the peasants was greatly enhanced, and the idea of "nation first, collective second, individual last" was widely established. The broad masses of peasants actively sold grain, cotton, oil and other agricultural and sideline products, and actively repaid state loans and advance purchase deposits. More than half of the provinces across the country overfulfilled the task of recovering loans. A portion of this capital has already been used to support agricultural cooperatives in carrying out water conservancy construction and winter production. It is estimated that 1,600 million yuan of agricultural loans can be issued this year.

    In the countryside, the education on diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and managing households has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to accumulate funds for the realization of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production has been greatly enhanced. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives and peasants have deposited their temporarily unused money in banks and credit cooperatives. Last year, rural deposits reached 1,800 million yuan. It is estimated that these deposits can pay out 1,000 to 1,200 million yuan this spring. In addition to a portion used to solve the daily necessities of the peasants, most of it will also be used to solve the needs of agricultural production this spring.

    It is estimated that the capital put into rural areas through credit this year can reach more than 3,900 million yuan, which will be a great support for the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. This capital includes 1,600 million yuan in agricultural loans, 1,000 to 1,200 million yuan in deposit payments, and more than 1,000 million yuan in advance purchase deposit loans. As long as this capital is used properly, it can basically meet the needs of agricultural production.

　　收回贷款　吸收存款
    为生产大跃进准备了资金
    本报讯　去年冬季收回农村信用贷款二十七亿三千五百万元，超额44％完成了回笼计划。其中收回农贷超过计划9.2％，收回预购定金放款，完成计划81.4％，吸收农村存款十四亿元，超过计划一点四倍。这笔资金相当于去年下半年收购农副产品总金额的25％，是支援今年农业生产大跃进一笔不小的资金。
    去年下半年党和国家在农村普遍开展了社会主义教育运动，农民政治觉悟大大提高，先国家、再集体、后个人的思想普遍树立，广大农民踊跃出售粮棉和油料等农副产品，积极归还国家贷款和预购定金，全国半数以上的省超额完成了收回贷款任务。这笔资金除了有一部分已经用来支持农业社开展水利建设和冬季生产外，预计今年可发放的农贷为十六亿元。
    在农村，勤俭办社、勤俭持家的教育深入人心，广大农民为实现农业生产大跃进积累资金的积极性大大提高，所以农业社和农民把暂时不用的钱都存入银行和信用社，去年农村存款曾达十八亿元，这些存款预计今春可以支付十亿到十二亿元，除了部分用于解决农民日常生活必需的用途外，大部分也将用来解决今春农业生产的需要。
    预计今年上半年通过信用投放农村的资金可达三十九亿多元，这对农业生产大跃进将是一个很大的支援。这笔资金包括农贷十六亿元，支付存款十亿到十二亿元，发放预购定金放款十多亿元。这笔资金只要使用得当，基本上可以满足农业生产的需要。
