Short Commentary on Current Affairs

    Strenuous Battle
    "Rather shorten my life by ten years," but also "fight hard for three years." (Reported in the People's Daily) shows the revolutionary's spirit of sacrifice and fearless courage, which can inspire people to dedicate themselves. "One year of hard work, ten years of happiness, ten years of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness." (February 1st People's Daily) shows the confidence and enterprising spirit of people who have mastered their own destiny, encouraging people to ride the wind and waves to obtain happiness. The former is just the determination of a few to sacrifice for the interests of the majority; the latter is the slogan of the conscious action of the broad masses. Moreover, compared with the former, the latter is more in line with our actual situation.

    苦战
    “宁肯少活十年”，也要苦战三年”。（人民日报载）显示了革命者的牺牲精神，大无畏的气魄，可以激励人献身。“一年辛苦，十年幸福，十年辛苦，万年幸福”。（2月1日人民日报）显示了掌握了自己命运的人们的自信和进取精神，鼓舞人们乘风破浪去获取幸福。前者，只是少数人为多数人利益牺牲的决心；后者却是广大群众的自觉行动的口号。而且，较之前者，后者也更符合我们的实际。
