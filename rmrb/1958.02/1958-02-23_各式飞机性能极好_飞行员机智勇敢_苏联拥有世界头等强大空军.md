Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 22nd: Materials published in Soviet newspapers indicate that the Soviet Union is the world's leading air power, and the Soviet Air Force is a powerful force defending the airspace of the Soviet motherland and world peace.

The Soviet Union possesses a powerful fleet of jet bombers and fighter jets, as well as a strong transport aircraft fleet. Soviet Air Force transport planes are capable of airdropping numerous airborne marine personnel and combat equipment. Soviet fighter jets possess unparalleled superiority in terms of flight speed, altitude, and range. Soviet military combat aircraft have long flown faster than the speed of sound. Now, Soviet aircraft can fly at speeds one and a half times faster than the speed of sound. Not long ago, Soviet Air Force Hero Koroushkin reached speeds of over 2,000 kilometers per hour while test flying a fighter jet, matching the initial velocity of artillery shells.

The Soviet Union not only has a large number of various military aircraft with excellent performance, but also a large number of outstanding pilots. They are loyal to the motherland, resourceful and brave, and possess superb flying skills. Twenty years ago, a group of Soviet pilots, including Chkalov, flew from Moscow to the United States via the North Pole. In the last three years of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Air Force destroyed 75,000 of the 80,000 aircraft possessed by Hitler's Germany. During this war, more than 2,000 Soviet pilots were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, including 63 who received the title twice, while Pokryshkin and Kozhedub received the title three times. In addition, no less than 200,000 Air Force personnel received orders and medals.

In the post-war period, the combat effectiveness of the Soviet Air Force has been further improved. Soviet pilots can navigate along designated routes in the most complex climatic conditions, intercept enemy aircraft at stratospheric altitudes, and have mastered the technique of accurate high-altitude bombing when the ground is not visible.

The Soviet aviation industry, which has already leaped to the forefront of the world, is the strong material foundation of the Soviet Air Force. In the last three years of the Patriotic War, the Soviet Union produced an average of 40,000 aircraft per year. After the war, the aviation industry continued to supply the Air Force with a large number of new aircraft, and the performance of newly designed and manufactured aircraft has been continuously improved. For example, in the early days of the Soviet regime, Soviet-made aircraft had a flight speed of only over 200 kilometers per hour, and the MiG-9 aircraft made in 1946 had a speed of only 900 kilometers per hour, while the new Soviet aircraft can now fly at speeds of over 2,000 kilometers per hour. Twenty years ago, the aircraft designed by the famous Soviet aircraft designer Tupolev had a flight altitude of only 6,000 meters, while now the flight altitude of Soviet aircraft has reached more than 13,000 meters. Thanks to the creation of sealed cabins and special air compression devices, it is now common for aircraft to fly at altitudes of 15 to 20 kilometers.

Currently, the aircraft design institutions led by famous Soviet aircraft designers Tupolev, Ilyushin, Yakovlev, Antonov, Artyom Mikoyan, Myasishchev, Lavochkin, and Klimov are designing newer aircraft. Soviet scientists and designers are working to solve the tasks of raising the flight altitude to 34 to 35 kilometers, increasing the speed to 4,500 to 5,000 kilometers per hour, and designing and manufacturing atomic aircraft.

In terms of civil aviation aircraft manufacturing, various giant jet airliners such as the "Tu-104" and "Tu-114" manufactured by the Soviet Union have long surpassed the level of the most developed capitalist countries.

    各式飞机性能极好  飞行员机智勇敢
    苏联拥有世界头等强大空军
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联报纸刊载的材料表明，苏联是世界上头等的空军强国，苏联空军是保卫苏维埃祖国领空和世界和平的强大力量。
    苏联拥有强大的喷气式轰炸机群和歼击机群，拥有强大的运输机队。苏联空军的运输机能够从空中投掷人数众多的空军陆战队人员和战斗装备。苏联歼击机无论在飞行速度、高度、续航力方面都具有无比的优越性。苏联军用战斗飞机早就以比声音还快的速度飞行。现在，苏联飞机已经能够用比音速快一倍和一倍半的速度来飞行了。不久前，苏联空军英雄科罗乌什金试飞歼击机时速度达到了每小时二千公里以上，赶上了炮弹的初速。
    苏联不仅有大量性能极好的各式军用飞机，而且有大批优秀的飞行员。他们忠于祖国，机智勇敢，飞行技术高超。二十年前从莫斯科经过北极飞往美国的是契卡洛夫等一批苏联飞行员。在伟大卫国战争的最后三年，苏联空军击毁了希特勒德国所拥有的八万架飞机中的七万五千架。在这次战争期间，有两千多名苏联飞行员获得了苏联英雄称号，其中有六十三人两次获得苏联英雄称号，波克雷什金和阔日杜布则是三次获得苏联英雄称号。此外，得到勋章和奖章的空军人员不下二十余万。
    战后时期，苏联空军的战斗力更加提高了，苏联飞行员可以在最复杂的气候条件下沿指定路线航行，可以在同温层高度截获敌机，而且掌握了在看不到地面时高空准确投弹的技术。
    已经跃居世界前列的苏联航空工业是苏联空军的强大的物质基础。在卫国战争最后三年中，苏联每年平均生产飞机四万架。战后，航空工业部门继续供应空军大批新式飞机，新设计制造的飞机的性能不断得到改善。例如，在苏维埃政权初期，苏联制造的飞机每小时飞行速度不过二百多公里，1946年制成的米格九式飞机每小时的速度也不过九百公里，而苏联现在的新式飞机每小时可以飞行二千公里以上。二十年前，苏联著名飞机设计师图波列夫设计的飞机的飞行高度只有六千公尺，而现在苏联飞机的飞行高度已经达到一万三千公尺以上。由于密封机舱和专门空气压缩装置的制成，飞机飞到十五到二十公里高空已经是平常的现象。
    目前，苏联著名的飞机设计师图波列夫、伊柳辛、雅科夫列夫、安东诺夫、阿尔季奥姆·米高扬、米亚西谢夫、拉沃奇金、克利莫夫等人所领导的飞机设计机构正在设计更新式的飞机。苏联的科学家和设计师正在设法解决把飞行高度提高到三十四到三十五公里、速度提高到四千五百到五千公里、以及设计和制造原子飞机的任务。
    在民航机的制造方面，苏联制造的“图—104”、“图—114”等各种巨型喷气客机，早就大大超过了最发达的资本主义国家的水平。
