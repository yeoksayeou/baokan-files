The rectification movement in national enterprises, institutions, and state organs is currently experiencing a new surge. This is centered on anti-waste and anti-conservatism, setting off a new high tide of airing views and rectification. During the great airing of views on anti-waste and anti-conservatism, 250,000 big-character posters were put up in the central state organs; according to statistics from thirty-one enterprises in Beijing over twenty days, employees put up 200,000 big-character posters, raising 430,000 suggestions. The momentum of the movement is enormous, and its focus is on one direction: implementing the policy of building the country with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and promoting a great leap forward in production and work.

Judging from the situations in various regions, enterprises, and organs, this anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement is very different from previous campaigns to increase production and practice economy. This movement has actually become a struggle against backward phenomena in ideology, politics, and economics, and has formed a broad upsurge of comparing ourselves to the advanced, comparing who can achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In this magnificent movement, many conventions that have restricted the enthusiasm and productivity of the masses have been broken, many fundamental problems that have long been unresolved have been smoothly solved, and production and work in various aspects have seen obvious and rapid improvements. The implementation of the national economic plan in January is a good illustration. In previous years, the production and capital construction plans for January were always the worst performed, with a relaxed start to the year, a tightening in the middle, and a rush at the end, almost becoming a fixed pattern. This year, however, this habit was changed, and the total industrial output value in January exceeded the monthly plan by 2.5%; the situation in capital construction was also better than in any previous year. For example, the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in the commercial sector, although it has only just begun, has already seen some advanced units, based on the full awakening of the broad masses of employees, solving many problems that had not been thoroughly resolved for a long time. In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store boldly broke with convention, proposing and implementing measures to reduce personnel, save working capital, and improve service attitude. It also corrected the practice in commercial enterprises of mechanically and formalistically applying the eight-hour work system used in industrial enterprises, and implemented a one-shift-to-the-end work system.

This massive movement is clearly the product of the great socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts of our people in 1957. Precisely because of this, the masses in this movement are by no means satisfied with overcoming extravagance and waste in life, nor are they satisfied with merely demanding breakthroughs in production targets. After debating the nature and causes of waste and how to plug loopholes, many enterprises have come to a common conclusion: the responsibility for causing waste should be borne by leading staff, technical staff, and workers, and all three must improve simultaneously. Leading staff often have the problems of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and not delving deeply into their work; technical staff often only value professional skills and not politics, stick to conventions, and are not good at mobilizing and relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses; many of the worker masses also do not correctly treat the relationship between the individual and the country, and have not correctly resolved the issue of for whom they are working. In the debate meetings in many units, personnel from all three aspects simultaneously exposed and criticized their shortcomings. This eliminated officialdom, lethargy, and unhealthy trends, bourgeois ideology was criticized, and proletarian ideology was greatly elevated.

Taking anti-waste and anti-conservatism as the guiding principle has driven work in all aspects; this is the salient feature of the current rectification movement. The ultimate goal of our nationwide socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts is to greatly advance the construction work in all aspects of socialism. After the great airing of views and debates in the first two stages, the consciousness of the masses has greatly increased. Inspired by the great call to catch up with Britain in fifteen years and transform the country's appearance through three years of hard struggle, the masses cannot but demand a great leap forward in production and work, and cannot but oppose waste and conservatism. Brilliant ideological and political flowers will inevitably bear abundant economic fruits; this is a completely lawful development. Some units do not adequately recognize this situation, and in the movement, they neglect ideological work, only calculate economic accounts, and simply take some technical measures without conscientiously carrying out mass debates or thoroughly changing work methods and leadership styles. Thus, they cannot fundamentally eliminate waste, overcome conservatism, or guide the great leap forward in production. Therefore, since the current struggle is an economic struggle as well as an ideological and political struggle, we must calculate both economic accounts and ideological and political accounts. Through great airing of views and great debates, we must not only eliminate waste and conservatism, but also eliminate bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. We must, through and in conjunction with the struggle against waste and conservatism, thoroughly improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, raise the socialist consciousness of all employees, break down those conventions that hinder the rapid development of productive forces, streamline institutions, improve production management and labor organization, improve production technology, and reduce production costs, so as to implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results and promote a great leap forward in production.

Some people, although they recognize the importance of ideological work, adopt the wrong approach. They organize the masses to abstractly discuss some fundamental issues, and as a result, in the debate meetings, the masses often do not know what is being discussed. Of course, major fundamental issues, such as the individual and the collective, freedom and discipline, the relationship between workers and peasants, the leading position of the working class, etc., must be clearly debated among the masses. But in the current stage, this debate must be directed at the specific tasks of production and work. Many enterprises, through specific debates on anti-waste and anti-conservatism, have guided the broad masses to recognize the above principles, and they have immediately translated them into action while debating and rectifying. Compared to the former approach, isn't this approach much more vivid and profound? We say that taking anti-waste and anti-conservatism as the guiding principle means first and foremost that it should be taken as the guiding principle of the current rectification phase, and that through it, the current rectification task should be completed; the two should never be separated. If we disregard the issues that the masses are most concerned about and fail to guide them accordingly, solving ideological problems by solving specific problems, we will inevitably fail.

Many enterprises, schools, and organs have decided to make the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement the center of the rectification phase, which is correct. It is hoped that all enterprises, schools, and organs across the country will follow their example, strive for the complete victory of this new task of the rectification movement, and thereby achieve a comprehensive great leap forward in our country's socialist cause!

### 反浪费反保守是当前整风运动的中心任务

    反浪费反保守是当前整风运动的中心任务
    整风运动在全国的企业、事业单位和国家机关里，目前出现了一个新的洪峰。这就是以反浪费和反保守为中心，掀起了一个新的鸣放高潮和整改高潮。在反浪费反保守的大鸣大放中，中央各国家机关内贴出了二十五万张大字报；北京市三十一个企业二十天的统计，职工们就贴出了二十万张大字报，提出四十三万条意见。运动声势浩大，锋芒集中在一个方向：贯彻多快好省勤俭建国的方针，促进生产和工作的大跃进。
    从各地区各企业和各机关的情况看来，这次的反浪费反保守运动，同过去历次的增产节约运动有很大的不同。这次运动实际上已经成为反对思想、政治、经济各方面落后现象的斗争，已经形成了一个广泛地比先进、比多快好省的高潮。在这个波澜壮阔的运动中，很多束缚群众积极性和生产力发展的陈规被冲破了，很多长期不得解决的根本性问题顺利的解决了，各方面的生产和工作已经有了明显的迅速的改进。1月份国民经济计划执行情况就是一个很好的说明。历年来，1月份生产和基建计划总是完成得最不好的，年初松，年中紧，年底赶，几乎成了一个定例。而今年却一改积习，1月份的工业总产值超额2.5％完成了月计划；基本建设的情况也比过去任何一年都好。再如商业部门中的反浪费反保守运动，虽然还开始不久，某些先进单位却已经在广大职工觉悟充分提高的基础上，解决了许多长期没有彻底解决的问题。北京天桥百货商场在反浪费反保守运动中大胆地突破了常规，提出了并且实现了减少人员、节约流动资金、改善服务态度的措施，并且纠正了在商业企业中机械地形式主义地搬用工业企业中工作八小时的现象，实行一班到底的工作制度。
    这个声势浩大的运动，显然是1957年我国人民在思想战线、政治战线上的伟大的社会主义革命的产物。正因为这样，群众在这个运动中决不满足于克服生活中的铺张浪费，也决不满足于仅仅要求产量指标的突破。许多企业在辩论了浪费的性质、原因和如何堵塞漏洞等问题以后，得出了一个共同的结论：造成浪费的责任应该由领导工作人员、技职人员和工人三方面担负，这三方面都必须同时改进。领导工作人员往往有官僚主义、主观主义、不深入地钻研业务的毛病；技职人员往往只重业务不重政治，墨守陈规，不善于发动和依靠群众的积极性创造性；工人群众中也有许多人没有正确对待个人和国家的关系，没有正确解决为谁劳动的问题。在许多单位的辩论会上，三方面的人员都同时揭发和批判了自己的缺点。这样就打掉了官气、暮气和邪气，资产阶级思想受到批判，无产阶级思想大大抬头。
    以反浪费反保守为纲，带动了各方面的工作，这就是当前整风运动的显著特征。我国全民性的政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，其最终目的本来就是为了要把社会主义各方面的建设工作大大推进一步。经过前两个阶段的大争大辩，群众的觉悟大大提高了。在十五年赶上英国和苦战三年、改变面貌的伟大号召的鼓舞下，群众不能不要求生产和工作的大跃进，不能不反浪费反保守。灿烂的思想政治之花，必然结成丰满的经济之果，这是完全合乎规律的发展。有些单位对于这个形势认识不足，在运动中忽视思想工作，只算经济账，简单地从技术上采取一些措施，而不认真开展群众性的争辩，不彻底转变工作方法和领导作风。这样，他们也就不能从根本上杜绝浪费现象，克服保守主义，引导生产的大跃进。因此，目前的斗争既然是一个经济上的斗争，同时又是一个思想政治的斗争，既要算经济账，又要算思想账、政治账。通过大鸣大放，大争大辩，不但要反掉浪费，反掉保守，而且要反掉官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义。要通过和结合反浪费反保守的斗争，彻底改进干部和群众的关系，提高全体职工群众的社会主义觉悟，打破那些妨碍生产力迅速发展的陈规，精简机构，改善生产管理和劳动组织，改进生产技术，降低生产费用，以便贯彻执行多快好省的方针，促进生产的大跃进。
    有一些人虽然认识了思想工作的重要，但是他们采取的办法却是错误的。他们组织群众去抽象地讨论一些原则问题，结果在辩论会上，群众往往不知所云。当然，重大的原则问题，例如个人和集体、自由和纪律、工农关系、工人阶级的领导地位等等，都必须在群众中辩论清楚。但是在目前阶段，这种辩论必须针对生产和工作的具体任务。很多企业，通过反浪费反保守的具体辩论，引导广大群众认清了上述的原则，并且边辩边改，立即见诸行动。拿这种作法同前一种作法相比，岂不生动得多，深刻得多吗？我们说，以反浪费反保守为纲，首先就是说要以它作为当前整改阶段的纲，通过它来完成当前的整改任务，决不能把这两件事分割开来。如果抛去群众最关心的问题不管，不去因势利导，从解决具体问题中去解决思想问题，那就必然会失败。
    许多企业、学校和机关已经决定，要把反浪费反保守运动作为整改阶段的中心，这是正确的。希望全国所有的企业、学校和机关，都向他们看齐，争取整风运动的这个新任务的彻底胜利，从而使我国的社会主义事业实现一个全面的大跃进！
