At the Memorial Service for Comrade Huang Jing Held by People from All Walks of Life in the Capital, Comrade Bo Yibo's Eulogy

Comrade Huang Jing, member of the Central Committee of our Party, passed away due to illness in Guangzhou at 4:00 PM on February 10, 1958. We are deeply saddened by this news.

Comrade Huang Jing was an outstanding member of our Party, a loyal revolutionary fighter of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Party, Comrade Huang Jing made important contributions to the revolutionary cause of the working class in complex and difficult environments.

In his youth, Comrade Huang Jing embraced Marxism-Leninism, and he joined the Communist Party of China in 1932. Soon after joining the Party, he took charge of the underground Party work in Qingdao and Beiping. Under the White Terror, he actively participated in the great national liberation struggle of that time. Comrade Huang Jing was one of the organizers and leaders of the "December 9th" Movement, which has great significance in the history of China's revolutionary movement. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Huang Jing accepted the Party's order and transferred to work in the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines. Comrade Huang Jing played an important role in the struggle to create and maintain the Jizhong Anti-Japanese Base Area. He correctly implemented the Party's policy of the Anti-Japanese National United Front, widely united all anti-Japanese strata in Jizhong at that time, and organized mass armed struggles. Together with other comrades, he researched, summarized, and promoted the anti-Japanese struggle experience of the people, and created various forms of anti-Japanese struggle suitable for the plains areas. He also made significant contributions to the struggle to consolidate and develop the Jilu豫 (JiluYu) Plains Anti-Japanese Base Area. In the difficult and cruel war environment, he creatively completed the Party's tasks and demonstrated a style of close contact with the masses. During the Liberation War, Comrade Huang Jing served as the Second Deputy Secretary of the Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Huang Jing, while leading the work in Tianjin, similarly implemented the Party's policy of mobilizing and relying on the masses, and made significant achievements in restoring and developing production, implementing democratic reforms, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. In 1952, Comrade Huang Jing took the post of Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, and in 1956, he became the Director of the State Technological Commission. Because Comrade Huang Jing and the comrades of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry resolutely implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee, worked together with the vast number of workers in the national machinery industry enterprises, and actively promoted the development of China's machinery industry, gradually changing the repair-oriented machinery industry inherited from old China into a machinery manufacturing industry, thus fundamentally changing the face of China's machinery industry. By the end of the First Five-Year Plan, China's machinery industry had been able to manufacture more than 60% of the machinery and equipment needed for China's economic construction. This great achievement is inseparable from Comrade Huang Jing's efforts. Recently, in order to adapt to the needs of the great development of China's industry and agriculture, he has tirelessly conducted investigations and research on the technical transformation of China's industry and transportation and the mechanization of China's agriculture. It should be particularly pointed out that in responding to the call of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao to be both red and expert, he was one of the Central Committee members who studied it relatively well, and we should all learn from him.

Comrade Huang Jing had a high degree of enthusiasm, creativity, and loyalty to the revolutionary cause of the Party and the working class. He actively strived to combine the Party's policies with concrete revolutionary practice in his work, and did everything possible to complete the work tasks assigned to him by the Party. His style of being good at uniting comrades and maintaining close ties with the masses, his fervent and selfless enthusiasm for work and learning, and his spirit of daring to break with convention and being good at accepting new things are all examples for us Communists and revolutionary cadres to learn from.

Comrade Huang Jing's unfortunate death in his prime is a heavy loss to our Party, the Chinese working class, and the people of the whole country in the upsurge of socialist construction.

In mourning Comrade Huang Jing, the task of all our comrades is to learn from Comrade Huang Jing's excellent qualities and fine style, strive to continuously improve our awareness politically, diligently and assiduously study technology, and create a strong contingent of cadres who are both red and expert, so that the level of our industry and the entire technical level will continue to rise.

Excellent communist fighter, dear comrade-in-arms, Huang Jing, farewell! All of us comrades will always remember you, and the cause to which you dedicated yourself will always develop victoriously. May you rest in peace! (Attached picture)

    在首都各界公祭黄敬同志的仪式上
    薄一波同志的悼词
    我党中央委员会委员黄敬同志，于1958年2月10日下午4时因病在广州逝世。听到这个消息，我们感到万分悲痛。
    黄敬同志是我们党的优秀党员，是中国工人阶级和中国人民的忠实的革命战士。在党的领导下，黄敬同志曾经在复杂和艰难的环境里，对工人阶级的革命事业作出了重要的贡献。
    黄敬同志在青年时期，就接受了马克思列宁主义，他在1932年加入了中国共产党。入党以后不久，他就担任了青岛市和北平市的地下党的负责工作，在白色恐怖下，积极地参加了当时的伟大的民族解放斗争。黄敬同志是在我国革命运动史上具有重要意义的“一二·九”运动的组织者和领导者之一。抗日战争爆发以后，黄敬同志接受党的命令，转入敌后抗日根据地工作。黄敬同志在创造和坚持冀中抗日根据地的斗争中起了重要的作用。他正确地执行了党的抗日民族统一战线政策，广泛地团结了当时冀中各抗日阶层，组织了群众性的武装斗争。他和其他同志一道，研究、总结和发挥了人民群众的抗日斗争经验，创造了适合于平原地区的各种各样的抗日斗争形式。在巩固和发展冀鲁豫平原抗日根据地的斗争中，他也有显著的功绩。在困难的和残酷的战争环境里面，他创造性地完成了党的任务，表现了密切联系群众的作风。在解放战争时期，黄敬同志担任晋察冀中央局第二副书记。中华人民共和国成立以后，黄敬同志在领导天津市的工作中，同样地贯彻执行了党的关于发动群众依靠群众的方针，在恢复和发展生产、实行民主改革、改造资本主义工商业方面，作出了重大的成绩。1952年，黄敬同志担任第一机械工业部部长的工作，1956年又担任国家技术委员会主任的职务。由于黄敬同志和第一机械工业部的同志们坚决执行党中央的指示，同全国机械工业企业的广大职工共同努力，积极地推动了我国机械工业的发展，把旧中国所遗留下来的修配性的机械工业，逐步改变成为机械制造工业，这样就根本改变了我国的机械工业的面貌。到第一个五年计划期末，我国的机械工业已经能够自己制造我国经济建设中所需要的机械设备的60％以上，这个巨大的成就是同黄敬同志的努力分不开的。最近为了适应我国工业和农业大发展的需要，他对我国工业、交通运输业的技术改造和我国农业机械化的问题，又孜孜不倦地进行了调查研究。应该特别指出：在响应中央和毛主席又红又专的号召上，在我们中央委员中间他是钻研得比较好的一个，我们大家都应该向他学习。
    黄敬同志对党和工人阶级的革命事业具有高度的积极性、创造性和忠心，他积极努力把党的方针政策同具体的革命实践在工作中结合起来，千方百计地去完成党所交给他的工作任务。他的善于团结同志、密切联系群众的作风，他的发奋忘我的工作热情和学习热情，他的敢于打破常规、善于接受新鲜事物的精神，都是我们共产党人和革命干部学习的榜样。
    黄敬同志在壮年时期不幸逝世，这是我们党的、中国工人阶级和全国人民在社会主义建设高潮中的沉重损失。
    在悼念黄敬同志的时候，我们全体同志的任务，就是学习黄敬同志的优秀品质和优良作风，努力在政治上不断地提高觉悟，在技术上顽强地刻苦钻研，造成强大的又红又专的干部队伍，使我国的工业水平和整个技术水平不断地高涨。
    优秀的共产主义战士，亲爱的战友黄敬同志，永别了！我们所有的同志将永远记忆着你，你所献身的事业将永远胜利发展。愿你安息！（附图片）
