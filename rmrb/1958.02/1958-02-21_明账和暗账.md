    Notes

    In his "Mutual Security Program" message, Eisenhower presented an account to the US Congress, concluding that America's "foreign aid" was of great benefit to the United States. Leaving aside "military aid," even the so-called "economic and technical assistance" to underdeveloped countries was to open up "vast markets" for American goods and investment and to obtain a "large amount of essential materials that must be imported from abroad."

    When the United States promotes itself abroad, it also frequently calculates the "US aid" account, but its calculation method is completely different from the current method. The account calculated in that situation always said that the United States had no selfish motives in "foreign aid," and that "recipient countries" benefited immensely.

    One account is the open book for the outside world, and the other is the secret book calculated for its own people. It goes without saying which is true and which is false.

    明账和暗账
    艾森豪威尔在他的“共同安全计划”咨文里，向美国国会算了一笔账，结论是，美国的“对外援助”对美国是大有好处的。撇开“军事援助”不说，就是对不发达国家的所谓“经济和技术援助”，也是为了给美国开辟商品和投资的“广大市场”，并且取得“大量不得不从国外输入的必需物资”。
    美国在向国外宣传的时候，也经常算“美援”这笔账，可是它的算法同现在的算法却截然不同。在那种情况下算出来的账，总是说美国在“对外援助”中毫无自私目的，而“受援国家”则是得利非浅。
    这两笔账，一笔是对外的明账，一笔是算给自己人听的暗账，孰真孰假，自然是不用再说的了。
