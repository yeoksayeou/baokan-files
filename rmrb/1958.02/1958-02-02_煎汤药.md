　　Decoction of Traditional Chinese Medicine
　　Dong Xinzhang

　　Since ancient times, people have called traditional Chinese medicine "decoction," because most Chinese medicines are in the form of decoctions. Because decoctions are easily absorbed by the human body and can achieve therapeutic effects quickly, they are the main prescriptions in traditional Chinese medicine. However, if the decoction is not prepared properly, it greatly affects the therapeutic effect.

　　First of all, the best utensils for decocting medicine are porcelain pots or earthenware pots. Because these two kinds of pots transfer heat slowly, they can dissolve the effective components of the medicine gently, and the medicinal properties will not change. Never use iron, copper, aluminum or other metal utensils to decoct medicine, because when the medicine is heated in metal utensils, it will have a chemical reaction, which will not only destroy the medicinal properties, but may also produce toxins.

　　After the medicine is put into the pot, first soak it in cold water for more than ten minutes to allow it to penetrate, so as to facilitate the decoction of the medicinal liquid. The amount of water for decocting medicine depends on the volume of the medicine. Generally, the water should be about one inch higher than the medicine, but the tonic medicine should be appropriately less water (if some medicines float with the water, you can stir it and then measure the water level). Well water, river water, natural water, and tap water are all suitable for decocting medicine, but attention must be paid to cleanliness, hygiene and freshness.

　　The heat during decoction is particularly important. Tonifying and antiperspirant medicines must be decocted with a slow fire (simmering heat) to fully decoct the effective components of the medicine. Purgative medicines, diaphoretic medicines, and emetic medicines can be decocted with a strong fire (high heat), but not too vigorously, so as to avoid burning them dry. Some people accidentally burn the medicine dry and add some water to decoct it again, which greatly reduces the efficacy of the medicine.

　　The decoction time should be determined according to the nature of the medicine. Generally, half an hour is enough for general medicine, fifteen minutes is enough for diaphoretic medicine, and one hour is needed for tonic medicine. A dose of decoction can be decocted twice. After filtering out the first decoction, add less water than the first time and decoct it again. It is useless to decoct it any more, because the effective components of the medicine are gone.

　　Decoction is a combination of many medicines. The degree of dissolution of each medicine is different. If they are put into the pot at the same time, often some medicinal properties have volatilized and lost their efficacy, while some have not yet dissolved, failing to achieve the expected effect. Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions often indicate that some medicines should be decocted first, and some should be added later or taken with boiled water. Generally speaking, mineral or hard medicines such as mirabilite, alum, and gypsum should be added first, because they need more time to decoct the effective components; astragalus, codonopsis, ginkgo, chrysanthemum and other plant rhizomes, flowers and fruits can be added later; mint, uncaria and other highly volatile medicines should be added last. Precious medicines such as bezoar, antelope horn, and coptis chinensis are generally not decocted in a pot, but are ground into a fine powder and "taken with the decoction" in order to fully exert their therapeutic effects.

　　煎汤药
　　董信章
    自古以来，人们就把中药叫作汤药，这是因为中药大都是汤剂的缘故。由于汤药容易被人体吸收，能够较快地收到治疗效果，因此汤药是中医临床的主要处方。但是，汤药煎得不得法，影响治疗效果很大。
    首先，煎药用的器皿最好是瓷锅或砂锅。因为这两种锅子传热比较慢，能使药物的有效成分缓和地溶解出来，而且药性也不会变化。千万不要用铁锅、铜锅、铝锅或其它金属器皿煎药，因为药物放在金属器皿加热后会起化学作用，不仅药性被破坏，而且可能发生毒素。
    药物放进锅里以后，先用凉水浸泡十多分钟，使之渗透，便于把药液煎出。煎药用水多少，要看药物的体积，一般是水比药高出一寸左右就可，但补剂药要酌情少放些水（如果有些药随水浮起，可以搅拌后再量水位）。煎药的水，井水、河水、天然水、自来水都行，但必须注意清洁卫生和新鲜。
    煎药时的火候特别值得注意。补虚、散汗药一定要用文火（微火）煎，使药的有效成分充分的煎出来。泻剂药、发汗药、呕吐药可用武火（大火）煎，但不要过猛，以免煎干。有人不小心把药煎干了，又加些水再煎，这样药效就大大降低了。
    煎药的时间要根据药性而定。一般药半小时左右，发汗药十五分钟就够了，滋补性药需要一个钟头。一剂汤药可煎二次，头煎的药液滤出后，再加进比第一次量要少些的水另煎一次。再多煎是没有用的，因为药的有效成分已经没有了。
    汤药是许多味药配在一起的。各味药的溶解程度不同，如果同时入锅，往往有的药性已经挥发而失去疗效，有的则还没有溶解，达不到预期的效果。所以，中医处方常常注明某些药先煎，某些后下或冲服。一般说来，寒水石、明矾、石膏等矿产类或硬性药物要先投放，因为它们需要较多的时间才能煎出有效成分来；黄芪、党参、白果、菊花等植物根茎花果类可以后投入；薄荷、钩滕等挥发性很强的药要最后投入。还有牛黄、羚羊角、黄连等珍贵药物，一般不放在锅里煎，而是碾成细末“和药冲服”，以便充分发挥它们的疗效作用。
