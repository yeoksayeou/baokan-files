We completely agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's and Bo Yibo's reports on the national budget and national economic plan, and Chairman Wu Yuzhang's report on writing reform. Now we would like to offer some opinions on further improving higher agricultural education.

In Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report, it was pointed out that political and ideological leadership must be strengthened in the fields of culture and education. Our education system should be further improved in accordance with the principle of combining mental and physical labor. At the same time, in order to adapt to the high tide of socialist construction, we must further improve the quality of various cultural and educational tasks under the principle of running schools diligently and thriftily. Specific measures include running experimental farms and pastures well in agricultural colleges, engaging in education and production labor at the same time, and striving to achieve self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency after a certain period. In addition, contracts should be signed with agricultural cooperatives to regularly have students and teachers take turns to work in the cooperatives and help them carry out technological reforms. We fully support this policy and are willing to work hard to realize it.

In the current great leap forward in agricultural production, the work of higher agricultural colleges is far behind production and the masses, and we should catch up quickly.

Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, higher agricultural colleges have undergone fundamental changes through a series of teaching reforms and political and ideological work. For example, the addition of production teaching as an important part of the teaching plan allows students to spend nearly a year participating in labor production and technical work in school farms, state-owned farms, and agricultural cooperatives during their four and a half years of study, which closely connects theory and practice. The teaching content has absorbed advanced Soviet science, improved the ideological level of dialectical materialism of teachers and students, and also reflects the situation of agricultural production and research work in our country. Research work such as creating high-yield new varieties, preventing and controlling diseases, pests, and animal epidemics has also played a certain role in promoting agricultural production. The proportion of workers and peasants among students has also been increasing year by year. Especially in the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, the political and ideological awareness of teachers and staff has been further improved, and bourgeois ideas such as being divorced from production and looking down on labor have been criticized. Now many teachers and students are asking to go to the countryside and mountains to participate in physical labor and production training, so that they can become working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert. This is indeed a new atmosphere.

However, we are in the midst of the great wave of the great leap forward in agricultural production. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the 500 million peasants of the country are engaging in the extremely magnificent struggle of water conservancy construction and natural transformation with great momentum. They are constantly creating high-yield records of thousands of catties and double thousands of catties per mu. These heroic and victorious achievements were created by the working people. What makes us feel ashamed is that such achievements do not come from higher agricultural colleges. This makes us deeply realize that our work is far behind production and behind the masses. If we do not catch up quickly and strive for a leap forward, we will not be promoting production but dragging it down, and we will not be promoters but retarders. This is what we must be vigilant about.

Three Aspects of Improving Higher Agricultural Education

How can we change this backward situation? Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report has already pointed out a direction.

Adhere to the orientation of serving production, strengthen the combination of physical and mental labor, run the school's farms and pastures well, and further strengthen ties with agricultural cooperatives.

First, we must adhere to the orientation of serving production, strengthen the combination of physical and mental labor, mobilize the whole school, teach and produce at the same time, run the school's farms and pastures well, further strengthen ties with agricultural cooperatives, and help them carry out technological reforms.

The teaching and research work of higher agricultural colleges serves production. Before the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, rightist elements vigorously opposed the orientation of serving production. They said that higher agricultural education was to train research talents, and engaging in production was the business of secondary technical schools, which would lower the level. Therefore, they opposed running large farms and opposed engaging in production. Some teachers were influenced by this idea, so they were unwilling to engage in production and unwilling to work on farms. This serious bourgeois idea of being divorced from production and looking down on labor must be thoroughly criticized. We believe that we must adhere to the orientation of serving production. We should take mastering production operation techniques as the primary condition for agricultural talents. We should require teachers and students of higher agricultural colleges to use their scientific and technological knowledge and labor to run their own farms and pastures well, and constantly study how to realize technological reforms and create advanced production operation techniques and high-yield records in their own farms and pastures. Only such schools do not deviate from reality and can train soldiers on the agricultural production front.

Taking our work at Beijing Agricultural University as an example. Although the production of our farm is still backward, we are determined to run it well. We believe that this is necessary and possible. This farm was established last year by our school in cooperation with the Oriental Agricultural Cooperative. It has 14,000 mu of land and more than 1,000 farmers. After a year of joint efforts with the farmers, various crops have exceeded the original planned targets. The output of grain exceeded the plan by 240,000 catties, cotton by 24,000 catties, and the profit turned over to the state was 77,000 yuan. The living standards of most members have reached the level of middle peasants. We require that the production in 1958 exceed the requirements of the agricultural development program, cross the Yellow River, and reach 500 to 600 catties of grain per mu. In addition to appropriately increasing the income of farmers, there should also be profits turned over to the state of about 200,000 yuan. We believe that running school farms well is a good way to test teaching and scientific research in production and an important measure to run agricultural colleges well.

Organize young intellectuals to participate in labor training, open cadre classes for worker-peasant cadres, and strive to train a backbone force on the agricultural front who are both red and expert in a short period of time.

Second, higher agricultural colleges must strive to train working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert. The anti-rightist struggle has made us deeply realize the importance of political and ideological work. Only by striving to train working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert can we guarantee the victory of socialist construction. In the past, we had shortcomings in implementing this policy. On the one hand, we did not do enough work to transform the ideology of intellectuals, we did not grasp the production labor training of young intellectuals tightly enough, and we did not provide enough guidance to senior intellectuals to combine their work with in-depth study of Marxism-Leninism to improve their ideological level of dialectical materialism. At the same time, we did not take the initiative to set up short-term training courses for revolutionary cadres and peasants to improve their professional skills. In the future, we must resolutely implement the policy of being both red and expert, organize young intellectuals to participate in labor production training in batches and phases, such as going to high-yield base points to live and work with the farmers. At the same time, summarizing the farmers' high-yield experience can better embody the combination of physical and mental labor, which is more conducive to promoting agricultural production. We have also formulated methods for students to work and study to encourage them to engage in physical labor and develop a spirit of diligence and thrift. At the same time, under the overall arrangement of the higher authorities, we will open cadre classes for revolutionary cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds who have considerable agricultural production experience and cultural level, and train them to university level within two years. In this way, we can train a group of backbone forces on the agricultural production front who are both red and expert for the country in a short period of time.

Implement the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily, and carry out comprehensive research to solve major production problems.

Third, we must implement the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily, carry out comprehensive research to solve major production problems, improve the quality of universities, and promote the great leap forward in agricultural production. Scientific research in universities has already had a certain foundation. For example, our school has cultivated excellent varieties of wheat and corn, which increase yields by 20% to 30% compared with farmers' varieties, and has also made some achievements in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. However, modern agricultural biological science is developing rapidly, and many problems in domestic production still require modern scientific methods to research and solve. If we neglect to learn and master the advanced science of various countries in the world, we will fall behind the times. Therefore, while facing production, running farms well, and deeply summarizing the farmers' production experience, we must improve the scientific level and organize comprehensive research to solve major production problems. Higher agricultural colleges have been placed under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture, and various colleges and universities are conducting close cooperation with agricultural scientific research institutions to uniformly allocate human and material resources and give full play to the potential of both parties to solve major problems in current production. We know that the division of labor in modern science is becoming more and more detailed, and the field that each scientific worker studies is becoming narrower. However, the problems that need to be solved in production are extremely complex. Therefore, comprehensive research by experts in various related fields in agriculture has become an inevitable trend and an inevitable law to solve all major problems. The great achievements of Soviet science are the concentrated expression of the collective wisdom of Soviet scientists. Therefore, in agriculture, whether it is creating new varieties, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, improving soil, increasing the unit area yield of crops, improving livestock breeds, preventing and controlling animal epidemics, etc., it is necessary to gather the strength of experts in various fields to conduct comprehensive research. We must learn this spirit, guide scientific research from individuals to collectives, and integrate higher education institutions and agricultural scientific research institutions to achieve the policy of close integration of teaching research and production, so as to promote the continuous leap forward of agricultural science and agricultural production in our country.

The great socialist construction is riding the wind and waves and advancing rapidly. Our higher agricultural colleges must mobilize, give full play to their potential, closely follow this wave, and strive for the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    坚持面向生产　坚持又红又专　坚持勤俭办学
    改革高等农业教育的三大关键
    孙晓村　沈其益代表对改进高等农业教育问题提出几点意见
    我们完全同意李先念、薄一波副总理关于国家预算和国民经济计划的报告，吴玉章主任关于文字改革的报告。现在就进一步改进高等农业教育问题，提出一些意见。
    在薄一波副总理的报告中指出，在文教方面必须加强政治思想领导。应该根据脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的原则，进一步改进我们的教育制度，同时要适应社会主义建设的高潮，在勤俭办学的原则下，进一步提高各项文教工作的质量。在具体措施上指出农业院校要办好实验农场和牧场，一面从事教育一面从事生产劳动。并且要力争在一定的时期以后，做到自给或半自给。此外还要与农业合作社订立合同，经常使学生和教员轮流到合作社去劳动，并帮助合作社进行技术改革。我们完全拥护这个方针，并愿为其实现而努力。
    在目前农业生产大跃进的浪潮里，高等农业院校的工作远远落后于生产、落后于群众，应该急起直追。
    解放以来，高等农业院校，在党和政府的正确领导下，通过一系列的教学改革和政治思想工作，已经起了基本的变化。例如在教学计划中增添了生产教学这一重要环节，使学生在四年半的学习期间内有近一年的时间参加学校农场，国营农场和农业合作社的劳动生产和技术工作，密切了理论和实际的联系。在教学内容上吸取了苏联先进科学，提高了师生的辩证唯物主义的思想水平，同时也反映了我国农业生产和研究工作的情况，研究工作如创造丰产新品种，防治病虫害和兽疫等，在农业生产上也起了一定的推动作用。学生中的工农成份也逐年有所提高。特别是在整风反右斗争中，教职员的政治思想觉悟都有了进一步的提高，批判脱离生产、轻视劳动等资产阶级思想。现在许多教师和学生都要求下乡上山参加体力劳动和生产锻炼。使自己成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。这确是一种新兴的气象。
    但是，我们正处在农业生产大跃进的伟大浪潮里。在党和政府的领导下，全国五亿农民正在千军万马，排山倒海地从事着极其宏伟的兴修水利和改造自然的斗争。他们不断创造出亩产千斤和双千斤的高额丰产纪录。这些英勇胜利的成果，都是劳动人民创造出来的。使我们感到惭愧的是这样的成果却不是来自高等农业院校。这就使我们深刻认识到我们的工作远远落后于生产，落后于群众。如果不急起直追，争取跃进。我们便不是促进生产而是在拖着生产，就不是促进派而是促退派了。这是我们必须警惕的。
    改进高等农业教育的三个方面
    如何才能改变这种落后状态呢？在薄一波副总理的报告中，已经指出了一个方向。
    坚持面向生产的方针，加强体力劳动和脑力劳动的结合，办好学校的农场和牧场，进一步加强同农业社的联系。
    首先，我们必须坚持面向生产的方针。加强体力劳动和脑力劳动的结合，全校动手，一面教学，一面生产，办好学校的农场和牧场，进一步加强和农业社的联系，帮助他们进行技术改革。
    高等农业院校的教学和研究工作是为生产服务的，在整风反右以前，右派分子曾经极力反对为生产服务的方针，他们说高等农业教育是培养研究人才的，搞生产是中等技术学校的事情，会降低水平。因此反对办大农场，反对搞生产。一些教师受了这种思想的影响，就不愿搞生产，不愿到农场中去工作。这种严重的脱离生产，轻视劳动的资产阶级思想必须彻底批判。我们认为必须坚持面向生产的方针。应该把掌握生产操作技术，作为农业人才的首要条件。我们应该要求高等农业院校的教师和学生，用自己的科学技术知识和劳动，办好自己的农场和牧场，不断钻研在自己的农场、牧场里实现技术改革，创造出一套先进的生产操作技术，创造出高额的丰产纪录。这样的学校才是不脱离实际，才能培养农业生产战线上的战士。
    拿我们工作的北京农业大学作例子。我们农场的生产虽然还落后。但是我们有决心把它办好，我们认为这是必要的，也是可能的。这个农场是我校去年与东方农业合作社合作建立的。有一万四千亩土地和一千多户农民。经过一年来与农民共同努力，各种作物都超过原订计划指标。超产粮食二十四万斤，棉花二万四千斤，上缴利润七万七千元，场员生活大都达到中农的水平。我们要求一九五八年的生产，超过农业发展纲要的要求，要跨过黄河，粮食达到每亩五百至六百斤，除适当地提高农民收入外，还要有上缴利润约二十万元。我们认为办好学校农场正是在生产中考验教学和科学研究的好办法，是办好农业院校的重要措施。
    组织青年知识分子参加劳动锻炼，为工农干部开设干部班，争取短期内培养又红又专的农业战线上的骨干。
    其次，高等农业院校，必须努力培养又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子。从反右斗争中，使我们深刻体会到政治思想工作的重要性。只有努力培养又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子才能保证社会主义建设的胜利。过去，我们在贯彻执行这个方针上是有缺点的，一方面我们对知识分子思想改造的工作还做得不够，对青年知识分子的生产劳动锻炼抓得不够紧，对高级知识分子也没有足够地多方引导他们结合业务深入钻研马列主义提高辩证唯物主义的思想水平。同时也没有主动地设法为革命干部和农民开设短期学习班，提高他们的专业技术。今后我们必须坚决贯彻执行又红又专的方针，组织青年知识分子分批分期参加劳动生产锻炼，如到高额丰产的基点与农民同生活同劳动，同时总结农民的丰产经验，这样更可以体现体力劳动与脑力劳动的结合，对推动农业生产更为有利。对学生，我们也已制订了勤工俭学的办法，鼓励他们进行体力劳动，养成勤劳俭朴的风气。同时要在上级的统筹安排下，为工农出身的有相当农业生产经验和文化水平的革命干部开设干部班，在二年内把他们培养提高到大学的水平。这样就可以在短期内为国家培养出一批又红又专的农业生产战线上的骨干。
    贯彻勤俭办学的方针，开展解决生产上重大问题的综合研究。
    第三，必须贯彻勤俭办学的方针，开展解决生产上重大问题的综合研究，提高高等学校的质量，促进农业生产的大跃进。高等学校的科学研究已经有了一定的基础，例如我们的学校已经培育出优良的小麦、玉米品种，较农家品种提高产量百分之二十至三十，在防除病虫害方面也有一些成绩，但是现代农业生物科学正在飞跃地向前发展，国内许多生产中的问题，还要求用现代的科学方法研究解决。如果我们忽视了学习和掌握运用世界各国的先进科学，我们就要落在时代的后面。因此在面向生产办好农场、深入总结农民的生产经验的同时，必须提高科学水平，组织解决生产上重大生产问题的综合研究。高等农业院校已划归农业部领导，各个院校正与农业科学研究机关进行密切协作，统一调配人力物力，发挥双方的潜力，解决当前生产中的重大问题。我们知道现代科学的分工，越来越细密，每个科学工作所钻研的领域就更窄狭。而生产中所需解决的问题又是异常错综复杂。因此农业中各个有关方面的专家进行综合研究就成为解决一切重大问题的一个必然趋势，也是一个必然的规律。苏联科学的伟大成就，是苏联科学家集体智慧的集中表现。因此在农业上无论是创造新的品种，防治病虫害，改良土壤，提高作物的单位面积产量，改良牲畜品种，防治兽疫等等，都要集合各方面专家的力量，进行综合研究。我们必须学习这种精神，把科学研究从个人引向集体，把高等院校和农业科学研究机关打成一片，实现教学研究与生产密切结合的方针，才能推动我国农业科学和农业生产不断向前跃进。
    伟大的社会主义建设正在乘风破浪、一日千里地前进着。我们高等农业院校必须动员起来，发挥潜在力量，紧紧地跟上这个浪潮，为农业生产的大跃进而奋斗。
