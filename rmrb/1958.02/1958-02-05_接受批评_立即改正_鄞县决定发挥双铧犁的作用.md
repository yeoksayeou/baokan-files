　　(From Zhejiang Daily) The Yin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after reading the newspaper criticism regarding their lax leadership in promoting the double-wheeled double-share plow, has conducted a preliminary self-examination of their guiding ideology and work style. They are determined to improve their work in the future. In 1958, they not only require that all the double-wheeled double-share plows that had been returned be promoted again, but also that they be fully utilized during spring plowing, giving full play to the role each double-wheeled double-share plow should have, making it one of the key factors in striving for a bumper harvest this year. The county committee plans to immediately take the following measures:

　　First, mobilize cadres and the masses from top to bottom, and while summarizing the experiences and lessons of production, also summarize the experiences and lessons of using the double-wheeled double-share plow. Educate all Party members and cadres to understand the great significance of carrying out agricultural technical revolution and the attitude they should adopt, and quickly launch a massive mass technical revolution movement.

　　Second, the county committee plans to convene a forum of advanced units in the county that have successfully used the double-share plow to summarize existing advanced experiences and widely disseminate and promote them. At the same time, it has been decided to organize an agricultural study tour delegation in early February to visit Huangyan County to learn the operating techniques of the double-wheeled double-share plow and the experience of achieving significant yield increases using the double-wheeled double-share plow. It also plans to hold two agricultural technical training classes throughout the county before and after the Spring Festival to train a group of agricultural technicians and new-style farm implement operators to solve the operational technical problems of the double-wheeled double-share plow.

　　Third, earnestly solve various practical difficulties in the promotion process. Organize all relevant departments to actively support cooperatives in adopting double-wheeled double-share plows and other new-style farm implements in all aspects.

　　接受批评　立即改正
    鄞县决定发挥双铧犁的作用
    本报讯  浙江日报消息：中共鄞县县委看到报纸上批评他们对推广双轮双铧犁工作放松领导的消息后，已经从领导思想和作风上作了初步检查，决心改进今后的工作。1958年不仅要求把已经退回的全部双轮双铧犁重新推广下去，而且在春耕生产中全部使用起来，发挥每部双轮双铧犁应有的作用，使之成为争取今年大丰收的重要关键之一。县委打算立即采取以下几个措施：
    第一，自上而下发动干部和群众，在总结生产经验教训的同时，总结使用双轮双铧犁的经验教训，教育全体党员、干部明确实行农业技术革命的重大意义和应抱的态度，迅速掀起一个规模巨大的群众性的技术革命运动。
    第二，县委准备召开本县使用双铧犁成功的先进单位的座谈会，总结现有的先进经验，广泛传布、推广。同时决定于2月初组织农业参观访问代表团去黄岩县参观学习双轮双铧犁的操作技术和使用双轮双铧犁获得显著增产的经验。并打算在春节前后全县举办二期农业技术训练班，训练一批农业技术员和新式农具手，解决双轮双铧犁的操作技术问题。
    第三，认真解决推广当中的各种实际困难。组织各有关部门从各方面积极支援合作社采用双轮双铧犁和其他新式农具。
