　　I fully agree with the reports of Vice Chairman Peng, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, and Director Wu.

　　I am from Minqin County, Gansu Province. I will report to all representatives the situation of our county's struggle against wind and sand in the past few years.

　　In the Past, the West Wind Killed the Seedlings, and the East Wind Dried Up the Fields; Now, We Enclose Sand to Cultivate Seedlings, and Grain and Cotton Production Increases Year After Year

　　Our Minqin County is in Zhangye Prefecture, which is in the northern part of the Hexi Corridor, close to the Mongolian Desert. The wind and sand are very severe. Villages and farmland are surrounded by layers of sand dunes. When the wind blows, the yellow sand covers the sky, and crops are greatly damaged. "Sand dunes压庄园 (yā zhuāngyuán, compress the villages), flowing sand buries farmland, the west wind kills the seedlings, and the east wind dries up the fields." Take our Xuebai Agricultural Cooperative as an example. In the past thirty years, five villages have been buried by flowing sand, and more than four thousand mu of the six thousand mu of cultivated land cannot be cultivated because they are covered by flowing sand. Grain yield was very low, only about one hundred jin per mu, and we were short of food and clothing every year, and life was very hard. At that time, the masses called the wind and sand "Yellow Dragon" and believed that it was destined for whoever it fell on. After liberation, with the leadership of the Party, people really turned over, and the land also turned over. Since 1951, our county has called for "planting trees and creating forests to prevent wind and fix sand." At the beginning, the masses had no confidence in afforestation and sand control, saying, "The more the Yellow Dragon is suppressed, the poorer we become," and "It's useless to work hard for afforestation, what's the point?" Later, the state-owned forest farm successfully conducted afforestation and seedling cultivation experiments in the desert, which opened up the minds of the masses. Especially after cooperativization, Chairman Mao put forward the call to green the motherland, and the movement became even more heated. In the past few years, the county has afforested more than 280,000 mu, suppressed more than 2,600 mu of sand dunes, enclosed more than 400,000 mu of sand to cultivate seedlings, and the windbreaks that have been planted and supplemented are 1,700 *li* long if calculated according to length. In this way, the flowing sand is basically blocked, and many lands that were covered by sand in the past have been taken back. The cultivated land of our cooperative has now increased to more than 6,900 mu. The grain yield per mu was more than 260 jin in 1956. Last year, it suffered some drought, but it still yielded more than 200 jin, which is double the previous yield. Every family has enough to eat and use, and there is surplus grain to sell to the state. In 1956, the county test-planted 100,000 mu of cotton, with an average yield of more than 30 jin per mu, and the highest reached 140 jin. The 900 mu planted by our cooperative yielded an average of 37 jin per mu. The trees have also begun to generate income, and firewood and forage are not as difficult as in the past. Because trees were planted on both sides of the canals, reducing seepage, more land was irrigated. Now, the masses understand the benefits of "planting trees and creating forests to prevent wind and fix sand." Some elderly people said, "If we had known to do this earlier, we would have suffered fewer years of hardship." But without the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, how could we have done it!

　　Continue to Increase Grain Production and Develop "Three Flowers" - The Hexi Corridor Should Be Built into a Grain and Cotton Base

　　After the great debate on the two roads last year, the enthusiasm of the masses in our Minqin County became even greater. This year, the county will afforest 152,000 mu, cultivate 8,500 mu of seedlings, collect 450,000 jin of seeds, enclose 40,000 mu of sand to cultivate seedlings, suppress 30,000 mu of sand dunes, supplement and insert 2,000 *li* of windbreaks, and plant 8,000 mu of fruit trees, including 2,000 mu of grapes, and plant 250,000 mu of cotton. Our cooperative plans to produce 360 jin of grain per mu and 60 jin of cotton per mu this year. During the Second Five-Year Plan, in addition to increasing grain production, our Minqin County will also strive to develop "three flowers," namely cotton, flowers and fruits, and peanuts. In the past, there was an old saying in our area: "If you want to eat wild grain, collect 沙米(shā mǐ, sand rice); if you want to eat meat, hunt 沙鸡(shā jī, sand chicken); if you want to eat vegetables, grab 沙葱(shā cōng, sand onion); if you want to eat autumn vegetables, pull 沙芥(shā jiè, sand mustard); if you want to eat fruits, pick 沙枣(shā zǎo, sand dates)." At that time, everyone was so poor that they had no choice but to try to make a little money in the desert. Now, this situation has changed greatly. In the future, more grain will be produced, the "three flowers" will be developed, and the number of pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks will increase. The lives of the masses will be better, and no one will look for the "five sands" anymore.

　　Our Zhangye Prefecture is being built into a grain and cotton base, and has already put forward the slogan of "crossing the Yellow River in five years and surpassing the Yangtze River in ten years." We also want to build a large sand prevention forest belt along the edge of the desert from Jingtai County to Dunhuang County, which is 3,000 *li* long and 3 *li* wide. In the past, Qin Shi Huang used bricks and stones to build a gray Great Wall. Today, we want to build a green Great Wall with trees. This is a great undertaking that our ancestors have never done before. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to do it. In the near future, our Hexi Corridor will definitely be free from wind disasters, sand will not move south, the Gobi will become an oasis, and the desert will become fertile land. The people of our Minqin County are determined to strive to achieve this goal.

### 我们要造一条绿色长城  薛万祥代表介绍民勤县群众同风沙的英勇斗争

　　我们要造一条绿色长城
    薛万祥代表介绍民勤县群众同风沙的英勇斗争
    彭副委员长、李副总理、薄副总理、吴主任的报告，我都完全同意。
    我是甘肃省民勤县人。我把我们县上几年来同风沙作斗争的情况，向各位代表汇报一下。
　　过去西风打死苗东风吹干田  现在封沙育苗粮棉年年增产
    我们民勤县在张掖专区，也就是河西走廊的北部，紧靠蒙古沙漠。风沙很厉害，村庄、农田都被层层沙丘包围住，风刮起来，黄沙遮天，庄稼受到很大损害。“沙丘压庄园，流沙埋农田，西风打死苗，东风吹干田”。拿我们薛百农业社来说，三十年来有五个庄子给流沙埋掉，六千多亩耕地有四千多亩被流沙盖住不能耕种。粮食产量很低，每亩只打粮食一百斤左右，年年少吃缺穿，生活苦得很。那时候，群众把风沙叫作“黄龙”，认为落到谁家都是命里注定。解放后，有了党的领导，真是人翻了身，地也翻了身。从一九五一年起，我们县上就号召“植树造林，防风固沙”。开始的时候，群众对造林压沙没有信心，说是“黄龙黄龙，愈压愈穷”，又说“造林白受苦，有啥来头呢”？后来国营林场在沙漠上造林育苗试验成功了，才打通了群众的思想。特别是合作化以后，毛主席提出绿化祖国的号召，运动就更加热火地搞起来了。几年来，全县造林二十八万多亩，压沙丘二千六百多亩，封沙育苗四十多万亩，插补的风墙，要按长短算起来，就有一千七百多华里。这样，就把流沙基本上挡住了，并且把许多过去被沙子盖住的地夺了回来。我们社的耕地，现在已经增加到六千九百多亩。每亩打的粮食，一九五六年是二百六十多斤，去年受了些旱，但是还打了二百零几斤，比过去增加了一倍，家家够吃够用，还有余粮卖给国家。一九五六年全县试种了十万亩棉花，每亩平均收棉花三十多斤，最高的达到一百四十斤。我们社种的九百亩，每亩平均产三十七斤。林木也开始有了收益，烧柴、饲草也不像过去那样困难了。因为渠道两旁种了树，减少了渗漏，就多浇了地。现在，群众都明白了“植树造林，防风固沙”的好处，有的老年人说：“早知道这样搞，少受多少年苦。”但是，要没有党和毛主席的领导，那里能办得到呢！
　　继续增产粮食并发展“三花”  河西走廊要建设成粮棉基地
    去年经过两条道路大辩论以后，我们民勤县群众的劲头更大了。今年全县要造林十五万二千亩，育苗八千五百亩，采种四十五万斤，封沙育苗四万亩，压沙丘三万亩，补插风墙二千华里，种果树八千亩，包括二千亩葡萄，种棉花二十五万亩。我们社计划今年每亩打粮食三百六十斤，每亩收棉花六十斤。在第二个五年计划内，我们民勤县除了增产粮食，还要努力发展“三花”，就是棉花、花果、花生。从前我们那里有句老话：“要吃野粮打沙米，要吃荤的打沙鸡，要吃菜蔬抓沙葱，要吃秋菜拔沙芥，要吃果子采沙枣。”那时候大家穷得没有办法，只好到沙漠里去打一点小主意。现在，这种情况已经有了很大变化。今后，粮食打的更多了，“三花”发展了，猪羊鸡鸭增加了，群众生活更好了，谁也不会再去找“五沙”了。
    我们张掖专区正在建设成为一个粮棉基地，已经提出“五年跨黄河，十年过长江”的口号。我们还要从景泰县到敦煌县沿沙漠边上，造一条长三千华里，宽三华里的防沙大林带。过去，秦始皇用砖石造了一条灰色的长城，今天，我们要用树木造一条绿色的长城。这是我们先人从来没有做过的伟大事业。在党和毛主席的领导下，我们一定能够办到。不久以后，我们河西走廊一定是风不成灾，沙不南移，戈壁变绿洲，沙漠成良田。我们民勤县人民坚决要为实现这个目标而奋斗。
