Xinhua News Agency, 14th. Forty state-operated art troupes from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, Chongqing and other places jointly issued a proposal at the National Art Performance Troupes Work Conference that concluded on the 14th, hoping that art troupes across the country would stir up revolutionary vigor, achieve and strive for self-sufficiency, and make an all-round great leap forward in ideology, art, and economy.

The proposal pointed out that these forty art performance troupes have decided to achieve self-sufficiency in 1958, without requiring state subsidies, and further strive to have a surplus. The proposal also stated: "We will resolutely overcome bourgeois ideological styles and all phenomena of extravagance and waste, implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, serving workers, peasants and soldiers with literature and art, and 'letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new,' enrich the repertoire, strengthen artistic practice, constantly improve the quality of performances, bring art to factories and rural areas, meet the growing cultural needs of the people, and coordinate and support national socialist construction."

In the proposal, these state-operated troupes proposed to learn from fraternal troupes that have already achieved self-sufficiency, and suggested that fraternal troupes that are still receiving state subsidies should stir up revolutionary vigor, vigorously increase production and practice economy, achieve self-sufficiency immediately if conditions permit, and achieve self-sufficiency in as short a time as possible if they cannot. Just as workers and peasants are making a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a great leap forward should also be made in artistic work.

Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, spoke before the end of the meeting. Liu Zhiming said that the anti-waste movement in art troupes shows that it is necessary and possible to put forward the policy-oriented slogan of "running troupes diligently and thriftily, achieving self-sufficiency, and striving for a surplus" in the economy. This is the inevitable path for socialist art undertakings in the economy. The realization of this management principle can ensure that art troupes better serve workers, peasants and soldiers and socialism, prosper socialist national new literature and art, and constantly improve artistic quality.

Liu Zhiming said that achieving self-sufficiency is a revolution for many state-operated art troupes. According to existing experience, in order to achieve self-sufficiency, art performance troupes must face workers, peasants and soldiers, perform in factories and rural areas, increase the number of performances, and improve the quality of performances; rationally arrange and save manpower and material resources, so that people can make the best use of their talents and materials can be used to their full potential; save business and administrative expenses; and also establish a series of socialist management systems in terms of arranging repertoire, organizing audiences, and using manpower. That is to say, we must both increase production and save; we must both have new ideas and have a new set of systems to guarantee them. In terms of repertoire, we should first pay attention to selecting and performing programs that reflect the real life and struggles of workers, peasants and soldiers, but we should also continue to explore, sort out, and perform traditional repertoire.

Liu Zhiming said that politics, art, and economy are interrelated and should not be neglected. In the future, everyone must vigorously practice economy, achieve self-sufficiency, and strive for a surplus, and also perform more plays and perform good plays; it is absolutely not permissible to neglect politics and develop towards capitalist commercialization in order to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Liu Zhiming said that all art performance troupes should actively find ways to increase income and save expenses, and prevent possible deviations such as attempting to lower the average wage income level of actors and staff, inappropriately raising ticket prices, only pursuing the number of performances and neglecting the quality of performances, and neglecting the physical health of actors.

Liu Zhiming said that at present, on the production front and the cultural and educational front, one leap forward is followed by another, and people's revolutionary enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. By carrying forward this socialist revolutionary enthusiasm and removing the extravagance, bureaucracy, lifelessness, arrogance, and squeamishness in the cultural and art departments, we will surely be able to promote a new prosperity in the socialist literary and art cause and more deeply implement the policy of serving workers, peasants and soldiers with literature and art. Liu Zhiming hoped that cultural administrative departments and art troupes would organize professional and amateur writers to vigorously prosper creation, and he also hoped that literary and art workers would correctly handle the relationship between the popularization and improvement of literature and art, recognize the important significance of popularization work, and actively guide mass amateur cultural activities.

Liu Zhiming also talked about the issue of strengthening political and ideological work in art troupes. He pointed out that strengthening political and ideological leadership is the fundamental guarantee for realizing a comprehensive great leap forward in ideology, art, and economy. Business work and political work should be well combined and should not be opposed to each other. Actors and staff should participate in labor training in various ways and strengthen political study to transform and improve themselves.

This meeting was a meeting to promote a great leap forward in artistic work, a great improvement in artistic quality, and a great change in artistic style. During the meeting, representatives of art troupes from various regions responded to the call of the Ministry of Culture to "run troupes diligently and thriftily, achieve self-sufficiency, and strive for a surplus," and revised their own troupes' great leap forward plans again and again. Some troupes that have already achieved self-sufficiency, such as the Chengdu Sichuan Opera Troupe and the Tianjin Yue Opera Troupe, also introduced their experiences.

### 克服资产阶级思想作风和铺张浪费现象  在经济上自给　在艺术上丰收  各地四十个国营艺术团体提出革命倡议

    克服资产阶级思想作风和铺张浪费现象
    在经济上自给　在艺术上丰收
    各地四十个国营艺术团体提出革命倡议
    新华社14日讯　北京、上海、广州、武汉、西安、重庆等地的四十个国营艺术团体在14日结束的全国艺术表演团体工作会议上联合发出倡议书，希望全国艺术团体鼓起革命干劲、实现和争取自给，在思想上、艺术上、经济上来个全面的大跃进。
    倡议书指出，这四十个艺术表演团体决定在1958年内做到自给自足，不要国家补贴，进而争取有所盈余。倡议书还写道：“我们将坚决克服资产阶级思想作风和一切铺张浪费现象，贯彻勤俭办企业，文艺为工农兵服务和‘百花齐放，推陈出新’的方针，丰富上演剧目，加强艺术实践，不断提高演出质量，把艺术送到工厂、农村，满足人民日益增长的文化要求，配合和支援国家社会主义建设”。
    这些国营剧团在倡议书中提出，要向已经实现自给的兄弟剧团学习，并建议目前仍然领取国家补助的兄弟剧团鼓起革命干劲，厉行增产节约，有条件自给的立即自给，不能自给的要在尽可能短的时间内做到自给。像工人农民使工农业生产大跃进一样，在艺术工作上也来个大跃进。
    文化部副部长刘芝明在会议结束以前讲了话。刘芝明说，艺术团体中的反浪费运动说明，在经济上有必要和可能提出“勤俭办团，自给自足，争取盈余”这个带方针性的口号。这是社会主义艺术事业在经济上的必由之路。实现这一经营管理原则，就可以保证艺术团体更好地为工农兵、为社会主义服务，繁荣社会主义的民族的新文艺，并能不断提高艺术质量。
    刘芝明说，实现自给自足，对于不少国营艺术团体来说，是一个革命。根据已有的经验，艺术表演团体实现自给自足，就要作到面向工农兵，下厂下乡演出，增加演出场次，提高演出质量；合理安排和节约人力、物力，使人尽其才，物尽其用；节约业务和行政的开支；还要在安排剧目、组织观众、人力使用等方面建立一系列的社会主义的经营管理制度。就是说，既要增产，又要节约；既要有新的思想，又要有一套新的制度来保证。在剧目方面，首先应该注意选演反映工农兵现实生活和斗争的节目，但也要继续发掘、整理和演出传统剧目。
    刘芝明说，政治、艺术、经济三者是互相联系的，不可偏废。今后大家既要厉行节约，自给自足，争取盈余，又要多演戏、演好戏；绝不可以为了实现经济上自给而忽视政治，向资本主义的商业化道路发展。刘芝明说，各艺术表演团体，应当从积极方面设法增加收入，节约开支，要防止企图降低演员和职员平均工资收入水平、不适当地提高票价、只追求演出场数而忽视演出质量、忽视演员身体健康等可能产生的偏向。
    刘芝明说，目前生产战线和文教战线上，一个跃进接着一个跃进，人们的革命干劲空前高涨，发扬这种社会主义的革命干劲，去掉文化艺术部门中的阔气、官气、暮气、骄气和娇气，就一定能促进社会主义文艺事业的新的繁荣，更深入地贯彻文艺为工农兵服务的方针。刘芝明希望文化行政部门和艺术团体组织专业和业余作者大力繁荣创作，他还希望文艺工作者正确处理文艺的普及和提高的关系，认识普及工作的重要意义，积极辅导群众业余文化活动。
    刘芝明还谈到了艺术团体加强政治思想工作的问题。他指出，加强政治思想领导，是实现思想、艺术、经济上全面大跃进的根本保证。业务工作同政治工作应该很好结合而不应该互相对立。演员职员都应当通过各种方式参加劳动锻炼，加强政治学习，以改造和提高自己。
    这次会议是一次促进艺术工作大跃进、艺术质量大提高、艺术作风大转变的会议。会议期间，各地艺术团体代表响应了文化部关于“勤俭办团，自给自足、争取盈余”的号召，一次又一次地修订了自己团体大跃进的计划。一些已经实现自给的剧团如成都市川剧团、天津越剧团等还介绍了经验。
