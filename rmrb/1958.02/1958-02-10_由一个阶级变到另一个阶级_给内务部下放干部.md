　　“Transforming from One Class to Another”
　　—To the Cadres Being Sent Down from the Ministry of Internal Affairs
　　Xie Juezai

　　You are about to go to the countryside with joy and start an extraordinary life of labor and training.

　　The process of labor training is, as Chairman Mao said in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, "a process in which feelings change, from one class to another." Therefore, you must be mentally prepared, clean your minds, and welcome new things. If some people are outwardly happy to be sent down, but still have thoughts like "What is there to learn from farmers?", "It's a waste of talent for intellectuals to be farmers," or "Rural life is hard" lingering in their minds, then it will hinder your training.

　　I would like to talk about these issues below.

　　Is there "nothing to learn from farmers"? Chairman Mao said in his report on rectification in 1942: "They should know a truth, that many so-called intellectuals are actually the most ignorant comparatively, and workers and peasants sometimes have more knowledge than them." This "more" is exactly what intellectuals must learn. Chairman Mao also said that to become intellectuals worthy of the name, "the only way is to make them participate in practical work and become practical workers," that is, to go to labor, to go to grassroots work, and become practical laborers and grassroots workers.

　　I grew up in the countryside. Decades ago, when I was very young, I heard the word "zuojia" (作家), not referring to "writers" of literary works, but to "zuojia" who cultivated the land. Some old people often praised someone as a "zuojia", worthy of the name "tian xiucai" (田秀才, a farmer with some learning). When I played outside with some farm children older than me who studied with me in private school, they told me: this is what kind of grass, that is what kind of tree, this is what kind of grain, that is what kind of vegetable, the fruit of a certain tree can be eaten, and there are loach and fish in a certain ditch. I knew more characters than them, but in this respect, I was "shorter." I often went with an old man who worked at my house to grow vegetables, chop firewood, raise fish, raise pigs, cook, and stir-fry dishes. He was proficient in everything, and it was always right to do as he said.

　　I have some farming knowledge, which I learned at that time, and I developed some feelings for the countryside at that time as well. Unfortunately, after I went from elementary school to classical school, I became estranged from this aspect, and gradually became an intellectual who was "physically weak and unable to distinguish the five grains."

　　The countryside is a sea of knowledge. After land reform and cooperativization, there is not only old production knowledge but also new production knowledge; there are not only small "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountain" stories (see the New Observer's New Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountain in the January issue), but also large-scale miracles of turning high mountains into paddy fields and low-lying areas into fertile land. There is not nothing to learn there, but it is impossible to learn everything and difficult to learn thoroughly.

　　It should be pointed out that there are currently no complete textbooks and no pretentious teachers there. If you want to learn, you must be, as Chairman Mao said: "It is essential for me to be respectful, diligent, and adopt a comradely attitude when I am their student, otherwise they will ignore me, know but not speak, or not speak completely. … Without full enthusiasm, without the determination to look downwards, without the desire for knowledge, without putting down the stinking airs and being willing to be a primary school student, it is definitely impossible to do, and it is definitely impossible to do well." ("Preface to 'Rural Survey'")

　　Of course, the peasants also need your knowledge very much. Your knowledge—culture and technology—after participating in labor and combining with practice, that is, making the peasants' knowledge systematic and elevated to theory, and your knowledge is also tested by practice rather than empty talk. Then it will be possible to develop the rural production cause from the existing foundation by leaps and bounds. Only by first being students of the masses can we become teachers of the masses. This truth will be gradually understood in your labor training.

　　As mentioned above, then, "Is it a waste of talent for intellectuals to be farmers?" The answer should be: Not going down to participate in rural labor is a waste. I have seen many intellectuals like me in the old society. Generally, they become local tyrants, evil gentry, corrupt officials, or petty functionaries of varying sizes, urinating on the heads of the people; the more clumsy ones, unable to carry or lift anything, muddle-headed, bumping into things, become useless. Such "talents" are a scourge to the people, but unfortunately there is no way to "waste" them! A small number of intellectuals with ambition and real talent and learning have done many good things for the people, especially the revolutionary intellectuals who have contributed to the cause of the people's liberation, who are even more worthy of admiration. But their general shortcoming is that they have not participated in labor or have little practical struggle experience, so some of them are always distant from the working people, and in a society that has entered socialist construction and wants to completely eliminate exploitation and eliminate individualism, they often show wavering. The only way to save this wavering is ideological transformation, especially engaging in labor training to achieve transformation. Only in this way can these talents give full play to their strengths without being "wasted."

　　Regarding the question of whether rural life is hard, it depends on how we look at it. The correct view: First, my country's economy is backward, and the standard of living is very low. Although it has improved somewhat in recent years, generally speaking, whether in cities or in the countryside, life is not very prosperous. Second, although rural life is currently somewhat inferior to urban life, in the national economic construction plan, on the one hand, the Agricultural Development Program (revised draft) is being promoted to greatly change the face of the countryside in a very short period of time. On the other hand, the balanced supply of materials between cities and the countryside and the slow increase in the wages of workers and staff will eliminate the feeling of difference in urban and rural life as the standard of living gradually increases with the development of production. Third, the phenomenon of hardship is comparative. We should not build our own lack of hardship on the hardship of others. On the contrary, we should endure hardship before others and enjoy after others. Chairman Mao called on all state workers, economic workers, and especially responsible workers in all aspects, at the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, to advocate the style of hard work and plain living and to share weal and woe with the masses. That is to say, first we must suffer hardships like the masses, and then we have the right to enjoy the sweetness created together with the masses. And cadres should not have the concept of fearing hardship and caring about hardship or not. Fourth, the current rural life is already very different from before, and it is improving faster and faster.

　　Since you already have the determination to not be afraid of hardship, then "hardship" will naturally disappear in front of you. If you chat with the old people in the countryside, they will tell you that they never thought they would live such a good life in their old age. Then, you will also feel happy in the same way.

　　Next, let’s talk about the place you are going to—Fu County. Fu County has paddy fields, plateau land, slope land, trees, and rivers. Comrade Lin Boqu inspected Zhangcunyi (i.e., the place you are going to) in 1941 and wrote a poem:

　　The Hulu River flows long and clear,
　　There are many sceneries like the south of the Yangtze River on the border.
　　I would like to follow Li Bing's example in building water conservancy, [Note]
　　So that mulberry and hemp cover thousands of acres, along with fine grain.

　　I have also been to Fu County. It was in the severe winter, and there were still children catching fish in the ditches in Zhangcunyi Heishisi and other places. There are many places in the Hulu River where it can be repaired. The two mountains stand opposite each other, and building a dam does not require a large project or government investment, and more rice can be planted. Most of the people there are immigrants from other provinces, mostly from Sichuan and Shandong, and the paddy fields are mostly made by people from Sichuan.

　　Du Fu, the saint of poetry more than a thousand years ago, lived in Fu County. He moved his family here during the war. If you have read Du Fu's "Moonlit Night":

　　Tonight the moon shines on Fu Prefecture,
　　In her chamber, my wife watches it alone.
　　I pity my little children from afar,
　　Who don't understand longing for Chang'an.
　　…This is missing home. "Qiang Village":

　　Towering red clouds in the west, the sun sets on the plain.
　　A bird chatters at the rustic gate, a traveler returns from a thousand miles.
　　My wife and children wonder who I am, they are startled and wipe away their tears.
　　…This is returning home. Qiang Village is in Fu County, and it is said that there are still ruins. Then you will think of how good it would be to bring your family to settle down and build a socialist Fu County together, and "watch together" the moon of Fu Prefecture instead of "watching alone"!

　　The words must be made clear:

　　The state has great expectations for the cadres who are sent down. It wants you to be the backbone of socialist construction and consolidation. It is not that it does not need you to come back. The cadres who have not been sent down are waiting for you to come back before they are sent down. Now, we are not suffering from too many people, but from people of insufficient quality, who cannot adapt to the needs of the broad masses' construction enthusiasm and cause. Work can change thinking. It is possible that you will not want to return to the original organs after one or two years of production in the countryside. They need you there, and you love it there, and you don't want to come back. But at that time, your concept of obeying the organization will be stronger, and you will go wherever you are asked to go.

　　Dear comrades! You are leaving tomorrow. Embrace the joy and the expectations of the Party and the government for you, and let it blossom in your body and spirit in the process of labor, train to be strong and solid, and truly "transform from one class to another." At the same time, you will also become socialist flowers, and together with the workers and peasants, build our glorious and brilliant motherland with modern industry and modern agriculture by leaps and bounds. I wish
　　You victory and health.
　　January 31st

### “由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”——给内务部下放干部

　　“由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”
　　——给内务部下放干部
　　谢觉哉
    你们即将欢天喜地地去农村，开始劳动锻炼的不平凡的生活。
    劳动锻炼的过程，是如毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中说的：“这就叫做感情起了变化，由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”的过程。因此，必须有精神准备，把脑子打扫干净，迎接新的东西。如果有的人表面高兴下放，而脑子里还残存着“向农民有甚么可学？”，“知识分子当农民是人才浪费”，“农村生活苦”等念头，那就将妨碍你们的锻炼。
    下面想谈谈这些问题。
    “向农民没有可学”吗？毛主席1942年在整风的报告中说：“他们应该知道一个真理，就是许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的，工农分子的知识有时倒比他们多一点”。多的这一点，恰恰是知识分子所必须学的。毛主席又说，要变为名副其实的知识分子，“唯一的办法就是使他们参加到实际工作中去，变为实际工作者”，就是说，到劳动中去，到基层工作中去，变为实际劳动者和基层工作者。
    我是生长农村的。几十年前我还很小的时候就听到“作家”二字，不是指写文艺作品的“作家”而是指耕作田地的作家。一些老人们常常称赞某某是“作家”，够得上“田秀才”。和我在私塾读书的一些年龄比我大的农家孩子，同他们出外玩，他们告诉我：这是甚么草，那是甚么树，这是甚么禾，那是甚么菜，某种树的果子可吃，某处沟里有黄鳝有鱼。我认的字比他们多，但在这方面，我就“矮”了。我常同一位在我家做活的老头去种菜、砍柴、养鱼、养猪、煮饭、炒菜，他样样在行，照他的话做准没错。
    我有一点子农家知识，是那时候学的，对农村有点感情，也是那时候起的。可惜我由蒙馆进了经馆就和这方面疏远了，逐渐成为一个“四体不勤，五谷不分”的知识分子。
    农村是知识海。在土地改革和合作化以后，不只有旧的生产知识而且有了新的生产知识；不只有狭小的“愚公移山”事迹（看新观察一月号新愚公移山记），而且有规模宏大的把高山变水田、洼地变良田的奇事。那里不是没有可学而是无法学完、不易学透。
    需要指出的，那里现尚无成套的教科书、没有装模作样的教师，你要学，就要像毛主席说的：“我给他们当学生是必须恭谨勤劳和采取同志态度的，否则他们就不理我，知而不言，言而不尽。……没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的”。（“‘农村调查’序言”）
    自然，你们的知识，农民也很需要。你们的知识——文化与技术，经过参加劳动，与实际结合起来，即是说，使农民的知识成为有系统的提高到理论，你们的知识，也得到实际的考验而不是空谈。那就能够把农村的生产事业，从现有的基础上飞跃地发展起来。先做群众的学生，才能做群众的先生，这一真理在你们劳动锻炼中将逐渐体会到的。
    如上所述，那末，“知识分子当农民是不是人才浪费？”答复应该是：不下放参加农村劳动，才是浪费。旧社会的知识分子像我这样的人，我见到很多了。一般是成为或大或小的土豪劣绅贪官污吏，骑在人民头上洒尿；较呆笨的人，肩不能挑、手不能提、昏头昏脑、东碰西钻，成为废物。这样的“人才”，是人民的祸害，可惜没法子把他们“浪费”掉！一小部分有志气、有真才实学的知识分子，他们替人民做了很多好事，特别是为人民解放事业出了力的革命知识分子，更值得敬佩。但他们一般的缺点是没有参加过劳动或者也少有实际斗争经验，因而他们中某些人总和劳动人民有距离，在社会已经进入社会主义建设、要彻底消灭剥削消灭个人主义的时期，他们常常表示动摇。挽救这种动摇，唯一的方法是思想改造，尤其从事劳动锻炼以达到改造。只有这样，这些人才才能发挥其长而不至于被“浪费”。
    关于农村生活是不是苦的问题，决定于我们怎样看。正确的看法：第一、我国经济落后，生活程度很低，几年来虽有所改善，但一般说来，不论城市或农村，生活都是不甚优裕的。第二、农村的生活虽然目前有些不及城市，但国家在经济建设的计划中，一方面推行农业发展纲要（修正草案），要在很短期间大大的改变农村的面貌，另一方面城市与农村的物资平衡供应，职工的工资缓慢增加，在逐步的生产发展生活水平提高的过程中，将消灭人们的城乡生活的差别之感。第三、苦不苦的现象，是比较来的，我们不应该把自己的不苦建立在别人苦的上面，相反，应该吃苦在人之先，享受在人之后。毛主席在党的八届二中全会上号召全体国家工作人员、经济工作人员首先是各方面的负责工作人员，提倡艰苦朴素的作风，与群众同甘共苦。就是说，先要同群众一样吃苦，然后才有权享受和群众一起创造出来的甘。而在干部的脑子里则不应有怕苦和计较苦与不苦的概念。第四、现在农村生活已经比以前大大不同，而且越来越改善得快。
    你们已经有不怕苦的决心，自然“苦”就在你们面前消失了。你们如果和农村里的老人们闲谈，他们将告诉你想不到老来还过到这样美好的日子，那末，你们也将同样感到欢喜了。
    后面，谈谈你们要去的地方——鄜县，鄜县有水田、有塬地、有坡地、有树有河，林伯渠同志1941年视察张村驿（即你们要去的地方）写过一首诗：
    长流清澈葫芦河，
    塞上江南风景多。
    愿效李冰兴水利，〔注〕
    桑麻万顷并嘉禾。
    我也去过鄜县，那是严冬时候，张村驿黑水寺等处，还有小孩在沟里捉鱼。葫芦河有好多处可以修，两山夹峙，修筑水坝，工程不大，不需政府投资，就可以种更多的水稻。那里的人民多是外省迁去的，四川、山东人为多，水田多是四川人做的。
    一千多年前的诗圣杜甫在鄜县住过。他是在战争时候把家眷迁送到这里的。你们如读过杜甫的月夜：
    今夜鄜州月，闺中只独看。
    遥怜小儿女，未解忆长安。
　　…………这是想家。羌村：
    峥嵘赤云西，日脚下平地。
    柴门雀鸟噪，归客千里至。
    妻孥怪我在，惊定还拭泪。
　　…………
    这是还家。羌村在鄜县，听说还有遗址。那你们就会想起如把家属接去安家，共同建设社会主义的鄜县，“同看”鄜州月而不是“独看”，会多么的好！
    话得交代明白：
    国家对于下放干部期望很大，要你们作为社会主义建设与巩固的中坚，不是不需要你们回来。未下放的干部等待你们回来后再下放。现在不是患人多而是患人的质量不高，不能适应广大人民建设热潮与事业的需要。工作可以使思想发生变化，可能你在农村生产一二年不愿回原机关了。那里需要你们，你们也喜爱那里，不想回来了。不过到那时，你们服从组织的观念会更强，要你去那里你就会去那里的。
    亲爱的同志们！你们明日就要出发了。抱着喜悦的心情和党和政府对你们的期望，它要在劳动的过程中在你们的身体上精神上开花，锻炼得坚强、结实，真正地“由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”。同时你们也就成为社会主义之花，和工农劳动大众一道，飞跃地建设起光辉灿烂有现代工业和现代农业的我们的祖国。祝
    你们胜利、健康。
                一月三十一日
