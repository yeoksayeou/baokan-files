　　In a few days, the Spring Festival, a traditional and important holiday for the Chinese people, will arrive. On the eve of the Spring Festival, a magnificent new high tide of socialist construction unfolds before us, presenting a moving scene. From the shores of the East China Sea to the Pamir Plateau, from the Heilongjiang River to the Wuzhi Mountain, in every corner of our beloved motherland, spanning thousands of miles, an unprecedented revolutionary zeal is surging. More than twenty million workers are working intensely in workshops, mines, construction sites, transportation lines, shops, laboratories, classrooms, and offices, with reports of increased production and advanced innovations coming one after another. Hundreds of millions of peasant brothers are launching new offensives against nature, and a massive water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaign is underway. Hundreds of millions of people are fighting day and night on water conservancy construction sites to make mountains bow their heads and rivers give way. In four months, the country has opened up more than 117 million mu of irrigated area, which is equal to half of the irrigated area opened up in the past four thousand years. After our people proudly overfulfilled the first Five-Year Plan for national economic construction, our second Five-Year Plan has had such a wonderful beginning. How can this not make the people of the whole country more energetic and confident!
　　It is precisely at this inspiring moment that the Spring Festival, a traditional holiday for the Chinese people, arrives. "Every holiday season, one thinks of one's loved ones." Many workers want to use the Spring Festival holiday to go home, reunite with their relatives, and offer them New Year's greetings and good news. This is very natural. Many workers can't resist the attraction of the magnificent scene of enthusiastic production in the countryside and are eager to go back to see the new face of their hometown. This is also very natural.
　　However, now we want to discuss this issue with the worker comrades. First, let's ask everyone to recall the past: In the past few years, around the Spring Festival, there was always a situation of more or less reduced attendance rates in production enterprises and serious congestion in transportation, and this has been considered a "norm." This "norm" not only brought considerable losses to the cause of production and construction but also brought more disadvantages than advantages to the workers themselves. Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: "Norms" are not inviolable. Revolutionaries should not unconditionally regard all "norms" as golden rules and worship them as Buddhas. If they hinder the development of the cause of socialist construction, they must be ruthlessly broken. So, what attitude should we take towards the "norm" of previous years around the Spring Festival? Is it necessary to break it? Is it possible to break it? The answers should all be affirmative.
　　As mentioned earlier, our country is currently in a new high tide of socialist construction, and various movements and tasks in enterprises and government agencies, such as production, work, rectification, anti-waste, and eliminating the "four pests," are very intense. The broad masses of workers are participating in these movements with high enthusiasm. The whole year's work depends on a good start in spring, and every inch of time is worth an inch of gold. Our time is extremely precious. In order to accelerate the change of our country's backward situation of being both poor and blank, and to achieve the great goal of "catching up with or surpassing Britain in the production of steel and other important products in fifteen years or a little more," we must be good at seizing time, cherish every minute and every second, and strive to use every minute and every second for production and construction. We must muster revolutionary zeal, think of all possible ways to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically, and strive for the upstream in order to catch up.
　　In this situation, what every worker should consider first is not the issue of going home, but how to keep production rising continuously. If we do not break the "norm" and become prisoners of the "norm," and everyone squeezes to go home during the Spring Festival, wouldn't this be very unfavorable to the cause of national construction? In these days of racing against time, we must make the arrow of increased production rise in a straight line and leap forward. If too many workers go home during the Spring Festival and the attendance rate cannot be guaranteed, the arrow of increased production will inevitably fall back. This is not only a disgrace to the workers of our country but will also have a negative impact on the cause of national construction. China's socialist economy is developing in a planned and proportionate way. If one department or one link falls behind, it will hold back other departments and other links, hindering local construction, or even affecting the overall situation. Especially at the critical moment of the great leap forward in production and construction, all aspects should avoid such phenomena of uncoordinated cooperation. At the same time, due to the leap forward in various industrial and agricultural constructions, the current demand for materials in various cities and rural areas is very large. The freight transport of railways, highways, and waterways is very busy. If the passenger volume increases too much, it will inevitably squeeze out a part of the freight transport and delay construction. In these days of racing against time, we can only allow materials supporting industrial and agricultural construction to rush day and night to places where they are urgently needed, and we should not let them stay on the platform or dock sighing, let some factories and mines stop working and wait for materials, and let agricultural cooperative members look forward with eager anticipation. The phenomenon that occurred in some cities around the Spring Festival last year of stopping freight transport for a few days due to excessive passenger volume should not be repeated this year. Therefore, according to the requirements of this year's new high tide of production, the number of workers going home during the Spring Festival this year should be less than in previous years, not more.
　　For individuals, squeezing home around the Spring Festival is indeed more disadvantageous than advantageous. The journey is crowded, the road is difficult, and there are many inconveniences in getting on and off the vehicles, accommodation, and rest. It wastes time, costs more travel expenses, and is particularly tiring. It is much more convenient and economical to change the date of return. Now, the State Council's regulations on workers and staff returning home to visit relatives have been passed and will be implemented soon. According to these regulations, the return time of a large proportion of workers can be evenly distributed throughout the year based on production and work conditions. Some workers who are not entitled to visit relatives and must go home can also consider taking leave to go home at an appropriate time when production and work permit it. There is absolutely no need to squeeze home during the Spring Festival. Changing the date of return is just postponing the date a little, so what's wrong with that? Moreover, going home during the Spring Festival this year will also cause a loss, that is, missing the opportunity to participate in the rectification movement and exercise, which is even more difficult to compensate for.
　　Individual interests are subordinate to overall interests, and immediate interests are subordinate to long-term interests. This is the true color of the working class. Every worker should first put the country first, the overall and long-term interests first, and production and work first. From this point of view, we should consider and handle our own Spring Festival return issues. If you can not go home, don't go back, and if you can return later, don't return early. Everything is for building socialism. Everyone remembers that on this day last year, coal mine workers across the country enthusiastically responded to the call of the state, taking two fewer days off during the Spring Festival and producing more than 400,000 tons of raw coal for the country. At that time, as soon as many miners heard the decision of the State Council, they resolutely returned the tickets they had already bought, and some who were already on their way home also returned to the mine. This spirit of the Chinese coal mine workers loving the motherland and being selfless and forgetting themselves is worth learning from everyone. Last Spring Festival, many members of agricultural cooperatives only rested for one day and then took up shovels and dung baskets to go to production. This new atmosphere of breaking the "norm" will surely appear more universally this year. As for our comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, some of them are on the coastal islands and border areas, and some are in the ice and snow, day and night, regardless of holidays, they are all on duty there to defend our country's peaceful construction. Coal mine workers across the country, many agricultural cooperative members, and the vast number of PLA and PVA comrades can even take fewer days off or no days off during the Spring Festival, so why can't our other workers take fewer days off or return later?
　　In order to correctly solve this problem, we must also adopt the method of the mass line. The administrative, Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations of enterprises and government agencies should mobilize workers to launch discussions and debates on the issue of returning home during the Spring Festival, so that everyone understands the pros and cons and clears their minds. Leading cadres and Party and Youth League members should take the lead and try their best not to return home during the Spring Festival to ensure attendance before and after the Spring Festival. At the same time, recreational activities should be arranged for celebrating the Spring Festival holiday in accordance with the principle of frugality. During the three-day holiday, leading cadres and the masses should spend the Spring Festival intimately, enthusiastically, and happily together.
　　We firmly believe that the broad masses of workers who have improved their awareness in the great rectification movement will surely be able to break the "norm" of many years during this victorious Spring Festival of 1958, ensure the full attendance rate before and after the Spring Festival, and welcome this year's Spring Festival with constantly improving production results.

### 打破常规过春节

　　打破常规过春节
    再过几天，我国人民的一个传统的大节日——春节，就要来到了。在春节前夕，展开在我们面前的是一个雄伟的社会主义建设新高潮的动人景象。从东海之滨到帕米尔高原，从黑龙江到五指山，在我们可爱的祖国的方圆万里的疆土上，每一个角落里都涌现出一股空前的革命干劲，二千多万职工在车间、在矿井、在工地、在交通线上、在商店、在实验室、在教室、在办公室里紧张地劳动，增产和先进创举的捷报一个接着一个传来；几亿农民兄弟向大自然发动了新的进攻，一个声势浩大的兴修水利运动和积肥运动正在开展，一万万人日日夜夜战斗在水利工地上，要高山低头，使河水让路，全国四个月内开辟了一亿一千七百多万亩的灌溉面积，等于过去四千年开辟的灌溉面积的一半。在我国人民豪迈地超额完成了国民经济建设第一个五年计划之后，我国的第二个五年计划就有了这样美好的开端，这怎能不使全国人民更加干劲十足，信心百倍哩！
    正是在这振奋人心的大好时刻，我国人民习俗流传的春节佳期也来到了。“每逢佳节倍思亲”。许多职工都想利用春节假期回家走走，和亲属团聚，并且向他们拜年报喜。这是很自然的。许多职工禁不住农村中热火朝天搞生产的伟大场面的吸引，极想回去看看家乡的新面貌。这也是很自然的。
    但是，现在我们要和职工同志们讨论一下这个问题，先要请大家回忆一下往事：在过去几年，每逢春节前后，总要发生生产企业中出勤率或多或少降低和交通运输严重拥挤的情况，并且这已经算得是一种“常规”了。这种“常规”，不仅给生产建设事业带来了不少损失，对于职工本身也是弊多利少。毛主席一再教导过我们：“常规”不是不可侵犯的，革命派对于一切“常规”，都不应该无条件地当成金科玉律，当做菩萨供奉，如果它是阻碍社会主义建设事业的发展的，就必须无情地打破它。那么，我们对于往年春节前后的那种“常规”，应该采取什么态度呢？有无必要打破它？是否可能打破它呢？答案都只应该是肯定的。
    前面说过，目前我国正处在社会主义建设的新高潮中，企业、机关中生产、工作、整风、反浪费、除四害的各项运动和工作十分紧张。广大职工群众都热情高涨地参加了这些运动。一年之计在于春，一寸光阴一寸金，我们的时间万分宝贵。为了加速改变我国又穷又白的落后状况，实现“在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国”这一伟大目标，我们必须要善于争取时间，一分一秒都要珍惜，一分一秒都要力求用到生产建设上去，鼓足革命干劲，想尽一切办法，多、快、好、省地进行建设，力争上游，才能够迎头赶上。
    在这种情况下，我们每个职工应该首先考虑的，不是回家的问题，而是如何使生产继续高涨的问题。如果我们不打破“常规”，作了“常规”的俘虏，大家都挤着要趁春节回家，这对于国家建设事业不是很不利的吗？在这和时间赛跑的日子里，我们必须要使增产的箭头直线上升、跃进地上升。如果春节回家的职工过多，出勤率不能保证，增产的箭头就势必要回落。这，不仅是我国职工的一种不光采，特别会对国家建设事业带来不良的影响。我国的社会主义经济是有计划按比例发展的，如果一个部门、一个环节落后一步，就会扯住别的部门、别的环节的后腿，小则妨碍局部的建设事业，大则妨碍全局。尤其是在生产建设大跃进的关头，各方面更要避免出现这种协作失调的现象。同时，由于工农业各项建设的跃进，目前各地城市和农村所需要的物资，数量很大。铁路、公路、水路的货运十分繁忙。如果客运量增加过多，就必然要挤掉一部分货运，耽误建设。在这和时间赛跑的日子里，我们只能允许支援工农业建设的物资日夜不停地奔向迫切需要它们的地方，而不应该让它们呆在月台上、码头上叹气，让一些厂矿和工地停工待料，让农业社员望穿秋水。去年春节前后有的城市发生过的因为客运量过大而停止货运几天的现象，再不应该在今年重复发生了。所以，按照今年生产新高潮的要求来说，今年春节回家的职工只应该比往年少，而不应该比往年多。
    对于个人说来，挤在春节前后回家，也的的确确是弊多利少。旅途挤，行路难，上下车船，食宿休息，诸多不便。既耽搁时间，又多花路费，还特别疲累。远不如改期回家方便节省。现在，国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的规定已经通过，最近就要发布施行。按照这个规定，很大一部分职工的回家时间可以根据生产和工作的情况匀开在全年的各个月份里。有些不能享受探亲待遇的职工必需回家的，也可以考虑在生产和工作允许的情况下在适当的时候请假回家，完全可以不必都挤在春节回家。改期回家，只不过是把日子推迟一点，这又有何不可呢？并且，今年春节回家，还有一种损失，就是错过了参加整风运动锻炼的机会，这更是不容易得到补偿的。
    个人利益服从整体利益，眼前利益服从长远利益，这是工人阶级的本色。每个职工都应该首先以国家为重，以整体利益和长远利益为重，以生产和工作为重。由此出发，来考虑和处理自己的春节回家问题。能不回家就不回去，能迟回家的就不早回。一切为了建设社会主义。大家记得去年今日，全国煤矿职工热烈响应国家的号召，在春节少休假两天，为国家多生产了四十多万吨原煤。当时许多矿工一听到国务院的决定，毅然退掉了已经买好的车票，有的已在回家途中的也折回矿上。我国煤矿职工的这种热爱祖国、为公忘私的精神，值得大家学习。去年春节，也有很多农业社的社员，只休息一天，接着就拿起铁锹粪筐生产去了。这种打破“常规”的新气象，今年一定还会更普遍地出现。至于我们中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的同志们，他们有的在海岛边疆，有的在冰天雪地，不分昼夜，不分假日，都在那里为保卫我国的和平建设而值勤。全国煤矿职工、许多农业社员、广大解放军和志愿军同志，甚至可以在春节少休假、不休假，我们其他职工同志，何尝不能够少回家、迟回家呢？
    为了正确地解决这个问题，也必须采取群众路线的方法。企业、机关的行政和党、团、工会组织，应该发动职工对春节回家问题展开讨论和争辩，使大家明白利弊，打通思想。领导干部和党、团员要以身作则，首先自己尽量不在春节回家，保证春节前后出勤。同时，应该在节约的原则下安排好欢度春节假期的文娱活动，在三天假期内领导干部和群众一道亲密、热烈、愉快地过好春节。
    我们深信，在伟大的整风运动中提高了觉悟的广大职工，一定能够在这个胜利的1958年春节，打破多年的“常规”，保证春节前后出勤率的饱满，用不断提高的生产成绩来欢迎今年的春节。
