We completely agree with the reports made to the conference by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

We participated in this conference, listened to the reports of the responsible comrades and the speeches of representatives from various regions, and received great inspiration and encouragement. This conference fully reflects that the people of the whole country are working hard to rapidly build our country into a great socialist power. We believe that with such a unified national determination and revolutionary drive, the 1958 national economic construction plan will certainly be greatly overfulfilled, and the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan will be a victorious start.

In the past year, the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle have achieved great victories, and the socialist consciousness of China's working class has been greatly improved. Like other factories and enterprises, railway enterprises have also widely promoted democracy through extensive airing of views, big-character posters, and debates. Bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism have been criticized and corrected. The relationship between leaders and the masses has become closer, and the unity among employees has been strengthened. The employees have spoken their minds, and problems that have not been resolved for many years have been solved. Therefore, they are in a good mood and their enthusiasm for work has increased. In the past year, the tremendous changes in the international situation, with "the East wind prevailing over the West wind," have given the employees and the masses great encouragement. After Comrade Liu Shaoqi, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, called on the working class and the people of the whole country at the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little more, our railway workers all felt "clear-headed" and "full of energy." In the recent two months, new records and new atmospheres have continued to appear in production, gradually forming a large-scale high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production.

In order to adapt to and guarantee the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, railway workers are actively tapping potential, and can transport more goods and passengers to all parts of the country without increasing equipment.

Railway workers clearly realize that the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production nationwide will inevitably bring heavy transportation tasks to the railway sector. We are very moved to see that our peasant brothers are working hard day and night to build water conservancy projects and accumulate fertilizer, and the workers are struggling hard to realize industrialization as soon as possible. In order to adapt to and guarantee the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, railway transportation work must not lag behind, and must also make a big leap forward, otherwise it will affect the development of industry and agriculture. Therefore, railway workers are actively tapping potential to improve transportation efficiency and transportation capacity. Recently, railway workers in Beijing inspected the shortcomings of the train operation chart formulated in the past, such as conservative speed and deviations from reality in the compilation. They first conducted experiments on the main lines, and after revising it from February 1 this year, they can add ten more pairs of trains on the Beijing-Baotou, Beijing-Shanhaiguan, and Beijing-Guangzhou lines. The workers are actively thinking of ways to increase the permissible speed of the lines. Before the end of April, the train speed on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan line will be increased to 95-110 kilometers per hour, from the original 80-95 kilometers per hour. The special express train from Beijing to Tianjin now takes one hour and forty-five minutes. After the recent speed increase experiment, it can be reached in one hour and thirty minutes. In this way, without increasing equipment, more goods and passengers can be transported to all parts of the country, and the Great Leap Forward in transportation can meet the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture.

In order to implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results, in the past month, the various railway departments in the Beijing area have launched a special airing of views centered on anti-waste and anti-conservatism, forming the second high tide of airing views since the rectification campaign. The Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory alone posted 2,558 big-character posters from January 8 to February 3, and put forward 8,225 criticisms and suggestions, revealing losses of 1.56 million yuan caused by waste in various aspects. In the anti-waste movement, employees criticized and self-criticized the "railway family is big and waste a little is nothing" mentality and the wrong idea of disregarding overall interests for personal interests. In order to eliminate such serious waste, the factory organized six professional groups to study and formulate ways to eliminate waste from management and technical aspects. In the Beijing railway construction department, the revolutionary spirit was used to break outdated rules and review and revise construction projects with excessively high cost standards, saving the country 12 million yuan in investment.

Railway workers have put forward the slogan "compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced." After the comparison, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the employees has been greatly stimulated, and they are all striving to catch up with the advanced level.

When discussing and formulating this year's plan for increasing production and practicing economy, railway workers put forward the slogan "compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced." The Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory compared several major indicators with the major indicators of other locomotive and rolling stock repair factories. Before the comparison, some cadres and employees thought that their work was already good, but after the comparison, they were shocked to find that some indicators were far behind other factories. For example, the overhaul cost of locomotives in the Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory was 21,000 yuan, while in the Changxindian Factory it was 28,000 yuan; the number of days locomotives stayed in the factory in the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory was 13.9 days, while in the Changxindian Factory it was 16.8 days. This comparison greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of all employees to improve. In order to catch up with the advanced and overcome their backwardness, everyone used their brains and quickly came up with many good ideas. In addition, they learned from the experience of fraternal factories and conscientiously implemented it in production. After more than a month of efforts, 98 measures were implemented in locomotive repair, which reduced the number of days locomotives stayed in the factory for overhaul from 16.8 days to 11 days in January, catching up with and exceeding the level of 13.9 days in the Qishuyan Factory. By learning from the experience of the Mudanjiang Factory and trying to adopt the method of reforming old parts, the overhaul and medium repair costs of locomotives in January were reduced by 4,300 yuan and 3,900 yuan respectively. Compared with other factories, the Changxindian Factory rose from the original eighth and sixth places to the third and second places. Not only that, the quality of repair has also been improved. The employees of the locomotive department of the Beijing Railway Administration compared the coal consumption of locomotives with various bureaus across the country and found that they were in fourth place after the Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Jinan Railway Bureaus. After research, they put forward the slogan "compare, compete, surpass the Jinan and Guangzhou Bureaus, and catch up with Shanghai." The employees calculated the details and proposed that 60,000 tons of coal could be saved throughout the year, which is equivalent to not asking the country for fuel for seventeen days. The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot has already ordered this year's plan to increase production and practice economy. They plan to save 360 tons of coal throughout the year. In the severe cold weather in January, they not only overfulfilled the transportation task, but also saved 34 tons of coal, which motivated other locomotive groups to follow their example. The entire Fengtai Locomotive Depot can save the country 13,000 tons of coal throughout the year, and the entire depot's plan to increase production and practice economy amounts to 700,700 yuan. Lao Zheng Zemin and Zhao Zhemin, veteran workers of the Fengtai Engineering Section, together with transferred cadre Gong Qiying and engineering technicians, organized a technical research association to solve the problem of increasing the speed limit of the downward line 7 of the Fengtai Station on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan line. They conducted special research and proposed to change the radius of 430 degrees to 800 degrees, which can increase the speed limit from 65 kilometers to 90 kilometers. They also organized more than 100 youth shock team members. With the active support of the telecommunications section and the construction section, they started construction on January 26 and completed it successfully on January 30. After a trial run, the vehicle speed reached 100 kilometers per hour, so that the time from Beijing to Tianjin was shortened from the original 1 hour and 45 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes. The employees of the Fengtai Engineering Section launched a competition to collect and utilize waste materials in order to save more expenses for the country. In seven days in January, they collected more than 700 cubic meters of stone ballast and more than 400 cubic meters of rubble. In order to save wood, the workers spliced old sleepers together for utilization. In more than two months last year, they spliced 148,000 sleepers. An old worker discussed it with his wife and spliced the old sleepers he had bought over the years overnight and carried them to the work area together. The worker said this was "submitting husband and wife sleepers." The employees of the Beijing Train Section proposed to do a good job in serving passengers, and that this year they would not receive cleaning supplies from the country. Their method is to pick up cigarette butts and orange peels thrown away by passengers on the train. From Beijing to Chengdu, a train can pick up 60-70 kilograms of orange peels, which can be sold for six or seven yuan, and one kilogram of cigarette butts can also be sold for five jiao. Such a small matter can generate more than 15,000 yuan in revenue throughout the year. Such touching new atmospheres are everywhere. We believe that comparison is a good method, comparing is comparing with the advanced and catching up with the advanced. Through comparison, revolutionary enthusiasm is even greater. After the railway workers in the Beijing area compared with advanced areas across the country, they have a clearer understanding of their own shortcomings, which prompts us to work hard to catch up and strive to catch up with the advanced level.

Technical personnel should cooperate well with workers, strengthen railway traffic safety, eliminate traffic accidents, and overfulfill the country's transportation tasks.

Of course, we are not without difficulties. For example, some people still underestimate the power of the masses. They do not see the development of the new situation and promote the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers. This is bound to break through the quotas that were already outdated. However, they not only do not support and encourage the workers, but also shout that they are advancing rashly. Even when the workers have made achievements, they say that it is an adventure. There are also a few engineering and technical personnel who formulate plans and measures behind closed doors and do not pay attention to combining them with the practice of the workers. Especially on the issue of safe production, technical personnel need to regularly guide workers on how to prevent accidents, and the cooperation in this area is not enough. In the Great Leap Forward of railway transportation tasks, the struggle of all railway employees to harm railway traffic safety and eliminate traffic accidents is even more arduous. However, we firmly believe that these difficulties and shortcomings in work will be gradually resolved in the deepening of the rectification campaign and the high tide of production, because we know that the responsibility of the working class is heavy, and we must not be satisfied with the status quo and stop moving forward at any time. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, the railway workers and the people of the whole country will unite as one, work hard, and any difficulties will be conquered by us. We are full of confidence and will definitely overfulfill the transportation tasks given to us by the country. In the Great Leap Forward in production, we will contribute everything we have to the great cause of socialism in our motherland.

    促使运输大跃进迎接生产大跃进
    李永　李树森　郭树德代表谈铁路职工的革命干劲
    我们完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任向大会所作的报告。
    我们参加了这次会议，听了各位负责同志的报告和各地代表的发言，受到了很大的启发和鼓舞，这次会议充分地反映了全国人民都在为迅速地把我国建成一个伟大的社会主义强国而辛勤劳动。我们相信，有了这样全国一致的坚定信心和革命干劲，一九五八年度国家经济建设计划一定能够大大地超额完成，第二个五年计划的头一年将是一个胜利的开端。
    去年一年，整风运动和反右派斗争取得了伟大的胜利，我国工人阶级社会主义觉悟大大提高。铁路企业也像其他工厂企业一样，经过大鸣大放、大字报和大辩论，广泛发扬了民主，官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义受到了批判和纠正，领导和群众的关系更密切了，职工之间也更加团结了，职工们心里的话全说出来了，多年来得不到解决的问题解决了，因此心情舒畅，工作劲头也上来了。去年一年中，国际形势的巨大变化，“东风压倒西风”，更给了职工群众很大的鼓舞。刘少奇同志代表党中央在工会第八次全国代表大会上向全国工人阶级和全国人民提出了在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内赶上或者超过英国的号召以后，我们铁路职工们个个都觉得“心明眼亮”，“浑身是劲”。最近两个月来，生产上不断出现新纪录、新气象，逐渐形成了一个规模壮大的生产大跃进的高潮。
    为适应和保证工农业大跃进，铁路职工积极挖掘潜力，可以不增加设备，就能把更多的货物和旅客运往全国各地。
    铁路职工们清楚地认识到：全国工农业生产的大跃进，必然给铁路部门带来繁重的运输任务。我们十分感动地看到了农民兄弟为了兴修水利和积肥正在夜以继日地苦干，工人们为了早日实现工业化而在艰苦奋斗。为了适应和保证工业、农业方面的大跃进，铁路运输工作绝不能落后，也必须大大跃进一步，不然就会影响到工农业的发展。因此，铁路职工们正在积极地挖掘潜力来提高运输效率和运输能力。最近北京铁路职工们检查了过去所制订的列车运行图中存在的速度保守、编制上脱离实际的缺点，先在主要干线上作了试验，从今年二月一日起进行了修改后，可以使京包、京山、京广几条干线多加十对车，职工们正在积极想办法，提高线路允许速度。北京——山海关在四月底以前将要把列车速度提高到每小时九十五至一百一十公里，原来是八十至九十五公里。北京——天津的特别快车现在是一小时四十五分，经过最近的试验，提高速度后，一小时三十分钟就可以到了。这样就可以在不增加设备的条件下，把更多的货物和旅客运往全国各地，以运输的大跃进来迎接工农业的大跃进。
    为了贯彻勤俭建国和多、快、好、省的方针，近一个月来，北京地区铁路各个部门已经掀起了以反浪费、反保守为中心的专题鸣放，形成了整风以来第二个大鸣放高潮。仅长辛店机车车辆修理工厂从一月八日到二月三日，就贴出了大字报二千五百五十八张，提出了批评和建议八千二百二十五条，揭发出因各方面浪费造成的损失就达一百五十六万元。反浪费运动中，职工们通过批评和自我批评，批判了“铁路家大业大，浪费一点没什么”的大少爷思想，为了个人利益不顾整体利益的错误思想。为了消除这样严重的浪费，工厂组织了六个专业小组，从管理上，从技术上来研究制定消除浪费的办法。在北京铁路基建部门，用革命精神打破陋规，审查修改了造价标准过高的工程项目，为国家节省投资一千二百万元。
    铁路职工提出了“比先进，赶先进”的口号。经过评比，大大激发了职工的革命干劲，都努力向先进水平看齐。
    在讨论制定今年的增产节约计划时，铁路职工们提出了“比先进，赶上先进”的口号，长辛店机车车辆修理工厂把几项主要指标与其他机车车辆修理厂的主要指标作了比较，在没比以前，有的干部和职工认为自己的工作已经不错啦，但在一比之下，就不得不大吃一惊，发现有的指标比其它厂差得很远。例如，机车大修成本，牡丹江机车修理厂是两万一千元，长辛店厂却是两万八千元；机车在厂日数，戚墅堰机车车辆修理厂是十三点九天，而长辛店却是十六点八天，这样一比就大大的激发了全厂职工的上进心，职工们为了赶上先进，克服自己的落后状态，大家开动了脑筋，很快地就想出来很多好办法，再加上学习来的兄弟工厂的经验，把它认真的贯彻在生产中，这样经过一个多月的努力，在机车修理方面，贯彻了九十八项措施，就使一月份检修机车在厂日数，从过去的十六点八天缩短到十一天，赶上和超过了戚墅堰厂的十三点九天的水平。由于学习了牡丹江厂的经验和尽量采用旧件改制的办法，使一月份机车大修、中修的成本分别降低四千三百元和三千九百元。这样和其它厂比较，长辛店厂则从原来第八位和第六位上升为第三位和第二位。不仅如此，就是在修车质量上也有了提高，北京铁路管理局机务部门的职工把机车用煤量和全国各局作了比较，发现自己是在上海、广州、济南各铁路局之后而居于第四位，经过了研究提出了“比一比，赛一赛，超过济、广局，迎头赶上上海”的口号，职工们算了细账，提出全年可以省煤六万吨，等于十七天不向国家要燃料。丰台机务段“毛泽东号机车”已经订了今年的增产节约计划，他们准备全年要节约煤三百六十吨，在一月份严寒的天气里，他们不仅超额完成了运输任务，还节约煤三十四吨，带动了其他机车组都向他看齐。丰台机务段全段全年可以为国家节约煤一万三千吨，全段增产节约计划共达七十万零七百元。丰台工务段老工人郑泽民、赵哲民和下放干部龚启英及工程技术人员等十多人，为了解决提高丰台车站京山下行七道的限速，组织了技术研究会，进行了专门研究，提出将半径四百三十度改为八百度的措施，可从限速六十五公里提高到九十公里，并组织了一百多名青年突击队员，在电务段、建筑段的积极支持下，从一月二十六号开始施工到一月三十日胜利完工，经过试车，达到每小时行车速度一百公里，这样从北京到天津由原来一点四十五分钟缩短到一点三十分钟。丰台工务段的职工为了更多地给国家节约开支，展开了收集和利用废旧料的竞赛，在一月份七天之中，就收集了七百多方石碴和四百多方片石。为了节省木材，工人们把旧枕木拼接起来加以利用，去年两个多月时间就拼接了枕木十四万八千根。有个老工人和自己的老伴商量好了，把多年买下的旧枕木连夜拼接好，一块抬到工区，工人说这是“献交夫妻枕”。北京列车段的职工提出要为旅客作好服务工作，并且今年一年可以不向国家领清扫用具，他们的方法是在列车上把旅客扔掉的烟头、橘子皮都拣起来，从北京到成都列车上一趟列车就可以拣六、七十斤橘子皮，可以卖六、七块钱，一斤烟头也可以卖五毛钱。这样一件小事，全年就可以收入一万五千元之多。这种动人的新气象真是到处皆是。我们认为评比是个好办法，比就是比先进，赶上先进。通过比，革命干劲就更足了。我们北京地区的铁路职工在全国先进地区比较了以后，对于我们自己的缺点认识就更清楚了，就促使我们要努力赶上去，要努力向先进水平看齐。
    技术人员应该很好地同工人配合，加强铁路行车安全，消灭行车事故，来超额完成国家的运输任务。
    当然，我们面前不是没有困难的，例如：现在还有某些人对群众的力量估计不足，他们看不到新形势的发展，推动了工人的革命干劲，这样势必要冲破本来已经过时的定额，可是他们不仅不支持鼓励工人，而且还叫喊冒进了，甚至当工人们作出了成绩，还说这是冒险，还有少数工程技术人员他们关着门制定计划措施，没有注意与工人的实践相结合。特别在安全生产问题上，需要技术人员经常指导工人如何防止事故，在这方面还配合不够。在铁路运输任务大跃进中，全路职工向危害铁路行车安全，消灭行车事故的斗争是更加艰巨了，但是我们深信，这些困难与工作中的缺点将会在整风深入和生产高潮中逐步得到解决的，因为我们知道工人阶级的责任重大，在任何时候都不能满足现状和停止前进的，我们相信在党的领导下，铁路职工和全国人民团结一致，艰苦奋斗，任何困难都将被我们征服，我们是满怀信心的，一定能够超额完成国家所给予我们的运输任务。在生产大跃进中，我们将为祖国社会主义的伟大事业贡献出我们的一切。
