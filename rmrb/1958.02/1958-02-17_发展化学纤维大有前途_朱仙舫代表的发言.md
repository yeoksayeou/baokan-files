Developing Chemical Fibers Has Great Potential
    Speech by Representative Zhu Xianfang
    Chemical fibers have a very wide range of applications and are very inexpensive, and they have advantages that natural fibers cannot match. Therefore, during the Second Five-Year Plan, measures should be taken quickly to develop China's chemical fiber industry to meet the needs of China's socialist construction and the people's lives.
    I completely agree with and support all the reports of the Congress. Now, I will talk about the possibility of developing chemical fibers, which is urgently needed:
    In 1957, after the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, we achieved great victories on the political and ideological fronts. This encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people and promoted the victory of economic construction. The victories on all fronts consolidated the unity of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the working class, consolidated the socialist system, and completed and overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan, filling people with confidence in socialist construction. Our enthusiasm for developing chemical fibers is growing stronger and stronger.
    People can roughly divide chemical fibers obtained by chemical methods into two major categories, namely, rayon and synthetic fibers.
    If the fibers obtained by chemical methods are composed of the same molecules as the raw materials, this is called rayon. For example, artificial viscose and the matrix of wood are both composed of the same cellulose linear molecules. When wood is transformed into rayon by chemical methods, the cellulose molecules only change their own arrangement. Sometimes the cellulose molecules undergo chemical changes and generate new fibers that are beneficial for spinning. The rayon made from one cubic meter of wood is as much as that reeled from 320,000 catties of silkworm cocoons, or 160 kilograms of artificial wool obtained from the same amount of wood, which is equivalent to the amount sheared from 30 sheep in a year. Using short cotton fibers and waste cotton from yarn factories obtained from cottonseeds, artificial fibers can be made by chemical methods to replace good cotton. Other herbaceous plants that can be used as raw materials for making rayon are all found and utilized, and the quantity is unlimited. In particular, cellulose fibers are very low in cost and suitable for the living standards of the Chinese people. Whether used alone or blended and interwoven with natural fibers, they can not only directly supplement the shortage of cotton cloth, but also make clever use of their advantages and characteristics to match them, which is very popular among the broad masses of people.
    In the same way, chemical methods can also be used to make a fiber whose molecules are all newly constructed, that is, these molecules are synthesized from the smallest and simplest molecules. This is called synthetic fiber. The process of manufacturing synthetic fibers is more complicated, but the raw materials are extremely extensive, namely air, water, coal, and limestone, so they are inexhaustible and indeed an infinite treasure. Moreover, when joint factories are adopted and other industries cooperate in production, the cost can be greatly reduced. For example, in places with coking plants, with convenient drainage and transportation, the construction of the synthetic fiber industry can recover the entire investment within two or three years. The emergence of synthetic fibers is a great achievement of modern mankind in the struggle against nature. Moreover, its application range is extremely wide, in fact, it has exceeded people's expectations. It is not only a substitute for raw materials in the textile industry, but also able to meet various requirements and become an independent raw material. In terms of daily necessities, there are currently shirt fabrics, linings, outerwear fabrics, curtains, socks, blankets, sewing threads, decorative fabrics, work clothes, etc. In terms of industry, there are currently filter cloths, canvas, fishing nets, tire fabrics, ropes, water hoses, electrical insulation wires, protective work clothes, special parachutes, etc. In terms of blending and interweaving with rayon or natural fibers, they can all complement each other to make up for the shortcomings in use and economy, and give play to their unique properties. In short, the common characteristics of synthetic fibers are that they have high strength and elasticity, are resistant to friction, resistant to wrinkles, not easily stained, easy to wash and quick-drying, have low water absorption, and have the characteristics of being resistant to acid, alkali, and light, and they can also protect objects from the effects of extreme heat and cold. Therefore, synthetic fibers each have their own special strengths, and have opened up a new era that is far superior to natural fibers.
    Looking at Japan in 1956, the ratio of natural fibers to chemical fibers was eight to three. It is planned to reach a ratio of six to four by 1960. Japan does not have much land and must develop chemical fibers. The United States is the world's largest cotton producer and cannot use it all up by itself, and exports a large amount every year. According to the report of its Raw Materials Policy Committee, in 1975, the planned fiber consumption was 48 percent natural fibers and 52 percent chemical fibers. It is not difficult to imagine that in the future, the ratio of human consumption of fibers will definitely exceed natural fibers. The main factors for its rapid development are, first of all, that the raw materials for chemical fibers are abundant and widely available, unlike cotton, wool, silk, and hemp, which are restricted by natural conditions. Secondly, chemical fibers are inexpensive and suitable for the purchasing power of the vast consumers. It is estimated that the cost of rayon is about one-twentieth of that of real silk, and the cost of artificial wool is about 20 percent of that of wool. Thirdly, chemical fibers have superior properties compared to natural fibers. Moreover, with the improvement of production technology, the increase in varieties, and the improvement of quality, the uses are constantly expanding. It must be pointed out that with the increase in the population of various countries, the development of the economy, and especially the increasing improvement of life, the production of chemical fibers will further leap forward.
    After the successful completion and overfulfillment of our country's First Five-Year Plan, this year is the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan. From the great call made by the Central Committee to "catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and other important product output in fifteen years," China's chemical fiber industry should especially take immediate action and adopt measures to rapidly develop with an overwhelming momentum. Currently, there are the Shanghai Anle and Liaoning Andong Rayon Factories, as well as the newly built Baoding Rayon Factory and Beijing Synthetic Fiber Factory, and during the Second Five-Year Plan, new chemical fiber factories will be built with a total annual output of 100,000 tons. This is a great happy event in people's lives. We must have full confidence, boost our energy, and strive to overfulfill the task. However, there are very few experts in this field. We should immediately add chemical fiber departments in relevant universities, and select a number of university graduates to go to these factories to study in a planned and step-by-step manner, and separately select a number of people to send to the chemical fiber factory in the German Democratic Republic for internships. In this way, we can proceed in multiple ways, both internally and externally, and in the Second Five-Year Plan, we will definitely be able to train a group of red and expert technical cadres, actively work hard, think of all ways, and implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, and running enterprises with diligence and thrift, to serve the people in developing the chemical fiber industry in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

    发展化学纤维大有前途
    朱仙舫代表的发言
    化学纤维应用的范围十分广大，成本又非常低廉，而且具有天然纤维所无法比拟的优点，因此，在第二个五年计划期间应该赶快采取措施，发展我国的化学纤维工业，以适应我国社会主义建设和人民生活的需要。
    我完全同意并拥护大会各项报告。现就目前亟须发展化学纤维的可能性来谈一下：
    一九五七年中，经过整风运动和反右派斗争，我们在政治战线和思想战线上都取得了伟大胜利。从而鼓舞了广大人民的热情，促进了经济建设上的胜利。在各个战线上胜利的结果，巩固了全国人民在工人阶级领导下的团结，巩固了社会主义的制度，并且完成和超额完成了第一个五年计划，使人们对于社会主义的建设，充满了信心。我们发展化学纤维的劲头，也就越来越大了。
    人们对用化学方法所得的化学纤维，大约可分为两大类，即人造纤维和合成纤维。
    用化学方法所得的纤维，如果是和原料中同一样的分子所组成的，这种就叫人造纤维。例如人造的粘胶和木材的基质，都是由相同的纤维素的线状分子，当用化学方法，将木材转变成人造纤维的时候，纤维素的分子，只是改变本身的排列，有的时候纤维素的分子，在化学上起了变化，并生成新的利于纺织的纤维。从一立方公尺木材所造的人造丝，和由三十二万斤蚕茧缫出的一样多，或从同数量木材所得一百六十公斤的人造羊毛，约相当于三十只羊在一年里所剪下来的。利用棉籽剥下的短绒及纱厂的废棉，用化学方法，制成人造纤维，即可代替好棉。其他草本植物，凡可以用作原料制成人造纤维的，都一一寻找出来，加以利用，其数量是无限制的。特别是纤维素的纤维，成本更属低廉，适合我国人民的生活水平，无论单独或与天然纤维混纺交织，不仅可以直接补充棉布的不足，且能利用优点特性，巧为配合，更是广大群众所乐用。
    用化学方法，同样也可制得这样一种纤维，组成它的分子，都是从新构成的，就是这些分子是由最小又最简单的分子合成的。这种就叫合成纤维。制造合成纤维的过程较多，但其原料存在极其广泛，就是空气、水、煤炭、石灰石，所以取之不尽，确是无限宝藏。况采用联合工厂，有其他工业共同协作生产时，成本就可以大大地降低的。如在炼焦厂地方，并有排水及运输的方便，建设合成纤维工业，二年后或三年期内，即可将全部投资收回。合成纤维的出现，是近代人类对自然界作斗争的伟大成果。且其应用范围极为广阔，事实上，已超过人们想望，不仅是纺织工业原料的代用品，而且能够适应多方面的要求，自成为一独立的原料。在日用品方面，当前衬衣、衬衫、外衣的衣料，窗帘，袜子，毯子，缝线，装饰布，工作服等。在工业方面，当前滤布，帆布，渔网，轮胎布，绳索，水龙带，电绝缘线，防护工作服，特种降落伞等。在与人造纤维或天然纤维混纺交织方面，都能互相弥补在使用上与经济上的缺点，发挥其特有的性能。总而言之，合成纤维的共同特性，强力弹性均大，耐摩擦，耐折皱，不易沾污，易洗快干，吸水性小，有耐酸，耐碱，耐光度较强的特点，亦有对酷热严寒，能保护物体而不受影响。所以合成纤维都各有特长，在目前已经开辟了新的纪元，远非天然纤维所可比拟。
    且看，日本一九五六年天然纤维与化学纤维的比例为八比三，预定到一九六○年要达六比四的比例，日本土地不大，自须向化学纤维方面发展。美国是世界第一产棉国，自用不完，每年大量输出，查其给原料政策委员会报告中，在一九七五年，预定纤维消费量，天然纤维百分之四十八，化学纤维百分之五十二的比例。不难想到，今后人类对纤维消费量的比例，化学纤维将要超过天然纤维，这是很肯定的。其能迅速发展的主要因素，首先是化学纤维的原料丰富，产地广泛，不像棉、毛、丝、麻等受自然条件的限制。其次化学纤维成本低廉，适合广大消费者的购买力，据估计，人造丝的成本约为真丝的二十分之一，人造毛的成本约为羊毛的百分之二十。再次，化学纤维比较天然纤维，各具有优越的性能。且随着生产技术的提高，品种的增加，质量的改进，因而用途不断地扩大。必须指出，随着各国人口的增加，经济的发展，尤其是生活日益提高的情况下，化学纤维的生产，将会进一步向前飞跃发展。
    在我国第一个五年计划胜利完成和超额完成后，接着今年又是第二个五年计划的开始，从中央提出“十五年在钢铁和其他重要产品产量方面赶上或者超过英国”的伟大号召看来，我国化学纤维工业，尤应剑及履及，以排山倒海之势，迅谋发展的措施。目前已有上海安乐和辽宁安东人造纤维厂，又有保定人造纤维厂和北京合成纤维厂的新建，并且在第二个五年计划期内，新建化学纤维厂，年产量共达十万吨。这是人民生活中的一件大喜事。必须信心百倍，鼓起干劲，争取超额完成。但是这类技术专家极少。亟应一面在相当的大学内，增设化学纤维系科，一面在大学毕业生中，选派若干人，到些工厂，有计划，有步骤，分别实地钻研，另选派若干人，送德意志民主共和国化学纤维厂实习。这样内外双管齐下，多方设法进行，在第二个五年计划期间，定能培养一批又红又专的技术干部，积极努力，想尽办法，贯彻勤俭建国，勤俭办企业，又多又快又好又省的方针，来为人民发展化学纤维工业服务。
    以上是否有当，请批评指正。
