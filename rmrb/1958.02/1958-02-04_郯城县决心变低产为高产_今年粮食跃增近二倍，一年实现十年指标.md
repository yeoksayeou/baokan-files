Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 2nd: Tancheng County, one of the ten low-yield counties in Shandong Province, is determined to muster revolutionary vigor to transform itself from a low-yield county to a high-yield county. In 1956, the county's average grain yield was only 189 jin per mu. This year, the planned yield is 500 jin per mu, with the goal of reaching 1,000 jin per mu by 1962. Their slogan is: "Work hard for one year to realize the Program, work hard for five years to catch up with the South of the Yangtze River!"

　　The Tancheng County Party Committee believes that the county's low output in the past was not due to poor natural conditions, but mainly due to right-leaning conservatism, bureaucracy, and a general work style on the part of the leadership. The county has flat terrain, crisscrossing rivers, abundant rainfall, plentiful water sources, a warm climate, an early spring, a long growing season for plants, and relatively fertile land, with great production potential. The development of the winter production campaign last year also proved that the masses had ample enthusiasm to conquer nature, and the county committee's 1958 production plan targets, with the exception of the 400,000 mu irrigated land expansion plan (which has been 88% completed), have all been exceeded. As of January 20th, the plan to complete 400,000 mu of waterlogged farmland for the entire year had been fulfilled by 140%; the plan to deep-plow 300,000 mu had been fulfilled by 117%; the plan to winter-plow 450,000 mu had been fulfilled by 115%; the plan to raise 130,000 pigs had been fulfilled by 102%; the plan to apply 4,000 jin of manure per mu had been fulfilled by 125%; and the plan for sideline income of 1.2 million yuan had been fulfilled by 120%. The county committee planned to basically change the old habits of no toilets for people, no pens for pigs, no accumulation of fertilizer, and lack of sanitation this year. As a result, this requirement was basically achieved in just over a month.

　　The county committee analyzed and ranked various factors and believes that achieving the target of 500 jin per mu this year is entirely possible. The main basis and corresponding measures are: (1) Irrigated land will be expanded from the original plan of 400,000 mu to 700,000 mu, exceeding the original irrigated area by 18 times; (2) Raising 400,000 pigs, striving to reach 550,000 pigs, with an average of three to four pigs per household, exceeding the original number of pigs raised by three to four times, and applying 6,000 to 8,000 jin of manure per mu, exceeding the original amount of fertilizer applied by three to four times; (3) The 560,000 mu of waterlogged and low-lying land that was completely transformed in the previous stage will be further renovated and improved in quality before spring plowing, exceeding the total amount of transformation in the past few years by more than five times; (4) Through measures such as building earth dikes, horizontal ditches, and terraced ridges, 250,000 mu of winter-fallow land in hilly areas will have preliminary water and soil conservation projects completed before spring plowing; (5) Deep plowing, sand pressing, and soil improvement on 400,000 mu, exceeding the total amount in previous years by three times; (6) Increasing the planting of high-yield crops – 200,000 mu of rice (including 100,000 mu of dry-sown rice) and 90,000 mu of sweet potatoes; (7) Vigorously promoting comprehensive advanced technical measures for various crops. If the above measures are realized, they can guarantee the completion of the target of 500 jin per mu this year.

　　In order to ensure the realization of the above targets and measures, the county committee believes that it is necessary to race against time, and all party members and cadres must have a combat-oriented work style, act immediately, seize opportunities, and pursue them to the end. At the same time, it is necessary to further mobilize all forces in various departments to serve the realization of the great leap forward in production.

　　郯城县决心变低产为高产
    今年粮食跃增近二倍，一年实现十年指标
    本报特约新华社济南2日电　山东省十个低产县之一的郯城县，决心鼓足革命干劲变低产县为高产县。这个县1956年平均亩产粮食只有一百八十九斤，今年计划亩产粮食五百斤，到1962年实现亩产千斤粮。他们的口号是：“苦干一年，实现纲要，苦干五年，赶上江南。”
    中共郯城县委认为，郯城县过去的产量低，不是因为自然条件不好，主要是领导上的右倾保守、官僚主义和一般化的作风。全县地势平坦，大小河流纵横，雨量充沛，水源丰富，气候温暖，开春早，植物生长期较长，土地比较肥沃，生产潜力极大。去年冬季生产运动发展形势也证明了广大群众征服自然的劲头很足，县委制定的1958年各项生产规划指标，除扩大四十万亩水浇田计划已完成了88％以外，其他各项计划指标都被突破了。到1月20日止，计划全年完成除涝农田四十万亩，实际完成了140％；计划深翻地三十万亩，完成了117％；计划冬耕四十五万亩，完成了115％；计划养猪十三万头，完成了102％；计划每亩施粪四千斤，完成了125％；计划副业收入一百二十万元，完成了120％。县委计划今年全县平均亩产三百二十斤，而大部分区、乡的计划是五百斤到七百斤；县委要求今年度基本上改变人无厕所、猪无圈，不积肥，不卫生的旧习惯，结果这个要求在一个多月的时间内就基本实现了。
    县委从各方面分析、排队，认为今年实现亩产五百斤的指标是完全可能的。主要的根据和相应的措施是：（1）水浇地由原来计划的四十万亩扩大到七十万亩，超过原有水浇地面积的十八倍；（2）养猪四十万头，争取达到五十五万头，每户平均三至四头，超过原养猪数的三倍到四倍，每亩施粪六千斤到八千斤，超过原施肥量的三倍到四倍；（3）将前一阶段全部改造完的五十六万亩涝洼地，在春耕前进一步整修提高质量，超过过去几年改造总数的五倍多；（4）通过培地堰、水平沟、培畦埂等措施，将丘陵地区的二十五万亩冬闲地，在春耕前作好初具规模的水土保持工程；（5）深翻地、压沙、改良土壤四十万亩，超过往年总数的三倍；（6）增种高产作物——水稻二十万亩（包括旱播水稻十万亩）、地瓜九万亩；（7）大力搞好各项作物的综合性的先进技术措施。以上措施实现了，就能保证完成今年亩产五百斤的指标。
    为了保证实现以上指标和措施，县委认为，要和时间赛跑，全体党员、干部要有战斗化的作风，说干就干，抓住不放，一抓到底。同时要进一步调动各部门的一切力量，为实现生产大跃进服务。
