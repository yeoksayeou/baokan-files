　　Little Song of Digging Wells and Accumulating Manure
　　Li Yuenan
　　Water, water, is gold,
　　Spring, spring, is the lifeline,
　　We must turn dry land into irrigated land,
　　Sweet rain comes from under the well auger!
　　Lanterns and torches light up the night,
　　The fields are filled with laughter and cheer,
　　Everyone says that clear spring water has emerged,
　　Collective farmers don't rely on heaven!
　　Get up early to accumulate manure by sunlight,
　　Reluctant to retire late, accumulate manure by moonlight.
　　Accumulate manure in the dark of night with a lantern,
　　With a sky full of stars overhead!
　　Crops are like a flower,
　　A good harvest depends entirely on manure,
　　With enough manure and diligent watering, there's no need to ask,
　　The yield per mu will exceed four or five hundred and eighty!
　　The head of the commune goes out carrying a manure basket,
　　Picking up the manure scoop with a clang,
　　Walking along, picking up manure along the way,
　　All for crossing the Yangtze River next year!
　　Men and women, young and old, all come together,
　　Some shovel, some carry,
　　Tree leaves and grass clippings are most precious,
　　Manure is stronger than a golden platform!

　　打井积肥小唱
　　李岳南
    水呀水，是黄金，
    泉呀泉，是命根，
    要把旱田变成水浇地，
    井锥底下出甘霖！
    灯笼火把照夜间，
    田野一片笑语喧，
    都说出了清泉水，
    集体的农民不靠天！
    起早积肥趁太阳灯，
    恋晚积肥有月亮灯。
    夜黑积肥提围灯，
    头上还顶着满天星！
    庄稼本是一枝花，
    丰收全凭粪当家，
    粪大水勤不用问，
    亩产超过四五八！
    社主任出门背粪筐，
    拿起粪杓响叮噹，
    一路走，一路拣，
    为的是明年过长江！
    男女老少一齐来，
    铲的铲，抬的抬，
    树叶、草沫最为贵，
    粪雄强似黄金台！
