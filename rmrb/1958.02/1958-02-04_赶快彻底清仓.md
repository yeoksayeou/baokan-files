　　Hurry Up and Thoroughly Clear the Warehouse
    The Building Science Research Institute directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering has a large amount of accumulated instruments and equipment, resulting in appalling waste. The instruments and equipment purchased by this research institute in recent years, currently still stockpiled, amounts to more than 700 pieces, worth more than 1.1 million yuan, equivalent to about one-quarter of the total value of instruments purchased over the years. For example, a ten-ton bridge crane purchased in 1955, worth more than 66,000 yuan, has been left in the open air for more than three years due to non-compliance with specifications; a set of automatic telephone exchange and two hundred table-top telephones purchased from abroad in 1955, worth more than 92,000 yuan, have been stockpiled for more than three years because the order was placed too early, and the decision was later made to stop the building construction, so these equipment have nowhere to be installed.

    Among these stockpiled instruments, 95 pieces have been damaged due to poor management, worth more than 99,000 yuan. Thirty-one pieces have been lost, worth more than 3,000 yuan. Even individual instruments have been stored in the warehouse of the station for a long time, and have not even been retrieved.

    Although the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Beijing Dongdan Construction Bank, together with the institute, conducted a preliminary inventory of accounts and inventory last year, the waste phenomenon can be said to remain the same due to a lack of determination and departmentalism. We hope that this research institute will quickly and thoroughly burn away the waste phenomenon in this warehouse clearing campaign.

### 赶快彻底清仓

　　赶快彻底清仓
    建筑工程部直属建筑科学研究院积压着大量的仪器设备，浪费惊人。这个研究院这几年买进的仪器设备，目前还积压着七百多件，价值一百一十多万元，相当于历年购进仪器总值的四分之一左右。例如，1955年购入的十吨桥式吊车，价值六万六千多元，由于不合规格，已露天搁置三年多了；1955年从国外购入的一套自动电话交换机和二百门桌式电话机，价值九万二千多元，因为订购太早，后来决定楼房停建了，这些设备就无处可安，到现在已经积压三年多了。
    这些积压的仪器中，由于管理得不好，已损坏九十五件，价值九万九千多元。丢失了三十一件，价值三千多元。甚至个别仪器还长期存放在车站的仓库里，连取都没有取回来。
    虽然去年建筑工程部和北京东单建设银行会同这个院，对账务、库存进行了初步整理，但由于决心不大和本位主义，浪费现象可以说依然如故。我们希望这个研究院赶快在这次清仓运动中，彻底烧掉浪费现象。
