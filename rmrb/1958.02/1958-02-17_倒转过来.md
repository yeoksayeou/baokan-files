    Turning It Upside Down
    Ruo Bo
    The laws of dialectics were originally abstracted and drawn from the objectively existing natural world and the history of human society; they were originally reflections of objective reality in the human mind. But Hegel turned it upside down, declaring that the development of the objective world was merely the embodiment of an absolute idea. Marx and Engels carried out the arduous task of "sublation" of Hegel's dialectics, scientifically transforming it and placing it on the foundation of materialism. Engels said in *Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy* that in this way, the dialectic of concepts was turned upside down, or rather, it was made to stand on its feet, because previously it had been standing on its head with its feet in the air.
    We should also view certain long-standing and habitually accepted viewpoints, which have become accustomed to being wrong, in the same way. They should also be transformed, going through a "negation of the negation," to "turn them upside down." What the working people and the proletariat consider to be true, good, and beautiful, the exploiting classes consider to be false, evil, and ugly; what the working people consider to be clean and glorious, the exploiting classes consider to be dirty and shameful. Similarly, what the working people consider joyful, the exploiting classes consider painful, even placing their own joy on the foundation of the suffering of the exploited. However, there is only one objective truth. What is "right" and what is "wrong" can be concluded with "the truth coming out"; those who personally engage in transforming nature and transforming society can also make correct answers based on the truth of Marxism.
    Human society was originally based on common labor, common consumption, equality for all, and mutual cooperation. Since the emergence of classes and the entry into class society, the history of human society and human thought have, without exception, been deeply stamped with the brand of class. The economic status of each class determines its stance and viewpoints. The exploiting classes, standing in a ruling position, rely on their power and employ "hanger-on literati" to call a deer a horse and turn black into white, forcing the working people to obey orders. Over thousands of years, some of these things have become ingrained habits, almost unbreakable. "Men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving," and helping one's sister-in-law out of drowning might even be considered "outrageous" and contrary to feudal ethics. "Those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others," hence, "all occupations are base, only studying is noble," leading to "in books, there are faces of jade; in books, there are houses of gold." And the cannibalistic capitalism can be seen as “eternal and unchangeable!” These "fooling the people" theories that take falsehood for truth and turn black and white upside down cannot be "turned upside down" without revolutionary changes that overturn the heavens and the earth and eradicate the roots.
    Example 1: Physical labor was originally combined with mental labor, and physical labor is the root of mental labor. Physical labor created the world, created social wealth, and also created mankind itself. Entering class society, physical labor and mental labor separated, to the point that the scholar-officials and bourgeois intellectuals who engaged in mental labor actually regarded themselves as "superior people," while calling physical laborers "inferior people." To reverse the head and feet of the separation of physical labor and mental labor, is it possible without a drastic revolution?
    Example 2: Perceptual knowledge was originally connected to rational knowledge, and perceptual knowledge is the basis of rational knowledge. Through practice, there is perceptual knowledge, and with perceptual knowledge, it is possible to generalize and rise to rational knowledge. Rational knowledge in books, if correct, is nothing but the experience accumulated by mankind in the process of production struggle and class struggle. Due to the separation of physical labor and mental labor, perceptual knowledge and rational knowledge are also separated. It seems that physical laborers can only be "Adous" who are "governed," while mental laborers, once they acquire rational knowledge from books, can ride on the heads of the people and "issue orders," considering themselves "smart people" with knowledge. To reverse the head and feet of the separation of perceptual knowledge and rational knowledge, can it be achieved without a profound revolution?
    Example 3: Landlords and peasants, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, were originally in a relationship of exploiters and the exploited. Because the landlords occupied the land and the bourgeoisie occupied the capital, forcing peasants to only rent land and the proletariat to only sell their labor, the truth of "who relies on whom" and "who supports whom" was reversed. It seemed that peasants were supported by the landlords' land and the proletariat was supported by the bourgeoisie's wages, while the fact that landlords and the bourgeoisie were supported by the surplus labor and surplus value created by the blood and sweat of the peasants and the proletariat was concealed and distorted. To reverse this head and feet of "who relies on whom" and "who supports whom," is it possible without a great democratic revolution and a socialist revolution?
    Examples are numerous and countless. To sum up, the standpoint and viewpoints of the exploiting classes have produced class prejudice and spread it to others, causing endless harm. People who still hold this standpoint and these viewpoints, if they do not undergo a revolutionary transformation that fundamentally "turns them upside down" in order to truly become a socialist new person who "stands on their feet," how can they be conducive to building socialism and serving the people?
    "Both Red and Expert" and "Going Down to the Countryside for Tempering" - these two slogans cannot but make us praise them as a revolution that turns the long-standing and habitually accepted prejudices that are head-down and feet-up!
    In his rectification report sixteen years ago, Chairman Mao instructed intellectuals that they should know a truth, that is: many intellectuals are actually the most ignorant, and the knowledge of workers and peasants is sometimes a little more than theirs. In fact, the knowledge of intellectuals is mostly learned from books, without experience, without perceptual knowledge as a foundation; it is inverted, it is retrograde, it is one-sided, it is what others have proven but they have not yet proven. However, many intellectuals, once they possess book knowledge, immediately become arrogant and conceited, looking down on everything, and everything starts from books, and the subjective nature of idealism accompanies it. If you want to turn it upside down and achieve a "negation of the negation," you must go to practice, to the working people, to the struggle for production and class struggle! The social situation we are in now, the storm of class struggle has largely passed, the people of the whole country are already striding forward to build socialism, bourgeois intellectuals have become "beams on the wall", and "three-door cadres" also have the "distress" of "growing too slowly." It is indeed necessary to go down to the countryside for tempering in order to achieve the fundamental transformation of "both Red and Expert."
    Cadres of Renmin University of China who went to the Sino-Czech Friendship Farm in Beijing to participate in labor tempering, after more than two months of production labor, under the factual education of fighting against nature, and in the practice of experiencing it firsthand, have initially established a correct view of physical labor and the working people, and have begun to have practical knowledge of agricultural production. They participated in digging canals, sinking wells, irrigating... Personally experienced labor tempering, and witnessed with their own eyes how physical labor changes the face of nature and also changes the face of society every day and every hour, undeniably realizing the hardship and difficulty of physical labor, and realizing that physical labor is not to be underestimated, and should be regarded as glorious, great, heroic, and worthy of pride. Some of them said, now I realize that physical labor is indeed the foundation of mental labor, and the struggle for production is the source of knowledge!
    Chairman Mao taught us that if you want to have knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality. People who personally participate in the practice of building socialism, participate in the production labor of changing the face of nature and society, and see with their own eyes the development of industry and agriculture, "tall buildings rising from the ground," will realize that "one bowl of porridge and one meal should be considered not easy to come by," will realize that "starting a business is difficult, maintaining it is easy," and truly love the working people, truly love socialism, and truly love the socialist motherland! The cadres who went down to the countryside from Renmin University of China have begun to realize that intellectuals should consciously accept transformation and consciously "turn upside down" their standpoint and viewpoints from the root, and truly become a new person who combines mental labor and physical labor. This shows that they have indeed realized the truth.

    倒转过来
    若波
    辩证法的规律，原来是从客观存在的自然界和人类社会的历史里概括抽引出来的，原来是客观现实在人类头脑里的反映，而黑格尔却把它颠倒过来，宣称客观世界的发展只是绝对观念的体现。马克思和恩格斯对黑格尔的辩证法作了艰巨的“扬弃”工作，加以科学的改造，把它放在唯物主义的基础之上。恩格斯在费尔巴哈论中说过，这样一来，概念的辩证法就被倒转过来，正确些说，使它脚着地站起来了，因为以前它是头着地脚朝天站着的。
    我们对于相沿成习，习非成是的某些观点，也应当作如是观，也应当经过改造，经过“否定之否定”，把它们“倒转过来”。劳动人民、无产阶级认为是真的、善的、美的，剥削阶级却认为是假的、恶的、丑的；劳动人民认为是干净的、光荣的，剥削阶级却认为是肮脏的、可耻的。同样，劳动人民认为是喜乐的，剥削阶级却认为是痛苦的，甚至把自己的喜乐放在被剥削者的痛苦的基础之上。然而，客观真理只有一个，什么是“是”，什么是“非”，马克思主义是能够作出“水落石出”的结论的；亲身经过变革自然、变革社会的身体力行者，也可能根据马克思主义的真理作出正确的回答的。
    人类社会原来是共同劳动，共同消费，人人平等，互助合作的。自从产生了阶级，进入了阶级社会以来，人类社会的历史，人类自己的思想，无一例外，都深深地打上了阶级的烙印，各阶级的经济地位决定了各阶级的立场和观点。站在统治地位的剥削阶级，就仗势欺人，依据权力，雇用“帮闲文人”，把世界上的客观事物指鹿为马，说黑成白，硬要劳动人民俯首听命，循至几千年来，有的相沿成习，几乎牢不可破了。“男女授受不亲”，嫂溺援之以手，也可能认为“大逆不道”，有悖封建礼教。“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”，于是，“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”，循至“书中自有颜如玉，书中自有黄金屋”。吃人的资本主义却也可以“永恒不变”！这些以假作真，黑白颠倒的“愚民”之说，如果不经过翻天复地，斩草除根的变革，“倒转过来”是没有可能的。
    例子之一：体力劳动原是同脑力劳动结合的，而且体力劳动是脑力劳动的根子。体力劳动创造了世界，创造了社会财富，也创造了人类自身。进到阶级社会，体力劳动同脑力劳动分家了，以至脑力劳动的士大夫和资产阶级知识分子竟自视为“上等人物”，而把体力劳动者叫做“下贱人”。要倒转体力劳动同脑力劳动分家的头脚，如果不经过一个剧烈的革命有这可能吗？
    例子之二：感性知识原是同理性知识衔接的，而且感性知识是理性知识的基础。经过实践，才有感性知识，有了感性知识，才可能概括上升成理性知识。书本上的理性知识，要是正确的话，也无一不是人类在生产斗争和阶级斗争过程中所积累起来的经验。由于体力劳动同脑力劳动的分家，从而感性知识同理性知识也割裂了。似乎体力劳动者只能是被“治”的“阿斗”，而脑力劳动者却只要一旦获得书本上的理性知识，就可以骑在人民头上“发号施令”，自以为是有知识的“聪明人”。要倒转感性知识同理性知识相割裂的头脚，如果不经过一个深刻的革命能不能实现呢？
    例子之三：地主同农民，资产阶级同无产阶级原是剥削者同被剥削者的关系。由于地主占有了土地，资产阶级占有了资本，逼使农民只能租种土地，无产阶级只能出卖自己的劳动力，从而“谁依靠谁”、“谁养活谁”的真相就被颠倒了，好像农民是依靠地主的土地而被养活的，无产阶级是依靠资产阶级的工资养活的，而地主、资产阶级被农民、无产阶级血汗创造的剩余劳动、剩余价值所供养的事实，却被掩盖和歪曲了。要倒转这一“谁依靠谁”、“谁养活谁”的头脚，如果不经过伟大的民主主义革命和社会主义革命，是可能的吗？
    例子繁多，不胜枚举。概括起来，剥削阶级的立场和观点，产生了阶级偏见，并且传之其人，流毒无穷。现在依然持有这种立场和观点的人，如果不来一个从根本上“倒转过来”的革命转变，以便真正做一个“脚着地站起来”的社会主义新人，怎有可能有利于建设社会主义，有利于为人民服务呢？
    “又红又专”，“下放锻炼”，这两个口号不能不让我们称颂是一个把头着地脚朝天的习非成是的偏见倒转过来的革命！
    毛主席在十六年以前所作的整风报告中，曾经指示知识分子应当知道一个真理，那就是：许多知识分子，其实是比较最无知识的，工农分子的知识有时倒比他们多一点。事实上是，知识分子的知识，大都是从书本上学来的，没有经过实践，没有感性知识作基础，是倒转的，是逆行的，是片面性的，是人家证明了而在他们还没有证明的。但是，许多知识分子一旦拥有了书本知识，立即狂妄自大，目空一切，而且一切都从书本出发，唯心主义的主观性也就伴随而来。如果要倒转过来，实现一个“否定的否定”，势非到实践中去，到劳动人民中去，到生产斗争和阶级斗争中去不可！我们现在所处的社会形势，狂风暴雨的阶级斗争大体已经基本过去，全国人民已经在为建设社会主义迈步跃进，资产阶级知识分子已经成为“梁上君子”，“三门干部”也有“成长太慢”的“苦闷”，确实需要下放锻炼，才能达到“又红又专”的根本转变。
    中国人民大学下放到北京市中捷友谊农场参加劳动锻炼的干部，经过两个多月的生产劳动，他们在向自然作斗争的事实教育下，在亲历其境的实践中，初步建立了对体力劳动和劳动人民的正确看法，并且开始有了农业生产的实际知识。他们参加了挖渠、打井、灌溉……亲身经历了劳动锻炼，亲眼看到了体力劳动每天每时地在改变着自然的面貌，也改变着社会的面貌，无可辩驳地体会到体力劳动的艰辛和繁难，体会到体力劳动是不可轻视的，是应当看作是光荣的、伟大的、豪迈的、值得骄傲的事情。他们之中有人说，这下我体会到体力劳动确实是脑力劳动的基础，生产斗争是知识的源泉！
    毛主席教导我们，你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。人们亲身参加了建设社会主义的实践，参加了改变自然的、社会的面貌的生产劳动，亲眼看到了“万丈高楼平地起”的工农业的发展，就会认识到“一粥一饭，当思来处之不易”，就会认识到“创业难，守成易”，而真正地爱劳动人民，真正地爱社会主义，真正地爱社会主义的祖国！中国人民大学的下放干部开始认识到知识分子应该自觉地接受改造，自觉地把立场和观点从根本上“倒转过来”，真正成为一个脑力劳动同体力劳动相结合的新人，这就表明他们确实认识到了真理。
