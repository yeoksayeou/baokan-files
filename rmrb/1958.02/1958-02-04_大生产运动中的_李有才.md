　　"Li Youcai" in the Great Production Movement
　　Liǎo Fū
    In the upsurge of the great production movement in the countryside, many "Li Youcais" emerged in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province. They used mountain songs, clappers, doggerel, and rhymes to promote the great production movement.
    Xiong Jinnu, the director of the Xin Xiong Cooperative in Wuxi Township, was unable to lead production through production. The cooperative members wrote a song about him:
    Cooperative members rush to the fields,
    Jinnu sleeps in bed,
    The sun is high in the sky,
    He says it's still early.
    He doesn't do important things,
    He stands and watches light things.
    He eats three meals a day,
    And wanders around Wuxi Street.
    If only Jinnu could stop being crazy,
    We'd willingly give him a pack of cigarettes every day.
    These few short sentences paint a lazy portrait of Xiong Jinnu. The last two lines are a satire of Jinnu, and also express the members' urgent desire for him to change. This song immediately spread. The next day, Jinnu went to work.
    In the Bayi Cooperative of Liantang Township, there was a member named He Laoba, who worked alone but supported nine people. He worked hard in production and had enough to eat, wear, and spare every year. The cooperative members wrote a clapper about him and posted it on the blackboard newspaper.
    Cooperative member He Laoba,
    Has a way with production,
    Goes to work every day,
    And his labor is not bad.
    He gets up early in the dark,
    And accumulates fertilizer well,
    No matter how far the road is,
    He can find it.
    A family of nine,
    All rely on him for labor,
    He works full shifts every day,
    Never slacking off.
    He earns a lot of work points,
    Four thousand nine hundred and eighty,
    More than two hundred in cash,
    And enough grain for the family.
    Reaching affluence,
    The whole family laughs.
    He's been selected,
    As a model in the township.
    These mountain songs and clappers are not only used for praise and criticism within the cooperative, but also between cooperatives. The Houfang Cooperative of Fujia Township visited the Zhongfang Cooperative's production and wrote a clapper to criticize them. The clapper said:
    Zhongfang Agricultural Cooperative,
    Production is not good,
    The pigsty is not repaired,
    The water conservancy is poorly built.
    It used to be a model,
    Why is it like this now?
    They suffered from complacency,
    And ended up collapsing.
    After this clapper was sung, the Zhongfang Cooperative's cadres held a general meeting of all members, took the lead in examining their complacent emotions, and all the members expressed their determination. After the meeting, they immediately took action. In just three days, they made two hundred and forty winter fertilizer cellars, and more than three hundred mu of safflower fields were ditched, drained, and top-dressed. The backwardness of the entire cooperative was quickly changed.
    The County Party Committee's directly affiliated township inspection team inspected the production of Xiaolan Township and found it to be very good, so they also wrote a clapper to praise it. The clapper said:
    The north wind howls,
    Snowflakes fly,
    Xiaolan Cooperative members,
    Shovel grass and carry soil.
    Cleaning up,
    Every household is working.
    One by one,
    They are fiercer than tigers.
    We hope,
    To make it lasting.
    In some places in Nanchang County, in the past, because the work points for accumulating fertilizer were unreasonable, many members were unwilling to sell their household fertilizer to the cooperative. The members described the situation at that time as: "The private plots are over-fertilized and die, while the cooperative's fields are under-fertilized and wither." Later, the cooperative paid attention to solving this problem, mobilized everyone to make cellars in the cooperative's fields, and proposed quality standards and points. The members of the Seventh Cooperative of Wushi Township wrote a song:
    Making private cellars in public fields (referring to the cooperative's fields),
    One zhang and one chi square and high,
    Seventy dan of sod cannot be less,
    Water it thoroughly three times a year.
    If the quality is good,
    Forty work points are guaranteed.
    Make one in each mu of field,
    Next year's increase in production will be reliable.
    In a few words, the quality requirements, points, and purpose and significance of the winter cellar are all sung out. After it spread, a high tide of fertilizer accumulation was quickly set off.
    Most of these songs were composed by the masses themselves, and some were even created collectively. One person would say a sentence, and another would add another, and it would be completed, and it would spread immediately.

　　大生产运动中的“李有才”
　　了夫
    在农村的大生产高潮中，江西南昌县出现了许多“李有才”，他们用山歌、快板、打油诗、顺口溜鼓动了大生产运动。
    武溪乡新雄社社主任熊金牛，不能以生产领导生产，社员给他编了首歌：
    社员田里奔，金牛床上困，
    日头三丈高，他说时间早。
    重事他不干，轻事站着看。
    每日三餐饭，武溪街上串。
    只要金牛能够不发癫，
    每天情愿贴他一包烟。
    只这短短几句，画出了熊金牛一幅懒像。最后两句是对金牛的讽刺，也表达了社员迫切希望他转变的愿望。这首歌即立传开。第二天，金牛上工了。
    莲塘乡八一社有个社员，名叫何老八，一人劳动，九人吃饭，他勤劳生产，年年有吃有穿有剩，社员们给他编了一个快板，登在黑板报上。
    社员何老八，生产有办法，
    每日都上工，劳动也不差。
    摸黑又起早，积肥积得好，
    不论路远近，他能找得到。
    一家人九口，劳动全靠他，
    日日出全工，那回也不蹋。
    工分做得多，四千九百八，
    现金两百多，口粮分到家。
    达到富裕化，全家笑哈哈。
    乡里评模范，已经选上他。
    这些山歌快板不光用在社内的表扬批评上，也用在社与社之间。傅家乡后坊社参观了中坊社的生产，编了一个快板进行批评，快板是：
    中坊农业社，生产不像话，
    猪圈不修整，水利修得差。
    从前是模范，现在为了啥？
    吃了自满亏，结果塌了把。
    这个快板唱出来后，中坊社社干部召开全体社员大会，带头检讨了骄傲自满情绪，全体社员也表示了决心。会后，立即行动，只三天工夫，作了二百四十个冬浆窖，三百多亩红花田进行了开沟排水和追肥，全社落后面貌迅速改变。
    县委直属乡检查组，检查了小蓝乡的生产，觉得很好，也写了个快板表扬。快板是：
    北风呼呼，雪花飞舞，
    小蓝社员，铲草挑土。
    打扫清洁，户户动手。
    一个一个，赛过猛虎。
    我们希望，做到持久。
    南昌县有些地方，过去因为积肥工分不合理，不少社员不肯把家肥卖给社里。社员形容当时的情况是：“肥死自留地，瘦坏社里田”。后来社里注意解决这个问题，动员大家在社里的田里作窖，提出质量标准和分值，吴石乡第七社社员们编了一个歌子：
    公田（指社里的田）里面作私窖，
    方圆一丈一尺高，
    七十担草皮不能少，
    年里饱水翻三道。
    要是质量做得好，
    四十个工分包拿到。
    每亩田里做一个，
    明年增产就牢靠。
    三言两语，把冬窖的质量要求、分值和目的意义全唱出来了。传开以后，积肥高潮很快掀起来了。
    这些歌子绝大部分是群众自己编成的，有的还是集体创作，你一句我一句，一凑就成，而且一下子就传开了。
