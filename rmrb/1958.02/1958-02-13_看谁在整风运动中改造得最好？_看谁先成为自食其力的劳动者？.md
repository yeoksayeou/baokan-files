Who is reforming best in the rectification movement?
Who will be the first to become a self-reliant laborer?
Wang Guangying, Zhu Jisheng, and Zhou Shutao, representing the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles, put forward five guarantees.
Friendly competition with industrial and commercial circles across the country.
We fully agree with and support the reports made to the congress by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now we will make a statement on the issue of the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles accepting socialist transformation.

Handing over the means of production does not mean handing over one's capitalist stance and ideology; we must be determined to carry out thorough transformation.

Since Chairman Mao earnestly taught us in the industrial and commercial sectors that we should recognize the future, understand the laws of social development, and grasp our own destiny, the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles, along with the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, expressed a loud slogan with ten thousand thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao: "Listen to Chairman Mao and always follow the Communist Party." We crossed a major step on the road of accepting socialist transformation by beating gongs and drums to change the ownership of the means of production in 1956. The Party and the government have done a lot of work to enable us to study, work, and accept thorough transformation with peace of mind, such as in clearing assets and determining equity and interest rates, arranging work, improving public-private relations, properly solving the medical problems of private personnel, and organizing study. Many industrial and commercial people have been deeply moved by the Party's meticulous care and concern, and have worked hard to make progress. More and more advanced producers and advanced workers have emerged from the private sector in each season, and many people have seriously studied the socialist management system and basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, and some have been able to control their own destiny as a result. This is a new atmosphere. However, a few people harbor hatred for this, thinking that handing over the means of production makes them fearless. They changed from initially praising to our faces and scolding behind our backs to openly clamoring that "the bourgeoisie and the working class only have the distinction between advanced and backward," "there are no guests among the masters, all are in the socialist sphere," "Marxism-Leninism does not apply in China," "withdraw public representatives," and so on. These reactionary words and deeds that oppose the leadership of the Party and the socialist path, that want to compete with the working class, and that want to overthrow the theoretical foundation of our revolution were heard by many people who felt comfortable and agreeable, and were confused or resonated with them, thus setting off a counter-current of anti-Party and anti-socialism. The slogan we put forward, "Listen to Chairman Mao and always follow the Communist Party," was disrupted by them for a period of time. After the Party sounded the alarm and launched the anti-Rightist struggle, these Rightist elements were all pulled out. After presenting the facts, reasoning, and thoroughly exposing and criticizing them, the hideous faces of the Rightist elements were exposed, and many people gradually woke up. In a mirror of the Rightists, the dark and reactionary side of the vast majority of the industrial and commercial circles was revealed, and most of the industrial and commercial circles realized to varying degrees that they were not wholeheartedly devoted to the Party and socialism, but were of divided mind. They realized that they had not stood firmly on the socialist stand, but had basically not abandoned the capitalist stand. From the large number of revealed facts, they saw the reactionary nature of capitalism, and only then realized the necessity of further accepting thorough transformation, and only then realized that it is impossible to accept transformation and change one's political stance if one only hands over the means of production without handing over one's capitalist stance and ideology, and without treating each other with sincerity and exchanging hearts.

The education we in the industrial and commercial circles have received this year has been extremely profound. We have further seen the decay of capitalism and felt deeply shocked, panicked, and ashamed. Only by summoning up the courage, making a firm determination, and carrying out thorough transformation can we withstand the storms and truly "listen to Chairman Mao and always follow the Communist Party."

Our nation truly has great hope. The national bourgeoisie cannot be content with falling behind and must also strive to move forward.

Since the Soviet Union's two man-made satellites went into the sky and the two declarations of Moscow were announced, it is very clear that the strength of socialism has surpassed the strength of imperialism, and the strength of peace has surpassed the strength of war. The truth pointed out by Chairman Mao that "the East wind prevails over the West wind" is becoming clearer and clearer. Domestically, with the decisive victory of the nationwide rectification, the revolutionary vigor of the people across the country has been boosted. On the industrial front, the backward are catching up with the advanced, and the advanced are moving forward even more, breaking through plans again and again. On the agricultural front, 100 million farmers have invested in water conservancy construction and have completed tens of billions of cubic meters of earthwork. News of great leaps forward is still coming in one after another. This heroic spirit shows that China's socialist revolution, after the change in the ownership of the means of production, has launched a new upsurge of the revolutionary vigor of the people across the country on the basis of great victories on the political and ideological fronts. The people across the country are elated and inspired. Under the encouragement that our nation truly has great hope, how can the patriotic national bourgeoisie be willing to fall behind the situation, and not boost their vigor and strive to move forward!?

We have the leadership and care of the great Chinese Communist Party; since liberation, through the five major movements and three major transformations, our general ideological understanding has been improved to varying degrees; the ownership of the means of production has been changed; many activists and backbone elements have emerged among us, who can also play an active leading and promoting role in our thorough transformation; and the current great upsurge in industrial and agricultural production is encouraging and promoting us. With the leadership of the Party, we are fully capable and able to do a good job in general rectification, so that our political stand can be transformed. Only in this way can we change the incompatible situation that we are far behind the great leap forward on various objective fronts.

From this period of rectification in Tianjin, we have deeply realized that: the more thorough the rectification is, the greater the gains in politics and ideology, and the more energetic we are in the enterprise; and the more energetic we are in the enterprise, the more it promotes progress in politics and ideology. The two promote and combine with each other. Therefore, we must closely rely on the leadership of the Party, fully mobilize the masses, lead by the backbone, and humbly learn from the experience of brother regions. We are confident that we can make the general rectification both in-depth and meticulous, and everyone will make progress.

In order to adapt to the great leap forward on various fronts across the country, we, representing the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles, solemnly guarantee to the National People's Congress:

(1) Actively conduct self-examination and transform our political stance in the general rectification, actively help others, learn from the great movement of great blooming, great contending, big-character posters, and great debates, and criticism and self-criticism, and develop the habit;

(2) On the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, constantly raise vigilance and carry out unremitting struggle against all anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds;

(3) Take the enterprise as the base for transformation, sincerely accept the leadership of the Party committee and public representatives in work practice, accept the supervision of the workers, strive to learn from the workers, actively study the socialist management system, and be consistent in words and deeds, and be dutiful and responsible;

(4) In labor training, abide by labor discipline, establish a labor viewpoint, develop labor habits, learn labor skills, and establish a hard-working and simple lifestyle;

(5) Work hard to study and constantly improve our level of awareness and professional skills politically and ideologically, accelerate our transformation, and become self-reliant laborers within five years or a shorter period.

There are many cities in our country with relatively concentrated capitalist industry and commerce, especially Shanghai and Beijing. In order to make the general rectification in-depth, in order to set off a climax of changing political stances, sincerely and honestly accepting thorough transformation, and to exert all our strength in the great leap forward in production, we are willing to use the guarantees made at the conference as conditions to issue a friendly challenge to the capitalist industrialists and businessmen of brother cities, encourage each other, and make progress together, in order to truly "listen to Chairman Mao and always follow the Communist Party" and resolutely take the socialist road!

    看谁在整风运动中改造得最好？
    看谁先成为自食其力的劳动者？
    王光英　朱继圣　周叔弢三位代表代表天津市工商界提出五项保证
    向全国工商界友谊竞赛
    我们完全同意和拥护李先念副总理，薄一波副总理，彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任向大会所作的报告。现在我们就天津市工商界接受社会主义改造问题做一个发言。
    交出生产资料并不等于交出了自己的资本主义立场和思想，必须下决心进行脱胎换骨的改造。
    自从毛主席谆谆教导我们工商界应该认清前途，认识社会发展规律，掌握自己的命运以后，天津市工商界即随着农业合作化高潮，以万分感激党和毛主席的心情，喊出了一个响亮的口号：“听毛主席的话，永远跟着共产党走。”敲锣打鼓地经过了一九五六年生产资料所有制的改变，在接受社会主义改造的道路上跨进了重要的一步。党和政府为了使我们能够安心学习，安心工作，安心接受彻底的改造，曾在清产核资，定股定息，安排工作，改进公私共事关系，妥善地解决私方人员的疾病医疗问题和组织学习等方面都做了很多工作。很多工商界在党的无微不至的照顾和关怀下，深深受到感动，努力要求进步。私方人员中涌现出一季比一季多的先进生产者和先进工作者，不少人认真地学习社会主义经营管理制度和马列主义基本理论知识，有些因此能够掌握了自己的命运，这是一番新的气象。但是有少数人对此心怀仇恨，自以为交出生产资料即有恃无恐，从初期的当面颂扬，背后骂娘，转到公开的叫嚣什么“资产阶级与工人阶级只有先进与落后的区别了”“同是主人没有客，同在社会主义领域中”“马列主义在中国对不上号”“撤出公方代表”等等。这些反对党的领导和社会主义的道路，要与工人阶级分庭抗礼，和想推翻我们革命的理论基础的反动言行，有不少的人听了反觉得顺耳舒服而受了迷惑或发生了共鸣，从而掀起了一股反党反社会主义的逆流。我们自己所提的“听毛主席的话，永远跟共产党走”的口号，被他们搅得在一个时期不那末听得到了。经过党敲响了警钟，开展了反右派斗争，这些右派分子一个个被揪了出来，经过摆事实，讲道理，彻底揭露，彻底批判，右派分子的狰狞面貌被揭穿了，很多人才逐步清醒过来。在一面右派镜子中照清了工商界绝大多数身上的阴暗反动的一面，大多数工商界才不同程度地认识到自己对党对社会主义不是什么一心一意而是三心二意，不是站稳了什么社会主义立场而是基本上没有抛弃资本主义立场。从大量揭露出来的事实中看到了资本主义的反动性，才认识到有进一步接受脱胎换骨本质改造的必要性，才认识到只交出生产资料而不交出自己的资本主义立场和思想来，不以诚相见以心换心是根本没法接受改造和改变政治立场的。
    我们工商界这一年来所受的教育，是极其深刻的，进一步看清了资本主义的腐朽，深深感到惊心动魄，慌愧不安，只有鼓起勇气，痛下决心，进行脱胎换骨的改造，才能经得起风浪，才能真正“听毛主席的话，永远跟着共产党走”。
    我们的民族实实在在大有希望。民族资产阶级不能自甘落后，也要力争上游。
    自从苏联的两颗人造卫星上了天，莫斯科两个宣言的公布，很明显地，社会主义的力量胜过了帝国主义的力量，和平的力量胜过了战争的力量，毛主席所指出的真理“东风压倒西风”，是越看越清楚了。从国内来说，随着全民整风取得了决定性的胜利，全国人民的革命干劲鼓起来了。在工业战线上后进追先进，先进更前进，一而再，再而三突破计划，在农业战线上，一亿农民投入了水利建设，至今已完成了几十亿土方的工程，跃进的消息还接踵传来。这种英雄豪迈的气概，显示出我国社会主义革命，在生产资料所有制改变后而又获得了政治战线和思想战线上伟大胜利的基础上，掀起了全国人民革命干劲的新高涨。全国人民心花怒放，精神奋发，在我们的民族实实在在大有希望的鼓舞下，难道爱国的民族资产阶级就甘心落在形势后面，而不鼓起干劲，力争上游！？
    我们有伟大的中国共产党的领导和关怀；解放以来，经过五大运动，三大改造，我们一般的思想认识都有了不同程度的提高；生产资料所有制已经变革；在我们中间涌现了不少积极分子，骨干分子，对我们进行彻底改造也可以起积极带头和推动作用；当前工农业的生产大高涨正在鼓舞和推动我们，有党的领导，我们完全有条件有可能把一般整风做好，使我们的政治立场得到改造。这样才能改变我们大大落后于客观上各个战线大跃进这个不适应的局面。
    从天津这一段整风我们已经深深体会到：整风进行的越彻底，政治上思想上收获越大，在企业里干劲越足；而在企业里干劲越足，又推动了政治上思想上的进步，二者是相互推动，相互结合的。因此我们一定密切依靠党的领导，充分发动群众，领导骨干带头，虚心吸取兄弟地区经验，我们是有信心把一般整风做到既深入又细致，人人得到进步的。
    为了适应全国各个战线的大跃进，我们代表天津市工商界向庄严的全国人民代表大会提出保证：
    （1）在一般整风中积极进行自我检查，改造自己的政治立场，积极帮助别人，在这伟大运动中学会大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论和批评自我批评，并养成习惯；
    （2）在反右派斗争胜利基础上，经常提高警惕，同一切反党反社会主义的言行进行不懈的斗争；
    （3）以企业为改造基地，在工作实践中真心诚意地接受党委和公方代表的领导，接受工人的监督，努力向工人群众学习，积极学习社会主义经营管理制度，作到言行一致，守职尽责；
    （4）在劳动锻炼中，遵守劳动纪律，树立劳动观点，养成劳动习惯，学会劳动本领，建立艰苦朴素的生活作风；
    （5）努力学习，从政治上思想上不断提高自己的觉悟水平和业务水平，加速改造自己，要在五年内或较短的时期，人人成为自食其力的劳动者。
    我们国内有不少资本主义工商业比较集中的城市，特别是上海和北京，为了使一般整风进行的深透，为了掀起一个改变政治立场、诚诚恳恳、老老实实、接受脱胎换骨本质改造的高潮，在生产大跃进中发挥我们一切力量，我们愿以在大会上所提出的保证做为条件向各兄弟城市的资本主义工商业者提出友谊挑战，互相勉励，共同进步，为真正做到“听毛主席的话，永远跟着共产党走”，坚决走社会主义道路而奋斗！
