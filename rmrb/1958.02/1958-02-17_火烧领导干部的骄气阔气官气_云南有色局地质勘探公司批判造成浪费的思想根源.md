Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 16th: The Yunnan Nonferrous Metals Bureau Geological Exploration Company has serious waste problems. Due to the arrogance, complacency, and fondness for grandiose projects on the part of leading cadres, as well as their preference for the new and aversion to the old, the company accumulated and wasted machinery and materials worth more than 14 million yuan during the First Five-Year Plan. It is now undergoing rectification based on the opinions of the workers and staff.

According to materials revealed during the rectification and airing of views, the most prominent problem is the waste caused by geological designs that disregarded regulations and relied solely on subjective assumptions and blind construction. Some leading cadres of this company were greedy for more investment and engineering work, wanting to secure one-third of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's national geological exploration investment, striving for the title of "Large Company." Therefore, they launched large-scale projects in some mining areas with unclear resources and uncertain prospects, resulting in significant losses.

Under the influence of some cadres' preference for the new and aversion to the old, and their belief that "only foreign goods are good," many machines and equipment were stockpiled in warehouses. Some people believed that domestically produced hydraulic drilling rigs were not the latest models and refused to use them. As a result, 32 domestically produced hydraulic drilling rigs transferred from Anshan were piled up in warehouses, except for four that were in use. One big-character poster revealed the situation of machines stockpiled in another small warehouse, and then calculated an account: the value of these machines could buy two million jin of high-quality white rice. The big-character poster called out: quickly put these things to use.

In order to decorate the facade of a large company and emphasize the grandeur of a large company, the company’s administrative management was even more extravagant and wasteful. Some leading comrades had the view that "a large company should carry out large-scale construction every year to feel energetic." Some buildings that had little to do with production were renovated and rebuilt year after year. The company bought cars every year, to the point that there were more public cars than could be used. The company's bicycles were basically sufficient, but the administrative section used the names of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Geological Bureau to purchase seventeen more. Every cadre above the section level was issued one or two vehicles, regardless of whether they could ride them or not. The head of the Labor and Wages Section, who could not ride himself, also took one home for his children to ride. They also tried their best to pursue the so-called "style of a large company" in their lives. The nursery school even spent more than 3,800 yuan to build a bakery. They also used refractory bricks costing more than ten yuan each to build a cooking stove, spending more than 6,700 yuan.

Recently, the company held a meeting to criticize the arrogance, complacency, and fondness for grandiose projects of the leading cadres. The former company manager, Wu Zhiyuan, made a self-criticism at the meeting, saying that he would definitely correct his mistakes. A high tide of anti-waste, with leading cadres personally taking the lead, is now forming. This year, the company's production plan has been revised, and the workers and staff guarantee to overfulfill the state-stipulated mineral exploration tasks while reducing investment by one-fifth. They will also learn from past lessons and vigorously reduce blindly arranged engineering work. Each exploration team will try to make use of the machines in the warehouse and support each other. The company's administrative departments will also try to reduce administrative expenses, and each exploration team will use tents and bamboo sheds in areas with uncertain prospects.

### 火烧领导干部的骄气阔气官气  云南有色局地质勘探公司批判造成浪费的思想根源

    火烧领导干部的骄气阔气官气
    云南有色局地质勘探公司批判造成浪费的思想根源
    本报特约新华社昆明16日电　云南有色金属管理局地质勘探公司浪费严重。这个公司由于领导干部骄傲自满、好大喜功、喜新厌旧，第一个五年计划期间积压浪费了价值一千四百多万元的机器和物资，现在正根据职工群众的意见进行整改。
    据在整改鸣放中揭发出来的材料，最突出的是在地质设计上，不遵守规程，仅凭主观臆断，盲目摆设工程造成的浪费。这个公司的部分领导干部在投资和工程量上都贪多求大，想把冶金工业部在全国的地质勘探投资争来三分之一，力争“大公司”称号。因此在一些资源不清远景不明的矿区，大摆工程，造成很大损失。
    在部分干部喜新厌旧，“非外国货不用”的思想影响下，仓库里积压着许多机器设备。有些人认为国产的油压钻机不是最新式的，拒绝使用。因此远从鞍山调来的三十二台国产油压钻机除四台外，其它都堆在仓库里。有一张大字报揭露了另一个小仓库积压机器的情况后，算了一笔账：这些机器的价值可买二百万斤上等白米。这张大字报呼吁道：赶快把这些东西利用起来。
    为了要装璜大公司门面，讲究大公司气派，这个公司在行政管理上，铺张浪费，奢侈挥霍的现象更为严重。部分领导同志有“大公司应该年年大兴土木才得劲儿”的看法。一些同生产关系不大的楼房，年年修了又修，盖了又盖。这个公司年年买小轿车，以至公用的小车用不完。公司的自行车本来基本够用，行政科又用冶金工业部和地质分局的名义套购十七辆。每个处以上的干部不管会不会骑都发了一辆或二辆。劳动工资处处长自己不会，也领一辆拖回家去给孩子骑。他们在生活上又尽力追求所谓“大公司派头”。托儿所竟用三千八百多元盖了一间面包房。还用十多元一块的耐火砖砌了一眼烧饭的灶，花了六千七百多元。
    最近，这个公司开会批判了领导干部骄傲自满、好大喜功的思想。前公司经理吴志远在会上作了检查，表示一定改正错误。现在领导干部亲自引火烧身的反浪费高潮正在形成。今年全公司的生产计划已经作了修订，职工们保证在减少五分之一投资的情况下，超额完成国家规定的矿量勘探任务。他们还要吸收过去的教训，大力削减盲目摆设的工程量。各勘探队都将尽量利用仓库里的机器，互相支援。公司行政部门也尽量减少行政费用，各勘探队在远景不明的地区都改用帐篷，竹篷。
