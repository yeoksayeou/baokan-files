    The Green Great Wall
    Farmers in the Bohuo Peninsula of Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, are building a shelterbelt on the beach - the Bohuo Shelterbelt. In just two or three years, they have turned more than 20 miles of beach into a green Great Wall. Now, the trees, which are two or three zhang high, have controlled wind and sand, enabling most of the more than 20 agricultural cooperatives within the shelterbelt to increase production.

    绿色长城
    广东电白县博贺半岛的农民在海滩上营造防护林带——博贺林带，只两三年间，便把二十多里长的海滩变成了绿色的长城。现在，二、三丈高的林木，制服了风沙，使林带内二十多个农业社大部分获得增产。　赵慕志摄（南方日报供稿）
