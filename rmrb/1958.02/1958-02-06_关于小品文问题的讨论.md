　　Discussion on the Issue of Familiar Essays
　　Shān Bǎi

　　Last April, the supplement of the "People's Daily" launched a discussion on the issue of familiar essays. As the editor's note of the supplement on November 26th stated, the handling of this discussion at that time was erroneous, mainly because it did not clearly see the crux of the familiar essay issue, and did not promptly expose and refute the bourgeois rightist fallacies and anti-Marxist literary viewpoints in some articles. Originally, differing opinions on the familiar essay issue were necessary, but after many opinions were published, there was no appropriate summary, and therefore no direction was pointed out, and the influence of erroneous thinking was not clarified, which was wrong.

　　This discussion was triggered by Xu Maoyong's "The New Crisis of Familiar Essays." This was an insidious and inflammatory article. The framing of the issue itself was wrong. As a weapon of criticism, familiar essays can be used to deal with enemies, and they can also be used to deal with the people themselves. Familiar essays that criticize shortcomings within the people are aimed at the interests of the people and the interests of the socialist cause. How can such familiar essays face a "crisis of extinction" in a socialist society? Of course, familiar essays aimed at sabotaging the socialist cause will inevitably encounter a "crisis of extinction," and will certainly perish. But Xu Maoyong's question was not posed in this way at all. He did not want to guide the discussion to the question of how to make familiar essays better serve the people and the socialist cause. He did not think that the author needed to consider his own position, attitude, viewpoint, and method at all, but instead blamed the social environment. Xu Maoyong used oblique insinuations to imply that the reason why familiar essays became a problem was because our society was oppressing familiar essays and suppressing criticism. Although he did not directly say that the new society was undemocratic and had no freedom of speech, this was precisely the impression given to readers by the article. Another rightist element, Zeng Yanshou, who had not yet revealed his true colors at that time, wrote a response under the pen name Yan Xiu, participating in the discussion, and revealed Xu Maoyong's secret, saying that Xu Maoyong was actually accusing the new society of "lack of freedom of speech."

　　Carrying out criticism and self-criticism within the people, whether by using familiar essays or other methods, is not impossible to encounter resistance. Bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism are obstacles. Therefore, the Party called for rectification to make those who are criticized more open-minded and humble, and to make them learn to accept criticism and improve their work. However, our fundamental difference with those represented by Xu Maoyong is: we believe that the socialist system guarantees the working people genuine democracy and freedom, and socialist democracy is expanding daily. The socialist system promotes criticism and self-criticism, including various forms of solemn and sharp criticism. The working class and its political party are not afraid of criticism, do not allow the phenomenon of suppressing criticism, and support the struggle against various bad phenomena. Only the declining and reactionary classes are afraid of and suppress social opinion and mass criticism. But what about Xu Maoyong and his ilk? They implied that the Communist Party and the People's Government were suppressing democracy and depriving freedom, just like the reactionaries. This slander has long been refuted by life itself. During the rectification movement, the blooming and contending, the big debates, and the big-character posters that appeared everywhere fully demonstrated the vitality and superiority of socialist democracy. Secondly, we believe that if there is a "crisis" of familiar essays, the fundamental reason is that the authors of familiar essays and their works themselves have problems. Their criticisms are mixed with hidden arrows and cynicism aimed at the cause of the working people, lacking enthusiasm for cherishing the new society, but filled with malice to uglify the proletariat, the Communist Party, and the People's Government. Familiar essay is just a literary form, the problem lies in the content. If the content is unhealthy and poisonous, how can you blame others' counter-criticism? However, Xu Maoyong and his ilk believed that the problem lies in the society's "undemocratic" and "lack of freedom", therefore, they shouted about the so-called crisis of familiar essays, and used a defensive posture to attack socialism. In their opinion, the familiar essay author's position of standing outside the Party and outside the people, that detached cynicism, even an attitude of hostility towards the people, should not be changed, and is not allowed to be changed. Familiar essays can depart from the desire for unity and aim at achieving unity, and familiar essays cannot be bound by the principles of internal criticism of the people. They also believe that familiar essay authors have the privilege to leave the Party's literary line, can not transform their thinking, can ignore the question of stance or position, and can charge around wildly. When familiar essays with shortcomings and errors are criticized, they think this is discrimination against all familiar essays, as if this kind of literary style is particularly destroyed by the new society. Following Xu Maoyong, many articles participating in the discussion revealed this kind of thought and emotion to varying degrees.

　　Only a few of the discussion articles, although not directly disagreeing with Xu Maoyong, at least expressed that the reasons why some familiar essays became a problem were not all in the objective environment, but also in the subjective aspect of the authors. A few articles also mentioned the need to "avoid the fault of one-sidedness" and mentioned the issue of the author's position, which was good. However, in general, they were not raised clearly and forcefully enough, and did not stand on a principled position to expose and criticize Xu Maoyong's anti-socialist arguments. On the contrary, some authors developed along Xu Maoyong's words. On the one hand, they affirmed that familiar essays were facing a crisis of "survival" or "abolition" because familiar essays were "discriminated against"; on the other hand, they one-sidedly emphasized exposing the dark side of real life, saying that this was the "new creative requirement" of the current literary and art circles, and believed that the only condition needed for authors to do this was to be "bold," and completely ignored the issue of position and attitude. Some authors insisted on using "potent and side-effect drugs," without mentioning the fundamental difference between criticism of the enemy and criticism of the people. There were also people who said that all "rules and regulations" must be abolished for familiar essays, and it seemed that the socialist literary and art policy, the popular, class, and party nature of literature and art should also be abolished as "rules and regulations."

　　What is particularly worth mentioning is Fan Zhou's article "I Say Familiar Essays Are Going to Die Out." He sang a different tune, on the surface, not a single word attacked socialism, not a bit of gunpowder, but pretended to be firm, well-versed in policy, and advised familiar essay authors to be aware of the situation as soon as possible and simply stop. He attempted to stimulate familiar essay authors with sarcastic remarks.

　　He first affirmed the various reasons for the "persecution" of familiar essays mentioned by Xu Maoyong, saying that they "are fundamentally unsolvable." Then he arbitrarily said that familiar essays are satire, and criticism within the people does not allow satire. Finally, he said: "With familiar essays, there is a lot of unpleasantness and many abuses; without them, it is beneficial to unity and does not hurt feelings." When others shouted that the new society was "undemocratic" and must be resisted, Fan Zhou said that this "is fundamentally unsolvable," so don't have any extravagant hopes. What does this mean?

　　Not only that, Fan Zhou even distortedly quoted Mao Zedong's words in the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" to prove that we do not allow satire to be used within the people. The "Talks" clearly wrote that "defects of the people must be criticized" and "satire is always needed," but Fan Zhou pretended not to see it. He insisted that, because "Lu Xun's essays were aimed at the enemies of the people, he 'never ridiculed and attacked the revolutionary people and the revolutionary party' (Mao Zedong's words). Therefore, our current familiar essays rarely fight against the enemy and mostly satirize our own people, which may not be a temporary mistake, but a fundamental error in direction."

　　Yes, Chairman Mao warned essay authors not to misuse satire, to distinguish targets, to distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, to have a correct position and attitude, and to have different satire for the enemy and for ourselves. This is completely correct, and this is what every revolutionary writer should use to demand of himself. Can we use the ridicule and attacks against the enemies of the people to turn around and deal with the people themselves? Why shouldn't we oppose essays that treat the people as enemies and strike and satirize them? Why don't we have the right and freedom to protect the people from hostile attacks? However, in the view of Fan Zhou and his ilk, if the people demand such rights and freedoms, it is hindering the rights and freedoms of familiar essay authors, that is, only allowing satire against the enemy and not allowing satire against shortcomings within the people. He quoted Chairman Mao's words, made a distorted extension, and made it seem as if Chairman Mao also opposed using essays to criticize shortcomings within the people. Such fabrication is a bit too clumsy.

　　Xu Maoyong clamored for "lack of freedom of speech" and wanted to "sacrifice himself for justice" to "fight for democracy," while Fan Zhou asserted that "familiar essays are going to die out" and called on writers to strike; Xu Maoyong hoped that anti-Party familiar essays would be "fast, good, and economical," while Fan Zhou slandered that under the people's regime, being able to speak freely is "dreaming of picking up gold!" Fan Zhou even uglyfied the new society as a society that cuts off channels for speech, does not allow criticism, and is unreasonable. Isn't this instigating people to oppose socialism?

　　However, such a bad article was not exposed. This discussion on the issue of familiar essays allowed the anti-socialist remarks of bourgeois elements to circulate in the market without being promptly countered.

　　Chairman Mao's speech fifteen years ago was a criticism of the then-popular reactionary and petty-bourgeois erroneous literary and artistic ideas. Chairman Mao refuted the fallacy of "it is still the era of essays, and Lu Xun's style is still needed," raised the issue that literary and artists must transform their thinking and correct their positions, and opened up a new era of the socialist literary and artistic direction. Fifteen years later, when history is undergoing a new turning point, when a fierce socialist revolution is taking place in the ideological field, when the Party is once again calling for rectification, when the anti-communist tide and revisionist literary and artistic ideas in imperialist countries were once rampant, the reactionary literary and artistic ideas representing the bourgeois rightists took the opportunity to raise their heads. They were promptly warned. In mid-March 1957, Chairman Mao gave a speech at the National Propaganda Conference, specifically mentioning the issue of essays. He said that essays are needed, and the one-sidedness of essays is unavoidable, but it is possible and should be required to overcome the one-sidedness of essay authors, and it is possible and should be required that writers gradually learn to use dialectics to look at problems. He also said that essays can have sharp satire, but of course they cannot stand on a hostile position and treat comrades with the attitude of enemies. Regarding the environmental issue, Chairman Mao pointed out that creation needs a suitable environment, needs rectification, but the current environment is definitely better than the past. All writers who are determined to reform and are determined to serve the people do not need to be afraid.

　　However, Xu Maoyong and his ilk could not accept these admonitions. They insisted that the one-sidedness of their essays cannot be changed, that criticism and satire can be indiscriminate between ourselves and the enemy, and even shouted that the new society is "undemocratic" and that all "rules and regulations" on literary and artistic creation should be abolished. They re-picked up the bankrupt supra-class literary and artistic theory to oppose the Party's literary and artistic policy.

　　Only by repelling this countercurrent of the anti-Marxist literary and artistic line can our essays, that is, familiar essays, which "truly stand on the position of the people and speak with full enthusiasm to protect the people and educate the people," develop smoothly. We must defend essays and not allow anti-socialist elements to use them as weapons against the Party and the people!

　　关于小品文问题的讨论
　　山柏
    去年4月间“人民日报”副刊上开展了一次关于小品文问题的讨论。正如11月26日副刊编者按语所说，当时对这一讨论的处理是有错误的，主要是没有清醒地看出小品文问题的关键所在，对于有些文章中的资产阶级右派谬论和反马克思主义的文艺观点，没有及时地加以揭露和驳斥。本来，关于小品文的问题，不同意见的争论是必要的，但是在发表了许多意见之后，没有适当地进行总结，因此也就没有指明方向，廓清错误思想的影响，这就不对了。
    这一讨论是由徐懋庸的“小品文的新危机”一文引起的。这是一篇阴险的、有煽动性的文章。问题的提法本身就是错误的。作为批评的武器，小品文可以用来对待敌人，也可以用来对人民自己。批评人民内部缺点的小品文，它的目的是为了人民的利益，社会主义事业的利益。这样的小品文在社会主义社会里怎么会发生“消亡的危机”呢？当然，目的在于破坏社会主义事业的小品文就定然要遇到“消亡的危机”，而且定然要消亡。但是徐懋庸的问题却完全不是这样提出的，他丝毫也不想把讨论引导到怎样使小品文更好地为人民服务、为社会主义事业服务这个问题上去，完全不认为作者有必要考虑自己的立场、态度、观点、方法问题，而是一味地责备社会环境。徐懋庸用曲笔暗示小品文之所以成为问题，是由于我们的社会是压迫小品文的，是压制批评的。他虽则没有直捷了当地说新社会不民主，没有言论自由，但是，文章所给予读者的印象正是这样。另一个在当时也还没有暴露真面目的右派分子曾彦修，用严秀的笔名写了一篇响应的文章，参加讨论，就泄露了徐懋庸的秘密，说徐懋庸实际上是指责新社会“言论不自由”。
    在人民内部开展批评和自我批评，不管是采用小品文还是别的方式，也并不是不可能碰到阻力。官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义等就是障碍，因此党号召整风，使被批评者虚心一些，谦逊一些，使他们学得善于接受批评，改进工作。但是，我们和以徐懋庸为代表的那些人的根本分歧是：我们认为社会主义制度保证劳动人民享有真正的民主和自由，社会主义民主日益扩大。社会主义制度是提倡批评和自我批评的，包括各种形式的严正的尖锐的批评。工人阶级及其政党是不怕批评的，是不容许有压制批评的现象的，是支持同各种坏现象作斗争的，只有没落的反动的阶级才害怕和压制社会舆论、群众批评。但是徐懋庸他们怎样呢？他们暗示共产党、人民政府和反动派一样，是在压制民主，剥夺自由。这种诬蔑早已被生活本身所驳斥。在整风运动中，到处出现大鸣大放大辩论大字报，充分说明了社会主义民主的生命力和优越性。其次，我们认为，如果要说小品文有“危机”的话，其根本原因是小品文作者和他们的作品本身有问题。他们的批评中夹杂着针对劳动人民事业的暗箭和冷嘲，缺乏爱护新社会的热情，倒是充满了丑化无产阶级、共产党和人民政府的恶意。小品文只是一种文学形式，问题是在于内容。如果内容不健康，有毒害，怎么能怪别人的反批评呢？但是，徐懋庸他们认为问题是在于社会“不民主”、“不自由”，因此大嚷其所谓小品文的危机，用防御的姿态向社会主义进攻。在他们看来，小品文作者的那种自外于党、自外于人民的立场，那种事不关己的冷嘲态度，甚至敌视人民的态度，是不应该改变、不允许改变的，小品文是可以不从团结的愿望出发并以达到团结为目的的，小品文是不能够接受人民内部批评的原则的约束的。他们还认为小品文作者有特权可以离开党的文艺路线，可以不改造自己的思想，可以不理睬什么立场不立场的问题，可以横冲直撞，乱轰一气。当有缺点和错误的小品文受到批评时，他们就认为这是对一切小品文的歧视，仿佛这一种文学样式是特别受到新社会摧残的。继徐懋庸之后，参加讨论的不少文章都在不同程度上流露了这种思想情绪。
    讨论文章中只有少数虽则没有针锋相对地对徐懋庸表示异议，至少还表示了某些小品文之所以成为问题，原因并不都在客观环境方面，也在作者主观方面。个别的文章还提到了需要“避免片面性的毛病”，提到了作者的立场问题，这是好的。但是，一般都提得不够鲜明有力，没有站在原则立场上来对徐懋庸的反社会主义的论点加以揭露和批判。相反地，有的作者还顺着徐懋庸的话加以发挥。一面肯定小品文面临“存”“废”的危机，因为小品文受到“歧视”；一面片面地强调揭露现实生活阴暗面，说这是当前文艺界的“新的创作要求”，而且认为作者这样做的时候，所需要的唯一条件是“大胆”，而完全忽略了立场态度问题。有的作者坚持要用“烈性而有副作用的药”，完全不提对敌人的批评和对人民的批评的根本区别。还有的人说，对小品文必须废除一切“清规戒律”，似乎社会主义文艺方针，文艺的人民性、阶级性和党性也都应该作为“清规戒律”而加以废除了。
    值得特别一提的，是范舟的一篇“我说小品文要消亡”。他唱的是另一个调子，表面上没有一句话攻击社会主义，没有一点儿火药气，倒是装出一副立场坚定、熟谙政策的姿态，劝小品文作者趁早识相，干脆歇手。他企图用反话来刺激小品文作者。
    他首先肯定徐懋庸所说的小品文“受迫害”的种种原因，“是根本无法解决的”。接着武断地说，小品文就是讽刺，而人民内部的批评是不容许讽刺的。最后说：“有了小品文，有伤和气，流弊甚多；没有，反倒有利团结，不伤感情。”当别的人叫喊新社会“不民主”、必须反抗的时候，范舟却说，这“是根本无法解决的”，趁早不要存什么奢望。这是什么意思？
    不仅如此，范舟竟然还歪曲地引用了毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中的话，来证明我们不容许在人民内部运用讽刺。“讲话”中明明写着“对于人民的缺点是需要批评的”，“讽刺是永远需要的”，范舟却装作没有看见。他硬说，由于“鲁迅的杂文就是对付人民的敌人的，他就‘不曾嘲笑和攻击革命人民和革命政党’（毛主席语）。因此，我们现在的小品文很少对敌作战，多是对人民自己的讽刺，恐非一时之误，而是根本方向的错误。”
    是的，毛主席告诫杂文作者不要乱用讽刺，要区别对象，分清敌我，要有正确的立场态度，对敌、对我要有不同的讽刺。这是完全正确的，这是每一个革命作家所应该用来要求于自己的。难道我们可以用对付人民的敌人的嘲笑和攻击，转而用来对付人民自己吗？我们为什么不应该反对那种把人民当作敌人来打击和讽刺的杂文呢？为什么我们没有保护人民不受敌对的攻击的权利和自由呢？但是，在范舟这些人看来，如果人民要求这样的权利和自由，就是妨碍了小品文作者们的权利和自由，就是只准对敌人进行讽刺，不准对人民内部的缺点进行讽刺。他引用了毛主席的话，加以歪曲的引申，把毛主席也仿佛说成是反对用杂文来批评人民内部缺点似的。这样的?造未免过于拙劣了。
    徐懋庸叫嚣“言论不自由”，要以“杀身成仁”的精神来“争民主”，范舟则断言“小品文要消亡”，号召作家们罢工；徐懋庸指望反党的小品文“又快又好又省”，范舟则诬蔑说在人民政权之下，言论而能够自由是“梦拾黄金！”范舟竟然把新社会丑化为断绝言路、不准批评、无可理喻的社会，这难道不是唆使人们反对社会主义吗？
    但是，就像这样一篇很坏的文章也没有受到揭穿。这一次关于小品文问题的讨论就这样让资产阶级分子的反社会主义的言论流行市场，而没有受到及时的反击。
    毛主席在十五年前的讲话是针对当时流行的反动的、小资产阶级的错误文艺思想的批判。毛主席驳斥了那种“还是杂文时代，还要鲁迅笔法”的谬论，提出了文艺家必须改造思想、端正立场的问题，开辟了社会主义文艺方向的新时代。十五年后，当历史经历着新的转折，在思想领域内进行着激烈的社会主义革命的时候，当党再一次号召整风的时候，当帝国主义国家的反共潮流和修正主义文艺思想一度猖獗的时候，代表资产阶级右派的反动文艺思想乘机抬头。他们是及时地受到了警告的。1957年3月中，毛主席在全国宣传会议上讲了话，特别提到杂文问题。他说，杂文是需要的，杂文的片面性固然难免，但是可以而且应该要求克服杂文作者的片面性，可以而且应该要求作家逐渐学会用辩证法看问题。又说，杂文可以有锐尖的讽刺，但是当然不能站在敌对的立场上用对敌人的态度来对同志。关于环境问题，毛主席指出，创作需要适宜的环境，需要整风，但是现在的环境肯定比过去好，凡是立志改革、存心为人民服务的作家，是用不着害怕的。
    但是徐懋庸之流是不可能接受这些告诫的。他们坚持认为他们的杂文的片面性不能改变，批评和讽刺可以不分敌我对象，甚至高呼新社会“不民主”，要废除文艺创作上的一切“清规戒律”。他们重新拾起了破产的超阶级的文艺理论来与党的文艺方针相对立。
    只有打退这一反马克思主义文艺路线的逆流，我们的“真正站在人民的立场上，用保护人民、教育人民的满腔热情来说话”的杂文即小品文，才能够顺利发展。我们必须保卫杂文，不许反社会主义分子利用它作为反党反人民的武器！
