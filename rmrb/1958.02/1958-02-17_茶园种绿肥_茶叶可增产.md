    Tea Garden Green Manure Planting Can Increase Tea Production
    The Jingping Agricultural Cooperative in Qiuyuan Township, Linqi District, Chun'an County, famous for its "fried green" tea, has been planting green manure in its tea gardens, resulting in annual increases in tea production. The yield per unit area has increased from 58.5 jin in 1954 to 110.5 jin in 1957. In 1955, while the county's tea production decreased by 6.1%, the cooperative's production increased by 43% compared to 1954.
    More than 80% of the Jingping Agricultural Cooperative's tea gardens are located in high mountains. Since 1954, they have adopted the practice of planting green manure in remote mountain tea gardens and applying soil fertilizer in tea gardens near villages. Every wheat season, they intercrop adzuki beans in the remote mountain tea gardens, and in autumn, they turn and bury the tender stems and leaves of the adzuki beans in situ as green manure. In 1955, the area intercropped with adzuki beans for green manure accounted for one-quarter of the cooperative's total tea garden area. In 1956, the area intercropped with adzuki beans for green manure was expanded to one-half.
    The benefits of planting adzuki beans as green manure in tea gardens are: low cost and labor saving; high fertility and high yield; ability to conserve water and soil; ability to improve the soil; ability to resist drought and prevent frost; and promotion of timely cultivation and weeding by cooperative members. For example, the cost of planting adzuki bean green manure per mu is only about three yuan, while the effect of the green manure produced is equivalent to about thirty jin of chemical fertilizer, worth more than five yuan, reducing the cost by 40% (excluding the labor cost of applying chemical fertilizer).
    This successful experience of the cooperative proves that promoting green manure crops up the mountains in the future is an important direction for solving the current fertilizer shortage in tea gardens and is worthy of promotion.

    茶园种绿肥　茶叶可增产
    以盛产“炒青”著名的淳安县临歧区秋源乡井坪农业社，在茶园内种植绿肥，使茶叶产量年年增加，单位面积产量由1954年的五十八斤半，提高到1957年一百一十斤半；1955年全县茶叶减产6.1％，而该社比1954年增产43％。
    井坪农业社的茶园80％以上是在高山，从1954年起采取了远山茶园种绿肥，近村茶园施土肥的做法。每年麦季在远山茶园内间作赤豆，秋季把赤豆嫩茎叶就地翻埋作绿肥。1955年间种赤豆作绿肥的面积占该社茶园总面积的四分之一，1956年间作绿肥的赤豆面积扩大至二分之一。
    茶园种植赤豆作绿肥的好处是：成本低花工省；肥力大产量高；能保持水土；能改良土壤；既能抗旱又能防冻；促进社员及时中耕除草。例如：每亩种植赤豆绿肥的成本只需三元左右，而所产绿肥效果能抵三十斤左右化学肥料，价值五元多，成本降低了40％（化肥施肥工尚不在内）。
    该社这一成功经验证明，今后推广绿肥作物上山，是解决目前茶园肥料不足的一个重要方向，值得推广。
