Dear Premier Kim Il Sung,
Dear Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, Kim Yong-jin,
Dear Comrades and Friends:
    We are very happy to have the opportunity today to meet with representatives from all walks of life in Pyongyang, the democratic capital of Korea. Thank you for your friendly, warm, and grand welcome. Entrusted by the Chinese people, I extend warm greetings and high respect to you and all the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    Pyongyang has a long history and an excellent cultural tradition. In its 1,530 years of history, it has been filled with many admirable heroic deeds. During the Fatherland Liberation War against American aggression, the people of Pyongyang, under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Republic's government, and Premier Kim Il Sung, made glorious contributions, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of all the people of democratic Korea. The inhuman American aggressors turned Pyongyang into a scorched earth, taking countless precious lives. However, Pyongyang did not succumb. The people of Pyongyang stood firm, fought bravely alongside the Korean people, and finally achieved a great victory in the struggle against American imperialism. Today, Pyongyang has become more beautiful and magnificent. This is the glory of the people of Pyongyang and the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The heroic city of Pyongyang symbolizes the victory of the Korean people, symbolizes the Korean people's indomitable fighting will, and symbolizes the invincible strength of the Korean people!
    The three-year war brought severe destruction and unprecedentedly enormous losses to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. However, the Korean people did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. Under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Republic's government, and Premier Kim Il Sung, you have overcome various difficulties with the same heroic spirit and selfless labor enthusiasm, engaging in the enormous task of recovery and construction. In just over four years, you have not only successfully completed the post-war three-year economic plan, but also overfulfilled the first year of the first five-year plan for the people's economy. The serious wounds of war have been basically healed, the major sectors of the national economy have greatly exceeded the pre-war 1949 levels, cultural and educational undertakings have developed accordingly, and the people's living standards have continuously improved. Your arduous labor has won the sympathy and admiration of all progressive forces in the world and has received warm support from socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union. Your great achievements powerfully prove the incomparable superiority of the socialist system established in the northern half of your country.
    The Chinese people celebrate and cheer for every achievement of the Korean people. The Chinese people are deeply proud to have such hardworking and brave brothers and comrades-in-arms as the Korean people. The strong will and hard work demonstrated by the Korean people in the anti-aggression struggle and in peaceful construction are examples that the Chinese people often learn from. The Chinese government delegation has come to Korea this time to further learn from this noble quality of the Korean people through practical visits and observations.
    The people of China and Korea have a profound traditional friendship. Our friendship has been consolidated and developed in the long struggle against common enemies. Therefore, this friendship is praised by our two peoples as a friendship cemented in blood. In the past, during the Chinese people's successive domestic revolutionary wars and the Anti-Japanese War, outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people sacrificed their lives to support the Chinese people. In the Fatherland Liberation War against American aggression, the Korean people defended the independence of their own country on the one hand, and also ensured China's security, providing significant support for the Chinese people's peaceful construction. The Chinese People's Volunteers received warm support and meticulous care from the Korean people and the Korean government during the period of resisting American aggression together with the Korean people and in the post-war period of assisting the Korean people in maintaining the armistice and rebuilding their homes. The Korean people not only tightened their belts to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, but even sacrificed their own lives to rescue the Chinese People's Volunteers, like the Korean internationalist fighter Park Jae-geun. These touching deeds fully embody the brotherly relationship between the people of China and Korea, and fully embody the noble internationalist spirit of the Korean people. All of these are forever unforgettable and endlessly appreciated by the Chinese people.
    In recent years, the friendly unity between the people of China and Korea has been further strengthened and developed. Our two countries have further expanded economic mutual assistance and cooperation, and cultural exchanges and other forms of exchanges have become increasingly frequent. Our friendship and cooperation are based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism on national equality and proletarian internationalism. Our two countries are also united in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, our friendship is eternal and unbreakable.
    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, like other socialist countries, loves peace. The Korean people's defeat of American armed aggression is a great contribution to world peace. Now, the Korean people are still standing on the eastern front against imperialism, defending peace in the Far East. The Chinese and Korean people not only have common peaceful aspirations, but also have closely related interests. Therefore, in the struggle for peace, especially in the struggle for peace in the Far East, the Chinese people fully support the Korean people and conduct close cooperation with the Korean people.
    Since the Korean armistice, the Korean-Chinese side has always strictly abided by the armistice agreement, striving to turn the armistice state into a stable peace. In order to promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly put forward fair and reasonable proposals, the first of which is the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea. These proposals have been supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving countries and peoples. However, the United States has not only rejected these proposals, but also constantly undermined the armistice agreement. The United States' intention is obviously to continue to threaten the security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and peace in the Far East, and to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea for a long time, making South Korea a colony of the United States.
    This perverse practice of the United States fundamentally violates the will of the Korean people. Due to the long-term division of the country, Korea's national economy and national culture cannot be developed in a unified way, and the people on both sides of the North and South are artificially isolated and cannot reunite with their relatives and friends. Moreover, the people of South Korea are in a dire situation under the colonial rule of the United States. Therefore, all the Korean people strongly demand that steps be taken to realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland. This legitimate national aspiration of the Korean people has won the sympathy and support of peace-loving countries and peoples all over the world.
    The current international situation is also conducive to striving for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Because the strength of socialism outweighs the strength of imperialism, and the strength of peace outweighs the strength of war, the world situation has reached a new turning point where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. The series of peace initiatives recently put forward by the Soviet Union are further promoting the tide of world peace to develop with overwhelming momentum. Under such circumstances, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on February 5, proposing various proposals for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea. These proposals not only reflect the national aspirations of all the Korean people, but also open up new and realistic ways to ease the tense situation in the Far East. This is another major contribution by the Korean government and the Korean people to the cause of world peace.
    The Chinese government has issued a statement on February 7, expressing its full support for the Korean government's proposals. The Chinese government has always believed that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is the key for the Korean people to realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland through consultation. Therefore, the Chinese government has stated that it is prepared to consult with the Korean government on the issue of the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. At the same time, we resolutely demand that the United States and other relevant countries participating in the United Nations forces also respond to the proposals of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, withdraw their troops from South Korea, and create favorable conditions for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the easing of the situation in the Far East.
    Comrades and friends, in order to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the Korean people still face many arduous tasks. But we firmly believe that the Korean people, closely united around the Workers' Party of Korea and the Republic's government, with the support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people, will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory through continuous efforts. Korea, with its three thousand miles of beautiful mountains and rivers, will surely be completely unified. The Korean people, with their four thousand years of history, will eventually be reunited.
    The Korean people will always receive the full support of the Chinese government and the Chinese people in the cause of building socialism and peacefully reunifying their motherland.
    Victory will surely belong to the hardworking and brave Korean people!
    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
    Long live the Workers' Party of Korea!
    Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the people of China and Korea!
    Long live the consolidated unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!

    朝鲜三千里锦绣山河一定会完全统一
    周恩来总理在平壤市欢迎中国政府代表团群众大会上的讲话亲爱的内阁首相金日成同志，亲爱的平壤市人民委员会委员长金永镇同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    今天能够有机会同朝鲜的民主首都平壤市各界人民的代表们会面，使我们感到十分高兴。感谢你们这样友好、热烈和盛大的欢迎。我受中国人民的委托向你们和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的全体人民表示热烈的问候和崇高的敬意。
    平壤具有悠久的历史和优秀的文化传统，在它一千五百三十多年的历史中，又充满了许多可歌可颂的英雄事迹。在反抗美国侵略的卫国战争中，平壤市的人民在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相的领导下，作出了光辉的贡献，充分地体现出民主朝鲜全体人民的英雄气概。惨无人道的美国侵略者把平壤变成了一片焦土，夺走了无数人的宝贵生命。但是，平壤并没有屈服，平壤市的人民坚守岗位，同朝鲜人民一起奋勇战斗，终于在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中取得了伟大的胜利。今天，平壤已经变得更加美丽，更加雄伟。这是平壤市人民和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民的光荣。英雄的城市平壤象征着朝鲜人民的胜利，象征着朝鲜人民不屈不挠的战斗意志，象征着朝鲜人民不可战胜的力量！
    三年的战争给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国带来了严重的破坏，造成了空前巨大的损失。但是，朝鲜人民并没有在困难的面前低头。在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相的领导下，你们以同样的英雄气概和忘我的劳动热情，克服了种种困难，从事着巨大的恢复和建设工作。在短短的四年多时间里，你们不仅胜利地完成了战后三年经济计划，而且还超额完成了第一个五年计划的第一年人民经济计划。严重的战争创伤已经基本上医治好了，国民经济的各个主要部门已经大大超过了战前1949年的水平，文化教育事业得到了相应地发展，人民的生活水平也有了不断的提高。你们这种艰苦卓绝的劳动赢得了世界上一切进步力量的同情和钦佩，并且得到了以苏联为首的各社会主义国家的热烈支援。你们的巨大成就有力地证明了在你们祖国北半部所建立的社会主义制度具有无比的优越性。
    中国人民庆贺和欢呼朝鲜人民的每一项成就。中国人民能够有像朝鲜人民这样勤劳勇敢的兄弟和战友，深深地感到自豪。朝鲜人民在反侵略斗争中和和平建设中表现出来的坚强意志和苦干精神，都是中国人民经常学习的榜样。中国政府代表团这次来到朝鲜，将要通过实际的参观访问，进一步学习朝鲜人民这种高贵的品质。
    中朝两国人民有着深厚的传统的友谊。我们的友谊是在长期的反对共同敌人的斗争中巩固和发展起来的，因此，这种友谊被我们两国人民誉为鲜血凝成的友谊。过去，在中国人民历次国内革命战争期间和抗日战争期间，朝鲜人民的优秀儿女都曾经不惜牺牲生命支援中国人民。朝鲜人民在反对美国侵略的卫国战争中，一方面捍卫了自己国家的独立，同时也保障了中国的安全，对中国人民的和平建设事业给予了重大的支援。中国人民志愿军在同朝鲜人民一起反抗美国侵略的时期和在战后协助朝鲜人民维护停战和重建家园的时期，都受到朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府的热烈支援和无微不至的关怀。朝鲜人民不仅节衣缩食来支援中国人民志愿军，而且甚至像朝鲜国际主义的战士朴在根那样不惜牺牲自己的生命来救护中国人民志愿军。这些动人的事迹充分地体现了中朝两国人民亲如手足的关系，充分地体现了朝鲜人民高贵的国际主义精神。所有这些，都是中国人民永远不能忘怀和感谢不尽的。
    近几年来，中朝两国人民的友好团结得到了进一步的加强和发展。我们两国在经济上的互助合作已经更加扩大，文化交流和其它方式的往来也日益频繁。我们的友谊和合作是以马克思列宁主义关于民族平等和无产阶级国际主义的原则为基础的。我们两国又都团结在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营里。因此，我们的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，像其他的社会主义国家一样，是热爱和平的。朝鲜人民击败美国的武装侵略，是对世界和平的一个巨大的贡献。现在，朝鲜人民还站在反帝国主义的东方最前线，捍卫着远东的和平。中国人民和朝鲜人民不仅有共同的和平愿望，而且有休戚相关的利益。因此，在争取和平的斗争中，特别是在争取远东和平的斗争中，中国人民全力支持朝鲜人民，并且同朝鲜人民进行密切的合作。
    自从朝鲜停战以来，朝中方面始终严格遵守停战协定，努力使停战状态变为稳定的和平。为了促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾经一再提出公平合理的建议，其中首先是从南北朝鲜撤出一切外国军队。这些建议得到了苏联、中国和其他爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。但是，美国却不仅拒绝这些建议，而且不断破坏停战协定。美国的企图显然是继续威胁朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的安全和远东和平，并且长期阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，使南朝鲜成为美国的殖民地。
    美国这种倒行逆施的做法是根本违背朝鲜人民的意志的。由于国土长期处于分裂的状态，朝鲜的民族经济和民族文化不能得到统一的发展，南北双方的人民被人为地隔绝，不能同自己的亲友团聚。而南朝鲜人民在美国的殖民统治之下更处于水深火热的境地。因此，全体朝鲜人民都强烈要求采取步骤实现祖国的和平统一。朝鲜人民的这种正当的民族愿望，得到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持。
    目前的国际形势也有利于争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。由于社会主义的力量胜过了帝国主义的力量，和平的力量胜过了战争的力量，世界形势已经达到了东风压倒西风的新的转折点。苏联最近所提出的一系列和平倡议，更推动着世界和平的浪潮以排山倒海之势在发展。在这种情况下，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在2月5日发表声明，提出从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队、实现朝鲜的和平统一的各项建议。这些建议不但反映了全朝鲜人民的民族愿望，而且也为和缓远东紧张局势开辟了新的现实的途径。这是朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民对于世界和平事业的又一重大贡献。
    中国政府已经在2月7日发表了声明，表示完全支持朝鲜政府的建议。中国政府一向认为从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，是朝鲜人民自己通过协商实现祖国和平统一的关键。因此，中国政府已经表示，准备就中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的问题同朝鲜政府进行磋商。同时，我们坚决要求美国和参加联合国军的其他有关国家，同样响应朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的建议，把自己的军队从南朝鲜撤出，为朝鲜问题的和平解决和远东局势的和缓创造有利的条件。
    同志们和朋友们，为了实现祖国的和平统一，朝鲜人民还面临着许多艰巨的任务。但是我们深信，紧密地团结在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府周围的朝鲜人民，在以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的人民的支持下，通过不断的努力，一定能够克服一切困难，取得最后的胜利。有着三千里锦绣山河的朝鲜一定会得到完全统一。有着四千年悠久历史的朝鲜人民，终久会团聚在一起。
    朝鲜人民在建设社会主义和和平统一祖国的事业中，将永远得到中国政府和中国人民的全力支持。
    胜利必然属于勤劳勇敢的朝鲜人民！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    朝鲜劳动党万岁！
    中朝两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营巩固的团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
