Editor's Note: The news that Lixian County in Hebei Province and Chongqing city area in Sichuan Province have eliminated the four pests, along with yesterday's report in this newspaper that 80% of villages and streets in Jieshou County, Anhui Province, have achieved "four-nil," is inspiring. Lixian and Jieshou are two ordinary counties among the more than two thousand counties in the country and did not have any superior conditions compared to other places in the fight against the four pests. Chongqing was known for its high rat population before liberation, and it was not uncommon for rats to bite children to death. However, these places have basically eliminated the four pests through tenacious and arduous struggles. This once again powerfully demonstrates that the doubts and concerns of some people about whether the four pests can be completely eliminated, whether unhygienic habits can be changed, and whether various difficulties can be overcome are unfounded. In the face of the facts in Lixian and other places, "skepticism" has completely gone bankrupt.

In the movement to eliminate the four pests, these areas fully mobilized the masses to carry out comprehensive and continuous blitzes. This method of struggle, which never dawdles but concentrates forces to carry out a comprehensive encirclement and suppression, has achieved twice the result with half the effort. This is an important experience. Of course, short-term rounds of blitzes must be combined with regular prevention and control work to consolidate the achievements of the health movement.

Xinhua News Agency report: According to Xinhua News Agency and Hebei Daily news: The people of Lixian County, Hebei Province, after more than two years of hard work, had basically eliminated rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes throughout the county by the Spring Festival, becoming a "four-nil county."

With the arrival of the New Year, Lixian County has taken on a new look of hygiene and cleanliness. In the towns, everything is clean and tidy. Toilets, walls, and the lower half of trees are whitewashed with lime. Even on windy days, there is no dust flying in the streets. Villages such as Beidaliu, Nandaliu, Zhengcun, Xinxing, and Xibeisi have already achieved "everything new, everything white, every household tidy and clean, everyone clean." People can no longer find a sparrow, a pile of garbage, or a rat hole in these villages. A martyr's family member in the west street of Chengguan said proudly: "In the past, imperialists said that we were unhygienic and 'sick men of East Asia.' Now let them come and see, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have eliminated the four pests and everything is clean. What they could not do, we have done!"

In the winter of 1955, Lixian County, following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee and the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), made a resolution on launching a movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene by the whole party and the whole people. In the past two years, the county has launched three major blitzes to eliminate the four pests and nearly a hundred large and small battles. Last winter, the county-wide "bi-monthly blitz" mobilized 150,000 people to encircle and annihilate the remaining rats and isolated sparrows; at the same time, they also dug pits for mud, repaired pig pens, cleaned toilets, chicken coops, millstones, and livestock sheds, fumigated and cleaned more than 23,000 vegetable cellars, yam cellars, and darkrooms, eliminated overwintering adult mosquitoes, and destroyed breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. In the days before the basic elimination of the four pests, the county also formed hundreds of assault teams to eliminate 24 backward villages and more than 3,000 unsanitary corners.

In order to consolidate the achievements already made, the people of Lixian County have established hygiene covenants in each village and household. The County Party Committee conducts inspections and comparisons every half month, requiring each township to have standard hygiene villages and each village to have standard hygiene households, setting examples and promoting overall progress. This spring, the county will also combine the production upsurge with the mop-up work to eliminate the four pests. In order to eliminate sparrows entering the country, joint defense teams will be established in all border villages throughout the county to eliminate one sparrow at a time.

Xinhua News Agency special article by Xinhua News Agency reporter Gong Chenghua: The people of Chongqing city area, after seven days and seven nights of hard work before the Spring Festival, have basically eliminated rats, flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows. In seven days, a total of 1,080,000 rats were eliminated, only 150,000 fewer than the total number of rats eliminated in the district from 1952 to the end of last year.

Chongqing was a city with a high rat population before liberation. Buildings in the urban area that easily harbored rats accounted for more than 67% of all buildings; the underground channels, which were 144 kilometers long, had steep slopes and many bends, making it easy for rats to breed. Before liberation, rats dared to snatch food from people's hands, and it was not uncommon for people to have their ears and noses bitten while sleeping, and even for children to be bitten to death. After dusk, rats ran rampant openly in the streets and crowds. Passing travelers said that Chongqing rats were "well-deserved," and many people were "terrified at the mention of rats." In the years since liberation, due to the vigorous development of the patriotic health movement, more than 1.27 million rats have been caught and killed over the years, but there are still many rats.

In order to eliminate rats in the shortest possible time, the people of Chongqing city area adopted the strategy and tactics of a comprehensive mobilization of general attack, encirclement, and suppression, and massively used poisoned bait to kill rats, combined with the use of tools to catch and beat them, and used sulfur smoke to fumigate underground sewers, creating a dragnet for rats, leaving them nowhere to escape. When using various instruments, especially poisoned bait, to poison rats, they paid great attention to ensuring the safety of people and livestock. From February 11 to 13, was the stage of completely cutting off the rat's food supply, and from the 14th to the 16th was the stage of releasing poisoned bait. During these tense days of hard work, more than 20,000 shock team members and activists went door-to-door every night to place poisoned bait for rats, and then went door-to-door to collect dead rats and uneaten poisoned bait the next day, some without sleep for several nights in a row. In addition, cadres and troops from city agencies, organizations, and troops were mobilized to turn over more than 200 warehouses, grain stores, and food processing factories that could not be poisoned, eliminating a large number of rats. In the entire 144-kilometer-long sewer system in the urban area, sulfur was used on a large scale to fumigate and kill the rats, finally wiping out the ditch rats in one fell swoop. In the work of smoking out ditch rats, the enthusiasm of the masses was unprecedented, and every household sealed all the inlet holes on time.

The Chongqing City Area Four Pests Elimination Command recently conducted inspections on fifteen sewers, picked up many dead rats, and did not find a single live rat, proving that the ditch rats have been basically eliminated. Recently, responsible persons from the Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau and other units went to Guanjing Lane and other places where there were more rats in the past, and the residents unanimously reported that they could no longer hear the sound of rats.

While concentrating on exterminating rats, the people of Chongqing city area took various measures to launch a blitz to exterminate flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows.

    两年奋战蠡县实现四无  七天突击重庆除掉四害
    编者按：河北省蠡县和四川省重庆市城区消灭四害，和昨日本报刊载的安徽省界首县80％的村庄街道实现“四无”的消息，是令人振奋的喜讯。蠡县和界首，是全国两千多个县中的普普通通的两个县，在除四害斗争中，比别的地方并没有什么优越的条件。重庆在解放前还以多鼠出名，那时老鼠咬死小孩，并不算是奇闻。但是，这几个地方经过顽强艰苦的斗争，已基本上除尽了四害。这就再一次有力地说明了有些人对四害能否除尽、不卫生的习惯能否改变、各种困难能否克服的怀疑和顾虑，是没有根据的。在蠡县等地的事实面前，“怀疑论”全部破产了。
    这几个地区在除四害运动中，充分地发动群众进行了全面的连续的突击。这种决不慢慢腾腾，而集中力量进行全面围剿的斗争方法，收到了事半功倍的效果。这是一条重要的经验。当然，短期的几个回合的突击，还必须与经常的防治工作相结合，才能使卫生运动的成绩更为巩固。
    本报讯　据新华社和河北日报消息：河北省蠡县人民奋战两年多，到春节期间，已在全县范围内基本消灭老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇和蚊子，成为“四无县”。
    随着新春的到来，蠡县出现了卫生而整洁的新景象。在城镇里，到处干净整齐。厕所、墙壁和树木的下半截都用石灰水刷白了。遇到刮风天，街上也没有尘土飞扬。在北大留、南大留、郑村、辛兴、西北寺等村庄已经作到了“处处新，片片白，户户整齐干净，人人干干净净”。人们在这些村庄再也找不到一只麻雀、一堆垃圾或一个鼠洞。城关西街有位烈属自豪地说：“过去帝国主义者说我们不讲卫生，是‘东亚病夫’，现在叫他们再来看看吧，在共产党领导下，我们消灭了四害，到处干干净净。他们办不到的事，我们办到了！”
    蠡县在1955年冬天，就遵循党中央和省委的指示以及全国农业发展纲要（草案）的精神，作出了关于发动全党全民开展除四害、讲卫生运动的决议。两年多以来，全县共发动三次除四害的大突击和近百次大小战役。去年冬，全县范围的“双月突击”运动，动员了十五万人，围歼漏网的残鼠、孤雀；同时，还进行挖坑泥，修猪圈，清理厕所、鸡窝、碾磨道和牲口棚，熏杀和清除了两万三千多处菜窖、山药窖和暗室，消灭了越冬成蚊，捣毁了蚊蝇的孳生地。在基本消灭四害的前几天，这个县还组成了几百个突击组，消灭二十四个落后村庄和三千多处不卫生的角落。
    蠡县人民为了巩固已经取得的成果，各村、各户都订立了卫生公约。中共县委每半月进行一次检查评比，要求乡乡有标准卫生村，村村有标准卫生户，树立榜样，推动全面。今春还要结合生产高潮进行除四害的扫尾工作。为了消灭侵入境内的麻雀，在全县各个边沿村庄还要建立联防队，作到来一个消灭一个。
    本报特约新华社专稿　新华社记者龚成华报道：重庆市城区人民在春节前夕，苦战七天七夜，基本消灭了老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子、麻雀。七天内，共消灭老鼠一百零八万只，比这个区从1952年到去年年底六年全部消灭的老鼠只少十五万只。
    重庆在解放前是一个多鼠的城市。城区易于藏鼠的房屋建筑占全部建筑物的67％以上；全长一百四十四公里的地下沟道坡大弯多，极易繁殖老鼠。解放以前，老鼠胆敢在人手里抢夺食物，熟睡以后被老鼠咬破耳朵、鼻子的也大有人在，甚至咬死小孩，而到黄昏以后，老鼠猖獗到公然在大街上人丛中乱跑。过往旅客都说重庆耗子“名不虚传”，大有“谈鼠色变”之感。解放几年以来，由于大力开展爱国卫生运动，历年捕灭老鼠一百二十七万多只，但是老鼠仍然不少。
    为了在最短时间内消灭老鼠，重庆城区人民采取了全面发动总攻、围歼、包剿的战略战术，大规模地施放毒饵杀鼠，配合使用工具捕打，硫磺烟熏地下水道，向老鼠布下一个天罗地网，使其无处逃生。他们在使用各种器械、特别是使用毒饵来毒杀老鼠时，十分注意确保人畜的安全。从2月11日起至13日止是彻底断鼠粮阶段，14日到16日是施放毒饵阶段。在这紧张的苦战日子里，突击队员和积极分子二万多人，每天深夜挨门逐户去安放毒鼠的毒饵，在第二天又挨户去收回死鼠和未被鼠吃的毒饵，有的一连几夜不眠。另外，动员了全市机关、团体的干部和部队，对不能施放毒饵的二百多个仓库、粮店、食品加工厂进行翻仓，消灭了大量老鼠。在城区全长一百四十四公里的下水道系统全线，大规模的用硫磺进行熏杀，终于把沟鼠一网打尽。在烟熏沟鼠工作中，群众的积极性空前高涨，家家户户都按时密封了一切进水洞口。
    重庆市城区除四害战斗指挥部最近在十五条下水道进行检查，拣到许多死鼠，没有发现一只活鼠，证明沟道老鼠已经基本消灭。重庆市卫生局等单位的负责人最近又深入到过去老鼠较多的官井巷等处访问，居民们一致反映现在再也听不到老鼠的响动了。
    重庆城区人民与聚歼老鼠的同时，采取了各项措施，突击歼灭了苍蝇、蚊子和麻雀。
