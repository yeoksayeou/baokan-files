Striving for the peaceful reunification of Korea is the national aspiration of the Korean people and the solemn task stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement stipulates that both sides should "within three months after the signing and entry into force of the Armistice Agreement, appoint representatives to convene a high-level political conference of both sides to negotiate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue." However, due to obstruction and sabotage by the United States, this provision was not implemented.

The bilateral talks held on October 26, 1953, in Panmunjom to prepare for the political conference were unreasonably interrupted by the U.S. representative and failed to reach any agreement.

From April to June 1954, a foreign ministers' conference was held in Geneva to discuss the Korean issue. At the conference, the Korean and Chinese sides put forward a fair, reasonable, and practical plan, suggesting that all foreign troops be withdrawn from all areas of Korea within a certain period, and then free elections be held throughout Korea under the supervision of a neutral nations supervisory commission. This plan was supported by the Soviet delegation and fair world public opinion. However, these reasonable suggestions were unreasonably rejected by the United States and its followers. They continued to demand that the United Nations, one of the belligerent parties, control the elections, attempting to impose the U.S. aggressors and Syngman Rhee's reactionary rule on the entire Korean people. Moreover, they proposed the absurd idea that the Chinese People's Volunteers should withdraw from North Korea while the U.S. troops should continue to occupy South Korea.

The Soviet Union made unremitting efforts in the United Nations to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Soviet representative had once again advocated holding a conference of relevant countries to discuss the Korean issue in the Political Committee of the Ninth UN General Assembly. However, the United States manipulated the United Nations to illegally pass the so-called "Fifteen-Nation Proposal," demanding that the United Nations approve its "basic principle" of UN supervision of Korean elections, which it unilaterally insisted on at the Geneva Conference.

Since then, the Korean and Chinese sides have continued to advocate convening a conference of relevant countries to discuss the issue of Korean reunification. On October 27, 1955, Premier Kim Il-sung told Indian journalists that all foreign troops should be withdrawn, the armed forces of North and South Korea should be reduced to a minimum, and a Far East conference with broad participation of Asian countries should be convened by relevant countries as soon as possible to discuss the peaceful reunification of Korea. On April 9, 1956, the Chinese government, in its own name and entrusted by the government of Democratic People's Republic of Korea, suggested to the British government, and through the British government to the governments of other countries on the United Nations side, to convene a conference of relevant countries to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, on May 28, the British government, representing the governments of various countries on the United Nations side, rejected this constructive suggestion.

Last June, the U.S. side further unilaterally announced the abandonment of the clause in the Armistice Agreement regarding the prohibition of the introduction of reinforcing weapons, seriously undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement. At that time, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea lodged a strong protest against this and suggested that in order to promote the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, ensure the consolidation of peace, and promote the peaceful reunification of Korea, an international conference with broad participation of relevant countries should be convened quickly. The Chinese and Soviet governments issued statements respectively, giving full support. However, this suggestion still did not receive the approval of the United States.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has also continuously taken the initiative to seek direct contact with the South Korean authorities for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. In October 1954, the Eighth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Republic passed an appeal to the South Korean National Assembly, various political parties, social organizations, people from all walks of life, and the South Korean people, requesting the convening of an international conference to re-discuss the Korean issue, and calling for a consultative conference to discuss the peaceful reunification of the motherland to be held in Pyongyang or Seoul in 1955. At the same time, proceeding from the interests of the Korean people, the government of the Republic suggested that the Korean people be specially allowed to travel freely between North and South Korea for non-military purposes and that North and South Korea establish commercial, postal, and telecommunications links, in order to solve the economic difficulties of South Korea, guarantee South Korean fishermen fishing in the territorial waters of the Republic, and supply South Korea with electricity, rice, and other materials. However, all these efforts to seek the peaceful reunification of the motherland have been unreasonably rejected by the South Korean authorities.

Now, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is once again demanding the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the implementation of free elections throughout Korea in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of North and South Korea; the Chinese People's Volunteers have decided to voluntarily withdraw from Korea in batches, which is a very timely and important peaceful step.

    争取朝鲜的和平统一
    实现朝鲜的和平统一，是朝鲜人民的民族愿望，也是朝鲜停战协定所规定的庄严任务。
    停战协定第六十款规定：双方应在“停战协定签字并生效后的三个月内，分派代表召开双方高一级的政治会议，协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题”。但由于美国的阻挠和破坏，这一规定未能执行。
    1953年10月26日在板门店举行的为政治会议作准备工作的双方会谈，被美方代表无理中断，未能达成任何协议。
    1954年4月到6月在日内瓦举行了外长会议，讨论了朝鲜问题。在会议上，朝中方面提出了公正合理而又切实可行的方案，建议在一定的期限内，一切外国军队从朝鲜全部地区撤退，然后在中立国国际机构监督下举行全朝鲜自由选举。这个方案得到苏联代表团以及世界公正舆论的支持。但这些合理的建议，遭到了美国和它的追随者的无理拒绝。它们继续要求由作战一方的联合国来控制选举，企图把美国侵略者和李承晚的反动统治强加在全朝鲜人民头上。不仅如此，它们还提出要中国人民志愿军从北朝鲜撤退而美国军队却继续占领南朝鲜的荒谬主张。
    苏联在联合国为促成朝鲜的和平统一作了不懈的努力。苏联代表就曾在第九届联大政治委员会上再次主张举行有关国家会议讨论朝鲜问题。但美国却操纵联合国非法通过了所谓“十五国提案”，要联合国批准它在日内瓦会议上片面坚持的由联合国监督朝鲜选举的“基本原则”。
    自此以后，朝中方面继续主张召开有关国家会议来讨论朝鲜的统一问题。1955年10月27日金日成首相对印度记者表示，应撤退一切外国军队，把南北朝鲜的武装力量缩减到最小限度，并由有关国家早日召开亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议讨论朝鲜和平统一问题。1956年4月9日我国政府以自己的名义，并接受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，向英国政府、并且通过英国政府向联合国军方面其他各国政府建议召开一次有关国家的会议，协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜等问题。但是5月28日英国政府代表联合国军方面的各国政府拒绝了这一建设性的建议。
    去年6月，美方进一步片面宣布废弃停战协定中关于不得运入增援性武器的条款，严重地破坏了朝鲜停战协定，当时朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为此提出强硬抗议，并且建议为促使外国军队撤离朝鲜、保证巩固和平和促进朝鲜的和平统一，应迅速召开有关国家广泛参加的国际会议。我国和苏联政府分别发表声明，给予完全的支持。但是，这个建议仍然没有得到美国的赞同。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为祖国的和平统一，还不断地主动采取措施，谋求和南朝鲜当局建立直接接触。1954年10月共和国最高人民议会第八届会议曾通过致南朝鲜国会、各政党、社会团体、各界人士以及南朝鲜人民的号召书，要求召开重新讨论朝鲜问题的国际会议，并号召1955年内在平壤或汉城召开讨论祖国和平统一的协商会议。同时，共和国政府从朝鲜人民的利益出发，曾建议特许朝鲜人民为非军事性目的自由来往于南北朝鲜之间和南北朝鲜建立通商和邮电联系，为解决南朝鲜的经济困难，保证南朝鲜渔民在共和国领海捕鱼，向南朝鲜供给电力、大米和其他物资。但是，所有这些谋求祖国和平统一的努力，都遭到南朝鲜当局的无理拒绝。
    现在，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国再次要求撤退一切外国军队、实行全朝鲜自由选举，以实现南北朝鲜和平统一；中国人民志愿军决定主动分批全部撤出朝鲜，这是十分适时的重要的和平步骤。　（恕）
