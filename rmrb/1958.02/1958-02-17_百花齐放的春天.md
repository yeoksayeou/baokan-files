    The Spring of Blooming Flowers
    Lao She

    I have a strong connection with the character “Spring.” My formal name is “Qingchun” (Celebrating Spring).

    I can’t quite remember whether it was the day before or after my birthday, but it coincided with the Beginning of Spring festival. There's no need to check the old almanac; anyway, that’s the main reason I'm called "Spring."

    The Beginning of Spring is the first solar term of the year. One can imagine that my parents must have thought: a son named Spring must have a great future and will surely bring glory to the ancestors.

    One can also imagine that the character Spring has always been auspicious, and my parents certainly hoped that their children would be as beautiful as spring flowers, have a lucky life, and everything would go smoothly.

    Unfortunately, carrying this auspicious name for decades, I never really lived up to it. From childhood to adulthood, until before Liberation, I hardly ever saw a real spring. Ever since I learned to write, under the supervision of my elders, every Spring Festival, I had to find some red paper and write "Raise Your Head and See Joy" and "Go Out and See Joy," and paste them inside and outside the courtyard respectively. However, joy never came; life was like Wang Xiao'er celebrating the New Year, getting worse every year.

    This shows that using writing as a talisman to seek wealth and pray for blessings does not necessarily bring success. Today's facts prove that what is truly effective is revolutionary drive, not "Raise Your Head and See Joy" or "Go Out and See Joy." If you only raise your head and don't work, if you only go out and don't do anything, where does joy come from? Similarly, only relying on an auspicious name, something something Spring, without doing what one should do in Spring, always hoping for a good life, is just wishful thinking.

    This year, not only has Spring truly arrived, but it has arrived so early! Before the Beginning of Spring, good news has been constantly pouring in from all over the country: workers are increasing production, farmers are vigorously developing water conservancy, and men, women, old, and young are all working together to eliminate the four pests. It is truly a scene of spring across the land, with everyone striving bravely, unprecedented! This is the real spring, even though the weather is still very cold. Seasons are dead, but people are alive; revolutionary drive can turn winter into spring. With a warm heart and sweating, one can achieve spring in all seasons. "Spring across the land" is no longer empty talk. "Eternal Spring" has also become a reality—from this year on, the Chinese nation will surely live in spring forever. If there is no spring, we will create it!

    Speaking of my own profession, many writers have already gone to the countryside, up the mountains, or to factories and the army. This really fulfills the saying: "Go Out and See Joy." Isn’t it a great joy to go out the door and see workers, peasants, and soldiers? I absolutely believe that in a couple of years, everyone will definitely be able to write some decent works that reflect the bright and beautiful spring of the nation.

    Of course, we will encounter many difficulties. But what does that matter? What workers, peasants, and soldiers can do, we can also do, as long as we are willing to sincerely learn from them. Although our work and theirs are different in nature, both require revolutionary drive. With this drive, we will also have a great leap forward in literary and artistic work. Our spring should be a spring of blooming flowers. No matter what difficulties there are, we must have a hundred flowers blooming and spring filling the universe!

### 百花齐放的春天

    百花齐放的春天
    老舍
    “春”字跟我很有缘。我的学名是“庆春”。
    已记不清楚：是我的生日的前一天呢，还是后一天，正赶上立春佳节。无须去查老皇历吧，反正这是我叫作“春”的主要原因。
    立春是一年中的头一个节气。可以想像到，当初我的父母必是这么看：有子名春，来头必大，定会增光耀祖。
    还可以想像到：春字向来是个吉祥字，父母当然希望儿女美似春花，一生吉利，万事亨通。
    可惜，我带着这个吉祥字，过了好几十年，并未名副其实。自幼至长，直到解放前，我差不多没见过什么真正的春天。自从一会写字，我即在长辈的督促下，每到春节，必找点红纸，写上“抬头见喜”与“出门见喜”，分别贴在屋内与院外。可是，喜总不来，生活正如王小二过年，一年不如一年。
    足见拿文字当作符咒，求财祈福，并不能有求必应。用今天的事实证明，真正灵验的是革命干劲儿，不是“抬头见喜”或“出门见喜”。光抬头，不动手，光出门，不干活儿，喜从何来呢？同样的，只凭名字吉祥，什么什么春，而不干春天该干的事情，虽切盼过好日子，总是妄想。
    今年，春天不但真来了，而且来得那么早！立春以前，全国到处已不断传来喜信：工人增产，农民大兴水利，男女老幼一律动手除灭四害，真是大地皆春，人人奋勇，史无前例！这是真正的春天，虽然天气还很冷。季节是死的，人可是活的，革命劲头儿会叫冬天变作春天。心里热呼呼的，身上出着热汗，就能作到四季皆春。“大地皆春”已不再是空话。“万古长春”也落了实——从今年起，中华民族必永远生活在春天里。没有春天，咱们会去创造！
    说到我的本行，许多作家已经下乡上山，或到工厂与部队去了。这真应了那句话：“出门见喜”。出了屋门，见到工农兵，还不是大喜事么？我绝对相信，过个三年两载，大家一定能够写出些像样子的作品，反映民族春天的花明柳媚。
    不错，我们会遇到不少困难。可是，那怕什么呢？工农兵能作到的，我们就也能作到，只要我们肯真心地向他们学习。我们的和他们的工作性质虽然不同，可是都需要革命的干劲儿。有了这股干劲儿，我们也会在文艺工作上来个大跃进。我们的春天应该是百花齐放的春天，不管有什么困难，也要百花齐放，春满乾坤！
