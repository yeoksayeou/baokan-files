From various newspapers:

    Not Walking on Flat Ground, Not Showing High Mountains
    A fresh piece of news was reported on the first page of the Xi'an Daily on the 10th: Recently, the Party organizations of more than a dozen large factories in Xi'an have organized thousands of workers to visit some small factories and handicraft cooperatives. Through the visits, the workers saw that although the production equipment, working environment, and welfare conditions of these small factories and cooperatives were much worse than those of the large factories, the workers and members were very enthusiastic about their work and could excellently complete their production tasks, which was very educational. Before the visits, some workers in the large factories had excessively high demands for wages and benefits. After the visits, many workers said they were "unaware of their blessings while living in them," and that one does not appreciate high mountains without traversing flat ground.

    不走平地、不显高山
    10日西安日报一版报道了一件新鲜事：最近一个时期，西安有十多个大型工厂的党组织，组织了数千名工人到一些小工厂、手工业合作社去参观。通过参观，工人们看到这些小厂、合作社的生产设备、工作环境和生活福利条件比之大厂虽然很差，但工人、社员的工作热情却很高，并能出色地完成生产任务，受到很大教育。参观前大厂部分工人对工资、福利有过高的要求，参观后，很多工人都说自己“身在福中不知福”，不走平地不显高山。
