Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong, the secretaries of both sides of the Korean Military Armistice Commission met today at the request of the US side. The secretary of the Korean and Chinese side sternly rejected the unreasonable demand made by the US side to return a civil aviation aircraft of the Syngman Rhee group "together with the pilots, passengers and cargo" to them.

This aircraft defected to northern Korea on the afternoon of the 16th.

The secretary of the Korean and Chinese side clearly pointed out at the meeting that those who defected to northern Korea took this step to oppose the US aggressor troops' occupation of South Korea, and they could not tolerate the increasingly intensified fascist oppression and tyranny of the US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee group.

The secretary of the Korean and Chinese side also said: If there is anything to be said about the above-mentioned aircraft and crew, then the South Korean authorities should speak directly with the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    美方无理要求我交回南朝鲜起义飞机
    朝中方面予以严正拒绝
    新华社平壤18日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议今天在美方的要求下开了会。朝中方面秘书长在会议上严正拒绝了美方提出的要把李承晚集团的一架民用航空飞机“连同飞行员、旅客和货物”送还给他们的无理要求。
    这架飞机是在16日下午起义飞抵朝鲜北部的。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上明确指出，那些起义到朝鲜北部来的人们采取这个步骤来反对美国侵略军队侵占南朝鲜，他们不能忍受日益变本加厉的美帝国主义和李承晚集团的法西斯压迫和暴政。
    朝中方面秘书长还说：如果对上述的飞机和机上人员的问题有什么话要说，那就应当由南朝鲜当局直接同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府说。
