Xinhua News Agency, 26th — The All-China Women's Federation recently issued a circular regarding the conference of directors of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region women's federations held in January this year, requiring women's federation organizations at all levels to correct their understanding and comprehensively and correctly implement the policy of diligent and thrifty national construction and diligent and thrifty housekeeping while completing various tasks for 1958.

The circular, after affirming and summarizing the achievements and experiences in publicizing and implementing the policy of diligent and thrifty national construction and diligent and thrifty housekeeping since the Third National Women's Congress, pointed out that in 1958, the All-China Women's Federation and women's federation organizations at all levels must focus on the high tide of industrial and agricultural production and the socialist education movement, and on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement, muster revolutionary vigor, strive for leap-forward development in women's work, so as to better implement the resolution of the Third National Women's Congress on "Diligent and thrifty national construction, diligent and thrifty housekeeping, and striving for socialist construction," and more fully utilize women's socialist enthusiasm and creativity, in order to contribute the greatest strength to building socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. The circular pointed out that the main tasks of the All-China Women's Federation and women's federation organizations at all levels in 1958 are: to continue to mobilize and organize women to participate in the socialist education movement; to mobilize and help women study, improve their skills, work hard in production, practice strict economy, and strive to build socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way; to vigorously promote family planning; to educate women to actively participate in the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests; and for the women's federation organizations themselves to conduct thorough rectification, conscientiously improve their work style, rectify their organization, and raise the consciousness of cadres.

The circular said that implementing the policy of diligent and thrifty national construction and diligent and thrifty housekeeping is the key to carrying out women's work. However, recently, in publicizing and implementing this policy, some places have had some one-sided understandings. The circular pointed out that diligent and thrifty national construction, diligent and thrifty operation of cooperatives, diligent and thrifty operation of all undertakings, and diligent and thrifty housekeeping are all for the active purpose of rapidly developing production and rapidly building socialism. The vast number of women across the country are engaged in industrial and agricultural production and various construction works, and are also housewives who manage household affairs. Even the vast number of housewives should support production and construction from their families. Therefore, for all women, diligent and thrifty national construction, diligent and thrifty operation of cooperatives, and diligent and thrifty housekeeping should be comprehensively implemented, and both diligence and thrift should be given equal importance, whether it is national construction or housekeeping. Diligence can develop production, create wealth, and increase income; thrift can reduce waste and increase accumulation. The combination of the two can build the country well and manage the household well. And hard work is the most fundamental aspect. Only thrift without diligence is like water without a source, unable to increase wealth; only diligence without thrift cannot increase accumulation, expand reproduction, nor further improve life. Therefore, the policy of diligent and thrifty national construction and diligent and thrifty housekeeping proceeds both from the current general task of the people of the whole country and from the characteristics of women. It is the fundamental policy of the women's movement in the period of socialist transition, and it includes the aspect of women actively participating in industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings, as well as the aspect of doing a good job in household labor and various household sideline production; it includes hard work, and it also includes strict economy. It is comprehensive, complete, and indivisible. Therefore, it must never be one-sidedly understood as mobilizing women to engage in production in the past, and now mobilizing women to simply engage in housework.

The circular said that it is completely correct to integrate the spirit of diligence and thrift into the family, but from the perspective of comprehensively leading women's work, if we isolate and only engage in diligent and thrifty housekeeping, or even deviate from diligent and thrifty national construction and the direction of striving for socialist construction, it will not only make the leading ideology easily confined to a narrow scope, neglecting the main aspect of mobilizing and organizing the vast number of women to directly participate in collective production and socialist construction; but also, if it develops, it may obscure the purpose of diligent and thrifty housekeeping among the masses, and even lead to only caring about personal wealth and ignoring collective production and social labor, failing to recognize that the happiness and improved life of individuals and families must be built on the basis of collective prosperity, so it cannot play a role in promoting the development of production.

The circular talked about the issues that must be paid attention to in publicizing and implementing the policy of diligent and thrifty housekeeping. The circular said that implementing diligent and thrifty housekeeping is to integrate the spirit of diligence and thrift into people's daily lives, thereby creating such a situation among the masses: both diligent and thrifty, and living well; both obeying the national supply plan, and being in a happy mood; both having planned expenditures, and having personal freedom in the family. This not only conforms to the interests of the country and can promote the development of national construction, but is also necessary for family interests and can help improve family life and enhance family harmony and happiness. The circular said that advocating such a situation is not to ask the masses to lower their living standards and live a hard life, but to guide the people to reasonable consumption and gradually improve their lives on the basis of developing production. To form such a situation, it must be through the conscious willingness of the masses, and let the masses themselves master it. We must recognize that arranging family life is the matter of the masses themselves, and guiding the masses to correct and reasonable consumption can only be done through in-depth and meticulous ideological guidance, and cannot be done with administrative orders or substituting for them. We must make the masses truly understand that diligent and thrifty housekeeping is a good thing for the country, for the society, and for the family, and be happy to implement it, gradually turn it into a habit, and gradually form a social atmosphere. The circular pointed out that the practice of individual areas indiscriminately making excessive demands on the masses and individual area cadres substituting for the masses to make family plans, conduct inspections, and using this as a standard to measure the quality of work is inappropriate. The circular said that doing so easily leads to interfering in the lives of the masses, making the masses mistakenly believe that diligent and thrifty housekeeping means living a hard life. This all goes against the spirit of the masses consciously and willingly implementing this policy in a happy mood, and therefore cannot truly achieve the purpose of promoting production development, which should be corrected.

However, the circular said, emphasizing the conscious willingness of the masses does not mean that leadership is not needed; opposing putting excessive slogans and unified indicators to the masses does not mean not making demands on the masses; opposing cadres substituting for the masses to make plans and conduct inspections does not mean not guiding the masses to arrange their family lives in a planned way. On the contrary, it is very necessary to put appropriate slogans and demands to the masses and stimulate their enthusiasm so that they have goals to strive for. The circular said that thrift is a long-term policy for our country to build socialism. We must guide the masses to consciously and voluntarily formulate some plans for increasing production and practicing economy (it is not necessary to require every household to make them public). On the basis of organizing the masses to exchange experiences, guide the masses to automatically check the implementation of the plans. For extravagant and wasteful behaviors, such as holding large banquets for weddings and funerals and extravagant waste due to superstition, as well as gambling and other bad habits, we should actively mobilize the masses to criticize and dissuade them to create public opinion in society.

The circular emphasized that although the current objective situation is extremely favorable for women's work, the development of work in various places is uneven. Women's federation cadres must make greater efforts to keep up with the development of the situation, go deeper into the masses, learn to use the working method of the mass line, further open up the situation, and do a good job.

### 不能离开勤俭建国单搞勤俭持家  全国妇联发出通报，要求各级妇联全面正确贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭持家方针

    不能离开勤俭建国单搞勤俭持家
    全国妇联发出通报，要求各级妇联全面正确贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭持家方针
    据新华社26日讯　全国妇联最近发出关于今年1月召开的省、市、自治区妇联主任会议的通报，要求各级妇联组织在完成1958年各项工作时，必须端正认识，全面正确地贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针。
    通报在肯定和总结了自全国第三次妇代大会以来，宣传执行勤俭建国、勤俭持家方针的成绩和经验之后指出，1958年全国妇联和各级妇联组织必须围绕工农业生产高潮和社会主义教育运动，在整风运动胜利的基础上，鼓足革命干劲，争取妇女工作得到跃进的发展，以便更好地贯彻执行第三次全国妇代大会关于
  “勤俭建国、勤俭持家，为建设社会主义而奋斗”的决议，更充分地发挥妇女的社会主义积极性、创造性，以便为又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义而贡献最大的力量。通报指出，全国妇联和各级妇联在1958年的主要工作任务是：继续动员和组织妇女参加社会主义教育运动；动员和帮助妇女学习，提高技术，努力生产，厉行节约，争取多、快、好、省地建设社会主义；大力宣传计划生育；教育妇女积极参加以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动；妇联组织本身深入整风，认真地改进作风，整顿组织，提高干部的觉悟。
    通报说，贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针是开展妇女工作的关键。但是，最近在宣传贯彻这个方针的时候，有的地方有些片面的理解。通报指出，勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业，勤俭持家，都是为了迅速发展生产，迅速建成社会主义这一积极目的。全国广大妇女，既从事工农业生产和各项建设工作，又是操持家务的主妇，即使广大的家庭妇女，也要从家庭中支援生产建设。因此，对全体妇女来讲，勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家应当全面贯彻执行，无论建国或持家，勤和俭都应当并重。勤可以发展生产，创造财富，增加收入；俭可以减少浪费，增加积累。两者相互结合，即可建好国也可持好家。而辛勤劳动又是最根本的方面。只俭不勤，就是无源之水，不能增加财富；只勤不俭，不能增加积累，扩大再生产，也不能进一步改善生活。所以勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针，既根据全国人民当前的总任务出发，又根据妇女的特点出发，它是社会主义过渡时期妇女运动的根本方针，它包括妇女积极参加工农业生产和各项建设事业的一面，又包括搞好家务劳动和各种家庭副业生产的一面；包括辛勤劳动，又包括厉行节约。它是全面的、完整的、不可分割的。因此，绝不能片面理解为过去是动员妇女搞生产，现在是动员妇女单纯搞家务。
    通报说，把勤俭的精神贯串到家庭中去是完全正确的，但是从全面领导妇女工作来说，如果孤立地只搞勤俭持家，甚至脱离勤俭建国，脱离为建设社会主义而奋斗的方向，不仅使领导思想容易局限于狭窄的范围，忽略对动员组织广大妇女直接参加集体生产和社会主义建设的主要方面；而且发展下去，还可能使群众对勤俭持家的目的模糊起来，甚至导致只顾个人兴家致富，忽视集体生产和社会劳动，不认识个人和家庭的幸福及生活改善，必须是建筑在集体富裕的基础上，这样对发展生产也就不能起促进的作用。
    通报谈到在宣传贯彻勤俭持家的方针中必须注意的问题。通报说，贯彻勤俭持家，是要把勤俭的精神贯串到人们的日常生活中去，从而在群众中造成这样一个局面：既要勤劳节俭，又要生活得好；既要服从国家供应计划，又要心情舒畅；既要有计划开支，又要有家庭个人的自由。这既符合国家的利益，能够促进国家建设的发展，又为家庭利益所必需，能有助于家庭生活改善，增进家庭的和睦幸福。通报说，提倡这样一个局面，不是要群众降低生活水平过苦日子，恰恰是引导人民合理的消费和在发展生产的基础上逐步改善生活。要形成这样一个局面，必须通过群众的自觉自愿，由群众自己去掌握。必须认识安排家庭生活是群众自己的事，指导群众正确的、合理的消费，只能通过深入细致的思想诱导，不能用行政命令或代替包办。要使群众真正懂得勤俭持家是利国、利社、利家的好事，乐于执行，逐步变成习惯，逐步形成社会风气。通报指出，个别地区不加分别的向群众提出过分的要求和个别地区的干部代替群众订家庭计划，搞检查，并以此作为衡量工作好坏的标准的作法是不妥当的。通报说，这样做，容易形成干涉群众生活，使群众误认为勤俭持家就是过苦日子。这都与群众自觉自愿地心情舒畅地贯彻执行这个方针的精神相违背，因此不能真正达到促进生产发展的目的，这是应当注意改正的。
    但是，通报说，强调群众自觉自愿，不等于不要领导；反对向群众提过火的口号和统一的指标，不等于不向群众提要求；反对干部代替包办订计划、搞检查，不等于不引导群众有计划地安排家庭生活。相反，向群众提出适宜的口号和要求，激发群众积极性，使之有奋斗目标，这是十分需要的。通报说，节约是我国建设社会主义的一个长远方针，要引导群众自觉自愿地制订一些增产节约计划（不必要求家家公开）。在组织群众交流经验的基础上，引导群众自动检查计划的执行情况。对于铺张浪费的行为，如婚丧喜庆大办酒席和因迷信而大肆浪费以及赌博等恶习，应当积极发动群众批判和劝阻，以造成社会舆论。
    通报强调说，当前虽然客观形势对妇女工作极为有利，但各地工作的发展是不平衡的，妇联干部如何跟上形势的发展，更加深入群众，学会运用群众路线的工作方法，进一步打开局面，做好工作，还须作更大努力。
