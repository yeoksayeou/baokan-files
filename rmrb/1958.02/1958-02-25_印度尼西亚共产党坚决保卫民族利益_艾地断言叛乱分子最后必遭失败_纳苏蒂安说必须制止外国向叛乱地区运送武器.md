Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 24th: The Jakarta "People's Daily" today published a statement by Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, on the current domestic situation. Aidit said that the current problem in Indonesia is a problem of national versus anti-national. The Indonesian Communist Party, along with other parties, stands on the side of defending national interests.

Aidit made this statement on the evening of the 22nd when he received a delegation of people's representatives from Sumatra. He pointed out that some people are deliberately trying to say that the current domestic problem in Indonesia is a problem of communism versus anti-communism. These people say this in order to get more aid from imperialist countries. He pointed out that the Hussein rebellion group relies on "shouting communism" to imperialism for its survival.

Aidit said that at present, the Indonesian military and government authorities have taken a firm stand to fight against the rebels and resolutely stand with the people, which will inevitably lead to the ultimate failure of the traitors. He said that the current task is to further mobilize the people and unite all the people of Indonesia, first and foremost the strength of the people of the Riau Islands, Jambi, and West Sumatra. He believes this can be done.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 24th: According to Jakarta newspapers today, Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution said that the Hussein rebellion group is cooperating with foreign troops and the "Islamic State Movement" to smuggle weapons from abroad.

Nasution said that all connections between the Hussein group and foreign countries must be severed. He said that measures must be taken to prevent foreign countries from helping this group, preventing these foreign countries from shipping weapons or transporting weapons to other parts of Indonesia.

Nasution made these remarks on the 22nd in Jakarta in his capacity as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to about one thousand officers. He said that the main crimes of the Hussein group are: submitting an "ultimatum" to the government and the head of state, establishing a so-called "government," instigating foreign oil companies to refuse to hand over earned foreign exchange to the Indonesian central government, and demanding that the Dutch Royal Shipping Company and other foreign enterprises resume operations in Indonesia. In addition, it also attempted to win over areas such as Aceh, West Java, and Sulawesi to participate in their activities.

Nasution said that the government and the army authorities believe that the Hussein group should be sanctioned and that it is impossible to resolve the Central Sumatra incident through consultation, as some people have advocated.

Nasution pointed out that Indonesia still pursues an independent foreign policy and does not participate in any bloc.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 24th: Some newspapers in Jakarta today condemned the United States and the Manila Treaty Organization for interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs.

"Dongxing Daily" said that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' policy is the policy of the Manila Treaty Organization, which is to support the rebels in Central Sumatra. The newspaper said that there is no doubt that the United States is involved in activities against Indonesia.

"Dongxing Daily" pointed out that it has become increasingly clear that the Manila Treaty Organization is attempting to continue to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. The purpose of this military group's scheduled military exercises in the near future is obviously to threaten Indonesia. The newspaper said that while implementing a blockade against the rebels, strict blockade measures must be taken to prevent interference from the Manila Treaty Organization.

"Dongxing Daily" also cited some recent facts, such as the demonstration of the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the sea south of Luzon, Dulles' speech at the swearing-in ceremony of the new U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Jones, and the transportation of British armored vehicles to Central Sumatra, etc., believing that these all show the Manila Treaty Organization's intentions toward Indonesia. However, the Indonesian government and people are responding to the current new developments with closer unity and high vigilance.

"Indonesia Torch Daily" said that the purpose of the Hussein rebellion group's activities abroad is to drag Indonesia into a certain "defense" bloc.

    印度尼西亚共产党坚决保卫民族利益
    艾地断言叛乱分子最后必遭失败
    纳苏蒂安说必须制止外国向叛乱地区运送武器
    新华社雅加达24日电　雅加达“人民日报”今天刊载了印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地就目前国内局势发表的谈话。艾地说，目前印度尼西亚的问题是民族和反民族的问题。印度尼西亚共产党同其他党派一起，是站在保卫民族利益这一边的。
    艾地是在22日晚间接见苏门答腊人民代表团时发表这次谈话的。他指出，现在有人别有用心地硬说目前印度尼西亚国内的问题是共产主义和反共产主义的问题，这些人这样说是为了要从帝国主义国家那里得到更多的救助。他指出，侯赛尼叛乱集团是依靠向帝国主义“喊叫共产主义”过活的。
    艾地说，目前，印度尼西亚军事和政府当局已经采取坚决态度要同叛乱分子进行斗争，而且坚决地同人民站在一起，这使叛徒们最后必将遭到失败。他说，目前的任务是进一步动员人民和团结印度尼西亚全体人民，首先是廖内群岛、占碑和西苏门答腊的人民的力量。他相信这是能够做到的。
    新华社雅加达24日电　据雅加达报纸今天报道，印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安说，侯赛尼叛乱集团同外国军队和“伊斯兰教国运动”合作，私自从外国运入武器。
    纳苏蒂安说，必须切断侯赛尼集团同外国的一切联系。他说，必须采取措施使外国不能帮助这个集团，使这些外国无法运入武器或者把武器运到印度尼西亚的其他地方去。
    纳苏蒂安是22日在雅加达以三军参谋长联席会议主席身份向一千名左右的军官发表演说时这样说的。他说，侯赛尼集团的主要罪行是：向政府和国家元首递交“最后通牒”，成立所谓“政府”，怂恿外国石油公司拒绝把赚取的外汇交给印度尼西亚中央政府，要求荷兰皇家轮船公司和其他外国企业重新在印度尼西亚开业。此外它还企图拉拢亚齐、西爪哇和苏拉威西等地区参加他们的活动。
    纳苏蒂安说，政府和陆军当局认为侯赛尼集团应该受到制裁、像某些人所主张的那样通过协商去解决中苏门答腊事件是不可能的。
    纳苏蒂安指出，印度尼西亚仍然奉行独立的外交政策，不参加任何集团。
    新华社雅加达24日电　雅加达的一些报纸今天谴责美国和马尼拉条约组织干涉印度尼西亚内政。
    “东星报”说，美国国务卿杜勒斯的方针就是马尼拉条约组织的方针，也就是支持中苏门答腊叛乱分子的方针。这家报纸说，毫无疑问，美国参与了反对印度尼西亚的活动。
    “东星报”指出，马尼拉条约组织企图继续干涉印度尼西亚的内政，这一点已经越来越明显了。这个军事集团预定在最近举行军事演习的目的显然是为了威胁印度尼西亚。这家报纸说，在对叛乱分子实行封锁的同时，必须采取严密的封锁措施去防止马尼拉条约组织的干涉。
    “东星报”还举出最近发生的一些事实，如美国第七舰队在吕宋南部海面的示威，杜勒斯在新任美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯的宣誓就职典礼上的讲话，以及英国装甲车运到中苏门答腊等等，认为这些都表明马尼拉条约组织对印度尼西亚的目的。但是，印度尼西亚政府和人民正以更加紧密的团结和高度的警惕来应付目前的一些新发展。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，侯赛尼叛乱集团在国外活动的目的是要把印度尼西亚拖入某个“防御”集团。
