    Unite Under the Banner of Anti-Colonialism
    ——Congratulating the Birth of the United Arab Republic
    A new country has been born where Asia and Africa meet. On February 1st, Egyptian President Nasser and Syrian President al-Quwatli, along with delegations from both countries, signed a declaration in Cairo announcing the formation of the United Arab Republic, uniting Egypt and Syria. Subsequently, the parliaments of both Egypt and Syria passed the provisional constitution of the United Arab Republic. On February 21st, both countries held a referendum in which the vast majority of voters supported the union of Egypt and Syria and elected Nasser as the first president of the United Arab Republic. This is a major event in the political life of the Egyptian and Syrian peoples, and it is also a significant event in the current national independence movement. Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai have already sent telegrams to Nasser on behalf of the Chinese government and people, recognizing the United Arab Republic and expressing congratulations.
    The establishment of the United Arab Republic developed from the joint struggle of the Egyptian and Syrian peoples in defending their national independence. Both Egypt and Syria have suffered under the rule of colonialism. After achieving independence, both countries faced the same military, political, and economic threats from Western colonial powers. Therefore, for many years, Egypt and Syria have adhered to a policy of peace and independence, and have waged heroic struggles against colonialist aggression and to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty. This common aspiration and common struggle have made Egypt and Syria increasingly aware of the need to strengthen unity. The United Arab Republic was born on this common foundation.
    In the past few years, Egypt and Syria have taken many steps to strengthen unity and cooperation in the anti-colonialist struggle. In 1955, the two countries concluded a joint defense treaty. Under this treaty, the two countries established a joint armed forces command to jointly dispatch troops from both countries. Last year, the two countries also concluded an economic alliance agreement, a trade agreement, and a payment agreement, promoting economic cooperation between the two countries. Facts have proven that the unity and cooperation between Egypt and Syria are entirely in line with the common interests of the two peoples in defending national independence. When Egypt was subjected to military aggression by Britain, France, and Israel, the Syrian people immediately cut off the oil pipelines of the imperialist countries, powerfully coordinating with the Egyptian people's struggle to defend national independence. When the United States and Turkey amassed troops on the Syrian border, preparing to launch a military aggression against Syria, Egypt resolutely dispatched its own armed forces to Syria, jointly safeguarding Syria's security. Clearly, the establishment of the United Arab Republic will greatly strengthen the unity of the Egyptian and Syrian peoples, thereby benefiting the common anti-colonialist struggle.
    Due to the long-term plunder and exploitation by colonialists, the economies of Egypt and Syria are underdeveloped. While safeguarding national independence, the Egyptian and Syrian peoples are also urgently demanding to develop their own national economies and improve their living conditions. In this regard, further mutual assistance and cooperation between Egypt and Syria will not only make the existing economic ties between the two countries closer, but also, due to the combination of resources and manpower, will inevitably create more favorable conditions for the economic construction of the two countries.
    Precisely because of this, the Egyptian and Syrian peoples warmly celebrate the birth of their new country. On the day of the referendum, Cairo and Damascus were filled with a festive atmosphere, bustling with activity. Flags and huge banners were hung in the streets. Some banners read: "Our union is a major blow to imperialists and their agents," "Our union supports the struggle of Arab countries for freedom." This is the firm will expressed by the people of the newly born United Arab Republic to the world. At the same time, the establishment of the United Arab Republic has also been warmly welcomed by the people of other Arab countries. Many political figures in Arab countries believe that the establishment of the United Arab Republic is the starting point and foundation for the unity of Arab countries, thereby further strengthening the unity of Arab countries.
    An important means for Western colonial powers to invade the Middle East is to undermine and divide the unity of the Arab peoples, in order to achieve the goal of divide and rule, and defeat them one by one. For many years, colonial countries such as the United States and Britain have been using military blocs and other means in the Middle East and among Arab countries to create disputes and divisions, and in particular, have been deliberately attempting to isolate Egypt and Syria, the two countries that most resolutely uphold national independence. Therefore, the establishment of the United Arab Republic is not something that Western colonial powers want to see. Many newspapers and periodicals in the United States and Western countries openly express hostility towards the United Arab Republic and engage in various provocations. Recently, Syria captured a group of armed special agents. This group of armed special agents was the executor of a new conspiracy personally planned by Dulles at the Baghdad Pact meeting. They attempted to launch armed disturbances in Syria on the day the Syrian people held a referendum, creating an excuse for imperialist military intervention. However, this conspiracy has once again failed shamefully. There is no doubt that the establishment of the United Arab Republic will promote the Arab people to unite more closely under the banner of anti-colonialism.
    The establishment of the United Arab Republic will have a great impact on the situation in the Middle East. Syrian President al-Quwatli has announced that the new country will continue to pursue a policy of peace and neutrality. This shows that the establishment of the United Arab Republic will not only promote the unity of Arab countries, but also help consolidate peace in the Middle East. At present, all Arab countries face the following question: Should they follow the path of Egypt and Syria, pursue a policy of peace and neutrality, safeguard their national independence and state sovereignty, and strive to strengthen unity and cooperation among Arab countries? Or should they take another path, participate in the US military blocs and aggression plans, damage their own national sovereignty and national interests, and create discord and confrontation among Arab countries? Obviously, the first path is in line with the interests of the Arab nation, and also in line with the interests of peace in the Middle East and the world.
    China, Egypt, and Syria have all established friendly diplomatic relations. In recent years, our economic and cultural exchanges have continued to develop, and our mutual understanding and friendship have continued to deepen. The Chinese people have always supported and sympathized with the struggles of the Egyptian and Syrian peoples and the peoples of Arab countries to defend national independence and oppose colonialism. In his speech to the National People's Congress on February 10th, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, warmly congratulated the establishment of the United Arab Republic, and "sincerely hoped that the United Arab Republic will rely on the patriotic and democratic forces of Egypt and Syria to powerfully promote the strengthening of unity among Arab countries, defeat all conspiracies to split the Arab people, and achieve greater victories in the common struggle to safeguard national independence and oppose colonialism." We believe that the friendship between our country and the United Arab Republic will be further developed in the future. We would like to extend our warm congratulations to all the people of the United Arab Republic, and wish the United Arab Republic prosperity and strength!

### 在反殖民主义的旗帜下团结起来——祝贺阿拉伯联合共和国的诞生

    在反殖民主义的旗帜下团结起来
    ——祝贺阿拉伯联合共和国的诞生
    在连接亚非两大洲的地方，一个新的国家诞生了。2月1日，埃及总统纳赛尔和叙利亚总统库阿特利以及两国的代表团在开罗签署一项宣言，宣布成立由埃及和叙利亚联合组成的阿拉伯联合共和国。接着，埃及和叙利亚两国议会分别通过了阿拉伯联合共和国临时宪法，2月21日两国举行了公民投票，绝大多数选民拥护埃及和叙利亚联合，并且选举纳赛尔为阿拉伯联合共和国第一任总统。这是埃及和叙利亚人民政治生活中的重大事件，这也是当前民族独立运动中一个具有重要意义的事件。毛泽东主席和周恩来总理已经代表我国政府和人民致电纳赛尔，承认阿拉伯联合共和国并表示祝贺。
    阿拉伯联合共和国的建立，是埃及和叙利亚两国人民在并肩保卫民族独立斗争中发展起来的。埃及、叙利亚都曾经遭受殖民主义者的统治。在取得独立以后，两国又同样面临着西方殖民国家的军事、政治和经济的威胁。因此，多年以来，埃及和叙利亚都坚持执行了和平独立政策，并且为反对殖民主义侵略和维护民族独立和国家主权，进行了英勇的斗争。这种共同的愿望和共同的斗争，使埃及和叙利亚两国日益感到加强团结的必要。阿拉伯联合共和国正是在这个共同的基础上诞生的。
    过去几年来，埃及和叙利亚为了加强在反殖民主义斗争中的团结合作，已经采取了许多步骤。1955年，两国缔结了共同防御条约。根据这个条约，两国建立了联合武装部队司令部，联合调度两国部队。去年，两国又缔结了经济联盟协定、贸易协定和支付协定，促进了两国之间的经济合作。事实证明，埃及和叙利亚两国的团结合作，是完全符合两国人民保卫民族独立的共同利益的。当埃及受到英法和以色列的军事侵略的时候，叙利亚人民立即切断了帝国主义国家的油管，有力地配合了埃及人民保卫民族独立的斗争。当美国和土耳其陈兵叙利亚边境，准备对叙利亚发动军事侵略的时候，埃及也毅然派出了自己的武装部队到叙利亚，共同保卫了叙利亚的安全。很显然，阿拉伯联合共和国的建立，必然会大大加强埃及和叙利亚两国人民的团结力量，从而有利于反殖民主义的共同斗争。
    由于殖民主义者的长期掠夺和剥削，埃及和叙利亚的经济处于不发达状态。埃及和叙利亚人民在维护民族独立的同时，也迫切要求发展自己的民族经济，改善自己的生活条件。在这一方面，埃及和叙利亚进一步的互助合作，不仅将使原有两国的经济往来更为密切，而且由于资源和人力的汇合，必然为两国的经济建设创造更加有利的条件。
    正因为这样，埃及和叙利亚人民热烈庆祝他们的新国家的诞生。在举行公民投票的一天，开罗、大马士革一片节日景象，热闹非凡。街道上悬挂着旗帜和巨幅标语。有些标语上写着：“我们的联合是对帝国主义者和他们的代理人的重大打击”，“我们的联合支持阿拉伯国家争取自由的斗争”。这就是新生的阿拉伯联合共和国的人民向全世界表示的坚决意志。同时，阿拉伯联合共和国的建立，也受到其他阿拉伯国家人民的热烈欢迎。许多阿拉伯国家的政界人士认为，阿拉伯联合共和国的成立，是阿拉伯国家团结的起点和基础，从而将使阿拉伯国家的团结进一步加强。
    西方殖民国家侵略中近东的重要手段，就是破坏和分化阿拉伯各国人民的团结，以达到分而治之、各个击破的目的。多年以来，美英等殖民国家一直在中近东和阿拉伯各国之间利用拼凑军事集团和其他办法，制造纠纷和分裂，特别是处心积虑地企图孤立埃及和叙利亚这两个最坚决地坚持民族独立的国家。因此，阿拉伯联合共和国的建立，是西方殖民国家所不愿意看到的。美国和西方国家的许多报刊公开对阿拉伯联合共和国表示敌意，进行各种挑拨。最近叙利亚捕获了一批武装特务。这批武装特务，就是杜勒斯在巴格达会议上亲自策划的一个新阴谋的执行者。他们企图在叙利亚人民举行公民投票的那一天，在叙利亚发动武装骚动，为帝国主义进行军事干涉制造借口。但是，这一阴谋策划又可耻地失败了。毫无疑问，阿拉伯联合共和国的建立，将促使阿拉伯人民在反殖民主义的旗帜下更加紧密地团结起来。
    阿拉伯联合共和国的建立，对中近东局势将发生很大影响。叙利亚总统库阿特利已经宣布，新的国家将继续执行和平中立政策。这表明，阿拉伯联合共和国的建立，不仅将促进阿拉伯国家的团结，而且也有助于巩固中近东的和平。目前，所有的阿拉伯国家面临着这样一个问题：是走埃及和叙利亚的道路，执行和平中立政策，维护自己的民族独立和国家主权，并努力加强阿拉伯各国之间的团结合作呢？还是走另外一条道路，参加美国的军事集团和侵略计划，损害自己的国家主权和民族利益，并且造成阿拉伯国家之间的不和与对立呢？显然，第一条道路才是符合阿拉伯民族的利益，并且也是符合中近东和世界和平利益的。
    中国和埃及、叙利亚都已经建立了友好的外交关系。几年以来，我们之间的经济、文化交流不断发展，我们之间的相互了解和友谊不断加深。中国人民一向支持和同情埃及和叙利亚人民以及阿拉伯各国人民保卫民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争。2月10日，周恩来总理向全国人民代表大会的讲话中，代表中国政府和人民热烈庆贺阿拉伯联合共和国的成立，并且“衷心地希望阿拉伯联合共和国将依靠埃及和叙利亚的爱国民主力量，有力地推动阿拉伯各国加强团结，击破一切分裂阿拉伯人民的阴谋，在维护民族独立和反对殖民主义的共同斗争中取得更大的胜利”。我们相信，今后我国同阿拉伯联合共和国之间的友谊，将得到进一步的发展。我们谨向阿拉伯联合共和国的全体人民表示热烈的庆贺，并祝阿拉伯联合共和国日益繁荣昌盛！
