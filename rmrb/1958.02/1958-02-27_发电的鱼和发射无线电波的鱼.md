    According to current knowledge, there are about one hundred species of fish in the world that can generate strong electricity, and several species that have "radar devices" on their bodies, according to a recent issue of the Soviet magazine "Science and Life".

    The magazine said that these electric fish are mainly found in South America, the coast of Africa, and other tropical sea areas. Electric rays can generate currents with voltages up to 70 volts. Electric catfish can generate currents of 80 to 100 volts, or even higher. Electric eels can even generate currents with voltages as high as 300 to 500 volts (the voltage for general electric lights is 220 volts). These fish generate electricity to defend against attacks from other animals or to kill their prey. Some fish have electricity strong enough to paralyze people. Research shows that these fish all have special electricity-generating organs. This organ can generate electricity when needed, but the electricity is weaker the second time it is generated. In order to restore the original voltage, the fish must rest for a while.

    The magazine said that recently, an organ used to emit and receive electromagnetic pulses was discovered on the "Mormyrus" fish, which lives in the mud at the bottom of ponds in West Africa. This fish uses this natural "radar device" to see things clearly in opaque mud.

    Another fish called the "Nile Elephantfish" or "Water Elephant" also has this "radar device." This unique low-frequency electromagnetic wave "generator" grows on its tail. The radio waves it generates propagate into the surrounding space and are reflected back when they encounter something. The fish has a special organ on its dorsal fin that can receive the reflected radio waves. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

    发电的鱼和发射无线电波的鱼
    据目前已知，世界上约有一百种能发出强大电力的鱼，和若干种身上长着“雷达装置”的鱼，这是最近一期苏联“科学与生活”杂志说的。
    杂志说，这些能发电的鱼主要是在南美、非洲的海边和其它热带地区的海中发现的。电鳐能发出电压达七十伏特的电流。电鲶能发出八十到一百伏特乃至电压更高的电流。电鳗甚至能发出电压高达三百到五百伏特的电流（一般电灯用电的电压为二百二十伏特）。这些鱼发电是为了防御其他动物的袭击或击毙捕食对象。有的鱼电力强到能把人打麻木。研究表明，这种鱼全都有特殊的发电器官。在需要时，这个器官就可以发出电来，但在发第二次电时，电力就比第一次弱。为了恢复原来的电压，鱼必须休息一个时候。
    杂志说，前不久在西非一种生活在塘底淤泥中的“摩尔米鲁斯”鱼的身上发现了一种用来发射和接受电磁脉冲的器官。这种鱼利用这种天然“雷达装置”可以在不透光的淤泥里清楚地看见东西。
    还有一种名叫“尼罗长喙鱼”或“水象”的鱼也有这种“雷达装置”。这个独特的低频电磁波“发生器”长在它的尾部。它所产生的电波向周围空间传播出去，遇到某种东西就会反射回来。鱼的脊鳍上有一个特殊的器官可以接收反射回来的电波。（新华社）（附图片）
