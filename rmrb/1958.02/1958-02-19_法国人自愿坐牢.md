    Frenchman Voluntarily Goes to Jail
    In France, a man named Lagache went to court in early February and requested to be imprisoned. After questioning him, the judge felt that he was innocent and should be released. Lagache protested, saying, "Ah, please don't release me in this weather, I have nowhere to go."
    The judge, feeling helpless, asked him, "How long do you need to stay in prison?" Lagache replied, "A month is perfect, I can get my allowance in early March." So he got his wish and was sentenced to a month in jail.

    法国人自愿坐牢
    法国有一个名叫拉加什的男子，于2月初到法院投案，要求入狱。法官询问后，觉得他无罪，应予以释放。拉加什抗议说：“啊，千万不要在这种天气放我呀，我根本没地方好去。”
    法官无可奈何，问他道：“你需要呆在监狱里多少时候呢？”拉加什回答说：“一个月正好、我可以在3月初拿到津贴。”于是他如愿以偿地被判坐一个月的监牢。
