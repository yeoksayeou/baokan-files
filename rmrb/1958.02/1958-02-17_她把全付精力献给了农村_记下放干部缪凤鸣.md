    She Dedicated All Her Energy to the Countryside
    — A Record of Sent-Down Cadre Miao Fengming
    By Our Correspondent Zheng Qimin
    When I entered Donghu Village in Shahe County and asked about cadre Miao Fengming's performance after being sent down, an old man raised his thumb and waved it in front of me, saying, "Don't even mention it, she's good at labor, good at character, truly a good cadre sent by Chairman Mao." As he spoke, the old man led me to Miao Fengming's residence. Miao Fengming had already gone to the fields to work. When Zhang, the old woman who shared the bed with her, heard that I wanted to learn about Miao Fengming's situation, she immediately came out of the room and looked me up and down, saying, "Are you asking about our Fengming? She's so good! She goes to the fields every morning at the crack of dawn, and by the time I've spun two liang of cotton, she's just returned from teaching at the people's school." A twelve- or thirteen-year-old girl led me to find Miao Fengming in the pear orchard outside the village. As we reached the east end of the village, the girl pointed to a well and said, "Last night, my Sister Feng (referring to Miao Fengming) led us to catch sparrows in the well." When we arrived at the work site, it was break time. I thought to myself that this was a good opportunity to talk to her, but unexpectedly, she was busy teaching the commune members to sing "The People's Leader Mao Zedong" on a sunny spot of a sandy slope. Not wanting to disturb them, I stood behind and sang along.
    A Model in Production
    Donghu Village is famous as one of Hebei Province's major Ya Pear production areas. The day after Miao Fengming arrived in the village, she was assigned to the youth production team to prune pear branches. Pruning pear branches required climbing trees. Climbing trees, especially large pear trees ten or twenty feet tall, and then working on them, was a major difficulty for a young woman who had always lived in the city and never participated in physical labor. But Miao Fengming, a member of the Communist Youth League, overcame this difficulty after a period of arduous training. Recalling the situation at the time, she said, "The first day of work was learning to climb trees. Commune member Yan Shangchang taught me hand-in-hand, holding my feet and barely managing to get me onto a tree branch. When I looked down, oh no, I felt the ground moving, the sky spinning, my eyes blackening, my legs shaking, and my heart pounding. I held tightly to the tree trunk, afraid to move. The commune members laughed so hard they had tears in their eyes when they saw me like that. That night, I didn't sleep for half the night, thinking maybe I should just give up, it was so embarrassing. But then, I immediately dismissed the thought. I asked myself: Didn't you express your determination to the organization when you came down, guaranteeing to overcome all difficulties and be a good commune member? How can you lose heart when you encounter this little difficulty? So, my confidence in overcoming difficulties increased, and I continued to learn to climb trees when I went to work the next day..." After Miao Fengming persisted in this way for three days, she gradually became bolder and learned to climb trees and use ladders. However, the second difficulty came next, which was learning to stand on a tree branch, holding the tree with her left hand and pruning the branches with her right. This kind of labor relied entirely on the strength of the arms and wrists. According to Miao Fengming's physical condition at the time, she was clearly unable to do it. The second day she started pruning branches, her arms began to ache, her wrists became unresponsive, and blisters appeared on the palms of her hands holding the scissors. The production team leader asked her to rest, but she firmly refused. At this time, she thought to herself: "Only by persisting, and persisting again, can I overcome this difficulty and learn the real skills." While humbly learning pruning techniques from the commune members, she endured the pain and persisted in working. Sure enough, as she expected, after ten days of diligent study and hard practice, she overcame the second difficulty in labor, her physical strength gradually increased, her workload increased day by day, and her spirit became more and more cheerful. After twenty days, she fully mastered the pruning techniques, and her labor exceeded the level of ordinary commune members. She earned ten work points every day, and her work performance was very good, and she was unanimously selected by the commune members as a production model.
    A Good Teacher in the People's School
    After Miao Fengming initially mastered the pruning techniques and was able to work independently, she thought to herself: "Physical labor is my main occupation for labor training, but there is still a lot of work that the countryside needs me to do, so I must find some side jobs." One evening, she went to the village's people's school, looking here and asking there. She found that there were more than forty students on the school's roster, but only twenty or so were actually in class, and some were dozing off during class, while others slipped away halfway through, and they weren't very enthusiastic about learning. She took the initiative to find the students, the people's school teachers, and the farmers to understand the situation and analyze the reasons for the lack of enthusiasm for learning. Finally, she, the Youth League secretary, and the head of the commune jointly researched a way to improve and strengthen the work of the people's school. They divided the students into three classes according to their education level: advanced, intermediate, and elementary. In addition to specifically guiding the village's people's school teachers, she also served as the teacher of the advanced class. Because she took the initiative to assist the commune cadres in thoroughly rectifying the work of the people's school, and because she taught conscientiously and explained clearly, the students' enthusiasm for learning quickly rose. The number of students in this people's school has increased from more than twenty to more than eighty. She is not only responsible for teaching, but also pays special attention to the students' learning outcomes. In more than a month, she has held three exams and assigned essay topics for the students to learn to write. She often corrected students' homework until 12 o'clock at night. Student You Dewen said with emotion: "You can't find such a good teacher even with a lantern."
    An Excellent Propagandist of the Party
    Miao Fengming not only labored during the day and taught at the people's school at night, but also used the rest time during labor, before and after meals, and before meetings to read the newspaper to the farmers, tell allegro verses, and publicize the Party's various policies. She subscribed to a copy of the Hebei Daily, and every day when the newspaper arrived, she would skim through it and put it in her pocket, reading it to the farmers whenever she had the opportunity. One day, the newspaper published the news that Chairman Mao had gone deep into the alleyways of Hangzhou to inspect the residents' hygiene work. She used the rest time during labor to read it to the farmers twice in a row, and took this opportunity to publicize the benefits of eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene. Commune member Lu Gengchen said, "Chairman Mao attaches so much importance to eliminating the four pests, how can we be worthy of him if we don't do it well." So that night, the village caught more than a hundred sparrows. Combining the current central tasks of eliminating the four pests, practicing thrift, conscription, accumulating fertilizer, and building water conservancy in the countryside, Miao Fengming wrote fourteen propaganda materials and a one-act play "Grandma Li Sends Her Son to Enlist" in more than a month. In order to expand the propaganda team and publicize the Party's policies in a more vivid and lively way, she also actively assisted the village Youth League Secretary Zhang Fuzhen in organizing a cultural club with students from the people's school as the main members, and absorbed many active young and middle-aged farmers to participate in the work of the club, and stipulated that Saturday night would be the cultural entertainment time. At this time, she would guide the young people to rehearse dramas, learn to sing, or tell comic dialogues and allegro verses. Now they are rehearsing the one-act dramas "A Small Stream Flows Forever," which promotes thrift, and "Borrowing a Donkey," which educates commune members to cherish livestock, and are preparing to perform them during the Spring Festival.
    Her Heart is Linked to the Farmers'
    I asked Miao Fengming: You work in the fields every day and also take on so much social work, don't you feel busy and tired? She said, "When I first prepared to go to the countryside for labor training, I didn't even think I could do so much work. This is mainly because after arriving in the countryside, I saw the enthusiastic and sincere attitude of the villagers, and learned that the farmers, especially the young farmers, were all eagerly hoping that the educated youth who came to the countryside could give them more help, which moved me very much. Also, in my interaction with them, my thoughts and feelings have changed somewhat, and I always feel that I should try my best to do more things that are beneficial to them. With such a mood and determination, no matter how busy or tired I am, sometimes even so busy that I correct students' homework while eating, my spirit is very happy. Because my spirit is happy, my body is becoming more and more sturdy, so I don't feel too tired now."
    The eyes of the farmers are sharp. When they saw with their own eyes that the sent-down cadre Miao Fengming was working so diligently and trying every means to help them concretely realize the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program, their various incorrect views of her were quickly eliminated, and they all loved and cared for her from the bottom of their hearts. Even Lin Youde, the farmer who initially laughed so hard that he shed tears when he saw her legs shaking while learning to climb trees, and thought that intellectuals were making a fool of themselves by working, now praises her, saying, "Fengming is progressing really fast, she's a good cadre who is both literate and martial." Once, Miao Fengming caught a cold from leading the masses to catch sparrows at night and developed a high fever of thirty-nine degrees. When the villagers found out, they came to see her in groups. Zhang, the old woman, pointed to her daughter and Miao Fengming and said to me, "They sleep on my left and right sides, and I treat them equally." From this, you can see how much the villagers love the sent-down cadre Miao Fengming.
    The Spring Festival is approaching, and the villagers are preparing things for the festival. Some cadres who have been sent down to Shahe County have also asked the township and county for leave to visit relatives and friends in Beijing during the Spring Festival. I asked Miao Fengming, "Who else is in your family? Are you planning to go home to see them during the Spring Festival?" She said thoughtfully, "People miss their loved ones more during festivals, and I am the same. I have three lively and lovely children and a sixty-year-old parent, how can I not want to go home to see them?" I said, "Have you decided to go back to Beijing?" She shook her head and continued, "I originally wanted to go back to see them, but the villagers don't want me to leave." She pointed to the old woman Zhang and said, "First of all, she doesn't allow it. The old woman said that the things for the Spring Festival are all prepared, so let's have a good time together, mother and daughters! Also, the students of the people's school and the young people of the club, they also firmly don't want me to leave. They said that it is hard to wait for the Spring Festival, when there is a little free time, and they want you to guide us in performing plays. What will we do if you go back to Beijing?" With the expectations of loved ones on both sides, Miao Fengming hesitated for several days, and finally she decided not to go back to Beijing, but to spend this very meaningful Spring Festival with the villagers.

    她把全付精力献给了农村
    ——记下放干部缪凤鸣　　　
    本报记者　郑启民
    当我一走进沙河县东户村问起干部缪凤鸣下放以后的表现时，一位老大爷伸出大拇指，在我眼前晃了晃说：“别提啦，她劳动好，为人好，真是毛主席派来的好干部”。老大爷一面说着，一面领我到了缪凤鸣的住处。缪凤鸣早已下地劳动去了。与她同床睡觉的张老太太听说我要了解缪凤鸣的情况，马上从房里出来，上下打量我一番说：“你问的是俺凤鸣吗？她呀！可好啦，每天早上天刚蒙蒙亮就下地，晚上我纺了二两棉花了，她才从民校教书回来。”一个十二、三岁的小姑娘领着我到村外梨园里去找缪凤鸣，走到村东头，小姑娘指着一口水井说：“昨晚俺凤姐（指缪凤鸣）还领我们在井下捉麻雀呢。”到了劳动地点，正逢他们休息，这时我心想，正是同她谈话的好机会，不料她在一个沙岗的向阳处正忙着教社员们唱：“人民的领袖毛泽东”歌曲。我也不好打扰他们，只好站在后面随着唱起来。
    生产上的模范
    东户村是有名的河北省大鸭梨产地之一。缪凤鸣到该村的第二天就被分配到青年生产队，从事剪修梨枝的劳动。要剪梨枝必须爬树。爬树，特别是要爬一两丈高的大梨树，而且还要在树上进行劳动，这对一个一贯生活在城市，从未参加过体力劳动的青年妇女来说，确是一个大困难。但是共青团员缪凤鸣，经过一段艰苦的锻炼过程之后，终于克服了这个困难。她回忆当时的情况说：“开始劳动头一天，是学爬树，社员阎尚长掰着手教，并扶住我的两只脚，把我勉强弄到树叉上。这时，我往下一看，糟了，只觉得地在动，天在转，眼睛发黑，两腿直打哆嗦，心通通通地直跳，我两手紧抱住树干，一动也不敢动，社员们看到我这个样子，有的笑得眼里含着泪水。这天晚上，我半夜没合上眼，心想算了吧，这样多丢人，但后来，这个念头马上就打消了。我自言自语的反问自己：你下来时，不是向组织上表示决心，要保证克服一切困难，当个好社员吗？怎么能遇到这点困难就灰心了呢？于是克服困难的信心增强了，第二天一上工我继续学习爬树……。”缪凤鸣这样坚持了三天之后，胆子渐渐地大起来，学会了爬树和上立梯。然而第二个困难又接着来了，这就是要学会站在树叉上，左手抱树，右手剪梨枝。这种劳动，全靠两只胳膊和手腕的力量。根据缪凤鸣当时的体力情况，显然是不能胜任的。她开始剪枝劳动的第二天，两只胳膊就酸痛起来，手腕也有些不听使唤了，拿剪刀的手掌也起了血泡。生产队长让她休息，她坚决拒绝了。这时，她心里想：“只有坚持、再坚持，才能度过这一难关，学到真本领。”她一面虚心地向社员们学习剪枝技术，一面忍着疼痛，坚持劳动，果然不出她的所料，经过十天的勤学苦练，她克服了劳动中的第二个困难，体力逐渐地增长了，劳动量也一天天增加着，精神也愈来愈愉快起来。二十天后，她全面掌握了剪枝技术，而且劳动超过了一般社员的水平，每天挣十个工分，劳动成绩很好，被社员们一致评选为生产模范。
    民校的好教师
    当缪凤鸣初步掌握了剪枝技术，能够独立进行劳动以后，她心里想：“体力劳动这是我劳动锻炼的正业，但农村需要我做的活还多，必须找点副业干干。”一天晚上，她到了该村的民校，这里看看，那里问问。发现民校学员名册上有学员四十多人，但实际上课的只有二十几个，而且上课时，有的在打瞌睡，有的中途就溜走了，学习很不起劲。她主动去找学员、民校教师和农民了解情况，分析学习不起劲的原因。最后同团支部书记和社长共同研究出一个改进和加强民校工作的办法。按照学员的文化程度分高级、中级和初级三班。自己除了具体指导村里的民校教员之外，还担任了高级班的教员。由于她主动协助社干部彻底整顿了民校工作，而且教课认真，讲解清楚，学员们的学习热情很快高涨起来。这个民校的学员已由原来的二十多人，增加到八十多人。她不仅教学认真负责，还特别注意学员们的学习效果。一个多月来，她已举行过三次考试，并出作文题让学员们学习作文。她批改学员作业往往到深夜十二点钟才休息。学员尤德温感动地说：“打着灯笼也找不到这样好的老师。”
    党的优秀的宣传员
    缪凤鸣不但白天劳动，晚上在民校上课，她还利用劳动中的休息、吃饭前后和开会前的空隙时间，给农民读报、说快板，宣传党的各项政策。她订了一份河北日报，每天报一来，粗粗地看一下，就随身装在衣袋里，一遇机会就读给农民听。有一天报上登了毛主席在杭州深入里弄检查居民卫生工作的消息，她利用劳动中的休息时间，一连给农民读了两遍，并乘此机会向农民宣传了除四害、讲卫生的好处。社员卢更臣说：“毛主席都这样重视除四害，咱们如不好好干，怎能对得起他老人家。”于是当天晚上该村就捉了麻雀一百多只。缪凤鸣结合当前农村除四害、勤俭持家、征兵、积肥和修水利等中心工作，在一个多月中曾编写了十四篇宣传材料，和一个“李大娘送子应征”的独幕剧。为了扩大宣传队伍，更形象更生动地宣传党的政策，她还积极协助该村团支书张福珍以民校学员为主组织了文化俱乐部，吸收许多爱活动的青壮年农民参加俱乐部工作，并规定每星期六晚上为文化娱乐时间。在这个时间，由她来指导青年排演话剧、学习唱歌，或者说相声和快板。现在他们正在排演的有提倡勤俭持家的“细水长流”和教育社员爱护牲畜的“借驴”等独幕话剧，准备春节演出。
    她和农民心连着心
    我问缪凤鸣：你每天下地干活，又担任了这样多的社会工作，不感觉繁忙和劳累吗？她说：“当最初我准备下农村劳动锻炼时，连自己也没想到能做这样多工作。这主要是由于到农村后，看到老乡们热情、真挚的待人态度，了解到农民们特别是青年农民们都眼巴巴地渴望着下乡知识分子能给他们以更多的帮助的心情，使我很受感动，而且和他们相处中，我的思想感情也起了一些变化，总觉得应当尽量争取多做些对他们有益的事情。有了这样的心情和决心，工作再忙，再累，有时甚至忙得一面吃饭，一面批改学员的作业，而精神却非常愉快，由于精神愉快，身体也愈来愈硬梆了，因此，现在也不感觉太劳累。”
    农民的眼睛是雪亮的，当他们亲眼看到下放干部缪凤鸣这样勤苦地努力劳动，而且想尽一切办法去帮助他们具体实现农业发展纲要四十条的时候，对她种种的不正确的看法也很快消除了，而且都打心眼里爱护她、关心她。就连最初见她学爬树时两腿发抖，因而笑得直掉眼泪，认为知识分子劳动是出洋相的农民林友德，现在也夸奖说：“凤鸣进步真快，是个能文能武的好干部。”有一次，缪凤鸣由于晚上带领群众捉麻雀，着了凉，发高烧到三十九度。村里老乡们知道后，成群结队的来看她。张老太太指着她的女儿和缪凤鸣对我说：“她俩一个睡在我左边，一个睡在右边，我待她俩是一碗水平端，一模一样。”由此就可看出老乡们是怎样热爱着下放干部缪凤鸣。
    春节快到了，老乡们都在准备东西过节，下放到沙河县的干部，有些也向乡里和县里请了假，准备在春节回北京看望亲友。我问缪凤鸣：“你家还有什么人，春节准备回家看看吗？”她深有所思地说：“人逢佳节倍思亲，我也是一样，我家有三个活泼可爱的孩子，六十岁的老人，怎么不想回家看看呢？”我说：“你决定要回北京？”她摇摇头继续说：“原来想回去看看，但老乡们都不想叫我走。”她指着张老太太说：“首先，她老人家就不允许，老人家说过春节的东西，都准备好啦，咱娘们在一块美美地过个痛快年吧！还有民校学员和俱乐部的青年们，他们也坚决不让我走，他们说好容易盼个春节，有点空闲，要你指导我们演戏，你回北京了，我们怎么办呢？”在这两下里都有心连着心的亲人的盼望之下，缪凤鸣犹豫了好几天，最后她决定不回北京了，要同老乡们在一起欢度这个极有意义的春节。（附图片）
