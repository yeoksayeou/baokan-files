    Agricultural Science Should Promote the Development of Agricultural Production
    Representative Ding Ying said: Agricultural scientific research work should learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, utilize the rich assets accumulated from agricultural production practices over the past four to five thousand years, and closely integrate them with the wisdom and labor creation power of hundreds of millions of Chinese farmers to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural science and accomplish the glorious task of developing national agricultural production and even international agricultural science.
    I completely agree with and firmly support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.
    I would like to express some opinions on how agricultural scientific researchers in our country should do their work on the production front during the high tide of the national production great leap forward.
    Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao's proposal to simultaneously promote industry and agriculture on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, as well as the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the people of the whole country have been greatly encouraged and mobilized with high enthusiasm and a hundredfold confidence to advance on the road of socialist construction.
    Agricultural scientific research work lags behind the actual requirements of production, mainly due to problems of ideological understanding and working methods.
    Can our agricultural scientific research work achieve a great leap forward to meet the requirements on the production front? Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, China's agricultural science has made considerable achievements. For example, the promotion of improved crop varieties and close planting systems, the breeding of improved breeds of livestock and silkworms, the prevention and control of crop diseases and insect pests and livestock epidemics, and the accumulation of a considerable amount of scientific research data. However, compared with the rapid development of socialist agricultural construction in our country, especially compared with the mass water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation movements on a national scale since last autumn, agricultural scientific work lags far behind the actual requirements of production. For example, the identification of improved crop varieties, the testing of soil physical and chemical properties, the standards for rational fertilization, and the cropping systems of major crops in various regions have only achieved individual, scattered, and piecemeal results, and cannot be used as the basis for overall production planning. In particular, in recent years, although farmers' experiences in high-yield wheat, cotton, corn, sweet potatoes, etc. have continued to emerge. However, there has been very little scientific investigation, analysis, research, and summary to turn individual experiences and technologies into universal theoretical bases for promotion and gradual improvement. Some people believe that the reasons for these shortcomings are the professional level of our agricultural scientific researchers, but I believe that the most important should be the greatest relationship with our ideological understanding and working methods. Recently, I participated in the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution held by the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences and signed the scientific and technological cooperation plan between the Chinese and Soviet Academies of Agricultural Sciences, and took the opportunity to visit several agricultural colleges and agricultural research institutes in the Soviet Union. I feel that they have many valuable experiences in agricultural scientific research that deserve our serious study. Therefore, I offer a few opinions gained during my travels for comrades' reference.
    Summarize the production experience of farmers, study and solve the current problems in production, and make the research results connected with the actual production.
    I. The research directions of Soviet agricultural academies (schools) and specialized institutes (stations) are in accordance with the line decided by the Soviet Communist Party, seeking truth from facts to solve the current problems of agricultural production and the further development in the future, and every scientific worker regards making contributions to socialist production as the supreme glory, so that a set of comprehensive and relatively comprehensive scientific and technological measures can be researched in the production guidance of various crops, livestock, etc.; and according to the resolution of the 20th Party Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, further research and improvement are made on the existing production basis, and it is affirmed that the production level will exceed that of the United States when the Sixth Five-Year Plan is completed. Looking back at the agricultural production situation in our country, the outstanding production experience of farmers and the more or less research results of scientific workers should be affirmed, but the research results are not connected with the actual production, and they cannot complement each other to establish a relatively complete technical foundation. In the future, we should base ourselves on the outstanding experience of farmers in production, do a good job in summarizing experience, and realistically study and improve its existing problems or actual shortcomings, then we may be able to obtain the first step of relatively complete production technical measures.
    Research should be carried out according to the actual requirements of production, and valuable raw materials should not only increase the burden of custodians.
    II. Soviet research institutions and researchers attach great importance to and value Chinese farm varieties such as vegetables, fruits, beans, millets, and wheat. Once these things get into their hands, they may soon be bred into new varieties to meet the requirements of production and fill the information of doctoral dissertations. The breeding methods adopted by Soviet scientific researchers, such as continuous individual selection, sexual and asexual distant hybridization, and changing the environmental conditions of temperature and light, are known to Chinese scientific researchers. However, we are able to value these materials as valuable assets, and use specific conditions to adopt corresponding methods to carry out selection and breeding according to the actual requirements of production, so as to achieve the research purpose of serving production, which is very few. This is naturally greatly related to our scientific researchers' in-depth understanding of practical production problems, specific understanding, and our way of thinking or working methods. We should conduct in-depth inspections and work hard to improve, and we should not let thousands of valuable raw materials only increase the burden of custodians.
    Run science with the spirit of thrift and economy, and do not blindly greedy for more and better.
    Remove the academic research ideas that start from the individual and give full play to the potential power in agricultural scientific research.
    III. According to our situation of visiting Soviet agricultural colleges and institutes and stations for more than a month, all aspects of personnel allocation, work plans, and research equipment are realistic, simplified, and economical. For example, the five agencies of the Leningrad Institute of Plant Cultivation, the Institute of Plant Protection, the Institute of Agricultural Microbiology, the Institute of Agricultural Physics, and the Central Agricultural Library Branch, according to the statistics of Deputy Minister Yang Xiandong, have only 11,000 square meters of buildings; and the research achievements of each institute not only solve the production problems in the Soviet Union, but also make important contributions to the world. Another example is the Kuban Experimental Station, which leads the research work on rice cultivation in the Soviet Union. There are only 29 researchers, and the largest of the several research rooms is only more than ten square meters, and the indoor equipment is not rich; if precise experiments are necessary, they cooperate with the Kuban Agricultural College or the Moscow Botanical Research Institute, etc.; if rice breeding is carried out, they cooperate with state-owned farms, making use of all possible conditions to study and solve the most needed problems in production, and never aim too high or waste the country's financial and material resources. Recently, our Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences revealed in the anti-waste movement that they blindly greedy for more and better, and purchased unnecessary or unsuitable experimental equipment, totaling more than 46,000 yuan. There are many similar situations in other institutes. Such an ideological style is of course incompatible with the concept of running science diligently and thriftily and serving the cause of socialist construction.
    IV. There is also an important issue related to simplification and economy that deserves attention in the future. Due to the fraternal relationship between China and the Soviet Union, coupled with the signing of scientific and technological cooperation methods, visits to the Soviet Union will definitely be more frequent than before. In order to save manpower, financial resources, and time, I think that the best way to visit the Soviet Union in the future is to first obtain a general understanding from the overview report (which should be translated into Chinese) of the pre-scheduled visit agency before going abroad. After going abroad, the main purpose is to visit and visit specialized institutions, so that more abundant harvests can be obtained in a limited time; it is also hoped that the relevant leading departments can find ways to make a systematic visit plan, so that later visitors can get in touch with the former visitors from the foreign report, so as to achieve the purpose of visiting step by step, and to satisfy the Soviet side's desire for our warm reception. The fact is that Soviet comrades are very afraid that we do not understand enough, but not afraid that too much time is spent.
    V. The Soviet Union has become a country where agricultural production and agricultural science have developed to a considerable height in the world. However, in order to enable the scientific research forces between countries, especially socialist countries, to be strengthened and fully and effectively utilized as much as possible, the internationalist spirit of the working class is reflected scientifically. The method of expanding and consolidating international scientific and technological cooperation is specifically proposed to improve the productivity and research level of various countries, and to promote the early solution of major comprehensive problems in world science and technology, and to create new research and new achievements. Therefore, the signing of the Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation plan is of extremely great significance to the development of our country's scientific undertakings, and at the same time, it gives our scientific researchers extremely important education on the transformation of academic research ideas that start from the individual brought by the old society. Before today, when we wanted to coordinate the research work plan with the needs of production cooperatives, and when a research institution wanted to first put its main strength on comprehensive issues, many comrades could not understand it; but Soviet agricultural science workers have already taken a few steps forward, and they require sincere cooperation between international scientific workers, which should be seriously considered by our scientific research workers themselves and in the leadership in the future: how to cooperate with the needs of the national agricultural production plan, organize the national agricultural scientific research forces, implement division of labor and cooperation, so that comprehensive agricultural production problems can be comprehensively researched and resolved, and further the potential strength in agricultural scientific research in our country can be seriously brought into play to complete the scientific and technological cooperation tasks of China and the Soviet Union and other countries. Do a good job in scientific intelligence work as soon as possible; it is a waste to set up document rooms separately in each unit, and the results are minimal.
    VI. In addition, there is another problem. In order to prepare the conditions for doing a good job in agricultural scientific research, our Academy of Agricultural Sciences should do a good job in scientific intelligence work as soon as possible. If this work is done well, like the Soviet Union, if scientific researchers want to refer to something, they may be able to systematically supply something, which is equivalent to the foundation of scientific theory and working methods having building materials, and then they can be combined with our rich agricultural production data and the experience of production practice, then the problems existing in production practice can be gradually researched and resolved, and the level of scientific theory can also be gradually improved. At present, many agricultural colleges, institutes, stations, and even offices and groups have document rooms, which is a waste and the results are minimal.
    In general, our agricultural scientific workers should, under the correct leadership of the Party and on the road of socialist construction, and under the favorable conditions of Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation, earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the development of Soviet agricultural science, stir up revolutionary vigor, use the rich assets accumulated from agricultural production practices over the past four or five thousand years, summarize the superior experience, and at the same time closely integrate with the wisdom and labor creation power of hundreds of millions of farmers, to realize the great leap forward on the agricultural science front, and to complete the glorious task of developing national agricultural production and even international agricultural science!

    农业科学要促进农业生产的发展
    丁颖代表说：农业科学研究工作要学习苏联的先进经验，要把四、五千年来从农业生产实践中积累的丰富财产运用起来，同时与我国几亿农民的智慧和劳动创造力量紧密结合起来，实现农业科学的大跃进，完成全国农业生产发展以至国际农业科学发展的光荣任务。
    我完全同意李先念、薄一波两位副总理，彭真副委员长，和吴玉章主任的报告，并坚决地拥护。
    现就我国农业科学工作者在全国生产大跃进的高潮中，应怎样做好生产战线上的工作表示一些意见。
    自从中共八届三中全会和毛主席提出在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工农业同时并举的方针，以及全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的公布，大大鼓舞了和动员了全国人民以高度的热情和百倍的信心，向社会主义建设道路前进。
    农业科学研究工作落在生产实际要求后面，主要是思想认识和工作方法问题。
    我们的农业科学研究工作，能不能够实现大跃进，以配合生产战线上的要求呢？我国农业科学自解放以来，在党和政府的正确领导下，是取得了相当的成就的。如作物良种和密植制度的推广，家畜、家蚕的良种育成，作物病虫害和家畜疫病的防治，以及积累了不少的科学研究资料等。但拿我们的成就与我国社会主义农业建设的迅速发展比较起来，特别是拿去秋以来全国规模的群众性水利建设和积肥运动比较起来，农业科学工作就远远落在生产实际要求的后面。例如各地区的作物良种鉴定，土壤理化性状的测验，合理施肥的标准，主要作物的耕作制度等等，所做到的只是单干的、分散的、一点一滴的成果，而不能作为整体的生产规划的依据。特别是近几年来，虽然不断涌现农民种麦子、棉花、玉米、甘薯等等的丰产经验。但是通过科学性的调查、分析、研究和总结，使个别的经验、技术成为普遍的理论依据，而加以推广逐步提高，则做得非常不够。这些落后的原因，有人认为是我们农业科学工作者的业务水平问题，但我以为最主要的应该是与我们的思想认识和工作方法有最大关系。最近我因参加苏联农业科学院举行的十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念大会和签订中苏两国农业科学院的科学技术合作计划，并借此机会参观访问过苏联几个地方的农学院和农科研究所，觉得他们在农业科学研究上，有很多宝贵的经验值得我们认真学习，因而将个人在旅程中观感所得的几点意见，提供同志们参考。
    总结农民的生产经验，研究解决当前生产中的问题，使研究成果与生产实际搭上钩。
    一、苏联农业院（校）和专业所（站）的研究方向是遵照苏共决定的路线，实事求是地为研究解决农业生产的当前问题和今后进一步的发展而服务的，每一个科学工作者也以对社会主义的生产作出贡献为无上光荣，从而关于各种作物、牲畜等的生产指导上就能够研究出一套综合性的、比较全面的科学技术措施；并根据苏共第二十次党代表大会的决议，在已有的生产基础上作进一步的研究提高，肯定在第六个五年计划完成时就超过美国的生产水平。反观我国的农业生产情况，农民卓越的生产经验和科学工作者多多少少的研究成果是应该肯定的，但研究成果与生产实际搭不上钩，彼此不能相辅相成，以建立起较为完整的技术基础。今后我们就应该把农民在生产上的卓越经验做基础，做好经验总结工作，而实事求是地把它存在的问题或实际缺点加以研究改进，那末我们第一步的较为完整的生产技术措施就有获得的可能。
    根据生产实际要求进行研究，不应该让宝贵的原始材料只加重保管人员的负担。
    二、苏联各研究机关和研究工作者对于我国的农家品种如蔬菜、果类、豆类、粟类、麦类等是非常重视、非常宝贵的。这些东西，一到他们手里，不久就可能育成新种，以满足生产上的要求并充博士论文的资料。苏联科学研究工作者们所采用的育种方法如不断的个体选择、有性无性的远缘杂交、改变温、光的环境条件等等，是我国科学研究工作者所知道的。但我们能够重视这些资料作为宝贵的财产，根据生产实际要求，利用具体条件，采取相应方法来进行选育，以达到为生产服务的研究目的，则非常之少。这自然与我们科研工作者对生产实际问题的深入了解，具体领会和与我们的思想方法或工作方法有极大关系，应由我们深入检查，努力改进，而不应该让成千上万的宝贵的原始材料只加重保管人员的负担。
    本精简节约精神办科学，不要盲目地贪多贪好。
    去掉从个人出发的学术研究思想，发挥农业科学研究上的潜在力量。
    三、据我们一个多月来参观访问苏联农业院校和所、站的情况，所有在人员配置、工作计划和研究设备等方面，都是实事求是和精简节约的。例如列宁格勒植物栽培研究所、植物保护研究所、农业微生物研究所、农业物理研究所和中央农业图书分馆五个机关，据杨显东副部长统计，不过一万一千平方公尺的建筑物；而各所的研究成就不仅仅是解决了苏联国内的生产问题，还对全世界有重要的贡献。又如领导全苏稻作研究工作的库班试验站，研究人员只有二十九人，几个研究室中最大的不过十多个平方公尺，室内设备也不丰富；如有精密试验必要的，则与库班农学院或莫斯科植物研究所等合作；如水稻育种则与国营农场合作，利用一切可能利用的条件，以研究解决生产上最需要的问题，而绝不好高骛远，也不浪费国家的财力物力。最近我们农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所在反浪费运动中，揭发出他们盲目地贪多贪好，购置不必要或不适用的实验器材，计达四万六千多元，其他各所有类似情况的还不少，这样的思想作风跟勤俭办科学和为社会主义建设事业服务的观点当然是不相容的。
    四、还有与精简节约问题有重要关系今后值得注意的，是中苏两国由于兄弟般的关系，加上科学技术合作办法签订以后，前往苏联参观访问的，一定比以前更为频繁。为了节省人力、财力和时间，我以为今后赴苏访问的最好在出国前，先从预定访问的机关的概况报告（应译成中文）中获得一般性的了解，至出国后主要以专门性的参观访问为目的，使在有限的时间内，收获较为丰富；也希望有关的领导部门能设法作成一种具有系统性的参观访问计划，使后来者从出国报告中得与先往者取得联系，以达到逐次访问的目的，并满足苏联方面对我们热情招待的愿望。事实是这样，苏联同志们很怕我们了解得不够，而不怕时间花的过多。
    五、苏联已成为世界农业生产和农业科学发展到相当高度的国家，但为了使国际间，特别是社会主义国家间的科学研究力量能够尽量加强和充分有效地发挥起来，就从科学上体现工人阶级的国际主义精神，特别提出扩大和巩固国际科学技术合作的办法，以提高各国的生产力和研究水平，并促进世界科学技术上重大综合性的问题提早解决，以及创造性的新研究、新成就不断出现。从而中苏科学技术合作计划的签订对于我国科学事业的发展，就有极其重大的意义，同时也给我们科研工作者由旧社会带来的从个人出发的学术研究思想改造上以极其重要的教育。在今天以前，当我们要把研究工作计划配合生产合作社需要时，和要一个研究机构首先把主要力量放在综合性问题上时，是有很多同志思想搞不通的；但苏联农业科学劳动者已经走前几步，要求国际间的科学工作者真诚合作，这在我们科研工作者本身和在领导方面，今后都应郑重考虑：如何配合国家农业生产计划的需要，把全国农业科学研究力量组织起来，实行分工合作，使综合性的农业生产问题，获得综合性的研究解决，并进一步把我国农业科学研究上潜在的力量认真发挥起来，以完成中苏和与其他国家的科学技术合作任务。尽快办好科学情报工作；各单位分别设置资料室浪费多，收效微。
    六、此外还有一个问题，为做好农业科学研究工作准备条件的，就是我们农业科学院方面应该赶早把科学情报工作办好。如果这个工作办得好，像苏联那样，科研工作者要参考什么，就可能系统地供给什么，那就等于科学理论和工作方法的基础都有了建筑的材料，再能够同我们丰富的农业生产资料和生产实践的经验结合起来，那末生产实际存在的问题就可以逐步研究解决，科学理论水平也一定可以逐层提高。现在很多农业院校、所、站以至各办、组都有设置资料室的，浪费既多，收效也微。
    总的来说，我们农业科学工作者应该在党的正确领导和在社会主义建设的道路上，并在中苏科学技术合作的有利条件下，认真学习苏联农业科学发展的先进经验，鼓起革命的干劲，把四、五千年来从农业生产实践上所累积的丰富财产，运用起来，把优越经验总结起来，同时与几万万农民的智慧和劳动创造力量紧密结合起来，来实现农业科学战线上的大跃进，来完成全国农业生产发展以至国际农业科学发展的光荣任务！
