Remembering the Years of Pulling Rickshaws
杜晶铎
    "Rickshaw Boy" is a depiction of the suffering endured by us rickshaw pullers in the dark old society. It is a great education for those of us in this profession today, especially for the young people. For me, it stirs up old wounds. I pulled a rickshaw for fourteen years and pedaled a tricycle for seven years, and I will never forget the suffering of the past.

    In the old society, we rickshaw pullers were called "coolies," treated like beasts of burden. Who came up with the name "coolie"? It was Wu Bingxiang, the Commissioner of the Police Department, the authority directly ruling over us. He not only gave us the name, but also created a trademark and a number patch for us to wear on our backs. The number patch was a blue cloth, open-front vest, with the words "人力车夫" (Human-Powered Vehicle Driver) written in white with hydrochloric acid on the back, followed by the vehicle's number. The official price of each number patch was sixty cents, worth about twenty cents at the then current market price. If you forgot to wear it or wore it under your clothes, the police officers would arrest you and fine you twenty cents.

    The Commissioner gave us the name "coolie," but the police officers didn't call us that; they called us "livestock." For example, if we were carrying someone who needed a doctor, a midwife, or was in an emergency, we had to run fast. If the police officers saw us, they would shout, "Livestock, stop! Your straw basket is falling off!" We wouldn't dare not stop. When we stopped, the officers would come over and scold, "You must have eaten well to be running so fast. You want to get hit by a car (killed by a car)?" We had no choice but to plead, "Please forgive me this time. I won't do it again." If the passenger said something nice, the officer might be merciful and give you a kick, saying, "Get the hell out of here." We had to thank the officer even after being scolded and kicked. And that's not all. We were also regulated when driving empty. If we went to the west gate of Dong'an Market and a customer got off, we could only drive north with an empty car. If you went south, the officer would come over and snatch your seat cushion. If you asked for it back, he would beat you, no questions asked.

    Later, we got a new commissioner, Xue Zhiheng. He was even more innovative, replacing the number patches with license plates. When a new commissioner came, it was one replacement. But when the license plates were replaced, it was one for two. The previous one was a blue enamel plate, and it was replaced with two identical copper plates, mounted on the left and right sides of the car, one facing up and one facing down. Of course, it wasn't a free replacement. It cost twice as much as the blue plate. Even though the owner of the car paid the money, it still came out of our pockets. Each car fare increased by two copper coins. You had to pull no matter how much the price increased; if you didn't, you would starve. The commissioner said that the two plates were to make it easier for passengers to see and recognize, to prevent us from running off with their belongings. I really don't know what we rickshaw pullers had done to be treated like thieves. The police officers even made up a rhyme about us, saying, "Why are rickshaw pullers so beautiful? Foreign mules have two legs. They don't eat bran or feed, but they know every twist and turn."

    We rickshaw pullers looked forward to Sundays but feared them. We looked forward to Sundays because there would be more people and we could earn a few more coins. We feared Sundays because the soldiers (大兵) would ride without paying and would beat people for even asking. Sundays were the days when the soldiers came into the city to play and make trouble. They would come from Beiyuan or Huangsi, mostly walking. As soon as they entered the city, they wanted to ride rickshaws, getting on without asking the price. The soldiers wouldn't just sit quietly in the car; their mouths, hands, and feet were never idle. They would shout to run faster, faster, slap the armrests with both hands, and kick the splash guard with their feet. When he arrived, he would get out and leave, we did not dare to ask for the fare, only dare to say: "Sir, give me some money, so I can eat". He said, "What the hell, pull a rickshaw, and still want money." He glared at you, and he did not give you money, hey, he'd give you a belt. He swung his belt and lashed you all over your head and buttocks. We rickshaw pullers were beaten like this all the time. In the afternoon, when the soldiers had had enough fun and were about to return to camp, you were lucky if you met a better one. If you met a vicious one, he would be fine in the city, but once he pulled you to a deserted place outside the city, he would ask you to stop, and he would take out his gun and gesture at you, quickly take off your belt. To save your life, you had to hurry up and take it off, if you didn't, he would move his finger, and both you and the car would be finished.

    Whose soldiers were these? They were the soldiers under the command of Zhang Zuolin, the self-proclaimed General Zhenwu, who dared to provoke them? No one dared.

    Very few of us rickshaw pullers owned our own cars. Over ninety percent of us rented cars from the car owners. In the past, there were six or seven large car factories in Beijing, the worst of which was Ma Yanwang's car factory at Sanzhuanqiao outside Chongwenmen. Why was he called Yanwang (閻王, King of Hell)? At other factories, renting a car for half a day cost at most forty or fifty cents. At Yanwang's factory, it cost sixty-six cents for half a day. You could also owe a day or two of rent at other factories, but not at Yanwang's. If you owed rent today, he would confiscate your car tomorrow. If you didn't return the car for a few days, if Yanwang caught you, he would hang you up and beat you without asking questions, and you still had to pay the rent after the beating. Wasn't he a King of Hell?

    Our clothes, shoes, and socks were all worn out from pulling the rickshaw. If our pants and jackets were really unwearable, we had to find someone to introduce us to the "大爷们" (big shots) to borrow loan-shark money. If you borrowed one hundred strings of cash, you had to pay back one hundred and twenty strings in fifty days. But when you borrowed the money, you only received ninety-six percent of it, so if you borrowed one hundred strings, you only received ninety-six strings. After deducting the loan-shark interest for the day, which was two strings and four coins, we only received ninety-three strings and six coins, equivalent to two silver dollars and sixteen copper coins. After a few days, our shoes and socks would be unwearable again. What to do? We had to borrow again. This time, after all the discounts, borrowing one hundred strings only gave us forty-five strings and six coins. Who were these loan sharks? They were local ruffians and discharged police officers, or old soldiers who had made a fortune and retired. We felt that our fate was to just barely survive and wait for death, sooner or later to be food for dogs. But we couldn't even eat our fill and we couldn't die. We were living hell.

    We rickshaw pullers lived a desolate and miserable life in that man-eat-man society. No one loved us, no one sympathized with us. Why did we pull and run? To eat. We pulled and ran in the 1920s, we pulled and ran in the 1930s, we pulled and ran in the 1940s, until 1949 when the people who loved us and saved us finally came. We jumped out of the fire pit and were truly liberated. From then on, we tricycle drivers were no longer livestock, but workers, masters of our own destiny. The tricycles were returned to their rightful owners, the car owners were overthrown, and no one dared to bully us anymore. The police didn't hit or scold people, and our People's Liberation Army soldiers paid for their rides and were polite. We tricycle workers also attended the people's congress, and even the highest-ranking leaders called us "comrade." We eat with rosy faces and dress neatly. Who can say that this isn't true? Here, I would like to urge my old colleagues and new partners to be determined to follow the Party forward. We will listen to the Party and the government and take the socialist road.

    想起了拉洋车的年月
    杜晶铎
    “骆驼祥子”是写我们拉洋车的人在黑暗社会里所受的痛苦的。这给现在我们这行人很大的教育，尤其对我们这行的青年人更有教育意义。对我说来是见景伤情，我拉过十四年洋车，蹬过七年三轮，我决不会忘了过去的苦处。
    我们拉洋车的人，在旧社会里叫车夫，当牲口。车夫的名字是谁起的呢？是直接统治我们的衙门警察厅总监大人吴炳湘，他不但给起名字，还给作了商标、号坎，叫我们背在背上。号坎是蓝布对襟的小坎肩，在坎肩的后面用盐酸水写白字：“人力车夫”，下面写车的号码，号坎官卖每件六毛，按当时的市价评值两毛钱。如果你要忘了穿或穿在衣服里边，叫警察老爷们看见，就把你抓到区署，罚洋二毛。
    总监大人给我们起的名字叫车夫，可是，到了警察老爷们那里，就不叫我们车夫了，叫我们牲口。例如，要是我们拉上请大夫、请老娘婆或有急事的人，那我们就得快跑。这要叫警察老爷们看见，他们就叫：“牲口，站住！草簸箩掉了。”听见喊，我们不敢不站住。站住了，老爷们过来还骂：“料又足吃了，跑那么快，好给汽车打眼去（叫汽车撞死）。”没法，只有央告老爷：“您饶我这回吧，下次不敢了。”坐车人再说些好话，老爷开恩了，抬踹一脚：“滚他妈的蛋。”我们挨了骂，挨了踹，还得谢谢老爷。这还不说，我们放空车也要受管制，如果拉到东安市场西门，顾客下车后，我们只能往北放空车。你往南一走，老爷过来就抢车垫子。你一要，他就打，不客气。
    后来又换了一位总监薛之珩，他更新鲜，按号坎换车牌，换总监是一位换一位，换车牌吗是一个换两个。先前的是一个蓝搪瓷的，换的是两个一样的铜牌，安在左右扶车板上，一个字朝上，一个字朝下，不是白换，比蓝牌加两倍钱。虽说钱归车主拿呀，还不是羊毛出在羊身上，每辆车多涨两铜子，怎么涨你也得拉，不拉就得饿死。总监大人说，安上两个牌为的是叫坐车人看的清认的准，怕我们把坐车人的东西拉跑了。我真不知道我们拉洋车的怎么了，像防贼一样防我们。警察老爷还给我们编了一套词，说什么：“拉洋车的怎么那么美，外国的骡子是两条腿，不吃麸子不吃料，拐弯抹角都知道。”
    我们拉洋车的人是想星期怕礼拜，想的是星期日人多能多拉几吊钱，怕的是礼拜日老总（大兵）坐车不给钱，瞪眼就打人。礼拜日是老总进城玩闹的日子，他们由北苑或黄寺进城，大多数是走着来，他们只要一进城，就想坐洋车，也不问价就上车。老总们在车上并不是老老实实地坐着，他是嘴和手脚都不闲着，他嘴里喊快跑快跑，双手拍着扶车板，两脚就踹水簸箕，把他拉到了地方，下车就走，我们不敢说要车钱，只敢说：“老总你赏几个钱，我好吃饭呀。”他说：“咋的，他妈拉个八子，还要钱。”他把眼一瞪，给什么，不是钱，嘿，皮带。他抡起皮带连脑袋带屁股抽你一通。我们拉洋车的挨这样的打是家常便饭。到了下午，老总们玩够了该回营了，遇见好一点的就算万幸，遇到穷凶恶极的，在城里是没事，一拉到城外僻静地方，他叫你站住，他掏出手枪来朝你比划，快着把皮带给扒下来。要活命，你就得快快扒，你不扒，他二指一动，连人带车全完。
    这是谁的兵，是自命为振武上将军张大帅张作霖手下的兵，谁敢惹呀，没人敢。
    我们这行人拉自己的车是极少数，百分之九十几的人赁车主的车拉。在过去，北京有名的大车厂子有六七个，最恶的是崇文门外三转桥马阎王车厂子。他为什么叫阎王？在别的厂赁半天车，最多四十子到五十子，赁他半天车六十六个子，别的厂子还能欠一两天车份，到了阎王厂子，就不行了，你今天欠车份，明天他扣车。如果有几天不回车的，要叫阎王抓回来，他不问青红皂白，吊起来就打，打完了你还得给车份。这不是阎王吗？
    我们拉洋车的衣服鞋袜全是费的。如果裤褂实在不能穿了，当时要买一身，就得托人找大爷们，借一票印子钱。借一百吊，五十天还清，就得还一百二十吊。可是借钱是九六出，借一百吊出九十六吊，再扣当天一个印子钱两吊四，我们只能拿到九十三吊六，合现洋二元零十六枚铜子。过些日鞋袜又不能穿了，怎办？还得借。这回借，七折八扣，借一百吊只能到手四十五吊六。放印子都是哪些人呢？是地痞流氓和退了伍的警官老爷们，或发了洋财不当兵的老总们。我们只觉得我们的命运是混吃等死，早晚喂狗。可是，混吃哪，吃不饱，等死哪，死不了，我们是活受。
    我们拉洋车的人，在那人吃人的社会里，过着凄凉悲惨的生活，没有人爱我们，没有人同情我们。我们为什么拉呀跑呀，为了吃。一九二几年拉呀跑呀，一九三几年拉呀跑呀，一九四几年拉呀跑呀，直到一九四九年才来了爱我们的人，救我们的人。我们从火坑里跳出来，真正解放了。从此，我们蹬三轮的不再是牲口，而是工人，是当家做主人。三轮车是物归原主，车主打倒了，再也没有人敢欺侮我们了。民警不打人也不骂人，我们的子弟兵坐车给钱、和气。我们三轮车工人一样出席代表会，多大的首长也叫我们同志。我们吃的满面红光，穿的整整齐齐。这谁能说不是真的？我在这里要求我的老同行，新伙伴们，要决心跟着党前进，我们听党和政府的话，要走社会主义的道路。
