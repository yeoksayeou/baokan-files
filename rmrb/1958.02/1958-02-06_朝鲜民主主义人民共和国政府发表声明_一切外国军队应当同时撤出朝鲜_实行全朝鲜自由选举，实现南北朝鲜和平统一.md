Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th: The Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held a plenary session on the 5th. The meeting was attended by Premier Kim Il-sung, Vice Premiers Kim Il, Hong Myong-hui, Jeong Il-yong, Nam Il, Jeong Jun-taek, and cabinet ministers. Members of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, headed by Choi Yong-kun, members of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and heads of various departments, members of the presidium of the Korean Fatherland Front, and heads of various social organizations attended the meeting as observers.

Premier Kim Il-sung presented to the cabinet meeting a series of important measures for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland in the current domestic and international situation of Korea.

After discussing the issues raised by Premier Kim Il-sung, the meeting adopted a statement by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The full text of the statement is as follows:

It has been more than twelve years since Korea was liberated from the shackles of Japanese imperialist colonial rule, and it has been more than four years since the signing of the armistice agreement that ended the disaster of the three-year war imposed on the Korean people by the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee clique.

However, Korea has still not been reunified. The Korean people continue to suffer in the unfortunate state of a divided country.

The entire Korean people yearn for the artificial barriers that divide the North and South to be eliminated as soon as possible and for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland to be achieved.

Based on the unanimous wishes of the entire Korean people, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly put forward a series of reasonable proposals to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and has made efforts to facilitate its realization.

However, the United States and the South Korean authorities have unconditionally rejected the just proposals of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, opposed the peaceful reunification of Korea, and advocated "reunification by force." The South Korean authorities have even brutally suppressed and persecuted South Korean people, political parties, and political figures who have slightly expressed their desire for peaceful reunification, using "violation of national policy" as a pretext.

The United States and the South Korean authorities are systematically undermining the armistice agreement, exacerbating tensions in Korea. They have unilaterally refused to abide by the most important clause in the armistice agreement regarding the prohibition of increasing military strength in Korea and are actively transporting new types of weapons into South Korea and establishing atomic weapons bases.

Today, in South Korea, which is occupied by American imperialists, the people's slightest democratic freedoms are stifled; the economy is dependent on the United States, and national industries and small and medium-sized enterprises are on the road to increasing decline; the rural economy has also been severely damaged, and the number of grain-deficient farmers and farmers who have abandoned agricultural production is increasing year by year. South Korea, which was once a grain exporting region, has now become a grain-deficient region that imports millions of bushels of grain every year.

As a result, there are millions of unemployed people wandering the streets in South Korea today, and the people's lives are in a miserable situation.

The delay in resolving the Korean reunification issue will only deepen the suffering of the South Korean people and the national misfortune of the Korean people.

More than twelve years of national division has completely hindered the unified development of our national economy and national culture, and even the unified development of the national language used by our people for generations has been hindered.

Family members and friends of the same ethnicity who are separated in the North and South cannot meet, and even have no contact. This extremely unreasonable phenomenon cannot continue. The failure to achieve peaceful reunification of the fatherland for a long time has posed an increasingly serious threat to peace in Korea. The fundamental reason for the worsening plight of South Korea lies in the continued occupation of South Korea by American troops.

In particular, it must be pointed out that recently, American and South Korean troops have conducted large-scale atomic war exercises near the military demarcation line.

American military commanders and South Korean warmongers such as Syngman Rhee do not conceal their intention to wage a new war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and openly clamor that atomic weapons have been transported into South Korea, thereby posing a serious threat to peace in Korea.

In this critical period, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that it is its solemn duty to take appropriate measures once again in order to eliminate the threat to peace, ease tensions, and promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

It is impossible to solve the Korean problem by means of armed aggression planned by the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique.

The Korean problem should and can only be resolved in a peaceful manner, that is, through consultation and negotiation.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the issue of the peaceful reunification of Korea are mature issues that should be resolved immediately. The following measures should be taken quickly:

First, in order to ease tensions in Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean issue, American troops and all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, should simultaneously withdraw from North and South Korea. To this end, countries with troops stationed in Korea should quickly take corresponding measures to withdraw their troops from Korea immediately.

The occupation of South Korea by American troops is unjustified, no matter what the excuse; at the same time, there is no basis for American troops to continue to remain in South Korea.

Second, after all foreign troops have completely withdrawn from North and South Korea, free elections should be held throughout Korea within a certain period of time. The elections can be conducted under the supervision of a neutral nations supervisory commission. During the election process, the democratic rights of the people should be guaranteed and they should be able to freely express their will.

To this end, freedom of activity of all political parties, social organizations, and political and social figures in North and South Korea, as well as freedom of speech, publication, and association, should be legally permitted everywhere in North and South Korea. The current suppression of political party activities and freedom of speech in South Korea should be strictly prohibited.

Third, in order to discuss issues such as economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea and elections throughout Korea, consultations between North and South Korea should be realized as soon as possible on an equal footing.

Freedom of communication and free travel of peaceful residents between North and South Korea should be permitted.

Economic exchanges between North and South Korea can be carried out first at certain locations established by each side.

In order to unify the development of the national language and other national cultures, scholars, cultural, artistic, and sports figures from North and South Korea should be allowed to contact each other and carry out joint activities between them.

Fourth, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has reduced its armed forces by 80,000 people. The number of troops in North and South Korea should be reduced to the minimum possible level in the shortest possible time in the future.

The South Korean authorities should immediately respond to the legitimate proposal of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to reduce armaments in North and South Korea in order to ease tensions between North and South Korea, and must reduce the excessive military expenditures borne by the South Korean people to maintain the expanded "national defense forces."

At a time when the fate of the fatherland and the nation is seriously threatened, all Koreans with a national conscience, regardless of political views or social status, should unite closely under the banner of peaceful reunification of the fatherland and bravely fight to realize the fatherland reunification plan of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in order to achieve the reunification and independence of the fatherland and defend the honor of the nation.

This is the paramount national task that every Korean should undertake at present.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is confident that the implementation of the above measures will make a great contribution to the peaceful reunification of Korea and the maintenance of peace in the Far East, and hopes that the governments and peoples of all countries concerned with maintaining peace in Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue will give due attention to this statement.

　　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发表声明
    一切外国军队应当同时撤出朝鲜
    实行全朝鲜自由选举，实现南北朝鲜和平统一
    新华社平壤5日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁在5日举行了全体会议。参加会议的有内阁首相金日成、副首相金一、洪命熹、郑一龙、南日、郑准泽和内阁各相。以崔庸健为首的朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会成员、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会常务委员会委员和各部部长、朝鲜祖国战线议长团成员和各社会团体负责人列席了会议。
    金日成首相向内阁会议提出了在目前朝鲜国内和国际形势下和平统一祖国的一系列重要措施。
    会议在对金日成首相提出的问题进行讨论以后，通过了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府声明。声明全文如下：
    朝鲜从日本帝国主义的殖民统治桎梏下获得解放已经有十二年以上，使美国侵略者和李承晚集团强加在朝鲜人民身上的三年战争的惨祸得到终结的停战协定的签订，也已经过了四年多了。
    但是，朝鲜仍旧没有得到统一。朝鲜人民继续在国土遭到分裂的不幸状态下忍受痛苦。
    全体朝鲜人民渴望分裂南北的人为障碍能够早日消除，并且达成祖国的和平统一。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府根据全体朝鲜人民的一致愿望，屡次提出为促进祖国和平统一的一系列合理方案，并且为促使它的实现进行了努力。
    但是，美国和南朝鲜当局无条件地拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的公正建议，反对朝鲜的和平统一，提倡“武力统一”。甚至于南朝鲜人民、政党和政界人士只要对和平统一略有表示，南朝鲜当局就以“违反国策”为借口，加以残酷的镇压和迫害。
    美国方面和南朝鲜当局对停战协定进行系统的破坏，加剧了朝鲜的紧张局势。他们单方面地拒绝遵守停战协定中关于禁止在朝鲜增强武力的最重要的条款，并且正在积极把新型武器运入南朝鲜，建立原子武器基地。
    今天，在美帝国主义者侵占下的南朝鲜，人民的些微的民主自由权利都被扼杀；经济附属于美国，民族工业和中小企业正在走向日益没落的道路；农村经济也遭到了严重的破坏，绝粮农户和放弃农业生产的农户年年激增，曾经是粮食出口地区的南朝鲜目前变成了每年进口几百万石粮食的缺粮地区。
    结果是：在今天的南朝鲜有为数几百万人的失业大军在街头彷徨，人民生活陷入了悲惨的境地。
    朝鲜统一问题的拖延不决只会加深南朝鲜人民的痛苦和朝鲜人民的民族不幸。
    十二年多的国土分裂的结果，完全阻碍了我国民族经济和民族文化的统一发展，甚至我国人民世世代代所沿用的国语的统一发展也遭到妨碍。
    南北分离的本族亲友不能相会，甚至音信断绝。这种极端不合理的现象不能再继续下去。祖国和平统一的迟迟不能实现，朝鲜的和平受到了日益严重的威胁。南朝鲜的悲惨处境愈益加深的基本原因就在于美国军队继续侵占南朝鲜。
    特别要指出的是：最近，美军和南朝鲜军队在军事分界线附近进行了大规模的原子战争演习。
    美军指挥官和李承晚等南朝鲜的好战分子并不掩饰他们要进行反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的新战争，公然叫嚣已经把原子武器运入南朝鲜，从而使朝鲜的和平遭到了严重的威胁。
    在这严重的时期，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为：为了消除对和平的威胁，缓和紧张局势和促进祖国的和平统一，再一次采取适当的措施是自己的崇高的义务。
    用美帝国主义和李承晚集团所策划的武装进攻的办法是决不可能解决朝鲜问题的。
    朝鲜问题应当而且只有采取和平的方式，即协商和会谈的方式，才能获得解决。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为，从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队和朝鲜的和平统一问题是已经成熟的、应当立即解决的问题。应当迅速采取下列措施：
    一、为了缓和朝鲜的紧张局势以及和平解决朝鲜问题，美军和包括中国人民志愿军在内的一切外国军队应当同时撤出南北朝鲜。为此，在朝鲜派有军队的国家应当迅速采取相应措施，把本国的军队立刻撤出朝鲜。
    美军对南朝鲜的侵占，不论以什么为借口都是不正当的；同时，也不存在美军继续留在南朝鲜的任何根据。
    二、在一切外国军队全部撤出南北朝鲜以后，应当在一定时期内实行全朝鲜的自由选举。选举可以在中立国机构的监督下进行。在选举过程中应当保障人民的民主权利，并且使他们能够自由地表示意志。
    为此，无论在南北朝鲜的任何地方都应当在法律上允许南北朝鲜的一切政党、社会团体和政治社会界人士的活动自由以及言论出版和结社自由。目前在南朝鲜对政党的活动和言论自由所进行的镇压，应当严加禁止。
    三、为了讨论南北朝鲜之间的经济、文化交流和全朝鲜选举等问题，应当在对等的基础上早日实现南北朝鲜之间的协商。
    应当允许南北朝鲜之间的通信自由和和平居民的自由来往。
    南北朝鲜之间的经济交流可以首先在双方各自设立的一定地点进行。
    为了使国语和其他民族文化的统一发展，应当使南北朝鲜的学者以及文化、艺术和体育界人士进行接触，并且开展他们之间的共同活动。
    四、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已经裁减了武装部队八万人。应当在今后尽量短的时期内把南北朝鲜军队的人数缩减到最低限度。
    南朝鲜当局应当立即响应朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于缩减南北朝鲜军备的这一正当建议，以缓和南北朝鲜之间的紧张局势，并且必须减轻南朝鲜人民为维持扩张了的“国防军”而担负的过重的军费。
    在目前祖国和民族的命运遭到严重威胁的情况下，一切有民族良心的朝鲜人，都应当不分政治见解和社会地位，紧密地团结在和平统一祖国的旗帜下，为实现朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的祖国统一方案进行勇敢的斗争，以争取祖国统一独立和捍卫民族的荣誉。
    这是目前每个朝鲜人所应担负的高于一切的民族任务。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府深信上述措施的实现将为朝鲜的和平统一和维护远东和平作出巨大的贡献，并且期望所有关心在朝鲜维护和平和和平解决朝鲜问题的国家的政府和人民，对本声明给予应有的关心。
