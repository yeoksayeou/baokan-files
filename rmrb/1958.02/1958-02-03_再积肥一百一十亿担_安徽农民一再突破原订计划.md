Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, February 2nd: In less than three months, Anhui Province exceeded its annual fertilizer accumulation task of 11 billion dan by over 200 million dan. This figure is equivalent to the total fertilizer accumulated in the previous two years combined. Now, Anhui Province has proposed a new task of accumulating another 11 billion dan of fertilizer.

The peasants in Anhui Province have a great enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer, with 3.5 million people participating in the fertilizer accumulation campaign every day, closely integrating it with other winter production activities. According to statistics from Fuyang and Bengbu Special Districts alone, peasants have accumulated over 3.2 billion dan of mud fertilizer in conjunction with water conservancy construction. Various localities have also accumulated large amounts of fertilizer by cleaning up garbage and replacing old walls with soil in conjunction with the Four Pests Elimination Campaign. Rice-producing areas combine winter rice borer control with the composting of pulled-out rice straw roots and weeds. At the same time, various localities have also promoted various fertilizer production methods to manufacture various fertilizers.

The large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign in Anhui Province has resulted in more than 84% of the province's summer crops being top-dressed with fertilizer, and fertilizer has been reserved for spring sowing. The fertilizer accumulation campaign has also changed the old habit of "no toilets for people, no pens for pigs" in the areas along the Huai River. The 90,000 fertilizer construction teams in this area have built and renovated more than 2.21 million toilets and 1.65 million pig and sheep pens and cattle sheds.

　　再积肥一百一十亿担
    安徽农民一再突破原订计划
    新华社合肥2日电　安徽省在不到三个月的时间内，就超额两亿担完成了全年积肥一百一十亿担的任务。这一数字相当于前年和去年两年积肥的总量。现在，安徽省又提出再积肥一百一十亿担的新任务。
    安徽省农民积肥的干劲很大，每天有三百五十万人投入积肥运动，并且和其他各项冬季生产紧密结合进行。仅据阜阳、蚌埠两专区统计，农民结合修水利就积泥肥三十二亿多担。各地结合除四害运动，清扫垃圾、拆旧墙换土，也积聚了大量肥料。水稻产区结合冬季治螟虫，把拔出的稻草根和杂草沤制肥料。同时，各地还推广了各种造肥的办法，制造各种肥料。
    安徽省开展大规模的积肥运动的结果，使全省84％以上的午季作物已追上了肥，并为春播储备了肥料。积肥运动也使沿淮河地区改变了“人无厕所、猪无圈”的千年旧习惯，这一地区的九万个积肥基建队已修建和改建厕所二百二十一万多个、猪羊圈和牛栏一百六十五万多个。
