More Attendance, More Production
Yuxi Prefecture Breaks Convention to Celebrate Spring Festival

(Our newspaper, Yuxi, 19th) The people of Yuxi Prefecture in Yunnan Province responded to the call of "Breaking convention to celebrate the Spring Festival" with unprecedentedly high labor enthusiasm. During the two days of Lunar New Year's Eve and the first day of the Lunar New Year, the phenomenon of migrant workers at water conservancy projects being absent without reason almost disappeared. In Naxi Commune on the Manyang Ditch in Yuanjiang County, the attendance rate of migrant workers used to be only around 80%, but during the Spring Festival, it rose to 100%. At the Luowu River Reservoir in Jinning County, migrant workers greeted the Spring Festival by starting work early and carrying thirty loads of earth per person. At the same time, labor efficiency has also improved. At the Shihe Reservoir in Jiangchuan County, the average amount of earthwork per person per day in the past was no more than two cubic meters, but yesterday it reached three cubic meters. The total attendance rate of farmers in Jiangchuan County reached 90%. In the Fifth District of Yuxi County, more than 3,500 laborers were mobilized on the first day of the Lunar New Year, accumulating more than 11,500 loads of fertilizer, digging 45 mu of fields, and tidying up 13.5 mu of seedling fields. In Nancun Commune in Jinning County, each person accumulated ten loads of fertilizer and sent it to the commune as a Spring Festival gift on Lunar New Year's Eve and the first day of the Lunar New Year, and each team donated wooden boards to make 30 small carts.

During the two days of Lunar New Year's Eve and the first day of the Lunar New Year, cadres from the special district, county, district, and township levels, as well as teachers and students from many schools, went to the construction sites to offer comfort to the migrant workers. The female comrades helped the migrant workers mend and wash clothes, and the male comrades joined in the labor, and short-term get-togethers were held. The migrant workers said that this is a socialist New Year, a year of the Great Leap Forward, and a year of great unity.

    多出勤　多生产
    玉溪专区打破常规过春节
    本报玉溪19日电　云南省玉溪专区的人们以无比高涨的劳动热情响应了“打破常规过春节”的号召。在除夕和大年初一两天中，各地水库工程的民工无故缺勤的现象几乎绝迹。元江县漫洋大沟上的南溪社民工过去出勤率一直只在80％左右，春节期间竟上升到100％。晋宁县罗武河水库的民工以提早上班、每人挑土三十挑来迎接春节。与此同时，劳动效率也都有了提高。江川县石河水库，过去每人每天平均土方不超过两方，昨天达到了三方。江川县农民总出勤率达到了90％。玉溪县第五区，初一出动了三千五百多个劳动力，积肥一万一千五百多挑，挖田四十五亩，并整理了秧田十三亩半。晋宁县南村社，在除夕和初一两天中，每人都积了十挑肥料送给社里作为春节的礼物，并捐出木板每队制了小推车三十张。
    在除夕和初一两天中，专、县、区、乡的干部、许多学校的师生，都到工地上慰问民工，参加慰问的人女同志帮民工补洗衣服，男同志一道参加劳动，并作了短时的联欢。民工们说这是过社会主义的年，是大跃进的年，是大团圆的年。
