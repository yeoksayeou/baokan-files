    Tianjin First Technical School Challenges Xi'an First Aviation Technical School
    Fully Self-Sufficient, Training 300 Technicians Annually
    (Our report) After seeing the report on the front page of this newspaper on January 22 about Xi'an First Aviation Technical School's work-study program and self-sufficiency, the staff of Tianjin First Technical School, under the Tianjin Municipal Labor Bureau, decided after discussion to issue a friendly challenge to Xi'an First Aviation Technical School, mutually encouraging each other to boost revolutionary vigor and complete the task of running the school thriftily and cultivating talent.
    The competitive goals of Tianjin First Technical School are: to achieve complete financial self-sufficiency this year, and strive to accumulate surplus. In addition to providing the state with 300 young technicians with intermediate technical worker skills each year, this year they will also produce 110 C615 lathes, 80 belt-driven lathes, 14 shapers, 50 bench drills, and a number of C615 lathe components, hoisting machinery castings, and other processed parts for collaborating factories. The planned output value for this year is 1.04 million yuan.
    This technical school currently has 604 students and staff members. It has grown from scratch through five years of hard work. The school was formed in 1955 by merging three existing technical training classes. These training classes were mostly established after the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements in 1952, based on small factories taken over by the government. These small factories had dilapidated and narrow buildings, and old and broken machines. Later, a batch of machine wreckage from a military factory burned down by the Kuomintang was purchased from Liuzhou, Guangxi, at the price of scrap iron. The basic equipment of these training classes at that time consisted of these old machines that teachers and students repaired while learning. At that time, students had no classrooms, no desks and chairs, and not even a decent blackboard. When there was a shortage of practical training equipment, the problem was solved by practicing in four shifts day and night. In 1955, some classrooms and practice fields were rebuilt on the site of a burlap processing factory that had been destroyed by fire, and some more precise machines were added.
    Since the time of the training classes, Tianjin First Technical School has implemented a teaching policy that focuses on practical production, and strives to meet the needs of practical training by making its own tools and machines or processing parts. Some of the belt-driven lathes, vices, hand hammers, bending rulers, scribing plates and other tools used in the school are self-made. They have not only established cooperative relationships with some large factories in the city, helping these collaborating factories to manufacture more precise machine parts, but also, on the basis of gradually improving the level of production technology, successfully trial-produced a Soviet-style C615 lathe last year, which has been tested and meets national standards. By the end of last year, they had manufactured 17 such lathes.
    From 1954 to last year, the school has trained more than 1,400 technical workers for the state, and they have been utilizing the skills they have learned in various production positions.

### 天津第一技工学校向西安第一航空技工学校挑战  完全自给自足每年培养三百名技工

    天津第一技工学校向西安第一航空技工学校挑战
    完全自给自足每年培养三百名技工
    本报讯　天津市劳动局所属第一技工学校的工作人员们看到了1月22日本报第一版关于西安第一航空技工学校半工半读自给自足的报道以后，经过大家讨论决定向西安第一航空技工学校提出友谊挑战，互相激励共同鼓起革命干劲，完成勤俭办校培养人才的任务。
    天津第一技工学校的竞赛目标是：在今年就要作到经费完全自给自足，并且争取有积累。除每年交给国家三百名具有中级技术工人水平的青年技术工人以外，今年还要为国家生产C615车床一百一十台，皮带车床八十台，牛头刨床十四台，台钻五十台以及若干给协作厂制造的C615车床的部件、起重机械铸件和其他加工部件等。今年计划产值达到一百零四万元。
    这个技工学校目前有六百零四名学生和教工人员，它是从无到有，从小到大苦干了五年。该校在1955年由原有的三个技工训练班合并而成的，而这些训练班大都是1952年三反、五反运动后，政府接管的一些小工厂的基础上开办的。这些小工厂厂房破旧狭窄，机器老而破烂。以后又从广西柳州按废铁买来了一批被国民党烧毁的兵工厂机器残骸。这样经老师和学生一面学习，一面修配起来的破旧机器，就是这些训练班当时的基本设备。那个时候，学生上课没有教室，没有桌椅，甚至没有一块像样的黑板。实习设备不足，就用昼夜四班轮流实习操作的办法解决。1955年在被火烧毁的麻袋加工厂的厂址上，改建了一部分教室、实习场，添置了一部分较为精密的机器。
    天津第一技工学校从训练班的时期起，就贯彻了以实习生产为主的教学方针，并且尽量争取以自制工具机器或加工零件来满足实习工具的需要。现在学校里使用的一部分皮带车床和虎钳、手锤、弯尺、划针盘等工具都是自己制造的。他们不但和本市一些大型工厂建立了协作关系，帮助这些协作厂制作较精密的机器部件，而且在生产技术水平逐步提高的基础上，于去年试制仿苏式C615车床成功，经检验符合国家规定标准。去年年底以前，他们已制造了十七台这样的车床。
    从1954年起到去年为止，该校已经为国家培养出来了一千四百多名技术工人，他们在各个生产岗位上发挥了他们所学到的技能。
