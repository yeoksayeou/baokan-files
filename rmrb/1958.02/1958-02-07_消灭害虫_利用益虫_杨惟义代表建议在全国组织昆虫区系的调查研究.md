Eliminate Pests, Utilize Beneficial Insects
Deputy Yang Weiyi Suggests Organizing a National Survey and Research of Insect Fauna

I fully agree with and warmly support the four reports made at this conference, and I am willing to do my best to implement the spirit of these reports.

Insect pests are often a major threat to agricultural production. Article 15 of the National Agricultural Development Program has already pointed out the need to prevent and eliminate plant diseases and insect pests, which is extremely important. Now I would like to express some opinions on the pest aspect, which may be helpful in realizing the National Agricultural Development Program.

Insects, though small, cannot be ignored. Their species are extremely numerous, more than other animals and all plants combined. Nearly one million species are known worldwide. China is a vast country with abundant resources, and there are naturally many kinds of insects. Nearly 30,000 species have already been identified. There are even more that are unknown. If a complete survey could be conducted, there might be no fewer than 100,000 species. It can be seen that this is not a simple issue, and there is a lot of work to be done in researching it. Among these many kinds of insects, some are very harmful to us, while others are quite beneficial. In short, the relationship between them and our interests is very close. We must launch an energetic struggle against nature, resolutely eliminating all pests and making full use of all kinds of beneficial insects. Is this possible? Before liberation, there was no need to talk about it; it was like a fool's dream. Now it is not difficult to achieve and can be gradually done. For example, rice borers and locusts have been considered two major disasters that could not be dealt with for thousands of years, haven't they? But since liberation, thanks to the strong prevention and control efforts of the party and government at all levels, leading the broad masses of farmers, they have basically been prevented from spreading and becoming disasters. This is a miracle. With scientific basis, people's confidence can be strengthened. Even right-wing elements cannot but bow their heads in the face of the facts. In the future, with the vigorous implementation of sanitation and fertilizer accumulation, and the elimination of the "Four Pests," it can be believed that in the near future, sanitary insect pests such as mosquitoes and flies in various places will gradually bid farewell to the people forever, so that the people can enjoy increasing health and happiness. However, we must not think that everything is fine and that nothing needs to be done. We must know that, in addition to rice borers, locusts, mosquitoes, and flies, there are various other extremely numerous pests that must continue to be eliminated. In addition to pests, there are many beneficial insects. For example, silkworms and bees are beneficial insects with great economic value. There are also many kinds of beneficial insects. Many beneficial insects that can be used are valuable resources, but they have not been well utilized, which is a pity. Therefore, I often feel that there is one thing that must be paid attention to and carried out now, that is, a national survey and research of insect fauna should be organized. Key areas should be selected by region to investigate in detail which pests and which beneficial insects are present in those areas. With this scientific survey data, we can correctly plan how to prevent and control pests and how to utilize beneficial insect resources. To conquer nature or utilize nature, we must first understand nature. This is a necessary step. Otherwise, lacking a scientific basis, and not knowing exactly what pests and beneficial insects are present, how can we do a good job in insect work? This matter should be the responsibility of the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and it should be carried out jointly with universities and related research institutions. It is not difficult to proceed.

Since China began its work on preventing and controlling rice borers, more than 40 years have passed. During such a long period, a comprehensive survey has not been conducted on how many kinds of pests and beneficial insects there are on rice crops. Without mastering this most basic situation, it is very inconvenient to promote prevention and control work. The same is true for the pests of other major crops such as cotton, wheat, soybeans, and hemp. A nationwide survey has not yet been conducted. This is a major shortcoming in research work. Therefore, I would like to suggest that the Institute of Plant Protection of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences must grasp this link and organize a group of entomologists to jointly carry out a "Survey of the Basic Situation of Pests of Major Crops in China," which is very necessary.

To do a good job in the research of insect fauna and the investigation of the basic situation of pests, it is necessary to be able to recognize insects first, otherwise there is no way to start. To be able to recognize insects, it is necessary to study some insect taxonomy and to cultivate some insect taxonomy talents. This should be carried out jointly by the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Plant Protection of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, which is more convenient.

China's agriculture is revving up its engine and leaping forward. In the future, with the development of production, the task of preventing and controlling various pests will become increasingly heavy. This is a very important link in production technology measures, and we must pay attention to the improvement and reform of technology to meet the needs of the development of the situation. The above-mentioned opinions seem to be able to help improve prevention and control work, so that it can better serve agricultural production. Are they appropriate? Please correct me.

### 消灭害虫　利用益虫  杨惟义代表建议在全国组织昆虫区系的调查研究

　　消灭害虫　利用益虫
    杨惟义代表建议在全国组织昆虫区系的调查研究
    我完全同意并热烈拥护这次大会中的四项报告，愿为贯彻这些报告中的精神而尽最大的努力。
    虫灾常为农业生产的重大威胁，农业发展纲要第十五条，已经指出，要防治和消灭病虫害，这是非常切要的。现在我想就害虫方面，发表一些意见，对于实现农业发展纲要，或许有些裨助。
    昆虫虽小，不可忽视，它的种类，极其繁多，比其他动物和所有植物的种数都更多。全世界上，所知道的，已近一百万种。我国地大物博，虫类自然不少，现在已经查出的，将达三万种。不知道的，更不知多少。如能完全查清，可能不会少于十万种。可见这不是一个简单的问题，研究起来，大有工作可做。这样许许多多的虫类，有的对于吾人很有危害，有的亦颇有益。总之，对于吾人的利害关系是非常密切的。我们必须展开与自然界斗争的干劲，对于一切害虫，都应当坚决地予以消灭；对于各种益虫，亦必须尽量予以利用。这是不是可以做得到呢？在解放以前，可不必谈，等于痴人说梦。现在不难实现，可以逐渐做到。譬如螟虫和蝗虫，数千年来，不是认为无法对付的两大灾害吗？但自解放以后，由于各级党、政领导广大农民群众，大力防治，基本上已经是做到不能蔓延成灾。这是一个奇迹，有了科学的依据，可以坚强人们的信心，就是右派分子，亦不能不在事实前面低头。以后厉行卫生积肥，消灭四害，可以相信，在不久的将来，各地的蚊、蝇等卫生虫害，当可逐渐与人们作永远的告别，可使人民大众，日增康乐。但是我们决不能因此而就认为大吉无事，更要知道，害虫方面，除了螟、蝗、蚊、蝇而外，还有各种各样极其众多的害虫，不能不继续予以消灭。除了害虫外，又有不少的益虫。如丝蚕和蜜蜂等，都是很有经济价值的益虫。益虫的种类，亦是很多的，有许多可以利用的益虫，都是宝贵的资源，现在都还没有很好的利用，实在可惜。因此，我常感觉到，现在有一件事必须注意进行，即是应在全国组织昆虫区系的调查研究，要分区选择重点，详查那区有那些害虫和那些益虫。有了这种科学性的调查资料，才可以正确地计划那里的害虫，应当如何防治；那些益虫资源，应当如何利用。要想征服自然或是利用自然，那就必须先要了解自然，这是必经的步骤。否则缺乏科学根据，究竟那里有什么害虫和益虫，都不大清楚，怎能搞好昆虫工作？此事应由中国科学院昆虫研究所负起责来，联系各高等学校和有关研究机构，共同来做，不难进行。
    我国自开始进行防治螟虫的工作以来，已经过了四十多年。在这样长期中，稻作上究竟有多少种害虫和益虫，都没有进行过全面的调查。这种最基本的情况，都没有掌握到，对于防治工作的推进，很多不便。其他如棉、麦、豆、麻等主要作物的害虫，也是一样，都还没有去作全国性的调查。这是研究工作中的一个大缺点。所以我想建议农业科学院的植保研究所，必须抓紧这个环节，应当组织一部分昆虫科学工作者，共同来进行“中国主要作物害虫基本情况的调查”，这是十分必要的。
    要想做好昆虫区系的研究和害虫基本情况的调查，那就必先要能认识昆虫，否则就无从着手。要想能认识昆虫，那就要学习一些昆虫的分类，要培养一些昆虫分类的人才。此事应由中国科学院昆虫研究所与农业科学院植保研究所，共同进行，更为方便。
    我国农业，正在开足马力，向前跃进。以后随着生产的发展，防治各种害虫的任务，将会愈来而愈重。这是生产技术措施中很重要的一个环节，我们必须配合形势发展的需要，注意技术的提高和改革。以上所提的各项意见，似乎可以帮助防治工作的改进，使能更好地为农业生产服务。是否有当？请予指正。
