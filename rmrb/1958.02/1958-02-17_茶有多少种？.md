Small Common Knowledge

    The tea we drink daily is made from the tender buds and leaves picked from tea trees after a series of processing procedures. Tea is one of the world's three major beverages (coffee, cocoa, tea).

    Tea contains ingredients such as caffeine, tannin, aromatic oil, vegetable protein, and vitamin C, which have the effects of refreshing the mind, promoting diuresis, and preventing diseases. It also has a pleasant aroma and taste. Therefore, for a long time, tea has become a popular beverage among the people, especially among ethnic minorities, where tea is a necessity of daily life. People say, "One can live without food for a day, but not without tea for a day." At the same time, tea is also one of China's export goods. Exporting one ton of black tea can exchange for ten tons of steel, and exporting one ton of green tea can exchange for twelve tons of steel.

    Currently, there are more than twenty tea-producing countries in the world. Among them, the largest producers are India, Ceylon, China, Japan, and Indonesia. India ranks first in terms of output, Ceylon ranks second, and China ranks third. China has a long history of tea production. As early as 2737 BC, the Chinese working people had already discovered tea trees, initially using them as medicine, and later gradually turning them into beverages. In 780 AD, the Chinese scholar Lu Yu collected folk experiences in tea planting and tea making and compiled the "Classic of Tea," which is the world's first specialized work on tea.

    The vast mountainous and hilly areas south of the Qinling Mountains and the Huai River in China have a mild and rainy climate, suitable for tea planting. Currently, there are tea-producing areas in more than six hundred counties in fifteen provinces across the country, with the main producing areas being Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Taiwan, and other provinces. In recent years, tea trees have also been experimentally planted in the high-altitude and cold regions of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Changdu region in western Sichuan.

    There are many types of tea in China. Fresh leaves picked from the same tea tree can be made into the following types of tea using different processing methods:

    Black Tea
    Fresh leaves are picked and processed through four stages: withering, rolling, fermentation, and drying. Because of the fermentation process, the finished tea is black. After brewing with boiling water, the tea liquor is red and bright, with an apple-like aroma. Black tea is mainly produced in Anhui, Fujian, Yunnan, Hunan, Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces. Market commodity names include more than ten varieties such as "Qihong," "Minhong," "Dianhong," "Yihong," "Hulong," "Chuanhong," and "Xiaozhong." Among them, "Qihong" and "Dianhong" are of the best quality and are very popular among foreign consumers. The black tea produced in China is mainly supplied for export.

    Green Tea
    Fresh leaves are picked, then subjected to high-temperature de-enzyming to stop the enzyme activity in the leaves, and then rolled and dried to make green tea. Because it does not go through the fermentation process, the finished product remains green. After brewing with boiling water, the tea liquor is slightly yellow-green and has a strong taste. China is the country with the largest production of green tea in the world, and its quality is good due to its superior natural conditions. Green tea producing areas are all over the southern provinces, among which the green tea produced in Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces is the most famous. Green tea is divided into "pan-fired green," "oven-dried green," and "sun-dried green" according to different drying methods. "Pan-fired green" is mainly supplied for export, and the commodity tea names include "Chun Mee," "Gunpowder," and "Zhucha." "Oven-dried green" and "sun-dried green" are mainly supplied for domestic sales or border sales. Famous commodity teas on the domestic market, such as "Longjing," "Guapian," "Maofeng," and "Biluochun," all belong to the "pan-fired green" or "oven-dried green" categories.

    Oolong Tea
    It is made using special manufacturing methods, so that the edges of the tea leaves are fermented and the middle is not fermented, so some people call it semi-fermented tea or "green leaves with red edges." It is mainly produced in Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan provinces. Commodity tea names include "Tieguanyin," "Oolong," "Qizhong," "Sezhong," and "Shuixian." The famous "Yancha" produced in Wuyi Mountain is a type of Oolong tea. Many people in Guangdong, Fujian, and Southeast Asian overseas Chinese love to drink this kind of tea.

    Scented Tea
    It uses the method of scenting to transfer the fragrance of fresh flowers such as jasmine, magnolia, pearl orchid, and bitter orange to the made green tea. Therefore, the scented tea after scenting has both tea fragrance and flower fragrance. What kind of flower is used to scent the tea, it is called what kind of flower tea on the market, such as "jasmine tea," "bitter orange tea," etc.

    Compressed Tea
    The made tea is reprocessed, steamed, and pressed into various shapes of block tea (brick-shaped, bowl-shaped, round cake-shaped, column-shaped, etc.). Its characteristic is that it is dark in color and strong in flavor. It is mainly sold in ethnic minority areas. Market commodity names include "Black Tea Brick," "Green Brick," "Rice Brick," "Huajuan," "Jintea," "Bingcha," "Jinjian," "Yaxi," and "Xibian Tea." The "Tuochas" on the domestic market are also in this category. Compressed tea is mainly produced in Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces.

    茶有多少种？
    我们日常饮用的茶叶，是从茶树上采下来的嫩芽嫩叶，经过一系列的加工过程制成的。茶叶是世界上三大饮料（咖啡、可可、茶叶）之一。
    茶叶内含有咖啡因、单宁、芳香油、植物性蛋白质和维生素丙等成份，有醒脑利尿和防病等作用，有令人喜爱的香气和滋味。因此长期以来，茶叶就成为广大人民所喜爱的饮料，特别是兄弟民族，茶叶是日常生活的必需品，人们“可以一日无食，不可一日无茶”。同时茶叶又是我国出口物资之一，出口一吨红茶可以换回十吨钢材，出口一吨绿茶、可以换回十二吨钢材。
    现在世界上产茶国家有二十多个。其中产量多的是印度、锡兰、中国、日本、印度尼西亚。按产量大小说，印度占第一位，锡兰占第二位，我国居第三位。我国产茶历史悠久，远在公元前2737年，我国劳动人民已经发现了茶树，起初当作药物，后来逐步成为饮料。公元780年，中国学者陆羽，搜集民间种茶、制茶经验，编著了“茶经”，这是世界上第一部茶叶专门著作。
    我国秦岭、淮河以南的广大山区和丘陵地带，气候温和多雨，适于植茶。现在全国茶区共十五个省六百多县，其中主要产区为浙江、安徽、福建、湖南、湖北、四川、云南、台湾等省。近几年来，四川西部阿坝藏族自治州和昌都地区等高寒地带，也在试种茶树。
    我国茶叶种类很多，同是茶树采下来的鲜叶，用不同的加工处理方法，可制成下面几种茶叶：
    红茶
    将采下的鲜叶，经过萎雕、揉捻、醱酵、干燥等四个过程制成的。因为经过醱酵过程，所以成品茶呈黑色。沸水冲泡后，汤色红艳，有苹果香气。红茶主要产在皖、闽、滇、湘、川、鄂、赣等省。市场上商品名称有“祁红”、“闽红”、“滇红”、“宜红”、“湖红”、“川红”、“小种”等十余种，其中“祁红”、“滇红”品质最佳，极受国外消费者欢迎，我国所产红茶主要供应出口。
    绿茶
    采下鲜叶，经过高温杀青，停止叶内酵素活动，然后再经过揉捻，干燥制成绿茶。因为不经过醱酵过程，所以成品保持青绿色。用沸水冲泡后，汤色微黄带绿，味浓厚。我国是世界上产绿茶最多的国家，而且由于自然条件优越，品质良好。绿茶产区遍及南方各省，其中安徽、浙江、江西等省产的绿茶最为著名。绿茶按干燥方法的不同，又分为“炒青”、“烘青”、“晒青”三种。“炒青”主要供应出口，商品茶名称有“珍眉”、“贡熙”、“珠茶”等。“烘青”、“晒青”主要供应内销或边销。国内市场上著名的商品茶如“龙井”、“瓜片”、“毛峰”、“碧螺春”等，都属于“炒青”或“烘青”一类。
    乌龙茶
    是采用特殊的制造方法，使茶叶边缘醱酵中间不醱酵，所以有人称为半醱酵茶或“绿叶红镶边”。主要产在福建、广东、台湾三省。商品茶名称有“铁观音”、“乌龙”、“奇种”、“色种”、“水仙”等。著名的武夷山所产“岩茶”，就是乌龙茶一类。广东、福建和东南亚侨胞中，很多人爱饮这种茶。
    花茶
    是采用窨制的办法，将茉莉、玉兰、珠兰、玳玳等鲜花的香气，转移到制成的绿茶上面。所以窨制后的花茶，既有茶香，又有花香。用什么花窨制的茶叶，在市场上就叫什么花茶，如“茉莉花茶”、“玳玳花茶”等。
    紧压茶
    将制成的茶叶，经过再加工蒸馏压制，成为各种不同形状的块状茶（有砖形，碗形，圆饼形，柱形等），它的特点是色深味浓。主要销在兄弟民族地区。市场商品名称有“黑茶砖”、“青砖”、“米砖”、“花卷”、“紧茶”、“饼茶”、“金尖”、“芽细”、“西边茶”等。内销市场上的“沱茶”也是这一类。紧压茶主要产地为湖南、湖北、四川、云南、贵州等省。
