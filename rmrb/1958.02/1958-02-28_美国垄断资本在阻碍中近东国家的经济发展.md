U.S. Monopoly Capital is Hindering the Economic Development of Countries in the Middle East and Near East
Soviet Union K. Bukints

Editor's Note: The ruling groups in the United States, from Eisenhower, Nixon, Dulles to Truman, and Stevenson, have been loudly promoting the U.S. "Mutual Security Program" these days, demanding that the American people accept this program. According to them, the aid the United States provides to various countries is "in the hope that these countries will become independent and stand as proud and strong friends and partners with whom we can live together in mutual respect." The following article, selected from the Soviet "Pravda," thoroughly exposes and analyzes the essence of the U.S.'s so-called "aid." After reading it, everyone will understand what the U.S.'s so-called intention to make these recipient countries "independent" really means.

One of the urgent tasks being solved by the young, independent nations of Asia and Africa is to overcome the economic backwardness left over from the colonial slavery system. The industrialization policies announced by many Asian and African countries are of great significance for achieving economic independence.

It is worth mentioning that state-owned economic components have been established in the national economies of some Eastern countries, especially in heavy industry. This has opened up new possibilities for increasing the speed of economic development, accelerating industrialization, and crowding out foreign capital.

Whom does the industrialization of Asian and African countries harm?

American imperialism has been trying every possible means to resist the industrialization and the establishment of state-owned enterprises by young countries striving for economic independence. In the summer of 1955, the Hoover Commission specifically suggested that the United States oppose the industrialization of Asian countries, emphasizing the hope of avoiding "future competition" as an argument. Another very telling example is that last year, the World Bank, controlled by the United States, refused to provide loans to India, arguing that India's plan to develop heavy industry exceeded its actual capacity.

The establishment of state-owned economic components in some Eastern countries has also caused great dissatisfaction among American monopoly capitalists. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Dillon stated: "We believe that the economic development of these countries is best achieved with the help of domestic or foreign private capital." Dillon's mention of "domestic private capital" was merely a polite gesture. He then used some words to explain that, due to the insufficient amount of such capital, its task would be undertaken by American capital...

Not long ago, the U.S. International Cooperation Administration (the U.S. foreign aid management agency) issued a special statement saying that, in accordance with the U.S.'s consistent policy of sponsoring private enterprise, the United States will not provide funds to state-owned manufacturing and mining industries. Even the consistently obedient American press believes that this statement is a crude intervention in many Asian and African countries, such as India.

What exactly is causing panic among the Wall Street financial oligarchs can be seen in a statement by Prioleau, the manager of "Mobil Oil Company." Prioleau warned that if the current trend of "establishing state control over industry" is not changed, "American investment will be squeezed out of these potentially rich markets." Rostow and Hatchin, the authors of "American Policy in Asia," pointed out another reason for the anxiety of American monopoly capitalists. What they are most concerned about is that independent economic development will create a political situation in Asian and African countries that renders all the conspiracies of colonialists useless.

The Hypocritical Theory of "Interdependence"

Now, the spokespersons of monopoly capital are forced to face up to the desire of the people of Eastern countries for economic progress, and they have adopted a disguised approach. They put forward the deceptive idea of ​​so-called "interdependence" between imperialist countries and Eastern countries. "Interdependence" is endlessly touted in the turbid flow of American colonialist propaganda. The Eisenhower Doctrine also flaunts the "interconnectedness" of the Middle East and Near East countries and Western countries.

Reactionary thinkers portray "interdependence" as a "necessary" condition for the smooth economic development of Eastern countries. At the same time, they use various methods to argue that young Eastern countries are incapable of developing their economies independently. They also "prove" that the current state of backwardness in these countries is an "insurmountable" obstacle to achieving economic independence. Imperialist propaganda attempts to portray U.S. "aid" and foreign investment as the "only" means for Eastern countries to achieve economic progress.

However, the defenders of the colonial system remain silent about the fact that the backwardness of Eastern countries today is precisely because of hundreds of years of "interdependence" with Western imperialism. According to British economist Clark, on the eve of driving out the British colonialists, India's economic development was more backward than the level of the United States in 1830, only two-fifths of the latter's level, and 70% lower than Germany in the 1850s.

In order to find a basis for the hypocritical theory of "interdependence," bourgeois "scholars" attempt to use the logic of social development as an excuse, a logic of development that places any modern country in complex interrelationships with other countries. Under this "argument," fighters for national independence are slandered as "narrow-minded," "backward," and having the "reactionary" intention of destroying the historically formed connections between peoples of various countries. However, the mouthpieces of U.S. imperialism waste their efforts by keeping silent about the fact that the objective trend of deepening and complexifying connections between countries around the world can be expressed either as the kind of forced relationship inherent in imperialism or as voluntarily formed relationships. The Eastern countries precisely want to eradicate the imperialist-style connections that are forcibly formed. Without doing so, the people of all countries will not be able to achieve true harmony.

When imperialist thinkers are touting "interdependence," they are by no means thinking of supporting the economic and other connections between countries that are essential for modern social development. Forcing Eastern countries to accept the U.S.'s "interdependence" is an attempt by U.S. monopoly capital to adapt to the changed environment and salvage the foundation of the colonial exploitation system. And this foundation is the unequal relationship between imperialist countries and Asian and African countries.

"Aid" or Slavery?

The so-called "aid" is just a practical tool for the United States to implement its plan to economically, and ultimately politically, enslave Asian and African countries. It is now clear to everyone that what is hidden behind this pleasant name is mainly military appropriations. From April 1948 to December 1956, more than 80% of the funds spent by the U.S. International Cooperation Administration in Asian and African countries were used for military purposes.

The United States uses loans and grants to drag some Eastern countries into military blocs and force them to expand their armaments and prepare for war. It is very obvious that after Iran and Pakistan joined the Baghdad Pact, the United States greatly increased its military "aid" to them.

It goes without saying that U.S. "aid" is far from enough to compensate for the massive military expenditures. Military expenditures are the inevitable consequence of joining aggressive alliances. For example, Thailand's military spending is seven times the amount of aid it receives from the United States. Huge military budgets lead to economic disintegration, increased taxes, increased poverty, and depletion of resources that are extremely necessary for improving the economies of Eastern countries. These consequences are exactly what U.S. monopoly capital is hoping for.

Only 10% to 20% of U.S. "aid" is so-called economic development appropriations, and mainly used for "non-military" projects such as the construction of ports, strategic highways, and communication tools.

At the same time, the expenditures for purchasing means of production, which are particularly important for the economic development of Eastern countries, are negligible in the "aid" plan.

Not only that, but the executive agencies of U.S. "aid" also use various methods to hinder the implementation of measures that would promote the economic independence of Eastern countries.

Loans and grants in "economic development," just like military "aid," are also attached with unequal, and sometimes even openly insulting, conditions that force the recipient countries to accept. The Wall Street financial oligarchs demand the implementation of policies that are beneficial to them in exchange for their gold gifts, demand the provision of military bases for the United States, demand control of raw material production areas, and demand the cessation of cooperation with socialist countries, which is very beneficial to Eastern countries and particularly important for them to achieve economic independence. In addition, the Wall Street giants also demand that recipient countries abandon the development of state-owned economic components in the national economy and give special privileges to American capital.

Of course, under these conditions, most of the American aid appropriations are accepted by the governments of those countries that are known for their dependence on the United States and follow its aggressive policies.

At the same time, the United States and its World Bank refuse to aid those countries that do not accept unequal conditions and embark on the road of independence. After Egypt refused to make political and economic concessions, the U.S. government, together with the British government, cancelled the loans it promised to provide to Egypt for the construction of the Aswan Dam. Since the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, especially after the failure of the British, French, and Israeli aggression, the United States has been waging an economic war against Egypt. Israel has therefore received a large amount of U.S. subsidies.

It must be pointed out that "aid" is a highly profitable deal for U.S. monopoly capital. Everyone knows that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" promised to give Arab countries 200 million U.S. dollars in 1958 and 1959. But the Aramco oil company in the Arab Gulf region alone obtained a profit of 581.12 million U.S. dollars in 1955.

The example of Turkey clearly illustrates what consequences "aid" can bring to a country and what the purpose of "aid" is. Turkey has been under the special "patronage" of American imperialism for ten years. The American magazine "Fortune" even called it a "test field" for U.S. "aid." From 1947 to 1956, Turkey's military expenditures exceeded one and a half times the total amount of aid it received from the United States.

Turkey's national economy has been devastated under the heavy burden of militarization. The British "Daily Mirror" wrote when commenting on the situation in this country: "Turkey is close to bankruptcy because it supports a huge army of 500,000 infantry." What U.S. "aid" has "cultivated" in its "test field" is: subordination to the United States, militarization of the country, inflation, increased taxes, and impoverished people.

It is not surprising that there are now calls everywhere protesting against these kinds of American "good deeds."

This is the fact. These facts reveal the essence of U.S. "aid" as a tool of the colonial policy of American monopoly capital. Its purpose is to undermine the foundations of the independent development of Asian and African countries.

Life has exposed the lies fabricated by the defenders of the colonial system about the inability of the people of Eastern countries to develop their own economies. Political independence, the unleashing of the initiative of the masses, measures to oppose feudal forms of exploitation, the establishment of state-owned enterprises (especially in heavy industry), and trade and cooperation with socialist countries—all of these have created new and favorable conditions for former colonial countries to strive for economic independence. Those countries that are strengthening their sovereignty and implementing independent and autonomous policies are developing their remarkable achievements in industry and agriculture.

It is futile for U.S. imperialism to attempt to prevent the independent development of Eastern countries. The people of all countries who are rising up to fight for national independence and freedom will remove the colonialists from their path forward.

    美国垄断资本在阻碍中近东国家的经济发展
    苏联　克·布鲁金茨
    编者按：美国的统治集团，从艾森豪威尔、尼克松、杜勒斯到杜鲁门、史蒂文森，这几天来都在大吹大擂地宣传美国的“共同安全计划”，要求美国人民接受这个计划。据他们的说法，美国提供各国的援助是“希望这些国家自立起来，作为我们可以在相互尊重中共同生活的自豪和强壮的朋友和伙伴”。这里选载的苏联“真理报”上的一篇文章，详细揭露和分析了美国所谓“援助”的实质，读了以后，谁也会明白美国所谓使这些受援国家“自立”起来的含意是什么。
    年轻的亚非民族独立国家正在解决的一项迫切任务，就是要克服殖民奴役制度所遗留下来的经济落后状态。许多亚非国家所宣布的工业化政策，对于取得经济独立有着巨大的意义。
    值得提及的是，在一些东方国家的国民经济中，特别是重工业方面建立了国营经济成分。这就为提高经济发展速度、加速工业化、排挤外国资本开辟了新的可能。
    亚非国家的工业化对谁不利
    美帝国主义千方百计地来抵制年轻的国家，为取得经济独立而采取的工业化和建立国营企业的措施。1955年夏天，胡佛委员会曾特别建议要美国反对亚洲国家的工业化，并着重以希望避免“未来的竞争”作为论据。还有很能说明问题的例子就是，去年在美国控制下的世界银行曾拒绝向印度提供贷款，它的理由是印度发展重工业的计划已超过它的实际能力。
    某些东方国家建立起国营经济成分这件事，也引起了美国垄断资本老大的不满。美国负责经济事务的助理国务卿狄龙曾表示：“我们认为这些国家的经济发展最好是求助于本国或外国的私人资本。”狄龙所以提到“本国私人资本”的字样不过是一种礼貌的表示，接着他就用一些话来说明，由于这类资本数量不足，所以它的任务将由美国资本……来承担。
    不久以前，美国的国际合作署（美国的援外管理机关——译者）曾发表一项特别的声明说，根据美国一向赞助私人经营的方针，美国将不对国营的制造工业和采矿工业提供资金。甚至一贯百依百顺的美国报刊，也认为这个声明是对许多亚非国家例如印度的粗暴干涉。
    到底是什么促使华尔街金融寡头们惶惶不安，从“美孚油公司”经理普赖奥洛的一项声明中便可以见出分晓。普赖奥洛警告说，如果目前这种“建立国家对工业的控制”的趋势不改变，“美国的投资就会从这些富有潜力的市场中被排挤出去。”而“美国对亚洲的政策”一书的作者罗斯托和汉琴，指出了美国垄断资本家惶惶不安的另一个原因。原来他们最感到不安的是独立的经济发展会在亚非国家内造成一种使殖民主义者一切阴谋无计可施的政治形势。
    虚伪的“互相依赖”论
    现在，垄断资本的代言人迫于无奈，不得不正视东方各国人民追求经济进步的愿望，于是便采取一种伪装的手法。他们提出了一个帝国主义国家和东方国家之间所谓的“互相依赖”的骗人的思想。在美国的殖民主义宣传的浊流中叨叨不休地鼓吹“互相依赖”。艾森豪威尔主义也在标榜着中近东国家和西方国家的“相互联系”。
    反动的思想家们把“互相依赖”描绘成东方国家顺利发展经济的“必要”条件。同时他们又用各种方法来论证年轻的东方国家在独立发展经济方面无能为力。他们又“证明”说，目前这些国家的落后状态是取得经济独立的“不可克服”的障碍。帝国主义的宣传企图把美“援”和外国的投资描写成东方国家取得经济进步的“唯一”手段。
    但是，殖民制度的辩护人却缄口不谈东方国家正是因为同西方帝国主义“互相依赖”了好几百年才造成今天的落后。根据英国经济学家克拉克的统计，印度在赶走英国殖民者的前夕，它的经济发展比1830年美国的水平还落后，只及后者的五分之二，十九世纪五十年代的德国的水平还比它超过70％。
    资产阶级“学者”为了替虚伪的“互相依赖”论找根据，企图以社会发展的逻辑为借口，这种发展的逻辑使任何一个现代国家同其它国家处在千丝万缕的复杂的相互关系中。在这种“论据”下面，争取民族独立的战士们被诬为“眼光狭窄”、“落后”，具有破坏各国人民之间历史上形成的联系的“反动”意图。但是，美帝国主义的传声筒却枉费心机地闭口不谈，世界各国之间联系的加深和复杂化的客观趋势既可表现为帝国主义所固有的那种强迫的关系，也可以表现为自愿结成的关系。东方国家恰恰是要铲除强迫结成的帝国主义式的联系。不这样做，各国人民便无法实现真正的和睦关系。
    帝国主义的思想家在鼓吹“互相依赖”的时候，绝不是在想支持现代社会发展中所十分必要的各国之间的经济以及其它联系。强使东方国家接受美国的“相互依赖”，这乃是美国垄断资本企图顺应已改变的环境，挽救殖民剥削制度的基础。而这个基础就是帝国主义国家同亚非国家双方的不平等关系。
    “援助”还是奴役？
    所谓“援助”不过是美国实现在经济上，而归根到底是在政治上奴役亚非国家计划的一个实际的工具。现在大家都很清楚，在这个动听的名称后面隐藏着的主要是军事拨款。从1948年4月到1956年12月，美国国际合作署在亚非国家所支出的款项，80％以上都用在军事上面了。
    美国使用贷款和补助来把一些东方国家拉入军事集团，并强使它们扩军备战。非常明显的是，在伊朗和巴基斯坦加入巴格达条约之后，美国就大大增加了对它们的军事“援助”。
    不言而喻，美“援”远不足以弥补大量的军备开支。军备开支是加入侵略同盟的不可避免的后果。例如，泰国用于军队的开支七倍于它从美国所得到的援款。庞大的军事预算导致经济解体、赋税增加、贫困加剧，以及耗尽为提高东方国家经济所极端必要的资源。这种后果正是美国垄断资本所指望的。
    美“援”只有10％到20％是所谓经济发展的拨款，而且主要又是用于修建港口、战略性公路、通讯工具等这一类的“非军事”工程。
    同时，在“援助”计划中对于东方国家发展经济特别重要的，例如购买生产资料的开支，却微不足道。
    不仅如此，美“援”的执行机关还以各种方法来阻碍实现那些会促进东方国家经济独立的措施。
    “经济发展”方面的贷款和补助也正像军事“援助”一样，附有强使受援国接受的不平等的、有时甚至是公开侮辱性的条件。华尔街的金融寡头们以他们的金元礼物作为交换品要求执行对于他们有利的政策，要求为美国提供军事基地，要求控制原料产地，要求停止同社会主义国家合作，而这种合作对于东方国家说来是十分有利的，对于它们取得经济独立更是异常重要的。此外，华尔街巨头们还要求受援国家在国民经济中放弃国营经济成分的发展，并给美国资本以特权。
    当然，在这种条件下接受大部分美国援助拨款的都是那些以依赖美国著称，并追随它的侵略政策的国家的政府。
    同时，美国和它的世界银行却拒绝援助那些不接受不平等条件、走上独立道路的国家。在埃及拒绝作政治和经济的让步之后，美国政府曾和英国政府一道撤消了答应给埃及供修建阿斯旺水坝的贷款。从苏伊士运河公司国有化之日起，特别是在英、法、以侵略失败之后，美国曾对埃及进行了经济战。以色列曾因此接受到大量的美国补助。
    必须指出，“援助”对于美国垄断资本说来是利市百倍的买卖。大家知道，“艾森豪威尔主义”曾答应在1958年和1959年给阿拉伯国家两亿美元。但仅是在阿拉伯湾地区的阿美石油公司在1955年就曾获得了五亿八千一百二十万美元的利润。
    土耳其的例子清楚地说明“援助”会给一个国家带来什么后果，“援助”的目的何在。土耳其受美帝国主义特别的“庇护”已经有十年了。美国“幸福”杂志甚至称它为美“援”的“试验田”。从1947年到1956年土耳其的军费开支超过了它从美“援”获得的总款额的一倍半以上。
    土耳其的国民经济在军事化的重担下已经一蹶不振。英国的“每日镜报”在评论这个国家的局势时写道：“士耳其已接近破产，因为它供养着一支五十万步兵的庞大军队”。美“援”在它的“试验田”中所“培植”的就是：对美国的从属、国家的军事化、通货膨胀、赋税加重、民不聊生。
    目前到处都掀起了抗议美国这类“善行”的呼声，这是不足为奇的。
    事实就是这样。这些事实揭示了作为美国垄断资本殖民政策的工具的美“援”的实质。它的目的就是要破坏亚非国家独立发展的根基。
    生活揭穿了殖民制度辩护者捏造的关于东方各国人民不能发展自己经济的谎言。政治上的独立、人民群众积极性的发挥、反对封建剥削形式的措施，国营企业（特别是在重工业中）的建立、同社会主义国家的贸易和合作，所有这些都为前殖民地国家开创了争取经济独立的新的有利条件。那些加强自己的主权、实行独立自主政策的国家正在发展自己在工农业方面所取得的显著成就。
    美帝国主义企图阻止东方国家的独立发展是徒劳无益的。奋起为民族独立和自由而斗争的各国人民将把殖民者从他们前进的道路上铲除掉。
