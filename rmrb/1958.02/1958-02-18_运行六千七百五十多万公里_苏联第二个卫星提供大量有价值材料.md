    Having Traveled Over Sixty-Seven Million Five Hundred and Fifty Thousand Kilometers
    The Soviet Union's Second Satellite Provides a Large Amount of Valuable Material
    Xinhua News Agency, February 16th: TASS reports: As of 9:00 AM Moscow time on February 16th, the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite has orbited the Earth one thousand five hundred times.
    One hundred and five days have passed since the second artificial satellite was launched. The distance the satellite has traveled has reached sixty-seven million five hundred and fifty-five thousand kilometers, equivalent to eighty-seven and a half round trips from the Earth to the Moon, or one point one eight times the closest distance between Mars and the Earth.
    Since the second artificial satellite entered orbit, scientists have accumulated a large amount of radio and optical observation material of great value, and are continuing to accumulate this material daily. From the measured values, the calculated orbital parameters of the artificial satellite match the actual situation. This proves the high degree of accuracy in the calculation and prediction of satellite operation during the design of the artificial satellite. Currently, the orbital period of this satellite is ninety-seven and a half minutes, which is six point two minutes less than its initial orbital period, and one point three minutes more than the initial orbital period of the first artificial satellite.
    The initial orbital period of the second artificial satellite decreased by two seconds per day, and now decreases by nearly four point seven seconds per day. Currently, the highest point of the satellite's orbit is one thousand and eighty kilometers from the ground, which is five hundred and ninety kilometers lower than at the beginning of its operation.

    运行六千七百五十多万公里
    苏联第二个卫星提供大量有价值材料
    据新华社16日讯  据塔斯社讯：截至16日莫斯科时间九点正为止，苏联第二个人造卫星已经绕地球转了一千五百圈。
    从发射第二个人造卫星到现在，已经过了一百零五个昼夜，这个人造卫星经过的路程已经达六千七百五十五万五千公里，相当于从地球到月亮八十七个半来回，等于火星距地球最近时的距离的一点一八倍。
    从第二个人造卫星进入轨道以来，科学家们已经积累了大量有重大价值的无线电观测和光学观测的材料，现在每天还继续在积累着这方面的材料。从已经测量到的数值看来，人造卫星轨道参数的推算和实际情况是相吻合的。这证明在设计人造卫星时对卫星运行的推算和预测有高度准确性。现在这个人造卫星的运行周期是九十七分半钟，比它初进入轨道时的运行周期减少了六点二分钟，比第一个人造卫星初进入轨道时多一点三分钟。
    第二个人造卫星初进入轨道时的运行周期每昼夜减少二秒钟，现在每昼夜减少将近四点七秒钟。目前，这个卫星的轨道的最高点离地面是一千零八十公里，比它运转初期减低了五百九十公里。
