Xinhua News Agency, 1st - Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhu Jigong reports: How to make unified arrangements and mutual coordination in laboratory equipment? This is a problem that the universities and colleges in the capital have raised in this anti-waste campaign that must be thoroughly resolved.

The state funds spent on laboratory equipment in universities and colleges are enormous. Tsinghua University spends about one-third of its total school funds on this each year. Compared with the period before liberation, the expenses of this school under the item of laboratory equipment are 25% more than the average annual funds allocated by the reactionary Nationalist government's puppet Ministry of Education to all universities and colleges in the country from 1937 to 1945. The five engineering colleges newly built in the northwestern suburbs of Beijing—Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Beijing Mining Institute, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration, and Beijing Petroleum Institute—have each built an average of more than 40 laboratories and practice factories over the past few years, with the state spending a total of about 33.5 million yuan on this. In order to change China's backwardness in culture and science and improve the quality of teaching in universities and colleges, it is necessary to build some laboratories, practice factories, and purchase some necessary equipment. The question is whether it is necessary for each school to equip itself with a complete set in the same city or in areas close to the school site. By making unified arrangements and mutual coordination, can some laboratories and practice factories with very low utilization rates and great waste be reduced, stopped, or merged, and this part of the funds be used in areas most needed by the country?

The basis for people to raise this question is that in many universities and colleges in Beijing, there are identical laboratories, practice factories, or identical instruments and equipment with low utilization rates, not only between schools but also between departments and teaching and research sections within a school. The above-mentioned five engineering colleges each have a practice factory with complete and largely identical equipment, but the time they are used is very short. The mechanical practice factory of Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration has 15 lathes, milling machines, planers, and other machine tools, worth more than 94,000 yuan, but they are only used by more than 120 students in the exploration engineering specialty. In the future, the practice time will be concentrated in more than 40 days during the summer vacation, and the rest of the time is only used to do some odd jobs for laboratories and other units. The Beijing Mining Institute, located across from this college, also has a mechanical practice factory with more than 60 lathes of various types, worth more than 1.1 million yuan, but students only practice here for about one month each semester. The situation in the other four colleges with practice factories is roughly the same. If these colleges can work together, they can completely reduce the construction of some of these practice factories. For example, the Department of Geophysical Prospecting of Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration purchased a seismic station worth more than 300,000 yuan from abroad, and the Department of Geophysics of Beijing Petroleum Institute, which is adjacent to this college, also prepared such a seismic station, but both are only used for two or three months of the year. Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration purchased 13 drilling rigs with very low efficiency. Among them, a 1,200-meter deep well drilling rig was sealed and stockpiled in the warehouse, while Beijing Petroleum Institute spent 580,000 yuan to buy a better 1,500-meter deep well drilling rig. Other examples, such as Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology and Beijing Mining Institute repeatedly purchasing expensive equipment such as belt conveyors and open-pit coal loaders, exist in many universities and colleges in the capital.

Close proximity, duplicate equipment, and short usage time indicate that many universities and colleges in Beijing have the conditions for mutual cooperation in laboratory equipment. In the 1956-1957 academic year, when the Department of Mining Engineering of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology had not yet established a laboratory, teachers led students to the nearby Beijing Mining Institute to use the school's mining machinery and equipment laboratory for experiments on ventilator performance, pump performance, hoist operation, and structure. The director of the Department of Mining Engineering and the director of the Teaching and Research Section of Mining Machinery and Equipment of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, who were in charge of guiding these experiments, introduced to the reporter the cooperation between the two schools at that time. They first solved the problem of scheduling. Before the start of each semester, they negotiated with the Beijing Mining Institute and proposed a more suitable time. If the other party could not meet this requirement, they would adjust it themselves. Secondly, although the two schools were neighbors, it took more than an hour to travel back and forth. In order not to burden the students too much, they appropriately reduced the requirements for the experimental report, but it did not have much impact on the quality of the experiment. Based on this past experience, he believed that mutual cooperation was entirely feasible. However, if the working systems of the two schools are inconsistent, and the borrowing system and procedures for borrowing equipment are too strict and too numerous, it will cause certain difficulties for mutual cooperation if there is no unified arrangement. The director of this teaching and research section also said that large machinery needed for mining machinery experimental courses, such as coal cutting machines, combines, and tunneling machines, are already available at Beijing Mining Institute, so Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology does not need to buy them again. Some specialized students at Beijing Mining Institute need to have knowledge of hydrogeology, while Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration has a Department of Hydrogeology, with excellent teachers and teaching equipment. Beijing Mining Institute borrowed the laboratory of Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration and entrusted the Department of Hydrogeology of this college to train teachers, and successfully completed the teaching task.

Principles of mechanics and parts are a basic course commonly offered by engineering universities and colleges. In 1956, the relevant teaching and research groups of Tsinghua University, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Beijing Petroleum Institute, and Beijing Mining Institute held a joint meeting to determine specific methods from designing and making models separately to unified use, thus overcoming the difficulties of insufficient manpower and material resources in each school.

After this rectification movement, the leadership of some schools also began to realize the problems in this area. Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration and Beijing Mining Institute are considering jointly using a mechanical practice factory, freeing up surplus machine tools to support production and construction. The metallurgical practice factory of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology has been jointly used with Beijing Heating Material Factory, allowing the factory to smelt tool steel in the practice factory. The leadership of Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration stated that they now have more than 5,000 compasses worth 60 to 100 yuan each, which can be supplied to other units for more than half a year each year.

From the above situation, it can be seen that the potential existing in the instruments and equipment of laboratories in many universities and colleges in the capital is enormous, the possibility of saving national financial expenditures is also very large, there are precedents for how to cooperate with each other, and many universities and colleges also have the desire to cooperate after the rectification. The problem now is that there is still a lack of unified planning for this important aspect of universities and colleges opposing waste and running schools diligently and frugally.

　　反掉一切铺张浪费　勤俭办好文教事业
    首都高等学校反浪费中提出新课题
    实验室仪器设备需要统筹协作
    新华社1日讯　新华社记者朱继功报道：如何在实验室仪器设备方面统筹安排和互相协作？这是首都高等学校在这次反浪费中提出必须彻底解决的问题。
    高等学校在实验室仪器设备方面所耗费的国家资金是巨大的，清华大学每年用于这方面的经费，约占全校经费总额的三分之一。如果同解放前相比，这个学校在实验室仪器设备项目下所支出的费用，比国民党反动政府伪教育部在1937年到1945年时期平均每年拨给全国所有高等学校的经费还要多出25％。新建在北京西北郊的北京钢铁工业学院、北京矿业学院、北京航空学院、北京地质勘探学院和北京石油学院等五所工科学院，几年来每个学校平均兴建了四十个以上的实验室和实习工厂，国家花在这方面的钱共约三千三百五十万元。为了改变我国在文化科学上的落后面貌，提高高等学校教学质量，兴建一些实验室、实习工厂和购置一些必要的设备是必要的。问题在于同一城市或校址相近的地区内，是否可以不必各自配备一套，通过统筹安排和互相协作，少建、停建和合并一些使用率很小而浪费很大的实验室和实习工厂，把这部分资金腾出来用到国家最需要的方面去。
    人们提出这个问题的根据是：在北京许多高等学校中，有相同的实验室、实习工厂或相同的仪器设备而使用率又低的情况，不仅存在于学校和学校之间，而且存在于一个学校系和系、教研室和教研室之间。上述五个工科学院就各有一个实习工厂，设备都很齐全，并且大体相同，但是使用它的时间都很少。北京地质勘探学院的机械实习工厂，有车、铣、刨等各种车床十五台，价值九万四千多元，而使用它们的仅是探工专业的一百二十多个学生，今后实习时间又集中在暑期四十多天中进行，其余的时间只为实验室等单位做一些零活。设在这个学院对面的北京矿业学院，也有一个机械实习工厂，它拥有各种车床六十多台，价值一百一十多万元，学生每学期在这里仅实习一个月左右。其他四个有实习工厂的学院的情况也大体是这样。这些学院如能通力协作，是完全可以少建一些这类实习工厂的。例如北京地质勘探学院的物理探矿系从国外购置了一个价值三十多万元的地震站，和这个学院相邻的北京石油学院的地球物理专业跟着也置备了一个这样的地震站，但是一年中都只使用两、三个月。北京地质勘探学院购置了十三台钻机，使用效率很低，其中还有一架一千二百公尺深井钻机原封不动地被积压在仓库里，而北京石油学院却花了五十八万元买了一台更好的一千五百公尺深井钻机。其他如北京钢铁工业学院和北京矿业学院重复购置价值较高的皮带运输机、露天装煤机等设备的事例，在首都许多高等学校中都存在。
    地址相近、设备重复、使用时间都很短暂，说明北京许多高等学校在实验室的仪器设备上是有条件互相协作的。1956至1957学年，北京钢铁工业学院采矿系还没有建立实验室时，他们就由教师率领学生到附近的北京矿业学院去，利用这个学校的矿山机械设备实验室作通风机性能、水泵性能、提升机操作和构造等实验。负责指导这些实验的北京钢铁工业学院采矿系主任和矿山机械设备教研室主任在谈到这个问题时，向记者介绍了当时两校进行协作的情形。他们首先解决了排课问题，每逢学期开始以前，他们就同北京矿业学院进行协商，提出比较合适的时间，如果对方不能满足这个要求，就再自行调整。其次，两校虽然是比邻而居，但往返也得花一个多小时，为了不致使学生负担过重，他们就从实验报告这一环节上适当地降低要求，但对实验质量并没有多大影响。根据过去这段经验，他认为互相协作是完全可行的。但是，如果两个学校作息制度不一致，借用仪器设备的制度和手续过严、过多等等，如不统筹安排，就会给相互协作造成一定困难。这个教研室的主任还说，像采矿机械实验课所需的大型机械——截煤机、康拜因、钻巷机等，现在北京矿业学院都已经有了，北京钢铁工业学院就可以不必再买。北京矿业学院有些专业学生需要具备水文地质的知识，而北京地质勘探学院就专门设有水文地质系，从师资到教学设备条件都很好。北京矿业学院就借用北京地质学院的实验室，并且委托这个学院的水文地质系培养师资，结果顺利地完成了教学任务。
    机械原理及零件是工科高等学校共同开设的一门基础课。1956年，清华大学、北京钢铁工业学院、北京石油学院和北京矿业学院的有关教研组召开了联席会议，确定了从分头设计、制作模型到统一使用的具体办法，因此克服了各校人力、物力不足的困难。
    经过这次整风运动，有些学校的领导方面也开始认识到这方面存在的问题。北京地质勘探学院和北京矿业学院正在考虑共同使用一个机械实习工厂，腾出多余的机床支援生产建设。北京钢铁工业学院的冶金实习工厂，已和北京市暖气材料厂合用，让这个工厂在实习工厂内炼制工具用钢。北京地质勘探学院领导方面表示，他们现在有价值六十到一百元的罗盘五千多个，每年有半年多时间可以供给其他单位使用。
    从以上情况中可以看出：在首都许多高等学校实验室的仪器、设备上存在的潜力是巨大的，节约国家财政开支的可能性也是很大的，如何互相协作也有了先例，许多高等学校经过整风后也有了协作的愿望。现在的问题是：对于这个有关高等学校反对浪费、勤俭办校的重要方面，还缺乏统筹安排。
