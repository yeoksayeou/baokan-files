    Remembering Comrade Yang Jingyu
    Jiang Chunfang
    I first met Comrade Yang Jingyu in the spring of 1932 in occupied Harbin. At that time, we all called him "Old Zhang." He was the secretary of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee, and I was working in the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Youth League Committee.

    Comrade Yang Jingyu was a very experienced underground worker. Once, we arranged to meet on the banks of the Songhua River. It was just after the river had thawed, and ice floes of all sizes were floating down from upstream. We sat by the river, watching the ice floes while we talked. A Japanese plane flew from south of the river to north of the river, circled over the Songhua River Railway Bridge, and then flew north again. Comrade Yang Jingyu said to me, "Japanese imperialism is showing off to us." Just then, he suddenly burst out laughing, and then leisurely picked up a stone and threw it at a large ice floe in the middle of the river. I found it a bit strange. After a while, he explained:

    "I just noticed someone standing on the riverbank behind us. If we talk with serious faces, it will increase his suspicion, so we have to use a loud laugh to send him away."

    So we stood up, our faces full of smiles, admiring the river scenery, and talking about our work while walking…

    Between the autumn and winter of that year, Comrade Yang Jingyu was sent to Panshi County in southern Manchuria to lead the anti-Japanese guerrilla forces organized by the Party. In the winter, Liu Guofeng, a Youth League member who went with him, returned from Panshi to report to the Provincial Committee on the development of the guerrilla forces there.

    Under the leadership of Comrade Yang Jingyu, the Panshi guerrilla forces had greatly developed, forming a light cavalry unit with three hundred cavalrymen. They were quick and mobile, operated over a wide area, and established united front ties with other anti-Japanese volunteer armies in southern Manchuria.

    In the autumn of 1933, Comrade Yang Jingyu was recalled to Harbin to participate in a meeting of the Provincial Committee to discuss the implementation of the Central Committee's directive letter of March 26. This was an important instruction that changed the entire Northeast anti-Japanese struggle line. Based on this instruction, through this meeting, Comrade Yang Jingyu went to the localities to implement the Central Committee's policy, reorganized the guerrilla forces led by our Party (then known as the Northeast Independent Division of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army) into the People's Anti-Japanese Army, and on this basis, formed a united front with volunteer armies in other parts of Northeast China, forming the Anti-Japanese United Army, realizing the Party's leadership over all anti-Japanese forces in Northeast China.

    At that time, the enemy and puppets had very strict control over household registration, and the White Terror was very severe. Because my family had elderly parents, which provided better cover to the outside world, Comrade Yang Jingyu stayed at my house after arriving in Harbin. That historic meeting was held during the Mid-Autumn Festival. We used the method of inviting guests for the holiday to accommodate all the responsible comrades of the Manchuria Provincial Committee at that time. After lunch, the table where the meeting was held was also filled with fruit and mooncakes, creating a festive atmosphere. The meeting was very smooth and safe.

    Comrade Yang Jingyu lived in my house for about a month, like a member of the family, helping us with housework whenever he had time. He also often told us stories of battles, telling us how Comrade Liu Guofeng was chased by the enemy while holding a draft document and fled to the mountains, where he was shot and killed. The draft paper stuck on a tree branch like a flag waving in the wind; a middle-aged comrade with lung disease who had always been with him, lost his composure during a fierce battle, rushed down the mountain with a gun, and before he could call him to stop, the comrade was shot and rolled down the mountain…

    Clear snot often dripped from Comrade Yang Jingyu's nose. He told us that it was because he was once captured by the enemy and hung upside down on a wooden frame used to trim horses' hooves. The enemy poured horse urine into his nose, and his nose was damaged ever since.

    He talked about how the guerrilla forces were supported by the masses: Once, during a battle in the mountains, an old lady at the foot of the mountain set up an incense table and kowtowed, praying to the Bodhisattva to bless the Red Army to win the battle. At that time, the people in the Panshi area really didn't believe that our guerrilla forces were composed of ordinary workers and peasants. They rumored that they were heavenly soldiers and generals, sent from heaven to save the people from the Japanese puppet regime's fiery pit. Some bandit leaders, when they "met horses" with Comrade Yang Jingyu, would often roll off their horses and kneel down to him. Another bandit leader, after dismounting, did not kneel, but cupped his hands and called him "General Team Leader." Comrade Yang Jingyu thought these three words were very interesting.

    Comrade Yang Jingyu would read newspapers and books whenever he had time. He also worked hard to learn to sing. Several times we used a harmonica to gently accompany him while learning to sing "The Internationale." We also tried to compose a "Northeast People's Revolutionary Army March," but we didn't succeed.

    When he left, he pawned his gray serge coat and a single-width kang quilt, and asked my mother to keep the pawn ticket, so that he could redeem them for use when he came to Harbin again. But he never returned to Harbin. When the clothes were about to expire, my mother redeemed them. Later, my family left Harbin for Shanghai, and my mother kept these two items. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, we learned that Comrade Yang Jingyu had been sacrificed. My mother cried several times after learning this news. After liberation, we sent these two relics of Comrade Yang Jingyu to the Harbin Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Hall for preservation.

    Today, Comrade Yang Jingyu is to be buried in Tonghua County, where he sacrificed himself. May he rest in peace. The lofty ideals and great cause for which he fought and sacrificed have been gradually realized, and are now being realized by leaps and bounds. His calm, kind, and resolute image will forever live in our hearts along with his glorious achievements.

    忆杨靖宇同志
    姜椿芳
    最初认识杨靖宇同志是在1932年春天，在沦陷的哈尔滨。那时我们都唤他叫“老张”，他是党的哈尔滨市委书记，我当时担任团市委宣传部的工作。
    杨靖宇同志是一个相当老练的地下工作者。有一次我们约好在松花江边碰头。那时刚开江，大大小小的冰块从上游飘浮下来。我们坐在江边上，一面看着冰块，一面谈话。一架日本飞机从江南飞往江北，然后在松花江大铁桥的上空转了一圈，又飞往江北。杨靖宇同志对我说：“日本帝国主义向我们示威来了。”正在这时候，他突然放声大笑起来，接着又很悠闲地拣起一颗石子向江心一个大冰块掷去。我觉得有些奇怪。过了一会，他才解释说：
    “刚才发现一个人站在我们后面的江岸上，我们板着脸谈话会增加他的猜疑，只得用一声高笑把他打发走。”
    于是我们站起来，脸上堆满笑容，赏玩着江景，边走边说地谈着我们的工作问题……
    这年秋冬之间，杨靖宇同志被派往南满磐石县去领导党所组织的抗日游击队。冬天，和他同去的青年团员刘过风同志从磐石回来，向省委报告那边游击队发展的情况。
    在杨靖宇同志领导之下，磐石游击队有了很大的发展，组成了一支有三百多骑兵的轻骑队，来往神速，活动范围很广，并且和南满其他各种抗日义勇军建立了统一战线的联系。
    1933年秋天，杨靖宇同志被召回哈尔滨，参加省委讨论贯彻中央3月26日指示信的会议。这是改变整个东北抗日斗争路线的重要指示。就是根据这一指示，通过这次会议，杨靖宇同志到地方上去贯彻中央的方针，把我们党所领导的游击队（当时称为中国工农红军三十三军东北独立师）改组成为人民抗日军，并且以此为基础，和东北其他各地义勇军结成统一战线，组成抗日联军，实现了党对东北所有抗日力量的领导。
    那时敌伪控制户口很严，白色恐怖很厉害，由于我家里有年老的父母，对外掩护比较好，杨靖宇同志到哈尔滨后就住在我家。那次历史性的会议是在中秋节开的。我们用请客过节的方式，家里容纳了当时满洲省委的全部负责同志。午饭之后，在开会的桌子上也摆满了水果和月饼，造成节日气氛。那次会议开得很顺利、很安全。
    杨靖宇同志在我家前后住了一月之久，像一家人一样，一有空就帮着我们做家务。他也常常和我们谈起战斗的故事，讲到刘过风同志怎样手拿一张正在起草的文件被敌人追逐而逃往山上去的时候，中弹牺牲。那张草稿纸戳在树枝上像一面旗子在风里飘动；一向跟着他一起的一位有肺病的中年同志，一次激战时沉不住气，拿着枪冲下山去，在他还唤着他站住的时候，那位同志已中弹滚下山去了……
    杨靖宇同志的鼻子里经常流下清水鼻涕。他告诉我们，那是有一次他被敌人捉住，被倒吊在给马修脚掌的木架子上，敌人用马尿灌进他的鼻子里，从此他的鼻子便弄坏了。
    他讲起游击队怎样受到群众的拥护：有一次在山上作战，山下有一个老太太摆了香案，叩头求菩萨保佑红军打胜仗。磐石一带的老百姓那时真有人不相信我们的游击队是普通工农组成的，他们传说这是天神天将，是天上派下来救老百姓跳出日伪火坑的。有些胡匪性质的首领，和杨靖宇同志“碰马”，往往一骨碌滚下马来，向他下跪。还有一个胡匪头目，下了马，不是下跪，而是拱拱手，口称“总队员”。杨靖宇同志觉得这三个字用得很有趣味。
    杨靖宇同志一有空便看报看书。他还努力学唱歌，有几次我们用口琴轻轻地伴奏学唱“国际歌”。我们还试着编“东北人民革命军军歌”，但没有编成。
    他临去时把他所穿的一件灰哔叽大褂和所盖的一条单幅的炕被当掉，拿当票请我母亲保存，预备再来哈尔滨时赎出来应用。但是他从此没有再回哈尔滨，在衣服快要满期的时候，我母亲把它赎了出来。后来我家离开哈尔滨到上海，母亲一直保存着这两件东西。1945年日军投降后才得悉杨靖宇同志已经牺牲。我母亲得悉这个消息后，曾哭了好几次。解放后，我们把杨靖宇同志的这两件遗物送往哈尔滨革命烈士纪念馆保存。
    今天，杨靖宇同志要在他牺牲的通化县安葬了，但愿他安眠吧，他为之奋斗和牺牲的那个崇高的理想和伟大的事业已经逐步实现，而且现在正在飞跃地实现着。他那沉静、和善而坚决的形象将和他的光辉的勋绩永久活在我们的心里。
