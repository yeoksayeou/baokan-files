So that urban and industrial residents can eat enough vegetables year-round
Representative Li Yanlu reports on the situation of solving vegetable supply problems in Heilongjiang Province
I fully support the reports made to the congress by Vice Chairman Peng, Vice Premiers Li and Bo, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now I will talk about the situation in Heilongjiang Province regarding solving the vegetable supply problem.

Vegetable supply once tight, prices rose
In the past two or three years, the insufficient supply and rising prices of vegetables in the winter and spring seasons in Heilongjiang Province have become a prominent problem in the supply of non-staple foods, and the people have many opinions about this. Our province has a cold climate, and only four or five months of the year are suitable for growing vegetables, so the production volume is very small. In the spring of 1957, the eight major cities and mines in the province could only eat four or five taels of vegetables per person per day, and a catty of Chinese cabbage cost 20 cents. Although a large number of vegetables were transferred from other provinces, it still could not meet the market supply. The reasons for the insufficient vegetable supply are mainly: insufficient arrangements for vegetable production, resulting in insufficient output; lax management of vegetables after the opening of the free market, leading to price increases, and affecting price fluctuations to some extent. For example, the retail market commodity price index in the first quarter of 1957 rose by 4.1 percent compared to the first quarter of 1956, of which more than 90 percent was caused by vegetable prices.

Taking measures to increase production and pay attention to storage - The situation has improved since last winter and the masses are satisfied
Because of the timely attention to this problem and the measures taken, in order to ensure that the people of the whole province can eat vegetables all year round, it is necessary to solve it from production and storage. Therefore, at the beginning of 1957, our province deployed the task of arranging vegetable production to ensure supply. After the State Council convened a vegetable work conference, in accordance with the correct policy of the Central Committee, party and government leaders at all levels personally led and mobilized the masses to work together, so that vegetable production has achieved great development. In 1957, our province's eight major cities and mines had 3.08 million people, and a total of 793,830 mu of vegetables were sown, an increase of 20.2 percent compared to 1956. The total output reached 763,267 tons, an increase of 35.6 percent compared to 1956. Each person ate 352 catties of vegetables throughout the year, an increase of about one-half compared to 1956. Because production developed and output increased, the price of vegetables in 1957 also dropped a lot compared to 1956. Taking Chinese cabbage as an example, it cost 18 to 20 cents per catty in the winter of 1956, but only 6 cents per catty last winter, a decrease of two-thirds. Since last winter, the vegetable supply has greatly improved both in quantity and quality, and the masses are satisfied. Our province also suffered a great natural disaster last autumn for vegetable crops. According to statistics, the production was reduced by more than 164 million catties. Therefore, although some vegetables still need to be transferred from other provinces this winter and spring to solve the supply during the period of scarcity, we believe that if the safety factor is appropriately increased, it can be basically self-sufficient.

Establish vegetable production bases according to urban needs - Plant enough vegetables and improve storage methods
We feel that the main reasons why our province's vegetable work can be further resolved are: the central government's policy of "nearby production, nearby supply, zoning according to cities, and basic self-sufficiency" is completely correct. According to this policy of the Central Committee, we established vegetable production bases according to the supply needs of the urban population, planting enough vegetables and setting safety factors to achieve self-sufficiency; secondly, the assistance and support of the urban service departments helped us to carry out production planning, and allocated 7.6 million yuan in total to support investment in newly expanded vegetable fields and the construction of vegetable cellars; thirdly, according to two years of experience, state-owned operation is the main method, and the methods of contracting production and sales, unified distribution, and regional sales can give play to the enthusiasm of vegetable farmers, control the market, and stabilize vegetable prices; fourthly, party and government leaders personally started to grasp vegetable work, leading the masses to study measures to increase production and various storage methods to avoid excessive losses caused by long-term storage.

Harbin City did a good job in storage and preservation - The increased vegetables suffered little loss, ensuring supply
Now I will talk about the vegetable work in Harbin City and Ning'an County. In 1957, the vegetable planting area in Harbin City reached 394,755 mu, and the total output reached 381,489 tons. The supply in the fourth quarter increased by two-thirds compared to 1956. However, from the perspective of our province, the increase in vegetable production does not mean that there is no problem with the supply. The key is to do a good job in storage and preservation. In order to ensure the vegetable supply, after winning a great victory in the flood control struggle, Harbin City encountered a serious threat of early frost, so it mobilized 100,000 government cadres to rush to the suburbs to help the production cooperatives harvest Chinese cabbage, and harvested 3,800 tons of Chinese cabbage in just half a day and a night. In addition, it also organized 40,000 cars and carts to transport 100,000 tons of vegetables. In order to do a good job in storage in a timely manner, the service departments in Harbin City also dispatched a large number of employees to do voluntary labor to dig and build vegetable cellars during the tense climax of flood control, and completed the task of 46,000 square meters before the end of October. According to the statistics at the end of last December, the city stored a total of 59,628 tons of vegetables, including 29,939 tons stored by agricultural cooperatives, 15,689 tons stored by state-owned companies, and 14,000 tons stored by government offices and residents. What is the role of storing so many vegetables? First, vegetable farmers sell them one after another. From the perspective of price, the purchase price of newly listed vegetables is 2.2 cents per catty, and the average purchase price in spring is 6.45 cents, which can increase the income by 16.2 yuan per mu. Second, it can reduce imports from other provinces. If the city calculates 100 million catties, it can save 6 million yuan. Third, consumers also benefit from storing vegetables, not only cheaper than in spring, but also can eat six taels more vegetables every day. Last year, the city's fourth-quarter price level decreased by 37 percent compared to the same period in 1956. These tasks were carried out under the personal leadership of the leading comrades of the municipal party committee and the municipal people's committee. Therefore, the people of Harbin City deeply feel that the party and the government are always planning for the interests of the people based on these vivid facts.

Ning'an Town applied fertilizer in a timely and appropriate manner, greatly increasing production - Transferred 4,000 tons of vegetables to support the needs of cities and mines
Ning'an County is one of the thirteen vegetable production bases in our province. In 1957, Ning'an Town sowed a total of 14,760 mu of vegetables. In addition to ensuring self-sufficiency, the county transferred 4,000 tons of vegetables to support the needs of other cities and mines in the province. In 1957, Ning'an County not only met the local needs and supported the supply of other cities and mines, but also increased the income of farmers due to the expansion of vegetable production. Last year, the average income of vegetable farmers in the county was 700 to 800 yuan per labor force, which was about two-thirds higher than the income from growing large fields. Last year, while expanding the planting area, the county also took measures to increase the production of Chinese cabbage by applying chemical fertilizer (ammonium sulfate). According to last year's results, it has a great effect on increasing the yield per unit area. For example, the Hongcheng Cooperative in the county conducted an experiment on 1,500 mu of small-rooted Chinese cabbage fields. On average, the use of 300 catties of chemical fertilizer per mu increased the production of 1.5 million catties of Chinese cabbage, which is equal to the output of expanding 750 mu of vegetable fields. On average, one catty of chemical fertilizer can increase the production of 50 catties of Chinese cabbage. The main experience gained by the county in increasing the application of chemical fertilizer is: topdressing must be timely and appropriate, generally divided into two to three times, with fertilizer applied in stages; chemical fertilizer should be used in combination with organic fertilizers such as manure and thin manure. Generally, organic fertilizers should be used as base fertilizer, and chemical fertilizers should be used as topdressing, and water should be watered in time to prevent diseases and insect pests. The production plan of Ning'an Town in 1958 has been formulated, and it is planned to sow 28,860 mu, actively develop water garden production, make full use of urban manure resources, strengthen the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, strengthen leadership, so as to complete the vegetable production and supply tasks.

This year, specific measures will be taken to increase vegetable production - Each person will be able to eat 1 catty and 4 taels per day
This year, the supply population of the eight major cities, mines and forest areas in our province is still calculated at 3.08 million people (excluding the suburbs). The planned planting area is 1.05 million mu, and the thirteen base counties are 105,000 mu, totaling 1.155 million mu. The safety factor is 26.31 percent, and the total output can reach 1.47 million tons. Each person can eat an average of 1 catty and 4 taels of vegetables per day. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, in addition to appropriately expanding the vegetable planting area in individual areas, the main task is to realize the plan of planting two crops and increase the yield per unit area. The specific methods are: (1) expand water garden land, from 15,000 mu in the province last year to 75,000 mu; (2) use urban manure resources to increase manure application, plan to apply base fertilizer and topdressing three times; (3) select excellent seeds locally, because the excellent seeds cultivated in the province produce much more than the seeds introduced from other provinces in the past; (4) eliminate vegetable diseases and insect pests; (5) strengthen technical guidance, implement intercropping, mixed cropping, and intercropping. We will take the above measures to promote a great leap forward in vegetable production, and also make a great leap forward in vegetable storage and preservation, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetable supply this year.

    让城市工矿区居民常年吃到足够的蔬菜
    李延禄代表报告黑龙江省解决蔬菜供应问题的情况
    我完全拥护彭副委员长和李、薄副总理及吴玉章主任向大会所作的各项报告。现在我谈一谈黑龙江省关于解决蔬菜供应问题的情况。
    蔬菜供应一度紧张　价格上涨
    近二、三年以来，黑龙江省冬春两季蔬菜供应不足，价格上涨，已经成为副食品供应中一个突出的问题，人民对此意见很多。我省气候寒冷，一年只有四五个月的时间可以生长蔬菜，生产量很少。一九五七年春季，全省八个主要市矿，每人每天只能吃到四五两菜，一斤大白菜要二角来钱，从省外虽然调入了大批的蔬菜，但是仍不能满足市场的供应。蔬菜供应不足的原因，主要是：对蔬菜生产安排不够，产量不足；开放自由市场后对蔬菜管理不严，价格上涨，并且影响了物价的一度波动。如一九五七年第一季度比一九五六年第一季度零售市场商品价格指数上升百分之四点一，其中百分之九十以上是蔬菜价格造成的。
    采取措施增加生产注意贮存  去冬以来情况好转群众满意
    由于及时重视了这个问题，采取了措施，为了保证全省人民常年吃到蔬菜，必须从生产上和贮存上来解决。所以在一九五七年初，我省布置了安排蔬菜生产保证供应的任务。经过国务院召开蔬菜工作会议，按照中央的正确方针，各级党政亲自领导和发动群众一齐动手，使蔬菜生产获得了很大的发展。一九五七年我省八个主要市矿有三百零八万人，共播种了蔬菜七十九万三千八百三十亩，较一九五六年扩大了百分之二十点二，总产量达七十六万三千二百六十七吨，较一九五六年增加百分之三十五点六，每人全年吃菜三百五十二斤，较一九五六年增加二分之一左右。由于生产发展了，产量增加了，因此一九五七年的蔬菜价格也较一九五六年下降很多，就以大白菜来说，一九五六年冬季每斤要一角八分到二角钱，去年冬季每斤只要六分，下降三分之二。自去冬以来的蔬菜供应，无论在数量上和质量上均大有好转，群众感到满意。我省去年秋菜还遭受了很大的自然灾害，据统计要减产一亿六千四百万斤以上，因此，去冬今春虽然还需要从省外调入一些蔬菜解决春季青黄不接期间的供应，但是我们认为如果安全系数再适当加大，就可以做到基本自给。
    按城市需要建立蔬菜生产基地  把蔬菜种足种够改进贮藏办法
    我们感到我省蔬菜工作能够进一步解决，其主要原因是：中央确定的“就近生产，就近供应，按城划片，基本自给”的方针是完全正确的。根据中央这一方针，我们按城市人口供应需要建立蔬菜生产基地，把蔬菜种足种够，并订出安全系数，做到自给；其次，城市服务部的协助与支持，帮助我们搞生产规划，并在促进与扶植生产上共拨给七百六十万元支持新扩大菜田的投资和修建菜窖的资用；第三，根据两年来的经验，以国营经营为主，采取包产包销，统一分配，分区销售，才能发挥菜农的积极性，才能控制市场，稳定蔬菜价格；第四，党政领导同志亲自动手抓蔬菜工作，领导群众研究增产措施和各种贮藏办法，避免因较长时间的贮存而造成过多的损失。
    哈尔滨市做好了贮存保管工作  增产的蔬菜损失小保证了供应
    现在我再讲一下哈尔滨市和宁安县的蔬菜工作情况。哈尔滨市一九五七年蔬菜播种面积达到三十九万四千七百五十五亩，总产量达三十八万一千四百八十九吨，四季度供应量较一九五六年增加三分之二。但是从我省情况来看，蔬菜增产了，并不等于供应没有问题了，而关键在于做好贮存保管工作。哈尔滨市为保证蔬菜供应，在取得防汛斗争的伟大胜利后，遇到了严重的早霜的威胁，于是动员机关干部十万人，立即赶赴郊区帮助生产社抢收大白菜，仅半天一夜即抢收了大白菜三千八百吨，此外，还组织了四万辆汽车、马车抢运了蔬菜十万吨。为了及时做好贮存工作，哈尔滨市在防汛的紧张的高潮期间，服务部门还出动了大批职工义务劳动挖建菜窖，在十月底以前即完成了四万六千平方米的任务，截至去年十二月底的统计，全市共贮存蔬菜达五万九千六百二十八吨，其中农业社贮存二万九千九百三十九吨，国营公司一万五千六百八十九吨，机关和居民一万四千吨。贮存这么多的菜究竟有什么作用呢？第一，菜农陆续卖出，从价格上看，新上市每斤收购二分二厘，春季平均收价为六分四厘五，每亩地可增加收入十六元二角。第二，可以减少从省外调入，全市按一亿斤计算，即可节省费用六百万元。第三，消费者贮存也是有好处的，不仅比在春季要便宜，而且可以每天多吃六两菜。去年全市四季度价格水平较一九五六年同期下降百分之三十七。这些工作都是在市委、市人委的领导同志的亲自领导下进行的，因此哈尔滨市的人民，对这些活生生的事实，深刻地感到党和政府是时刻为人民利益而打算的。
    宁安镇施肥及时恰当大量增产  调出四千吨蔬菜支援市矿需要
    宁安县是我省的十三个蔬菜生产基地之一。一九五七年宁安镇共播种了蔬菜一万四千七百六十亩，全县去年除保证自给外，并外调了四千吨蔬菜，支援省内其他市矿的需要。该县一九五七年由于扩大了蔬菜生产，因此不仅满足了当地的需要，外调支援了其他市矿的供应，同时，也增加农民的收入。去年全县菜农收入平均每个劳动力为七百元至八百元，较种大田的收入高三分之二左右。去年该县在扩大生产面积的同时，还采取增施化肥（硫铵）增产大白菜的工作。根据去年的结果，对提高单位面积产量有了很大的作用，如该县红城社在一千五百亩小根白菜田作了试验，平均每亩使用化肥三百斤就增产一百五十万斤白菜，等于扩大七百五十亩菜田的产量，平均一斤化肥可以增产白菜五十斤。在增施化肥的工作方面，该县取得的主要经验是：追施必须及时恰当，一般分二至三次，分期追肥；化肥使用配合粪稀等有机肥料，一般底肥宜用有机肥，化肥作为追肥，并及时浇水，防止病虫害。宁安镇一九五八年的生产规划已经拟订，计划播种面积达二万八千八百六十亩，积极发展水园生产，作好充分利用城市粪源，以及加强防治病虫害等工作，加强领导，以便完成蔬菜生产与供应任务。
    今年采取具体办法增产蔬菜  每人每天将可吃到一斤四两
    今年我省八个主要市矿林区的供应人口仍按三百零八万人计算（不包括郊区），计划播种面积为一百零五万亩，十三个基地县为十万五千亩，共为一百一十五万五千亩，安全系数为百分之二十六点三一，总产量可达一百四十七万吨，每人每天平均可吃菜一斤四两。为了保证这个计划的实现，除个别地区适当扩大蔬菜耕种面积外，主要实现种两楂的计划和提高单位面积产量，具体办法是：（1）扩大水园地，由去年全省一万五千亩增加到七万五千亩；
  （2）利用城市粪源，增施粪肥，计划除上底粪外，还追肥三次；（3）精选优良种子，当地采种，因为省内培育的优良种子比过去由省外进入的种子增产很多；（4）消灭蔬菜的病虫害；（5）加强技术指导，施行复种、混种、套种。我们采取上述措施，来促进蔬菜生产大跃进，并且在蔬菜贮存保管工作上也来个大跃进，争取今年作到蔬菜供应自给。
