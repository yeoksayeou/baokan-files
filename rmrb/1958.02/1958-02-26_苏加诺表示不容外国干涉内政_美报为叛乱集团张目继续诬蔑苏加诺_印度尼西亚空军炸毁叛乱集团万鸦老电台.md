Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 24th. President Sukarno reiterated on February 24th, when receiving representatives from the Indonesian Republic Student Army Congress, that a certain foreign power is attempting to pull all of Indonesia, or part of Indonesia, into a certain bloc.

He said that during his visits abroad, he clearly knew that a certain foreign power had already been interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. He pointed out that after the current situation changed, one of the two blocs became dissatisfied with Indonesia's pursuit of an active independent policy and demanded that Indonesia lean to one side. Therefore, this bloc interfered in Indonesia's internal affairs.

President Sukarno said that Indonesia would not ignore this kind of foreign interference. He said that the government and all the Indonesian people have a responsibility to save the Republic of Indonesia and prevent the conspiracy of certain elements to pull all of Indonesia, or part of Indonesia, into a certain bloc from succeeding.

President Sukarno said that the rebellion in Padang was an illegal act. This act was an attempt to force the legitimate government to accept a certain will by taking measures outside of parliament. Therefore, resolute measures must be taken against this illegal act.

The participants of the Indonesian Republic Student Army Congress went to the Presidential Palace on the 24th to submit their resolutions. These resolutions stated that these retired student soldiers were willing to take up their guns again to fight the Hussein rebellion group. The Indonesian Republic Student Army was an armed student organization during the struggle for independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 25th. According to Antara News Agency, the Indonesian Air Force authorities officially announced on the 24th that Indonesian Air Force planes had bombed a radio station in Manado, North Sulawesi, which was under the control of the so-called "revolutionary government."

According to the Air Force authorities, when the Air Force planes bombed the Manado radio station, they had first fired warning shots at residents near the target to allow them to evacuate, just as they had done when bombing the Padang and Bukittinggi radio stations of the rebel group in Central Sumatra.

Antara News Agency also quoted news from Makassar as saying that since the 22nd, shipping and telecommunications links from North Sulawesi to other places have been cut off. Prior to this, all financial ties to the rebel areas had been severed.

North Sulawesi is under the control of the "Total Struggle Charter" group, which implements military separation. Because the leading figures of this group, such as Sombah, recently expressed support for the so-called "revolutionary government" established by the Central Sumatra rebel group, the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army has ordered their arrest.

Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. American newspapers on the 24th did not conceal their hostility towards the Sukarno government when commenting on the Indonesian situation. The "New York Herald Tribune," reflecting official opinion, called the Indonesian rebels "revolutionaries." It threatened that these "revolutionaries" would use "force to change the personnel and policies under President Sukarno's rule." For the Jakarta government to achieve a "compromise," it would have to "make concessions" to the rebels' demands and end "guided democracy."

In an editorial, the "New York Times" reversed black and white, insisting that Indonesia's "civil war" was "launched" by Sukarno. It said that the separatists' demand for "local autonomy" was "sound" and that Sukarno had ruined this demand. The editorial openly cheered for the rebels' actions and advocated intervention by "outside bodies" such as the United Nations in the current situation in Indonesia.

    苏加诺表示不容外国干涉内政
    美报为叛乱集团张目继续诬蔑苏加诺
    印度尼西亚空军炸毁叛乱集团万鸦老电台
    新华社雅加达24日电　苏加诺总统24日在接见印度尼西亚共和国学生军代表大会的代表时再次表明，某种外国势力正在企图把整个印度尼西亚或者印度尼西亚的一部分拉入某个集团。
    他说，当他在国外访问期间，他清楚地知道，某种外国势力已经在干涉印度尼西亚的内政。他指出，在现在局势起了变化以后，两个集团中的一个对印度尼西亚奉行积极的独立政策感到不满，并且要求印度尼西亚倒向一边。他说，因此，这个集团就干涉了印度尼西亚的内政。
    苏加诺总统说，印度尼西亚对外国的这种干涉不会置之不理。他说，政府和全体印度尼西亚人民有责任拯救印度尼西亚共和国，不让某些分子企图把整个印度尼西亚或者印度尼西亚的一部分拉入某个集团的阴谋得逞。
    苏加诺总统说，在巴东发生的叛乱事件是违反法律的行为。这种行为是企图通过采取议会以外的办法来迫使合法的政府接受某种意志。因此，必须对这种违法行为采取坚决措施。
    印度尼西亚共和国学生军代表大会的参加者们24日到总统府去递交他们的决议。这些决议表示，这些已经退伍的学生军愿意再次扛起枪杆去打侯赛尼叛乱集团。印度尼西亚共和国学生军是争取独立斗争期间的一个武装学生组织。
    新华社雅加达25日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚空军当局在24日正式宣布，印度尼西亚空军飞机在北苏拉威西的万鸦老炸毁了一座在所谓“革命政府”控制下的广播电台。
    据空军当局宣布，空军飞机在轰炸万鸦老电台时，像轰炸中苏门答腊叛乱集团的巴东和布吉丁宜电台一样，曾经事先放枪警告目标附近的居民，使他们疏散。
    安塔拉通讯社还援引来自望加锡的消息说，从22日起，从北苏拉威西通往外地的航运和电讯联络都已经被切断。在这以前，通往叛乱地区的所有财政联系都已经断绝了。
    北苏拉威西是在实行军事割据的“全面斗争约章”集团控制之下的。由于这个集团的首要分子宋巴等人最近表示支持中苏门答腊叛乱集团成立的所谓“革命政府”，印度尼西亚陆军参谋长已经下令逮捕他们。
    新华社25日讯　美国报纸24日在评论印度尼西亚局势时毫不掩饰它们对苏加诺政府的敌意。反映官方意见的“纽约先驱论坛报”把印度尼西亚的叛乱分子称为“革命者”，它威胁说，这些“革命者”要用“武力使苏加诺总统执政下的人员和政策有所改变”，雅加达政府要取得“折衷办法”就要对叛乱分子的要求“作出让步”，结束“有指导的民主”。
    “纽约时报”在社论中颠倒黑白，硬说印度尼西亚的“内战”是苏加诺“发动”的。它说，分裂主义者要求“地方自治”的主张是“健全的”，是苏加诺把这种主张毁了。社论公然为叛乱分子的行动打气，并且鼓吹由联合国这样的“外界机构”对印度尼西亚目前局势进行干预。
