　　Striving to Go Upstream
　　Wan Xiangxin
　　Making plans according to the spirit of promotion is already a well-known slogan for enterprise leaders. Many enterprises are indeed doing so. The leaders of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation initially moved the date for putting the No. 1 blast furnace system into production from 1959 to the end of 1958, which was a promotional action; however, they were not satisfied and recently moved the date for putting it into production forward by another quarter. This even more fully demonstrates revolutionary vigor.
　　However, some enterprise leaders are not like this. Driven by the nationwide great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, they also made some modifications to the original backward and conservative plans. But after just taking one step forward, they became complacent. Have all the potentials been tapped, and have all the favorable factors in all aspects been fully utilized? They did not carefully consider it, but thought it was "almost there." Can the plan really be "almost there" after being revised once? No. In most cases, it is "far from it." For example, the Changzhou Machine Factory's plan to produce internal combustion engines this year, after "bargaining," was revised three times, increasing from 205 units to 765 units, and many leaders thought it had reached the "top." However, after mass discussion, it was raised to 1,362 units.
　　Production potential is difficult to fully estimate at once. Thinking lagging behind reality is a common occurrence. After the basic completion of the socialist revolution on the economic front, people often cannot figure out the thunderous momentum of the newly liberated productive forces. Productive forces include the means of production and people. People can more easily grasp the potential of the means of production; however, it is often difficult to accurately estimate people's labor enthusiasm and creativity. Some people may ask: How powerful are the newly liberated productive forces and the masses' labor enthusiasm inspired by the rectification movement? Our answer is: How powerful is nuclear fission, that is how powerful they are! All enterprise leaders need to have such an awareness: their thinking may lag behind reality at any time, so they must always be vigilant about lagging behind, always remember to rush forward, and formulate plans and measures that are more advanced and even more advanced.
　　Some leaders stop making progress after making some progress because they have an unspeakable little plan: hoping to live a smooth and stable life. They are afraid of difficulties and unwilling to spend more effort. After slightly modifying the backward and conservative plan, they comfort themselves: this plan, even if it is "not as good as the best," is already "better than the worst"; raising it further would require working day and night and racking their brains. These comrades have forgotten a simple truth: making revolution and engaging in construction are inherently labor-intensive and mentally taxing things. In the current surging high tide of socialist construction, not riding the waves and being an eagle, but wanting to "steal leisure from busy times," isn't this an indecent thing?
　　True promoters always strive to go upstream. They are neither complacent because of slight progress, nor will they be frightened by any difficulties.

　　力争上游
　　万向辛
    按照促进的精神订计划，已经是企业领导人员人人皆知的口号。许多企业的确在这么办。武钢领导人第一次把一号高炉系统投入生产的日期由1959年提前到1958年底，这是一个促进的行动；可是他们并没有满足，最近又把投入生产的日期提前了一个季度。这更充分表现了革命的干劲。
    有一部分企业的领导人员却不是这样。他们在全国工农业生产大跃进形势的推动下，也对原来落后保守的计划作了一些修改。但是在刚刚前进了一步以后，便自满起来。是不是潜力已经挖尽，是不是各方面有利因素都已经充分利用了？他们没有仔细考虑，便认为“差不多”了。计划修改过一次，真能作到“差不多”吗？否。多数情况都是“差得多”。例如，常州机器厂今年生产内燃机的计划，经过“讨价还价”，三次修改，由二百零五台增加到七百六十五台，许多领导人员就以为已经“到顶”了。可是经过群众讨论，又提高到一千三百六十二台。
    生产的潜力是难以一下作出充分估计的。思想落后于实际是一条常规。在经济战线上社会主义革命基本完成以后，对新解放的生产力的雷霆万钧之势，人们往往摸不清底细。生产力包括生产工具和人。对生产工具的潜力，人们还比较容易掌握；但是，对于人的劳动热情和创造性，就常常难以估计清楚。有人会问：新解放了的生产力以及受到整风运动的鼓舞的群众劳动热情，究竟有多大威力？我们的回答是：原子核分裂有多大威力，它们就有多大威力！所有企业的领导人员，都需要有这样一种自觉：自己的思想时时都可能落后于实际，因此，必须时时警惕落后，时时记着往前赶，把计划、措施制定得先进再先进。
    有些领导人员所以稍有进展就裹足不前，还因为有个不可告人的小算盘：希望平平稳稳地过日子。他们害怕困难，不愿意多花费气力。把落后保守的计划稍加修改以后，便自己安慰自己：这个计划即使是“比上不足”，却已是“比下有余”；再提高就该日夜劳神，大伤脑筋了。这些同志忘记了一条简单的真理：闹革命、搞建设，本来就是劳神费力的事情。在目前汹涌澎湃的社会主义建设高潮中，不去乘风破浪，作一只雄鹰，而想“忙里偷闲”，这不是一件见不得人的事情吗？
    真正的促进派，永远是力争上游的。他既不因稍有进展而自满，也不会为任何困难所吓住。
