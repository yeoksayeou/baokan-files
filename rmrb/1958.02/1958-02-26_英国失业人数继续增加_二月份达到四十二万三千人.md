    Xinhua News Agency, London, February 25th: According to an announcement made by the British Minister of Labour and National Service, Macleod, in the House of Commons on the evening of the 24th, the number of unemployed in Britain in February was approximately 423,000, an increase of approximately 28,000 from January. The January unemployment figure was already the highest in five years.

    Macleod said that the February unemployment rate accounted for 1.9% of the total employed population. The figure for January was 1.8%. He also said that the increase in unemployment in February was a "real rather than seasonal increase."

    Labour Party Member of Parliament, Griffiths, on behalf of the Labour Party, presented a motion in the House of Commons requesting the House to "express concern" about the recent increase in unemployment in many regions and to demand that the government "take appropriate measures to improve the situation." He said that the overall trend seems to indicate that Britain is entering a period of widespread unemployment growth.

    二月份达到四十二万三千人
    新华社25日讯　伦敦消息：据英国劳工和国民兵役大臣麦克劳德24日晚间在下院宣布，英国2月份的失业人数约有四十二万三千人，比1月份又增加了约二万八千人，而1月份的失业人数已经是五年来最高的数字。
    麦克劳德说，2月份失业人数占全体就业人数的1.9％。1月份这个数字是1.8％。他还说，2月份失业人数的增长是一种“真正的而非季节性的增长”。
    工党议员葛莱菲斯代表工党在下院提出了一项动议，要求下院对最近许多地区失业增长的现象“表示关心”，并且要求政府“采取适当的措施来改善这种形势”。他说，目前总的趋势似乎表明英国正在进入失业普遍增长的时期。
