Xinhua News Agency Report: Liaoning Province plans to realize the mechanization and modernization of agriculture during the Second Five-Year Plan period. The mechanized cultivation area should reach more than 80% of the province's cultivated land; 50%-60% of the townships will achieve electrification. This was decided at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the 15th.

The main directions of agricultural mechanization and modernization in Liaoning Province are: to realize mechanization in farming, water conservancy, and agricultural and sideline product processing; to greatly develop the production of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, veterinary drugs, etc.; and to build a large number of small rural power stations.

In order to complete this arduous task, the industrial and agricultural departments of Liaoning Province will first establish research institutions for agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides to investigate and study the actual needs of agricultural mechanization and modernization construction and the purchasing power of rural areas; and widely collect technical information and drawings for agricultural mechanization and modernization. While formulating plans for realizing agricultural mechanization and modernization, local industrial departments will assist in the trial production and mass manufacture of various suitable mechanical products. In addition to manufacturing the state's planned products, local industry throughout the province will fully undertake the production of small machinery and miscellaneous tools, and county industry and handicrafts will mainly be responsible for the repair and assembly of agricultural machinery.

Compared with other provinces, Liaoning Province has many favorable conditions for realizing agricultural mechanization, modernization, and rural electrification. First, the foundation of local industry is good. Last year, the total output value of local industry was equivalent to 162.64% of the total value of agricultural and sideline production, and many agricultural machines can be manufactured. In terms of technical strength, in addition to a considerable number of technical personnel in local industry, it can also obtain assistance from state-owned industry and experts from brother countries. Secondly, after agricultural cooperation, the need for agricultural mechanization is very urgent. The characteristics of Liaoning are fertile land and a short frost-free period. Compared with the rural areas within the customs, there are fewer people and more land, resulting in a lack of labor and relatively rough cultivation. In this fertile land, with fewer people and more land, there is an urgent need to use agricultural machinery to replace manual labor. Again, in recent years, agricultural mechanization and rural electrification have some foundations. More than 20 tractor stations have been established throughout the province, and a number of mechanical and electrical irrigation stations and twenty small power stations have been built, accumulating some experience and training some technical backbones. In addition, the power grid and transportation network are spread throughout the province, which also facilitates the realization of agricultural mechanization.

    辽宁省运用有利条件改变农村面貌
    五年内奠定现代化农业基础
    80％耕地机械化半数以上乡电气化
    据新华社讯　辽宁省计划在第二个五年计划期间实现农业机械化现代化，机械化耕地面积要达到全省耕地面积80％以上；有50％—60％的乡实现电气化。这是中共辽宁省委15日召开的常委会决定的。
    辽宁省农业机械化现代化的主要方向是：在耕作、水利、农副业加工方面实现机械化；大量发展化学肥料、农药、兽药等的生产；大量建设农村小型发电站。
    辽宁省工业和农业部门为了完成这一艰巨的任务，首先将建立农业机械和化学肥料、农药等研究机构，调查研究农业机械化现代化建设的实际需要和农村购买力；广泛搜集农业机械化现代化的技术资料和图纸。在制订实现农业机械化现代化规划的同时，地方工业部门将协助试制和大量制造各种适用的机械产品。全省地方工业除了制造国家的计划产品以外，要全部承担小型机械和零星机具的生产任务，县工业和手工业主要是负责农业机械的修配工作。
    辽宁省实现农业机械化现代化和农村电气化，同其他省份比较，具有许多有利的条件。首先是地方工业的基础好，地方工业去年的生产总值相当于农副业生产总值的162.64％，许多农业机械都能制造。在技术力量方面，除地方工业有相当数量的技术人员以外，还可以得到国营工业和兄弟国家的专家的援助。其次农业合作化以后，农业机械化的需要十分迫切。辽宁的特点是土地肥沃，无霜期短，比起关内农村是人少地多，因而劳动力缺乏，耕作比较粗糙。在这种土地肥沃，人少地多的地区，迫切需要使用农业机械代替人力劳动。再次，几年来农业机械化、农村电气化已有一些基础，全省试办了二十多处拖拉机站，建设了一些机械和电力灌溉站，有二十个小型发电站，积累了一些经验，培养了一些技术骨干。此外，电力网、交通网遍布全省，也便于实现农业机械化。
