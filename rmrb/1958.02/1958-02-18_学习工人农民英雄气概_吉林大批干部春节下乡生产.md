Many will participate in labor production in agricultural cooperatives and spend the Spring Festival with the peasants.

The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to hold a provincial-wide broadcast conference on the day of the Spring Festival, calling on the people of the province to prepare for spring plowing, boost revolutionary spirit, and create favorable conditions for a great leap forward in production this year. At the provincial committee meeting held on the 16th, it was decided that secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and members of the Standing Committee would lead cadres in five groups to go deep into the rural areas during the Spring Festival; the secretary in charge of rural work had already left for Gongzhuling Prefecture on the 16th to convey and deploy the current tasks of the agricultural Great Leap Forward. Cadres of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee agencies expressed their desire to learn from the heroic spirit of workers and peasants, to not ask for leave or return home during the Spring Festival, to persist in their work, and to actively sign up to participate in labor production. In various units, workers and staff who were queuing to buy train tickets to go home a few days ago are now busy queuing to refund their tickets, and some workers who were planning to get married during the Spring Festival have also postponed their weddings to participate in labor.
