The production plans formulated by various regions and agricultural cooperatives this year are mostly Great Leap Forward plans with substantial production increases. To ensure the realization of these plans, we must first guarantee a bumper harvest of summer crops. Hebei Province recently put forward the fighting slogan "Fight fiercely for three months, launch the first shot, and strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops!" This is of great significance not only to Hebei Province but also to the whole country.

We know that summer crops (mainly wheat) occupy a pivotal position in agricultural production in the vast areas south of the Great Wall and north of the Huai River. Without a summer harvest, it would be impossible to complete the annual production plan by relying solely on the autumn harvest. Conversely, if there is a bumper harvest of summer crops, coupled with a bumper harvest of autumn crops, we can guarantee the completion of the annual plan. Even if some disasters are encountered in the autumn, life will be relatively better. This is regarding the North. In the southern provinces, summer crops should not be underestimated either. Although wheat production in the South is smaller than in the North, the commodity rate is higher. If wheat production increases significantly, the state can obtain more marketable grain, and farmers can also increase their income. Rapeseed, one of the summer crops, is mainly produced in the southern provinces, and this is of even greater significance for ensuring the completion of the state's oil production plan. Therefore, although summer harvesting is called "Small Spring" or "Small Season" in various parts of the South, it should never be underestimated.

The production of summer crops this year has unprecedentedly favorable conditions, namely, a substantial increase in water and fertilizer. Spring drought and fertilizer shortage have always been the biggest obstacles to achieving a bumper harvest of summer crops. Now, in many areas, this obstacle basically does not exist. We should take advantage of such favorable conditions, actively expand the spring irrigation area, apply more top dressing to crops, and strengthen other cultivation measures to ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops.

To fight this first battle well, there must be a strong command. What is urgently needed now is for leading Party and government organs at all levels to take the initiative into their own hands, seize the opportunity, take measures, organize forces, and take active actions to make field management very meticulous and strive for perfection. Hebei Province, from the province to the special zone, is organizing a large number of cadres headed by responsible cadres to go to various places for inspection, requiring them to go to every township, inspect every commune, classify and rank them, discover problems, solve problems, discover advanced elements, encourage advanced elements, and promote advanced experiences. This is very necessary. A massive mass movement to strengthen wheat field management is about to appear in the vast areas of Hebei Province.

This year, rural work cadres and township and commune cadres in various places are preparing to cultivate experimental fields. Now is the time for everyone to show their talents. The objective situation requires rural work comrades to hurry to agricultural cooperatives and production teams, first delineate the experimental fields for summer crops, and cultivate them conscientiously. As long as various localities can universally improve production leadership through the cultivation of experimental fields, the battle to strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops can be won.

    打好跃进的第一仗
    田喜盈
    今年各地区和各个农业合作社所制订的生产计划，多是大幅度增产的跃进计划。为了保证计划的实现，首先要保证夏收作物大丰收。河北省最近提出“鏖战三个月，打响第一炮，力争夏季作物大丰收！”的战斗口号，这不仅对河北省有重大意义，对全国也有重大意义。
    我们知道，夏收作物（主要是小麦）在长城以南、淮河以北的广大地区的农业生产中占有举足轻重的地位。没有夏季丰收，光靠秋季丰收，要完成全年生产计划是不可能的。反过来，如果夏季作物大丰收，加上秋季作物的丰收，就能保证完成全年计划。即使秋季遇到一些灾害，日子也比较好过。这是说的北方。在南方各省来说，夏收作物也不可轻视。南方小麦产量虽然比北方小，但是商品率大。如果小麦大量增产，就能使国家获得较多的商品粮，同时也能使农民增加收入。夏收作物中的油菜，主要是南方各省生产的，这一项对于保证国家油料生产计划的完成更有重要意义。所以，夏收在南方各地虽然被称为“小春”或“小季”，但是决不应当小看它。
    今年夏收作物的生产，具有空前有利的条件，就是水和肥料大大增加了。春旱和缺肥历来是争取夏收作物丰收的最大障碍。现在很多地区这种障碍基本上不存在了。我们应该利用这样的大好条件，积极扩大春季灌溉面积，更多地给庄稼追肥，并且加强其他培育措施，以保证夏收作物的大丰收。
    要打好这第一仗，不能没有坚强的指挥。现在迫切需要的是各级党政领导机关把致胜的主动权掌握到手里，抓紧时机，采取措施，组织力量，积极行动，把田间管理做得十分周详，精益求精。河北省从省到专区，正在以负责干部为首组织大批干部分赴各地检查，要求做到乡乡走到、社社检查、分类排队、发现问题、解决问题、发现先进、鼓励先进、推广先进经验，这是十分必要的。一个规模巨大的加强麦田管理的群众性运动，即将在河北省的广大地区出现。
    今年各地农村工作干部和乡、社干部都在准备种试验田，现在是大家大显身手的时候了。客观形势要求农村工作同志们赶快到农业社里去，到生产队里去，首先把夏收作物的试验田划定，并且认真地培育起来。只要各地能普遍通过种试验田切实改进了生产领导，争取夏收作物大丰收这一仗是能够打胜的。
