　　Dawn Farm in Heilongjiang Province suffered a loss of over 780,000 yuan in 1956 due to poor management, blind spending, and increased production costs. The People's Daily published an editorial in March 1957, "Reducing Production Costs of State-Owned Farms," which criticized the farm.

　　In 1957, Dawn Farm accepted the criticism from the Party newspaper, mobilized all employees to comprehensively review the work of 1956, and resolutely implemented the policy of running the farm diligently and frugally. As a result, under roughly the same conditions as the previous year, it obtained a profit of over 220,000 yuan.

　　Dawn Farm implemented the policy of running the farm diligently and frugally by starting with the formulation of carefully calculated plans and vigorously reducing various expenses. The farm headquarters first calculated the overall accounts, calculating income and expenses, and establishing income on a solid and reliable basis; focusing on reducing costs, especially reducing indirect production costs, so that costs were reduced from the planning stage. Based on this, it then determined the planned control indicators for each production team. Then, the farm director personally led the heads of agriculture, machinery, accounting, and supply departments to the Second Production Team to specifically assist in calculating detailed accounts and formulating plans. After they determined the output of each plot of land through field surveys, they concentrated their efforts on reducing costs. First, they calculated technical measures. At the beginning, there was a bias towards simply reducing costs without paying attention to ensuring increased production. For example, they did not want to use manure fertilizer because they were afraid of high costs. After correcting this bias, the costs reduced in technical measures were: (1) changing single operations to complex operations, generally reducing one plowing; (2) adopting sun-drying and seed treatment, increasing the seed germination rate from 85% to 90%. Second, they calculated material consumption. They mobilized employees to calculate in detail item by item in the spirit of living frugally with the old resources, reducing consumption to the minimum. Then, they thoroughly checked the inventory, and all surplus materials were frozen except for those needed to meet the plan formulated according to the detailed accounts. Third, they calculated the repair costs of agricultural machinery, calculating each tractor and each farm implement in detail, and determining them separately. Finally, they calculated the unit area cost and the cost per jin of grain, repeatedly calculating until the cost was lower than the target set by the farm headquarters.

　　After the leading cadres gained experience in the Second Production Team, they then went to each production team to assist in calculating detailed accounts and formulating plans in the same way. This kind of detailed accounting played a significant role in reducing costs, especially in material consumption and expense expenditure, which were greatly reduced. For example, in the material supply plan proposed by each production team before calculating the detailed accounts, they requested to purchase 10,000 sacks. After calculating the detailed accounts and checking the inventory, the production teams not only did not lack sacks, but also returned more than 1,000 to the farm headquarters. During the spring plowing period, they originally requested a supply of 19,000 yuan for miscellaneous production tool expenses, but after calculating the detailed accounts, it was reduced to 5,000 yuan. Agricultural machinery repair costs were also reduced by more than 30,000 yuan compared to the original plan. The plan formulated through this method reduced the unit area cost by 47% compared to 1956.

　　In order to mobilize the masses to strengthen farm management, the farm implemented a financial contract system based on calculating detailed accounts and formulating plans. The farm headquarters clearly defined the total cost expenditure and various production expenses, separated into major items, and contracted them to the production teams, requiring them to only reduce, not exceed. In order to rely on employees to implement the contract system, the production teams divided the land into several specialized responsibility areas, and contracted each area to various groups according to the output of each plot of land and the standards for labor and materials determined during the plan formulation, implementing the "three guarantees and one fixed" specialized responsibility system of guaranteeing output, guaranteeing work, guaranteeing materials, and fixing the area (fixed land). Production tools (low-value consumables) were handed over to the groups for self-management, those for personal use were handed over to individuals for safekeeping, and those for public use by the group were assigned to a designated person within the group for management. The amount of labor used for each plot of land and each operation was clearly defined, and the group controlled it, and was not allowed to exceed it. This gave management a broader mass base. The farm headquarters strictly controlled various expenditures according to the business system. For technical measures, unplanned ones must be reviewed by the agricultural technician, agreed to by the accounting office, and approved by the farm director before they could be carried out.

　　Due to the concerted efforts of the employees to save, material consumption was greatly reduced. For example, in the wheat harvest the previous year, the mats used to cover the grain were all mats costing more than four yuan each, while last year they were all grass curtains woven by the employees themselves; in the previous year, the loss and damage of various materials were countless, while last year there was no loss at all, so the amortization expenses for low-value consumables were reduced from more than 112,000 yuan to more than 25,000 yuan. In terms of machinery repair, the mechanical engineer uniformly controlled it, and repair vouchers with amounts were issued based on the amount of work completed by each vehicle, so the repair cost was reduced from more than 47,000 yuan to more than 19,000 yuan.

　　The farm also strengthened basic accounting work, which played a significant role in reducing downtime, idling, and improving labor efficiency.

　　Through the above series of work, the production cost in 1957 was greatly reduced. The cost per hectare of wheat was reduced from 258 yuan in 1956 to 160 yuan, and soybeans from 213 yuan to 143 yuan. Overall, calculated by unit area cost, it was reduced by more than 539,000 yuan compared to 1956, and more than 93,000 yuan compared to the plan.

　　The facts of Dawn Farm vividly illustrate that conscientiously implementing the policy of running the farm diligently and frugally is the fundamental key to running the farm well. The farm's transformation from serious losses to profitable production is a very clear contrast!

　　Although Dawn Farm has undergone fundamental changes in management, it still has many problems. For example, the management organization is large (non-production personnel account for 17% of the total number of employees), and excessive wages for redundant personnel and cadre training fees in non-production expenditures. If the above two items can be improved, costs can be reduced by more than 100,000 yuan. In addition, livestock production was not well done, losing more than 82,000 yuan. This shows that the farm still has great potential for reducing costs.

    曙光农场从亏损到盈余
    丁履枢
    黑龙江国营曙光农场，1956年由于经营管理不善，盲目花钱，生产成本增高，全年共亏损七十八万多元。人民日报在1957年3月发表“降低国营农场生产成本”的社论，曾对这个农场提出了批评。
    1957年，曙光农场接受党报批评，发动全场职工全面地检查了1956年的工作，坚决贯彻勤俭办场的方针，以致在和前年大致相同的情况下，获得了二十二万多元的利润。
    曙光农场贯彻勤俭办场方针是从制定精打细算的计划着手，大力削减各项费用。场部首先总起来算大帐，算收入，算支出，把收入建立在稳妥可靠的基础上；着重压缩成本，特别是削减间接生产费用，使成本从计划上降低下来。再据此确定每个生产队的计划控制指标。然后，场长亲自率领农业、机务、会计、供应等部门的负责人，深入到第二生产队，具体地协助算细帐，制定计划。他们通过查田定产按地块确定产量后，集中力量压低成本。首先算技术措施。开始时产生了单纯为降低成本不注意保证增产的偏向。例如怕成本高就不想使用粪肥了。纠正这一偏向后，在技术措施上压低的成本是：（1）改单独作业为复式作业，普遍减少了一遍耙地；（2）采取晒种和种子处理，把种子发芽率由85％提高到90％。其次是算物资消耗。发动职工本着利用旧家底过穷日子的精神，一项一项地细算，把消耗减少到最低限度。接着彻底清查家底，除根据算细帐制定的计划满足需要外，多余物资一律冻结。再次是算农机具修理费，按每台拖拉机、每台农具，一台一台的细算，分别定下来。最后总起来算单位面积成本和粮食每斤成本，反复的算，直到成本低于场部指标为止。
    领导干部在第二生产队摸好试点之后，然后分头深入各生产队，同样协助算细帐制定计划。这样算细帐，在降低成本上起到很大的作用，特别是在物资消耗和费用支出上，大大降低下来。例如各生产队算细帐以前提出的物资供应计划中，要求购买麻袋一万条，经过算细帐清查家底后，各个生产队的麻袋不但不缺，反而交回场部一千多条。春耕期间本来要求供应零星生产工具费一万九千元，算细帐后减为五千元。农机具修理费用也比原计划减少三万多元。通过这种方法制定的计划，使单位面积成本比1956年降低了47％。
    为了发动群众加强农场经营管理，该场在算细帐制定计划的基础上，实行了财务包干制度。场部把成本支出总额和各项生产费用，分开大项目，明确地定出来，分别包给生产队，要求只准降低，不准超过。生产队里为了依靠职工贯彻包干制度，把土地划分成若干个专责区，按制定计划时讨论确定的每块地的产量和用工、用物标准，分别包给各个小组，按小组实行包产、包工、包物和固定专区（固定土地）的“三包一固定”的专责制度。把生产工具（低值易耗品）分别交给小组自行管理，属于个人使用的交给个人保管，属于小组公用的，组内指定专人管理。对于每块地每项作业用工多少，都明确地定出来，由小组掌握，不准超过。这就使经营管理上具有了比较广泛的群众基础。场部则按业务系统严格控制各项支出。属于技术措施方面，计划外的必须报经农业技师审查、会计室同意，并经场长批准，方准进行。
    由于职工们一致努力节约，物质消耗大大减少。例如前年麦收时苫粮食全部是四元多一领的席子，去年全部是职工们自己割草编的草帘子；前年各项物资丢失损坏难以数计，去年则根本没有损失，因而使低值易耗品的摊消费用由十一万二千多元，降低为二万五千多元。机具修理方面，由机务工程师统一控制，根据每台机车完成的工作量，发给带金额的修理券，因而修理费用由四万七千多元降低为一万九千多元。
    这个农场还加强了基层核算工作，这在减少停工、窝工，提高劳动效率上起到很大的作用。
    通过上述一系列的工作，1957年的生产成本大大降低下来了。小麦每公顷成本由1956年的二百五十八元降低为一百六十元，大豆由二百十三元降低为一百四十三元。总起来按单位面积成本计算比1956年降低了五十三万九千多元，比计划降低了九万三千多元。
    曙光农场的事实，生动地说明，认真贯彻勤俭办场方针，是办好农场的根本关键。这个农场从严重亏损变为生产有利润，是十分鲜明的对比！
    曙光农场在经营管理上虽然已经发生了根本的变化，可是他们还存在不少问题。例如管理机构庞大（非生产人员占职工总数的17％），以及非生产支出中编余人员工资和干部培养费过多等。以上二项如能加以改进，就可以降低成本十万元以上。另外，畜牧生产搞得不好，赔了八万二千多元。由此可以看出这个农场在降低成本上还有巨大的潜力。
