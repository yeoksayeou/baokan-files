By organizing production balance according to advanced links, Chongqing Steel Company has formulated a Great Leap Forward plan.

(This newspaper reports) According to the Sichuan Daily: Should we display heroic spirit and overcome difficulties by all means, or should we seek comfort and follow a gradual approach? When the Chongqing Steel Company Party Committee reviewed this year's production plan, after ideological exchanges and unifying the understanding of cadres, it transformed the original passive balance plan that looked to the backward links into an active balance plan that overcame the backward links and fully utilized the potential of equipment.

The characteristic of Chongqing Steel Company's production this year is that the steel rolling capacity is greater than steelmaking, and steelmaking is greater than ironmaking. When compiling this year's plan, the original plan was to balance the steelmaking and steel rolling production plans according to the ironmaking capacity, which was the lowest in production capacity. Despite the two revisions made to the plan under the new situation, the increase in production has not been significant due to this passive balance thinking.

In mid-January, when the Party Committee reviewed this plan, it found that the steel rolling operation rate was very low, and had not even reached the actual level of the fourth quarter of 1957. The Party Committee believed that this production plan, which was balanced according to backward links, could not inspire the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and play a guiding role in production. It was decided to bring it to the ongoing three-level cadre meeting for discussion: Should we arouse enthusiasm, show our abilities, and try every means to increase steel production to meet the needs of steel rolling; or should we be content with the status quo, look to the backward links, and easily complete the tasks? At the meeting, some cadres mistakenly viewed the experiences and lessons of 1956, fearing difficulties, fearing tension, and wanting to live a comfortable life; on the pretext of stability, they even held the attitude of "keeping a hand" by setting the plan lower and preferring to overfulfill it more. These erroneous thoughts were severely criticized. The meeting also pointed out that the so-called most difficult problem of pig iron supply was not unsolvable. This boosted the confidence and vigor of the cadres to overcome difficulties, and it was decided to overturn the original passive balance plan, actively balance according to the needs of steel rolling, and revise the plan for the third time.

On January 21, the company held an advanced producers conference to discuss this plan. During the discussion, advanced producers from various workshops and departments repeatedly studied the plan by comparing advanced experiences, carefully calculating accounts, and tapping potential, and believed that the original plan could be further improved. The ironmaking workshop proposed that after the overhaul of the blast furnace in the fourth quarter of this year, the volume could be increased by 30 cubic meters. They and the machine repair department decided to put the overhaul project into production one quarter earlier, which could produce dozens of tons of iron more per day. The company's engineering and technical personnel are also preparing to go to small factories to help local small ironmaking plants improve their technology and increase pig iron production. In terms of steelmaking: the small steelmaking workshop decided to adopt the double-tap method to increase furnace output. This alone can produce 20,000 tons of steel more this year. The large steelmaking workshop decided to be the first in the country to promote the Soviet Union's latest technological achievement – aluminum-magnesium brick furnace roof, which would extend the furnace life to at least 300 to 350 furnaces, and produce about 20,000 tons of steel more per year. The meeting also pointed out that the consumption potential of raw materials, especially metal materials, is very large. They compared the level of advanced factories, such as the transportation and storage loss rate of pig iron in advanced factories, which is only 1%, while the company's actual rate is 2.5%. They believe that it is entirely possible to reduce it to 1.5% this year. In addition, we can also vigorously tap the potential of utilizing scrap steel. As a result of the discussion, the original plan was broken through again: the company's total output value increased by 8.5% over last year (the original plan was less than 5%); steel increased by 17.86% (the original plan was less than 10%); steel材 increased by 11.71% (the original plan was 5%); the cost was reduced from the original 3.6% to 7.2%; and the annual profit that can be turned over can reach 27 million yuan.

### 按照先进环节组织生产平衡  重庆钢铁公司订出大跃进计划

    按照先进环节组织生产平衡
    重庆钢铁公司订出大跃进计划
    本报讯　据四川日报报道：是拿出英雄气概、千方百计克服困难，还是贪图松快、因循渐进？重庆钢铁公司党委在审查今年生产计划时，经过思想交锋，统一干部认识以后，把原来向落后环节看齐的消极平衡计划，一变而为克服落后环节、充分发挥设备潜力的积极平衡计划。
    重庆钢铁公司今年生产的特点，是轧钢能力大于炼钢，炼钢又大于炼铁。在编制今年计划时，原来是按生产能力最低的炼铁来平衡制订炼钢和轧钢生产计划。尽管在新的形势下，计划曾作了两次修改，但是由于这种消极平衡的思想作怪，增产始终不大。
    1月中旬，党委在审查这一计划时，发现轧钢作业率很低，还没有达到1957年四季度的实际水平。党委认为，这种按落后环节来平衡的生产计划，不能鼓起群众革命干劲，起到指导生产的作用。决定将它拿到正在召开的三级干部会上加以讨论：究竟是鼓起干劲，拿出本事，想方设法增产钢铁，满足轧钢需要；还是安于现状，向落后环节看齐，轻轻松松完成任务？会上，部分干部错误看待1956年的经验教训，害怕困难，害怕紧张，想过轻松日子；借口要稳，甚至抱着计划订低点，宁可多超额的“留一手”的态度。这些错误的思想受到了严厉的批判。会议同时指出，所谓最困难的生铁供应问题，也不是不能解决的。这样，便鼓舞了干部克服困难的信心和朝气，决定推翻原来的消极平衡计划，按照轧钢需要，积极平衡，三度修订了计划。
    1月21日，公司召开先进生产者大会，对这个计划展开了讨论。在讨论中，各车间和科室的先进生产者以比先进、算细账、挖潜力的办法，反复研究，认为原计划还可以再提高一步。炼铁车间提出：原订今年四季度高炉大修后，容积可加大三十立方公尺，他们和机修部门决定把大修工程提前一季度投入生产，每天就可以多产几十吨铁。公司工程技术人员还准备下小厂帮助地方小炼铁厂提高技术，增产生铁。在炼钢方面：小型炼钢车间决定采取双槽出钢法，提高炉产量。仅此一项，今年就可以多出二万吨钢。大型炼钢车间决定在全国首先推行苏联最新的技术成就——铝镁砖炉顶，炉龄至少延长到三百至三百五十炉，一年就可以多产钢约两万吨。会上还提出原材料，特别是金属料的消耗潜力很大。他们比较了先进厂的水平，如先进厂生铁的运输和保管损耗率，只有1％，而公司实际是2.5％，他们认为今年降到1.5％，完全有把握。另外，还可以大力挖掘利用废钢铁的潜力。讨论结果，原计划又被突破：全公司总产值比去年增长8.5％（原计划不到5％）；钢增长17.86％（原计划不到10％）；钢材增长11.71％（原计划5％）；成本由原来降低3.6％，改为降低到7.2％；全年上缴利润可以达到二千七百万元。
