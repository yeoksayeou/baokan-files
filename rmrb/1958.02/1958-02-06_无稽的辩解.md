　　Absurd Excuses
　　British Acting Prime Minister Butler is still making excuses for American planes carrying hydrogen bombs flying over British airspace. He first said that American planes "will never accidentally trigger bombs."

　　Butler obviously knew that such a guarantee was hardly convincing, so he retreated and said that even if an explosion were triggered, "the risk of radioactivity" would be "very small."

　　Butler also knew that such a guarantee was hardly convincing. So he retreated again and said that even if there was a risk of radioactivity, "the pollution suffered by the ground" would be "limited to the vicinity of the crash site..."

　　According to Butler, it seems that the destructive power of hydrogen bombs is not as great as that of ordinary bombs. This remark by the British Acting Prime Minister shows how absurd lies the bourgeois rulers will tell to the people in order to cover up their actions of selling out national interests.

### 无稽的辩解

　　无稽的辩解
    英国代理首相巴特勒还在为载氢弹的美国飞机在英国上空飞行辩解。他先说美国飞机“决不会发生意外地引发炸弹的事件”。
    巴特勒显然知道这样的保票是很难令人信服的，于是他又退一步说，万一引起了爆炸，“发生的放射性的危险”“也是很小的”。
    巴特勒同样知道，这样的保票也是很难令人信服的。于是他又退一步说，万一发生了放射性的危险，“地面所遭受的污染”“也是限于飞机失事地点的附近……”。
    照巴特勒的说法，仿佛氢弹对于人的伤害力量还不如普通炸弹。英国代理首相的这一席话表明，资产阶级统治者为了掩饰自己出卖民族利益的行为，会在人民面前说出多么无稽的谎话。
