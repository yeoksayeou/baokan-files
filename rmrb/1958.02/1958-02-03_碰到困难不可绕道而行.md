Meeting Difficulties: Do Not Detour
　　Song Fangzhu

Those who believe in demons and fear ghosts tremble at the mention of them; those who are timid and afraid of difficulties sigh deeply at the mention of difficulties. But revolutionary and construction workers who are brave and progressive prefer to deal with difficulties, not only are not afraid of them, but also regard overcoming difficulties after a hard struggle as a pleasant and exhilarating experience.

Difficulties do force us to do many things that are both hard and troublesome, but they also teach us many valuable things. "Many people, little land, poor soil quality" used to be the biggest difficulty for agricultural cooperatives in Chenghai County, Guangdong Province, in developing production. But after this cooperative implemented the "intercropping and rotation system," one mu of land could yield three, four, five, or even six crops a year. The cooperative's multiple cropping index increased from 200% in 1955 to 289%, production advanced by leaps and bounds, and the income of cooperative members increased significantly.

Regarding difficulties, the Party Secretary of Fengjiao Township also has a profound summary: "Difficulties arise from intercropping and are solved by intercropping." That's right. Contrary to the difficulties of all dying reactionary classes, our difficulties are inherently difficulties in advancement and difficulties in development. Accompanying difficulties are precisely the huge potential for overcoming them. Therefore, slightly extending the words of the Township Party Secretary above leads to a judgment of universal significance: "Many of our difficulties arise from development and are also solved by development." It is often the case that when maintaining the status quo, difficulties do not seem to be so many or so prominent; but once a major undertaking is to be carried out, all kinds of practical difficulties arise. But there is no need to be afraid of this. As long as the method is correct, just go ahead and do it boldly; in the process of doing it, difficulties can be gradually overcome. After hitting the nail on the head and breaking a key difficulty, other minor difficulties will also be easily solved, achieving the effect of killing two birds with one stone or several birds with one stone. It's like fighting a battle, because the main attack direction is chosen accurately, and after crushing the enemy's army on the main front at once, the enemy's army on other fronts will also collapse. After Fengjiao Cooperative implemented the "intercropping and rotation system," not only did agricultural output greatly increase, but also the breeding industry, which could not be developed in the past due to the increase in feed crops, also developed; due to the breeding of poultry and livestock, the fertilizer that was originally extremely lacking was also sufficient; due to the implementation of intercropping and rotation, the original poor soil was also improved. In summary: the breakthrough of a major difficulty (implementing the "intercropping and rotation system" to fully improve land utilization and overcome the difficulty of many people and little land) triggered a "chain reaction" of enthusiasm. If they had not resolutely started a major undertaking at the beginning, where would there be such a good situation!

To break the situation, some difficulties have to be overcome. Then, is it really peaceful and uneventful to maintain the status quo? Definitely not. If Fengjiao Agricultural Cooperative does not implement the "intercropping and rotation system" and does not overcome the difficulties of "many people, little land, and poor soil quality," production will stagnate, and as a result, greater difficulties will come to the door and weigh on the head, which would be terrible!

Some people, when comparing the two contradictory aspects of difficulties and favorable conditions, often look at problems statically and in isolation. They only see the ready-made favorable conditions in front of them, but they do not see the favorable conditions that may be produced and are being produced. In fact, overcoming a certain key difficulty will also create favorable conditions for overcoming another one or several difficulties.

This inspires us: even if there are piles of difficulties, there is no need to be afraid, let alone detour, and adopt an attitude of "respecting gods and staying away" from difficulties. The more you delve into difficulties, the more you can get to the bottom of them, and the more you can enhance your confidence and strategies in overcoming them.

### 碰到困难不可绕道而行

　　碰到困难不可绕道而行
　　宋方渚
    信妖怕鬼的人，提起妖鬼就两股战栗；胆小怕困难的人，提起困难就长吁短叹。可是勇于进取的革命者和建设者，偏喜欢跟困难打交道，不但不怕它，而且把经过一番苦斗而战胜困难看做是一件心旷神怡的快事。
    困难固然逼着我们去做很多既辛苦又麻烦的事情，可是它也教给了我们好多宝贵的东西。“人多地少，土质不良”，曾经是广东澄海县农业社发展生产的最大困难。但当这个社实行了“间种轮作制”之后一亩地一年能收三次、四次、五次以至六次，全社复种指数由1955年的200％提高到289％，生产大踏步前进了，社员收入大量增加了。
    关于困难，凤窖乡党委书记还有一句意味深长的概括：“困难因间种产生，又因间种解决了。”对极了。同一切垂死的反动阶级的困难相反，我们的困难，本来就是前进中的困难，发展中的困难。伴随困难一起存在的，正是克服困难的巨大潜力。所以，把上面这位乡党委书记的话稍微引伸一下，就成为这样一个有普遍意义的判断：“我们的许多困难都因发展而产生，也因发展而解决。”事情常常是这样：维持现状的时候，好像困难还不怎么多，也不怎么突出；一当要大干特干一椿事业的时候，什么实际困难都来了。但是这也不必害怕。只要干法对头，就只管去大胆地干；在干的过程中，一个个困难都可以逐步克服。在击中要害地打破了一个关键性的困难之后，其他次要的困难也随着迎刃而解，可奏一箭双雕或一箭数雕之功。好像作战一样，由于主攻方向选得准，把主要战线的敌军一下子粉碎以后，其他战线上的敌军也望风披靡。凤窖社实行了“间种轮作制”之后，不但农业产量大大增加，由于饲料作物的增产，过去没法发展的饲养业也发展起来；由于家禽牲畜的繁殖，当初极感缺乏的肥料也够用了；由于实行间种轮作，原先不良的土壤也得以改良。总起来说就是：一个大困难的突破（实行“间种轮作制”，充分提高土地利用率，克服人多地少的困难），引起了积极性的“连锁反应”。假使当初他们不坚决大干起来，哪里会有这样好的局面呢！
    要打破局面，就得克服一些困难。那么，维持现状，是不是就真的太平无事了呢？决不是的。凤窖农业社倘若不实行“间种轮作制”，不克服“人多地少、土质不良”的困难，生产就会停滞不前，结果，更大的困难就会找上门来，压到头上，那就很糟糕了！
    有些人在比较困难和有利条件这两个矛盾侧面的时候，常常静止地、孤立地看问题。他们只看到摆在面前的现成的有利条件，却看不见可能产生和正在产生的有利条件。其实某一个关键性的困难的克服，同时也就会为克服另外一个或几个困难造成有利条件。
    这就启示我们：哪怕困难成堆，也用不着害怕，更不可绕道而行，对困难采取“敬鬼神而远之”的态度。越是钻到困难中去，就越能多摸到困难的底，越能增强战胜困难的信心和计策。
