    Honorable Comrade Zhou Enlai!
    Esteemed Delegates!
    Comrades and Friends!

    Today, we are infinitely honored to welcome the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China, which is currently paying a friendly visit to our country, at the Second Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    In the name of all the delegates of the Supreme People's Assembly, I would like to extend a warm welcome to all the comrades of the delegation headed by our distinguished guest, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the great Chinese people have achieved tremendous accomplishments in the solemn struggle of socialist construction.

    Socialism has achieved a decisive victory in the cities and rural areas of China, and the material and cultural living standards of the people have also improved significantly.

    The People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, which has made a great contribution to peace and security in the Far East and the world, and its international prestige has also been significantly enhanced.

    All the achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people in the struggle for building socialism and striving for peace have greatly encouraged our struggle for the peaceful reunification of our fatherland and the construction of socialism.

    The traditional friendship and unity between the people of our two countries has developed into an unbreakable force in the common struggle for peace and socialism.

    The Chinese people have consistently assisted us during the Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people and in the post-war period, and have made every effort to safeguard peace in Korea and promote the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    In its statement issued on February 7th, the Government of the People's Republic of China expressed its strong support for and agreement with the peaceful proposals put forward by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its statement issued on February 5th regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    In the Joint Statement signed today by the delegations of the two governments, the Government of the People's Republic of China once again stated its unwavering position to continue to make sincere efforts to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    Together with all the Korean people, we fully support and warmly welcome all the measures taken by the People's Republic of China this time for the peaceful settlement of the Korea issue. The Korean people are proud to have such close friends as the fraternal Chinese people in their struggle for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland and the construction of socialism.

    The Korean people consider the friendship and unity between our two countries to be invaluable, and will continue to make every effort to consolidate and develop this friendship and unity.

    I am convinced that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to our country will make a great contribution to further strengthening the fraternal friendship and unity between the people of the two countries and to the cause of safeguarding peace.

    Please allow me to respectfully invite Comrade Zhou Enlai, head of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China, to speak.
