　　Xiao Zhao, a salesperson in the clothing department of the Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing, is known for being astute and capable. He can handle the crowds even when customers are packed three or four deep. However, he always receives customer complaints, which Xiao Zhao has never understood.

　　Around three in the afternoon, when things are relatively quiet, Xiao Zhao usually takes the opportunity to sort out fabric coupons. He had just picked up the coupons when a customer approached.

　　“Comrade, show me a tunic suit.”

　　Salesperson Xiao Zhao assessed the customer’s build—neither fat nor thin, and of average height. He estimated that a size seven navy blue gabardine tunic would fit perfectly, and he grabbed one. The customer tried it on, and it did indeed fit well. However, the customer said, “Let me see a size eight.”

　　The customer put on the size eight tunic and asked Xiao Zhao, “How does it look?” Xiao Zhao saw that the sleeves and length were much too long, and he said, “Too big.” He added, “You can’t go wrong if you listen to me!” The customer then asked to try a size six, but Xiao Zhao said, “Size six is too small; you won’t be able to wear it. You can’t go wrong if you listen to me.”

　　The customer became a bit annoyed and blurted out, “I can’t listen to you entirely; I can only listen to you 60%.”

　　Xiao Zhao was filled with anger upon hearing this, thinking: I sincerely want you to buy a suitable piece of clothing, but you only listen to me 60%. This is outrageous! Fine, if you want a size six, I’ll give you a size six—suit yourself. He casually tossed out a size six tunic. The customer took it, tried it on, and asked Xiao Zhao, “How is it?”

　　“Do as you see fit!” Xiao Zhao replied angrily.

　　Upon hearing this, the customer became enraged:

　　“What kind of service attitude is this?!”

　　Xiao Zhao’s temper flared up as well, and he retorted without backing down, “You brought it on yourself!”

　　The customer said angrily, “Did I spend money to look for trouble?”

　　Xiao Zhao replied, “Ask yourself!”

　　At this point, the customer no longer wanted to choose a tunic. He looked at Xiao Zhao’s service number and turned towards the suggestion box.

　　Xiao Zhao was criticized by his comrades at the team meeting for this incident. Xiao Zhao felt wronged. He thought: Customers buy things with money, and we sell goods for money; neither of us needs to be polite. It's not that I don't want customers to buy suitable clothes. Every time a customer approaches the counter, I’ve already sized up their height and weight. As soon as the customer says what kind of clothing they want to buy, I pull out a piece, and it’s guaranteed to fit. But customers just don’t listen to me; it’s really difficult. He thought about it and couldn't figure it out, feeling troubled all night.

　　The next day was Xiao Zhao’s day off. He rode his bike home early in the morning. His home was in Haidian. Just as he was nearing his doorstep, he remembered that he hadn’t bought any gifts for his children. So, he went to the supply and marketing cooperative in town.

　　Xiao Zhao stood in front of the candy counter and took out his money.

　　“I want to buy thirty cents worth of candy.”

　　The salesperson weighed out three-plus ounces of pineapple candy for Xiao Zhao and walked away.

　　Because the candy pieces were large, three ounces only amounted to six or seven pieces. Xiao Zhao thought for a moment and made a request to the salesperson:

　　“Comrade, could you please change it for me?”

　　“This kind of candy is good; it’s delicious. Don’t change it,” the salesperson replied without looking up.

　　Xiao Zhao was already in a bad mood, and he happened to encounter an unenthusiastic and uncooperative salesperson here. He suppressed his anger and requested again:

　　“Change it for a greater variety.”

　　The salesperson replied absentmindedly:

　　“Thirty cents won’t buy everything.”

　　These words triggered Xiao Zhao’s temper, and he shouted, “What kind of service attitude is this? Is this how you treat customers? Are you acting like a salesperson?”

　　Seeing Xiao Zhao’s outburst, the salesperson immediately asked, “Which kind do you want to change it to?”

　　But Xiao Zhao angrily turned around and walked out the door, muttering, “What bad luck, spending money on candy only to get a stomach full of anger.”

　　At that moment, he suddenly remembered what the customer had said to him yesterday, “Spending money to look for trouble,” which made a lot of sense.

　　As he pushed his bicycle, he thought about all the times he had argued with customers. He lowered his head and pushed his bicycle forward, thinking about it all the way. The more he thought about it, the more he hated himself. Why did he have to argue with customers? If everyone could put themselves in each other’s shoes, wouldn’t things be fine?

    顶嘴
    北京王府井百货商店　孙一津
    服装部的售货员小赵，人人都说他精明能干。在顾客挤得三层四层的时候，他都能应付过来。可是他总少不了收到顾客的批评意见。这一点小赵一直想不通。
    午后三点多钟，比较清闲，小赵总是在这个时间里抽空清理布票。这次刚刚拿起布票，迎面来了一位顾客。
    “同志，拿件制服上衣给我看看。”
    售货员小赵一看这位顾客的身材，不胖不瘦，个头不低，他估量穿七号甲蓝华达呢上衣准合适，伸手拿出一件。顾客穿在身上也的确很合适。但是，顾客说：“拿八号的看看。”
    顾客穿上了八号的上衣，就问小赵：“你看怎样？”小赵一看，袖子和身长都长着一大块，就说：“太大。”又说：“你听我的没有错！”顾客又要求试试六号的，小赵说：“六号的太小，您穿不得。您听我的没有错。”
    顾客有些生气了，脱口说：“不能全听你的，只能听你60％。”
    小赵一听，满肚子是气，心里想：我实心实意地想让你买件合适的衣服，你反而只听我60％，真是岂有此理。好吧，你要六号的我就给你六号的，随你便吧。随手扔出一件六号上衣。顾客拿过来一试，问小赵：“怎样？”
    “你瞧着办吧！”小赵气呼呼地答道。
    顾客一听，就发了火：
    “你这是什么服务态度？！”
    小赵的火性子也上来了，不甘示弱抢白道：“这是你自己找的！”
    顾客气愤地说：“我花钱找别扭来啦？”
    小赵又回了一句：“问你自己吧！”
    这时，顾客不再想挑上衣了，看了看小赵的服务号码，扭头向意见箱走去。
    为这件事小赵在小组会上，受到了同志们的批评。小赵感到委屈。他想：顾客凭钱买东西，我们凭货卖钱，谁也用不着客气。我也不是不愿意顾客买到合适的衣服呀。每当顾客走近柜台的时候，我就已经打量好他的高矮胖瘦，只要顾客一说买什么服装，我拿出一件，准保合适。可顾客偏偏不听我的话，实在难办。想来想去想不通，别扭了一夜。
    第二天该着小赵休假，一早便骑车回家。他家住在海淀。快到家门口的时候，才想起来没有给孩子买点礼物。于是来到镇上的供销合作社里。
    小赵站在糖果柜台前面，掏出钱来。
    “我买三角钱的糖。”
    营业员称了三两多菠萝糖给了小赵，便走开了。
    因为糖块很大，所以三两也才只有六、七块。小赵想了想，向营业员提出一个要求：
    “同志，你给我换一换吧！”
    “这种糖不坏，好吃，别换了。”营业员没抬头答道。
    小赵本来心里就不痛快，偏偏在这里又遇上了一个不热情不顺心的营业员，他压住火儿又一次要求道：
    “换一换样数多一些。”
    营业员又漫不经心的答道：
    “你三角钱买不全。”
    这句话可把小赵的火性子触发了，他喊道：“你这是什么服务态度？你就这样对待顾客吗？你像一个营业员吗？”
    营业员见小赵这样暴躁，立刻问道：“你换那种？”
    可是小赵气呼呼地扭身走出门口，嘴里嘟囔着：“真倒霉，花钱买糖惹了一肚子气。”
    这时，他猛然想起昨天那位顾客对他说的“花钱找别扭”，真是有道理。
    他推着自行车边走边想，一桩桩的与顾客顶嘴的往事都涌现出来，他低着头，推着自行车只管往前走。越想越痛恨自己，干嘛要同顾客顶嘴呢？大家都能设身处地想一想，事情不就完了吗？
