    Zhejiang Province Sets Specific Tasks:
    Treat 800,000 Schistosomiasis Patients This Year
    Basically Eliminate Snails in One-Half of the Areas
    (This newspaper reports) According to the Zhejiang Daily: Following the spirit of the Fourth National Conference on Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control, Zhejiang Province has put forward specific tasks for accelerating the elimination of schistosomiasis this year, striving to ensure that one-half of the province's patients, approximately 800,000 people, receive treatment.
    On the 17th, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee convened a meeting of the heads of the Health Department, Agriculture Department, Water Conservancy Department, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Zhejiang Provincial Women's Federation, the Hangzhou Municipal People's Committee, and other units to examine and study the province's work in eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating schistosomiasis. The meeting believed that, based on the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee's plan to eliminate schistosomiasis within three years, the specific tasks for the people of Zhejiang Province this year are: Shaoxing City, Jinhua City, and Deqing County, which have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, must continue to strengthen comprehensive measures for schistosomiasis prevention and control to consolidate their achievements; the fifty-one counties with prevalent schistosomiasis are required to treat one-half of their patients, approximately 800,000 people, among which Hangzhou City, Jiaxing City, Huzhou City, and the sixteen counties with fewer than 10,000 patients must basically eliminate schistosomiasis, and the seven counties with more patients—Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Haining, Jinhua, Qu County, and Changshan—must treat 60% of their patients. At the same time, it is essential to basically eliminate snails in approximately one-half of the snail-infested areas of the province.
    In order to accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis and other parasitic diseases, the meeting believed that it is necessary to implement a policy of active prevention and control, and to take comprehensive prevention and control measures. Environmental and personal hygiene must be improved, and fecal management work must be done universally throughout the province, promoting the separation of humans and livestock and separate water use for different ponds. The water conservancy departments should combine water conservancy construction activities to eliminate snails. The agricultural departments should mobilize the masses to do a good job in fecal management during the fertilizer accumulation campaign. The health departments must conscientiously implement the mass line work method, delivering schistosomiasis treatment to people's doorsteps, and continue to study oral antimony preparations for treatment, vigorously promoting them at the appropriate time, while strengthening technical guidance on snail elimination and fecal management.
