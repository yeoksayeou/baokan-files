Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: According to preliminary statistics up to the beginning of February, the number of cadres transferred to lower levels for labor training and to work in grassroots units has reached 1.3 million nationwide.

This is a new leap forward in our cadre work. These transferred cadres are actively participating in the socialist construction of the motherland with vigorous energy. After several months of labor and grassroots work, many white-faced scholars who could not lift with their shoulders or carry with their hands have learned some agricultural techniques and have become accustomed to the arduous physical labor and frugal life of the countryside. In particular, many have changed from looking down on labor to loving labor, and from looking down on working people to loving working people. They believe that there is much to be done in the countryside and have begun to change from the bottom of their hearts the erroneous view that intellectuals going to the countryside is a "waste of talent." While actively engaging in physical labor, many transferred cadres also bring technology and culture to the countryside. They help peasants run spare-time middle schools and primary schools, working during the day and teaching at night. Some help working people carry out recreational activities, and some provide agricultural technical guidance. These activities have been greatly welcomed by the peasants.

Managing the cadres who have been transferred well with a spirit of taking full responsibility and strengthening the ideological education of the transferred cadres is an extremely important issue at present. Shaanxi Province stipulates that leading Party and government cadres at the county or factory and mine level are responsible for regularly guiding the political life and study of transferred cadres and reporting to higher authorities regularly. The original units should contact the transferred cadres once every three months and conduct a comprehensive review once a year. The labor, life, and study performance of the transferred cadres should be evaluated once a year by the masses of the agricultural cooperative, production team, or workshop where they are located. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulates that county and township Party committees and the original units must assign special personnel to manage the transferred cadres, and promptly understand and solve the problems of the transferred cadres in terms of ideology, production, study, welfare, rewards and punishments. In addition, some places regularly hold forums for transferred cadres at the district and township level to solve their various practical problems, which has also been very effective. Many places also use methods such as leaders visiting transferred cadres and transferred cadres sending representatives to report to the original organs to strengthen ideological education.

    全国下放干部一百三十万
    今后要以负责到底精神加强对下放干部的思想教育工作
    据新华社23日讯　到2月上旬的初步统计，全国下放劳动锻炼和下放到基层单位工作的干部已经达到一百三十万人。
    这是我国干部工作上的一个新的跃进。这些下放干部以生龙活虎的姿态，积极参加祖国的社会主义建设事业。经过几个月的劳动和基层工作的锻炼，许多肩不能挑手不能提的白面书生，已经学会了一些农业技术，习惯于农村艰苦的体力劳动和俭朴的生活；特别是许多人由轻视劳动，开始变为热爱劳动，由轻视劳动人民，开始变为热爱劳动人民，认为在农村大有可为，开始从心底里改变那种所谓知识分子下乡是“大材小用”的错误看法。在积极从事体力劳动的同时，许多下放干部还把技术和文化带到农村。他们帮助农民办业余中学和小学，白天劳动，晚上教学。有的帮助劳动人民开展文娱活动，有的进行农业技术指导，这些事情都受到农民很大的欢迎。
    以负责到底的精神管理好已经下放的干部，加强对下放干部的思想教育工作，是当前一个极为重要的问题。陕西省规定：县或厂矿党政领导干部负责经常指导下放干部的政治生活和学习，定期向上级汇报；原单位每隔三个月同下放干部联系一次，一年进行一次全面考察；下放干部的劳动、生活和学习表现，由所在的农业社、生产队或车间群众每年评比一次。中共湖南省委规定：县、乡党委和原单位必须设专人管理下放干部，及时了解和解决下放干部的思想、生产、学习、生活福利和奖惩等方面的问题。此外，有的地方以区乡为单位定期召开下放干部座谈会，解决他们的各种实际问题，收效也很好。许多地方还运用领导人探望下放干部、下放干部派代表向原机关汇报等方式，来加强思想教育工作。
