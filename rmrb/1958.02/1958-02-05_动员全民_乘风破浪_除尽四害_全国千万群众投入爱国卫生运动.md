　　Mobilize the Whole Nation, Bravely Forge Ahead, Eliminate the Four Pests
    Tens of Millions of People Across the Country Join the Patriotic Health Campaign
    This newspaper reports: Since the beginning of winter, from cities to vast rural areas, from plains to mountains, countless masses of people have launched into a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests with an overwhelming and surging force, achieving brilliant victories and bringing forth countless "Four-No" towns, townships, communes, streets, and units. Currently, this movement has entered a climax in many regions.
    Major cities have successively launched campaigns to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. From the end of last year to the end of January this year, Beijing launched three battles to eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies in urban areas and to catch rats and eliminate sparrows. More than one million people participated in the "Eliminate the Four Pests, Promote Hygiene" grand competition, and more than 1,277,000 rats and sparrows have been eliminated in urban and suburban areas. According to statistics from six districts, 446 agencies, factories, schools, troops, stores, and other units have achieved "Four-No" status. In the past month or so, more than four million people in Shanghai have participated in this patriotic health blitz. Cities such as Nanjing, Guangzhou, Changchun, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chongqing, Wuhan, and Tianjin have also mobilized the broad masses and achieved great results.
    Since the beginning of winter, the vast rural areas and small and medium-sized cities in many provinces across the country have also vigorously launched patriotic health campaigns centered on eliminating the four pests. In Shanxi Province, 34 cities and counties have involved more than 4 million people in this movement. About 80% of the province's youth are involved in the movement. In the past, some high mountain and deep ravine areas with sparse populations had relatively backward sanitation conditions, but now their sanitation appearance has undergone tremendous changes. Currently, the province has 269 basically "Four-No" villages, and the number of generally clean and sanitary villages has leaped from 320 before October last year to 940. The movement has basically been fully launched in all counties and cities in Jiangsu Province. According to statistics from mid-December last year, more than 3,860 rat-free, fly-free, mosquito-free, and sparrow-free villages and residential areas have emerged across the province. Many counties and cities in other provinces have also launched campaigns to eliminate the four pests, and many "Four-No" units have emerged.
    The patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, which is being carried out nationwide this year, has the following characteristics:
    First, party and government leaders at many provincial, municipal, and county levels attach great importance to this movement. Party and government leaders in Shanghai have changed the past practice of holding meetings at all levels to mobilize and deploy work and have instead directly led and deployed the movement by responsible persons from party and government agencies, and personally led the broad masses of cadres and people to participate in the movement, which has rapidly set off a climax. Many leading cadres such as the Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee and the Mayor of Nanjing swept the streets and eliminated mosquitoes and flies together with the masses. Responsible party and government officials in many other provinces and cities have also personally taken charge of leading the movement and conducted timely inspections, thus enabling the movement to be sustained.
    Second, the scale and scope of this movement are unprecedented in past health campaigns. Many provinces, cities, and counties have mobilized thousands of people to participate in the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests. Large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai and many counties and cities in various provinces have achieved "household knowledge" and "household mobilization, everyone starts." During the movement, countless activists in eliminating the four pests emerged in various places. Health models and activists in eliminating the four pests have played a leading role in this movement. In addition to introducing their experience in eliminating the four pests to the masses, health models and activists in eliminating the four pests in Nanjing have also led the surrounding masses to actively participate in the patriotic health movement. Lu Dama, a national model of hygiene, took the lead in leading residents in a general cleaning. Zhu Zhaoyi, a cook at the Anhui Administrative College, used a homemade gun to kill sparrows. After painstaking research and practice, he became a sharpshooter with a high hit rate. Recently, he killed 103 sparrows in one day, and a total of 3,183 sparrows in more than a year. Throughout the country, there are countless heroes, men and women, old and young, who have persisted in eliminating the four pests for many years.
    Third, scientific and technological guidance and necessary drug supplies have generally kept up with the movement. Some provinces and cities have strengthened technical guidance and drug supply for eliminating the four pests, and mobilized a large number of medical and health personnel to participate in the movement. Recently, more than 20 experts in entomology, parasitology, and public health in Shanghai have served as technical guidance for the patriotic health movement. In addition to organizing personnel from municipal and district health and epidemic prevention, environmental sanitation, and other departments to be responsible for technical guidance for eliminating the four pests, the city also generally organized doctors, nurses, midwives, and other medical outpatient clinics and other health care institutions in each district to study the knowledge of eliminating the four pests and be responsible for technical guidance for eliminating the four pests according to the designated medical area. Leaders in Shanxi, Shandong, Nanjing, and other provinces and cities have also paid attention to organizing medical and health personnel and taking various technical measures to cooperate with the four-pest elimination movement.
    Fourth, many provinces, cities, and counties have put forward plans for eliminating the four pests. After the blitz, the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests must shift to regular work. Therefore, in addition to formulating short-term blitz plans for eliminating the four pests, it is also necessary to formulate relatively long-term plans so that the blitz and regular work of eliminating the four pests are combined, so that the thorough elimination of the four pests is guaranteed. When formulating plans for eliminating the four pests, many provinces and cities have paid attention to adapting to local conditions, adapting to the times, and according to the different situations in various places, in addition to eliminating the four pests, they have also included the elimination of local endemic diseases that seriously harm the people into the plan. After fully estimating the enthusiasm of the masses and criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, some provinces and cities decided to speed up the pace and realize the "Four-No" plan ahead of schedule. Jiangsu Province originally planned to complete the task of eliminating the four pests in eight years, but now it has decided to realize the "Four-No Province" in four years ahead of schedule. Guangzhou City originally planned to basically eliminate the four pests in five years, but now it has decided to achieve it two years ahead of schedule. Many provinces, cities, and counties such as Anhui, Shandong, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Changchun, as well as townships, villages, communities, and streets, have also formulated plans for eliminating the four pests and strive to achieve them ahead of schedule.
    As of January 13, more than 50% of the counties and cities in Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Liaoning, Sichuan, and other provinces have carried out patriotic health campaigns centered on eliminating the four pests, about 40% of the counties and cities in Shaanxi and Jilin provinces have carried out the movement, and about 30% of the counties and cities in Gansu, Hubei, Guangxi, Yunnan, and other provinces have carried out the movement. At present, from a national perspective, the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests is still in an unbalanced state. Although the movement has been launched in many provinces and cities, it is not strong enough and is in an intermediate state, while some counties' plans for eliminating the four pests are still in the health department, and some counties have not even made arrangements at all. In some provinces and cities where the movement has formed a climax, there are still many "blank spots" and "dead spots" in organs, enterprises, and institutions. Areas where the movement is developing slowly should seize the opportunity, strengthen the leadership of the movement, and work hard to catch up.

### 动员全民　乘风破浪　除尽四害  全国千万群众投入爱国卫生运动

　　动员全民　乘风破浪　除尽四害
    全国千万群众投入爱国卫生运动
    本报讯　入冬以来，从城市到广大农村，从平原到山区，有千千万万群众以排山倒海、万马奔腾之势投入以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，取得了辉煌的战果，涌现出无数“四无”镇、乡、社、街道和单位；目前，这一运动在许多地区已经进入高潮。
    各大城市都已先后开展除四害、讲卫生运动。北京市从去年年底到今年1月底，展开了消灭城区过冬蚊蝇、捕鼠灭雀三个战役，有一百多万人参加“除四害、讲卫生”大竞赛，城、郊区已消灭老鼠、麻雀一百二十七万七千多只。根据六个区的统计，已有四百四十六个机关、工厂、学校、部队、商店等单位做到“四无”。一个多月来，上海市参加这次爱国卫生突击运动的有四百万人以上。南京、广州、长春、沈阳、西安、重庆、武汉、天津等市也发动广大群众，取得了很大成绩。
    入冬以来，全国许多省的广大农村和中小城市也都蓬蓬勃勃地开展了以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。山西省三十四个市县卷入这一运动的群众达四百多万人。全省约有80％的青少年卷入运动。过去卫生状况比较落后的一些高山深沟、地广人稀的地区，现在卫生面貌已经大变。现在全省涌现出的基本“四无”村达二百六十九个，一般清洁卫生村由去年10月以前的三百二十个跃进到九百四十个。运动在江苏省各县市已经基本全面展开。据去年12月中旬统计，全省已出现三千八百六十多个无鼠、无蝇、无蚊、无雀的村镇和居民点。其他各省的许多县市也都开展了除四害运动，出现了不少“四无”单位。
    今年在全国范围内开展的以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动有这样一些特点：
    第一，许多省、市、县的党政领导对这次运动极为重视。上海市党政领导改变了过去凡事都要层层开会动员布置的工作方法，改为由党政机关负责人直接领导布置，并且亲自率领广大干部群众参加运动，使运动迅速掀起高潮。中共江苏省委和南京市委书记和南京市长等许多领导干部同群众一起打扫马路和灭蚊灭蝇。其他许多省市的党政负责人也都亲自挂帅领导运动，及时进行检查，因而使运动能够坚持不懈。
    第二，这次运动的规模之大，范围之广是过去历次卫生运动所少有的。许多省、市、县发动了千千万万群众投入以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。北京、上海等大城市和各省的许多县市作到了“家喻户晓”和“家家动员，人人动手”。在运动中，各地涌现出无数除四害积极分子。卫生模范和除四害积极分子在这次运动中都发挥了带头作用。南京市的卫生模范和除四害积极分子除向群众介绍自己的除四害经验外，还带动周围群众积极投入爱国卫生运动。全国甲等卫生模范鲁大妈带头率领居民大扫除。安徽行政学院炊事员朱兆义用土枪打麻雀，经过刻苦钻研和实习，成为百发百中的神枪手，最近一天打麻雀一百零三只，一年多来共打麻雀三千一百八十三只。在全国各地，这种坚持除四害数年如一日的男男女女、老老少少的英雄们是数不胜数的。
    第三，科学技术指导和必要的药物供应一般都跟上了运动。一些省市加强了除四害的技术指导和药物供应工作，并且动员了广大医疗卫生人员参加运动。最近，上海市二十多位昆虫、寄生虫、公共卫生等方面的专家担任了爱国卫生运动的技术指导。该市除了组织市、区卫生防疫、环境卫生等部门人员担负除四害的技术指导工作外，还由各区普遍组织医疗门诊和其他保健机构的医生、护士、助产士等进行除四害业务知识的学习，按划区医疗负责地段担任除四害的技术指导。山西、山东、南京等省市领导上也注意组织医疗卫生人员和采取各种技术措施，配合除四害运动。
    第四，许多省、市、县都提出了除四害的规划。以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，在突击运动以后，必须转入经常，因此，除了制定短期的突击性的除四害计划外，还必须制订比较长期的规划，使除四害的突击工作和经常工作相结合，这样，彻底消灭四害才有保证。许多省市在制定除四害规划的时候注意了因地制宜，因时制宜，并且根据各地的不同情况，除了消灭四害外，还把消灭本地的危害人民严重的地方病也订入规划。有些省市在充分估计群众的积极性和批判了右倾保守思想以后，决定加快步伐，提前实现“四无”规划。江苏省原规划八年完成除四害任务，现在决定提前在四年内实现“四无省”；广州市原订五年基本消灭四害，现在决定提前两年实现。安徽、山东、广东、江西、上海、杭州、长春等许多省、市、县以至乡、村、社、街道等也都订出了除四害规划，并且力争提前实现。
    到1月13日，江苏、安徽、浙江、福建、山东、辽宁、四川等省已有50％以上的县市开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，陕西、吉林等省有40％左右的县市开展运动，甘肃、湖北、广西、云南等省，有30％左右的县市开展运动。目前从全国范围看，以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动还处在不平衡状态。有不少省市运动虽已开展，但还不够有力，处于中间状况，而有些县的除四害计划还在卫生部门，有些县甚至根本没有进行布置。在运动已经形成高潮的一些省市机关、企业事业单位，“空白点”和“死角”还很多。运动开展迟缓的地区，要抓紧时机，加强运动的领导，加劲赶上去。
