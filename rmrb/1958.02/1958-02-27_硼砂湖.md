    Borax Lake

    Qinghai has discovered a borax lake with rich reserves. This was proven after a joint exploration by the Institute of Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences, the Petroleum Team of the Ministry of Geology, and the Qinghai Provincial Borax Team.

    Over the past few years, these units have found borax-containing soil and lake water in many places in Qinghai, but finding such rich borax deposits under the lake water is a first. They used drilling rigs to drill sixteen holes through the lake water into the soil, and fourteen of them contained borax, showing great mining value.

    The discovery of Borax Lake provides favorable conditions for the leap forward in Qinghai's local industry. Upon hearing the news, relevant departments are preparing to organize 2,000 people to mine it, planning to produce more than 3,000 tons this year, and later reaching an annual output of 20,000 to 30,000 tons.

    硼砂湖
    青海发现一处蕴藏丰富的硼砂湖。这是科学院化学研究所和地质部石油队以及青海省硼砂队等单位联合钻探以后证明的。
    这些单位几年来在青海许多地方找到含有硼砂的土质和湖水，但是在湖水下面找到如此丰富的硼砂矿藏，还是第一次。他们用钻机透过湖水在泥土中钻了十六孔，其中十四孔都有硼砂，并且有极大的开采价值。
    硼砂湖的发现，给青海地方工业的跃进提供了有利条件。有关部门闻讯以后，准备组织两千人前去开采，计划在今年生产三千多吨，以后达到年产两三万吨。　　　（新华社）
