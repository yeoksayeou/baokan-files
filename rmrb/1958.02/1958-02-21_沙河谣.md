    Shahe's water flows long and long,
    The banks were once a white expanse;
    Large and small sandy lands,
    Not even cogongrass or foxtail grew!
    Shahe's water twists and turns,
    Villages on both banks suffered floods,
    Nine years out of ten the water swelled,
    Every household cried to the heavens.
    Shahe's water flows long and long,
    Now the crops stand tall and green;
    Connected into large tracts of paddy fields,
    Planting wheat, planting rice, planting sorghum!
    Shahe's water twists and turns,
    Canals are opened, and wasteland reclaimed on both banks;
    Every year brings a good harvest and a good life,
    Shahe no longer causes floods!
              (Luojiazhuang, Hankou)

    沙河谣
    袁同兴
    沙河流水长又长，
    从前两岸白茫茫；
    大大小小沙滩地，
    菅草、谷莠都不长！
    沙河流水弯又弯，
    两岸村庄遭水淹，
    十有九年涨大水，
    家家户户哭翻天。
    沙河流水长又长，
    如今庄稼青堂堂；
    连成大块水田地，
    种麦、种稻、种高粱！
    沙河流水弯又弯，
    两岸开渠修荒滩；
    年年丰收生活好，
    沙河再不闹水淹！
              （汉口罗家庄）
