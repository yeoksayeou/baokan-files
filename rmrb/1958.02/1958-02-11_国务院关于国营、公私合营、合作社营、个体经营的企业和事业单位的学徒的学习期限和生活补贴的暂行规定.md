Since liberation, in order to meet the needs of China's economic construction, enterprises and institutions have adopted short-term methods of master-apprentice training and technical training classes to train a large number of skilled workers. This was necessary to solve the then-serious shortage of skilled workers. However, due to the short learning period, most apprentices, after becoming formal workers, have low technical skills and lack independent operational abilities. At the same time, the living standards during the learning period were too high, and promotions were too fast after the learning period, which not only failed to encourage young apprentices to study technology diligently but also affected the unity of new and old workers and the cooperation between masters and apprentices. It even made many handicraftsmen, service industries, and individual manual or mental laborers unwilling to recruit and train apprentices. This situation is detrimental to the national construction cause and youth employment. In order to encourage handicraftsmen, service industries, and individual manual or mental laborers to actively recruit and train apprentices, to provide more employment opportunities for the vast number of young people, to enable apprentices to have sufficient time to learn multiple skills and businesses, to learn necessary political and cultural knowledge, and to develop strong physiques, and to comprehensively improve the quality of China's reserve workers and staff, we must change the current methods of training apprentices. We should proceed from China's actual situation of a large population and economic backwardness, based on the principle of overall planning and building the country diligently and thriftily, appropriately absorb the advantages of our past apprenticeship system, and rationally stipulate the learning period and living standards for apprentices.

For this reason, the learning period and living allowances for apprentices (including trainees) in state-owned, joint state-private, cooperative-operated, and individually-operated enterprises and institutions are now stipulated as follows:

I.	The age of apprentices should generally be over sixteen years old, and some special industries may be less than sixteen years old. The learning period for apprentices should be three years. The learning period for technically simple jobs can be appropriately shortened, but it must not be less than two years. The learning period for technically complex jobs can be appropriately extended. The specific learning period for apprentices in each industry, and the specific requirements for learning technology and business, shall be separately stipulated by the central departments in charge of central state-owned and joint state-private enterprises and institutions according to the actual situation, and shall be implemented after being reviewed and balanced by the Ministry of Labor; local state-owned and joint state-private enterprises and institutions shall refer to the regulations of central state-owned and joint state-private enterprises and institutions for implementation.

	The learning period for apprentices trained by joint state-private enterprises with unfixed interest, handicraft cooperatives, and individual manual or mental laborers should also generally be three years.

II.	During the learning period, apprentices shall be paid a monthly living allowance by the unit where they are located. The standard of living allowance shall be calculated and stipulated according to the food expenses of general low-level employees in the local area or industry, plus a small amount of pocket money. The pocket money can be stipulated as 2 to 3 yuan per month in the first year, 3 to 5 yuan per month in the second year, and 5 to 8 yuan per month in the third year, according to the different consumption levels in urban and rural areas. The specific standards of this living allowance shall be formulated by the People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government according to the above principles, and shall be uniformly implemented within the scope of the province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government; the railway and shipping systems shall be formulated by their respective central departments in charge and implemented within the scope of the department, and shall be submitted to the Ministry of Labor for record.

	The living allowance for apprentices trained by joint state-private enterprises with unfixed interest, handicraft cooperatives, and individual manual or mental laborers can generally adopt the lower standard in the above regulations.

III.	The wage system (including piece-rate wage system) applicable to workers and staff in each unit shall not be applicable to apprentices; the reward system and allowance measures, except for some one-time rewards and labor protection benefits that can be appropriately enjoyed, shall not be applicable to apprentices. Apprentices can enjoy labor insurance benefits in accordance with relevant regulations.

IV.	After apprentices have studied for a period of time and possess certain technical or business abilities, in order to strengthen their practical training or due to the needs of production and work, the administrative side can assign them to engage in certain formal work. However, before the end of the learning period, they must not be transferred to formal workers or staff in advance. After the end of the learning period, they can be transferred to formal workers or staff only after passing the examination. The wages of apprentices in the first year after being transferred to formal workers or staff shall be implemented according to the lowest wage standards of production workers and staff in the unit; after working for one year, their technical grades and wage grades shall be formally evaluated according to the needs of production or work, their own technical and business level, and their daily work performance.

	After the end of the learning period, apprentices trained by joint state-private enterprises with unfixed interest, handicraft cooperatives, and individual manual or mental laborers should generally be retained for one or two years, and given wage treatment slightly higher than the apprentice living allowance. After the expiry of the term, both parties are free to retain or leave.

V.	If apprentices fail to meet the expected requirements for the technology or business they should have learned after the end of the learning period, their learning period should be appropriately extended. The living allowance during the extended learning period shall be paid according to the standard of the last year of the original prescribed period.

VI.	During the learning period of apprentices, the spirit of respecting teachers and loving apprentices and mutual assistance and cooperation should be promoted between masters and apprentices. Masters should earnestly teach apprentices to learn technology and business, and apprentices should respect the teachings of the masters and abide by various work systems. At the same time, enterprises, institutions, and masters can assign apprentices to undertake some miscellaneous work or other physical labor other than technology and business according to different situations and specific needs, and apprentices must not refuse.

VII.	Enterprises and institutions should sign contracts with apprentices or masters should sign contracts with apprentices. The contract should state the duration of the study, the content of the study, the living standards during the study period, and the obligations and rights of both parties. If either party deliberately violates the provisions of the contract, the other party has the right to dismiss or suspend studies.

VIII.	The learning period of apprentices recruited by various units before the promulgation of these regulations shall still be implemented in accordance with the original relevant regulations of the State Council, and the living allowance standards (that is, the "apprentice wage standards" referred to by some units) shall also be implemented in accordance with the original standards.

IX.	The apprenticeship system may not be implemented for non-technical simple manual labor work.

X.	After the promulgation of these regulations, the People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government may formulate implementing rules or supplementary regulations.

XI.	These regulations shall come into force on the date of promulgation.

    国务院关于国营、公私合营、合作社营、个体经营的企业和事业单位的学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定
    （1957年11月16日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十五次会议原则批准）
    （1958年2月6日国务院全体会议第七十次会议修改通过）
    解放以来，为了适应我国经济建设的需要，各企业和事业单位曾经采用短期的师傅带徒弟和技工训练班的办法，训练了大批的技术工人。这从解决当时技术工人严重不足的困难来看，是必要的。但是由于学习期限太短，学徒转为正式工人以后，大都技术水平较低，缺乏独立的作业能力。同时，学习期间的生活待遇过高，学习期满后又升级太快，这不仅不能鼓励青年徒工刻苦钻研技术，而且影响到新老工人的团结和师徒之间的合作，甚至使许多手工业者、服务性行业以及个体的体力或脑力劳动者不愿意招收和培养学徒。这种情况，对于国家建设事业和青年就业都是不利的。为了鼓励手工业者、服务性行业和个体的体力或脑力劳动者积极地招收和培养学徒，使广大青年有更多的就业机会，为了使学徒能够有充分的时间学会多种技术和业务，学习必要的政治和文化知识，锻炼好强健的体格，全面地提高我国后备工人、职员的质量，我们必须改变目前培养学徒的办法。我们应该从我国人口多、经济落后的实际情况出发，根据统筹兼顾、勤俭建国的方针，适当地吸取我国过去学徒制度中的长处，合理地规定学徒的学习期限和生活待遇。
    为此，现在对于国营、公私合营、合作社营、个体经营的企业和事业单位的学徒（包括练习生）的学习期限和生活补贴，规定如下：
    一、学徒的年龄，一般应该在十六周岁以上，某些特殊行业可以少于十六周岁。学徒的学习期限应该为三年。技术比较简单的工种的学习期限可以适当缩短，但是不得少于二年。技术特殊复杂的工种的学习期限可以适当延长。各行业学徒学习的具体期限，和学习技术、业务的具体要求，中央国营和公私合营的企业、事业单位由中央各主管部门按照实际情况分别规定，经劳动部审查平衡后发布执行；地方国营和公私合营的企业、事业单位参照中央国营和公私合营的企业、事业的规定执行。
    未定息的公私合营企业、手工业合作社和个体的体力或脑力劳动者所培养的学徒，其学习期限一般也应该为三年。
    二、学徒在学习期限内，由所在单位按月发给生活补贴。生活补贴的标准，按照当地或者本行业一般低级职工的伙食费另加少数零用钱计算规定。零用钱可以根据城乡的不同消费水平，规定为第一年每月二元至三元，第二年每月三元至五元，第三年每月五元至八元。这种生活补贴的具体标准，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会根据上述原则制定，在本省、自治区、直辖市范围内统一执行；铁道、航运系统各由其中央主管部门制定，在本部门范围内执行，都报送劳动部备案。
    未定息的公私合营企业、手工业合作社和个体的体力或脑力劳动者所培养的学徒的生活补贴，一般可以采用上述规定中的较低标准。
    三、各单位适用于工人、职员的工资制度（包括计件工资制），都不适用于学徒；奖励制度和津贴办法，除了某些一次性奖励和属于劳动保护性质的待遇可以适当享受以外，其余都不适用于学徒。学徒可以按照有关的规定享受劳动保险待遇。
    四、学徒经过一个时期的学习，具备了一定的技术或者业务能力以后，为了加强他们的实际锻炼或者由于生产和工作的需要，行政方面可以分配他们从事某些正式工作。但是，在学习期限未满以前，一律不得提前转为正式工人、职员。在学习期满以后，经过考试合格，才能够转为正式工人、职员。学徒转为正式工人、职员后第一年的工资，按照所在单位生产工人和职员的最低工资标准执行；工作满一年以后，再根据生产或者工作的需要、本人的技术、业务水平和平日的工作成绩，正式评定他们的技术等级和工资等级。
    未定息的公私合营企业、手工业合作社和个体的体力或脑力劳动者所培养的学徒，学习期满以后，一般应该留用一年或者二年，给予稍高于学徒生活补贴的工资待遇。期满以后，留用或者离职，双方自便。
    五、学徒学习期满以后，如果对于应该学会的技术或者业务未能达到预定的要求，应该酌量延长他们的学习期限。在延长学习期间的生活补贴，按照原规定期限的最后一年的标准发给。
    六、在学徒学习期限内，师徒之间应该发扬尊师爱徒和互助合作的精神。师傅应该认真地教导学徒学习技术、业务，学徒应该尊重师傅的教导，并且遵守各种工作制度。同时，企业、事业单位和师傅可以根据不同情况和具体需要，分配学徒担负一部分技术、业务以外的杂务工作或者其他体力劳动，学徒不得拒绝。
    七、企业、事业单位同学徒或者师傅同学徒之间，都应该订立合同。合同上写明学习的期限、学习的内容、学习期间的生活待遇以及双方的义务和权利。如果任何一方故意破坏合同规定的时候，另一方有权辞退或者停学。
    八、各单位在本规定发布以前招收的学徒的学习期限仍然按照国务院原来的有关规定执行，生活补贴标准（即有些单位所称的“学徒工资标准”），也仍然按照原来的标准执行。
    九、凡是非技术性的简单的体力劳动工作，可以不实行学徒制度。
    十、本规定发布以后，各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会可以制定实施细则或者补充规定。
    十一、本规定自发布之日起施行。
