Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 25th: Shanghai Film Studio is breaking with conventions and taking the lead in leaping forward.

    Last year, the various factories under Shanghai Film Studio produced seventeen feature films. The original plan for this year was to produce twenty-three feature films. At the symposium of Shanghai intellectuals on the first day of the Lunar New Year, Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on intellectuals to work harder and catch up with the situation, especially mentioning the issue of literary and artistic work. He said: We are now living in a great era, life is so rich and colorful, new people, new things, and new atmospheres are emerging everywhere. "Shanghai Film Studio" has so many people, why can it only produce twenty-three films this year, and not thirty-five better films?
    The various factories under Shanghai Film Studio launched a heated discussion on this question raised by the Party committee. Screenwriters, directors, actors, art designers, and technicians all expressed full confidence in realizing the Great Leap Forward. They actively tapped their potential, challenged and responded to each other, full of revolutionary drive. Yang Xiaozhong, a 58-year-old director, announced his five-year plan: to write two scripts, direct eight films, and train two assistant directors. Director Sun Yu immediately responded, proposing that each director train two to four apprentices. Cinematographer Feng Sizhi believes that Shanghai Film Studio currently has twenty-one cinematographers. If each person shoots two films a year, the entire studio can shoot forty-two films a year. He hopes to quickly achieve the goal of both people and machines moving. Actors demanded to overcome the shortcomings of excessively detailed division of labor and insufficient utilization of talents in the past. In addition to acting, they can also engage in makeup and production affairs when shooting on location. At present, the preliminary production tasks determined by Jiangnan, Tianma, and Haiyan film studios this year have been increased to thirty-eight. The fine arts film studio has determined that the production of puppet films, animated films, etc. this year will increase from twenty to thirty-three.
    At the symposium of Shanghai Film Studio employees held on the 23rd, Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, praised the revolutionary drive of Shanghai Film Studio. He said: The literary and art circles must also adapt to China's industrial and agricultural production and have a Great Leap Forward. He hopes that the film industry will take the lead, and Shanghai Film Studio will take the lead in the national film industry. He said: The comrades in Shanghai are energetic, fast, dare to innovate, and are not conservative in their work. He believes that Shanghai Film Studio's plan for thirty-five films this year will definitely be overfulfilled.
    Zhou Yang pointed out: The cultural and educational undertakings are lagging behind compared to the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. The main reason is that the leadership is lagging behind the masses, and the leadership has conservative ideas. Now that Shanghai Film Studio has increased the film production to thirty-five films, this is based on the rectification and anti-rightist campaign, the Great Leap Forward in national industrial and agricultural production, and the anti-waste and anti-conservative campaigns. Literature and art are a reflection of the entire social life and the people's struggle. Without the high tide of socialist revolution and construction, there is a lack of foundation for proposing thirty-five films. He said that everyone's proposal to break with conventions means breaking the old rules and regulations that hinder and restrict the productive forces, and replacing them with rules and regulations that can adapt to and promote the new productive forces, not breaking all the rules and regulations. Breaking with conventions, difficulties are inevitable. Difficulties and drive are a unity of opposites. Precisely because of the existence of difficulties, there is a need for the drive to overcome difficulties. He demanded that the guiding principle of more, faster, better, and more economical be resolutely implemented in film work, both increasing the quantity of films and improving the quality of films, seeking quality in quantity. It is necessary to organize a film team that is both red and expert, and to train apprentices. If the script is difficult, the method of collaboration between screenwriters and directors can be adopted, novels can be adapted, and a certain number of opera films can also be shot. With a certain number of films, it is possible to talk about competition. He believes that through everyone's efforts, China's films will definitely be able to compete with the films of capitalist countries internationally. Originally, we have already surpassed them in politics and ideology. After a certain period of effort in product quantity and technical level, we will definitely be able to surpass them as well.

    生活丰富多采新人新事到处涌现
    上影打破常规带头跃进
    新华社上海25日电　上海电影制片公司打破常规带头跃进。
    上海电影制片公司所属各厂去年生产了十七部故事片，今年原定计划生产二十三部故事片。在农历新春初一的上海知识界代表人士座谈会上，中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施号召知识分子快马加鞭赶上形势时，特别提到文艺工作问题。他说：我们现在生活在一个伟大的时代，生活如此丰富多采，新人新事新风气到处涌现，“上影”有那么多人，为什么今年只能出二十三部，不能出三十五部比较好的影片？
    上影所属各厂对党委提出的这个问题展开了热烈的讨论。各厂编剧、导演、演员、美工和技术人员，都表示完全有信心实现大跃进，他们积极挖掘潜力，互相挑战、应战，充满了革命干劲。五十八岁的老导演杨小仲宣布了他的五年计划：要写出二个剧本，导演八部电影，带二个助理导演以后，导演孙瑜马上应战，他提出每个导演都带二个到四个学徒。摄影师冯四知认为上影现有摄影师二十一人，每人每年拍二部影片，全厂每年可拍影片四十二部。他希望赶快做到人动机器也动。演员们要求克服过去分工太细、人材没有充分利用的缺点，除演戏外，他们在拍外景时还可以兼搞化装和剧务。目前，江南、天马、海燕三个电影制片厂初步确定的今年生产任务已提高到三十八部。美术片厂确定今年生产的木偶片、动画片等将从二十本增加到三十三本。
    在23日举行的上影职工座谈会上，中共中央宣传部副部长周扬赞扬了上影的革命干劲。他说：文艺界也要和我国的工农生产相适应，来个大跃进，他希望电影走在第一位，而上影又走在全国电影界的第一位。他说：上海的同志做工作有劲道，快，敢于革新，不保守。他相信今年上影的三十五部电影计划，一定能够超额完成。
    周扬指出：文教事业和工农业大跃进比较是显得落后的。主要是领导落后于群众，领导有保守思想。现在上影提高影片产量到三十五部，这是经过整风和反右派，在全国工农业生产大跃进，反浪费、反保守的情况下提出来的，是有根据的。文艺是整个社会生活和人民斗争的反映，没有社会主义革命和建设高潮，提出三十五部就缺乏基础。他说，大家提出要打破常规，是指要打破那些妨碍和束缚生产力的旧规章制度，用能够适应和促进新的生产力的规章制度来代替，不是把一切规章制度都打破。要打破常规，困难当然难免。困难和干劲是对立的统一，正因为困难的存在，才需要克服困难的干劲。他要求在电影工作中坚决贯彻多、快、好、省的方针，既要增加电影的数量，也要提高电影的质量，量中求质。要组织电影界又红又专的队伍，要带徒弟。剧本困难，可以采取编导协作办法，可以改编小说，也可以拍摄一定数量的戏曲片。有了一定数量的影片，才能谈得到竞赛。他相信经过大家的努力，我国的影片一定能在国际上和资本主义国家的影片竞赛。本来在政治、思想上我们早已超过了他们，在产品数量和技术水平上经过一定时期的努力，也一定能够超过他们。
