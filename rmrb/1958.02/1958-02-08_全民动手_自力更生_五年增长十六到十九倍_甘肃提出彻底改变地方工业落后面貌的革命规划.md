The whole people take action, self-reliance.
Five-year growth of sixteen to nineteen times
Gansu proposes a revolutionary plan to completely change the backward state of local industry.

(Our newspaper, Lanzhou, February 7th, reporter Gu Lei reports:) At the plenary session of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held on February 1st, a five-year development plan for local industry was determined. By 1962, the output value will increase sixteen to nineteen times, catching up with or exceeding the total agricultural output value. The meeting called on the people of the province to work hard for five years to completely change the backward state of local industry.

During the first five-year plan period, local industry in Gansu Province has greatly developed. The total output value was more than 23 million yuan in 1949, reached more than 50 million yuan in 1952, and increased to 150 million yuan in 1957, with an average annual growth rate of 23.8%. The output of major products of local industry increased by two to eight times, and more than 5,400 new products were added. However, due to the weak original foundation and the failure of relevant departments to pay attention to active development, it has lagged far behind agricultural production. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that this backward state cannot meet the needs of the development of large industry and agriculture and is not conducive to production and people's lives. Therefore, it was decided to mobilize all forces to promote the rapid development of local industry, to continuously leap forward within five years, and to catch up with or exceed the total agricultural output value. The absolute figures for this plan are: the total agricultural output value is expected to be 2.7 billion yuan in 1962, and the total local industrial output value will reach 2.4 billion to 2.8 billion yuan.

In Gansu, where local industry is not very developed, a series of difficulties will be encountered in terms of funds, equipment, technology, raw materials, and manpower if one wants to increase from 150 million to 2.4 billion to 2.8 billion in five years. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China saw this, but also saw many favorable factors. First of all, with the large-scale development of water conservancy and the rapid development of agricultural production, the vast number of farmers urgently need a large amount of various means of production (new agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, waterwheels, transportation tools, generators, etc.), living materials, and cultural products. In order to obtain these things, many agricultural cooperatives are willing to invest in industry. This not only prepares the market for local industry but also prepares a considerable amount of funds. The second is that Gansu Province has resources for the development of various local industries. In terms of minerals, there are iron, copper, coal, petroleum, gold, lead, zinc, manganese, tungsten sand, sulfur, etc. In terms of plants: there are various medicinal materials, papermaking raw materials, glue-making raw materials, woody oil materials, as well as cotton, hemp, flax, Apocynum venetum, sugar beets, etc. In terms of animals: there are silk (including tussah silk), fur, cheese, meat, etc. In recent years, Gansu has established many large industries, and some factories can also be developed by utilizing the waste products of large factories. For example, Lanzhou City is preparing to collect short materials and waste materials from various factories to build a steelmaking plant with an annual output of 30,000 tons of steel ingots. Another is that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, various right-leaning conservative ideas have been eliminated, and everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm has increased. According to the plans reported by various regions for the development of local industry, most of them are developing several times or dozens of times. For example, the output value of Pingliang Prefecture in 1957 was 4.65 million yuan, and it will be 160 million to 180 million yuan by 1962. The original output value of Zhangye Prefecture was 2.93 million yuan, and it will be 260 million to 280 million yuan by 1962. These favorable conditions can ensure the rapid development of local industry in Gansu despite its weak foundation, lack of technology, and few factories transferred from the central government.

In order to realize the grand development plan of local industry, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that the following measures must be taken.

First, the whole party and the whole people must take action to run local industry, so as to achieve blossoming and fruiting everywhere. The development of local industry must serve agricultural production and be closely combined with the economic development of rural areas, relying on agriculture to develop industry. At the same time, local industry must serve large industry. Through this step, we can guarantee to gradually meet the needs of large industrial construction, agricultural production development, and the improvement of people's lives. The preliminary plan is to supply more than 730,000 new agricultural tools of various kinds to rural areas by 1962, 150,000 water conservancy machines with about 600,000 horsepower, 420,000 tons of various fertilizers, 150 million tons of pesticides, and assist each county in building more than two power stations. In addition, there are various products that serve large industry.

Second, in terms of funds, equipment, and manpower, except for certain key projects that are assisted by the state, all will be self-reliant. There are six ways to raise funds: mobilize the masses to invest; agricultural cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives withdraw part of their public accumulation to run industry; old factories and mining enterprises accumulate, expand reproduction, and run affiliated enterprises; absorb surplus and excess commercial fixed assets for industry; local self-raised funds and joint investment with neighboring provinces. There can be various forms of operation, such as joint ventures between handicrafts and agricultural cooperatives, joint ventures between supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives, and public assistance. The solutions to the equipment problem are: to make plans in advance, order necessary equipment in advance, and strive to start construction as soon as possible; to arrange for the province's machinery industry to share tasks and try to manufacture the required equipment, and to transfer surplus equipment from existing factories and mines; to use old and dilapidated equipment in old factories and mines for repair and use. The solutions to the shortage of technical personnel are: to transfer them from local old enterprises; to strive for some support from state-owned enterprises; to train a large number of apprentices through masters; to run short-term training courses; to expand existing industrial technical schools; to select and use technical personnel from demobilized soldiers; to organize engineering and technical personnel from various departments to return to their posts; to send people to other provinces to learn new technologies in a planned and organized manner.

Third, in order to speed up the construction of local industry, it is necessary to fully tap the potential of existing enterprises, make overall plans, and do everything possible to increase new products, expand output value, reduce costs, improve quality, and make product quality reach the advanced national level as soon as possible. Strive to increase accumulation and expand reproduction. At the same time, attention should be paid to the combination of five major aspects in development, namely: the combination of specialized business organs and the broad masses, the combination of large, medium and small, the combination of new and old enterprises, the combination of the latest technology and general technology, and the combination of mechanical operation and manual labor. In the process of development, special attention should be paid to implementing the "more, faster, better, and more economical" policy.

　　全民动手  自力更生
    五年增长十六到十九倍
    甘肃提出彻底改变地方工业落后面貌的革命规划
    本报兰州7日电　记者顾雷报道：在2月1日举行的中共甘肃省委员会全体会议上，确定了地方工业五年发展计划，至1962年产值将提高十六倍至十九倍，赶上或超过农业总产值。会议号召全省人民苦战五年，彻底改变地方工业的落后面貌。
    第一个五年计划期间，甘肃省的地方工业有很大的发展。1949年总产值二千三百多万元，1952年达到五千多万元，1957年增至一亿五千万元，每年平均增长速度为23.8％。地方工业的主要产品产量增加二至八倍，新产品增加五千四百多种。但是，由于原来的基础太薄弱，加上有关部门没有注意积极发展，以致远落在农业生产的后面。中共甘肃省委认为这种落后状态，是不能适应大工业和农业发展需要的，是不利于生产和人民生活的。因此，决定动员一切力量，促进地方工业快马加鞭，在五年内连续跃进，赶上或超过农业总产值。这个计划的绝对数字是：预计1962年农业总产值为二十七亿元，地方工业总产值达到二十四亿到二十八亿元。
    在地方工业不很发达的甘肃，想在五年内从一亿五千万提至二十四亿到二十八亿，会在资金、设备、技术、原料、人力方面遇到一系列困难。中共甘肃省委看到了这点；但同时也看到了许多有利的因素。首先是广大农民随着大兴水利、农业生产的迅速发展，迫切需要大量的各种生产资料（新式农具、化学肥料、水车、运输工具、发电机等）和生活资料以及文化用品。农民为了获得这些东西，许多农业社都有投资举办工业的愿望。这不仅给地方工业准备了市场，而且准备了相当数量的资金。另一个是甘肃省有着发展各种地方工业的资源。矿产方面，有铁、铜、煤、石油、黄金、铅、锌、锰、钨砂、硫磺等。植物方面：有各种药材、造纸原料、制胶原料、木本油料，以及棉、麻、亚麻、罗布麻、甜菜等。动物方面：有蚕丝（包括柞蚕丝）、皮毛、奶酪、肉类等。几年来，甘肃建立了许多大工业，利用大工厂的残废品也可发展一些工厂。如兰州市准备搜集各厂的短材废料，建年产三万吨钢锭的炼钢厂一座。再一个是自中央八届三中全会以后，打掉了各种右倾保守思想，大家的革命干劲大了。根据各地报来发展地方工业的计划，大都是几倍几十倍的发展。如平凉专区1957年产值是四百六十五万元，到1962年则是一亿六千万到一亿八千万元。张掖专区原产值二百九十三万元，至1962年是二亿六千万到二亿八千万元。这些有利条件就可以保证甘肃地方工业在基础薄弱、技术缺乏、中央下放工厂少的情况下迅速发展。
    为实现地方工业宏伟的发展计划，中共甘肃省委指出必须采取下列一些措施。
    第一，要全党全民动手办地方工业，做到遍地开花结果。地方工业的发展要为农业生产服务并与农村的经济发展密切结合，依靠农业发展工业。同时，要使地方工业为大工业服务。通过这个步骤，保证逐步满足大工业建设、农业生产发展、人民生活提高的需要。现在初步计划到1962年，将供应农村各种新式农具七十三万余部，水利机械十五万部约六十万匹马力，各种肥料四十二万吨，农药一万五千万吨，协助每个县修建两个以上电站。另有为大工业服务的产品多种。
    第二，在资金、设备、人力方面，除某些重点工程由国家协助外，一律自力更生。集资的办法有六：发动群众投资；由农业社、手工业合作社、供销合作社抽出部分公共积累办工业；老厂矿企业积累，扩大再生产，办附属企业；吸收多余的过剩的商业固定资产用于工业；地方自筹经费，和邻省联合投资。经营形式可多种多样，如手工业和农业社合营、供销社和手工业社合营、公办互助等。解决设备的办法是：提前做计划，提前订制必要的设备，争取早日开工；安排本省机械工业分摊任务，尽力制造所需设备，从现有厂矿中抽调多余设备；利用老厂矿破旧设备，修理使用。解决技术力量不足的办法是：由地方老企业输送；争取国营企业部分支援；通过师傅带徒弟大量培养；举办短期训练班；扩大现有工业技术学校；从复员军人中挑选技术人材使用；组织各部门工程技术人员归队；有计划、有组织派人到外省学习新技术。
    第三，为加快地方工业的建设速度，要充分挖掘现有企业的潜力，全面规划，千方百计增加新产品，扩大产值，降低成本，提高质量，尽快使产品质量达到全国先进水平。努力增加积累，扩大再生产。同时，发展时要注意五大结合，即：专门业务机关与广大群众相结合，大中小相结合，新旧企业相结合，最新技术与一般技术相结合，机械操作与手工劳动相结合。发展过程中，特别注意贯彻“多、快、好、省”的方针。
