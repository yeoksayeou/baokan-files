　　I fully support the reports made to the congress by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now I would like to express some opinions on the main aspects of agricultural production development in Guangdong Province.

    The Great Achievements in Agricultural Production

    Tremendous Victory in Grain Production, Rapid Advance in Economic Crop Production

　　With the over-fulfillment of the national economic plan in 1957, the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has been comprehensively over-fulfilled. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of Guangdong Province have achieved great successes in the struggle to implement the first Five-Year Plan, especially in implementing the policy of focusing on agricultural production, prioritizing grain production while simultaneously developing various economic crops, forestry, animal husbandry, and aquaculture, and have achieved brilliant achievements. Starting in 1953, over the past five years, the vast number of farmers in the province have moved from an individual economy to the socialist path of collectivization. After the victorious completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture and the basic realization of its advancement, agricultural production has seen inspiring leaps forward. This is primarily reflected in the following: farmers throughout the province have launched a mass movement to build agricultural irrigation and water conservancy projects on an unprecedented scale, completing irrigation and drainage areas of 20.09 million mu and repairing 60 million cubic meters of embankments, providing 70 percent of the province's farmland with irrigation and drainage facilities, and eliminating drought on 15.52 million mu of arable land, which played a critical role in increasing crop yields; the multiple cropping index of grain crops has also greatly increased, expanding from 180 percent to 200 percent, and the winter planting area has expanded from 9 million mu to 17 million mu; about 90 percent of the province's paddy fields have adopted a set of advanced rice planting methods and cultivation techniques centered on close planting of small seedlings. All of this has resulted in an increase of 5.6 billion catties of grain compared to 1952, an increase of 30 percent, and an increase of 8.5 billion catties compared to before liberation, an increase of more than 50 percent. The yield per unit area has increased from 350 catties in 1949 to 510 catties. In 1956, the province had six counties with grain yields of over 1,000 catties, 592 townships with grain yields of over 1,000 catties, and 3,699 cooperatives with grain yields of over 1,000 catties. In 1957, there was a high-yield demonstration field in Napa Cooperative, Hua County, with two crops yielding 2,663 catties of rice per mu, and a large area of 2,000 mu of high-yield fields in Chenghai County yielding 3,000 catties per mu (including one crop of rice and one crop of sweet potatoes converted to grain). Due to the great victory in grain production, it is possible to develop diversified operations and comprehensively develop production. The total output of economic crops has also increased greatly. Except for silk, the output has greatly exceeded the pre-war level. The planting area of economic crops and tropical crops has expanded from 9.5 million mu to 15.25 million mu, an increase of 61 percent compared to before liberation. In particular, sugar production has increased rapidly, from 24,000 tons per year in the early days of liberation to 400,000 tons per year, and there have been high-yield records of 29,000 catties of sugarcane per mu; silk production has also seen high-yield records of 7,290 catties of mulberry leaves per mu. Afforestation work has also achieved great results, with a total of 20.09 million mu of forests planted in five years, exceeding the plan issued by the central government by 1.6 times. The total output of marine and freshwater fisheries was only 335,000 tons in 1952, but it increased to 620,000 tons in 1957, exceeding the pre-war peak level of 480,000 tons; the highest record for pond fish was 1,954 catties per mu. Pig farming has also developed greatly, with the number of live pigs increasing from 6.55 million in 1952 to 8.1 million. The province has 7.5 million farm households, averaging more than one pig per household, and Dafu Cooperative in Lechang County, which raises the most pigs, averages 13 pigs per household. With the great development of agricultural production, a reliable material foundation has been provided for the great leap forward in the province's industrial production. The total value of industrial production has over-fulfilled the targets of the first Five-Year Plan, increasing from more than 460 million yuan in 1949 to an estimated 2.51 billion yuan in 1957, an increase of more than four times, and an increase of 1.29 times compared to the total value of industrial production in 1952, with an average annual growth rate of 18 percent. Among the total value of industrial output, those relying on agriculture for raw materials account for more than 70 percent. This means that without the great development of agricultural production, a great leap forward in industrial production would be impossible. Other work in culture, education, health, transportation, postal services, finance, trade, etc., has also developed accordingly and achieved great successes.

　　It should be affirmed that the great achievements in agricultural production are inseparable from the great victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture. In the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956, Guangdong, like the rest of the country, broke through the shackles of right-leaning conservative thinking throughout the province and saw a high tide of agricultural collectivization. Ninety-five percent of farm households participated in agricultural production cooperatives, which enabled 30 million farmers to break away from the old capitalist path and embark on the new socialist path; the polarization trend after the land reform was replaced by the prospect of common prosperity, becoming a new starting point for the historical development of the entire countryside. Once the cooperatives were established, they showed great superiority. From the winter of 1955 to the first half of 1956, an unprecedented high tide of production was launched, building water conservancy projects benefiting 10 million mu, accumulating 2.4 billion dan of fertilizer, and overcoming natural disasters unseen in decades. In just a few months, they did much work that could not be done in the past few generations, thus making 1956 an unprecedented year for agricultural crops. On the basis of increased production in agricultural cooperatives, the income of cooperative members has also increased year by year. At present, 35 to 40 percent of farm households (2.67 million to 3.5 million households) and about 20 percent of cooperatives have caught up with or exceeded the production and income levels of upper-middle peasants.

    Right-Leaning Conservative Thinking Once Emerged, Causing Losses to Last Year's Production and Work

　　However, from the second half of 1956 to the first half of 1957, a countercurrent of right-leaning conservative thinking emerged in agricultural production. It was mainly manifested in: some people did not have enough confidence in the great vitality of the cooperative system and the strong strength of collective farmers, adopted a negative attitude towards agricultural production development, and lacked the revolutionary spirit and drive to overcome difficulties. Not only did they not encourage and support the newly established cooperatives and the great achievements in agricultural production, but they also made many criticisms, nitpicked, and exaggerated shortcomings, denying achievements, and saying it was "rash advance." They adopted a critical attitude towards the shortcoming of insufficient attention to a small number of economic crops while prioritizing the development of grain production, concentrating efforts to solve the grain problem, and eliminating tensions, and launched a large-scale attack on the province's agricultural production policies; they criticized the large investment in labor for the century-long plan of farmland water conservancy construction and the shock fertilizer accumulation movement, which once affected a little sideline production; they did not analyze the shortcomings caused by a small part of the implementation of agricultural production increase measures and technological reforms due to unqualified conditions or quality, but instead erased the achievements; they even attributed some of the inevitable temporary difficulties of farmers after joining the cooperatives to the development of agricultural production with a revolutionary spirit. They exaggerated the difficulties in farmers' lives, describing the countryside as completely dark; they did not understand that in the great changes in the economic system and social production, it is completely unavoidable and actually a normal phenomenon that leaders and the masses lack experience and have some shortcomings in certain aspects. It must be affirmed that what we need to overcome is only some subjectivism and bureaucratic work styles in work, especially in leadership work, while the revolutionary vigor and creative spirit of the vast number of cadres and the masses should be protected and developed a hundredfold. Unanalyzed denial will have a very bad cold water effect on that precious enthusiasm and beneficial initiatives, and will only reverse the revolutionary spirit and increase the conservative tendency of being tied up, fearful, and afraid to boldly move forward. The losses caused by this right-leaning conservative thinking to the production and work of 1957 are lessons we must deeply remember.

    Twelve-Year Plan for Agricultural Construction

　　The Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that China's economic construction policy must be "to implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry." This policy is completely correct and completely suitable for the specific situation in Guangdong. In order to unswervingly implement this policy, in order to ensure the realization of the National Agricultural Development Program in Guangdong Province, and strive to realize it ahead of schedule, Guangdong has decided that the second Five-Year Plan and even the third Five-Year Plan will still focus on the development of agricultural production, developing economic crops, forestry, animal husbandry, and aquaculture while prioritizing the development of grain production. While developing agriculture, actively develop light industry, the food industry, the salt industry, non-ferrous metals, and corresponding vigorous development of the chemical fertilizer industry, agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, and agricultural product processing industry that serve agricultural production and are closely related to agricultural production, as well as transportation, etc. And according to this spirit and the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program, we have formulated the province's twelve-year agricultural construction plan as a program of action for the people of the province.

    Grain Yield of 800 Catties per Mu in 1962, Achieving "Thousand-Cattie Province" in 1967

　　Guangdong Province's twelve-year agricultural construction plan requires that the average yield of grain per mu increase from 440 catties in 1955 to 800 catties in 1962, and to 1,000 catties in 1967, achieving a "thousand-cattie province," and the total output will increase from 21.8 billion catties to 48 billion catties; economic crops will expand from the existing planting area of 7 million mu to 26 million mu (all relying on wasteland reclamation and development to hills and mountainous areas). The main economic crops: sugarcane will increase more than five times, silk will increase more than ten times, and various fruits will increase several times; the number of live pigs will increase from the current social stock of 8 million to 30 million (annual feeding volume of 45 million); aquaculture will develop from an annual output of 620,000 tons in 1957 to 2.5 million tons. Within two years, the province will eliminate drought, eliminate ordinary floods and complete greening within five years, and also stipulate that insect pests will be eliminated in several years, agricultural production will gradually realize mechanization, a water and land transportation network will be built, the four pests will be eliminated, illiteracy will be eliminated, and primary education will be popularized. Undoubtedly, the development of agriculture will inevitably promote the faster development of industry. Just in terms of the province's sugar industry, it can develop from the current annual output of 400,000 tons to more than 2.5 million tons. And there are three by-products with large quantities and great economic value in the sugar-making process: bagasse, waste molasses, and filter mud. If the province's annual sugar production reaches 1.2 million tons in 1962, 2 million tons of bagasse can be obtained, which can be used to make paper, producing 875,000 tons of paper, which is 25 percent cheaper than mechanical wood paper and three times lower than bleached reed pulp paper; if all the bagasse is used to make artificial fibers, 200,000 tons of fiber can be produced annually, which can offset the lint output of 10 million mu of cotton fields, and 1 million pieces of yarn can be made, and the made cotton cloth can provide each person in the country with two meters. If the utilization of the above by-products can be realized, it will be of great significance to both material production and capital accumulation. Therefore, in addition to the province entrusting relevant departments to organize forces to specialize in planning and research, it is hoped that the central government can provide strong technical support, and it is hoped that the policy of utilizing sugar-making by-products can be determined as soon as possible. By then, the average person in Guangdong Province will have 1,000 catties of grain, one pig, more than 100 catties of fish, dozens of fruit trees, and more than 100 catties of sugar, and we will be able to supply the needs of the whole country with more food materials.

    Constantly Launching Production Upsurges, Confident of Realizing the Plan

　　After discussion throughout the province, it is believed that the province's twelve-year agricultural construction plan is confident and sure of achieving the goal of a "thousand-cattie province" by 1967. This is not only because Guangdong Province has relatively superior natural conditions and the vast number of farmers have a tradition of diligence, frugality, intensive farming, and meticulous work, but more importantly, there is a relatively solid foundation for collectivization and two years of experience in organizing collective production and operation management. The rural socialist education and democratic rectification movement in the past six months have greatly improved the awareness of the masses, improved the operation and management of the cooperatives, and made the socialist position in the countryside more consolidated with absolute advantages, providing a reliable political guarantee for the realization of the twelve-year plan. And the many high-yield examples created in the past one or two years have set a living example for striving for large-area high yields. At the same time, with the leap forward in national industry, the level of science and technology will rapidly improve in the next ten years, which will inevitably greatly promote the development of agricultural production. Of course, natural conditions and work foundations can only provide the possibility for completing and over-fulfilling the task of increasing production. More importantly, we must, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, mobilize all positive factors, organize and lead the masses of the people throughout the province, work diligently and conscientiously in all aspects with full effort, and constantly launch one production upsurge after another to promote the great leap forward in the entire industrial and agricultural production.

    Measures to Complete Various Tasks

　　In order to complete the various tasks of the National Agricultural Development Program and the province's twelve-year agricultural construction plan ahead of schedule, we believe that we must work hard to do the following work.

    Continue to Focus on Developing Agriculture, and Actively Develop Industry and Other Undertakings at the Same Time

　　(1) We must unswervingly continue to implement the established policy of focusing on the development of agriculture while actively developing light industry, the food industry, the salt industry, the non-ferrous metal industry, the chemical fertilizer industry, the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, the agricultural product processing industry, and transportation in the next five to ten years. Practice has proved that the upsurge of socialist transformation of agriculture in China has promoted and accelerated the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; and the great leap forward in agricultural production will inevitably directly and indirectly promote the great leap forward in industry and other production and construction undertakings. In particular, the province's industry is mainly light industry, the food industry, and a part of heavy industry closely related to agriculture, and their development depends to a great extent on the development of agriculture. From the results of the province's first Five-Year Plan, it is precisely because of the vigorous development of agriculture that the raw material guarantee and export material supply have been provided for industrial development. Therefore, only by continuing to concentrate the greatest efforts on developing agriculture, and at the same time making great efforts to develop local industry, can we better support the country's industrial construction and fundamentally change the face of Guangdong.

    Constantly Oppose Right-Leaning Conservative Thinking, and Rouse Great and Lasting Revolutionary Drive

　　(2) We must continue to constantly oppose right-leaning conservative thinking and rouse a great and lasting revolutionary drive. First, we must eliminate drought in the province within two years and strive to basically eliminate ordinary floods during the second Five-Year Plan. The practical experience in recent years has proved that in the development of agricultural production, advanced thinking and right-leaning conservative thinking have been stubbornly fighting each other, and the process of achieving a great leap forward in production is also the process of breaking through and getting rid of the shackles of right-leaning conservative thinking. And today, this struggle between advanced and backward is manifested more sharply and profoundly. Those old concepts that "agricultural production can only be gradual and cannot leap forward" and "production has reached the top and there is no potential to be tapped" have become the great enemies of the leap forward development of agricultural production. The lesson that the province's weather and other aspects in 1957 were better than in 1956, but the actual increase in grain production was much less than in 1956, fully illustrates this problem. After the province implemented the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, and affirmed, summarized, and promoted the valuable experience created by the vivid revolutionary spirit in various places, the broad masses were enthusiastic, energetic, and full of drive, and immediately launched a winter production upsurge centered on the construction of agricultural water conservancy. In this regard, Hailin Island District in Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province, created a vivid example of overcoming drought. This small island is isolated from the sea, with no rivers on the island and sandy beaches everywhere. However, the masses and cadres here dug ponds to store water with the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The District Committee of the Communist Party became the "District Committee for Flattening Ponds" and was located on the front line of the most intense and difficult projects, working hard with the masses for seventy days and nights, basically solving the water conservancy problem in one fell swoop, and the grain yield per mu jumped from 300 catties to 600 catties. What can be done in difficult areas like Hailin Island, there is no reason why other areas in the province cannot do it. In fact, once the masses are mobilized, infinite wisdom will immediately show its power, breaking through all human, material, and financial difficulties and making amazing achievements. Lilin Township in Huiyang County created the experience of combining water diversion and water storage in hilly areas, so that agricultural water conservancy projects such as slopes, ponds, and ditches are connected into a small and unified gravity irrigation system. After several years of hard work in building slopes to divert water, opening ditches around the mountains, building ponds on slopes, connecting ditches and ponds, and combining diversion and storage, the masses here completely eliminated drought. This kind of small water conservancy project with unified planning, phased construction, and mutual connection not only requires less investment, but also has quick results, creating an example and direction for eliminating drought in two years ahead of schedule. Second, change the shortage of fertilizer and establish a reliable source of fertilizer. The number of pigs raised in the province can be developed to 28 million by 1962, which can solve the fertilizer problem for half of the grain arable land area. In this regard, the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative in Nanhai County and the Dafu Agricultural Cooperative in Lechang County created the experience of raising more pigs, accumulating more fertilizer, and increasing production more, and the experience of Longbang First Cooperative in Xinhui County in vigorously accumulating and fully utilizing farm manure is being promoted and disseminated throughout the province. By 1962, 10 million mu of winter green manure can also be planted. In addition, the province produces 500,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, and a large amount of pond, sea, river mud and other local miscellaneous fertilizers can also be increased. Third, transform backward fields and implement all new agricultural technology reforms. At present, there are about 18 million mu of low-yielding fields with an output of less than 400 catties per mu in the province. Within three to five years, by improving soil, increasing fertilizer application, and improving cultivation methods, it is completely possible to require an average yield of more than 600 catties per mu. Fourth, basically realize "three crops a year." This is a major measure for agricultural production in the province to achieve high yields and improve land utilization. If the agricultural barrier including the above-mentioned content can be crossed or strive to cross ahead of schedule in three to five years, then Guangdong's agricultural production can leap forward on a more stable and reliable basis.

    Turn Democratic Rectification into a System and Combine it with Socialist Education

　　(3) We must constantly carry out democratic rectification and socialist education. Promote the hard work and thrift in building the country, running cooperatives, managing households, and diligent production. Through the great debate on how to build socialism, change the social atmosphere, and establish the spirit of hard work, thrift, and arduous struggle. After agricultural collectivization, although the ownership of agricultural means of production has been changed economically, socialist thinking has not been completely established, and capitalist spontaneous tendencies still exist seriously. Especially among the well-to-do middle peasants, except for a part of the conscious, a considerable part still hold a wavering attitude towards socialism and are nostalgic for taking the capitalist road. Under the ideological influence of some well-to-do middle peasants, some cooperative members are unwilling to participate in the collective production of the cooperative, only care about expanding individual family sideline businesses; are unwilling to increase the public accumulation of the cooperative, only willing to divide and eat up; are unwilling to sell fertilizer to the cooperative, only willing to actively expand the production of private plots, etc. All of these have seriously affected the consolidation of the cooperative and the development of production. After several months of democratic rectification and socialist education, this situation has been greatly changed. Experience has proved that it will take a relatively long period of effort in terms of ideology, politics, and economy to thoroughly consolidate the cooperative. Therefore, in the future, we must institutionalize democratic rectification, rectify the cooperative once a year or half a year, and closely combine socialist education with the rectification work to conduct it regularly. Economically, by expanding public accumulation, strengthening the collective economy, increasing capital construction, and improving labor management, on the premise of stabilizing the existing grain planting area and continuously improving the yield per unit area, develop diversified operations, vigorously develop animal husbandry, develop mountainous areas and hills, broaden production avenues, continuously improve the management level of the cooperative, earnestly implement the policy of democratic and frugal operation of the cooperative, and strive to make the production and income level of the cooperative catch up with or exceed the level of local upper-middle peasants within three years, and truly thoroughly consolidate the cooperative politically and economically, laying a solid political foundation and material foundation for the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    Do a Good Job in the Current Winter Production and Fight the First Battle Well

　　(4) We must earnestly do a good job in the current winter production and fight the first battle well for the great leap forward and comprehensive bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1958. At present, the labor force participating in winter production in the province has reached 15 million, accounting for 50 percent of the total agricultural population of the province, of which 9 million are engaged in the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects. After opposing right-leaning conservative thinking and further tapping potential, the planned benefiting area of water conservancy construction has been increased from more than 5 million mu to 20 million mu, of which there are 166 projects with an investment of 200,000 yuan and a benefiting area of more than 10,000 mu. And before liberation, there was only one such project in the province, and only 140 projects have been built in the eight years since liberation. At present, all the large and medium-sized water conservancy projects planned for the year have started, and the medium and small-sized water conservancy projects can be basically completed before the Spring Festival, and at least 80 percent of the large-scale water conservancy projects can be completed. The province's annual fertilizer accumulation plan was originally 5.7 billion dan, and now it has been increased to 12 billion dan, averaging 120 dan per mu. It is required to complete at least 7 billion dan before spring plowing. Chaoan County, which accumulates the most fertilizer, has averaged 220 dan per mu. It is also required to improve soil and afforest 10 million mu each. Direct seeding and afforestation have already started, and winter crops have over-fulfilled the plan of 20 million mu. The winter production movement is developing vigorously in every corner of the rural areas of the province, and it is being carried out early, with great momentum, strong enthusiasm, high confidence, rapid progress, and remarkable achievements. However, we must be soberly aware that this is only a beginning, and we must rouse greater enthusiasm, strive for greater victories on the basis of achieving victories, leap forward again, the high tide is higher, and we must never postpone what can be done this year to next year, and resolutely realize the agricultural leap forward plan of increasing grain production by 2.8 billion catties in 1958 with 120,000 points of enthusiasm.

    All Aspects of Work Must Leap Forward to Keep Up with and Support the Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production

　　(5) We must mobilize the forces of all aspects to vigorously support the great leap forward in agricultural production. At the same time, in industry and other production, urban work and other work, there should also be a great leap forward and great development in order to keep up with the great leap forward in agricultural production. At present, urban work is also lagging behind the masses and thinking lagging behind the situation. Therefore, we must resolutely reverse the right-leaning conservative thinking in work, vigorously develop industry and handicrafts, commerce, transportation, and various production and construction undertakings, actively cooperate with and support the great leap forward in agricultural production, revise conservative plans, improve low-quality products, reduce expensive costs, earnestly reverse waste in all aspects, and support agriculture with practical actions. At the same time, urban residents and government employees can also be organized to eliminate the four pests, participate in voluntary labor to improve environmental sanitation and urban construction in their spare time, and do their best to support rural construction of agricultural water conservancy and accumulation of fertilizer. Because the development of agriculture is a major matter directly related to everyone's eating and clothing, everyone's life is inseparable from agriculture, and everyone should fulfill their responsibility for the development of agriculture.

　　Leaders at all levels must deeply organize and lead production, comprehensively organize close cooperation between various production and construction undertakings, so that they cooperate with and promote each other, and concentrate the will of millions of masses and the motivation of all aspects under a great goal that is most easy to mobilize the masses, and act with overwhelming momentum and enthusiasm to turn the slogan of "grain output of 1,000 catties per mu, pond fish 700 catties, and sugarcane 10,000 catties" into reality, and strive to complete and over-fulfill the National Agricultural Development Program and the province's twelve-year agricultural construction plan!

　　有信心有把握实现千斤省
    区梦觉代表介绍广东发展农业生产情况
    我完全拥护李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任向大会所作的报告。现在我就广东省发展农业生产的主要情况发表一些意见。
    农业生产的伟大成绩
    粮食生产取得巨大胜利  经济作物生产突飞猛进
    随着全国一九五七年国民经济计划的超额完成，全国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，已经全面地超额完成了。广东人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，在执行第一个五年计划的斗争中，获得了巨大的成绩，特别是在贯彻以农业生产为重点，在农业生产中又以发展粮食生产为主同时发展各种经济作物和林业、畜牧业、水产业的方针方面，更是获得了辉煌的成就。从一九五三年开始，五年来，全省广大的农民由个体经济走上了社会主义的合作化的道路，在胜利完成对农业的社会主义改造，基本实现了高级化之后，农业生产有了令人振奋的跃进，这首先表现在：全省农民突出地以史无前例的规模掀起了群众性的兴修农田水利运动，完成了排灌面积两千零九十万亩和培修堤防六千万土（石）方，使全省百分之七十的农田有了排灌设备，一千五百五十二万亩耕地消灭了旱灾，这对农作物的增产起着带有关键性的作用；粮食作物的复种指数也大有增加，已经从百分之一百八十扩大到百分之二百，冬种面积已经由九百万亩扩大到一千七百万亩；全省已有百分之九十左右的稻田推行了以小株密植为中心的一套先进的水稻种植方法和耕作技术。所有这些，使得全省的粮食比一九五二年增产五十六亿斤，增长了百分之三十，比解放前增产八十五亿斤，增长了百分之五十以上，单位面积产量由一九四九年的三百五十斤提高到五百一十斤。一九五六年全省出现了六个粮食千斤县、五百九十二个千斤乡、三千六百九十九个千斤社。一九五七年又出现了化县那鄱社两造亩产两千六百六十三斤稻谷的高额丰产田，澄海县更有两千亩耕地亩产三千斤（包括一造稻谷一造番薯折谷部分）大面积的丰产田。由于粮食生产上取得了巨大的胜利，这就有可能在这个基础上开展多种经营，全面发展生产。经济作物的总产量也有巨大的增长，除蚕桑之外，产量都大大超过战前水平。经济作物和热带作物种植面积已经由九百五十万亩扩大到一千五百二十五万亩，比解放前扩大百分之六十一，特别是蔗糖生产更是突飞猛进，全省已由解放初期的年产两万四千吨增加到年产四十万吨，曾出现了亩产甘蔗两万九千斤的高产纪录；蚕桑也出现了亩产七千二百九十斤桑叶的高产纪录。造林工作也取得了巨大成绩，五年中共造林两千零九十万亩，超过中央下达计划一点六倍。海水和淡水渔业的总产量一九五二年只有三十三万五千吨，一九五七年已经增至六十二万吨，超过战前四十八万吨的最高水平；塘鱼出现了亩产一千九百五十四斤的最高纪录。养猪业亦有了很大发展，生猪由一九五二年六百五十五万头增至八百一十万头，全省七百五十万农户，平均每户养猪一头多，而养猪最多的乐昌县大富社平均每户达十三头。随着农业生产的大发展，为本省工业生产的大跃进提供了可靠的物质基础，工业生产总值已经超额完成了第一个五年计划的指标，由一九四九年的四亿六千万多元增至一九五七年预计达到的二十五亿一千万元，增长了四倍多，比一九五二年的工业总产值亦增长一点二九倍，平均每年的增长速度为百分之一十八。在全部工业总产值中，依靠农业提供原料的，占百分之七十以上。这就是说，如果没有农业生产的大发展要工业生产大跃进是不可能的。其他文教、卫生、交通、邮电、财经、贸易等工作也有了相应地发展，并获得了巨大成绩。
    应该肯定：农业生产上所取得的巨大成绩是和农业社会主义改造方面的伟大胜利分不开的。一九五五年冬季和一九五六年春季，广东和全国一样，在全省范围内突破了右倾保守思想的束缚，出现了农业合作化的高潮，有百分之九十五的农户参加了农业生产合作社，这就使三千万农民摆脱了资本主义旧道路，走上了社会主义的新道路；土改以后的两极分化趋势被共同富裕的前途所代替，成为整个农村历史发展道路的新的起点。合作社一经建立，就显示了巨大的优越性，一九五五年冬到一九五六年上半年即掀起了史无前例的生产大高潮，修建了受益一千万亩的水利工程，积集了二十四亿担肥料，战胜了数十年未遇的自然灾害，在短短的几个月里做了许多过去几辈子都做不了的工作，从而使一九五六年农作物获得空前丰收。在农业合作社增产的基础上，社员的收入亦逐年有所增加，目前全省有百分之三十五至四十的农户（二百六十七万至三百五十万户）和百分之二十左右的合作社已经赶上了或者超过了上中农的生产与收入水平。
    右倾保守思想曾经一度出现  给去年生产和工作造成损失
    但是，在一九五六年下半年到一九五七年上半年，农业生产上曾经出现一股右倾保守思想的逆流。主要表现在：有些人对合作制度的伟大生命力和集体农民的强大力量不够信任，对农业生产发展抱消极态度，缺乏勇于克服困难的革命精神和干劲，不仅对于新生的合作社和农业生产上的巨大成绩不给予鼓励和支持，反而诸多责难、挑剔和夸大缺点，否定成绩，并说是“冒进”。他们对于在优先发展粮食生产，集中力量解决粮食问题，消除紧张的同时，曾经一度对小量的经济作物注意不够的缺点，采取非议的态度，大肆攻击本省的农业生产方针；对于为了搞好农田水利建设的百年大计和突击积肥运动，曾因劳动力投放大，一度影响了一点副业生产，进行责难；对于在推行农业增产措施和技术改革方面取得巨大成绩的同时，有一小部分因条件不具备或质量不合规格而引起的缺点，也不加分析，而抹杀成绩；甚至把农民在加入合作社以后不可避免地暂时存在着的一些困难，也归咎于采取了革命精神发展农业生产。他们夸大农民生活的困难情况，把农村形容成漆黑一团；完全不懂得在经济制度和社会生产上的伟大变革中，领导和群众由于缺乏经验，在某些方面存在若干缺点是完全难以避免的，其实这也是正常的现象。必须肯定：我们所要克服的仅仅是工作中，特别是领导工作中的一些主观主义、官僚主义作风，而对于广大干部和群众的革命朝气和创造精神，却要加以保护和百倍发扬。不加分析地一概否定，其结果对于那种可贵的热情和有益的创举起着极坏的泼冷水的作用，只能是把革命精神反掉，增加束手束脚、畏首畏尾、不敢大胆前进的保守倾向。这种右倾保守思想给一九五七年的生产和工作所造成的损失，是我们必须深刻记取的教训。
    农业建设十二年规划
    中共八届三中全会指出，我国经济建设方针，必须是“在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工农业同时并举的方针”。这一方针是完全正确的，也是完全适合广东具体情况的。为了坚定不移地贯彻执行这一方针，为了保证全国农业发展纲要在广东省实现，并力争提前实现，广东决定第二个五年计划以至第三个五年计划期间，仍以发展农业生产为重点，在发展粮食生产为主的同时，发展经济作物和林业、畜牧业、水产业。在发展农业的同时，积极发展轻工业、食品工业、盐业、有色金属和相应地大力发展为农业生产服务与农业生产密切关联着的化学肥料工业、农业机器制造业及农产品加工业，以及交通事业等等。并且根据这个精神和全国农业发展纲要的要求，制定了本省农业建设十二年规划，作为全省人民行动的纲领。
    1962年粮食亩产八百斤  1967年实现粮食千斤省
    广东省农业建设十二年规划要求粮食每亩平均产量由一九五五年的四百四十斤到一九六二年达到八百斤，到一九六七年达到一千斤，实现粮食千斤省，总产量则由二百一十八亿斤增加到四百八十亿斤；经济作物由现有七百万亩的种植面积，扩大到两千六百万亩（全部靠开荒和向丘陵、山区发展），主要经济作物：甘蔗将增加五倍多，蚕桑增加十几倍，各种水果均有几倍的增加；生猪由现在的社会存量八百万头，增加到三千万头（全年饲养量四千五百万头）；水产业由一九五七年的年产六十二万吨，发展到二百五十万吨。两年内全省消灭旱灾，五年内消灭普通水灾、完成绿化，还分别规定在若干年内消灭虫害，农业生产逐步实现机械化，建成水陆运输网，消灭四害，扫除文盲，普及小学教育等。无疑的，农业的发展势必将会推动工业的更快的发展，仅就本省制糖工业一项，就可以由现在的年产四十万吨，发展到二百五十万吨以上。而制糖过程中有三种大量而又有极大经济价值的副产品：蔗渣、废糖蜜、滤坭。如果到一九六二年本省年产糖达到一百二十万吨，可得蔗渣二百万吨，用来制纸，可产八十七万五千吨纸，成本较机械木纸便宜百分之二十五，较漂白苇浆纸则低三倍之多；蔗渣如全部用作制造人造纤维，每年亦可产二十万吨纤维，可抵一千万亩棉田的皮棉产量，可制纱一百万件，制成的棉布全国每人可有二公尺。上述这些副产品的利用，如果能够实现，那无论对物资生产，对资金积累都有极重要的意义。因此，除本省责成有关部门组织力量专门规划研究外，望中央能在技术上给以大力支持，并望将制糖副产品利用的方针能早日确定下来。到那时候，广东全省每人平均将有一千斤粮食、一头猪、一百多斤鱼、几十棵果树、一百多斤糖，我们便能以更多的食品物资来供应全国的需要。
    不断掀起生产高潮  有把握有信心实现规划
    我省十二年农业建设规划，经过全省各地展开讨论，认为到一九六七年实现粮食“千斤省”是有把握、有信心的。这不仅是由于广东省的自然条件比较优越，广大农民有勤劳俭朴、精耕细作的传统，而更重要的是有了比较巩固的合作化基础，有了两年来的组织集体生产和经营管理的经验。近半年来的农村社会主义教育和民主整社运动，大大提高了群众的觉悟水平，改进了合作社的经营管理工作，使农村社会主义阵地取得了更加巩固的绝对优势，为实现十二年规划提供了可靠的政治保证。而这一、两年来所创造的许多高额丰产范例，又为努力争取大面积的高额丰产树立了活的榜样。同时，随着国家工业的飞跃发展，今后十年内科学技术水平将有迅速的提高，也必然给农业生产的发展以极大的推动。当然，自然条件和工作基础都只能是为完成和超额完成增产任务提供了可能，更重要的还须靠我们在中共中央和国务院的领导下，调动一切积极因素，组织和带领全省人民群众，鼓足干劲扎扎实实地、勤勤恳恳地做好各个方面的工作，不断掀起一个接着一个的生产高潮，促使整个工农业生产的大跃进。
    完成各项任务的措施
    为了提前完成全国农业发展纲要和本省十二年农业建设规划的各项任务，我们认为必须努力做好下面的工作。
    继续以发展农业为重点  同时积极发展工业和其他事业
    （一）必须坚定不移地在五年至十年期间内，继续贯彻以发展农业为重点同时还要积极发展轻工业、食品工业、盐业、有色金属业、化肥工业、农业机械制造业、农产品加工业以及交通运输业等的既定方针。实践证明：我国农业社会主义改造的高潮，推动和加速了手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造；而农业生产的大跃进又势必直接和间接促使了工业及其他生产建设事业的大跃进。特别是本省的工业主要是轻工业、食品工业和一部分与农业有密切关系的重工业，它们的发展在极大程度上取决于农业的发展。从本省第一个五年计划执行的结果来看，正是由于大力发展农业，才为工业发展提供了原料的保证和出口物资的供应。因此，只有继续集中最大力量发展农业，同时十分努力发展地方工业，才能更好地支援国家工业建设，并从根本上改变广东的面貌。
    不断地反对右倾保守思想  鼓起巨大的持久的革命干劲
    （二）必须继续不断地反对右倾保守思想，鼓起一股巨大的持久的革命干劲，首先一定要在两年之内消灭本省旱灾，争取第二个五年计划期间内基本消灭普通水灾。几年来的实践经验证明：在发展农业生产上，先进思想和右倾保守思想一直在顽强地斗争着，取得生产大跃进的过程也就是突破和挣脱右倾保守思想束缚的过程。而在今天，这种先进与落后的斗争则表现得更为尖锐和深刻。那些认为“农业生产只能渐进，不能跃进”、“生产已到顶无潜力可挖”等等陈旧的观念，已经成了农业生产跃进发展的大敌。本省一九五七年天时和其他方面条件虽好过一九五六年，而实际增产的粮食却大大少于一九五六年的教训，完全说明了这个问题。而全省在贯彻了中共八届三中全会精神，批判了右倾保守思想和肯定、总结与推广各地以生动的革命精神创造的宝贵经验之后，广大群众又热情高涨、精力充沛、干劲十足，立即掀起了一个以兴修农田水利为中心的冬季生产高潮。在这方面，本省阳江县海陵岛区创造了生动的战胜旱灾的范例。这个小岛孤悬大海，岛上没有河流，遍地沙滩，但是，这里的群众和干部以“愚公移山”的精神挖塘蓄水，中共区委会成了“打平塘的区委会”，设在工程最紧张、最困难的前沿阵地，同群众一起苦干了七十个日日夜夜，一举而基本上解决了水利问题，粮食亩产量由三百斤一跃而为六百斤。像海陵岛这样困难的地区可以做到的事情，本省其他地区是没有理由做不到的。事实上，群众一经发动起来，无穷的智慧马上就显示了威力，突破一切人力、物力、财力上的困难，做出惊人的业绩。惠阳县沥林乡创造了在丘陵地把引水和蓄水结合起来，使坡、塘、圳等农田水利工程联成一个既是小型又是统一的自流灌溉系统的经验，这里的群众经过筑坡引水、环山开渠、坡地筑塘、渠塘相通、引蓄结合的苦战几年，彻底消灭了旱灾。这种统一规划、分批兴修、互相联系的小型水利工程，不仅是投资少，而且收效快，为提前在二年内消灭旱灾创造了榜样和方向。其次，改变肥料不足状况，建立可靠肥源。全省到一九六二年养猪可发展到两千八百万头，这可以解决一半粮食耕地面积的肥料。在这方面，本省南海县红旗农业合作社和乐昌县大富农业合作社创造了多养猪、多积肥、多增产的经验和新会县龙榜一社的大力积集与充分利用农家肥的经验，都正在全省推广传播。到一九六二年，还可种植冬种绿肥一千万亩，加上本省生产化肥五十万吨，另有大量塘、海、河泥及其他土杂肥亦可增积。第三，改造落后田与全部施行新的农业技术改革。目前，全省产量在四百斤以下的低产田约有一千八百万亩，在三、五年内，通过改良土壤，增施肥料与改善栽培方法，要求每亩平均产量提高到六百斤以上是完全可以的。第四，基本实现“一年三熟”。这是本省农业生产达到高额产量，提高土地利用率的一项主要措施。包括上述内容的农业关，如果在三、五年内能够跨过或争取提前跨过，那么，广东的农业生产就可以在比较稳妥可靠的基础上，大踏步地向前跃进。
    把民主整社形成制度  并结合进行社会主义教育
    （三）必须不断地进行民主整社和社会主义教育。宣传勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家、勤劳生产，通过如何建设社会主义的大辩论，转变社会风气，树立勤劳节俭、艰苦奋斗精神。农业合作化之后，虽然从经济上改变了农业生产资料的所有制，但是，社会主义思想尚未完全树立，资本主义自发倾向仍然严重存在。尤其是在富裕中农当中，除了一部分有觉悟的以外，相当一部分对社会主义还持动摇态度，留恋走资本主义道路。一部分社员在富裕中农的思想影响之下，不愿意参加合作社的集体生产，只顾扩大个人的家庭副业；不愿意增加合作社的公共积累，只愿意分光、吃光；不愿意把肥料卖给合作社，只愿积极扩大自留地生产，等等。所有这些，都严重影响了合作社的巩固和生产的发展。经过了几个月的民主整社与社会主义教育，这种情况已得到很大转变。经验证明，不论是从思想上、政治上、经济上都还要经过比较长期的努力，才能彻底把合作社巩固起来。因此，今后必须把民主整社形成制度化，一年或半年整顿一次合作社，并且把社会主义教育密切和整社工作结合起来经常进行。在经济上，则通过扩大公共积累，壮大集体经济，增加基本建设，改善劳动管理，在稳定现有粮食种植面积、不断提高单位面积产量的前提下，开展多种经营，大力发展牧畜业，开发山区、丘陵，广辟生产门路，不断提高合作社的经营管理水平，认真贯彻民主办社和勤俭办社的方针，争取在三年之内，使合作社的生产与社员的收入水平均赶上或超过当地上中农的水平，真正从政治上、经济上彻底把合作社巩固下来，为农业生产大跃进奠定牢固的政治基础和物质基础。
    搞好当前冬季生产打好第一仗
    （四）必须切实搞好当前冬季生产，为一九五八年农业生产大跃进和全面大丰收打好第一个战役。目前，本省参加冬季生产的劳动力已经达到一千五百万人，占全省总农业人口百分之五十，其中有九百万人投入兴修农田水利工程，经过了反对右倾保守思想和进一步挖掘潜力，兴修水利之受益面积计划已由五百多万亩提高到两千万亩，其中投资二十万元和受益面积在一万亩以上的工程就有一百六十六宗。而像这样的工程，在解放前全省只有一宗，解放八年来也只兴修了一百四十宗。目前全年计划兴修的大、中型水利已经全部开工，在春节前，中、小型水利可以基本完工，大型水利至少可以完成百分之八十。本省全年积肥计划原为五十七亿担，现在提高到一百二十亿担，每亩平均一百二十担，春耕前要求最少完成七十亿担，积肥最多的潮安县，每亩平均已达二百二十担。还要求改良土壤、造林各一千万亩，直播造林已经开始，冬种作物已经超额完成了两千万亩的计划。冬季生产运动正在全省农村的各个角落里蓬勃地开展着，而且进行得早，声势大，劲头足，信心高，进展快，成绩显著。但是，必须清醒地看到，这仅仅是个开端，还必须鼓起更大劲头，在取得胜利的基础上争取更大的胜利，跃进再跃进，高潮更高潮，今年可以办到的事情决不推到明年去做，以十二万分的劲头，坚决实现一九五八年增产粮食二十八亿斤的农业跃进计划。
    各方面工作都要大跃进  跟上和支援农业生产的大跃进
    （五）必须调动各个方面的力量来大力支援农业生产的大跃进，同时，在工业及其他生产、城市工作及其他工作方面，亦应该来一个大跃进、大发展，以便跟上农业生产的大跃进。目前城市工作同样是领导落后于群众、思想落后于形势，所以，也必须坚决反掉工作中的右倾保守思想，大力发展工业及手工业、商业、交通运输业及各项生产建设事业，积极配合与支援农业生产大跃进，计划保守的要修订，质量低劣的要提高，成本昂贵的要降低，认真反掉各个方面的浪费，以实际行动支援农业。同时，还可以组织城市居民、机关工作人员等做到人人除四害，利用业余时间参加改善环境卫生和城市建设的义务劳动，并尽力地支援农村兴修农田水利、积集肥料。因为发展农业是直接关系着所有的人吃饭、穿衣的大事情，人人生活都离不开农业，人人对农业的发展也就应当尽到自己的一份责任。
    各级领导必须深入组织和领导生产，全面地组织各项生产建设事业之间的密切协作，使之互相配合、互相推动，把千百万群众的意志、把各个方面的动力集中到一个最容易调动群众的伟大目标下，以排山倒海的声势和劲头行动起来，把“亩产粮食一千斤、塘鱼七百斤、甘蔗一万斤”的口号变成现实，为完成和超额完成全国农业发展纲要和本省十二年农业建设规划而奋斗！
