Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 7th: A grand celebration meeting was held in the Moranbong Theater in Pyongyang tonight to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army.

Korean state leaders including Premier Kim Il-sung of the Cabinet and Chairman Choi Yong-kun of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly attended the meeting. Also participating were leaders of various democratic parties and social organizations in Korea, representatives of the working people of Pyongyang, senior generals and officers of the Korean People's Army, combat heroes, and diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Korea.

The delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, led by Commander General Yang Yong and Political Commissar General Wang Ping, was invited to attend the meeting.

General Kim Kwang-hyup, Minister of National Defence of Korea, delivered a report at the commemorative meeting. He reviewed the glorious history of the Korean People's Army over the past ten years since its founding and the merits it had established in various revolutionary periods. He said that during the Korean War, under the correct strategic guidance of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean People's Army closely coordinated with the Chinese People's Volunteers to defeat the American aggressors, defend the revolutionary democratic base of the Republic, and achieve a historic victory. Through this war, the Korean People's Army proved through its heroic struggle that it is an armed force loyal to the Workers' Party and the government of the Republic, and a reliable and invincible army for defending the socialist motherland and the people. Kim Kwang-hyup pointed out that the reason why the Korean People's Army has been able to withstand various tests and move towards victory in the arduous struggle against enemies at home and abroad is that it is a new type of army armed with Marxist-Leninist theory and proletarian internationalist spirit under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party. It also inherited the revolutionary patriotic traditions of the anti-Japanese guerrillas.

Kim Kwang-hyup condemned the American aggressors' provocative acts of seriously threatening peace by bringing atomic weapons into South Korea and conducting atomic warfare exercises near the military demarcation line. He said that the Korean people will never allow such provocative acts by the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee clique, and will certainly repel their conspiracies and realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Kim Kwang-hyup emphasized that all the Korean people unanimously support the statement issued by the Republic's government on the 5th and are striving to realize the propositions put forward in this statement. He pointed out that U.S. troops stationed in Korea should immediately withdraw from South Korea. He said that the government of the Republic has reduced its military strength by 80,000 troops in order to promote a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The South Korean authorities should immediately respond to the legitimate proposal of the Republic's government regarding the reduction of the armed forces of North and South Korea.

Kim Kwang-hyup emphasized that the Korean People's Army must vigilantly defend the fruits of socialism and strive to strengthen combat political training and improve combat effectiveness.

General Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, then delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting.

General Yang Yong said: For more than four years since the armistice, the Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, have been guarding the line of peace and have been striving for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The statement issued by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5 fully demonstrates the peace aspirations of the Korean people, and this is another major effort by the Government of the Republic to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The Chinese People's Volunteers fully support this peace initiative. General Yang Yong said that the Chinese government officially issued a statement on February 7, fully agreeing with and fully supporting this major peace initiative of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Chinese government stated in the statement: "The Chinese government believes that all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea on a regular basis, and the Chinese government is prepared to consult with the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the issue of the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea." The Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely support this statement by our government.

General Yang Yong said that the Chinese People's Volunteers deeply cherish the combat friendship between us and the Korean People's Army, and we must learn well the fine style of the Korean People's Army; we will always be with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army to defend world peace and strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 8th: General Kim Kwang-hyup, Minister of National Defence of Korea, issued an order to all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army on February 8, the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army.

The order stated that in the ten years since the founding of the Korean People's Army, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic, it has grown into a modern and regular army. The order requires all officers and soldiers of the People's Army to vigorously support the policies of the Party and the government, vigilantly defend the achievements of the people in building socialism and the territory of the Republic, and actively fight to safeguard peace in Korea.

The order requires all officers and soldiers of the People's Army to constantly monitor the enemy's actions, do a good job in combat and political training, and defend the motherland like a copper wall and iron bastion.

The order requires officers and soldiers of the People's Army to arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism, patriotism, and proletarian internationalism, and further promote the revolutionary patriotic tradition. The order also requires officers and soldiers of the People's Army to strive to strengthen the flesh-and-blood relationship between the army and the people, and to further strengthen internationalist unity with the people of socialist countries.
