Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 22nd - According to TASS, Stockholm, 22nd: Swedish Prime Minister Erlander said on the 21st that he supports holding a high-level meeting and establishing a nuclear weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

Erlander said to reporters upon his return from London that he hoped the high-level meeting would lead to a ban on atomic weapons testing and universal disarmament throughout the world—including Sweden. He said that Sweden's military budget for the next year would reach 2.7 billion kronor, a significant expenditure for a small country like Sweden. He said: If the high-level meeting can achieve success on any one point, it will be of tremendous significance in the current international situation.

Erlander also said: The Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear weapon-free zone in Central Europe must be taken seriously. Major powers should seriously discuss this proposal.
