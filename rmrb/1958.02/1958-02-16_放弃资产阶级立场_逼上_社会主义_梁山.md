Abandoning the Bourgeois Standpoint: "Forced" onto the Socialist "Mount Liang"
Representative Liu Shuzhou Discusses the Transformation of Intellectuals

Some intellectuals in an intermediate state say: Intellectuals have neither enterprises nor land, so where does the bourgeois label come from? On the surface, it seems like they are only arguing about a label, but in essence, the focus of the debate is whether or not to transform.

I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

Our Shanghai representatives, after discussion and soliciting opinions from the Shanghai Party and government leading organs, unanimously believe that the tasks assigned to Shanghai by the central government in the 1958 national budget and national economic plan can not only be completed according to plan, but also are determined to do everything possible to increase production, practice strict economy, and oppose waste in order to strive to turn over an additional 500 million yuan to the national treasury this year. Currently, all the people of Shanghai are striving with full confidence and enthusiasm to achieve this glorious goal.

Our confidence comes from the ever-increasing enthusiasm and creativity of the people of Shanghai in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Like all parts of the country, a socialist construction competition is in full swing in Shanghai. In industry and transportation alone, 700,000 employees are currently involved in the battle. The slogans of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and the advanced becoming even more advanced have become mass battle slogans. Representative Zhang Qi has already given a brief report to the conference on this situation, so I will not repeat it here. On the agricultural front, farmers in the suburbs are also fighting to basically realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule during the Second Five-Year Plan, and they will conduct some effective experiments in agricultural mechanization and electrification to gain some experience. Under the impact of the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm, many things that were usually considered impossible have become relatively easy to do today; many things that seemed very difficult have been solved today after some effort. However, in the past, we also had a period where we excessively called out difficulties and asked for solutions from higher levels. We did not conduct specific analyses of the difficulties, nor did we fully tap the enormous potential for overcoming difficulties hidden in the masses. Moreover, we often used "routine" to bind ourselves and forced the masses to act according to the old almanac. When a movement came, some of our comrades often did not stand in front of the masses to lead them forward, but stood beside the masses, gesticulating and whispering. They even regarded the necessary revolutionary spirit and revolutionary speed as "rash advances" and "a fondness for greatness and eagerness for success." After this great rectification movement, we initially reversed the right-leaning conservative sentiment and overcame the bureaucratic style of following the rules; this allowed the broad masses of cadres to realize that the ever-increasing revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is an inexhaustible source for overcoming all difficulties. As long as we do not forget Chairman Mao's teachings, do not deviate from the masses for a moment, and bravely stand at the forefront of the high tide to lead the masses forward, our struggle will surely be invincible.

After the rectification and anti-Rightist campaigns, the proportion of leftists and middle-leftists among Shanghai's intellectuals has risen from about 20 percent to about 35 percent, but there are still some intellectuals in an intermediate state who talk about transformation but act differently, with inconsistency between words and deeds, and are unwilling to open their hearts.

Now, I would like to talk about a few points on the issue of the socialist transformation of intellectuals. Shanghai is a city with a large concentration of intellectuals. This vigorous socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has once again posed to all bourgeois intellectuals: only by thoroughly transforming themselves, wholeheartedly integrating with workers and peasants, serving the working people, and serving the socialist economic base, is their only path. Like other places, after a profound rectification and anti-Rightist struggle, the tendency for bourgeois intellectuals in Shanghai to turn to the left is very obvious. According to rough surveys, the proportion of leftists and middle-leftists among them has risen from about 20 percent at the beginning of the rectification to about 35 percent now. Even those who are still in an intermediate state can now mostly draw a clear line of demarcation between themselves and the Rightists in politics; the enthusiasm for accepting socialist transformation has increased to varying degrees. Many people are continuing to work hard, determined to transform themselves into worker-class intellectuals who are both red and expert; some have enthusiastically signed up in response to the Party's call to go to the mountains and countryside to participate in labor training; some have already formulated realistic self-transformation plans; and some scientific and technical personnel have actively plunged into the high tide of production. All these tremendous changes and progress are encouraging. However, on the other hand, there are still some intellectuals in an intermediate state who despise the working people, are half-hearted about the socialist cause, have no feelings for it, and even have great resistance; in the depths of their souls, they still cling to bankrupt bourgeois individualism, are preoccupied with personal fame and gain while flaunting their integrity, are always incompatible with collectivism, and even disgusted by it; they think they have knowledge, the country cannot do without them, they always want to be superior to others, unwilling to undergo a thorough transformation. Some people are very dissatisfied with the term "bourgeois intellectuals," they say: Intellectuals have neither enterprises nor land, so where does the bourgeois label come from? On the surface, it seems like they are only arguing about a label, but in reality, as one professor said, the focus of the debate is whether or not to transform. It reflects the unwillingness of some intellectuals to accept defeat to the working people. Among them, there are still some people who, driven by the situation, also talk about transformation, but they do not agree with it in their hearts, with inconsistency between words and deeds. They do not adopt an honest attitude and are unwilling to open their hearts, always wanting to put on a good show and muddle through. These situations show that the current ideological state of intellectuals is far from meeting the requirements of the new situation of the leap forward era, and far from meeting the historical tasks that intellectuals should shoulder.

As long as intellectuals are determined to put down their airs and honestly work hard in the direction pointed out by the Party, they can be completely transformed successfully. The key lies in whether or not they are willing to "bow their heads" to the working people and whether or not they are willing to be "oxen."

We believe that the situation of the socialist revolution today is: in the international situation, the East wind prevails over the West wind; domestically, after the basic transformation of capitalist ownership and individual ownership, bourgeois intellectuals have lost their old economic base on which they depended; the construction cause of the working class is leaping forward, our country is truly a garden full of spring, with a myriad of phenomena, a scene of prosperity. At the same time, with the deepening of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, the struggle between the two classes and the two roads, who will win and who will lose, has become clear. History has seriously posed this question to all those in an intermediate state: should they follow the working class and bravely advance towards socialism, or should they muddle along, cling to the old and refuse to let go, and be willing to be thrown behind by history? Now is the time to answer. We sincerely hope that all patriotic intellectuals will immediately abandon the bourgeois standpoint, take advantage of the unstoppable revolutionary situation, and be "forced" onto the socialist "Mount Liang." It's either this or that, either advance or retreat, there is no other way.

For the majority of bourgeois intellectuals, the fundamental transformation of political standpoint is not impossible. As long as they are determined, put down their airs, and honestly work hard in the direction guided by the Party, it is entirely possible to transform successfully. Let us take Mr. Lu Xun as an example. Lu Xun was originally also a bourgeois intellectual, "later, due to the lessons of facts, he believed that only the emerging proletarians had a future" ("Two Hearts Collection"); he not only verbally acknowledged that "only the emerging proletarians have a future," but also used the practical action of "fierce-browed, I coolly face a thousand pointing fingers, head bowed, I willingly serve the children as an ox" to wholeheartedly serve the proletariat. This made Mr. Lu Xun finally become a shining example for intellectuals. It can be seen from this that whether or not they are willing to "bow their heads" to the working people and whether or not they are willing to be "oxen" is the key for intellectuals to achieve transformation. If they are unwilling to make a great determination, unwilling to be the "oxen" of the working people, or even unwilling to jump down from the back of the ox, then no matter how many beautiful words they say, they cannot truly and thoroughly transform themselves.

The five preliminary goals of self-transformation for intellectuals proposed at the Shanghai Municipal Congress of the Communist Party of China are very important, and we are willing to work together with intellectual friends in Shanghai to achieve these goals.

Our Party has always adhered to the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, and warmly caring for the progress of intellectuals. At the major historical juncture of the socialist revolution, the Party has once again pointed out the path for intellectuals to transform themselves. At the Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai, held not long ago, in order to help intellectuals in Shanghai find a way to transform themselves through self-education, the following five preliminary goals were specifically proposed: (1) support the leadership of the Communist Party; (2) firmly and actively take the socialist road; (3) gradually become one with workers, peasants, and soldiers; (4) correctly handle the contradictions between personal interests and collective interests and national interests; (5) work hard to study politics, actively delve into professional work, and constantly demand progress. Strive to ensure that leftists and middle-leftists among senior intellectuals in Shanghai can account for more than 60 percent within five years. We believe that this is a very important and serious political task, and we are willing to work together with intellectual friends in Shanghai to achieve this goal.

We know that intellectuals are not without pain in the process of self-transformation, but this is a phenomenon that inevitably occurs in the process of any new negation of the old qualitative change. Only by burning the old can the new be produced. Since this is the case, we should not regard this change as a painful thing, but should feel happy. Only by being ruthless to the old can we be affectionate to the new. For the sake of one's own rebirth, what shortcomings cannot be discarded? We hope that intellectuals who are determined to transform themselves will summon up the courage to learn from Mr. Lu Xun's spirit of daring to dissect themselves at all times in front of millions of readers and strive to transform themselves!

    放弃资产阶级立场　“逼上”社会主义“梁山”
    刘述周代表谈知识分子改造问题
    有一部分中间状态的知识分子说：知识分子一无企业，二无地皮，资产阶级这顶帽子从何而来？表面上看来好像只是在争一顶帽子，实质上争的焦点是要不要改造。
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告。
    我们上海市的代表，经过讨论，并且征求了上海党政领导机关的意见之后，一致认为中央交给上海市的一九五八年国家预算和国民经济计划的任务，不仅可以按计划完成，而且决心要千方百计从增加生产、厉行节约、反对浪费等方面，争取今年超额上缴国库五亿元。目前全上海人民，正在满怀信心、鼓足干劲为实现这个光荣的目标而一致奋斗。
    我们的信心，来自日益增长的上海人民群众的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的积极性和创造性。同全国各地一样，上海全市社会主义建设竞赛已经热火朝天。单在工业和交通方面，目前已有七十万职工卷入了战斗。比先进、学先进、赶先进和先进再先进的口号，已成为群众性的战斗口号。关于这方面的情况，张祺代表已经向大会作了简略的汇报，我这里不再讲了。在农业战线上，郊区的农民，也正为争取提前在第二个五年计划期间基本上实现全国农业发展纲要而斗争，并且要在农业机械化、电气化方面进行一些有成效的试验，取得一些经验。在群众革命热情冲击之下，许多平时认为做不到的事情，今天比较容易地做到了；许多看来很困难的事情，今天经过一番努力也就解决了。然而，在过去，我们也曾经有一个时期，过多地向上级叫困难、要办法。对困难不进行具体的分析，也没有充分地去发掘群众中蕴藏着的克服困难的巨大潜力。而且还常常以“常规”来束缚自己，强制群众按老皇历办事。运动来了，我们有些同志往往不是站在群众的前面，领导群众前进，而是站在群众旁边，指手划脚，窃窃私议。甚至把必须的革命气概和革命速度，看作是“冒进”，看作是“好大喜功”。经过这次伟大的整风运动，初步扭转了右倾保守情绪，克服了按部就班的“官气”；这才使广大干部体会到群众中日益高涨的革命积极性，是克服一切困难的无尽源泉，只要我们不忘记毛主席的教导，一刻也不脱离群众，勇敢地站到高潮的前列，领导群众前进，我们的斗争就一定能够所向披靡，无往不利。
    经过整风和反右，上海的知识分子中的左派和中左分子的比重已由百分之二十上升到百分之三十五左右，但仍有一部分中间状态的知识分子，口头讲要改造，可是言行不一，表里两端，不肯把心交出来。
    现在，我想就知识分子的社会主义改造问题谈谈几点意见。上海是大量知识分子集中的一个城市。这次轰轰烈烈的政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，再次向所有资产阶级知识分子提出了：只有彻底改造自己，全心全意与工农结合，为劳动人民服务，为社会主义的经济基础服务，才是他们唯一的道路。上海同各地一样，资产阶级知识分子经过一场深刻的整风和反右派斗争以后，向左转化的趋向是很明显的。根据粗略的调查，他们当中的左派和中左分子的比重，已经从整风开始时的百分之二十左右上升到现在的百分之三十五左右，即使仍然处在中间状态的人，现在大多数也能在政治上和右派划清敌我界线；接受社会主义改造的积极性，有了不同程度的增长。不少人正在继续努力，下决心把自己改造成又红又专的工人阶级知识分子；有些人踊跃报名，响应党的上山下乡、参加劳动锻炼的号召；有些人已经订出切实的自我改造的规划；还有一些科学技术人员积极地投入生产高潮之中。所有这些巨大的变化和进步都是令人鼓舞的。但是，从另一方面看，现在仍然有一部分中间状态的知识分子，卑视劳动人民，对社会主义事业三心二意，没有感情，甚至有很大的抵触情绪；他们在灵魂深处，仍然抱着破产了的资产阶级个人主义不放，斤斤计较个人的名利而又标榜清高，对集体主义总是格格不入，而且厌恶；他们自以为有知识，国家少不了他们，总想做人上人，高人一等，不愿脱胎换骨的改造自己。有些人对“资产阶级知识分子”这个提法很不满意，他们说：知识分子一无企业二无地皮，资产阶级这顶帽子从何而来？表面看好像只是在争一顶帽子，实际上正如一位教授所说的，争论的中心是要不要改造。它反映出一部分知识分子的不服气，不愿对劳动人民甘拜下风。他们中还有一部分人，在形势推动下，口头也讲要改造，可是心里不以为然，言行不一，表里两端。不是采取老老实实的态度，不肯把心交出来，总想粉饰太平，得过且过。这些情况说明当前知识分子的思想状况还远不能适应跃进时代新形势的要求，还远不能适应知识分子应该担当的历史任务。
    知识分子只要下定决心放下架子，老老实实朝着党所指的道路去努力，是完全可以改造成功的，关键在于对劳动人民肯不肯“俯首”，甘不甘心做“牛”。
    我们认为：今天社会主义革命的形势是：在国际形势上，东风压倒了西风；在国内，在基本上变革了资本主义所有制和个体所有制之后，资产阶级知识分子已丧失了依附的旧经济基础；工人阶级的建设事业正在向前跃进，我们的国家真是个满园春色，气象万千，一片欣欣向荣景象。同时，随着政治战线、思想战线上社会主义革命的深入，两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，谁胜谁负，已经初见分晓。历史向一切处在中间状态的人，严肃地提出了这样一个问题：还是跟着工人阶级一道奋勇向社会主义前进呢，还是苟且因循，抱残守缺，甘愿被抛在历史的后面呢？现在是必须做答案的时候了。我们热诚地希望一切爱国的知识分子，立即放弃资产阶级的立场，乘着不可遏制的革命形势，“逼上”社会主义的“梁山”。非此即彼，不进则退，此外是没有别的道路的。
    对大多数资产阶级知识分子来说，政治立场的根本改造，并不是不可能的。只要下定决心，放下架子，老老实实朝着党所指引的道路去努力，是完全有可能改造成功的。让我们把鲁迅先生作为例子。鲁迅原来也是一个资产阶级知识分子，“后来由于事实的教训，以为惟新兴的无产者才有将来”（“二心集”）；他不仅口头上承认“惟新兴的无产者才有将来”，而且是用“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”的实际行动全心全意地来为无产阶级服务。这就使鲁迅先生终于成为知识分子的光辉榜样。由此可见，对劳动人民肯不肯“俯首”，甘不甘心做“牛”，这是知识分子获得改造的关键。不肯下大决心，不肯做劳动人民的“牛”，甚至不愿意从牛背上跳下来，那么，漂亮话尽管说得再多，也不能真正彻底改造自己。
    中共上海市代表大会上提出的知识分子自我改造的五项初步目标，十分重要，愿意和上海市的知识分子朋友们一道努力实现这个目标。
    我们党一向坚持团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策，热情地关怀知识分子的进步。在社会主义革命的重大历史关头，党又一次地指出了知识分子自我改造的途径。在不久以前举行的中共上海市第一届代表大会第二次会议上，为了帮助上海的知识分子通过自我教育，找到自我改造的途径，特别提出了下列五项初步目标：（1）拥护共产党的领导；（2）坚定地积极地走社会主义道路；（3）逐步同工农兵打成一片；（4）正确处理个人利益同集体利益、国家利益的矛盾；（5）努力学习政治，积极钻研业务，不断要求进步。争取在五年内，上海市高级知识分子中的左派和中左分子能占百分之六十以上。我们认为这是一个十分重要的严肃的政治任务，我们愿意和上海的知识分子朋友们一道，努力实现这个目标。
    我们知道，知识分子在脱胎换骨的自我改造过程中，不是没有痛苦的，但是这是任何事物在新的否定旧的质变过程中必然产生的现象。只有烧掉旧的，才能产生新的。既然是这样，我们就不应该把这种变革看成是痛苦的事，而应该感到高兴。对旧的无情，方能对新的有情。为了自己的新生，有什么缺点不能丢掉呢？我们期望有决心改造自己的知识分子鼓起勇气，学习鲁迅先生的那种敢于在千百万读者面前，时时刻刻地解剖自己的精神，为改造自己而奋斗！
