Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 11th: Pyongyang newspapers report that the Association for Promoting Peaceful Reunification, composed of South Korean politicians residing in northern Korea, held a meeting on February 10th. Many South Korean politicians spoke at the meeting, unanimously supporting and welcoming the statements issued by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government of the People's Republic of China on February 5th and 7th respectively, regarding the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    Wu Xiaoying, a prominent South Korean politician and a member of the Supreme Committee of the Association for Promoting Peaceful Reunification, stated that the recent statement by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reflects the unified desire of the Korean people for peaceful reunification and is the most legitimate plan for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. There is no reason for the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique not to accept this plan. He said that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is the primary condition for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Korean issue can only be resolved by the Korean people themselves. He called on the brothers in South Korea to join the people in northern Korea in fighting for the implementation of the proposals put forward in this statement. Zhao Suang, another member of the Supreme Committee of the Association, said that the Chinese People's Volunteers aided the Korean people's struggle against aggression and have already withdrawn many troops from Korea. The Chinese government has issued a statement saying that it will discuss the withdrawal of the Volunteers with the Republic's government. Now the U.S. military has no reason or basis to continue to remain in South Korea.

    在北朝鲜的南朝鲜政治家
    拥护朝中政府的声明
    据新华社平壤11日电　平壤报纸报道，由在朝鲜北部的南朝鲜政治家组成的促进和平统一协议会10日举行会议。许多南朝鲜政治家在会上发言，一致支持和欢迎朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府分别在5日和7日就朝鲜的和平统一问题所发表的声明。
    著名的南朝鲜政治家、促进和平统一协议会最高委员吴夏英发言说，这次朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的声明反映了渴望和平统一的朝鲜民族的一致愿望，是和平统一祖国的最正当的方案。美国和李承晚集团没有理由不接受这个方案。他说，一切外国军队撤出朝鲜是和平解决朝鲜问题的首要条件。朝鲜问题只能由朝鲜人民自己来解决。他号召南朝鲜的兄弟同朝鲜北部人民一起为实现这个声明提出的建议而斗争。协议会的另一位最高委员赵素昂说，中国人民志愿军援助了朝鲜人民的反抗侵略的斗争，已经从朝鲜撤出了许多军队。中国政府已经发表声明，将同共和国政府讨论撤出志愿军的问题。现在美军已经没有任何理由和根据继续留在南朝鲜。
