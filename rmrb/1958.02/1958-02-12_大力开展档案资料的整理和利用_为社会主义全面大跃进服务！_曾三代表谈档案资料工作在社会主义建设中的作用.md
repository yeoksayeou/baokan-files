    Vigorously Carry Out the Sorting and Utilization of Archives to Serve the Overall Socialist Leap Forward!
    Representative Zeng San Discusses the Role of Archives in Socialist Construction
    I agree with and support the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. I am a secretary and an archivist. Now I would like to talk about the role of archival work in socialist construction and how it can coordinate with the high tide of production and the high tide of scientific and cultural construction that has already arrived.
    With the advent of the high tide of socialist economic construction and scientific and cultural construction, the role of archives is becoming increasingly obvious, and the demand for the use of archives is becoming more urgent and widespread. The State Archives Bureau often receives opinions requesting the use of archives or requesting the rapid development of archival work. Many agencies, enterprises, and institutions often send people to various places to blindly collect the archival materials they need. Foreign friends have also repeatedly requested to use China's archives. As for the requirements of scientific researchers for archives, they are even more numerous and urgent. Some criticize severely, some hope earnestly. Three scientists even suggested: scientific bonuses should be issued to personnel who have made outstanding achievements in sorting archives to promote the rapid advancement of archival work to meet objective needs. These requirements place extremely glorious and arduous tasks before us.
    Economic and Cultural Construction Cannot Do Without Archives; Fully Utilizing Them is an Important Method of Building the Country Diligently and Frugally
    Archives are not only one of the indispensable conditions for economic construction and scientific and cultural construction, but also the full utilization of archives is an important method of building the country diligently and frugally, of running all undertakings diligently and frugally, and of ensuring that things are done more, faster, better, and more economically. In April 1956, the State Construction Commission convened its first technical information exchange conference. A total of 45,151 technical materials were exhibited at the conference, and 35,678 exchange contracts were signed, totaling 1.25 million drawings. The achievements of this conference were great. The coal industry system alone saved 25,720 design workdays due to the drawings exchanged at this conference, and the saved workdays could be used to complete the preliminary design of 30 mines with an annual output of 900,000 tons. If all the benefits of this conference are counted, it will be even more impressive. From 1955 to 1957, the various design institutes of the coal industry system copied more than 200,000 drawings. When the Beijing Electric Power Design Branch designed a certain power plant project, it saved nearly two years of labor days for 20 surveying personnel and advanced the construction schedule by utilizing the relevant drawings in the original Rehe archives. Before designing the Sanmenxia Reservoir, the Yellow River Basin Planning Commission urgently needed to grasp the maximum flood volume and minimum dry season flow of the Yellow River in history. They found memorials about the Yellow River's water conditions during the Daoguang period in the Ming and Qing Archives, and their records were more detailed and specific than other materials already mastered, which played an important role in the final decision on the design. These facts show that the use of archives and materials has greatly saved manpower and funds, accelerated the construction process, and advanced the construction and production schedule. Conversely, without archives, many tasks would be difficult to carry out. Representative Liang Sicheng told me that the architecture of Peking Union Medical College Hospital has no archives. When repairing water pipes, they had to dig everywhere, resulting in great losses. The archives of local agencies and small agencies are also very important. For example, the Daxing County Party Committee of Hebei Province put forward more than 40 ways to overcome famine based on the experience recorded in the archives, which played a certain role in leading the people of the county to overcome the disaster in 1956. The Xichuan County Party Committee of Henan Province instructed the archives office to compile a "Chronicle of Historical Disaster Changes in Xichuan County," which was also of great help in studying and grasping the county's rainfall, climate, and disaster patterns. In the field of scientific research, archives are first-hand historical materials. The Sino-French War Historical Materials, the Westernization Movement Historical Materials, the Xinhai Revolution Historical Materials, the Imperialism and the Chinese Customs Issues, Earthquake Data, etc., jointly compiled by the Ming and Qing Archives and the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other relevant agencies, are welcomed by the scientific research community. As for the great use of archives in politics, military affairs, diplomacy, and the daily work of agencies, there have been many facts in recent years, so I won't say more about them. The recent archival exhibition on the evidence of the crimes of the rightist Wang Han held by the Ministry of Supervision is an example.
    The Historical and Practical Significance of Archives is Extremely Great
    We Must Scientifically Preserve it and Fully Utilize it
    It can be seen that archives are a valuable asset of the country, which has both great historical significance and great practical significance. We must systematically and scientifically preserve it by the state in order to fully and fully utilize it.
    In recent years, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have taken many specific measures for archival work. Up to now, China has accumulated some experience and formulated a unified national archival management system and management methods; established a set of archival business management organizations, and also established some archives and archive preparation offices. At the central level, there is the First Historical Archives (preserving Ming and Qing archives) and the Nanjing Historical Materials Compilation Office (preserving the archives of the Kuomintang Central organs), as well as the Central Archives of the Communist Party of China and the Central State Archives of the People's Republic of China, which are under construction. Ten provinces and cities including Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hebei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hubei, Anhui and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have successively established archive preparation offices; archives work organizations have been established in various agencies, enterprises, and institutions; the Chinese People's University has established a historical archives department, which has trained a group of professional cadres. Many agencies, groups, enterprises, and institutions have launched the work of sorting accumulated archives. Many agencies, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Ministry of Supervision, have completed the sorting. Shanghai mobilized thousands of people to sort accumulated archives at the beginning of 1957, and 70% of the provincial-level agencies in Liaoning Province have completed or are close to completion. More than 90% of the archives in the Nanjing Historical Materials Compilation Office have been preliminarily sorted, and one-third of the Ming and Qing archives have also been sorted.
    In short, under the care of the Party and the government, archival work has developed rapidly, which is fundamentally incomparable to before liberation. However, compared with the needs of the development of the situation, our work is still far behind.
    Require All Units and Archives Bureaus to Cooperate Closely
    Go All Out to Do a Good Job in Archival Work
    Due to the imperfect archival work organizations and systems, a large number of archives have not been sorted or have not been completely sorted, and it is not possible to provide more information for production and construction and scientific and cultural construction. Some agencies, enterprises, and institutions do not attach importance to the centralization, sorting, and preservation of archives. Some agencies still destroy archives at will or sell archival materials as waste products, and some agencies do not pay attention to the preservation of archives, placing them in a damp and messy warehouse or in the storage room of the kitchen. The historical archives that have been found are generally still scattered in various agencies and have not been centralized. Even if they have been centralized, there is no strength to sort them. Sorting and centralization require a certain amount of manpower and financial resources. Some agencies and provinces and cities have solved this problem, but most have not yet determined to solve it. Those that have been sorted have not yet been organized and utilized in a planned way.
    In order to change this situation, in order to cooperate with the overall leap forward of socialist construction and accelerate the speed of socialist construction, it is necessary to vigorously carry out the sorting and utilization of archives. We require all agencies, groups, enterprises, and institutions across the country to cooperate closely with us and jointly go all out to do a good job in archival work. At present, the following tasks should be done well:
    Several Tasks That Should Be Done at Present
    First, quickly establish and improve the archival institutions of agencies, enterprises, and institutions, and help archival cadres to specialize; the archives of science and technology should also be properly equipped with some science and technology cadres.
    Second, improve the filing system as soon as possible. After the document is processed, the document processing department should establish an archive and file it regularly; technical documents and materials should be sorted out by the business department and transferred to the archives department for unified management in a timely manner to facilitate access and utilization.
    Third, vigorously carry out sorting work. We require all agencies, enterprises, and institutions that have not sorted out archives to concentrate a group of forces in 1958 to sort out all the accumulated scattered archives and compile a catalog index. Facts have proved that carrying out this kind of sorting work is not very difficult. As long as the leadership supports it, it can be done.
    The State Archives Bureau and the archives management offices of various provinces and cities should also formulate plans to quickly carry out the sorting of historical archives. In this work, we hope that the relevant departments, including the financial and personnel departments, will provide necessary support.
    Fourth, actively collect historical archives and start to centralize the archives of abolished agencies and all historical archives. The archives that current agencies need to preserve permanently should also be concentrated in the national archives for preservation in accordance with the unified time limit stipulated by the state in the future. To this end, all provinces and cities should quickly establish archive preparation offices in accordance with the instructions of the State Council in 1957, and archives can be established when conditions are ripe.
    Fifth, vigorously carry out information work on archives and establish a central and local archives information network in a planned way. This is a very important task. In addition to the State Archives Bureau grasping the national archives situation and compiling an archives directory, becoming the information center of archives, the competent departments should manage the technical materials of the system and become their own material information center. These information centers then constitute a unified national material information network, so that there is a way to find archives and exchange materials.
    We warmly hope that the leading comrades of all agencies across the country, experts in all fields, and all state agency staff will regard archival work as an important undertaking, help archival staff to do their work well, and let it keep up with the needs of the development of the situation. All of us archival workers will definitely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, be ambitious, work hard, strive to study politics, and strive to study business, and become archival workers who are both red and expert, and serve the overall leap forward of socialist construction.

    大力开展档案资料的整理和利用  为社会主义全面大跃进服务！
    曾三代表谈档案资料工作在社会主义建设中的作用
    我同意和拥护李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告，我是一个秘书工作者、档案工作者，现在我想谈一下档案资料工作在社会主义建设中的作用，及其如何配合业已到来的生产高潮和科学文化建设高潮的问题。
    随着社会主义经济建设高潮和科学文化建设高潮的到来，档案资料的作用愈来愈明显，利用档案资料的要求也愈来愈迫切，愈来愈广泛。国家档案局就经常接到要求利用档案资料，或者要求迅速开展档案资料工作的意见。许多机关、企业和事业单位，为了寻找所需要的档案资料，常常派人到各地盲目地从事搜集工作。外国朋友也多次提出利用我国档案资料的要求。至于科学研究工作者对于档案资料的要求，那就更多、更急。有的指责很严，有的希望很切，有三位科学家甚至提出：要对整理档案资料成绩优异的人员发给科学奖金，以促使档案资料工作尽快赶上客观需要。这些要求在我们面前提出了极为光荣和繁重的任务。
    经济文化建设不可缺少档案资料  充分利用是勤俭建国的重要方法
    档案资料不仅是进行经济建设和科学文化建设中不可缺少的条件之一，而且充分地利用档案资料，还是勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业和保证作到又多、又快、又好、又省的重要方法之一。一九五六年四月间国家建委召开了首次技术资料交流会议，会上共展出了四万五千一百五十一项技术资料，互相签订交流合同者为三万五千六百七十八项，计图纸一百二十五万张。这次会议的成绩是很大的，仅煤炭工业系统由于得到这次会议所交流的图纸就节省了二万五千七百二十个设计的工作日，把所节省的工作日拿去作年产九十万吨矿井的初步设计可以作三十个。如果把这次会议的全部收益都统计起来，将更为可观。煤炭工业系统的各个设计院从一九五五年到一九五七年，共套用图纸二十余万张。北京电力设计分院，在设计某电厂工程时，由于利用了原热河档案中有关的图纸，即节省了二十个勘察人员近两年的劳动日，并提前施工了。黄河流域规划委员会，在设计三门峡水库之前，急需掌握黄河在历史上最大的洪水量和最小的枯水量，他们从明清档案馆中找到了道光年间关于黄河水情的奏折，其记载比已经掌握的其他材料都详细具体，对于最后决定设计起到了重要的作用。这些事实说明，由于利用档案和利用资料的结果，就大大地节约了人力和资金，加速了建设进程，并提早了施工和生产。反之，如果没有档案资料，很多工作就难于进行。梁思成代表告诉我，协和医院的建筑没有档案资料，在修理水管的时候只好到处掘开，损失很大。地方机关和小机关的档案资料也是很重要的。例如河北大兴县委根据档案材料所记载的经验提出了四十多条渡荒办法，对领导全县人民战胜一九五六年的灾荒起了一定的作用。河南淅川县委指示档案室编写了一部“淅川县历史灾情变化大事记要”，对于研究掌握该县的雨量、气候、灾害的规律，也有很大帮助。在科学研究方面，档案资料则是第一手史料。明清档案馆和中国科学院等有关机关，共同编辑的中法战争史料、洋务运动史料、辛亥革命史料、帝国主义与中国海关问题、地震资料等，都是科学研究界所欢迎的。至于档案资料在政治、军事、外交以及机关日常工作等方面的用处之大，几年来的事实很多，不多说了。最近中央监察部举行的有关右派分子王翰罪证的档案展览，就是一个例子。
    档案资料的历史和现实意义极大
    必须科学地保管它并充分利用它
    由此可见，档案资料是国家的一项宝贵财富，既有极大的历史意义，又有极大的现实意义。我们必须由国家系统地科学地保管它，才能全面、充分地利用它。
    几年以来，党中央和国务院对于档案资料工作采取了许多具体措施。到目前为止，我国已经积累了一些经验，制定了全国统一的档案管理制度和管理办法；建立了一套档案资料业务管理机构，还建立了一些档案馆和档案馆筹备处。在中央有第一历史档案馆（保存明清档案）和南京史料整理处（保存国民党中央机关的档案），还有正在兴建的中共中央档案馆和中华人民共和国中央国家档案馆，上海、天津、北京、黑龙江、辽宁、河北、陕西、四川、湖北、安徽等十个省市和内蒙古自治区都先后建立了档案馆筹备处；各机关、企业和事业单位建立了档案资料工作机构；中国人民大学成立了历史档案系，培养了一批专业干部。许多机关、团体、企业和事业单位，展开了整理积存档案资料的工作。有不少机关如外交部、外贸部、监察部等八个中央机关已经整理完毕，上海市一九五七年初即动员了数千人整理积存档案，辽宁省省级机关百分之七十已经整完或者接近整完。南京史料整理处的档案百分之九十以上都进行了初步整理，明清档案也整理了三分之一。
    总之，在党和政府的关怀下，档案资料工作已经有了迅速的发展，这种发展同解放前是根本不可比的。但是如果同形势发展的需要来比，我们的工作还是远远落后的。
    要求各单位和档案局密切合作
    鼓起干劲做好档案资料工作
    由于档案资料工作机构和制度尚不健全，大量的档案还没有整理或者没有整完，还不可能为生产建设和科学文化建设提供更多的资料。有些机关、企业和事业单位还不重视档案资料的集中、整理和保管。有的机关仍然随便销毁档案或者把档案材料当废品出卖，有的机关不重视档案资料的保管，把档案放在一个又潮又乱的仓库里，或者放在厨房的储藏室里。已经找到的历史档案一般都还分散在各机关而没有集中，已经集中的也没有力量整理，要整理和集中就需要一定的人力和财力，在这方面一部分机关和省市解决了，但是大部分还没有决心解决。已经整理的也还没有有计划的去组织利用。
    为了改变这种状况，为了配合社会主义建设的全面大跃进，加快社会主义建设的速度，就必须大力开展档案资料的整理和利用。我们要求全国各机关、团体、企业和事业单位同我们密切合作，共同鼓起革命干劲把档案资料工作做好，在目前应该做好如下几项工作：
    目前应该做的几项工作
    第一，迅速建立和健全机关、企业和事业单位的档案资料机构，并且帮助档案资料干部专业化；科学技术的档案资料室，还应该适当的配备一些科学技术干部。
    第二，尽快地把归档制度健全起来。文书办完以后，应该由文书处理部门立成档案定期归档；技术文件材料应由业务部门整理好，及时地移交给档案资料部门统一管理，以便提供调阅和利用。
    第三，大力开展整理工作。我们要求还没有整理档案资料的各机关、企业和事业单位，在一九五八年内集中一批力量把所有积存的零散档案资料全部整理完毕并编出目录索引。事实证明，进行这种整理工作并不是十分困难的，只要领导上支持就可以做到。
    对于历史档案资料的整理工作，国家档案局和各省市档案管理处，也应该订出计划迅速进行。在这项工作中，我们希望各有关部门包括财政和人事部门给予必要的支援。
    第四，积极收集历史档案资料，并着手集中已撤销机关的档案和一切历史档案。现机关需要永久保存的档案，将来也应该按照国家统一规定的年限集中到国家档案馆保存。为此，各省市应该迅速根据一九五七年国务院的指示，建立档案馆筹备处，条件成熟的可以成立档案馆。
    第五，大力开展档案资料的情报工作，有计划的建立中央和地方的档案资料情报网。这是一项十分重要的工作。除了国家档案局应掌握全国档案情况，编出档案全宗目录，成为档案的情报中心以外，各主管部门应该把本系统的技术资料管理起来成为各自的资料情报中心，再由这些情报中心构成全国统一的资料情报网，这样对于利用档案和交换资料就有门路可寻了。
    我们热烈地希望，全国各机关的领导同志、各方面的专家和全体国家机关工作人员，把档案资料工作看成是一门重要的事业，帮助档案资料工作人员把工作做好，让它跟上形势发展的需要。我们全体档案资料工作者一定响应党中央和毛主席的号召，有志气、下苦功、努力学习政治又努力学习业务，做一个又红又专的档案资料工作人员，为社会主义建设的全面大跃进服务。
