Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, February 24th: The annual Monlam Festival officially began here on the 23rd. On this morning, more than 10,000 lamas gathered at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa to chant scriptures and pray.

The Monlam Festival is the most solemn and lively religious festival in the Tibetan region, lasting for twenty-one days. In a few days, the Dalai Lama will move from the Potala Palace to the Jokhang Temple to preside over religious activities such as lecturing on scriptures and debating Buddhist doctrines.

Although the population of Lhasa has suddenly increased greatly, the order in the urban area is still very good. The People's Liberation Army and Han Chinese personnel here greatly respect Tibetan customs and habits. Motor vehicles and bicycles are prohibited from traveling on Barkhor Street around the Jokhang Temple.

During the Monlam Festival, tens of thousands of propaganda materials promoting the achievements of defending world peace, the motherland, and the construction of the Tibetan local area will be distributed to the lamas and pilgrims participating in the festival. The Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the Tibet Military Region will also jointly distribute alms.

    拉萨开始传召节活动
    新华社拉萨24日电　一年一度的传召节23日正式在这里开始。这天早上，一万多名喇嘛齐集在拉萨大昭寺里念经祈祷。
    传召节是西藏地区最隆重、热闹的宗教节日，要连续进行二十一天的活动。几天以后，达赖喇嘛就要从布达拉宫移居大昭寺，主持讲经和辩经等宗教活动。
    尽管拉萨市的人口骤然增加很多，市区秩序仍然很好。在这里的人民解放军和汉族工作人员，十分尊重西藏的风俗习惯。围绕大昭寺的八角街上，禁止行驶机动车和自行车。
    传召期间，几万份宣扬保卫世界和平、祖国和西藏地方建设成就的宣传品，将分发给参加传召的喇嘛和朝佛者。中共西藏工委、西藏自治区筹备委员会、西藏军区还将联合发放布施。
