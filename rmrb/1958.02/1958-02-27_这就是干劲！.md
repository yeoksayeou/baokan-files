    This is Enthusiasm!
    Railway Worker Wang Fan
    Amidst a wave of revolutionary enthusiasm, striving for the upper reaches, someone asked me, where does the enthusiasm of us railway workers manifest itself? Immediately, I thought of these things:
    The train traction weight, before liberation, could only pull a little over a thousand tons. Last year, the traction quota for the Beijing-Guangzhou line (northern section) was 2,500 tons. This January, it was changed again to 2,700 tons. The day before yesterday, we compiled a train of 3,000 tons. Now, some locomotive crew members are even demanding to pull 5,000 tons.
    The main production indicator of our station is the vehicle turnaround time. In January, the turnaround time target set by our station was 3.4 hours, and some groups failed to complete the task. In February, it was compressed to 1.8 hours, and yesterday, some groups were able to complete it in 1.7 hours.
    In the past, a loading and unloading team needed three or forty minutes, even an hour, to unload a coal car, but now it only takes fourteen minutes to empty a coal car.
    These changes have all happened in a matter of days. People's enthusiasm has been raised so high and so full that it has suddenly prompted such great changes in everything around them, as if they have suddenly advanced thousands of miles. With this kind of enthusiasm, we will definitely be able to catch up with or surpass England in steel and other major products within fifteen years.
    But enthusiasm and conservative thinking are deadly enemies. To unleash enthusiasm, we must overcome conservative thinking and break unreasonable old rules! Think about it, if the locomotive workers dare not touch the quota of "pulling 2,500 tons," can they leap to 5,000 tons?

### 这就是干劲！

    这就是干劲！
    铁路工人  王凡
    在一片鼓起革命干劲，力争上游声中，有人问我，咱们铁路工人的干劲表现在哪里？我立时就想起了这几件事：
    列车牵引重量，解放前只能拉一千多吨，去年京广线（北段）牵引定数是二千五百吨，今年元月份又改为二千七百吨，而前天我们编了一列车是三千吨，现在有些机车乘务员竟要求要拉五千吨了。
    我们车站的生产指标主要是车辆中转时间，元月份我们车站定的中转时间指标是三点四小时，还有些小组没能完成任务，2月份压缩成一点八小时，而昨天有的小组竟能完成一点七小时了。
    装卸作业所过去一个小组卸一个煤车需要三四十分钟甚至一个小时，而现在只用十四分钟就可以卸空一个煤车。
    这些变化都是发生在几天的时间里，人们的劲头一下提得那样高那样足，以致促使周围的一切事物突然都起了那样大的变化，好像一下就前进了几千里。就凭这种干劲在十五年内就一定能够在钢铁和其他主要产品方面赶上或超过英国。
    但是干劲和保守思想又是死对头，要想解放出干劲来，就非克服保守思想和打破不合理的陈规不可！想想看，机车工人如果不敢去触动那“牵引二千五百吨”的定额，能够一跃而为五千吨吗？
