Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 31st - Residents of Xijie (West Street) in the Xincheng District of Hohhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, celebrated their elimination of illiteracy within two years by beating drums and gongs on the 29th. The Xincheng District People's Committee has approved the renaming of this street as Cultural Street.

Among the 1,900 people in 520 households of Mongolian, Han, Manchu, and Hui ethnicities residing in Xijie in Xincheng District, over 500 were nearly all illiterate two years ago, excluding government cadres, workers, and students. After the literacy campaign began in the spring of 1956, the 205 young and middle-aged illiterate people (of whom illiterate housewives accounted for 97%) in the whole street began to learn to read and write. By the end of last year, 85% of them had received their literacy graduation certificates. Now these citizens are enthusiastically participating in higher elementary and junior high school classes.

This street is a typical example of relying on the masses to run schools diligently and thriftily in Hohhot. When the literacy campaign first started here, there were no classrooms, so the students divided themselves into study groups based on their living arrangements, studying in courtyards in the summer and on kang (heated brick beds) in the winter. The desks and benches were also made by the students themselves. In terms of teaching, the teachers enrolled women without children in the civil school classes, women with fewer children and diligent housework in group study, and adopted the method of door-to-door tutoring for women with many children. At the same time, the Xijie Residents' Committee also formed many nurseries and groups. This further strengthened the women's confidence in learning culture, enabling all 190 illiterate women aged fourteen to forty in the street to enroll and persist in year-round study.

After achieving literacy graduation results, residents of all ethnic groups quickly established six newspaper reading groups and a reading room on the street, greatly improving their political awareness through reading newspapers and learning. Housewives who had previously been reluctant to participate in social activities are now actively participating in various tasks such as managing households thriftily, paying attention to hygiene, eliminating the four pests, and planting trees and making forests. Many housewives have also changed their bad habits of beating and scolding children in educating their children.

### 呼和浩特文化街  敲锣打鼓庆识字

　　呼和浩特文化街  敲锣打鼓庆识字
    新华社呼和浩特31日电　内蒙古自治区呼和浩特市新城区西街的居民们，29日敲锣打鼓庆祝他们在两年内扫除了文盲。新城区人民委员会已批准把这条街改名为文化街。
    居住在新城区西街的蒙古、汉、满、回民族的五百二十户一千九百人中，除了机关干部、职工和学生以外，有五百多人在两年前几乎都是文盲。从1956年春季开始扫盲后，全街的二百零五名青壮年文盲（其中家庭妇女文盲就占97％）才开始学习文化，到去年底有85％的人领到了扫盲毕业证书。现在这些市民们又踊跃地参加高小班和初中班学习。
    这条街在呼和浩特市，是依靠群众勤俭办学的一个典型。这里扫盲刚开始，没有教室，学员们便按照居住的情况划分学习小组，夏天在院子里学习，冬天在炕头上学习，桌凳也是学员们自制的。教员在教学上把没有孩子的妇女编入民校班学习，把孩子少家务勤的妇女编入小组学习，对孩子多的妇女采用送上门包教的办法。同时，西街居民委员会还组成了很多托儿所、组。这样就进一步坚定了妇女们学习文化的信心，使全街十四岁到四十岁的一百九十名妇女文盲全部入了学，并坚持常年学习。
    各民族居民们在达到扫盲毕业成绩后，很快就在街道上成立了六个读报组和一个阅览室，通过读报学习大大提高了政治觉悟。过去一向不爱参加社会活动的家庭妇女，现在也积极参加了勤俭持家和讲卫生、除四害、植树造林等各项工作。很多家庭妇女在教育子女上，也改变了过去打骂孩子的坏习惯。
