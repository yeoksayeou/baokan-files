    Intensify the Rectification of Backward Cooperatives
    Lin Mu
    In the movement to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production, the problem of rectifying backward cooperatives (Category Three cooperatives) should receive serious attention.
    Whether an agricultural cooperative is doing good work or bad work has a profound impact on its members, the cooperative, and the country. A good cooperative can increase production, enable every farm household and every individual to attain a prosperous and happy life, greatly encourage the broad masses of farmers to resolutely take the socialist road, and successfully fulfill the tasks farmers should bear for the country... If an agricultural cooperative is not run well, all of the above may be in vain. If we understand the profound impact of the quality of work in agricultural cooperatives, and understand how heavy a burden we bear for hundreds of millions of farmers, then we cannot fail to see how urgent it is to concentrate efforts on rectifying backward cooperatives.
    The general characteristics of backward cooperatives are: business management is not on track, systems are chaotic; everyone grabs for work points while working, regardless of quality; labor compensation is unreasonable, some benefit while others suffer; the masses are not enthusiastic about the collective economy, cadres are not very responsible, the role of Party and Youth League organizations is small, or bad elements and wealthy middle peasants, landlords, and rich peasants have seized actual leadership of the cooperative… All of this will directly or indirectly affect production. Currently, many backward cooperatives cannot achieve the same harvest under the same objective conditions because various agricultural activities are poorly organized, cultivation is extensive, fertilizer is insufficient, and new technologies and experiences cannot be promoted, some even differ greatly. They cannot fulfill obligations to the country such as selling surplus grain, and the lives of cooperative members are not improved. Some do not even have enough food grain and need the state to supply it. If this situation is not changed quickly, it will be difficult for the local cooperative members to specifically see the superiority of cooperation, and their will to move forward will be greatly affected.
    Many regional Party committees have taken practical measures in this rectification to concentrate great efforts to rectify backward cooperatives, resulting in a rapid change in the situation and great progress, which is very good. However, there are also many areas that have not properly arranged various winter activities and lack comprehensive planning. As a result, they lost sight of the other, allowing production and construction activities such as water conservancy to squeeze out the work of rectifying cooperatives. Many problems within the cooperatives that had to be resolved early were not resolved in time, which will inevitably affect this year's production. Now that spring plowing is not far away, these areas must quickly make an emergency arrangement and allocate the necessary forces to remedy this deficiency.

    加紧整顿落后社
    林木
    在争取农业生产大跃进的运动中，整顿落后社
  （三类社）的问题应当引起严重的注意。
    一个农业合作社工作做得好，或坏，对社员、社和国家都会发生深刻的影响。一个好的合作社，它可以增加生产，可以使每一个农户和每一个人都得到富裕幸福的生活，可以大大鼓舞广大农民坚决走社会主义的道路，可以很好地完成农民对国家应负的任务……。农业合作社如果办得不好，以上一切都可能落空。我们如果明白农业合作社工作好坏的这种深刻的影响，明白自己对数亿农民担负了多么重的担子，那我们就不能不看到集中力量整顿落后社是多么迫切的事情。
    落后社的一般特点，是经营管理不上轨道，制度混乱；做活时大家抢工分，不顾质量；劳动报酬不合理，便宜的便宜，吃亏的吃亏；群众对集体经济不热心，干部不大负责任，党、团组织作用不大，或者是坏分子和富裕中农、地主、富农掌握了社的实际领导权……。所有这些，都会直接间接影响到生产。现在有许多落后社因为各种农事活动组织得不好，耕作粗放，肥料不足，新技术新经验不能推广，所以在同样的客观条件之下不能得到同样的收获，有的甚至差得很远，对国家不能担负售余粮之类的义务，社员生活也得不到改善，有的连口粮也不充裕，还要国家供应。这种情形如不迅速改变，就很难使当地社员群众具体看到合作化的优越性，他们的前进的意志会受到很大的影响。
    许多地区的党委在这次整改中采取了切实的措施，集中了很大的力量来整顿落后社，结果迅速改变了局面，取得了很大的进展，这是很好的。但是也还有许多地区没有很好地安排冬季各种活动，缺少通盘的筹划，结果顾此失彼，让修水利等生产建设活动把整社工作挤掉了，社内许多必须及早解决的问题没有及早解决，势必影响今年的生产。现在离春耕已经不远，这些地区必须赶快作一个紧急的安排，调配必要的力量来补救这一缺陷。
