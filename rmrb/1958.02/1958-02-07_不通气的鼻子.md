　　Stuffy Nose
　　Qin Tingquan, Attending Physician, Beijing Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital

    In our daily clinical work, the most common symptom of nasal disease is a blocked nose, making it difficult to breathe. Some people have both nostrils completely blocked; others have alternating blockage of the left and right nostrils, especially when sleeping. Lying on the left side blocks the left nostril, and lying on the right side blocks the right nostril. Patients have to breathe through their mouths, leading to dry mouth and tongue, dizziness, headaches, fatigue, and even reduced concentration, thinking ability, and memory.

    We have used various scientific methods to examine people with this symptom and found that they suffer from either chronic rhinitis or chronic sinusitis.

    Chronic rhinitis is caused by repeated colds that have not been treated correctly or in a timely manner. It may also be caused by nasal deformities (such as deviated septum) or allergic reactions. It could also be caused by systemic diseases (such as pulmonary tuberculosis, diabetes, anemia, etc.). The nasal mucosa of these patients becomes thickened due to inflammation, or the surface is uneven and mulberry-shaped, thus blocking the respiratory passage. Moreover, there are a large number of bacteria in the mucosa and its deeper layers, so a lot of nasal discharge is constantly produced, which further increases the degree of blockage. This also leads to a reduction in the sense of smell and taste (loss of appetite); the nasal discharge also flows back into the mouth, so they often spit.

    What is sinusitis? There are many bone cavities around the nasal cavity that are directly connected to the nasal cavity. These cavities also have mucous membranes, which are also connected to the nasal mucosa. If the nasal mucosa is inflamed for a long time, the inflammation can spread along the mucosa to these bone cavities, which is called sinusitis, a disease secondary to rhinitis. In addition to the symptoms of chronic rhinitis, these patients have one characteristic: more nasal discharge. This nasal discharge is actually pus, which is yellow or green, particularly viscous, and has an odor. The reason why there is so much nasal discharge is that the bone cavities of the sinuses are large and produce a lot of pus, which is discharged after accumulation.

    These two diseases, especially the latter, are very stubborn and difficult to cure quickly, so it is best to prevent them from occurring in the first place. Prevention should start with preventing colds. In addition, the hygiene of the living environment, personal hygiene, indoor air circulation, and ensuring the body does not lack calcium and vitamins A, B, C, and D are all indispensable conditions for preventing rhinitis. If you have already contracted these two diseases, or if you find that your nose is blocked, you should seek medical treatment and not delay.

### 不通气的鼻子

　　不通气的鼻子
　　北京市耳鼻喉医院主治医师　秦廷权
    在我们平日的临床工作中，最常见的鼻病症状是鼻子堵塞，不通气。有些人是两个鼻孔全堵塞住了；有些人是左右鼻孔轮流堵塞，特别在睡觉的时候，向左边躺，左鼻孔不通气，向右边躺，右鼻孔不通气。患者不得不用嘴来呼吸，以致口干舌燥、头昏脑胀、头痛、体疲无力，甚至精神集中力、思考力及记忆力也减退了。
    我们曾用各种科学方法去检查有这种症状的人，结果证实他们生的都是慢性鼻炎或慢性鼻窦炎两种病。
    慢性鼻炎是由于患者屡次感冒而又没有经过正确或及时的治疗所致。也可能是由于鼻腔内畸形（如鼻中隔偏曲症）引起的变态反应症；更可能是由于全身性的疾病（如肺结核、糖尿病、贫血等）染患成的。这些病人的鼻粘膜因为炎症侵犯而肥厚起来，或者表面凹凸不平呈桑椹的形态，以致阻塞呼吸通路。而且，在粘膜及粘膜的深层有大量细菌，所以经常不断的产生很多鼻涕，这就更增加堵塞程度。由此还引起嗅觉，味觉减退（吃饭不香）；鼻涕也倒流到口中，所以看起来他们又最爱吐痰。
    什么是鼻窦炎呢？原来鼻腔的四周有很多骨洞，同鼻腔直接相通。这些洞里也有粘膜，也都与鼻粘膜相连接。假如鼻粘膜长期发炎不愈，炎症就能沿着粘膜传染到这些骨洞里边去，这就叫作鼻窦炎，是续发于鼻炎之后的病。这种病人除具有慢性鼻炎的症状外，还有一个特点是鼻涕更多。这鼻涕实际就是脓液，呈黄或绿色，特别粘稠而有臭味。鼻涕之所以多，是因为鼻窦骨洞很大，产脓很多，经存积起来之后才排出的缘故。
    这两种病，特别是后者，很顽固，很难一下治愈，所以最好是不生，这就要靠平时预防了。预防首先要从预防感冒入手。此外，居住环境的卫生、个人卫生、室内空气流通、勿使身体缺少钙质及维生素甲、乙、丙、丁等，都是预防鼻炎不可缺少的条件。如果已经得了这两种病，或是发现有鼻堵现象，就应去诊治，不要自误。
