Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: Anhui Province's spring plowing preparation work this year is characterized by high enthusiasm, early action, large quantity, and good quality.

The preparation work started ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years. At present, almost all of the province's more than 27 million mu of winter fallow land has been plowed, with winter plowing area increasing more than four times compared to 1956. The vast majority of winter fallow land has been plowed twice, and some even three times.

An unprecedented scale of water management and fertilizer accumulation movement has prepared sufficient water sources and fertilizers for spring plowing. This year, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of spring-sown crops in the province is expected to increase about four times compared to last year.

This year's draft animal maintenance work has been done better than any previous year. The forage that farmers in various places have stored is not only sufficient to meet the needs of draft animals, but some places cannot even use it all. Various places have also vigorously carried out winter draft animal epidemic prevention work. In the Bengbu area alone, 400,000 draft animals have been injected with vaccines. Coupled with the widespread implementation of the "special personnel management, household maintenance" draft animal maintenance system in various places, no cases of draft animals freezing or starving to death have been found so far. More than 800 agricultural cooperatives in the three areas of Lu'an, Bengbu, and Fuyang have also purchased more than 34,000 head of draft animals.

In order to ensure the needs of changing to rice cultivation in the Huaibei area, a large number of handicraft workers from the Yangtze River area have been transferred to Huaibei to rush to make waterwheels and other farm tools on the spot. Most of the seeds needed for spring-sown crops in the province have been inspected and are now being transported.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: While rushing to complete water conservancy projects, rural Hubei is preparing for spring plowing in advance. Xinzhou County has organized a spring plowing preparation work inspection committee. Many agricultural cooperatives in Xishui County have organized teams responsible for managing seeds, rice seedling fields, and cattle. Many agricultural cooperatives in Echeng, Guangji, Hanyang, and Yicheng counties are preparing rice seedling fields or selecting cotton seeds in advance.

This year, Hubei Province will vigorously promote double-cropping rice and improved varieties, so the task of seed transfer is very heavy. Early and late rice seeds alone require more than 160 million jin. In order to solve the 80 million jin of early rice seeds needed in various places, the agricultural department has sent a large number of cadres to Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other seven provinces to purchase them.

Various places are holding agricultural technology training courses on a large scale or inviting technical guidance groups to teach technology. Puqi and Jiayu counties have invited a group of rice experts from Xiaogan and Huangpi counties, which are high-yield rice areas, to serve as instructors in various agricultural cooperatives.

Handicraft cooperatives in various places have organized a group of blacksmiths and carpenters to go to the countryside to repair farm tools. Two agricultural cooperatives in Xima Township, Xishui County, have repaired and manufactured more than 360 pieces of large and small farm tools. Many iron and wood handicraft cooperatives are stepping up the expansion of equipment and training of technical forces to meet the heavy tasks of farm tool manufacturing and repair this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu: As spring plowing is about to begin, the grain and agricultural departments of Sichuan Province are accelerating the transfer and transportation of improved varieties. The province has already transported back a batch of excellent early and late rice seeds such as "Nante No. 16," "Ishikari Shiramomi," "Yuanzi No. 2," and "Yellow Shell Early" from Guangdong, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and other provinces. The "Dai Zi Cotton" seeds transferred from Hubei Province have also begun to be shipped. According to the plan, Sichuan will import more than 25 million jin of various improved rice seeds and more than 14 million jin of Dai Zi Cotton seeds from Guangdong, Jiangsu, and other seven provinces this year, as well as a batch of improved flax and sugar beet seeds.

This year, the improved rice varieties transferred and allocated in Sichuan generally have the characteristics of early maturity and strong adaptability, which are convenient for connecting front and back crops and can be planted in various fertile and barren cultivated lands. The "Ishikari Shiramomi" early rice seed imported from Heilongjiang this time is not only resistant to low temperatures and has a high yield, but also matures half a month earlier than the "Nante No."

At the same time, Sichuan Province has also transferred a large number of "Nante No." early rice and "Wuxia Dongyu" and other improved varieties to Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, Yunnan, Guangdong, and other provinces.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming: Since the end of last autumn harvest, farmers in various parts of Yunnan Province have exchanged more than 6 million jin of improved seeds. The Provincial Department of Agriculture has also transferred 150,000 jin of excellent seeds from Sichuan, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Tianjin, and other provinces and cities to supply Yuxi, Chuxiong, and other regions in the province for trial planting.

Yunnan Province has successively established 104 seed stations. After the Nanshan Valley and other grain seeds and Golden Queen corn, Dabaibahua potatoes, etc., cultivated by the seed stations were promoted in Dali, Qujing, and other places, the yields were much higher than those of local general varieties.

### 保养耕畜　修补农具　调剂良种  安徽湖北等省提前准备春耕

    保养耕畜　修补农具　调剂良种
    安徽湖北等省提前准备春耕
    据新华社合肥讯　安徽省今年春耕准备工作的特点是干劲足、动手早、数量多、质量好。
    备耕工作比往年提早了十天到半月。目前全省二千七百多万亩冬闲田，几乎全部都耕犁了，冬耕面积比1956年增加了四倍多。绝大部分冬闲田耕了两遍，有的还耕了三遍。
    空前规模的治水和积肥运动，为春耕准备了充足的水源和肥料。今年全省春播作物每亩施肥量，约可比去年增加四倍。
    今年耕畜保养工作，比过去任何一年都做得好。各地农民已经贮备的草料，不仅可以满足耕畜的需要，有些地方还用不了。各地还大力进行了冬季耕畜防疫工作，仅蚌埠专区就有四十万头耕畜注射了防疫针。加上各地普遍推行了“专人管理，保养到户”的耕畜保养制度，到现在还没有发现耕畜冻死、饿死的现象。六安、蚌埠、阜阳三个专区的八百多个农业社，还购进了三万四千多头耕畜。
    为了保证淮北地区改种水稻的需要，沿江地区的大批手工业工人已经调到淮北就地赶制水车等农具。全省春播作物需要调运的种子，大部分已检验好了，现正在调运中。
    据新华社武汉讯　在突击完成水利工程的同时，湖北农村提前准备春耕。新洲县已组织了一个备耕工作检查委员会。浠水县许多农业社组织了负责专管种籽、秧田、耕牛等备耕工作的班子。鄂城、广济、汉阳、宜城等县许多农业社提前整理秧田或进行棉花选种。
    今年湖北省将大力推广双季稻和推广良种，因此种子调剂的任务很大，仅早、晚稻种子就需要一亿六千多万斤。农业部门为解决各地所需要的八千多万斤早稻种籽，已派出大批干部分赴四川、湖南、江西等七省采购。
    各地正在大规模举办农业技术训练班或邀请技术辅导团传授技术。蒲圻、嘉鱼两县已分别从水稻高产区的孝感、黄陂两县请来了一批水稻能手到各农业社当辅导员。
    各地手工业社已经组织了一批铁炉和木匠下乡修补农具。浠水县洗马乡的两个农业社已经修理和制造了大小农具三百六十多件。许多铁业和木业手工业社正加紧扩大设备和培养技术力量，以适应今年繁重的农具制造和修补的任务。
    据新华社成都讯　春耕快要开始，四川省粮食和农业部门正在加速进行良种的调剂和调运工作。全省已从广东、江苏、黑龙江、辽宁等省运回一批“南特十六号”、“石狩白芒”、“元子二号”、“黄壳早”等优良早、晚稻种。从湖北省调运的“岱字棉”种也已开始启运。按照计划，四川今年将从广东、江苏等七省运进各种水稻良种二千五百多万斤，岱字棉种一千四百多万斤，还有一批亚麻和甜菜的良种。
    今年，四川调运和调剂的水稻良种，一般都具有成熟早、适应性强的特点，便于衔接前后作物，能种在各种肥瘠耕地中。这次从黑龙江运来的“石狩白芒”早稻良种，不仅耐低温、产量高，而且比“南特号”成熟期早半个月。
    与此同时，今年四川省也调出了大量“南特号”早稻和“巫峡洞芋”等良种，供给湖北、浙江、安徽、云南、广东等省。
    据新华社昆明讯　云南省各地农民从去年秋收结束以来，已互相掉换良种六百多万斤。省农业厅还从四川、浙江、广东、天津等省、市调来十五万斤优良籽种，供给省内玉溪、楚雄等专区试种。
    云南省已经先后建立了一百零四个籽种站。由籽种站培育过的南山谷等谷种和金皇后玉米、大白花洋芋等，在大理、曲靖等地推广以后，产量都比当地一般品种高出很多。
