The second high tide of water conservancy construction since agricultural production cooperatives has been surging forward across the country. Hundreds of millions of peasants have thrown themselves into this great struggle to transform nature. Over the past few months, good news has been pouring in, which is exciting and inspiring. By February 20, the nation's newly expanded irrigation area this year had reached over 165.5 million mu, far exceeding the original plan of 92 million mu. What would have taken thousands of years to accomplish in the past is now being done by the nation's peasants in just a few months under the leadership of the Communist Party. Because the mass water conservancy construction movement is developing rapidly by leaps and bounds, many provinces have repeatedly raised their water conservancy construction plan targets, soaring upwards. A large number of counties and cities (suburban areas) across the country will achieve water conservancy this spring. According to Henan Province statistics, recently sixteen counties including Xinyang, Jiaxian, and Nanle, and two cities, Anyang and Xinxiang, have basically achieved water conservancy. Xuchang Prefecture will basically achieve water conservancy before the flood season this year. Now, the spring plowing season is not far away. Everyone should redouble their efforts to continue to push the high tide of water conservancy construction forward, in order to finally win a complete victory.

The victory is unprecedentedly huge, but huge victories also easily lead to pride, complacency and relaxation. In addition, the spring plowing season is approaching, and preparations for plowing are busier than before. If leadership is not strengthened, some areas may also relax their water conservancy work. According to the Jiangxi Daily, signs of slackening in water conservancy construction have begun to appear in individual areas. The reason is that some cadres and farmers believe that a lot of water conservancy projects have already been built and it is time to call it a day. Although this phenomenon is currently only individual, it is worth paying attention to. It should be seen that although a lot of water conservancy projects have been built in winter, compared with the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production, water conservancy projects are not too many, but still far from enough. In some places, the completed projects are still far from the revised plan targets. Therefore, at this time of year, we must advance on the victory and continue to struggle. Although the spring plowing seasons in the South and North are different, and the time for water conservancy construction in spring cannot be required to be the same everywhere, all regions should do their best to build more water conservancy projects in spring. Building one more project will give this year's agricultural production one more point of material strength to resist floods and droughts, and one more point of guarantee for increased production. The peasants of Huaiyang County, Henan Province, put forward the slogan "Work hard in winter, go all out in spring," which means that they should not relax water conservancy construction during the busy spring season. This is a very good initiative. All regions should, on the basis of overall planning of various agricultural activities, go all out in water conservancy in spring.

What needs to be done urgently at present is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the progress of water conservancy construction, line up all water conservancy projects, see which projects can be completed on time or ahead of schedule, and which projects are progressing slowly and need to be promoted by taking measures. In this way, the leadership can have a clear understanding of the situation and can set a deadline for the completion of each project according to the actual situation and urge each project to proceed faster. After classifying the projects, Yun County, Hubei Province, dispatched 150 cadres to strengthen the large and medium-sized water conservancy projects with slower progress, and at the same time made unified allocation of the county's water conservancy technical cadres. This is a very good method and can be adopted everywhere.

In spring, agricultural activities increase, and the allocation of labor becomes particularly tight. This requires the leadership to make unified arrangements for the specific tasks of water conservancy construction, soil and water conservation, manure accumulation, afforestation, sideline occupations, and spring plowing in accordance with the principle of overall consideration, so that various production and construction activities can be carried out in an orderly manner. However, even if the above arrangements are made, some areas with large water conservancy construction tasks may still face difficulties in the shortage of labor. What should we do about this? According to the experience of many places, the best way is to improve labor organization, improve labor tools, increase labor efficiency, and accelerate project progress. The average water conservancy work efficiency in Jiangxi Province is 1.6 cubic meters, but some are as high as 3 cubic meters, and some are less than 1 cubic meter, which shows that the potential for improving labor efficiency is great. In terms of improving tools, the masses in various places have made many creations. For example, in terms of transportation, various places have created aerial transportation tools, landslide transportation tools, wooden rail handcarts, and so on. The use of these tools is many times more efficient than human carrying. Simple cranes and ramming machines using the lever principle also have high efficiency. There are many inventions and creations by the masses. The problem is whether the leaders pay attention to it and whether they can quickly promote it according to local conditions. The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee recently made a decision to launch a technical innovation movement for water conservancy construction throughout the province, requiring all prefectures and counties to vigorously adopt new construction tools. Such a decision is very timely.

This year, all localities generally attach importance to the quality of projects in water conservancy construction, so the quality of projects is generally better. However, this issue still needs close attention. Spring plowing is coming soon, and time is even more precious. If a quality accident occurs at this time, it will be difficult to find time for rework. Even if it is possible to rework, it will inevitably affect the progress of the entire water conservancy construction. Therefore, the later it gets, the more it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of hasty construction and neglect of quality. In order to ensure the quality of the project, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance on the one hand, and to strengthen quality inspection on the other hand. Not only should attention be paid to the acceptance after the completion of the project, but also to the regular inspection during the project. If you don’t pay attention to the inspection and correct the shortcomings in quality in time, it will be more troublesome to recover the losses when the completion acceptance is completed.

Putting the completed water conservancy projects into agricultural production immediately, so that they can be built in the same year and benefit in the same year, is the urgent demand of the broad masses of peasants. Therefore, in addition to ensuring the quality of the project, all localities need to do the relevant work well, including the establishment of project management agencies, the purchase and installation of mechanical or manual irrigation equipment, the training of irrigation technicians, land leveling, canal repair, and so on. Hebei Province proposed the issue of using them as they are repaired very early in the water conservancy construction movement, requiring "the reservoir to be completed, the canal to be connected, and the well to be leveled." Daliu Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, opened a 1,500-meter-long canal overnight last winter, and used this canal to irrigate wheat fields at dawn. Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, put forward the slogan "Complete one place, store water in one place", and try to use the completed projects to accumulate rainwater, so as to enhance the ability to resist drought during the spring plowing season. Now Xiangyang Prefecture has launched a mass movement to store and conserve water. This approach is most popular with the masses, and it can be widely promoted and promoted everywhere.

### 乘胜前进，大干一春

    乘胜前进，大干一春
    农业生产合作化以后第二次水利建设的高潮，正在全国各地汹涌澎湃地向前发展。亿万农民投入了这场改造自然的伟大斗争。几个月来，捷报频传，令人兴奋鼓舞。到2月20日，全国今年新扩大的灌溉面积已达一亿六千五百多万亩，远远超过了原定的九千二百万亩的计划。过去需要千百年才能做到的事，现在全国农民在共产党的领导下，用几个月的时间就做到了。由于群众性的水利建设运动一日千里，发展极快，许多省的水利建设计划指标一再提高，扶摇直上。全国有一大批县市（郊区）将在今年春季实现水利化。仅据河南省统计，最近就有信阳、郏县、南乐等十六个县和安阳、新乡两市基本上实现了水利化。许昌专区将在今年汛期以前基本上实现水利化。现在，距离春耕季节已经不远，大家应当再加一把劲，把水利建设的高潮继续推向前进，以便最后赢得完全的胜利。
    胜利是空前巨大的，但是巨大的胜利也往往容易使人产生骄傲自满和松劲情绪。再加上春耕季节临近，备耕活动较前更加繁忙，如果不注意加强领导，有些地区也很可能放松了水利工作。据江西日报报道，水利建设上的松懈现象在个别地区已经开始露头。原因是有些干部和农民认为水利工程已经修得不少了，可以收兵了。这种现象目前虽然只是个别的，却很值得注意。应当看到，冬季水利工程虽然修得不少，但是同农业生产大跃进的需要相比，水利工程不是多，而是还很不足。有些地方已修成的工程离增订的计划指标还差很远。因此，在目前这个季节，还要乘胜前进，继续奋斗。虽然南方和北方春耕季节迟早不一，各地在春季兴修水利的时间也不能要求一样，但是不论那个地区，在春季里都应当尽最大可能多修一些水利工程。多修一个工程，今年农业生产就多一分抗御水旱灾害的物质力量，就多一分增产的保证。河南省淮阳县农民提出“苦干一冬，大干一春”的口号，就是说，在春忙季节也不放松兴修水利。这是一个很好的倡议。各地都应当在统筹安排各种农事活动的基础上，在水利方面大干一春。
    目前迫切需要做的，是对于水利建设进展情况进行一次全面的检查，把各项水利工程都排一排队，看看哪些工程可以按期或提前完成，哪些工程进行迟缓，需要采取措施加以推动。这样，领导上才能心中有数，才能根据实际情况给各项工程定出完工的期限，督促各项工程加速进行。湖北省郧县在工程分类排队以后，抽派了一百五十名干部去加强进度较慢的大、中型水利工程，同时对全县的水利技术干部也做了统一调配。这是很好的办法，各地都可以采用。
    春季里农事活动增多，劳动力的调配显得格外紧张。这就要求领导方面根据统筹兼顾的原则，把兴修水利、水土保持、积肥、造林、副业和春耕的各项具体工作统一安排，使得各项生产建设能够有条不紊地进行。但是，即便做了上面的安排，在某些水利建设任务较大的地区，仍然可能发生劳动力不足的困难。这怎么办呢？根据许多地方的经验，最好的办法就是改善劳动组织，改进劳动工具，提高劳动效率，加速工程进度。江西省全省平均水利工效是一点六公方，但有的高达三公方，有的还不到一公方，这说明提高劳动效率的潜力是很大的。在改进工具方面，各地群众已经有了很多创造。比如运输方面，各地就创造了空中运输工具、滑坡运输工具、木轨手推车等等。采用这些工具，比人挑人担效率要高好多倍。简易的起重机、利用杠杆原理的打夯器等等，也都有很高的效率。群众的发明创造多得很，问题在于领导者是不是重视，能不能因地制宜地迅速推广。浙江省委不久以前做了决定，要在全省开展一个水利建设技术革新运动，要求各专区和各县大力采用新式施工工具。这样的决定就很及时。
    今年各地在兴修水利方面，对于工程质量一般都是重视的，因此工程质量一般较好。但是这个问题仍有密切加以注意的必要。目前春耕就快到了，时间更加宝贵了，如果在这个时候发生了质量事故，连返工的时间也难得了。即使来得及返工，也必然要影响整个水利建设的进度。因此，越是到了后期，越要防止草率施工、忽视质量的现象发生。为了保证工程质量，一方面需要加强技术指导，一方面也需要加强质量检查。不但要注意工程完工以后的验收，还要注意工程进行期间经常性的检查。假如平常不注意检查，及时纠正质量方面的缺点，等到完工验收时要挽回损失，就麻烦多了。
    把已经建成的水利工程立即用到农业生产上去，做到当年建设，当年受益，这是广大农民的迫切要求。因此，各地除了保证工程的质量以外，还需要把有关的工作做好，这里包括建立工程管理机构，购买和安装机械的或手工的灌溉设备，训练灌溉技术人员，平整土地，修整渠道等等。河北省在兴修水利运动中很早就提出了随修随用的问题，要求做到“库成渠通，井成地平”。河北省的满城县大六村去年冬季连夜开了一条一千五百公尺长的渠道，天明就利用这条渠道灌麦田。湖北省襄阳专区提出了“完工一处，蓄水一处”的口号，尽量利用已经修成的工程把雨水积蓄起来，以便在春耕时期增强抗旱能力。现在襄阳专区已经掀起了群众性的蓄水保水运动。这样的做法最受群众欢迎，各地也可以普遍地加以提倡和推广。
