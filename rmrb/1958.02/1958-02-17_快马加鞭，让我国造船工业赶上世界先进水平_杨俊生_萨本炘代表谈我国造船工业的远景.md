I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and I suggest that the congress approve them.

Our great motherland has entered the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, which will be a year of new leaps forward in the national economy. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have called on us to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of steel and other major industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer. This resounding call has become a huge driving force and encouragement for the great leap forward in China's industry. All industries are proposing concrete action plans based on their own conditions, taking practical actions to respond to the Party's great call. We are technicians in the shipbuilding industry, and we would like to express some opinions on how the shipbuilding industry can catch up with the United Kingdom in fifteen years.

A Comparison of the Shipbuilding Industry Situation Between China and the United Kingdom

First, let us analyze the basic situation of the shipbuilding industry in China and the United Kingdom from the following aspects.

First, regarding the amount of merchant ships owned. In 1906, the United Kingdom's merchant ship ownership was 16,381,000 gross tons, accounting for 43% of the world's total merchant ship tonnage; in 1956, the ownership was 19,546,000 gross tons, accounting for 18% of the world's total merchant ship tonnage. These figures show that although the overall trend of the United Kingdom's merchant ship ownership is increasing, the rate of increase is extremely slow. From 1906 to 1956, it increased by a total of 3,165,000 gross tons in fifty years, with an average annual increase of only 60,000 gross tons. Before liberation, China's merchant ship ownership was approximately 1.2 million gross tons. At the time of liberation, most of the merchant ships were destroyed and looted by the Kuomintang reactionaries. After eight years of repairs and restoration, China's current merchant ship ownership has not yet recovered to the pre-liberation level.

Second, regarding annual output. The United Kingdom currently has more than 130 shipyards with more than 200,000 shipbuilding employees. According to existing data, in 1948, the United Kingdom launched 1,176,000 gross tons of ships, accounting for 50% of the world's total launched ship tonnage; in 1956, the launched ships were 1,383,000 gross tons, accounting for 20% of the world's total launched ship tonnage. From the above figures, it can be seen that the United Kingdom's annual ship output is approximately between 1.3 million and 1.4 million gross tons. Approximately 60% to 70% of the ships produced in the United Kingdom are manufactured for foreign countries. In China, the annual output will definitely reach a quite astonishing number after the decision on shipbuilding plans in the second and third five-year plans is made, based on the current production capacity of civilian ships in existing shipyards.

Third, regarding cost and production cycle. The price of shipbuilding in the United Kingdom is increasing year by year. Taking the price of a 9,500-ton deadweight cargo ship as an example: in 1945, the construction cost was £265,000 per ship, and the selling price was £240,000 in order to compete with foreign countries; in 1957, the construction cost per ship was £775,000, and the selling price was £900,000. China has not yet built large ships. According to rough estimates, the ex-factory price of the first new 10,000-ton cargo ship is approximately 12 million yuan, which is much higher than the selling price of similar specifications of ships in the United Kingdom. However, it must be stated that this is the price of a trial product. In formal production, it is mass-produced standardized products, which can be supplied with inexpensive domestic steel, machines, instruments, etc., and the design, construction, and management levels are improved, and the cost will be reduced a lot. If it can be reduced by 30% to 40%, it will be slightly equal to the current cost in the United Kingdom. There is no problem in reaching this level within fifteen years. In terms of the shipbuilding cycle, the production cycle for building a 10,000-ton cargo ship in the United Kingdom is approximately twelve to fifteen months. The planned cycle for China's self-made 10,000-ton ocean-going cargo ship is twenty-one to twenty-three months, which can be reduced to fifteen to eighteen months after mass production. Recently, we discussed the production cycle of 10,000-ton ships in Shanghai, and we proposed a fighting goal of ten months. We believe that as long as we seize the production preparation work and receive close cooperation from relevant collaborative industrial departments, it is also no problem to reach this standard within fifteen years.

Fourth, regarding the adoption of new technologies and new equipment. The construction years of British shipyards are generally in the late 19th century to the early 20th century, and the equipment is very old, and not much new equipment has been added. They are relatively conservative in adopting new technologies. Up to now, a considerable proportion still uses a mixed structure of riveting and welding. China has surpassed the United Kingdom in some aspects of adopting new process technologies, new equipment, installation technology, and hull manufacturing.

Fifth, regarding product quality. Since China has not yet built large ships, it is difficult to compare the quality of large ships with that of the United Kingdom. However, the shipbuilding industry is a comprehensive industry, and the quality of its products relies on collaborative factories in many aspects. The main equipment in ships, such as high-quality steel such as medium manganese steel, low-speed large diesel engines, steam turbines, gas turbines, and further use of atomic energy, rely on the cooperation of steel industry, machinery industry and other factories; other such as auxiliary machines, instruments, motors, fire-resistant materials, etc. must also be supplied by other factories. As for another aspect that determines the quality of ships, namely construction and process quality, the Polish delegation recently visited the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai and believed that Chinese shipyards have surpassed the United Kingdom in terms of construction and process quality. Therefore, as long as the product quality of collaborative factories can catch up with or exceed the United Kingdom within fifteen years, the product quality of the shipbuilding industry can be guaranteed to catch up with or exceed the United Kingdom within fifteen years.

Sixth, regarding product design and scientific research. The product design of the British shipbuilding industry is carried out in the shipyard, without an independent design institution. There are approximately 3,000 to 5,000 designers in the country. British ship design work is not as detailed as what we are currently doing, but because of more experience, more data, and skilled workers, the number of construction drawings is very small, so the entire design cycle is shorter than ours. A cargo ship with a deadweight of 10,000 tons generally only takes four to six months from determining the task to laying the keel on the slipway. China does not have many designers, and they are scattered in various relevant units. If they can be used in a concentrated manner, when designing each type of ship, compare it with the same type of ship in the United Kingdom or other advanced countries in the world, and it is entirely possible to catch up with or exceed the United Kingdom in various economic indicators. In terms of scientific research, the United Kingdom currently has thirteen ship model test pools, the largest of which is the Haslar Naval Test Pool, which is 800 feet long (equivalent to 244 meters), and the maximum speed of the towing carriage is 40 feet per second (equivalent to 12.2 meters per second). China currently only has a small test pool that is 70 meters long (the new test pool of 100 meters long at Shanghai Shipbuilding College is not yet completed), and the maximum speed of the towing carriage is 5 meters per second.

From the simple situation of the shipbuilding industry in China and the United Kingdom mentioned above, we can see the prospects for China's shipbuilding industry to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom. All departments of China's national economy should develop in a planned way according to the needs of the country and the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. Therefore, it is not appropriate to compare the variety and quantity of products of China's shipbuilding industry, that is, from the aspect of quantity, with the United Kingdom. However, China has 11,000 kilometers of coastline and hundreds of thousands of kilometers of navigable rivers. We can greatly develop coastal and inland river transportation to meet the needs of developing agriculture and developing aquaculture, and strive to rapidly surpass the United Kingdom in the number of inland river ship manufacturing; in improving production organization and management, shortening production cycles, reducing costs, improving quality, and improving design levels and strengthening scientific research in the shipbuilding industry, we are confident that we can catch up with or exceed the United Kingdom within fifteen years.

Future Tasks of China's Shipbuilding Industry

In order to complete this task, we believe that:

First, we must do a good job in overall planning. First of all, we must coordinate with the transportation department, try to determine the ship type, and roughly determine the long-term and annual needs during the Second Five-Year Plan, so as to plan for small-batch or mass production and standardization and serialization, so as to stabilize product plans, shorten production cycles, and reduce costs.

Second, we must vigorously develop the collaborative industries related to the shipbuilding industry. We must consider mass production of various marine steel, light alloys, and plastics with better performance in strength and other aspects, and strive to improve the quality of rust-proof and anti-corrosion paints; we must seize the production of large diesel engines, steam turbines, and gas turbines, and start research on the manufacture of atomic power machinery; establish a production base for precision marine instruments, and gradually manufacture electronic navigation equipment and automatic control equipment, such as gyro compasses, anti-rolling devices, radars, radio direction finders, automatic pilots, variable pitch propellers, etc. We also hope to develop Shanghai into a collaborative base for the shipbuilding industry, which we believe is an important condition for catching up with the United Kingdom.

Third, strengthen product design and carry out scientific research work. At present, China's shipbuilding industry's design strength is weak and scattered, such as the design office of the Shipbuilding Industry Bureau, the design bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and the design sections of each shipyard. Therefore, we must first enrich and strengthen the design team and reasonably adjust the design institutions. We can consider concentrating the design strength and establishing a general design bureau for ships. We should strive to finalize the design of ships as early as possible, the types should not be too many, the number of drawings should also be simplified, parts should be standardized and universal as much as possible, and we should strive to reduce changes as much as possible in the design process to shorten the design cycle and improve the design level. According to the needs of China's national economic development, we should carry out scientific research work on various types of ships, require research equipment to gradually reach the international level, and establish a modern ship science test base in a planned way. Shipbuilding technology, like other industries, is developing rapidly. In order to implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, we should put more effort into shipbuilding technology to avoid falling behind.

At present, the level of China's shipbuilding industry is still relatively backward; however, we must spur the horse and work hard to catch up with the advanced international level. We have unparalleled superior conditions: we have the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the comprehensive and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union; in particular, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of workers has been universally improved after the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, and the enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high, and creative achievements have emerged one after another. Therefore, we are confident and determined to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in China's shipbuilding industry within fifteen years and strive to shorten the time. Let us join hands, muster revolutionary spirit, and strive to complete this glorious and arduous task!

    快马加鞭，让我国造船工业赶上世界先进水平
    杨俊生　萨本炘代表谈我国造船工业的远景
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告，并建议大会予以通过。
    我们伟大祖国已经进入发展国民经济第二个五年计划的第一年，这将是国民经济有一个新的跃进的一年。党中央和毛主席号召我们要在十五年或者更多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。这一响亮的号召，已经成为推动我国工业大跃进的巨大动力和鼓舞力量。各个行业都在根据本身的条件，提出具体的行动规划，以实际行动来响应党的伟大号召。我们是造船工业的技术人员，特就造船工业如何在十五年内赶上英国的问题，发表一些意见。
    我国和英国造船工业情况的比较
    首先，我们从以下几个方面来分析一下我国和英国造船工业的基本情况。
    第一，关于商船拥有量。英国一九○六年商船拥有量为一千六百三十八万一千总吨，占世界商船总吨位的百分之四十三；一九五六年拥有量为一千九百五十四万六千总吨，占世界商船总吨位的百分之十八。这些数字说明：英国商船拥有量总的趋势虽是增加的，但其增加的速度是极其缓慢的。从一九○六年到一九五六年五十年内共增加了三百一十六万五千总吨，平均每年只增加六万总吨。我国在解放前的商船拥有量约为一百二十万总吨。解放时大部分商船都被国民党反动派破坏和掳去。经过八年来的修建和恢复，目前我国商船拥有量还没有恢复到解放前的水平。
    第二，关于年产量。英国现有造船厂一百三十余家，造船从业人员二十余万。根据现有资料，一九四八年英国下水船舶为一百一十七万六千总吨，占世界下水船舶总吨的百分之五十；一九五六年下水船舶为一百三十八万三千总吨，占世界下水船舶总吨的百分之二十。从以上数字可以看出，英国船舶年产量约在一百三十万至一百四十万总吨之间。英国生产的船舶约有百分之六十到七十是为外国制造的。我国现有船厂以目前民用船舶的生产能力计算，在第二个第三个五年计划中关于造船的计划决定后，年产量一定可以达到相当惊人的数字。
    第三，关于造价和生产周期。英国的造船价格是逐年上升的。以载重量九千五百吨的货轮价格为例：一九四五年建造成本为每艘二十六万五千镑，为了对外竞争，出售价格为每艘二十四万；一九五七年每艘建造成本为七十七万五千镑，出售价格为九十万镑。我国尚未建造过大型船舶。根据粗略估计，第一艘新型万吨货轮出厂价格约为一千二百万元，较英国类似规格的船舶售价高出较多。但是必须说明：这是试制产品的价格。在正式生产时，是成批制造定型产品，可以有廉价的国产钢材、机器、仪表等供应，加以设计、建造、管理水平的提高，成本会下降很多。如能降低百分之三十到四十，即略等于英国现在的造价。要在十五年内达到这样的水平，是没有问题的。在造船周期上，英国建造一艘万吨级货轮，生产周期约为十二到十五个月。我国自造的万吨级远洋货轮计划周期为二十一到二十三个月，成批生产后可减少为十五到十八个月。最近，我们在上海讨论万吨级船的生产周期，曾提出奋斗目标为十个月。我们认为：只要抓紧做好生产准备工作，并得到有关协作工业部门的密切配合，在十五年内达到这个标准也是不成问题的。
    第四，关于采用新技术和新装备问题。英国船厂的建设年代一般都在十九世纪末期到二十世纪初叶，设备都很陈旧，新增添的设备不多。在采用新技术方面是比较保守的。到目前为止，采用铆接与焊接混合结构的还占相当大的比重。我国在采用新工艺技术、新装备、安装工艺和船壳制造方面，目前有些地方已超过英国。
    第五，关于产品质量。由于我国还没有建造大型船舶，因此，很难就大型船只的质量和英国比较。但造船工业是综合性工业，它的产品质量在很多方面是依靠协作厂的。船舶中的主要器材如中锰钢等的优质钢材、低速大型柴油机、汽轮机、燃汽轮机以及进一步使用原子能等，是要靠钢铁工业、机械工业等厂协作的；其他如辅机、仪表、电机、防火材料等也都要其他厂供应。至于决定船舶质量的另一个方面即施工和工艺质量，最近波兰代表团在上海参观江南造船厂时，认为中国船厂在施工和工艺质量方面已经超过英国。因此，只要协作厂的产品质量能够在十五年内赶上或者超过英国，造船工业的产品质量是可以保证在十五年内赶上或者超过英国的。
    第六，关于产品设计和科学研究。英国造船工业的产品设计是在船厂进行的，没有独立的设计机构。全国约有设计人员三千到五千人。英国的船舶设计工作没有我国目前做得细致，但由于经验多、资料多、工人技术熟练，施工图纸数量很少，因而整个设计周期比我们短。一条载重一万吨的货轮，从确定任务到铺龙骨上船台，一般只要四至六个月。我国设计人员不多，且分散在各有关单位。如果能够集中使用，在设计每一种船只时，针对英国或世界其他先进国家的同种类型船只作比较，在各种经济指标方面赶上英国或者超过英国是完全可以做到的。在科学研究方面，英国现有船模试验池十三个，其中最大的海斯勒海军试验池长八百英尺（合二百四十四公尺），曳引车最高速度为每秒四十英尺（合每秒十二点二公尺）。我国目前仅有一座小型试验池，长七十公尺（上海造船学院新建长一百公尺的试验池尚未完工），曳引车最高速度为每秒五公尺。
    从以上所说我国和英国造船工业的简单情况，可以看出我国造船工业赶上或者超过英国的远景。我国国民经济各部门应该根据国家的需要和多快好省的原则，有计划地发展。因此，我国造船工业的产品品种和数量，即从多这一方面和英国比较，是不适宜的。但我国有一万一千公里海岸线，几十万公里可通航运的河道，我们可大量发展沿海和内河运输，以适应发展农业、发展水产的需要，争取在内河船舶制造数量上迅速超过英国；在造船工业的改善生产组织管理、缩短生产周期、降低成本、提高质量以及在提高设计水平和加强科学研究等方面，都是有把握在十五年以内赶上或者超过英国的。
    我国造船工业今后的任务
    为了完成这个任务，我们认为：
    第一，必须做好全面规划。首先，要和交通部门对好口径，尽量确定船型，大体确定第二个五年计划期间长远的和逐年的需要数字，以便小批或成批生产和进行标准化、系列化的规划，借以稳定产品计划、缩短生产周期和降低成本。
    第二，必须大力发展有关造船工业的协作工业。必须考虑大量生产在强度等方面性能较好的各种船用钢材、轻合金和塑料，努力提高防锈、防腐的油漆质量；必须抓紧生产大型柴油机、汽轮机和燃汽轮机，着手研究原子动力机械的制造；建立精密航海仪表的生产基地，逐步制造电子导航设备和自动控制装备，如电罗经、消摆仪、雷达、无线电测向仪、自动舵、可变螺距车叶等。我们还希望把上海市发展成为造船工业的协作基地，我们认为这也是赶上英国的一个重要条件。
    第三，加强产品设计和开展科学研究工作。目前，我国船舶工业的设计力量薄弱，而且分散各处，如船舶工业局有设计室，交通部有设计局，各船厂又有设计科，因此，首先必须充实和加强设计队伍，合理调整设计机构，可以考虑将设计力量集中使用，成立船舶设计总局。设计船只要争取及早定型，种类不宜过多，图纸数量亦应简化，零件等应尽量标准化、通用化，设计过程中应尽量争取减少变动，以缩短设计周期，提高设计水平。要根据我国国民经济发展的需要，对各种类型的船只进行科学研究工作，要求研究设备逐步达到国际水平，并有计划地建立现代化的船舶科学试验基地。造船工艺，同其他工业一样，也是日新月异地发展，为了执行多快好省的方针，我们应该在造船工艺方面多下一把劲，以免落后。
    目前，我国的造船工业水平还是比较落后的；但是，我们一定要快马加鞭，努力赶上国际先进水平。我们有着无比的优越条件：我们有党和毛主席的英明领导，有苏联全面的、无私的援助；特别是广大职工经过整风运动和反右派斗争，社会主义觉悟普遍提高，生产热情空前高涨，创造性的成就相继涌现。因此，我们是有信心、有决心在十五年内并力争缩短时间使我国的造船工业赶上并超过英国的。让我们携起手来，鼓起革命干劲，为完成这一光荣、艰巨的任务而努力奋斗吧！
