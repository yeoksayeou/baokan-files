　　In the Face of Facts
　　——Lotus Society Mobilizes the Masses to Eliminate the Four Pests Through Exhibitions and Visits
　　Cheng Wanli Sun Haiyun
　　In the mountainous area of Jiming Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, there is a Lotus Agricultural Production Cooperative. This cooperative has twenty-four villages of various sizes, one hundred and twenty households, and five hundred and forty-two people. Now, not a single sparrow, rat, fly, or mosquito can be found here. People praise the Lotus Society, saying, "This is truly an unimaginable event; the Lotus Society has brought about a new atmosphere unseen for thousands of years!"

　　The Former Appearance
　　In the past, the members of the Lotus Society did not believe in hygiene. For many years, the twenty-plus villages in this cooperative had people and livestock living together. Upon entering a gate, it was either a cattle pen or a pigsty. Open-air toilets and manure pits were everywhere in the villages, and piles of garbage accumulated around houses, with weeds growing everywhere and livestock manure covering the ground. Whenever it rained, manure and urine flowed everywhere, and in the summer, the stench was overwhelming, with swarms of mosquitoes and flies. In the past, people had composed a jingle for the Huawu Village of this cooperative: "Upon entering Huawu Village, the stench rises up; the kitchen is where the pigs sleep, and the hall is where the cattle are kept!" This jingle not only summarized the sanitary conditions of Huawu Village but also served as a microcosm of the other twenty-plus villages! Due to the poor sanitary environment, diseases had once spread like epidemics here, taking many lives. In 1934 alone, when smallpox broke out in Huawu Village, eight out of seventeen people in the entire village died within two months! Two children of farmer Wang Shaotang were taken by death in two consecutive days! After liberation, with the care and help of the Party and the government, many sanitation campaigns were carried out here, eradicating smallpox and cholera. However, people still lacked an understanding of carrying out regular sanitation work. Therefore, many other diseases, such as malaria, typhoid fever, dysentery, enteritis, etc., still prevailed here. According to a survey in the autumn of 1955, out of the five hundred and forty-two people in the entire cooperative, five hundred and six suffered from malaria. Sixteen out of eighteen laborers in the fourth production team fell ill. "The crops in the fields are unattended, and many families have no smoke from the kitchen," this was the tragic portrayal of the Lotus Society at that time. In such a serious situation, many cooperative members still believed in "fate," regarding it as "heaven-ordained" and arranged by "spirits." They placed their hopes on "Bodhisattvas." Cooperative members Wang Youkun and Wang Shaowei, in order to escape the pain of years of illness, neglected production every year, crossed mountains and ridges, and spent a lot of money to seek gods and worship Buddha at Guanyin Mountain in Luotian County. However, the Bodhisattvas did not bestow blessings and disaster relief upon them. They still suffered from malaria for several years in a row, tormented until their backs ached, their arms were weak, and their faces were sallow and emaciated.

　　A Physical Exhibit
　　The good news of the National Agricultural Development Program spread to the Lotus Society, and the cadres were very excited. They thought that to change the backward appearance of the cooperative and promote great development in production, it was necessary to eradicate diseases and improve and protect labor power. Therefore, they were determined to do a good job in sanitation and eliminate the four pests. Subsequently, the cooperative established a Health Committee, which included five groups: propaganda, environmental sanitation, rat and sparrow elimination, maternal and child health, and inspection. However, despite the leadership taking action and the cadres taking the lead, the number of people participating was always small. At this time, some people in the masses said: "People eat five grains of rice, how can they not get sick!" "Rats can burrow into the ground, sparrows can fly to the sky, how many flies and mosquitoes are there, how can they be eliminated!" "We have never engaged in sanitation for generations, and we still live the same way!" Some cadres began to slack off after hearing these rumors. The cooperative leadership promptly studied this situation and believed that the main reason was that the ideological work was not done enough. Therefore, the masses still did not clearly understand the importance of sanitation and eliminating the four pests. Therefore, they immediately held a physical exhibition in the cooperative to organize cooperative members and cadres to visit. At the exhibition, the masses saw many clothes and furniture that had been damaged by rats; learned about the population mortality and labor force decline in the cooperative over the past few years; and learned that the total amount of grain damaged by rats and sparrows in the entire cooperative last year alone was more than 26,600 jin. These vivid facts aroused the hatred of the cooperative members towards the four pests and established their determination to do a good job in sanitation. Communist Youth League member Xu Xiuying cried bitterly when she saw that a new floral blouse of hers had been bitten with two holes by rats, and the cabinets and mosquito nets in her home had also been bitten with holes everywhere. She said: "I must be an activist in eliminating the four pests!" Many elderly cooperative members also said: "Normally, we don't feel it in each family, but when gathered together like this, the four pests are really harmful. If we don't eliminate them, it will be terrible!" Since then, a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests has initially taken root in the masses of the Lotus Society!

　　Two Propaganda Fields
　　After the exhibition, the ideological understanding of the cooperative members improved, but the enthusiasm of the people for eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene was still not great, and it was extremely infrequent. The reason was that many people had concerns in their minds and were afraid of delaying production. For example, some people reflected: "The four pests must be eliminated, and sanitation must be done, but now production is busy, and manpower cannot be spared. The heart is willing but the strength is not enough!" In order to dispel the concerns of the masses, in addition to combining the propaganda of doing sanitation work not only does not affect production but also can promote production with civil school classes and publishing big-character posters and blackboard newspapers, Comrade Wang Zhengguo, the finance director, also specially cultivated two fields (1.5 mu) with more than 2,000 dan of sludge taken from cleaning the gutters, soil dug from around the manure tanks of relocated toilets, and sanitary fertilizer accumulated from cleaning. Because the fertilizer was sufficient, the seedlings in these two fields grew particularly strong and lovely and were rated as first-class seedlings. Cooperative Director Wang Youbin happily said: "These are two of the best propaganda fields." He immediately organized the entire cooperative to visit, so that the masses could see what benefits sanitation brought. Facts are the most convincing. After the visit, the cooperative members said: "Seeing is believing, this mu of land will produce at least a thousand jin of grain! This is really a good thing that kills two birds with one stone!"

　　Determining Remuneration and Establishing Systems
　　On the basis of improving understanding and dispelling concerns, the cooperative committee promptly stipulated labor remuneration. For example, building toilets was recorded as work points according to the base points, accumulating four dan of gutter sludge fertilizer was recorded as one work point, digging earthworm soil three dan was recorded as one work point, and digging topsoil and removing weeds was generally three dan per work point. Therefore, the cooperative members were more motivated and in higher spirits to do sanitation and eliminate the four pests. Their slogan was: "Mobilize every household, start with everyone, and don't stop eliminating the four pests!" Through more than ten shock campaigns, in the first half of last year, the entire cooperative eliminated open-air toilets, basically achieved cattle having pens, pigs having sties, chickens having cages, people having toilets, manure tanks having lids, and every household having no rat holes and no sparrow nests. The weeds in front of and behind the villages were swept away, and all the gutters were cleaned. The decades-old stinky courtyards also turned over. All one hundred and twenty households in the cooperative prepared more than 320 pieces of equipment for trapping and eliminating rats and sparrows. In order to ensure that sanitation work could be maintained regularly and achieve the complete eradication of the four pests, in addition to further strengthening the leadership of the sanitation work, the Party branch and the Communist Youth League organization also formulated a working system of a small cleaning every day, a big cleaning every seven days, a monthly inspection, and a bi-monthly evaluation, with rewards for the good and criticism for the bad. Now, more than forty young activists have emerged in the Lotus Society. Communist Youth League member Xu Xiuying caught and killed more than 860 rats and sparrows in a year, and 13-year-old Wang Jianping caught and killed more than 770 rats and sparrows in a year. Last year, the entire cooperative caught and killed more than 7,500 rats and more than 500 sparrows, and accumulated 25,700 dan of sanitary fertilizer in half a year. Rats, sparrows, and mosquitoes and flies can no longer be seen here. The cooperative members happily said: "In our Lotus Society, rats and sparrows have been eradicated, and mosquitoes and flies are not seen. It really looks like a new countryside!"

　　A New Atmosphere
　　A new atmosphere has emerged in the Lotus Society! People feel a fresh and refreshing atmosphere when they enter that village. Washing quilts and cleaning frequently have become a way of life for every cooperative member. Many diseases have also disappeared, such as malaria, which used to be very prevalent. The number of cases in 1956 decreased from 506 in 1955 to eight, and the number of cases last year was only two. No one in the entire cooperative suffered from diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, or enteritis. Last year, the labor attendance rate in the cooperative was often maintained above 95%, and even the old sick people Wang Youkun and Wang Shaowei each did more than 4,000 work points, an increase of more than double compared to 1955. The reduction of diseases and the improvement of labor brought significant changes to production. The average yield per mu of grain increased from 490 jin per mu in 1955 to 536 jin in 1956, and then increased to 606 jin last year. Another exciting thing is that last year, the cooperative used the 66,800 dan of fertilizer accumulated from sanitation to specially cultivate 38.6 mu of land. At the autumn harvest, the average yield per mu of 8.1 mu was 1,100 jin, the average yield per mu of 12.5 mu was 1,000 jin, and the average yield per mu of 18 mu was 800 jin. "More than a thousand jin per mu," something that the mountain people have not dared to dream of for thousands of years, has now become a living reality. The cooperative members of the Lotus Society confidently said: "Now we are strong and healthy, and this year's production must have a great leap forward. The average yield per mu must be a thousand jin!" Wang Shaowei and Wang Youkun, who have always been superstitious about "fate" and "gods," said even more movingly, "In the past, we burned incense and worshiped Buddha, diagnosed diseases and sought blessings. It seems that we were really seeing ghosts. It was not 'gods' that gave the people happiness, but the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!"

　　在事实面前
　　——莲花社通过展览、参观发动群众除四害
　　程万里　孙海云
    在湖北省浠水县鸡鸣乡的山区里，有一个莲花农业生产合作社。这个社有二十四个大小垸子，一百二十户，五百四十二人。现在，这里已经找不到一只麻雀、老鼠、苍蝇和蚊子。人们赞扬莲花社说：“这真是梦想不到的事，莲花社出现了几千年来所没有的新气象！”
    昔日的面貌
    过去，莲花社的社员们是不相信卫生的。这个社的二十多个垸子，多少年来，都是人畜同居，一进大门不是牛栏，就是猪窝，垸子里露天厕所、粪窖林立，屋前屋后垃圾成堆，杂草丛生，畜粪满地，每逢天雨，粪尿横流，一到夏天，则臭气熏人，蚊蝇成群。过去，人们曾给这个社的花屋垸编了一首顺口溜：“一进花屋垸，臭气往上翻，厨房把猪睡，堂屋把牛关！”这首顺口溜，不仅概括了花屋垸的卫生面貌，同时也是其他二十多个垸子的缩影！由于卫生环境恶劣，疾病曾像瘟疫一样在这里流行，葬送了不少人的生命。仅1934年花屋垸流行天花，全垸十七口人，在两个月内就死去了八人，农民王少堂的两个孩子，两天中连续被夺去生命！解放后，在党和政府的关怀和帮助下，这里也进行了不少卫生活动，根绝了天花、霍乱。但是，人们对开展经常性的卫生工作还缺乏认识，因此，其他许多疾病，如疟疾、伤寒、痢疾、肠炎等，仍在这里流行。据1955年秋天调查，全社五百四十二人中，患疟疾的五百零六人。第四生产队十八个劳动力，就病倒了十六人。“田里庄稼无人问，许多家里没炊烟”，这是当时莲花社的悲惨写照。在这样严重情况下，不少社员仍然迷信“命运”，把这看成是“天定”的，是“神灵”的安排，他们把希望寄托在“菩萨”身上。社员王幼坤、王绍为，为了摆脱多年的疾病痛苦，年年丢下生产，翻山越岭，花了不少钱，到罗田县观音山去求神拜佛。可是，菩萨没有给他们赐福免灾，他们还是连续患了几年疟疾，被折磨得腰酸臂软，面黄肌瘦。
    一次实物展览会
    全国农业发展纲要的喜讯传到了莲花社，干部们十分兴奋。他们想，要改变社的落后面貌，促进生产大发展，必须根治病害，提高和保护劳动力。于是，他们下定决心要搞好卫生，消灭四害。接着，社里成立了卫生委员会，下设宣传、环境卫生、捕灭鼠雀、妇幼卫生和检查等五个小组。但是，尽管领导动手，干部带头，参加的人总是不多。这时，群众中有些人说：“人吃五谷米，那能不生病！”“老鼠会钻地，麻雀会上天，苍蝇、蚊子该几多，怎么灭得了！”“我们世世代代没搞卫生，还不是一样过日子！”有的干部听了这些风言风语，也开始松劲了。社领导及时研究了这个情况，认为主要是思想工作做得不够，因此，群众对搞卫生、除四害的重要性还认识不清。于是，他们马上在社里举办了一个实物展览会，组织社员和干部参观。展览会上，群众看到了许多被老鼠咬坏的衣服、家具；了解了社里几年来人口死亡和劳动力下降的情况；知道了全社仅去年一年共被老鼠、麻雀损耗的粮食就有两万六千六百多斤。这些生动的事实，激起了社员们对四害的仇恨，树立了搞好卫生的决心。共青团员徐秀英看到自己的一件新花褂子被老鼠咬了两个窟眼，家里的厨柜、蚊帐也被老鼠咬的东一个洞，西一个孔，气得大哭一场，她说：“我一定要做个除四害积极分子！”许多老年社员也说：“平时一家一户不觉得，这样集中起来，四害真是害人精，不消灭还了得！”从此，一个以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，在莲花社的群众中，初步落了脚，生了根！
    两丘宣传田
    展览会后，社员们的思想认识提高了，但是，人们除四害、讲卫生的劲头仍然不太大，而且极不经常。原因是：许多人思想有顾虑，怕误了生产。如有人反映：“四害要灭，卫生要搞，就是现在生产忙，人手扯不开，心有余而力不足！”为了解除群众的顾虑，社里一面结合民校上课和出大字报、黑板报宣传搞卫生工作不仅不影响生产，而且可以推动生产外，并且由财经主任王正国同志，将清洗阴沟取出的污泥，迁移厕所挖出粪缸周围的泥土，和打扫清洁所积的卫生肥料共两千多担，专门培育了两丘（一点五亩）田。由于肥施得足，这两丘田的秧苗长得特别茁壮可爱，被评为一类苗，社主任王幼彬高兴地说：“这是两丘最好的宣传田。”他马上组织全社群众参观，让群众看搞卫生所带来的好处究竟是什么。事实是最有说服力的，参观后，社员们说：“百闻不如一见，这一亩田起码要产千把斤粮！这真是一举两得的好事！”
    定报酬、订制度
    在提高认识解除顾虑的基础上，社委会又及时地规定了劳动报酬，如修建厕所按底分记工，积四担阴沟泥肥记工一分，挖蛹土三担记一分，挖地皮和铲杂草一般是三担一分等。因此，社员们搞卫生，除四害的劲头更足，情绪更高。他们的口号是：“户户动员，人人动手，不灭四害不收兵！”通过十多次突击运动，在去年上半年全社就消灭了露天厕所，基本上做到牛有栏，猪有圈，鸡有笼，人有厕所，粪缸有盖，和家家无鼠洞，户户无雀窝，垸前垸后杂草一扫光，全部阴沟也都进行了清理，几十年的臭天井也翻了身。全社有一百二十户置备了捕灭鼠雀工具三百二十多件。为了使卫生工作能够坚持经常，达到彻底根除四害，党支部和团的组织，除了进一步加强对卫生工作的领导外，并且制订了每天一小扫，七天一大扫，每月一检查，两月一评比和好的奖励，坏的批评等工作制度。现在，莲花社出现了四十多个青年积极分子，共青团员徐秀英，一年捕灭鼠雀八百六十多只，十三岁的王建平，一年捕鼠雀七百七十多只。去年全社共捕灭了老鼠七千五百多只，麻雀五百多只，半年积卫生肥料二万五千七百多担。这里再也看不到鼠雀和蚊蝇。社员们高兴地说：“我们莲花社，老鼠、麻雀断了根，苍蝇、蚊子不见影，真像个新农村样子！”
    一片新气象
    莲花社出现了一片新气象！人们走进那个垸子，都感到一股清新爽人的气氛。勤洗衣被、勤打扫，已成为每个社员的生活习惯。许多疾病也一去不复返了，如一向大量流行的疟疾，1956年的发病人数由1955年的五百零六人下降为八人，去年发病人数仅二人，全社没有一人生痢疾、伤寒、肠炎等疾病。去年社里的劳动出勤率经常保持在95％以上，连几年来的老病号王幼坤、王绍为每人都做了四千多分，比1955年增长了一倍多。疾病的减少，劳力的提高，给生产带来了显著变化，粮食平均亩产量，由1955年的亩产四百九十斤上升到1956年的五百三十六斤，去年又上升到六百零六斤。另一件使人兴奋的事是：去年社里将搞卫生积的六万六千八百担肥料，专门培育了三十八亩六分田，秋收时，其中八亩一分平均亩产一千一百斤，有十二亩五分平均亩产一千斤，有十八亩平均亩产八百斤。“亩产千余斤”，几千年来山村人民所不敢梦想的事，如今也成为活生生的现实了。莲花社的社员们满怀信心地说：“现在我们是人强马壮，今年的生产一定要来个大跃进，平均亩产要搞个千把斤！”一向迷信于“命运”和“神”的王绍为、王幼坤说得更为动人，他们说：“过去，我们烧香拜佛，诊病求福，看来真是活见鬼，给人民幸福的原来不是‘神’，而是共产党、毛主席！”
