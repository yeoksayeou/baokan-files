　　Xinhua News Agency, Kunming - Yunnan Province is now self-sufficient in raw coal, and it is estimated that there will be a surplus this year.

　　Yunnan has abundant coal reserves, with coal mines in every county. However, Yunnan's raw coal self-sufficiency only began in 1957. Prior to that, coal was in short supply for both factories and civilian use. In 1956, the relevant leadership departments in Yunnan Province, in accordance with the principle of "combining large, medium, and small-sized operations," actively and boldly developed a number of coal mines, expanding from the original five or six old coal mines to ninety-seven. With the exception of one coal mine that was developed with central government investment, the rest were established by the province and various special districts and counties using their own funds. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives in various places also opened a large number of small coal kilns.

　　Last year, the province produced more than two million tons of raw coal, basically meeting the needs of various factories, mines, construction units, and civilian use. Many factories and mines, and the vast majority of urban and rural residents, began to use coal instead of wood as fuel, saving timber. According to the plan of the Provincial Statistics Department, this year's raw coal production, in addition to fully meeting the needs of existing and newly-built industrial and mining construction units and civilian use, can also have a surplus of more than 100,000 tons.

### 云南原煤自给有余

　　云南原煤自给有余
    新华社昆明电　云南省原煤已能自给，今年估计还可以节余。
    云南煤的蕴藏量十分丰富，每个县都有煤矿。但是云南原煤能够自给是从1957年开始的；在此以前，工厂和民间用煤都很紧张。1956年，云南省有关领导部门，根据“大、中、小型相结合”的方针，积极放手发展了一批煤矿，由原来的五、六个老煤矿发展到九十七个，其中除了一个煤矿是中央投资开采的以外，其他都由省和各专区、县自筹经费开设。与此同时，各地农业社也开采了大批小煤窑。
    去年全省共生产原煤二百多万吨，基本满足各厂矿基建单位及民用的需要。许多厂矿和绝大多数地区的城乡居民，开始用煤代替木材作燃料，节约了木材。根据省统计部门的计划，今年原煤的生产量除了能充分满足原有和新建的工矿基建单位及民用需要以外，还可以节余十多万吨。
