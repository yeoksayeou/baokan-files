　　Sichuan peasants invest in building fertilizer plants

　　(Our newspaper, Chengdu, 8th) Sichuan Province's agricultural cooperatives will invest 150 million yuan during the Second Five-Year Plan to develop the production of small-scale chemical fertilizers and miscellaneous fertilizers, accounting for three-quarters of the province's total investment in fertilizer production. This investment by the agricultural cooperatives will be accumulated by each member contributing ten eggs (equivalent to 50 cents) per year. This will not only expand the public accumulation of the agricultural cooperatives, which is conducive to the development of agricultural production, but also save the country investment. The plan stipulates that by 1962, the total output of various chemical fertilizers and miscellaneous fertilizers in the province will greatly exceed the 500,000 tons stipulated in the Forty Articles of the Sichuan Agricultural Development Program, and strive to reach and exceed 1 million tons.

　　Sichuan's fertilizer industry has greatly developed during the First Five-Year Plan. The total output in 1952 was only more than 1,700 tons, which increased to more than 126,000 tons in 1957. However, the average application of chemical fertilizer per mu of cultivated land in the province is only one kilogram, accounting for 8 per thousand of the total fertilizer application. Therefore, the province's chemical fertilizer industry needs to have a great leap forward to promote the great development of agricultural production. Now, all relevant departments in the province are trying their best to open up chemical fertilizer resources. Recently, the extraction of ammonium sulfate from sulfur waste residue has been successfully tested, and 6 jin can be extracted from every 100 jin of waste residue. With this item alone, 6,000 tons of ammonium sulfate can be produced by 1962. The extraction of phosphate fertilizer from steel waste residue and the extraction of potassium magnesium phosphate fertilizer from phosphate rock powder have all been successfully tested.

　　According to Sichuan's plan for developing various chemical fertilizers and miscellaneous fertilizers, the main chemical fertilizers such as calcium cyanamide, potassium magnesium phosphate fertilizer, ammonium sulfate, and steel slag phosphate fertilizer will be increased. Most of the province's special districts and autonomous prefectures will rely on the strength of the masses and use waste materials to establish some miscellaneous fertilizer factories such as bone meal and granular fertilizer. With this item alone, 235,000 tons can be produced by 1962. Suining, Nanchong, and Daxian special districts have decided to adopt the method of mutual support and cooperation, concentrating the investment of the masses in the three special districts every year to build three fertilizer plants in turn.

　　This year, the province's chemical fertilizer production task is 226,000 tons, an increase of 78% over last year. Among them, calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer increased by 34 times.

　　四川农民投资兴建肥料厂
    本报成都8日电　四川省农业社在第二个五年计划内投资一亿五千万元发展小型化学肥料和杂肥生产，占全省肥料生产总投资额的四分之三。农业社的这笔投资，将由每个社员每年出十个鸡蛋（合五角钱）积储起来。这不但扩大了农业社的公共积累，有利于发展农业生产，同时也为国家节省了投资。计划规定，1962年全省各种化肥和杂肥的总产量将大大超过四川农业发展纲要四十条规定的五十万吨，并争取达到和超过一百万吨。
    四川化肥工业在第一个五年计划内有很大的发展。1952年总产量只有一千七百多吨，到1957年增长到十二点六万多吨。但是全省耕地平均每亩施用化肥只有一公斤，占施肥总量的千分之八。因此，全省化学肥料工业需要有个大跃进，以促进农业生产的大发展。现在全省各有关部门正想尽各种办法开辟化肥资源。最近，从硫磺废渣中提取硫酸錏已试验成功，每百斤废渣可提出六斤。仅此一项，到1962年即可生产硫酸錏六千吨。从钢铁废渣中提取磷肥，从磷矿粉中提取钾镁磷肥，都已试验成功。
    按照四川发展各种化肥和杂肥的规划，将增加碳氮化钙、钾镁磷肥、硫酸錏、钢渣磷肥等主要化学肥料。全省大部分专区、自治州，将依靠群众力量，利用废料建立一些骨粉、颗粒肥料等杂肥工厂。单是这一项，到1962年就能生产二十三点五万吨。遂宁、南充、达县三个专区已决定采用互相支援协作的办法，每年集中三个专区的群众投资，依次建立三个肥料厂。
    今年全省化肥生产任务是二十二点六万吨，比去年增长78％。其中钙镁磷肥增长三十四倍。
