　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 1st – At the plenary session of the House of Councillors on the morning of January 31, Japanese Socialist Party member Tokuji Kameda exposed the US conspiracy to turn Japan into an atomic war base.

　　He pointed out that through the US-Japan "joint defense," Japan has been incorporated into the US atomic strategic system. US forces in the Pacific region are also being fully equipped with atomic weapons. He said that US planes carrying atomic bombs are patrolling over Japan. These US B-47 bombers are from Guam bases. He asked the Japanese government to explain the truth of these issues.

　　Kameda also asked Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi if he intended to visit the Soviet Union and China to understand these countries' desire to call for peaceful coexistence.

　　In his response, Nobusuke Kishi said that he had no intention of revising the US-Japan Security Treaty. He also said that he was not satisfied with maintaining the temporary peace with the "balance of power," and must strive to establish lasting peace through negotiation. However, he has no intention of visiting China and the Soviet Union immediately.

　　Director-General of the Defense Agency, Toshio Tsushima, responded to the issue of US atomic war preparations in Japan and the Pacific region. He said that regarding the US atomic equipment in the Pacific region, he could not provide any explanation other than what has been publicly announced. He also did not know about planes carrying atomic bombs patrolling over Japan.

　　At the afternoon session of the House of Councillors that day, the parliamentarians' inquiries focused on economic issues.

　　Socialist Party member Kanemitsu Tabata pointed out that Japan's economic "boom" has changed into a recession. He demanded measures to provide relief to unemployed workers, reduce prices, and reduce taxes for working people. He also demanded the restoration of the right to strike for civil servants and public enterprise employees. Green Breeze Society member Bunkichi Tamura expressed the hope to restore Japanese trade with China and hoped that the United States would reconsider restricting the import of Japanese goods. He pointed out that the current export volume of countries around the world has increased compared to 1937, but Japan has decreased instead.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 31st – TASS reported that the "Pravda" published an abstract of its reporter's conversation with Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party.

　　When talking about the Socialist Party's campaign platform for the upcoming general election, Suzuki Mosaburo pointed out that the Japanese Socialists advocate that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet fundamentally change its foreign policy, which still completely relies on the United States. The Socialist Party demands the abolition of nuclear weapons bases in the Far East and advocates the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between Eastern and Western countries within the scope of the Far East. The Socialist Party will strive to normalize diplomatic relations between Japan and China and expand trade with the Soviet Union and China.

　　Suzuki Mosaburo believes that the realization of socialism on a global scale largely depends on whether the Socialist parties in various countries can achieve victory. He said that the Japanese Socialist Party hopes that the Socialist parties in Western Europe can abandon their colonialist stance and not become supporters of US imperialism. The Japanese Socialists hope that these parties will stand on the position of genuine socialism on the issue of peace.

　　日本社会党议员揭露
    美国阴谋变日本为原子战基地
    铃木茂三郎主张改变依赖美国的政策
    据新华社1日讯　东京消息：在1月31日上午参议院全体会议上，日本社会党议员龟田得治揭露了美国把日本变成原子战争基地的阴谋。
    他指出，通过日美“共同防御”，日本已经被纳入美国的原子战略体系。太平洋地区的美军也正在全面装备原子武器。他说，携带着原子弹的美国飞机在日本上空巡逻。这些美国B—四七型轰炸机是来自关岛基地的。他要求日本政府说明这些问题的真实情况。
    龟田还问岸信介首相是否有意访问苏联和中国，以了解这些国家呼吁和平共处的意愿。
    岸信介在答辩的时候说，他无意修改日美安全条约。他又说，他不满足于以“实力平衡”保持暂时和平的现状，必须努力用协商方式建立持久和平。但是，他无意在现在立刻访问中国和苏联。
    防卫厅长官津岛寿一对美国在日本和太平洋地区进行原子战争准备的问题作了答复。他说，关于美军在太平洋地区的原子装备的问题，除了公开宣布的以外，不能加以说明。他也不知道关于载有原子弹的飞机正在日本上空巡逻的事情。
    在参议院当天下午的会议上，议员们的质询集中在经济问题方面。
    社会党人田畑金光指出，日本的经济“景气”已经一变而成为衰退。他要求采取办法救济失业工人，为劳动人民减低物价和减税。他还要求恢复公务人员和公共企业机关职工的罢工权利。绿风会议员田村文吉表示，希望恢复日本对中国的贸易，并且希望美国重新考虑限制日本商品进口的问题。他指出，世界各国目前的出口额都比1937年增加了，可是，日本反而减少了。
    据新华社1日讯　塔斯社莫斯科1月31日讯：“真理报”登载了它的记者同日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎谈话的摘要。
    铃木茂三郎在谈到社会党在将要举行的大选中的竞选政纲时指出，日本社会党人主张岸信介内阁根本改变依然完全依赖美国的外交政策。社会党要求取消在远东的核武器基地，主张在远东范围内缔结东西方国家之间的互不侵犯协定。社会党将争取使日中两国外交关系正常化，并且扩大同苏联和中国的贸易。
    铃木茂三郎认为，社会主义在世界范围内的实现在很大程度上取决于各个国家里的社会党是否能取得胜利。他说，日本社会党希望西欧各国社会党能放弃这种殖民主义立场，不要变为美国帝国主义的拥护者。日本社会党人希望，这些党在和平问题上将站在真正的社会党的立场上。
