Report on the Current Work of Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme
Delivered at the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress on February 3, 1958
Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee

Fellow Deputies:

The draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has been discussed nationwide for two years. After repeated deliberation and revision by the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Review Committee established by the State Council, and after further discussion at an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in October 1957, it was adopted at the 60th plenary session of the State Council on November 1, 1957. It is now submitted to the National People's Congress for discussion and approval. I now, on behalf of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, present a report to the Congress on the current work of language reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme for your consideration.

I. The Tasks of Current Language Reform and the Work of Language Reform in Recent Years

The tasks of our country's current language reform, as far as the Han nationality is concerned, are: (1) to simplify Chinese characters, making them easier for the broad masses of people to master and use, so as to eliminate illiteracy more, better, faster, and more economically among the broad masses, and to popularize and improve culture; (2) to promote Mandarin Chinese, so as to eliminate dialectal barriers and promote the further unification of the Chinese language, enabling our language to better serve our country's socialist construction; (3) to formulate and promote the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, to provide phonetic notation for Chinese characters and to help promote Mandarin Chinese.

The work of language reform in recent years has been carried out in accordance with the above-mentioned principles.

First, let's talk about the simplification of Chinese characters.

After the national liberation, the government began research work on the simplification of Chinese characters. After the establishment of the Chinese Language Reform Research Committee in 1952, it began drafting the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme. In January 1955, the Chinese Language Reform Committee published the "Draft of the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme" to widely solicit opinions. More than 200,000 people from all walks of life across the country participated in the discussions. After the draft was preliminarily revised based on these opinions, and after review by the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme Review Committee established by the State Council, it was submitted to the National Language Reform Conference in October 1955 for discussion and approval. In January 1956, the State Council promulgated the "Chinese Character Simplification Scheme." This scheme includes three parts: the first part is the First Table of Simplified Chinese Characters, containing 230 simplified Chinese characters (that is, simplifying 245 traditional characters into 230 simplified characters; among them, two or three traditional characters are merged into one simplified character, so the number of characters after simplification is 15 less than before simplification), which have been in general use since the promulgation of the scheme; the second part is the Second Table of Simplified Chinese Characters, containing 285 simplified Chinese characters (that is, simplifying 299 traditional characters into 285 simplified characters, which is 14 less than before simplification due to merging), of which 95 characters have been in trial use since June 1956; the third part is the Table of Simplified Radicals, containing 54 simplified radicals, of which 30 characters inferred from this table have been in trial use since the promulgation of the scheme. In total, the simplified Chinese characters currently used in newspapers and periodicals amount to 355. In addition, there are 190 simplified Chinese characters belonging to the Second Table of Simplified Chinese Characters and most of the inferred characters of simplified radicals belonging to the third table that have not yet been used. However, some simplified Chinese characters used in a few publications exceed the scope of 355 characters. For example, in elementary school language textbooks and literacy materials, almost all three tables of the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme have been used.

Chinese characters have had simplified forms since the oracle bone script era, and simplified characters have developed in every era since then. Our work is only to carry out simplification in a more systematic way and to make simplified forms the standard forms. The benefits of adopting simplified Chinese characters are very significant. The 544 traditional characters simplified in the First and Second Tables of the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme have a total of 8,745 strokes, averaging 16.08 strokes per character; after simplification, they are merged into 515 simplified Chinese characters, with a total of 4,206 strokes, averaging only 8.16 strokes per character. That is to say, writing simplified Chinese characters requires half the effort of writing traditional characters. In these two tables, there were only 34 characters with 10 strokes or less before simplification, and the number increased to 409 after simplification. The number of characters with 11 strokes was 35 before and after simplification. The number of characters with 12 strokes or more was 475 before simplification and decreased to 71 after simplification. If the 515 simplified Chinese characters in the first and second tables are further simplified according to the radical simplification method in the third table, the average number of strokes per simplified Chinese character can be further reduced to an estimated 6.5 strokes, accounting for only slightly more than 40 percent of the average number of strokes of the original traditional characters. The promotion of simplified Chinese characters is of great benefit to children's education, literacy, and general writing, and is therefore warmly welcomed by the broad masses, especially young children.

Some right-wing elements took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to viciously attack the language reform, saying that the simplification of Chinese characters had been messed up and that the State Council should withdraw the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme. Simplifying Chinese characters is a good thing that is in line with the interests of the broad masses of people, and the anti-people right-wing elements naturally oppose it and describe it as a bad thing. From the standpoint of the interests of the broad masses of people, we should affirm that the simplification of Chinese characters has indeed done a good thing for hundreds of millions of children and illiterate people, and it has been done well rather than messed up.

However, on the other hand, it must be pointed out that there are indeed some shortcomings in the work of simplifying Chinese characters. Many comrades have put forward reasonable suggestions to us, hoping that we will consider them. We are very grateful to these enthusiastic people who have offered opinions. The facts of the past two years have proven that the simplification methods of a few Chinese characters in the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme, especially in terms of homophonic substitution, were not considered thoroughly enough, so they are not yet appropriate for use or may cause misunderstandings. For example, using "只" (zhǐ) to replace "隻" (zhī) is originally a popular habit, and it is appropriate in most cases; however, "许多船只通过苏伊士运河" (xǔduō chuánzhī tōngguò Sūyīshì Yùnhé, many ships passed through the Suez Canal) may be understood as "许多船仅仅通过苏伊士运河" (xǔduō chuán jǐnjǐn tōngguò Sūyīshì Yùnhé, many ships only passed through the Suez Canal). There are also some characters that have been misused because they were not clearly explained in the scheme. For example, it is appropriate to simplify "徵收" (zhēngshōu, levy) and "乾净" (gānjìng, clean) into "征收" (zhēngshōu) and "干净" (gānjìng), but it is naturally wrong to write "宫商角徵羽" (gōng shāng jiǎo zhēng yǔ, the five notes of the Chinese pentatonic scale) and "乾隆" (Qiánlóng, the Qianlong Emperor) as "宫商角征羽" (gōng shāng jiǎo zhēng yǔ) and "干隆" (gānlóng).

The resolution of the State Council on the promulgation of the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme stipulates that, in addition to the 230 characters in the first table that are officially promoted, the second and third tables of the scheme are still soliciting opinions and have not been finalized. Even the characters in the first table will be considered for revision if they are indeed inappropriate. The Language Reform Committee is currently soliciting opinions from all parties and is reorganizing and revising the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme based on the experience of the past two years of trial use.

But on the whole, for the sake of the interests of the working people, for the sake of the interests of children and future generations, the work of simplifying Chinese characters must continue to be actively promoted, so that all the more commonly used characters with more complex strokes can be gradually simplified. Most of the characters in the second and third tables have not yet been used. There are still many commonly used characters, such as 赛 (sài), 霸 (bà), 警 (jǐng), 爆 (bào), 整 (zhěng), 翻 (fān), 藏 (cáng), 疆 (jiāng), 徽 (huī), 辩 (biàn), 舞 (wǔ), 感 (gǎn), 影 (yǐng), 鼻 (bí), 鼠 (shǔ), etc., that should be simplified but have not been simplified. In addition, some place name characters, either with many strokes, or unfamiliar and difficult to recognize, or both, such as 衢 (qú), 夔 (kuí), 鄜 (fū), 鄠 (hù), 歙 (shè), 阌 (wén), 亳 (bó), 鄄 (juān), 婺 (wù), 黟 (yī), 酃 (líng), 郴 (chēn), 崞 (guō), 盩厔 (zhōuzhì), etc., must also be simplified, or replaced with familiar characters that are homophonic and have simple strokes. Some of these characters already have popular simplified forms among the masses, which can be considered for adoption; some do not yet have commonly used simplified forms, and their simplified forms can be stipulated on the basis of soliciting opinions from the masses in many ways, and officially promoted after a certain period of trial use, if everyone thinks it is appropriate. In short, the work of simplifying Chinese characters is a major event related to the people of the whole country. On the one hand, it should be cautious and not hasty, but on the other hand, active measures must be taken to continue to promote it in order to achieve greater results. At present, the broad masses of people warmly welcome the simplification of Chinese characters, but the number of simplified characters is not large, which cannot meet their urgent needs—this is the main reason for some divergent phenomena in the use of simplified characters by the masses. In order to prevent the abuse of simplified characters and eliminate the differences in fonts, passive methods will not work. An active attitude must be adopted in the work of simplifying Chinese characters. Simplified characters are always created by the people, and so are traditional characters. Because of this, the text has always been continuously developed and changed through the use of the broad masses. The question is how to concentrate the wisdom of the masses, adjust and reorganize it, and incorporate it into unified norms for easy application—this is the work we should strive to do well now.

Let's talk about promoting Mandarin Chinese.

Nearly 600 million people in our country speak Chinese, speaking various dialects, and there are many sub-dialects within each dialect. The largest population uses Northern dialects, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total population using Chinese. This shows that, on the one hand, there are serious dialectal differences in Chinese, mainly phonetic differences, but on the other hand, there are also favorable objective conditions for gradual unification. The basis for the further unification of Chinese is Mandarin Chinese, which takes Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation and Northern dialects as the basic dialect.

Mandarin Chinese is the common language of the Han nationality, and it can also be said to be the common language of all ethnic groups in our country. Today, our country has achieved unprecedented unity in politics, economy, and culture. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of the whole country are united to strive for the common goal of building socialism. The people urgently need a common language. Without this common language, it will bring certain difficulties to the political, economic, and cultural life of our people. Therefore, vigorously promoting Mandarin Chinese among the people of the whole country is an important political task.

Since the National Language Reform Conference in 1955, the work of promoting Mandarin Chinese has achieved certain results. In addition to the Central Mandarin Chinese Promotion Work Committee, promotion agencies have also been established in 22 provinces and cities. By the end of 1957, 721,600 primary and secondary school teachers and normal school teachers across the country had received training in Mandarin Chinese pronunciation. Several million people have learned Mandarin Chinese and phonetic alphabets from the radio. Since the autumn of 1956, Mandarin Chinese has been taught in the first grade of primary schools across the country, and students in middle schools and normal schools have also learned Mandarin Chinese in Chinese classes. Judging from the results of teaching in many dialect areas, the achievements are huge and the difficulties are completely surmountable. In order to facilitate teaching, most provinces and cities across the country have conducted preliminary surveys of dialects, and many manuals to help people in dialect areas learn Mandarin Chinese based on the results of the surveys have been published. The Mandarin Chinese teaching materials and reading materials compiled by the Ministry of Education, the Language Reform Committee, and various provinces and cities have sold approximately 5 million copies. More than 1 million records for teaching Mandarin Chinese have been sold. The Mandarin Chinese Phonetics Research Class jointly organized by the Ministry of Education and the Academy of Sciences has trained more than 550 core members for the promotion of Mandarin Chinese in various provinces and cities.

The experience of the past two years has proven that as long as the leadership attaches importance to it and works conscientiously, the work of promoting Mandarin Chinese can achieve remarkable results even in areas where the differences between dialects and Mandarin Chinese are large, such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Fujian, and Guangdong.

Promoting Mandarin Chinese is not to eliminate dialects. Dialects will exist for a long time and cannot be eliminated by artificial methods. Dialects are also a useful tool for communication, serving the people of a specific area, but they have regional limitations. Beyond this limit, they lose their function as a communication tool and become an obstacle to mutual understanding. Promoting Mandarin Chinese is not to prohibit dialects, but to enable people who speak dialects to learn a common national language in addition to their native language, so as to communicate with people from various regions. We should vigorously promote Mandarin Chinese in schools at all levels, especially in primary schools, middle schools, and normal schools. We should vigorously promote the learning of Mandarin Chinese among cadres, especially local cadres and young cadres at the district level and above. On the other hand, since dialects still play an important role in local activities, external cadres should also actively learn local dialects in order to closely connect with the masses and do a good job.

Promoting Mandarin Chinese should not and will not harm the right of all fraternal nationalities to use and develop their own languages, which is guaranteed by our country's constitution. Mandarin Chinese should naturally be promoted mainly among the Han people. However, at present, many people of all fraternal nationalities are asking to learn Chinese, and it can be predicted that after the promulgation and implementation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, more people will learn Chinese with the help of the phonetic alphabet. Therefore, it is possible and should be advocated to learn Mandarin Chinese among the fraternal nationalities, and the requirements of those who voluntarily learn should be met as much as possible. This is conducive to mutual unity and mutual learning among the people of all ethnic groups and is in line with the common interests of all ethnic groups in our country. On the other hand, Han cadres working in ethnic minority areas should not only respect the right of ethnic minorities to use and develop their own languages, but must also strive to learn the languages of ethnic minorities.

Promoting Mandarin Chinese is a long-term mass work, and the requirements should not be too high or too urgent. Promoting Mandarin Chinese with Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation does not require everyone to speak Beijing pronunciation like Beijingers. Such a requirement is unreasonable and unnecessary. Beijing pronunciation is a standard, which is the direction of everyone's efforts, but in specific work, there should be different requirements for different objects. The requirements for broadcasters, drama and film actors should be stricter; the requirements for Chinese teachers in normal, middle, and primary schools should be stricter than for ordinary people; the requirements for ordinary people should be broader. The requirements for children and young people should be different from the requirements for middle-aged people. Any effort made by anyone to make their speech closer to Mandarin Chinese should be acknowledged and respected by everyone, because he is earnestly carrying out a serious work. The Mandarin Chinese Promotion Work Committees and education departments in various places should regularly hold Mandarin Chinese speech contests or evaluations, and give certain rewards to those who learn and teach Mandarin Chinese well. Only in this way can we eliminate concerns, improve everyone's confidence and interest in learning Mandarin Chinese, and launch a mass movement to promote Mandarin Chinese. At present, there are still some trends in society that are not conducive to the promotion of Mandarin Chinese. For example, people who learn to speak Mandarin Chinese sometimes receive ridicule instead of encouragement. When children return home and speak Mandarin Chinese, they are reprimanded by some parents, who think they are "imitating Beijing accents" and "forgetting their roots." These facts show that our propaganda work is very poor, and there are still many people in society who do not understand the significance and role of promoting Mandarin Chinese. In order to change this social atmosphere and create favorable conditions for the promotion of Mandarin Chinese, we hope that all deputies can vigorously carry out propaganda work to all aspects of society.

In order to effectively teach Mandarin Chinese, there must also be a set of universally used phonetic alphabets. In the past, the lack of a definite Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has brought certain difficulties to the work of promoting Mandarin Chinese. Now that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is about to be finalized, and this set of phonetic alphabets, because it uses phonetic Latin alphabets, is convenient for people in dialect areas to compare their own pronunciations to learn Mandarin Chinese, it will greatly benefit the promotion of Mandarin Chinese in the future.

Now let's talk about formulating and promoting the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme.

First of all, it should be explained that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is not a Chinese phonetic writing system. The main purpose of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is to provide phonetic notation for Chinese characters and to spell Mandarin Chinese, so as to help literacy, unify pronunciation, and teach Mandarin Chinese. The purpose is to facilitate the learning and use of Chinese characters by the broad masses of people, and to promote the further unification of the Chinese language. It is not intended to replace Chinese characters. As for the future of Chinese characters: will it remain unchanged forever or will it change? Will it change within the inherent form of Chinese characters, or will it be replaced by a phonetic writing system? Will it be replaced by a Latin alphabet-based phonetic writing system, or by another form of phonetic writing system? We don't have to rush to conclusions on these questions now. We believe that Chinese characters will always change, as can be proven by the past changes of Chinese characters, and will always move in the common phonetic direction of the world in the future. Moreover, it can be said that the languages and writings of all ethnic groups in the world will gradually converge and unify one day in the future. However, these are not within the scope of the current language reform tasks, so we don't have to discuss them today.

We will give a more detailed explanation below regarding the drafting process and the uses of the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme.

II. The Drafting Process and Uses of the Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme

In October 1949, the Chinese Language Reform Association was established in Beijing and began work on formulating a Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. In February 1952, the Chinese Language Reform Research Committee was established. Its main work, in addition to simplifying Chinese characters, was to study phonetic alphabet schemes. From February 1952 to the end of 1954, for nearly three years, it mainly carried out the research and drafting of national forms, that is, Chinese character stroke-style phonetic alphabet schemes. In December 1954, after the Chinese Language Reform Research Committee was reorganized into the Chinese Language Reform Committee, a Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Committee was established within the committee to conduct a more comprehensive and systematic study of the phonetic alphabet scheme. By October 1955, four Chinese character stroke-style and two internationally used alphabet-style (one Latin alphabet-style and the other Russian alphabet-style) phonetic alphabet scheme drafts had been prepared and distributed to the representatives attending the National Language Reform Conference held in Beijing at that time for comments. After the National Language Reform Conference, based on several years of comparative research, mass opinions, and leadership instructions, it was decided to adopt the Latin alphabet. In February 1956, the first draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme was published to widely solicit opinions. In addition to the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference holding enlarged meetings for discussion, discussions were organized in the political consultative conferences of 22 provinces, 3 cities, 2 autonomous regions, 26 provincial-level cities, 4 counties, and 1 autonomous prefecture, with more than 10,000 participants. Departments closely related to the phonetic alphabet, such as postal and telecommunications, navy, railways, and education for the blind, also conducted special discussions on the draft on different scales. In addition, from February to September 1956, we also received more than 4,300 written comments on the draft from people from all walks of life across the country and overseas Chinese.

Based on the above-mentioned opinions, we put forward our opinions on revising this draft in August 1956 and sent them to the State Council for review. In October, the State Council established the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Review Committee to conduct the review. By October 1957, the Review Committee had held five meetings, many symposiums, and had invited 178 representatives from all circles of language, education, literature, art, news, publishing, science and technology, and translation in Beijing, as well as representatives from the army and people's organizations to hold symposiums. At the same time, written opinions were solicited from 100 language workers in 39 cities outside Beijing. After repeated discussions, consultations, and revisions, the Review Committee submitted the revised draft in October 1957. After discussion at an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the 60th plenary session of the State Council adopted it as the "Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" on November 1, and decided to submit it to the National People's Congress for discussion and approval.

Here, we must point out that in the entire process of drafting the scheme, we also received assistance from more than 1,000 comrades who were enthusiastic about the phonetic alphabet. From the period of the Language Reform Association in 1949 to October 1957, we received a total of more than 1,200 Chinese phonetic alphabet schemes of various types from people across the country and overseas Chinese. Although most of them, as complete schemes, cannot be said to be mature, some of the designs and suggestions gave us a lot of inspiration and help. The completion of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is inseparable from the assistance of these more than 1,000 comrades.

The above is the drafting process of the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. Facts have proven that this draft has been studied by experts for a long time, discussed repeatedly by all parties, and revised many times. It truly reflects the opinions of the majority of people who participated in the discussions. It should be said that the government's attitude towards this work is serious and responsible, and the steps taken are also cautious. Right-wing element Zhang Bojun said that this was done behind closed doors by a few people and "only discussed by a few enthusiasts," which is naturally a slander with ulterior motives.

From the perspective of the historical development of Chinese character phonetic notation in our country, this draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme inherits the traditions of "direct pronunciation," "fanqie," and phonetic alphabets in our country, and is developed on their basis. Chinese characters belong to the ideographic writing system. The pronunciation cannot be seen from the shape of the characters, so the question of how to provide phonetic notation for Chinese characters arises. There have always been two main methods, one is "direct pronunciation" and the other is "fanqie." Direct pronunciation is to use homophones to provide phonetic notation; the difficulty of this method is, as Chen Li of the Qing Dynasty said, "If there is no homophone, then the method is exhausted; even if there is a homophone, but it is obscure and difficult to recognize, then the method is also exhausted." Fanqie was invented at the end of the Han Dynasty, which is to use two characters to spell a sound: the upper character takes the initial consonant, and the lower character takes the final vowel. The advantage of fanqie is that any sound of a character can be spelled out, and its disadvantage is that spelling it is inconvenient, and it is not easy for ordinary people to understand; and like the direct pronunciation method, one must first recognize many characters. After the Revolution of 1911, phonetic alphabets were produced, and any Beijing pronunciation could be spelled out as long as thirty-seven letters were recognized. This is naturally a great progress. However, compared with the Latin alphabet, the phonetic alphabets have their irretrievable shortcomings. First of all, it has few other uses besides phonetic notation, so it is difficult to promote. The Latin alphabet is widely used in science and technology, has many uses, has many opportunities to come into contact with, and is not easy to forget. When adopting phonetic alphabets, general middle school students still have to learn the Latin alphabet; when adopting the Latin alphabet, there is no need to learn the phonetic alphabets. Secondly, some vowels in the phonetic alphabets are not phonetic letters, so they are not as flexible as the Latin alphabet for use as the basis for creating writing systems for ethnic minorities and for transliterating foreign words. The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme uses the Latin alphabet, which is another step forward than the phonetic alphabets.

From the aspect of adopting the Latin alphabet, the historical origin of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme can be traced back to more than 350 years ago. As early as the 33rd year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty, that is, 1605, the first scheme for spelling Chinese with the Latin alphabet was produced. Since then, various Latin alphabet-style Chinese phonetic alphabet schemes have appeared successively. After the end of the 19th century, patriotic intellectuals at that time rose up to advocate language reform and create phonetic alphabet schemes. Among them, Lu Genzhang, Zhu Wenxiong, Liu Mengyang, Huang Xubai, Xing Dao, and Liu Jishan and others drafted Latin alphabet-style phonetic alphabet schemes. By 1926, the "National Romanization" prepared by Qian Xuantong, Li Jinxi, Zhao Yuanren, etc. was produced, which was officially promulgated by the then Nanjing University in 1928. Then, in 1931, the "Latinization New Writing" prepared by Qu Qiubai, Wu Yuzhang, etc. was produced. Latinization New Writing and National Romanization are two relatively complete schemes in the Latin alphabet-style Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, which greatly surpassed the various schemes before them. The current Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme absorbs the advantages of various past Latin alphabet-style phonetic alphabet schemes and is developed on their basis. It can be said that it is the crystallization of the phonetic alphabet movement for more than 300 years, and also the summary of the experience of the Chinese people in creating phonetic alphabet schemes for 60 years.

Can we say that our patriotism is not enough when we adopt the Latin alphabet? We cannot say that. The Latin alphabet is an alphabet commonly used by more than 60 countries in the world today, and it is a set of common symbols that people of any ethnicity in the world who have received secondary education must learn in algebra, geometry, chemistry, and physics classes. Like Arabic numerals, the Gregorian calendar, the metric system, and the staff, it is not something exclusively owned by one country, but a public property shared by all mankind. Just as the erhu (which, like the Latin alphabet, is not inherent to the Han nationality) can adapt to the needs of our nation and become our national musical instrument, the Latin alphabet can also adapt to the needs of Chinese and become our national alphabet—not only can it, but it has already done so in our scheme. What is spelled out with this set of Chinese phonetic alphabets is genuine Chinese—Mandarin Chinese with Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation. It will not damage the purity of our national language in the slightest, so it will not conflict with legitimate patriotic feelings in any way. This is a very clear truth.

Secondly, let's talk about the uses of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme.

The first is to use it to provide phonetic notation for Chinese characters in order to improve the efficiency of teaching Chinese characters. First of all, it can be used to provide phonetic notation for primary school language textbooks and literacy textbooks in Northern dialect areas. In addition, it can also be used to provide phonetic notation for children's books, comic strips, and popular newspapers and periodicals. In this way, children and illiterate people who are learning to read can rely on phonetic alphabets to read books and newspapers, and further recognize more Chinese characters. Dictionaries and encyclopedias should naturally also use phonetic alphabets for phonetic notation. In general newspapers and books, it can be used to provide phonetic notation for obscure characters and characters that are easily mispronounced.

The second is to use it to help teach Mandarin Chinese. Teaching Mandarin Chinese by relying solely on oral transmission is easy to forget. There must be a set of phonetic alphabets to compile and print Mandarin Chinese teaching materials, reading materials, character lists, and dictionaries for learners to refer to and correct their pronunciation at any time in order to achieve results. Phonetic alphabets are an indispensable tool for teaching Mandarin Chinese, which has been fully proven in language teaching.

The third is to use it as a common basis for the creation of writing systems for ethnic minorities in our country. Many ethnic minority groups in our country do not yet have their own national writing systems. Some, although they already have writing systems, still have shortcomings and need to be reformed. If ethnic minority groups create and reform writing systems and each develops their own set of alphabets, the supply of equipment such as typing, typesetting, and telegraph equipment will have certain difficulties, which will have an adverse effect on the development of culture and education of various ethnic groups. After the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is officially finalized, it can be used as a common basis for creating writing systems under the voluntary conditions of various ethnic minorities. In this way, it will be very convenient for the languages of various ethnic groups to absorb Chinese vocabulary to develop and enrich their own languages and for mutual learning and communication among the people of all ethnic groups in our country.

Fourth, it can be used to solve the problem of translating personal names, place names, and scientific terms. Because we do not yet have a state-prescribed Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, the transliteration of Chinese personal names and place names in foreign documents and publications still uses the Wade-Giles system and other spellings, which are neither correct nor reasonable. After the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is finalized, this problem can be solved. On the other hand, the problem of translating foreign personal names, place names, and scientific and technical terms may also be gradually solved reasonably by using phonetic alphabets.

Fifth, it can help foreigners learn Chinese in order to promote international cultural exchange. Since liberation, as China's international status has increased day by day, more and more people in various countries around the world are willing to learn Chinese. We can use phonetic alphabets to compile and print various Chinese textbooks, reading materials, and dictionaries to help them learn Chinese. After they have mastered Chinese, phonetic alphabets can also help them further learn Chinese characters and Chinese texts.

Sixth, it can solve the problem of compiling indexes. Chinese characters do not have a strict order of arrangement, so it is very time-consuming to compile a list, look up a character in a dictionary, or find a number in a telephone directory. The 26 Latin alphabets have a fixed order of arrangement. Arranging indexes, compiling dictionaries, compiling bibliographies, compiling cards, and arranging archives, materials, medical records, etc., according to the order of the Latin alphabet is simple, rigorous, and convenient to check. The character retrieval method can be said to be used by every organ, group, school, factory, and even everyone. Adopting the order of this set of phonetic alphabets can improve work efficiency, and the benefits are obvious.

Seventh, language workers can use the phonetic alphabet scheme to continue to carry out various research and experimental work related to the phoneticization of Chinese characters.

In addition to the above-mentioned more significant uses, phonetic alphabets can also be used in the future to solve problems such as telegraphs, flag signals, and code names for industrial products. The so-called "four-code telegraph" currently used in our country requires two translation procedures for sending and receiving, which is prone to errors, and is also inconvenient to use on telex machines. Flag signals cannot use Chinese characters at all. With the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, after a certain period of research and experimentation, the problem of using phonetic alphabets for telegraphs and flag signals may be solved. There are many types of industrial products, and there are various specifications of the same type of product, which need to be coded with letters and numbers. In the past, because there were no official phonetic alphabets, the code names used phonetic alphabets, Russian alphabets, or English alphabets, which was quite chaotic. After we have the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, these problems will be easily solved.

According to the above, it can be seen that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has a long history in our country and is urgently required by the broad masses of people today. Whether it is literacy education, the promotion of Mandarin Chinese, or the creation of writing systems for ethnic minorities, they are all eagerly awaiting the early finalization of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. This scheme has been studied by experts for a long time, discussed extensively by people from all walks of life across the country, and reviewed and revised for a year. It is indeed more appropriate than various past schemes, and further improvement can be sought in future practice. For this reason, we hope that the Congress will approve this scheme after discussion.

After this scheme is approved by the Congress, we hope that it will be gradually promoted nationwide. First of all, it should be used to provide phonetic notation for this autumn's primary school language textbooks and literacy textbooks in Northern dialect areas, so as to reduce the difficulties for thousands of children and illiterate people in literacy. We hope that all levels of organs and groups will vigorously advocate the use of phonetic alphabets to learn Mandarin Chinese among general cadres, and set an example for the promotion of Mandarin Chinese in society. Phonetic alphabets are easy to teach and easy to learn. It usually only takes 20 to 30 hours to learn. People who speak Mandarin Chinese or have phonetic knowledge will learn it faster. If we vigorously promote it, it is entirely possible to have all students and most young people across the country learn phonetic alphabets during the Second Five-Year Plan period. This will play a huge role in promoting literacy, eliminating illiteracy, unifying pronunciation, and promoting Mandarin Chinese, and will be of great benefit to improving the cultural level of the people of our country and promoting the cause of socialist construction. We hope that people from all walks of life will actively promote and advocate it together!

Notes

[Direct Pronunciation] Direct pronunciation and fanqie are both ancient methods of providing phonetic notation for Chinese characters in our country, and are still used in some dictionaries. If character A and character B have the same pronunciation, character A is used to provide phonetic notation for character B, which is called direct pronunciation, for example, "宫, 音弓" (gōng, pronounced as gōng). This method often encounters difficulties: some characters, such as 丢 (diū), 嫩 (nèn), 耍 (shuǎ), do not have homophones that can be used for phonetic notation; the homophones of some characters are obscure and difficult to recognize, and using them for phonetic notation is the same as not using them, for example, "宣, 音瑄" (xuān, pronounced as xuān).

[Fanqie] Fanqie is to use two characters to spell out the sound of one character, for example, "高, 古牢切" (gāo, spelled with gǔ and láo). The "古" (gǔ) character is the upper character of fanqie, and the "牢" (láo) character is the lower character of fanqie. The sound required can be spelled out by reading the upper and lower characters quickly in succession. Its principle is like this: the pronunciation of the character "古" (gǔ) is gu, g is the initial consonant, and u is the final vowel; the pronunciation of the character "牢" (láo) is lao, l is the initial consonant, and ao is the final vowel; when

    关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告
    一九五八年二月三日在第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议上
    中国文字改革委员会主任　吴玉章各位代表：
    汉语拼音方案草案，经过两年来全国各方面的讨论，经过国务院设立的汉语拼音方案审订委员会的反复审议和修订，一九五七年十月间又经政协全国委员会常务委员会扩大会议的讨论，于一九五七年十一月一日由国务院全体会议第六十次会议通过，现在提请全国人民代表大会讨论和批准。我现在代表中国文字改革委员会就当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案问题向大会作报告，请大会审议。
    一、当前文字改革的任务和几年来的文字改革工作
    当前我国文字改革的任务，在汉民族说来，就是：（1）简化汉字，使它更容易为广大人民掌握和使用，以便在广大人民中更多、更好、更快、更省地扫除文盲，普及和提高文化；（2）推广普通话，以消除方言的隔阂，促进汉语的进一步统一，使我们的语言能够更好地为我国的社会主义建设服务；（3）制定和推行汉语拼音方案，为汉字注音和帮助推广普通话。
    这几年来的文字改革工作，就是遵照上述的方针进行的。
    先说汉字简化工作。
    全国解放以后，政府就开始了汉字简化的研究工作。一九五二年中国文字改革研究委员会成立以后，开始草拟汉字简化方案。一九五五年一月，中国文字改革委员会发表“汉字简化方案草案”，广泛征求意见。全国各地各界人士参加讨论的在二十万人以上。草案在根据这些意见作了初步修正，并经国务院设立的汉字简化方案审订委员会审订以后，于一九五五年十月提交全国文字改革会议讨论通过。一九五六年一月，国务院公布“汉字简化方案”。这个方案包括三个部分：第一部分即汉字简化第一表，包含二百三十个简化汉字（即把二百四十五个繁体字简化成二百三十个简体字；其中有两个或三个繁体字合并成一个简体字的，所以简化后的字数比简化前少十五字），从方案公布的时候起即已通用；第二部分即汉字简化第二表，包含二百八十五个简化汉字（即把二百九十九个繁体字简化成二百八十五个简体字，由于合并，比简化前少十四字），其中的九十五个字从一九五六年六月起开始试用；第三部分即汉字偏旁简化表，包含五十四个简化偏旁，已有三十个根据这个表类推出来的字从方案公布的时候起开始试用。三项合计，现在各报刊使用的简化汉字，共计三百五十五个。此外，还有属于汉字简化第二表的一百九十个简化汉字和属于第三表的绝大部分简化偏旁类推字还没有使用。但是在少数出版物上使用的简化汉字，也有超过三百五十五字的范围的，例如在小学语文课本和扫盲教材中，汉字简化方案的三个表差不多已经全部使用。
    汉字远自甲骨文时代就已经有简体，以后各个时代简体字都有发展。我们的工作只是比较系统地来进行简化，并且使简体成为正体。采用简化汉字的利益是十分显著的。汉字简化方案第一表和第二表所简化的繁体字五百四十四个，笔画总数是八千七百四十五画，平均每字十六点零八画；简化之后归并成五百一十五个简化汉字，笔画总数是四千二百零六画，平均每字只有八点一六画。就是说，写简化汉字比写繁体字可以省力一半。在这两个表里，十画以下的字在简化前只有三十四个，简化后增加到四百零九个，十一画的字在简化前和简化后都是三十五个，十二画以上的字，简化前有四百七十五个，简化后减少到七十一个。如果把第一表和第二表中的五百一十五个简化汉字，依照第三表偏旁简化办法继续加以简化，那末每个简化汉字的平均笔画估计可以进一步减少到六点五画，只占原来繁体字平均笔画的百分之四十强。简化汉字的推行，无论在儿童教育、扫除文盲和一般人的书写方面都有很大的利益，因此受到广大群众特别是少年儿童的热烈欢迎。
    一些右派分子利用共产党整风的机会，对文字改革进行了恶毒的攻击，说汉字简化搞糟了，要国务院撤回汉字简化方案。简化汉字是符合广大人民利益的好事，反人民的右派分子自然要反对，把它说成坏事。我们从广大人民利益的立场出发，应该肯定：汉字简化确实为亿万儿童和文盲办了一件好事，是搞好了而不是搞糟了。
    但是在另一方面，必须指出，汉字简化工作中确实还有一些缺点。好些同志向我们提出了合理的建议，希望我们考虑。对于这些提意见的热心人士，我们是很感谢的。两年来的事实证明：汉字简化方案中的确有少数汉字的简化办法，特别在同音代替方面，考虑得不够周到，因此在使用上还不够妥善，或者可能发生误解。比方以“只”代“隻”，这本来是早已流行的习惯，在绝大多数场合是恰当的；但是“许多船只通过苏伊士运河”，就有可能被理解为“许多船仅仅通过苏伊士运河”。还有一些字，由于在方案中没有交代清楚，因而被人误用。例如，“徵收”“乾净”简化成为“征收”“干净”是适当的，但是把“宫商角徵羽”“乾隆”写成“宫商角征羽”“干隆”，自然就是错误的了。
    国务院公布汉字简化方案的决议中规定：除了第一表的二百三十个字作为正式推行以外，方案的第二表、第三表还在征求意见，还没有最后确定。就是第一表中的字，如果确实有不适当的，我们也准备考虑修改。现在文字改革委员会正在向各方面征求意见，并根据两年来试用的经验，对汉字简化方案进行整理修订。
    但是从整个来说，为劳动人民的利益着想，为儿童和后代子孙的利益着想，汉字简化工作必须继续积极推进，使所有比较常用的、笔画较繁的字都能逐步得到简化。现在第二表和第三表中的大部分字还没有使用。还有很多比较常用的字，例如赛、霸、警、爆、整、翻、藏、疆、徽、辩、舞、感、影、鼻、鼠等等，应该简化，但是没有简化。此外，还有一部分地名用字，或者笔画较多，或者生僻难认，或者二者兼而有之，如衢、夔、鄜、鄠、歙、阌、亳、鄄、婺、黟、酃、郴、崞、盩厔等等，也必须加以简化，或者用同音而笔画简单的熟字代替。这些字中有些在群众中已有流行的简体，可以考虑采纳；有些还没有通行的简体，也可以在多方征求群众意见的基础上规定它们的简体，经过一定时期的试用，大家认为适当，然后正式推行。总之，汉字简化工作是关系全国人民的大事，一方面应该慎重，不可草率，但是另一方面又必须采取积极的措施，继续推进，才能收到更大的成效。目前广大群众对于简化汉字是热烈欢迎的，但是简化的字数不多，不能满足他们的迫切要求——这是目前群众使用简字方面产生一些纷歧现象的主要原因。为了防止滥用简字以及消除字体的纷歧，决不是消极的办法所能奏效，必须在汉字简化工作上采取积极的态度。简字总是由人民群众创造的，就是繁体字也是人民群众创造的。正因为这样，所以历来文字通过广大群众的使用，总是不断发展和变化的。问题在于如何集中群众的智慧，加以调整整理，纳入统一的规范，以便于应用——这就是我们现在应该努力做好的工作。
    再说推广普通话。
    我国说汉语的人民将近六亿，说着各种不同的方言，每个方言内部还有许多小方言。使用北方话的人口最多，约占使用汉语的全部人口百分之七十以上。这就说明了：汉语中一方面存在着严重的方言纷歧，最主要的是语音上的纷歧，但是另一方面也存在着逐步统一的有利客观条件。汉语进一步统一的基础就是以北京语音为标准音、以北方话为基础方言的普通话。
    普通话是汉民族的共同语言，而且可以说，也是我国各族人民的共同语言。今天我们的国家，在政治、经济、文化上实现了历史上空前的团结和统一，全国人民在党和政府领导之下团结一致，为建设社会主义这个共同目标而奋斗，人民群众迫切需要一种共同的语言。如果没有这种共同语言，就会给我国人民的政治、经济、文化生活带来一定的困难。因此在全国人民中大力推广普通话，就是一项重要的政治任务。
    自从1955年全国文字改革会议以来，推广普通话的工作已经收到一定的成效。除了中央推广普通话工作委员会之外，在二十二个省市也已经设立了推广的机构。到1957年年底为止，全国受过普通话语音训练的中小学和师范学校教师已有七十二  万一千六百人。从广播中学习过普通话和拼音字母的人已经有好几百万。从1956年秋季起，全国小学一年级开始教学普通话，中学和师范学校学生也在汉语课中学习了普通话。从许多方言区教学的结果看来，成绩是巨大的，困难是完全可以克服的。为了便利教学，全国多数省市进行了方言的初步调查工作，根据调查的结果写成的帮助方言区群众学习普通话的手册已经出版多种。教育部、文字改革委员会和各省市编制的普通话教材、读物，销行约达五百多万册。各种教学普通话用的留声片销行一百多万张。教育部和科学院合办的普通话语音研究班，
  已经为各省市培养了五百五十多名推广普通话的骨干。
    两年来的经验证明，只要领导重视，认真工作，尽管在方言和普通话差别较大的地区，像浙江、江苏、上海、福建、广东等地，推广普通话的工作也能收到显著的成效。
    推广普通话并不是消灭方言。方言是会长期存在的，它不能用人为的方法来消灭。方言也是一种有用的交际工具，它是为某一特定地区的人民服务的，但是它有地区的局限性，超过这个限度就丧失交际工具的作用，成为互相了解的障碍。推广普通话并不是禁止方言，而是使说方言的人们在自己的乡音之外，学会说一种全民族共同的语言，以便跟各地区的人互相交际。我们应该在各级学校中，特别是小学、中学和师范学校中，大力推广普通话。应该在干部中，特别是区以上各级地方干部和青年干部中，大力提倡学习普通话。在另一方面，由于方言在地方性活动中仍然起着重要的作用，外来干部还应当积极学习当地的方言，以便密切联系群众，做好工作。
    推广普通话不应当，也不会损害我国宪法赋与的各兄弟民族使用和发展本民族语言的权利。普通话自然主要应该在汉族人民中推广。但是目前各兄弟民族中有许多人要求学习汉语，而且可以预料，在汉语拼音方案公布施行之后，借助于拼音方案学习汉语的人会更见增多。因此，在兄弟民族中可以而且应该提倡学习普通话，并且对自愿学习的人应该尽量满足他们的要求，这是有利于各族人民之间的互相团结和互相学习，符合我国各民族的共同利益的。在另一方面，在兄弟民族地区工作的汉族干部，不但应该尊重兄弟民族使用和发展民族语言的权利，而且必须努力学习兄弟民族的语言。
    推广普通话是一项长期的群众性的工作，要求不能过高过急。推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话，并不是要求大家把北京语音说得像北京人一样，这样的要求是不合理的，也是不必要的。北京语音是个标准，这是大家努力的方向，但是在具体工作中对于不同的对象应有不同的要求。对于广播员、话剧和电影演员要求要严些；对师范、中、小学校语文教员的要求比一般人应该严些；对于一般人的要求应该宽些。对于儿童、青年的要求，应该不同于对中年人的要求。任何一个人，为了把自己的话说得更加接近普通话一些而作的任何努力，应该得到大家的承认和尊敬，因为他在认真进行一件严肃的工作。各地推广普通话工作委员会和教育部门，应该定期举办普通话演说竞赛或评比，对于普通话学得好和教得好的人给以一定的奖励。只有这样，才能消除顾虑，提高大家学习普通话的信心和兴趣，才能掀起一个群众性的推广普通话运动。目前社会上还有一些不利于推广普通话的风气。比方，学说普通话的人有时得到的不是鼓励，而是讥笑。孩子们回到家里说普通话，受到有些家长的斥责，认为是“撇京腔”、“忘本”。这些事实说明我们的宣传工作做得很差，在社会上还有不少人对于推广普通话的意义和作用不够了解。为了转移这种社会风气，为推广普通话造成有利条件，我们希望各位代表能够向各方面人士大力进行宣传工作。
    为了有效地教学普通话，还必须有一套普遍通行的拼音字母。过去由于汉语拼音方案没有确定，这给推广普通话工作带来了一定的困难。现在汉语拼音方案即将确定，而且这套拼音字母，由于采用音素化的拉丁字母，便于方言区的人们对比自己的方音来学习普通话，将大大有利于今后普通话的推广工作。
    现在再说制定和推行汉语拼音方案。
    首先应该说明：汉语拼音方案不是汉语拼音文字。汉语拼音方案的主要用途是给汉字注音和拼写普通话，以帮助识字、统一读音和教学普通话，目的在于便利广大人民的学习和使用汉字，以及促进汉语的进一步统一，并非用来代替汉字。至于汉字的前途问题：它是永远不变还是要变呢？它是在汉字固有的形体范围内变化，还是被拼音文字所代替呢？它是为拉丁字母式的拼音文字所代替，还是为别的形式的拼音文字所代替呢？这些问题我们现在还可以不忙去作结论。我们认为：汉字总是要变的，拿汉字过去的变化就可以证明，将来总是要走世界共同的拼音方向。而且可以说，世界各个民族的语言和文字，将来总有一天会逐渐接近和统一。但是这些都不属于当前文字改革的任务的范围，因此我们今天还不必加以讨论。
    关于汉语拼音方案草案的制订经过和它的用处，我们在下面作较为详细的说明。
    二、汉语拼音方案草案的制订经过和它的用处
    一九四九年十月，中国文字改革协会在北京成立，就开始进行有关制订汉语拼音方案的工作。一九五二年二月，中国文字改革研究委员会成立，它的主要工作，除了简化汉字之外，就是研究拼音方案。从一九五二年二月到一九五四年年底近三个年头的时间内，主要地进行了民族形式即汉字笔画式拼音方案的研究和拟订工作。一九五四年十二月，中国文字改革研究委员会改组成为中国文字改革委员会以后，在会内设立了拼音方案委员会，对拼音方案进行了更全面的系统的研究工作。到一九五五年十月，拟订出了四个汉字笔画式的，两个国际通用字母式的（其中一个是拉丁字母式的，另一个是俄文字母式的）拼音方案草稿，曾经分发给当时在北京举行的全国文字改革会议的代表们，征求意见。全国文字改革会议以后，根据几年来的比较研究、群众的意见和领导上的指示，决定采用拉丁字母。一九五六年二月，发表汉语拼音方案的第一个草案，广泛征求意见。除了政协全国委员会常务委员会召开扩大会议进行讨论以外，各地在政协委员会中组织讨论的有二十二个省、三个市、两个自治区、二十六个省辖市、四个县和一个自治州，参加人数在一万以上。与拼音字母关系比较密切的邮电、海军、铁道、盲人教育等部门还对草案进行了不同规模的专门讨论。另外，从一九五六年二月到九月，我们还收到全国各方面人士及海外华侨对草案的书面意见四千三百多件。
    根据上述各方面的意见，于一九五六年八月我们提出了对这个草案的修正意见，送请国务院审核。十月，国务院设立汉语拼音方案审订委员会进行审议。至一九五七年十月，审订委员会开过五次会议，多次座谈，并且曾经邀请在北京的语言、教育、文艺、新闻、出版、科技、翻译各界以及部队和人民团体的代表一百七十八人举行座谈，同时向京外三十九个城市的一百位语文工作者书面征求意见。经过反复讨论、磋商和修订，审订委员会于一九五七年十月提出修正草案，经政协全国委员会常务委员会的扩大会议讨论，十一月一日由国务院全体会议第六十次会议作为“汉语拼音方案草案”通过，并且决定提交全国人民代表大会讨论和批准。
    在这里，我们必须指出，在拟制方案的整个过程中间，我们还得到了一千多位热心拼音字母的同志的协助。从一九四九年文字改革协会的时期起到一九五七年十月止，我们收到了全国各地人士和海外华侨寄来的各式各样的汉语拼音方案共计一千二百多个。尽管其中的大多数，作为完整的方案，还不能说是成熟的，但是其中的一些设计和建议，给了我们不少的启发和帮助。汉语拼音方案的制订完成，是跟这一千多位同志的协助分不开的。
    以上就是汉语拼音方案草案制订的经过。事实证明：这个草案是经过专家长期研究、各方反复讨论和多次修订的，它确实反映了参加讨论的大多数人的意见。应该说，政府对待这项工作的态度是认真负责的，所采取的步骤也是慎重的。右派分子章伯钧说这是几个人关起门来搞的，“只经少数热心分子讨论”，这自然是别有用心的污蔑。
    从我国汉字注音的历史发展来看，这个汉语拼音方案草案是继承我国“直音”、“反切”、注音字母的传统，是在它们的基础上发展起来的。汉字属于表意文字体系，字形上看不出读音，因而产生怎样给汉字注音的问题。历来有两种主要的办法，一个是“直音”，一个是“反切”。直音就是用同音字来注音；这个办法的困难，正如清朝陈澧所说：“或无同音之字则其法穷，虽有同音之字而隐僻难识，则其法又穷。”汉末发明了反切，就是用两个字来拼一个音：上字取声，下字取韵。反切的好处是无论什么字音都拼切得出来，它的缺点是拼切起来不方便，一般人不易领会；而且跟直音法一样，都必须先识不少字才行。辛亥革命之后产生了注音字母，只要认识三十七个字母就可以拼出任何北京语音来。这自然是一个很大的进步。但是比起拉丁字母来，注音字母有它难以补救的缺点。首先它除了注音以外，很少其他用处，因此难以推广。拉丁字母在科学技术上普遍使用，用处多，接触机会多，学了不容易忘记。采用注音字母，一般中学生仍旧要学拉丁字母；采用拉丁字母，却不必再学注音字母。其次，注音字母中一部分韵母不是音素字母，因此对于用作少数民族创造文字的基础，对于音译外来语，也不如拉丁字母灵活。汉语拼音方案采用拉丁字母，就比注音字母又前进了一步。
    从采用拉丁字母这个方面来看，汉语拼音方案的历史渊源，可以追溯到三百五十多年以前。远在明朝万历三十三年，即一六零五年，就产生了第一个用拉丁字母拼写汉语的方案。自此以后，曾经陆续出现过各种各样的拉丁字母式的汉语拼音方案。十九世纪末叶以后，当时爱国的知识分子，群起提倡文字改革，创制拼音方案。其中拟订过拉丁字母式拼音方案的有卢戆章、朱文熊、刘孟扬、黄虚白、邢岛、刘继善等人。至一九二六年，产生了由钱玄同、黎锦熙、赵元任等制订的“国语罗马字”，曾由当时南京的大学院于一九二八年正式公布。接着，一九三一年产生了由瞿秋白、吴玉章等制订的“拉丁化新文字”。拉丁化新文字和国语罗马字是拉丁字母式汉语拼音方案中比较完善的两个方案，大大超越了它们之前的各种方案。现在这个汉语拼音方案吸取了以往各种拉丁字母式拼音方案的优点，是在它们的基础上发展下来的。可以说它是三百多年来拼音字母运动的结晶，也是六十年来中国人民创造拼音方案的经验总结。
    我们采用拉丁字母，是不是可以说我们的爱国心不够呢？不能这样说。拉丁字母是现在世界上六十多个国家共同使用的字母，而且是全世界任何一个民族中受中等教育的人在代数、几何、化学、物理课上所必须学会的一套共同符号。像阿拉伯数字、公历纪元、公制度量衡、五线谱一样，它不是某一个国家专有的东西，而是全人类共有的公物。正如胡琴（它跟拉丁字母一样，不是汉民族固有的）能够适应我们的民族的需要而成为我们的民族乐器一样，拉丁字母也能够适应汉语的需要而成为我们的民族字母，——不仅是能够，而且在我们的方案中已经这样做到了。用这套汉语拼音字母拼写出来的正是地道的汉语——以北京语音为标准音的普通话。它丝毫不会损害我们民族语言的纯洁，因此也就不会跟正当的爱国感情有任何抵触，这是十分明白的道理。
    其次，说一说汉语拼音方案的用处。
    第一是用来给汉字注音，以提高教学汉字的效率。首先可以用来在小学语文课本和北方话区的扫盲课本上注音。此外，如儿童读物、连环图画、通俗报刊也可以用来注音。这样，初学文字的儿童和文盲，就可以依靠拼音字母来阅读书报，并且进一步认识更多汉字。字典和辞典自然也应该用拼音字母注音。一般报刊书籍上，可以用来给冷僻的字和容易读错的字注音。
    第二是用来帮助教学普通话。教学普通话光凭口耳传授，学了容易忘记，必须有一套拼音字母，编印普通话的教材、读物、字表和辞典，供学习的人随时参考，校正发音，才能收到成效。拼音字母是教学普通话所不可缺少的工具，这是在语言教学中已经得到充分证明的。
    第三是用来作为我国少数民族创造文字的共同基础。我国许多兄弟民族，至今还没有自己的民族文字，有些虽然已有文字，但是还有缺点，需要改革。兄弟民族创造和改革文字，如果各搞一套字母，打字、排字、电报等设备的供应会发生一定的困难，对于各民族文化教育的发展将发生不利的影响。汉语拼音方案正式确定之后，就可以在各少数民族自愿的条件下，用来作为创造文字的共同基础。这样，各民族文字吸收汉语词汇来发展和丰富自己的语言以及我国各族人民之间的互相学习和交际，都将得到很大的方便。
    第四，可以用来解决人名、地名和科学术语的翻译问题。由于我们还没有一个国家规定的汉语拼音方案，中国人名、地名的音译，在对外文件和书刊中至今沿用威妥玛式等拼法，既不正确，也不合理。汉语拼音方案确定之后，这个问题就可以得到解决。另一方面，翻译外国人名、地名和科学技术术语的问题，也有可能利用拼音字母逐渐求得一个合理的解决。
    第五，可以帮助外国人学习汉语，以促进国际文化交流。解放以来，由于我国的国际地位日益提高，世界各国愿意学习汉语的人是越来越多了。我们可以用拼音字母来编印各种汉语课本、读物和辞典，帮助他们学习汉语。等他们掌握了汉语之后，拼音字母还可以帮助他们进一步学习汉字汉文。
    第六，可以解决编索引的问题。汉字没有严密的排列顺序，因此不论是排一个名单，在字典里查一个字，或者在电话簿里找一个号码都是很费时间的事情。二十六个拉丁字母有固定的排列顺序，按照拉丁字母的顺序来编索引，编字典，编书目，编卡片以及排列档案、资料、病历等等，既简便，又严密，检查起来很方便。检字法可以说是每个机关、团体、学校、工厂，甚至是每个人都要用的，采用这套拼音字母的顺序，可以提高工作效率，好处是很显然的。
    第七，语文工作者可以用拼音方案来继续进行有关汉字拼音化的各项研究和实验工作。
    除了上述各项比较显著的用处以外，拼音字母在将来还可以用来解决电报、旗语以及工业产品的代号等问题。目前我国使用的所谓“四码电报”，要经过收发两道翻译手续，容易出错，而且在电传打字机上使用也不便利。旗语更无法使用汉字。有了汉语拼音方案，经过一定时期的研究和试验，电报和旗语利用拼音字母的问题都可能得到解决。工业产品种类多，同类产品又有各种不同规格，需要用字母加数码作为代号。过去因为没有正式的拼音字母，代号有用注音字母的，有用俄文字母的，也有用英文字母的，相当混乱。我们有了汉语拼音方案之后，这类问题就容易解决了。
    根据以上所说，可以看出：汉语拼音方案在我国是有长远的历史渊源的，是今天广大人民所迫切要求的。无论识字教育、普通话推广工作以及少数民族文字的创造，都在迫切地等待汉语拼音方案及早确定。这个方案经过专家们的长期研究，经过全国各方面人士的广泛讨论，又经过一年的审议和修订，它确实是比以往各种方案更为妥善，而且在今后的实践中，还可以求得进一步完善。为此，我们希望大会经过讨论之后，批准这个方案。
    这个方案经过大会批准之后，我们希望它在全国范围内逐步推行。首先今年秋季的小学语文课本和北方话区的扫盲课本中应该就用来注音，好使千万儿童和文盲在识字上减少困难。我们希望各级机关、团体在一般干部中大力提倡利用拼音字母学习普通话，为社会上推广普通话作出榜样。拼音字母容易教，容易学，一般只要二三十小时就可以学会，会说普通话或者有拼音知识的人，学起来就更快。如果我们大力推行，在第二个五年计划期间内，让全国学生和多数青年都学会拼音字母，是完全可以做到的。这对于帮助识字、扫除文盲、统一读音、推广普通话都将起巨大的推进作用，对于提高我国人民文化水平和促进社会主义建设事业有很大的利益。希望各界人士共同加以积极的宣传和提倡！
    附注
    〔直音〕直音和反切都是我国古代给汉字注音的方法，现在一部分字典中还在使用。甲字和乙字同音，用甲字来给乙字注音，叫做直音，例如“宫，音弓”。这个方法常常会发生困难：有些字如丢、嫩、耍等就没有同音的字可注；有些字的同音字是些生僻难认的字，注了等于不注，例如“宣，音瑄”。
    〔反切〕反切是用两个字来拼切一个字的音，例如“高，古牢切”。其中的“古”字即反切上字，“牢”字是反切下字。上字和下字急速连读，就能拼切出所要的音来。它的原理是这样的：“古”字的读音是gu，g是声，u是韵；“牢”的读音是lao，l是声，ao是韵；拼切的时候，“古”字只取它的g声（上字取声），“牢”字只取它的ao韵（下字取韵），g和ao相拼，就可以拼出“高”（gao）字的音来，以前没有拼音字母，反切的原理一般人不容易领会，因此很难运用。
    〔威妥玛式〕威妥玛是英国人，于一八六七年拟订一套汉语拼音方案，以后常为外国人拼写汉语所采用，至今还比较流行。他的方案使用了六个吐气符号，此外还有一些别的符号，很不方便，在实用时这些符号常常省略，以致朱、储、居、瞿四个完全不同的音都拼作chu。我们现在这个方案把这四个音区别得很清楚：朱（zhu）、储（chu）、居（ju）、瞿（qu），比威妥玛式要方便合理得多。
    〔四码电报〕汉字不能直接在一般电报机上传递，因此在发报的时候，必须先把每个汉字译成0001，0002……这样的数码，在收报的时候，要把数码再译成汉字。这种电讯传递方法，我国现在还在使用，称为“四码电报”。
