    The Glorious Test
    ——Recollections of Participants in the Defense of Brest Fortress

    One evening, I found Comrade Romanov, a participant in the defense of Brest Fortress, at a meeting of veterans of the Great Patriotic War at the Soviet Veterans Committee. Of those who participated in this legendary defense, it is said that only two hundred or so are still alive, and only a few live in Moscow. The middle-aged man sitting in front of me, who was wounded in several places but was very strong and sturdy, had experienced this severe test.
    Comrade Romanov drew a sketch on a piece of paper of the Brest Fortress, located on the western border of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Originally, this fortress, which was over a hundred years old, was not a military stronghold but simply a place where troops and their families lived. The fortress faced the German army across the river, about three hundred meters away, with the center of the river marking the border. At the time, there were not many people in the fortress.
    Romanov remembers the scene on the night the war began very clearly. At 4:15 a.m., the German invaders perfidiously attacked the fortress with intense shelling and bombing for more than an hour. At six o'clock in the morning, the German invaders crossed the river to attack, at which point groups of Soviet soldiers had already formed several positions in the fortress. The German invaders, who thought they could swagger into the fortress, tasted the first batch of retaliatory bullets here.
    As soon as the enemy's bombing started, Romanov quickly rushed out of the smoke and fire and gathered some soldiers in a hurry. The first thing to do was to go to the armory to get guns and ammunition. The armory was in the north of the fortress and required crossing a small river fifty meters wide. At this time, due to the intense enemy fire, the river water seemed to be boiling. Romanov and his comrades swam across the river under a hail of bullets and retrieved the ammunition.
    The sky was already bright. The enemy, with dozens of times more troops, attacked the fortress in waves. Romanov joined the first hand-to-hand combat. Recalling the scene of the bloody battle sixteen years ago, he said: "On the riverbank, we launched a bloody hand-to-hand combat with the fascist bandits. I was gradually surrounded by the enemy and had to temporarily put down my machine gun and stab at the enemy with my bayonet. Suddenly, my wrist was stabbed by the enemy's bayonet. Just then, Sergeant Futolomoov hit two bandits fighting with me, and I ended the life of the third with my bayonet.
    "However, the enemy's automatic riflemen, like a tide, finally pushed us back. A group of us fought and retreated to a building in the center of the fortress, occupying a firepower point. The enemy then occupied the club opposite this building. From the morning of June 22nd, a fierce bloody battle unfolded inside the fortress.
    "I remember that on the first day, I participated in twelve attacks. The enemy's shells bombarded like raindrops every moment. Our group retreated from the second floor to the first floor and finally to the basement. There was no place to set up a machine gun in the basement, so I put the machine gun on a comrade's shoulder and fired continuously for four hours.
    "The secretary of the Communist Youth League organization of the Eighty-fourth Regiment, the Armenian Mazevo Xiang, organized a fierce counterattack. A group of us also participated in this counterattack and drove the enemy out of the club position.
    "In this way, day after day, the soldiers in the Brest Fortress fought bravely and heroically with the enemy. In every corner of the fortress, bullets of revenge were fired at the enemy.
    "The fortress was already in the middle of the enemy's heavy encirclement and cut off from the outside world. The enemy attacked more than ten times a day, but it was never possible to eliminate the resistance in the fortress."
    Romanov went on to describe the difficult conditions of the defense: "The situation in the fortress was very difficult. Everywhere was burning. In the basement, there were wounded and dead comrades. There was no food, no ammunition. The soldiers who charged at the enemy had to snatch ammunition and weapons from the enemy. If there was nothing to eat, we had to eat burnt belts and burnt leather shoes. The wounded needed water, the children needed water, the heavy machine guns needed water, but the fortress, surrounded by rivers, lacked water. To go to the river to fetch a little water often required the price of life.
    "I climbed to the river twice at night to fetch water. Under the constant flashing of the enemy's rocket artillery fire, I climbed to the river, bit a small lunch box with my teeth, and brought back a lunch box of water to the comrades who needed it most in the basement."
    The soldiers in the fortress persisted in attacking the enemy in this way. Women and children also bravely helped in the fighting. Although the disparity in numbers was great, no one wavered, and no one lost their fighting will. Romanov recalled that a soldier named Betya, who was very young, only a teenager, was surrounded by the enemy during the battle. The enemy shouted for him to raise his hands. Betya raised his hands, not to surrender, but to raise his fist and rush at the enemy.
    On June 27, Romanov was ordered to break through with more than thirty people to find contact. On the night of July 1, a few of them broke out of the fortress in the chaos of battle. After that, Romanov's experiences had no connection with the Brest Fortress.
    However, the defense of Brest Fortress continued for a long time. Residents of Brest City heard intense gunfire from the fortress at the end of July and the beginning of August. Later, some inscriptions from soldiers on the verge of death were found in the fortress. One inscription read: "There are three of us left, the situation is very difficult, but we have not lost our fighting will and will die like heroes. July 1941." In the center of the fortress, a church had the following inscription: "The three of us Muscovites - Ivanov, Stepanchikov, Rongqiangyev defend this church, we swear to die and never leave here. July 1941." "Only I am left, Stepanchikov and Rongqiangyev have sacrificed. The Germans have entered the church. Only one last grenade is left, but I will never surrender alive. Comrades, avenge us!"
    The Soviet troops in Brest Fortress, in the early days of the Great Patriotic War, displayed such earth-shattering, soul-stirring heroism, foreshadowing the victory of the Great Patriotic War.

    光荣的考验
    ——记布列斯特保卫战参加者的回忆片断
    新华社记者  李楠
    一天晚上，苏联退伍军人委员会正有一批卫国战争的退伍军官在参加会议，我在这里找到了布列斯特堡垒保卫战的参加者罗曼诺夫同志。参加过这个传奇式的保卫战的人，现在生存的据说仅有二百多人，居住在莫斯科的只有少数几个人。坐在我前面的这个身上负过好几处伤但非常强壮结实的中年人，就曾经经历过这场严重的考验。
    罗曼诺夫同志在一张纸上画了一个位于白俄罗斯共和国西部边境的布列斯特堡垒的草图。原来这个已有一百多年历史的堡垒并不是什么军事要塞，只是一支军队和家属们居住的地方。堡垒和德军隔河相望，相距三百多公尺，河中心就算国界。当时堡垒的人数并不多。
    战争开始的那天夜晚的情景，罗曼诺夫记得很清楚。深夜四点十五分，德寇背信弃义地用猛烈的炮轰和轰炸来袭击这个堡垒，连续达一小时多。清早六点钟，德寇才渡河进击，这时一组一组的苏军战士已经在堡垒中构成了几处阵地。满以为可以大摇大摆地进入堡垒的德寇，在这里尝到了第一批复仇的枪弹。
    敌人轰炸刚一开始，罗曼诺夫就迅速地从硝烟火中冲了出来，在匆忙中集合了一些战士。第一件事情就是要到武器库里去取出枪枝弹药，武器仓库在堡垒北面，需要经过一条五十公尺宽的小河。这时，由于敌人的猛烈射击，河水像是沸腾了一样，罗曼诺夫和他的同志们在弹雨下面泅过河去，取了弹药回来。
    天色已经大亮了。兵力强大数十倍的敌人轮番地向堡垒冲击。罗曼诺夫投入了第一场肉搏战。他回忆这场十六年前的血战景象说：“在河岸上，我们和法西斯匪徒展开了浴血的肉搏战。我逐渐被敌人包围了，只好暂时放下机枪，用刺刀向敌人刺去。突然间，我的手腕被敌人的刺刀刺中了，正在这时，下士甫托洛莫夫击中了两个和我搏斗的匪徒，第三个被我用刺刀结束了生命。
    “但是，如潮水一样涌来的敌人自动枪手，终于把我们压向后面，我们一群人一边打，一边退到堡垒中央的一座楼房，占据了火力点。敌人则占据了这座楼房对面的俱乐部。从6月22日上午开始，在堡垒内部展开了激烈的血战。
    “记得第一天，我曾经参加了十二次攻击。敌人的炮弹每时每刻都像雨点似地轰击。我们这一批人从二楼退到一楼，最后到了地下室里面。地下室没有架机枪的地方，我把机枪放在一个同志的肩上，一连射击了四个钟头。
    “第八十四团的共青团组织书记、亚美尼亚人马捷沃襄组织了一次猛烈的反攻，我们一批人也参加了这次反攻，把敌人赶出了俱乐部阵地。
    “就这样，一天接着一天，布列斯特堡垒里的战士们同敌人进行着英勇壮烈的战斗。在堡垒的各个角落里，都有复仇的子弹向敌人射击。
    “堡垒已经处在敌人的重重包围中间，同外面断绝了联系。敌人每天攻击在十次以上，但始终不可能消灭堡垒里的抵抗。”
    罗曼诺夫接着叙述保卫战的艰苦情况说：“堡垒里的境况已经非常艰苦，到处在燃烧。在地下室里，有受伤的和牺牲了的同志。没有粮食，没有弹药。向敌人冲击的战士，还得从敌人手里抢弹药武器回来。没有吃的，就只好吃烧焦了的皮带，烧剩了的皮鞋。受了伤的人需要水，小孩需要水，重机枪需要水，但四周被河流围绕着的堡垒却缺少水。为了到河边去取回来一点水，常常需要生命的代价。
    “我晚上曾经两次爬到河边去取水，在敌人的火箭炮火不断闪耀的情况下，爬到河边，用牙齿咬着小饭盒，取回来一饭盒水，到地下室里，分给最需要的同志。”
    堡垒里的战士们就这样坚持着打击敌人。妇女儿童也奋勇地帮助作战。虽然众寡悬殊，但是没有人动摇，也没有一个人丧失战斗的意志。罗曼诺夫回忆说，一个名叫别佳的战士，很年轻，才十几岁，他在战斗时被敌人包围了，敌人高喊举起手来，别佳举起了手，不但是举手投降，而是举起捏着拳头的手向敌人扑去。
    罗曼诺夫在6月27日奉命和三十多个人一道突围去寻找联系。7月1日夜里，他们当中有少数人在混战中冲出了堡垒。以后，罗曼诺夫的遭遇就和布列斯特堡垒没有联系了。
    但是，布列斯特堡垒的保卫战还继续了很长的时间。布列斯特市的居民在7月底8月初还听到堡垒里激烈的射击。后来在堡垒里发现了一些战士们临死时的题词。一幅题字是：“我们剩下了三个，情况很困难，但我们没有丧失战斗意志，将像英雄一样死去。1941年7月”。堡垒中央的一座教堂有这样的题字：“我们三个莫斯科人——伊凡诺夫、斯捷帕奇科夫、容强耶夫保卫这座教堂，我们宣誓死也不离开这里。1941年7月”。“只剩下我一个人了，斯捷帕奇科夫和容强耶夫牺牲了。德国人已进入了教堂。只剩下了最后一个手榴弹，但我活着绝不屈服。同志们，为我们复仇啊！” 
    布列斯特堡垒里的苏军，在卫国战争的初期就是这样显示出了惊天地、泣鬼神的英雄气概，预示了卫国战争的胜利。
