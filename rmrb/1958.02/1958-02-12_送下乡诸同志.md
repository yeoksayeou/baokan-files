Sending Off Comrades Going to the Countryside
    Ye Shengtao
    Endless heartfelt wishes, respectfully stating my desires.
    Habitual labor transforms bodies and minds, learning farming makes character pure.
    Benefiting not only the community? Transforming customs involves hundreds of millions of people.
    The Great Harmony is not for oneself, all strength comes from one's own body.

    送下乡诸同志
    叶圣陶
    珍重意无尽，钦迟愿略陈。
    习劳胎骨换，学稼性情淳。
    沾益宁惟社？移风涉兆民。
    大同不为己，力悉出于身。
