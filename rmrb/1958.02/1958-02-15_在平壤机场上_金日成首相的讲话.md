    At Pyongyang Airport
    Premier Kim Il-sung's Speech
    Respected Comrade Zhou Enlai! Dear Comrades of the Delegation!
    On behalf of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and all the Korean people, I extend a warm welcome to the Government Delegation of our great neighbor—the People's Republic of China—visiting our country.
    All the Korean people who are struggling for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and for socialism welcome your visit—the visit of the representatives of the great Chinese people—with boundless joy and gratitude.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved tremendous accomplishments in the cause of building a socialist country in a very short period of time, and the Korean people are happy to regard it as their own achievement.
    The relations of friendship and cooperation established by our two peoples through a long history have been further consolidated and developed in the common struggle against the common enemy—Japanese imperialists—and in repelling the aggression of US imperialists against Korea and defending peace and socialism.
    The tremendous material and spiritual assistance given by the fraternal Chinese people to the Korean people during the war and post-war periods is one of the important guarantees for our achievement of all victories, and it infinitely encourages the Korean people to struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.
    Respected Comrade Zhou Enlai!
    Dear Comrades! The Korean people are very happy to have the opportunity to personally introduce to you the achievements they have made through their labor in the struggle for post-war reconstruction and socialist construction, and to be able to meet you today—the representatives of the fraternal Chinese people—to directly convey their love and deep friendship for the Chinese people.
    We firmly believe that your visit to our country will be a new contribution to further consolidating and developing the traditional friendly relations between the Korean and Chinese peoples, to further strengthening the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.
    Long live the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples!
