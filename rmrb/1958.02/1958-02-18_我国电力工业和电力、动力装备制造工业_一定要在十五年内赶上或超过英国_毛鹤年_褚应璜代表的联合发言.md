We fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and suggest that the conference approve them.

Since the Party Central Committee put forward the call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in the next fifteen years or a little longer, a great upsurge has been set off nationwide. It also inspires the oppressed people all over the world, making them more convinced that the leadership of the Communist Party is an invincible force. The working class in our country is promoting a great leap forward in production from various work posts with unparalleled excitement to ensure the realization of this glorious task.

　　240 Billion kWh of Electricity by 1972

　　If Britain maintains its past speed, its power generation will reach 240 billion kWh by 1972. According to our growth rate and the increase in power load, we can reach more than 240 billion kWh by 1972.

Comrades, the electric power industry and the dynamic and electric equipment manufacturing industry are two important sectors in heavy industry. Please allow us to express some opinions on the issue of these two industries also catching up with Britain in fifteen years or a little longer:

According to estimates from various sources, assuming that Britain's power generation can maintain its past growth rate in the future, its power generation will reach 240 billion kWh by 1972.

The development of China's electric power industry during the First Five-Year Plan period saw power generation increase from 7.26 billion kWh in 1952 to 19.03 billion kWh in 1957, with an average annual increase of 21.2%. According to the latest balance, it is estimated that by the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan, i.e., 1962, it will reach around 50 billion kWh, with an average annual increase of 21.3%. This is fully justified. If it increases 3.82 times in the ten years from 1962 to 1972, that is, an average annual increase of 17%, it can reach more than 240 billion kWh. Alternatively, if our electric power industry has an average annual increase of 18.5% from now on, it can catch up with Britain in fifteen years. Such a growth rate is smaller than what we have already achieved during the First Five-Year Plan and what we will achieve during the Second Five-Year Plan. Therefore, we believe that catching up with Britain is certain and assured.

Let us analyze the growth of China's electricity load: it is estimated that industrial electricity consumption will account for more than 78% of the total power generation in 1962. The growth rate of electricity consumption in several major industries will be as follows: in the ten years from 1962 to 1972, the electricity consumption of the ferrous metallurgical industry will increase more than four times due to the increase in the proportion of electric furnace steelmaking and ferroalloys; the electricity consumption of the non-ferrous metallurgical industry will increase more than six times due to the increase of aluminum by six to eight times, and the greater development of copper, tin, tungsten, lead, and zinc; the electricity consumption of the chemical industry will increase more than five times due to the large increase in the production of chemical fertilizers and chemical fibers; the electricity consumption of industries such as machinery, textiles, coal, petroleum, and building materials will increase three to four times. The electricity consumption of cities, agriculture, and transportation is still relatively low by 1962. It is estimated that by 1972, due to the improvement of the lives of the broad masses of people, the more common construction of small rural hydropower stations, and the increased length of electrified railways, the electricity consumption in these areas will increase significantly. In addition, the development of other new industries will require a large amount of electricity.

All of the above shows that it is entirely possible to estimate that electricity consumption will reach the level of more than 240 billion kWh by 1972.

　　Unlimited Prospects for the Development of the Electric Power Industry

　　Hydropower resources reach 540 million kW, and coal resources reach 1 trillion tons. Resources are not a problem. We have a rapidly growing construction force, and we are confident in completing the task.

Is it possible for us to develop such a large-scale electric power industry? It is also entirely possible!

First of all, we have abundant hydropower resources of 540 million kW and coal resources of 1 trillion tons. According to the central government's long-term construction policy of prioritizing hydropower and supplementing it with thermal power, approximately fifty hydropower plants will be built in fifteen years, many of which will have a capacity of about 1 million kW or even larger, such as Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia, Heishanxia, Longyangxia, Danjiangkou, Wuqiangxi, etc. The development of giant hydropower plants such as the Heilongjiang River and the Yangtze River can also be considered. By 1972, except for North China and East China, where the proportion of hydropower is relatively small, and the Northeast, where hydropower is still difficult to exceed 50%, all other regions will focus on hydropower construction. Looking at the coal supply again, the estimated production volume in 1972 may reach 600 million tons. If 10% to 12% of the output is used for power generation, it is entirely possible, which can generate 120 billion to 150 billion kWh. Therefore, there are no problems with hydropower resources and fuel supply. Secondly, we have a rapidly growing construction force. During the First Five-Year Plan period, with the help of experts from the Soviet Union and other democratic countries, we have gained rich experience in all aspects of survey, design, construction, and installation in power plant construction. In addition to the more than 2 million kW of power plants that have already been built, large-scale projects such as the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station with 580,000 kW designed domestically and the Liaoning High-Pressure High-Temperature Thermal Power Plant with 450,000 kW are also under construction. We have also gained construction experience in 220 kV and lower voltage transmission lines and substation projects. Judging from the growth rate of these construction forces, we are confident in completing the above tasks in fifteen years.

　　Technical Level Can Be Caught Up in Ten Years

　　With the leadership of the Party, the help of the Soviet Union, and the enthusiasm of workers and scientific and technical personnel, we can rapidly improve in equipment manufacturing. By 1962, our country will be 95% self-sufficient in the amount of power equipment.

To increase the national power generation equipment capacity by more than 50 million kilowatts in fifteen years or a little longer, we must first have sufficient production of dynamic and power equipment to meet the needs of large-scale power industry construction. During the First Five-Year Plan period, we produced medium-sized power generation equipment, transformers with voltages up to 220 kV, 110 kV switchgear, 35 kV power cables, and gained experience in various aspects of design and manufacturing, and trained thousands of technicians and skilled workers. We are now trial-producing 72,500 kW hydro-turbine generating equipment, 25,000 kW high-pressure high-temperature steam turbine generating equipment, 220 kV high-voltage electrical equipment, and are beginning to trial-produce larger capacity units and high-voltage power equipment. In terms of thermal power, 50,000 kW units can be produced in 1959, 100,000 kW units can be produced in 1961, and from the perspective of the needs of national economic development, we should strive to master the production technology of 200,000 kW units in five years. In terms of hydropower, hydro-turbine generator units of 130,000 kW or more should be produced during the Second Five-Year Plan. In terms of high-voltage power equipment, we should fully master 220 kV high-voltage electrical appliances in 1960 and strive to master the manufacturing technology of high-voltage power equipment with higher voltage levels than 220 kV in five years. In the direction of metallurgy, chemical industry, mining, and electrical transmission, we must master the most complex complete sets of equipment, such as 1,150 mm primary rolling mills, within five years. According to this rate of technological development, our hydro-turbine generating equipment and electrical transmission equipment may catch up with the technical level of Britain in five years, while steam turbine generating equipment and high-voltage power equipment will catch up with the technical level of Britain in the next ten years or a little longer. In the production of a wide range of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, switches, transformers, electric furnaces, etc., we will further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, adopt new technologies, and create a unified series of various products, and promote a high degree of standardization. This is impossible for capitalist countries. We have the potential to catch up with or even surpass the technical level of Britain in ten years.

Completing the above tasks will not be without difficulties. We have the correct leadership of the Party, the comprehensive assistance of advanced Soviet science and technology, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of all workers, scientists, and technicians. We will certainly be able to overcome any difficulties and complete this glorious task.

The growth rate of our manufacturing force during the First Five-Year Plan was very fast. The average annual growth rate of state-owned electrical machinery manufacturing departments was 32.6%, and the output value in 1957 was equivalent to 4.1 times that of 1952. During the Second Five-Year Plan, a number of large-scale modern dynamic and power equipment enterprises, such as the new steam turbine generator and hydro-turbine workshops of the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, the Harbin Steam Turbine Factory, the Boiler Factory, the Xi'an High-Voltage Switch Factory, and the Transformer Factory, will be put into production one after another. The manufacturing force will grow even faster. The dynamic and power equipment manufacturing departments should strive to achieve a level of domestic self-sufficiency of more than 95% in the national equipment demand by 1962. In the ten years from 1962 to 1972, the demand for both power generation equipment and power consumption equipment will increase dramatically. In addition to making every effort to tap the potential of existing enterprises and increase varieties and output, a number of power generation equipment and high-voltage electrical appliance factories, heavy electrical machinery and small and medium-sized motor electrical appliance factories, rectifier equipment factories, cable factories, etc., with large production capacity will be built and completed in the early stages of the Third Five-Year Plan to ensure that the variety and output of dynamic, power equipment, and general electrical appliances comprehensively meet the needs of the high-speed growth of power generation and power consumption during the Third and Fourth Five-Year Plans. This is the sign of our equipment manufacturing industry catching up with Britain in fifteen years. Based on the construction experience accumulated during the First Five-Year Plan, we are fully confident in designing and building the above-mentioned enterprises and putting them into production within the scheduled time.

　　The Following Four Issues Should Be Paid Attention To

　　1. Comprehensively Implement the Policy of Building the Country with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results and Diligence and Thrift;
　　2. Scientific Research Work Must Be Carried Out Quickly;
　　3. The Raw Material Industry Must Actively Support;
　　4. Solve the Problems of Power Generation, Transmission, Distribution, and Power Consumption Equipment.

In order to complete the glorious task of catching up with Britain in the output of the electric power industry and the dynamic and power equipment manufacturing industry, we believe that the following issues should be paid attention to:

First, the construction of the electric power industry must comprehensively implement the policy of building the country with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and diligence and thrift, combining large, medium, and small, and using the least amount of money to do the most things. To save construction investment and accelerate construction speed, we should: 1. In areas where the electric power industry already has a certain foundation, or in areas with faster development, large-scale power generation equipment should be used as much as possible, as long as it is suitable, according to the specific conditions of each power system. For example, building a 100,000 kW thermal power plant requires 62.26 million yuan to use four 25,000 kW units, while it only requires 50.77 million yuan to use one 100,000 kW unit, which can save an investment of 11.49 million yuan. This can also save steel, non-ferrous metals, and other materials. The construction speed can also be accelerated, and the capacity that can be built with the same construction force is much larger. Although the proportion of equipment costs in hydropower plants is relatively small, a certain capacity of power plant requires less investment to use large units than small units. Of course, this also requires manufacturing to meet the construction requirements as much as possible.

2. The use of open-air or semi-open-air power plants can not only save investment and steel and cement, but also shorten construction time. Except for particularly cold regions, it should be actively adopted. This requires the power construction work to take new measures, and on the other hand, equipment manufacturing must be able to meet the technical requirements.

3. Starting from the principle of finding ways to overcome difficulties with 600 million people, it must be earnestly applied to the construction of the electric power industry. In the construction of power plants, transmission lines, and substations, we should combine with the specific conditions of our country and adopt new technologies in many aspects to save materials and investment. Simplifying the power system and thermal system of power plants and reducing unnecessary standby equipment without reducing the reliability of regional power supply is of great significance. In particular, small and medium-sized power plants should pay more attention to lowering standards and strive to save.

4. In order to simplify equipment manufacturing and accelerate the construction of the electric power industry, it is necessary to vigorously compile standard designs. Standard designs for small and medium-sized power plants should also be emphasized, which is of great help to local construction. At the same time, the complete supply of dynamic and power equipment is also
It is an important measure to save investment and accelerate construction. This has not been done well enough in the past, and we should pay attention to improving it in future work.

Second, as the electric power system expands, the technical requirements are getting higher and higher, which urgently requires vigorous scientific research work in order to enable the technical level of the electric power industry to keep up with the ever-growing needs.

In order to ensure the high-speed development of the dynamic and power equipment industry, scientific research work must also be carried out quickly. Scientific research on dynamics and power equipment must serve the development of new products, and must be carried out through extensive coordination, organizing all possible concentrated forces, and working together. We must organize the research forces of domestic enterprises and universities, and also obtain the support of the Soviet Union and socialist countries with their tremendous scientific forces through international cooperation. Scientific research and experimental bases are the main link to ensure scientific research. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, we should strive to establish or enrich scientific research and experimental stations according to the main product types in the dynamic and power equipment manufacturing industry, so that all dynamic and power equipment can undergo comprehensive testing and make correct conclusions, which can play a decisive role in developing new products, improving technical levels, and improving quality. The establishment of scientific research and experimental bases requires national investment. We must always follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee on building the country diligently and thriftily and running science diligently and thriftily, learn from the hard-working and simple style of Soviet scientific research institutions, and give full play to the collective wisdom and collective labor of scientific and technical personnel to build complete and excellent scientific research and experimental stations with the least amount of money.

The Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement signed in Moscow on January 18 this year will enable our country to comprehensively carry out scientific research work and create favorable conditions with the selfless help of the Soviet Union. The electric power industry, the dynamic and power equipment manufacturing industry, like other industrial sectors, must fully utilize this positive factor, carry out scientific research work more quickly, ensure the high-speed development of industry, and achieve the glorious task of catching up with Britain in fifteen years.

Third, the development of electrical equipment manufacturing is largely determined by the active support of the raw material industry. The use of new electrical materials can greatly reduce the volume and weight of electrical equipment, improve technical and economic indicators, and may produce super-giant, high-parameter motors and electrical appliances, which is also one aspect of our catching up with Britain. During the First Five-Year Plan period, there were still many problems in the production of electrical materials, power equipment, and materials required for power plant construction by China's steel industry and chemical industry, whether in terms of variety, quality, or output. The Second Five-Year Plan needs to produce electrical equipment with higher parameters and mass-produce new unified series of motors, electrical appliances, and cables. The metallurgical department needs to supply high-quality cold-rolled silicon steel sheets in large quantities from 1959, and the chemical industry needs to supply high-temperature-resistant insulating materials and advanced plastics for manufacturing cables, such as polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, etc., in large quantities. We believe that the metallurgical and chemical industry departments will be able to provide strong support to the new electrical materials urgently needed by the electrical appliance industry and the steel pipes and steel materials needed for the construction of power equipment and power plants when fully launching a great leap in production.

Fourth, within fifteen years, it is not only necessary to solve the production of a large number of power generation, transmission, and distribution equipment, but also to solve a larger number of power consumption equipment. For the latter question, we suggest that we first make unified arrangements and, in accordance with the principle of running enterprises with diligence and thrift, carry out technical transformation, equipment renewal, and adopt new technologies for the original state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private electrical engineering enterprises in a planned way to greatly improve their labor productivity and increase output. At the same time, we must also strengthen technical cooperation between state-owned and local enterprises, organize them, and carry out research, design, and production of unified series of major electrical industrial products. This is a fundamental measure to further increase varieties and increase output. While fully tapping the potential of existing enterprises, we must also consider building and expanding a number of state-owned and local electrical engineering enterprises in a planned way to meet the huge needs of all aspects of the national economy for electrical products within fifteen years.

Comrades! We have the most superior socialist system, we have the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have 600 million awakened people, and after the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle and the great debate of blooming and contending, socialist enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly enhanced. The employees of our electric power industry and dynamic and power equipment manufacturing industry are also riding the wind and waves with the people of the whole country, and are drumming up their energy. Internationally, we also have the help of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries with the most advanced science and technology, and we are by no means isolated. We have overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan and have gained a lot of construction experience, laying a solid foundation for larger-scale construction in the future. These experiences were gained by learning from the Soviet Union. In the future, our tasks will be more arduous and the required technical level will be higher. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and learn those things that are suitable for our country's situation. Therefore, we have full confidence in completing this great task, and we can not only catch up with Britain in output, but also in technology.

    我国电力工业和电力、动力装备制造工业
    一定要在十五年内赶上或超过英国
    毛鹤年　褚应璜代表的联合发言
    我们完全同意并衷心拥护李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理和吴玉章主任所作的各项报告，建议大会予以通过。
    自从党中央提出要在今后十五年或者稍多一点的时间内，我国在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面，赶上或者超过英国的号召以后，已经在全国范围内掀起了一个极大热潮。并且鼓舞着全世界被压迫人民，使他们更相信共产党的领导是无往不胜的巨大力量。我国工人阶级正以无比兴奋的心情，从各个工作岗位上促使生产大跃进，来保证实现这一光荣任务。
    1972年发电  二千四百亿度
    英国保持过去速度，到1972年发电量将达二千四百亿度；根据我们的增长速度和电力负荷上长情况，1972年能达到二千四百亿度以上。
    各位代表，电力工业和动力、电力装备制造工业是重工业中间的两项重要部门，请允许我们就这两项工业也能在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内赶上英国的问题发表一些意见：
    据各方面的估计，假定英国的发电量今后的增长能保持过去的上长速度，到一九七二年发电量将达到两千四百亿度。
    我国电力工业的发展，在第一个五年计划期间，发电量由一九五二年的七十二亿六千万度增长到一九五七年的一百九十亿三千万度，平均每年上长了百分之二十一点二。据最近的平衡，第二个五年计划最后一年，即一九六二年，预计将达到五百亿度上下，平均每年上长百分之二十一点三。这是有充分根据的。从一九六二年到一九七二年的十年间，如果增加三点八二倍，即每年平均上长百分之十七，就可以达到两千四百亿度以上。或者，从现在算起，如果我们的电力工业每年平均有百分之十八点五的上长，就可以在十五年内赶上英国。这样一个上长速度比我们第一个五年计划已经作到的和第二个五年计划将要实现的都要小，因此我们认为赶上英国是肯定的，是有把握的。
  让我们分析一下我国电力负荷上长情况：一九六二年工业用电估计约占全部发电量的百分之七十八以上。几个主要工业的用电量的上长速度将是这样的：一九六二年到一九七二年的十年间，黑色冶金工业用电由于电炉炼钢及铁合金的比重增加，将增加四倍以上；有色冶金工业用电，由于铝增加六倍到八倍，铜，锡，钨，铅，锌将有更大的发展，将增加六倍以上；化学工业用电，由于化学肥料和化学纤维产量将有很大增加，将增加五倍以上；机械，纺织，煤炭，石油，建筑材料等工业的用电将增加三倍到四倍。城市，农业，交通运输用电量到一九六二年还比较低，估计到一九七二年由于广大人民生活的改善，农村小型水电厂的较普遍的建设，电气化铁路的长度增加，这几方面的用电会有较多的增长。另外，还有其他新的工业的发展更需要大量的电能。
    以上这些，说明了估计到一九七二年用电量达到两千四百多亿度的水平是完全有可能的。
    电力工业发展前途无限
    水力资源达五亿四千万瓩，煤炭资源达一万亿吨，资源不成问题；我们有迅速增长的建设力量，完成任务有把握。
    我们发展这样大规模的电力工业有没有可能呢？也是完全可能的！
    首先，我们有丰富的五亿四千万瓩的水力资源和一万亿吨的煤炭资源。按照中央水电为主，火电为辅的长期建设方针，十五年内将建成大约五十多个水电厂，其中不少是一百万瓩左右或更大的容量的，如三门峡，刘家峡，黑山峡，龙羊峡，丹江口，五强溪等等。还可考虑如黑龙江、长江等巨型水电厂的开发。到一九七二年全国各地区除华北、华东水电比重较小，东北水电也还难超过百分之五十外，其余各地区均将着重水电建设。再从煤炭供应来看，一九七二年估计生产量可能达到六亿吨，如以百分之十到十二的产量用于发电是完全可能的，这样就可以发电一千二百亿度到一千五百亿度。因此，在水力的资源上和燃料的供应上都是没有问题的。其次，我们有迅速增长的建设力量，第一个五年计划期间，在电厂的建设中，我们在苏联以及各民主国家专家的帮助下已经取得了勘察、设计、建筑、安装各方面的丰富经验；除去已经建成了二百多万瓩发电厂外，并且由国内自己设计的五十八万瓩的新安江水电站和辽宁四十五万瓩的高压高温火电厂等大型工程也正在施工。二十二万伏及其以下的送电线和变电站工程也取得了建设经验。从这些建设力量上长的速度来看，我们在十五年内完成上述的任务是有把握的。
    技术水平十年就能赶上
    我们有党的领导、苏联的帮助、工人和科学技术人员的干劲，能在装备制造方面迅速提高。到1962年，我国就要自给电力设备量的95％。
    在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内全国发电设备容量要增加五千万瓩以上，首先就必须有足够的动力和电力装备的生产来满足大规模电力工业建设的需要。我们在第一个五年计划期间生产了中型的发电设备，电压到二十二万伏的变压器，十一万伏的开关设备，三万五千伏的电力电缆，并取得了设计和制造上各方面的经验，培养了数以千计的技术人员与技术工人，现在正试制七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电设备，二万五千瓩的高压高温汽轮发电设备，二十二万伏的高压电气，并开始试制更大容量的机组，和高压电力装备。火力方面，一九五九年即可生产五万瓩机组，一九六一年生产十万瓩机组，并且从国民经济发展的需要来看，应该争取在五年后掌握二十万瓩机组的生产技术。水力方面，要在第二个五年计划内生产十三万瓩以上的水轮发电机组。高压电力装备方面，要在一九六○年全面掌握二十二万伏的高压电器并争取在五年后掌握比二十二万伏更高一级电压的高压电力装备的制造技术。冶金、化工、采矿、电气传动方向，要在五年内掌握最复杂的，例如一千一百五十公厘初轧机那样的成套设备。按照这样的技术发展速度，我们的水轮发电设备和电气传动设备就可能在五年后赶上英国技术水平，而在汽轮发电设备及高压电力装备方面将在今后十年或者稍多一点的时间内赶上英国技术水平。在广大的电器设备生产方面，例如电动机，开关，变压器，电炉等，我们将进一步学习苏联先进经验，采用新技术并创制各类产品的统一系列，推行高度的标准化这是资本主义国家所不可能作到的。我们有可能在十年内赶上甚至超过英国的技术水平。
    完成以上任务，不会没有困难。我们有党的正确领导，有苏联先进科学技术的全面帮助，有全体工人、科学技术人员的革命干劲，我们一定能够克服任何困难，完成这样的光荣任务。
    我们第一个五年计划中间制造力量的增长速度是很快的，国营电机制造部门平均年增长速度为百分之三十二点六，一九五七年产值相当于一九五二年的四点一倍。第二个五年计划里还有一批大型的现代化的动力、电力装备企业如哈尔滨电机厂汽轮发电机与水轮机新车间，哈尔滨汽轮机厂、锅炉厂、西安高压开关厂、变压器厂等都要陆续投入生产。制造力量就将更加迅速增长起来。动力、电力装配制造部门要争取到一九六二年在全国设备需要量中达到国内自给百分之九十五以上的水平。从一九六二到一九七二年的十年内，无论在发电设备和用电设备方面的需要量都是飞跃增长的。除尽量挖掘原有企业的潜在力量，增加品种与产量外，还将在第三个五年的初期，建设完成一批生产力大的发电设备与高压电器工厂，重电机和中小型电机电器工厂，整流设备工厂，电缆工厂等，保证在动力、电力装备及一般电器的品种与产量方面全面满足第三及第四个五年计划发电与用电量高速度增长的需要。这是我们装备制造工业在十五年内赶上英国的标志，根据第一个五年计划期间积累的建设经验，我们完全有把握设计和建设上述的企业，并在预定的时间内投入生产。
    应该注意以下四个问题
    一、全面贯彻多快好省、勤俭建国方针；
    二、必须迅速开展科学研究工作；
    三、原材料工业必须积极支援；
    四、解决发电输配电和用电设备问题。
    为了完成电力工业和动力、电力装备制造工业的产量赶上英国的光荣任务，我们认为应注意以下几个问题：
    第一，电力工业建设必须全面贯彻多快好省、勤俭建国的方针，大中小相结合，要用最少的钱办最多的事。节约建设投资，加速建设速度就应当：1、在电力工业已有一定基础的地区，或是发展较速的地区，应按各个电力系统的具体情况，只要适宜用大型发电设备，应尽量采用大型的。例如，建设一个十万瓩的火力发电厂，用四台两万五千瓩机组需要六千二百二十六万元，而用一台十万瓩机组只要五千零七十七万元，就可以节约投资一千一百四十九万元。这样还可以节约钢材，有色金属以及其他材料。在建设速度上也可以加快，以同样的建设力量，可以建设的容量要大的多。水电厂的设备费所占比重虽然比较小些，但是，一定容量的电厂，用大型机组要比小型的还是要节省不少投资。当然，这也就需要制造上能尽量满足建设上的要求。
    2、采用露天式或半露天式的电厂不仅可以节省投资，节约钢材，水泥，还可以缩短建设时间。除去特别寒冷的地区外，应当积极采用。这一方面要求电力建设工作采取新的措施，另一方面，设备制造上也必须能满足技术上的要求。
    3、从六亿人口出发，想穷办法的原则，要切实的用在电力工业建设上面。在发电厂以及送电线路、变电站的建设中应结合我国具体情况，从多方面采用新技术，以节约器材，节约投资。设法简化发电厂的电力系统和热力系统，在不降低地区供电可靠性的原则下，减少不必要的备用设备，是具有重大意义的。特别是中小型电厂更应注意降低标准，力求节约。
      4、为了设备制造的简化，加速电力工业建设，就需要大力编制标准设计。还应重视中小型电厂的标准设计，这对于地方上的建设有极大的帮助。同时动力、电力装备的成套供应也
  是节约投资加速建设的重要措施。这在过去作的还不够好，要在今后工作中加以注意改进。
    第二，在日益扩大的电力系统中，技术要求越来越高，就迫切需要大力开展科学研究工作，才能使电力工业的技术水平赶上不断增长的需要。
    为了保证动力与电力装备工业的高速度发展，也必须迅速开展科学研究工作。动力与电力装备的科学研究，一定要为发展新产品服务，必须通过广泛的协调，组织一切可能集中的力量，通力合作。我们要组织国内企业和高等学校的研究力量，也要通过国际合作，获得苏联及社会主义国家巨大科学力量的支援。科学研究试验基地是保证进行科学研究的主要环节。第二个五年计划时期，争取做到在动力、电力装备制造工业部门里，按主要产品型类，分别建立或充实科学研究试验站，使一切动力与电力装备，都能进行全面的试验而作出正确的结论，这对于发展新产品，提高技术水平，改进质量，都能起决定的作用。建立科学研究试验基地，是需要国家投资的。我们一定要时时刻刻遵照党中央勤俭建国勤俭办科学的指示，学习苏联科学研究机构艰苦朴素的作风，发挥科学技术人员的集体智慧与集体劳动，用最少的钱，建设完整而精良的科学研究试验站。
    今年一月十八日在莫斯科签订的中苏科学技术合作议定书，将使我国在苏联的无私帮助下，全面开展科学研究工作，创造有利条件。电力工业，动力及电力装备制造工业也和其他工业部门一样，一定要充分利用这个积极因素，更快地开展科学研究工作，保证工业高速度发展，实现十五年赶上英国的光荣任务。
    第三，电力装备制造的发展，在很大的程度上决定于原材料工业的积极支援。采用新的电工材料可以大大缩小电力装备的体积和重量，提高技术经济指标而且有可能生产出超巨型，高参数的电机电器，这也是我们赶上英国的一个方面。我国钢铁工业与化学工业在第一个五年计划时期对电工材料、动力装备以及电厂建设所需要的材料的生产，无论是品种、质量或者是产量，都还存在不少的问题。第二个五年计划要生产更高参数的电力装备以及大量生产新型统一系列的电机电器与电缆，需要冶金部门从一九五九年起大量供应高质量的冷轧矽钢片，化学工业大量供应耐高温的绝缘材料与制造电缆的高级塑料如聚氯乙烯、聚苯乙烯等。我们相信冶金和化学工业部门，在全面开展生产大跃进的时候，一定能够给电器工业所迫切需要的新型电工材料，给动力装备及电厂建设所需要的钢管、钢材等以大力支援。
    第四，十五年内不仅要解决大量发电输配电设备的生产问题，还必须解决更大数量的用电设备。对于后一个问题，我们建议首先要统一安排，根据勤俭办企业的原则，有步骤地对原有国营、地方国营及公私合营电工企业进行技术改造，设备更新，采用新技术，以大大提高它们的劳动生产率，增加产量。同时也要加强国营与地方企业之间的技术合作，组织起来，进行电器工业主要产品统一系列的研究、设计和生产工作，这是进一步增加品种、增加产量的根本措施。在充分发掘现有企业潜在力量的同时，也要考虑有步骤地新建和扩建一批国营和地方的电工企业，以满足十五年内国民经济各方面对电器产品的巨大需要。
    各位代表！我们有最优越的社会主义社会制度，我们有中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，我们有觉悟了的六亿人民，经过反右派斗争的胜利和大鸣大放大辩论之后，社会主义积极性空前提高。我们电力工业和动力、电力装备制造工业的职工们也正在同全国人民一道乘风破浪，鼓起干劲。在国际上又有科学技术最先进的苏联和各兄弟国家的帮助，我们绝不是孤立的。我们超额的完成了第一个五年计划，取得了很多的建设经验，为今后更大规模的建设打下了巩固的基础。我们这些经验是由于学习苏联所获得的。今后我们的任务更加繁重，要求的技术水平更高，我们一定要遵照毛主席所指示的，必须认真学习苏联的先进经验，学那些和我国情况相适合的东西。因此，我们有充分信心完成这个伟大任务，不但能够在产量上，而且能够在技术上赶上英国。
