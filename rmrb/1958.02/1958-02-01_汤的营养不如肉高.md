Why?

　　Soup is Not as Nutritious as Meat
    When using old hens or beef to simmer soup, the soup is very delicious, but the meat loses its flavor. Therefore, people generally believe that the soup is more nutritious than the meat, and the meat is just "dregs." Chicken soup, in particular, is often regarded as a "tonic."
    In fact, this statement is unscientific. According to analysis, the protein contained in meat soup accounts for only about 10% of the protein content in the meat; the fat content is also very small; as for the minerals contained in meat soup, although it accounts for 25% to 60% of the content in the meat, the content of minerals in meat itself is not much, so the content of minerals in meat soup is also limited.
    However, the soup contains "nitrogenous compounds," which can strongly stimulate gastric juice secretion, help digestion, and increase appetite. Therefore, when gastric acid is deficient or the appetite is poor, eating some chicken soup or meat soup can still be helpful.
    If we regard chicken soup and meat soup as "tonics," drinking only the soup without eating the meat would be a great pity. This is inappropriate from both a nutritional and an economic point of view. (Li Qi)

### 汤的营养不如肉高

专栏：为什么？

　　汤的营养不如肉高
    用老母鸡或牛肉煨汤，汤很鲜，肉失味。因此一般人认为汤比肉还富于营养，肉只不过是“渣”罢了。特别是鸡汤，常被人当作“补品”。
    其实，这种说法是不科学的。据分析：肉汤中所含的蛋白质，仅占肉中含量的10％左右；脂肪含量也很少；至于肉汤中所含的矿物质虽然占肉中含量的25％——60％，但肉类本身矿物质的含量就不多，因此肉汤中矿物质的含量也就有限了。
    但是，汤里含有“含氮化合物”，它能强烈地刺激胃液分泌，帮助消化，增进食欲。因此当胃酸缺乏或胃口不好时，吃些鸡汤、肉汤，还是有帮助的。
    如果我们把鸡汤、肉汤当作“补品”，光喝汤而不吃肉，那就太可惜了。这无论从营养角度或经济观点来看，都是不合适的。　（李琪）
