    The Soviet government issued a statement on the 20th, fully supporting the joint statement by the Chinese and North Korean governments regarding the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea in batches before the end of 1958, and advocating for the convening of a conference of relevant countries to discuss measures to promote rapprochement between the two parts of Korea. This is a positive proposal to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    The Korean armistice has been in effect for over four years, but due to the United States' insistence on its policy of aggression against Korea, Korea remains divided and in a state of confrontation between the North and the South. This not only violates the national interests of the Korean people but also makes this region a continuing source of tension in the Far East and the world. In the current international situation, this state of affairs in Korea seems particularly unreasonable. Therefore, the Korean people's call for the peaceful reunification of their motherland is growing louder day by day. At the same time, all those concerned about peace in Korea agree that the time is ripe for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and that all relevant countries should negotiate to provide favorable conditions and guarantees so that the Korean people can solve their own problems. Precisely because of this, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward the important proposal for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Chinese government actively supported and responded to this proposal, and after consultations between the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai and the Korean government, and with the consent of the Chinese People's Volunteers, it was decided to withdraw all Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. This has created favorable conditions and a good atmosphere for convening a conference of relevant countries to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    Promoting and guaranteeing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue through international consultations among relevant countries has always been the consistent position of Korea, China, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries. At the same time, the Korean Armistice Agreement also stipulates that a political conference should be held within a certain period after the armistice to discuss the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the United States has consistently obstructed, rejected, and undermined international consultations on the Korean issue. It is for this reason that the political conference did not materialize, the Geneva Conference failed to reach an agreement on the Korean issue, and the proposals repeatedly put forward by the Korean, Chinese, and Soviet governments to convene a conference of relevant countries to discuss the Korean issue have all been unreasonably rejected by the United States.
    One of the main excuses the United States has consistently used for refusing to resolve the Korean issue through a conference of relevant countries is that the Korean issue should be resolved through the United Nations. However, as everyone knows, due to the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations has been placed in the position of one of the belligerents in the Korean War, and therefore it has completely lost any qualification and moral authority to deal fairly with the Korean issue. The resolutions on the Korean issue passed by the United States through its manipulation of the voting machine in the United Nations, without the participation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, without the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China, and in the face of opposition from the Soviet Union and many Asian countries, are fundamentally illegal and invalid. These shameful resolutions and the so-called "basic principles" concerning the Korean issue have long been proven to be absolutely incapable of leading to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. If the United States now insists on bringing out these absurd arguments, insisting on resolving the Korean issue through the United Nations, which is one of the belligerents, and insisting on the United Nations supervising the elections in Korea, it can only further expose its lack of sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue in front of the people of the world.
    The basic principle for resolving the Korean issue should be to allow the Korean people to handle their own problems under conditions free from all external interference. The proposal put forward by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for consultations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea on an equal footing is completely reasonable. And the responsibility of the relevant countries lies in guaranteeing these conditions for the Korean people free from external interference, and the first thing to do is to withdraw all foreign troops. We fully agree with the Soviet government's proposal to convene a conference of relevant countries, and we believe that this will greatly help to promote rapprochement and consultations between North and South Korea and to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    The Soviet Union not only helped the Korean people liberate the northern part of Korea from Japanese colonial rule twelve years ago but has also made unremitting efforts to promote Korea's independence, freedom, and peaceful reunification. The Soviet government's statement this time is another major contribution to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. It is clear that, like other important international issues, if the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully, it will have a significant impact on world peace. Therefore, we believe that all countries and peoples concerned about peace in the Far East and the world should seriously consider the series of proposals put forward by the Korean, Chinese, and Soviet governments and take active steps to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

### 苏联的积极建议

    苏联的积极建议
    苏联政府二十日发表声明，完全支持我国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于中国人民志愿军在1958年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜问题的联合声明，并且主张召开有关国家会议，讨论促进朝鲜两部分接近的措施。这是推动朝鲜问题和平解决的积极建议。
    朝鲜停战已经四年多，但是由于美国坚持对朝鲜的侵略政策，朝鲜至今仍然处于南北分裂和对峙的状态。这不仅违反朝鲜人民的民族利益，而且也使得这一地区继续成为远东和世界紧张局势的根源之一。在目前国际形势下，朝鲜的这种状况尤其显得不合理。因此，朝鲜人民要求实现祖国和平统一的呼声，正日益高昂。同时，一切关心朝鲜和平的人们也一致认为，和平解决朝鲜问题的时机已经成熟，一切有关国家应该进行协商，提供有利的条件和保证，以便朝鲜人民自己解决自己的问题。正是因为这样，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提出一切外国军队撤出朝鲜和朝鲜和平统一问题的重要建议，中国政府积极支持和响应这一建议，并且经过以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团同朝鲜政府的协商，和征得中国人民志愿军的同意，决定从朝鲜全部撤出中国人民志愿军。这就为召开有关国家会议，讨论和平解决朝鲜问题，创造了有利的条件和良好的气氛。
    通过有关国家的国际协商，促进和保证朝鲜问题的和平解决，这本来是朝鲜、中国、苏联和其他爱好和平国家的一贯主张。同时，朝鲜停战协定也规定，要在停战之后的一定期间内举行政治会议，以讨论朝鲜的和平统一问题。但是，美国在朝鲜问题上是始终阻挠、拒绝和破坏国际协商的。正是因为这个缘故，政治会议没有开成，日内瓦会议也没有能够就朝鲜问题达成协议，而后来朝鲜、中国和苏联政府所一再提出的召开有关国家会议讨论朝鲜问题的建议，也一概遭到了美国的无理拒绝。
    美国历来拒绝通过有关国家会议来协商解决朝鲜问题的一个主要借口是朝鲜问题应该通过联合国来解决。但是，尽人皆知，由于美国的操纵，联合国已被置于朝鲜战争中交战一方的地位，因此它完全失去了公平处理朝鲜问题的任何资格和道义力量。联合国在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表出席的情况下，在中华人民共和国的合法权利被非法剥夺的情况下，以及在苏联和亚洲许多国家共同反对的情况下，由美国操纵表决机器所通过的关于朝鲜问题的决议，根本是非法的无效的。这些可耻的决议及其有关朝鲜问题的所谓“基本原则”，早已被证明是绝对不可能导致朝鲜问题的和平解决。如果现在美国还要搬出这些荒谬的主张，硬要通过作为交战一方的联合国来解决朝鲜问题，硬要由联合国来监督朝鲜的选举，那只能在全世界人民面前，进一步暴露它没有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意而已。
    解决朝鲜问题的基本原则，应该是在解除一切外来干涉的条件下，让朝鲜人民自己处理自己的问题。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提出来的关于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜在对等基础上进行协商，是完全合理的。而有关国家的责任则在于保证给朝鲜人民不受外力干涉的这种条件，首先就是要撤出一切外国军队。我们完全赞成苏联政府所提出的召开有关国家会议的建议，并且认为，这对于促进南北朝鲜之间的接近和协商，推动朝鲜问题的和平解决，会有很大的帮助。
    苏联不仅在十二年前帮助朝鲜人民从日本殖民统治下解放了朝鲜的北部，而且为促进朝鲜的独立自由与和平统一作了坚持不懈的努力。苏联政府这一次的声明，是对于和平解决朝鲜问题的又一重大贡献。很显然，正同其他的重要国际问题一样，朝鲜问题如果能够和平解决，对于全世界的和平将发生重大影响。因此，我们认为：一切关心远东和世界和平的国家和人民，都应该郑重考虑朝鲜、中国和苏联政府的一系列建议，并且采取积极步骤，来推动朝鲜问题的和平解决。
