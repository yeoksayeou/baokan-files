The confirmation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is not only conducive to all ethnic groups learning Chinese, but also serves as a common foundation for the creation and reform of writing systems for ethnic minorities in our country.
I fully agree with and warmly support the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.
Now I will say a few words specifically about the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme.
The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is a beneficial tool for mutual learning and cultural communication among all ethnic groups. Ethnic minorities can more conveniently receive help from the Han people by learning Chinese.
As we victoriously complete the First Five-Year Plan and confidently embark on the Second Five-Year Plan, in order to meet the great leap forward requirements of socialist economic construction, our cultural and educational undertakings are developing actively and advancing at the same pace. There is a demand to eradicate illiteracy and universalize education more quickly throughout the country; to vigorously promote Putonghua (Mandarin), so that Chinese becomes more unified in order to better serve socialist construction; at the same time, it also requires all ethnic groups to break down language barriers, unite more closely, accelerate the pace, and jointly develop and prosper on the road of socialism. The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is an indispensable tool to meet the above requirements.
The adoption of the Latin alphabet in the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is very correct. The Latin alphabet has simple strokes, is symmetrical and beautiful, has clear shapes, is easy to recognize and write, and is the most widely used alphabet system in the world. Currently, more than six hundred million people in more than sixty countries around the world have adopted writing systems based on the Latin alphabet. Facts have proven that it does indeed have a high degree of adaptability for spelling various types of languages of different ethnic groups. Our use of it to spell Chinese and the languages of other ethnic groups can fully reflect the characteristics of each language, which is actually an internationalized form of alphabet, with nationalized specific application.
As Comrade Wu Yuzhang said in his report: "This draft has been studied by experts for a long time, discussed repeatedly by all parties, and revised many times. It truly reflects the opinions of the majority of those who participated in the discussion." This scheme has many advantages, and it is indeed a relatively mature and complete scheme. It is hoped that after this scheme is discussed and approved by the congress, it can be vigorously promoted in various places soon.
For eight years, through various specific facts, the people of all ethnic groups have deeply realized that the happiness of ethnic minorities cannot be separated from the leadership of the Party, the friendly unity of all ethnic groups, and the brotherly help of the great Han people. The Han people, who account for 94 percent of the country's total population, are ahead in terms of economy, culture, science, and technology due to historical reasons. In order to get rid of backwardness faster, develop into advanced ethnic groups, and jointly build socialism, all ethnic minorities must learn the advanced culture, science, philosophy, and economic production of the Han people by learning Chinese. In the past, for a long time, our ethnic minorities have made great efforts to learn Chinese and absorb nourishment from the advanced culture of the Han people. However, the difficult-to-read, difficult-to-recognize, difficult-to-remember, and difficult-to-write Chinese characters are indeed difficult barriers to overcome on the path of learning Chinese for all ethnic groups! Now, with this phonetic alphabet scheme to annotate Chinese characters, as a beneficial tool to help literacy, unify pronunciation, and promote Putonghua, and as a beneficial tool for mutual learning and cultural communication among all ethnic groups, it is foreseeable that the improvement of our people's culture will inevitably leap forward at an unprecedented speed in the future.
Ethnic minorities learning Chinese is not mutually contradictory or mutually exclusive with developing their own languages, but rather mutually related and mutually promoting.
Ethnic minorities learning Chinese and all ethnic groups developing their own languages and writing systems according to necessity and possibility are not mutually contradictory or mutually exclusive, but rather mutually related and mutually promoting. That is to say: in the big family of the motherland, where there is equality, fraternity, unity, and cooperation, as members of this family, fraternal ethnic groups enjoying equal rights, having a common language for mutual communication among all ethnic groups while developing and using their own ethnic languages does not mean the decline and weakening of the role of their own language. On the contrary, this will only be more conducive to each other's exchanges, and more conducive to the prosperity of the nation and the enrichment and development of language. In fact, Chinese has become the second mother tongue of all ethnic groups in our country. The highly developed, rich, and beautiful Chinese language has been and will continue to be an inexhaustible source for enriching the languages of all ethnic groups. On the other hand, ethnic minorities who master their own ethnic languages and writing systems can also learn Chinese faster and more effectively through reference and comparison.
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the People's Government have made tremendous efforts to help all ethnic groups develop their own languages and writing systems. Starting in 1950, the Chinese Academy of Sciences successively dispatched linguists and ethnic language workers to various ethnic minority areas to investigate the languages of various ethnic groups. Now, twenty-one writing schemes have been designed for sixteen ethnic groups. Ethnic groups whose writing problems have not yet been solved are studying ways to solve them. Nations that already have writing systems are continuing to study reform schemes. In studying and solving these problems, everyone deeply felt that in order to avoid inconsistencies in the letters of various ethnic languages, which would cause confusion and difficulties in future mutual learning and exchange, the letter forms of various ethnic languages should be as convergent as possible. To this end, in October 1956, a "Symposium on Letter Forms of Ethnic Languages" was held. The representatives who attended unanimously agreed that: "In order to facilitate the learning of the advanced culture of the Han people and to facilitate cultural exchanges among ethnic groups, the letter forms of various ethnic minority languages based on the Latin alphabet should be as consistent as possible with the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, that is, the same letters should be used to express the same, similar, or corresponding sounds." This fully reflects the common desire of the people of all ethnic minorities. Last October, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee studied several principles for designing letters in ethnic minority language schemes while discussing the Zhuang script scheme, and believed that ethnic minorities should base their writing on the Latin alphabet when creating writing; when existing writing is reformed and a new letter system is adopted, it should also be based on the Latin alphabet as much as possible. Regarding the relationship between letters and sounds, it is believed that the same or similar sounds between ethnic minority languages and Chinese should be represented as much as possible by the corresponding letters in the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme.
Everyone believes that the writing of various ethnic groups, especially writing of languages with close relationships, should be as consistent as possible in letter forms and spelling rules. Doing so is in line with the actual situation in our country, is conducive to the development of the culture of all ethnic groups, and is conducive to the unification of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups.
Letter consistency not only helps mutual learning of ethnic languages, but also facilitates mutual absorption of new words. With the development of politics, economy, and culture of all ethnic groups, with the continuous emergence of new concepts, especially since liberation, Chinese vocabulary is being imported into the languages of various ethnic groups in batches, thus greatly enriching the languages of various ethnic groups and promoting their development and improvement. For example, words such as "Communist Party," "Chairman," "Premier," "factory," and "cooperative" in Chinese have become common components in the vocabularies of many ethnic groups today. The increasing number of these common components in the languages of all ethnic groups in the motherland is conducive to mutual learning and exchange among all ethnic groups.
Some people do not have a correct attitude towards handling new words and terms, and confuse some concepts with essential differences when translating, which is not good for the development of national culture and the cultural exchange of all ethnic groups.
However, in some ethnic groups, some people do not have a correct attitude towards handling new words and terms. The principle of using the original vocabulary of the ethnic language to construct new words is correct in itself; but some people, because they are afraid that borrowing words will seem to "harm" their own ethnic language, translate even what should not be translated, or use some words with another meaning to also express this new concept, calling it "giving old words new meanings," completely distorting the meaning of this new concept that is currently to be expressed, which is of course wrong. For example, a Tibetan newspaper translated the place name "Shanghai" into "the sea above" (Yarco) in its own language; a Jingpo document used the ethnic word Shanglot, which originally meant "independence," to translate "liberation," so the "liberation" of Shanghai and the "independence" of Ghana became the same word! Some people emphasize that borrowed words should first be absorbed from the languages of the same language family (even if it is a foreign nation), and then from Chinese; some people, such as our Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in translation work, are more interested in foreign language borrowed words than Chinese borrowed words. Some Chinese borrowed words have already been widely used by the masses, but they want to find some foreign borrowed words that the masses do not understand.
Last year, when I went to inspect the pastoral areas of Xinjiang, I invited some local teachers and cadres to have a discussion. They reflected that some of the new vocabulary used in the Xinjiang Daily were difficult for them to understand. For example, in this NPC document, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report had the word "accident," and the Uighur translation used a foreign borrowed word Avaria (which comes from Italian). I asked several representatives, and they all said they didn't understand.
This practice is not good for the development of national culture and the cultural exchange with domestic ethnic groups, and will only cause difficulties in understanding for the majority of people. Of course, we do not object to appropriately absorbing a certain number of internationally used words on the basis of general understanding by the masses. Everyone knows that if the various ethnic minorities in our country are to quickly join the ranks of advanced nations in terms of economy and culture, they must first learn and absorb the advanced culture, science, etc. of the main ethnic group of our motherland—the Han Chinese—and obtain their help. Therefore, when a new concept, noun, or term does not exist in the ethnic language but exists in the vocabulary of the common language of our motherland, why don't we absorb it to enrich our ethnic language? Adopting the vocabulary of the common language of our motherland is of great convenience for our various ethnic minorities to learn the advanced culture of the Han people and obtain their help, and is of great benefit to promoting the further integration of the cultures of all ethnic groups in our country and strengthening the unity and solidarity of all ethnic groups in our motherland.
In short, the formulation and implementation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is a part of the socialist construction of our motherland. It is not only a major and historically significant happy event in the cultural life of the Han people, but also a common great happy event for all ethnic groups in our country. The confirmation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is not only conducive to all ethnic groups learning Chinese, but also serves as a common foundation for the creation and reform of writing systems for ethnic minorities in our country. We warmly support the current Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme and hope that the congress will pass and approve it.

    我国各民族共同的大喜事
    包尔汉代表的发言
    汉语拼音方案的确定，不仅有利于各民族学习汉语汉文，同时也可用作我国少数民族创造和改革文字的共同基础。
    我完全同意并热烈拥护李先念、薄一波两位副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任所作的几个报告。
    现在我单就汉语拼音方案说几句话。
    汉语拼音方案是各族人民互相学习和沟通文化的有利工具。少数民族能够更便利地通过学习汉语汉文，得到汉族人民的帮助。
    当我们胜利的完成了第一个五个计划并满怀信心的进行第二个五年计划的时候，为了适应社会主义经济建设的大跃进要求，我们的文化教育事业以同样的速度积极发展，一同前进。要求更快地在全国范围扫除文盲，普及教育；要求大力推广普通话，使汉语更趋于统一，以便更好地为社会主义建设服务；同时它还要求各民族能打破语言上的隔阂，更亲密地团结在一起，加快步伐，在社会主义的道路上共同发展，共同繁荣。汉语拼音方案正是为满足以上要求所不可缺少的工具。
    汉语拼音方案采用拉丁字母是非常正确的。拉丁字母笔划简单，匀称优美，构形明确，便于认写，是世界上使用最广的一种字母系统，现在世界上有六十多个国家六亿以上的人口已采用了拉丁字母的文字。事实证明，对于拼写各种不同类型的各民族语言，它确实是具有高度的适应性的。我们用它来拼写汉语和其他民族的语言，能够使它充分反映各族语言的特点，这实际就是国际化的字母形式，民族化的具体运用。
    正如吴玉章同志在报告里所说的：“这个草案是经过专家长期研究、各方反复讨论和多次修订的，它确实反映了参加讨论的大多数人的意见。”这个方案具备很多的优点，它的确是一个比较成熟、完善的方案，希望这个方案经过大会讨论批准之后，能很快地在各地大力推行。
    八年来，通过种种的具体事实，各族人民深深地体会到，少数民族的幸福离不开党的领导，离不开各民族的友爱团结，离不开伟大汉族人民兄弟般的帮助。占全国总人口百分之九十四的汉族，由于历史的原因，在经济、文化、科学、技术等方面是走在前面的。各少数民族为了更快的摆脱落后状态，发展为先进的民族，共同地建设社会主义，就必须通过学习汉语汉文来学习汉族先进的文化、科学、哲学和经济生产等。过去长期以来，我们少数民族为了学习汉语汉文，从汉族的先进文化中吸取滋养，曾经作了很大的努力。但是难读、难认、难记、难写的汉字实在是各族人民学习汉语途径上不易逾越的难关！现在有了这个拼音方案来为汉字注音，作为帮助识字、统一读音、推广普通话的有利工具，作为各族人民之间互相学习和沟通文化的有利工具，可以预料：今后我国人民文化的提高，必然将以一种空前未有的速度向前跃进。
    少数民族学习汉语汉文，同发展自己的语言，不是互相矛盾和互相排斥，而是互相联系和互相推动。
    少数民族学习汉语汉文和各民族根据必要与可能来发展自己的语言文字，不是互相矛盾、互相排斥的，而是互相联系，互相推动的。这就是说：在祖国平等友爱团结合作的大家庭中，作为这个家庭成员的享有平等权利的兄弟民族，在发展和使用自己本民族的语言的同时，有一个各民族间互相交际的共同语言，并不意味着本族语言作用的消退和减弱，相反的，这只会更有利于彼此的交往，更有利于民族的繁荣和语言的丰富与发展。事实上汉语已经成为我国各民族的第二母语。高度发展的丰富优美的汉语曾经是并且还将是丰富各民族语言的取之不尽的源泉。另一方面，少数民族掌握了自己民族的语言文字，也可以通过参照对比，更快更有效地学习汉语汉文。
    中华人民共和国成立几年以来，党和人民政府为帮助各民族发展自己的语言文字作了巨大的努力。从一九五○年开始，中国科学院相继派遣语言学家和民族语文工作者到各少数民族地区调查研究各民族的语言，现在已经为十六个民族设计了二十一种文字方案。文字问题尚未解决的民族，正在研究解决的办法。对已有文字的民族正在继续研究改革的方案。在研究解决这些问题的时候，大家都深深感觉到为了避免各民族文字字母的不一致，造成日后相互学习交流的混淆和困难，各民族文字字母形式应当尽量汇通一致。为此，一九五六年十月曾举行过一次“民族文字字母形式讨论会”，到会的代表一致认为：“为了便于学习汉族的先进文化和便于各民族的文化交流，各个以拉丁字母为基础的少数民族文字，应在字母形式上尽可能和汉语拼音方案取得一致，即以相同的字母来表达相同、相近或有对应关系的语音”。这充分地反映了各少数民族人民共同的愿望。去年十月，中国文字改革委员会在讨论僮文方案的同时，就少数民族文字方案中设计字母的几项原则进行了研究，认为少数民族创制文字应该以拉丁字母为基础；原有文字进行改革，采用新的字母系统的时候，也应该尽可能以拉丁字母为基础。关于字母和语音的关系，则认为少数民族语言和汉语相同或者相近的音，应该尽可能用汉语拼音方案里相当的字母来表示。
    大家认为，各民族的文字，特别是语言关系密切的文字，在字母形式和拼写规则上应尽量取得一致。这样做，是符合我国实际情况，有利于各民族文化的发展，有利于祖国的统一和各民族的团结的。
    字母一致不只有助于各民族语文的互相学习，也便于新词的互相吸收。随着各民族政治、经济、文化的发展，随着新概念的不断涌现，特别是解放以来，汉语的词汇正在成批的输入到各个民族语言里去，因而大大丰富了各民族的语言，促进了它们的发展和提高。例如汉语里的“共产党”、“主席”、“总理”、“工厂”、“合作社”等词，今天已经成为许多民族词汇中的共同成分。祖国各民族语言中这些共同成分的日益增加，有利于各民族的互相学习交流。
    有些人对处理新词术语态度不够正确，翻译时把一些有本质差别的概念混淆起来，这样对本民族文化的发展和各民族文化交流没有好处。
    可是，在某些民族当中，有些人对处理新词术语的态度是不够正确的。运用本民族语言原有的词汇来构造新词，这个原则本来是正确的；但是有些人因为怕借词似乎会“损害”自己的民族语言，把不该译的也译了，或是利用一些另一含义的语词，来兼作表达这一新概念之用，称为“旧词赋以新义”，把一些有本质差别的概念混淆起来，完全歪曲了当前所要表达的这个新概念的意思，那当然是错误的。比如，有一份藏文报纸，把“上海”这个地名也用本民族的语言译成“上面的海”（Yarco）了；有一份景颇文的材料，用本义为“独立”的本民族语词Shanglot来译“解放”，于是上海的“解放”和加纳的“独立”成了同一个词了！有的人强调借词要先从同语族的语言（哪怕是国外的民族）吸收，然后才是汉语；有的人，例如我们新疆维吾尔自治区在翻译工作上，则对外国语的借词比汉语借词感到更大的兴趣。有一些汉语借词，群众口里已经普遍地使用了，他们却要另找一些群众所不了解的外来语借词。
    去年我去新疆牧区视察，曾邀集当地一些教员、干部座谈。他们反映：新疆日报所用的一些新词汇他们很难了解。比方这次人大文件中，薄一波副总理的报告里有“事故”这个词，维文翻译用了一个外来语借词Avaria（是来自意大利语），我问了好几位代表，都说不懂。
    这种作法对本民族文化的发展和与国内各民族的文化交流是没有好处的，只会造成多数人理解上的困难。当然我们并不反对在群众都已了解的基础上适当地吸收一定数量的国际通用的语词。大家知道我们国内各少数民族要在经济文化上很快地侪于先进民族，首先要学习和吸收我们祖国的主体民族——汉语的先进的文化、科学等并取得他们的帮助。因此，当一个新的概念、名词术语在本民族无有而在我们祖国共同语言词汇里有的时候，我们为什么不吸收它来丰富我们的民族语言呢？采用我们祖国共同语言的词汇，这对我们各少数民族学习汉族先进文化并取得他们的帮助是有很大便利的，并对促使我国各民族的文化进一步地融合贯通和加强我们祖国各民族的统一和团结是有很大好处的。
    总之，汉语拼音方案的制定和推行，是我们祖国社会主义建设的一部分，它不仅是汉族人民文化生活上的一件具有重大历史意义的大喜事，同时，它也是我国各民族共同的大喜事。汉语拼音方案的确定不仅有利各民族的学习汉语汉文，同时也可用作我国少数民族创造和改革文字的共同基础。我们热烈拥护现在的汉语拼音方案，希望大会予以通过批准。
