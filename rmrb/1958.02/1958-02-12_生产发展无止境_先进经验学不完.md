Production Development Has No End; Advanced Experience is Never Fully Learned
Representative Wu Xian says:
Zhejiang Province has complete confidence in achieving the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule: “800 jin” per mu of grain five years early, “100 jin of cotton” nine years early, and three pigs per household eight years early. Simultaneously, it has complete confidence in afforesting barren mountains and land five years early, eliminating common drought and flood disasters five years early, and eliminating the "four pests" five years early.

I completely agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

Our Zhejiang Province, like all parts of the country, is currently in a mass production leap forward centered on developing agriculture and advancing towards nature. This high tide has formed under the circumstances of the basic completion of the Three Great Transformations and the achievement of great victories on the political and ideological fronts through the Rectification Campaign and the Anti-Rightist Struggle. This high tide fully demonstrates the correctness of the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the greatness and infinity of the power and wisdom of the broad masses of working people. This high tide thoroughly shattered the "schadenfreude" dreams of all bourgeois rightists and the shameless slander of various defamations of the Communist Party and socialism. At the same time, it gave a profound lesson to those who were passively pessimistic, right-leaning, and promoted retreat.

The victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan has transformed Zhejiang Province from a grain-deficient province to a grain-surplus province. The grain output of more than 3 million mu in the province has reached 800 jin, and the total cotton output has doubled compared to 1952.

The high tide is first manifested in the fact that the people of the whole province have overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan for agricultural production with the greatest enthusiasm. In 1957, the grain output reached 16 billion jin, victoriously completing the task of the First Five-Year Plan, fundamentally changing the historical situation of Zhejiang's perennial grain shortage of about 1 billion jin. Zhejiang is no longer a grain-deficient province, and can now support the state with about 600 million jin each year. The total cotton output in 1957 has increased from 406,000 dan in 1952 to 885,000 dan, an increase of more than one-fold, overfulfilling 85% of the First Five-Year Plan. The number of live pigs reached 5.68 million, an increase of more than one-fold compared to 2.78 million in 1952, overfulfilling 17% of the First Five-Year Plan. Other products such as ramie, silkworm cocoons, and tea have also seen significant increases in production. During the First Five-Year Plan, many regions and agricultural cooperatives in the province have already experienced great leaps forward in agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics, the per-mu yield of grain has reached 800 jin on more than 3 million mu (one-tenth of the province's grain planting area), of which 260,000 mu has reached more than 1,000 jin. Huangyan and Wenling counties and the suburbs of Wenzhou have fully achieved "800 jin," and "1,000 jin townships," "1,000 jin cooperatives," and "1,000 jin teams" are even more common. The average yield of cotton fields in Cixi County, which accounts for nearly half of the province's cotton area, reached 105 jin on 540,000 mu. There are nearly 20,000 mu of ramie with a yield of 800 jin to 1,000 jin per mu, and more than 10,000 mu of sweet potatoes with a yield of more than 10,000 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 20,000 jin per mu. On the basis of production development, the lives of farmers in the province have been greatly improved. The superiority of cooperation has become an irrefutable fact.

Ten years depends on three years, three years depends on the first year, the first year depends on the present, the plan for the year is in winter; everyone shows their skills, every household has no idlers. The masses say: "Work hard for eighty days now, and be happy for ten thousand years in the future."

Under the education of the whole people's rectification movement initiated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and encouraged by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the province are now launching a mass winter production movement with water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and low-yield field transformation as the main contents, on the basis of the victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan. Judging from the current situation, this movement is advancing vigorously, riding the wind and waves, and forging ahead courageously with the force of a thousand horses galloping. The farmers said: "Ten years depends on three years, three years depends on the first year, the first year depends on the present, the plan for the year is in winter." By the end of January, the province's water conservancy construction movement had completed the planned 160 million cubic meters ahead of schedule, exceeding one and a half times the water conservancy upsurge of 1956. In the construction of water conservancy, many moving examples of "moving mountains to open rivers and diverting water over mountains" have emerged. Members of the Kuaile Cooperative in Xingfu Township, Huangyan County, moved a large stone weighing 8,000 jin onto the dam without modern tools. They said: "As long as the enthusiasm is high, the stones will also listen." Since Lanchi County conveyed the spirit of the Second Session of the Second Provincial Party Congress in mid-December, the water management movement has entered a new upsurge. The number of workers per day increased from 15,000 to 70,000, accounting for 65% to 70% of the county's labor force. In the evening, they lit 3,000 gasoline lamps, calcium carbide lamps, and countless lanterns, kerosene lamps, torches, and bonfires, and worked day and night to rush to repair water conservancy, forming a magnificent scene of "thousands of troops and horses during the day and brilliant lights all over the fields at night." Achieve water reservoirs in every township, water conservancy in every cooperative, all teams working, everyone showing their skills, and every household having no idlers. They said boldly: "Work during the day, work at night, and don't be afraid of difficulties in realizing the Forty Articles," "Work hard for eighty days now, and be happy for ten thousand years in the future." After the Zhuge Township in the county held a water conservancy oath-taking meeting attended by 2,300 people, more than 300 laborers from the Qingfeng Cooperative rushed to repair the Beitang Reservoir for ten consecutive days and nights. Cooperative member Zhuge Shanshan carried soil with his bare back for ten days and nights, carrying more than 200 jin per load, and the masses called him "Living Wu Song." The members of one cooperative in Majian Township excavated a 5-li long water diversion channel, which had to pass through a mountain range of six peaks. The cooperative members flattened the six peaks with the spirit of "passing five passes and beheading six generals." The members of the Aiguo Cooperative in Jiangshan County split the Longshan Ridge, broke through the cliffs, and built a canal over two mountains to divert water over the mountains. At the Yuxi Reservoir construction site in Ruian County, a total of 32 new types of tools were created in just seven days from January 11 to 18, setting off a mass technical reform upsurge, which increased labor efficiency by three times and greatly reduced labor intensity.

Gas lamps as the sun, stars as the moon, pond bottom as the battlefield, hoe as the knife and gun, fight a beautiful battle on the fertilizer accumulation front.

In the winter production movement, the revolutionary drive of the province's farmers reflected in fertilizer accumulation is also enormous. While carrying out large-scale water conservancy construction, Lanchi County saw a surge of fertilizer accumulators everywhere, from rural areas to towns, from plains to mountainous areas. They actively formulated plans, promptly summarized and promoted advanced experiences, and men, women, old, and young competed to be the first. Their slogan is "Gas lamps as the sun, stars as the moon, pond bottom as the battlefield, hoe as the knife and gun, fight a beautiful battle on the fertilizer accumulation front." From October to the end of December last year, in less than three months, the county had accumulated 23.5 million dan of various kinds of soil fertilizer. The Huangyi Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshan Township of the county implemented "Five Searches": "Search for pond mud in the pond, search for garbage in front and behind the house, search for grass mud on the edge of the field and roadside, search for dog feces on the edge of the grave and the intersection, search for sludge in the gutter and cave." The cooperative dug 350,000 dan of pond mud and 1,000 dan of grass mud in half a month. The members said: "In our cooperative, the ground, the bottom of the water, the edge of the field and the roadside, in front and behind the house, all over the mountains and fields, there is endless fertilizer to accumulate." At present, the province-wide fertilizer accumulation movement, which is as powerful as that in Lanchi County, is developing more and more vigorously.

"Low to high", "dry to paddy", "lean to fertile", "small to large, crooked to straight", "central field to riverbank field", the province will transform 10 million mu of low-yield fields into high-yield fields in two to three years through five "transformations".

While building water conservancy and vigorously carrying out fertilizer accumulation, the movement to transform low-yield fields is also being carried out enthusiastically in various regions of the province. The Jinhua Prefecture will transform 2 million mu of backward fields into high-yield fields this year. Shaoxing County has already transformed more than 45,000 mu of its 139,800 mu of low-yield fields. Shaoxing County also proposed "five transformations" measures to transform "central field to riverbank field," "low field to high field," "dry field to paddy field," "lean field to fertile field," and "small field to large field, crooked field to straight field." The total grain increase after the above five items are fully realized can reach 39.88 million jin, with an average increase of 307 jin per mu. In the movement to transform low-yield fields, the labor enthusiasm of the masses is also encouraging. They put forward the slogan "Not afraid of the cold, we will make great contributions on 800 jin." On January 17 alone, Shaoxing County had more than 54,000 male and female laborers involved in the "five transformations" movement. Many low-yield fields with poor water conservancy conditions have now achieved "ditches crisscrossing and drainage and irrigation being flexible." Under the situation of increasingly high enthusiasm of the masses, it is entirely possible to transform all of the province's approximately 10 million mu of red soil, rotten paddy fields, and central fields into high-yield fields in two to three years.

The high tide of agricultural production proves that constantly establishing and breaking the balance is the law of our career development.

The current high tide of agricultural production in Zhejiang Province, formed on the basis of the victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan, has not only created a good start for promoting a great leap forward in agricultural production in the province, but also enabled us to deeply understand the great significance of the teachings given to us by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

Practice has proved that "using the spirit of revolution, constantly destroying the old balance, establishing a new, advanced balance, and then destroying and establishing again, wave after wave, this is precisely the law of our career's advancement." In the process of constantly breaking through the balance and constantly establishing a new balance, the most fundamental key lies in our resolute overcoming of conservative thinking, always standing on the side of new things, and constantly giving new things strong support and encouragement. As mentioned above, Zhejiang, like other regions of the country, has an endless stream of advanced new things, so the imbalance between advanced and backward often exists. In the past five years, the total grain output of some counties has increased by 70%, while some counties have decreased by 20%; the highest per-mu yield is more than 2,000 jin, while the lowest is only more than 200 jin; the average yield of cotton in the province is 78 jin of lint cotton per mu, with the highest reaching more than 200 jin and the lowest only about 30 jin. Do we actively promote the development of advanced new things, even if they are small in the initial stage, to drive the backward to catch up with the advanced, so that the development of production reaches a new and higher level? Or do we fail to see new things, fail to see the great potential, fail to see the direction of effort, and be satisfied with the status quo, so that the advanced accommodates the backward? There is no doubt that doing everything possible to support and encourage the revolutionary drive of high-yield areas, actively promoting high-yield experiences, grasping the mainstream of advanced things, in order to make the backward catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become even more advanced, constantly establishing a new balance, and then further breaking this balance, is the only correct way to promote a great leap forward in agricultural production.

The work of promoting the double-wheeled double-share plow in Zhejiang also clearly shows the two completely different attitudes of people towards new things. Some people say that the double-wheeled double-share plow is terrible and is not suitable for the cultivation of paddy fields at all; some people say that the double-wheeled double-share plow is very good and warmly welcome it, calling it a "yield-increasing plow." The former took a negative attitude towards the new thing of the double-wheeled double-share plow and returned a large number of double-wheeled double-share plows to the supply and marketing cooperatives; the latter made every effort to do a good job in promotion, overcome difficulties in every possible way, taught farmers how to use them, and persisted. According to the results of the use of many agricultural cooperatives and state-owned farms throughout the province, it fully proves that the double-wheeled double-share plow is very good and not terrible. More than 50,000 mu of fields cultivated with double-wheeled double-share plows in Huangyan County generally increased production by 4.8% compared with using soil plows, with the highest increase being 33%. These facts give a strong blow to conservative thinking. Under the care and support of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Zhejiang Province is conducting a debate on the double-wheeled double-share plow, which has become a living textbook for鞭策 us to break conservative thinking.

Righting the political direction and understanding the ideology, as long as we overcome conservatism, we can exert endless power.

The development of the high tide of agricultural production also vividly points out the great role of human factors and political factors, enabling us to further recognize the great significance of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's repeated teachings to us to resolutely take the mass line. The experience of the rectification movement tells us that mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses should focus on the agricultural development program and adopt the methods of "what to do", "what to release", "what to debate" and "what to change" to achieve both correcting the political direction and understanding the ideology. When Qingtiang County studied and deployed water conservancy work last autumn, some cadres and masses had conservative ideas such as "there is no good water conservancy to be built in mountainous areas" and "water conservancy cannot be done without the state providing money." The county leaders organized cadres to study the relevant instructions on water management, and also organized a special debate on "who to rely on to build water conservancy" at the county's water conservancy representatives' meeting attended by more than 10,000 people, organizing cadres and the masses to visit reservoirs that relied on the masses' own efforts to build water conservancy and obtain a bumper harvest. Through debate and visits, the awareness of cadres and the masses was improved, and the members further discussed the water conservancy plan. Except for a larger reservoir that needed a subsidy of 20,000 yuan from the state, the original more than 200,000 yuan that the state had to invest in were all solved by the beneficiary cooperatives themselves.

Rely on the state to run large-scale water conservancy? Or rely on the masses to run small-scale water conservancy? This question was also solved through the practice of the masses. In the early days of liberation, Tongshan Township, Zhuji County, had a drought resistance capacity of only about 20 days for farmland, with an average yield of only 380 jin per mu. However, after mobilizing the masses and adopting the method of planting gourds on long vines to build 18 small reservoirs, 15 mountain ponds, and 1,310 other small water conservancy projects, the average drought resistance capacity of farmland in the township increased to 51 days, and the unit area yield in 1956 exceeded 800 jin. It can be seen from this that as long as we adhere to the mass line and fully recognize the great role of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people under the new socialist relations of production, it is entirely possible for the province to build 200,000 small reservoirs during the Second Five-Year Plan with just water conservancy construction alone.

Linhai can't compare with Xiaogan, Xiaoshan can't compare with Meng County, which shows that production is endless and advanced experience is never fully learned.

Chairman Mao instructed us that "modesty makes one progress, and pride makes one lag behind," which is a guide for all work. In the process of agricultural production development, many facts have proved that any region that has once been advanced and has produced a complacent idea of reaching the top of production will inevitably be quickly abandoned to the rear by more advanced regions. Advanced regions can only constantly maintain their advanced status by humbly learning from the experience of other advanced regions and improving the shortcomings in their work. The backward must learn from the advanced, and the advanced must learn from the more advanced. The highest per-mu yield of three-crop land in the Huayuan Cooperative in Linhai County of our province is 2,121 jin, which is considered the highest in Zhejiang, but the highest single-season late rice in Xiaogan, Hubei, is 2,023 jin; the highest wheat in our province is 363 jin per mu produced by the Chudong Cooperative in Xiaoshan County, while the highest in Meng County, Henan, is 1,000 jin; the highest cotton in our province is 606 jin of seed cotton, while the highest seed cotton yield in Macheng County, Hubei, has exceeded 1,000 jin. All of this proves that the potential of agricultural production is endless, the development of production will never reach the top, advanced experience will never be fully learned, and any complacency and conservatism are wrong.

Under the revolutionary new situation of the victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan and the current enthusiastic winter production upsurge of farmers throughout the province, 34 of the province's more than 70 counties have formulated plans to achieve "800 jin" in 1958, of which three counties and cities will achieve "1,000 jin." Therefore, we have full confidence in achieving the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule: "800 jin" per mu of grain five years early, "100 jin of cotton" nine years early, and three pigs per household eight years early, afforesting barren mountains and land five years early, eliminating common drought and flood disasters five years early, and eliminating the "four pests" five years early.

We will encounter difficulties in our advance, but as long as we resolutely implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, as long as we have the determination to overcome nature, no difficulty can shake our strong will. The working people under the leadership of the Communist Party are moving from victory to greater victory with revolutionary heroic spirit and the ambition to strive for the top.

    生产发展无止境　先进经验学不完
    吴宪代表说
    浙江省完全有信心提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的粮食亩产“八百斤”、提前九年实现“百斤棉”、提前八年实现每户养三头猪的指标，同时完全有信心提前五年绿化荒山、荒地，提前五年消灭普通水旱灾害，提前五年消灭“四害”
    我完全同意李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理和吴玉章主任所作的报告。
    我们浙江省和全国各地一样，目前正处在一个以发展农业为中心的向自然进军的群众性生产大跃进的高潮中。这个高潮是在三大改造已经基本完成，通过整风反右派斗争，在政治战线上和思想战线上取得了伟大胜利的形势下形成的。这个高潮充分证明了党中央和毛主席领导的正确和广大劳动人民群众力量与智慧的伟大和无穷。这一高潮彻底粉碎了一切资产阶级右派分子“幸灾乐祸”的迷梦和各种污蔑共产党和社会主义的无耻谰言，同时也给予那些消极悲观、右倾保守的促退派一个深刻的教训。
    第一个五年计划的胜利完成，已使浙江省从缺粮省变成余粮省。全省已有三百多万亩的粮食产量达到八百斤，棉花总产量较1952年提高一倍。
    高潮首先表现在全省人民以最大的积极性超额完成了农业生产的第一个五年计划。一九五七年，粮食产量已达到一百六十亿斤，胜利完成了第一个五年计划的任务，根本改变了浙江在历史上常年缺粮十亿斤左右的情况。浙江现在再也不是缺粮省了，而且每年还能支援国家六亿斤左右。一九五七年的棉花总产量，已由一九五二年四十万六千担提高到八十八万五千担，增长一倍以上，超额完成了第一个五年计划的百分之八十五。生猪达到五百六十八万头，比一九五二年二百七十八万头增加一倍以上，超额完成了第一个五年计划的百分之十七。其他如络麻、蚕茧、茶叶等也都有了显著的增产。第一个五年计划期间，全省有许多地区，许多农业社已经出现了农业生产的大跃进。据不完全统计，全省已有三百多万亩（占全省粮食种植面积十分之一）粮食的每亩产量达到八百斤，其中有二十六万亩达到一千斤以上，黄岩、温岭两县和温州市郊区全面实现了“八百斤”，千斤乡、千斤社、千斤队更为普遍。占全省棉花面积将近一半的慈溪县五十四万亩棉田平均产量达到一百零五斤。络麻亩产八百斤到一千斤的将近二万亩，蕃薯亩产万斤以上的有一万多亩，最高的达到亩产二万斤。在生产发展的基础上，全省农民的生活有了很大程度的改善。合作化的优越性已经成为驳不倒的事实。
    十年看三年，三年看头年，头年看目前，一年之计在冬天；人人显身手，户户无闲人，群众说：“现在辛苦八十天，将来幸福万万年”。
    全省人民在党中央和毛主席倡导的全民整风运动的教育下，在党中央和毛主席提出的全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的鼓舞下，现在正在第一个五年计划胜利的基础上掀起了一个以兴修水利、开展积肥和改造低产田为主要内容的群众性的冬季生产运动。照目前情况看来，这个运动正以万马奔腾之势，乘风破浪，奋勇前进。农民们说：“十年看三年，三年看头年，头年看目前，一年之计在冬天”。全省兴修水利运动，到一月底止，已经提前完成了一亿六千公方的计划，超过一九五六年水利高潮的一倍半。在兴修水利中，出现了许多“移山开河、引水过山”的动人事例。黄岩县幸福乡快乐社的社员们，在缺乏现代工具的条件下，把一块八千斤重的大石头搬上大坝，他们说：“只要劲头大，石头也听话”。兰溪县自从十二月中旬传达省二届二次党代会的精神以后，治水运动进入一个新的高潮，每日上工人数由一万五千增加到七万人，占全县劳动力的百分之六十五至七十。一到晚上，他们点着三千盏汽灯、电石灯和无数的灯笼、煤油灯、火把、火堆，夜以继日地赶修水利，形成一个“白天千军万马，晚上遍野灯火辉煌”的轰轰烈烈的场面。做到乡乡建水库，社社修水利，队队都出工，人人显身手，户户无闲人。他们豪迈地说：“白天干，夜里干，实现四十条不怕难”，“现在辛苦八十天，将来幸福万万年”。该县诸葛乡召开二千三百人的水利誓师大会后，庆丰社三百多个劳动力，连续十天十夜抢修北塘水库。社员诸葛珊珊十天十夜赤膊挑土，每担都挑二百斤以上，群众称之为“活武松”。马涧乡一社的社员开挖一条五华里长的引水渠道，要通过一条山岭六个山头，社员们以“过五关，斩六将”的精神把六个山头削平。江山县爱国社的社员劈开龙山岗，打通悬崖绝壁，越过二个山头修成渠道，翻水过山。瑞安县愚溪水库工地，在一月十一日到十八日短短的七天内，合计创造新式工具三十二种，掀起了群众性的技术改革高潮，劳动效率提高了三倍，大大降低了劳动强度。
    汽灯当太阳，星星当月亮，塘底当战场，锄头当刀枪，在积肥战线上打一个漂亮仗。
    冬季生产运动中，反映在积肥方面的全省农民的革命干劲也是十分巨大的。兰溪县在大规模兴修水利的同时，从农村到城镇，从平原到山区，到处涌现了积肥的人群。他们积极订出规划，及时总结和推广先进经验，男女老幼互相争先。他们提出的口号是“汽灯当太阳，星星当月亮，塘底当战场，锄头当刀枪，在积肥战线上打一个漂亮仗”。全县从去年十月到十二月底，不到三个月的功夫，已经积好各类土肥二千三百五十万担。该县岩山乡黄溢农业社实行“五找”：“向塘里找塘泥，向屋前屋后找垃圾，向田边路旁找草泥，向坟边路口找狗粪，向阴沟洞里找污泥”、全社在半个月内，就挖了塘泥三十五万担，削草泥一千担。社员说：“我们社里，地面水底，田边路旁，屋前屋后，满山遍野，到处都是积不尽的肥料”。目前全省各地声势浩大的积肥运动，正像兰溪县一样，越来越有劲头的开展起来。
    “低改高”，“旱改水”，“瘦改肥”，“小改大、歪改直”，“垟心改河沿”，全省通过五“改”要在两三年内把一千万亩低产田改为高产田。
    在兴修水利、大力开展积肥的同时，改造低产田运动，目前也在全省各个地区热火朝天地进行。金华专区二百万亩落后田，要在今年全部改成高产田。绍兴县十三万九千八百亩低产田，现在已改好四万五千多亩。绍兴县并提出“五改”措施，要把“垟心田改河沿田”，“低田改高田”，“旱田改水田”，“瘦田改肥田”，“小田改大田、歪田改直田”。以上五项全部实现，共可增产粮食三千九百八十八万斤，平均每亩可增产三百零七斤。在改造低产田运动中，群众的劳动热情也是鼓舞人心的，他们提出：“不怕天寒地冻，要在八百斤上立大功”的口号。绍兴县仅在一月十七日这一天，全县就有五万四千多男女劳动力投入“五改”运动。许多水利条件很差的低产田，现在已经做到了“沟渠纵横，排灌灵便”。在群众的干劲日益提高的形势下，在二年至三年时间内把全省一千万亩左右的红壤土、烂水田、垟心田全部改成为高产田是完全有可能的。
    农业生产高潮证明，不断建立和打破平衡，是我们事业发展的规律。
    在第一个五年计划胜利完成基础上所形成的浙江省当前农业生产高潮，不仅为促进全省农业生产大跃进创造了良好的开端，而且使我们深刻地体会到党中央和毛主席给予我们的教导的伟大意义。
    实践证明：“用革命的精神，不断破坏旧平衡，建立新的、先进的平衡，然后又破坏又建立，一浪赶一浪，这正是我们事业的前进的规律”。而在不断突破平衡、不断建立新的平衡的过程中，最基本的关键在于我们坚决克服保守思想，永远站在新生事物这一边，不断给予新生事物以有力的支持和鼓励。如前所述，浙江和全国其他地区一样，先进的新生事物是层出不穷的，因而先进和落后的不平衡状态经常存在着。五年来，我们有的县粮食总产量增长百分之七十，有的县反而减产百分之二十；有的最高亩产二千多斤，有的低到只有二百多斤；棉花全省平均每亩产皮棉七十八斤，高的达到二百多斤，低的只有三十斤左右。我们是积极地助长先进的那怕在初期是微小的新生事物的发展，来带动落后赶上先进，使生产的发展达到新的更高的水平呢？还是看不到新鲜事物，看不到巨大的潜力，看不到努力的方向，满足于现状，使先进迁就落后呢？毫无疑义，千方百计地支持和鼓励高产量地区的革命干劲，积极推广高产经验，抓住先进事物的主流，以求得落后赶上先进，先进更加先进，不断建立新的平衡，又进一步打破这个平衡，才是促进农业生产大跃进的唯一正确的办法。
    从浙江推广双轮双铧犁的工作来看，也明显地表现出人们对新鲜事物的两种截然不同的态度。一种人说双轮双铧犁糟得很，根本不适宜水稻田的耕作；一种人说双轮双铧犁好得很，热烈地欢迎它，称之为“增产犁”。前一种人对双轮双铧犁这一新生事物采取了否定的态度，把大批的双轮双铧犁退回给供销合作社；后一种人则全力做好推广工作，千方百计克服困难，教会农民使用起来，坚持下去。根据全省各地许多农业社和国营农场使用的结果来看，完全证明了双轮双铧犁是好得很而不是糟得很。黄岩县五万多亩用双轮双铧犁耕的田，一般比用土犁增产百分之四点八，最高的增产百分之三十三。这些事实给予保守思想以一个有力的打击。在党中央和毛主席的关怀、支持下，浙江全省正在进行一次关于双轮双铧犁的辩论，它已经成为鞭策我们打破保守思想的一个活的教材。
    一面端正政治方向，一面弄通思想，只要克服了保守就能发挥无尽力量。
    农业生产高潮的发展，还生动地向我们指出人的因素和政治因素的伟大作用，使我们进一步认识到党中央和毛主席一再教导我们坚决走群众路线的重大意义。整风运动的经验告诉我们，发动群众、依靠群众，应当围绕着农业发展纲要，采取“做什么”、“放什么”、“辩什么”、“改什么”的方法，达到既能端正政治方向，又能弄通思想。青田县去年秋天研究布置水利工作时，部分干部、群众存在着“山区无水利好修”、“国家不出钱，水利办不成”的保守思想。县领导上组织干部学习有关治水的指示，还在全县一万余人参加的各级水利代表会上，组织“依靠谁来修水利”的专题辩论，组织干部、群众参观依靠群众自己力量兴修水利而获得丰收的水库。通过辩论和参观，干部和群众的觉悟提高了，社员们进一步讨论了水利规划，全县除了一个较大的水库需由国家补助二万元外，原来要国家投资的二十多万元，全部都由受益社自筹解决。
    依靠国家办大型水利？还是依靠群众办小型水利？这个问题也是通过群众的实践解决了。诸暨县同山乡解放初期，农田抗旱能力只有二十天左右，平均亩产只有三百八十斤。但从发动群众，采取长藤结瓜法兴修了十八个小型水库、十五个山塘和一千三百一十处其他小型水利以后，全乡农田平均抗旱能力提高到五十一天，一九五六年的单位面积产量就超过了八百斤。由此可见，只要我们坚持走群众路线，充分认识劳动人民在新的社会主义生产关系下的革命积极性的伟大作用，就以兴修水利一项，第二个五年计划期间全省修建二十万个小型水库是完全能够实现的。
    临海比不过孝感，萧山比不过孟县，说明生产无止境，先进经验学不完。
    毛主席指示我们，“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，这句话是一切工作的指南。在农业生产发展的过程中，许多事实证明，凡是由于一度先进而产生生产到顶的自满思想的地区，必然很快地被更先进的地区抛弃到后面去。先进的地区，只有不断地虚心学习其他先进地区的经验，改进自己工作中的缺点，才能不断地保持先进。落后要向先进的学习，先进的要向更先进的学习。本省临海县花园社的三熟地最高亩产粮食二千一百二十一斤，在浙江算是最高的了，但是湖北孝感的单季晚稻最高的就有二千零二十三斤；本省小麦最高的是萧山县褚东社亩产三百六十三斤，而河南孟县最高达一千斤；本省棉花最高的为籽棉六百零六斤，而湖北麻城县最高的籽棉产量已超过了一千斤。这一切都证明农业生产的潜力是无穷尽的，生产的发展永远不会到顶，先进的经验永远学不完，任何自满保守都是错误的。
    在第一个五年计划的胜利完成，和当前全省农民热火朝天的冬季生产高潮的革命的新形势下，全省七十多个县，已经有三十四个县订出在一九五八年实现“八百斤”的规划，其中三个县、市将实现“一千斤”。因此，我们完全有信心提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的粮食亩产“八百斤”，提前九年实现“百斤棉”，提前八年实现每户养三头猪，提前五年绿化荒山、荒地，提前五年消灭普通水旱灾害，提前五年消灭“四害”。
    在前进中是会遇到困难的，只要我们坚决贯彻党中央和毛主席的指示，只要我们有战胜自然的决心，任何困难都动摇不了我们的坚强意志。在共产党领导下的劳动人民，正以革命的英雄气概和力争上游的志气，从胜利走向更大的胜利。
