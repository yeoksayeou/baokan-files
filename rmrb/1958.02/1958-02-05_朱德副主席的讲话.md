Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades:

　　Today marks the tenth anniversary of our friendly neighbor Ceylon's independence, and it is also the first time Ceylon has held an Independence Day celebration in our country. I am very pleased and excited to have the opportunity to attend the reception of the Chargé d'Affaires of Ceylon. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I extend warm congratulations to the government and people of Ceylon. We are very grateful to the Chargé d'Affaires for reading the telegram from Prime Minister Bandaranaike just now, and we fully share the friendly wishes he expressed in the telegram.

　　Ten years ago today, the people of Ceylon, after centuries of hard struggle, finally gained their independence and freedom. In the past ten years, the people of Ceylon have made many efforts to maintain independence and build their own country. The Chinese people are delighted with every achievement made by the people of Ceylon in the process of independent development. Ceylon, China, and other newly independent Asian and African countries, in order to build their own countries and develop their economies and cultures, need to make great efforts themselves, and also need to unite closely with each other, strengthen cooperation, support each other, and learn from each other. In this regard, China and Ceylon have set a good example. When our country was in difficulty, Ceylon bravely broke through the blockade and embargo of Western countries and carried out equal and mutually beneficial trade with our country. The Chinese people sincerely thank Ceylon for this friendly gesture. Recently, Ceylon has suffered from severe floods, and the Chinese people deeply sympathize with and care about this. We believe that the government and people of Ceylon will be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties through their own efforts and with the help of friendly countries.

　　We are pleased to see that Ceylon, as one of the initiators of the Asian-African Conference, is playing an increasingly important role internationally. In the past ten years, especially in recent years, Ceylon has made beneficial contributions to opposing war, opposing military blocs, and maintaining world peace, promoting peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, opposing colonialism, and safeguarding the independence of Asian and African countries. The Government of Ceylon and Prime Minister Bandaranaike have expressed concern and a positive attitude towards the most urgent major international issues, such as the holding of summit meetings, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and disarmament. The Chinese government and people fully support this peaceful policy of the Ceylon government. Thanks to the joint efforts of all peace-loving countries and people in the world, a new situation conducive to peace has emerged in the current international situation. Recently, various proposals put forward by peace-loving countries such as the Soviet Union, India, and Poland, aimed at further easing international tensions and eliminating all threats of war, have been warmly supported by the people of the world. Peaceful coexistence has become the general trend and the aspiration of the people today. Under such favorable circumstances, all peace-loving countries and people must make persistent efforts and continue to strive to further ease the international situation. The Chinese people are willing to work with the people of Ceylon to contribute their strength to world peace and human happiness.

　　China and Ceylon have a deep traditional friendship since ancient times. The past year, as the Chargé d'Affaires said, has been a year of particular significance in the history of our two countries' relations. Our Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long visited Ceylon a year ago, and the warm welcome and reception given to them by the Ceylon government and people was unforgettable. The joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of China and Ceylon jointly affirmed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, thus providing a solid foundation for the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. Now we have not only established formal diplomatic relations, but we also signed new trade agreements and economic aid agreements last year, and various cultural and friendly exchanges between us are becoming more and more frequent. It is particularly necessary to mention that Prime Minister Bandaranaike has accepted the invitation of our government and will visit our country. The Chinese government and people are eagerly looking forward to the visit of our distinguished guests. I firmly believe that in the new year, the close friendly and cooperative relations already existing between China and Ceylon will have a broader development.

　　I propose a toast:
　　To the increasing consolidation and development of friendship between China and Ceylon!
　　To the prosperity and happiness of Ceylon!
　　To the peace of Asia, Africa and the world!
　　To the victory of the Five Principles!
　　To the health of Governor Goonetilleke!
　　Cheers!

### 朱德副主席的讲话

　　朱德副主席的讲话代办先生，女士们，先生们，同志们：
    今天是我们的友邦锡兰获得独立的十周年，也是锡兰在我国第一次举行的独立日庆祝。我和大家能有机会参加锡兰代办先生的招待会感到十分愉快和兴奋。我谨代表中国政府和人民向锡兰政府和人民致以热烈的祝贺。我们十分感谢代办先生刚才宣读的班达拉奈克总理阁下给我们的电文，我们对他在电文中表示的友好愿望完全抱有同感。
    十年前的今天，锡兰人民经过了几个世纪的努力奋斗，终于获得了自己的独立和自由。十年来锡兰人民在维护独立和建设自己的国家方面进行了许多努力。中国人民对锡兰人民在独立发展的进程中所取得的每一项成就感到高兴。锡兰、中国以及其他独立不久的亚非国家为了建设自己的国家，发展本国的经济和文化，除了本身须做重大的努力以外，还需要彼此紧密团结、加强合作、互相支持、互相学习。在这方面，中锡两国曾经作出了良好的榜样。在我国困难的时候，锡兰曾经勇敢地冲破了西方国家的封锁禁运，同我国进行了平等互利的贸易，中国人民衷心感谢锡兰的这种友好举动。最近锡兰发生严重的水灾，中国人民对此寄予深切的同情和关怀。我们相信锡兰政府和人民经过自己的努力和各友好国家的帮助一定能够战胜种种困难的。
    我们高兴地看到，锡兰作为亚非会议发起国之一，在国际上正起着日益重要的作用。十年来，尤其是最近几年来锡兰对于反对战争、反对军事集团和维护世界和平，促进各国人民的和平共处和友好合作，反对殖民主义和维护亚非国家的独立，作出了有益的贡献。锡兰政府和班达拉奈克总理对于当前最迫切的重大国际问题，如召开最高级会议，禁止核武器、裁减军备等，都表示了关怀和积极的态度。我国政府和人民充分支持锡兰政府的这种和平政策。由于全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力，当前的国际形势出现了新的有利于和平的局面。最近苏联、印度、波兰等爱好和平的国家提出的旨在进一步缓和国际局势，消除一切战争威胁的各项建议受到了全世界人民的热烈拥护。和平共处已经成为今天的大势所趋、人心所向。在这样有利的情况下，所有爱好和平的国家和人民更加须要再接再厉，继续努力来促使国际局势进一步和缓。中国人民愿意同锡兰人民一起，为世界的和平和人类的幸福，而贡献出自己的力量。
    中锡两国自古以来就存在着深厚的传统友谊。过去的一年正如代办先生所说，是我们两国关系史上具有特别重要意义的一年。我国周恩来总理和贺龙副总理一年前访问了锡兰，锡兰政府和人民所给予他们的热情欢迎和接待是令人难忘的。中锡两国总理发表的联合声明共同肯定了和平共处的五项原则，这样就为我们两国之间的友好合作关系的进一步发展提供了巩固的基础。现在我们不仅已经建立了正式的外交关系，我们在去年还签订了新的贸易协定，和经济援助协定，我们之间的各种文化友好往来也日益频繁，特别需要提到的是班达拉奈克总理已经接受我国政府的邀请，将要来我国访问，中国政府和人民热切地盼望我们尊贵的客人的光临。我深信，在新的一年中，中锡两国之间已存在的亲切的友好合作关系将会有更加广阔的发展。
    我提议：
    为中锡两国友谊的日益巩固和发展，
    为锡兰的繁荣和幸福，
    为亚非和世界的和平，
    为五项原则的胜利，
    为古?狄莱克总督阁下的健康，
    干杯！
