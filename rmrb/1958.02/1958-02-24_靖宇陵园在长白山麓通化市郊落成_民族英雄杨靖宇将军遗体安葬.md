Xinhua News Agency, Tonghua, February 23rd: The remains of the great national hero and outstanding communist fighter, General Yang Jingyu, former commander-in-chief of the First Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, were interred today in the newly completed Jingyu Mausoleum in the suburbs of Tonghua City at the foot of Changbai Mountain in Jilin Province. A public memorial ceremony was held before the burial.

Today marks the eighteenth anniversary of General Yang Jingyu's martyrdom. In those years, the anti-Japanese base areas in Northeast China's Changbai Mountain region were covered in white snow. Representatives of the masses from the former anti-Japanese base areas in Northeast China, leaders of the former Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, and the family members of General Yang Jingyu arrived at the newly completed Jingyu Mausoleum on the east bank of the Hun River with heavy hearts. More than 9,000 soldiers and people from Tonghua City also participated in the public memorial and burial ceremony.

A huge portrait of the martyr hung in front of General Yang Jingyu's mourning hall, with a large number of wreaths and elegiac couplets sent by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, various provinces and cities in Northeast China, and General Yang Jingyu's comrades-in-arms placed on both sides. There were wreaths from Party and state leaders Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai, as well as wreaths from leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Kim Il-sung, Choi Yong-kun, Kim Il, Kim Kwang-hyop, and Choi Hyun, which read "Dedicated to Comrade Yang Jingyu, the outstanding son of the Chinese people, ardent communist, and heroic anti-Japanese fighter."

The public memorial and burial ceremony began amidst mournful music. Kang Sheng, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, presented a wreath before General Yang Jingyu's spirit. Presiding officers Kang Sheng and Zhou Baozhong, Deng Hua, Feng Zhongyun, Wu De, Yu Tianfang, Gan Chongdou, Xing Zhaotang, Li Youwen, Zhang Xuexuan, Yi Junshan, He Jian, Liu Duquan, Yin Zuoxu, representatives of the former anti-Japanese base areas in Northeast China, and representatives of democratic parties and mass organizations in Northeast China, all stood in silence and paid their respects before General Yang Jingyu's spirit.

Feng Zhongyun, former political commissar of the Third Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, introduced General Yang Jingyu's life and deeds before the martyr's spirit. Then, Kang Sheng, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke. He said: The struggle of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army is a part of the Chinese people's liberation cause under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Today, as we commemorate Comrade Yang Jingyu, we are also commemorating all the revolutionary martyrs who gloriously sacrificed themselves in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war in Northeast China. Kang Sheng pointed out: In 1931, Japanese imperialists carried out armed occupation of Northeast China, and the Kuomintang government adopted a policy of non-resistance. Only the Communist Party of China stood on the front line of the anti-Japanese struggle. Comrade Yang Jingyu and other communists who led the anti-Japanese guerrilla war in the Northeast region, closely integrated with the people of all ethnic groups in Northeast China, shared weal and woe, and united all patriotic forces to form the Anti-Japanese United Army under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, launching a long and arduous struggle against the Japanese aggressors, giving the aggressors a powerful blow. Kang Sheng then emphasized: Many Korean comrades also participated in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war in the Northeast region at that time. In the common struggle, the Chinese and Korean people forged a deep friendship, which was further developed later in the common opposition to the aggression of American imperialism. Kang Sheng concluded: We must learn from Comrade Yang Jingyu's noble revolutionary qualities, and use indomitable revolutionary perseverance and a spirit of hard work to build our socialist motherland.

General Deng Hua, representative of the Ministry of National Defense, introduced the arduous struggle of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army and General Yang Jingyu in the heart of the enemy and puppet regime. He pointed out that General Yang Jingyu's heroic tenacity, arduous struggle, lifelong loyalty to the cause of the Party and the people, and ultimate sacrifice for the country are worthy examples for the entire army to learn from.

Subsequently, Li Youwen, Yu Tianfang, and Zhang Xuexuan, representatives from the three northeastern provinces, and Xing Zhaotang, representative from Henan Province, all spoke. Yu Tianfang and Yi Junshan, old comrades-in-arms of General Yang Jingyu in the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, recalled before the spirit the deeds of General Yang Jingyu and the soldiers of the Anti-Japanese United Army in those years when they held high the banner of anti-Japanese national salvation and fought in the Changbai Mountains and along the Yalu River. They pointed out that General Yang Jingyu and the soldiers of the Anti-Japanese United Army displayed a tenacious revolutionary spirit in the icy and snowy, hungry and cold environment, and sprinkled their blood and sweat all over the white mountains and black waters, leaving behind countless glorious and moving historical traces.

Ma Congyun, a family member of General Yang Jingyu, expressed gratitude in his speech for the care and concern of the Party and the government for the families of martyrs. He stated that he would inherit his father's legacy and resolutely fight to the end for the cause of socialist construction.

Finally, the burial ceremony was held. The presiding officers and accompanying representatives entered the mourning hall and circled the tomb once, bidding a final farewell to General Yang Jingyu. Kang Sheng and General Yang Jingyu's close comrades-in-arms Zhou Baozhong, Feng Zhongyun, Yu Tianfang, Yi Junshan, Wu De, and others sealed the tomb for the martyr's remains. The public memorial and burial ceremony concluded amidst the singing of the Internationale.

The day before the public memorial and burial ceremony, Kang Sheng, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, General Deng Hua, representative of the Ministry of National Defense, and others extended their cordial condolences to the family of Martyr Yang Jingyu. Li Seung-an, Consul of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Changchun, was invited to participate in today's ceremony and paid condolences to the family of General Yang Jingyu yesterday.

The remains of General Yang Jingyu were originally stored in the Northeast Martyrs Memorial Hall in Harbin. In order to permanently commemorate the anti-Japanese national hero who had fought in the area for many years, the people of the Changbai Mountain region began building a mausoleum for General Yang Jingyu in the suburbs of Tonghua City in 1954, and in September of last year, General Yang Jingyu's remains were moved from Harbin to Tonghua in preparation for burial.

    靖宇陵园在长白山麓通化市郊落成
    民族英雄杨靖宇将军遗体安葬
    新华社通化23日电　伟大的民族英雄、优秀的共产主义战士——前东北抗日联军第一路军总指挥杨靖宇将军的遗体，今天安葬在吉林省长白山麓通化市郊新落成的靖宇陵园里。在安葬以前，先举行了公祭仪式。
    今天是杨靖宇将军殉国十八周年纪念日。当年东北地区的抗日根据地长白山区复盖着一片白雪。原东北各抗日根据地的群众代表、原东北抗日联军的领导人和杨靖宇将军的家属怀着沉痛的心情来到了浑江东岸刚落成的靖宇陵园。参加公祭安葬仪式的还有通化市的驻军和人民九千多人。
    在杨靖宇将军的灵堂前悬挂着烈士的巨幅遗像，两旁安放着中共中央、国务院、东北各省、市以及杨靖宇将军生前战友送来的大批花圈和挽联。这里有党和国家领导人毛泽东、朱德、刘少奇、周恩来送的花圈，还有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领导人金日成、崔庸健、金一、金光侠、崔宪送来的花圈，上面写着“献给中国人民的优秀儿子、热烈的共产主义者，和英勇的抗日斗士——杨靖宇同志”。
    公祭安葬仪式在哀乐声中开始。中共中央代表康生在杨靖宇将军灵前敬献花圈。主祭人康生、周保中，邓华、冯仲云、吴德、于天放、甘重斗、邢肇棠、栗又文、张雪轩、伊俊山、贺健、刘督权、尹作序和原东北各抗日根据地代表以及东北各民主党派、群众团体的陪祭人都在杨靖宇将军灵前默哀致敬。
    前东北抗日联军第三路军政治委员冯仲云在烈士灵前介绍了杨靖宇将军的生平事迹。接着，中共中央代表康生讲了话。他说：东北抗日联军的斗争是在中国共产党领导下的中国人民解放事业中的一个部分。我们今天来纪念杨靖宇同志，也就是纪念在东北抗日游击战争中光荣牺牲了的一切革命先烈。康生指出：1931年日本帝国主义者对东北实行武装占领，国民党政府采取了不抵抗政策，只有中国共产党站在抗日斗争的最前线。杨靖宇同志和在东北地区领导抗日游击战争的其他共产党人，和东北各族人民紧密地结合在一起，同甘苦、共患难，并且团结了一切爱国力量，在党中央领导下组成了抗日联军，向日本侵略者进行了长期的艰苦斗争，给了侵略者以有力的打击。康生接着强调指出：参加当时东北地区抗日游击战争的还有许多朝鲜同志。在共同的斗争中，中国人民和朝鲜人民结成了深厚的友谊，这种友谊后来又在共同反对美帝国主义的侵略中得到了进一步的发展。康生最后说：我们要学习杨靖宇同志崇高的革命品质，用无坚不摧的革命毅力和刻苦奋斗的精神来建设社会主义祖国。
    国防部代表邓华上将介绍了东北抗日联军和杨靖宇将军在敌伪统治的心脏中进行艰苦奋斗的情况后指出：杨靖宇将军的英勇顽强、艰苦卓绝、毕生忠实于党和人民事业，最后为国牺牲的精神，是值得全军学习的榜样。
    接着，东北三省的代表栗又文、于天放、张雪轩和河南省代表邢肇棠都讲了话。杨靖宇将军在东北抗日联军中的老战友于天放、伊俊山，都在灵前追述了杨靖宇将军和抗日联军的战士当年高举抗日救国的大旗，转战于长白山和鸭绿江边的事迹。他们指出，杨靖宇将军和抗日联军的战士当年在冰天雪地、饥寒交迫的环境中发挥了坚韧不拔的革命精神，将自己的血汗洒遍在白山黑水之间，留下了无数可歌可泣的光辉史迹。
    杨靖宇将军的家属马从云在讲话中感谢党和政府对烈士家属的关怀和照顾，他表示要继承父亲的遗志，坚决为社会主义建设事业奋斗到底。
    最后举行了安葬仪式。主祭人和陪祭代表步入灵堂绕墓一周，和杨靖宇将军最后告别。康生和杨靖宇将军生前的亲密战友周保中、冯仲云、于天放、伊俊山、吴德等为烈士遗体封墓。公祭安葬仪式最后在国际歌声中结束。
    在安葬公祭仪式举行前一天，中共中央政治局候补委员康生，国防部代表邓华上将等向杨靖宇烈士的家属进行了亲切的慰问。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻长春领事李承安应邀参加了今天的仪式，并且在昨天向杨靖宇将军的家属进行了慰问。
    杨靖宇将军的遗体原来存放在哈尔滨东北烈士纪念馆。长白山区的人民为了永久纪念曾在当地转战多年的抗日民族英雄，1954年起就在通化市郊为杨靖宇将军修筑陵墓，并在去年9月将杨靖宇将军遗体由哈尔滨迁来通化准备安葬。
