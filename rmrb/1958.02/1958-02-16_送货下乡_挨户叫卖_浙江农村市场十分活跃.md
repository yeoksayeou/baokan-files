Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 14th: Zhejiang Province's rural market is now fully active, and in many areas, commercial personnel are launching a high tide of delivering goods to the mountains and countryside.

    The current characteristics of the rural market are: not only are sales of consumer goods high, as in previous peak seasons, but sales of production materials have also greatly increased. Due to the emergence of a winter production upsurge, there are three “unwants” in the primary market: waiting for customers to come is not popular, market-day gatherings are not popular, and superstitious consumer goods are not popular.

    The autumn harvest distribution work of agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Zhejiang Province has recently come to an end. It is understood that rural purchasing power in the first quarter of this year will increase by about 23% compared to the same period last year. The total retail sales of commodities in the first quarter are estimated to increase by about 10% compared to the same period last year. Commercial departments in various places are actively organizing sources of goods, generally improving supply methods, and trying to facilitate farmers' purchases. Thousands of commercial personnel and small vendors, day and night, brave the severe cold, wind, and snow to deliver goods to the countryside and mountains, going from village to village selling door-to-door. Commercial departments in many areas have proposed "wherever water conservancy is built, goods will be delivered there." Commercial staff in counties such as Haining, Xiaoshan, and Ninghai have also organized night-time mobile delivery teams to deliver goods to agricultural cooperatives. After the commercial departments did this, the business situation was very good. After the joint state-private stores in Yuhuan County delivered goods to the countryside, the average turnover increased by more than double compared to before the delivery.

    送货下乡　挨户叫卖
    浙江农村市场十分活跃
    新华社杭州14日电　浙江省农村市场现在全面活跃起来，许多地区的商业人员掀起送货上山下乡的高潮。
    目前农村市场出现的特点是：不仅和往年的旺季一样多销生活资料，生产资料的销售量也大大增加；由于冬季生产高潮的出现，初级市场有三不旺：等客上门不旺，市日赶集不旺，迷信消费品不旺。
    浙江省各地农业社的秋收分配工作最近已陆续结束。据了解，今年第一季度农村购买力将比去年同期增加23％左右。第一季度商品零售总额估计将比去年同期增加10％左右。各地商业部门都积极组织货源，普遍改进供应方法，尽量便利农民购买。成千成百的商业人员、小商小贩不分日夜冒着严寒风雪，送货下乡上山，串村挨户叫卖。很多地区的商业部门提出“水利修到那里，货就送到那里”。海宁、萧山、宁海等县的商业工作人员还组织了夜间巡回送货队，把货送到农业社里去。商业部门这样做以后，营业情况都很好。玉环县公私合营商店送货下乡后，营业额平均比下乡前增加一倍以上。
