Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 26th. The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee passed a resolution on the 25th, warmly accepting the proposal from Beijing to Shanghai to launch a friendly patriotic hygiene campaign competition centered on "eliminating the four pests." It will treat the friendly competition as a driving force to set off the fourth upsurge of the city's patriotic hygiene campaign, enabling the advanced to become more advanced, and the backward to take immediate action to catch up with the advanced. It will resolutely eliminate dead corners, make breakthroughs in difficult points, and strive for even greater victories in the movement.

In the fourth upsurge, in addition to continuing to repeatedly besiege pests such as mosquitoes, flies, bed bugs, and cockroaches, the people of Shanghai will concentrate their efforts on making key breakthroughs in eliminating rats and catching sparrows in early March, when rats and sparrows have not yet bred in large numbers, so that rats and sparrows have nowhere to hide. A comprehensive effort will be made to manage the two to three hundred kilometers of large and small stinking rivers that seriously endanger Shanghai's environmental sanitation. Stinking rivers that can be filled in without affecting drainage will be immediately mobilized by the masses to fill them in. Those that cannot be filled in will be organized by the masses to contract sections and carry out dredging, while establishing a management system to regularly maintain the cleanliness and sanitation of the ditches. Factories and shops that breed the "seven pests" will be actively arranged to move to the suburbs and improve their equipment. During this period, propaganda will also be launched for all garbage to be placed in bins and not to spit on the ground, and preventing and eliminating diseases will be regarded as an important goal of the hygiene campaign.

    上海接受北京卫生竞赛倡议
    据新华社上海26日电　上海市人民委员会25日通过决议，热诚接受北京市向上海市提出展开以“除四害”为中心的爱国卫生运动友谊竞赛的倡议，并把友谊竞赛当作动力，掀起全市爱国卫生运动的第四个高潮，使先进的更先进，落后的立即行动起来，赶上先进，坚决消灭死角，突击难点，争取运动取得更大的胜利。
    在第四个高潮中，上海人民除继续向蚊蝇、臭虫、蟑螂等害虫反复进行围攻外，将在3月初趁老鼠、麻雀尚未大量繁殖时节，集中力量重点突击灭鼠、捕雀，使鼠雀无藏身之地。对严重危害上海环境卫生的两三百公里长的大小臭水河浜，全面治理，可以填没而又不影响排水的臭水浜，立即发动群众填没；不能填没的，组织群众分工包干，进行疏捞，同时建立经常保持沟浜环境清洁卫生的管理制度。对于孳生七害的工厂商店，积极安排迁往郊区和进行改善设备。这个时期还要展开垃圾全部入箱，不随地吐痰的宣传，并把预防和消灭疾病当作卫生运动的重要目标。
