　　Water Transport Should Also Have a Great Leap Forward
    Speech by Representative Qiu Jin
    I fully agree with the four reports made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Comrade Wu Yuzhang. Now, I would like to speak on how waterway transportation workers can make water transport serve the new leap forward in national economic development.

    Achievements of Water Transport Work During the First Five-Year Plan
    The water transport tasks of the First Five-Year Plan have been overfulfilled. The Ministry of Communications' directly affiliated inland river and coastal shipping are expected to complete 110.36 percent and 110.69 percent of the cargo volume and cargo turnover volume targets of the Five-Year Plan in 1957, and 120.69 percent and 122.30 percent of the passenger volume and passenger turnover volume targets of the Five-Year Plan.

    During the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, the vast number of water transport workers across the country, under the leadership of the Party, extensively and deeply carried out the advanced producer movement and socialist emulation, demonstrating a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in improving transportation efficiency, accelerating ship turnaround, improving transportation quality, and ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of national plans, making significant contributions. The advanced voyage competition carried out in ships created a total of 1,265 advanced voyages by workers in the Shanghai and Guangzhou Maritime Bureaus alone from 1954 to 1956, increasing operating ton-days by 252,028,139 and increasing revenue by 4,033,722 yuan. The advanced single-ship loading and unloading competition carried out in ports created 3,977 advanced voyages in Shanghai Port alone from January to October 1957, equivalent to increasing the carrying capacity of a 3,000-ton freighter by 92 voyages from Shanghai to Dalian, which could transport 550,000 tons of cargo more. In the single-ship repair competition carried out in shipyards, 88 percent of the ships in Shanghai Shipyard were repaired and left the factory ahead of schedule or on schedule in 1957, providing the shipping department with 469,807 operating ton-days and 75,650 horsepower-days of carrying capacity. Due to the study and promotion of various advanced towing and pushing experiences, the towing efficiency of the Yangtze River has increased by five to ten times. The Yangtze River has also made significant achievements in improving cargo transportation quality. From January to August 1957, cargo damage accidents decreased by 64.5 percent compared to the same period in 1956. In the socialist emulation, the country has witnessed many ships led by Captains Xia Jiazhen and Mo Jiarui safely transporting 200,000 nautical miles (kilometers) and local inland river Captain Huang Zhiliang safely transporting more than 100,000 kilometers, as well as many advanced individuals and units such as the Yao Guoxiang group of Shanghai Shipyard, the Wu Liangxian group of Shanghai Port, the Wang Yuji group of Dalian Port, the Hai Xiang mud dredger of the Navigation Engineering Bureau, diver Shen Asi, and the Lu Hang 118 vessel of the Shandong Shipping Department, who have overfulfilled their plans year after year.

    1958 is the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economic construction. Under the general goal of building a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern culture and science in about fifteen years, and catching up with or surpassing the United Kingdom in terms of steel and major product output, the people of the whole country will launch a new upsurge of comprehensive production to strive for a new leap forward in national economic development. The nation's shipping workers are actively participating in the rectification movement, constantly improving their political awareness, and constantly increasing their production enthusiasm. A new production upsurge is developing. We are welcoming the arrival of the Second Five-Year Plan with unparalleled excitement and striving to overfulfill it.

    Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report proposed striving for a new leap forward in the national economy in 1958. This situation will inevitably promote the continuous growth and expansion of water transport volume and types, and put forward more and higher requirements for water transport work. Due to various reasons, the water transport tasks this spring seem insufficiently abundant, but a busy and tense situation will soon arrive. This is the general trend of water transport work development throughout the year.

    All our water transport workers will bring out the indomitable spirit of the working class and do everything possible to fully adapt the water transport industry to the needs of the new leap forward in national economic development. We will use our brains to come up with ways to solve the major problems currently existing in the water transport industry, continue to extensively and deeply carry out the advanced producer movement and socialist emulation, and, on the basis of improving transportation quality, ensuring transportation safety, and reducing transportation costs, give full play to the advantages of the water transport industry and strive to comprehensively overfulfill the national transportation plan.

　　Several Key Issues in Current Water Transport Work
    I. Improve transportation quality and ensure transportation safety.

    This is the most prominent and crucial issue in water transport that must be thoroughly resolved. Although cargo transportation quality and navigation safety have been continuously improving in recent years, the situation of low quality, many damages and losses, slow arrival, high costs, and many accidents has not been completely reversed in many places. The existence of these problems affects the growth rate of cargo sources from reaching the level it should, and the development of the water transport industry cannot fully meet the requirements of the new leap forward situation in the national economy. Therefore, ensuring transportation quality and ensuring transportation safety is a fundamental task for the current water transport industry. Thoroughly solving this problem in two years will mark a major leap forward in water transport work. Our water transport workers will target these problems in the competition of the advanced producer movement, starting from all aspects, especially from improving every important link in the entire transportation process of "stacking," "transfer," "handover," and "storage," as well as improving navigation conditions, improving operating techniques, and strengthening maintenance, actively learn and promote various advanced experiences, exert greater wisdom, bring out revolutionary vigor, and fully meet the requirements of transportation being safe, complete, accurate, rapid, and convenient.

    II. Reduce transportation costs.

    The current phenomena of high costs and high freight rates in water transport work are the second major problem existing in the water transport industry, which makes it impossible to fully reflect the advantages of large transportation volume, low cost, and low investment in water transport work, and should be thoroughly resolved. High costs and high freight rates are closely related to low quality and many damages and losses. Reducing transportation costs and reducing freight rates are of great significance for promoting the water transport industry to adapt to the needs of the new leap forward in national economic development. The main reason for high transportation costs and high freight rates is the serious waste in various aspects. Our national water transport workers will conscientiously implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and doing everything diligently and thriftily. On the premise of improving quality and ensuring safety, we will carry out the anti-waste struggle in all aspects, vigorously expose the waste phenomena in the use and management of financial, material, and human resources in various aspects, and take effective measures to overcome them. At the same time, we will seize the following key links to vigorously reduce transportation costs and gradually reduce freight rates. Important links are: ① Strengthen maintenance of ships and machinery, improve repair quality, and reduce repair costs; ② Save fuel and materials; ③ Reduce engineering construction costs and improve engineering design and construction quality; ④ Improve waterway dredging quality; ⑤ Combine rectification to vigorously streamline non-production personnel and reduce management expenses; ⑥ Strengthen transportation organization and manpower organization and deployment, greatly reduce waste of transportation capacity and manpower, and make careful calculations from all aspects, oppose waste, practice strict economy, and learn and promote various advanced experiences in saving expenses and saving costs, such as the experience of single-vehicle operation and economic accounting of ship crews. Strive to achieve lower full-process transportation costs than railways on the main water transport lines in the next two years.

    III. Continue to tap transportation potential and enable the water transport industry to adapt to undertaking greater transportation tasks.

    The situation of tight and busy transportation tasks will soon arrive, and the transportation potential of our water transport industry is still very large. For example, port equipment has not been fully utilized, and there is still a lot of waste of transportation capacity in the ship turnaround process. To enable the water transport industry to adapt to the requirements of undertaking greater transportation tasks, our water transport workers will continue to tap transportation potential with the greatest efforts, strengthen transportation organization, improve the utilization rate of port equipment, improve port throughput capacity, accelerate ship turnaround, improve ship repair efficiency on the premise of ensuring quality, carry out the movement of entering the dock without entering the factory on ships, do a good job in waterway and navigation mark construction and maintenance, and ensure accurate waterway depth and light standards to ensure the smooth completion of busy and tense tasks.

    Large-Scale Rectification and Transformation Drives a Great Leap Forward in Overall Work
    IV. Deeply carrying out the rectification movement, raising political awareness, improving thinking, and improving work style is the fundamental way to achieve the above tasks.

    Currently, enterprises in various places are carrying out rectification under the unified leadership of the Party. In the rectification, we will focus on key issues such as low quality, many accidents, and high costs, carry out large-scale airing of views, debates, and contendings, launch a rectification upsurge, thoroughly expose and boldly criticize various bad phenomena that disregard quality, disregard safety, and waste, and fight against various erroneous ideas and behaviors that are not conducive to socialist construction. Based on the problems exposed, we will rely on the strength of the masses to carry out large-scale rectification and transformation. Make rectification a "key link" to improve the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, boost revolutionary vigor, improve transportation quality, ensure safety, reduce costs, and drive a great leap forward in overall work.

    Carry out Socialist Emulation and Give Full Play to the Role of Water Transport
    V. Continue to extensively and deeply carry out the advanced producer movement and socialist emulation.

    While rectifying and transforming, we will vigorously carry out the advanced producer movement, focusing on achieving the key issues mentioned above, continue to deeply carry out advanced voyage competition, advanced single-ship loading and unloading competition, advanced single-ship repair competition, single-item engineering competition, and widely organize collaboration competitions within enterprises, within regions, between enterprises, and between regions. Through various advanced single-operation competitions, the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of shipping workers will be more fully exerted, focusing on the current key issues, learning, exchanging, and promoting advanced experiences in quality, safety, and savings. The advanced experience in loading, unloading, and transporting new types of goods should be summarized and promoted in a timely manner; new technical and work problems caused by changes in cargo flow should be solved in a timely manner. The widespread organization of collaboration competitions between various units, the better combination of advanced single-operation competitions in ports, shipping, and factories, and the strengthening of collaboration and cooperation will form an organic transportation whole. In the competition of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and the advanced advancing further, we will jointly strive to fully play the role of the advantages of water transport on the basis of improving transportation quality, ensuring navigation safety, and reducing transportation costs, and strive to comprehensively and more completely fulfill the national transportation plan.

    In the emulation movement, we will continue to implement the policy of improving technology, raising technology, learning and mastering new technologies, and strive for the overfulfillment of the national transportation tasks on the premise of greatly reducing labor intensity and ensuring health and personal safety, and strictly prevent the continued occurrence of phenomena of simply exerting physical strength, increasing labor intensity, and disregarding safety.

    VI. Supporting agricultural production and construction, striving to achieve the agricultural development program ahead of schedule, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance are the glorious tasks of every water transport worker. Local inland river shipping plays a more direct role in accelerating the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and supporting agricultural construction. Giving full play to the role of local inland river transportation so that it can undertake greater transportation tasks is an important part of adapting the entire water transport work to the new leap forward in national economic development. Therefore, the workers of local inland rivers must further deepen the advanced producer movement in order to better complete the major task of supporting the great development of agriculture.

　　水运事业也要来个大跃进
    丘金代表的发言
    我完全同意彭真副委员长、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理和吴玉章同志等所作的四个报告。现谨就水路运输职工如何使水运事业为适应国民经济发展新跃进服务作个发言。
    第一个五年计划期间  水运工作的成就
    第一个五年计划的水上运输任务已经超额完成。交通部直属内河与沿海预计一九五七年货运量和货运周转量完成五年计划指标的百分之一百一十点三六和百分之一百一十点六九，客运量与客运周转量完成五年计划指标的百分之一百二十点六九和百分之一百二十二点三○。
    在完成第一个五年计划期间，全国广大水运职工，在党的领导下，广泛深入地开展了先进生产者运动和社会主义竞赛，为提高运输效率、加速船舶周转、改进运输质量、保证完成与超额完成国家计划方面，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，作出了重大的贡献。在船舶中开展的先进航次竞赛，自一九五四年到一九五六年，仅上海和广州二个海运局的职工共创造一千二百六十五个先进航次，增加二亿五千二百零二万八千一百三十九营运吨天，增加收入四百零三万三千七百二十二元。在港湾中开展的先进单船装卸竞赛，仅上海港一九五七年一至十月份就创造三千九百七十七个先进航次，相等于增加一艘三千吨的货轮从上海至大连九十二个航次的运力，可多运货物五十五万吨。在修船厂中开展的单船修理竞赛，上海船厂一九五七年有百分之八十八的船舶提前和按期修好出厂，为航运部门提供了四十六万九千八百零七营运吨天和七万五千六百五十马力天的运力。长江由于学习与推广各种先进拖带和顶推经验，拖带效率提高了五倍到十倍，在提高货运质量方面长江也有显著的成绩，一九五七年一至八月货损事故比一九五六年同期减少了百分之六十四点五。在社会主义竞赛中，全国涌现了许多像夏家箴、莫家瑞船长所领导的安全运输二十万海里（公里）和地方内河黄志良船长所领导的安全运输十万公里以上的船舶，以及像上海船厂姚国祥小组、上海港吴良先小组和大连港王玉吉小组，航务工程局海象吹泥船、潜水员沈阿四、山东航运厅鲁航118轮等许多年年超额完成计划的先进人物和单位。
    一九五八年是我国发展国民经济建设进入第二个五年计划的第一年。全国人民在十五年左右建成具有现代工业、现代农业与现代文化科学的社会主义强国与在钢铁和主要产品产量方面赶上或者超过英国的总目标下，将为争取国民经济发展新跃进掀起全面生产新高潮。全国航运职工，正在积极参加整风运动、政治觉悟不断提高，生产情绪也不断高涨，新的生产高潮正在发展，我们以无比兴奋的心情迎接第二个五年计划的到来，并大力争取其超额完成。
    薄一波副总理报告中提出了争取一九五八年国民经济的新跃进。这种形势必将促使水运运量和运输品种的不断增长和扩大，对水运工作提出更多和更高的要求。由于各种原因，今春水路运输任务显得不够充裕，但繁忙和紧张的局面不久就要到来的。这是全年水运工作发展的总趋势。
    我们全体水运职工，将拿出顽强不屈的工人阶级干劲，用千方百计来使水运事业充分适应国民经济发展新跃进的需要。开动脑筋想出办法来解决水运事业当前存在的重大问题，继续广泛深入地开展先进生产者运动和社会主义竞赛，在提高运输质量、保证运输安全、降低运输成本的基础上，充分发挥水运事业优越性的作用，争取全面超额完成国家运输计划。
　　当前水运工作中的几个关键问题
    一、提高运输质量，保证运输安全。
    这是当前水上运输中一个最为突出的必须彻底解决的重大问题。近年来货运质量和航行安全虽在不断改进，但是质量较低、差损较多、到达较慢、费用较高、事故较多的情况，许多地方仍未彻底扭转。问题的存在，影响货源增长速度未能达到应有的程度，使水运事业的发展，不能充分适应国民经济新跃进形势的要求。因此，保证运输质量、保证运输安全，对当前水运事业说来是一个带根本性的工作。在二年期间把这个问题彻底加以解决就标志着水运工作的一次大跃进。我们水运职工，将在先进生产者运动的竞赛中，针对这些问题，从各方面，特别是从改进整个运输过程的“堆存”、“转运”、“交接”、“储存”以及改善航行条件、提高操作技术、加强养护维修等每一个重要环节入手，积极地学习与推广各种先进经验，发挥更大的智慧，拿出革命干劲，充分作到运输安全、完整、准确、迅速、简便的要求。
    二、降低运输成本。
    目前水运工作中成本高、运费高的现象是水运事业当前存在的第二个重大问题，这问题的存在就使水运工作的运量大、成本低、投资少的优越性不能很好体现，应该彻底解决。成本高、运费高是与质量低、损差多密切的联系着的。而降低运输成本，降低运费对于促使水运事业适应国民经济发展新跃进的需要又有着重要的意义。目前运输成本高、运价高的主要原因是由于各方面浪费现象严重。我们全国水运职工，将认真地贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业和勤俭办一切事的方针。在提高质量、保证安全的前提下，从各方面开展反浪费斗争，大力揭发各方面财力、物力、人力使用和管理的浪费现象，采取有效办法加以克服。同时抓住如下几个重要环节大力降低运输成本，逐步降低运价。重要环节是：①加强船舶和机器维修保养，提高修理质量，降低修理费用；②节约燃、材料；③降低工程造价，提高工程设计、施工质量；④提高航道疏浚质量；⑤结合整风大力精简非生产人员，减少管理费用的开支；⑥加强运输组织工作和人力的组织调配工作，大量减少运力和人力的浪费，从一切方面精打细算，反对浪费、厉行节约，学习和推广各种节约开支节约成本的先进经验，如单车运行和船舶班组经济核算的经验。争取在今后二年内在主要水运干线上，作到全程运输费用低于铁路。
    三、继续挖掘运输潜力，使水运事业适应于承担更大的运输任务。
    运输任务紧张繁忙的局面不久就将到来，而我们水运事业的运输潜力仍然很大。如港口设备未有充分利用，船舶周转过程中运力浪费仍然很大。要使水运事业适应于承担更大的运输任务的要求，我们水运职工，将以最大的努力继续挖掘运输潜力，加强运输组织工作，提高港湾设备利用率，提高港口通过能力，加速船舶周转，在保证质量的前提下提高修船效率，在船上开展进坞不进厂运动，作好航道航标建设与维护工作，保证航道水深与灯标准确，以保证繁忙紧张的任务顺利完成。
    大整大改带动  全盘工作大跃进
    四、深入进行整风运动，提高政治觉悟，改进思想改进作风，是实现上述任务的根本办法。
    现各地企业都在党的统一领导下进行整风。在整风中，我们将针对质量低、事故多、成本高等关键问题，进行大鸣大放、大辩大争，掀起整风高潮，彻底揭发和大胆批判各种不顾质量、不顾安全与浪费的不良现象，与各种不利于社会主义建设的错误思想和行为作斗争。并根据揭发出的问题，依靠群众力量进行大整大改。使整风成为提高职工积极性创造性，鼓起革命干劲，成为提高运输质量、保证安全、降低成本和带动全盘工作大跃进的“纲”。
    开展社会主义竞赛  充分发挥水运作用
    五、继续广泛深入地开展先进生产者运动和社会主义竞赛。
    在整改的同时大力开展先进生产者运动，围绕实现上述所提的关键问题，继续深入开展先进航次竞赛、先进单船装卸竞赛、先进单船修理竞赛、单项工程竞赛和广泛组织企业内部、地区内部、企业之间、地区之间的协作竞赛。通过各种先进单项作业竞赛，把广大航运职工的积极性和创造性，更充分地发挥起来，针对当前的关键问题，学习、交流与推广质量、安全、节约等先进经验。对新货种的装卸与运输的先进经验，及时地加以总结推广；对货物流向变化引起的技术上和工作上新问题及时加以解决。广泛的组织各单位的协作竞赛、把港、航、厂等各个环节的先进单项作业竞赛更好地结合起来，加强协作配合，形成一个有机的运输整体。在学先进，赶先进，先进的再前进的竞赛中共同争取在提高运输质量、保证航行安全、降低运输成本的基础上，充分发挥水运优越性的作用，为全面的更多的完成国家运输计划而奋斗。
    在竞赛运动中，继续贯彻改进技术、提高技术、学习与掌握新技术的方针，在大力降低劳动强度，保证健康与人身安全的前提下，争取国家运输任务的超额完成，严格防止单纯拚体力，提高劳动强度与不顾安全的现象继续发生。
    六、支援农业生产建设，争取农业发展纲要的提前实现与巩固工农联盟，是每一个水运职工的光荣任务。各地方内河航运，对加速城乡物资交流，支援农业建设起着更为直接的作用，充分发挥地方内河运输的作用，使能担负更大的运输任务，是使整个水运工作适应国民经济发展新跃进一个重要组成部分。因此，地方内河的职工要进一步深入开展先进生产者运动，以更好的完成支援农业大发展的重大任务。
