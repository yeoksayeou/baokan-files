At Pyongyang Station
Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respected Premier Comrade, Dear Comrades and Friends:

Today, with reluctance, we bid farewell to your country and people. Before leaving, I would like to express, on behalf of all members of the Chinese Government Delegation, our heartfelt gratitude once again to the Korean government, the Korean people, and Premier Kim Il-sung for your warm welcome and kind reception, and for the profound feelings and sincere friendship you have expressed towards the Chinese people.

Our friendly visit to Korea this time, although short, will leave extremely pleasant memories in our future days. Through on-the-spot visits, we have seen that the Korean people, united around the Workers' Party and the Republic's government, have already achieved great successes in the cause of socialist construction and are full of firm confidence in creating a bright future. The Korean people's hard work, diligence, spirit of not fearing difficulties, and good sense of discipline have left us with a deep impression. We will convey the many beneficial things we have seen this time to the Chinese people.

During the visit, we held sincere and friendly talks with Premier Kim Il-sung and other leading comrades of the Republic's government. Based on the results of the talks, the two governments have already issued a joint statement on the 19th of this month. I believe that the proactive measures and new efforts taken by our two countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and ease tensions in the Far East will certainly have a positive and far-reaching impact. We have stated that the two countries will continue to unswervingly strengthen the strength and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and resolutely support all peace-loving countries and peoples in taking various positive measures to safeguard peace and oppose imperialist aggression. After this meeting, the friendly unity, cooperative relations, and mutual assistance between our two countries will certainly be further developed and consolidated.

Comrades and friends, we are about to part ways with you. We came with the friendship of the Chinese people and now we will return laden with the friendship of the Korean people. The Chinese and Korean peoples, who have a long-standing fighting friendship, will always cooperate closely and be as close as brothers in our common cause in the future.

The united and well-tested Korean people, under the leadership of the Workers' Party and the Republic's government, will surely achieve final victory in their efforts to build socialism and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland!

Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its leading force, the Korean Workers' Party!

Long live the unbreakable great friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!

Long live the solid unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

Goodbye.

    同志们和朋友们，我们就要同你们分手了。我们带着中国人民的友情而来，现在又将满载着朝鲜人民的友情而去。有着长期战斗友谊的中朝人民，在今后的共同事业中，将永远密切合作，亲如兄弟。
