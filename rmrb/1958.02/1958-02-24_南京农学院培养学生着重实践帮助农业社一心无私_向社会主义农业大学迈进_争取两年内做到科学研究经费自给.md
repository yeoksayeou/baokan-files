    Nanjing Agricultural College, driven and inspired by the great leap forward in agricultural production, has adopted measures such as sending teachers down to participate in labor training, running experimental farms well, and moving towards a socialist agricultural university, so as to closely integrate teaching work with labor production.
    More than one-third of the school's lecturers, a total of 114 teachers, have already gone to the countryside to participate in agricultural production and technical extension stations, and to trial-manufacture agricultural machinery.
    In addition, Nanjing Agricultural College has also decided to support the great leap forward in agriculture in the suburbs of Nanjing, ensuring that the October, Red Flag, Red Light, and Zijinshan agricultural cooperatives they are linked with complete their production increase targets, livestock are safe, and become pest-free cooperatives. Within the year, it will help the suburbs of Nanjing to comprehensively investigate soil conditions, provide specific technical measures for improving the soil, and make full use of the agricultural machinery of the Agricultural Machinery Department to cultivate 3,000 mu of land for agricultural cooperatives and thresh 900,000 kilograms of grain. The experimental farms and ranches will expand the production of improved varieties of crops, livestock, and poultry to supply agricultural cooperatives. Running the experimental farms and ranches well should achieve low costs and high yields. This year, the farm's grain crops will strive to reach an average of 1,500 jin per mu, cotton will reach an average of 450 jin of seed cotton per mu, and high-yield fields will reach an average of 600 jin of seed cotton per mu. All dry land on the farm will be transformed into paddy fields, becoming a pest-free farm. It is guaranteed that the farms and ranches will have a surplus of 70,000 yuan this year, and within two years will be able to completely solve the school's scientific research funding with the surplus from the farms and ranches. The vacant land on campus, in addition to greening and planting trees, will all be used as production practice sites. All of the farms' and ranches' more than 20,000 temporary workers throughout the year will be filled by faculty, staff, and students. In order to achieve the guarantee of the demonstration farm, faculty, staff, and students participated in the farm's water conservancy work during the winter vacation this year, completing 12,000 earthworks and transforming more than 1,100 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Currently, there are 400 laborers engaged in field management on the farm every day.
    Since 1953, Nanjing Agricultural College has consistently adhered to the policy of "going deep into the countryside and facing production" in its teaching and scientific research work, and has established deep friendly relations with agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Nanjing. Last year, the Agricultural College organized a comprehensive work team to provide comprehensive technical guidance to the October cooperative's crops from sowing to harvest. With the help of the work team, the Ninth Production Team significantly increased the production of various crops and greatly increased its income. For example, sweet potatoes averaged 1,900 jin per mu, an increase of 199% over last year and 72.7% higher than the average yield of the entire cooperative; rapeseed also increased by 121.9% over the average yield of the entire cooperative. Every household in the team increased its income, with an average income of 118.5 yuan per person, exceeding the average income of 78.6 yuan for local middle peasants. Last year, the intercropping of soybeans and corn demonstrated by Ge Yufa's team increased the production of soybeans and corn by 100,000 jin. This year, the cooperative has, according to the work team's advice, re-divided the land, changing the single production team into a diversified management production team, so as to have planting and harvesting in all four seasons, and gradually achieve full utilization and reasonable allocation of land and labor. Labor model Shen Zhanglin said that the method of raising sweet potato seedlings in glass greenhouses is really good, and it has been decided to fully promote it this year, striving to produce 2,500 jin of sweet potatoes per mu.
    The Agricultural College's support for agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs is selfless, truly providing whatever the cooperatives need, whenever they need it, and is widely welcomed by agricultural cooperatives. When a severe outbreak of swine fever occurred in the Dingshan cooperative, more than 40 teachers and students from the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department suspended classes to go and extinguish the swine fever and rescue piglets. Last year, during the severe autumn drought, the Agricultural Machinery Department dispatched tractors to help the Heping cooperative carry out timely plowing and harrowing to seize the planting season. The cooperative's tomato yield was low, matured late, and teachers from the Vegetable and Fruit Teaching and Research Group sent them improved varieties of turnips and cabbages propagated by the Agricultural College, and also taught them the techniques of raising seedlings in warm frames and transplanting in nutrient pots, so that tomatoes were supplied to the market six to nineteen days earlier, and the yield could be increased by 2,000 jin per mu. In 1956, teachers and students also used their spare time to run a "spare-time technical school" for more than 90 people in the Red Flag cooperative, teaching cultivation knowledge of crops such as wheat, corn, and soybeans, and improving the agricultural technical level of the students.
    After teachers and students walked out of the classroom and laboratory and combined with production, they became familiar with the operation methods of agricultural production, and the rich and vivid teaching materials in practice greatly enriched the teaching content and improved the quality of teaching. This teaching method of linking with reality has also further strengthened the labor concept of teachers and students. Teachers generally request to go to the countryside to work, and students all demand that they first become farmers who can farm. (Shi Yue'e)

    南京农学院培养学生着重实践帮助农业社一心无私
    向社会主义农业大学迈进
    争取两年内做到科学研究经费自给
    本报讯　南京农学院在农业生产大跃进的推动和鼓舞下，采取下放教师劳动锻炼，办好实习农场，向社会主义农业大学迈进等措施，使教学工作密切与劳动生产相结合。
    占全校讲师三分之一以上的一百一十四位教师，已经下乡参加农业生产和技术推广站、试制农业机械等工作。
    除此，南京农学院还决定支援南京郊区农业大跃进，保证他们所联系的十月、红旗、红光和紫金山等农业社完成增产指标，六畜平安，并成为无虫害社。年内要帮助南京郊区全面调查土壤情况，提供改良土壤的具体技术措施，并充分利用农机系的农业机具为郊区农业社代耕土地三千亩，脱粒九十万公斤。实习农、牧场扩大良种、种畜、种禽的生产，以供应农业社。办好实习农、牧场要达到成本低、产量高。今年农场粮食作物争取平均每亩达到一千五百斤，棉花平均每亩达到籽棉四百五十斤，丰产田平均每亩达到籽棉六百斤。把农场旱地全部变成水田，成为无虫害农场。保证农、牧场今年盈余七万元，两年内完全做到以农、牧场的盈余解决学校科学研究的经费。校园内的空隙地除绿化植树外，全部利用做生产实习地。农、牧场全年二万多个临时工全部由师生员工充任。为了实现示范农场的保证，师生员工在今年寒假中，参加了农场的水利工作，完成了一万二千土方，把一千一百多亩旱地变成了水田。目前，每天都有四百个劳动力在农场里进行田间管理。
    南京农学院从1953年以来，教学和科学研究工作一贯坚持了“深入农村、面向生产”的方针，和南京郊区的农业社建立了深厚的友谊联系。去年，农学院组织了综合工作组，对十月社的农作物从播种到收获的整个过程中，进行全面技术指导。第九生产小队在工作组的帮助下，各种作物显著增产，收入也大大增加。如山芋每亩平均产一千九百斤，比去年增产199％，比全社平均产量增加72.7％；油菜也比全社平均产量增产121.9％。全队户户增加收入，每人平均收入达118.5元，超过了当地中农78.6元的平均收入。去年在葛玉发队示范的黄豆、玉米间作这一措施，就增产了黄豆和玉米十万斤。今年，该社已经根据工作组的意见，重新划分了土地，改变单一生产队为多种经营的生产队，做到一年四季有种有收，土地和劳力逐步做到充分利用，合理调配。劳动模范沈章林说，山芋用玻璃温框育苗的办法真好，今年决定全部推行，争取每亩产山芋二千五百斤。
    农学院对郊区农业社的支援是无私的，真正做到合作社需要什么就支援什么，随要随到，受到农业社的普遍欢迎。顶山社发生了严重的猪瘟，牧医系师生四十余人停课前去扑灭猪瘟，抢救小猪。去年秋旱严重，农机系出动拖拉机帮助和平社及时进行耕耙抢种。该社的番茄产量低，成熟迟，果蔬教研组的教师们把农学院繁殖的芜菁甘蓝良种送给他们，还教授了温框育苗，营养钵移栽的技术，使番茄提早六天至十九天供应市场，每亩还可增产二千斤。1956年师生还利用课余时间，在红旗社举办了九十余人的“业余技术学校”，讲授了小麦、玉米、大豆等作物的栽培知识，提高了学员的农业技术水平。
    教师和学生走出课堂和研究室，和生产相结合之后，熟悉了农业生产的操作方法，实际中丰富的活教材大大充实了教学内容，提高了教学质量。这种联系实际的教学方法，也进一步加强了师生的劳动观念，教师们普遍要求下乡劳动，同学们都要求自己首先做一个会种田的农民。　（史越峨）
