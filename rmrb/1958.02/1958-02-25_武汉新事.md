    New Things in Wuhan
    By our reporter Zhang Pei
    Experimental Fields and "One-Dragon"

    The regular work of a reporter is to see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and think with their brains. And writing is the result of seeing, hearing, and thinking. These days in Wuhan, what I saw most was the city-wide mobilization, every household cleaning up and eliminating the four pests. What I heard most was new vocabulary like "experimental fields," "one-dragon," and "on-site meetings." The speakers were completely familiar with them, but the listeners found them very fresh. From these new things I heard, what I thought about most was: a revolutionary spirit is surging here, a revolutionary atmosphere is rising here.

    The leadership method of experimental fields has now spread from Hubei to many provinces and has become a new method familiar and practiced by many. In Hubei, it can be said to be "mass-based." Needless to say, county party secretaries have all planted experimental fields, and so have the branch secretaries of agricultural cooperatives. Even the cadres in Songbu town alone have planted 150 mu of experimental fields. Don't think that as long as your thinking is clear, planting experimental fields will be without any difficulties. The workers at the Songbu Bus Station, because they often go to the countryside to help farmers repair farm tools, also can't be completely ignorant of farming, so they also participated in planting experimental fields. But they had neither hoes nor carrying poles, so how could they farm? The easiest way would be for the public to pay for farm tools. However, the public doesn't buy farm tools for farmers, so some workers at this bus station came up with two solutions. The first was to catch sparrows; the second was to collect scrap iron. The income from these two tasks was used to buy farm tools, which not only provided the means of production for planting experimental fields, but also eliminated the four pests and utilized waste materials. When policy becomes the action of the masses, solutions will emerge everywhere.

    Leading cadres who plant experimental fields must have "three combinations." This is also a new vocabulary I heard in Wuhan. What is "three combinations"? It means that leading cadres, technical cadres, and farmers combine to plant experimental fields. Because the purpose of planting experimental fields is to enable leaders to discover problems and summarize experiences from field labor, which can be used to guide agricultural production. Therefore, it is difficult to ask leading cadres to farm a piece of land like the members, and it must be done in combination with technical cadres and members to gain experience and guide the general public. Comrade Wang Renzhong, the first secretary of the provincial party committee, told reporters, "I've been away from home for more than a month. If I planted alone, my experimental field would be abandoned. But when I'm home, I have to go every Friday afternoon."

    The leadership method of experimental fields has crossed the fields and developed to workshops. The "one-dragon" in several textile factories in Wuhan was produced under the influence of experimental fields. The Changjiang Daily published that the "one-dragon" of Wuchang No. 1 Yarn Factory was doing a better job. On the night before leaving Wuhan, I rushed to this factory close to the river.

    This factory is divided into north and south fields and produces three shifts, so the workshops are brightly lit at night. On one side, the sound of looms is loud, on the other side, the Yangtze River is roaring. In the distance, the bridge lights on the Yangtze River Bridge are strung across the wide river like pearls. In the office of the factory party committee secretary, several comrades who had been arranged in advance were waiting for me. They were Ge Ming, deputy secretary of the party committee, Zhai Honglai, engineer, and Zhang Xiufeng, director of the party committee office.

    From 7 pm to 10 pm, I had a relatively complete concept of one-dragon. Omit the technical details and tell the reader clearly:

    The "one-dragon" method is not new. It has appeared in textile factories in Zhengzhou and Qingdao. Some call it standard machine tool. It also appeared in this yarn factory last year. At that time, the "one-dragon" was for: increasing new products, changes in raw cotton, or major problems in production, which were tested through the "one-dragon." Therefore, it was a purely technical and temporary measure. Now, the above content is still the task to be undertaken by the "one-dragon," but it is no longer the main task. It has changed from purely technical to a leadership method that combines technology and politics, from temporary to regular. In the words of Ge Ming, deputy secretary of the factory party committee, it is: "To change the leadership style, go deep into production practice, so that leaders can grasp both the technical situation and the ideological situation of the masses. Learn from the one-dragon to improve the production of the entire factory."

    The so-called one-dragon in this factory is to fix key machine tools (they call them pioneer machine tools) in various continuously producing processes. From the three aspects of machinery, process design, and technical operation, a testing production line is formed, which is controlled by the chief engineer to determine the focus of the experiment. The three aspects check each other, and after gaining experience, it is promoted on all machine tools, the purpose is to achieve advanced production indicators. The factory manager, party committee secretary, and other leaders are not allowed to hold meetings for three mornings a week, and they are all fixedly assigned to various workshops to help study and solve problems.

    This yarn factory has been engaged in one-dragon since the beginning of January this year, and it has been less than a month, and the effect has been very significant in the steel wire and drawing processes, exceeding the prescribed indicators. There are still many problems in the roving process, and we are actively trying to solve them. The effect of one-dragon is not only reflected in the improvement of production, the fact that leading cadres go to the workshop is itself an encouragement to the majority of employees. The leading cadres of this factory used to never go to the workshop, so the masses reflected: "It's happy to see the leaders come to the workshop to run around, it doesn't matter if they don't solve any problems."

    Now this factory, in order to achieve advanced production indicators, their immediate goal is to "catch up with Wuhan State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1," and the long-term competition slogan is: "Catch up with Shanghai this year, catch up with Qingdao next year!" The momentum is very strong.

    The current problem is that this new leadership method has not been completely consolidated, and the experience gained from the "one-dragon" has not been popularized to all machine tools to form a system. However, the benefits are certain. According to reporters, all continuous production enterprises can refer to this method and try it.

    Wuchang No. 1 Yarn Factory is an old factory. It was built in 1916 by Hubei commercial capitalists Li Ziyun and others, and put into production in 1920. Now it is a joint state-private venture. It has 100,000 old-fashioned British-made spindles. But its more than 6,000 employees are new socialists. New people will surely overcome old machines, and this factory is galloping forward like a dragon.

    The Tide of Visits

    If you want to ask what is the most popular style in Wuhan City and Hubei Province now, I think it should be the style of visiting.

    The province-wide large-scale visit and evaluation has become a feature of the great leap forward in production. The county, district, and village cadres in each county have recently visited Macheng, Junxian, and other places because these places are advanced in agricultural production. However, Macheng's cotton was not only not advanced but also backward, behind its neighboring county, Xinzhou. Macheng was not willing to be so backward, so it sent 6,000 members to the Dadu Township and Liuji Township of Xinzhou to see why other people's cotton grew so well. This visit learned the advantages of Xinzhou, coupled with a lot of hard work, and then things turned around. Last year, the cotton yield per unit area in Macheng exceeded that of Xinzhou.

    Wuhan's State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1 is a new factory with good machinery, equipment, and other conditions, but some employees of this factory still feel dissatisfied, demanding a lot, and not very motivated. At the same time, workers also have opinions on cadres not going deep into production. Therefore, this factory organized a large number of employees to visit the frugal Xiangyang Cotton Textile Factory and the rural areas of Junxian. After comparing, they found that there was a problem with their thinking. After returning, the atmosphere changed greatly, and all kinds of demands were put aside, and the motivation also increased. They used eight words to describe the current situation: full of revolution, full of energy.

    The enthusiasm of State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1 spread, and some factories sent people to visit this factory. The enthusiasm of State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1 also promoted other factories to exert their energy, like the waves of the Yangtze River pushing forward, rushing in. The "one-dragon" of Wuchang No. 1 Yarn Factory was started after visiting State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1.

    The reporter also heard that there is a kind of "secret visit" in the countryside, that is, without notifying the other party, secretly learning from others' advanced experience, and coming back to work hard. Later, the provincial party committee knew and told them: Revolutionary competition, do it openly and generously, don't do it secretly. Whether there are still "secret visits" now, the reporter does not know.

    "Organizing cadres and the masses to visit and evaluate is more powerful and effective than the speech of the provincial party committee secretary." Wang Renzhong, the first secretary of the provincial party committee, introduced the benefits of visiting to reporters. No wonder it will form a tide. It has become a mass line leadership method.

    On the morning of the day the reporter left Wuhan, turning to the local newspaper, I saw a news item about the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee organizing a visiting group to go to the countryside to visit on that day. Then I visited Comrade Li Yiqing, the general manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, and wanted to talk about the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation. As soon as we met, he said to me: "You are lucky to come today, tomorrow I will take 300 people to Hongan Macheng to visit. Go to the countryside to learn revolutionary enthusiasm and build Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation faster and better." The steel of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation will become various agricultural machines and sent to the countryside to promote the technical revolution in agriculture. And today, the great leap forward in agricultural production is promoting the builders of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation to refuel.

    I left Wuhan for Changsha that afternoon. The next day I heard that nearly half of the 86 counties in Hunan Province had sent people to visit Hubei. Their slogan is "Go to Hubei to learn from the experience." Advanced typical examples are playing such a huge role in promoting the socialist cause, and visiting has become the simplest and most effective way to spread this advanced experience. These do not need any further explanation.

    Night Visit to Wang Renzhong

    At present, all aspects of work in the country are in a revolutionary great leap forward. The leadership must keep up with this leap forward situation, one is in ideological understanding, and the other is in working methods. It should be said that Hubei Province has paid attention to catching up with the development of the situation from these two aspects, and has achieved results. Here, it can be said that new things are emerging one after another. But how can we enable party committees at all levels and leading cadres at all levels to lead the masses to quickly adapt to the requirements of this situation development? I pondered this question and wanted to ask Comrade Wang Renzhong, the first secretary of the provincial party committee.

    Before going, I made a phone call. The one who answered the phone was Comrade Wang Renzhong himself, not his secretary. When we explained our intention, his reply was: go to his place tonight. Reporters on the road can encounter such a frank and enthusiastic leader, naturally very happy.

    When we met at his residence in the evening, this leader of Hubei Province, who looked only about forty years old, young and energetic, talked frankly like he did on the phone.

    "After the Second Plenary Session of the Party, we emphasized hard work and leading production. After the Third Plenary Session of the Party, we emphasized the great leap forward in agriculture. In the agricultural leap forward, we paid attention to promoting advanced experience, and the method was to organize extensive visits and evaluations. This method is effective and labor-saving. In the past, we also organized visits, but they were mostly small-scale and technical. As for focusing on improving the leadership style and leadership methods, it started in 1957.

    "Seeing is easier to accept than listening and holding meetings. When watching, we also listen to lectures, but it is not the provincial party committee that speaks, but the local host. We sometimes say a few words, just asking what problems there are. But the first thing to do when visiting is for the first secretary of the party committee to go. If his thinking is clear, things will be easy to handle, and everything will be possible.

    "The high tide has a great impetus for the improvement of leadership methods. This is called the situation forcing people. If you don't move, then the branch secretary in the township will ask you: other counties have 800 jin, 1,000 jin, why doesn't your county party secretary move? This forcing will raise enthusiasm. The enthusiasm of the leading cadres promotes the masses, and the enthusiasm of the masses in turn promotes the leadership. This is called mutual promotion from top to bottom, left and right. This time I went to the countryside, and on the way I saw slogans such as 'Compete with Macheng, catch up with Xiaogan' posted on the manure piles. The enthusiasm is unprecedented. The county party secretary of a county proposed the slogan 'Live ten years less, catch up with Macheng.' The determination is good, but why live ten years less? Wouldn't it be better to live ten years longer? We do need to be determined to fight hard for three years to eliminate ordinary water and drought disasters and fundamentally change the face of the countryside."

    Speaking of this, Comrade Wang Renzhong turned to another topic: "Make crops grow according to people's requirements." He said: "We now have a vague concept. When talking about harvest, we always talk about how the year is, which means that everything is at the mercy of nature, and we don't believe that people can make crops produce as much as they want. Since some unit area yields have reached 1,000 jin, why can't other places be 1,000 jin? People's subjective initiative can do this, which is in line with objective conditions. Lin Shimeng, a branch secretary in Macheng, produced 1,200 jin of seed cotton per mu and 500 jin of wheat per mu. He can make the crops grow as high as he wants, and make the cotton bear as many peaches as he wants. Isn't this proof? The problem lies in improving technology. The cotton in Lisheng Township, Macheng, is thousands of jin per mu. There, technology has become the wealth of the masses. Every member can say what shortcomings there were in cotton planting in 1957 and what should be done in 1958. So the cotton there can be high-yielding."

    Finally, Comrade Wang Renzhong talked about: "During this period, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses is great. It is still possible to make a sudden attack, but we must pay attention not to overdo it. Recently, farmers in some places have reported fatigue, which deserves attention. In addition, in order to support the countryside, some cities and towns have actually made Sundays agricultural production days, which should also be appropriately restrained. For example, wouldn't it be better to work half a day and rest half a day on Sundays?"

    The night was deep, and we said goodbye to Comrade Wang Renzhong, thanking him for this useful conversation. On the way back, I thought: Under the leadership of the party, a great revolution of production struggle participated by millions of people is taking place in our motherland, and its trend will inevitably lead to a historical technical revolution.

    武汉新事
    本报记者　张沛
    试验田和“一条龙”
    记者的经常工作一个是用眼睛去看，一个是用耳朵去听，一个是用脑子去想。而写，是看和听加上想的结果。这几天在武汉，记者看得最多的是全城总动员，家家户户打扫卫生除四害。听得最多的是“试验田”、“一条龙”、“现场会议”等等新语汇。说的人毫不生疏，可是听的人却很新鲜。从听到的这些新事里，想得最多的是：一种革命的精神在这里跃动着，一种革命的风气在这里上升着。
    试验田的领导方法，现在已从湖北普及到许多省份，已成了许多人所熟悉所实践的新方法了。而在湖北可以说是“群众性”的了。县委书记不用说都种了试验田，农业合作社的支部书记也种试验田。光宋埠这个镇上的干部就种了一百五十亩试验田。不要以为只要思想通了种试验田就一点困难都没有了。宋埠汽车站的职工因为经常下乡帮助农民修农具，完全不懂庄稼活也是不行的，因此也参加种试验田。但他们既没有锄头也没有扁担，怎么去种田呢？让公家出钱买农具是最简便的办法。然而农民种田公家并没有给买农具呵，于是这个汽车站的一些职工就想出了两条办法。第一是捉麻雀；第二是拣废铁。用这两项工作的收入来买农具，既提供了种试验田的生产手段，又除了四害，利用了废料。当政策变成群众的行动时，办法就会到处钻出来。
    领导干部种试验田一定要“三结合”，这也是记者在武汉听到的新语汇。什么叫“三结合”，就是领导干部、技术干部、农民结合起来种试验田。因为种试验田的目的是使领导者能从田间劳动中发现问题总结经验，用来指导农业生产。因此，要求领导干部像社员一样种一块地是困难的，而必须和技术干部、社员结合起来办，从中取得经验，指导一般。省委第一书记王任重同志对记者说：“我这一个多月不在家，如果光我一人种，我那块试验田非荒了不可。但是我在家时，每星期五下午就一定得去”。
    试验田的领导方法，已经越过了田野发展到车间里。武汉几个纺织厂的“一条龙”，就是在试验田的影响下产生的。长江日报上登载着武昌第一纱厂的“一条龙”搞得比较好。在离开武汉的前一个晚上，我赶到这个紧靠着江边的工厂去。
    这个厂分为南北两个场，是三班生产，所以夜晚各个车间也是灯火通明。一边是机杼声大作，一边是江涛的奔腾。远处，长江大桥上的桥灯，像珍珠一样横串在宽阔的江面上。在工厂党委书记的办公室里，几个事先约好的同志已在等着我。他们是党委副书记葛明、工程师翟鸿赉、党委办公室主任张秀峰。
    从晚七点一直谈到十点，我对于一条龙已经有了一个比较完整的概念。略去技术细节，把它简明地告诉读者：
    “一条龙”这个方法并不是新的，在郑州、在青岛的纺织工厂都出现过，有的把这叫作标准机台。去年在这个纱厂也出现过。那时候搞“一条龙”，是为了：增加新产品，原棉有变化或者生产上发生重大问题时，通过“一条龙”来试验。因此它是纯粹技术性的和临时性的措施。现在上述这些内容，还是“一条龙”所要担负的任务，但已不是主要的任务了，它已从纯粹的技术性变为技术和政治相结合的领导方法，从临时性变为经常性。用这个厂的党委副书记葛明的话说就是：“为了改变领导作风深入生产实际，使领导干部既能掌握技术情况，又能掌握群众的思想情况。从一条龙取得经验来提高全厂的生产。”
    这个工厂的所谓一条龙，就是在连续生产的各个工序固定重点机台（他们叫作先锋机台），从机械、工艺设计、技术操作等三个方面，形成一条试验的流水线，由总工程师来掌握，确定试验的重点，三个方面相互检查，取得经验后在全部机台上推广，目的是实现先进的生产指标。工厂的经理、党委书记等领导干部每星期有三个上午不许开会，全部固定分配在各个车间里，帮助研究和解决问题。
    这个纱厂从今年1月初搞一条龙，迄今还不到一月，效果在钢丝、并条等工序上已很显著，超过了规定的指标。粗纱工序的问题还较多，正在积极设法解决。一条龙的效果还不仅仅表现在生产的改进上，领导干部下车间这件事本身对广大职工就是一个鼓舞。这个厂的领导干部以前是从不到车间去的，因此群众反映：“看到领导干部到车间来跑跑就高兴，不解决什么问题也没有关系。”
    现在这个厂，为了实现先进的生产指标，他们提出的近处奋斗目标是“赶上武汉国棉一厂”，远处的比赛口号是：“今年赶上上海，明年赶上青岛！”劲头很大。
    当前的问题是这种新的领导方法还没有完全巩固，从“一条龙”上取得的经验还没有普及到所有机台，形成制度。然而好处是肯定的。照记者看，一切连续生产的企业，都可以参考这个办法试一试。
    武昌第一纱厂是一个老厂。它在1916年由湖北的商业资本家李紫云等筹建，1920年投入生产。现在是公私合营。它有十万个老掉了牙的英国出产的纺锭。但是它的六千多职工，却是社会主义的新人，新的人一定能战胜旧的机器，这个工厂像一条龙一样地在奔腾着前进着。
    参观的浪潮
    要问现在武汉市和湖北省什么风最盛行，我想，恐怕要算参观的风。
    全省性的规模浩大的参观访问评比，成了生产大跃进中的一个特点。每个县的县区村干部，最近都参观过麻城、均县等地，因为这些地方农业生产先进。可是麻城的棉花，原来不仅不先进而且是落后的，落在它的邻县新洲的后面。麻城不甘于这种落后，它派了六千社员到新洲的大渡乡、刘集乡去参观，看看人家的棉花为什么长得好。这一参观把新洲的长处学来了，再加上一把干劲，于是事情就反过来，去年麻城的棉花单位面积产量超过了新洲。
    武汉的国棉一厂是一个新厂，机器设备和其它条件都好，可是这个厂的一些职工还觉得不满足，要求很高很多，干劲也不大。同时工人对干部不深入生产也有意见。于是这个工厂就组织了大批职工到勤俭办企业的襄阳棉织厂和均县的农村去参观。一比之下，就发现了自己的思想有问题。回来以后，空气大变，原来种种要求都置诸脑后了，干劲也起来了。他们用八个字形容现在的状况：满脑革命、浑身干劲。
    国棉一厂的干劲传开了，一些工厂又纷纷派人到这个厂来参观。国棉一厂的干劲又促进了别的工厂发挥干劲，像长江的波浪前推后涌，滔滔奔进。武昌第一纱厂的“一条龙”就是到国棉一厂参观后搞起来的。
    记者还听说在农村里有一种“暗参观”，也就是不通知对方，偷偷地去学别人的先进，回来加油干。以后省委知道了告诉他们：革命竞赛，大大方方公开地干，不要偷偷摸摸。现在是否还有“暗参观”，记者就不得而知了。
    “组织干部群众参观评比，比省委书记讲话有力量，收效快。”省委第一书记王任重这样向记者介绍参观的好处。无怪它会形成浪潮，它已成为一种群众路线的领导方法了。
    当记者离开武汉的那一天早晨，翻开当地报纸，看到一条消息，讲的是武汉市委和市人委组织的参观团在当天出发到农村去参观。接着我去访问了武钢的总经理李一清同志，想谈谈武钢的建设情况。刚见面他就对我说：“你幸亏今天来，明天我就要带着三百人到红安麻城去参观了。到农村里去学习革命干劲，把武钢建设的更快更好些。”武钢的钢铁将来会变成各种农业机械送到农村，促进农业的技术革命。而今天农业生产的大跃进，正在促进武钢的建设者加油。
    当天下午离开武汉来到长沙。第二天听说，湖南省八十六个县差不多有一半都派人去湖北参观去了。他们的口号是“到湖北取经”。先进的典型对社会主义事业在起着多么巨大的促进作用呵，而参观已经成为传播这种先进经验最简捷最有效的方法，这些都不需要再加什么说明了。
    夜访王任重
    目前全国各方面的工作都处在革命性的大跃进中，领导要跟上这种跃进的形势，一在于思想认识，二在于工作方法。应该说，湖北省是注意从这两个方面赶上形势的，而且是做得有成绩的。在这里，可以说是新鲜事物丛生。可是怎样使全省各级党委、各级领导干部都能带领群众迅速适应这种形势发展的要求呢？我琢磨着这个问题，想去请教省委第一书记王任重同志。
    去以前先摇了个电话。接电话的是王任重同志自己而不是他的秘书。当我们说明来意后，他的回答是：今天晚上就去他那里。在旅途中的记者能碰到如此爽快热情的领导者，自然十分高兴。
    当我们晚间在他的寓所见面时，这位看起来只有四十左右年青而精力饱满的湖北省的领导者，像他在电话中一样爽直地侃侃而谈。
    “党的二中全会以后，我们强调艰苦奋斗，领导生产。党的三中全会以后，我们强调农业大跃进。在农业跃进中注意了推广先进经验，方法是组织广泛的参观评比。这种方法见效快又省力。在以前，我们也组织过参观，但大都是小型的和技术性的。至于着眼于改进领导作风和领导方法，则是从1957年开始的。
    “看，比听比开会容易接受。看时，也听讲，但不是省委讲，而是当地的主人讲。我们有时也说几句，只是问问有什么问题。但是参观首先要党委的第一书记去，他的思想通了，事情就好办，什么都行得通。
    “高潮，对领导方法的改进有很大的推动作用，这叫做形势逼人。如果你不动，那末，乡里的支部书记就会问你：别的县八百斤、一千斤，你这个县委书记怎么不动呀？这一逼，热情就起来了。领导干部的干劲推动了群众，群众的干劲起来以后又反过来促进领导，这叫做上下左右互相推动。这次我下乡去，路上看到大粪堆上也贴着‘赛麻城，赶孝感’的标语，干劲是前所未有的。有一个县的县委书记提出‘少活十年，赶上麻城’的口号，决心倒是好，可是为什么要少活十年呢？多活十年不更好吗？我们倒是需要下决心苦战三年，把普通的水旱灾消灭，使农村的面貌得到根本改变。”
    谈到这里，王任重同志转到另一个话题：“要使农作物按照人的要求来生长”。他说：“我们现在有一种不大清楚的观念，谈到收成，总是首先谈到年景如何如何，这就是说，一切听命于自然，不相信人能叫农作物产多少就产多少。既然有的单位面积产量达到一千斤，为什么别的地方就不能一千斤呢？人的主观能动性可以做到这一点，这是符合客观条件的。麻城有个支部书记叫林世猛，一亩棉花产一千二百斤籽棉，一亩麦子产五百斤。他可以叫庄稼长多高就长多高，叫棉花结几个桃就结几个桃，这不就是证明吗？问题在于提高技术。麻城李胜乡的棉花每亩都是千斤，在那里技术已成为群众的财富了，每个社员都讲得出1957年棉花的种植还有哪些缺点，1958年应当怎么办。所以那里的棉花能丰产。”
    最后，王任重同志谈到：“这一个时期，干部群众的干劲都大，突击一下还是可以的，但要注意不要过分突击，最近有些地方的农民反映疲劳，值得注意。另外，有些城镇为了支援农村，星期日实际上已成为农业生产日，这也要适当节制一下，比方星期日劳动半天休息半天不也好吗？”
    夜已深，我们向王任重同志告别，感谢他这次有益的谈话。在归途上，我想着：在党的领导下，一场千百万群众参加的、前所未有的生产斗争的大革命，正在我们祖国大地上进行着，它的动向将必然会导向有历史意义的技术革命。　（本篇完，全文待续）
