　　Anhui Grain Department's Good Ideas to Support Agriculture
    Increase Mobile Processing Plants: Save Labor, Produce More Rice, Supply Feed Promptly
    Use Rice Husks to Process Feed: Fully Utilize Waste, Support Farmers in Raising More Pigs
    (Our dispatch from Hefei, February 1st) The Anhui Provincial Grain Department has decided to greatly increase feed processing and establish mobile grain processing plants this year to support the great leap forward in agricultural and sideline production.
    The province plans to process 800 million jin of feed this year, an eleven-fold increase compared to last year; calculated at 400 jin of feed per pig, this can feed 2 million pigs. The number of feed processing machines will be greatly increased, and each rice mill will have a feed processing workshop. At the same time, existing stone mills, hand mortars, and water mills in rural areas should be fully utilized to process feed. The main raw materials for processing are rice husks, peanut shells, and corn cobs. In Anhui Province, the rice husks left over from state rice processing alone amount to more than 700 million jin each year, and in the past, most of them were wasted except for some used as fuel. Last year, Anhui began to promote rice husk processing, grinding 80 jin of rice husks and mixing them with 20 jin of fine bran to create "unified bran," which can be used as the main feed for pigs. Each 100 jin of unified bran is worth 2.5 yuan, 40% cheaper than fine bran. This practice is very popular among the masses.
    The Anhui Provincial Grain Department will establish more than 180 mobile grain processing plants this year, converting most of the 150 fixed rice mills with 25 horsepower or less into mobile plants. In addition to processing for the state, these plants will also process grain for agricultural cooperatives. Mobile processing plants use large flatbed trucks to carry lightweight power engines (powered by charcoal or diesel), rice hullers, and two rice mills, transporting them to various grain stations or agricultural cooperatives to process rice on the spot. Last year, Anhui Province established 36 mobile processing plants in the four special districts of Lu'an, Bengbu, Wuhu, and Anqing, processing nearly 200 million jin of rice. In the past, in areas without mobile processing plants, many grain stations had to transport paddy rice to rice mills for processing into rice and then transport it back. This not only wasted labor and increased transportation costs, but also led to the concentration of large quantities of feed, resulting in a shortage of feed in rural areas and an excess of feed in cities and towns. Last year, mobile processing plants processed nearly 200 million jin of rice, saving 190,000 yuan in transportation costs, while also supplying the feed needed by rural areas in a timely manner. Processing for agricultural cooperatives can not only save rural labor, but also produce 12 liang more rice per 100 jin through machine processing compared to manual processing, and the cost of machine processing is 1.7 jiao less than manual processing.

　　安徽粮食部门支援农业的好主意
    增设流动加工厂：省劳力，多出米，供应饲料及时
    用稻壳加工饲料：充分利用废物，支持农民多养猪
    本报合肥1日电　安徽省粮食部门决定今年大量进行饲料加工和举办粮食流动加工厂，支援农副业生产大跃进。
    全省今年准备加工饲料八亿斤，比去年增加十一倍；以一头猪需要四百斤饲料计算，可供二百万头猪食用。加工饲料的机器将大为增加，每个机器碾米厂都可有一个饲料加工车间。同时要充分利用农村现有的石碾、手碓、水碓等加工饲料。加工的原料主要是稻壳和花生壳、玉米心。安徽省每年仅由国家加工大米以后留下的稻壳，就有七亿多斤，过去除了部分供作燃料外，很多都被浪费掉了。去年安徽开始推行稻壳加工，把八十斤稻壳加工磨碎以后掺入二十斤细糠成为统糠，可以作为猪的主要食料。每百斤统糠价值二元五角，比细糠便宜40％。这一作法很受群众欢迎。
    安徽省粮食部门今年要增设粮食流动加工厂一百八十多个，把一百五十个二十五马力以下的固定碾米厂大部分改为流动厂。这些厂除了为国家加工以外，还要为农业社加工粮食。流动加工厂是把轻型的动力机（用木炭或柴油开动）、砻稻机和两个碾米机用大板车或平车载着，运到各个粮站或者农业社去就地加工大米。安徽省去年在六安、蚌埠、芜湖、安庆四个专区办了三十六个流动加工厂，加工大米近两亿斤。过去没有流动加工厂的地方，许多粮站要把稻谷运到碾米厂去加工成大米再运回来。这样不仅浪费劳动力、增加运费，而且使大批饲料集中，形成农村缺乏饲料，城市、县镇饲料过多的现象。去年流动加工厂加工了近两亿斤大米，节省运费十九万元，同时及时供应了农村需要的饲料。为农业社加工，不仅可以节省农村劳动力，而且用机器加工比手工加工每百斤多出十二两米，机器加工的费用比手工加工少一角七分。　（于风）
