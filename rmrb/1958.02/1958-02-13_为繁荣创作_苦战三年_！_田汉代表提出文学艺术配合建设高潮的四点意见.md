To "Fight Hard for Three Years" to Prosper Creation!
Tian Han Representative Proposes Four Opinions on Literary and Artistic Coordination with the Construction Upsurge

Listening to the reports of Comrades Peng Zhen, Li Xiannian, Bo Yibo, and Wu Yuzhang, and the speeches of many representatives, especially those from rural areas, factories, and mines, has given me great excitement. Continuing the great blooming and contending, great rectification and improvement after the anti-Rightist struggle has further clarified the bright road of socialism, purified and strengthened the ranks of the working class, and enhanced the enthusiasm for building socialism. Therefore, it is foreseeable that a great leap forward in production will emerge, which is exactly what the people of the whole country demand. However, once the creativity and enthusiasm of the people are mobilized, they will produce such a huge material force, breaking the original, even improved, production plans every day. It truly is "breakthrough after breakthrough, progress after progress," leaving many bureaucratic and senile conservatives far behind, which we did not fully anticipate.

Here, I would like to offer a few suggestions on how to develop literature and drama to coordinate with this rapidly developing socialist construction upsurge. To prosper creation, let a hundred flowers bloom; although the forms of expression can be diverse, the socialist content should be emphasized first.

I. We must prosper creation and make it present a flourishing scene of a hundred flowers blooming. But the "hundred flowers blooming" that we require is based on the principles of socialism and patriotism, that is, the six criteria pointed out by Chairman Mao. We demand the diversity of expression forms, but first emphasize its socialist content. Socialist content is its political content, the commander and soul of the work. We cannot allow bourgeois, yellow, and harmful things to grow wildly in our ideological positions. Our policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is correct and long-term, but it has been misunderstood or distorted at home and abroad, as if fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds can coexist and prosper without principle. Even today, there are still people in the international literary and artistic circles who emphasize absolute freedom of creation and oppose the leadership of the Party; there are still people who look for dark spots in the sun, believing that writing about the bright side is embellishing reality, and only exaggerating the dark side is writing the truth; there are still people who advocate that artistic technique comes first, and demanding ideological content from works is dogmatism, formularization, and conceptualization, and so on. Even after the anti-Rightist struggle, this argument still has a market in our country. This is a countercurrent of revisionism, and we must continue to fight against it, otherwise it will seriously hinder writers and artists from correctly treating their works, thereby making it impossible to strive for the healthy development of artistic creation. The main force of writers and artists should be used to reflect the current great struggle and sing the praises of the creation and achievements of workers and peasants.

II. The positivity of themes and subjects is still an important criterion for measuring works. Today, the main force of writers and artists should be used to reflect the current great struggle and sing the praises of the gigantic creativity of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and the mythical abundance of achievements. It is a shame and a dereliction of duty for writers and artists who are fortunate enough to be in New China not to write about the unprecedented great construction work that the Chinese people are carrying out with all their strength, and to portray the infinite enthusiasm and noble qualities displayed by the people in the great leap forward in production.

We also need to write a series of historical revolutionary struggles. In those heroic struggles, there are so many great characters that can serve as our models and historical experiences that enlighten the people's fighting wisdom. It is of great benefit to let today's people know how their freedom, happiness, and beautiful life came from the countless bloodshed and sacrifices of the previous generations.

We must also continue to patiently excavate tradition, which contains the rich creation of the previous generations. So far, more than 50,000 traditional operas have been excavated in various provinces. This is truly a wealth of our nation that is worth being proud of to the world. We must carefully and creatively transform these classical treasures into spiritual food that is beneficial to the people today.

But our focus is still on creation, new creation that reflects the current struggle. The more these works there are, the more they can encourage the continued high tide of socialist construction; the more effectively they can occupy the vast ideological positions that are still being eroded by corrupt bourgeois art; the more abundant nutrition they can provide to the national professional art performance groups and the hundreds of thousands of amateur drama groups.

I think we should also put forward the slogan of "fighting hard for three years to prosper creation." Literary and artistic creation is different from industrial and agricultural production. It requires more ample time and cannot be rushed. We can plan out a two- or three-year struggle target to achieve preliminary results. After Chairman Mao published "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," it was also two or three years before works such as "The White-Haired Girl" appeared. But the current creative conditions and environment are much better than in the past. Relying on the enthusiasm of writers and artists raised in the great leap forward in production, we will surely be able to complete the task with rich achievements. Moreover, next year will be the tenth anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic of China and the fortieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, followed by the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the Party. Should not the vast number of writers and artists who have been cultivated by the Party for many years promptly dedicate their best works and performances to the Party, to the motherland, and to the people? Writers and artists should first be socialists who are close to the people and love labor; writers and artists who have received labor training will surely be able to create better works.

III. Our works are required to observe things from a socialist height and educate the people with the socialist spirit, so we cannot but require writers and artists themselves to first be socialists who are close to the people and love labor. The Party's mobilization of the vast number of writers and artists to go to rural areas, factories, and mines to engage in productive labor, to share weal and woe with workers and peasants, and to acquire the thoughts and feelings of the working class is the most brilliant measure to ensure the high quality and quantity of future artistic creation. Currently, the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the writers and artists of various associations alone have planned to send 378 people to lower levels, and more than 200 people have already reached the areas where they are to be sent. After the Spring Festival this year, all of them can go down. Including the writers and artists of the units directly under the Ministry of Culture, nearly 1,000 people will participate in productive labor and grassroots work. This is an unprecedented event! These writers and artists are determined to be students of workers and peasants, and earnestly learn production technology; at the same time, they also bring their cultural and artistic knowledge down to create with workers and peasants. We ask worker and peasant comrades to give these newly arrived and unskilled apprentices enough assistance so that they can transform themselves into true working-class literary and artistic cadres as soon as possible.

Writers and artists who remain in urban posts will also be given the opportunity to receive labor training in rotation within a few years. After a certain number of years, these trained writers and artists will surely be able to create more and better works to meet the needs of the people and change the face of the literary and dramatic circles.

Appropriate labor training opportunities should also be given to older writers who account for a large proportion. I suggest that older writers can do some light labor for a fixed time every day, instead of going down a few times a year, which is not very beneficial for transforming themselves. Promoting Mandarin does not mean canceling dialects, and local operas will exist for a long time; the phenomenon of extravagance and waste in characters and scenery should be eradicated.

IV. Dramatic creation, to a large extent, needs to address the issue of language. In the past, some ideological confusion was caused by the issue of Mandarin and dialects. When it was first proposed to use Beijing dialect as Mandarin, some local opera actors asked, "Will local operas be performed in Beijing dialect in the future? Will those who do not speak Mandarin well have to change careers?" The Guangdong South China Drama Troupe also had a debate about whether or not to cancel the Cantonese team. This time, with Comrade Zhou Enlai's speech on "The Task of Current Language Reform," the problems were all solved. Promoting Mandarin does not mean canceling dialects. When working in-depth among the local masses, one should also learn dialects. Dialects will exist for a long time, and local operas will undoubtedly exist for a long time. Its local characteristics form the diversity of Chinese opera expression forms, and some parts will gradually move towards unification.

Promoting Mandarin does not require everyone to speak authentic Beijing dialect, but of course, higher requirements are required for spoken drama. The level of Mandarin in our National Theatre is not too high at present, and we demand that it be raised to the proper height through continuous competition. Playwrights are also required to have a higher level of Mandarin. Actors often complain: "Our language is not good because the author did not write well." This is often a criticism that should be accepted. Of course, whether the dramatic language is good or not is not entirely a matter of whether the Beijing dialect is authentic or not.

Finally, the waste phenomenon in art groups mentioned in Comrade Qian Junrui's speech is very alarming. This is also related to the extravagance and waste of characters and scenery stipulated in the script to some extent. In addition to generally eradicating this bad atmosphere, writers and artists are also required to convey thought-provoking ideological content in an extremely refined and simple manner to further promote the upsurge of socialist construction!

    为繁荣创作“苦战三年”！
    田汉代表提出文学艺术配合建设高潮的四点意见
    听了彭真、李先念、薄一波、吴玉章四位同志的报告和许多代表同志特别从各地农村、工矿来的代表同志的发言，给了我极大的兴奋。在反右派斗争之后继续大鸣大放，大整大改，更认清了社会主义的光明大道，纯洁壮大了工人阶级的队伍，提高了建设社会主义的积极性，因而会出现一个生产大跃进的伟大局面是可以预见的，也正是全国人民所要求的。但是人民的创造性、积极性一经发动会产生出这样巨大的物质力量，每天都打破原定的、甚至提高了的生产计划，真是“突破又突破，前进又前进”，把许多有官气、暮气的保守主义者都远远地抛在后面，却是我们没有充分估计到的。
    这里我只就如何发展文学戏剧来配合这一日千里的社会主义建设高潮，提几点意见。要繁荣创作，百花齐放；表现形式虽可多种多样，但首先应强调社会主义内容。
    一、我们一定得繁荣创作，使它呈现百花齐放的盛况。但我们所要求的“百花齐放”是以社会主义爱国主义的原则，也就是毛主席所指出的六条标准做前提的。我们要求表现形式的多种多样，但首先强调它的社会主义内容。社会主义内容也就是它的政治内容，是作品的统帅和灵魂，我们不能让资产阶级黄色的有毒害的东西在我们思想阵地里横生怒长。我们百花齐放百家争鸣的政策是正确的，长期的，但在国内外曾一度被人误解或发生曲解，仿佛香花毒草可以无原则地共存共荣。至今国际文艺界还有人在强调创作的绝对自由，反对党的领导；还有人在太阳里面找黑斑，认为写光明是粉饰现实，只有夸张阴暗面才是写真实；还有人主张艺术技巧第一，向作品要求思想性是教条主义、公式化、概念化等等。尽管在反右派斗争之后，这种论调在我们国内还有市场。这是一股修正主义的逆流，我们必须继续跟它做斗争，否则它就要严重妨碍作家艺术家正确对待作品，从而无法争取艺术创作的健康发展。作家艺术家主要力量应用来反映当前伟大斗争，歌唱工人农民的创造和成就。二、题材主题的积极性依然是衡量作品的重要标准。在今天，作家艺术家的主要力量应该用来反映当前伟大斗争，歌唱广大工人农民巨人般的创造力，神话式的丰饶成就。有幸做新中国的作家艺术家而不写中国人民所全力进行的这一史无前例的伟大建设工作，刻划人民在生产大跃进中所表现的无限热情和崇高品质是有愧于人民的，失职的。
    我们还要写一系列历史性的革命斗争，在那些壮烈斗争中有多少足以供我们楷模的伟大性格和启发人民战斗智慧的历史经验，让今天人民知道他们的自由、幸福、美好生活是怎样从前代人民无数流血牺牲中得来的，有很大好处。
    我们也要继续耐心地挖掘传统，那里面包含前代人民丰富的创造，到现在为止各省挖掘出来的传统剧目已经超过五万多部，这真是我们民族值得向世界骄傲的财富。我们要细心地创造性地把这些古典财富化成今天人民有益的精神粮食。
    但我们的重点还是创作，新的，反映当前斗争的创作。这些作品越多就越能鼓动社会主义建设热情继续高涨；越能有效地占领还遭受资产阶级腐败艺术侵蚀的广大思想阵地；越能给国家专业艺术表演团体和数以四五十万计的业余戏剧团体以丰富的营养。
    我以为我们也应该提出“为繁荣创作苦战三年”的口号。文艺的创作不同于工农业生产，它需要有较充裕的时间，不能求成太急，我们规划出两三年的奋斗指标是可以收到初步效果的。毛主席发表“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”以后也是隔了两三年才有“白毛女”之类的作品出现的。但现在的创作条件和环境比过去好得太多了。依靠作家、艺术家在生产大跃进中提高的积极性必能以丰厚成绩完成任务。何况明年就是我们中华人民共和国建国十周年和五四运动四十周年，接着党的四十年诞日也就到了。多年来受党的培养的广大作家、艺术家不应该及时地用自己最好的作品和演出来向党，向祖国，向人民献礼吗？作家艺术家首先应该是接近人民、热爱劳动的社会主义者；受过劳动锻炼的作家艺术家一定能创造更好的作品。
    三、我们的作品既要求从社会主义高度观察事物，和以社会主义精神教育人民，那就不能不要求作家艺术家自己首先是接近人民、热爱劳动的社会主义者。党动员广大作家艺术家到农村工矿进行生产劳动锻炼，与工人农民同甘共苦，取得工人阶级的思想感情，是保证今后艺术创造高度质量与数量的最英明的措施。目前单是全国文联和各协会的作家艺术家预定下放的就有三百七十八人，已经达到下放地区的有二百多人。到今年春节后可以全部下去。连同文化部直属单位的作家艺术家在内将近千人去参加生产劳动和基层工作，这是旷古未有的盛事！这些作家艺术家决心做工人农民的学生，认真地去学习生产技术；一面也把他们掌握的文化艺术知识带下去，跟工人农民一道创造。我们要求工人农民同志给这些新来的不熟练的学徒们以足够的协助，让他们早日把自己改造成为真正工人阶级的文艺干部。
    还有留在城市岗位的作家艺术家也将在几年之内轮番受到劳动锻炼。在一定年月之后这些受过锻炼的作家艺术家一定能创造更多更好的作品来满足人民需要，改变文学戏剧界的面目。
    对于占比例不小的年纪较大的作家也应该给以适当的劳动锻炼机会。我建议年纪大的作家可以每天划一定时间做些轻微劳动，不要单是一年下去几次，那样对改造自己益处不大。推广普通话不等于取消方言，地方戏将长期存在；人物布景铺张浪费现象，应予根绝。
    四、戏剧创作在很大程度上要接触语言问题。在普通话和方言问题上，以前引起过一些思想紊乱。当开始提出以北京话为普通话的时候，有的地方剧演员曾经问“将来地方戏是不是要以北京语音演出？说不好普通话的是不是要改行呢？”广东华南话剧团也曾经有应不应取消粤语队的争论。这一次有了周恩来同志“关于当前文字改革的任务”的讲话问题就都解决了。推广普通话不等于取消方言。在深入地方群众工作时还应该学习方言。方言将是长期存在的，地方戏无疑也将长期存在。它的地方特点形成中国戏曲表现形式的多样性，有的部分也将慢慢走向统一。
    推广普通话，并不要求都说地道的北京话，但是对于话剧当然要求得严格一些。我们国家话剧院的普通话水平目前还不是太高的，我们要求通过不断比试提到应有高度。对于剧作家也要求有普通话的较高水平，演员同志常常抱怨说：“我们的语言不好，由于作者写得不好。”这常常是应该接受的责难。当然戏剧语言的好不好，还不全是北京话是否道地的问题。
    最后，钱俊瑞同志的发言中提到的艺术团体的浪费现象是十分惊人的，这在某种程度也与剧本所规定的人物布景的铺张浪费有关，除了一般地根绝这种恶劣风气之外，也要求作家艺术家以极精炼简素的手法传出震动人心的思想内容，把社会主义建设高潮更向前推进一步！
