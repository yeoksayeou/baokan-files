Must Respect Facts
Editor

The news published in this newspaper on February 8 criticizing the Ministry of Electric Power for its indifference to the reform of the Shijingshan Power Plant contained many discrepancies from the facts because the relevant reporters and editors "rushed for time" one-sidedly and did not carefully verify the facts. For the same reason, the reader's letter published in this newspaper on January 3 this year criticizing the Zhejiang leadership organs for neglecting the leadership of the Andong Salt Area was completely inconsistent with the facts and was exploited by people with ulterior motives. This is a serious lesson for us.

The purpose of publishing such critical news is to promote relevant units to quickly correct shortcomings and errors in their work so that the work can be done better. This wish is undoubtedly good. However, doing so must have a prerequisite, that is, the facts being criticized must be accurate. Because only accurate, realistic, and truth-seeking criticism can convince the criticized and help the criticized and those with similar errors and shortcomings effectively improve their work. If the criticism is inaccurate, or even fundamentally untrue, it will not only fail to promote and improve work, but will also bring losses to our cause. In this case, even the best subjective wishes can only have bad results.

Our country's various undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds, and the achievements are great and primary, but it is impossible to have no shortcomings. This situation is reflected in our newspapers, and there must be a large number of manuscripts praising and eulogizing the creative labor achievements of the people, as well as necessary manuscripts criticizing backward phenomena. Both praise and criticism are to promote and improve work. However, whether it is praise or criticism, it must be true. Do not exaggerate good things, do not embellish bad things, and do not exaggerate. This is one of the fundamental differences between our people's newspapers and bourgeois newspapers. The mistake in this newspaper's criticism of the Ministry of Electric Power and the Zhejiang leadership organs was because the relevant staff of this newspaper violated this principle.

At present, all aspects of work across the country are booming, which is reflected in the newspapers as the introduction and promotion of advanced examples, and the development of criticism and self-criticism presents an unprecedented active situation. The promoting role of newspapers in actual work is unprecedented. This is a great progress of national newspapers and is the result of all journalists giving play to revolutionary vigor under the leadership of the Party. Under such circumstances, our newspaper workers should be more modest and prudent, and whether it is a critical manuscript or a praise manuscript, they should pay more attention to verifying the facts than ever before, and strive to be accurate. The greater the influence of the newspaper, the greater the responsibility of journalists. We should learn from the mistakes in handling these two critical manuscripts, and we are willing to share this with comrades from other newspapers and periodicals.

    必须尊重事实
    编者
    本报2月8日发表的批评电力工业部对石景山发电厂的改革无动于衷的消息，因为有关的记者和编辑人员片面地“抢时间”，没有认真核对事实，结果造成与事实有不少出入。由于同样的原因，今年1月3日本报发表的批评浙江的领导机关忽视对庵东盐区的领导的读者来信，更是完全与事实不符，被用心不良的人钻了空子。这对于我们是一个严重的教训。
    发表这类批评性消息的目的，是为了促进有关单位迅速纠正工作中的缺点和错误，使工作做得更好。这种愿望无疑是好的。然而，这样做必须有一个前提，就是所批评的事实必须准确。因为只有准确的、符合实际情况的、实事求是的批评，才能使被批评者心服，才能帮助被批评者和有类似错误和缺点的人有效地改进工作。如果批评得不准确，甚至基本失实，那不仅不能推动和改进工作，反而会给我们的事业带来损失。在这种情况下，那怕再好的主观愿望，也只能得到坏的效果。
    我们国家的各项事业一日千里地前进，成绩是伟大的、主要的，但是也不可能没有缺点。这种情况反映到我们的报纸上，就必然有大量的表扬和歌颂人民群众的创造性劳动成果的稿件，也有必要的批评落后现象的稿件。表扬和批评，都是为推动和改进工作。但是，无论是表扬或者批评，都必须真实。对好的事情不夸大，对坏的事情不粉饰，也不夸大。这是我们人民的报纸同资产阶级报纸的根本区别之一。这次本报对电力工业部和浙江领导机关的批评出了错误，就是因为本报有关的工作人员违背了这个原则。
    目前全国各方面的工作都蓬蓬勃勃，这反映在报纸上就是介绍和推广先进的范例、开展批评与自我批评呈现了从来没有过的活跃情况，报纸对实际工作所起促进作用是空前的。这是全国报纸的大进步，是全体新闻工作者在党的领导下发挥革命干劲的结果。在这种情况下，我们的报纸工作者就更要谦虚谨慎，无论是批评稿件或是表扬稿件，都要比以往更加注意核对事实，力求准确无误。报纸的影响越大，新闻工作者的责任也就越大。我们应当从处理这两篇批评稿件的错误中吸取教训，并愿以此与其他报刊的同志们共勉。
