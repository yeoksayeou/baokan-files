Why?

    Why does the dish seem to shrink after adding salt?
    Anyone who has cooked before, if they pay attention, will notice this strange phenomenon: a pot full of chopped cabbage, after being boiled in plain water, will seem to shrink a bit. After sprinkling some salt, after some time, it will shrink even more. This is because raw vegetables are relatively hard and piled loosely, with many gaps in between, so they appear to be more. After being boiled in plain water, they become soft and can stick together more closely, reducing the gaps in between, which creates the illusion that they have shrunk. However, if you add a little salt, the vegetables do indeed shrink, because the vegetables originally contain a lot of moisture. The skin of the vegetable is a semi-permeable membrane. When salt is added, the water in the pot becomes salt water. The concentration of the salt water is greater than the concentration of the water inside the vegetable, so the water inside the vegetable slowly flows outwards, and the vegetable shrivels, so the vegetable becomes smaller.
    The same principle applies to pickled vegetables shrinking over time.

### 煮菜加盐后菜就变少

专栏：为什么？

    煮菜加盐后菜就变少
    凡做过菜的人只要一留心，都会注意到这样一件怪事：满满的一锅切碎了的白菜，用白水煮过以后，菜会少掉一些；撒上些盐，隔些时候，又会少去一些。这是因为生菜较硬，堆得较松，中间有许多空隙，所以显得多。用白水煮熟后就变软了，彼此能贴得紧一些，减少了中间的空隙，看起来好像是少了，其实这是一种假象。但是如果再加一点盐，菜确实是变少了，那是因为菜内本来含有许多水分，菜的表皮是一层半透膜，一加盐，锅里的水就成了盐水，盐水比菜里面的水的浓度大，这样菜里的水分便慢慢往外跑，菜也跟着瘪了下来，所以菜就变少了。
    我们腌的菜，放久后也会变少，同样是这个道理。
