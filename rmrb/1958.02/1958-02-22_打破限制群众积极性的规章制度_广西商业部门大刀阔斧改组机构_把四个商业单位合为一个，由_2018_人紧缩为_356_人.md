Editor's Note: The phenomenon of large and overlapping commercial institutions with excessive personnel is quite common and requires thorough reform. Guangxi Province merged the four commercial institutions of the Provincial Department of Commerce, the Service Department, the Provincial Cooperative Association, and the Foreign Trade Bureau, along with their affiliated provincial-level companies, into a unified leadership and accounting unit – the Department of Commerce. This reduced the staff by 82%, who were then sent down to the grassroots or to participate in agricultural production, making the regulations and systems more adapted to further enhancing mass enthusiasm. As a result, work efficiency has significantly improved. This spirit of bold innovation is worth promoting.

Of course, the specific forms taken by commercial institutions in various regions during the reforms differ. Which form or forms are more appropriate still needs to be tested in practice based on the principle of adapting to local conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, February 21st (Reporter Gong Jingzhi) reports: The commercial system of Guangxi Province, breaking with convention and with a spirit of bold revolution, has merged the four provincial-level commercial institutions—the Department of Commerce, the Service Department, the Provincial Cooperative Association, and the Foreign Trade Bureau—and their affiliated provincial-level companies into a unified leadership and accounting unit for managing the province's commercial work: the Department of Commerce (商业厅). The number of cadres has been reduced from the original 2,018 to 356, with 82% of the cadres being sent down to the grassroots or up to the mountains and down to the countryside. This approach will fundamentally change the problems of inconsistent management and large, overlapping institutions that existed in commercial work in the past. Currently, the entire province's commercial system is undergoing thorough reform in a planned and step-by-step manner.

Institutions Overlap, Leadership is Not Unified, Excessive Personnel Lead to Low Labor Efficiency

Over the past few years, the commercial system of Guangxi Province has achieved significant results in organizing material exchanges, supporting industrial and agricultural production, stabilizing market prices, and promoting socialist transformation. However, many problems also exist. Since November of last year, the vast number of employees in the commercial system, during the period of "great blooming and contending," put up tens of thousands of big-character posters, raising many opinions, and focusing on exposing the problems of large, overlapping institutions and inconsistent management within the commercial system. Since the second half of 1955, in order to promote socialist transformation and adapt to the needs of developing agricultural production after agricultural cooperativization, state-owned commerce and cooperatives emphasized the division of labor and specialization, thereby expanding the commercial network and increasing the number of employees. By the end of 1957, the number of management personnel in provincial-level commercial institutions had increased to more than 2,000, and the increase in commercial institutions and personnel below the county level also exceeded the needs of business development. For example, in the Pingluo Special District, the supply and marketing cooperative system's commercial network increased by 50% in 1956 compared to 1955, and the number of staff increased by 46%, while the total purchase and sales volume only increased by slightly more than 4%. In some areas, the number of commercial personnel increased year by year, while labor productivity decreased year by year. Taking the sales volume of the state-owned department store system in Rongxian Special District as an example, the average quota per person in 1955 was 25,000 yuan, in 1956 it was 19,000 yuan, and in 1957 it was estimated to be less than 16,000 yuan, to the point where some units could not maintain the normal expenses of the store and suffered losses. In 1957, more than half of the district supply and marketing cooperatives and a quarter of the county supply and marketing cooperatives in the province suffered serious losses, and a few state-owned commercial units also experienced losses. One of the main reasons for the losses was the large number of institutions and excessive personnel.

Due to the coexistence of multiple entities and the downward extension of each, departmentalism within the commercial system was also quite serious. There were countless instances of mutual wrangling over many issues such as commodity pricing, acceptance specifications, and allocation. To resolve these wrangling matters, official documents and telephone calls were frequently exchanged, and many issues could not be resolved in a timely manner even after being reported to the province, which greatly affected the development of commercial work and also fostered bureaucracy and officialism in leadership.

Another drawback of the coexistence of multiple entities in the commercial system was the inability to rationally use human, material, and financial resources. Because each department emphasized its own business accounting, it could not unify allocation and mutual adjustment. As a result, some personnel were idle, while others were overwhelmed; some funds were insufficient, while others were stockpiled; some warehouses were insufficient, while others were empty.

This situation in commercial work was also not conducive to strengthening unified management of the market. In terms of commodity allocation and transportation, the lack of unified planning frequently resulted in unreasonable phenomena such as one-way transportation and empty return trips, which increased commodity transportation costs.

Twisting Four Ropes into One Whip

The leading departments, such as the Provincial Department of Commerce, studied the opinions of the masses and the problems in commercial work, and were determined to reduce staffing and improve work, and mobilized the masses to study and formulate specific reform plans. During the research process, the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China gave specific instructions and assistance, which strengthened everyone's determination and confidence in thoroughly improving work. Opinions were unified, and it was decided to adopt the approach of twisting four ropes into one whip. In accordance with the spirit of the State Council's regulations on improving the commercial system, and combined with the specific conditions of the province, a reform plan was formulated.

The principles of the reform plan are four: (1) Implement the State Council's regulations on the integration of administrative management and enterprise management; (2) Management institutions should be coarser, and business institutions should be finer; (3) Commercial institutions above the county level should separate wholesale and retail to overcome the shortcomings of not being precise and detailed in operating commodities; (4) The establishment of commercial institutions below the county and city level should be divided into three levels – commercial bureaus, stores, and outlets (or distribution stores). According to this principle, after the provincial-level institutions are streamlined, some businesses will be decentralized to give play to the enthusiasm and flexibility of the lower levels.

According to the above principles, the four units of the Provincial Department of Commerce, the Service Department, the Cooperative Association, and the Foreign Trade Bureau, and their affiliated sixteen business units, were merged and reorganized into a unified leadership and accounting unit for the province's commercial work: the Department of Commerce (while retaining the names of the Provincial Cooperative Association and the Foreign Trade Bureau to the outside world). The Department of Commerce has four comprehensive departments/offices: the General Office, the Financial Accounting Department, the Planning and Statistics Department, and the Market and Price Department, as well as seven professional departments: Industrial Products, Medicine (including Chinese medicinal materials), Material Supply, Food, Food Sundries, Production Materials Daily Sundries, and Agricultural Products, as well as the Foreign Trade Bureau. In addition, five offices were established in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Wuhan, and Zhanjiang to handle the organization of goods from outside the province and the promotion of exportable local products. Two of these offices also handle foreign trade business. After this merger, the Provincial Department of Commerce will ensure the following to the Central Government: (1) Ensure acceptance of the leadership of the relevant ministries and bureaus of the Central Government and complete the work tasks assigned by the higher levels; (2) Ensure the completion of the profit submission targets of the original four units.

This reform has been widely supported by the vast number of employees in the province's commercial system and strongly supported by the party and government leaders at the special district, county, and township levels. The commercial institutions in each special district and city have already been merged and reorganized, and the commercial institutions in most counties are currently being reorganized.

Leading Cadres Grasp Business, Work Efficiency Significantly Improved

Although it has only been a little over a month since the reform, new atmospheres have already appeared in the work. First, the bureaucracy and officialism of leading cadres have been basically overcome, enabling leaders to personally manage specific businesses. The merged Department of Commerce has five directors and deputy directors, each of whom is assigned to manage the work of two to three departments, which strengthens business leadership, and the study and resolution of problems are more timely than in the past. For example, various equipment to support the current water conservancy construction is now directly controlled by the Department of Commerce. The director can promptly understand the demand and allocation situation in various places and solve problems in a timely manner, changing the shortcomings of the past, where the relevant companies were in control, reported layer by layer, delayed opportunities, and affected the work. Second, wrangling has been eliminated, the enthusiasm of cadres has soared, and work efficiency has significantly improved. For example, in previous years, due to mutual wrangling, the annual business plan could not be finalized until more than half a year had passed. After the merger, although the number of personnel was reduced, the plan for this year was finalized in January because of unified thinking and action. Now, the Department of Commerce is further mobilizing all employees to improve business management and better serve the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958.

    打破限制群众积极性的规章制度
    广西商业部门大刀阔斧改组机构
    把四个商业单位合为一个，由2018人紧缩为356人
    编者按：商业机构庞大、重叠，从业人员过多的现象相当普遍，需要彻底改革。广西省把商业厅、服务厅、省合作总社、对外贸易局四个商业机构及其所属省级公司合并成一个统一领导和统一核算单位——商业厅，减少了82％的人员下放到基层或参加农业生产，使规章制度更加适应进一步提高群众积极性的要求，结果是工作效率显著提高。这种大胆革新的精神值得提倡。
    当然，目前各地商业机构在改革中所采取的具体形式各有不同，究竟哪一种或哪几种形式比较合适，还需要根据因地制宜的原则，在实践中加以检验。
    本报特约新华社南宁21日电记者宫敬之报道：广西省商业系统打破常规，以大胆革命精神，将省级商业厅、服务厅、省合作总社、对外贸易局四个商业机构及其所属省级公司合并为管理全省商业工作的统一领导和统一核算的单位——商业厅。干部由原四个单位的二千零一十八人，紧缩为三百五十六人，有82％的干部已经下放到基层或上山下乡。这一作法，将从根本上改变过去商业工作中所存在的管理不统一，机构庞大、重叠的问题。现在全省商业系统正有计划、有步骤地进行彻底改革。
    机构重叠领导不统一  人员过多劳动效率低
    广西省商业系统几年来，在组织物资交流、支持工农业生产、稳定市场物价、促进社会主义改造等方面，取得了显著成绩。但是也存在着很多问题。自从去年11月份以来，商业系统的广大职工在大鸣大放中，贴出了成千上万张大字报，提出了许多意见，集中地揭发了商业系统机构庞大、重叠和管理不统一的问题。自1955年下半年起，为了促进社会主义改造和适应农业合作化后发展农业生产的需要，国营商业、合作社强调分工和专业化，因之扩大了商业网，增加了从业人员。省一级商业机构的管理人员，到1957年底增加到二千多人，县以下商业机构和人员的增加也超过了业务发展的需要。如平乐专区供销社系统的商业网，1956年比1955年增加50％，工作人员增长46％，而购销业务总额却只增长了4％多一些。有的地区商业人员逐年增加，而劳动生产率却逐年下降。以容县专区国营百货系统销货额统计，每人平均定额1955年为二万五千元，1956年为一万九千元，1957年估算不足一万六千元，以至有些单位不能维持商店的正常开支，发生了亏损。1957年全省有半数以上的区供销社和四分之一的县供销社发生严重的亏损，少数的国营商业单位也有亏损现象。造成亏损的主要原因之一，就是机构庞大，人员过多。
    由于多头并存，条条下伸，商业系统各部门的本位主义也就相当严重。在商品作价、验收规格、调拨等很多问题上互相扯皮的事情数不胜数，为了解决扯皮的事情，经常是公文旅行，电话来往，不少问题一直反映到省里还不能及时解决，大大地影响了商业工作的开展，也助长了领导上的事务主义和官僚主义作风。
    商业系统多头并存的另一缺点，是人力、物力、财力不能合理使用。由于各部门强调自己的经营核算，就不能统一调拨，互相调剂，结果有的人员闲着，有的则忙不过来；有的资金不够用，有的却积压；有的仓库不够，有的则在空闲着。
    商业工作的这种状况，也不利于加强对市场的统一管理。在商品的调拨运输方面，也因缺乏统一筹划，经常发生单程运输、往返放空的不合理现象，增加了商品运输费用。
    把四条绳拧成一条鞭
    省商业厅等领导部门研究了群众的意见和商业工作中的问题，决心紧缩编制，改进工作，并发动群众研究制定具体改革方案。在研究过程中，中共广西省委予以具体指示和帮助，使大家加强了彻底改进工作的决心和信心，意见遂统一起来，决定采取将四条绳拧成一条鞭的作法，并根据国务院关于改进商业体制规定的精神，结合本省具体情况，制定了改革方案。
    改革方案的原则有四条：（一）贯彻执行国务院关于行政管理与企业管理合一的规定；（二）管理机构粗一些，业务机构细一些；（三）县以上的商业机构，批发与零售分开，以克服经营商品不精不细的缺点；（四）县市以下商业机构的设置分三级——商业局、商店、门市部（或分销店）。依照这个原则，省级机构紧缩后，下放一部分业务，以发挥下边的积极性和灵活性。
    根据以上原则，省商业厅、服务厅、合作总社、对外贸易局四个单位及所属的十六个企业单位，合并改组为全省商业工作的统一领导与统一核算的单位——商业厅（对外仍保留省合作总社及对外贸易局名义）。商业厅下设有办公室、财务会计、计划统计、市场物价处四个综合处、室，和工业品、医药（包括中药材）、物资供应、食品、食品杂货、生产资料日用杂品，农产品等七个专业处以及对外贸易局，另在上海、广州、北京、武汉、湛江设办事处五个，分别办理省外货源组织以及外销土产的推销工作，其中有两个办事处兼负对外贸易业务。这样合并以后，省商业厅对中央要作到：（一）保证接受中央各有关部、局的领导，完成上级所交给的工作任务；（二）保证完成原四个单位的上交利润指标。
    这种改革，已经获得全省商业系统广大职工的普遍拥护和专区、县、乡各级党政领导的大力支持，现在各专区、市的商业机构已经合并改组，大部分县的商业机构，正在改组中。
    领导干部掌握业务  工作效率显著提高
    从改革到现在虽然只有一个多月，但是工作上已经出现了新气象。首先是基本上克服了领导干部的事务主义和官僚主义，使领导能够亲自掌管具体业务。合并后的商业厅有正副厅长五人，他们每人分工掌管两个到三个处的工作，这样就加强了业务领导，研究和解决问题都比过去及时了。如支援当前水利建设的各种器材，已由商业厅直接掌握，每天各地的需求调拨情况，厅长能及时了解，及时解决问题，改变了过去由有关公司掌握，层层上报，延误时机，影响工作的缺点。其次，扯皮现象消除了，干部的工作积极性空前高涨，工作效率有了显著的提高，如往年因互相扯皮，每年的业务计划过了半年多还订不出来，合并后虽然人员减少，但因思想步调统一，今年的计划在1月份就订出来了。现在商业厅正在进一步发动全体职工，改善经营管理，更好的为1958年工农业生产大跃进服务。
