Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 15th: TASS, Paris, February 15th: The funeral of Marcel Cachin, an outstanding activist of the French and international workers' movement, was solemnly held on the afternoon of the 15th.

　　From early morning, tens of thousands of working people from all over France streamed to pay their last respects to Cachin. When Cachin's coffin was moved out of the editorial department of "l'Humanité", tens of thousands of Parisians gathered at the entrance of the editorial department. A row of guards of the Republic in dress uniforms stood solemnly in front of the newspaper office. At 2:30 p.m., French National Assembly Speaker Le Troquer, accompanied by members of parliament from various parties, bid farewell to Cachin.

　　Subsequently, Cachin's coffin, covered with the red flag and the French national flag, was moved out of the "l'Humanité" office and placed on the hearse. The Guards of the Republic paid the highest military salute to Cachin.

　　A memorial service was held when the hearse arrived at the Père Lachaise Cemetery. Fajon, member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party Central Committee and Deputy Director of "l'Humanité", and Duclos, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, spoke successively.

　　In his speech, Fajon said that the French Communist Party had lost an outstanding founder, the oldest and most loyal activist of the Party. Cachin's death made the entire working class, all of France, and the entire international workers' movement sad.

　　In his speech, Duclos said that Cachin's life was full of labor, struggle, hardship, and hope, and he dedicated his life to the great cause of communism. Cachin's image will always live in people's hearts. His diligent life, loyal to his ideals, will illuminate the path of many young men and women in France.

　　After the memorial service, the Paris Municipal Transport Workers' Orchestra played "La Marseillaise" and the proletarian "Internationale."

　　Cachin's coffin was finally moved to the cemetery and placed in front of his huge portrait. Until late at night, French working people continued to come to Cachin's coffin to pay their respects.
