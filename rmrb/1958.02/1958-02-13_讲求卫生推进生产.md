    Emphasizing Hygiene Promotes Production
    Yao Di

    The patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests has been launched in most regions and units, but some production units have encountered resistance. The heads of these units have a resistant attitude towards carrying out the patriotic health campaign. They believe that production is already very tight, and there is no time for this. Some factory leaders think that production is a hard task that must be completed; hygiene work is a soft task, and it doesn't matter if it is completed or not. In short, these people see the health campaign and production work as opposing each other. Therefore, they believe that doing hygiene work will inevitably affect production. Some people use the official jargon of "Who is responsible for not completing the production task?" to threaten those who advocate doing hygiene work; others simply do not mobilize the masses to do a good job in hygiene. The person in charge of the Beijing Public-Private Joint Venture Dongsi Electroplating Factory had this kind of thinking. The Dongsi District Anti-epidemic Station's Factory Hygiene Team found that the factory's hygiene situation was not good, so they sent people to inspect it and advised them to start work quickly. But they ignored it and still did not move. Then the hygiene team went to the factory twice more, repeatedly explaining the benefits of hygiene. However, no matter how many words were spoken, they could not move the heart of the person in charge of the factory, and they still ignored it and did not mobilize the masses. One cadre in charge of personnel work even said, "We just won't do it, you can call the mayor!" The district had no choice but to report the situation to the Municipal People's Committee. As a result, a deputy mayor of the Municipal People's Committee personally came to help clean up and educate them. Only then did they panic, realize that hygiene was really beneficial, and start to do hygiene work.

    Perhaps some people will say, "As long as the production task is completed, what's the big deal if the hygiene work is not done well! It won't affect production." Then, let's take a look at the situation in this factory. There are seventy-three workers in the factory, and six of them have lung disease, which is a relatively large percentage. Because the factory does not care about the workers' hygiene, the workers have to operate in a very bad environment, and people with and without disease eat together. May I ask, how can we ensure that other people will not get lung disease? Furthermore, if many people are sick, how can we guarantee the attendance rate and how can we guarantee the completion of the production task? Therefore, we say that doing a good job in hygiene will not only not affect production, but also promote production. The Local State-owned Shanghai Yeast Factory is a more powerful illustration of this issue, because it has paid attention to eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene, which has promoted production development. This factory also did not pay attention to hygiene in the past. Many employees got sick, and the attendance rate was not high; the product quality was also very poor. Many products had mold, bacteria, and often found garbage, small insects, and even flies. In 1955, there were 30 to 40 tons of returned goods, and users and consumers had many opinions. However, starting in the spring of the year before last, the leading cadres of this factory have always attached importance to the leadership of hygiene work, in addition to mobilizing the entire factory to eliminate the four pests, and also helped the masses establish various hygiene systems. As a result, environmental hygiene was improved. From the first quarter to the third quarter of last year, the employee morbidity rate and absenteeism rate due to illness decreased by an average of 16.6% and 8.9% compared with the same period of the year before last, and the product quality also increased by an average of more than 10% compared with the year before last. Please, those who say that production and hygiene are contradictory, come and see this fact!

    Of course, advocating doing a good job in hygiene does not mean asking everyone to put down production and focus on hygiene, so that it really affects production. That approach is also one-sided. What we advocate is to do a good job in hygiene under the condition of not affecting production, to achieve that production and hygiene are not delayed, and to promote production by doing a good job in hygiene. Therefore, the problem is not whether there is a contradiction between production and hygiene, but how to reasonably arrange time and take effective measures, so as to both do a good job in production and clean hygiene, and make hygiene work regularized, and further promote production. This requires the leading comrades of all units to attach importance to this work, mobilize the masses to think of ways, and strengthen specific organization and leadership.

    讲求卫生推进生产
    姚堤
    以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动已经在大多数地区和单位展开，但是在有些生产单位却遇到阻力。这些单位的负责人对开展爱国卫生运动有抵触情绪，他们认为生产挺紧张，哪有时间搞这些。有些厂的领导干部则认为，生产是硬任务非完成不行；卫生工作是软任务，完成完不成没有多大关系。总之，这些人把开展卫生运动和生产工作看成是对立的。因而，他们认为搞卫生必然影响生产，有的人就打“完不成生产任务谁负责”的官腔来威胁主张搞卫生的人；有的人就根本不去发动群众搞好卫生工作。北京市公私合营东四电镀厂的负责人就有过这种思想。东四区防疫站工厂卫生组发现该厂卫生情况不好，就派人去进行检查，并且劝导他们赶快动起手来。但是他们不理睬，仍旧不动。接着这个卫生组又去该厂两次，再三讲解讲卫生的好处。可是，任凭万语千言还打不动该厂负责人的心，他们仍旧置之不理，不去发动群众。其中一个做人事工作的干部甚至说，我们就是不搞，你们叫市长来好了。区里没有办法，只好把情况反映到市人民委员会。结果真的市人民委员会的一个副市长亲自上门，帮助打扫，对他们进行了教育。他们这才慌了，才认识到讲卫生真有好处，才把卫生工作搞起来。
    也许有人要说，只要完成了生产任务，卫生工作搞不好有什么大不了的！也不会影响生产。那末，我们就来看看这个厂子的情况，厂里共有七十三个工人，其中倒有六个患肺病的，占的百分比相当大。由于厂子里不关心工人的清洁卫生，工人们只好在空气很坏的环境里进行操作，有病的人和没有病的人混在一起吃饭。试问这样下去，能保证其他的人不患上肺病吗？再进一步想一想，很多人都有病了怎么能保证出勤率，又怎么能保证生产任务的完成呢？因此，我们说，搞好卫生工作不但不会影响生产，而且还会推进生产。地方国营上海酵母厂就是由于注意了除四害讲卫生，才促进了生产发展，这个事例更有力地说明了这个问题。这个厂子过去也是不讲卫生的，职工得病的很多，出勤率不高；产品质量也很差，不少产品中有霉菌、细菌，还经常发现垃圾、小虫甚至苍蝇等，1955年就有三、四十吨的退货，用户和消费者意见很多。但是，从前年春天开始，这个厂的领导干部就一直重视对卫生工作的领导，除动员全厂除四害外，并且帮助群众建立了各项卫生制度。结果，改善了环境卫生，去年第一季度到第三季度，职工发病率和因病缺勤率比前年同时期平均降低了16.6％和8.9％，产品质量也比前年平均提高了10％以上。请那些说生产和卫生有矛盾的人都来看看这个事实吧！
    当然，提倡搞好卫生工作，并不是叫大家放下生产去专搞卫生，以致于真正影响了生产，那样的做法也是片面的。我们提倡的是，在不影响生产的条件下去搞好卫生，要做到生产、卫生两不误，而且要通过搞好卫生，推进生产。因此，问题不在于生产和卫生有无矛盾，而在于如何合理安排时间和采取有效措施，以便做到既搞好生产，又清洁卫生，而且使卫生工作经常化，进一步来推进生产。这就要求各单位的领导同志重视这一工作，发动群众想办法，加强具体的组织领导。
