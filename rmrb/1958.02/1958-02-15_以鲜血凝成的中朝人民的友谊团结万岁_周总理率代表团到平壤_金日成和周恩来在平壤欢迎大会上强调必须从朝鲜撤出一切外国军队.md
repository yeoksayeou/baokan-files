Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out: "If it were not for the US imperialist aggression against Korea, our country would have been unified long ago, and our people would have been saved from the misfortune of national division. Only when the US aggressor troops withdraw from South Korea can the lasting peace of Korea be guaranteed, and our peaceful reunification of Korea can be realized." He resolutely said: "The US aggressors have absolutely no basis or excuse to station their troops in South Korea. They should and must withdraw from Korea."

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai said that the various proposals recently put forward by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea not only reflect the national aspirations of the entire Korean people, but also open up new realistic avenues for easing tensions in the Far East.

We resolutely demand that the United States and other relevant countries participating in the United Nations forces also respond to the proposal of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, withdraw their troops from South Korea, and create favorable conditions for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the easing of the Far East situation. Premier Zhou Enlai said with full confidence: "Korea, with its three thousand miles of beautiful mountains and rivers, will surely be completely unified.
