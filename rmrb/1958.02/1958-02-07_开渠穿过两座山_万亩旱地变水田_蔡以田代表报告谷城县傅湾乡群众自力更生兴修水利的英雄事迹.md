　　I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft 1958 National Budget," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Draft 1958 National Economic Plan," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," and Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee Wu Yuzhang's "Report on Current Language Reform Work and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme." I would now like to give the congress a brief introduction to the issue of converting dry land into paddy fields in Fuwan Township.

　　Our Fuwan Township is located thirty li west of Gucheng County, Hubei Province, on the southwest bank of the lower reaches of the Nanhe River, in a semi-mountainous and semi-plain area. The soil in the township is mostly yellow and white clay, oil sand, mixed sand, and stony soil. The climate is mild, and rainfall is abundant. Crops planted are mainly rice and wheat. However, the water supply is insufficient. Every time when wheat is harvested and rice seedlings are transplanted, the canals dry up. Therefore, water disputes have been frequent throughout history, even leading to fatalities.

　　Yet, the abundant Nanhe River water around our township was being wasted. The local people had long wanted to build a large canal to divert the Nanhe River water for irrigation, but before liberation, people were not united, and no one organized it, so the desire to harness the Nanhe River was never realized. In the early days after liberation, the local people also wanted to build this large canal, but again, because they were not organized and lacked funds, it was still not done. For a long time, the masses could only watch the torrents of the river flow eastward, sighing, "The Nanhe River cannot save the fields!"

　　However, in this great leap forward in agriculture, we have solved this problem that has not been solved for many years. Last September, the township convened a joint meeting of branch secretaries and cooperative directors, conveyed the instructions of the Central Committee and the State Council on building water conservancy projects, and called for well digging and canal construction. We decided to build a large canal more than twenty li long from the upper reaches of the Nanhe River to the front of our village to divert river water and expand the irrigated area. After the meeting, we surveyed the canal and mobilized the people. The masses of the township unanimously expressed their support. Then we started construction. More than 60 percent of the people in the township participated in the canal construction every day. Everyone was very enthusiastic. When we encountered cliffs, we cut through the mountains; when we encountered depressions, we filled them with earth. We never stopped working, whether it was day or night, raining or snowing. For example, shortly after construction began, we encountered a mountain. In some places, people could not stand firm; at the bottom of the mountain, there was a pool of water several meters deep, and a fall would be fatal. The cooperative members came up with a plan to build a canal on the hillside to divert the water over the mountain. For safety, iron stakes were driven into the mountain, and people were tied with ropes before being lowered down to drill holes and set off explosives. This allowed the canal to pass through the mountain quickly.

　　Then we encountered another cliff. This cliff was higher and wider than the first mountain. The cooperative members knew that it was impossible to pass through by building a canal on the hillside. Therefore, everyone decided to dig four eight-zhang-deep wells on the top of the mountain, and then dig from the four points towards the middle, cutting through the cliff to allow the water to flow over the mountain. In this way, we smoothly passed the canal through the second cliff.

　　Another relatively good situation is that in the past, government loans were sought for water conservancy construction, but this year, no government loans were needed. The cooperative members in our area put forward a slogan: "Poor areas should use poor methods to change the poor face." We tried to do everything without spending money or spending as little money as possible. When we started building the canal, we estimated that we would need 50 tons of steel bars, 150 tons of cement, 10,000 jin of explosives, and some tools for opening mountains, totaling 210,000 yuan. After discussion by the cooperative members, everyone disagreed with spending so much money. Therefore, everyone offered ideas and found ways: using kudzu vines and bamboo poles as steel bars, using yellow earth as cement, using dry cattle dung and pig hair to replace part of the explosives, and collecting waste iron from the cooperative members to make pointed hoes. As a result, we only spent 25,000 yuan, saving a large amount of funds.

　　We originally planned to complete this large canal before the Spring Festival, but thanks to the high wisdom and production enthusiasm of the vast number of cooperative members, it was completed more than twenty days ahead of schedule. We also built a 47-meter-wide and 2,000-meter-long dam and opened a 426-meter-long mountain tunnel. In addition, we filled in more than 20 mu of river beach land. In total, these projects can transform more than 10,000 mu of land in the township into paddy fields, of which all the dry land in our New Life Cooperative can be turned into paddy fields or irrigated land. The threat of drought has been basically eliminated. Our long-standing wish has been realized. This shows that only in the new society led by the Communist Party and the People's Government, only by organizing, can such arduous tasks be accomplished. Therefore, when the canal was opened to water, the masses composed a clapper rhyme and spread it everywhere: "River beach turns into fertile fields, barren mountains turn into good mountains; everyone works harder, happiness is in sight."

　　At present, the Chinese people have successfully completed the first Five-Year Plan and are implementing the larger-scale second Five-Year Plan We all know that the task before us is to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industries, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in about fifteen years. In order to achieve this task, we must vigorously develop agriculture while giving priority to the development of heavy industry. Therefore, our cooperative has formulated a ten-year long-term plan in the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program. We strive to increase grain production by more than double this year, cotton production by three times, and oilseed production by two times. We have full confidence in achieving this plan. Because the production increase measures we have taken are reliable. That is: in addition to using the canal water to expand the irrigated area, we must also vigorously accumulate fertilizer, striving to increase the actual fertilizer application by 135.29 percent compared to last year, reclaim 3,000 mu of wasteland, and further reform agricultural technology and improve agricultural implements.

　　Currently, the cooperative members in our cooperative are vigorously transforming fields, accumulating fertilizer, strengthening wheat field management, and preparing for wasteland reclamation in accordance with this plan, striving to achieve this plan.

### 开渠穿过两座山　万亩旱地变水田  蔡以田代表报告谷城县傅湾乡群众自力更生兴修水利的英雄事迹

　　开渠穿过两座山　万亩旱地变水田
    蔡以田代表报告谷城县傅湾乡群众自力更生兴修水利的英雄事迹
    我完全同意李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”、薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”、彭真副委员长“关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”和中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”。我现在仅将傅湾乡旱田改水田的问题向大会作一介绍。
    我们傅湾乡位于湖北省谷城县西三十华里，南河下游的西南岸，是一个半山半平原的地区。全乡土质多为黄、白粘土、油沙、夹沙和石渣子土地，气候温和，雨量充沛，种植作物，历年以稻、麦为主。但是，水量不足。每到拔麦和插秧时，水渠就发生枯竭现象。因此，在历史上经常闹水利纠纷，甚至发生人命事件。
    而在我们乡的周围有一条水量充沛的南河水却白白浪费掉了。当地群众很早就想修条大渠，将南河水引来灌溉，但是，解放前，人心不齐，也没人组织，治理南河的愿望从未实现；解放初期，当地群众也想修这条大渠，又因没有组织起来，缺乏资金，仍没治理。长期以来，群众只好望着那滔滔的河水向东流去，发出叹息的声音：“南河水救不了田！”
    可是，在这次农业大跃进中，我们却把这多少年来没解决的问题解决了。去年九月，乡里开支部书记和社长联席会议，传达中央和国务院关于兴修水利的指示，号召打井修渠。我们就决定由南河上游到我们村前修一条二十多里长的大渠，将河水引来，扩大灌溉面积。会后，我们勘察了渠道，又作了动员。全乡群众都一致表示拥护。接着就动工了。全乡每天有百分之六十以上的人参加修渠运动，大家干劲非常足，遇见悬崖就辟山，遇见洼地就垫土，无论黑天白日，下雨或降雪从未停工。比如开工后不久遇见一个山头，有的地方人们站不住脚；山头下边还有一个几丈深的积水潭，一失足就有淹死的危险。社员们就献计策，在山腰开渠，将水引过山去，为了安全起见，在山上打上铁椿，先用绳子将人拴上，然后系下来，打炮眼放炸药。这样便使水渠很快通过了这座山头。
    接着又遇到了一座悬崖。这一座悬崖比第一座山头又高又宽。社员们知道：在山腰修渠根本没法通过。于是，大家就决定在山顶上打四眼八丈深的井，然后由四处往两头挖，将悬崖打通，使水流过山去。这样，我们又使水渠顺利地通过了第二座悬崖。
    另外还有一个较好的情况，这就是往年兴修水利都找政府贷款，今年兴修水利都不要政府贷款了。我们那里社员们提出一个口号：“穷地区，要用穷办法，改变穷面貌”。办一切事情都打不花钱或少花钱的主意。我们开始修渠时，计算需要钢筋五十吨、水泥一百五十吨、炸药一万斤，还有开山用的一些工具等，共计需要花二十一万元。经过社员们讨论，都不同意花那么多钱。于是，大家便从多方面献计策，想办法：用葛藤和竹杆当钢筋、用黄土当水泥、用干牛粪和猪毛代替一部分炸药，收集社员们的废铁打尖镢。结果一计算，我们只花了二万五千元，节省了大批资金。
    我们原计划这条大渠要到春节前修完，由于广大社员们发挥了高度的智慧和生产积极性，结果提前二十多天就完成了。而且还修了一个四十七公尺宽、二千公尺长的一个拦河坝，打通了一个四百二十六公尺长的大山洞。另外，还垫河滩地二十多亩。总计这些工程，可以使全乡改田一万多亩，其中我们新生活社的旱田可以全部变成水田或水浇地。基本上消灭了旱灾的威胁。我们多少年来的愿望实现了。这说明只有共产党和人民政府领导的新社会，只有组织起来，才能办到这样艰巨的事情。因此，当大渠通水的时候，群众编出一首快板到处传颂：“河滩变良田，秃山变良山；大家加油干，幸福在眼前”。
    目前，我国人民已经胜利完成了第一个五年计划，正在执行规模更大的第二个五年计划。我们都知道：摆在我们面前的任务，就是在十五年左右的时间内将我国建设成为一个现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家。为了实现这个任务就必须在优先发展重工业的基础上同时大力发展农业。因此，我们社根据全国农业发展纲要的精神已订出十年远景规划。争取今年粮食要增加一番还要拐一弯，棉花增加三番，油料增加二番。我们是有充分信心实现这一计划的。因为我们采取的增产措施是可靠的。这就是：除了运用大渠水利扩大灌溉面积以外，还要大力积肥，争取实际用肥量比去年增加百分之一百三十五点二九，开荒三千亩，并进一步改革农业技术和改良农具。
    目前，我们社里的社员们正在根据这一规划，大力改田、积肥，加强麦田管理和准备开荒，为实现这一规划而奋斗。
