    Trying to Cover Up
    The fact that France used American planes to bomb peaceful villages in Tunisia shows that the American rulers are at least accomplices in France's crimes. American newspapers also point out that Washington cannot shirk its responsibility.
    However, Dulles still wanted to quibble. At a press conference on the 11th, he deliberately mystified the issue, talking at length about how the origin of France's American-made weapons was a very complex matter. He wanted people to believe that, although the United States had supplied France with a lot of military equipment under various guises, the planes France used to bomb Tunisia were not necessarily the planes the US gave them for use in this regard.
    What does Dulles' sophistry prove? He is actually saying: "The murder weapon used by the murderer was given to him by me. I gave him many murder weapons, but the murder weapon used by the murderer this time was not specifically given to him for the purpose of killing this person." Dulles' statement can only further prove that the United States is not just an ordinary accomplice of the French colonialists.

    欲盖弥彰
    法国用的是美国飞机对突尼斯和平村庄进行轰炸，这说明美国统治者在法国的罪行中至少是个帮凶。美国的报纸也指出华盛顿无法推卸罪责。 
    但是杜勒斯还想进行狡赖，他在11日举行的记者招待会上故弄虚玄，大谈什么法国的美制武器的来源是个非常复杂的问题。他要人相信，美国虽然在各种名目下供给了法国许多军火，但是法国用来轰炸突尼斯的飞机并不一定是美国给他在这方面使用的飞机。
    杜勒斯这种诡辩能说明什么问题呢？他实际是说：“凶手行凶的凶器是我给他的，我给了他许多凶器，而凶手这次所用的凶器并不是我专门给他杀害这个人用的”。杜勒斯的这段口供只能更加证明，美国并不仅是法国殖民者的一个普通的帮凶而已。
