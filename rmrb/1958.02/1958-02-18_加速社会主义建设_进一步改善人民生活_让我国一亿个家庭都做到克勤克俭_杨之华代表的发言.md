Accelerate Socialist Construction and Further Improve People's Livelihoods
Let 100 Million Families in Our Country Practice Diligence and Frugality
Speech by Representative Yang Zhihua
Vast Numbers of Women Exert Revolutionary Zeal and Actively Participate in the Production Increase and Thrift Campaign

I fully endorse the various reports of the Congress.

Encouraged by the great call of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to catch up with or surpass Britain in the production of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer, and at the same time, to make our country a world leader in high yields per unit area in agriculture, the broad masses of women, through conscientious study and debate, have raised their awareness, broadened their horizons, seen the glorious and brilliant prospects of socialism, and clarified their goals. With unprecedentedly high labor enthusiasm, they have exerted revolutionary zeal and plunged into the torrent of the great leap forward in socialist construction from all directions. The vast numbers of female workers actively participated in the production increase and thrift campaign and the socialist competition, comparing themselves to the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and enthusiastically launching competition between workshops and between groups, doing everything possible to find shortcuts, tap potential, and strive to overfulfill the tasks for 1958. In order to realize the great leap forward in agricultural production, the broad masses of rural women actively participated in winter production and plunged into the earth-shattering, vigorous movement of water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, elimination of the four pests, winter field management, and afforestation. According to materials from thirteen provinces and municipalities and forty-eight counties, the labor attendance rate of women participating in winter production was between 80 and 90 percent, and in some agricultural cooperatives, 100 percent of the female labor force participated in the movement. They were determined, resourceful, and had a high attendance rate, and the division of labor and cooperation between men and women was good, and they worked very well. They said, "Fear neither heaven nor earth, resolutely complete water conservancy," "Go out with a manure basket, picking up as much as possible, and if there is no manure, pick up a basket of grass clippings." In the soil and water conservation work in Wushan County, Gansu Province, 80 percent of the work was undertaken by women, and the division of labor between men and women was also very reasonable. They said, "Men with hoes, women with small hoes, young and middle-aged people on steep slopes, women and children on gentle slopes, men digging pits and carrying soil, women planting trees and watering."

Correct Understanding of Frugal Housekeeping

If the big river has water, the small river will have water; only if the country and the collective have wealth, will the family have wealth; it can promote production, save expenses, and raise awareness.

Through socialist debates, mutual enlightenment and education, the broad masses of women have further recognized the significance of frugal housekeeping, and have a more correct understanding of the relationship between love for the country, love for the collective, and love for the family. They said, "If the big river has water, the small river will have water; only if the country and the collective have wealth, will the family have wealth." "Increasing production and practicing thrift is loving the country, and frugal housekeeping is praised by everyone." "Don't forget the suffering of lean years in times of abundance, don't forget the hardship of hunger in times of satiety." In various places, after implementing the policy of building the country and managing households diligently and thriftily among the masses on the basis of the socialist education movement, three major benefits have been clearly seen: First, it has promoted the development of production and increased the income of commune members; second, it has established a habit of thrift, accumulated funds, and some farmers have begun to plan their household expenses and save food and cotton cloth; third, it has raised the awareness of commune members and strengthened their patriotic awareness. For example, in Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province, the attendance rate of women has generally increased, they have actively participated in agricultural and sideline production, increased the raising of 1,980 pigs, developed 343 types of sideline businesses, and increased income by 116,068 yuan. In terms of savings, according to incomplete statistics from three townships, commune members saved 78,131 jin of grain simply by reducing the amount of sugar boiling and winemaking. Some communes have also established a grain reserve system on the basis of planned grain consumption. According to statistics from another eight townships, a total of 114,100 yuan was saved and 137,270 yuan was invested in the commune through planned expenditures. The number of households with overdrafts has been greatly reduced. The commune members' ideas of loving the country and loving the commune have also improved. For example, the Victory Cooperative originally owed the state a loan of 15,000 yuan and only planned to repay half of it. After arranging their lives, the loan has been fully repaid. The Xintang District originally recognized the purchase of 10,540 yuan of public bonds, and after starting the diligent and frugal housekeeping campaign, they purchased an additional 5,140 yuan.

After debates in various places, the erroneous idea of simply relying on the state, which existed among farmers, such as "thousands of households become one family, if you don't have enough to eat or wear, go to the state," has been greatly overcome; some phenomena of not making long-term plans and not paying attention to saving have been significantly changed, and a large number of activists in diligent and frugal housekeeping have emerged among the masses. According to statistics from Lushan County, Henan Province, in November 1957, a total of 1,549 models of diligent and frugal housekeeping, 2,302 households of livestock and poultry breeding models, 4,712 grain saving models, and 3,717 "five-good" activists emerged in the county. Under the leadership of advanced figures, most of the farmers in the county have formulated plans for diligent and frugal housekeeping.

The Principle of Frugality Must Be Deeply Promoted

Only when thousands of households establish a frugal atmosphere can socialist construction be further accelerated.

However, the work of promoting and implementing the principles of building the country and managing households diligently and thriftily is not yet widespread and in-depth in various places, and various different understandings and interpretations have been encountered in the publicity. Therefore, we must further publicize the principles of building the country and managing households diligently and thriftily.

As everyone knows, building the country diligently and thriftily is the fundamental policy for building socialism. The spirit of diligence and frugality must be implemented in production, work, all undertakings, and family life. Frugal housekeeping is for the sake of building the country diligently and thriftily, for the sake of building socialism, and for the sake of further developing production and improving people's lives. We must not only implement the policy of building the country and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, actively participate in production and various construction undertakings, develop industrial and agricultural production, and increase people's income, but also manage households diligently and thriftily. Because the family is not only a consumption unit of society, but also, at present, rural families, to a certain extent, still play a certain auxiliary role in the production of cooperatives. Only when thousands of households are diligent and frugal can the atmosphere of diligence and frugality be established and consolidated in society. If the family can be diligent and frugal, it will be beneficial to the individual, the family, the country, and future generations. Our country has more than 100 million families, and the slightest increase in production and savings in each family can increase the country's enormous wealth; similarly, if more than 100 million families are slightly wasteful, it will cause huge losses to the country. And the country's increase or decrease in income, in the final analysis, has a decisive effect on the increase or decrease in the income of each family. Therefore, frugal housekeeping is a major issue related to the correct handling of the personal and national, current and long-term interests of the people, and is not an insignificant trivial matter of housework. Some people believe that advocating frugal housekeeping is to make the masses "live a hard life," which is an incorrect understanding. Our current advocacy of frugal housekeeping is based on the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of the people's lives nationwide. The purpose is not only to solve some temporary difficulties, let alone to lower the current living standards and restrict the people from improving their lives, but to lay a more solid foundation for accelerating socialist construction and further improving the lives of the people nationwide on the basis of continuing to develop production.

Our current advocacy of frugal housekeeping and the social environment in which the working people practiced frugal housekeeping in the old society are essentially different. In a society ruled by the exploiting classes, the working people, despite their diligence and frugality throughout their lives, still could not escape poverty. In a socialist society, our advocacy of frugal housekeeping can certainly achieve the goal of common prosperity on the basis of common labor. We must inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of diligence and thrift of our working people, resolutely take the socialist road to common prosperity, and never take the capitalist road of harming others to benefit oneself and individuals getting rich.

The Frugal Goals of Women in All Industries

Rural women: Actively participate in agricultural and sideline occupations and household labor, and make reasonable arrangements for the three.

Urban housewives: Be diligent in household labor, carry out service-oriented mutual assistance labor under leadership, and carry out appropriate sideline labor.

Female workers: Not only do a good job in their positions, but also actively participate in household labor.

We advocate hard work and strict economy. It is hoped that rural women will be diligent in actively participating in agricultural labor, sideline labor, and household labor according to the needs of the cooperative, and make reasonable arrangements for the three. We advocate that urban housewives should arrange their family life well, be diligent in household labor, carry out service-oriented labor mutual assistance under leadership, and appropriately engage in some family sidelines under the need to obey the urban production plan. Among female workers, it is advocated that they should not only do a good job in production and work, but also practice diligent and frugal housekeeping. Taking care of household chores and participating in social labor are equally glorious labor. Managing household chores and managing the family is of great social significance. In history, household labor has always been indispensable for maintaining and developing social production and for the survival and prosperity of the nation. In socialist society, household labor is even more socially significant and is an indispensable part of socialist construction. However, our advocacy of respecting household labor does not mean that women who are employed should return to their families, but requires them to not only do a good job in their positions, but also actively participate in household labor. Some people think that advocating frugal housekeeping is to let women return to their families, which is actually a misunderstanding or distortion.

Due to the different situations and needs of each family, the specific requirements and methods of diligence and thrift should be adapted to the time, place, and people. The slogan of implementing diligent and frugal housekeeping in Fengli Cooperative, Malou Township, Lushan County, Henan Province, is four comparisons and four competitions: compare labor and compete for reasonable division of labor; compare saving grain and cloth and compete for a good life; compare raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer and compete for collecting substitute foods; compare respecting mothers-in-law and loving daughters-in-law and compete for harmony and unity, specifically reflecting the requirements and goals of diligence and thrift.

Must Greatly Save Grain and Cotton Cloth

Advocate: Eat enough, eat well, eat economically; advocate: warm, neat, economical; oppose the wasteful phenomena of comparing eating, comparing dressing, and comparing extravagance.

At present, we must pay special attention to advocating savings in grain and cotton cloth. In terms of grain saving, we advocate "eat enough, eat well, eat economically"; in terms of cotton cloth saving, we advocate wearing "warm, neat, and economical" clothes. We must carry forward the existing saving experience of our people and encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for saving and storing. At the same time, we must oppose extravagance and waste, the bad habits of comparing eating, comparing dressing, and comparing extravagance. Weddings and funerals and human relations should be simple and economical, and laziness and gambling should be opposed. We must use money where it is most needed, and money that can be used or not used should not be used, and long-term plans should be made. Not only people with old people above them and young people below them should make long-term plans and strive to have savings, but even people who are not married will also have to start a family in the future, so they also need to strive to have savings. Some people think that advocating frugal housekeeping means "everyone levels their lives" and "living within their means, using as much as they have," which is also a misunderstanding. Women are not only an important force on the production front, but also the main force in household labor, so women have a particularly important responsibility for frugal housekeeping. But this is by no means just a matter for women. If family members cannot work together and discuss matters, the family's diligent and frugal plan cannot be well implemented. Only when the whole family, men and women, young and old, have a unified understanding, unity and harmony, and act in unison, can we truly implement diligent and frugal housekeeping. We believe that when the broad masses deeply understand the relationship between frugal housekeeping and frugal national construction, they will more actively and conscientiously implement frugal housekeeping and actively support socialist construction from the family. We firmly believe that women in all walks of life across the country, as well as housewives, will, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, exert their energy, overcome difficulties, give play to their wisdom, and improve their skills, and strive for the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production in 1958 with practical actions of diligence and frugality.

    加速社会主义建设　进一步改善人民生活
    让我国一亿个家庭都做到克勤克俭
    杨之华代表的发言
    广大妇女鼓足革命干劲  积极参加增产节约运动
    我完全拥护大会的各项报告。
    在中国共产党中央提出的在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，同时在农业上也要相应地使我国成为世界上单位面积高产量的国家的伟大号召鼓舞下，广大妇女经过认真的学习辩论，提高了觉悟，扩大了眼界，看到了社会主义光辉灿烂的远景，明确了奋斗的目标。她们怀着空前高涨的劳动热情，鼓足革命干劲，从四面八方投入了社会主义事业大跃进的巨流。广大女职工积极地参加了增产节约运动和社会主义竞赛，比先进，学先进，赶先进，热火朝天地展开车间与车间，小组与小组的竞赛，千方百计地找窍门，挖潜力，争取超额完成一九五八年的任务。广大农村妇女为着实现农业生产大跃进，积极参加冬季生产，投入了翻天复地、轰轰烈烈的兴修水利、积肥、除四害和冬季田间管理，植树造林运动。根据十三个省、市，四十八个县的材料，妇女参加冬季生产的劳力出勤都在百分之八十到九十，有的农业社妇女劳力百分之百地投入了运动。她们决心大，办法多，出勤率高，男女分工合作得好，干得十分出色。她们说：“天不怕，地不怕，坚决完成水利化”，“出门背粪筐，捡的满荡荡，要是没有粪，草末也要捡一筐”。甘肃武山县水土保持工作中百分之八十的活由妇女担任，男女分工也很合理。她们说：“男子镢头女子铣，青壮年陡岩边，妇女老幼缓坡担，挖坑背土男子干，植树浇水女为先”。
    对勤俭持家有了正确认识
    大河有水小河流，国有社有家才有，能促进生产，节约开支，提高觉悟。
    广大妇女经过社会主义大辩论，互相启发教育，也进一步认识了勤俭持家的意义，对爱国、爱社、爱家三者的关系也有了较正确的认识，她们说：“大河有水小河流，国有、社有、家才有。”“增产节约爱国家，勤俭持家人人夸。”“丰收莫忘歉收苦，饱时莫忘饿时难。”各地在社会主义教育运动的基础上，在群众中贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家方针后，明显地看到有三大好处：一是促进了生产的发展，增加了社员的收入；二是树立了节约风气，积累了资金，部分农户开始有计划地安排家庭开支，节约粮食、棉布等；三是提高了社员觉悟，增强了爱国观念。例如江西省九江县，广大妇女出勤率普遍增加，她们积极参加了农副业生产，共增养猪一千九百八十头，开展副业门路三百四十三种，增加收入十一万六千零六十八元。在节约方面，据三个乡不完全统计，社员仅仅由于减少熬糖做酒一项就节约粮食七万八千一百三十一斤。有的社，还在计划用粮的基础上，建立了粮食储备制度。另据八个乡的统计，通过计划开支，共争取多储蓄十一万四千一百元，向社多投资十三万七千二百七十元。超支户已大大减少。社员爱国爱社的思想也有提高，如胜利社原欠国家贷款一万五千元，只计划还一半，经过安排生活后，贷款已全部还清。新塘区原已认购公债一万零五百四十元，开始勤俭持家运动后，又增购了五千一百四十元。
    各地经过辩论，对于农民中存在的“千家万户合一家，没吃少穿找国家”单纯依赖国家的错误思想，有了很大的克服；一些不作长期打算，不注意节约的现象，有了显著的改变，群众中已涌现出大批勤俭持家的积极分子。据河南省鲁山县一九五七年十一月份统计，全县共涌现出勤俭持家模范一千五百四十九人，饲养家畜家禽模范二千三百零二户，节约粮食模范四千七百一十二人，“五好”积极分子三千七百一十七人。在先进人物的带头下，全县大部分的农户已经制定了勤俭持家计划。
    勤俭道理还须深入宣传
    只有千家万户树立了勤俭风气，才能进一步加速社会主义建设。
    但是，现在各地宣传推行勤俭建国、勤俭持家的工作还不够普遍深入，在宣传中也遇到了各种不同的认识和理解，因此，我们还要进一步地宣传勤俭建国、勤俭持家的道理。
    勤俭建国，正如大家所知道的，是建设社会主义的根本方针。必须把勤俭的精神贯彻到生产、工作、办一切事业和家庭生活中去。勤俭持家是为了勤俭建国，为了建设社会主义，为了进一步发展生产和改善人民生活。我们既要执行勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针，积极参加生产和各种建设事业，发展工农业生产，增加人民收入，又要勤俭持家。因为家庭不但是社会的一个消费单位，而且目前农村的家庭，在一定程度上还对合作社的生产起着一定的辅助作用。只有千家万户克勤克俭，才能够在社会上树立和巩固勤俭的风气。家庭若能勤俭，对个人，对家庭，对国家和子孙后代都有好处。我国有一亿多个家庭，每户家庭的点滴增产与节约，就能为国家增加巨大的财富；同样，一亿多个家庭如果稍加浪费，就会造成国家巨大的损失。而国家的增收与减收，归根到底，又都对每个家庭收入的增加或减少起着决定的作用。因此，勤俭持家，是关系着正确处理人民群众个人和国家、当前利益和长远利益的大问题，不是无足轻重的单纯家务琐事。有人认为提倡勤俭持家是让群众“过苦日子”，这是一种不正确的认识。我们现在提倡勤俭持家，是在工农业生产有了发展，全国人民生活有了改善的基础上提出的。其目的既不是仅仅为了解决暂时的某些困难，更不是降低现在的生活水平，限制人民改善生活，而是为了在继续发展生产的基础上，继续逐步的提高我们的生活水平。提倡勤俭持家是积极地为了加速社会主义建设，为了进一步改善全国人民生活奠定更坚实的基础。
    我们现在提倡勤俭持家和旧社会劳动人民勤俭持家所处的社会环境，有着本质的不同。在剥削阶级统治的社会里，劳动人民虽然勤劳节俭一生，仍旧摆脱不了贫困的处境。在社会主义社会里，我们提倡勤俭持家，则一定可以在共同劳动的基础上，达到共同富裕的目的。我们要继承和发扬我国劳动人民勤劳节俭的优良传统，坚决走社会主义共同富裕的道路，绝不走损人利己，个人发家致富的资本主义的道路。
    各业妇女的勤俭目标
    农村妇女：积极参加农副业和家务劳动，对三者进行合理安排。
    城市家庭妇女：勤于家务劳动，有领导地开展服务性互助劳动，适当进行副业劳动。
    女职工：既搞好本岗位工作，又积极地参加家务劳动。
    我们提倡辛勤劳动和厉行节约。希望农村妇女在勤的方面作到根据合作社的需要，积极参加农业劳动、副业劳动和家务劳动，并且对三者进行合理安排。我们提倡城市家庭妇女要安排好家庭生活，勤于家务劳动；有领导地开展服务性的劳动互助；并在服从城市生产计划需要下，适当地搞一些家庭副业。在女职工中，是提倡既要搞好生产和工作，又要做到勤俭持家。料理家务和参加社会劳动同样是光荣的劳动。操持家务，管理家庭，是具有重大的社会意义的。在历史上家务劳动对于社会生产的维持和发展和民族的生存和繁荣，从来就是不可缺少的。在社会主义社会里，家务劳动就更具有社会意义，是社会主义建设中不可缺少的部分。但是，我们提倡尊重家务劳动，并不意味着要在职在业的妇女都回到家庭去，而是要求她们既要搞好本岗位的工作，同时要积极地参加家务劳动。有些人以为提倡勤俭持家就是要妇女回到家庭去，实际上这是一种误解或是歪曲。
    由于每个家庭情况的不同和需要不同，勤劳和节俭的具体要求和办法就要因时、因地、因人制宜。河南省鲁山县马楼乡丰丽社贯彻勤俭持家的口号是四比四赛：比劳动、赛合理分工；比节约用粮、用布，赛过好日子；比养猪积肥，赛采集代食品；比尊婆爱媳，赛和睦团结，具体地体现了勤俭的要求和目的。
    必须大大节约粮食棉布
    提倡：吃得饱，吃得好，吃得省；提倡：暖和、整洁、节省；反对比吃，比穿，比排场的浪费现象。
    当前我们要特别注意提倡在粮食和棉布方面的节约。在粮食节约方面，我们提倡“吃得饱，吃得好，吃得省”；在棉布节约方面，提倡穿得“暖和，整洁，节省”。要发扬我国人民已有的节约经验，鼓励群众节约储备的积极性。同时我们要反对铺张浪费，比吃、比穿、比排场的坏风气。红白喜事，人情应酬方面应该力求俭朴，反对游手好闲，以及赌博等恶习。我们要把钱用到最需要的地方，可用可不用的钱就不用，并应作长期打算。不仅上有老，下有小的人要长期打算，争取有储蓄；就是没有结婚的人将来也要成家立业，因此，也需要争取有储蓄。有些人以为提倡勤俭持家，是“大家拉平生活”，“量入为出，有多少用多少”，这也是一种误解。妇女不仅是生产战线上的一支重要力量，而且是家务劳动方面的主力，因此，要作到勤俭持家，妇女的责任特别重大。但这绝不仅仅是妇女的事，如果家庭成员不能通力合作商量办事，家庭勤劳节俭的计划就不能很好的实现。只有全家男女老少，统一认识，团结和睦，一致行动，才能真正贯彻执行勤俭持家。我们相信，当广大群众深刻地理解了勤俭持家与勤俭建国的关系以后，一定会更加积极认真的贯彻执行勤俭持家，从家庭方面积极支援社会主义建设。我们坚信，全国各行各业妇女以及家庭妇女，一定会和全国人民一道，在中国共产党的领导下，鼓足干劲，克服困难，发挥智慧提高技术，以勤劳节俭的实际行动，为一九五八年全国工农业生产大跃进而奋斗。
