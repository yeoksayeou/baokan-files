Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 16th: Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution issued an order on the evening of the 16th for the arrest and detention of rebels Sjafruddin, Harahap, Sumitro, Syafei, Salempatte, and Usman in all parts of the country. This is because they were engaged in activities in Central Sumatra aimed at overthrowing the legitimate central government by violence and establishing a so-called "revolutionary government," assuming the positions of "Prime Minister" and "Ministers," etc.

The Army Chief of Staff instructed all state organs in the order that anyone who arrested any of these people should submit a report within twenty-four hours.

At the same time, the Indonesian Army Chief of Staff also issued a circular warning people not to participate in the activities of the traitorous group in Central Sumatra, which established the so-called "revolutionary government" on the 15th, and those who violate this will be severely punished according to law.

Nasution also sent telegrams to Warouw, the military attaché at the Indonesian Embassy in China, Rahad, the Chief of Staff of the former 7th Military District Commander Sumual, and Lin Tang, a local "leader" in Makassar, ordering them to indicate within three days whether they accepted the "Ministerial" positions offered by the Central Sumatra rebel group or continued to be loyal to the central government in Jakarta.

According to reports, the Central Sumatra rebel group established a "revolutionary government" on the 15th, headed by Sjafruddin, who had recently left his position as President of the Bank of Indonesia without authorization to go to Central Sumatra and was subsequently dismissed, as "Prime Minister" and "Minister of Finance." Simbolon, the former commander of the First Military District who had previously launched a failed coup in North Sumatra, was appointed "Minister of Foreign Affairs," and Djambek, the former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army who had fled due to involvement in a corruption case, was appointed "Minister of the Interior." Prior to this, these two, along with Hussein and Lubis, had already been ordered to be wanted by Army Chief of Staff Nasution for engaging in treasonous activities.

Sjafruddin announced that the "government's" task was to overthrow the current central government and abolish the Sukarno Plan. He said that if former Vice President Hatta and former Defense Minister, the Sultan of Yogyakarta, were willing, the "government" would be led by them, or they would form a new "government." He said that in the areas controlled by the rebel group, the "safety" of foreign enterprises would be guaranteed. According to a United Press International report from Washington, Sjafruddin was "well-regarded by certain officials in Washington," and he had visited Washington when he was in charge of the Bank of Indonesia.

According to the "Indonesian Torch" newspaper's report from Padang on the 15th, the Central Sumatra rebel group had already dispatched agents abroad on the evening of the 15th, attempting to obtain foreign recognition and support through traitorous activities. This group conducted negotiations with three major foreign oil companies and reached a decision that if they seized power, they would grant the oil exploration rights of the Sungai Gerong oil production center near Pekanbaru, the oil production center of Central Sumatra, as well as the exploration rights of two million hectares of oil fields bordering West Sumatra and Jambi to Mobil Oil and Texaco. They also promised to "return" the oil fields in North Sumatra to the Dutch Batavia Petroleum Company.

According to this newspaper, Sumitro, a member of the Indonesian Socialist Party who was sent to Western Europe on Hussein's orders, also had the task of begging for foreign support by handing over the mining rights to Western countries, including agreeing to West Germany's mining of iron ore in Lampung and West Sumatra. In addition, Sumual had gone to Japan to propose the sale of mining rights.

    纳苏蒂安下令逮捕首要叛乱分子
    沙弗鲁丁等粉墨登台妄想颠覆中央政府
    勾搭美荷等国出卖开采油田矿山的主权
    新华社雅加达16日电　印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安16日晚上下令全国各地逮捕和拘禁叛乱分子沙弗鲁丁、哈拉哈普、苏米特罗、夏费、萨伦帕特和乌斯曼等六人，因为他们在中苏门答腊从事目的在于使用暴力推翻合法的中央政府的活动，建立一个所谓“革命政府”，分任“总理”和“部长”等职务。
    陆军参谋长在命令中指示所有国家机关，凡是逮捕了这些人中的任何一个，都应该在二十四小时内提出报告。
    同时，印度尼西亚陆军参谋长还发出通告，警告人们不要参加中苏门答腊卖国集团15日建立的所谓“革命政府”的活动，违者将依法严办。
    纳苏蒂安还打电报给印度尼西亚驻中国大使馆武官瓦罗以及前第七军区司令苏穆阿尔的参谋长拉哈德和望加锡的地方“领袖”林汤，限令他们在三天之内表明他们是接受中苏门答腊叛乱集团所给予的“部长”职务，还是继续效忠雅加达中央政府。
    据报道，中苏门答腊叛乱集团在15日成立了“革命政府”，由最近擅自离开印度尼西亚银行总裁职务到中苏门答腊去而被撤职的沙弗鲁丁任“总理”兼“财政部长”。曾经在北苏门答腊发动政变失败的前第一军区司令西姆波朗任“外交部长”，因同贪污案有牵连而逃跑的前陆军副参谋长贾姆贝克任“内政部长”。在这以前，这两个人和侯赛尼、卢比斯已经因为进行叛逆活动被陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安下令通缉。
    沙弗鲁丁宣布，“政府”的任务是要推翻目前的中央政府，取消苏加诺方案。他说，如果前副总统哈达和前国防部长日惹苏丹愿意的话，“政府”将由他们领导，或者由他们成立新“政府”。他说，在叛乱集团控制的地区，外国企业的“安全”将获得保证。据合众社华盛顿消息，沙弗鲁丁“很受华盛顿某些官员的赏识”，他在负责印度尼西亚银行的工作的时候曾经访问过华盛顿。
    据“印度尼西亚火炬报”15日巴东消息，中苏门答腊叛乱集团已经在15日晚上派遣代理人前往国外，企图以卖国活动取得外国的承认和支持。这个集团同外国的三家大石油公司进行了谈判，并且已经达成了这样的决定：如果他们夺得了政权，他们将把中苏门答腊石油开采中心北干巴鲁附近的松加甘巴石油开采权以及同西苏门答腊和占碑交界的二百万公顷油田的开采权让给美孚油公司和德士古石油公司。他们还答应把北苏门答腊的油田“交还”荷兰的巴达维亚石油公司。
    据这家报纸说，奉侯赛尼命令到西欧的印度尼西亚社会党人苏米特罗也有乞求外国支持的任务，办法是把矿藏的开采权交给西方国家，其中包括同意西德在楠榜和西苏门答腊开采铁矿。此外，苏穆阿尔曾经到日本去提出出卖某些矿藏的开采权的建议。
