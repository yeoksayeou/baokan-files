Lowest Cost, Best Quality
Beijing's Local Industry Catches Up with the Advanced

(Reported by our newspaper) The factories of Beijing's local industrial system have launched a surge of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced," determined to catch up with the national advanced level in terms of product quality, cost, and technical and economic indicators in a short period of time.

Nearly 400 cadres, technicians, and workers have recently been sent by various factories to Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Jinzhou, and other places to collect advanced indicators and learn advanced technologies. The Beijing Oxygen Plant, the Dahua Ceramics Factory, and others have sent their factory directors to lead relevant personnel to study at fraternal factories in other places. After the "returned students" from many factories came back, they immediately focused on key issues such as improving quality and reducing costs, and studied measures to catch up with the advanced. The working group of the Beijing No. 1 Dyeing and Weaving Factory, led by the factory director, found after comparing with nine advanced factories in Tianjin that the quality and variety of products of their factory were not as good as those of the Tianjin factories. The day they returned, it was Sunday. Everyone did not rest. In the morning, they studied and developed a plan to trial-produce new products, and that night they carried out the weaving of new products, and the next day they weaved samples with excellent patterns and quality. The factories under the Second Bureau of Local Industry, after preliminary comparison and research, proposed that 106 varieties should catch up with or exceed the advanced levels at home and abroad within the next two years. The Beijing Enamel Factory plans to have the enamel washbasins reach the level of Shanghai Huafeng Enamel Factory in terms of gloss, color, heat resistance, and alkali resistance in the second quarter of this year, and the cost should be reduced to the same level as that of the Yifeng Enamel Factory. The quality of the yellow cattle sole leather produced by the Beijing Leather Factory has reached the first-class level in China. They also requested to continue to improve and respond to the initiative of the Shanghai Yimin Leather Factory to catch up with the international level within five years; the quality of cattle leather should also catch up with the Shanghai Yimin Leather Factory before July this year.

Some factories, in view of the fact that when their products catch up, similar products in fraternal cities will continue to leap forward, therefore propose to run at double speed in order to catch up.

    成本要最低　质量要最好
    北京地方工业迎头赶先进
    本报讯　北京市地方工业系统各工厂掀起“比先进、学先进、赶先进”的热潮，决心在短时期内从产品质量、成本和技术经济指标等方面赶上全国先进水平。
    各厂最近派往上海、天津、南京、广州、锦州等地搜集先进指标、学习先进技术的干部、技术人员和工人将近四百人。北京氧气厂、大华陶瓷厂等，都是由厂长自己带领有关人员到外地兄弟厂学习。许多工厂在“留学”人员回来以后，马上就围绕着提高质量和降低成本等关键问题，研究赶上先进的措施。北京市染织一厂以厂长为首的工作组，经过同天津九个先进厂对比，发现本厂产品的质量和品种都不如天津的工厂。他们回来的第二天，正是星期天。大家没有休息，上午就研究出试制新产品的计划，当晚进行新产品织造，第二天就织出了样品，花色、质量都很好。第二地方工业局所属各厂，经过初步对比研究，提出有一百零六个品种要在今明两年内赶上或超过国内外先进水平。北京市搪瓷厂计划今年第二季度就使搪瓷面盆在光泽、花色、耐热、耐碱等方面达到上海华丰搪瓷厂的水平，成本也要降低到同艺丰搪瓷厂一样。北京市制革厂的黄牛底革，质量已经达到国内第一流水平了，他们还要求继续提高，并且要响应上海益民制革厂的倡议，在五年内赶上国际水平；牛皮面革的质量也要在今年7月份以前赶上上海益民制革厂。
    有些工厂鉴于本厂产品赶上前去的时候，兄弟城市的同类产品又会继续向前跃进，因此提出要开足双倍马力，以便迎头赶上。
