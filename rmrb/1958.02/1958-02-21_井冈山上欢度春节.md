Other squadrons also congratulated the local masses on the Spring Festival. Afterwards, the masses in each village beat gongs and drums and set off firecrackers to pay respects to the cadres of the reclamation farm.

	Many dispatched cadres said that this was the first time in their lives that they had spent such a warm and educational festival among the working masses. The local masses said that with so many good cadres coming up the mountain, this year was the most lively Spring Festival they had had in thirty years.

    井冈山上欢度春节
    据新华社井冈山19日电　江西省下放到革命摇篮井冈山的干部，同当地人民一起欢度春节。
    除夕，井冈山上各村灯火通明，锣鼓喧天。在毛主席居住过的大井村，下放干部和群众在茶话会上一起谈家常。当年的乡苏维埃主席柳青介绍了毛主席、朱德副主席在井冈山时的艰苦战斗生活。五十多岁的红军女战士赖发秀热情地在会上唱了好几支红军时代的山歌。
    初一清晨，垦殖场场长、长征战士马廷士同省委慰问团一起向乡人民委员会和当地烈属、军属祝贺春节。其他各中队也分别向当地群众祝贺春节。接着，各村群众又敲锣打鼓大放爆竹，向垦殖场的干部回拜。
    许多下放干部说，这是生平第一次在劳动群众中过这么热情而有教育意义的节日。当地群众说，有这么多这么好的干部上山来，今年过了个三十年来未有过的热闹春节。
