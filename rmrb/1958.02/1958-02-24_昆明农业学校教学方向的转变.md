    The Transformation of the Teaching Direction of Kunming Agricultural School
    By Our Reporter Qin Junguang
    After rectification, Kunming Agricultural School is showing a thriving new look. The teaching work, which used to take the so-called "national level" as the standard, is now proceeding from the actual situation in Yunnan in every aspect; the teachers and students, who never wanted to deal with agricultural cooperatives, have now established deep friendships with many agricultural cooperatives. Originally, more than 90% of the students never thought of becoming manual laborers, but now they are not only accustomed to manual labor, but also determined to become new farmers with culture and technology for the rest of their lives.
    Kunming Agricultural School is a school that aims to train intermediate agricultural technical cadres. From 1950 to the present, it has provided 746 technical cadres for state-owned farms and technical extension stations, basically meeting the needs. In the future, state-owned farms and technical extension stations will not only not need to add intermediate technical cadres, but also need to export them. So, where will the graduates of Kunming Agricultural School be placed? Some people say that the more than 10,000 agricultural cooperatives in the province are in great need of technical cadres, but they do not need this kind of full-time technical cadres who "specialize" in only a little agricultural knowledge in the next five to seven years. What to do? Should Kunming Agricultural School continue to operate as it is, or should it not be operated, or should it change its direction and then operate it?
    In February of last year, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government convened a national conference of principals of agricultural technical schools in Nanjing. The meeting determined that technical schools should continue to be run, and should be run even better. It also decided to "face the region, face production, face agricultural cooperatives, and cultivate new farmers with socialist consciousness, culture, technology, and good health for agricultural cooperatives."
    The policy was there, but no one knew how to do it specifically. It was not until this rectification, after the great airing of views, great contending, and great debates, that a path was found.
    In August of last year, teachers and staff of the school posted more than 300 big-character posters, putting forward more than 500 opinions. Among these opinions, they sharply criticized the dogmatism in teaching work and the separation of teaching from reality.
    The main manifestation of the separation of teaching work from reality is that it does not proceed from the characteristics of the Yunnan region, but mechanically transports Soviet teaching experience and the so-called "national unified standards". Some teachers said that what Yunnan needs is exactly what is not in the teaching syllabus, and what Yunnan does not need is often the focus of the teaching syllabus. For example, broad beans are the most important spring crop in Yunnan, but they are not in the crop cultivation course. Yunnan grows winter wheat, but the course talks about spring wheat. The crop cultivation course also includes the improvement technology of saline-alkali soil and black calcium soil, but Yunnan does not have this kind of soil at all. Yunnan urgently needs to prevent rice borers and rice blast, but they do not account for a large proportion of the plant protection course. Yunnan does not have locusts at all. In order to meet the "national unified standards", the prevention and control of locusts is the focus of teaching. Also, electrified and mechanized farming methods and specialized courses such as fish farming and bee keeping are useless for a considerable period of time.
    Even so, some teachers believe that the key problem of Kunming Agricultural School is not that teaching is divorced from reality, but that the teaching quality is not high. They proposed to increase teaching equipment, establish a veterinary hospital, and purchase tractors... They said that agricultural cooperatives are "too backward", and that the lack of tractors and electrified equipment cannot meet the requirements of teaching practice. They advocated that they should continue to practice in state-owned farms.
    The school's Party general branch and school administration summarized these opinions, and in order to better implement the policy of "facing the region, facing production, facing agricultural cooperatives," they proposed what kind of people the school should cultivate in the future, and whether the countryside has a future. They organized everyone to conduct special debates. In the debate, the vast majority of teachers expressed their support for facing the region and facing production. However, some people still could not figure it out ideologically. Some teachers believed: "It is completely correct for teaching work to face reality, but it is a pity to assign graduates to agricultural cooperatives as members." Some said: "The state spends so much money to train them, and the result is still a farmer. I don't think this deal is worth it." Among the students, the ideological shock was even greater. Some said: "I feel sore and weak in my legs and feet even after participating in one or two voluntary labor sessions. The countryside does not need educated people at all. As long as you can lift a five-jin heavy hoe, you are a good member." A student named Ming Pingbo said: "The countryside needs people who can record scores and keep accounts. It is a pity to put people like us in agricultural cooperatives as farmers."
    The people trained by the agricultural school despise the countryside and manual labor so much. This is the consequence of the serious separation of teaching work from reality. The school leaders seriously studied this issue and believed that this was a key issue that must be resolved in this rectification. To solve this problem, teachers and students must be educated in labor, and they must be put into labor in batches in a planned way to exercise and transform themselves, so as to lay a good foundation for future agricultural labor. Then, the school clearly stipulated that each class should have 70 days of teaching and production practice in agricultural cooperatives every year, 8 hours of labor in the school's farm every week, and 4 to 5 hours of manual labor in nearby agricultural cooperatives every Saturday afternoon.
    Then, the school established contact with more than a dozen nearby agricultural cooperatives. It also jointly formed a practice guidance committee with the agricultural cooperatives to uniformly determine the practice schedule.
    Going to agricultural cooperatives for practice was not pleasant for everyone. When the animal husbandry specialty class heard that they were going to Jin Guang Agricultural Cooperative for practice, most of them expressed disappointment, saying: "What's so good about practicing there? It's just a few old cows and old horses. It's not as exciting as Songming Animal Husbandry Farm." Under the leadership of teachers and Party and Youth League activists, they finally went. When they arrived at Jin Guang Agricultural Cooperative, many students' views changed. This cooperative had more than 2,000 head of various livestock. Some students deeply felt that their technical knowledge was too little in front of these many livestock. The students of crop cultivation and plant protection and other specialty classes who went to Xianfeng, Qianjin and other agricultural cooperatives for practice also felt that they gained much more than practicing in farms. Some even said: "It's not that agricultural cooperatives are backward, but that our thinking is backward." The teachers also deeply felt that their knowledge was not enough to fully answer the various questions raised by the students, and they needed to study hard in the agricultural cooperatives.
    During the days when the interns got along with the members of the cooperatives, they deeply felt that the countryside was in urgent need of them. Students majoring in animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and plant protection treated livestock for the agricultural cooperatives, helped the agricultural cooperatives build cowsheds, pigsties, and sheepfolds, built toilets, and patiently taught many agricultural technologies. The agricultural cooperatives were very grateful. The head of Paoma Mountain Agricultural Cooperative repeatedly expressed his gratitude to the principal of the school and requested that the school must assign several graduates to them.
    After this period of practice, the students have also undergone great changes in their thinking. Yan Zijian, a student of the veterinary class, said: "I was very afraid of manual labor at first. I thought that people like me would not be able to bear labor. But now, I am used to it. Manual labor is really hard at first and sweet later." Female student Zhao Huikun used to say: "I can't figure it out if I want to be a farmer," but now she expresses confidence in working in the countryside for the rest of her life.
    Through several months of labor training, the teachers of Kunming Agricultural School have also greatly improved their thinking. On this basis, they revised the teaching syllabus and teaching content, deleted some courses that were not suitable for the situation in Yunnan and some that were not yet needed, and added animal husbandry, livestock farm implements, broad bean science, and paddy field farming methods and other courses that Yunnan urgently needed. In teaching, special attention was also paid to the close combination of professional courses and comprehensive courses, so that students not only understand professional knowledge, but also understand general agricultural knowledge, so as to meet the needs of agricultural cooperatives.

    昆明农业学校教学方向的转变
    本报记者　秦军光
    昆明农业学校，经过整改以后，全校出现欣欣向荣的新气象，一向以所谓“全国水平”为准则的教学工作，现在已是处处从云南的实际出发了；从来不愿同农业社打交道的师生，现在已和很多的农业社建立了深厚的友谊。原来90％以上的学生根本没想过要去作一个体力劳动者，现在不仅习惯了体力劳动，还决心要去做一辈子有文化有技术的新农民。
    昆明农业学校是一个以培养中等农业技术干部为方针的学校，从1950年到现在，共为各国营农场和技术推广站输送了七百四十六名技术干部，基本上满足了需要。今后，各国营农场和技术推广站，不仅不需要增添中等的技术干部，而且还要向外输送。那末，昆明农业学校的毕业生往那里放呢？有人说，全省一万多个农业社很需要技术干部，可是在五、七年内又不需要这种脱产和“专”得只懂得一点农业常识的技术干部。怎办呢？昆明农业学校是照原样办下去呢？还是不办或改变方向再办呢？
    去年2月间，中央农业部在南京召开了全国农业技术学校校长会议。会议确定技术学校还是要继续办下去，而且要办得更好。还决定要“面向地区、面向生产、面向农业社，为农业社培养具有社会主义觉悟的具有文化、技术、身体健康的新农民”。
    方针是有了，如何具体地去做，谁也不清楚。一直到这次整风，经过了大鸣大放大辩论，才算找着了途径。
    去年8月间，全校教职员工共贴出了大字报三百多张，提出意见五百多条。在这些意见中，尖锐的批评了教学工作中的教条主义、教学脱离实际。
    教学工作脱离实际，主要的表现是不从云南地区特点出发，生硬的搬运苏联教学经验和所谓“全国统一标准”。有的教员说，云南需要的正是教学大纲上没有的，云南不需要的却常是教学大纲中的重点。例如：蚕豆是云南最主要的小春作物，但植物栽培课程中没有。云南种的是冬小麦，课程中讲的都是春小麦。植物栽培课程里还有盐碱土、黑钙土的改良技术，可是云南根本就没有这种土壤。云南很需要防止螟虫、稻热病，可是植物保护的课程中占的份量不多。云南根本就没有飞蝗，为了“全国统一标准”，防治飞蝗却是讲授的重点。还有电气化、机械化的耕作方法和养鱼、养蜂等专业课程，在相当长的时间内都是用不着的。
    虽然如此，可是有些教员却认为昆明农校关键问题不是教学脱离实际，而是教学质量不高。他们提议要增设教学设备、建立兽医院，构置拖拉机……。说农业社“太落后”，没有拖拉机，没有电气化设备就不能满足教学实习的要求。他们主张，应该继续到国营农场实习。
    学校党总支和学校行政综合了这些意见，为了更好的贯彻“面向地区、面向生产、面向农业社”的方针，提出学校今后究竟应当培养什么样的人，农村到底有前途没有？组织大家进行专题辩论。在辩论中，对于面向地区、面向生产，绝大多数教师都表示拥护。但是也有一些人思想搞不通。有的教员认为：“教学工作面向实际是完全正确的，但是把毕业生分配到农业社里当社员，未免太可惜了。”有的说：“国家花这样多钱来培养他们，结果还是个农民，这笔账我看划不来。”在学生中，思想震动也更大，有的说：“偶而参加一两次义务劳动还腰酸腿痛的，农村根本用不着有文化的人，只要能举得起五斤重的大镢头，就是好社员。”一个叫鸣平波的同学说：“农村需要的是能记个分挂个账的人，像我们这样的人放到农业社当农民太可惜了。”
    农业学校培养出来的人，却这样轻视农村，轻视体力劳动，这就是教学工作严重脱离实际所造成的后果。学校领导认真的研究了这一问题，认为这是此次整改中必须解决的一个关键问题。解决这个问题，必须对师生进行劳动教育，有计划地分批把他们放到劳动中去锻炼改造，为将来从事农业劳动打好基础。接着学校就明确规定了每班每年有七十天在农业社进行教学生产实习，每周要有八个小时在本校农场劳动，此外，每一个星期六下午还要有四至五个小时到附近农业社参加体力劳动。
    接着，学校同附近十多个农业社建立了联系。并和农业社共同组成了实习指导委员会，统一定出实习的日程。
    要去农业社进行实习，并不是每个人都是愉快的。动物饲养专业班听说要他们去金光农业社实习，多数表示失望似的说：“这有什么好实习的，还不是几条老牛老马，那里比得上嵩明畜牧农场来劲。”这个班在老师和党团员积极分子的带动下，终于还是去了，到了金光农业社，许多同学的看法就变了。这个社有各种牲口二千多头。有些同学在这许多牲畜前面，深深感到自己的技术懂得太少了。去先锋、前进等农业社实习植物栽培和植物保护等专业班的同学，也都觉得比在农场实习收获大得多。有的还说：“并不是农业社落后，而是我们的思想落后了。”老师们也深深感到知识不够，不能圆满的解答学生们提出的各种疑问，须要踏踏实实地在农业社钻一钻。
    实习同学在同社员们相处的日子里，深深的感觉到农村是迫切的需要他们。动物饲养、兽医，植物保护等专业的同学，为农业社的牲畜医病、帮助农业社修建牛厩、猪厩、羊厩、盖厕所、并耐心的传授了许多农业技术，农业社非常感激。跑马山农业社社长再三向该校校长表示感谢，并要求学校一定要分配几个毕业生给他们。
    经过这一段实习，学生们在思想方面也起了很大的变化。兽医班学生严子健说：“我起初是很怕体力劳动的。我想，像我这样的人劳动一定是吃不消的。可是现在，我已是习惯了。体力劳动真是先苦后甜”。女同学赵慧坤过去曾说：“要我当农民，一百个想不通”，现在表示有信心在农村干一辈子。
    昆明农业学校通过几个月的劳动锻炼，教师们的思想也有了很大提高。在这个基础上，他们修改了教学大纲和教学内容，把那些不适合云南地区情况和目前还用不到的一些课程作了删减，增设了云南迫切需要的动物饲养、牲畜农具、蚕豆学及水田耕作法等课程。在教学中，还特别注意了专业课程同综合课程密切相结合，不仅使学生懂得专业知识，还要懂得一般的农业知识，以适应农业社的需要。
