The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Artists Association, and the Beijing People's Fine Arts Publishing House recently jointly held two symposiums to focus on discussing how to promote the creation of New Year pictures. The symposiums were chaired by Zhou Weizhi, Director of the Art Bureau, and Cai Ruohong, Vice Chairman of the Artists Association, respectively. The participating artists included Ye Qianyu, Jiang Zhaohe, Shao Yu, Zhou Lingjian, Huang Jun, Li Hu, Xiao Shufang, Huang Yongyu, Zong Qixiang, Lu Hongnian, Wu Jingbo, Jiang Yan, Sheng Bijun and more than forty others. Working comrades from the Ministry of Culture's Publishing Bureau, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, and Xinhua Bookstore also participated.

Everyone believed that New Year pictures have greatly developed in recent years. In 1957, 90 million copies were published, selling well throughout the country and were deeply welcomed by the masses. However, there are still many urgent problems to be solved in the creation, publication, and distribution of New Year pictures. In terms of creation, the content and form of some New Year pictures deviate from the characteristics of New Year pictures, and are not loved by the masses, and some are simply incomprehensible. Some New Year pictures are able to reach the masses, but lack socialist ideological content, and some individual publishers even require artists to create superstitious and backward New Year pictures. In terms of publication and distribution, publishing houses do not pay enough attention to works that reflect the new atmosphere of socialist construction; the selection of ancient costume New Year pictures is also repetitive, with large print runs, and there are also problems with manuscript fees. When sales units order New Year pictures, they often cannot truly understand the needs and preferences of the masses, and the adoption of cooperative sales methods, etc., are all worth studying. At present, all socialist construction undertakings across the country are advancing by leaps and bounds, and New Year pictures, which can best penetrate the farmers, should also serve the great leap forward in agriculture. Many artists believe that this year they should draw a set of works related to the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Development Program. Jiang Zhaohe said that he had not paid enough attention to New Year pictures in the past, and he must do a good job of painting this year; Li Hu had never painted New Year pictures, and he will strive to paint one this year. Many artists not only expressed that they want to paint New Year pictures, but also expressed that they want to learn from traditional folk New Year pictures, and hope that the Artists Association can organize an exhibition of folk New Year pictures for art workers to observe.

In addition, the Ministry of Culture, the Artists Association, and the People's Fine Arts Publishing House also organized New Year picture exhibitions around the Spring Festival, and toured old liberated areas such as Wanxian and Tangxian in Hebei Province to widely listen to the opinions of the masses for artists to refer to when improving the creation of New Year pictures.

    首都美术家为五亿农民创作新年画
    中华人民共和国文化部、中国美术家协会和北京人民美术出版社，最近联合召开了二次座谈会，集中讨论了如何促进年画创作的问题。座谈会由艺术局局长周巍峙和美协副主席蔡若虹分别主持，出席的画家有叶浅予、蒋兆和、邵宇、周令剑、黄均、李斛、萧淑芳、黄永玉、宗其香、陆鸿年、吴静波、姜燕、盛比君等四十余人。文化部出版局、人民美术出版社和新华书店也有工作同志参加。
    大家认为：近年来年画有很大发展，1957年就出版了九千万份，畅销全国各地，深受群众欢迎。但是在年画的创作、出版和发行方面，也还有许多急待解决的问题。在创作上，有些年画的内容和形式脱离了年画的特点，不为群众所喜爱，有的根本看不懂。也有些年画虽能深入群众，但又缺少社会主义的思想内容，甚至个别出版社还要求画家创作迷信落后的年画。在出版发行上，出版社对于反映社会主义建设新气象的作品重视不够；古装年画的选题也有重复，印数很大，稿费也存在问题。销售单位订购年画时，常常不能真正了解群众的需要和喜爱，采取合作社包销的办法等，都值得研究。目前，全国各项社会主义建设都在飞跃前进，最能深入农民的年画，也应为农业大跃进服务。许多画家都认为今年应当画一套有关农业发展纲要四十条的作品。蒋兆和说过去自己对年画重视不够，今年一定好好画；李斛从没有画过年画，今年也要争取画一张。许多画家不仅表示要画新年画，而且还表示要向民间传统的年画学习，希望美协能组织民间年画展览供美术工作者观摩。
    此外，文化部、美协和人民美术出版社，在春节前后还组织了年画展览，到河北省完县和唐县等老解放区巡回展览，广泛地听取群众意见，供画家们改进年画创作时参考。
