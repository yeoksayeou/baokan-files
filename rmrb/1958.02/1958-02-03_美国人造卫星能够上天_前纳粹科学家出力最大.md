Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 2nd: Western news agencies reported on February 1st that the US Army was able to launch an artificial satellite using the "Jupiter-C" rocket largely because the Army relied on one hundred and thirty former Nazi German rocket experts led by Braun. These news agencies said that the Army has been using this group of scientists to develop rocket weapons since World War II.

The Associated Press also specifically reported on the situation when the United States abducted Nazi scientists, saying: In 1945, when the Soviet Red Army was rapidly advancing towards Germany, American agents hurriedly arranged a plan to abduct Nazi technicians working at the Peenemünde rocket base on the Baltic coast, and deliberately blew up roads and bridges to prevent the advance of the Soviet Red Army.

The Associated Press said: The US Army placed these people at Fort Bliss in Texas. Since 1949, the US government has naturalized them as American citizens and asked them to research and manufacture "Jupiter" rockets.

　　美国人造卫星能够上天
    前纳粹科学家出力最大
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：西方国家的通讯社2月1日纷纷指出，美国陆军所以能够用“丘辟特C式”火箭发射了一颗人造卫星，在很大程度上由于陆军依赖了以布劳恩为首的一百三十名前纳粹德国的火箭专家。这些通讯社说，陆军从第二次世界大战以来一直在利用这批科学家发展火箭武器。
    美联社还特别报道当初美国劫走纳粹科学家的情况说：1945年，当苏联红军迅速向德国推进时，美国特务人员匆匆忙忙地布置了一个计划，劫走了在波罗的海沿岸佩纳明德火箭基地上工作的纳粹技术人员，并且还故意炸毁了公路和桥梁来阻止苏联红军的推进。
    美联社说：美国陆军把这些人安插在得克萨斯州的勃立斯堡。1949年起，美国政府就使他们归化为美国公民，并且叫他们研究制造“丘辟特”式火箭。
