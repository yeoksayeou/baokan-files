　　The Bugle Call of Spring
　　Xu Guangping

　　The spring in northern China always evokes my love because it is charming and inspiring, and I love its Great Leap Forward. When you step into the beginning of spring, the long-term experience predictions of the farmers are not wrong. Soon the facts will be seen: the buds on the branches, almost invisible, will soon turn into a green, and soon even more, red flowers will fill the trees. After a few days, it seems like a world has changed, becoming a season of singing birds and fragrant flowers. Isn't this a Great Leap Forward of nature?

　　But people's creation of the spring of nature is always earlier than the season, especially this spring. Since last winter, there has been no winter slack in all parts of the country, and everyone has leapt forward into spring. I saw with my own eyes the crowds of people all over the mountains and fields at the Laojuntang and Xihongmen Township construction sites in the suburbs of Beijing, opening up rivers and building reservoirs. From twelve- or thirteen-year-old boys and girls to sixty- or seventy-year-old grandpas and grandmas were mobilized. They call digging reservoirs digging up the roots of poverty, so no wonder they don't care about broken hands and sore feet. Their heroic spirit is: "Transform winter slack into winter busyness, transform the moonlight into the sun." Taking Xihongmen Township as an example, after the completion of this year's water conservancy project, the paddy fields will increase from 380 mu last year to 4,259 mu. With a yield of 700 catties of rice per mu, more than 2.9 million catties of rice will be produced, with an average of 2,400 catties per household. Isn't this a Great Leap Forward?

　　The spring climate makes the young men at the construction site work bare-chested, and makes all the people repel the severe cold and take off their cotton clothes. Isn't this spring coming? At the same time, it also infects everyone who goes to the countryside to visit. The artists perform one section after another, carrying mud and ramming earth. Everyone feels relaxed. Even temporary participants are unwilling to just be spectators. After the farmers and cadres send off the people who came to visit the countryside, gusts of dust rise under their feet, flying so lightly and happily. Groups of three or five people, appearing and disappearing, look like fresh flowers in the mist. Full of energy, they sing and work at the same time, as if celebrating a festival. They brought the spring of all China and gave the people who love peace unparalleled enthusiasm.

　　This is the Great Leap Forward of the spring of 1958! It is truly riding the wind and waves, full of energy; it is also the beginning of the complete and total transformation of customs and continuous education of the Chinese people through labor. Let us all respond to this new battle drum and bugle call. The working people are our good example!

    春的号声
    许广平
    北国的春天，每年都引起我的喜爱，因为它迷人，令人振奋，我喜欢它的跃进。当你踏入立春时节之后，农民们长期经验预告的话没有错，事实不久会看到：树上枝头点点，几不可见的苞芽，转瞬不就变成一片绿色？很快更是红花满树，隔几天就好像换了一个世界，成为鸟语花香的时节。这难道不可以说是大自然的跃进吗？
    但人们创造自然的春天总是比季节更早，特别是今年春天。从去冬全国各地就没有冬闲，都跃进到春天来了。我亲眼看到京郊老君堂、西红门乡工地漫山遍野的人群在开辟河道，修筑水库，从十二、三岁的男女孩子到六、七十岁的老大爷和老大娘都出动了。他们把挖水库叫做挖穷根，无怪手破脚疼都不当一回事了。他们的豪迈气概是：“变冬闲为冬忙，变月亮为太阳”。就拿西红门乡来说，今年水利工程完成后，水田将从去年的三百八十亩增加到四千二百五十九亩，每亩稻谷产量以七百斤计，将产稻谷二百九十多万斤，每户平均得二千四百斤，这不是一个大跃进吗？
    春天的气候使工地的小伙子赤膊夯土，使所有的人们击退了严寒，卸下了棉衣，这不是春天来了吗？同时也感染着每一个下乡访问的人们，艺术家们表演完一段又一段，担泥夯土，大伙全觉得轻松了，临时参加的人也有不愿做参观的了。农民、干部，送完下乡访问的人之后，脚下翻腾起阵阵尘土，飞扬得那么轻松愉快，三三五五的人群，忽隐忽现，眼看着似一朵朵雾里的鲜花，干劲十足地又在一面歌唱一面劳动，好像过节日似的欢腾。他们带来了全中国的春天，也赠送爱好和平的人们以无比热力。
    这是1958年春天的大跃进！真是乘风破浪，干劲十足；也是全中国人民从劳动中彻底的、全部的移风易俗、不断教育自己的开始。大家来响应这新的战鼓与号声吧，劳动人民是我们的好榜样！
