Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch, February 17th: The Party Committee of the Central Government Organs held a promotion meeting on the 16th to review the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, with advanced units such as the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Trade introducing their experiences in carrying out the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. This meeting was, in effect, a competition to see who was more advanced and who had more drive.

    Lu Dong, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, made a vivid speech at the meeting. The leaders and the masses of the Ministry have now been fully mobilized. They believe that whether this anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign is conducted deeply and thoroughly is a fundamental issue related to the speed of the entire socialist construction and whether or not socialism can be built with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. To ensure the complete victory of this movement, the current major enemy is right-leaning conservative thought, and all right-leaning conservative ideas that underestimate the great significance of this movement must be resolutely eliminated.

    The anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is now in full swing, with total mobilization as if participating in a serious battle. Within seven days, the department had already posted more than 60,000 big-character posters exposing various forms of waste, led by leading cadres. On the 15th alone, more than 26,000 big-character posters were produced. The entire movement has shown a surging trend of "rapid momentum, in-depth exposure, opposition from all directions, and flames burning through all directions." The issues raised by the masses ranged from the irrational use of hundreds of millions of yuan in construction investment to criticism of the fact that the agency cafeteria had broken 3,000 bowls in a year. Lu Dong said that these situations show that the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement is, in fact, a major review of the implementation of the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results and building the country with diligence and thrift in all aspects. It has made all the unhealthy tendencies that violate the correct policies of the Central Committee, such as bureaucratism, stagnation, extravagance, and arrogance, fully exposed. The raging fire that has been ignited from all directions through extensive airing of views has made these unhealthy tendencies nowhere to hide. Lu Dong said that if we continue to mobilize the masses to carry out a major debate, a major rectification, and a major reform based on deep airing of views, the final result of this movement will be a real transformation from the economic, political, and ideological aspects to the working methods. It will truly solve the problem of how to implement the line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. And conscientiously implementing this line put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is precisely a fundamental issue related to the speed of the entire socialist construction and the long-term interests of the entire country.

    Lu Dong emphasized that once the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement is carried out in depth, it will inevitably bring about a serious struggle on the political and ideological front to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, to eliminate individualism and establish socialism. The result of the movement will not simply be to plug some economic loopholes, but will achieve significant political gains. He said that for leading cadres, some of the wasteful phenomena revealed by tens of thousands of big-character posters are directly caused by the erroneous ideological style of bureaucratism, subjectivism, or a tendency to show off and compete in extravagance. Some were completely unaware of it beforehand, and only after it was exposed did they break out in a cold sweat and be greatly surprised. No one can be ideologically unmoved in this situation. Some technicians, when designing factories, do not consider the current national economic situation and the socialist construction policy at all, and do not hesitate to waste huge amounts of state funds, seeing the construction of factories as establishing a "monument" for themselves, wanting everything to be large and comprehensive, and unrealistically pursuing mechanization and automation. Lu Dong said that when everyone is involved in this movement and comes to post big-character posters, they cannot but consider what kind of ideas they should establish to deal with wasteful phenomena and from what standpoint they should view the problem.

    Lu Dong also said that when the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement truly plays a role in boosting morale, changing customs, transforming ideas, and finding solutions, all the rules and regulations formulated under the guidance of erroneous ideas that restrict the development of productive forces will inevitably undergo a major reform in this movement, so that they can serve the great leap forward in all aspects and consolidate the achievements of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement.

    Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, said at the meeting that the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and other units has been launched and is doing very well, exposing many wasteful phenomena. Waste is universal, and the saying "clean government department" must be broken. He also emphasized that anti-waste and anti-conservatism is the "Huaihai Campaign" of the rectification movement. If this battle is won, the rectification movement will be close to complete victory. Therefore, any unit must be personally led by the top leader, fully mobilized, and go all out to learn from the experience of advanced units. It is only allowed to do a good job in the movement, and it is not allowed to do a bad job. If it is not done deeply and thoroughly, it will never be allowed to end the campaign hastily.

### 国家机关党委召开检查反浪费反保守的促进会议  上下左右一齐反　四面八方都烧透  冶金部已形成对执行多快好省方针的大检查

    国家机关党委召开检查反浪费反保守的促进会议
    上下左右一齐反　四面八方都烧透
    冶金部已形成对执行多快好省方针的大检查
    本报特约新华社17日专稿　中央国家机关党委16日召开了一次检查反浪费反保守的促进会议，由冶金工业部、对外贸易部等先进单位介绍开展反浪费反保守运动的经验。这次会议实际上是一次比先进、比干劲的会议。
    冶金工业部副部长吕东在会上作了生动的发言。这个部的领导和群众现在已经全面发动起来，他们认为，这次反浪费反保守运动搞得是否深透，是否彻底，是关系到整个社会主义建设的速度、关系到能否多快好省地建设社会主义的根本性问题。要使这个运动获得全胜，当前的大敌就是右倾保守思想，一切对这个运动的巨大意义估计不足的右倾保守思想，必须坚决清除。
    冶金部的反浪费反保守运动现在搞得轰轰烈烈，全体总动员，如同参加一场严重的战斗。这个部在七天的时间内就已由领导干部带头贴出揭发各种浪费现象的大字报六万多张，仅15日这一天，就出了二万六千多张大字报。整个运动出现了“来势迅猛，揭发深透，上下左右一齐反，四面八方都烧透”的汹涌形势。群众提出的问题，大的有对上亿元建设投资使用不合理的揭发，小的有批评机关食堂一年内摔坏三千个碗的事情。吕东说，这些情况说明，反浪费反保守运动事实上是对各方面执行多快好省和勤俭建国方针的一次大检查，它已使得一切违背中央正确方针的官气、暮气、阔气、骄气等歪风邪气得到了一个总暴露，通过大鸣大放从四面八方烧起的漫天烈火，已经把这些歪风邪气照耀得无处藏身。吕东说，如果我们在鸣深放透的基础上继续发动群众来一个大争大辩大整大改，这次运动的最后结果就将从经济上、政治上、思想上直到工作方法上，真正来一个大改观，真正解决了如何贯彻执行又多又快又好又省这条建设社会主义的路线问题。而认真贯彻党中央和毛主席提出的这个路线，正是关系到整个社会主义建设的速度，关系到整个国家利益的长远的根本性问题。
    吕东特别强调地谈到，一旦反浪费反保守运动深入开展下去，就必然要带来政治思想战线上兴无产阶级思想、破资产阶级思想，破个人主义、立社会主义的一场严重斗争，运动的结果决不单纯是堵塞某些经济上的漏洞，而将取得重大的政治上的收获。他说，对领导干部来讲，几万张大字报所揭发出来的浪费现象，有的是直接由于官僚主义、主观主义或者讲排场比阔气的错误思想作风造成的，有的事先毫无所知，直到揭发出来才出一身冷汗，大吃一惊。任何人在这种情况下都不能思想上无所震动的。有的技术人员在设计工厂时，根本不考虑当前国家经济情况和社会主义建设方针，不惜浪费国家的巨额资金，把建设工厂看做是为个人树立“纪念碑”，一切都要贪大求全，不切实际地追求机械化自动化。吕东说，当着一切人都卷入这个运动都来贴大字报的时候，他就不能不考虑自己应该树立怎么样的思想来对待浪费现象，应该从甚么立场出发来看待问题。
    吕东还说，当着反浪费反保守运动真正起到鼓起干劲，移风易俗，改造思想，找出办法的作用以后，那些在错误思想指导下制订出来的束缚生产力发展的一切规章制度，也必然要在这次运动中来个大改革，使之为各方面的大跃进服务，并且把反浪费反保守运动的成果巩固下来。
    国务院秘书长习仲勋在会上说，冶金部等单位的反浪费反保守运动已经开展起来，并且作得很好，揭发出了很多浪费现象，浪费是普遍存在的，“清水衙门”的说法必须打破。他还曾着重指出，反浪费反保守是整风运动的“淮海战役”，这一仗打赢了，整风运动就将接近全胜，因此任何单位必须由第一把手亲自挂帅，全体动员，全力以赴，学习先进单位的经验，只准把运动搞好，不准搞坏，如果搞的不深不透，决不容许草率收兵。
