Xinhua News Agency, 14th - To enable long-distance telephone communication to more broadly meet the communication needs of our nation's economic development and the general public, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has decided to adopt the following two new measures:

(1) Starting from this year's Spring Festival (February 17th), on the seven holidays stipulated by the State Council and on Sundays (if a Sunday is brought forward or postponed, it will be in accordance with local government regulations), all types of long-distance calls between Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, provincial capitals, and the capitals of each autonomous region (excluding Tibet) will trial a full-day half-price charging method (paging calls between 7:00 and 20:00 will also be charged half-price; however, calls between 0:00 and 7:00 in the morning and 20:00 and 24:00 in the evening will still be charged at full price).

(2) Starting from February 21st of this year, the discount hours for nationwide nighttime discount telephone calls will be changed from 0:00 to 7:00 daily to 20:00 (i.e., 8:00 pm) to 7:00 am the next morning. All types of long-distance calls (excluding paging calls) connected during this discount period will be charged half-price. Conference calls, scheduled calls, advance notice calls, and broadcasting services will also be charged half-price.
