    Rectify the Style of Wasteful Spending in Agricultural Cooperatives
    (I)
    In Dongtai, Dafeng, Jianhu, and other counties in Jiangsu Province, some agricultural cooperatives, after a good harvest, emphasized extravagance and blindly spent money, forgetting the principle of running the cooperatives with diligence and thrift, which created a negative impact among the masses. The Lishe Agricultural Cooperative in Dongtai County emphasized standardization and built offices for both the cooperative and the teams, using more than 9,000 yuan of public accumulation. In Shen灶 Township, Dafeng County, a large auditorium was built on Shen灶 Street at a cost of more than 1,500 yuan, which was jointly borne by 38 agricultural cooperatives in the township. According to a survey of 52 agricultural cooperatives in Jianhu County, expenses such as building offices, purchasing office furniture, and buying loudspeakers amounted to more than 18,000 yuan, accounting for 36.5% of the total expenses of the cooperatives. These are all unnecessary expenses that could have been saved. At present, a campaign against waste is being carried out in various places. Therefore, I suggest that party organizations in various places take the inspection of the implementation of the policy of running cooperatives with diligence and thrift as one of the contents of the rectification campaign, further strengthen education for the vast number of cadres and masses, and strive to achieve the Forty Articles ahead of schedule. Qin Kui
    (II)
    In 1957, the Shuanglou Village Agricultural Cooperative in Anling Township, Jingxian County, Hebei Province, spent more than 190 yuan on travel expenses alone. The cooperative stipulated that cadres and masses on official business for the cooperative would receive a subsidy of 0.3 yuan per day, which was later changed to 0.4 yuan, and finally to actual reimbursement. For example, Qi Yuehai, the deputy director, spent 5 yuan on food and drink on one trip to Jingxian County, which was twelve *li* away, to settle accounts, and it was charged to the cooperative's sideline account. Not only that, according to last year's statistics, the cooperative consumed more than 30 *jin* of alcohol, 38 *jin* of peanuts, pork, beef, roast chicken, etc., for a total cost of more than 120 yuan. What is surprising is that the cooperative spent 20 yuan of public funds to buy roast chicken, preserved sausage, and liquor in Dezhou, which is forty *li* away, and returned to the cooperative for a big feast. In 1955, the cooperative had already bought a bicycle, and last year they bought another one. According to statistics, the cost of repairing bicycles alone last year was more than 30 yuan. The total amount of money wasted and spent indiscriminately by this cooperative was more than 1,200 yuan. Calculated on the basis of the total population of more than 300 people in the village, each person received about 4 yuan less. If this money were used for water conservancy construction, what a great role it would play in the great leap forward in agriculture in 1958! Liu Zongxin

    农业社挥霍浪费之风要整顿
    （一）
    江苏省的东台、大丰、建湖等县，有部分农业社在丰收以后，讲究排场，盲目开支，忘记了勤俭办社的方针，在群众中造成了不良影响。东台县李舍农业社强调正规化，社、队都砌了办公室，动用公共积累九千多元。大丰县沈灶乡，在沈灶小街上，修建了一座大礼堂，开支一千五百多元，由全乡三十八个农业社共同负担。建湖县据五十二个农业社的了解，砌办公室、购置办公家具、买扩音器等，即共开支一万八千多元，占社内总开支的36.5％。这些都是不必要的开支，完全可以节约。目前各地正在开展反浪费运动，因此，我建议各地党组织，把检查勤俭办社方针执行情况，作为整风的内容之一，进一步对广大干群加强教育，为提前实现四十条纲要而斗争。　沁葵
    （二）
    河北省景县安陵乡双楼村农业社，在1957年内，光旅差费就开支一百九十多元。社内规定不论干部和群众，因社公出差每天补助三角，后改为四角，最后又改为实报实销。如副社长齐月海，因赴十二里路远的景县城里去结算账目，一次就大吃大喝花了五元，出在社内的副业账上。不但如此，据去年一年统计，该社共喝酒就有三十多斤、花生三十八斤，猪、牛肉、烧鸡等，共计花款一百二十多元，使人惊奇的是用社内公款二十元到四十里外的德州市买了的烧鸡、酱肠、烧酒等回社大吃大喝。1955年社内已经买了一辆自行车，去年又买了一辆，据统计去年光修理自行车，就花三十多元。这个社浪费和胡乱开支的钱共有一千二百多元，以全村总人口三百多人计算，每人约少分四元，如果把这些钱用到水利建设上去，对1958年农业大跃进将起多么大的作用啊！　刘宗信
