    Chenggi Village Glorified for Being Rat-Free
    Jian Chengfu
    Not long ago, I visited Chenggi Village in Daitou Township, Putian, Fujian. The warm winter sun shone on this village, nestled against the mountains and facing the sea, making it exceptionally beautiful. Upon entering the village, people were immediately attracted by the excellent environmental hygiene. Everywhere was clean and tidy, and every household had a red certificate of merit posted on their door, proclaiming "Glorified for Being Rat-Free."

    Miserable and Terrifying Past

    This village had countless tales of misery and suffering before liberation! The older generation can't help but shed tears when talking about the painful and terrifying life of the past. A folk song has long been circulating in the village: "People in Chenggi Village are terrified, the rat plague is rampant, yesterday a daughter died, today a son dies, it's hard to survive past August." In the era of the cruel rule of the feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang reactionary government, there were rats everywhere in the village, the big ones weighing ten taels and a foot long. During the day, they bit chickens and ducks, and even pigs; at night, they squeaked and fought all night long, chasing and scurrying endlessly, disturbing adults and children, preventing them from sleeping peacefully, and sometimes even crawling into beds to bite people. Clothes and furniture were bitten and dragged away to make rat nests; it goes without saying that crops were ravaged, and in severe cases, 40% of a mu of wheat would be lost.

    The most terrifying thing back then was the prevalence of the bubonic plague. Every year when the plague broke out in autumn, it claimed many lives. According to historical records, from 1901 in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty to the Kuomintang rule, the village suffered fifty outbreaks of the plague in a row. Out of two thousand patients, more than one thousand five hundred people died; no less than a hundred families were wiped out. The Zhang Liugu family suffered from the plague, and there was no way to treat it. All twenty-three members of the family died, leaving only an empty house. Lin Hongtong, Lin Kexian, and other six families lived in the same house, and they were also infected by the plague, resulting in the successive deaths of thirty-seven people in the house. Seventy-eight-year-old Fan Jinzhu had eleven biological children, all of whom died of the plague within two years. In such a miserable and terrifying era, the reactionary rulers, in addition to forcing the people to pay grain and serve as soldiers, simply didn't care about the plague. When epidemics broke out, the villagers had no choice but to pray to gods and Buddhas, wasting time and money, but the plague continued to spread.

    Launching a Mass Rat-Catching Campaign

    Not long after liberation, the Party and the government launched a patriotic health campaign in Chenggi Village, quickly controlling the spread of the plague. After the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), Putian County, District, and Township established pest elimination (four pests) and disease prevention committees. The County Party Committee sent a District Party Committee member to the Nongfeng Cooperative (the entire village formed the Chenggi Nongfeng Advanced Agricultural Cooperative during the high tide of cooperativization) to lead rat-catching while engaging in production. At the same time, a full-time rat prevention work team was assigned to assist in carrying out rat-catching work. By October 1956, Chenggi Village was officially designated as a rat extermination pilot village, requiring that by January 1957, on the basis of the original rat density of 92%, it would reach the level of a basically rat-free village (rat density of 5%).

    The work began. Through propaganda and education, the masses had an urgent desire to eliminate rats, but there were many problems. Some people didn't believe that rats could be eliminated, saying: No one has ever asked us to kill rats in history, and no one has ever heard that rats can be eliminated; some said that there are so many rats and fleas in our village that it's impossible to eliminate them; and some people even resolutely refused to do it. But the majority of the masses supported it. They said: Chairman Mao's words are always effective, he says what he means, and we must listen to Chairman Mao. But when action was taken, the superstitious ideas of some people got in the way. When they caught "insect-eating rats," they secretly took them outdoors, prayed to the rats, and let them go, saying that these rats were "divine rats, treasures."

    The resistance of old ideas affected the progress of the campaign. What to do? The Township Party Branch and the rat prevention work team organized forces from the Communist Youth League, women, militia, and schools, and in addition to using various propaganda tools such as slides, radio, cartoons, and parades, they also conducted propaganda through various meetings and door-to-door visits. The content of the propaganda focused on the tragic experiences of families or neighbors who had suffered from rats, explaining that rats were the medium of plague, and mobilizing the masses to use methods of recollection, comparison, grievance, and detailed accounting for education. Zhang Yalin, who suffered severely, had thirteen members of her family, spanning three generations, who died of the plague, resulting in the tragic situation of the family being cut off without descendants and without support. Her personal account touched people's hearts and improved the masses' understanding. On this basis, the Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists led the masses to vigorously catch rats. In just over twenty days, more than seven thousand rats were caught, reversing the incorrect idea that the masses thought that rats could not be caught. A mass rat-catching campaign was launched. Even eighty-nine-year-old Zhang Yalin started catching rats and caught twenty-five rats.

    At the same time, the Party Branch listed rat-catching and grain protection as one of the measures to increase production. The cooperative also uniformly arranged labor, organizing semi-labor and non-labor elderly and children to form rat-catching commando teams, catching rats, poisoning rats, and digging and blocking holes day and night. They summarized and promoted the advanced experiences of the masses, and the masses also exchanged rat-catching techniques with each other. When the rats in the households were almost eliminated, they shifted the main force to the fields to eliminate field rats, and carried out evaluation and competitions. This dual approach of internal and external searches ensured the complete elimination of rats.

    By August 18th of last year, a total of 21,014 rats had been caught in the village. After inspection, it was announced that the village was basically rat-free (rat density was 4.9%).

    Chenggi Village Today

    Chenggi Village today has changed its appearance. Due to the rat-catching campaign and the elimination of rats, the plague has disappeared in the village, and tsutsugamushi disease has also been eliminated. Now, every household in the village is very clean, the rat holes are blocked tightly, and no garbage can be seen in front of or behind the houses. People happily said: "The Communist Party led us to eliminate the rats, ensuring peace for our descendants for thousands of generations, which is better than distributing relief funds." Lin Meizhi, who is over seventy years old, had her husband, son, and daughter-in-law all die of illness before liberation. Now her adopted son has married a wife and has two grandsons, and the whole family is safe and sound. She happily said: "The Communist Party has made thousands of contributions, and eliminating rats is also a contribution."

    Now everyone in the village consciously and habitually implements several consolidation systems formulated by the cooperative: 1. Rat situation reporting system, to detect and deal with problems in a timely manner; 2. Every 15th and 30th of the month is a village-wide cleaning day, with mutual inspection and supervision the next day; 3. If there are problems, the cooperative members and the masses discuss and find solutions themselves. Now, as soon as a rat is discovered, the masses will unite to encircle and suppress it.

    The people of Chenggi Village are not satisfied with their existing achievements. After basically eliminating the rats, they are full of confidence and want to continue to eliminate mosquitoes, flies, and sparrows, and strive to become a "four-free" village.

    澄岐村无鼠光荣
    简成富
    不久前，我访问了福建莆田埭头乡澄岐村。冬日和煦的阳光照耀着这个傍山面海的村庄，显得分外美丽。一进村子，人们就被这里良好的环境卫生吸引住了。这里到处打扫得干干净净的，家家户户门前都贴着“无鼠光荣”的红奖状。
    凄惨恐怖的往事
    这个村庄，在解放前有过诉不尽的悲惨辛酸的往事！老一辈的人谈起往日痛苦恐怖的生活无不伤心流泪。很早以来村里就流传着这样一句民谣：“澄岐村里人心慌，流行鼠瘟闹惶惶，昨朝死女今死男，在世难跨八月关。”在封建王朝和国民党反动政府残酷统治的年代里，村中到处是老鼠，大的一头有十两重、尺把长。白天，它们咬鸡鸭，甚至咬猪；晚上，整夜吱吱的打架，追窜不休，吵得大人小孩不能安睡，有时甚至钻到床上咬人；衣物、家具被咬坏了拖去做鼠窝；庄稼被糟蹋更不用说了，严重时一亩小麦要损失四成。
    当年最恐怖的就是鼠疫流行，每年秋季鼠疫一发生，就夺去了不少生命。据历史记载：从清朝光绪年间的1901年到国民党统治时期，村里连续发生了五十次鼠疫，两千个患者中，死亡了一千五百多人；灭门绝户者不下百家。张刘古一家患了鼠疫，无法医治，全家大小二十三口全都死去，只剩下一座空房子。林红铜、林科先等六户同住一屋，也因鼠疫互相传染，全屋三十七人相继死亡。七十八岁的范金珠，有十一个亲生儿女，在两年时间内，全都死于鼠疫。在这样凄惨恐怖的年代里，反动统治者除向人民逼粮抽丁外，对鼠疫根本就不过问。疫病流行时，村里人只好求神拜佛，误工花钱，鼠疫还是不断流行。
    掀起群众性捕鼠运动
    解放后不多久，党和政府在澄岐村开展了爱国卫生运动，迅速控制了鼠疫流行；到全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布后，莆田县、区、乡即成立除害（四害）防病委员会组织，县委派出一个区委委员到农锋社（合作化高潮时全村组成一个澄岐农锋高级农业社），边搞生产边领导捕鼠，同时配备了专职的鼠防工作组，协助开展捕鼠工作。至1956年10月正式确定澄岐村为灭鼠试点村，要求到1957年1月在原有鼠密度92％的基础上，达到基本无鼠村（鼠密度5％）。
    工作开始了，通过宣传教育，群众对灭鼠要求迫切，但问题不少。有些群众不相信老鼠可以消灭，说：有史以来都没有人叫我们灭鼠，更没听过这老鼠是可以消灭的；有的说，我们村里老鼠、跳蚤这么多，无法消灭；更有些人甚至坚决不干。但大多数群众还是拥护的。他们说：毛主席讲的话句句灵验，讲到做到，一定要听毛主席的话。可是一行动，这中间有些人的迷信思想又作怪了，当他们抓到“食虫鼠”时，就偷偷地送到户外，对老鼠祝祷一番就放走了，他们说这种老鼠是“神鼠、财宝”。
    旧思想的阻力，影响着运动的开展。怎么办呢？乡党支部、鼠防工作组组织了团、妇女、民兵、学校等各方面力量，除运用幻灯、广播、漫画、游行等多种宣传工具外，还通过各种会议以及挨家挨户进行宣传。宣传内容多是以自家或邻居受害惨痛情况，说明老鼠是疫患的媒介，还发动群众用回忆、对比、诉苦、算细账方法进行教育。受害严重的张亚林，她一家子孙三代十三人患鼠疫死光，造成断宗绝嗣，无依无靠的惨境。她现身说法，打动了人心，提高了群众的认识。在这基础上再通过党、团员和积极分子带动群众大力捕鼠，在短短的二十几天中，就捕鼠七千多头，扭转了群众认为老鼠抓不了等不正确的思想，群众性的捕鼠运动展开了，连八十九岁的张亚林也动手捕鼠，先后抓到二十五头。
    与此同时，党支部把捕鼠保粮列为增产措施之一。社里也统一安排劳力，把半劳力和无劳力的老人孩子组织起来，成立捕鼠突击队，日夜捕鼠、毒鼠、挖穴塞洞。总结和推广群众的先进经验，群众也互相交流捕鼠技术。在户内家鼠消灭得差不多的时候，又把主要力量转向田野消灭野鼠，并展开评比竞赛。这样内外搜捕，双管齐下的做法，保证了鼠类的彻底消灭。
    到去年8月18日止，全村共计捕到两万一千零十四头老鼠，经过检查，宣布为基本无鼠村（鼠密度为4.9％）。
    今日的澄岐村
    今日的澄岐村已经改变了面貌，由于开展捕鼠运动，消灭了老鼠，村里鼠疫绝迹，恙虫病也消除了。现在，村里家家户户都十分干净，鼠洞堵塞得牢牢的，屋前屋后全都看不到垃圾。人们高兴的说：“共产党领导我们消灭老鼠，子孙千代万代保平安，胜过发放救济款。”七十多岁的林妹治，解放前她的丈夫、儿子、媳妇全都得病死去，如今她收养的儿子娶了媳妇，又添了两个孙子，一家人都平平安安的。她高兴地说：“共产党领导千功万功，消灭老鼠也是一功。”
    现在村里人人都自觉而又习惯地执行着社里制订的几条巩固制度：一、鼠情报告制度，及时发现及时处理；二、每逢15、30日为全村打扫卫生日，次日互相检查监督；三、如有问题由社员群众自己讨论想办法解决。现在只要发现老鼠，群众就会联合围剿。
    澄岐村人民并不满足于现有成绩，在基本消灭了老鼠后，他们满怀信心，要继续消灭蚊、蝇、麻雀，争取成为“四无”村。
