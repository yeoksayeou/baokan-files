Xinhua News Agency, February 13th: After five more years of effort, China's annual aquatic product output will reach 8 million tons, rising from fourth place in the world to first place.

The Second Five-Year Plan for a Great Leap Forward in Aquatic Production, preliminarily drafted at the recently concluded National Aquatic Work Conference, stipulates that aquatic product output will reach 3.52 million tons in 1958, an increase of 570,000 tons compared to last year; by 1962, it will reach 8 million tons, which is 3 million tons more than Japan, the country with the highest aquatic product output in the world. By then, even if China's population grows to 700 million, each person can still consume an average of about 23 catties (approximately 11.5 kg) of aquatic products per year.

The conference believes that there are conditions for realizing a Great Leap Forward in aquatic product production. First of all, China's aquatic resources are extremely rich. According to statistics, the total freshwater area available for aquaculture is about 60 million mu; the shallow sea area available for aquaculture is about 7 million mu, while the currently utilized area accounts for only 25% of the freshwater area and only 13% of the shallow sea area. Secondly, more than 4.5 million professional fishermen have joined cooperatives. They have rich production experience, and their enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high under the encouragement of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). In addition, the new high tide of industrial and agricultural production will also promote the development of aquatic undertakings. Under such conditions, as long as we earnestly implement the guidelines proposed by the conference, mobilize all positive factors during the Second Five-Year Plan period, further rely on cooperatives, boldly mobilize the vast number of fishermen and farmers, universally develop freshwater and marine aquaculture, actively open up new fishing grounds, and rationally utilize existing resources to increase the marine and freshwater catches of state-owned and cooperative enterprises, it is entirely possible to realize a Great Leap Forward in aquatic product production.

The conference believes that marine and freshwater fishing, which used to occupy a leading position in China's aquatic product production, will continue to be an important part of the aquatic undertaking in the future, and must be actively developed under the principle of neither wasting resources nor protecting and cultivating resources.

The conference believes that China has great potential for developing shallow sea and freshwater aquaculture, and that aquaculture is a production undertaking with low investment, quick results, and high returns. Therefore, developing shallow sea and freshwater aquaculture at this stage is the broadest and most effective way to develop aquatic product production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. In order to vigorously develop this production, we must first rapidly expand the stocking area. All water areas that can be stocked should be fully planned and gradually stocked, especially ponds and small lakes, which should strive to be fully stocked within one or two years. By 1962, the freshwater stocking area is required to expand to more than 80% of the total available area, and the marine aquaculture area is required to expand to 60% of the available area.

The conference pointed out that in order to strive for a Great Leap Forward in aquatic production, we must better rely on cooperatives and the vast number of fishermen. An extremely important issue in relying on cooperatives to develop production is that we must ensure the continuous growth of the cooperative's public accumulation, adhere to the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, emphasize increasing accumulation, and implement the principle of accumulating more in years of good harvest, less in years of poor harvest, and not accumulating in disaster years. Another important issue is to strengthen specific guidance to cooperatives. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, leaders in fishing areas should regard consolidating cooperatives as their primary task.

During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De gave instructions on aquatic work at the conference. Cheng Zihua, Director of the Fifth Office of the State Council, also spoke at the conference.

### 五年后我国水产品产量将跃居世界第一

    五年后我国水产品产量将跃居世界第一
    据新华社13日讯　再经过五年的努力，我国水产品年产量将达到八百万吨，由世界第四位跃居为世界第一位。
    最近结束的全国水产工作会议初步拟定的第二个五年计划水产生产大跃进规划规定：1958年水产品产量达到三百五十二万吨，比去年增加五十七万吨；到1962年达到八百万吨，比现在世界上水产品产量最高的日本多三百万吨。到那时，我国人口即使发展到七亿，每人每年平均也可以吃到水产品二十三斤左右。
    这次会议认为，实现水产品生产大跃进是有条件的。首先是我国的水产资源极为丰富，据统计，全国可供养殖的淡水面积约有六千万亩；可供养殖的浅海面积约有七百万亩，而现在利用的面积淡水只占25％，浅海只占13％。其次，有四百五十多万专业渔民参加了合作社，他们有着丰富的生产经验，在全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的鼓舞下，生产积极性空前高涨。另外，工农业生产的新高潮对于水产事业的发展也将起促进作用。在这样的条件下，只要认真贯彻会议提出的方针，在第二个五年计划期间调动一切积极因素，进一步依靠合作社，放手发动广大渔民和农民，普遍开展淡水养殖和海水养殖事业，积极开辟新渔场，合理利用原有资源，以提高国营和合作社的海洋和淡水捕获量，实现水产品生产大跃进是完全可能的。
    会议认为，过去在我国水产品生产中占首要地位的海洋和淡水捕捞，今后仍然是水产事业中的一个重要组成部分，必须在贯彻既不浪费资源，又能保护并培养资源的原则下，积极地予以发展。
    会议认为，我国发展浅海、淡水养殖事业的潜力很大，同时养殖事业又是一项投资少，收效快，收益大的生产事业。因此，在现阶段发展浅海、淡水养殖，是又多、又快、又好、又省地发展水产生产的最广阔和最有效的途径。为了大力发展这项生产，首先必须迅速扩大放养面，凡是能够放养的水面，都应当作出全面规划，逐步放养起来，特别是池塘和小型湖泊，应当争取在一两年内全部放养。到1962年，淡水放养面积要求扩大到全部可养面积的80％以上，海水养殖面积要求扩大到可养面积的60％。
    会议指出，为了争取水产生产大跃进，必须更好地依靠合作社和广大渔民。依靠合作社发展生产的一个极为重要的问题，是必须保证合作社的公共积累不断增长，必须坚持勤俭办社的方针，强调增加积累，贯彻按丰产多积，欠产少积，灾年不积的原则。另一个重要的问题，是要加强对合作社的具体指导。在第二个五年计划期间，渔区领导应当把巩固合作社作为首要工作。
    会议期间，朱德副主席曾到会对水产工作作了指示。国务院第五办公室主任程子华也在会上讲了话。
