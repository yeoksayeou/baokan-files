Plugging Capitalist Loopholes in Pig Raising
    Hu Jian
      Wangcheng County in Hunan Province, which ranks first in the country in pig raising with an average of 6.77 pigs per household last year, has decided to actively develop collective pig raising in agricultural cooperatives while continuing to consolidate private pig raising, in order to reverse the capitalist tendencies of some wealthy commune members whose income from private pig raising exceeds their income from the collective economy, and to gradually balance the ratio of public and private pig raising. (Editor's note: Excessive household pig raising inevitably fosters capitalist ideas among commune members and harms the collective economy of agricultural cooperatives. This is clearly evident from the report from Wangcheng County. Now, Wangcheng County has decided to actively develop collective pig raising to gradually balance public and private pig raising, which is good. Wangcheng County's approach has the same basic starting point as the principle of "cooperative raising as the main focus, household raising as supplementary" proposed by Xushui County, and is worth considering by other regions.)
    This year, the number of collectively raised pigs in the county will increase from more than 70,000 last year to 250,000, and the proportion of collectively raised pigs will rise from 10.5% of the total number of privately raised pigs last year to 35.7%, gradually achieving a situation where collective pig raising takes the leading position in the development of pig production. This year, the county's more than 700,000 mu of land will have an average of one pig's worth of manure fertilizer per mu, and the grain yield per mu is required to reach 800 jin, an increase of 50% over last year.
    Last year, Wangcheng County raised more than 660,000 pigs, almost double the number in 1956, but the county's total grain output decreased by more than 10 million jin compared to 1956. There are many reasons for the grain reduction, among which the main reason was the right-leaning tendency in the leadership's thinking, failure to strengthen specific leadership and political and ideological education on private pig raising in a timely manner, and failure to pay attention to timely launch struggles against capitalist spontaneous forces in issues such as pig raising and manure accumulation. Some wealthy commune members have sufficient funds and labor, with some households raising as many as 50 or 60 pigs, and their income from pig raising greatly exceeds their labor remuneration in the cooperative. Therefore, they are not interested in the cooperative's production, which also affects other commune members' lack of enthusiasm for work. Some people openly stated: "Working hard in the fields for a year is not as good as raising a big fat pig at home." The Yanlong Cooperative has 110 households, with an average of more than 10 pigs per household, and their income from private pig raising exceeds their labor remuneration in the cooperative by 40%. Out of more than 180 laborers in the cooperative, often only 50 or so would work, with each laborer averaging only 85 workdays for the whole year. A large amount of survey material shows that less than 30% of the fertilizer accumulated from pig raising in the county last year was actually used in the fields of the cooperative. Less than 3% of the cash income from commune members' pig raising last year was invested in the cooperative for expanding production.
    Due to some commune members immersing themselves in pig raising and the cooperative's lack of labor, cultivation was rough. Last year, the county's double-cropping rice decreased by 100,000 mu compared to 1956, and 120,000 mu of late rice was not transplanted in time. These are all reasons for the grain reduction.
    Since last winter, Wangcheng County, in conjunction with the rural socialist great debate, the party rectification, the youth league rectification, and the cooperative rectification, has launched struggles against capitalist spontaneous forces, and has widely conducted propaganda and education among commune members on “raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, accumulating fertilizer to increase production, and increasing production to raise more pigs.” At the same time, it has taken many specific measures to plug the capitalist loopholes in pig raising. First, agricultural cooperatives throughout the county have arranged the cooperative's and the households' production in sections and comprehensively. According to the requirements of the production plan, they have determined the basic labor tasks that commune members must complete throughout the year, and stipulated that 80% of the household fertilizer be invested in the cooperative at a discounted price. As of January 20, the county had purchased more than 3 million dan of pig manure from commune members, an increase of 17 times compared to the same period in 1956. The winter production basic labor day plan has also been specifically arranged to households in 90% of the cooperatives. The basic labor days for water conservancy that each laborer should complete alone is 44, double the number in 1956. Now, more than 200,000 people are accumulating fertilizer and repairing water conservancy projects every day, accounting for 137% of the number of people who should be working in the county. Many women who did not work in the past are now working. Winter production is better than any year before.
    Second, adjust the fodder land appropriately and do not allow other cash crops to be planted on the fodder land. Resolutely implement the principle of "self-cultivation, self-sufficiency" for fodder. The state-subsidized concentrated feed is only supplied to poor peasant households in difficulty and "five guarantees" households, and the feed for other public and private pig raising is solved by themselves. According to surveys in cooperatives such as Fanshen, the wealthy households who raise too many private pigs have slightly reduced their pig raising, while the number of pigs raised by poor and lower-middle peasants has greatly increased.
    Third, on the basis of continuing to consolidate private pig raising, actively develop collective pig raising, so that every cooperative raises pigs and every team has a pig farm. Develop the collective economy of agricultural cooperatives from all aspects, requiring commune members to have about 80% of their annual income from the collective economy of the cooperative, in order to consolidate the rural socialist position.

    堵塞养猪中资本主义漏洞
    胡坚
      去年平均每户养猪六点七七
  头、养猪居全国第一位的湖南省望城县，为了扭转某些富裕社员由于私人养猪收入超过从集体经济得来的收入，而产生的资本主义倾向，决定在继续巩固私人养猪的基础上，积极发展农业社集体养猪，以逐步平衡公私养猪比例。（编者按：户养猪过多，势必助长社员的资本主义思想，使农业社的集体经济受到损失。这从望城县的报道中已经看得十分明显。现在，望城县决定积极发展集体养猪事业，以逐步平衡公私养猪事业，这是好的。望城县的做法和徐水县提出的社养为主，户养为辅的方针基本出发点有相同之处，值得各地参考。）
    今年全县集体养猪将由去年七万多头发展到二十五万头，集体养猪比重将由去年占私人养猪总数10.5％上升到35.7％，逐步做到在发展生猪生产中，集体养猪居于领导地位。今年全县七十多万亩田平均每亩有一头猪的粪肥，每亩产粮要求达到八百斤，比去年增产五成。
    去年望城县养猪六十六万多头，比1956年增加将近一倍，可是全县粮食总产量却比1956年减产一千多万斤。粮食减产的原因很多，其中主要是领导思想上的右倾，没有及时加强对私人养猪的具体领导和政治思想教育工作，没有注意在养猪积肥等问题上及时向资本主义自发势力开展斗争。有些富裕社员资金足、劳力多，最多有一户养五、六十头猪的，养猪收入大大超过他们在社里的劳动报酬，因此对社里的生产就不感兴趣，也影响到其他社员不积极出工。有的人就公开提出：“辛辛苦苦作一年田，还不如在家里养一头大肥猪。”盐龙社有一百一十户，平均每户养猪十多头，私人养猪收入超过社里劳动报酬40％。全社一百八十多个劳动力，经常只有五十多人出工，平均每个劳力全年只做八十五个工。大量的调查材料说明，去年全县养猪积的肥料，真正投到社里下田的还不到30％。去年全县社员养猪收入的现金，投到社里扩大生产的不到3％。
    由于部分社员埋头养猪，社里劳力不足，耕作粗糙，去年全县双季稻比1956年少十万亩；十二万亩晚稻没有赶上季节插。这都是粮食减产的原因。
    去年冬季以来，望城县结合农村社会主义大辩论，结合整党、整团和整社工作，向资本主义自发势力开展斗争，并广泛地向社员进行
  “养猪积肥，积肥增产，增产再养猪”的宣传教育，同时采取许多具体措施，堵塞养猪中的资本主义漏洞。首先，全县各农业社分段全面地安排社里和家庭的生产，根据生产规划的要求，确定社员全年必须完成的基本劳动的任务，并确定以80％的家肥折价投资给社。到1月20日止，全县已收购社员猪粪三百多万担，比1956年同期增加十七倍。冬季生产基本劳动日方案，也有90％的社具体布置到了户。单是每个劳动力应完成的水利基本劳动日就有四十四个，比1956年增加一倍。现在，每天有二十多万人积肥、修水利，占全县应出工人数137％，许多过去不出工的妇女都出工了。冬季生产比任何一年都搞得好。
    其次，适当调整饲料地，不允许在饲料地上种其他经济作物。坚决贯彻饲料“自种、自给”的方针，国家补助的精饲料，只供应贫农困难户和“五保”户，其他公、私养猪的饲料都由自己解决。根据翻身等社调查，这样一来，私人养猪过多的富裕户，养猪略有减少，而贫农和下中农养猪数量则大为增加。
    再次，在继续巩固私人养猪的基础上，积极发展集体养猪事业，做到社社养猪，队队有养猪场。从各方面发展农业社集体经济，要求社员全年收入约有80％来自社的集体经济，以巩固农村社会主义阵地。
