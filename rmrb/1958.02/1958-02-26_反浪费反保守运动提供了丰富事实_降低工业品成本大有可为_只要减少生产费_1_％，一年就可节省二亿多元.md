Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Luo Feng reports: Further exploring the potential to reduce the cost of industrial products is a crucial aspect of the current effort by factories and mines to implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily. It is also an important way to strive for excellence, improve enterprise management, and increase socialist accumulation.

**Reducing Costs is the General Sign of Improved Management Level**

This is the view reached by relevant departments after studying the recent situation of the anti-waste struggle. After emphasizing the tremendous achievements of China's increase production and practice economy movement in recent years, comrades from relevant departments pointed out that the scale of industrial production has expanded unprecedentedly. There are now more than 60,000 state-owned and joint state-private industrial enterprises included in the national plan. Last year, the total industrial output value (excluding handicrafts) reached more than 56 billion yuan. Therefore, further strengthening the management of existing enterprises has become a pressing and important task. The reduction of product costs in enterprises is the general sign of improved management and an important source of increasing socialist accumulation. At present, the total production cost of state-owned and local state-owned industries alone is more than 20 billion yuan a year. If 1% is saved, it would be more than 200 million yuan. In fact, the potential in this area is very large. As long as it is vigorously tapped, a large amount of funds can be accumulated for the country.

**Saving Raw Materials, Fuel, and Energy Consumption**

The greatest potential for reducing the cost of industrial products lies in the consumption of raw materials, fuel, and energy. According to statistics, this aspect accounts for about 70% of the total cost of industrial products in China. Therefore, comrades from relevant departments believe that saving costs in this area is of decisive significance for reducing the cost of industrial products. The main problem currently is that the consumption quota of raw materials for producing the same products varies greatly between different factories and mines and different regions. For example, some factories use only 400 kilograms of standard coal to generate 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, while some factories use more than 1,000 kilograms. The amount of metal materials consumed to produce one ton of open-hearth steel has reached 1,093 kilograms in some factories, while the highest is more than 1,186 kilograms. The coke quota required for Anshan Iron and Steel Company to produce one ton of pig iron is 711 kilograms, while Longyan Iron Mine requires 1,018 kilograms. Shixian Paper Mill only needs 5.522 cubic meters of raw wood per ton of bleached wood pulp, while Kaishantun Paper Mill requires 6.166 cubic meters; Yingkou Paper Mill consumes 1,931 kilograms per ton of bleached reed pulp, while Jinzhou Paper Mill requires 2,052 kilograms. The amount of cotton used for spinning one piece of yarn is 192.2 kilograms at the lowest nationwide, and still around 196.3 kilograms at the highest. In the mechanical manufacturing process, the amount of metal cutting is generally too large. If the finished weight of metal parts is compared with the weight of the blank, the remaining material can reach 60% in some cases. Now, there are already tens of thousands of industrial products in the country. If the consumption quota of raw materials for each product strives to reach the average advanced level, the funds saved for the country will be very considerable.

**Replacing Expensive Raw Materials with Cheaper Ones**

In industrial production, replacing expensive raw materials with cheaper ones, especially those lacking in the country, is of great significance. However, according to comrades from relevant departments, this important economic measure has not been given enough attention by all factories and mines in the past few years. For example, in the coal industry, the measures of replacing pit wood and raw wood supports with cement sheds and metal pillars, which have long been proposed, have not been universally promoted. Some people believe that if coal mines nationwide use 430,000 cement sheds and 100,000 metal pillars this year, the country can save 216,000 cubic meters of pit wood and save 4.52 million yuan. In the power industry, the method of using low-quality coal instead of good coal for power generation has also been promoted for several years, but it is still not promoted enough. If the national power industry adopts this method and appropriately handles the ratio of low-quality coal to good coal, a total of 2.4 million tons of good coal can be saved. In the machinery industry, the measures of replacing scarce non-ferrous metals with metals with larger output have not been promoted very well. In the production of this department, simply replacing copper with aluminum or steel wherever possible can save a huge amount of money for the country.

**Utilization of By-products and Waste Materials**

In the past few years, not enough attention has been paid to the utilization of by-products and waste materials. Comrades from relevant departments also pointed out many facts: in the smelting of non-ferrous metals, many non-ferrous metals have not been recovered; such as copper, lead, silver, and cobalt in tungsten ore, cobalt and sulfur in molybdenum ore, and silver and cadmium in lead ore. The economic significance of these valuable metals is conceivable if the recovery work is well organized (including increasing the necessary equipment). In the coking industry, more than 300 kinds of chemicals urgently needed by the country can be recovered. Last year, China produced about 8 million tons of coking coal. In addition to being able to produce more than 700 kilograms of coke per ton of coking coal, it can also extract about 35 kilograms of coal tar and 300 cubic meters of coke oven gas. Coal tar is the main raw material for manufacturing plastics, synthetic fibers, and dyes, and coke oven gas can be used to make synthetic ammonia, chlorinated alkanes, and ethanol. However, at present, except for Anshan Iron and Steel, most other iron and steel plants and coking plants have not made rational use of these important by-products.

**Reducing the Defective Product Rate**

The loss of defective products is also an important reason why the cost of many industrial products cannot be reduced. Comrades from relevant departments said that judging from the situation last year, the quality of some important products is still unstable, and some have even declined. For example, the average ash content of coal produced by the Ministry of Coal Industry last year reached 21.85%, an increase of 1.19% compared with 1956, which means that 1.19 tons of stone are carried along with every 100 tons of coal produced. The loss due to defective products in the former First Ministry of Machine Building from the first quarter to the third quarter of last year was 14 million yuan. In the machinery manufacturing sector, the qualified rate of castings in some enterprises is currently only about 50%, which means that for every two castings produced, one is a substandard or defective product. Some comrades specifically mentioned that the quality of injections in the pharmaceutical sector has not been well improved, and the defective product rate is generally between 20% and 30%.

**Eliminate Waste in Raw Material Supply, Transportation, and Storage**

Comrades from relevant departments also pointed out the waste in raw material supply, transportation, and storage. Because this phenomenon has not been eliminated, it often creates a tense situation in which state funds are accumulated and the supply of certain materials cannot meet demand. Comrades from relevant departments said that there is currently a lot of potential to be tapped in this area, such as the slow turnover of working capital in some industrial sectors. The turnover period of fixed-quota funds of the former First Ministry of Machine Building in 1956 was 194 days, while the average for the first to third quarters of 1957 was 241 days, 47 days longer than in 1956. The inventory of scrap steel in the Second Machine Administration of this ministry was 287% of the plan, making the reserve funds exceed the plan by 47.5%. Some enterprises of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry have accumulated materials that can be used for two or three years of production. At present, the working capital occupied nationwide is about 40 billion yuan. If the turnover period is shortened by one day, 130 million yuan of funds can be freed up; the working capital used in the industrial sector is more than 7 billion yuan. If the turnover period is shortened by one day, 23 million yuan of funds can be freed up. In fact, the turnover period can be greatly shortened.

**Improve Labor Organization and Increase Labor Productivity**

Many enterprises have not paid enough attention to improving labor organization and increasing labor productivity, which has also affected cost reduction. Employee wages account for about 15% of the total cost of industrial products in China, so it is important to pay attention to tapping the potential in this area. Comrades from relevant departments said that in the first four years of the first five-year plan, the labor productivity of industrial workers in China increased year by year. However, last year, the labor productivity of seven industrial sectors decreased compared with 1956. Before the rectification movement, industrial production workers accounted for about 63% of the total number of employees nationwide, and staff accounted for 12% of the total number of employees. In the Soviet Union, according to statistics in 1956, production workers accounted for 82% of the total number of employees, and staff accounted for 4%. Obviously, the proportion of some non-direct production personnel in Chinese enterprises is too large. Comrades from relevant departments also repeatedly emphasized that the excessive number of employees in some Chinese enterprises is a great waste. In the past, the leaders of some enterprises did not care about increasing employees. After the number of employees increased, it could not be reduced, so the number of employees in these enterprises became larger and larger. After the launch of the rectification movement, many enterprises have played a major role in improving enterprise management and improving leadership style by streamlining institutions and decentralizing personnel. However, it should be known that the expenditure on employee wages in enterprises has not decreased. Therefore, what needs special attention now is to prevent the tendency of decentralizing personnel on the one hand and increasing employees on the other.

Comrades from relevant departments said that the irrational labor organization, lax labor discipline, and low attendance rate in some industrial sectors have caused great losses to the country. For example, enterprises under the Ministry of Forestry Industry had a total of 1,894,000 lost workdays in the first half of last year. According to the average number of working days in the first half of the year, this is equivalent to more than 18,200 people not producing for half a year. From January to November last year, only thirteen of the twenty-seven mining bureaus under the Ministry of Coal Industry achieved or exceeded the state-specified targets for production efficiency. Because most mining bureaus did not meet the targets, it was equivalent to a shortfall of more than 3.8 million tons of raw coal. It should be pointed out that in the coal mining industry and the forest harvesting industry, because there are no raw materials and the objects of labor are products of nature, the proportion of their wages accounts for about two-thirds of the total product cost. If these departments can improve labor productivity every year, the cost can still be greatly reduced.

**Reduce Enterprise Management Costs and Improve Equipment Utilization**

Enterprise management expenses account for about 15% of the cost of industrial products in China, which is also an important aspect of tapping the potential for reducing the cost of industrial products. Comrades from relevant departments said that there is still a lot of potential to be tapped in this area. For example, the utilization rate of equipment in some industrial sectors is still very low. The utilization rate of mechanical equipment in the Ministry of Forestry Industry is generally only about 50%, of which the utilization rate of vehicles for transporting timber is only 41.9%, and the utilization rate of Stalin 30 tractors is only 38.1%. The equipment utilization rate in the machinery industry sector is only about 60%. Due to the low equipment utilization rate, the output is not high, and the depreciation cost of the equipment must be fully allocated to the product cost in the same period, which increases the proportion of depreciation cost in the cost.

The excessive proportion of enterprise expenses in the cost of industrial products is closely related to the chaotic expenditure situation of some enterprises. After comrades from relevant departments exposed the phenomena of some enterprises violating financial discipline, they pointed out that, to date, the management expenses of some enterprises still account for about 50% of the product cost. In many thermal power generation enterprises, the ratio of management expenses to unit cost varies by about five times.

**The Key to Reducing Costs Lies in the Leadership's Attention and Determination**

Comrades from relevant departments said that there is still a lot of potential to be tapped in reducing the cost of industrial products. There are many reasons why these huge potentials have not been further tapped in the past. But no matter what, the key issue lies in the attention and determination of enterprise leaders in this regard. Now, the national rectification work is being further deepened, and the anti-waste and anti-conservatism struggle will be further unfolded. Many facts that have been revealed in the struggle are enough to make the leaders of many enterprises more deeply aware of the necessity and possibility of continuously reducing the cost of industrial products. In the past, some enterprise managers believed that some enterprises had been operating for a long time, their annual output was relatively stable, and they had a certain technical foundation. Therefore, they said that the cost reduction of these enterprises had reached its limit. However, after the launch of the anti-waste struggle, many facts refuted this right-leaning conservative ideology. Many factories and mines that have seen new production upsurges on the basis of deepened rectification include those that they previously believed had reached the limit of cost reduction. In these factories and mines, technology is constantly innovated, labor organization is constantly improved, output is greatly increased, and product costs are greatly reduced. In the past, some people also believed that if product quality is to be improved, raw materials should not be emphasized. Now, many facts have also refuted this wrong view. Their view is wrong because they did not realize the consistency between improving product quality and reducing costs; they did not realize that saving raw materials is not to reduce the required amount of raw materials, but to reduce the waste of raw materials in transportation, storage, and production processes; they did not realize that guaranteeing product quality generally does not rely on increasing the consumption quota of raw materials, but mainly relies on the adoption of effective advanced experience. In the past, the leaders of some enterprises believed that cost reduction was a simple calculation work and was the business of financial staff, while they themselves only managed production and capital construction projects; in particular, in the past, they only paid attention to unified accounting, but did not pay enough attention to mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of employees to do a good job in cost reduction according to local conditions. Now, the industrial management system has changed; the many facts revealed in this anti-waste and anti-conservatism struggle also fully illustrate that the previous approach must be changed in a timely manner.

Comrades from relevant departments believe that doing a good job in reducing the cost of industrial products is an arduous task and must be carried out jointly by mobilizing the broad masses of employees. Now a new upsurge in industrial production on a national scale is taking shape. The leaders of various enterprises should promptly hand over the tasks in this area to the masses for discussion. At the same time, based on the experience and lessons learned in this anti-waste and anti-conservatism struggle and the correct opinions of the masses, establish and improve various necessary systems in a timely manner, especially technical management, raw material management, and quota management, and vigorously promote advanced experience.

Comrades from relevant departments said that in addition to paying attention to the above-mentioned issues, the current leaders of enterprises should strive for excellence and work hard to increase production. Because only when production increases will there naturally be financial resources. According to calculations, if the total industrial output value nationwide increases by 1%, product costs can generally be reduced by about 40 million yuan. Moreover, when production increases, the fixed costs such as employee wages and depreciation expenses in the enterprise generally do not increase. Increasing production is one of the most active and easiest ways to promote anti-waste.

    反浪费反保守运动提供了丰富事实
    降低工业品成本大有可为
    只要减少生产费1％，一年就可节省二亿多元
    请看一看，比一比：在节约原材料、利用副产品、降低废品率、缩短流动资金周转期、提高劳动生产率、减少管理费用等方面，潜力有多少？意义有多大？
    新华社25日讯　新华社记者骆风报道：进一步挖掘降低工业产品成本的潜在能力，是当前各厂矿企业贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业方针的一个极重要的环节；也是力争上游，提高企业经营管理水平，增加社会主义积累的重要办法。
    降低成本是管理水平提高的总标志
    这是有关部门在研究了最近反浪费斗争的情况以后得出来的看法。有关部门的同志在强调说明了几年来我国增产节约运动的巨大成绩后指出，现在的工业生产规模空前扩大了，全国纳入国家计划的国营和公私合营的工业企业已有六万多个，去年的全部工业产值（不包括手工业）达到五百六十多亿元。因此，进一步加强现有企业的经营管理工作，已成为当前迫切重要的任务。企业中产品成本的降低，是管理水平提高的总标志，也是增加社会主义积累的重要源泉。目前仅全国国营和地方国营工业一年的生产费共有二百多亿元，如果节约1％，就是两亿多元。事实上，这方面的潜力很大，只要大力加以挖掘，就可以为国家积累大量的资金。
    节约原材料、燃料和动力的消耗
    降低工业产品成本的最大潜力，是在原材料、燃料和动力的消耗方面。据统计，在我国工业产品成本构成中，这方面的费用占总成本的70％左右。因此，有关部门的同志认为，节约这方面的费用，对降低工业产品成本有着决定性的意义。目前存在的主要问题是，生产同样产品的原材料消耗定额在不同厂矿和不同地区之间相差很大。例如：发一千度电所用的标准煤，全国有些厂只用四百公斤，可是有些厂却在一千公斤以上。生产一吨平炉钢所耗用的金属料，有的厂已达一千零九十三公斤，而最高的厂却在一千一百八十六公斤以上。鞍山钢铁公司炼一吨生铁所需的焦炭定额是七百一十一公斤，而龙烟铁矿却要一千零一十八公斤。石岘造纸厂每吨漂白木浆的耗用原木量只要五点五二二立方公尺，而开山屯造纸厂却要六点一六六立方公尺；营口造纸厂每吨漂白苇浆的耗用量是一千九百三十一公斤，而锦州造纸厂却要二千零五十二公斤。纺一件棉纱的用棉量，全国最低的是一百九十二点二公斤，最高的仍在一百九十六点三公斤左右。在机械制造过程中，金属切削量一般过大。如果以金属零件成品重量和使用毛坯重量比较，有的切余料竟达60％。现在，全国的工业产品已经有几万种，如果每种产品的原材料消耗定额都争取达到平均先进的水平，那末为国家节约的资金是非常可观的。
    用廉价原材料代替贵重原材料
    在工业生产中，以廉价原材料代替贵重原材料，特别是代替国家所缺乏的原材料有着重大的意义。但是，据有关部门的同志说，在过去几年中这项重要的经济措施还没有引起所有的厂矿企业重视。比如：在煤炭工业方面，早已提出的水泥棚子、金属支柱替代坑木和原木支柱的措施还没有普遍推广。有人认为，如果全国煤矿今年达到使用水泥棚子四十三万架，金属支柱十万根，就可以为国家节省二十一点六万立方公尺的坑木，节约资金四百五十二万元。在电力工业方面，以低质煤代替好煤发电的办法，也已提倡了几年，但是仍然推广得不够。全国电力工业如果都采用这个办法，并且把低质煤对好煤的比例处理得适当，共可以节约二百四十万吨好煤。在机械工业方面，以产量较大的金属来代替缺乏的有色金属的措施，也没有推广得很好。在这一部门的生产中，仅能够用铝或钢来代替铜的地方一律加以代替，为国家节省的资金就非常巨大。
    利用副产品和废料
    几年来对副产品和废料的利用还注意不够。有关部门的同志同样指出了许多事实：在有色金属的冶炼中，很多有色金属没有回收；如钨矿中的铜、铅、银和钴，钼矿中的钴和硫，铅矿中的银和镉等。对于这些贵重的金属，如果很好地组织回收工作（包括增加必要的设备），它们的经济意义是可想而知的。在炼焦工业中，可以回收国家急需的化学品有三百多种。去年我国生产的炼焦煤有八百万吨左右。每吨炼焦煤除能炼成七百多公斤焦炭外，还可提取煤焦油三十五公斤左右，焦炉气三百立方公尺。煤焦油是制造塑料、合成纤维和染料等的主要原料，焦炉气可以做合成氨、氯化烷类和乙醇等。但是，目前除鞍钢外，其他的钢铁厂和炼焦厂对于这些重要的副产品大多没有合理利用。
    降低废品率
    废品的损失，也是造成许多工业产品成本不能降低的重要原因之一。有关部门的同志说，从去年的情况看，有一些重要的产品质量还不稳定，有的甚至下降了。如煤炭工业部去年生产的煤，灰分平均达21.85％，比1956年增加1.19％，就是说每生产一百吨煤要多夹带一点一九吨石头。前第一机械工业部在去年第一季度到第三季度因废品的损失就有一千四百万元。在机械制造部门中，目前有些企业的铸件合格率只达50％左右，就是说每生产两个铸件，有一个次品或废品。有的同志特别提到医药部门的针剂质量一直没有很好改进，废品率一般都在20％到30％。
    消除原材料供应、运输、保管中的浪费现象
    有关部门的同志还指出原材料供应、运输和保管方面的浪费现象。由于这种现象没有消除，常常造成既积压了国家资金，又促使某些物资供不应求的紧张局面。有关部门同志说，目前在这方面可以挖掘的潜力很多，如某些工业部门的流动资金周转还很缓慢。前第一机械工业部1956年定额资金的周转期是一百九十四天，而1957年第一季到第三季度平均为二百四十一天，比1956年延长了四十七天。这个部的第二机器管理局的废钢库存数为计划的287％，使储备资金比计划超过47.5％。电力工业部有些企业积压材料，可以供两三年生产之用。目前，全国占用的流动资金大约有四百多亿元，如果周转期缩短一天，就可以解放出一点三亿元的资金；用于工业方面的流动资金有七十多亿元，如果周转期缩短一天，就可以解放出二千三百多万元的资金。事实上，周转期是可以大大缩短的。
    改善劳动组织提高劳动生产率
    许多企业对于改善劳动组织，提高劳动生产率不够注意，也影响了成本的降低。在我国工业产品总成本中职工工资大约占15％，因此经常注意挖掘这方面的潜力也不可忽视。有关部门的同志说，第一个五年计划的前四年，我国工业工人的劳动生产率都是逐年提高的。但在去年却有七个工业部门的劳动生产率比1956年下降了。在整风运动以前，全国工业生产工人为职工总数的63％左右，职员为职工总数的12％。而苏联，据1956年统计，生产工人为职工总数的82％，职员为4％。显然，我国企业中某些非直接生产人员的比例太大了。有关部门的同志并且反复强调地指出，我国一些企业的职工人数过多，是一种很大的浪费。过去一些企业的领导人对于增加职工满不在乎，职工增加以后就减不下来，所以这些企业的职工人数越来越大。整风运动开展以后，许多企业由于紧缩了机构，下放了人员，这对于改善企业管理和改进领导作风等方面起了重大的作用。但是应该知道，企业中的职工工资的开支却并没有减少。因此，现在需要特别注意防止的是，一面下放人员，一面又增加职工的那种偏向的发生。
    有关部门的同志说，某些工业部门的劳动组织不合理，劳动纪律松弛，出勤率不高，给国家造成的损失是很大的。如森林工业部所属企业去年上半年共缺勤一百八十九万四千多个工日，按照这个部上半年平均作业天数计算，等于一万八千二百多人半年没有生产。煤炭工业部去年1月到11月，全国二十七个矿务局中仅有十三个局的生产工效率达到或超过国家规定的指标。由于多数矿务局没有达到指标，相当于少生产三百八十多万吨原煤。应当指出，在煤矿工业和森林采伐工业中，由于没有原料，劳动对象是自然界的产物，它们的工资比重占全部产品成本的三分之二左右。如果这些部门每年都能提高劳动生产率，那末成本还是可以大大降低的。
    降低企业管理费用提高设备利用率
    在我国的工业产品成本中，企业管理费的支出占15％左右，这也是挖掘降低工业产品成本的一个重要方面。有关部门同志说，目前在这方面也有很多潜力可以挖掘，如某些工业部门的设备利用率仍然很低。森林工业部的机械设备利用率一般仅达50％左右，其中运材用汽车的利用率仅41.9％，斯大林30号拖拉机的利用率仅38.1％。机械工业部门的设备利用率也只达60％左右。由于设备利用率低，产量也就不高，而设备的折旧费却要全部分摊到同期的产品成本中去，这样就增加了成本中折旧费的比重。
    工业产品成本中企业费用比例过大，是同某些企业的费用开支情况混乱有密切关系的。有关部门的同志在揭发了一些企业的违反财政纪律的现象以后指出，到现在为止，还有一些企业的管理费占产品成本的50％左右。在许多火力发电企业中，管理费在单位成本中的比例，高低相差五倍左右。
    降低成本的关键在于领导的重视和决心
    有关部门的同志说，在降低工业产品成本方面可以挖掘的潜力还有很多。这些巨大的潜力，在过去所以没有得到进一步的挖掘是有许多原因的。但是不管怎样，关键性的问题，在于企业领导人员对这方面的重视和决心。现在，全国的整改工作正在进一步深入，反浪费反保守的斗争将要进一步展开。在斗争中已经揭发出来的许多事实，足以使许多企业的领导人员更加深刻地认识到不断降低工业产品成本的必要性和可能性。过去某些企业管理人员认为，有些企业由于经营时间较长，每年产量比较稳定，技术上也有了一定的基础，因此说这些企业的降低产品成本已经到了极限。但在这次反浪费斗争开展以后，许多事实批驳了这种右倾保守思想。许多在整改深入基础上出现新的生产高潮的厂矿，其中就有他们过去认为降低成本已到了极限的厂矿。在这些厂矿中，技术不断革新，劳动组织不断改进，产量大大提高，产品成本大大降低。过去还有些人认为如果要提高产品质量，就不能强调节约原材料。现在也已经有许多事实驳斥了这种错误的看法。他们的看法错误，在于没有认识到提高产品质量和降低成本的一致性；没有认识到节约原材料并不是减少应有的原材料用量，而是要减少原材料在运输、保管和生产过程中的浪费；没有认识到保证产品质量，一般地不是依靠提高原材料消耗定额，而主要是依靠采用有效的先进经验。过去某些企业的领导人认为降低成本是一种单纯的计算工作，是财务工作人员的事，而他们自己只管生产和基本建设等项目；特别是过去只注意了统一核算，而对因地制宜地调动职工群众的积极性和创造性来搞好降低成本的工作注意不够。现在，工业管理体制已经改变；这次反浪费反保守斗争中揭露出来的许多事实也充分说明了过去那种做法必须及时改变。
    有关部门的同志认为，搞好降低工业产品成本是一件艰巨的工作，必须放手发动广大职工群众来共同进行。现在全国规模的工业生产新高潮正在形成，各企业的领导人员应该及时把这方面的任务交到群众中去讨论。同时，根据这次反浪费反保守斗争中得到的经验教训和群众的正确意见，及时建立和健全各种必要的制度，特别是技术管理、原材料管理和定额管理等等的制度；并大力推广先进经验。
    有关部门的同志说，目前企业的领导人员除了注意上述的问题以外，应该力争上游，努力增加生产。因为只有生产增加了，财源自然也就有了。据计算，全国工业总产值增加1％，产品成本一般地就可以降低四千万元左右。而且生产增加时，企业中的人员工资和折旧费等固定费用一般是不会增加的。增加生产的办法，是反浪费中最积极的、也是最易推行的办法之一。
