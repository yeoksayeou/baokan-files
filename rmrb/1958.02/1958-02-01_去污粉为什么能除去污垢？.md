Why Can Cleansing Powder Remove Stains?

　　In the kitchen, scouring powder is often used to wash greasy pots, pans, and various enamel utensils. In the laboratory, it is used to wash dirty glass instruments and porcelain. In the lavatory, it is used to clean washbasins, bathtubs, and toilets. It is also often used when wiping window glass. Why is scouring powder so widely used?

　　The main components of scouring powder are soap, soda, water glass, and a small amount of sodium perborate. These ingredients are highly alkaline and soluble in water, so grease is easily washed away when it comes into contact with them. Scouring powder also contains a small amount of fine sand. Fine sand is insoluble in water, so when scouring powder is used to scrub washbasins, bathtubs, and glass, the fine sand creates friction with the surface of these objects, causing the dirt to quickly fall off the surface of the utensils.

　　However, it is not appropriate to use scouring powder to wash clothes. Precisely because of its strong alkalinity, although it easily removes grease and other dirt from clothes, the clothes are also eroded and become less durable. If you wash clothes with it several times, they will break. Similarly, it is not appropriate to use scouring powder to wash hands, because strong alkali can irritate the skin.

　　去污粉为什么能除去污垢？
    在厨房里常常用去污粉来洗涤油腻的锅子、盘子和各种搪瓷器皿上的污垢，实验室里用它来洗脏的玻璃仪器和瓷器，盥洗室里用它来清洗洗脸槽、浴盆和抽水马桶，擦窗玻璃时也常常要用到它。为什么去污粉的用途这样广？
    去污粉的主要成分是肥皂、苏打、水玻璃和少许过硼酸钠。这些成分都有很强的碱性，并且能溶解在水中，因此油腻碰到它，就很容易地被洗去。去污粉里还混入了少量细砂，细砂不溶于水，所以用去污粉来擦洗洗脸槽、浴盆和玻璃时，细砂就同这些东西的表面产生了摩擦作用，使污垢很快地从器皿的表面掉下来。
    但是用去污粉洗衣服是不适宜的。正由于它的碱性强，所以虽然容易把衣服上的油腻和其他脏东西洗掉，但是衣服也因此受到侵蚀而变得不经穿，如果多洗几次衣服就会破了。同样地，用去污粉来洗手也是不适宜的，因为强碱会刺激皮肤。　（林）
