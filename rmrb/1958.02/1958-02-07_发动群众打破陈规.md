Mobilize the Masses to Break with Conventions

    Today's publication in this newspaper of the news regarding the Beijing Railway Bureau's reform of three unreasonable systems illustrates two points: first, unreasonable rules and regulations need to be actively reformed; second, a good way to reform unreasonable rules and regulations is to boldly mobilize the masses, with everything subject to experimentation.

    Timely and reasonable rules and regulations can encourage the revolutionary consciousness and creative spirit of the masses, and facilitate and promote the development of production. Outdated and unreasonable rules and regulations, however, will hinder the improvement of the masses' consciousness and the development of production. In the past eight years, the rules and regulations formulated and implemented by various government departments and localities have played a positive role in promoting socialist transformation and socialist construction. However, some of them were originally correct, but have become inapplicable as circumstances have changed, especially after the basic completion of the three major transformations and the development of production; others were either left over from the old society and have not yet been revised, or were formulated by various departments and units without discussion and trial implementation by the masses and without contact with relevant departments and units, and therefore were inherently unreasonable. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his report on the rectification movement: "Many rules and regulations are unreasonable, impractical, and contradictory. This affects the relationship between superiors and subordinates, between equals, between departments, and between different groups of people, and affects the development of production." The Beijing Railway Bureau's original rules for major and medium repairs of locomotives were criticized by the masses as "forcing people with minor illnesses to be hospitalized for surgery." Their original vehicle inspection regulations and housing maintenance regulations required many intact vehicles and houses to undergo "annual repairs" "according to law." All of this restricted the development of transportation and wasted a large amount of state resources. The news reported by this newspaper on January 31 about the Qishuyan Power Plant's reduction of excessively high bonus rates is another example. Their original reward system not only wasted the state's valuable funds every month, but also artificially created contradictions between some employees and others, and even fueled the employees' economism, weakened their enthusiasm for production, and hindered improvements in production technology. Obviously, such rules and regulations must be reformed.

    Rules and regulations are part of the superstructure. The superstructure must meet the needs of the economic base. However, things are always developing in contradiction, and there are still inevitable contradictions between the socialist superstructure and the economic base. Therefore, we must pay close attention to timely adjusting various links in the superstructure to resolve certain contradictions with the economic base, so that the superstructure can effectively serve the economic base. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The state system and laws of the people's democratic dictatorship, and the socialist ideology guided by Marxism-Leninism, these superstructures have played a positive role in promoting the victory of socialist transformation in our country and the establishment of socialist labor organization. It is in line with the socialist economic base, that is, the socialist relations of production; however, the existence of bourgeois ideology, the existence of certain bureaucratic styles in state organs, and the existence of defects in certain aspects of the state system are in contradiction with the socialist economic base. In the future, we must continue to resolve the above-mentioned contradictions according to the specific situation." At present, a new situation of a high tide of socialist construction has emerged throughout the country. The productive forces liberated by the socialist revolution and the production enthusiasm of the masses inspired by the rectification movement are advancing valiantly with the force of thousands of troops. Many tasks have broken the old "conventions", and their development has changed from gradual to leaps and bounds. This makes it even more urgent to reform those rules and regulations that are incompatible with the socialist economic base, restrict the development of productive forces, and bind the enthusiasm of the masses.

    All leaders who are willing to promote the development of productive forces and do not want to lag behind the new situation should clearly recognize the importance of this issue. Their responsibility is not only to allow the masses to break with conventions, but also to mobilize the masses, encourage the masses, and work with the masses to break with conventions. However, there are still some leaders who, although they do not deny that unreasonable rules and regulations should be reformed, are afraid of this and that when they take action, fearing that some backward people will be dissatisfied, and that it will "affect other units" or "disrupt work steps." Some people even think that after the masses have risen up and broken with conventions, they should "take it slowly, and wait until we have studied it in the future and change it together", and "don't change it if you can avoid it." For these people, major reforms have never been considered, and even many problems that are in front of them, that must be solved and can be solved in their own departments and units, they are unwilling to solve immediately. This attitude is obviously wrong.

    The principle to be followed in reforming unreasonable rules and regulations is to develop socialist construction in a faster, better, and more economical way and to increase the enthusiasm of the masses. The Beijing Railway Bureau, the Qishuyan Power Plant, as well as the Xiangjiang Machine Factory, which actively reformed the housing system, and the Shijingshan Power Plant, which reduced excessively high welfare benefits, were unwilling to be restricted by the original rules and regulations, and broke unreasonable conventions after boldly mobilizing the masses. This did not make things worse, but only made things better. Higher-level leading organs should also not "follow the rules" and handle affairs according to the old rules, but should, on the premise of developing the socialist cause in a faster, better, and more economical way and improving the consciousness of the masses, approve the pioneering efforts of some units to break unreasonable rules and regulations, and seriously go to the masses to summarize their experience, so as to experiment and promote it in more units. Not only that, the central departments and the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees should also send responsible comrades to the local and grassroots units to actively check the current rules and regulations, organize the masses to speak out and debate, preserve the reasonable parts of them, modify or abolish the unreasonable parts, and, when necessary, draft some preliminary drafts of new rules and regulations for trial implementation in several units, and then, after gaining mature experience, determine these new rules and regulations legally according to the different situations and according to certain procedures. This is the correct attitude to actively adapt to the current new situation.

    "Boldly mobilize the masses, and everything goes through experimentation" is the mass line working method that should be adopted in formulating and revising various rules and regulations.

### 发动群众打破陈规

　　发动群众打破陈规
    本报今天发表的北京铁路管理局改革三项不合理的制度的新闻，说明了两个问题：一是不合理的规章制度需要积极改革；一是改革不合理规章制度的好办法，就是放手发动群众，一切经过试验。
    适时的、合理的规章制度，可以使群众的革命觉悟和创造精神得到鼓励，便利和促进生产的发展。过时的不合理的规章制度，却会阻碍群众觉悟的提高和生产的发展。八年来，政府各部门和各地方制定和实施的规章制度，大部分对于社会主义改造和社会主义建设起了积极促进的作用。但是，其中也有一部分原来是正确的，但在情况发生变化、特别是在三大改造基本完成和生产发展以后，已经不适用了；也有一部分或者是旧社会遗留下来还没有加以改订的，或者是在各个部门各个单位在没有经过群众讨论和试行而且同有关部门单位互不联系的情况下制定的，因而本来就不够合理。正如邓小平同志在关于整风运动的报告中指出的：“许多规章制度不合理，不切实际，相互矛盾。这影响到上下级之间、同级之间、这一部门和那一部门之间、这部分群众和那部分群众之间的关系，影响到生产的发展。”北京铁路管理局原来实行的机车大、中修规则，被群众批评为“强迫患小病的人住院开刀”。他们原来实行的车辆检修规定、房屋维修规定，使许多完好的车辆、房屋要“依法”进行“年修”。这都限制了交通运输事业的发展，浪费了国家大量资财。本报1月31日报道的戚墅堰发电厂降低过高的奖金率的新闻，也是一个例子。他们原来的奖励制度既月月浪费着国家宝贵的资金，又人为地制造着这部分职工同那部分职工之间的矛盾，甚至还助长了职工的经济主义的思想，削弱了职工的生产积极性，妨碍了生产技术上的改进。显然，这类规章制度，已是非改革不可了。
    规章制度是上层建筑的一部分。上层建筑必须适合经济基础的需要。但是，事物永远是在矛盾中发展的，社会主义的上层建筑和经济基础之间也仍然不可避免地发生这样或那样的矛盾。因此，我们必须十分注意及时地调整上层建筑各个环节同经济基础的某些矛盾，使上层建筑有效地为经济基础服务。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这一讲演中教导我们：“人民民主专政的国家制度和法律，以马克思列宁主义为指导的社会主义意识形态，这些上层建筑对于我国社会主义改造的胜利和社会主义劳动组织的建立起了积极的推动作用，它是和社会主义的经济基础即社会主义的生产关系相适应的；但是，资产阶级意识形态的存在，国家机构中某些官僚主义作风的存在，国家制度中某些环节上缺陷的存在，又是和社会主义的经济基础相矛盾的。我们今后必须按照具体的情况，继续解决上述的各种矛盾。”目前，在全国范围内出现了一个社会主义建设高潮的新形势。为社会主义革命所解放出来的生产力和为整风运动所激发的群众的生产热情，正以千军万马之势，勇猛前进。许多工作都打破了旧日的“常规”，它们的发展由渐进变为跃进。这就更加迫切要求及时改革那些同社会主义的经济基础不相适应、限制生产力发展、束缚群众积极性的规章制度。
    一切愿意促进生产力发展而不愿使自己落在新形势后面的领导人，都应该明确地认识这个问题的重要意义。他们的责任不但是准许群众打破陈规，而且是发动群众、鼓励群众、同群众在一起来打破陈规。但是，目前也还有这样的领导人员，他们虽不否认不合理的规章制度应该改革，但是行动起来前怕龙后怕虎，既怕某些落后群众不满意，又怕“影响其他单位”、“打乱工作步骤”。甚至群众起来已经打破陈规了，有些人还认为应该“慢慢来，等将来研究好了一块改”，“能不改的就先别改”。对于这些人来说，大的改革固然是从未想过，就是许多摆在眼前的问题，在本部门本单位必须解决也可以解决的问题，也不愿立即加以解决。这种态度显然是错误的。
    改革不合理的规章制度所需要遵循的原则，是有利于多快好省地发展社会主义建设和提高群众的积极性。北京铁路管理局、戚墅堰发电厂以及积极改革住房制度的湘江机器厂、降低过高的福利待遇的石景山发电厂，都是不愿原有规章制度的限制，经过放手发动群众，打破了不合理的陈规。这样作并没有把事情弄坏，只是把事情办得更好了。上级领导机关也不能“按部就班”，照老规矩办事，而是应该在有利于多快好省地发展社会主义事业和提高群众觉悟的前提下，对部分单位打破不合理规章制度的创举，加以批准，并且认真地到群众中间去总结他们的经验，以便在更多的单位中试验推行。不仅如此，中央各部门和省、市、自治区党委，还应该派负责同志到地方和基层单位去主动地检查现行的规章制度，组织群众鸣放和辩论，保存它们中间的合理部分，修改或者废除其中的不合理部分，并且在必要的时候拟定一些新的规章制度的初步草案来在若干单位试行，等待取得成熟的经验以后，再分别不同情况，按照一定的程序，对这些新的规章制度加以法律上的确定。这才是积极适应当前新形势的正确态度。
    “放手发动群众，一切经过试验”，这是制定和修改各种规章制度所应当采取的群众路线的工作方法。
