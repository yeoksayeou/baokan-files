Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

The CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee issued a "Decision on Leaders at All Levels Directly Participating in Labor Production and Learning Production Technology" on the 12th.

The decision stated: Currently, some factory and enterprise leaders are adopting the method of taking time out each week to go deep into the workshops to participate in labor and learn production technology from workers. This approach is very effective for leaders to acquire practical production knowledge, strengthen the connection between leaders and the masses, and strengthen the leadership of production in a deep and concrete way. The Municipal Committee believes that it is necessary to promote this experience.

The decision of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee stipulates that all Party Committee (General Branch) secretaries, deputy secretaries, factory directors, deputy factory directors, trade union chairmen, and Communist Youth League secretaries in factories and enterprises who are detached from production should spend half a day each week participating in production and learning production technology in the workshops, and also spend a certain amount of time learning scientific knowledge related to technology. They should strive to acquire the necessary scientific knowledge and operational experience of the various major types of work in their factories within a certain period of time. Secretaries of the Municipal and District Committees in charge of industry, chairmen and vice-chairmen of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, industrial ministers of the Municipal and District Committees, responsible comrades of various industrial bureaus and specialized companies, as well as responsible comrades of other departments in charge of industry, should also go deep into a grassroots unit, participate in actual labor production, and familiarize themselves with the actual knowledge of one to several production technologies related to their own work, so as to discover problems in a timely manner and provide practical and effective leadership.

The decision stated that comrades at the municipal and district levels who lead industry and leading comrades in factories and enterprises should also grasp an advanced production unit and focus on the trial use of new technologies and the trial manufacture of new products, in order to obtain practical and advanced work experience, more effectively improve the specific leadership of enterprises, and promote technological improvements.

    中共上海市委要求各级领导干部
    参加劳动生产　学习生产技术
    据新华社讯　中共上海市委员会12日发布了一个“关于各级领导干部直接参加劳动生产、学习生产技术的决定”。
    决定中说：目前有一部分工厂企业的领导干部，采取每星期抽出一定时间深入车间参加劳动的办法，向工人学习生产技术。这种做法，对于领导干部取得实际生产知识，密切领导与群众的联系，深入地、具体地加强对生产的领导，效果十分显著。市委认为有必要推广这种经验。
    中共上海市委的决定规定：所有工厂企业中脱离生产的党委（总支）书记、副书记、厂长、副厂长、工会主席、团委书记，每星期都应该有一个半天的时间到车间里去参加生产，学习生产技术，并且抽出一定时间，学习有关技术方面的科学知识。求得在一定时间内对本厂各个主要工种的技术，都具备必要的科学知识和操作经验。市委、区委分管工业的书记，市工联主席、副主席，市委、区委的工业部长，各工业局和专业公司的负责同志，以及其他部门管工业的负责同志，同样应该深入一个基层单位，参加实际劳动生产，熟悉同自己业务有关的一项到几项生产技术的实际知识，以便及时发现问题，进行切实有效的领导。
    决定说，市、区两级机关领导工业的同志和工厂企业中的领导同志，还应该抓一个先进生产单位，抓试用新技术、试制新产品，以便取得实际的先进的工作经验，更有效地改进对企业的具体领导，并且推动技术方面的改进。
