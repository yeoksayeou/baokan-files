Tea Production to Rapidly Surpass Historical Highs
Tea Work Conference Exchanges Tea Planting Experiences, Studies Great Leap Forward in Tea Production

(Our Newspaper) The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently convened a tea work conference to vigorously support tea production. In addition to representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and the supply and marketing cooperative systems of tea-producing provinces, heads of county Party committees, county people's committees, county agricultural bureaus from key tea-producing counties, as well as responsible individuals from state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives mainly engaged in tea production, were invited to attend. The main content of the meeting was to exchange experiences in tea production, primary processing, and procurement, especially the organizational leadership of local Party committees and governments in tea production and specific experiences in increasing production and achieving bumper harvests. Representatives from thirteen key tea-producing counties shared their experiences. The common experiences of counties such as Qimen, Anxi, Chun'an, Lianyuan, Wuyuan, and Wufeng were: as long as the Party committee strengthens leadership, assigns dedicated personnel, mobilizes the masses, makes overall plans, unifies arrangements, and organizes forces, both agricultural and tea production can achieve bumper harvests. Based solely on the materials brought to this meeting, there are seven counties and cities with twenty-four cooperatives achieving over 100 *jin* of dry tea per *mu*, with some cooperatives reaching as high as 310 *jin*. High-yield gardens have achieved yields of 458 *jin* per *mu*. The experience of high-yield counties and cooperatives is: diligent cultivation and heavy fertilization. Three cultivations and one weeding (weeding), three or four applications of fertilizer, and frost and pest prevention are the main measures for increasing production and achieving bumper harvests. Three harvests (timely harvesting, multiple harvests in batches, and harvesting with fish leaves) and three separations (separating old and tender leaves, separating packaging, and separating processing) are reliable practices for improving and enhancing tea quality. Experience has also proven that procurement departments, in coordination with agricultural departments under the unified arrangement of the Party committee, play a significant role in helping agricultural cooperatives arrange tea production and providing technical guidance in production, harvesting, and primary processing.

During the meeting, Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered important instructions. He first pointed out that since liberation, tea production has increased year by year, the area of tea gardens has continuously expanded, and the First Five-Year Plan has been overfulfilled. This is due to the series of measures taken by the Party and the government to support it, and the achievements are not small. However, the current output has not yet returned to pre-war levels, which is unsatisfactory. The vast areas south of the Qinling Mountains and the Huai River in our country have a mild climate and abundant rainfall, making them suitable for large-scale tea cultivation. Many places can produce tea but are not doing so. The southern provinces have approximately 3.3 billion *mu* of mountainous land. If 1% of this land is used for tea cultivation, it would amount to more than 30 million *mu*. Tea is not only a beverage for the people of our country and a necessity for ethnic minorities but also an important export commodity. Increasing tea production is a long-term need. We are communists and should serve the people of the world who do not have tea.

Vice Chairman Zhu then pointed out that tea does not compete with grain or cotton for land, it can be harvested many times, it has a long growth period, and it yields high returns. Many farmers have experience in tea cultivation, so our country has full conditions for developing tea production. As long as labor is properly allocated, overall plans are made, and efforts are made to quickly surpass the highest historical production level, it is entirely achievable.

Vice Chairman Zhu also pointed out that the methods for developing tea production are, first, to increase the yield per unit area; second, to reclaim abandoned tea gardens; and third, to open up new tea gardens and expand the tea planting area. Regions with the conditions can do all three simultaneously.

Vice Chairman Zhu finally emphasized that the key to developing tea production lies in the leadership of the Party committee. Provincial, prefectural, and county Party committees must take responsibility and attach importance to this issue, treating it as a major task. Every agricultural cooperative that can grow tea should have a tea-growing task, combining it with afforestation and soil and water conservation to make plans for increasing tea production. This should not be done on a small scale but on a large scale, forming a high tide. Subtropical regions should not only grow tea but also coffee.

Vice Chairman Zhu's instructions further clarified the direction of the Great Leap Forward in tea production for the representatives attending the meeting, greatly encouraged them, and strengthened their revolutionary drive. The representatives unanimously believed that tea production has great potential and abundant experience. As long as the Party committee strengthens leadership, makes overall plans, unifies arrangements, boldly mobilizes the masses, unifies and organizes technical forces, and seizes the main links for increasing production and achieving bumper harvests, tea production will definitely achieve a Great Leap Forward.

    茶叶生产要迅速超过历史最高水平
    茶叶工作会议交流种茶经验研究茶叶生产大跃进
    本报讯　中华全国供销合作总社为了大力扶植茶叶生产，最近召开了茶叶工作会议。除农业部和产茶省供销合作系统代表出席外，还邀请了部分重点产茶县的中共县委、县人民委员会、县农业局及部分产茶为主的国营农场和农业社负责人参加，会议主要内容是交流茶叶生产初制、采购工作的经验，特别是地方党政对茶叶生产的组织领导及增产丰产的具体经验。十三个重点产茶县代表介绍了经验。祁门、安溪、淳安、涟源、婺源、五峰等县的共同经验是：只要党委加强领导，专人负责、发动群众，全面规划，统一安排，组织力量，农业、茶叶生产都能够丰收。仅就这次会议带来的材料统计，每亩单产干茶一百市斤以上的有七个县、市二十四个社，有的社高达三百一十斤，丰产园有亩产四百五十八斤的。高产县、高产社的经验是：勤耕作、多施肥。三耕一锄（锄草），三、四次施肥，防冻防虫，是增产丰产的主要措施。三采（及时采、分批多次采、留鱼叶采），三分（老嫩分采、分装、分制）是改进提高茶叶品质的可靠做法。经验也证明：采购部门协同农业部门在党委统一安排下，帮助农业社安排茶叶生产，进行生产、采摘、初制的技术指导具有很大的作用。
    会议期间，朱德副主席曾到会作了重要指示。他首先指出，解放后几年来茶叶年年增产，茶园面积不断扩大，超额完成了第一个五年计划，这是由于党和政府采取一系列措施扶植起来的，成绩不小。但是现在产量还没有恢复到战前水平，这是不能令人满意的。我国秦岭、淮河以南的广大地区，气候温和、雨量充足，可以大量种茶。现在很多地方能产茶，而没有生产，南方各省约有山地三十三亿亩，如果以其中1％种茶，就有三千多万亩。茶叶不仅是国内人民的饮料，兄弟民族生活必需品，而且是重要出口物资。增加茶叶生产是长期需要的，我们是共产主义者，应该为全世界没有茶叶的人民服务。
    朱副主席接着指出，茶叶不与粮、棉争地，采摘次数多，生长年限长，收益大，许多农民有种茶经验，所以我国发展茶叶生产的条件是充分具备的，只要劳动力调配得好，全面规划，争取迅速超过历史上最高生产水平，是完全能够做到的。
    朱副主席还指出，发展茶叶生产的办法，首先是提高单位面积产量；其次是垦复荒芜茶园；第三是开辟新茶园，扩大茶树种植面积。有条件的地区可以同时并举。
    朱副主席最后着重指出，发展茶叶生产关键在于党委的领导。省委、地委、县委要负责任，要重视这个问题，把它当作一件大事去做。每一个可以种茶的农业社，要有种茶任务，结合绿化，水土保持，作好增加茶叶生产的规划，不是小搞，而要大搞，要形成高潮。亚热带地区不但要种茶，还要种咖啡。
    朱副主席的指示，使到会代表，进一步明确了茶叶生产大跃进的方向，受到极大的鼓舞，增强了革命干劲。代表们一致认为：茶叶生产潜力大、经验多，只要党委加强领导，全面规划，统一安排，放手发动群众，统一组织技术力量，抓住增产丰产的主要环节，茶叶生产肯定能够大跃进。
