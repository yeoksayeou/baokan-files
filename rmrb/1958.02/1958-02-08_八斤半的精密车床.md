Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th - A small lathe weighing only eight-and-a-half jin, designed for processing watch parts, has been successfully trial-produced at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant.

This watch lathe differs from ordinary small lathes on the market. All of its one hundred-plus parts require fine processing and heat treatment, similar to that used in manufacturing precision grinding machines. After processing, many parts undergo nitriding and quenching, followed by precision grinding, resulting in a surface as smooth as a mirror.

It is only 2.6 decimeters long and looks like a small toy for a three-year-old child when placed on a table. Its rotational speed is 36,000 revolutions per minute. This high speed enables cutting and drilling on watch mainsprings and bearings that are as thin as needles, with a precision many times higher than that of ordinary large lathes.

The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, which specializes in manufacturing precision grinding machines, will also trial-produce two more complex hexagonal small lathes and universal small lathes in the first half of this year.

　　八斤半的精密车床
    新华社上海7日电　一种加工手表零件的八斤半重的小车床，已在上海机床厂试制成功。
    这种钟表小车床不同于市上普通的小车床，它的全部一百多个零件，都是跟制造精密磨床一样地需要精细加工和热处理。不少零件在加工以后，还经过氮化淬火处理和精研磨，零件的表面光滑得像镜子一样。
    它只有二点六公寸长，放在桌上像一个三岁孩童玩的小玩具。它每分钟的转速是三万六千转。这样高的转速，就能够在针一般细的手表主轴和轴承上切削和钻孔，精度比普通大车床要高出许多倍。
    专业制造精密磨床的上海机床厂，今年上半年还将试制两种更复杂的六角小车床和通用小车床。
