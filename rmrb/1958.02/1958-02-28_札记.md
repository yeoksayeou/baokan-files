    Notes
    Facts Speak Louder Than Sophistry
    While the heads of the American government are boasting about how American foreign "aid" is conducive to "common security" and "world peace," two unpleasant things happened in Washington on the 25th.
    One was that a leaked secret report confirmed that a large amount of military supplies from American "aid" were being used to suppress the Algerian national liberation movement. The other was that, in full view of the public, the U.S. State Department had to admit that the barbaric bombing of peaceful Tunisian villages on February 8 by France was carried out with pirate-style fighter jets from American "aid".
    To explain the essence of "American aid," these ironclad facts are a hundred times more powerful than the nonsense of the Eisenhower, Dulles ilk.
    Who is the Illegal One?
    According to a revelation in the Japanese "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, Liu Lianren, a Chinese compatriot who was abducted by the Japanese army to Japan to engage in slave labor during Japan's invasion of China, escaped into the wilderness due to unbearable abuse and lived the life of a primitive man for thirteen years before being discovered recently. Such an event, of course, inevitably evokes our old hatred for the Japanese invaders. But what is even more infuriating is that the Japanese government authorities are said to not only have no apology for this, but instead want to treat our fellow countryman as an "illegal immigrant."
    Liu Lianren is indeed an "illegal immigrant," but he was "illegally" abducted by the Japanese invading government and subjected to "illegal" abuse. The Japanese government cannot shirk its guilt for violating international law.
    Sounds Good
    British Defense Minister Sandys said solemnly in the House of Commons on the 26th: "As Defense Minister, what I most fervently hope for is to see world disarmament." These are such nice-sounding words! But this Defense Minister immediately went on to say, "Unilateral disarmament by the West before an agreement is reached is most likely to endanger the prospects for world disarmament." And he stated that "we cannot relax our defense efforts."
    No one has asked Western countries (including Britain) to carry out unilateral disarmament. On the contrary, the Soviet Union has unilaterally reduced its troops more than once, while Britain and the United States have never responded. The people of all countries are asking the U.S. and Britain to honestly reach a disarmament agreement with the Soviet Union, but they are always evading the issue and are not relaxing their efforts to expand armaments in the slightest. Isn't it perfectly clear what Sandys and his ilk most fervently hope for?

    札记
    事实胜于狡辩
    美国政府首脑正大事吹嘘美国对外“援助”如何有利于“共同安全”和“世界和平”的时候，华盛顿在25日一天中发生了两件不太美妙的事情。
    一件是，一项被揭露的秘密报告证实，美国“援助”的大量军事物资正被用来镇压阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动。另一件是，在众目睽睽之下，美国国务院不得不承认，法国2月8日对突尼斯和平村庄的野蛮轰炸是用美国“援助”的海盗式战斗机进行的。
    要说明“美援”的实质，这些铁的事实比艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流的信口开河有力百倍。
    非法者谁
    据日本“赤旗报”揭露，一个在日本侵略中国期间被日本军队掳到日本从事奴隶劳动的我国同胞刘连仁由于不堪虐待逃亡荒野，过了十三年原始人的生活，直到最近才被发现。这样一件事，当然不免要勾起我们对日本侵略者的旧恨。但是更令人愤慨的是，据说日本政府当局不但对此毫无歉意，反而想要把我们的这位难胞作为“非法入境者”处理。
    刘连仁的确是一个“非法入境者”，他是被日本侵略政府“非法”掳去的，而且受到“非法”的虐待。日本政府是难辞违反国际法之咎的。
    说得好听
    英国国防大臣桑迪斯26日在下院煞有介事地说：“作为国防大臣，我最热烈希望的事莫过于见到世界裁军。”这是多好听的话呀！但是这位国防大臣马上又接着说，“西方在达成协议之前单方面裁军，是最能危害世界裁军的前景的。”而且他表示“不能放松我们的防御努力。”
    谁也没有要求西方国家（包括英国）进行单方面地裁军。相反的倒是苏联不止一次地单方面裁减了自己的军队，而英国和美国一回也没有响应过。各国人民都要求美英老老实实地和苏联一块达成裁军的协议，它们却老是顾左右而言他，而丝毫不放松扩军的努力。桑迪斯之流所最热烈希望的是什么，不是最明白不过的吗？
