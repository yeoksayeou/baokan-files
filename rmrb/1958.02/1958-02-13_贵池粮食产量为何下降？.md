Walking into the first hall of the Guichi County Agricultural Exhibition – the Grain Production Increase Hall – the first thing you see is a series of charts marking the yields of various agricultural products across the county over the past three years. Cotton, tea, silk, aquatic products, pigs, cattle, etc., are all increasing year by year, but the grain output, with 1955 as 100, rose to 116.7 in 1956, and then fell to 101.4 in 1957. This inevitably raises a question in every visitor's mind: what caused the county's grain output to decrease? Drought? No. Flood? Even less so. What exactly was it?

The guides patiently explained to each visitor:

"Our county has been promoting the 'Three Reforms' for three years now, and practice has proven that it is an effective way to increase production and ensure harvests. Among them, growing double-cropping rice is the main path to increased production. For example, in 1955, 10,000 mu of double-cropping rice was planted, with a double-cropping yield of more than 601 jin per mu, which was more than 155 jin per mu than the single-cropping middle rice of the same year, increasing the total rice production by 1,558,000 jin, accounting for 7.1% of the total annual grain output. In 1956, more than 218,000 mu of double-cropping rice was planted, with a double-cropping yield of more than 523 jin per mu, which was more than 103 jin per mu than the single-cropping middle rice of the same year, increasing the total rice production by more than 22,943,000 jin, accounting for 10.9% of the total annual grain output. However, due to the sudden expansion of the double-cropping rice planting area in 1956, a small portion of the land experienced yield reductions due to not adapting to local conditions, and some right-leaning conservative ideas raised their heads. Therefore, a certain degree of right-leaning thinking emerged in the production leadership in 1957, unilaterally emphasizing so-called 'adapting to local conditions,' so that the planting area only reached more than 117,000 mu. Although the double-cropping yield was higher than that of single-cropping middle rice, the total output was 12,900,000 jin less than in 1956. This is the main reason for the decrease in the total grain output in our county in 1957, and it is also a serious lesson in agricultural production. The masses' evaluation of double-cropping rice is pertinent. They said: 'The Three Reforms are good, the Three Reforms are good, the magic weapon for crops, can avoid disasters, can resist floods, since the implementation of the Three Reforms, more grain and more grass are harvested.' Some praised the planting of early rice, saying: 'Planting early rice is good everywhere, no drought, no flood, the insects are not yet born, the rice is harvested early.' However, those with right-leaning thoughts are people who are divorced from the masses, and they cannot hear the voices of the masses."

"What issues should we pay attention to when promoting double-cropping rice in our county?"

"Based on the experience of the past three years, we have realized that as long as we formulate production plans in a realistic manner, arrange stubble properly, and grasp the season, our county can promote it on a large scale. From the perspective of temperature, our county generally has a frost-free period of about 230 days. From the vernal equinox to the Qingming Festival, the general maximum temperature is 20°C, the minimum temperature is 1°C, and the average temperature is about 12°C. From the autumnal equinox to the Cold Dew Festival, the maximum temperature is 29°C, the minimum temperature is 15°C, and the average temperature is 24°C. From the perspective of rainfall, according to records of the past six years, the rainfall in May to July is more concentrated, the highest is 1628 mm, accounting for 70% of the annual rainfall; the lowest is 693 mm, accounting for 50% of the annual rainfall; the general is about 800 mm, accounting for about 53% of the annual rainfall. If we store these rainwater in time and use it rationally, we can meet the water requirements of double-cropping rice. Of course, good natural conditions alone are not enough, we must also pay attention to strengthening leadership."

"How to strengthen leadership!"

"According to past experience, we must grasp two things: (1) Rely on the masses to do a good job in investigation and research, so as to adapt to local conditions, and carry out land ranking according to water conservancy, climate, stubble, labor and other conditions to find out the bottom line. For example, the embankment area and the hilly area have a warm climate, sufficient water sources, and deep fields. This can greatly promote double-cropping rice; the conservative ideas of a few people must also be criticized to help them improve their understanding. (2) Actively create a material foundation. The amount of double-cropping rice planted and the quality of completion of the task depend on labor, fertilizer, and water conservancy. As long as we are good at relying on the masses, take out a vigorous spirit, and think of more ways, the conditions in these aspects can be completely improved and created. For example, Jiefang Cooperative in Taopo Township is an area with less labor and animal power, very bad soil quality, and insufficient water conservancy conditions; but they have improved more than 6,000 mu of soil over the years, and this year they have improved 2,335 mu of soil. The achievements in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation this winter are also unprecedented. This has laid a good material foundation for planting double-cropping rice. This shows that in the face of difficulties, as long as we mobilize the masses and move forward bravely, we will be able to extract more grain from nature."

"Can double-cropping rice be promoted in mountainous areas?"

"Some people say that mountainous areas are cold paddy fields, with low temperatures and little sunlight, and it is impossible to promote it at all. In fact, there are also some larger fan fields in mountainous areas with an open environment, and double-cropping rice can also be promoted. For example, the first production team of Xinyuan Cooperative in Zhan Da District planted 35 mu of double-cropping rice in the fan fields, with an average yield of 540 jin per mu (390 jin for early rice and 150 jin for late rice), which is 35% more than the 400 jin per mu of single-cropping middle rice on the same land. The main difficulty in the high ridges of hilly areas is water shortage. With the construction of ponds and weirs, these fields can also continuously expand the planting of double-cropping rice. The difficulty in the low lake fields in the embankment area is that they are often affected by waterlogging. After flood prevention and treatment, the waterlogging disaster has been eliminated or reduced, and planting double-cropping rice can be harvested steadily. Some that cannot be changed at present are not that double-cropping rice cannot be planted. Except for particularly large disasters, as long as the varieties are adjusted, production can still be increased. For example, Limin Cooperative in Wusha Township planted 60 mu of double-cropping early rice in the lower low embankment fields, with a double-cropping yield of 790 jin, which is more than 300 jin more than the 420 jin per mu of middle rice (Daye rice) planted by Shuanghui Cooperative in the low embankment fields. The seasonal problem of double-cropping is very important. According to the climatic law of our county, the embankment area and the hilly area are most suitable for sowing early rice 7-10 days before Qingming; the transplanting period, whether in mountainous areas, embankment areas, or hilly areas, is generally appropriate 7-10 days before the Beginning of Summer. Late rice should be sown before the Grain in Ear, and the transplanting period should be completed before the Beginning of Autumn. Looking at it this way, time is relatively tight. How to grasp it steadily and accurately? In addition to doing a good job in advance labor and animal power arrangement and fertilizer preparation, it is also necessary to properly solve the contradiction with the previous midsummer season, as well as the labor and animal power bearing capacity of early rice harvesting and late rice transplanting. The solution, in general, is to lengthen the distance between the stubble as much as possible within the appropriate season under the principle of ensuring increased production. The specific methods are to do a good job in midsummer arrangement (the previous crop of double-cropping rice is mainly green manure rape and March yellow barley), variety adjustment (such as Nantel, Daye rice can be rotated with Xiaohong rice, Zhezao 503, 60zao can be rotated with Zhumaocu, etc.), staged seedling raising and parasite seedling raising, etc."

"If you grasp the above problems when planting double-cropping rice, you can ensure a harvest. If you want to ensure a bumper harvest, you have to rely on improving technology. ..."

The guide patiently and in detail explained the double-cropping rice problem in Guichi County. After watching the exhibition, the audience not only learned a lot of agricultural technology, but also deeply realized how harmful right-leaning conservative ideas are. It is indeed a stumbling block on our road forward, and we must resolutely remove it!

    贵池粮食产量为何下降？
    倪为文　葛顺芳
    走进安徽贵池县农业展览会第一馆——粮食增产馆，首先看到的是一块块标志着全县三年来各种农产品产量的图表。棉花、茶叶、蚕丝、水产、猪、牛等等都在逐年增长，可是粮食产量以1955年为100，1956年上升为116.7，而1957年反而下降到101.4了。这不禁使每一个观众发生疑问：是什么原因使全县的粮食产量减少的呢？旱灾吗？不。水灾吗？更不。究竟是为什么？
    讲解员这样耐心地向每一个观众解释着：
    “我县推行‘三改’到现在已经三年了，从实践中证明它是一个增加生产、保证收成的行之有效的增产办法。其中又以种双季稻为增产主要门路。如1955年推广双季稻一万亩，双季单产为六百零一斤多，比同年一季中稻单产每亩多产一百五十五斤多，共增产稻谷一百五十五万八千斤，占全年粮食总产量7.1％。1956年种植双季稻二十一万八千多亩，双季单产五百二十三斤多，比同年一季中稻单产每亩多产一百零三斤，共增产稻谷二千二百九十四万三千多斤，占全年粮食总产量10.9％。可是，由于在1956年双季稻推广面积突然扩大，小部分土地上发生了不因地制宜而减产的情况，一些右倾保守思想就抬起头来了。因此，在1957年的生产领导上产生了一定程度的右倾思想，片面强调所谓‘因地制宜’，以致种植面积仅达十一万七千多亩。双季单产虽然比一季中稻有所增加，但总产量却比1956年少收了一千二百九十万斤。这就是我县1957年粮食总产减少的主要原因，也是在农业生产上的一个严重教训。群众对双季稻的评语是中肯的，他们说：‘三改好，三改好，庄稼的好法宝，能避灾，能抗涝，自从实行三改后，多收粮食多收草。’有的赞扬种早稻说：‘种早稻，处处好，旱不到，涝不了，虫子没出世，稻子早收了。’可是有右倾思想的人正是脱离群众的人，他们听不到群众的声音。”
    “究竟在我县推广双季稻应该注意些什么问题呢？”
    “根据三年来的经验，我们体会到：只要实事求是地制定生产计划，做好茬口安排，掌握季节，我县是可以大量推广的。从气温上来看，我县无霜期一般有二百三十天左右，春分到清明一般最高温度为20℃，最低温度为1℃，平均温度在12℃左右。从秋分到寒露最高温度为29℃，最低温度为15℃，平均温度为24℃。从雨量上来看，据六年来的记载，5—7月份雨量较集中，最高的一千六百二十八公厘，占年雨量70％；最少的六百九十三公厘，占年雨量50％；一般的约有八百公厘，占年雨量53％上下。如及时把这些雨水蓄起来，合理使用，便能满足双季稻所需要的水分的要求。当然，光有好的自然条件还不行，还必须注意加强领导。
    “怎样加强领导呢！”
    “根据过去经验，必须抓紧两件事：（一）依靠群众做好调查研究，以便因地制宜，根据水利、气候、茬口、劳力等条件，进行土地排队，摸清底子。如圩区、丘陵区气候暖，水源足，田底子深，这就可以大量的推广双季稻；对少数人的保守思想，也必须加以批判，帮助他们提高认识。（二）积极地创造物质基础。双季稻种植的多少，完成任务的好坏，决定于劳动力和肥料、水利。只要善于依靠群众，拿出一股干劲，多想办法，这几个方面的条件完全可以改善和创造的。如桃坡乡解放社，是一个劳畜力较少、土质很坏、水利条件不够好的地区；但他们历年来改良土壤六千多亩，今年改良土壤二千三百三十五亩。今冬的兴修水利和积肥成绩，也是历年来所没有的。这就为种双季稻打下了很好的物质基础。这说明了在困难面前只要发动群众，勇敢前进，就一定能向大自然索取到更多的粮食。”
    “山区能不能推广双季稻呢？”
    “有人说山区是冷水田，气温低，阳光少，根本不能推广。其实，在山区也有些面积较大的畈田，环境开朗，同样是可以推广双季稻的。如占大区新源社第一生产队，在畈田内插双季稻三十五亩，平均单产五百四十斤（早稻三百九十斤，晚稻一百五十斤），比同等土地一季中稻每亩收四百斤，增产35％。丘陵区的高塝田，主要困难是缺水。兴修了塘堰，这些田也可以不断地扩大种植双季稻。圩区的低湖田，困难是常受涝灾。经过防涝治涝，已经消灭或减轻了涝灾，插双季稻稳可丰收。有些目前还不能改变的，也并不是不能插双季稻，除特大灾害外，只要调剂品种，仍能增产。如乌沙乡利民社在下低圩田插六十亩双季早稻，双季单产七百九十斤，比双惠社低圩田插二十亩中稻（大叶稻）每亩收四百二十斤多产三百多斤。双季连作的季节问题十分重要。根据我县的气候规律，圩区和丘陵区早稻在清明前7—10天最适宜播种；移栽期不论山区、圩区、丘陵区，一般都在立夏前7—10天为宜。晚稻宜在芒种前播完，移栽期应在立秋前完毕。这样看，时间是比较紧的。如何抓得又稳又准？除事先做好劳畜力安排和肥料等准备外，还要妥善解决与前作午季的矛盾，以及早稻收割、晚稻抢插的劳畜力负担能力。解决的办法，总的说来，就是在保证增产的原则下，在适宜的季节内，尽量把茬口的距离拉长。具体方法是做好午季安排（双季稻前作主要是绿肥油菜和三月黄大麦）、品种调剂（如南特号、大叶稻可与小红稻连作，浙早503，60早，可与猪毛簇等连作）、分期育秧和寄秧等。”
    “插双季稻抓住了以上问题，就能保收。要想保证丰收，这就要靠提高技术了。……”
    讲解员耐心而又详尽地解释着贵池县的双季稻问题。看了展览会后，观众不但学习了许多农业技术，也深刻地体会到，右倾保守思想是多么害人。它的确是我们前进道路上的绊脚石，非坚决把它搬掉不可！
