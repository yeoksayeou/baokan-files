    Strengthen the Friendship Between Chinese and Soviet Scientists
    Academician of the Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Qiqin
    Two years ago, I had the honor of visiting the great People's Republic of China and visited many agricultural colleges, scientific research institutions, agricultural production cooperatives, and state-owned farms.
    The whole world knows that due to the cruel exploitation of colonialism, China's past agricultural production level was very low. However, after liberation, everything changed as quickly as in a fairy tale. One can see what kind of feats and miracles the people, freed from imperialist oppression and under the leadership of the Communist Party, can create!
    During our visit, our Chinese friends gave us warm hospitality and meticulous care, making it difficult for me to express my gratitude in words. We met many Chinese friends and established working relationships with them. For example, the Botanical Garden of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has good contact with the Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. We often exchange plant seeds. In 1957 alone, we sent 192 kinds of seed specimens to the Beijing Botanical Garden, and also received 211 kinds of specimens from the Beijing Botanical Garden. Sometimes we also exchange living plants. We also often communicate by letter to exchange work experience. For example, we learned that our Chinese friends were going to build a 6,000-square-meter greenhouse, so we sent the blueprints of our similarly sized greenhouse to our Chinese friends for reference.
    The connections between scientific workers and producers in China and the Soviet Union are developing and consolidating day by day. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance that we are celebrating now has created good conditions for the development and consolidation of these connections.

    加强中苏科学家的友谊
    苏联列宁农业科学院院士　齐津
    两年前，我很荣幸地访问了伟大的中华人民共和国，参观了很多农学院、科学研究机关、农业生产合作社和国营农场。
    全世界都知道，由于殖民主义的残酷剥削，中国过去的农业生产水平很低。但是，在解放后，一切都像神话中那样快的改变了。可以看到，摆脱了帝国主义压迫的、在共产党领导下的人民能够创立何等的功勋和奇迹啊！
    在访问期间，中国朋友们给我们以殷勤的接待和无微不至的关怀，使我很难用语言表达出我的感谢。我们结识了很多中国朋友，并且同他们建立了工作上的联系。例如，苏联科学院植物园同中国科学院植物园联系得很好。我们经常交换植物种子，在1957年一年内，我们送给了北京植物园一百九十二种种子标本，同时也得到了北京植物园送来的二百一十一种标本。有时候我们还交换活的植物。我们也经常通信交流工作经验。例如，我们知道中国朋友要建筑一间六千平方公尺大暖房，我们就把我们的同样大小的暖房的草图寄给中国朋友作参考。
    中苏两国科学工作者和生产者之间的联系在日益发展和巩固。我们现在所庆祝的中苏友好同盟互助条约为这些联系的发展和巩固创造了良好条件。
