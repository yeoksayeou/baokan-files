    Ulbricht Receives "Süddeutsche Zeitung" Reporter
    Explains Method for Establishing Confederation of Two Germanys
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 15th: The explanation given by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, regarding the German Democratic Republic's proposal to achieve the peaceful reunification of Germany through the establishment of a confederation of the two Germanys was published here on the 15th.
    Ulbricht made this explanation on the 13th when he received Hans Ulrich Kupski, the chief interviewer of the Munich-based West German newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung," and answered his questions.
    Ulbricht said: The reunification of the two Germanys into a democratic Germany must go through a process. All-German elections can only be held after West Germany has also created the prerequisites for truly free and democratic elections.
    Ulbricht elaborated on the specific method for achieving the peaceful reunification of Germany through a confederation, saying: First, the government of the German Democratic Republic and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany should conclude an international law treaty on the establishment of a confederation (or a union of states). Before mutual suspicion between the two sides is eliminated, a separate national authority above the two countries should not be established temporarily. Instead, a pan-German committee composed of representatives of the governments and parliaments of both parts of Germany could be formed, with advisory and recommendatory functions. This pan-German committee can reach agreements on measures to help the gradual rapprochement of the two Germanys and recommend that the two governments adopt them. The pan-German committee will pave the way for the establishment of an all-German government with the goodwill of both sides. Ulbricht estimated that within a year or two after the conclusion of the confederation treaty, there would be further prerequisites for moving towards unification.

    乌布利希接见“南德日报”记者
    阐明两个德国成立邦联办法
    据新华社柏林15日电　这里15日发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希就德意志民主共和国关于通过成立两个德国的邦联来实现德国的和平统一的建议所作的说明。
    乌布利希在13日接见西德慕尼黑的报纸“南德日报”采访主任汉·乌·凯普斯基和回答他的问题时，作了这个说明。
    乌布利希说：使两个德国重新统一成为一个民主的德国，必须经过一个过程。全德选举只有在西德也创造了举行真正自由民主的选举的前提以后才能举行。
    乌布利希阐述通过邦联实现德国和平统一的具体办法说：首先是由德意志民主共和国政府和联邦共和国政府缔结一项关于建立邦联（或国家联盟）的国际法性质的条约。在双方之间的相互猜疑未消除以前，暂不成立超越两个国家之上的单独的国家权力机构，而可以由德国两部分的政府和议会的代表组成一个具有谘询和建议职能的全德委员会。这个全德委员会可以就有助于两个德国逐步接近的措施达成协议，并建议两个政府采纳。全德委员会将在双方的善意之下铺平导致成立全德政府的道路。乌布利希估计，在缔结邦联条约以后的一年或两年内就会有进一步走向联合的前提。
