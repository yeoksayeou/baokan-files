Editor's note: This very profound and vivid report from the Lishui County Party Committee provides a typical experience of correctly handling contradictions among the people. Many township and commune cadres and farmers in Lishui County, due to serious individualism and departmentalism, generally concealed production yields, thereby burying production achievements and the experiences of high yields, failing to demonstrate the superiority of cooperativization, burdening cadres with heavy ideological baggage, and greatly suppressing the production enthusiasm of the masses. Initially, the County Party Committee wanted to use the suppressive method of "anti-concealment struggle" to ascertain the true yield, which resulted in very tense relations between cadres and the masses, greater ideological confusion among the masses, and more serious passive resistance. Later, the County Party Committee changed this discouraging method to an encouraging one, starting with the publicity of the "Forty Articles," launching a summary and evaluation, organizing a great leap forward in production, and combining it with the verification of yields, quickly untying the knots that had been impossible to untie for a long time, and greatly enhancing the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the masses. Not only was the grain yield of the previous year verified, ensuring the completion of the state grain purchase plan, but more importantly, it promoted a great leap forward in production. The original plan of the county was to achieve an average yield of 800 jin per mu in three years, but now it has been changed to achieving 800 jin per mu this year and striving to achieve 900 jin per mu. The experience of Lishui County shows that two different working methods will yield completely different results. At present, many places in the country still lack effective methods for verifying yields, solving the problem of unified purchase and sale of grain, and especially for positively carrying out socialist education to arouse the production enthusiasm of cadres and the masses and organizing a great leap forward in production. The experience of Lishui County is worth considering by various localities.

Lishui County launched a whole people's rectification movement, setting off a high tide of rectification and production, clarifying the ideological foundation of cadres and the masses, the foundation of past work, and the foundation of production, and verifying the grain yield of 1957, increasing it from the original estimated 463 jin per mu to 664 jin per mu. On this basis, the conservative plan was revised, changing from the original three-year plan to achieve "800 jin county" to ensuring the realization of "800 jin county" in 1958 and striving to achieve "900 jin county," thereby achieving two great leaps forward in ideology and production, and greatly promoting the current production and various tasks.

A Difficult Knot After the Harvest

Lishui County is located in southern Zhejiang, in the middle reaches of the Ou River, and is a mountainous county. Due to the abundance of mountains and hills, poor water conservancy conditions, and rough farming methods, the yield was not high in the past. In 1952, the yield of grain crops was only 429 jin per mu. Since liberation, thanks to the great efforts made by the Party and the government in leading farmers to develop production, advanced cooperativization was realized in the winter of 1955. In the year 1957, the County Party Committee accepted the experience and lessons of 1956, changed its leadership style, sent more than 100 cadres to strengthen the grassroots, rectified cooperatives several times, vigorously changed the cropping system, and coupled with favorable weather conditions without major natural disasters, as a result, every commune increased production and all crops had a bumper harvest. However, as soon as the autumn harvest began, we encountered a difficult knot. In the first half of the year, cadres and the masses all reflected: "The production season in 1957 was well-seized, the change of cropping system was appropriate to local conditions, cadres participating in production was good, the weather was favorable, and the rice seedlings grew well." But as soon as the harvest began, their tone changed. They said: "There was too much rain during the spring flowering, and the wheat grains were small. Continuous cropping of early rice for two consecutive years depleted the field's strength, and the rice didn't grow. Middle rice encountered a southern wind during flowering and suffered drought, resulting in many empty grains..." In short, the reported yield was not high, and in many places, it was even lower than in the drought-stricken year of 1956.

Because the yield was not verified, not only was the completion of the grain purchase task affected, but also the conservative thinking in production was difficult to break. At that time, the County Party Committee estimated that the yield per mu in the county in 1957 was only 463 jin. Therefore, some comrades believed that the production plan for 1957, which required reaching 613 jin per mu, representing an increase of 33.1% over 1955, was "rash." When formulating the 1958 production plan, they were cautious and only afraid of making the "rash" mistake again. The target proposed at that time only required reaching 545.3 jin per mu in 1958. As for when to achieve "800 jin," they didn't even dare to think about it.

The More It Was Untangled, the More Chaotic It Became Due to Incorrect Methods

Obviously, the yield problem was a crucial one and had to be solved. But how to solve it?

In August, the County Party Committee convened a three-level cadre meeting. At the meeting, the ideological consciousness of the cadres present was raised through extensive airing of views, big debates, and big struggles. The meeting exposed the erroneous thinking of many cadres on the grain issue and revealed the fact that many cooperatives had concealed production yields in 1956. After the meeting, it was continuously revealed that many cooperatives had also concealed large amounts of production in 1957. However, at this time, it was only recognized that it was necessary to verify yields in order to do a good job in grain purchase, and the mass nature of concealment was not fully recognized. Therefore, as soon as we saw the experience of anti-concealment struggle introduced in the newspaper, we quickly accepted it. Thus, the anti-concealment struggle was launched throughout the county.

Because the anti-concealment struggle placed the leadership in opposition to the masses, problems arose as soon as it was implemented. After confession, denunciation, struggle, and even individual searches, a total of more than 2 million jin of concealed production was unearthed throughout the county. Adding the figures reported by the communes and teams, the county only had more than 83 million jin of grain, which was several million jin less than the "three-fix" production. A bigger problem was that at this time, grassroots cadres, especially work-point recorders and custodians, resigned one after another, saying: "After working for a year, there is no reward, and we are still being struggled against, so we will not do it." The commune members were also very dissatisfied, saying: "After working so hard, we are still suspected of stealing." Therefore, their morale was low, and production was passive. Some commune members and cadres who had actively participated in concealment bore a heavy ideological burden. If they spoke, they were afraid of being struggled against and punished; if they didn't speak, they were afraid of being denounced. Others actively formed alliances to protect themselves, becoming even more alienated from the Party and outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient. As for the cadres, because the anti-concealment campaign did not produce any results, their right-leaning conservative thinking became more entrenched. Some comrades resorted to methods such as extracting grain and searching granaries in disguise to complete the purchase tasks. As a result, the relationship between cadres and the masses and between the Party and the masses became more estranged, and contradictions deepened. The purchase task was not completed, and production was greatly affected.

Found a Key

The anti-concealment method did not work. What should be done? The County Party Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee, stopped the anti-concealment struggle and began to look for new methods. At this time, the Provincial Four-Level Cadre Conference was convened. The cadres of Lishui County unified their understanding of the situation through extensive airing of views, big debates, and big struggles at this meeting, which greatly enhanced their ideological consciousness. The fact that Lishui County's agricultural exhibition showed two years of increased production and two years of decreased production, and that the unit yield of grain in 1956 was among the lowest in the province, greatly stimulated the comrades who attended the meeting, especially the secretary of the County Party Committee. The comrades attending the meeting further debated the issue of whether production in 1957 was good or bad. Through the debate, right-leaning conservative thinking was initially overcome. After the ideological understanding was unified, the achievements of the work in 1957 were affirmed, and the grain yield in 1957 was determined to be 530 jin per mu. The experiences and lessons of leading production in the first five-year plan were summarized, the determination to change the low-yield situation was established, and the momentum was boosted. It was requested that the grain yield per mu in 1958 be ensured to be 650 jin and strived to achieve 700 jin per mu. Major production increase measures such as changing the system of 100,000 mu and building 1.08 million workdays of water conservancy were proposed. After returning to the county, a meeting of district and township secretaries was held, and a county agricultural exhibition was also held. The methods of displaying yields, comparing highs and lows, finding reasons, grasping key points, and setting plans adopted at the Provincial Four-Level Cadre Conference were learned and adopted. The confidence and determination to achieve a great leap forward in production in 1958 were boosted, and opinions on publicizing the agricultural development program, carrying out summary and evaluation, organizing a great leap forward in production, and combining it with the verification of yields were put forward.

As soon as this method was proposed, the comrades of Longjiang Township mobilized the masses to summarize and evaluate production achievements and experiences, and the results were very good. First of all, on the issue of yield, the district committee estimated that the township would only yield 580 jin per mu according to the Provincial Four-Level Cadre Conference. After mobilizing the masses to carry out the summary and evaluation, the production team leaders reported that the number was 614.5 jin (an increase of 47% compared to the first self-report of 417 jin per mu by the communes and teams). At the same time, a production increase plan for 1958 was drawn up, which increased the production enthusiasm of the masses, and no resistance occurred at all. The County Party Committee immediately sent a working group to earnestly summarize the experience of Longjiang Township, introduced it at the County Backbone Meeting in mid-December, and decided to earnestly implement the spirit of the Second Session of the Second Provincial Party Congress, carry out the whole people's rectification throughout the county, launch a mass summary and evaluation movement, push winter production to a high tide, promote a great leap forward in agricultural production, and at the same time combine the verification of yields to complete the purchase task. After the meeting, Bihu Town implemented the instructions of the County Party Committee, learned and developed the experience of Longjiang Township, and achieved great results.

After the County Backbone Meeting, Bihu Town convened a meeting of cadres above the production team leader level of the three agricultural cooperatives in the town. At the meeting, the socialist education centered on the "Forty Articles" was deeply implemented. Through the debate on the three questions of whether or not to have a great leap forward, whether or not a great leap forward was possible, and how to have a great leap forward, it was proposed that a great leap forward in production must have a leap forward thinking, leap forward conditions, and leap forward experience. It was explained that the summary and evaluation was a method of promoting a great leap forward in production. Everyone was called upon to speak out about every bit of experience and achievement, and the Party's policies were explained to address the ideological concerns of cadres and the masses. The leadership's attitude was clarified, and everyone was called upon to "eliminate concerns, break conservatism, liberate thinking, speak out about experience, show achievements, and strive to be selected as models." At the meeting, through repeated discussions and correcting attitudes, Bihu Second Cooperative was cultivated as a typical example to specifically introduce achievements and experiences. After the introduction of Bihu Second Cooperative, Bihu First Cooperative and Bihu Third Cooperative felt unconvinced and seriously discussed their own experiences and achievements and reported them at the meeting. According to the bumper harvest materials reported by each cooperative, the yield greatly exceeded the original estimated 630 jin per mu by the town committee. The town committee praised the enthusiasm of the cadres at the meeting and further pointed out the direction to the commune cadres, asking them to mobilize all commune members to carry out summary and evaluation, and then come to the town to hold a meeting for evaluation on this basis.

After the town production team leader meeting ended, the cadres of each cooperative conducted the same socialist education centered on the "Forty Articles" to the commune members. After raising the consciousness of the masses, a truly mass summary and evaluation movement was carried out. They told the masses that four types of people have the experience of a great leap forward: First, old farmers who are active in production; second, young people who are enthusiastic about labor; third, good commune members who love the commune like their home; and fourth, team leaders and commune cadres who actively lead production. Only lazy people who are negative about labor have no experience. As soon as they said this, everyone was willing to talk about their experience, and everyone wanted to be a model. The cadres also went around spreading and inspiring them, and the enthusiasm of the masses became even higher. Some commune members who originally had concerns gradually broke through their concerns under the influence of the atmosphere of "advancement is glorious, backwardness is shameful," and gradually reported high-yield models and comprehensive yield figures from one plot, one mu, and one piece of land to the entire team and the entire commune. In order to further educate the masses and exchange experiences, the town committee held a town-wide conference to introduce bumper harvest experiences and proposed that each team write five red-letter lists: (1) Annual high-yield models; (2) Comprehensive yield achievements; (3) Various bumper harvest experiences; (4) Commune members' labor attitude checks (published person by person according to labor base scores and labor work points); (5) Rationalization proposals; these lists were posted, publicized, and exhibited at the town meeting to facilitate better comparison and learning from each other and to serve as a basis for evaluation. As a result, the morale of the commune members was even higher. After further education and fierce ideological struggles, a few teams with concerns also wrote down the bumper harvest achievements and experiences of 1957 in a realistic manner.

After calculating based on the materials on the red-letter lists, the yield of the entire town had reached 943 jin per mu. The town committee, according to the instructions of the county committee, further went deeper to thoroughly find out where the yield went. As a result, some commune members and commune cadres had fierce ideological struggles again. Some complained to each other and regretted reporting the actual yield during the summary and evaluation. The production morale of individual teams fell again, and they even stopped going to the fields. Some town cadres also wavered and doubted that the reported yield was too high. In response to this situation, the town committee further went into key teams to conduct education through small-scale forums, found out the bottom line, and cultivated typical examples of publicly dividing private accounts. As a result, the confidence of the leadership was strengthened. A meeting of team leaders, work-point recorders, and custodians was convened to further implement education and criticize the individualistic idea of "being glorious politically and selfish economically," further clarify policies, eliminate concerns, and propose slogans such as "publicize accounts, complete procedures, and distribute reasonably." In this way, all the rough accounts of each team's private distribution of grain were publicized, and the procedures were completed. After the accounts were handed over, team-to-team review and joint evaluation were organized. The result of the yield verification was that the yield of the three cooperatives in the entire town reached an average of 1,001 jin per mu, an increase of 129.6% compared to the first reported number of 436 jin, and more than doubled the bumper harvest year of 1955.

After carrying out the whole people's rectification, conducting summary and evaluation, and verifying the yield, the ideological burdens of cadres and the masses were lifted, their voices became louder, and there were no more complaints of poverty and hardship. They also told the leadership the truth and told the cadres about the false struggles during the anti-concealment campaign. Production morale was unprecedentedly high, and the attendance rate and labor efficiency were greatly improved. The attendance rate of the entire town increased from more than 650 people per day before the rectification to 1,074 people. The 1958 production plan was also revised, from ensuring "800 jin town" in 1958 and striving to achieve "1,000 jin town" to ensuring "1,200 jin town" and striving to achieve "1,400 jin town."

The Knot Was Untied

The experience of Bihu Town found a key for the current work of the entire county. The County Party Committee attached great importance to their experience. On the basis of carrying out summary and evaluation in all townships and communes throughout the county, the County Party Committee convened the Socialist Construction Activist Hero Conference on January 13. Mei Zhiren, the head of Bihu Second Cooperative, and Liang Fengming, the head of Bihu Third Cooperative, personally introduced the experience of Bihu Town. At the conference, visits to advanced communes were organized, and the methods of displaying yields, comparing highs and lows, and finding reasons were adopted. County labor models were selected, further encouraging the commune cadres to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced. After the meeting, commune cadres from Bihu Town were organized to conduct touring introductions in various districts and townships, and the old accounts of private distribution of each production team in Bihu Town were exhibited. As a result, the yield of the entire county was quickly verified. The resistance situation of a few townships and communes also changed. Now, only 11 of the 191 cooperatives in the county have not been verified. After the final verification, the average yield per mu in the county in 1957 was 664 jin, an increase of 52.5% compared to 1955, greatly exceeding the original estimated number. The bottom line that had not been figured out for many years was finally figured out. It turned out that it was not that the production was not a bumper harvest, but that the ideology was not a bumper harvest, and the work was not done well. This difficult knot was finally untied. At the same time, the County Party Committee convened the Ninth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting to deeply criticize right-leaning conservative thinking and solve some long-standing problems. On this basis, the plan determined at the Provincial Four-Level Cadre Conference to achieve "800 jin county" in three years was revised to ensure "800 jin county" in 1958 and strive to achieve "900 jin county," and the water conservancy and other plans were revised accordingly, determining to increase from the original 1.08 million workdays to 2 million workdays (each labor force bears 59 workdays). Now, the cadres and the masses are all full of energy, and the attendance rate is unprecedentedly high. 57,000 people participate in production every day, accounting for 47.7% of the total agricultural population. Many cadres carry their bedding to the construction site, participating in production, leading production, and leading airing of views at the same time. The vast majority of cadres have engaged in experimental fields and experimental mountains. Under the influence of the two high tides of rectification and production, tasks such as grain purchase, public bonds, loan recovery, savings, and conscription have all been overfulfilled. This period of work has made us deeply realize that rectification is the key to raising all work, made us deeply realize that we must believe in the Party, believe in the majority of the masses, adhere to the working method of the mass line, and at the same time made us initially touch on some specific experiences of carrying out the whole people's rectification in rural areas. These experiences mainly include the following points:

Three Specific Experiences

(1) Start from production, verify the yield, and promote a great leap forward in production. From the current situation, the main task of rural rectification is to overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking of the leadership and the bureaucratic style of leading production that is divorced from production and does not understand production, to overcome the selfish and individualistic departmentalism thinking of the masses, and the capitalist thinking of a few wealthy farmers, and these problems are concentratedly reflected in the grain yield problem. The yield problem is the focus of the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism in rural areas, the main aspect of the contradiction between farmers' private ownership concept and collectivism, and at the same time, it is the material condition for rational distribution and the basis for formulating plans and carrying out "three guarantees" for the great leap forward in production. In 1957, Bihu Third Cooperative could distribute about 1.4 yuan per labor day remuneration, but before the yield was verified, only 0.57 yuan was distributed on the books, which was 0.16 yuan lower than in the drought-stricken year of 1956. Therefore, the yield problem is also directly related to the consolidation of the socialist position in rural areas. It is a crucial problem in the current work. In the rectification, we must grasp this key problem and solve it thoroughly. However, solving the yield problem cannot be solely for the purpose of completing the purchase task to verify the yield. We must start from production, grasp the urgent demand of the masses for a great leap forward, and mobilize the masses to find the conditions for a leap forward, the experiences for a leap forward, and the basis for a leap forward, and naturally combine to solve it in this process.

(2) Carry out summary and evaluation and adhere to the mass line. The mass summary and evaluation movement is actually a concrete form of the whole people's rectification in rural areas. Because the summary and evaluation starts from encouraging and promoting the revolutionary heroism of the masses, mobilizing the masses to summarize experiences and select models, this is more easily loved by the farmers. Carrying out summary and evaluation must first summarize production (work), show achievements, talk about experiences, show problems, and find lessons, which will naturally carry out extensive airing of views, big debates, and big struggles. At the same time, rectification can also be combined, which will draw a clear line between right and wrong, correct the political direction, exchange work experiences, clarify the direction of progress, and strengthen the confidence in progress. Secondly, through the evaluation and selection of models, the comparison of patriotism and love for the commune, labor attitude, and other conditions from bottom to top will inevitably launch a mass criticism and self-criticism movement. The models selected have established advanced banners and examples among the masses, encouraging and urging the backward to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced. This not only directly plays an important role in overcoming the contradiction between the advanced and the backward, but also naturally conducts a specific mass appraisal of every Party member, League member, commune cadre, and male and female commune member (without filling out forms or passing). This creates very good conditions for the organizational construction of the rectification of the commune, the rectification of the Party, and the rectification of the League. The landowners, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries can also be subjected to more specific supervision by the masses through summary and evaluation. They can be reviewed and evaluated on the basis of the summary and evaluation. Those who abide by the law and accept transformation and perform well can be promoted to commune members or probationary commune members, and those who perform badly can be demoted to controlled production or dealt with according to law.

(3) Constantly overcome right-leaning thinking within the Party and gradually improve the consciousness of the masses. To truly achieve two great harvests in ideology and production, we must have a thorough and tenacious revolutionary spirit, constantly overcome right-leaning thinking within the Party, and gradually improve the consciousness of the masses. After the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front in 1956, a tendency to deviate from politics grew within the Party. It was mistakenly thought that the consciousness of the farmers was improved after they joined the commune. Especially on the grain issue, leadership was relaxed as a result. Only allowing each agricultural commune to combine the distribution to self-report yields, reporting as much as they wanted, and mistakenly concluding that 1956 decreased production by 22% compared to 1955. In the year 1957, political and ideological work was strengthened, but right-leaning conservative thinking could not be solved all at once. For example, on the yield issue, the initial estimate was only 463 jin per mu, then increased to 530 jin, and after mobilizing the masses, it actually reached 664 jin. The 1958 production target was also raised from 545 jin per mu to ensuring 800 jin. In the rectification process, we must also use a thorough and tenacious revolutionary spirit to constantly fight against right-leaning thinking. Liu Chuntai, the Secretary of the Bihu Town Party Committee, initially thought that 630 jin per mu in the town was too high. Later, during the summary and evaluation process, the masses estimated that they could reach more than 800 jin, and he panicked, fearing that it was fake. He called the county committee three times overnight to ask for instructions. After the county committee instructed him to firmly believe in the masses, he strengthened his thinking. However, later, when clarifying the ins and outs of the yield, a few commune members clamored dissatisfaction, and the production morale declined. Some comrades also suspected and wavered. The town committee promptly rectified the team and cultivated typical examples before handing over all the old accounts and consolidating the victory. Throughout the entire work process, it is also necessary to give appropriate disciplinary punishments to those who have serious right-leaning thinking and refuse to correct themselves after repeated education.

In the movement, the leadership must also be good at grasping the law of ideological development of the masses, timely grasp the ideological changes of the masses, put forward appropriate slogans, repeatedly explain policies and reasons, gradually improve the consciousness of the masses, and eliminate their concerns one by one, to guide the masses forward. Bihu Town did a better job in this regard. They stipulated that cadres should not criticize, not pursue, not force, not urge, not resist, and not say conclusive words. In terms of methods, they emphasized starting small and then large, starting with experience and then with bumper harvests, and starting with specifics and then with principles to adapt to the ideological characteristics of farmers, and the problems were dealt with more deeply. The consciousness of the masses was improved, and the concerns were eliminated, and they handed over the old accounts and told the truth.

    工作方法对了头　困难问题迎刃解
    中共丽水县委员会关于开展全民整风运动，核实粮食产量，推动生产大跃进的工作报告摘要
    编者按：丽水县委的这篇十分深刻的和生动的报告，提供了一个正确处理人民内部矛盾的典型经验。丽水县的许多乡社干部和农民，由于存在着严重的个人主义和本位主义，普遍隐瞒产量，因而生产成绩和高额丰产的经验被埋没了，合作化的优越性显示不出来，干部的思想包袱沉重，群众的生产积极性大受压抑。最初，县委想用“反瞒产斗争”的压服办法去摸清产量之底，结果弄得干部和群众的关系十分紧张，群众思想更加混乱，消极抵抗的情绪更加严重。其后县委改变了这种泄气的办法而用鼓气的办法，从宣传“四十条”入手，展开总结评比，组织生产大跃进，结合核实产量，迅速地解开了长期不能解开的结子，大大提高了群众的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性。不但核实了去年的粮食产量，保证了国家购粮计划的完成，而且更重要的是推动了生产大跃进。该县原来的规划是三年实现八百斤县，现在改为今年实现八百斤县，争取实现九百斤县。丽水县的经验表明，两种不同的工作方法会得出完全不同的结果。目前全国还有不少地方对核实产量、解决粮食统购统销问题，特别是从积极地进行社会主义教育入手，鼓起干部和群众的生产积极性，组织生产大跃进，还缺乏有效的办法，丽水县的经验很值得各地参考。
    丽水县开展全民整风运动，掀起整改高潮和生产高潮，摸清了干部群众的思想底子、过去的工作底子和生产底子，核实了1957年的粮食产量，由原预计每亩四百六十三斤，提高到六百六十四斤。在此基础上修订了保守的规划，由原来三年实现“八百斤县”改为1958年确保实现“八百斤县”，争取实现“九百斤县”，从而取得了思想上和生产上的两大跃进，大大地推动了当前的生产和各项工作。
    丰收后出现一个难解的结子
    丽水县地处浙江南部、瓯江中游，是个山区县。由于山多岗多，水利条件不好，耕作方法粗糙，过去产量不高。1952年每亩粮食作物产量只四百二十九斤。解放以来由于党和政府在领导农民发展生产中作了巨大的努力，1955年冬实现了高级合作化，1957年一年来，县委接受了1956年的经验教训，转变了领导作风，下放了一百多名干部加强基层，几次地整顿了合作社，大力地改变了耕作制度，加上年景风调雨顺，没有特大的自然灾害，因而社社增产、样样作物丰收。但是，秋收一开始，我们就碰到一个难解的结子。上半年，干部群众都反映：“1957年生产季节抓紧好，改变耕作制度因地制宜好，干部参加生产好，天气风调雨顺好，稻苗生长好。”可是一收割，口气就变了。他们说：“春花雨水多麦粒小，连作早稻连种两年，田力拔完不长谷，中稻扬花时遇南风，受旱灾，瘪谷多……。”总之，上报的产量不高，不少地方甚至比大旱的1956年减产了。
    由于产量未核实，不但完成粮食征购任务受到影响，生产上的保守思想也难打破。在当时，县委预计全县1957年每亩产量不过四百六十三斤。因此有些同志就认为1957年的生产规划要求达到每亩六百十三斤，比1955年增产33.1％是“冒进”的。在制订1958年生产规划时，就小心谨慎，只怕再犯“冒进”错误，当时提出的指标只要求1958年达到亩产五百四十五点三斤。究竟什么时候实现“八百斤”呢？连想也不敢想了。
    方法不对头越解越乱
    显然，产量问题是一个关键性的问题，必须解决。但怎样解决呢？
    8月份县委召开了三级干部大会，会上通过大鸣大放大争大辩，提高了到会干部的思想觉悟，暴露了不少干部在粮食问题上的错误思想，揭发了不少合作社在1956年瞒报产量的事实。会后又陆续暴露了不少合作社在1957年也大量瞒产。可是这时候仅仅认识到要搞好粮食征购工作必须核实产量，对瞒产的群众性也认识不足。所以一看到报纸上介绍反瞒产斗争的经验，就很快地接受了。于是反瞒产斗争就在全县范围内开展起来了。
    由于反瞒产斗争把领导置于和群众对立的位置上，一贯彻，问题就来了。经过坦白、检举、斗争，甚至个别的搜查，全县一共反出了瞒产二百多万斤，加上各社、队自报的数字，全县仅八千三百多万斤粮食，比“三定”产量还少几百万斤呢。更大的问题是这时候基层干部特别是记工员、保管员纷纷向我们提出辞职，他们说：“干了一年，报酬没有，还要挨斗，怎么也不干了。”社员也大为不满。说：“辛辛苦苦，干死还被人怀疑偷窃。”因而情绪低落，生产消极。一些曾积极参加瞒产的社员和干部，更背上了严重的思想包袱。讲吧，怕斗争，怕被罚；不讲又怕被检举。另有一些人就积极订攻守同盟，更加和党离心离德、阳奉阴违了。干部呢，由于反瞒产也反不出什么名堂，右倾保守思想更巩固了。有些同志就变相地采取了抽粮、搜仓等的方法来完成征购任务。这样一来，干群、党群关系更疏远，矛盾更加深了。征购任务没有完成，生产也受到极大的影响。
    找到了一把钥匙
    反瞒产的方法行不通，怎么办呢？县委遵照省委、地委指示，停止了反瞒产斗争，开始寻找新的方法。这时，省四级干部大会召开了。丽水县的干部在这次会上通过大鸣大放大争大辩，统一了对形势的认识，大大提高了思想觉悟。省农业展览会展出的丽水县二年增产、二年减产，1956年粮食单位产量属于全省最低的一类的事实，也给参加会议的同志特别是县委书记以很大的刺激。到会同志又对1957年生产搞得好坏的问题进一步展开了争论。通过争论，右倾保守思想初步克服了。思想认识统一后，肯定了1957年的工作成绩，确定了1957年粮食产量每亩五百三十斤，总结了第一个五年计划领导生产的经验教训，树立了改变低产面貌的决心，鼓起了劲头，要求1958年每亩粮食确保六百五十斤，争取实现每亩七百斤。并提出了改制十万亩、修水利一百零八万工等主要的增产措施。回县后又接着召开了一次区、乡书记会议，同时还举办了县农业展览会，学习采取了省四级干部会上摆产量、比高低、找原因、抓关键、订规划的方法，鼓起了1958年实现生产大跃进的信心和决心，并提出了宣传农业发展纲要，开展总结评比，组织生产大跃进，结合核实产量的意见。
    这个办法一提出，龙江乡的同志发动群众总结评比生产成绩和经验，结果很好。首先在产量问题上，区委根据省四级干部会议预计该乡每亩仅五百八十斤，发动群众开展总结评比后，生产队长自报数竟达六百十四点五斤（比第一次社、队自报每亩四百十七斤增加47％），同时还订出了1958年的增产规划，提高了群众的生产积极性，根本未发生什么顶牛的现象。县委即派工作组认真总结了龙江乡的经验，在12月中旬的县骨干分子会上进行了介绍，并决定认真地贯彻省二届二次党代大会的精神，在全县范围内开展全民整风，开展群众性的总结评比运动，把冬季生产推向高潮，推动农业生产大跃进，同时结合核实产量完成征购任务。会后，碧湖镇执行县委指示，学习并发展了龙江乡的经验，取得了很大的成绩。
    碧湖镇在县骨干分子会以后，即召开了全镇三个农业社的生产队长以上干部会，会上深入地贯彻了以“四十条”为中心的社会主义教育，通过要不要大跃进？能不能大跃进？怎样大跃进？三个问题的辩论，提出要生产大跃进必须要有跃进的思想、跃进的条件、跃进的经验，说明总结评比是推动生产大跃进的方法，号召大家把一点一滴的经验和成绩都讲出来，并针对干部群众思想顾虑讲解党的政策，表明领导态度，号召大家“消除顾虑，打破保守，解放思想，讲出经验，摆出成绩，争取当选模范。”在会上，通过反复讨论、端正态度，培养碧湖二社作典型，具体介绍成绩和经验。碧湖二社介绍后，碧湖一社和碧湖三社觉得不服气，也认真地讨论了自己的经验和成绩在会上进行汇报。根据各社自报丰产材料一算，大大超过镇委原预计六百三十斤的产量。镇委在会上表扬了干部的热情，而进一步向社干指出了方向，要求他们发动全体社员进行总结评比，在此基础上再来镇开会评比。
    全镇生产队长会结束后，各社干部同样地向社员进行了以“四十条”为中心的社会主义教育，在提高群众觉悟之后，真正开展了群众性的总结评比运动，他们对群众说四种人有大跃进的经验：一、生产积极的老农民；二、劳动热情的小青年；三、爱社如家的好社员；四、积极领导生产的队长和社干。只有劳动消极的懒汉没经验。这样一说，个个都愿谈经验，人人都想当模范，干部又在其中奔走传布、启发鼓动，群众的积极性就更高了，一些原来有顾虑的社员在“先进光荣，落后可耻”的空气影响下，也逐步打破顾虑，由一丘一亩一片逐步到全队全社地报出了高额丰产典型和全面丰产数字。为了进一步教育群众，交流经验，镇委又召开了全镇丰产经验介绍大会，并提出要各队写五张红字榜：（一）全年高额丰产典型；（二）全面丰产成绩；（三）各项丰产经验；（四）社员劳动态度检查（按劳动底分，劳动工分分类逐人公布）；（五）合理化建议；在全镇会场上张贴公布展览，以便大家更好地互相比较学习，并作为评比的依据。这样一来，社员的情绪更高了。少数有顾虑的队，经过进一步教育和激烈的思想斗争后，也实事求是地写出了1957年的丰产成绩与经验。
    根据红字榜的材料计算以后，全镇的产量已达到每亩九百四十三斤，镇委又根据县委的指示，进一步地深入下去，要彻底弄清产量哪里去了。这样一来，一些社员和社干又起了激烈的思想斗争，有的就互相埋怨、后悔不该在总结评比时报实产量，个别队生产情绪重又低落，甚至不下田了，镇干部也有个别发生了动摇，怀疑产量报的太高了。针对这种情况，镇委又深入重点队通过小型座谈教育，摸清了底子，培养了公开私分账目的典型。这一来，领导的信心坚定了，就召开了队长记工员保管员会议，进一步贯彻教育批判“政治上要光荣，经济上要自私”的个人主义思想，进一步阐明政策，消除顾虑，提出了“公开账目，补办手续，合理分配”等口号，这样就全部公开了各队历次私分粮食的草账，补齐了手续，在账目交齐之后又组织了队与队之间的审查联评。产量核实的结果，全镇三个合作社的产量达到平均每亩一千零一斤，比第一次上报数四百三十六斤增加129.6％，比大丰收的1955年还增产一倍以上。
    通过全民整风开展总结评比、核实了产量之后，干部和群众的思想包袱放下了，讲话也响亮了，装穷叫苦的没有了，并和领导上说了老实话，把反瞒产时假斗争的情况也和干部实说了。生产情绪空前高涨，出勤率和劳动效率大大提高。全镇出勤率由整风前的每天六百五十多人增加到一千零七十四人。1958年的生产规划也作了修改，由原来在1958年确保“八百斤镇”，争取实现
  “一千斤镇”，修改为确保“一千二百斤镇”，争取实现“一千四百斤镇”。
    结子解开了
    碧湖镇的经验为全县的当前工作找到了一把钥匙。县委对他们的经验十分重视。在全县各乡、社普遍开展总结评比的基础上，县委又于1月13日召开了社会主义建设积极分子群英大会，由碧湖二社社长梅芝仁和碧湖三社社长梁凤鸣现身说法，进一步介绍了碧湖镇的经验，并在大会上组织到先进社参观访问，采取摆产量、比高低、找原因的方法，选出了县劳动模范，进一步鼓舞了社干部学习先进、赶上先进的决心和劲头。会后，又组织碧湖镇的社干部到各区、乡进行巡回介绍，把碧湖镇各生产队私分的老账进行了展览。这样一来，全县的产量也迅速地核实了。少数乡、社的顶牛状况也转变了，现在全县一百九十一个合作社中未核实的仅十一个社。经过最后核实的产量，全县1957年每亩平均产量六百六十四斤，比1955年增产52.5％，大大超过了原来的预计数。多年没有摸清的底子总算摸清了。原来，并不是生产未丰收，而是思想未丰收，工作未做到家。这个难解的结子终于解开了。与此同时，县委召开了第九次全体
  （扩大）会议，深入地批判了右倾保守思想，解决了一些长期没有解决的问题。在此基础上，重新修订了省四级干部大会上确定三年实现“八百斤县”的规划，改为1958年确保“八百斤县”，争取实现“九百斤县”，并相应地修订了水利等规划，确定由原来的一百零八万工提高到二百万工（每个劳力负担五十九工）。现在，干部群众个个劲头十足，出勤率空前提高，每天参加生产的有五万七千人，占全部农业人口的47.7％，许多干部把铺盖背上工地，边参加生产，边领导生产，边领导鸣放。绝大多数干部都搞了试验田、试验山。在整改、生产两大高潮的影响下，粮食征购、公债、收贷、储蓄和征兵等任务都超额完成。这段工作使我们深刻地体会到整风是提起一切工作的纲，使我们深刻地体会到必须相信党、相信群众大多数，坚持群众路线的工作方法，同时还使我们初步地摸到了一些农村开展全民整风的具体经验，这些经验主要有以下几点：
    三点具体经验
    （一）从生产出发，核实产量，推动生产大跃进。从当前情况看，农村整风主要是克服领导上的右倾保守思想和领导生产脱离生产不懂生产的官僚主义作风，克服群众中的自私自利个人主义和本位主义思想，以及少数富裕农民的资本主义思想，而这些问题又集中地反映在粮食产量问题上。产量问题是农村资本主义与社会主义两条道路斗争的焦点，是农民私有观念和集体主义矛盾的主要方面，同时它又是合理分配的物质条件，是生产大跃进制定计划进行“三包”的基础。碧湖三社1957年每个劳动日报酬可分一元四角左右，但在产量未核实前在账面上却只分得五角七分，比大旱的1956年还低一角六分。因此产量问题还直接关系到农村社会主义阵地的巩固。是当前工作中的一个关键性的问题。在整风中，一定要抓住这个关键问题加以彻底地解决。但是，解决产量问题又不能单纯为了完成征购任务来核实产量，必须从生产出发，抓住群众对大跃进的迫切要求，发动群众找跃进的条件、跃进的经验、跃进的基础，在此过程中很自然地结合加以解决。
    （二）开展总结评比，坚持群众路线。群众性的总结评比运动，实际是农村全民整风的一个具体形式。因为总结评比是从鼓励发扬群众的革命英雄主义精神出发，发动群众总结经验评选模范，这更容易为农民群众所喜爱。而开展总结评比，首先必须总结生产（工作），摆成绩，讲经验，摆问题，找教训，这就自然而然地开展大鸣大放，大争大辩，同时也可结合进行了整改，这就划清了大是大非，端正了政治方向，交流了工作经验，明确了前进方向，坚定了前进信心。其次，通过评比选模，由下而上地对照爱国爱社思想、劳动态度等条件开展评比，就必然地开展一个群众性的批评与自我批评运动，选出的模范又在群众中树立了先进的旗帜和榜样，鼓励督促落后的向先进学习、赶上先进。这不但直接对克服先进与落后的矛盾起重要的作用，也自然而然地对每一个党团员、社干部和男女社员都进行了一次具体的群众性的鉴定（不填表不通过）。这就为整社、整党、整团的组织建设创造了十分良好的条件，对地主、富农、反革命分子也可通过总结评比，使他们受到群众更具体的监督，在总结评比的基础上对他们进行审查评议，守法而又接受改造表现好的可升为社员或候补社员，表现坏的可降为管制生产或依法处理。
    （三）不断地克服党内右倾思想，逐步地提高群众觉悟。要真正取得思想上和生产上的两大丰收，就必须有彻底顽强的革命精神，不断地克服党内的右倾思想，逐步地提高群众的觉悟。1956年在经济战线上取得社会主义革命的胜利之后，党内曾滋长了一种脱离政治的倾向，错误地以为农民入社了，觉悟就都提高了，特别在粮食问题上，就因此而放松了领导，只是听凭各农业社结合分配自报产量，报多少算多少，错误地下了1956年比1955年减产22％的结论。1957年一年来，政治思想工作有了加强，但右倾保守思想也并不是一下子就能解决的。如产量问题上开始估计每亩只四百六十三斤，后来增加到五百三十斤，发动群众后竟达到六百六十四斤，1958年的生产指标也由每亩五百四十五斤提高到确保八百斤。在整风过程中也必须以彻底顽强的革命精神，来不断地和右倾思想作斗争。碧湖镇镇委书记刘春泰同志开始认为镇里每亩六百三十斤也太高，后来总结评比过程中群众自报预计可达八百多斤，即惊慌起来怕搞假了，连夜三次打电话向县委请示，经县委指示要坚决相信群众，才坚定了思想。但以后在弄清产量的来龙去脉时，有少数社员叫嚣不满，生产情绪低落，一些同志又怀疑动摇了。镇委及时地整顿了队伍，培养了典型，才全部交出了老账巩固了胜利。在整个工作过程中还必须对那些有严重右倾思想屡教不改的分子给以适当的纪律处分。
    在运动中领导还要善于掌握群众的思想发展规律，及时地掌握群众的思想变化，提出恰当的口号，反复地讲政策讲道理，逐步地提高群众的觉悟，逐个地消除他们的顾虑，来引导群众前进。碧湖镇这点做得较好，他们对干部规定不批、不追、不逼、不催、不顶牛、不说定局话，在方法上强调先小后大、先经验后丰产、先具体后原则等以适应农民的思想特点，问题搞得较深。群众觉悟提高了，顾虑消除了，就交出了老账讲出了实话。
