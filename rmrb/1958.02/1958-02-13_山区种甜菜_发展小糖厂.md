Enshi Prefecture in Hubei Province has gained experience in using mountainous areas to grow sugar beets and develop small sugar refineries. This year, they plan to plant 340,000 mu of sugar beets and establish 1,000 small sugar refineries, producing 60,000 tons of sugar. This will increase the income of each household in high mountain areas beyond their total agricultural income. This experience provides a good way to change the poor face of mountainous areas and develop local industry. Yichang and Xiangyang prefectures have also decided to use mountainous areas to plant sugar beets and set up sugar refineries. Hubei Province plans to plant 4 million mu of sugar beets and produce 1 million tons of sugar by 1962. This is a great contribution to the fact that the output value of local industry will exceed the total agricultural output value within five to ten years.

Joint Statement by Delegates Peng Yangqin and Fu Jingwen

Hubei's current sugar production is very small, only 200 tons in 1957. The province needs to consume 37,000 tons in 1958, mainly transported from Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Fujian and other provinces. The national supply is insufficient, so the market sugar supply is very tight. In order to develop sugar production, Enshi Prefecture in our province has gained experience in using mountainous areas to grow sugar beets and develop small sugar refineries.

Enshi Prefecture in Hubei Province is mostly a large mountainous area, located in the south of the Yangtze River, between 29° and 31° north latitude, with high and cold terrain, ranging from 400 to 2,700 meters above sea level. The highest temperature is 26.5°C, and the lowest is -14.4°C. Snow falls every year from October to March of the following year. The annual rainfall is about 1,700 mm, with moist slopes that are easy to drain. Under the premise of developing grain production and having enough grain to spare, it is suitable for planting sugar beets. The total area of the prefecture is 36 million mu, with only 6 million mu of cultivated land and 7 million mu of wasteland. Grain output is low, generally more than 100 jin per mu, so the income of the masses is relatively low. However, the average yield of sugar beets per mu can reach more than 2,500 jin, taking 1957 as an example. The income from sugar beets alone is 37.5 yuan per mu, and each labor day can earn about 2 yuan. In order to develop mountainous areas and improve the poor face of mountainous areas, the area began to try planting sugar beets in 1955. After three years of trials, it has been successful, and red and white sugar has been made using indigenous methods. The color and quality are good, which can meet the needs of the masses. The cost is low, the effect is great, the equipment is simple, the technology is easy, and it is easy to promote in large quantities, which is suitable for the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. In order to improve the poor face of high mountain areas, increase sugar production, and pave a clear road for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry.

Enshi Prefecture tried planting 200 mu of sugar beets in 1955. At that time, they did not know how to make sugar. In 1956, 6,000 mu were planted, but most of them could only be made into syrup, and dozens of jin of brown sugar were produced. The quality was poor, the smell was bad, the raw material loss was large, and the masses had great opinions. There was only one point where white sugar was produced (mainly with the help of technical personnel from Sichuan who made cane sugar). In 1957, 7,000 mu were planted, and more than 40 small earthen sugar factories were established. The sugar extraction rate was about 11%. The average yield of sugar beets per mu was about 2,500 jin, and the high yield generally reached about 8,000 jin. The highest yield was in one commune, which had more than 10 mu, and each mu reached 10,200 jin, and the income of farmers was very large. In the past, when they did not know how to make sugar, farmers complained that the government had arranged too much sugar beet planting. Now that the sugar made by indigenous methods is good, the farmers complained that the task of arranging sugar beet sowing was too small.

In 1958, it is planned to plant 340,000 mu of sugar beets, and the unit yield per mu can reach 3,000 jin. Organizing 20,000 people to go to the mountains can reclaim 100,000 to 150,000 mu of wasteland. Some agricultural cooperatives in the low mountains will establish branches in the high mountains, mainly planting sugar beets in high mountains above 1,500 meters above sea level, which does not conflict with grain and cotton. In terms of fertilizer, there are weeds and plants everywhere in the mountains, which can be burned into ash. There are many cattle and livestock, and there is manure that can be applied. Only a small amount of chemical fertilizer is needed to make up for the deficiency.

In 1958, it is planned to plant 340,000 mu of sugar beets and establish 1,000 small sugar factories, which can produce 60,000 tons of sugar, with a total output value of 68.866 million yuan. The national tax revenue is about 26.5 million yuan, the industrial profit is 11 million yuan, and the agricultural output value can be increased by 15.3 million yuan. According to the current population of 500,000 in high mountain areas, each household can increase its income by 150 yuan per year, exceeding the total income of other agriculture. In addition, the income from sugar beet stems, leaves, green tops and waste silk, which can feed 110,000 pigs or cattle, and the income from 10,000 tons of wine that can be brewed from waste molasses are not included.

Setting up 1,000 small sugar factories with a daily processing capacity of 5 tons of sugar beets, each requires an investment of only 3,000 yuan and 30 to 40 workers. In addition to requesting assistance from other regions in obtaining 2,300 centrifugal sugar separators and 2,000 slicers, the remaining equipment and tools can be solved locally.

The long-term plan for the Second Five-Year Plan is that in 1959, Enshi Prefecture plans to plant 1 million mu of sugar beets, and by 1962, it will plant 2 million mu. With a unit yield of 4,000 jin per mu, 4 million tons of sugar beets can be produced. Calculated at a sugar extraction rate of 14%, 560,000 tons of sugar can be produced. Calculated at 2% for waste molasses, 80,000 tons can be produced. Calculated at 76.5% for wine yield, 61,200 tons of wine can be brewed. Waste silk, stems, leaves, and green tops can raise 1.3 million to 1.6 million pigs or cattle. Farmers' income from sugar beets alone will increase eightfold compared to 1957, and national tax revenue and industrial profits may reach 195 million yuan.

The experience of Enshi Prefecture shows that sugar beets are very suitable for planting in mountainous areas. It is a valuable experience to prosper the mountain economy, increase sugar production, develop animal husbandry, and not conflict with grain production. Therefore, Yichang and Xiangyang prefectures in our province have also decided to use mountainous land to plant 360,000 mu of sugar beets in 1958 and set up small sugar factories for processing. The province plans to plant 4 million mu of sugar beets by 1962, which can produce 1 million tons of sugar. This is a great contribution to the fact that local industry will exceed the total agricultural output value within five to ten years.

    山区种甜菜　发展小糖厂
    湖北恩施专区利用山区种甜菜，发展小糖厂，已经取得经验，今年计划种植甜菜三十四万亩，建立小糖厂一千个，产糖六万吨，使高山地区每户增加的收入超过农业总收入，这个经验提供了一个改变山区穷困面貌和发展地方工业的好办法。宜昌、襄阳两个专区也决定利用山区种植甜菜、设置糖厂。湖北全省规划到一九六二年种甜菜四百万亩，生产食糖一百万吨。这对于五年到十年内地方工业产值超过农业总产值是一个很大的贡献。
    彭仰钦、傅景文代表的联合发言
    湖北目前的食糖的产量是很小的，一九五七年仅生产二百吨。全省一九五八年需消费三万七千吨，主要靠广东、黑龙江、福建等省运来，全国货源不足，因此市场食糖供应是很紧张的。为了发展食糖生产，我省恩施专区利用山区种甜菜，发展小糖厂，已取得经验。
    湖北恩施专区，大部是大山区，位于长江南部，北纬29°至31°，地势高寒，拔海四百至二千七百公尺，最高温度2650℃，最低—1440℃。每年十月至来年的三月降雪。年降雨量约一千七百公厘，潮湿坡地、易于排水。在发展粮食生产，粮食够吃有余的前提下，适宜种植甜菜。全专区面积三千六百万亩，现有耕地只六百万亩，荒地有七百万亩。粮食产量较低，一般每亩产量一百多市斤，因此群众的收入较低。但种甜菜每亩平均产量以一九五七年为例可达二千五百多市斤，只甜菜一项收入每亩即达三十七元五角，每个劳动日可收入二元左右。为了发展山区，改善山区穷困面貌，该区从一九五五年开始试种甜菜，经过三年试验，已经成功，并用土法制成红、白糖，色质良好，能适合和满足群众需要，成本低、收效大，设备简单、技术简易，便于大量推广，适合多、快、好、省的方针。为改善高山区的穷困面貌，增加食糖生产，发展农、畜牧业铺平一条明朗的道路。
    恩施专区一九五五年试种甜菜二百亩，当时不会制糖。一九五六年种六千亩，大部只能制成糖稀，产了几十斤红糖，质量次、有臭味，原料损失多，群众意见大。只有一个点，搞出白糖（主要找四川制蔗糖的技术人员帮助）。一九五七年种七千亩，建立小土糖厂四十多个，出糖率约百分之十一，每亩甜菜平均产量二千五百市斤左右，高产一般达八千市斤左右，最高产量有一个社有十多亩，每亩达到一万零二百市斤，农民收入很大。过去不会制糖时农民瞒怨政府布置甜菜种多了，现在土法制出的糖好，农民就瞒怨布置播种甜菜的任务太小了。
    一九五八年计划种植甜菜三十四万亩，每亩单位产量可达三千市斤。组织二万人上山，可开荒地十万至十五万亩。农业社低山的一部分到高山建立分社，主要将甜菜种在拔海一千五百公尺以上的高山，与粮食、棉花没有矛盾。肥料方面，山区到处有杂草植物，可以烧灰，牛马牲畜很多，有厩肥可施，只需少量化学肥料，以补不足。
    一九五八年计划种三十四万亩甜菜，建立小糖厂一千个，可产糖六万吨，总产值为六千八百八十六万元，国家税收约二千六百五十万元，工业利润一千一百万元，农业产值可增加一千五百三十万元，按高山地区现有五十万人口计算，每户每年可增加收入一百五十元，超过其他农业总收入。还有甜菜的茎叶、青头和废丝可喂猪或牛十一万头，废蜜可酿酒一万吨的收入未计算在内。
    设日处理甜菜五吨的小糖厂一千个，每个只需投资三千元，三十至四十个工人，除要求外区协助搞二千三百部离心分蜜机、二千部切丝机外，其余设备、工具当地均可自行解决。
    第二个五年计划的远景规划，一九五九年恩施专区准备种植甜菜一百万亩，到一九六二年种植二百万亩，每亩单位产量四千市斤，可产甜菜四百万吨，出糖率以百分之十四计算，可产糖五十六万吨，废蜜以百分之二计算，可产八万吨，出酒率以百分之七十六点五计算，可酿酒六万一千二百吨，废丝、茎叶、青头可养猪或牛一百三十万至一百六十万头，农民收入仅甜菜一项，将比一九五七年增加八倍，国家税收及工业利润可能达到一亿九千五百万元。
    恩施专区的经验，说明甜菜很适合在山区种植，是繁荣山区经济、增产食糖、发展畜牧业，而又与粮食生产没有矛盾的一个宝贵的经验。因此，我省宜昌、襄阳两专区，亦决定利用山区土地在一九五八年种植甜菜三十六万亩，设置小糖厂加工，规划全省到一九六二年可种植甜菜四百万亩，能生产食糖一百万吨，这对于五年到十年内地方工业超过农业总产值是一个伟大的贡献。
