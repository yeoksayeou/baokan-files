Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 1st – In the Heilongjiang Province, amidst thousands of miles of ice and snow, from cities to the countryside, from mines to forest regions, the movement to eliminate the four pests is unfolding everywhere. Seven million people across the province are participating in the movement.

　　On the evening of January 30th, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee held a broadcast rally in Harbin to review the mighty force of the people of the province in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene.

　　According to statistics from fifty-two counties within the province, in just one month, more than 2.23 million rats and 3.54 million sparrows have been eliminated. The main streets and alleys of many towns and villages, as well as courtyards, have undergone intensive cleaning. Harbin City has played a leading role in the province-wide movement. Currently, more than one million people in the city have joined the movement. In the past seventeen days, they have eliminated 250,000 rats and more than 210,000 sparrows. Ten rat-free streets, four hundred and twenty-seven rat-free residents' committees, and five rat-free suburban villages have emerged. In the Pingfang District, where a germ factory was once established during the Japanese puppet regime and plague outbreaks occurred, 95% of households have eliminated rats. Other cities within the province are rapidly catching up and aiming to match Harbin.

　　In the countryside, the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests is being combined with the high tide of the great leap forward in agriculture, advancing side by side. Communes are combining the manure accumulation movement with building toilets, urine pools, ash pools, paving drainage ditches, and building stables and pigsties to improve rural environmental sanitation. Many agricultural cooperatives have established sparrow-catching and rat-catching shock teams. In one day, the agricultural cooperatives in Hailun County encircled and annihilated 430,000 sparrows and 130,000 rats. Qinggang County has seen the emergence of three agricultural cooperatives that are basically "four-free" and twenty-three production teams that are basically "four-free."

　　Currently, the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests in Heilongjiang Province is developing towards breadth, depth, and sustainability. The Provincial People's Committee requires the province to resolutely eliminate the four pests and harmful insects such as bedbugs, lice, and fleas within five years, starting in 1958. Harbin City aims to become a sanitary city this year, achieving fly-free status in the urban area and basically eliminating rats, lice, bedbugs, and fleas. Sixty agricultural cooperatives in Qinggang County have requested to basically achieve "four-free" status within this year. Currently, a competition movement for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene is unfolding between cities and cities, counties and counties, streets and streets, cooperatives and cooperatives, and families.

　　黑龙江爱国卫生运动
    向广泛深入持久方向发展
    新华社哈尔滨1日电　在千里冰雪的黑龙江省境内，从城市到农村，从矿山到林区，处处都在展开除四害运动。全省参加运动的已有七百万人。
      1月30日晚上，中共黑龙江省委会、黑龙江省人民委员会在哈尔滨市举行广播大会，检阅了全省人民除四害、讲卫生的雄伟力量。
    据省内五十二个县的统计，仅仅一个月的光景，就灭鼠二百二十三万多只，灭麻雀三百五十四万多只。许多城镇的大街小巷和村庄、庭院都经过了突击清扫。哈尔滨市在全省运动中发挥了带头作用，目前全市有一百多万人投入了运动，最近的十七天内，就消灭了二十五万只老鼠和二十一万多只麻雀，出现了十个无鼠街、四百二十七个无鼠居民委员会和五个市郊无鼠村。在日伪统治时期曾经建立过细菌工厂、发生过鼠疫的平房区，已有95％的住户消灭了老鼠。省内其他各城市正急起猛追，向哈尔滨看齐。
    农村里以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，正和农业大跃进的生产高潮互相结合，齐头并进。社员们结合积肥运动，纷纷修厕所、尿池、灰池，垫污沟，修盖马棚、猪圈，以改善农村的环境卫生。不少农业社成立了捕雀捕鼠突击队。海伦县各农业社在一天里，就围歼了四十三万只麻雀和十三万只老鼠。青冈县已涌现了三个基本上四无的农业社，二十三个基本上四无的生产队。
    目前，黑龙江省以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，正朝着广泛、深入、持久的方向发展。省人民委员会要求全省从1958年起坚决在五年内消灭四害和臭虫、虱子、跳蚤等害虫。哈尔滨市今年就要成为卫生城，实现市区无蝇和基本上消灭老鼠、虱子、臭虫、跳蚤。青冈县有六十个农业社要求在今年内基本上实现四无。各地目前正在展开市与市、县与县、街与街、社与社和家庭之间的除四害、讲卫生的竞赛运动。
