Xinhua News Agency report: The leadership organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy and Naval Aviation issued circulars on the 19th, commending all officers and soldiers of a certain naval aviation unit for shooting down a Chiang Kai-shek RB-57 jet reconnaissance plane during the Spring Festival air battle.

The Navy's commendation order stated: This victory powerfully struck at the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft's attempts to intrude into the mainland. The victory in this air battle was due to the earnest preparations for war during the Spring Festival, the promotion of a positive combat style, and the correct guidance and cooperation of the air defense forces.

The commendation orders from the Navy and Naval Aviation leadership organs unanimously called on the officers and soldiers of a certain naval aviation unit to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, make persistent efforts, heighten vigilance, continue to strengthen war preparations, and resolutely strike at any aerial enemy who dares to harass the motherland's airspace.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, February 19th: The People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery units on the Fujian Front have recently shot down or damaged four Chiang Kai-shek aircraft.

At 9:49 AM on February 15th, four Chiang Kai-shek F-84 fighter jets intruded from the direction of Jinmen Island into the airspace south of Chihu in Fujian Province to harass the area. Our anti-aircraft artillery units immediately opened fire fiercely and accurately, shooting down one of them within five seconds. This Chiang Kai-shek aircraft crashed into the sea 35 kilometers from the mainland while burning. The remaining three Chiang Kai-shek aircraft fled in panic.

Prior to this, at 11:45 AM on February 11th, four Chiang Kai-shek F-84 fighter jets had just intruded into the Minjiang estuary area when one of them was damaged by our anti-aircraft artillery units. At 2:28 PM on February 12th and 9:11 AM on February 13th, two batches of eight Chiang Kai-shek F-84 fighter jets intruded into the airspace south of Chihu in Fujian Province to harass the area, when two of them were damaged by our anti-aircraft artillery units respectively.
