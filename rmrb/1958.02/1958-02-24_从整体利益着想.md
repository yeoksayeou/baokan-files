    Considering the Overall Interest
    I used to be a cadre in the Baotou City Tax Bureau. In this round of streamlining institutions and reducing staffing, I retired to return home to take care of household chores.
    When the leadership first began to mobilize me to retire and return home to do housework, I was ideologically resistant. I considered many issues, such as: after retirement, I would change from a cadre to a family member, which would be a big change in my personal life, from a daily routine of work and study to handling trivial household chores, cooking, boiling water, raising children, etc., and inconvenient actions (such as going to the movies, seeing plays), etc. There would also be a reduction in economic income. In terms of family status, would my husband look down on me after retirement, thus affecting the relationship between husband and wife and family happiness? In addition, I felt some pressure from public opinion…. After the Party's education and the help of comrades, I finally found the correct answer to these problems.
    What is the positive significance of the Party and the government mobilizing female workers with many children to retire and return home to do housework? We know that everything we do must start from the perspective of 600 million people. The current practice of reducing non-productive personnel and increasing productive personnel starts from the overall interests of the country. Then, does the country's adoption of this measure harm individuals and families? On the surface, it seems that economic income has decreased, but in reality, if you calculate it, for families with many children, income is less, but expenditures are also greatly reduced. Taking my situation as an example, the couple's monthly income is 140 to 150 yuan, and there are three children. The eldest has been raised by the elderly in the family since childhood, and all expenses are borne by the family. The second child attends kindergarten, and the third child is raised at home by a nanny. Because the family life is not well arranged, it often affects work. For example, because the child is sick, the adults must take leave, and both men and women not only have a mental burden but also distract their work energy. Returning home after retirement can reduce the state's administrative expenses and use the funds for construction undertakings, and family life can be arranged better.
    Are people with certain cultural knowledge and work ability unsuitable for engaging in household labor? I originally had a great deal of resistance to this point, thinking that I would have no future after returning home. Later, I thought it through and felt that everything cannot be separated from the reality of society. Under our socialist system, everyone's future is bright and happy, and our country has great hope, so how can individuals have no future? Of course, the knowledge required for engaging in simple household labor and engaging in more complex mental labor is different, but our society is a society where all aspects of work require a high level of cultural knowledge. In household labor, such as educating children, a certain amount of cultural knowledge is required. Therefore, it is not inappropriate to engage in household labor with cultural knowledge.
    According to my experience, from a comprehensive consideration of the interests of the country and individuals, all ideological problems are easily solved.

### 从整体利益着想

    从整体利益着想
    我原是包头市税务局的干部，就在这次精简机构和紧缩编制中，退职回家从事家务劳动。
    当领导上开始动员我退职回家从事家务劳动的时候，我的思想是不通的。我考虑到很多问题，例如：退职后，就由干部变成家属了，这在个人生活上起了一个大变化，由每天有规律的工作学习改为处理繁琐的家务事，做饭、烧水、抚养孩子等，行动上（如看电影、看戏）不方便等等。在经济收入上也减少了。在家庭地位上，退职后丈夫会不会看不起以至影响夫妇关系和家庭幸福呢？此外，感到社会舆论也有些压力……。这一些问题经过党的教育和同志们的帮助，我终于找到了正确的答案。
    党和政府动员子女多的女职工退职回家从事家务劳动的积极意义何在？我们知道，办一切事，都要从六亿人民出发，现在减少非生产人员、增加生产人员的作法就是从整个国家的利益出发的。那么国家采取这一措施，是不是对个人和家庭就有害呢？表面上看来，好像经济收入减少了，可是，实际算一下，对小孩多的家庭来说收入少了，支出也大大减少了。拿我的情况来说，夫妇双方每月收入一百四、五十元，三个小孩，老大从小就由家里的老人抚养，一切费用开支也均由家里负责，老二上幼儿园，老三在家请保姆抚养。由于家庭生活安排不好，常常影响工作，例如因为孩子生病，大人必须请假，男女双方不仅在精神上有负担，而且分散工作精力。退职回家，可以使国家减少行政开支，把资金用在建设事业上，而且家庭生活可以安排得更好些。
    有一定文化知识和工作能力的人是否就不适合参加家务劳动呢？这一点我原来抵触情绪很大，认为回家以后就没有前途了。后来我想通了，觉得一切都不能离开社会的实际，在我们社会主义制度下，每个人的前途都是光明幸福的，我们的国家是大有希望，个人怎么会没有前途呢？固然从事简单的家务劳动和从事较复杂一点的脑力劳动所需的知识有所不同，但我们的社会就是一个各方面工作都需要有高度文化知识的社会。家务劳动中如教育子女等，要求有一定的文化知识，因此，有文化知识从事家务劳动并没有什么不合适。
    按照我的体会，从国家和个人利益全面考虑，一切思想问题都是容易解决的。
