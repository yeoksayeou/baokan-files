　　On the issue of party leadership in literature and art, refute the rightists
　　He Qifang
    Bourgeois rightists oppose the leadership of the Party in all aspects. In politics, education, culture, and science, they have all launched frantic attacks, attempting to negate and abolish the leadership of the Party. The rightist elements and revisionist elements in literary and art circles have focused their sharpest attacks specifically on the issue of Party leadership in literature and art.
    On this issue, they have a common formula: our current literary and art situation is terrible, and the reason is bad Party leadership. Thus, they arrive at the conclusion: the Party should "stop leading artistic work as soon as possible," or, in a more roundabout way, the Party must lead literature and art according to their views. Leading literature and art according to the views of the bourgeois rightists, needless to say, is actually to abolish the leadership of the Party.
    Wu Zuguang said: "I have lived to be forty years old, and I have never seen such chaos as in the last few years." He believes that the "huge organizational strength" after liberation has hindered the "individual struggle" of artists. He slandered, saying that established artists "as a result of long-term 'reliance on the organization,' long-term brutal suppression and interference, are cautious, full of concerns, silent as golden statues, unable to move a single step, not to mention being difficult to compare with primary school students wearing red scarves, even more helpless than infants in nurseries, and have lost the ability to live independently." He also completely disregarded the facts, saying that no new talents have been cultivated in literature and art since liberation, and attempted to use this to negate the superiority of the socialist system. His conclusion is: "The organizational system is stupid. Stop leading artistic work as soon as possible."? He is so direct: the leadership of the Party itself has irreconcilable contradictions with literary and art work, and the way to resolve the contradiction is to simply not lead.
    Liu Shaotang's attack also begins with our current literary and art situation. He said that our literary creation is formulaic and conceptual, the content of life is poor, the artistic appeal is weak, and it has departed from realism. He believes that the literature of the Soviet Union and China has degenerated. He said that the literature of the Soviet Union in the last twenty years is worse than in the first twenty years; China's fifteen years from 1942 to 1957 are also not as good as the fifteen years from 1919 to 1934, because it did not produce writers like Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, and Cao Yu. He believes that the reason is dogmatism. He said: "It cannot be denied that since the national liberation, our theoretical guiding ideology has been conservative; and at the same time, it has been deeply influenced by foreign dogmatism, which has greatly hindered and restricted the development and prosperity of literary and art undertakings." What he refers to as "the theoretical guiding ideology is conservative" refers to the Party's adherence to the correct literary and art direction put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong in 1942, which has been proven correct by history; what he refers to as "foreign dogmatism" refers to Soviet literary theory, especially the theory of socialist realism. Therefore, he wantonly slandered Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art and socialist realism. He demanded that writers have the right to boldly and freely write about so-called "backward aspects" and "dark sides," write about female comrades' "curves" and "sexual stimulation"?。He is thus using the views of the bourgeois rightists to oppose the Party's correct literary and art ideas, oppose socialist realism, and oppose restricting erroneous and unhealthy tendencies in literature and art, even if only in theory.
    Exaggerating the shortcomings of our current literature and art, negating achievements, believing that dogmatism is the crux of all problems, and discrediting the Party's correct literary and art ideas as dogmatism, this is not just Liu Shaotang's argument, but a common argument of many rightist elements and revisionist elements in literary and art circles. Feng Xuefeng believes that "the works published in today's publications are not much different from the compositions of high school and junior high school students," slandering that we have "ideological control" over writers, and discrediting Soviet literature for lacking "the great spirit of mankind striving for socialism," "the fundamental problem is dogmatism"?。Chen Yong believes that "there are some problems in the Party's leadership over literature and art in terms of literary and art ideas," "namely, the problem of dogmatism"?。Huang Qiuyun said that dogmatism "seems to have permeated the spirit of our people and is deeply rooted and unbreakable," "it is almost like religion in the Middle Ages, and whoever does not pray and worship with the priest will inevitably be regarded as heresy"?。Qin Zhaoyang, who published "Realism - A Broad Road" under the pseudonym He Zhi, also used anti-dogmatism as a guise to attack the literature and art of New China and attack socialist realism. He said: "The bondage of dogmatism to literature and art is not only the situation in China, but also a worldwide situation." He believes that the formation of China's "various dogmatisms" is due to "the shortcomings of the definition of socialist realism" and "the vulgarized understanding and interpretation of 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'"?。His many arguments are similar to those of Liu Shaotang, but Liu Shaotang says it more bluntly, while he says it more euphemistically. These people, like Wu Zuguang, also say that the current literary and art situation is very bad, and the reason is that there is a problem with the Party's leadership. The only difference between them and Wu Zuguang is that they did not directly shout out that the Party should "stop leading artistic work as soon as possible," but instead discredited the Party's correct literary and art ideas as dogmatism, and then, under the guise of anti-dogmatism, attempted to abolish the Party's leadership.
    The common formula of the rightists cannot withstand refutation at all.
    How should we estimate our current literary and art situation? Our literary and art work is not completely without shortcomings and problems, but on the whole, contrary to the attacks of the rightists, our situation is not terrible, not degenerated, not inferior to 1919 to 1934, not inferior to before the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, but like other undertakings in our country, achievements and progress are the main aspect, and shortcomings are secondary, and are shortcomings in the course of progress.
    Who can deny these facts? The Party's correct literary and art ideas have been accepted by the vast majority of literary and art workers. This has enabled many established and future writers and artists to avoid going astray and reduce some detours. We should fully estimate the importance of this fact. Anyone who has experienced some detours and explorations on the road of literature and art will deeply understand the enormous significance of it. Under the guidance of the Party's correct literary and art ideas, many works with new qualities have been produced. Although, due to the short time, the most concentrated expression has not yet been found, their new qualities are very obvious. In the literary history of our country, in what era in the past have so many works appeared that reflect the lives of the people and are reflected from a clear revolutionary point of view? It is not enough to estimate the achievements of our literary and art undertakings from the perspective of improvement. It must also be seen that the popularization of literature and art has been largely realized in the past fifteen years. The combination of literature and art with the people, and the educational role it has played on the people, is unprecedented. It is precisely because of the realization of this popularization that the ranks of literature and art have been greatly expanded, many new writers and artists have emerged, and new readers and audiences have been prepared for literature and art. These are all conditions for the development and prosperity of literature and art.
    Of course, it is also a fact that no writers like Lu Xun have been produced in the past fifteen years. But writers like Lu Xun already belong to the few great writers in the literary history of our country, and they are not necessarily produced every fifteen years, or even every fifty years, or every hundred years.
    We can also say that it is also a fact that the level of general works is not high now. But this "not high" is a relative statement. Compared with our requirements, compared with successful works in literary history, we say it is not high. If compared with the level of general works in the fifteen years after the May Fourth Movement, it should be said that there has been progress. Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, and Cao Yu were the most accomplished writers at that time besides Lu Xun. Compared with them, the most accomplished writers in the fifteen years after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, even if they cannot catch up with them in some aspects, should be said to have made progress from the new nature of the works.
    What are the reasons why we do not have great writers now, and the level of general works is not high? I think there are many reasons. First of all, we should seek explanations from the tradition of the new literature and the situation of the writers themselves. Our entire literary tradition is very long, very rich, and very brilliant, and it has been accumulated for more than two thousand years. But our new literature only started from the May Fourth Movement. Generally, writers inherit mainly this tradition. Although particularly outstanding writers such as Lu Xun and other writers with greater achievements have also emerged since the May Fourth Movement, generally speaking, this tradition is still relatively weak, and the level of general works is still not high. In 1924, Lu Xun gave a speech called "Before the Appearance of Genius." In response to the calls for genius at that time, he replied: Before demanding the emergence of genius, we should first demand the soil that can cultivate genius. He himself spent his life doing a lot of translation and introduction and other work to prepare the soil. We can see from the history of Russian literature that many people had already done a lot of preparatory work before the emergence of great writers such as Pushkin and Lermontov. Other European countries often have similar situations. Since the May Fourth Movement, our work of preparing the soil for the emergence of genius has been constantly done by people. But even now, it is still not enough. The cultural level and the level of literature and art in our society are not high. The low level of general works is a reflection of this situation. Under these circumstances, if many superior conditions are particularly concentrated in an individual, his achievements can far exceed the general level at that time. Lu Xun was like this. But it is more difficult to produce great writers at the same time or in succession. Our writers, in addition to the general shortcomings of insufficient preparation and insufficient cultivation that are directly related to this social situation, also have other problems. Many older established writers are not familiar enough with the new life and new characters; many younger new writers do not have rich enough experience in life and writing; some writers have gone to do other things; some writers do not work hard enough, or their creative attitude is not serious, forming a state of stagnation or regression; and a few writers have degenerated and deteriorated. Although there are also writers with better conditions and preparations, and they are working hard, there are not many such people. These situations cannot but affect the current overall achievements. In summary, today we have many fundamental conditions that are conducive to creation, that is, our era, society, life, and direction; but there are also some conditions that are not good enough, that is, our new literary tradition is still relatively weak, the cultural level and the level of literature and art in our society are not high, and many of our writers themselves still have some problems.
    The fact that literature and art are particularly prosperous in a certain period, not so prosperous in a certain period, great writers appear in a certain period, and do not appear in a certain period, is a very complex social phenomenon that is not easy to explain accurately. I have tried to explain why our current literary and art situation is not very satisfactory. I think these are some of the reasons we should think about first. If we agree with this view, we will believe that the fact that today's literary and art situation is not very satisfactory is only a temporary phenomenon; the general trend is that after the high tide of economic construction, the high tide of culture will inevitably come, our literature and art will inevitably become more and more prosperous, and new great works will inevitably appear, only the early or late appearance of these works is difficult for us to predict.
    The Party is aware of these situations. The Party has been creating conditions for the prosperity of literature and art. From the proposal of the direction of serving the working people to the stipulation of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," from opposing the corrosion of bourgeois ideology on literature and art to mobilizing writers and artists to go to the people, from attaching importance to heritage to encouraging creation, all are for the purpose of changing the current situation of literature and art.
    Our revolutionary literary and art movement has been developing under the leadership of the Party. Without the leadership of the Party, there would be no revolutionary literary and art movement. Wu Zuguang seems to be quite eloquent in asking: "Who can tell me who led Qu Yuan in the past? Who led Li Bai, Du Fu, Guan Hanqing, Cao Xueqin, Lu Xun? Who led Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Beethoven, and Moliere?"? This is actually nonsense. The great writers and artists of ancient times lived in an era when the Communist Party had not yet been born, so it was naturally impossible to have the leadership of the Party. They often had to expose and criticize the unreasonable things of the time, so they were not so obedient to the ruling groups of the time. But they often had connections with the advanced ideas of the time, or with the people of the time. Some modern great writers lived in an era when the Communist Party had already been born, but the revolution had not yet been won, and they were limited by the prejudices of the old era and could not accept communism. This situation also exists. Naturally, there is no question of the Party's leadership over them. Tolstoy is like this. But there are also those who accepted the leadership of the Party in such an era. That is Lu Xun. That is Lu Xun, whom Wu Zuguang used as one of the examples of no leadership. The leadership of the Party did not bind his genius, but further developed it. In the era of proletarian revolution, the acceptance of the Party's leadership by writers and artists is a sign that he is moving towards revolution and towards the people. As for countries where the revolution has already been won, as long as they are writers and artists who are willing to serve the motherland and the people, it is even more unimaginable why they would not accept the leadership of the Party. As far as the entire literary and art movement is concerned, abolishing the leadership of the Party is to lead literature and art in the direction of the bourgeoisie, which is to destroy revolutionary literature and art. This is the essence of the dispute between the rightists and us.
    Wu Zuguang has a "theory" that "organization and individual are opposed, the organizational strength is large, and the individual strength is reduced."? We say that it depends on what kind of individual it is. If it is an individual who opposes the revolutionary organization, his relationship with the organization is indeed opposed. His individual strength will not only be reduced, but also be crushed. If it is a collectivist who can subordinate individual interests to collective interests, then his relationship with the revolutionary organization is not opposed, but harmonious, and the greater the organizational strength, the more the individual strength can be brought into play. In this case, the contradiction between the collective and the individual can be completely unified. As far as writers and artists are concerned, the Party gives direction and conditions to their undertakings, and they complete them with their individual efforts. We do not obliterate or reduce the importance of individual efforts at all. But if it is an effort that has lost its direction, then there can be no achievement; if there is a lack of certain necessary conditions, individual efforts will also encounter great difficulties.
    Of course, the Party's leadership we are talking about refers to the Party's overall leadership, that is, correct leadership. In our partial work, it is entirely possible to have shortcomings and errors. These shortcomings and errors are naturally unfavorable to the development and prosperity of literature and art, and unfavorable to the individual efforts of writers and artists. The Party has proposed opposing surrender to bourgeois ideology, opposing the leadership of administrative orders and simple and crude criticism, and opposing dogmatism and revisionism, all of which are aimed at the shortcomings and errors in literary and art work. We cannot say that our direction is correct, the Party's overall leadership is correct, and there is no need to improve literary and art work. We cannot say that there is no dogmatism in literary and art work. The separation of theory and practice is dogmatism. In some theoretical criticisms, in the minds of some cadres, dogmatism exists. But the dispute between us and the rightists and revisionist elements lies here: Is the Party's guiding ideology dogmatism? Liu Shaotang and others say yes; we say absolutely not. The Party has always opposed dogmatism. The Party's guiding ideology in literature and art is Comrade Mao Zedong's proposition in 1942 that literature and art should serve the working people, writers and artists should study Marxism-Leninism, study society, go to the people to obtain raw materials, transform their thoughts and feelings, and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" put forward after liberation for the development and prosperity of literature and art. What dogmatism is there in this?
    Liu Shaotang absurdly said that Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art has a "strategic theory" part, which was put forward based on the situation in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and is outdated and inapplicable after national liberation, but the Party still adheres to this "strategic theory," which is dogmatism and the root of formularization and conceptualization. The "strategic theory" he said has two contents: one is "at that time, literature and art served politics, which was bound to be manifested in serving policy articles"; the other is "at that time, on the issue of improvement and popularization, popularization was the main thing"?。Anyone who has read Comrade Mao Zedong's speech will know that there is no mention in it of literature and art must serve policy articles, this is just Liu Shaotang's fabrication. Comrade Mao Zedong only said that "the position of the Party's literary and art work in the Party's entire revolutionary work is determined and arranged; it is subordinate to the revolutionary tasks stipulated by the Party in a certain revolutionary period." What is the similarity between this and serving policy articles? Perhaps some people will say that although Liu Shaotang's fabricated words cannot be found in Comrade Mao Zedong's speech, there have been such facts in our literary and art work: some comrades who do propaganda work often require literature and art to timely publicize various policies, and writers and artists do this without distinction. If, for the sake of combat needs, writers and artists even have to take up guns sometimes, what is wrong with them using literary and art forms to publicize the Party's policies, to publicize those major policies that are particularly closely related to the revolutionary movement and the people's lives, under voluntary and possible conditions? What harm does it do to their creative activities? As long as those who do propaganda work and the writers and artists themselves do not have this wrong view, thinking that the role of literature and art is limited to this, thinking that serving politics is so narrow, there will be no problem. Furthermore, even if there have been some people who do not understand literary theory and creative laws, and they hold this wrong and narrow view, it is only a local phenomenon and a temporary phenomenon. Their view cannot represent and does not conform to the Party's guiding ideology. As for the issue of popularization and improvement, Comrade Mao Zedong once criticized some comrades for their contempt and neglect of popularization, pointing out that under the conditions at that time, the task of popularization was more urgent, and made a unified and dialectical explanation of the relationship between popularization and improvement. If we do not understand the meaning of popularization very narrowly, thinking that it only refers to writing popular reading materials, but understand it as literature and art should adapt to the needs and appreciation level of the broad masses of the people, literature and art should be oriented towards the masses, and should be popularized to the masses, then the task of popularization is more urgent and is applicable in the long term. What dogmatism is there in this? What bondage and hindrance does this have to writers and artists?
    Liu Shaotang also calls the theory of socialist realism dogmatism. Now it is very clear that Liu Shaotang, Feng Xuefeng, Qin Zhaoyang, and others, their attacks on Soviet literature, the most advanced literature in the world today, and their opposition to socialist realism, the most advanced literary and art trend in the world today, are nothing more than the pitiful echoes of the bourgeois elements and revisionists in Europe and the United States. This is indeed not only the situation in China, but a worldwide situation. "Ants trying to shake a big tree, ridiculous and overestimating their abilities," this is a true portrayal of them. Liu Shaotang plays a particularly ridiculous role in this. He cannot even understand a sentence and meaning that is originally very clear, "to truthfully, historically, and concretely describe reality from the revolutionary development of reality," and says without reason that this "does not first require writers to base themselves on the current life truth, and is not loyal to the most realistic life truth"?。It seems that it is not more true to regard and describe reality as developing and changing, but it is more true to regard and describe reality as static and unchanging. Liu Shaotang unreservedly and firmly opposes literature and art using socialist spirit to educate the people. He said: "If we do not remove educating the people with socialist ideas, it will inevitably produce conceptualization and formularization, and ignore the complex phenomena of life, and it will inevitably produce dogmatism"?。It turns out that in the eyes of the rightists, socialist ideas are dogmatism!
    On the issue of anti-dogmatism, our fundamental difference from the rightists and revisionist elements lies here: what we oppose is true dogmatism; what they oppose is the leadership of the Party, the principles and theories of Marxism. They slander these necessary and correct things as dogmatism in order to facilitate attacks. We say that in some theoretical criticisms, in the minds of some cadres, dogmatism exists. Will this dogmatism have a negative impact on literary and art work? It will. Precisely because of this, we not only oppose revisionism in literature and art, but also oppose dogmatism in literature and art. However, it should be explained that dogmatism is only one of the reasons for formularization and conceptualization in creation. Formularization and conceptualization can originate from dogmatism, or they can originate from writers and artists lacking life, not high ideological and artistic levels, shoddy production, and other reasons. It is also unrealistic to think that once the problem of dogmatism is solved, all the problems of literature and art will be solved.
    This is our refutation of the rightists' common formula of opposing the Party's leadership in literature and art.
    While opposing the Party's leadership and the Party's literary and art ideas, the rightist elements and revisionist elements in literary and art circles also put forward some of their own propositions. We may as well examine them briefly. Examining those propositions can make it clearer that the dispute between us and them is precisely the question of the direction and road of literature and art, that is, whether it is the socialist direction and road or the bourgeois direction and road. What does Wu Zuguang advocate to replace the Party's leadership? He can only put forward a "individual struggle," plus "writing books is all for food and clothing"?。This is a simple and clear bourgeois program. Relying entirely on the individual; and the individual's struggle is only for money. Liu Shaotang's program is slightly more complicated on the surface. He will talk about some words such as "realism," "complex phenomena of life," and "loyalty to life truth." But the actual writing tendencies that he promotes with these words are nothing more than, as we have already explained, one is to "reveal the backward aspects of life," and "the description of the dark side" cannot "retain a sense of propriety"; the other is to write "curves," to write "sexual stimulation," and to write "black dogs crawling under pants," and so on?。The latter is precisely one of the characteristics of the decadent literature of the European and American bourgeoisie today, and there is no need to comment on it. The former is nothing more than a replica of the so-called "exposing darkness" advocated and practiced by Wang Shiwei, Xiao Jun, Ding Ling, and Luo Feng in Yan'an. Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art has already made a solemn refutation of this reactionary proposition, and has thoroughly solved the problem in theory. It is worth noting that this long-bankrupt reactionary proposition has now been put forward by many rightist elements and revisionist elements, and it is quite common, not just Liu Shaotang alone. Feng Xuefeng, who has consistently despised the people and emphasized the backwardness of the people before liberation, now that the country has been liberated and has entered a socialist society, speaks loudly about "the suffering of the people" and advocates "singing praises and criticism, two wheels advancing together"?。Huang Qiuyun also advocates writing about "the dark side of life" and writing about "the sufferings of the people." He said, "Today, on our land, there are still disasters, there is still unemployment, there are still infectious diseases prevailing, there is still bureaucracy rampant, and there are still various unpleasant things and unreasonable phenomena." He praised the rightist element Liu Binyan's works depicting the "dark side" as highly as Chekhov's short stories?。Qin Zhaoyang opposed "almost" in "Realism - A Broad Road" and advocated "fresh attempts" and "bold originality." Just from these abstract words, we cannot see his true intentions. When we know that he is as nauseatingly praising Liu Binyan's works as Huang Qiuyun, saying in a letter to Liu Binyan that "you are opening up a new path of your own realism, and at the same time you are setting an example for others," and bragging to people that he dared to publish Liu Binyan's and other similar works when he was editing "People's Literature," we understand what his "fresh attempts" and "bold originality" are. Our literature and art cannot but describe the shortcomings in our work, and it should not criticize the negative and backward things in our lives. If it is described from a correct standpoint and with a correct attitude, it is entirely necessary. But these rightist elements and revisionist elements are very strange. They regard today's society and today's people's lives as the same as the past society and the past people's lives, and cannot see the fundamental differences between them and the fundamental changes that have taken place. The leap forward in all aspects of our country and the countless inspiring new atmospheres seem to not exist in their minds. When they mention "disasters," "unemployment," "infectious diseases," and "bureaucracy," they completely obliterate the various active and effective revolutionary measures we have taken for these phenomena, as if natural disasters, prevalent diseases, and all the problems left over from the old society have become the crimes of the new society. If the so-called "exposing darkness" in Yan'an at that time was a joint attack by counter-revolutionaries and anti-Party elements when the revolution encountered difficulties, then in the present era of building socialism, the anti-socialist intentions of these new "exposing darkness" theorists are obvious.
    Among the rightist elements, there are also those who use the technique of emphasizing art to negate the importance of politics, negate the importance of politics to artists, promote the fallacy that the creative practice of the Hu Feng group can transform thinking, and are obsessed with the lifestyle of bourgeois artists and their methods of cultivating artists on the issue of the relationship between politics and art. Chen Yong is like this. This is obviously also an attempt to lead our literature and art in the bourgeois direction and road. The relationship between politics and art is also an issue that we and the bourgeois elements have been arguing about for a long time. On this issue, we need to write another article to refute the rightists.　　　　　　　　January 29, 1958

　　就党领导文艺问题驳右派
　　何其芳
    资产阶级右派从各个方面反对党的领导。在政治、教育、文化、科学等方面，他们都曾猖狂进攻、妄图否定和取消党的领导。文艺界的右派分子和修正主义分子的锋芒特别集中在党领导文艺的问题上。
    在这个问题上他们有一个共同的公式，那就是：我们现在的文艺状况糟得很，原因就是党领导坏了。于是他们就达到了这样的结论：党“趁早别领导艺术工作”，或者比较曲折一点，党必须按照他们的观点领导文艺。按照资产阶级右派的观点领导文艺，不用说实际上也就是取消党的领导。
    吴祖光说：“我活到四十岁了，从没有看到像这几年这样乱过。”他认为解放后“组织力量庞大”妨碍了艺术家们的“个人奋斗”。他诬蔑地说，已成的艺术家们“由于长期地‘依靠组织’的结果，长期地被粗暴压制和干涉的结果，小心翼翼，顾虑重重，金人缄口，寸步难行，不要说难以比拟戴着红领巾的小学生，比保育院的婴儿还要难以自处，失去了独立生活的能力”。他又完全不顾事实地说解放后在文学艺术方面没有培养出什么新人，并企图以此否定社会主义制度的优越性。他的结论是：“组织制度是愚蠢的。趁早别领导艺术工作。”?他就是这样直接了当：党的领导本身就和文艺工作有不可调和的矛盾，解决矛盾的办法是干脆不要领导。
    刘绍棠的攻击同样是从我们现在的文艺状况开始。他说我们的文学创作公式化概念化，生活内容贫乏，艺术感染力淡薄，离开了现实主义。他认为苏联和我国的文学都退化了。他说，苏联后二十年的文学比前二十年差；我国从1942到1957的十五年也不如1919到1934的十五年，因为没有产生鲁迅、茅盾、巴金、曹禺那样的作家。他认为原因就在教条主义。他说：“不能不承认，全国解放以后，我们的理论指导思想是守旧的；而且与之同时又深深地受了外来的教条主义的影响，在很大程度上妨碍和束缚了文学艺术事业的发展和繁荣。”他所说的“理论指导思想是守旧的”，是指党坚持毛泽东同志在1942年提出的、已经为历史所证明的正确的文艺方向；他所说的“外来的教条主义”，是指苏联的文艺理论，特别是社会主义现实主义的理论。所以他对毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话和社会主义现实主义都肆意污蔑。他要求作家有权利大胆自由地写所谓“落后面”和“阴暗面”，写女同志的“曲线”和“性的刺激”?。他就是这样用资产阶级右派的观点来反对党的正确的文艺思想，反对社会主义现实主义，反对对文艺的错误倾向不良倾向加以限制，即使仅仅是理论上的限制。
    夸大我们现在的文艺的缺点，否定成绩，认为教条主义是全部问题的症结，并且把党的正确的文艺思想诋毁为教条主义，这不只是刘绍棠一人的论调，而是文艺界不少右派分子和修正主义分子所共同的。冯雪峰认为“今天刊物上发表的作品，与高中、初中的作文差不了好多”，诬蔑我们对作家有“思想上的管制”，并且诋毁苏联文学缺少“人类为社会主义奋斗的伟大精神”、“根本问题是教条主义”?。陈涌认为“党对文艺的领导存在着一些文艺思想上的问题”、“即教条主义的问题”?。黄秋耘说教条主义“仿佛已经浸润在我们人民群众的精神中，深入人心，牢不可破”，“这几乎有点像中世纪的宗教一样，谁要是不跟着神甫祈祷和作礼拜，就势必被目为异端邪说”?。以何直的笔名发表了“现实主义——广阔的道路”的秦兆阳，也是以反教条主义为幌子来攻击新中国的文艺，攻击社会主义现实主义。他说：“教条主义对于文学艺术的束缚，这不光是中国的情况，而且是带世界性的情况。”他认为中国的“种种教条主义”的形成是由于“社会主义现实主义的定义的缺点”和“对于‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’的庸俗化的理解和解释”?。他的许多论点都和刘绍棠相近似，只是刘绍棠说得很露骨，他说得比较曲折一些。这些人和吴祖光一样，也是说现在的文艺状况很不妙，原因在党的领导有问题。他们和吴祖光不同之处不过是他们没有直接了当地叫出党“趁早别领导艺术工作”，而是把党的正确的文艺思想诋毁为教条主义，然后在反教条主义的掩盖之下来妄图取消党的领导而已。
    右派分子的这个共同的公式是一点也经不起反驳的。
    我们现在的文艺状况到底应该如何估计呢？我们的文艺工作并不是完全没有缺点和问题，但总的说来，和右派分子的攻击相反，我们的状况不是糟得很，不是退化了，不是不如1919到1934年，不是不如延安文艺座谈会以前，而是和我们国家的其他事业一样，成绩和进步是主要的，缺点是次要的，而且是前进中的缺点。
    谁能否认这样一些事实呢？党的正确的文艺思想已经为广大的文学艺术工作者所接受。这使许多已成的和未来的作家和艺术家免于走入歧途，减少一些曲折。我们应该充分估计这个事实的重要性。凡是在文学艺术的道路上经历过一些曲折和摸索的人，都会深刻地理解到它的意义的巨大。在党的正确的文艺思想的指导之下，已经产生了许多具有新的性质的作品。尽管由于时间的短暂，还没有找到最集中的表现，它们的新的性质却是很明显的。在我国的文学史上，过去什么时代曾经出现过这样众多的作品，它们反映了人民群众的生活，而且是以明确的革命观点来反映呢？对我们的文艺事业的成就，单从提高的角度去估计还是很不够的。还必须看到，十五年来，文学艺术的普及已经在很大的程度上实现了。文学艺术和人民群众的结合，对于人民群众所起的教育作用，是空前未有的。正是由于这种普及的实现，文学艺术的队伍大为扩大了，出现了许多新的作家和艺术家，并且给文学艺术准备了新的读者和观众。这都是文学艺术发展和繁荣的条件。
    当然，这也是事实，十五年来并没有产生鲁迅那样的作家。但鲁迅那样的作家，已经属于我国文学史上为数不多的伟大作家之列，并不是每十五年，甚至并不是每五十年，每一百年，就一定会出现的。
    我们还可以说，这也是事实，现在一般作品的水平还不高。但这不高是一种比较的说法。比起我们的要求来，比起文学史上成功的作品来，我们说不高。如果和五四以后十五年的一般作品的水平相比，那就应该说已经有了进步。郭沫若、茅盾、巴金、曹禺，是鲁迅以外的当时最有成就的作家。从延安文艺座谈会以后十五年的最有成就的作家和他们相比，即使在某些方面还赶不上他们，从作品的新的性质说来，也应该说已经有了进步。
    我们现在还没有伟大的作家，一般作品的水平还不高，这又是由于什么原因呢？我想原因是多方面的。首先应该从新文学的传统和作家本身的情况去寻求解释。我们整个的文学传统，那是很悠久很丰富很光辉灿烂的，那是二千多年累积起来的。但我们的新文学却是从五四才开始。一般作家继承的主要是这个传统。五四以来虽然也曾产生了鲁迅那样特别杰出的作家和其他少数成就较大的作家，总的说来，这个传统还是比较薄弱的，一般作品的水平还是不高的。1924年，鲁迅作过一个讲演，叫做“未有天才之前”。对于当时要求天才的呼声，他是这样回答的：在要求天才的产生之前，应该先要求有可以培养天才的泥土。他自己的一生就作了很多翻译介绍和其他准备泥土的工作。我们从俄国文学史可以看到，在普希金和莱蒙托夫这些大作家出现之前，已经有许多人做了许多准备工作。其他欧洲国家，也常有类似的情况。五四以来，我们的这种为了天才的产生而准备泥土的工作，是不断地有人在作的。但直到现在，还是做得不够。我们的社会的文化水平和文学艺术水平还不高。一般作品的水平不高正是这种情况的反映。在这种情况之下，在个别人物的身上，如果特别集中了许多优越的条件，他的成就也可以远远超出于当时一般水平之上。鲁迅就是这样。但要同时产生或者相继产生伟大的作家，那就比较困难了。我们的作家，除了和这种社会情况直接有关联的一般存在着准备不足修养不足的缺点而外，还有其他问题。不少年纪较大的已成的作家对新的生活新的人物不够熟悉；不少年纪较轻的新作家生活和写作的经验都还不丰富；有些作家又做别的事情去了；有些作家努力不够，或者创作态度不严肃，形成停滞或退步的状态；还有少数作家蜕化变质了。尽管也有条件和准备都较好的作家，而且他们是努力的，但这样的人还不多。这些情况不能不影响到目前的整个的成就。总起来说，我们今天有许多根本有利于创作的条件，那就是我们的时代、社会、生活和方向；但也有一些还不够好的条件，那就是我们的新文学的传统还比较薄弱，我们的社会的文化水平和文学艺术水平还不高，我们的许多作家本身也还存在着一些问题。
    文学艺术在某个时期特别繁荣，在某个时期又不那么繁荣，在某个时期出现了伟大的作家，在某个时期又不出现，这是一种很复杂的社会现象，很不容易加以精确的说明。我们今天的文艺状况还不能很令人满意，我试为作了一些解释。我认为这是一些我们首先应该想到的原因。如果同意这种看法，我们就会相信，今天的文艺状况还不能很令人满意不过是一时的现象；总的趋势是随着经济建设的高潮之后，文化的高潮必然要到来，我们的文学艺术必然要日趋繁荣，必然要出现新的伟大的作品，只是这些作品的出现的早或迟，我们难于预料而已。
    党是注意到这些情况的。党一直在为文学艺术的繁荣创造条件。从为劳动人民服务的方向的提出到“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策的规定、从反对资产阶级思想对文学艺术的腐蚀到动员作家和艺术家到人民群众中去，从重视遗产到鼓励创作，都是为了改变文学艺术的现状。
    我们的革命的文艺运动一直是在党的领导之下发展起来的。没有党的领导就没有革命的文艺运动。吴祖光好像颇为雄辩地问道：“谁能告诉我，过去是谁领导屈原的？谁领导李白、杜甫、关汉卿、曹雪芹、鲁迅？谁领导莎士比亚、托尔斯太、贝多芬和莫理哀的？”?这其实不过是胡扯。古代的大作家大艺术家生活在共产党还没有产生的时代，当然不可能有党的领导。他们对于当时的不合理的事物常常要进行揭露和批评，因此他们对于当时的统治集团也并不是怎样顺从的。但他们和当时的先进思想，或者和当时的人民，都常常有着联系。近代的某些大作家，他们活着的年代共产党已经产生了，然而革命还未取得胜利，他们囿于旧时代的偏见，还不能接受共产主义，这种情况也是有的。这自然也谈不上党对他们的领导。托尔斯太就是这样。但也有就是在这样的时代接受了党的领导的。那就是鲁迅。那就是吴祖光用来作为没有领导的例子之一的鲁迅。党的领导并没有束缚他的天才，而是更加发展了它。在无产阶级革命的时代，作家和艺术家接受党的领导，正是标志着他走向革命，走向人民。至于在革命已经取得胜利的国家，只要是愿意为祖国和人民服务的作家和艺术家，那就更无法想像他们为什么不接受党的领导了。就整个文艺运动来说，取消党的领导，就是要把文学艺术引向资产阶级的方向，就是要毁灭革命的文学艺术。右派分子和我们之间的争论的实质就在这里。
    吴祖光有一个“理论”，他说，“组织和个人是对立的，组织力量庞大，个人力量就减少。”?我们说，那要看是什么样的个人。如果是和革命的组织对抗的个人，他和组织的关系的确是对立的。他的个人力量不止要减少，而且要被粉碎。如果是集体主义者，能够以个人的利益服从集体的利益，那他和革命的组织的关系就不是对立的，而是和谐的，组织的力量越大，个人的力量也就越能得到发挥。在这种情况下，集体和个人的矛盾是完全可以统一的。就作家和艺术家来说，党给他们的事业以方向和条件，他们以个人的努力来完成。我们一点也不抹杀或降低个人的努力的重要。但如果是迷失了方向的努力，那就不可能有成就；如果缺乏某些必要的条件，个人的努力也将遭到很大的困难。
    当然，我们所说的党的领导是指党的整个的领导，也即是正确的领导。在我们的局部工作中，完全是可能有缺点和错误的。这些缺点和错误自然是不利于文学艺术的发展和繁荣的，不利于作家和艺术家的个人的努力的。党曾经提出反对对资产阶级思想的投降，反对行政命令方式的领导和简单粗暴的批评，反对教条主义和修正主义，这都是针对文艺工作中的缺点和错误。我们不能说我们的方向正确，党的总的领导正确，文艺工作就没有必须改进之处。我们也不能说在文艺工作中就没有教条主义存在。理论和实际脱离就是教条主义。在某些理论批评中，在某些干部的头脑中，教条主义是存在的。但我们和右派分子和修正主义分子的争论在这里：党的指导思想是不是教条主义？刘绍棠等人说是；我们说绝不是。党一直是反对教条主义的。党在文艺方面的指导思想就是毛泽东同志在1942年提出的文学艺术要为劳动人民服务、作家和艺术家要学习马克思列宁主义，学习社会、要到人民群众中去取得原料，改造思想感情，以及解放后提出的发展和繁荣文学艺术的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策。这里面有什么教条主义？
    刘绍棠荒谬地说毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中有一个“策略性理论”部分，这个部分是根据抗日战争中的情况提出来的，全国解放后就过时了，不适用了，然而党仍然坚持这个“策略性理论”，这就是教条主义，这就是公式化概念化的根源。他所说的“策略性理论”有两个内容：一是“当时文艺为政治服务，就必然表现在为政策条文服务上”；二是“当时在提高和普及的问题上，是以普及为主”?。凡是读过毛泽东同志的讲话的人都会知道，在它里面根本找不到文艺必须为政策条文服务的话，这不过是刘绍棠的?造而已。毛泽东同志只说过，“党的文艺工作，在党的整个革命工作中的位置，是确定了的，摆好了的；是服从党在一定革命时期所规定的革命任务的。”这和为政策条文服务有什么相同之处？也许有人会说，毛泽东同志的讲话里虽然找不到刘绍棠?造的那样的话，但我们的文艺工作中却有过这样的事实：有些做宣传工作的同志常常要求文学艺术及时地宣传各种各样的政策，而且不分作家和艺术家也的确这样作过。如果为了战斗的需要，有时候作家和艺术家甚至要拿起枪来，他们在自愿和可能的条件下用文学艺术的形式来宣传党的政策，宣传那些和革命运动和人民生活的关系特别密切的重大政策，又有什么可非难呢？对他们的创作活动又有什么害处呢？只要做宣传工作的人和作家艺术家自己都不要有这种错误的看法，以为文学艺术的作用就止于此，以为文学艺术为政治服务就是这样狭隘，就没有什么问题了。再进一步说，即使曾经有过某些不了解文艺理论和创作规律的人，他们抱有这种错误的狭隘的见解，那也不过是局部的现象，一时的现象。他们的这种见解是并不能代表而且不符合党的指导思想的。至于普及和提高的问题，毛泽东同志曾经批评过有些同志对于普及的轻视和忽视，指出在当时的条件下，普及工作的任务更为迫切，并且对普及和提高的关系作了统一的辩证的说明。如果我们不把普及的含义理解得很狭隘，以为仅仅是指写通俗读物一类的事情，而把它理解为文艺应该适应广大的人民群众的需要和欣赏水平，文艺应该面向群众，应该普及到群众中去，那么普及的任务更迫切，这是长远适用的。这又有什么教条主义？这对作家和艺术家又有什么束缚和妨碍？
    刘绍棠还把社会主义现实主义的理论也叫作教条主义。现在已经十分明白了，刘绍棠、冯雪峰、秦兆阳这样一些人，他们对于今天世界上最先进的文学苏联文学的攻击，他们对于今天世界上最先进的文艺思潮社会主义现实主义的反对，都不过是欧美的资产阶级分子和修正主义者的可怜的应声虫而已。这倒的确不只是中国的情况，而是带世界性的情况。“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”，这正是他们的写照。刘绍棠在这里面扮演的是特别可笑的角色。他连“从现实的革命发展中真实地、历史地和具体地去描写现实”这样一句文字和含义本来十分明确的话都不能理解，毫无道理地说这就“不是首先要求作家以当前的生活真实为依据，不是忠实最现实的生活真实”。?好像不是把现实视为和描写为发展的变化的更真实，反而是把现实视为和描写为静止的不变的才更真实似的。刘绍棠毫不隐蔽地坚决反对文学艺术要用社会主义精神去教育人民。他说：“如果不把用社会主义思想教育人民抽开，就必然会产生概念化公式化，而忽视生活的复杂现象，必定会产生教条主义”?。原来在右派分子的眼睛里，社会主义思想就是教条主义！
    在反教条主义的问题上，我们和右派分子修正主义分子的根本分歧就在这里：我们反对的是真正的教条主义；他们反对的是党的领导，是马克思主义的原则和理论。他们把这些必要的正确的事物都一概诬蔑为教条主义，是为了便于进攻。我们说，在某些理论批评中，在某些干部的头脑中，是存在着教条主义的。这种教条主义对文艺工作会不会发生消极的影响呢？是会发生的。正因为如此，我们才不但反对文艺上的修正主义，也要反对文艺上的教条主义。不过应该说明，创作上的公式化概念化，教条主义不过是原因之一。公式化概念化可以来源于教条主义，也可以来源于作家艺术家缺乏生活，思想水平艺术水平不高，粗制滥造以及其他原因。以为教条主义的问题解决了，文学艺术的一切问题也就解决了，那也是不切实际的。
    对右派分子反对党领导文艺的共同公式，我们的驳斥就是如此。
    文艺界的右派分子和修正主义分子在反对党的领导、反对党的文艺思想的同时，还提出来了一些他们自己的主张。我们不妨也略为考察一下。考察一下那些主张，可以更加明确地看出，我们和他们之间的争论正是文艺的方向和道路问题，即到底是社会主义的方向和道路，还是资产阶级的方向和道路问题。吴祖光主张用什么来代替党的领导呢？他只能提出一个“个人奋斗”，再加一个“著书都为稻粱谋”?。这倒是一个简单明了的道道地地的资产阶级纲领。完全靠个人；而个人的奋斗又不过是为了金钱。刘绍棠的纲领表面上稍微复杂一点。他会讲一些“现实主义”、“生活的复杂现象”、“忠实于生活真实”之类的词句。但他用这些词句来提倡的实际的写作倾向也不过如我们已经说明过的，一个是要“揭示生活中的落后面”，“对阴暗面的描写”不能“保留着分寸”；一个是要写“曲线”，要写“性的刺激”，要写“黑狗钻裤裆”之类?。后者正是现在欧美资产阶级的堕落的文学的特色之一，用不着对它作什么评论。前者也不过是王实味、萧军、丁玲、罗烽这些人在延安提倡并实行过的所谓“暴露黑暗”的翻版，毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话已经对这种反动的主张作了严正的驳斥，已经从理论上透彻地解决了问题。值得注意的是这种早已破产的反动的主张现在又被不少右派分子和修正主义分子提出来了，带有相当的普遍性，并不只是刘绍棠一人。在解放以前一贯轻视人民、一贯强调人民的落后的冯雪峰，到了全国解放，而且已经进入社会主义社会以后，却大讲“人民的痛苦”，提倡“歌颂批判两个轮子共同前进”?。黄秋耘也提倡写“生活中的阴暗面”，写“人民的疾苦”。他说，“今天在我们的土地上，还有灾荒，还有失业，还有传染病在流行，还有官僚主义在肆虐，还有各种各样不愉快的事情和不合理的现象。”他把右派分子刘宾雁的刻划“阴暗面”的作品捧到和契诃夫的短篇小说一样高?。秦兆阳在“现实主义——广阔的道路”中反对“差不多”，提倡“新鲜的试探”，“大胆的独创性”，单就这些抽象的话还看不出他的真正的意图。等到我们知道他对于刘宾雁的作品和黄秋耘一样肉麻地捧场，在给刘宾雁的信上说什么“你在开辟一条自己的现实主义的新路，同时也在给别人作出榜样来”，并且向人夸耀他在编辑“人民文学”的时候敢于发表刘宾雁的以及其他类似的作品，我们就明白他的“新鲜的试探”和“大胆的独创性”到底是什么了。我们的文学艺术并不是不能描写我们工作中的缺点，并不是不应该批评我们生活中的消极和落后的事物。如果是站在正确的立场上，如果是以正确的态度来描写，完全是必要的。但这些右派分子和修正主义分子却非常奇怪，他们把今天的社会、今天的人民生活看成和过去的社会、过去的人民生活一样，看不见它们之间的根本的差异和已经发生了的根本的变化。我们的国家在各个方面的跃进和无数令人振奋的新气象在他们的心目中都好像不存在。他们提到“灾荒”、“失业”、“传染病”、“官僚主义”的时候，居然完全抹杀了我们对于这些现象所采取的种种积极有效的革命的措施，好像自然的灾害、流行的疾病和旧社会遗留下来的一切问题都成了新社会的罪状。如果说延安当时的所谓“暴露黑暗”是反革命分子和反党分子在革命遭到困难的时候的联合进攻，那么在建设社会主义的现在，这些新的“暴露黑暗”论者的反社会主义的意图也就昭然若揭了。
    在右派分子当中，还有在政治和艺术的关系问题上用强调艺术的手法来否定政治的重要，否定政治对于艺术家的重要，宣扬胡风集团的创作实践就可以改造思想的谬论，并醉心于资产阶级的艺术家的生活方式及其培养艺术家的方法的。陈涌就是这样。这显然同样是妄图把我们的文学艺术引向资产阶级的方向和道路。政治和艺术的关系也是一个我们和资产阶级分子长期争论的问题。在这个问题上，我们需要另外写文章来对右派加以驳斥。　　　　　　　　1958年1月29日
