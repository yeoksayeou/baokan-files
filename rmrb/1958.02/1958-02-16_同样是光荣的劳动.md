The Same is Honorable Labor

After reading the letter "Should I Resign and Return Home to Do Housework?", I recalled the life my wife and I have lived for more than ten years. If a woman resigns and returns home to do housework, will her husband look down on her? Let me talk about my views as a husband.

In the past, we both lived on a supply system in the revolutionary ranks, and we had one child at the time. My wife was not well-educated and was physically weak. Although she could do some work, it was relatively strenuous, and she could not give full play to her abilities. At that time, she did some administrative work in the office. Because life was difficult and we could not afford a nanny, she brought the child to work during the day, often taking care of work and neglecting the child. Later, as the number of children increased and her health deteriorated, and with more housework, it affected her work energy even more. When she gave birth to her second child, I had already switched to a salary system. Although there was no mobilization for her to return home at that time, she herself felt that she was taking the country's salary but not doing much work, and she felt very sorry. She was busy at home and outside, and it was not good for either side. Therefore, after we discussed it, with the approval of the leadership, she resigned and returned home.

After she resigned, she was a little unaccustomed to it at first. For example, she had fewer close comrades, and sometimes she felt lonely. Sometimes I said the wrong thing carelessly, and she suspected that I looked down on her for being backward. When we quarreled over some trivial matters, she would say, "Humph! Now I am eating your rice, you can say whatever you want!" In fact, I did not look down on her. Later, there were more children, more housework, and her health was even weaker. On the one hand, I took more time to help her with some work, and on the other hand, I comforted her spiritually. I realized that taking care of four children at home is not easy housework, and people who silently engage in this kind of labor are worthy of respect. Therefore, although my wife does not work, my love and respect for her have not changed in any way. On the contrary, because she can concentrate on taking care of the children and doing housework, our family is arranged in an orderly manner, the children are dressed neatly, and eating, clothing, and entertainment are all done very well. I feel very warm when I come home from work, and our relationship is getting better and better. She herself also feels very happy. We subscribed to some newspapers and magazines, and she can study on her own and help the children read and review their lessons in the evening. We all feel that life is very fulfilling.

According to my experience, in the new society, housework is also very necessary. If there are not many wives who are busy with housework at home, how can husbands work with peace of mind and complete various work tasks well? As the saying goes: You don't know the price of firewood and rice until you manage a household, and you don't know the kindness of your parents until you raise children. Anyone who doesn't do housework for a few days doesn't know the importance and honor of housework. Once my wife was sick for three or four days, I had to take leave to cook and take care of the children. However, I felt that everything was not handy, the food was not cooked well, the children could not be coaxed well, and the house was in a mess. This made me think of my wife's daily housework, which is so worthy of respect!

    同样是光荣的劳动
    看到“该不该退职回家从事家务劳动”的信以后，我回忆起了我们夫妻十多年的生活。妇女退职回家参加家务劳动，丈夫会不会看不起呢？我谈谈自己作为一个丈夫的人的看法。
    从前，我们都在革命队伍中过着供给制的生活，当时有一个孩子。我的妻子文化程度不高，身体衰弱，虽能作一些工作，但比较吃力，不能充分发挥作用。当时，她在机关中作一些事务工作，因为生活较苦，不能雇保姆，白天带着孩子工作，经常顾了工作就顾不了孩子。以后，孩子增多，身体也愈来愈坏，家务事多了，更影响工作的精力。当她生了第二个孩子的时候，我已经改为薪金制了。虽然那时候并没有动员她回家，但她自己感到拿国家的工资，做的工作不多，很过意不去，自己家里外边忙的够呛，对哪方面都没有好处。因此我们合计之后，经领导上批准，她就退职回家了。
    她退职以后，开始有些不习惯，比如接近的同志少了，有时感到寂寞。有时我不注意说错了话，她就怀疑我是不是嫌她落后。我俩为了一些小事吵嘴时，她就说：“哼！现在是吃你的饭了，你说怎的就怎的吧！”其实我并没有看不起她的意思。以后孩子更多了，家务事增加，她的身体也更弱了。我一方面更多地抽空帮助她干些活，一方面在精神上安慰她。我体会到她在家里看管四个孩子，这种家务劳动并不轻闲，默默无闻地从事这种劳动的人，是值得尊敬的。所以，我的妻子虽然不工作了，我对她的爱和尊敬并没有发生任何变化。相反的因为她能够专心一意照顾孩子，操作家务，我们的家庭安排得有条不紊，孩子收拾得利利索索，吃、穿、娱乐各方面都搞得很好，我下班回家感到很温暖，我们的感情愈来愈好了。她自己也感到很愉快。我们订了一些报纸、杂志，她自己可以学习，又能在晚上帮助孩子们读书温课，我们都感到生活过得很美满。
    根据我的体会，在新社会里，家务劳动，同样是非常需要的。假如没有很多妻子在家中操劳家务，做丈夫的怎么能安心工作很好地完成各种工作任务呢？俗话说：不当家不知柴米贵，不养儿不知父母恩。谁要是不干几天家务活，也不知道家务劳动的重要和光荣。有一次我的妻子病了三、四天，我只好请假做饭看孩子。可是，感到处处不随手，饭也做不好，孩子也哄不好，屋子里弄得乱七八糟。这使我想到妻子天天的家务劳动，是多么值得尊敬啊！
