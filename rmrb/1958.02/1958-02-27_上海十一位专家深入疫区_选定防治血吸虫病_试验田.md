Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 26th. Eleven Shanghai experts researching schistosomiasis have recently selected "experimental fields" and gone to schistosomiasis-stricken areas to conduct on-site research. These experts, after rectification, are full of enthusiasm and determined to change their past working methods that were divorced from reality, in order to better serve patients and production. Epidemiologists Mao Shoubai and Su Delong have decided to lead a group of researchers to Kunshan and Qingpu respectively to study prevention work. Yu Wei, director of the Shanghai Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Institute, went to Jiading during the Spring Festival. Yang Yi and Huang Mingxin, standing committee members of the Schistosomiasis Research Committee, are preparing to admit late-stage schistosomiasis patients in Kunshan and Qingpu. According to past regulations, schistosomiasis patients in the late stage were considered untreatable and were no longer admitted. They have now gained preliminary experience in treating late-stage patients in rural areas and have decided to conduct in-depth experiments locally, personally treating patients.

    上海十一位专家深入疫区
    选定防治血吸虫病“试验田”
    据新华社上海26日电　上海十一个研究血吸虫病的专家最近分别选定了“试验田”，到血吸虫病流行地区现场进行研究工作。这些专家经过整风，热情高涨，决心改变过去脱离实际的工作方法，更好地为病人服务，为生产服务。流行病学家毛守白、苏德隆决定分别带领一批研究人员到昆山、青浦去研究预防工作。上海市血吸虫病防治所所长郁维在春节期间就去了嘉定。血吸虫病研究委员会常务委员杨宜、黄铭新准备在昆山、青浦收治血吸虫病晚期病人。按照过去规定，血吸虫病人到了晚期，认为是无法治疗，也就不再收治的。他们现在已在农村取得治疗晚期病人初步经验，决定在当地进行深入的试验，亲自治疗病人。
