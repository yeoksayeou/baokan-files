Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd -- After inspecting and summarizing the situation of cadres sent down for labor training, the Party Group of the Ministry of Public Security proposed measures to further strengthen political and ideological education, requiring the cadres sent down for training to bloom the reddest flowers and bear the biggest fruits in terms of ideological gains.

From the end of January to the beginning of February, a comfort and inspection group from the Ministry of Public Security, headed by Vice Minister Wang Zhao, went deep into the villages of Hejian and Nanpi counties in Hebei Province, where the Ministry's cadres were sent down. They used methods such as individual conversations, symposiums, and door-to-door visits with landlords to inspect and summarize the situation of the cadres' training, and discovered many meaningful issues.

The inspection proved that among the 348 cadres sent down from the Ministry of Public Security to the countryside for training, more than 90% performed very well in the nearly two months. They have initially developed labor habits, feel interested in labor, and have made great achievements. Their common characteristics are: high morale, full of energy, and great determination. They can consciously eat and live with the masses, and do heavy work with the masses in the severe cold and snow. Their production efficiency is equivalent to that of the upper and middle-level labor force of agricultural cooperatives for more than 88% of them. The masses believe that their labor has four major characteristics: First, they do whatever they are asked to do; second, they have a high attendance rate and rush to do heavy work; third, they do not spare their strength and use as much strength as they have; fourth, they also pay attention to hygiene. According to incomplete statistics, 34 people have been selected as labor models or activists, 13 have been commended at members' meetings or Party and League meetings, and 155 have been elected and hired to serve as deputy directors of agricultural cooperatives, secretaries of Party and League branches, teachers in people's schools, health committee members, and work recorders.

After laboring, the political and ideological level of most of these cadres sent down has been greatly improved, and their attitude towards labor and the working people has changed from an emotional point of view. Many people said that they used to see or hear in books that the working people are great and that every grain of rice and every bowl of porridge is hard-won, but now they feel it from the bottom of their hearts. Those who doubted that there was nothing to learn in the countryside not long ago now deeply feel that the fine qualities of the working people can never be learned in a lifetime; those who used to cover their noses when they saw manure now regret not bringing a manure basket when they see manure on the road; some people used to make trouble about enjoyment and treatment, and were not convinced when they were criticized in the office, but now they unhesitatingly admit that they were wrong in the past. In their actual life in the countryside, they also deeply realized the people's love and support for the Party; through the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, they also had a vivid class education lesson. All this made them feel the wisdom and importance of the Party's policy of sending cadres down for labor training, and they were happy to have the opportunity to be sent down for training first. Some people said: "One month of labor training is better than reading ten years of books!"

However, according to the inspection, about 2% of the people still have serious resistance to labor training, mainly manifested as being afraid of hardship, disliking the dirtiness of the countryside, and being passive in labor. There are also some people who "follow the crowd." They are not clear enough about what to train for and how to train during the down time, and they simply think that it is to "suffer a little" and learn some production skills. They are reluctantly willing to work with the masses, but unwilling to eat and live together, and have no feelings for the peasants. In addition, some people do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of social work in addition to labor, and do not do enough.

The Party Group of the Ministry of Public Security analyzed the above situation and believed that the great achievements already made are only preliminary gains, which is a good start, and we must continue to work hard to solve the existing problems. To this end, corresponding measures have been proposed as specific goals for the future efforts of cadres sent down for training. First, we must further clarify the purpose of sending cadres down for training, and clarify the necessity and importance of sending cadres down for training in cultivating and improving cadres, strengthening ties with the working people, and strengthening the cadres' communist outlook on life; second, all cadres sent down for training must resolutely and unswervingly implement the principle of eating, living, and laboring together with the masses. The three are indispensable. Only by doing this can we easily appreciate the thoughts and feelings of the working people, learn from the working people, and transform and improve ourselves; third, in order to achieve the effect of comprehensive training, we must actively participate in the various socialist construction and socialist transformation movements that change the face of the countryside, and play an exemplary leading role. Everyone should also, in the capacity of a new member or activist, do one or several social work tasks in addition to labor, do everything they can to connect with reality, familiarize themselves with the masses, improve their ideological level, and train themselves.

### 开最红的花　结最大的果  公安部向下放干部提出三项要求  坚持同吃同住同劳动，便于改造与锻炼自己

    开最红的花　结最大的果
    公安部向下放干部提出三项要求
    坚持同吃同住同劳动，便于改造与锻炼自己
    新华社23日讯　中共公安部党组对下放劳动锻炼干部的情况进行了检查和总结之后，提出了进一步加强政治思想教育工作的措施，要求下放锻炼的干部在思想收获方面开最红的花，结最大的果。
    从1月底到2月初，公安部以副部长王昭为首的慰问检查团，曾深入到公安部下放干部所在地河北省河间、南皮两县的村庄，采用个别交谈、座谈会和逐户访问房东等方法，对下放干部锻炼的情况进行了检查和总结，发现了不少有意义的问题。
    检查证明，公安部下放到农村锻炼的三百四十八名干部，在近两个月的时间里，90％以上的人表现很好，他们初步养成了劳动习惯，对劳动感到了兴趣，做出很大成绩。他们的共同特点是：情绪高、劲头足、决心大，能够自觉地和群众同吃、同住，在风雪严寒中同群众一起干重活。他们的生产效率，有88％以上的人同农业社的上等和中等劳动力相当。群众认为他们劳动有四大特点：一、叫他们干啥就干啥；二、出勤率高，抢重活干；三、不惜力，有多少劲使多少劲；四、还讲卫生。据不完全统计，已有三十四人评选为劳动模范或积极分子，有十三人在社员大会或是党、团会议上受到表扬，被推选和聘请担任农业社副主任、党团支部书记、民校教员、卫生委员、记工员等职务的也有一百五十五人。
    这些下放干部经过劳动之后，绝大部分人的政治思想水平有了很大提高，对劳动和劳动人民的态度从思想感情上起了变化。许多人表示，过去在书本上看到或者听说劳动人民伟大，一粥一饭来之不易，如今才从心坎里得到感受。不久前还怀疑在农村没什么可学的人，如今也深深感到劳动人民的优良品质真是一辈子也学不完的；过去见粪掩鼻的人，如今见路上有粪就会后悔没有带来粪筐；有的人曾闹享受闹待遇，在机关受到批评时还不心服，如今毫不犹豫地承认过去自己错了。在农村实际生活当中，他们还深刻体会到人民对党的热爱和拥护；通过农村两条道路的斗争，还上了一堂生动的阶级教育课。这一切都使他们感到，党的下放劳动锻炼政策的英明和重要，对自己首先得到下放锻炼的机会而感到高兴。有人说：“下放锻炼一个月，胜过读十年书啊！”
    但是据检查，现在大约还有2％的人对劳动锻炼有较严重的抵触情绪，主要表现是怕吃苦，嫌农村脏，劳动消极。还有一些“随大流”的人，他们对下放锻炼什么，怎样锻炼，思想不够明确，只简单地认为是为了“吃吃苦”，学点生产技术，他们勉强愿意同群众同劳动，不愿意同吃同住，和农民还没有感情。此外有些人对于在劳动之余进行社会工作的重要性认识不足，做得不够。
    公安部党组研究分析了上述情况，认为已取得的很大成绩，还只不过是初步的收获，是一个良好的开端，必须继续努力，解决目前存在的问题。为此提出了相应的措施，作为下放锻炼干部今后努力的具体目标。第一、必须进一步明确下放锻炼的目的，明确下放锻炼对于培养提高干部，密切同劳动人民的联系，坚定干部的共产主义人生观的必要性和它的重要意义；第二、所有下放锻炼的干部必须坚决地毫不动摇地贯彻执行同群众同吃、同住、同劳动的原则，三者不可缺一，只有做到这一步，才便于体会劳动人民的思想感情，便于向劳动人民学习，便于改造与锻炼自己；第三、为了收到全面锻炼的效果，必须积极参加各项改变农村面貌的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的运动，并要起模范带头作用。每个人还要以新社员或者积极分子的身分，在劳动之余，尽自己所能做一项或几项社会工作，从多方面联系实际，熟悉群众，提高思想水平，锻炼自己。
