　　New, Continued, and Renovated Seventeen Pairs of Mines
    Shaanxi and Gansu Strive for Coal Self-Sufficiency
    Sichuan Restores and Develops Over 1,400 Small Coal Kilns
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Shaanxi and Gansu provinces' state-owned coal industry will fully develop this year with a leaping-forward attitude.

    In these two provinces, where coal production and demand are extremely unbalanced, seventeen pairs of coal mines will be newly built, continued, and renovated this year. Existing production mines will extract 2.28 million tons of coal. In addition, 2.9 billion tons of new coal resources will be surveyed and explored, in order to strive for self-sufficiency in coal production in these two provinces as soon as possible.

    In order to achieve the goals of more, faster, better, and more economical results, with the exception of the Wangshi'ao vertical shaft in the Tongchuan mining area, which will produce 1.2 million tons per year, the vast majority will be medium-sized and small mines.

    The designed production capacity of all the mines planned for construction this year reaches more than 6.3 million tons per year.

    In order to quickly clarify the distribution of coal resources in the Northwest and prepare new coal sources for the construction of new mining areas, large-scale general survey work will be carried out this year. New coal sources will be sought between Baishui and Pucheng in the Weibei coalfield, in the Qinling Mountains on both sides of the Baocheng Railway in southern Shaanxi, in Jingyuan and the Hexi Corridor in Gansu, and in the Haomi River Basin in Qinghai. In this year's exploration tasks, in addition to general power coal and civil coal, the focus will be on finding coking coal needed by the iron and steel industry.

    This newspaper reports: Sichuan Province restored and developed more than 1,400 small coal kilns last year, with an annual output of 500,000 tons. More than 1,200 of them were restored and mined by agricultural cooperatives.

    Sichuan Province is very rich in coal resources. According to preliminary statistics, there are coal resources in 104 counties throughout the province. After continuing to mine extensively in accordance with local conditions this year, it is estimated that the coal mined by agricultural cooperatives alone will reach 359,000 tons.

    Not long ago, the Sichuan Provincial Bureau of Mines and Metallurgy and the Coal Management Bureau specially organized working groups to go deep into various places to provide technical guidance. They will assist relevant departments in gradually converting the "one-eyed well" small coal kilns into two wellheads and install simple ventilation equipment to ensure safe production. (Ding Fan)

　　新建续建改建十七对矿井
    陕西甘肃争取煤炭自给
    四川恢复和发展一千四百多个小煤窑
    据新华社讯　陕西、甘肃两省国营煤炭工业今年将以跃进姿态全面发展。
    在这两个煤炭生产和需要极不平衡的省份，今年要新建、续建和改建十七对煤井，原有生产矿要开采二百二十八万吨煤炭。此外，还要普查和勘探二十九亿吨新煤源，以便争取早日使这两省煤炭生产自给。
    为了达到多、快、好、省的目的，除在铜川矿区兴建一对年产一百二十万吨的王石凹竖井以外，绝大多数都将建中型和小型的矿井。
    今年计划建设的全部矿井，设计生产能力年达六百三十多万吨。
    为了尽快的查清西北煤炭资源的分布情况，给新矿区建设准备新的煤源，今年将要展开大面积普查工作，并且在渭北煤田的白水和蒲城间、陕西南部宝成铁路两旁的秦岭一带、甘肃靖远和河西走廊和青海浩亹河流域寻找新煤源。今年的勘探任务中，除了一般动力用煤和民用煤以外，将着重寻找钢铁工业需要的焦煤。
    本报讯　四川省去年恢复和发展了一千四百多个小煤窑，年产量达五十万吨。其中由农业社恢复开采的有一千二百多个。
    四川省煤矿资源很丰富。据初步统计，全省有一百零四个县有煤源。今年继续因地制宜地大量开采以后，仅农业社开采的煤，预计即有三十五万九千吨。
    不久以前，四川省矿冶局和煤管局专门组织了工作组，深入各地进行技术指导。他们将协助有关部门把独眼井的小煤窑逐渐改为两个井口。并且安置简易通风设备，以便保证安全生产。　（丁帆）
