    Starting with the Characters in the Film "Nurse's Diary"
    Shi Zhen
    The film "Nurse's Diary" depicts the story of Jian Suhua, a graduate of a Shanghai nursing school, who goes to a remote construction site in Northeast China to participate in construction. To go where the motherland needs you, to go into the heat of the struggle, this is the supremely glorious and heroic act of China's younger generation, and also a test for every young intellectual. The film uses relatively vivid imagery to tell the story of such an ordinary young person, making people feel very close and interesting. The film focuses its greatest attention on the protagonist, Jian Suhua, and wants to let the audience know more about Jian's inner activities through writing a diary. This attempt and effort are good. I think the film "Nurse's Diary" has undeniable advantages and should be affirmed. But it cannot be denied that although the film proceeds very smoothly, the characters in the film give a relatively vague impression, and some even give a feeling of not being real enough.
    Take the relationship between Jian Suhua and her boyfriend, Shen Hao, for example, it is written too simply. Being greedy for enjoyment, selfish and conceited are the main characteristics of Shen Hao's personality, which should be revealed in the development of the plot. But if these characteristics are simply and stereotypically portrayed from the beginning, without giving other elements to this character's personality, that is to say, if this character is so clearly repulsive from the very beginning, the audience will naturally have a question: How could Jian Suhua fall in love with such a vulgar person? Before Jian Suhua left Shanghai, there was only one scene between Jian and Shen of going to see a house. The love between them and the occurrence of conflict were not accurately expressed in this scene, but simply indicated the difference between them. After Jian Suhua left Shanghai, the scenes between Jian and Shen were not well developed either. Shen Hao quickly became entangled with another girl, but all this did not bring any new difficulties to Jian Suhua. They still corresponded as usual: Shen still wanted Jian to return to Shanghai, and Jian refused to go back. After arriving at the construction site, Jian Suhua realized very early that Shen Hao was a person who "besides himself, plus his lover, children, and family, thinks nothing else is important," but she still loved him very sincerely, hoping that he would change. Faced with such a situation, Jian Suhua should have action and struggle, instead of always staying in the split state of rationally recognizing Shen Hao's shortsightedness and selfishness, while emotionally still loving him. Shen Hao's trip to the Northeast made Jian Suhua see with her own eyes that the distance between them was getting farther and farther, and finally they broke up. However, in the film, Jian Suhua's changes in thoughts and feelings towards Shen Hao still lack the necessary and definite expression in the image. What inner contradictions of Jian Suhua were revealed through Shen Hao's dramatic clue? What did she overcome? None of this is clear enough.
    Of course, what the audience cares about is Jian Suhua's situation after arriving at the construction site. Jian first meets Mo Jiabin and Gu Huiying when she arrives at the clinic. The clinic seems to be smoky and chaotic, dirty and messy, and the workers are unwilling to see a doctor. Coupled with one who is addicted to playing with women and one who is good at being jealous, all this is indeed terrible enough. It is not to say that these phenomena do not exist in real life, but how these phenomena are reflected in the film and how they are resolved. The film seems to give the impression that when Gu Huiying knows that Jian Suhua has another partner and has nothing to do with Mo Jiabin, Jian and Gu shake hands and make peace and unite to cure Mo Jiabin; although Mo is unwilling, the problems of the clinic seem to have been basically solved from then on. Such a hasty handling of the important dramatic conflicts after Jian Suhua arrived at the construction site is inappropriate. From the perspective of the characters, the personalities of Mo Jiabin and Gu Huiying are also expressed too simply. They are portrayed as too bad at the beginning, and then the ending is hastily concluded, giving people an unrealistic feeling. Coupled with the exaggerated and ugly acting methods of the actors, Mo and Gu are performed as a pair of clown-like characters, only amusing people in external actions, which makes these two characters even more superficial, giving people a false impression. Moreover, Jian Suhua was not deceived or played by such a stupid and annoying character as Mo Jiabin, which can only show that Jian Suhua is not too frivolous or too silly, and does not add any positive qualities to Jian. Therefore, this dramatic clue, which occupies a considerable amount of space, seems to be very difficult to reveal Jian's inner activities.
    In the film, the character of Gao Changping exists as an image in opposition to Shen Hao and Mo Jiabin. He is a lively and vigorous fighter on the construction site, he unconsciously gives Jian Suhua a very deep influence, and he is the character that Jian Suhua later truly yearns for. Therefore, the shaping of this character image is very important. The script provides an insufficiently vivid and full foundation for this character, but two scenes that were deleted are a pity. One scene is after Xiao Lu falls asleep, Gao Changping talks to Jian Suhua about how Xiao Lu's mother sacrificed, and patrols the construction site at night before going to bed, giving Jian a ride back; the other scene is when Jian Suhua goes down to the construction site and sees Gao Changping presiding over a telephone conference in the room. These two scenes themselves are not necessarily very perfect, but it is good to show the deep impression that Gao unconsciously left on Jian from these ordinary construction site lives. More should be sought from the contact of work and friendship for the deeper roots of the feelings between the two. Now Gao Changping seems to have been intentionally interested in Jian from the beginning, which is a bit sour and thin. Jian Suhua also seems to be looking forward to him, which makes it difficult to handle the drama between the two more deeply.
    The clues of the workers Lu Hao, Qian Huanzhang, and Hong Zhishou, who are second only to Gao Changping, also mostly slip away in laughter and laughter, without leaving a deeper impression on people. Jian Suhua is willing to go to the construction site to work, which is not surprising for this young man with ideals. But what does a new student from Shanghai like her feel when contacting the workers? What kind of impression and influence does it have on her? The film rarely touches on it, only the workers' warm welcome and encouragement to her, which is too simple in such an important place.
    Humor and fun are good things for a film, but if you over pursue fun and laughter, thus relaxing the correct handling of dramatic conflicts and the true depiction of character personalities, it will give the film the opposite effect. I think the film "Nurse's Diary" is not deeply touching, precisely because it has defects in these aspects.

### 从影片“护士日记”的人物谈起

    从影片“护士日记”的人物谈起
    石榛
    影片“护士日记”描述了上海护士学校毕业生简素华到东北某边远工地参加建设的故事。到祖国需要的地方去，到火热的斗争中去，这是我国青年一代无上光荣的、豪迈的行为，也是对每个知识青年的考验。影片用了较为生动的形象语言，讲述了这样一个普普通通的青年人的故事，使人感到十分亲切和有趣。影片以最大的注意力放在主人公简素华的身上，想通过写日记这个方式让观众更多地了解简的内心活动，这个尝试和努力是好的。我以为影片“护士日记”有不容忽视的优点，应该加以肯定。但也不可讳言，影片虽然进行得很顺畅，可是片中人物给人的印象却较为模糊，有的甚至还给人不够真实之感。
    以简素华和男友沈浩如的关系来说吧，就写得过于简单了些。贪图享乐、自私而且自负是沈浩如性格中主要的特点，应当在剧情的发展中揭示出来，但是如果从一开始便简单的、标签式的表现这些特点，而不在这个人物性格中赋予其他的因素，也就是说这个人物一开始便是那样一目了然的令人讨厌，观众会很自然的发生一个疑问：简素华怎么会爱上这样一个庸俗的人呢？在简素华离开上海之前，简、沈之间只有一场去看房子的戏，他们之间的爱情和冲突的发生在这场戏中没有得到确切的表现，只是简单的表明了他们之间的分野。简素华离开上海后，简、沈之间的戏也没有很好的展开，沈浩如很快便和另一个姑娘纠缠在一起，而这一切并没有给简素华带来了什么新的困难，他们之间照常通信：仍然是沈要简回上海，简不肯回去。到工地后的简素华很早便认识到沈浩如是个“除了自己，加上他爱人、小孩、家，别的什么都觉得不重要了”的人，但她仍然十分真挚的爱着他，希望他转变过来。面临这样的情形，简素华应该有行动、有斗争，而不是老停留在理性上认识了沈浩如目光如鼠只顾自己的毛病，而感情上又一直爱他的分裂状态之中。沈浩如东北之行使简素华亲眼看到他们之间越距越远，最后终于决裂了。但在影片中，简素华对沈浩如思想感情的变化在形象上仍感缺乏必要和确定的表现，通过沈浩如这条戏剧线索揭示了简素华的什么内心矛盾，她战胜了什么？克服了什么？都不够明确。
    当然，观众关心的还是简素华到工地以后的情形。简到医务站首先遇到莫家彬、顾惠英这两个人物。医务站显得乌烟瘴气，又脏又乱，工人都不愿意来看病，加上一个玩弄女性成性，一个好争风吃醋，这一切的确是够可怕的。并不是说在现实生活中没有这些现象，而是说这些现象在影片中如何体现出来和如何解决。影片仿佛给人这样的印象：当顾惠英知道简素华另有对象，与莫家彬无关时，简、顾便握手言欢，联合起来治莫家彬；莫虽不甘心，但医务站的问题似乎从此便已基本上得到了解决。这样草率的处理简素华到工地后的重要戏剧冲突是不妥当的。从人物来看，莫家彬和顾惠英的性格也表现得过于简单，开头把他们表现得太坏，后面又草草收兵，给人以不真实的感觉。加上演员夸张的、丑化的表演方法，把莫、顾表演成一对小丑型的人物，只在外部动作上逗人发笑，更使这两个人物沦于浮面，给人虚假的印象。而像莫家彬这样愚蠢而讨厌的人物，简素华没有受他的欺骗玩弄，只能说明简素华还不太轻浮，还不太傻，此外并不能增加简的什么正面特质。因此这条颇占篇幅的戏剧线索对于揭示简的内心活动似乎也很难为力。
    影片中高昌平这个人物是作为和沈浩如、莫家彬相对立的形象而存在着。他是工地上生龙活虎的战士，他在不知不觉中给予简素华很深的影响，他是后来简素华真正向往的人物，因此这个人物形象的塑造很重要。剧本对这个人物所提供的基础是不够生动、饱满的，但有两场戏被删节掉了很可惜。一场是小路睡后，高昌平向简素华谈起小路的母亲是怎样牺牲的，并在睡前夜巡工地，顺路送简回去的戏；另一场是简素华下工地时站在门口看见高昌平在屋里主持一个电话会议的情形。这两场戏本身并不一定很完美，但从这些平常的工地生活中，表现出高昌平无形中给简留下深刻的印象却是很好的。应该更多地从工作和友谊的接触中去寻找他们两人之间感情的较深厚的根源。现在高昌平似乎一开始便有意于简，不免有点酸溜溜的，显得很单薄，简素华似乎也在盼着他，这样很难把这两人之间的戏处理得更深一些。
    仅次于高昌平的工人陆豪、钱焕章、鸿志寿的线索也多半在嘻嘻哈哈的笑声中滑过去，没有给人留下较深的印象。简素华愿意下工地去工作，这对这位富有理想的年轻人来说是不足为怪的。但像她这样一个上海新来的学生，在和工人接触中会感到什么呢？给她什么样的印象和影响呢？影片几乎极少接触到，只是工人对她热情的欢迎和鼓励，这样重要的地方，未免写得过于简单了。
    幽默、有趣对一部影片来说是好的东西，但如果过分追求趣味和笑料，因而放松了戏剧冲突正确的处理和人物性格真实的描绘，那会给影片相反的效果，我以为影片“护士日记”感人不深，正是在这些方面有着缺陷。
