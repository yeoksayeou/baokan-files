　　Our newspaper reports that recently, cadres of the Brick Text Agricultural Cooperative in Hou'an Township, Anxi County, Fujian Province, launched a major debate on how to be good cadres, overcoming the unwillingness of some cadres to serve and enthusiastically throwing themselves into their work.

　　During the great blooming and contending campaign in the countryside last year, some cadres of the Brick Text Cooperative felt wronged after receiving certain criticisms and accusations from cooperative members, and did not properly accept the members' correct criticisms. Afterwards, they even considered switching jobs and not being cadres anymore, and even had doubts about the basic ideas of revolutionary cadres bearing hardship before enjoying benefits, and wholeheartedly serving the people. The township Party branch and the county Party committee's working group stationed in the township believed that this was a reflection of the decline of the revolutionary will of some cooperative cadres, and decided to convene a meeting of cadres above the level of production team leader to debate issues such as what constitutes a good cadre.

　　At the meeting, production team leader Xie Xing said, "Being a cadre involves many meetings, drains energy, and deprives one of sleep, with no benefits." Another production team leader, Xie Xiudong, immediately raised a different opinion, saying, "Since the cooperativization and production upsurge in 1956, the cooperative has been holding frequent meetings and grasping things tightly. The ideological problems of our cadres and members have been resolved in a timely manner, political awareness has been raised, and the enthusiasm for production has been great. We have achieved bumper harvests for two consecutive years. In 1955, the entire cooperative lacked more than 300,000 jin of grain, but in 1956 we achieved self-sufficiency, and in 1957 we had a surplus of more than 80,000 jin, changing the grain shortage situation that our ancestors could never change. Even if everyone's living standards have improved and the nation's socialist industrialization has been supported, what's wrong with us cadres attending more meetings and putting in more effort?"

　　At this time, production team leader Xie Mei expressed a new opinion. He said, "Although holding meetings is good for raising awareness, cadres must take the lead in everything, which means they will suffer losses themselves." Cooperative affairs committee member Xie Zhuanyou supported Xie Mei's opinion. He added, "Being a cooperative cadre means more missed work and fewer work points earned, clearly leading to losses." The debate at the meeting became even more heated. Xie Rongzhou disagreed, saying, "Being a cadre means taking the lead. Under the leadership of the Party, we are taking the lead in following the socialist road. For the benefit of everyone, suffering some losses doesn't matter. Besides, putting in effort to run the cooperative well increases production, and everyone benefits, including oneself."

　　At this point in the debate, a cadre named Xie Bi said, "While it is true that cadres should wholeheartedly serve the people, they are often subject to criticism from the masses, which is truly thankless." Before he could finish speaking, Xie Liushui immediately used facts to criticize his statement. He said, "The masses are fair, let alone things in the distant past, just looking at recent events, recently all the cadres, Party members, and Youth League members in the cooperative responded to the call of the Party branch, took the lead in building pigsties overnight, penning pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and promoted the construction of 600 pigsties by cooperative members, penning all 800 pigs in the cooperative to accumulate fertilizer. The members all praised them, saying that the Party members and Youth League members set a good example, which made everyone follow suit, these are truly good cadres." Xie Yinchou also added, "Cadres taking the lead actively is not for the sake of hearing other people's praise. As long as it is beneficial to the people, it should be done, and should not wait for people to praise before doing it." Then everyone also said, "With criticism from the masses, the work will be done better, and the cadres themselves will make progress. Some cadres engage in speculative business and take the capitalist road. Without criticism, they will go further and further astray." Xie Jiashan also said, "Sometimes we may be subjected to abuse by a few people, but we should not be afraid. Last month I exposed two people who were stealing sweet potatoes from the cooperative. They cursed me behind my back, but I am not afraid of these people's curses. We should fight against bad people and bad deeds. We cannot lower our heads after being hit by bad people."

　　After three nights of debate, all the cadres of the Brick Text Cooperative, those whose revolutionary will had declined, were reinvigorated.

    经过一场辩论　重新振作精神
    砖文农业社辩论怎样当个好干部效果显著
    本报讯　福建省安溪县后垵乡砖文农业社干部最近展开了一场怎样当好干部的大辩论，克服了部分干部不愿当干部的思想，精神奋发地投入到工作中去。
    去年农村大鸣大放时，砖文社有些干部受到社员某些批评和指责后，感到受了委曲，没有很好接受社员的正确批评。以后，竟想换班不当干部，甚至对革命干部吃苦在前、得利在后和全心全意为人民服务等基本思想也发生了动摇。乡党支部和县委驻乡工作组认为这是一部分社干部革命意志衰退的反映，决定召开生产小组长以上干部会议，就怎样才算一个好干部等问题进行辩论。
    会上，生产队长谢行说：“当干部开会多，损精神少睡眠，没有什么好处。”另一个生产队长谢秀东马上提出不同意见，他说：“1956年合作化和生产高潮以来，社内经常开会，抓得紧，我们干部和社员的思想问题及时解决，政治觉悟提高，生产劲头很大，这两年连续取得大丰收，1955年全社缺粮三十多万斤，1956年就做到自给，1957年已有余粮八万多斤，改变了我们祖先一直不能改变的缺粮面貌。既使大家改善了生活，又支援了国家社会主义工业化，我们当干部的多开些会，出些力气，有什么不好？”
    这时，生产队长谢美发表了新的意见。他说，“虽然开会提高认识好，但是干部事事要带头，自己就要吃亏。”社务委员谢转友支持谢美的意见。他补充说：“当社干部误工多，赚的工分少，明明是带头吃亏。”会上争论得更热烈了，谢荣周认为不对，他说：“做干部就要带头，我们是在党的领导下，做走社会主义的带头人，为了大家的利益，吃些亏也不要紧，何况出力把社办好，增加了生产，大家有份，自己也有份。”
    辩论到这里，有个名叫谢璧的干部说：“当干部固然应当全心全意为人民服务，但常受群众批评，真是吃力不讨好。”话声未落，谢流水立即用事实对他的说法加以批评。他说：“群众是会说公平话的，远的不说，单说近的，最近全社干部、党、团员响应党支部的号召，带头连夜盖猪栏，圈猪积肥，推动社员盖了六百个猪栏，把全社八百头猪都圈起积肥了，社员都称赞说，党团员带头做榜样，使得大家跟着干，这些真是好干部。”谢银丑还补充说，“当干部积极带头，并不是为了要听人家的赞扬。只要对人民有利的事，就应去做，不该等人称赞才去做。”接着大家还说，“有了群众的批评，工作才会做得更好，干部自己才会进步。有的干部自己搞投机生意，走资本主义道路，如果没有批评，他就会越走越错。”谢加善还说：“有时受到少数人的谩骂，我们也不要怕，我前月检举了两个偷挖社里番薯的人，他们在背后骂我，但我不怕这些人的乱骂，我们应该和坏人坏事作斗争。不能受坏人一打击，就低头。”
    砖文社全体干部经过三个晚上辩论后，革命意志衰退的人重新振作了起来。
