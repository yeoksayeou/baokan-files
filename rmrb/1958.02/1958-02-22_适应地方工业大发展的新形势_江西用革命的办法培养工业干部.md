    Adapting to the New Situation of Rapid Development of Local Industry
    Jiangxi Uses Revolutionary Methods to Train Industrial Cadres
    Cadres are transferred to factories and mines to work as workers, and existing enterprise cadres participate in physical labor, so that they can be both red and expert in a few years.
    Nanchang, February 21st (Our reporter Zhang Pei, Li Lianbin) reported: The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee's active cultivation of cadres needed for the rapid development of local industry with revolutionary spirit and methods is a remarkable new measure.
    Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee decided to increase the total output value of local industry in the province by 559% this year, leaping from 610 million yuan to 4.05 billion yuan. This is a great leap forward. More importantly, new modern industrial sectors such as steel, cement, chemical fertilizers, and man-made fibers will be established in the province within seven years. Jiangxi, whose industrial base has always been weak, will become an economically developed province with industry and agriculture advancing side by side in a few years. However, this new situation of great leap forward has also brought a series of major problems, among which the issue of cadres is a very important link. According to preliminary estimates, about 20,000 industrial cadres need to be added in seven years. How to train this large number of cadres, especially leading backbones? The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee believes that this need is large, multi-faceted, and the time is very pressing. Therefore, it is impossible to adopt the usual training methods, but must adopt new methods that adapt to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward. This is to immediately and systematically transfer a large number of cadres to factories and mines to work as workers, requiring each cadre to learn a skill. After a few years, a group of both red and expert industrial management cadres can be trained to enrich and equip the expanded and newly built factories and mines. The first step is to transfer 1,000 people. Last month, more than 50 cadres (including 10 county-level cadres) arrived at the Pingxiang Coal Mine to work as workers. The Provincial Party Committee is also preparing to continue to transfer cadres to coal mines to work as workers, in order to train cadres needed to adapt to the province's coal production which will develop to 9 million to 10 million tons.
    In addition, it is also planned to transfer 200 cadres to enterprises such as the Nanjing Yongli Chemical Plant and the Jilin Fertilizer Plant to work as workers, because there are no chemical industrial enterprises in Jiangxi Province to train cadres in this area.
    In addition to the above training methods, the Provincial Party Committee requires existing enterprise cadres to be both red and expert. It is decided that the general cadres of enterprises will adopt the method of "advanced cadres self-study classes" and take turns working as workers; leading cadres such as factory and mine directors and factory and mine party committee secretaries must participate in physical labor in factories and mines for three months each year. In this way, all cadres of existing factories and enterprises can learn a certain skill within a few years. At a recent meeting held by the Provincial Planning Commission, the reporter also heard Comrade Bai Dongcai, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, call on leading cadres above the level of director of the industrial and transportation departments to spend a certain amount of time each week learning technology at factories in Nanchang or attending technical schools. Comrade Bai Dongcai asked everyone to make their own technology learning plans within a week and submit them to the industrial department of the Provincial Party Committee for unified arrangement.

    适应地方工业大发展的新形势
    江西用革命的办法培养工业干部
    抽调干部到厂矿当工人，现有企业干部参加体力劳动，几年以后可以作到又红又专
    本报南昌21日电　记者张沛、李连斌报道：中共江西省委用革命的精神和革命的方法，积极培养地方工业大发展所需要的干部，是一件颇为引人注目的新措施。
    最近，江西省委决定把全省地方工业的总产值在今年以内提高559％，即从6.1亿元跃进到40.5亿元。这是一个飞跃。尤其重要的是，在七年内将陆续建立起钢铁、水泥、化学肥料、人造纤维等本省新的现代工业部门。工业基础一向薄弱的江西，几年以后，将成为工业和农业并驾齐驱的经济发达的省份。然而这种大跃进的新形势也带来了一系列的重大问题，其中很重要的一环是干部问题。根据初步估算，七年中需要增加工业干部两万名左右。怎样培养出这一大批干部，特别是领导骨干呢？江西省委认为：这种需要是大量的，多方面的，而时间又很紧迫，因此不能采取通常的培养方法，而必须采取适应大跃进的新形势的新方法。这就是立即有计划地抽调一大批干部到工厂矿山中去当工人，要求每个干部学会一门技术。经过几年以后就可培养出一批又红又专的工业管理干部，充实和配备到扩建和新建的厂矿中去。第一步计划抽调一千人。上月已经有五十多个干部（其中包括十名县级干部）到达萍乡煤矿当工人。省委还准备继续调干部到煤矿去当工人，以便培养出适应全省煤炭生产将发展到九百万到一千万吨所需要的干部。
    另外，最近还准备抽调二百干部到南京永利化学厂，吉林化肥厂等企业去当工人，因为江西省内没有化学工业企业可以来培养这方面的干部。
    除上述培养的方法外，省委要求现有企业干部也要做到又红又专。决定：企业的一般干部采取“高干自修班”的办法，轮流当工人；厂矿长和厂矿党委书记等领导干部每年要有三个月时间参加厂矿体力劳动。这样可以使现有工厂企业的所有干部，在几年内都能学会某一门技术。在省计划委员会最近召开的一次会议上，记者还听到省委书记处书记白栋材同志号召主管工业交通部门的厅、局长以上的领导干部，也每人每周抽出一定时间到南昌的工厂去学技术，或者参加技工学校的学习。白栋材同志要求大家在一周内做出自己的学技术的规划，交由省委工业部门统一安排。
