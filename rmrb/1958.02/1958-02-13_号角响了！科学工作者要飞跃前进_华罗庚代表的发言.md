The bugle sounds! Scientific workers must leap forward
Speech by Hua Luogeng

I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. I also wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's speech.

I am now prepared to briefly discuss some of my recent feelings.

A vigorous and prosperous new atmosphere has emerged on all fronts across the country. The Party is solemnly calling on our scientific workers: Strive for a great leap forward in industry and agriculture, and catch up with the world's advanced levels in major scientific and technological sectors in a short period of time. This is a heroic and forward-looking call.

Excitement, joy, encouragement—none of these words can accurately express our current mood, which is also the mood shared by the people of the whole country. From an international perspective, the Soviet Union's two satellites have gone into space, and the communist parties of more than sixty countries held a meeting in Moscow, correctly declaring the arrival of a new era, a turning point in the era of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind has arrived. Domestically, there are countless initiatives: On the Yangtze River, a bridge spans the river, and the natural barrier since ancient times has become a thoroughfare; the Shu Road, which was difficult to ascend to the sky, is now where the Qin Mountains bow their heads and the Jiange Mountains make way, and one can travel comfortably; more than 80 million laborers are working across the mountains and plains, participating in farmland water conservancy construction. Taking Anhui Province as an example, the earthwork completed in an extremely short period of time, if arranged into a dike one meter high and one meter wide, its length would be more than six hundred times our proud Great Wall; the industrial front is also remarkable, with an average of one new major factory or mine completed every forty-six hours. Thousands of workers have broken through the original planned targets again and again, advancing bravely step by step. In a word, a vigorous and prosperous new atmosphere has emerged on all fronts across the country.

What is even more exciting is that we have also heard the Party's solemn call, the voice of the Party: In industry, strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in the next fifteen years or a little longer; in agriculture, strive for a great leap forward, a great harvest, and realize the National Agricultural Development Program 40 Articles (Revised Draft) as soon as possible; in science and technology, strive to approach or reach the world's advanced level in urgently needed sectors in a not too long time. This is a heroic and forward-looking call; this is a call full of encouraging power. Today, as we celebrate our glorious achievements, the Party has further pointed out to us an even more glorious tomorrow. It is absolutely true that the Party is our guiding light, and on the basis of the current victory, it has shown us another victorious and higher peak.

With sufficient funding and good conditions, scientific workers are no longer in a state of "heroes having no place to display their talents" but rather "how can they serve the people more effectively."

As a scientific worker, it is particularly glorious and fortunate to be born in this colorful era. Let's look at the requirements before us: In industry, we have reached the point where we can design and build some large-scale and technically complex projects ourselves. Science is needed to make progress quickly, well, and economically, and scientific support is needed to keep up with the rapid changes in technology and not lag behind the world level. In agriculture, a technological revolution is about to take place, which of course requires the support of science. National defense goes without saying. Due to the development of science, national defense weapons are being innovated with each passing day.

Therefore, for scientific workers, today is no longer the situation of "heroes having no place to display their talents" before liberation, but rather the time of "how can we serve the people more effectively," and the situation where knowledge is lacking and insufficient to meet the needs of the motherland. We can also see from the national budget the Party and government's concern and importance attached to scientific undertakings. In the 1957 scientific budget, we only used 89%, which is the most generous project in all national expenditures. But the 1958 budget not only did not decrease, but also increased by 30%, which is the project with the largest increase in proportion of all expenditures. These figures are ironclad evidence that the Party and government's concern and expectations for science are extremely ardent. Not only that, the Chinese Scientific and Technological Delegation to the Soviet Union, headed by Guo Lao, signed the agreement between the Chinese and Soviet governments on jointly conducting and the Soviet Union assisting China in major scientific and technological research, which includes 122 major projects. This is such encouraging good news for the scientific community. The Party and government have given us ample funding, and through Sino-Soviet cooperation, they have opened up conditions for us to improve rapidly. Under such care, we must boost our energy and strive for the top. On the other hand, we must always pay attention to the fact that having ample funding does not mean that we can relax our adherence to the principle of frugality in the slightest; having Soviet assistance does not mean that we can rely on the Soviet Union and neglect our own efforts. On the contrary, we should further understand the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and run science better, faster, better, and more economically, and more actively study our professions, and expand our close ties with relevant production and construction units as much as possible, so as to continuously support the objective requirements of industrial and agricultural technological reform with research results.

Only scientific workers who are both Red and expert can undertake the major tasks of the era. Scientists from the old society should acquire healthy souls and set an example so that young people do not mistakenly believe that "expert first, then Red" or "expert but not Red" is also acceptable.

The Party's care for scientific workers goes far beyond what has been said above. More importantly, more fundamentally, it is still concerned about the souls of scientific workers at all times. In the struggle against bourgeois rightists, in the rectification movement, scientific workers have received profound education, gained training, recognized the great significance of the struggle between the two roads, recognized the shame of living in a socialist society with ugly bourgeois thoughts, and recognized the great truth that "if the skin does not exist, what will the hair attach to." After the anti-Rightist struggle, the rightists were completely isolated, the middle ground also turned to the left, and they united with the progressive leftists, and walked on the socialist road with more confidence and more strength.

When we think about the fact that industry and agriculture are both leaping forward, and when we think about the responsibilities of scientific workers, we will immediately realize that only scientific workers who are both Red and expert can undertake the major tasks of this era. But it is embarrassing to say that most of us scientists who came from the old society are not from "both Red and expert" backgrounds. Therefore, our objective existence also makes young people mistakenly believe that the road of "expert first, then Red" or "expert but not Red" is feasible, so our self-transformation is not only to make ourselves acquire healthy souls, but also to eliminate the possibility of setting a bad example for young people.

Of course, ideological transformation is not an easy task. We have lived in the old society for a long time and have been deeply infected. As long as we are slightly lax, we will relapse. But we still have full confidence, because we now have all the positive factors conducive to transformation. We have the correct and great leadership of the Party. Due to the Party's constant education, we have a criterion for right and wrong, good and evil, and we constantly obtain the power to correct mistakes from it. The "skin" of capitalist society no longer exists. As "hair," as long as we are not willing to be "gentlemen on the beam," we will certainly attach ourselves to the "skin" of socialism. Of course, the greater the determination, the faster and more firmly it will be attached. On the other hand, each of us has the experience of two societies in the style of "Liu Jiemei." Looking at today and comparing it with the past, we will have unparalleled centripetal force towards the Party and will unswervingly take the socialist road. Of course, we should not relax our own subjective efforts in the slightest, discard our airs, and humbly learn from workers and peasants, and transform ourselves thoroughly.

Facing the high tide of socialist construction and the many demands before us, scientific workers should feel particularly honored and happy and boost their energy.

In short, the bugle has sounded! Workers and peasants are leaping forward, and all the conditions for scientific workers to leap forward are also in place. The Party has given us ideological weapons, has prepared material conditions for us, and has obtained the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. Now is the time for us to catch up quickly and meet head-on, respond to the Party's call, and now is the time for us to boldly join the ranks of working-class intellectuals. To repeat, we are determined to transform ourselves, transform ourselves into intellectuals with a proletarian worldview and outlook on life, and play a role, even if it is very meager, in this vigorous socialist construction through our profession.

    号角响了！科学工作者要飞跃前进
    华罗庚代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告，我也衷心拥护周恩来总理的讲话。
    我现在准备在这儿简单地谈一谈我最近的一些感受。
    全国各个战线都出现了蓬蓬勃勃兴隆旺盛的新气象。党在庄严地号召我们科学工作者：争取工业和农业大跃进，主要的科学技术部门短期内赶上世界水平，这是豪迈无前的号召。
    兴奋、高兴、鼓舞，这一切的字眼都不能够确切地表达我们当前的心情，这种心情也正是全国人民所共有的心情。从国际来看，苏联的两个卫星上了天，六十几国的共产党在莫斯科举行了会议，正确地宣布了新时代的到来，东风压倒西风的时代转折点的已经到来。在国内更是举不胜举的创举：长江上，一桥飞架，自古天堑变成了通途大道；难于上青天的蜀道，而今也是秦岭低头，剑阁让路，可以安卧而过了；八千多万劳动力漫山遍野地工作着，参加农田水利建设，就以安徽一省来说，在一极短期间所完成的土方工程如果把它排成为一公尺高一公尺宽的长堤，它的长度将为我们向所骄傲的万里长城六百多倍；在工业战线上也了不得，平均每四十六小时就将有一个新的重大的工厂或矿山建设完成。千百万职工，一而再，再而三地突破原订的计划指标，节节高，步步升地奋勇前进。总的一句话，在全国范围内各个战线上都出现了蓬蓬勃勃兴隆旺盛的新气象。
    更兴奋的是我们还听到了党的庄严号召，党的声音：工业方面，争取在今后十五年或者稍多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国；农业方面，争取大跃进，大丰收，尽早提前实现全国农业发展纲要四十条（修正草案）；在科学技术方面，争取在不太长的时间内，在急需的部门接近或者达到世界先进水平。这是豪迈无前的号召，这是充满了鼓舞力量的号召。在我们庆贺获得辉煌成就的今天，党进一步给我们指出了更辉煌的明天。千真万确，党是我们的指路明灯，在当前的胜利基础上又使我们看到另一个胜利的更高的峰顶。
    经费足，条件好，科学工作者再不是“英雄无用武之地”，而是“怎样才能够更有效地为人民服务”。
    作为一个科学工作者来说，生在这个丰富多彩的时代里也是特别感觉到光荣的，幸福的。且看摆在我们面前的要求：工业方面，我们已经达到了可以自己设计和建设一些大型的、技术比较复杂的工程的时候了，为了进行得快多好省需要科学，为了技术的日新月异不落后于世界水平需要科学的支援。农业方面，将要进行技术革命，这当然也是少不了科学的支援。国防更不用说，由于科学的发展，国防武器正在日新月异地花样翻新。
    所以对科学工作者说来，今天已经完全不是解放前的“英雄无用武之地”的情况了，而是“怎样才能够更有效地为人民服务”的时候了，而是知识缺乏不足以适应祖国需要的情况了。再从国家预算中也可以体会出党和政府对科学事业的关怀和重视，一九五七年度的科学预算，我们只用了百分之八十九，这是国家支出所有的项目中最宽裕的项目。但一九五八年的预算不但没有减少，而且又增加了百分之三十，这又是所有支出项目中增加得比例数字最大的项目。这些数字是铁的证据说明了党和政府对科学的关怀和期望是无比殷切的。不但如此，以郭老为首的访苏科学技术代表团与苏联签定了中苏两国政府关于共同进行和苏联帮助中国进行重大科学技术研究的议定书，其中，包括了一百二十二个重大项目。这又是科学界多么令人鼓舞的好消息。党和政府给了我们十分充裕的经费，又经过中苏合作给我们开辟了迅速提高的条件。在这样的关怀下，我们一定要鼓起干劲，力争上游。另一方面我们必须时刻注意，有了宽裕的经费，并不意味着我们可以对节约原则有丝毫的放松；有了苏联的援助，并不意味着我们可以依赖苏联，怠忽了自己的努力。与此相反，我们更应当体会党中央和毛主席的指示，更多更快更好更省地办好科学事业，更主动地钻研业务，尽可能扩大同有关生产、建设单位的密切联系，做到不断地以研究成果支援工农业技术改革的客观要求。
    不是又红又专的科学工作者就担当不了时代重大任务，从旧社会来的科学家们应使自己获得健康的灵魂，做出榜样，不使青年们误认为“先专后红”或“专而不红”也行得通。
    党对科学工作者的关怀还远不止以上所说的，更重要的，更基本的是它还时刻关怀着科学工作者的灵魂。在反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争中，在整风运动中，科学工作者们获得了深刻的教育，获得了锻炼，认识到两条道路斗争的重大意义，认识到生活在社会主义社会而带着资产阶级丑恶思想的羞耻，认识到“皮之不存，毛将焉附”的大道理。在反右斗争之后，右派分子完全孤立了，中间的也向左转了，和进步的左派团结一起，更有信心地更坚强地走在社会主义道路之上了。
    在我们想到，工农业都在突飞猛进的时候，在想到科学工作者的责任的时候，我们立刻就会体会到不是又红又专的科学工作者是不能够担当起这个时代的重大任务的。但是说来惭愧，我们这些从旧社会来的科学家们绝大部分都不是从“又红又专”出身的。因之，我们的客观存在也就使青年们误认为“先专后红”或“专而不红”的道路是行得通的，所以我们的自我改造不但是使我们自己获得健康的灵魂，而且另一方面可以杜绝了给青年们做坏榜样的可能性。
    当然思想改造并不是一件轻而易举的事，我们在旧社会中生活得很久了，感染得极深了，只要稍许懈怠，便会故态复萌。但是我们还是有十分信心的，因为我们现在具备了一切有利于改造的积极因素。我们有了正确的伟大的党的领导，由于党的经常教育，我们对是非善恶有了准绳，并且不断地从它那儿获得纠正错误的动力。资本主义社会的“皮”已经不存在了，作为“毛”来说只要不甘心做“梁上君子”，我们一定会附着到社会主义的“皮”上来的。当然决心愈大，附着得也就愈快愈牢。另一方面，我们每一个人都有“刘介梅”式的两个社会的经历，看看今天，比比过去，我们就会对党发生无比的向心力，就会毫不动摇地走社会主义道路。当然我们也不应当丝毫放松我们自己的主观努力，丢掉架子，去尽骄气，低首下心，全心全意地向工农学习，脱胎换骨地改造自己。
    面临着如火如荼的社会主义建设高潮和摆在面前的许多要求，科学工作者应特别感到光荣幸福，鼓起干劲。
    总之，号角响了！工人农民都在飞跃着前进，对科学工作者来说，飞跃前进的条件也都一切具备了。党已经给了我们思想武器，已经给我们准备好了物质条件，并且已经取得了苏联的无私援助，现在是我们急起直追，迎头赶上的时候了，响应党的号召，现在正是我们豪迈地走上工人阶级知识分子的队伍的时候了。再重复一句，我们有决心改造自己，把自己改造成为具有无产阶级世界观和人生观的知识分子，通过我们的专业在这如火如荼的社会主义建设中起一个应起的那怕是十分微薄的作用。
