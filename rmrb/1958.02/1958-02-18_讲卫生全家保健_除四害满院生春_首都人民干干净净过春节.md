    Emphasize Hygiene for Family Health / Eliminate the Four Pests and the Courtyard is Full of Spring
    The People of the Capital Spend a Clean Spring Festival
    (Our Newspaper) This Spring Festival, the people of the capital truly emphasized hygiene for family health, eliminated the four pests, and filled their courtyards with spring. Every household has clean windows and bright furniture. Some families have New Year paper cuttings pasted on the windows and fresh flowers in the room, making them especially clean and beautiful. People are neatly dressed, full of energy, and welcome the New Year with joy. Many streets and courtyards in the city have been cleaned and sprinkled with water, creating a fresh atmosphere everywhere.
    From February 1st to 16th, a major campaign to eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene was carried out throughout the city before the Spring Festival. Many areas and units have eliminated the "four pests" and achieved "three cleans" and "six bright surfaces." People can see signs such as "The four pests have been eliminated, inspection welcome" and "Four-free, Three-clean Courtyard" posted at the entrances of many agencies, shops, and residences on the streets. After inspecting 1,057 households in the Nan Chang Street residential area, no four pests were found, and there were no rat holes, rat infestations, rat traces, or sparrow nests. The Houzhai No. 5 on Beichang Street, a large courtyard with more than 50 households, also achieved "four-free," "three-clean," and "six bright surfaces." After inspecting more than 238,000 households in the six urban districts, nearly 90% achieved cleanliness both indoors and outdoors and on the streets. Only 37 households were found with mosquitoes and flies.
    During the pre-Spring Festival campaign, the people of the capital, regardless of age or gender, all participated. Every household "moved all the furniture" and carried out a thorough cleaning again, and also blocked rat holes and sparrow nests. Zhang, a 69-year-old woman from Ya'er Hutong in the Xisi District, had already done five major cleanings, and did the sixth one during this campaign. Two vice ministers of the Ministry of Communications took the lead in cleaning the agency's dormitory. More than 660 cadres from the University of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Health and other units cleaned the streets and cleared more than 20 truckloads of garbage. The Shawo Township in the Haidian District has blocked all the sparrow nests and rat holes in the entire township. Since the 11th, the Fengtai District has had a commando team of more than 300 people every day from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. to clear garbage and fill potholes. More than 2,000 students organized by the Dongsi District Committee of the Communist Youth League participated in mutual aid teams and helped 612 households without labor to do major cleaning. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing also helped residents block sparrow nests on the city walls and catch rats and sparrows.

    讲卫生全家保健　除四害满院生春
    首都人民干干净净过春节
    本报讯　今年春节，首都人民真正作到了讲卫生全家保健，除四害满院生春。家家户户窗明几净。有的人家窗上贴着迎春的剪纸，室内摆着鲜花，格外清洁美丽。人们穿得整整齐齐，精神饱满，喜气迎人。全市许多街巷和院落，都打扫干净，还泼了清水，到处一片清新。
    从2月1日到16日在全市开展了春节前除四害、讲卫生的大突击。许多地区和单位消除了“四害”做到了“三洁”“六面光”。人们在大街小巷都可以看到许多机关、商店、住户的门口，贴着“四害已除，欢迎检查”“四无三洁院”的字样。南长街居民区经过检查的一千零五十七户居民，都没有发现四害，没有鼠洞、鼠害、鼠迹和雀窝。北长街后宅五号是五十多户的大杂院，也全部做到“四无”“三洁”“六面光”。在城区六个区经过检查的二十三万八千多户，做到室内外和街道清洁的近90％。发现蚊、蝇的只有三十七户。
    首都人民在春节前大突击时，不分男女老幼齐动手，家家户户“家具大搬家”，再次进行了彻底大扫除，还堵塞了鼠洞和雀窝。西四区鸦儿胡同六十九岁的张老太太已经五次大扫除，在这次大突击中又做了第六次。交通部两位副部长带头打扫了机关宿舍。对外贸易学院、卫生部等单位的六百六十多干部打扫了街道，清除了垃圾二十多卡车。海淀区沙窝乡已将全乡的雀窝和鼠洞全部堵塞。丰台区从11日以来，每天早七点到九点都有三百多人的突击队，清除垃圾，填垫坑洼。共青团东四区委领导的两千多名学生参加的互助队，帮助六百一十二户没有劳动力的住户做了大扫除。中国人民解放军驻京部队，还帮助居民堵塞城墙上的雀窝，捕打鼠、雀。
