Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th: The headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers held a grand rally this afternoon to warmly support the joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments.

At 5 p.m., the rally began amidst the majestic battle song of the Volunteers. High above the venue hung two huge banners, the left one reading: "The three thousand li of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea will surely be completely unified," and the right one reading: "The 600 million working people of China will forever fully support it," with a horizontal banner reading: "Support the joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments and strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea."

Liang Biye, Deputy Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteers, spoke at the meeting. He said that since the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on February 5, 1958, proposing the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and various proposals for the peaceful reunification of Korea, our government issued a statement on February 7, 1958, supporting the Korean government's proposal and expressing its willingness to consult with the Korean government on the issue of the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. These two statements by the Chinese and Korean governments have been fully approved and supported by the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. During their visit to Korea, the Chinese government delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai received our army's generals and officers at the Volunteer Army Headquarters on February 17 and 18, and solicited their opinions on the withdrawal of the Volunteers from Korea. All the generals and officer representatives of the entire army fully agreed with the proposal of our government to the Chinese People's Volunteers to voluntarily withdraw completely from Korea, and decided to withdraw from Korea in batches before the end of 1958, with the first batch to be completed before April 30. The joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments on February 19, 1958, has officially announced this decision of our army. Our army headquarters also announced this decision in a statement on February 20. The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army warmly support these statements and earnestly and conscientiously implement this decision.

Comrade Liang Biye elaborated in detail to the officers and soldiers present on the content of the joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments and the statement of the Volunteer Army Headquarters, and put forward requirements to the broad masses of officers and soldiers on the "issue of boosting revolutionary enthusiasm and doing a good job in the withdrawal." Comrade Liang Biye said that when the Volunteer Army withdraws from Korea, it must achieve "good handover" (that is, doing a good job in the handover of defense), "good departure" (that is, doing a good job in all matters that should be done in the process of withdrawal), and "good arrival" (that is, doing a good job in all work after returning to the country); it must "not be impetuous or slack" to achieve "a good beginning and a good end" and "the army withdraws, friendship lasts forever."

Wang Tong, a second-class meritorious person of the Volunteer Army Headquarters, then spoke. He said that our voluntary withdrawal from Korea is a manifestation of the strength of the socialist camp and the strength of world peace forces. Now we are about to return to our country. We have deep feelings for the Korean people and army, and for every mountain and river in Korea. The blood of our heroes flows on the land of Korea, and our martyrs are buried in the land of Korea. We will not forget all this. If the American aggressors regard our voluntary withdrawal as a sign of weakness and think there is an opportunity to take advantage, then they will inevitably suffer a more shameful defeat.

Huang Jishu, the younger brother of the special-class hero Huang Jiguang and the squad leader of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, said excitedly: In 1955, my mother sent me to the Volunteer Army to inherit my brother's unfinished cause, oppose aggression, and defend peace. Now, in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and ease the tense situation in the Far East, I wholeheartedly support the withdrawal of the Volunteer Army from Korea. I guarantee here that no matter when, if the American aggressors dare to launch a war in Korea again, when necessary, I will resolutely learn from the heroic spirit of my brother Jiguang, return to the Korean front, and spare no effort to strike at the aggressors.

Shen Guangying, a lieutenant and political instructor of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, who was awarded the Third Class National Flag Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for helping the Korean people in reconstruction after the armistice, said at the meeting that we have always loved peace. In this period before we leave Korea, we will better assist the Korean people in peaceful construction and do more good things for the Korean people.

At 7:45, the meeting ended in slogans such as "Support the joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments" and "American aggressors get out of South Korea."

    朝鲜三千里山河一定能够统一  中国六万万人民永远全力支援
    志愿军总部集会拥护中朝两国政府声明
    新华社平壤20日电　中国人民志愿军总部今天下午召开大会，热烈拥护中朝两国政府联合声明。
    下午五时，大会在雄壮的志愿军战歌声中开始。会场上高悬着两联巨幅标语，左联是：“朝鲜三千里锦绣山河，一定能完全统一”，右联是：“中国六万万劳动人民，将永远全力支援”，横标是“拥护中朝两国政府联合声明，为争取朝鲜和平统一而奋斗”。
    中国人民志愿军副政治委员梁必业中将在会上讲话。他说，自从1958年2月5日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发表声明，提出立即从南北朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和实现朝鲜和平统一的各项建议后，我国政府即在1958年2月7日发表声明支持朝鲜政府的建议并表示准备就中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜问题同朝鲜政府进行磋商。中朝两国政府的这两个声明，得到了中国人民志愿军官兵的完全赞成和支持。以周恩来总理为首的我国政府代表团在访问朝鲜期间，于2月17、18日到我们志愿军总部接见了我军的将领和军官，就志愿军撤出朝鲜问题征询了意见，全体将领和军官代表全军完全赞同我国政府向中国人民志愿军提出的主动从朝鲜全部撤出的建议，决定于1958年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜，第一批将于4月30日前撤完。朝中两国政府1958年2月19日的联合声明已经正式宣布了我军的这一决定。我军总部也在2月20日的声明中，宣布了这一决定。志愿军广大官兵热烈地拥护这些声明，并认真切实地执行这一决定。
    梁必业中将向到会官兵详细阐述了中朝两国政府联合声明和志愿军总部声明的内容，并就“鼓起革命干劲，作好撤军工作问题”向广大官兵提出了要求。梁必业中将说，志愿军在撤出朝鲜之际，要作到“交好”（即作好防务的交代）“走好”（即作好撤出过程中所应做的一切事项）“到好”（即作好到国内后的一切工作）；必须“不躁不懈”作到“善始善终”以及“军队撤出，友谊长存”。
    志愿军总部二等功臣王统接着讲话。他说，我们主动撤出朝鲜是社会主义阵营力量强大的表现，是世界和平力量强大的表现。现在我们即将回国了，我们同朝鲜人民和军队，同朝鲜一山一水都有着深厚的感情，我们英雄的血流在朝鲜国土上，我们的烈士埋在朝鲜的土地上，这一切我们都不会忘记。如果美国侵略者把我们主动撤出看作示弱的表现，以为有机可乘，那么，它们必然会遭到更可耻的失败。
    特级英雄黄继光烈士的弟弟、志愿军某部班长黄继恕激动地说：1955年，妈妈将我送到志愿军部队，继承哥哥的未竟事业，反对侵略，保卫和平。现在为了和平解决朝鲜问题，为了缓和远东紧张局势，我衷心地拥护志愿军撤出朝鲜。我在这里保证：不论什么时候，如果美国侵略者胆敢在朝鲜重新发动战争，必要的时候，我一定坚决学习继光哥哥的英勇精神，重返朝鲜前线，不惜自己的一切力量，打击侵略者。
    停战后，在帮助朝鲜人民进行恢复建设中、荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国三级国旗勋章的志愿军某部政治指导员沈光英中尉在大会上说，我们从来是热爱和平的。我们在撤离朝鲜以前这一段时间内，将更好地协助朝鲜人民和平建设，为朝鲜人民做更多的好事。
    七点四十五分，大会在拥护“中朝两国政府联合声明”、“美国侵略者滚出南朝鲜”等口号声中结束。
