Promoting the Virtue of Self-Love and Love for Others
    ——A Visit to a Group of People in Wulaocun, Nanjing, Who Love Labor and Emphasize Hygiene
    Our reporters　Zhen Weimin　Shi Yue'e
    We visited Wulaocun in Nanjing City on the eve of the New Year, where residents were engaged in the annual major cleanup campaign.
    On the Xixiang Road bathed in sunlight, walked those diligent and homeland-loving residents. Some were discussing the "appetite" of rats, some were using straws to catch mosquitoes and flies in the corners of their stoves, some were washing clothes, and some were sweeping the streets, scrubbing the floors until they shone. Everyone loves cleanliness, and every household emphasizes hygiene has become a reality here. Since 1953, we have visited Wulaocun several times, and each visit has given us the same impression: the virtue of self-love and love for others among the Chinese people is fully manifested here. Although the people here are not high in economic income or cultural level, it should be said that they are all cultured, moral, and scientifically literate people.
    She Loves Her Home So Much
    During our visit to Wulaocun, the first acquaintance we met was Feng Guizhen. People always like to call her a "rat-catching expert." Three years ago, she contributed to eliminating the rat infestation in Wulaocun. In recent years, the residents of Wulaocun can leave rice jars uncovered and food on the table overnight. This is inseparable from her efforts.
    Last October, during the winter patriotic health campaign, Feng Guizhen was still an activist. She visited the residents of the ninth group in the village door-to-door and indeed found problems: Rats were discovered in the rat-free village. In some homes, the rice bags were gnawed through by rats again. Therefore, Feng Guizhen visited each household, studied the movements of rats with them, helped them set rat traps, and placed the traps where rats were active. The next morning, she went to each house to ask, and indeed caught two rats.
    Feng Guizhen was not satisfied with these achievements. She thought, why only two families caught rats after setting dozens of traps? She had heard some housewives say superstitious things: "Feng Guizhen, the more actively you run around, the less you will catch. Rats are very clever. When they hear you are going to catch them, won't they quickly escape?" But she did not believe this statement. She and the residents studied what kind of food the rats in Wulaocun liked to eat. They successively tried many foods such as pot scraps, fried dough sticks, sesame balls, and chicken heads as bait, and the results proved that the rats here like to eat fresh food with a greasy taste. They used this food to lure the rats, and they have caught more than ninety rats in the past two months. The people of Wulaocun praised Feng Guizhen's work. We asked her why she has been able to persist as an activist in the patriotic health movement for several years. She said: "In 1952, we carried out patriotic health here to prevent and eliminate the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. Now, doing a good job in hygiene and eliminating the four pests is to support the realization of the forty articles in the countryside. My hometown is in Lixiahe in northern Jiangsu. Before liberation, it was a miserable place where there were floods every year. Our family fled famine from northern Jiangsu to Jiangnan to work. Now, the Party is leading the transformation of the countryside and changing the face of Lixiahe. As a worker's family member from the rural areas of northern Jiangsu, how can I not be active? Some people say: Doing hygiene is about formality and superficiality. I say that doing hygiene and eliminating the four pests is truly Chairman Mao seeing through our hearts and is the greatest good thing for us to prolong our lives. Take my family as an example. Before liberation, someone in the family was always sick throughout the year. Look, now very few people get sick. How can we not do hygiene? Besides, doing hygiene has also become our habit. We housewives cannot be considered doing housework if we do not do hygiene."
    Why Did a Lazy Man Become a Model Householder?
    Speaking of personal hygiene and environmental sanitation, Huang Wenqing, deputy director of the residents' committee, accompanied us to the home of Cao Hefeng, a "five-good" activist. At this time, Cao Hefeng was busy with housework beside the coal stove. He is a 56-year-old man. Before liberation, Cao Hefeng was a lazy man who wouldn't even pick up an overturned oil bottle. In 1952, Nanjing City launched a vigorous patriotic health campaign, and Cao Hefeng's wife, Li Yuehua, became an activist in the patriotic health movement in the village. However, Cao Hefeng often complained and wanted his wife to carry the child to attend residents' meetings.
    The result of the patriotic health movement fundamentally changed the natural appearance of Wulaocun. Near Feijia Vegetable Garden behind his house, the stinking pond that accounted for three-quarters of the village's area was turned into a wide road, and large buildings were built. Dead cats, rotten dogs, dead children, flies, mosquitoes, and diseases were gone. With the help of the state, the whole village had electric lights, tap water, kindergartens, and elementary schools. The "Distressed Village" became the "Happy Village." These facts deeply moved the old man's heart. He made up his mind to spend his old age in this happy village with national honor. At this time, the local government, based on Li Yuehua's active performance and their family's situation, introduced her to work in the paper mill. Old Cao excitedly said to his wife: "The government cares about us so much! You go to work with peace of mind. I will take care of everything at home." From then on, Cao Hefeng began to learn to cook, wash clothes, mend pants, take care of children, and clean inside and outside. Old Cao not only cared about the cleanliness and hygiene of his home but also cared about the cleanliness and hygiene of the surrounding neighbors. In front of his house, separated by an open ditch, was the Ningwu Railway. He was the first to think of a way to dig out all the sludge in the open ditch and keep the rainwater flowing smoothly. The stones under the rails were also dug out twice a year to remove the accumulated sludge and then pile them up. In this way, it not only improved environmental hygiene but also protected the roadbed. Since then, Cao Hefeng has become an activist in the clean and hygienic movement. We have been guests at Cao's house three times in the past three years. Although Cao's house has only one room, the interior is bright, clean, and spotless from the floor to the ceiling. Huang Wenqing told us that we always check the homes of activists first when we inspect hygiene. The inspectors wear white gloves and check the tops of cabinets and windows, and also go under the table to check. If there is any dust, it must be cleaned again. Old Cao's house has never caused us any trouble.
    Self-Love and Love for Others Are Not Contradictory
    Perhaps some people will ask: The people here do not have abundant economic income. Will doing hygiene hinder their production and affect their income? Will it be an extra burden for them? No, doing hygiene is for everyone's benefit, and it is precisely for their own benefit. In the eyes of working people, there is no contradiction between self-love and love for others. Ling Yun and Fang Yongchang both proved this principle to us.
    One evening, we visited Fang Yongchang, a bachelor who goes out early and returns late. Fang Yongchang's house is very small but tidied up in an orderly manner. We asked him: "You go out early and return late every day. Isn't it too much trouble to keep your house so clean?" His answer was simple: "How can it not be tidy? Just the firewood under this bed can fill this small room. Where would I live?"
    Fang Yongchang is a street barber. He carries his burden on the street from morning to night, giving haircuts to working people. Fang Yongchang's barber burden business is particularly good. Most of the working people in the village get their hair cut by him. In the Confucius Temple area, old customers keep calling him, and new customers are willing to have him cut their hair as soon as they hear he is from Wulaocun. Fang Yongchang disinfects his razor and scissors with alcohol every time he gives someone a haircut. We asked Fang Yongchang why it is difficult for ordinary barber shops to disinfect once per haircut, but why does he do this? Fang Yongchang, who was wiping his barber tools with alcohol, smiled and asked us: "Can I deceive customers with the title of Wulaocun hygiene model? A few days ago, I was carrying my burden home from the Confucius Temple when someone on the road wanted me to cut his hair. Because I ran out of alcohol and the tools were not disinfected, I did not agree to cut his hair. I would rather do less business than let others get skin diseases."
    When we went to Ling Yun's house, we happened to run into Ling Yun's family eating dinner. Two adults and three children were all skillfully using serving chopsticks. Perhaps many people would think that using serving chopsticks is a troublesome thing. If there are several dishes on the table and seven or eight people eating, wouldn't it become a world of dancing chopsticks? We asked him whether using serving chopsticks was convenient or not? Ling Yun's answer was: "Using serving chopsticks is more convenient than not using serving chopsticks. We usually only have one or two dishes for a meal. Using serving chopsticks to pick up a dish and put it on the head of the bowl, you can eat half a bowl of rice. If you don't use serving chopsticks, everyone's chopsticks are forking around in the dish, that's more troublesome!" Ling Yun told us that he is the hygiene first-aid worker in Wulaocun. After he learned hygiene common sense in the lecture class held in the village in 1953, he felt that it was not very hygienic for everyone's chopsticks to be stained with rice crumbs when eating, so he began to adopt the serving chopsticks system and has persisted to this day. Now the whole family, even the smallest child, has developed the habit of using serving chopsticks. The serving chopsticks system has brought happiness to their whole family. Last spring, the influenza epidemic in Nanjing City was very serious. His eldest child once had a cold at school, but they insisted on isolation and used serving chopsticks, and the cold did not spread to other people.
    Deep in the Hearts of Children
    The sanitation movement in Wulaocun has changed the village's natural appearance and also changed people's ideological outlook. This village's in-depth and sustained sanitation movement over the past five years has left a deep impression in people's minds. Many vivid reflections can also be found in the hearts of children in the Wulaocun kindergarten.
    The Wulaocun kindergarten now has more than 130 children. Early in the morning, when the children come to the kindergarten, they have to let the nanny check their hands and compare each other to see whose hands are the cleanest. Whether in the kindergarten or at home, the children can avoid spitting everywhere and wash their hands before meals or after using the toilet. Every Saturday, the nanny asks: "Children, what do you do when you go home on Sunday?" The children always answer: "Take a bath," "Wash hair," "Change clothes," "Cut nails." One Sunday, the grandmother of Wang Shanning, a child in the senior class, did not wash his hair for him. The next day, Wang Shanning dragged his grandmother to the kindergarten and insisted that she say to the nanny in person: I guarantee to wash my grandson's hair tomorrow.
    This semester, a new nanny came to the kindergarten. The new nanny took care of the children for the first time during lunch. The nanny said: "Children, let's eat." The children looked at the new nanny with strange eyes. The nanny asked: "Why don't you eat?" The children then answered in unison: "It's not hygienic to eat without washing hands." Everyone happily ate only after washing their hands. The children were all eating, but Chen Tianyun, a little girl in the junior class, pouted and did not move her chopsticks. The new nanny asked: "Tianyun, are you not feeling well?" She shook her head. Asked again: "Is the dish not good?" Tianyun shook her head again. The nanny asked again: "Then why don't you eat?" The little girl shyly said: "This is someone else's bowl, I don't eat."
    These children implement the hygiene system so seriously. The kindergarten has few toilets, and the nanny mobilizes the children who live near the kindergarten to go home to defecate. One morning, little friend Xue Caixi was in a hurry to urinate. He rushed home, only to see the door locked. His mother had gone to the street to buy groceries. Anxiously, he squatted on the ground and cried. Zhang Bingnan, a pedicab worker who lived nearby, walked past here and asked him why he was crying. The child said: "I want to urinate, and the door at home is locked." The pedicab worker said: "Then what are you crying for? Just pee on the ground, silly child!" Xue Caixi shook his head and said: "The nanny said that good children do not urinate or defecate everywhere." The pedicab worker was moved and ashamed after hearing this, and later he also became an activist in the sanitation movement among the pedicab workers.
    We are engaged in a cause that our predecessors dared not dream of. This great cause has left such a deep impact in the hearts of the next generation of children! The future achievements will be immeasurable. The patriotic health movement is currently unfolding across the country with the force of a strong wind breaking through thousands of miles of waves. It guides people to carry forward the virtue of self-love and love for others in the motherland, and promotes people to promote the growth of a new powerful country with modern industry, agriculture, and scientific culture.

    发扬了自爱爱人的美德
    ——访南京市五老村一群爱劳动讲卫生的人们
    本报记者　甄为民　史越峨
    我们在新年前夕访问了南京市内的五老村，那里的居民正在进行一年一度的大清扫运动。
    在阳光照耀下的新巷马路上，走着那些勤劳而热爱家乡的居民，有的人在讨论着老鼠的“食欲”，有的人在灶角用吸管吸捕蚊蝇，有的在浆洗衣裳，有的在扫清街道，把地板拖洗得发白发光。人人爱清洁，户户讲卫生在这里已经变为事实。1953年以来，我们曾几次访问五老村，几次访问都给我们这样的印象：我国人民自爱爱人的美德，在这里得到充分的发扬。虽然这里的人们经济收入、文化水平都不算高，然而应该说：他们都是些有文化、讲道德、懂科学的人们。
    她是这样的热爱家园
    在访问五老村的时候，我们碰到的第一个熟人是冯桂珍。人们总喜欢说她是“捕鼠能手”。三年前，她曾为消灭五老村的鼠患贡献过力量。几年来，五老村的居民可以把米坛子不加盖，饭菜摆在桌上过夜。这是和她的一份努力分不开的。
    去年10月，开展冬季爱国卫生运动中，冯桂珍仍然是一个积极分子。她挨家挨户地访问了本村第九组的居民，果然发现了问题：无鼠村发现了老鼠。有的人家，米袋又被老鼠咬穿了。于是，冯桂珍就到每家串门子，挨家研究老鼠出没的动向，帮助人家上好鼠夹，把鼠夹放在有老鼠动静的地方，第二天一早，她又跑到各家去问，果然打到了两只老鼠。
    冯桂珍并不满足于这点成绩，她想，上了几十家的鼠夹，为什么只有两家打到老鼠呢？她曾经听到一些家庭妇女说迷信话：“冯桂珍，你越跑得凶越捉不到，老鼠最灵巧，听到你要捉它，它还不赶快逃生吗？”可是她并不相信这种说法，她和居民们研究五老村的老鼠爱吃什么东西。她们先后试用锅巴、油条、麻团、鸡头等许多食物做诱饵，结果证明这里的老鼠最喜欢吃有油腥味儿的新鲜食物。她们就用这种食物引诱老鼠，最近两个月内已经捕捉到九十多只老鼠。五老村的人们称赞冯桂珍的工作，我们问她，几年来为什么能坚持当爱国卫生运动的积极分子，她说：“1952年我们这里搞爱国卫生，是为了防止和消灭美帝国主义细菌战，现在搞好卫生除四害是支援农村实现四十条，我的家乡就在苏北里下河，解放前那是块年年有水灾的苦地方，我们一家就是在苏北不能生活才逃荒到江南来做工的，现在党领导要改造农村，改变里下河的面貌，作为一个从苏北农村来的工人家属，我能不积极吗？有人说：搞卫生是讲形式、图表面，我说搞卫生、除四害真是毛主席看透了我们的心，要我们人民延年益寿的最大的好事情。就拿我家说，解放前，一家老小一年到头总有人生病，你看，现在就很少有人生病了，怎么能不搞卫生呢？再说，搞卫生也成了我们的习惯，我们做家务活的不搞卫生就不能算是家务活了。”
    懒汉为什么成了持家模范
    谈起个人卫生和环境卫生，居民委员会副主任黄文卿陪我们到了“五好”积极分子曹鹤峰的家里。这时曹鹤峰正在煤炉旁操持家务。他是一个五十六岁的老汉。解放以前，曹鹤峰是一个油瓶倒了都不扶的懒人。1952年，南京市开展了轰轰烈烈的爱国卫生运动，曹鹤峰的爱人李月华成了本村爱国卫生运动中的积极分子，可是曹鹤峰还常发牢骚，要老婆背着孩子去开居民会。
    爱国卫生运动的结果，根本改变了五老村的自然面貌。在他屋后的费家菜园附近，占全村四分之三面积的臭水坑，变成了大马路，盖起了大楼房。死猫、烂狗、死孩子、苍蝇、蚊子和疾病都没有了。在国家帮助下，全村有了电灯、自来水、幼儿园和小学。“苦恼村”变成了“欢乐村”。这些事实，深深地激动了这个老人的心，他打定了主意，要在这个有全国荣誉的欢乐村度过他的晚年。这时，地方政府根据李月华的积极表现，和他们家庭的情况，介绍她到纸坊工作。老曹激动地对老婆说：“政府太关心我们了！你安心工作去吧，家里的一切事情，都由我来管。”从此，曹鹤峰才开始学着烧饭、做菜、洗衣、补裤、带孩子、打扫内外。老曹不仅关心家里的清洁卫生，还关心周围邻居的清洁卫生。他家门前隔一条明沟就是宁芜铁路，是他第一个想办法把明沟里的污泥全部挖光，经常保持雨水畅通，路轨下的石子，每年也要扒出两次，铲去积存的污泥，然后再堆好，这样，既改善了环境卫生，又保护了路基。从此曹鹤峰成了一个清洁卫生运动中的积极分子。我们三年来三次到曹家作客，曹家的住屋虽然只有一间，但室内明窗净几，从地板到天花板，几乎一尘不染，黄文卿告诉我们说：我们检查卫生，都是先检查积极分子家的。检查的人戴着白手套，检查橱顶和窗子，还到桌子底下去查看，如果发现有一点灰尘就得重搞。老曹家里是从来没有叫我们费心的。
    自爱爱人没有矛盾
    也许有人会问：这里的人们经济收入并不宽裕，搞卫生会妨碍他们的生产，影响他们的收入吧？会是他们的额外负担吧？不，搞卫生是为了大家的利益，也正是为了自己的利益，在劳动人民看来，自爱爱人之间并没有矛盾。凌云和方永昌都向我们证明了这样一条道理。
    一天傍晚，我们访问了早出晚归的单身汉方永昌。方永昌的房子很小，却整理得有条有理。我们问他：“你每天早出晚归，家里收拾得这样干净，不太麻烦吗？”他的回答是质朴的：“不整齐怎么行？光是这床底下的劈柴，就能堆满这间小屋子，那叫我住在那里呢？”
    方永昌是一个街头理发师。他从早到晚挑着担子，在街上给劳动人民理发。方永昌的理发挑子生意特别好。本村大部分劳动人民是由他理发的。在夫子庙一带，老主顾叫个不停，新主顾一听说是五老村来的，都愿意让他理发。方永昌给人理一次发，剃刀、剪刀都要用酒精消一次毒。我们问方永昌，一般理发店都很难做到理一次发消一次毒，你为什么要这样做呢？正在用酒精擦洗理发工具的方永昌，面露笑容反问我们说：“我能拿着五老村卫生模范的招牌去欺骗顾客吗？前几天，我从夫子庙挑着担子回家，路上有人要我理发，因为我的酒精用完了，工具没有消毒，我就没有答应给他理。我宁可少做生意，也不能让别人染上皮肤病。”
    我们到凌云家里去的时候，正碰上凌云一家人吃晚饭。两个大人和三个孩子都很熟练地使用着公筷。也许有不少人会觉得，使用公筷真是一件麻烦事，一桌有几个菜，七八个人吃饭，那不成了筷子飞舞的世界了吗，我们问他使用公筷方便不方便？凌云的回答是：“使用公筷比不使用公筷要方便，我们吃一顿饭一般只有一、两个菜，用公筷挟一次菜，摆在碗头上，就可以吃半碗饭，要是不用公筷，大家的筷子在菜碗里叉来叉去，那才麻烦呢！”凌云告诉我们，他是五老村的卫生急救员，1953年，他在本村举办的讲习班上学了卫生常识之后，就觉得吃饭时，各人筷子上的饭屑沾来沾去不大卫生，就开始采用公筷制，一直坚持到今天，现在一家人，连最小的孩子都养成了使用公筷的习惯。公筷制给他们全家带来了幸福。去年春天，南京市全城的流行性感冒十分严重，他的大孩子，一度在学校里传来了感冒，可是他们坚持了隔离，使用公筷，感冒就没有传染给其他人。
    在孩子们的心灵深处
    五老村的卫生运动改变了村里的自然面貌，也改变了人们的思想面貌。这个村五年来深入持久的卫生运动，在人们的头脑中留下的深刻的印象，在五老村幼儿园孩子们的心灵中，也可以找到许多生动的反映。
    五老村幼儿园现在有一百三十多孩子。一清早，孩子们来到幼儿园，都要让阿姨检查双手，还要互相比比，谁的手最干净。不论在园内还是在家里，孩子们都能做到不随地吐痰，饭前或便后洗手。每逢星期六，阿姨就问：“小朋友，星期天回家做什么？”孩子们总是这样回答：“洗澡”、“洗头”、“换衣服”、“剪指甲”。有一个星期天，大班小朋友王善宁的奶奶没有替他洗头，第二天，王善宁就拖着他的奶奶到幼儿园来，一定要她当面对阿姨说：明天保证给孙儿洗头。
    这一学期，幼儿园来了一位新阿姨。新阿姨第一次值班照顾孩子吃中饭，阿姨说：“小朋友，吃饭罢。”小朋友们以奇异的眼光打量着新阿姨，阿姨问：“你们怎么不吃啊？”孩子们这才齐声回答说：“不洗手吃饭不卫生。”一直等到洗好了手，大家才高高兴兴地用饭了。孩子们都在用饭，可是，小班的小姑娘陈天云却撅着嘴，不动筷子，新阿姨问：“天云，不舒服？”她摇摇头。又问：“菜不好吗？”天云又摇摇头。阿姨又问：“那么你为什么不吃呢？”小姑娘羞羞答答地说：“这是人家的饭碗，我不吃。”
    这些小朋友对于卫生制度，执行得是那样的认真。幼儿园的马桶少，阿姨动员离家近的小朋友回家大、小便。一天上午，薛才喜小朋友急着要小便，奔回家去，只见家里的门锁着，他的妈妈上街买菜去了。急得他蹲在地上直哭。住在附近的三轮车工人张炳南走过这里，问他哭什么，小朋友说：“要小便，家里门锁了。”三轮车工人说：“那哭什么，就撒在地上好了，傻孩子！”薛才喜摇摇头说：“阿姨说过，好孩子是不随地大小便的。”这个三轮车工人听了又感动又惭愧，以后他也成了在三轮车工人中搞卫生运动的积极分子。
    我们正在从事前人所不敢梦想的事业，这一伟大的事业，又在下一代孩子们的心灵深处留下了多么深刻的影响！未来的成就，更将是不可估量的。爱国卫生运动目前正在全国乘长风破万里浪地展开，它引导着人们把祖国的自爱爱人的美德，更加发扬光大，推动着人们去促进崭新的具有现代工业、农业和科学文化的强国的成长。
