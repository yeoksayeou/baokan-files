　　New Theories on Nuclear Weapons
　　In order to justify the Western countries' refusal to establish a nuclear weapon-free zone in Central Europe, the Associated Press and the London "Times" suddenly published a clever argument: nuclear weapons include not only atomic and hydrogen bombs, but also rockets, airplanes, and artillery, because these tools are necessary to send the bombs to their destination. They say that establishing a nuclear weapon-free zone would mean simultaneously eliminating airplanes and artillery, so this suggestion is technically unfeasible. What a fresh argument!
　　According to the absurd logic of the Associated Press and the "Times," the problem of banning nuclear weapons is actually also the problem of banning conventional armaments. By analogy, all kinds of weapons are made of materials such as steel, and banning any weapons should also ban steel production. Therefore, the issue of disarmament is fundamentally impossible to discuss.
　　Complicating simple issues is a common tactic used by Western countries to obstruct the achievement of international agreements. However, it is surprising to see such clumsy sophistry as the Associated Press and the "Times" calling a deer a horse.

    核武器新论
    为了给西方国家拒绝建立中欧无原子武器区的立场辩解，美联社和伦敦“泰晤士报”忽然发表一种妙论：原子核武器不仅包括原子弹和氢弹，而且包括火箭、飞机和大炮，因为必须用这些工具才能把炸弹送向目的地。它们说，建立无原子武器区，就意味着同时取消飞机和大炮，因此这个建议在技术上行不通。好新鲜的论点！
    按照美联社和“泰晤士报”的荒谬逻辑，禁止核武器问题实际上也就是禁止常规军备问题了。以此类推，各种武器都要用钢铁等物质制成，禁止任何武器，也就应该禁止钢铁生产，因此，裁军问题根本是不能谈的。
    把简单的问题复杂化，这是西方国家阻挠达成国际协议的惯用手法。不过，像美联社和“泰晤士报”这样拙劣的指鹿为马，倒是令人吃惊的。
