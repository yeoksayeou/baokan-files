Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 2nd—The two converters in the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 created a new national record on January 30th by refining 180 heats of steel, surpassing their previous record of 164 heats by 16 heats.

　　For more than a month, the converter steelworkers have been highly motivated to catch up with Britain, and this reached its peak on the 30th. On that day, the workers of the C shift proposed the slogan "Create a new record" as soon as they started work. The cooperation between the workers in each link was as if they were one person. The iron smelting workers supplied the molten iron to the converters in a timely manner, and the time for each pouring of molten iron was reduced from 50 seconds to about 20 seconds. As a result, the workers of the C shift created a new record by refining 61 heats of steel in eight hours. Then, the workers of the A shift put forward the slogan of surpassing the C shift and quickly caught up. They broke the record set by the C shift eight hours earlier with a new record of refining 63 heats of steel in eight hours. Throughout the day, the three shifts of workers refined a total of 180 heats of steel.

　　The workers had already completed the January steel production plan two days ahead of schedule on the 29th. By this point, this nationally renowned converter workshop has overfulfilled its steel refining plan for 41 consecutive months.

　　The day before yesterday, the workers put forward a heroic slogan: by December 1962, they will have achieved 100 consecutive months of fulfilling the plan every month. They also guarantee that this year they will increase steel production by 30,000 tons more than planned.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 1st—The workers of Chongqing Steel Company have excellently completed the January production plan. According to the company's calculations, the total output value of steel and steel products in January exceeded the plan by 10% to 15% respectively, and the output of pig iron exceeded 3%; the quality of the products also exceeded the national requirements.

　　In the first month of this year, new records of Chongqing Steel Company emerged one after another, creating a vibrant scene. On January 28th, No. 2 open hearth furnace in the small steelmaking workshop created a new national record for the furnace age of similar open hearth furnaces with the achievement of refining 600 heats of steel; then, No. 1 open hearth furnace also caught up with 600 heats yesterday morning. Now, these two open hearth furnaces are still moving towards a higher level. The good news from the small steelmaking workshop had just spread, and yesterday the No. 3 open hearth furnace in the large steelmaking workshop created the highest record in the workshop's three years of operation with an achievement of 300 heats. The company's various departments had just finished sending good news to the small steelmaking workshop and quickly congratulated the workers of the large steelmaking workshop. In the competition to learn from the national advanced level, the small rolling mill workshop created 27 new production records this month. The actual output of the small rolling mill workshop and the iron smelting workshop in January reached a level that had never been seen before.

　　Now, the company's employees have set off a huge wave of finding advanced elements and catching up with them. Their irrepressible enthusiasm has forced the company leaders to revise the annual major production indicators determined by the company four or five times, each time higher than the last; until now, the entire company's annual plan has not been finalized.

　　上海钢铁一厂转炉车间创全国新纪录
    一天吹炼一百八十炉钢
    重庆钢铁公司超额完成一月份生产计划
    本报特约新华社上海2日电  上海第一钢铁厂转炉车间的两座转炉，在1月30日创造了吹炼一百八十炉钢的全国新纪录，这比他们过去创造的一百六十四炉新纪录高出十六炉。
    一个多月来，转炉炼钢工人赶上英国的劲头一直很大，30日这天更是达到了最高峰。当天，丙班工人一上班就提出“要创造新纪录”的口号。各个环节的工人配合得简直像一个人一样。化铁炉工人及时地把火红的铁水供给了转炉，每次倒铁水的时间由过去的五十秒钟缩短到二十秒钟左右。结果，丙班工人以八小时吹炼六十一炉钢创造了新纪录。接着，甲班工人提出了超过丙班的口号，急起直追。以八小时吹炼六十三炉钢的新纪录冲破了丙班在八小时前才创造的纪录。全天，三班工人总共吹炼出一百八十炉钢。
    工人们已经在29日提前两天完成了一月份的钢产量计划。到此，这个全国著名的转炉车间已经连续四十一个月月月超额完成炼钢计划了。
    前天，工人们又提出了一个英雄的口号：到1962年12月的时候，要达到连续一百个月都月月完成计划。他们还保证今年就要比计划增产三万吨钢。
    本报特约新华社重庆1日电  重庆钢铁公司职工出色地完成了1月份生产计划。根据公司计算，1月份钢和钢材生产总值分别超过计划10％到15％，生铁产量超过3％；产品质量也超过了国家的要求。
    在今年头一个月，重庆钢铁公司的新纪录一个紧跟着一个地不断出现，真是气象万千。1月28日小型炼钢车间二号平炉以炼六百炉钢的成就创造了全国同型平炉炉龄新纪录；接着，一号平炉也在昨天早上赶上六百炉了。现在，这两个平炉还在向更高的水平前进。小型炼钢车间的喜讯刚刚传出，昨天大型炼钢车间三号平炉又以三百炉的成绩创造了这个车间开炉三年多来的最高纪录。公司各部门刚向小型炼钢车间送完了喜报，连忙又向大型炼钢车间的职工贺喜。在向全国先进水平看齐的竞赛中，小型轧钢车间这个月共创造了二十七次生产新纪录。小型轧钢车间、炼铁车间，1月份的实际生产量都达到了以往从来没有过的水平。
    现在，全公司的职工掀起了一个找先进、赶上先进的巨大浪潮。他们那种遏制不住的热情，已经逼使公司领导上确定的年度主要生产指标，一次比一次高地修改了四、五次了；直到现在，整个公司的年度计划还没有最后确定下来。
