Xinhua News Agency report: The Indonesian government's measures against the rebels continue to receive support from some military district commanders and mass organizations; the struggle of the military and civilians in the rebel areas against the rebel groups is developing.

The Fourth Military District Commander of Central Java and the Fifth Military District Commander of East Java recently issued statements expressing their support for the central government's measures against the rebels.

Lieutenant Colonel Nanlohy, Acting Commander of the Maluku-West Irian Defense Region, also recently issued an order expressing his obedience to the leadership of the central government and the Army Chief of Staff. Nanlohy also ordered post offices, airlines, and other enterprises in his defense region to sever ties with Manado, which is occupied by the North Sulawesi rebels.

On Ambon Island in the Maluku Islands, members of sixty-five workers', youth, and student groups, totaling 20,000 people, held a demonstration on the 25th, swearing to support the central government's measures against the rebels, demanding that the central government eliminate the so-called "Revolutionary Government" in Central Sumatra and the illegal "Committees" in various places, and demanding that the Maluku local authorities ban the branches of the illegal organization "Charter of Comprehensive Struggle" group in East Indonesia that opposes the central government.

The National Committee of the All-Indonesia People's Congress also issued a statement expressing support for the government's measures against the rebel groups, believing that such measures would help eliminate colonialism.

The Indonesian Army Information Service announced on February 26 that the Gorontalo region of North Sulawesi had severed ties with the so-called "Charter of Comprehensive Struggle" group and its leader, Somba. This region has been under the control of Nani Wartabone, a local leader who has pledged allegiance to the central government, the local military police commander, and the police chief since the 25th. The Indonesian Army Headquarters has rapidly dispatched troops to Gorontalo. Gorontalo is the second most important city in North Sulawesi, second only to Manado.

According to newspaper reports, twelve soldiers from the Central Sumatra Military District escaped from the area controlled by the Hussein rebel group on the 22nd, sailing in a small boat to the government warship "Gadjah Mada," which was anchored off the coast of Padang. These Indonesian soldiers said that many soldiers who were dissatisfied with the activities of the Hussein group were preparing to escape.

Newspaper reports also said that the armed forces and people on the Mentawai Islands and Siberut Island in West Sumatra, opposite Padang port, also announced their opposition to the so-called "Revolutionary Government" established by the rebel group.
