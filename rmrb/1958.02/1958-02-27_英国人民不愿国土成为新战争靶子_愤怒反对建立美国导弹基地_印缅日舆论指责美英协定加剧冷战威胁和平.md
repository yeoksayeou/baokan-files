Xinhua News Agency, London, February 26th: The agreement between Britain and the United States to establish American missile bases in Britain has been met with fierce opposition from the British people.

After the announcement of the US-UK missile base agreement on the 24th, about 350 people rushed to the House of Commons that evening to protest the agreement to the members of Parliament.

According to the "Workers' Daily" on the 25th, ten trade union leaders from Clacton issued a statement calling on members of local trade unions to participate in the movement against the establishment of an American base in Ruislip, Middlesex, and demanding that American troops withdraw from Britain. The statement said: "We can completely do without American bombers and those American bases that would turn Britain into a fixed target in a new war." The statement also called on the working people of Clacton to demand an immediate East-West summit conference.

The British "Veterans for Peace" organization also issued a statement calling on British veterans to actively participate in the movement to protest the establishment of American missile bases in Britain, scheduled for March 1st. The statement said: "The stationing of American troops in Britain is a direct threat to the national independence for which Britain fought in the Second World War."

Even before the agreement was announced, the British people had already expressed their strong opposition to the United States establishing missile bases in Britain. Battle, a famous British fighter pilot in World War II, criticized the US plan to establish such bases in Britain as "rocket madness" in the "World News" and expressed the hope to "relieve ourselves of some of the obligations we have undertaken to our allies."

On the 23rd, a grand mass rally was also held in Ipswich, where attendees passed a resolution appealing to the British government to: stop aircraft carrying nuclear weapons from flying over British airspace while waiting for a summit conference to be held; no longer test hydrogen bombs; do not establish rocket bases on British territory and stop supplying weapons to other countries.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 26th: Several Indian newspapers have condemned the recent agreement between Britain and the United States on the establishment of missile bases in Britain, believing that this is a continuation of the policy of "shooting at will." These newspapers particularly pointed out that just as people are working hard to strive for an East-West summit conference to reach an agreement on disarmament, Britain and the United States announced this agreement.

The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" believes that this agreement "will immediately have the effect of triggering a nuclear arms race and intensifying the Cold War."

The "Hindustan Standard" said that the agreement "increases the insecurity of the British people."

The Hindi "Hindustan Daily" condemned the agreement as a "provocative act" against the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, February 26th: The Burmese "Mirror" newspaper published an editorial today saying that the agreement between Britain and the United States on the establishment of four American rocket bases in Britain is preparing for war and is a threat to world peace. People are very worried that the current preparations for establishing American rocket bases on foreign territories may cause another world war.

The editorial said, "Britain's agreement to the United States setting up rocket bases has greatly reduced its prestige. One might ask, is it still an independent country?" The editorial said that this consent shows that Britain "has reached the point of succumbing to the American authorities, as if it has become an appendage of the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th, Tokyo Dispatch: Iizuka Shoji, a commentator for the Japanese Kyodo News Agency, published a commentary on the 25th saying that the agreement signed between Britain and the United States is clearly an action that contradicts British Prime Minister Macmillan's previously expressed remarks about supporting an East-West summit conference and the British public opinion's desire for peace. This situation shows that Macmillan's support for holding an East-West summit conference is due to pressure from British public opinion, while on the other hand, he is actually implementing a policy of following the United States.

The commentator also pointed out that the agreement signed between Britain and the United States, as well as similar actions that the United States may take with other Western European countries, will cast a shadow over the future of East-West negotiations.

    英国人民不愿国土成为新战争靶子
    愤怒反对建立美国导弹基地
    印缅日舆论指责美英协定加剧冷战威胁和平
    据新华社伦敦26日电　英国同美国就在英国建立美国导弹基地问题签订协定这件事，遭到了英国人民的激烈反对。
    在24日美英导弹基地协定宣布以后，当晚就有约三百五十人赶到下院向议员们表示抗议这项协定。
    据“工人日报”25日报道，克拉顿的十名工会领袖发表了一项声明，号召各地方工会会员参加反对在米德尔塞克斯郡的鲁斯里普建立美国基地的运动，并且要求美国军队撤出英国。声明说：“我们可以完全不要美国轰炸机和那些会把英国变成新战争的固定目标的美国基地。”声明并且号召克拉顿劳动人民要求立即召开东西方最高级会议。
    英国“退伍军人保卫和平运动”组织也发表声明，号召英国的退伍军人们积极参加定在3月1日举行的抗议在英国建立美国导弹基地的运动。声明说：“美军驻扎在英国是对英国在第二次世界大战中为之而斗争的本国独立的直接威胁。”
    就在协定公布前，英国人民也已经表示他们强烈反对美国在英国建立导弹基地。在第二次世界大战中著名的英国歼击机飞行员巴特尔在“世界新闻报”上抨击美国打算在英国建立这种基地是一种“火箭狂”，并且表示希望“解除我们对各盟国所承担的某些义务”。
    23日在伊普斯威池还举行了盛大的群众集会，到会者通过了一项决议，向英国政府提出下列呼吁：在等待举行最高级会议期间制止载有核武器的飞机在英国上空飞行；今后不再试验氢弹；不要在英国领土上建立火箭基地并且停止向其他国家供应武器。
    据新华社新德里26日电　印度有几家报纸谴责英美两国最近签订的关于在英国建立导弹基地的协定，认为这是继续执行“随意开枪”的政策。这些报纸特别指出，正当人们在努力争取召开东西方最高级会议，以便就裁军问题达成协议的时候，英美两国宣布了这个协定。
    “甘露市场报”认为，这个协定“将会立刻产生激起核武器竞赛和加剧冷战的影响”。
   “印度斯坦旗报”说，这项协定“增加英国人民的不安全感”。
    印地文“印度斯坦日报”谴责这项协定是对苏联的“挑衅行为”。
    据新华社仰光26日电　缅甸“镜报”今天发表社论说，英美之间关于在英国建立四个美国火箭基地的协定是为战争进行准备，是对世界和平的威胁。人们非常担心目前关于在外国领土建立美国火箭基地的准备工作可能引起另一次世界大战。
    社论说，“英国同意美国设置火箭基地，使它的威信大大下降。人们可以问问，它是否还是一个独立国？”社论说，这种同意，表明英国“已经到了屈从美国当局的地步，好像它已经成了美国的一个附属国”。
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本共同通讯社评论员饭冢照二在25日发表评论说，英国同美国签订这项协定，显然是同英国首相麦克米伦曾经发表的关于赞同举行东西方最高级会议的言论以及英国舆论争取和平的愿望互相矛盾的行动。这种情况表明，麦克米伦赞同举行东西方最高级会议是由于受到英国舆论的压力，而在另一方面他却在实际上执行追随美国的政策。
    这位评论员同时指出，英国同美国签订这项协定以及美国同其他西欧国家可能采取的同样行动，将会为东西方举行谈判的前途投下一个暗影。
