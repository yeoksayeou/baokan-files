    A Powerful Refutation

    The North Korean Minister of Finance reported the draft budget for 1958, in which 84.7% of the total expenditure for the year is allocated to developing the people's economy and social and cultural undertakings, while defense expenditure accounts for only 5.4%. This is an extremely significant figure. At present, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is still under the direct threat of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, and the fact that it can use 80%-90% of its financial strength for peaceful construction not only powerfully demonstrates the peaceful foreign policy of socialist countries, but also fully demonstrates the strong confidence of the Korean people in their strength to defend their motherland. When the Korean government proposed that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea and that Korea be peacefully unified, the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique insisted that this was to promote the withdrawal of American troops in order to "attack" South Korea. The financial budget of North Korea is a powerful refutation of this nonsense.

    有力的驳斥
    朝鲜财政相报告了1958年的预算草案，全年支出中用于发展人民经济和社会文化事业的占预算总数的84.7％，国防费只占5.4％。这是一个极其有意义的数字。目前，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国还处在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的直接威胁之下，能以80％—90％的财政力量从事和平建设，不只是有力地说明了社会主义国家的和平外交政策，并且也充分表现出朝鲜人民对于自己保卫祖国力量的坚强信心。当着朝鲜政府提出要求一切外国军队撤离朝鲜、和平统一朝鲜的建议的时候，美国和李承晚集团都硬说这是为了促使美军撤退，以便“进攻”南朝鲜。对于这种胡说，朝鲜的财政预算，是一个有力的驳斥。
