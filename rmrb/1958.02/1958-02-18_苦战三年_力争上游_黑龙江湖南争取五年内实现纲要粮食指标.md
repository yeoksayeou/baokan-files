Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 9th: Heilongjiang Province is striving to achieve the target of 400 jin of grain per mu within five years. Fourteen cities and counties, including Shangzhi, Zhaoyuan, Huachuan, Fuyuan, Raohe, and the suburban area of Harbin, have also proposed to achieve the target of 400 jin per mu this year.

This fighting goal was put forward at the Heilongjiang Provincial Congress of Activists in Socialist Agricultural Construction, which closed on the 7th.

This meeting concentratedly reflected the revolutionary heroic spirit of the province's farmers who are fighting hard for three years and striving for the top. Zhaoyuan County, which had previously won the title of National Bumper Harvest County, was the first to propose completing the ten-year production increase target within one year. The county suffered relatively serious floods last year, but the county's farmers still put forward the slogan "Difficulties can be overcome, grain production can be increased, catch up with ten years in one year." 130,000 people are braving the severe cold and setting off a wave of enthusiasm for water conservancy construction, manure accumulation and delivery, and winter sideline production. Sideline income alone can almost compensate for all flood losses. Shangzhi County, named after the famous Anti-Japanese General Zhao Shangzhi, is using the fighting posture of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army to strike at the enemy, regardless of the cold wind and heavy snow, and has launched a four-way competition of comparing energy, comparing manure, comparing water conservancy, and comparing output. They proposed to finish delivering manure and completing water conservancy projects before the Spring Festival, and resolutely walk at the forefront of the high tide.

Feng Jixin, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report at the meeting. In his report, he pointed out that Heilongjiang Province has sufficient grounds and a reliable material foundation to complete the ten-year target within five years. He said that some agricultural cooperatives in Shandong Province can split stone mountains to grow crops and achieve a yield of 400 jin per mu. Most areas of Heilongjiang Province have several feet of deep black soil, and a yield of 400 jin per mu is entirely possible. He required all localities to do a good job in the four basic measures for increasing production, which are: basically completing farmland water conservancy construction within three years, developing 500,000 hectares of paddy fields, freeing 1 million hectares of waterlogged land from flooding, and controlling soil erosion on 1 million hectares of hilly land; accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer, increasing fertilizer application; gradually implementing mechanization and electrification; and reforming cultivation methods and cultivating and promoting superior varieties.

This newspaper reports: Reporter Huang Yubai reports: Boldly mobilizing the masses, boosting revolutionary enthusiasm, fighting hard for three years, changing the face of Hunan, and achieving the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) within five years. This is the heroic call put forward by the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China at the Provincial Agricultural Production Conference held from January 31 to February 9. According to the repeated discussions of the comrades present at the meeting, the province's agricultural production plan was revised once again, and it was decided that by 1962, the province's total grain output should reach 45 billion jin, the total output value of industry and agriculture should reach 12 billion yuan, of which the output value of local industry will increase seven times compared with the present and reach 6 billion yuan. This year, the province's total grain output is required to reach 28 billion to 30 billion jin, an increase of 25% to 33% compared with 1957. This year, the province will have one special zone and thirty-five counties and cities with an average grain yield of over 800 jin per mu ahead of schedule.

In order to welcome the upcoming upsurge in spring plowing production and to finally review and determine this year's agricultural production plan, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee used the method of dissecting sparrows at this meeting, focusing on mobilizing all the comrades present at the meeting to analyze and compare the 1958 production plans and measures of three counties, namely Liling, Changsha, and Nanxian, and requiring everyone to compare and discuss them in light of the plans and measures of their own regions and counties. Through comparison and comparison, the new situation on the current agricultural front was further clarified, the new conservative ideas such as complacency and relaxation among all the comrades present at the meeting were overcome, and the confidence and determination to strive for an overall leap forward were once again boosted. Thirty-five counties and cities in the province have proposed to achieve the requirement of 800 jin within this year, of which nine province-轄 cities generally require reaching more than 1,000 jin. Xiangtan Special Zone requires becoming the first special zone in the province to reach 800 jin.

Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, once again clarified the new situation on the current international, domestic, and agricultural fronts in the summary of the meeting, pointing out that all party comrades must boost their energy and strive for the top. Criticize the decadent work style of conservatism and sticking to old rules, and being content with backwardness, and the new right-leaning ideas of thinking that we have done almost enough and can be complacent and relaxed.

In order to realize the great leap forward in agricultural production this year, Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, asked the province to raise the original planned task of accumulating 10 billion dan of fertilizer to 30 billion dan, and asked all localities to quickly launch a large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign and complete 20 billion dan of fertilizer accumulation before and after Qingming. In order to strengthen the leadership of the Great Leap Forward movement, the Provincial Party Committee decided to conduct a province-wide inspection on a large scale around Qingming to better organize the spring plowing production upsurge.

    苦战三年　力争上游
    黑龙江湖南争取五年内实现纲要粮食指标
    据新华社哈尔滨9日电　黑龙江省争取在五年内提前实现亩产粮食四百斤的指标。尚志、肇源、桦川、抚远、饶河、哈尔滨市郊区等十四个市县，还提出在今年就提前实现亩产四百斤的要求。
    这一奋斗目标是7日闭幕的黑龙江省农业社会主义建设积极分子代表会议上提出的。
    这次会议集中地反映了全省农民苦战三年，力争上游的革命英雄气概。过去曾荣获全国丰产县称号的肇源县，这次第一个提出要在一年内完成十年的增产指标。这个县去年受到比较严重的水灾，但是全县农民仍然提出了“困难能战胜，粮食能增产，一年赶上十年”的口号，十三万人正冒着严寒掀起兴修水利、积肥送粪和冬季副业生产的热潮。仅副业收入已几乎可以弥补全部水灾损失。以著名抗日将领赵尚志命名的尚志县，正以当年抗日联军打击敌人的战斗姿态，不顾寒风大雪，展开了比干劲、比粪肥、比水利、比产量的四比竞赛。他们提出要在春节前把粪送完，把水利修完，坚决走在高潮的前面。
    中共黑龙江省委书记冯纪新在这次会上作了报告。他在报告中指出，黑龙江省在五年内完成十年的指标，是有充分的根据和可靠的物质基础的。他说，山东省有的农业社可以劈石头山种庄稼，达到亩产四百斤。黑龙江省大部分地区是数尺深的黑土，亩产四百斤是完全能办到的。他要求各地做好四项基本的增产措施，这就是：在三年内基本上完成农田水利建设，发展水田五十万公顷，使一百万公顷涝洼地免去涝灾，控制一百万公顷山岗地的水土流失；积肥造肥，增加施肥量；逐步实行机械化、电气化；改革耕作方法，培育、推广优良品种。
    本报讯　记者黄驭白报道：放手发动群众，鼓足革命干劲，苦战三年，改变湖南面貌，在五年内实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的指标。这是中共湖南省委在1月31日到2月9日召开的全省农业生产会议上提出的英雄号召。会议根据到会同志的反复讨论，又一次修订了全省农业生产规划，决定到1962年，全省粮食总产量要求达到四百五十亿斤，工农业总产值达到一百二十亿元，其中地方工业产值将比现在增加七倍而达到六十亿元。今年全省粮食总产量要求达到二百八十亿到三百亿斤，比1957年增长25％至33％。全省在今年将有一个专区、三十五个县市的粮食平均亩产量提前达到八百斤以上。
    为了迎接即将到来的春耕生产高潮，最后审查和确定今年的农业生产规划，湖南省委在这次会议上运用了解剖麻雀的办法，着重地将醴陵、长沙、南县等三个县的1958年生产规划和措施发动全体到会同志进行分析评比，并要求大家结合本地区、本县的规划和措施对照讨论。通过评比对照，进一步认清了当前农业战线上的新形势，克服了全体到会同志的自满松气等新的保守思想，再一次鼓起了争取全面大跃进的信心和决心。全省有三十五个县市提出要在今年一年内实现八百斤的要求，其中九个省辖市普遍要求达到一千斤以上。湘潭专区要求在全省中成为第一个达到八百斤的专区。
    中共湖南省委第一书记周小舟同志在会议总结中再一次地阐明了当前国际、国内和农业战线上的新形势，指出全党同志必须鼓起干劲、力争上游。批判那种保守陈规，自甘落后的没落作风，和认为做的差不多了，可以自满松气的新的右倾思想。
    为了实现今年农业生产大跃进，周小舟同志代表省委要求全省把原计划积肥任务一百亿担提高为三百亿担，并要求各地迅速来一次大规模积肥运动，在清明前后完成二百亿担的积肥任务。为了加强大跃进运动的领导，省委决定清明前后进行一次全省规模的大检查，使春耕生产高潮能够组织得更好。
