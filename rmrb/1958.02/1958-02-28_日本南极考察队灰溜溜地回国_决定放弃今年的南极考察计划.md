Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 25th: The Japanese Antarctic Expedition has abandoned its Antarctic expedition plan for this year. The expedition ship "Soya" left Antarctica at noon on the 24th to return to Japan, upon the order of the Japanese Antarctic Expedition Headquarters. Expedition leader Nagata said: "I deeply regret this failed result. I really don't know how to express my apologies to the people at home who gave us support and courage."

Last February, the "Soya" was trapped by ice in Antarctica, in a critical situation. Fortunately, the Soviet icebreaker "Ob" came to the rescue in time, allowing it to escape the danger. After repairs and replenishment, it carried scientists south again. On December 20th of last year, it arrived in Antarctica and was again trapped by ice for forty-six days, until it was rescued by an American icebreaker in early February.

    日本南极考察队灰溜溜地回国
    决定放弃今年的南极考察计划
    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本南极考察队放弃了他们今年的南极考察计划。考察船“宗谷号”奉日本南极考察指挥部之命于24日中午离开南极驶回日本。考察队队长永田说：“我为这次失败的结果而深感遗憾。我真不知道应该怎样向那些给我们以支持和勇气的国内人民表示歉意才好。”
    “宗谷号”去年2月在南极曾被冰冻所困，情况危急，幸得苏联破冰船“鄂毕号”及时救援，才脱离险境。经过修理补充后，又载科学家南行。在去年12月20日到达南极又被冰封四十六天，直到2月初才经美国破冰船救出。
