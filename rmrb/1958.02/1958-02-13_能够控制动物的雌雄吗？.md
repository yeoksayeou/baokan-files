Feeding hens gives us eggs to eat; to drink milk, we must raise cows. But when raising silkworms, raising male silkworms is more worthwhile because the cocoons spun by male silkworms produce more silk, two or three times more than those of female silkworms.

Nature, however, does not heed these considerations. Its rule is that male and female animals must pair to reproduce, and the ratio of males to females is generally half and half.

But there are also cases where female animals reproduce offspring without a male partner. Bees and aphids are examples of this. This is called virgin reproduction, or parthenogenesis. If the eggs of a queen bee are not fertilized, they develop directly into male bees. Aphids overwinter as fertilized eggs, but in the warmer seasons, they reproduce offspring through parthenogenesis, and they are born as small aphids, so they are viviparous. These small aphids are all female.

Can we use scientific methods to make other animals also undergo parthenogenesis, and have all females if we want all females, and all males if we want all males?

This is a very tempting question. If we could do this, we would only raise hens and only raise male silkworms.

Experiments on artificial parthenogenesis began in the mid-eighteenth century, but biologists at that time did not obtain any positive results. Nature strictly guarded the fortress of parthenogenesis, preventing human intrusion.

It wasn't until 1886 that the Russian scientist Professor Tikhomirov opened a gap in this solid fortress. Professor Tikhomirov used acid, friction, and other stimuli to cause the unfertilized eggs of silkworms to begin to develop, although such development failed to hatch into silkworms in the end.

Later, in the twentieth century, many biologists used various methods, using physical and chemical stimuli, to experiment with artificial parthenogenesis in animals such as sea urchins, starfish, silkworms, frogs, turkeys, and rabbits, obtaining a small number of growing individuals.

Among these, the work of Soviet scientist Professor Astaurov was the most outstanding. He took unfertilized eggs from the abdomen of female silkworm moths and immersed them in water at 46 degrees Celsius for 18 minutes. As a result, not just one or two, but 80%, sometimes even 90%, of these unfertilized eggs hatched into silkworms. The hatched silkworms were all female, with all the characteristics of the mother.

Now that it is possible to make the next generation of silkworms all female, can we make them all male silkworms? Because male silkworms can spin more silk!

Professor Astaurov's recent research has brought exciting news.

He first subjected silkworm eggs to X-ray radiation before fertilization, and then treated these eggs with a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius for 135 minutes after fertilization. As a result, all the silkworms that developed from these fertilized eggs were male, with all the characteristics of the father.

In this case, the eggs damaged by X-ray radiation did not actually participate in the formation of the embryo later. Therefore, the embryo is formed from the germ cells from the paternal side—sperm. Precisely because of this, this type of reproduction is called artificial androgenesis, or gynogenesis.

According to Professor Astaurov's report, this method is not yet perfect. But we already have full confidence that one day we will realize the long-held human desire to get animals of whatever gender we want.

    能够控制动物的雌雄吗？
    丁雁心
    喂母鸡，有蛋吃；要喝牛奶，得养母牛。养蚕，却是养雄蚕上算，因为雄蚕结的茧子丝更多些，要比雌蚕的茧多出二三成。
    自然界却不理会这些。它的规律是，雌雄两性的动物必须配对才能繁殖，而且雌雄的比例一般总是一半一半。
    但也有这样的情况，雌性动物没有雄的动物和它配对，却独自生育了后代。例如蜜蜂、蚜虫就是如此。这叫做处女生殖，也叫做孤雌生殖。雌蜂（蜂王）的卵如果没有受精，直接发育长大之后，全都是雄蜂。蚜虫是以受精卵过冬的，但在温暖的季节却以孤雌生殖的方式繁殖后代，而且一生下来就是小蚜虫，所以是胎生。这些小蚜虫全都是雌的。
    能不能用科学的方法让其他的动物也进行孤雌生殖，而且要全是雌的就全是雌的，要全是雄的就全是雄的呢？
    这是非常诱惑人的问题。要是能这样，我们就全喂母鸡，全养雄蚕。
    人工孤雌生殖的试验从十八世纪中叶就开始了，然而当时的生物学家没有得到任何正面的结果。自然界严密地守住了孤雌生殖这个堡垒不让人类进犯。
    一直到1886年，这个坚固的堡垒才被俄罗斯的科学家吉霍米罗夫教授打开了一个缺口。吉霍米罗夫教授用酸，用磨擦等等刺激，使没有受精的家蚕的卵开始发育，虽然这样的发育没能最后孵出小蚕来。
    以后，到了二十世纪，许多生物学家用种种不同的方法，用物理学的和化学的刺激，在海胆、海星、蚕、蛙、火鸡、兔子这些动物方面试验人工孤雌生殖，得到了很少数量的成长的个体。
    这其中唯有苏联科学家阿斯塔乌罗夫教授的工作最为出色。他从雌蚕蛾的腹部取出没有受精的卵，把它们放在摄氏四十六度的水里浸上十八分钟，结果在这些没有受精的卵当中，不是一个二个，而是80％，有的时候甚至于是90％，孵出小蚕来了。孵出来的小蚕全都是雌的，一切特征跟母本一样。
    既然已经能够使下一代的蚕全都是雌的了，那末能不能使它们全都是雄蚕呢？因为雄蚕能够多吐丝啊！
    阿斯塔乌罗夫教授最近的研究工作带来了使人兴奋的消息。
    他首先使蚕卵在受精以前遭受X射线的辐射，然后将这些卵在受精以后用摄氏四十度的温度处理一百三十五分钟。结果，从这些受精卵发育长大的全部都是雄蚕，一切特征跟父本一样。
    在这种情况下，受到X射线辐射的伤害的卵，实际上后来并没有参加胚胎的组成。所以，胚胎是由从父本这方面来的生殖细胞——精子——形成的。也正因为如此，这种生殖就被称为人工雄核发育，或者叫做孤雄生殖。
    根据阿斯塔乌罗夫教授的报告，这个方法目前暂时还不十分完善。但是我们已经因此有了十足的信心，总有一天，我们要实现人类由来已久的愿望，要什么性别的动物，就可以得到什么性别的动物。
