    Facing the Countryside, Relying on the Masses, Self-Reliance
    Learn from Qin County, Catch up with Qin County, Take the Road of Qin County
    Shanxi Province held a “site meeting” of local industrial cadres in Qin County, determining that the total output value of local industry in the province will double in two years, catch up with agriculture in four years, and greatly exceed it in five years. The total output value of local industry in the province in 1958 will increase by more than 50% compared with 1957, and county-run industries will double.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th: The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee convened a "site meeting" of local industrial cadres from across the province in Qin County from February 10th to 14th. It comprehensively summarized and exchanged Qin County's experience in local industry facing the countryside and serving the agricultural economy, organizing a great leap forward in local industry throughout the province.

    The meeting formulated a leap forward plan for the total output value of local industry in the province to double in two years, catch up with the total output value of agriculture in four years, and greatly exceed it in five years. Within five years, local industry throughout the province will develop more than 10,000 factories and workshops, establishing a network of rural industries.

    In order to ensure the realization of the above leap forward plan, the total output value of local industry in 1958 will increase by more than 50% compared with 1957, and county-run industries must "double." The main technical and economic indicators of local industry will also strive to catch up with the national advanced level this year.

    The meeting affirmed from the summary of Qin County's experience in running local industry that facing the countryside, relying on the masses, and self-reliance are the main roads for developing local industry.

    "Taking the road of Qin County," "learning from Qin County, catching up with Qin County," has become the common language of all the cadres attending the meeting. Industrial leaders in Jinan and Xin County, where the industrial foundation and resource conditions are better, saw that Qin County in the barren Taihang Mountains can also vigorously develop industry, which boosted their enthusiasm for organizing a great leap forward in industry. After learning the spirit of Qin County in raising local funds in every possible way to build factories, various special districts and counties revised their original conservative indicators. Thirty counties in Jinan have adopted the method of agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives raising funds to build factories, and this year they can come up with more than 10 million yuan to build 500 new small processing plants for flour, oil, and other products. The total output value target for local industry in this special district this year, which was determined at the meeting, increased by two-thirds compared with the original.

    This meeting also specifically analyzed the new situation facing local industry in Shanxi Province, enabling leaders at all levels to realize that they must change the current "single fight" approach of grasping agriculture in isolation in order to better support the great leap forward in agriculture.

    山西省在沁县举行地方工业干部“现场会议”，确定全省地方工业总产值两年翻一翻，四年赶上农业，五年大大超过。1 9 5 8年全省地方工业总产值将比1 9 5 7年增长50％以上，其中县属工业将翻一翻。
    据新华社太原16日电　中共山西省委在2月10日到14日召集全省地方工业干部在沁县举行“现场会议”，通过全面总结交流沁县地方工业面向农村、为农业经济服务的经验，组织全省地方工业的大跃进。
    会议制订出全省地方工业总产值两年翻一翻，四年赶上农业总产值，五年大大超过的跃进规划。五年内，全省地方工业将发展一万多座工厂和作坊，建立起星罗棋布的农村工业纲。
    为了确保上述跃进规划的实现，1958年地方工业总产值将比1957年增长50％以上，其中县属工业要“翻一翻”。地方工业的主要技术经济指标也努力在今年内赶上全国先进水平。
    会议从总结沁县办地方工业的经验中，肯定了面向农村、依靠群众、自力更生是发展地方工业的主要道路。
    “走沁县的路”，“学沁县、赶沁县”，成了所有到会干部的共同语言。工业基础和资源条件较好的晋南、忻县等地区的工业领导干部，看到在贫瘠的太行山区的沁县也能大力发展工业，更鼓起了组织工业大跃进的积极性。各专区、县在学习了沁县千方百计筹集地方资金建设工厂的精神以后，纷纷修改了原来的保守指标。晋南三十个县采取农业社与手工业社集资建厂的办法，今年能拿出一千多万元新建五百座面粉、油料等小型加工厂。这个专区在会上确定的今年地方工业总产值指标，比原来增长了三分之二。
    这次会议还具体分析了山西省地方工业所面临的新形势，使各地领导干部认识到必须改变目前孤立地抓农业的“单打一”作法，才能更好地支援农业大跃进。
