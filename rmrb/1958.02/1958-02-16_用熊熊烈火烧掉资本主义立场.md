    Burn Away Capitalist Standpoint with Raging Flames
    Delegate Han Wangchen said: After the anti-Rightist struggle, the tendency of most industrialists and businessmen to turn to the left has become increasingly significant. Some have even proposed a "four hearts" guarantee: First, perseverance in learning; second, confidence in reform; third, patience in helping others; and fourth, determination to break with capitalist standpoints.
    I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li and Bo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu, and I propose that the conference adopt them.
    For more than seven months, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country have launched a massive anti-Rightist struggle, which has achieved a great victory. The Rightists have been refuted, discredited, isolated, and differentiated; the political consciousness of the broad masses of the people has been greatly enhanced; and the socialist system has been further consolidated. This is a great victory for the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts for the people of the whole country, and also a major victory for our industrialists and businessmen in further accepting socialist transformation.
    In the anti-Rightist struggle, I deeply realized that only by consistently following the Party's policies and principles, presenting facts, and reasoning can we fully mobilize the masses. And only by mobilizing the masses to expose and refute the crimes of the Rightists in large numbers can we force the Rightists to bow their heads and confess their crimes in the face of irrefutable facts, and at the same time, educate the broad masses. The general situation at present is that the Rightists have basically been refuted, discredited, isolated, and differentiated. For example, a Rightist in Xi'an showed his so-called confession material to his son, who scolded him on the spot, saying, "You have disgraced my grandfather, who starved to death before liberation. Now you are a Rightist again. If you don't thoroughly confess and bow your head to admit your guilt, I have nothing to say to you," which made him feel betrayed and isolated, and he began to bow his head and voluntarily confess his crimes. Through the exercise of the movement, some people in the business community have generally further consolidated their political stance, approached the organization, and have a more correct understanding of mobilizing and relying on the masses. They have strengthened their sense of responsibility in their work and their sense of glory in striving for progress, and they are very enthusiastic and strong in their struggle. A larger part of the people have improved their awareness to varying degrees through the anti-Rightist struggle, realizing the harmfulness of the Rightists' words and deeds, clarifying the major issues of right and wrong, and distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves. At the same time, from the words and deeds of the Rightists, they also saw their own negative side. Moreover, due to the general trend, they felt that from the perspective of the individual and the country, there was only a future in taking the socialist road. The trend of turning to the left has become increasingly significant. Some have even proposed a "four hearts" guarantee, namely: 1. Have perseverance in learning; 2. Have confidence in transformation; 3. Have patience in helping others; 4. Be determined to break with the capitalist standpoint. In particular, some people who were slow to make ideological progress have been greatly shocked by the education of the movement, realizing that it is only correct to draw a line between themselves and the Rightists and actively participate in the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement. For example, some were able to expose their "private words" with the Rightists on the spot. Generally speaking, their political attitudes have all changed to some extent, which provides favorable conditions for our business community to consolidate the achievements of the anti-Rightist struggle and turn to general rectification.
    Through the practical education of the anti-Rightist struggle, the business community generally has a clearer understanding of the harmfulness of the Rightists' words and deeds and has gradually drawn a line between the enemy and ourselves and the Rightists; but this does not mean that their capitalist standpoint has been completely transformed. Judging from the problems exposed in the recent great blooming and contending, political duplicity is still relatively common and serious. For example, some are still saying "the state's policy of unified purchase and sale is too restrictive, and it is inconvenient to buy anything"; some are still trying to make exorbitant profits and are nostalgic for capitalist business methods, saying "business is not easy to do now, there are no big waves." There are also many people who are full of worries in the blooming and contending and lack the courage to open up completely. Some are still careful, afraid of saying the wrong thing and getting burned; some watch the wind at the meeting and probe the wind outside the meeting, unwilling to speak or echoing what others say, not linking it to their own ideological reality; even some individuals are still hiding to avoid the wind. In particular, they have recently added ideological concerns about "being sent to the countryside" and a mood of weariness and relaxation. May I ask, what is the root of such gains and losses, all kinds of performances proceeding from personal interests, if not the capitalist standpoint? What do these serious capitalist ideas have in common with our socialist ideas? The Rightists said that the national bourgeoisie at the present stage "no longer has two sides" and "there is no essential difference from the working class." Facts speak louder than words, which fully proves that they are deliberately lying. At the same time, it also shows that the political standpoint of our industrialists and businessmen has not yet been resolved. The objective situation is developing rapidly. Now, hundreds of millions of workers and peasants are competing to produce many amazing feats of the Great Leap Forward on the production front. If the political standpoint of our industrialists and businessmen has not been thoroughly resolved, this will not only lag far behind the workers and peasants in their enthusiasm for socialist construction; at the same time, it is also extremely unsuitable for realizing the great requirements of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy. Therefore, our vast number of industrialists and businessmen must, through the nationwide rectification movement, clarify the major issues of right and wrong in the great blooming, contending, and debate; only by clarifying the major issues of right and wrong will the movement reach a climax, promote ideological dominance, and truly break with the capitalist standpoint, establish the socialist standpoint, and thoroughly resolve the issue of political standpoint. Only in this way can we overcome the negative side and give full play to the positive side. In order to help our business community pass the socialist revolution well in politics and ideology after the high tide of the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry in 1956, the Party proposed a comprehensive rectification movement for the business community, which is very necessary and correct. I did not fully understand the great and far-reaching significance of this nationwide rectification movement at first, but after this vivid fact education, my understanding has also deepened. Our industrialists and businessmen must actively participate in the rectification movement with the correct attitude. Through the practical education of the rectification movement, continue to work hard to reform ourselves, use raging fire to burn away the capitalist standpoint, raise awareness, and boost enthusiasm. The new leap forward of workers and farmers on the production front is a good example for us. Our industrialists and businessmen must also have the determination to leap forward, take the enterprise as the base for accepting transformation, and through the practice of production and operation, transform ourselves from exploiters into genuine self-reliant laborers, wholeheartedly serving socialist construction.
    1958 is the first year of our country's second five-year plan. The great and beautiful scene and the arduous and glorious tasks of this five-year plan are calling us. I am willing to work hard to reform myself with a hundredfold confidence and determination, do a good job in my post, and advance with the people of the whole country on the bright road of socialism!
    Finally, I wish the conference a victorious success! Good health to all delegates!

### 用熊熊烈火烧掉资本主义立场

    用熊熊烈火烧掉资本主义立场
    韩望尘代表说：经过反右派斗争，多数工商业者向左转化的趋向越来越显著，有的人还提出了“四心”的保证：一、学习要有恒心；二、改造要有信心；三、帮助别人要有耐心；四、破资本主义立场要痛下决心。
    我完全同意李、薄两位副总理、彭真副委员长和吴主任的报告，建议大会通过。
    七个多月以来，全国人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，展开了声势浩大的反右派斗争，已经取得了巨大的胜利。右派已被驳倒、搞臭、陷于孤立、分化；广大人民群众的政治觉悟大为提高；社会主义制度得到了进一步的巩固。这是全国人民在政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义革命的一次伟大的胜利，也是我们工商业者进一步继续接受社会主义改造的重大胜利。
    在反右派斗争中，我深深地体会到只有始终遵循党的政策、方针，摆事实、讲道理，才能充分发动群众，也只有发动群众，大量揭发、驳斥右派罪行，才能迫使右派分子在无可辩驳的事实面前，不得不低头认罪，同时，也才能教育广大群众。目前总的情况是：右派分子基本上已经被驳倒、搞臭，陷于孤立、分化。如西安市有一个右派分子把他写好的所谓检讨材料让他儿子看，被儿子当面痛斥一顿，说“你丢了我爷爷的人，我爷爷是在解放前饿死的，你现在又是个右派，还不彻底检讨，低头认罪，我和你没话可说”，使他感到众叛亲离，陷于孤立，才开始低头，主动交代了他的罪行。工商界的部分人，通过运动的锻炼，一般进一步巩固了自己的政治立场，靠拢组织，对发动群众、依靠群众的多数，也有了较正确的认识，加强了工作的责任感和努力进步的光荣感，工作劲头很大，斗争坚强有力。较大部分的人，通过反右派斗争，在不同程度上提高了觉悟，认识到右派言行的危害性，明确大是大非，分清敌我界限；同时，从右派的言行里，也照到自己消极的一面，更由于大势所趋，觉得从个人、从国家着想，都只有走社会主义的道路才有前途，向左转化的趋向，越来越显著，有的人还提出“四心”的保证，即：1、学习要有恒心；2、改造要有信心；3、帮助别人要有耐心；4、破资本主义立场要痛下决心。特别有一部分思想进步慢的人，通过运动的教育，也受到很大的震动，认识到只有和右派划清界限，积极参加反右派斗争和整风运动才是正确的。如有的能够当场揭发他和右派分子的“私房话”。一般的说，他们的政治态度，都有所转化，这就给我们工商界在巩固反右派斗争成果和转入一般整风，提供了有利条件。
    工商界通过反右派斗争的实践教育，一般对右派言行的危害性，有了较为明确的认识，与右派逐步划清了敌我界限；但这绝不等于他们的资本主义立场完全得到转变。从最近的大鸣大放中暴露出来的问题来看，政治上的两面性还是较普遍而严重的存在着。如有人还在说“国家的统购统销政策限制太严，买啥不方便”；有的仍在企图暴利，留恋资本主义的经营方式说“现在生意不好做，没浪头”。还有不少人在鸣放中，顾虑重重，缺乏彻底敞开的勇气。有的仍是小心翼翼，怕说错话引火烧身；有的会上看风，会外探风，不肯发言或是人云亦云，不联系自己的思想实际；甚至个别还有捏故躲风的情况，特别是最近又新添了“怕下放”的思想顾虑和厌倦、松劲的情绪。试问，这种患得患失，处处从个人利害出发的种种表现，不是资本主义立场在作祟是什么？这种严重的资本主义思想和我们社会主义思想有什么共同之处？右派说民族资产阶级在现阶段已经“没有两面性了”，“和工人阶级没有本质的区别了”，事实胜于雄辩，这完全证明了他们是别有用心的假话。同时，也说明了我们工商业者的政治立场问题迄未解决。客观形势飞突发展，现在亿万工农群众在生产战线上，相竞涌现着许多大跃进的惊人事迹，我们工商业者如果政治立场问题未能得到彻底解决，这不仅对社会主义建设事业的干劲，远远落后于工农群众；同时，也极不适应实现国民经济大跃进的伟大要求。因此，我们广大的工商业者必须通过全民整风运动，在大鸣大放、大辩论中，明辨大是大非；只有明确了大是大非，运动才会达到高潮，促进思想占到上风，才能真正地破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场，彻底解决政治立场问题。只有这样，才能克服消极的一面，发挥积极的一面。党为了帮助我们工商界继一九五六年全行业公私合营高潮之后，在政治上、思想上过好社会主义革命关，提出工商界全面整风运动，是十分必要的，也是十分正确的。我原先对这全民整风的伟大深远的意义，体会不够，经过这次生动的事实教育，认识也深刻了。我们工商业者必须以正确的态度，积极投入整风运动。通过整风运动的实践教育，继续努力自我改造，要用熊熊烈火，烧掉资本主义立场，提高认识，鼓起干劲。工人和农民在生产战线上的新跃进，就是我们的好榜样。我们工商业者也要有跃进的决心，以企业为接受改造的基地，通过生产经营的实践，把自己从一个剥削者改造成为名副其实的自食其力的劳动者，全心全意地为社会主义建设服务。
    一九五八年是我国第二个五年计划开始的头一年，这个五年计划的伟大美景和繁重而光荣的任务正在召唤着我们，我愿以百倍的信心和决心，努力自我改造，做好岗位工作，和全国人民一道，在社会主义的光明大道上迈进！
    最后，祝大会胜利成功！各位代表健康！
