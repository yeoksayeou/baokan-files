I fully agree with the various work reports of the congress and resolutely implement and thoroughly promote them. In order to smoothly and better realize the Second Five-Year Plan, in the first year of the all-round development of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, it is necessary to advocate the policy of opposing conservatism, opposing waste, practicing strict economy, and running households frugally. The family is the cell of society. Every worker participating in socialist construction lives in a family. Whether the family is managed well or not directly affects the enthusiasm of each member of the family for socialist construction. Therefore, this is not only the responsibility of every housewife, but also the common task of all the people. Now I would like to talk about how Wuhan City, Hubei Province, is implementing frugality in household management.

Large Numbers of "Five-Good" Individuals and Units Emerge

In the past few years, Wuhan City, like other parts of the country, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, has been relatively universally and deeply implementing the "Five-Good" work guided by socialist ideology among the families of workers and working women since 1954. Combined with the specific local conditions, it was proposed to have good plans for living, encourage workers to produce well, unite and help each other well, study and educate children well, and ensure safety and hygiene well. From then on, the "Five-Good" team emerged from scratch, from few to many. Tens of thousands of "Five-Good" activists have emerged. By 1956, the implementation rate in the streets with a better work base reached about 90%. General streets reached more than 70%. Even in the streets with poor work, it reached 60%. In factories, enterprises, organs, handicraft cooperatives, and suburban agricultural production cooperatives, varying degrees of "Five-Good" socialist ideological education work on specific measures for frugal household management were carried out for workers, cooperative cadres, and cooperative members, and good results were achieved. In particular, after publicizing and implementing the policy of building the country through diligence and frugality and managing households frugally pointed out by the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in 1957, combined with the development of the increase production and practice economy movement, the enthusiasm of the masses for implementing the "Five-Good" has become even higher. In 1957, the city commended and praised 9,634 "Five-Good" activists who were good at managing households frugally, 102 "Five-Good" families, and 43 "Five-Good" collective units after evaluation. This not only greatly promoted the widespread and in-depth development of the "Five-Good" work, but also played a backbone leading role in completing the central tasks of the Party in various periods. In the fourth quarter of 1957, the Municipal People's Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Women's Federation jointly convened a city-wide three-level (street, district, city) experience exchange and commendation conference for "Five-Good" activists. At the same time, a city-wide three-level (street, district, city) exhibition of frugal household management (mainly four major savings: grain, cloth, coal, water and electricity) was organized, which was visited by 100,000 people in more than 20 days. It won the praise of the broad masses. After the meeting, combined with the Spring Festival, socialist ideological education was carried out, setting off a wave of comprehensive publicity for frugal household management. Continued touring exhibitions were held separately, and in a small, lively, and vivid manner, they returned to various factories and enterprises, and went door-to-door to deeply and comprehensively publicize frugal household management.

Economic Mutual Aid Benefits Both Individuals and Others

In recent years, through the specific implementation of good plans for living and good unity and mutual assistance, the widespread development of the mass economic mutual aid movement has been greatly promoted. According to statistics in 1957, there are currently 4,257 economic mutual aid groups, with 78,665 participants, and a total deposit of 150,631.63 yuan. 40,873 difficult problems have been solved for the masses in a timely manner. The masses said that the economic mutual aid group has four advantages: First, it is good for oneself to save small amounts and withdraw large amounts; second, it is good to help poor households and not be exploited by usury; third, it is good for the country's construction to deposit money in the bank; fourth, it cracks down on informal mutual-aid societies and establishes a socialist moral atmosphere of changing customs and habits.

There are Many Tricks for the Four Major Savings

In terms of the four major savings, the masses have given full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, thought of ways to find tricks, and accumulated many practical and feasible good methods. For example, in terms of saving grain, they created "rice-saving mothers," "soaking rice and steaming rice," and doing it on time, in quantity, and at each meal, so as to "have a plan every day, not lack grain at the end of the month, and hand over the surplus grain." In terms of saving cloth, the "new for the eldest, old for the second, sewing and mending for the third" has been widely used, changing large to small, splicing small to large, turning old into new, tailoring clothes, and wearing whatever is available. In terms of saving water and electricity, many residential groups have jointly replaced large light bulbs with small light bulbs, and implemented turning on the lights when in use, turning off the lights when leaving, turning on the lights late, and turning off the lights early, so as not to waste a single unit of electricity. In terms of saving coal, honeycomb briquettes have been widely adopted, and many people have also changed large stoves to small ones, deep stoves to shallow ones, and not burned empty fires. According to incomplete statistics in December last year, the residents of the city sold a total of 179,500 honeycomb briquettes (not including the tens of thousands of honeycomb briquettes sold at the frugal household management exhibition). If only one coal ball is saved from a honeycomb briquette (a ceramic honeycomb briquette can be used 100 times, costing 2 fen each), then the city can save 1,923 tons of coal, calculated by the monthly coal consumption of 2.1 million people. Furthermore, from the actual situation of the fifteenth residential group of Gejiaying, Liangdaojie Street, Wuchang District, a "Five-Good" collective unit of 40 households in the city, from April to October 1957, the result of implementing strict economy within half a year was that they saved a total of 1,090 jin of grain, 7,980 coal balls, 1,290 dan of water, and handed over 799 chi of cloth coupons. If these materials are converted into RMB, it would be 545.82 yuan, with an average monthly saving of 90 yuan. According to the monthly saving of more than 2 yuan per household, if we assume that the city has 2.1 million people with 400,000 households, the accumulated amount of implementing strict economy is considerable. Therefore, it is said that implementing strict economy is beneficial to individuals and families, and it also meets the needs of national socialist economic construction.

We have a responsibility to widely and deeply publicize this among the people of the whole province. We must be diligent and thrifty, practice strict economy, invest more funds in the national construction cause, and build the motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as quickly as possible. Let us work together for the happy and beautiful life of future generations.

The above speech is for your correction.

　　家庭节约  大有可为
    李冬青代表谈武汉市贯彻执行勤俭持家的经验
    我完全同意大会各项工作报告并坚决贯彻执行深入宣传。为了顺利地更好地实现第二个五年计划，在工、农业生产大跃进的全面发展的第一年，提倡反保守、反浪费、厉行节约、勤俭持家的方针是必要的。家庭是社会的细胞，每一个参加社会主义建设的劳动者，都生活在家庭里，家庭主持的好与不好，都直接影响着家庭里每个成员的社会主义建设积极性。因此，这不仅是每个家庭主妇的责任，而且也是全体人民的共同任务。现在我想就湖北省武汉市是在怎样贯彻执行勤俭持家谈一谈。
    “五好”个人和单位大批涌现
    武汉市几年以来和全国各地一样在中央和毛主席正确领导下，从一九五四年就比较普遍深入地在全市职工家属和劳动妇女中，贯彻以社会主义思想为指导的“五好”工作。结合当地具体情况提出，日子计划好，鼓励职工生产好，团结互助好，学习和教育子女好，安全卫生好。从此，“五好”队伍便从无到有、从少到多。“五好”积极分子成千上万的涌现出来。到一九五六年在工作基础比较好的街道里执行面达到百分之九十左右。一般的街道达到百分之七十以上。就是在工作较差的街道里也达到了百分之六十。在工厂、企业、机关、手工业社和郊区农业生产合作社都不同程度地对职工、社干、社员作了勤俭持家具体措施的“五好”社会主义思想教育工作，收到了良好效果。特别是经过宣传贯彻一九五七年党中央八届三中全会指出勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针以后，结合增产节约运动的开展，广大群众贯彻“五好”的积极性更为高涨。一九五七年全市经过评选表扬了九千六百三十四个善于勤俭持家的“五好”积极分子，一百零二个“五好”家庭和四十三个“五好”集体单位。这不仅大大推动了“五好”工作广泛深入开展，而且在完成党在各个时期的中心工作中起着骨干带头作用。在一九五七年四季度，由市人委、市工会、市妇联联合召开了全市三级（街、区、市）“五好”积极分子经验交流表扬大会。同时还组织了全市三级（街、区、市）勤俭持家展览会（主要是四大节约：粮、布、煤、水电）二十多天中，就有十万人次参观。博得了广大群众的好评。会后结合春节进行社会主义思想教育，掀起一个全面宣传勤俭持家热潮。继续地分别作巡回展出，以小型、活泼、生动的方式分别回到各工厂、企业，以送上门去的办法，深入全面广泛宣传勤俭持家。
    经济互助　利己利人
    几年以来通过以日子计划好和团结互助好的具体贯彻，大大推动了群众性经济互助运动的广泛开展。据一九五七年统计现有四千二百五十七个经济互助组，有七万八千六百六十五人参加，存款共有一十五万零六百三十一元六角三分。为群众及时地解决了四万零八百七十三件困难问题。群众这样说，经济互助组有四好，一是零存整取对自己好，二是互助了困难户，不受高利贷剥削好，三是钱存银行对国家建设好，四是打击了标会，树立了移风易俗社会主义道德风气好。
    四大节约窍门真多
    从四大节约方面，群众发挥积极性和创造性，想办法找窍门，积了许多切实可行的好办法。比如节约用粮方面，创造了“留饭娘”“泡米蒸饭”，按时，按量，按顿，作到“天天有计划，月底不缺粮，余粮上交”等办法。节约用布已普遍应用了“新老大，旧老二，缝缝补补是老三”，大改小，小拼大，翻旧改新，量体裁衣，有啥穿啥。节约用水电方面，许多居民小组一起把大灯泡换成小灯泡，执行了随用随开灯，随走随关灯，晚开灯，早熄灯，不让浪费一度电。在节约用煤方面，已普遍采用旺火球，许多人还把大炉子改小、深炉子垫浅、不烧空火。去年十二月据不完全统计，全市居民群众中共推销了一十七万九千五百多个旺火球（不包括勤俭持家展览会上销出几万个旺火球在内）。如果从一个旺火球仅节约一个煤球的话（陶器制造品一个旺火球可用一百次，每个两分钱），全市以一个月的二百一十万人口用煤量计算，就可节约一千九百二十三吨。再从本市武昌区粮道街戈甲营第十五居民小组四十户的一个“五好”集体单位的实际情况来看，这个组由一九五七年四月起到十月，半年之内实行厉行节约的结果是一共节约了粮食一千零九十斤、煤球七千九百八十斤、水一千二百九十担、上交布票七百九十九尺。若把这些物资折计人民币，则为五百四十五元八角二分，平均每个月节约了九十元。按每户每月节约为二元多，假定全市二百一十万人口以四十万户计算厉行节约累积起的数目是可观的。所以说厉行节约对个人、家庭有利，又符合了国家社会主义经济建设需要。
    我们有责任，要在全省人民中广泛深入地宣传。必须克勤克俭、厉行节约，把更多资金投入到国家建设事业中去，尽可能迅速地把祖国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。为子孙万代幸福美好生活而共同奋斗。
    以上发言，请指正。
