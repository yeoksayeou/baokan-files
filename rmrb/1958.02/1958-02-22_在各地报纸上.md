    Inter-Provincial Cooperation Promotes Production
    The four provinces and autonomous regions in Northwest China: Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, recently held an inter-provincial cooperation conference in Lanzhou. They plan to strengthen close cooperation in economic and cultural construction to jointly promote the great leap forward in production. Gansu Daily prominently reported on this conference on the first page of its February 18th edition. At the meeting, each province and region exchanged information on industry and agriculture and construction experience. After discussion, agreements were reached on cooperation in industry, agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, and cultural education. In agriculture, the provinces and regions mainly exchanged improved crop varieties and superior livestock. In industry, the provinces and regions will support each other with machinery and equipment, provide factory blueprints, and other technical data.

    Festive Atmosphere on the Page
    February 18th was the Spring Festival. The layout of the first page of Shanxi Daily on this day was well-organized, not only full of the festive atmosphere of spring, but also vividly and prominently reporting the situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the province. One-third of the page reported on the massive and magnificent high tide of industrial production surging forward in Taiyuan City. In agriculture, it reported on the various activities of Xin County, Guo County, Jincheng, Changzi, Linfen, Quwo, Hejin, Huo County, and other counties striving for a yield of 400 jin per mu. Its main title was "New Names Continuously Added to the 400 Jin Red List," which was very encouraging.

    The Ambition of Urumqi Prefecture
    The Xinjiang Daily reported on the front page on February 9th that Urumqi Prefecture aims to become a 100-jin cotton prefecture this year. At the recent agricultural production great leap forward conference held in the prefecture, the leap forward plan for agricultural production this year was revised. The new plan determines that the sowing area in the entire prefecture this year will reach more than 2.4 million mu, of which 170,000 mu of cotton will achieve a yield of 103 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 23.4% over the actual production last year, making it the first 100-jin cotton prefecture in the autonomous region. The production of grain and oil crops will also increase by more than 25% compared to last year's actual production.

    Forty-Nine Pigs Per Household
    The Guizhou Daily reported on February 14th: Xinle Township, Zheng'an County, which won the title of pig-raising model township in Guizhou Province, plans to develop 34,090 pigs of various types in 1958, an average of 49.1 pigs per household, an increase of 56.4% compared to last year. Among them, collective pig raising averages 10 pigs per household; commune members raising pigs averages 39.1 pigs per household.

    To ensure the realization of the plan, Xinle Township decided to take several measures: fully utilize wild feed, build 200 new pigsties, strengthen the prevention and control of swine epidemics, improve feeding management, and rationally arrange labor. It is also necessary to ensure that pig raising and production are not delayed.

    Doing It Yourself Quickly and Well
    On February 16th, the Chengdu Daily reported on the first page a new atmosphere that has emerged in the street renovation work in Chengdu, that is, according to the needs of the masses, residents are mobilized to repair streets, mend roads, dig ditches, and dredge wells themselves, solving some public welfare problems related to the daily lives of the masses. If these things were done by the state, it would inevitably cost some construction funds, and it might not be as fast and good as the masses doing it themselves. For example, if the government were to renovate Beishuyuan Street, it would require 120 workers and cost more than 100 yuan, but the result of the masses doing it themselves was only 3 yuan. The Chengdu Daily also published an editorial praising this approach.

    The Birth of Thirty-Seven Sugar Refineries
    The Yunnan Daily reported on February 11th that Yuxi Prefecture, relying on the masses' self-reliance, built 37 small-scale mechanical sugar refineries with a daily output of 20 tons in Yuanjiang, Xinping, and other five counties, solving the problem of sugarcane processing in the entire region. If the state invested in the construction of these 37 factories, it would require more than 800,000 yuan. Yuxi Prefecture adopted the method of combining with agricultural cooperatives to build factories. The bank loaned money to the Yuxi Agricultural Implement Factory to manufacture machines. The construction of factory buildings was funded by a small amount of state investment, and the agricultural cooperatives provided labor. The infrastructure and installation took only about two months, catching up with the pressing season. From December last year to January this year, not only was the loan repaid, but also more than 600,000 yuan was turned over to the state.

    省际协作促进生产
    西北四个省、区：陕西、甘肃、青海、新疆维吾尔自治区，最近在兰州举行省际协作会议，计划加强四省区在经济、文化建设方面的密切协作，共同促进生产大跃进。甘肃日报18日一版以显著地位报道了这次会议的情况。会上各省区交换了工农业方面的情况和建设的经验，经过讨论，对工、农业、水利、交通和文化教育等方面的协作达成协议。在农业方面各省区主要是交换农作物良种和优良牲畜。工业方面各省区之间要互相支援机器设备、提供建厂图纸和其他技术资料。
    报面上的节日气氛
    18日是春节，这一天山西日报一版的版面组织得好，不仅充满了春天的节日气氛，还生动醒目地报道了这个省工农业生产大跃进的形势。全版三分之一的篇幅报道了太原全市声势浩大、规模壮阔的工业生产高潮奔腾前进的情况，农业方面报道了忻县、崞县、晋城、长子、临汾、曲沃、河津、霍县等县力争亩产四百斤的各种活动，它的主标题是“四百斤红榜上续列新名”，给人以很大鼓舞。
    乌鲁木齐专区的壮志
    9日新疆日报一版头条报道乌鲁木齐专区今年要成为棉花百斤专区。在这个专区最近举行的农业生产大跃进会议上，重新修订了今年农业生产的跃进计划。新的计划确定：今年全区播种面积将达到二百四十多万亩，其中十七万亩棉花要做到亩产皮棉一百零三斤，比去年实产增加23.4％，成为自治区第一个棉花百斤专区。粮食和油料作物，也都比去年实产增加25％以上。
    每户养猪四十九头
    14日贵州日报报道：荣获贵州省养猪模范乡称号的正安县新乐乡，计划在1958年发展各种猪三万四千零九十头，平均每户养猪四十九点一头，比去年增加56.4％。其中集体养猪平均每户十头；社员养猪平均每户三十九点一头。
    为了保证计划的实现，新乐乡决定采取几项措施：充分利用野生饲料，新建二百间猪栏，加强防治猪疫，改进饲养管理，合理安排劳力。并且要做到养猪、生产两不误。
    自己动手又快又好
    16日，成都日报在一版报道了成都市街道整改工作中出现的一种新气象，即根据群众的要求，发动居民自己动手修街、补路、挖沟、淘井，解决了一些与群众日常生活有关的公共福利问题。这些事情由国家来办，少不得又要花去一些建设资金，并且还不一定像群众自己办那样又快又好。如北书院街翻修街道，如果政府来办，就要请一百二十个人工，开支一百多元，但群众自己办的结果，只用了三元钱。成都日报并发表了社论表扬这种做法。
    三十七个榨糖厂的诞生
    11日云南日报报道了玉溪专区依靠群众自力更生，在元江、新平等五县新建了三十七个日榨二十吨的小型机榨糖厂，解决了全区甘蔗加工的问题。兴建这三十七个厂，如果由国家投资，就需要八十多万元，玉溪专区采取同农业社结合建厂的办法，由银行贷款给玉溪农具制造厂造机器，厂房修建由国家出少量投资，农业社出劳动力，基建和安装只花了两个月左右的时间，赶上了榨季。从去年12月到今年1月，不仅还清了贷款，还给国家上缴了六十多万元。
