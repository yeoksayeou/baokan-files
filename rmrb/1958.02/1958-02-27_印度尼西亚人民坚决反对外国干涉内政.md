    Indonesian People Resolutely Oppose Foreign Interference in Internal Affairs
    Commentator of this newspaper
    Under the leadership of President Sukarno, the Indonesian government and military authorities have launched a resolute struggle against the rebel groups. The Indonesian government has imposed a naval and air blockade on the rebel-held areas, and bombed the radio stations controlled by the rebels in Padang, Bukittinggi, and Manado. These measures have dealt a powerful blow to the rebels.
    The reason why the Indonesian rebels have been able to carry out separatist activities for a long time, even to the point of openly organizing a so-called "revolutionary government," is mainly because of the support of imperialism behind them.
    The imperialist colonial forces have long regarded the independent policy pursued by the Indonesian government under the leadership of President Sukarno as a thorn in their side. The imperialists have long been engaged in conspiracies to subvert the current Indonesian government, undermine Indonesia's anti-colonialist struggle, and re-enslave the Indonesian people. The rebellion in Central Sumatra is only the surface manifestation of this conspiracy. And through this event, people have more clearly seen that the instigator of the conspiracy is American imperialism.
    Before and after the outbreak of the rebellion in Central Sumatra, the United States openly came forward to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. Dulles, White, and others repeatedly attacked the Indonesian government and President Sukarno. They even arrogantly said, "The Republic of Indonesia was established, at least in part, because the United States believed that this republic should be established." American newspapers also blatantly expressed their hostile attitude toward the Indonesian government. The "New York Herald Tribune" even called the rebels "revolutionaries," and the "New York Times" used this as an excuse to propose that the United Nations intervene in the current situation in Indonesia. American news agencies have also put in great effort to cooperate with the rebel activities and carry out propaganda reports hostile to the Indonesian government and people. The activities of foreign interventionists are far more than this. The Manila Treaty Organization, manipulated by the United States, unscrupulously participated in activities against Indonesia. These activities include transporting weapons and sending instructors to train rebels. Among these weapons, there are even anti-aircraft guns and British armored vehicles. The Philippines, Singapore, and other places have become footholds for the rebels' open activities. The US Seventh Fleet is conducting threatening "exercises" in the sea south of Luzon. The Manila Treaty Organization meeting next month will plan to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs.
    What is the purpose of foreign intervention? President Sukarno recently pointed out that a certain foreign force is dissatisfied with Indonesia's policy of active independence and demands that Indonesia lean to one side, or pull part of Indonesia into a certain bloc. President Sukarno said that Indonesia will not ignore this foreign interference. The government and all the Indonesian people have the responsibility to save the Republic of Indonesia.
    The Indonesian people have increasingly clearly seen that their struggle with the rebels is also a struggle with imperialism. This is a serious struggle to defend Indonesia's national interests. We believe that as long as all patriotic people in Indonesia unite as one and persevere in the struggle, then all foreign imperialist conspiracies to interfere by using a few Indonesian rebels will be completely defeated. The Chinese people fully support the heroic struggle of the Indonesian people to defend their national interests and condemn all the criminal activities of imperialism in interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs.

    印度尼西亚人民坚决反对外国干涉内政
    本报评论员
    在苏加诺总统领导下，印度尼西亚政府和军事当局，已经对叛乱集团展开了坚决的斗争。印度尼西亚政府对叛乱地区进行了海空封锁，炸毁了巴东、武吉丁宜和万鸦老三处叛乱分子所控制的电台。这些措施，给予了叛乱分子以有力的打击。
    印度尼西亚的叛乱分子，所以能长期进行分裂活动，以至公开组织所谓“革命政府”，主要是由于有帝国主义在后面支持。
    帝国主义殖民势力，对于在苏加诺总统领导下的印度尼西亚政府所奉行的独立政策，早已视若眼中钉。帝国主义者久已在进行阴谋活动，企图颠覆印度尼西亚现政府，破坏印度尼西亚的反殖民主义斗争，重新奴役印度尼西亚人民。中苏门答腊的叛乱事件，不过是这种阴谋活动的表面化。而透过这一事件，人们已经更清楚地看到，阴谋的主使者是美国帝国主义。
    在中苏门答腊叛乱事件爆发前后，美国就公开出头露面干涉印度尼西亚内政。杜勒斯、怀特等人，接连攻击印度尼西亚政府和苏加诺总统。他们甚至狂妄地说：“印度尼西亚共和国得以成立，至少一部分原因是因为美国认为应该成立这个共和国”。美国的报纸，也露骨地表现了敌视印度尼西亚政府的态度。“纽约先驱论坛报”竟把叛乱分子称为“革命者”，“纽约时报”借此由头，提出由联合国来干预印度尼西亚目前的局势。美国通讯社更大卖气力，配合叛乱活动，进行敌视印度尼西亚政府和人民的宣传报道。外国干涉者的活动还绝不止于此。美国所一手操纵的马尼拉条约组织，毫无顾忌地参加了反对印度尼西亚的活动。这些活动，包括输送武器和派遣教官训练叛乱分子等，在这些武器中，甚至有高射炮和英国的装甲车。菲律宾、新加坡等地，都成了叛乱分子公开活动的立足点。美国第七舰队在吕宋南部海面“演习”进行威胁。下月举行的马尼拉条约组织会议，将策划干涉印度尼西亚内政。
    外国的干涉是为的什么呢？苏加诺总统最近指出：某种外国势力对印度尼西亚奉行积极的独立政策感到不满，并且要求印度尼西亚倒向一边，或者把印度尼西亚的一部分拉入某个集团。苏加诺总统说：印度尼西亚对外国的这种干涉不会置之不理。政府和全印度尼西亚人民有责任拯救印度尼西亚共和国。
    印度尼西亚人民已经越来越清楚地看到，他们同叛乱分子的斗争，也就是同帝国主义的斗争。这是一场保卫印度尼西亚民族利益的严重斗争。我们相信，只要印度尼西亚一切爱国人民团结一致，坚持斗争，那末一切外国帝国主义利用印度尼西亚少数叛乱分子的干涉阴谋，必将完全失败。中国人民完全支持印度尼西亚人民为保卫自己民族利益的英勇斗争，谴责帝国主义干涉印度尼西亚内政的一切罪恶活动。
