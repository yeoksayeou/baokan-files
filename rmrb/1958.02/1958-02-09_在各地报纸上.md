　　On Newspapers Across the Country
　　Eight Hundred Million, Eight Hundred Million, and Eight Hundred Million More!
　　After overfulfilling the water conservancy project of 1.6 billion cubic meters in the province, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee recently proposed a new battle slogan: add another 800 million to complete 2.4 billion cubic meters!
　　The Anhui Daily published an editorial on the 6th, titled "Eight Hundred Million, Eight Hundred Million, and Eight Hundred Million More!" This editorial, in enthusiastic language, reviewed how the revolutionary drive of the broad masses repeatedly broke through the original plan, increasing the water conservancy construction target from more than 400 million cubic meters to 800 million, then to 1.6 billion. And now, the masses are running ahead again. Can another 800 million be completed? After analyzing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, as well as the time and climate conditions, the editorial answered affirmatively: "Yes! It definitely can."
　　This editorial also mentioned difficulties, but it pointed out with a dialectical viewpoint that as long as we face the difficulties squarely and actively overcome them, unfavorable conditions will turn into favorable ones.
　　A Small "Guanzhuang" in Shanghai
　　On the 5th, several Shanghai newspapers exposed a small "Guanzhuang" in Shanghai – the Shanghai Forest Products Chemistry Laboratory of the Ministry of Forestry Industry. There was no system, no discipline, and everyone could freely stroll the streets, visit other departments, and chat during work hours. This unit had neither administrative meetings nor political studies. Although a lot of books were bought and many magazines were subscribed to with public money, there was not a single Party newspaper. All political movements were unrelated to this unit. Even for general cleaning, they had to hire temporary workers.
　　Since the establishment of this unit, the Ministry of Forestry Industry only managed the investment in basic construction, and the Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Industry Company only sent them some meeting notices. No one cared about ideological and political work, and bourgeois ideology occupied this "blank space."
　　Several newspapers published short commentaries on this matter. The short commentary in the Liberation Daily raised a question: Is this kind of "free kingdom" the only one in Shanghai? This needs to be carefully checked by each unit. The short commentary in the News Daily pointed out that there are many units like this in Shanghai that are far from the higher authorities and "the mountains are high and the emperor is far away." The local relevant departments should strengthen their political and ideological leadership.
　　A "Horn of Promotion"
　　On the 6th, the Heilongjiang Daily published the news that Ning'an County, Heilongjiang Province, had basically eliminated illiteracy nine years ahead of schedule, in the top headline position on the first page, and published an editorial titled "Horn of Promotion."
　　Of the more than 102,000 young and middle-aged people in Ning'an County, illiterates originally accounted for more than 75%. After the establishment of winter schools in 1948, rapid literacy and civil schools were promoted. More than 90% of the illiterates have enrolled in school. By the end of January this year, the proportion of non-illiterates had reached 81% of the total number of young and middle-aged people in urban and rural areas of the county. It is expected that on "July 1st" this year, the task of eliminating illiteracy as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) will be fully realized nine years ahead of schedule, and three years ahead of the provincial plan.
　　The improvement of the cultural level of the vast number of young and middle-aged people in this county has not only promoted the development of production and enlivened rural cultural life, but also produced the role of changing customs and habits.
　　A Heroic County Industrial Plan
　　The Henan Daily reported on the 5th that Ji'yuan County had formulated a heroic and ambitious county industrial Great Leap Forward plan and published an editorial titled "A Plan for Another Leap Forward." This plan proposes that the county's industrial output value should exceed agriculture within five years and increase by twenty-two times within ten years. Yang Weiping, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally helped the Ji'yuan County Party Committee summarize the "six main" experiences in developing county industry, which are: mainly relying on own raw materials, mainly relying on the accumulation of funds from local industry and handicrafts, mainly relying on small-scale, mainly relying on running comprehensive enterprises, mainly relying on existing technical forces, and mainly relying on local sales. Under this guiding ideology, the county party committee, with the establishment of a mechanical industry outline, a fertilizer manufacturing outline, and a power outline as the center, proposed a ten-year industrial development plan including thirty-four items, which has now been printed and distributed throughout the county for discussion.
　　Break the Thousand-Year-Old Habits
　　On the 6th, the Shaanxi Daily published on an important position on the first page the news that more than 30,000 laborers in Suide County broke the old habits of thousands of years and sent manure to the mountains ahead of schedule, launching a drought well digging campaign, and published a short commentary, believing that Suide County "has taken this step well." This action marks that the county has embarked on the journey of the Great Leap Forward in production. Another great benefit of this method is that by sending manure to the mountains early, labor can be freed up to immediately carry out land basic construction such as water conservancy and soil and water conservation after the thaw. Many counties in northern Shaanxi are to have a Great Leap Forward, and there is a difficulty of insufficient labor. Suide County has set an example, and it will be easier for other places to handle. The short commentary in the Shaanxi Daily said well: "One step taken, two steps are easy to take."
　　Guizhou's Agricultural Swearing-in Meeting
　　The Guizhou Daily on February 2nd reported on the provincial agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy labor model conference and agricultural exhibition on the prominent position on the first page and the entire second page and published an editorial on "Everyone Learns from Advanced Models." Among the labor models attending this meeting was a 115-year-old Miao ethnic group afforestation hero, Grandpa Yang, whose hands have turned his hometown into a forest zone.
　　The communication titled "Strange News at the Agricultural Exhibition" introduced many rare products and heroic creations, including soybeans growing on trees and cassava growing on trees.
　　Scientific Research Does Not Use State Funding
　　On the 6th, the Tianjin Daily published a noteworthy news item in the upper left corner of the second page: A rubber industry research institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry in Tianjin is preparing to use the equipment of its own pilot plant to produce some products from this year, to achieve self-sufficiency and no longer let the state allocate research funding. Doing so can also better combine scientific research with production practice.
　　The rubber industry research institute has high annual expenses, and the state allocated more than 800,000 yuan in research funding last year. However, the utilization rate of many new machines in the institute's pilot plant is very low. This year, it was decided to make full use of them. In addition to completing research tasks, some car tires and rubber industrial products will be produced, and some processing businesses will be undertaken. In this way, an output value of 5.64 million yuan can be created throughout the year, and the profit obtained can not only offset the expenses of the entire institute but also have a surplus. In this way, the 860,000 yuan of scientific research funding that the state prepared to allocate this year can be completely waived.

专栏：在各地报纸上

　　在各地报纸上
    八亿、八亿、再八亿！
    安徽省委在全省超额完成了十六亿公方的水利工程之后，最近又提出了新的战斗口号：再加八亿，完成二十四亿公方！
    安徽日报6日发表了社论，题目是：“八亿、八亿、再八亿！”这篇社论以热情洋溢的语言，回顾了广大群众的革命干劲怎样一再地突破原定计划，使得兴修水利工程的指标由四亿多公方增加到八亿，又增加到十六亿，而现在，群众又跑到前面去了。再来一个八亿，能完成吗？社论在分析了群众的积极性、创造性和时间、气候等条件后，肯定地回答：“能！一定能。”
    这篇社论也谈到了困难，但是它以辩证的观点指出，只要我们正视困难，积极地加以克服，不利就会变为有利。
　　上海的一个小“管庄”
    5日，上海的几家报纸揭发了上海的一个小“管庄”——森林工业部上海林产化学试验室。这里没有制度，没有纪律，上班时每个人都可以自由自在逛马路、串门户、聊天。这个单位既无行政会议，更无政治学习，虽然用公家的钱买了很多书籍、订了很多杂志，可就是没有一份党报。一切政治运动都和这个单位无关，就连大扫除，他们也要请临时工来做。
    这个单位成立以来，森林工业部只管了基本建设的投资，上海化学原料工业公司则仅仅向他们发过一些开会通知，一切思想政治工作无人过问，资产阶级思想便占领了这个“空白点”。
    几家报纸都对这件事发表了短评。解放日报的短评提出了一个问题：像这样的“自由王国”，在上海是不是只有一个呢？这是要请各个单位很好检查的。新闻日报的短评指出，这种远离上级机关、“山高皇帝远”的单位在上海很多，地方有关部门应当加强对它们的政治思想领导。
    一支“促进的号角”
    6日黑龙江日报以第一版头条地位刊登了黑龙江省宁安县提前九年基本扫除文盲的消息，并以“促进的号角”为题发表了社论。
    宁安县十万二千多青壮年，原来文盲占75％以上，1948年成立冬学后又推行速成识字、举办民校。90％以上的文盲都入了学，到今年1月底，非文盲的比例已经达到全县城乡青壮年总数的81％，预计在今年“七一”，将提前九年全部实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的扫除文盲的任务，比省的规划也提前了三年。
    这个县广大青壮年文化水平的提高，不仅促进了生产的发展，活跃了农村文化生活，而且产生了移风易俗的作用。
　　一个豪迈的县工业规划
    河南日报5日报道了济源县制定的英雄豪迈的县工业大跃进规划，并以“一个跃进再跃进的规划”为题发表社论。这个规划提出五年内县工业产值要超过农业，十年内要增长二十二倍。中共河南省委书记杨蔚屏并亲自帮助济源县委总结了发展县工业的“六主”经验，这就是：以自有原料为主，以地方工业手工业本身积累资金为主，以小型为主，以办综合性的企业为主，以现有技术力量为主，以就地销售为主。在这一指导思想下，县委以建立机械工业纲、肥料制造纲和动力纲为中心，提出了包括三十四项的十年发展工业规划，现已印发全县讨论。
    打破千年旧习惯
    6日陕西日报在一版的重要地位刊登了绥德县农民三万多劳动力打破千年来的陈规旧习提前送粪上山、掀起打旱井运动的消息，并发表短评，认为绥德县“这一步踏得好”。这种行动标志着这个县已迈上了生产大跃进的行程。这个办法还有一个更大的好处就是，提早把粪送上山，就可以腾出劳动力，在解冻后马上动手进行水利和水土保持等土地基本建设。陕北地区的许多县都要大跃进，都存在劳动力不足的困难。绥德县做出了样子，别的地方也就好办了。陕西日报的短评说得好：“一步踏开，两步好走”。
    贵州的农业誓师大会
    2月2日的贵州日报，以一版显著地位和二版整版报导了全省农、林、水利劳模大会和农业展览会，并发表了“人人学先进”的社论。出席这次会议的劳动模范中有一位一百一十五岁的苗族造林老英雄杨公公，经他的双手已把自己的家乡变成了森林地带。
    在题为“农展会上的奇闻”的通讯中，介绍出了许多珍奇的产品和英雄的创造，有树上结的黄豆，还有树上结的木薯。
　　科学研究不用国家拨款
    6日天津日报二版左上角刊登了这样一条引人注意的消息：化学工业部在天津的一个橡胶工业研究所，准备从今年起，利用自己试验工厂的设备，生产一部分产品，做到自给自足，不再让国家拨给研究费。这样做，还可以使科学研究工作更好地结合生产实际。
    橡胶工业研究所每年的费用很大，去年国家拨给的研究费就达八十多万元。可是，这个所的试验工厂的许多新式机器利用率却很低。今年决定充分加以利用，除完成研究任务外，将生产一部分汽车轮胎和橡胶工业制品，并承做部分加工业务。这样，全年就可创造五百六十四万元的产值，获得的利润除抵补全所的开支外，还可有结余。这样国家今年准备拨给的科学研究费用八十六万元，可以全部不要。
