Comrades Deputies:

Only a little over half a year has passed since the conclusion of the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress. In this short period, tremendous and profound changes have taken place in the domestic and international situation.

In the second half of 1957, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, our people repelled the frenzied attacks of the bourgeois rightists and, based on Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, victoriously launched a vigorous nationwide rectification campaign. In 1957, our people completed and overfulfilled the first Five-Year Plan for socialist construction, laying a preliminary foundation for national industrialization. Now, the continuing in-depth rectification movement is bringing the people of the whole country a booming great leap forward in production and an unprecedented new atmosphere in all aspects of work. Compared with the situation in the first half of 1957, everyone can see that the vigorously rising socialist spirit in our country has overwhelmed the once rampant capitalist evil spirit, and the people of the whole country are forging ahead on the road of socialist construction with a spirit of riding the wind and waves. (Warm applause)

In the past six months or so, the international situation has also undergone decisive changes that are beneficial to our socialist construction, beneficial to the socialist camp, and beneficial to world peace and the cause of human progress. As everyone knows, in October and November of 1957, the Soviet Union launched two artificial earth satellites; during the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and other countries held meetings in Moscow and issued two declarations of great historical significance, embodying the unity of communist and workers' parties of all countries. This has brought about a new change in the advantage of socialist forces over imperialist forces and the advantage of peace forces over war forces, which had already existed, and brought the world situation to a new turning point. Now, as Chairman Mao Zedong said, in the international situation, it is not the West wind prevailing over the East wind, but the East wind prevailing over the West wind. (Prolonged and enthusiastic applause)

In 1956, imperialist aggressor groups took advantage of the opportunity when our socialist countries were correcting errors in their work and overcoming difficulties in their progress, and stirred up a frantic anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people countercurrent around the world. They launched an armed counterrevolutionary riot in Hungary, attempting to open a breach in Hungary and then defeat other socialist countries one by one. They incited national chauvinism, encouraged all kinds of revisionism, and tried to undermine the foundations of socialist countries and the unity of socialist countries. They were so carried away that they clamored that the crisis of the collapse of socialist countries had begun, and that socialist countries had encountered insurmountable difficulties. The anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people countercurrent stirred up by imperialism caused the bourgeois rightists in our country to have illusions, thinking that there was an opportunity to take advantage of, and at the same time, some people with unclear understanding in the ranks of the communist movement once wavered about the future of communism.

However, the dark cloud that appeared in the sky of socialist countries did not last long. The Hungarian people, with the internationalist assistance of the Soviet Union, repelled the imperialist offensive. The socialist camp also learned profound and beneficial lessons from the Hungarian incident. After a series of bilateral and multilateral talks, the relations between socialist countries have been continuously strengthened and improved. The meeting of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and other countries held in Moscow brought this development to a new peak. The declaration of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries summarized the experience of the international communist movement in the past 100 years, especially in the past 40 years. It pointed out the path to strengthen the unity of socialist countries on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism; at the same time, it also pointed out the path to strengthen unity with all forces that can be united in the cause of striving for world peace and human progress. The Moscow meeting ushered in a new stage in the unity of socialist countries and the international unity of the communist movement. (Warm applause)

The imperialist camp is accustomed to boasting about its advantages in science and technology and industrial production. However, the Soviet Union first successfully launched far superior artificial earth satellites, showing that the Soviet Union has definitely surpassed the United States in many important scientific and technological fields. In terms of industrial production, the Soviet Union is confidently striving to catch up with and surpass the United States in the output of various most important products within fifteen years. The Chinese people are also striving to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer. Other socialist countries will undoubtedly make great progress in developing industrial and agricultural production during the same period. In this way, within a short historical period, people will see that not only in the speed of industrial and agricultural development, but also in terms of production volume, the socialist camp will leave the imperialist camp far behind. This is the inevitable result of the superiority of the socialist system. (Warm applause)

Our socialist countries have always advocated peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between countries with different social systems. We have never used and will never use our advantages to threaten others. On the contrary, precisely because we have the advantage, we are working more actively for peace, and we are more convinced that we will win in peaceful competition. Since December 1957, the Soviet government has successively put forward many major peace proposals, fully demonstrating the Soviet Union's consistent position of safeguarding peace, and also expressing the sincere peace aspirations of our socialist countries. The Soviet government suggested: holding a summit meeting with the participation of Eastern and Western countries as well as some countries that do not participate in military blocs and pursue a peaceful policy, such as India, Afghanistan, Egypt, Yugoslavia, Sweden, and Austria; immediately ceasing the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons; realizing the proposal put forward by Poland and supported by Czechoslovakia and Democratic Germany to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe; the member states of the Warsaw Treaty and the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization signing a treaty of non-aggression; guaranteeing the independence and peace of the countries in the Middle East; and so on. The Chinese government fully supports these proposals. These peace proposals are increasingly popular and have greatly enhanced the political and moral prestige of socialist countries. (Applause)

Now, everyone can see that compared with the imperialist camp, our socialist camp has definitely gained the upper hand in terms of population and popular support, the speed of industrial and agricultural development, and some important science and technology. Even imperialist aggressors cannot but admit that what stands before them is a socialist camp led by the Soviet Union that is more powerful, more united, and forever invincible than in the past. (Prolonged and enthusiastic applause)

The existence of a strong socialist camp and its powerful support for national independence movements have encouraged all people who are striving for and safeguarding their freedom and independence, providing them with increasingly favorable conditions for carrying out heroic struggles against imperialism and colonialism.

Taking advantage of the failure of Britain, France, and Israel in the war of aggression against Egypt, the United States put forward the Eisenhower Doctrine to fill the "vacuum" in the Middle East and Africa, attempting to seize the colonial positions of Britain and France and suppress the national independence movements of the countries in this region. The deceptive nature of the Eisenhower Doctrine once caused illusions for some people. The US conspiracy gained a temporary upper hand in Jordan, and then the US carried out subversion activities against Syria. After these activities were repelled by the Syrian people, the US instigated Turkey to carry out armed threats against Syria, causing the Middle East situation to once again fall into a very tense state. However, just as the British and French aggressors underestimated the resistance of the Egyptian people, the US aggressor group underestimated the unity of the heroic Syrian people and other Arab countries, and underestimated their determination to safeguard national independence. The US aggressor group also obviously did not sufficiently estimate the firm support of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries and people for the Arab people. As everyone knows, under the strong opposition of the people of the world, the US conspiracy to invade Syria suffered a shameful defeat. We cheer for another great victory of the Arab people. (Warm applause)

Recently, Egypt and Syria announced the establishment of the United Arab Republic. We warmly congratulate the establishment of this new country, and sincerely hope that the United Arab Republic will rely on the patriotic and democratic forces of Egypt and Syria, powerfully promote the strengthening of unity among Arab countries, defeat all conspiracies to split the Arab people, and achieve greater victories in the common struggle to safeguard national independence and oppose colonialism. (Warm applause)

Facts have proved that the general trend of the vigorous development of national independence movements is irresistible. In the past six months, the people of the Middle East and Africa, especially the people of Yemen, Algeria, Morocco Ifni, and Oman, have carried out unremitting heroic struggles against colonialism, winning the sympathy and support of peace-loving countries around the world.

During this period, in Southeast Asia, the national independence movement has made great progress. The Federation of Malaya has been proclaimed, although this is only the first step towards its complete independence. Singapore is also striving to achieve independent status in the shortest possible time. Our friendly neighbor Indonesia has launched a struggle to recover West Irian, completely get rid of colonial economic control, and safeguard national sovereignty and independence. Imperialism hopes to rely on carrying out division and subversion activities within Indonesia and creating economic difficulties to force Indonesia to submit. US imperialism pretends to be neutral, but actually plays a leading role in these conspiracies. It is very obvious that the United States is trying to take the place of the Netherlands. The conspiracies of imperialism are emerging one after another, and the struggle of the Indonesian people will be long-term and tortuous. However, we believe that as long as all patriotic and democratic forces in Indonesia, as President Sukarno has repeatedly called for, unite in the cause of safeguarding national sovereignty and independence, and persist in the struggle, the conspiracies of imperialism will surely fail, and the struggle of the Indonesian people will surely be victorious. The Chinese people and the Chinese government will do everything in their power to unswervingly support the just struggle of the Indonesian people. (Warm applause)

In the context of the victorious development of the Asian-African national independence movement, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was held in Cairo with the participation of nearly fifty countries. Asian socialist countries actively participated in this conference, and countries with different social systems carried out good cooperation in the conference. Most of the countries participating in the conference came from Africa, showing that the vast African people have stepped onto the international political stage. The representatives of Asian and African countries included an extremely wide range of social strata, indicating that the movement to strive for national independence and safeguard world peace has increasingly become a people's movement in Asian and African countries. The Cairo Conference made important resolutions on the immediate problems of the Asian and African people and major international issues. The conference reaffirmed the firm support of the Asian and African people for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, and suggested that Asian and African countries carry out extensive cooperation in economic, cultural, and other fields. The conference called for an immediate end to nuclear weapons testing, and believed that Asia and Africa should be peace zones, and foreign countries should not deploy nuclear weapons and rocket weapons in this region. The conference strongly condemned the various conspiratorial activities of imperialism as the root cause of human disasters, and specifically pointed out that the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine are interfering in the independence of Arab countries, undermining their sovereignty, and endangering their security. The conference firmly advocated that the people of all countries enjoy the sacred rights of freedom, self-determination, sovereignty, and independence. These resolutions undoubtedly expressed the common voice of hundreds of millions of people in Asia and Africa. Although the Asian-African national independence movement is still a long-term struggle, and its development will inevitably have twists and turns, the people of Asia and Africa have stood up and can no longer be suppressed. (Prolonged and enthusiastic applause)

The United States put forward the Eisenhower Doctrine for only a short year, and this doctrine has suffered a shameful defeat, and its aggressive nature has been fully exposed. Among the people of Asia and Africa, this doctrine has become notorious. Now the US aggressor group is still trying to continue its aggression and war conspiracies through the Baghdad Pact and the Manila Treaty, but under the firm opposition of the strong socialist camp and the awakened Asian and African people, the new conspiracies of US imperialism will also only have a future of failure. (Applause)

Contrary to the prosperous and united situation of socialist countries, the imperialist camp is facing serious economic recession and political crisis.

Since the second half of 1957, there has been a general phenomenon of declining production and increasing unemployment in the United States, Britain, France, and some other Western countries. As signs of economic recession become increasingly obvious, the struggle for markets becomes more intense. As has happened in previous capitalist economic recessions, every capitalist country tries to shift the burden of the economic recession to other countries. This makes the contradictions within the imperialist camp more acute and profound.

Faced with the increasingly serious economic recession, the United States is trying to use its superior position in the imperialist camp to intensify its control, interference, and plunder of its allied countries. This cannot but arouse greater resistance from the allies of the United States, and expand their centrifugal tendency towards the United States. In order to blackmail and control its allies, the United States is accustomed to fabricating the so-called threat of socialist countries, and has consistently boasted about the strength of the United States and its superior position of being immune to attacks, as if its allies need "protection" and only the United States can "protect" them. However, the allies of the United States have increasingly seen clearly that the real threat to them is the economic consequences of following the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war, and the damage to their sovereignty and interests by the United States in the name of "protection." When the Soviet Union surpassed the United States in some important science and technology fields and mastered intercontinental missiles, the United States' capital for blackmailing its allies was declared bankrupt, and the myth about the so-called "strength" and "superior position" of the United States was also shattered. Although the United States has put forward the slogan of so-called "interdependence" in an attempt to maintain and strengthen its control over its allies, the allies of the United States cannot but seriously consider that the United States is not a reliable backer, and that continuing the arms race with the rapid development of various weapons can have no other future for them than economic bankruptcy, and allowing their territories to become missile bases of the United States can only make themselves the first to be destroyed in the event of a war provoked by the United States. The broad masses of people in the allies of the United States are increasingly strongly opposed to the heavy burden of military spending, to the deployment of missiles by the United States on their territories, and to the flight of US aircraft carrying nuclear weapons in their airspace. This cannot but make the governments of these countries maintain a relatively sober mind on the issue of peace and war.

The policy of peaceful coexistence consistently pursued by socialist countries, especially the major peace proposals recently put forward by the Soviet Union, further exposed the lies fabricated by the US aggressor group about the so-called threat of socialist countries. More and more capitalist countries are increasingly deeply aware that in the current international situation, peaceful coexistence with socialist countries is not only possible, but also necessary. However, the US aggressor group and its very few followers insist on expanding armaments and preparing for war, refusing to ease international tensions, and trying to obstruct negotiations between the East and the West on the most urgent international issues. This further expands the differences between the United States and its allied countries.

At the recent Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the internal contradictions of Western countries developed to an extent that could not be concealed. The United States originally wanted to strengthen the Western countries' expansion of armaments and preparations for war through the Paris meeting, and deploy nuclear weapons and rocket weapons bases on the territories of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, the development of the meeting was contrary to the US's plan. At this meeting, Norway and Denmark openly refused to establish US missile bases on their territories, and many other countries also showed hesitation on this issue due to pressure from their domestic people. The peace proposals of the Soviet government aroused great interest and lengthy discussions at the meeting. The communique of the meeting, on the one hand, promoted the expansion of armaments and preparations for war, trying to aggravate international tensions, but on the other hand, in order to cope with domestic and international pressure, it also had to leave room for negotiations between the East and the West. After the meeting, even Britain expressed its agreement in principle to the conclusion of a treaty of non-aggression between the relevant countries, although whether it can adhere to this proposition remains to be seen.

Now, the problem facing the US aggressor group and its followers is very clear: if they are stubborn, refuse peaceful coexistence, and continue to pursue the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, they will become more isolated in the world and bring upon themselves a more serious political crisis and economic crisis; if they dare to take risks and attempt to find a way out from war, then they will be digging their own graves and seeking their own destruction. Now is the time for them to conduct a cool-headed consideration and make a wise choice. (Laughter and applause)

The people of all countries in the world yearn for peace. The favorable international situation and the various peace proposals put forward by the Soviet government have encouraged the confidence of all peace-loving countries and people in striving for peace. Our government and the governments of other brotherly countries have successively expressed their support for the various proposals of the Soviet government. China is prepared to work together with other countries to make active efforts to realize these proposals and assume corresponding obligations. Our great neighbor India has always been concerned about world peace and international security, and has given active support to the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a summit meeting of Eastern and Western countries. Based on his basic idea of expanding peace zones, Prime Minister Nehru opposed the establishment of missile bases in Europe and Asia, and advocated the establishment and expansion of zones without weapons of mass destruction. This proposition has always been supported by the Chinese people. Egypt has also clearly expressed its welcome to the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a summit meeting with the participation of Egypt. Now, the movement calling for an immediate summit meeting between the East and the West has sprung up all over the world, and the various peace proposals of the Soviet Union have become a huge driving force for promoting the easing of the international situation and promoting peaceful coexistence among all countries. Although the US aggressor group and its followers are still unwilling to abandon the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, and are still creating various excuses to set up obstacles to negotiations between the East and the West, their days of being able to do whatever they want and command as they please in international politics are long gone. Today, the forces for safeguarding peace in the world are unprecedentedly strong, and the conditions for striving for lasting world peace are also unprecedentedly favorable. As long as all peace-loving countries and people, like in the past, strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, they will be able to promote the continued development of the international situation in a direction conducive to peace, and force the imperialist aggressive forces to accept peaceful coexistence. (Applause)

Our country has regarded safeguarding peace as its sacred duty since the day it was founded. We are a member of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. Strengthening the strength and unity of this camp is our primary international obligation in safeguarding peace. In the past six months, in our relations with socialist countries, the first thing that should be mentioned is Chairman Mao's leading the delegation of the People's Republic of China to Moscow to participate in the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This is another major event in Sino-Soviet relations after the visit to China by Chairman Voroshilov of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. (Applause) During this period, we also received the Hungarian government delegation headed by Prime Minister Kadar, the Bulgarian government delegation headed by Chairman Yugov, and the Vice Chairman of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia, Vukmanovic. In response to the visit of the delegation of the National People's Congress of our country, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia sent parliamentary delegations to visit our country. When the people of our country warmly celebrated the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the delegation of all circles of the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Andreev, Chairman of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, also came to our country to participate in the celebration. We have also sent various professional delegations to each other with various brotherly countries to strengthen mutual learning and cooperation. It should be especially mentioned here that the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement signed in January 1958. The Soviet Union will provide huge assistance to the development of science and technology in our country through this agreement. The development of relations between our country and various socialist countries in the past six months typically embodies the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation in the socialist family. (Warm applause)

We are the country that first initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence together with India and Burma. In the past six months, the relations between our country and Asian and African nationalist countries have achieved great development, providing more vivid examples for the practice of the Five Principles. Through the visits of leaders and well-known people of many countries to our country, we have had frequent opportunities to contact them and enhance mutual understanding and friendship. During this period, we received Indian Vice President Dr. Radhakrishnan, Afghan Prime Minister Daoud, former Indonesian Vice President Dr. Hatta and Speaker of Parliament Sadono, Burmese Chief Justice Wu Min Deng, Deputy Prime Ministers Wu Ba Rui and Wu Jue Ying, and parliamentary delegation, and Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Prince Badr. Prince Badr was the first leader of an Arab country to visit our country. During his visit, China and Yemen signed a treaty of friendship, a treaty of commerce, and an agreement on scientific, technological, and cultural cooperation. This is of great significance for strengthening the relationship between China and Yemen and further developing the relationship between China and all Arab countries. In addition to friendly visits, we have also further developed mutual learning and cooperation in professional aspects with Asian and African countries. This is particularly important for Asian and African countries that are relatively backward in economic, cultural, and scientific and technological aspects.

In the past six months, although the current Japanese government has adopted an unfriendly attitude towards the New China in many aspects, and although the fourth Sino-Japanese non-governmental trade agreement has not been signed because the Japanese government attempted to impose unreasonable restrictions and insulting regulations on the Chinese side, the exchanges and trade relations between the people of China and Japan have still been greatly developed, reflecting the common desire of the people of the two countries for peace and friendship. During this period, among the foreign guests visiting China from Asian and African countries, Japanese friends were still the most numerous, and China also sent many important delegations to visit Japan. The Chinese people thank the Japanese people and organizations for their reception and assistance to various Chinese delegations. The Chinese people are happy to see the exhibition of Japanese commodities in Guangzhou, and congratulate it on its success. (Applause)

We have always advocated that all countries in the world should resolve their problems with each other through consultation. The treaty on the issue of dual nationality signed between our country and Indonesia is an example. This treaty has recently been approved by the Indonesian Parliament and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country one after another, and will take effect soon. In accordance with the principles approved by the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress, our government continued to conduct friendly consultations with the Burmese government on the border issue. We have no doubt that Burma will work with us to jointly resolve this issue in a spirit of mutual respect and mutual understanding.

In the past six months, our relationship with the Nordic countries has been satisfactory. The delegation of the National People's Congress of our country paid a return visit to Finland and received a warm reception. Our country has signed trade agreements with Finland, Sweden, and Denmark, and has also made contact with Norway on trade issues.

During this period, some major countries in Western Europe also showed a strong interest in developing trade and technical cooperation with China. The Undersecretary of the British Department of Trade and civilian economic delegations from France and West Germany have visited China one after another. We welcome this desire for cooperation, and have also sent delegations to Britain, France, Austria, and Belgium to study the possibility of developing trade and technical cooperation with these countries. However, it must be pointed out that the continuation of the embargo against China will inevitably greatly limit this possibility. In the past six months, one phenomenon worth mentioning is that US youth representatives came to China to visit despite the obstruction and intimidation of the US State Department. They had the opportunity to compare their personal experiences with the smear propaganda of the US State Department. After contact with the Chinese people, they also found that the people of China and the United States have broad common ground in terms of peace and friendship.

Since the Korean armistice, China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have continuously taken active steps to transform the state of armistice in Korea into lasting peace and realize the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the United States has adopted a completely opposite attitude. It has not only tried its best to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, but also openly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement. Last June, the United States unilaterally announced the abolition of the provision in the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the prohibition of the import of reinforcing weapons. In the past six months, the United States, disregarding the protests of the Chinese and Korean sides, has transported new weapons such as atomic artillery and missiles into South Korea, and recently even held so-called "atomic strike" exercises near the military demarcation line. The US is doing this, on the one hand, to continue to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and on the other hand, to aggravate the tense situation in the Far East, so as to facilitate the strengthening of colonial rule over the people of South Korea and further turn South Korea into an atomic base of the United States. This proves that the presence of US troops in South Korea is a threat to the Korean people and also a threat to peace in the Far East. The Korean people and the Chinese people cannot allow this situation to continue.

In order to realize the peaceful reunification of Korea, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea recently suggested: withdrawing all foreign troops from both North and South Korea at the same time; holding free elections in the whole of Korea under the supervision of neutral country organizations regularly after all foreign troops have been withdrawn; North and South Korea consulting on an equal basis to discuss economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea and the elections in the whole of Korea; North and South Korea reducing their troops to the minimum in the near future. These major proposals of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea not only meet the deep aspirations of the entire Korean people, but also provide a new and realistic way to gradually ease the tense situation in the Far East. The Chinese government fully supports the proposals of the Korean government, believes that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea regularly, and has stated that it is prepared to consult with the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. The Chinese government requires the US government and the governments of other countries participating in the UN forces to take similar measures to withdraw US troops and all other foreign troops from South Korea. (Prolonged and enthusiastic applause)

The Chinese government has always believed that the Korean issue should only be resolved by the Korean people themselves, and any interference by external forces is not allowed. As everyone knows, the Chinese people organized volunteers to go to Korea to resist US aggression and aid Korea only after US troops invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and at the same time occupied our territory Taiwan and seriously threatened our security. The Chinese People's Volunteers are just, they are resisting aggression, and their nature is completely different from that of the US aggressive army. After the Korean armistice, the Chinese side, together with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, continuously proposed to the US side the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea. This is the key to holding free elections in the whole of Korea and realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the US side has always rejected the proposals of the Chinese and Korean sides. This has created the current stalemate in Korea. In order to break this stalemate and promote peace in the Far East, the Chinese government responded to the proposal of the Korean government again to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, and is prepared to take proactive measures to promote the realization of this proposal. We believe that the time has come for all parties concerned to take active steps, work together, and promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. (Prolonged and enthusiastic applause)

As a participating country in the Geneva Accords and a close neighbor of the Indochinese countries, China has always been concerned about the consolidation of peace in Indochina and the full implementation of the Geneva Accords. The Chinese government fully supports the unremitting efforts made by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to promote the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and believes that the current situation in which the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam is obstructed and sabotaged should not continue. The establishment of the coalition government of the Kingdom of Laos and the settlement of the issues in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly mark that significant progress has been made in the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos. The Chinese government welcomes the realization of peaceful unification in the Kingdom of Laos on the basis of the Geneva Accords. The peaceful unification of Laos provides more favorable conditions for the independent development of Laos. Although the United States has not given up its attempts to drag Laos into the Manila Treaty Group, Laos, like Cambodia, continues to follow a policy of peace and neutrality. In recent years, the relationship between China and Cambodia has had a good development. The Chinese government will also strive to develop good-neighborly relations between China and Laos based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence established in the 1956 joint statement of the Chinese Premier and the Laotian Prime Minister. (Applause)

Now, I will talk about Sino-US relations.

It has been two and a half years since the Sino-US ambassadorial talks began in August 1955. Although China has put forward a series of positive suggestions on the issue of easing the tension in the Taiwan region, the United States has always insisted on China recognizing the status quo of the US occupation of Taiwan and maintaining the tension in the Taiwan region. This has made it impossible for the talks to make any progress on the main issues in Sino-US relations. In order to gradually improve Sino-US relations starting with issues that are relatively easy to solve, and to create favorable conditions for the solution of the main issues between China and the United States, the Chinese side has made many efforts. In the past six months, the Chinese side has again successively suggested: The governments of China and the United States should allow reporters from the other side to conduct interviews on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and the two governments should negotiate on judicial assistance between China and the United States. Anyone can see that these are suggestions to solve some practical problems, these suggestions are fair and reasonable, and they are beneficial to both sides. As long as there is sincerity to improve relations, there should be no difficulty in reaching an agreement on these issues. However, the US government rejected these suggestions almost without consideration. The issues of reporter interviews and judicial assistance were originally raised to China by US reporters and US judicial authorities. The Chinese government is willing to see these wishes of the relevant parties in the United States can be realized. However, before the US government changes its rigid and hostile attitude, the unilateral efforts of the Chinese government are in vain.

The US insistence on China recognizing the status quo of its occupation of Taiwan in the Sino-US talks is inseparable from its conspiracy to create "two Chinas".

The United States openly occupied Taiwan while launching a war of aggression against Korea and intensifying interference in Indochina. The US ruling group is not reconciled to their failure on the Chinese mainland, and attempts to strangle the young People's Republic of China from three aspects: Korea, Indochina, and Taiwan. However, after several years of serious contests, the Korean War stopped, peace in Indochina was restored, New China is developing and growing day by day, and the possibility of the Chinese people liberating Taiwan is growing day by day. The US policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, non-recognition of New China, and exclusion of New China from international life not only cannot harm the existence and development of New China in the slightest, but instead puts the United States itself in an increasingly isolated position. In order to get rid of this predicament and at the same time to continue to occupy Taiwan, the United States is trying to create "two Chinas".

The United States is holding ambassadorial talks with China, but in the talks, it requires China to recognize the status quo of its occupation of Taiwan. In essence, this is an attempt to create "two Chinas", and the Chinese side certainly cannot allow it. In the United Nations, the US obstruction of the restoration of China's legitimate rights is meeting with increasing opposition, and it also realizes that it is impossible to permanently exclude China from the United Nations. Therefore, the current approach of the United States is to first create a "two Chinas" situation as much as possible in some international conferences and international organizations, so as to gradually form an established fact of "two Chinas" internationally. As early as the 16th Olympic Games in November 1956 and the special committee of the International Geophysical Year in June 1957, the United States had already conducted this conspiratorial activity through its followers. By the 19th International Red Cross Conference held in New Delhi in October 1957 with the participation of eighty countries, the United States personally came forward to carry out the conspiratorial activity of creating "two Chinas". At this meeting, the US representative insisted on inviting the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan to send a so-called delegation of the Republic of China to attend the conference at the same time as the delegation of the People's Republic of China. Although the US proposal was passed by a majority of sixty-two votes in favor to forty-four votes against, among the total number of one hundred and thirty-five votes, only a minority supported the US proposal, while the majority supported China's just position against the creation of "two Chinas" in various forms. (Applause) The despicable conspiracy of the United States aroused public outrage at the conference. The delegations of all socialist countries, many Asian and African countries, and Nordic countries took united action with the Chinese delegation, withdrew from the meeting, and expressed strong protest; (Warm applause) Some delegations from other countries remained in the meeting and continued to struggle against the US proposal. This put the United States in a very isolated position politically and morally.

However, it should also be pointed out that the United States is not without followers in its conspiracy to create "two Chinas". Some people attempt to create an objective situation of "two Chinas" in some international organizations and international conferences by retaining representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek group on the one hand and inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate on the other hand. Of course, there are indeed friends who are friendly to China in this, and they naively believe that doing so can bring New China into international organizations and international activities, but they do not know that they are actually being deceived by the United States' conspiracy to create a "two Chinas" situation. Some people deliberately spread the fallacy that the status of Taiwan is undetermined and that the residents of Taiwan are not Han Chinese, advocating so-called referendums in Taiwan, implementing so-called Taiwanese autonomy, and even putting Taiwan under trusteeship, opening the way for the US conspiracy to create "two Chinas". Taiwan is Chinese territory. The Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation both recognized that Taiwan should be returned to China. In fact, Taiwan has already been returned to China after Japan's surrender. Even the Chiang Kai-shek group cannot deny these facts. Even the US government, which is currently actively creating "two Chinas", has repeatedly confirmed these facts. The vast majority of the population of Taiwan is Han Chinese, and the ethnic minorities there, like other ethnic minorities on the Chinese mainland, are members of the big family of the Chinese nation. The fallacies about the status of Taiwan and the Taiwanese nation are completely unfounded. All conspiracies to make Taiwan secede from the motherland by creating these fallacies can never be realized. (Prolonged and enthusiastic applause)

The British government recognizes the People's Republic of China on the one hand, but on the other hand, it assists the United States in supporting the Chiang Kai-shek group in the United Nations to steal China's seat. At the same time, Britain is also the center of spreading the fallacy that the status of Taiwan is undetermined. Recently, the collusion between the British government and the Chiang Kai-shek group has significantly increased. China is willing to improve relations with Britain, but it will never acquiesce in or tolerate Britain following the United States to create "two Chinas". If Britain does not change its two-sided attitude towards China, the Sino-British relationship will inevitably be adversely affected.

The movement of the Japanese people demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations has become an increasingly strong force that

    目前国际形势和我国外交政策
    1958年2月10日在第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议上的讲话
    国务院总理　周恩来各位代表：
    从第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议结束到现在，不过半年多的时间。在这不长的时间里，国内外的形势却发生了巨大的、深刻的变化。
    在一九五七年下半年，我国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下击退了资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻，并且根据毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的光辉指示胜利地开展了生气蓬勃的全民整风运动。在一九五七年，我国人民完成和超额完成了社会主义建设的第一个五年计划，奠定了国家工业化的初步基础。现在，继续深入的整风运动正为全国人民带来热火朝天的生产大跃进和各方面工作中空前未有的新气象。同一九五七年上半年的情况相比，大家都可以看到，在我们的国家里蓬勃上升的社会主义正气已经压倒了一度猖獗的资本主义邪气，全国人民都在用乘风破浪的气概在社会主义建设的大道上兼程迈进。（热烈鼓掌）
    在这半年多的时间里，国际形势也发生了有利于我国社会主义建设、有利于社会主义阵营、有利于世界和平和人类进步事业的决定性的变化。大家知道，在一九五七年的十月和十一月，苏联发射了两颗人造地球卫星；在庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，社会主义国家和其它国家的共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科举行了会议，发表了具有伟大历史意义的两项宣言，体现了各国共产党和工人党的团结一致。这就使得早已存在的社会主义力量对帝国主义力量的优势，和平力量对战争力量的优势，发生了一个新的变化，使世界形势达到了一个新的转折点。现在，正如毛泽东主席所说的，在国际形势中，不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    一九五六年，帝国主义侵略集团利用我们社会主义国家纠正自己工作中的错误和克服前进中的困难的机会，在全世界掀起了一股疯狂的反苏、反共、反人民的逆流。他们在匈牙利发动了反革命的武装暴乱，企图在匈牙利打开缺口，然后对其它社会主义国家各个击破。他们煽动民族沙文主义，鼓励各式各样的修正主义，力图破坏社会主义国家的基础和社会主义各国的团结。他们得意忘形地叫嚣，说什么社会主义国家崩溃的危机已经开始，社会主义国家已经遇到不可克服的困难。帝国主义掀起的反苏、反共、反人民的逆流，使我国的资产阶级右派发生错觉，以为有机可乘，同时，共产主义运动的队伍里有些认识不清的人，也一度对共产主义的前途发生动摇。
    但是，在社会主义国家的天空上出现的一片乌云并没有维持多久。匈牙利人民在苏联的国际主义的援助下，击退了帝国主义的进攻。社会主义阵营各国也从匈牙利事件中吸取了深刻有益的教训。经过了一系列的双边和多边的会谈，社会主义国家之间的关系不断地得到加强和改进。在莫斯科举行的社会主义国家和其它国家的共产党和工人党的会议把这种发展推向了新的高峰。社会主义国家共产党和工人党的宣言总结了近一百年、特别是近四十年国际共产主义运动的经验。它指出了在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上加强社会主义各国团结的道路；同时，还指出了在争取世界和平和人类进步的事业中同一切可以团结的力量加强团结的道路。莫斯科会议使社会主义国家的团结和共产主义运动的国际团结开始了一个新的阶段。（热烈鼓掌）
    帝国主义阵营惯于夸耀它们在科学技术和工业生产方面的优势。但是，苏联首先成功地发射出远为优良的人造地球卫星，表现出苏联在许多重要的科学技术方面已经确定地超过了美国。在工业生产方面，苏联正满怀信心地要在十五年内在各种最重要的产品的产量上赶上和超过美国。中国人民也争取在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其它重要的工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国。其它的社会主义国家在同一期间在发展工农业生产方面，无疑地也将取得很大的进展。这样，在一个短短的历史时期内，人们将会看到，不仅在工农业发展的速度方面，而且在生产量方面，社会主义阵营都要把帝国主义阵营远远地抛在后面。这是社会主义制度优越性的必然的结果。（热烈鼓掌）
    我们社会主义国家从来就是主张社会制度不同的国家和平共处、和平竞赛的。我们从来没有、也绝不会利用我们的优势来威胁别人。相反地，正是因为我们掌握了优势，我们更加积极地为和平而努力，我们更加深信不疑，我们将在和平竞赛中取得胜利。自从一九五七年十二月以来，苏联政府连续地提出许多重大的和平建议，充分地证明了苏联一贯维护和平的立场，同时也表达了我们社会主义国家真诚的和平愿望。苏联政府建议：举行有东西方国家以及一些不参加军事集团和执行和平政策的国家如印度、阿富汗、埃及、南斯拉夫、瑞典、奥地利等国参加的最高级会议；立即停止原子武器和氢武器的试验；实现波兰提出的、捷克斯洛伐克和民主德国支持的在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议；华沙条约成员国和北大西洋公约成员国签订互不侵犯条约；保证中近东地区各国的独立和和平；等等。中国政府完全支持这些建议。这些和平建议日益深入人心，大大地提高了社会主义国家在政治上和道义上的威望。（鼓掌）
    现在，大家都可以看到，同帝国主义阵营相比，我们社会主义阵营在人口众多和人心归向方面，在工农业发展速度和若干重要的科学技术方面，已经肯定地占了优势。就是帝国主义侵略者也不能不承认，站在他们面前的是一个比过去更加强大、更加团结和永远不可战胜的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    一个强大的社会主义阵营的存在和它对于民族独立运动强有力的支持，鼓舞了一切争取和维护自己的自由和独立的人民，为他们胜利地进行反对帝国主义和殖民主义的英勇斗争提供了日益有利的条件。
    美国利用英、法、以色列在侵略埃及战争中的失败，提出在中近东和非洲填补“真空”的艾森豪威尔主义，企图夺取英法的殖民地位，镇压这个地区各国人民的民族独立运动。艾森豪威尔主义的欺骗性曾经引起了某些人的幻想。美国的阴谋在约旦取得了暂时的上风，接着美国又对叙利亚进行颠覆活动。当这些活动被叙利亚人民击退以后，美国就策动土耳其对叙利亚进行武装威胁，使中近东形势再度陷于十分紧张的状态。但是，正如英法侵略者低估了埃及人民的抵抗一样，美国侵略集团低估了英勇的叙利亚人民和其它阿拉伯各国人民的团结，低估了他们维护民族独立的决心。美国侵略集团显然也没有足够地估计到苏联和其它爱好和平的国家和人民对于阿拉伯人民的坚决支持。大家知道，在世界人民的强烈反对之下，美国侵略叙利亚的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。我们欢呼阿拉伯人民的又一次伟大胜利。（热烈鼓掌）
    最近，埃及和叙利亚宣布建立阿拉伯联合共和国。我们热烈地庆贺这个新国家的成立，并且衷心地希望阿拉伯联合共和国将依靠埃及和叙利亚的爱国民主力量，有力地推动阿拉伯各国加强团结，击破一切分裂阿拉伯人民的阴谋，在维护民族独立和反对殖民主义的共同斗争中取得更大的胜利。（热烈鼓掌）
    事实证明，民族独立运动蓬勃发展的总趋势是不可阻挡的。半年来，中近东和非洲各国人民，特别是也门、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥伊夫尼、阿曼的人民进行了再接再厉的反对殖民主义的英勇斗争，赢得了爱好和平各国人民的同情和支持。
    这个期间，在东南亚，民族独立运动有了很大的进展。马来亚联合邦已经宣告成立，虽然这还是它走向完全独立的第一步。新加坡也正争取在最短期间内取得独立地位。我国的友好邻邦印度尼西亚展开了收复西伊里安、彻底摆脱殖民主义的经济控制、维护国家主权和独立的斗争。帝国主义指望依靠在印度尼西亚内部进行分裂和颠覆活动、制造经济困难来逼使印度尼西亚屈服。美国帝国主义伪装中立，实际上在这些阴谋中起着主导作用。很明显，美国是企图取荷兰的地位而代之。帝国主义的阴谋是层出不穷的，印度尼西亚人民的斗争将是长期的和曲折的。但是，我们相信，只要印度尼西亚的一切爱国民主力量，像苏加诺总统一再号召的那样，在维护国家主权和独立的事业中团结一致，坚持斗争，帝国主义的阴谋是一定要失败的，印度尼西亚人民的斗争是一定要胜利的。中国人民和中国政府将尽一切力量始终不渝地支持印度尼西亚人民的这一正义斗争。（热烈鼓掌）
    在亚非民族独立运动胜利开展的情况下，在开罗举行了有将近五十个国家参加的亚非人民团结大会。亚洲社会主义国家积极地参加了这个会议，社会制度不同的国家在会议中进行了良好的合作。参加会议的国家多数来自非洲，显示出广大的非洲人民已经登上了国际政治舞台。亚非各国人民的代表包括了极其广泛的社会阶层，表明争取民族独立和维护世界和平的运动已经日益成为亚非各国的人民运动。开罗会议对于亚非人民的切身问题和重大的国际问题作出了重要的决议。会议重申亚非人民对于和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的坚决支持，并且建议亚非各国在经济、文化等方面进行广泛的合作。会议呼吁立即停止核武器试验，并且认为亚非应该是和平区，外国不应该在这个地区里配置核武器和火箭武器。会议强烈谴责帝国主义的各种阴谋活动是人类灾祸的根源，特别指出巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义是干涉阿拉伯国家独立、损害它们的主权和危及它们的安全的。会议坚决主张各国人民享有自由、自决、主权和独立的神圣权利。这些决议，无疑问地表达了亚非亿万人民的共同呼声。尽管亚非民族独立运动还是一个长期的斗争，它的发展还不可避免地会有曲折，但是，亚非人民已经站起来了，再也压不下去了。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    美国提出艾森豪威尔主义才不过是短短一年的时间，这个主义已经遭到可耻的失败，它的侵略实质已经暴露无遗。在亚非人民当中，这个主义已经臭了。现在美国侵略集团还在企图通过巴格达条约和马尼拉条约来继续进行它的侵略和战争阴谋，但是，在强大的社会主义阵营和觉醒的亚非人民的坚决反对之下，美帝国主义的新的阴谋同样地只有一个失败的前途。（鼓掌）
    同社会主义各国欣欣向荣和团结一致的情况相反，帝国主义阵营面临着严重的经济衰退和政治危机。
    从一九五七年下半年起，在美国、英国、法国和其它一些西方国家里出现了带有普遍性的生产下降和失业增加的现象。随着经济衰退的迹象日益明显，争夺市场的斗争更加激烈。像在过去历次资本主义经济衰退中所发生过的一样，每一个资本主义国家都力图把经济衰退的负担转嫁给其它国家。这就使帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾更加尖锐化和深刻化。
    面对着日益严重的经济衰退，美国力图利用它在帝国主义阵营的优越地位来加紧对它的同盟国家的控制、干涉和掠夺。这就不能不引起美国的同盟国家更大的反抗，扩大它们对美国的离心倾向。为了对它的盟国进行讹诈和控制，美国惯于捏造所谓社会主义国家的威胁，并且一贯吹嘘美国的实力和受不到攻击的优越地位，好像它的盟国需要“保护”，只有美国才能“保护”它们。但是，美国的盟国已经越来越看得清楚，对它们的真正威胁是追随美国扩军备战的经济后果和美国在“保护”的名义下对它们的主权和利益的损害。当苏联在某些重要的科学技术方面超过了美国，并且掌握了洲际导弹以后，美国对它的盟国进行讹诈的资本宣告破产，关于美国的所谓“实力”和“优越地位”的神话也归于破灭。尽管美国又提出了所谓“互相依赖”的口号，企图保持和加强对它的盟国的控制，但是，美国的盟国不能不认真地考虑到，美国靠山并不可靠，在各种武器日新月异的情况下继续军备竞赛，对它们来说除了经济破产以外不能有别的前途，容许它们的领土变为美国的导弹基地，也只能使自己在美国挑起战争的情况下首先遭到毁灭。美国的盟国中的广大人民日益强烈地反对沉重的军费负担，反对美国在他们的国土上配置导弹，反对带有核武器的美国飞机在他们的领空飞行。这也不能不使这些国家的政府在和平和战争的问题上保持较为清醒的头脑。
    社会主义国家一贯奉行的和平共处政策，特别是最近苏联提出的重大和平建议，进一步地揭穿了美国侵略集团捏造的所谓社会主义国家威胁的谎言。越来越多的资本主义国家日益深刻地认识到，在目前的国际形势下同社会主义国家和平共处，不仅是可能的，而且是必要的。但是，美国侵略集团和它的极少数的追随者却坚持扩军备战、拒绝和缓国际紧张局势，并且力图阻挠东西方就当前最紧迫的国际问题进行谈判。这就进一步扩大了美国和它的同盟国家之间的分歧。
    在北大西洋公约组织最近的巴黎会议上，西方国家的内部矛盾发展到了无法掩饰的程度。美国原来想通过巴黎会议加强西方国家的扩军备战，在北大西洋公约组织成员国的领土上配置核武器和火箭武器的基地。但是，会议的发展同美国的设想相反。在这个会议上，挪威和丹麦公开拒绝在它们的领土上建立美国的导弹基地，还有许多国家也因为国内人民的压力在这个问题上表现迟疑。苏联政府的和平建议在会上引起了很大的兴趣和长时间的讨论。会议的公报一方面宣扬扩军备战，力图加剧国际紧张局势，但是，另一方面为了应付国内外的压力，也不得不为东西方的谈判留下余地。在会议以后，甚至英国也表示在原则上赞成有关国家缔结互不侵犯条约，虽然它是否能坚持这个主张，还有待事实证明。
    现在，摆在美国侵略集团和它的追随者面前的问题已经很清楚：如果它们执迷不悟，拒绝和平共处，继续推行扩军备战政策，它们就会在世界上更加孤立，为自己招致更严重的政治危机和经济危机；如果它们竟敢挺而走险，企图从战争中寻找出路，那么，它们就是自掘坟墓，自取灭亡。现在是它们进行冷静的考虑和作出明智的抉择的时候了。（笑声和掌声）
      世界各国人民都渴望和平。有利的国际形势和苏联政府提出的各项和平建议，鼓舞了一切爱好和平的国家和人民争取和平的信心。我国政府和其他兄弟国家的政府都先后表示支持苏联政府的各项建议。中国准备同其它国家一起，为实现这些建议作出积极的努力并且承担相应的义务。我们伟大的邻邦印度一贯关怀世界和平和国际安全，对于苏联提出的召开东西方国家最高级会议的建议给予了积极的支持。尼赫鲁总理根据他关于扩大和平地区的基本思想，反对在欧洲和亚洲建立导弹基地，主张建立和扩大没有大规模毁灭性武器的地区。这种主张是中国人民所历来支持的。埃及也已经明确表示欢迎苏联关于召开有埃及参加的最高级会议的建议。现在，要求立即举行东西方最高级会议的运动已经在世界各地风起云涌，苏联的各项和平建议已经成为促进国际局势和缓、促进各国和平共处的巨大动力。尽管美国侵略集团和它的追随者还不肯放弃扩军备战的政策，还在制造各种借口为东西方谈判设立障碍，但是，他们在国际政治中可以为所欲为、可以指挥如意的日子早已过去了。今天，世界上维护和平的力量已经空前强大，争取世界持久和平的条件也空前有利。只要一切爱好和平的国家和人民，像过去那样，加强团结，坚持斗争，他们就能够推动国际形势继续朝着有利于和平的方向发展，并且迫使帝国主义侵略势力接受和平共处。（鼓掌）
    我们的国家从成立的那一天起就把保卫和平看作是自己的神圣职责。我们是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的成员。加强这个阵营的力量和团结是我们在保卫和平方面首要的国际义务。这半年来，在我们同社会主义各国的关系方面，首先应该提到的是毛主席率领中华人民共和国代表团前往莫斯科参加伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的庆祝。这是在苏联最高苏维埃主席团伏罗希洛夫主席访华以后，中苏关系中的又一件大事。（鼓掌）在这期间，我们也接待了以卡达尔总理为首的匈牙利政府代表团，以于哥夫主席为首的保加利亚政府代表团和南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会伏克曼诺维奇副主席。为了回答我国全国人民代表大会代表团的访问，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫都派出了议会代表团来我国访问。在我国人民热烈庆祝十月革命四十周年的时候，以苏联苏中友好协会主席安德烈耶夫同志为首的苏联各界代表团也来到我国参加庆祝。我们同各兄弟国家还互相派出了各种专业性的代表团，加强彼此的学习和合作。在这里应该特别提到中苏两国在一九五八年一月签订的科学技术合作协定。苏联将通过这个协定，对我国科学技术的发展，提供巨大的援助。半年来我国和各社会主义国家间关系的发展，典型地体现了在社会主义大家庭中团结一致、互助合作的精神。（热烈鼓掌）
    我们是同印度和缅甸一起首先倡议和平共处五项原则的国家。半年来，我国同亚非民族主义国家的关系获得了巨大的发展，替五项原则的实践提供了更多的生动事例。通过许多国家的领导人和知名人士对我国的访问，我们有频繁的机会同他们接触，增进彼此的了解和友谊。在这期间，我们接待了印度副总统拉达克里希南博士，阿富汗达乌德首相，印度尼西亚前副总统哈达博士和沙多诺议长，缅甸吴敏登首席法官、吴巴瑞、吴觉迎两位副总理和国会代表团，也门副首相巴德尔王太子。巴德尔王太子是来我国访问的第一个阿拉伯国家领导人。在他访问期间，中国和也门签订了友好条约、商务条约和关于科学、技术和文化合作的协定。这对于加强中国和也门的关系和进一步发展中国和所有阿拉伯国家的关系具有重大的意义。我们同亚非国家除了进行友好访问以外，还进一步发展了互相在专业方面的学习和合作。这对于在经济、文化和科学技术方面比较落后的亚非各国来说，是特别重要的。
    这半年来，尽管日本现政府在许多方面对新中国采取了不友好的态度，尽管由于日本政府企图把不合理的限制的和侮辱性的规定强加于中国方面而使第四次中日民间贸易协定没有能够签订，但是，中日两国人民之间的来往和贸易关系还是有了很大的开展，体现了两国人民要求和平友好的共同愿望。在这期间，亚非各国访华的外宾中，仍然以日本朋友为最多，中国也派出了许多重要的代表团去日本访问。中国人民感谢日本人民和团体对中国各种代表团的招待和协助。中国人民高兴地看到日本商品展览会在广州的展出，并且祝贺它的成功。（掌声）
    我们向来主张世界各国用协商的方式解决相互之间的问题。我国和印度尼西亚签订的关于双重国籍问题的条约是一个范例。这个条约最近已经先后由印度尼西亚国会和我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准，不久之后就将生效。我国政府根据第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议批准的原则，同缅甸政府继续进行了关于边界问题的友好商谈。我们毫不怀疑，缅甸将同我们一起本着互相尊重和互相谅解的精神来共同解决这个问题。
    半年来，我们同北欧各国的关系是令人满意的。我国全国人民代表大会代表团去芬兰进行了答访，受到了热情的接待。我国同芬兰、瑞典和丹麦都签订了贸易协定，并且也同挪威就贸易问题进行了接触。
    在这期间，西欧的一些主要国家也表现出同中国开展贸易和进行技术合作的浓厚兴趣。英国贸易部的次官和法国、西德的民间性经济代表团曾经先后访问了中国。我们欢迎这种合作的愿望，并且也派出了代表团到英国、法国、奥地利和比利时去研究同这些国家开展贸易和进行技术合作的可能性。但是，必须指出，在对中国继续实行禁运的情况下，这种可能性必然会受到很大的限制。在这半年的期间，一个值得提到的现象是，美国青年代表不顾美国国务院的阻挠和恐吓，来到中国访问。他们有机会把亲自的见闻同美国国务院的污蔑宣传相比较。经过同中国人民的接触，他们也发现，在和平和友好的方面，中美两国人民有着广泛的共同点。
    自从朝鲜停战以来，中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国不断地采取积极步骤，使朝鲜的停战状态转变为持久的和平，实现朝鲜的和平统一。但是，美国却采取了截然相反的态度。它不仅竭力阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，而且还公然破坏朝鲜停战协定。去年六月，美国片面地宣布废除朝鲜停战协定中关于不得运进增援性武器的规定。半年以来，美国不顾朝中方面的抗议，把原子炮、导弹等新式武器运进南朝鲜，最近甚至在军事分界线附近举行所谓“原子出击”的演习。美国这样做，一方面是为了继续阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，另一方面是为了加剧远东的紧张局势，以便于加强对南朝鲜人民的殖民统治，进一步把南朝鲜变成美国的原子基地。这就证明，美国军队留在南朝鲜是对朝鲜人民的威胁，同时也是对远东和平的威胁。朝鲜人民和中国人民不能听任这种局势继续发展下去。
    为了实现朝鲜的和平统一，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府最近建议：从南北朝鲜同时撤出一切外国军队；在一切外国军队撤出后定期举行在中立国机构监督下的全朝鲜自由选举；南北朝鲜在对等的基础上进行协商，讨论南北朝鲜之间的经济、文化交流和全朝鲜选举等问题；南北朝鲜在最近期间各自将军队缩减到最低限度。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这些重大建议，不仅符合全体朝鲜人民的深切愿望，而且也提供了逐步和缓远东紧张局势的新的现实途径。中国政府完全支持朝鲜政府的建议，认为一切外国军队应该定期撤出朝鲜，并且已经声明准备同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府协商有关中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤出的问题。中国政府要求美国政府和参加联合国军的其它各国政府同样采取措施，从南朝鲜撤出美国军队和其它一切外国军队。（长时间的大鼓掌）
    中国政府一向认为：朝鲜问题只应该由朝鲜人民自己去解决，任何外力的干涉都是不容许的。大家知道，中国人民是在美国军队侵略了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国并且同时侵占我国领土台湾和严重地威胁我国安全的情况下，才组成志愿军前往朝鲜抗美援朝的。中国人民志愿军是正义的，是反抗侵略的，它同美国侵略军队的性质完全不同。朝鲜停战以后，中国方面就同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一道不断地向美国方面提出从南北朝鲜同时撤出一切外国军队的建议。这是在全朝鲜举行自由选举、实现朝鲜和平统一的关键。但是，美国方面一直拒绝朝中方面的建议。这就造成了朝鲜目前的僵局。为了打开这个僵局和促进远东的和平，中国政府响应朝鲜政府再一次提出的一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的建议，并且准备采取主动措施促使这个建议的实现。我们认为，有关各方采取积极步骤、共同努力、促进朝鲜问题和平解决的时机已经到来了。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    作为日内瓦协议的参加国和印度支那各国的近邻，中国一向关心印度支那和平的巩固和日内瓦协议的全面实施。中国政府全力支持越南民主共和国政府为促进越南的和平统一而作的不懈努力，并且认为目前日内瓦协议在越南的实施遭到阻挠和破坏的状况不应该再继续下去。老挝王国联合政府的成立和桑怒、丰沙里两省问题的解决，标志着日内瓦协议在老挝的实施已经取得了重大的进展。中国政府欢迎老挝王国在日内瓦协议的基础上实现和平统一。老挝的和平统一，为老挝的独立发展提供了更加有利的条件。尽管美国没有放弃把老挝拖进马尼拉条约集团的企图，但是，老挝同柬埔寨一样，仍然遵行着和平中立政策。几年来，中国和柬埔寨的关系有了良好的发展。中国政府也将本着一九五六年中国总理和老挝首相联合声明所确定的和平共处五项原则，努力发展中国和老挝的睦邻关系。（鼓掌）
    现在，我来谈谈中美关系。
    自从一九五五年八月中美大使级会谈开始以来，已经两年半了。尽管中国在和缓台湾地区紧张局势的问题上提出了一系列的积极建议，美国却始终坚持要中国承认美国占领台湾的现状，保持台湾地区的紧张局势。这就使得会谈在中美关系中的主要问题上不能取得任何进展。为了从比较容易解决的问题着手逐步改善中美关系，并且为中美间主要问题的解决创造有利条件，中国方面作了许多努力。半年来，中国方面又连续建议：中美两国政府在平等互惠基础上准许对方记者进行采访，两国政府就中美间的司法协助进行商谈。谁都可以看到，这是解决一些实际问题的建议，这些建议是公平合理的，对双方都是有利的。只要具有改善关系的诚意，在这些问题上达成协议是不应该有任何困难的。但是，对于这些建议，美国政府几乎是不加考虑地一概拒绝。记者采访和司法协助问题本来是美国记者和美国司法当局方面首先向中国提出的。中国政府愿意看到美国有关方面的这些愿望能够实现。但是，在美国政府不改变它的死硬的和敌视的态度以前，中国政府单方面的努力也是徒然的。
    美国在中美会谈中坚持要中国承认它霸占台湾的现状，是同它企图制造“两个中国”的阴谋分不开的。
    美国在对朝鲜发动侵略战争和加紧干涉印度支那的同时公开侵占台湾。美国统治集团不甘心他们在中国大陆上的失败，企图从朝鲜、印度支那、台湾三个方面来扼杀年青的中华人民共和国。但是，经过了几年的严重较量，朝鲜战争停止了，印度支那的和平恢复了，新中国在一天天地发展和壮大，中国人民解放台湾的可能性一天天地在增长。美国敌视中国人民、不承认新中国和在国际生活中排斥新中国的政策不仅丝毫不能损害新中国的存在和发展，反而使美国自己陷于越来越孤立的地位。为了摆脱这种困境，同时为了继续霸占台湾，美国就力图制造“两个中国”。
    美国同中国举行大使级的会谈，而在会谈中又要求中国承认它侵占台湾的现状。这在实质上就是企图制造“两个中国”，中国方面当然绝对不能容许。在联合国中，美国阻挠中国的合法权利的恢复，遭到越来越多的反对，它也认识到永远把中国排斥在联合国之外是不可能的。（鼓掌）因此美国目前的做法是先在一些国际会议和国际组织中尽可能地制造“两个中国”的局面，以便在国际上逐渐形成“两个中国”的既成事实。早在一九五六年十一月第十六届奥林匹克运动会上和一九五七年六月国际地球物理年的专门委员会上，美国就已经通过它的追随者进行过这种阴谋活动。到了一九五七年十月在新德里召开有八十个国家参加的第十九届国际红十字大会，美国便亲自出马进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动。在这个会上，美国代表坚持邀请台湾蒋介石集团派出所谓中华民国的代表团，同中华人民共和国的代表团同时出席大会。美国的提案虽然以六十二票赞成对四十四票反对的多数获得通过，但是在一百三十五票的总票数中，赞成美国提案的只是少数，而以各种形式支持中国反对制造“两个中国”的正义立场的却是多数。（鼓掌）美国的卑鄙阴谋在大会上引起公愤，全体社会主义国家、许多亚非国家和北欧国家的代表团跟中国代表团采取一致行动，退出会场，表示强烈抗议；（热烈鼓掌）还有一些国家的代表团留在会场，继续进行反对美国提案的斗争。这就使美国在政治上和道义上处于非常孤立的境地。
    但是，也应该指出，美国在制造“两个中国”的阴谋中不是没有追随者的。有些人企图在某些国际组织和国际会议中一方面保留蒋介石集团的代表，另一方面又邀请中华人民共和国代表参加，来造成“两个中国”的客观形势。当然，这里边也确实有对中国是友好的朋友，他们天真地认为这样做，就可以将新中国引进国际组织和国际活动中去，而不知实际上却上了美国制造“两个中国”局面的大当。有些人蓄意散布台湾地位未定和台湾居民不是汉族的谬论，主张在台湾进行所谓公民投票，实行所谓台湾自治，乃至对台湾进行托管，替美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋开辟道路。台湾是中国的领土。开罗宣言和波茨坦公告都承认台湾应该归还中国。事实上台湾已经在日本投降后归还中国。这些事实，连蒋介石集团也不能否认。就是目前积极制造“两个中国”的美国政府，也曾经一再确认过这些事实。台湾人口中的绝大多数是汉族，那里的少数民族同中国大陆上的其他少数民族一样，都是中国民族大家庭中的成员。关于台湾地位和台湾民族的谬论是完全没有根据的。制造这些谬论企图使台湾脱离祖国的种种阴谋，是永远不能实现的。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    英国政府一方面承认中华人民共和国，另一方面却在联合国中协助美国支持蒋介石集团窃据中国的席位。同时，英国还是散布台湾地位未定的谬论的中心。最近，英国政府同蒋介石集团的勾搭更有了显著的增加。中国是愿意同英国改善关系的，但是绝不会默认或者容忍英国追随美国制造“两个中国”。如果英国不改变它对待中国的两面态度，中英关系将不可避免地受到不利的影响。
    日本人民要求恢复日中邦交的运动已经成为日本政治生活中日益不容忽视的强大力量。但是，日本首相岸信介却企图利用这个形势，来达到别有用心的目的。一九五七年十一月十二日，他在日本参议院外务委员会上说：台湾海峡的紧张局势“是国民党人和共产党人都自称对大陆中国据有主权的结果”，“除非能调整他们的争执，否则就不可能消除紧张局势”。这不仅是替美国侵占台湾打掩护，而且是替美国制造“两个中国”找论据。这个企图早已被日本人民识破。例如，在一九五七年先后来中国访问的日本社会党访华亲善使节团、日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华使节团和日中友好协会访华代表团就都表示了促进中日邦交正常化的热烈愿望，并且认为解放台湾是中国的内政，反对制造“两个中国”。这就说明，用“两个中国”的论调混淆是非、蒙蔽日本人民固然不可能，企图利用日本人民广泛展开的恢复日中邦交运动为制造“两个中国”的阴谋服务，也是办不到的。（热烈鼓掌）
    中国政府和中国人民坚决反对制造“两个中国”的阴谋。不管这个阴谋在什么场合，以什么方式出现，我们绝不容许这个阴谋得逞。（热烈鼓掌）中国只有一个，那就是中华人民共和国。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）今天中美关系中的中心问题，并不是中国要美国承认，而是美国敌视中国人民，侵占中国领土，甚至还要中国承认这种侵占是合法的。这是一个不能含糊的大是大非的问题。（热烈鼓掌）台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，中国人民一定要解放台湾。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）全体中国人民都反对美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。（鼓掌）就是台湾蒋介石集团分子，只要还有爱国之心，也不会愿意看到“两个中国”的局面出现。当然，美国是不惜在台湾扶持一个更加顺从的傀儡政权来实现它的阴谋的。但是，我们伟大的民族从来不在外侮之下屈服，台湾的同胞也具有光荣的革命传统，只要所有爱国的中国人为祖国的完全统一坚持斗争，不容许美国对台湾的侵占合法化，台湾是一定要回到祖国的怀抱来的。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）不管美国承认不承认，中国是会永远存在和发展下去的。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）在联合国中排斥拥有六万万人口的中国，只能使联合国本身受到损害。在任何国际组织、国际会议和国际活动中造成“两个中国”的局面，都是我们绝对不能容许的。（鼓掌）这是我们坚定不移的立场。（热烈鼓掌）
    各位代表，过去的一年是不平凡的一年。在这一年里，国际形势和国内形势都发生了对我们极其有利的巨大变化。社会主义的事业和和平的事业，从来没有像今天这样兴隆旺盛。（热烈鼓掌）在我们面前，展开了无限光明的前景。这正是我们奋发有为的大好时光。（热烈鼓掌）让我们继续加强全国人民的团结，加强社会主义各国的团结，加强全世界人民的团结，鼓足革命干劲，为祖国的社会主义建设，为世界和平和人类进步，争取更伟大、更辉煌的胜利。（暴风雨般的长时间的大鼓掌）（附图片）
