Needs Reflection

There was a Japanese man named Minoru Yokota. More than two years ago, he came to China as the head of a Japanese news and broadcasting delegation. Before returning to his country, Mr. Yokota stated that upon his return to Japan, he would promote understanding and friendship between the people of China and Japan from the perspective of the news media.

However, after Yokota returned to Japan, he wrote many articles distorting the facts, which not only failed to promote but also hindered the understanding and friendship between the people of China and Japan.

Recently, Yokota felt that his actions of antagonizing the Chinese people were not enough, and he even led a group of Japanese reporters to Taiwan for a "visit." There, he made outrageous remarks, flattering the Chiang Kai-shek group with comments attacking the Chinese people. He even shamelessly expressed his desire to "reflect" on the fact that Japanese newspapers had not published enough news about the Chiang Kai-shek group and that they had "insufficient understanding" and "shallow comprehension" of it. This is truly the height of shamelessness.

Yokota really needs to "reflect." What he should reflect on is: why does he speak like a human to humans and like a demon to demons?

### 需要反省

    需要反省
    有一个日本人，名叫横田实。他在两年多以前曾以日本新闻广播界代表团团长的身份来到我国访问。这位团长先生在返国前表示，他回到日本以后，将要从新闻界的角度促进中日两国人民的了解和友谊。
    但是，横田实回国以后，就写了许多歪曲实事的文章，那些文章不但不能促进，而且阻碍了中日两国人民的了解和友谊。
    横田实最近觉得他敌视中国人民的事情还做得不够，竟然率领了一班日本记者到台湾去“访问”，而且在台湾大放厥词，以攻击中国人民的言论来向蒋介石集团献媚，甚至无耻地表示要为日本报纸刊登蒋介石集团的消息不多和对它“认识不够”、“理解浅薄”进行“反省”。真正不要脸到家了。
    横田实的确需要“反省”的。他该反省的是：到底为什么要见人说人话，见鬼说鬼话。
