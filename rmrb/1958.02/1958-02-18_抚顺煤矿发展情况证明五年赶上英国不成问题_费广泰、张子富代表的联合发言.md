We fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang respectively.

Under the leadership of the Party and the government, thanks to the active efforts of all employees, our Fushun Coal Mine has successfully overfulfilled the production and capital construction tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan. The output of raw coal increased from 5.33 million tons in 1952 to 9.23 million tons in 1957; the output of rich oil shale increased from 7.68 million tons in 1952 to 15 million tons in 1957; the output of carbon black increased from 65 tons in 1954 to 932 tons in 1957; the total labor productivity increased from 0.6865 tons per worker in 1952 to 1.2632 tons in 1957; and the cost per ton of coal decreased from 10.43 yuan in 1952 to 9.68 yuan in 1957. The Fushun Coal Mine, like coal mines across the country and other sectors, has achieved tremendous results.

1958 is the first year of our country's Second Five-Year Plan. The Party Central Committee issued a great call to the people of the whole country: "To catch up with or surpass England in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer." The people of the whole country are excited and take this as their goal. All employees of our Fushun Coal Mine also warmly responded to this call.

Can China's coal output catch up with England in fifteen years? We can answer affirmatively: "Yes, it can, it definitely can." China's coal output can catch up with England in five years and greatly surpass England in ten years.

Now, let us compare several major economic and technical indicators with England based on the actual situation of the Fushun Coal Mine:

Average Annual Output Growth Rate
One Year Equals 29 Years in England

1.  Comparing the average annual growth rate of coal production:

From 1941 to 1956, British coal production increased from 209.66 million tons to 225.56 million tons, an increase of 15.9 million tons in fifteen years, with an average annual growth rate of 0.5 percent. During the First Five-Year Plan, the average annual growth rate of coal production at the Fushun Coal Mine was 16.7 percent. Comparing the growth rate of coal production, the growth rate of the Fushun Coal Mine in one year is equivalent to 29 years in England, and the growth rate of the Fushun Coal Mine during the First Five-Year Plan is equivalent to 146 years in England.

Improvement of Labor Productivity
Five Years Equals 90 Years in England

2.  Comparing labor productivity:

The overall labor productivity of British coal mines increased from 1.03 tons per worker in 1913 to an estimated 1.5 tons per worker in 1956, an increase of 46 percent in 25 years. The overall labor productivity of the Fushun Coal Mine increased by 84 percent during the First Five-Year Plan. Comparing the increase in labor productivity, five years at the Fushun Coal Mine is equivalent to 90 years in England.

In 1955, the overall labor productivity of British coal mines was 1.23 tons per worker; in the same year, the Fushun Coal Mine was 1.1028 tons per worker, but in 1957 it was 1.263 tons per worker. The overall labor productivity of the Fushun Coal Mine was not as good as that of England in 1955, but in 1957 it exceeded England by 1.7 percent.

Production Cost Per Ton of Coal
Only Equals 43% of England's

3.  Comparing coal costs:

In 1955, the cost of British coal was 67 shillings and 3 pence per ton, equivalent to 22.28 yuan in RMB; the cost of the Fushun Coal Mine in 1957 was 9.68 yuan. The cost of British coal is 2.3 times that of the Fushun Coal Mine.

Natural Gas Production of Three Mines
More Than 28 Mines in England

4.  Comparison of natural gas production in coal mines:

According to an article written by Dr. Willett, Deputy Director of the Production Bureau of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the British Ministry of Fuel and Power: "Britain has been extracting gas on a small scale for more than 200 years, and it was not until 1950 that the experiment was successful. So far, a total of 6 million cubic feet (approximately 170,000 cubic meters) of gas is extracted daily from 28 mines in England."

Methane gas in coal seams is the deadly enemy of coal miners. Many methane explosion accidents have occurred in countries around the world. In Fushun, during the period of Japanese occupation in 1917, there was a world-shocking methane explosion accident that killed 917 people in one incident. Some mines, due to excessive methane, have never reached their designed output, and some do not even dare to drill holes, fire cannons, send electricity, or mechanize. They use backward manual methods of operation, resulting in high costs, low efficiency, and no guarantee of workers' lives. After liberation in 1949, under the correct leadership of the Party, all employees united together and brought into play their enthusiasm and creativity in the attitude of masters, creating a safe method of extracting gas first and then mining coal. So far, the total amount of gas extracted daily from only three mines in Fushun has reached 250,000 cubic meters, which is more than the gas extracted from 28 mines in England. At present, England has not yet used gas in the chemical industry, while we used most of the gas as chemical raw materials in 1952. Of the gas extracted daily, 60,000 cubic meters are used as fuel for laboratories, boiler rooms, and homes, and 190,000 cubic meters are used as industrial raw materials. As a result, the annual production of high-quality carbon black can reach more than 900 tons. It is estimated that after the factory is rebuilt, the annual output of carbon black can exceed 20,000 tons.

From the above figures, our development speed is amazing. Our speed is the speed of socialism, the speed of revolution, and the speed determined by our superior socialist system. This is destined to make capitalist countries inevitably fail in the competition with us and be left far behind us.

This Year's Coal Output Can Reach or Exceed 10 Million Tons from the Original Plan of 9.4 Million Tons

Our Fushun Coal Mine, together with brother coal mines across the country and the people of the whole country, has entered 1958 with heroic steps. On the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, the rectification movement is gradually deepening. After great airing of views, great rectification, great transformation, and great socialist debate, the ideological consciousness of all employees has been greatly improved, and a new production upsurge has been formed. At the recent advanced producer representative conference held in the Fushun mining area, many employees put forward new guarantee conditions. For example, the electric locomotive driver workers in the open-pit mine proposed that on the basis of one locomotive pulling 570,000 cubic meters in 1957, they would further study technology, improve technology, and master new technologies, and they would be able to pull 650,000 cubic meters in 1958; electric shovel workers proposed that on the basis of one electric shovel bedding 920,000 cubic meters in 1957, they would increase it to 1 million cubic meters in 1958. For example, underground miners proposed to increase the recovery rate of pit props from 20 percent in 1957 to 30 percent. For example, workers in the machine repair factory proposed that in order to ensure a great leap forward in coal mining production, they would complete one and a half years of work in one year to ensure the dispatch of machinery and give full play to the effectiveness of the machinery. After preliminary discussions among the mine workers, this year's coal output can reach or exceed 10 million tons from the original plan of 9.4 million tons; on the premise of ensuring the needs of the petroleum industry, the output of rich oil shale can strive to exceed the original plan of 15.2 million tons; due to export needs, the output of carbon black will strive to reach 1,850 tons, exceeding the original plan by 850 tons; the cost should be reduced by 3.6 percent compared with 1957, creating a total of 65 million yuan in profits for the state.

A leap forward should also be made in capital construction. The Fushun Coal Mine proposed to further implement the policy of building the country and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and doing more, faster, better, and more economically in the capital construction work in 1958, oppose all waste, spend less money, do more things, and complete a capital construction workload of 100 million yuan with an investment of 90 million yuan. Starting from 1958, the Fushun Coal Mine will enter a new stage of comprehensive reconstruction, striving to basically complete the overall reconstruction project of the Fushun Coal Mine by 1962, thereby ensuring that on the basis of a great leap forward in production in 1958, the output of coal and rich oil shale will continue to increase year by year and continue to leap forward.

In short, judging from the actual situation of the Fushun Coal Mine and the development of the national coal industry, in terms of coal output, we will definitely be able to catch up with or surpass England in five years. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, as long as we boost our energy, strive for the top, and earnestly implement the Party's various correct guidelines and policies, we will definitely be able to complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state. Victory belongs to us, and victory belongs to the people!

    抚顺煤矿发展情况证明五年赶上英国不成问题
    费广泰、张子富代表的联合发言
    我们完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任分别所作的各项报告。
    我们抚顺煤矿在党和政府的领导下，由于全体职工的积极努力，已经胜利地超额完成了第一个五年计划所规定的生产和基本建设任务。原煤产量由一九五二年的五百三十三万吨提高到一九五七年的九百二十三万吨；油母页岩富矿的产量由一九五二年的七百六十八万吨，提高到一九五七年的一千五百万吨；炭黑产量由一九五四年的六十五吨，提高到一九五七年的九百三十二吨；全员劳动生产率由一九五二年的每工零点六八六五吨，提高到一九五七年的一点二六三二吨；每吨煤的成本由一九五二年的十元四角三分，降低到一九五七年的九元六角八分。抚顺煤矿像全国煤矿一样，像全国其他部门一样，成绩是巨大的。
    一九五八年是我国第二个五年计划的第一年，党中央向全国人民发出了伟大的号召：“在十五年或者更多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品产量方面，赶上或超过英国”，全国人心振奋，都以这作为自己的奋斗目标。我们抚顺煤矿全体职工也同样热烈地响应这个号召。
    我国煤炭产量在十五年内能不能赶上英国呢？我们可以肯定地回答：“能赶上，一定能赶上”。我国煤炭产量五年就可以赶上英国，十年就可以大大超过英国。
    现在，我们以抚顺煤矿的实际情况，就几个主要的经济技术指标与英国来对比一下：
    平均年产量增长速度
    一年等于英国二十九年
    1、从煤炭产量每年平均增长速度来比：
    英国煤炭产量从一九四一年的二亿零九百六十六万吨，提高到一九五六年的二亿二千五百五十六万吨，十五年间产量提高一千五百九十万吨，每年平均增长速度为百分之零点五。抚顺煤矿第一个五年计划期间的煤炭产量，每年平均增长速度为百分之十六点七。从煤炭产量的增长速度来比，抚顺煤矿一年的增长速度，相当于英国二十九年，抚顺煤矿第一个五年计划期间的增长速度相当于英国的一百四十六年。
    劳动生产率的提高
    五年相当于英国九十年
    2、从劳动生产率来比：
    英国煤矿的全员劳动生产率，由一九一三年的每工一点零三吨，提高到一九五六年预计的每工一点五吨，二十五年间共计提高百分之四十六。抚顺煤矿的全员劳动生产率，在第一个五年计划期间就提高百分之八十四。从劳动生产率的提高数字来比，抚顺煤矿的五年相当英国的九十年。
    一九五五年英国煤矿的全员劳动生产率每工为一点二三吨；同年度抚顺煤矿每工为一点一○二八吨，但一九五七年每工为一点二六三吨。抚顺煤矿的全员劳动生产率一九五五年还比不上英国，而一九五七年却超过了英国百分之一点七。
    每吨煤的生产成本
    只等于英国的43％
    3、从煤炭成本来比：
    英国一九五五年每吨煤炭的成本为六十七先令三便士，折合人民币为二十二元二角八分；抚顺煤矿一九五七年的成本为九元六角八分。英国煤炭的成本相当于抚顺煤矿的二点三倍。
    三个矿的天然瓦斯产量
    比英国二十八个矿还多
    4、煤矿天然瓦斯产量的对比：
    根据英国燃料动力部煤矿管理局生产局副局长威利特博士所写的文章说：“英国先后小规模抽放瓦斯已有二百多年之久，直到一九五○年才试验成功。到目前为止，英国二十八个矿中，每天总计抽出六百万立方呎（约合十七万立方公尺）的瓦斯”。
    煤层里的瓦斯是煤矿工人的死敌，世界各国发生过很多瓦斯爆炸事故，我们抚顺在一九一七年日寇统治的时期曾发生过震惊世界的瓦斯爆炸事故，一次就死亡九百一十七人。有的矿由于瓦斯多，始终达不到设计产量，甚至不敢打眼，不敢放炮，不敢送电，不敢机械化，用落后的手工方法作业成本高，效率低，工人的生命没有保障。一九四九年解放以后，在党的正确领导下，全体职工团结在一起，以主人翁的态度发挥了积极性和创造性，创造了先抽瓦斯后采煤的安全方法。到目前为止，仅仅抚顺的三个矿每天总计抽出的瓦斯达二十五万立方公尺，这个产量就比英国二十八个矿所抽出的瓦斯还多。现在，英国还没有把瓦斯利用到化学工业上去，而我们在一九五二年就有大部分的瓦斯用作化工原料，在每天抽出的瓦斯中，六万立方公尺是供应试验室、锅炉房及家庭作燃料之用，十九万立方公尺作工业原料之用。因而生产品质优良的炭黑年产可达九百多吨。预计工厂改建后，炭黑年产量可以超过二万吨。
    从上面这些数字来看，我们的发展速度是惊人的。我们的速度是社会主义的速度，是革命的速度，是我们优越的社会主义制度的决定的速度。这就注定了资本主义国家同我们的竞赛中，必然遭到失败，必然被我们远远地甩在后面。
    今年煤炭产量可由原计划的九百四十万吨达到或超过一千万吨
    我们抚顺煤矿同全国兄弟煤矿、全国人民一道以豪迈的步伐，迈入了一九五八年。在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，整风运动逐步深入，经过大鸣大放、大整大改、社会主义大辩论，全体职工的思想觉悟大大提高，一个新的生产高潮已经形成。最近在抚顺矿区召开的先进生产者代表大会上，许多职工纷纷提出新的保证条件。如露天矿电机车司机工人提出：在一九五七年一台机车拉五十七万立方公尺的基础上，进一步学习技术、提高技术和掌握新技术，在一九五八年就可以拉六十五万立方公尺；电铲工人提出：在一九五七年一台电铲床九十二万立方公尺的基础上，一九五八年提高到一百万立方公尺。又如矿井工人提出要提高坑木回收率，从一九五七年的百分之二十提高到百分之三十。再如机修厂工人提出，为了保证采煤生产大跃进，要用一年的时间完成一年半的工作任务，保证机械出动和发挥机械效能。经过矿区职工初步讨论，今年煤炭产量可以由原计划的九百四十万吨达到或超过一千万吨；油母页岩富矿产量在保证石油工业需要的条件下，可以争取超过原计划的一千五百二十万吨；炭黑产量由于出国的需要，争取达到一千八百五十吨，比原计划超过八百五十吨；成本要比一九五七年降低百分之三点六，给国家创造上缴利润合计为六千五百万元。
    在基本建设上也要来一个跃进，抚顺煤矿提出在一九五八年度的基本建设工作中，进一步贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业和多、快、好、省的方针，反对一切浪费，少花钱，多办事，以九千万元的投资完成一个亿的基本建设工作量，从一九五八年开始使抚顺煤矿进入一个全面改建的新阶段，争取到一九六二年止基本完成抚顺煤矿总体改建工程，从而保证在一九五八年度生产大跃进的基础上逐年使煤炭和油母页岩富矿产量不断地增涨不断地跃进。
    总之，从抚顺煤矿的实际情况和全国煤炭工业发展情况来看，在煤炭产量方面，我们用五年的时间，一定能够赶上或超过英国。在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，只要我们鼓起干劲，力争上游，认真贯彻党的各项正确的方针、政策，一定能够完成党和国家交给我们的光荣任务。胜利是属于我们的，胜利是属于人民的！
