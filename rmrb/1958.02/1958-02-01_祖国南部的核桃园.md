　　Walnut Orchard in Southern Motherland
　　Liyun
    Yangbi County, Yunnan Province, is a mountainous county located at an altitude of 1,100 to 2,600 meters. The terrain is complex and the climate varies greatly. The county has three types of climates: temperate, subtropical, and alpine. The annual rainfall is 1,000 to 1,300 millimeters. The forests here are dense, and walnut trees grow into forests, which have always been known as a "natural walnut orchard." These sayings are not exaggerated. Out of the county's forty-four townships, all but Shangjie Township have walnut cultivation. According to statistics, there are currently 620,000 walnut trees, covering an area of approximately 62,000 mu. In the early days of liberation, the annual output of walnuts was 140 million. In 1954, it reached more than 170 million. The output value of walnuts accounted for 21% of the total agricultural and sideline product output value of Yangbi County (excluding household sideline production). In Gaofa Township, 97.6% of farmers grow walnuts. Walnut income accounts for 30% of the total income from agricultural and sideline products, with an average of 76.5 yuan per household. Meixi Township produces more than 12 million walnuts annually, accounting for about 50% of total income.
    Farmers in Yangbi County call walnuts "living treasures," and they have a saying: "Walnut trees are evergreen for ten thousand years; you can knock them generation after generation without exhausting them."
    In addition to the existing 60,000 mu of walnut forests, there are about 200,000 mu of mountain slopes suitable for walnut cultivation. At the same time, wild seedlings are everywhere. For example, Yangdi Village in Gaofa Township has no fewer than 6,000 wild walnut seedlings every year. With more human effort, these seedlings can bear fruit in five or six years. Because Yangbi County has a long history of walnut cultivation for hundreds of years, it has rich experience. Every cooperative has dozens of grafting experts.
    In the second five-year plan, the county plans to develop another 150,000 mu (1.5 million trees) of walnuts. Based on the 140 million walnuts in 1957, the output will increase to 431.5 million by 1962, which is 308.2% of 1957; in the third five-year plan, another 50,000 mu will be developed, and the planned output can reach 786 million, which is 561.44% of 1957. At that time, the average household will earn 160 yuan. The oil pressed from these walnuts (more than 5.34 million jin) can support 890,000 people in the city for a year.

　　祖国南部的核桃园
　　丽云
    云南省漾濞县是地处海拔一千一百至二千六百公尺的一个山区县，地势复杂，气候悬殊较大，全县有温、亚热、高寒三种气候，年雨量一千至一千三百公厘。这里森林茂密，核桃成林，一向有“天然核桃园”之称。人们的这些说法并不夸大。全县四十四个乡，除上街乡一个乡没有生长核桃外，其他地区都有种植。据统计，现有核桃六十二万棵，占地约六万二千亩。解放初期，核桃年产量一亿四千万个，1954年达到一亿七千多万个。核桃产值占漾濞县农副业总产值（不包括家庭副业）的21％。高发乡97.6％的农户都种有核桃，核桃收入占农副业总收入的30％，平均每户可分得七十六元五角。美翕乡年产核桃一千二百多万个，占总收入50％左右。
    漾濞县农民称核桃为“活宝”，他们流传着这样一句话：“核桃树万年椿，世世代代敲不光”。
    这里的核桃除现有成林六万多亩以外，还有二十万亩左右适宜种植核桃的山坡；同时，野生幼苗到处都有。如高发乡羊底村每年野生的核桃幼苗不下六千株，这些幼苗只要多加人工，五、六年后即可结实。由于漾濞县种植核桃具有数百年悠久历史，蕴藏着的经验也很丰富，每个社都有几十个嫁接能手。
    在第二个五年计划中，这个县计划再发展核桃十五万亩（一百五十万棵），产量在1957年一亿四千万个的基础上，到1962年增加至四亿三千一百五十万个，为1957年的308.2％；第三个五年计划再发展五万亩，计划产量可达七亿八千六百万个，为1957年的561.44％。那时平均每户将收入一百六十元；这些核桃榨的油（五百三十四万多斤），可支援八十九万人口的城市吃一年。
