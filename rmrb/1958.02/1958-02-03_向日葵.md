　　Sunflower
　　The sunflower, also known as sunflower seed or turning-to-the-sun lotus, is an annual herb belonging to the Compositae family. Sunflowers are grown throughout China. According to statistics in 1956, the total area was approximately more than one million mu. Large areas are cultivated in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces. In 1956, Heilongjiang had 360,000 mu, and Jilin had 260,000 mu.
　　The sunflower is a relatively high-yielding oil crop. The general yield per mu is about 100 to 120 jin, with high yields reaching 300 jin. In 1956, the national average yield per unit area was 91.8 jin. The Gao Cun Farm in Shanxi Province planted sunflowers on saline-alkali land, and 300 mu averaged 215 jin per mu. The Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Dingxiang County, this province, averaged 300 jin per mu on 15 mu of high-yield land last year.
　　Sunflower seeds have a very high oil content. Generally, edible seeds contain about 30% oil, while oil-use seeds contain 40% to 55% oil. The oil yield per mu is second only to peanuts. Sunflower oil is a very good cooking oil, and it is currently listed as a major edible vegetable oil in the Soviet Union. Sunflower oil is also a raw material for making paints, soaps, and candles. The sunflower cake after oil extraction is nutritious and can be used as feed or to make soy sauce. Sunflower stalks can be used to make paper and soundproof boards, and the ash can be used as potash fertilizer. Sunflower discs can also be used to feed pigs. The seed shells can be used to make alcohol and furfural. Furfural is also a raw material for making plastics and man-made fibers (i.e., nylon).
　　Sunflowers are highly adaptable and have the characteristics of being drought-resistant, barren-resistant, and salt-alkali-resistant. Sunflowers germinate and grow well in soils with a salt content of 0.3-0.4%, so saline-alkali wasteland can be fully utilized for development without occupying grain arable land. It is estimated that there are approximately 30 million mu of saline-alkali wasteland in northern China (including Northeast China) and coastal areas. In addition to some sandy wasteland that should be used for growing peanuts, most of it can be planted with sunflowers.
　　In the past two years, China's agricultural departments have introduced more than ten oil-use varieties from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and Hungary. The Soviet "Steppe Dweller," "Soviet No. 3," and "Hungarian No. 1," which are being tested in some areas, are among them. "San Dao Mei" grown in Hebei and "Wu Zui" grown in Heilongjiang and other places are excellent varieties selected and bred by Chinese farmers.
　　Sunflower seeds can germinate at a temperature of three to five degrees Celsius, and seedlings have strong resistance to spring cold and late frost, so they can be sown appropriately early. In most parts of China, the period from "Qingming" (Tomb Sweeping Day) to "Lixia" (Beginning of Summer) is the sowing season.

　　向日葵
    向日葵又叫葵花子、转日莲，属菊科一年生草本植物。向日葵在我国各地都有种植，据1956年统计，总面积约有一百多万亩。黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古、河北、山西等省都有大面积栽培，1956年黑龙江有三十六万亩，吉林有二十六万亩。
    向日葵是一项比较高产的油料作物。一般亩产一百到一百二十斤左右，产量高的三百斤，1956年全国平均单位产量九十一点八斤。山西省高村农场在盐碱地上种植的向日葵，有三百亩平均亩产二百一十五斤。这个省定襄县和平农业社去年曾在十五亩丰产地上每亩平均收了三百斤。
    葵籽的含油量很高，一般食用种的种子含油量为30％左右，油用种的种子含油量40％到55％，每亩产油量仅次于花生。葵油是一种很好的食用油，目前苏联列为主要的食用植物油。葵油还是制造油漆、肥皂、蜡烛的原料。榨油后的葵饼富有营养，既可作饲料，还可制造酱油。葵茎秆可以造纸，还可以制隔音板，烧灰可以作钾质肥料。葵盘也可喂猪。籽壳可制造酒精和?醛，?醛又是制塑料及人造纤维（即尼隆）的原料。
    向日葵的适应性很强，并有耐旱耐瘠耐盐碱的特性，在含盐量0.3—0.4％的土壤里，向日葵的发芽和生长都很良好，因此可以充分利用盐碱荒地发展，而不占用粮食耕地。据估计，我国北方（包括东北在内）及沿海一带约有盐碱荒地三千万亩，除一部分沙荒地应该发展花生以外，大部分可以种植向日葵。
    近两年来，我国农业部门从苏联、匈牙利等兄弟国家引进了十多个油用品种，现在一些地区试种的苏联“草原人”“苏联三号”“匈牙利一号”等都是。河北等地种植的“三道眉”和黑龙江等地的“乌嘴”等是我国农民选育出来的优良品种。
    向日葵种子在摄氏三到五度的情况就可发芽，幼苗对春寒晚霜的抵抗能力较强，因此可以适当早播。就我国大部地区说，“清明”到“立夏”间，是播种的季节。
