    Let Me Buy a Refractory Brick
    Ye Boxiang, Shandong Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration

    When it comes to buying government bonds, I've made it a habit. Every year at the beginning of the year, I always consider my income and expenses for the whole year, so I can buy government bonds. Last year, I even decided to use the money I had saved for a watch to buy government bonds. A year has passed, and although I read in the newspaper that our domestically produced watches had already left the factory, I don't know if they haven't come to Jinan or if it's because I don't often go to department stores, but until now, I haven't bought one. Now I don't even want to buy one, I'll wait and see. Not having a watch makes it a bit more difficult to keep track of time, but someone like me can still manage.

    This year I'm going to subscribe to government bonds again. At first, when I discussed it with my wife, I only planned to buy 100 yuan, and she planned to buy 90 yuan. After that, I felt like a stone was weighing on my heart, and I asked myself a question: Have I done my best? Based on my current financial situation, as long as I plan properly and live frugally, I can buy another 50 yuan. When the group meeting started the subscription, I made a comprehensive consideration again, and felt that I could buy a little more, so I subscribed for 180 yuan.

    One hundred and eighty yuan is an insignificant amount, truly a drop in the ocean of the funds needed to build the motherland. But I feel very happy, even if it can't build a steel plant, it can buy a refractory brick for building a Martin furnace; even if it can't build a textile factory, it can buy a spindle for a spinning machine, then let me buy a refractory brick, let me buy a spindle! Being able to do this is my greatest joy, is there anything that can compare with this?

    让我买一块耐火砖吧
    山东省邮电管理局　叶伯翔
    提起买公债，我已经成为习惯了。每年年初，我总要考虑一下全年收入与支出的情况，好买公债。去年，我也曾决定说是把买手表的钱买了公债。一年过去了，虽然从报纸上看到我们的国产手表已经出了厂，不知是没有来到过济南还是因为我不常到百货公司去，直到现在，我还没有买到。现在我索兴也不想买了，等一等再说。没有手表，在掌握时间上是要困难些，但像我这样的人，总还可以过得去。
    今年又要认购公债了，起先，我和爱人商量的时候，只准备买一百元，她准备买九十元。这以后，我心上好像有一块石头没有放下，向自己提出了一个问题：是不是尽上了自己的力量呢？根据我现有的经济条件，只要适当安排，勤俭持家，还可以多买五十元。当小组会上开始认购时，我又作了全面的考虑，觉得还可以多买一些，结果认购了一百八十元。
    一百八十元，这是一个微不足道的数目，在建设祖国所需要的资金中，真是大海里的一滴。但我觉得很高兴，它纵然不能修建一个钢铁厂，也可以为修建一座马丁炉买上一块耐火砖；它纵然不能修建一个纺织厂，也可以给纺纱机买上一个纱锭，那末就让我买一块耐火砖吧，就让我买一个纱锭吧！我能够做到这一步，这就是我最大的快乐，难道还有什么可以和这个相比拟呢？
