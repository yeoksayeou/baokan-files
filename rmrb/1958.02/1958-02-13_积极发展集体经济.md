Actively Develop the Collective Economy
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    The majority of agricultural cooperatives in our country are currently expanding public accumulation and expanded reproduction on the basis of the growing collective economy, while also ensuring that the majority of members gradually increase their income and improve their lives, thus demonstrating the superiority of the cooperative system. However, according to recent survey materials from various regions, there is also a portion of agricultural cooperatives that have not actively organized the masses of members to develop the collective economy, especially collective sideline occupations, resulting in slow development of public accumulation and the inability to expand the scale of reproduction. For example, in nine counties of the Fuling Special District in Sichuan, the collective sideline occupations of agricultural cooperatives account for only 23% of the total income from rural sideline occupations (the sum of income from collective sideline occupations within the cooperatives and household sideline occupations of members), and 20% of the cooperatives do not engage in collective sideline occupations at all. Pig raising is the most common and largest rural sideline occupation, but in some places, agricultural cooperatives do not actively develop collective pig raising and only allow individual members to raise pigs. It is a good thing for members to raise pigs individually, but it is not good for agricultural cooperatives to completely withdraw from the pig raising industry. It is understood that by the fall of last year, the number of pigs raised in Jiangsu Province increased to 9.7 million, of which only 3.36% were publicly raised by agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, the private sideline occupations of members have rapidly expanded, with an increasing proportion. In the Xiejiang Agricultural Cooperative in Dayi County, Sichuan, among more than 600 member households, the income from household sideline occupations of more than 150 households has caught up with or even exceeded the income derived from the collective economy. In the Xihu Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangtan County, Hunan, among the 88 member households participating in distribution in 1957, 33 households had household sideline income accounting for more than half of the total family income. Superficially, no matter what, the income of the members has always increased, which is always beneficial to the masses. But things are not that simple.

    First, if members are too interested in private sideline occupations, even to the point of regarding sideline occupations as their main occupation, they will become increasingly unconcerned about the collective interests of the agricultural cooperative, first of all being unconcerned about the cooperative's agricultural production. During the busy farming season when the cooperative urgently needs labor, members will spend most of their time and energy on private plots and other individual sideline occupations. When the cooperative assigns work, it takes "three invitations and four urgings" before they come out to deal with it perfunctorily. The Baofeng Thirteenth Cooperative in Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, once had to pay to hire workers to do the work because of this. At the same time, the cooperative's farmland urgently needs fertilizer, but the members apply a large amount of their own fertilizer to their private plots. Some cooperatives have had to pay high prices to buy fertilizer from other places because members are unwilling to contribute fertilizer to the cooperative; if they cannot buy it, they have to allow the farmland to reduce production due to lack of fertilizer. In 1957, the Xihu Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangtan County, Hunan, reduced the yield of rice per mu by 10.8% compared with the severely drought-stricken year of 1956 for the above reasons under normal weather conditions. If this continues to develop, it will have a major impact on agriculture.

    Second, the so-called development of private sideline occupations of members is sometimes mixed with commercial speculation. Wealthier middle peasants and rich peasants in rural areas often consciously guide sideline occupations towards speculative buying and selling. This situation has been found in many places. This is very detrimental to our country's market prices and overall economic order.

    Third, the collectivist ideology of members will be weakened invisibly due to excessive attention to private sideline occupations, the contradictions between this part of the members and that part of the members will continue to grow, and unity will become increasingly loose. For example, some members use their main strength in individual operations, and the work-days they do in the cooperative are not even enough to cover their rations. They say: "It doesn't matter if I don't have enough rations, I have money to buy." They think they are eating their own, but in fact, they have to rely on the grain produced by others to live. In today's situation where grain is relatively tight, those members who actively participate in agricultural production labor in the cooperative will of course oppose them. These members who actively engage in agricultural production are mostly poor and lower-middle peasants who have no surplus money.

    The socialist nature of agricultural cooperatives determines that they must develop the collective economy in a planned way and make the collective economy the main source of income for members; and the household sideline occupations of members can only be supplementary and cannot become the main source of income (of course, they are also indispensable). The superiority of the cooperative system should also be reflected here. If members are allowed to shift their interest in developing the collective economy to developing the individual economy, so that the individual economy overwhelms the collective economy, this will change the nature of the cooperative, and the phenomenon of disparity between rich and poor, and even exploitation of man by man, will reappear.

    Agriculture has always relied on sideline occupations for support. If agricultural cooperatives do not actively develop diverse economies, including collective sideline occupations, and increase income in multiple ways, it will be difficult to expand public accumulation and expand reproduction. The working capital needed for daily production will also be difficult to turn over. At the same time, it should also be seen that the large-scale development of basic construction such as water conservancy projects requires more and more tools and equipment, such as bricks, tiles, lime, iron and wood tools, ropes, and so on. This also requires agricultural cooperatives to incorporate the production of these equipment into their own sideline production plans as much as possible, use local materials, and produce locally to support basic construction.

    In the first year after cooperativization, that is, the first half of 1956, many places excessively emphasized collective production and imposed too many restrictions on the household sideline occupations of members. Later, various places quickly corrected this shortcoming, which was absolutely necessary. However, last year some agricultural cooperatives went to another extreme—even abandoning some large-scale sideline occupations that should be managed uniformly by the cooperative. On the one hand, the leadership did not seriously implement the policy of overall planning and comprehensive consideration; on the other hand, some cooperatives catered to the erroneous demands of some wealthier middle peasants. These wealthier middle peasants with strong capitalist tendencies always attempt to change the face of the cooperative according to their own demands. Opposing planned collective management and advocating the implementation of as much decentralized individual management as possible is one aspect of their erroneous demands. Should we prioritize the development of collective sideline occupations? Or should we prioritize the development of individual sideline occupations? Should everyone ride a socialist ship together and work together to sail forward? Or should we allow everyone to ride their own small boats and float freely in the sea? This is essentially a struggle between two roads: socialism and capitalism. Some agricultural cooperatives have recently seized on this issue to launch a major debate, presenting facts and explaining the advantages and disadvantages, powerfully criticizing capitalist and individualistic ideas, and greatly enhancing the collectivist ideology and love-for-the-cooperative concept of the masses of members. When the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative in Hedeng Township, Xinfan County, Sichuan, conducted a debate not long ago, the wealthy peasant Huang Liancheng opposed the agricultural cooperative taking back the excessive private plots of members, arguing that his income in the cooperative had decreased and he had to rely on the private plots to live. Other members retorted, "You don't invest, and you don't work in the cooperative, how can your income increase?" In the end, this wealthy peasant had to admit his mistake. The progress of the debate proves that the majority of peasants are willing to actively develop the collective economy. All cooperatives that have this problem need to solve this problem ideologically first through debate.

    Now, agricultural cooperatives in various places are formulating and revising their 1958 production plans and long-term plans. Leading organs at all levels have the responsibility to help agricultural cooperatives correctly handle the relationship between collective sideline occupations and household sideline occupations of members. The most important thing is to make an overall plan for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations based on the principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, and appropriate arrangements. Through overall planning, each agricultural cooperative can clearly define the scope of operations: all large-scale and long-term sideline occupations should be operated by the cooperative; smaller sideline occupations can be operated by production teams; and scattered, daily sideline occupations can be operated by individual members. Agricultural cooperatives should neither restrict the household sideline occupations of members too much nor let them go unchecked. Their responsibility is to help members properly arrange household sideline occupations, especially to help households in difficulty to develop household sideline occupations. Every member should be able to develop household sideline occupations without harming the collective interests of the cooperative. In order to achieve this, in addition to ideological education, it is also necessary to make necessary regulations on specific issues such as the area of private plots, fertilizer for member households, members going out to do short-term work, and the number of days members work in the cooperative through mass democratic discussions.

    积极发展集体经济
    本报评论员
    我国大多数农业合作社，目前正在集体经济日益发展的基础上扩大公共积累，扩大再生产，同时也保证大多数社员逐步增加收入，改善生活，从而显示了合作化制度的优越性。但是，根据最近时期各地的调查材料，也有一部分农业合作社没有积极地组织社员群众发展集体经济，尤其是集体副业，以致公共积累发展迟缓，再生产的规模不能扩大。比如四川涪陵专区九个县农业合作社的集体副业只占农村副业总收入（社内集体副业和社员家庭副业收入的总和）的23％，其中还有20％的社根本没有经营集体副业。养猪是最普遍、最大宗的农村副业，但是，在有些地方，农业合作社不去积极发展集体养猪，光让社员个人去养。社员们家家户户自己养猪是好事，但是农业合作社完全退出养猪业阵地就不好。据了解，江苏省去年秋后全省养猪数字增加到九百七十万头，其中属于农业合作社公养的只有3.36％。与此同时，社员的私人副业却迅速地膨胀起来，比重越来越大了。四川大邑县斜江农业合作社的六百多户社员当中，有一百五十多户家庭副业收入赶上甚至超过了从集体经济所分得的收入。湖南湘潭县西湖农业社1957年参加分配的八十八户社员当中，家庭副业收入占全家总收入一半以上的有三十三户。表面看去，不管怎样社员收入总是增加了，对群众总是有好处的。但事情没有这么简单。
    第一、社员对私人副业兴趣太浓，甚至把副业当成了主业，他们就会越来越不关心农业合作社的集体利益，首先是不关心社的农业生产。正当社里急需劳力的农忙季节，社员们却会把大部分时间和精力用在自留地和其他个人副业上，社里派工，要经过“三请四催”，他们才出来应付一下。江苏省吴县保丰十三社曾因此而不得不出钱请工做活。同时，社里的农田急需肥料，社员们却把自家的大量肥料都施到自留地上。有些社因为社员不肯向社里投肥料，只好出大价钱到外地购买；买不到的，只好听任农田因缺肥而减产。湖南湘潭县西湖农业社1957年就是因为上面的缘故，在正常年景下稻谷每亩产量比大旱的1956年减少10.8％。这样发展下去，对农业会有重大影响的。
    第二、所谓社员私人副业的发展，有时候是和商业投机活动掺搅在一起的。农村中的富裕中农和富农，时常有意识地把副业引向投机贩运。这种情形各地都发现不少。这是对我们国家的市场物价和整个经济秩序十分不利的。
    第三、社员的集体主义思想会因过多地注意私人副业而无形中削弱，这部分社员和那部分社员之间的矛盾会不断增长，团结会越来越松懈。比如有些社员把主要力量用在个体经营上，在社里做的劳动日连口粮都抵不上。他们说：“不够口粮没啥关系，我有钱买。”他们自以为是吃自己，实际得靠别人生产的粮食过活。在粮食比较紧张的今日，那些在社里积极参加农业生产劳动的社员，当然会反对他们。这些积极搞农业生产的社员，多半是没有余钱的贫农下中农。
    农业合作社的社会主义性质，决定了它必须有计划地发展集体经济，并使集体经济成为社员收入的主要来源；而社员的家庭副业只能是辅助的而不能成为主要的收入来源（当然也是不可少的）。合作化制度的优越性也应当体现在这里。如果听任社员把发展集体经济的兴趣转向发展个体经济，以致个体经济压倒集体经济，这就会使合作社的性质发生变化，贫富悬殊以至人剥削人的现象也会重新出现。
    农业历来是要靠副业来支援的。如果农业合作社不去积极地发展包括集体副业在内的多种经济，多方面地增加收入，要扩大公共积累和扩大再生产是很困难的。日常生产所需要的流动资金，也会周转不灵。同时还要看到，兴修水利等基本建设的大发展，需要越来越多的工具和器材，如砖、瓦、石灰、铁木工具、绳索等等。这也要求农业合作社尽可能把这些器材的生产纳入自己的副业生产规划之内，就地取材，就地生产，支援基本建设。
    在合作化后第一年即1956年的上半年，很多地方曾经过分强调集体生产，对于社员家庭副业限制过多过死。后来各地很快纠正了这个缺点，这是完全必要的。但是，去年有些农业合作社又走向另一个极端——连一些应当由社统一经营的大宗副业也放弃了。一方面是由于领导方面没有认真贯彻执行统筹兼顾方针，一方面也由于某些合作社迁就了一部分富裕中农的错误要求。这些有着强烈资本主义倾向的富裕中农，总是企图按照他们自己的要求来改变合作社的面貌。反对有计划的集体经营，主张实行尽可能多的分散的个体的经营，就是他们的错误要求的一个方面。究竟是优先发展集体副业呢？还是优先发展个体副业？是大家共乘一只社会主义大船齐心协力向前航行呢？还是听任各人自乘小船在大海里自由浮沉？这实质上是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。有些农业合作社最近抓住这个问题展开大辩论，摆事实，讲利害，有力地批判了资本主义和个人主义思想，大大地提高了社员群众的集体主义思想和爱社观念。四川新繁县禾登乡新民农业合作社不久以前进行辩论时，富裕农民黄连成反对农业合作社收回社员过多的自留地，理由是他在社里的收入减少了，他要靠自留地生活。其他社员反驳他说：“你不投资，又不在社里干活，怎么会增加收入？”最后这个富裕农民不得不承认错误。辩论的进程证明，大多数农民是愿意积极发展集体经济的。凡是存在着这个问题的社，都需要通过辩论，首先从思想上解决这个问题。
    现在各地农业合作社正在制订、修订1958年生产计划和远景规划。各级领导机关有责任帮助农业合作社正确地处理集体副业和社员家庭副业之间的关系。最重要的是根据统筹兼顾、适当安排的原则，对于农、林、牧业和副业做出全面规划。各个农业合作社通过全面规划，可以明确规定经营的范围：凡是大型的、长期性的副业，应由社经营起来；较小的副业，可以由生产队经营；零星的、日常的副业，可由社员个人经营。农业合作社对于社员家庭副业，既不能限制过多，也不能放任不管，它的责任是帮助社员适当地安排家庭副业，特别是要多帮助困难户发展家庭副业。应当使每个社员在不妨害社的集体利益的条件下发展家庭副业。为了做到这点，除了要做思想教育以外，还有必要经过群众民主讨论，对于自留地面积、社员家庭肥料、社员外出做短工、社员在社里出工的日数等等具体问题，做出必要的规定。
