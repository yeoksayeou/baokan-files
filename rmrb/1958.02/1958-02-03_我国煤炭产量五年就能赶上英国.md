China's Coal Production Will Catch Up with Britain in Five Years
　　Wang Huadong
    Recently, The Times of Britain commented on the issue that the output of China's major industrial products might catch up with or surpass Britain within fifteen years. After admitting that they would definitely be defeated, they said with extremely heavy hearts: "We had better pay attention, there may soon be a giant dragon following closely behind us." Indeed, that dragon is already closely following Britain and will catch up with Britain.
    We have calculated that if we want to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, the average annual development rate of the coal industry needs to be 4.3% based on the current production level. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the average annual growth rate of coal production in China was 15.1%. If we can maintain such a growth rate in the future or even slightly lower, we will be able to catch up in less than fifteen years.
    To know how many years it will take for China's coal production to catch up with Britain, it is very necessary to analyze and study the specific situation of the British coal industry. The British coal industry has a history of more than two hundred years and is one of the three basic industrial sectors (textile, steel, and coal) and the foundation of the British industrial economy. In the 19th century, Britain's coal production always ranked first in the world, reaching its peak in 1913, the year before the First World War, with an output of 292 million tons
  (some say 287 million tons). As early as 1872, it produced 124 million tons of coal, more than the output of China's last year of the First Five-Year Plan in 1957 by more than one million tons. This means that, in terms of output, Britain is eighty-five years ahead of China. However, the British coal industry gradually declined after 1913. Although the coal industry was nationalized under capitalism from 1947, and production slightly recovered, due to various subjective and objective restrictions, such as labor shortage, outdated technology and equipment, insufficient investment, and a slump in exports, according to the revised development plan proposed by the British National Coal Board in 1956, it could only produce 250 million tons by 1970, which is less than the level of 1913. If we look at the overall situation in the past forty years, British coal production has not increased but decreased; if we look at it in stages, it fluctuates. Let's put aside the declining aspect of British coal production and only look at the growing aspect, its development rate is also very slow. For example, from 1872 to the peak in 1913, it only increased by 13.5% after forty-one years. From 1947 to 1956, when capitalism was nationalized, it was the ten years of faster recovery after the war, but it only increased by 14.4%; and from 1956 to 1970, it is expected to increase by only 16.2% after fourteen years, which is only 2% more than the average annual growth rate during China's First Five-Year Plan period. Few new coal mines have been built in Britain in recent decades, and even fewer large-scale new coal mines (the largest annual output does not exceed one million tons). Analyzing the output from 1948, only 5% of the output was produced by new mines built after 1928; only 1% of the output was produced by new mines built after 1938. This means that the output increased by new mines in twenty years was only 12.5 million tons. In the ten years from 1947 to 1956, only fourteen new mines, twelve adits, and one hundred and thirty-seven restored mines were built (and about thirty continued construction mines). From 1955 to 1957, eighteen mines were renovated. In order to reach an output of 250 million tons by 1970, it is still necessary to build thirty-eight new mines, fifty adits, and renovate two hundred and fifty mines. Where the investment needed to build and renovate these mines will come from is worth considering. Because Britain's gold and dollar reserves have been declining since the second half of 1954, and half of the investment in the nine years before 1956 came from loans, it is still a question whether it can continue to rely on loans in the future. On the other hand, the shallow coal seams in British coalfields are almost exhausted, and the average mine is now 150 meters deeper than Chinese mines, and the British coal seams are relatively thin, averaging only 1.17 meters, and the thinnest is only 0.46 meters. Because the mines are deeper and the coal seams are thinner, the development of production is greatly limited. As for the fact that Britain's coal reserves are small, only equivalent to one-seventh of China's, that will not have much impact on whether it can develop in recent decades.
    Britain has always been a coal exporting country, mainly exporting to France and Italy, and also occupies a dominant position in the Scandinavian market. In the past ten years, on the one hand, it has been squeezed by American monopoly capital, and the coal exported by the United States to Western Europe from 1946 to 1955 has exceeded 200 million tons. On the other hand, the countries participating in the so-called "European Coal and Steel Community" have seen their coal production rise faster in recent years, which has also had a great impact on Britain. In 1913, Britain's coal exports accounted for 55% of the world's coal exports at that time, and 61.23 million tons were exported in 1929. But after that, it declined, and only 1.07 million tons were exported in 1947 after the Second World War. According to Britain's wishes, it attempted to restore the export volume to more than 40 million tons, but this wish was never realized. More than 10 million tons were still exported in 1955. In 1956 and 1957, it continued to decline. Of course, the reduction in exports is only one of several reasons for the failure of the British coal industry to develop.
    Let's look at the specific situation of China's coal industry. Although the foundation of China's coal industry is very poor, and it suffered serious damage from the enemy before the national liberation; under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, after only a short three-year economic recovery period, the output exceeded the highest level in history, and now it is developing forward at an astonishing speed. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the original plan was to increase the output by an average of 12.5% per year, but the actual average increase was 15.1%. Especially in 1957, after the rectification movement was carried out in coal mines across the country, the political and ideological consciousness of the workers was raised, and the enthusiasm for production was even higher. The national output reached more than 123.6 million tons. If the output of local small coal mines is included, it is about twice that of 1952 and four times that of the early days of liberation in 1949, exceeding the output stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan for 1957 by more than 10 million tons. The average annual growth rate during the Second Five-Year Plan period will be even higher. According to calculations and estimates, the coal output will reach 230 million tons by 1962. If calculated based on the amount of overproduction in the past five years, the output in 1962 will be at least 240 million tons or more. This means that by 1962, it will be possible to catch up with or exceed Britain's output. If we further calculate and estimate the long-term plan for the development of China's coal industry, the coal output will be at least 400 million tons or more by 1967, which will leave Britain far behind.
    During the First Five-Year Plan period, China built, renovated, and restored a total of about 500 mines and open-pit mines, with an annual production capacity of more than 117 million tons. Among them, state-owned coal mines built more than 130 new mines and open-pit mines, with an annual production capacity of more than 50 million tons. Considering that more coal will be needed in all aspects in the future, the annual production capacity of new mines and open-pit mines will increase even more during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Such continuous large-scale construction of new coal mines is also beyond Britain's reach.
    In terms of geological resources, China has extremely favorable conditions. According to preliminary investigation, China's coal reserves are more than one trillion tons, ranking third in the world. At the same time, China's coal seams have good occurrence conditions, with many large coalfields and thick coal seams. Coalfields like the Shanxi coalfield with more than 600 billion tons, and the Fushun and Urumqi coalfields with a maximum thickness of 120 meters are rare in the world. This ensures that China's coal industry can develop without limits.
    Based on the above analysis, it shows that China's coal production is not only completely possible to catch up with Britain in a very short time - within five years, but also has extremely broad development prospects. "Leaving the imperialist countries far behind" will not be a distant matter.

### 我国煤炭产量五年就能赶上英国

　　我国煤炭产量五年就能赶上英国
　　汪华东
    最近，英国泰晤士报评论我国重要工业产品的产量可能在十五年内赶上或超过英国的问题，他们在承认自己必定要打败仗以后，以极其沉重的心情说：“我们最好还是加以注意，可能很快就有一条巨龙紧跟在我们的后面。”不错，那条巨龙现在就已紧跟在英国的后面，而且将赶到英国的前面了。
    我们曾经计算过，如果要在十五年内赶上英国，在目前的生产水平上，每年煤炭工业平均需要发展的速度是4.3％。在第一个五年计划期间，我国煤炭的产量平均每年发展的速度是15.1％。如果今后还能保持这样的发展速度或者稍微再低一些，那么不需要十五年就能够赶上。
    要知道我国煤炭产量究竟需要多少年可以赶上英国，对英国煤炭工业的具体情况加以分析研究是非常必要的。英国煤炭工业已有二百多年历史，是三大基本工业部门（纺织、钢铁和煤炭）之一，也是英国工业经济的基础。在十九世纪，英国煤炭产量一直占世界第一位，发展到第一次世界大战前一年的1913年达到最高峰，产量为二亿九千二百万吨
  （也有说是二亿八千七百万吨的）。远在1872年，就生产煤炭一亿二千四百万吨，比我国第一个五年计划最后一年的1957年产量还多一百多万吨。这就是说，从产量方面看，英国要比我国先进八十五年。不过英国煤炭工业在1913年以后就逐渐衰退了。虽然从1947年起，对煤炭工业实行资本主义国有化，产量稍稍恢复，但由于受着种种主客观条件的限制，如劳动力缺乏、技术设备陈旧、投资不足和出口量一蹶不振等，根据英国国家煤矿总局1956年提出的修正开发计划，直到1970年也只能生产二亿五千万吨，还不到1913年的水平。如果从近四十年总的情况来看，英国煤炭产量不是上升而是下降的；如果分阶段看，则是起伏不定的。我们姑且抛开英国煤炭产量下降的一方面不谈，单就增长的一方面看，其发展速度也很慢。如从1872年到1913年的最高峰，经过四十一年只增长了13.5％。自实行资本主义国有化的1947年到1956年，是战后恢复较快的十年，也只增长了14.4％；而从1956年到1970年，预计经过十四年只能增长16.2％，比我国第一个五年计划期间平均一年增长速度不过多2％。英国近几十年新建的煤矿很少，新建的大型煤矿更少（最大的年产量不超过一百万吨）。从1948年的产量来分析，其中只有5％的产量是由1928年以后新建矿井生产的；只有1％的产量是由1938年以后新建矿井生产的。这就是说，二十年中新建矿井增加的产量只有一千二百五十万吨。自1947年到1956年的十年中间，只新建矿井十四处，平峒十二处，恢复矿井一百三十七处（还有约三十处续建矿井）。从1955年到1957年又改建矿井十八处。为了使1970年产量能达到二亿五千万吨，还需要新建矿井三十八处、平峒五十处，改建矿井二百五十处。而要新建、改建这些矿井需要的投资从何而来是值得考虑的。因为英国从1954年下半年起黄金美元的储量就下降了，在1956年以前九年中间的投资，有半数是从借贷得来的，究竟今后还能不能继续依靠借贷还是个问题。另一方面，英国煤田的浅部煤层已快采完，现在一般矿井平均要比我国矿井深一百五十公尺，而且英国煤层比较薄，平均只有一点一七公尺，最薄的只有零点四六公尺。由于矿井开采比较深、同时煤层又比较薄，就使生产的发展受到很大的限制。至于英国煤的储量少，只相当于我国的七分之一，那对近几十年能否发展还没有多大关系。
    英国一直是煤的输出国家，主要输往法国、意大利，在斯堪的纳维亚市场上也占着统治地位。近十年来，一方面受美国垄断资本的排挤，从1946到1955年美国输往西欧的煤炭在二亿吨以上。另一方面参加所谓“欧洲煤钢联营”的国家年来煤产量上升较快，也给英国以很大影响。在1913年，英国输出的煤曾占当时全世界煤的输出量的55％，1929年还输出了六千一百二十三万吨。但是此后就走下坡路，到第二次世界大战后的1947年只输出一百零七万吨。根据英国的愿望，企图把输出量恢复到四千万吨以上，但这个愿望始终无法实现。在1955年还输出一千万吨以上。1956年、1957年又继续下降。当然，输出减少只是英国煤炭工业不能发展的若干原因之一。
    这里再看我国煤炭工业的具体情况。我国煤炭工业的基础虽然很差，在全国解放以前，又遭受敌人的严重破坏；但在党和人民政府的正确领导下，只经过短短三年经济恢复时期，产量便超过了历史上最高水平，现在正以惊人的速度向前发展。第一个五年计划期间，原计划每年平均增加产量12.5％，结果平均增加了15.1％，特别是1957年，全国煤矿开展了整风运动后，职工提高了政治思想觉悟，生产热情更加高涨。全国产量达到了一亿二千三百六十多万吨。如包括地方小煤窑产量，约为1952年的两倍、解放初期1949年的四倍，比第一个五年计划规定1957年的产量超过了千多万吨。第二个五年计划期间平均每年增长速度还要高些，根据推算和估计，到1962年将产煤二亿三千万吨。如果根据过去五年超产的数量推算，则1962年产量至少当在二亿四千万吨以上。这就是说，到1962年已可赶上或超过英国的产量。如果再推算和估计我国煤炭工业发展的远景计划，到1967年至少产煤四亿吨以上，那就将把英国远远地抛在后面了。
    第一个五年计划期间，我国新建、改建和恢复的矿井和露天矿共约五百处，年生产能力达一亿一千七百多万吨。其中国营煤矿新建矿井和露天矿有一百三十多处，年生产能力达五千多万吨。考虑到今后各方面需要煤量更多，第二个五年计划期间，新建矿井和露天矿的年生产能力将增加得更多。这样不断大规模建设新煤矿，也是英国望尘莫及的。
    在地质资源方面，我国有着极其优越的条件。据初步查明，我国煤的储藏量在一万亿吨以上，占世界第三位。同时我国煤层的赋存条件好，大块煤田和厚煤层多。像山西煤田那样达六千亿吨以上、抚顺和乌鲁木齐煤田那样最厚达一百二十公尺，在全世界都是很少见的。这就保证我国煤炭工业能够无限制地发展。
    根据上述情况分析，说明我国煤炭产量不但完全有可能在很短的时间——五年以内赶上英国，而且还有着极其远大的发展前途。“把帝国主义国家远远地抛在后面”，将不是很遥远的事了。
