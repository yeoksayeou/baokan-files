A Great Victory for Language Reform
Representative Tao Menghe Proposes Vigorously Promoting the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme

I completely agree with and support the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang, as well as the draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme submitted by Premier Zhou Enlai to the Congress for deliberation. I suggest that the Congress approve these four reports and one scheme.

Language reform is a major matter for our country. We are striving to carry out the great socialist construction, and we are conducting reforms and construction in every aspect of ideology, politics, economy, and culture. Language reform is a part of the cultural construction undertaking, and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is an important link in language reform.

The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is a powerful tool for facilitating the learning and use of Chinese.

The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has established a set of phonetic symbols for Chinese, which helps with literacy and unifies pronunciation. The appearance of this set of letters provides favorable conditions for learning and using Chinese in the future, and opens a door to convenience. It will certainly have a great promoting effect on the future development of Chinese.

One of the characteristics of Chinese characters used by the Han people for thousands of years is that they do not belong to the phonetic writing system. They only have strokes but no letters, so they cannot express pronunciation themselves. This characteristic of Chinese characters is also their weakness. Although it is said that Chinese characters have categories such as pictographs and phonetic loans, in the long years, the forms and sounds of Chinese characters have continuously evolved, gradually losing their original appearance, and have long become what Mr. Lu Xun called "non-pictographic pictographs and non-homophonic phonetic characters." Therefore, the image of Chinese characters is extremely limited and unreliable in helping to learn Chinese characters. Because Chinese characters do not mark pronunciation, they are more difficult to learn, recognize, remember, and write compared with phonetic writing. Because Chinese characters are difficult to learn, two situations arise. One situation is that learning Chinese characters is slower than learning phonetic characters, and it takes more time, which causes a loss of time in learning Chinese characters. As for the difference in the time spent learning Chinese characters and learning phonetic characters, and how much more time it takes, there is no precise and reliable experiment that can be used as a basis for estimation. But in any case, the years that the Chinese people have to pay extra due to the difficulty of learning Chinese characters, when added up, must be enormous and shocking. This situation is extremely unfavorable to us and must be eliminated. If it cannot be eliminated, it must be alleviated. In today's efforts to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, this situation cannot be allowed to continue, especially. Another situation is that because Chinese characters are difficult to learn, many people are intimidated and do not learn them, or do not have enough time to learn them well, and become illiterate. This is another extremely unfavorable situation. In our socialist society, everyone wants to read and write, and the illiteracy left over from the old society is decreasing. Of course, this condition that produces illiteracy should no longer exist. In order to correct these two unfavorable situations, it is absolutely necessary to formulate a set of letters to phonetically transcribe Chinese, so that people can easily learn it, in order to remedy the weakness of Chinese characters not expressing pronunciation.

Another major function of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is to phonetically transcribe Chinese, promote Putonghua (Mandarin), and gradually unify the language nationwide. This is also an important task in our country's cultural construction.

It can be seen that the set of letters formulated by the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme provides a powerful tool for everyone, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, or nationality, to learn and use Chinese. It is quite obvious that this tool does not harm Chinese in any way. On the contrary, it is precisely a powerful force for expanding Chinese learning and strengthening Chinese usage.

The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme solves the difficulties of Chinese mechanization, phonetic transcription of Chinese characters, and transliteration of Chinese characters.

Chinese characters only have strokes but no letters. After the square characters are broken down, the scattered strokes cannot be arranged. Due to this characteristic, Chinese characters are difficult to mechanize. Everyone knows that Chinese typewriters are not as flexible as phonetic typewriters. Chinese typesetting work, compared with mechanized phonetic typesetting work that combines type casting and typesetting, is many times slower. The sending and receiving of Chinese character telegrams requires two more translation procedures than phonetic telegrams, which requires more labor, more time, and is prone to errors. Today, mechanized and automated methods of language and text communication are advancing rapidly in the world, making speeds faster and labor savings greater. Under this circumstance, we certainly cannot be content with being backward and must break through this limitation of Chinese characters being unsuitable for mechanization. When there is a need for mechanization, the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme can help us solve this problem: that is, writing Chinese as phonetic characters to adapt to mechanization.

The function of Chinese characters in phonetic transcription is the weakest. The transliterated words in our old classics are mostly inconvenient to remember and often inaccurate. For example, in the History of the Yuan Dynasty, the Chinese transliterations of a large number of personal and place names, and the large number of philosophical and religious terms and personal and place names in Buddhism, are the most headache-inducing for readers. In the past 100 years, a large number of foreign personal and place names, and scientific and technological terms have poured into the country. We should be grateful to the countless unsung heroes who have spent their efforts to determine the Chinese transliterations of these terms for our use.

But unfortunately, Chinese character transliteration is ultimately difficult to satisfy people. Chinese character transliteration is very difficult to remember and write, and sometimes causes confusion and inconvenience in use due to the coexistence of different transliterations by different people. Due to the increasing development of international life today, new foreign personal and place names appear in newspapers and periodicals every day. Due to the progress of science and technology around the world, new phenomena, new substances, new things, and new terms to represent them are constantly emerging. The vast majority of these terms need to be transliterated. Chinese character transliteration work is extremely huge, but it is laborious, unrewarding, and not easy to remember. The set of letters in the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme will certainly be competent and happy to transliterate these large numbers of personal and place names and scientific and technological terms.

The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme helps us to recognize characters and unify pronunciation. At the same time, it can also bear many tasks that Chinese characters cannot bear, or can only barely bear but cannot satisfy people. The role of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is obviously to supplement the deficiencies of Chinese characters and is helpful to the Chinese language.

The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is the latest change in the evolution of Chinese. It introduces a new element into Chinese, keeping it forever young.

Language and writing are indispensable tools for conveying human thoughts and feelings, and they serve human needs. In order to maintain its function, language and writing must advance with the times and must constantly change and progress according to people's needs for it. Changes in language and writing can take various forms. They can be increased, decreased, or changed. To keep it forever vigorous and not rigid, language and writing must be in constant change. Chinese has undergone countless changes in its long and glorious historical process, which is proof of this. The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is the latest change in the evolution of Chinese. This scheme establishes a set of phonetic symbols for Chinese, which provides a powerful tool for 600 million people to learn and use Chinese, introduces a new element into Chinese, keeps it forever young, and can serve the people more competently. There is no doubt that such a change is absolutely necessary and should be warmly welcomed.

Finally, it should be pointed out that people have wanted a formal phonetic transcription scheme for Chinese for many years, but it was not until today that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme was formulated. This is the last great victory of the language reform movement in the past sixty years. This victory is inseparable from the correct guidance of the Party, the hard work of experts and scholars, and the enthusiastic support and discussion of people from all walks of life. We should cherish this scheme, vigorously promote its use, and give full play to its role in enriching and strengthening our Chinese language.

　　文字改革的一次伟大胜利
    陶孟和代表建议大力推行汉语拼音方案
    我完全同意并拥护李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理和吴玉章主任所作的报告，和周恩来总理提请大会审议的汉语拼音方案草案。我建议大会对这四个报告和一个方案都予以通过。
    文字改革是我们国家一件大事情。我们正在为进行伟大的社会主义建设而奋斗，在思想、政治、经济、文化的每个方面进行改造和建设。文字改革是文化建设事业里的一部分，而汉语拼音方案就是文字改革的一个重要环节。
    汉语拼音方案是一项便利学习和使用汉语的有力工具
    汉语拼音方案为汉语制定了一套注音字母，帮助识字和统一读音。这套字母的出现对于今后学习和使用汉语提供一个有利条件，打开一个方便之门。它对将来汉语的发展也一定会发生极大的推动作用。
    汉民族几千年来所使用的汉字的一个特点，就是它不属于拼音文字体系，它只有笔画而无字母，因此它本身就不能表示发音。汉字的这个特点，也就是它的弱点。虽说汉字有所谓象形、谐音等等类别，但在长久的年代里，汉字形声不断演变，逐渐走失原样，早已成为鲁迅先生所说的“不象形的象形字，不谐声的谐声字了”。所以汉字的形象对于学习汉字的帮助是极其有限的，不可靠的。由于汉字不标志发音，所以汉字同拼音文字比较起来就难学、难认、难记、难写。由于汉字难学，就产生了两种情况。一种情况是学习汉字比较学习拼音字要慢些，要多耗费时日，使学习汉字在时间上蒙受损失。关于学习汉字和学习拼音字所费时日的差别如何，要多费多少时日，还没有精确可靠的试验可以作为估计的依据。但是无论如何，中国人民由于汉字难学而必须额外付出的年月，总计起来，一定是庞大得惊人的。这种情况对我们极端不利，必须设法消除，不能消除，也须减轻。在争取多、快、好、省的今天，尤其不能容许这个情况继续下去。另一种情况就是因为汉字难学，所以有许多人就望而生畏，不去学它，或者没有充分的时间把它学好，而成了文盲。这又是一个极端不利的情况。在我们的社会主义社会里，人人要求读书识字，旧社会遗留下来的文盲正在减少，这个产生文盲的条件当然更不应该继续存在。为改正这两种不利情况，制定一套字母，给汉语注音，使人们容易学习它，以补救汉字不表示发音这个弱点是绝对必要的。
    汉语拼音方案的又一重大功用是为汉语注音，推广普通话，在全国范围内，逐步统一语言。这也是我国文化建设的一项重要工作。
    由此可见，汉语拼音方案制定的这一套字母，使一切的人，无论男女老幼，无论汉族或少数民族，无论中国人或外国人，对于学习和使用汉语得到一个有力的工具。十分显然，这个工具不是使汉语受任何损害，恰恰相反，它正是扩大汉语学习，加强汉语使用的一个强大力量。
    汉语拼音方案解决了汉语机械化、汉字注音、汉字译音中的困难
    汉字只有笔画而无字母，在方块字拆开之后，零散的笔画就无法安排。由于这个特点，汉字就难以机械化。大家都知道，汉文打字机就没有拼音文字打字机那样灵便。汉文排字工作比起机械化的拼音文字排版工作，将铸字和排字并合在一起，要慢多少倍。汉字电报的收发要比拼音文字电报多出两道翻译手续，因此多费劳力、多费时间，而且容易发生错误。机械化、自动化的语言文字交通方法今天正在世界上飞快前进，使速度日益加快，人力日益节省。在此情况之下，我们当然不能自甘落后，必须突破汉字不适于机械化的这个限制。在有机械化的必要时，汉语拼音方案正可以帮助我们解决这个问题：就是把汉语写成拼音字以适应机械化。
    汉字在注音方面的功用是最薄弱的。我国旧典籍里的译音字词大都是不便于记忆，而且常有欠准确。例如在元史里，大批的人名地名，佛教里大量的哲学宗教名词和人名地名的汉字译音，就是最使读者感到头痛的。近一百年来，外国的人名地名，科学技术名词大量涌进国内，有多少无名英雄费了力气，为这些名词定出汉字译音供我们使用，这是应该感谢的。
    但是可惜的是汉字译音终究难以令人满意。汉字译音十分难记、难写，而且有时由于各人译音分歧，同时并存，在使用上引起了混乱和不方便。由于今天国际生活的日益发展，新的外国人名地名每天要在报刊上出现。由于全世界的科学技术的进步，新的现象，新的物质，新的事物，以及表示它们的新的名词，每天正在源源不断地出现。这些名词的极大部分都是要音译的。汉字音译工作至为繁巨，然而又吃力，又不讨好，而且不易记忆。汉语拼音方案的一套字母，为这些大量的人名地名和科学技术名词译音，一定是胜任愉快的。
    汉语拼音方案帮助我们识字和统一读音，同时它还可以负担许多汉字所不能负担、或只能勉强负担而不能使人满意的任务。汉语拼音方案的作用显然是补汉字的不足，是有助于汉语的。
    汉语拼音方案是汉语变迁上一次新的变动　它给汉语引进一个新的因素，使它永远保持青春
    语言文字是传达人类思想感情必不可少的工具，是为人类的需要服务的。为保持它的功用，语言文字，必须跟着时代前进，必须按着人对它的需要不断地改变，不断地进步。语言文字的改变可以有各种各样的方式，可以有所增加，也可以有所减少，也可以有所改变。要使它永远保有活力而不至僵化，语言文字必须时时在变化之中。汉语在它的悠久的光荣的历史过程里，就曾经经过不计其数的变化，这就是一个证明。汉语拼音方案就是汉语变迁上一次最新的变动。这个方案给汉语制定一套注音字母，这对于六万万人是提供一项便利学习和使用汉语的有力工具，对于汉语是引进一个新的因素，使它永远保持青春，并且可以更加胜任地为人民服务。毫无疑问，这样的变动是完全必要的，应该热烈欢迎的。
    最后，应该指出，人们对汉语有正式注音方案出现，想望已经有年了，可是只有到了今天，才制定了汉语拼音方案。这是六十年来文字改革运动最后的一次伟大胜利。这个胜利是和党的正确指导，专家学者的辛勤工作，和各阶层人士的热心赞助和讨论，分不开的。我们应该珍视这个方案，大力推广它的使用，充分发挥它的作用，以丰富并加强我们的汉语。
