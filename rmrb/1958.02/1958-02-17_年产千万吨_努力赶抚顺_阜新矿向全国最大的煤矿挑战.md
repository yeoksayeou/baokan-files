Annual Output of 10 Million Tons: Strive to Catch Up with Fushun
Fuxin Mine Challenges to Become the Largest Coal Mine in the Country

(Our newspaper Shenyang, February 16th, reporter Chen Ji reports): The workers of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, with the heroic spirit of revolution, have repeatedly exceeded the planned targets set by the Ministry of Coal Industry, proposing to strive for a coal output of 10 million tons this year, a plan that is more than 32% higher than the actual output last year. With this goal, they are challenging Fushun Coal Mine, the largest in the country, striving to catch up with Fushun's output.

When the Ministry of Coal Industry first drafted the annual plan for this year, it required the Fuxin Mining Bureau to produce 8.26 million tons of coal this year; later, considering that this requirement could not meet the needs of the country, it was changed to require 8.5 million tons. After preliminary discussions, the workers of the Fuxin Mining Bureau believed that the target of 8.5 million tons was still too conservative, and proactively proposed a plan to the Ministry of Coal Industry for an annual output of 8.8 million tons, striving to reach an annual output of 9.2 million tons. Recently, due to in-depth debates among the workers, this planned target has been exceeded again. Now, the bureau has decided to once again propose to the Ministry of Coal Industry a plan for an annual output of 9.6 million tons, striving to move towards an annual output of 10 million tons. Calculated based on an annual output of 9.6 million tons, this plan is 16.1% higher than the target first required by the Ministry of Coal Industry, and more than 27% higher than the actual output last year.

This leap-forward plan was formulated under the principles of not increasing manpower and not asking for more money. The Shenyang Coal Mining Administration originally promised that the Fuxin Mining Bureau could increase by 450 people this year; now, the Fuxin Mining Bureau has decided not to add a single person and will actually reduce by more than 3,000 people compared to last year (including cadres sent down to the countryside). The bureau's planned targets for the four items of expenses to be paid by the state this year are also the same as the actual expenditures last year, with no increase.

The reason why the workers of the Fuxin Mining Bureau were able to propose such an advanced plan is that they adopted the method of "big blooming and big contending," presenting facts, reasoning, and refuting conservative ideas, thereby uncovering potential capabilities. After the state plan for this year was issued, the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party led the coal mine workers in Fuxin to launch discussions. This discussion was first conducted at the three-level cadre meeting. At the three-level cadre meeting, cadres from the bureau, mine, and pit levels, as well as workers, section chiefs, and technical personnel, sat together to discuss the planned targets face-to-face. Whoever had difficulties, everyone used their brains to solve them together; whoever had conservative ideas, others immediately found evidence and presented advanced examples to specifically criticize them. When Gaode Mine first formulated its plan, it decided to produce 905,000 tons of raw coal annually. At the meeting, workers and section chiefs proposed a target of 916,000 tons annually. At that time, the mine's director and engineers both believed it was impossible. However, the secretary of the mine's Party committee and the chairman of the trade union supported the opinions of the workers and section chiefs. They presented many facts to debate with the mine director and engineers. One worker pointed out in the debate that a pit in the mine had a shock brigade composed of 40 technical workers, who usually had very few tasks, and had no tasks before February this year. The worker asked: Why doesn't the leadership give them tasks? Do they want to lie low? After many such debates, an advanced plan was finally formulated, and the mine director and engineers were also sincerely convinced. This method of leaders and those being led discussing the plan together broke the past convention of a few people formulating the plan, so that various conservative ideas could be discovered and criticized in a timely manner, and the enthusiasm of the masses could be fully reflected in the plan.

In the past, this mining bureau often failed to complete its plan in the first month of each year. This year, the workers said: We made the plan ourselves, so we must work hard to complete it. They tried every means to improve production efficiency as much as possible, so that the January plan was completed by 107%, reaching the level of an annual output of 9.4 million tons. The fact that a large increase in production was achieved in the severe cold season shows that the mining bureau's plan for an annual output of 10 million tons this year can certainly be completed.

Recently, the workers of the Fuxin Mining Bureau put forward a bold slogan: Learn from Fushun! This slogan has attracted great attention from the workers of Fushun Coal Mine. The planned output of Fushun Mining Bureau this year is 10 million tons, only 8.45% higher than the actual output last year. If Fushun Coal Mine does not revise its plan and leap forward, then it may be overtaken by Fuxin Coal Mine. Now it depends on how Fushun Coal Mine responds to this challenge!

### 年产千万吨　努力赶抚顺  阜新矿向全国最大的煤矿挑战

    年产千万吨　努力赶抚顺
    阜新矿向全国最大的煤矿挑战
    本报沈阳16日电　记者陈迹报道：阜新矿务局职工以革命的英雄气概，一再突破煤炭工业部交付的计划指标，提出要在今年争取产煤一千万吨，这个计划比去年实际产量提高32％以上。他们以这个奋斗目标向全国规模最大的抚顺煤矿挑战，争取赶上抚顺的产量。
    去年煤炭工业部第一次拟定今年年度计划的时候，要求阜新矿务局今年产煤八百二十六万吨；后来考虑到这个要求不能适应国家需要，改为要求产煤八百五十万吨。阜新矿务局职工经过初步讨论，认为年产八百五十万吨的指标仍然过于保守，主动地向煤炭工业部提出年产八百八十万吨的计划，并且要争取达到年产九百二十万吨。最近由于职工们深入展开辩论，这个计划指标又被突破了。现在这个局已经决定：再次向煤炭工业部提出年产九百六十万吨的计划，并且争取向年产一千万吨的方向迈进。按年产九百六十万吨计算，这个计划比煤炭工业部第一次要求的指标提高了16.1％，比去年实际产量增加27％以上。
    这个跃进的计划，是在不增加人，不多要钱的原则下拟出来的。沈阳煤矿管理局本来答应阜新矿务局今年可以增加四百五十人；现在阜新矿务局决定不增加一个人，并且要比去年减少三千多人（包括下放到农村的干部）。这个局今年计划要国家支出的四项费用的指标，也和去年实际的支出相同，没有增加。
    阜新矿务局职工所以能提出这样先进的计划，是因为采用了大鸣大放的方式，摆事实，讲道理，驳倒了保守思想，从而挖出了潜在能力。在今年国家计划下达以后，中共阜新市委就领导阜新煤矿职工展开讨论。这种讨论首先是在三级干部会议上进行的。在三级干部会上，局、矿、坑三级干部和工人、段长、技术人员坐在一起，面对面讨论计划指标。谁有困难，大家动脑筋，共同解决；谁有保守思想，别人就当场找出根据，摆出先进事例来具体地加以批判。高德矿第一次拟订计划时，决定年产九十万五千吨原煤。在会上，工人和段长提出了年产九十一万六千吨的指标。当时这个矿的矿长和工程师都认为办不到。矿务局党委书记、工会主席却支持工人、段长的意见。他们摆出了很多事实同矿长、工程师辩论。有个工人在辩论中指出，这个矿有个坑拥有一支四十名技术工人组成的突击队，平时任务很少，今年2月以前又没有任务。这个工人问道：领导上为什么不给他们任务？想要打埋伏吗？这样辩论了多次，终于订出了先进计划，矿长、工程师也心悦口服。这种领导和被领导一起来讨论计划的方式，打破了过去少数人订计划的常规，使各种保守思想能够及时发现和得到批判，群众的积极性也能够充分反映到计划中去。
    过去，这个矿务局每年第一个月往往不能完成计划。今年工人们说：咱们亲自做了计划，一定要努力完成。他们想方设法，尽量提高生产效率，使1月份计划完成了107％，达到了年产九百四十万吨的水平。在严寒季节大量增产的事实，说明这个矿务局今年年产一千万吨的计划一定可以完成。
    最近，阜新矿务局职工提出了一个豪迈的口号：向抚顺看齐！这个口号引起了抚顺煤矿职工极大的注意。今年抚顺矿务局计划产量是一千万吨，仅比去年实际产量增加8.45％。如果抚顺煤矿不修改计划，向前跃进，那末它就可能被阜新煤矿赶上。现在就看抚顺煤矿如何来回答这个挑战了！
