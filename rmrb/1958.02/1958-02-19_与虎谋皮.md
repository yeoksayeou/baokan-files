　　Seeking Skin from a Tiger

　　The scent of oil in the Sahara has long attracted the covetous eyes of American oil monopoly capitalists; this is no secret. The recently published secret letter of the younger Hoover openly revealed the American oil monopoly capitalists' urgent desire to seize the abundant resources of Algeria.

　　Now, an article published in the American big business magazine "Wall Street and Business Analyst" further reveals that many major American oil companies have already occupied important positions in the development of Saharan oil, and that these American companies have an unspeakable collusion with French monopoly capital and government authorities. This collusion, according to the "Wall Street and Business Analyst," is that "American oil companies participating in the development of Saharan oil will become formal partners of the government responsible for maintaining French rule in Algeria"; French monopoly capitalists and government authorities hope to use these "oil companies' influence on their own (American) foreign policy to support French policy in Algeria."

　　It is already obvious to everyone that the United States is constantly transfusing blood into France's war to suppress Algeria. However, the problem is that French monopoly capital and government authorities, blinded by greed, have reached the point where they are attempting to use American oil monopoly capital's interest in Saharan oil to maintain their colonial rule in Algeria; this is truly seeking skin from a tiger. Does anyone not see that once American monopoly capital gains a firm foothold in the Sahara, it will never continue to tolerate French influence in Algeria?

　　It seems that the French ruling clique in Algeria is once again reliving the lesson of Indochina.

    与虎谋皮
    撒哈拉的石油气味早已引得美国的石油垄断资本家们垂涎三尺，这已经不是什么秘密了。前不久发表的小胡佛的秘信，就毫不隐讳地道出了美国石油垄断资本家们急于要攫取阿尔及利亚的丰富资源的野心。
    现在，美国大资本家的杂志“华尔街与商业分析家”所刊登的文章，更透露出美国的许多大石油公司已经在开发撒哈拉石油的事业中占据了重要的位置，而且这些美国公司还同法国垄断资本和政府当局有着不可告人的勾搭。这种勾搭，照“华尔街与商业分析家”的说法是：“参加开发撒哈拉石油的美国石油公司将成为负责维护法国在阿尔及利亚的统治的那个政府的正式伙伴”；法国垄断资本家和政府当局则希望利用这些“石油公司对本国（美国）外交政策的影响来达到支持法国在阿尔及利亚政策的目的”。
    美国为法国镇压阿尔及利亚的战争不断输血，这已是昭昭在人耳目了。但是，问题是法国垄断资本和政府当局，利令智昏到了这种程度，竟然企图利用美国石油垄断资本对撒哈拉石油的兴趣来维持他们在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治，这真正是与虎谋皮了。难道谁还看不出，美国垄断资本一旦在撒哈拉站稳了脚跟，就绝不会继续容忍法国在阿尔及利亚的势力吗？
    看来，法国统治集团在阿尔及利亚又在重温印度支那的那一课了。
