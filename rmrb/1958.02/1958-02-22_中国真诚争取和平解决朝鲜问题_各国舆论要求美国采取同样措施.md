(Xinhua News Agency report) News from Xinhua: Public opinion in various countries hails the decision of the Chinese People's Volunteers to completely withdraw from Korea, considering it a sincere effort by China to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and ease international tensions; at the same time, they demand that the United States also take similar actions.

The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 21st, saying that the Vietnamese people fully support the decision of the Chinese and Korean governments regarding the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea by the end of this year. This decision once again demonstrates that the Chinese and Korean governments have consistently implemented a policy of safeguarding peace with practical actions.

The commentary pointed out that as long as American troops continue to occupy South Korea, the South Korean people will not be able to freely express their desire for the Korean people to unify the country themselves, and Korea will continue to be divided. The commentary said that the Korean issue can be resolved according to the wishes of the Korean people themselves. The statement issued by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5th has put forward appropriate and fully achievable solutions.

The East German "New Era Daily" published an editorial on the 21st, saying that the Sino-Korean agreement on the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea in batches before the end of this year is a huge goodwill action to eliminate the conflict that constantly threatens peace in the Far East. The editorial said that the socialist camp has demonstrated here with action its willingness to ease tensions, and at the same time, this action also poses a serious test for the United States and other countries with troops stationed in South Korea. The Korean issue cannot be resolved by unilateral efforts alone, and all relevant parties should make their own contributions.

Bucharest's "Free Romania" published a commentary on the 21st, saying that the initiative to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea once again proves the sincere desire of the People's Republic of China and Democratic Korea for peaceful reunification of Korea and easing tensions in the Far East, and is also a major effort. The commentary revealed that the United States continues to regard Korea as its colony and use it as a bridgehead for attacking China, and believes that this is why they are unwilling to withdraw troops from Korea and do not want to leave Taiwan, South Vietnam, Japan, and Okinawa.

The Yugoslav "Borba" published a commentary on the 21st, saying that the withdrawal of Chinese troops from North Korea will help resolve major and delicate disputes like the Korean issue. The step taken by China is a concrete contribution to restoring world trust. China's decision is not conditional on the simultaneous withdrawal of foreign troops (i.e., U.S. troops) from South Korea, and China's unconditional and unilateral withdrawal places a moral and political obligation on the other party to take appropriate concrete steps to show that it also hopes to remove the Korean issue from the international dispute agenda.

"Politika" wrote on the 20th: The announcement that Chinese troops will withdraw from North Korea will help ease tensions in Korea, thereby helping to resolve the central issue of Korea, namely the unification of the country. The newspaper said that this expression is an act of goodwill and also a signpost. Can't the other party take the same action?

The joint Sino-Korean statement is very popular in New Delhi, India. Political figures hailed the statement as an action that greatly contributes to easing tensions and reunifying Korea. On the 21st, Delhi newspapers pointed out that this decision is a test for the United States.

The Hindi "Hindustan Daily" said: "We welcome the decision of the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from North Korea. The other party should take the same step."

Another Hindi newspaper, "Naya Bharat Times," said that the Indian people and all those who believe in national independence and sovereignty are particularly pleased with the decision of China and North Korea. The newspaper mentioned the recent statement by the United States that American troops would not withdraw from Korea. It asked: "In view of China's recent decision, who would agree with the above statement by the United States?" "The Hindustan Times" pointed out that after the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers is completed according to plan, "the world will be able to understand more clearly who is obstructing the reunification of Korea."

The Cambodian "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 21st regarding the Chinese government's decision to recommend that the Chinese People's Volunteers withdraw from Korea, saying that this decision more clearly shows that the Chinese government and people sincerely desire peace. The commentary said that world opinion is currently waiting for the United States to take similar measures.

All major West German newspapers on the 20th prominently published the news that the Chinese People's Volunteers would completely withdraw from Korea on the first or second page. Many newspapers published commentaries expressing concern about whether the United States could escape its passive situation.

The "Cologne City News" wrote in a commentary entitled "A Failure": "The unconditional withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers and North Korea's agreement to hold free elections throughout Korea satisfy the main conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea." The newspaper said that due to the initiative of the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw, the West is facing "the threat of a huge failure, which is not only a propaganda failure but also a profound political failure."

The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" editorial wrote that the joint Sino-Korean statement issued a resounding call to the United States, demanding that the United States also withdraw its troops from South Korea. At the same time, the newspaper expressed fear that holding elections throughout Korea would lead to the collapse of the South Korean regime.

    中国真诚争取和平解决朝鲜问题  各国舆论要求美国采取同样措施
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论欢呼关于中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜的决定，认为这是中国为和平解决朝鲜问题和缓和国际紧张局势的真诚努力；同时要求美国也采取同样的行动。
    越南“人民报”21日发表评论说，越南人民完全支持中朝两国政府关于中国人民志愿军在今年年底以前全部撤出朝鲜的决定。这个决定再次表明，中朝两国政府一向以实际行动来贯彻维护和平的政策。
    评论指出，在美国军队还占领着南朝鲜的时候，南朝鲜人民就不可能自由地提出由朝鲜人民自己统一国家的愿望，朝鲜就将继续处于被分割的状态。评论说，朝鲜问题是可以根据朝鲜人民自己的愿望来解决的。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府2月5日的声明已提出了适当的、完全可以实现的解决办法。
    民主德国“新时代日报”21日发表社论说，关于中国人民志愿军在今年年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜的中朝协议，是为消除经常威胁远东和平的冲突的巨大善意行动。社论说，社会主义阵营在这里以行动证明了它对和缓紧张局势的意愿，同时这一行动也对美国和在南朝鲜驻扎军队的其他国家提出了严重的考验。朝鲜问题是不可能只凭单方面的努力而得到解决的，所有有关方面都应该作出它们自己的贡献。
    布加勒斯特“自由罗马尼亚报”21日发表评论说，从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军的倡议，再一次证明了中华人民共和国和民主朝鲜对和平统一朝鲜和和缓远东紧张局势的真诚愿望，并且也是一次重大的努力。评论揭露了美国继续把朝鲜做为自己的殖民地和把它作为进攻中国的桥梁，并且认为这就是他们为什么不愿意从朝鲜撤军，不想离开台湾、南越、日本和冲绳岛的原因。
    南斯拉夫“战斗报”21日发表评论说，中国军队从北朝鲜撤退有助于解决像朝鲜这样重大而微妙的争端。中国所采取的这个步骤是对恢复世界信任的一个具体的贡献。中国的决定并不以外国军队（即美军）同时自南朝鲜撤退为条件，而中国军队无条件和单方面的撤退就使得另一方在道义上和政治上有义务采取适当的具体步骤，来表明它也希望把朝鲜问题从国际争端议程上抹掉。
    “政治报”在20日写道：宣布中国军队将撤出北朝鲜一举有助于缓和朝鲜的紧张局势，从而也有助于解决朝鲜的中心问题，即国家的统一问题。报纸说，这种表示是一种善意的行动，而且还是一个路标。难道对方不能采取同样的行动么？
    中朝两国联合声明在印度首都很受欢迎。政界人士欢呼这个声明是大大有助于和缓紧张局势和重新统一朝鲜的行动。21日德里各报指出这个决定是对美国的一个考验。
    印地文“印度斯坦日报”说：“我们欢迎中国人民志愿军撤出北朝鲜的决定。另一方应当采取同样步骤。”
    另一家印地文报纸“新印度时报”说，印度人民和所有相信国家独立主权的人，都对中朝两国的这个决定感到特别高兴。这家报纸提到美国最近发表的美国军队不会撤出朝鲜的声明。它问道：“鉴于中国最近的这个决定，谁还会赞同美国的上述声明呢？”“印度斯坦时报”指出，在中国人民志愿军的撤退按照计划完成后，“全世界将能够更清楚地了解，究竟是谁阻挠着朝鲜的重新统一”。
    柬埔寨“人民报”21日就中国政府决定建议中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜这件事发表评论说，这项决定更加清楚地表明，中国政府和人民真诚地渴望和平。评论说，世界舆论目前正在等待美国采取同样的措施。
    西德所有主要报纸20日都在第一版或第二版显著刊载了中国人民志愿军将全部撤出朝鲜的消息。许多报纸发表了评论，表示担心美国能否摆脱其被动的处境。
    “科隆市报”在题为“一个失败”的评论中写道：“中国志愿军的无条件撤退和北朝鲜同意在全朝鲜举行自由选举满足了朝鲜和平统一的主要条件。”这家报纸说，由于中国人民志愿军的主动撤退，西方已经面临着“一个巨大失败的威胁，这不仅是一个宣传的失败而且是一个深刻的政治失败”。
    “法兰克福汇报”的社论写道，中朝两国联合声明向美国发出了响亮的号召，要求美国也从南朝鲜撤出它的驻军。同时，这家报纸表示害怕在全朝鲜举行选举将会导致南朝鲜政权的垮台。
