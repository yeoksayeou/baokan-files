    Proposal

    Our hundreds of millions of working people are carrying out earth-shaking socialist construction with overwhelming revolutionary spirit and selfless heroic labor. Everywhere are magnificent scenes of climax after climax, leap forward after leap forward.

    We propose to our brother theatrical troupes across the country: Let us muster revolutionary vigor and, like workers and peasants making great leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production, let us also have a great leap forward in artistic work. We will resolutely overcome bourgeois ideologies and work styles and all extravagant and wasteful phenomena, implement the policy of running undertakings with diligence and thrift, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art, and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," enrich the repertoire, strengthen artistic practice, continuously improve the quality of performances, bring art to factories and rural areas, meet the people's growing cultural needs, coordinate with and support the country's socialist construction, and, starting from 1958, achieve complete self-sufficiency, without any subsidies from the state, and strive for a surplus. Many state-owned and folk professional theatrical troupes in some provinces and cities have long been self-sufficient and are leading the way. We must humbly learn from them and strive to catch up with them. We also suggest that all brother theatrical troupes that are still receiving state subsidies should muster revolutionary vigor, vigorously increase production and practice economy, and those with the conditions to be self-sufficient should immediately become self-sufficient; those who cannot yet be self-sufficient should do so in the shortest possible time. We also put forward the following guarantees to encourage our brother organizations:

    1. Resolutely implement the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and ensure that a minimum of one-quarter of the time each year (or performances) is spent on touring factories and rural areas, going deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers. When performing in urban theaters, we must also strive to expand the audience of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    2. Enrich the repertoire, improve the ideological and artistic quality of the repertoire, actively stage new plays reflecting current struggles, excavate and reorganize traditional plays, and constantly improve the level of performances.
    3. Run undertakings diligently and thriftily, strengthen planning management and economic accounting, reform systems, give full play to potential, increase performances, increase income, eliminate waste, save expenses, ensure self-sufficiency, and strive for a surplus every year.
    4. Ensure that the original average wage income level of artists and other staff members of this unit is not reduced.
    5. Strengthen political, professional, and cultural learning, strive for labor training, improve socialist consciousness, and strive for members of the troupe to quickly become both red and expert art workers.

    China Youth Art Theater, China Pingju Theater, China Peking Opera Theater, China Acrobatic Troupe, Shanghai Huai Opera Troupe, Shaanxi Provincial Opera Theater, Guangzhou Drama Troupe, Jiangsu Provincial Peking Opera Troupe, Jiangxi Gan Opera Troupe, and other forty art performance groups.

    倡议书
    我国亿万劳动人民正以排山倒海的革命气概，忘我的英雄劳动，进行着惊天动地的社会主义建设，到处都是高潮接高潮，跃进又跃进的壮丽图景。
    我们向全国兄弟剧团提出倡议：我们鼓足革命干劲，像工人农民使工农业生产大跃进一样，在艺术工作上也来个大跃进。我们将坚决克服资产阶级思想作风和一切铺张浪费现象，贯彻勤俭办事业、文艺为工农兵服务和“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针，丰富上演剧目，加强艺术实践，不断提高演出质量，把艺术送到工厂、送到农村，满足人民日益增长的文化生活要求，配合和支援国家的社会主义建设，并且从1958年起，作到完全自给自足，不要国家任何补助，进而争取有所盈余。有不少省市的国营剧团和民间职业剧团，他们早已自给自足，走在前面，我们一定要虚心地向他们学习，努力赶上他们。我们并且建议凡是目前仍然领取国家补助的兄弟剧团，鼓起革命干劲，厉行增产节约，有条件可以自给的立即自给；还不能自给的要在尽可能短的时间内做到自给。我们并且提出下列保证，来同兄弟团体共勉。
    1、坚决贯彻为工农兵服务的方针，保证每年最低限度有四分之一的时间（或演出场次）下厂下乡巡回演出，深入工农兵，在城市剧场演出时也要努力扩大工农兵观众面。2、丰富上演剧目，提高剧目的思想性和艺术性，积极上演反映现实斗争的新剧目，挖掘和整理传统剧目，不断地提高演出水平。3、勤俭办事业，加强计划管理和经济核算，革新制度，充分发挥潜力，增加演出，增加收入，杜绝浪费，节约开支，保证自足自给，并力争年年有盈余。4、保证不降低本单位艺术工作者和其他工作人员的原来的平均工资收入的水平。5、加强政治、业务、文化学习，努力劳动锻炼，提高社会主义觉悟，争取剧团成员迅速成为又红又专的艺术工作者。
    中国青年艺术剧院、中国评剧院、中国京剧院、中国杂技团、上海淮剧团、陕西省戏曲剧院、广州话剧团、江苏省京剧团、江西赣剧团等四十个艺术表演团体。
