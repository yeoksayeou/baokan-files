Workers of Hongshan Coal Mine Prepare for Continuous Great Leap Forward
    Speech by Representative Cui Dexi

    I completely agree with the reports made to the congress by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, as well as Old Wu’s report on the issue of writing reform, and the report on the examination of representative qualifications. I suggest that the congress approve these documents.

    Now, I will only report to the representatives on some situations of the Hongshan Coal Mine where I work.

    (I)
    Facts Prove the Past is Not Like the Present
    In the Past, All Labor was Manual and Lives Were Not Guaranteed
    Now, Most is Mechanized and Death Has Been Eliminated
    The May 4th Coal Mining Team Was Named a National Advanced Coal Mining Team

    The Hongshan Coal Mine used to be a very dilapidated and backward enterprise. Before liberation, all production processes relied on manual labor. The production capacity was very low, the safety facilities were very poor, and the lives of workers were not guaranteed. In the year with the highest record, an average of one worker died every day. The living and working conditions of the workers were unimaginable.

    After liberation, because ours is a country led by the working class, reducing the labor intensity of workers and ensuring safe production have always been regarded as important issues. Over the years, the state has continuously invested in the mine, and by the end of 1957, about 90% of various heavy physical labor had been replaced by machinery. As a result, the production level has been greatly improved. The output in 1957 increased by nearly 30% compared with 1953. The mine has increased many safety facilities. The strict implementation of operating procedures and safety regulations has resulted in a gradual decline in the casualty rate, and by 1957, deaths had been eliminated.

    Reduced labor intensity and guaranteed life, this is the most important thing for coal miners. In the past, it was simply unimaginable. Thanks to the state's concern for workers, the education of workers in various political movements, especially the victory of the socialist transformation upsurge in 1956, the socialist ideological awareness of all employees has been greatly enhanced. In addition, the nationwide rectification movement carried out in 1957 further inspired the determination of employees to build socialism, and their production enthusiasm soared. The task of the first five-year plan was completed 96 days ahead of schedule, increasing coal production by more than 192,300 tons for the country.

    During the first five-year plan period, many advanced examples emerged in our mine. For example, the May 4th Coal Mining Team was named the national advanced coal mining team. The May 4th team completed a total of 2,330 cycles in the first five-year plan, the recovery progress reached 4,221.3 meters, and the coal production was 654,628 tons, exceeding the national plan by 42,119 tons. It completed the first five-year plan five months and seven days ahead of schedule. In 1957, the recovery efficiency increased by 74.6% compared with 1953, the consumption of pit props decreased by 49%, and deaths and major production accidents were eliminated. Several advanced groups emerged. According to the production level in 1957, the working face efficiency reached about 7 tons at the end of the year, with an average of 5.807 tons for twelve months. Hongshan is a thin coal seam area of ​​80 cm to 100 cm. Under such conditions, the general efficiency in China is about 4 tons. The May 4th team not only exceeded this level, but also exceeded the British coal mining progress in 1955 and the efficiency of mechanized sites of 5.78 tons.

    What are the main reasons for the high working face efficiency of the May 4th team? Through the continuous efforts of workers and technicians, they roughly explored the following two points: First, they vigorously implemented regular cycle operations, so that the underground coal cutting, support, pile dropping, scraper conveyor moving, pillar removal, and roof release processes can be organically combined and scientifically connected. To achieve this requirement, the following measures were taken: (1) Improve the utilization rate of coal mining machinery, achieve fast coal cutting and fast scraper conveyor moving, and ensure that the scraper conveyor moves straight, flat, and stable. As a result, the utilization rate of coal mining machinery in Hongshan reached 69%, exceeding the general level of 48.7% in the country. (2) Ensure timely supply of mine cars, so that the mined coal can be hoisted up in time. For this purpose, the transportation and maintenance area and the coal mining area have signed mine car supply contracts. (3) In order to ensure regular cycles and give full play to the efficiency of labor, we organized reserve teams. When each fixed coal mining team encounters geological changes or insufficient attendance, we transfer manpower from the reserve team to supplement it. When each fixed coal mining team has surplus labor for some reason, it is invested in the non-regular face production of the reserve team. This not only ensures regular cycles, but also avoids waiting for work. (4) Constantly strengthen the education of regular cycle operations. If this idea is consolidated, the determination to ensure regular cycles will be greater. Therefore, often when it is apparent that the cycle may be disrupted, workers do everything possible to overcome difficulties and strive for regular cycles, which ensures coal mining efficiency. Second, labor competitions are carried out in the team, and various advanced experiences are promoted. If the movement is carried out well, the regular cycle will be more guaranteed, and more coal can be produced.

    (II)
    New Initiative of the May 4th Coal Mining Team
    Launch a Competition of "Ten Thousand Tons per Face, Full Cycle"
    Promote the Mine to Enter a Production Upsurge and Break Quotas
    Leading Cadres Overcome Conservative Ideas and Revise Plans

    The above achievements have not made us feel satisfied. We know that China's coal industry production is far from being able to meet the needs of the ever-developing industrial and agricultural production and the daily necessities of the people. In particular, since Chairman Mao put forward the great call to catch up with or surpass Britain in terms of the output of steel and other major industrial products in the next fifteen years or a little longer, we have felt that our responsibility is even greater, because no matter steelmaking, power generation, or transportation, no industry can do without coal. Coal is the food of industry, so the workers of our entire mine have become even more enthusiastic and revolutionary to welcome the second five-year plan.

    In order to deeply implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily with more, faster, better, and more economical results, the May 4th Coal Mining Team proposed to the coal miners of the entire mine and the province to launch a competition of "ten thousand tons per face, full cycle." The targets they proposed for 1958 are:
    1. The annual coal production is 123,255 tons, an increase of 19.8% compared with the production level in 1957, reaching the level of 10,000 tons per month per face; the recovery efficiency is 5.8 tons, an increase of 6.17% compared with the national plan.
    2. Three hundred and fifty-one working days per year, complete three hundred and thirty-nine cycles, with a progress of six hundred and seventy-eight meters.
    3. Improve the quality of coal, and reduce the gangue content by 0.5% compared with the national plan.
    4. Reduce costs and save 120 cubic meters of pit props; the consumption per ton reaches 0.00943 cubic meters.
    5. Ensure safe production and eliminate major personal and production accidents.

    Under the promotion of the May 4th team, more than 70% of the groups in the entire mine formulated guarantee plans in December (now it is certainly more than this number). In December last year, 96% of the groups that formulated plans exceeded the quotas. For example, the First Shaft Excavation Area exceeded the plan by 157 meters in December, exceeding the increased production plan by 55 meters, saving 29 cubic meters of pit props, and the production efficiency increased by 18% compared with the plan, creating the highest production month of the year in this area. For another example, the First Well Excavation Second Group, in order to solve the long-standing problem of excavation lagging behind recovery, studied and learned from advanced experiences, which greatly improved the excavation efficiency. In December, it had reached 165% of the quota. The coal cutting machine group of the Fifth and Second Area also studied and promoted advanced experiences. The coal cutting efficiency in January increased by 50% compared with the past. All these facts show that as long as the Party issues a call to the workers, points out the direction, and mobilizes the masses of workers, an unparalleled force will appear in production, promoting the leap forward in production. Due to the formation of a new upsurge in production, the leading cadres have been greatly educated, and they have overcome conservative ideas and fear of difficulties, abandoning the plan that had been formulated before, which only saw some objective difficulties, and reduced production in 1958 compared with 1957. Instead, they decided that the entire mine should increase production by 8.2% in 1958 compared with 1957, and save 327,000 yuan in costs.

    This plan has been warmly supported by the vast number of employees in the entire mine. We believe that under the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, after the rectification movement, as long as we wholeheartedly rely on the masses of workers, correctly implement Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, learn from various advanced experiences, and constantly oppose conservative ideas, we will definitely be able to overcome various difficulties, over fulfill the increased production plan for 1958, and achieve continuous leap forward in production. We have the confidence and determination to catch up with and surpass Britain in terms of the main industrial products of our country in about fifteen years.

### 洪山煤矿工人准备连续大跃进  崔德锡代表的发言

    洪山煤矿工人准备连续大跃进
    崔德锡代表的发言
    我完全同意彭真副委员长，李先念、薄一波副总理向大会所作的报告，以及吴老对文字改革问题的报告，和代表资格审查的报告，建议大会通过这些文件。
    现在我仅就我所在的洪山煤矿的一些情况向各位代表汇报一下。
    （一）
    事实证明昔不如今
    从前全部是人工劳动生命没有保障
    现在大部机械化已杜绝了死亡现象
    五四采煤队被评为全国先进采煤队
    洪山煤矿原来是一个非常破烂落后的企业，在解放前全部生产过程都是依靠人工劳动，生产能力很低，安全设施很差，工人的生命没有保障，最高纪录的年份，平均每天要死一个工人，工人的生活条件和工作条件是不堪设想的。
    解放后，由于我们是工人阶级领导的国家，减轻工人的劳动强度，安全生产一直被看成是重要的问题，几年来国家不断的投资，矿上各种繁重的体力劳动，到一九五七年末，百分之九十左右用机械代替了，因此使生产水平大大提高，一九五七年的产量比一九五三年增长近百分之三十。矿上增加了许多安全设施，严格推行操作规程和保安规程的结果，使伤亡率逐渐下降，到一九五七年已经杜绝了死亡现象。
    减轻了劳动强度，生命有了保证，这对煤矿工人来说是最重要没有的了，在过去是根本不敢想像的。由于国家对工人的关怀，历次政治运动对工人的教育，特别是一九五六年社会主义改造高潮的胜利，大大的提高了全体职工的社会主义思想觉悟，加之一九五七年开展的全民整风运动，更加鼓舞了职工们建设社会主义的决心，生产热情空前高涨。第一个五年计划的任务，提前九十六天完成了，为国家增产煤炭十九万二千三百多吨。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我们矿上出现了许多先进的事例，例如五四采煤队，就被评为了全国煤矿的先进采煤队。五四队在第一个五年计划中共完成了二千三百三十个循环，回采进度达到了四千二百二十一点三公尺，产煤六十五万四千六百二十八吨，比国家计划超产四万二千一百一十九吨，提前五个月零七天完成了第一个五年计划。一九五七年回采效率比一九五三年提高了百分之七十四点六，坑木消耗量降低了百分之四十九，并且消灭了死亡和重大生产事故，涌现出若干先进小组。按照一九五七年的生产水平，工作面效率在年末已达到七吨左右，十二个月平均为五点八零七吨。洪山是一个八十公分至一百公分的薄煤层区，在这样条件下国内一般的效率大约在四吨左右，五四队不仅超过了这个水平，而且已经超过了英国一九五五年的采煤进度和机械化场子的效率五点七八吨的水平。
    五四队工作面效率高的主要原因是什么呢？他们在工人和技术人员的不断努力下，大致摸索到了这样两点：第一，大力贯彻了正规循环作业，使井下的截煤，支柱，落桩，移溜子，撤柱，放顶等工序能够有机的结合，科学的衔接。为实现这个要求抓住了这样几项措施：（1）提高采煤机械的利用率，做到快速截煤，快速移溜子，保证溜子移的直、平、稳，这样做的结果使洪山的采煤机械利用率达到了百分之六十九，超过了全国一般只利用到百分之四十八点七的水平。（2）保证及时供应车皮，做到及时把采出来的煤提升上去，为此运修区、采煤区都订了车皮供应合同。（3）为了保证正规循环，充分发挥劳动力的效率，我们组织了预备队，在各固定采煤小组遇到地质变化，出勤不足的时候，就从预备队中调出人力补充，在各固定采煤小组因某些原因有多余劳动力时，就投入预备队的非正规面生产，这样既保证了正规循环，又避免了窝工。（4）不断的加强正规循环作业的教育，这种思想巩固了，保证正规循环的决心也就大了，因此常常在眼看循环可能遭到破坏的情况下，工人都千方百计地设法克服困难，争取了正规循环，这就保证了采煤效率。第二，是在队里开展劳动竞赛，推广各种先进经验。运动搞好了，正规循环就更有了保证，就能多出煤。
    （二）
    五四采煤队新倡议
    开展“万吨掌子满循环”的竞赛
    推动全矿进入生产高潮突破定额
    领导干部克服保守思想改订计划
    上述成绩，并没有使我们感到满足，我们知道我国煤炭工业生产还远不能适应日益发展的工农业生产需要和全国人民的生活必需。特别从毛主席提出在今后十五年或者稍多一点的时间内使我国在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的伟大号召后，更使我们感到责任重大，因为不论炼钢、发电、交通运输，任何工业都离不开煤炭，煤炭是工业的食粮，所以我们全矿的工人也就更加鼓起了革命的干劲来迎接第二个五年计划。
    为了深入贯彻多、快、好、省的勤俭建国的方针，五四采煤队向全矿和全省的煤矿工人提出了开展“万吨掌子，满循环”竞赛的倡议。他们提出的一九五八年指标是：
    1、全年产煤十二万三千二百五十五吨，比一九五七年的生产水平递增百分之十九点八，达到月产万吨掌子的水平；回采效率五点八吨，比国家计划提高百分之六点一七。
    2、全年三百五十一个工作日，完成三百三十九个循环，进度六百七十八公尺。
    3、提高煤的质量，含矸率比国家计划规定降低百分之零点五。
    4、降低成本，节约坑木一百二十立方公尺；吨耗达到零点零零九四三立方公尺。
    5、确保安全生产、消灭重大人身事故和生产事故。
    在五四队的推动下，全矿在十二月份就有百分之七十以上的小组都制订了保证计划（现在肯定超过了这个数字），去年十二月份在制订计划的小组中有百分之九十六都突破了定额。如一立井掘进区，十二月份进度比计划超过一百五十七公尺，比增产计划还超过五十五公尺、节约坑木二十九立方，生产效率比计划提高了百分之十八，创造了本区全年最高生产月。又如一井掘进二组，为了解决长期存在着的掘进落后于回采的问题，研究学习了先进经验，使掘进效率大大提高，十二月份已达到定额的百分之一百六十五。五二区截煤机小组也研究推广了先进经验。一月份截煤效率比过去提高了百分之五十。这一些事实都说明了：只要党向工人发出号召，指引出方向，发动起工人群众，生产上就会出现一种无比的力量，促进生产的跃进。由于新的生产高潮的形成，大大的教育了领导干部，克服了保守思想和畏难情绪，抛弃了在这以前因为只看到一些客观困难，所制订出来的一九五八年比一九五七年还要减产的计划。而决定在一九五八年全矿要比一九五七年增产百分之八点二，成本节约三十二万七千元。
    这个计划已受到全矿广大职工热烈的拥护。我们相信：在党中央和毛主席的号召下，经过整风运动，只要我们全心全意依靠工人群众，正确贯彻毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的指示，学习各种先进经验，不断的反对保守思想，就一定能够克服各种困难，超额完成一九五八年的增产计划，取得生产上的连续跃进。我们有信心、有决心经过十五年左右使我国的主要工业产品赶上和超过英国。
