To Increase Production, We Need Technology; To Acquire Technology, We Need Culture
Privately Run Schools Spring Up Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain
Diligently and Frugally, Students Study and Farm Simultaneously. Teaching Content Integrated with Production

　　This newspaper reports that the development of agricultural production has promoted the development of rural education. Under the slogan "Increased production is the focus, technology is the most important, and a lack of education is unacceptable," farmers across the country actively established their own schools in 1957. According to statistics from fifteen provinces and cities, there are more than 25,600 elementary schools run by the masses, with more than 1,610,000 students. Incompletely statistics from eighteen provinces and cities show that there are approximately 8,000 middle school classes run by the masses, with more than 426,000 students. In Guizhou Province, nearly 500,000 students attend elementary schools run by the masses, accounting for 30.5% of the total number of elementary school students. In Hubei Province, the number of students in elementary schools run by the masses reached more than 540,000, accounting for more than 17% of the total number of elementary school students. In Gansu Province, there are now more than 4,900 elementary schools run by the masses, with an average of nearly two such schools in each township (镇). In Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, fourteen counties established 370 privately run middle schools last year, with 420 classes and more than 26,000 students. Gutian County in Fujian Province is a mountainous area, and the masses have always been very enthusiastic about running schools. In 1951, students in schools run by the masses accounted for 15.4% of the total number of elementary school students in the county. During the upsurge of cooperativization, the number of students increased to more than 6,900, accounting for 31.7% of the total number of elementary school students in the county. Yihuang County in Jiangxi Province is a high mountain and cold water area. Before liberation, the culture was backward, and several villages could not find a literate person. Now, more than 85% of the natural villages in the county have public and privately run elementary schools. In Gansu Province, Wushan County now has schools in every commune. There are more than 24,000 students in school, of which 73.7% are educated in elementary schools run by the masses, and the number of students accounts for 95.9% of the county's school-age children. Relying on the strength of the masses, the county has basically solved the problem of popularizing elementary education.
　　Privately run middle schools also developed rapidly in 1957. In Henan Province, there was only one class in a privately run middle school in 1956, with 59 students. By 1957, it had developed into 2,586 classes with more than 140,000 students; Hebei Province established more than 2,000 classes with more than 120,000 students; Liaoning Province also jumped from 35 classes to 1,619 classes with 98,536 students. These facts fully demonstrate that the masses have a high enthusiasm for running schools, and also prove that the masses are indeed capable of running schools.
　　Some of the middle and elementary schools run by the masses in various places are doing very well. A prominent feature is that they attach importance to the combination of school education and productive labor in running schools. The middle school run by the Gouzhao Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, in addition to teaching students cultural and scientific knowledge, teachers and students participate in productive labor every day. The school's curriculum and many specific measures pay attention to the needs of production, and also stipulate field labor courses. The school's expenses, including teachers' salaries, are mostly solved by the income from students' participation in productive labor. In addition to a fixed salary, teachers themselves participate in labor and can earn about 500 work points a year. Students usually participate in work such as cutting grass, feeding livestock, and picking cotton, and participate in wheat harvesting and autumn harvesting during the busy farming season. Calculated together, each person can have 30 to 40 full labor days each year, which is well received by the masses. In Fengrun County, Hebei Province, 64 privately run middle school classes have generally achieved a combination of learning and production, so that students not only learn culture but also learn production skills. The Dalingzi Privately Run Middle School implemented a two-part system, with 259 students participating in half-day labor in the agricultural cooperative. After last autumn, 21 students earned 500 to 1,000 work points, and 174 students earned 100 to 500 work points. Many students have achieved work-study programs and self-sufficiency. Wang Yimin, a second-year student at the school, earned 1,000 work points last year. He said, "If I can go to a higher school after graduation, I will go. If I can't go, I have also learned the skills of farming and can participate in labor very well."
　　The middle and elementary schools run by the masses in various places all pay attention to implementing the policy of running schools diligently and frugally. Some school buildings use public houses, some use ancestral halls and temples, or borrow private houses; some are built by the masses themselves by contributing labor and materials. In the process of preparing for schools, township and commune cadres and farmers have shown moving enthusiasm for running schools, and many problems that were originally considered unsolvable have been solved. Prominently, four farmers in Lingbao County, Henan Province, Lai Shengzhe, Bai Chongyi, Tian Xihong, and Chang Zhenmin, donated 3,600 yuan to build a middle school. When Yangjiagou Village in Wushan County, Gansu Province, was building school buildings, the masses enthusiastically donated materials and built the foundation themselves, burned bricks and tiles, and felled wood. As a result, they only spent two yuan to buy nails and seven yuan to buy hemp stalks to build two classrooms that can accommodate 120 students.
　　Various places also have many good experiences in developing and consolidating schools run by the masses. The experience of Hubei Province is to first obtain the attention of the Party committee, and under the unified leadership of the Party and government, publicize and implement the policy of running schools by the masses. And take measures to convey it to the cadres of districts, townships and communes through the party and government system of the county; convey it to the masses through the people's congresses and representatives at all levels; and convey it to the principals, teachers and parents through the publicity and investigation of the education administrative departments. This method of conveying at all levels and in all aspects makes the policy of running schools by the masses truly known to every household and everyone in some areas. This has reversed the tendency of the masses to think that "running schools is a matter for the public, and we don't care," and strengthened their sense of responsibility for running schools.
　　However, to implement the running of schools by the masses, it is still necessary to solve some ideological obstacles. The most important thing is that some education administrative departments have the idea of ​​being afraid of trouble and afraid of burdens; in some places, the purpose of running schools is not clear enough. These problems need to be solved to make privately run middle and elementary schools develop and consolidate more healthily.

　　要增产就要技术　要技术就要文化
    民办学校如雨后春笋
    克勤克俭边读边耕　教学内容结合生产
    本报讯　农业生产的发展，推动了农村教育事业的发展。农民在“增产是中心，技术最要紧，没文化可不行”的口号下，1957年全国各地群众积极地自己办学校。根据十五个省、市统计，群众自办的小学有二万五千六百多所，学生一百六十一万多人。十八个省、市的不完全统计，群众办的中学约八千个班，学生有四十二万六千多人。贵州省群众自办小学学生近五十万，占小学学生总数的30.5％。湖北省各地群众自办的小学学生数达五十四万余人，占小学生总数的17％强。甘肃省群众办的小学已达四千九百多所，平均每个乡（镇）有近两所群众办的小学。河南省新乡专区十四个县去年群众自办中学即达三百七十处，四百二十班，学生二万六千余名。福建省古田县是一个山区，群众办学的积极性一贯很高，1951年群众自办的学校学生占全县小学生数的15.4％，合作化高潮时，学生人数增至六千九百多人，占全县小学生总数的31.7％。江西省宜黄县是个山高水冷的地区，解放前文化落后，几个村庄找不到一个识字的人，现在全县85％以上的自然村都有了公立和群众自办的小学。甘肃省武山县现在是社社有学校。全县在校学生共二万四千多人，其中在群众自办小学中受教育的占73.7％，学生数占全县学龄儿童95.9％。依靠群众力量，该县已基本上解决了小学教育的普及问题。
    群众自办中学，1957年也发展得很快。河南省1956年只有民办中学一个班，学生五十九人，到1957年已发展为二千五百八十六个班，学生达十四万多人；河北省办了二千多个班，学生十二万多人；辽宁省也从三十五个班，跃增为一千六百一十九班，学生九万八千五百三十六人。这些事实充分证明，群众要求办学的积极性是很高的，同时也证明了群众确实有能力办学。
    各地群众举办的中、小学校，有些是办得很好的。显著的特点，就是在办学中重视学校教育和生产劳动相结合。河南郑州市郊区沟赵农业生产合作社办的中学，除教学生学习文化科学知识外，每天师生都参加生产劳动。学校课程设置和许多具体措施，都注意结合生产需要，还规定了田间劳动课。学校的经费，包括教师的工资，大部分都依靠学生参加生产劳动的工分收入解决。教师除固定的工资外，自己参加劳动，一年大约还可挣五百个工分。学生平日参加割草、喂牲口、摘棉花等工作，农忙时参加麦收、秋收，合算起来，每人每年可有三十到四十个整劳动日，群众反映很好。河北丰润县六十四个民办中学班，一般都作到了学习和生产相结合，使学生既学习了文化，又学会了生产本领。大岭子民办中学实行了二部制，有二百五十九名学生参加农业社的半日劳动。去年秋后，有二十一名学生收入五百到一千工分，有一百七十四名学生收入一百到五百工分。不少学生做到了勤工俭学，自给自足。该校二年级学生王义民去年挣了一千工分，他表示：“毕业后能升学就升学，不能升学我也学会了种地的本领，可以很好地参加劳动”。
    各地群众自办的中、小学，都注意贯彻勤俭办学的方针。校舍有些是利用公房，有些是利用祠堂、庙宇，或借用民房；有些是群众献工献料自己动手修建的。在筹办学校过程中，乡、社干部和农民群众表现了动人的办学热情，许多原来认为不能解决的问题都解决了。突出的如河南灵宝县农民来生哲、白崇义、田希宏、常振民等四人乐捐了三千六百元，办了一座中学。甘肃武山县杨家沟修建校舍时，群众踊跃献料，自己动手打地基，自己烧砖瓦、伐木料，结果只用了两元买钉子，七元买麻杆，修起两个教室，可容纳一百二十名学生上课。
    各地在发展和巩固群众自办学校的工作上，也有许多好经验。湖北省的经验是首先取得党委的重视，在党政统一领导下，宣传贯彻群众办学的方针。并采取通过县的党政系统，贯彻到区、乡、社干部中去；通过各级人民代表会议和代表贯彻到群众中去；通过教育行政部门的宣传、调查，贯彻到校长、教师、家长中去。这种层层贯彻，条条贯彻的作法，使群众办学方针，在某些地区真正做到家喻户晓，人人皆知。这就扭转了群众认为“办学是公家的事，我们不管”的倾向，加强了对办学的责任感。
    但是，要贯彻群众办学，目前还必须解决一些思想障碍。最主要的是有些教育行政部门有怕麻烦、怕背包袱的思想；已办起来的，有些地方对办学的目的性还不够明确。这些问题需要加以解决，使民办中、小学更加健康地发展和巩固。
