Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 15th: Wuhan City Commercial Bureau cadres recently established an experimental store in the downtown area of Hankou as an active measure to eliminate bureaucracy and apathy, and to comprehensively improve working methods.

For the past week, the Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party Branch, Deputy Director, Section Chief, and Deputy Section Chief of the Municipal Commercial Bureau have successively left their offices and taken turns serving as sales clerks, procurement staff, or warehouse keepers in this store, participating in specific labor.

They first tested a scientific management method in this representative store, which is to determine the rational inventory level of various department store items according to their turnover rate, and place a certain number of goods in fixed positions according to categories. This can strengthen the planning of procurement, prevent the backlog of goods, accelerate capital turnover, and facilitate sales clerks in quickly retrieving and handling goods, improving service quality. In order to explore the experience of how commercial departments can promote industrial production, the experimental store broke with convention and changed the established method of displaying goods. It placed various non-branded goods in prominent places in shop windows and counters, and sales clerks also cooperated in introducing the characteristics of these goods, actively creating conditions for production departments to expand reproduction.

The leading cadres of the Commercial Bureau also boldly exercised their spirit of innovation, experimenting with restoring some good historical traditions in operation and breaking some unreasonable commercial practices in the store. They specially set up a service person at the entrance of the experimental store, whose job is to pay attention to attracting pedestrians lingering in front of the shop windows, inviting them to visit the store, then inquiring about their needs, guiding them to the relevant counters to select goods, and trying out a sales method of allowing goods to be exchanged or returned. In the past few days, this service attitude has left a good impression on customers.

In order to study whether it is necessary for department stores in Wuhan to extend night hours, this experimental store conducted an experiment of extending business hours by one hour, which was very popular with customers. That night, the store sold more than 200 yuan worth of goods in one hour, and Wang Shouyi, Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch of the Commercial Bureau, sold more than 20 children's hats himself. Based on the results of the experiment, the Municipal Commercial Bureau decided to extend the night market by one hour for more than 400 state-owned and joint state-private retail stores in the city's department store system from the 14th. How to adopt the mass line method to further improve operation and management is also one of the topics that the Commercial Bureau cadres are experimenting with in this store. The store has convened representatives of street residents from different strata to hold forums and listen to their opinions on the supply of goods. The Municipal Commercial Bureau decided, according to the residents' requirements, to first restore the sales clerk service slogan that was once cancelled in the experimental store - "Never tired of answering questions, never tired of helping select goods" - in order to better serve customers.

    打掉商业工作上的官气暮气
    武汉市建立一个试验商店
    领导干部亲自担任营业员，大胆革新工作
    新华社武汉15日电　武汉市商业局干部最近在汉口市中心区建立了一个试验商店，作为打掉官气暮气，全面改进工作方法的积极措施之一。
    一周来，市商业局中共支部副书记、副局长、科长、副科长都相继走出办公室，轮流到这个商店担任营业员、进货员或保管员，参加具体劳动。
    他们首先在这个具有代表性的商店内试行一种科学的管理办法，即根据各种百货用品的周转速度，分别确定它们的合理库存量，并且把一定数量的商品分门别类地放在固定位置。这样可以加强进货的计划性，防止商品积压，加速资金周转，同时又便于营业员勤取快拿，提高服务质量。为了摸索商业部门如何促进工业生产的经验，试验商店打破陈规，改变了沿袭的商品陈列法，把各种非名牌货放在橱窗、柜台中引人注目的地方，营业员也配合介绍这些商品的特点，积极为生产部门创造扩大再生产的条件。
    商业局的各级领导干部还大胆发挥革新精神，在商店里试行恢复经营上某些优良的历史传统，破除一些不合理的商业惯例。他们在试验商店门口专设了一个服务员，服务员的职务是注意招徕在橱窗面前徘徊的行人，邀请他们进店参观，然后探听他们的需要，指引他们到有关专柜去挑选商品，并且试行商品包调回换的销售办法。几天来，这种服务态度给顾客留下了良好的印象。
    为了研究武汉市的百货商店延长夜市有无必要，这个试验商店曾作了一次延长营业时间一小时的试验，结果很受顾客欢迎。当晚，商店在一小时内销售了二百多元的货物，商业局党支部副书记王守一经手卖出的童帽就有二十多顶。根据试验的结果，市商业局决定从14日起把全市百货系统四百多个国营和公私合营零售商店的夜市延长一个钟点。怎样采用群众路线的办法来进一步改善经营管理，也是商业局干部在这个商店试验的课题之一。商店曾召集不同阶层的街道居民代表举行座谈会，听取他们对物资供应工作的意见。市商业局决定根据居民要求，先在试验商店内恢复一度被取消的营业员服务口号——“百问不厌、百选不烦”，以便更好地为顾客服务。
