    Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai
    Send Congratulations on the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the Soviet Army

    Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council, sent a telegram on the 21st to Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, to congratulate them on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army. The telegram is as follows:

    To Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,
    To Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR,
    To Comrade Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR,

    Dear Comrades!

    On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the heroic Soviet Army, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, I extend warm congratulations to you, and through you, to the great Soviet people.

    The glorious Soviet Army is the first army of the working class and peasants in the world, born in the flames of the great October Socialist Revolution. For forty years, this completely new type of socialist army, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, has experienced a glorious and brilliant fighting path. The heroic Soviet Army once victoriously defended the achievements of the October Revolution and crushed the armed intervention of imperialism; in the Second World War, it eliminated the main forces of the German and Japanese fascist aggressor armies, thereby defending the independence of various countries and saving human civilization. In the post-war period, the Soviet Army has struggled unremittingly to defend world peace and the cause of human progress, and has made extremely outstanding contributions. Facts have proved that the Soviet Army is a loyal friend of all oppressed people and peace-loving people.

    Because the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has continuously strengthened political work in the Soviet Army, and because the Soviet Army has the richest combat experience and the most modern technical equipment, the Soviet Army has become the most powerful and most combat-effective revolutionary army in the world. We believe that in the struggle to defend the security of the socialist camp and to defend world peace, the Soviet Army will continue to achieve new successes.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has learned the basic experience of Soviet army building in long-term revolutionary struggles; in the future, the Soviet Army will still be a model for the Chinese People's Liberation Army to learn from. We are pleased to see that the great unity between the Chinese and Soviet people is developing day by day, and the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Soviet armies is constantly strengthening. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will always stand firmly with the Soviet people and the heroic Soviet Army, and will strive to consolidate the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world.

     Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China
    Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China

    毛泽东主席　刘少奇委员长　周恩来总理
    电贺苏联军队建军四十周年
    新华社22日讯　毛泽东主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理二十一日致电苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫、苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁，祝贺苏联军队建军四十周年。电文如下：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁同志亲爱的同志们！
    欣逢英雄的苏联军队建军四十周年，谨代表全体中国人民，向你们，并通过你们向伟大的苏联人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    光荣的苏联军队是在伟大的十月社会主义革命的烈火中诞生的世界上第一支工人阶级和农民的军队。四十年来，这支完全新型的社会主义军队，在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导之下，经历了光辉灿烂的战斗道路。英勇的苏联军队，曾经胜利地保卫了十月革命的成果，粉碎了帝国主义的武装干涉；在第二次世界大战中，又消灭了德国和日本法西斯侵略军的主力，从而保卫了各国的独立，拯救了人类的文明。战后时期，苏联军队为保卫世界和平和人类的进步事业而奋斗不懈，并作出了极为卓越的贡献。事实证明苏联军队是一切被压迫人民和爱好和平人民的忠实朋友。
    由于苏联共产党在苏联军队中不断地加强政治工作，由于苏联军队拥有最丰富的战斗经验和最现代化的技术装备，苏联军队已成为世界上最强大的最具有战斗威力的革命军队。我们相信，在保卫社会主义阵营各国的安全和保卫世界和平的斗争中，苏联军队定将继续不断地取得新的成就。
    中国人民解放军在中国共产党的领导下，在长期的革命战斗中，学习了苏联建军的基本经验；今后，苏联军队仍然是中国人民解放军学习的榜样。我们高兴地看到，中苏两国人民之间的伟大团结正在日益发展，中苏两国军队之间的战斗友谊正在不断加强。中国人民和中国人民解放军，将永远坚定不移地同苏联人民和英勇的苏联军队在一起，为巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，为维护远东和世界和平而奋斗。
     中华人民共和国主席  中国共产党中央委员会主席  毛泽东
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长　刘少奇
    中华人民共和国国务院总理  周恩来
