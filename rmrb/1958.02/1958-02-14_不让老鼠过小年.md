    Not Letting the Rats Celebrate the Little New Year
    On the 10th, the Heilongjiang Daily published a large-character headline on its front page, reporting the good news that Xiangfang District in Harbin City had become the first basically rat-free area in the province.

    From December 20th of last year, the 180,000 people of Xiangfang District plunged into the struggle to eliminate the four pests. Later, encouraged by the resounding slogan of “Not Letting the Rats Celebrate the Spring Festival” in neighboring districts, some people further proposed the initiative of “Not Letting the Rats Celebrate the Little New Year” (23rd day of the twelfth lunar month) at the end of January. This initiative immediately became the action program for the entire district. After forty-eight days and nights of hard work by the people of the entire district, this goal was finally achieved on February 8th, making Xiangfang District the first basically rat-free area in Heilongjiang Province.

    不让老鼠过小年
    10日黑龙江日报在一版头条用大字标题，报道了该省哈尔滨市香坊区成了全省第一个基本无鼠区的喜讯。
    从去年12月20日起，香坊区十八万人民即投入除四害的斗争。以后，在邻区“不让老鼠过春节”的响亮口号的鼓舞下，1月底有人更进一步提出“不让老鼠过小年”（旧历腊月23）的倡议，这一倡议立即成为全区人民的行动纲领，经全区人民四十八昼夜的苦战，到2月8日，终于实现了这个目标，使香坊区成了黑龙江省第一个基本无鼠区。
