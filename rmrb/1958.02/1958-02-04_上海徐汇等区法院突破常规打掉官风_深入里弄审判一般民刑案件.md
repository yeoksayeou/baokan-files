According to a report in the Liberation Daily: The Xuhui, Luwan, and other district People's Courts in Shanghai, through rectification, have criticized old legal viewpoints, overthrown bureaucratic styles, and are implementing a system of bringing case files into neighborhoods and relying on the masses to handle cases.

After implementing the policy of handling cases by following the mass line, the case handling efficiency of the district courts has significantly improved. The Xuhui District Court, in six days, had five collegiate panels go into neighborhoods eleven times. Due to the assistance of neighborhood mediation committees and the masses, they handled a total of sixty-five cases, with work efficiency doubling compared to the past. One collegiate panel used to handle only twenty-plus cases per month, but now handles twenty cases in six days. The Xincheng District Court once, when adjudicating a housing dispute case, encountered a temporary dispute over the area of the house. The judge immediately went to the scene for an on-site inspection, promptly clarified the doubts, and made a judgment.

The number of cases resolved through mediation has also greatly increased. The Penglai District Court once held a court session in a neighborhood, and out of twenty-two cases, twenty were resolved through mediation, with only two cases not being mediated and being judged on the spot. Many plaintiffs also withdrew their lawsuits on the spot after mediation. In November 1957, the Xincheng District Court received over two hundred cases, and only nine were withdrawn; after going into the neighborhoods and relying on the masses to handle cases in December, the number of withdrawals increased to over fifty out of the two hundred-plus cases received.

In the past, the court's investigation of cases often stopped at the level of neighborhood cadres, but now it has expanded to the residents, leading to a more in-depth understanding and analysis of the cases. According to the experience of the Xuhui, Luwan, Xincheng, and Penglai District People's Courts, bringing case files into neighborhoods and relying on the masses to handle cases has five major benefits: First, backlogs are reduced and case-handling efficiency is improved. The masses reflected that, in the past, it often took several months from filing a lawsuit to a judgment, but now cases can be resolved quickly, and there is no need to appear in court three or two times. Second, it promotes unity among the people. In civil cases, some are extremely minor disputes or disputes over petty matters, such as disputes over a few cents of water and electricity bills, which are also brought to court. Now, with the assistance of residents, appropriate criticism is carried out, and a mediation agreement is reached, or even the lawsuit is withdrawn. Third, conducting investigations and holding court sessions on-site in the neighborhoods of the parties involved helps to clarify the facts of the case and improve the quality of judgments. Fourth, it provides specific guidance and assistance to the mediation committees. After the court goes into the neighborhoods to hold court sessions on-site, from the analysis of the case to the judgment, the mediation committee members participate throughout the process, explaining policies and absorbing their opinions. Therefore, it improves the professional level of the mediation committees, as well as the prestige of the mediation committees. Residents can rely more on the mediation committees to resolve some disputes, without having to sue in court. Fifth, it is conducive to expanding legal education. In the past, there were court schedules posted at the entrance of the court, but few residents came to observe the proceedings. After holding court sessions on-site in the neighborhoods, residents flocked to observe, which was a very vivid legal education for them. Some of the masses reflected that after seeing how the court handled the parties involved, we will not make the same mistakes.

There are still old legal viewpoints of varying degrees among the court staff, who are accustomed to handling cases in isolation. Bringing case files into neighborhoods and relying on the masses to handle cases is a major revolution in thinking. In the beginning, a few judges had some ideological obstacles. Some worried that the cases were not typical enough and would not be very educational for the masses. Some worried that if the parties involved were dissatisfied and appealed, and the higher court overturned the original judgment, they would lose face in front of the masses. Some believed that holding court sessions in the neighborhoods, the "courtroom" was simple and not serious enough. Some worried that holding court sessions in the neighborhoods would require more preparation and procedures, which would reduce work efficiency, etc. In response to these ideological situations, facts were presented, reasons were explained, and debates were conducted. The Xuhui District and other People's Courts, led by their leaders, made typical experiments, proving the superiority of the mass line in practice, and in turn educating the judicial staff. Now, this work style has been gradually promoted.

The court believes that, except for cases involving state secrets and cases that are not suitable for public trial, general civil cases and minor criminal cases can be brought into neighborhoods and regions, relying on the masses to handle cases.

### 上海徐汇等区法院突破常规打掉官风  深入里弄审判一般民刑案件

　　上海徐汇等区法院突破常规打掉官风
    深入里弄审判一般民刑案件
    据解放日报消息：上海徐汇、卢湾等区人民法院通过整风，批判了旧法观点，打倒了官风官气，实行携卷深入里弄，依靠群众办案。
    贯彻了走群众路线办案的方针后，各区法院的办案效率都有显著提高。徐汇区院在六天中，五个合议庭先后下里弄十一次，由于得到里弄调解委员会和群众协助，共处理了六十五件案子，工作效率比过去提高一倍。某合议庭过去每月只能处理二十多件案件，现在六天就处理了二十件。新成区院有次判决一件房屋纠纷的案件，对于房屋面积问题临时发生争执，审判员即就近到现场勘察，及时弄清疑问，作了判决。
    通过调解，成立协议的案件，也大为增加。蓬莱区院有一次下里弄开庭，二十二件案子中，调解成立的占了二十件，只有二件调解未成而当场判决。还有不少原告经调解后当场撤回诉讼。新成区院1957年11月收到的二百多件案子中，撤回的只有九件；12月下里弄依靠群众办案后，收到的二百多件案子中，撤回的增为五十多件。
    法院过去调查案情往往停留在里弄干部一级，现在扩大到居民群众中去了，对于案情的了解和分析更为深入。据徐汇、卢湾、新成、蓬莱等区人民法院的经验证明：携卷入里弄，依靠群众办案有五大好处：一、积案减少，办案效率提高。群众反映说：过去从起诉到判决，往往要拖上好几个月，现在很快就能结案，不必三次、二次到庭了。二、促进了人民内部团结。在民事案件中，有些是极细小的纠纷或意气之争，如为了几角钱水电费的争执，也告到法院。现在经过居民协助，展开适当批评，就达成调解协议，甚至撤销了诉讼。三、由于到当事人的里弄就地调查、开庭，有利于弄清案情，提高判案质量。四、具体指导和帮助了调解委员会。法院下里弄就地开庭后，从案情的分析到判决，自始至终，吸收调解委员参加，阐明政策，并吸取他们的意见。因此，提高了调解委员会的业务水平，也提高了调解委员会的威信，居民有些纠纷更可依靠调解委员会解决，不必诉讼到法院。五、有利于扩大法纪教育。过去法院门口挂有庭期表，但居民来旁听的不多。下里弄就地开庭后，居民纷纷来旁听，这对他们是一次很生动的法纪教育。有些群众反映说：看到了法院对当事人的处理，同样的错误，我们不会再犯了。
    法院工作人员中还存在程度不等的旧法观点，习惯于孤立坐堂办案。携卷下里弄，依靠群众办案，是思想上的大革命。在开始时，少数审判员存在一些思想障碍。有的担心案件不够典型，对群众的教育意义不大。有的担心当事人如不服上诉，上级法院又撤销原判，在群众面前有失面子。有的认为下里弄去开庭，“公堂”简陋，不够严肃。有的顾虑下里弄开庭准备多，手续多，会降低工作效率等。针对这些思想状况，摆事实，讲道理，进行了辩论。徐汇区等人民法院更由领导带头，作出典型试验，从实践中证明了走群众路线的优越性，反过来教育了司法工作人员，现在，这种办案作风已经逐步推广。
    法院认为，除了涉及国家机密和不宜公开审理的案件外，一般民事案件和情节轻微的刑事案件，都可携卷下里弄、下地区，依靠群众办案。
