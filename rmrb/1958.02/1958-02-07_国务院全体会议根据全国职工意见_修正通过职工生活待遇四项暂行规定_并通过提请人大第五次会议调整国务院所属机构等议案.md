Xinhua News Agency, 6th - The State Council held its 70th plenary session this morning.

　　The meeting heard Premier Zhou Enlai's explanation and discussed and approved three proposals from the State Council to the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress: a proposal regarding adjustments to organizations under the State Council; a proposal regarding the appointment and removal of certain members of the State Council; and a proposal to change the directly administered municipality of Tianjin into a municipality under the jurisdiction of Hebei Province.

　　The meeting also approved the chart of adjustments to organizations directly under the State Council and decided to submit it to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review and approval.

　　The meeting heard an explanation from Minister of Labor Ma Wenrui, and discussed and approved the State Council's provisional regulations on the handling of retirement for workers and staff, the State Council's provisional regulations on wage treatment for ordinary workers and general workers in enterprises, institutions, and state organs, the State Council's provisional regulations on the apprenticeship period and living allowances for apprentices in state-owned, joint state-private, cooperative-run, and individually-run enterprises and institutions, and the State Council's provisional regulations on the vacation and wage treatment for workers and staff returning home to visit relatives.

　　After the aforementioned four regulations were approved in principle at the 85th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held on November 16, 1957, the State Council published these regulations on November 20th of last year. Provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities, as well as various departments, followed the State Council's notice and organized workers to conduct extensive discussions in conjunction with the rectification movement. According to reports from twenty-seven provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities, a total of 11,851 key units participated in this discussion, with over 3.1 million workers participating, and a cumulative total of over 168,000 opinions were raised. During the discussions, the vast majority of workers expressed warm support for these four regulations of the State Council, believing that these regulations conform to the principle of overall consideration and appropriate arrangements based on the needs of 600 million people, and conform to the interests of the state and the vital interests of the vast majority of workers. A very small number of workers and young apprentices initially did not clearly understand the significance and certain contents of individual drafts, but after discussion and debate, they eventually improved their understanding. The State Council attached great importance to the opinions of the workers and has revised these four regulations based on the opinions they raised during the discussions.

　　The meeting approved the State Council's provisional regulations (draft) on the handling of resignation for workers and staff. This draft will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review and approval, and then published as a draft for trial implementation.

　　The meeting also approved the State Council's directive on strengthening the management and education of demobilized soldiers.

　　Finally, the meeting approved the organizational regulations (draft) of the People's Congress and People's Committee of the Sandu Shui Autonomous County, the organizational regulations (draft) of the People's Congresses and People's Committees at all levels of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, the organizational regulations (draft) of the People's Congress of the Songtao Miao Autonomous County, and the organizational regulations (draft) of the People's Committee of the Songtao Miao Autonomous County. These drafts will all be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review and decision.

　　The heads of various provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities attending the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress attended this plenary session as observers.

　　国务院全体会议根据全国职工意见
    修正通过职工生活待遇四项暂行规定
    并通过提请人大第五次会议调整国务院所属机构等议案
    新华社6日讯　国务院在6日上午举行了第七十次全体会议。
    会议听了周恩来总理的说明，讨论通过了国务院向第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议提出的三个议案：关于提请调整国务院所属组织机构的议案；关于提请决定任免国务院若干组成人员的议案；关于提请将直辖市天津市改为河北省省辖市的议案。
    会议还通过了国务院直属机构调整的情况表，并决定提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审议批准。
    会议听了劳动部长马文瑞的说明，讨论通过了国务院关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定，国务院关于企业、事业单位和国家机关中普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定，国务院关于国营、公私合营、合作社营、个体经营的企业和事业单位的学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定，国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定。
    上述四个规定在1957年11月16日举行的全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十五次会议上原则批准后，国务院曾在去年11月20日公布了这些规定，各省、自治区、直辖市、各部门都按照国务院的通知，组织职工结合整风运动进行了广泛的讨论。据二十七个省、自治区、直辖市的报告，这次讨论的重点单位共有一万一千八百五十一个，参加讨论的职工有三百一十多万人，讨论中提出的意见累计共有十六万八千多条。广大职工在讨论中表示热烈拥护国务院的这四个规定，认为这些规定符合于从六亿人口出发统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针，符合于国家利益和广大职工的切身利益。很少数的职工和青年学徒起初对于个别草案的意义和某些内容认识不清，但是经过讨论争辩，他们最后也都提高了认识。国务院十分重视职工们的意见，已根据他们在讨论中提出的意见对这四个规定进行了修改。
    会议通过了国务院关于工人、职员退职处理的暂行规定（草案），这个草案在提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审议批准后，将作为草案公布试行。
    会议还通过了国务院关于加强对复员军人管理教育的指示。
