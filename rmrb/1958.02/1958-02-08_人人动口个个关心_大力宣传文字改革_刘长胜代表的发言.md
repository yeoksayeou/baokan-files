I completely agree with the four reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the work of language reform.

Our country has done a great deal of work in language reform, and its development prospects are unlimited. As far as the current main tasks of language reform in our country are concerned, the simplification of Chinese characters has been welcomed by the masses, the popularization of Mandarin is being carried out nationwide, and the draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme has also been promulgated by the State Council. Language reform is a major event in the lives of the Chinese people. Doing this work well is of great significance for quickly getting rid of China's long-term cultural backwardness and accelerating the advancement of socialist cause.

I remember twenty-five years ago, I participated in the promotion of the Latinized New Chinese Characters formulated by comrades such as Qu Qiubai and Wu Yuzhang among the overseas Chinese workers in the Soviet Far East. The vast majority of overseas Chinese workers there were illiterate. They warmly welcomed the new writing system, so at that time, rapid achievements were made in promoting the Latinized New Chinese Characters. At that time, I repeatedly thought that if our Chinese revolution was successful, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and with the support of the people across the country, the promotion of the Latinized New Chinese Characters would rapidly achieve even greater success. The establishment of the People's Republic of China and the unprecedented unification of the country in politics, economy, and culture have provided extremely favorable prerequisites for language reform in our country. In October 1949, shortly after the country was liberated, our central government immediately began research on language reform, which proves that the government attaches great importance to this work. It is especially worth pointing out that the government has adopted a correct policy of being both prudent and active in the work of language reform in our country. Now, the broad masses of people are very enthusiastic about language reform.

Be a Promoter of Language Reform

Therefore, I suggest:

(1) Our National People's Congress should discuss and approve the draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme to meet the urgent needs of the vast working people of our country to rapidly improve their cultural level. Comrade Wu Yuzhang has pointed out in his report that this scheme has many uses, and I completely agree with his view.

(2) We must vigorously carry out publicity work on language reform. This is a new task, and everyone must speak up and care, and mobilize everyone to vigorously publicize it. We must make everyone aware of the great significance of this work and mobilize everyone's strength to do it. There are still many people, especially some who are already literate, who do not understand and value the work of language reform enough, and even have concerns and doubts. I think this work should also be done with revolutionary vigor, just like other work. We should call on everyone to be "promoters" rather than "retarders."

In recent decades, with the development and victory of the Chinese revolution, the great unification of the country, more and more Chinese people are speaking Mandarin, and the relationship between dialects in various regions has become closer. Due to the continuous advancement of the socialist construction cause, the government's efforts to promote Mandarin, the possibility of gradually unifying the Chinese language becomes greater and greater. The Chinese language will certainly be unified.

Combine Experts and the Masses to Do a Good Job in Phonetic Annotation of Chinese Characters

(3) Correctly doing the phonetic annotation of Chinese characters, that is, doing a good job in "pronunciation correction," is very important. The formulation of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme has undergone extensive discussions and in-depth research by many language workers and experts, absorbing various experiences in creating Chinese phonetic alphabet over a long period of time. With this scheme, the phonetic annotation of Chinese characters is more convenient. However, this is a very meticulous and complex task, which is the basic construction work for unifying the language, and it is closely related to men, women, old and young across the country. What we are promoting is Mandarin based on the Beijing pronunciation and the Northern Mandarin, not requiring everyone to speak authentic Beijing dialect. Therefore, when carrying out pronunciation correction work, it is possible and necessary to take care of the common points of languages in various regions.

In this regard, I think we should adopt the method of combining theory with practice, and combining experts with the masses. I think the phonetic annotation of some characters is still worth discussing. For example, the phonetic annotation of the three characters "小孩子" (Xiao hai zi - children) is "Xiao hai zi," and the pronunciation is "孝孩即" (Xiao hai ji), while the pronunciation in Northern Mandarin is "Siao hai z," the pronunciation in Shanghai dialect is "Siao nae," the pronunciation in Sichuan dialect is "Siao Xiai z," and the pronunciation in Cantonese is "Sei lo go." This tells us that "Siao" is similar in dialects in various places, so the phonetic annotation of this character should be "Siao" instead of "Xiao." Also, for example, the phonetic annotation of the two characters "萝卜" (Luo bo - radish) is "Luo bo," but Beijing dialect calls it "Lobo," Shandong dialect calls it "Lo bu" or "Lo bei," Hunan dialect calls it "Lo pu," Cantonese calls it "Lo ba," and Shanghai dialect calls it "Lao bo." This again tells us that the character "萝" (Luo) has commonality in several dialects. I think annotating the pronunciation as "Lo bo" is more appropriate than annotating it as "Luo bo." Writing "u" feels awkward instead. Also, for example, the character "的" (de), the phonetic annotation is written as "de," but usually everyone pronounces it as "di." For example, in a sentence like this: "这笔钱是你得的" (This money is what you got), according to the current phonetic annotation, it must be read as "Nide de," which is not smooth or easy to understand.

These examples I cited may not be appropriate, but my main intention is to emphasize that in pronunciation correction work, experts' research must be combined with the practical use of the masses, and a cautious and multi-faceted approach should be adopted. After the phonetic annotation, it should be taken to the masses for experimentation and discussion to see if the pronunciation of these characters matches the pronunciation habits of the masses. After multiple experiments, it is more reliable to affirm it.

Whether the above opinions are correct or not, please criticize and correct them.

### 人人动口个个关心  大力宣传文字改革  刘长胜代表的发言

　　人人动口个个关心  大力宣传文字改革
    刘长胜代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理，彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的四个报告。现在，我想就文字改革工作发表一些意见。
    我国在文字改革方面进行了巨大的工作，而其发展的前景是不可限量的。就当前我国文字改革的几项主要工作来说，汉字的简化已经受到广大群众的欢迎，推广普通话已在全国进行，汉语拼音方案草案也已经国务院公布。文字改革是中国人民生活中的一件大事，做好这个工作，对于较快地摆脱我国在文化上长期落后的状态和加速社会主义事业的推进具有巨大的意义。
    记得二十五年前，我在苏联远东地区的华侨工人中曾经参加过推广瞿秋白、吴玉章等同志所制订的拉丁化新文字的工作。那里的华侨工人绝大多数都不识字，他们很热烈地欢迎新文字，所以当时在推广拉丁化新文字的工作上迅速取得了成就。当时我曾反复想到，假使我们中国革命得到成功，在中央人民政府领导下，在全国人民支持下，推行拉丁化新文字会迅速得到更大的成就。中华人民共和国的成立和全国在政治、经济、文化上实行了空前的统一，这为我国文字改革提供了十分有利的先决条件。一九四九年十月，在全国刚解放不久，我国中央政府就立即开始文字改革的研究工作，这证明政府对这件工作是十分重视的。尤其值得指出的是政府对我国文字改革的工作采取了既慎重而又积极的正确方针。现在，广大的人民群众对文字改革的积极性是很高的。
    做文字改革的促进派
    因此我建议：
    （一）我们这次全国人民代表大会对汉语拼音方案草案加以讨论后予以批准，以利我国广大劳动人民迅速提高文化水平要求的急需。吴玉章同志在报告中已经指出这个方案的用处很多，我完全同意他的看法。
    （二）我们必须大力进行关于文字改革的宣传工作。这是一件新的工作，必须人人动口、个个关心，发动大家共同来大力宣传。必须使大家都认识到这个工作的重大意义，动员大家的力量来做。现在还有不少的人，尤其是有些已经识了字的人，对文字改革的工作不够了解和重视，甚至还有顾虑和怀疑。我看这个工作也要像搞其他的工作一样，也必须鼓起革命的干劲才行，号召大家来做“促进派”而不要做“促退派”。
    近几十年来，随着中国革命的发展和胜利，全国的大统一，中国人民讲普通话的也愈来愈多，各地区方言之间的关系，更加密切了。由于社会主义建设事业的不断推进，政府对推广普通话的努力和提倡，要使汉语逐步得到统一的可能性，就愈来愈大了。汉语是一定能够统一的。
    专家与群众相结合  做好汉字注音工作
    （三）正确做好汉字的注音也即是做好
  “正音”的工作，是十分重要的。汉语拼音方案草案的制订，经过很多语文工作者和专家们的广泛讨论和深入的研究，吸收了过去长时期中创制汉语拼音字母的各种经验，有了这个方案以后，对于汉字的注音工作是更加方便了。但这是一个十分细致而复杂的工作，是统一语言的基本建设工作，它和全国男女老少都有着密切的关系。我们推行的是以北京语音为标准、以北方普通话为基础的普通话，并非要每一个人都说道地的北京话。因此在进行正音工作的时候，有可能也有必要照顾到各地区语言的共同点。
    在这方面，我想我们应采取理论与实际相结合、专家与群众相结合的办法。我以为有些字的注音还值得商量的。譬如：“小孩子”三个字的注音是Xiao hai zi，发音是“孝孩即”，而北方普通话的发音是Siao hai z，上海话发音是Siao nae，四川话是SiaoXiai z，广东话是Sei lo go。这里告诉我们Siao是各地方言相近的，因此这个字的注音似应为Siao而不是Xiao。又如：“萝卜”两字的注音是Luo bo，但北京话是叫Lobo，山东话叫Lo bu或者Lo bei，湖南话叫Lo pu，广东话叫Lo ba，上海话叫Lao   bo，这里又告诉我们“萝”字在几个方言中是有其共同性的，我想，注Lo bo的音比注Luo bo的音更恰当些，写上u反而感到别扭。又如“的”字，注音上写成de，但平时一般人都发di的音，如像这样一句话：“这笔钱是你得的”，按照现在的注音势必要读为Nide de，这就反而不顺口，也不容易懂了。
    这些例子我举得不一定恰当，但我主要的意思是为着强调在正音工作中，专家的研究必须和群众的实际使用相结合，采取慎重和多方面推敲的方法，注音以后拿到群众中去试验和讨论，听听这些字的发音和群众说话的习惯是不是吻合。经过多次试验以后再加以肯定，这样做就比较可靠了。
    以上意见，是否正确，请批评指正。
