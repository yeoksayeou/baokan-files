Withdraw Foreign Troops, Peaceful Reunification of Korea
International Student Union Supports Just Demands of Korean Students

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 26th: According to a report from Prague by the Korean Central News Agency today, the Secretariat of the International Student Union stated that it fully supports the struggle of Korean students to demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and expressed its willingness to unite with Korean students in this struggle.

In a letter to the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, the Secretariat of the International Student Union expressed deep regret over the actions of the United States and the South Korean authorities in undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement. The letter pointed out that the United States and South Korea's actions of transporting atomic weapons into South Korea, establishing atomic bases in South Korea, and conducting large-scale atomic war exercises near the 38th parallel, are creating the danger of atomic war and are contrary to the urgent demands of Korean students and people. The letter said that peace in the Far East and the world has been endangered. The International Student Union believes that achieving the goals of Korean students will be a major contribution to peace in the Far East and the world.

    撤退外国军队　和平统一朝鲜
    国际学联支持朝鲜学生正当要求
    新华社平壤26日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社今天报道的布拉格消息：国际学生联合会书记处表示，它完全支持朝鲜学生要求一切外国军队撤出朝鲜和和平统一祖国的斗争，并且表示它愿意同朝鲜学生在这个斗争中团结一致。
    国际学生联合会书记处在给朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会的一封信中对美国和南朝鲜当局破坏朝鲜停战协定的行为深表遗憾。这封信指出，美国和南朝鲜把原子武器运进南朝鲜、在南朝鲜建立原子基地、在三八线附近举行大规模原子战争演习，这种行动制造了原子战争的危险，是违背朝鲜学生和人民的迫切要求的。信件说，远东和世界和平已经受到危害。国际学生联合会相信，实现朝鲜学生的目标将是对远东和世界和平的重大贡献。
