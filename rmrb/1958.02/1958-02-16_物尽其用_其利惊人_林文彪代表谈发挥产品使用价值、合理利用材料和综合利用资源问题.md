I fully endorse the reports made to the Congress by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

In order to increase production and practice economy, accumulate funds, and accelerate the construction of our socialist cause, I would like to offer a few suggestions from an engineering and technical perspective regarding "making the most of everything," for the reference of our country's industrial construction. If there are any inappropriate points, I hope the delegates will offer criticism and guidance.

    Fully Exploit the Use Value of Products

Maintain and repair products promptly so they can be used repeatedly. The savings from retreading automobile tires extensively would be astonishing.

We know that some products, when they lose the performance characteristics of new products, are neglected and discarded, to be treated as waste products. If they could be maintained and repaired promptly, they could often be used repeatedly, costing little but greatly increasing their use value. This is what it means to "make the most of everything." I will use the example of increasing the retreading rate of automobile tires to illustrate this point:

Due to the rapid growth of the national economy, automobile transport enterprises are developing rapidly, and the annual consumption of automobile tires is enormous. In recent years, due to the continuous improvement of the quality of new tires and the improvement of usage and maintenance techniques, the service life of automobile tires has been continuously increasing, but there is still great potential to be tapped. In foreign countries, a new tire is retreaded after the tread is worn smooth. The use value of the retreaded tire is no different from that of a new tire, and it can often be retreaded two to four times. In other words, one new tire can be used as three to five tires. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to this work, and there are many republic-level trust organizations across the country with specialized retreading factories serving automobile enterprises. In the United States, the production of retreaded tires is 130% of the production of new tires. This is because the full use of retreaded tires can indeed save a great deal of wealth. Here is a comparison of the consumption quotas of main raw materials for a heavy-duty automobile tire (taking 7.50-20 as an example). (Unit: kilograms)

    Item                       Raw Rubber   Cotton Fiber   Steel Wire   Carbon Black
    7.50-20 New Tire           16         12.5           1.14       4.0
    7.50-20 Retreaded Tire       3.5       Not needed     Not needed   1.4

If our country can make extensive use of retreaded tires every year, the value of the main raw materials saved would be astonishing:

The raw materials saved as shown in the table are only the main ones in large quantities. In addition to this, each tire can save other precious raw materials such as zinc oxide, and the quantity is also very large. Not only that, but the labor cost for new tires is more than ten times that of retreaded tires. Saving raw rubber can also save foreign exchange. The cost of building a factory with an annual output of one million retreaded tires is only one-twentieth to one-thirtieth of that of a new tire factory with the same output. This shows that investment in future industrial development is also beneficial.

Unfortunately, the current annual output of retreaded tires in our country is less than 10% of the output of new tires, and most retreading factories have outdated equipment and produce low-quality products, which need to be managed technically in a unified way across the country. The retreading rate is also related to the quality of new tires, especially the usage and maintenance. If these three aspects are coordinated, the problem of fully utilizing retreaded tires and increasing their use value can be easily solved.

    Rational Use of Raw Materials

Do not use a sledgehammer to crack a nut, nor a nutcracker to drive a pile. If synthetic and artificial fibers are used in tire manufacturing, the service life and retreading rate can be improved.

Appropriate raw materials should be selected according to the physical performance requirements of industrial products. If there is overuse or underuse, it is wasteful and unreasonable, and it is not "making the most of everything." I will use the example of using synthetic and artificial fibers in tires in the rubber industry to illustrate this point:

Most industries require fibers with high strength, heat resistance, and fatigue resistance. In the past, the quantity of domestic cotton fiber was insufficient, and the quality was difficult to meet industrial requirements, so Egyptian cotton was imported, which required the country to spend a lot of foreign exchange. Now, our country's textile industry is developing rapidly, and in the near future, it will be able to gradually produce synthetic and artificial fibers. However, synthetic and artificial fibers are a very young industry in our country, as they are starting from scratch. Therefore, they cannot meet the needs of all parties in a short period of time. How to make more rational and full use of synthetic and artificial fibers is a question worth studying. I believe that synthetic and artificial fibers should be used more in industry and appropriately in civilian use.

Synthetic and artificial fibers are superior to cotton fibers in quality. Taking the use of synthetic and artificial fibers in tires as an example, their strength is more than 57% higher than that of cotton fibers, and the quality is significantly increased. At the same time, they have heat resistance, high pressure resistance, high elasticity, and strong buffering action, which can reduce the early damage and deformation of tires, thereby improving the service life and retreading rate of tires. Comparing the mileage, cotton cord tires generally have a mileage of 30,000 to 40,000 kilometers, while synthetic and artificial silk cord tires can reach 60,000 kilometers or more. Because of their superior quality, two fewer layers of cords are required compared to ordinary cotton cord tires, reducing the quota by 20%. Fewer layers also mean less rubber is used, and the savings value is very large. For example, an annual production of 500,000 7.50-20 tires can save 1,250 tons of fiber and 1,600 tons of raw rubber. If we calculate the increased product service life, we can not only save more cotton fiber for weaving more cloth that the people need, but also save the country's foreign exchange and various raw materials. Furthermore, producing high-quality tires relatively reduces the production quantity, and the country's investment can be more widely used.

    Comprehensively Utilize All Resources

Utilize both the "energy" and the "matter" of objects. Comprehensive utilization of resources can greatly accumulate funds. Close integration of the nitrogen fertilizer industry and the soda ash industry can make multiple uses of one thing.

An object is a unity of "energy" and "matter." Using its "energy" and discarding its "matter," or using its "matter" and discarding its "energy," is wasteful. If both the "energy" and the "matter" are used, it is the comprehensive utilization of materials, achieving "making the most of everything." I will use the mutual connection of raw materials required by the nitrogen fertilizer industry and the soda ash industry as an example to illustrate this point:

The chemical composition of ammonia comes from nitrogen N2 in the air and hydrogen H2 in water. How to remove the oxygen from the air to obtain nitrogen and remove the oxygen from the water to obtain hydrogen? Our country now uses combustion and water gas methods. Therefore, coal is its main raw material. Ammonia plants take large amounts of coal and only use its chemical "energy," while discarding its equivalent "matter" carbon dioxide CO2 as waste gas, letting it escape.

The main raw materials of the soda ash industry are salt NaCl, coal coke C, limestone CaCO3, and the catalyst NH3. The chemical composition of soda ash is NaHCO3. Its sodium Na comes from salt NaCl, the carbonate radical comes from CO2 obtained from burning C and limestone CaCO3, and ammonia water combines with carbon dioxide to form ammonium bicarbonate NH4HCO3.

    NH4OH + CO2 → NH4HCO3

Ammonium bicarbonate combines with sodium chloride to form ammonium chloride and sodium bicarbonate (soda ash).

    NH4HCO3 + NaCl → NaHCO3 + NH4Cl

Limestone is burned into lime and used to treat ammonium chloride NH4Cl, reducing it back to the catalyst NH4OH.

    2NH4Cl + Ca(OH)2 → 2NH4OH + CaCl2

By combining the nitrogen fertilizer industry and the soda ash industry, the functions of comprehensive utilization of raw materials and close connection of projects are clearly seen:

(1) We first dry-distill bituminous coal to extract its light oil and tar as raw materials for the chemical industry, and then use the coke C in the ammonia industry, utilizing its chemical "energy" and turning it into "matter" carbon dioxide CO2. In the ammonia plant, it is waste gas, but in the soda ash plant, it becomes the main raw material for the carbonate radical -CO3 of soda ash, making multiple uses of one thing. This is a good example of comprehensive utilization.

(2) If the nitrogen fertilizer industry and the soda ash industry are jointly operated, the ammonia gas obtained from the nitrogen fertilizer plant can be directly provided to the soda ash plant for use as a catalyst. This is not only beneficial to the soda ash industry, but it can also become a solid compound, ammonium chloride NH4Cl. For the soda ash industry, ammonium chloride is a by-product, while for the nitrogen fertilizer industry, soda ash is its by-product. From the perspective of a joint enterprise, both products are important, and they mutually utilize each other to form low costs. Using this method to turn gaseous ammonia into a solid compound, ammonium chloride NH4Cl, is also a type of fertilizer, and its cost is very cheap.

(3) Jointly operating the nitrogen fertilizer industry and the soda ash industry, using the carbonate tower of the alkali plant to combine the waste gas carbon dioxide CO2 from the nitrogen fertilizer plant with ammonia water NH4OH to form a solid compound ammonium bicarbonate NH4HCO3, is also a good fertilizer.

Guangdong is rich in sugarcane, and its bagasse can be used as raw material for the fiber industry. Guangdong has a large paper mill. Guangdong has abundant and high-quality sand for making glass, and plans to build a factory to produce glass. Guangdong will have the construction of a shale oil plant. These industries all need large amounts of soda ash. Guangdong is now building a nitrogen fertilizer plant, and similar attention should be paid to building a soda ash plant, which is of great significance to the development of Guangdong's industry. The main raw material for soda ash production is salt, and Guangdong has vast salt fields, but current production only uses one-quarter of them. Why not prepare early to produce salt? This can also solve people's livelihood and employment problems.

    Conclusion

If the resources mentioned above can be comprehensively utilized, various raw materials can be rationally used, and the use value of various industrial products can be increased, then the series of problems can be summarized as "making the most of everything." If various industries and enterprises in our country can do this, they can greatly accumulate funds for the country. If we want to "make the most of everything," we must march towards science, thereby improving our country's scientific and technological level. Then, how can our country's socialist construction be slow? It must be fast. Our country has a large population, abundant resources, and the superior system of a socialist society, as well as the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. As we move forward on this broad road of socialism to realize our country's twelve-year science plan, why can't we do it? Why can't we realize "catching up with and surpassing the industrial level of the United Kingdom in fifteen years"? Everyone has confidence that we can definitely do it. (Attached chart)

    物尽其用  其利惊人
    林文彪代表谈发挥产品使用价值、合理利用材料和综合利用资源问题
    我完全拥护李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任向大会所作的报告。
    为了增产节约，积累资金，加速我国社会主义事业的建设，我仅就工程技术方面所看到而能做到的“物尽其用”来提几个建议，以供我国工业建设参考。如有不恰当的地方，希望代表们给我批评和指教。
    充分发挥产品使用价值
    要及时保养，及时检修，使产品多次使用，大量使汽车轮胎翻修，节约的原材料价值惊人。
    我们知道有些产品当它失去新品使用性能时，就被人忽视、抛弃，以致作为废品来处理，倘能及时保养，及时检修，往往获得多次使用，所费无几而能大大地提高其使用价值，这就是“物尽其用”。兹就提高汽车轮胎翻修率为例说明如下：
    由于祖国的国民经济迅速的增长，汽车运输企业飞跃的发展，汽车轮胎的每年消耗量为数至巨。几年来由于新制轮胎质量不断提高，使用和保养技术改进，汽车轮胎在使用寿命方面虽不断在增长，但其中尚有很大的潜在能力可以挖掘。在国外一条新制轮胎在使用至花纹磨平后，尚利用其胎体予以翻新。翻新后的使用价值是与新胎没有区别的，而往往可利用翻新二至四次。也就是说一条新制轮胎，可抵三至五条来使用。在苏联是很重视这项工作的，全国各地有很多的共和国托拉斯组织专门翻修厂为汽车企业服务。美国翻新轮胎产量为新制轮胎百分之一百三十。这是由于充分利用翻修轮胎确能节约大量财富的关系。兹将一条载重汽车用轮胎（以7.50—20来计）所用的主要原材料消耗定额对比一下。（单位：公斤）
    项目               生橡胶  棉纤维    钢丝  炭黑
    7.50—20新制轮胎    16     12.5      1.14    4.0
    7.50—20翻新轮胎    3.5    不需用    不需用  1.4
    如果我国每年能大量利用翻新轮胎，其节约主要原材料价值是惊人的：
    上表所举节约原材料仅指主要而量较大者，除此以外，每条胎尚可节约其他如氧化锌等高贵原材料，这数量亦是很庞大的。不仅如此，新制轮胎所费人工还大于翻新轮胎十倍。节约生橡胶还可以节约外汇，建设一座年产量一百万翻新轮胎的工厂所需费用仅及同样产量新轮胎厂的二十分之一至三十分之一，这说明对今后工业发展的投资亦是有利的。
    可惜得很，目前我国的翻新轮胎年产量还不到新轮胎产量的百分之十，且翻胎厂大都设备陈旧，产品质量低劣，尚有待于全国统一技术管理。翻新率还关系新轮胎的质量，尤其是使用保养情况，三方面配合起来，充分利用翻新轮胎问题，提高其使用价值，自然就可迎刃而解了。
    合理使用原材料
    不大才小用，也不小才大用；轮胎制造如果采用合成纤维和人造纤维，就可以提高使用的寿命和翻修率。
    根据工业产品物理性能的要求来采用适当的原材料，如有大才小用，小才大用，都是浪费与不合理，就不是“物尽其用”。兹就橡胶工业中轮胎采用合成纤维与人造纤维为例，说明如下：
    多数工业所需用的纤维要求其质量具有高强力，耐热，耐疲劳等性能。过去国产棉纤维数量不足，质量亦难符合工业上要求，一向是从进口埃及棉来解决，因此国家必须消耗大量外汇。现在我国纺织工业飞跃发展，在不久的将来，就可以逐步生产合成纤维和人造纤维。然而合成纤维和人造纤维在我国是从无到有，还是一个很年轻的工业，因此在很短时期内还不能满足各方面的需要。以致如何更合理地充分利用合成纤维和人造纤维，却是值得研究的问题。我认为合成纤维和人造纤维使用在工业上多一些，适当的给民用为适宜。
    合成纤维和人造纤维其质量比棉纤维为优越。就轮胎采用合成纤维和人造纤维来讲，其强力比棉纤维就提高到百分之五十七以上，质量显著增高，同时具有耐热、耐高压、高弹性与急烈的缓冲作用，轮胎则可减少早期破损与变形的现象，因此就能提高轮胎使用寿命和翻修率。从行驶里程作对比，棉帘线轮胎一般为三至四万公里，而合成丝和人造丝帘线轮胎则可达六万公里以上。因为它的质量优越，比一般棉帘线轮胎可减少两层线，合定额少百分之二十，层数少，使用胶料也少，其节约价值是很大的，如年产五十万条7.50—20轮胎可节约纤维一千二百五十吨，生胶一千六百吨。如果再将其产品使用寿命的提高部分来计算在一起，则不仅节约更多的棉纤维来纺织人民所需要的更多的布，又能节约国家外汇及其各种原材料，并且生产出的质量高的轮胎就相对地减少生产数量，对国家的投资更可以得到广泛的利用。
    综合利用一切资源
    既利用物体的“能”，又利用物体的“质”，综合利用资源，就能大大积累资金，氮肥工业和纯碱工业密切联系起来，可以使一物多用。
    一个物体是以“能”与“质”而成为一体，用其“能”而丢掉其“质”，或用其“质”而舍去其“能”，都是浪费；如能既用其“能”又用其“质”，就是物资的综合利用，达到其“物尽其用”。试举氮肥工业与纯碱工业所需用原材料的互相联系为例说明如下：
    氨的化学成分来自空气之氮N2与水之氢H2。如何提掉空气的氧而得氮与提掉水的氧而得氢，我国现在采用燃烧与水煤气的方法。所以，煤是其主要原料。氨厂拿大量的煤仅用其化学“能”，而将其等量的“质”二氧化炭CO2作为废气任其飞逸。
    纯碱工业主要原料是盐NaCl，煤焦C，石灰石CaCO3及促媒剂NH3。纯碱的化学成分NaHCO3，其钠Na来自盐NaCl，炭酸根来自炭C与石灰石CaCO3所烧得的CO2，氨水与二氧化炭化合为炭酸氢氨NH4HCO3。
    NH4OH＋CO2→NH4HCO3
    炭酸氢氨与氯化钠化合成为氯化氨与炭酸氢钠（纯碱）
    NH4HCO3＋NaCl→NaHCO3＋NH4Cl
    石灰石烧成石灰，用作处理氯化氨NH4Cl，使其还原为促媒剂NH4OH。
    2NH4Cl＋Ca（OH）2→2NH4OH＋CaCl2
    把氮肥工业与纯碱工业结合起来，很显明地看到原材料的综合利用与工程的密切联系的功用：
    （1）我们先把烟煤干蒸馏，提取其轻质油与焦油作为化学工业的原料，才把焦炭C在氨工业利用其本身的化学“能”后，变为“质”二氧化炭CO2，在氨厂作为废气而在纯碱厂成为纯碱的炭酸根—C03的主要原料，一物多用，这是一个很好综合利用的例子。
    （2）如氮肥工业与纯碱工业联合运用，即将氮肥厂所得气体的氨直接提供纯碱厂作为促媒剂之用，既对纯碱工业有利，又能将其本身成为固体化合物氯化氨NH4Cl。对纯碱工业来讲，氯化氨是一个副产品，而对氮肥工业来讲，纯碱是它的副产品；从联合企业来讲，两个产品都是重要的，彼此互相利用构成低廉成本。气体氨用这个方法变成固体化合物氯化氨NH4Cl也是一种肥田料，其成本是很便宜的。
    （3）联合运用氮肥工业与纯碱工业，利用碱厂的炭酸塔将氮肥厂的废气二氧化炭CO2与氨水NH4OH结合成为固体化合物炭酸氨NH4HCO3，也是一个很好的肥田料。
    广东盛产甘蔗，其蔗渣可作纤维工业的原料。广东有很大的制纸厂。广东有丰富与质量好的制玻璃的沙子，拟建厂生产玻璃。广东将有岩页油厂的建设。这些工业都需用大量纯碱。广东现在兴建一个氮肥厂，似应予以同样重视来筹建一个碱厂，对广东工业的发展是有很大的意义。制碱的主要原料是盐，广东有广阔的盐田，现在生产仅用了四分之一，为什么不早作准备来生产盐呢？这也可解决人民生活与就业问题。
    结语
    上面所说的资源能够得到综合利用，各种原材料能够得到合理使用，以及各种工业产品能够提高使用价值，就一系列的问题，总的来看，就是“物尽其用”。我国各种工业、各个企业之间都能这样做到的话，就能给国家大大地积累资金。要是做到“物尽其用”，就必须向科学进军，从而能提高我国科学技术水平，那么我国社会主义建设那里能够慢呢？当然一定能快的。我国人口众多，资源丰富，而且有社会主义社会的优越体制，有共产党与毛主席的英明领导，我们在这条社会主义康庄大道上前进，来实现我国十二年科学规划，为什么不可以呢？在“十五年赶上和超过英国工业水平”又为什么不可实现呢？大家都有信心，我们完全能够做到的。（附图表）
