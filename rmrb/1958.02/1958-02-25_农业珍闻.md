Agricultural Oddities

    Bean Trees
    At the 7th Agricultural Exhibition in Guizhou Province, visitors witnessed beans growing on trees in Panlong Township, Zhenfeng County, Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. The exhibited bean tree was over ten feet tall, with leaves similar to ordinary bean leaves. This bean tree yields about ten *jin* (approximately 5 kg) of beans per year, while ordinary soybeans yield only about three *liang* (approximately 150 grams) per plant. This bean tree is a wild plant and can be harvested twice a year. The beans can be used to make tofu or other foods.

    93-Jin Pumpkin
    Wang Fujun, director of the Anli Agricultural Cooperative in Shijiawanzi Township, Zhengning County, Gansu Province, recently entrusted someone to send a 93-*jin* (46.5 kg) pumpkin that he had grown to the capital, as a gift to our beloved leader Chairman Mao. Wang Fujun cultivated six large pumpkins on two vines last year, weighing a total of 243 *jin* (121.5 kg). The largest weighed 93 *jin* (46.5 kg) (generally 50-60 *jin*). Wang Fujun is therefore known as the "Pumpkin King."

    156-Jin Sweet Potato from One Plant
    Huang Zhaoquan, a young member of the Central Agricultural Cooperative in Tangxia Township, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, and a graduate of elementary school, cultivated a sweet potato plant using the moonflower grafting method, which yielded 156 *jin* (78 kg). This yield is twenty-four *jin* and six *liang* (12.3 kg) heavier than the sweet potato plant cultivated by Zhu Zhuang, a young member of the Chajiang Agricultural Cooperative in Heng County, Guangxi Province, using the moonflower grafting method, which recently set a national high-yield record. This sweet potato plant is already on display at the Xinhui County Agricultural Exhibition.

    豆子树
    在贵州省第七届农业展览会上，观众们亲眼看到黔南布依族苗族自治州贞丰县盘龙乡的豆子结在树上。展览的这株豆子树有一丈多高，叶子和普通豆叶相似。这株豆子树年产量达十市斤左右，而一般黄豆，每株不过结豆子三两。这种豆子树是野生植物，一年可收获两次。豆子可做豆腐或其他食品。
    93斤重的南瓜
    甘肃正宁县石家湾子乡安里农业社主任王富均，不久前把他抚育的一个九十三斤重的大南瓜，托人送往首都，赠给敬爱的领袖毛主席。王富均去年培植的两个南瓜蔓上结上了六个大南瓜，共重二百四十三斤，最大的一个九十三斤重（一般五十——六十斤）。王富均因此被称为“南瓜王”。
    一蔸甘薯产156斤
    广东新会县棠下乡中心农业社高小毕业生青年社员黄兆权，用月光花嫁接方法栽培的一蔸甘薯，产量达到了一百五十六斤。这个产量比不久前创全国最高丰产纪录的广西省横县槎江农业社青年社员朱庄，用月光花嫁接方法栽培的一蔸甘薯还重二十四斤六两。这蔸甘薯已在新会县农业展览会上展出。
