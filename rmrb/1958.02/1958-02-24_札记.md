	Notes
	Inopportune

	The U.S. government issued a report on the 17th stating that it owns 772 million acres of land worldwide, a figure equal to 40% of the area of the United States, of which more than 360 million acres are distributed in 109 countries outside the United States. The U.S. government has become one of the world's largest landowners due to its large number of military bases at home and abroad.

	The U.S. government's release of such a report is probably intended to show off its assets and is also part of its "deterrence" policy. But what other purpose can such boasting serve besides nakedly exposing the crimes of U.S. imperialism's military expansion? Moreover, the U.S. government's release of such a report at this time is particularly inopportune, as it can only further escalate the vigorously developing movement of people in various countries demanding that "Yankees go home."

	Drug Taking Effect

	The sharp decline in the U.S. economy and the rapid increase in unemployment have already caused widespread panic in the United States. However, U.S. Vice President Nixon said very lightly on the 14th: "The country's economy is not sick; a dose of confidence medicine can cure it." He also patted his chest and said: "The government will not allow the depression to continue, nor will it allow the number of unemployed to increase."

	But in the week following Nixon's speech, according to the "New York Times," the number of unemployed in the United States increased by another 425,300. Perhaps this is Nixon's "medicine" beginning to take effect.

	Major General Ah Q

	The repeated failures of the U.S. "Atlas" intercontinental missile and "Vanguard" rocket have caused the United States to lose face in front of the world's people. Washington's military and political leaders have tried all kinds of ways to save face, but none have succeeded. The other day, Major General Donald Yates, head of the Cape Canaveral test center in Florida, came up with a clever way to make fun of himself. He publicly declared that the rockets' failure to take off or exploding in mid-air during testing was "not a failure, but a kind of progress."

	This argument is indeed unique. People can't help but think of the joke that satirizes a person who loses at chess. Someone asked him how he fared in the three games he played. He replied leisurely: "I didn't win the first game, the other side didn't lose the second game, and I wanted to draw the third game but the other side wouldn't agree." But that clumsy chess player's skin is thinner than Major General Yates's, because although he does not admit defeat, he does not dare to say that it is a great progress.

    札记
    不合时宜
    美国政府17日发表的报告说，它在全世界拥有七亿七千二百万英亩的土地，这个数字等于美国领土面积的40％，其中三亿六千多万英亩分布在美国以外的一百零九个国家中。美国政府由于在国内外拥有大量的军事基地而成为世界上最大的地产所有主之一。
    美国政府发表这样一个报告，大概是要炫耀一下自己的家当，也属于“威慑”政策的一部分吧。但是这种夸耀除了赤裸裸地暴露美国帝国主义的军事扩张罪恶之外，还能有什么别的作用呢？而且美国政府在这个时候发表这样一个报告是特别不合时宜的，它只能使得正在蓬勃发展的各国人民要求“美国佬滚回去”的运动更加高涨起来。
    药性发作
    美国经济的急剧衰退和失业人数迅速增加，已经在美国国内引起了普遍的惊恐。可是，美国副总统尼克松14日却非常轻松地说：“国家的经济并没有出毛病，一服信心良药就可以治愈。”他还拍胸脯说：“政府将不会听任萧条继续下去，也不会听任失业人数增加。”
    但是就在尼克松讲话之后的一个星期中，据“纽约时报”报道，美国的失业人数又增加了四十二万五千三百人。恐怕这是尼克松的“良药”开始见效了吧。
    阿Q少将
    美国的“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹和“先锋号”火箭屡试屡败，使得美国在世界人民面前丢尽了丑。华盛顿的军政领袖曾想尽各种各样的法子来挽回面子，都并没有成功。前两天，佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角试验中心的负责人唐纳德·耶兹少将却想出了一种自我解嘲的妙法。他公开宣称，这些火箭在试验中不能起飞或者中途爆炸等等都“不是失败，而是一种进展”。
    这种论调确实别开生面。人们不禁想起那讽刺一个输了棋的人的笑话。别人问他对奕三盘胜负如何？他悠然自得地回答：“第一盘我没有赢，第二盘对方没有输，第三盘我要和对方不肯。”但是那位蹩脚棋手的脸皮比起耶兹少将来还要薄一些，因为他虽然不承认失败，但是还未敢说是大有进展哩。
