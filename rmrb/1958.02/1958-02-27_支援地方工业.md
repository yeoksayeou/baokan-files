    Supporting Local Industry
    Wu Lü
    Local industries are experiencing a great leap forward, and all places proposing a leap forward are ashamed to speak of difficulties. Capital relies on local accumulation; raw materials are obtained locally; equipment is simple and makeshift; technology is acquired through short-term training; sales are directed towards rural areas... All difficulties crumble before revolutionary drive.
    However, everyone knows that being ashamed to speak of difficulties does not mean there are no difficulties; having revolutionary drive to overcome all difficulties does not mean that the great leap forward of local industry is an easy task. Aside from other things, the widespread blooming of local industries, the lack of technical equipment, and the shortage of technical personnel are significant problems. It is entirely correct for localities to criticize dependence and fear of difficulties, and to advocate self-reliance. Without this spirit, it would be impossible to organize the great leap forward of local industry. However, on the other hand, supporting local industry and doing everything possible to help localities solve the various difficulties in developing industry is also an unavoidable responsibility. Without this support, the great leap forward of local industry will be more difficult, and the speed of the leap forward may be slower.
    Who should bear the responsibility of supporting local industry? Without a doubt, it should be borne by large cities and state-owned industries. The construction of large cities and state-owned industries once received multi-faceted support from local industries. Many building materials were supplied by local industries, many workers were supported by local industries, and many collaborative parts are still produced by local industries. "Everyone for me, me for everyone," when the great leap forward of local industry is in need of support, how can large cities and state-owned industries stand idly by? Moreover, drawing a few technicians or transferring a few pieces of mechanical equipment from large cities and state-owned industries is like "a drop in the bucket," it's nothing; for local industries, especially county-run industries, one more technician and one more piece of equipment can solve a big problem. What reason do large cities and state-owned industries have to be stingy with this drop in the bucket!
    Chongqing's support for the development of local industry in the Zunyi area is entirely correct. This potential to support local industry exists in any city and any state-owned enterprise. If these forces are all organized, local industry will surely leap forward faster. As a result, it will not only develop local industry, thereby supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production, but also, if in five or seven years, the output value of local industry in each province and region exceeds the output value of agriculture, a completely new situation will emerge in our country's construction. At that time, our country's industry will not be a few scattered "threads," but an entire "fabric" spread across the country; at that time, local industry will have the power to supply a considerable portion of the means of production and means of subsistence, and the state will be able to concentrate its efforts on key construction, and our competition with capitalist countries will be a great victory.
    Large city state-owned industries, reach out and support local industry!

    支援地方工业
    吴滤
    地方工业正在大跃进，而且所有提出跃进的地方都耻言困难。资金，靠地方积累；原料，就地取材；设备、因陋就简；技术，短期培训；销路，面向农村……一切困难在革命干劲的面前一一瓦解。
    然而，谁也知道：耻言困难并不等于没有困难；有了革命干劲可以克服一切困难，并不等于地方工业的大跃进就是件轻而易举的事。别的不说，地方工业普遍开花，技术装备缺乏、技术力量不足，就是个很大的问题。地方上批判依赖思想、畏难情绪，力主自力更生，这是完全正确的。没有这种精神，就无法组织地方工业的大跃进。可是，从另一方面说，支援地方工业，尽一切可能帮助地方上解决发展工业中的各种困难，也是义不容辞的。没有这种支援，地方工业的大跃进要更困难些，跃进的速度也可能会慢些。
    支援地方工业的责任应该由谁担负起来呢？毫无疑问，应该由大城市、国营工业担负起来。大城市和国营工业的建设，曾经得到地方工业多方面的支援。许多建筑材料是地方工业供给的，许多工人是地方工业支援的，许多协作件至今还是地方工业生产的。“人人为我，我为人人”，当地方工业的大跃进正需要支援的时候，大城市和国营工业怎能袖手旁观？而且，从大城市和国营工业抽几名技术人员、调几台机械设备，犹如“九牛一毛”，算不了什么；对地方工业、特别是对县营工业说来，多一个技术人员，多一台设备，就能解决很大的问题。大城市和国营工业有什么理由吝啬这九牛之一毛呢！
    重庆市支援遵义地区发展地方工业是完全正确的。这种支援地方工业的潜力，在任何城市，任何国营企业都是存在的。倘若把这些力量都组织起来，地方工业必能更快地跃进。其结果，不只是发展了地方工业，从而支援了农业生产的大跃进，而且如果五年、七年，各省、区地方工业的产值都超过了农业的产值，我国的建设事业就会出现一个全新的局面。到那时候，我国的工业就不是星星点点的几根“经”，而是遍布全国的整幅的“布”；那时候，地方工业既有力量供给相当部分的生产资料和生活资料，国家就更可以集中力量进行重点建设，我们同资本主义国家的竞赛必能大获全胜。
    大城市国营工业，伸出手来支援地方工业吧！
