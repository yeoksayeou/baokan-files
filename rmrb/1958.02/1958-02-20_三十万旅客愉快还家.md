Three Hundred Thousand Passengers Happily Return Home

    (Our dispatch) The Beijing Train Section's entire staff of over 1,700 employees did not go home for the Spring Festival. They safely transported 171 trains of passengers, enabling approximately 300,000 people to happily and promptly return home to celebrate the Spring Festival.

    Many teams completed their tasks exceptionally well this Spring Festival. The Beijing-Lanzhou Third Package Crew and the Eighth Package Crew each received 150 commendations from passengers on a single trip. The Yan Changqi Team on the temporary train from Beijing to Shanghai proactively and warmly took care of passengers. Some passengers praised them, saying, "Spending the Spring Festival on the train is just like being at home." Various sections also took turns on duty on New Year's Eve and the first day of the New Year, and started working from the second day of the New Year. (Su Fujun)

    三十万旅客愉快还家
    本报讯　北京列车段全段一千七百多名职工春节不回家，安全地运送了一百七十一列车旅客，使大约三十万人愉快而及时地回家欢度春节。
    许多小组今年春节完成任务特别出色。北京——兰州第三包乘组和第八包乘组行驶一趟就分别得到旅客一百五十次表扬。从北京开往上海的临时列车上的阎长岐小组，主动热情地照顾旅客，有的旅客称赞说：“在列车上过春节，就像在家里一样。”各股室也在除夕和初一轮流值班，并从初二就开始办公。　（苏福俊）
