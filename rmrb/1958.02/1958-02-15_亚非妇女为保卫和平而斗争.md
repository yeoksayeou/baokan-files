Asian-African Women Fight to Defend Peace

The Asian-African Women's Conference begins today in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon. This conference was initiated and organized by women's groups from five countries: India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan. It marks a further strengthening of friendly cooperative relations between Asian and African women.

Recently, with the new development of the magnificent mass movement against war and colonialism in the Asian-African region, the Asian-African women's movement, which accounts for half of the seventeen billion people in Asia and Africa, has also experienced tremendous growth.

The voices of Asian-African women for peace are becoming increasingly louder. They urgently demand to defend the happy life of peace and the safety of their children. Therefore, the imperialist war policies promoted in the Asian-African region, especially war activities related to nuclear weapons and atomic bases, have been met with angry condemnation and powerful blows from Asian-African women. The struggle of Japanese women who have suffered greatly has received full sympathy and support from Asian-African women. Japanese women held the Third Mothers' Congress last August. Various Japanese women's organizations also sent representatives to the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Tokyo in the same month. These conferences sent out a resounding call to the world to ban nuclear weapons testing. The All-India Women's Conference held its annual meeting last December, at which a resolution was passed calling for a halt to nuclear explosion tests. Mothers in Ceylon participated in a peaceful demonstration against nuclear weapons testing held last June. A rising tide of representative women's groups and the broad masses of women in various countries are opposing the threat of war.

The areas in which the Asian-African women's peace movement is carried out are becoming increasingly widespread. In the Middle East and Africa, women from Sudan in the south to Syria in the north are angrily denouncing the Eisenhower Doctrine. Women in Iraq and Lebanon have expressed their condemnation of the aggressive Middle East treaty through various means such as rallies, signatures, and protests to parliament. Women working at the Ulangapo American base in the Philippines once wrote letters accusing the US military authorities of various illegal acts. Women working at the Tachikawa US military base in Japan also conducted a long-term strike in March last year. Women in India, Burma, Egypt, Syria, Cambodia, and Sudan wholeheartedly support the neutral policies adopted by their governments. They know that this policy is in the interest of peace and the interest of the vast numbers of women and children.

Another characteristic of the Asian-African women's peace struggle is that it is closely linked with their resolute struggle against colonialism. In most African, Middle Eastern, and some other Asian countries that are striving for independence and freedom, women share a great deal of the struggle's tasks. Many heroines have emerged from the national independence struggles in Algeria, Cyprus, Nigeria, and Madagascar. The struggle of Algerian patriotic heroine Bouhired is a shining example. The French colonial authorities cruelly sentenced her to death, but progressive humanity and hundreds of millions of women around the world sympathize with and support her.

The struggles against colonial rule in which women from India, Indonesia, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Malaya, and other countries have participated have helped to win their countries' independence. Today, they are fighting to continue to consolidate national independence and eliminate the remaining forces of colonialism. Egyptian women once took up arms to defend their motherland or engaged in rescue work during the days of the struggle against Anglo-French aggression. Indian women are resolutely fighting to recover Goa. Indonesian women have also taken active action in the recently launched vigorous struggle to recover West Irian.

Women in China, the Asian republics of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, North Korea, and Vietnam are participating in all aspects of peaceful construction, making outstanding contributions to the great progress of their countries. Women in North Korea and Vietnam also bear the task of promoting the peaceful reunification of their motherlands. The outstanding achievements made by the women of these countries in the cause of national construction are also their achievements in strengthening the cause of world peace.

### 亚非妇女为保卫和平而斗争

    亚非妇女为保卫和平而斗争
    亚非妇女会议从今天起在锡兰首都科伦坡举行。这个会议是由印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、巴基斯坦五国的妇女团体发起组织的。它标志着亚非妇女之间友好合作关系的进一步加强。
    最近以来，随着亚非地区波澜壮阔反对战争、反对殖民主义的群众运动的新的开展，占亚非十七亿人口的半数的亚非妇女运动，也有了巨大的发展。
    亚非妇女的和平呼声日益响亮。她们迫切要求保卫和平的幸福生活，保卫孩子们的安全；因此，帝国主义在亚非地区推行的战争政策，特别是有关核武器和原子基地的战争活动，遭到亚非妇女的愤怒谴责和有力打击。身受其害的日本妇女的斗争，充分得到亚非妇女的同情和支持。日本妇女在去年八月举行了第三届母亲大会。日本各妇女组织还推派代表出席了同月在东京举行的第三届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，这些大会都向世界发出了要求禁止核武器试验的响亮号召。全印度妇女大会在去年12月举行年会，会上通过了要求停止核爆炸试验的决议。锡兰的母亲们参加了去年六月举行的反对核武器试验的和平示威。各国有代表性的妇女团体和广大妇女群众反对战争威胁的浪潮正在高涨。
    亚非妇女和平运动开展的地区愈形广泛。在中近东和非洲，南至苏丹北至叙利亚的妇女都愤怒斥责艾森豪威尔主义，伊拉克、黎巴嫩的妇女用集会、签名、到国会抗议等不同方式表示她们对中东侵略性条约的谴责。在菲律宾乌朗牙坡美国基地工作的妇女们曾经写信控诉美军当局的各种非法行为。在日本立川美军基地工作的妇女去年三月也进行了长期的罢工斗争。印度、缅甸、埃及、叙利亚、柬埔寨和苏丹的妇女，衷心支持本国政府所采取的中立政策。她们知道，这个政策符合和平的利益，符合广大妇女儿童的利益。
    亚非妇女和平斗争的又一特色是和她们坚决反对殖民主义的斗争紧密联系在一起。大部分非洲、中近东和其他一些正在进行争取独立和自由的亚洲国家里，妇女分担了很大的斗争任务。许多女英雄从阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯、尼日利亚、马达加斯加的民族独立斗争中涌现。阿尔及利亚爱国女英雄布伊海德的斗争事迹就是一个光辉的例子。法国殖民当局残酷地判处她死刑，但是全世界进步人类和亿万妇女同情和支持她。
    印度、印度尼西亚、埃及、摩洛哥、突尼斯、马来亚和其他国家的妇女所参加的反殖民统治的斗争，帮助争取了她们国家的独立。今天，她们正在为继续巩固国家的独立，消除殖民主义的残余势力作斗争。埃及妇女曾经在反对英法侵略的斗争日子里纷纷拿起武器保卫祖国，或者从事救护等工作。印度妇女坚决为收回果阿而斗争。印度尼西亚妇女在新近展开的轰轰烈烈的收回西伊里安斗争中也采取了积极的行动。
    中国、苏联亚洲各共和国、蒙古、朝鲜和越南的妇女正在参加各方面的和平建设工作，为她们国家的巨大进步作出卓越的贡献。朝鲜和越南的妇女还负担着促进祖国和平统一的任务。这些国家的妇女群众在祖国建设事业中所取得的优秀成就，同时也就是她们在加强世界和平事业中所取得的成就。
