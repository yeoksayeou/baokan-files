Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot. The call to strive for complete victory in the rectification movement, overcome right-leaning conservative thought, launch a production upsurge, and achieve a great leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production was issued to party organizations across the region by the Second Session of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This meeting was held in Hohhot City from February 6th to 10th, attended by 301 representatives of the 200,000 party members in the region from ethnic groups including Mongolian, Han, Hui, and Daur, with 56 observers.
    Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Strive for Complete Victory in the Rectification Movement, Overcome Right-Leaning Conservative Thought, and Launch an Upsurge in Production and Construction." Yang Zhilin and Wang Duo, Secretaries of the Secretariat, delivered reports respectively on "Outline Recommendations for the Second Five-Year Plan of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the 1958 National Economic Plan" and "Report on the Development Plan for Agriculture and Animal Husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region."
    The meeting reviewed the work of the autonomous region and unanimously agreed that since the First Congress in July 1956, the various tasks in Inner Mongolia have achieved great success in the past year and a half. On the ideological front, after several months of intense anti-rightist struggle and in-depth socialist education, the bourgeois rightists' frantic attacks on the Party and socialism have been crushed. The reactionary arrogance of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in urban and rural areas has also been suppressed, and mutual aid and cooperation organizations in rural areas have been further consolidated. On the economic front, due to strengthened leadership and the implementation of the principles of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and handling all undertakings diligently and thriftily, the First Five-Year Plan and the state's key construction plans in the autonomous region have been completed and overfulfilled, further changing the economic landscape of the autonomous region and laying a good foundation for the construction of the Second Five-Year Plan.
    The meeting believes that the revolutionary heroic spirit of the representatives reflects a new upsurge in the revolutionary enthusiasm of the eight million people in the autonomous region. This revolutionary drive is manifested in the discussion and determination of new, inspiring targets for the great leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production.
    In industry, the meeting determined that the Baotou industrial base should be basically completed during the Second Five-Year Plan. The forest industry should be more than doubled. Various industrial sectors, such as metallurgy, chemicals, machinery, coal, electricity, textiles, and food, must be established. Within ten to fifteen years, the autonomous region should become one of the motherland's heavy industry bases centered on iron and steel, and also become a base for the forest and food industries. The meeting called for vigorous and widespread development of local industries, so that the output value of local industries would increase 3.5 times during the Second Five-Year Plan, catching up with or surpassing the output value of agriculture and animal husbandry. Together with the output value of the industrial and mining enterprises transferred from the central government, the output value of local industries will account for 60%-70% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the autonomous region by 1962.
    In agriculture and animal husbandry, the meeting determined: 1. Grain production: Within eight, seven, or even shorter years, the average grain yield per mu in the region should reach 400 jin, and the four irrigation areas are required to reach the original ten-year plan targets within five years. Completely consolidate the cooperatives and catch up with and surpass the production level and income level of prosperous middle peasants in one to three years. 2. Livestock production: Within ten years, the total number of livestock should reach 50 to 60 million head, increasing by 10% to 12% annually. Realize cooperation in pastoral areas in three years, basically solve the problem of water for humans and animals in five years, and eliminate waterless grasslands. Basically realize settled nomadism within five years. 3. Water conservancy: Complete the original ten-year water conservancy construction targets in five years, increasing the irrigated area of farmland from 8.78 million mu in 1955 to 45 million mu, achieving an average of six mu of irrigated land per person, and basically realizing water conservancy. 4. Soil and water conservation: Complete the original ten-year task in six years, controlling soil and water loss in an area of 100,000 square kilometers. Afforest 4 million hectares and close hillsides for afforestation of 4 million hectares in eight years, and complete the greening task within five years. 5. Eliminate the four pests: Achieve this in cities and towns in two years and in rural areas in four years. Eliminate rats, mosquitoes, flies, and lice in settled areas of pastoral areas in four years, and eliminate wolf damage within five years.
    The meeting pointed out that in order to make a good start for the Second Five-Year Plan, all aspects of production must have a leap forward development this year. The meeting decided that the total grain output this year should reach 10.4 billion jin, the total number of livestock should reach 24.06 million head, the number of live pigs should reach 2.3 million, the total output value of local industries should reach more than 400 million yuan, and the afforestation area should reach 100,000 hectares.
    The meeting believes that to achieve a great leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production, launch a comprehensive upsurge in production and construction, and make socialist construction more, faster, better, and more economical, the key lies in the leadership of the Party. The meeting demanded that political and ideological leadership be strengthened first, resolutely carry out the struggle against right-leaning conservative thought and against waste. Conscientiously implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily. Concentrate all efforts to lead economic work centered on industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production and cultural and educational work, and at the same time strengthen political and legal work to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.
    In order to realize the Party's leadership over the above-mentioned work, the meeting decided that this time, when cadres are transferred to lower levels, a group of cadres at the prefectural committee level and equivalent to the prefectural committee level should be drawn to strengthen the banners and counties; the secretaries of township general branches should generally be filled by the original district committee secretaries, county section chiefs, and county committee members; the weak leadership of industrial and mining enterprises should also be adjusted and strengthened; all middle schools should establish the Party's leadership core, and a group of strong cadres suitable for school work should be transferred to middle schools to serve as principals and Party committee secretaries.
    The meeting also requested party committees at all levels to quickly send capable cadres to collect the grain that should be requisitioned and that must be requisitioned and can be requisitioned.
    The meeting believes that opposing local nationalism is an important aspect of the struggle between the two roads in the autonomous region. In the past year, local nationalism has seen new growth, so the struggle against local nationalism must be carried through to the end. The meeting also emphasized that while opposing local nationalism, the implementation of ethnic policies should be reviewed to oppose Han chauvinism. The meeting passed a resolution to expel Tebuxin, director of the Inner Mongolia People's Publishing House, a bourgeois local nationalist element who undermined national unity and socialist construction, from the Party.
    The meeting fully promoted democracy, implemented the spirit of the rectification movement, and launched ideological debates. During the preparatory meeting, the representatives adopted the forms of "big blooming, big contending, big debate, and big-character posters" to raise many criticisms and suggestions to the Inner Mongolia Party Committee and the leading organs at the autonomous region level. The Inner Mongolia Party Committee and the leading organs at the autonomous region level responded to and handled each of the 2,113 opinions raised by the representatives.

    内蒙古自治区党代会向全区发出战斗号召
    反右倾反浪费　工农牧业齐跃进
    决定把反对地方民族主义的斗争进行到底
    新华社呼和浩特电　争取整风运动全胜，克服右倾保守思想，掀起生产高潮，实现工、农、牧业生产大跃进。这是中共内蒙古自治区第一届代表大会第二次会议向全区党组织提出的战斗号召。这次会议在6日到10日在呼和浩特市召开，出席会议的有代表全区二十万党员的蒙古、汉、回、达呼尔等民族代表三百零一人，列席五十六人。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记乌兰夫在会上作了“争取整风全胜，克服右倾保守思想，掀起生产建设高潮”的报告，书记处书记杨植霖、王铎分别作了“内蒙古自治区第二个五年计划轮廓建议和1958年国民经济计划的报告”、“关于内蒙古自治区农牧业发展规划的报告”。
    这次会议检查了自治区的工作，一致满意的认为，从1956年7月第一次代表大会到现在一年半的时间里，内蒙古各项工作都取得了巨大成就。在思想战线上经过几个月紧张的反右派斗争和深入的社会主义教育运动，资产阶级右派分子向党、向社会主义的猖狂进攻已经被打垮。城乡地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子的反动气焰也被打下去了，农村互助合作组织进一步得到巩固。在经济战线上由于加强了领导，贯彻执行了勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的方针，完成和超额完成了第一个五年计划和国家在自治区的重点建设计划，进一步改变了自治区的经济面貌，为第二个五年计划建设打下了良好基础。
    会议认为：代表们的革命英雄主义干劲，反映了自治区八百多万人民群众革命热情的新的高涨。这个革命干劲表现在讨论和确定新的工、农、牧业生产大跃进的振奋人心的指标上。
    在工业方面，会议确定在第二个五年计划期间基本建成包头工业基地。森林工业比现在扩大一倍以上。冶金、化学、机械、煤炭、电力、纺织、食品等各种工业部门都要建立起来；在十年到十五年内，使自治区成为祖国以钢铁为中心的重工业基地之一，并成为森林工业、食品工业的基地之一。会议要求大力普遍发展地方工业，使地方工业产值在第二个五年计划期间增长三点五倍，赶上或超过农牧业产值。加上中央下放工矿企业产值，到1962年地方工业产值在自治区工农业总产值中将占60％—70％。
    在农牧业方面，会议确定：一、粮食产量，在八年、七年或更短的时间内，全区平均每亩产粮四百斤，其中四个灌区要求在五年达到原订十年规划的指标。把合作社完全巩固起来，一年到三年赶上和超过富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平。二、畜牧业生产，在十年内牲畜总头数达到五千万头到六千万头，每年递增10％到12％。三年实现牧区合作化，五年基本解决人畜用水，消灭无水草原。五年之内基本实现定居游牧。三、水利方面，五年完成原订十年水利建设指标，使农田灌溉面积由1955年的八百七十八万亩，增加到四千五百万亩，作到每人平均六亩水地，基本实现水利化。四、水土保持。六年完成原订十年任务，控制水土流失面积十万平方公里。八年造林四百万公顷，封山育林四百万公顷，五年内完成绿化任务。五、除四害。城镇两年实现，农村四年实现。牧区定居地四年消灭老鼠、蚊、蝇、虱子，五年之内消灭狼害。
    会议指出：为了给第二个五年计划作出一个良好的开端，今年必须使各项生产有一个飞跃的发展。会议决定今年粮食总产量达到一百零四亿斤，牲畜总头数达到两千四百零六万头，生猪达到两百三十万口，地方工业总产值达到四亿多元，造林面积十万公顷。
    会议认为，取得工农牧业生产大跃进，掀起一个全面的生产建设高潮，使社会主义建设事业做到又多、又快、又好、又省，关键在于党的领导。会议要求首先加强政治思想的领导，坚决开展反对右倾保守思想和反对浪费的斗争。认真贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭持家的方针。集中全力领导好以工、农、牧业生产为中心的经济工作和文化教育工作，同时加强政治法律工作，进一步巩固人民民主专政。
    为实现党对上述工作的领导，会议决定这次下放干部要抽调一批地委级和相当于地委级的干部加强旗县；乡总支书记一般都应由原区委书记、县科长和县委委员充任；工矿企业领导薄弱也应当调整加强；中等学校都要建立起党的领导核心，要抽调一批适合作学校工作的较强的干部到中学去当校长和党委书记。
    会议还要求各级党委迅速派出得力干部，把应征和必须征购也能够征购的粮食征购起来。
    会议认为，反对地方民族主义是自治区两条道路斗争中的一个重要方面。近一年来地方民族主义有了新的滋长，因此，必须将反对地方民族主义的斗争进行到底。会议还强调提出，在反对地方民族主义的同时，要检查民族政策的执行情况，反对大汉族主义。会议通过了关于开除破坏民族团结和社会主义事业的资产阶级地方民族主义分子、内蒙古人民出版社社长特布信的党籍。
    会议充分发扬了民主，贯彻了整风精神，开展了思想交锋。在预备会议期间，代表们采取大鸣大放大争大字报的形式，向内蒙古党委和自治区一级领导机关提出许多批评和建议。内蒙古党委和自治区一级领导机关对代表们所提出的两千一百一十三条意见，件件都作了交代和处理。
