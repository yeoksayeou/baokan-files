    The Best Poem
    Five Years Look at Three Years, Three Years Look at the First Year, Production Great Leap Forward, One Day as Two Days
    Xiao San
    These days, in Huairen Hall in the capital, we are sharing another "unusual spring" with the people of the whole country.
    The representatives from all over the country attending the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress are unfolding magnificent pictures of the socialist construction of the motherland on this solemn forum. Their speeches are the most beautiful and moving poems!
    Please read these beautiful verses that describe the enthusiasm for labor and inspire revolutionary vigor. Zhao Wenfu, a representative from Henan, fired the first shot in the discussion of the conference. He said that the new upsurge of production and construction of the people of the whole province is:
    The daytime is pitch black, and the night is full of lights.
    The people there proposed:
    The mountains are harder than our determination,
    The mountains are higher than the soles of our feet.
    We will make 913 mountain tops,
    Bow their heads to the people one by one.
    They described the people's vigor like this:
    The youth's energy rivals Zhao Yun. The strength of the middle-aged rivals Wu Song. Children are like Luo Cheng. The old men work like Huang Zhong. The cadres plan better than Zhuge Liang. Women are better than Mu Guiying.
    The Hunan representative also quoted a similar mountain song:
    Our determination is like Yu Gong's.
    Our energy rivals Wu Song's.
    Our strength is greater than the sky.
    Our enthusiasm is like fire.
    Hubei farmers build water conservancy projects, and the construction site at night is:
    The sky is full of stars, and the ground is full of lights.
    We will turn the Longqing Temple, into a Crystal Palace.
    We moved mountains,
    Cut off many cliffs,
    And changed the course of many rivers.
    The masses in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang said:
    Production leap forward warms people's hearts,
    Not afraid of the bone-chilling wind and snow.
    The county's four-level cadre conference decided:
    Mountains and rivers can be changed, and the leap forward is not difficult. We must jump resolutely and fiercely, jump to the north of the Yellow River this year, jump to the south of the Yellow River in three years, and cross the Yangtze River within ten years. If there is not enough manure, we can accumulate more. If the seeds are not pure, we will select them carefully. If there is not enough animal power, we will set up "Yellow Cattle Training Classes". If there is not enough time, we will get up early and work late.
    The farmers created "ice lanterns." Looking from afar along the Songhua River, they look like a winding Great Wall. In reality, they are the ice lanterns of tens of thousands of farmers working night shifts:
    Red flags flutter during the day, and lights are bright at night. The winter in "Beidahuang" has also become spring, the black sky has become the day, and the old men are as good as the youth.
    Party members, League members, cadres and the masses in Shibanfang Village on the top of Taihang Mountain in Xingtai, Hebei Province are building water conservancy projects, overcoming mountains and ridges. Despite the cold weather and wind and snow, people are becoming more and more energetic and boldly express:
    The cold cannot stop the enthusiasm, the frozen ground cannot stop the determination, the heavy snow cannot cover the confidence, and the strong wind cannot blow down the perseverance.
    The commune members of Shucheng Township in Hejian sang for the 25-mile canal they completed:
    The day before yesterday at sunset, the river was in the west depression;
    This morning the sun rises, and the canal water arrives in the village;
    At noon the sun is in the south, and the canal water surrounds the village.
    In the past, Liaoning was "many mountains, none of them not bald, many rivers, none of them not dry"; now it must be:
    All mountains are green. All waters are clear.
    The riverbeds are narrowed. The gullies are leveled.
    Xuyong County, Sichuan Province is a high mountain area. The people there are working on a Luoguo Mountain, with a total of more than 2,600 people working on the mountain every day. The gongs and drums are loud, and the mountain is full of red flags, which is even more lively than the New Year. The slogan put forward by this labor army is:
    "Not afraid of cold, not afraid of hunger, Luoguo Mountain must admit its mistake to me."
    Everyone brings dry food to the mountain before dawn and does not return until dark. Several times it rained, but few people were absent. They always worked hard to the end. Soon, they dressed up this Luoguo Mountain, which had been in the cold palace and had a sad face, so that it was neatly dressed and had a clear eyebrow.
    The Miao farmers marched towards the mountains to divert water. They proposed:
    If the ditch is not clear, we will not relax,
    If the water does not reach the fields, we will not go home for the New Year.
    The people of Shaanxi Province built water conservancy projects, building "Suspended Weirs", "Tunnel Weirs", and "Contour Weirs", so that rice fields went up the Qinling Mountains and the Bashan Mountains. The masses said: "Zhuge Liang once wanted to divert water to Yuan (Wuzhangyuan) to solve the problem of drinking water for the soldiers, but he did not succeed. Today, the Communist Party leads us and has actually built water to Wuzhangyuan, and rice fields fly to the mountains."
    The heroic spirit of the poor mountain people is:
    The mountain is not as high as the hoe,
    The stone is not as hard as the hammer.
    Xinchang Township, Dading County, is a high and cold mountain area. In the past, there was a folk song that said: "Rice seedlings are planted in June. Rice is harvested in the snow. Thirtieth night threshing straw, New Year's meal rice is not available". Now, listen to a new mountain song:
    Heavy snow flutters, bone-piercingly cold,
    Everyone builds ponds with one heart.
    Men, women, old and young all work together,
    What is lifted into a pile is originally random stones.
    The masses in Fuwan Township, Gucheng County, Hubei Province, composed a quick-board rhyme and sang it everywhere:
    River beaches become fertile fields. Bald mountains become good mountains.
    Everyone works harder, and happiness is in sight.
    From the county party secretary to the commune director and production team leader in Macheng County, Hubei Province, all plant experimental fields, which is well known to everyone. The cotton production there has a leap forward, and the farmers sing:
    Hundreds of acres of sandy beaches become fertile fields,
    The vast sea of cotton rolls into snowballs,
    This year there was a severe drought for ninety days,
    The yield of cotton and wheat per mu reaches one thousand.
    In order to strive for a bumper harvest this year, the people of Jiangxi Province, in some places, put forward:
    Seize sunny days, grab cloudy days,
    Treat windy and drizzle days as good days.
    Heavy rain, small work, light rain, hard work,
    No rain, desperately work,
    Work early and late as half a day,
    Under the lamp as daytime,
    One day's work as two days,
    Completing the task is better than celebrating the New Year.
    The masses in Guangxi expressed their determination and confidence with such mountain songs:
    Don't rely on God, rely on ourselves, build water conservancy to overcome it, even if God does not rain, we will make the seedlings sprout.
    A thousand years of drought, tears streaming down, only knowing to ask God and worship heaven, now with the Communist Party, we can build water conservancy and celebrate a bumper year.
    Accumulating fertilizer is a major event. Zhang Huiying, a representative from Yunnan Province, is an ordinary farmer in Yongxin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yiliang County. He said that some members of their cooperative proposed:
    If you want crops to look good,
    The manure basket should be hung on your shoulders.
    Compare manure piles in winter,
    Compare grain piles in autumn.
    The people of Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, proposed:
    Dig out the bottom of the bubble, push down the old wall roots,
    All manure sources are turned upside down,
    Resolutely achieve four hundred catties.
    Hongwei Commune compiled a jingle for Grandma Li, saying:
    Snow is three feet deep and the north wind is blowing, women are saving manure non-stop, there is a grandma named Li, over sixty and four winters; women elected her as the group leader, she is willing to lead the troops, picking manure is better than young men, no less than Mu Guiying in those years.
    Soil improvement is a major event in agricultural production. The farmers in Heilongjiang said:
    One hoe doesn't move, two hoes are as hard as steel,
    After five or six hoes, cracks appear,
    After eight or nine hoes, the basket is full.
    The farmers also sang their praises for the cadres who participated in labor, participated in grassroots work and production:
    In the old society, the county magistrate went up the mountain in a sedan chair,
    In the new society, the county magistrate goes up the mountain to plant trees.
    Leaders do not eat three points of soil,
    Planning is equal to nonsense.
    The longer you hold the hoe, the more you master the technology.
    At the end of his speech, Lu Hongbin, a labor model from Shandong, couldn't help but say a quick-board rhyme:
    North of the city, south of the Luo River, the Patriotic Commune is in the middle.
    East is adjacent to the Shu River, west is backed by Yuhuang Mountain,
    There are mountains, rivers and plains.
    After the Second Five-Year Plan is realized,
    The mountains are green, the waters are clear, and there are fields everywhere,
    Years of barren mountains become orchards,
    Bad land becomes fertile fields.
    One year exceeds five hundred catties,
    Five years across the Yangtze River,
    Years of thatched houses become tiled eaves,
    Every family has surplus grain and every household has surplus money.
    Only then will we know that our life is really happy.
    All of this is inseparable from the leadership of the Party, please listen to how the people praise the Communist Party.
    The farmers of Shaanxi Province sang:
    The world is changing so strangely,
    Corn yields two thousand and two,
    Always listen to the Party's words,
    The output really grows fast!
    Communes beat gongs and drums in a mess,
    Singing about collectivization,
    Get fertilizer,
    Build dams,
    Call the water straight to the original!
    The harvest grows every year,
    Grain and cotton are as beautiful as mountains!
    The facts before our eyes will speak,
    Only then do we believe that the strength of socialism is great,
    Eating rice does not forget the rice growers,
    The Communist Party is our dear parents!
    The poems recited by the people's representatives are really beautiful. This is only a part of the representatives' speeches up to the afternoon of February 8. In addition, such as Deng Chumin's old man's speech quoted Xie Lao's poem, and also concluded with his own poetic sentence, which will not be quoted here.
    This year is the first year of my country's Second Five-Year Plan, and it is also the first year to catch up with the United Kingdom in terms of the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years. The plan for the year lies in the spring. It is ideal to hold this meeting at the beginning of the year. At this time, how many beautiful songs are being sung and how many magnificent poems are being written all over the country! These are the best poems! Poets, read more such poems, go and become one with the people, and write such good poems!

    最好的诗
    五年看三年　三年看头年　生产大跃进　一天当两天
    萧三
    这些日子在首都怀仁堂里，我们和全国人民共度着另一个“不平常的春天”。
    从全国各地来到这里出席第一届人民代表大会第五次会议的代表，在这个庄严的讲坛上，展开一幅又一幅祖国社会主义建设的壮丽图画。他们的发言就是一篇又一篇最美和最动人的诗歌！
    请读读这些描写劳动热情、鼓舞革命干劲的优美的诗句。河南代表赵文甫的发言打响了大会讨论的第一炮。他说全省人民的生产建设新高潮是：
    白天一片黑，夜间遍地灯。
    那里的人民提出：
    山硬硬不过决心，
    山高高不过脚心。
    要使九百一十三个山头，
    一个个的向人民低头。
    他们这样描述人民的干劲：
    青年劲头赛赵云。壮年力气赛武松。少年儿童像罗成。老人干活似黄忠。干部策划胜诸葛。妇女赛过穆桂英。
    湖南代表也引了类似的一支山歌：
    我们的决心似愚公。
    我们的劲头赛武松。
    我们的力量比天大。
    我们的热情像火红。
    湖北农民修水利，夜晚工地上是：
    天上满天星，地下万盏灯。
    要把龙青寺，变为水晶宫。
    把一座座的高山搬了家，
    把许多悬崖斩了腰，
    把许多河流改了道。
    黑龙江肇源县的群众说：
    生产跃进人心暖，
    不怕风雪刺骨寒。
    全县四级干部大会上议定：
    山河都可改，跃进也不难，要坚决的跳，狠狠的跳，今年跳到黄河北，三年跳到黄河南，十年之内过长江。粪肥不足可以多攒，种子不纯精细挑选；畜力不足开展“黄牛训练班”，时间不足起早贪黑干。
    农民创造了“冰灯”，从远方沿松花江望去好像是蜿蜒如蛇的长城，实际是上万农民干夜班的冰灯：
    白日红旗招展，夜晚灯火齐明，“北大荒”的冬天，也变成了春天，黑天变成了白天，老汉也赛如青年。
    河北邢台石板房村太行山山顶上的党团员和干部群众开山过岭修水利，尽管天寒地冻，风雪逼人，人们愈干劲愈足，豪迈地表示：
    天冷冷不住热心，地冻冻不住决心，大雪盖不住信心，大风刮不倒恒心。
    河间束城乡的社员为自己完成了的二十五里渠道唱道：
    前天夕阳下，河水在西洼；
    今晨旭日升，渠水到村东；
    中午日正南，渠水围村转。
    辽宁过去是“山多、无山不秃，河多、无河不干”；现在要做到：
    有山皆绿。有水皆清。
    河套挤窄。沟子弄平。
    四川叙永县是个高山区，那里的人民搞一座罗锅山，每天一共有二千六百多人在山上工作。锣鼓喧天，满山红旗，比逢年过节还要热闹。这支劳动大军提出的口号是：
    “不怕冷，不怕饿，罗锅山得向我认错。”
    大家不等天亮就带起干粮上山，直到天黑才回。有好几次下雨，可是很少有人缺勤，他们总是一股子劲干到底。不久就把这座打入冷宫、愁眉苦脸的罗锅山，硬是打扮得衣冠楚楚、眉清目秀了。
    苗族农民群众向山头进军，引水。提出：
    沟不通，不放松，
    水不到田，不回去过年。
    陕西省人民修水利，修成了“悬天堰”、“穿山堰”、“环山堰”，使稻田上了秦岭，上了巴山。群众说：“诸葛亮当年曾想引水上原（五丈原），解决军士吃水问题，但没有做到。今天共产党领导我们，居然办到了水上五丈原，稻田飞上山”。
    穷苦山区人民的英雄气概是：
    山高没有锄头高，
    石硬没有铁锤硬。
    大定县新场乡是个高寒山区，过去有首歌谣说：“栽秧栽到六月。割谷割到下雪。三十夜打谷草，年饭米都不得”。现在呢，且听一首新山歌：
    大雪飘飘透骨冰，
    大家筑塘很齐心。
    男女老少齐动手，
    抬成堆的原是乱石头。
    湖北谷城县傅湾乡的群众编出一首快板，到处传唱：
    河滩变良田。秃山变良山。
    大家加油干，幸福在眼前。
    湖北麻城县从县委书记到社主任、生产队长都种试验田，这是大家闻名的。那里的棉花生产有跃进之势，农民唱道：
    百亩沙滩变良田，
    茫茫棉海滚雪团，
    今年大旱九十天，
    棉麦亩产到一千。
    江西省人民为争取今年大丰收，有的地方群众提出：
    抓晴天，抢阴天，
    大风细雨当好天。
    大雨小干，小雨大干，
    无雨拼命干，
    赶早摸黑当半天，
    灯底下当白天，
    一天功夫当两天，
    完成任务好过年。
    广西的群众用这样的山歌表达了自己的决心和信心：
    不靠老天靠自家，兴修水利战胜它，就是老天不下雨，也叫禾苗出嫩芽。
    千年苦旱泪涟涟，只知求神和拜天，如今有了共产党，修好水利庆丰年。
    积肥是大事。云南省张惠英代表是宜良县永新农业生产合作社一个普通的农民，他说，他们社里有些社员提出：
    要想庄稼像个样，
    粪箕要挂在肩膀上。
    冬季比粪堆，
    秋季比谷堆。
    黑龙江肇源县人民提出：
    挖出包泡底，推倒老墙根，
    所有粪源大翻身，
    坚决实现四百斤。
    宏伟社给李大娘编了个顺口溜说：
    雪下三尺刮北风，妇女攒粪不消停，有位大娘本姓李，年过六十零四冬；妇女选她当组长，她愿挂帅去领兵，拣粪赛过青年汉，不亚当年穆桂英。
    改良土壤是农业生产的大事。黑龙江的农民说：
    一镐没刨动，二镐硬如钢，
    五、六镐后刨裂缝，
    八、九镐后装满筐。
    农民们对干部参加劳动，参加基层工作和生产，也唱出了他们的颂歌：
    旧社会县长上山用轿抬，
    新社会县长上山把树栽。
    领导不吃三分土，
    计划等于瞎胡走。
    锄头拿得久，技术才到手。
    山东劳动模范吕鸿宾代表发言到末了，禁不住说了一段快板：
    城北洛河南，爱国社在中间。
    东临沭河岸，西靠玉皇山，
    有山有水有平原。
    第二个五年计划实现后，
    山青水秀遍地是畦田，
    多年的荒山变果园，
    不好的土地变良田。
    一年超过五百斤，
    五年跨过长江南，
    多年的草房变成瓦屋檐，
    家家有余粮，户户有余钱。
    到那时才知道我们的生活实在是美满。
    这一切的一切都离不了党的领导，请听人民如何歌颂共产党的。
    陕西省农民群众唱道：
    世事翻新真奇怪，
    玉米打了二千二，
    永远要听党的话，
    产量真个长的快！
    社社锣鼓乱敲打，
    声声歌唱合作化，
    搞积肥，
    修水坝，
    叫水直往原上爬；
    年年收成只管长，
    粮、棉如山美札啦！
    眼前实事会说话，
    才信社会主义力量大，
    吃米不忘种谷人，
    共产党就是咱的亲爹妈！
    人民代表们所念出来的诗歌，真是美不胜收。这里只是截至2月8日下午为止代表们发言的一部分。此外，如邓初民老人的发言引了谢老的诗，也自己用诗句作结，这里就不再引了。
    今年是我国第二个五年计划的头一年，也是要在十五年内在钢铁及其他重要工业产品在产量方面赶上英国的头一年。一年之计在于春。这次会议在年初举行是最理想的。在这时候，全国各地正唱着多少美丽的歌，写着多少雄伟的诗！这些都是最好的诗！诗人们，多读些这样的诗吧，去和人民群众打成一片，也写出这样的好诗来吧！
