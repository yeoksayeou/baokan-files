Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: According to TASS, Japanese Communist Party Diet member Kanichi Kawakami questioned the government on the 17th in the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee regarding the issue of the United States transporting atomic and hydrogen weapons into Japan. He pointed out that the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the Far East is equipped with nuclear weapons and questioned Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, asking whether the government could prove that U.S. warships and aircraft stationed in Japan are not equipped with such weapons. Aiichiro Fujiyama avoided giving a direct answer. He expressed his hope that the United States would not transport nuclear weapons into Japan.

Kawakami Kanichi said that the government's empty guarantees cannot reassure the Japanese people, who resolutely demand the prohibition of nuclear weapons and oppose the deployment of such weapons within Japan. To this end, Kawakami Kanichi requested that the Japanese government exchange public documents with the United States stipulating that the United States must not transport nuclear weapons into Japan. Kawakami Kanichi then said that if the United States refuses to do so, then the Japanese government should take the initiative to issue a statement refusing to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan. The Foreign Minister also refused to give a clear answer on this point.

The Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" pointed out that although the Japanese government has expressed its hope that the United States will not transport nuclear weapons into Japan, the vast majority of the Japanese public holds great doubts about these statements by the government. The newspaper emphasized that the process of parliamentary debate shows that the government cannot give any legal guarantees on this issue. The newspaper went on to say that, therefore, not only in the Japanese Socialist Party and other democratically-minded classes, but even among some people in the ruling party, there is an increasingly strong demand to conclude an agreement with the United States prohibiting the transport of atomic and hydrogen weapons into Japan.

    日共议员要政府明确保证
    不准美国把核武器运进日本
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社东京18日讯：日本共产党议员川上贯一17日在国会众议院外交委员会就美国把原子武器和氢武器运进日本的问题向政府提出质询。他指出在远东海面上的美国第七舰队配备有核武器，并且质问外务相藤山爱一郎说，政府是否能够证明驻在日本的美国军舰和飞机不配备这种武器。藤山爱一郎避而不作正面答复。他表示希望美国不把核武器运进日本。
    川上贯一说，政府的空洞的保证并不能使日本人民安心，日本人民坚决要求禁止核武器和反对在日本境内配置这种武器。为此，川上贯一要求日本政府同美国交换公开文件，规定美国不得把核武器运进日本。川上贯一接着说，如果美国拒绝这样做，那末日本政府就应当主动地发表拒绝在日本配置核武器的声明。外务相对这点也拒绝做明确的答复。
    日本“每日新闻”指出，尽管日本政府表示希望美国不把核武器运进日本，但是日本的广大公众对政府的这些声明抱着很大的怀疑。报纸强调说，国会辩论的过程表明，政府对这个问题不能给以任何法律保证。报纸接着说，因此不仅在日本社会党和其他怀有民主情绪的阶层中，甚至在执政党的某些人士中，也越来越有力地主张同美国缔结禁止把原子武器和氢武器运进日本的协定。
