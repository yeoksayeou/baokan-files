Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: Striving to achieve the grain and cotton production increase targets set in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) this year is the goal proposed by agricultural labor models and activists in Beijing during the discussion of the "Beijing Suburban 1958 Agricultural Production Great Leap Forward Struggle Program" at the conference which closed today. The conference opened on the 23rd, with more than two thousand agricultural labor models, activists, and district, township, and commune cadres participating.

The conference also guaranteed that the capital's vegetable needs would be fully self-sufficient and pork basically self-sufficient (including the Tongxian Special District, the capital's pig production base); suburban farmers would be self-sufficient in food grains, cooking oil, and livestock feed; comprehensive agricultural water conservancy would be realized; all barren hills and wastelands would be basically eliminated, and the task of greening the capital would be completed.

The conference was filled with revolutionary zeal. Representatives from various districts, townships, and communes posted big-character posters and letters of determination and guarantees on the site, launching competitions with each other. Each district, township, and commune put forward their advanced production increase targets and specific measures. Some agricultural cooperatives that had already achieved the grain production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) last year put forward guarantees to "cross the Yangtze River," and some even strived to become "thousand-jin communes."

Zhao Fan, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a concluding speech at the meeting. He requested that Party committees at all levels ensure that the secretary takes the lead, mobilizing the entire Party and all the people, working tensely from spring to winter, and that all agricultural cooperatives achieve ten "goods" and ten "comparisons." The ten "goods" are: to prepare the land well, select good seeds, apply fertilizer well, irrigate well, sow well, protect seedlings well, remove weeds well, prevent and control pests and diseases well, harvest well, and deliver (deliver public grain, sell grain), distribute, and store well. The ten "comparisons" are: to compare ideology, compare drive, compare targets, compare measures, compare actions, compare leadership, compare methods, compare attendance rate, compare costs, and compare yields.

Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, presented flags, medals, and prizes to the representatives of 335 model units and 350 labor models and model cadres at the meeting.

Before the end of the conference, Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered an important speech. He called on everyone to carry out rectification to the end, thoroughly eliminate bureaucratism, lethargy, extravagance, squeamishness, and arrogance, launch a mass movement against waste and conservatism, compare advanced experiences, and strive for greater, faster, better, and more economical results to achieve the Forty Articles ahead of schedule. He also asked everyone to immediately prepare drainage and irrigation machinery to prepare for drought prevention and strive for a bumper harvest this year.

The city's Young Pioneers presented the conference with a Red Scarf Tractor Station with eight tractors to support the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. (Attached picture)

    这个大会充满了革命干劲。各区、乡、社的代表纷纷在会场上贴出了互相展开竞赛的大字报和决心书、保证书。每个区、乡、社都提出了他们的先进增产指标和具体措施，一些去年已经实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的粮食增产指标的农业社，都提出了过“长江”的保证，有的还要争取成为“千斤社”。
    中共北京市委农村工作部部长赵凡在会上作了总结发言，他要求各级党委要作到书记动手，全党全民动员，春夏秋冬，紧张到底，所有农业社要作到十好十比，就是要整好地，选好种，施好肥，浇好水，播好种，保好苗，除好草，防治好病虫害，收获好，交售（交公粮、售粮）、分配、保管好；十比就是要比思想，比干劲，比指标，比措施，比行动，比领导，比方法，比出勤率，比成本，比产量。
    北京市副市长张友渔在会上把奖旗、奖章和奖品发给三百三十五名模范单位的代表和三百五十名劳动模范和模范干部。
    在大会结束以前，中共北京市委第一书记彭真到会作了重要讲话。他号召大家把整风坚持到底，彻底打掉官气、暮气、阔气、娇气、骄气，开展反浪费反保守、比先进、比多快好省的群众运动，争取提前实现四十条纲要。他还要大家立即抓紧准备排水灌溉机械，以备防旱，争取今年的大丰收。
