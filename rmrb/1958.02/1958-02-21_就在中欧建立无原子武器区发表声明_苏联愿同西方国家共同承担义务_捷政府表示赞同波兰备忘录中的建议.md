Xinhua News Agency, February 20th News: TASS, Moscow, February 19th: The Soviet government issued a statement on establishing a region in Central Europe that would not produce or deploy atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. The statement said that the Soviet government believes that, in order to effectively realize the proposal to establish a region in Central Europe that does not produce and deploy atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons, it is necessary that, in addition to the countries located in this region undertaking corresponding obligations, those major powers whose own armies are equipped with nuclear and rocket weapons should also undertake solemn obligations: to respect the status of the region and to regard the territory of the countries included in the region as an area where the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons is prohibited.

This requires that the aforementioned major powers must not equip their own armies and the armies of other countries located in this region with nuclear weapons and rocket weapons, that they must not supply such weapons to the governments of the countries in this region or to armed forces stationed in this region under the command of military groups, and that they must not import or build equipment and military technology for nuclear weapons, including rocket launchers.

The Soviet government solemnly declares that, pending an agreement on the complete prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons and the elimination of such weapons from national armaments, the Soviet Union is prepared to undertake the aforementioned obligations if the governments of the United States, Britain, and France do the same.

The statement first pointed out that, today, nothing can give mankind greater hope for a peaceful and tranquil future than prohibiting atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons and ensuring that atomic energy is used only for peaceful purposes and to benefit mankind. Precisely for this reason, for more than a decade, the Soviet Union has been extremely determined to strive to realize these aspirations of all mankind.

However, regrettably, the countries that possess nuclear weapons in their armaments—the United States and Britain—have not been sincere in taking fundamental measures such as prohibiting atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons and eliminating such weapons from armaments. They regard these weapons of mass destruction as a "deterrent" and believe that this means can guarantee the realization of their political goals. The Western countries, infatuated with this dangerous delusion, are even unwilling to take measures to stop testing such weapons.

However, the people of all countries are increasingly determined to demand an end to the arms race, including the production of nuclear weapons, and an end to the threat of atomic war.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet government fully supports the proposal put forward by the Polish government and endorsed by the governments of Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic to establish a region in Central Europe that does not produce and deploy atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. The realization of this measure would help to take other measures to eliminate the threat of atomic war, and this would be a valuable contribution to ensuring peace in Central Europe.

Establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in Europe is in line with the fundamental interests of the people of all European countries, who are deeply concerned about the danger of a war using atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and who are very clear about how tragic the consequences of using such weapons, especially in densely populated areas of Europe, would be.

The statement emphasized that the realization of the proposal to establish the aforementioned region would have a beneficial impact on the entire international situation and would help to create the necessary conditions for taking further and more fundamental measures in disarmament and resolving other important international issues.

The Soviet government's statement concluded by saying that the Soviet government hopes that the governments of all countries that possess nuclear weapons and rocket weapons, as well as the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, will pay attention to the significance of this humanitarian action, participate in this action, and thereby practically promote the realization of the following goals: preventing the mad attempt to drag the world into the disaster of atomic war.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 20th: According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency on the 19th, Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David handed a note to the Polish Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Mazur, on the 19th, in response to the Polish government's memorandum on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

The note pointed out that the Czechoslovak government agrees with the proposals in the Polish government's memorandum and is willing to contribute all its efforts to the realization of these proposals. The note said that the Czechoslovak government believes that the Polish government's proposal provides a realistic basis for concrete negotiations on the issue of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The memorandum more clearly specifies the obligations of the countries in this region, as well as the obligations of the four major powers and other countries. It takes into account the results of discussions on Poland's proposals to date. Therefore, the Czechoslovak government believes that the Polish government's proposal opens the way to reaching an agreement.

The Czechoslovak government expressed its hope that, if the participating parties are sincere, it is now possible to realize this proposal.

The note said that the Czechoslovak government and all the people sincerely hope to gradually reach the broadest disarmament agreement and establish the most effective European collective security system. Therefore, the Czechoslovak government fully supports the Soviet government's proposal to convene a summit meeting in the near future to discuss measures aimed at eliminating the "Cold War" and strengthening world peace and security, including the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

### 就在中欧建立无原子武器区发表声明  苏联愿同西方国家共同承担义务  捷政府表示赞同波兰备忘录中的建议

    就在中欧建立无原子武器区发表声明
    苏联愿同西方国家共同承担义务
    捷政府表示赞同波兰备忘录中的建议
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联政府发表了关于在中欧建立一个不生产、不配置原子武器和氢武器地区的声明。声明说，苏联政府认为，要有效地实现在中欧建立一个不生产和不配置原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器的地区的建议，就需要除了位于这个地区的国家承担相应的义务而外，那些自己军队中装备有核武器和火箭武器的大国也应该承担庄严的义务：尊重该地区的地位和把包括在该地区的国家的领土看做是禁止使用原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器的区域。
    这就要求上述大国必须不以核武器和火箭武器装备位于这一地区的本国军队和其他国家的军队，要求它们必须不把这种武器供给这个地区的国家政府或驻扎在这一地区、受军事集团指挥的武装部队，也不得输入和建造供核武器用的装备和军事技术，其中包括火箭发射装置。
    苏联政府郑重地宣布，在达成完全禁止原子武器和氢武器的协议以及把这种武器从各国武装中取缔以前，苏联准备承担起上述义务，如果美国、英国和法国政府也这样做的话。
    声明首先指出，现今，除了禁止原子武器和氢武器以及保证使原子能仅用于和平的目的和造福人类以外，再没有什么东西可以给人类带来对和平和安宁的未来以更大的希望了。正因为这样，十年多来，苏联一直极其坚决地为实现全人类的这些愿望而奋斗。
    然而很遗憾，在军备中拥有核武器的国家——美国和英国却没有诚意采取诸如禁止原子武器和氢武器并把这种武器从军备中取缔的根本措施。它们把这种大规模毁灭性武器看作是一种“威慑手段”，而且它们认为，这种手段可以保证实现它们的政治目的。迷恋于这种危险的妄想的西方国家甚至连停止试验这种武器的措施都不肯采取。
    然而，各国人民越来越坚决地要求结束包括核武器生产在内的军备竞赛，结束原子战争的威胁。
    声明指出，苏联政府完全支持波兰政府提出的并得到捷克斯洛伐克和民主德国政府赞同的在中欧建立不生产和不配置原子武器和氢武器的地区的建议。实现这一措施就会有助于采取消除产生原子战争威胁的其他措施，这将是对保证中欧和平的一个有价值的贡献。
    在欧洲建立无核武器地区是符合所有欧洲国家人民的根本利益的，他们深深地耽心使用原子武器和氢武器的战争的危险，他们十分清楚，使用这种武器，特别是在欧洲人口稠密的地区，会造成多么悲惨的后果。
    声明强调说，实现建立上述地区的建议会对整个国际局势产生良好影响，并且有助于为在裁军和解决其他重要国际问题方面采取进一步、更根本的措施创造必要的条件。
    苏联政府的声明最后说，苏联政府希望拥有核武器和火箭武器的各国政府以及德意志联邦共和国政府能重视这种人道行动的意义，参加这个行动，从而在行动上促进下列目标的实现：制止把世界拖进原子战争灾祸中去的疯狂企图。
    据新华社布拉格20日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社19日报道：捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维19日向波兰驻捷克斯洛伐克大使马茹尔递交了一项照会，答复波兰政府关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的备忘录。
    照会指出，捷克斯洛伐克政府赞同波兰政府备忘录中的各项建议，并且愿意为实现这些建议贡献出一切力量。照会说，捷克斯洛伐克政府认为，波兰政府的建议为具体谈判建立无原子武器地区的问题提供了一个现实的基础。备忘录更加明确地说明了这个地区的国家的义务，以及四大国和其它国家的义务。它把到目前为止关于波兰的建议的讨论结果都考虑在内了。因此，捷克斯洛伐克政府认为，波兰政府的建议为达成协议开辟了道路。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府表示希望：如果参加方面有诚意的话，现在就有可能实现这个建议。
    照会说，捷克斯洛伐克政府和全体人民真诚希望能够逐步达成最广泛的裁军协议和建立最有效的欧洲集体安全体系。因此，捷克斯洛伐克政府完全支持苏联政府关于在最近召开最高级会议的建议，以便讨论包括在中欧建立无原子武器地区在内的旨在消除“冷战”和加强世界和平与安全的措施。
