　　“Politics is for others?”
　　Zhong Huai
    Recently, while reading the newspaper, I saw that two units, in discussing the relationship between "redness" and "expertise," presented these two views:
    "Technical skill is one's own asset, politics is for others."
    "Studying politics is for the public, studying professional skills is for oneself."
    Half of these two statements are the same, that is, technical skill or professional ability is one's own. The other half is slightly different; one says politics is "for others," and the other says politics is "for the public." But upon thinking it over, I feel they are completely the same. Because the "for others" in the first statement is precisely the "for the public" in the second statement. The public equals others—this is precisely the formula of this kind of person.
    Thus, I suddenly realize that the reason some people only want "expertise" and not "redness" is that "expertise" is their own, while "redness" is not!
    Is politics really not one's own? Even if "technical skill is one's own asset." Since it is an "asset," unless one hoards it like a miser guarding gold, it must be put to use. Once it is put to use, the problem arises: For whom are you preparing to use it? How will you use it? In other words, whom are your technical skills (or professional abilities) prepared to serve? How will they serve? This is not a problem of the technical skill (or professional ability) itself, but a political problem. How can this politics not be one's own but "for others" or "for the public"? We regard the "public" as an aggregate of many "selves," as consistent with oneself—this is a standpoint, a kind of "politics." While another kind of person regards the public as others, as opposed to oneself—this is also a standpoint, also a kind of politics. Isn't this second kind of politics precisely the politics of this second kind of person himself? How can it be pushed onto "others"?
    Someone might say: The politics I am talking about is not this meaning; I am talking about engaging in political activities or doing political work. Therefore, I think administrative cadres are direct successors, and they should be deeply red; while technical personnel are indirect successors, and having a light shade of red is enough. However, this is not the case. Because the problem also has another aspect: Political workers also have white and red distinctions. It goes without saying that bourgeois political activists are white, but haven't rightist elements also appeared in the Party's staff and in the legal organs of the proletarian dictatorship? In essence, aren't they also white? It can be seen that "politics" is mainly a matter of a person's political stance and political viewpoint.
    Why not recall what you thought and said during the initial stages of the rectification campaign's great debates and the anti-Rightist struggle? Where was your butt sitting? Was it sitting on the side of the working class or on the side of the bourgeois rightists? Or did it waver between the two? Isn't "where one's butt is sitting" politics? Along with the standpoint come the viewpoint and method. Taking the relationship between "redness" and "expertise" as an example, from the perspective of the working class, one demands "both red and expert," so as to build a cadre team that can withstand risks and strive for the cause of communism. In the eyes of the working class, these two are a unity of opposites, with politics as the commander and the guarantee of professional skills. But from the bourgeois viewpoint, one demands "only expertise and no redness" or the so-called "expertise first, redness later," which, translated into popular language, means only personal fame and gain, no politics (naturally the politics of the working class), no ideological transformation, no change of standpoint. According to this viewpoint, the contradiction between "redness" and "expertise" cannot be reconciled. Isn't it true that learning technical skills and professional abilities benefits oneself; while politics talks about serving the people, serving socialism, anyway, serving "others," serving the "public"? How can these two be put together! Sorry, you want to abandon politics, but in reality, you only abandon a politics of serving the people, while retaining a politics of serving individuals or serving capitalism, which is precisely the bourgeois political viewpoint. If it is not the politics of the working class, it is the politics of the bourgeoisie. This politics is definitely not "for others" or "for the public," but is "your own."
    Someone compared politics to the soul, which is a good analogy. People must have a soul, which can be beautiful and proletarian; or ugly and bourgeois. Advocating both redness and expertise is precisely to make you a smart, capable person with a beautiful soul. Where else is there to go! Could a person become a walking corpse!

### “政治是别人的”？

　　“政治是别人的”？
　　锺怀
    最近读报，看到有两个单位在讨论“红”与“专”的关系时，出现了这样两种说法——
    “技术是自己的本钱，政治是别人的。”
    “学习政治是公家的，学习业务是自己的。”
    两种说法，有一半是相同的，即技术或业务是自己的。有一半稍有不同，一个说政治是“别人的”，另一个说政治是“公家的”。但想了一想，又觉得是完全相同的。因为前面的“别人的”，也正是后面的“公家的”，公家等于别人，正是这种人的公式。
    于是，我便恍然大悟，有些人所以只要“专”不要“红”，原来因为“专”是自己的，“红”则不是自己的！
    政治果真不是自己的么？就算“技术是自己的本钱”。既是“本钱”，除非是守财奴样的守着金子不动，否则，总要派用场的。一派用场，问题就来了：你是准备为谁而用？怎样用法？换句话说，你的技术（或业务）准备为谁服务？怎样服务？这就不是技术（业务）本身的问题，而是政治问题了。这政治怎么不是自己的，而是“别人的”或“公家的”呢？我们把“公家”看作是许多“自己”的集合体，同自己是一致的，这是一种立场，是一种“政治”；而另一种人把公家看作别人，同自己是对立的，这又是一种立场，也是一种政治。后一种政治不正是这后一种人自己的，难道能推到“别人”身上去？
    或曰：我所说的政治不是这个意思，我是说的搞政治活动，或做政治工作。因此，我认为行政干部是直接接班人，他们要深红；而技术人员是间接接班人，有浅红色也就可以了。然而不然。因为问题还有它的另一方面：政治工作人员也还有白色红色之分。资产阶级的政治活动家是白色的不用说了，就是在党的工作人员以及无产阶级专政的法律机关中，不是也出现了右派分子吗？他们在实质上岂不也是白色的。可见，这“政治”主要还是一个人的政治立场和政治观点问题。
    不妨回想一下，在整风初期的大鸣大放和反右派斗争中，你想了些什么？说了些什么？你的屁股坐在哪里？是坐在工人阶级这一边，还是坐在资产阶级右派那一边？或者动摇于两者之间？这“屁股坐在哪里”难道不是政治？随着立场而来的，还有观点和方法。就拿这“红”与“专”的关系来说，从工人阶级的观点出发，就要求“又红又专”，这样才能建立起一支为共产主义事业奋斗的经得起风险的干部队伍。在工人阶级看来，这两者是矛盾的统一体，政治是统帅，又是业务的保证。而从资产阶级观点出发，则要求“只专不红”或说得好听一点的所谓“先专后红”，把它翻译成通俗的语言，就是只要个人名利，不要政治（自然是工人阶级的政治），不要思想改造，不要立场的转变。按照这种观点，“红”与“专”的矛盾是无法调和的。不是么，学了技术和业务对自己有好处；政治呢，讲的是为人民服务、为社会主义服务，反正是为“别人”、为“公家”，这两个怎么能够捏到一起呢！对不起，你想撇开政治，而实际上却只撇了一个为人民服务的政治，保留下来的是为个人或为资本主义服务的政治，这恰恰又是资产阶级的政治观点。不是工人阶级的政治，就是资产阶级的政治。这政治偏偏就不是“别人的”或“公家的”，而是你“自己的”。
    有人把政治比作灵魂，这是很好的譬喻。人总是要有灵魂的，这可以是美好的，无产阶级的；也可以是丑恶的，资产阶级的。提倡又红又专，正是要你成为一个聪明能干而又有美好灵魂的人。岂有他哉！难道人还能成为一个行尸走肉不成！
