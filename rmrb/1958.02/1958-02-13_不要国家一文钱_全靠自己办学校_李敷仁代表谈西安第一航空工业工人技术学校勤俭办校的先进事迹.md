I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and I fully agree with the speeches of Premier Zhou and the central comrades. I would like to talk about the advanced example of the Xi'an First Aviation Industry Workers' Technical School in "running the school thriftily and diligently." I welcome your corrections if anything is inappropriate.

After four years of hard work, they have trained more than 2,200 technical workers who are both red and expert, manufactured more than 1,000 machines and instruments, and created more than 2.1 million yuan of wealth for the country.

The Xi'an First Aviation Technical School was formally established in 1953. Under the correct leadership of party and government at all levels, they have worked hard for four years, training 2,280 technical workers for the country who are both red and expert. They have created more than 1,000 machines, instruments, and intuitive teaching aids for the school. Some instruments are the first successful trial production in the country. In particular, they have produced more than 2.1 million yuan of wealth for the country under difficult conditions. From this year on, the school's expenses will be completely self-sufficient, and it will train 300 technically skilled workers with socialist political consciousness for the country every year.

Fellow representatives! The teachers and students of this school are indeed lovely. When I started writing this draft, all the teachers and students in the school were enthusiastically discussing the action slogan: "Don't ask the state for a single penny, rely entirely on our own hands to run the school well," and discussing the "plan to strive for self-sufficiency in 1959." However, before my draft was finished, the Shaanxi Daily sent a telegram from the Xi'an First Aviation Technical School to Chairman Mao, saying: "Respected Chairman Mao! We report to you with excitement that we have decided to realize this year the original plan to strive for self-sufficiency in 1959." In less than a week, they advanced the time that is hard to buy with gold by one year. Where does their revolutionary zeal come from? As the telegram said: "Under the education of the Party for several years, all our teachers and students deeply know that every penny should be spent on the most needed construction cause during the great socialist construction period of the country." This fully illustrates the correctness of the Central Committee's policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, running enterprises with diligence and thrift, running schools with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift.

Grasp ideological and political work firmly, and turn difficult conditions into winning factors.

How does the Xi'an First Aviation Technical School run the school thriftily and diligently? Their summary says: "First of all, the Party Committee firmly grasps the leadership of ideological and political work." Originally, their school was in very difficult conditions when it was first established. Due to the firm grasp of ideological and political leadership, the difficulties have been turned into factors for victory. First, in terms of school buildings, they were the buildings of concentration camps left over from the Kuomintang. They were not only dilapidated and simple, but each teacher and student only occupied 1.3 square meters of rooms that let in wind and rain. How did the school overcome this difficulty? The three principals took the lead in living in one room for office work, meetings, and receiving guests. Teachers and students shared joys and sorrows, stacked beds, and lived together. Without classrooms, they built sheds with tar paper by themselves. It was hot in summer and cold in winter, and they went to the lecture hall while singing. Second, in terms of equipment, there were only 111 old machines at the beginning, 85 percent of which were belt lathes. Some were still machines from the Zhang Zuolin period, which the students called old-fashioned machines. As for planers, shapers, milling machines, slotting machines, grinding machines, etc., which were urgently needed, there was no money to buy them at all. What should we do? They gave full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, used their brains, thought of tricks, and tapped the potential of the equipment. The red horse and the pear blossom spear advanced on their own. Teachers and students worked hard for four years and created 634 intuitive teaching aids. They made more than 100 kinds of cutting tools and tools, and used the "three shifts and four rotations" internship method to first change seven belt lathes into electric lathes, which increased the speed of the main machines. Without a surface grinder, they used an old grinding wheel to modify it. Without a milling machine, they added a tool disc to a hex lathe for use. Without running water, they tried to dig wells themselves and used old water pumps and old gasoline drums to build a water tower. This creative labor saved the country more than 14,000 yuan in funds. They imitated the Soviet-style universal vise and the East German-style bench drill. After four years of hard work, they turned the concentration camp of the Kuomintang's anti-communist and anti-people's activities into a school with modern equipment serving socialism. Third, how did they strengthen ideological and political education to continuously improve students' enthusiasm and creativity? For example, when students first came to school, they showed various non-proletarian ideological consciousness due to different backgrounds. The school's Party Branch insisted on the instructions of the Central Committee, the Ministry, and the Bureau, strengthened the leadership of ideological and political work, and made it regular. According to the principle of combining production with internship, the organization was adjusted and a leadership system was established. According to the principle of running schools thriftily and diligently, the potential of equipment was fully tapped, and the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses were given full play. For this reason, the Party Branch paid special attention to regularly going deep into the student masses to understand their ideological and learning situations, and carried out class education, labor education, and self-education activities in a timely manner.

The school implemented the policy of combining politics with technology, and students created a variety of instruments and machines in production practice in the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical.

For the past four years, the Xi'an First Aviation Technical School has implemented the teaching policy of combining politics and technology, thereby making brilliant achievements in "running the school thriftily and diligently." Especially during the rectification movement, students' revolutionary enthusiasm and production internship enthusiasm have been even higher, constantly creating new records. Chen Zhaoyan, an auxiliary worker, changed the production method, and the production efficiency increased by 16 times. Ye Zengbiao, a student in the 811th class of lathe workers, improved the tools, and the production efficiency increased by 6 times. The oil gauge tester, rate-of-climb indicator tester, airspeed indicator tester, and other aviation instruments created by teachers and students have reached international standards. In the spirit of rectification and improvement, the school adjusted the production structure and internship factory to better suit production needs. Students automatically established technical research groups or went to other factories for internships to exchange advanced experiences. They further proposed to trial-produce a new type of rudder screw balancing instrument, and the quality should catch up with the United Kingdom. Trial production of diesel pumps suitable for water conservancy construction in Northwest China, the price should not exceed 1,000 yuan, and the fuel consumption should be about one pound per hour. They have implemented the socialist revolutionary spirit of more, faster, better, more economical, and serving the people into production practice.

Full of confidence, full of energy, decided to realize the self-sufficiency plan one year ahead of schedule.

The original plan of the Xi'an First Aviation Technical School was to achieve self-sufficiency in funding next year after completing the total internship output value of 2.1 million yuan this year. Recently, in the anti-waste movement, the original plan was carefully checked. After repeated discussions and research by everyone, it was found that there was potential to be tapped in all aspects, and specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy were further put forward, reducing the budget for expenditure by more than 700,000 yuan. By using the method of pooling wisdom and efforts, buying quickly, making quickly, and selling quickly, the total commodity output value of the students' half-work and half-study internship factory was increased, and the full-year budget reached 1.8 million yuan. Therefore, the time that is hard to buy with gold was advanced by one year. It was decided that from this year on, the school's funding would be completely self-sufficient. The specific example of the Xi'an First Aviation Technical School shows that what Vice Premier Bo Yibo said in his report is very correct: "In front of the movement, fully rely on the masses and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to complete and overfulfill the plan."

On January 31st, the Xi'an First Aviation Industry Workers' Technical School held a mobilization meeting for all teachers and students to run the school thriftily and diligently, and to whip the horse and speed up. They solemnly read out the telegram to Chairman Mao, announced the plan for 1958, and called on all teachers and students: be thrifty and diligent, carry forward the great spirit of the proletariat's loyalty to the socialist revolution and hard work, and ensure that they will no longer ask the state for a single penny in the future. The school's funding will be completely self-sufficient, and 300 technically skilled workers with socialist consciousness will be trained for the country every year.

    不要国家一文钱　全靠自己办学校
    李敷仁代表谈西安第一航空工业工人技术学校勤俭办校的先进事迹
    我完全同意李先念、薄一波副总理，彭真副委员长及吴玉章主任的报告，完全同意周总理及中央各同志的发言。我想谈一谈西安第一航空工业工人技术学校“勤俭办学校”的先进事例。不妥之处，恳请指教。
    苦干四年，培养了二千二百多又红又专的技术工人，制造了一千多台机器、仪器，为国家创造出二百一十多万元财富。
    西安第一航空技校是一九五三年正式成立的。他们在各级党政的正确领导下，苦干了四年。为国家培养出二千二百八十名又红又专的技术工人。为学校创造出一千多台件机器、仪表和直观教具。有些仪器，在全国来说，还是第一次试制成功的。特别是他们在困难条件下，为国家生产出二百一十多万元财富，从今年起，学校经费全部自给自足。每年为国家培养三百名有社会主义政治觉悟的技术工人。
    各位代表！这个学校的先生学生确实可爱。当我开始写这篇发言稿子时，他们全校师生正在热烈的讨论：“不伸手向国家要一文钱，全靠自己的双手，办好学校”的行动口号。讨论“一九五九年争取实现自给自足的计划”。可是，我的稿子还没有写好，陕西日报送来西安第一航空技校给毛主席的电报，上面说：“敬爱的毛主席！我们满怀激动的心情向您报告，把原计划一九五九年争取实现自给自足的计划，决定在今年就实现”。没有一星期，他们把千金难买的时间提前了一年。他们这种革命干劲从那里来的呢？正如电报中所说：“我们全校师生，几年来在党的教育下，深知国家在进行伟大的社会主义建设时期，每一个钱都应当花在最需要的建设事业上”。这完全可以说明，党中央勤俭建国，勤俭办企业，勤俭办学校，勤俭办一切事业的方针的正确性。
    抓紧政治思想工作使困难条件变成胜利因素。
    西安第一航空技校，是怎样勤俭办学校的？他们的总结上说：“首先是党委抓紧政治思想领导”。原来他们的学校，在初成立时，条件很困难。由于抓紧了政治思想领导，使困难变成取得胜利的因素。第一，拿校舍来说，是国民党遗留下来的集中营的房舍，不但破烂简陋，而且师生每人只占了一点三平方公尺招风漏雨的房间。学校怎样克服了这种困难？三个校长，带头住在一个房间办公、开会和会客。先生学生同甘共苦，叠床架铺，住在一起。没有教室，就自己动手，用油毛毡搭棚，夏天热冬天凉，唱着歌子上讲堂。第二，拿设备来说，开始只有一百一十一台陈旧机器，百分之八十五是皮带车床。有些还是张作霖时期的机器，学生们叫老爷式的机器。至于龙门刨床、牛头刨床、铣床、插床、磨床等等急需的工具，根本无钱购买。怎么办呢？他们就是发挥群众的积极性与创造性，开动脑筋，想窍门，挖掘设备的潜力。枣骝马，梨花枪，自奔前程。师生们四年苦干，创造了六百三十四件直观教具。制成一百多种刀具和工具，用“三班倒，四班轮”的实习办法，先把七部皮带车床，改为电动车床，提高了主要机器的转速。没有平面磨床，便用旧砂轮机改装。没有铣床，就在六角车床上加了一个刀盘代用。没有自来水，就想办法自己挖井，利用旧水泵，旧汽油桶，修了一座水塔。没有高温炉，就用耐火砖砌了一座高温炉，这件创造性的劳动，就为国家节约一万四千多元资金。他们仿制成苏联式万能虎钳，东德式台钻。他们四年苦干，把国民党反共反人民的集中营，变成了为社会主义服务有现代化设备的学校。第三，他们是怎样加强政治思想教育，使学生的积极性和创造性不断的提高？比如学生初到学校，因为出身不同，表现出各种各样的非无产阶级思想意识。学校党总支坚持了中央及部、局的指示，加强政治思想领导，做到经常化。按生产结合实习的原则，调整机构，建立领导制度。按照勤俭办学校的原则，充分挖掘设备潜力，发挥群众的积极性与创造性。为此，党总支特别注意经常深入学生群众，了解思想情况、学习情况。及时进行阶级教育、劳动教育、自我教育等活动。
    学校贯彻执行了政治同技术相结合的方针，学生在生产实习中本着多、快、好、省的精神创造出多种仪器和机器。
    西安第一航空技校，四年来贯彻执行了政治与技术相结合的教学方针，从而做出“勤俭办学校”的光辉成绩。特别是在整风运动中，学生的革命干劲、生产实习热潮更加高涨，不断的创造新纪录。辅助工陈兆燕改变生产方法，生产效率提高了十六倍。车工八一一班学生叶增标，改良了刀具，生产效率提高了六倍。师生们创造的油量仪表试验器、升速表试验器、空速表试验器等航空仪器，已达国际水平。学校本着整改精神，调整生产结构和实习工厂，以便更加适合生产需要。学生们自动的成立技术研究小组，或到外厂实习，交换先进经验。进一步提出试制新型舵螺平衡仪，质量要赶上英国。试制适合西北地区兴修水利用的柴油抽水机，价格不超过千元，耗油量约一磅时左右。他们把多、快、好、省，为人民服务的社会主义革命精神贯彻执行到生产实习中去了。
    满怀信心，鼓足干劲，决定提前一年实现自给自足计划。
    西安第一航空技校，原订计划今年实习总产值二百一十万元完成后，明年即可达到经费自给。最近在反浪费运动中，精打细算的检查了原订的计划。经过大家反复讨论研究，发现各方面都有潜力可挖，进一步提出了增产节约的具体计划，减少了经费开支预算七十多万元。用群策群力、快买、快制、快卖的办法，提高了学生半工半读实习工厂的商品总产值，其全年预算达到一百八十万元。因而把“寸金难买寸光阴”的时间提前了一年。决定从今年起，学校经费完全自给。西安第一航空技校这一具体事例，可以说明薄一波副总理报告中所说的：“在运动前面，充分依靠群众，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，来完成和超额完成计划”是十分正确的真理。
    西安第一航空工业工人技术学校，一月三十一日，召开了全校师生勤俭办学、快马加鞭的誓师大会。庄严的宣读了致毛主席的电报，宣布了一九五八年的计划，号召全校师生：克俭克勤，发扬无产阶级忠于社会主义革命，艰苦奋斗的伟大精神，保证今后不再向国家要一文钱，学校经费完全自给，每年为国家培养出三百名有社会主义觉悟的技术工人。
