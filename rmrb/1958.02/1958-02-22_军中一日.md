    A Day in the Military
    By Our Correspondent Dai Feng

    A Fierce Battle

    One bright morning, rare in deep winter, we arrived near the garrison of the Guards Tank Division. The foothills of the snow-covered mountains here were immersed in a biting silence. Suddenly, a deafening roar of artillery and the sound of tank treads mingled together, breaking the silence, and clouds of smoke billowed towards the valley. At this time, various types of powerful tanks hidden in the forest roared across the hills towards the "target." In a flash, they disappeared into the distance and were no longer visible. Deep tracks left by the treads were imprinted on the thick snow...

    This was a field exercise being conducted by a unit of the Tank Division. In these days of peace, Soviet soldiers, regardless of day or night, cold or heat, are diligently studying new combat techniques to defend the motherland and protect peace. This Tank Division established immortal feats in the Great Patriotic War, from the defense of Stalingrad to the liberation of Prague and the capture of Berlin. This Tank Division was always at the forefront of the battle, winning unparalleled glory for the motherland.

    The live-fire exercise continued.

    Soviet Hero, Lieutenant Colonel Shanochiyev of the Guards Tank Division, stood on a snow-covered mound. He occasionally raised his binoculars to observe the changes on the "battlefield." He was the commander of the exercise.

    The powerful tank force advanced at high speed. Not far ahead was the "enemy's" first line of defense. The "enemy's" anti-tank fire was concentrated here. For the tanks charging forward, this was the first dangerous obstacle. The tank crews drove forward at high speed while accurately firing at the "enemy," destroying the "enemy's" firepower, clearing the way for themselves and for the infantry.

    The First Tank Company, commanded by Captain Alexander Ovchimanov of the Guards Tank Division, demonstrated amazing courage and skill in breaking through the "enemy's" first line in "battle," overcoming many difficulties and destroying all the "enemy's" firepower strongholds.

    The "enemy's" first line collapsed. Giant tanks flattened the "enemy's" fortifications at various breakthrough points, deeply penetrated the enemy's position, pursued the "enemy," and expanded the victory.

    The tanks encountered greater difficulties here. The "enemy's" second line of forward positions was a series of steep cliff fortifications. The tank crews had to quickly change the direction and speed of the tanks, charge up the cliffs, and prevent themselves from "somersaulting." However, none of this could stop the tank crews. The first tank to charge up the cliff was commanded by Guards Sergeant Saikhtarob.

    The "enemy" continued to retreat. Suddenly, the radio issued an alert: "Atomic explosion alert." This indicated that the tanks were about to enter the atomic explosion zone. The tank crews immediately put on protective clothing and carried out other necessary operations in the shortest possible time. This type of combat operation can only be completed with highly skilled techniques. The tank crews cleared the effects of the atomic explosion and continued to advance, plunging straight into the "enemy's" heartland, completely eliminating the enemy.

    This was a real battle.

    An Immortal Hero

    After visiting the field exercise, we visited the soldiers' dormitory. First, we arrived at the "First Soldier Collective Dormitory." As soon as we entered, we saw a bed placed separately near the door, with a snow-white quilt neatly folded on the bed. A pot of evergreen was placed on the bedside cabinet, and a half-length oil painting was hanging in the center of the wall. This was a young soldier wearing a tanker's helmet. We all quietly stared at him.

    This painting took us back to a glorious battle in which the Guards Tank Division participated. At that time, it was in the village of Schebiduvga in Poland, and the forward positions of the Hitlerite German troops had been destroyed. The infantry was leaping forward. Suddenly, a dense barrage of machine-gun bullets spewed out from the enemy's pillbox on the right flank. The infantry brothers fell and could not advance. At this moment, a tanker who had left his tank quickly pounced on the pillbox and used his chest to block the enemy's gun muzzle. This was Sergeant Banshekhov of the Guards Tank Division. He opened the way forward with his life. He was the second Matrosov-style Soviet hero.

    Now we stood in front of his bed, paying tribute to this Soviet hero. The regiment headquarters has reserved a bed for him in memory of this heroic soldier. Banshekhov lives forever among the soldiers and forever in the hearts of the Soviet people.

    The Growth of Steel Soldiers

    Next, accompanied by Major Maklakov and Captain Pavlovich of the division headquarters, we visited the Tank Division's academic classrooms and various tank technology specialist rooms.

    The officers in charge of teaching told us that the soldiers' academic performance was very good. After only one year of enlistment, they basically mastered the theoretical principles and practical application of weapons. One of the reasons is that the soldiers are all graduates of tenth and seventh grade middle schools, possessing a certain level of knowledge and a tenacious spirit of learning.

    I walked to the first desk in the middle row of the classroom. I saw that the notes of Alyanov, a new recruit who had only been enlisted for a year, were very neatly taken. I asked him if he had any difficulties in his studies.

    He said loudly: "There are difficulties. It is not without difficulties to master the latest technology, but we have overcome them."

    We then came to the engine specialty room, where many "dissected" various tank engines were placed, making it very clear at a glance how the machines work, how to operate them... Captain Pavlovich told me that almost all the teaching equipment was made by the soldiers themselves, which shows the soldiers' diligence and thrift, and also shows how skillful they are.

    The Soviet army is not only a powerful combat training school but also an excellent political education school. This tank division attaches great importance to the political and ideological education of its soldiers. Political classes are the most important method for conducting political education and comprehensively improving the political level of soldiers.

    Night slowly fell, and we returned to the division headquarters. At the entrance of the division headquarters, we met Trosikov, the deputy division commander and director of the political department of the Guards Tank Division, who had just returned from skiing.

    "How was your impression?" He asked us with a smile as he accompanied us into his office.

    Trosikov is a veteran soldier who has been tempered for a long time. His hair is slightly gray, his forehead is high, and his movements are agile. In his deep-set eye sockets, a pair of gray eyes showed amiability and vigor.

    He talked to me in detail about many interesting things about the history of the division and about the latest tanks. He painted a picture for us of the development and strength of the Soviet army.

    "Our soldiers are all deeply aware of their sacred responsibility: to defend the motherland and defend peace." Trosikov continued: "It is very important to master new technologies. Whether it is windy, rainy, day or night, we conduct exercises and study. Because the invaders may not choose a sunny day to fight..."

    It was late at night, and the surroundings were pitch black. We left the division headquarters. At this time, the buildings of the garrison were brightly lit, and the sounds of pleasant piano music came from the club. The soldiers were singing to the accompaniment of accordions, loud and cheerful.

    军中一日
    本报记者　戴枫
    一场激烈的战斗
    一个深冬里少有的晴朗的早晨，我们来到了近卫军坦克师的驻地附近。这里一片雪原的山麓浸沉在凛冽的寂静里。突然，一阵震耳的炮声和坦克履带转动声混杂在一起，打破了寂静，团团的炮烟，向山谷卷去。这时，隐蔽在林中的威力强大的各式坦克声势浩大地横过山岗，向“目标”疾驶而去。一忽儿，它们就隐没在远处，再也见不到了。厚厚的雪地上留着深深的履带辗压的痕迹……。
    这是坦克师某部在进行野外演习。在和平的日子里，苏军战士们也不分昼夜、不顾严寒或酷热，为了掌握新的战斗技术，为了保卫祖国、保卫和平而努力学习着。这个坦克师在卫国战争中树立了不朽的功勋，从斯大林格勒保卫战，直到解放布拉格、攻克柏林，这个坦克师一直在战斗的最前线，为祖国赢得了无比的荣誉。
    实战演习在继续着。
    苏联英雄、近卫军坦克师中校沙诺契夫站立在皑皑白雪复盖着的土岗上。他不时地拿起双筒望远镜注视着“战场”上的变化。他是演习的指挥员。
    强大的坦克队伍高速度地前进着。前面不远就是“敌人”的第一线阵地。“敌人”反坦克的炮火集中在这里。对于冲锋陷阵的坦克，这是第一道危险的阻力。坦克手们一面高速驱车前进，一面准确地射击“敌人”，摧毁“敌人”火力，为自己也为步兵部队扫清道路。
    近卫军坦克师上尉亚历山大·奥甫契曼夫指挥的第一坦克连在冲破“敌人”第一线的“战斗”中表现了惊人的勇敢和技巧，克服了许多困难，摧毁了所有的“敌人”火力据点。
    “敌人”第一线崩溃了。巨型坦克在各个突破口压平了“敌人”的工事，纵深插入敌人阵地，追击“敌人”，扩大战果。
    坦克在这里遇到了更大的困难。“敌人”的第二线前沿阵地是一堵堵险峻的峭壁工事。坦克手们必须迅速变换坦克前进的方向和速度，冲上峭壁，而又要防止自己“翻跟斗”。但是，这些都难为不住坦克手们。第一辆冲上峭壁的坦克是近卫军下士萨依赫塔罗布所指挥的。
    “敌人”继续后退着。突然，无线电发出了警报：“原子爆炸警报”。这表明坦克马上就要进入原子爆炸区了。坦克手们立即穿起防御衣，并且用最短时间进行其他必须的操作。这种战斗行动只有在高度熟练的技术下才能完成。坦克手们清除了原子爆炸影响，继续前进，直插到“敌人”的心窠，彻底消灭了敌人。
    这是一场真正的战斗。
    一个永生的英雄
    参观了野外演习，我们又去访问战士的宿舍。首先到达的是“第一战士集体寝室”。我们一进门首先看到的是在靠近门边单独放着的一个床位，床上雪白的被褥叠得很整齐。床头立柜上面放着一盆万年青，墙正中悬挂着一幅半身油画像。这是一位头戴坦克手保护帽的年青战士。我们都静静地凝视着他。
    这幅画像把我们带到了近卫军坦克师参加过的一次光荣的战役。那时是在波兰的雪比都夫加村，希特勒德国部队的前沿阵地已经被摧毁了。步兵正在向前跃进。突然敌人右翼阵地的暗堡里射出了密集的机枪子弹，步兵兄弟倒下去了，不能推进。这时，一个离开坦克的坦克手，迅速地扑上暗堡，用胸膛堵住了敌人枪口，这就是近卫军坦克师的中士班雪赫诺夫，他用生命开辟了前进的道路。他是第二个马特洛索夫式的苏联英雄。
    现在我们站立在他的床前，向这位苏联英雄致意。团部为了纪念这位英勇战士，为他保留着床位。班雪赫诺夫永远活
    在战士们中间，永远活在苏联人民的心里。
    钢铁战士的成长
    接着，我们在师部少校马克拉科夫和大尉巴甫洛维奇陪同下参观了坦克师学科教室和各个坦克技术专修室。
    负责教课的军官告诉我们：战士们的学习成绩非常好，入伍一年，基本上就掌握了武器理论原理和实践运用。原因之一，是战士们都是十年级和七年级的中学毕业生，具有一定的知识水平，而且有着顽强的学习精神。
    我走到教室中间一排第一个课桌前。我看到刚入伍一年的新战士阿列雅诺夫的笔记记得非常整齐，我问他学习有什么困难。
    他大声说：“困难是有的，掌握最新的技术不会没有困难，但我们是克服了。”
    我们又来到了发动机专业室，这里放着许多“解剖”了的各式坦克发动机，使你一看就非常清楚：机器是怎样转动的，怎样操作的……。大尉巴甫洛维奇告诉我：差不多所有教学器材都是战士们亲手做的，这说明了战士们的勤俭节约，还说明了他们有一双多么灵巧的手。
    苏军不仅是一个强大的战斗训练学校，而且是一个优秀的政治教育学校。这个坦克师很重视对战士们的政治思想教育。政治课是对军人们进行政治教育和全面提高他们政治水平的最重要的方法。
    夜幕缓缓降落，我们回到了师部。在师部门口遇见了近卫军坦克师副师长、政治部主任特罗西科夫，他刚刚滑雪回来。
    “印象怎样？”他一面笑着问我们，一面陪着我们走进了他的办公室。
    特罗西科夫是一位久经锻炼的老战士了。他头发稍有灰白，高额，动作敏捷。深凹的眼眶里一对灰色眼珠，显出和蔼而又精力充沛。
    他详细地跟我谈起许多有趣的关于师的历史，谈到了最新的坦克，他给我们描绘出一幅苏联军队发展和强大的图画。
    “我们的战士都深知自己神圣的责任：保卫祖国，保卫和平。”特罗西科夫接着说：“掌握新技术是很重要的。不管风里、雨里、白天、黑夜，我们都进行演习，学习。因为侵略者不一定挑选大晴天才打仗的啊……。”
    夜深了，四周是一片漆黑。我们离开了师部。这时，驻地的建筑物灯光通明，俱乐部里传出了阵阵悦耳的琴声。战士们和着手风琴在歌唱，高亢而愉快。
