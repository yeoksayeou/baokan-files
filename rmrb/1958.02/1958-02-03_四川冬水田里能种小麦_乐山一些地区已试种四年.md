　　Wheat Can Be Grown in Winter Paddy Fields in Sichuan
    Trial Plantings in Some Areas of Leshan Have Been Successful for Four Years
    (Our report) Cadres and farmers in Fuxi, Maoqiao, and Lingyun townships of Leshan County, Sichuan Province, have successfully experimented with planting wheat in winter paddy fields using the "Nanda 2419" improved variety from 1952 to 1956. Du Shaoyang, a member of the Nongle Cooperative's Team Two in Lingyun Township, harvested twenty jin of wheat from 0.16 mu of winter paddy field, averaging 125 jin per mu. The yield of other winter paddy fields was over 120 jin per mu. The successful trial planting of wheat in winter paddy fields has opened up new avenues for the full utilization of winter paddy fields. Local agricultural departments have preliminarily summarized this experience and are preparing to promote it throughout the county.
    Wheat planted in this way not only did not show signs of seed rotting or seedling death, but also had strong disease resistance and no pests or diseases were found.

　　四川冬水田里能种小麦
    乐山一些地区已试种四年
    本报讯　四川省乐山县符溪、茅桥和凌云等乡的干部和农民，用“南大二四一九”良种，先后于1952—1956年在冬水田里试验种植的小麦都已成功。凌云乡农乐社二队社员杜绍阳曾在一分六厘冬水田里收了小麦二十斤，平均亩产一百二十五斤。其余的冬水田小麦亩产都在一百二十斤以上。冬水田里试种小麦成功，为充分利用冬水田开辟了新的道路。当地农业部门已初步总结了这个经验，准备在全县范围内推广。
    这样种植的小麦，不仅没有发现烂种和死苗的现象，而且抗病力强，没有发现病虫害。
