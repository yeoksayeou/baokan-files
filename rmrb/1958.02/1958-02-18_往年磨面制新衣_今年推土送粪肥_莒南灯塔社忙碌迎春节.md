Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th (Reporter Cao Xuepu): Before the Spring Festival, this reporter visited the Lighthouse Agricultural Cooperative in Ju'nan County, an old revolutionary base area in Shandong Province, and saw many scenes of welcoming the Spring Festival by breaking with convention.

Currently, it is the coldest time of winter, yet crowds of people breaking rocks and smashing stones still fill the entire mountain pond; carts pushing earth and delivering manure shuttle back and forth from morning till night. In past years, the days before the Spring Festival were the busiest time for women grinding rice and flour and rushing to make new clothes, but this year these activities have been replaced by sideline occupations and clearing out fertilizer, among other activities. In just the last ten days or so, the entire cooperative has accumulated more than 1,500 cartloads of high-quality soil fertilizer. Nine types of household sideline occupations, such as textile work and embroidery, have also generated nearly 7,000 yuan in cash income.

Frugality in managing household affairs is also prominent here. The Wang Zidong family, with their many descendants totaling eleven people, is a surplus grain household. In past years, they always bought more than ten catties of pork and ground seventy or eighty catties of white flour for the Spring Festival, and adults and children alike had new clothes made. This year, the family held a family meeting and decided to buy only three catties of meat, a fish weighing just over a catty, grind thirty catties of wheat, and not make any new clothes. Shen Quan, the township party branch secretary, told me that this Spring Festival the entire cooperative can save 35,000 catties of wheat and 4,000 catties of pork compared to last year, but every household will still be able to eat white flour dumplings for more than three meals and two or three catties of meat.

This year, over twenty young couples in the cooperative are getting married. In the past, weddings here required each family to prepare gifts and entertain guests, costing more than a hundred yuan. This year, based on the spirit of both frugality and liveliness, it is estimated that the entire cooperative can save more than 2,000 yuan on this item alone.

The Lighthouse Cooperative is an old revolutionary base area. Production has been continuously improving in recent years, and every family is richer than before. Since October of last year, the cooperative has been educating members through meetings of models of frugal household management and life exhibitions, using examples of the arduous struggles of the military and civilians in the old base area to guide them to think about the past, look at the present, and consider the future, so that members deeply understand the meaning of frugal household management. As a result, a situation has emerged throughout the cooperative where everyone works diligently and everything emphasizes thrift. Now, the cooperative's short-term production plan for after the Spring Festival has already been made. They have decided to break with convention, muster their energy, and organize a production shock brigade to go to work in the fields on the first day of the Lunar New Year, and to start working comprehensively on the second day.

### 往年磨面制新衣　今年推土送粪肥  莒南灯塔社忙碌迎春节

    往年磨面制新衣　今年推土送粪肥
    莒南灯塔社忙碌迎春节
    新华社济南17日电　新华社记者曹学璞报道：春节前，记者到山东省老革命根据地莒南县的灯塔农业社访问，看到了许多打破常规迎春节的景象。
    当前正是数九寒天，而开石头、砸石子的人群依然布满整个山塘；推土送粪的小车从早到晚往返不停。往年，春节前是妇女们碾米磨面、赶制新衣最忙碌的日子，今年却被副业和清扫积肥等活动代替了。仅最近十多天的光景，全社就积了一千五百多车质量很好的土肥。纺织、绣花等九种家庭副业也收入了近七千元现金。
    勤俭持家方面，这里也很突出。子孙满堂的王子东家共十一口人，是个余粮户，往年春节总是买十多斤猪肉，磨七、八十斤白面，大人孩子都要添制新衣服。今年他家开了个家庭会议，确定只买三斤肉，一斤多重的一尾鱼，磨三十斤小麦，不添新衣了。乡支部书记沈泉告诉我：今年春节全社可以比去年节省三万五千斤小麦和四千斤猪肉，但是每户都能吃上三顿以上的白面水饺和两三斤肉。
    今年春节社里有二十多对青年男女结婚。往年这里结婚，每家备礼请客得花百元以上，今年本着既节约又活泼的精神，就这一项，估计全社就可以节省两千多元。
    灯塔社是老革命根据地，这几年生产不断提高，家家较前富裕了，社里从去年10月份开始就通过召开勤俭持家模范会、生活展览会，以老根据地军民艰苦奋斗的实例，引导社员想过去、看现在、顾将来，向社员进行教育，使社员深深明白勤俭持家的意义。因而在全社出现了人人勤劳动，事事讲节约的局面。现在这个社春节后的小段生产计划已经作出，他们决定打破常规，鼓起干劲，大年初一就组织一个生产突击队下地劳动，初二就全面下地干活。
