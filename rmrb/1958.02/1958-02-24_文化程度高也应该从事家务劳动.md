    High Cultural Level Should Also Engage in Household Labor
    I am a housewife with four children. I once attended university and worked as an accountant in a factory. According to Qian Miaoying's view, I also have a certain level of education and work ability. There was a time when I saw female comrades going to work one after another, shouldering the great task of building socialism together with male comrades. My thoughts also fluctuated: why can't I be like them but "willingly die in the kitchen"? I discussed this with my lover many times. After careful consideration, especially after I participated in street work, my thoughts began to clear.
    From an economic point of view, female workers with many children are better off doing housework than working. Because if you work, there will be no one to take care of the children, and you must hire a nanny. Now the salary of nannies in Beijing is generally around 20 yuan (a nanny who takes care of four children may not be willing to work for 20 yuan), plus food, it costs about 30 yuan; other expenses will also increase accordingly. For example, if you work, in addition to increasing some travel expenses and pocket money, the children's clothes have to be taken to the sewing cooperative due to time constraints, which will cost at least about 10 yuan a month. I don't have a breastfeeding child, otherwise the expenses would be even greater.
    From the perspective of child-rearing, working may also cause certain losses to the health and character of children due to lack of care. The way Qian Miaoying's eldest child eats, sometimes cold and sometimes hot, is obviously detrimental to the health of the stomach. There is a child near my house, because both parents work and usually neglect his education, he gradually develops the bad habit of stealing.
    Finally, I believe that people who are willing to contribute to socialist construction are not afraid of having no future. Although I am engaged in household labor now, I also have a share in the construction of socialism. This is not only because housework is a part of social labor, but also because I am engaged in household labor at home, so I have the opportunity to participate in street work. The vigorous movement to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eliminate illiteracy are all carried out by our neighborhood committee in cooperation with all residents under the leadership of the Party and the government. In addition, which of the grain work, security work, propaganda work, election work, and welfare work is not related to socialist construction? As long as we are willing to contribute, there is no place to use our strength?
    Therefore, whether from the perspective of family economy, child-rearing, saving national expenses, or one's own contribution and future to society, it is better for female workers with many children to retire and return home to engage in household labor than to stay at work reluctantly. Some comrades look down on housework, as if housewives are ignorant and ignorant, and "housewives" have become synonymous with backward women. In fact, people who hold this view can only show that she (or he) is lagging behind objective reality. Housewives under the leadership and education of the Party have long turned from the parasitic life before liberation to a member of socialist construction who actively contributes.

### 文化程度高也应该从事家务劳动

    文化程度高也应该从事家务劳动
    我是一个家庭妇女，有四个孩子。我曾经上过大学，并在一个工厂里做过会计工作。按照钱妙英的说法，我也有一定的文化水平和工作能力。有一个时期我看到妇女同志都纷纷走上了工作岗位，和男同志一起肩负了建设社会主义的伟大任务，我的思想也一度波动：为什么我不能和她们一样却“甘心老死在厨房”呢？为了这事，我和爱人讨论过多次，后来经过仔细考虑，特别是当我参加了街道工作以后，我的思想才开始明朗。
    从经济上来考虑，子女多的女职工做工作还不如从事家务劳动。因为自己做了工作，小孩就没人照顾，必需请一个保姆，现在北京保姆的工资一般在二十元上下（照顾四个孩子的保姆，二十元的报酬还未必肯干），加上伙食约需三十元；其他的开支也要相应增加。例如自己做了工作，除了要增加一些车钱和零用外，孩子的衣服由于时间关系不得不拿到缝纫社去做，总共算来一个月也至少要十元左右。我还没有吃奶的孩子，否则开支就会更大。
    从对孩子的教养来考虑，做了工作也会由于照顾不到可能使孩子的健康和品德受到一定的损失。钱妙英同志的大孩子，那种冷一顿热一顿的吃法显然对胃的健康是不利的。我家附近有一个孩子，由于父母都做工作，平常也忽视对他的教育，就逐渐养成偷窃的坏习惯。
    最后我认为愿意为社会主义建设贡献力量的人不怕没有前途。我现在虽然从事家务劳动，但社会主义的建设也有我的一分力量。这不仅因为家务劳动是社会劳动的一部分，同时由于我在家从事家务劳动因而有可能参加了街道工作。现在轰轰烈烈的除四害、讲卫生运动和扫除文盲等工作，都是我们居民委员会在党和政府的领导下协同全体居民进行的。此外还有粮食工作、治安工作、宣传工作、选举工作、福利工作等等哪一样不是与社会主义建设有关？只要我们愿意贡献力量哪怕没处去使？
    因此，无论就家庭经济、孩子教养、节约国家开支以及自己对社会的贡献和前途来看，子女多的女职工，勉强留在工作岗位上都不如退职回家从事家务劳动的好。有些同志看不起家务劳动，好像家庭妇女就是愚昧无知的，“家庭妇女”成了落后妇女的代名词。其实持有这种见解的人只能说明她（或他）自己落后于客观现实，在党领导与教育下的家庭妇女，早已从解放前的寄生生活转向社会主义建设中积极贡献力量的一分子了。
