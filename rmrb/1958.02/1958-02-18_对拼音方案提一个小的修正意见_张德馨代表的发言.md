I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and I suggest that the Congress adopt the 1958 national budget, the national economic plan, and the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme after it has been discussed and possibly revised.

I would now like to express some opinions on the new Hanyu Pinyin Scheme. First of all, it should be affirmed that this scheme is indeed more complete than any historical pinyin scheme. This is undeniable. This is the result of the hard work of many people, extensive discussions, and repeated deliberations and revisions by the government. Therefore, I express my infinite respect to all those who participated in the research and discussion of the pinyin scheme. I warmly support the responsible and prudent attitude taken by the government in formulating the pinyin scheme. I firmly oppose the shameless slanders of the rightists, who say that the pinyin scheme was created by a small number of people behind closed doors.

The new pinyin scheme does have many advantages. However, I think that a small amendment could be made as follows:

In the scheme, there are twenty-one initials, six simple finals, thirteen compound finals, and sixteen finals with medial vowels, for a total of thirty-five finals. From the "Common Character Pinyin Chart," it can be seen that in order to spell Mandarin based on Beijing pronunciation, it is not necessary to combine every initial with every final. The maximum number of initials that can be combined with the same final is eighteen. For example, the initials that can be combined with an, ang, eng, and u are all eighteen. The minimum number of initials that can be combined with the same final is three. For example, the number of initials that can be combined with üan, ün, and iong is three each.

In the scheme, only the four initials b, p, m, and f can be combined with o alone, and the resulting bo, po, mo, and fo represent the sounds of the four characters 波, 坡, 模, and 佛 respectively. It is found that there are eighteen initials that can be combined with the simple final u alone, sixteen initials that can be combined with a alone, fifteen initials that can be combined with e alone, and seventeen initials that can be combined with i alone, including the i that should be added after zh, ch, sh, r, z, c, and s when spelling "知、蚩、诗、日、资、雌、思". There are also five initials that can be combined with ü alone. Only the important letter o can be combined with only four initials. Is this arrangement too underutilizing this letter? I think it is worth studying.

According to Russian, German, English and other languages, except for variations in reading, the letter o is used to represent the sound "Ou", which is the phonetic symbol “ㄡ”. For example, Russian От, Он, Дом, Пол, Около, etc.; German wo, so, rot, lob, oft, etc.; English no, go, old, open, most, etc. Why don't we use o to represent the sound "Ou", but instead use o to represent the sound "O", which is the phonetic symbol “ㄛ”, and use ou to represent the sound "Ou"? Isn't this too un-internationalized?

In the scheme, there are sixteen initials that can be combined with ou. If o is used to replace ou, then the number of initials that can be combined with o alone will change from four to sixteen, which will greatly shorten the character form. Moreover, the final iou can also be rewritten as io. In this way, "牛" can be written as nio, instead of being simplified from niou to niu. There are also six initials that can be combined with io. Combining them with the previous sixteen, plus o and io themselves, is equal to twenty-four kinds of differently pronounced characters that have their forms shortened. This number accounts for about six percent of the total number of differently pronounced characters, which is about four hundred. Isn't this a great saving! At the same time, in this way, the thirteen compound finals in the scheme become twelve, which is also a saving.

Saving is certainly a good thing. But the reason I propose the amendment is not only for saving, and mainly not for saving. The main reason is: it is not necessary to spell 波、坡、模、佛 as bo, po, mo, fo. Then how should they be spelled? I think these four characters can be spelled as be, pe, me, fe. I have asked many people: What is the difference in finals between the four characters 波、坡、模、佛 and the four characters 德、特、哥、可? They all can't tell. Only the comrades who promote the pinyin scheme say that there is a difference. I asked them to pronounce them for me, but I couldn't hear any difference. Then some comrades enlightened me by saying that the mouth shapes are slightly different, and that the mouth shapes are more rounded when reading 波、坡、模、佛. I tried reading them repeatedly, and I also felt that there seemed to be a slight difference. But I think that the reason for the difference is because the four initials b, p, m, and f are labial letters. Therefore, when they are spelled together with e, they naturally produce different mouth shapes from de, te, ge, and ke.

Should the spelling be different just because the mouth shapes are different? I think, not necessarily. If people who speak Beijing Mandarin really think that be, pe, me, fe cannot represent 波、坡、模、佛, I think we might as well write these four characters as be, pe, me, fe, but read them as bo, po, mo, fo in the scheme. This is a variation in reading. There are also variations in reading in other languages. Like in Russian and German, basically one letter represents one phoneme. But sometimes there are also variations in reading. In Russian, the o before a stressed syllable is read as a, such as окно. In German, vowels before two consonants are read as short vowels, such as kommen. As for each vowel in English, there are several ways to read it.

If 波、坡、模、佛 are spelled as be, pe, me, fe, then the number of initials that can be combined with e alone will not be fifteen, but eighteen, because there are three original positions that are empty. This further expands the usage rate of the single final e. At the same time, uo in the scheme should also be written as ue, so that the scheme can be uniformly adjusted. After the adjustment, the scheme greatly expands the function of the letters o and e, shortens the forms of twenty-four characters, and reduces one compound final.

After the scheme is adjusted, there are eighteen initials each that can be combined with u and e alone, sixteen initials each that can be combined with a and o alone, seventeen initials that can be combined with i alone, and five initials that can be combined with ü alone. I think this arrangement seems more reasonable. However, I must state that I am not a researcher of linguistics. Therefore, my opinion may not be correct. Since we are going to discuss it, I will bring it up. If there is anything inappropriate, I would like everyone to correct me.

### 对拼音方案提一个小的修正意见  张德馨代表的发言

    对拼音方案提一个小的修正意见
    张德馨代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告，并建议大会通过一九五八年的国家预算、国民经济计划和经过讨论后可能再有所修改的汉语拼音方案。
    我现在就新的汉语拼音方案发表一点意见。首先应该肯定的是：这个方案比起历史上任何拼音方案，确实更加完善。这一点是谁也不能否认的。这是许多人士努力研究、广泛讨论和政府反复审议、多次修订的结果。所以我对一切参加研究讨论拼音方案的人士表示无限的敬意。我热烈拥护政府对制订拼音方案采取了负责和慎重的态度。我坚决反对右派分子的无耻谰言，说什么拼音方案是少数人关起门来搞的。
    新的拼音方案确实优点很多。但我认为，似乎还可以作一个小的修正如下：
    在方案中有二十一个声母，六个单韵母，十三个复合韵母，十六个带声韵母，共为三十五个韵母。从“常用字拼音表挂图”可以看出，为了拼写以北京语音为标准的普通话，并不用使每一个声母同每一个韵母拼写在一起。能同一个韵母拼写的声母最多有十八个。比方能同an，ang，eng，u拼写的声母都是十八个。能同一个韵母拼写的声母最少有三个。比方能同üan，ün，iong拼写的各有三个声母。
    在方案中能单独与o拼写的只有b、p、m、f这四个声母，而拼写出来的bo、po、mo、fo分别表示波、坡、模、佛这四个字的音。查能单独与单韵母u拼写的声母有十八个，能单独与a拼写的声母有十六个，能单独与e拼写的声母有十五个，能单独与i拼写的声母有十七个，包括拼写“知、蚩、诗、日、资、雌、思”时在zh，ch，sh，r，z ，c，s后边应该加的i，就是单独与ü拼写的声母也有五个。惟独o这个重要的字母只有四个声母可以与它单独拼写，这种安排是否太屈用了这个字母，我认为值得研究。
    查俄、德、英等文字，除变读外，都用o 这个字母表示字音“欧”，就是注音字母“ㄡ”。比方俄文的ОТ，ОН，ДОМ，ПОЛ，ОКОЛО，等等；德文的wo，so，rot，lob，oft，等等；英文的no，go，old，open，most等等。为什么我们不用o表示字音“欧”，偏用o表示字音“喔”，就是注音字母“ㄛ”，而用ou表示“欧”这个音呢？这是不是太不国际化了呢？
    方案中能与ou拼写的声母有十六个。若用o代替ou，则能单独与o拼写的声母将由四个变成十六个，这将大大地缩短字形。并且韵母iou也可以改写成io，如此“牛”可以写成nio，不必从niou简写成niu了。能与io拼写的声母又有六个，与前边的十六个合并计算，再加上o与io本身，等于有二十四种发音不同的字缩短了字形，这个数占全体发音不同字数约四百的百分之六。这不是一个大大的节约么！同时这样一来，方案中的十三个复合韵母，就变成十二个了，这也是一个节约。
    节约固然是好事。但我提出修正的理由不单单是为了节约，而且主要的不是为节约。主要的理由是：不必把波、坡、模、佛拼写成bo、po、mo、fo。那么该怎么拼呢？我认为，可以把这四个字拼写成be、pe、me、fe。我曾问过许多人：波、坡、模、佛四个字与德、特、哥、可四个字在韵母上有何不同，都说不出来。只是宣传拼音方案的同志们说有区别。我请他们念给我听，但是我听不出有什么区别来。于是有的同志启发我说，口形有些不同，读出波、坡、模、佛时，口形比较圆一些。我反复试读，也感到似乎有点不同。但我认为，其所以不同的缘故是因为b、p、m、f、这四个声母是唇音字母。因此当它们与e拼读在一起时，自然发出与de、te、ge、ke不同的口形。
    是否口形不同就应该拼写不同呢？我认为，不一定。如果讲北京话的人确实认为be、pe、me、fe表示不了波、坡、模、佛，我认为不妨把这四个字还写成be、pe，me、fe，但读成方案中的bo、po、mo、fo。这是来了一个变读。变读在其它文字中也有。像在俄文和德文里，基本上是一个字母表示一个音素。但有时还有变读。在俄文字里重音节前边的o读a，如окно。在德文字里两个子音前的母音读短音，如kommen。至于英文的每一个母音都有好几种读法。
    如果把波、坡、模、佛拼写成be，pe，me，fe，则能单独与e拼写的声母就不是十五个，而是十八个了，因为原有三个位置是空着的。这又扩大了单韵母e的使用率。同时方案中的uo也应该写作ue，这样就把方案统一调整了。调整后的方案，大大地发挥了字母o、e的作用，缩短了二十四种字形，减少了一个复合韵母。
    方案调整后，能与u、e单独拼写的声母各有十八个，能与a、o单独拼写的声母各有十六个，能与i单独拼写的声母有十七个，能与ü单独拼写的声母有五个。这样安排，我认为似乎比较合理些。不过我必须声明，我并不是研究语言文字学的。所以我的意见不一定正确。既然要讨论嘛，我就把它提出来。不当之处，愿请大家指正。
