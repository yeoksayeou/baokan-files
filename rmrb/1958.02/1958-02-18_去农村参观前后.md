Before and After Visiting the Countryside
Wang Xide, Carding Maintenance Worker, Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill

The leaders said, "Go visit the Jun County agricultural cooperative's water diversion project up the mountain and learn from their enthusiasm." I thought, "Besides using a water pump, how can water go uphill?" The leaders said, "Go visit the Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory's nursery that costs three cents to run and learn from their thrift." I thought, "I spend several yuan just for a Sunday outing, how can three cents run a nursery?" In short, I didn't believe it. After all, I came from the countryside, what's there to see in the countryside!

However, as soon as we arrived in the Jun County countryside, we saw water channels winding around the mountains, seemingly endless, just like the Great Wall. Constructing these waterways required cutting down high ridges, filling in lowlands, and traversing cliff edges, a very arduous undertaking. We went to see the Happiness Canal of the Spark Cooperative, built on the Eagle Cliff, a place where no one had ever ventured before. On the outside was a cliff, and on the inside was a steep wall. Some of our comrades felt dizzy and weak upon ascending, and had to close their eyes and be led by others. These agricultural cooperatives also changed river courses, built reservoirs, and in addition to irrigation, they were already using water to power mills, cotton gins, and waterwheels, and planned to generate electricity in the future. They also drafted a "Five-Year Plan" to transform the sandy beaches into fertile farmland. They worked day and night and completed it in just over thirty days. A large expanse of sandy beach was now covered with lush green wheat seedlings.

We went to visit the Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory's nursery. Originally, it was just a building frame with only a slanting wall and a roof, but the workers only needed the administration to spend three cents on lime and paste to tidy up the building and start the nursery. The cradles and utensils in the nursery were all brought in by the workers themselves. The factory's buildings and dormitories were all old plank houses, there was no dining hall for meals, and the bathhouse was just a shed surrounded by reed mats. The conditions were much worse than ours. But their production enthusiasm was much greater than ours. Even on the way to and from work, they would pick up bamboo sticks discarded after eating lollipops and bring them back to the factory to use as nails, and collect watermelon rinds and vegetable leaves to feed the pigs.

In the past, I always thought, "Farmers are selfish, we workers are still better than farmers, no matter how backward we are." However, we learned in the Star Cooperative that after the cooperative director, Li Dagui, diverted water up the mountain and turned barren land into paddy fields, he needed to add water buffalo and farming tools for transplanting and harvesting rice, so he went to the county to discuss a loan from the bank. Who knew that after the members discussed it, they felt that the state should use the money for more important construction projects. Therefore, they did not agree to take out a loan from the bank, but instead the members lent their dividends to the cooperative to purchase the needed items. Some lent one hundred yuan, others lent eighty yuan, and a demobilized soldier even lent all of his savings of more than four hundred yuan to the cooperative, raising a total of more than two thousand yuan, which solved the problem. My awareness was not as high as the farmers. Last year, when donating winter clothes, I thought that we had donated in previous years, so I didn't donate anything. This time, when we went to the Spark Cooperative, we saw a red list of people who donated winter clothes, with donations ranging from one to five yuan. Our income is much higher than that of the farmers, so why did we donate so much less than them? They even kept saying "Learn from the working class big brothers," which made me feel more and more ashamed. I thought to myself, "I'm not even qualified to be a brother, let alone a big brother!"

In the past, when we gathered together, we liked to talk about who had the highest salary, the best clothes, and the prettiest hairstyle. When our salaries were high, we still wanted them to be higher. I am twenty-four years old this year, and I earn more than fifty yuan a month, with no family burden. In the summer, I wear gabardine, and in the winter, I wear imported wool that costs forty yuan per meter. This time, when I went to the countryside to visit, the leaders told us to dress plainly. I didn't have any cloth clothes, so I had to borrow a large cloth garment from someone else. I also thought it was too much trouble to keep my extra money in the bank, so I kept it in my pocket and spent it recklessly. I also felt that the team leader and technicians were prejudiced against me and had lowered my salary during the wage evaluation, which made me feel unhappy. But this time, when we went to the Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory, we saw that the highest salary was only forty-five yuan, and most were thirty or forty yuan, much lower than ours, but their production was good. Last year, they turned over 25,000 yuan in profits, equivalent to more than twice the factory's total assets. The factory had more than three hundred people, and they dressed very plainly. I also made a plan when I returned, I will not make new clothes for five years, I will remit money to my mother every month, and I will save the extra money in the bank.

The issue of work clothes is the same. In the past, we were issued one set a year, and we would throw them away even if they weren't worn out. I still have the ones issued to me in the past two years that haven't been worn out. Therefore, I guarantee that I will not receive work clothes for five years, and I will mobilize a comrade not to receive them for three years.

Let's talk about work. We learned that when the Spark Cooperative built the Happiness Canal, the technical staff originally designed it to cost 30,000 yuan, which was not enough even if the cooperative used all of its annual income. The members then came up with the idea of using stones instead of steel bars and yellow mud instead of cement, and built the canal for 550 yuan. When the Star No. 4 Cooperative was building the Dongzi Nian Canal, a drill bit fell into a pool of water more than two zhang deep. A drill bit was only worth a little more than one yuan, but Communist Youth League member Zhao Yixuan jumped into the cold water to retrieve it. People are so thrifty and economical, but what about us in the past? We threw tools away casually, and if they were not easy to use, we would get new ones, which was a great waste. This time, we decided to conscientiously save machine materials, and we will clean up usable old materials from the waste material warehouse. If the tools are broken, we will repair them ourselves before using them again, and guarantee that we will not get new tools for six months.

During this trip to the countryside, we also learned that the members go out early and return late, working twelve hours a day, and completing three days' worth of work in two days. What about us in the past? We worked eight hours a day, and if we were late for one hour due to a temporary matter, we would "make up for the rest" the next day, being one hour late. Sometimes we would read newspapers at work when we had nothing to do. When the leaders criticized us, I would argue, "There are also gains from reading newspapers!" Is it really that there is nothing to do? No, the problem is whether you are proactive in looking for things to do. This time, we proposed "Never leave work until the work is finished."

In the past, I had no respect for the veteran workers. When they assigned me work, I didn't like to listen. When the workshop leaders talked to me, I talked more than they did, which made the leaders have a headache. After this visit and study, I thought: To do a good job in production, how can it work without unity? In particular, the veteran workers are non-Party members, and I am still the League group leader, so I should take the initiative to unite with the veteran workers. Recently, veteran worker Chen Zaoting proposed an improvement to the cotton box, so we worked together to make it, which resulted in the uniformity of the first pass cotton lap in the entire workshop dropping from 3% to 1.5%, laying the foundation for improving yarn quality. I recently made a small improvement to the pulley, which is also beneficial to the uniformity of the cotton lap.

Our factory has already put forward the slogan of "Quality Great Leap Forward, running enterprises diligently and thriftily." We are determined and confident to achieve this Great Leap Forward. (Recorded by Cao Baoming)

    去农村参观前后
    武汉国棉一厂清花保全工　王喜德
    领导上说：“去参观均县农业社引水上山，学人家的干劲。”我就想：“除了用抽水机外，水怎么能上山？”领导上说：“去参观襄樊棉织厂三角钱办个托儿所，学人家的勤俭。”我就想：“我星期天玩一趟也得几块钱，三角钱还能办托儿所？”总之，我不相信。因为我也是从农村出来的，农村有什么好参观的！
    但是，我们一到均县农村，就看见水渠都是盘山转，望不到头，就跟万里长城一样。开这些水道要削高岭，填低地，穿崖边，工程非常艰巨。我们去看火花社的幸福渠，它是修在过去没有人迹的老鹰崖上，外面是悬崖，里面是陡壁，我们有些同志一上去就头晕眼花脚发软，只好闭着眼睛让人家牵着走。这些农业社还改河道，修水库，除了灌溉以外，已经用水来推磨、轧花和带动水车，将来还要发电。他们还订了个将沙滩改为良田的“五年计划”。可是他们没日没夜地干，结果三十多天就完成了。一大片沙滩都长着绿油油的麦苗。
    我们去参观襄樊棉织厂的托儿所。这里原来是一座房框子，只有一堵斜墙和一个屋顶，但职工们却只要行政上花了三角钱买石灰、面糊，便将房子收拾好，办起托儿所来了。托儿所里的摇窝和用具，都是工人自己拿出来的。这个工厂的厂房、宿舍都是旧板壁平房，吃饭没个食堂，洗澡只有个芦席围的棚子，条件比我们差得多。但他们的生产劲头比我们大得多，甚至在上下班的路上，也将别人吃完棒糖丢下的竹棍儿拾回厂作钉子，拾西瓜皮、菜叶子回厂喂猪。
    过去，我总认为“农民自私自利，我们工人再落后，也比农民强些。”但是，我们在明星一社却了解到：社主任李大贵因为引水上山将贫地改为水田后，需要添置水牛和插秧割稻的农具，去县里商量好向银行贷款。哪知社员一讨论，却认为应该让国家把钱用到更重要的建设事业上去，不同意向银行贷款，由社员将分红的钱借给社里添置。大家就这个借一百，哪个借八十，有个复员军人还将他存的四百多元复员费全部借给社里，一共凑了两千多元，解决了问题。我的觉悟就没有农民的高。去年捐献寒衣，我认为前几年捐过现在还捐，就含含糊糊地一个钱也没捐。我们这次去火花社，看见人家贴着捐献寒衣的红榜，都是捐一元到五元。我们的收入比农民多得多，为什么捐的比人家少得多呢？人家还口口声声“向工人老大哥学习”，我越听越难过，心里想：“连兄弟都不够格，还老大哥呢！”
    过去，我们聚在一起就爱议论谁的工资大、衣服好和头式漂亮，工资高了还想再高。我今年二十四岁，一月拿五十多元，又没家庭负担。我夏天穿凡立丁、冬天穿四十元一公尺的进口呢，这次下乡参观领导上叫穿朴素点，我没有布衣服，只好临时借了别人一件大布衣。我多余的钱也嫌存在银行麻烦，而放在兜里乱花乱用。我还认为队长、技术员对我有成见，在评工资时将我压低了，心里不大痛快。但我们这次去襄樊棉织厂，见人家最高的工资才四十五元，一般都是三、四十元，比我们低得多，但人家生产好，去年就上交了二万五千元利润，相当于工厂全部财产的两倍多。这个工厂有三百多人，穿著很朴素。我回来也订了个规划，五年不做新衣服，按月汇钱给母亲，多余的钱就存在银行里。
    工作服的问题也是这样。我们过去一年发一件，没穿坏就扔了。我现在还有前年和去年发的没穿破。因此，我保证自己五年不领工作服，并动员一个同志三年不领。
    再谈谈工作问题。我们了解火花社修幸福渠，技术干部原设计要三万元，全社一年的收入全用上也不够，社员们就想法用石头代替钢筋，用黄泥代替水泥，花五百五十元将渠修成。明星四社修洞子埝渠，掉了一把钻子到两丈多深的水潭里，一把钻子不过值一元多钱，但共青团员赵义轩就跳进寒水里去捞。人家这样勤俭节约，我们过去是怎样呢？工具随便扔，不好用就领新的，浪费很大。我们这次就决定认真节约机物料，并到废料仓库清理出能用的旧料来，工具坏了也自己修补好再用，保证六个月不领新工具。
    我们这次在农村还了解到，社员们都是早出晚归每天工作十二小时，两天干完三天的活。我们过去怎样呢？每天上班八小时，如果临时有事迟下班一小时，第二天也要“补休息”，迟到一个钟头。有时在班上没事就看报纸，领导上批评我们，我还强辩：“看报纸也有收获！”真的是没有事做吗？不是的，问题是在你是不是主动去找事。我们这次就提出“没做完工作决不下班。”
    我过去对老师傅很不尊重。他分配我干活，我就不爱听。车间领导上找我谈话，我说的话比他们还多，闹的领导上很头疼。这次参观学习后，我想：要搞好生产，不团结还行？特别是老师傅是非党员，而我还是团小组长，更应该主动团结老师傅。最近，老师傅陈早庭提出改进出棉箱的建议，我们就大伙动手作，结果使全车间的头道棉卷均匀度由3％降为1.5％，为提高纱支质量打下了基础。我最近对皮带盘做了点小改进，对棉卷均匀度也有好处。
    我们工厂已经提出了“质量大跃进，勤俭办企业”的跃进口号，我们有决心有信心实现这个大跃进。　（曹葆铭记）
