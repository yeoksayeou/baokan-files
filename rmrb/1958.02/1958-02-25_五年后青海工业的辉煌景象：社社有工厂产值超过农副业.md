Xinhua News Agency, Xining, February 24th. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the total value of Qinghai Province's local industrial output will surpass the total value of agricultural and sideline production. This is the industrial leap forward plan recently formulated by Qinghai Province.

Qinghai Province has a very weak local industrial base. By the end of 1957, the total value of local industrial output had increased 28-fold compared to 1952. However, compared to agriculture, it was still far behind, accounting for only 22.76% of the province's total industrial and agricultural output value. In order to catch up with agricultural development as quickly as possible, during the Second Five-Year Plan, the province will adhere to the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift, making use of existing conditions, relying on the strength of the masses, and vigorously developing industries such as fertilizers, coal, chemicals, textiles, and food. By 1962, the total value of local industrial output in the province will account for 54.7% of the total industrial and agricultural output value.

In the next five years, Qinghai Province will build more than 2,100 large, medium, and small fertilizer plants. The fertilizer produced by these plants can meet the needs of 4 million mu of farmland. The production and repair of agricultural and pastoral machinery will also develop rapidly. In addition to appropriately expanding the larger Xining Agricultural and Pastoral Machinery Plant in the province, each autonomous prefecture and agricultural county will build medium-sized iron factories to manufacture and repair small agricultural and pastoral machinery. Each agricultural commune will also set up a large number of iron and wood agricultural and pastoral machinery repair factories. Other industries that process agricultural and pastoral products will also experience significant development. Within five years, the goal is to essentially achieve "every agricultural commune having its own factory."

Industries serving industrial production and people's lives will also be developed. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, six new and expanded coal mines will be built, with a total annual output of approximately 2.5 million tons of raw coal. Qinghai wool, which ranks third in the country in terms of output, can fully supply the Xining Wool Textile Factory, which is about to be built. The raw material needed for the Qinghai Ramie Textile Factory—wild ramie—will also be obtained from the vast land of the Qaidam Basin. The large number of cattle and sheep meat in Qinghai Province and the scaleless fish produced in Qinghai Lake will also be made into thousands of tons of canned goods by the Xining Cannery to supply various parts of the country and for export. In addition, power plants, lead-zinc mining and processing plants, sugar factories, flour mills, cement plants, etc., will also be built in Xining and the Qaidam Basin within five years.

    五年后青海工业的辉煌景象：
    社社有工厂产值超过农副业
    新华社西宁24日电　在第二个五年计划期间，青海省地方工业总产值要超过农副业生产总值。这是青海省最近订出的工业大跃进规划。
    青海省地方工业基础十分薄弱，到1957年底，地方工业总产值虽比1952年增长了二十八倍，但是和农业比起来，还是相差很远，只占到全省工农业总产值的22.76％。为了急起直追赶上农业发展，在第二个五年计划期间这个省将本着勤俭建国的方针，因陋就简，依靠群众力量，大力发展肥料、煤炭以及化学、纺织、食品等工业。到1962年，全省地方工业总产值将占全部工农业总产值的54.7％。
    在今后五年内，青海省将建成大、中、小型肥料厂二千一百多个，这些工厂所产的肥料，可供四百万亩农田的需要。农牧机具的生产和修配，也将迅速发展。除本省较大的西宁农牧机械厂将适当进行扩建外，各自治州、农业区各县都将建设中型铁工厂，从事小型农牧机具的制造与修配；各农业社也将举办大批铁木农牧机具修配厂。其他为农牧业产品加工的工业，也将有很大发展。五年内，基本上达到农业社“社社有工厂”。
    为工业生产、人民生活服务的工业，也有所发展。在第二个五年计划期内，将新建和扩建六个煤矿，每年共可生产原煤二百五十万吨左右。产量居全国第三位的青海羊毛，可以充分供应即将兴建的西宁毛纺织厂。青海罗布麻纺织厂所需的原料——野麻，也将从柴达木盆地广阔的土地上取得。青海省数量颇多的牛、羊肉和青海湖所产的无鳞鱼，也将由西宁罐头厂制成上千吨罐头，供应国内各地和出口。此外，电厂、铅锌采选厂、糖厂、面粉厂、水泥厂等，在五年内也将分别在西宁和柴达木盆地等处建设起来。
