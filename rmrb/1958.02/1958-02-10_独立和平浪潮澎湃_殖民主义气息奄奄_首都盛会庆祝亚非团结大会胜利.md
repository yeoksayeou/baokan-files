Xinhua News Agency, 9th: A grand gathering was held in the capital on the evening of the 9th by people from all walks of life to celebrate the victory of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, called on the people of the whole country to further strengthen the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to better unite the Asian-African countries and the people of the world, and to strive for more brilliant achievements for the lofty cause of peace.

Among those attending the celebration were Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Chen Shutong, and more than a thousand people from all walks of life in the capital. Prominent Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji and some foreign guests in Beijing were invited to attend the celebration.

Guo Moruo delivered a long report entitled "Let the East Wind Prevail Further Over the West Wind." This report comprehensively expounded on the major achievements and historical significance of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, pointed out that the people of China will work together with the people of Asian-African countries to implement the resolutions of this conference, warmly support the recent peace proposals of the Soviet government on banning nuclear weapons testing, universal disarmament and convening a summit conference of great powers, wholeheartedly support the reasonable proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the peaceful reunification of Korea, wholeheartedly support the Chinese government's statement on the peaceful reunification of Korea, and pointed out that the American aggression forces should withdraw from Taiwan, the Taiwan Strait and the Penghu Islands as soon as possible, and the Chinese people resolutely oppose any conspiracy to create "two Chinas." In concluding his report, Guo Moruo pointed out with full confidence: "The days are not far off when the heinous colonialism and imperialism will be completely eliminated from the earth. In the not too distant future, the people of the world will surely achieve a complete, final and comprehensive victory in the great common cause of safeguarding independence and peace, eliminating imperialist wars of aggression, and promoting human happiness!" (Full text of the report is on page 4)

The celebration was presided over by Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee. In his speech, he pointed out that the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is not only a historically significant event for the Asian-African people, but also a major event in recent international life. The declaration and resolutions unanimously adopted by this conference will have a profound and far-reaching impact not only on the Asian-African people but also on the entire world.

Liao Chengzhi also said that the Chinese people are building our socialist motherland with an unprecedentedly high revolutionary spirit and labor enthusiasm, and we are also willing to make greater efforts, together with the Asian-African people and the people of the world, to strengthen unity and strive for the complete victory of the great cause of anti-colonialism and safeguarding world peace!

After Guo Moruo's report, Bao Erhan and Chu Tunan, deputy heads of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, spoke successively.

In his speech, Bao Erhan said that opposing imperialism and colonialism was the central topic of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, and the conference made a series of important resolutions for this purpose, pointing out that imperialist ambitions are the root of human disasters. This conference was a great demonstration by the Asian-African people against imperialism and colonialism. Delegates from various countries powerfully exposed the crimes of colonialism and condemned imperialist aggression.

Bao Erhan said, we are paying attention with extremely excitement: Since the Bandung Conference, in the past two years, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Malaya have gained independence, the Egyptian people have won a major victory in opposing Anglo-French aggression, and the Syrian people have won a major victory in opposing American subversive aggression activities; Indonesia is carrying out fierce struggles to recover West Irian; and Algeria, Cyprus, Oman, Ifni and vast areas of Africa have ignited the flames of national liberation. Their struggle is very heroic. The Cairo conference gave firm support to their just struggle.

Bao Erhan said that the awakened Asian and African people are increasingly recognizing that US imperialism is the most ferocious colonialism and the chief culprit of all imperialism and colonialism. If the Eisenhower Doctrine, which invaded the people of the Middle East and Africa a year ago, could still confuse some politically short-sighted people, today the Eisenhower Doctrine has become a word they deeply hate and curse.

He said that imperialism has always created rumors in Asia and Africa to alienate the friendly relations between socialist countries and the people of Asian and African countries, and suffered another failure at this conference. The eyes of the Arab people are brighter, and they will no longer be fooled. Bao Erhan also talked about the warm welcome the Chinese delegation received from the representatives of Asian and African countries, especially the people of all walks of life in Egypt, during the process of participating in the conference. He congratulated the establishment of the Egyptian-Chinese Friendship Association and wished it make a major contribution to the cause of enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people.

Bao Erhan expressed his belief that imperialism and colonialism will be submerged by the surging tide of striving for independence and defending peace.

In his speech, Chu Tunan focused on the economic and cultural resolutions adopted by the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. He said that due to the long-term enslavement and devastation of colonialism, many Asian and African countries are still in a state of economic poverty and backward modern culture today, which determines that the Asian and African people, in the struggle for and safeguarding national independence, must also take positive measures to develop the economy and promote culture, and it is necessary to further develop economic and cultural exchanges between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The economic and cultural resolutions adopted by the conference reflect this common desire of the Asian and African people.

Chu Tunan said that the economic and cultural resolutions unanimously adopted by the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, like the resolutions on imperialism and other political issues, will become the action program of the 1.7 billion people of Asia and Africa. Chu Tunan finally said: "Let all the excellent national cultural flowers bloom freely, let the colonialism that strangles national culture and destroys cultural exchanges die quickly, the future belongs to us! The new world of peace, friendship, economic and cultural prosperity belongs to us!"

The speeches of Guo Moruo, Liao Chengzhi, Bao Erhan and Chu Tunan at the conference received extremely warm applause and welcome from the audience.

After the celebration, the films "Congratulations" and "Nurse's Diary" were shown.

　　独立和平浪潮澎湃  殖民主义气息奄奄
    首都盛会庆祝亚非团结大会胜利
    据新华社9日讯　首都各界人民9日晚举行盛大集会，庆祝亚非人民团结大会的胜利。中国出席亚非团结大会代表团团长郭沫若在会上号召全国人民进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，更好地团结亚非各国和全世界人民，为崇高的和平事业获得更辉煌的成就而努力奋斗。
    出席庆祝大会的有国务院副总理陈毅、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通和首都各界人士一千多人。日本著名和平人士西园寺公一和在京的一部分外国来宾应邀出席了庆祝大会。
    郭沫若在会上作了题为“使东风进一步压倒西风”的长篇报告。这个报告全面地阐述了亚非团结大会的重大成就和历史意义，指出了全中国人民将同亚非各国人民一起努力实现这次大会的各项决议，热烈支持苏联政府最近关于禁止试验核武器、普遍裁军和召开大国首脑会议等一系列和平建议，衷心支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国关于撤退一切外国军队、和平统一朝鲜的合理建议，全心全意拥护中国政府关于朝鲜和平统一问题的声明，并且指出美国侵略势力应该尽快地完全从台湾、台湾海峡和澎湖列岛撤退出去，中国人民坚决反对制造“两个中国”的任何阴谋。郭沫若在结束他的报告时充满信心地指出：“万恶的殖民主义和帝国主义从地球上被彻底消灭的日子已经不远了。全世界人民为维护独立与和平、为消灭帝国主义侵略战争、为促进人类幸福的伟大的共同事业，在不长远的期间，一定会取得彻底的最后的全面的胜利！”（报告全文见第四版）
    庆祝大会是中国亚洲团结委员会副主席廖承志主持的。他在致词中指出，亚非人民团结大会不仅是亚非人民的一件有历史意义的大事，而且也是最近国际生活中的一件大事。这次大会所一致通过的宣言和各项决议，不仅对亚非人民，而且在全世界范围内都将发生深远重大的影响。
    廖承志又说，中国人民正以空前高涨的革命精神和劳动热忱来建设我们社会主义的祖国，我们也愿以更大的努力，和亚非人民和全世界人民一起，加强团结，为争取反殖民主义和保卫世界和平的伟大事业的彻底胜利而奋斗！
    在郭沫若报告以后，出席亚非人民团结大会中国代表团副团长包尔汉和楚图南先后讲了话。
    包尔汉在讲话中说，反对帝国主义和殖民主义是亚非人民团结大会的中心议题，大会并为此作出了一系列重要的决议，指出了帝国主义野心是人类灾祸的根源。这次大会是亚非人民对帝国主义和殖民主义的一次大示威，各国代表有力地揭露了殖民主义的罪恶和斥责了帝国主义的侵略活动。
    包尔汉说，我们以极其兴奋的心情注意着：自从万隆会议之后，两年来，摩洛哥、苏丹、突尼斯、马来亚获得独立了，埃及人民反对英法侵略和叙利亚人民反对美国颠复侵略活动取得了重大的胜利；印度尼西亚为收复西伊里安正在进行着剧烈的斗争；阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯、阿曼、伊夫尼及广大非洲地区都燃起了熊熊的民族解放的烽火。他们的斗争是非常英勇的。这次开罗会议对于他们的正义斗争都给予坚决的支持。
    包尔汉说，觉醒了的亚非人民越来越认清了美帝国主义是最凶恶的殖民主义，是一切帝国主义和殖民主义的罪首。如果说在一年前侵略中近东和非洲人民的艾森豪威尔主义还能迷惑某些政治上短见的人，而今天艾森豪威尔主义已成为他们所深恶痛绝和咀咒的一个字眼了。
    他说，帝国主义一向在亚非制造谰言来离间社会主义国家和亚非各国人民的友好关系，在这次大会上也遭到了再一次的失败。阿拉伯人民的眼睛更亮了，他们再不会上当了。包尔汉还谈到了中国代表团这次参加会议过程中，受到了亚非国家代表、特别是埃及各界人民热烈欢迎的情况。他祝贺埃中友协的成立，祝它为增强中埃人民的友谊事业作出重大的贡献。
    包尔汉表示相信：帝国主义和殖民主义必将为汹涌澎湃的争取独立和保卫和平的浪潮所淹没。
    楚图南在讲话中，着重就亚非人民团结大会通过的经济和文化决议作了阐述。他说，由于殖民主义长期的奴役和摧残，亚非许多国家今天仍然陷于经济贫困和现代文化落后的境地，这就决定了亚非人民在争取和维护民族独立的斗争中，还必须为发展经济、繁荣文化采取积极的措施，并且有必要在平等互利的基础上，进一步发展各国之间的经济和文化交流。大会通过的经济和文化决议，正是反映了亚非人民的这种共同的愿望。
    楚图南说，亚非人民团结大会所一致通过的经济和文化决议，正像关于帝国主义和其他政治问题的决议一样，将要成为亚非十七亿人民的行动纲领。楚图南最后说：“让一切优秀的民族文化花朵都自由开放吧，让绞杀民族文化和破坏文化交流的殖民主义快快死亡吧，未来是属于我们的！和平友好和经济文化繁荣的新世界是属于我们的！”
    郭沫若、廖承志、包尔汉、楚图南在大会上的讲话，受到了全场极其热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
    庆祝大会以后，放映了影片“祝贺”和“护士日记”。
