Now I will report to the conference on the main situation of the Wudongzha Agricultural Cooperative in Cixi County, Zhejiang, where I am located, in achieving a bumper cotton harvest in 1957 and realizing the goal of a hundred jin of cotton per mu ten years ahead of schedule.

In 1957, the average cotton yield in our cooperative reached 113 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 18.3% compared to the bumper harvest of 1955 and a doubling of the yield compared to 1952, greatly exceeding the highest production level of the local well-to-do middle peasants in the past.

With the development of production, the accumulation of the cooperative has expanded. In addition to paying agricultural taxes and repaying the 240,000 yuan in state loans owed due to the disaster in 1956, 179,099 yuan was left for the public accumulation fund and the public welfare fund, accounting for 13% of the total income of the cooperative. Adding to the previous surplus, the total public funds of the cooperative reached 286,443 yuan, a much thicker foundation than in the past. In 1957, the income of cooperative members also increased significantly, with a daily wage of 1.845 yuan per labor day, and an average net income of 683 yuan per household, 19.9% higher than the bumper harvest of 1955. If the income from sideline occupations of small teams and household sideline occupations is added, the net income per household exceeds 700 yuan.

Boldly adopting various production-increasing technical measures and the mass line leadership method

The achievement of such a bumper harvest is first and foremost thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The Party not only pointed out the future direction of socialism for us, but also taught us to boldly adopt various production-increasing technical measures and the mass line leadership method.

In 1957, we mainly focused on the following six key production-increasing measures: First, digging enough river mud in winter, reaching 150 dan per mu; cultivating alfalfa, increasing from 600 jin per mu in 1956 to 1,800 jin to 2,000 jin; second, all seeds used high-yielding Dai character cotton varieties, selecting individual plants first and then selecting seeds by grain, so that each seed was strong; third, sowing five to ten days earlier than in 1956, increasing the number of cotton plants per mu from 6,000 to 6,500 to 6,500 to 7,000; fourth, changing fertilization methods, changing "surface application" of alfalfa to "plowing and green burial" (scattering on the soil surface, changed to burying under the surface soil), applying more seedling fertilizer changed to applying more late-stage fertilizer, and adopting the "ditch-opening and soil-covering" fertilization method to improve fertilizer efficiency; fifth, early thinning and early setting of seedlings, implementing "binding beanstalks" (intercropping cotton with broad beans, the cotton growth period is the broad bean maturity period, after "binding beanstalks", ensure that cotton gets sufficient sunlight and air); sixth, using efficient new pesticides "1605" and "1059" to control insects.

Cooperative cadres set an example, demonstrating at each level, gradually breaking through the masses' thinking

Implementing these new technical measures was not easy. We have always adopted the method of cooperative cadres setting an example, demonstrating at each level, and gradually breaking through thinking. By doing this, on the one hand, cadres gain experience and leadership has the capital; on the other hand, with examples, cooperative members can easily learn and are easily convinced, and conservative ideas are easy to get through. For example, the problem of alfalfa as base fertilizer, the old method for many years was "surface application", scattering the alfalfa on the soil surface, the fertility is easy to escape, and when the alfalfa rots on the soil surface, there is also a toxin that affects the growth of cotton seedlings. We learned from the experience of other places and changed to "plowing and green burial", which can avoid the problems of the old method and greatly improve fertilizer efficiency. However, many cooperative members believed that the new method was good, but they had never done it before and were afraid of spending a lot of work and delaying the sowing period. In order to get through thinking, I and two cooperative cadres personally conducted experiments and found that "ditch-opening and green burial" was the best, and one worker could do eight-tenths of a field, which was not slow. When the fourth team expanded the experiment, all the cultivation station chiefs and team leaders came to visit. Everyone learned the method and saw that it was not difficult to do, and the labor was not too great. They went back and told everyone what they had seen, and the new method was promoted. However, there were also individual cooperative members who did not believe in the benefits of doing so and still adopted the ancient method of "surface application". As a result, the cotton seedlings in these cotton fields were three or four inches shorter than the cotton seedlings in the "plowing and green burial" fields, and the yield was also lower. Therefore, everyone was convinced, and some cooperative members said: "Even if you kill me next year, I will use 'plowing and green burial'."

In May, cotton aphids occurred. In the past, "223" sulfur pesticides were used to control aphids, costing more than two yuan per mu each time, and it had to be applied several times a year, with little effect. In 1957, we accepted the opinion of the technology promotion station and decided to switch to using two new pesticides, "1605" and "1059". This pesticide works quickly, and the effect can last for fifteen days, twice as long as the "223" pesticide, and it only costs three jiao per mu each time. However, the new pesticide is very toxic, and if you are not careful, people will be poisoned. A drop of the "stock solution" of the new pesticide was dropped on a rabbit for testing, and the rabbit died in less than five minutes. Therefore, many cooperative members' thinking was not clear, saying: "We don't know if it's effective or not, but people will die first if we don't do it right!" Originally, the insect control work relied entirely on women, but this time they had great concerns. Female cooperative member Tong Zhuxian said: "Everyone enjoys happiness, but do women have to die first?" Some old women also told their children not to do it. Therefore, the management committee cadres decided to take the lead themselves and conduct experiments with the members of the fourth team, and invited the chiefs of each station and the leaders of each team to visit. During the experiment, as soon as the "dilute solution" of the pesticide was applied, all the cotton aphids died in just three or four hours, and everyone was fascinated. Because they were very careful when using it, no one was poisoned. After such a demonstration, the station chiefs and team leaders were convinced, and immediately conducted experiments in their teams, summoned male and female cooperative members to watch, and taught them the method. Only then did everyone understand. Said: "If the cadres don't have any problems, we won't have any problems if we are careful." Women also actively participated, and Tong Zhuxian, who had concerns, worked especially hard. Later, red spiders occurred, and the new pesticide was also used, and the effect was equally good.

Carry out labor competitions, organize four inspections and appraisals a year

In addition to vigorously implementing advanced production-increasing technical measures, we also conscientiously carried out labor competitions, organizing four inspections and appraisals between teams each year: The first time was in the spring preparation stage, mainly checking seeds, checking land preparation, checking labor arrangements, and checking production tools; the second time was in the seedling protection stage, mainly checking full seedlings, checking pest control, drainage, and "binding beanstalks" and other work; the third time was in the cotton cultivation stage, mainly checking weeding, hoeing, and loosening the soil; the fourth time was around the beginning of autumn, mainly checking yellow seedlings and late-stage pest control. The winning production teams, in addition to receiving material rewards in accordance with the "three guarantees" regulations, were also given red flag rewards. Through inspection and appraisal, production has been greatly promoted. For example, the cotton of the fourth cultivation station, after inspection, found that "leaf jumping insects" were very serious, and more than a dozen mu had become a disaster. The cadres and members of this station were busy harvesting and selling watermelons and relaxed pest control work, and were still very complacent. They were shocked after the inspection. On the same day, each team criticized them and said that they would come to support pest control the next day. They were also embarrassed themselves, and the next day, men, women and children were mobilized, and the sprayers of each team were concentrated to support. In three days, all the "leaf jumping insects" were eliminated. Due to the labor competition, the attendance rate of cooperative members has greatly increased compared to the past. Men generally did 3,000 to 3,300 work points for the whole year, and women generally did 1,500 to 2,000 work points.

Our cooperative originally adopted the "three-level" organizational form. There was a brigade level between the team and the cooperative management committee, and the brigade had certain economic powers. In 1957, we changed the "three-level system" to a "two-level system", abolished the brigade level, and established a cultivation station as an agency of the cooperative management committee. At the same time, the production teams were merged and expanded from five to seven households to fifteen to twenty-five households. In this way, the connection between the upper and lower levels is close, and the command is flexible, which also played a certain role in ensuring the increase in production in 1957.

The National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has further encouraged our socialist revolutionary enthusiasm. We plan to increase cotton production in 1958 to an average of 131 jin to 148 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 16% to 31% compared to 1957. Although the average yield per mu in 1957 was only 113 jin, 46 mu of them had reached 148 jin to 185 jin, and one field had already reached a yield of 219.4 jin per mu. Therefore, it is entirely possible to achieve this year's production target. Now, all members of our cooperative are inspired by the slogan "See five years in three years, see the first year in three years", and are fighting with unprecedentedly high labor enthusiasm and full confidence to achieve a greater bumper harvest of cotton in 1958.

    提前十年超额实现亩产百斤棉
    罗祥根代表介绍浙江慈溪县五洞闸农业社获得棉花大丰收的经验
    现在我把我所在的浙江慈溪县五洞闸农业社一九五七年获得棉花大丰收，提前十年超额实现百斤棉的主要情况，向大会作一汇报。
    一九五七年我们社里的棉花平均达到亩产皮棉一百一十三斤，比大丰收的一九五五年增产百分之十八点三，比一九五二年增产一倍，大大超过了当地富裕中农历来的最高生产水平。
    随着生产的发展，合作社的积累扩大了，除了交纳农业税和还清一九五六年受灾欠下的二十四万元国家贷款外，留下公积金和公益金十七万九千零九十九元，占全社总收入的百分之十三。加上以前的结余，全社公有资金达到二十八万六千四百四十三元，底子比过去厚得多了。一九五七年社员的收入也有很大增长，每个劳动日报酬是一元八角四分五厘，每户平均净收入六百八十三元，比大丰收的一九五五年高出百分之十九点九。如果加上小队副业与家庭副业，每户净收入超过七百元。
    大胆采用各种增产技术措施和群众路线的领导方法
    获得这样的大丰收，首先要感谢共产党和毛主席的正确领导。党不但给我们指出社会主义的前途方向，还教导我们大胆地采用各种增产的技术措施和群众路线的领导方法。
    一九五七年我们主要抓住下面六条关键性的增产措施：第一，冬季挖足河泥，每亩达到一百五十担；培育草子（苜蓿）由一九五六年每亩六百斤达到一千八百斤至二千斤；第二，种子全部采用高产的岱字棉种，先株选、后粒选，使种子粒粒壮实；第三，比一九五六年提早五至十天播种，每亩植棉由六千至六千五百株增加到六千五百至七千株；第四，改变施肥方法，草子由“面施”改为“翻耕青葬”（撒在土面上，改为埋在表土下面），多施苗肥改为多施后期肥，并采取“开沟盖土”施肥法，提高肥效；第五，早删苗、早定苗，实行“缚豆脑”（棉花与蚕豆套作，棉花生长期正是蚕豆成熟期，“缚豆脑”以后，保证棉花得到充分的阳光和空气）；第六，采用高效的“1605”、“1059”新药剂除虫。
    社干部作样子，层层示范，逐步打通群众思想
    贯彻这些新的技术措施，不是很容易的。我们始终采取社干做样子，层层示范，逐步打通思想的办法。这样做，一方面干部取得经验，领导有了本钱；另方面，有了样子，社员们容易学会，容易信服，保守思想好搞通。譬如草子作基肥的问题，多少年来的老办法就是“面施”，把草子撒在土面上，肥力很容易逃走，草子在土面腐烂时，还有一种毒素会影响棉苗的生长。我们学习外地的经验，改用“翻耕青葬”，可以避免老办法的毛病，大大提高肥效。但是有不少社员认为新办法好是好，就是从来没有弄过，怕花工大，推迟播种期。为了搞通思想。我和两个社干亲自进行试验，摸到“翻耕青葬”以“开沟青葬”最好，一工可以弄好八分田，并不慢。在第四小队扩大试验时，各个耕作站长和小队长都来参观，大家学到了办法，看看不难办，用工也不算大，回去把亲眼看到的情况向大家一说，新办法就推广开了。但是也有个别社员就是不相信这样做的好处，仍然采取“面施”的古老办法，结果这些棉田的棉苗比“翻耕青葬”的棉苗要低三、四寸，产量也低。因此大家信服了，有的社员说：“明年就是杀我的头也要用‘翻耕青葬’了”。
    五月间，棉蚜虫发生了。过去治蚜虫都用“223”硫黄药剂，每亩一次施用要化两元多，一年要施几次，效果不大。一九五七年我们接受技术推广站的意见，决定改用“1605”、“1059”两种新药剂。这种药剂见效快，药效能维持十五天，比“223”药剂长一倍，每亩一次只要化三角钱就够了。但是，新药剂毒性很猛，一不小心，人就会中毒。用新药剂“原液”滴一滴在兔子身上试验，兔子不到五分钟就死了。所以许多社员思想不通，说：“有效无效还不知道，弄勿好先死人啦！”本来除虫工作全靠妇女，这一次她们顾虑很大，女社员童祝仙说：“享福大家享，死人要妇女先死吗？”有的老太婆还叫儿女不要去弄。于是，管委会干部决定自己先带头同第四小队社员一道进行试验，请了各站站长和各小队长来参观。试验时，药剂的“稀液”一施下去，只三、四个钟头，棉蚜虫统统死光，大家都看得出神了。因为使用时很小心，没有一人中毒。经过这样示范，站长、小队长都信服了，回去以后马上在小队里搞试验，召集男女社员来看，教会办法，大家这才搞通了思想。说：“干部没有出毛病，我们小心点也不会出毛病”。妇女也积极参加，曾经有顾虑的童祝仙还干得特别起劲。后来红蜘蛛发生，也用这个新药剂，效果同样很好。
    开展劳动竞赛，一年组织四次检查评比
    我们除了大力贯彻先进的增产技术措施外，还认真地开展了劳动竞赛，一年中组织四次队与队间的检查评比：第一次在春天备耕阶段，主要查种子、查整地、查劳动力安排，查生产工具；第二次在保苗阶段，主要查全苗、查治虫、排水和“缚豆脑”等工作；第三次是棉花培育阶段，主要查除草、中耕、松土等；第四次在立秋前后，主要查黄苗，查后期除虫。优胜的生产队，除了按“三包”规定给予物质奖励外，还给了红旗奖励。经过检查评比，大大地推动了生产。例如第四耕作站的棉花，经过检查，发现“叶跳虫”非常厉害，有十几亩已成灾。这个站的干部、社员忙于收摘和出售西瓜，放松除虫工作，还很自满，检查后才大吃一惊。当天各队对他们提出批评，并说第二天要来支援除虫。他们自己也不好意思了，第二天马上男女老少齐出动，再加上各队喷雾器集中支援，三天时间，“叶跳虫”全部消灭干净。由于开展了劳动竞赛，社员出勤率比过去大大提高，男子整劳动力全年一般都做了三千至三千三百个工分，妇女一般都做了一千五百至二千个工分。
    我们社里原是采用“三级制”的组织形式，小队与社管委会中间有大队一级，大队有一定的经济权力。一九五七年我们把“三级制”改为“二级制”，取消大队一级，设耕作站作为社管委会的派出机构，同时把生产小队由五户到七户合并扩大到十五户到二十五户。这样一来，上下联系密切，指挥灵活，对于保证一九五七年的增产也起一定的作用。
    党中央和毛主席提出的全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），进一步鼓舞了我们的社会主义革命干劲，我们计划一九五八年棉花产量达到平均每亩皮棉一百三十一斤到一百四十八斤，比一九五七年增产百分之十六至三十一。一九五七年平均每亩产量虽然还只一百一十三斤，但其中已有四十六亩达到一百四十八斤到一百八十五斤，还有一块田已经达到亩产二百一十九点四斤。因此，实现今年的增产指标是完全可能的。现在我们全社社员正在“五年看三年，三年看头年”的口号鼓舞下，用空前高涨的劳动热情，信心百倍地为实现一九五八年棉花的更大的丰收而奋斗。
