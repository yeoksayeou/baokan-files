I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng, and Director Wu Yuzhang. The rapid development of socialist construction in our country gives us infinite encouragement. I would now like to offer my personal opinions on the state of agricultural science work and the direction in which we should strive, and I invite all representatives to offer their corrections.

Since liberation, agricultural science has made great progress, resolving and explaining some agricultural production and scientific and technical theoretical issues, and accumulating some scientific data and work experience.

In the eight years since liberation, China's agricultural science has made great progress. Since the 1956 Scientific Planning Conference, it has greatly improved. Scientific workers have been able to carry out work in a planned manner under the general construction goals of the country, gradually overcoming the previous decentralized and uncoordinated practices. In 1957, it further sought cooperation with higher agricultural colleges and universities, giving play to the potential research strength of professors and lecturers in agricultural colleges and universities. Cooperation among relevant research departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has also been strengthened.

Our Party and government have always attached importance to the development of scientific work. In just a few years, a systematic agricultural science research organization has been established nationwide—the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The Academy directly administers specialized research institutes classified by crops and disciplines, major regional research institutes (such as Northeast, Northwest, and East China Research Institutes), research institutes in various ethnic autonomous regions, provincial research institutes, and many special districts and counties have established demonstration and propagation farms. A major regional research institute guides and assists three or more provincial institutes, and personnel and equipment are also initially in place. After a series of socialist transformation movements and study movements, the ideological understanding of agricultural science workers has been improved. Therefore, some problems have been solved and explained in agricultural production and scientific and technical theory, and some scientific data and work experience have been accumulated, which have been praised by the People's Government and the people.

Here, we must especially study the experimental fields in Macheng and Hong'an, Hubei. Why is their approach sweeping the country? According to the Macheng County Party Committee, it is "graduation in five minutes, both deep and thorough." This is a great leap forward in the work style of leading cadres, and also a great leap forward in the history of agricultural science in our country. Its basic key lies in combining production, combining the masses, and combining science. Our agricultural science workers must learn from them and vigorously support and participate in experimental field work. The experimental fields across the country need many Han Guangdus to support them and cooperate with them. This working method can drive us forward.

Using revolutionary spirit to break all outdated conventions, going deep among the masses and into production, summarizing high-yield experiences, and studying the causes of low yields should become the general task of agricultural science during the second five-year plan.

We must admit a fact, admit that agricultural science work is far behind production, especially since the completion of agricultural cooperativization nationwide, the masses have been creating new high-yield records every year. We have just heard about thousand-jin counties and thousand-jin townships, and then we hear about breaking the two-thousand-jin high-yield record. The heroes on the northern agricultural front are also shouting the heroic slogan of crossing the Yellow River and the Yangtze River in terms of unit area yield. At this conference, we have heard many unprecedented new things and unprecedented new plans, which makes our agricultural science work appear even more backward, and we truly feel like we are beyond hope of catching up.

We must catch up quickly, adopt a revolutionary spirit to break all outdated and decadent conventions in scientific work, resolutely and decisively go deep among the masses, go deep into production, and systematically summarize their experiences to make their experiences systematized. Then, we must quickly promote it to production, so that we can take a leap forward to catch up with the masses. In recent years, the movement to reform cultivation methods, increase the multiple cropping index, and expand the irrigated area, especially since last autumn, the large-scale water conservancy construction movement and fertilizer accumulation movement, were all created by the wisdom of the masses and revolutionary drive. It is by no means imaginable by sticking to old rules and adopting old methods. Agricultural science work is also the same. All those who can combine with production can achieve success. All those who are confined to laboratories and experimental fields will not get results for a long time. This situation is still quite serious in the agricultural science community. Without adopting revolutionary methods, there is no way to leap forward, and there is no way to catch up with the masses. What is the meaning of science that cannot catch up with the masses and production?

Going deep among the masses and into production, understanding the actual situation of the great leap forward in production, understanding the revolutionary drive of the masses, summarizing high-yield experiences, and studying the causes of low yields should become the general task of agricultural science during the second five-year plan. All other disciplines, including basic disciplines, should work around this task. Whether adopting foreign scientific achievements or adopting working methods in laboratories or experimental fields, it is all for the purpose of increasing production for the masses and supporting a bumper harvest in agriculture. Work that is relatively far away should be temporarily put aside.

Of course, we also have many basic tasks that require a portion of manpower and a relatively long time to prepare materials as soon as possible. Such as economic zoning maps, soil fertility maps, agricultural meteorological maps, groundwater hydrology maps, etc. These are arduous and complex tasks. However, we must also adopt the world's most advanced experience and use the most effective methods to make it possible to use a part of it in production as soon as a part is done. Some people think that it will take decades to produce complete finished products. That is an outdated approach and does not meet the needs of socialist construction. Some basic work can be divided and cooperated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Water Conservancy, and relevant scientific research institutions.

Intellectuals engaged in agricultural work especially need the training of mass viewpoints and labor viewpoints, and the lack of labor viewpoints and mass viewpoints is the basic reason for the backwardness of agricultural science.

The anti-rightist struggle has given us a profound education, making us realize that intellectuals must make up for a lesson, especially intellectuals engaged in agricultural work, which is even more important, that is, the training of mass viewpoints and labor viewpoints. The lack of mass viewpoints and labor viewpoints is the basic reason for the backwardness of agricultural science. Why do rightists insist that there is no science among the masses, and insist that the high yields of the masses are not science? Then why don't scientists make the highest record of high yields? The American reactionary group insisted that the two artificial satellites of the Soviet Union are two pieces of iron. Why don't they also fly the same two pieces of iron? Rightists conspire to separate us from the masses and make us stand against the masses. The Party has repeatedly educated us that Marxists-Leninists will fail immediately once they leave the masses. All work in socialist construction, including scientific work, will exert immense power once it is combined with the masses. Especially, our agricultural science workers must always be with the laboring peasants and with the great production movement. This will strengthen our training in mass viewpoints and labor viewpoints, and we will always be invincible.

With the strong leadership of the Party and the government, a considerable team, the promotion of the national people's great production movement, and the strong support of fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union, as long as we dare to remove ideological obstacles and boldly go into the ranks of the masses, we will be able to complete the glorious task of the second five-year plan.

The above opinions are for the conference to correct and criticize.

    打破清规戒律　深入群众深入生产
    陈凤桐代表谈农业科学如何迅速赶上生产发展问题
    我完全同意李先念、薄一波两位副总理、彭副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告。我们国家的社会主义建设在飞速发展，这给我们无限的鼓舞。我现在就农业科学工作的情况和应该努力的方向提出个人意见，请各位代表指正。
    解放以来，农业科学有很大发展，解决和说明了一些农业生产上和科学技术理论上的问题，积累了一些科学资料和工作经验。
    解放八年以来，我国农业科学有很大的发展，自一九五六年科学规划会议之后，又大大提高一步，科学工作者在国家总的建设目标下，得以有计划的进行工作，逐渐克服以往分散无力和各行其是的作法。一九五七年又进一步和高等农业院校谋求合作，发挥了农业院校教授、讲师科学研究的潜在力量。中国科学院有关研究部门的合作也有所加强。
    我们的党和政府，自来就重视科学工作的发展，在短短几年之内，全国已建立起有系统的农业科学研究组织——中国农业科学院，院下直属以作物和学科分类的专业研究所、各大区研究所（如东北、西北、华东等研究所）、各民族自治区研究所、各省研究所，还有不少专区县建立起示范繁殖场。一个大区研究所指导和帮助三个和三个以上省所，人员设备也都初具规模。农业科学工作者经过一系列的社会主义改造运动和学习运动，思想认识有所提高。因而在农业生产上和科学技术理论上也解决和说明了一些问题，积累了一些科学资料和工作经验，受到人民政府的表扬和人民的赞许。
    这里要特别研究一下湖北麻城红安的试验田，他的作法为什么能风靡全国。据麻城县委的说法是“五分钟毕业，又深又透”。这是领导干部作风的大跃进，也是我国农业科学史一个大跃进。他的基本诀窍在于结合生产，结合群众，结合科学，我们农业科学工作者必须向他们学习，大力支持和参加试验田工作。全国试验田需要许许多多韩光斗支援他们并和他们合作，这一工作方法可以带动我们前进。
    用革命气魄打破一切陈腐的清规，深入群众深入生产，总结丰产经验，研究低产原因，应成为第二个五年计划期间农业科学的总任务。
    我们必须承认一个事实，承认农业科学工作远远落在生产后边，特别自全国农业合作化完成以后，群众年年创造新的丰产纪录。我们刚刚听到千斤县、千斤乡，接着就听到突破两千斤的丰产纪录，北方农业战线上的英雄们又在喊出单位面积产量跨过黄河跨过长江的英雄口号。这次大会上又听到许许多多前所未闻的新事物和前所未闻的新规划，这样越来就越显得我们农业科学工作越落后，真有望尘莫及之感。
    我们必须急起直追，采用革命的气魄打破一切科学工作上陈旧腐朽的清规戒律，决然毅然深入到群众中去，深入到生产中去，系统的总结他们的经验，使他们的经验条理化。然后又迅速推广到生产中去，这样我们才能跃进一步赶上群众。几年来各地的耕作改制运动，增加复播指数，扩大灌溉面积，特别是去秋以来，大规模的兴修水利运动、积肥运动，都是群众智慧加上革命干劲所创造出来的，决不是固守成规，采用老一套的办法所能想像的，农业科学工作也是如此。凡是能和生产结合的都能得到成就，凡是局限在试验室和试验地内的，就会长期得不到结果。这种情况在农业科学界还是相当严重的，不采用革命的办法，就无法跃进，也无法赶上群众，赶不上群众，赶不上生产的科学，还有什么存在的意义呢？
    深入群众深入生产，了解生产大跃进的实际情况，了解群众的革命干劲，总结丰产经验，研究低产原因，应成为农业科学第二个五年计划的总任务。其他一切学科包括基础学科在内，都应该围绕着这一任务进行工作。无论采取外国的科学成就，无论采用试验室内或试验地内的工作方法，都是为了达到群众增产，为了支援农业大丰收的目的，比较遥远的工作，应该暂时放下不作。
    当然，我们也有许多基本工作，须分一部分人力，用较长的时间及早准备资料。如经济区划图、土壤肥力图、农业气象图、地下水文图等等这一些艰巨复杂的工作。但也必须采取世界最先进的经验，采用最有效的方法进行，使能作一部分，在生产就能利用一部分。有人认为非有几十年才能拿出完整的成品，那是陈旧的作法，不适合社会主义建设的需要。有些基本工作可以和中国科学院和水利科学院，以及有关科学研究机关分工合作。
    作农业工作的知识分子，尤其需要群众观点和劳动观点的锻炼，而缺乏劳动观点和群众观点是农业科学落后的基本原因。
    反右斗争给我们一次深刻的教育，使我们认识到知识分子必须补上一课，特别是作农业工作的知识分子，就更显得重要，那就是群众观点和劳动观点的锻炼。缺乏群众观点和劳动观点，是农业科学落后的基本原因。为什么右派分子硬说群众那里没科学，硬说群众的丰产不是科学，那么为什么科学家不作出丰产的最高纪录呢？美国反动集团硬说苏联两颗人造卫星是两块铁，为什么他们不也飞起同样的两块铁呢？右派分子阴谋把我们和群众分开，使我们和群众对立起来，党一再教育我们马列主义者一旦离开群众，就会立刻失败，社会主义建设中的一切工作，包括科学工作在内，一旦和群众结合起来，就会发挥强大无比的力量，特别是我们农业科学工作者必须永远和劳动农民在一起和大生产运动在一起，就会加强我们群众观点和劳动观点的锻炼，我们就会永远立于不败之地。
    我们有党和政府强有力的领导，有一支相当大的队伍，有全国人民大生产运动的推动，有兄弟国家特别是苏联强有力的支援，只要我们敢于扫除思想上的障碍，大胆走到群众队伍中去，我们就一定能够完成第二个五年计划的光荣任务。
    以上意见，请大会指正、批评。
