Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 8th, condemning the Japanese government for disregarding the legitimate demands of the Republic and taking practical measures to forcibly send North Korean citizens illegally detained in Japanese detention centers to South Korea. The statement also once again emphasized the need to resolve this issue quickly and fairly, in accordance with the principles put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il in his statement on the matter.

The statement accused the Japanese government of disregarding the legitimate rights and wishes of the detained North Korean citizens to return to the Republic. The Japanese authorities even detained peaceful fishermen of the Republic who drifted to Japan after encountering distress while fishing, and attempted to forcibly send them to South Korea. The statement said that in the past, Japanese fishermen who drifted to the Republic under similar circumstances were released unconditionally.

The statement exposed the fact that Syngman Rhee terrorists, who had infiltrated Japanese detention centers, used violence to suppress the will of the detained North Korean citizens to return to the Republic. The statement said that the detained North Korean citizens were completely unable to express their free will in choosing their place of residence, and that sending representatives of the Republic to Japan to deal with related issues had become a more pressing matter.

    朝鲜外务省发言人
    谴责日本迫害被扣朝鲜公民
    新华社平壤9日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人8日发表声明，谴责日本政府不顾共和国方面的正当主张，采取实际措施把被非法扣留在日本收容所中的朝鲜公民强迫遣送到南朝鲜。声明并且再一次强调按照南日外务相在关于这个问题的声明中提出的原则，迅速公正地解决这个问题。
    声明指责日本政府无视被扣留的朝鲜公民要求回到共和国的合法权利和意愿。日本当局甚至把捕鱼遇难漂流到日本的共和国的和平渔民也扣留在收容所内，并且企图把他们强迫遣送到南朝鲜。声明说，过去在同样情况下漂流到共和国的日本渔民都被无条件释放了。
    声明揭露了潜入日本收容所内的李承晚恐怖分子用暴力压制被扣留的朝鲜公民表示要回共和国的意志的事实。声明说，被扣留的朝鲜公民完全被迫不能表达选择居住地的自由意志，共和国派代表前往日本以处理有关问题，已经成为更加迫切的问题。
