    Learning from the Xi'an Aviation Technical School's Thrifty School Management
    Seventy-three Technical Schools Hold On-site Conference at Xi'an Aviation Technical School
    (Our newspaper's Xi'an dispatch) Our newspaper reporter Li Qian reports: In order to spread the flower of thrifty school management of Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School throughout the country, the Second Ministry of Machine Building held a conference of principals in Xi'an on February 1st, with seventy-three secondary specialized schools and technical workers' schools from seventeen regions participating. The advantage of this on-site conference is: on-site visits, on-site learning, on-site discussions, to further and specifically learn from the experience of Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School in running the school thriftily.
    When visiting Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School, the participating principals compared it with the conditions of their own schools and were greatly educated. The Shenyang No. 1 Chemical Industry School originally planned to ask the Second Ministry of Machine Building for fourteen more automatic lathes to meet the needs of student internships. After visiting Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School, they felt that their school's teaching buildings, dormitory buildings, and laboratories were mostly new equipment, so how could they ask the state for expensive new equipment again? Later, after inquiring that fraternal units had more than a dozen old belt lathes, they requested them to be allocated to them for students to use for internships after repair, which could save 190,000 yuan in equipment purchase costs.
    Many people also raised questions to themselves after the visit: The equipment, technical strength, and other aspects of their own school are stronger than or about the same as this school. Why can they run the school thriftily and achieve self-sufficiency, while they cannot? Everyone discussed this issue in conjunction with the experience of Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School. Many principals were moved by the school's teachers and students' full of revolutionary vigor and drive, and made self-criticisms of their own conservative thinking. The reason why some schools dared not propose a plan for self-sufficiency was that they were worried about the supply of materials, the products could not find a market, or that their equipment and technical strength were too poor; some units were also afraid that if they proposed self-sufficiency, funding would be difficult if the production plan could not be completed for some reason; other units planned to use the money earned this year to build some new houses and add some new equipment, and then propose self-sufficiency next year. In the process of discussion, various conservative ideas were gradually overcome and criticized, and the courage to catch up with advanced schools was encouraged.
    The first to raise this revolutionary spirit was the No. 221 Technical School. After learning the experience of Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School in running the school thriftily and achieving self-sufficiency, the school's leaders, teachers, and students all excitedly said: Our conditions are about the same as those of the No. 1 Aviation Technical School. If they can achieve self-sufficiency, we must catch up. After thoroughly studying the school's equipment and technical strength, they proposed to trial-produce and mass-produce products such as diesel engines and gas engines. At the same time, they also plan to produce 30 low-pressure heating boilers and 620,000 piston pins. In this way, the school plans to complete a total output value of 2.5 million yuan in 1958, achieving self-sufficiency. After the plan was formulated, the No. 221 Technical School sent representatives to the principals' meeting to propose a friendly competition for thrifty school management to all schools attending the meeting.
    The No. 221 Technical School's lead in learning from advanced schools added to the courage of other schools attending the meeting to make a great leap forward. From then on, a wave of comparing advancedness and comparing drive was set off at this meeting. The plans for part-work, part-study and self-sufficiency originally set by the schools participating in this meeting were brought forward by one to three years. Before the meeting started, only two of the eighteen technical schools participating in the meeting from the Second Ministry of Machine Building proposed self-sufficiency this year. By the end of the meeting, the number had increased to ten, and it is estimated that the state will need to provide 9.66 million yuan less in funding for the whole year. At the same time, more technical workers who can endure hardship and have cultural knowledge can be trained for the country. Many heads of secondary specialized schools believe that the experience of Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School in running the school thriftily is not only practical for all technical schools, but also a model for secondary specialized schools. The Xi'an Machinery School proposed at the meeting that the output value this year will reach 500,000 yuan, and about 37% of the funding can be solved by their own production.
    At this meeting, in addition to introducing the experience of thrifty school management in detail, Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School also humbly sought the opinions of other schools through seminars and individual conversations. Many principals put forward the problems they saw to Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School with brotherly sincerity. For example, some people think that the school is very thrifty in all aspects, but the organization is still large, the internship factory has many offices under it, and there are ten warehouses; there are also many faculty and staff. Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School accepted everyone's opinions, continued to calculate carefully, and tap its potential. By the end of the meeting, they had increased this year's total output value from 2.1 million yuan to 2.5 million yuan.
    Those attending the meeting all hope to hold more on-site conferences like this in the future. Everyone unanimously believes that this kind of conference has many benefits, can visit typical examples in person, visit at any time, conduct detailed discussions, exchange experiences, help each other, and promote each other.

    就地参观　就地学习　就地讨论
    学习西安航空技工学校勤俭办校
    七十三个技术学校到西安航空技工学校开现场会议
    本报西安讯　本报记者李茜报道：第二机械工业部为了把西安第一航空技工学校勤俭办学之花开遍全国，于2月1日，在西安召开了有十七个地区的七十三个中等专业学校，技术工人学校参加的校长会议。这种现场会议的好处是：就是就地参观，就地学习，就地讨论，进一步具体的学习西安第一航空技工学校的勤俭办学经验。
    参加会议的校长们在参观西安第一航空技工学校时，以自己学校的条件和第一航空技工学校对比，受到很大的教育。沈阳第一化学工业学校这次来开会原计划向二机部再要十四台自动化车床，以满足学生实习的需要。他们参观了西安第一航空技工学校后，感到自己学校的教学大楼、宿舍大楼、实验室，大都是新式设备，怎么好再向国家要求价值昂贵的新设备呢？后来打听到兄弟单位还多余十几台破旧的皮带车床，就提出来要求拨给他们，修理后让学生实习用，这样可以节约十九万元设备购置费用。
    也有不少人在参观后向自己提出这样的问题：自己学校的设备、技术力量及其他各方面的条件都比这个学校强，或者差不多，为什么人家能够勤俭办学，做到自给自足，而自己就做不到呢。大家结合第一航空技工学校的经验，就这个问题展开了讨论。很多校长被这个学校师生饱满的革命朝气和干劲感动了，对自己的保守思想作了检查。原来有些学校所以不敢提出自给自足的规划，是顾虑材料供应不上，产品找不到销路，或者认为自己的设备和技术力量太差；也有的单位怕自己提出自给自足，万一因故不能完成生产计划，经费会发生困难；还有的单位打算把今年赚的钱盖点新房，添点新设备，明年再提出自给自足。在讨论过程中，逐步克服和批判了各种保守思想，鼓起了向先进学校看齐的勇气。
    第一个鼓起这种革命干劲的是二二一技工学校。该校领导人员和全体师生学习了西安第一航空技工学校勤俭办学、自给自足的经验后，都兴奋地说：我们的条件和第一航空技工学校的条件都差不多，人家能做到自给自足，我们一定要赶上去。他们经过深入地研究了学校的设备和技术力量，提出试制并大量生产柴油机、煤气机等产品。同时，还计划生产低压暖气锅炉三十台，活塞肖子六十二万个。这样，全校计划1958年可以完成二百五十万元的生产总产值，实现自给自足。规划订出后，二二一技工学校就派代表到校长会议上，向到会各校提出开展勤俭办学友谊竞赛的倡议书。
    二二一技工学校带头向先进看齐的劲头，给到会的其他学校增加了大跃进的勇气。从此，在这个会议上就掀起了比先进，比干劲的热潮。参加这个会议的学校原订半工半读和自给自足的计划提前了一年到三年。在会议开始前，第二机械工业部参加会议的十八个技工学校中只有两个学校提出了今年自给自足，会议将结束时已经增加到十个，预计全年能少向国家要九百六十六万多元的经费。同时还可以为国家培养出更多能吃苦耐劳有文化知识的技术工人。许多中等专业学校的负责人认为：西安第一航空技工学校勤俭办学的经验，不仅实用于所有的技工学校，同样也是中等专业学校的榜样。西安机械学校在会上提出今年产值达到五十万元，约37％的经费可以由自己生产中解决。
    在这个会议上，西安第一航空技工学校除了详细介绍勤俭办学的经验外，也通过座谈会和个别交谈等方式虚心的征求了其他学校的意见。不少学校的校长以兄弟般的诚恳态度把自己看到的问题向西安第一航空技工学校提出来。如有些人认为这个学校各方面都很勤俭，但是机构还是庞大的，实习工厂下设很多室，还有十个库；教职员工也比较多。第一航空技工学校接受大家的意见，继续算细账、挖潜力，在会议将结束时，他们已经把今年的总产值由二百一十万元提高到二百五十万元了。
    出席会议的人，都希望今后多开这种现场会议。大家一致认为这种会议的好处很多，可以亲临典型，随时参观，详细座谈，交流经验，互相帮助，互相促进。
