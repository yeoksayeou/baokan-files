Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 23rd: To celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, the Soviet government held a grand and solemn reception in the Grand Kremlin Palace on the 23rd. Soviet Party and government leaders Aristov, Brezhnev, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Ignatov, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Kuusinen, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Suslov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, Shvernik, and Kosygin received guests in the St. George Hall.

Among those present at the reception were: Soviet Defense Minister and Marshal of the Soviet Union Malinovsky, other Soviet Marshals and generals of all branches of the Soviet Army, government ministers, representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviets of the various Union Republics, heads of social organizations, Heroes of Socialist Labor, cultural and scientific workers, and journalists. Diplomatic envoys and military attachés of various countries stationed in the Soviet Union also attended the reception.

Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Comrade Khrushchev, spoke at the meeting. He said that for forty years, the Soviet Army has traveled a glorious road. At that time, the working class seized power for the first time in human history, and it did not yet have its own military backbone, nor state staff cadres. Everything had to be built from scratch. Our army was built and tempered in battle, and cultivated commanding cadres. We do everything we can to strengthen the Soviet Army, to strengthen it spiritually and materially, and to provide it with the most modern weapons. We are proud of our army, and our army has loyally repaid the love of our people for it.

Khrushchev then raised his glass to congratulate the heroic Soviet Army and Navy, and the officers and soldiers of all levels of the Soviet armed forces. At this moment, thunderous applause and military music resounded throughout the venue.

Soviet Defense Minister and Marshal of the Soviet Union Malinovsky delivered a brief speech at the meeting. He said, we soldiers often recall with satisfaction those moments when friendship and full mutual understanding filled our midst, and we also often recall the scenes when we fought together against a common enemy. I feel that the soldiers of our various countries still maintain this pure friendship. We hope that this pure friendship between the armies of our countries can overcome all obstacles that exist in the relations between our countries, and finally achieve victory.

We deeply thank our government for its boundless care and warmth towards the Soviet armed forces. We wholeheartedly thank and express our loyalty to the founder of our armed forces - our glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which educated the armed forces, cultivated them, and tempered them in the struggle for the happiness of all Soviet people. We fully understand that we should become a powerful, modern armed force equipped with the latest technology in order to serve our Soviet country, which defends world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 24th: The activities in Moscow celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army reached their climax on the 23rd. Warm celebratory gatherings and meetings between the military and civilians were held everywhere during the day. A large-scale winter sports performance was held in Gorky Central Culture and Recreation Park. Speed ​​skaters, figure skaters, and ice dancers performed. About sixty athletes participated in winter swimming in the Moscow River.

The strongest skaters in Moscow competed at the stadium of the Central Sports Club of the Soviet Ministry of Defense. About 20,000 spectators watched the final performance of the literary and artistic performance of the Soviet Army and Navy Song and Dance Ensemble in the Luzhniki Sports Palace today.

Many people went to the suburbs to lay wreaths at the tombs of martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the motherland in the war.

In the evening, batches of Moscow residents flocked to Red Square. Children held their parents' hands, listening to their fathers tell heroic stories of Soviet soldiers as they walked. When the hour hand of the Kremlin clock pointed to eight o'clock, the victory salute opened the prelude to the festive night. Countless searchlights shot into the sky, sometimes forming a net shape, sometimes rotating around the night sky, and sometimes remaining still. Colorful fireworks bloomed heartily in the sky above the city. After the salute symbolizing the forty years of glorious history of the invincible and ever-victorious Soviet Army was fired forty times, new crowds continuously poured into Red Square.

    苏联政府举行盛大招待会庆祝建军四十年
    莫斯科到处举行庆祝集会和军民会见
    新华社莫斯科23日电　为庆祝苏联军队建军四十周年，苏联政府23日在大克里姆林宫举行了盛大隆重的招待会。苏联党和政府的领导人阿里斯托夫、勃列日?夫、布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、伊格纳托夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫、库西宁、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克、柯西金在格奥尔基大厅接待客人。
    出席招待会的有：苏联国防部长、苏联元帅马利诺夫斯基，其他苏联元帅和苏军各兵种的将领们，政府部长们、苏联最高苏维埃和各加盟共和国最高苏维埃的代表们、社会团体的负责人、社会主义劳动英雄、文化科学工作者和新闻记者。各国驻苏联的外交使节和武官，也出席了招待会。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员、苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志在会上讲了话。他说，四十年来，苏联军队走过了光荣的道路。在当时，工人阶级在人类历史上第一次掌握了政权，它还没有自己的军事骨干，没有国家工作人员干部。一切必须从头建立。我们的军队建立起来了，在战斗中锻炼出来了，培养出了指挥干部。我们尽一切力量加强苏联军队，从精神上和物质上加强它，供给它最现代化的武器。我们为自己的军队感到自豪，我们的军队也忠心耿耿地报答了我国人民对它的热爱。
    赫鲁晓夫接着举杯向英勇的苏联陆海军，向苏联武装部队的各级官兵祝贺。这时，会场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声和军乐声。
    苏联国防部长、苏联元帅马利诺夫斯基在会上发表了简短的讲话。他说，我们军人常常满意地回忆起那些在我们之间充满友情和充分相互谅解的时刻，也常常回忆起当年我们一道为反对共同的敌人而战斗的情景。我觉得，我们各国军队的战士们现在还保持着这种纯真的情谊。我们希望，我们各国军队之间的这种纯真的情谊能够克服我们各国之间的关系中存在的一切障碍，而终于取得胜利。
    我们深深地感谢我们的政府，因为它无限关心苏联武装部队并给它以温暖。我们衷心地感谢并表示矢忠于我们武装部队的缔造者——我们光荣的苏联共产党，它教养了武装部队，培育了并且在为全体苏联人民的幸福的战斗中锻炼了武装部队。我们完全清楚地了解，我们应当成为强大的、装备有最新技术的现代化的武装部队，以便为我们的保卫世界和平的苏维埃国家服务。
    新华社莫斯科24日电　莫斯科庆祝苏军建军四十周年的活动在23日达到了高潮。白天到处都在举行热烈的庆祝集会和军民会见。高尔基中央文化休息公园举行了大规模冬季体育表演。速度溜冰花样溜冰和冰上舞蹈运动员作了表演。约有六十个运动员参加了莫斯科河上的冬季游泳。
    莫斯科最强的溜冰运动员在苏联国防部中央体育俱乐部的运动场上进行了比赛。约有两万观众今天到卢日尼基体育宫中观看了苏联陆海军文工团文艺会演的最后一场。
    许多群众前往城郊向在战争中为祖国牺牲了的烈士墓前献花圈。
    晚间，莫斯科的居民一批批地涌向红场。孩子们拉着大人的手，一面走着一面听着父亲讲述苏军战士的英勇故事。当克里姆林宫的大钟的时针指向八点时，胜利的礼炮揭开了节日夜晚的序幕。无数支探照灯射向空中，忽而组成了网形，忽而沿着夜空回旋转动，忽而又静止不动。五彩缤纷的礼花在城市的上空纵情地怒放着。象征着无坚不摧、无往不胜的苏军四十年光荣历史的礼炮鸣过四十响后，新的人群又连续地涌向红场。
