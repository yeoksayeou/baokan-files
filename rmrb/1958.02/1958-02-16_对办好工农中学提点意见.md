Representatives Su Changyou, Cui Guoshan, Liang Jun, Sun Xiaoju, and Yang Maolin believe that: worker-peasant middle schools should not enroll people who do not meet the required length of service or other qualifications; worker-peasant middle schools should try their best to divide classes according to students' different educational levels to help them complete their studies; the curriculum of worker-peasant middle schools should be coordinated with the curriculum of universities; schools and teachers should strengthen tutoring for students so that they can keep up with the class; the education department should strengthen its leadership over worker-peasant middle schools to improve the quality of teaching and reach the level of general middle schools.

We are grassroots representatives from factories, mines, and railways in Heilongjiang Province. Through discussions of this year's national economic plan and budget, we see that a bright future and a strong motherland are before us. Every construction project in the plan excites us and fills our hearts with unparalleled joy, inspiring us with an unstoppable revolutionary zeal. We will devote all our efforts to the great leap forward of socialist construction in our magnificent motherland and strive hard under the leadership of the Party!

Through the discussion of the "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme," we feel that it is a good key for millions of workers and peasants to learn culture, engage in science, and improve production. Therefore, we warmly support this scheme and are willing to contribute to its implementation.

Below, we would like to offer some suggestions for the continued enrollment of students in worker-peasant middle schools this autumn:

After liberation, the Party and the state spent a lot of money to establish worker-peasant rapid middle schools. They sent us to school to improve our education, remove the label of illiteracy, and enable us to master intermediate or advanced cultural and scientific knowledge, becoming educated workers.

Now, looking back, we feel extremely excited and infinitely grateful to the Party and the state for their meticulous care for us workers and peasants. They freed us from the abyss of illiteracy, and now we can express our thoughts and feelings in writing, especially helping us improve production. This enables us, who are now masters of the country, to exert even greater efforts to build a socialist society!

The establishment of worker-peasant rapid middle schools, which has cultivated tens of thousands of worker-peasant intellectuals, has achieved great results, but we believe that there are also some shortcomings, and we would like to make a few suggestions regarding this:

1. According to the enrollment conditions: we should adhere to the principle of "enrolling outstanding workers, peasants, and worker-peasant cadres with a certain length of service and a certain level of education," but some worker-peasant middle schools have also enrolled individuals who do not meet the required length of service or other qualifications, which has had adverse effects. Therefore, we hope that strict attention will be paid to the enrollment conditions this autumn to prevent similar phenomena from occurring again.

2. "Rapid" means completing six years of middle school courses in three years (now changed to four years), but some people cannot handle it, and their health collapses after one or two years of enrollment. The reason for this, in addition to poor foundations and older age, is mainly due to the lack of sufficient time for review and consolidation of lessons. As a result, some model workers cannot persevere in their studies, drop out halfway, and do not even receive their diplomas, which makes them very sad. Therefore, we hope that in the future, worker-peasant middle schools can try their best to divide classes according to the different cultural levels of workers, peasants, or cadres to help them complete the learning tasks assigned to them by the Party and the state.

3. The curriculum of worker-peasant rapid middle schools is not well connected with the curriculum of universities. Universities have courses in Russian and engineering drawing, but worker-peasant middle schools do not have these two courses, which creates some difficulties for worker-peasant students entering universities. As a result, most worker-peasant students in some universities are exempt from Russian. We feel that this is a loss (although they make up for it later, they lag behind others). Therefore, we hope that the curriculum of worker-peasant middle schools can be coordinated with the curriculum of universities. This will powerfully help worker-peasant students digest university courses.

4. Worker-peasant students in universities have received support and help from schools and teachers, but we hope that the schools will further increase their support, and especially hope that the teachers of undergraduate courses will further strengthen their tutoring for them. Although "the master leads you to the door, but the cultivation is up to you," it should be considered that worker-peasant students still find it very difficult to keep up with the class, and individual cultivation is even more difficult. Therefore, we hope that schools and teachers will strengthen their tutoring so that they can overcome their inability to keep up and catch up quickly.

5. The number of worker-peasant students admitted to universities has been increasing year by year, but the increase is not large enough. Judging only from last year's candidates, there were many candidates, and the number of general middle school students admitted was also quite large, almost one out of every two. However, the number of people admitted from worker-peasant middle schools was too small. For example, only two people were admitted from a high school class at the Shenyang Coal Mine Workers' School, and some worker-peasant middle schools only admitted one person out of fifty. Although some worker-peasant middle schools have guaranteed places, the number is also small. Therefore, we hope that the education department will strengthen its leadership over worker-peasant middle schools so that the teaching quality of worker-peasant middle schools can be improved and reach the level of general middle schools.

### 对办好工农中学提点意见

    对办好工农中学提点意见
    苏长有、崔国山、梁军、孙孝菊、杨茂林代表认为：工农中学招生不要吸收工龄不够和其他不合条件的人；工农中学尽力分编班次，帮助文化程度不同的学生完成学习任务；工农中学的课程能同大学的课程配合起来；学校和老师对学生要加强辅导，以便他们能跟上班；教育部门应该加强对工农中学的领导，使教学水平提高，达到一般中学水平。
    我们是黑龙江省工矿铁路的基层代表，通过讨论今年的国民经济计划和预算，使我们看到：美好的未来，富强的祖国，摆在我们面前。计划中每一项建设，都使我们激动，使我们内心感到无比的欢乐，鼓舞着我们有一股猛不可挡的革命干劲。我们要为壮丽的祖国——社会主义建设的大跃进，拿出我们所有劲头，在党的领导下，努力奋斗！
    通过讨论“汉语拼音方案”，我们觉得，这是为千百万工农群众学文化，搞科学，提高生产的一把好钥匙。所以我们热烈地拥护这个方案，也愿意为它的实施贡出一分力量。
    下边我们想对工农中学今秋继续招生提些意见：
    解放后，党和国家花了很多的钱，开办工农速成中学。把我们送进了学校，提高文化，摘掉了文盲帽子，使我们掌握了中等或高等的文化科学知识，成为有文化的劳动者。
    现在回想起来，真使我们心里万分兴奋，无限的感激党和国家对我们工农群众无微不至的关怀。使我们摆脱了文盲的苦海深渊，现在已经能用文字表达自己的思想感情，特别是帮助我们提高生产。这就使当了国家主人的我们，为建设社会主义社会发挥出更大的干劲！
    开办工农速成中学，培育出数以万计的工农知识分子，收到很大的成绩，但我们认为也有一些缺点，并对此提出几点建议：
    1．按招生条件：应坚持“吸收具有一定工龄和一定文化程度的优秀工人，农民，工农干部入学”，但有的工农中学却将个别工龄不够的和其他不合乎条件的人也招进来了，因而产生了副作用。所以我们希望今秋招生要严格注意招生条件，防止发生上述类似的现象。
    2．速成，是以三年（现改四年）学完六年的中学功课，但有的人吃不消，入学一二年身体就搞垮了。其原因除了基础差、年岁较大之外，一个主要原因是没有充分复习和巩固功课的时间所造成的。因此有些劳模学习坚持不下去了，中途辍学，毕业证书都没有拿到，他们的心里是非常难过的。所以我们希望今后工农中学能尽力想法分编班次，帮助各种文化程度不同的工农群众或干部完成党和国家交给他们的学习任务。
    3．工农速成中学与大学的课程衔接不上，大学有俄文，工程制图课，而工农中学却没有这两门课，因而就给上大学的工农学生造成一些困难。因此有的大学的工农学生大部分都免修了俄文。我们觉得这是个损失（虽然后来补修，但要落在他人之后）。所以我们希望工农中学与大学的功课能配合起来。这就有力的帮助工农学生消化大学的课程。
    4．在大学的工农学生得到了学校和老师的支持和帮助，但是还希望学校再进一步给予支持，尤其希望本科老师进一步加强对他们的辅导，虽然“师傅领进门，修行在个人”，但是要考虑到工农学生跟上班还觉得很吃力，至于个人修行就更为困难了。所以希望学校和老师对他们加强辅导，以便能够使他们克服跟不上班，而能迅速的赶上去。
    5．几年来考入大学的工农学生的数字是逐年增加的，但增加数字不够多。仅从去年考生看，考生较多，录取一般中学生的名额也是不少的，几乎二个人取一个，但工农中学考入的人数则太少了。如沈阳煤矿工人学校一个高中班才考上二个人，又有的工农中学五十个人才考上一个人。虽然工农中学有些保送的，但也是不多的。所以我们希望教育部门应对工农中学加强领导，使工农中学教学质量提高，能达到一般中学水平。
    以上意见是否妥当，请批评指正。
