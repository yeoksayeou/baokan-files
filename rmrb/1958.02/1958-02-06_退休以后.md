　　After Retirement
　　By our reporter Ye Jianyun

　　The winter before last, a red stove was set up in the Five Emperors Temple in the east of Zhangjiafen Village. Since then, the clanging of iron-hammering has attracted many old men, with hands in their sleeves and heads shrunk into old sheepskin coats, who were preparing for the winter.

　　The Five Emperors Temple is like the Land God Temple at the head of a village in the south, no bigger than a room. Although the room is small, it is perfect for setting up a blacksmith shop. The stove fire is red, and the old men gather around to watch the novelty. After a while, an elderly man took a hot, glowing iron patty out of the red stove with tongs, and after a few hits, a few burns, and a few repairs, a new hoe was made.

　　In the countryside, it is not uncommon to see groups of people watching blacksmithing. However, the people of Zhangjiafen are very interested in this red stove for a special reason.

　　For many years, no blacksmith shop has been set up in the villages around here. If old farm tools needed tempering or adding steel, they had to go to Fengtai or Changxindian. The journey was long and wasted time, and just waiting for the work would take at least ten days or half a month. It was inconvenient, but there was nothing to be done about it.

　　Not long ago, an old man returned to the village. He was sixty-four or five years old and in good spirits. As soon as he came home, he asked the village cadres for work. He was a retired old worker from the Changxindian Vehicle Factory. He had been working hard in the factory for fifty years since he was sixteen, and no one dared to ask him to work again.

　　However, he said that he was an old blacksmith, an eighth-grade craftsman, and had some skill in controlling the wind, watching the fire, and using tongs and hammers. He was old, and if he didn't use it, wouldn't this skill be taken to the coffin with him?

　　When people heard this, they tried to dissuade him: There is no factory in the village, so your skills are not needed, and there is no way to use them. The old man was straightforward and determined to do what he said. This year was the year of the upsurge of agricultural cooperation. In one winter, eight villages and more than 900 households formed the Red May Agricultural Production Cooperative. While the village was engaged in cooperation, the old man went for a stroll in the fields. On the river bank, a member of the cooperative was plowing the ground, sweating profusely, and the adze had only cut a few inches into the soil. He walked forward and said:

　　"Brother, take a break!" He took the adze and examined it with the eyes of a craftsman.

　　"Hey! This thing is blunter than an old lady's teeth, thanks to you young people..."

　　"The steel is all worn out, so we have to make do with it." After saying that, the young man took the adze and continued to work hard.

　　In the evening, he found the Party branch secretary and said that he wanted to open a blacksmith shop to help the cooperative repair and manufacture farm tools. He also said some reasons.

　　This made the branch secretary very embarrassed. If he didn't agree, the old man was sincere, and besides, the cooperative had expanded and needed a shop. If he agreed, people were retiring home, and at such an old age, they still had to worry and suffer, which was not right. After thinking for a long time, he had to use words to prevaricate him.

　　"You are old, and everyone will welcome you to contribute to the cooperative. However, the cooperative has just been established, and the funds are not so readily available..."

　　Before the branch secretary finished speaking, the old man said with great interest:

　　"I am receiving a pension from the state, and working for the cooperative is purely an obligation..."

　　The branch secretary interrupted him: "That's not what I meant. I said that opening a blacksmith shop requires capital, and we can't afford it."

　　"It doesn't take much capital. I haven't spent the pension I just received, so let's use it first!"

　　The branch secretary wanted to say something more, but he couldn't say it.

　　This old man's name is Zhang Shun. He was the leader of the workers' picket team in the Changxindian factory during the "February 7th" strike. He is not a Communist Party member, but he has always believed in the Party. This retirement made him very moved. He said, the Party thinks of us old people, why can't we think of the Party! He also said, although I am old, my mind is clear. The Party is correct and advocates well, and we must all work together to fully realize the benefits of the Party. I opened a blacksmith shop in the cooperative to realize the Party's correct advocacy.

　　Because he had this ambition, no difficulty could stop him. Opening a blacksmith shop required a set of tools. At that time, the cooperative was very difficult and could not afford this set of tools. So he ran around, trying to overcome the difficulties. Lacking bellows, he borrowed them from a neighbor who had opened a tofu shop; needing an anvil, he found it at a friend's house who had opened a shoe shop; he also borrowed a sledgehammer; he found a few pieces of iron sheet from broken oil drums and repaired a red stove; he took out eight yuan to buy hundreds of pounds of coal. In four or five days, without spending a penny from the cooperative, a blacksmith shop was set up.

　　According to what he told people afterward, he actively prepared for this blacksmith shop for three purposes. First, to help the cooperative members repair farm tools and reduce some of the labor burden; second, to pass on his skills to the young people in the countryside; third, to prevent his body, which had worked for a lifetime, from becoming lazy.

　　Now, all three of his goals have been achieved. Last year alone, this blacksmith shop produced 50 varieties and 4,000 pieces of farm tools for the cooperative, creating nearly 2,000 yuan of wealth. It also created a sweet potato digging machine powered by livestock.

　　It turned out that in the autumn of the year before last, a cold wave was coming, and the cooperative still had more than 200 mu of sweet potatoes that had not been harvested. Digging sweet potatoes is a laborious and time-consuming job. The best labor force can only dig eight or nine fen of land a day. According to the cooperative's labor force situation, it would take 20 days to dig more than 200 mu of sweet potatoes. Seeing that this batch of sweet potatoes was about to suffer disaster, Zhang Shun quietly locked himself in his room, lit an oil lamp, and worked for two nights, resulting in the production of a sweet potato digging machine. Using this machine, one animal plus three or four semi-laborers (picking sweet potatoes in the ground) can harvest 15 mu of sweet potatoes a day. Because it is modified with old plows, each one costs only a few yuan. That year, the Red May Cooperative's sweet potatoes were dug out in less than five days, and not a single fen of land was affected by the disaster.

　　In the past two years, he has also personally trained two apprentices. Zhao Zhenxiang is an orphan who lost his parents at an early age, and Wang Lu is a young man who likes to play and quarrel, but these two young men learned not only how to hold tongs and watch the fire, draw and scribe, and recognize the properties of various steels from Zhang Shun in more than a year; but also learned from him the good qualities of diligence, loving the cooperative like home, and actively serving the cooperative.

　　Currently, the Red May Cooperative is building a reservoir on the Mangniu River. Since the reservoir construction site started, Zhang Shun and his apprentices' blacksmith stove has been busy day and night. When the members of the cooperative stop working at night, they repair tools overnight. The cadres of the cooperative advised him to rest earlier and not to get tired. He replied: "The spring plowing is coming soon. Before the thaw, we must prepare all the farm tools needed for spring plowing on the red stove."

　　退休以后
　　本报记者　叶剑韵
    大前年的冬天，张家坟村东头的五帝庙里，设置了一盘红炉。从此，叮叮噹噹打铁的声音，把许多袖着手、头缩在老羊皮袄里准备过冬的老汉们都吸引到五帝庙里来了。
    五帝庙就像南方村头上的土地庙一样，大不过一间房子，屋子虽小，摆一个铁匠铺是再合适不过的。炉火红彤彤的，老汉们围着看新鲜。少顷，一个上了年纪的老汉，用钳子从红炉里取出了一块灼热燎亮的铁饼子，几打、几烧、几修，一把新的锄头制成了。
    在农村里，围上成群的人瞧着打铁，这本来没什么稀罕。可是张家坟的人对这盘红炉，发生浓厚的兴趣，是别有一番来历的。
    多少年来，这一带的村子上就没有安过铁匠铺，旧农具要淬点火，加点钢，都要上丰台或是长辛店去，路远误工不算，光等，一件活至少要十天半个月。是不方便，可是这也没有法子。
    不久以前，村子上回来个老汉，这人六十四五岁，精神满好，一来家就向村上的干部讨活儿干。他是长辛店车辆工厂退休的老工人，十六岁就出去做工，辛辛苦苦在工厂里忙了五十年，还有谁好意思再派他干活儿。
    可是，他说他是个老锻工，是个八级工匠，在掌风看火、使钳轮锤方面还有两下子，人已经老了，再不用，难道让这身手艺带到棺材里去不成。
    人家见这么说，也就解劝道：村上没有工厂，使不上你的手艺，那也是没法。老汉是个直心人，说到一定要做到。这一年是农业合作化高潮的一年，一个冬天，八个村子九百多户人家组成了红五月农业生产合作社。村上在搞合作化，老汉却去地里蹓跶。河坎上一个社员在刨地，累得满头大汗，鹤嘴镐才啃了几寸土。他走向前去说道：
    “老弟，息着吧！”随手接过镐头，用他那工匠扯眼划线的姿势端详了一番。
    “咳！这家伙比老大娘的牙齿还钝，亏得你们年青人……。”
    “钢全磨光啰，只好将就着使。”说完，年青人接过镐头又使劲地干起来了。
    晚上，他找到了党支部书记，说他想办个铁匠铺，帮助社里修造农具。同时还说了一些道理。
    这下可把支部书记弄得为难起来了。不答应他吧，老人是出于至诚，何况社扩大了，需要有个铺子。答应他吧，人家是回家养老的，这么大年岁，还要操心受累，有些说不过去。想了半天，他只好用言语支吾他了。
    “你这大年纪了，想为社里出把力，大伙一定是欢迎的。不过，社刚办起来，资金还不那么凑手……。”
    没等支部书记说完，老汉却兴致勃勃地说：
    “我是拿国家养老金的，为社劳动纯粹是义务性质……。”
    支部书记又打断了他的话：“不是这个意思，我说办铁匠铺得本钱，我们还拿不出本钱。”
    “用不了几个本钱，我刚领来的养老金还没花完，先垫着使吧！”
    支部书记想再说点什么，又说不出口。
    这个老人的名字叫张顺。他是“二七”大罢工时期长辛店工厂工人纠察队的小组长。他不是共产党员，但是一直相信党。这次退休使他十分感动。他说，党替我们老年人设想，为什么我们就不能替党设想哩！他又说，我人虽老心眼儿可明白。党正确，主张好，要大家动手干才能把党的好处全部发挥出来。我在社里办个铁匠铺，就是为了实现党的正确主张。
    由于他抱定了这个志向，什么困难也就难不倒他了。办铁匠铺要一套工具，当时社里很困难，买不起这套工具。于是他就东奔西走，想办法克服困难。缺风箱，他到一家开过豆腐坊的邻居家里借来了风箱；要砧子，在一家开过鞋铺的朋友家里找到了砧子；又借到了大锤；找了几片破油筒上的铁皮，修了个红炉；自己拿出八元钱买了几百斤煤炭。上下四五天工夫，没有花社里一元钱，一个铁匠铺就办起来了。
    据他事后告诉人，他积极地筹办这个铁匠铺一共有三个目的。第一、帮助社员修理农具，减轻一些劳动负担；第二、把手艺传授给农村里的年青人；第三，不让劳动了一辈子的身子骨懒散下来。
    现在，他的这三个目的全实现了。去年一年，这个铁匠铺为社里生产了五十个品种四千件农具，创造了近两千元的财富。还创造了一种以牲畜为动力的刨白薯机械。
    原来前年秋天，寒潮就要来了，社里有两百多亩白薯还没有收。刨白薯这是一件既出力又费工的活，上好的劳动力，一天只刨八、九分地。根据社里劳动力的情况，二百多亩白薯得花二十天的时间才能刨完。眼看这批白薯就要遭灾了。这时，张顺却不声不响，关在自己屋子里，点上油灯，赶了两个通宵，结果制成了一种刨白薯的机械。用这种机械工作，一匹牲口，再加三、四个半劳动力（在地拣白薯），一天可收十五亩白薯。因为是用旧犁杖改装，每部成本只花几块钱。这一年红五月社的白薯，不到五天就刨完了，一分地也没有受灾。
    两年来，他还亲手培养了两名徒弟。赵振湘是一个自幼失去了父母的孤儿，王禄是一个爱玩好斗嘴的青年人，可是这两个小伙子跟张顺学手艺，不仅在一年多以前就能掌钳看火，描图划线，认识多种钢铁的性能；而且还跟他学到了勤劳，爱社如家，积极为社服务的好品质。
    目前，红五月社正在盲牛河上修水库。自从水库工地开工以来，张顺师徒们的这盘铁匠炉子就日夜忙个不停。夜晚当社员们息工的时候，他们就连夜检修工具。社里的干部劝他早点休息，别累坏了。他却回说：“春耕快来了，在解冻以前，我们红炉上要把春耕所需的农具全部准备出来。”（附图片）
