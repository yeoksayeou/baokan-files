Spring is Calling
Zheng Zhenduo

First thing in the morning, I heard the sound of firecrackers, crackling and popping outside the gate. This joyful call awakens the dormant spring and signals hundreds of millions of people to rise up and work even harder. The gunpowder smell of firecrackers is quite stimulating, bringing people an indescribable feeling of joy and exhilaration. The earth-shattering, thunderous sounds make children cover their ears, screaming with a mixture of joy and fear. Everything is a sign of the approaching spring.

The winter sunlight is particularly warm, and the air in the fields feels especially fresh. From the moment the peach-red glow of dawn appears in the east, millions of people are already up and working in the fields. They are busily building reservoirs, digging ditches, dredging canals, sinking wells, and accumulating fertilizer, transforming millions of acres of dry land into paddy fields, and competing with nature to sweep away the countless sufferings of floods, droughts, and insect plagues that have plagued humanity since time immemorial. The saying "Man can conquer nature" can be realized in this great era.

There is an old saying: "The whole year's work depends on a good start in spring." Now we are ahead of time. It is not only "the whole year's work depends on a good start in winter," but also "the whole year's work depends on a good start in autumn."

As soon as the autumn harvest was completed, the peasants continued to work tirelessly in the fields without taking a break. Plowing the land, accumulating fertilizer, digging ditches, dredging canals, sinking wells, and building large, medium, and small reservoirs all began immediately after the autumn harvest. "Autumn harvest, winter storage" is an outdated saying. Nowadays, even in autumn and winter, the countryside is extremely busy. The peasant brothers are competing with the worker brothers, all working with full vigor, not letting a moment slip away. They are now free from any time constraints. The "lunar calendar" and its rules from the feudal era are completely unsuitable in socialism. Everything is to serve socialist construction and production. The busy autumn and winter seasons, breaking with "convention," are not only preparing for "spring plowing" but also striving to prepare better conditions for agricultural production for generations to come.

This year's spring plowing, with the preparatory work of the past autumn and winter seasons, including fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy projects, has greatly different conditions. Socialism is, after all, a revolution. Agricultural production must also undergo a revolution. Places that could never grow rice before are now planting it. "It's not that they can't, but that they don't do it." What used to be barren mountains, grasslands, and low-lying areas will now become lush green fields and orchards laden with fruit, bending the branches. What used to be the northern frontier, with yellow sand obscuring the sky and white frost covering the ground, will now be transformed into a Jiangnan scene with "various flowers growing and trees lining the banks" and clear, rippling spring waters.

This spring is a joyful and enthusiastic spring! It is a spring that breaks all conventions. It is the beginning of a transition from old-fashioned agricultural production to new, scientific agricultural production. It is the beginning of "man conquering nature," breaking the shackles and limitations of nature.

How can one depict such a "spring scene"?

How can one narrate the "transformation" of the ancient face of nature?

A magnificent scene is about to begin in Jiangnan, and it will also begin north and south of the Yellow River, and also in the northern frontier and southern deserts, etc.

Millions of people, carrying hoes, driving herds of cattle and horses, are heading towards the vast and boundless fields. In the soft light of dawn, they all start working together, sowing seeds and transplanting rice seedlings. Millions of people, like one person, are working diligently, singing the "Youth Shock Brigade" song in unison. The loud singing soars into the clouds, scaring away the crows that have been gathering on the newly plowed fields for tens of thousands of years to peck at insects. This magnificent song, this socialist song, sings out the inner feelings and joy of hundreds of millions of peasants. This is the great manifestation of the liberated productive forces; this is the liberation of the infinite "atomic energy" of the people!

People are full of energy, full of strength. It is the radiation of endless light and heat, the display of incomparably brilliant collective power. No matter how cold the winter is, whether it is minus twenty degrees or even colder, people still diligently work in the fields as usual. The light and heat that people radiate drive away the severe cold. These are unprecedented phenomena, appearing in an unprecedented great era. When spring arrives, this immeasurable force will become even greater.

The loud call of these firecrackers is the call of spring, the call of the infinite power of the liberated people.

The branches of the street trees have already sprouted faint hints of green. Heaps of fertilizer are piled up in the black and yellow fields. Waiting only for the ground to thaw, spring plowing will begin.

Spring is calling. – Written on the morning of February 18, 1958

### 春天在呼唤

    春天在呼唤
    郑振铎
    一大早就听见炮仗的声音，劈劈拍拍地在大门外响着。这欢乐的呼唤，是唤起了潜伏的春天，也是唤起了亿万人民的起来更加起劲地干活的信号。炮仗的火药味儿是够刺激的，带给人们一股说不出的既愉快又振奋的劲头。震撼人心的霹雳般的响声，使孩子们掩着双耳又喜又惊地在尖叫。一切都是春天将要到来的征兆。
    冬天的太阳光特别和暖，田野的空气显得特别新鲜。千千万万的人，从东方刚露出桃红色的曙光的火苗儿，就纷纷地起来下地了。他们在紧张地兴修水库、开沟、挖渠、打井、积肥，要把千千万万亩的旱田化为水田，要和大自然争个胜负，把世世代代，自有人类以来，吃尽无量数的苦头的涝、旱和虫灾，一下子扫除干净。“人定可以胜天”这句话，在这个大时代里是可以实现的了。
    有句老话“一年之计在于春”。现在是走在时间的前头了。不仅是，“一年之计在于冬”。而且是，“一年之计在于秋”。
    农民热火朝天地在秋收一完毕，就不曾歇一口气地继续地赶作着田间的活计。翻地，积肥，开沟，挖渠，打井，修建着大、中、小型的水库，都已经在秋收刚完的时候就开始动手了。“秋收冬藏”是句过时的话了。如今，即在秋、冬二季，也是农村里十分忙碌的时候。农民兄弟们正和工人兄弟们在竞赛，全都鼓足了干劲，一刻也不曾让时间从指缝里滑溜过去。他们现在是不受任何时间的限制了。封建时代的“农历”和规律，在社会主义里是完全不合用的了。一切是为了社会主义的建设和生产服务。秋天和冬天打破“常规”的忙碌，不仅为了“春耕”做好准备工作，而且，也是为了世世代代的农业生产准备更好的条件而努力着。
    今年的春耕，有了去年的秋冬二季的准备工作，包括积肥和兴修水利在内，条件是大为不同了。社会主义本来是革命嘛。农业生产也是同样地要来一个革命。向来不能种水稻的地方，如今也种上了。“非不能也，是不为也。”向来是一带荒山，一片草原，一区洼地，如今是要变成碧油油的田地和水果累累，压湾树枝的果园地带了。向来是黄沙蔽天，白霜满地的塞北，如今是，将要使之成为“杂花生树”春水潾潾的江南了。
    这个春天，是好一个愉快而热烈的春天呀！是打破一切常规的春天。是从旧式的农业生产走向新的科学的农业生产的开始。是“人定胜天”，是打破大自然的束缚与限制的开始。
    将怎样描绘这样的一幅“春景”呢？
    将怎样叙状大自然的古老面貌的“改头换面”的经过呢？
    弘伟的场面就将在江南开始了，也就将在黄河南北开始了，也就将在塞北漠南等等地区开始了。
    千千万万的人，掮着锄头，赶着牛群和马匹，走向广漠无边的田野，在晨曦的柔光之下，一齐动手，播种的播种，插秧的插秧。千千万万的人，像一个人似的，在辛劳地工作着，人们在齐声地唱着“青年突击队”的歌，歌声高响入云，把几万年来就飞集在新翻过的田地上啄食虫儿的乌鸦都吓得远走高逃了。这弘壮的歌声，这社会主义的歌声，唱出了亿万农民的内心的感情与欢乐。这就是解放了的生产力的伟大的表现；这就是无穷大的人民的“原子能”的解放！
    人们浑身是劲，浑身是力。是无穷尽的光与热的放射，是无比光辉的集体力量的显示。不管冬天是多末寒冷，是零下二十度还是更冷的天气吧，人们还是照旧地辛劳地下地干活。人们所放射出来的光与热，把严寒赶跑了。是从来不曾有过的现象，出现在从来不曾有过的大时代里。到了春天，这股不可测知的力量就要更加巨大了。
    这一声声的炮仗的响亮的呼唤，就是春的呼唤，就是无穷大的解放了的人民的力量的呼唤。
    街树的枝头上已经泛出了隐隐的绿意。黑色的和黄色的田野上，一堆堆的积放着肥料。只等待到地上开了冻，春耕就要开始了。
    春天在呼唤着呢。　——1958年2月18日晨写
