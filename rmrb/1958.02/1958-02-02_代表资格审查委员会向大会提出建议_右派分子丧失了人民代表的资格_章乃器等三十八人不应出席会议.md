Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch. Ma Mingfang, Chairman of the Credentials Committee, delivered a report on February 1st to the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress on the examination of the qualifications of newly elected representatives and the qualifications of rightist elements such as Zhang Naiqi. The report was adopted in its entirety. The full text of the report is as follows:

During the period from the Fourth Session to the Fifth Session, the following National People's Congress representatives passed away: Mu Yiti, Kui Yanfang, Chen Chengyi, Lan Gongwu, Guan Wensen, Qi Baishi, Yang Gang, Jian Yujie, Wang Tongzhao, Wu Huanyu, and Long Sangong, eleven in total. The qualifications of the following representatives were revoked due to their status as rightists: Qian Duansheng, Shen Zhiyuan, Yang Yitang, Jiang Feng, Liu Lanqi, Sha Wenhan, Yang Si Yi, Wang Guosong, Li Shihao, Song Yunbin, Yao Shunfu, Feng Xuefeng, Zeng Zhaolun, Xiang De, Tan Tiwu, and Lei Tianjue, sixteen in total. Together with the five vacancies from before the Fourth Session, thirty-two representatives should be newly elected. During the period from the Fourth Session to the Fifth Session, Zhejiang Province newly elected eight representatives: Wu Xian, Yu Zhongwu, Yu Zuochen, Xu Chiwen, Tang Xunze, Dong Yumao, Pan Tianshou, and Huo Shilian. The Credentials Committee examined the qualifications of the aforementioned eight representatives based on their election certificates and other relevant materials. The result of the examination is that their qualifications as representatives should be confirmed as valid.

At the same time, the Credentials Committee examined the report submitted by the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee, based on the decision of the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress, requesting the revocation of the qualifications of rightists Zhang Naiqi, Pan Dakui, and Zeng Shufan as representatives to the National People's Congress; and the reports from the People's Committees of eleven provinces and cities, including Guangxi, Lüda, Wuhan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Shandong, Fujian, and Gansu, regarding the requests by a majority of the people's representatives of those provinces and cities to revoke the qualifications of rightists Huang Shaohong, Chen Mingshu, Huang Xianfan, Fei Zhendong, Qiao Chuanjue, Ma Zhemin, Zhang Bojun, Ye Duyi, Cheng Shifan, Pan E'wang, Luo Longji, Fei Xiaotong, Chu Anping, Qian Weichang, Qian Sunqing, Ou Baichuan, Wang Tianxi, Han Zhao'e, Ding Ling, Zhang Dongmu, Xie Xuehong, Yang Ziheng, and Zheng Lizhai, twenty-three people in total, as representatives to the National People's Congress; and the reports from the People's Committees of five provinces and cities, including Guangdong, Henan, Hubei, Tianjin, and Yunnan, regarding the requests by a majority of the people's representatives of those provinces and cities to suspend the performance of duties of rightists Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, Xu Zhucheng, Huang Yaomian, Wang Yizhai, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Yunchuan, Zhu Junyun, Bi Mingqi, Tan Zhiqing, Long Yun, and Li Zuoan, twelve people in total, as representatives to the National People's Congress. These reports point out that the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and deeds of rightists such as Zhang Naiqi have betrayed the fundamental principles of the Constitution. They have politically lost the qualifications to serve as representatives to the National People's Congress and should have their qualifications as representatives revoked or have their performance of duties as representatives to the National People's Congress suspended. Based on the reports from the People's Committees of the aforementioned electoral units and after discussion, the Credentials Committee believes that rightists Zhang Naiqi, Pan Dakui, Zeng Shufan, Huang Shaohong, Chen Mingshu, Huang Xianfan, Fei Zhendong, Qiao Chuanjue, Ma Zhemin, Zhang Bojun, Ye Duyi, Cheng Shifan, Pan E'wang, Luo Longji, Fei Xiaotong, Chu Anping, Qian Weichang, Qian Sunqing, Ou Baichuan, Wang Tianxi, Han Zhao'e, Ding Ling, Zhang Dongmu, Xie Xuehong, Yang Ziheng, Zheng Lizhai, Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, Xu Zhucheng, Huang Yaomian, Wang Yizhai, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Yunchuan, Zhu Junyun, Bi Mingqi, Tan Zhiqing, Long Yun, and Li Zuoan have lost the legal basis to continue performing their duties as representatives to the National People's Congress. Therefore, the Credentials Committee suggests to the Congress that Zhang Naiqi and the other thirty-eight individuals should not attend the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress. As for the issue of revoking their qualifications as representatives, according to Article 38 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the final decision should be formally made by their original electoral units when they convene. The aforementioned opinions of the Credentials Committee have been endorsed by the 92nd meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the plenary session of the preparatory meeting for the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress.

This report is now submitted to the Congress for consideration.

    新华社1日讯　代表资格审查委员会主任委员马明方，2月1日在第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议上，作了中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会代表资格审查委员会关于补选的代表资格和右派分子章乃器等三十八人的代表资格问题的审查报告，全体通过了这个报告。报告的全文如下：
    全国人民代表大会代表在第四次会议到第五次会议期间逝世的有穆义提、蒉延芳、陈成义、蓝公武、官文森、齐白石、杨刚、简玉阶、王统照、吴焕彧、龙三公
  十一人；撤销代表资格的有右派分子钱端升、沈志远、杨逸棠、江丰、刘兰畦、沙文汉、杨思一、王国松、李士豪、宋云彬、姚顺甫、冯雪峰、曾昭抡、向德、谭惕吾、雷天觉十六人，连同第四次会议以前的缺额五人，应该补选三十二人。在第四次会议到第五次会议期间，浙江省补选了吴宪、俞仲武、俞佐宸、徐赤文、唐巽泽、董聿茂、潘天寿、霍士廉八位代表。代表资格审查委员会根据代表当选证书和其他有关材料，就上述八位代表的代表资格进行了审查。审查结果，认为应该确认他们的代表资格有效。
    代表资格审查委员会同时审查了四川省人民委员会根据四川省人民代表大会的决定而提出的要求撤销右派分子章乃器、潘大逵、曾庶凡三人全国人民代表大会代表资格的报告，广西、旅大、武汉、安徽、江西、江苏、贵州、陕西、山东、福建、甘肃十一个省市人民委员会关于各该省市人民代表大会多数代表要求撤销右派分子黄绍竑、陈铭枢、黄现璠、费振东、乔传珏、马哲民、章伯钧、叶笃义、程士范、潘锷鏱、罗隆基、费孝通、储安平、钱伟长、钱孙卿、欧百川、王天锡、韩兆鹗、丁玲、张东木、谢雪红、杨子恒、郑立斋二十三人全国人民代表大会代表资格的报告，和广东、河南、湖北、天津、云南五个省市人民委员会关于各该省市人民代表大会多数代表要求停止右派分子黄琪翔、李伯球、徐铸成、黄药眠、王毅斋、张轸、张云川、朱君允、毕鸣岐、谭志清、龙云、李琢庵十二人执行全国人民代表大会代表职务的报告。这些报告指出，右派分子章乃器等三十八人反共、反人民、反社会主义的言行，背叛了宪法的根本原则，在政治上丧失了担任全国人民代表大会代表的资格，应予撤销全国人民代表大会代表资格或者停止执行全国人民代表大会代表职务。代表资格审查委员会根据上述各选举单位的人民委员会的报告，经过讨论，认为：右派分子章乃器、潘大逵、曾庶凡、黄绍竑、陈铭枢、黄现璠、费振东、乔传珏、马哲民、章伯钧、叶笃义、程士范、潘锷鏱、罗隆基、费孝通、储安平、钱伟长、钱孙卿、欧百川、王天锡、韩兆鹗、丁玲、张东木、谢雪红、杨子恒、郑立斋、黄琪翔、李伯球、徐铸成、黄药眠、王毅斋、张轸、张云川、朱君允、毕鸣岐、谭志清、龙云、李琢庵已经丧失继续执行全国人民代表大会代表职务的合法根据。因此，代表资格审查委员会建议大会：章乃器等三十八人不应出席第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议；至于撤销他们的代表资格问题，根据中华人民共和国宪法第三十八条的规定，最后应当由他们的原选举单位开会时正式处理。代表资格审查委员会的上述意见，已经得到全国人民代表大会常务委员会第九十二次会议和第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议预备会议全体会议的赞同。
    现在向大会提出报告，请予审议。
