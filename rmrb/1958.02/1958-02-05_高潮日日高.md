　　The surging rectification upsurge and production upsurge have pushed the vast cadres and masses of Hubei Province to a new level. Their level is still continuing to rise, because the rectification and production upsurge is rising day by day.

　　Among the counties in Hubei Province with relatively advanced work in the rectification and production upsurge, there are several, one of which is Hong'an County.

　　When I arrived in Hong'an County, there were many inspiring slogans everywhere. The most attractive slogan read: "Determined to fight hard for ten years to reverse the situation!" This slogan fully demonstrates the revolutionary drive of the people of Hubei Province, especially Hong'an County. This is a great revolutionary heroic spirit that is very worthy of admiration.

　　Hong'an County has formulated a ten-year long-term plan, and the meaning of fighting hard for ten years is to strive to realize and exceed the ten-year long-term plan. However, the natural conditions of Hong'an County are not as good as some neighboring counties. Compared with Macheng, Huangpi, Xiaogan and other counties, the land is much more barren. The total area of the county is about 3.3 million mu, but the arable land is only more than 440,000 mu. Moreover, the soil of the hills is very thin, and many hills have only seven centimeters of soil, with rock underneath. Because of this, Hong'an County has doubled its efforts to change the natural conditions and is determined to reverse the situation.

　　This is one of the old base areas during the land revolution led by our party. In the autumn of 1929, the 11th Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army commanded by Comrade Xu Xiangqian liberated the Huang'an County seat of the old Hubei Province and changed Huang'an's name to Hong'an. The current name of Hong'an County comes from this. At present, 380,000 people in the county have launched a universal rectification and production upsurge. Cadres throughout the county have generally changed their leadership style during the rectification. On this basis, the county party committee proposed a new slogan for developing production: "380,000 people engaged in production, one plan per person, to achieve a double thousand jin for grain and oil." This means that the county should achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin of grain per mu, and 1,000 jin of oil per mu.

　　However, this indicator was immediately broken through when it was brought to the masses. For example, the cadres of Fude Township in Qili District, after discussing the agricultural production increase target for 1958 proposed by the county party committee, expressed their determination to achieve a total of 3,000 jin per mu for grain, peanuts, and other oil crops. Each district and township has proposed new production increase targets and various production increase methods.

　　For the increase in agricultural production, the county party committee proposed three key issues. These are: First, universally build water conservancy and irrigation projects to strive to eliminate drought in 1958. As of January 24, 2,012 medium and small-sized water conservancy projects have been completed in the county, and 1,457 are currently under construction. Second, greatly increase fertilizer, open up fertilizer sources, and strive to accumulate fertilizer. The slogan is: "Pick up all the rice stalks, cut down all the field ridges, and scrape clean the edges of the fields." This way of accumulating fertilizer is both fast and effective, and can also eliminate rice borers. At present, the county has accumulated more than 120 million dan of fertilizer, which is equal to the amount of fertilizer applied in the past year. Before spring plowing, the county will increase fertilizer accumulation by 80 million dan, for a total of 200 million dan, so that this year's spring plowing will have the most superior conditions. Third, conserve water and soil, cultivate thick soil layers, and improve the soil. Plant fruit trees and trees suitable for growth on many sandy hills, pick soil to thicken the overly thin soil on the hills, and increase fertile soil to improve the soil quality. The county held a conference of more than 4,000 people half a month ago, and cadres from districts, townships, cooperatives, and production teams participated. Revolutionary competition conditions were proposed between districts, townships, cooperatives, and teams, letters of determination were written, and actions have already begun.

　　"How is it, are you confident in achieving the plan?" I asked Comrade Guo Jitai, a young director of an agricultural production cooperative and secretary of the branch.

　　"There is no problem in achieving double thousand jin in 1958! There is no problem in eliminating drought!" He gave a very positive and optimistic answer.

　　The agricultural cooperative where Guo Jitai is located is called "Xinghua Township Jiansu Agricultural Production Cooperative," and it is the largest cooperative in the county. The experimental field of Comrade Cheng Peng, the first secretary of the county party committee, is also in this cooperative. The whole cooperative has 1,261 households, 5,708 people; 4,112 mu of paddy fields, 1,711 mu of dry land; divided into ten farming areas, 72 production teams; 1,282 male full laborers, 504 semi-laborers, 442 female full laborers, and 241 semi-laborers. The work progress of this cooperative is very fast, which fully shows the situation of the rising production upsurge of the masses.

　　Although it is currently winter, the so-called slack season for farmers, the current peasant masses have completely turned the winter slack into winter busy. For the great leap forward in production in 1958, the vast number of peasants are stepping up the accumulation of fertilizer and the construction of water conservancy projects, and they are making new achievements every day. According to the statistics of Jiansu Agricultural Cooperative five days ago, the whole cooperative accumulated 504,000 dan of fertilizer. In the past five days, this cooperative has accumulated another 226,000 dan of fertilizer, with an average daily increase of more than 45,000 dan. At present, the total amount of fertilizer accumulated by the whole cooperative is 730,000 dan, which is 50,000 dan more than when rice seedlings were transplanted last year. The cooperative members are proposing from the bottom up to increase fertilizer accumulation to 1 million dan. At the same time, they are building twelve small reservoirs to increase the irrigated area and ensure a new leap forward in agricultural production in 1958.

　　Each township has recently convened mass mobilization meetings, and each agricultural cooperative, each production team, and each individual has mustered their energy and launched a large-scale production competition upsurge. Many agricultural cooperatives have not only mobilized all members to deeply debate and formulate the overall plan for the cooperative, but also have production teams propose specific planning indicators, and each member propose measures to ensure the realization of these indicators. In this way, everyone knows what to do in their hearts, clearly recognizes the goal of struggle, and moves forward courageously without hesitation. They make new achievements every day. Especially due to the leadership of leading cadres, the enthusiasm of the masses for production is constantly increasing.

　　Comrade Cheng Peng, the first secretary of the county party committee, labors in the twilight fields like the male and female members of the agricultural cooperative. In his experimental field, the winter wheat sown in strips is growing lush green, twice as tall as the wheat seedlings sown by Qin Biquan, a well-to-do middle peasant next door. Comrade Cheng Peng applied 160 dan of base fertilizer per mu, and then carried out three top dressings. This has stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses. Production team leader Qin Changqi held a meeting overnight to increase fertilization, reaching 120 dan per mu, plus 50 jin of oil cakes. The high-yield land of this production team yielded 1,256 jin of peanuts and 825 jin of wheat per mu last year; this year, they want to strive for a yield of 1,300 jin of peanuts and 1,000 jin of wheat per mu. They said that this is the result of Comrade Cheng's leadership.

　　The masses have great confidence in Comrade Cheng Peng's experimental field, because the rice he planted in 1957, with early and late cropping, yielded 1,308 jin per mu, and the peanut yield was about 1,500 jin per mu, more than double the yield of ordinary farmers. Therefore, recently, a new ballad has been circulating in the Wufenggang production team of the Jiansu Agricultural Cooperative, which says: "When the secretary takes action, high yields are everywhere, rice is 1,300, and peanuts double." Comrade Cheng Peng also helped them establish and develop orchards and other side businesses. The team members of this production team also composed a song describing the prospects of their production and life. The song writes:

　　"Camellias bloom all over the North Mountain,
　　Golden tangerines in the East Garden,
　　Apples and pears grow around the bay,
　　Flowers and plants in front of the court are fragrant all year round.
　　Grain and oil fill the house,
　　Fish fill the pond,
　　Pigs and sheep fill the pen,
　　Bees are busy everywhere.
　　Every household earns more than a thousand yuan,
　　Everyone's face glows red."

　　Now they have cultivated a large tea mountain, and have also planted 80 tangerine trees and 200 chili trees using Michurin's method. There are also 3,000 apple trees and 1,800 pear trees. They have put forward advanced targets for various sideline productions, and the goal is to ensure that each pig reaches 300 jin. The villages in this area have begun to change their poor past, and the lives of cooperative members have also been significantly improved. Qin Fengjie, a female production team leader, has a family of six. They used to be extremely poor peasants, and their family income has increased year by year since cooperation. In 1957, the family's agricultural income was more than 400 yuan, and the sideline income was more than 200 yuan, totaling more than 600 yuan. She and the production team she leads are constantly increasing their enthusiasm. I saw her plowing on the hill, and she hadn't finished work when it got dark.

　　Due to the continuous high enthusiasm of the cooperative members, many production teams, according to the requirements of the members, hold night shifts every time there is a moonlit night to rush to repair reservoirs and accumulate fertilizer. They sing a short song:

　　"Start work early, finish work late, compete as heroes under the moonlight."

　　In this vigorous production upsurge, how does the leadership work move to the front of the masses? How to keep the enthusiasm of the masses rising? I asked Comrade Cheng Peng these questions. He talked about a few good experiences, which are: First, the ideological style of the leadership must first have a huge leap forward in order to organize a great leap forward in production. Second, everyone must go down and lead the masses among the masses, participate in production wherever they are, and solve problems wherever they are. Third, give great encouragement and support to the advanced new things among the masses. Fourth, seize new things, put forward action slogans, one wave after another, busy but not tired. Fifth, cadres take the lead in focusing on cultivating typical examples, setting examples, and promoting them. Sixth, think more, ask more, study more, consult with the masses more, and summarize the experience of the masses more to improve it. These experiences seem very ordinary to hear, but they are quite difficult to do. I saw from the actual investigation that the Hong'an County Party Committee obtained these experiences from arduous practical work. These experiences have universal significance for party and government agencies across the country to organize and lead the mass production upsurge. I plan to continue to introduce these experiences to readers based on what I have learned from the investigation.

    高潮日日高
　　邓拓
    奔腾澎湃的整改高潮和生产高潮，把湖北省广大的干部和群众推上了新的水平线。他们的水平还在继续提高，因为整改和生产的高潮正在日日高涨。
    在湖北省的整改高潮和生产高潮中，工作比较先进的县份有好几个，其中有一个是红安县。
    当我到达红安县的时候，处处都有许多振奋人心的标语。吸引力最强的一个标语写道：“决心苦战十年，扭转乾坤！”这个标语充分地表现了湖北省的，特别是红安县的人民群众的革命干劲。这是非常值得钦敬的伟大的革命英雄气概。
    红安县制订了十年远景规划，苦战十年的意思就是要为实现和超过十年远景规划而奋斗。但是，红安县的自然条件却不如邻近的一些县份。它同麻城、黄陂、孝感等县比较起来，土地要贫瘠得多了。全县总面积约有三百三十万亩，可耕地只有四十四万多亩。并且山岗的土质很薄，有许多岗地只有七公分的土壤，底下便是岩石。正因为这样，红安县就加倍努力改变自然条件，决心扭转乾坤。
    这里是我们党领导的土地革命时期的老根据地之一。1929年的秋天，徐向前同志指挥的中国工农红军第十一军解放了旧湖北省的黄安县城，把黄安改名为红安。现在红安县的名字就是由此而来的。目前全县三十八万人掀起了普遍的整改和生产的高潮。全县干部在整改中普遍地转变了领导作风。在这个基础上，县委又提出了发展生产的新口号：“三十八万人民搞生产，一人一条计，实现粮食油料双千斤”。这就是说：全县要达到平均粮食亩产一千斤，油料亩产也是一千斤。
    但是，这个指标一拿到群众中去，马上又被突破了。例如七里区福德乡的干部，讨论了县委所提出的1958年的农业增产指标以后，表示决心要做到亩产粮食、花生和其他油料共三千斤。各区、各乡几乎都提出了新的增产指标，并且提出了各种增产的办法。
    为了农业的增产，县委提出了三个关键问题。这就是：第一，普遍建设水利灌溉工程，争取1958年消灭旱灾。截至1月24日，全县中、小型水利已经完成二千零十二处，目前正在施工的还有一千四百五十七处。第二，大量增加肥料，开辟肥源，努力积肥。口号是：“把谷蔸拣净，把田埂砍净，把地边铲净。”这样积肥又多又快，又能消灭螟虫。目前全县积肥已达一亿二千万担以上，等于过去全年的施肥量。在春耕以前，全县还要增加积肥八千万担，共为二亿担，使今年的春耕有最优越的条件。第三，保持水土，培厚土层，改良土壤。在许多砂岗地上栽培适宜生长的果木和树林，挑土加厚土壤过薄的岗地，并且增加肥土，改良土质。全县在半个月以前开了一次四千多人的大会，各区、乡、社和生产队的干部都参加了。区与区、乡与乡、社与社、队与队之间都提出了革命竞赛的条件，写了决心书，并且早已行动起来了。
    “怎么样，实现计划有把握吗？”我问一位年青的农业生产合作社的主任兼支部书记郭继泰同志。
    “1958年实现双千斤没得问题！消灭旱灾也没得问题！”他做了非常肯定的乐观的回答。
    郭继泰所在的农业社名叫“杏花乡建苏农业生产合作社”，是全县最大的一个社。县委第一书记程鹏同志的试验田也在这个社里。全社有一千二百六十一户，五千七百零八人；有水田四千一百一十二亩，旱地一千七百十一亩；分十个耕作区，七十二个生产队；有男子全劳动力一千二百八十二个，半劳动力五百零四个，妇女全劳动力四百四十二个，半劳动力二百四十一个。这个社的工作进度很快，充分表明了群众生产高潮日日高涨的形势。
    目前虽然是冬季，是平常人们所说的农闲季节，但是现在的农民群众却完全把冬闲变成冬忙了。为了1958年的生产大跃进，广大农民正在加紧积肥和兴修水利，他们每日都有新的成绩。建苏农业社在五天以前的统计，全社积肥五十万四千担，最近五天，这个社又积肥二十二万六千担，平均每日增长四万五千担以上。现时全社已经完成的积肥总数字是七十三万担，这比去年插秧的时候增加了五万担。社员们正在自下而上地提出，要增加积肥到一百万担。同时，他们正在兴修十二个小型水库，增加灌溉面积，保证1958年农业生产有一个新的大跃进。
    每个乡最近都召开了群众性的动员大会，每个农业社、每个生产队以及每个人都鼓足了劲头，掀起了大规模的生产竞赛的热潮。许多农业社不但发动全体社员，深入地辩论和制订了全社的规划，并且由各个生产队提出了具体的计划指标，由每个社员提出保证实现这些指标的办法。这样，就使人人心中有数，明确认识奋斗的目标，勇往直前，毫不踌躇。他们每天都做出新的成绩。特别是由于领导干部带头，群众的生产积极性不断地提高。
    县委第一书记程鹏同志，在黄昏的田野里，同农业社的男女社员们一样地劳动。在他的试验田里，条播的冬小麦长得绿油油的，比右邻的富裕中农秦必权点播的麦苗高出一倍。程鹏同志在一亩地里下了一百六十担基肥，又经过了三次追肥。这就激起了群众的干劲。生产队长秦昌祺连夜开会，增加施肥，每亩达到一百二十担，另加五十斤油饼。这个生产队的丰产地去年每亩收下花生一千二百五十六斤，小麦八百二十五斤；今年要争取花生亩产一千三百斤，小麦千斤。他们说，这是程书记带头的结果。
    群众对于程鹏同志的试验田有很高的信心，因为他在1957年种的水稻，早晚连作，亩产一千三百零八斤，花生亩产约一千五百斤，比一般农民的产量多一倍。因此，近来在建苏农业社五峰岗的生产队里，流传着一首新歌谣，它说：“书记动了手，丰产到处有，水稻一千三，花生翻一翻。”程鹏同志还帮助他们建立和发展了果园及其他副业。这个生产队的队员们又编了一首歌，描写他们的生产和生活的远景。这首歌写道：
    “北山茶花遍地开，
    东园蜜桔金黄，
    苹果雪梨围湾长，
    庭前花草四时香。
    粮油满房，
    养鱼满塘，
    猪羊满圈，
    蜜蜂四下忙。
    户户收入千有余，
    人人脸上发红光。”
    现在他们已经培植了很大的一片茶山，又用米丘林的方法栽活了蜜橘八十株，米辣子二百株。还有苹果三千株，梨子一千八百株。他们对各种副业生产分别提出了先进的指标，养猪也要保证每头达到三百斤重。这一带的乡村开始改变了过去穷苦的面貌，社员的生活也有了显明的改善。有一个女生产队长秦凤姐，一家六口，过去是赤贫的农民，合作化以后家庭收入年年增加。1957年全家的农业收入四百多元，副业收入二百多元，共六百多元。她同她所带领的生产队，积极性在不断地提高。我看见她在岗上犁地，天黑了还没有收工。
    由于社员群众的生产热情不断高涨，许多生产队根据社员的要求，每逢有月亮的夜晚就都开夜工，赶修水库和积肥。他们唱着一首短歌：
    “早上工，晚收工，月亮底下比英雄。”
    在这轰轰烈烈的生产高潮中，领导工作怎样走到群众的前面去？怎样使群众的热潮不断地高涨呢？我向程鹏同志提出了这些问题。他谈了几点很好的经验，这就是：第一、领导的思想作风首先要有巨大的跃进，才能组织生产的大跃进。第二、大家都要下去，到群众中去领导群众，人到那里就在那里参加生产，哪里有问题就在哪里解决。第三、对于群众中先进的新事物，要给以大力的鼓励和支持。第四、抓住新鲜事物，提出行动口号，一浪接一浪，忙而不累。第五、干部带头有重点地培养典型，做出榜样，加以推广。第六、多想，多问，多研究，多同群众商量，多总结群众的经验，加以提高。这些经验，听起来似乎很平常，做起来却颇不容易。我从实际考察中看到，红安县委是从艰巨的实际工作中取得这些经验的。这些经验对于全国各地党政机关组织和领导群众生产高潮具有普遍的意义。我打算根据考察所得，继续把这些经验向读者做一些介绍。
