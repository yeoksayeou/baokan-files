Representative Wang Dehou said: After the great blooming and contending at the Beijing Shuangqiao Farm, the number of personnel detached from production was greatly reduced, and a new atmosphere of production innovation emerged in the farm; changing the monthly salary system for some workers to "contracting for work and production, with piecework based on output" increased the income of both the state and individuals; in the anti-waste movement, a new trend of diligence and thrift in running the enterprise emerged at the farm.

I am a worker at the Shuangqiao Farm in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. After listening to the reports of the leaders, I was greatly encouraged. Now, I will report on the situation of our farm's streamlining of personnel detached from production and wage reform.

In our farm, there were many personnel detached from production in the past, accounting for 18 percent of the total number of employees. The institutions were also overlapping, and the procedures for handling affairs were complicated. Many problems could not be solved in a timely manner, which affected the production enthusiasm of the workers. Under the leadership of the Party, in July of last year, with the development of the rectification movement, our farm first convened a representative meeting of employees, launching a movement of great blooming, great contending, great debate, and great change. Many problems were exposed, and many rationalization proposals were put forward, with emphasis on criticizing the idea that "more people make things easier." The institutions were adjusted, and the number of personnel detached from production was reduced from the original 18 percent to 0.75 percent, that is, out of the 400 employees in the entire farm, there were only 6 cadres, and they also participated in half of the labor each year, with only three cadres actually detached from production. Because the leading cadres directly participated in labor and led production, the problems could be solved in a timely manner, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers and masses, and stimulated their minds, creating a lot of production experience. For example, Sun Qingnian, a worker in the dairy cow team, improved the feeding methods, improved the lactation performance of dairy cows after calving, with each cow producing 10,681.82 catties of milk per year, an increase of 31 percent compared with 1956; the workers adopted a layered three-dimensional cage brooding method, which increased the survival rate of chickens by 6.55 percent and increased work efficiency by two times. This is a new phenomenon after the reduction of personnel detached from production.

Through the rectification, our farm also started to reform the wage system for employees. Since the establishment of the farm, a monthly salary system has been implemented, and some workers have the idea that "whether you work or not, you are paid on a monthly basis." This shows that the monthly salary system cannot further adapt to the needs of the great leap in production. After the employee representative meeting, this unreasonable system was first exposed and criticized, and the contradiction between the monthly salary system and the development of production and increased income was resolved. Therefore, the "contracting for work and production, with piecework based on output" method was piloted in the radish and leafy vegetable groups. At the same time, it was stipulated that 70 percent of the guaranteed wage would be paid on a monthly basis, and more would be given for overproduction, and less would be given for reduced production. As a result of the trial implementation, the state's income increased, and each person earned 22 yuan more than the monthly salary system.

Facts have proved that this method not only greatly inspired the production enthusiasm of all employees in the farm, but also promoted the great development of production. This method has been warmly supported by all employees in the farm, and this method will be vigorously promoted this year.

Through rectification, we also waged a tenacious struggle against all wasteful phenomena. The problems exposed showed that the value of wasted, lost, and stockpiled materials in 1957 alone reached more than 50,000 yuan. Now this movement is developing vigorously, and we are determined to burn down all wasteful phenomena. The development of anti-waste has led to a new trend of diligence and thrift. All employees in the farm are trying every means to tap potential and find tricks to save food and funds for the country. Now there are many kinds of livestock substitutes: For example, the workers in the dairy cow feed processing group grind dried alfalfa into powder to replace grain feed. Pig farmers use waste vegetable leaf slurry to replace grain, etc. These two items together can save more than 70,000 catties of grain throughout the year.

Due to the improvement of these tasks and the creativity of the workers, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers has been further encouraged, and income increased in 1957. Last year, more than 60,000 yuan of profits were turned over, which was more than three times higher than in 1956. Although we have made improvements in operation and management, there are still many shortcomings. Under the leadership of the Party, we have full confidence and determination to overcome all shortcomings and difficulties, and strive to realize the great leap in production of our farm in 1958.

    工人干劲足　窍门找得多
    王德厚代表说：北京双桥农场工人，经过大鸣大放后，脱产人员大大减低，农场出现了生产革新的新气象；把一部分工人的月薪制改成“包工包产，以产计件”，国家和个人收入都有了增加；在反浪费运动中，农场出现了勤俭办企业的新风气。
    我是北京东郊双桥农场的工人。听了各位首长的报告，给了我很大的鼓舞。现在，把我们场的精简脱产人员和工资改革的情况汇报一下。
    我们场里，过去脱产人员很多，占全体职工总数的百分之十八，机构上也重叠，办起事来手续繁多，很多问题得不到及时解决，影响了工人生产积极性。在党的领导下，去年七月间，随着整风运动的开展，我场首先召开了职工代表会，掀起了大鸣大放大争大辩和大改的运动，揭发了很多问题，提出了很多合理化建议，并着重批判了“人多好办事”的思想。调整了机构，脱产人员由原来的百分之十八减少到百分之零点七五，也就是在全场四百个职工中，只有干部六人，每年还参加一半劳动，实际脱产干部仅有三人，由于领导干部直接参加劳动领导生产，使问题能够及时得到解决，大大鼓舞了职工群众的干劲，开动了脑筋，创造了不少生产经验。如乳牛队工人孙庆年改进饲养方法，提高了乳牛产后泌能性能，每头牛年产奶一万零六百八十一点八二斤，比一九五六年提高百分之三十一；工人采用了分层立体笼高雏法，鸡的成活率增加百分之六点五五，工作效率提高两倍，这是减少脱产人员后的新气象。
    通过整风，我场对职工的工资制度也着手进行了改革。建场以来就实行了月薪制，有些工人存有“干不干，按月算”的思想。这说明了月薪制不能进一步适应生产大跃进的需要。经过职工代表大会，首先揭发和批判了这种不合理的制度，解决了月薪制与发展生产增加收入的矛盾。因此，在萝?、叶菜两个小组里就试行了“包工包产、以产计件”的办法。同时规定按月发给保证工资百分之七十，另外超产多分，减产少得，试行的结果，国家收入增多了，每人比月薪制也多得了二十二元。
    事实证明，这个办法，不仅大大启发了全场职工生产的积极性，并且促进了生产的大发展。这个办法已经获得全场职工的热烈拥护，今年大力推行这个办法。
    我们通过整风还向一切浪费现象作了顽强的斗争。揭发出来的问题，仅一九五七年就有浪费、损失和积压的物资价值达五万多元。现在这一运动正在热火朝天的向前发展，我们有决心把一切浪费现象烧掉。反浪费的开展，出现了勤俭节约的新风气，全场职工在千方百计挖潜力找窍门来为国家节约粮粮和资财。现在光牲畜代食品就搞了好多种：如奶牛饲料加工组工人把干苜蓿打成粉末代替粮食饲料。养猪工人利用废菜叶粉浆代替粮食等。这两项合起来约计全年可节约粮食七万多斤。
    由于这些工作的改进和工人们的创造，更进一步鼓舞了工人们的革命干劲，一九五七年收入增多了，去年上交利润六万多元，比一九五六年提高了三倍多。我们在经营管理上虽然有了改进，但是也还存有许多缺点，我们在党的领导下完全有信心有决心克服一切缺点和困难，为实现我场一九五八年生产大跃进而努力。
