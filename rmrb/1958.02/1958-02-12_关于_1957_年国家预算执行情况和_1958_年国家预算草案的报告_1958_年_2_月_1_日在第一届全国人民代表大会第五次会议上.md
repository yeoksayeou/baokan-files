Report on the Execution of the 1957 National Budget and the 1958 National Budget Draft

February 1, 1958, at the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress

Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian:

Comrades,

Now, I represent the State Council in presenting the report on the execution of the 1957 national budget and the draft of the 1958 national budget for your review.

(I) Execution of the 1957 National Budget

The execution of the 1957 national budget was excellent. The completion of the 1957 national financial revenue and expenditure plan not only ensured the completion of the construction plan for the last year of the First Five-Year Plan but also powerfully demonstrated the strong vitality of the socialist system, refuting the slander by right-wing capitalist elements against our country's financial and economic situation. At the end of 1956 and the beginning of 1957, due to the tight supply of certain materials and the occurrence of significant natural disasters in agriculture in 1956, our country's financial and economic situation encountered some temporary and partial difficulties. Right-wing elements rejoiced at this misfortune. However, just as in all other matters, the right-wing elements' bets were completely wrong, and moreover, we should thank them because the poisonous weeds turned into fertilizer, their attacks greatly helped to raise the awareness of the working people, thereby greatly promoting the surge of the production and savings movement. The execution of the 1957 national budget resulted in revenue exceeding expenditure, and revenue was greater than expenditure. It should be said that the 1957 national finances achieved remarkable and inspiring results.

The 1957 national final accounts will take some time to compile, and currently, only the preliminary execution figures of the national budget can be reported to the Congress. According to preliminary estimates, the main situation of the 1957 national financial revenue and expenditure is as follows.

Regarding revenue: The original budget for 1957 was 293.94 billion yuan, the actual revenue was 307.02 billion yuan, which is 104.45% of the original budget, an increase of 6.81% over 1956. According to the preliminary execution figures, in 1957, the national budget revenue was as follows: various taxes amounted to 154.39 billion yuan, which is 105.24% of the original budget; enterprise and institutional income amounted to 142.21 billion yuan, which is 104.03% of the original budget; debt income amounted to 6.73 billion yuan, which is 107.99% of the original budget; other income amounted to 3.69 billion yuan, which is 92% of the original budget.

Regarding expenditure: The original budget for 1957 was 293.94 billion yuan, the actual expenditure was 305.49 billion yuan, which is 103.93% of the original budget, roughly the same as the expenditure in 1956. According to the preliminary execution figures, in 1957, the national budget expenditure was as follows: economic construction expenditure amounted to 148.61 billion yuan, which is 108.36% of the original budget; social and cultural expenditure amounted to 47.39 billion yuan, which is 98.01% of the original budget; defense expenditure amounted to 55.09 billion yuan, which is 99.74% of the original budget; administrative management expenditure amounted to 23.22 billion yuan, which is 94.96% of the original budget; debt and foreign aid expenditure amounted to 12.93 billion yuan, which is 96.71% of the original budget; other expenditure amounted to 1.99 billion yuan, which is 72.27% of the original budget; additional bank credit funds and repayment of 1956 overdrafts amounted to 15.53 billion yuan (including 9.53 billion yuan of additional bank credit funds from the surplus of revenue over expenditure), which is 258.83% of the original budget; in addition, 730 million yuan was added to the local budget turnover fund. In 1957, the completion of basic construction investment was 119.05 billion yuan (if the basic construction investment carried out with self-raised funds by various parties is included, it is 123.7 billion yuan), which is 107.25% of the original plan.

It should be noted that due to the development of the production and savings movement in 1957, financial revenue exceeded the original plan, while many aspects of expenditure were reduced compared to the original plan. Based on this situation, the state, in the second half of 1957, added 13.4 billion yuan to the expenditure in stages. This part of the expenditure was mainly used for basic construction. Despite this, the state's financial revenue in 1957 still exceeded expenditure by 1.1 billion yuan. This surplus, excluding the 1.53 billion yuan surplus belonging to the local budget that remains with the local authorities, the 9.53 billion yuan surplus belonging to the central budget has been allocated as credit funds to the banks and included in the 1957 expenditure items.

The victory of the 1957 national financial work was achieved on the basis of the production and savings movement led by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement and the struggle against the rightists throughout the country. The broad masses of workers and economic workers enthusiastically responded to the call by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in early 1957 for increased production and savings, and frugal construction. The vigorous socialist revolutionary movement on the ideological and political fronts that began in May further raised the production and savings movement to a higher level step by step.

In the industrial sector, the broad masses of workers, through the struggle against the rightists and the rectification movement, greatly enhanced their class consciousness and revolutionary initiative, thereby increasing labor productivity, strengthening labor discipline, and significantly improving the attendance rate of most enterprises compared to the past. Through the active efforts of the workers, the total industrial output value for the country in 1957 is expected to reach 628.1 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan by 4.1% and increasing by 6.9% over 1956. Many basic construction units, in accordance with the principles of frugal management of enterprises and frugal management of all undertakings, reviewed and revised design documents, reduced non-production investments, modified some overly high and inappropriate design standards, and, under the premise of ensuring quality, reduced construction costs. The review and revision of the design of 91 projects by the six industrial ministries under the central government alone saved 4 billion yuan, part of which has been saved in the construction process in 1957, and the rest will be saved in the subsequent construction process.

In the agricultural sector, the agricultural production cooperatives across the country, by implementing the principles of frugal management and democratic management, improved management, and despite the occurrence of floods and droughts in some areas, agricultural production still achieved a good harvest, especially cotton. The total agricultural and sideline output value for the country in 1957 reached 603.5 billion yuan, an increase of 26.6 billion yuan over the previous year. Through the great debate, criticism of the capitalist road, and in-depth socialist education in the countryside, the cooperatives were further consolidated, and farmers' understanding of the unified purchase and supply policy for important agricultural products was greatly enhanced, which played a significant role in the smooth implementation of the state's agricultural product procurement plan in 1957. The state's agricultural loan issuance quota in 1957 increased by 3 billion yuan compared to 1956, but due to farmers' attention to saving and timely repayment of loans, the amount of loans remaining with farmers at the end of 1957 was approximately 2.7 billion yuan less than the same period in 1956.

In the transportation, commerce, and other sectors, the production and savings movement and the rectification movement also played a positive role in the over-fulfillment of the 1957 budget.

In improving budget management and saving state agency funds, 1957 saw significant progress. Various departments strictly controlled personnel quotas and wage standards, implemented regulations against arbitrary increases in personnel and wage benefits. Many departments, for temporary expenditures, mostly resolved them within their own budget scope, thereby saving state funds. The expenditure on defense and administrative management was reduced by more than 1.37 billion yuan compared to the original plan and by 9.45 billion yuan compared to the expenditure in 1956.

All of this demonstrates the significant role of the production and savings movement and the rectification movement in the execution results of the 1957 national budget. These two movements are now developing on a larger scale. Undoubtedly, they will have an even greater impact on the execution of the 1958 national budget.

At the Fourth Session of this Congress in July 1957, we reported that the execution results of the 1957 budget should not only achieve a surplus of revenue over expenditure but also reduce the circulation of currency in the market and increase the stock of commodities. These requirements have now been met.

According to statistics from the People's Bank, by the end of 1957, the circulation of currency in the market, under the condition of ensuring the turnover of commodities, was reduced by 4.5 billion yuan compared to the end of 1956. In 1957, due to the over-fulfillment of the production plan by the industrial sector and the expansion of procurement by the commercial sector under the condition of a good agricultural harvest, the commercial sector's borrowing from the bank exceeded the original plan by 34.6 billion yuan. In addition, the commercial sector also withdrew 5 billion yuan from the bank. The total of these two items is 39.6 billion yuan. However, the execution result of the bank's credit plan still achieved credit income greater than credit expenditure. This is because, based on the production and savings movement, the 1957 national budget had a surplus of revenue over expenditure, with a considerable part of the surplus allocated to the bank, and the savings deposits of urban and rural residents also increased significantly. Farmers also repaid a considerable amount of due loans. The bank's credit income being greater than credit expenditure, coupled with the expansion of the non-cash settlement part in the countryside in 1957 (agricultural cooperatives deposited cash in the bank, and large-scale expenditures were transferred through the bank without withdrawing cash), the circulation of currency in the market was reduced compared to the previous year.

At the same time, due to the development of the production and savings movement and the good situation of agricultural product procurement, and because the 1957 national budget had a surplus of revenue over expenditure, bank credit income and expenditure far exceeded the plan, the stock of national commodities also increased significantly. By the end of 1957, the stock of major national materials increased by about 50 billion yuan compared to the same period in 1956. Among these, the stock of various industrial departments increased by about 15 billion yuan, and the stock of various commercial departments (including raw materials prepared for industrial production) increased by about 35 billion yuan. Thus, the stock of national commodities, which had once decreased in 1956, has been replenished and even exceeded, the tense situation of market supply has been eased, and at the same time, a part of the national material reserves has been increased, which is necessary. Now, the stock has not increased for only a few commodities such as sugar and edible oil, and it is still necessary to increase production to further improve the supply situation.

The development of the production and savings movement and the increase in the stock of national commodities ensured the stability of market prices. At the beginning of 1957, the state, to promote the development of the production of certain agricultural and sideline products, actively raised their procurement and sales prices; at the same time, to adjust the supply and demand relationship, it also raised the sales prices of some high-end consumer goods. However, due to the smooth implementation of the predetermined requirements in finance, bank credit, material supply, and other aspects, the prices in 1957 remained basically stable. Many important daily necessities for the people did not increase in price. The prices of commodities that did increase accounted for a very small proportion of the total retail sales of social commodities. Since June of last year, prices have remained stable. The adjustment of agricultural and sideline product prices benefited farmers and handicraft laborers, thereby significantly promoting the production of these products. For example, in 1956, there were only 97.8 million pigs nationwide, but in 1957, there were 1.2777 billion, an increase of over 30% compared to 1956.

The execution of the 1957 national budget proves that in all financial and economic work, we must fully recognize the great role of the human factor and the political factor, and fully recognize the great role of the revolutionary initiative of the working people under the new socialist production relations. Fully recognizing these roles will enable us to maintain full confidence, firmness, and revolutionary enthusiasm in the face of any difficulties.

Politics serves the economic base, it is the guarantee of economic work, and at the same time, it is the commander and soul of economic work and all other work. As Chairman Mao said: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. In periods of change in the social economic system, it is even more so."

When the financial and economic situation encountered some temporary and partial difficulties in the winter of 1956, we once made some inappropriate assessments of certain individual problems in financial and economic work (such as spending more money on basic construction). However, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao immediately pointed out the correct direction to us, telling us to distinguish between the main and secondary aspects, essence and phenomena, and instructing us that as long as we resolutely mobilize the masses to launch the production and savings movement, the difficulties at that time would definitely show significant improvement in a few months. The development of the financial and economic situation in 1957 fully proved the correctness of this foresight. This is a valuable lesson for all government workers, especially financial and economic workers.

1957 was the last year of our country's First Five-Year Plan. When we review the execution of the 1957 national budget, we should briefly review the national finances over the entire five years.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, the total financial revenue was 1,365.62 billion yuan (excluding the major repair funds and enterprise reward funds of enterprise units), and the total financial expenditure was 1,364.09 billion yuan, with revenue exceeding expenditure by 1.53 billion yuan. Compared to the original five-year financial plan, the five-year financial revenue was 104.2% of the original plan of 1,309.41 billion yuan, and the five-year financial expenditure was 106.4% of the original plan of 1,282.06 billion yuan.

In the five-year financial expenditure, the total basic construction investment was 487.7 billion yuan, which is 114.12% of the original basic construction investment plan of 427.4 billion yuan.

The composition of financial revenue and expenditure has undergone significant changes over the five years, along with the changes in the overall national economic situation. In 1952, the national revenue from socialist economic sectors such as state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative enterprises accounted for 60.1% of the total revenue, while in 1957, this increased to 95%. The proportion from other sources in the total revenue has become very small. In terms of expenditure, the proportion of state construction expenditure (including economic construction and cultural education construction) in the total expenditure increased from 59% in 1952 to 64.17% in 1957, while the proportion of national institution expenditure (including defense expenditure and administrative management expenditure) decreased from 36.3% in 1952 to 25.63% in 1957.

It is clear that during the First Five-Year Plan period, our country's financial strength has grown and been consolidated. The First Five-Year financial plan was basically appropriate, its implementation not only ensured the completion of the First Five-Year Plan but also laid a good foundation for the finances of the Second Five-Year Plan period.

(II) Arrangement of the 1958 National Budget

1958 is the first year of our country's Second Five-Year Construction Plan and will also be a year when the great national rectification movement demonstrates its astonishing revolutionary power in all aspects. The people of the entire country, in order to build our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as quickly as possible, are actively working to implement the policy of developing socialist construction in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical. They strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the production of steel and other major industrial products within the next fifteen years or so, strive to implement the National Agricultural Development Outline (Draft) ahead of schedule, and strive to catch up with or reach the world's advanced level in urgently needed scientific and technological fields within a relatively short period.

The current international situation is very favorable for this historic effort by our people. 1957 was a new turning point in world politics, and the truth that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind is now clearer than ever. The strength of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union is growing, the strength of the international proletariat is growing, and the strength of international forces advocating peace is growing, while the imperialist bloc led by the United States is becoming increasingly chaotic and passive. It is clear that the sooner we build socialism, the more we can contribute to world peace.

As everyone knows, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, our country's industry and agriculture will undergo significant development. Currently, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and all laboring people, under the slogans of "Three years to see the results, one year to see the results" and "Struggle for three years," are welcoming the 1958 national economic plan with unprecedented enthusiasm. They demand that 1958 make a big leap forward in all fronts to lay a superior foundation for the Second Five-Year Plan. In all parts of the country, advanced indicators are being continuously realized and broken, and advanced experiences are being continuously created and promoted. The entire nation is spirited, full of vitality, and everyone is swept up in the competition to catch up with the advanced and further advance, hoping to fundamentally change the appearance of most parts of our country in the shortest possible time. Under these circumstances, the national economy in 1958 is fully capable of achieving a new leap forward.

To adapt to this situation, the 1958 national budget is a budget that opposes conservatism, actively taps potential, and has relatively rapid growth in both revenue and expenditure. It is a budget that implements the spirit of rectification, firmly opposes waste, and firmly reduces non-production expenditures. It is a budget that actively increases production expenditures, actively develops basic construction, and strongly supports agriculture. To mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, starting from 1958, the financial management system has also been improved, and the authority of local financial management and enterprise financial management has been expanded. This issue will be explained later.

The 1958 national budget revenue is 336.3 billion yuan, and the budget expenditure is 336.3 billion yuan, with revenue and expenditure balanced. Compared to the 1957 preliminary execution figures, according to the 1958 budget compilation method, revenue increased by 22.42 billion yuan, an increase of 7.27%; expenditure increased by 23.95 billion yuan, an increase of 7.81%.

Is the growth of the 1958 budget revenue reliable? We believe it is. As mentioned earlier, the enthusiasm for increased production and savings among the workers, peasants, and all laboring people across the country has reached an unprecedented level through the rectification movement. In addition to this most fundamental favorable condition, the following points must also be noted: first, most of the construction projects completed during the First Five-Year Plan period will reach their designed production capacity in 1958. In addition, there will be a batch of new enterprises put into production in 1958. The 1957 harvest of agricultural products, especially cotton and sugar cane, was good, which is beneficial for the development of light industry in 1958 and the increase in industrial and commercial income. Due to the large-scale agricultural production movement across the country since the winter of 1957, the agricultural output in 1958 will have a significant increase, and various large, medium, and small water conservancy projects will undoubtedly strengthen the agricultural production's ability to resist disasters. Due to all these factors, we believe that the 1958 budget revenue plan can not only be completed but also can strive to be over-fulfilled.

The 1958 national budget revenue by category is as follows:

1. Various taxes amount to 164.97 billion yuan, accounting for 49.9% of the budget revenue, which is 106.85% of the 1957 preliminary execution figures. Among these, industrial and commercial taxes amount to 123.9 billion yuan, which is 109.6% of the previous year; agricultural taxes amount to 29.97 billion yuan, which is 102.25% of the previous year.

2. Enterprise and institutional income amounts to 157.16 billion yuan, accounting for 46.73% of the budget revenue, which is 108.95% of the previous year. Among these, the income of various industrial departments amounts to 75.1 billion yuan, which is 115.11% of the previous year; the income of departments such as railways, transportation, and postal services amounts to 23.88 billion yuan, which is 104.87% of the previous year; the income of departments such as commerce and foreign trade amounts to 46.35 billion yuan, which is 106.86% of the previous year.

3. Debt income amounts to 6.3 billion yuan, all of which is domestic bond income, accounting for 1.91% of the budget revenue, which is 93.59% of the previous year.

4. Other income amounts to 2.2 billion yuan, accounting for 0.66% of the budget revenue, which is 77.54% of the previous year.

Here, it should be noted that the agricultural tax revenue in 1958 has slightly increased. The agricultural tax revenue listed in the budget is 29.97 billion yuan, an increase of 660 million yuan compared to 1957, equivalent to 7.7 billion jin of fine grains. The agricultural tax fiscal year starts from each autumn, different from the tax year starting from the beginning of the year. If calculated by the tax year, the summer and autumn collection of fine grains in 1957 was 348 billion jin, and the estimated summer and autumn collection of fine grains in 1958 is 362 billion jin. The increase in the figure for 1958 compared to 1957 is not 7.7 billion jin but 14 billion jin. Due to the increase in the main tax of agricultural tax and the increase in the surcharge rate of agricultural tax in regions with relatively large profits, it is estimated that the agricultural tax surcharge will increase by 4 billion jin. The total increase in the main tax and surcharge is 18 billion jin, an increase of 4.57% over the collection amount of the previous year.

Since 1952, the burden of agricultural tax in our country has been basically stable for five years, and agricultural production has developed to a considerable extent during this period. In 1958, on the basis of continued development of production, it is appropriate to increase some tax revenue, and farmers will agree to this. All patriotic farmers understand that the more and faster the state's socialist construction is carried out, the greater and earlier the benefits farmers will receive; as long as the state's construction needs it, farmers are willing to contribute more in the situation of increased production and income. However, to further encourage farmers' enthusiasm for increased production, agricultural tax collection should not be changed too frequently. In his report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao announced that within a few years, the state will stabilize the amount of grain procurement and purchase at around 800 billion jin. This means that, in addition to purchasing over 500 billion jin of grain, the amount of grain procurement will not exceed 300 billion jin in a few years. We plan to slightly increase the procurement figure this year and then, like in previous years, stabilize it for five years without change. In fact, although the procurement figure in 1958 has increased slightly, due to the estimated increase in agricultural output by 7% over the previous year (if including agricultural and sideline output value, the estimated increase is 6.1% over the previous year), the proportion of agricultural tax in agricultural output will decrease from 11.3% of the previous year to 11.06%; if the output increases more, this proportion will decrease even more. In the next five years, with the agricultural tax remaining stable and unchanged, this proportion will continue to decrease.

Regarding the agricultural tax collection method, in the 1957 budget report presented at the previous session, it was mentioned that, based on the new situation after the realization of agricultural cooperation, necessary modifications should be made. In the past, agricultural tax was levied per household, but in the future, it will be levied per agricultural cooperative. In the past, some regions implemented a proportional tax system, while others implemented a progressive tax system, but in the future, a proportional tax system will be implemented nationwide. Furthermore, the taxable output and tax rate of agricultural tax will also be adjusted and revised based on the new situation. After multiple studies, the draft of the new agricultural tax regulations has been prepared and will soon be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for approval to be implemented on a trial basis. After one year of trial implementation, it will be revised and submitted to the National People's Congress for approval to be officially promulgated and implemented.

Here, it is also necessary to explain that in 1958, some reforms to the industrial and commercial tax system will be implemented. The main content of the reforms is to change the current method of multiple taxes and multiple levies, and to merge the existing commodity circulation tax, commodity tax, business tax, stamp tax, and other four types of taxes, simplifying the tax payment procedures. The reform bill will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for approval. With the improvement of the financial system, in 1958, it is also necessary to improve the tax administration system, transferring some tax administration authorities that can be handled by local authorities to the local authorities. Local authorities will handle these according to the needs of local economic development and actual situations, making the national tax system better serve the development of production and the consolidation of the socialist economy. It is estimated that after these measures are implemented, there will be some changes between the tax revenue targets and enterprise income targets, and also some changes between the central financial revenue and local financial revenue. Corresponding adjustments will be needed during the budget execution process.

The 1958 national budget expenditure by category is as follows:

1. Economic construction expenditure amounts to 175.48 billion yuan, accounting for 52.07% of the budget expenditure, which is 117.28% of the preliminary execution figures of the previous year. Among these, industrial expenditure amounts to 91.69 billion yuan, which is 113.07% of the previous year; agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy expenditure amounts to 29.4 billion yuan, which is 140.78% of the previous year; railway, transportation, and postal expenditure amounts to 25.4 billion yuan, which is 114.47% of the previous year; commercial, grain, and foreign trade expenditure amounts to 2.79 billion yuan, which is 76.33% of the previous year.

2. Social and cultural expenditure amounts to 48.96 billion yuan, accounting for 14.81% of the budget expenditure, which is 102.85% of the previous year. Among these, cultural expenditure amounts to 2.08 billion yuan, which is 112.19% of the previous year; primary and secondary education expenditure amounts to 22.53 billion yuan, which is 102.21% of the previous year; higher education expenditure amounts to 5.99 billion yuan, which is 96.67% of the previous year; scientific expenditure amounts to 3.84 billion yuan, which is 131.3% of the previous year; medical expenditure amounts to 5.49 billion yuan, which is 108.99% of the previous year; relief and welfare expenditure amounts to 5.4 billion yuan, which is 91.36% of the previous year.

3. Defense expenditure amounts to 50 billion yuan, accounting for 15.12% of the budget expenditure, which is 90.76% of the previous year.

4. Administrative management expenditure amounts to 20 billion yuan, accounting for 6.05% of the budget expenditure, which is 86.13% of the previous year.

5. Debt expenditure amounts to 10.31 billion yuan, accounting for 3.12% of the budget expenditure, which is 123.01% of the previous year.

6. Foreign aid expenditure amounts to 4.14 billion yuan, accounting for 1.25% of the budget expenditure, which is 91.16% of the previous year.

7. Other expenditure amounts to 2.83 billion yuan, accounting for 0.86% of the budget expenditure, which is 144.69% of the previous year.

8. Additional bank credit funds amount to 8 billion yuan, accounting for 2.42% of the budget expenditure.

9. Total reserve funds amount to 10.91 billion yuan, accounting for 3.3% of the budget expenditure.

Regarding the arrangement of the 1958 national budget expenditure, the following points need to be explained:

1. In the 1958 national budget expenditure, the proportion of economic construction expenditure and social and cultural expenditure will increase from 64.17% in 1957 to 67.88%, while the proportion of defense expenditure and administrative management expenditure will decrease from 25.63% in 1957 to 21.17%. Comparing the absolute figures of the two years, the economic construction expenditure in 1958 will increase by 25.86 billion yuan; the social and cultural expenditure will increase by 1.35 billion yuan; the defense expenditure will decrease by 5.09 billion yuan; the administrative management expenditure will decrease by 3.22 billion yuan. The changes in the 1958 budget arrangement indicate that the national budget expenditure is continuously reducing non-production expenditures and increasing production expenditures. This is completely necessary for the rapid, good, and economical development of socialist construction.

A significant feature of the 1958 national budget of our country is the significant reduction of defense and administrative management expenditures. Unlike the military expansion and war preparation budgets of the United States and other imperialist countries, our country's defense and administrative expenditures not only further reduce their proportion in the national budget but also significantly reduce their absolute figures. What does this fact show? It fully shows the ardent desire of our people to engage in peaceful labor and the determination of our government to tighten state institution expenditures to accelerate the development of socialist construction.

The reduction of state institution expenditures does not mean the weakening of their work, but rather, it will be beneficial to the strengthening of their work. This reduction not only has significant economic implications but also more significant political implications. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have called on our state workers to eliminate bureaucratism and blend in with the working people, appearing before them as ordinary laborers. Extravagance and waste are important signs of bureaucratism, and to eliminate bureaucratism, we must thoroughly eliminate extravagance and waste. Our government is the people's government, and our army is the people's army. We should have the ambition and determination to do the most with the least money, making our government and army the most ideal government and army serving the people.

2. In the 1958 national budget expenditure, the investment in basic construction amounts to 138.36 billion yuan. Most of these investments are used for economic construction; the basic construction in social and cultural and administrative management has been reduced compared to 1957.

In addition to the aforementioned 138.36 billion yuan for basic construction in 1958, there is also basic construction investment of approximately 7.41 billion yuan arranged by state-owned enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives with their own funds and other basic construction investments. If these investments are added together, then the total basic construction investment for the country in 1958 will reach 145.77 billion yuan, an increase of 22.07 billion yuan, or 17.8% over 1957. The basic construction investment in 1958 has increased significantly, on the one hand, due to the increase in financial revenue, and on the other hand, due to the tightening of military and political expenditures and other expenditures.

In 1958, there will be 1,185 construction projects above the designated scale starting or continuing construction. In addition, the state has prepared several basic construction reserve projects. During the budget execution process, as long as revenue exceeds the plan and expenditure is reduced, and the raw material industry increases production and savings, basic construction investment can be timely increased, striving for some reserve projects to be constructed this year.

In the allocation of basic construction investment in 1958, the investment in basic construction in social and cultural and administrative management has been reduced, while the investment in basic construction in economic construction has been increased. In the investment in economic construction, the needs of key construction projects are first ensured, and at the same time, the investment in agriculture, water conservancy, chemical fertilizer industry, agricultural machinery industry, and other weak links that are urgently needed is significantly increased, and the investment in fuel industry, power industry, raw material industry, and other urgently needed machinery industries is appropriately increased.

To further save funds in the planning and execution of budgets, and to allocate more funds for construction projects, the state has mandated that in 1958, based on the established plan, costs must be further reduced by 7% to 10% while ensuring the quality of the projects. Specifically, the requirement is to reduce the total investment in basic construction by 7% to 10% based on the already determined amount. The saved funds will still be allocated by various departments and regions for other construction expenditures.

(3) In 1958, the state's financial support for agricultural production will be significantly increased compared to previous years. The state budget allocates 2.94 billion yuan for agriculture, an increase of 852 million yuan from 1957, a growth of 40.78%. This includes 2.069 billion yuan for basic construction in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, and 871 million yuan for operational expenses and additional working capital in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy. Apart from the direct expenditures on agriculture, the 1958 state budget also increases expenditures on chemical fertilizer industry, agricultural machinery industry, and other sectors related to agricultural production. Additionally, the state supports agriculture through loans and pre-purchasing agricultural products. In 1958, the state plans to issue 4.4 billion yuan in agricultural loans, an increase of 400 million yuan from 1957. The state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives will issue 1.1 billion yuan in pre-purchase deposits for agricultural products, an increase of 500 million yuan from the actual issuance in 1957. The total financial support for agriculture through credit methods in 1958 will be 9 billion yuan more than in 1957.

It must be pointed out that the funds needed for production and construction in agriculture, unlike in industry, mainly rely on the accumulation of agricultural production cooperatives themselves. State financial support for agriculture is necessary; otherwise, it would be impossible to solve problems related to large-scale water conservancy projects, chemical fertilizer industry, agricultural machinery industry, and other issues requiring concentrated investment of large amounts of funds. However, this does not mean that the accumulation of farmers themselves can be placed in the second position. According to preliminary estimates, if all agricultural cooperatives in the country set aside 8% of their agricultural and sideline income after deducting production costs as public accumulation, the total public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives in 1958 could reach around 3 billion yuan. To meet the needs of further expanding reproduction, the state has recently decided to appropriately increase the proportion of public accumulation in agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, the total public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives in the future could be even larger. Moreover, in agricultural production and construction, the decisive factor is still the labor force of the vast number of farmers. China has over 500 million farmers, which is an immense labor resource. Most of the basic construction in agriculture consists of medium and small-scale projects. With labor, the main guarantee is secured, and China's farmers have relatively abundant labor. In the past, during the off-season, farmers had surplus labor. Now, we need to turn the off-season into a busy season, and on a large scale in agriculture, to carry out basic construction, the main hope lies here. Many facts have proven that in a socialist society, as long as we seriously rely on and mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the farmers, organize farmers to engage in planned labor to conquer nature, and provide necessary technical guidance, the state does not need to spend much money to significantly increase agricultural production. In the winter of 1957, due to the issuance of the "Outline for Agricultural Development" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the joint issuance of the decision on water conservancy and fertilizer by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the production enthusiasm of farmers across the country was greatly inspired. In recent times, millions of farmers, working day and night, braving the cold, with a heroic spirit of moving mountains and reversing rivers, have launched a fiery movement to build agricultural water conservancy. From October last year to mid-January this year, the number of farmers working on water conservancy projects nationwide was about 100 million per day. Calculating 100 million people working for 100 days, the labor invested by farmers in water conservancy construction has already reached 10 billion labor days. If each labor day is valued at 0.6 yuan on average, farmers have already invested 6 billion yuan. Of course, the wealth created by 10 billion labor days will far exceed this amount, and the benefits of these water conservancy projects will be immeasurable. This movement is still continuing, and the facts have already shown that this year's water conservancy construction will far exceed the plan. In such a large-scale construction movement, farmers do not need the state to spend much money. This is not a clear indication that once the enthusiasm of the masses is organized and mobilized, many major problems can be solved by themselves? Therefore, with the investment of the labor force of the vast number of farmers and the accumulation of public funds, coupled with the active support of the state, as long as it is used appropriately, the funds needed for the rapid development of agriculture can be fully solved.

(4) In 1958, the state budget expenditures for operational expenses total 5.819 billion yuan, an increase of 267 million yuan from 1957, a growth of 4.81%. Operational expenses are the main expenditures in the state budget, excluding basic construction, working capital, and military and political expenses. The 1958 operational expenses are categorized as follows: (1) Operational expenses for industry and transportation, including survey and design, waterway maintenance, road maintenance, etc., totaling 635 million yuan; (2) Operational expenses for agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, including technical promotion, animal husbandry and veterinary, forest protection, soil conservation, and subsidies for rural water conservancy, totaling 838 million yuan; (3) State mapping, urban public utilities, etc., totaling 162 million yuan (the above three categories are classified as economic construction expenses in the state budget); (4) Operational expenses for culture and education, including primary, secondary, and higher education, technical education, scientific research, publishing, broadcasting, etc., totaling 3.198 billion yuan; (5) Operational expenses for health, including maternal and child health, epidemic prevention, public medical treatment, etc., totaling 449 million yuan; (6) Operational expenses for relief and subsidies, totaling 537 million yuan (the above three categories are classified as social and cultural expenses in the state budget).

The above figures for various operational expenses have already undergone initial compression. We believe that in the process of budget execution, through mass debate and practice, further savings can be made in some areas. Why? Because currently, there are many wasteful practices in operational expenses. Various types of institutions and units that rely on operational expenses for maintenance and development are scattered across cities and countryside, numerous and extensive. Many of these institutions have complex systems, overlapping structures, and poor financial management. If we vigorously implement streamlining and savings, we can definitely save a significant amount of funds. The nature of different institutions varies. Some institutions need state investment to actively develop, and even these institutions must save on the use of funds. As for general education, health care, small-scale water conservancy, rural roads and bridges, etc., they inherently have the nature of public welfare and should be promoted to be self-sufficient or jointly funded by the public and the government, rather than entirely funded by the state. Some things can be done better by the masses themselves and may be more suitable for the needs of the masses. Whether these institutions are operated by the state or the masses, they cannot be detached from the current level of production development and the living standards of the people. Wherever possible, we should make do with what we have, strive to spend less and achieve more. The reduction of operational expenses mainly relies on streamlining organizations, reducing personnel, and lowering expenditure standards. The wages of personnel will generally not be reduced. The Ministry of Finance and other relevant departments have not paid enough attention to the management of operational expenses in the past. In the future, during the budget execution process, we must continue to work hard to reduce expenses.

(5) In 1958, the state budget expenditures for increasing working capital for enterprises total 700 million yuan. At the same time, the bank credit plan also includes an increase of 2.66 billion yuan in loans to enterprises. The two combined, the working capital for enterprises in 1958 will increase by a total of 2.76 billion yuan. This includes an increase of 1.16 billion yuan for industrial working capital, 1.467 billion yuan for commercial working capital, and 133 million yuan for working capital in agriculture and transportation enterprises, etc. China's industrial production and commodity circulation are expanding every year, and in 1958, they will expand even more. To ensure that enterprises do not interrupt production and maintain normal turnover, it is necessary to increase such working capital. However, it must be admitted that there are still serious shortcomings in the management and use of working capital, mainly high quotas, excessive occupation, and slow turnover. To save on the use of funds, we are studying effective measures to strengthen the management of working capital and have decided to take the following steps starting in 1958: (1) The quota working capital for central industries, which was previously entirely funded by the state budget without interest, will be changed to mostly funded by the budget and partly by bank loans. (2) The interest rate for industrial loans to banks, which was previously 0.48% per month, will be changed to the same as for commerce, 0.6% per month. (3) The quota working capital for local enterprises, which was previously basically solved by financial allocations, will be changed according to the regulations for improving the financial management system, to be partly solved by local finances and partly by bank loans. In addition, for commercial enterprises, we are also studying the regulation of inventory quotas and proposing measures to strengthen the management of working capital. All the above measures aim to promote enterprises to strengthen economic accounting, save on the use of working capital, and strengthen the supervision of local governments over bank credit plans, so as to strengthen the management and supervision of working capital from both the budget and credit aspects. Working capital is an important aspect of national fund allocation. Saving on working capital not only means reducing unnecessary reserves for enterprises, shortening the production cycle of enterprises, and improving the management level of enterprises; it also means freeing up a lot of money to increase basic construction and accelerate the development of the national economy. China's working capital increases by tens of billions of yuan every year, but the management of working capital is still a weak link in financial work. The Ministry of Finance, banks, and enterprise management departments must actively work to improve this situation.

(3) Improvements in the Financial System in 1958

Based on the experience of the First Five-Year Plan, the government has decided to make several major improvements to the financial management system, which have been approved by the 84th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and will be implemented starting in 1958. These improvements aim to adjust the relationship between the central government and local governments, and between the state and enterprises in financial matters; to better combine the principles of unified leadership and local conditions; to better combine the interests of the whole with the interests of the parts, so as to fully mobilize all positive factors and more effectively serve the construction of socialism. In addition, the management of agricultural loans will also be improved this year. The following is a brief explanation.

(1) Improving the Financial Management System

In the past few years, the management methods for local finances have essentially been to collect revenues upwards and allocate expenditures downwards, making it difficult for local governments to arrange their revenues and expenditures according to local conditions and comprehensively. Some special expenditure needs of local governments sometimes could not be solved or could not be solved in a timely manner. Moreover, after the budget was determined, increased revenues and saved expenditures often could not be used by local governments, thus limiting the initiative of local governments to some extent. Although some improvements have been made to the financial system in the past few years, such as expanding the authority of local governments to adjust expenditures and allowing local governments to use part of the surplus from the previous year, the above situation has not been fundamentally changed.

During the period of economic recovery and the beginning of construction, it was correct and necessary to implement a high degree of centralization in financial management nationwide, which played an active role. However, with the development of economic construction and the consolidation of the financial and economic foundation, as well as the accumulation of construction experience, it is now necessary and possible to change the financial management system of the past period, so as to clearly define the scope of local financial revenues and expenditures, appropriately expand the authority and responsibility of local governments in financial management, and increase local financial flexibility under the premise of ensuring national key construction. According to the regulations of the State Council, starting from 1958, the national financial management system will undergo important improvements. The main methods of improvement are: (1) Local expenditures, except for basic construction, large-scale relocation and reclamation, and major disaster relief, which are solved by special allocations from the central government, all other normal expenditures for economic construction, social and cultural, and administrative management will be solved by local governments using the revenues allocated by the central government, and local governments will seek a balance between revenues and expenditures. (2) According to the different situations of various places, the revenues of local enterprises and seven local taxes (stamp tax, slaughter tax, vehicle and vessel usage license tax, interest income tax, urban real estate tax, cultural and entertainment tax, and livestock transaction tax) will still be entirely allocated to local governments as fixed revenues. If these revenues are not enough to solve the normal expenditures of local governments, then the revenues of state-owned enterprises (excluding some large enterprises that do not participate in profit-sharing), industrial and commercial taxes (commodity circulation tax, commodity tax, industrial and commercial business tax, industrial and commercial income tax), agricultural taxes, and bond revenues will be shared by the central and local governments according to a certain proportion. (3) After the scope of local revenues and expenditures and the proportion of profit-sharing are determined, they will remain basically unchanged for a certain period. The original plan was to remain unchanged for basically three years, but now it is proposed to remain unchanged for basically five years. Within the allocated scope, local governments will arrange their revenues and expenditures according to the policies and unified plans of the state. The surplus of local budgets at the end of the year will be entirely retained for local use. In addition, new regulations have been made for the financial management system of ethnic autonomous areas. According to the new regulations, the financial management authority of ethnic autonomous areas will be slightly larger than that of general provinces and cities.

What are the benefits of this improvement? The benefit is that after implementing this system, local governments can arrange their expenditures according to their revenues and actual needs, and can make adjustments according to local conditions and specific situations; unlike in the past, some temporary and special expenditures had to be requested from the central government, sometimes resulting in problems not being solved or not being solved in a timely manner. A greater benefit of implementing the new system is that with the development of the economy, local governments can spend more if they have more revenues, and they can continue to use the surplus, which greatly helps to mobilize the enthusiasm of local governments to collect revenues and save expenditures.

The 1958 local budget revenues and expenditures are calculated according to the regulations for improving the financial system. Including the budgets of ethnic autonomous areas, the revenues and expenditures are both 10.41 billion yuan, an increase of 1.416 billion yuan from the 1957 budget execution, a growth of 15.74%, while the growth rate of the 1958 national budget is only 7.27%. In the 1958 local budget expenditures, the economic construction fund is 4.488 billion yuan, an increase of 37.33% from the previous year; the social and cultural fund is 3.494 billion yuan, an increase of 0.61% from the previous year; the administrative management fund is 1.736 billion yuan, a decrease of 15.32% from the previous year; other expenditures are 213 million yuan, an increase of 62.98% from the previous year; in addition, there is a reserve fund of 479 million yuan. The investment in basic construction in the 1958 local budget is 3.9 billion yuan, an increase of 22.3% from the previous year. The growth rate of the 1958 local budget is relatively large. The increased part of the local budget is mainly used to increase economic construction expenditures, while social and cultural expenditures have not increased much, and administrative management expenditures have been significantly reduced, which is in line with the overall policy of the 1958 national budget. The 1958 budgets of various ethnic autonomous areas (including autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties) total 1.366 billion yuan, an increase of 22.92% from the previous year, with a growth rate exceeding the growth rate of the general provincial and municipal local budgets.

(2) Improving the Financial Management System of Enterprises

In the past, in terms of financial management, enterprises, except for the extraction of enterprise incentive funds and the sharing of 40% of over-plan profits, had to hand over all revenues and rely on state allocations for all expenditures. This method limited the enthusiasm of enterprises to a certain extent. To change this situation, the State Council, in the regulations for improving the management system of industry and commerce, appropriately expanded the authority and responsibility of enterprises in financial management, stipulating that a certain proportion of enterprise profits will be retained for enterprise use, and enterprises will arrange their expenditures according to designated purposes. The proportion of enterprise retention is determined as follows: based on the enterprise incentive funds and the amount of over-plan profit sharing, plus the four items of expenses used by enterprises (technical and organizational measures expenses, new product trial production expenses, labor safety protection expenses, and minor asset purchases), the retention proportion is calculated by department. This proportion, once determined, will remain basically unchanged for a certain period. The fixed period is originally planned to be basically unchanged for three years, but now it is proposed to be basically unchanged for five years. In the future, the four items of expenses that enterprises need will not be allocated by the state budget, and enterprises will not separately extract enterprise incentive funds and over-plan profits.

According to the new regulations, the retained income of enterprises and the expenditures arranged by enterprises using the retained income in 1958 are both 1.098 billion yuan, accounting for 10% of the total enterprise profits in 1958. This income and expenditure are arranged and used by enterprises themselves, so they are included as another component in the national budget and are not included in the aforementioned budget income and expenditure figures.

The improvement of the enterprise financial management system, like the improvement of the local financial management system, its benefit is to combine the expenditures of enterprises themselves with the revenues of enterprises themselves, and to combine the unified management of the state over enterprise finances with the independent operation of enterprises. The more enterprises strive to increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs, the more profits they will make, and the more they will retain. This can encourage enterprises to pay more attention to their own revenues and actively improve management to better complete the state plan. Secondly, enterprises having a certain fixed income can timely solve some problems, avoiding the past situation where everything had to be applied for allocations, often wasting time and effort.

The regulations for improving enterprise financial management will be implemented starting in 1958, first in central state-owned enterprises. The implementation of local enterprises, when and how to implement, will be decided by the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government.

(3) Improving the Management of Agricultural Loans

Agricultural loans are a way for the state to support agricultural production through bank credit. In the past, the agricultural loan quotas for various places were centrally controlled and allocated by the People's Bank of China. By the end of 1957, the state had issued a total of nearly 4 billion yuan in agricultural loans (including 200 million yuan for state farms), and in 1958, an additional 4 billion yuan was issued on this basis (including 1 billion yuan for state farms). In addition, credit cooperatives issued about 1 billion yuan in loans in rural areas (mainly the capital of credit cooperatives and deposits attracted). The three combined, the total agricultural loan funds are about 5.4 billion yuan. Calculated based on 120 million rural households nationwide, the average loan per household is 45 yuan, and in some regions with concentrated loans, the average loan per household is over 65 yuan. This is already a huge amount of funds, and in the future, it will not be possible or appropriate to increase it too much. Because increasing loans too much will not only face difficulties in the allocation of national funds, but also increase the debt of agricultural cooperatives, which is not conducive to the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. The current task is to manage the existing funds better, maintain their normal turnover, and use them reasonably. At the same time, in the future, in the management of agricultural loans, it is also necessary to appropriately expand the authority of local governments and increase the responsibility of local governments, so that local governments can, within a certain scope, arrange the various agricultural loans in their regions according to actual needs. In addition, to better mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of local governments, it is necessary to improve the system in the management of agricultural loans, combining the issuance of loans with the recovery of overdue loans and the attraction of savings deposits, so that the more loans local governments recover, the more deposits they attract, the more loans they can issue. This will be very beneficial for improving the efficiency of the use of agricultural loans and accelerating the turnover speed of agricultural loans. Based on the above situation and requirements, in the future, the management of agricultural loans will follow the following principles: (1) The issuance of agricultural loans in various places, except for a small amount of additional allocations by the state according to needs, will all be arranged by local governments within the existing quotas and used on a "quota" basis. (2) Agricultural loans should adhere to the principles of borrowing and returning and returning on time, borrowing and returning, borrowing and returning, to maintain the normal turnover of funds. (3) Great efforts should be made to attract idle funds in rural areas and increase rural deposits. Local governments are allowed to use a certain proportion of the increased rural deposits to increase the issuance of loans. (4) Agricultural loans should mainly be used for production expenses and short-term, quick-return small-scale construction project expenses. Based on the experience of the past few years, it is appropriate to issue long-term loans not exceeding 40% of the total agricultural loans in various places. The term of long-term loans is 2 to 3 years, generally not exceeding 5 years. (5) Loans related to living expenses will still be issued by credit cooperatives, and the loan funds will mainly rely on the deposits attracted by credit cooperatives, with the supplementary part from banks gradually decreasing. (6) Agricultural loans, pre-purchase deposits for agricultural products, loans from credit cooperatives, and other credit investments in rural areas should be arranged and used reasonably by local governments.

(4) Opposing Conservatism, Opposing Waste, and Using a Large-Scale Production and Savings Movement to Ensure the Realization of the 1958 National Budget

Comrades! We have already mentioned the great significance of realizing the 1958 national economic plan, and the smooth realization of the 1958 budget will guarantee the completion and over-fulfillment of the 1958 national economic plan. Therefore, the people of the entire country should strive actively to realize the 1958 budget.

The current situation is very favorable for completing the 1958 budget. On all fronts of the national economy, a great wave of developing socialist construction more, faster, better, and more economically has already been launched. In many industrial and mining enterprises, after the workers' discussions and debates, the old and backward production plans have been overturned, the outdated indicators and quotas have been criticized, and new and advanced production plans have been formulated and are being implemented. The vast number of workers in the rectification have proposed many methods to overcome waste and spend less to achieve more, and have already saved a considerable amount of funds for the state. In rural areas, the nationwide movement of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, as well as the movement to realize the agricultural development outline in advance, is developing at an unprecedented scale and speed. There is no doubt that the large-scale production movement since last winter will greatly promote the increase in agricultural production nationwide in 1958.

Now, the rectification movement is deeply developing towards grassroots units such as factories, mines, enterprises, and agricultural production cooperatives. The rectification movement has already and will continue to promote the transformation of the work style of cadres at all levels, making them more deeply involved with the masses and the actual production. In this regard, the experience of the county party committees of Redan and Macheng in Hubei Province in leading cadres personally engaging in experimental fields has great significance. This truly Marxist leadership method is being promoted in rural work nationwide under the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and is beginning to develop in industrial and mining enterprises. The transformation of the work style of cadres at all levels will undoubtedly promote the great leap in industrial and agricultural production in 1958.

It is precisely because of the estimation of this favorable situation that we believe that the 1958 national budget not only has the possibility of being completed as planned but also, with our active efforts, has the possibility of being over-fulfilled.

To complete and strive to over-fulfill the 1958 national budget, it is necessary to continue to deeply develop the production and savings movement nationwide. All provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, down to all grassroots units, should carry out competitions on production and savings in various departments, conduct periodic evaluations, and summarize at the end of the year to see which units have achieved greater results. In all regions and departments, it is necessary to timely identify advanced units, so that backward units can catch up with advanced units, and advanced units can become even more advanced. Using revolutionary spirit, constantly breaking the old balance, establishing new and advanced balances, then breaking and establishing again, wave after wave, this is the law of the progress of our cause. All factories, mines, enterprises, and basic construction units should strive to fully and over-fulfill their production plans under the policy of more, faster, better, and more economically. All agricultural cooperatives and state farms should continue to actively take various measures to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture. The transportation and commerce departments should also actively serve the great leap in production this year and strive to fully and over-fulfill their revenue plans.

Currently, in many economic and operational units, wasteful practices are still very serious. Many places and departments have too many non-productive constructions, and the standards and costs of projects are still too high, and the consumption of raw materials is still too large. According to the materials revealed by the inspection and exposure of a few enterprise units, the losses caused by waste are shocking. Not long ago, the newspaper introduced the results of the special discussion on anti-waste by the workers of Shanghai Meilin Canned Food Factory: this factory has wasted 4.5 million yuan in raw materials, property, materials, quality accidents, and labor since 1954, which is approximately half of the current working capital. It can be imagined that if every enterprise exposes and overcomes wasteful practices like Meilin Factory, what great benefits it will bring to socialist construction.

Chairman Mao has instructed us: "Be thrifty in running factories, be thrifty in running stores, be thrifty in running all state-owned and cooperative enterprises, be thrifty in running all other enterprises. Everything should be executed on the principle of thrift. This is the principle of saving, and saving is one of the basic principles of the socialist economy. China is a large country, but it is still very poor. To make China rich, it will take several decades. Even after several decades, the principle of thrift should still be executed, but it is especially necessary to advocate thrift and especially pay attention to saving in the current several decades, in the current several five-year plans." This instruction should be implemented in all departments and units.

Currently, the anti-waste struggle is being vigorously carried out in many units nationwide and has already begun to achieve great results. Some units, based on the spirit of opposing conservatism and opposing waste, have re-examined the 1958 plan. The profit remittance of the Beijing Post Office was 16.8 million yuan in 1957. When drafting the 1958 plan, due to conservative thinking and emphasizing difficulties, it was initially planned to be 1.4 million yuan. After repeated discussions, many unnecessary expenditures were canceled, and at the same time, many methods to increase income were found, so its profit remittance plan increased to 3 million yuan. This shows that the potential for saving expenditures and increasing income through anti-waste is very great. Therefore, in all enterprises, departments, and units nationwide, it is necessary to take about ten days during the rectification movement to specially carry out a large-scale discussion, debate, and criticism on the issue of anti-waste, mobilizing the broadest masses to fight against various wasteful practices.

An important link in the anti-waste struggle is the clearance of warehouses. The State Council has decided that all places and departments must carry out a comprehensive clearance of all warehouses under their jurisdiction this year to thoroughly understand the situation, clear out all the materials piled up in the corners and bottoms of warehouses, and put them to use.

We have mentioned before that all national operational expenses should be thoroughly rectified. All institutions that can be streamlined must be streamlined, all institutions that can be merged must be merged, all personnel that can be reduced must be reduced, and all expenditure standards that can be lowered must be lowered, to free up a large amount of funds for production and construction. This is a major task for all places and departments in 1958 and must be carried out seriously.

Another major task in 1958 is to greatly reduce the expenses of state organs, including administrative management expenses and defense expenses. Chairman Mao proposed as early as 1950 that the large-scale reduction of expenses for state organs is one of the three conditions for the fundamental improvement of the financial and economic situation of our country. Chairman Mao's instruction is still applicable to our work today. Starting from last year, the state has decided to streamline administrative organs and transfer a large number of cadres. According to preliminary and incomplete statistics, the number of transferred cadres, including those transferred from enterprise and operational units, has reached 1.1 million by around January 10 this year, and the number of transferred cadres is still increasing. This is a revolutionary measure of great historical significance. This not only gives a large number of cadres the opportunity to be tempered in labor and grassroots work, greatly improves the work efficiency of state organs, greatly reduces bureaucracy, and greatly saves state administrative expenses, reduces the number of people detached from production in a socialist society, and promotes the development of socialist construction.

The realization of all the above tasks of increasing production and savings, opposing waste, depends on the joint efforts of all places and departments nationwide.

Here, we would like to remind all places and departments again that when local governments and enterprises have money, they should concentrate on using it for production and construction, and while actively and quickly developing socialist construction, they should prevent the possible dispersion and waste of funds in the use of funds. State cadres should strictly abide by financial systems and financial discipline. The financial departments should also adapt to the new situation after the change of the system, improve their work style, go deep into the field, strengthen financial supervision, and strive to implement the policy of increasing production and savings.

Comrades! Our country is still a backward country in terms of economy and culture. To build our country into a socialist power, we must be thrifty and diligent to invest more funds in national construction. For this reason, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China not only proposes the policy of building the country thriftily, running enterprises thriftily, running cooperatives thriftily, and running all other enterprises thriftily, but also proposes the policy of thrifty household management. Saving is not only the task of all state cadres and economic workers but also the common task of all the people. Only when the entire country strives to increase accumulation and save funds can our construction cause develop rapidly. Therefore, it is necessary to widely propagate saving among the people, making it known to every household, making saving a social custom, and making everyone voluntarily practice saving. Promoting saving among the people is not contradictory to the reasonable consumption of the people and the legitimate desire to improve their lives on the basis of developing production. We advocate thrifty household management, aiming to make every household save the food and cloth that we are still not rich in, to make cooperative members pay attention to increasing the accumulation of cooperatives, to make everyone pay attention to savings, to oppose idleness and extravagance, to oppose gambling, and to oppose extravagance in weddings, funerals, and festivals. State organ cadres should especially set a good example in thrifty household management. Therefore, the significance of advocating saving and opposing waste is not only to accumulate construction funds but also to change customs and cultivate the good living habits and moral qualities of the people nationwide.

Let us all state cadres, all economic workers, and all the people take action together, rally our revolutionary enthusiasm, oppose conservative thinking, oppose wasteful practices, launch a large-scale production and savings movement, and welcome the high tide of production and construction in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan! Relying on the joint efforts of the people of the entire country, we will definitely be able to overcome any difficulties and over-fulfill the 1958 national budget that serves this high tide!

    关于1957年国家预算执行情况和1958年国家预算草案的报告
    1958年2月1日在第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议上
    国务院副总理兼财政部长　李先念各位代表：
    现在，我代表国务院提出关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告，请予审查。
    （一）1957年国家预算执行情况
    一九五七年国家预算执行情况是良好的。一九五七年国家财政收支计划的超额完成，不但保证了第一个五年计划最后一年的建设计划的完成，而且有力地证明了社会主义制度的强大生命力，粉碎了资产阶级右派分子对于我国财政经济状况的污蔑。在一九五六年底到一九五七年初，由于某些物资的供应情况紧张，加上一九五六年农业上发生了较大的自然灾害，我国财政经济状况曾经遇到某些暂时的局部的困难，右派分子因而幸灾乐祸。但是像在其他所有问题上一样，右派分子在财经问题上押的宝也是完全落空了，而且应该谢谢他们，由于毒草变成了肥料，他们的进攻还大大帮助了劳动人民觉悟的高涨，从而大大促进了增产节约运动的高涨。一九五七年国家预算执行的结果是，财政收入和支出都超过了原计划，并且收入多于支出。应该说，一九五七年的国家财政获得了显著的、令人鼓舞的成绩。
    一九五七年的国家决算还要经过一段时间才能编成，目前只能向大会报告关于国家预算的预计执行情况的数字。根据预计，一九五七年国家财政收入和支出的主要情况如下。
    关于收入：一九五七年原预算收入二百九十三亿九千四百万元，执行结果收入三百零七亿零二百万元，是原预算的百分之一百零四点四五，比一九五六年增长百分之六点八一。根据预计执行数字计算，一九五七年预算收入中，各项税收一百五十四亿三千九百万元，是原预算的百分之一百零五点二四；企业和事业收入一百四十二亿二千一百万元，是原预算的百分之一百零四点零三；债务收入六亿七千三百万元，是原预算的百分之一百零七点九九；其他收入三亿六千九百万元，是原预算的百分之九十二。
    关于支出：一九五七年原预算支出二百九十三亿九千四百万元，执行结果支出三百零五亿四千九百万元，是原预算的百分之一百零三点九三，同一九五六年的支出大体相平。根据预计执行数字计算，一九五七年预算支出中，经济建设费一百四十八亿六千一百万元，是原预算的百分之一百零八点三六；社会文教费四十七亿三千九百万元，是原预算的百分之九十八点零一；国防费五十五亿零九百万元，是原预算的百分之九十九点七四；行政管理费二十三亿二千二百万元，是原预算的百分之九十四点九六；债务和对外援助支出十二亿九千三百万元，是原预算的百分之九十六点七一；其他支出一亿九千九百万元，是原预算的百分之七十二点二七；增拨银行信贷资金和归还一九五六年向银行透支款十五亿五千三百万元（包括用收多于支的款项增拨银行信贷资金的九亿五千三百万元），是原预算的百分之二百五十八点八三；此外，增拨地方预算周转金七千三百万元。一九五七年基本建设投资完成一百一十九亿零五百万元（如果加上各方面用自有资金所进行的基本建设投资计算，是一百二十三亿七千万元），是原计划的百分之一百零七点二五。
    这里应该说明的是，去年由于增产节约运动的发展，财政收入超过了原定计划，而许多方面的支出则比原计划有所节减，根据这种情况，国家在一九五七年下半年，对支出陆续追加了十三亿四千万元。这部分支出主要用在基本建设方面。尽管这样，去年国家财政收入仍然超过支出十一亿零六百万元。这个超过的部分，除了属于地方预算的结余一亿五千三百万元仍然留给地方以外，属于中央预算的结余九亿五千三百万元，已经作为信贷资金增拨给银行，列入一九五七年支出项下了。
    一九五七年国家财政工作的胜利，是在中共中央和国务院所领导的增产节约运动的基础上取得的，是在全国人民进行整风运动和反右派斗争胜利的基础上取得的。广大劳动群众和经济工作人员，热烈地响应了中共中央一九五七年初关于增产节约、勤俭建国的号召。从去年五月开始的思想战线上和政治战线上的轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命运动，把增产节约运动一步又一步地提到了更高的水平。
    在工业方面，广大职工群众通过反右派斗争和整风运动大大地提高了阶级觉悟和革命积极性，从而提高了劳动生产率，加强了劳动纪律，绝大多数企业的职工出勤率比过去有了显著的上升。经过职工群众的积极努力，去年全国工业总产值预计将达到六百二十八亿一千万元，比原计划超过百分之四点一，比一九五六年增长百分之六点九。许多基本建设单位，根据勤俭办企业和勤俭办一切事业的方针，重新审查和修改了设计文件，减少了非生产性的投资，修改了某些过高的和不适当的设计标准，在保证质量的前提下，降低了工程造价。单是中央六个工业部对它们的九十一项工程设计的审查修改，就节约造价四亿多元，其中一部分已经在一九五七年施工过程中节约了，其余的部分将在今后的施工过程中陆续节约。
    在农业方面，全国的农业生产合作社由于执行了勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，改善了经营管理，尽管部分地区发生涝灾和旱灾，农业生产仍然获得了较好的收成，特别是棉花获得了丰收。一九五七年全国农副业总产值达到六百零三亿五千万元，比上年增加二十亿六千万元。通过农村中的大鸣、大放、大辩论，批判了资本主义道路，进行了深入的社会主义教育以后，合作社是进一步巩固了，农民对于重要农产品统购统销政策的认识也大大提高了，这对于一九五七年国家收购农产品计划的顺利实现，起了显著的作用。一九五七年国家发放农业贷款的指标，比一九五六年增加了三亿元，但是由于农民注意节约使用资金和按期归还贷款，一九五七年底，留在农民手中的贷款数字，比一九五六年同期还减少了约二亿七千万元。
    在交通运输、商业和其他各个部门，增产节约运动和整风运动对于一九五七年预算的超额完成，也都起了积极的作用。
    在改进预算管理和节约国家机关经费方面，一九五七年有了显著的进步。各部门严格掌握了人员编制和工资标准，执行了不随意增加人员、不随意提高工资待遇的规定。许多部门对于一些临时发生的支出，大都在自己的预算范围内调剂解决，从而节约了国家的资金。国防费和行政管理费的支出，比原计划节减了一亿三千七百万元以上，比一九五六年的支出减少了九亿四千五百万元之多。
    所有这一切，都说明了增产节约运动和整风运动对于一九五七年国家预算执行结果的重大意义。这两个运动现在正以更大的规模深入发展。毫无疑问，它们对于一九五八年国家预算的执行将产生更大的影响。
    在一九五七年七月本届大会第四次会议上，我们在报告中曾经提出，一九五七年预算执行的结果，不仅要做到收多于支，有一定的结余，而且要做到减少一部分市场货币流通量，增加一部分商品物资库存。现在，这些要求都已经实现了。
    根据人民银行统计，一九五七年底市场货币流通量，在保证商品流转需要的条件下，比一九五六年底减少了四亿五千万元。一九五七年由于工业部门超额完成了生产计划，商业部门在农产品收成较好的条件下扩大了收购量，工商部门向银行借款超过原计划三十四亿六千万元。此外，工商部门还从银行提取了存款五亿元。以上两项合计，工商部门共计多用资金三十九亿六千万元。但是银行的信贷计划执行的结果，仍然做到了信贷收入大于信贷支出。这是因为在增产节约运动的基础上，一九五七年国家预算收多于支，有相当部分的结余拨给银行，城乡人民的储蓄存款也都有相当的增加，农民归还的到期贷款也比较多。银行的信贷收入大于信贷支出，加以一九五七年农村非现金结算部分比过去扩大（农业合作社把现款存入银行，大宗开支通过银行转账，不用提取现款），市场货币流通量就比上年减少了。
    同时，由于增产节约运动的开展和农产品收购的情况良好，由于一九五七年国家预算收多于支，银行信贷收支大大超过计划，国家的商品物资库存也有了相当数量的增加。到一九五七年底，国家主要物资库存，比一九五六年同期增加了五十亿元左右。其中，工业各部门的库存增加十五亿元左右，商业各部门的库存（包括准备供应工业生产的原料在内）增加三十五亿元左右。这样，一九五六年一度减少的国家商品物资库存已经补充起来，而且超过了，市场供应的紧张情况已经缓和，同时，也增加了一部分国家物资储备，这是需要的。现在，库存没有  增加的，只有糖、食油等少数商品，还有待于增加生产，以便  进一步改善供应状况了。
    增产节约运动的发展和国家商品物资库存的增加，保证了市场价格的稳定。一九五七年初，国家为了促进某些农副产品生产的发展，曾主动地提高了它们的收购价格和销售价格；同时，为了调节供求关系，还调高了某些高级消费品的销售价格。但是由于财政、银行信贷、物资供应等方面都顺利地实现了预定要求，一九五七年的物价基本上仍然是稳定的。许多重要的人民生活必需品没有涨价。涨了价的商品，在社会商品零售总额中只占很小的比重。从去年六月以后，物价一直保持了稳定。农副产品的价格调整，使得农民和手工业劳动者得到了利益，从而显著地促进了这些产品的生产。例如一九五六年全国只有猪九千七百八十万头，一九五七年就达到一亿二千七百七十七万头，比一九五六年增长百分之三十以上。
    一九五七年国家预算执行的情况证明，在一切财政经济工作中，必须充分地认识到人的因素、政治的因素的伟大作用，必须充分地认识到劳动人民在新的社会主义生产关系下的革命积极性的伟大作用。充分地认识到这些作用，就会使我们在任何困难面前都能保持充分的信心、坚定性和革命的干劲。
    政治是为经济基础服务的，它是经济工作的保证，同时又是经济工作和其他一切工作的统帅和灵魂。正如毛主席所说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生变革的时期，尤其是这样。”
    当一九五六年冬财政经济情况遇到某些暂时的局部的困难的时候，我们曾经一度对于财经工作中的某些个别问题（例如基本建设上多用了一些钱）作了一些不适当的估计。但是党中央和毛主席随即给我们指出了正确的方向，告诉我们必须分清事物的主流和支流、本质和现象，指示我们只要坚决发动群众开展增产节约运动，当时的一些困难，在几个月以后就一定可以有显著的好转。一九五七年财政经济情况的发展，完全证明了这个预见的正确。这对于所有政府工作人员特别是财经工作人员，都是一个值得注意的教训。
    一九五七年是我国第一个五年计划的最后一年。当我们回顾一九五七年的国家预算执行情况的时候，应该简单地回顾一下整个五年的国家财政。
    第一个五年计划期间，财政收入共计一千三百六十五亿六千二百万元（不包括企业单位的大修理基金和企业奖励基金），财政支出共计一千三百六十四亿零九百万元，收入大于支出一亿五千三百万元。同原订的五年财政计划比较，五年财政收入相当于原计划一千三百零九亿四千一百万元的百分之一百零四点二，五年财政支出相当于原计划一千二百八十二亿零六百万元的百分之一百零六点四。
    在五年财政支出中，基本建设投资共计四百八十七亿七千七百万元，相当于原订基本建设投资计划四百二十七亿四千万元的百分之一百一十四点一二。
    财政收入和支出的构成情况，在五年内已经随着整个国家经济情况的变化而发生了显著的变化。一九五二年国家收入来自国营、公私合营和合作社营等社会主义经济部门的，占总收入百分之六十点一，一九五七年则增至百分之九十五。而从其他方面所取得的部分，在总收入中已经只占极小的比重。在支出方面，国家建设支出（包括经济建设和文化教育建设）在总支出中所占的比重，由一九五二年百分之五十九增至一九五七年的百分之六十四点一七，而国家机关支出（包括国防费和行政管理费）所占的比重，则由一九五二年的百分之三十六点三降至一九五七年的百分之二十五点六三。
    很明显，在第一个五年计划期间，我国的财政力量是壮大了，而且巩固了。第一个五年的财政计划基本上是适当的，它的实现不但保证了第一个五年计划的完成，而且为第二个五年计划时期的财政准备了良好的基础。
    （二）1958年国家预算的安排
    一九五八年是我国第二个五年建设计划的第一年，也将是伟大的全民整风运动在各方面表现出惊人的革命力量的一年。全国人民，为了尽可能迅速地把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国，正在积极努力，贯彻执行又多又快又好又省地发展社会主义建设的方针，争取在今后十五年或者更多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），并且争取在不太长的时间内，在急需的科学技术部门接近或者达到世界先进水平。
    目前的国际形势，对于我国人民的这个有历史意义的努力是十分有利的。一九五七年是世界政治的一个新的转折点，东风显著地压倒了西风，这个真理现在越看越清楚了。以苏联为首的社会主义国家的力量日趋壮大，国际无产阶级的力量日趋壮大，主张维护和平的国际力量日趋壮大，而以美国为首的帝国主义集团则日益陷于混乱和被动。很明显，我们建成社会主义越早，我们对于世界和平也就贡献得越多。
    大家知道，在第二个五年计划期间，我国的工业和农业都将有重大的发展。目前，广大的工人、农民和全体劳动人民在“五年看三年，三年看头年”和“苦战三年”的口号的鼓舞下，正在用空前高涨的劳动热情，来迎接一九五八年的国民经济计划。他们要求一九五八年在各个战线上向前迈进一大步，以便为第二个五年计划奠定优越的基础。在全国各地，先进的指标正在不断地被实现和突破，先进的经验正在不断地被创造和推广。全民族精神振奋，生气蓬勃，大家都卷入了落后赶先进、先进再前进的竞赛浪潮中，希望在尽可能短的时间内使我国大部分地区的面貌能有基本上的改观。在这种情况下，一九五八年的国民经济完全有可能实现一个新的跃进。
    适应这种形势，一九五八年的国家预算，是一个反对保守倾向、积极挖掘潜力、收入和支出增长得比较快的预算，是一个贯彻整风精神、坚决反对浪费和坚决紧缩非生产性支出的预算，是一个积极增加生产性支出、积极发展基本建设和大力支援农业的预算。为了便于调动群众的积极性，从一九五八年起还改进了财政管理制度，扩大了地方管理财政和企业管理财务的职权。这个问题将在后面说明。
    一九五八年国家预算收入三百三十亿六千三百万元，预算支出三百三十亿六千三百万元，收支平衡。一九五八年预算同一九五七年预计执行数比较，按照一九五八年的预算编列方法计算，收入增加二十二亿四千二百万元，增长百分之七点二七；支出增加二十三亿九千五百万元，增长百分之七点八一。
    一九五八年预算收入的增长是不是充分可靠的呢？我们认为是的。前面已经说过全国工人、农民和全体劳动人民，通过整风运动，增产节约的积极性空前高涨了。除了这一个最基本的有利条件以外，还必须看到以下几点：第一个五年计划期间完成的建设项目，大部分将要在一九五八年达到设计的生产能力。此外一九五八年还将有一批新建的企业投入生产。一九五七年的农产品特别是棉花和甘蔗收成比较好，有利于一九五八年轻工业的发展和工商业收入的增加。由于一九五七年冬季以来全国各地空前大规模的农业增产运动，一九五八年农业产量将有显著的增加，各种大中小型的农田水利工程也显然将使农业生产抵抗灾荒的力量加强。由于这一切，我们认为，一九五八年的预算收入的计划不但可以完成，而且可以争取超额完成。
    一九五八年国家预算各类收入如下：
    一、各项税收一百六十四亿九千七百万元，占预算收入百分之四十九点九，是一九五七年预计执行数的百分之一百零六点八五。其中：工商税一百二十三亿九千万元，是上年的百分之一百零九点六；农业税二十九亿九千七百万元，是上年的百分之一百零二点二五。
    二、企业和事业收入一百五十七亿一千六百万元，占预算收入百分之四十七点五三，是上年的百分之一百零八点九五。其中：工业各部门收入七十五亿一千万元，是上年的百分之一百一十五点一一；铁道、交通、邮电等部门收入二十三亿八千八百万元，是上年的百分之一百零四点八七；商业、对外贸易等部门收入四十六亿三千五百万元，是上年的百分之一百零六点八六。
    三、债务收入六亿三千万元，全部是国内公债收入，占预算收入百分之一点九一，是上年的百分之九十三点五九。
    四、其他收入二亿二千万元，占预算收入百分之零点六六，是上年的百分之七十七点五四。
    在这里应该说明，一九五八年的农业税收入略有增加。预算中所列的农业税收入是二十九亿九千七百万元，比一九五七年增加六千六百万元，折合细粮七亿七千万斤。农业税的预算年度是从每年的秋季开始的，和征税年度从年初开始不同。如果按征税年度来看，一九五七年夏征加秋征细粮三百四十八亿斤，一九五八年预计夏征加秋征细粮三百六十二亿斤，一九五八年比一九五七年的增加数字就不是七亿七千万斤而是十四亿斤。由于农业税正税的增加，也由于获利较大的经济作物地区农业税附加幅度有所增长，估计农业税附加要增加四亿斤。以上正税和附加合计共增加十八亿斤，比上年的征收额增长百分之四点五七。
    从一九五二年以来，我国农业税负担已经基本上稳定了五年，在这个期间农业生产有了相当的发展。一九五八年在生产继续发展的基础上，适当增加一些税收，农民是会赞成的。所有爱国的农民都了解，国家的社会主义建设事业进行得愈多愈快，农民得到的利益也就愈大愈早；只要国家建设需要，农民在生产发展收入增加的情况下，是愿意多贡献一份力量的。但是为了进一步鼓舞农民的增产积极性，农业税收也不宜于多变。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告中曾经宣布，几年以内，国家将把征粮和购粮的数量大体稳定在八百几十亿斤的水平上。这就是说，除购粮五百多亿斤以外，征粮在几年内将不超出三百几十亿斤。我们打算，今年把征收数字稍加提高以后，仍然像前几年一样，稳定五年不变。事实上，一九五八年征收数字虽然有一点增加，由于农业产量预计将比上年提高百分之七（如果包括农副业产值，预计比上年提高百分之六点一），农业税占农业产量的比重却将由上年的百分之十一点三降至百分之十一点零六；如果产量提高更多，这个比重也就要下降更多。在今后五年农业税稳定不变的情况下，这个比重仍将继续下降。
    关于农业税征收办法，在上次会议上所作的一九五七年预算报告中曾经说到，要根据农业合作化实现以后的新情况，作必要的修改。过去农业税是按户计征的，今后要改为以农业合作社为单位计征。过去有些地区实行比例税制，有些地区实行累进税制，今后要改为全国一律都实行比例税制。并且，农业税的计税产量和征收税率，也要根据新的情况，加以调整和修订。现在经过多次研究，新的农业税条例草案已经拟出，即将提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准试行。试行一年以后，加以修改，再提请全国人民代表大会批准，正式公布施行。
    在这里还需要说明，一九五八年准备实行工商税制的某些改革。改革的主要内容是改变现行的多种税多次征收的办法，把现有的商品流通税、货物税、营业税、印花税等四种税收加以合并，简化纳税手续。改革法案将提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准。随着财政体制的改进，在一九五八年还需要改进税务管理体制，把若干可以由地方负责处理的税收管理权限，交给地方掌握，由地方根据当地经济发展和实际情况的需要，因地制宜地加以处理，使国家税制在发展生产和巩固社会主义经济方面，能够更好地发挥作用。估计这些办法实行以后，在税收指标和企业收入指标之间将引起若干变化，在中央财政收入和地方财政收入之间也将引起若干变化，需要在预算执行过程中加以相应的调整。
    一九五八年国家预算各类支出如下：
    一、经济建设费一百七十五亿四千八百万元，占预算支出百分之五十三点零七，是上年预计执行数的百分之一百一十七点二八。其中，工业支出九十一亿六千九百万元，是上年的百分之一百一十三点零七；农业、林业、水利等支出二十九亿四千万元，是上年的百分之一百四十点七八；铁道、交通、邮电等支出二十五亿四千万元，是上年的百分之一百一十四点四七；商业、粮食、对外贸易等支出二亿七千九百万元，是上年的百分之七十六点三三。
    二、社会文教费四十八亿九千六百万元，占预算支出百分之十四点八一，是上年的百分之一百零二点八五。其中，文化支出二亿零八百万元，是上年的百分之一百一十二点一九；初等和中等教育支出二十二亿五千三百万元，是上年的百分之一百零二点二一；高等教育支出五亿九千九百万元，是上年的百分之九十六点六七；科学支出三亿八千四百万元，是上年的百分之一百三十一点三；卫生支出五亿四千九百万元，是上年的百分之一百零八点九九；抚恤和救济支出五亿四千万元，是上年的百分之九十一点三六。
    三、国防费五十亿元，占预算支出百分之十五点一二，是上年的百分之九十点七六。
    四、行政管理费二十亿元，占预算支出百分之六点零五，是上年的百分之八十六点一三。
    五、债务支出十亿三千一百万元，占预算支出百分之三点一二，是上年的百分之一百二十三点零一。
    六、对外援助支出四亿一千四百万元，占预算支出百分之一点二五，是上年的百分之九十一点一六。
    七、其他支出二亿八千三百万元，占预算支出百分之零点八六，是上年的百分之一百四十四点六九。
    八、增拨银行信贷资金八亿元，占预算支出百分之二点四二。
    九、总预备费十亿九千一百万元，占预算支出百分之三点三。
    关于一九五八年国家预算支出的安排，需要说明以下几点：
    （一）一九五八年国家预算支出中，经济建设费和社会文教费所占的比重，将由一九五七年的百分之六十四点一七，上升到百分之六十七点八八，国防费和行政管理费所占的比重，将由一九五七年的百分之二十五点六三，降低到百分之二十一点一七。从两年的绝对数字来比较，一九五八年经济建设费增加二十五亿八千六百万元；社会文教费增加一亿三千五百万元；国防费减少五亿零九百万元；行政管理费减少三亿二千二百万元。一九五八年预算安排上的这种变化，说明国家预算支出正在不断地节减非生产性的支出而增加生产性的支出。这对于多快好省地发展社会主义建设是完全必要的。
    大力节减国防和行政管理开支是我国一九五八年国家预算的一个特点。同美国和其他帝国主义国家的扩军备战的预算根本相反，我国的国防费用和行政费用不但在国家预算中所占的比重进一步降低了，而且绝对数字也有了很大的减少。这个事实表明什么呢？它充分地表明了我国人民从事和平劳动的热烈愿望，表明了我国政府紧缩国家机关经费以加速发展社会主义建设的决心。
    国家机构费用的节减，决不意味着它们的工作的削弱，相反地，这将有利于它们的工作的加强。这一节减不但在经济上具有重大的意义，而且在政治上具有更重大的意义。党中央和毛主席号召我们国家工作人员打掉官气，同劳动人民打成一片，以普通劳动者一分子的面目在他们面前出现。铺张浪费是官气的一个重要标志，我们要打掉官气，就必须彻底地打掉铺张浪费。我们的政府是人民的政府，我们的军队是人民的军队，我们应该完全有志气和决心花最少的钱，作最多的事，使我们的政府和军队成为最理想的为人民服务的政府和军队。
    （二）一九五八年国家预算的各类支出中，用于基本建设方面的投资共一百三十八亿三千六百万元。这些投资，绝大部分用于发展经济建设；在社会文教和行政管理方面的基本建设，比一九五七年还有所减少。
    一九五八年用于基本建设方面的投资，除了上述一百三十八亿三千六百万元外，还有国营企业和供销合作社用自有资金安排的基本建设投资和其他方面的基本建设投资约计七亿四千一百万元。如果把这些投资加在一起计算，则一九五八年国家用于基本建设方面的投资总额共达一百四十五亿七千七百万元，比一九五七年增加二十二亿零七百万元，增长百分之十七点八。一九五八年基本建设投资所以增加较多，一方面是由于财政收入增加了，另一方面是由于紧缩了军政费用和其他的开支。
    一九五八年将有一千一百八十五个限额以上的建设项目开始施工或者继续施工。此外，国家还准备了若干基本建设的预备项目。在预算执行的过程中，只要收入超过计划，支出有所节减，原材料工业又增产节约，就可以及时地追加基本建设投资，争取一部分预备项目能够在今年施工。
    在一九五八年基本建设投资的分配上，缩减了社会文教和行政管理方面的基本建设投资，增大了经济建设方面的基本建设投资。在经济建设方面的投资中，首先保证了重点建设的需要，同时着重地增加了农业、水利、化学肥料工业、农业机械工业的投资，适当地增加了燃料工业、电力工业、原材料工业、急需的机械工业和其他薄弱环节的投资。
    为了在计划和预算执行中，进一步节约使用资金，以便腾出钱来多安排一些建设项目，国家还要求一九五八年在计划确定的基础上，进一步在保证工程质量的条件下，降低工程造价。具体的要求是：按照已经确定的基本建设投资总额节减百分之七到百分之十。节减下来的资金，仍归各部门各地方安排另外的建设开支。
    （三）一九五八年国家对于农业生产的财政支援，比往年有较多的增加。国家预算中用于农业方面的支出共二十九亿四千万元，比一九五七年增加八亿五千二百万元，增长百分之四十点七八。其中：有关农林水利的基本建设支出二十亿六千九百万元；有关农林水利的事业费和增拨的流动资金八亿七千一百万元。除了以上直接用于农业方面的支出以外，一九五八年国家预算还增加了较多的化学肥料工业、农业机械工业等同农业生产有关的支出。此外，国家还通过发放贷款和预购农产品等信用方式，对农业进行支援。一九五八年国家发放农业贷款的指标将达四十四亿元，比一九五七年增加四亿元。一九五八年国营商业和供销合作社发放的农产品预购定金将有十一亿元，比一九五七年实际发放数增加五亿元。以上通过信用方式支援农业生产的资金比一九五七年增加九亿元。
    必须指出：农业在生产和建设上所需要的资金，同工业不同，主要地是依靠农业生产合作社本身的积累。国家对于农业的财政支援是必要的，否则就不可能解决大型水利工程、化学肥料工业、农业机械工业的建设和其他需要集中投入大量资金的问题。但是这决不是说，可以把农民自己的积累放在第二位。根据初步估计，如果全国的农业合作社都把扣除生产费用以后的农副业收入的百分之八作为公积金，一九五八年全国农业合作社可以提取的公积金总额就可能达到三十亿元左右。为了满足进一步扩大再生产的需要，国家最近已经决定，农业合作社公积金比例还可以适当提高，那么，今后全国农业合作社公积金的总额还可能更大。而且，在农业生产和建设当中起决定作用的，首先还是广大农民自己的劳动力。我国农民有五亿以上，这是一个伟大无比的劳动力资源。农业方面的基本建设绝大部分是中小型工程，有了劳动力就有了主要的保证，而我国的农民的劳动力是比较充裕的，过去在农闲季节，农民的劳动力还有剩余。现在要把农闲变为农忙，在农业方面广泛地、大规模地进行基本建设，主要的希望就在这里。许多事实证明，在社会主义社会中，只要认真依靠和发挥农民的革命积极性，组织农民进行有计划地征服自然的劳动，并且给予必要的技术指导，国家不要花很多的钱，就可以使农业大大增产。一九五七年冬季，由于中共中央发布了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），由于中共中央和国务院联合发布了兴修农田水利和积肥运动的决定，全国农民的生产热情受到了极大的鼓舞。在最近时期，亿万农民群众，夜以继日，不顾天寒地冻，用移山倒海的英雄气概，掀起了热火朝天的兴修农田水利运动。从去年10月到今年1月中旬，每天在水利工程战线上从事劳动的农民，全国约有一亿人，按一亿人劳动一百天计算，农民投到水利建设上的劳动，已经有一百亿个劳动日。如果每个劳动日的工资平均按六角钱计算，农民就已经投资六十亿元。当然，一百亿个劳动日所创造的财富要远远超过此数，这些水利工程发挥的效益，将是不可估量的。现在这个运动还在继续发展，事实已经很清楚，今年的水利建设将大大超过计划，而在这样大规模的建设运动中，农民群众并不需要国家拿多少钱。这不是充分地说明了群众的积极性一经组织和发挥起来，就可以自己解决很多很大的问题么？因此，有了广大农民的劳动力的投资和公积金的积累，再加上国家的积极支援，只要使用得当，迅速发展农业生产所需要的资金是完全可以解决的。
    （四）一九五八年国家预算的各类支出中，用于事业费方面的支出共有五十八亿一千九百万元，比一九五七年增加二亿六千七百万元，增长百分之四点八一。事业费是国家预算中除了基本建设、流动资金和军政费用以外的主要支出。一九五八年的事业费，分类来看有这样几笔：（1）工业交通方面的事业费，包括勘察设计、航道维护、公路养护等费用共六亿三千五百万元；（2）农林水利方面的事业费，包括技术推广、畜牧兽医、森林防护、水土保持、民办农田水利补助等费用共八亿三千八百万元；（3）国家测绘、城市公用事业等事业一亿六千二百万元（以上三种在国家预算中属于经济建设费类）；（4）文化教育方面的事业费，包括大、中、小学教育、中等技术教育、科学研究、出版、广播等，共三十一亿九千八百万元；（5）卫生方面的事业费，包括妇幼保健、疫病防治、公费医疗等费用共四亿四千九百万元；（6）抚恤救济方面的事业费共五亿三千七百万元（以上三种在国家预算中属于社会文教费类）。
    上述各项事业费的数字已经经过了初步的压缩。我们认为在预算执行的过程中，通过群众的辩论和实践，在若干方面还可以进一步节约。为什么呢？这是因为目前事业费开支中，存在着很多浪费现象，节约的潜力很大。各种各样依靠事业费维持和发展的学校、医院、工作台、站、队、组、班、所等事业单位，遍布城乡各地，点多面广，有不少的事业，系统繁复，机构重叠，财务管理很不健全，如果大力实行精简节约，一定可以省下一笔不小的资金。事业的性质各有不同。有些事业是需要国家多投资金积极发展的，就是这类事业也必须对于资金的使用大力节约。至于普通教育、卫生医疗、小型农田水利、乡村道路桥梁等事业，本身就具有公益事业的性质，应该分别情况，提倡民办自给或者民办公助，而不应该全部由国家出钱举办。有些事情由群众自己去办，还可能办得更好，更适合群众需要。无论由谁来办这些事业，都不能脱离当前我国生产发展的水平和人民生活的水平。凡是能够因陋就简的，就应该因陋就简，力求少花钱，多办事。事业费用的节减，主要是依靠紧缩机构、减少人员和降低费用开支标准，人员的工资一般并不减低。财政部和其他有关部门对于事业费的管理，过去都注意得不够，今后在预算执行过程中，必须继续努力进行节减。
    （五）一九五八年国家预算的各类支出中，用于增拨企业流动资金的支出共有七亿元，同时银行信贷计划中也列有增加企业的贷款二十亿六千万元，两项合计，一九五八年企业流动资金共增加二十七亿六千万元。其中，工业流动资金增加十一亿六千万元，商业流动资金增加十四亿六千七百万元，农业和交通运输企业等增加流动资金一亿三千三百万元。我国工业生产和商品流转每年都在扩大，一九五八年将扩大得更多一些，为了保证企业不间断生产和正常周转，增拨这样一笔流动资金是必要的。但是应该承认，目前在流动资金的管理和运用上，仍然存在着严重的缺点，主要是定额高、占用多、周转慢。为了节约使用资金，我们正在研究加强流动资金管理的有效办法，并且决定从一九五八年起，先采取以下一些措施：（1）中央工业的定额流动资金，过去全部由国家预算拨付，无偿使用；一九五八年起，改为大部分由预算拨款，小部分由银行贷款。（2）工业向银行贷款的利率，过去为月息四点八厘；一九五八年起改为和商业一样，月息六厘。（3）地方企业的定额流动资金，过去基本上是由财政拨款解决的；根据改进财政管理体制的规定，一九五八年起，改为由地方财政解决一部分，由银行贷款解决一部分。此外，对于商业企业，也正在研究规定库存定额，提出加强流动资金管理的办法。所有以上这些措施的目的，都是为了促使企业加强经济核算，节约使用流动资金，并且加强地方对银行信贷计划的关心，以便从预算和信贷两个方面加强流动资金的管理和监督。流动资金是国家资金分配的一个重要方面。节约流动资金，不仅意味着减少企业的不必要储备，缩短企业的生产周期，提高企业的经营管理水平；而且可以腾出很多钱来，用于增加基本建设，加快国民经济的发展。我国的流动资金每年增加几十亿元，但是流动资金的管理还是财务工作中的一个很薄弱的环节，财政、银行和企业主管部门必须积极努力，改进这方面的状况。
  （三）1958年财政制度的改进
    根据第一个五年计划期间的经验，政府已经决定对于财政管理制度作若干重大的改进，并且已经经过全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十四次会议批准，从一九五八年起实行。这些改进是为了在财政方面调整中央同地方、国家同企业之间的关系；是为了更好地把统一领导的原则同因地制宜的原则结合起来，更好地把全体的利益同局部的利益结合起来，以更充分调动一切积极因素，更有效地为建设社会主义服务。此外，对于农业贷款的管理，今年也将有所改进。现在一并说明如下。
    （一）关于改进财政管理体制
    过去几年中，地方财政的管理办法，实质上可以说是收入向上缴，支出由上面拨款，地方对于本地区的收支，难于因地制宜，统筹安排；地方一些特殊的支出需要，有时得不到解决或者不能及时解决。并且在预算确定以后，增加的收入和节约的支出，往往不能由地方另外使用，因此，地方积极性的发挥，受到一定程度的限制。过去几年虽然也对财政制度作过若干改进，比如扩大地方在各项支出之间调剂使用的权限，允许地方使用一部分上年结余等等，但是上述状况没有得到根本的改变。
    在经济恢复和开始建设时期，财政管理上在全国实行较大程度的集中是正确的，必要的，起了积极作用的。但是随着经济建设的发展，随着财政经济基础的巩固和建设经验的积累，现在已经有必要和可能改变过去一个时期的财政管理体制，以便明确划定地方财政的收支范围，适当扩大地方在财政管理上的权限和责任，并且在保证国家重点建设的前提下，增加地方的机动财力了。根据国务院的规定，从一九五八年起，国家财政管理体制将要作重要的改进。改进的办法主要是：（1）地方支出除了基本建设、大规模移民垦荒和重大灾荒救济等特殊性支出，由中央专案拨款解决以外，其余经济建设、社会文教和行政管理等正常性的支出，一概由地方用中央划定的收入去解决，自求收支平衡。（2）根据各地方的不同情况，把地方企业收入和七种地方税收（印花税、屠宰税、车船使用牌照税、利息所得税、城市房地产税、文化娱乐税、牲畜交易税），仍然全部划给地方，作为地方固定收入；如果用这些收入不足以解决地方正常支出的，就把中央国营企业收入（若干不参加分成的大型企业除外）、工商税收（商品流通税、货物税、工商营业税、工商所得税）、农业税和公债收入，按照一定的比例，由中央和地方实行分成。（3）地方收支范围、收入项目和分成比例确定以后，在一定时期内基本上固定不变。固定的期限，原来定为基本上三年不变，现在拟改为基本上五年不变。地方在划定的范围以内，根据国家的方针政策和统一的计划，
  自行安排收支。地方预算的年终结余，全部留归地方使用。此外，关于民族自治地方的财政体制也作了新的规定。按照新的规定，民族自治地方的财政管理权限，比一般省市要大一些。
    这种改进有什么好处呢？好处就是，实行这种制度以后，地方可以根据收入安排支出，按照实际需要，因地因事制宜；免得像过去那样，一些临时发生的和特殊的支出，须要向中央要求拨款，以致有时问题得不到解决或者得不到及时的解决。而实行新制度的一个更大的好处是，随着经济的发展，地方收入多了可以多支，结余了可以继续使用，这就大大有利于发挥地方组织收入和节约支出的积极性。
    一九五八年地方预算收支数字就是按照改进财政体制的规定核算的。包括民族自治地方的预算在内，收支各为一百零四亿一千万元，同一九五七年预算执行数比较，增加十四亿一千六百万元，增长百分之十五点七四，而一九五八年国家预算的增长比例只有百分之七点二七。地方预算支出中，经济建设费四十四亿八千八百万元，比上年增长百分之三十七点三三；社会文教费三十四亿九千四百万元，比上年增长百分之零点六一；行政管理费十七亿三千六百万元，比上年减少百分之十五点三二；其他支出二亿一千三百万元，比上年增加百分之六十二点九八；此外，还有预备费四亿七千九百万元。一九五八年地方预算各类支出中用于基本建设方面的投资共为三十亿九千万元，比上年增长百分之二十二点三。一九五八年地方预算增长的幅度是较大的。地方预算增长的部分，主要地是用来增加了经济建设支出，社会文教支出则增加不多，行政管理费还有很大的减少，这是符合一九五八年国家预算的总的方针的。一九五八年各民族自治地方的预算（包括民族自治区、自治州、自治县）共为十三亿六千六百万元，比上年增长百分之二十二点九二，增长的比例超过一般省市地方预算增长的比例。
    （二）关于改进企业财务管理制度
    过去企业在财务管理方面，除了按照规定提取企业奖励基金，并且在超计划利润中分得百分之四十以外，收入要全部上缴，支出要全部由国家拨款。这样的办法使企业的积极性在一定的程度上受了限制。为了改变这种情况，国务院在关于改进工业和商业管理体制的规定中，适当地扩大企业在财务管理上的权限和责任，规定从企业利润中分出一定比例的数目，留给企业使用，由企业根据指定的用途自行安排支出。企业留成的比例是这样规定的：根据企业提取的奖励基金和超计划利润分成数，加上企业领用的四项费用（技术组织措施费、新种类产品试制费、劳动安全保护费、零星资产购置费），以部为单位，分别算出一定的留成比例。这个比例确定之后，在一定时期内基本上固定不变。固定的期限，也是原来定为基本上三年不变，现在拟改为基本上五年不变。今后企业所需要的四项费用，国家预算即不再拨款，企业也不再另外提取企业奖励基金和超计划利润了。
    根据新规定核算的结果，一九五八年企业留成收入和企业用留成收入安排的支出各为十亿九千八百万元，相当于一九五八年企业利润总数的百分之十。这笔收支是由企业自行安排使用的，所以作为另外一个组成部分纳入国家预算，没有包括在前述预算收支数字以内。
    改进企业财务管理制度同改进地方财政管理体制一样，它的好处首先是可以把企业本身的支出同企业本身的收入结合起来，把国家对企业财务的统一管理同企业的独立经营结合起来。企业越是努力增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，获得的利润越多，那么他们留成的部分也就越多。这就可以促使企业更加关心自己的收入，从而积极改善经营管理，更好地完成国家计划。其次，企业本身有了一部分固定的收入，可以及时处理一些问题，免得像过去那样，事无大小都要申请拨款，往往费时误事。
    改进企业财务管理的规定，从一九五八年开始，首先在中央国营企业中实行。地方企业怎样实行，何时实行，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会自行决定。
    （三）关于改进农业贷款的管理
    农业贷款是国家通过银行信贷支持农业生产的一种方式。过去各地农业贷款的指标，是由中国人民银行总行集中掌握统一分配的。截至一九五七年底，国家先后拨出的农业贷款指标已近四十亿元（其中用于国营农场的二亿元），一九五八年在这个基础上又增加新的拨款四亿元（其中用于国营农场的一亿元）。此外，信用合作社在农村中发放的贷款还有约十亿元（主要是信用社的股金和吸收的存款）。三项合计，农业贷款资金共有五十四亿元左右。按全国一亿二千万农户计算，平均每户贷款四十五元，个别贷款集中地区每户平均在六十五元以上。这已经是一笔巨大的资金，今后不可能也不应该增加过多。因为过多地发放贷款，不仅在国家的资金分配方面有困难，而且增加农业合作社的债务，对于农业合作社的巩固也是不利的。现在的任务是把现有的资金管理得更好，使它保持正常的周转，并且合理地使用。同时今后在农贷管理方面，也需要随着财政体制的改变，适当地扩大地方的权限，加大地方的责任，使地方能够在一定的范围内，根据实际需要，统筹安排本地区的各种农业贷款。此外，为了更有利于发挥地方的积极性和主动性，在农业贷款管理方面，还有必要通过制度的改进，把发放贷款同收回到期贷款、吸收储蓄存款结合起来，使地方收回贷款越多，吸收存款越多，可以发放的贷款也就越多。这样，对于提高农业贷款的使用效率和加快农业贷款的周转的速度，都有很大的好处。根据上述情况和要求，今后在农业贷款的管理上将实行以下原则：（1）各地农业贷款的发放，除了国家根据需要增加的少量拨款以外，一律在现有指标的范围内，由地方统筹安排，“包干”使用。（2）农业贷款应该坚持有借有还和按期归还的原则，收了再贷，贷了再收，以保持资金的正常周转。（3）大力吸收农村闲散资金，增加农村存款。允许地方在增加的农村存款中，按照规定的比例，提取一部分用来增发贷款。（4）农业贷款应该主要用于生产费用和期限较短、收效较快的小型建设工程费用上。根据几年来的经验，发放长期贷款以不超过各地农贷总额的百分之四十左右为宜。长期贷款的期限是二至三年，一般不要超过五年。（5）有关生活方面的贷款仍然由信用合作社发放，贷款资金主要靠信用合作社吸收存款，银行补助的部分应该逐年减少。（6）农业贷款、农产品预购定金、信用合作社放款以及农村中的其他信用投放，应该由地方统一安排，合理使用。
    （四）反保守，反浪费，用大规模的增产节约运动来保证实现1958年的国家预算
    各位代表！我们在前面已经说到实现一九五八年国民经济计划的重大意义，而一九五八年预算的顺利实现，将保证一九五八年国民经济计划的完成和超额完成。因此，全国人民应该积极努力，为一九五八年预算的实现而奋斗。
    目前的形势对于完成一九五八年的预算是十分有利的。在国民经济的各个战线上，现在都已掀起巨大的又多又快又好又省地发展社会主义建设事业的高潮。在许多工矿企业单位，经过工人群众的讨论和辩论，旧的落后的生产计划被推翻了，陈旧的指标和定额受到了批判，新的先进的生产计划被制定出来，并且开始被付之实施。广大的职工群众在整改中提出了很多克服浪费和少花钱、多办事的办法，并且已经替国家节约了相当数量的资金。在农村方面，全国农民兴修水利和积肥的运动，以及提前实现农业发展纲要的运动，正在以史无前例的规模和速度发展着。毫无疑问，从去年冬季以来的大生产运动将大大促进一九五八年全国农业生产的增长。
    现在整风运动正深入地向厂矿企业和农业生产合作社等基层单位发展。整风运动已经而且将要继续促使各级领导工作人员改变作风，深入群众，深入生产的实际。在这个方面，湖北红安、麻城等县中共县委所创造的领导干部亲自动手搞试验田的经验，具有重大的原则意义。这种真正马克思主义的领导方法，正在中共中央和毛主席的号召下，在全国农村工作中推广，并且开始向工矿企业中发展。各级领导人员工作作风的这种转变，必然能够促进一九五八年工农业生产的巨大高涨。
    正是因为估计到这种有利的形势，所以我们认为，一九五八年的国家预算不仅有可能按计划完成，而且只要我们积极努力，还有可能超额完成。
    为了完成和争取超额完成一九五八年的国家预算，必须在全国范围继续深入地展开增产节约运动。全国各省、自治区、直辖市、直到各基层单位，都应该就各部门的增产节约展开竞赛，定期评比，年终总结，看看哪些单位成绩更大。在各个地区和各个部门中，都应该及时找出先进单位，使落后的赶上先进的，使先进的更加先进。用革命的精神，不断地破坏旧的平衡，建立新的、先进的平衡，然后又破坏，又建立，一浪赶一浪，这正是我们的事业前进的规律。所有的厂矿企业和基本建设单位，都应该在多、快、好、省的方针下，努力全面地完成和超额完成自己的生产计划。所有的农业合作社和国营农场，都应该继续积极采取各种措施，争取农业的大丰收。交通运输部门和商业部门，也都应该积极地为争取今年的生产大跃进服务，并且努力完成和超额完成自己的收入计划。
    目前在许多经济单位和事业单位中，浪费现象仍然十分严重。许多地方和许多部门的非生产性建设仍然过多，工程标准和工程造价仍然过高，原材料的耗费仍然过大。仅据少数企业单位已经检查揭发出来的材料，由于浪费所造成的损失是惊人的。不久以前，报纸上介绍了上海梅林罐头厂工人反浪费专题鸣放的结果：这个厂从一九五四年以来，在原材料、财产、物资、质量事故和劳动力方面的浪费达四十五万元，约等于现有流动资金的一半。可以设想，如果每个企业都像梅林工厂那样把浪费现象揭发出来，并且加以克服，对于社会主义建设会带来多么大的好处。
    毛主席曾经指示我们：“勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。这就是节约的原则，节约是社会主义经济的基本原则之一。中国是一个大国，但是现在还很穷，要使中国富起来，需要几十年时间。几十年以后也需要执行勤俭的原则，但是特别要提倡勤俭，特别要注意节约的，是在目前这几十年内，是在目前这几个五年计划的时期内。”这个指示应该在一切部门一切单位中贯彻执行。
    现在反浪费斗争，已在全国很多单位热烈展开，并且开始得到了巨大的收获。有的单位根据反对保守、反对浪费的精神，重新审查了一九五八年的计划。北京市邮局的上缴利润，一九五七年为一百六十八万元，在拟订一九五八年计划的时候，由于思想保守，强调困难，最初曾经打算订为十四万元。后来经过反复讨论，把许多不必要的开支取消了，同时还想出很多增加收入的办法，这样，它的上缴利润计划就增加到了三百万元。由此可见，由反浪费而节减支出、增加收入的潜力是非常大的。因此，在全国各企业、各部门、各单位，都必须在整风运动中抽出十天左右的时间，专门就反浪费问题展开大鸣大放大争大辩，动员最广大群众的力量同各种浪费现象作不调和的斗争。
    反浪费斗争的一个重要环节是清理仓库。国务院决定，各地方、各部门都必须在今年内对于所属一切仓库实行一次全面的清理，以便切实弄清家底，把一切积压在仓角库底的物资清查出来，加以利用。
    我们在前面已经说到，对于全国各项事业费应该大力加以整顿。凡是可以紧缩的机构必须坚决紧缩，凡是可以合并的机构必须坚决合并，可以减少的人员必须坚决减少，可以降低的开支标准必须坚决降低，以便腾出大量资金发展生产建设。这是一九五八年各地方、各部门的一项重大任务，必须认真进行。
    一九五八年的另一项重大任务是大力节减国家机关的费用，包括行政管理费用和国防费用。毛主席早在一九五零年就曾经提出，国家机构所需经费的大量节减是我国财政经济状况根本好转的三个条件之一。毛主席的这个指示，对于我们今天的工作仍然适用。从去年开始，国家已经决定紧缩行政机构，大批地下放干部。根据初步的不完全的统计，下放的干部人数包括企业事业单位下放的干部在内，到今年一月十日左右已经达到一百一十万人，下放的人数还在继续增加。这是一项有伟大历史意义的革命措施。这不但使大量干部得到在劳动中和基层工作中锻炼的机会，不但将大大提高国家机关的工作效率，大大减少官僚主义，而且也将大大地节省国家的行政经费，减少社会主义社会中脱离生产的人员，从而有助于促进社会主义建设事业的发展。
    所有上述各项增产节约、反对浪费的任务的实现，都依靠全国各地方、各部门的共同努力。
    在这里，我们还希望再一次引起各地方各部门注意，地方和企业有了钱，应该集中用之于生产建设事业，应该在积极地更快地发展社会主义建设事业的同时，防止资金使用上可能发生的某些分散和浪费现象。国家工作人员应该严格地遵守财政制度和财政纪律。财政部门也应该适应体制改变以后的新情况，改进工作作风，深入现场，加强财政监督工作，努力贯彻增产节约的方针。
    各位代表！我国现在仍然是一个经济上和文化上都落后的国家。为了把我国建设成为一个社会主义的强国，我们必须克勤克俭，以便能把更多的资金投入国家建设中去。为此，中共中央不但提出了勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办合作社、勤俭办一切事业的方针，而且还提出了勤俭持家的方针。节约不仅是全体国家工作人员和经济工作人员的任务，而且是全体人民的共同任务。只有全国上下都努力来增加积累，节约资金，我国的建设事业才能迅速地发展。因此，有必要在全国人民中间广泛地宣传节约，做到家喻户晓，使节约成为社会风气，使人人都能自觉地实行节约。在人民中间提倡节约，这同人民的合理消费和在发展生产的基础上逐步改善生活的正当愿望，是不矛盾的。我们提倡勤俭持家，是要家家户户节约使用我们现在还不富裕的粮食和棉布，是要合作社员注意增加合作社的积累，是要人人注意储蓄，是要反对游手好闲和大吃大喝，反对赌博，反对婚丧节庆中的铺张浪费。国家机关工作人员更应该在勤俭持家方面作出良好的榜样。因此，提倡节约、反对浪费的意义，不但在于积累建设资金，而且在于移风易俗，养成全国人民的优良的生活习惯和道德品质。
    让我们全体国家工作人员、全体经济工作人员同全体人民一致行动起来，鼓起革命干劲，反对保守思想，反对浪费现象，展开大规模的增产节约运动，来迎接第二个五年计划第一年的生产和建设的高潮！依靠全国人民的共同努力，我们一定能够克服任何困难，超额完成为这个高潮服务的一九五八年的国家预算！
