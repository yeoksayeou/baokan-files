Xinhua News Agency Report: The recently held Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Local Industry Conference decided that the autonomous region's local industry should move quickly during the Second Five-Year Plan to catch up with or surpass the autonomous region's total agricultural and animal husbandry output value.

In 1957, the total output value of Inner Mongolia's local industry was 590 million yuan, and the total output value of agriculture and animal husbandry was more than 1.42 billion yuan. Five years later, local industry will reach more than 2.9 billion yuan, which is more than 100 million yuan higher than the estimated agricultural and animal husbandry output value for the same period. After fifteen days of repeated discussions and research, the representatives attending the meeting unanimously believed that as long as the conservative thinking of leaders at all levels is overcome and the revolutionary zeal of all ethnic groups is stimulated, the autonomous region can fully achieve the above requirements.

The meeting focused on discussing the issues of the whole Party and the entire people running industry diligently and frugally, all-round blooming in rural, pastoral, and mountainous areas, and actively developing banner and county industries. The meeting required that by 1962, every township should have industry and every commune should have industry, and every township should have electric lighting. It required that the autonomous region's more than 2,340 townships reach an average industrial output value of 140,000 yuan per township by 1962, and an industrial output value of 30,000 yuan per agricultural cooperative. In addition to fully utilizing the potential of existing enterprises, the region will also build more than 500 new enterprises within five years, mainly developing small-scale metal mining and processing, non-metal mining and processing, small-scale dairy products, sugar making, grain and rice processing, and local specialty processing, and other local industries that use local materials and sell locally.

In order to adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in local industry, the meeting also focused on studying how to strengthen industrial leadership, the industrial system, explore resources, and vigorously train technical talents.

    全党全民勤俭办工业　农村牧区山区全面开花
    内蒙古地方工业迎头追赶农牧业
    五年后地方工业总产值将超过农牧业一亿元以上
    据新华社讯　最近举行的内蒙古自治区地方工业会议决定自治区地方工业要在第二个五年计划期间快马加鞭，迎头赶上或超过自治区的农牧业总产值。
    1957年，内蒙古地方工业的总产值是五点九亿元，农牧业总产值是十四亿二千多万元，五年之后，地方工业将达到二十九亿多元，比同期预计的农牧业总产值高出一亿元以上。参加会议的代表经过十五天反复讨论研究后，一致认为只要克服各级领导的保守思想，鼓足各族人民的革命干劲，自治区完全可以实现上述要求。
    会议着重讨论了自治区全党、全民勤俭办工业和在农村、牧区、山区全面开花，积极发展旗县工业等问题。会议要求到1962年做到乡乡有工业，社社有工业，每个乡都有电灯照明。要求自治区的二千三百四十多个乡，到1962年平均每乡工业产值达到十四万元，每个农业社的工业产值达到三万元。除了充分发挥现有企业的潜力外，全区还将在五年内新建企业五百多个，主要是发展小型的金属开采和加工、非金属开采和加工、小型乳品、制糖、粮米加工和土特产加工等就地取材、就地销售的地方工业。
    为适应地方工业大跃进的新形势，会议还着重研究了如何加强工业领导，工业体制，探清资源，大力培养技术人才等问题。
