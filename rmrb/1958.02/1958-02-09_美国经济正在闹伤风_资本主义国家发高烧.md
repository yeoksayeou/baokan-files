　　Xinhua News Agency, 7th: New York dispatch: The International Labour Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations, released a report on the evening of the 5th stating that in 1957, the number of unemployed people in capitalist countries generally increased, prices continued to rise, and workers' real wages decreased.
　　This report was compiled based on materials provided by eighty-five countries, with most of the figures cited being from the fourth quarter of last year.
　　Unemployment Numbers Generally Surge
　　The report said that in 1957, the number of unemployed people in many capitalist countries experienced an "unsettling rapid increase," and "the unemployment trend in North America is causing particular concern." The report pointed out that "the United States is currently experiencing an economic recession," which is bound to "have an impact" on other capitalist countries.
　　The report said that from November 1956 to November 1957, the number of unemployed people in Canada and the Netherlands more than doubled. The rates of increase in unemployment in other capitalist countries during the same period were: Finland 82%; Sweden 43%; Belgium 34%; the United States 24%; the United Kingdom and Switzerland 19%; Norway 13%; West Germany 11%.
　　In Asia and South America, "a large number of unemployed people also constitute a persistent economic and social problem." For example, the number of unemployed people in India increased by 17%, and in Ceylon by 16%. Although the recent number of employed people in the Philippines, Japan, and Burma has increased or the number of unemployed people has decreased, "the unemployment problem remains a serious problem."
　　Prices Rise, Wages Fall
　　The report pointed out that in 1957, the average price of consumer goods in capitalist countries rose by 3.7% (the largest price increase since the early days of the Korean War in 1950), while nominal wages only rose by an average of 2.5%, so workers' real wages fell. The report said that many capitalist countries are currently in a state of inflation. Among the eighty-five countries that provided materials, seventy-three countries saw prices rise, with South American countries experiencing the most severe price increases. The price increases in some countries were: Bolivia's prices rose by 152% in one year, Argentina and Indonesia 31%, Mexico 13%, France 10.1%, the United Kingdom 4.5%, the United States 3.1%, Canada 2.5%, and Denmark 2%.
　　The report said that not only real wages but also nominal wages have decreased in many capitalist countries. For example, due to the "general trend of reduced economic activity," the working hours of workers in the United States, Canada, West Germany, and the United Kingdom have been reduced, which has resulted in a corresponding reduction in workers' weekly income.
　　Homelessness, Families Separated
　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Eleven social welfare organizations in Montreal said on the 7th that the normal lives of Canadians have been severely disrupted due to increased unemployment. It is believed that the unemployment figures in Canada have far exceeded the earlier estimated 750,000 people.
　　These organizations said that there are more and more young people who eat at soup kitchens, who are well-dressed but penniless; many families have been forced to move out of their original homes because they cannot afford the rent; mothers are sending their children to orphanages so that they can continue to have food to eat, and police stations are filled with homeless people every night.

### 美国经济正在闹伤风  资本主义国家发高烧

　　美国经济正在闹伤风  资本主义国家发高烧
    新华社7日讯　纽约消息：联合国的专门机构国际劳工组织5日晚上发表的一个报告说，在1957年，资本主义国家的失业人数普遍增加、物价不断上涨，工人的实际工资减少。
    这个报告是根据八十五个国家提供的材料编成的，材料引用的数字大部分是去年第四季的数字。
    失业人数普遍激增
    报告说，在1957年，许多资本主义国家的失业人数有了“令人不安的迅速增加”，“北美的失业趋势引起人们特别的忧虑”。报告指出，“美国目前正在经历着一次经济衰退”，这个衰退势将对其他资本主义国家“产生影响”。
    报告说，从1956年11月到1957年11月，加拿大和荷兰的失业人数增加一倍以上。其他资本主义国家在同一时期失业人数增加的比率是：芬兰82％；瑞典43％；比利时34％；美国24％；英国和瑞士19％；挪威13％；西德11％。
    在亚洲和南美，“大批的失业者也构成了一种持久性的经济和社会问题”。例如印度失业人数增加了17％，锡兰增加了16％。菲律宾、日本和缅甸最近的就业人数虽然有增加或者失业人数有减少，“但是失业问题仍然是一个严重的问题”。
    物价上升　工资下降
    报告指出，在1957年，资本主义国家的消费品价格平均上涨了3.7％，（这是1950年朝鲜战争初期以来物价上涨最多的一年），而名义工资平均只上涨2.5％，因此工人的实际工资下降了。报告说，目前许多资本主义国家都陷入通货膨胀的局面，在提供材料的八十五个国家中，有七十三个国家的物价上涨了，其中尤以南美国家的物价上涨得最厉害。一些国家的物价上涨情况是：玻利维亚的物价在一年内上涨了152％、阿根廷和印度尼西亚31％、墨西哥13％、法国10.1％、英国4.5％、美国3.1％、加拿大2.5％、丹麦2％。
    报告说，不但实际工资，而且名义工资在许多资本主义国家也减少了。例如由于“经济活动减少的总的趋势”，美国、加拿大、西德和英国的工人工作时间已经减少，这就使得工人每周的收入也跟着减少。
    无家可归　骨肉离散
    新华社8日讯　蒙特利尔的十一个社会福利机构7日说，由于失业增加，加拿大人的正常生活受到了严重的破坏。人们认为，加拿大的失业数字已经远远超过早些时候估计的七十五万人。
    这些机构说，在施济处吃饭的穿着不差然而束中不名一文的青年愈来愈多了，许多家庭因为纳不起房租而被迫搬出了原来的住所；母亲们正在把孩子送给孤儿院以便他们可以继续有饭吃，警察局每夜塞满了无家可归的人。
