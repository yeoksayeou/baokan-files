Taking National Characteristics into Account Cannot Deviate from the Socialist Direction
Representative Huang Zhengqing Reports on the Socialist Transformation of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

I completely agree with the reports and various drafts of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

Under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, the people of all ethnic groups in Gansu Province have victoriously completed the First Five-Year Plan and are now entering the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan with full confidence. Over the past five years, all sectors of Gansu's national economy have achieved comprehensive and significant development. The living standards of people of all ethnic groups have improved markedly.

Taking our Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture as an example, a series of achievements have been made in terms of production development, living standard improvement, and health condition improvement. Taking the Shangkajia Tufang Administrative Village in Xiahe County as an example, among the 52 Tibetan herding households in this village, only 4 had enough to eat before 1951, while 48 did not. By 1957, except for two households, the rest no longer worried about food. Such examples are numerous in our Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Now, the entire prefecture presents a scene of peace, prosperity, and happiness. When drinking water, think of its source. The people of all ethnic groups in Gannan truly thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of their hearts.

Ripe Melon Falls Naturally, Water Flows into a Ditch - Socialist Transformation Develops Healthily

The new atmosphere in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is not only reflected in economic prosperity and improved living standards, but also in the strengthening of national unity and the raising of people's awareness. Especially after the large-scale socialist education and patriotic education in 1957, the people of all ethnic groups in Gannan increasingly deeply realized that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, uniting as one, and building a socialist motherland is the only path to happiness for all our ethnic groups. The socialist enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in Gannan is prominently manifested in the rapid development of the cooperative movement in the past two months. At the end of July 1957, the agricultural households participating in cooperatives in the agricultural areas of Gannan accounted for more than 50 percent of the total number of agricultural households in the prefecture; recently, the number of households joining the cooperatives has increased to about 70 percent of the total number of agricultural households. Areas such as Zhuoni have basically realized the agricultural cooperation. In terms of the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, in the past, only some animal husbandry mutual aid teams were established in the pastoral areas of Gannan. Recently, animal husbandry cooperatives have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, having developed to forty-eight, and are still continuing to develop. In Xiahe County alone, there was only one agricultural cooperative in the past, but in a short period of more than a month, twenty-five animal husbandry cooperatives and one hundred and thirty-one agricultural cooperatives have been established. These facts vividly show that the socialist transformation cause in the Gannan area is developing healthily. The ripe melon falling naturally and water flowing into a ditch is not far away.

In the past, many people had serious right-leaning conservative ideas about the socialist transformation in the Gannan area, especially the socialist transformation in the pastoral areas. They always overemphasized the backwardness of the pastoral areas' economy and culture, the vastness of the area, the dispersion of the population, and other difficulties, while ignoring the enthusiasm of the vast number of herdsmen to develop production, improve their lives, and take the socialist road. Therefore, they adopted a passive waiting attitude towards socialist transformation, instead of actively leading and creating conditions. Now it seems that they have indeed fallen behind the situation and behind the masses. I did not have a clear understanding of this in the past, and I am only beginning to understand it now.

On the road of the Gannan area advancing towards socialism, there are difficulties. At present, the main problem is that some people still have various concerns and doubts in their minds because they do not understand socialism. Therefore, we should further strengthen socialist education, adhere to the method of persuasion, present the facts, and reason things out. At the same time, we must also run the existing cooperatives well, especially the animal husbandry cooperatives, so that both people and livestock are prosperous, making everyone realize that organizing is indeed better than working individually, and thus consciously embark on the socialist road.

Those Who Truly Love the Country and Care About the Interests of Their Own Ethnic Group Should Accept and Support Socialism

When carrying out socialist transformation in minority areas, we should pay full attention to taking into account national characteristics. This is completely correct and is clearly stipulated in our Constitution. However, taking national characteristics into account does not mean that we can deviate from the socialist direction. Building socialism is the common will and common aspiration of all ethnic groups, and it is also a common goal of struggle. The timing may be earlier or later, the methods may be different, but the overall goal is completely consistent. If we do not first adhere to the major premise of socialism, taking national characteristics into account becomes meaningless. If we do not make this clear, we will lose our way forward. Here, it should be particularly pointed out that a very small number of people with ulterior motives use the guise of national characteristics to make an issue of it, attempting to obstruct socialist transformation and keep minority ethnic groups in a state of poverty and backwardness forever. This is something we cannot tolerate. Such people should be severely criticized to make them wake up properly.

Socialism is the general trend and the desire of the people. All those who truly love the country and truly care about the interests of their own ethnic group should accept socialism and support socialism. Because socialism not only conforms to the interests of our motherland, but also conforms to the interests of our own ethnic group. In particular, representatives of our minority ethnic groups should set a good example and become a veritable revolutionary force for progress, so as not to betray the trust of the motherland and the people in us. Our support for socialism cannot be just lip service, but must be from the heart, supported by practical actions, and play a leading role. In the future, in addition to working hard to promote socialism, encouraging the socialist enthusiasm of the masses, and supporting the socialist transformation cause in the Gannan area, I have also decided to apply for the implementation of joint state-private ownership of a pasture I originally owned in Maqu County, and to raise funds together to build a hydroelectric power plant in Xiahe County. I am doing this, on the one hand, to show my sincerity in supporting socialism, and on the other hand, to hope that it can play a role in promoting the socialist transformation cause in the Gannan area. At the same time, it is also very beneficial to my personal transformation.

Actively Do What is Conducive to National Unity; Resolutely Oppose What is Detrimental to National Unity

It is fundamentally impossible to carry out socialist transformation and socialist construction in minority areas without the help of the Han people and Han cadres. The facts of the past few years in the Gannan area have proven that it is precisely because the Han people and Han cadres have given us great support and help in all aspects that we have been able to achieve significant development in politics, economy, and culture. The vast majority of Han cadres working in the Gannan area work diligently, sincerely help the people of minority ethnic groups, and closely unite and cooperate with cadres of minority ethnic groups. In particular, in the past few years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, Han cadres have repeatedly received communist education, criticized Han chauvinism, further improved their understanding, and strengthened national unity.

However, some people in our Gannan Tibetan ethnic group do not have such views. Harboring local nationalism, they even obliterate facts, confuse right and wrong, and unreasonably reject Han cadres, saying that since it is a Tibetan autonomous prefecture, it can only be managed by Tibetan cadres and does not need a single Han cadre. They do not share the same heart and mind with Han cadres, but are estranged from them; some long for Han cadres to leave quickly day and night, and deliberately make things difficult for Han cadres in their work. Individual people even wear the cloak of ethnicity, incite national disunity, and ambitiously want to engage in national division. Obviously, if this situation continues to develop, there will be a danger of splitting the unity of the motherland, undermining national unity, and falling into the enemy's trap and being used by the enemy, which must arouse our serious vigilance. Therefore, at present, in minority areas, while continuing to criticize Han chauvinism, focusing on criticizing local nationalism is completely necessary and correct. Representatives of our minority ethnic groups should have full awareness, examine themselves well, help others, strive to eliminate the influence of local nationalist ideas, and raise their socialist awareness. In the future, we should actively do whatever is conducive to national unity, and we should resolutely oppose whatever is detrimental to national unity. We must firmly adhere to this principle without the slightest wavering.

In order to jointly build our prosperous and happy socialist motherland family, the people of all our ethnic groups must unite more closely, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, exert full effort, ride the wind and waves, and bravely advance towards a great future.

Please criticize and correct my speech, fellow representatives.

### 照顾民族特点不能离开社会主义方向  黄正清代表报告甘南藏族地区社会主义改造情况

　　照顾民族特点不能离开社会主义方向
    黄正清代表报告甘南藏族地区社会主义改造情况
    我完全同意李先念、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长、吴玉章主任的报告和各项草案。
    我们甘肃省各族人民在中共中央和国务院的英明领导下，已经胜利地完成了第一个五年计划，现在又满怀信心地进入了第二个五年计划的第一年。过去五年期间，我们甘肃国民经济各个部门，都获得了全面的巨大发展。各族人民的生活得到了显著的改善。
    拿我们甘南藏族自治州来说，不论在生产的发展，生活的提高，健康状况的改善等方面，都取得了一系列的成就。以夏河县上卡加土房行政村为例，这个村子的五十二户藏族牧民，一九五一年以前，够吃的只有四户，四十八户不够吃，到一九五七年，除了有两户以外，其余的再不愁吃了。这样的事例，在我们甘南藏族自治州是很多的。现在，全州到处呈现着一片安居乐业繁荣幸福的景象。饮水思源，我们甘南各族人民真是从心坎里感激共产党和毛主席。
    瓜熟蒂落水到渠成　社会主义改造健康发展
    甘南藏族自治州的新气象，不仅表现在经济繁荣和人民生活改善方面，同时还表现在民族团结的加强和人民觉悟的提高方面。特别是经过一九五七年的大规模的社会主义教育和爱国主义教育，甘南各族人民愈来愈深刻地体会到，只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，团结一致，建成社会主义的祖国大家庭，才是我们各族人民唯一的幸福的道路。甘南各族人民的社会主义积极性，突出地表现为最近两个月来合作化运动的迅速发展。在一九五七年七月底，甘南农业区参加合作社的农户，占全州总农户数的百分之五十多；最近入社农户已经增加到占总农户数的百分之七十左右。卓尼等地区已经基本上实现了农业的合作化。在畜牧业的社会主义改造方面，过去甘南牧区只试办了一些畜牧互助组，最近以来，畜牧业合作社就好像雨后春笋一样，已经发展到四十八个，还在继续发展。单是夏河一县，过去只有一个农业合作社，在短短一个多月以来，就建立了二十五个畜牧业合作社，一百三十一个农业合作社。这些事实生动地表明，甘南地区的社会主义改造事业正在健康地向前发展。瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成，已在不远了。
    过去，不少人对甘南地区的社会主义改造，特别是牧区的社会主义改造，有着严重的右倾保守思想。总是过分强调牧区经济文化落后，地区辽阔，人口分散等等困难，而忽略了广大牧民迫切要求发展生产，改善生活，走社会主义道路的积极性。因而，就对社会主义改造抱着消极等待态度，而不去积极领导，创造条件。现在看来，确是落在形势后面，落在群众后面了。这一点，我过去也是认识得不够清楚的，现在才开始明白过来了。
    在甘南地区向社会主义前进的道路上，不是没有困难的。目前主要是有一部分人，因为对社会主义还不了解，思想上还有种种的顾虑和怀疑。因此，我们应当进一步加强社会主义教育工作，坚持用说服的办法，摆事实，讲道理。同时，还要办好现有的合作社，特别是畜牧业合作社，做到人畜两旺，使大家认识到组织起来的确比单干好，从而自觉地走上社会主义道路。
    真正爱国和关心本民族利益的人就应接受社会主义拥护社会主义
    在少数民族地区进行社会主义改造的时候，应当充分注意照顾民族的特点。这是完全正确的，也是我们的宪法所明确规定的。但是，照顾民族特点，并不是说就可以离开社会主义方向。建设社会主义是各族人民的共同意志和共同愿望，也是共同的奋斗目标。时间纵有迟早，方法纵有差别，而总的目标则是完全一致的。如果不首先坚持社会主义这个大前提，照顾民族特点也就变得毫无意义了。如果不明确这一点，我们就会迷失前进的方向。这里，特别应当指出，有极少数别有用心的人，利用民族特点的幌子，借题发挥，企图阻挠社会主义改造，使少数民族永远陷于贫困落后的境地。这是我们所不能容忍的。对于这样的人，应当严肃地给予批判，使他们好好地清醒过来。
    社会主义是大势所趋，人心所向。凡是真正爱国的，真正关心本民族利益的人，就应当接受社会主义，拥护社会主义。因为社会主义不但符合我们祖国的利益，而且符合我们本民族的利益。特别是我们少数民族的代表人士，更应当做出良好的榜样，使自己成为一个名副其实的革命促进派，才不至于辜负祖国和人民对我们的信任。我们拥护社会主义，不能只是口头上的拥护，而要从心里拥护，要用实际行动来支持，要起带头作用。我自己今后除了努力宣传社会主义，鼓励群众的社会主义积极性，支持甘南地区的社会主义改造事业以外，还决定把我在玛曲县原有的一个牧场，申请实行公私合营，并且同大家集资建设夏河县水电厂。我这样做，一方面是为了表示我拥护社会主义的诚意，另一方面，也希望对甘南地区的社会主义改造事业，能够起一些促进作用。同时，对我个人的改造，也是有许多好处的。
    有利民族团结的就积极去做　不利民族团结的就坚决反对
    在少数民族地区进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设，如果没有汉族和汉族干部的帮助，是根本不可能的。甘南地区几年来的事实证明，正是因为汉族和汉族干部从各方面给了我们以极大的支持和帮助，才使我们能够在政治上、经济上和文化上得到重大的发展。在甘南地区工作的绝大多数汉族干部，都是勤勤恳恳地工作，诚心诚意地帮助少数民族人民，并且同少数民族干部亲密地团结合作。特别是几年来在共产党和人民政府领导下，对汉族干部反复地进行了共产主义教育，批判了大汉族主义，更加提高了汉族干部的认识，加强了民族团结。
    但是，在我们甘南藏族中，却有些人不是这样的看法。他们怀着地方民族主义的情绪，竟然抹煞事实，混淆事非，无理地排斥汉族干部，说什么既然是藏族的自治州，就只能由藏族干部来管理，不要一个汉族干部。他们对待汉族干部不是同心同德，而是离心离德；有的日夜盼望汉族干部快快离开，并且在工作中故意同汉族干部为难。个别人甚至披着民族外衣，挑拨民族团结，野心勃勃地想搞民族分裂。显然，这种情况如果发展下去，就有分裂祖国统一、破坏民族团结的危险，就有上敌人的当、被敌人利用的危险，必须引起我们的严重警惕。因此，目前在少数民族地区，在继续批判大汉族主义的同时，着重地批判地方民族主义，这是完全必要的和正确的。我们少数民族的代表人士，应当有充分的自觉，很好地检查自己，帮助别人，努力清除地方民族主义思想的影响，提高社会主义觉悟。今后只要是有利于民族团结的，我们就应当积极去做，凡是不利于民族团结的，我们就应当坚决反对。这个原则，我们必须切实信守，不可有丝毫的动摇。
    为了共同建设我们繁荣幸福的社会主义祖国大家庭，我们各族人民必须更加紧密地团结起来，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，鼓足干劲，乘风破浪，向着伟大的未来奋勇前进。
    我的发言，请各位代表批评指正。
