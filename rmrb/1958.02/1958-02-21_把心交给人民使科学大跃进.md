Surrender Your Hearts to the People and Promote a Great Leap Forward in Science
Scientists at the Academy of Sciences Conference Emphasize Ideological Transformation as the Prerequisite for Scientific Leap Forward
Xinhua News Agency, 20th - The Chinese Academy of Sciences held a meeting of institute directors in Beijing from February 13th to 15th to deploy a great leap forward in scientific work. This is a great mobilization of Chinese scientific workers to ride the waves and quickly catch up with international advanced levels.

The eight encouraging sentences proposed by President Guo Moruo and Vice President Zhang Jingfu at the meeting represent the common language of the scientists and scientific leaders present. These eight sentences are: Boost enthusiasm, More, Faster, Better, Economical, One heart, One mind, Both red and expert, Value labor, Obey organization, Strengthen cooperation, Realize planning.

Guo Moruo called on scientific workers to exert all their strength to promote a great leap forward in science. He said that the National Science and Technology Twelve-Year Development Plan, which began to be formulated in 1956, proposed to approach or catch up with the world's advanced levels in certain urgently needed and important departments within twelve years, which is actually the slogan of the Great Leap Forward. The past two years have made many preparations for the great leap forward in science and technology: the long-term plan has been gradually implemented, especially the emergency measures for new technologies are underway; the State Council has established a Scientific Planning Commission, which has done a lot of scientific coordination and organization work; the scientific team has been strengthened, and the number of scientific cadres has increased significantly in the past two years; scientific workers have made great progress in ideological awareness after the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle; and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries has developed to a new stage. Guo Moruo said that the country's first five-year plan has been overfulfilled, providing better equipment for science and technology; the country's need for the development of scientific undertakings has greatly increased. Now scientific workers are not in a situation where heroes have no place to use their talents, but rather that the land has no place for heroes to use their talents!

The scientists attending the meeting listened to President Guo Moruo conveying Chairman Mao's instructions, Vice President Zhang Jingfu's opening speech, Deputy Secretary-General Du Runsheng's report on the road of the Soviet scientific cause overcoming numerous difficulties and leaping to the forefront of the world in many aspects at an astonishing speed, and Deputy Secretary-General Yu Wen conveying Premier Zhou's instructions on cultural and educational work. They then spoke at the meeting, expressing their revolutionary enthusiasm and belief in the leap forward in scientific work. The scientists cited many facts to demonstrate that scientific work, like industrial and agricultural production, can completely adopt the "more, faster, better, and more economical" method to achieve a great leap forward. Almost every speaker unanimously emphasized that the ideological leap forward of scientific workers is the prerequisite for the scientific leap forward, and the key to the scientific great leap forward lies in the ideological transformation of scientific workers, and the ideological transformation of veteran scientists is especially important. Zhao Jiuzhang, director of the Institute of Geophysics, pointed out that the central issue in all issues of the Great Leap Forward is how to maximize the use of human and material resources, and the key issue here lies in the ideological transformation and ideological leap forward of scientists. He said: Scientists used to think with "I" as the center, but now it should be with the collective as the center. In the past, some people nominally worked for socialism, but in reality, they were still centered on "I." This is the struggle between two roads, the struggle between the old and the new roads. This problem cannot be solved without a leap forward. Qian Xuesen said that the best way to run all undertakings, including scientific research, is to mobilize everyone and rely on everyone. How to mobilize everyone is a difficult problem, because there are still personal plans among us, so we will use our energy in the wrong place. Many scientists believe that a good way to carry out ideological transformation is for everyone to surrender their hearts to their comrades and to the Party. Feng Depei, director of the Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry, believes that surrendering one's heart to the Party is one of the magic weapons for solving all difficulties in the great leap forward in science. Qian Xuesen said that if everyone surrenders their heart to the 600 million people, then everyone's strength is equal to the strength of the 600 million people!

The scientists at the meeting issued enthusiastic and bold words. Gong Zutong, deputy director of the Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, proposed "hard work for five years, and strive to catch up with the world's advanced level in the main aspects of optical precision machinery and instruments two years ahead of schedule (that is, within eight years)." This research institute has made considerable progress during the first five-year plan period. Zhang Dayu, director of the Petroleum Research Institute, said that in five or seven years, China will far exceed Britain, West Germany, and the United States in the production of shale oil and water gas synthetic petroleum, and the scientific research work in these two areas should naturally reach the international level. Qian Sanqiang, director of the Institute of Physics, reported on the results of the Institute of Physics' inspection of the accelerator construction work. This inspection shows that the completion of the accelerator indicates that China's nuclear physics has taken a step forward, and the scientists leading this work and the personnel involved have made certain contributions. However, due to the shortcomings in the leadership work and the scientists' thinking, the research work was delayed and the waste of human and material resources was caused. This fact shows that if the leadership improves its style and the scientists' ideological transformation is good, the efficiency of the research work can be greatly improved. Scientists talked about the difficulties that may be encountered in the scientific leap forward. They all said that they knew that there were many difficulties ahead, but they were relaxed and happy because they had a hundred times the courage and confidence to overcome the difficulties, and they were highly optimistic.

Zhang Jingfu, Secretary of the Party Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a speech on the last day of the meeting. He summarized everyone's opinions at the meeting and put forward twenty-four questions for all personnel to study, preparing to concentrate them into a program of common struggle, in order to point out the way for the great leap forward in scientific work. The main contents of these questions are: After the basic victory of the struggle between the two roads, it is necessary to carry out the struggle between the two methods—"more, faster, better, and more economical" and "less, slower, worse, and more expensive"; leap forward under two conditions: one is to leap forward under the existing conditions, and the other is to leap forward under the conditions of improving conditions and increasing strength; formulate an outline of the ten-year plan of the Academy of Sciences as a business direction; scientific work must clarify the social purpose, and it is necessary to improve the scientific level by solving the tasks proposed in economic and cultural construction, rather than abstractly improving the level; focus on development and comprehensively arrange strength; combine science and technology; various disciplines should penetrate each other and pay attention to the development of marginal sciences; each research institution should immediately put forward a specific plan and determine the central scientific problems and key measures during the second five-year plan; on the premise of ensuring the national research tasks, appropriately support the scientific tasks put forward by the local government; resolutely learn from the Soviet Union, complete the tasks proposed in the cooperation agreement between the Chinese and Soviet Academies of Sciences, and other international cooperation tasks; strengthen the cooperation between the Academy of Sciences, universities and industrial departments, and support each other; further rectify the work style and transform the thinking; establish a scientific team that is both red and expert; scientific workers should meet each other's thoughts, surrender their hearts to their comrades, and strengthen unity; scientific workers should regard themselves as ordinary workers and eliminate the private ownership of knowledge; in order to develop socialism and materialism, it is necessary to continue to implement the "double hundred" policy and criticize bourgeois academic ideas; leading cadres at all levels of the Academy of Sciences should go deep into the grassroots, inspect and evaluate work, and on this basis, grasp the advanced and backward ends and drive the middle; run science diligently and thriftily; the three systems of scientific work—research, technology (including factory production), and administration—should form a unified organic whole, and the erroneous idea of "only research is high" should be criticized; train academic secretaries at all levels and other scientific organization personnel; rely on the masses; strengthen leadership, and the directors (heads of offices) of each research institute must first play a commanding role; quickly draft the regulations of the Academy.

President Guo Moruo made a concluding speech, gave important instructions to scientific workers, and greatly encouraged all the scientific workers present.

The meeting also discussed the second five-year plan and this year's research plan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the spirit of the Great Leap Forward.

    把心交给人民使科学大跃进
    科学家在科学院会议上强调思想改造是科学跃进的前提
    新华社20日讯　中国科学院在2月13日到15日在北京举行研究所所长会议，部署科学工作大跃进。这是中国科学工作者乘风破浪，迅速赶上国际先进水平的一次大动员。
    院长郭沫若和副院长张劲夫在会上提出的八句勉励语，代表了与会科学家和科学领导干部的共同语言。这八句是：鼓起干劲、多快好省、一心一德、又红又专、重视劳动、服从组织、加强合作、实现规划。
    郭沫若号召科学工作者拿出吃奶的气力来，促使科学大跃进。他说，1956年开始制订的全国科学技术十二年发展远景规划，提出在十二年内在某些急需部门和重要部门接近或赶上世界先进水平，实际上就是大跃进的口号。过去的两年为科学技术大跃进作了许多准备工作：远景规划已在逐步实现，特别是新技术的紧急措施正在进行；国务院成立了科学规划委员会，做了很多科学协调和组织工作；加强了科学队伍，两年来科学干部已有显著增加；科学工作者经过整风运动和反右派斗争，思想觉悟已有很大进步；同苏联及其他兄弟国家的合作发展到了新阶段。郭沫若说，国家第一个五年计划已超额完成，为科学技术提供了更好的装备；国家对科学事业发展的需要已经大大增加，现在科学工作者不是英雄无用武之地，而是地无用武之英雄了！
    参加会议的科学家听取了院长郭沫若传达毛主席的指示、副院长张劲夫的开幕辞、副秘书长杜润生报告苏联科学事业克服重重困难后以惊人速度在许多方面跃居世界首位的道路以及副秘书长郁文传达周总理对文教工作的指示后，纷纷在会上发言，表达了各人的革命干劲和对于科学工作跃进的信念。科学家们举出了许多事实来论证科学工作和工农业生产一样，完全可以采取“多快好省”的方法来一个大跃进。几乎每一个人的发言都不约而同地强调科学工作者的思想跃进是科学跃进的前提，科学大跃进的关键在于科学工作者的思想改造，而老科学家的思想改造尤其重要。地球物理研究所所长赵九章指出，大跃进中一切问题中的中心问题是怎样最大限度地发挥人力物力，而这里的关键问题又在于科学家的思想改造、思想大跃进。他说：科学家从前想的是以“我”为中心，而现在应该是以集体为中心。过去有人虽然口头上是为着社会主义，而实际上还是以“我”为中心。这就是两条道路的斗争，新旧道路的斗争。这个问题不解决就不能跃进。钱学森说，办一切事业的最好办法，包括科学研究在内，是发动大家，依靠大家。怎样发动大家，是一个不易作到的问题，因为我们中间还有个人打算，这样就会把劲头用错了地方。许多科学家的发言都认为进行思想改造的好方法是大家把心交给同志们、交给党。生理生化研究所所长冯德培认为把心交给党是解决科学大跃进中一切困难的法宝之一。钱学森说，如果每个人把心交给六亿人民，那末每个人的力量就等于六亿人民的力量！
    科学家们在会上发出了干劲横溢的豪语。光学精密机械仪器研究所副所长龚祖同提出“苦干五年，争取提前两年（即在八年内）在光学精密机械仪器的主要方面赶上世界先进水平”。这个研究所在第一个五年计划期间已有长足发展。石油研究所所长张大煜说，在五年、七年之后，我国在页岩油、水煤气合成石油生产方面将远远超过英国、西德和美国，这两方面的科学研究工作自然也应达到国际水平。物理研究所所长钱三强报告了物理所检查加速器建造工作的结果。这次检查表明：加速器的完成表示我国原子核物理已经前进了一步，领导这一工作的科学家和参与工作的人员都有一定贡献。但是由于领导工作和科学家思想上的缺点，使研究工作延缓了时间，造成了人力物力的浪费。这个事实说明如果领导上改进作风，科学家的思想改造好了，研究工作的效率是可以大大提高的。科学家们谈到了科学跃进中可能碰到的困难，他们都表示明知前面困难很多，但是心情轻松愉快，因为他们有百倍勇气和信心克服困难，他们是高度乐观主义的。
    中共中国科学院党组书记张劲夫在会议最后一天作了发言。他归纳了会上大家的意见，提出了二十四个问题，提供全体人员进行研究，准备集中起来成为共同斗争的纲领，以便为科学工作大跃进指明道路。这些问题的主要内容是：在两条道路的斗争基本胜利后，还要进行两种方法——“多快好省”和“少慢差费”的斗争；在两种条件下跃进：一种是在现有条件下跃进，一种是改善条件增加力量下跃进；制订科学院十年规划纲要，作为业务方向；科学工作要明确社会目的性，要通过解决经济文化建设中提出的任务来提高科学水平，而不是抽象地提高水平；重点发展，全面安排力量；科学与技术结合；各个学科要互相渗透，注意发展边缘科学；各研究机构立即提出具体计划，确定第二个五年计划期间的中心科学问题和重点措施；在保证国家研究任务的前提下，适当支援地方上所提出的科学任务；坚决学习苏联，完成中苏两国科学院合作协议中提出的任务，以及其他国际合作任务；加强科学院、高等学校和产业部门之间的合作，互相支援；进一步整顿作风，改造思想；建立一支又红又专的科学队伍；科学工作人员思想见面，把心交给同志们，加强团结；科学工作者要以普通工人自居，消灭知识私有制；为了发展社会主义和唯物主义，要继续贯彻百家争鸣方针，批判资产阶级学术思想；科学院各级领导干部要深入基层，检查和评比工作，在这基础上抓先进、落后两头，带动中间；勤俭办科学；科学工作的三个系统——研究、技术（包括工厂生产）、行政要组成统一的有机体，要批判“唯有研究高”的错误思想；培养各级学术秘书和其他科学组织工作人员；依靠群众；加强领导，各研究所所长（室主任）首先要起统帅作用；迅速起草院章。
    院长郭沫若最后作了总结讲话，对科学工作者作了重要指示，对到会的全体科学工作者起了很大鼓舞作用。
    会议同时以大跃进的精神，讨论了中国科学院第二个五年计划和今年的研究计划。
