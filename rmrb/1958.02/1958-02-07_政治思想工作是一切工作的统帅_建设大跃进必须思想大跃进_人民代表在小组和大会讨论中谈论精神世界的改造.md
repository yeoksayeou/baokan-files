Xinhua News Agency, 6th: In the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, we must also carry out a Great Leap Forward in thought in one go. This is a top priority issue emphasized by the National People's Congress representatives in recent group discussions and contacts with reporters. The representatives continued to hold group meetings this morning. They pointed out that the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle brought about a Great Leap Forward in production and construction, greatly changing people's thinking and mental outlook; however, politics is the commander, the soul, in order to adapt to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in construction, we must further strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party, strengthen political and ideological work, and strengthen the transformation of thought, so that people can make a Great Leap Forward in thought.

　　Xuyong County takes Rightists to the Mountains to Let Them See the Tide of Socialism

During the rectification movement, Rightists rampantly attacked the leadership of the Communist Party and the cause of socialism. Now, the great development of the socialist cause has powerfully refuted the Rightists' slanders. Luo Wencai, Deputy County Head of Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, used vivid examples to illustrate the great effect produced by the combination of the Party and the masses. He mentioned that during the rectification in this county last year, Rightists vilified the Party's leadership in all aspects. They demanded the abolition of the Party's County Committee, saying that the County Committee's leadership of farmers' production was a deception, and they spread pessimistic and disappointing sentiments everywhere. However, the broad masses of working people trusted the Party's wise leadership. After great debates, the people of the county decided to vigorously increase grain production and advance towards the barren mountains. The County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in this county resolutely changed its work style, overcame right-leaning conservative ideas, and drafted a plan to conquer the barren mountains. The County Party Secretary, the County Head, and the District Party Secretaries personally led tens of thousands of farmers, urban residents, and office cadres to advance towards the barren mountains, where tigers, wolves, and jackals roamed and clouds and fog permeated. The slogan they put forward was: "Not afraid of cold, not afraid of hunger, we must make the barren mountains admit their mistake to us." After two months of struggle, they comprehensively transformed two large mountains with a circumference of sixty to seventy *li* and a height of more than eight hundred meters, and reclaimed a large number of wasteland. One of the mountains can increase grain production by 160,000 *jin* this year. This vivid fact gave the Rightists the most powerful counterattack. The county specifically took the Rightists to the mountains in the end to show them the power of the people, the tide of socialism, and the great role of the Party's leadership. Luo Wencai said that this year, the County Committee also plans to conquer five more mountains, increasing grain production in the county by 20 million *jin*.

　　Get Rid of Bureaucratic Air, Go Deep into the Fields, Carry the Telephone, and Shoulder the Hoe to Conduct Vivid Leadership

The representatives affirmed that after the rectification and the anti-Rightist struggle, a significant change was the transformation of the ideological style of leading cadres at all levels. Now, all localities are getting rid of bureaucratic airs and opposing the three bad styles. There are fewer people who put on bureaucratic airs and point fingers in front of the masses. Those leading cadres who were once ridiculed by farmers as "young masters" have also begun to change today. Zhang Tixue, a representative from Hubei Province and Governor of Hubei Province, emphasized that this is a major change. He said that among the cadres at the special district, county, and district levels in Hubei Province, the practice of conducting experimental fields and delving into specific leadership of production has begun to form a trend throughout the province, which is warmly welcomed by farmers. Some counties and districts require all cadres to help farmers deliver one to two loads of manure to the fields before breakfast every day during the winter production upsurge. This practice of helping farmers with production anytime and anywhere has become a regular system in many areas. Zhang Tixue said that before the rectification, the style of cadres connecting with the masses and working hard was once weakened, the trend of emphasizing eating and dressing was somewhat on the rise, and political and ideological work in rural areas was also somewhat relaxed. The achievements of the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle fully prove that political and ideological work is the commander of all work. In the future, we must be vigilant against the rise of arrogance, complacency, and conservative ideas, continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, and persist in carrying out the annual rectification movement to keep all cadres and people forever vigorous.

　　In order to adapt to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in production and thoroughly change the work style, some places organize cadres to visit and learn from advanced areas. Ren Guodong, a representative from Heilongjiang Province and Secretary of the Mudanjiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, recently led some cadres to visit and study in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, and Jiyuan County, Henan Province. Based on the experience of learning, he believes that strengthening political and ideological work, eliminating bureaucratic airs, and changing leadership methods are the decisive links to ensure the leap forward and re-leap forward of agricultural production. He said that when he went to Jiyuan County, he saw that the female Deputy County Head was digging channels on the rocky mountains with the farmers and living on the mountains with the farmers at night. In Hong'an County, they searched for three days before finding the County Party Secretary, who was carrying a telephone and a hoe to various townships to understand the situation and participate in labor. Ren Guodong said that both Hong'an and Jiyuan counties are mountainous areas with very bad natural conditions, but because leading cadres personally cultivated experimental fields, lived, ate, and labored with the farmers, and led the farmers to advance into nature, they finally changed the backwardness of the local area. He said that after this study, many County Party Secretaries who went with him were very enthusiastic and prepared to thoroughly change the leadership style of not being deep, not delving, and being divorced from the masses, and had the confidence to lead the masses to achieve the requirement of reaching 400 *jin*, 500 *jin*, and 800 *jin* per *mu* in advance.

　　Intellectuals Cannot Be Left Behind, Those Who Educate People Must First Educate Themselves Well

Many representatives from intellectual backgrounds emphasized the importance of further strengthening ideological transformation to be both red and expert in the future. They said that the workers, peasants, and working people have launched a Great Leap Forward in production and construction, and intellectuals cannot be left behind, they must also make a Great Leap Forward in thought. Che Xiangchen, an old educator and representative from Heilongjiang Province who is already in his sixties, criticized the erroneous view of some intellectuals that ideological transformation is almost complete. He said that further strengthening the ideological transformation of intellectuals is still an important issue at present. Especially those who are teachers, if they do not change their bourgeois standpoints and views, they will really mislead their students and harm people greatly. He emphasized that those who educate people must first educate themselves well. The Party must continue to strengthen the ideological transformation of intellectuals and systematically organize intellectuals to participate in labor practice, which is an important direction for the ideological transformation of intellectuals. Cao Yu, a writer and representative from Hubei Province, recently went to the countryside to live and work with farmers for a period of time. When talking about his experience during this period, he said that he was full of joy every day in the countryside. There, he discovered that farmers were by no means sitting and waiting for the coming of a happy socialist life, but were striving for it through the hard work of their entire families, day and night. He believes that it is "like a fish in water" for literary and art workers to go to rural factories and mines, while floating above is equivalent to "a fish in dried-up water." Cao Yu also mentioned that before a large number of cadres were sent to the countryside, some farmers once said that those knowledgeable city people are very useful to the country and the countryside. They have never done heavy work before, so they should be given some light work to do first when they first come, and let them exercise slowly, so as not to overwhelm their bodies. Cao Yu said with emotion that these words expressed the farmers' care for intellectuals. Facing such lovely, kind, and respectable working people, we intellectuals have no reason not to be determined to transform ourselves, learn from them wholeheartedly, and serve them.

　　Writer Ba Jin said that if literary and artistic work is separated from the leadership of the Party, and writers do not earnestly carry out ideological transformation, they will not only be unable to write any good works, but will also make major mistakes, and will not be able to profoundly reflect the new situation of the Great Leap Forward. At this meeting, the workers and peasants have already come up with many amazing achievements in their speeches. We are very excited on the one hand, and very anxious on the other hand. Compared with the creations of the workers and peasants, we are too backward. He emphasized that literary and artistic work is indeed a "dangerous profession." Writers are all individual laborers. For writers, it should be especially emphasized to go deep into the masses and earnestly transform their own thoughts.

　　Some scientific workers also discussed with an anxious mood how to further transform their thoughts and improve their awareness to "catch up" and better serve the Great Leap Forward in construction. Zhou Peiyuan, a representative from Jiangsu Province and Vice President of Peking University, said that the issue that scientific workers are most concerned about now is how to better serve the Great Leap Forward in construction and advance into nature together with the working people with a vigorous fighting will. He said that scientific research work can only play a guiding role if it is ahead of production. In order to complete the heavy scientific and technological research work well, we must strive to learn from the Soviet Union in the future, while combining with the masses, combining with production, and strengthening our own ideological transformation. Chen Fengtong, a representative from Henan Province and agricultural science researcher, asked to quickly reverse the situation that the thinking of agricultural science researchers lags behind the situation. He said that agricultural science research work is now lagging behind large-scale production. Therefore, we should also leap forward. Agricultural science research workers should participate in production and labor training well, and summarize the extremely rich production experience created by the masses well. If we can quickly reverse the situation of our backward thinking, we will be able to make research work catch up with the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture.

　　Do Not Compete for Fame and Status, But Launch a Great Competition of Contribution to the Country

Some representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors also talked about "catching up" ideologically and launching a great competition of contribution to the country in the industrial and commercial sectors. Liu Jingji, a representative from Shanghai and General Manager of Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture Anda Textile Factory, said that several representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai who participated in this conference have recently had a common feeling, that is, "the industrial and commercial sectors should also catch up." Our "catching up" is to strive to accelerate self-transformation, correct our stand, and contribute all our knowledge and skills to the country. Our industrial and commercial sectors should also launch a competition to see who transforms better and who contributes more. He said that when he participated in the rectification movement in Shanghai this time, he deeply felt that his own standpoint problem had not been resolved. In the future, he will earnestly participate in rectification and study, and also participate in labor practice in factories and agriculture, and contribute his technical knowledge with the enterprise as the base. He said: If some people in the industrial and commercial sectors "competed" for fame and status in the past, they should compete in the "contribution" of strength in the future to see who contributes more to the country.

　　Sun Xiaocun, a representative from Shandong Province and Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said at the group meeting that members of democratic parties, people from the industrial and commercial sectors, and bourgeois intellectuals must accelerate their self-transformation, otherwise there will be a gap in the overall Great Leap Forward of people from all walks of life in the country. He believes that most people in the bourgeoisie are still in an intermediate state, and many people do not have enough understanding of the reactionary nature of the Rightists. Some even think that the Rightists are "in trouble because of their words." In the future, "as long as you don't open your mouth, it's hard for even immortals to do anything." Many bourgeois intellectuals also have the idea of "clinging to the old." They said that although they would not be Rightists, they did not want to be Leftists either, but wanted to retain a little "free garden." He believes that these are great obstacles for the bourgeoisie and their intellectuals to carry out ideological transformation.

　　Minority Representatives are Determined to Transform Themselves and Promote the People in Their Regions to Take the Socialist Road

Some representatives of minority nationalities proposed in the discussion that they should be promoters, first transform themselves, and then promote the people in their regions to take the socialist road. Huang Zhengqing, Governor of Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, said that to take the socialist road, one must first transform oneself. Supporting socialism cannot be just verbal support, but must take practical actions. He said that he would take out his hundreds of horses, hundreds of sheep, and more than two hundred dairy cows for public-private joint ventures to promote the socialist cause in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.

　　Some representatives from minority areas also strictly criticized local nationalism. They said that these people, under the banner of "national interests" and "nationalization," were engaged in activities against the Communist Party, against socialism, and undermining national unity. Maimaiti Niyazi, a representative from Xinjiang, said that local nationalists want to lead our nation to the capitalist road, and are the enemies of our nation. Now the autonomous region is carrying out the struggle against local nationalism and conducting socialist education for people of all ethnic groups. We must firmly take the socialist road of common development and common prosperity with people of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Pu Zhao, Deputy Governor of Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, and Lei Chunguo, Deputy Governor of Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, believe in their speeches that the development and prosperity of minority nationalities can only be achieved by taking the socialist road and obtaining mutual assistance between all ethnic groups. Pu Zhao said that the saying that we should not take the road of cooperation and do not want the help of Han cadres has been opposed by people of all ethnic groups. Since the criticism of local nationalism began in December last year, the awareness of cadres of all ethnic groups has been raised, and people of all ethnic groups have actively demanded to take the socialist road in socialist education. He said that the four remote counties in their state will be able to establish more than 400 cooperatives this spring.

　　After several days of group discussions, the representatives expressed their belief that the Great Leap Forward in the thinking of people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life will definitely further promote the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. Our thinking must keep pace with the rapid changes in the motherland and quickly leap forward.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress continued its plenary discussion this afternoon. Many representatives expressed their determination to guide the "Oriental Dragon of 600 million people to ride the wind and waves, and advance further." Today's conference began at 3 pm, and a total of twenty-one representatives spoke and made written speeches at the conference.

　　"Striving forward to build our country into a strong socialist and modern country" and "Going all out and launching a Great Leap Forward in production and construction" have become the common language of all speakers. Huang Yanpei, an eighty-year-old representative, stepped onto the stage to challenge and compete with all the representatives; Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi said: Under the leadership of the Party, our nation has rejuvenated itself, and 600 million people have seen their bright and far-reaching future.

　　Contribute Technical Experience and the "Heart" Together

Huang Yanpei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, was the first to speak. He said that since he saw and heard about the current situation of the Great Leap Forward in all aspects of the country, he felt much younger, felt the warmth of spring in his heart, and felt a surge of energy in his whole body.

　　Huang Yanpei specifically talked about the transformation of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals. He believes that in taking the socialist road, bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals especially need to consciously and resolutely transform themselves. Bourgeois intellectuals must first solve the political stand issue of serving whom, overcome bourgeois ideas, learn from workers and peasants, and transform themselves into intellectuals of the working class. Although general industrialists and businessmen have handed over the means of production to the state, most people have not handed over their "hearts" to the state. Their bourgeois ideas will be exposed at any time. Only after fundamentally changing their political stand, contributing their technical and management experience together with their "hearts," can the people in industrial and commercial circles truly become the "wealth of the country."

　　Representatives who spoke on the issues of industrial and agricultural production and construction today included: Fu Zuoyi, Chen Shaokuan, Cai Yitian, Nie Guoqing, Li Neng, Liao Suhua, Qiu Jin, etc.

　　Four Months of Achievements Equal Half of Four Thousand Years

Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi focused on the current situation of farmland water conservancy construction in the country in his speech. He said that in the past eight years, the national water conservancy construction has achieved great success, but the scale and speed of this year's water conservancy movement is unprecedented. Before liberation, our ancestors opened up a total of 230 million *mu* of irrigation area in four thousand years, but in the four months from last winter to the end of January this year, we opened up more than 117 million *mu*, which is equal to half of the total irrigation area opened up in the past four thousand years. If you are not on the scene, you really dare not imagine it.

　　Fu Zuoyi pointed out that the most fundamental reason why the awakened people can do miracles that no one has ever dared to imagine is the wise and strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Under the leadership of the Party, 600 million people have seen a more distant and brighter future for themselves. This is the source of our strength to overcome difficulties and create miracles.

　　Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Governor of Fujian Province, said in his speech that the people of Fujian Province are actively exploring the resources of the province with full confidence, vigorously supporting agriculture, and striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture. He believes that it is entirely possible for Fujian Province to enable the vast majority of cooperatives to catch up with or exceed the production level of local wealthy middle peasants in two or three years.

　　Cai Yitian, an agricultural labor model from Hubei, vividly introduced the situation of changing dry land into paddy fields in Fuwan Township, Gucheng County, where he is located in his written speech. He said that their area is a half-mountain and half-plain area, with insufficient water volume. Whenever it comes to pulling wheat and transplanting rice seedlings, the water channels become exhausted. There is a abundant Nan River in this township, and the masses have long wanted to build a large canal to use its water to irrigate farmland, but this desire has never been realized. For a long time, they can only watch the torrential river flowing eastward, sighing and saying: "Nan River water cannot save the fields!" However, in this Great Leap Forward of water conservancy construction, they overcame various difficulties, opened a canal on the hillside, and opened up the cliff. A 20-*li*-long canal was finally built, and the long-cherished wish of the farmers was finally realized. Cai Yitian said that now everyone in their cooperative has high confidence and has already formulated a ten-year long-term plan for agricultural development, striving to increase grain production by more than one time this year, and cotton by three times.

　　Nie Guoqing, Deputy Governor of Hubei Province, said that cotton in Hubei has always had low yields and poor quality, and some people have doubted whether Hubei is suitable for growing cotton. However, since the cooperativization, Hubei's cotton production has shown a leap forward trend. In 1957, the total cotton output of the province reached 4.3 million dan, an increase of 10.62% over 1956 and an increase of 62% over 1952. The two counties with the highest output, Macheng and Guangji, had an average *mu* yield of 100 *jin* of ginned cotton. Nie Guoqing said that this year, Hubei Province's total cotton output is planned to reach 5 million dan. As long as we strengthen leadership, go all out, and fully mobilize the masses, we are fully confident of completing this task.

　　Li Neng, an agricultural labor model from Yunnan, said that their cooperative is now launching a socialist production competition with brother cooperatives in the county and province. Their main increase targets are: the unit area yield of grain should reach the 800 *jin* requirement stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program this year, the total output should increase by 56% compared with last year, and the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries should increase by more than one time.

　　Liao Suhua, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee Supervision Commission of the Chinese Communist Party, introduced the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industrial production in Chongqing.

　　Qiu Jin, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the China Seamen's Union, said in a written speech that all water transport workers will show the indomitable working class spirit and do everything possible to make the water transport industry fully adapt to the needs of the new leap forward in national economic development.

　　Language Reform Will Create Conditions for a Cultural Upsurge

Ye Shengtao, Hu Yuzhi, Luo Changpei, and Wei Que jointly reported to the conference on the situation of the recent report meetings and symposiums on language reform held by six working groups dispatched by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to more than a dozen cities across the country. These four representatives are all heads of the aforementioned working groups. Today, Ye Shengtao spoke on their behalf at the meeting. They talked about how people from all walks of life in various cities support the policy and current tasks of language reform, agree with the "Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme," and believe that the realization of the task of language reform will create conditions for the arrival of a socialist cultural upsurge. They suggested that this conference approve the "Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" and said that the implementation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme will enable the new generation and the working people to master the language of the motherland more quickly, will accelerate the promotion of Mandarin, promote the further development of the national common language, and create various convenient conditions for the use of characters and symbols. They hoped that everyone would be a promoter of language reform, fully implement the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, and strive to complete the current task of language reform.

　　Zhou Gucheng, a professor at Fudan University, called in his speech for the higher education sector to vigorously help promote the phonetic alphabet scheme to promote the unification of language and accelerate the work of eradicating illiteracy among the broad masses of working people, so that they can better and faster absorb scientific and technological knowledge and enjoy cultural life.

　　Gao Shiqi, a consultant to the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, talked in a written speech about how the members of the Association for Science and Technology Popularization have grown to 320,000, forming a powerful army for the promotion of science and technology. He called on science and technology workers across the country to assist relevant departments in summarizing, improving, and promoting the farmers' high-yield experience, publicizing agricultural science and technology knowledge and health knowledge to the broad masses of farmers, helping farmers to better advance towards technology, launch a tenacious struggle against natural disasters and diseases, and better serve the promotion of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

　　A New Atmosphere of Combining Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Appears in Qinghai

In their speeches, Xi Raojiacuo, Deputy Governor of Qinghai Province, Songbu, Deputy Director of the National Affairs Commission of Qinghai Province, and Xia Ronggabu, Governor of Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province, all pointed out that Qinghai Province, which has always been known for its vast land and sparse population, has made great progress in industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry production in recent years, and the material and cultural lives of people of all ethnic groups have been significantly improved.

　　Xi Raojiacuo (Tibetan) said that in 1958, Qinghai Province will increase grain production by 280 million *jin* on the basis of 1.28 billion *jin* in 1957, accounting for 21.87% of the original output; the planned number of livestock in the province will reach 18,552,000 heads (pieces), an increase of 8% compared with the estimated figure in 1957. Industrial output and basic construction investment have increased compared with last year.

　　Xia Ronggabu (Tibetan) introduced in a written speech the superiority of animal husbandry cooperation shown in the pilot operation of animal husbandry cooperatives and public-private joint venture ranches in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province, which is: significantly increasing production and increasing the income of cooperative members. The net income of the five animal husbandry societies in Sujitan in this state increased by 50% in 1957 compared with 1956. In addition to settling down in recent years, a new atmosphere of combining agriculture and animal husbandry has been formed. The grain harvested by the Second Branch of the Sujitan Animal Husbandry Society in 1957 can be used by all members of the society for half a year, and the planted fodder can basically meet the needs. He said that these facts point out the correct direction for the people in the animal husbandry areas. We must show revolutionary vigor to promote the upsurge in animal husbandry production.

　　Songbu (Tu ethnic group) reported in a written speech the rich resources and construction situation he learned from inspecting the Qaidam Basin.

　　He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, focused on the current guidelines and policies of China's overseas Chinese affairs work in a written speech.

　　Chen Jiageng and Li Zonglin, Mayor of Chengdu, and Liu Guojun, Deputy Governor of Jiangsu Province, also spoke and made written speeches at the conference today. Chen Jiageng talked about the issue of opposing localism in his speech; Li Zonglin introduced the situation of cadres being sent to lower levels in Chengdu; Liu Guojun expressed his views on the ideological transformation of industrialists and businessmen.

　　The executive chairmen of today's conference were: Shen Junru, Lai Ruoyu, Su Yu, Xu Teli, Xiong Kewu, Hu Helete, Sheng Pihua, Lin Qiaozhi, Chen Yuan, and Rao Xingli.

　　Today's conference ended at 7:15 pm. The conference will continue tomorrow.

### 政治思想工作是一切工作的统帅  建设大跃进必须思想大跃进  人民代表在小组和大会讨论中谈论精神世界的改造

　　政治思想工作是一切工作的统帅
    建设大跃进必须思想大跃进
    人民代表在小组和大会讨论中谈论精神世界的改造
    新华社6日讯　在社会主义建设大跃进中，还必须一鼓作气同时来一个思想大跃进。这是全国人民代表大会代表在这几天来的小组讨论和同记者的接触中强调指出的一个头等重要的问题。代表们今天上午继续分组举行会议。他们指出，整风和反右派斗争带来了生产建设的大跃进，使人们的思想和精神面貌大改观；但是，政治是统帅，是灵魂，为了适应建设大跃进的新形势，必须进一步加强共产党的领导，加强政治思想工作，加强思想的改造，使人们来一个思想大跃进。
    叙永县把右派分子带上大山  让他们看看社会主义的浪潮
    在整风运动中，右派分子曾猖狂地攻击共产党的领导，攻击社会主义事业，现在社会主义事业的大发展，有力地回击了右派分子的谰言。四川省叙永县副县长罗文才用生动的事例，说明了党和群众相结合以后所产生的伟大作用。他谈到这个县在去年整风时，右派分子从各方面对党的领导进行了污蔑，他们要求取消党的县委会，说县委领导农民生产是骗人的事情，他们到处散布悲观失望的情绪。但是广大劳动人民信任党的英明领导，在大争大辩以后，全县人民决定大力增产粮食，向荒山进军。这个县的中共县委会坚决转变了作风，克服了右倾保守思想，拟出了征服荒山的计划。县委书记和县长以及区委书记们，先后两次亲自率领上万农民、县城居民和机关干部，向着虎狼豺豹横行、云雾弥漫的荒山进军。他们提出的口号是：“不怕冷，不怕饿，要叫大荒山向我们认错”。经过两个月的奋斗，全面改造了两座四周有六七十里长、八百多公尺高的大山，开垦出了大批荒地，其中一个大山，今年就可以增产十六万斤粮食。这个生动的事实，给了右派分子以最有力的回击。这个县在最后曾特地把右派分子们带到了大山上，叫他们看看人民群众的力量，看看社会主义的浪潮，看看党的领导的伟大作用。罗文才说，今年，县委会还计划再征服五座大山，全县增产粮食两千万斤。
    打掉官气，深入田间，背着电话机  扛着锄头，进行生动的领导
    代表们肯定地认为，在整风和反右派之后，显著的变化是各级领导干部思想作风的转变。现在，各地都在打掉官气，反对三个坏主义，摆着官僚架子，在群众面前指手划脚的人少起来了，那些过去曾经被农民嘲笑是“大少爷”的领导干部，今天也开始改变了。湖北省代表、湖北省省长张体学强调地指出，这是一个重大的改变。他说，在湖北省的专区、县、区各级干部中，搞试验田钻下去具体领导生产的作风，已开始在全省形成风气，农民表示热烈欢迎。有的县和区的所有干部，在冬季大生产高潮中，每天早饭以前都要去帮助农民向地里送一担到两担粪，这种随时随地帮助农民生产的做法，在不少地区形成了经常的制度。张体学说，在整风以前，干部中联系群众和艰苦奋斗的作风曾经一度减弱，讲吃讲穿的风气有些抬头，农村中的政治思想工作也有些放松。整风和反右派斗争所取得的成果，充分地证明了政治思想工作是一切工作的统帅。今后必须警惕骄傲自满和保守思想的抬头，继续加强党的领导，坚持开展一年一度的整风运动，使全体干部和人民永远保持蓬勃的朝气。
    为了适应生产大跃进的新形势，彻底转变作风，有的地方组织干部到先进地区去参观学习。黑龙江省代表、中共牡丹江地委书记任国栋，不久前曾带领一些干部亲自到湖北省红安县、河南省济源县去观摩学习。根据学习的体会，他认为加强政治思想工作，打掉官气，转变领导方法，是保证农业生产跃进再跃进的决定性环节。他说，他到济源县，看到这个县的女副县长同农民一起在石头山上开渠道，夜里就同农民一起住在山上。在红安县，他们找了三天才把县委书记找到，原来县委书记背着电话机、扛着锄头，去各乡了解情况和参加劳动去了。任国栋说，红安、济源两县都是山区，自然条件很坏，但是由于领导干部亲自种试验田，和农民同吃同住同劳动，深入领导农民向大自然进军，终于改变了当地的落后面貌。他说，经过这次学习，同去的许多县委书记劲头很大，准备彻底转变不深不钻、脱离群众的领导作风，并且有信心带领群众提前实现每亩产量达到四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的要求。
　　知识分子不能掉队  教育人的人首先要教育好自己
    许多知识分子出身的代表，强调地谈到今后加强思想改造做到又红又专的重要意义。他们说，工农劳动人民掀起了生产建设的大跃进，知识分子不能掉队，也必须来一个思想大跃进。年已花甲的老教育家、黑龙江省代表车向忱批评了有些知识分子认为思想改造已经差不多了的错误看法。他说，知识分子进一步加强思想改造，仍然是当前一个重要问题。尤其做教师的不改变资产阶级立场、观点，实在误人子弟，害人不浅。他强调教育人的人首先必须教育好自己，党要继续加强对知识分子的思想改造，有计划地组织知识分子参加劳动实践，而这是知识分子思想改造的一个重要方向。湖北省代表、作家曹禺最近刚到农村中同农民们共同生活、共同劳动了一个时间，他在谈到自己这一段生活的体会时说，他在农村里每天都充满了快乐，在那里，他发现农民们决不是坐着等待社会主义幸福生活的来临，而是以全家大小、夜以继日的艰苦劳动来争取它。他认为文艺工作者下放农村厂矿是“如鱼得水”，而漂浮在上面等于“枯水之鱼”。曹禺还谈到，在大批干部没有下放农村之前，有些农民曾经这样说，那些有知识的城里人，对国家对农村都大有用处，他们从来没有干过重活，刚来时要先给些轻活干，让他们慢慢锻炼，不要累垮他们的身体。曹禺感慨地说，这些话表达了农民对知识分子的关怀，面对着这样可爱、可亲、可敬的劳动人民，我们知识分子没有任何理由不下决心改造自己，全心全意地向他们学习，为他们服务。
    作家巴金说，文艺工作如果离开了党的领导，作家不认真进行思想改造，不仅写不出什么好的作品，而且要犯大错误，更不能深刻地反映出大跃进的新形势。在这次会议上，工农群众在发言中已经拿出了很多惊人的成绩，我们听了一面兴奋得很，一面又着急得很，比起工农群众的创造，我们是太落后了。他强调说，文艺工作确实是一个“危险的职业”，作家都是个体劳动，对作家来说，应该特别强调深入到群众中去，认真地改造自己的思想。
    一些科学工作者也以一种焦急的心情探讨怎样进一步改造思想提高觉悟“赶上去”，更好地为建设大跃进服务。江苏省代表、北京大学副校长周培源说，科学工作者现在最关心的问题，是如何更好地为建设大跃进服务，以旺盛的战斗意志同劳动人民一起向大自然进军。他说，科学研究工作只有走在生产前面才能起指导作用。为了很好地完成繁重的科学技术研究工作，我们必须在今后一方面努力向苏联学习，同时和群众结合，和生产结合，加强自己的思想改造。河南省代表、农业科学研究工作者陈凤桐要求迅速扭转农业科学研究人员思想落后于形势的状况，他说，现在农业科学研究工作落在大生产的后面，因此，我们也应该跃进。农业科学研究工作人员应该很好地参加生产和劳动锻炼，很好地总结群众创造的极为丰富的生产经验，如果能够迅速扭转我们思想落后的状况，就能够使研究工作赶上农业大跃进的新形势。
　　不要在名誉地位上竞赛  要掀起一个对国家贡献的大竞赛
    一些工商界的代表，也纷纷谈论着要在思想上“赶上去”，要在工商界掀起一个对国家贡献的大竞赛。上海市代表、上海公私合营安达纺织厂总经理刘靖基说，我们上海市参加这次大会的几个工商界的代表，最近都有一个共同的感觉，就是“工商界也应该赶上去”，我们的“赶上去”就是要努力加速自我改造，端正自己的立场，把一切知识技能贡献给国家，我们工商界也应该掀起一个看谁改造得好、看谁贡献得多的竞赛。他说，我这次在上海参加整风运动，深深感觉到自己的立场问题并没有解决。今后要认真地参加整风学习，同时还要参加工厂和农业的劳动实践，并且以企业为基地，贡献自己的技术知识。他说：如果过去工商界有些人在名誉地位上“竞赛”的话，今后就要在“贡献”力量方面竞赛，看谁对国家贡献的多。
　　山东省代表、中国民主建国会中央常委孙晓村在小组会上说，民主党派成员、工商界人士以及资产阶级知识分子必须加速进行自我改造，否则在全国各阶层人民的全面大跃进中就有了一个缺口。他认为，资产阶级中多数人还处于中间状态，不少人对右派分子的反动性还认识不够，有的还认为右派分子是“祸从口出”，今后“只要不开口、神仙难下手”；在资产阶级知识分子中也有不少人存在着“抱残守缺”的思想，他们表示虽然不去当右派，但也不想当左派，而是想保留一点“自由园地”。他认为这些都是资产阶级和它们的知识分子进行思想改造的极大障碍。
　　少数民族代表决心改造自己  推动本地区人民走社会主义道路
    一些少数民族代表在讨论中，提出要当促进派，要首先改造自己，来推动本地区人民走社会主义道路。甘肃省甘南藏族自治州州长黄正清说，要走社会主义道路首先要改造自己，拥护社会主义不能只是口头上拥护，要拿出实际行动来。他表示回去要把自己的几百匹马、几百只羊和二百多头奶牛拿出来实行公私合营，促进甘南藏族自治州的社会主义事业。
    有些少数民族地区的代表还严格地批判了地方民族主义，他们说，这些人打着“民族利益”、“民族化”的旗帜，进行反对共产党、反社会主义和破坏民族团结的活动。新疆代表马木提·尼亚孜说，地方民族主义者想把我们民族引向到资本主义道路上去，是我们民族的敌人。现在自治区正在进行反地方民族主义的斗争、向各族人民进行社会主义教育，我们要坚定地在中国共产党的领导下，同各族人民一道走共同发展、共同繁荣的社会主义道路。云南省红河哈尼族彝族自治州副州长普照和德宏傣族景颇族自治州副州长雷春国在发言中认为，少数民族的发展和繁荣，只有走社会主义的道路，和取得各民族间的互相帮助才成。普照说，那种不走合作化道路和不要汉族干部帮助的说法，已受到各族人民的反对。从去年12月开始批判地方民族主义以来，各族干部的觉悟提高了，各族人民在社会主义教育中，积极要求走社会主义道路。他说他们州里边远的四个县，今春就可以建立四百多个合作社。
    经过几天来的小组讨论，代表们表示相信：各族各界人民思想的大跃进，肯定地将进一步推动社会主义建设事业的大跃进，我们的思想必须随着祖国面貌日新月异的变化，迅速地跟着跃进。
    据新华社6日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议今天下午继续进行大会讨论。许多代表在发言时意志昂扬，决心引导“六亿人民的东方巨龙乘风破浪，前进再前进”。今天的大会在下午三时开始，在大会上发言和书面发言的代表共有二十一人。
    “奋发向前，把我国建成一个社会主义现代化强国”、“鼓足干劲，掀起生产建设的大跃进”，已经成了所有发言者的共同语言。年已八旬的黄炎培代表登台挑战，要同全体代表比干劲；水利部长傅作义说：我们的民族在党的领导下返老还童，六亿人民已经看清了自己的灿烂远大的前程。
　　把技术经验和“心”一齐贡献出来
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长黄炎培第一个发言。他说，自从他看到和听到了目前国家在各方面的大跃进的情况后，就好像年轻了许多，心头上感到了春天的温暖，全身也出现了一股干劲。
    黄炎培特别谈到了资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的改造问题。他认为在走社会主义的道路中，资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子，特别需要自觉地坚决改造自己。资产阶级知识分子必须首先解决为谁服务的政治立场问题，克服资产阶级思想，向工农群众学习，把自己变成为工人阶级的知识分子。一般工商业者虽然已把生产资料交给了国家，但大多数人的“心”并没有交给国家。他们的资产阶级思想会随时暴露出来，工商界人士只有从根本上改变自己的政治立场以后，把技术和经营管理的经验连同自己的“心”一齐贡献出来，才可以真正成为“国家的财富”。
    今天就工农业生产建设问题发言的代表有：傅作义、陈绍宽、蔡以田、聂国青、李能、廖苏华、丘金等。
　　四个月的成绩等于四千年的一半
    水利部长傅作义代表在发言中着重谈到了当前全国农田水利建设进行的情况。他说，八年来，全国水利建设获得了很大的成就，但是像今年水利运动这样的规模和速度，却是空前的。解放前，我们的祖先在四千年里一共开辟了两亿三千万亩的灌溉面积，可是在去冬到今年1月底的四个月里，我们就开辟了一亿一千七百多万亩，等于过去四千年开辟的总灌溉面积的一半。若非身临其境，真是不敢想像。
    傅作义指出，觉醒了的人民所以能够干出前无古人谁也不敢想像的奇迹来，最根本的原因是中国共产党英明坚强的领导。在党的领导下，六亿人民看见了自己更远大更灿烂的未来，这是我们战胜困难创造奇迹的力量的源泉。
    福建省副省长陈绍宽代表在发言中说，福建全省人民正在信心百倍地积极发掘省内资源，大力支援农业，争取农业大丰收。他认为福建省在二、三年内使绝大多数合作社赶上或超过当地富裕中农的生产水平，是完全可以做到的。
    来自湖北的农业劳动模范蔡以田代表，在书面发言中生动地介绍了他所在的谷城县傅湾乡改旱田为水田的情况。他说他们那里是个半山半平原地区，水量不足，每到拔麦插秧时，水渠发生枯竭现象。这个乡有一条水量充沛的南河，群众很早就想修一条大渠，利用它的水来灌溉农田，可是这一愿望从未实现，长期以来他们只能望着那滔滔的河水向东流去，叹息着说：“南河水救不了田！”可是，在这次水利建设大跃进中，克服了种种困难，在山腰开渠、把悬崖打通，一条二十里长的大渠终于修好，农民的宿愿终于实现了。蔡以田说，现在他们的合作社大家信心很高，已经订出了农业发展的十年远景规划，争取今年粮食要增加一番以上，棉花增加三番。
    湖北省副省长聂国青代表说，湖北的棉花过去一直是产量低、品质差，曾有人怀疑：湖北是否适宜种棉花。可是从合作化以来，湖北的棉花生产却出现了跃进的形势，1957年全省棉花总产量达到了四百三十万担，比1956年增产10.62％，比1952年增产62％。产量最高的麻城、广济两个县，全县平均亩产皮棉达到一百斤。聂国青说，今年湖北省的棉花总产量计划达到五百万担，只要加强领导，鼓足干劲，充分发动群众，完成这一任务是完全有把握的。
    来自云南的农业劳动模范李能代表说，他们合作社现在正在同全县、全省兄弟社展开社会主义生产大竞赛，他们的主要增产指标是：粮食的单位面积产量今年要达到农业发展纲要规定的八百斤的要求，总产量比去年增加五成六，农副业总产值要增长一倍以上。
    中共重庆市委监察委员会书记廖苏华代表介绍了重庆市工业生产大跃进的情况。
    中国海员工会全国委员会副主席丘金在书面发言中表示，全体水运职工将拿出顽强不屈的工人阶级干劲，千方百计地使水运事业充分适应国民经济发展新跃进的需要。
　　文字改革将为文化高潮创造条件
    叶圣陶、胡愈之、罗常培、韦悫的联合发言，向大会报告了最近政协全国委员会派出六个工作组到全国十多个城市举行有关文字改革的报告会和座谈会的情况。这四位代表都是上述工作组的负责人，今天由叶圣陶代表他们在会上发言。他们谈到了各城市的各界人士都拥护文字改革的方针和当前的任务，赞同“汉语拼音方案草案”，认为文字改革任务的实现将为社会主义文化高潮的到来创造条件。他们建议这次大会批准“汉语拼音方案草案”，并且说，汉语拼音方案的推行将使新的一代和劳动人民更快地掌握祖国的文字，将加速普通话的推广，促进民族共同语的进一步的发展，创造使用文字和符号的种种便利条件。他们希望大家都来做文字改革的促进派，全力推行汉语拼音方案，为完成当前文字改革任务而奋斗。
    复旦大学教授周谷城代表在发言中要求高教界大力帮助拼音方案的推行，以促进语言的统一，并且在广大劳动人民中加快扫盲工作，使他们能够更好更快地吸收科学技术知识和享受文化生活。
    中华全国科学技术普及协会顾问高士其代表在书面发言中，谈到了科学技术普及协会的会员已发展到三十二万人，形成了一支强大的科学技术宣传大军。他号召全国科学技术工作者要协助有关部门总结、提高和推广农民的丰产经验，向广大农民宣传农业科学技术知识和卫生知识，帮助农民更好地向技术进军，向自然灾害和疾病展开顽强的斗争，更好地为促进农业生产的大跃进服务。
　　青海出现农牧业结合的新气象
    青海省副省长喜饶嘉错、青海省民族事务委员会副主任松布、青海省海北藏族自治州州长夏茸尕布等三位代表的发言中，都指出素称地广人稀的青海省，几年来工、农、牧业生产已有很大发展，各族人民的物质和文化生活已有显著的提高和改善。
    喜饶嘉错代表（藏族）说，青海省在1958年，粮食将在1957年十二亿八千万斤的基础上，增产二亿八千万斤，为原有产量的21.87％；全省各种牲畜头数，计划将达到一千八百五十五万二千头（匹），比1957年预计增长8％。工业产量和基本建设投资都比去年有增长。
    夏茸尕布代表（藏族）在书面发言中介绍了青海省海北藏族自治州试办牧业合作社和公私合营牧场中所显示的牧业合作化的优越性，这就是：显著地增加了生产、增加了社员收入。这个州苏吉滩的五个牧业社，1957年的纯收入比1956年增加了50％。加上几年来的定居，农牧业结合的新气象已经形成，苏吉滩牧业社二分社1957年收获的粮食，可供全社社员半年之用，种植的饲草基本上可以满足需要。他说，这些事实，向牧业区人民指出了正确方向，我们要拿出革命干劲，来促进牧业生产高潮。
    松布代表（土族）在书面发言中，报告了他视察柴达木盆地所了解的丰富资源和建设情况。
    华侨事务委员会主任何香凝代表在书面发言中着重谈到了当前我国侨务工作的方针政策。
    今天在大会上发言和书面发言的还有陈嘉庚代表和成都市长李宗林、江苏省副省长刘国钧。陈嘉庚代表在发言中谈到了反对地方主义的问题；李宗林代表介绍了成都市下放干部的情况；刘国钧代表就工商业者的思想改造问题发表了意见。
