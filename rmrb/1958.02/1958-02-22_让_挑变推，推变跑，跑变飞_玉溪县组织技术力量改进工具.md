To let "Picking turn into Pushing, Pushing turn into Running, Running turn into Flying"
Yuxi County Organizes Technical Forces to Improve Tools

This newspaper reports that in the water conservancy construction movement in Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, in order to improve work efficiency and speed up progress, the slogans of "Picking turn into Pushing, Pushing turn into Running, Running turn into Flying", "Every township has a factory, every commune has animal-drawn carts, and every household has a pushcart," and "Eliminate heavy manual labor of carrying things on people's shoulders and backs" were put forward. Since then, a wave of tool improvement has swept across all construction sites in the county. Up to now, the county has promoted advanced tools such as man-powered carts, single and double three-wheeled water carts, earth baskets, flying baskets, wooden and stone sheep horn rollers, pulley rammers, stone and iron flying crushers, moon-bow stone hammers, explosive blasting, etc., totaling twenty-one categories and more than thirty types. These tools generally improve work efficiency by at least 50%, and up to more than twenty-five times. For example, one person pushing a cart can achieve the efficiency of twelve people carrying loads. In the past, stones lifted by eight people can now be pushed by just one person. The newly invented mine cars and earth baskets increase work efficiency by more than twenty-five times.

In the process of creating and improving new tools, the masses' enthusiasm is extremely high.

In order to push the improvement of tools and the increase of work efficiency to a high tide of technological reform, tool reform committees have been established in all districts, townships, and communes of Yuxi County to specifically lead this work. At the same time, they have also organized more than eight hundred carpenters, with these carpenters as the core, to form a huge technical team. They proposed "construction sites as schools, and engineering projects as teaching materials," vigorously training apprentices, and preparing to push the tool improvement movement in all aspects.

    让“挑变推，推变跑，跑变飞”
    玉溪县组织技术力量改进工具
    本报讯　云南省玉溪县在兴修水利运动中，为了提高工效，加快进度，曾提出“挑变推，推变跑，跑变飞”，“乡乡有工厂，社社有牛马车，户户有推车”，
  “消灭人挑人背的笨重劳动”的号召以来，改良工具的热潮，普及全县大小工地。到目前止，全县已经推广的先进工具有人推地车，单、双三轮水推车，地兜，飞兜，木、石羊角碾，滑轮夯压，石铁飞硪，月弓敲石，炸药炸土等等二十一类三十多种。这些工具一般提高工效至少在50％，多到二十五倍以上。如人推地车一天一人能抵十二个人挑的效率，过去八个人抬的石头，现在只要一个人推也就可以了。新发明的矿车、地兜提高工效二十五倍以上。
    在创造和改良新式工具的过程中，群众情绪极为高涨。
    为了把改进工具，提高工效推向技术改革的高潮，玉溪县各区乡乡社社都成立了工具改革委员会，具体领导这一工作。同时，他们还把八百多个木工组织起来了，以这些木工为核心，组成了一支庞大的技术队伍，提出以“工地为学校，工程为教材”，大力的培养学徒工，准备把改良工具的运动，推向各个方面。
