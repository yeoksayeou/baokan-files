Sending Military Officers' Families Back to Their Hometowns
　　Xie Juezai

    The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's directive "Concerning Mobilizing Military Officers' Families to Return to Their Hometowns for Production and Participation in Socialist Construction" states: "The army is the armed force of the country and a combat organization. In principle, the families of all members should not reside with the army." Therefore, both mobilizing military families to return to their hometowns and military officers' families voluntarily returning to their hometowns are appropriate and correct.

    Zhao Zilong fought bravely at Changban Slope for the sake of Liu Xuande carrying Madam Gan, Madam Mi, and A Dou. Liu Xuande said, "For you, this child, I almost lost a great general." Leaving aside the "saving the lord," if war actions are hindered or combat strength is lost because of family members, it is not worthwhile. According to historical records, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao Yun were not married at the time; Zhuge Liang was married, but his Madam Huang did not accompany the army, but remained at Wolong Gang. When Cao Cao sent people to search for her, she had anticipated this and moved elsewhere.

    Throughout the history of warfare, there are no records of family members accompanying the army. In the decades of the People's Liberation Army's southern and northern battles, there were only female combatants, female political workers, and medical personnel, but no family members accompanying the army.

    Not long ago, some young military personnel asked me to speak, and I said: "The vast majority of you are unmarried. The ancients said: 'A man marries at thirty.' Article 35 of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China also stipulates that the maximum age for a lieutenant in active service is thirty to thirty-five. Therefore, marrying at thirty not only suits the circumstances of the army but also conforms to ancient etiquette. I suggest you best get married when you are thirty. If you want to marry earlier, then I suggest you find someone in your hometown and have a 'leave for marriage'. Taking leave for marriage was considered a great honor in the past (Note). I don't approve of you having family burdens now. 'Raising soldiers for a thousand days is for use in a single moment.' When it's time to go, you go; when it's time to fight, you fight. How can you be distracted by family matters?"

    The People's Daily editorial said: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the armed force that defends our country's socialist construction and defends against imperialist aggression. It is undergoing modernization. A large number of military officers' families residing with the army seriously affects the army's construction, defense, and training. For military officers, family members residing with the army inevitably disperses their energy. From the family's clothing, food, housing, and transportation to the upbringing and education of children, the military officer must take care of it. This inevitably affects the completion of the military officer's tasks of training soldiers and studying." The people's officers fully understand this principle. The military officers' families also fully understand this principle. Therefore, unmarried military officers postpone their marriage age slightly, and married military officers send their families back to their hometowns. This is an important matter in army building.

    Many military officers' families have a certain labor force and considerable cultural and technical skills. Accompanying the army may not be useful; they are just consumers, and they inevitably feel depressed. Returning to their hometowns is like fish returning to water and birds entering the forest, and they can make many achievements in production and work. Men become heroes on the front lines, and women become models in the rear. Everyone can become a model, but there must be a garden to cultivate them, and that is the "rear".

    Tens of millions of military families have already returned to their hometowns, and tens of millions more are preparing to return to their hometowns.

    A poem says: One man at the front, one woman at the rear, both diligent and brave, each matching. Rural production needs labor, you build the army, and I build the countryside.

　　Two

　　Hearing of returning home, the heart already flies, what to add to the luggage?
　　Seeking new varieties of vegetables and fruits, also buy a pair of Leghorn chickens.

　　Three

　　The old mother takes her grandson on the train, sitting and watching the clouds and trees, a smiling face.
　　I knew long ago that my hometown is not what it used to be, with new houses, new clothes, and granaries full of grain.

　　Four

　　Next year, I plan to meet the Cowherd, taking leave to return home with joy.
　　The mother is leaning against the door diligently mending socks, and the child has just been dismissed from school and is learning to transplant rice seedlings.

　　Five

    Focus and determination, a towering spirit, the navy, army, and air force practice a lot.
    Men are heroes, women are models, the human world originally needs a Milky Way.

    (Note) In the past, scholars said: "To have the wedding night in the bridal chamber, one must be named on the gold list." After being appointed to the Hanlin Academy, requesting leave to return home for marriage was very glorious. After they returned home for marriage, they were not necessarily able to bring their wives out.

### 送军官家属还乡
谢觉哉

　　送军官家属还乡
　　谢觉哉
    中国人民解放军总政治部“关于动员军官家属还乡生产、参加社会主义建设”的指示中说：“军队是国家的武装力量，是一个战斗组织，一切成员的家属原则上都不能随军居住。”那末，动员军属还乡与军官家属自动还乡，都是应该的、正确的。
    赵子龙大战长坂坡，为的是刘玄德带着甘、糜二夫人和阿斗；刘玄德说：“为汝这孺子，几损我一员大将。”抛开“救主”不说，如果因为家属的原故，使战争行动受到阻挠，战斗力量受到损失，那是很不值得的事。据传书上载：关羽、张飞、赵云当时都没有结婚；诸葛亮是结了婚的，但他那位黄夫人没有随军，仍住在卧龙岗。曹操派人去搜捕，她早已料到此着，搬往别处去了。
    从古到今的战争史，看不到有随军家属的记载。人民解放军几十年南征北战，也只有女战斗员、女政治工作人员和医务人员，而没有随军家属。
    不久前，有一些青年军人要我讲话，我说：“你们绝大多数人是未结婚的。古人说：‘男子三十而娶’。中华人民共和国兵役法第三十五条也规定尉官服现役的最高年龄为三十岁至三十五岁。那末，到三十岁娶妻，不只是合乎军队的情况，而且也合乎古礼。我建议你们最好到三十岁才结婚。如若要早点结婚，那就建议你们在家乡找个对象，来一个‘请假归娶’。请假归娶，以前的人认为是顶荣幸的。（注）我不赞成你们现在就有家累，‘养兵千日，用在一时’，说走就走，说打就打，那容得你分心家事。”
    人民日报社论说：“中国人民解放军是保卫我国进行社会主义建设和防御帝国主义侵略的武装力量，它正在进行现代化的建设。大批军官家属随军居住，严重影响部队的建设、守备和训练。对于军官来说，家属随军居住，势必使军官精力分散，从家属的衣食住行到子女的抚育和教养，都须要军官分心照顾。这就必然影响军官训练士兵和学习进修的任务的完成。”人民的军官完全了解这道理。军官家属也完全了解这道理。所以未结婚的军官，把婚龄略为推迟，已结婚的军官送家属还乡，这是建军的一件重要事情。
    军官家属很多具有一定的劳动力和相当的文化技术，随军呢，不见得有用，只是一个消费者，自己也不免苦闷。还乡呢，那就像鱼得了水、鸟入了林，能做出很多生产、工作上的事业。男的前方当英雄，女的后方当模范；模范人人可以当，但要有培养她的园地，那就是“后方”。
    已经有成千万的随军军属还乡了，还有成千万的随军军属正准备还乡。
    诗曰：一男在前方女后方，勤劳勇敢各相当。农村生产需劳力，你建军来我建乡。
　　二
　　一说还乡心已飞，行囊添点甚东西。
　　访寻蔬果新品种，还要买对来亨鸡。
　　三
　　老母携孙上火车，坐看云树笑颜开。
　　早知故里今非昔，新屋新衣谷满堆。
　　四
　　明年预计接牛郎，请假归来喜气洋。
　　母正倚门勤补袜，儿才放学学栽秧。
　　五
    专心致志气巍峨，海陆空军练习多。
    男是英雄女模范，人间原要有天河。
    （注）以前念书人说：“要得洞房花烛夜，必须金榜挂名时”。点了翰林，上书乞假归娶，是很光荣的事。他们归娶后也并不就能把夫人带出。
