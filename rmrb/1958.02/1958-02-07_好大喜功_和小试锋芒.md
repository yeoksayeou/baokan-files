"One was kept busy appreciating it all" was once used to describe the scenery on the Shanyin Road. I have never been to eastern Zhejiang and have not personally experienced that wonderful realm. However, newspapers in recent times have indeed displayed the infinitely beautiful scenery of the high tide of the socialist leap forward across the country.

Look! This year, we will produce 6.24 million tons of steel and over 150 million tons of coal; Gansu Province is determined to work hard for three years to change the face of the entire province; Fujian is striving to become a "thousand-catty province" within five years; Jiangsu Province will become a "four-without" province within four years; three rubber factories in Shanghai guarantee to catch up with the level of British Dunlop tires in four or five years; Chenghai County in Guangdong Province is striving for a yield of 2,735 catties per mu within ten years; the Pioneer Cooperative in Wuyang County, Henan, completed a three-year mountain management plan in forty days... These are just a few examples picked at random. If you look closely at the newspapers, especially the speeches of the representatives at the National People's Congress in recent days, it is truly a scene of colorful splendor, dazzling and overwhelming. Not only the eyes, but also the mind and psychology, feel unable to keep up with the new situation every day.

Every newspaper is filled with words like "Great Leap Forward," "Comparing Enthusiasm," "Spurring the Horse," and "Striving for the Top." This sound of thousands of troops and horses advancing bravely forms a solemn and magnificent symphony resounding through the clouds; this magnificent momentum forms a picture of a grand socialist construction upsurge. In the midst of this, everyone is excited, everyone takes the lead, this unit challenges that unit, this county challenges that county, this agricultural cooperative challenges that agricultural cooperative, everyone is vying to be first, full of spirit, to make contributions to socialism, to be heroes of socialism. It seems that the fire that has been buried for thousands of years has suddenly burst forth.

Faced with this upsurge that makes people unable to calm down, I suddenly thought that someone had criticized the Communist Party for being fond of great achievements. It seems they were right. Although the above examples are only one in ten thousand of the upsurge, do they not also prove the Communist Party members and the people's fondness for great achievements? However, what is wrong with this fondness for great achievements? Looking back on the past, everything shows that we Communists have always been fond of great things and fond of achieving them. When the Communist Party was founded, it only had fifty members, but it publicly announced its great ambition to fight for the liberation of all the Chinese people. At that time, this lofty ambition was once ridiculed as a fantasy and a mere empty talk by the ruling class and even bourgeois scholars; however, in less than forty years, what great changes have taken place on the land of China! Now, the Party is leading 600 million people to run forward on the road of socialism, and has also proposed that in fifteen years, it will catch up with or surpass an old capitalist country in the world in several major industrial products. This is another great ambition. But in the future, will we be satisfied with merely catching up with an imperialist country? No, we don't care about the current England, or even the United States. We will also join the Soviet Union and all socialist countries to build the most beautiful society in human history—Communist society—on this earth!

At this point, I can't help but stop writing and think deeply: Why did a Communist Party with only fifty people dare to have the great ambition to transform such a large China at the beginning, and move forward without stopping? The reason is that this Party has relied on and depended on such people from the beginning; and such people are led by such a Party. The liberation of people, the liberation of productive forces, especially the liberation under such unity and such leadership, its power is unlimited and even unimaginable. The current leap forward, for the great Party leading the great people to engage in great undertakings, is only a small show of talent.

The Communist Party, relying on and guiding this force to engage in the cause of mankind, must be careful and cautious in everything, strive for victory, and be a promoter in all aspects. Therefore, any "achievement" that is beneficial to socialism, no matter how big or small, no matter where it is, no matter whether it is domestic or foreign, we are always happy about it. Any plan or suggestion that is beneficial to the socialist leap forward, even if it is a little bit of experience, we are happy about it and will do our best to promote its realization.

In the final analysis, Communists have always been fond of the greatness of revolution, fond of the greatness of socialism; fond of the achievements of revolution, fond of the achievements of socialism. In order to achieve this "greatness" and "achievement," the Communist Party has fought for more than thirty years, and will continue to fight tirelessly in the future. There is no ambiguity about this. The rightists also like great achievements, but they like the greatness of counter-revolution and the achievements of counter-revolution. However, the "fondness for great achievements" of the rightists violates the will of the people and the course of history, so they only end up playing the role of a mantis trying to stop a chariot.

But in our ranks, there are still a small number of people who seem like children who have just learned to walk. They are used to taking small steps, and when they take a big step, they panic. "Don't be rash!" "Don't be blind!" "Don't break the rules casually!" "Don't...!" "Don't...!" These comrades are "well-intentioned," but quotation marks should be added to the word "well-intentioned." Because this good intention can only promote conservatism and slowness, but cannot help build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and cannot help catch up with or surpass England in fifteen years. They always lament that our country "has a weak foundation" and is "poor and blank." However, they only lament and do not actively change it. They follow old routines and dare not cross the thunder pool. This is because they neither understand the great role of the Communist Party nor the high level of awareness of the masses and the endless revolutionary enthusiasm that comes with it. These short-sighted people who are content with the status quo and muddle along will be left far behind by the times if they do not catch up quickly! Not "fond of great achievements" but "fond of small successes," where is there any connection with the Communist's ambition to transform the world?

We will never be satisfied with the current "small show of talent," although it has already brought us great excitement and encouragement. We need more greatness, more achievements! So that we can cheer ourselves up, make our friends happy, and make our enemies tremble!

### “好大喜功”和小试锋芒

　　“好大喜功”和小试锋芒
　　梁汝怀
    人们曾经用“应接不暇”来形容山阴道上的景色，我没有到过浙东，不曾亲身经历那种妙境。但是最近一个时期的报纸，倒确实显示了在全国范围内社会主义跃进高潮的无限美妙的景色。
    看吧！今年要产钢六百二十四万吨，要产煤一亿五千多万吨；甘肃省决心苦战三年改变全省面貌；福建争取五年内实现千斤省；江苏省四年内成为
  “四无”省；上海的三个橡胶厂保证在四、五年内赶上英国“邓禄普”轮胎水平；广东澄海县争取十年内每亩产量二千七百三十五斤；河南舞阳县先锋社三年治山规划，四十天完成……这只是随手拈来的几个例子，如果仔细看看报纸，特别是近几天全国人民代表大会会议上代表们的发言，真是万紫千红，令人眼花缭乱，应接不暇。不仅是眼睛上，而且是思想上，心理上，每天都感到赶不上新形势了。
    张张报纸上都是“大跃进”、“比干劲”、“快马加鞭”、“力争上游”的字样。这一片千军万马奋勇前进的脚步声，组成了一曲响彻云霄的庄严雄壮的交响乐；这一片气势磅礴的干劲，组成了规模宏伟的社会主义建设高潮的图景。在这中间，人人振奋，个个当先，这个单位向那个单位挑战，这个县向那个县挑战，这个农业社向那个农业社挑战，大家争先恐后，意气昂扬，要为社会主义立功，要做社会主义的功臣。好像是埋藏了几千年的火种一时都迸发了出来。
    面对着这种使人不能平静的高潮，我忽然想到有人曾经批评过共产党好大喜功。看来他们真是说对了。以上这些事例，虽只是高潮中的千万分之一，岂不也证明共产党人和人民群众的好大喜功么？然而这种好大喜功又有什么不好？回顾往事，事事又都说明我们共产党人从来都是好大而又喜功的。共产党成立的时候，只有五十个党员，然而它就公开宣布了要为解放全中国人民而奋斗的大志，在当时，这种远大的志向，是曾经被统治阶级以至资产阶级学者们斥为狂想、讥为空谈的；然而不到四十年工夫，在中国的土地上，起了多么大的变化！现在，党在领导着六亿人民在社会主义的道路上向前奔，又提出了十五年后要在若干主要工业产品上赶上或者超过世界上一个老牌资本主义国家，这又是一个大志。可是，将来我们难道会为仅仅赶上一个帝国主义国家就满足了吗？不，我们才不稀罕现在这样的英国、甚至美国，我们还要同苏联及一切社会主义国家一起，在这地球上建立人类历史上最美好的社会——共产主义社会呢！
    至此，我不禁住笔深思：为什么一个五十个人的共产党于初立之时，就敢于有改造偌大一个中国的大志，而且一往直前，永无休止，原因就在于：这个党一开始就信赖和依靠着这样的人民；而这样的人民又受着这样党的领导。人的解放，生产力的解放，特别是处于这样的团结与这样的领导下的解放，其威力是无可限量甚至不可想像的。眼前的飞跃，对于伟大的党领导着伟大的人民、从事伟大的功业来说，又只不过是小试锋芒而已。
    依靠着而又引导着这股力量去从事人类的功业的共产党，既要事事小心谨慎，力求必胜，又要在一切方面担当促进派。因而任何有利于社会主义的“功”，事无分大小，地无分南北，国无分中外，我们总是高兴的。任何有利于社会主义大跃进的规划、建议，那怕是点点滴滴的经验，我们也都是欢喜的，要尽力促其实现的。
    说到底，共产党人从来就是好革命之大，好社会主义之大；喜革命之功，喜社会主义之功。为了求得这个“大”和“功”，共产党前仆后继，奋斗了三十多年，今后也还要永不停止地奋斗下去。这是一点也不含糊的。右派分子其实也好大喜功，只是他们好反革命之大，喜反革命之功而已。可是右派分子的“好大喜功”是违反人民意志、违反历史的进程的，所以他们只落得一个扮演螳臂当车的小丑角色的下场。
    但是在我们的队伍里，也还有那么一小部分人，好像刚学走路的孩子，走惯了小步子，一跨开大步，就惊慌失措。“不要冒进！”“不要盲动！”“不要随便打破常规！”“不要……！”“不要……！”这些同志是“好心”人，但是在“好心”二字上要加引号。因为这个好心只能助长保守和迟缓，却不能有助于多、快、好、省地建设社会主义，不能有助于十五年内赶上或者超过英国。他们总是感慨于我们国家“底子不厚”，“又穷又白”。然而他们却仅止于感慨而已，并没有积极起来改变它，他们因循于陈旧的常规中，不敢越雷池一步。这是因为他们既不了解共产党的巨大作用，也不了解群众觉悟的高涨和随之而来的无穷无尽的革命干劲。这些安于现状、得过且过的短视者，如果不赶快追上前去，就会被时代抛得老远！不“好大喜功”，反而“好小喜过”，这同共产主义者要改造世界的气概，哪里还有半点相干？
    我们是决不会满足于目前的“小试锋芒”的，虽然它已经给我们带来了莫大的兴奋和鼓舞。我们需要更多的大，更多的功！好让自己振奋，让朋友高兴，让敌人战栗！
