Flowers Blooming Everywhere, Fruits Bearing in All Seasons
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

　　Developing fruit tree production is closely related to maintaining water and soil, promoting economic prosperity, especially in mountainous areas, increasing people's income, accumulating foreign exchange, and promoting industrialization.

　　China has a vast territory, with over a hundred varieties of excellent fruits in cold, temperate, subtropical, and tropical zones, blooming everywhere and bearing fruit in all seasons. Since liberation, thanks to the attention of the Party and the government, the production of various fruits has recovered and developed to varying degrees. According to incomplete statistics, the total output of six fruits—apples, citrus, pears, bananas, grapes, and pineapples—in 1957 was 131% of that in 1952. During the first Five-Year Plan, approximately two million mu of new orchards were developed. During this period, the total export value of apples and citrus alone could be exchanged for seven thousand two hundred and ninety-three kilometers of steel rails (double track). Because the development of fruit tree production has played a significant role in boosting the rural economy and improving people's lives, in many major apple, citrus, and walnut production areas, fruit income accounts for more than half, or even seven-tenths, of the total agricultural income. For example, the famous Deli Temple Cooperative in Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, has more than 145,000 apple trees, and fruit income accounts for 64.5% of the cooperative's total income. The average income per household in the cooperative was more than 600 yuan in 1956, and it is estimated to reach around 1,000 yuan in 1957. Due to the development of fruit tree production, the Friendship Fruit Farmers' Cooperative in Longxi County, Fujian Province, expanded its capital construction, established four small-scale water conservancy projects, expanded the irrigation area by more than 2,400 mu, and built new houses and warehouses. In 1956, each work-day earned a dividend of 2.65 yuan. Among the 586 households in the cooperative, 143 reached the living standards of local prosperous middle peasants in the same year. There are many such examples in fruit-producing areas across the country.

　　However, in terms of the national fruit tree production, high yields are the exception, slow yield increases are the majority, and there are still a certain number of orchards suffering from poor management, declining yields, and reduced quality. Looking at famous fruits, apple production has more than doubled pre-war levels, and the planting area has expanded nearly fourfold during the first Five-Year Plan; while citrus production is only 80% of pre-war levels, and the planting area has only expanded by 65%. Regionally speaking, Liaoning Province attaches great importance to fruit tree production, and the number of apple trees planted during the first Five-Year Plan exceeded more than twice the original number, while the development in Sichuan, Hunan, and other provinces famous for citrus production has been slower. Some of China's famous fruit products, such as Feicheng peaches, Laiyang pears, and Dongling dates, have either not increased production rapidly enough or have been decreasing, and a few famous varieties are even in danger of disappearing. After liberation, the production departments paid attention to guiding the production of fruits suitable for long-distance transportation and export, such as apples and citrus, which was correct; but they did not pay enough attention to some regional varieties, such as apricots, persimmons, and grapes for winemaking, so fruit tree production could not universally and significantly increase production, failing to meet the needs of the domestic market supply and export.

　　The promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Outline (Revised Draft) and the convening of the Mountainous Area Production Conference have pointed out a clear direction for future fruit tree production: comprehensive planning, strengthening leadership, adapting to local conditions, relying on the masses, and vigorously developing fruit tree production in a planned manner, expanding old bases, establishing new bases, improving the yield and quality of existing fruit trees, and correspondingly doing a good job in purchasing, marketing, and processing. We should mainly rely on the strength of cooperatives to cultivate in large quantities in mountainous areas, hills, sandy wastelands, urban and rural vacant land, and areas where fruit trees can be cultivated, and appropriately establish some state-owned orchards to play a demonstrative leading and technical guidance role.

　　It is entirely possible to greatly develop fruit trees and increase the fruit tree planting area to more than eight times the current area in ten years. We have 100 million peasant households and vast mountainous and sandy wastelands. If each household plants one fruit tree, there will be more than 100 million trees. After the old course of the Yellow River is developed, it is initially estimated that 1 million to 1.5 million mu of various fruit trees can be planted. The development of mountainous areas and the planting of fruit trees are especially limitless. China now has more than 10 million mu of established orchards and more than 290 nurseries. As long as the existing nurseries are planned and managed well, some more nurseries are built, and the mass breeding of seedlings by cooperatives is greatly developed, the problem of seedling supply can also be solved. Mi County, Henan Province, relied on the masses to cultivate more than 500 mu of fruit seedlings in one year without requiring the state to spend money.

　　1958 is the first year of the second Five-Year Plan. Doing a good job in fruit tree work this year is of great significance for realizing the fruit tree production plan of the second and third Five-Year Plans. To this end, we must vigorously carry out the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests in orchards, which is the primary key to increasing fruit production. At the same time, we must strengthen orchard management, increase fertilizer application, and pay attention to taking drought resistance and flood prevention measures. A few agricultural cooperatives have not implemented contracting for production, increasing production rewards, and dedicated management of fruit trees, which has hindered the mobilization of enthusiasm and should be improved.

　　Fruit trees are perennial crops. In order to complete the ten-year long-term plan, while improving the production of existing orchards in 1958, we must seize specific plans and seedling work. This work should be combined with the overall agricultural comprehensive plan. For production bases, we must specifically organize forces to conduct on-site planning, and determine the development areas, area, and types of fruit trees to be developed. Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan provinces must complete the investigation and planning work of the old course of the Yellow River in 1958, which is an extremely valuable work for benefiting the people for ten years.

　　Purchasing departments and processing departments should vigorously support this production, do a good job in pre-purchasing fruits, and issue earnest money in a timely manner. For mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation, we must also find ways to transport them out. If they really cannot be transported out, the processing departments should find ways to process them or help the masses process them themselves to encourage production enthusiasm. More than 20 counties in Shanxi Province have established small-scale drying factories; commercial departments in Xinglong, Miyun, and other counties in Hebei Province have established small-scale processing factories in mountainous areas or jointly with agricultural cooperatives. This requires less state investment and can increase the income of the masses.

　　遍地开花四季结果
　　本报评论员
    发展果树生产，对于保持水土、繁荣经济尤其是山区经济，增加人民收入和积累外汇，促进工业化，都有密切的关系。
    我国地区广阔，有寒带、温带、亚热带和热带的各类优良果品一百多种，遍地开花，四季结果。解放以后由于党和政府的重视，各类果品生产有了不同程度的恢复和发展。根据不完全的统计，苹果、柑桔、梨、香蕉、葡萄、菠萝六种果品的总产量1957年为1952年的131％。第一个五年计划期间新发展了果树约二百多万亩。这期间单是苹果、柑桔的出口总值就可换回钢轨（双轨）七千二百九十三公里。由于果树生产的发展对繁荣农村经济、改善人民生活起了显著作用，不少苹果、柑桔、核桃的主要产区，果品收入占到农业总收入的一半以上，甚至十分之七。如著名的辽宁省复县得利寺合作社有苹果树十四万五千多棵，果品收入占到该社总收入的64.5％，全社1956年平均每户收入六百多元，1957年预计平均达到一千元左右。福建龙溪县友谊果农社由于果树生产的发展，基本建设扩大了，建立了小型水利四处，扩大灌溉面积二千四百多亩，并新建了房屋和仓库。1956年每个劳动日分红为二元六角五分。该社共五百八十六户，当年就有一百四十三户达到当地富裕中农的生活水平。像这样的例子，全国果树产区是很多的。
    但是，果树生产在全国来说，高产的是少数，产量提高缓慢的是多数，管理不善、产量和质量下降的还有一定数量。从著名果类来看，苹果产量已超过战前一倍以上，种植面积在第一个五年计划期间扩大了近四倍；而柑桔产量却只及战前80％，种植面积只扩大65％。从地区上说，辽宁省很重视果树生产，第一个五年计划期间种植的苹果树超过原有数的两倍多，而著名产柑桔的四川、湖南等省发展的就慢些。我国一些名产果品如肥城桃、莱阳梨、东陵枣等，有的增产不快，有的日益减少，少数名种并且有绝迹的危险。解放后生产部门对适合远运的外销果品如苹果、柑桔等的生产注意了领导，这是对的；但对一些地区性的品种如杏、柿和酿造用的如葡萄等就注意得很不够，因而果树生产不能普遍地大量增产，满足不了国内市场供应和出口的需要。
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的公布和山区生产会议的召开，给今后果树生产指出了明确的方针：全面规划，加强领导，因地制宜，依靠群众，有计划地大力发展果树生产，扩大老基地，建立新基地，提高现有果树的产量和质量，相应地作好购销和加工工作。主要依靠合作社的力量，在山区、丘陵、沙荒、城乡空地以及可以栽培果树的地区大量栽培，并适当地建立一些国营果园，起示范带头和技术指导的作用。
    大量发展果树，在十年以后使果树种植面积增加到现在的八倍以上，是完全可能的。我们有一亿农户和广大的山区和沙荒，如果每户种植一株果树，就有一亿多株。黄河故道开发起来，初步估计可种各种果树一百万到一百五十万亩。开发山区，种植果树，尤其不可限量。我国现在已经有一千多万亩成园，二百九十余处苗圃，只要有计划地管理好现有苗圃，再兴建一些苗圃，并大量发展合作社育苗，苗木供应的问题也是能够解决的。河南密县依靠群众一年中就培育果苗五百多亩，并没有要国家花钱。
    1958年是第二个五年计划的头一年，作好这一年的果树工作，对于实现第二、第三个五年计划的果树生产规划具有重大意义。为此必须大力开展果园的病虫害防治工作，这是增产果品的首要关键。同时要加强果园管理，增施肥料，注意采取抗旱防涝措施。有少数农业社对果树没有实行包工包产、增产奖励和专人管理，防碍了积极性的发挥，应当改善。
    果树是多年生作物，为了完成十年远景规划，1958年在提高现有果园生产的同时，必须抓紧具体计划，育苗工作。这工作要结合整个农业全面规划进行。对生产基地，要专门组织力量进行现地规划，把发展的地区、面积和发展果树的种类定下来。江苏、安徽、山东、河南四省，1958年要完成黄河故道的勘查规划工作，这是一项十年兴利的极有价值的工作。
    收购部门和加工部门，要大力支持这一生产，作好果品预购，及时发放定金。对交通不便的山区，也要设法运出。实在运不出的，加工部门要设法加工，或帮助群众自己加工，以鼓励生产热情。山西省有二十多个县设立了小型烤干厂；河北省兴隆、密云等县商业部门在山区设立或者同农业社合办小型加工厂。这样作国家投资少，又能增加群众收入。
