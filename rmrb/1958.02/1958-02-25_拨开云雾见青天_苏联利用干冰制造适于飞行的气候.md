Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 24th. The Central High-Altitude Meteorological Laboratory near Moscow is "cleaning" the sky with "dry ice," able to clear clouds and fog from airports within minutes, creating weather suitable for flight. Sometimes, the laboratory's cloud-clearing aircraft can fly thousands of kilometers at a time, "sweeping" several large airports.

The Soviet magazine "Young Generation" recently detailed the experiments of this "climate maker." The magazine pointed out that not long ago, an "IL-12" aircraft was flying at a very high altitude. Below the wings was a vast expanse of white clouds. The thermometer read minus eight degrees Celsius. The director of the laboratory, Gaivoronsky, selected the cloud to be "treated" and sent a signal to the pilot. The pilot steered the plane into the cloud layer, diving down a hundred meters. After the command "Start influencing!" was issued, a female experimenter picked up a tool resembling a pistol and extended the muzzle into a small hole in the ceiling of the cabin, as if "shooting" at the clouds. Then the "pistol" was immediately retracted into the cabin, and glass slides were used to study the air temperature. By examining a drop of cloud falling on the glass under a microscope, much can be learned about the nature of the cloud layer. Then the meteorological engineer started up a white cabinet filled with chunks of "dry ice" (solid carbon dioxide). The ice particles were thrown into the clouds and immediately turned into invisible tiny crystals. Each kilogram of "dry ice" can produce ten billion billion tiny crystals. As a result, the moisture in the clouds clustered around these tiny crystals as nuclei, forming large raindrops and falling as rain. The ground was irrigated. And a large patch of azure gap appeared in the cloudy sky. Sunlight shone through this large gap to the ground.

The magazine pointed out that this is only the first step in climate control. Soon, mankind will completely control the climate. At that time, each region may be able to order climate from the central climate station's order bureau. Special aircraft from the climate station can "create" heavy rain over the wheat fields of southern Ukraine according to orders, prevent storms on the Kubyshev Sea on the Volga River, and so on.

### 拨开云雾见青天  苏联利用干冰制造适于飞行的气候

    拨开云雾见青天
    苏联利用干冰制造适于飞行的气候
    新华社莫斯科24日电　莫斯科近郊的中央高空气象实验室用“干冰”打扫天空，能够在几分钟内为飞机场扫开云雾，制造适于飞行的天气。有时实验室清除云雾用的飞机一次能飞行好几千公里，为好几个大机场“扫”云。
    苏联“青年一代”杂志最近详细介绍了这个“气候制造者”的实验情况。杂志指出，不久前，一架“伊尔十二式”飞机在很高的高空飞行。机翼下是大片的白云。温度表指着零下八度。实验室主任盖沃隆斯基选出了要“处理”的云，给飞行员发出了信号。飞行员把飞机开入云层，向下俯冲了一百公尺。“开始影响！”的命令发出后，女实验员拿起了一个像手枪的工具，把枪口伸到机舱天花板上的小孔中，好像是向云层“开枪”。接着“手枪”马上被收回舱内，开始用载物玻璃片来研究空气温度。通过落在玻璃上的一滴云在显微镜下可以了解有关云层本质的许多问题。然后气象工程师就开动一个装满了“干冰”块（固体二氧化碳）的白橱柜。冰粒被抛到云中，立即变成看不见的小晶粒，每公斤“干冰”可以产生一百亿亿个小晶粒。结果云中的水分都以这些小晶粒为核心聚集成大水滴，变成雨降下来。地面得到了灌溉。而乌云密布的天空现出了一大片蔚蓝的空隙。阳光穿过这一大片空隙晒到地面上。
    杂志指出，这在控制气候方面还只是第一步。不久人类就会完全控制气候。到那时，各区也许可以向中央气候站订货局预订气候。气候站的特种飞机可以按照订单在南乌克兰的麦田上“制造”大雨，在伏尔加河的古比雪夫海上制止风暴等等。
