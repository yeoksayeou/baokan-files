    Seven Bone Meal Factories
    Guizhou Province is newly building and expanding seven small bone meal factories in places such as Bijie and Tongren. The Anshun and Zunyi bone meal factories, which started construction earlier, have recently been completed and put into production.
    These newly built and expanded bone meal factories can provide more than 3.68 million jin of bone fertilizer for agricultural production in mountainous areas every year, creating certain conditions for realizing a great leap forward in agricultural production.
    The newly built bone meal factories do not build new factory buildings, but instead use empty rooms and old houses; in terms of production equipment, iron pots are used instead of boilers, and stone rollers are used instead of pulverizers. In this way, construction is fast and investment is low. (Xinhua News Agency)

    七个骨粉厂
    贵州省正在毕节、铜仁等地新建和扩建七个小型骨粉厂。施工较早的安顺、遵义两个骨粉厂已在最近完工投入生产。
    这些新建和扩建的骨粉厂每年可以为山区农业生产提供三百六十八万多斤骨肥，为实现农业生产大跃进创造一定的条件。
    新建的骨粉厂都不新盖厂房，而是利用空房旧屋；在生产设备上，也是用铁锅代替锅炉，用石辗代替磨粉机。这样，建设既快，投资也少。　（新华社）
