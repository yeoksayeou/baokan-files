Fire is burning, burning brightly. This fire is not the sinister fire set by the right-wingers last spring—it has long been extinguished by the heroic people. This fire is the fire against waste, the "Samadhi Fire" of myths and legends. It not only burns away waste and saves funds in socialist construction, but also burns away some old habits and tempers people's thinking. This fire is burning, fiercely burning, in various organizations, schools, factories, and rural areas.

Let's take a look at the fire against waste in Shanghai's institutions of higher learning; it's exhilarating. The People's Daily reported on January 31 that twelve universities and colleges in Shanghai, in their fight against waste, mobilized the masses to re-examine this year's expenditure plans and decided to cut expenses by five million yuan. A fire burned out five million yuan, which is no small amount. Imagine how many organizations, schools, and factories there are across the country. If they could all burn away waste like this, how much money would be burned out! How much could be done for our socialist construction with this money. In the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," there is a story of the Battle of Red Cliffs, where a fire burned Cao Cao's 830,000 troops to a frazzle, causing a great defeat. May our current fire against waste also burn vigorously and fiercely, burning away waste completely. Let each of us be a "cook" to ignite the fire against waste!

The fire against waste burns away not only waste but, more importantly, old habits. Let's take that news item as an example: "Through special forums and exhibitions, the vast number of teachers, students, and staff realized that running schools with diligence and frugality is not only for saving the people's sweat but also related to the fundamental question of what kind of students socialist institutions of higher learning should cultivate and how to cultivate them… The atmosphere of competing in diligence and frugality has replaced the old atmosphere of competing in ostentation and extravagance, and in being big and new."

Is this a simple matter? It is not simple! Those who read the newspapers in early January will clearly remember that one of those twelve universities and colleges—Fudan University—wasn't it wantonly squandering the people's hard-earned money, talking lavishly and extravagantly, building what were called "dog palaces" and "chicken coops"? And what is it like now? "The atmosphere of competing in diligence and frugality has replaced the old atmosphere of competing in ostentation and extravagance." Moreover, as the news said, "Universities and colleges throughout the city have successively put forward the slogan of learning from Fudan and catching up with Fudan." How can people not be happy to see this! People are the most precious, and the transformation of people's thinking and style is of a value that cannot be compared to "five million yuan." This is a manifestation of increased political awareness and strengthened revolutionary vigor. Writing this, I cannot but pay tribute to these heroic "cooks" who ignited the fire against waste!

"Burn away old habits, temper new thinking." Fire, may you burn even more brightly!

    火，熊熊地燃烧吧！
    天马
    火在燃烧着，熊熊地燃烧着。这火不是去年春天右派分子放的妖火——它早已被英勇的人们扑灭了。这火是反浪费之火，是神话传说里的“三昧真火”，它不仅烧掉社会主义建设中的浪费，节约了资金，而且烧掉了一些旧的风气，锻炼了人的思想。这火正在各机关、学校、工厂和农村燃烧着，猛烈地燃烧着。
    让我们看一看上海高等学校的反浪费之火吧，这是令人兴奋的。1月31日人民日报载，上海十二所高等学校在反浪费中，发动群众重新审查今年经费开支计划，决定减削经费五百万元。一把火就烧出了五百万元，这是个不小的数目。设想一下，全国有多少机关、学校和工厂，若都能这样火烧浪费，那烧出来多少钱来呢！用这些钱将为我们的社会主义建设做多少事啊。“三国志”中有一段火烧赤壁，一把火烧得曹操八十三万人马焦头烂额，大败而归。愿我们现在的反浪费之火也烧得旺，烧得猛，把浪费烧得干净。让我们每一人都来做“火头军”，把反浪费之火点起来吧！
    反浪费之火烧掉的不仅是浪费，更重要的是旧的风气。还是引那条消息为例吧：“通过专题鸣放、举办展览会，广大师生员工认识到勤俭办校不仅为了节约人民的汗，而且关系到社会主义的高等学校应当培养什么样的学生和怎样培养学生这一根本问题。……比勤俭、比节约的风气已经代替了过去比排场气派、比大、比新的旧风气。”
    这是简单的事情么？不简单！看过1月上旬报纸的人，都还清楚地记得，就是那十二所高等学校中的一个——复旦大学，过去不是在大肆挥霍人民血汗，大讲排场阔气，修什么“狗宫”、“鸡楼”之类么？而现在如何呢？“比勤俭、比节约的风气已经代替了过去比排场气派”的旧风气。而且像消息中所说的“全市各高校纷纷提出了要学习复旦、追赶复旦”的口号。看了这怎不叫人高兴！人是最宝贵的，人的思想作风的转变，其价值不是“五百万元”所能比拟的。这是政治觉悟提高和革命干劲加强的表现。写到这里，我不能不向这些英勇地点起反浪费之火的“火头军”们致敬！
    “烧掉旧风气，锻炼新思想”。火，你更熊熊地燃烧吧！
