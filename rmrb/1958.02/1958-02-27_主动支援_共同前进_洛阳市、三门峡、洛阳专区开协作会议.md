Proactive Support, Common Progress
Luoyang City, Sanmenxia, and Luoyang Prefecture Hold Collaboration Meeting

(Our dispatch) The Luoyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Luoyang Prefectural Committee, and the Sanmenxia Municipal Committee recently held their first regional collaboration meeting in Luoyang City. The meeting was filled with an atmosphere of proactively supporting others and harmonious unity from beginning to end.

Comrade Wang Huizhi, Secretary of the Luoyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said: The first difficulty encountered by Luoyang Prefecture in water conservancy construction was the lack of cement. In leveling land, the entire prefecture had several hundred million cubic meters of earthwork, lacking machinery. Some places created some machinery, but no one provided technical appraisal. In addition, the prefecture also requested Luoyang City to produce a large number of small generators, universal small tractors, etc. Although Sanmenxia City has many difficulties in construction, the responsible comrades of the Municipal Committee immediately proposed after hearing these requests: to support 1,000 tons of cement in the first quarter, and if there is a need to make cement pipes, they will also be responsible for sending workers to the site for manufacturing; they also promised to help the three counties of Shanxian, Lingbao, and Lushi solve the technical problems encountered in building large reservoirs; and they also promised to allocate some machinery needed for leveling land to support Luoyang Prefecture. The Luoyang Municipal Committee also proposed to support the prefecture in twelve aspects.

The main requirements put forward by Sanmenxia City were manpower and material supply issues. They requested an increase in the number of salespeople and administrative cadres, laborers, and vegetable supplies, etc. The Luoyang Municipal Committee and the Luoyang Prefectural Committee also immediately agreed to help solve these problems. The Luoyang Municipal Committee also plans to support Sanmenxia with an ice cream factory, including the workers in the factory. Other supplies such as cloth will be met as much as possible to Sanmenxia’s requirements.

In the exchange of information, the Luoyang Prefectural Committee also introduced the surface and underground resources of Luoyang Prefecture, which provided good information for both parties to formulate development plans for local industry.

    主动支援　共同前进
    洛阳市、三门峡、洛阳专区开协作会议
    本报讯　中共洛阳市委、洛阳地委、三门峡市委不久以前在洛阳市举行了首次地区协作会议。会议自始至终充满了主动支援别人、和睦团结的气氛。
    中共洛阳地委书记王慧智同志说：洛阳专区在水利建设中首先碰到的困难是缺乏水泥；平整土地上，全区有好几亿土方任务，缺乏机械，有些地方创造了些机械，也没有人在技术上给以鉴定。此外，专区还要求洛阳市大量生产小型发电机、万能小型拖拉机等。三门峡市在建设中虽然有很多困难，但是该市市委负责同志听到这些要求以后，立即提出：一季度支援水泥一千吨，如果需要制水泥管，还负责派工人到现场制造；还答应帮助陕县、灵宝、卢氏三个县解决修大型水库所遇到的技术问题。还答应抽出一部分平整土地所需的机械支援洛阳专区。洛阳市委也提出从十二个方面支援专区。
    三门峡市提出的主要要求是人力和物资供应问题。他们要求增加一些营业员和行政干部、力工以及蔬菜供应等，洛阳市委和洛阳地委也当场答应帮助解决。洛阳市委还计划支援三门峡一个冰棒厂，包括厂内的工人。其它布匹等供应尽可能满足三门峡要求。
    在互通情报中，洛阳地委还介绍了洛阳专区地面和地下资源情况，这为双方编制发展地方工业规划提供了良好资料。
