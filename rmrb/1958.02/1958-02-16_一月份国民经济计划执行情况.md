Editor's Note: How is our national economic plan being executed each month? Who is executing it best? Who is executing it relatively poorly? This is something everyone cares about. For this reason, we have decided to open up a special column to provide a comprehensive report on the execution of the national economic plan for the previous month, based on data from the State Statistical Bureau, in the first and middle ten days of each month.

The execution of the plan in January 1958 in the industrial, capital construction, commercial, and transportation sectors is as follows:

All Industrial Ministries and Local Industries Exceeded the Monthly Plan

The nation completed a total industrial output value of 5.1 billion yuan, exceeding the monthly plan by 2.5%, an increase of 17.1% compared to the same period last year. All central industrial ministries exceeded the monthly plan, an increase of 22.8% compared to the same period last year. Local industrial enterprises completed 102.3% of the monthly plan, an increase of 15.1% compared to the same period last year. Hunan, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, and Anhui provinces did not complete the monthly plan, but each increased by 10%, 10%, 31%, 36%, and 52% respectively compared to the same period last year.

Of the 32 major national products, 24 completed or exceeded the monthly plan. Although six products, including pig iron, steam boilers, metal cutting machine tools,麻袋(ma dai - gunny sacks or burlap bags), edible vegetable oil, and sugar, did not complete the plan, compared to the same period last year, all five products except steam boilers, which maintained last year's level, had varying degrees of increase (the monthly plans for raw coal and trucks were missing, so they were not checked).

The number of industrial employees at the end of January was approximately 7.34 million, a slight decrease compared to the end of 1957.

Basic Construction Plan Completion Exceeds Previous Years

The nation actually completed approximately 420 million yuan in basic construction investment. Among them, the construction and installation workload reached 290 million yuan. Due to seasonal factors, the January investment amount was only 2.9% of the annual investment plan, but the plan completion was better than in previous years (the highest investment amount completed in January in previous years was no more than 350 million yuan, and plan completion was always below 2.5%).

Of the projects aided by the Soviet Union to China, 87 were under construction this month, with an investment of 90 million yuan completed, accounting for 3.6% of the annual plan. Among these, construction and installation projects completed 60 million yuan, accounting for 5% of the annual plan, both higher than the national average.

The number of employees in construction and installation enterprises was approximately 1.48 million, a slight decrease compared to the end of 1957.

Sales Volume of Major Commodities Decreased

Due to the continued implementation of the spirit of building the country and managing households diligently and thriftily, the sales volume of major commodities in January decreased to varying degrees compared to December 1957. Grain decreased by 490 million jin, edible oil decreased by 23.57 million jin, pigs decreased by 693,000 heads, cotton cloth decreased by 120 million meters, and kerosene decreased by 11,000 tons. Compared to the same period last year, except for kerosene which increased, all others also decreased.

Due to the results of socialist education that began in rural areas last year, farmers sold grain and cotton in advance, and the procurement plan was completed ahead of schedule. Therefore, the procurement figures for grain and cotton in January this year were lower than in the same period last year.

Railway Passenger Volume Decreased Compared to the Same Period Last Year

Railway freight volume completed 101.3% of the monthly plan, an increase of 6.3% compared to the same period last year, and freight turnover (monthly plan missing) increased by 5.7%. Compared with the same period last year, passenger transport: passenger volume decreased by 20.8%, and passenger turnover decreased by 27.8%.

The Ministry of Transportation's inland river freight transport completed the plan. Coastal freight transport did not complete the plan. Neither inland river nor coastal passenger transport completed the plan.

    一月份国民经济计划执行情况
    编者按：每一个月，我们的国民经济计划执行得怎样？谁执行得最好？谁执行得比较差？这是大家都关心的。为此，我们决定辟这样一个专栏，在每月上、中旬，根据国家统计局的资料，把上个月的国民经济计划执行情况作一个综合的报道。
    1958年1月份工业、基建、商业、交通运输等部门的计划执行情况如下：
    各工业部和地方工业超额完成了月计划
    全国完成工业总产值五十一亿元，超额2.5％完成了月计划，比去年同期增长17.1％；中央各工业部均超额完成了月计划，比去年同期增长22.8％；地方工业企业完成月计划102.3％，比去年同期增长15.1％。湖南、黑龙江、甘肃、青海、安徽五省未完成月计划，但比去年同期各增加10％、10％、31％、36％、52％。
    三十二种全国主要产品产量中，完成或超额完成月计划的有二十四种。生铁、蒸汽锅炉、金属切削机床、麻袋、食用植物油、糖等六种产品虽未完成计划，但与去年同期比较，除蒸汽锅炉维持去年水平外，其余五种均有不同程度的增长（原煤、载重汽车缺月计划未检查）。
    工业职工1月末人数约为七百三十四万人，较1957年末略有减少。
    基本建设计划完成情况超过往年
    全国实际完成基本建设投资额约四点二亿元。其中，建筑安装工作量达二点九亿元。因季节关系，1月份的投资额仅为年度投资计划的2.9％，但比往年完成计划情况较好（往年1月份完成的投资额最高不过三点五亿元，完成计划均在2.5％以下）。
    苏联援助我国的建设项目，本月份施工的有八十七项，完成投资额零点九亿元，为年度计划的3.6％，其中：建筑安装工程完成零点六亿元，为年度计划的5％，均高于全国平均水平。
    建筑安装企业的职工人数约为一百四十八万人，比1957年年底略有减少。
    主要商品销售量下降
    由于勤俭建国、勤俭持家精神的继续贯彻，1月份主要商品销售量比1957年12月有不同程度的下降。粮食下降四点九亿斤，食油下降二千三百五十七万斤，猪下降六十九点三万头，棉布下降一点二亿公尺，煤油下降一点一万吨，与去年同期比较，除煤油增长外，其他也均下降。
    由于去年农村开始社会主义教育的结果，农民提前出售粮、棉，收购计划提前完成，故今年1月份的收购粮棉数字，较去年同期有所减少。
    铁路客运量比去年同期减少
    铁路货运量完成月计划的101.3％，比去年同期增长6.3％，货物周转量（缺月计划）增长5.7％。客运与去年同期比较：客运量降低20.8％，旅客周转量降低27.8％。
    交通部所属内河运输货运完成了计划。沿海货运未完成计划。内河、沿海的客运均未完成计划。
