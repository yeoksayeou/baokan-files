I heard the report by Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the implementation of the 1957 national budget and the draft 1958 national budget, and the report by Vice Premier Bo Yibo on the draft national economic plan for 1958. Great! Great! They aroused high excitement in me. I also heard the report by Director Wu Yuzhang on the current work of language reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. This scheme is mainly beneficial to the language unification and cultural learning of the broad masses of people throughout the country, to the cultural learning and communication between ethnic minorities and the Han people, and also to the international dissemination of New China's culture. I propose that the budget proposal be approved after legal review, and that the latter two proposals be decided and passed.

From the reports of Vice Premiers Li and Bo, I heard that the broad masses of workers and staff, through the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, have greatly raised their class consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm, thereby increasing labor productivity and employee attendance. This has enabled the vast majority of products, especially high-tax rate products, to overfulfill their planned output, reduce production costs and management expenses, increase profits, and greatly increase state tax revenue. I also heard that in 1957, 65 counties and cities across the country had respectively reached the targets set by the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program for grain production of 400, 500, and 800 jin per mu; and 56 counties and cities had respectively reached the targets of 60, 80, and 100 jin of cotton (lint) per mu, thus completing the tasks stipulated in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program ten years ahead of schedule. I also heard that currently more than 80 million laborers across the country are participating in the construction of farmland water conservancy, and I predict that in 1958, industrial and agricultural production will usher in an unprecedented great leap forward.

International Situation: The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind Domestic Situation: A Great Leap Forward in New Spirit

Here, I would like to cite one or two miracles recently seen in newspapers that are almost unimaginable. The People's Daily on January 12 reported that the director of a cooperative in Jun County, Hubei, created the experience of diverting river water to the hillside, turning dry land into paddy fields. That year, 30 mu were converted, with a yield of 690 jin per mu, which caused a sensation for a time. Guanghua County developed the experience of Jun County, and the Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee promoted the experience of Guanghua County, which had a great impetus on the entire Hubei Province. Currently, more than 5.5 million people in the province are working on water conservancy projects every day. There are 389 large-scale projects, more than 108,900 medium-sized projects, and more than 20,000 small-scale projects have been completed. This is one example. Another example is: The Guangming Daily on January 11 and the Ta Kung Pao on January 12 both reported that in the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture in southern Yunnan, along the hundreds of miles of the national border, there are "Kucong people," numbering two thousand, who live by hunting in the primeval forest. After being forced into the forest to resist the reactionary rulers, they were almost isolated from the world. After liberation, the autonomous prefecture organized a Kucong people's delegation to help them transform their lives. Now hunting has turned into settlement, wooden sticks for self-defense have been replaced by iron farm tools, and individual work has turned into mutual assistance. Children are learning culture in primary schools.

One after another, thousands upon thousands of amazing new things are discovered in newspapers every day. Isn't this obvious to all?

Naturally, a great era for the world is also approaching. Here, I congratulate the establishment of the United Arab Republic, another representative of the anti-colonialist spirit; I estimate that although the convocation of the highest-level meeting between the East and the West is delayed, the movement to eliminate nuclear weapons war will eventually be victorious. There is news that the Soviet Union will launch a satellite that is twice as heavy as the second artificial satellite. What a great encouragement this is to peace-loving people all over the world!

I am extremely excited. Look! In terms of the international situation, it is truly the East wind prevailing over the West wind; domestically, the national spirit of New China is being vigorously promoted in a leap forward! A great leap forward!

Regarding a large Chinese history, to speak more recently, we probably know something about the historical materials of three or four thousand years! Especially in the past few hundred years, especially the eighty years that I have personally experienced, these facts will not be lost in my mind! Why is it that only a short eight years and several months after liberation have there been such amazing and great developments? The truth is right in front of us. As long as we humbly study it, we will surely be able to discover it.

Human beings, especially the working people, have rich potential power and wisdom. Why couldn't they be fully utilized in the past? The problem lies in class oppression and exploitation. They were oppressed and exploited to the point where they could not even maintain their own material needs, let alone come into contact with cultural life. They endured this for thousands of years. The vanguard of the proletariat, the Chinese Communist Party, saw this clearly, that is, the great potential power of the working people. In Mao Zedong's Selected Works, on page 1120 of "On Coalition Government," this point is pointed out. I personally went to Yan'an in 1945 and visited Chairman Mao. During the conversation, he also pointed this out to me. The Chinese Communist Party saw this clearly, so it wisely and vigorously liberated: it liberated the power of the working people; it also liberated the wisdom of the working people. It liberated the productivity of the working people; it also liberated the creativity of the working people. Having liberated them, what path should the working people be led to take? The socialist road. We must realize that only the proletariat can lead the people of the whole country on the socialist road, and only in this way is it possible to eliminate oppression and exploitation.

We must understand that all the amazing new things that are happening before our eyes, everything, arises from this.

Now, people in general are saying "the general trend and the will of the people." But I believe that if we truly understand these eight characters, there are two types of people who especially need to consciously and resolutely accept reform.

Bourgeois Intellectuals Must Be Reformed First Clarify the Political Standpoint of Serving Whom

One type of person is: bourgeois intellectuals. In the past, this group of people thought that mental labor was superior to everything else, but in reality, they were inept in physical labor and unable to distinguish the five grains. Because of their ineptitude in physical labor, they couldn't even distinguish the types of rice they ate every day, yet they called themselves intellectuals, great intellectuals. Aren't they making a fool of themselves! Recently, some people have been consciously seeking a way out. Huang Qingshi, a teacher at the Shanghai Middle School Teachers' Advanced Studies College, wrote to me saying, "The lesson of labor training is necessary for people like me. All knowledge comes from practice. Without practice, there is no knowledge. We cannot call ourselves intellectuals, we can only call ourselves literate people." According to me, even the title of literate person is undeserved. Wasn't writing created by the masses of the people? -- Director Wu Yuzhang's report said so. -- What kind of thing recorded in writing is not the result of the labor of the masses of the people! Just knowing these few symbols, is that considered remarkable! Especially these intellectuals, great intellectuals, the class concept of the majority is vague, and they do not understand the principles of struggle. If they do not quickly reform and intensify training, how can they adapt to the current new situation!

How to reform? Combining this with the requirements of the current rectification movement, the first thing to be solved is the issue of which political standpoint intellectuals serve. We must overcome bourgeois ideology, especially bourgeois individualism. We know that taking the socialist road means that we are absolutely not allowed to carry the baggage of these old bourgeois ideas in our luggage. Only by discarding the baggage of old bourgeois ideas and learning from the worker-peasant masses: learning the labor habits of the worker-peasant masses; learning the collective work of the worker-peasant masses; learning the regular life of the worker-peasant masses; learning the selfless spirit of the worker-peasant masses. By combining mental labor and physical labor and becoming working-class intellectuals, can we easily and happily embark on the socialist road.

"The General Trend" is Due to "The Will of the People" Bourgeois Elements Must Also Dedicate Their "Hearts"

Another type of person who must consciously reform themselves is: bourgeois elements. In 1957, the general industrialists and businessmen handed over their means of production completely to the state, becoming joint state-private enterprises, which is greatly commendable. However, the "hearts" of most people were not handed over to the state, and bourgeois ideas will be exposed at any time. During the rectification movement, a certain place reflected a saying from industrialists and businessmen: "Although the Yangtze River Bridge is good, it is a pity that it cannot be moved to my home." This can be said to be representative enough of bourgeois thinking. In October 1957, after I finished speaking to 14,000 industrial and commercial people in Shanghai, I met a former factory owner. I asked: How is it? You handed over the enterprise, how do you feel? He replied: "This is the general trend!" From this sentence, although it carries some reluctance, it can be considered that he has already recognized the "general trend." I hope that if these friends can further realize that the "general trend" is achieved through the "will of the people," and that it is irresistible and should not be resisted, then that would be good. I believe that as long as the industrial and commercial circles think of the various painful situations they suffered under the reactionary government's rule of bureaucratic capital oppression and collusion with imperialist aggression in the past, and now compare the combination of personal interests with the interests of the country and the people, the two can be compared to judge the good, bad, superior, and inferior of the two paths of the present and the past, socialism and capitalism. Moreover, the socialist construction of New China is developing vigorously, and various construction talents are still needed. As long as friends in the industrial and commercial circles can actively participate in the general rectification movement, that is, through a concentrated movement of self-education and self-transformation, and fundamentally change their political standpoint, contribute their technical and management experience, together with their "hearts," in complete compliance with Article 10 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China regarding the requirements of "transformation." If this is achieved, these will truly become the "wealth of the country."

In general, whether it is bourgeois intellectuals or bourgeois elements, they must first transform their political standpoint and gradually become self-reliant laborers.

I am Willing to Issue a Challenge to the Delegates Present Let Us Compete in Enthusiasm in the Great Movement

As for me personally. I am eighty years old. But to live on, I am now, and will continue in the future under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to earnestly accept transformation and participate in the socialist construction work. At the same time, I will study hard, learn from the working class, and strive to learn and master the Marxist worldview through ideological transformation. I will thoroughly transform myself, who grew up and was raised in bourgeois society for decades, into a working-class intellectual loyal to socialism. I know that this transformation is not easy, but I must strive to do it, and humbly and constantly find my own shortcomings and mistakes.

Strangely enough, since I saw and heard about the current great leap forward in the country in all aspects, it seems as if I have suddenly become much younger. In my heart, I not only feel the warmth of spring, but also a surge of enthusiasm throughout my body.

I have always held revolutionary optimism for decades. Please allow me to issue a challenge to the volunteer delegates present here today. In the currently unfolding general rectification movement and other movements, let us all compare who has greater enthusiasm?

Comrade Delegates! This era is too great. We are too fortunate to be born in this era. Let us understand the great era, transform ourselves into new people, and let us all work hard to build a new socialist China.

Finally, let us all shout to the core force leading our great country forward:

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao!

### 认识大时代，改造做新人，大家鼓起干劲，来建设社会主义新中国  黄炎培副委员长的发言

　　认识大时代，改造做新人，大家鼓起干劲，来建设社会主义新中国
    黄炎培副委员长的发言
    我听到李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告、薄一波副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告，伟大！伟大！激起我高度的兴奋；还听到吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告，这一方案主要是有利于全国广大人民群众的语言统一和文化学习，有利于少数民族和汉族间的文化学习和沟通，还有利于新中国文化在国际间的传播。这三案我提议预算案经过依法审查后予以批准，后两案予以决定和通过。
    我从李副总理、薄副总理两份报告中间听到广大职工群众通过反右派斗争和整风运动，大大地提高了阶级觉悟和革命积极性，从而提高了劳动生产率、职工出勤率，使绝大多数产品特别是高税率产品的产量都超额完成计划，降低了生产成本和管理费用，增加了利润，使国家税收大大地增加。还听到一九五七年全国已经有六十五个县、市分别达到了全国农业发展纲要修正草案所提出的每亩生产粮食四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的要求；已经有五十六个县、市分别达到了每亩生产棉花（皮棉）六十斤、八十斤、一百斤的要求，即提前十年完成了全国农业发展纲要修正草案所规定的任务。还听到目前全国每天有八千多万劳动力参加农田水利的建设，我预计一九五八年工业生产、农业生产都将掀起空前大高潮。
    国际形势：东风压倒西风  国内形势：新精神大跃进
    在这里愿举一两件最近见于报纸的但几乎使人难以想像的奇迹。一月十二日人民日报载：湖北均县一个合作社主任创造了引河水到山坡的经验，把旱田改为水田，当年改成了三十亩，亩产六百九十斤，风动了一时，光化县发展了均县的经验，襄阳专区地委推广了光化县的经验，对湖北全省起了极大的推动作用，现全省每天出工修水利工程的有五百五十万人以上。大型工程三百八十九处，中型十万八千九百多处，小型已完工的两万多处，这是一件。还有一件是：一月十一日光明日报和十二日大公报同样载：滇南红河哈尼族彝族自治州绵延几百里的国境上，有在原始森林里游猎为生的两千多人口的“苦聪人”，他们为反抗反动统治者而被迫进入大森林以后，几乎与世隔绝。解放后，自治州组织了苦聪人访问团，帮助他们改造生活。现在游猎变为定居，木棒自卫，进于铁质农具，单干进于互助，子弟在小学校学文化。
    一件又一件成千上万的每天发见于报纸上的惊人的新鲜事物，还不是有目共见吗！
    自然，世界大时代也正在到临，我在这里，庆贺又一个反殖民主义精神代表者阿拉伯统一共和国成立了；我在估计，东西方最高级会议尽管拖延召开，但消灭核武器战争运动终将获得胜利；有消息苏联又将有比第二个人造卫星重两倍的卫星上天了，这些给全世界爱好和平的人民多么大的鼓舞呢！
    我兴奋极了。请看！就国际形势讲，真是东风压倒西风；就国内讲，新中国民族精神，正在发扬蹈厉地跃进！大跃进！
    一部中国大历史，说得近些，三四千年的史料，我们大概知道些的吧！特别是几百年来，特别是我个人亲身接触到的八十年来，这些事实我脑海里不会丢掉了的吧！为什么解放到现在，只短短的八年零几个月，就会有今天这样惊人的、伟大的发展呢？真理摆在眼前，只要我们虚心地去钻研，一定能够发现。
    人类中间特别是劳动人民，他们有潜在着的丰富的力量和智慧，为什么过去不能充分发挥出来呢？问题就在于阶级压迫和剥削。他们被压迫、剥削到连自己物质生活的需求都不够维持的地步，更不可能接触到文化生活，这样捱过了几千百年。无产阶级先锋队中国共产党看清楚了这一点，就是劳动人民的伟大的潜在力量。在毛泽东选集“论联合政府”第一千一百二十页上边就指出这点，我个人在一九四五年去延安，访问毛主席，承招谈时，也向我指出过这一点。中国共产党看清楚了，就英明地大力地予以解放：解放了劳动人民的力量；还解放了劳动人民的智慧。解放了劳动人民的生产力；还解放了劳动人民的创造力。解放了，领导劳动人民走什么道路？走社会主义道路。我们必须认识：只有无产阶级来领导，领导全国人民走上社会主义道路，这样，才有可能消灭压迫和剥削。
    我们必须理解到眼前成千上万的惊人的新鲜事物，一切一切，都从这上边产生出来。
    现在一般人都在说“大势所趋，人心所向”。但我认为：如果真正认识这八个字，有两种人特别需要自觉地坚决接受改造。
    资产阶级知识分子必须改造  先明确为谁服务的政治立场
    一种人是：资产阶级的知识分子。这部分人过去自以为脑力劳动高于一切，实际上呢，四体不勤、五谷不分。因四体的不勤，连自己日常吃的饭都分不出种类，还自称知识分子、大知识分子，不丢丑么！最近有些人已在自觉地找寻出路。上海中学教师进修学院教员黄清士写信给我说“劳动锻炼这一课，对我这样的人是必需的。一切知识来自实践。离开实践就没有知识。我们不能称知识分子，只能称识字分子。”依我说来，连识字分子的头衔都受之有愧，文字还不是人民群众所创造的吗？——吴玉章主任报告就这样说。——文字所记载，那一种事物不是人民群众劳动的成果呢！识得这几个符号，就算了不起吗！特别是这些知识分子，大知识分子，大多数阶级的观念是模糊的，斗争的道理是不懂的。不快快改造，加紧锻炼，怎么能适合目前的新形势呢！
    怎样改造？结合了眼前整风的要求，就是要首先解决知识分子为谁服务的政治立场问题。必须要克服资产阶级的思想特别是资产阶级的个人主义。我们知道，走社会主义道路，在行李里，绝对不许携带这些资产阶级的旧思想的包袱。只有丢掉了资产阶级旧思想的包袱，去向工农群众学习：学习工农群众的劳动习惯；学习工农群众的集体工作；学习工农群众的规律生活；学习工农群众的忘我精神。把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来，成为工人阶级的知识分子，才能够轻松愉快地走上社会主义道路。
　　“大势所趋”是由于“人心所向”  资产阶级分子也要把“心”献出
    还有一种人，必须自觉地进行改造的是：资产阶级分子。一九五七年一般工商业者把生产资料完全交给国家，成为公私合营，这是大大地值得称道的。但大多数人的“心”并没有交给国家，会随时暴露出资产阶级思想。在整风中，某地方反映工商业者一句话：“长江大桥虽然好，可惜不能搬到家里来。”这可以说足够代表资产阶级的思想了。一九五七年十月我去上海向一万四千工商界群众讲话完毕，遇到了一个从前的工厂老板，我问：怎样？把企业交了出来，感觉怎样？他答一句：“这是大势所趋吧！”从这句话听来，虽然带几分勉强，但总算已经认识了“大势”，我希望这些朋友们如果能够进一步认识到“大势所趋”是通过“人心所向”的，是不可抗、也不应该抗的，那就好了。我认为：工商界只要一想到过去反动政府统治下受尽官僚资本压迫、勾结帝国主义侵略的种种痛苦的情况，今天把个人的利益和国家的、人民的利益结合起来，两两对比，就可以判断现在和过去、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的好、坏和优、劣了。而况新中国社会主义建设，正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展，还需要各种建设人才，工商界的朋友们只要大家能够积极参加一般整风，即通过一次集中的自我教育和自我改造的运动，从根本上改变自己的政治立场以后，把技术和经营管理的经验，连同自己的“心”一齐贡献出来，完全符合中华人民共和国宪法第十条“改造”的要求。这样做到了，这些就真正地成为“国家的财富”。
    总的说来，无论是资产阶级的知识分子或者是资产阶级分子，总是要首先改造政治立场，逐步成为自食其力的劳动者。
    愿向到会代表提出挑战竞赛  在伟大的运动中比一比干劲
    结合到我个人。我呢，八十岁了。但活下去，我现时在、以后还要在中国共产党领导下，认真接受改造，参加社会主义的建设工作。同时好好学习，向工人阶级学习，通过思想改造，努力学习掌握马克思主义的世界观。把从几十年资产阶级社会里生长出来、养大起来的我，彻底改造成为一个忠于社会主义的工人阶级的知识分子。我知道这个改造功夫是不容易的，但我一定要勉力做去，虚心地不断地自己找寻自己的缺点和错误。
    说来奇怪，自从我看到了、听到了目前国家在各方面的大跃进的情况后，就好像忽然年纪轻了许多。在我的心头，不但感到了春天的温暖，全身也出现了一股干劲。
    我是几十年来一向抱着革命乐观主义的。请允许我向今天到会的志愿参加的代表同志们提出挑战竞赛。在目前展开的一般整风运动中以及其他运动中大家比一下，谁的干劲大？
    代表同志们！这个时代太伟大了。我们生在这个时代太幸福了。让我们认识大时代，改造做新人，大家鼓起干劲，来建设社会主义新中国。
    最后，让我们大家对领导我们这个伟大国家前进的核心力量，高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
