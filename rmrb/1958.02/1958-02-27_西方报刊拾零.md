Western Press Clippings

    Daydreaming
    Toronto dispatch: Retired Air Vice-Marshal Plaunt said that the best way to defend against intercontinental missiles is to create a layer of sand in the sky. He said at a press conference, "When the missile flies through the sand curtain, it will burn itself out due to friction." "However, the problem is how to get the sand into the sky."

    New Trick for Racial Discrimination
    The Georgia State Senate recently passed a law prohibiting blood transfusions between different races. State Senator Sharman, who proposed the bill, said: "This is not a discriminatory law, but a preventive measure to maintain the dignity and purity of each race and prevent racial mixing." He said that sickle cell anemia is known to be unique to blacks, and there is currently no cure for this disease. He also quoted medical authorities to prove that this disease is also found in people with black ancestry.

    想入非非
    多伦多消息：已经退休了的空军副元帅普兰特说，防御洲际导弹最好的办法，就是在天空布上一层沙幕。他在一个记者招待会上说，“当导弹飞越沙幕时，将因发生摩擦而自行烧焚。”“不过，问题是如何才能使沙土上天。”

    种族歧视新猷
    乔治亚州州参议院最近通过一项禁止不同种族间输血的法令。提出这项法令的州参议员沙蒙说：“这不是一项歧视的法令，而是维持各种族的尊严和纯正的一项预防性措施，它可以防止种族混杂。”他说，已知唯独黑人患有一种镰状血球性贫血，这种病症目前尚无治疗方法，他并且引用医学权威的话来证明在有黑人血统的人身上也发现这种疾病。
