　　Planned Births and Cultural and Technical Knowledge to the Countryside
    Speech by Representative Ma Yinchu
    At the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress, I presented my "New Population Theory" with the aim of, on the one hand, controlling the unborn population, and on the other hand, raising the material and cultural living standards of the existing population. Today's speech is a continuation of the "New Population Theory" I proposed last time. I will only discuss the following two points: (1) Birth control; (2) Cultural and technical knowledge to the countryside.

    Over the past year, the Party and the government have done a lot of work in the area of birth control, and farmers have begun to gradually realize that birth control is in their own best interests.
    Regarding birth control, the Party and the government have already done a lot of work, both directly and indirectly, in the past year. By direct, I mean measures such as the cancellation of subsidies for military dependents with multiple children. By indirect, I mean measures such as the recent large-scale construction of farmland irrigation projects. From October of last year to the end of January of this year, the number of farmers working on water conservancy projects nationwide has increased from 20 to 30 million in October, 60 to 70 million in November, and then to about 100 million in January of this year. Based on an average of 120 working days per person, a total of 12 billion working days have been spent. With an average wage of 0.6 yuan per working day, the funds invested by farmers in water conservancy projects have reached 7.2 billion yuan. The number is still increasing, and the work is still in progress. Of course, the wealth created by these 7.2 billion yuan will greatly exceed this amount and is incalculable. This is a direct impact. If this money were not invested in production but remained in the hands of farmers, it would inevitably be used for food, clothing, weddings, funerals, superstitions, gambling, etc., which could easily lead to unplanned births. This is what I mean by indirect work. Representative Zhao Wenfu from Henan Province pointed out in his speech at this meeting that many young men and women voluntarily postponed their marriages in order to realize water conservancy. Representative Qiu Xinye from Liaoning Province also said in his speech that workers who planned to get married during the Spring Festival have written to their fiancées, postponing the wedding date. The speeches of these two representatives are sufficient to prove that I am not wrong. Therefore, I say that the Party and the government have done a lot of work, both directly and indirectly, in the past year regarding birth control. A foreign expert who studies population issues in Southeast Asian countries once spoke at a peace conference. Mr. Chen Hansheng introduced him to me, and he said to me: "The population problem in some countries is much more serious than yours, but the government is indifferent to it. I don't know how serious it will become in the future. Your advantage is that the Party and government leaders have noticed the importance of this issue. Otherwise, relying only on scholars' words and writings will have little effect. Congratulations on having such a Party and such a government." After listening to his words, I felt that he had said what I wanted to say in my heart. Not only have the Party and the government done a lot of work, but local and national people's representatives are also very concerned about this issue. At the Third Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress held on January 5th and 6th of this year, representatives proposed various measures to control population growth, such as vigorously promoting birth control and advocating late marriage, etc. At the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress, eight representatives, including Li Yong, proposed an amendment to the marriage age in the Marriage Law. The Motions Examination Committee of the Congress submitted this proposal to the Standing Committee to be studied by the Legal Affairs Committee. The Legal Affairs Committee believes that "the spirit of advocating late marriage is good and should be strengthened in propaganda and education among the masses so that the masses voluntarily postpone the age of marriage." Before the masses understand the harms of early marriage and the benefits of late marriage, the age of marriage can remain unchanged for now. It is said that laws cannot be implemented by themselves, so I think the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee is correct.

    The Party and the government have already started to work on this, and local and national people's representatives have also begun to study this issue. So how do the farmers themselves view this issue? This issue is already included in the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) as Article 29. This article stipulates: "Except for ethnic minority areas, in all densely populated areas, promote and popularize birth control, advocate planned childbirth, so that families avoid excessive living burdens, children receive better education, and have full employment opportunities." Since the promulgation of the Agricultural Development Program, a wide range of discussions and debates have been launched in rural areas, and the provisions of Article 29 have yielded considerable results. For example, the Shuangjing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, recently launched a major debate on birth control, and many members believe that they should have planned childbirth in the future. This debate was triggered during the discussion of the grain issue. The cooperative's grain production has increased year by year, but the grain consumption level of some members has not increased accordingly. Members found in the discussion that the population had increased too quickly. The whole cooperative added 52 people last year, needing to consume more than 31,000 jin of grain, requiring an average increase of 27 jin per mu to be able to eat. However, there is a prevailing custom of early marriage and multiple births here, and this issue has not attracted everyone's attention in the past. In recent years, with the improvement of living standards, this custom has developed even further, with many people believing that "early planting, early harvesting, and early birth of sons bring early happiness." The elderly encourage their children to marry early, and young people are eager to marry as soon as they reach the prescribed age. When the government promoted birth control, many people had ideological resistance. During the great airing of views, some people even raised objections, saying: "The government even wants to control how many children we have," expressing great dissatisfaction. Later, the cooperative specifically convened a debate on birth control, debating "whether birth control is good or not." The participants were very enthusiastic. Someone said: "With too many children, we can't take care of both food and clothing. Last year when I joined the cooperative, I received more than 400 jin of grain, but adding a child used it all up, and now I still owe more than 30 yuan. With too many children, the living standards can't be improved, and my wife and I have had many quarrels." At the meeting, everyone calculated the detailed accounts of population growth, and everyone was shocked when they finished the calculations. Everyone felt that if this continues, how much more grain will have to be produced each year to be enough to eat? How much surplus grain will there be to sell to the state to support industrial construction? Then, the entire room discussed the harms of having too many children. Someone who had given birth to six children said: "With too many children, I can't take care of production. Sometimes when I come back from work, the children have no one to take care of them and fall, breaking their heads and bleeding. Last year, I only did more than 200 work points, while people with fewer children did more than 1,000 work points." At the meeting, some people also criticized the idea of "early birth of sons brings early happiness," arguing that with the cooperative, hard work can improve living standards, and running the cooperative well is more reliable than anything else (meaning that it is not necessary to rely on sons). Everyone in the room felt that the government's promotion of birth control was precisely out of concern for their production and life. However, some members complained that contraception was troublesome. After debate, everyone felt that a little trouble was better than the big trouble caused by excessive births. Some members also suggested strengthening birth control propaganda in rural areas, improving the supply of contraceptives, and hoping that hospitals could come up with easier and more economical methods of contraception.

    Regarding the second point, "Cultural and technical knowledge to the countryside," I would like to put forward the following two opinions:

    Agricultural production experience is very rich. Summarizing the experiences created by the farmers themselves to educate the farmers is the best and fastest way to improve the cultural level of the farmers. This is the inescapable responsibility of the cadres sent to the countryside.

    (A) Educating farmers with the experiences created by the farmers themselves over thousands of years.

    This requires investigating and sorting out the extremely rich heritage of the motherland. At present, many young people in organs and other intellectuals who have the physical ability to work are actively responding to the Party's call to go to the countryside, go to the mountains, go to the workers and peasants, and thoroughly transform their thinking to become intellectuals with a firm working-class stance, that is, to become cultured laborers. I believe that taking advantage of the current upsurge of the rectification movement across the country, we can also begin to guide farmers to become cultured workers through labor. According to reports, some cadres sent to the countryside are unwilling to lag behind and are even competing with cooperative members in labor production. Some cadres sent to the countryside have become well-known throughout the cooperative and township soon after arriving because of their good labor. The farmers are also very concerned about their health, always reluctant to let them do heavy work, and advising everyone to rest more. At the same time, the farmers also hope that the cadres sent to the countryside will give them some mental labor, bring some culture and knowledge, help them with literacy work, study production technology, explain the Forty Articles, compile newsletters, sort out materials, and conduct investigations and research. Intellectuals, in addition to labor production, should of course also give play to their own expertise, combine it with their original business, and contribute their culture and knowledge. In this way, everyone will feel more useful, and naturally they will understand the joy and prospects of production work in rural areas. Only in this way can we truly improve relations with the masses and take root, blossom, and bear fruit among the masses. In this way, intellectuals will become cultured laborers, and the peasant masses can quickly become cultured workers, while gradually eliminating the boundaries between mental and physical labor.

    In order to improve the level of agricultural science, we must learn from foreign, especially Soviet, advanced agricultural science. However, agriculture is localized, and we should pay attention to the characteristics of our country. Throughout history, the working people of our country have accumulated very brilliant achievements and experience in the struggle for agricultural production. As early as the Warring States period, 2,200 years ago, the "Distinguishing Soils" chapter of "Lü's Spring and Autumn Annals" had already conducted relatively in-depth research on the sowing of crops. Unfortunately, most of the specialized agricultural books of the Warring States period have been lost, and only some fragments are preserved now. By the Han Dynasty, about 2,000 years ago, there were more than a dozen agricultural books, but all except the "Fan Shengzhi's Book" have been lost. Only part of the original text of "Fan Shengzhi's Book" is preserved. This book is a special book on a complete set of high-yield farmland technology, which Fan Shengzhi summarized and improved based on the experience of the masses. The cultivation methods it describes include many valuable experiences. The earliest complete agricultural book in China is "Essential Skills for the Common People." This was written by Jia Sixie, a great agricultural scientist in ancient China, in the 30s of the 6th century, about 1,420 years ago. "Essential Skills for the Common People" is more than 500 years later than "Fan Shengzhi's Book." In these more than 500 years, Chinese agriculture has made great progress, and "Essential Skills for the Common People" can summarize it more comprehensively.

    However, ancient agricultural books and medical books have great differences in the scope of writing. It is the working farmers who master and constantly improve agricultural technology, but they cannot write books, unlike doctors who can speak and write. Although the number of doctors is far less than that of farmers, they have written many medical books, and these medical books can be passed down from teachers to apprentices and continue to develop. Although ancient medical books are inevitably lost, they are relatively few. As for agricultural books, working farmers cannot write them themselves, so the task of writing agricultural books falls on a few people who study agriculture. Therefore, the number of general agricultural books is far less than that of medical books, and agricultural books cannot be passed down from teachers to apprentices to continue development. In addition, agricultural books are rarely valued by general literati and book collectors, and are particularly easy to lose. Not only agricultural books before the Han Dynasty have been lost, but also none of the important agricultural books of the Tang Dynasty have been preserved. Not only that, since the writers of agricultural books are not farmers themselves, the advanced experience that occurs at any time and place cannot be summarized and recorded by the farmers themselves. Some agricultural operations, although of great value, cannot be widely disseminated due to language barriers and traffic congestion, and do not attract the attention of literati. Therefore, only a small part of the valuable experience of farmers can be summarized and recorded, and most of it is passed down from generation to generation in the practice of farmers. I think that the intellectuals who go to the countryside today should widely and deeply investigate and study the experiences that have been passed down from generation to generation in the practice of farmers and the achievements they have made in practice. Mr. Wan Guoding, director of the China Agricultural Heritage Research Office, said: "There is no end to the advanced experience in the practice of farmers, but we often see it and do not think it is strange, but it is very valuable in the eyes of international friends. For example, in 1953, Academician Daskalov, director of the Institute of Plant Cultivation of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, came to China to inspect and saw that the well cellars in different climates and underground in various parts of China can keep sweet potatoes from spoiling for years. Various different well cellars have easy methods in terms of heat preservation and ventilation. He believes that this is a very valuable experience." "For example, he saw in Houmu Village Station in Dalian that farmers intercropped cabbage and leeks to prevent cabbage root rot, and believed that this was very in line with scientific principles. He introduced the research of Soviet scholar Tokin, which proved that onions, garlic, and other roots secrete a kind of plant bactericide, which has a bactericidal effect. Therefore, some international friends have suggested to us to sort out and summarize the agricultural experience of our country for thousands of years, and believe that this will definitely help the progress of international agricultural science." Therefore, summarizing and promoting our agricultural experience of thousands of years is particularly necessary when developing agriculture on a large scale today. This is a compulsory course to improve the cultural level of farmers. Speaking of this, I think of the talks of several cadres who went to the countryside in the newspapers. They said: Various vegetables have various different ways of tying them; when digging vegetable cellars, how exactly should they be dug? Where should the cellar eyes be dug? What direction? Farmers have a set of extremely rich experience. However, they are limited by culture and cannot summarize it well, and the Forty Articles clearly instruct us to "collect local high-yield experiences from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, compile them into books, and disseminate and promote them." Therefore, summarizing experience for farmers is the responsibility of intellectuals who go to the countryside, and it is also the best and fastest way to improve the cultural level of farmers. This is to educate farmers with the experiences created by the farmers themselves over thousands of years. Chairman Mao once said that "the elderly and the weak can not go to rural factories to exercise." He probably meant physical labor. Writing is a kind of mental labor, and the elderly and the weak intellectuals can also do it, and the speaker himself has such aspirations.

    The experience of Qin County in resolving the contradiction between industry and agriculture shows that we should attach importance to giving play to the enthusiasm of county-run industries, and the county should organize the strength of the local masses according to local conditions, so that local industries can better serve the rural economy.

    (B) Helping farmers march into nature.

    Speaking of today's scientifically backward China, it is very unrealistic to improve the scientific level in rural areas. But we can first disseminate the technical knowledge urgently needed in rural areas, and first improve the technical level. As for how to improve it, I think that the work done by Qin County in Shanxi Province in this regard is worth introducing and promoting. The matter is like this: The development of agricultural production urgently needs the support of industry, but the machinery and materials supplied by industry are very expensive, and the cooperatives cannot raise so much money. For example: (1) Large-scale and universal construction of farmland irrigation requires a level for surveying terrain, geological drilling is required for building river dams, and high-pressure water gates, sand flushing gates, gate lifting machines, fish nets, etc. are required on the reservoirs. These things are too expensive. A level costs more than 400 yuan, and it costs about 200 yuan to hire a drilling rig to drill one meter, and it is often impossible to get in line. High-pressure gates and gate lifting machines cost 1,000 or several thousand yuan, and agricultural cooperatives find it difficult to raise this money, and it is difficult to find a unit to undertake the construction even if they raise the money. (2) The chemical fertilizers needed by agricultural cooperatives are not only too small in quantity, but also too expensive. (3) The simple machines and new farm tools needed by agricultural cooperatives to save manpower and animal power, farmers will not install, use, or repair, and urgently need industrial assistance, but the factories are too far away, and there are too few people, and they cannot meet the needs of these many agricultural cooperatives. This shows that there is a great contradiction between industry and agriculture. But those who have studied dialectics believe that any contradiction contains factors to overcome the contradiction, so Qin County has found a way to solve this contradiction with this confidence.

    The level required for surveying terrain for water conservancy construction was manufactured by the Qin County United Processing Plant (local state-owned) based on the principle of the level, imitating the appearance of the level, using cheap materials such as scrap iron and glass that can be found locally. The level was designed with the help of a physics and chemistry teacher from Qin County Middle School, and the glass cylinder was directly installed by the laboratory of the middle school. The round iron cylinder and wooden frame were made by people from the iron industry cooperative and the wood industry cooperative. This simple level only costs 13 yuan, less than one-thirtieth of the price of a level from a large factory. Of course, it has some shortcomings. It cannot see very far, but it can be surveyed in several sections. The effect is still good, and several counties have purchased it from Qin County. As for the drilling rig, the United Processing Plant also used local materials to trial-produce a hand-cranked simple drilling rig, which can drill 10 meters deep in total. It can only drill one meter at a time, and take out this section to look at before drilling further, which of course increases the trouble, but it can also clarify the geological conditions within 10 meters. The drilling cost per meter is only 0.38 yuan, less than one-five-hundredth of the drilling price of a large drilling rig. Under the same policy, this factory self-made a four-ton high-pressure water gate and a gate lifting machine with the same capacity, and the price is only about half the price of products from large factories.

    The biggest difficulty in Qin County is that the government and agricultural cooperatives are short of money. To produce chemical fertilizers, produce various small machines and new farm tools, and open various small enterprises, such as power generation and flour milling stations, all require a certain amount of funding. Where does the money come from? Qin County solved this problem by means of joint ventures. There are three forms of joint ventures. Due to space limitations, I will only talk about one here. For the other two, please see the People's Daily on January 13th of this year. What I want to talk about is the joint venture between the factory and the agricultural cooperative to produce granular fertilizer with peat from the Kaicun area of Qin County. One jin can top one dan of farm fertilizer. If the entire investment is borne by the government, not only will there be no money to come from, but the cost will also be too high for farmers to afford. The joint venture between the factory and the agricultural cooperative solves this problem. The method is that the factory provides equipment, the agricultural cooperative provides labor, the fertilizer produced is directly distributed and used by each cooperative, and the sales problem is also solved. The original price of granular fertilizer was 0.074 yuan per jin, now it is only 0.039 yuan, and some cooperatives can simply exchange labor for fertilizer without spending any money at all.

    The factory in Qin County used to be a professional egg factory. It had nothing to do in winter, and it had to stop work for five months a year. Now this problem has also been solved. When winter comes, the egg factory stops, and everyone digs saltpeter soil, boils saltpeter, and makes brine (fertilizer); the oil pressing business is less in winter, and manpower can be turned to printing (there is an activity of changing account books at the end of the year, so the printing factory is busy). The contradiction between the continuity required by industrial production and the seasonality of the rural market has now been resolved due to the joint venture between the factory and the agricultural cooperative.

    Now I want to especially emphasize here that Qin County uses this processing plant as a technical school and technical consultant at the same time. Under the leadership of this factory-style school, each cooperative has organized more than 50 groups to produce brine. At the same time, it centrally trains workers for agricultural cooperatives, a term of several days. Other counties can also come to learn. Brine is a very good topdressing fertilizer in the minds of the people of Qin County. After watering and applying brine, the soil will become loose and ventilated, and better absorb and retain moisture. However, the factory's activities are not limited to within the factory. They also organize agricultural cooperatives in various places to produce brine, and provide technical guidance to the production of each cooperative. Each cooperative could only produce water but not lumps, and could not refine fire saltpeter. After the guidance of the factory's technicians, they also learned these two skills. The factory, as a county-run enterprise, also follows the instruction to "face the countryside" and is responsible for installing and repairing various agricultural machinery and new farm tools for agricultural cooperatives, and at the same time helping agricultural cooperatives train people to use machinery. Some have signed contracts for guaranteed teaching. In this way, the contradiction between industry and agriculture is resolved, the problem that agricultural cooperatives cannot afford new machinery is resolved, and the difficulties in installing, using, and repairing machinery are also overcome. At the same time, the technical knowledge of farmers is also widely disseminated. I believe that this method of joint venture between industry and agriculture may be an appropriate method for the vast rural areas to develop economy and culture within a certain period of time, and it is worth emulating in various places.

    The separation of industry and agriculture is not only the case in Shanxi, but also in other provinces. In the past, many agricultural cooperatives in the Xiangyang area bought double-wheel double-share plows, but they were all idle and unused, causing backlog. It was not because the double-wheel double-share plows were not good, but because the technical work did not keep up, the farmers were not taught how to use them, and appropriate repairs were not made according to local characteristics. Currently, the most important issue is to change the management system of local industries and give play to the enthusiasm of county-level business operations. For example, although a large part of the local industries in Hebei Province are located in the county, they are all under the leadership of the province or the special zone, and the county cannot manage them and cannot use its strength. Therefore, the provinces should now consider decentralizing local industries to the county level, developing county-run industries, and the county should organize the strength of the local masses according to local needs, so that local industries can better serve the rural economy according to local conditions.

专栏：

　　有计划地生育和文化技术下乡
    马寅初代表的发言
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上，我向大会提出“新人口论”，其目的，在一面控制尚未出生之人口，一面提高现有人口的物质和文化生活水平。今日的发言是上次提出的“新人口论”之继续。我只谈下列二点，就是：（一）节制生育；（二）文化技术下乡。
    一年以来，党和政府在节制生育方面作了不少工作，农民也开始逐步认识到节育是符合自己的切身利益的
    关于节制生育，党和政府在过去的一年中，直接地间接地已经做了不少工作。我所谓直接，是指取消军属多子女补助费一类措施而言。我所谓间接，是指最近热火朝天的兴修农田水利一类措施而言。从去年十月到今年一月底，全国每天在水利工程战线上从事劳动的农民，自十月份二、三千万，十一月份的六、七千万，又上升到今年一月份的一亿左右。按每人劳动一百二十天计算，共有一百二十亿个劳动日。以每个劳动日平均工资按六角计算，农民在水利工程上所投入的资金已有七十二亿元。现在人数还在增加，工作尚在进行。当然这七十二亿元所创造的财富当大大地超过此数，而且是无可估计的。这是直接的影响。这笔钱若不投入生产，而留在农民手中，不免用之于吃穿、婚丧、迷信、赌博等等，容易引起无计划的生育。这就是我所谓间接的工作。河南代表赵文甫先生在这次发言中指出，许多男女青年为了实现水利化，自愿推迟了结婚时间。辽宁省代表丘新野先生在发言中也说，打算在春节结婚的工人，纷纷给女方写信，推迟结婚期。这两位代表的发言，足以证明吾言之不误。所以我说关于节制生育一点，党和政府在过去一年中直接地或间接地已经做了不少工作。有一位研究东南亚国家人口问题的外国专家一日在和平大会讲演时由陈翰笙先生介绍他与我交谈，他对我说：“有的国家的人口问题比你们的严重得多，但政府对此漠不关心，不知将来要严重到什么程度。你们的优点，是党政领袖们已注意到这个问题的重要性，不然的话只靠学者们口说笔写效果很小。祝贺你们有这样的一个党和这样的一个政府。”我听了他的话之后，觉得他说出了我心中要说的话。不仅党和政府已经做了不少工作，即地方和全国的人民代表也很关心这个问题。在今年一月五日、六日举行的上海市第二届人民代表大会第三次会议上，代表们提出各种控制人口增长办法，如大力提倡节育提倡晚婚等等。全国人民代表大会第四次会议上有李永等八位代表提出修改婚姻法的结婚年龄案，大会提案审查委员会把这个提案交由常务委员会交法案委员会研究。法案委员会认为：“提倡晚婚的精神是好的，应当在群众中加强宣传教育，使群众自愿地推迟结婚年龄。”在群众不了解早婚的害处和迟婚的好处以前，结婚年龄现在可以不改。徒法不能以自行，自古云然，所以，我认为法案委员会的意见是正确的。
    党和政府已经着手做了，地方和全国人民代表也开始研究这个问题了，试问农民自己对这个问题如何看法？这个问题已经包含在农业发展纲要（修正草案）之中作为第二十九条。这条规定：“除了少数民族的地区以外，在一切人口稠密的地方，宣传和推广节制生育，提倡有计划地生育子女，使家庭避免过重的生活负担，使子女受到较好的教育，并且得到充分就业的机会。”自农业发展纲要颁布之后，在农村中已掀起了广泛的讨论和辩论，第二十九条的规定已取得了不少的收获。比如四川省内江县双井农业生产合作社最近就节制生育问题展开了大辩论，许多社员都认为今后应该有计划地生育子女。这次辩论是在讨论粮食问题时引起的。社里粮食年年增产，可是有些社员粮食消费水平却没有相应提高。社员在讨论中发现原来是人口增加太快，全社去年一年就增加五十二人，需要消费粮食三万一千多斤，要平均每亩多增产二十七斤才能够吃。但这里有早婚多生子的风气，这个问题过去并未引起大家注意。近几年，生活有了改善，这种风气更有了发展，许多人认为“早栽秧，早打谷，早生儿子早享福”。老年人鼓励儿女早婚，青年人也是刚满规定年龄就急忙结婚。政府宣传节制生育时，不少人思想有抵触。在大鸣大放中，有人还提出意见说：“政府连我们生多少娃娃也要管。”表示很不满意。后来这个社专门召开了节制生育问题的辩论会，辩论“节制生育到底好不好”。参加的人很踊跃。有人发言说：“娃娃多了，顾吃顾不到穿。前年入社，去年多分了四百多斤粮食，可是添个娃娃就用得精光，现在还欠三十多元债。娃娃多了，生活提不高，老婆和我吵过好多架。”在会上，大家都算起人口增加的细账来，算到后来都很吃惊。大家感到这样下去，一年要增产多少粮食才够吃？那还有多少余粮卖给国家支援工业建设？接着，全场你一句，我一句议论起孩子过多的害处来。生过六个孩子的一个人说：“娃娃一多，照顾娃娃就照顾不了生产。有时候做活回来，娃娃没人照应跌得头破血流。去年我只做二百多个工分，娃娃少的人却做了一千多个工分。”在会场上有些人还批评了“早生子早享福”的思想，理由是有了合作社，勤劳动就能改善生活，把合作社办好，比啥都可靠（意思就是不必一定要靠儿子）。全场的人都认为政府提倡节育正是关心他们的生产和生活。不过有些社员嫌避孕麻烦。经过争论，大家感到有点小麻烦，还是比生育过多带来大麻烦好。有些社员还建议在农村加强节育的宣传，改进避孕药物的供应工作；并希望医院能想出更简便更经济的避孕方法。
    关于第二点“文化和技术下乡”，特提出下列两点意见：
    农业生产经验非常丰富，总结这些农民自己创造的经验教育农民，是提高农民文化水平的最好最快的方法。这是下放干部义不容辞的责任。
    （甲）以农民几千年来自己创造的经验来教育农民
    这就需要调查整理祖国极其丰富的遗产。当前，凡具备体力劳动条件的机关青年和其他知识分子，很多积极响应党的号召，下乡、上山，到工农群众中去，到劳动中去，彻底改造自己的思想，成为具有坚定的工人阶级立场的知识分子，这就是说，做有文化的劳动者。鄙意以为乘这个全国范围的整风运动达到高潮的时候，也可以开始引导农民做有劳动的文化者。据报载有的下放干部不甘落后，在劳动生产上还和社员展开竞赛，有的下放干部刚来不久就以劳动好而在全社全乡知了名。在农民方面也很关心他们的健康，总不肯让他们干重活，劝大家多休息。同时农民却也希望下乡干部，给他们搞一些脑力劳动，拿出一些文化和知识来，帮助他们做些扫盲工作，研究生产技术，讲解四十条纲要，编写简报，整理材料和调查研究。在知识分子方面，除劳动生产外，当然也应该发挥自己的特长，结合自己原来的业务，贡献出自己的文化和知识。这样就可以使大家更感到大有用武之地，自然也就会了解到在农村中生产工作的乐趣和前途。只有这样才能真正搞好和群众的关系，才能在群众中生根、开花、结果。这样知识分子就成为有文化的劳动者，而农民群众也可以很快地成为有劳动的文化者，同时把脑力劳动和体力劳动间界线逐步消灭。
    为了提高农业科学水平，我们就要向外国的，特别是向苏联的先进农业科学学习。但是，农业是有地方性的，我们应该注意本国的特点。历代以来，我国劳动人民在农业生产斗争中，积累了非常辉煌的成就和经验。距今二千二百年前的战国时代，在“吕氏春秋”的“辨土篇”中，对于庄稼的播种，已经作了比较深刻的研究。可惜，战国时代的专门农书，多已失传，现在所保存者不过一些鳞爪而已。到了距今约二千年的汉朝，农书就有十几种之多，但除“泛胜之书”一书外，余皆失传。就是“泛胜之书”也只保存了一部分原文。此书是泛氏总结群众的经验而加以提高创造的一种成套的农田丰产技术专书，它所说的栽培法中，包括不少宝贵经验。我国现存最早的完整农书是“齐民要术”。这是我国古代伟大的农业科学家贾思勰在六世纪三十年代写成的，距今约一千四百二十多年。“齐民要术”后于“泛胜之书”五百多年，在这五百多年中，我国农业又有了很大的进步，“齐民要术”能比较全面地加以总结。
    但古代农书和医书比较，在写作范围上有很大的区别。掌握和不断改进农业技术的是劳动农民，但他们不能著书立说，不像医生那样能说能写。医生人数虽远不如农民之多，但他们写成很多医书，而且这些医书能够师徒相承，继续发展。虽古代医书亦不免有散失，但比较起来，还是少数。至于农书，劳动农民既不能自己动笔，写成农书的任务就落在少数研究农业的人身上。因此一般农书其数量远不及医书之多，何况农书又无师徒相传而得继续发展。此外，农书很少受到一般文人和藏书家的重视，尤易失传。不但汉以前的农书失传，唐朝几种重要农书也都没有一种保存下来。不特此也，农书的写作者既不是农民自己，则随时随地发生的先进经验亦不能由农民自己总结记录下来。有些农业操作，虽有重要价值，但因语言隔阂，交通阻塞，传播不广，引不起文人的注意。因此农民的宝贵经验，能被总结而记录下来的，只是一小部分，而大部分只是世代流传在农民的实践中。我认为今日下乡的知识分子应广泛而深入地调查研究那些世代相传在农民实践中的经验和在实践中所获得的成就。中国农业遗产研究室主任万国鼎先生说：“农民实践中的先进经验是说不尽的，但是我们往往习见而不以为奇，而在国际友人看来却很宝贵。例如一九五三年保加利亚科学院植物栽培研究所所长达斯卡洛夫院士来我国考察，看到我国各地不同气候和地下的井窖贮藏，可使甘薯保持经年不坏。各种不同的井窖在保温通风等方面，都有轻而易举的方法。他认为这是十分可贵的经验”。“又如他在大连后牧村驿看到农民把白菜和韭菜间作防止白菜根腐病，认为这很合乎科学原理。他介绍苏联学者托金的研究，证明洋葱、蒜等根部分泌一种植物杀菌素，有杀菌作用。因此有些国际友人向我们建议，整理总结我国几千年来的农业经验，并且认为，这样必将有助于国际农业科学的进步”。因此总结和推广我们几千年来的农业经验，就今日大规模地发展农业的时候来讲，殊有必要。这是提高农民文化水平的必修之课。说到这里，我想起几位下乡干部在报上的谈话。他们说：各种菜蔬有各种不同的捆法；挖菜窖时，究竟如何挖法？窖眼该挖在什么地方？什么方向？农民都有一套极其丰富的经验。但是，他们限于文化，不能很好地总结，而四十条纲要中明白指示我们“由各省、市、自治区收集当地的丰产经验，编印成书，传播推广”。所以为农民总结经验，是下乡知识分子的分内事，也是提高农民文化水平的最好最快的方法。这就是以农民几千年来自己创造的经验来教育农民。毛主席曾说过“年老体弱的可以不去农村工厂锻炼”。他大概是指体力劳动而言。写作是一种脑力劳动，年老体弱的知识分子亦可以做，发言人自己就抱有这样的志愿。
    沁县解决工农业矛盾的经验说明，应该重视发挥县营工业的积极性，由县因地制宜组织当地群众的力量，使地方工业更好地为农村经济服务。
    （乙）帮助农民向大自然进军
    就今日科学落后的中国来谈，提高农村中的科学水平是很不现实的。但我们可以先传播在农村中急迫需要的技术知识，并先提高技术水平。至于如何提高，我认为山西沁县在这方面所做的工作值得介绍和推广。事情是这样：农业生产的发展急切需要工业的支援，但工业所供应的机械和物资非常昂贵，合作社无法筹措这么多钱。比如说：（一）大规模地普遍兴修农田水利，需要勘测地势的水平仪，筑拦河坝需要地质钻探，水库上需要高压水闸、冲沙闸、起闸机、拦鱼网等等。这些东西价格太高，一个水平仪要四百多元，请钻探机来钻一公尺要二百元左右，而且经常排不上队。高压闸和起闸机等都要一千几百元，农业社很难筹到这笔钱，筹到钱也很难找到承制的单位。（二）农业社所需要的化学肥料不仅数量太少，而且价钱也太贵。（三）农业社为节省人力、畜力所需要的简单机械和新式农具，农民既不会安装，亦不会使用，坏了亦不会修理，急需工业方面来援助，但工厂离得太远，人也少，无法满足这许多农业社的需要。这说明了工业和农业之间存在着很大的矛盾。但学过辩证法的人相信在任何矛盾中包含着克服矛盾的因素，因此沁县本此信心找到了解决这个矛盾的途径。
    兴修水利钻探地势所需要的水平仪，由沁县联合加工厂（地方国营）根据水平仪的原理，仿效水平仪的模样，用当地能够找到的废铁玻璃等便宜材料，制造了一种简易水平仪，水平仪是由沁县中学校一位理化教员帮助设计的，并且由中学的化验室直接装置了玻璃圆筒。圆铁筒和木架子则是由铁业合作社和木业合作社的人们制造的。这个简易水平仪一部只化十三元，不及大工厂水平仪价格的三十分之一。它当然有些缺点，它不能看得很远，但可以多分几段来勘测，功效尚好，若干县份已经向沁县购买。至于钻探机，联合加工厂也是用当地材料，试制了一种手摇的简单钻探机，一共能钻十公尺深，一次只能钻一公尺，拿出这一截来，看了再往下钻，当然增加了麻烦，但也能搞清楚十公尺内的地质情况，每一公尺的钻探费不过三角八分，不及大钻机钻价的五百分之一。在同一方针下，这个厂自制了四吨重的高压水闸及同样能力的起闸机，价格只及大工厂产品价格的一半左右。
    沁县最大的困难是政府和农业社都缺钱，要生产化学肥料，生产各种小型机械和新农具，开办各种小型企业，如发电、磨粉等站，都需要一定数量的经费。钱从何来？沁县以合营的办法解决了这个问题，合营的形式有三种：因限于篇幅，我在这里只谈一种，其余二种请看今年一月十三日的人民日报，我要谈的就是工厂和农业社合营，用沁县开村一带的泥炭，生产颗粒肥料，一斤能顶一担农家肥料。如全部投资由政府负担，不仅款无从出，且成本亦太高，农民买不起。工厂与农业社合营，就把这个问题解决了。办法是工厂提供设备，农业社提供劳力，生产出来的肥料由各社直接分配使用，推销问题也连带解决了。颗粒肥料原来一斤的价格是七分四，现在只有三分九，有的社还可以根本不花钱，干脆用劳力换肥料。
    沁县的工厂过去是个专业的蛋厂，冬天无蛋就无事，一年要停工五个月。现在这问题也解决了。冬天到来，蛋厂停了，大家就来挖硝土，熬硝，做卤水（肥料）；冬天榨油的业务较少，人力就可以转向印刷（年终有换账簿的活动，所以印刷厂忙）。工业生产所要求的连续性和农村市场的季节性之间原来有矛盾，现在因工厂与农业社合营而解决了。
    现在我要在这里特别着重指出的，就是沁县把这个加工厂同时当作技术学校和技术顾问来使用，在这个工厂式的学校带动下，各社已经组织了五十多个小组生产卤水。同时为农业社集中训练工人，若干天一期，外县也可以来学。卤水是沁县人们心目中一种很好的追肥，浇了水再上了卤，就会使土壤松软透风，更好地吸收和保持水分。但工厂的活动不限于在工厂以内，他们也组织各地农业社生产卤水，对各社的生产予以技术指导。各社原来只能生产水而不能产块，也不能提炼火硝，经过工厂技术人员的指导，这两样技能也都学会了。工厂本县营企业必须“面向农村”的指示，还负责为农业社安装和修理各种农业机械和新农具，同时帮助农业社训练使用机械的人，有的订有包教包学的合同。这样工农业间的矛盾解决了，农业社买不起新机械的问题解决了，安装、使用和修理机械的困难也克服了。同时，农民的技术知识也普遍地传播开来了。我认为这个工农业合营的办法在一定的时期内，可能是广大农村发展经济和文化的一种适当办法，值得各地仿效。
    工业与农业脱节，不仅在山西如此，在其他各省，亦有同样的情形。过去襄阳专区许多农业社买了双轮双铧犁，都闲置着没有用，造成积压，并不是因为双轮双铧犁不好，而是因为技术工作没有跟上去，没有教会农民使用，没有根据地方的特点作适当的修理。当前一个最重大的问题是改变地方工业的管理体制，发挥县一级经营工作的积极性。比如河北省的地方工业，虽然很大一部分都设在县里，但都属省或专区一级领导，县里管不着，有劲使不上。因此现在各省应考虑把地方工业下放到县的问题，发展县营工业，由县里根据当地的需要，组织当地群众的力量，使地方工业更好地因地制宜地为农村经济服务。
