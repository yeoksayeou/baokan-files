Chinese Goods in the Soviet Union
By Our Correspondent Dai Feng

On one side of Red Square in Moscow, facing the Kremlin walls, stands a grand building. Guests from all over the world and visitors from all over the Soviet Union make sure to patronize it. This is the Moscow State Department Store, the largest in the Soviet Union, serving an average of 250,000 customers daily. On any given day, the spacious halls under the store's arched glass ceiling are teeming with people.

In recent years, under the principle of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance, the economic cooperation among socialist countries has been continuously developing and strengthening. Therefore, in this store, one can see "Bata" leather shoes from Czechoslovakia, canned fruits from Bulgaria, children's toys from East Germany, and silks, woolens, and embroidery from China. The richness and diversity of goods symbolize the increasing strength, prosperity, solidarity, and friendship of socialist countries.

A few days ago, at eight o'clock in the morning, just as the store opened, I followed the massive flow of people into the department store. In the spacious corridor of the first hall, many women quickly formed a long line. The line was very long, seemingly hundreds of people. What were they buying? It aroused my curiosity.

I followed the queue all the way to the second floor and discovered that everyone was eagerly buying headscarves made in China.

This is not an isolated phenomenon. A long line of customers was also present at the women's overcoat section on the second floor. Behind the counter of the women's overcoat section were rows of neatly arranged wooden racks, covered with various styles of overcoats. The first row of racks displayed dozens of light gray and beige-colored spring women's coats made of gabardine. The Russian word "Friendship" was embroidered on the collars of all of them. These are spring women's overcoats produced in our country.

In the women's overcoat section, I met the deputy director, Dagyana Batonovskaya. As soon as she saw me, she smiled happily and said, "You can see for yourself how much the Soviet people love your coats!"

She told me that this women's overcoat section had received two batches of Chinese women's spring coats in January. The first batch of 400 pieces arrived on January 28th and sold out early in the morning. The second batch of 600 coats arrived on January 31st, but more than 100 pieces had already been sold in less than an hour.

Dagyana said, while checking the ledger, "Your goods always sell well every time they arrive. This time they are selling even faster because these dolman-sleeved, straight-cut coats are novel in style and finely crafted."

The director, Yefimova, who had just come from the shipping counter, added, "The sizes of this batch of coats are also very suitable. Look, no customer who comes in leaves empty-handed. The only complaint from the customers is that there are too few goods..."

Walking into the fragrant cosmetics section, I saw Chinese Xinhua and Green Leaf soaps, sandalwood soaps, and the famous Soviet Kalman soaps placed together. In a glass cabinet were Chinese toothbrushes with a Temple of Heaven design printed on the boxes. The female salesperson told me that the sale of Chinese soap had only started in the last few days, but it had already received universal praise from customers.

Chinese silk fabrics, woolens, embroidered quilt covers, high-quality women's leather shoes, suitcases, women's handbags, sandalwood fans, handicrafts... these have long been familiar and liked by the Soviet people. In the State Department Store, just like in other stores in Moscow, Chinese goods can be seen everywhere. Today, a new batch of "Friendship" brand men's shirts has arrived. I saw many people buying these shirts in the men's clothing section. I also made a special trip to the cultural goods section to see if there were any Chinese products. I didn't find a single Chinese item, but I happened to hear a customer run up and ask if there were any Chinese fountain pens. The female salesperson replied that they were sold out.

Two days later, I visited the female manager of the State Department Store, Kalisova.

Kalisova said that the State Department Store began selling Chinese goods in 1954. Initially, there were few varieties and small quantities, mostly silk fabrics and handicrafts. In the past two years, the State Department Store has been selling more and more Chinese goods. For example, sales in 1957 increased by 40% compared to 1956. Currently, Chinese goods range from silks, woolens, overcoats, and leather shoes to leather cases for combs; everything is available. In 1957, the total sales of Chinese goods in the State Department Store reached 148 million rubles. Chinese goods sold in the State Department Store account for approximately 25% of the store's total foreign imports. This year's sales plan is even larger, and the variety of goods will also increase.

I asked the manager about the customers' opinions on Chinese goods. The manager said, "The fact that more and more customers are vying to buy Chinese goods shows that Chinese goods are excellent in all respects. However, there are also some criticisms. For example, one time we received a batch of women's sweaters, and the colors were almost all dark, and the knitting style was the outdated raglan style. The popular style is brightly colored dolman-sleeved sweaters. Therefore, it affected sales. Also, your women's silk shirts, sweaters, and overcoats sometimes have almost the same styles and colors; when women wear them and walk down the street, they look like real sisters." Kalisova laughed as she said this.

This reminded me that, due to the increasing living standards of the Soviet people, women are particular about what they wear. Whether it's the hats they wear or the dresses they wear, they are rarely the same.

Kalisova added, "I say that your handicrafts, women's outerwear, or handbags are often monotonous. Please don't think I'm complaining; it's just because the Soviet people's lives are flourishing, and they demand more, better, more satisfactory, and more varied goods." (Attached picture)

### 中国商品在苏联

    中国商品在苏联
    本报记者　戴枫
    在莫斯科红场一边，对着克里姆林宫围墙，有一座规模宏大的建筑物。来到莫斯科的世界各国的客人和来自苏联各地的客人们总要到这里光顾一番。这是苏联最大的、每天平均要接待二十五万顾客的莫斯科国家百货商店。不论哪一天，商店拱形玻璃顶棚下的宽敞大厅总是人山人海。
    近年来，在平等互利互相支援的原则下，社会主义阵营各国的经济合作在不断地发展、巩固。因此，在这个商店里能看到捷克斯洛伐克的“拔佳”皮鞋、保加利亚的水果罐头、民主德国的儿童玩具、中国的绸缎、呢绒、刺绣……。商品的丰富多样，象征着社会主义各国日益强盛、繁荣、团结和友好。
    前几天，在清晨八时商店刚开门的时候，我随着人的巨流进入了这个百货商店。在第一大厅宽敞的走廊里，许多妇女迅速地排成了长长的行列。这个行列长得很，看起来有好几百人。是在买什么东西呢？它引起了我的好奇。
    我顺着这个队伍一直走到二楼上，发现大家争着购买的东西，原来是我国出品的头巾。
    这并不是个别的现象，二楼上女大衣部也同样排着很长的一队顾客。女大衣部柜台后面是一排排整齐的木制衣架，上面挂满了各式大衣。第一排衣架上挂着的是几十件浅灰色、米黄色的华达呢春季女大衣。领口上一律绣着俄文字样“友谊”。这是我国出产的春季女大衣。
    在女大衣部，我会见了副主任达吉雅娜·巴托诺夫斯卡娅。她一见我，便高兴地笑着说：“你亲眼看到了，苏联人是多么喜欢你们的大衣啊！”
    她告诉我说，今年1月份，这个女大衣部一共收到了两批中国女式春大衣。1月28日第一批运来四百件，一清早就售光了。1月31日，运来第二批六百件大衣，但不到一小时，就已出售了一百多件。
    达吉雅娜一边查看账本，一边说，“你们来的货每次销路都好。这次销得更快，因为这批溜肩直筒式的大衣，样子新颖，做工精细”。
    刚从发货柜台上走过来的主任叶菲莫娃接过来说：“这批大衣的尺寸也都很合适。你看，进门的顾客，没有一个空着手出门的。顾客们唯一的意见就是货来得太少……”
    走进香气扑鼻的化妆品部，我看见了中国的新华、绿叶香皂、檀香皂和苏联名贵的卡尔曼香皂放在一起。有一个玻璃柜里放着纸盒上印有天坛图案的中国牙刷。女售货员告诉我，销售中国香皂还是最近几天内的事，但它已受到顾客们的普遍赞美。
    中国出品的绸缎、呢绒、绣花被面、高级女皮鞋、手提箱、女用手提包、檀香扇子、手工艺品……这些早就被苏联人熟悉而喜欢了。在国家百货商店，正像莫斯科其他商店一样，中国商品随处可见。今天，这里又新到了一批“友谊”牌男式衬衣。我在男子服装部看到许多人在购买这种衬衣。我还特地到文化用品部去看了一下有没有中国商品。我没有发现一件中国货，但碰巧听到一个顾客跑来问：有没有中国钢笔。女售货员回答说，卖完了。
    两天以后，我访问了国家百货商店的女经理卡莉苏娃。
    卡莉苏娃说，国家百货公司销售中国商品是在1954年开始的，初期品种少，数量也不多，大部分是绸缎衣料和手工艺品。这两年，国家百货商店销售的中国商品越来越多。例如1957年比1956年的销售量就增加了40％。目前中国商品从绸缎、呢绒、大衣、皮鞋，一直到装梳子的皮套，样样俱全。1957年全年国家百货商店销售中国商品的总数达一亿四千八百万卢布。国家百货商店销售的中国商品已占该商店外国进口商品总额的25％左右。今年的销售计划还要更大，货物种类也要增加。
    我向这位经理询问顾客们对中国商品的意见。经理说，“顾客们越来越多地争购中国商品，这一事实说明中国商品从各方面说来都是优良的。但是也有些批评意见。例如，有一次收到一批女毛衣，颜色几乎一律是深色的，编织式样是早过时了的插肩式。而流行的式样是颜色鲜艳的溜肩式毛衣。因此，影响了销路。还有，你们的女绸衬衣、毛衣、大衣，有时式样和颜色差不多是一样的，妇女们穿起来走到街上，活像亲姊妹。”卡莉苏娃说到这儿笑了。
    这使我想起，由于苏联人民生活水平的日益提高，妇女们穿戴得讲究。她们无论戴的帽子或穿的连裙衫，都很少是相同的。
    卡莉苏娃又说，“我说你们的手工艺品、女外衣或手提包常常是千篇一律。请你不要以为我是在埋怨，只是因为苏联人民生活蒸蒸日上，他们要求有更多、更好、更称心的、花色各式各样的商品。”（附图片）
