    Remembering Kobayashi Takiji
    -- Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of His Death by Lou Shiyi
    Twenty-five years ago today, around noon on February 20, 1933, in a quiet alley in Akasaka, Tokyo, Japan, Kobayashi Takiji and another young Japanese poet, Imamura Tsuneo, were making street contacts for the Communist Youth League when they were suddenly surrounded by a group of special agents who had been hiding nearby. After a fierce struggle, they were finally arrested and taken to the Tsukiji police station. In the interrogation room of the police station, Kobayashi Takiji knew that there was no escape, so he turned his head proudly and said to Imamura, who had been arrested at the same time, "Now, there is no other way, let's all hold on firmly." The special agents stripped him naked in the severe cold, punched him, kicked him, and tied him up with ropes, hanging him from the roof beams. He treated the enemy's cruel torture with silence, enduring three hours of inhuman torment. Finally, he was sent to the detention center, where a large amount of blood flowed from his anus and urethra. He said to the fellow prisoners around him, "Please tell my mother about my situation." He died around seven o'clock that evening, heroically sacrificing himself in the white terror of Japanese fascist rule.
    Kobayashi Takiji was the most outstanding proletarian writer in Japan, an excellent son of the Japanese people, and at the same time, a close friend of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement and the Chinese revolutionary literary movement. In April 1930, when his most famous novel, "Kanikosen" (Crab Cannery Ship), was first translated into Chinese, he wrote in the preface to the Chinese translation:
    "The heroic rise of the Chinese proletariat is such a great encouragement to the Japanese proletariat, their close neighbors! -- Now, my 'Kanikosen,' thanks to the admirable efforts of Comrade ××, can be read by the heroic Chinese proletariat, which makes me feel extremely excited. The facts written in this work may be relatively unfamiliar to the Chinese proletariat, but can't the extremely tragic, primitive exploitation and prisoner-like labor of the crab cannery ship be connected with the lives of the Chinese proletariat who are forced to work like animals under the iron chains of various imperialisms? Yes, it can be connected! Then I believe that my crude work, although very crude, can certainly become a force!..."
    Yes, just as many excellent international revolutionary literary works have given great strength to our long and arduous people's revolutionary struggle, we cannot forget the friends of the Japanese revolutionary literary movement, especially the strength given to us by outstanding writers like Kobayashi Takiji!
    When the news of Kobayashi Takiji's sacrifice aroused great anger among progressive revolutionary intellectuals and the broad masses of working people in Japan and internationally, Mr. Lu Xun once wrote a condolence telegram on behalf of Chinese left-wing writers and working people:
    "The people of Japan and China are brothers, and the bourgeoisie have drawn a line between us with the blood of the people, and are still drawing it now. But the proletariat and its pioneers are washing away this line with blood. The death of Comrade Kobayashi Takiji is the best proof. We know that we will not forget, and we will resolutely follow Comrade Kobayashi's path of blood, hand in hand."
    The people of China and Japan have faithfully fulfilled Mr. Lu Xun's oath and have advanced hand in hand together. Even during the most brutal years of the Anti-Japanese War, when the Japanese imperialist army burned and plundered the land of China, and the Chinese people fought a bloody and bitter struggle against the invading enemy, the hearts of the two peoples were always connected with each other due to the boundary washed away by the blood of pioneers like Kobayashi Takiji.
    Twenty-five years is only a short moment in human history, but the leaps and bounds of the era are so great. Japanese imperialism, which invaded China and murdered Kobayashi Takiji, has completely collapsed, while Kobayashi Takiji is deeply rooted in the hearts of the broad masses of Japanese working people. This is another good proof that no matter how powerful the reactionary forces are, they will eventually be eliminated, and the efforts of heroes who are connected with the people by flesh and blood are eternally immortal. Kobayashi's heroic blood flows in the veins of the Japanese people, making them feel infinite encouragement, and has played a huge role in the struggle to win democracy and independence, defend peace, oppose American military bases, oppose hydrogen and atomic weapons, and strive to establish diplomatic relations with China. The heroic Chinese people, who once made Kobayashi Takiji extremely excited, in the brilliant victory of the democratic revolution and the great leap forward towards socialism today, cannot but more deeply remember Comrade Kobayashi Takiji, who heroically sacrificed himself twenty-five years ago for the victory of the Japanese people's revolution against Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. His blood also flows in our veins, burning our hearts. The cause of the Japanese people to which he dedicated himself will be victorious, and the classic works of Japanese revolutionary literature that he left behind will also always educate us. This talented revolutionary writer, as early as the 1930s, pointed out in his works the path of tempering and transforming intellectuals ("March 15, 1928"), the path from primitive spontaneous struggle to collective organized struggle led by the Party ("Kanikosen"), and that the individual's life should simultaneously be the life of the class ("Party Life"). -- These themes are still close and realistic to us today.

    追忆小林多喜二
    ——纪念他逝世二十五周年　楼适夷
    二十五年前的今天，1933年2月20日刚过中午的时候，在日本东京赤坂巨的一条静僻的胡同里，小林多喜二和另一位日本的青年诗人今村恒夫，正为共青团的工作进行街头联系，突然被一群预先隐蔽在附近的特务包围起来了，经过剧烈的格斗之后，终于被逮住送到筑地的警察局。在警察局的刑讯室里，小林多喜二知道再也没法脱逃了，便昂然地回过头去对同时被捕的今村说：“现在，没有别的办法了，大家坚强地顶住吧。”特务们在严寒中脱光了他的衣服，用拳打，用脚踢，用绳子把他捆起来吊到屋梁上。他用沉默对待敌人的残酷的刑讯，经历了先后三小时的惨无人性的折磨，最后被送到拘留所里，从他的肛门和尿道口流出了大量的血来。他对身边的难友说：“请把我的情况告诉我的母亲。”就在这天晚上的七时左右，他死了，在日本法西斯统治的白色恐怖中，英雄般地牺牲了。
    小林多喜二是日本最优秀的无产阶级作家，是日本人民的优秀的儿子，同时，他也是中国人民革命运动中，中国革命文学运动中的亲密的朋友。1930年4月，当他的一部最著名的小说“蟹工船”第一次被译成中文的时候，他给中译本写的序文中说：
    “中国无产阶级的英雄般的奋起，对亲邻的日本无产阶级，是多么巨大的鼓舞的力量呀。——现在，我的“蟹工船”以××同志的可敬的努力，能够被英勇的中国无产阶级阅读，实使我感到异常的兴奋。在这个作品中所写的事实，也许对中国的无产阶级是比较陌生的，但是蟹工船的极其悲惨的原始式的剥削和囚犯似的劳动，难道不能和在各帝国主义的铁链下，被动物一般强制劳动的中国无产阶级的生活，联系起来看么？是的，这是可以联系起来的！那末，我相信：我这个粗浅的作品，虽然非常粗浅，也一定可以成为一种力量！……”
    是的，正如国际间许多优秀的革命文学作品，对我们长期艰苦的人民革命斗争给了很大的力量一样，我们不能忘记日本革命文学运动的朋友们，特别是像小林多喜二那样卓越的作家所给我们的力量！
    当小林多喜二牺牲的消息，在日本和国际进步的革命的知识分子和广大劳动人民之间激起巨大的愤怒的时候，鲁迅先生曾经代表中国的左翼作家和劳动人民写去一个唁电：
    “日本和中国的人民是兄弟，资产阶级用人民的血在我们之间划了界线，而且现在还在划着。但是无产阶级和它的先驱者却用血来洗去这种界线。小林多喜二同志的死就是最好的证据。我们知道，我们不会忘记，我们将坚决地踏着小林同志的血路，携手前进。”
    中国和日本的人民，是忠实地履行了鲁迅先生的誓言而共同携手前进的，即使是在抗日战争的最残酷的岁月里，当日本帝国主义的军队漫山遍野地焚掠中国的土地，中国人民对侵占的敌人喋血苦战的时候，由于像小林多喜二这样先烈的血所洗去的界线，两国人民的心也始终是互相交通的。
    二十五年在人类历史中只是短短的一刹那，而时代的跃进可是多么巨大呀。侵略中国和虐杀小林多喜二的日本帝国主义已经彻底崩溃了，而小林多喜二则深深地留在日本广大劳动人民的心里。这又是一个很好的证据，反动势力无论多么强大最后必然被消灭，而与人民血肉相结合的英雄们的努力，则是永远不朽的。小林的英雄的血流在日本人民的血管里，使他们感到无限的振奋，在争取民主、独立，保卫和平，反对美国军事基地，反对氢武器和原子武器，以及在争取与中国建立邦交的斗争中，发挥了巨大的勇气和力量。曾经使小林多喜二异常兴奋的英雄的中国人民，在获得民主革命的辉煌胜利，向社会主义大步跃进的今天，也不能不更深刻地追忆二十五年前为反对日本帝国主义侵略中国、争取日本人民革命的胜利而英勇牺牲的小林多喜二同志，他的血也同样流在我们的血管里，燃烧着我们的心，他所献身的日本人民的事业将得到胜利，他所遗留下来的作品——日本革命文学的经典著作，也将永远教育我们。这位天才的革命作家，远在三十年代已经在自己的作品中，指出了知识分子的锻炼和改造的道路（“1928年3月15日”），指出了从原始自发斗争到党所领导的集体组织斗争的道路（“蟹工船”），以及个人的生活应该同时是阶级的生活（“党生活者”）。——这些主题对于今天的我们，也是亲切而现实的。（附图片）
