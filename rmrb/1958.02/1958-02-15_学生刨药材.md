    Students Dig Up Medicinal Herbs
    In order to better fulfill the task of medicinal herb purchasing, ensure the health of people and livestock, and support agricultural harvests, the Shouyang County Medicinal Herb Company of Shanxi Province mobilized primary and secondary school students to collect and dig up medicinal herbs during the holidays. Combining this with sample exhibitions, more than 1,100 students gained basic knowledge of identifying medicinal herbs. For example, Wu Zhenhu and Wang Quancheng, students from Gouxi Primary School, brought back a bundle of wolfsbane on the same afternoon after looking at the samples. Students in a class at Zong'ai Junior High School dug up more than twenty catties of wild rehmannia in a short time. Local Fuhua, Kudingcha, and mountain peach kernels, which were rarely seen in the past, are now being collected in large quantities. In Dongguzhuang Village, Taigu County, a student named Shi Wade earned eighteen yuan in half a year by collecting and digging up medicinal herbs while going to school at the kiln head and on Sundays.

    学生刨药材
    山西省寿阳县药材公司为了更好地完成药材收购任务，以保证人、畜健康，支援农业丰收。利用假期。发动中小学生采刨药材，并结合样品展览使一千一百多名学生获得了识别药材的起码常识。如沟西小学学生吴振虎、王全成看了样品，当日下午就捧来了一捆狼毒，宗艾初中班学生不多时刨了野生地二十余斤；当地伏花、苦丁香、山桃仁等药材已往少见，现在也收了很多。太谷县东固庄有个学生名叫石娃德，利用到窑子头上学以及星期日采刨药材，半年中收入十八元。
