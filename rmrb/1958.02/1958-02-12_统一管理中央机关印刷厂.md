    Unified Management of Central Government Printing Plants
    Has the question of unified management of central government printing plants been considered? It has been brewing for a long time. I am a worker in a government printing plant, and I believe that unified management is better than decentralized management.
    In recent years, central government printing plants have developed rapidly. To date, there are probably forty or fifty of them, under the leadership of Party, government, and military administrative departments and publishing houses. The rapid development is due to two reasons: one is that government printing tasks are increasing year by year, but more importantly, it is due to decentralized leadership. Each unit only establishes or expands printing plants according to its own tasks, without considering, and being unable to consider, the printing capacity in society. This has resulted in: some printing plants not having enough tasks and frequently stopping work; others working overtime and blindly expanding; and units without printing plants still planning to set up plants. The result of each doing its own thing is a waste of national construction funds. In addition, the profits and depreciation fees obtained by the printing plants are not turned over to the state but are disposed of by each unit itself, which also easily leads to waste. If these printing plants were under unified management, the state would not need to invest in building more printing plants, and it could also reduce investment in state-owned printing plants and local state-owned printing plants. Each printing plant would also not need to spend tens of thousands of yuan to set up its own photography, copper mold, repair, and other auxiliary workshops. The state could assign tasks to the printing plants and stipulate the methods for turning over profits and depreciation fees. It could have several million yuan in income each year and also reduce a large number of administrative management personnel.

### 统一管理中央机关印刷厂

    统一管理中央机关印刷厂
    中央机关印刷厂能不能统一管理？这个问题已酝酿很久了。我是一个机关印刷厂的工作者，我认为：统一管理比分散管理好。
    几年来，中央机关印刷厂发展很快，到目前为止，大概已有四、五十处之多，分属于党、政、军的行政部门和出版社领导。发展快的原因，一个是机关印刷任务在逐年增加，但更主要的是因为分散领导，各个单位只是根据本单位的任务来设立或扩建印刷厂，而没有、也无法考虑到社会上的印刷力量。这样就造成：有的印刷任务不足，经常停工；有的则加班加点，盲目扩建；没有印刷厂的单位，还打算设厂。这样各搞一套的结果，浪费了国家的建设资金。再加上印刷厂获得的利润和折旧费又不上缴，由各单位自己支配，也容易造成浪费。如果这些印刷厂实行统一管理，国家不但不需要再投资办印刷厂，还可以减少对国营印刷厂和地方国营印刷厂的投资；各个印刷厂也就不必花好几十万元去单搞一套照相、铜模、修配等辅助车间。国家可以给印刷厂分配任务，规定上缴利润和折旧费上缴的办法，每年能有几百万元的收入，还可以减少大批的行政管理人员。
