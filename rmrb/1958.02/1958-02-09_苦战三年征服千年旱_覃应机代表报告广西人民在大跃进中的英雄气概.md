In the process of building water conservancy projects, the masses used folk songs to express their determination and confidence: "Don't rely on the heavens, rely on ourselves, build water conservancy to conquer it. Even if the heavens don't rain, we can still make the seedlings sprout." "A thousand years of bitter drought, full of tears, only knowing to pray to gods and worship heaven. Now with the Communist Party, we will build water conservancy and celebrate a bumper harvest."

I fully support the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

In 1957, Guangxi, like the rest of the country, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, after the struggle against the rightists and the all-people rectification movement, greatly improved the political and ideological level and the revolutionary enthusiasm of all cadres and people of all ethnic groups in the province for building socialism, and achieved remarkable results in all aspects of work. In terms of agricultural production, although it suffered continuous drought losses, the total grain output still increased from 10.5 billion jin in 1956 to 10.7 billion jin; the total sugarcane output increased by 33.5 percent compared with 1956; peanuts increased by 62.5 percent; oil tea increased by 70 percent; and the number of live pigs increased from 3.76 million in 1956 to 5 million, an increase of more than 30 percent. Other cash crops also saw significant increases.

Since last winter, a large-scale mass winter production movement centered on water conservancy construction and manure accumulation has been launched throughout the province. This movement is still at its peak and is continuing to develop vigorously and comprehensively.

The People of All Ethnic Groups Build Water Conservancy

　　Block the river water, dam the mountain water
　　Store the rainwater, dig out the ground water
    
Throughout history, drought has been the biggest threat to agricultural production in our province, and the construction of farmland water conservancy is the basic key to ensuring a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in our province. Laibin County used to be the driest and most bitter place in our province. People called it "The crops will suffer if there's no rain for five days, it'll become a disaster if there's no rain for half a month, burning dry rice flies all over the sky, no grass grows for three consecutive months." However, after two years of hard work in water conservancy construction in 1956 and 1957, the irrigated area increased by 490,000 mu. Now it has begun to fundamentally change its old appearance. In 1956, in the event of a severe drought, the total grain output of the county still increased by 81 percent compared with 1952. In 1957, for the first time in history, it achieved grain self-sufficiency, from needing to transfer in 80,000 jin of rice every year. This year, they will be able to eliminate drought. The people of the whole province learned from Laibin's example, under the battle slogan of "Fighting hard for three years to conquer a thousand years of drought," they are determined to make the water conservancy construction in 1958 better and greater. In 1958, the province originally planned to build water conservancy projects to irrigate an area of more than 5 million mu, which was later revised to more than 8 million mu, and was repeatedly broken through by the enthusiasm of the masses. Now, the actual number of large, medium, and small water conservancy projects under construction in the province has reached 103,691, with an irrigated area of 12.09 million mu, exceeding the total of 10.21 million mu of irrigated area built during the first five-year plan period. This is something that has never happened in thousands of years. During the entire period of the Kuomintang's rule in Guangxi, the total area of water conservancy irrigation was only 190,000 mu, which is less than 2 percent of the current irrigation area under construction. Up to now, more than 62,000 water conservancy projects have been completed, with an irrigated area of 3.3 million mu. More than 3 million people in the province are working on water conservancy construction every day, accounting for about 50 percent of the total labor force in the province.

The scale of this year's water conservancy construction is unprecedentedly huge. The people of all ethnic groups have shown a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, doing everything possible to block the river water, dam the mountain water, store the rainwater, dig out the ground water, and pump up the low water.

Not afraid of any difficulties

　　Raise funds ourselves, burn lime ourselves, weave mud baskets ourselves
　　Break rocks ourselves, find sand ourselves, cut wood ourselves
　　Use mountain vines instead of ropes, firewood instead of oil lamps, old materials instead of new materials
    
In the process of building water conservancy projects, the great collective power of the masses after cooperativization was fully demonstrated, and various difficulties were overcome. They proposed: raise funds ourselves, burn lime ourselves, weave mud baskets ourselves, break rocks ourselves, find sand ourselves, cut wood ourselves. Use mountain vines instead of ropes, firewood instead of oil lamps, old materials instead of new materials. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient technology, various places adopted the method of concentrating cadres, teachers, students, and experienced old farmers to hold research meetings, everyone came up with ideas, and then separately conducted preliminary planning for surveying, designing and construction, and then technical personnel or engineers reviewed and the leaders approved, and then construction was carried out. Technicians and engineers made rounds of guidance, using points to represent the whole, using large to lead small, using the advanced to lead the backward, dividing responsibility areas, and leadership inspection to ensure project quality. The masses used such folk songs to express their determination and confidence: "Don't rely on the heavens, rely on ourselves, build water conservancy to conquer it. Even if the heavens don't rain, we can still make the seedlings sprout." "A thousand years of bitter drought, full of tears, only knowing to pray to gods and worship heaven. Now with the Communist Party, we will build water conservancy and celebrate a bumper harvest." From the current development of the movement: 80 percent of the plan can be completed by the end of February, and all can be completed in March. The paddy fields in 50 counties can basically eliminate drought. After the efforts in the second half of the year, the remaining 20 counties can also be basically resolved.

Set off a high tide of manure accumulation

　　Ask the mountains for fertilizer, ask people and animals for fertilizer, ask the fields for fertilizer
　　Ask the ground for fertilizer, ask the bottom of the water for fertilizer, ask the house for fertilizer
    
While water conservancy construction is surging, various places have also quickly organized and set off a high tide of manure accumulation. Our province plans to accumulate 6 billion dan of fertilizer this year. Calculated according to the planting area of 60 million mu, each mu needs to be fertilized with an average of 100 dan. In order to achieve this plan, various places have vigorously mobilized the masses to carry out a mass manure accumulation movement of "everyone contributes ideas, everyone hands in fertilizer, those with strength contribute strength, and those with fertilizer contribute fertilizer." The policy of "exhausting all means to explore fertilizer sources, starting from the big picture, starting from the small, and striving to solve the fertilizer problem ourselves" was implemented. Agricultural cooperatives universally mobilized elderly farmers to contribute ideas and the masses to report fertilizer. Many masses not only labored day and night, but also racked their brains day and night, trying to find ways to ask the mountains for fertilizer, ask people and animals for fertilizer, ask the fields for fertilizer, ask the ground for fertilizer, ask the bottom of the water for fertilizer, and ask the house for fertilizer. Many fertilizer sources that were not seen or thought of on weekdays were discovered, and the long-submerged ancient ponds and the manure pits that had collapsed decades ago and turned into flat ground were all excavated and utilized; the smoke coal on the roof, the charcoal ash in the stove, the garbage heaps on the wasteland, and the rice roots and weeds in the fields were all cleaned up. In just over a month, Luchuan County accumulated an average of more than 160 dan of fertilizer per mu, which is more than four times the total achievement of the four-month manure accumulation movement from the winter of 1956 to the spring of 1957. Many agricultural cooperatives have even more outstanding results, with an average of 400 to 600 dan accumulated per mu. At present, the province as a whole has accumulated an average of 50 dan of fertilizer per mu. This year, the accumulation of fertilizer is not only large in quantity, but also better in quality, and some fertilizer processing has also been carried out to improve fertilizer efficiency. Now, the accumulation of fertilizer in various places, like the construction of water conservancy, is progressing at an alarming rate.

Other aspects: This year, the province plans to afforest 5.5 million mu, an increase of 40 percent compared with 1957. 1.5 million mu of oil tea trees have now been planted, which is the total area of oil tea trees planted from 1953 to 1956. Recently, Luocheng County used the method of building water conservancy projects, living on the construction site to afforest, and afforested 90,000 mu in just four days, exceeding the original annual afforestation plan. At present, afforestation work has begun to enter a tense stage, and it is entirely foreseeable that our province's afforestation task this year can be overfulfilled. This year, the province has planted 10.03 million mu of winter crops, which are currently growing well, and various places are strengthening nursing work to strive for a bumper harvest. The paddy fields and dry land without winter planting have completed winter plowing and are fully carrying out spring plowing production preparations.

Since the resolution on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was adopted by the National People's Congress last year and announced, we have actively carried out preparatory work. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will be established in March this year. The people of all ethnic groups in the province are in an extremely excited mood, making greater achievements on all production fronts to welcome the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and working actively and selflessly to strive for a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1958.

　　苦战三年征服千年旱
    覃应机代表报告广西人民在大跃进中的英雄气概
    在兴修水利过程中，群众用山歌表达自己的决心和信心：“不靠老天靠自家，兴修水利战胜它，就是老天不下雨，也叫禾苗出嫩芽”“千年苦旱泪涟涟，只知求神和拜天，如今有了共产党，修好水利庆丰年”。
    我完全拥护李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长、吴玉章主任的报告。
    一九五七年广西和全国一样，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，经过反右派斗争和全民整风运动，大大地提高了全体干部和全省各族人民的政治思想水平和建设社会主义的革命干劲，各项工作都获得了显著的成绩。农业生产方面虽连续遭受旱灾的损失，但粮食总产量仍由一九五六年的一百零五亿斤增长到一百零七亿斤；甘蔗总产量比一九五六年增长百分之三十三点五；花生增长百分之六十二点五；油茶增加七成；生猪由一九五六年的三百七十六万头增加至五百万头，增长百分之三十多，其他经济作物也有了较大的增长。
    自去冬开始，全省掀起了大规模的群众性的以兴修水利和积肥为中心的冬季生产运动，这个运动还正处在大高潮的时候，并蓬勃地全面地继续发展。
    各族人民修水利
　　把河水拦起来，把山水堵起来
　　把天水蓄起来，把地水挖出来
    历年来旱灾是我省农业生产的最大威胁，兴修农田水利是保证我省农业生产大跃进的基本关键。来宾县过去是我省最旱最苦的地方，人们称它是“五天无雨禾受旱，半月无雨便成灾，火烧枯稻满天飞，连晴三月草不生”。但是经过他们一九五六、一九五七两年的苦干修水利，增加了灌溉四十九万亩。现在已开始从根本上改变了旧的面貌。一九五六年在严重的旱灾情况下全县粮食总产量仍比一九五二年增产百分之八十一，一九五七年有史以来第一次由每年需要调进八万斤大米，做到了粮食自给。今年他们就可以消灭旱灾了。全省人民学习了来宾的榜样，在“苦战三年，征服千年旱灾”的战斗口号下，决心把一九五八年度的水利建设搞得更多更好。一九五八年全省原计划兴修水利灌溉面积五百多万亩，后修订为八百多万亩，又一再为群众的干劲所突破，现在全省实际开工的大、中、小型水利已达十万零三千六百九十一处，灌溉面积一千二百零九万亩，超过了第一个五年计划期间兴修水利灌溉面积一千零二十一万亩的总和。这是千百年来没有过的事情，国民党统治广西的整个时期，所修建水利灌溉总面积只不过十九万亩，还不到我们现在开工灌溉数的百分之二。到目前为止已完成的水利工程六万二千多处，灌溉面积三百三十万亩。全省每日出工修水利的在三百万人以上，占全省总劳动力的百分之五十左右。
    今年的水利建设规模空前的巨大，各族人民拿出了高度的革命干劲，千方百计设法把河水拦起来，把山水堵起来，把天水蓄起来，把地水挖出来，把低水抽上来。
    什么困难都不怕
　　经费自己筹，石灰自己烧，泥箕自己编
　　石料自己打，沙子自己找，木料自己砍
　　山藤代绳索，柴火代油灯，旧料代新料
    在兴修水利过程中，充分地显示了合作化后群众的伟大集体力量，克服了各种困难，他们提出：经费自己筹，石灰自己烧，泥箕自己编，石料自己打，沙子自己找，木料自己砍。山藤代绳索，柴火代油灯，旧料代新料。为了克服技术不足的困难，各地采用集中干部、教师、学生、有经验的老农开研究会，大家出主意，然后分头进行勘察、设计及施工的初步规划，再经过技术员或工程师审查、领导批准、然后施工，技术员和工程师巡回指导，以点代面，以大带小，以先带后，划分责任区，领导检查等方法。以保证工程质量。群众用这样的山歌表达了自己的决心和信心：“不靠老天靠自家，兴修水利战胜它，就是老天不下雨，也叫禾苗出嫩芽”。“千年苦旱泪涟涟，只知求神和拜天，如今有了共产党，修好水利庆丰年”。从当前运动的发展情况来看：二月底能完成计划的百分之八十，三月可全部完成，有五十个县的水田可基本消灭旱灾。再经过下半年的努力，其余二十个县也可以基本解决。
    掀起积肥大高潮
　　向山上要肥　向人畜要肥　向田里要肥
　　向地下要肥　向水底要肥　向屋内要肥
    各地在兴修水利高涨的同时，也迅速地组织和掀起了积肥运动的大高潮。我省今年计划积肥六十亿担，按六千万亩播种面积计算，每亩平均要下肥一百担。为了实现这个计划，各地都大力地发动群众开展了一个“人人献计，人人交肥，有力出力，有肥出肥”的群众性积肥运动。贯彻了“想尽一切办法挖掘肥源，从大处着眼，小处着手，争取自己解决肥料问题”的方针，农业社普遍地发动了老年农民献计，群众报肥。许多群众不仅日夜劳动，并且日夜开动脑筋，多方想办法向山上要肥，向人畜要肥，向田里要肥，向地下要肥，向水底要肥，向屋内要肥。许多地方平日看不见想不到的肥源被发现了，淹没已久的千年古塘泥，几十年前塌下变成了平地的粪坑，都被发掘利用了；屋顶的烟煤，灶里的炭灰，荒地上的垃圾堆，田里的稻根杂草，都被扫清捡净。陆川县在短短的一个多月的时间里每亩就平均积得肥料一百六十多担，为一九五六年冬至一九五七年春积肥运动四个月成绩总和的四倍多。有不少农业社成绩更为突出，平均每亩有积到四百担至六百担的。目前全省平均每亩也已积到五十担肥料。今年积肥不仅数量多，肥料的质量也较好，有的还进行了肥料加工，提高肥效。现在各地的积肥和修水利一样，正在以惊人的速度进展着。
    其他方面：今年全省计划造林五百五十万亩，比一九五七年增加百分之四十。现在已种下的油茶树一百五十万亩，为一九五三年至一九五六年种植油茶树面积的总和。罗城县最近运用了修水利的办法，住在工地造林，仅四天的时间就造林九万亩，超额完成了原订全年的造林计划。目前造林工作正开始进入紧张阶段，完全可以预料我省今年的造林任务是可以超额完成的。今年全省冬种作物已种下一千零三万亩，当前生长良好，各地正加强护理工作争取丰收。没有冬种的水田和旱地已完成了冬耕，并全面地进行春耕生产准备工作。
    自从去年全国人民代表大会通过成立广西僮族自治区的决议公布以后，我们积极地进行了筹备工作，广西僮族自治区即将于今年三月间成立。全省各族人民都怀着无比兴奋的心情，在各个生产战线上做出更大的成绩，来迎接广西僮族自治区的成立。为争取一九五八年农业生产的全面大跃进而积极忘我的劳动。
