The Budget Committee of the First National People's Congress, after listening to the report by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, on the implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the draft 1958 National Budget, conducted a detailed review of the implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the draft 1958 National Budget. I now present the results of the review on behalf of the Budget Committee as follows:

The Budget Committee believes that the implementation of the 1957 National Budget was good, and the State Council's analysis and estimation of the 1957 budget implementation are accurate. In 1957, the nationwide rectification campaign and the struggle against right-wing elements not only achieved great victories on the political and ideological fronts, but also propelled the campaign to increase production and practice economy to a new and higher level, thereby achieving remarkable success on the financial and economic fronts. The result of the 1957 National Budget implementation was: revenue exceeded expenditure, with a certain surplus; and on this basis, a portion of the market currency in circulation was reduced, and commodity inventory and material reserves were supplemented and increased, thereby alleviating the once tense situation of some material supplies at the beginning of the year, and maintaining the basic stability of market prices. The overfulfillment of the 1957 national fiscal revenue and expenditure plan ensured the completion of the construction plan in the final year of the First Five-Year Plan, powerfully demonstrating the strong vitality and superiority of the socialist system, and the great significance of bringing into play the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people under the new socialist relations of production.

In the process of budget implementation, the State Council, based on the increase in revenue and according to necessity and possibility, timely added a portion of expenditures; and saved a portion of non-productive expenditures, and increased expenditures in economic construction. These adjustment measures were necessary and appropriate.

Because the budget report is submitted earlier this year, the formal 1957 national final accounts still need some time to be compiled. The Budget Committee suggests that the National People's Congress approve in principle the State Council's report on the implementation of the 1957 National Budget; and recommends that the National People's Congress authorize the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to be responsible for reviewing and approving the formally submitted 1957 national final accounts in the future.

The Budget Committee has carefully reviewed the draft 1958 National Budget and believes that this budget is one that implements the opposition to conservatism and waste, and is a budget that actively increases production, expands capital construction, and vigorously supports agriculture. The Budget Committee believes that this budget, as stated in the State Council's report, embodies the policy put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, embodies our country's policy of peaceful construction, embodies the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, running undertakings diligently and thriftily, and running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and embodies the principle of developing socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The realization of this budget will enable our country's industrial and agricultural production and socialist construction to take a big step forward; and will create a good start for the smooth realization of our country's Second Five-Year Plan.

In view of the fact that the new construction upsurge on various production fronts is continuing to rise, and in view of the fact that the campaign to increase production and practice economy and the struggle against waste being carried out throughout the country are increasingly providing new possibilities for increasing revenue, the Budget Committee believes that the draft 1958 National Budget can still be considered for some adjustments in order to increase revenue as much as possible and arrange more expenditures. To this end, the Budget Committee proposes the following adjustment opinions on the figures of the 1958 National Budget revenue and expenditure:

One, increase revenue by 135 million yuan. Among them, customs revenue increased by 40 million yuan, metallurgical industry revenue increased by 30 million yuan, textile industry revenue increased by 35 million yuan, and railway revenue increased by 30 million yuan.

Two, increase expenditure by 135 million yuan. Among them, in addition to increasing foreign aid expenditure by 40 million yuan, the remaining 95 million yuan is temporarily listed under the general reserve fund, and the State Council will study and allocate it to increase economic construction expenditure.

After the above adjustments, the 1958 National Budget revenue and expenditure figures increased to 33,198 million yuan, and expenditure increased to 33,198 million yuan, with revenue and expenditure still balanced. In addition, the 1958 budget also includes 1,098 million yuan each of enterprise retained earnings and expenditures arranged with enterprise retained earnings, which are not included in the above figures.

The Budget Committee believes that the 1958 National Budget after such adjustments is still positive and reliable. It can be completed as long as efforts are made. The Budget Committee suggests that the National People's Congress adopt the above adjustment opinions and approve the adjusted 1958 National Budget.

Considering that some new situations may be encountered in the process of budget implementation, and necessary adjustments need to be made; and when revenue exceeds and expenditure has a surplus, it is also necessary to arrange some more expenditures according to actual possibilities. The Budget Committee suggests: authorize the State Council to adjust the national budget revenue and expenditure figures once every quarter, and report to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress at an appropriate time.

At present, the production upsurge is developing rapidly, and the broad masses of people are full of infinite confidence in building socialism, going all out, aiming high, and striving for the upstream. This situation provides extremely favorable conditions for the smooth realization of the 1958 National Budget. At present, the task of all localities, departments, enterprises, and units across the country is to continue to deepen the campaign to increase production and practice economy on the basis of thorough rectification, deepen the anti-waste struggle, fully mobilize and rely on the broad masses to increase production, increase revenue, save expenditures, and fulfill and overfulfill the national budget perfectly.

The above opinions are submitted to the Congress for review.

    第一届全国人民代表大会预算委员会关于一九五七年国家预算的执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的审查报告
    预算委员会主任委员　刘澜涛
    第一届全国人民代表大会预算委员会在听了国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念代表国务院所作的关于1957年国家预算执行情况和1958年国家预算草案的报告以后，对1957年国家预算执行情况和1958年国家预算草案，进行了详细的审查。现在我代表预算委员会将审查的结果报告如下：
    预算委员会认为，1957年国家预算的执行情况是良好的，国务院对于1957年预算执行情况的分析和估计是确当的。1957年在全国范围内，开展了全民整风运动和反击右派分子的斗争，不仅在政治战线和思想战线上取得了伟大的胜利，同时把增产节约运动推向新的更高的水平，从而在财政经济战线上获得了显著的成就。1957年国家预算执行的结果是：财政收多于支，有一定的结余；并且在这个基础上，减少了一部分市场货币流通量，补充和增加了商品库存和物资储备，从而缓和了年初一度发生的若干物资供应紧张的情况，使市场物价继续获得了基本上的稳定。1957年国家财政收支计划的超额完成，保证了第一个五年计划最后一年建设计划的完成，有力地说明了社会主义制度的强大生命力和优越性，说明了新的社会主义生产关系下面发挥劳动人民革命积极性的重大意义。
      国务院在预算执行过程当中，根据收入增加的情况，根据必要和可能，及时地追加了一部分支出；并且节省了一部分非生产性支出，增加了经济建设方面的支出。这些调整的措施是必要的，恰当的。
    因为今年提出预算报告的时间较早，1957年正式的国家决算还须要经过一段时间才能编成。预算委员会建议全国人民代表大会对国务院提出的1957年国家预算的执行情况，原则上给予批准；并且建议全国人民代表大会授权全国人民代表大会常务委员会，对将来正式报送的1957年国家决算负责加以审查批准。
    预算委员会详细地审查了1958年国家预算草案，认为这个预算是一个贯彻执行反对保守、反对浪费的预算，是一个积极增加生产、扩大基本建设和大力支援农业的预算。预算委员会认为，这个预算正如国务院报告中所说：是体现了中共中央和毛主席所提出的在优先发展重工业的基础上发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，体现了我国和平建设的方针，体现了勤俭建国，勤俭办企业、勤俭办事业和勤俭办合作社的方针，并且体现了又多又快又好又省地发展社会主义建设事业的方针。这个预算的实现，将使我国工农业生产和社会主义建设，向前大大跨进一步；并且将为我国第二个五年建设计划的顺利实现，创造良好的开端。
    鉴于目前各个生产战线上新的建设高潮正在继续高涨，鉴于在全国范围内进行的增产节约运动和反对浪费的斗争正在越来越多地提供新的增加收入的可能，预算委员会认为，1958年国家预算草案还可以考虑作若干调整，以便尽可能再增加一些收入，更多地安排一些支出。为此，预算委员会对1958年国家预算收支的数字，提出如下的调整意见：
    一、增加收入一亿三千五百万元。其中，关税收入增加四千万元，冶金工业收入增加三千万元，纺织工业收入增加三千五百万元，铁道收入增加三千万元。
    二、增加支出一亿三千五百万元。其中，除了增加对外援助支出四千万元以外，其余九千五百万元，暂时列在总预备费项下，由国务院研究分配，用来增加经济建设支出。
    1958年国家预算收支数字，经过以上调整，收入增加为三百三十一亿九千八百万元，支出增加为三百三十一亿九千八百万元，收支仍然平衡。此外，1958年预算中还有企业留成收入和用企业留成收入安排的支出各十亿九千八百万元，没有包括在上述数字以内。
    预算委员会认为，这样调整以后的1958年国家预算，仍然是积极而又可靠的。只要经过努力是可以完成的。预算委员会建议全国人民代表大会采纳上述调整意见，批准经过调整后的1958年国家预算。
    考虑到在预算执行的过程中还可能遇到一些新的情况，需要作必要的调整；在收入超过、支出有余的时候，也还有必要根据实际可能，多安排一些支出。预算委员会建议：授权国务院在每个季度对国家预算收支数字进行一次调整，并且在适当的时候报告全国人民代表大会常务委员会。
    目前生产高潮正在一日千里地向前发展，广大人民满怀着对建设社会主义的无限信心，鼓足干劲，力争上游。这种形势为1958年国家预算的顺利实现提供了极为有利的条件。目前全国各地方各部门各企业各单位的任务是，在深入整改的基础上，继续深入开展增产节约运动，深入进行反浪费斗争，充分发动和依靠广大群众增加生产，增加收入，节约支出，完满地实现和超额实现国家预算。
    以上意见，请大会审查。
