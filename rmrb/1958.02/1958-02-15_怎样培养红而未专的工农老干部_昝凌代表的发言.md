How to Cultivate Red and Not Yet Expert Worker-Peasant Veteran Cadres
Speech by Delegate Zan Ling

    I fully agree with and support the four reports made at the conference.

    I strongly support Director Wu Yuzhang's report on language reform and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. I am someone who has suffered from rare characters. My surname has caused me a lot of trouble. My surname is a very rare character. Common rare characters can be avoided, but a surname cannot be avoided. In daily life, I am most afraid of people asking me what my surname is. If someone asks, I first have to find a piece of paper, write my surname down for them to see, and read it to them several times, hoping they can remember it. But the next time I ask them to write it, most people write it as the "gui" in sundial (日晷), or the "jiu" in "past misdeeds need not be investigated" (既往不咎). Even many of my old classmates and close friends are no exception. It's not their fault for not remembering it; Chinese characters are just difficult. A word spoken cannot be written down, and a word written down cannot be read out. The image and pronunciation are two different things. Especially when encountering words that are not used daily and have no explanation, it is even more difficult. The phonetic alphabet scheme solves this problem. Writing my surname as "Zan," I think everyone who has learned Hanyu Pinyin can definitely read and write it. If it is possible to use phonetic writing to replace some difficult-to-write and difficult-to-recognize Chinese characters in the future, I hope my surname will be included in the first batch.

    Worker-peasant veteran cadres have undergone years of training and testing. Now that they have moved to economic construction posts, they generally urgently need to learn professional knowledge. They are the country's most valuable assets, and efforts should be made to make them excellent organizers and leaders of economic construction.

    Next, I would like to talk about the issue of cultivating worker-peasant veteran cadres to master professional knowledge. To build a socialist society, cadres are indispensable. Cadres must be "red" because we are building a socialist and communist society, not any other society. Cadres must be "expert," otherwise it will be difficult to play any role in the great task of building a modern industry, agriculture, science, and culture. Cultivating a younger generation that is both "red and expert" is certainly a very important aspect, but cultivating existing cadres to become qualified economic construction organizers and leaders, or reserve forces for organizers and leaders, who are both "red and expert," is also an aspect that cannot be ignored. These cadres must have a firm political stance, resolutely take the socialist road, and be able to implement the Party's guidelines and policies. In terms of professional skills, they must be experts, only then can they be called qualified.

    Cadres who are "expert but not red" must undergo practical labor training, put down the airs of intellectuals, and cultivate proletarian feelings, thereby firming their proletarian stance. This is absolutely necessary, and we will not discuss it much here. We will only talk about the cultivation of worker-peasant veteran cadres who are "red but not expert."

    Worker-peasant veteran cadres have undergone years of training. Among them, cadres at the department and factory levels have generally participated in the revolution for ten to twenty years. Some have even undergone the test of battlefields and prisons. The vast majority of them are good comrades who are determined to contribute everything for the cause of communism. However, they have also lost the opportunity to learn professional skills because of participating in the revolution, or even if they have learned professional knowledge, they have gradually neglected it due to years of participating in the revolution. After the liberation of the whole country, the country embarked on the stage of economic construction, and a considerable part of the veteran cadres also transferred to new positions in economic construction. They have seized the time to learn in their posts, and some of them have indeed mastered a considerable amount of professional knowledge. However, because their basic knowledge is relatively poor, it is difficult for them to continue to improve. They urgently need to learn knowledge in production management, production technology, and basic science. They are still in their prime, and they have full of drive, but they lack the weapons of science, technology, and professional knowledge. After the slogans of "both red and expert" and "technical revolution" were put forward in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, the mood of this group of cadres became even more tense. I am not a worker-peasant veteran cadre, so I cannot express my personal experience in this regard, but their anxiety is completely understandable. Their anxiety is not for themselves, they are worried that their contribution to the people will gradually decrease. I know that there are many veteran cadres who have been studying basic courses in science and technology day and night for several years, but due to a lack of guidance, the results are not great. The drive and strength of this group of cadres are the most valuable assets of our Party and the country. Giving them the weapon of scientific and technological knowledge will make them excellent organizers and leaders of economic construction. This is not only what should be done, but also necessary for national construction.

    Establishing special cadre classes in relevant universities and colleges is an effective way to cultivate worker-peasant veteran cadres. To do this work well, it is necessary to send cadres suitable for training selected from the organs; classes should be arranged according to the level of education; the study time should not be too long, so that more people have the opportunity to be trained.

    There can be various methods of cultivation. Opening more spare-time schools so that cadres can study while working is one aspect. But in order to help these cadres master technical knowledge more quickly, establishing special cadre classes in relevant universities and colleges is a more effective method. In order to train this group of cadres, the state began to establish special cadre classes in relevant universities and colleges in 1957. In 1957, the number of cadres reached four hundred, and it will increase several times in 1958, which we strongly support. However, the past special cadre classes also had some problems that must be properly resolved in order to ensure that this work is done well.

    1.  When selecting and sending worker-peasant veteran cadres to universities and colleges for study, the schools are generally willing to accept and attach importance to this task. Most schools send better professors and lecturers to teach and tutor. However, the units to which these cadres belong emphasize that their work cannot be separated from them and are unwilling to select and send more cadres. It should be considered that this is an important measure to cultivate the backbone and reserve forces for socialist construction. Suitable veteran cadres who are basically healthy and have a certain level of education should be carefully selected. They should temporarily overcome the difficulties in their work and send them to schools for training. This has the same or greater significance as sending cadres who are "expert but not red" to lower levels for training.

    2.  The educational levels of the cadres selected and sent in this way are mostly uneven. If they are not separated and placed in the same class for training, good results will not be achieved. First of all, the original sending unit must pay attention to the educational level of the cadres and not have too much disparity. After arriving at the school, classes should also be separated according to the specific situation. If necessary, some advanced worker-peasant middle schools or worker-peasant preparatory classes can be attended before entering the university special classes. In this way, teachers will not have the difficulty of "listening if it is too shallow, not understanding if it is too deep, and taking care of one thing and losing sight of the other," and the learning effect can also be improved. Some cadres with higher levels can specialize in some professional courses.

    3.  Cadres selected and sent in this way generally have strong organizational skills and more practical experience in life and production. The purpose of selecting them for training is to supplement their basic scientific and technical knowledge and professional knowledge, and to become better organizers and leaders. In their future positions, they must also continue to study and improve in combination with practical work. However, some comrades in the special classes require learning too many technical courses in order to become engineers and experts in the future. This idea is also incorrect. For them, the time required to become engineers or experts who solve specific technical problems will be too long. At the same time, becoming engineers or experts is not the most appropriate way for them to play their role. Therefore, their study time does not have to be very long. They can be taught relevant basic and professional courses according to the needs of their positions. Other courses that are not very useful for their positions can be appropriately reduced. This can shorten the training time and allow more people to have the opportunity to be trained.

    4.  Such cadres are generally politically well-trained. The school lacks such talents when carrying out movements. The units send cadres, and the school feels that they have come at the right time. It is just right to help the school do a good job in political study and participate in grasping political movements. They forget that these cadres are sent to the school by various construction departments to overcome difficulties for the future. If the school does not insist on letting them study with peace of mind, it will lose the original meaning of the selection and transfer.

    Please give your opinions on the above suggestions.

    怎样培养红而未专的工农老干部
    昝凌代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护大会所作的四个报告。
    吴玉章主任关于文字改革和汉语拼音方案的报告，我十分拥护。我就是吃尽生僻字苦头的一个人，我这个姓就给我带来不少麻烦，我的姓就是一个相当生僻的生僻字，一般的生僻字可以避而不用，作为一个姓可不能避而不用，在日常生活中，我最怕人家问我姓什么，有人要问，我就首先要找一张纸，把我的姓写下来给他看，还得读几遍给他听，希望他能记住了，谁知下次再请他写，绝大多数人不是写成日晷的晷，就是写成既往不咎的咎，甚至我有许多老同学、熟朋友，也不例外。不能怪人家记不住，汉字就是困难。口说出来的字写不下来，写下来的字读不出来，形象和发音是两回事。尤其碰到日常不用，没有讲解的字，就更难了。拼音方案就解决了这个问题，把我的姓写成Zan，所有学过汉语拼音的人，我想一定都能读，也都能写。如果将来有可能用拼音文字，代替一些难写难认的汉字，我希望把我的姓列入第一批。
    工农老干部都经历过多年的锻炼和考验，现在转到经济建设岗位上，一般都迫切要求学习专业知识。他们是国家的最珍贵的财产，应该设法使他们成为很好的经济建设的组织者和领导者。
    其次，我想谈谈培养工农老干部掌握专业知识的问题。要建设社会主义社会，没有干部是不行的。干部必须红，因为我们建设的是社会主义、共产主义社会而不是其他社会。干部必须专，否则就很难在建设现代化工业、农业、科学文化的伟大任务里起到什么作用，培养又红又专的青年一代，当然是非常重要的一面，而把现有干部培养成又红又专的、称职的经济建设的组织者和领导者，或者组织者领导者的后备力量也是不可忽视的一面。这些干部在政治上必须立场坚定，坚决走社会主义道路，能够贯彻党的方针路线，在业务上必须是一个内行，然后才能称得起称职二字。
    专而未红的干部必须通过实际劳动锻炼，放下知识分子架子，培养无产阶级感情，从而坚定无产阶级立场，这是完全必要的，我们且不多谈，我们在这里单谈红而未专的工农老干部的培养问题。
    工农老干部曾经经历过多年的锻炼，其中处一级和厂一级的干部，参加革命一般都在十年到二十年之间，有的还经过战场和法庭监狱的考验，他们中绝大多数是坚定的为了共产主义事业而愿贡献一切的好同志，但是他们也都是因为参加革命而失去了学习专业的机会，或者虽曾学过专业知识，也因参加革命多年而逐渐荒废。全国解放之后，国家走上了经济建设阶段，老干部中有相当大的一部分也就转上了经济建设的新岗位上来，他们在工作岗位上曾抓紧学习，其中一部分人也确实掌握了相当多的业务知识。但究竟因为他们的基础知识较差，继续提高就有一定困难了，他们迫切要求学习生产管理、生产技术和科学基础等方面的知识，他们还正在壮年，他们有十足的干劲，可就是缺乏科学技术和专业知识这种武器。在社会主义建设大跃进中，又红又专和技术革命等口号提出来之后，这部分干部的心情就更加紧张了。我不是工农老干部，我说不出来这方面的切身体会，但是他们着急的心情则是完全可以理解的，他们着急不是为了个人，他们担心自己对人民的贡献会逐渐减低下来。我知道有不少的老干部，他们几年来一直在日以继夜，夜以继日地自修科学技术的基本课程，但因缺乏指导，收效总是不大。这部分干部的干劲和力量，是我们党和国家最珍贵的财产，教给他们科学技术知识这门武器，他们就会成为很好的经济建设的组织者和领导者。这不但是应该的，也是国家建设所必要的。
    在有关大学和学院内设立干部特别班是培养工农老干部的有效方法。为了做好这一工作，须要保送机关抽调适合培养的干部；应该按照文化程度安排班次；学习时间不宜太长，以便更多的人得到培养的机会。
    培养的方法可以多种多样，多开办业余学校，使干部能够在职学习是一个方面。但为了更快地帮助这些干部掌握技术知识，在有关大学和学院内设立干部特别班，则是更有效的方法，国家为了培养这部分干部，曾自一九五七年开始在各有关大学和学院内成立了干部特别班，一九五七年发展到四百人，一九五八年还要增加几倍，这是我们十分拥护的。但是过去的干部特别班也存在一些问题，必须求得适当的解决，才能保证做好这项工作。
    1．抽调工农老干部到大学、学院去学习，学校都普遍愿意接受并重视这项任务，大部学校都派出较好的教授、讲师，担任教学和辅导，可是这些干部所属的单位，反而有强调工作离不开，不肯多抽调的现象。应该认为这是培养社会主义建设骨干和后备力量的一项重要措施，应该认真地挑选适合于培养的，身体情况基本良好，而又具有一定文化水平的老干部，暂时克服一下工作中的困难，把他们送到学校培养，这和把专而未红的干部下放锻炼具有同等或更大的意义。
    2．这样抽调出来的干部，文化程度多半参差不齐，假如不加分别放在一班培养，就不会收到好的效果。首先原抽调单位必须注意干部的文化程度，不要悬殊过多，到学校后还要按具体情况分别班次，必要时可以有一部分先进工农中学或工农预科，然后再进大学特别班，这样，教师才不致有“浅了不听，深了不懂，顾此失彼”的困难，学习效果也能提高，还有一部分水平较高的干部可以专听一些专业课程。
    3．经过这样挑选抽调出来的干部，一般都具有较强的组织能力，较多的生活和生产上的实际经验，抽出来培养的目的是补充他们的科学技术基础和专业知识，成为更好的组织者和领导者。在他们未来的岗位上，还要结合实际工作，继续钻研提高。但是在特别班的干部中，有一部分同志要求学习过多的技术课程，以便将来成为工程师和专家。这种想法也是不对的，对他们来说，要成为解决具体技术问题的工程师或专家，所需时间会嫌太长，同时，成为工程师或专家也不是他们发挥作用最适当的使用方法。因此，他们的学习时间不一定很长，可以结合他们的职务需要，讲授有关的基础和专业课程，对他们职务用处不多的其他课程，可以适当减少，这样就可缩短培养时间，使更多的人得到培养的机会。
    4．这样的干部，一般都是在政治上锻炼有素的，学校搞运动，正缺乏这样的人才，机关单位把干部送来，学校觉得来得正好，正好帮助学校搞好政治学习，参加掌握政治运动，就忘了这些干部都是各建设部门克服困难，为了将来而派送到学校培养的，学校如不坚持让他们安心学习，那就失去了当初抽调的意义。
    以上意见请各位代表加以指正。
