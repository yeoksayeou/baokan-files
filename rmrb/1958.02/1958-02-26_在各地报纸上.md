    Lixian County Basically Eliminates the Four Pests
    The Hebei Daily on the 24th, in a front-page headline in bright red characters, praised Lixian County for its glorious achievement in basically achieving the "Four Nos" after two years of hard work, calling it an unprecedented feat, a pioneer in eliminating the four pests, and published an editorial entitled "Learn from Lixian, Catch up with Lixian." Page 2 published the Lixian County Party Committee's experience in eliminating the four pests, and page 4 of the pictorial introduced the situation in Zhengcun Township, Lixian County, after achieving the "Four Nos", and further carrying out cleaning. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council, in the "Instructions on Eliminating the Four Pests and Promoting Hygiene," mentioned Lixian County, Hebei. The people of this county, with full revolutionary enthusiasm, enabled the county to basically achieve the "Four Nos" on February 16. Page 1 also reported on the situation of more than 100 responsible cadres from local, municipal, and county Party committees who participated in the provincial four-level cadre meeting organized by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, visiting Lixian County.
    This Year Will Become a Thousand-Jin County
    On the 24th, the Dazhong Daily, under the headline "Overall Water Conservancy, 10,000 Jin of Fertilizer per Mu, Major Soil Improvement, Comprehensive Technological Innovation," reported on the grand plans of Shouzhang and Huangxian counties to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production this year. Shouzhang County's battle cry is "Cross the Yellow River, cross the Yangtze River, guarantee 1,000 jin of grain per mu." They specifically put forward four measures to increase production: vigorously increasing the planting of high-yield crops, vigorously developing water conservancy, applying large amounts of fertilizer, and actively promoting technological reforms. In striving for water conservancy this year, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of "storing water from the sky, using water from the river, and digging water from the ground." Huangxian County's plan requires doubling grain production this year to become a thousand-jin county; at the same time, it must also drive a great leap forward in fisheries and sideline production, striving to achieve an average of 1,700 jin of grain per person and an income of 150 yuan.
    All-Purpose Technicians
    In the era of the Great Leap Forward, how many intelligent and heroic figures emerged from the masses! The Shanxi Daily on the 23rd published two newsletters reporting on the wisdom and creativity of these masses. In a newsletter written by reporter Yue Feng, he vividly and interestingly introduced the "all-purpose technicians" of Mishan Township, Gaoping County, and their creations. These are several ordinary farmers: one is Li Zengfu, a commune member who likes to think and research, one is Niu Fuyi, a bold and capable carpenter, and one is Li Ansong, a bicycle repair worker who is diligent and loves to experiment... There are also carpenters and blacksmiths. This group led the masses to study and work hard together, making most of the township's cultivated land water conservancy, and also cultivated fruit trees, raised bees, and opened small factories. Surrounding townships came here to repair locomotive boilers and double-shared plows. Another newsletter, "Relying on the Masses Can Achieve More, Faster, Better, and More Economically," introduced the creations of the masses in Weijiazhuang, Luan, in water conservancy. In the editorial "We Must Believe That the Masses Can Liberate Themselves," the Shanxi Daily discussed these two examples, illustrating the importance of relying on the masses.
    Fifty New Factories and Mines Put into Production
    On the 22nd, the Gansu Daily spread a piece of good news: fifty factories and mines newly established by nine counties, including Xihe, Qingshui, and Qin'an, have been put into production. These factories and mines prominently reflect the orientation of local industry towards rural areas. For example, Xihe County relied on agricultural cooperatives to open a peat factory, solving the problem of fuel for heating beds for the masses. Qingshui County's iron and wood farm implement repair factory and Qin'an's foundry also directly serve local agricultural production.
    The management forms of these factories and mines are also unique: some are cooperatives between supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives; some are funded by the masses, with cadres sent down to work as workers and management personnel; and some are collectively invested by handicraft cooperatives.
    How is the Quality?
    The water conservancy projects built in Anhui Province from last winter to this spring are truly numerous and fast. What about the quality? This is what people are concerned about. Two news items published in the Anhui Daily on the 23rd gave people satisfactory answers. One news item said that two Soviet experts from the Ministry of Water Resources, after visiting many counties in Anhui Province, expressed satisfaction with the quality of the water conservancy projects built by the masses. Another news item reported on the inspection and acceptance work carried out in various places for completed projects. The results of the inspection and acceptance showed that the quality and benefits of most projects met the standards. Various places are generally very serious in carrying out this work. For example, Xuan City, Fanchang and other counties adopted the method of "inserting signs for evaluation," inserting red signs with "standard section" and "standard pond dam" for projects with good quality; inserting yellow signs with "strive for better" for projects with generally standard quality; and inserting white signs with "repair immediately" for non-standard projects, indicating where needs to be repaired, how much earthwork needs to be done, and how much labor is needed.
    "Foreign Province Abundant Harvest Experience"
    On the 23rd, a new column appeared on page 2 of the Zhejiang Daily: "Foreign Province Abundant Harvest Experience." An article entitled "Bold Experiment, Amazing Achievement" introduced the experience of Lin Shimeng and other three people from the No. 2 Agricultural Cooperative of May 1st Commune, Zhongyi Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province, in planting experimental fields with a yield of more than 1,270 jin of seed cotton per mu. This article was written by Zhang Yunxiao, a reporter from the Zhejiang Daily. In order to introduce this experience, he specially visited Lin Shimeng, the deputy director of the cooperative and secretary of the Party branch, who was responsible for planting the experimental fields.

    蠡县基本消灭四害
    河北日报24日一版头条以鲜红的大字标题表扬蠡县奋战两年基本实现四无的辉煌成就，称之为史无前例的壮举，消灭四害的先锋，并发表了“学习蠡县，赶上蠡县”的社论。二版发表了蠡县县委会消灭四害的经验，四版画刊介绍了蠡县郑村乡实现四无以后，进一步进行扫除的情形。中共中央和国务院在“关于除四害讲卫生的指示”中，曾提到河北的蠡县。这个县的人民鼓足革命干劲，使全县在2月16日基本实现了“四无”。一版还报道了中共河北省委组织参加省四级干部会议的各地、市、县党委负责干部一百多人到蠡县参观的情形。
    今年就要成为千斤县
    24日大众日报在“全面水利化，亩施万斤肥，土壤大改良，技术齐革新”的专栏标题下，报道了寿张、黄县争取今年农业生产大跃进的宏伟规划。寿张县的战斗口号是“跨黄河、过长江，保证每亩千斤粮”。他们具体地提出了大力增种高产作物、大兴水利、大量施肥、积极推行技术改革等四项增产措施。在争取今年水利化中，要坚决贯彻“把天上的水蓄起来，河里的水用起来，地下的水挖出来”的方针。黄县的规划要求今年粮食产量翻一翻，实现千斤县；同时还要带动渔业、副业生产大跃进，争取做到每人平均占有粮食一千七百斤，收入一百五十元。
    万能技师
    在大跃进的年代，群众中有多少聪明的、英雄的人物涌现出来！23日的山西日报发表了两篇通讯，报道这些群众的智慧和创造。在记者岳峰写的一篇通讯里，生动而有趣地介绍了高平县米山乡的“万能技师”和他们的创造。这是几个普普通通的农民：一个是肯想好研究的社员李增福，一个是胆大肯干的木匠牛福义，一个是手勤爱试验的修自行车工人李安松……还有木匠、铁匠，这一伙人带领群众一块钻研苦干，使全乡大部耕地水利化，还培植了果树，养了蜜蜂，还开办了小工厂，周围乡都来这里修锅驼机，双铧犁。另一篇“依靠群众便能多快好省”的通讯，介绍了潞安魏家庄群众在水利上的创造。山西日报在“要相信群众能自己解放自己”的社论里，论述了这两个典型，说明依靠群众的重要。
    五十个新厂矿投入生产
    22日，甘肃日报传播了一条喜讯：西和、清水、秦安等九个县新办的五十个厂矿投入了生产。这些厂矿突出地体现了地方工业面向农村的方针。像西和县依靠农业社开办了一个泥煤厂，解决了群众烧炕的燃料问题。清水县的铁木农具修配厂、秦安的翻砂厂，也都直接为当地农业生产服务。
    这批厂矿的经办形式也是别开生面的：有的是供销社和农业社合作；有的是群众集资，下放干部当工人和管理人员，有的是手工业社集体投资。
    质量如何？
    安徽省去冬今春兴修水利工程真是又多又快。质量如何呢？这是人们关心的。23日安徽日报发表的两条消息，给了人们满意的回答。一条消息说，水利部两位苏联专家在安徽省许多县份参观后，对群众兴修的水利工程质量表示满意。另一条消息报道各地对已竣工的工程进行了检查验收工作。检查验收的结果表明，绝大部分工程的质量和效益合乎标准。各地进行这一工作一般都很认真，例如宣城、繁昌等县采取“插牌鉴定”的办法，对工程质量好的插上“标准段”、“标准塘坝”的红牌子；对工程质量一般符合标准的，插上“争取更好”的黄牌子；对不合标准的，插上“立即加修”的白牌子，并注明何处需要加修，需做多少土方和用多少劳力。
    “外省丰产经验”
    23日，浙江日报二版出现了一个新的栏目：“外省丰产经验”。一篇题为“大胆的试验，惊人的成就”的文章，介绍了湖北麻城县中一乡五一第二农业社林世猛等三人所种试验田亩产籽棉一千二百七十多斤的经验。这篇文章是浙江日报的记者张云啸写的，他为了介绍这个经验，特地访问了负责种试验田的该社副主任、党分支部书记林世猛。
