Increased Enthusiasm After Seeing Qi Baishi's Paintings – Workers' Remarks
　　Yù Fēng

　　Qi Baishi had a self-carved seal: "I am one of the grass and wood people." This self-declaration explains the fundamental reason why Qi Baishi was able to become a great people's artist.

　　In the January 24th issue of the Beijing Daily, there was a short article by Wu Nianhai, an apprentice painter at the Beijing Thermal Power Plant construction site. He said that he was moved by Qi Baishi's works and his lifelong artistic labor. He took advantage of the three opportunities he had to rest during the day after working night shifts to visit the Qi Baishi posthumous exhibition at the Soviet Exhibition Center three times. He also used his not-so-rich money to buy more than sixty reproductions of paintings. Back at the construction site, he opened an exhibition in the dining hall, showing it to all his colleagues. He also wrote a clapper talk to explain the paintings and cut out articles from the newspaper to post them, adding a fiery atmosphere to the construction site already filled with big-character posters and pledges. The last paragraph of his clapper talk reads:

　　"We must be promoters,
　　Set off a high tide of enthusiasm,
　　Seeing Baishi's paintings at this time,
　　Our thousand-jin enthusiasm increases again!"

　　He also wrote four sentences in the exhibition's suggestion book: "I am a construction worker, adding scenery to the motherland every day. After seeing the old man's lifelong labor, I have gained a whole body of enthusiasm!"

　　After reading it, I was also moved by this comrade's enthusiasm for promoting art. At this time, the Artists Association was about to hold a workers' symposium for the Qi Baishi posthumous exhibition, so we invited him to participate as well.

　　One evening, more than thirty worker comrades came to the quiet exhibition hall, where Qi Baishi's works after liberation were displayed. Everyone sat in the middle of the bright flowers and peace doves to hold the meeting. We were looking forward to hearing: how would the workers view Qi Baishi?

　　Many comrades said that Qi Baishi was born as a carpenter and grew up in the countryside, just like them, so they felt particularly close to his paintings. They cited a series of works as examples. Liu Tongfeng of the Environmental Sanitation Workers' Union said: "He paints what the people love and are familiar with. The 'Rake' painting, the rake teeth simply have the feeling of bamboo splits, and it is one that is habitually used." Qian Kangling of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry said: "I think the good thing about Qi Baishi's paintings is the word 'truth', and he can paint big or small, simple or complex. I also come from the countryside, and I am familiar with everything he paints. The first time I saw his shrimp at the Peace Painting Store, I couldn't help but touch it with my hand. The more I looked at it, the more real it seemed, transparent and hard. Just like his writing, it is also hard, and his character is also hard-boned, which can be seen from the 'Tumbler' and many other inscriptions." Yang Yuqing of the Xizhimen Railway Club said: "I like Qi Baishi's paintings, they are bold, spirited, and I feel happy in my heart when I look at them!" The workers also loved Qi Baishi's poems. Yang Baoshun of the Workers' Publishing House Printing Factory said: "His poems show that he never forgot that he came from the working people."

　　Regarding the artistic views of the old man Baishi and his lifelong achievements of diligent labor, the workers have this understanding: In the past, some people always thought that Qi Baishi's paintings were just a few strokes, with a trick, but this time, after seeing his early meticulous paintings and drafts in the exhibition, they all realized that any achievement is not easy to come by. The old man's painting table used during his lifetime, which was displayed in the exhibition, also left a deep impression on everyone. Someone said that he carefully looked at the bamboo chair, one leg was repaired, wrapped with rattan, and the rattan had traces of old age. Many people said that they were educated and encouraged by the old man's simple life, the perseverance of hard study, and the spirit of decades of hard work and unremitting pursuit of artistic creation.

　　Liu Yaoling, a retoucher at the 535 Printing Factory, said: "What inspires me the most is the manuscript. He draws drafts on any waste paper, and I saw that many works in the later period used them." He also said: "After understanding Qi Baishi's paintings, I often find his paintings in life, and I find them very familiar and lovely." What a good explanation! It shows that good works of art not only truly reflect life, but also help people understand and love life.

　　However, "How did he learn to paint so well in the first place?" Qiu Yonghong of the Beijing Handmade Knitting and Dyeing Factory said: "I think he has been thinking about painting all the time in his life. ... I think if everyone in our country contributed a lifetime of energy to the people like the old Mr. Qi, how much power would that be combined!"

　　The night grew deeper, and one after another spoke in the bright hall, and everyone's heart was warm. Finally, Wu Nianhai said that he posted the paintings at the construction site, and the master craftsmen all said that the more they looked at them, the more energetic they became, which greatly encouraged production morale. Everyone looked at each picture carefully and said, look how detailed he painted, our work must also be more detailed! Some people also said that the old Mr. Qi was still working at the age of ninety-seven, we really have to work hard. Some master craftsmen feel that they are a little older and point fingers and act like old-timers, which is really wrong.

　　The symposium was over, and I thought all the way that if the old Mr. Qi could hear these words today, he would definitely feel that in his life, only now has he truly returned to his "intimate" crowd.

### 看了白石画，干劲再增加——记工人们的话

    看了白石画，干劲再增加
    ——记工人们的话
  　郁风
    白石老人有一块自刻图章：“吾草木众人也”。这一自白说明了齐白石之所以能够成为伟大的人民艺术家的根本原因。
    在1月24日北京日报上有一篇署名“北京热电站工地油漆徒工吴碾孩”的短文，说他自己为齐白石的作品和一生的艺术劳动所感动，利用了三个上夜班白天休息的机会去苏联展览馆看了三次齐白石遗作展览会。还用他并不富裕的钱买了六十多张复制品画片，回到工地在饭堂开起展览会来，给整个工地的伙伴都看了。还写了快板作说明，又把报纸上的介绍文章剪下来张贴，给贴满了大字报和保证书的工地上增添了火热气氛。他的快板的最后一段写着：
    “我们要当促进派，
    掀起高潮干劲大，
    此时看了白石画，
    千斤干劲再增加！”
    他还在展览会意见簿上写了四句话：“我是一个建筑工人，每天给祖国增添画景，看了老人一生的劳动，增加了我一身的干劲！”
    我看过之后，也被这位同志为艺术作宣传的热情干劲所感动。这时美协正要为齐白石遗作展览召开一次工人座谈会，我们便请他也来参加了。
    一个晚上，三十多位工人同志来到了寂静的展览会场，这里陈列着齐白石解放后的作品，大家就坐在鲜艳的百花与和平鸽中间开会。我们期待着听：工人们会怎样看齐白石呢？
    许多同志都说齐白石出身木工，又从小在农村，和自己一样，所以看他的画特别感到亲切。他们一连串地举出作品当例子。环境卫生处工会刘同丰说：“他画的都是人民喜爱的、熟悉的。那幅‘柴耙’，耙子齿简直有竹劈的感觉，而且是使用惯了的。”第一机械工业部千康龄说：“我觉得齐白石的画的好处就在一个真字，而且能大能小，能简能繁。我也是来自农村的，他画的东西我都熟悉。以前我第一次在和平画店看见他画的虾，禁不住就用手去摸了一下，越看越真，又透明，又是硬的。就像他写的字也是硬的，他的性格也是把硬骨头，从‘不倒翁’和许多别的题词中就看得出来。”西直门铁路俱乐部杨玉青说：“我喜欢齐白石的画，豪放，精神，看着心里就痛快！”对于齐白石的诗，工人也很爱，工人出版社印刷厂杨葆舜说：“从他的诗里表明他一生也没忘记他出身于劳动人民。”
    对于白石老人的艺术观和他的一生勤恳劳动的成就，工人们是这样体会的：过去有人总以为齐白石的画不过是潦潦几笔，有个窍门儿，这次从展览会中看了他早年的工笔画和草稿，都体会到任何成就不是容易得来的。展览会中陈列的老人生前所用画案也给大家留下深刻印象，有人说他仔仔细细看了那张竹椅，有一条腿修补过，缠着藤条，而那藤条上又有了陈久的岁月的痕迹。许多人都说到从老人简朴的生活，艰苦学习的毅力，和几十年的锤炼功夫，不懈的追求艺术创造的精神受到教育和鼓舞。
    五三五印刷厂的修版工人刘耀领说：“给我启发最大的是手稿，随便一张废纸，都画上草稿，看见后期许多作品都利用上了。”他还说：“看懂齐白石的画后，我在生活中就常发现他的画，觉得很熟悉，很可爱。”这是多么好的说明！说明好的艺术品不但是真实的反映生活，而且能够帮助人们理解和热爱生活。
    可是，“他画得这么好，当初是怎么学的呢？”北京手工针织染厂丘永洪说：“我看他这辈子确实是一时一刻都在为画画打主意。……我想我们国家如果每个人都像齐老先生这样给人民贡献一生精力，那合在一起有多么大的力量啊！”
    夜更深沉了，明亮的大厅里一个跟着一个发言，大家心里热呼呼的。最后是吴碾孩，他说他把画贴在工地，老师傅们都说越看越来劲，对生产情绪鼓舞很大。大家一张一张仔细看，说瞧人家画得多细致，咱们的工作也得细致点！也有人说人家齐老先生九十七岁还工作呢，咱们真得好好干活。有的老师傅自己感到年纪稍大些就指手划脚摆老资格，真是不对。
    座谈会散了，我一路想如果齐老先生今天能听到这些话，一定会感到在他一生中只有现在才真正回到了他的“知己”的众人群中。
