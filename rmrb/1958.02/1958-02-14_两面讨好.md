　　Appeasing Both Sides

　　The Washington authorities have been quite uneasy in recent days. They are deeply afraid that the situation of French aircraft bombing peaceful Tunisian villages will escalate. American officials are already worried that the United States will be in an "awkward position" in future discussions in the Security Council. They believe that "no matter how the United States votes, it will offend either France or Tunisia, and if it abstains from voting, it will displease both sides."

　　The United States is clearly supporting the French colonialists, and still hopes to continue playing the trick of appeasing both sides, which of course is very difficult to achieve. It is ridiculous that these American officials actually believe that the United States' supplying France with aircraft to bomb peaceful Tunisian villages has not yet offended the people of Tunisia.

    两面讨好
    华盛顿当局连日以来甚为不安，他们深怕法国飞机狂炸突尼斯和平村庄的事态扩大。美国的官员已担心到在安理会未来的讨论中，美国将处于“为难的地位”。他们认为美国“不论投什么票，总会触怒法国或突尼斯其中一方，如果它在投票的时候弃权，那就会两面都不讨好。”
    美国明明是支持了法国殖民者，还希图继续玩弄两面讨好的把戏，当然是很难办得到的。可笑的是，这些美国官员居然认为美国供给法国飞机狂炸突尼斯和平村庄的所为还没有触怒突尼斯的人民。
