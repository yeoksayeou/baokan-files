Points Out that the Egyptian-Syrian Union is Conducive to Dealing with Aggression and Division
Soviet Union and Fifteen Other Countries Recognize the United Arab Republic
Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 22nd: Egyptian President Nasser said on February 22nd, "Arabs have always been united to deal with aggression and division, because they know that their strength lies in unity, and union is the strength they rely on."

Nasser made these remarks while speaking to 750,000 Egyptian youths at Republic Square in Cairo. This grand gathering was specifically held to hear the results of the Egyptian and Syrian referendums and Nasser's speech.

Nasser said that unity is a weapon, and we can use this weapon to deal with common enemies who have consistently opposed us, divided us, and weakened us.

Nasser denied reports that Egyptian troops had invaded Sudan. He said, "The Egyptian army and the army of the United Arab Republic will never fight against any Arab country, but will always support the Arabs against imperialism and aggression."

Egyptian Interior Minister Mohieddin announced at the meeting that 99.99% of the more than six million Egyptian voters who participated in the referendum on the 21st supported the union of Egypt and Syria and elected Nasser as the president of the United Republic.

Mohieddin also announced the results of the referendum held in Syria, saying that 99.98% of Syrian voters voted in favor of the United Republic and agreed that Nasser should serve as president.

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: TASS Moscow, February 22nd: Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, sent a telegram to Nasser, President of the United Arab Republic.

The telegram stated that the Soviet government has decided to recognize the United Arab Republic as an independent and sovereign country and expresses its willingness to maintain friendly relations with this country, just as it did in the past with Egypt and Syria.

Voroshilov congratulated Nasser on the establishment of the United Arab Republic, congratulated him on his election as President of the Republic, wished him further success, and wished the people of the United Arab Republic prosperity and well-being.
