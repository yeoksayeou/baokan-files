　　Strange "Shift Change Meeting Room"
    The Kailuan Linxi Mechanical Repair Factory recently built a "shift change meeting room." It has a stage for performances and can accommodate a thousand people. Anyone who isn't blind can tell at a glance that this is a club, not some "shift change meeting room."
    The truth of the matter is this: The Linxi Mechanical Repair Factory wanted to build a club in the first half of last year. The Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration, based on the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily and the fact that the Linxi Mine already had two clubs, did not approve it. However, the leaders of the Linxi Mechanical Repair Factory were determined to build a club. They later applied to the Kailuan General Administration, calling it a "shift change meeting room." The Kailuan General Administration actually approved it carelessly. This is really an unacceptable thing!

### 奇怪的“交接班会议室”

　　奇怪的“交接班会议室”
    开滦林西机械制修厂最近盖了一座“交接班会议室”。它有演出用的舞台，容纳得下一千人。只要不是瞎子，一眼就可以看出，这是一座俱乐部，而不是什么“交接班会议室”。
    事情的真相是这样的：林西机械制修厂在去年上半年要建个俱乐部，开滦煤矿总管理处根据勤俭办企业的方针和林西矿已经有两个俱乐部的情况，没有批准。可是林西机械制修厂的领导人员却硬是想盖个俱乐部。只是后来在向开滦总处申请的时候，说成是盖“交接班会议室”。开滦总处居然也就马马虎虎地给批准了。这实在是要不得的事情！
