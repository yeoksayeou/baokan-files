Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 8th: Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong dispatch: At the secretaries' meeting of the Military Armistice Commission held in Kaesong on February 7th, the secretary of the Korean-Chinese side lodged a strong protest with the U.S. side regarding the U.S. armed vessels' intrusion into the territorial waters of the northern part of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the attack on peaceful fishing boats, and the killing, wounding, and abduction of peaceful fishermen.

The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side described the details of the atrocity at the meeting, as follows: At approximately 1:55 AM on January 26th, a U.S. armed vessel equipped with heavy weapons intruded into the waters off the east coast of the Republic, near the islands of Hyongje Rocks within the Korean-Chinese side's area, and attacked peaceful North Korean fishing vessels engaged in fishing, killing and wounding one fisherman each, and abducting four fishermen.

The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out that the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique, on the one hand, continue to violate the armistice agreement, turning South Korea into an American atomic base, and intensifying the tension in Korea. On the other hand, they disrupt the socialist construction and peaceful life of the northern part of the Republic, carrying out malicious hostile acts against the northern part of the Republic. This hostile act perpetrated by the U.S. side is a deliberate and flagrant violation of the armistice agreement.

The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side lodged a strong protest with the U.S. side regarding this incident, and demanded that the U.S. side immediately cease such piratical acts; return the abducted North Korean fishermen, and demanded that the U.S. side be held accountable, severely punish the personnel involved, and guarantee that such incidents will not happen again. The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side also demanded that the U.S. side return all the North Korean fishermen who have been abducted by the U.S. side sending armed personnel to the coastal areas of the east and west coasts of North Korea in the past.

At the meeting, the U.S. side attempted to evade its responsibility for this incident, repeating the absurd arguments of the past. It attempted to slander the Korean-Chinese side.

　　美方武装船只袭击朝鲜渔民
    朝中方面提强硬抗议
    据新华社平壤8日电　朝鲜中央通讯社开城消息：在2月7日在开城举行的军事停战委员会秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长，就美方武装船只侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国北部领海袭击和平渔船并且打死、打伤和劫走和平渔民的暴行，向美方提出强硬的抗议。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上叙述暴行发生的经过，事实如下：1月26日一时五十五分许，一艘装备有重武器的美方武装船只侵入共和国北部东海岸的海面，在朝中方面地区内的岛屿兄弟岩附近，向正在捕鱼的朝鲜北部和平船只进行袭击，打死和打伤渔民各一人，并且劫走渔民四人。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，美帝国主义和李承晚集团一方面继续破坏停战协定，把南朝鲜变成美国的原子基地，加剧朝鲜紧张局势，另一方面又扰乱共和国北部的社会主义建设和和平生活，对共和国北部进行恶毒的敌对行为。这次美方制造的敌对行为是蓄意的、粗暴违反停战协定的行为。
    朝中方面秘书长就这个事件向美方提出了强硬的抗议，并且要求美方立即停止这种海盗行为；送还被劫走的朝鲜北部渔民，同时要求美方负责作出交代，严惩有关人员，保证这类事件不再发生。朝中方面秘书长还要求美方把历次美方派武装人员到朝鲜北部东西海岸沿海劫走的所有的朝鲜北部渔民全部送还。
    美方在会上企图逃避他对这个事件的责任，重复过去说过的谰调，它企图中伤朝中方面。
