Suggestions for Maintaining Peace in Central Europe
By a People's Daily Commentator

The Polish government has sent a memorandum to the governments of relevant countries regarding the establishment of a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone. The Polish government has provided detailed explanations regarding this previously proposed suggestion, clearly outlining the obligations that countries within the Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone, as well as major powers, should bear in this region. It proposes that relevant countries should guarantee the establishment of a supervisory system within the territory of this region, and offers three forms other than the signing of an international treaty, requesting that relevant countries begin negotiations. This memorandum from the Polish government is of positive significance in promoting the realization of the suggestion to establish a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone.

In its initial proposal in December of last year to establish a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone, Poland suggested making Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and West Germany a region free of atomic and hydrogen weapons. This would eliminate the threat of atomic war in a region of Central Europe encompassing over 100 million people, and ease tensions in Central Europe. Everyone knows that the first two World Wars both broke out in this region. Currently, the United States is fully supporting the revival of West German militarism to confront the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, making West Germany a potential source of war once again. Therefore, realizing Poland's suggestion to establish a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone would greatly change the situation in Central Europe, be conducive to improving the overall international atmosphere, promote the resolution of disarmament issues and other international disputes, and transform this potential source of war in Europe into a peaceful region. This is why this suggestion has not only been unanimously supported by socialist countries, but has also received attention from many European countries. Even Britain believes it is a suggestion worth studying. The broad masses of the European people, including the people of West Germany and France, have widely launched movements against the establishment of missile bases and in support of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones.

However, this suggestion has consistently been opposed by the United States and West Germany. The United States even considers this an "extremely dangerous" plan. The U.S. State Department has instructed U.S. embassies in Western European countries to prevent Western European countries from accepting this suggestion. Some countries and their newspapers have also put forward various arguments against it, criticizing Poland's suggestion as not being specific enough, not mentioning the issue of supervision at all, and insisting that Poland's suggestion is only for propaganda purposes, and so on.

The newly proposed memorandum from Poland uses practical actions to answer all well-intentioned questions and refute all malicious distortions. It once again makes it clear to peace-loving people around the world that establishing a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone is a practical and feasible measure that is conducive to promoting world peace. The Chinese people warmly support the Polish government's efforts to further promote the realization of the establishment of a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone, and hope that the governments of relevant countries will accept this suggestion as soon as possible and begin negotiations.

    维护中欧和平的建议
    本报评论员
    波兰政府向有关各国政府发出了关于建立中欧无原子武器区的备忘录。波兰政府就以前提出的这个建议，作了详尽的说明，明确提出了中欧无原子武器区各国以及各大国对这个地区应负的义务，以及有关国家应保证在本地区领土上建立监督体系，提出除了签订国际条约的形式以外的三种别的形式，并要求有关国家着手进行谈判。波兰政府的这个备忘录对于促进中欧建立无原子武器区建议的实现，是有积极意义的。
    波兰在去年12月首倡建立中欧无原子武器区的建议中，提出了使波、捷、民主德国和西德成为无原子武器和氢武器地区，这样，就能在中欧包括一亿多人口的地区上，消除了原子战争的威胁，缓和中欧的紧张局势。谁都知道，前两次世界大战都是从这个地区爆发的，而现在，美国正全力扶植西德军国主义的复活，来对付苏联和其他社会主义国家，使西德又成为当前一个可能的战争策源地。因之，实现波兰关于建立中欧无原子武器区的建议，将会大大改变中欧的形势，有利于改善整个国际气氛，促使裁军问题和其他国际争端的解决，把这个欧洲可能的战争策源地变成一个和平地区。这就是为什么这个建议，不仅为社会主义国家所一致支持，并且得到欧洲许多国家的重视，就连英国也认为这是值得研究的建议。而欧洲广大人民，包括西德和法国人民，更是广泛展开了反对建立火箭基地、拥护建立无原子武器区的运动。
    不过这个建议，一直遭到美国和西德的反对，美国甚至认为这是“极端危险”的计划。美国国务院为此指令美国驻西欧各国的大使馆，阻止西欧国家接受这个建议。而有些国家和它们的报纸，又提出各种各样的反对论调，指责波兰建议不具体，根本没有谈到监督问题，硬说波兰的建议只是为的宣传目的，等等。
    波兰新提出的这一个备忘录，用实际行动解答了一切善意的疑问，也驳斥了一切恶意的歪曲，再一次使全世界爱好和平的人民，了解到建立中欧无原子武器区是切实可行的、有利于促进世界和平的重要措施。中国人民热烈赞助波兰政府进一步促进实现建立中欧无原子武器区的主张，并且希望有关各国政府早日接受这一建议，并且着手谈判。
