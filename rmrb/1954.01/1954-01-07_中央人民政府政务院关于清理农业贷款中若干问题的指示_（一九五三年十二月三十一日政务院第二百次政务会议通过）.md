Under the leadership of people's governments at all levels in recent years, agricultural, water conservancy, People's Bank, supply and marketing cooperative departments at all levels have supplied farmers with a large number of new-style walking plows, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and waterwheels through loans and loans in kind, in order to help farmers develop agricultural production. They have also mobilized and organized farmers to carry out beneficial undertakings such as well-digging, canal-opening, pond-repairing, and dam-building. These measures have played a significant role in improving agricultural production conditions, overcoming natural disasters, and promoting mutual aid and cooperation, and the patriotic production increase movement. The restoration and development of agricultural production in our country, reaching and exceeding the pre-war level, is inseparable from these measures.

However, a small portion of the new-style walking plows, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and waterwheels that have been loaned to farmers are idle and cannot be used. The reason is that we lacked a deep understanding of the actual situation of the small-scale peasant economy when carrying out the above-mentioned work. In particular, the agricultural loan tasks in 1952 were too high and too urgent. There was a lack of preparation and experience, which led to some coercive orders in some places during the implementation process. Some walking plows, waterwheels, pesticides, and agricultural machinery were of poor quality, high prices, and unsuitable for use. The lending work was not combined with technical work such as teaching the masses to use them and helping the masses repair them. A small portion of the farmland water conservancy projects built by farmers with loans were also poorly designed, of poor quality, or abandoned halfway, or although completed, had little benefit or were even unusable. This not only wasted the agricultural loans of the state banks, and farmers did not get the benefits they deserved; but also the principal and interest of this part of agricultural loans are difficult to recover, forming a considerable amount of bad debts. Although the above-mentioned phenomena are a minority of partial shortcomings, and have been significantly improved since the spring of this year, there are still some problems that need to be resolved in order to eliminate the doubts and difficulties of this part of the farmers, thereby actively improving the supply of means of production and further developing agricultural production. Therefore, it has been decided to conduct a rectification of past agricultural loans based on the spirit of seeking truth from facts. Those who have done everything right in the past should carry forward their achievements and continue; those who have basically done right, but only have some shortcomings, should affirm their achievements and correct their shortcomings; and those who have done a few things wrong should resolutely correct them. Only by clearly drawing a line and carrying out rectification can farmers get real benefits, reduce state losses, and lay a good foundation for future agricultural loans. The following are the principles for rectification:

I. For new-style farm tools, agricultural machinery, and waterwheels loaned to farmers that are in good use and have achieved results, farmers should be encouraged to make more effective use of them. For those that basically meet the conditions of use but are shelved because the masses do not understand the technology, technical guidance should be actively carried out to teach the masses how to use the technology. For those that need to be repaired due to poor quality, the original sales unit should repair them free of charge. For those that have been shelved and unused due to lack of spare parts, the original sales unit should equip them with parts free of charge. However, those that need to be repaired due to damage caused by use cannot be exempted from fees. If farmers have borrowed such new-style farm tools and other physical objects and have been shelved and unused for the above reasons, and the loans have not been repaid, interest will not be charged during the period when the physical objects are shelved, and the loans should be repaid as stipulated. If the quality of the borrowed physical objects is not good and the price is too high, and the original price should be appropriately reduced, the loans should be repaid according to the reduced amount.

II. For new-style farm tools, agricultural machinery, and waterwheels loaned to farmers, if they do not have the conditions for use or are of such poor quality that they cannot be repaired, or if the farmers really do not want to use them, they should be taken back by the original physical supply department, and the farmers' debts should be relieved, and interest should not be charged. However, if some are not suitable for use locally but can be used in another area, they should be sold elsewhere after being taken back.

III. For permanent wells, canals, ponds, dams, and weirs built by farmers with loans, if the benefits are minimal and the farmers are unable to repay the principal and interest of the loans, a portion of the loans and interest can be reduced or recovered depending on the circumstances. If there are no benefits at all, or if the projects have been destroyed by natural disasters such as mountain floods, the loans may no longer be recovered, and interest will not be charged, and the farmers will be relieved of the debts owed on the loans.

IV. If the pesticides loaned out have not been used by farmers because they do not understand the technology, and the farmers request to return them, or if they are still shelved in the district and township governments, they should be taken back, and the farmers' debts should be relieved, and interest should not be charged. After the recovery, those that are still effective should be properly preserved by the original loan and sales department. Those that have expired should be scrapped.

V. Except for the loans that should be reduced or exempted in accordance with the above-mentioned rectification principles, other agricultural loans granted to farmers should be repaid on time in accordance with the original agreement. If there are indeed difficulties in repayment, they should be handled in accordance with the bank's regulations on clearing general loans.

Each province may formulate specific implementation measures in accordance with the above-mentioned rectification principles, and under the unified leadership of the local people's government's financial committee, the agricultural, water conservancy, banking, and supply and marketing cooperative departments and other relevant departments shall conduct the rectification separately. This rectification work should preferably be carried out in conjunction with the spring plowing production work in 1954, and through this rectification work, the supply of agricultural means of production and the issuance of agricultural loans should be further improved. Some areas that are unable to rectify in the spring of 1954 may postpone it, but it must be completed within 1954. Failure to rectify it for a long time will be detrimental to the supply of agricultural means of production and agricultural loan work in the future.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于清理农业贷款中若干问题的指示
    （一九五三年十二月三十一日政务院第二百次政务会议通过）
    几年来，在各级人民政府领导下，各级农业、水利、人民银行、供销合作社等部门为了扶助农民发展农业生产，曾以贷款、贷实等办法供应了农民大量的新式步犁、农药、农械和水车，并发动和组织农民进行了凿井、开渠、修塘、筑堰等有益事业。这些措施，对于改善农业生产条件，战胜自然灾害和推进互助合作、爱国增产运动，是起了很大作用的。我国农业生产的恢复和发展，达到并且超过了抗日战争前的水平，与这些措施也是分不开的。
    但是已经贷放到农民手里的新式步犁、农药、农械和水车，其中也有一小部分闲置未能使用。其原因是由于在进行上述工作时对小农经济的现实状况缺乏深刻的认识，特别是一九五二年的农贷任务要求过高过急，既缺乏准备，又缺乏经验，以致有些地方在推行工作中发生了一些强迫命令现象；由于有些步犁、水车、农药、农械质量差、价格高、不合用，贷放工作又未能和教会群众使用、帮助群众修理等技术工作相结合。农民贷款兴修的农田水利工程，也有一小部分是设计不周，质量不好，或者中途废工，或者虽已完工但效益很小甚至不能使用。这不仅浪费了国家银行的农业贷款，农民未得到应得的实惠；而且这一部分农业贷款的本息也难以收回，形成相当数量的呆账。上述现象虽属少数的部分的缺点，今年春季以来并已有了显著的改进，但仍留有若干问题需要加以解决，以消除这一部分农民的疑难，从而积极改进生产资料的供应工作，更进一步地发展农业生产。因此决定对过去的农贷，根据实事求是的精神，进行一次清理工作。过去完全做对了的，应该发扬成绩，继续进行；基本上做对了、只是有些缺点的，应该肯定成绩，纠正缺点；少数做错了的，则应坚决纠正。这样划清界线，实行清理，才能使农民得到实惠，减少国家损失，并为今后发放农业贷款奠定良好的基础。兹规定清理的几条原则如下：
    一、贷到农民手中的新式农具、农械和水车，凡使用良好已著成效者，应继续推动农民更有效地加以利用；凡基本上具备使用条件，但因群众不懂技术而被搁置者，应积极进行技术指导，教会群众使用技术；其因质量不好须加修理方能使用者，应由原推销单位免费修理；其因缺乏配件，始终搁置未用者，应由原推销单位无代价地为之装配零件，但因使用损坏需要修配者，不能援例免费。农民贷到这种新式农具等实物因上述原因而搁置未用，贷款亦未清偿者，实物搁置期间免计利息，贷款应按规定归还。如所贷实物的质量不好，价格过高，应适当降低原价者，贷款应按减价后的数目归还。
    二、贷到农民手中的新式农具、农械和水车，其中如有根本不具备使用条件或质量太坏无法修理者，或农民确实不愿使用者，应由原实物供应部门收回，解除农民债务，并免收利息。但有的在当地虽不适用而在另一地区尚能使用者，应于收回后易地出售。
    三、农民贷款兴修之带永久性的水井、渠、塘、坝、堰，其中如有效益甚少，农民无力偿还贷款本息者，可斟酌情况减少收回一部分贷款和利息；其中如有完全无效益者，或因山洪等自然灾害所修工程已遭毁坏者，贷款可不再收回，并免计利息，解除农民对此项贷款所负的债务。
    四、贷出的农药因农民不懂技术，至今未予使用，农民要求退回或至今仍搁置在区乡政府者，均应收回，解除农民所负的债务，并免计利息。收回后其仍有效用者，应由原贷售部门妥为保存。其已失效用者，应予报废。
    五、除按照上述清理原则应予减免之贷款外，贷给农民的其他农业贷款，均应依原约定如期归还本息；归还确有困难者，则按银行所规定之清理一般贷款的办法处理。
    各省可根据上述清理的原则拟定本省的具体实施办法，在当地人民政府财委的统一领导之下，由农业、水利、银行和供销合作社等有关部门分别进行清理。此项清理工作最好结合一九五四年春耕生产工作进行，并通过此项清理工作来更进一步地改进农业生产资料的供应工作和农业贷款的发放工作。有的地区，在一九五四年春季不及清理者，可以推迟，但必须于一九五四年内结束，长期不予清理，对今后的农业生产资料的供应和农贷工作都是不利的。
