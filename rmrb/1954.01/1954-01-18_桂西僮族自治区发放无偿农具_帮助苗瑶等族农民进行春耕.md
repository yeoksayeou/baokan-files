    Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region Distributes Free Farm Tools
    Helping Miao, Yao, and Other Ethnic Farmers with Spring Plowing
      【Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 16th】 In the Baise Special District of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in Guangxi Province, over 57,000 pieces of free farm tools will be distributed to Miao, Yao, and other ethnic minority farmers to aid in spring plowing and production. The Miao, Yao, and other ethnic minority people in the Baise Special District number approximately 179,000, most of whom reside in remote mountainous areas. They have little land, many mountains, a lack of farm tools, backward production techniques, and impoverished living conditions. In order to assist these ethnic minority farmers in changing their backward state of "slash-and-burn cultivation" and "broadcast sowing with meager harvests" and to improve production, the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government has allocated a special relief fund of 3.2 billion yuan this year, including 1.32 billion yuan for farm tools. After the Baise Special District converted the funds into farm implements and distributed them to various locations based on actual needs, each county has sent specialized personnel deep into the ethnic minority farming communities to investigate the specifications and weights of the farm tools, and is organizing iron factories and blacksmith shops to manufacture the tools locally according to their preferred styles.

    桂西僮族自治区发放无偿农具
    帮助苗瑶等族农民进行春耕
      【新华社南宁十六日电】在广西省桂西僮族自治区百色专区，将有五万七千多件无偿农具分发给苗、瑶等族农民，以进行春耕生产。百色专区苗、瑶等少数民族人民约十七万九千多人，大都居住在偏远高山地区，田少山多，缺乏农具，生产技术落后，生活贫困。桂西僮族自治区人民政府为了扶助这些少数民族农民改变“刀耕火种”、“广播薄收”的落后状态，提高生产，今年特地拨发了三十二亿元救济费，其中农具费一十三亿二千万元。百色专区根据实际需要，将款项折合农具件数分发各地以后，各县已派专人深入少数民族农民中调查农具的规格、重量，按照他们喜爱的式样，就地组织铁工厂、铁匠炉制造农具。
