Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: In 1953, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Albania made significant achievements in cultural and welfare undertakings.

    In 1953, Poland had a total of 85 higher education institutions, more than three times the number before the war, with over 130,000 students, more than 1.7 times the number before the war. Seven-year schools have greatly increased. By the end of 1953, the number of seven-year schools in the country had increased by 3,700 compared to 1949. There are now nearly 13,700 seven-year schools in Poland's agricultural areas, three times the number before the war. Before the war, there was only one school for every seventeen villages in Poland; now there is one for every four villages. The provinces that were the most backward under the rule of the bourgeoisie and landlords had the largest number of seven-year schools opened in 1953. For example, Lublin Province opened 84 new seven-year schools, bringing the total number of seven-year schools in the province to nearly 1,000 (compared to only 305 before the war). All farmers' children can attend school. In the era of bourgeois and landlord rule, there were no libraries, clubs, or cinemas in the Polish countryside. But by 1953, there were about 3,000 township libraries, about 25,000 village libraries, more than 10,000 rural clubs, more than 1,200 rural cinemas, and more than 200 film projection teams nationwide. Each township had an average of three libraries.
    Czechoslovakia spent 22.3 billion crowns (Czech currency) on social and cultural measures in 1953, accounting for 25.3% of the total national expenditure. The number of higher education institutions has increased from 9 in the 1936-1937 academic year to 32 in 1953, the number of departments has increased from 33 to 104, and the number of students has increased by two and a half times. The number of students in various specialized schools has almost doubled since 1949. There are more than 76,000 students in national labor reserve schools, and more than 18,000 students are studying in various correspondence schools. The government pays great attention to healthcare. Expenditures in this area have increased to 3.7 times that of 1950 in 1953. In 1953, the number of beds in hospitals and maternity hospitals increased to 86,874 (only 50,868 in 1937). In 1953, the capacity of nurseries had increased to 24 times that of 1937.
    In Bulgaria, 80,000 illiterate people learned to read and write in the 1952-1953 academic year. Since the establishment of the people's regime, more than 667,000 illiterate and semi-literate people have learned to read and write or improved their cultural level. Currently, there are more than 17,000 illiterate people and 32,000 semi-literate people studying in literacy classes. There is now no village in Bulgaria without a school. In the nine years since liberation, Bulgaria has built 750 new schools. There are now five agricultural higher education institutions alone, which can train thousands of agricultural specialists every year; there are 26 agricultural technical schools. The number of higher education institutions nationwide has tripled compared to before the war.
    By 1953, Albania had implemented universal primary education throughout the country and was gradually implementing a seven-year compulsory education system. In 1953, the number of students in seven-year schools nationwide increased by 25% compared to 1952, the number of students in secondary schools increased by 20%, and the number of students in higher education institutions increased by 50%. Many literacy classes have been held in cities and villages throughout Albania. In 1953, 68,000 working people were studying in literacy classes. It is expected that illiteracy can be basically eliminated nationwide in 1954. Since the establishment of the people's regime, Albania has established more than 1,200 cultural and educational institutions such as clubs, libraries, and cultural palaces. In 1953, a total of nearly 2.75 million books were published, an increase of 50 times compared to 1938.

    波捷保阿等国文化福利事业发展很快
    【新华社六日讯】一九五三年，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚在文化和福利事业方面取得了显著的成就。
    一九五三年波兰的高等学校总共有八十五所，比战前增加了两倍多；学生十三万多人，比战前增加了一点七倍以上。七年制学校已经大大增加。到一九五三年年底，全国的七年制学校比一九四九年增加了三千七百所。现在波兰农业地区共有将近一万三千七百所七年制学校，即增为战前的三倍。战前波兰每十七个乡村只有一所学校，现在每四个乡村就有一所。过去资产阶级和地主统治时期最落后的省份，在一九五三年内开办七年制学校的数目最多，例如卢布林省就开设了八十四所新的七年制学校，全省七年制学校的总数已增加到将近一千所（战前只有三百零五所）。所有的农民子女都能进学校读书。在资产阶级和地主统治时代，波兰的乡村根本没有图书馆、俱乐部和电影院。但到一九五三年，全国约有三千个乡图书馆，约二万五千个村图书馆，一万多个农村俱乐部，一千二百多个农村电影院和二百多个电影放映队。每一个乡平均有三个图书馆。
    捷克斯洛伐克一九五三年用于社会文化措施方面的经费有二百二十三亿克朗（捷币名），占国家总支出的百分之二十五点三。高等学校已从一九三六—一九三七学年的九所增加到一九五三年的三十二所，学系从三十三系增加到一百零四系，学生人数增加到两倍半。各专门学校的学生比一九四九年几乎增加了一倍。国家劳动后备学校中共有七万六千多名学生，此外还有一万八千多个学生在各种函授学校中学习。政府对于保健事业非常注意。一九五三年用于这方面的经费已增加为一九五○年的三点七倍。一九五三年病院和产科医院的床位增加到八万六千八百七十四个（一九三七年只有五万零八百六十八个）。一九五三年托儿所的收容额已增加为一九三七年的二十四倍。
    保加利亚在一九五二—一九五三学年，就有八万文盲学会了读书和写字。自人民政权建立以来，有六十六万七千多个文盲和粗通文字的人学会了读书写字或提高了文化水平。目前在扫除文盲班学习的有一万七千多文盲和三万二千粗通文字的人。现在保加利亚没有一个乡村没有学校。解放九年来，保加利亚已建立了七百五十所新学校。现在单是农业高等学校就有五个，每年可培养数千名农业专门人材；农业技术学校有二十六个。全国高等学校的数目比战前增加了三倍。
    阿尔巴尼亚到一九五三年已在全国实施了普及初等教育制，并逐步实施七年义务教育制。一九五三年全国七年制学校的学生比一九五二年增加了百分之二十五，中等学校的学生增加了百分之二十，高等学校学生增加了百分之五十。阿尔巴尼亚的各个城市和乡村都举办了许多扫除文盲班。一九五三年就有六万八千个劳动人民在扫除文盲班内学习。预计在一九五四年全国就可以基本上消灭文盲。自人民政权建立以来，阿尔巴尼亚已成立了一千二百多个俱乐部、图书馆、文化宫等文化教育机关。一九五三年共出版了将近二百七十五万册书籍，即增加为一九三八年的五十倍。
