Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 14th: The Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany held a press conference in Berlin on the 11th, exposing a new conspiracy by spy organizations directed by US imperialism to provoke the German Democratic Republic.

The Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Nuschke, delivered a report at the meeting on the activities of American and West German spy organizations. He emphasized that as the Four-Power Conference is about to be held, these conspiracies of US imperialism must be seen as an attempt to continue to poison the atmosphere and further cause people to doubt whether the Four-Power Conference can be successfully conducted.

Otto Nuschke said that according to reliable intelligence, the secret agencies of the United States and the West German organizations acting on their instructions are currently preparing to launch a new provocation against the German Democratic Republic. Bruno Siegfried Kranz (who has been arrested), a spy belonging to the Gehlen spy organization of former Hitler general Gehlen, confessed during interrogation that after the failure of the June provocation, Gehlen spy organization members Paul Boerg and Moeser said in his presence: Preparations have been made to launch a new provocation against the German Democratic Republic in March 1954. According to his confession, a meeting was held in Frankfurt am Main (US-occupied zone) last October to discuss all the details of this new provocation. Attendees included liaison officers from the occupying forces, representatives of the Bonn government, leaders of Western secret service and terrorist organizations, and representatives of the "Eastern Bureaus" of the Free Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Union, and the Social Democratic Party. The meeting was chaired by Bonn Minister Jakob Kaiser.

Nuschke also cited many American spy centers operating in West Germany and West Berlin, which directed espionage and divisive activities against the German Democratic Republic.

The confessions prove that these spy organizations are trying to weaken the German Democratic Republic economically and politically in order to eventually overthrow the democratic government. In order to create the preconditions for merging the German Democratic Republic into the Federal Republic, they spread slanderous propaganda to arouse dissatisfaction among the people of the German Democratic Republic towards the government.

Otto Nuschke concluded by saying: All honest Germans demand an end to the activities of spy and terrorist organizations and an end to all other activities hostile to the German Democratic Republic. This will remove a serious obstacle to the reunification of Germany and help ease international tensions and defend peace in Europe.

After Nuschke's speech, the reporters attending the meeting were invited to visit the evidence of the spy organizations that had been cracked, which was displayed in the adjacent room, including transceivers, explosives, and potent poison prepared for the spies to take upon arrest.

    民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团举行记者招待会
    揭露美国指使西德特务发动挑衅的新阴谋
    【新华社十四日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林十二日讯：民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团十一日在柏林举行记者招待会，揭露美帝国主义指使的间谍组织对德意志民主共和国挑衅的新阴谋。
    德意志民主共和国副总理奥托·努舍克在会上作了一个关于美国与西德间谍组织活动的报告，他强调指出，在四国会议即将举行时，必须把美帝国主义这些阴谋看作是为了继续毒化气氛，企图进一步引起人们怀疑四国会议能否成功地进行。
    奥托·努舍克说，根据可靠的情报，美国的秘密机关以及按照它们的指示行动的西德组织，目前正在准备对德意志民主共和国发动一次新的挑衅。属于前希特勒的将领盖伦的间谍组织的一个间谍分子布鲁诺·西格弗里德·克朗茨（已被逮捕），在受审问的时候招供说，在六月挑衅失败以后，盖伦间谍组织的成员保罗柏格和莫塞尔当着他的面说：已经准备在一九五四年三月对德意志民主共和国发动一次新的挑衅。根据他的供词，去年十月在美因河畔法兰克福（美占区）举行了一次会议，会上讨论了关于这次新的挑衅的一切细节。出席这次会议的有占领军方面的联络官、波恩政府的代表、西方特务与恐怖组织的领导者以及自由民主党、基督教民主联盟和社会民主党的“东方局”的代表。会议是由波恩部长雅各布·凯撒主持的。
    努舍克并举出了许多在西德和西柏林活动的美国间谍中心，这些间谍中心指导进行反对德意志民主共和国的间谍与分裂活动。
    供词证明，这些间谍组织力图从经济上和政治上来削弱德意志民主共和国以便最后推翻民主政府。为了创造把德意志民主共和国合并到联邦共和国中去的先决条件，它们散布诽谤性的宣传以引起德意志民主共和国人民对政府的不满。
    奥托·努舍克最后说：所有正直的德国人都要求停止间谍与恐怖组织的活动和停止其他一切敌视德意志民主共和国的活动。这将消除德国重新统一的一个严重障碍，有助于缓和国际紧张局势和保卫欧洲和平。
    努舍克讲话后，出席会议的记者们被邀参观了陈列在邻室的已被破获的间谍组织的证据，其中有收发报机、炸药以及准备间谍在被捕时服用的烈性毒药。
