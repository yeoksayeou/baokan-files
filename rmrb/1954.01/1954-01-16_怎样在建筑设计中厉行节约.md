    Practicing economy is an important method for the country to accumulate construction funds. Therefore, practicing economy in design should be a principle that our design workers constantly adhere to. Of course, practicing economy in capital construction must also include construction and materials departments, but if the design itself violates the principle of economy, even if the construction and materials departments do a good job of saving, they cannot make up for the losses caused by wasteful design. Because the design directly stipulates the scope and progress of construction, materials, and other work. For example, some buildings could have used a mixed structure, but the design mistakenly used a reinforced concrete frame structure. This not only delayed the design and construction time, but also increased the cost of the civil construction part by about one-third. Such things show that the impact of design on the economy is often much greater than that of construction and materials.

    Capital construction is a major plan for a hundred years. Whether the design is economical or not is not only related to the cost of the construction period, but more importantly, its impact will continue for a long time with the existence of the building. For example, a good factory design can shorten transportation lines and connect operation processes due to reasonable configuration, so that the factory can save money in long-term production. An unreasonable factory design will produce the opposite result.

  Correctly Recognize the Principle of Economy in Design
    To practice economy in design, we must first clarify some confused ideas in this regard. There are often two biases in design: one is to demand that standards be raised as high as possible without focusing on key points, regardless of whether there are sufficient conditions at present, resulting in serious waste; the other is to advocate simplifying everything and making it crude to an unreasonable extent, which not only affects long-term interests but also hinders necessary future development, which is not economical in the long run. Both of these extremes are the result of failing to combine the country's current situation with future development.

    Some comrades also put the quality conditions of "suitability," "durability," and "aesthetics" in design in opposition to economy, believing that "if you talk about economy, you should talk less about suitability and durability, and aesthetics are even out of the question." This one-sided view is obviously wrong. "Suitability" and "durability" are the most basic conditions for building quality, and they are also prerequisites for "economy." If a house saves on construction to the extent that it is unsuitable, insufficient, affects hygiene, affects work, or saves on structure to the extent that it affects safety, or saves on materials to the extent that it affects durability, then this design is not economical at all, but is the biggest waste. Secondly, there is no fundamental contradiction between "economy" and "aesthetics." Simple and unadorned beauty does not necessarily cost more money, and extravagance and waste are not necessarily beautiful, because the beauty of architecture cannot be achieved by simply piling up and creating things.

    Some comrades also often put "concern for people" in design in opposition to economy, believing that since we want to care for people, we will inevitably spend more money. This view is also one-sided, because caring for people in design does not necessarily cost a lot of money, and wasteful designs are not necessarily very caring for people. For example, we found that the stairwells of staff and family dormitories have some different functions from those of general houses. They are not used for internal traffic during work, but are the only way for each household to communicate with the outside world. Therefore, we decided to remove the radiator panels that have always been installed in the stairwells, so that the temperature of the stairwells is between indoor and outdoor, and people entering and exiting will not catch a cold due to sudden cold or heat in winter. This is very caring for people, and at the same time saves the cost of installing radiator panels in the stairwells. Calculating from the more than 460 stairwells in the two residential areas we recently designed, we saved more than 700 million yuan.

    Consider the issue of economy comprehensively and holistically
    The economy of architectural design cannot be achieved by simply reducing the building area or lowering the standard of materials. Often, a building with a compact floor plan and simple materials may not be able to reduce the cost of the building due to the waste of structural calculations or the irrationality of equipment design. Because the design of a modern building includes many professional parts, we must pay attention to economy in architecture, structure, water and heating, electricity, and other aspects. Not only that, but other aspects such as straight outer walls are more economical than tortuous outer walls; simple structural layouts are more economical than complex ones; reasonable structural spans are more economical than spans that are too large or too small; and concentrated sanitary equipment is more economical than decentralized ones. Therefore, these issues must be considered in advance in architectural design. If uneconomical arrangements are made in architectural design regarding structure and equipment, no matter how economical the design of other professional fields is, it cannot remedy the waste caused by unreasonable architectural arrangements, just as focusing on economy from the construction and materials departments cannot remedy the waste in design.

    Some designs do take all aspects into consideration for individual buildings. However, in the overall layout design, no attention is paid to saving land, resulting in not only wasting land, but also increasing the cost of water and sewage pipes, external heating pipes, roads, and power lines, which seriously affects the overall budget of capital construction. In order to practice economy in design, not only must individual houses comprehensively consider problems in the preliminary design stage, but also must comprehensively consider problems in the sketch stage of the overall layout design.

    Another key point of practicing economy in design is that we should consider construction and materials. In terms of materials, we should first understand the national policy and the supply of materials, as well as the market price, whether there are goods, etc. Otherwise, it will be wasteful if cheaper materials are not used and more expensive ones are used. Or, if the specifications specify materials that are simply not available for the time being, the result is that other materials are temporarily used, which are not only more expensive, but also delay construction. In addition, it is also very necessary to use local materials. For example, using stones to build walls in stone-producing areas is much cheaper than using brick walls. We should also pay attention to fully utilizing materials and avoiding using large materials for small purposes, using long materials for short purposes, and using good materials for inferior purposes. At the same time, when designing doors and windows, we should also consider the available sizes of wood, and when designing rainwater pipes, we should consider the size of each sheet of lead and iron, so that all materials can be used to their maximum effect without wasting a single bit.

    Overcome conservative thinking, use your brains more, and calculate carefully
    To practice economy in design, we must overcome conservative thinking, use our brains at all times, and calculate carefully everywhere. Some designers often unconsciously stick to conventions and do not know that as long as they use their brains a little more in design, they can save the country a lot of wealth. For example, when we designed a high-rise building, we originally installed screens on all doors and windows according to the design of ordinary houses. However, after carefully studying how high mosquitoes and flies can fly, we canceled the screens on the upper floors that mosquitoes and flies generally cannot reach, thereby reducing some costs.

    The above example shows that we must calculate carefully in design. We must calculate in large areas, and we must not relax in small areas. On the other hand, we must calculate detailed accounts, and we must calculate total accounts even more. Sometimes it seems like we have saved a little at first glance, but when we calculate the total account, it is not worth the loss. For example, in order to deduct the building area, someone hollowed out a small piece of a square plane, thinking that they could save the cost of this small piece of building area, but when they calculated the total account, the cost of the increased external wall area exceeded the saved roof.

    Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is an important way to save money
    To practice economy in design, we must further learn and promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union more modestly and in more depth. The superiority of Soviet design technology is also reflected in economy. We have benefited greatly since learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. For example, in the design of reinforced concrete, because we adopted the calculation of the advanced plastic theory of the Soviet Union, a certain hospital project alone saved 233 tons of steel bars and 1,309 cubic meters of concrete, worth more than 3 billion yuan. In addition, using the Soviet concrete weight ratio instead of the previous volume ratio can save two bags of cement per cubic meter of concrete.

    The motherland is advancing along the road of economic construction. We architectural design workers must realize that the task we shoulder for national construction is serious and arduous. A decision, a consideration, a few more lines on the drawing, a few less words in the specification, the money saved or wasted is often equivalent to the income of dozens or hundreds of farmers for several years or even decades. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, we must strive to improve our political and ideological level and professional ability, improve design quality, practice economy, and contribute more to the realization of national industrialization.

    怎样在建筑设计中厉行节约
    北京市建筑工程局设计院总工程师　张开济

    节约是国家积累建设资金的重要方法。因此，在设计中厉行节约，应该是我们设计工作者经常坚持不懈的原则。当然，在基本建设中实行节约，还必须包括施工与材料部门，但如果设计本身违反了节约原则，那么施工与材料部门即使把节约工作做得如何好，也不能弥补因设计浪费而造成的损失。因为设计直接规定了施工、材料等工作的范围和进程。例如有些建筑物本来可以用混合结构的，设计时却错误地采用了钢筋混凝土骨架结构，这样不但拖延了设计和施工的时日，而且使土建部分造价增高约三分之一。像这类事情都说明了，设计对经济方面的影响，往往要比施工和材料方面大得多。
    基本建设是百年大计，设计是否节约，不仅关系到建造时期的费用，更重要的是它的影响将随着建筑物的存在而长期延续下去。例如一个良好的工厂设计，由于合理地配置，可以使运输线路缩短，操作过程衔接，使工厂在长期生产中能够节约。而一个不合理的工厂设计，就会产生完全相反的结果。
  正确地认识设计中的节约原则
    要在设计中实行节约，首先需要澄清一些这方面的混乱思想。设计中常有两种偏向：一种是无重点地要求把标准提得越高越好，不顾目前是否有足够的条件，结果造成了严重的浪费；另一种是主张一切因陋就简，简陋到不合理的程度，结果不仅影响了长久利益，也妨碍了将来必要的发展，算起总账来并不经济。这两种极端都是没有把国家目前的状况与将来的发展结合起来考虑的结果。
    还有些同志把设计中的“合用”、“坚固”、
  “美观”等质量条件和节约对立起来；认为“要谈节约就少谈合用及坚固，美观更是谈不到了”，这种片面看法显然是错误的。“合用”和“坚固”是建筑质量中最起码的条件，也是“经济”的先决条件，一所房屋在建筑方面节省到了不合用、不够用、影响卫生、影响工作的程度，在结构方面节省到了影响安全的程度，在用料方面节省到了影响耐久的程度时，这个设计不但谈不上经济，相反地是最大的浪费。其次，“节约”和“美观”也没有基本的矛盾，简单朴素的美不一定要多花钱，而铺张浪费不一定就美，因为建筑的美并不是一味堆砌造作所能达到的。
    也有些同志往往把设计中“对人的关怀”和节约对立起来，认为既然要对人关怀，就不免多花些钱。这种看法也是片面的，因为在设计中对人的关怀，不一定要多花很多钱，而浪费的设计也不一定就对人很关怀。例如，我们发现职工家属宿舍的楼梯间与一般房屋的楼梯间作用有些不同，它不是供内部工作时交通之用，而是屋内各户对外交通必经之道，因此决定把历来装置在楼梯间内的暖气炉片省去，使楼梯间的温度介于室内和户外之间，出入的人在冬天不致因骤冷或骤热而感冒，这样做对人很关怀，同时也节省了楼梯间内一笔暖气炉片装置费。以我们最近设计的两个住宅区的四百六十多间楼梯间来计算，就节省了七亿多元。
    要全面地、综合地考虑节约问题
    建筑设计的节约，不是依靠单纯削减建筑面积，或降低用料标准所能达到的，往往一所平面布置得很紧凑、用料很朴实的建筑物，却很可能因为结构计算的浪费，设备设计的不合理，影响到建筑物的造价不能减低。因为一个现代建筑物的设计包括许多专业部分。必须在建筑结构、水暖、电气等多方面来注意节约。不仅如此，其他如外墙平直的，就比外墙曲折的经济；结构布局简单的就比复杂的经济；结构跨度合理的就比跨度太大或太小的经济；卫生设备集中的就比分散的经济；所以这些问题在建筑设计中就必须事先考虑好，如果在建筑设计中做了关于结构及设备等不合经济的布置，其余各专业设计本身无论怎样的经济，也补救不了因建筑布置不合理而造成的浪费，正如单方面从施工和材料部门的讲求经济不能补救设计上的浪费一样。
    有些设计对于个别建筑物确是各方面都考虑到了。但是在总平面设计中却毫不注意用地的节省，结果不但浪费了土地，而且上下水道、暖气外管、道路，电线等造价都随之增加，因而严重地影响基本建设的总预算。为了在设计中厉行节约，不仅个体房屋在初步设计阶段要全面考虑问题，而且必须在总平面设计的草图阶段就全面考虑问题。
    设计中厉行节约的另一重点，就是应该考虑到施工和用料。在用料方面，首先应该了解国家政策和材料供应的情况，以及市价高低、货色有无等，否则有便宜的材料不用，用了贵的，就造成浪费。或者说明书中用上了根本一时买不到的材料，结果临时改用其他材料，不但价格较贵，而且延误施工。此外就地取材也是非常必要的。例加在产石区利用石块砌墙就比用砖墙便宜得多，还应注意充分利用材料，避免大材小用，长材短用，优材劣用。同时在设计门窗时也应考虑到木材的现成尺寸，设计雨水管时应该考虑每一张铅铁的大小，务使所有物资能够发挥最大作用而不使之有一丝一毫的浪费。
    克服保守思想，多动脑筋，精打细算
    在设计中实行节约，必须克服保守思想，时时开动脑筋，处处精打细算。有些设计人员往往不自觉地墨守成规，不知道在设计中只要多动一下脑筋，就可以替国家节省许多财富。例如我们在设计某一高层建筑时，原来按一般房屋设计，把所有门窗都安上了纱窗纱门。但是后来仔细研究了蚊蝇究竟能飞多高，便把一般情形下蚊蝇飞不到的上面几层的纱窗取消了，因而减低了一些造价。
    上述例子说明了在设计中必须精打细算，大处固然要算，小处也不可放松。另一方面，细账固然要算，总账更是要算。有时候初看好像省了一些，一算总账却是得不偿失。例如有人为了扣建筑面积，把一个方整的平面镂去了一小块，以为可以节省这一小块建筑面积的造价，可是一算总账，所增加的外墙面积造价超出了所节省的屋顶。
    学习苏联先进经验是节约的重要门径
    要在设计中厉行节约，必须进一步更虚心更深入地学习和推广苏联先进经验。苏联设计技术的优越性也表现在节约方面。我们自学习苏联先进经验后收效很大。如钢筋混凝土设计因为采用了苏联先进的塑性理论的计算，仅某医院一个工程，即节省铁筋二三三吨，混凝土一三○九立方公尺，共值三十余亿元。此外，采用苏联的混凝土重量比代替以往的体积比，每立方公尺的混凝土可以节省两袋水泥。
    祖国正在沿着经济建设的道路前进，我们建筑设计工作者必须认识到我们对国家建设所肩负的任务是严重而艰巨的，我们的一个决定，一个考虑，图样上多划了几根线，说明书上少写几个字，所节约或浪费的金钱，其数字往往相等于数十个或数百个农民几年，甚至几十年的收入。因此，我们必须在党的领导下，努力提高自己的政治思想水平和业务能力，提高设计质量，厉行节约，为实现国家工业化贡献更大的力量。
