Southwest District Cooperatives Inspect Supply of Spring Ploughing Production Materials

　　Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the Southwest District are actively preparing to supply materials for spring ploughing. The planned supply of production materials for the entire district in the first quarter of this year is 128.99 percent of that in the fourth quarter of last year. Agricultural tools alone are worth more than 130 billion yuan.

　　The Southwest District Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives issued instructions on December 16 last year regarding the inspection of the preparation for the supply of spring ploughing production materials. The Sichuan Provincial Federation of Cooperatives and others have sent working groups to lower-level cooperatives for inspection. At present, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the Southwest District are generally conducting production and sales surveys and actively organizing sources of goods. Some cooperatives in some areas have also expanded their plans for supplying spring ploughing production materials. The plan of Luxian County Cooperative Union in Sichuan Province to supply production materials originally accounted for only 13 percent of the total retail plan, but has now been expanded to 20 percent. Cooperatives in areas with concentrated iron, bamboo, and wood industries in Changshou County have begun to sign purchase and sales contracts with handicraftsmen after investigating production and sales conditions. The No. 7 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the county has signed four purchase and sales contracts with handicraftsmen, ordering more than 28,000 pieces of bamboo and wood agricultural tools and implements. The No. 8 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Leshan County plans to operate 107 kinds of production materials, an increase of about 47 kinds compared with last year. The supply amount is 223.3 percent of last year, and the average supply of production materials per agricultural population is worth about 26,000 yuan. The Kang Province Cooperative Union plans to supply 125,000 pieces of old-style agricultural tools in the first quarter of this year, and has a considerable reserve. At present, the plans of some supply and marketing cooperatives in the Southwest District to supply production materials are too small, and some cooperatives have not actively prepared spring ploughing production materials. These shortcomings should be corrected quickly.

### 西南区合作社检查春耕生产资料的供应工作

　　西南区合作社检查春耕生产资料的供应工作
    西南区各地供销合作社积极进行供应春耕生产资料的准备工作。全区今年第一季度计划供应的生产资料，为去年第四季度的百分之一百二十八点九九，其中仅农具一项，就约值一千三百多亿元。
    中华全国合作社联合总社西南区办事处，于去年十二月十六日曾发出关于检查春耕生产资料供应准备工作的指示。四川省合作社联合社等曾派出工作组到下级社进行检查。目前，西南区各地供销合作社一般都正在进行产销调查，积极组织货源，有的地区的合作社并扩大了春耕生产资料供应计划。四川省泸县合作社联合社今年供应生产资料的计划，原来仅占零售总计划的百分之十三，现已扩大为百分之二十。长寿县铁、竹、木器业较集中地区的合作社，经过调查产销情况，已开始和手工业者签订购销合同。该县第七区供销合作社已和手工业者签订了四份购销合同，订购的竹、木农具和用具，共二万八千多件。乐山县第八区供销合作社计划经营生产资料一百零七种，比去年约增加四十七种，供应额为去年的百分之二百二十三点三，平均供应每一农业人口的生产资料约值二万六千余元。西康省合作社联合社今年第一季度计划供应的旧式农具，有十二万五千件，已有了相当储备。目前，西南区有的供销合作社的供应生产资料计划偏小，有的合作社还没有积极准备春耕生产资料。这些缺点，应迅速纠正。
