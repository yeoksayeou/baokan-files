The correct direction of mass amateur activities in factories
By our reporter An Gang

Mass amateur activities in factories should attract mass participation based on the principle of voluntarism. The experience of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in organizing mass amateur activities fully proves that this is the only correct direction.

Outside the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory stands a striking yellow and white building. This is the factory's cultural center. The cultural center has facilities for movies, slide shows, sports, photo exhibitions, playing cards, table tennis, billiards, and various chess games. There are also rehearsal rooms for workers to learn music, dance, drama, fine arts, and traditional Chinese martial arts. There is a hall of fame for model workers introducing advanced deeds, a technical exhibition room displaying models of workers' inventions and innovations, and a library. Lectures, forums, and gatherings are also frequently held. The cultural center is managed by the cultural center management committee. In addition to a director and two instructors who are detached from production, the rest of the committee members are elected from the masses or are active elements hired from the masses. The committee has nine groups, including cultural and recreational activities, library management, family work, and entertainment activities.

During the day, the instructors of the cultural center go deep into the workshops to understand various production situations and workers' ideological problems. Then, according to the propaganda work intentions of the Party committee, they find workshop propagandists (who are also the backbone of the cultural center's various groups) to jointly study propaganda methods, so that all propaganda activities of the cultural center can serve production. The instructors also need to understand the workers' preferences. For example, young people like to dance and sing, while older workers shake their heads when they see it. The cultural center understood their temperament and set up chess games specifically for older workers, which indeed attracted many people.

Organizing amateur cultural activities in the cultural center is not easy. Take acting, for example. There are few female workers in the factory, and no one wants to watch plays where men play female roles. So they thought about doing family work. When publicizing the Marriage Law, they staged two plays, "Little Son-in-Law" and "Liu Qiao'er." More than 20 family members automatically participated. In the past, none of the women knew how to sing Ping opera, but now they have rehearsed the plays in just fifteen days. When the plays first started, the workers waved their hands and said, "We won't watch it, it's not interesting" when they heard it was performed by their own people. What should they do? They mobilized the masses to engage in cultural activities together. Workshop activists organized art and literature groups, advocating self-creation and self-performance. Workers in the freight car workshop and the riveting workshop created their own scripts and performed in various workshops during lunch breaks. The cultural center, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League organized observation and competitions, and the good programs were taken to the stage of the cultural center for performance. For example, the workers, in connection with the production increase campaign, created the Ping opera "Everyone Advance" (the content is to strengthen the unity of young and old workers, overcome conservative ideas and empiricism, and jointly study tricks to solve key problems in production). This play has been performed more than ten times in the cultural center, with an audience of no less than 10,000 people. Many young workers reflected after watching it: "We must respect the master workers and learn from them." They constantly discovered some talented activists as the backbone of cultural activities. For example, Comrade Hu Zhong, a worker at the repair shop, is a recognized "all-rounder." He can write, speak, sing, and "speak eloquently," which is most likely to attract the masses. On the basis of popularizing mass cultural and recreational activities, the cultural center established a central art troupe. The central art troupe is the backbone of the factory's cultural activities. They have their own band, and they play music every day after dinner at 7 pm. The members opened special training classes to learn music theory. The theater troupe of the central art troupe has performed "Little Son-in-Law" more than a dozen times, and it is always packed. Old worker Liu Deming watched it seven times in a row. In his letter of thanks to the cultural center, he said that this play helped him solve the problem of disharmony between his father and daughter at home.

After the factory's cultural activities were launched, illiterate workers' family members automatically asked to learn to read; workers with low cultural levels asked to improve their culture. This not only changed the workers' family life but also cultivated the workers' civilized and scientific attitude towards technology and machines.

According to the current conditions in our country, it is not yet possible to concentrate all activities in the cultural center. Therefore, the cultural center must carry out its work externally. They carry out exhibitions in the factory compound. The library uses mobile book boxes to lend books to workshop workers, organizes workshop art groups, sets up technical rooms... All of this work revolves around the cultural center.

The largest outdoor amateur activity for workers at the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory is sports. In the factory compound, there is a central stadium, which was designed by a Soviet expert and built by workers through voluntary labor. It has basketball, football, and volleyball facilities. Workers in each workshop have basketball courts, and the central stadium regularly organizes competitions. The factory has mass sports activities throughout the year. In spring and autumn, there are track and field ball games competitions. In summer, there are boating and swimming competitions. In winter, there are skating competitions. After the sports were launched in the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, the workers became healthier. In 1952, the incidence rate of the entire factory decreased by 57% compared to 1951, and the number of patients decreased by 10%. Workers who were absent from work due to illness gradually decreased. Sports activities also cultivated the workers' collectivism, discipline, and tenacious spirit to overcome difficulties. In sports activities, they also paid attention to the interests of young workers and older workers and thought of some activity methods suitable for older workers, such as holding picnics, which were also participated in by older workers. In the first sports parade in 1952, the number of participants accounted for more than 80% of all employees, and the number of participants in the competition accounted for 30% of all employees.

Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the Party committee of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory made correct arrangements for the amateur activities of the employees. They combined inspiring workers' enthusiasm for participating in various activities with political and ideological leadership. The Party committee clearly recognized that: "Starting from the different requirements and hobbies of the masses, closely combining rest and entertainment with political and cultural activities can find a law of workers' life based on reality." In the past, when formulating the weekly schedule of amateur activities for all employees, they paid special attention to leaving time for employees to voluntarily choose to participate in amateur activities. The meetings they arranged for workers were generally few.

If we compare the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory with the way some factories we have visited handle workers' amateur activities, we can find the following differences: First, some factory trade unions or other mass organizations make rigid arrangements for employees' amateur activity time from top to bottom, such as stipulating that a certain time every day is trade union activity time, and a certain time is Communist Youth League activity time, etc. In fact, these activities are just meetings. Meetings are necessary. But many factories gather people to "speak" regardless of whether the masses need it or not. This kind of formalism meeting is of no benefit. Although the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Party committee also uniformly stipulates amateur activity time, it only holds necessary meetings and does not use all of the workers' time for meetings. Second, some factories decorate the workshops in a fancy way, like a club, while in the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, the workshops directly led by Soviet experts give people a clean and simple feeling. Experts believe that the environmental arrangement of the workshop must be able to concentrate the workers' minds on production and not distract the workers' energy. The main propaganda tools in the workshop are production progress reports, competition reports, safety education pictures, and attendance cards. All other social activities must be carried out in the spare time of the workers in combination with their own needs. Third, some factories have also emphasized organizing amateur activities according to the needs and voluntariness of the masses, but they cannot find a way and form a free flow. Later, they restored the old method of forcing the masses to participate in amateur activities. The reason is that they did not go to the masses to do in-depth work. In the past, a Soviet dance expert participated in the work of the cultural center. At first, the Chinese comrades were not used to dancing. The experts relied on the trade union and the Communist Youth League to discover and train activists and also worked in the families of the workers. As a result, more people started to dance. Comrade Yao Wanrong, the secretary of the Communist Youth League, said: "We have not forced anyone to participate in dancing. The experts have trained excellent dancing talents among the workers. They dance well, everyone likes to watch, and naturally they are willing to participate."

The method of arranging mass activities in the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory is a very good sprout. Comrade Shang Cheng, the secretary of the factory Party committee, said: "The cultural center we are running now can only be a prototype. The cultural center attracts too few people, and we need to further overcome formalism." This is very correct. At present, the mass work of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory still has many shortcomings. For example, the time for technical education is still too short, the preparation work for amateur training classes is not done well, and some practices are not substantive and there is a danger of becoming formal. These shortcomings need to be vigorously overcome. However, the undeniable fact proves that their direction of handling workers' amateur activities is correct. It raises a new question: that is, when the factory production turns to normal order, it is not appropriate to use administrative methods to mechanically arrange activity time. Factory employees' amateur activities must be organized under the principle of voluntariness. Voluntariness is not equal to free flow. And the only way to overcome free flow is for the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League to lead the employees' amateur activities with a positive attitude, create convenient conditions for employees' amateur activities, organize active elements among the employees to take the lead in carrying out activities, and promote the general with typical methods. The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory did this and achieved significant success. Mass amateur activities have become an important part of the political work of the Party and mass organizations, and the diverse cultural forms loved by the masses have become a powerful tool for the Party organization to carry out ideological education.

    工厂群众业余活动的正确方向
    本报记者　安　岗
    工厂的群众业余活动，应当按照自愿的原则，吸引群众参加。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂组织群众业余活动的经验完全证明：这是唯一正确的方向。
    在哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂门外，矗立着一幢粉刷成黄白颜色、令人注目的楼房。这就是该厂的文化馆。文化馆有电影、幻灯、体育场、图片展览、扑克、乒乓、台球和各种棋类等设备，也有为职工学习音乐、舞蹈、戏剧、美术、国术的排练室；有介绍先进事迹的劳动模范光荣榜；有陈列职工发明创造模型的技术展览室，有图书室；也经常举行讲演会、座谈会及联欢会等。文化馆由文化馆管理委员会管理，委员会除主任一名及指导员二名脱离生产外，其余都是从群众中选举出来的，或是聘来的活动分子。委员会下设文娱活动、图书管理、家属工作、游艺活动等九个组。
    文化馆的指导员白天深入车间了解各种生产情况和工人的思想问题，然后按照党委的宣传工作意图，找车间宣传员（也即是文化馆各组的活动骨干），共同研究宣传办法，使文化馆一切宣传活动都能为生产服务。指导员还要了解工人的喜好，譬如青年喜欢跳舞唱歌，老工人一看就摇头，文化馆摸了他们的脾气，专为老工人摆下了象棋，果然就吸引了不少的人。
    文化馆组织业余文化活动并不是容易的事，就拿演戏来说吧，工厂女工很少，男扮女装的戏没有人看。于是他们想到作家属工作。在宣传婚姻法的时候，他们排了“小女婿”和“刘巧儿”两个戏，家属有二十多人自动参加，妇女们过去谁也不会唱评戏，现在只用十五天就把戏排成了。开始演戏时，工人一听是自己人演的，就摆手说：“看不看不吃劲。”怎么办呢？他们发动群众一齐搞文艺活动，由车间活动分子搞文艺小组，提倡自编自演，货车车间，铆工车间工人都创作了自己的剧本，利用午间休息时间到各车间演出，文化馆、工会、青年团组织观摩比赛，把好的节目拿到文化馆舞台上去演出。例如工人们结合增产竞赛，编排了评剧“大家前进”（内容是加强青、老工人团结，克服保守思想和经验主义，共同研究窍门，解决生产中关键问题的一个戏）这个剧曾在文化馆演出十余次，观众不下万人，许多青年工人看后反映：“我们一定要尊敬老师傅并好好向他们学习。”他们随时发现一些天才的活动家作为文艺活动的骨干，像修机厂工人胡中同志，就是一个被公认的“全才”，他能编、能说、能唱，“出口成章”，最能吸引群众。文化馆在普及群众性文娱活动的基础上成立了中心文工团，中心文工团是工厂文艺活动的骨干，他们有自己的乐队，每天下午七点吃罢晚饭就吹、打起来，队员们开了专门训练班学习乐理。中心文工团的剧团上演小女婿已经十几次，每次总是人挤得满满地。老工人刘德明一连看了七遍，他在给文化馆的感谢信中说，这个戏帮助他解决了家庭父女不和的问题。
    工厂文化活动搞起来后：不识字的工人家属自动要求识字了；文化低的工人要求提高文化了，这不仅使工人的家庭生活起了变化，也培养着工人对待技术和机器的文明的科学的态度。
    按照我国目前的条件，还不可能把一切活动集中在文化馆内。因此，文化馆就要向外开展自己的工作，他们在工厂大院里开展览会，图书室用流动图书箱的办法把书借给车间工人，组织车间文艺小组，搞技术室……这一切工作都是围绕着文化馆来进行的。
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂工人最大的室外业余活动是体育运动。在工厂大院里，有一座中心体育场，这是苏联一位专家负责设计由工人用义务劳动修建起来的。里面有篮球、足球和排球。各车间工人都有篮球场，中心体育场经常组织比赛。工厂一年四季都有群众性的体育活动，春秋两季是田径球类比赛，夏季是水上划船游泳比赛，冬季有滑冰比赛。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂体育搞起来后，工人身体健壮了，一九五二年全厂职工发病率比一九五一年降低了百分之五十七，病人少了百分之十。因病欠勤的工人逐渐减少。体育活动还锻炼了工人的集体性、纪律性和战胜困难的顽强精神。在体育活动中他们还注意了青年工人和老年工人的兴趣，想了一些适合于老工人的活动方法，如举行野游等都吸收了老工人参加。一九五二年第一届体育检阅会，参加人数占全体员工的百分之八十以上，参加比赛的人数占全体员工的百分之三十。
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂党委在苏联专家帮助下，对职工的业余活动作了正确的安排，他们把启发工人参加各种活动的热情同政治的思想的领导结合起来。党委明确地认识到：“从群众不同的要求和爱好出发，把休息和娱乐同政治、文化活动紧密结合，就可以找到一个从实际出发的工人生活规律。”过去，他们在制订每周的全体员工业余活动时间表的时候，特别注意了给职工留出自愿选择参加业余活动的时间，他们为工人安排的会议一般是少的。
      如果把哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂同我们所访问过的某些工厂处理工人业余活动的情况来作一个比较，可以发现有如下的不同：第一、有些工厂工会或其他群众团体自上而下地把职工业余活动时间作了硬性的安排，如规定每天几点到几点是工会活动时间，几点到几点是青年团活动时间等。实际上这种活动都只是开会。开会是应该的。但不少工厂，不问群众是否需要就集拢人来“发言”。这种形式主义的会议是没有任何好处的。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂虽然党委也统一规定业余活动时间，但是，它只开必要的会议，而没有把工人全部时间都用来开会。第二、有些工厂把车间打扮得花花绿绿，像一个俱乐部，而在哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂，凡是苏联专家过去直接领导的车间，都给人以干净、朴素的感觉。专家认为车间的环境安排必须是能使工人思想都集中到生产中去而不要分散工人的精力。车间的宣传工具主要有生产进度报，竞赛捷报，安全教育的图画以及出勤牌等，其他一切社会活动都要结合工人自身需要在业余时间内进行。第三、有些工厂也曾强调过按群众的需要与自愿来组织业余活动，但摸不到办法，形成自流。后来还是恢复了强制群众参加业余活动的老办法。其原因就在于没有到群众中去作深入的工作，过去，苏联曾有一位舞蹈专家参加文化馆工作。起初，中国同志不习惯跳舞，专家依靠工会、青年团发现培养积极分子，又到家属中进行工作，结果跳舞的人就多起来了，青年团书记姚万荣同志说：“我们没有强制任何一个人参加跳舞，专家培养了工人中的优秀的跳舞人材，他们跳得好，大家都爱看，自然也就愿意参加。”
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂安排群众活动的方法是一个很好的萌芽。该厂党委书记商诚同志说：“我们现在办的文化馆只能是一个雏形。文化馆吸引人还少，需要进一步克服形式主义。”这是非常正确的。现在，哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂群众工作还有不少的缺点。如技术教育时间还嫌少，业余训练班备课工作做得不好，有些作法内容不充实，有流于形式的危险等。这些缺点需要大力克服。但，无可怀疑的事实证明，他们处理工人业余活动的方向是正确的。它提出了一个新问题；这就是当着工厂生产转入正常秩序后，那种用行政的方法，机械安排活动时间是不合适的，工厂职工业余活动必须是在自愿的原则下组织起来。自愿不等于自流。而克服自流的唯一方法在于党政工团要用积极的态度去领导职工的业余活动，为职工创造业余活动的便利条件，组织职工中的积极分子带头搞活动，用典型的方法推动一般。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂这样作了，便得到了显著的成功。群众性的业余活动成了党和群众团体进行政治工作的重要组成部分，群众所喜爱的多种多样的文化形式，成了党组织进行思想教育工作的有力工具。
