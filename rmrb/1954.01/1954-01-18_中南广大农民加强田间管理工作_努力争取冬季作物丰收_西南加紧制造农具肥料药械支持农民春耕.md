Xinhua News Agency: The broad masses of peasants in the Central South region are strengthening field management of winter crops to strive for a bumper harvest in the spring and summer seasons. According to preliminary statistics from the five provinces of Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, the total area sown with wheat, barley, oil crops, and green manure crops has reached more than 145.8 million mu. In the subtropical Pearl River basin and Hainan Island, various crops are growing luxuriantly, and inter-tilling, weeding, pest control, and topdressing are currently underway. In Xinxing County in central Guangdong Province, the wheat sown earlier has already grown to one chi tall; the wheat sown later is also four or five cun tall, and the fields are a sea of green. In order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest, the peasants first watered the wheat fields with manure, removed the weeds from the fields, and then used pond mud and crushed soil to mound the wheat roots, and cleared the drainage ditches in the fields. In the famous wheat-producing areas on both banks of the Yellow River, many peasants rushed to send accumulated snow to the wheat fields after the first snowfall to protect the wheat seedlings from winter. One village in Xiaotan Township, Yanjin County, Henan Province, has already rolled wheat on 320 mu, and piled snow on more than 300 mu of wheat fields. In areas of northern Henan Province where winter watering is customary, peasants are seizing the time to carry out winter watering of wheat fields. According to incomplete statistics from six counties including Bo'ai and Wuzhi at the end of last December, the area of wheat fields watered in winter has reached 160,000 mu. In the Shangqiu Special District south of the Yellow River, seven counties have begun applying topdressing fertilizer to wheat fields. In Zhecheng County, 210,000 mu of the 600,000 mu of wheat have been topdressed. In Hongan County, Hubei Province, barley, wheat, peas, and other crops have generally been weeded once, and most of the mutual aid groups have weeded twice and are applying topdressing.

Since studying the Party's general line for the transition period, the enthusiasm of peasants in various parts of the Central South region for developing production has become even higher. In the past, there was a common saying in Jiusi Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province: "Winter is a slack season, days are short, and the New Year (Spring Festival) is coming soon, so production will be discussed again in the spring of next year." However, after studying the general line, the local peasants have different opinions. Village cadres said: "If we relax our leadership in production, a bumper harvest will not be guaranteed. It will not only affect the lives of peasants, but also affect national construction." The slogan "It is glorious to sell grain to the state, and it is even more glorious to strive to increase grain production" is popular among peasants.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 17th: Many factories in the Southwest region that manufacture farm tools, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery, in order to meet the needs of peasants for spring plowing and to enable peasants to obtain inexpensive, high-quality, and suitable products, are working hard to increase production, reduce costs, and improve quality.

Chongqing Fertilizer Factory, Chengdu Fertilizer Company, and bone meal factories in Jiangjin, Nanchong, and other places in Sichuan Province are all manufacturing bone meal and granular fertilizers in large quantities. Local state-owned farm tool factories in Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces, as well as small farm tool and fertilizer processing plants operated by cooperatives in various provinces, are also actively rushing to produce various farm tools and fertilizers. The pesticide processing plant of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Southwest Administrative Committee will increase its production of insecticide powder by fifteen times this year, and most of it will be completed in the first quarter. Workers at the farm tool manufacturing plant of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau are constantly improving work efficiency, reducing costs, and improving quality. The factory will reduce the sales price of walking plows and corn threshers produced this year. The farm tool processing plant of the Fuling County Cooperative Federation in Sichuan Province plans to produce more than 22,000 pieces of high-quality farm tools this year. The factory workers are launching a labor competition. The Hanyuan County Cast Plow Factory in Xikang Province plans to send specialists to learn about iron smelting and water pumping methods, and plans to use water power instead of human power to pull bellows in order to improve the output and quality of plowshares.

    中南广大农民加强田间管理工作
    努力争取冬季作物丰收
    西南加紧制造农具肥料药械支持农民春耕
    据新华社讯：中南区广大农民正加强冬季作物的田间管理，争取春夏季丰收。据河南、湖南、江西、广东、广西五省的初步统计，现已播种的小麦、大麦、油料作物和绿肥作物等共达一亿四千五百八十多万亩。处在亚热带的珠江流域和海南岛，各种作物生长茂盛，现正在中耕除草、除虫和施追肥。广东省中部新兴县播种较早的小麦，麦苗已长一尺高；播种较晚的也有四、五寸高，田野里一片绿色。农民们为了争取麦子丰收，首先在麦田里淋了粪水，又把田里的杂草除净，然后再用塘泥、碎土把麦根培好，并沟通了田间的排水圳。在黄河两岸著名的产麦区，许多农民当第一次降雪后，都急忙把积雪送到麦田里，保护麦苗过冬。河南省延津县小潭乡一村已碾麦三百二十亩，并在三百多亩麦田里堆了雪。河南省北部有冬浇习惯的地区，农民们正抓紧麦田冬浇工作。据博爱、武陟等六个县去年十二月底的不完全统计，麦田冬浇面积已达十六万亩。黄河南岸商邱专区有七个县的麦田开始施追肥，柘城县六十万亩麦子，已有二十一万亩施了追肥。湖北省红安县的大麦、小麦和豌豆等作物已普遍锄草一次，互助组大部都锄过了二次，正在追肥。
    中南区各地农民自从学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线以后，发展生产的情绪更加高涨。湖南省湘潭县九思乡过去有句俗话说：“冬闲日短，快要过年（春节），生产到明年开春再谈。”但当地农民在学习了总路线以后，说法就不同了。乡村干部说：
  “我们若放松生产领导，丰收就没保障。不但会影响农民生活，也会影响国家建设。”农民中流行着“卖粮给国家光荣，努力增产粮食更光荣”的口号。
    【新华社重庆十七日电】西南区许多制造农具、肥料和农业药械的工厂，为了满足农民春耕的需要和使农民得到价廉、质高、适用的产品，都正在努力增加产量，降低成本和改进质量。
    重庆市肥料制造厂、成都市肥料公司和四川省江津、南充等地的骨粉厂，都在大量制造骨粉和颗粒肥料。云南、贵州等省地方国营的农具厂和各省合作社营的小型农具、肥料加工厂，也在积极赶制各种农具和肥料。西南行政委员会农林局农药加工厂今年生产的杀虫药粉将比去年增加十五倍，并且大部分要在第一季度内完成。农林局农具制造厂的工人不断提高工作效率，降低成本，改进质量，该厂今年生产的步犁和玉米脱粒机等将减低售价。四川省涪陵县合作社联合社的农具加工厂，今年计划生产两万二千多件优良农具。该厂职工正在展开劳动竞赛。西康省汉源县铸铧厂准备派专人学习化铁和抽水的方法，并准备利用水力代替人力来拉风箱，以提高铧口的产量和质量。
