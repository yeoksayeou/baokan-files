Guangdong's brown sugar and white sugar are steadily supplying the whole country. Since the beginning of January this year, thousands of tons of sugar have been shipped daily from Guangzhou, Shantou and other places to the central-south, east China, northeast and north China provinces, and some have been transported to the remote northwest. As of January 21, the Guangzhou Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Department Store had completed more than 80 percent of its monthly sugar supply plan. The brown sugar and white sugar needed by Beijing, Anshan, Fushun, Qinghai and other places in January have all been supplied according to the plan. A large amount of sugar needed for the Spring Festival in major cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin is also being supplied. (Xinhua News Agency)
