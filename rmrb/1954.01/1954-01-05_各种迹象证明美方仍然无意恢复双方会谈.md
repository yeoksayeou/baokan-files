Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 4th (Special correspondent Jiang Nan) reported: Twenty-three days have passed since the U.S. representative Dean rudely interrupted the bilateral talks on the political conference issue. The convening of the political conference is nowhere in sight, and the date of January 22nd, which the U.S. has scheduled for seizing South Korean and Chinese POWs, is only eighteen days away. The grave situation in Korea created by the U.S. is arousing strong concern among peace-loving people around the world, who are demanding that the U.S. government abandon its sabotage and immediately resume bilateral talks on the political conference issue, so as to convene the political conference concerning the future of peace in Korea as soon as possible.

However, from all indications at present, the U.S. government has not yet intended to change its old mind. According to news coming from the U.S. side, the interruption of the bilateral talks may continue until after the Four Foreign Ministers' Berlin Conference on January 25th. There are also reports that the U.S. simply does not want to resume the bilateral talks. The Associated Press, in a dispatch from Washington on December 31st of last year, which was obviously authorized, said: "It is said that the Communists recently expressed their willingness to withdraw their accusation that the U.S. had prior knowledge of South Korea's preparation to release 27,000 anti-communist POWs just before the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in June of this year."

The so-called "Communists recently expressed their willingness to withdraw their accusation," etc., is purely fabricated out of thin air and is not worth mentioning. But it is not difficult for people to see that the Associated Press's lie itself shows that the U.S. still has no intention of resuming the interrupted bilateral talks. Because Washington certainly knows that in the past, ever since the Syngman Rhee clique forcibly detained more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese POWs with the connivance of the U.S., the Korean and Chinese sides have repeatedly made this accusation. Now and in the future, the Korean and Chinese sides will never withdraw this accusation, and will raise this accusation again in the future if necessary. Because this is an irrefutable fact, and the U.S. bears inescapable responsibility. Former U.S. Far East Commander Clark personally admitted in a statement issued on June 21st of last year that he knew in advance that the Syngman Rhee clique "had privately and publicly advocated taking" the action of forcibly detaining POWs. The U.S. government is now stubbornly denying this undeniable fact, and stubbornly demanding that the Korean and Chinese sides withdraw their completely legitimate accusation before it is willing to resume bilateral talks, which shows that it still has not the slightest intention of repenting.

Now everyone believes that U.S. representative Dean's vile behavior in Panmunjom is unprecedented in the history of world diplomacy. The excuse he used to sabotage the bilateral talks was particularly clumsy, causing the U.S. government great embarrassment, so that Dean was criticized from all sides after returning to the U.S. Senior officials of the State Department blamed him for "choosing the wrong topic when interrupting the negotiations" because they "feared that the world would get the impression that the U.S. was interrupting the negotiations out of pique." The "New York Post" simply scolded Dean: "His technique is so bad that one cannot help but doubt his ability as a negotiator." It is said that even Dulles, that old partner in Dean's New York law firm, in order to shirk his own responsibility, also "flew into a rage" at him because he "gave the Communists an excuse to say that the United States is a warmonger and that the United States is unwilling to sit at the negotiating table for negotiations."

In order to extricate himself from his embarrassing situation, Dean is both instructing propaganda machines like the International News Service to whitewash him, saying that he has gained some "moral strength" because of sabotaging the bilateral talks, and directing another propaganda machine, the Associated Press, to spread the lie that the Korean and Chinese sides may withdraw their accusations, in an attempt to confuse the public. In fact, none of these can relieve the U.S. of its serious responsibility for sabotaging the bilateral talks in the slightest.

    各种迹象证明美方仍然无意恢复双方会谈
    【新华社开城四日电】本社特派记者江南报道：自从美国代表迪安横蛮无理地中断了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈以来，二十三天已经过去了。政治会议的召开遥遥无期，而距离美方预定劫夺南营朝中战俘的日期一月二十二日，却只有十八天了。由美国造成的朝鲜严重局势正引起全世界爱好和平的人民的强烈关心，要求美国政府放弃它的破坏活动，立即恢复关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，以早日召开关系朝鲜和平前途的政治会议。
    然而，从目前种种迹象看来，美国政府还没打算改变它的老主意。从美国方面传出来的消息说，双方会谈的中断，可能要继续到一月二十五日四国外交部长柏林会议召开以后。还有消息说，美国压根儿不想恢复双方会谈了。合众社在去年十二月三十一日从华盛顿发出了一条显然经过授意的消息说：“据说，共方最近曾经表示，他们愿意撤回他们的指责，即今年六月刚在朝鲜停战协定签订前不久，南朝鲜准备释放二万七千名反共战俘一事，美国是预先知道的。”
    所谓“共方最近曾经表示，他们愿意撤回他们的指责”云云，纯属无中生有，凭空捏造，是值不得一提的。但是人们不难看出，合众社这个谎言本身，倒说明了美方仍然无意恢复那中断了的双方会谈。因为华盛顿方面当然知道，在过去，远自李承晚集团在美方纵容下强迫扣留二万七千多名朝中战俘之日起，朝中方面就曾多次提出这个指责。在现在以至将来，朝中方面也绝不会撤回这个指责，而且今后在必要的情况下还会提出这个指责。因为这是一个颠扑不破的事实，而美方是负有无可规避的责任的。前远东美军总司令克拉克在去年六月二十一日发表的声明中曾经亲自承认：他事先知道李承晚集团“曾私下和公开地鼓吹采取”强迫扣留战俘的行动。美国政府现在硬要否认这个不容抵赖的事实，硬要朝中方面撤回完全正当的指责才肯恢复双方会谈，这说明它仍然没有半点儿悔祸之意。
    现在已经没有人不认为：美国代表迪安在板门店的恶劣行为，在世界外交史上是空前的。他所用来破坏双方会谈的借口制造得尤其拙劣，使美国政府大为丢脸，以致迪安在回到美国以后受到了各方面的斥责。国务院的高级官员们怪他“在中断谈判时选择了一个错误的题目”，因为他们“怕全世界将得到这样一种印象：美国意气用事地中断了谈判”。“纽约邮报”干脆骂迪安：“他的技巧又是这样糟，以致不能不令人怀疑他作为一个谈判者的能力。”据说甚至迪安的那位纽约律师事务所里的老伙计杜勒斯，为了推脱自己的责任，也对他“大发雷霆”，因为他“给共产党一个借口去说美国是一个战争贩子，并说美国是不愿意坐在会议桌旁进行谈判的”。
    迪安为着解脱自己的狼狈境地，正在一面授意像国际新闻社这样的宣传机器替他粉饰，说他因为破坏双方会谈而有了什么“道义的力量”，一面指使另一部宣传机器合众社散布朝中方面可能撤回指责的谎言，企图混淆视听。其实这些都不能丝毫解脱美国破坏双方会谈的严重责任。
