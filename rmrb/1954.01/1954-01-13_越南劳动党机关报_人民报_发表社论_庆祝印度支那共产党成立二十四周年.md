Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: According to a dispatch from the Vietnam News Agency on the 9th, the "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, recently published an editorial celebrating the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party (i.e., the Oriental Communist Party) on January 6th.

The editorial said: January 6, 1930, is one of the most important days in the history of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, because from that day on, the working class and people of these countries had their own political party; this party led them in the struggle for national liberation, democratic freedom, and a happy life. The Indochinese Communist Party is the vanguard and general staff of the working class and working people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

The editorial said: President Ho Chi Minh is the founder, builder, mentor, and leader of the Indochinese Communist Party, a loyal and most outstanding student of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in Vietnam, and the beloved leader of our working class and people.

The editorial pointed out: From the day the Indochinese Communist Party was founded, President Ho Chi Minh and the Party stipulated that the task of the Vietnamese revolution was to oppose imperialism and feudalism, and its nature was a national, democratic revolution. The Party's first program clearly put forward the slogans of national liberation and land reform. Because of its correct policies, the Indochinese Communist Party victoriously led the broad masses of the people in the revolution against imperialism and feudalism, and achieved brilliant achievements.

The editorial, in reviewing the various stages of the revolution, said: From the day of its birth, the Party was subjected to cruel oppression by imperialists and feudalists. It has experienced the most dangerous and glorious stages of the revolution. For example: the high tide of the workers' and peasants' struggle and the Nghe-An Soviet uprising in 1930, the democratic movement from 1936 to 1939, the struggle against Japanese and French imperialism from 1940 to 1944, the movement against Japan and for national liberation in 1945 and the "August Revolution," and the period of resistance and national construction since 1945.

In all the revolutionary stages, the Indochinese Communist Party has always stood with the masses of the people, organizing, educating, and leading the people to struggle; in the most difficult tests, the Party still held high the banner of national independence, and the Party used the slogans of national liberation and "land to the tillers" to mobilize millions of workers, peasants, and other patriotic people, and united them around itself.

The editorial, in tracing the birth of the Vietnam Workers' Party, wrote that with the development of the revolutionary situation, the Second National Congress of the Indochinese Communist Party held in February 1951 decided to change the Party's organization in Vietnam to the Vietnam Workers' Party, and formulated a new Party Program and Party Constitution.

Since then, the Vietnam Workers' Party has continued to lead the entire Vietnamese people in resistance and national construction, and has achieved many new victories. After the ideological consolidation movement within the Party, the political and military training movement in the army, and the consolidation of mass work, the Party's ranks have gradually been purified and become stronger day by day; the political quality, class consciousness, and technical level of the army have been improved, and the work of mobilizing the masses, especially mobilizing the peasants, has entered a new stage, that is, the stage of comprehensively mobilizing the peasant masses to implement the Party's land policy.

The editorial continued: President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party have stipulated two central tasks for the entire Party and the entire people in the future, namely, to promote the war of resistance and implement land reform. Completing these two tasks means steadily following the path previously taken by the Indochinese Communist Party, maintaining and developing the glorious tradition, and leading the war of resistance and national construction to complete victory.

The editorial pointed out: In order to complete these tasks, we must continue to study Marxism-Leninism, learn from the valuable revolutionary experience of other countries, especially the revolutionary experience of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, and also study the important policies of the Party and the government.

The editorial concluded: With the strong unity of our people, the heroic combat of our army, our strong Marxist-Leninist party, under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and with the active support of peace-loving people all over the world, we will surely achieve final victory.

    越南劳动党机关报“人民报”发表社论
    庆祝印度支那共产党成立二十四周年
   【新华社十二日讯】据越南通讯社九日讯：一月六日是印度支那共产党（即东洋共产党）成立二十四周年纪念日，越南劳动党机关报“人民报”最近一期发表社论庆祝这个日子。
    社论说：一九三零年一月六日，是越南、高棉和寮国历史上最伟大的日子之一，因为从这一天起，这几个国家的工人阶级和人民有了自己的政党；这个政党领导他们为争取民族解放、民主自由和幸福的生活而斗争。印度支那共产党是越南、高棉和寮国工人阶级和劳动人民的先锋队和参谋总部。
    社论说：胡志明主席是印度支那共产党的缔造者、建设者、导师和领袖，马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林在越南的忠实的、最杰出的学生，我国工人阶级和人民的敬爱的领袖。
    社论指出：从印度支那共产党成立之日起，胡志明主席和党就规定了越南革命的任务是反帝国主义、反封建主义，它的性质是民族的、民主的革命。党的第一个纲领就已明确地提出民族解放和土地改革的口号。由于它的正确的政策，印度支那共产党胜利地领导广大的人民群众进行了反帝国主义、反封建主义的革命，并获得了辉煌的成就。
    社论在回顾各个革命阶段时说：党从诞生之日起，就受到帝国主义者和封建主义者的残酷的压迫。它曾经历过最危险、也是最光荣的几个革命阶段。例如：工农斗争高潮和一九三零年的宜安起义，一九三六年至一九三九年的民主运动，一九四零年至一九四四年的抵抗日、法帝国主义的斗争，一九四五年的反抗日本、争取民族解放的运动和“八月革命”，以及一九四五年以来的抗战和国家建设时期。
    在所有的各个革命阶段中，印度支那共产党始终不渝地和人民群众站在一起，组织、教育并领导人民进行斗争；在最艰苦的考验中，党仍然高举着民族独立的旗帜，党用民族解放和“耕者有其田”的口号，动员了千百万工人、农民和其他爱国人民，并把他们团结在自己的周围。
    社论在追述越南劳动党的诞生时写道，随着革命形势的发展，一九五一年二月召开的印度支那共产党第二次全国代表大会决定把党在越南的组织改为越南劳动党，并拟订了新的党纲和党章。
    从那时起，越南劳动党就继续领导越南全体人民进行抗战和国家建设，并获得了许多新的胜利。经过党内的思想整顿运动、军队中的政治和军事训练运动和整顿了群众工作以后，党的队伍逐渐纯洁了，而且一天比一天强大起来；军队的政治素质、阶级觉悟以及技术水平都提高了，发动群众的工作，特别是发动农民的工作进入了一个新的阶段，就是全面发动农民群众实行党的土地政策的阶段。
    社论继续写道：胡志明主席和越南劳动党为全党和全体人民规定了今后的两个中心任务，就是推进抗战和实行土地改革。完成这两个任务就意味着稳步地遵循印度支那共产党以前所走的道路前进，保持并发扬光荣的传统，使抗战和国家建设走向完全的胜利。
    社论指出：为了完成这些任务，我们必须继续学习马克思列宁主义，学习其他国家的宝贵的革命经验，首先是苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的革命经验，也要学习党和政府的重要政策。
    社论最后说：有了我们人民的坚强团结，有了我们军队的英勇的战斗，有了我们这样强有力的马克思列宁主义的党，在胡志明主席的英明领导和全世界爱好和平人民的积极支援下，我们必然会获得最后的胜利。
