Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 11th: Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on January 10th regarding the resumption of bilateral talks on the political conference issue. The full text is as follows:

    Today, fair-minded public opinion around the world is looking forward to easing the existing international tensions through consultation. However, due to the unreasonable measures taken by the U.S. side, the current situation in Korea is far from meeting these legitimate expectations.

    The unilateral actions taken by the U.S. representative, Arthur Dean, on December 12, 1953, during the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, led to a prolonged interruption of the talks. Furthermore, on December 23, 1953, the U.S. side unilaterally announced the termination of the prisoner-of-war explanation work, placing the prisoner-of-war issue, which should have been justly resolved in accordance with the armistice agreement and the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," in a more difficult situation.

    In order to promote the convening of a higher-level political conference stipulated in the armistice agreement, to justly resolve the prisoner-of-war issue, to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and thus further ease international tensions and ensure lasting peace in the Far East and the world, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made consistent efforts. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expresses deep concern and attention to the aforementioned situation caused by the unreasonable actions of the U.S. side. Now, with the aim of promoting the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, which is universally desired by the people of the world, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea authorizes me to make the following statement:

    As is well known, all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war should have those requesting repatriation repatriated during the ninety-day explanation work conducted in accordance with the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work"; the remaining prisoners of war should then be handled through a political conference convened thereafter.

    However, the United Nations Command side, disregarding these provisions, mobilized special agents of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs planted in the prisoner-of-war camps under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to carry out suppression and violence against the prisoners of war, and failed to organize the isolation of prisoners of war, obstructing the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work to the prisoners of war in many ways, making it impossible for the prisoners of war to exercise their right to be repatriated under the armistice agreement.

    The aforementioned illegal measures taken by the U.S. side have created a serious situation, with the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work to the prisoners of war only lasting ten days out of the ninety-day explanation period, and more than 85% of the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war failing to receive explanations. Particularly serious is the fact that the U.S. side is attempting to blatantly violate the armistice agreement by forcibly releasing prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission without going through a political conference, directly handing them over to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs, creating new provocative actions and military adventures. The U.S. side not only announced the termination of the prisoner-of-war explanation work on December 23, 1953, but also, the U.S. representative to the bilateral talks, Arthur Dean, openly declared that Korean-Chinese prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission would be forcibly released after January 22, 1954. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also issued similar statements. At the same time, UN Commander-in-Chief Hull recently held talks with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek gang regarding the forced release of our prisoners of war.

    These various U.S. schemes regarding the prisoner-of-war issue have not only created a serious situation in the resolution of the prisoner-of-war issue, but will also bring about tremendous obstacles to the just resolution of the Korean issue. This is obvious.

    Therefore, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea specifically emphasizes that the U.S. government will not be able to escape full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this illegal scheme by the U.S. side on the prisoner-of-war issue. In order for the prisoner-of-war issue to be justly resolved, the U.S. side must guarantee the continuation of the explanation work to the prisoners of war in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," eliminate the special agents and thugs of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs planted among the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, eliminate violence against the prisoners of war, and organize the isolation of prisoners of war.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the termination of the prisoner-of-war explanation work and the forced release of prisoners of war are a serious violation of the armistice agreement; and believes that regardless of when the political conference is convened, it is necessary to immediately resume the prisoner-of-war explanation work that was unilaterally interrupted by the U.S. side, the ninety-day explanation period must be made up, and the political conference must be convened quickly to justly resolve the prisoner-of-war issue.

    The progress of the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, which began in Panmunjom on October 26, 1953, shows that the governments of Korea and China have consistently hoped for a swift convening of the political conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and have made sincere efforts to this end. In contrast, the U.S. government has obstructed the swift convening of the political conference, attempting to achieve its despicable aim of hindering the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and continuing to maintain international tensions. Since the start of the bilateral talks on October 26, the U.S. representative has not only wasted eighteen days of the bilateral talks on the agenda issue, but has also consistently adopted a delaying policy on the issues of the members, location, and time of the political conference. Disregarding this unreasonable attitude of the U.S. side, the Korean-Chinese representatives, in order to break the deadlock in the bilateral talks and strive for the swift convening of the political conference, put forward our comprehensive fifteen-point proposal on November 30, 1953.

    The people of the world warmly support and welcome this comprehensive proposal from the Korean-Chinese side. The U.S. representative participating in the bilateral talks has also failed to find any well-founded reason to reject this proposal. However, the U.S. side fabricated various excuses to oppose our proposal, even unilaterally withdrawing from the meeting and taking measures to indefinitely interrupt the bilateral talks.

    As mentioned above, the course of the bilateral talks on the political conference issue clearly shows that the governments of Korea and China have consistently hoped for the swift convening of the political conference and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and have made every effort and all preparations to ease international tensions and maintain lasting peace in the Far East and the world. In contrast, the U.S. government is not faithful to the peaceful resolution of all issues based on consultation, but has done everything possible to obstruct the swift convening of the political conference and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, deprive Korean-Chinese prisoners of war of their right to be repatriated, and continue to maintain international tensions, stubbornly pursuing new military adventures in the Far East.

    Fair-minded public opinion around the world has unanimously expressed great indignation and unease at the U.S. government's attempts to obstruct the just resolution of the Korean issue in every possible way.

    In order for the Korean issue, which is desired by the people of the world, to be peacefully resolved on the basis of consultation, and to ease international tensions, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that it is necessary to emphasize the swift resumption of the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, which were interrupted by the U.S. side's unilateral withdrawal from the meeting, the swift convening of the higher-level political conference stipulated in the armistice agreement, and the adoption of consultative measures to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, in order to ease tensions in the Far East and the world. It also believes that the comprehensive proposal put forward by the Korean-Chinese side on November 30, 1953, can serve as the basis for such consultation.

    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China pointed out in a statement on January 9, 1954, that "If the United Nations is still willing to fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter, then it cannot turn a blind eye to the current serious situation in Korea, but should assume responsibility for seeking a solution. If the United Nations General Assembly decides to discuss the Korean issue, then the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have the right to send their representatives to participate in this discussion." The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea considers this legitimate and expresses full support and endorsement; at the same time, in order to ease the continuing tensions in the current international situation, we call on the governments of all member states of the United Nations and the good people of the world to demand that the United Nations General Assembly seek effective measures to justly resolve the Korean issue.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expresses full support for the Soviet government's proposal to convene a conference of the five major powers of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China to review measures to ease international tensions, and actively supports the position stated by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in a statement issued on January 9, 1954, that "leading from the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Berlin to a Five-Power Conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China, to promote the resolution of urgent international problems, will be conducive to easing international tensions and ensuring international peace and security."

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on January 9, 1954, on resuming bilateral talks on the Korean political conference issue, is the most appropriate measure for rationally resolving the current Korean issue and easing tensions in the Far East and the world, and expresses full support and endorsement for this.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea hereby declares that we have full sincerity in swiftly convening the higher-level political conference stipulated in the Korean armistice agreement to rationally resolve the Korean issue through consultation, thereby easing the current continuing international tensions and ensuring lasting peace in the Far East and the world; and is confident that the progressive humanity and fair-minded public opinion of the world will consistently and without reservation support and endorse this legitimate desire of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

        Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

    就恢复关于政治会议问题的双方会谈
    朝鲜外务相南日发表声明
   【新华社平壤十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日一月十日就恢复关于政治会议问题的双方会谈发表声明。全文如下：
    今天全世界的公正舆论都在期待以协商方法缓和现存的国际紧张局势。但是，由于美方的无理措施，目前在朝鲜所发生的一切情况都远远地离开了人们这种正当的期待。
    一九五三年十二月十二日，在关于政治会议问题的双方会谈中，美方代表阿瑟·迪安所采取的片面行动，使双方会谈陷于长期中断的状态。美方并在一九五三年十二月二十三日片面地宣布终止对战俘的解释工作，使按照停战协定和“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定必须正当地加以解决的战俘问题，陷于更加困难的境地。
    为了促进停战协定所规定的高一级政治会议的召开，以便正当地解决战俘问题，和平地解决朝鲜问题，从而进一步缓和国际紧张局势，保障远东和世界的持久和平，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府作了始终一贯的努力。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对于因美方的无理行动而造成的如上所述的局势，表示深切的关心和注意。现在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府以促进全世界人民所一致渴望的朝鲜问题的和平解决为目的，授权本人作如下声明：
    如所周知，未直接遣返的全部战俘，在按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的规定而实施的九十天的解释工作过程中，要求遣返的战俘应予遣返；其余的战俘，则通过其后召开的政治会议加以处理。
    但是，联合国军方面竟不顾这些规定，发动布置在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘营中的李承晚和蒋介石匪帮的特务分子，对战俘施行压制和暴力行为，并且不组织隔离战俘，多方地阻挠朝中方面对战俘的解释工作，使战俘无法行使其按照停战协定所具有的被遣返的权利。
    美方采取的上述非法措施造成了严重的局势，使朝中方面对战俘的解释工作在九十天的解释期限中只进行了十天，还有百分之八十五以上的朝中战俘未能听取解释。特别严重的是，美方企图横暴地违反停战协定，不通过政治会议而把在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘强迫释放，迳自移交给李承晚、蒋介石匪帮，制造新的挑衅行动和军事冒险。美方不仅在一九五三年十二月二十三日宣布了终止对战俘的解释工作，而且，参加双方会谈的美方代表阿瑟·迪安居然公开声明，在一九五四年一月二十二日以后将强迫释放在中立国遣返委员会看管下的朝中战俘。对此，美国国务卿杜勒斯也发表了类似的声明。同时，联合国军总司令赫尔最近已就强迫释放我方战俘事和蒋介石残余匪帮进行了会谈。
    美方这种种对战俘问题的策划，不但在战俘问题的解决上造成了严重的局势，而且在朝鲜问题的正当解决上也会招来莫大的障碍。这是很明显的事情。
    因此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府特强调指出：由于美方对战俘问题的这种非法策划而引起的一切后果，美国政府将无法逃避其全部责任。为使战俘问题得到正当的解决，美方必须根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”与“解释和访问工作细则”的规定，保证对战俘的解释工作得以继续进行，肃清布置在朝中战俘中的李承晚、蒋介石匪帮的特务、暴徒，消除对战俘的暴行，组织对战俘的隔离。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为：终止对战俘的解释工作和强迫释放战俘是对停战协定的严重违反；并认为：不论政治会议在何时召开，都有必要立刻恢复被美方所片面中断了的对战俘的解释工作，必须补足九十天的解释期限，进而迅速地召开政治会议，正当地解决战俘问题。
    一九五三年十月二十六日在板门店开始的关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的进行情形表明，朝中两国政府始终如一地希望迅速召开政治会议以和平解决朝鲜问题，并为此而作着诚挚的努力。与此相反，美国政府却阻挠政治会议的迅速召开，企图达到其阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题，继续保持国际紧张局势的卑鄙目的。自从十月二十六日双方会谈开始以来，美方代表不仅在议程问题上使双方会谈浪费了十八天的时间，而且在政治会议的成员、地点、时间问题上，也一贯地采取了拖延政策。不顾美方这种无理态度，朝中代表为了打开双方会谈的僵局，争取政治会议的迅速召开，在一九五三年十一月三十日，提出了我方包含十五项的全面提案。
    全世界人民热烈支持和欢迎朝中方面的这一全面提案。参加双方会谈的美方代表也未能找到拒绝这个提案的任何有根据的理由。但是，美方却制造各种借口来反对我方提案，甚至片面退出会场，采取了无限期中断双方会谈的措施。
    如上所述，在关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的进行过程中，清楚地显示出：朝中两国政府始终如一地希望政治会议的迅速召开和朝鲜问题的和平解决，并为了缓和国际紧张局势和维护远东及世界的持久和平而尽了一切努力，并做了一切准备。与此相反，美国政府不忠实于建立在协商基础上的所有问题的和平解决，而百般阻挠政治会议的迅速召开及朝鲜问题的和平解决，剥夺朝中战俘被遣返的权利，并继续保持国际紧张局势，执拗地追求着在远东的新的军事冒险。
    全世界的公正舆论对于美国政府这样千方百计地阻挠朝鲜问题的正当解决，一致表示巨大的激愤和不安。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为使全世界人民所渴望的朝鲜问题在协商基础上获得和平解决，缓和国际紧张局势，认为有必要强调迅速恢复由于美方的片面退出会场而中断了的关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，迅速召开停战协定所规定的高一级政治会议，采取协商措施和平解决朝鲜问题，以缓和远东和世界的紧张局势，并认为：朝中方面在一九五三年十一月三十日提出的全面提案，可以作为这种协商的基础。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府周恩来外交部长在一九五四年一月九日的声明中指出，“如果联合国还愿意履行宪章所赋予它的责任，那么，它对于朝鲜的当前严重局势，就不能熟视无睹，而应负起责任来寻求解决的办法。如果联合国大会决定讨论朝鲜问题的话，则中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府有权利派遣自己的代表参加这一讨论。”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为这是正当的，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府表示完全支持和赞同；同时，为了缓和当前国际局势中继续存在的紧张状态，我们号召联合国所有会员国的政府和全世界善良的人民要求联合国大会谋求有效措施，正当地解决朝鲜问题。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对于苏联政府主张召开法国、英国、美国、苏联、中华人民共和国五大国会议以审查缓和国际紧张局势的措施的建议表示完全支持，同时积极支持中华人民共和国中央人民政府周恩来外交部长在一九五四年一月九日发表的声明中所表明的立场，即“由即将在柏林召开的四国外长会议，导向有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议，来促进迫切的国际问题的解决，将会有利于缓和国际紧张局势及保障国际的和平与安全”。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为：中华人民共和国中央人民政府周恩来外交部长一九五四年一月九日就恢复关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈的声明，是合理解决当前的朝鲜问题和缓和远东及全世界紧张局势的最适当的措施，并对此表示完全支持和赞同。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府兹特声明：我们对于迅速召开朝鲜停战协定中所规定的高一级政治会议，以协商的方法合理解决朝鲜问题，从而缓和目前持续着的国际紧张局势，保障远东及世界的持久和平，有着充分的诚意；并确信：全世界进步人类和公正舆论将始终如一地支持和赞同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府这种正当的意愿。
