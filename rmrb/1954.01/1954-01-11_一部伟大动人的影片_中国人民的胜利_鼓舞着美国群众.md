    A Great and Moving Film
    "The Victory of the Chinese People" Inspires the American Masses
    On October 31, 1953, a major event occurred in the political and cultural life of the American people: the color documentary film "The Victory of the Chinese People," depicting the great revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people, appeared on the screen of the Stanley Theater in New York.
    The film's release sparked a very strong reaction. After watching the film, William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, immediately wrote a letter to the New York "Daily Worker" to congratulate them. Foster said: This new film is "one of the best of all the greatest documentary films ever made," "The great revolutionary movement of the Chinese people to gain independence is movingly portrayed in this film. It foreshadows the same people's revolution for independence that will occur throughout Asia." He said: "This great film truly inspires every sensible worker, and can only deeply shock and depress all imperialists and their running dogs. The dream of Wall Street to rule China will never come true." The New York "Daily Worker" published an article by famous film critic David Platt on November 5, 1953, pointing out: "This first-rate documentary film is filled with the invincible spirit of the people in every scene. They recognize that justice is on their side and firmly believe that they will win."
    Not only the film's great political significance inspired American audiences, but also its beautiful artistic form was praised by American audiences. Foster said in his letter: "The battle to cross the broad Yangtze River is, I think, the most moving and beautiful scene ever seen on the screen." David Platt said in his film review: "The entire film is filled with a beautiful music that only an army participating in a just struggle can have."
    The success of the film's screening shocked even American bourgeois journalists. The New York "Saturday Evening Post" published an article by someone named Archil Weinstein, saying: "No one can deny that the characters and backgrounds portrayed in the film are very moving. Just as a spectacle, it shows the emergence of a new world power, which makes even the most unsympathetic observer stunned. ... Whether we like it or not, we had better pay a little more attention, at least to know those events."

    一部伟大动人的影片
    “中国人民的胜利”鼓舞着美国群众
    一九五三年十月三十一日，美国人民的政治和文化生活里发生了一件大事：描绘中国人民伟大革命斗争的彩色纪录影片“中国人民的胜利”，在纽约斯坦莱戏院的银幕上出现了。
    这部影片的上映，引起了极强烈的反映。美国共产党主席福斯特在看了这部影片后，马上写信给纽约“工人日报”表示祝贺。福斯特说：这部新影片是“历来所有最伟大的纪录影片中最好的片子之一”，“中国人民争取独立的伟大的革命运动在这部影片中令人感动地表现出来。它预示着全亚洲将要发生同样的争取独立的人民革命”。他说：“这部伟大影片，真正地鼓舞了每一个有头脑的工人，而使所有帝国主义分子和他们的走狗只能深感震惊和悲观。华尔街统治中国的迷梦永远不会实现了。”纽约“工人日报”在一九五三年十一月五日发表了著名影评家大卫·普拉德的文章，指出：“这部第一流的纪录影片，每一个画面都洋溢着人民的不可征服的气概，他们认识到正义是在他们一边，并深信他们一定会得到胜利。”
    不仅影片巨大的政治意义，鼓舞了美国观众，还有影片优美的艺术形式也使美国观众们赞口不绝。福斯特在他的信中说：“横渡广阔的长江战役，我认为是历来在银幕上所见到的最动人最优美的画面。”大卫·普拉德在影评中说：“整个影片充满着一种只有参加正义斗争的军队才有的优美的音乐。”
    这部影片放映的成功，就连美国资产阶级记者们也为之震惊。纽约“星期六晚邮报”刊载了一位名叫阿尔契尔·温斯汀的文章说：“谁都不能否认，影片所表现的人物和背景是非常动人的。就把它作为一种景象来说，它显示着一个新的世界强国的出现，它使一个最不同情他们的观察家也目瞪口呆。……不管我们欢喜不欢喜，我们最好还是稍多注意一些，至少也要知道那些事件。”
