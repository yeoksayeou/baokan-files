Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 13th. (By our special correspondent Wu Min) The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission yesterday rejected the Swedish committee's proposal to "release" non-directly repatriated prisoners of war as civilians on January 22nd. This indicates that the US attempt to legalize the forced detention of more than 22,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war has failed. The proposal was vetoed by a majority vote of the Indian, Polish, and Czechoslovakian members of the commission. The only member who voted in favor of the proposal was the Swiss member, who recently, along with the Swedish member, attempted to excuse the US from its responsibility for undermining the explanation work and the "Terms of Reference" in their "individual report."

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's rejection of the Swedish suggestion shows that the US demand to "automatically release" Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on January 22nd and hand them over to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek to be used as cannon fodder is illegal. The chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stated in a memorandum to both commands: "The explanations should continue," and "Submitting the future of the non-repatriated prisoners of war to a political conference is mandatory." In this light, the illegality of the US demand is especially obvious.

The Polish member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, when voting against the Swedish proposal, pointed out: "In the absence of completed explanation work and a convened political conference, no date can be stipulated to grant civilian status to prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation and whose future has not been decided by any political conference."

The Swedish member, for "political purposes known only to himself," attempted to distort Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference." This attempt "not only flagrantly violates the letter of an international document that forms the basis of our commission's work but also violates its spirit."

The Czechoslovakian member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also powerfully exposed the illegality of the Swedish proposal, which was formulated according to the US's "timetable" for the forced detention of prisoners of war. He pointed out that the provision that the issue of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation should be handled by a political conference is "mandatory, unconditional, and without any reservations." Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates that only those prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation and for whom no other disposition has been agreed upon by the political conference shall the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have the power to declare their release from prisoner-of-war status and make them civilians.

The Czechoslovakian member said: The Swedish representative said he wanted to guarantee the right of prisoners of war to be repatriated and protect their interests, but this statement "cannot be considered sincere." "If we remember that there were some delegations in the commission whose attitude made it impossible to take effective measures to truly guarantee the rights of prisoners of war and protect their interests, and the Swedish delegation was one of these delegations, then the insincerity of the Swedish representative's statement becomes even clearer." He said: Everyone knows, and it has been confirmed by the "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," that the prisoners of war in the South Compound "are not under the control of the commission but are under the rule of terrorist organizations directed by the detaining side. The commission itself has been threatened and intimidated by members of the original detaining party."

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's rejection of the Swedish proposal reveals to the world that it is illegal to unilaterally release prisoners of war on January 22nd as required by Washington. Washington's demand is to criminally and forcibly detain a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who wish to be repatriated. The only fair position that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force should take is to continue to hold the prisoners of war and replenish the ninety-day explanation period so that the prisoners of war can exercise their right to be repatriated.

### 瑞典委员非法提案被中立国遣返委员会多数票否决  美国想使劫夺战俘合法化的企图已告失败

    瑞典委员非法提案被中立国遣返委员会多数票否决
    美国想使劫夺战俘合法化的企图已告失败
    【新华社开城十三日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：中立国遣返委员会昨天否决了瑞典委员提出的在一月二十二日把不直接遣返的战俘“释放”成为平民的提案，这表明美国要想使强迫扣留二万二千多名朝中战俘合法化的企图是失败了。这一提案是经委员会印度、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员以多数票否决的。投票赞成这一提案的只有瑞士委员，他最近曾和瑞典委员一起在他们的“个别报告”中企图替美国推卸其破坏解释工作和“职权范围”的责任。
    中立国遣返委员会否决了瑞典建议，这说明美国关于在一月二十二日“自动释放”朝中战俘并把他们移交给李承晚和蒋介石充作炮灰的要求是不合法的。中立国遣返委员会主席曾在致双方司令部的备忘录中说：“解释应予继续”，又说：“将未遣返战俘的前途问题提交政治会议，这是有强制性的。”这样看来，美方要求的不合法就尤其明显了。
    中立国遣返委员会波兰委员在投票反对瑞典提案时指出：“在解释工作未完成和政治会议未召开的情况下，就不能规定任何日期，来使未行使被遣返权利的、其前途未由政治会议作出任何决定的战俘获得平民身份。”
    瑞典委员为了“只有他才知道的政治目的”，企图曲解“职权范围”第十一款，这种企图“不仅彰明昭著地违反了作为我们委员会工作基础的一个国际文件的文字，而且也违反了它的精神”。
    中立国遣返委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员也有力地揭露了按照美方强迫扣留战俘的“时间表”而制订的瑞典提案的非法性。他指出，未行使被遣返权利的战俘的问题应交由政治会议处理的规定是“强制性的，无条件的，没有任何保留的”。“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第十一款规定，只有那些未行使其被遣返权利又未经政治会议为他们协议出任何其他处理办法的战俘，中立国遣返委员会才有权宣布解除他们的战俘身份使之成为平民。
    捷克斯洛伐克委员说：瑞典代表说要保证战俘被遣返的权利和保障他们的利益，他这种说法“不能认为是诚恳的”，“我们如果还记得委员会中有一些代表团以它们的态度，使得采取有效措施确实保证战俘权利并保护战俘利益成为不可能，而瑞典代表团正是这些代表团中的一个，那么，瑞典代表的说法的不诚恳就更其明白了。”他说：大家都知道，而且已由“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”证实，南营“战俘并不是处在委员会控制之下，却是处在原拘留一方所指使的恐怖组织统治之下的。委员会本身遭到了原拘留一方成员的威胁和恫吓”。
    中立国遣返委员会否决瑞典提案，这向全世界揭露了：依照华盛顿的要求在一月二十二日片面释放战俘是不合法的。华盛顿的要求就是要罪恶地强迫扣留大批希望遣返的朝中战俘。中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队所应该采取的唯一公正立场，就是继续看管战俘，并补足九十天解释期限，使战俘能够行使他们的被遣返的权利。
