    The Northeast Forestry Industry Bureau has successfully conducted experiments with three-drum winch logging in the Second Logging Area of the Dailing Forestry Experimental School in order to solve the problem of timber collection and transportation in the summer. Three-drum winch logging is one of the main logging methods used in the Soviet Union, and its advantage is that it is not limited by seasonality and can be used for logging all year round. In this experiment, the entire logging process—from hooking the felled trees in the logging area to unloading the felled trees at the processing platform—required only four workers. The average time for logging at a distance of 250 meters was 21 minutes per cycle. Forty-two cubic meters of timber could be collected daily. During the experiment, the Haling No. 100 electric saw for processing and the Vakob electric saw for felling were also tested. According to the materials obtained from the experiment, the efficiency of electric saw processing was on average 9.5 times higher than that of curved-handled saws. The use of the Vakob electric saw for felling can increase efficiency fourfold compared to manual labor. This mechanized experiment pointed out a new direction for the development of the Northeast Forestry Industry and provided favorable conditions for year-round operations in the future.

    东北森林工业管理局试验机械化作业成功
    东北森林工业管理局为了解决夏季集、运材问题，在带岭森林实验学校第二伐木场进行三筒绞盘机的集材试验，已获得成功。三筒绞盘机集材是苏联目前主要集材方法之一，其优点是不受季节性的限制，一年四季都可用以集材。这次试验，整个集材过程——从伐区伐倒木的挂钩起直到造材台伐倒木卸钩止，总共只需四名工人。二百五十公尺距离的集材，平均每次为二十一分钟。每日能集材四十二立方公尺。在这次试验过程中，同时还试验了哈林一○○号电锯造材和瓦克勃电锯伐木。根据试验所得材料，平均电锯造材的效率比弯把锯要高九倍半。而使用瓦克勃电锯伐木可比人工提高效率四倍。这次机械化试验，给东北森林工业指出了新的发展方向，为今后的常年作业提供了有利的条件。
