The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's "Interim Report" pointed out that U.S. special agents in the East Camp 里 POW camp used violence to prevent our captured personnel from requesting repatriation, and wantonly sabotaged the explanation work in the East Camp 里 explanation site, so that our side only explained to a small number of POWs in ten days, and most of the captured personnel who heard the explanation did not dare to apply for repatriation.

East Camp 里 was originally a station on the railway line from Pyongyang via Kaesong to Seoul, twenty 里 southeast of Panmunjom. On both sides of the station was the East Camp 里 Indian troop-guarded camp. The explanation site was on a dirt slope southeast of the station and only separated from the POW camp by a small hill.

The explanation sites were divided into two groups, each with sixteen explanation tents. Each tent was spaced three meters apart and arranged side by side in a wire-fenced enclosure 150 meters long and 40 meters wide. The U.S. side squeezed the explanation tents together, the purpose of which was to make it easier for special agents to control the POWs and sabotage the explanation work. This way, as long as there were special agents making noise in one tent, it could affect the adjacent tents.

On the first day of the explanation work—October 15, 1953—we saw the activities of the U.S. side determined to sabotage the explanation work. U.S. special agents mixed among the POWs prevented the POWs from coming out to listen to the explanation. On this day, General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, held a conversation with thirty-one so-called "POW representatives," and reporters from both sides were invited to the scene. These so-called "POW representatives" were all Kuomintang special agents from Taiwan who had infiltrated the POW camp. They arrogantly made many unreasonable demands to Thimayya. Finally, these special agents inspected the explanation site and drew diagrams. After returning to the camp, they stepped up the arrangement to sabotage the explanation work. They took the map of the explanation site to intimidate the POWs, marking the "Road to Death" on the "Application for Repatriation" exits of each tent on the map, with the note: "A large number of Allied forces are monitoring and ambushing outside the door." The special agents threatened the POWs that they must go out from the designated door—the door of "Not Yet Applied for Repatriation," otherwise they would be caught back and stoned to death, beaten to death with乱棍! These U.S. special agents also pointed to the map to intimidate the POWs, saying: "Each tent is only a little more than one meter apart, and you can hear what you say. If anyone does not say what they were taught in advance, they will be killed when they come back!" They also said: "Those who request repatriation will have to be held in the barbed wire for four months," "Repatriation requires the unanimous approval of the five neutral nations committees. If the Americans put pressure, and one of the Swiss or Swedish committees disagrees, you will not be able to go back!" The special agents also forced the POWs to make "joint guarantees" and write blood letters. If one person requested repatriation, others should not think about living. In short, the special agents used countless chains of intimidation to tightly lock up the POWs.

In the ten days of explanation work that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has arranged intermittently in the past, each time it was carried out after obtaining the consent of the U.S. special agents, that is, the so-called "POW representatives," and agreeing to some of their conditions.

During these ten days of explanation work, our captured personnel were continuously strictly controlled and threatened by U.S. special agents from the time they were taken out of the POW camp until they entered the explanation tent. In the explanation site, a large number of U.S. officers, "psychological warfare experts," and executioners who had specialized in creating terrorist incidents in places such as Geoje Island gathered, including a large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents from Taiwan and South Korea. They all wore U.S. military uniforms and caps, spoke loudly, and whistled, going in and out of the barbed wire fence inside and outside the explanation site. Separated by a layer of barbed wire was the road that the POWs had to pass. The POWs were closely monitored by special agents at every level. After coming out of the POW camp, they first went to the waiting explanation tent, and then Indian soldiers led them into the explanation tent one by one. What they heard along the way was a burst of crazy shouts from the special agents and the POWs coerced by the special agents from inside and outside the tent; what they saw was the fierce eyes of U.S. soldiers and special agents, as well as the POWs who were forced by the special agents to shout and jump like crazy. They were forced to wear towels or white cloths with reactionary slogans written on their heads, and various reactionary slogans were forced to be wrapped around their arms and bodies; some people were even forced to carry dirty Kuomintang flags or Syngman Rhee's Taegeukgi on their backs; some POWs had their faces painted in various colors, or wore hideous masks. Under such a terrifying situation, how could a POW who had spent two or three years of terror in a POW camp not be frightened? Every captured person who was repatriated after explanation said that no one was dazed, their heads were swollen, and their bodies were twitching before entering the explanation tent; they all instinctively thought of the bloody "screening" scene of the U.S. side on Geoje Island in April 1952: heart-digging, flesh-cutting, beating... various tragic scenes.

Due to the deception and control of the special agents, our captured personnel did not know what was different between this explanation and the bloody "screening" of the U.S. side in the past. When they entered the explanation tent, they could only think about how to prevent themselves from being tortured and killed by the special agents after returning to the original camp. Many POWs had not heard what the representatives of the motherland were saying, and they had already drowsily started to make a lot of noise according to what the special agents had coerced them to do. They lost their self-control in extreme fear and shouted along with other shouts. They were extremely nervous, sweating on their foreheads, and their bodies spasming. Some trembled when they shouted, and their eyes were filled with tears. Many people shouted hoarsely in the tent, but as soon as they walked out of the door of "Not Yet Applied for Repatriation," they were listless and dejected. Some POWs turned their heads back to look at the explanation representatives in the explanation tent again and again, reluctant to leave. A captured soldier of the Korean People's Army shouted, "I want to go to the Republic of Korea!" but he kept staring at the door for applying for repatriation. He sat down and stood up for a while, and stood up and sat down for a while; sometimes he put his left leg on his right leg, and then his right leg on his left leg. Seeing his painful expression, people would also know how heinous the crime of the American aggressors in destroying human nature was.

U.S. special agents not only coerced POWs to make a lot of noise in the explanation tent, but also used knives, stones, and chili powder to commit violence, making it impossible for our explanation work to proceed.

Not only that. There was a U.S. "observation representative," a "detaining party representative," and a translator in each tent. Most of them were Chiang Kai-shek or Syngman Rhee special agents disguised as U.S. troops wearing U.S. military uniforms. According to our captured personnel who returned after explanation, among the U.S. "observation representatives" in the thirty-two explanation tents, twenty-eight were Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents sent from Taiwan that they knew. The "translators" were all Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents. Many Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents had long-term tortured POWs in the Jeju Island POW camp under the names of "instructors," etc.; later, they went to the explanation tents to sabotage the explanation work and threaten the POWs. These U.S. special agents often rudely interrupted and delayed the explanation work of our representatives, raised a lot of unreasonable "opinions" and "protests" to the explanation work, and obstructed the progress of the explanation work.

These evil special agents often revealed their special agent faces in the explanation site. On October 31 last year alone, reporters saw this kind of "observation representative" make a fool of himself on the spot twice in a row. On this day, in tent No. 6, when a "POW" was about to be taken out of the tent for separate detention for committing violence, he glanced at the U.S. Syngman Rhee "observation representative," and quickly raised his hand to salute and asked him: "Minister Xian! What should I do?" This special agent who exposed his face was embarrassed and panicked and said: "Wait a minute! Wait a minute!" According to the People's Army captured personnel who returned, when the U.S. side carried out the bloody "screening" in 1952, this "Minister Xian" was working in the special agent agency "C.I.E" of the Geoje Island POW camp and killed many POWs. People called him "Killing Major."

Because these special agents were scattered in various explanation tents, the POWs who came to listen to the explanation were under great mental pressure. For several years, the POWs had lived a life of terror under the clutches of these special agents. They are now using this fear that the POWs have of them to exert pressure to prevent the POWs from applying for repatriation. Every time a POW came in, they stared at the POW's face, using winks and gestures to warn the POW that he must go out from the door of "Not Yet Applied for Repatriation." They also often pointed to the "United Nations flag," the Kuomintang emblem, or Syngman Rhee's Taegeukgi on their arms to threaten the POWs, saying: "Listen to me!" They kept walking up to the POWs and shaking hands with them, saluting the POWs, and when the POWs mechanically said "No Repatriation," they clapped vigorously, and when the POWs did not make noise and looked at the door of "Application for Repatriation," they paced angrily in front of the door, talking loudly, or pointing their fingers at the door of "Not Yet Applied for Repatriation" and said: "You can go out in a while!" Even when the POWs pulled down their hat brims, covered their faces, and listened quietly to the explanation, they shamelessly bent down to look at the POW's face. The shameless actions of the U.S. "representatives" and "translators" were repeatedly reprimanded by the chairman of the subordinate body and even driven out of the tent, but these human scum who had lost all shame were transferred to other tents in a blink of an eye to do evil.

Our returnees all said that when they saw the U.S. "representatives" in the tent, heard these people's voices, and saw these people's angry faces or staring eyes, their hearts jumped and their teeth chattered. Lin Fengtang, a captured person on our side who applied for repatriation on October 17 last year, said:

"In the tent, I saw a 'instructor' with the surname Wang who had given us 'lessons' on Jeju Island. When I listened to the explanation, he kept staring at me with a fierce look, making my heart beat very fast. When I said I wanted to go home, he jumped up and shouted loudly at me: 'You must consider carefully!' I was so frightened that my whole body trembled, thinking that this time it would be like the '48 Review' last year. How scary was the '48 Review' massacre last year! Opening stomachs, digging out hearts, I was scared in my dreams! When I saw someone with the surname Wang shouting like this while listening to the explanation, how could I not panic? I even forgot that this was in the explanation tent. Fortunately, the explanation representative repeatedly reminded me and supported me, so I mustered up my courage and requested repatriation!"

The U.S. side's obstruction and sabotage of the explanation work was actually sheltered by the Swiss and Swedish representatives who were members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The Swiss and Swedish representatives interfered in every possible way with the patient explanation of the Korean and Chinese sides to the POWs. In the explanation tent, it could often be seen that the U.S. representative suddenly gave a wink to the Swiss and Swedish representatives, then looked at the watch; then the Swiss and Swedish representatives also looked at the watch, showing impatience, knocking on the table, and constantly urging the Indian chairman of the subordinate body to say: "The explanation time is too long," "This is a violation of the Geneva Convention and humanitarian principles," and sometimes simply said: "I don't think the explanation is interesting!" They never mentioned the Geneva Convention when U.S. special agents were dissecting POWs, and there was never a word of condemnation or criticism of the special agents, but they so deeply hated the patient explanation of the Korean and Chinese sides to the POWs. They also had a variety of means of interfering with the explanation work. For example, they described the POW's head-down thinking as the POW's "stomachache" and asked to suspend the explanation. When our explanation representative mentioned to the POW: "Your mother is waiting for you to go back at home," they actually said it was "a threat to the POW." They even proposed that they wanted to "go out of the tent to breathe fresh air" and asked to suspend the explanation. Once, in the two-hour explanation in tent No. 20, the Swiss and Swedish representatives interrupted the explanation seven times, one of which lasted as long as forty-four minutes, which was more than the total of forty minutes of the actual explanation time. Not only did they interfere with the explanation, but they also prevented the POWs from applying for repatriation. On November 4 last year, a POW also shouted in the same way when he first entered the tent. When the explanation representative asked him: "Do you want to return to your country now?" The POW said: "The squad leader told us that we should all return to Taiwan." The explanation representative repeatedly told him not to be afraid, and then he said that he wanted to return to his hometown. The explanation representative told him that if he wanted to return to his country, he should go to the door of "Application for Repatriation." At this moment, the Swiss and Swedish representatives suddenly stood up at the same time to stop the explanation representative from speaking and asked the Indian chairman to give the POW a routine closing remark. This sudden action by the Swiss and Swedish representatives made the POW hesitate again and panicked again and said, "Return to Taiwan." At this time, the explanation representative told him again that no one could harm him in the explanation tent, and that he could be repatriated on the same day. In this way, the POW mustered up his courage to break through the heavy obstacles and threats and came out from the door of applying for repatriation.

Because of the long-term terrifying influence of the U.S. POW camp on the POWs, as well as the various threats mentioned above, many POWs dared not express their desire to request repatriation. However, despite this, 137 Korean and Chinese captured personnel who listened to the explanation dispelled their doubts and applied for repatriation and returned. This gave the U.S. side's big lie of so-called "POWs unwilling to be repatriated" a thorough and devastating blow. Because of this, the U.S. side was very afraid that our explanation work could proceed smoothly, and wanted to brazenly deprive our captured personnel of the right to listen to the ninety-day explanation.

    美方是怎样在东场里解释场所进行破坏活动的
    李翼振　徐熊
    中立国遣返委员会的“临时报告”，指出了美方特务在东场里战俘营中以暴力阻止我方被俘人员要求遣返，并在东场里解释场所大肆破坏解释工作，使我方仅在十天中对少数战俘进行了解释，而且听到解释的我方被俘人员也绝大多数不敢申请遣返。
    东场里原是从平壤经开城到汉城去的铁路线上的一个车站，在板门店东南二十里。车站两旁就是东场里印度部队看管营地，解释场所在车站东南和战俘营场仅隔一小山岗的土坡上。
    解释场所分为两组，每组有十六个解释帐篷，每个帐篷间隔三公尺，紧挨着排列在一个长一百五十公尺、宽四十公尺的铁丝网围场里。美方把解释帐篷挤在一起，目的就是使特务分子便于控制战俘和破坏解释工作。因为这样只要一个帐篷中有特务分子吵闹，就能影响相邻的各个帐篷。
    在解释工作开始的第一天——一九五三年十月十五日，我们就看到了美方决心破坏解释工作的活动。混在战俘中的美方特务分子阻止战俘出来听取解释。这天，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军和三十一个所谓“战俘代表”举行了谈话，双方记者都被邀到场。这些所谓“战俘代表”都是混进战俘营中的台湾国民党特务，他们狂妄地向蒂迈雅提出许多无理要求，最后这些特务分子视察了解释场所，并画了图形。他们回到营场后就加紧进行破坏解释工作的布置。他们拿着解释场所的地图恐吓战俘，在图上各个帐篷的“申请遣返”的出口都标上“死亡之路”，下面注明：“门外有大批联军人员在那里监视和埋伏着”，特务分子威胁战俘必须从指定的门——“尚未申请遣返”的门出去，否则就要被抓回去用石头砸死，用乱棍打死，这些美方特务还指着地图恐吓战俘说：“每个帐篷相隔只有一公尺多，说话都能听见，如果有谁不按预先教的话说，回来一定把他杀死！”又说：“要求遣返的人还要在铁丝网里关四个月”，“遣返要五个中立国委员一致通过才行，美国人一加压力，瑞士或瑞典委员有一个不同意，你就回不去！”特务们又强迫战俘立下“连环保”，写下血书，一人要求遣返，别人就别想活命。总之，特务分子用无数条恐吓的铁链，把战俘们紧紧地锁住了。
    中立国遣返委员会在过去断断续续地安排进行的十天解释工作中，每次都是在取得美方特务即所谓“战俘代表”的同意，并答应了他们一些条件后才进行的。
    就在这十天的解释工作中，我方被俘人员从被带出战俘营直到进入解释帐篷，也都继续受到美方特务的严密控制和威胁。在解释场所里，麇集了大批美国的军官、“心理战专家”和过去在巨济岛等地专门制造恐怖事件的刽子手，其中有大批来自台湾、南朝鲜的蒋李特务。他们都穿戴着美国军衣、军帽，大声说着话，吹着口哨，在解释场所的铁丝网内外进进出出。隔着一层铁丝网，就是战俘们必须通过的道路。战俘们由特务分子层层监视着，从战俘营出来，先到等待解释帐篷，然后由印度士兵一个一个地带进解释帐篷。他们一路上听到的是一片从帐篷内外所发出的特务及在特务分子胁迫下的战俘的疯狂的喊叫声；看到的是美国军人和特务的凶恶的目光，以及在特务分子逼迫下像疯了一样喊着跳着的战俘。他们头上被强迫扎着写有反动标语的毛巾或白布，臂上和身上被强迫包着各种各样反动标语；有的人的身上还被迫背上肮脏的国民党旗或李匪帮的太极旗；有的战俘脸上涂得五颜六色，或者戴着面目狰狞的假面具。在这样的恐怖情况下，一个在战俘营过了两、三年恐怖生活的战俘，怎能不胆战心惊？每一个经解释遣返回来的被俘人员都说，没有一个人在进解释帐篷前不是神志昏迷，头脑发胀，混身肉跳；他们都本能地想起一九五二年四月美方在巨济岛血腥“甄别”的情景：挖心、剐肉、毒打……种种惨象。
    由于特务分子的欺骗和控制，我方被俘人员还不知道这次解释和过去美方的血腥“甄别”有什么不同。他们进了解释帐篷时，只能想到怎样使自己回到原营场后不被特务拷打和杀死。许多战俘还没有听到祖国代表讲些什么，他们已经昏昏沉沉地按照特务们胁迫他们必须做的大吵大闹起来了。他们在万分恐惧下失去了自制力，随着别的喊声喊起来了。他们精神紧张异常，额上冒汗，混身痉挛。有的在吵嚷时声音颤抖，眼里噙着泪水。很多人虽然在帐篷里声嘶力竭地大喊着，可是一走出“尚未申请遣返”的门，就颓然若失，垂头丧气。有的战俘还痛苦地一再回转头来看解释帐篷里的解释代表，留恋不忍离去。有一个朝鲜人民军被俘人员虽然嘴里喊：“我要到大韩民国！”但人却不住地盯着申请遣返的门。他一时坐下又站起，站起又坐下；一时左腿放在右腿上，右腿又放在左腿上。看到他的痛苦的表情，人们也就会知道，美国侵略者摧残人性的罪行是严重到了怎样万恶不赦的程度。
    美方特务不仅胁迫战俘到解释帐篷大吵大闹，而且用刀子、石头和辣椒粉等行凶，使我方解释工作无法进行。
    不仅这样。每一个帐篷中都有美方一名“观察代表”，一名“拘留方代表”和一名翻译人员。他们大多数是穿着美军制服冒充美军的蒋介石或李承晚特务分子。据经解释归来的我方被俘人员说，在三十二个解释帐篷里的美方“观察代表”中，就有二十八个是他们认识的蒋介石匪帮从台湾派来的特务分子。“翻译”则全部是李、蒋特务。许多李、蒋特务曾在济州岛战俘营以“教官”等名义长期残害战俘；后来又到解释帐篷中来破坏解释工作、威胁战俘了。这些美方特务时常横暴地打断和拖延我方代表的解释工作，对解释工作提出一大堆毫无理由的“意见”和“抗议”，阻挠解释工作的进行。
    这些万恶的特务分子，在解释场所时常露出了他们的特务面目。仅在去年十月三十一日这一天，记者就一连两次看到这种“观察代表”的当场出丑。这天，在六号帐篷，有一个“战俘”因行凶要被带出帐篷去单独拘留时，他一眼看到美方的李承晚
  “观察代表”，连忙举手敬礼，并向他请示：“咸部长！怎么办？”这个暴露了面目的特务被弄得面红耳赤，惊慌不知所措地说：“等一等！等一等！”据归来的人民军被俘人员说，一九五二年美方进行血腥“甄别”时，这个“咸部长”正在巨济岛战俘营的特务机关“C·I·E”任职，杀死了许多战俘，人们都称他叫“杀人少校”。
    由于这些特务散布在各个解释帐篷里，使前来听取解释的战俘在精神上受到很大的压力。几年来战俘们就是在这些特务的魔掌下过着恐怖的生活，他们现在正利用这种战俘对他们的恐惧心理，施展他们使战俘不敢申请遣返的压力。每次，一当战俘进来时，他们就死死盯住战俘的脸，用眼色和手势警告战俘必须从“尚未申请遣返”的门出去。他们还时常指着臂上的“联合国旗”、国民党徽或李匪帮的太极旗，对战俘威胁说：“听我的话！”他们不断走到战俘的面前和战俘握手，向战俘敬礼，当战俘机械地说“不遣返”时，他们就使劲地鼓掌，当战俘不吵不闹向“申请遣返”的门看时，他们就气虎虎地在门前走动，大声讲话，或者手指着“尚未申请遣返”的门说：“你过一会就可以出去了！”甚至当战俘拉下帽檐，遮住脸，静听解释时，他们竟无耻地弯下腰来看战俘的脸。美方“代表”和“翻译”这种无耻行动，屡次受到附属机构主席的叱责，甚至被赶出帐篷，但这些丧尽了廉耻的人类的渣滓，一转眼又调换到别的帐篷中去作恶了。
    我方归来人员都说，当他们在帐篷里看到美方“代表”，听到这些人的声音，看到这些人的怒容或者瞪眼时，就心惊肉跳，牙齿打颤。在去年十月十七日申请遣返回来的我方被俘人员林凤堂说：
    “在帐篷里我看见一个姓王的在济州岛给我们讲过‘课’的‘教官’，在我听解释时，他一直瞪着眼，恶狠狠地看着我，看得我心中卜通卜通地跳。当我说要回家时，他就暴跳起来，向我大声嚷道：‘你必须慎重考虑！’吓得我混身直发抖，以为这下又要和去年‘四八审查’一样了。去年‘四八审查’大屠杀时多吓唬啦！开膛、挖心，我夜里做梦都害怕！在听解释看到姓王的这么吆喝，心里还能不慌？我连这是在解释帐篷里也都忘了。幸亏解释代表一再提醒我，给我撑腰，我才壮了胆，要求遣返！”
    美方这样阻挠和破坏解释工作，居然得到作为中立国遣返委员会委员的瑞士和瑞典代表的庇护。瑞士和瑞典代表百般干涉朝中方面对战俘进行耐心的解释。在解释帐篷里常常可以看到：美方代表忽然向瑞士、瑞典代表丢过一个眼色，随后看看表；接着瑞士、瑞典代表也便看表，现出不耐烦的样子，敲着桌子，不断催促附属机构印度主席说：“解释时间太长”啦、“这是违反日内瓦公约和人道原则”啦，有时干脆说：“我看解释没有意思！”他们在美方特务将战俘剖腹挖心的时候，从来不提日内瓦公约，对特务从无一句谴责或批评，可是却这样深恨朝中方面对战俘的耐心解释。他们干涉解释工作的手段也是花样百出的，例如，他们把战俘低头思考说成是战俘“肚子疼”，而要求中止解释。我方解释代表向战俘提到：“你的母亲在家里盼望着你回去”，他们竟说是“对战俘的威胁”。他们甚至提出他们要“到帐篷外呼吸新鲜空气”，而要求中止解释。有一次，在二十号帐篷的两小时的解释中，瑞士和瑞典代表竟打断了解释七次，其中有一次长达四十四分钟，比实际进行解释的时间的总和四十分钟还要多。不只干涉解释，他们还阻止战俘申请遣返。去年十一月四日，有一个战俘刚进入帐篷时也照样嚷叫，当解释代表问他：“你现在要求回国吗？”这个战俘说：“班长对我们说，都要回台湾。”解释代表一再要他不用害怕，他才说他想回家乡。解释代表告诉他，要回国就走“申请遣返”的门。正在这时，瑞士和瑞典代表忽然同时站起来阻止解释代表讲话，而要印度主席对战俘来一番例行手续的结束语。瑞士和瑞典代表这一突如其来的行动，使这个战俘重新又犹豫了一下，又惊慌地说起“回台湾”来了。这时，解释代表再一次告诉他，在解释帐篷中谁都不能伤害他，并且可以在当天遣返回来。这样，这个战俘才壮着胆摆脱重重阻挠和威胁，从申请遣返的门出来了。
    因为美方战俘营给予战俘们的长期的恐怖影响，以及上述的种种威胁，所以很多战俘都不敢表示自己要求遣返的愿望。但是，尽管如此，仍然有一百三十七名朝中被俘人员听过解释后解除疑虑，申请遣返归来了。这给予美方所谓“战俘不愿遣返”的大骗局以彻底的粉碎性的打击。正因为这样，美方才非常害怕我方解释工作得以顺利进行，才要悍然剥夺我方被俘人员听取九十天解释的权利。
