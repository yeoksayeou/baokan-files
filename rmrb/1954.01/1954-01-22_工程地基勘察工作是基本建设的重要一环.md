Engineering geological survey is an important part of basic construction.
Geological Survey Office, Design Institute of the Central Ministry of Construction.
	Engineering geological survey is a very important part of basic construction, but this is still a new task in our country, with low technical level, lack of cadres and tools, and many existing problems, so it is also the weakest link in basic construction.
	Everyone knows that the foundation bears the weight of the entire building. The foundation is composed of soil, and in terms of its properties, it is also a kind of building material. Before we purchase building materials, we need to consider their quality, and the quality of the foundation needs to be carefully selected, because the foundation soil is more important and more complex than other general building materials. If the foundation strength is not enough, or uneven settlement is caused by different compressibility, the building will experience partial or complete cracks, tilting, and even destruction. In the past few years, there have been many painful lessons like this. For example, a three-story office building of a certain organization in North China did not conduct a geological survey before construction, and only determined the soil bearing capacity to be eight tons per square meter based on a few unreliable load tests. As a result, many cracks occurred after completion due to loose and uneven backfilling of different thicknesses. A four-story reinforced concrete factory building of a flour mill in Tianjin did not conduct a geological survey in advance, and subjectively determined the soil bearing capacity to be ten tons per square meter, placing the entire high-rise building on a sandy clay layer close to the river and often soaked in water. When construction reached the third floor, beam breaks and slab cracks occurred. Another example is a textile factory in Northwest China, where most of the columns settled unevenly immediately after completion, seriously affecting its use and causing great losses. Therefore, the importance of geological survey work cannot be ignored.
	Geological survey is also an extremely complex task. To select and design a foundation, we must first understand the weight transmitted from the building (external force), calculate the stress distribution inside the foundation, and then compare it with the strength of the foundation material, ensuring that the deformation of the foundation will not endanger the safe use of the building. Determining the foundation strength is far more complex than judging other building materials (such as steel, cement, brick, and wood). The properties of the same type of concrete or brick and wood are roughly similar, and the test of one sample can roughly represent the whole. However, although soil is naturally formed, its properties are complex, its types are diverse, and it varies from place to place. Therefore, some engineers say, "I am confident in all other issues, but I am not confident in soil." This is not without reason. We must fully recognize the complexity of geological survey work, and always maintain a humble learning attitude. We must treat any foundation as a new problem to be dealt with. Even if there is soil data nearby, it can only be used as a reference. Therefore, to economically and rationally select and use a foundation, it is necessary to conduct drilling and soil testing (sometimes on-site load tests are required) to fully understand the condition of the foundation soil.
	At present, geological survey work is far from meeting the needs of basic construction. In the past few years, many lessons from neglecting geological survey work have awakened many leading cadres in basic construction to start paying attention to geological survey work, but some leading cadres' attention to geological survey work has remained only verbal, and some basic construction departments still do not have survey organizations, and even more common is the lack of specific leadership for geological survey work.
	In order to change the backward state of geological survey work, survey units must first solve the contradiction between strength and tasks. At present, the technical strength of surveying is very weak, and most of the technical cadres have been transferred from other technical jobs, and the number is also very small. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological leadership, consolidate the professional thinking of existing personnel, make them fully aware of the importance of their work, settle down in their new positions, and organize them to study in depth and strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; on the other hand, it is necessary to set up short-term training courses to train junior and intermediate technicians to strengthen the force and meet the needs of the country.
	Secondly, engineering geological survey work should be carried out according to a certain procedure. Although the selection of foundations in urban construction is often restricted by land area and urban planning, it cannot abandon the certain procedure of geological survey. We must first do a preliminary survey. Architectural designers can use the data from the preliminary survey to select an appropriate foundation and carry out the layout. After the layout is designed and the location of the building has been determined, in order to further understand the nature of the foundation, a technical survey must be carried out, and the foundation should be designed according to the technical survey. If the preliminary survey is ignored, it is easy to cause waste, rework, delay of construction period and other adverse consequences. A dormitory project of a certain college in Beijing did not conduct a preliminary survey and arranged the building. After drilling, it was found that there was a one-meter thick layer of organic soft clay close to the ground, which required pile reinforcement or relocation. At the request of the owner, the drilling site was relocated six times, costing more than 100 million yuan in drilling and testing fees, and delaying the construction period.
	Third, engineering geological survey and design should be closely coordinated. Engineering geological survey work is to serve the design. The data of the foundation must fully meet the requirements of the design, and the designers must also rationally and fully use these data. Some designers ignore the suggestions of the preliminary survey and still arrange the buildings in areas with poor soil, which wastes survey data and loses the significance of the preliminary survey. Also, because the nature of the foundation has a very important relationship with the form of the structure and the use of the building, the person in charge of the geological survey must fully understand the detailed information of the superstructure. If the design of the foundation is separated from the superstructure, it will surely be counterproductive. Therefore, the geological survey department should require the design department to provide detailed information before accepting the task.
	After the design department obtains the technical survey data, it should start the design of the foundation. If the building is a multi-story building or a heavy factory building, the soil workers and the design workers must closely cooperate in considering the settlement, soil bearing capacity, and the reaction force of the soil to the foundation, so as to design an economical and reasonable foundation. Since the foundation and the foundation are mutually influential and have a close relationship, we believe that it is convenient and beneficial for one department to be responsible for the design of the foundation and the foundation. That is, the design department entrusts the survey department with the upper structure for survey and foundation design; or the design department directly formulates a geological survey plan according to the design needs, and entrusts the drilling team and the laboratory to implement it. After obtaining the data, the design department solves the foundation and foundation problems together.
	Fourth, improve the organization of engineering geological survey. To deal with a foundation, there are generally two steps: field drilling, indoor testing and foundation design. Field drilling and indoor testing are to provide detailed information on the foundation, and foundation design is to analyze the data to determine the compressive strength of the foundation, the form of the foundation, the reasonable depth of the foundation, and analyze and judge the possible settlement of the building.
	For the first purpose, a drilling team and a laboratory must be set up. For the second purpose, a technical group must be set up. The task of the drilling team is to carry out drilling in the designated area and take soil samples for testing. The soil is composed of mineral solids, air and water. During the drilling and sampling process, it is easy to compress the sample or lose part of the water, and lose its original natural properties. Therefore, an important task of the drilling team is to try to obtain undisturbed soil samples of the structure, which requires good drilling tools and skilled technicians. The main task of the soil laboratory is to analyze soil samples. Generally, buildings and ordinary foundations only need to do physical tests. For high-rise buildings, heavy factory buildings or special buildings, mechanical tests need to be added. The equipment and manpower of the laboratory should be coordinated with the daily soil output of the drilling team. The work of the technical group is to accept tasks, formulate survey plans, issue tasks to the drilling team and the soil laboratory, inspect the construction site and comprehensively analyze geological and test data, and submit survey reports (including foundation design and foundation recommendations), and inspect the bottom of the groove before foundation construction.
	At present, the organization of geological survey is scattered. Each basic construction unit is engaged in its own business. The already weak technical strength is weakened after being dispersed; and the existing manpower and equipment cannot be fully utilized, so that some are too busy and some are idle during the same period. In order to give full play to the existing strength, the transition from decentralization to centralization should be gradually carried out in a planned way.
	Finally, we must strengthen the study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Soviet foundation and foundation science has made outstanding achievements. The Soviet theory on foundations is completely combined with actual construction and verified by practice. The Soviet Union has published many specialized books in this field. The leading departments of basic construction and research and education departments should organize forces to engage in translation and publication, so as to improve the theoretical and technical level of survey workers.

    工程地基勘察工作是基本建设的重要一环
    中央建筑工程部设计院勘测室
    工程地基勘察工作是基本建设中很重要的一环，但这在我国还是一件新的工作，技术水平低，干部及工具缺乏，存在的问题很多，因此也是基本建设中最薄弱的一环。
    大家都知道：地基承托着整个建筑物的重量。地基是由土壤组成的，就其性质来讲，也是建筑材料的一种。我们在购买建筑材料之前，要考虑其质量优劣，而地基的优劣，就更需要严加选择，因为地基土壤较其他一般建筑材料更重要，也更复杂。如果地基强度不够，或压缩性不同而引起不均匀下沉，建筑物将部分的或整个的裂缝、倾斜，甚至破坏，几年来，这样的惨痛教训是很多的。如华北某机关的一座三层办公楼，修建以前没有勘察地基，只根据几个不可靠的荷载试验，就确定土壤的耐压力为每平方公尺八吨，结果因填土松软不匀、厚薄不同，竣工后发生许多裂缝。天津一个面粉厂的四层钢筋混凝土厂房，事先没有进行地基勘察，就主观决定土壤耐压力为每平方公尺十吨，将整个高层建筑放在距河很近，且经常泡在水中的砂质粘土层上，待施工到第三层时，就发生梁断板裂的现象。又如西北某纺织厂，刚修建完毕，大部分柱子就不均匀地下沉，严重影响到使用，损失很大。因此地基勘察工作的重要性是不容忽视的。
    地基勘察工作也是一个极其复杂的工作。我们选择和设计一个地基，先要了解建筑物传递下来的重量（外力），计算地基内部应力的分布，而后与地基材料的强度比较，务使地基的变形不致危及建筑物的安全使用。确定地基强度远比判断其他建筑材料（如钢筋水泥、砖、木）为复杂，同一品种的混凝土或砖木，性质大体相似，取一个试样的试验，可以大致代表全体。但土壤虽是天然构成，然而性质复杂，种类繁多，因地而异，所以有些工程师说：“别的问题都有把握，就是对土壤没有把握”，这不是没有原因的。我们要充分认识地基勘察工作的复杂性，要始终以虚心学习的态度，碰到任何一个地基，都要当作一个新问题来处理，即使近处已有土壤资料，也只能作为参考。因此要经济合理地选择和使用一个地基，就必须进行钻探和土壤试验（有时尚须做工地荷载试验），籍以全面了解地基土壤的情况。
    目前地基勘察工作远远不能适应基本建设的需要。几年来，忽视地基勘察工作的许多教训，虽然已唤起许多基本建设的领导干部开始注意地基勘察工作，但还有些领导干部对地基勘察工作的重视一直停留在口头上，有些基本建设部门至今尚无勘察机构，更普遍的是缺乏对地基勘察工作的具体领导。
    为改变地基勘察工作的落后状态，勘察单位首先要解决力量与任务的矛盾。目前勘察技术力量十分薄弱，技术干部多半是由其他技术工种转业过来的，人数也很少。因此，一方面要加强政治思想领导，巩固已有人员的专业思想，使他们充分认识自己工作的重要性，安于新的岗位，并组织他们深入钻研，努力学习苏联先进经验；另一方面，要设置短期训练班，培养初级和中级技术人员，以壮大力量，适应国家的需要。
    其次，工程地基勘察工作要按一定的程序进行。城市建筑中地基的选择，虽常受到土地面积和都市计划的限制，但并不能因此而放弃地基勘察的一定程序。我们必须先做初步勘察，建筑设计者可以根据初步勘察的资料，来选择适当的地基，进行平面布置；在平面布置设计好，建筑物的位置已经确定以后，为进一步了解地基的性质，就必须进行技术勘察，根据技术勘察进行地基的设计。如果忽视初步勘察，就容易造成浪费，返工，延误工期等恶果。北京某学院的一个宿舍工程没有作初步勘察，就布置了建筑物，经钻探后，发现接近地面有一层一公尺厚的有机软粘土，需要打桩加固或者搬家，后经业主要求，先后迁地钻探六次，化费了钻探试验费一亿多元，还耽误了工期。
    第三、工程地基勘测要与设计密切配合。工程地基勘察工作是为设计服务的，地基的资料必须充分满足设计的要求，设计人员也必须合理地充分地使用这些资料。有些设计者忽视初步勘察的建议，依然把建筑物布置在土壤较坏的地区，这就浪费了勘察资料，失去了初步勘察的意义。又由于地基的性质对结构的形式和建筑物的使用有很重要的关系，所以地基勘察负责者必须全盘了解上层建筑物的详细情况。如果脱离了上层建筑物来做地基的设计，必定事倍功半。因此地基勘察部门在接受任务之前，应该要求设计部门供给详细的资料。
    设计部门在获得技术勘测资料后，就要着手进行基础的设计，如果建筑物是一个多层楼房或重型厂房，在考虑沉陷、土壤耐压力、以及土壤对于基础的反力等问题上，土壤工作者与设计工作者必须密切配合，才能设计出一个经济合理的基础。地基和基础既是相互影响，有着密切关系，我们认为地基和基础的设计，由一个部门来负责，有许多便利和好处。即或由设计部门将上部结构交给勘察部门进行勘察和基础设计；或者由设计部门直接根据设计需要，做出地基勘察计划，交给钻探队和试验室执行，取得资料后，由设计部门一并解决地基和基础问题。
    第四、健全工程地基勘测的组织。处理一个地基，一般分野外钻探、室内试验与地基设计两个步骤。野外钻探和室内试验是为供给有关地基情况的详尽资料，地基设计是根据资料来进行分析，决定地基的耐压强度、基础的形式及合理的砌置深度和分析判断建筑物可能发生的下沉等。
    为了第一个目的，必须设置钻探队和试验室，为了第二个目的，必须设置技术组。钻探队的任务，是在指定的地区内进行钻探，采取土壤的试样，以供试验。土壤是由矿物固体、空气及水组成的，在钻探取样过程中，很容易把试样压缩，或跑掉一部分水分，而失去其原来的天然性质，所以钻探队的一个重要任务，就是设法取得结构未被扰动的原状土样，这就需要依靠良好的钻探工具和熟练的技术工人。土壤试验室的主要任务是分析土样。一般建筑物和普通地基，只做物理性试验即够了，遇到高层建筑、重型厂房或特殊的建筑物，就需要加做力学性试验。试验室的仪器和人力的配备，要和钻探队的每日出土量配合。技术组的工作是接受任务，制定勘察计划，下达任务给钻探队和土壤试验室，检查工地及综合地质和试验资料，提出勘察报告（包括地基设计及基础建议），并在基础施工前检验槽底。
    目前地质勘测的组织是分散的，各个基本建设单位各搞一摊，本来已很薄弱的技术力量，分散后更形薄弱；而且不能充分地利用现有人力和设备，使得同一时期内，有的忙不过来，有的窝工。为充分发挥现有力量，应该有计划地逐步由分散过渡到集中。
    最后，必须加强学习苏联先进经验。苏联地基与基础科学有着卓越的成就，苏联关于地基方面的学说，完全是结合实际施工，经过实践验证的理论。苏联在这方面出版了很多专门书籍。基本建设的领导部门和研究教育部门，应组织力量从事翻译和出版，借以提高勘察工作者的理论和技术水平。
