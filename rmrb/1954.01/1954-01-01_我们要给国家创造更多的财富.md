    We Must Create More Wealth for the Country
    Huang Yuzhen Group, National Textile Model of the State-owned Northwest First Cotton Textile Factory
    In the first year of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan, thousands upon thousands of worker brothers and sisters across the country won victories on the production front. Our state-owned Northwest First Cotton Textile Factory also completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule in mid-December. Our group's annual production plan was also completed ahead of schedule in early December, increasing production and saving more than 230 million yuan for the country.
    The victorious year of 1953 has passed, and the year of 1954, filled with new hope and new victories, has arrived. We welcome the New Year with joy, and under the shining light of the general line of the country's transition period, we have greater confidence in continuing to improve our production on the current basis.
    We are all young workers who have only been in the factory for more than a year. Compared with the old workers, our skills are very low. But we are all clear in our hearts that to improve production and complete the plan, we must work hard to learn advanced experience, improve personal operating skills, help each other, and learn from each other. Last year, we enriched the content of the production meeting in our group; we established a technical mutual aid group, which played a significant role in increasing the output and quality of yarn. Song Chunying is good at changing roving, Huang Yuzhen and Cao Guifang patrol regularly, Li Guihua doffs quickly, Zhao Yingtao has fewer yarn breaks, and Zhang Jincai is meticulous and conscientious. We often introduce everyone's experience at group meetings, and everyone can humbly learn from others' strengths and gradually overcome their own shortcomings. After the Chongqing Chen Shulan doffing method was promoted in our group, our doffing time was reduced from 40 seconds to about 30 seconds. We understand that to complete the country's production plan, we must first complete the individual and group plans. After the launch of the production increase and economy campaign last September, we studied the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League's "May Day" letter to miners and factory members and the experience of the Tianjin Wang Yuzhen group in formulating group work plans in the League and in the group. In the past, some people said: There are thousands upon thousands of workers in the country. What does it matter if one person does not complete the plan, like a grain of rice falling into the sea! After studying, no one said that anymore. If someone produces more leather roller waste or spins bad yarn in a day, they feel uncomfortable, even without being told. Everyone tries to find ways to avoid producing bad yarn, and even if bad yarn is produced, they try to "recover" it and never throw it away casually. In the production increase and economy competition, the average number of spindles watched by each person in our group increased from 506 to 876. Cheng Xin, Han Shuxia, and Li Huiqing, who only came to the factory in January, also increased from watching 400 spindles to 800. Song Chunying, Qin Huaixiao, and Liu Xiuhua can now watch 1,200 spindles, and the leather roller waste is only 0.32 percent. An old master said to us: Before liberation, in some yarn factories managed by bureaucratic capitalists, three or five people could only watch 420 spindles. At first, we thought he was joking, but after inquiring, the master said that what he said was not false at all. How different is the new China from the old society! However, we are not complacent because of this. We can watch 1,200 spindles, but we are still 200 less than Comrade Han Guihua, who is famous throughout the country! And we are much less than the Soviet elder sisters.
    In the past year or so, our cultural level has also improved significantly. In July last year, the whole group entered the workers' spare-time school. Song Chunying and Liu Xiuhua, who were illiterate before, now know five or six hundred characters. Many people who only knew a few characters in the past have also learned to write letters and can read magazines such as "Northwest Worker" and "Worker Literature and Art". Huang Yuzhen, Li Jinxiu, Cheng Xin, Cao Guifang, Li Huiqing, and others have all finished reading "Zoya and Shura's Story" and "How Steel Was Tempered". We all know that we must have advanced ideas to realize an advanced plan. With the improvement of our language knowledge, we have further understanding of the significance of being masters of our own affairs and defending peace. The heroic deeds of volunteer combat heroes Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, and Cai Jintong have been constantly encouraging us through the several transmissions of the volunteer army returning delegation and the explanations of the responsible comrades in the factory. Recently, the whole group has generally studied Comrade Wu Yunduo's "Dedicate Everything to the Party". Everyone said, "Comrade Wu Yunduo is a worker, and we are also workers. If Comrade Wu Yunduo can dedicate everything to the Party, why can't we?" We must learn from Comrade Wu Yunduo's spirit of hard work, endurance, and overcoming difficulties. Now, eight people in our group have joined the Communist Youth League, and one person has been promoted to doffing leader. Everyone listens to the Party, and the whole group is as united as one person.
    In the past few days of the New Year, our group also held a meeting to discuss how to complete the 1954 production plan. We know that although we have achieved some results in 1953, this is still far from the country's requirements for us. To make our motherland's first Five-Year Plan a success, we must make greater efforts in our positions, further overcome shortcomings, learn advanced experience, strengthen technical mutual assistance, and constantly improve our technical level, and strive to over fulfill the plan on a weekly and daily basis to create more wealth for the country.

    我们要给国家创造更多的财富
    国营西北第一棉纺织厂全国纺织模范　黄玉珍小组
    祖国第一个五年计划开始的头一年，全国千千万万的工人兄弟姊妹们，都在生产战线上打了胜仗。我们国营西北第一棉纺织厂也在十二月中旬提前完成了全年生产计划。我们小组的全年生产计划也在十二月初提前超额完成，给国家增产节约了二亿三千多万元。
    一九五三年胜利地过去了，充满着新的希望和新的胜利的一九五四年来到了。我们怀着愉快的心情迎接新年的到来，在国家过渡时期的总路线的光辉照耀下，我们有更大的信心把我们的生产在现在的基础上继续提高。
    我们都是到工厂才一年多的青年工人，比起老工人来，我们的技术都很低。但是我们心里都清楚，要提高生产，完成计划，就要努力学习先进经验，提高个人的操作技术，互相帮助，互相学习。去年我们小组里充实了生产会议的内容；成立了技术互助组，对提高纱的产量和质量起了很大作用。宋春英粗纱换得好，黄玉珍、曹桂芳巡回有规律，李桂花落纱快，赵英桃断头少，张金财工作细致认真，我们就经常在小组会上介绍大家的经验，每个人都能虚心学习别人的特长，逐渐克服了自己的缺点。重庆陈树兰落纱工作法在我们小组里推广后，我们的落纱时间就从四十秒降低到三十秒左右。我们懂得要完成国家的生产计划，就一定要先完成个人和小组的计划。去年九月增产节约运动开展后，我们在团内、小组里学习了青年团中央“五一”节告工矿团员书和天津王玉珍小组制订小组作业计划的经验。过去有人说：全国千千万万工人，一个人完不成计划，像大海里掉下一粒米一样，有啥关系呀！经过学习后，也再不这样说了。如果有人一天多出了皮辊花或纺了坏纱，不用别人说，自己心里就难受得不行。大家都尽量想办法不出坏纱，就是出了坏纱也要利用它“生头”，绝不随便扔掉。在增产节约竞赛中，我们小组的看锭能力平均每人由五百零六个提高到八百七十六个。一月份才到工厂的程新、韩淑霞、李惠卿，也从看四百个锭子提高到八百个。宋春英、秦怀孝、刘秀花三人已经能看一千二百个锭子，皮辊花只出到百分之零点三二。一位老师傅对我们说：解放前，有些官僚资本家管理的纱厂，三个人或五个人才能看四百二十个锭子。起先，我们只当他说笑话，后来一打听，老师傅说的话一点也不假。新中国和旧社会显得多么不同啊！可是，我们并不因此骄傲自满。我们能看一千二百个锭子，比起全国出名的韩桂花同志，还少二百个哩！比起苏联老大姐就少得更多了。
    一年多来，我们的文化程度也有显著的提高。去年七月间，全组都进了职工业余学校。从前不识字的宋春英、刘秀花，现在都认识了五、六百字，好多过去只认得几个字的人，也都学会了写信，还能看杂志“西北工人”和“工人文艺”，黄玉珍、李金秀、程新、曹桂芳、李惠卿等都看完了“卓娅和舒拉的故事”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”。我们都知道：有了先进计划还要有先进的思想才能实现。随着语文知识的提高，我们对当家作主、保卫和平的意义也有了进一步的了解。志愿军战斗英雄黄继光、邱少云、蔡金同等人的英勇事迹，经过志愿军归国代表团的几次传达和厂里负责同志的讲解，经常鼓励着我们。最近全组又普遍地学习了吴运铎同志写的“把一切献给党”，大家都说：“吴运铎同志是工人，咱们也是工人，吴运铎同志能把一切献给党，我们就不能够吗？”我们一定要学习吴运铎同志吃苦耐劳、克服困难的精神。现在我们小组已经有八个人参加了青年团，一个人被提升为落纱长，人人都听党的话，全组团结得就像一个人一样。
    新年的前几天，我们小组还开了会，大家讨论怎样完成一九五四年的生产计划。我们知道，我们在一九五三年虽然已经得到了些成绩，但是这和国家对我们的要求还相差很远，要使我们祖国的第一个五年计划胜利地实现，我们要在自己的岗位上作更大的努力，进一步地克服缺点、学习先进经验，加强技术互助，不断地提高技术水平，争取按周按日超额完成计划，为国家创造更多的财富。
