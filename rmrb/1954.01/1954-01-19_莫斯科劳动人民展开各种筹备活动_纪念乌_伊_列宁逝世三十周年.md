The Stalin Automobile Factory held symposiums these days to discuss Lenin's life and great revolutionary achievements. The Ilyich Factory, where Lenin delivered a speech in 1918, is preparing to hold a symposium for young workers, inviting older workers who heard Lenin's speech to report on the circumstances of Lenin's speech at the factory.

    In recent days, tens of thousands of Muscovites have flocked to places related to Lenin for visits. On Red Square, countless workers, Soviet soldiers, and intellectuals lined up in long rows to pay homage to the Mausoleum of V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin. People took off their hats and walked solemnly past the crystal coffins of Lenin and Stalin, expressing their deep respect for the two leaders of the socialist revolution. At the Lenin Central Museum near Red Square, a constant stream of people also came to visit the memorials and exhibits explaining Lenin's life and deeds. Visitors attentively watched Lenin's handwritten manuscripts, rare editions of Lenin's works, leaflets written by Lenin, and photocopies of decrees. On the 17th (Sunday) alone, more than 5,000 people visited the Lenin Central Museum, including factory workers, young students, and working people from cities near Moscow.

    纪念乌·伊·列宁逝世三十周年
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科劳动人民正在筹备纪念苏联共产党和苏维埃国家的缔造者乌·伊·列宁逝世三十周年（一月二十一日）。莫斯科的工厂、机关以及建筑工地都在准备举行题为“列宁逝世后的三十年，沿着列宁所指示的道路前进”的报告会。斯大林汽车工厂在这几天中举行了座谈会，讨论了列宁的生平和伟大的革命业迹。伊里奇工厂是列宁在一九一八年发表过演说的地方，该厂的青年工人准备召开座谈会，请一些听过列宁演说的老年工人报告列宁在工厂中发表演说的情形。此外，莫斯科各图书馆、文化宫和俱乐部都举办展览会，展出列宁的著作以及关于描述列宁生平事迹的艺术作品和其他作品。
    这几天来，成千成万的莫斯科人纷纷到和列宁有关的地方去参观。在红场上，无数的工人、苏军战士和知识分子的代表排成长长的行列，前往拜谒乌·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林的陵墓。人们脱下帽子，庄严肃穆地走过列宁和斯大林的水晶棺，向这两位社会主义革命领袖表示深挚的敬意。在红场附近的列宁中央博物馆里，不断的人流也涌来参观说明列宁生平与事迹的纪念物和陈列品。参观者全神贯注地观看列宁的亲笔手稿、列宁著作的珍版本、列宁写的传单、法令的影印本。仅在十七日（星期日）一天，就有五千多人到列宁中央博物馆参观。其中有工厂工人、青年学生和莫斯科附近各城市的劳动人民。
