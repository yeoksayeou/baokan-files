　　Shanxi Province Convenes Fourth Provincial Civil Affairs Conference
　　Discussing Strengthening Political Power Construction to Guarantee the Realization of the General Line

How to strengthen political power construction to guarantee the realization of the general line of the state during the transition period? How can civil affairs work serve the general line? Regarding such an important issue, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government held the Fourth Provincial Civil Affairs Conference from December 25th of last year to January 7th of this year. Based on the spirit of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference, it conducted thorough discussions and reached a clear and consistent understanding.

Over the past few years, Shanxi Province has made significant achievements in political power construction. Except for the twelve newly incorporated counties, the people's representative conferences in all counties and cities have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congresses. However, some cadres and masses still have a tendency to neglect political power construction, and not enough attention is paid to how political power in cities and industrial and mining areas can serve production. In particular, the development of township political power construction in rural areas is very uneven. According to the understanding of two special districts in the province, the status of township political power construction can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category is advanced townships, accounting for about 30%. Various systems in these townships have been basically established, and all tasks can be completed smoothly. Agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation organizations have developed extensively. The second category is general townships, accounting for more than 50%. In these townships, various important tasks can be completed, and mutual aid and cooperation organizations have also developed, but the collective leadership of the township people's government is not sound enough, the township people's representative conferences have not formed a regular system, and the township people's government lacks the ability to proactively and systematically carry out its work. The third category is backward townships, accounting for about 15%. In most of these townships, the political leadership is impure, and capitalist spontaneous forces dominate; a few are impure political power organizations, controlled by counter-revolutionaries, reactionary secret societies, or landlord class elements. In these townships, not only has agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations failed to develop, but the phenomenon of class differentiation is also very serious in some townships. The conference, through the inspection and comparison of these specific cases, and the organization of three typical reports explaining the relationship between the quality of political power construction and the development of agricultural production, made the attendees deeply realize the great significance of strengthening political power construction during the transition period.

The conference criticized the ideological tendencies of some cadres and masses who do not value political power construction. The conference pointed out that the reasons for this tendency are: on the one hand, after the great victory in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, some people developed a paralyzing mood, buried themselves in construction, and did not care about political power construction; on the other hand, they did not have a clear understanding of the relationship between politics and economics, and did not truly understand the principle that "without new democratic politics, there is no new democratic economy." For this reason, the conference strongly emphasized the importance of the people's democratic dictatorship during the state's transition period and the guaranteeing and promoting role of political power in economic construction. It mobilized the attendees to conduct repeated inspections and comparisons through specific cases, making everyone realize that during the period of economic construction, the people's democratic dictatorship of political power can only be strengthened, not weakened, otherwise, it will not be possible to transform the old economic organization and new economy, and it will not be possible to carry out socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. The conference believes that it is necessary to further strengthen political power construction, improve the people's congress system, and fully utilize the power of the political power to guarantee the realization of the general line of the state during the transition period.

In order to strengthen political power construction, the conference decided on many specific measures. The conference first required all localities to combine the promotion of the general line and the general election work, and mobilize the people to use methods of recalling comparisons and specific accounting to understand the different political and economic positions of the people in the two different eras of the new and old political power, as well as the different production and living conditions of the people in areas with different strengths of political power construction, to raise the consciousness of the masses and cherish their own political power. Regarding the construction of township political power, it is required to consolidate and develop the first category, improve and upgrade the second category, and rectify and transform the third category. And through the grass-roots election work, focus on rectifying and transforming the third category, as an important preparatory work for agricultural economic construction in 1954. The conference also required that attention be paid to improving the leadership methods of counties and districts over township-level political power and the working methods of township people's governments, improving various working systems of township people's governments, making them a level of government that can independently carry out work, and becoming the actual organizer of the political, economic, and cultural lives of the broad masses of the people. Regarding the issue of political power construction in cities and industrial and mining areas, the conference decided to organize a working group to investigate and study it before holding a special meeting to resolve it.

In addition, the conference also discussed preferential treatment work, and emphasized that it is necessary to implement the policy of mobilizing and organizing the family members of martyrs and soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers to participate in production, participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and gradually integrate the work of tilling land on behalf of others with mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

### 山西省召开第四次全省民政会议  讨论加强政权建设保证实现总路线的问题

　　山西省召开第四次全省民政会议
　　讨论加强政权建设保证实现总路线的问题
    如何加强政权建设以保证国家过渡时期总路线的实现？民政工作如何为总路线服务？对于这样一个重要问题，山西省人民政府在去年十二月二十五日到今年一月七日召开的第四次全省民政会议上，根据第二次全国民政会议决议的精神，进行了充分讨论，并取得了明确的一致的认识。
    几年来，山西省政权建设工作是有很大成绩的。全省除新划入的十二个县外，县、市人民代表会议都已代行了人民代表大会的职权。但在部分干部和群众中还存在着忽视政权建设的倾向，对城市和工矿区的政权如何为生产服务问题注意不够，特别是农村中乡政权建设工作的开展还很不平衡。根据该省两个专区的了解，乡政权建设的状况大体可分为三类：第一类是先进乡，约占百分之三十，这些乡的各种制度已基本建立，各项工作都能顺利完成，农业生产和互助合作组织已大量发展。第二类是一般乡，约占百分之五十以上，在这些乡中，各项重要工作能够完成，互助合作组织也有发展，但乡人民政府的集体领导不够健全，乡人民代表会议还没有形成经常的制度，乡人民政府缺乏主动地有计划地进行工作的能力。第三类是落后乡，约占百分之十五左右，其中多数是政权领导思想不纯，资本主义自发势力占优势地位；少数是政权组织不纯，为反革命、反动会道门或地主阶级分子所把持。这类乡不仅农业互助合作组织未能发展，有的乡阶级分化现象也很严重。会议通过对这些具体事例的检查、对比，并组织了三个典型报告，说明政权建设工作的好坏对于发展农业生产的关系，使到会人员深刻体会到在过渡时期加强政权建设的重大意义。
    会议对部分干部和群众不重视政权建设的思想倾向进行了批判。会议指出产生这种倾向的原因，一方面是在镇压反革命和抗美援朝斗争取得伟大胜利后，有些人产生了麻痹的情绪，埋头建设，不去关心政权建设；另一方面，是对政治和经济的关系认识不清，没有真正了解“没有新民主主义的政治，就没有新民主主义的经济”的道理。为此，会议十分强调了人民民主专政在国家过渡时期的重要性和政权对经济建设的保障、推动作用，并发动到会人员通过具体事例进行了反复的检查和对比，使大家认识到，在经济建设时期，人民民主专政的政权只能加强，不能削弱，否则就不能改造旧经济组织新经济，不能进行社会主义工业化的建设和社会主义改造。会议认为今后必须进一步加强政权建设，健全人民代表大会制度，充分地运用政权的力量保证国家过渡时期总路线的实现。
    为了加强政权建设工作，会议决定了许多具体措施。会议首先要求各地结合宣传总路线和普选工作，发动人民群众用回忆对比、具体算账的方法，认识在新旧政权两种不同时代人民所处的不同政治地位和经济地位，以及政权建设工作强弱不同的地区人民生产生活的不同情况，以提高群众的觉悟，爱护自己的政权。对乡政权的建设，要求巩固发展第一类，改进提高第二类，整顿改造第三类。并通过基层选举工作着重整顿改造第三类，作为一九五四年农业经济建设的重要准备工作。会议还要求经常注意改进县区对乡一级政权的领导方法和乡人民政府的工作方法，健全乡人民政府的各种工作制度，使它成为能独立进行工作的一级政府，成为广大人民政治生活、经济生活和文化生活的实际组织者。对城市和工矿区政权建设问题，会议决定组织工作组调查研究后，再开专门会议予以解决。
    此外，会议还对优抚工作，进行了讨论，强调指出必须贯彻发动和组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人参加生产，参加互助合作组织，并使代耕工作逐步和互助合作组织相结合的方针。
