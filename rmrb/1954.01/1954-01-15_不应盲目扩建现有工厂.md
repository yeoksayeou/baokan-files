    Existing Factories Should Not Be Blindly Expanded
    Li Zhi
    In order to realize the country's industrialization, in addition to concentrating our main efforts on building new enterprises, it is also very important to appropriately expand and renovate existing enterprises. Because doing so costs less than building new ones, and can be put into production sooner, realize investment results sooner, and increase production capacity. However, the expansion and renovation of existing factories must not be carried out blindly. There must be correct guiding ideology in order to make our enterprise renovation and expansion reasonable and beneficial.
    Last year, we went to some renovated or expanded factories to understand the situation and found that some leading cadres of enterprises had two incorrect ideas when carrying out expansion or renovation. One was to ignore existing equipment and neglect improving the management of existing enterprises, regarding expanding factory buildings and increasing equipment as the only way to increase production. The other was the local view of "never asking for help from others," insisting on doing everything themselves even when they should collaborate with brother factories.
    For example, some factory leaders are always clamoring for more equipment. In fact, in their factories, the equipment already exceeds the design specifications, but the production quota has not reached the design requirements. The equipment utilization rate of many factories is less than 50%. One machine manufacturing factory had a lathe utilization rate of only 37%, milling machines 30%, planers 21%, forging equipment 24%, and casting equipment only 7%. As many as 92 machine tools were completely idle. However, this factory still demanded to expand its equipment. Another factory leader kept complaining that the machine workshop was designed too small to complete the production tasks, and even running three shifts a day could not meet the requirements of the assembly workshop. However, after investigation, it was found that in addition to poor production organization and uneven production tasks, there were originally three automatic lathes that had never been started since they were installed in 1951, because of a lack of cam templates and bright bar stock. These automatic lathes are specialized in making standard parts and can produce 7,200 standard parts per day. However, at that time, the factory's standard parts were entirely manufactured slowly by ordinary lathes. According to this factory's approach, even if the number of ordinary lathes were doubled without starting these few modern machine tools with particularly high production capacity, the problem would not be solved. Another factory had more than a hundred pieces of equipment stockpiled in the warehouse, but still reached out to higher authorities to request adding sixty more. When the higher authorities discovered the machines stockpiled in the warehouse, they hurriedly moved them out for installation. Some factories, due to blindly expanding equipment, even squeezed the swivel arm of radial drills over the top of lathes. The passageways between some machine tools were only 60 centimeters apart, with workers working back-to-back, making the originally very reasonably designed workshop cluttered and chaotic. Such workshops of course cannot produce any good products. The result is increased rejects, damaged machine tools, and increased repair rates. The result of blindly expanding equipment did not achieve the purpose of increasing production, but instead caused great waste.
    There are also some factory leaders who have the idea of "rather big than small" and dislike the original old factory buildings, always wanting to build several brand-new, large factory buildings in a short period of time. Some factories have poor production management, resulting in the false appearance of insufficient workshop area; but instead of striving to improve management, they blindly expand the factory area. For example, one factory's responsible cadre said that their factory's machine assembly workshop was designed too small, so they had to expand it by two times themselves. However, after carefully studying the production situation of the workshop, it turned out that the factory's production was uneven, and the various workshops could not deliver parts to the assembly workshop daily and evenly according to plan. A machine could not be assembled if it was missing a small part, so the unassembled machines had to be piled up in the workshop, taking up a lot of space. At the same time, the quality of assembly was poor, and many places did not meet the standards after inspection, so they could not be packaged and shipped out of the factory, and therefore had to be left in the workshop. In this way, of course, the production area would appear too small. If these factories do not improve production management and product quality, the contradiction of insufficient area will probably never be resolved. Some factories have blindly expanded their equipment, so that there is nowhere to accommodate the excessive equipment, and they have to expand the factory area. Or, in order to accommodate the blindly added equipment, they used the workshop office for production, or added two rows of low houses on both sides of the large factory building, blocking the high and bright windows of the factory building, so that workers could only rely on the light from the half-windows and skylights to work.
    The consequences of blindly building factories are, first of all, a serious waste of state funds. Just adding up the equipment that exceeded the design specifications of the few factories mentioned above, the total number reached hundreds of units, with a value of hundreds of billions of yuan. This equipment is idle in the workshop or warehouse, or even piled up in the open air, unable to create wealth for the country, nor can it be distributed to enterprises that need these equipment more.
    Secondly, blindly expanding factories often fails to truly achieve the purpose of increasing production. On the contrary, sometimes because it disrupts the balance of production and violates reasonable production procedures, the factory cannot carry out production normally. We have seen those workshops that have changed their deployment due to blindly adding equipment. The original overall design has been destroyed, and the entire underground cable power distribution system installed according to the design has been abandoned and cannot be used. The factory has erected temporary power and lighting lines, which are extremely unsafe and prone to accidents. The original overhead cranes designed in the workshop cannot be installed, and workers have to continue to lift heavy objects by hand, increasing work-related injuries and greatly reducing production efficiency. The ventilation system originally designed in some workshops cannot be installed, making it very difficult for workers to work and often causing them to get sick, which not only reduces the attendance rate but also impairs product quality.
    The reason for these factories' blind expansion is mainly that some cadres lack a deep understanding of the state's policy of strengthening industrial capital construction. They believe that carrying out capital construction is the only way to improve and expand the production capacity of existing factories; but they have not realized that new construction must be based on existing enterprises, and that the production management of existing factories must be strengthened and the potential strength of existing enterprises must be brought into play to support capital construction. They also did not realize that the state's capital construction is carried out in a planned manner, and each factory must be arranged on an appropriate scale according to the needs of the state, and its development speed must also be adapted to other industries that cooperate with the factory. Greed for more and rash advance, unauthorized and blind expansion of factories, leading to disruption of the state's overall plan, is not allowed.
    Other factory leaders have localist thinking, demanding that their own factories develop faster, be larger and more complete, and are always unwilling to cooperate normally with other factories, but demanding that their own factories become a "not dependent on others", "independent" factory. They do not care about the amount of state investment, nor do they care whether the practice of expanding the factory is reasonable. Here is a typical and prominent example: There were two factories, originally separated from one factory, adjacent to each other, with only different product characteristics. After the split, one of the factories was assigned a casting workshop with a larger capacity; the other factory was assigned a forging workshop. In the design, it was determined that the two factories should cooperate with each other to use them jointly, and production should be carried out by means of this factory managing the other factory's orders. In terms of the production capacity of these two workshops, it was more than enough to supply the castings and forgings required by the two factories. However, due to the influence of localist thinking, these two factories did not supply the castings and forgings needed by each factory on an average monthly basis, but instead "first complete my own, then do the ordered ones," resulting in an imbalance in the production of both factories, and each clamoring to build their own casting workshop and forging workshop, and before the new workshops were built, dividing the two workshops in half, making the original complete workshops with complete sets of equipment into casting workshops and forging workshops each with half incomplete. As a result, both factories still failed to complete their production tasks. In this case, the leaders of these two factories have not yet recognized their mistakes, and are still actively committed to ordering equipment and building new factory buildings. Factories that demand expansion under the pretext of "it is better to do it yourself than to order from others" are not limited to these two.
    In order not to waste the state's precious funds, the above two tendencies of blindly expanding factories should be quickly corrected.

    不应盲目扩建现有工厂
    力之
    为了实现国家的工业化，我们除了要集中主要力量来建设新的企业外，对现有企业进行适当的扩建和改建也是很重要的一个方面。因为，这样做既比新建花钱少，又能早日投入生产，早日发挥投资效果，增长生产能力。但是，现有工厂的扩建和改建决不能盲目进行，必须有正确的指导思想，才能使我们的企业改建和扩建得合理、有益。
    去年，我们曾到某些改建或扩建的工厂里去了解情况，发现有些企业的领导干部在进行扩建或改建时，存在着两种不正确的思想。一种是忽视现有设备，忽视改善现有企业的管理，把扩大厂房和增加设备当作了增加生产的唯一方法；另一种是“万事不求人”的局部观点，应该和兄弟厂协作的，也要自己单搞一套。
    譬如，有些工厂的领导干部，总是嚷着设备不够。其实在他们的工厂里，设备已经超过了设计中的规定，但生产定额却没有达到设计的要求。很多工厂的设备使用率达不到百分之五十。有一个机器制造厂，车床使用率仅达百分之三十七，铣床是百分之三十，刨床是百分之二十一，锻压设备是百分之二十四，铸造设备仅及百分之七，完全不开动的机床竟达九十二台；但是，这个工厂却仍然要求扩充设备。还有一个工厂的领导干部，一直嚷着机器车间设计得太小，不能完成生产任务，甚至开日夜三班，也不能满足装配车间的要求。可是经过调查，发现该厂除生产组织得不好，生产任务不均衡外，原来有三台自动车床，自从一九五一年安装好之后，竟一直没有开动，原因是缺乏凸轮样板和光杆毛料。这些自动车床是专门做标准零件的，每天可以生产七千二百件标准件；但是，当时该厂的标准零件却完全由普通车床慢慢地制造。如果按照这个工厂的做法，不开动这几部生产能力特别大的近代化机床，即算增多一倍普通车床，也解决不了问题。还有一个厂，仓库里积压着百余台设备，却仍伸手向上级请求增添六十台。当上级发现了仓库里积压的机器之后，他们才急急忙忙地搬出来安装。有些工厂，由于盲目扩充设备，竟挤得回臂钻床的拐臂伸到了车床上面；有些机床之间的过道仅隔六十公分，工人背碰背地工作，使原来设计得非常合理的车间被摆布得混乱不堪。这样的车间当然生产不出什么好成品来，其结果是废品增加，机床损坏，反修率增大，盲目扩充设备的结果，并没有达到提高生产的目的，反而造成很大浪费。
    还有些工厂的领导干部，存在着“宁大勿小”的思想、厌弃原有的旧厂房，总想在短期内多盖几幢崭新的大厂房。有些工厂生产管理得不好，发生了虚假的车间面积不够的现象；但是他们不努力改善管理，却盲目地扩大厂房面积。譬如，有一个工厂的负责干部说，他们工厂的机器装配车间设计得太小了，以致不得不自行扩大了两倍。但是，当仔细研究了该车间的生产情况之后，原来该厂生产不均衡，各车间不能按计划地每日均衡地将零件送到装配车间来。机器缺了一个小零件就装不起来，只好将没有装好的机器堆积在车间内，占用了很多地方。同时装配的质量不好，产品经过检验，很多地方不合格，不能包装发送出厂，因此也只好将它们停放在车间里。这样一来，当然会显得生产面积太小。这些工厂如果不改进生产管理和产品质量，面积不够的矛盾恐怕永远也不会解决的。还有一些工厂则是由于盲目扩充设备，使过多的设备无处容纳，不得不扩建厂房面积。或者是为了安置盲目增设的设备，将车间办公室也用作了生产，或者是在大厂房两侧添上两排矮屋子，结果将厂房的高大明亮的窗子挡住了，工人只能依靠由半截窗子和天窗透进来的光线进行工作。
    盲目建厂的后果，首先是严重地浪费了国家资金。仅把前面所说的几个工厂超过设计所规定的设备加起来，总数就达百台，价值以千亿元计。这些设备闲置在车间或仓库里，甚至堆在露天场地上，不能为国家创造财富，也不能分配到更需要这些设备的企业中去。
    其次，盲目扩建工厂常常不能真正达到提高生产的目的，相反地，有时因为破坏了生产上的平衡，违犯了合理的生产程序，致使工厂不能正常进行生产。我们见到那些由于盲目增添了设备而改变了部署的车间，原有的总体设计破坏了，全部按设计安装的地缆配电系统废弃不能使用，工厂架起了临时动力和照明线路，极不安全，常出事故；车间里原来设计的吊车不能安装，工人只得仍用手来抬重活，工伤事故增多，生产效率也大大降低；有些车间原设计的通风系统不能安装，工人工作很困难，常常生病，不仅出勤率降低，而且产品质量也不好。
    这些工厂盲目扩建的原因，主要是某些干部对国家加强工业基本建设的方针缺乏深刻的认识。他们认为进行基本建设是提高和扩大现有工厂生产能力的唯一途径；而没有认识到：进行新的建设是要以现有企业为基础的，必须加强现有工厂的生产管理，发挥现有企业的潜在力量，以支援基本建设。他们也没有认识到，国家基本建设是有计划地进行的，每一个工厂都要按照国家的需要安排在适当的规模上，其发展速度也要与该工厂配合的其他工业相适应。贪多冒进，擅自盲目扩充工厂，以致打乱了国家整体计划的行为，是不能容许的。
    另外一些工厂的领导干部，则是存在着本位主义思想，要求自己的工厂发展得迅速些，庞大些和完整些，总是不愿意和其他工厂正常地协作，而要求自己的工厂成为一个“不依赖他人”、“独立自主”的工厂。他们不顾及国家投资的多少，也不顾及扩充工厂的做法是否合理。这里举一个典型的突出的例子：有两个工厂，原来是由一个工厂分开的，两厂相邻，仅产品性质不同。分厂以后，其中一个工厂分有一个能力较大的铸造车间；另一工厂分有一个锻造车间。在设计中，确定两个工厂相互配合共同使用，采取这厂经营他厂订货的方式进行生产。就这两个车间的生产能力来说，供应两个厂所需的铸件和锻件是绰绰有余的。但是，由于本位主义思想作祟，这两个工厂不是每月平均供应各厂所需要的铸件和锻件，而是“先完成我自己的，再做订货的”，结果使得两厂生产都不平衡，各自嚷着要建造自己的铸造车间和锻造车间，并在新车间未建立之前，将两个车间各自分得一半，使原来完整的具有成套设备的车间，成了各有一半的残缺不全的铸造车间和锻造车间。结果，两厂都仍旧完不成生产任务。在这种情况下，这两个工厂的领导干部还没有认识到自己的错误，还在各自积极地致力于订购设备，盖新厂房。类似这种以“向人家订货不如自己做”为借口要求扩展的工厂，并不只是这两个。
    为了不致浪费国家的宝贵资金，上述这两种盲目扩展工厂的倾向，应当迅速地加以纠正。
