Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th: The U.S. side's heinous plan to use force to kidnap more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war (POWs) from the Tongchang-ri camp is ready. U.S. Eighth Army Commander General Taylor arrived in Tokyo by plane on the 7th. His main purpose this time is to hand over his "final plan" for the kidnapping of POWs to U.S. Far East Commander General Hull.

Taylor is evidently very afraid that POWs might take the opportunity to escape to the Korean and Chinese side's area when they are moved out of the neutral nations' custodial camps. According to the Associated Press, he formulated this sinister plan to prevent "the phenomenon of rushing outwards" that would occur when POWs were moved out of the camps. According to this plan, the U.S. side has built a "huge barbed wire tunnel" several miles long between Tongchang-ri and Munsan. After the POWs are moved out of the POW camp, U.S. Marines and South Korean soldiers will drive the POWs along this "tunnel" to the camps where they will be imprisoned. Searchlights and loudspeakers have been installed on this road to prevent POWs from escaping in the dark.

According to the Associated Press, when the POWs are being escorted south after being moved out of the camp, the Eighth Army's loudspeakers will also broadcast to the agents posing as "POWs," ordering them to "pick out the enemies among you." This is clearly an order to the agents to further persecute POWs who attempt to resist the U.S. plot to kidnap POWs and escape to the Korean and Chinese side's area. The Eighth Army authorities also plan to "specially isolate" those POWs who firmly oppose the U.S.'s forcible detention in order to continue persecuting them.

At the same time, the Li and Chiang gangs are also stepping up preparations to forcibly incorporate the kidnapped POWs into the army to serve as cannon fodder. According to Reuters, "The South Korean army will provide them with food and transportation and send them to Daegu and Pohang in the south." According to U.S. news agencies, Li's puppet foreign minister, Byun Young-tae, openly said, "The South Korean Ministry of National Defense is making the necessary arrangements to take care of the POWs after they are released." According to the Associated Press, the Chiang gang has "agreed that the United Nations Command will be responsible for transportation until the POWs are sent to Taiwanese ports." They are "accelerating" their "preparatory work" to force POWs to serve as cannon fodder. The Associated Press said that after the POWs are kidnapped to Taiwan, they will "attend political classes," and "then they will have the opportunity to join the army."

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th: The U.S. military authorities, colluding with the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang gangs, are making hurried arrangements in an attempt to realize their conspiracy to kidnap Korean and Chinese POWs in the Tongchang-ri camp on January 23 as planned.

Before U.S. Eighth Army Commander General Taylor went to Tokyo with the so-called "final plan" for kidnapping POWs to discuss with U.S. Far East Commander General Hull, he made a statement in Seoul, admitting that he had discussed specific methods of kidnapping POWs with Syngman Rhee. Taylor said: "We have had friendly discussions and consultations on how we will take over the POWs."

At the same time, according to the Associated Press, the U.S. military authorities have prepared ships in Incheon Port on the west coast of Korea in order to "transport south" the Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs who have been forcibly detained. Under U.S. instigation, the Kuomintang gang is also stepping up preparations for its plan to "receive" these POWs. The Kuomintang gang will soon send a so-called "military delegation" to Korea to arrange specific steps for kidnapping POWs to Taiwan with the U.S. military. It has been revealed that many officials from the U.S. military headquarters are also preparing to go to Taipei to personally "participate" in arranging the "reception" plan for the POWs.

While the U.S. side is openly preparing to forcibly detain POWs, it is also instructing the Chiang Kai-shek gang to fabricate rumors to confuse the public. On the 7th, the Associated Press quoted a "message" from Chiang's secret service agency as saying that "the Chinese Communists will try to seize" all Chinese POWs in Korea, "if the plan is implemented and they are released as civilians on January 22." This shameless rumor-mongering by the U.S. side is obviously intended to cover up its criminal act of kidnapping POWs and to lay a trap in advance in an attempt to shift the responsibility to the Korean and Chinese side if the situation becomes serious.

    美方勾结李蒋匪帮加紧准备劫夺朝中战俘
    【新华社开城八日电】美方用武力劫夺东场里的两万多名朝中被俘人员的罪恶计划已经准备好了。美军第八军军长泰勒已在七日乘飞机到达东京。他这一次主要是把他的劫夺战俘的“最后计划”交给远东美军总司令赫尔。
    泰勒显然十分害怕战俘被劫出中立国看管营场时会乘机逃到朝中方面的地区来。据合众社报道，他制订出这个罪恶计划，是为了防止战俘被劫出营场时“会发生的那种往外乱冲的现象”。根据这个计划，美方在东场里与汶山之间修筑了一条数英里长的“巨大的铁丝网的甬道”。在战俘被劫出战俘营后，美国海军陆战队和南朝鲜士兵将顺着这条“甬道”把战俘驱赶到囚禁他们的营场里去。在这条道路上已安装了探照灯和扩音器，使得战俘不能在黑夜中逃跑。
    据美联社报道，在战俘被劫出营场押解南下时，第八军的扩音器还将对冒充“战俘”的特务分子进行广播，命令他们“把你们之间的敌人挑出来”。这显然是命令特务分子对企图反抗美方劫夺战俘阴谋和逃到朝中方面地区来的战俘进一步进行迫害。第八军当局还准备把这些坚决反对美方强迫扣留的战俘“予以特别隔离”，以便继续迫害他们。
    同时，李、蒋匪帮也正在加紧准备把劫夺出来的战俘强迫编到军队里去充当炮灰。据路透社报道，“南朝鲜陆军将供给他们粮食和交通工具，并把他们送到南部的大邱和浦项去。”据美国通讯社报道，李匪外务部长官卞荣泰公开地说，“韩国国防部正在进行必要的安排，以便在战俘获得释放以后予以照料。”据合众社报道，蒋匪帮已经“赞成在战俘们被送往台湾港口以前一直由联合国司令部担负运输工作”。他们正在“加速”进行强迫战俘充当炮灰的“准备工作”。合众社说，战俘被劫往台湾后，将要“听政治课”，“随后他们将有机会参加军队”。
    【新华社开城八日电】美国军事当局勾结李承晚和国民党匪帮正在进行匆忙的布置，企图按照预定计划在一月二十三日实现其劫夺东场里营地朝中战俘的阴谋。
    美国第八军军长泰勒在携带劫夺战俘的所谓“最后计划”前往东京和远东美军总司令赫尔商谈之前，曾在汉城发表谈话，承认已和李承晚商定劫夺战俘的具体办法，泰勒说：“我们已就我们将用什么方式接管战俘问题进行了友好的讨论和商谈。”
    同时，据合众社消息，美国军事当局已在朝鲜西岸仁川港准备好船只，以便届时把强迫扣留下来的中国人民志愿军战俘“向南运送”。在美国指使下，国民党匪帮也正在加紧准备“接收”这些战俘的计划。国民党匪帮即将派遣所谓“军事代表团”前往朝鲜和美国军方安排把战俘劫往台湾的具体步骤。据透露，美军司令部的许多官员还准备到台北去亲自“参预”安排战俘的“接收”计划。
    美方一面彰明较著地准备强迫扣留战俘，一面却授意蒋介石匪帮捏造谣言来混淆视听，美联社七日转引蒋匪特务通讯社的“消息”说“中共将设法夺取”在朝鲜的全部中国战俘，“如果贯彻计划而在一月二十二日把他们释放为平民的话”。美方的这种无耻造谣显然是为了掩饰它劫夺战俘的罪恶勾当，并预先打下埋伏，企图在事态严重化之后，把责任推卸给朝中方面。
