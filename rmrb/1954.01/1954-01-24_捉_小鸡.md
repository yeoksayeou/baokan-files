    Catching "Chicks"
    Yan Keyun
   In the deep night of July 9, 1948, our troops were in a forced march to pursue and strike the retreating enemy, arriving at Zhangwangji. Zhangwangji was a famous "medicine gourd" town in Suixian, Henan, large at both ends and small in the middle, about three or four li long. As the vanguard platoon, the first platoon of the second company, entered the western end of the village, they heard dogs barking fiercely on the street, and it sounded like someone was hitting them, making them bark even more fiercely. The platoon leader was afraid of alarming the villagers, so he told the whole platoon to walk lightly and head straight east along the street. As they walked, they vaguely saw a house on the north side of the road with a light still on, and they heard chickens "fluttering" and jumping and squawking. He thought that the old folks in the newly liberated area didn't understand our policies and might be hiding chickens! After walking a few more steps, he suddenly heard a woman's voice crying and shouting: "Elder Brother! Please have mercy! This is a laying hen!" The platoon leader stopped and said to himself, "Which unit is this? Is it forcing people to buy chickens?"
    With that, he and Xiao Wang walked towards the courtyard. As soon as they entered the gate, they saw two fellows wearing boat-shaped hats. It turned out that Kuomintang bandits were here to catch chickens. The platoon leader's eyes immediately turned red. He jumped forward and pinned down the fellow who was crouching down, kicking him in the butt. The fellow had just grabbed a chicken in the coop and hadn't even had time to lift his head when he started shouting.
    "Which company are you from? The battalion commander told me to catch these chickens, what do you want? I'll beat you up."
    When the platoon leader heard these words, it was like adding fuel to the fire. He repeatedly hit him on the back with the stock of his Thompson submachine gun and shouted loudly:
   "Damn it! See who I am!"
    The fellow was in pain from being beaten. He stood up, still muttering:
    "The battalion commander told me..."
    He turned his head abruptly and saw that it was the People's Liberation Army standing in front of him. The guy's face turned green in an instant, and he loosened his hand, and the chicken ran away.
    The other fellow had already been targeted in the chest by Xiao Wang's gun, and he stood motionless.
    The landlady, an old woman, saw this scene and didn't know whether to cry or laugh. She stood there silently, like a dummy.
    From the prisoner's confession, the platoon leader learned that the enemy here was a "relief force" reinforcing the Qu Shounian Corps, which was surrounded by our army on the Longhai Railway. Because they were afraid of an ambush by our army on the Longhai Railway, they took cars from Dangshan day and night, and were camping in this town tonight. The number of troops was two companies plus a battalion headquarters.
    At this time, the battalion commander happened to be coming with the troops.
    The platoon leader reported the situation to the battalion commander. Several battalion leaders and cadres of each company studied the situation together and decided on a way to eliminate the enemy.
    The comrades of the first platoon were resting when the battalion commander sent someone to call the platoon leader and Xiao Wang. After a while, they came back wearing the clothes they had just stripped from the enemy. When the comrades saw them, they all wanted to laugh. Lao Zhang joked:
    "Platoon leader, are you two going to catch big chickens dressed like this?"
    "Don't worry, Lao Zhang! We guarantee to bring back two big chickens." Xiao Wang replied happily.
    With that, the two of them swaggered and wobbled eastward. Suddenly, they saw someone pacing back and forth under the eaves of the house in front. The platoon leader puffed out his chest and walked forward as if he hadn't seen anything. The enemy sentry noticed someone and shouted in a panic:
    "What are you doing?"
    "The battalion commander told us to catch chickens!"
    The sentry didn't ask any more questions. The platoon leader even added in a pretentious manner:
   "Why haven't you changed shifts yet?"
   "Change? Damn it! I've been standing here for more than two hours and haven't seen anyone to take over."
    Before he could finish speaking, the platoon leader grabbed him by the neck, and Xiao Wang quickly snatched the gun. He stuffed the sentry's mouth with prepared cotton, and tied his hands and feet with rope. The guy was so anxious that he shed tears. Xiao Wang said humorously, "Old pal, hang in there! The main force will be here soon and untie you." As he spoke, the battalion commander had already arrived with the troops. They immediately arranged the deployment according to the assigned areas, waiting for the signal to act together.
   "Bang! Bang! Bang!" Three red flares rose, and the second and third companies had already started their actions. The enemies were still sleeping like pigs. Hearing the comrades' shouts: "Don't move, whoever moves will be shot dead!" The enemies were shocked. Some were鑽ing under the bed, and some were trying to run out. Anyone who came out would be shot, and those inside wouldn't dare to move anymore. In less than an hour and a half, the battle in the town ended victoriously. Except for a few enemies who tried to escape and were killed by us, the rest were all captured.
    The next day, the comrades talked about the battle last night again, and everyone laughed happily and said: "Our platoon leader and Xiao Wang are really good, they caught so many chickens overnight!" Xiao Zhang from the battalion headquarters said playfully: "Last night's battle was really like catching chicks!" Everyone burst out laughing again.

    捉“小鸡”
    阎克云
   一九四八年七月九日深夜时分，为了追打败退的敌人，我们部队急行军赶到了张王集。张王集是河南睢县有名的“药葫芦”镇，两头大，中间小，约有三四里长。前锋班二连一班刚进村西头，就听到街上汪汪的狗叫声，而且还像有人在打它一样，越叫越凶。一班长怕惊动村里的人，就叫全班放轻脚步，顺着街直往东走。正走着，忽然隐约地看到路北边有一家人家还点着灯，并听到鸡在“扑楞扑楞”地又跳又叫。他想新区老百姓不了解我们的政策，可能在藏鸡呢！又走了几步，忽听得一个女人连哭带叫的声音：“老总！行行好吧！这是下蛋鸡呀！”一班长停止了脚步，自言自语地说：“这是那一个单位，买鸡还强迫吗？”
    说着就和小王两个人向那个院子走去，一进大门，就看到两个头上戴着船形帽的家伙，原来是国民党匪军在这里抓鸡。一班长眼睛马上就红了，一步跳上去按住了那个正在弓着腰蹶着屁股的家伙，照着屁股就是一脚。那家伙刚在鸡笼里摸住了一只鸡，头还没顾得抬，嘴里就喊起来了。
    “你是那个连的？这几只鸡是营长叫我来捉的，你想干什么？老子揍你。”
    一班长听了这几句话，像火上加了油，就用汤姆式枪托子向他背上连捣了两下，大声喝道：
   “他妈的！你看看老子是谁？”
    那家伙被揍痛了，站起来，嘴里还唠叨着：
    “我是营长叫……”
    猛回头，才看到站在自己面前的是人民解放军，这个家伙脸霎时变青了，手一松，那一只鸡也跑掉了。
    另一个家伙早被小王用枪对准了胸膛，一动不动地站着。
    房东老大嫂，看到了这种情景，哭不像哭，笑不像笑，一声不响地站在那里，像呆子一样。
    一班长从俘虏的口供里，了解到这里的敌人是增援陇海路上被我军包围的区寿年兵团的“援军”，因为走陇海路怕我军有埋伏，就坐汽车从砀山这一带昼夜赶来，今晚也在这个镇上宿营哩。人数是两个连加一个营部。
    这时，营长正好带着队伍来了。
    一班长把情况报告了营长，几个营首长和各连的干部在一起研究以后，决定了消灭敌人的办法。
    一班同志们正坐着休息，营长派人把班长和小王叫去了。等了一会，他俩穿着刚才从敌人身上剥下的衣服回来了。同志们一看都想笑，老张取笑说：
    “班长，你们俩化装成这样，是不是去捉大鸡呢？”
    “老张放心吧！咱保证给摸两只大鸡回来。”小王高兴地回答。
    说完，两个人就大摇大摆，晃晃荡荡地向东走去了。忽然看到前面屋檐下有一个人晃来晃去，一班长就挺起了胸脯，像没有看见什么一样地向前走着。敌人的哨兵发觉有人，便慌张地喊道：
    “干什么？”
    “营长叫捉鸡的！”
    这个哨兵不再问了。一班长还大模大样地加了一句：
   “怎么你还没有换岗？”
   “换？奶奶个熊！站两个多钟头没见带岗的。”
    没等他说完，一班长上去一把卡住了他的脖子，小王就赶忙夺下了枪。用准备好的棉花给他塞住了嘴，又用绳子把手脚绑起来。那家伙急得直掉眼泪。小王很有趣地说：“老总，坚持一下吧！大军来了就给你解开。”说话中，营长已带着部队上来了。立即按划分的地区布置好，等待信号一起动手。
   “叭！叭！叭！”三发红色信号弹升起了，二三连已经开始动作了。敌人还像猪一样睡得正香呢。听到同志们的喊声：“不准动，谁动打死谁！”敌人这才惊慌起来，有的往床底下钻，有的想向外跑。出来的就给他一枪，里边的就再也不敢动了。不到一个半钟头，镇上的战斗胜利地结束了，除了几个想逃跑的敌人被我们打死了以外，其余的全部被我们俘虏了。
    第二天，同志们又谈起了昨晚的战斗，大家都高兴地笑着说：“咱们的一班长和小王真行，一夜捉了多少鸡啊！”营部的小张说起了调皮话：“昨晚的战斗真像是捉小鸡一样！”大家听了又轰的一声笑起来。
