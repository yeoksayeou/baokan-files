    The Great Significance of People's Savings

    In recent years, due to the recovery and development of the national economy, the gradual improvement of people's living standards, and the stability of prices, the people's enthusiasm for savings has also been growing. By the end of 1953, savings deposits in the People's Bank of China had reached over 12.7 trillion yuan, with the number of depositors increasing nearly twelvefold compared to 1951, and the proportion of fixed-term savings deposits also greatly increased. In the future, with the development of the country's economic construction and the improvement of the people's political awareness, the number of savings deposits will inevitably increase.

    Attracting people's deposits through state banks is one of the important and regular methods for the state to accumulate funds for socialist industrialization. The speed of my country's socialist industrialization will depend on many conditions, and the most important of these is the degree of capital accumulation in our country. As everyone knows, building a light industrial factory of even a modest scale requires several hundred billion yuan in capital, and building a large steel base like Anshan Iron and Steel requires hundreds of thousands of billions of yuan in capital. And our transformation from an agricultural country to an industrial country does not mean building just a few factories, but building hundreds and thousands of factories; it also does not mean building just one industrial base like Anshan Iron and Steel, but building many new steel bases. It is conceivable that this requires a huge amount of capital.

    Of course, the accumulation of industrialization funds in our country mainly relies on the internal accumulation of the national economy, primarily within industry itself. That is to say, it mainly relies on improving labor productivity, striving to increase production, strictly implementing economy, and implementing economic accounting systems to accumulate funds. However, attracting people's savings deposits through state banks is also an important and regular method for the state to accumulate funds. A deposit of over 12 trillion yuan, if invested in the textile industry, could build thirty-eight spinning mills with 50,000 spindles each. As long as the people enthusiastically deposit their savings in state banks, even if the amount of individual savings deposits is small, small streams can converge into a large river, becoming a huge force supporting the country's socialist industrialization. Therefore, depositing savings in state banks is a manifestation of the people's patriotism.

    Depositing savings in state banks can also cultivate personal habits of thrift, reduce unnecessary expenses, enable rational arrangements for personal economic life, and increase income and improve living standards. The People's Bank paid out 780 billion yuan in interest and bonuses on savings deposits in 1952 alone. Many workers and staff members, due to regular participation in savings, have reduced waste and received interest, accumulating small amounts into larger sums, thereby increasing their purchasing power for daily necessities. It is clear that participating in savings benefits both the country and the individual.

    Realizing socialist industrialization is the supreme interest of the people of our country today. In order to realize this great cause, patriotic people will use various actions to support the country's construction, and will enthusiastically put their surplus and potentially saved funds into savings. Staff members of people's banks at all levels should also recognize the great significance of attracting people's savings deposits, actively overcome shortcomings in their work on the basis of existing achievements, facilitate depositors as much as possible, develop people's savings business, and strive to accumulate more construction funds for the country.

    人民储蓄的重大意义
    几年来，由于国民经济的恢复和发展，人民生活的逐渐改善和物价的稳定，人民储蓄的积极性也就日益增长。中国人民银行储蓄存款到一九五三年底止，已达十二万七千多亿元，存款户数比一九五一年增加近十二倍，定期储蓄存款的比重也有了很大的增加。今后随着国家经济建设的发展，人民政治觉悟的提高，储蓄存款数字也必将随着增加。
    通过国家银行吸收人民存款，是国家积聚社会主义工业化资金的重要的经常的方法之一。我国社会主义工业化进度的快慢，将决定于许多条件，而其中最重要的一个条件，就是我国资金积累的程度。大家知道，建设一个稍具规模的轻工业工厂，就需要几千亿元的资金，建设一个像鞍钢那样大的钢铁基地，就需要几十万亿元的资金，而我们要由农业国变为工业国，决不是建立几个工厂，而是建设成百成千的工厂；也决不是建设一个像鞍钢那样的工业基地，而要建设许多新的钢铁基地。可以想见，这需要一笔多么巨大的资金。
    当然，我国工业化资金的积累，主要是依靠国民经济内部，首先依靠工业内部的积累。这就是说，主要依靠提高劳动生产率，努力增加生产，严格实行节约，贯彻经济核算制来积累资金。但是，通过国家银行吸收人民的储蓄存款，也是国家积聚资金的经常的重要的方法之一。一笔十二万余亿元储蓄存款，如果投资于纺织工业，就可以建设五万纺锭的纱厂三十八个。只要人民踊跃向国家银行储蓄存款，那怕个人的储蓄存款数目很小，细流可以汇成大河，成为一支支援国家社会主义工业化的巨大力量。所以，向国家银行储蓄存款，乃是人民的爱国主义的表现。
    向国家银行储蓄存款，还可以培养个人的节约习惯，减少不必要的花费，使个人的经济生活作到合理的安排，并可增加收益，改善生活。人民银行仅在一九五二年一年中即付出储蓄存款的利息和奖金七千八百亿元。有许多工人职员，由于经常参加储蓄，减少了浪费，且得到了利息，积少成多，提高了他们对生活日用品的购买力。可见参加储蓄，既有利于国家，也有利于个人。
    实现社会主义工业化是我国人民当前的最高利益。为了实现这个伟大的事业，爱国的人民会用各种各样的行动来支援国家的建设，会踊跃地把多余和可能节约的资金参加储蓄。各级人民银行的工作人员也应该认识到吸收人民储蓄存款的重大意义，在现有成绩的基础上，积极地克服工作中的缺点，尽量便利存户，发展人民的储蓄业务，为国家积聚更多的建设资金而努力。
