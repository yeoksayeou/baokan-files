    The realization of the Korean armistice has brought some relaxation to the tense international situation. Peace-loving people all over the world hope that the Korean issue can achieve a peaceful resolution, so that the international tension can be further eased. However, the road to seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is currently being obstructed and sabotaged by the US side in every possible way. After the US side unreasonably interrupted the bilateral talks on the Korean political conference, it unilaterally announced the termination of the explanation work to the prisoners of war and is actively arranging to seize more than 20,000 prisoners of war who have not yet applied for repatriation and have not been dealt with by the political conference on January 23. This makes the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue more difficult and hinders the further easing of international tensions. This domineering practice of the US side is clearly contrary to the wishes of peace-loving people and countries in the world.
    In order to break the obstruction and sabotage of the US side and promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a statement on January 9 on the resumption of bilateral talks on the Korean political conference. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out: "The fact is now very clear that since the issue of handling prisoners of war and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue both need to be resolved by the Korean political conference, the issue of convening the Korean political conference cannot be delayed any further. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, based on its consistent position of resolving the Korean issue through peaceful consultation, and in order to satisfy the ardent expectations of peace-loving people and countries around the world for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue to ease the tense situation in the Far East and the world, firmly advocates the immediate resumption of bilateral talks on the Korean political conference to quickly arrange the convening of the Korean political conference." This statement by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai once again demonstrated the unwavering and consistent position of our people in seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and striving for further relaxation of the situation in the Far East and the world, and clearly pointed out a practical and correct way to achieve this goal.
    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn propositions on the issue of prisoners of war and the resumption of bilateral talks have significant and urgent practical significance today. Now, US Eighth Army Commander Taylor is stepping up the implementation of the heinous plan to seize prisoners of war. According to this plan, the US side has built a "huge barbed wire tunnel" several miles long in the area from Dongchang-ri to Munsan, and "ships will also be berthed in Incheon Port," preparing to forcibly detain all unrepatriated Korean and Chinese captured personnel on January 23. The Syngman Rhee group is even more clamoring to send troops into the demilitarized zone to open the barbed wire of the Dongchang-ri camp, and if they are prevented from seizing the prisoners of war, "it will be tantamount to resuming the war." A United Press International dispatch from Seoul said that the US military "may not take any action" on this, just as "last summer, when South Korea 'released' 27,000 North Korean prisoners of war from the UN-guarded South Korean prisoner-of-war camps, the US military did not take any action to stop it." This adventurous step by the US side, which is deliberately undermining the implementation of the armistice agreement, is something that anyone concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue cannot but pay close attention to.
    According to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," prisoners of war have the right to listen to ninety days of explanations; the issue of handling prisoners of war who have listened to ninety days of explanations but have not exercised their right to be repatriated should be resolved by the political conference within thirty days. However, the current situation in the southern prisoner-of-war camps is that our captured personnel are under the brutal control of US secret agents and have no possibility of exercising their right to be repatriated. During the ninety-day explanation period, we actually only conducted ten days of explanation work, and more than 85 percent of our captured personnel have not heard the explanation at all. Even the very few of our captured personnel who have heard the explanation cannot freely apply for repatriation under the threat and persecution of US secret agents. Although the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has made great efforts, it has not been able to fully implement the provisions of its "Terms of Reference" in the southern prisoner-of-war camps, and the basic goal embodied in the "Terms of Reference," namely ensuring that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated, has of course not been possible to achieve. The US side's various crimes of using secret agents to undermine the explanation work, obstructing the repatriation of prisoners of war, refusing to isolate explanations, and making it impossible for our explanation work to proceed have seriously undermined the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war in the Korean Armistice Agreement. This has been fully proven in the interim report adopted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on December 27, 1953. Therefore, we firmly advocate that the explanation period for prisoners of war must be supplemented to ninety days, and it must be guaranteed that our explanation work will no longer be obstructed and sabotaged by US secret agents in accordance with the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work"; after the ninety-day explanation period is supplemented, the issue of handling prisoners of war who have not been repatriated should be handed over to the political conference for resolution.
    While undermining our explanation work for prisoners of war, the United States has adopted a policy of delaying and obstructing the convening of the Korean political conference. The US negotiators in the bilateral talks on the Korean political conference did everything they could to make trouble unreasonably and delay the talks, and finally interrupted the bilateral talks with an unreasonable excuse. Due to this practice of the US side, the bilateral talks have been suspended for almost a month. During this period, responsible personnel of the US government have more than once publicly stated that regardless of whether the political conference is convened or not, the US side will seize all our captured personnel on January 23; US representative Dean, who returned to Washington after withdrawing from the bilateral talks with barbaric and unreasonable actions, even publicly declared that the only thing he "determined" in Panmunjom was to unilaterally stipulate the date and place for the US side to forcibly detain prisoners of war in the name of "release." These facts fully prove that the purpose of the US side in interrupting the bilateral talks is to avoid discussing the issue of prisoners of war at the political conference in order to implement its plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war and maintain the tense situation in the Far East and the world. This sinister intention of the United States is already obvious to all.
    The unreasonable practice of the US side in interrupting the bilateral talks has aggravated the serious situation of the Korean issue and aroused the indignation and severe condemnation of fair public opinion in various countries. Fair public opinion in various countries believes that this unilateral action of the US side endangers Korean peace and hinders the further relaxation of international tensions. This has caused the US government to suffer another heavy defeat politically and morally. In this situation, senior officials of the US State Department also complained that Dean "chose the wrong topic when he interrupted the negotiations." Many allies of the United States have also expressed dissatisfaction. A British Foreign Office spokesman stated on December 30, 1953, that he hoped the bilateral talks "could resume before January 22."
    China and North Korea have made unremitting efforts to seek the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and the early convening of the Korean political conference. In the bilateral talks on the Korean political conference, our side has repeatedly put forward reasonable suggestions in order to narrow the differences between the two sides on various issues concerning the convening of the political conference. In the statement issued by our representatives Qi Shifu and Huang Hua on December 14, 1953, after the US side interrupted the bilateral talks, it was also pointed out: "The North Korean and Chinese sides advocate continuing the bilateral talks." And believe that the US government should instruct the US representative to return to the Panmunjom venue to resume the bilateral talks. Now, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a statement advocating the immediate resumption of bilateral talks, and at the same time pointed out that our comprehensive proposal on convening the political conference put forward on November 30, 1953, can be used as the basis for continuing the talks; if the US side has any different opinions on this comprehensive proposal, it can and can only be resolved through consultation in the bilateral talks. This once again demonstrated our sincerity in promoting the rapid convening of the Korean political conference. The US side should realize that their barbaric practice of interrupting the bilateral talks cannot solve any problems. US Secretary of State Dulles stated at the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 7 that "the United States is considering resuming negotiations on arranging the Korean political conference." If the United States wants to get rid of the predicament it has created, it should immediately accept our proposal and resume bilateral talks.
    The US side's interruption of the bilateral talks and the undermining of the reasonable resolution of the prisoner-of-war issue have already caused anxiety and unease among peace-loving people and fair public opinion in various countries. The United Nations, which is responsible for maintaining international peace and security in accordance with the United Nations Charter, should have sought a solution long ago. However, in the past, when the United Nations discussed the Korean issue, it violated the purpose and principles of the Charter. At the manipulation of the US delegation, the seventh and eighth sessions of the United Nations General Assembly refused the reasonable suggestions of the Chinese and North Korean governments and hindered the convening of the political conference. Later, the United States implemented a delaying policy in the bilateral talks, and the United Nations General Assembly also refused to discuss this serious situation and declared its adjournment. This has made the United Nations, an international organization that maintains peace, increasingly degenerate into a tool of the US State Department. This is intolerable to peace-loving people all over the world. Therefore, in order to restore the prestige of the United Nations, which is on the verge of complete loss, it is necessary for the United Nations to take measures quickly to discuss the current urgent Korean issue in order to promote a fair and reasonable resolution. If the United Nations General Assembly decides to discuss the Korean issue, the Chinese and North Korean governments are of course fully entitled to send their representatives to participate in the discussion.
    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement also pointed out: "Seeing from the Korean issue, some urgent international issues in Asia, like some urgent international issues in Europe, have now developed to the stage where they must be reviewed and resolved through consultations among the major powers concerned." This also accurately reflects the actual development of the current international situation and the general wishes of fair public opinion in Asia and countries around the world. Our government and our people, based on their consistent position of adhering to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and all other international disputes through peaceful consultation, fully support the Soviet government's proposal of September 28, 1953, and advocate that a conference of the five major powers of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China should be convened to review measures to ease international tensions. As is universally recognized, not only to solve the Korean issue, but also to solve all urgent international issues, it is very important to have the participation of the People's Republic of China. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov once pointed out: "Reaching an agreement on agreeing to hold a conference of the five major powers with China's participation in itself shows that a big step forward has been taken in the direction of easing international tensions and consolidating peace." Now, under the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union, the meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States is scheduled to be held in Berlin on January 25. The governments of France, Britain, and the United States have agreed to discuss the issue of convening a conference of the five major powers in their notes to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Chinese people unanimously believe that the four-nation foreign ministers' conference leading to a conference of the five major powers with the participation of the People's Republic of China will be conducive to easing international tensions and ensuring international peace and security.
    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's important statement issued on January 9, with its reasonable suggestions and correct propositions on the current issues of resolving the prisoner-of-war issue, resuming bilateral talks, and convening a conference of the five major powers, fully embodies the firm position and determination of the Chinese people to adhere to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and other international disputes. These suggestions and propositions fully conform to the peaceful interests of Asia and countries around the world, and therefore will inevitably be supported by all righteous humanity. If the US government still intends to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, it should accept our proposal and immediately resume bilateral talks; otherwise, it will inevitably bear the serious responsibility for continuing to create tensions in Korea.

### 必须立即恢复双方会谈

    必须立即恢复双方会谈
    朝鲜停战的实现，使紧张的国际局势有了一些缓和。全世界爱好和平的人民都希望朝鲜问题能够获致和平解决，使国际紧张局势得以进一步地缓和下来。但是，目前在谋求朝鲜问题和平解决的道路上，正在遭受美国方面千方百计的阻挠和破坏。美方在无理地中断了关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈之后，又片面地宣布了终止对战俘的解释工作，并正在积极布置，准备在一月二十三日劫夺二万余名尚未申请遣返、又未经政治会议加以处理的战俘。这样，就使朝鲜问题的和平解决更加难于取得，从而阻碍了国际紧张局势的进一步缓和。美方这种专横的作法，显然是与世界爱好和平的人民和国家的愿望背道而驰的。
    为了打破美国方面这种阻挠和破坏，以促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，我国周恩来外长于一月九日就恢复关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈发表声明。周恩来外长指出：“事实现在十分清楚，既然处理战俘问题及和平解决朝鲜问题都有待于朝鲜政治会议来加以解决，所以召开朝鲜政治会议的问题是不容再继续拖延下去的。中华人民共和国中央人民政府本其以和平协商方式解决朝鲜问题的一贯立场，并为了满足全世界爱好和平的人民和国家要求和平解决朝鲜问题以利于缓和远东和世界紧张局势的殷切期望，坚决主张立即恢复关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈，以迅速安排朝鲜政治会议的召开。”周恩来外长这个声明，再一次表明了我国人民谋求朝鲜问题和平解决、争取远东和国际局势进一步缓和的坚定不移的一贯立场，并明确地指出了达到这个目标的切实可行的正确途径。
    周恩来外长声明中关于战俘问题及恢复双方会谈的严正主张，在今天具有重大的、迫切的实际意义。现在美军第八军军长泰勒正在加紧进行劫夺战俘的罪恶计划。根据这个计划，美方已在从东场里到汶山的地区内修筑了一条数英里长的“巨大的铁丝网甬道”，“船只也将泊在仁川港”，准备在一月二十三日将全部未被遣返的朝中被俘人员强迫扣留下来。李承晚集团更是嚣张地扬言要派军队进入非军事区打开东场里营场的铁丝网，如果阻止他们劫走战俘，“那就等于恢复战争”。合众社汉城消息说，美国军队对此将“可能不采取任何行动”，正如“去年夏天南朝鲜从联军看管的南朝鲜战俘营里
  ‘释放’二万七千名北朝鲜战俘时，美国军队并没有采取任何制止行动”一样。美方这种蓄意破坏停战协定实施的冒险步骤，是任何关心朝鲜问题和平解决的人们所不能不要加以密切注视的。
    根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，战俘有权利听取九十天的解释；在听取了九十天解释而没有行使其被遣返权利的战俘的处理问题，应交由政治会议在三十天内设法解决。可是，现在南部战俘营中的情况是，我方被俘人员由于处在美方特务的野蛮控制之下，没有可能行使其被遣返的权利。在九十天的解释期间内，我方实际上仅仅进行了十天的解释工作，还有百分之八十五以上的我方被俘人员根本没有听过解释。就是极少数听过解释的我方被俘人员，也在美方特务的威胁和迫害下无法自由申请遣返。中立国遣返委员会虽然曾作了很大的努力，但一直没有能在南部战俘营中完全执行其“职权范围”的规定，“职权范围”所体现的基本目标即保证一切战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利，当然也就没有可能实现。美方这种利用特务破坏解释工作、阻挠战俘遣返、拒绝隔离解释、使我方的解释工作无法进行的种种罪行，严重地破坏了朝鲜停战协定中关于战俘遣返问题的协议。这在中立国遣返委员会一九五三年十二月二十七日通过的临时报告中，已经得到了充分的证明。因此，我们坚决主张：对战俘的解释期间必须补足九十天，并必须按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”保证我方的解释工作不再遭受美方特务的阻挠和破坏；在九十天的解释期间补足以后，没有被遣返的战俘的处理问题，应该交给政治会议解决。
    美国在破坏我方的战俘解释工作的同时，并对朝鲜政治会议的召开采取了拖延和阻挠的政策。美方谈判代表在关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈中极尽无理取闹之能事，进行拖延，最后更以毫无道理的借口中断了双方会谈。由于美方的这种做法，双方会谈中断举行已经快达一个月了。在这个期间，美国政府的负责人员已不止一次地公开声称，不管政治会议召开与否，美方都要在一月二十三日劫夺全部我方被俘人员；以横蛮无理的行动退出双方会谈后回到华盛顿的美方代表迪安，更曾公开宣告，他在板门店所“确定”的唯一的一件事情，就是片面地规定了美方以“释放”为名强迫扣留战俘的日期与地点。这些事实充分地证明了，美方中断双方会谈的目的，是为了躲避在政治会议上讨论战俘问题，以便实行其强迫扣留战俘的计划，并保持远东及世界的紧张局势。美国的这种罪恶用心，已是人所共见的了。
    美方中断双方会谈的无理做法，加重了朝鲜问题的严重情势，引起了各国公正舆论的愤慨和严厉斥责。各国公正舆论认为，美方的这种片面行动危害了朝鲜和平，阻碍了国际紧张局势的进一步缓和。这就使美国政府在政治上和道义上遭受了又一次惨重的失败。在这种情况下，美国国务院的高级官员也抱怨迪安“中断谈判时选择了一个错误的题目”。美国的许多盟国也表示不满。英国外交部发言人在一九五三年十二月三十日就曾表示，希望双方会谈“能够在一月二十二日之前恢复”。
    中朝两国为谋求一切外国军队的从朝鲜撤退，及朝鲜问题的和平解决，推动朝鲜政治会议的早日召开，曾作了不懈的努力。在关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈中，我方为了缩小双方关于召开政治会议问题的各项分歧，曾屡次提出合理建议。在美方中断了双方会谈之后，我方代表奇石福、黄华于一九五三年十二月十四日发表的声明中也曾指出：“朝中方面是主张继续双方会谈的。”并且认为，美国政府应指示美方代表回到板门店会场来恢复双方会谈。现在，我周恩来外长发表声明，主张立即恢复双方会谈，同时指出我方在一九五三年十一月三十日提出的关于召开政治会议的全面建议，可以作为继续会谈的基础；美国方面对于这一全面建议如有任何不同意见，可以而且只能在双方会谈中经过协商求得解决。这再一次表现了我方促进朝鲜政治会议迅速召开的诚意。美方应该认识到：他们中断双方会谈的蛮横做法是不能解决任何问题的。美国国务卿杜勒斯一月七日在美国参议院外交委员会上表示，“美国正在考虑恢复关于安排朝鲜政治会议的谈判的问题”。美国如果想要摆脱它自己所造成的窘境，就应该立即接受我方的主张，恢复双方会谈。
    美方中断双方会谈，破坏战俘问题合理解决，既已引起了世界爱好和平人民及各国公正舆论的焦虑和不安，按照联合国宪章负有维护国际和平与安全的责任的联合国早就应该寻求解决的办法。但过去联合国在讨论朝鲜问题时，却违背了宪章的宗旨和原则。第七、第八两届联合国大会，在美国代表团的操纵下，又拒绝了中朝两国政府的合理建议，阻挠了政治会议的召开。后来，美国在双方会谈中实行拖延政策，联合国大会亦拒不讨论这一严重情况而迳自宣告休会。这就使得联合国这样一个维护和平的国际机构日益堕落成为美国国务院的一个工具。这是全世界爱好和平人民所不能容忍的。因此，现在为了恢复联合国濒于完全丧失的威望，联合国有必要迅速采取措施，讨论当前迫切的朝鲜问题，以促成公平合理的解决。如果联合国大会决定讨论朝鲜问题的话，中朝两国政府当然是完全有权利派遣自己的代表去参加讨论的。
    周恩来外长声明并指出：“从朝鲜问题看到亚洲方面一些迫切的国际问题，正如欧洲方面一些迫切的国际问题一样，目前已经发展到了必须由各有关大国举行协商来加以审查和解决的阶段。”这也确切地反映了当前国际局势的实际发展，以及亚洲和世界各国公正舆论的普遍愿望。我国政府和我国人民本其坚持以和平协商方式解决朝鲜问题及其他所有国际争端的一贯立场，完全支持苏联政府一九五三年九月二十八日的建议，主张应该召开法国、英国、美国、苏联、中华人民共和国五大国会议，以审查缓和国际紧张局势的措施。正如举世所公认的事实，不仅解决朝鲜问题，而且只要是想解决一切紧迫的国际问题，有中华人民共和国参加都是非常重要的。苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫曾指出：“在同意举行有中国参加的五大国会议这一点上取得协议，这件事情本身就说明已经朝着缓和国际紧张局势及巩固和平的方向前进了一大步。”现在，在苏联的不懈努力下，苏、法、英、美四国外长会议定于一月二十五日在柏林召开，法英美三国政府在致苏联的照会中已同意讨论召开五大国会议问题，因此，中国人民一致认为，由四国外长会议导向有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议，将会有利于缓和国际紧张局势及保障国际的和平与安全。
    周恩来外长于一月九日发表的重要声明，对于当前解决战俘问题、恢复双方会谈问题和召开五大国会议问题提出的合理建议和正确主张，全面地体现了中国人民坚持和平解决朝鲜问题及其他国际争端的坚定立场和决心。这些建议和主张，完全符合于亚洲及世界各国的和平利益，因而必然能够得到全体正义人类的支持。如果美国政府还有意于和平解决朝鲜问题，就应该接受我国的建议，立即恢复双方会谈，否则，它就不可避免地要担负在朝鲜继续制造紧张局势的严重责任。
