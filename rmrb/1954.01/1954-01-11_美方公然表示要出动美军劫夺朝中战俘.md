Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th: Our correspondent reports: The US side now expresses its determination to disregard the solemn agreement between both sides of the Korean armistice and the condemnation of fair world opinion, and to act arbitrarily according to its pre-determined timetable for seizing prisoners of war.

U.S. Eighth Army Commander Taylor, after consulting with his superior, U.S. Far East Commander Hull, announced in Seoul today a "general plan" outlining the specific steps for seizing Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on January 23. Taylor stated that the Eighth Army is prepared to "release" prisoners of war. According to American news agencies, under Taylor's "general plan," U.S. military authorities will use American trucks to transport Chinese prisoners of war to Incheon at a rate of one thousand per hour, then load them onto U.S. Navy landing craft escorted by U.S. military guards and Kuomintang bandit special agents to Taiwan. Korean prisoners of war who are seized from the camps will be transported by train to "recruitment stations" in Gunsan on the west coast and Pohang on the east coast, where the Syngman Rhee gang will forcibly enlist them into the army as cannon fodder. Taylor has unambiguously stated: Korean prisoners of war will "have the opportunity to join the South Korean army." Taylor also announced that the U.S. will send U.S. Marine Corps military police and one hundred Syngman Rhee military police "to take over the guidance and handling of prisoners of war after midnight on January 22" (Associated Press). According to United Press, "If the Indian custodial forces do not release the prisoners of war on January 23, making orderly action impossible, the Eighth Army has another alternative plan in case of a large-scale breakout." At the same time, U.S. special agents in the Dongjang-ri prisoner of war camp are under orders to step up preparations to collude internally and externally to abduct prisoners of war from the camp. The Associated Press news agency makes no secret of the fact that these U.S. special agents, "who maintain strong contact with the outside," "have been planning to do so."

While arranging its "final plan" to seize prisoners of war, the U.S. authorities are once again using Syngman Rhee as a "cudgel" to threaten India and its uneasy "allies," in an attempt to force them to comply with and support its dangerous actions. The Syngman Rhee gang has repeatedly clamored to use force against the Indian custodial forces, and the U.S. propaganda machine is making a big deal out of this. A United Press dispatch from Panmunjom on the 9th said that the Syngman Rhee government has threatened that "if India hesitates, South Korea will use artillery and troops to release the prisoners of war." United Press said that the Indian government's decision on the prisoner of war issue "will cause a huge reaction internationally," and "If (India's) answer to this question is not satisfactory to President Syngman Rhee, it may cause the Korean War to break out again." Encouraged by the U.S., the Syngman Rhee government issued another crazy cry on the 8th, expressing "firm opposition to the armistice." United Press even nakedly stated: Syngman Rhee "will use the prisoner of war issue as a fuse to resume the war against the Communists."

Although the criminal collusion between the United States and Syngman Rhee to seize prisoners of war and undermine the Korean armistice is so obvious, however, another propaganda organ of the U.S., the International News Service, shamelessly said in a report on the 9th: "If the war is to restart on January 23, it will be the communist side that has to launch the war." The reason why the U.S. wants to play this clumsy slander trick is nothing more than an attempt to preemptively shirk the responsibility it must bear for the serious situation it has created and its dangerous consequences.

The Korean and Chinese sides have repeatedly stated that their position of adhering to the "scope of authority" in order to fairly resolve the prisoner of war issue is unshakeable.

    美方公然表示要出动美军劫夺朝中战俘
    【新华社开城九日电】本社特派记者报道：美方现在表明决心不顾朝鲜停战双方的庄严协议和世界公正舆论的谴责，要按照它预定的劫夺战俘的时间表蛮干到底。
    美国第八军军长泰勒在和他的上司远东美军总司令赫尔会商之后，今天在汉城宣布了一项规定一月二十三日劫夺朝中战俘的具体步骤的“总计划”。泰勒表示，第八军已作好“释放”战俘的准备。据美国通讯社报道，根据泰勒的“总计划”，美军当局将以一小时一千人的速度用美式卡车把中国战俘运送到仁川，然后装上美国海军登陆艇由美国军事卫兵和国民党匪帮派遣的特务头目押送到台湾。被劫出营场的朝鲜战俘则将用火车分别运到西海岸的群山和东海岸的浦项等地的“入伍站”，由李承晚匪帮把他们强行编入部队充当炮灰。泰勒已毫不含糊地声明：朝鲜战俘将“会得到参加韩国军队的机会”。泰勒同时还宣布，美方将出动美国海军陆战队宪兵和一百名李承晚宪兵“在一月二十二日子夜过后把指导和处理战俘的事情接收过来”（美联社）。据合众社报道，“如果印度看管军在一月二十三日不释放战俘，使得井井有条的行动不可能，则第八军有另外一个代替的计划，以备大规模越营之用”。与此同时，东场里战俘营中的美方特务正奉命加紧准备里应外合地劫持战俘越出营场，美联社消息毫不隐讳地表明：“和外间保持着坚强的联络”的这些美方特务，“一直在计划这样做”。
    美国当局在安排其劫夺战俘的“最后计划”的同时，再次利用李承晚这根“大棒”来威胁印度和它的不安的“盟国”，企图迫使它们顺从和支持它的危险行动。李承晚匪帮已经一再叫嚣要以武力来对付印度看管部队，美方宣传机关正就此大事渲染，合众社九日发自板门店的电讯说，李承晚政府已经扬言，“如果印度犹豫不决的话，南朝鲜将用大炮和部队来释放战俘”；合众社说，印度政府关于战俘问题的决定“会在国际方面引起巨大反应”，“如果（印度）对这个问题所作的回答不能使李承晚总统满意的话，就可能使朝鲜战争重新爆发”。在美方的鼓励之下，李承晚政府八日再次发出疯狂叫嚣，表示“坚决反对停战”。合众社甚至赤裸裸地表明：李承晚“将利用战俘问题作为导火线，恢复对共产党的战争”。
    尽管美国和李承晚劫夺战俘、破坏朝鲜停战的罪恶勾当已是如此明显，然而，美方的另一个宣传机关国际新闻社却在九日的报道里厚颜无耻地说：
  “如果说战争将在一月二十三日再起，不得不发动战争的将是共方。”美方之所以要玩弄这种笨拙的诽谤伎俩，无非是企图预先推脱对于它一手造成的严重局面及其危险后果所必须承担的责任。
    朝中方面已经一再表明其坚持维护“职权范围”以求公正地解决战俘问题的立场是不可动摇的。
