Renmin University of China Holds Fourth Scientific Discussion Conference

　　Renmin University of China held its fourth scientific discussion conference from the 26th to the 28th. Approximately 300 people attended, including responsible persons from relevant departments of the Central People's Government, presidents and professors from some universities in Beijing and Tianjin, academics, and cadres from relevant business departments. At the conference, a total of twenty-three papers were reported and discussed, concerning the general line of the transition period in our country and the related economic construction and the nature of political power construction.

　　Renmin University of China, based on the experience of scientific research work in Soviet higher education institutions, established a scientific discussion conference system. From 1950 to 1952, three university-wide scientific discussion conferences were held. This type of discussion conference is one of the important forms of scientific activity in higher education institutions. Since the first scientific discussion conference, Renmin University of China has established a regular scientific research work system for the entire university, and many teachers in teaching and research sections have made individual scientific research work plans. After several years of effort, the scientific research work of Renmin University of China has been further integrated with the actual needs of national construction. At the third scientific discussion conference, the report "Research on Rhythm Production Organized by Chart in the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 3" made by Wang Jiamo, a teacher in the Department of Industrial Economics of the university, attracted great attention from various enterprise units participating in the conference at that time and had a significant impact on practical work.

　　In 1953, Renmin University of China further emphasized and strengthened research on practical issues and important theoretical issues. After the university stipulated the scientific research task with the general line of the state during the transition period as the main focus, teachers wrote papers such as "On the Role of the Basic Socialist Economic Law in Our Country's Transition Period" and "On the Issue of the Worker-Peasant Alliance in China's Transition Period." These papers have been reported and discussed at this scientific discussion conference. Over the past year, 399 teachers across the university have been engaged in scientific research, completing more than 100 special research projects. Some teachers, such as Zhong Qifu, Su Xing, and Li Yuheng, have not only improved their scientific theoretical level but also improved their teaching quality by actively engaging in scientific research, initially achieving an organic combination of scientific research and teaching tasks.

　　With the development of scientific research work, Renmin University of China formulated a more comprehensive scientific research work plan last December. The plan identified more than 330 scientific topics. This year, the university has adopted methods for evaluating and rewarding scientific works. All papers and other scientific works participating in this scientific discussion conference will be judged by the school's Scientific Work Evaluation Committee, and outstanding works will be published internally or recommended to national publishing houses for publication.

　　中国人民大学举行第四次科学讨论会
    中国人民大学自二十六日至二十八日举行第四次科学讨论会。中央人民政府各有关部门负责人、北京和天津一部分高等学校校长、教授、学术界人士以及有关各业务部门的干部约三百人参加。在讨论会上，共报告、讨论了有关我国过渡时期总路线以及相关的经济建设和政权建设等性质的论文共二十三篇。
    中国人民大学根据苏联高等学校科学研究工作的经验，确定了科学讨论会制度。从一九五零年至一九五二年，已举行过三次全校性的科学讨论会。这种讨论会是高等学校科学活动的重要形式之一。中国人民大学从第一次科学讨论会起，就建立了全校的经常的科学研究工作制度，许多教研室的教师都作出了个人的科学研究工作计划。经过几年来的努力，中国人民大学的科学研究工作，已和国家建设的实际需要有了进一步的结合。在第三次科学讨论会上，该校工业经济系教师王嘉谟所作“东北机械三厂按图表组织节奏生产的研究”的报告，引起了当时参加讨论会各企业单位的极大注意，对实际工作发生了很大的作用。
    中国人民大学在一九五三年进一步重视和加强了对实际问题和重要理论问题的研究，该校在规定了以国家在过渡时期总路线为主的科学研究任务后，教师们写出了“论社会主义基本经济法则在我国过渡时期的作用问题”及“论中国过渡时期的工农联盟问题”等论文。这些论文已在这次科学讨论会上作了报告和讨论。一年来全校从事科学研究工作的教师有三百九十九人，共完成了专题研究一百多个。其中有些教师如钟契夫、苏星、李聿恒等由于积极从事科学研究工作，不但提高了科学理论水平，也提高了教学质量，初步做到了科学研究和教学任务的有机结合。
    随着科学研究工作的开展，中国人民大学在去年十二月制订了较周密的科学研究工作计划。计划中确定了各种科学专题三百三十多个。今年，该校已采取了科学作业的评选和奖励办法。所有参加这次科学讨论会的论文及其它科学作业都将由学校的科学作业评选委员会评奖，优秀作品并将由校内出版或推荐给国家出版机关出版。
