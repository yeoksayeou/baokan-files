    The Old Yellow River Area
    Our Correspondent Chen Yongjin

    In just two or three years
    In just two or three years, the people of the old Yellow River area in eastern Henan have shaken off a hundred years of dust and sand; in just two or three years, the old Yellow River area, which had rarely or never been sown for a hundred years, has begun to sow wheat, cotton, peanuts, and soybeans; in just two or three years, the fruit trees planted by the people have borne fruit. So many small villages are no longer worlds surrounded by yellow sand, but are hidden deep in dense forests. In the autumn, the farmers here are busy harvesting peanuts, sweet potatoes, and cotton, and some are replanting wheat that has suffered from insect pests.

    The old Yellow River area is located north of the Longhai Railway, stretching from Kaifeng in Henan in the west to Dangshan in Jiangsu in the east. A hundred years ago, the Yellow River roared through here. Many villages were washed away, and the historical city of Yifeng was so completely destroyed that not even a brick or tile remained. Later, the Yellow River changed its course, and this vast area of more than 1.6 million mu was covered with yellow sand. For many years, people on both sides of the Yellow River were reluctant to pass through here because even a small cart could not be pushed through the sandy pits; migrating geese from the south were unwilling to stop here, and small birds could not find a place to perch. In spring and autumn, the yellow wind blew so hard that the sun lost its light, and people had to light lamps in their houses even during the day. People said: "The people of the Yellow River滩 [tān - river beach] do not eat two whole loaves of bread in a year." The seeds sown by hungry farmers had just sprouted when the strong yellow wind killed the tender seedlings. Industrious people endured the oppression of the wind and sand and planted again, but they were killed again, and they could not catch the seedlings even after three or four attempts. Even if they caught the seedlings and harvested some crops, the Kuomintang's man-eating government offices still had to divide them four to six. Hou Bu'an, an honest farmer from Caigang, described the persecution he suffered from the yellow sand. In spring and autumn, the wind and sand blew every day. In a few years, the sand behind his house reached the roof ridge, so he had to move a little further away. The wind and sand kept chasing after him, and the sand piled up, so he had to move again. In this way, his house was crushed by the sand, and his brother was injured. Hou Bu'an had a wife who lived in her parents' home all year round. Only when it was time to sow seeds would her parents send his wife back, and help him plant some land in the yellow sand滩. If he was lucky, he would harvest a few dozen catties. Usually, he couldn't even recover the seeds. Therefore, he didn't count on the six mu of yellow sandy land, but only on the manure cart. He picked up manure day and night, and exchanged the manure for radishes from the landlord. Once, he pushed the manure cart out to sell manure, and a yellow wind blew up, and he didn't come back for two days, so his wife didn't have anything to eat for two days.

    After liberation, the people here changed their appearance under the leadership of the people's government in planting trees. The trees planted in just two or three years already protected them like a wall. The power of the wind was greatly reduced here. When I walked in the windbreak nets planted by them in these two or three years, the wind blew over the treetops, and no sand or dust rose. The forest network composed of willow trees, poplar trees, Chinese locust trees, and white poplar strips has grown more than ten feet high, and some are as thick as teacups. It is these trees that have increased the yield of the land they have been allocated; it is these trees that have made it possible to harvest wheat and various crops in places where even grass was difficult to grow in the past. Old man Hou Bu'an harvested 600 catties of wheat, 600 catties of coarse grains, and several hundred catties of peanuts last year. This small village of Caigang alone increased the land for wheat planting by 300 mu. On the Nansha岗 [gǎng - mound] of Yifeng Village, those more than 500 mu of yellow sandy land can also be sown with wheat. The people here have also planted more valuable things in this old Yellow River area—箥簸条 [bò bo tiáo - Vitex negundo var. heterophylla stalks], which can be used to weave beautiful boxes and baskets in three years. They say that one catty of these stalks can be exchanged for two or three catties of wheat.

    People did not expect, did not expect at all, that the old Yellow River area would change so quickly. In the villages I passed through, almost every household had a wheat straw stack, a peanut pile, and cattle, pigs, chickens, geese, and ducks. People working in the forest network sometimes sang a few lines of Henan bangzi opera, and sometimes stopped to listen to the sound of the Longhai Railway train. They often smiled, thinking about the future: it won't be long before the train carries tractors here, and then we won't need these bulky toys anymore, and this land will become more and more fertile!

      Struggle against Nature

    In the winter of 1949, after the suppression of bandits in Henan Province had just ended, several staff members in gray clothes came to the old Yellow River area of Lanfeng County. They told the masses: only by planting trees on this sandy land can we prevent wind damage, improve the soil, and produce more grain. People felt close to the speeches of the staff members in gray clothes. But some people laughed at them: what's the point of planting those two-foot-long small willow cuttings! Waiting for these little things to grow up to prevent sand and plant land, you'll starve your teeth out; others said, planting so many trees, life will be impossible, in the past, there were no trees in the Yellow River body, and there were so many bandits, once trees are planted, no one will dare to cross the Yellow River body; some people worried that after planting trees, they would have to watch in the river body day and night, in case people stole them, who could afford to compensate? Older people said, I have lived for fifty or sixty years and have never seen trees planted in winter. Si Xuebin, a thin, not-so-tall young man from Dong Village, said to everyone: "Planting trees can't be moved to his house. Now the government sees that we have disasters, planting trees and providing disaster relief, what's wrong with that?" Others also said: planting trees by the public has no harm to our old folks, when they grow up we can sweep the leaves, no worry about not having firewood to burn; besides, in the spring we can pick tree leaves to stave off famine, in the past, the landlord's tree leaves were not allowed to be picked. So, the people of Dong Village began to believe the words of the staff members, and at that time they organized thirty or so people, and everyone elected Si Xuebin as a member of the afforestation committee.

    Afforestation began after the Lunar New Year. At that time, the yellow wind blew so hard that people couldn't open their eyes. Si Xuebin told some of the older people to go home. He said to everyone: we must work hard, if we don't plant trees, the yellow wind will blow endlessly. Those young lads all took off their single shirts and drove willow stakes into the yellow sand in the strong wind and sand. In a few days, they completed the task of planting trees, and everyone received more than fifty catties of rice. Although only a few dozen catties of rice, it was a big deal for the people in the disaster area.

    How much Si Xuebin and those who planted trees hoped that those tree stakes would sprout, they went to the beach to see them every day. One day, two days, one month, two months, the willow stakes finally sprouted, and they were so vigorous. In summer, the strips grown from the willow buds were more than one person tall, and the Yellow River滩 was green and boundless, you couldn't see the end at a glance. In the first autumn, the people on both sides of the Yellow River benefited from these small trees. Almost every household swept a large pile of willow leaves, some to feed livestock, some to burn as firewood. The people along the Yellow River, who had always lacked firewood, began to solve the problem of firewood.

    The winter afforestation campaign of 1951 began again. This year, the leadership did not mobilize, only issued a notice, and people automatically organized themselves. The information about the implementation of land reform further increased the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation and grain production. The comrades leading the afforestation announced to everyone: this year we will elect models, the conditions are: see who builds fast, meets the national standards, and loves the national tree seedlings.

    As soon as afforestation began, it snowed heavily, the ground froze, and it was difficult to drive the willow stakes into the soil. Under the encouragement of Si Xuebin, the masses of Dong Village ran to the beach to plant trees before dawn. Si Xuebin's hands were bleeding from grinding, but he didn't stop. That night, everyone made an evaluation, and the comrades from the forest farm said: no need to argue, the red flag will fall on Dong Village. When planting trees the next day, the ground was frozen even deeper, and no other villages were working. Si Xuebin encouraged everyone to continue planting trees. Some people said: "Si Xuebin, don't show off, no one in other villages is planting, what are we doing showing off!" Si Xuebin said: "These willow stakes will not live well if they are frozen, can't we just use rake teeth to make a hole first, so we can plant them? We are idle at home and cold, won't it be warm if we work?" In this way, the masses of Dong Village were carrying out the work of transforming nature in the vast snow, without even going home for lunch, eating some cold dry food in the snow, and then continuing to work. The director of the forest farm knew that the masses of Dong Village had overcome the difficulty of not being able to plant trees due to the frozen ground by using rake teeth to make holes first, and immediately spread this good method to all the villages, so the masses of each village began to work again. In this heavy snow, the villages along the river滩, under the leadership of Dong Village, completed the winter afforestation work in four days.

    I have traveled more than a hundred miles in the windbreak forest in the old Yellow River area of eastern Henan. The people here love these trees as much as they love their own crops. I have not seen anyone damaging the trees, nor have I seen any traces of the trees being damaged. I only saw some people cutting thatch and sweeping leaves, but they were the duty personnel for forest protection. If someone damaged their forests, no matter adults or children, they would pull him to the district government, and this person would, in accordance with the instructions of the district government, make a self-criticism at the mass meeting and guarantee that he would not have such bad behavior in the future. Protecting the forests has become a habit and a conscious responsibility for the people in this area. Zhang Yu'e, a woman from Xiaoyejigang in the first district of Minquan County, said at the district forest protection meeting: "If our village doesn't do well, we will carry a red flag to you on a table." Cadres from other villages said: "Look, our village will also make a red flag, if you take it away, we will compensate you with trees and make a self-criticism at the conference."

    When Zhang Yu'e checked the forest protection work in her own village and other villages, she often did it on days when the weather was bad or when others were particularly inattentive. Once, when Liuzhuang, six miles away from Xiaoyejigang, was staging a big opera, she and another comrade went to Liuzhuang to check the forest protection work. There was a red flag stuck in the forest network, but no one was watching. The two of them pulled out Liuzhuang's forest protection flag and found the village cadres of Liuzhuang. The village cadres and the duty forest protectors all admitted their mistakes. In the winter of 1951, Zhang Yu'e was less than a month after giving birth, she mobilized and led the masses to protect the forest, others advised her: "Such a strong wind, you can't go out, you won't feel well if you don't stay indoors for the full month." The party branch secretary and the director of the women's federation also advised her to take care of her body and child, but Zhang Yu'e always thought: this is the work of the party, transforming nature is for the happiness of the broad masses!

    Zhang Yu'e's glorious deeds deeply influenced the masses of Minquan County. She was elected as a forestry model of Henan Province last year, and the masses of Xiaoyejigang Township insisted on electing her as the township head no matter what.

      Orchard

    Another thing that the people of the old Yellow River area did not expect at all appeared: on the beach more than twenty miles northeast of Lanfeng County, the people of Yifeng Forest Farm opened up a large orchard. There are various apple trees, as well as various grape trees and pear trees. It takes the better part of a day to walk around here. The grape trees bore heavy grapes last year; the apple trees also began to bear fruit last year. The staff of the forest farm and the nearby farmers have great hopes for this large orchard. When a large number of fruits are produced in three or five years, the masses of nearby villages will have to use great efforts to work here: they will have to weave many baskets to transport the fruits out. The staff of the forest farm excitedly said to me: "In the future, we will build a winery, and people all over the country will drink our wine." The people here also have their own ideals: to plant 50,000 mu of fruit trees in the already grown 190,000 mu windbreak forest network. Their ideals can be realized, because this hundreds of miles of old Yellow River area is suitable for planting fruit trees, and the masses on both sides have the habit of planting fruit trees.

    The staff here have so much affection for this yellow sandy beach. Zhang Xiu钺, a college student who came here the year before last, said: if the party doesn't transfer me, I am willing to stay here for the rest of my life. This kind of love for one's own cause is easy to understand. He worked with the masses and led the masses to plant more than 10,000 apple trees the year before last. These saplings were as thick as a small finger when they were planted the year before last, but now they are as thick as a big thumb and have grown five or six branches. He loves these trees like a mother loves her children, and he nurtures these trees like a mother nurtures her babies. He watches the trees sprout and grow, how can he not love them? The year before last, the Provincial Forestry Bureau asked Zhang Xiu钺 to lead the masses to complete the planting task of 9,500 apple trees in winter. At that time, the ground was frozen three or four inches thick; in order to make the apple trees grow better, they implemented the "imported soil method," opening the thick frozen layer on top, digging out the soil below, and then filling in good soil from other places. A tree strip as thin as thin chopsticks had to have a pit of one cubic foot dug. At that time, it snowed, rained, and the northwest wind blew, and everyone was covered with a layer of ice, but no one felt cold. Zhang Xiu钺 always said that it was no harder than the Red Army's Long March. He often couldn't sleep at night, and ran to the apple orchard to look here and there before dawn. On the last day of 1952, they planted 9,500 apple trees, and he said that this New Year was the happiest New Year he had ever had in his life.

    Spring came, and the small apple tree strips sprouted fresh green buds. He took almost every small seedling to heart, from the south to the north of the field, from the west to the east of the field, he checked and found that only two were trampled to death. Zhang Xiu钺 described his current mood: now he feels that sleeping is sweet, eating is fragrant, and following behind the manure (manure truck for fertilizing apples) truck, he doesn't feel stinky. Zhang Xiu钺 and the staff here think about how to transform this yellow sandy beach better and harvest more things for the country.

    古黄河地带
    本报记者　陈勇进
     仅仅两三年里面
    仅仅在两三年里面，豫东古黄河地带的人民摆脱了一百年来沙尘弥漫的日子；仅仅在两三年里面，一百年来很少和没有播种的古黄河地带，开始播种了小麦、棉花、花生和大豆；仅仅在两三年里面，人们种植的果树结果了。那么多小村庄再不是黄沙包围的世界，而是深藏在密密层层的树林里。秋天，这里的农民正忙着收获花生、红薯和棉花，有的正补种遭受虫害的小麦。
    古黄河地带，在陇海路的北边，西起河南的开封，东到江苏的砀山。一百年前黄河从这里咆哮地流过去。很多村庄被冲走了，历史上的名城——仪封，被冲得连个砖瓦也没有。后来，黄河改道了，这个一百六十多万亩的广阔地带便被黄沙覆盖了。多少年来，黄河两岸的人们不愿从这里经过，因为沙窝里连个小车也推不动；南来的大雁不愿在这里停留，小鸟儿在这里找不到栖息的地方。春秋天，黄风刮得太阳失去了光明，屋子里白天也要点灯。人们说：“黄河滩的人那年不吃两个坯。”饥饿的农民播下的种籽刚发芽，大黄风又把嫩苗苗打死了。勤劳的人们忍受着风沙的压迫再种上，可是又打死，一连三四次还捉不住苗儿。即使捉住了苗，收点庄稼，国民党那吃人的官厅还要和他们四六分。蔡岗的一个老实农民侯步安叙述着黄沙对他的迫害，春天、秋天风沙天天刮，没几年屋后的沙土到了屋脊，没办法只好再搬得远一点。风沙不停地又赶过来，沙土积高了，还要搬家，就这样他家的房子被沙压倒了，他哥哥被砸伤了。侯步安有个老婆，整年地在娘家住，只是到播种的时候，丈人家才把妻子送回来，顺带着帮他在那黄沙滩里种点地，碰巧了收个几十斤。平常，总是连种子也收不回来。因此他不指望那六亩黄沙地，只指望着大粪车。黑夜白天拾粪，拾了粪向地主换些红萝卜。有一次，他推着粪车出去卖粪了，刮起黄风来，两天没回来，他老婆也就两天没有一点东西下肚。
    解放后人民政府领导着这里的人民种树。古黄河地带的人民才改变了样子。仅仅在二三年里面种的树木，已经像围墙一样地保护着他们。风的威力在这里大大地减少了。我在他们这二三年里面所种植的防风网里行走的时候，风从树梢头刮过去，沙尘不起了。那用柳树、白杨树、洋槐、白洋条组成的林网，已经长了丈多高，有的已像茶碗儿一样粗。就是这些树木，使他们分得的土地增加了产量；就是这些树木，使那过去连草儿都很难生长的地方，收获了小麦和各种庄稼。侯步安老头去年收了六百斤麦子、六百斤粗粮和几百斤花生。仅仅这个小小的蔡岗村，就增加了三百亩种麦的土地。在仪封村的南沙岗上，那五百多亩黄沙地，也一样能播种小麦了。这里的人们，还在这古黄河地带栽种了更有价值的东西——箥簸条，三年里面，就可以编制美丽的箱子和篮子。他们说一斤条条可换二三斤麦子。
    人们没有想到，根本没有想到，古黄河地带变得这样快。在我走过的那些村庄上，几乎是家家都有个麦秸垛、花生堆，还有那黄牛、猪群、鸡群、鹅鸭群。在林网里耕作的人们，有时唱几口河南梆子戏，有时停下来听听那陇海路列车的声音。他们往往笑着，想想未来：用不了多少年，火车就把拖拉机载来了，到那时就不用这笨重的玩艺了，这地可越种越肥呀！
      向自然作斗争
    一九四九年的冬天，河南省剿匪刚刚结束，兰封县古黄河地带来了几个穿灰衣服的工作人员。他们向群众说：只有在这沙地上种上树林才能防止风害，才能改良土壤、多打粮食。人们对那穿灰衣服的工作人员的讲话，感到亲热。但也有的人笑他们：栽那二尺长的小柳顶什么事呀！等着这小东西长起来防沙种地，把大牙也饿掉了吧；还有的说，栽这样多树，日子可没法过了，过去黄河身里没有树，土匪还那样多，一栽树黄河身就没有人敢过了；有的人耽心着种上树了，还得黑夜白天在河身里看着，叫人家偷走了，谁能赔得起？上年纪的人说，我活了五六十岁没见过冬天栽树的。董庄一个名叫司学彬的瘦瘦的、个子也不高的青年人，却向大家说：“栽了树又搬不到他家去。现在政府看着咱们有灾，又种树又救灾，有什么不好呢？”别的人也说：公家栽了树，对咱们老百姓没坏处，长大了咱们可以扫树叶，不愁没柴火烧了；再说春天还可以采树叶子挡饥荒，过去地主家的树叶子还不叫采呢。于是，董庄的人们开始相信了工作人员的话，当时就组织起来了三十来个人，大家推选司学彬为造林委员会的委员。
    造林在旧历年后开始了。那时黄风刮得睁不开眼睛，司学彬叫几个年纪大的回家了。他向大家说：我们要努力干，不栽树黄风刮个没头。那些青年小伙子们，都脱得只剩个单褂褂，在大风沙里把柳橛儿打进黄沙里，几天的工夫，他们完成了栽树任务，每人都得到五十多斤米。虽然只几十斤米，但对灾区的人们可顶了大事情。
    司学彬和那些栽树的人们，多么盼望那些树橛发芽呵，他们天天往沙滩上去看。一天，两天，一个月两个月，柳橛儿毕竟发出芽来了，并且还是那样旺盛。夏天，那柳芽长成的条条有一人多高，黄河滩上柳树青茫茫的，一眼看不到头儿。第一个秋天，在黄河两岸的人们从这些小树上得到了利益，几乎是每家都扫了一大堆柳叶，有的用来喂牲口，有的用来当柴烧，向来就缺柴烧的黄河沿岸的人们，开始解决了烧柴的问题。
    一九五一年的冬季造林运动又开始了，这年领导上没有动员，只下了个通知，人们就自动地组织起来了。实行土地改革的信息更增加了群众造林多打粮的劲儿。领导造林的同志向大家宣布：今年要选举模范，条件是：看谁造的快，合乎国家的标准，爱护国家的树苗。
    造林一开始就落了大雪，大地冻上了，柳橛很难打进土里去。董庄的群众在司学彬的鼓动下，天不明就跑到沙滩上植树，司学彬自己手上磨得流着血还不停息。这天晚上大家一评，林场的同志说：不用争啦，红旗落在董庄了。第二天栽树的时候，地冻得更深了，其他的村上都没有进行工作，司学彬鼓动大家继续植树，有的人说：“司学彬你别逞能吧，人家村上都没栽，咱们出那风头干啥！”司学彬说：“这柳橛一冻就不好活啦，咱们先用耙齿打个眼，不就一样能栽吗？我们在家闲着又冷，一干活不就暖和了吗？”就这样，董庄的群众在茫茫大雪里进行着改造自然的工作，午饭也不回家，在雪里吃点凉干粮，接着又干起来。林场场长知道了董庄群众用耙齿先打眼的办法克服地冻不能种树的困难后，马上向各村传播了这个好办法，于是各村群众又开始工作了。就在这大雪天里，沿河滩的村庄在董庄的带领下四天就完成了冬季造林的工作。
    我曾在豫东古黄河地带的防风林里，做了百多里的旅行。这里的人民对这些树木的爱护，真像爱护自己的庄稼一样。我没有看到折损树木的人，也没有看到树木被折损的痕迹。只看到一些割茅茅草和扫树叶的人，他们却是护林的值班人员。如果有人损坏了他们的林木，无论大人小孩见了，就会把他拉到区政府里去，这个人会遵照区政府的指示，在群众大会上检讨，并保证今后不再有这样不好的行为。爱护林木，已经成了这一带人们的习惯和自觉的责任。民权县一区小野鸡岗的妇女张玉娥，在全区护林会议上说：“我们村上要是做不好，用桌子抬着给你们送个红旗。”别村的干部却说：“瞧吧，我们村也做个红旗，你们要拔走了，赔你树还要在大会上检讨。”
    张玉娥检查自己村庄和别的村庄护林工作的时候，往往在那天气不好的日子或别人特别不注意的时候。一次离小野鸡岗六里路的刘庄在唱大戏的时候，她和另外一个同志到刘庄去检查护林工作了。在那林网里插着一个红旗却没有一个人看着。她两个拔了刘庄的护林旗，找到了刘庄的村干部。村干部和值日护林的都承认了错误。一九五一年的冬天张玉娥生孩子还不到一个月，就动员并领导群众护林，别人劝她：“这样大风，可不能出去，不出满月好受病。”党支部书记和妇女会主任也劝她爱护自己的身体和孩子，但张玉娥总是想着：这是党的工作，改造自然是为广大群众的幸福呀！
    张玉娥的光荣事迹深刻地影响着民权县的群众，她去年被选为河南省的林业模范，小野鸡岗乡的群众却无论如何也要选她当乡长。
      果园
    又一件古黄河地带人们根本想不到的事情出现了：在兰封县东北二十多里的沙滩上，仪封林场的人们开辟了个大果园。那里有各种苹果树，也有各种葡萄树和梨树。在这里走走要化大半天的时间。葡萄树去年已结了累累的葡萄；苹果树去年也开始结果了。这里林场的工作人员和附近的农民，对这块大果园抱了很大的希望。等三五年大量结果的时候，附近村庄的群众将要用很大的力量在这里进行工作：他们要为运输出去的果子编制很多的筐篓。林场的工作人员兴奋地向我说：“将来我们要建立葡萄酒厂，全国的人都将喝到我们的葡萄酒。”这里的人们还有他们自己的理想：在已经长成的十九万亩防风林网里再种植五万亩果树。他们的理想是可以实现的，因为这几百里的古黄河地带是适于种植果树的，两岸的群众都有种果木树的习惯。
    这里的工作人员们，对这块黄沙滩是多么的有感情呀，前年来这里的一个大学生张秀钺说：党不调我，我愿在这里一辈子。这种热爱自己事业的感情，是容易理解的，他和群众一起并领导着群众，前年种植了一万多棵苹果树，这些树苗苗前年栽时还像个小手指样粗，现在已像大姆指粗了，并且发了五六个枝子。他像母亲爱孩子样的爱这些树，也像母亲抚育她的婴儿一样的抚育这些树。他看着树发芽、生长，怎么会不爱呢？前年省林业局叫张秀钺领导群众在冬季完成九千五百棵苹果树的种植任务。那时地已冻了三四寸厚；为了使苹果树长得更好，他们实行“客土法”，把上面厚厚的冻层打开，把下面的壤土挖出来，再把别地的好土填进去。像细筷儿样的一个树条条，要挖一立方尺的坑。那时下雪、下雨又刮西北风，每人身上都结了一层冰，但谁也没觉得冷，张秀钺总是说再难也没有红军长征难，他往往到深夜睡不住，天不明就跑到苹果地里这里看那里瞧。一九五二年的最后一天，他们植完九千五百棵苹果树，他说这个新年是他有生以来最痛快的新年。
    春天到了，小苹果树条条发出新鲜的绿芽，他对每棵小苗苗几乎都费了心机，从地南到地北，从地西到地东，他检查着只有两棵被人用脚踩死了。张秀钺描述着他现在的心情：现在觉得睡觉觉甜，吃饭饭香，跟在大粪（给苹果施肥的粪车）车的后面，也觉不得臭。张秀钺和他们这里工作人员的想法是：如何把这块黄沙滩改造得更好，为国家收获更多的东西。
