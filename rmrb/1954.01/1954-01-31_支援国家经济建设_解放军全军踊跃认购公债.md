　　PLA Whole Army Actively Subscribes to Public Bonds
    [Xinhua News Agency] The entire Chinese People's Liberation Army is enthusiastically subscribing to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds, and many units have completed their subscription work ahead of schedule and above the set quota.
    Cadres at all levels of the Chinese People's Liberation Army demonstrated a high degree of patriotism in subscribing to public bonds. The staff of the Southwest Military Region Headquarters, in a very short period of time, subscribed to more than 660% of the estimated subscription figure. Among them, the staff of the survey team who have been working in the high mountains and ridges for a long time, also took out their savings to subscribe to public bonds. The 3rd Company of a certain unit guarding the front line of the East China Sea Defense has subscribed to a total amount more than twelve times the estimated figure. The units of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army completed their public bond subscription tasks ahead of schedule on the 5th of this month. The total subscription amount of the Northeast Military Region Headquarters, Political Department, and other units also exceeded the estimated figure by two to four times. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Senior Infantry School also subscribed to more than 200% of the predetermined figure.
    The purchase of public bonds by cadres at all levels of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was carried out on the basis of vigorously publicizing the general line of the state during the transition period throughout the army. Everyone regards subscribing to public bonds to support national economic construction as an obligation and a glorious right. They said: In the past, we were not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice to fight the enemy in order to realize socialism. Now the time has come to directly support the country in building a socialist society. We must do our best to add a brick and a tile to the country's construction. Teng Guanghui, a cadre of the Northeast Military Region, has always lived a simple life and often saved his allowance to buy savings bonds. This time, when subscribing to public bonds, he again used his savings of 600,000 yuan to subscribe to public bonds. He Bao, a member of the Communist Youth League of the Political Department of the Sichuan Military Region, also used all of his saved one million yuan to subscribe to public bonds.
    The soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also resolutely demanded to subscribe to national economic construction bonds. They said: Buying public bonds is for such a big thing as building the motherland. If we can't buy more, we should buy less. Many soldiers also wrote letters to mobilize their families to actively subscribe to public bonds. Lu Xingjie, a clerk of a certain unit of the Sichuan Military Region, took out 500,000 yuan from the one million yuan he had saved over the past two years to subscribe to public bonds.

　　解放军全军踊跃认购公债
    【新华社讯】中国人民解放军全军踊跃认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债，许多单位都已提前并超额完成了认购工作。
    中国人民解放军全军各级干部在认购公债中，表现了高度的爱国热情。西南军区司令部的工作人员，在很短的时间内，认购的数目已达预计认购数字的百分之六百六十以上。其中，长期工作在崇山峻岭中的测量队工作人员，把积蓄下来的钱，也拿出来认购公债。守卫在华东海防前线的某部第三连，认购总数已超过了预计数字的十二倍。中南军区和第四野战军各部队，早在本月五日就超额完成认购公债任务。东北军区司令部、政治部等单位认购总数也超过了预计数字的两倍到四倍。中国人民解放军高级步兵学校也认购了预定数字的百分之二百以上。
    中国人民解放军各级干部购买公债是在全军大张旗鼓地宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线的基础上进行的。大家都把认购公债支援国家经济建设当作应尽的义务和光荣的权利。他们说：过去不怕流血牺牲和敌人作战，就是为了实现社会主义，现在直接支援国家建设社会主义社会的时期到了，我们要尽力为国家的建设加上一砖一瓦。东北军区干部滕光辉一向生活简朴，经常把自己的津贴费节省下来购买储蓄券，这次认购公债时，他又将节余的六十万元认购了公债。四川军区政治部青年团员何保也全把节约下来的一百万元认购了公债。
    中国人民解放军各部队战士们也坚决要求认购国家经济建设公债。他们说：购买公债是为了建设祖国这样的大事情，咱们不能多买也要少买。许多战士还写信动员家属踊跃认购公债。四川军区某部事务员吕兴杰把两年来积存的一百万元，拿出五十万元来认购了公债。
