Agricultural Cooperatives Facilitate Agricultural Infrastructure Construction

Increased Grain Production by 40,000 Jin in Two Years

In Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, there is a large river beach to the east, with 102 mu of land on both sides. In the past, because this land was scattered among individual households, it could not be managed uniformly. For example, this land needed irrigation, but there were no canals. Often, after rain, people would watch the floodwaters flow away without being able to do anything about it. Therefore, the yield was only 200-300 jin per mu. Later, mutual aid teams were organized, but the canal problem remained unresolved. It wasn't until the establishment of the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative that, with more manpower, they spent more than 350 workdays in the spring of 1952 to build two large canals, each half a li long. In 1952 and 1953, they took advantage of the floodwaters after rain and mobilized together to irrigate the land. In 1953, this hundred or so mu of land yielded an average of over 569 jin of corn per mu. Counting the increased grain production in 1952, the total increase in grain production over two years was 40,000 jin compared to the yield before irrigation. Seeing the benefits of joining the agricultural production cooperative with their own eyes, another five households in Chuandi Village requested to join the Guo Yu'en Cooperative, and sixty households in Shibutou Village requested the establishment of a branch of the Guo Yu'en Cooperative. (Fei Runsheng, Yang Zhiqin, Jie Hongshou)

Renovated Ninety Mu of Land in One Year

The members of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaijia Village, Yingkou County, Liaodong Province, had over ninety mu of uneven land before the establishment of the cooperative. When irrigating, the low-lying areas would be flooded, damaging the seedlings, while the high-lying areas could not be irrigated, resulting in reduced grain yields year after year. They knew that this was a disadvantage in the past. When farming individually, they always wanted to level the land every year, but they never had the ability to solve this problem. After mutual aid teams were formed, although cooperative labor was better than individual farming, no one was willing to spend so much effort and money to repair the land. Therefore, the problem remained unsolved. In 1953, they established the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative. With unified land use and the need to use new farm tools for cultivation, the entire cooperative organized labor to level these ninety mu of land and covered the nine mu of alkaline land with a layer of black soil more than one inch thick. This greatly facilitated irrigation and improved the soil quality. After the rice seedlings were planted, they grew very uniformly, unlike in previous years when they were uneven in height due to uneven irrigation. These lands yielded one hundred jin more rice per mu than in previous years, ensuring an overall increase in rice production within the cooperative. (Liu Zhenlu)

Alkaline Wasteland Transformed into Fertile Soil

The Song Wendang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiulishuitou Village, Kunlun County, Shandong Province, has a total of 291 mu of cultivated land, of which alkaline land accounts for a quarter. Before the establishment of the cooperative, the seedlings were sparse after sowing in these alkaline lands, and the grain yield was also low. After the cooperative was organized, it put the task of "improving the soil" in the primary position. From the winter of 1952 to the spring of the following year, it spread more than 6,200 carts of sand on sixty mu of spring land and wheat fields. Among them, 1,500 carts were spread on six mu of land in Xiheya, and two drainage ditches, each thirty zhang long, were dug. After initial improvement, not only did the seedlings emerge evenly on these lands, but the crops also grew vigorously. In 1952, cooperative member Song Guangyi's wheat and beans planted on alkaline land in Xiheya yielded less than sixty jin per mu in two seasons; after spreading sand, corn yielded 310 jin per mu, and the average yield of corn on sand-spreading land in the entire cooperative was over 250 jin per mu. Farmers reflected that old alkaline wastelands changed once they were in the hands of the cooperative.

Cooperative members Liu Yunshui and Song Jingji had four mu of low-lying land on the south riverbank of the village. They had planted rice in previous years, but there was never enough water to irrigate during droughts, and water could not be drained during floods, resulting in very low rice yields. They had no choice but to abandon this piece of land. In the spring of 1952, when the cooperative was discussing "developing water conservancy," it decided to work on this piece of land. First, some of the alkaline mud in the field was dug out and flattened, and then two canals were dug to connect to the river. This allowed for timely drainage of accumulated water and also allowed for irrigation with river water. In the autumn, all four mu of rice fields had a bumper harvest. Farmers outside the cooperative all said, "The cooperative has turned Duck Bay into a granary."

After improving the soil, the cooperative also paid attention to technical improvements such as rational fertilization and close planting. Therefore, despite severe waterlogging and insect pests in 1953, there was no reduction in production, and an unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved. (Xu Tianrui, Chu Wenli, Yuan Yunchao)

The Result of Spreading Lake Mud

The land of the Luo Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Fifth District of Yinchuan City, Ningxia Province, is mostly alkaline beach land near the lake, which is low-lying on three sides. For many years, farmers have been troubled by this "bad" land. For the sake of production and livelihood, they had to open up barren land every year to make up for the insufficiency of farmland.

After the organization of the agricultural production cooperative in the spring of 1952, the land and labor were used uniformly, and the cadres mobilized everyone to study soil improvement. Starting in May, all cooperative members carried lake mud to spread on the land. This year, everyone completed the task of spreading lake mud on 25 mu of land, spreading more than 22,000 jin per mu; and drying, crushing, and plowing the lake mud three times, to a depth of more than six inches. When it came time to harvest the rice, an average of 55 bundles were cut per mu (previously, the average was 28 bundles); more than three shi and seven dou were harvested per mu, and the yield was almost doubled compared to the past.

In 1953, they used lake mud to pave another 36 mu of land, averaging 27,000 jin of lake mud per mu; coupled with general improvements in cultivation techniques, many alkaline beaches near the lake were changing day by day. In 1953, the cooperative's rice yielded an average of more than five shi and nine dou per mu. Cooperative Director Luo Zhankui said with confidence: "In a few years, the alkaline land here will become good land, and the low-lying land will become high-lying land!"

Improve Soil and Strive for More Grain

A portion of the cultivated land of the Daijialing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ganyu County, Jiangsu Province, has very poor soil. To improve the soil, it would take more labor. After the autumn harvest, some cooperative members calculated and felt that it was too much effort, so they didn't do it. After the cooperative members studied the general line, everyone's enthusiasm for production increased. Cooperative Director Li Chuanyu guided everyone to talk about the current production issues. He said: "Everyone is very happy to hear that the country is industrialized and that tractors are used to cultivate the land, but how can we take practical actions to strive for this good life? When I was at the county meeting, I chatted with Li Chuansheng (also a director of a production cooperative), and he said that they pressed three thousand jin of sand on one mu of silt soil in their cooperative, increasing grain production by more than one hundred jin. Our cooperative has poor soil quality, so can't we also think of a way? Our increased grain production supports industrial construction, so good days can come quickly!" The director's words reminded everyone at once. After discussion, it was decided to first send a group of people to Dongshaling, more than one li away from the village, to pull yellow sandy soil, put it in the manure pits of each household, accumulate manure, and then take it out in the spring to fertilize the silt soil and improve the soil. Several other cooperative members took three pairs of draught animals to cultivate the land. After these tasks were done, all cooperative members would also carry out the work of exchanging alkaline soil for black soil.

The next day after their discussion, they started working according to the plan. In a few days, the entire cooperative pulled forty-six large carts of sand, totaling more than one hundred thousand jin. The winter cultivation of the fields was also quickly completed once. Then, they began to carry out the work of exchanging alkaline land for black soil.

The Atmosphere of Red Soil Slope Has Changed

The land in Hongtu Slope Village, Yu County, Shanxi Province, is barren. After the Wang Chunlin Agricultural Production Cooperative in the village was organized last year, it had ample manpower to process the land. Last year, they spread soil on 36 mu of red soil and 120 mu of gravelly land, repaired the terraced fields on 35 mu of land, renovated many pieces of inconveniently cultivated land into one large piece, and completely filled in 14 mu of land that had been destroyed by heavy rain more than ten years ago and could not be cultivated. Eleven of the fourteen women in the cooperative who were able to go to the fields to participate in labor went to the fields. They cooperated with the men in dividing the work, and played a significant role in accumulating fertilizer and weeding seedlings. The amount of fertilizer applied by the cooperative last year was twice as much as before the establishment of the cooperative. In the past, seedlings were only weeded twice, but last year they were weeded three or four times. All of this created conditions for increased production in the cooperative. The cooperative's harvest averaged more than 248 jin per mu, which was more than 37 jin more than the local Liu Xiuchuan mutual aid team, and more than 58 jin more than individual farmers. Each cooperative member received more than 1,200 jin of grain, which was 331 jin more than before the establishment of the cooperative. Of the 25 households in Hongtu Slope, 22 joined the cooperative. Most of these households had not escaped poverty until the cooperative was established. After joining the cooperative for one year last year, they not only had enough to eat and wear, but also had some surplus. Nine lazy people were transformed after joining the cooperative. Old man Zhao Huai said: "The cooperative can bring up Hei San (who didn't produce well in the past), the atmosphere of Red Soil Slope has really changed." (Hua Min, Liu Yanhong)

    农业合作社便于进行农业基本建设
    两年增产四万斤粮
    山西平顺县川底村东边有一条大河滩，河滩两旁有一百零二亩土地。过去因为这些土地分散在各家各户，不能统一经营。例如这些土地需要灌溉，但是没有水渠，往往在雨后洪水下来时，大家眼看着这些水白白流走了，也没有办法。所以产量每亩只能打二、三百斤。后来组织了互助组，但是开渠的问题仍没有得到解决。直到成立了郭玉恩农业生产合作社，人力多了，才在一九五二年春天用了三百五十多个工，修好一里半长的两条大渠。一九五二年和一九五三年，他们乘雨后洪水来的时候，就一齐出动，引洪水浇地。一九五三年这一百多亩地，每亩平均产玉米五百六十九斤多。连同一九五二年增产的粮食算起来，两年共比未浇地时的产量增加了四万斤粮食。农民亲眼看到了参加农业生产合作社的好处，川底村又有五户要求入郭玉恩社，石埠头村有六十多户要求设立一个郭玉恩社的分社。　（斐润生　杨志勤　解洪寿）
      一年修整了九十亩地
    辽东省营口县盖家村红光农业生产合作社的社员，在成立社以前，有九十多亩高洼不平的地，浇水时，洼的地方水深伤苗，高的地方却浇不上水，年年少打粮食。他们过去也知道这是一件吃亏的事情。单干时每年都想把地修整平，但总是没有能力解决这个问题；以后有了互助组，虽然互助劳动起来比单干强了，但还是谁家也不肯用那么多工夫和钱来修地，因此，问题还是没有解决。一九五三年他们成立了红光农业生产合作社，土地统一使用了，要使用新农具耕种，全社就组织了劳动力修平这九十亩土地，并把九亩有碱的地垫上了一寸多厚的黑土。这就大大便利了灌溉，也改良了土质。稻秧栽上以后，长得非常齐整，不像往年那样因上水不匀，而一片高一片矮了。这些地一亩比往年多收了一百斤稻子，保证了社内水稻的全面增产。
                                    （刘振禄）
    碱洼地变成沃土
    山东昆仑县九里水头村宋文党农业生产合作社，共有二百九十一亩耕地，其中碱地占四分之一。在成立合作社以前，这些碱地里播种后出苗少，打粮食也少。该社组织起来后就把“改良土壤”的任务，提到首要位置上来，从一九五二年冬天到第二年春天，在六十亩春地和麦地上压了六千二百多车沙。其中西河崖六亩地上就压了一千五百车，并挖了两条共三十丈长的排水渠。经过初步整理，这些地上不但出苗齐，而且庄稼生长很旺盛。社员宋光义一九五二年在西河崖碱地种的小麦和豆子，每亩地两季收入不到六十斤；经过压沙后，玉米每亩产三百一十斤，全社压沙地的玉米每亩平均在二百五十斤以上。农民反映：老碱窝地一到合作社手里就改样了。
    社员刘允水和宋经济在村南河崖上有四亩洼地，头几年曾栽过稻子，总是旱了没水浇，涝了水排不出去，稻子收成很低。他俩没办法，后来干脆就把这块地扔了。一九五二年春天，社内研究“开展水利”时，就决定在这块地上加工。首先把地里的碱泥挖出一些摊平，然后又挖了两条水渠通河。这样既能及时排出积水，还可引河水灌溉。秋天，四亩水稻都丰收了。社外农民都说：“合作社把鸭子湾也变成粮食囤子了。”
    该社在改良土壤后的地上，又注意了合理施肥和密植等技术改进，所以一九五三年虽然有严重的水涝、虫灾，但没有减产，还获得空前丰收。
                  （徐天瑞　初文礼　袁云樵）
      湖泥铺地的结果
    宁夏省银川市五区罗家庄农业生产合作社的土地，大部是三面临湖，地势低洼的碱滩湖边地。过去多少年来，农民一直都为这种“坏”地苦恼着，为了生产和生活，他们只好年年开生荒，来补农田的不足。
    从一九五二年春天组织了农业生产合作社以后，土地和劳力都统一使用了，干部就发动大家研究改良土壤。从五月起，全社社员都背湖泥铺地。这年大家完成了二十五亩地的铺湖泥任务，每亩铺了二万二千多斤；并把湖泥晒干打碎，先后犁了三遍，足有六寸多深。赶到稻子收割的时候，每亩平均割了五十五捆（过去平均割二十八捆）；每亩打到三石七斗多，产量比过去差不多提高一倍。
    一九五三年，他们又用湖泥铺了三十六亩地，每亩平均铺了两万七千斤湖泥；再加上一般耕作技术上的改进，好多湖边碱滩地，已在一天一天改变着。合作社的稻子，一九五三年每亩平均打到五石九斗多。罗占魁社长满有信心地说：“用不了几年工夫，我们这里的碱地都要变成好地了，低田也要变成高田啦！”
    改良土壤，争取多打粮
    江苏赣榆县戴家岭农业生产合作社有一部分耕地，土壤很不好。要改良土壤，就得花上比较多的劳动力。秋后，有些社员合算了一下，觉得太费力就没有去搞。该社社员学习总路线后，大家的生产积极性提高了。社长李传玉就引导大家结合当前的生产问题来谈。他说：“大家听到说国家工业化了，用拖拉机耕地很高兴，但是，我们自己怎样以实际行动争取这种好日子呢？我在县里开会和李传胜（也是生产合作社社长）谈天，他说他们社里一亩淤土压了三千斤沙，增产一百多斤粮食，我们社土质不好，不是也可以想想办法吗？我们增产粮食支援工业建设，好日子才能来得快呀！”社长的话把大家一下提醒了，经过讨论，决定先分一批人到离村一里多路的东沙岭拉黄沙土，分别放在各户的粪坑里，积上粪，春天再取出垩进淤土地，改良土壤。另外几个社员带三犋牲口耕地。把这些工作做好后，全体社员还要搞碱土换黑土的工作。
    他们讨论后第二天就照计划干起来。不几天，全社就拉到四十六大车沙，共有十几万斤。冬耕田也很快地耕完一遍。接着，他们就开始进行碱地换黑土的工作了。
      红土坡的气象变了
    山西盂县红土坡村土地瘠薄。该村王春林农业生产合作社去年组织起来后，就有了充裕的人力对土地加工。他们去年在三十六亩红土发阴的地上和一百二十亩石砾多的圪梁地上垫土，把三十五亩地的梯田修好，把许多块耕作不便的地整修成一大块，还把十多年前大雨冲坏不能耕种的十四亩地完全填平。全社十四个能下地参加劳动的妇女就有十一个下了地，他们和男人分工合作，在积肥、锄苗方面都起了很大作用。社里去年施肥量比往年未成立社时多了一倍，锄苗过去只锄两次，去年锄了三、四次。这都给该社增产创造了条件。社里收成每亩平均二百四十八斤多，比当地刘秀川互助组多三十七斤多，比单干农民多五十八斤多。社员每人分粮一千二百多斤，比未成立社前多了三百三十一斤。红土坡共二十五户人家，参加社的就有二十二户，这些户直到社成立以前，多数都还没有摆脱贫困的境地，去年入社一年，就不但都不缺吃穿，而且还有了些富余。九个懒汉在参加社后被改造了，赵槐老汉说：“合作社能把黑三（过去不好好生产）带起来，红土坡的气象真是变了。”（华民　刘炎红）
