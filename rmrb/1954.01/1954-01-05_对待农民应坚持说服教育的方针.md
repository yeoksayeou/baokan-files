    The work of purchasing grain from farmers has been completed in some areas, and is being actively carried out in most areas. This grain purchasing work is not only a profound education on the general line for rural work cadres and the broad masses of farmers, but also an important step in promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture. We should value and promote the experience gained in this grain purchasing work of carrying out socialist education for farmers, do a good job of the grain purchasing work currently underway, do a good job of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the 1954 agricultural production movement, and push rural work forward. If we promote the policy of persuasion and education when dealing with farmers in this grain purchasing work, and oppose the work style of coercion and commandism, then these tasks can be done very well.
    The state's purchase of grain from farmers is not only to have enough marketable grain to supply the needs of urban and industrial and mining residents, the needs of farmers in economic crop areas, and the needs of farmers who lack food; but also to help farmers get rid of the manipulation and exploitation of unscrupulous merchants and speculators, narrow the connection between farmers and capitalism, raise the socialist awareness of the broad masses of farmers, and gradually guide the scattered small-scale peasant economy to be connected with national planned construction, and lead all farmers onto the bright road of mutual aid and cooperation to develop production. In all places where the grain purchasing work has been done well, farmers feel that their "eyes have been opened," they "feel confident," and "things will be easier to handle in the future," so their enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high, and they are actively participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, preparing to expand agricultural production. This shows that the state's grain purchasing policy is completely in line with the interests of farmers; as long as we do a good job of ideological education and necessary economic work, all farmers will actively support the state's grain purchasing policy. What are the most pressing demands of farmers at present? Countless facts show that the most pressing demands of farmers at present are to continue to develop production, and to gradually improve their living standards on the basis of developing production. If we can meet this demand of farmers, we can win the support of farmers. In the past, farmers, under the leadership of the Party, actively participated in the liberation war against imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and the land reform struggle, ultimately to completely overthrow these enemies and obtain the conditions for developing production and improving their lives. After these three major enemies were overthrown, farmers indeed, under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, rapidly developed production and initially improved their material and cultural lives. However, under the current circumstances, the desire of the broad masses of farmers to further develop production and take the road to common prosperity is still greatly restricted, that is, the dispersal and backwardness of the small-scale peasant economy, which cannot quickly and greatly increase yields; grain merchants and grain speculators are the exploiters of farmers, they buy cheap and sell dear, engage in speculation, disrupt the market, fluctuate prices, and even take advantage of others to lend money on unmatured crops, cruelly exploiting and blackmailing farmers. The state's purchase of grain from farmers can eliminate the exploitation of farmers by these grain merchants and speculators and protect the interests of farmers, which is of great benefit to farmers' development of production. For farmers with surplus grain, the state's purchase of their marketable grain at reasonable prices eliminates the possibility of grain merchants extorting and exploiting them; after they sell their grain and purchase the necessary means of production and means of living, they can concentrate on arranging production and expanding production. For farmers lacking grain, the state's control of sufficient grain makes it possible to ensure that they have grain to eat at reasonable prices; they no longer have to worry about lack of grain, and they can also no longer be exploited by grain merchants and usurers, so they can also concentrate on production.
    In addition to grain merchants and grain speculators, the spontaneous forces of capitalism in rural areas are also unfavorable to the demands of the broad masses of farmers for developing production. Farmers are faced with two roads. One is the capitalist road, that is, a few farmers have surplus money and grain, but instead of legitimately expanding production, they engage in commercial speculation and lend money at usurious rates, as a result, only a few people will become rich and become capitalists in rural areas, and most people will fall into poverty and bankruptcy. This is an extremely painful road for the majority of farmers. The other is the socialist road, that is, developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, guiding farmers to implement collective farming and joint management, no one exploits anyone, no one harms anyone, and the result is that everyone is happy and everyone is prosperous. One of the most important purposes of the state's purchase of grain from farmers is to help farmers block the capitalist road and embark on the socialist road. Isn't this socialist transformation work completely in line with the long-term interests of all farmers?
    Therefore, when purchasing grain from farmers, it must be suitable for the urgent demands of farmers, "enter from production, come out from production," that is, take organizing production as the center, take in-depth publicity of the general line as the driving force, and regard the purchase of grain as the natural result of these two tasks. That is to say, when purchasing grain, we should mobilize farmers to summarize and evaluate production achievements and the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation, and guide farmers to understand from their own experiences the truth that they must respond to the call of the Party and the government and take the socialist road. Carry out in-depth publicity of the general line and the significance of the state's purchase of grain, point out the bright future to farmers, and make them understand that as long as everyone works together, a happy socialist society can arrive early. Help farmers formulate plans to expand production, draw up production plans, and explain that to expand production, two conditions must be prepared: First, prepare the funds for expanding production. Farmers can only obtain sufficient funds by selling grain to the state. The second is to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and transform individual management into collective management. Experience has proved that wherever this method has been used, not only has the task of purchasing grain been completed smoothly, but also the political awareness of farmers has been raised, laying a solid foundation for the further development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. An important aspect of the state's general line for the transition period is to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture; this is the starting point for all rural work. In order to transform the small-scale peasant economy, we must adapt to the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, first of all, adapt to its continuous demand for developing production. Any work that frustrates the production enthusiasm of farmers will arouse the opposition of farmers, and all transformations will be impossible. However, adapting to the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy is to transform the backward aspects of the small-scale peasant economy, and to guide the enthusiasm of farmers' individual economy to the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Otherwise, the so-called "adaptation" will become accommodationism, and the so-called "transformation" will become blind adventurism. All rural work is like this, and grain purchasing work is of course like this. Since the spring of this year, various places have paid attention to leading rural work "starting from the current state of production of the small-scale peasant economy," which is completely correct. However, some people have not fully understood the correct relationship between adapting to the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy and transforming the backwardness of the small-scale peasant economy, only remembering "adaptation" and forgetting "transformation," and regarding the necessary leadership of farmers as undue interference and opposing it, resulting in the weakening of the strength of rural work and the放纵放纵(indulgence) of the development of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas. This lesson should arouse the vigilance of all rural work cadres.
    The experience of grain purchasing work in various places proves that grain purchasing work, like other work, must fully develop the farmer-led, basic aspects, and rely on these dominant, basic aspects to overcome the backwardness of farmers and the blind spontaneous capitalist tendencies. Farmers are laborers, active creators of material and cultural life in the vast rural areas, and in the past, present, and future, they are the most reliable allies of the working class. Not only did the poor peasants obtain many political and material benefits under the leadership of the Communist Party, but the broad masses of middle peasants also obtained these benefits. Therefore, not only can the poor peasants warmly support the state's grain purchasing policy, but also the broad masses of middle peasants can also support the state's grain purchasing policy. As long as we firmly rely on Party members, League members, and activists in rural areas, and consolidate the unity of the broad masses of farmers, we will surely be able to successfully complete the task of purchasing grain.
    At present, it is the middle peasants who own the majority of surplus grain in rural areas, and the middle peasants account for the majority of the rural population, therefore, the key to correctly implementing the grain purchasing policy lies in consolidating the unity of the middle peasants. It must be made clear to the middle peasants: They actively responded to the government's call to develop production, increased grain production through their hard work, and saved grain as funds for expanding production through thrift, and made efforts in restoring and developing the national economy, which is a great contribution to the country. They have saved surplus grain by increasing production and saving, which is very good, and it is glorious to be a "surplus grain household." Some cadres in some areas regard surplus grain households as grain speculators, which is a very wrong view. The vast surplus grain households in rural areas are now actively responding to the call of the Party and the government, and actively selling surplus grain to the state to support the country's economic construction, which is even more glorious and meritorious, and should be welcomed and encouraged by the people. When talking about the capitalist spontaneous forces of farmers, it must also be made clear to farmers: The individual small-scale peasant economy based on private ownership can produce capitalism, but this does not mean that farmers are capitalists, nor does it mean that the small-scale peasant economy is a capitalist economy. When talking about grain speculators in rural areas, we must distinguish between unscrupulous merchants who specialize in grain speculation and farmers who occasionally resell small amounts of grain, distinguish between the speculative hoarding behavior of unscrupulous merchants and the behavior of farmers who store small amounts of grain in order to resist disasters or handle weddings and funerals, and distinguish between farmers who lend grain to help others at general interest rates and usurers, in short, we must distinguish between rural capitalism and spontaneous forces. The so-called spontaneous forces are the blind capitalist tendencies among farmers, which produce capitalism anytime and anywhere, but it is not equal to capitalism itself. The statements such as "having surplus grain at home is a spontaneous force" and "surplus grain households are taking the dead end of capitalism" are completely wrong. For the spontaneous forces of farmers, we can only carry out arduous persuasion and education, and coordinate with various necessary economic work, appropriately limit and transform them, and at the same time adopt active and steady methods to guide this enthusiasm to the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Only by clearly drawing the above-mentioned policy boundaries can we unite the broad masses of farmers and concentrate our forces to isolate the very few grain merchants and speculators who resist government decrees and disrupt grain purchasing work.
    That is to say, exaggerating the backward aspects of farmers and ignoring the farmer-led, basic aspects, thus emphasizing difficulties and lacking confidence in grain purchasing work is completely wrong and has no basis. But believing that grain purchasing work can be easily completed, thus being blindly optimistic and not carrying out arduous persuasion and education for farmers is also wrong, which may lead to errors of coercion and commandism and rash advance. Grain purchasing work is completely in line with the long-term and realistic interests of farmers, and only does not fit the interests of the spontaneous tendencies of farmers. But the road of this spontaneous trend is a road familiar to farmers. Farmers are not only laborers, but also small private owners and small commodity producers. For thousands of years, the life of farmers has been painful, and the individual economy of farmers has been fragile, but when they have the opportunity, they are accustomed to adopting exploitative methods to seek personal wealth. To save farmers from this road, it is clear that arduous persuasion and education work must be carried out. Farmers can accept socialism, but farmers can only accept socialism based on their own experiences. We can only use the new experience of farmers walking the road of mutual aid and cooperation and everyone becoming rich under the leadership of the Communist Party to defeat the old experience of farmers walking the capitalist road based on the requirements of spontaneous tendencies. And this must absolutely not be rushed. Lenin said, "It is completely absurd to think that it is possible to use some rapid method, some command to force a transformation from the outside, from the side. We clearly understand that to influence millions of small-scale peasant economies, we can only adopt gradual and cautious methods, and only use practical exemplary examples to show." ("Speech at the First Congress of Agricultural Communes and Agricultural Labor Combinations") Lenin's instructions are completely applicable to the grain purchasing work we are currently carrying out and other work to transform the small-scale peasant economy in rural areas in the future. Some people do not understand the truth that "the serious problem is to educate farmers," do not understand the arduousness of transforming the small-scale peasant economy, and think that things that they understand are also understood by farmers, and that things that they want farmers to do should be done immediately, so they abandon the policy of persuasion and education, adopt administrative command methods, and delusionally want to "go smoothly" and "succeed immediately," resulting in turning good things into bad things. Like the grain purchasing work currently underway, which is originally a good thing for the country and the people, but some people adopted wrong coercive methods when doing this good thing, resulting in arousing the resentment of farmers and causing adverse effects on future rural work. This problem must be quickly corrected.
    Now, the leading organs in many regions have dispatched special inspection teams to go deep into rural areas to inspect the publicity work of the general line and the grain purchasing work, sum up experience, correct shortcomings, and promote this work to develop along a normal and healthy road, which is very necessary. All regions that have completed the grain purchasing work should immediately guide the socialist consciousness and enthusiasm for developing production that farmers have developed in the process of selling grain to the development of mutual aid and cooperation and winter production work. It is necessary to help farmers rationally arrange and use the funds obtained from selling grain, help farmers formulate production plans, and especially help farmers consolidate and develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Regions where grain purchasing work is underway should make every effort to do a good job of ideological education, correctly implement the state's grain purchasing policy, and strive to achieve the three-in-one goal of purchasing the grain needed by the state, raising the awareness of farmers, and promoting agricultural production. In areas where deviations have occurred, we must resolutely carry out "make-up lessons," first of all, make up for the lack of ideological education, re-mobilize the masses, so as to bring the movement back to the normal track.

    对待农民应坚持说服教育的方针
    向农民收购粮食的工作，一部分地区已经完成了，大部分地区正在积极进行中。这次购粮工作，不仅对农村工作干部和广大农民群众是一次关于总路线的深刻的教育，而且对推动农业的社会主义改造是一个重要步骤。我们应该重视和发扬这次购粮工作中所创造的对农民进行社会主义教育的经验，把正在进行的购粮工作认真作好，把互助合作运动和一九五四年的农业生产运动作好，把农村工作向前推进一步。我们发扬这次购粮工作中对待农民坚持说服教育的方针，反对强迫命令的作风，那么，这些工作都是能够作得很好的。
    国家向农民收购粮食，不仅是为了掌握足够的商品粮，以便供应城市和工矿区居民的需要，供应经济作物区的农民和缺乏口粮的农民的需要；而且是为了帮助农民摆脱奸商、投机者的操纵和剥削，缩小农民与资本主义的联系，提高广大农民的社会主义的觉悟，把分散的小农经济逐步引上与国家计划建设相联系，把全体农民引到互助合作发展生产的光明大道上来。凡是购粮工作做得好的地方，农民都觉得“眼睛亮了”，“心里有底了”，“以后的事情更好办了”，因而生产积极性空前高涨，纷纷参加互助合作运动，准备扩大农业生产。这就说明，国家的购粮政策是完全适合农民的利益的；我们只要作好了思想教育工作和必要的经济工作，全体农民都会积极拥护国家的购粮政策。当前农民最迫切的要求是什么呢？无数事实证明，当前农民最迫切的要求是继续发展生产，并在发展生产的基础上逐步提高生活水平。我们只要能满足农民这个要求，就能得到农民的拥护。过去农民所以在党的领导下，积极参加了反对帝国主义和国民党反动统治的解放战争和土地改革的斗争，归根到底，都是为了彻底推翻这些敌人，取得发展生产和改善生活的条件。这三大敌人被推翻以后，农民果然在党和政府的领导与支援下，迅速发展了生产，初步改善了物质生活和文化生活。但在目前情况下，广大农民进一步发展生产和走共同富裕道路的要求还受着很大的限制，这就是小农经济的分散和落后，不能很快地很大地提高产量；粮食奸商和粮食投机分子是农民的剥削者，他们贱买贵卖、投机倒把、扰乱市场、波动物价，甚至乘人之危放青苗债，残酷地剥削和敲诈农民。国家向农民收购粮食，就能取缔这些粮食奸商和投机分子对农民的剥削，保护农民的利益，这对农民发展生产是有极大好处的。对于余粮户来说，国家用合理的价格收购他们的商品粮食，这就免除了粮食奸商讹诈和剥削他们的可能；他们卖出粮食，购进必要的生产资料和生活资料，就能一心一意地安排生产和扩大生产了。对于缺粮户来说，国家掌握了足够的粮食，就可能用合理的价格，保证他们有粮食吃；他们既不必再为缺粮而发愁，也可以不再受粮食奸商和高利贷者的剥削，这样，他们也就能安心生产了。
    除了粮食奸商和粮食投机分子以外，农村的资本主义自发势力对于广大农民发展生产的要求也是不利的。农民面前摆着两条道路。一条是资本主义道路，即少数农民有了余钱余米，不去正当地扩大生产，而去进行商业投机，放高利贷，结果，只会有少数人发财致富，变成农村的资本家，多数人就会陷于贫困和破产。这对多数农民说来是一条极为痛苦的道路。另有一条社会主义的道路，即发展互助合作运动，引导农民实行集体耕作和共同经营，谁也不剥削谁，谁也不坑害谁，其结果是大家幸福，人人富裕。国家向农民收购粮食的一个极为重要的目的，就是帮助农民堵死资本主义的道路，走上社会主义的道路。这种社会主义改造的工作，完全适合全体农民的长远利益，这不是最清楚不过的么？
    因此，向农民收购粮食的时候，必须适合农民的迫切要求，“由生产进，从生产出”，即以组织生产为中心，以深入宣传总路线为动力，而把收购粮食作为这两件工作的自然的结果。这就是说，在收购粮食的时候，应该发动农民总结和评比生产成绩与互助合作的好处，引导农民从切身经验中认识必须响应党和政府的号召走社会主义道路的道理。深入宣传总路线和国家收购粮食的意义，给农民指出光明的前途，使他们懂得，只要大家共同努力，幸福的社会主义就能提早到来。帮助农民制订扩大生产的计划，打生产谱，说明要扩大生产，必须准备两个条件：一是准备扩大生产的资金，农民只有把粮食卖给国家，才能筹得足够的资金。一是参加互助合作运动，把个体经营变成集体经营。经验证明，凡是运用了这种方法的地方，不仅顺利地完成了购粮的任务，而且提高了农民的政治觉悟，为进一步发展互助合作的运动打下坚实的基础。国家过渡时期总路线的一个重要方面，就是逐步实现对农业的社会主义的改造；这是一切农村工作的出发点。为了改造小农经济，必须适应小农经济的特点，首先是适应它的不断要求发展生产的特点。任何工作，如果挫折了农民的生产积极性，就要引起农民的反对，一切改造都将无从说起。但适应小农经济的特点，是为了改造小农经济的落后的方面，是为了把农民个体经济的积极性，引导到互助合作的道路上来。否则，所谓“适应”就要变成迁就主义，所谓“改造”就要变成盲目冒进了。一切农村工作都是这样，购粮工作当然也是这样。今年春季以来，各地注意了“从小农经济的生产现状”出发来领导农村工作，这是完全正确的。但有些人没有完全懂得适应小农经济的特点和改造小农经济的落后性的正确关系，只记住“适应”，忘掉了“改造”，把对农民的必要的领导也当成不应有的干涉而加以反对，结果就减弱了农村工作的力量，放纵了农村资本主义自发势力的发展。这个教训应该引起所有农村工作干部的警惕。
    各地购粮工作的经验证明，购粮工作和其他工作一样，必须充分发扬农民主导的、基本的方面，依靠这些主导的、基本的方面，克服农民的落后性和盲目的资本主义自发趋势。农民是劳动者，是广大农村中物质和文化生活的积极创造者，在过去、现在和将来，都是工人阶级最可靠的同盟军。不仅贫农在共产党领导下获得了许多政治的、物质的利益，广大中农同样获得了这些利益。因此，不仅贫农能够热烈拥护国家的购粮政策，广大中农同样能够拥护国家的购粮政策。我们只要坚决地依靠农村中的党团员和积极分子，巩固地团结广大的农民群众，必然能够圆满地完成收购粮食的任务。
    现在农村中拥有多数余粮的是中农，中农又占农村人口的大多数，因此，正确执行购粮政策的关键在于巩固地团结中农。必须向中农说明白：他们积极响应政府发展生产的号召，用自己辛勤的劳动增产了粮食，用节约的办法余下粮食来作为扩大生产的资金，在恢复和发展国民经济中尽了力量，这对国家是有很大的功劳的。他们用增产节约的方法存下了余粮，这是很好的，当这种“余粮户”是光荣的。某些地区的某些干部把余粮户都当成粮食投机分子，这种看法是十分错误的。农村里广大的余粮户，现在又积极地响应党和政府的号召，积极把余粮卖给国家，支援国家的经济建设，这是更加光荣，更有功劳的事情，应该受到人民的欢迎和鼓励。当说到农民的资本主义自发势力时，又必须向农民说清楚：建立在私有制基础上的个体小农经济，是可以产生资本主义的，但这并不是说农民就是资本家，也不是说小农经济就是资本主义经济。当说到农村中的粮食投机分子时，必须把专门从事粮食投机的奸商与偶然倒卖过少量粮食的农民区别开来，把奸商的投机囤积的行为和农民为了抵御灾荒或办理婚丧等事而储存少量粮食的行为区别开来，把以一般利息出借粮食帮助别人的农户与高利贷者区别开来，总之，要把农村的资本主义和自发势力区别开来。所谓自发势力，就是农民中的盲目的资本主义倾向，它随时随地产生着资本主义，但它本身并不等于资本主义。那种“家有余粮就是自发势力”、“余粮户就是走资本主义死路”等说法是完全错误的。对于农民的自发势力，只能进行艰苦的说服教育，并配合各种必要的经济工作，适当地加以限制和改造，同时采取积极稳步的方法，把这种积极性引导到互助合作的道路上去。只有划清了上述的政策界线，才能团结广大农民，集中力量孤立极少数抗拒政府法令、破坏购粮工作的粮食奸商和投机分子。
    这就是说，夸大农民落后的方面，忽视农民主导的、基本的方面，因而强调困难，对购粮工作没有信心，是完全不对的，没有根据的。但认为购粮工作能够轻易完成，因此盲目乐观，不对农民进行艰苦的说服教育，同样是不对的，这就可能造成强迫命令、急躁冒进的错误。购粮工作完全适合农民的长远利益和现实利益，仅仅不适合农民的自发趋势的利益。但这条自发趋势的道路却是农民所熟悉的道路。农民不只是劳动者，还是小私有者和小商品生产者。几千年来，农民的生活是痛苦的，农民的个体经济是脆弱的，但遇有机会，他们却又习惯于采取剥削的方法，求得个人发财致富。要把农民从这条路上挽救过来，显然必须进行艰苦的说服教育工作。农民能够接受社会主义，但农民只能根据他们的切身经验接受社会主义。我们只能用农民在共产党领导下走互助合作道路大家富裕的新经验，去战胜农民根据自发趋势的要求走资本主义道路的老经验。而这是绝对急躁不得的。列宁说过，“要想用某种急速办法，某种命令来从外面、从旁边去强迫加以改造，那都是完全荒谬的思想。我们明白懂得，要想影响千百万小农经济，只能采取逐渐的谨慎的办法，只能用实际模范例子来表明”。（“在农业公社和农业劳动组合第一次代表大会上的演说”）列宁的指示，对于我们目前进行的购粮工作和今后在农村中所进行的改造小农经济的其他工作，都是完全适用的。有些人不懂得“严重的问题是教育农民”的道理，不懂得改造小农经济的艰巨性，以为自己明白了的事情农民也都已经明白了，自己想要农民作的事情农民就该马上做到，于是放弃说服教育的方针，采取行政命令的方法，妄想“一帆风顺”，“马到成功”，结果就把好事办成了坏事。像目前进行的购粮工作，本来是福国利民的好事，但有些人在作这件好事的时候采取了错误的强迫命令的方法，结果引起了农民的反感，并给以后的农村工作造成不良的影响。这种毛病必须迅速加以纠正。
    现在许多地区的领导机关派出了专门的检查组，深入农村检查总路线的宣传工作和购粮工作，总结经验，纠正缺点，推动这一工作沿着正常的健康的道路发展，这是十分必要的。一切完成购粮工作的地区，应当把农民在售粮过程中生长起来的社会主义觉悟和发展生产的热情，立刻引导到发展互助合作和冬季生产工作中去。要帮助农民合理地安排和使用售粮所得的资金，帮助农民订好生产计划，特别要帮助农民巩固和发展互助合作组织。正在进行购粮工作的地区，应该全力作好思想教育工作，正确执行国家的购粮政策，力争实现购到国家所需要的粮食、提高农民的觉悟而又推动了农业生产的三位一体的目的。在发生了偏向的地区，要坚决进行“补课”，首先是补思想教育不足的课，重新发动群众，以便把运动引到正常的轨道上来。
