Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The second session of the 83rd United States Congress will discuss the US government's economic policies. For this reason, American newspapers are increasingly talking about the threat of economic crisis in the United States, and the signs of this crisis have become increasingly apparent recently.

    "New York Times" commentator Phillips wrote: Congress is convening in a situation where the national economy is encountering the most severe "natural adjustment" since 1949, and its impact will be even more severe in the coming months.

    Recently, American newspapers have continuously published statements about the intensification of the economic crisis in the United States. Many newspapers are particularly concerned about the decline in American business activity, such as increased inventories, reduced production in heavy industry sectors, and increased unemployment. According to official materials, in December 1953 alone, the number of unemployed people in the United States increased by 422,000. The newspapers pointed out that the current hype about the "prosperity" of the American economy by certain figures in the American ruling group is an attempt to conceal the fact of the decline of the American economy.

    美国经济危机迹象越来越明显
    美国资产阶级报刊十分忧虑
    据新华社讯：美国八十三届国会第二期会议将讨论美国政府的经济政策。为此，美国报纸越来越多地谈论美国经济危机的威胁，这种危机的迹象最近是表现得越来越明显了。
    “纽约时报”评论员菲利普斯写道：国会是在这种情况下开会的：国民经济正遭遇着一九四九年以来最厉害的一次“自然调整”，它的影响在今后几个月内将更为厉害。
    近来，美国报纸不断刊载关于美国经济危机现象加剧的言论。许多报纸特别忧虑的是美国企业活动的衰落，例如存货增加，重工业部门生产减少以及失业人数增加等等。根据官方材料，仅在一九五三年十二月一个月，美国失业人数就增加了四十二万两千人。各报指出，美国统治集团某些人士目前大吹大擂地预言美国经济的“繁荣”，是企图掩饰美国经济衰落的事实。
