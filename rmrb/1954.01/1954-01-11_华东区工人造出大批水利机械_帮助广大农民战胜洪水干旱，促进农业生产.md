[Report from Our Newspaper] Workers in Shanghai and other heavy industrial factories in East China have manufactured large quantities of machinery and equipment for water conservancy construction over the past few years, supplying the needs of the Huai River project and other large-scale water conservancy projects. Much of the machinery and equipment used in the six large valley reservoir projects, such as the famous Fotziling, Nanwan, and Boshan, and more than fifty culvert projects, such as the Sanhe Sluice and Runheji, as well as the Guanting Reservoir in Hebei Province, currently the largest in China, were manufactured by heavy industrial factories in the East China region. In 1953 alone, East China's heavy industrial factories supplied more than 300 sets of hoists (control equipment for opening and closing gates), 124 gates, and other water conservancy construction machinery. The heavy industrial factories also sent more than 700 workers to the construction sites to be responsible for installation.

　　The Fotziling Reservoir is the largest reservoir in the Huai River project. It has a flood storage capacity of more than 470 million cubic meters. The flood is contained by a reinforced concrete arch dam. Most of its mechanical equipment, such as hoists and high-pressure gates, are manufactured by heavy industrial factories in Shanghai. In addition, Shanghai's heavy industrial factories have supplied various modern tools and machinery needed for the construction of this project, which have played a significant role in ensuring the quality of the project. In order to help the Fotziling Reservoir project to be completed ahead of schedule, workers in Shanghai's heavy industrial factories are rushing to manufacture many new machines. Among them, a cement pump for automatically conveying cement is being manufactured by the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory. Workers at the Xinzhong Power Machine Factory are manufacturing cylindrical bearings for the Fotziling Reservoir's hollow column gate, which can withstand a horizontal thrust of 60 tons, exceeding the efficiency of ordinary bearings by one time.

　　The Sanhe Sluice, a hub for flood discharge, irrigation, and navigation in the lower reaches of the Huai River, has sixty-three openings. All sixty-three steel gates, with a total weight of more than 900 tons, were manufactured and installed by workers at the Shanghai Huadong Construction Steel Factory. In order to complete the installation of this project before the flood season, the workers demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm, and work efficiency was continuously improved: the daily rate of gate installation increased from five to twelve, and the number of rivets per rivet gun increased from 400 to more than 900 per day, and the installation of supports increased from two and a half openings to three openings per day. Thanks to the workers' selfless labor, the project was completed ten days ahead of schedule.

　　In addition, various types of machinery needed for the nation's largest Guanting Reservoir project in Hebei Province are also manufactured by workers in East China's heavy industry. Huge high-pressure gates, hoists, steel linings, and trash racks have been successively transported to the construction site. These machines were rushed out by workers at the Jin Gang Boiler Factory and other factories during the hot summer last year. Now, workers are braving sub-zero temperatures to carry out installation work at the construction site.

　　Workers in Shanghai and other parts of East China have used advanced technology to manufacture and supply large quantities of machinery and equipment for water conservancy projects, enabling the vast number of farmers not only to reduce the threat of floods but also to utilize rivers to obtain irrigation convenience. This fully demonstrates the tremendous support of heavy industrial production for agriculture.

　　[Report from Our Newspaper] Workers at the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard completed a "suction-lifting" dredger on December 30, 1953, to support the Huai River project, which will soon be transported to the Huai River construction site. All the mechanical equipment of this ship was manufactured by the workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard themselves, and they also received assistance from Soviet water conservancy expert Comrade Bukov in the design.

　　In order to send the dredger to the Huai River construction site as soon as possible, the shipyard workers worked day and night. The daily work efficiency of each group of riveters increased from 480 to 716 rivets; the Huang Jingen group, which was responsible for assembling the hull, completed the task twelve days ahead of schedule for two consecutive months and saved 99 man-days.

　　This "suction-lifting" dredger is 30.5 meters long and 9 meters wide. Its efficiency: it can directly transport 100 to 150 cubic meters of silt from the center of the river to the shore 800 to 1,000 meters away through a mud discharge pipe per hour (generally, the work of dredging and transporting mud is done separately by ordinary dredgers, and after the mud is dug out, it must be transported by other ships). This spring, this "suction-lifting" dredger will begin working on the Huai River project.

    华东区工人造出大批水利机械
    帮助广大农民战胜洪水干旱，促进农业生产
    【本报讯】上海和华东各地的重工业工厂职工，几年来制造了大批为水利建设用的机械和器材，供应了治淮工程和其他大型水利工程的需要。著名的佛子岭、南湾、薄山等六个大型山谷水库工程，和三河闸、润河集等五十多座涵闸工程，以及我国目前容量最大的河北省官厅水库等工程所用的机械和器材，许多都是华东地区各重工业工厂承制的。仅一九五三年，华东各重工业工厂所供应的水利建设机械即有：启闭机（开关闸门的控制设备）三百余部，闸门一百二十四扇等。各重工业工厂还派出了七百多名工人前往工地，负责安装。
    佛子岭水库是治淮工程中最大的水库。它的蓄洪量有四亿七千余万立方公尺。拦蓄洪水的是一座钢筋混凝土连拱坝。它的大部分机械设备如启闭机和高压闸门等，都是由上海重工业工厂制造的。此外，上海各重工业工厂并供应了修建这一工程所需的各种近代化工具、机械，对保证工程质量起了很大作用。为了帮助佛子岭水库工程提前完工，上海各重工业工厂的工人正在赶制许多新的机械。其中用以自动接送水泥的水泥帮浦，正由上海矿山机器厂制造中。新中动力机厂的工人正在制造佛子岭水库空柱闸门用的圆筒形轴承，这种轴承可承受六十吨的水平推力，超出一般轴承的效能一倍。
    淮河下游排洪、灌溉、航运的枢纽——三河闸共有六十三孔，总重量达九百多吨的六十三扇钢铁闸门，全部是由上海华东建筑钢铁厂的工人制造和安装的。为了把这个工程在洪水期以前安装完工，工人们发挥了高度的积极性，工作效率不断提高：安装闸门每天从装好五块提高到装好十二块，每支铆钉枪由一天铆四百只铆钉提高到九百多只，安装支架由每天二孔半提高到三孔。在工人们忘我的劳动下，使工程提前十天完成。
    另外，全国最大的河北省官厅水库工程所需要的各种机械，也是由华东重工业工人制造的。巨大的高压闸门、启闭机和钢衬砌、拦污栅等均已陆续运往工地。这些机械是金刚锅炉厂等工厂的工人在去年炎热的夏天里赶制出来的，现在工人们又在冒着零下的严寒，在工地上进行着安装工作。
    上海和华东各地的工人，用先进的技术制造并供应了大批水利工程用的机械和器材，使广大农民不仅可以减轻洪水的威胁，而且可以利用河流获得灌溉的便利。这充分表明了重工业生产对农业的巨大支援。
    【本报讯】上海江南造船所工人为支援治淮工程，在一九五三年十二月三十日，完成了一艘“吸扬式”挖泥机船，不久即可运到淮河工地。这艘船的全部机械设备都是江南造船所工人亲手制造，在设计中还得到苏联水利专家布可夫同志的帮助。
    造船所的工人们为了早日把挖泥机船送到淮河工地，不分日夜地进行工作。铆钉工人每组每天的工作效率，由四百八十只提高到七百十六只；担任装配船体任务的黄金根小组，接连两个月提前十二天完成了任务，并节省人力九十九个。
    这艘“吸扬式”挖泥机船，全长三十点五公尺，宽九公尺。它的效能：每小时可由河心把一百至一百五十立方公尺的淤泥，通过输泥管直接运送到八百至一千公尺远的岸上去（一般挖泥船挖泥和输送泥土的工作分开做，挖出泥后，要用其他船运送）。今年春季，这艘“吸扬式”挖泥机船就将在治淮工程中开始工作。
