Our country is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The victory of our country's new democratic revolution and the completion of the national economic recovery were achieved by relying on the close alliance of workers and peasants. The realization of the general line of the state's transition period depends even more on giving play to the leading role of the working class and strengthening the close unity of workers and peasants; the worker-peasant alliance is not only the foundation of our country's people's democratic dictatorship, but also the basic force for building socialism and completing socialist transformation. Therefore, making every effort to continue to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance is a long-term and important task for the people of the whole country.

All the policies and guidelines of our Party and government are formulated with the aim of strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. Over the past few years, the Party and the government have taken all measures to continuously develop industrial and agricultural production, gradually reduce the prices of industrial products, carry out material exchange work, and transport industrial products to the countryside to meet the growing needs of farmers; at the same time, they have called on and organized farmers to sell grain and cash crops to the state to support industry and meet the needs of workers; the lives of workers and peasants have been improved year by year, and as a result, the material foundation of the worker-peasant alliance has become stronger day by day.

The daily contact between workers and peasants is also strengthening day by day with the elimination of the opposition between urban and rural areas. Since liberation, Party committees and governments in various regions have organized various activities conducive to strengthening the understanding and connection between workers and peasants. For example: mobilizing workers to go to the countryside to visit farmers, and using machinery and technology to help farmers when they suffer from floods and droughts; organizing farmers to visit factories; holding get-togethers and forums for workers and farmers, etc. Since vigorously publicizing the general line of the state's transition period to workers and peasants, many well-known industrial labor models and agricultural labor models, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and mutual aid teams across the country have been corresponding with each other, reporting their production achievements, expressing their determination to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, and encouraging each other to achieve greater achievements on the production front. The connection between workers and peasants, under the encouragement of the general line, is closer than ever before.

With the increasing development of industrial and agricultural production, some new situations and new problems have emerged. For example, in order to develop production and improve their lives, farmers are demanding that workers supply more and better industrial products; workers, in order to continue to develop industry, are demanding that farmers supply more grain, non-staple foods, and industrial raw material crops. At the same time, as the connection between workers and peasants becomes closer and the contact between workers and peasants becomes more frequent, things that were irrelevant to them in the past are now relevant, and misunderstandings that were not easy to occur in the past are now occurring. If these new problems are not handled properly, some abnormal phenomena can easily occur in worker-peasant relations. In fact, in some individual places, some individual workers only see the backwardness of farmers, think that farmers are selfish and conservative, and therefore look down on them, put on airs, show off, are proud and arrogant, and domineering; a few workers, instead of depositing their surplus money in the state bank to help national construction and reasonably arrange their lives, squander and waste it, eat and drink extravagantly, and even hoard grain, buy land, lend money, engage in speculative business, and open shops to be small bosses, which has aroused resentment and dissatisfaction among farmers. On the other hand, some farmers, because they do not understand what industry is, and what the work and lives of workers are like, mistakenly believe that workers' jobs are very easy, their wages are too high, and their lives are too good.

The reasons for the formation of this phenomenon, in addition to the fact that some workers and peasants do have some shortcomings and weaknesses, are mainly because we have not done enough to educate and publicize the worker-peasant alliance to workers and peasants in rural areas and factories and mines in the past, so that some workers and peasants often only see each other's shortcomings and ignore the other's basic and major aspects. We must change this situation and take the publicity of the worker-peasant alliance as an extremely important task and as an important part of the long-term publicity of the general line of the transition period to the people. This kind of publicity and education work should be carried out at any time, and it should be carried out on a large scale and in a concentrated manner during this year's Spring Festival. Because during the Spring Festival, many workers, especially construction workers, will return to their hometowns for vacation; many farmers will go to cities and factories to visit their children. The Spring Festival is the most common and frequent time for direct contact between workers and peasants throughout the year. It is obviously very necessary and possible to use this opportunity to educate workers and peasants about the worker-peasant alliance in the form of mutual visits and get-togethers between workers and peasants, and to create an atmosphere of mutual trust, mutual support, and mutual love between workers and peasants.

The purpose of carrying out this publicity and education is to make all workers and peasants understand the principle that workers and peasants, industry and agriculture, and urban and rural areas must support each other, understand that the general line of the state's transition period is completely in line with the interests of workers and peasants, understand that the interests of workers and peasants are completely consistent, make farmers understand that they must rely on the leadership of the working class, and make workers understand that they must play an exemplary role in national construction and daily actions.

We must explain clearly to the farmers: the working class is the most revolutionary class, and workers work all year round, and their labor is very intense. The value of labor produced by workers is many times greater than that of farmers, and the income (wages) of workers seems to be more than that of farmers, but the wages received by workers are only a very small part of the value they create, unlike farmers who, in addition to paying a certain amount of agricultural tax, all income belongs to themselves. Moreover, the cost of living in cities is higher, and food, clothing, housing, and transportation all require money. Individual workers do not have means of production and no sideline income, and all living expenses depend on wages. Therefore, the lives of workers, especially those with many children, are actually not well-off, and many people are still relatively poor. We must also explain clearly to the farmers: in recent years, due to the rapid development of our country's economic construction, a large number of small producers and members of other classes have poured into the ranks of the working class. These people inevitably bring the ideological consciousness and bad habits of the original class; our country's working class has lived in the encirclement of small private owners for a long time, and has frequent multi-faceted contact with the bourgeoisie, which is bound to be affected and eroded by their bad ideas and habits; this is the root cause of some shortcomings in the life and style of a few workers. It should be pointed out that bad elements who deliberately undermine worker-peasant relations will inevitably be subject to the due punishment of the people's government, and these shortcomings existing in a few workers can be quickly corrected under the education of the Party and the trade union and with the help of the people of the whole country. We must also explain to the broad masses of farmers: many farmers have a traditional prejudice against "city people," which should be changed now. Before liberation, imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government, and the landlord class all used cities as their bases to cruelly oppress and exploit farmers; there was a ditch between cities and villages, which caused farmers to have a general dislike and dissatisfaction with "city people." In fact, the working class suffered even more severe oppression and exploitation than farmers in those dark years. In order to get rid of this oppression and exploitation, the working class carried out a long and arduous revolutionary struggle in the cities, and its vanguard—the Communist Party—sent its members and workers to the vast rural areas to lead farmers in an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, which resulted in the complete defeat of the people's enemies and the victory of the new democratic revolution. However, after the victory of the revolution, and after the people's government led by the working class managed the cities, the relationship between urban and rural areas has undergone fundamental changes. The current cities are no longer bases for oppressing the countryside, but bases for the working class to assist farmers from production and culture, and fortresses for leading the countryside to continuously move forward. We must explain clearly to the farmers: the state led by the working class requires farmers to supply grain and raw materials to workers, and requires the adjustment of some land to build factories and railways, not for the private interests of workers, but for building socialism in our country and for the happiness of workers, peasants, and the people of the whole country. Therefore, farmers' support for industrial construction is by no means a "loss." Farmers should no longer discriminate against "city people," but should support the cities and help the cities.

When conducting propaganda on the worker-peasant alliance, we must also explain clearly to the worker masses: farmers are the most reliable allies of the working class, and farmers have exerted great efforts and made great contributions in the past democratic revolution stage and the national economic recovery process; farmers are fully capable of entering socialism under the leadership of the working class; the working class must have the support of farmers in order to build our country into a strong and happy socialist country. In order to realize the country's socialist industrialization, it is necessary to correspondingly develop agriculture, and it is necessary to actively assist farmers with our existing industrial strength. Without the development of agriculture and without sufficient grain and cash crops, the country's socialist industrialization is impossible to achieve. The current countryside is actively supporting the city, and the countryside is willing to support the city because the city can lead the countryside. Therefore, the city, with the working class as the main body, must first actively help the countryside in order to obtain the countryside's help to the city. We must also explain to the workers: farmers have the shortcomings of being conservative, selfish, and backward, but farmers also have the main aspect, that is, the revolutionary aspect that can follow the working class into socialism. And these shortcomings of farmers are also the result of the instability of the small-scale peasant economy and the long-term oppression and exploitation that have led to extreme poverty, and the result of our insufficient and insufficiently widespread political education of farmers. Many workers were farmers not long ago, and they should be very clear about this situation. We should be concerned about the hardships of farmers' lives, help farmers overcome these shortcomings, and lead farmers onto the road of mutual aid and cooperation. But in order to help farmers overcome their shortcomings, the worker masses must first overcome their own shortcomings, highly promote their exemplary role and leadership responsibility, otherwise, the so-called helping farmers will become empty talk.

In order to ensure that this publicity work can effectively achieve results, it is also necessary to carry out many necessary preparatory work among workers and farmers separately. For workers who are preparing to return to their hometowns for vacation, they are required to actively publicize the general line and the worker-peasant alliance to farmers after understanding the above-mentioned principles, help farmers understand the situation of industrial construction; express gratitude for farmers' efforts to produce grain and industrial raw materials to support industrial construction; and in conjunction with various rural work tasks, encourage their family members and relatives to take the lead in responding to the call of the Party and the government, settle down to work in the countryside, develop agricultural production, enthusiastically sell surplus grain to the state, actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, strive to prepare for increased agricultural production, enthusiastically purchase national construction bonds, and actively participate in grass-roots elections. Returning workers should also show farmers the organization and discipline of the working class in their daily actions and set a good example for farmers. It is best to inspire returning workers to formulate return-to-hometown disciplines after discussion, such as not insulting farmers, not arguing with farmers, not engaging in gambling and superstitious activities, not eating and drinking extravagantly, not buying land, not lending money, not hoarding grain, not engaging in speculative business, and strictly abiding by government laws and rural order, etc. The Party organizations and trade unions of each factory and mine should take appropriate methods to organize get-togethers between the employees staying in the factory and nearby farmers, or invite rural cadres and farmers to visit the factory, or organize workers to visit farmers, in order to strengthen the understanding between workers and peasants. The Party organizations of each factory and mine should also conduct necessary political work within a certain range among the farmers near the factory and mine, promptly educate and correct the behavior of destroying worker-peasant unity among the employees, and cooperate with the local rural Party organizations and the government to quickly resolve certain misunderstandings and disputes that occur between workers and peasants. During the Spring Festival, the Party committees of each factory and mine should check their relationship with nearby farmers once, and seriously and properly handle the events that affected worker-peasant relations in the past but have not yet been handled. When handling such events, it is best to invite relevant worker and peasant representatives to participate and directly educate them. In addition to educating farmers on the worker-peasant alliance, the Party organizations in various rural areas should organize rural work cadres and farmers to express condolences to workers in places where there are workers returning home for vacation; if conditions permit, they can organize farmers to visit nearby factories; in addition, they can also mobilize farmers and workers to have get-togethers, and mobilize farmers to write letters to workers, in order to deepen the mutual understanding between workers and peasants and encourage the enthusiasm of the masses of farmers to develop production and mutual aid and cooperation.

Get-togethers are an extremely effective form of exchanging emotions and establishing close ties. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, the liberated areas often organized army-civilian get-togethers during the Spring Festival and other appropriate occasions. The army and civilians reported on the war and production, made demands on each other, encouraged each other, and conducted appropriate self-criticism, which played a great role in the army's support for the government and love for the people and the farmers' support for the army and preferential treatment for families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. Absorbing and carrying forward the past experience, it is completely necessary and appropriate to appropriately organize workers and peasants to have get-togethers in all factories, mines, and rural areas with conditions during this year's Spring Festival. This kind of get-together should be simple and convenient, the time should not be too long, and it should be completely suitable for the customs of the local people. During the get-together, both workers and peasants should appropriately review their own shortcomings, put forward the direction of their efforts, introduce their own production and work conditions, solicit the other party's requirements and opinions on industrial products or agricultural products, encourage each other to work hard in production, and establish regular contacts separately, so that through mutual encouragement and supervision, they can better complete the 1954 production plan.

### 必须在春节期间加强进行工农联盟的宣传教育

    必须在春节期间加强进行工农联盟的宣传教育
    我们的国家是以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家。我国新民主主义革命的胜利和国民经济恢复工作的完成，都是依靠着工人和农民的亲密联盟取得的。国家过渡时期总路线的实现，更有赖于发挥工人阶级的领导作用，加强工人和农民的亲密团结；工农联盟不仅是我国人民民主专政的基础，而且是建设社会主义和完成社会主义改造的基本力量。因此，尽一切努力继续加强工农联盟，乃是全国人民长期的重要的任务。
    我们党和政府的一切方针政策，都是以加强工农联盟为出发点而制订的。几年以来，党和政府采取一切措施，不断发展工农业生产，逐步降低工业品的价格，开展物资交流工作，运送工业品下乡，以满足农民日益增长的需要；同时号召和组织农民把粮食和经济作物卖给国家，以支持工业和满足工人的需要；工人和农民的生活逐年有所改善，结果，工农联盟的物质基础一天天更加坚实起来。
    工人和农民的日常联系，随着城乡对立状况的消灭，也一天天地加强了。解放以后，各地党和政府组织了各种各样的有利于加强工农了解和联系的活动。例如：发动工人下乡访问农民，在农民遭受水旱灾害时以机器和技术帮助农民；组织农民参观工厂；召开工人、农民的联欢会、座谈会等。大张旗鼓地向工人、农民宣传国家过渡时期总路线以来，全国各地许多著名的工业劳动模范和农业劳动模范、农业生产合作社、互助组互相通信，报告自己的生产成绩，表示加强工农联盟的决心，勉励对方在生产战线上取得更大的成就。工人和农民的联系，在总路线的鼓舞之下，是比过去更加密切了。
    随着工农业生产的日益发展，就出现了若干新的情况和新的问题。例如：农民为了发展生产和改善生活，要求工人供给更多更好的工业品；工人为了继续发展工业，要求农民供给更多的粮食、副食品和工业原料作物。同时，由于工农联系日益密切，工农接触日益频繁，过去和自己没有关系的事情现在有关系了，过去不容易发生误解的地方现在也发生了，如果对这些新问题处理不当，也容易使工农关系发生一些不正常的现象。事实上，在某些个别的地方，如有个别的工人只看到农民的落后面，认为农民自私、保守，因而看不起他们，对他们摆威风，讲排场，骄傲自大，盛气凌人；少数工人有了余钱，不是存入国家银行以帮助国家建设并合理地安排自己的生活，而是挥霍浪费，大吃大喝，甚至囤粮、买地、放债、作投机生意、开铺子当小老板，这都引起了农民的反感和不满。而另一方面，有些农民由于不了解工业是怎么回事，工人的劳动和生活又是怎么回事，竟误认为工人的工作非常清闲，工资太高，生活太好。
    形成这种现象的原因，除了某些工人和农民确实存在着若干缺点和弱点以外，主要是由于我们过去在农村中和厂矿中对工人和农民进行工农联盟的教育和宣传不够，以致某些工人、农民常常只看到对方的缺点，而忽略了对方基本的、主要的方面。我们必须改变这种情况，把宣传工农联盟作为一个极为重要的任务，作为今后长期对人民群众进行过渡时期总路线宣传的一个重要部分。这种宣传教育工作随时都应进行，在今年春节期间，更应该大规模地集中地进行一次。因为春节期间，许多工人，特别是建筑工人，将要回乡休假；许多农民将要到城市、工厂看望自己的子弟。春节是一年之中工农直接联系最普遍、最频繁的时机。利用这个机会以工农互相访问联欢的方式，来对工农群众进行关于工农联盟的教育，造成工农相互信任、相互支持、相互友爱的空气，显然是十分必要和可能的。
    进行这个宣传教育的目的，是要使全体工人和农民都懂得工人和农民、工业和农业、城市和乡村必须互相支援的道理，懂得国家过渡时期总路线完全符合工人、农民的利益的道理，懂得工农利益完全一致的道理，使农民懂得必须依靠工人阶级的领导，使工人懂得必须在国家建设与日常行动中起模范作用的道理。
    我们必须向农民说明白：工人阶级是最革命的阶级，工人常年进行劳动，他们的劳动非常紧张。工人劳动生产的价值比农民要大许多倍，工人的收入（工资）看起来比农民多，但工人拿到的工资只相当他们创造的价值的很小部分，不像农民除了缴纳一定数量的农业税以外，一切收入都归自己。而且城市生活开支较大，衣、食、住、行都得用钱，工人个人又没有生产资料，没有副业收入，一切生活费用都靠工资，因此，工人的生活，特别是子女多的工人的生活，实际上并不算宽裕，有许多人还是比较困难的。我们还必须向农民说明白：近几年来，由于我国经济建设的迅速发展，大量小生产者和其他阶级的成员涌到工人阶级的队伍中来，这些人难免要带来原阶级的思想意识和不良习惯；我国工人阶级长期生活在小私有者的包围中，又和资产阶级经常进行多方面的接触，这就必然要受到它们的不良思想、习惯的影响和侵蚀；这就是少数工人在生活上、作风上表现出的一些缺点的根源。应该指出：故意破坏工农关系的坏分子必然会受到人民政府应有的惩戒，少数工人存在着的这些缺点，在党和工会的教育与全国人民的帮助下，是能够很快地得到改正的。我们还要向广大农民说明白：许多农民对“城里人”有一种传统的成见，现在应该加以改变了。解放以前，帝国主义、蒋介石反动政府和地主阶级都是以城市为据点，残酷地压迫和剥削农民；城市和乡村之间隔着一条沟，因此造成农民对“城里人”的笼统的反感和不满。其实，工人阶级在那种黑暗的年月中，所受的压迫和剥削比农民还要惨重。工人阶级为了摆脱这种压迫和剥削，在城市进行了长期的、艰苦的革命斗争，并由自己的先锋队——共产党派遣自己的党员和工人，深入广大农村，领导农民进行反帝反封建的革命，结果彻底打败了人民的敌人，取得新民主主义革命的胜利。但在革命胜利以后，工人阶级领导的人民政府管理城市以后，城乡关系已经发生了根本的变化。现在的城市再不是压迫乡村的据点，而是工人阶级从生产上、从文化上援助农民的基地，是领导农村不断前进的堡垒了。我们必须向农民说明白：工人阶级领导的国家要求农民把粮食和原料供给工人，要求调剂一些土地来修建工厂和铁路，并不是为了工人的私利，而是为了在我国建设社会主义，为了工人、农民和全国人民的幸福。因此，农民支援工业建设绝不是什么“吃亏”的事。农民再不该歧视“城里人”，而应该支持城市，帮助城市了。
    在进行工农联盟宣传的时候，我们又必须向工人群众说明白：农民是工人阶级最可靠的同盟军，农民在过去的民主革命阶段和国民经济恢复过程中，都尽了很大的力量，有很大的功劳；农民完全可能在工人阶级领导下进入社会主义；工人阶级要把我们的国家建设成富强、幸福的社会主义国家，必须取得农民的赞助。为了实现国家的社会主义工业化，必须相应地发展农业，必须用我们现有的工业力量积极援助农民，如果没有农业的发展，没有足够的粮食和经济作物，国家的社会主义工业化是不可能实现的。现在的乡村正在积极地支援城市，而乡村所以愿意支援城市，是因为城市能够领导乡村，因此，以工人阶级为主体的城市必须首先积极帮助乡村，以取得乡村对城市的帮助。我们还要向工人说明白：农民是有保守、自私、落后等缺点这一面的，但农民还有主要的一面，即革命的，能够跟着工人阶级走进社会主义的一面。而农民的这些缺点，也是由于小农经济不稳定，长期遭受压迫、剥削因而十分贫困的结果，是我们对农民的政治教育还不够深入、不够普遍的结果。许多工人不久以前还是农民，他们对这种情况应该是很清楚的。我们应该关心农民的生活疾苦，帮助农民克服这些缺点，把农民引到互助合作的道路上来。但工人群众为了帮助农民克服缺点，必须首先克服自己的缺点，高度发扬自己的模范作用和领导责任，否则，所谓帮助农民就要变成一句空话。
    为了使这次宣传工作能够切实收到成效，还必须分别在工人和农民中进行许多必要的准备工作。对于准备回乡休假的工人，要求他们在懂得上述道理后，回到乡村，积极向农民进行总路线和工农联盟的宣传，帮助农民了解工业建设的状况；对农民努力生产粮食和工业原料以支援工业建设的行动表示感谢；并应结合农村各项工作任务，鼓励自己的家属亲友带头响应党和政府的号召，安心农村工作，发展农业生产，踊跃把余粮卖给国家，积极参加互助合作运动，努力作好农业增产的准备工作，踊跃购买国家建设公债和积极参加基层选举。回乡工人还应该在日常行动方面，向农民显示工人阶级的组织性和纪律性，给农民树立良好的榜样。最好启发回乡工人经过讨论，订出回乡纪律，如不侮慢农民，不和农民吵嘴，不进行赌博和迷信活动，不大吃大喝，不买地，不放债，不囤粮，不搞投机生意，切实遵守政府法令和农村秩序，等等。各厂矿的党组织和工会应该采取适当方式，组织留厂职工和附近农民进行联欢，或邀请农村干部和农民到工厂参观访问，或组织工人访问农民，借以加强工农之间的了解。各地厂矿的党组织还应在厂矿附近的农民中进行一定范围的必要的政治工作，对于职工中发生的破坏工农团结的行为，及时进行教育纠正，对于工农之间发生的某些误会和纠纷，协同当地农村的党组织和政府迅速予以解决。在春节期间，各厂矿党委应检查一次和附近农民的关系，对过去影响工农关系而又尚未处理的事件，认真进行一次妥善的处理。在处理这种事件的时候，最好邀请有关的工农代表参加，对他们进行直接的教育。各地农村的党组织除了应该对农民进行工农联盟的教育外，凡有休假回乡工人的地方，要组织农村工作干部和农民对工人表示慰问；如果条件允许，可以组织农民到附近工厂参观；此外，还可发动农民和工人联欢，发动农民给工人写信，以加深工农间的相互了解，鼓舞农民群众发展生产和互助合作的积极性。
    联欢会是交流情感、密切联系的一种极为有效的形式。在抗日战争和人民解放战争期间，各解放区常常在春节期间和其他适当时机，组织军民联欢会，由军民双方在会上分别报告战争和生产的情况，相互提出要求，彼此进行鼓励，并分别进行适当的自我批评，这对军队的拥政爱民和农民的拥军优属，起了极大的作用。吸收和发扬过去的经验，在今年春节期间，适当地在一切有条件的厂矿和农村中组织工农进行联欢，是完全必要和适当的。这种联欢会应该朴素简便，时间不可过长，要完全适合当地人民的习惯。工农双方在联欢过程中，应该适当地检讨自己的缺点，提出努力的方向，介绍自己的生产和工作状况，向对方征询对于工业品或农产品的要求与意见，互相勉励努力生产，分别建立经常的联系，以便经过互相鼓励和督促，更好地完成一九五四年的生产计划。
