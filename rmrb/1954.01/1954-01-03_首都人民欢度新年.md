    The people of the capital city celebrated the New Year of 1954 with joy and excitement.

    Having successfully completed their annual production and work plans, the people of the capital, in a cheerful mood, went to theaters and cinemas to enjoy newly performed excellent dramas and films during the New Year. On New Year's Day, the China Peking Opera Troupe performed the newly adapted "Hunting the Tiger" and "The Story of the Embroidered Ball." The China Pingju Opera Troupe performed "Qin Xianglian" and "Luohan Money." The Central Experimental Opera House staged the famous operas "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" and musical dances.

Eleven cinemas including the Capital and Dahua simultaneously screened the new film "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy." A total of sixty-nine screenings were held from morning to night, all fully booked, with more than 55,000 viewers.

    The cars and trams on the streets of the capital were bustling all day long, even more crowded than usual, carrying hundreds of thousands of workers, soldiers, students, staff from various agencies, and citizens to Beihai Park, Zhongshan Park, Western Suburban Park, Summer Palace, Temple of Heaven, and the Working People's Cultural Palace. All parks in the city were open to the public free of charge on New Year's Day to celebrate the New Year. At the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall, more than 3,500 people watched the Beijing Acrobatic Troupe perform wonderful and moving acrobatics at 1 p.m. A long line formed early in the morning at the entrance of the Working People's Cultural Palace, including workers from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory in the suburbs. The mass amateur cultural troupe of the Chongwen District Cultural Center performed Pingju opera "Women Representative," "Watching the List," and crosstalk and Shandong Kuaishu promoting the general election at the Labor Theater and Cultural Garden. Thousands of people watched more than 100 martial arts athletes from eleven amateur martial arts groups perform a variety of national sports at the stadium. In the evening, the puppet troupe affiliated with the China Youth Art Theater performed stick puppet shows "Yangko," "Reed Catkin Shoal," and "Stopping the Horse at the Pass" in the Friendship Hall. More than 3,000 people danced collectively to light music in the cypress forest of the Cultural Garden. From morning to night, more than 70,000 people came to the Working People's Cultural Palace to sing and dance to their heart's content.

    On New Year's Day, more than 10,000 young men and women came to the Beijing People's Ice Skating Rink, Beihai Park, Zhongshan Park, the Working People's Cultural Palace and other skating rinks. Skating enthusiasts danced gracefully on the ice to beautiful music. There was also an ice hockey friendship match in Tsinghua Garden.

    During the New Year, cultural and recreational activities were even more lively in factories and on construction sites. The employees of the Beijing People's Printing Factory invited the Beijing Acrobatic Troupe to hold an all-night New Year's Eve party to welcome the arrival of the New Year. On New Year's Day evening, they held a Peking Opera evening to entertain elderly workers and their families, with wonderful performances by the factory's amateur Peking Opera group. The employees of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, who completed the annual production plan a month ahead of schedule, held a New Year's Day dance at the factory's trade union club. The workers constructing the capital, having completed more than 2.5 million square meters of construction area for the year, launched a variety of cultural and recreational activities on the construction sites. More than 4,000 workers at the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory construction site held a large-scale evening party on New Year's Eve.

    Government agencies and schools also organized New Year's parties. The newly built high-rise buildings in the western suburban cultural and educational district were brightly lit at night. The students of the Beijing Mining College, who had just moved into the cultural and educational district, decorated the classrooms of the three-story building into a very spectacular "Entertainment Building" on New Year's Eve, and groups of future builders of the motherland sang and danced until late at night. Tsinghua University students, to thank the Soviet experts and teachers for their hard work throughout the year, held a New Year's entertainment party on New Year's Day afternoon to entertain the Soviet experts and teachers. Many agencies held parties on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day evening. People talked about the past great year and congratulated each other on achieving new successes in 1954.
