　　Actively Cultivating Advanced Construction Talents for the Country
　　Significant Development in the National Higher Education Undertaking
    Xinhua News Agency, 29th. In the first year of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan, new institutions of higher learning urgently needed for the country's economic construction, such as metallurgy, machinery, petroleum, and civil engineering, were established nationwide. These institutions have provided a considerable number of advanced construction talents to various construction departments, and a large number of workers and peasants have entered universities.

    The newly established institutions of higher learning in 1953, based on adjustments, are of particular importance in ensuring the supply of technical cadres in heavy industry, defense industry, and geology and construction closely related to them. The newly established Beijing Petroleum Institute and Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology are the first specialized colleges in China specializing in petroleum and ferrous metallurgy. The Beijing Petroleum Institute specializes in training senior technical cadres in petroleum exploitation, refining, and petroleum field and refinery machinery. The independent establishment of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology has created conditions for the relatively large-scale training of technical cadres in mining, steel metallurgy, and metallurgical plant machinery and equipment. The newly established Central China Institute of Technology, which trains personnel in machinery manufacturing, power, and power machinery manufacturing, has also reached a considerable scale. The establishment of this institute has greatly enhanced China's strength in training mechanical and power technology personnel. The newly established Central South Civil Engineering and Architectural Institute focuses on training cadres in railway, highway, industrial, and civil construction to meet the needs of the country's basic construction endeavors. While developing higher industrial schools, higher transportation schools were developed accordingly in 1953. In addition to strengthening higher railway schools and river transport colleges, the Dalian Maritime College was newly established. Comprehensive universities across the country have also been generally strengthened and have undergone great development. It has been clarified that comprehensive universities are the foundation of higher education institutions and research institutions and are an important symbol of the country's cultural and scientific development, which has encouraged teachers and students' confidence in teaching and learning. Higher normal education is the key to running and developing secondary education well, and running and developing secondary education well is closely related to cultivating national construction talents and improving people's cultural level. Therefore, many higher normal schools were independently established in 1953. There are now thirty-one higher normal schools nationwide, with more students than the largest number in the history of old China (1946). Among them, Shenyang Normal College, Fujian Normal College, Anhui Normal College, Hunan Normal College, Guangxi Normal College, Jiangxi Normal College, and Xi'an Normal College were all newly built independently after adjustments in 1953, laying the foundation for the large-scale training of secondary school teachers. Five new higher physical education schools were also established (Northwest Institute of Physical Education has not yet been established). After the adjustments in 1953, higher education institutions across the country basically changed the situation of the old-style universities' complex departments and unreasonable distribution, and embarked on the road of cultivating specialized talents to meet the needs of national construction. The original nine universities in Shanxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Henan, Nanchang, Central Plains, Anhui, Fuzhou, and Guizhou have been completely reorganized, and the original departments have been separated or merged according to their nature. Some specialized colleges that were affiliated to comprehensive universities in 1952 have been merged into other specialized colleges or independently established as new-style universities with clear training goals.

    In the new period of China's planned economic construction, where there is a particular lack of construction personnel in all aspects, higher education institutions across the country provided more than 41,000 graduates in various disciplines to the country in 1953, which played a great role in construction work and solved the great difficulty of lacking cadres in various business departments, especially industrial production and construction departments. Many graduates, upon arriving at their work posts, were encouraged by the motherland's great construction cause and displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, making preliminary achievements. This group of graduates has received several years of education and training from the Party and the government, possesses a certain level of Marxism-Leninism, and has mastered general scientific theories and professional knowledge and technology. They are now distributed in factories, mines, exploration teams, farms, schools, hospitals, and government enterprises across the country, becoming a very important force in the construction cause. In completing the enrollment plan in 1953, the political quality of new students in higher education institutions across the country was better, and a relatively large number of workers and peasants were admitted to higher education institutions. Among the more than 71,000 new students who enrolled in the autumn of 1953, worker and peasant students accounted for more than 40 percent, and Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members accounted for 37.36 percent. This is an important achievement of schools at all levels in implementing the policy of opening to workers and peasants and strengthening the work of the Party and Youth League organizations in schools. The injection of this new blood into higher education institutions is of great significance in changing the composition of students in higher education institutions.

    Solving the problem of teachers is the key to developing higher education so that it can correspondingly cultivate construction talents for the country. In 1953, higher education institutions across the country made great efforts and supplemented more than 3,800 new assistant teachers. A large number of new teachers are growing up. They are undergoing planned business studies under the specific help of the teaching and research groups and veteran teachers in various schools, and a group of new teachers have started classes. These new teachers are generally welcomed by students because they actively learn from the Soviet Union and are enthusiastic and responsible. Veteran teachers have also strengthened research work. New and old teachers unite and cooperate, study hard, and ensure that the quality of teaching is gradually improved. The teaching reform work of higher education institutions across the country has achieved preliminary experience, and teaching work has gradually become standardized. Some higher education institutions with better conditions, especially some comprehensive universities, have initially carried out scientific research work due to the foundation of teaching work.

    In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the national talent cultivation plan, higher education institutions (excluding higher normal schools) and worker-peasant rapid middle schools carried out a considerable scale of basic construction work in 1953. The total construction area for the year reached 1.3 million square meters. The amount of construction work in the past year is equivalent to 34.1% of the total construction area of ​​junior colleges and universities in old China for fifty years. The newly built and expanded school buildings include 103 higher education institutions and worker-peasant rapid middle schools. The construction project focuses on engineering, with the total construction area of ​​higher industrial schools being approximately 720,000 square meters, accounting for 60% of the total construction area; at the same time, it also appropriately meets the teaching needs of comprehensive universities, agriculture and forestry, medicine, finance and economics, political science and law, language, art, physical education, and other higher education institutions.

　　积极为国家培养高级建设人材
　　全国高等教育事业有显著发展
    【新华社二十九日讯】在祖国第一个五年计划的第一年，全国新建立了为国家经济建设所急需的冶金、机械、石油和土木建筑等高等学校。这些高等学校为各种建设部门输送了相当数量的高级建设人材，并有大批工农青年进入了大学。
    一九五三年在调整基础上新建立的高等学校，对保证国家重工业、国防工业及与此密切相关的地质、建筑方面技术干部的供应有特别重要的意义。新建立的北京石油工业学院和北京钢铁工业学院是我国第一次设置的单科性石油和黑色冶金的专门学院。北京石油工业学院专门培养石油开采、炼制和石油矿场与炼厂机械的高级技术干部。北京钢铁工业学院的独立建校，就为比较大量地培养采矿、钢铁冶金和冶金厂机械设备的技术干部创造了条件。新建立的培养机械制造、动力及动力机械制造人材的华中工学院也已经具备了相当规模，该校的建立大大增强了我国培养机械和动力技术人材的力量。新建立的中南土木建筑学院为了满足国家基本建设事业的需要，集中培养有关铁路、公路、工业与民用建筑事业的干部。与发展高等工业学校的同时，一九五三年相应地发展了高等交通学校，除加强了高等铁道学校、河运学院外，还新建立了大连海运学院。全国综合大学也普遍加强并有很大发展，明确了综合大学是高等学校和研究机构的基础，是国家文化科学发展的重要标志，鼓舞了师生教学和学习的信心。高等师范教育是办好和发展中等教育的关键，而办好和发展中等教育又与培养国家建设人材和提高人民文化水平有着密切关系。因此，一九五三年独立建立了许多高等师范学校。现全国高等师范学校已有三十一所，在校学生超过旧中国历史上最多学生数（一九四六年）一倍以上。其中如沈阳师范学院、福建师范学院、安徽师范学院、湖南师范学院、广西师范学院、江西师范学院、西安师范学院等校，都是在一九五三年调整后独立新建的，为大量培养中等学校师资打下了基础，并新建了五所高等体育学校（其中西北体育学院尚未成立）。全国高等学校经过一九五三年的调整，基本上改变了旧制大学院系庞杂、设置分布不合理的状态，走上了适应国家建设需要培养专业人材的道路。原山西、湖南、广西、河南、南昌、中原、安徽、福州、贵州等九大学已彻底改组，原有各院系都按性质分别独立或归并。一九五二年还附设在综合大学的一些专门学院，应该调整的大部分已分别并入其他专门学院或独立建校，成为培养目标明确的新制大学。
      在我国开始进入有计划的经济建设新时期各方面特别缺乏建设人材的情况下，全国高等学校在一九五三年度为国家输送了四万一千多名各科毕业生，对建设工作起了很大作用，解决了各业务部门特别是工业生产和建设部门缺乏干部的很大困难。许多毕业生一到工作岗位上，为祖国伟大的建设事业所鼓舞，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，作出了初步成绩。这批毕业生受了党和政府几年的教育和培养，已具备一定的马克思列宁主义水平，掌握了一般科学理论和专业知识与技术，现在分布在全国各地的工厂、矿山、勘探队、农场、学校、医院和机关企业中，成为建设事业中一个很重要的力量。一九五三年全国高等学校在完成招生计划中，新生政治质量较好，吸收了比较大量的工农青年进入了高等学校，在一九五三年秋季入学的全国七万一千多名新生中，工农学生占百分之四十以上，共产党员和青年团员占百分之三十七点三六，这是各级学校贯彻向工农开门的方针和学校共产党、青年团组织工作加强的重要成果，这批新的血液注入高等学校，对改变高等学校学生成分有重要意义。
    解决师资问题是发展高等教育事业使之相应地为国家培养建设人材的关键。一九五三年全国高等学校作了很大努力，补充了三千八百多名新助教，大批新师资正在成长起来，他们在各校教研组和老教师的具体帮助下有计划地进行业务进修，并有一批新教师开了课。这些新教师由于积极学习苏联，热情负责，他们所开课程，一般都受到学生的欢迎。老教师们也加强了研究工作。新老教师团结合作，努力学习，保证了教学质量逐步提高。全国高等学校的教学改革工作已经取得了初步经验，教学工作已逐步走上正轨。一些条件较好的高等学校，特别是一部分综合大学由于教学工作有了基础，科学研究工作也初步开展起来。
    为了保证国家培养建设人材计划的顺利进行，一九五三年全国高等学校（高等师范学校不计算在内）和工农速成中学进行了相当规模的基本建设工作。全年建筑面积达一百三十万平方公尺。去年一年的建筑工程量相当于旧中国大专学校五十年建筑面积总和的百分之三十四点一。新建和扩建校舍的包括一百零三所高等学校和工农速成中学。建筑工程以工科为重点，高等工业学校建筑总面积约七十二万平方公尺，占建筑总面积百分之六十；同时也适当地满足了综合大学、农林、医药、财经、政法、语文、艺术、体育等科高等学校的教学需要。
