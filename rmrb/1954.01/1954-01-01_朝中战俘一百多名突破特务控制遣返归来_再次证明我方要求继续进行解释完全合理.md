Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 31st: Today, one hundred and twenty-eight Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, under the supervision of the Indian Custodial Forces, risked their lives to break through special agent control and demanded repatriation during the headcount. They, along with three Korean People's Army prisoners of war who climbed through the barbed wire, were repatriated at 7 PM tonight. Upon returning to Panmunjom, they excitedly shouted slogans such as "Oppose the American Imperialists' Forcible Detention of Prisoners of War." The return of over one hundred Korean and Chinese prisoners of war today is a heavy blow to the American side's plot to unilaterally terminate the explanation work and forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. It once again exposes the American side's lie about prisoners of war "preferring death to repatriation" as a despicable falsehood. Their return further proves that the Korean and Chinese side's demand to continue the explanation work is entirely necessary and reasonable.

The one hundred and twenty-eight Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war belong to camps 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12 of Sector B. They said that the special agent leaders in the camps knew a few days ago that the Indian Custodial Forces would be conducting a headcount today. In order to prevent many prisoners of war who longed to return home from taking the opportunity to apply for repatriation, they had been intimidating the prisoners of war in various ways overnight. The special agents in each camp also received instructions from Taiwanese Kuomintang special agents in the U.S. Army's 64th Field Hospital, forcing each prisoner of war to carry a slip of paper with "Return to Taiwan" written in English and Chinese to hand to the Indians during the headcount. The special agents also sharpened knives and collected wooden sticks overnight, preparing to attack and prevent prisoners of war from applying for repatriation, creating an atmosphere of terror. Prisoners of war Wang Zijiang and Liu Changhua from Camp 5 were occasionally talking about family matters when they were dragged to the "squad headquarters" and beaten. Prisoner of war Chen Futai from Camp 7 was wearing three layers of clothing because of the cold, and the special agents said he was trying to escape and forced him to take them off.

Today, when the Indian Custodial Forces were conducting a headcount in each camp of Sector B, the special agents in each camp were monitoring the actions of every prisoner of war with sharpened knives and thick baseball bats. At the gate of each camp, several special agent leaders armed with weapons stood guard. But despite this, more than one hundred prisoners of war disregarded their own safety and rushed out to demand repatriation. When Zhang Deyou, who returned from Camp 5, rushed towards the gate, a special agent grabbed him and pulled out a knife to stab him. Fortunately, an Indian soldier blocked it, and he was not injured.

All returnees said that since hearing that the explanation work would no longer be carried out, the prisoners of war were extremely anxious. However, the special agents said: After the explanation ends, the Indian troops will only be responsible for guarding and will no longer be responsible for repatriation. Anyone who escapes from the barbed wire will have to be returned to their original camp. These words from the special agents made the prisoners of war even more fearful and suspicious. The returnees demanded that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission immediately break through the special agent control and resume the explanation work for Korean and Chinese prisoners of war so that prisoners of war can have the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation.

The returnees said that after the American side unilaterally terminated the explanation work, the special agents in each camp intensified their reign of terror more frantically, and at the same time, actively prepared to abduct prisoners of war to escape. The special agents told the prisoners of war that on January 22nd, the American army would use planes and warships to transport the prisoners of war to South Korea and Taiwan. The special agents also arbitrarily threatened that if the Indian troops tried to stop them, the Li pseudo-army would be deployed to fight.

### 朝中战俘一百多名突破特务控制遣返归来  再次证明我方要求继续进行解释完全合理

    朝中战俘一百多名突破特务控制遣返归来
    再次证明我方要求继续进行解释完全合理
    【新华社开城三十一日电】今天有一百二十八名中国人民志愿军被俘人员在印度看管部队执行看管任务——查点人数时，冒死突破特务控制要求遣返，他们已与三名翻铁丝网出来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员一同在今晚七时遣返归来。他们回到板门店时，激动地高呼“反对美帝国主义强迫扣留战俘”的口号。今天一百多名朝中被俘人员的归来是对美方片面终止解释工作、强迫扣留朝中被俘人员阴谋的一次沉重打击，使美方所谓战俘“宁死不愿遣返”的谎言又一次遭到可耻的破产。他们的归来，又一次证明朝中方面要求继续进行解释是完全必要而且合理的。
    一百二十八名志愿军被俘人员分别属于B营区第四、五、六、七、八、九、十二等营场。他们说，营场里的特务头子前几天已知道印度看管部队要在今天点名，为了防止会有许多渴望回国的战俘乘机申请遣返，曾连夜对战俘进行种种恫吓。各个营场的特务们并接到美军第六十四野战医院里的台湾国民党特务的指示，强迫每个战俘都带一张英文和中文写的“回台湾”的纸条子，在点名时交给印度人。特务们并连夜赶磨刀子，搜集木棒，准备在战俘申请遣返时就行凶阻止，造成恐怖气氛。第五号营场战俘王子江和刘长华偶而在一起谈谈家事，被特务们拉到“中队部”去吊打了一顿。第七号营场战俘陈福泰因为天冷而穿了三件衣服，特务们就说他想跑，强迫他脱下来。
    今天，当印度看管部队对B营区各营场点名时，各个营场的特务们都带着磨亮的刀子和粗大的垒球棒子监视着每一个战俘的行动，在每个营场的大门口，都有几个带着凶器的特务头子站在那里。但是尽管这样，还有一百多名战俘不顾生死，冲出来要求遣返。第五号营场归来的张德友向大门口冲出去时，特务曾一把拉住他，掏出刀子就刺，幸而给印度兵挡住，才没有被刺伤。
    所有的归来人员都说，自从听说解释工作不再进行后，战俘们都焦急万分，但是，特务们说过：解释终止后，印度部队只管看管，不再管遣返，有人逃出铁丝网还得送回原营场。特务们的这些话使战俘们更加心怀疑惧。归来人员要求中立国遣返委员会立即打破特务控制，恢复对朝中战俘的解释工作，使战俘能够得到机会行使遣返权利。
    归来人员说，美方片面终止解释工作后，各营场的特务们一面更疯狂地加紧恐怖统治，一面积极进行劫持战俘逃跑的准备工作。特务们告诉战俘，到了一月二十二日，美军将用飞机和军舰把战俘运到南朝鲜和台湾去。特务并且恣意威吓说，如果印度部队拦阻，李伪军即将出动作战。
