Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, January 10th: In 1953, people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region achieved great accomplishments in various economic construction endeavors.

The farmers of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, under the leadership of the Autonomous Region People's Government, increased production. The total grain output of the region increased by 6.6 percent compared to 1952, and by 25 percent compared to the highest pre-war level. After the bumper harvest, the farmers not only improved their living standards but also supplied large quantities of grain to support industrial construction in various regions and meet urban needs. The mutual aid and cooperation movement is steadily developing in the vast rural areas. Farmers of all ethnic groups have organized more than 60,000 permanent and temporary mutual aid teams and established more than 180 agricultural production cooperatives. The People's Government has supported the farmers in various ways, with agricultural loans exceeding 20 billion yuan, enabling farmers to purchase many new-style farm tools, draught animals, seeds, and pesticides. Agricultural technology guidance stations established in various regions help farmers improve their farming techniques.

The herdsmen of all leagues in Inner Mongolia increased their livestock by more than 1.3 million head, exceeding the livestock breeding plan. The total number of livestock in the region is now 1.4 times higher than when the Autonomous Region was established in 1947. In addition to providing livestock loans and conducting widespread livestock disease prevention and control work in pastoral areas, the Autonomous Region People's Government has also mobilized herdsmen to implement mutual aid in labor, prevent natural disasters, and improve feeding management. Most herdsmen in Inner Mongolia, based on the principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, have organized various forms of labor mutual aid suitable for livestock production needs. Herdsmen in Hulunbuir League, Xilin Gol League, and other places have organized thousands of mutual aid teams for disaster prevention and lambing. More than 300 temporary pastoral mutual aid teams throughout the region have been upgraded to permanent mutual aid teams. Various pastoral mutual aid and cooperation organizations have effectively promoted livestock breeding and protection work, uniting and educating tens of thousands of individual herdsmen and pointing out the direction of production development for them.

Local industries closely related to Inner Mongolia's vast fertile grasslands and rural areas experienced vigorous development in 1953. According to incomplete statistics, the region already has more than 160 large and small factories operated by local state-owned and cooperative enterprises, most of which are industries such as milk, leather, and agricultural tool manufacturing. The number of large and small dairy factories in various regions increased to more than 30 in 1953, purchasing more than 20 million catties of milk throughout the year, increasing the income of dairy farmers by more than 10 billion yuan. To support the construction of the motherland, timber production in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area of Inner Mongolia more than doubled that of 1952.

Accompanying the development of various economic construction projects, the purchasing power of the people of Inner Mongolia has increased unprecedentedly. In 1953, the per capita income in rural, pastoral, and forestry areas increased by an average of 120,000 yuan compared to 1952, and the purchasing power increased by an average of more than 35 percent compared to 1952. The purchasing and marketing activities of state-owned trade and cooperatives throughout the region have become increasingly frequent. The total value of industrial products supplied to the market throughout the region increased by 68 percent compared to 1952, and the total value of agricultural products, livestock products, and local specialty products sold abroad through state-owned trading companies also increased by more than a quarter compared to 1952. The sales volume of major daily necessities such as cloth, sugar, and kerosene all greatly exceeded that of 1952. Cooperatives in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia invested 40 billion yuan worth of goods in agricultural areas in the fourth quarter of last year alone.

Inner Mongolia also carried out capital construction with a construction area of more than 255,000 square meters, including the construction or expansion of nine state-owned ranches, stud farms, and a state-owned mechanized farm. In addition, 16 highways with a total length of more than 4,000 kilometers have been built throughout the region.

    内蒙古自治区经济建设成绩显著
   【新华社归绥十日电】一九五三年，内蒙古自治区各族人民在各项经济建设中，获得了很大成就。
    内蒙古的各族农民，在自治区人民政府领导下，提高了生产。全区粮食产量比一九五二年增加百分之六点六，比战前最高水平增加了百分之二十五。丰收后的农民不仅改善了自己的生活，并且将大批粮食支援各地的工业建设和满足城市需要。互助合作运动正在广大农村稳步地发展着，各族农民已组织了六万多个常年的和临时的互助组，并建立了一百八十多个农业生产合作社。人民政府曾经从各方面来扶助农民，仅发放的二百多亿元农业贷款，便使农民添置了许多新式农具、耕畜、种籽和农药。在各地设立的农业技术指导站，帮助农民改进耕作技术。
    内蒙古各盟牧民纯增殖各种牲畜一百三十多万头，超额地完成了牲畜增殖计划。现在全区牲畜总数比一九四七年自治区成立时增加了一点四倍。自治区人民政府在牧区除了发放畜牧贷款、普遍进行畜病防治工作外，还发动牧民实行劳动互助，防止自然灾害和改善饲养管理。内蒙古大多数牧民在自愿互利的原则下，组织了各种适合畜牧业生产需要的劳动互助。呼纳盟、锡林郭勒盟等地牧民就组织了成千个防灾、接羔互助组。全区还有三百多个临时性的牧业互助组已提高为常年互助组。各地牧业互助合作组织有力地推动了增畜保畜工作，并团结和教育成千上万的单干牧民，为他们指出生产发展的方向。
    和内蒙古广阔肥美的草原及农村有密切联系的地方工业，在一九五三年有了蓬勃的发展。据不完全统计，全区已有地方国营及合作社经营的大、小工厂共一百六十多座，其中大部分是牛奶、皮革及农具制造等工业。各地的大、小乳品工厂在一九五三年发展到三十多所，全年收购二千多万斤牛奶，使饲养乳牛的牧民增加了一百多亿元的收入。为了支援祖国建设，内蒙古大兴安岭林区的木材产量超过一九五二年一倍半。
    伴随着各项经济建设的发展，内蒙古人民购买力空前地提高了。一九五三年农村、牧区和林业区每人收入平均比一九五二年增多了十二万元，购买力平均比一九五二年上升了百分之三十五以上。全区国营贸易和合作社购销活动日益频繁。全区供应市场的工业品总值比一九五二年增加了百分之六十八，通过国营贸易公司外销的农产品、畜产品及土特产品总值也较一九五二年增加四分之一以上。人民主要日用品如布匹、糖及煤油等，销售量都大大超过一九五二年。内蒙古东部区合作社去年第四季度一次就在农业区投放了四百亿元的货物。
    内蒙古还进行了建筑面积达二十五万五千多平方公尺的基本建设，其中包括九个国营牧场、种畜场和一个国营机械农场的新建或扩建。此外，全区修通了十六条公路，长达四千多公里。
