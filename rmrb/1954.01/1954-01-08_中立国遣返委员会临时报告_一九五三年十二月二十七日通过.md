The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's Interim Report
Adopted on December 27, 1953

**Part One: The Transfer of Prisoners of War**

**Chapter One**

1. In accordance with the provisions of the "Scope of Authority" Article 1, Paragraph 1 and Article 2, Paragraphs 4 and 5, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission began taking over the non-repatriated prisoners of war on September 10, 1953.

2. The transfer of 22,604 prisoners of war held by the United Nations Command was completed on September 23, 1953. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers also completed the transfer of 359 prisoners of war on September 24, 1953.

3. When the prisoners of war arrived at the southern camp, they exhibited violent temperaments, often reaching a state of frenzy. However, the Indian guard troops received them unarmed, and there were no instances of resorting to force.

4. The United Nations Command alleged that the disturbances among the prisoners of war were caused by the presence of representatives from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. These representatives, totaling five in number, were present daily, as stipulated by the "Scope of Authority" Article 1, Paragraph 1, to observe the work of the Commission along with the United Nations Command representatives.

5. The United Nations Command alleged:
   The presence of observers is a violation of the "Scope of Authority." In a letter dated September 12, 1953, to the Chairman of the Commission, General Harrison stated:
   "The unfortunate disturbances in the camps within the demilitarized zone are clearly due to the presence of identifiable Communist personnel. If the Communist representatives did not insist on being present, there would be very little possibility of any disturbances occurring. When we drafted the 'Scope of Authority,' the prisoners of war were still far in the rear of South Korea. At that time, it was considered that the transfer work was purely unilateral, and we were merely handing over the prisoners of war to the Indian troops in the already established and operational camps. During our negotiations, there was never any consideration of allowing the other side's personnel to observe this work. Only during the ninety-day interpretation period were the other side's representatives and observers allowed to appear in the camps. Therefore, according to the armistice negotiations, during the actual transfer period, there was no need for observers from either side to be present. We conducted explanations of the armistice agreement and the 'Scope of Authority' to the prisoners of war, assuming that this was purely a unilateral matter, in order to alleviate the fears of anti-Communist prisoners of war and to gain their cooperation so that they could be peacefully moved to the demilitarized zone. Therefore, this new development naturally made them doubt the sincerity of the United Nations Command and the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. At this final stage, if it is not impossible, it would be difficult to make the prisoners of war believe that in this matter, which was previously told to them as purely unilateral, Communist observers and other Communist personnel must participate. Moreover, from a strict military point of view, if there were no observers present when the Indian troops received the prisoners of war, it would certainly be advantageous for the Indian troops." (See Appendix 1)

6. The unanimous opinion of the Commission is that the United Nations Command's interpretation of the presence of observers is incorrect, and it is believed that according to the "Scope of Authority" Article 1, taking over the prisoners of war is "a task of the Commission," and both sides' representatives have the right to be present to observe this work. The Chairman of the Commission explained this position in his reply to General Harrison's letter as follows:
   "Regarding the presence of observers from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, I would like to point out that regardless of your intentions when drafting the 'Scope of Authority,' we are bound only by the terms agreed upon by both sides. This matter has been carefully considered by the Commission and its legal experts, and the Commission's conclusion is that the Commission cannot refuse the presence of observers during the handover. I would like to refer to Article 1, which seems to be very clear and does not allow for any other interpretation that would facilitate the work of the Indian guard troops. Article 1 clearly states 'the establishment of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to receive... prisoners of war, etc.,' and the last sentence states 'representatives of both sides shall be allowed to observe the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its subordinate organizations, including explanations and visits.' Your opinion is that the only work that the negotiators of the armistice agreement anticipated and expected the observers of both sides to attend was 'the interpretation work during the ninety-day period.' The last sentence of the quoted Article 1 envisages that observers can be present not only in the case of 'interpretation and visits' but also in other cases. The Commission believes that the taking over of prisoners of war and, at the appropriate time, the repatriation of prisoners of war, like the interpretation work, are all tasks of the Commission. You also said that when drafting the 'Scope of Authority,' the prisoners of war were far in the rear of South Korea, and therefore, it was never considered that in addition to unilaterally handing over these prisoners of war to the Indian guard troops, they would be handed over to anyone else. However, Article 2, Paragraph 4 clearly states that prisoners of war should be released from the military control and custody of the detaining side as soon as possible and handed over to the 'Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.' The same paragraph also mentions that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is responsible for the management of the places where prisoners of war reside. These two paragraphs clearly indicate that the management is the management of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission through its agent, the Indian guard troops. Therefore, after considerable consideration, the Commission concluded: 'According to the "Scope of Authority," the Commission cannot but give both sides the right to send observer groups during the handover work.'" (See Appendix 1)

7. The Commission had requested both sides to consider waiving their right to send observers. The United Nations Command agreed to the Commission's suggestion, but the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers refused to waive their right. In a letter dated September 14, 1953, to the Chairman of the Commission, General Li Xiangzhao stated: "I believe it is necessary to point out that the difficulties encountered by the Indian guard troops in taking over the prisoners of war held by the United Nations Command in the past few days are entirely due to the sabotage and planned disturbances by spies mixed among the non-repatriated prisoners of war, and not due to the presence of our observers and interpreters. If the dispatch of observers is stopped now, it would not only be contrary to the agreement but would also give the spies and their supporters a victory, making it even more difficult for the Indian guard troops to maintain order in the prisoner of war camps in the future. We cannot agree to this. We will continue to send observers to observe in accordance with the agreement." (See Appendix 1)

**Chapter Two**

8. When the Commission began to take responsibility for the custody of the prisoners of war, it was evident that they lacked a proper understanding of the "Scope of Authority," and it seemed that they had not been fully informed of their rights and obligations as stipulated in the "Scope of Authority."

   To remedy this situation, the Commission decided to act in accordance with Article 9, Paragraph 22 of the "Scope of Authority." To this end, the Commission unanimously agreed to distribute a leaflet to the prisoners of war (see Appendix 2) and to broadcast its contents to them.

9. In a letter dated September 28, 1953, the United Nations Command expressed their disagreement with the statements in the leaflet (see Appendix 2). They alleged: "Although the leaflet does not 'substantially deviate from the literal wording of the armistice agreement and the "Scope of Authority," it certainly ignores the clear spirit of it. The wording, phrasing, and strong implications of the leaflet all tend to inappropriately influence both sides' prisoners of war, urging them to be repatriated rather than making a free and independent choice." The Commission could not agree with these objections because the Commission believed that the statements in the leaflet were entirely in accordance with the "Scope of Authority" (see Appendix 2).

10. The Commission could not definitely say what impact the distribution and broadcasting of the leaflet had on all the prisoners of war. Often, the leaflets were found torn up. In some camps, the broadcasts were either rendered ineffective by deliberately organized noise or by the cutting of the loudspeaker wires in the prisoner of war camps. However, on one issue, the prisoners of war, or at least their "representatives" (Note 1), continued to have misunderstandings, namely, they believed that they had no obligation to attend the explanations conducted by the side to which they legally belonged. This issue will be discussed in the part of the report that deals with the conduct of the explanations.

   [Note 1] It should be clearly understood that the Commission had neither the time nor the means to ascertain the representativeness of the leaders in the prisoner of war camps. The organization and leadership in the camps remained the same as before they were handed over to the Commission for custody. Therefore, these "representatives" cannot be considered as representatives in the sense envisaged by Articles 79 to 81 of the Geneva Convention.

11. In addition to the lack of understanding and misconceptions exposed by the prisoners of war, the Commission also learned that the prisoners of war handed over to it by the United Nations Command were tightly organized. The main purpose of this organization was to resist repatriation and to prevent those who wished to be repatriated from exercising this right. To achieve this purpose, some prisoners of war had used force against other prisoners of war, resulting in any prisoner of war who wished to be repatriated having to do so secretly and at the risk of their life. The Commission could not say how and under what conditions the prisoners of war were organized under certain leadership. However, at least one thing was clear: they were handed over to the Commission in an organized manner as described above.

12. On September 20, 1953, the Czechoslovakian member of the Commission proposed a resolution (see Appendix 3), which, among other things, called for immediate steps to be taken to break up the existing organizations in the prisoner of war camps, to isolate the "spies and spy leaders," and to place them in isolation (Note 2).

   [Note 2] The Czechoslovakian and Polish members of the Commission stated on September 10, 1953, that the "representatives" and other troublemakers should be isolated, and the prisoner of war camps should be reorganized to disrupt the organizations that had been established under the original detaining country. They asserted that unless such changes were made, the Commission's work in the future would either be completely impossible or seriously hampered. They proposed that the reorganization of the camps and the re-grouping of the prisoners of war should be carried out simultaneously with the handover work.

13. The resolution mentioned in the above paragraph was the subject of very thorough debate and was put to a vote at the Commission's tenth meeting on September 21, 1953, where it was defeated. The views of the Commission's members on the issues raised in the Czechoslovakian member's resolution are explained in paragraphs 14 to 16.

14. The arguments of the Polish and Czechoslovakian members were: the organizations and leadership within the prisoner of war camps were essentially terrorist in nature, and their purpose was to intimidate prisoners of war with violence to prevent them from exercising their right to be repatriated. They believed that the Commission could not recognize these organizations and their leadership because these organizations were established before the prisoners of war were handed over to the Commission for custody. Unless these organizations were dissolved and their leadership removed, it would be impossible to ensure the implementation of the "Scope of Authority" regarding the repatriation of willing prisoners of war in Article 1, Paragraph 3. They believed that, according to the Geneva Convention, the only organizations and leadership that the Commission could recognize were those based on the dissolution of existing organizations, the creation of normal conditions in the prisoner of war camps, and thus enabling prisoners of war to freely elect their own leaders.

15. The view of the Swedish member, with the agreement of the Swiss member, was: the fact that the prisoners of war were organized when they arrived here is a fact. They believed that, according to the general spirit of the Geneva Convention, prisoners of war should be allowed to remain in their organized groups. However, regarding the punishment of troublemakers, the commander of the guard troops should do everything possible to prevent and suppress violent behavior and punish those who can be identified as having committed such acts. They believed that the Commission's primary task at the time was to take over the prisoners of war, and during the interpretation period, to give prisoners of war the opportunity to freely express their opinions.

16. The view of the Indian delegation was: although the isolation and removal of the "spies," "troublemakers," and "ringleaders" from the prisoner of war camps was appropriate, even necessary, there were practical difficulties in achieving this satisfactory result. Therefore, although the Indian delegation sympathized with the views expressed by the Czechoslovakian and Polish members, they felt that the forces at the disposal of the Indian guard troops were insufficient to both ensure the custody of the prisoners of war and to deal with any resistance that the prisoners of war or their leaders might put up against the reorganization. Moreover, the organization of the prisoners of war seemed to be based on very small units of action, so that such units could pass through any reorganization process. Therefore, even if the Indian guard troops had the manpower to carry out the reorganization, the effort expended and the results achieved compared to the risks taken would be disproportionate. Moreover, there was the further difficulty of identifying "spies." The Indian delegation felt that as soon as the handover of the prisoners of war was completed and the strength of the guard troops was increased, every effort would be made in the second phase of the Commission's work to ensure that every prisoner of war was reasonably free from the threat of any existing organization and that every prisoner of war could consider and decide for themselves.

17. Since the beginning of the Commission's work, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have believed that unless the so-called spy elements in the prisoners of war were isolated and their influence removed, the Commission would not be able to fulfill its obligations to ensure that every prisoner of war had the freedom to choose repatriation without fear or threat of violence. On September 17, 1953, the representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, General Li Xiangzhao, expressed these views in a memorandum (see Appendix 4).

18. The practical difficulties involved in breaking up the prisoner of war organizations and isolating the so-called spies would be considerable. When the Czechoslovakian member of the Commission proposed his resolution on this issue on September 20, 1953, the strength of the Indian guard troops was 1,524 elite riflemen; on September 24, when the Commission completed the handover of 22,604 prisoners of war from the United Nations Command, the strength of the Indian guard troops was still the same as on the 20th, but as an emergency measure, 798 administrative personnel were added to supplement them. The highest strength of the Indian guard troops never exceeded 2,818 riflemen. To carry out the regular duties of guarding the prisoner of war camps, i.e., patrolling in the camp areas and their surrounding watchtowers, 1,347 men were needed every night, and based on the rotation of personnel for overnight rest, 2,694 riflemen were needed, leaving only 124 reserve personnel. This reserve force was for any casualties or any special tasks. Thus, when explanations were given or when large-scale action had to be taken, the Indian guard troops had to use all their personnel, including those who should have rested the previous day. It should also be noted that the southern camp had 55 camp areas divided into 6 enclosures, covering an area of 3.18 square miles. The strength of the guard troops was based on the assumption that they needed to carry out the duty of guarding the prisoners of war to ensure custody and that there would be no large-scale disturbances in the prisoner of war camps. Any attempt to break up the prisoner of war organizations or to isolate their "representatives" would cause a large disturbance. In this situation, there were other difficulties due to the distribution of the prisoner of war camps. Large numbers of prisoners of war were concentrated in each camp area. The camp areas and enclosures were close enough to see and hear each other. In this situation, even a simple action in one camp area would cause disturbances in other camp areas. In the event of large-scale disturbances, the distribution of the camp areas would be a serious obstacle to the work of the Indian guard troops.

**Part Two: Explanations**

**Chapter One: Procedural Rules**

19. Even while engaged in the difficult task of taking over the prisoners of war, the Commission designated a sub-committee to draft regulations for the conduct of explanations in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 8, Sub-paragraph (d) of the "Scope of Authority." The sub-committee, in submitting its interim report, suggested that the sub-committee should invite the United Nations Command and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to submit their respective views on the conduct of explanations. The Commission took action in accordance with this suggestion. The United Nations Command submitted their views in letters dated September 21 and 23, 1953 (see Appendix 5); the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers submitted their views in a letter dated September 22, 1953 (see Appendix 5).

20. The views of both sides on the conduct of explanations were so divergent that no common basis could be found for the Commission's guidance. The Commission, taking into account the situation in the prisoner of war camps and the lack of understanding shown by the prisoners of war of the entire explanation process, had to use its own independent judgment to formulate procedural rules that would ensure the strict implementation of the "Scope of Authority" (see Appendix 5).

21. On September 26, the Commission finally adopted the procedural rules for explanations (see Appendix 5) and sent them to both sides on September 29, 1953.

22. The United Nations Command formally protested against the procedural rules adopted by the Commission. The protest was made in their letter dated October 2, 1953, and the Commission replied to it in a letter from the Chairman of the Commission to Brigadier General Hanbren on October 7, 1953 (see Appendix 6).

23. Although the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers generally agreed with the procedural rules for explanations adopted by the Commission, they raised some criticisms of certain provisions. These views were expressed in a letter from General Li Xiangzhao dated October 12, 1953 (see Appendix 6).

24. In a letter dated October 5, 1953, to the Chairman of the Commission, General Clark outlined the United Nations Command's views on the entire explanation issue. The following are relevant excerpts from that letter (see Appendix 6):
   "In short, the decisions and activities of your Commission, up to this point, seem to be based on the assumption that all the prisoners of war under your custody are truly desirous of repatriation. This is particularly difficult to understand in view of the strong personal and collective opposition expressed by the anti-Communist prisoners of war of Korean and Chinese nationality to the specific appearance of Communist representatives. It seems that your Commission has not fully recognized that the prisoners of war of Korean and Chinese nationality made their choices several months ago, and without the use of force or coercion, the majority of them will adhere to their decisions. If there is any real doubt about the attitude of the prisoners of war, I would be very willing to suggest the use of the provisions of Article 9 of the 'Scope of Authority' to encourage prisoners of war to express their views directly to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its subordinate organizations. This would provide conclusive evidence of their own feelings and wishes."

25. The Chairman replied to General Clark on October 7, 1953, with a letter unanimously adopted by the Commission. The following are relevant excerpts from that letter:
   "Your letter has made the differences in the views of the United Nations Command and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the issue very clear, and it seems that the differences are still quite fundamental. You said: 'The decisions and activities of your Commission, up to this point, seem to be based on the assumption that all the prisoners of war under your custody are truly desirous of repatriation.' The Commission has never made such an assumption. On the other hand, the Commission is not prepared to accept the following as a fait accompli: 'The prisoners of war of Korean and Chinese nationality made their choices several months ago, and without the use of force or coercion, the majority of them will adhere to their decisions.' This is indeed the position of the United Nations Command. On the other hand, the position of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers is that these prisoners of war have not had the opportunity to express their free will because there are tightly organized groups in the prisoner of war camps, which are said to intimidate those who wish to be repatriated. The Commission is not prepared to work on the basis of any of these assumptions. The Commission has no prejudice and is eager to ensure that prisoners of war have the complete freedom to choose without coercion or threat. If it is assumed that 'the majority of them will adhere to their decisions,' how can the Commission discover a small number of people who might change their minds? It is precisely for this purpose that the headquarters of both sides agreed to include 'explanations' in the terms of the agreement. This is a mandatory provision. And the Commission must provide the necessary freedom and convenience for the interpreters in accordance with the 'Scope of Authority.' The Commission has the obligation to protect prisoners of war from the use of force or the threat of force, and it also has the same obligation to ensure that the Commission carries out the legal duties entrusted to it by the 'Scope of Authority.'
   It is possible that many prisoners of war will not request repatriation. However, up to now, approximately 110 prisoners of war have requested repatriation. This proves that at least some prisoners of war are truly desirous of repatriation. A more important fact is that no prisoner of war in the camp dares to publicly request repatriation. They must do so secretly, either risking being beaten to death or injured by other prisoners of war, or risking being shot to death by armed guards on the barbed wire. The abnormal manner in which prisoners of war express their wishes naturally raises doubts about the freedom of all prisoners of war. In such a situation, I hope you will understand why the Commission cannot 'fully recognize that the prisoners of war of Korean and Chinese nationality made their choices several months ago, and without the use of force or coercion, the majority of them will adhere to their decisions.' The Commission will, of course, ensure that there will be no use of force or coercion during the explanations. But the Commission cannot convince itself that the prisoners of war are not subject to some form of force or threat of force from other prisoners of war.
   You suggested that prisoners of war should be encouraged to express their views directly to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission or its subordinate organizations to dispel all doubts about the true attitudes of the prisoners of war. In my conversations with the leaders of the prisoners of war, I did ask them if they were willing to come to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to express their views, but they were not even willing to agree to this. Obviously, these leaders do not trust the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, or they are afraid that if a prisoner of war is allowed to be alone, he might change his mind and decide to request repatriation. Therefore, the method you suggested for understanding the attitudes of the prisoners of war is not feasible for us." (See Appendix 6)

26. The Commission could not fail to note that General Mark W. Clark did not mention the obligation stipulated in Article 3, Paragraph 8 of the "Scope of Authority" in his letter. The procedure proposed based on Article 9 cannot be considered a substitute for the provisions of Article 8.

27. The Commission also noted that the views of the United Nations Command were in line with the views of the prisoners of war "representatives." These prisoners of war "representatives" continued to express hostility towards the conduct of explanations. In this situation, the majority of the Commission believed it was appropriate to seek the help of the United Nations Command to inform the prisoners of war of the Commission's correct view on the obligation of prisoners of war to listen to explanations (Note 1). The United Nations Command was willing to issue a statement to the prisoners of war it had previously detained, providing an opportunity (see Appendix 7). For the above purpose, the Commission submitted a draft statement to be issued to the prisoners of war. This statement was to be issued under the authority of the Commission in the name of the United Nations Command. The statement is listed in Appendix 7, but the United Nations Command did not agree to the Commission's request.

   [Note 1] The Czechoslovakian and Polish members of the Commission, contrary to the majority opinion, advocated that any approach by the original detaining side to the prisoners of war who had been handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody was contrary to the "Scope of Authority."

**Chapter Two: Technical Arrangements for Explanations**

28. The facilities for conducting explanations were constructed by both sides at their own chosen locations without the agreement of the Commission, although the Indian guard troops had been previously informed and approved. The southern camp explanation area required large-scale construction due to the number of prisoners of war, and the plan was approved by the Indian guard troops on September 14, 1953. The Commission believed that before approving these facilities, both sides should have been given the opportunity to inspect the facilities and, if they had any opinions, to submit them to the Commission.

29. Representatives of both sides were escorted to the respective explanation sites on September 26, 1953. Both sides expressed dissatisfaction with the location, design, and layout of these facilities. Both sides also submitted their own designs to the Commission and suggested locations.

30. The Commission concluded that the criticisms raised by both sides were reasonable, and from the point of view of implementing the relevant part of the "Scope of Authority" concerning explanations, the locations where the explanation facilities were built within the prisoner of war camps were also unsatisfactory. On September 28, the Commission sent requirements for the design and location to both sides and requested that they be constructed as soon as possible. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers agreed to make the necessary changes to the explanation facilities in the northern camp, but the United Nations Command stated that they could not do so in the short term because, according to the United Nations Command, the suggested locations were mined and were not suitable for construction. The United Nations Command also cited the lack of engineering personnel, materials, and labor as reasons.

31. Based on the United Nations Command's statement about the existence of mines and their estimate of the time required to clear the area, the Commission felt that it could not be held responsible for delaying the start of the explanation work. Therefore, the Commission suggested that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as long as the existing facilities could be appropriately modified and expanded according to their proposed design, should conduct explanations in the existing facilities in the southern camp. The Commission passed a resolution to this effect. The Czechoslovakian and Polish members opposed this resolution, arguing that the Commission had not adequately considered the attitude of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers before taking hasty action, and that the passage of this resolution was contrary to the "Scope of Authority" - the "Scope of Authority" had imposed on the Commission the obligation to provide both sides with freedom and convenience.

32. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers stated that the United Nations Command's statement about the existence of mines was untrue and violated the statement made by Brigadier General Bryan on September 16 at the Military Armistice Commission. In this statement, Brigadier General Bryan had guaranteed that there were no mines or other dangerous objects in the demilitarized zone under the control of the United Nations Command. After this fact was brought to the attention of the Commission, the Commission felt that the previous decision to use the facilities already built by the United Nations Command was inappropriate.

33. On October 1, 1953, the Commission pointed out the location for the construction of a new explanation area to the United Nations Command, and on October 2, the Chairman requested the United Nations Command to estimate the time required to complete the facilities according to the design proposed by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers at the new location. The United Nations Command did not express a willingness to build the proposed facilities but replied on October 3: it was estimated that it would take one week to complete a temporary area of twenty tents, the first permanent area would take twenty days to complete, and the second permanent area would take thirty days. Before starting the construction work, the United Nations Command needed a definite requirement. The Chairman formally made this requirement in his letter of October 5. In this letter, he said that the Commission was confident that the United Nations Command could complete the construction in much less time than estimated. The United Nations Command replied on October 7 that the estimate remained the same as before.

34. The Commission could not agree with the time estimated by the United Nations Command. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers had already given specific assurances that they could complete the facilities according to their proposed design within four days. The United Nations Command finally reduced the construction time by more than half and completed the construction work on October 14, 1953. The relevant correspondence between the Commission and both sides on the issue of constructing explanation facilities and other related matters (such as the construction of certain roads) is listed in Appendix 8.

35. In retrospect and based on the Commission's experience in conducting explanation work in the southern camp, the Commission necessarily supports the view that the original explanation facilities built by the United Nations Command would have been completely unsuitable. These facilities were too cramped in space, and it would have been impossible to conduct explanations without being seriously disrupted by the noise and violence of the prisoners of war.

36. Due to the delay in the construction of the explanation facilities and the consequent delay in the start date of the explanations, the Commission requested the United Nations Command and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to agree to an extension and to extend the explanation time by five days. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers agreed to both suggestions made by the Commission; the United Nations Command, while agreeing to the extension, was not willing to agree to any extension of time.

37. In view of the further delay in the start date of the explanation work, the Commission sent another letter to the United Nations Command on September 28, 1953, inquiring whether the United Nations Command was willing to reconsider its decision on extending the time. The relevant communications on this issue are listed in Appendix 9.

**Part Three: The Start of Explanations**

**Chapter One: Explanations in the Southern Camp**

38. On October 13, 1953, the Commission notified the United Nations Command that the Commission was ready to actually begin explanations in the northern camp on October 15, 1953, and also sent a similar notification to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. On October 14, 1953, the United Nations Command replied that they did not wish to begin their explanations on October 15, 1953, and stated that they would inform the Commission's secretariat of their wishes regarding this matter. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in accordance with the procedural rules for explanations, Paragraph 23, notified the Commission's secretariat of their plans (Note 1). They requested that 1,000 Chinese People's Volunteers who had been captured be brought out from camps 28 and 31 to listen to explanations, and they also requested the convenience of broadcasting certain letters to all the prisoners of war in the camps.

   [Note 1] Before the start of the explanations, the representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers had requested that explanations be given to the prisoners of war of Korean and Chinese nationality simultaneously every day. They said that since the Chinese and Korean peoples had fought together, they considered it of great importance to conduct explanations in the manner they requested. They also requested that the prisoners of war of these two nationalities be divided into small groups from many camps. After pointing out the practical difficulties of bringing prisoners of war out from several camps, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers agreed to conduct explanations to the prisoners of war belonging to one camp and did not insist on their request to conduct explanations to the prisoners of war of Korean and Chinese nationality on the same day.

39. The commander of the guard troops received the request and made arrangements according to the plan proposed by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. However, the commander reported that the "representatives" of these camps had stated that unless the prisoners of war had the opportunity to discuss certain issues with the United Nations press and the Commission, they were not willing to come out to listen to explanations. Because the Commission hoped that these prisoners of war could be brought out to listen to explanations as peacefully as possible, the Commission agreed to meet with these "representatives." Although the Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the Commission expressed doubts about the representativeness and sincerity of these people.

40. On the morning of October 15, 1953, the Commission received the "representatives" of the Chinese prisoners of war in various camps. The prisoners of war were assured that they would not be subjected to any coercion in their free choice of whether to be repatriated, and those who did not wish to be repatriated were also assured that they could be returned to their original camps. Despite these assurances, the relevant "representatives" still expressed their unwillingness to immediately enter the explanation area and generally showed a lack of sincerity. Therefore, the guard troops were ordered to surround the camp and to demand that the prisoners of war come out of their camps. The prisoners of war finally agreed to come out to listen to explanations.

41. On October 16, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers' explanation plan requested that the prisoners of war from camps 34 and 48 be brought out, but the "representatives" of the Korean prisoners of war flatly refused to come out to listen to explanations. The Commission, which was present to observe the work on the spot, carefully considered the situation created by this refusal.

42. The commander of the Indian guard troops had reported the situation described in paragraph 41 to the Commission. He said that he proposed to send his soldiers into the camp, tent by tent, to bring out the people, and proposed that if the prisoners of war in that tent or other tents attacked his soldiers during this process, the Commission should allow them to open fire. The Commission unanimously believed that although the Commission should not advise the commander of the Indian guard troops, within the scope of the Chairman's instructions, the commander could act freely when he considered it appropriate. The Chairman's instructions were: except for
   (1) self-defense, that is, when the prisoners of war attack the guard troops, and
   (2) when there is an attempt to escape en masse, weapons should not be used to bring out prisoners of war from the camp (Note 1).

   [Note 1] The issue of using force to bring out prisoners of war to listen to explanations was first raised by the Chairman at the Commission's 31st meeting on October 14, 1953. Although he explicitly stated that he was not in favor of using force in principle, he said that if the prisoners of war attacked the guard troops or attempted to escape, some use of force would be inevitable. The Swedish member said that, in principle, he was opposed to the use of force except in cases of collective escape or self-defense, and he was not yet sure about the use of tear gas, saying that if force had to be used, it should be used as a last resort. The Swiss member said that the "Scope of Authority" Article 3 prohibited the use of force, and therefore, except for self-defense, force should not be used, and the use of tear gas could be considered. The Czechoslovakian and Polish members said that if persuasive methods were ineffective, there was no other way to "contact all the prisoners of war" except to use force. They also said that in order to bring the prisoners of war to the interpreters, the use of force was inevitable according to the "Scope of Authority," and said that the extent and timing of the use of force were entirely up to the Indian guard troops to decide.

43. After issuing these instructions, the commander of the Indian guard troops reported to the Chairman that the situation in the Korean camp and its surrounding camps had become so tense and dangerous that the commander felt that a new situation had arisen. In this new situation, if he attempted to force the prisoners of war to leave the camp, it would likely result in large-scale casualties. He submitted this matter to the Commission, saying that he estimated that if force were used, there would probably be about 300 to 400 casualties. In this situation, the commander of the guard troops requested the Commission to give clear instructions on whether he should proceed with the work despite these casualties.

44. The Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the Commission said that the commander of the guard troops had already received clear instructions, and the Commission should not discuss purely military steps. They further stated that the guard troops should act in accordance with the unanimous instructions previously given to them by the Commission.

45. The Swedish and Swiss members of the Commission felt that although a decision had previously been made to bring out the prisoners of war to listen to explanations, a new situation had arisen before the Commission. They also felt that the commander of the Indian guard troops had the right to obtain a new decision on this fundamentally important issue. They stated that before making their final decision, they would submit this matter to their governments because they were not prepared to agree to any decision involving casualties among the prisoners of war.

46. As an executive, the Chairman of the Commission felt that in such an important matter, the commander of the guard troops had the right to obtain the unanimous support of the Commission, and since the Commission as a whole was the principal, it must be prepared to support its executive and bear all the consequences of the use of force. Since the Commission could not reach any unanimous decision, the commander of the Indian guard troops stopped and abandoned the attempt to use force to bring out the Korean prisoners of war from the camps.

**Chapter Two**

47. The events of October 16, 1953, raised a fundamental and important issue for the Commission, namely, the use of force to compel prisoners of war to attend explanations. The dilemma created by this issue is one that can never be resolved. The disagreement on this issue has hindered the work of the Commission in many ways, and it is important to elaborate on the various different views on this issue.

48. The views of the Swedish and Swiss members on this issue were: the wording and spirit of the "Scope of Authority" and the Geneva Convention are both prohibitive of the use of force against prisoners of war, and therefore, except for purely disciplinary measures, they opposed any action by the Commission to use force against prisoners of war.

49. The Czechoslovakian and Polish members argued: according to the provisions of Article 1 of the "Scope of Authority," the Commission exists "to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated." Articles 8 and 10 of the "Scope of Authority" specifically stipulate that within the scope of the rights of prisoners of war as stipulated in Article 3, they should be able to exercise their rights. The Commission has the responsibility to ensure that the countries to which all prisoners of war belong have "freedom and convenience" to explain "their rights, etc." to all prisoners of war. The Commission currently has sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that there are prisoners of war who are in a state of terror and are prevented from exercising their right to be repatriated by the use of force. In this situation, one of the most important duties and responsibilities of the Commission is to ensure that the situation in the camp is improved so that prisoners of war are free from any fear. If it is deemed necessary in the performance of these duties and responsibilities, the use of force is permissible and is also permitted by the provisions of Article 7 of the "Scope of Authority."

50. The Indian delegation believed that the delegation could not accept the view that the prisoners of war had already made up their minds, which was contrary to the facts. Accepting such a view would negate the basis for the existence of the Commission. The Commission was entrusted with the responsibility of helping to ascertain the true intentions of the prisoners of war regarding repatriation in accordance with the "Scope of Authority." Managing the explanation work is one of the basic and primary duties of the Commission and is one of the most important responsibilities. The resistance of the prisoners of war to the Commission's performance of these duties and responsibilities is illegal under the "Scope of Authority" and the procedural rules. Therefore, the use of force to overcome this resistance is permissible.

Title: The Indian Delegation Believes "Scope of Authority" Does Not Hinder the Use of Force

Xinhua News Agency, December 31, 1953

The Indian delegation felt that the "Scope of Authority" did not hinder the use of force. The seventh clause clearly stipulates that for the performance of the duties and responsibilities of this committee, such use of force is permissible. The Indian delegation also believed that providing the interpreters with the freedom and convenience to explain to all prisoners of war was the most important responsibility of this committee. However, when the use of force might cause significant casualties among the prisoners of war, the Indian delegation felt that the committee should give its executors a unanimous authorization and support. Any responsibility for causing significant casualties should be shared by the members of this committee. The members of this committee must be prepared to bear the consequences arising from such use of force. Obviously, the committee lacks such support, and the Swiss member of the committee declared: if force is used to compel prisoners of war to attend the explanations, his government might have to consider whether to continue participating in the work of this committee.

The Czech and Polish members of the committee insisted: the eleventh clause of the "Scope of Authority" requires the committee to act according to the majority's decision, so there is no need for unanimous agreement on the use of force, and seeking such unanimity is contrary to the "Scope of Authority."

In the circumstances detailed in the fifty-first paragraph, the committee had to abandon the use of force to bring prisoners of war out for explanations. The remaining methods available to the committee's executors were only persuasion. The Polish and Czech members of the committee opposed meeting with these "representatives" to persuade them, stating that these "representatives" were specially sent spies to sabotage the explanation work. These "representatives" did not represent the prisoners of war, and their main strength was used to obstruct the prisoners of war from exercising their right to repatriation, even using force, threats, and violence to prevent them.

The committee had considered the issue of isolating the so-called "spies" on more than one occasion. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers submitted a list of those they claimed were "spies" to the committee. Regarding the term "spies" used to refer to "non-prisoners of war," the majority of the committee members believed that the prisoners of war handed over for custody did not belong to this category but were genuine prisoners of war. They could not imagine that just because some names appeared on the list provided by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, such named prisoners of war should be isolated. Only those prisoners of war who were caught committing indiscipline or other punishable offenses could be isolated. The committee could only isolate those prisoners of war who were caught committing indiscipline or punishable offenses. A few had already been isolated in this manner, but their number was very small. In any case, such isolation was far from breaking up and reorganizing the current prisoner of war camps. Because it was not possible to reorganize these prisoner of war camps and isolate the so-called "spies," the committee felt that perhaps the best way to ensure that prisoners of war could make free and unconstrained choices was to bring them out individually for explanations, at which time they would have the opportunity to make decisions.

The Czech and Polish members of the committee demanded the isolation of these prisoners of war and suggested that even if their isolation was not treated as a punitive measure, it should at least be treated as an administrative measure within the scope of custody. They also proposed that according to the first, second, third, and fifth clauses of the "Explanation and Visitation Work Regulations," punitive measures should be taken to stop the spies from obstructing the explanation work. They believed that tolerating the violence and terror of the spies would make it impossible for the committee to carry out its work.

Chapter III

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in accordance with the twenty-third clause of the "Explanation and Visitation Work Regulations," submitted their plan for explanations on the morning of October 16 at 10:00 AM, requesting that one thousand Chinese prisoners of war from certain designated camps be brought out for individual explanations. Given that their plan for October 16 was not implemented (see paragraphs thirty-eight to forty-six), the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers requested efforts to bring out Korean prisoners of war again and requested that their plan for October 17 be modified accordingly.

The chairman of the committee expressed his opinion to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers and requested that they not change their submitted plan for October 17. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers finally agreed to do so. Because these discussions took some time, no explanation work was conducted in the morning of October 17, resulting in explanations being conducted in only one camp with approximately five hundred Chinese prisoners of war on that day.

On October 18, 1953, the Secretariat of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission received from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers a plan for explanation work on October 19, requesting that one thousand Korean prisoners of war be brought out from the forty-eighth and thirty-fourth camps. Since the Indian custody troops could not bring out the Korean prisoners of war for explanations but could bring out the Chinese prisoners of war for explanations, they expressed to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers that they took into account the difficulties of the committee and perhaps could consider conducting explanations to the Chinese prisoners of war before the Korean prisoners of war were persuaded to come out for explanations.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers felt that they could not accept this suggestion and reiterated their demand for the Korean prisoners of war to come out. The Korean and Chinese sides stated in their letter of October 18, 1953:

"Facts have proven that the difficulties in arranging for prisoners of war to listen to explanations were created by the Chiang and Li spies under the instigation of the original detaining side. Overcoming these difficulties requires taking some practical and effective measures. If one yields to these difficulties, it not only violates the 'Scope of Authority' and the work regulations but also encourages these spies to sabotage the explanation work, making it impossible for the Indian custody troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to complete their tasks." The committee considered this situation.

The majority opinion held by the Indian, Swedish, and Swiss members was that the committee was the highest authority to approve the plans submitted by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The work regulations twenty-third clause only grants them the right to submit plans, while acceptance or rejection should be decided by the committee. When the committee reviews any plan submitted to it, it must consider whether the plan is feasible. The twenty-third clause did not stipulate that the committee had the obligation to execute the plans submitted by the explanation representatives without modification. The committee had the right to reject or modify such plans on the grounds of convenience or feasibility. As for the seventh clause, it only stipulated the right to conduct individual or collective explanations to prisoners of war, but did not stipulate the right to specify which individuals or which groups of individuals.

The minority opinion held by the Czech and Polish members in the committee was that the eighth clause of the "Scope of Authority" granted the explanation side the right to explain to all prisoners of war. The seventh and twenty-third clauses of the explanation work regulations affirmed this right. Since the explanation representatives had the right to explain to all prisoners of war, the committee could not order them to explain to certain specific categories of prisoners of war. The "Scope of Authority" did not authorize the committee to control or alter the procedure of explanations, as long as this procedure did not violate any specific provisions in the "Scope of Authority." The committee could not use the argument of "feasibility." Because bringing out the Korean prisoners of war was completely "feasible," if there were any infeasibility, it was entirely the fault of the committee. Because the committee abandoned its authority, refused to break up the prisoner of war organizations, and isolate the "spies" and "ringleaders." Finally, since this "infeasibility" was the result of the committee not doing what it should do and doing what it should not do, the committee could not use "infeasibility" as an excuse. Therefore, the committee could not restrict the rights of the explanation side, and any such restriction, since it was contrary to the "Scope of Authority," was naturally illegal.

The Polish and Czech members expressed that if the committee insisted on acting according to this majority opinion, they would not participate in the committee's meetings. This majority opinion, in their view, seriously violated the "Scope of Authority." When a draft letter (see Annex 10) was put to a vote, they withdrew from the meeting, and thus the committee was unable to formally notify the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers that the committee could not arrange for the Korean prisoners of war to be brought out for explanations and again requested that side to consider continuing to explain to the Chinese prisoners of war. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continued to insist on explaining to the Korean prisoners of war. The Indian custody troops failed to persuade the Korean prisoners of war "representatives" to come out for explanations. Under these circumstances, no explanations were conducted from October 18 to 30, 1953. However, on October 31, explanations were resumed because the Korean prisoners of war "representatives" were finally persuaded to leave their camps.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers insisted on explaining to the Korean prisoners of war based on their argument that they had the right to explain to all prisoners of war, and the committee could not restrict this right, but only request them to explain to a group of prisoners of war, namely the Chinese prisoners of war. However, that side was prepared to make some concessions on the number of prisoners of war to be explained. They said they were prepared to agree to bring out five hundred Korean prisoners of war instead of one thousand and not to specify which camp they came from (see Annex 11).

It seemed that the Korean prisoners of war's refusal to listen to explanations was related to the hostile attitude taken by certain relevant parties outside the prisoner of war camps at that time. See the ninety-eighth paragraph and Annex 17 of this report.

The next day, November 1, explanations could not be conducted again. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers requested in their plan for that day to be given the convenience to broadcast to the two hundred fifty prisoners of war in the waiting camps and the explanation areas while conducting individual explanations. The commander of the custody troops believed that such broadcasts would inevitably cause excitement among the prisoners of war and might lead to disturbances, and since the reserve forces of the Indian custody troops had all been used in the individual explanation work, they would not be able to handle such disturbances. In view of this warning, the chairman of the committee notified the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers that unless they agreed not to broadcast to the prisoners of war, individual explanations could not be conducted. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers did not agree to this suggestion. Therefore, the explanations on November 1 had to be stopped again.

To eliminate the difficulties mentioned in the previous paragraph, the chairman of the committee suggested to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers that broadcasts should only be made to the prisoners of war in the waiting tents and only after the broadcasts were completed should individual explanations begin. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers accepted this suggestion, and thus the explanation work was resumed on November 3 and continued for three days on November 3, 4, and 5.

On November 4, the committee faced a new problem. According to the request of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, four hundred three Chinese prisoners of war were brought out for explanations on November 4. Of these, two hundred five had been explained, and the remaining unexplained were sent back to the camp they came from. Due to the lack of additional camps to isolate the "explained" and "unexplained" prisoners of war, they were sent back mixed together to the camp they came from.

On November 5, of the four hundred eight Chinese prisoners of war from the twenty-second camp, only one hundred thirty-six had been explained, and the "explained" and "unexplained" prisoners of war could not be isolated again.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers protested on November 4 and 5 about the failure to isolate the prisoners of war. They claimed that the twenty-third clause of the explanation work regulations clearly stipulated the obligation to isolate prisoners of war in the manner prescribed by the explanation work regulations. They also notified the committee that the explanations for all the prisoners of war brought out on November 5 might not be completed and requested the Indian custody troops to make arrangements to isolate the remaining unexplained prisoners of war. This request could not be executed due to the reasons stated in paragraph sixty-three. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, while protesting the violation of the work regulations twenty-third clause, requested on November 6 to explain to the remaining unexplained prisoners of war. The prisoners of war "representatives" did not heed persuasion and refused to come out. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continued to request explanations to their remaining unexplained prisoners of war until November 15, and no explanation work was conducted from November 6 to November 16.

On November 14, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, while reserving their right to request explanations to the prisoners of war in the twenty-second camp, agreed to explain to another camp. Therefore, the explanation work was resumed on November 16. On that day, four hundred seven Korean prisoners of war from the fifty-third camp had been brought out for explanations, but only two hundred twenty-seven had been explained. The isolation issue arose again. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers hoped to isolate the remaining unexplained prisoners of war and bring them out on November 17. The Indian custody troops could not do so. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continued to insist on isolation and stopped submitting their explanation plans, and thus the explanation work in the south camp was interrupted again. However, the explanation work was resumed on December 21, 1953.

The interruption of the explanation work in the south camp led to correspondence between the committee and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers (see Annex 12). The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers expressed dissatisfaction with the conditions under which their representatives conducted the explanation work. These conditions were not perfect and were a stark contrast to the conditions in the north camp, where the explanation work was conducted without any interference or violence.

The committee could not guarantee that the prisoners of war in the south camp would have perfect order. The majority opinion of the committee on the behavior of the prisoners of war and other matters was explained in the committee's letter of November 18, 1953 (see Annex 12).

In the days of conducting explanations, the committee saw that the behavior of the prisoners of war in the explanation tents was of a consistent type. The prisoners of war were quiet and normal during the process of entering the explanation tents, but inside the tents, most of them became rude and shouted the same slogans. The custody troops had to use three unarmed personnel in each explanation tent to ensure order and discipline. However, these personnel could not stop the prisoners of war from shouting. The only exceptions were those who sought repatriation or those who did not shout but engaged in political debates with the explanation representatives among the non-repatriation prisoners, and these two categories were in the minority.

As for those who sought repatriation, except for two, they all sought repatriation immediately after entering the explanation tent. This strongly confirmed the committee's view that those prisoners of war who were willing to be repatriated were coerced and forcibly detained in the prisoner of war camps, and in their camps, they could not exercise their right to repatriation.

There were several examples where the relevant prisoners took a considerable amount of time to make their decisions. In one example, a prisoner seemed to be in a state of fear and extreme hesitation, so the explanation representatives continued their explanations. Finally, the chairman of the committee intervened, took the prisoner away, and isolated him so that he could have time to calmly consider his decision. The relevant prisoner decided to choose repatriation when he was alone. He was examined by the committee and proved in the committee that he was filled with such fear that although he longed to return home, he could not get rid of that fear, and after being isolated, he immediately felt more at ease. This prisoner's incident became the subject of protests from the United Nations forces, and the relevant letters on this issue are listed in Annex 13. Another prisoner who sought repatriation after a long explanation also seemed to show signs of fear.

The committee could not estimate the number of prisoners of war who did not exercise their right to repatriation due to fear of the consequences that might occur. Similarly, it could not be said that all those who did not seek repatriation did so voluntarily, and not due to some fears instilled in their minds over a long period.

In the process of adopting the twenty-third clause of the explanation work regulations, the committee unanimously acknowledged the necessity of separately managing the three categories of prisoners of war mentioned therein. However, it was anticipated that there would be some practical difficulties in implementing this provision.

Since the committee did not have empty camps available for use, there were two ways to proceed: to guarantee the construction of another set of identical camps or to conduct explanations camp by camp or in batches of several camps. The latter method was simpler because it would not require the large-scale construction that would take a long time to complete. Due to the delay in the start of explanations and the difficulties encountered in the construction of explanation facilities, the chairman of the committee, considering the responsibilities borne by the committee's executors, made specific reservations regarding the manner of implementing the twenty-third clause of the explanation work regulations. According to this reservation, explanations should be conducted for the entire camp or several camps until some camps became empty due to the repatriation of prisoners of war. It was thought that the repatriation rate might be such that after about five thousand prisoners of war had been explained, there would be camps available for use, making it possible to conduct explanations to smaller batches of prisoners of war and to manage them separately. In making this reservation, an important factor was to avoid the necessity for the Indian custody troops to bear the additional burden of increasing the number of camps.

Therefore, the twenty-third clause was based on certain assumptions contained in the reservations made by the chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. These reservations were equally related to the twenty-third clause, which was closely related to the twenty-third clause.

On November 4 and 5, the factors related to the chairman's reservations still existed. However, to find a way out of this situation, the chairman, in his letter of November 6, 1953, to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, made the following suggestion (see Annex 12): "Now, since you seem to have greatly slowed down the individual explanations, the Indian custody troops have encountered a problem of finding surplus camps to isolate the explained prisoners of war and the unexplained prisoners of war. There are no ready surplus camps available for this purpose, and the commander of the Indian custody troops does not have the troops to manage any more camps and to guarantee the security of such increased camps and the prisoners of war within them. However, we are always eager to satisfy your wishes to the best of our ability. Therefore, although there are difficulties in manpower, I am prepared to establish an additional camp to deal with this possible situation. I hope you recognize that it is impossible to establish any more camps and to fully guard them. If you agree to this approach, we will proceed as quickly as possible within the practical range to modify a camp."

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in their letter of November 7, 1953, expressed their agreement with the chairman's suggestion with the following words (see Annex 12): "To quickly solve the problem of separately managing prisoners of war, it is completely necessary to establish some additional camps for the isolation of prisoners of war. Although we believe that there is no such necessity according to the 'Scope of Authority' and the work regulations, in consideration of the actual difficulties of the Indian custody troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, we agree that after completing the explanations to all the prisoners of war in a camp over several consecutive days, explanations can be conducted to the prisoners of war in another camp."

The promise made by the chairman of the committee to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers could not be realized due to the attitude taken by the prisoners of war "representatives." They said that if the prisoners of war were isolated, the prisoners of war would not come out. The prisoners of war "representatives" had no reason for their refusal, because isolating the prisoners of war was in accordance with the work regulations. However, they refused because they clearly stated their fear that breaking up the prisoner of war camps would lead to the disintegration of the camp organizations and thus weaken the influence of these "representatives" over most of the prisoners of war.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continued to insist on their request that the committee should make arrangements for the isolation of prisoners of war. With the start of explanations in the north camp, where the relevant prisoners of war had agreed to isolation, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers strengthened their demands for isolation arrangements, arguing that the lack of such facilities in the south camp was equivalent to creating an "unfair situation" for them. The chairman of the committee explained the situation in his letter of December 6, 1953, as follows:

"The failure to isolate the prisoners of war is not due to the committee's unwillingness to do so, and the committee has no intention of violating the principle of strict equality between the two sides. In the current situation, the impossibility of isolation is completely due to the prisoners of war 'representatives' refusing to leave the camp--if they are isolated."

Lieutenant General Ri Sang-chol, in his letter of December 8, 1953, to the chairman of the committee, again requested the construction of isolation facilities, and the relevant part of the letter is excerpted as follows: "Isolating the explained and unexplained prisoners of war is a clear regulation of the 'Explanation and Visitation Work Regulations.' You clearly agreed in your letter of November 6 to construct isolation camps in the Dongchang prisoner of war camp. The work regulations must be executed, and promises must be kept. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custody troops have no reason not to execute the regulations of the work regulations and your clear promise in the Dongchang prisoner of war camp. You said in your letters of November 18 and December 6 that the failure to conduct isolation was completely due to the prisoners of war 'representatives' refusing to leave the camp if they were to be isolated. We completely disagree with this. Ironclad facts prove that the so-called prisoners of war 'representatives' in the Dongchang prisoner of war camp are the spies appointed by the United Nations forces, they are the persecutors and murderers of our captured personnel, they are the saboteurs of the explanation work, they absolutely cannot represent the prisoners of war. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custody troops have failed to eliminate the spies and break up the spy organizations, but instead recognize the spies as prisoners of war 'representatives,' take the will of the spies as the will of the prisoners of war, and refuse to make isolation arrangements. This cannot but make us feel deeply indignant. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has never seriously made any isolation arrangements, how can it be known that isolation arrangements cannot be carried out? The situation of listening to the words of the spies and causing the explanation work of our side to stop is unacceptable.

I firmly request the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custody troops to construct isolation camps and make all necessary isolation arrangements, and to take decisive measures in accordance with the 'Scope of Authority' and the work regulations to execute them, so that the explanation work of our side can proceed."

The isolation arrangements were finally completed through the adjustment of the custody troops' living facilities. On December 10, 1953, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers received notification of these arrangements.

On December 11, 1953, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers submitted a plan for explanations to two hundred fifty Korean prisoners of war in the fifty-third camp on December 12, 1953. The relevant prisoners of war "representatives" refused to leave the camp to listen to the explanations, and thus the explanations could not be conducted. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continued to submit their plans for explanations to the two hundred fifty Korean prisoners of war in the fifty-third camp, and the camp "representatives" maintained their attitude. Then, on December 18, 1953, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers requested the provision of two hundred fifty prisoners of war from the thirty-eighth camp, and the relevant camp "representatives" again refused to come out for explanations. However, on December 20, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, while reserving their right to conduct explanations in the camps they had previously requested, requested the provision of two hundred fifty Chinese prisoners of war from the third camp. The "representatives" of this camp agreed to come out for explanations and agreed to isolation, and thus the explanation work was resumed in the south camp on December 21. The remaining prisoners of war in this camp were explained on December 22, and two hundred thirty-four Chinese prisoners of war in the fourth camp were explained on December 23 (see Annex 20).

Chapter VI: Explanation Work in the North Camp

On December 1, 1953, the United Nations forces notified the committee that the Republic of Korea was willing to actually begin explanations to the prisoners of war under its jurisdiction starting from December 2, 1953, and thus the explanation work in the north camp began. The United Nations forces requested the provision of thirty Korean prisoners of war each day, and the explanation work proceeded smoothly without interruption until December 11. The relevant Korean prisoners of war insisted on asking detailed questions of the explanation representatives on that day and demanded answers to their questions. However, the explanation representatives expressed their unwillingness to continue explaining to these prisoners of war who were making numerous objections, and thus the chairman of the subsidiary organization ordered the prisoners of war to leave the explanation tent. The prisoners of war did not obey the orders given to them, and after some time, they had to be forcibly removed. Under these circumstances, only five of the thirty Korean prisoners of war received explanations on December 11.

On December 11, the Korean prisoners of war in the north camp submitted a lengthy memorandum to the committee to express their dissatisfaction. An American prisoner of war and an English prisoner of war submitted similar petitions to support the petition of the Korean prisoners of war, stating that they would not be prepared to come out for explanations until the committee considered the petition of their Korean friends.

Since the petition of the Korean prisoners of war was written in Korean and was several pages long, it took some time to translate, and thus the petition could not be considered immediately. Due to this reason, the committee did not consider these petitions until December 22. A formal reply was given to the petition of the American prisoners of war as shown in Annex 14. The chairman of the committee notified the American and Korean prisoners of war of his position on the evening of December 22, but those prisoners of war refused to come out for explanations. However, the United Nations forces conducted a broadcast to these people on December 23.

Under these circumstances, the north camp could no longer conduct explanations. The majority opinion of the committee believed that the prisoners of war's refusal to come out for explanations based on the reasons they stated was untenable. The letters related to the north camp explanation issue are listed in Annex 15.

Part IV

Chapter 1: The Organization of Prisoners of War in the South Camp

The existence of organizations in the prisoner of war camps has been mentioned in the eleventh paragraph of this report. Now, a more detailed explanation of this issue is intended. Without a more adequate understanding of the nature, objectives, and branch organizations of the prisoners of war organizations, it is impossible to provide a comprehensive account of the situation faced by the committee and the difficulties encountered by the committee in its efforts to fulfill the "Scope of Authority."

The committee recognized the existence of prisoners of war organizations in its earliest stages of work. In the news release issued on October 2, 1953, all members of the committee acknowledged that these organizations had become a problem. The relevant part of the news release is as follows:

"There is no doubt that the prisoners of war were perfectly organized into many groups when they were taken over, and this organizational form is still maintained in the camps. The leadership that existed among the prisoners of war before the Indian custody troops took over continues to exert its influence on the prisoners of war. These prisoners of war are under considerable pressure. In some cases, violence has been involved. This is the problem the committee is facing today." (see Annex 16)

As time passed, the committee obtained a considerable amount of material. Later, it could be seen more clearly that the prisoners of war organizations were complex and complete.

Annex 17 of this report contains several letters that were intercepted by the custody troops when they were sent in or out of the camps. These letters indicate the existence of a headquarters of the prisoners of war organizations and indicate that the headquarters is located in Seoul and is under the control of the commander of the Republic of Korea Military Police. This headquarters is connected with four branch organizations that control six prisoner of war compounds. The branch organizations control the camp organizations in all fifty-five camps. There is an effective communication system working between these three levels of organizations, and the United Nations 64th Field Hospital constitutes the most important link in this communication system.

In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the most interesting and noteworthy letter intercepted was found on a Korean prisoner of war who was arrested on November 8, 1953, when he attempted to enter the forty-eighth camp in the Wu camp. The committee is still investigating the circumstances of his escape and his attempt to re-enter the camp, but the fact remains that the letter was found on him. It has also been confirmed that he had escaped from the camp and attempted to re-enter the camp several days later, at which time he was arrested.

The objectives of these organizations are multifaceted. The committee acknowledges that those who have to live under the conditions of the prisoner of war camps must have some organizations established on a voluntary basis for entertainment or knowledge-seeking purposes. However, the committee has serious doubts about whether these organizations that the committee has to deal with are of this voluntary nature. The close and continuous interference from external forces confirms the committee's doubts. Indeed, the committee itself is under the threat and intimidation of the Republic of Korea, which further increases the committee's difficulties (see Annex 18).

In the prisoners of war organizations, the methods used by those in power are coercive. Violence has been used against those who wish to exercise their right to repatriation. On November 1, 1953, two prisoners of war were severely beaten in front of the committee's subsidiary organization because they expressed their desire for repatriation. The custody troops experienced great difficulties in rescuing these two Chinese prisoners of war alive from the twenty-eighth camp.

Several murders have occurred (see Annex 19). The efforts to investigate these cases have been met with protests from the prisoners of war "representatives." For each such investigation, the custody troops had to conduct a large-scale operation. On October 1, the prisoners in the hospital staged a violent demonstration, obstructing the committee's efforts to inspect the hospital. On November 21, the hospital patients staged another violent demonstration, obstructing the committee's efforts to investigate the alleged murder in the hospital.

The committee could not handle this situation without resorting to force, which is the last thing the committee would want to do. The situation in the prisoner of war camps is definitely unfavorable to the implementation of the third clause of the "Scope of Authority."

Part V: Conclusion

According to the first clause of the first paragraph of the "Scope of Authority," the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was established "to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation." The same clause of the third paragraph stipulates that "prisoners of war... shall not be subjected to force or the threat of force to obstruct or compel their repatriation, and shall not be subjected to violence or insult to their dignity or self-respect in any manner or for any purpose."

Since the prisoners of war did not enjoy the freedom to seek repatriation while they were in the camps and were under the threat of force or violence, the committee is convinced that explanations cannot be conducted in the manner specified in the eighth clause in "the place where these prisoners of war are detained." Organized disturbances and violent demonstrations would obstruct such work. The committee had to make additional regulations for the explanation work to implement the "Scope of Authority," especially the third and eighth clauses. The authority to make such additional regulations was derived from the eighth clause of the third paragraph of the "Scope of Authority." The most important regulation thus made was regarding the individual explanations to prisoners of war. The first to seventh clauses of the explanation work regulations were all aimed at creating conditions for the implementation of the "Scope of Authority."

Although the committee made every effort to create a suitable atmosphere for the conduct of the explanation work, the committee could not make a judgment that even in the south camp, the prisoners of war under its custody who had undergone individual explanations were completely free from the threat of force or violence from the prisoners of war organizations and their leaders, which were closely related to the prisoners of war organizations and their leaders. However, it must be stated that the majority opinion of the committee believed that under these circumstances and within the time and power available to the committee, the committee could not do more than provide the facilities for individual explanations. The Czech and Polish members of the committee said that this was not enough, and the camps must be reorganized and the ringleaders and the so-called "spies" isolated.

The committee could not make a judgment that the prisoners of war under its custody in the south camp were completely free from the influence of the previous detaining side, especially the authorities of the Republic of Korea. Their interference made it impossible for the committee to draw any other conclusion.

These activities, together with the activities of the prisoners of war organizations and their "representatives," did not help to create conditions for the prisoners of war to exercise their right to repatriation without restraint. These activities weakened the committee's custody and control and made it extremely difficult for the committee to establish the prisoners of war's freedom of choice at any time.

As for the north camp, the committee had no evidence to prove that the original detaining side had any activities regarding the prisoners of war in the camp. These prisoners of war were very disciplined, and the committee had no evidence to show the existence and nature and objectives of any organization. However, it can be stated here that the few prisoners of war in the north camp who chose repatriation escaped from the camp to request repatriation, and escaping from the camp was relatively easy.

The committee can also state that, in the committee's view, both sides had the right to conduct explanations for ninety days. The United Nations forces voluntarily decided not to conduct explanations throughout the entire period but began their explanation work on December 2. However, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers consistently insisted on having a full ninety-day period. They did not obtain such a period, and there were many interruptions, the causes of which have been described in paragraphs twenty-eight to eighty-one of this report.

The initial delay in the start of the explanation work was due to the committee's inability to complete the necessary facilities. Some interruptions in the explanation work were caused by the attitude taken by the Korean prisoners of war "representatives," and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continued to request explanations to these prisoners of war, which was the situation from October 18 to 30. Subsequently, from November 6 to 15 and from November 16 to December 20, there were also interruptions, which were caused by the prisoners of war "representatives" refusing isolation. When the "representatives" of the third and fourth camps of the Chinese prisoners of war agreed to come out for explanations, the explanations began again.

The committee must draw the attention of the United Nations forces and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to the existence of the situation that made it impossible to fully carry out the tasks of the committee in accordance with the "Scope of Authority." Annex 20 details the number of prisoners of war under the committee's custody on December 23, the number repatriated after explanations, and the number repatriated without such explanations.

According to the eleventh clause of the "Scope of Authority," the committee has an obligation to "after the expiration of the ninety-day period... the question of the disposition of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation shall be referred to the political conference... proposed to be convened by the draft agreement on the cessation of hostilities." Such a political conference has not yet been realized. Therefore, the committee could not refer the question of their disposition to the political conference and had to refer the entire question to both sides for consideration in accordance with the committee's report. At the same time, it should be considered how the eleventh clause of the "Scope of Authority" should be implemented, especially regarding the announcement of "any prisoner of war who has not exercised his right to repatriation within one hundred twenty days after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took charge of them and has not been agreed upon by the political conference for any other disposition... shall be released from his status as a prisoner of war and become a civilian."

The Czech and Polish members advocated that both sides had the right to enjoy the freedom and convenience of explaining to their respective prisoners of war during the entire ninety-day period stipulated in the "Scope of Authority," and advocated that in view of the fact that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers could only conduct explanations during a small part of the ninety-day period, the committee should make arrangements for the continuation and supplementation of their explanation work to make up for the entire ninety-day period.

Regarding the interim report of the first hundred and fourth paragraph, the Czech and Polish members made the following statement: "According to the 'Scope of Authority,' especially according to the interpretation of the twenty-fourth clause of the eleventh clause on the eleventh clause of the fourth clause, it is the responsibility of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The Czech and Polish representatives, when explaining their position on the issue of the ninety-day period stipulated in the 'Scope of Authority' for conducting explanations, reserve the right to require the committee to take further measures to implement the eleventh clause of the fourth clause of the 'Scope of Authority,' and to take appropriate measures in accordance with the interpretation of the 'Scope of Authority.'"

    中立国遣返委员会临时报告
    一九五三年十二月二十七日通过
    第一部分战俘看管的移交
    第一章
    一、中立国遣返委员会按照“职权范围”第一条第一款与第二条第四、五款的规定，于一九五三年九月十日开始接管未遣返的战俘。
    二、联合国军收容下的二二六零四名战俘的移交于一九五三年九月二十三日完成，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面也在一九五三年九月二十四日一天内完成了三五九名战俘的移交。
    三、战俘抵达南营时，表现了暴躁的脾气。这种脾气常常达到狂暴的程度。但印度看管部队却徒手地接收了他们，而未曾有过诉诸武力的情况。
    四、联合国军指称：战俘的暴乱行为系由于朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表的在场而引起的。这些代表共有五名，是按“职权范围”第一条第一款的规定每天同联合国军代表一起在场观察本委员会的工作的。
    五、联合国军指称：
    观察员的在场是违反“职权范围”的。哈利逊中将一九五三年九月十二日写给本委员会主席的信中称：
    “在非军事区内营中的不幸骚乱，其明显原因是由于能够被战俘认出来的共产党人员之在场。假如共产党代表不坚持到场，就很少有可能发生任何骚动。当我们草拟‘职权范围’时，我们手中的战俘还远在南朝鲜后方的营中。当时认为移交工作纯粹是一种单方面的工作，我们只是在已经建立并进行工作的营中把战俘交给印度部队。在我们的谈判过程中，没有在任何时候考虑过让另一方的人员观察这一工作。仅在九十天的解释期间，才允许对方的代表及观察员在营中出现。因此，根据停战谈判看来，在实地移交的期间任何一方的观察员都没有必要在场。我们为了减轻反共战俘的恐惧，并取得他们的合作，以便能够和平地将他们移到非军事区来，而向战俘进行的对于停战协定与‘职权范围’的解释，均以此种假定为基础。因此，这一新发展就自然地使他们对联合国军的诚意和中立国遣返委员会的工作怀疑起来了。在目前的最后阶段，若想使战俘相信在这桩已往曾对他们说过纯粹是单方面的工作里必须有共产党观察员及其他共产党人员参加的话，若不是不可能，也将是困难的。此外从严格的军事观点来看，假如在印度部队接收战俘时，没有这些观察员在场，这对印度部队也将是肯定地有利的。”（见附件一）
    六、本委员会的一致意见是联合国军关于观察员在场的解释是不正确的，并认为根据“职权范围”第一款接管战俘是“委员会的一项工作”，而双方代表有权在场观察此等工作。本委员会主席在其对哈利逊将军来信的复信中将此主张说明如下：
    “关于朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的观察员之在场，我愿指出不管你们在草拟‘职权范围’时的意图如何，我们只受双方所已协议的条款约束。这件事情曾经本委员会及本委员会的法律专家慎重考虑，而本委员会所得出的结论是：本委员会不能拒绝交接时有观察员在场。我愿提到第一款，该款在这一点上似乎是很清楚而不会使它本身有任何其他可能便利印度看管部队工作的解释。该款明确说明‘成立中立国遣返委员会，在朝鲜收容那些……战俘等等’，该款的最后一句说‘双方的代表应被允许观察中立国遣返委员会及其附属机构之工作，包括解释和访问’。你们所持的意见是：停战协定的谈判者所设想到并预期双方的观察员将出席的唯
  一工作，‘只是在解释工作的九十天期间的’。以上引用的第一款最末一句设想到观察员除了‘在解释与访问工作’的场合可以在场以外，在其他的场合下也可在场。本委员会认为接管战俘以及到了适当时候的战俘遣返，跟解释工作一样都是委员会的工作。你并且说在草拟‘职权范围’的时候，你们手中的战俘远在南朝鲜后方的战俘营中，因此从来没有设想到你们除了把这些战俘单方面地移交给印度看管部队之外，还要移交给什么人。然而第二条第四款明白地说战俘应尽速可行地从拘留一方的军事控制与收容下释放出来交给‘中立国遣返委员会’。同条第五款也提到中立国遣返委员会负责管辖战俘居留之处。这两款都说明看管是中立国遣返委员会通过其代理人印度看管部队的看管。因此，本委员会经过相当考虑以后得出结论：‘根据“职权范围”，本委员会不可能不给双方在接管工作中派遣观察员小组的权利。’”（见附件一）
      七、本委员会曾要求双方考虑放弃他们派遣观察员的权利。联合国军同意本委员会的建议，但是朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面拒绝放弃他们的权利。李相朝中将在他一九五三年九月十四日致本委员会主席的来信中声明如下：“我认为有必要说明，过去几天中印度看管部队在接管联合国军收容下的战俘时所遭遇的困难，完全是由于混在不直接遣返的战俘中的特务预谋制造的骚乱所引起，而决非由于我方观察代表与翻译人员的在场。如果现时停止派遣观察代表，不仅与协议不符，且将使特务分子及其支持者引为胜利，使印度看管部队今后更难维持战俘营中的秩序。对此我方完全不能同意。我方将根据协议继续派遣观察代表进行观察。”（见附件一）
      第二章
      八、当本委员会开始负责看管战俘时，战俘们显系对“职权范围”缺乏正当的了解，而且看来他们对“职权范围”中所规定的他们的权利和义务没有得到充分的通知。
      为了补救这种情况，本委员会决定按“职权范围”第九条第二十二款办事。本委员会为了达到这个目的，一致同意向战俘散发一份传单（见附件二），并将其内容向他们广播。
    九、联合国军在其一九五三年九月二十八日来信中表示他们不赞同该传单中的陈述（见附件二）。他们指称：该传单虽然没有“实质上离开停战协定与‘职权范围’的字面上的措词，可是肯定地忽视了其中的明确的精神。该传单的措词、提法以及强烈的暗示都倾向于不适当地影响双方战俘，要他们遣返而不要他们作自由和独立的选择”。本委员会不能赞同这些反对的说法，因为本委员会觉得传单中的陈述完全是符合于“职权范围”的（见附件二）。
    十、本委员会不能肯定地说散发和广播该传单对全体战俘有什么影响。常常发现传单被撕毁了。
  一些营场中的广播，或因故意组织起来的闹声，或因设于战俘营场里的扩音器电线被切断而往往弄得无效。但是在一个问题上，战俘，至少是他们的“代表”〔注一〕，却继续有误解，即他们认为没有义务要出席他们在法律上所属一方所进行的解释。这个问题将在报告中论述解释的进行那一部分中谈到。
   〔注一〕应该明确地了解本委员会既无时间亦无办法来探知战俘营场首脑的代表性。营中的组织与领导保留了其在移交给本委员会看管前的原样。因此这些“代表”不能认为是日内瓦公约第七十九条至第八十一条所设想那种意义的代表。
    十一、除了战俘所暴露出来的缺乏了解和误解之外，本委员会并获悉，联合国军送交本委员会看管的战俘是有紧密组织的。这种组织的主要目的是抗拒遣返和阻止那些愿意遣返的战俘行使此项权利。为达到这个目的，一部分战俘曾对另一部分战俘使用了武力，结果是任何愿意遣返的战俘都不得不秘密地冒着生命的危险去这样做。本委员会说不出来战俘是怎样和在什么情况下，在一定的领导之下被组织起来的。然而至少有一点很清楚：他们是如上所述那样有组织地被交到本委员会的手里来的。
    十二、一九五三年九月二十日，本委员会的捷克斯洛伐克委员提出了一个决议案（见附件三），这个决议案除其他问题以外，还要求立即采取步骤打破战俘营中现有的组织，把“特务与特务头子”孤立起来并把他们加以隔离〔注二〕。
  〔注二〕本委员会的捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员在一九五三年九月十日说，应隔离各“代表”和其他捣乱分子，并改编战俘营来打乱在原拘留国收容之下时建立起来的战俘组织。他们断言除非进行了这种变动，本委员会今后的工作如果不是完全没有办法进行，也要受到危害。他们建议各营之改编和战俘之重行编组，应该和接管工作同时进行。
    十三、上面一段中所提到的决议案曾经过非常深入的辩论，并于一九五三年九月二十一日本委员会的第十次会议上付诸表决，结果被否决了。本委员会的各国委员对捷克斯洛伐克委员的决议案中提出的问题所持观点，在第十四段至第十六段中有所说明。
    十四、波兰与捷克斯洛伐克委员的论点是：战俘营内的组织和领导实质上是恐怖性的，其目的完全在于以暴力胁迫战俘，使他们不行使其被遣返的权利。他们认为，本委员会不能承认这些组织和这些组织的领导，因为这些组织是在战俘移交本委员会手中看管以前就建立的。除非解散此等组织并解除其领导，就不可能保证履行“职权范围”有关愿意遣返的战俘之第一条第三款。他们认为，按照日内瓦公约，本委员会所能承认的唯一组织与领导，是基于解散现有的组织、在战俘营中创造正常的条件、因而使战俘得以自由选举其自己领导人的那种组织与领导。
    十五、经瑞士委员表示同意的瑞典委员的观点是：战俘是有组织地来到这里的，这是事实。他们认为，按照日内瓦公约总的精神，战俘应被允许仍在其有组织的团体中。然而关于惩办为非作歹者，看管部队司令官应尽一切可能来阻止和弹压暴力行为，并惩办那些能识别出来的犯有此类行为的人。他们认为，当时本委员会的首要任务是接管战俘，而在解释期间则给战俘以自由表示其意见的机会。
    十六、印度代表团的观点是：虽然隔离与移走战俘营中的“特务”、“肇事者”与“罪魁”是合宜的，甚至是必要的，但觉得要得到这个满意的结果，有实际的困难。因此印度代表团虽然同情捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员所表示的意见，但感到印度看管部队所掌握的力量不足以既保证对战俘之看管，同时又能应付战俘或其领袖对重新编营可能进行的抗拒。而且战俘的组织似乎是以极小的小组作为行动单位的，因此，这种单位可以透过任何改编的过程。所以，即使印度看管部队能够有兵力来进行改编，它所花的力量与因此而达成的结果和所冒的危险相比较将是不相称的。而且还有识别“特务”的进一步困难。印度代表团觉得一俟战俘接管完成，看管部队的力量获得增强，在本委员会工作的第二个阶段中将尽一切努力保证使每一战俘合理地脱离任何现存组织的威胁，并使每一战俘能自行考虑，自行决定。
    十七、自本委员会工作开始以来，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面即认为除非把在战俘中的所谓特务分子隔离并解除他们的影响，本委员会即不可能履行其义务，以保证每一战俘都有自由可以无畏惧地、不受暴力威胁地选择遣返。一九五三年九月十七日朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表李相朝中将在一份备忘录中表示了这些意见（见附件四）。
    十八、打破战俘组织并隔离所说的特务，这一工作所涉及的实际困难会是相当大的。当一九五三年九月二十日本委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员提出他关于这个问题的决议案时，印度看管部队的总兵力为一千五百二十四名精锐来福枪兵；九月二十四日当本委员会把二万二千六百零四名战俘从联合国军方面接管完毕时，印度看管部队的兵力仍和二十日那天一样，然而作为紧急措施，由行政人员中抽调了七百九十八名来加以增补。印度看管部队最高的兵力从未超过二千八百十八名来福枪兵。为了执行警卫战俘营的经常任务，即在各营区内与其四周的岗楼上放哨与地面巡逻，每夜需要一千三百四十七人，若以各人员隔夜休息为基础，则需二千六百九十四名来福枪兵，仅剩下一百二十四名后备兵力。这后备兵力是为了应付任何伤亡或任何特殊任务的。这样，当解释时或当不得不采取大规模的行动时，印度看管部队就不得不动用全部人员甚至包括因前一天值班而应休息一天的人员。还要说明的，就是南营有五十五个营场分为六个围场，面积是三点一八平方英里。看管部队的力量就是以如下假定为根据的，即：他们需要执行警卫战俘以保证看管的职务，并且在战俘营内不致发生大规模的骚动。任何打破战俘组织或把他们的“代表”隔离的企图都会引起大骚动。在这种情况下，还有由于战俘营的分布情况而引起的其他困难。战俘大批集中在各个营场中。营场与营场之间，围场与围场之间近得可以互相看见，互相听见。在这种情况下，甚至在一个营场里的简单行动都会引起其他营场的骚动。在大规模骚动的情况下，营场的分布情况，对印度看管部队进行工作会是一个很严重的障碍。
      第二部分解释
      第一章　工作细则
    十九、本委员会甚至在从事接管战俘的困难任务时，仍指定了一个小组委员会遵照“职权范围”第三条第八款丁项增拟关于解释工作的规定。该小组委员会在提出其临时报告时，建议该小组委员会应邀请联合国军和朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面提出他们各自对于进行解释的意见。本委员会依照这一建议采取了行动。联合国军分别于九月二十一日和九月二十三日的来信中，提出了他们的意见见附件五）；朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面于一九五三年九月二十二日的来信中，也提出了他们的意见（见附件五）。
    二十、双方对于进行解释的看法是如此分歧，以致无从发现共同基础以为本委员会的指导。本委员会顾到战俘营中所存在的情况，并顾到战俘所表示出来的对整个解释工作缺乏了解，乃不得不使用自己的独立判断，以制定可以保证“职权范围”之严格执行的工作细则（见附件五）。
    二十一、本委员会于九月二十六日的会上，最后通过了解释工作细则（见附件五），并于一九五三年九月二十九日把解释工作细则送交双方。
    二十二、联合国军就本委员会所通过的工作细则，向本委员会提出正式抗议。抗议是在他们一九五三年十月二日的来函中提出的，本委员会是在一九五三年十月七日本委员会主席致汉布伦准将的信中予以答复的（见附件六）。
    二十三、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面虽然大体上同意本委员会所通过的解释工作细则，但对其中一些规定曾提出若干批评意见。这些意见是在一九五三年十月十二日李相朝中将的来信中提出的（见附件六）。
    二十四、克拉克将军在一九五三年十月五日致本委员会主席的信中，概述了联合国军对整个解释问题的看法，下面是该函中的有关摘录（见附件六）：
      “总之，贵委员会的决定与活动，到今天为止，好像都是预先假定在你们看管下的战俘都当真是愿望遣返的。鉴于朝鲜籍与中国籍反共战俘连对共产党代表的具体出现都表示个人和集体的强烈反对，这一点是特别令人难以了解的。看来贵委员会并未充分认识到朝鲜籍与中国籍战俘好几个月以前就作了选择，没有武力或胁迫的话，绝大多数人将坚持他们的决定。假如对战俘的态度存在着任何真的怀疑的话，我极愿建议利用‘职权范围’第九款的规定，鼓励战俘直接向中立国遣返委员会及其附属机构陈述他们对于他们所认识到的情况的看法。这就会对他们自己的感觉和愿望提供结论性的证据。”
    二十五、本主席于一九五三年十月七日以一封为本委员会一致通过的信答复克拉克将军。下面是该信的有关摘录：
    “你的来信使联合国军和中立国遣返委员会对问题看法的分歧成为很鲜明，看来还是相当基本的分歧，你曾说：‘贵委员会的决定与活动，到今天为止，好像都是预先假定在你们看管下的战俘都当真是愿望遣返的。’本委员会并未曾作过这样的假定。另一方面，本委员会不准备接受下列一点作为既成事实，即：‘朝鲜籍与中国籍战俘好几个月以前就作了选择，没有武力或胁迫的话，绝大多数人将坚持他们的决定。’这的确是联合国军的主张。另一方面朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的论点是：这些战俘没有表示他们自由意志的机会，因为在战俘营中存在着组织严密的团体，据称这些团体对那些愿意遣返的战俘进行威吓。本委员会不准备依照这些假定中的任何一个假定来进行工作。本委员会不存任何成见，并渴望保证战俘有不受强迫、不受威胁进行选择的完全自由。假定‘绝大多数人将坚持他们的决定’，本委员会又怎样能发现一小部分可能改变他们决定的人呢？正是为了这个目的，双方司令部才同意在协定的条款中规定‘解释’。这是强制性的规定。而本委员会必须根据‘职权范围’提供解释人员必要的自由与便利。本委员会一方面有义务保护战俘不遭受武力或武力的威胁，也有同样的义务注意使本委员会执行‘职权范围’所赋予的合法职司。
    可能很多战俘将不要求遣返。但到现在为止，已有约一百一十个战俘要求遣返。这证明至少有些战俘确是希望被遣返的。更重要的事实是：在营中没有一个战俘敢于公开要求遣返。他们必须秘密地如此作，或是冒着被其他战俘打死或打伤的危险，或是冒着被武装警卫打死在铁丝网上的危险而要求遣返。战俘在表达愿望时所必须采取的这种不正常方式，使人们很自然地怀疑到全体战俘都不是自由的个人。在这样的情况下，我希望你将能体会为什么本委员会不能‘充分认识到朝鲜籍与中国籍战俘好几个月以前就作了选择，没有武力或胁迫的话，绝大多数人将坚持他们的决定’。本委员会当然将保证在解释时将不施以武力或胁迫。但本委员会不能使自己相信战俘们不在受到其他某些战俘的武力或武力胁迫。
    你曾建议应鼓励战俘直接向中立国遣返委员会或其附属机构陈述他们的意见，以平息对战俘们真正态度的一切怀疑。在我与战俘的首领们谈话的过程中，我确曾问过他们是否同意到中立国遣返委员会来表达他们的意见，即使这一点他们都不准备同意。显然，这些首领们不相信中立国遣返委员会，或是他们害怕一旦一个战俘被容许独自在一处，他可能改变他的主意而决定要求遣返。因此，你所建议的这个了解战俘态度的方法，对我们是行不通的。”（见附件六）
    二十六、本委员会不能不注意到，马克·吴·克拉克将军在他的来信中没有提到“职权范围”第三条第八款所规定的义务。他根据第九款所提出的程序不能被认为是可以代替第八款的规定的。
    二十七、本委员会并注意到联合国军的意见与战俘“代表”所持的意见相合。这些战俘“代表”继续对进行解释表示敌意。在这种情况下，本委员会多数认为宜寻求联合国军的帮助，将本委员会所认为关于战俘听取解释的义务一事的正确看法告知战俘〔注一〕。联合国军愿向其以前所拘留的战俘发表一项声明，而提供了一个机会（见附件七）。根据上述的目的，本委员会向联合国军提出了一份向战俘发表的声明文本。此声明是拟在本委员会授权之下以联合国军名义发布的。该声明列在附件七中，但是联合国军不同意本委员会的要求。
    〔注一〕本委员会捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员与多数意见相反，主张原拘留一方以任何方式接近那些已自其看管之下移交给中立国遣返委员会看管的战俘都是与“职权范围”相违背的。
      第二章　解释工作的技术安排
    二十八、进行解释的设备未经本委员会同意，即由双方在他们自己选择的地址上修建了，虽然印度看管部队曾事先获悉并予以批准。南营解释地区由于战俘数目关系而需要大规模的修建，其计划于一九五三年九月十四日为印度看管部队所批准。本委员会认为在批准这些设备以前，双方应获得机会对设备加以视察，并且如有任何意见的话，即向本委员会提出。
    二十九、双方代表于一九五三年九月二十六日被陪送至各该解释场所。双方都对这些设备的地点、设计、和布置表示不同意。双方并向本委员会提出了自己的设计并建议了选用地址。
    三十、本委员会得出结论，即：双方提出的批评是合理的，而且从执行“职权范围”有关解释的那一部分的观点看来，双方战俘营内修建解释设备的地点，也是不能令人满意的。九月二十八日，本委员会送交双方关于设计与地点的要求，并请尽可能在最短期内予以修建。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面同意对北营内的解释设备进行必要的更改，然而联合国军方面则表示他们在较短期内无力作到，因为据联合国军说，所建议的地点布有地雷，且其他方面也不适于建筑。联合国军并以得不到工程人员、材料和劳动力作为理由。
    三十一、根据联合国军关于有地雷存在的说法，及其对清扫该地区所需的时间的估计，本委员会认为自己不能担负延迟开始解释工作的责任，因此建议朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面，只要现有设备大体上能依照他们所提的设计予以适当地修改和扩大，他们即应在南营内现有的设备中进行解释，本委员会按照此意通过了一个决议案。捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员反对这个决议案，理由是本委员会没有适当考虑朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面的态度，就采取了急遽行动，且这个决议案的通过违背了“职权范围”——“职权范围”曾以向双方提供自由与便利的义务加诸本委员会身上的。
    三十二、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面宣称：联合国军方面关于有地雷存在的说法是不真实的，并且违背了九月十六日勃里安少将在军事停战委员会上的发言。在这一发言中，勃里安少将曾保证在联合国军控制下的非军事区内没有地雷及其他危险物，当这一事实为本委员会注意到以后，本委员会觉得先前坚持使用联合国军方面已建好的设备的决定是不适当的。
    三十三、一九五三年十月一日，本委员会向联合国军方面指出修建新解释区的地点，十月二日，本主席请联合国军方面估计一下根据朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面所提出的设计在新地点盖好设备所需的时间。联合国军方面没有许定愿意修建所建议的设备，而于十月三日答称：估计完成一处二十个帐篷的临时地区需要一星期，第一个永久地区需要二十天完成，第二个永久地区需要三十天。在开始修建工作以前，联合国军方面需要一个确定的要求。本主席在其十月五日的信里正式地作了这一个要求。在这封信里，他说本委员会确信联合国军方面可以在比所估计的少得多的时间内修建完成。联合国军于十月七日答称：该项估计仍然和从前一样。
    三十四、本委员会不能同意联合国军所估计的时间。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面已提出具体保证，准备在四天之内即可按照他们所提的设计修好设备。联合国军终于将修建时间缩短了一半还多，并于一九五三年十月十四日完成了修建工作。在修建解释设备及其他有关事项（例如修建某些道路）的问题上，本委员会与双方之间的有关往来信件已载入附件八。
    三十五、在回顾时并根据本委员会在南营中进行解释工作的经验，本委员会必然支持的看法是：联合国军原来修建的解释设备会是完全不适合的，这些设备在空间上太挤，在这些设备里进行解释想不受战俘喧嚣与暴力行为的最严重的扰乱是不可能的。
    三十六、由于修建解释设备的耽搁，以及因而引起的解释开始日期的延迟，本委员会要求联合国军方面和朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面同意延期，并同意将解释的时间顺延五天。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面对本委员会所作的这两个建议都同意；联合国军虽然同意延期，但表示不愿意同意将时间作任何延长。
    三十七、鉴于解释工作开始的日期进一步延迟，本委员会曾于一九五三年九月二十八日又送交联合国军一函，询问联合国军是否同意重新考虑其关于延长时间的决定，在这一问题上的有关通信已载入附件九。
     第三部分解释开始
      第一章　南营的解释工作
    三十八、一九五三年十月十三日本委员会通知联合国军，称本委员会已准备好于一九五三年十月十五日在北营中实际开始解释，也曾以类似的通知送交朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面。一九五三年十月十四日联合国军复信说，他们不希望在一九五三年十月十五日开始其解释，并称他们将把他们对这件事情的愿望通知本委员会秘书处。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面，按照解释工作细则第二十三款将他们的计划通知了本委员会秘书处〔注一〕。他们要求从第二十八号和第三十一号营场带出一千名中国人民志愿军被俘人员来听解释，他们并要求有对所有营场的战俘广播某些信函的便利。
    〔注一〕在开始解释以前，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面代表曾要求每日向朝鲜籍与中国籍战俘同时进行解释。他们说由于中国人民与朝鲜人民在一起作战，他们认为按他们所要求的这样方式进行解释是具有巨大重要性的。他们还要求将这两个国籍的战俘分成小组由许多营场中带出来。在指出从几个营场中带出战俘的实际困难以后，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面同意向属于一个营场的战俘进行解释，并也不坚持他们向朝鲜籍与中国籍战俘在同一天进行解释的要求。
    三十九、看管部队司令官接获要求，按照朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面所提计划做好安排。但是该司令官报告说：这些营场的“代表”们曾经表示，除非战俘们有机会当着联合国的新闻人士与本委员会讨论某些问题，他们不准备出来听解释。因为本委员会渴望这些战俘能尽可能和平地被带出来听解释，本委员会就同意了会见这些“代表”。虽然本委员会的波兰及捷克斯洛伐克委员表示怀疑这些人的代表资格和他们的诚意。
    四十、本委员会于一九五三年十月十五日早晨接见了各营场的中国籍战俘的“代表”。战俘们获得保证，他们在自由选择是否遣返时将不会受到任何胁迫，那些不希望遣返的战俘也获得保证可以被带回他们原来的营场。虽然有了这些保证，有关的“代表”仍表示不愿立即进入解释地区，且一般地都表现得缺乏诚意，因此看管部队受命包围营场，并且要求战俘从他们的营场中出来。战俘最后同意出来听解释。
    四十一、十月十六日朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军方面的解释计划，要求让第三十四号与第四十八号营场的朝鲜籍战俘出来，但是朝鲜籍战俘的“代表”断然拒绝出来听解释。在场观察工作的本委员会详尽地考虑了由此一拒绝所造成的形势。
    四十二、印度看管部队司令官已把第四十一段所述情况报告了本委员会。他说他提议派遣他的士兵进入该营场，一个帐篷一个帐篷地把人带出来，并提议如果在这一过程中，该帐篷内的战俘或其他帐篷里的战俘攻击他的士兵，本委员会应准其开枪。本委员会一致认为，虽然不应由委员会劝告印度看管部队司令官，但是在本主席指示的范围以内，而司令官认为适当的时候他可以自由行事。本主席的指示是：除了
    （一）自卫，也就是说在战俘攻击看管部队的时候与
    （二）有集体逃跑企图的时候，不得为了从营场里带出战俘而使用武器〔注一〕。
    〔注一〕使用武力带出战俘去听取解释这一问题是本主席在本委员会一九五三年十月十四日第三十一次会议上首次提出的，他虽然明言在原则上不愿使用武力，但他说如果战俘们攻击看管部队或企图逃跑的话，则某种武力是不可避免的。瑞典委员说除了集体逃跑或自卫的情况以外，在原则上他是反对使用武力的，关于使用催泪气的意见他还不太确定，他说假如要使用武力的话也应该是作为最后一着来使用的。瑞士委员说“职权范围”第三款禁止使用武力，因而除自卫而外不应该使用武力，使用催泪气的意见倒可以考虑。捷克斯洛伐克和波兰的委员说如果说服的方法无效，那末为了使解释代表能“接触所有的战俘”，除了使用武力以外没有其他办法。他们并说为了把战俘带到解释代表的面前，根据“职权范围”使用武力是不可避免的，又说至于武力使用到什么程度与在什么时候使用，则完全得由印度看管部队来决定了。
    四十三、在发出这一指示以后，印度看管部队司令官向本主席报告称：在该朝鲜营场中及其周围营场中的情况已经变得如此紧张险恶，以致司令官觉得已产生了新的情况。在这新情况之下，他如企图强迫战俘离开营场，就可能造成大规模的伤亡。他将此事提交本委员会，说他估计如果使用武力，大概要造成约三百至四百人的伤亡。在这种情况下，看管部队司令官请求本委员会明确指示他是否应不顾这些伤亡而进行工作。
    四十四、本委员会的波兰与捷克斯洛伐克委员说，看管部队司令官早已接到了明确的指示，本委员会不应讨论纯属军事性质的步骤，且看管部队在按照委员会的指示行事时，必须担负起军事责任来。他们并进一步声称：看管部队司令官应按照先前给他的本委员会的一致指示行事。
    四十五、本委员会的瑞典和瑞士委员觉得，虽然先前已作出决定将战俘带出听取解释，但是一个新的情况已经摆在本委员会之前。他们并觉得，印度看管部队司令官，在这一本质上是重大的问题上有权获得一个新的决定。他们声称在作出他们的最后决定之前，要将此事提交他们的政府，因为他们没有准备同意任何牵涉到在战俘中发生伤亡的决定。
    四十六、本委员会主席作为一个执行人来说，觉得在这样一个重大问题上，看管部队司令官有权获得委员会一致的支持，且本委员会整个来说既然是主体，就必须准备支持其执行人而承当使用武力的一切后果，因为本委员会未能达成任何一致决定，印度看管部队司令官乃停止下来并放弃使用武力将朝鲜籍战俘带出各营场的企图。
      第二章
    四十七、一九五三年十月十六日的事件，对本委员会提出了一个根本性的重要问题，即使用武力迫使战俘出席听解释。这一问题所造成的难题是永远不能得到解决的。在这个问题上意见的不一致，使得本委员会的工作在很多方面受到阻碍，因此将这一问题的各种不同看法予以详述是重要的。
    四十八、本委员会的瑞典和瑞士委员，对这一问题的看法是：“职权范围”和日内瓦公约的文字和精神都是禁止对战俘使用武力的，因此除纯粹纪律性的措施外，他们反对本委员会采取对战俘使用武力的任何行动。
    四十九、本委员会的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员辩称：按照“职权范围”第一款之规定，委员会之所以存在，是“为保证全部战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利”。“职权范围”第八款及第十款中，具体规定在第三款所规定的范围内使战俘能够行使他们的权利。本委员会有责任使所有战俘的所属国家有“自由与便利”向所有战俘解释“他们的权利等等”。本委员会当前已有足够的证据来支持这样的结论，即：确有战俘处于恐怖之中，并遭受武力之阻止不得行使其遣返权利。在这种情况下，本委员会最重要的职务与责任之一，就是保证营内情况得以改善，以使战俘免于任何恐惧。如果在执行这些职责中觉得有必要时，武力是可以使用的，而且按
  “职权范围”第七款的规定也是准许使用的。
    五十、印度代表团认为该代表团不能接受战俘已经打定主意的说法，这是与事实相反的。接受了这样的说法就将否定本委员会的存在基础。本委员会是承担了责任来按照“职权范围”帮助探知战俘在遣返问题上的真正决定的。管理解释工作是本委员会的基本与首要的职务之一，并为本委员会的最重要的责任。战俘反抗委员会执行这些职务与责任，依“职权范围”与工作细则来讲都是非法的。因此为了克服这种反抗是可以使用武力的。
    五十一、印度代表团觉得“职权范围”并不妨碍使用武力。第七款并明白规定，为了履行本委员会的职务与责任，此类武力是可以使用的。印度代表团并觉得给予解释代表以自由与便利，使他们能够对全体战俘进行解释，是本委员会最重要的职责。但当使用武力可能在战俘中造成重大伤亡时，印度代表团觉得本委员会应该给予其执行人以一致的授权与支持。任何造成重大伤亡的责任必须由本委员会的各国委员来分担。本委员会的委员们必须准备承当由于这种使用武力而产生的后果。显然本委员会缺少这样的支持〔注一〕，同时本委员会的瑞士委员宣称：如果使用了武力迫使战俘出席听解释，则他的政府可能不得不考虑是否还参加本委员会的工作。
   〔注一〕本委员会的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员坚称：“职权范围”第十一条第二十四款，要求本委员会依照大多数的决议行事，因此在使用武力上不必要有全体一致的决议，去寻求这样的一致是违反“职权范围”的。
    五十二、在第五十一段中所详述的情况下，本委员会不得不放弃使用武力将战俘带出听解释。本委员会执行人之其余可用的仅有方法就是劝说。本委员会的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员，反对为了劝说这些“代表”而与之会见，他们声明这些“代表”是特别派来破坏解释工作的特务，这些“代表”并不代表战俘，而且他们主要的力量是用在阻止战俘行使其遣返的权利，甚至于用武力，以武力相威胁和暴力行为来阻止他们。
    五十三、本委员会不止一次地考虑了隔离据称的“特务”的问题，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面曾提交本委员会一个他们声称是“特务”的名单，就“特务”一辞用来指“非被俘人员”而论，本委员会多数委员认为交来看管的战俘不属于这一类，而是真正的战俘。他们不能设想只因为有些姓名出现在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面提供的名单上，就必须把这样指名的战俘予以隔离，并且只有那些真正在犯不守纪律或其他该受处罚之罪行时被抓住的战俘才能予以隔离〔注二〕，本委员会只能够隔离那些真正在犯有不守纪律或有应受处罚之罪行时被抓住的战俘。有几个已经予以这样隔离了，但他们的数目是很小的，无论如何这种隔离远不是打散及重组现在的各战俘营。因为无法重组这些战俘营并隔离那些据称的“特务”，所以本委员会觉得也许保持战俘能作自由和不受拘束的选择的次好方法，就是把他们个别地带出听解释，那时他们就有机会来作决定了。
   〔注二〕本委员会的捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员要求隔离这些战俘，并建议即使不把他们的隔离当做一种惩戒措施至少也当作看管范围内的一种行政措施来做，他们并提议说按照“解释和访问工作细则”第一、二、三与五款应采取惩戒措施，以制止妨碍解释工作的特务，他们认为听任特务的暴力和恐怖，那样的政策曾使本委员会不可能执行工作。
      第三章
    五十四、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面按照“解释和访问工作细则”第二十三款，于十月十六日上午十时提出了他们十月十七日进行解释的计划，他们要求将某些指定的营场中的一千名中国籍战俘带出来进行个别解释。鉴于他们十月十六日的计划未能实行（见第三十八至四十六段），朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面要求应努力再次带出朝鲜籍战俘，并要求把他们十月十七日的计划作相应的修正。
    五十五、本委员会主席向朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面提出意见，并要求他们不变更其已提的十月十七日的计划，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面最后同意这样做。因为这些商谈占了些时间，十月十七日早晨没有能进行解释工作，结果在那一天仅对一个大概有五百名中国籍战俘的营场进行了解释。
    五十六、一九五三年十月十八日，中立国遣返委员会秘书处由朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面收到一九五三年十月十九日进行解释工作的计划，要求自第四十八与第三十四号营场带出一千名朝鲜籍战俘。由于印度看管部队仍然不能把朝鲜籍战俘带出来听解释，但却能把中国籍战俘带出来听解释，因此就向朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面表示，他们照顾到本委员会的困难，也许能考虑在朝鲜籍战俘被说服出来听取解释以前先向中国籍战俘进行解释。
    五十七、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面觉得不能接受这一建议，并重申其要朝鲜籍战俘出来之要求。朝中方面在一九五三年十月十八日信中曾表示态度，中谓：
    “事实证明安排战俘听取解释的困难是蒋、李特务在原拘留一方指使之下制造出来的，克服这些困难需要采取一些实际有效的措施，但如果在这些困难面前低头，不仅违反‘职权范围’和工作细则，而且将鼓励这些特务破坏解释工作，使中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队无法完成其任务。”本委员会考虑了此种情况。
    五十八、印度、瑞典与瑞士委员所持有的多数意见，认为本委员会为批准朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面所提计划的最高权力机关。工作细则第二十三款仅授与他们提出计划的权利，而接受与否则应由本委员会决定。本委员会在审议提交给本委员会的任何计划时，必须考虑到这个计划是否行得通。第二十三款未曾规定本委员会有义务不加修改地执行解释代表所提出的计划。本委员会有权以是否方便或是否行得通为理由而拒绝或修改此等计划。至于第七款，该款仅规定了向战俘进行个别或集体解释的权利，并未规定指定哪些个别的人或哪些集体的人的权利。
    五十九、捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员在委员会中所持有的少数意见，认为“职权范围”第八款授与解释一方向所有战俘进行解释的权利。解释工作细则第七款与第二十三款肯定了这一权利。既然解释代表有权向所有战俘进行解释，本委员会就不能命令他们向某些特定类别的战俘进行解释。“职权范围”没有授权本委员会去控制或更动解释的程序，只要此种程序没有违反“职权范围”中的任何具体规定。本委员会不能使用以“是否行得通”为根据的论据。因为将朝鲜籍战俘带出来是完全“行得通”的，如果有行不通的情况，那也完全是本委员会的错处。因为本委员会放弃了自己的权力，拒绝打散战俘组织并隔离“特务”与“罪魁”。最后，既然此种“行不通”是本委员会本身不做该做的事和做了不该做的事的结果，本委员会就不能以“行不通”为口实。因此，本委员会不能限制解释一方的权利，任何此类限制既然是违反“职权范围”的，自然也就是不合法的。
    六十、波兰与捷克斯洛伐克委员表示，如果本委员会坚持按照此一多数意见行事，那么他们就不参加本委员会的会议了，此一多数意见在他们看来是严重地违反了“职权范围”的。而当一项信稿
  （见附件十）付诸表决时，他们就退出了会议，因而本委员会就没有能够正式通知朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面：本委员会不能作出安排将朝鲜籍战俘带出来听解释，并再度要求该方考虑继续向中国籍战俘进行解释。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面则继续坚持要向朝鲜籍战俘进行解释〔注一〕。印度看管部队未能说服朝鲜籍战俘“代表”来听解释。在这种情况下，一九五三年十月十八日至三十日之间就没有能够进行解释。可是在十月三十一日由于终于说服了朝鲜籍战俘“代表”离开他们的营场，解释又恢复了〔注二〕。
   〔注一〕朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面坚持要向朝鲜籍战俘进行解释，是以他们的主张为根据的，即认为他们有权利向所有的战俘进行解释，并且本委员会不能限制此一权利，而要求他们只向一批战俘即中国籍战俘进行解释。但是该方准备对将予解释的战俘数目作一些让步。他们说他们准备同意带出五百名朝鲜籍战俘而不是一千名战俘并不拘来自两个营场中的哪一个营场（见附件十一）。
   〔注二〕看来朝鲜籍战俘拒绝听取解释，是与那时在战俘营外的某些有关方面对解释所采取的敌对态度有关系的。见本报告第九十八段及附件十七。
    六十一、次日即一九五三年十一月一日，又不能进行解释，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面在那天的计划中要求获得便利，在进行个别解释的同时向营场中和解释地区内那些二百五十人的等待营场中的战俘进行广播。看管部队司令官认为这样的广播必然会引起战俘中的激动，并可能造成骚动，而印度看管部队的后备力量既然都已用在进行个别解释的工作上，将不能应付此等骚动。鉴于这一忠告，本委员会主席就通知朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面说，除非他们同意不向战俘进行广播，否则就不可能进行个别解释。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面不同意这一建议。因此十一月一日的解释又不得不停止。
    六十二、为了消除上段中所提到的困难，本委员会主席向朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面建议应只向等待帐篷中的战俘进行广播，并且只在广播完了以后才开始个别解释。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面接受了这一建议，因而解释工作于十一月三日恢复，并在十一月三、四、五日进行了三天。
    六十三、十一月四日本委员会面临一个新的问题，根据朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面的要求，十一月四日带出来四百零三名中国籍战俘听解释。这些人中二百零五名经过了解释，收容营场里剩下的是其余未经解释的。由于没有额外的营场可隔离“未经解释的”和“已经解释的”战俘，因而把他们混合地送回他们所来自的营场。
    六十四、十一月五日丙字二十二号营场的四百零八名中国籍战俘中，只有一百三十六名经过了解释，“已经解释的”和“未经解释的”战俘又未能予以隔离。
    六十五、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面于十一月四日和五日对战俘的未予隔离提出抗议。他们声称解释工作细则第二十款已规定了按解释工作细则所定方式以隔离战俘的明确义务。他们并通知本委员会说，十一月五日所带出来的全部战俘其解释可能完成不了，要求印度看管部队进行安排，隔离那些剩下来未经解释的战俘。这一要求由于第六十三段中所述的理由不能予以执行。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面一方面抗议违反工作细则第二十款，一方面在十一月六日要求向剩下未经解释的战俘进行解释。战俘“代表”不服劝说，不肯出来。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面一直到十一月十五日仍继续要求向他们剩下未经解释的战俘进行解释，自十一月六日至十一月十六日未能进行解释工作。
    六十六、十一月十四日朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面一方面保留他们再要求对二十二号营场战俘进行解释的权利，一方面同意向另一营场进行解释。解释工作因此在十一月十六日恢复。当天庚字五十三号营场的四百零七名朝鲜籍战俘已被带出来听解释，但只有二百二十七人经过了解释。隔离问题又产生了。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面希望把剩下未经解释的战俘予以隔离，并把他们在十一月十七日带出来。印度看管部队未能这么做。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面继续坚持隔离并停止送交其进行解释的计划，南营的解释工作因而又中断。但一九五三年十二月二十一日解释工作又行恢复〔注三〕。
   〔注三〕（见七十八段至八十一段）
    六十七、南营中解释工作之停顿，引起了本委员会与朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面的信件来往（见附件十二）。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军对其代表进行解释工作时的条件表示不满。这些条件并不完善而且和北营中的条件来比是鲜明的对照，那里解释工作显著地不受任何骚扰且没有任何暴力的表现〔注四〕。本委员会不能保证南营中的战俘能有完善的秩序。本委员会关于战俘表现以及其他事项的多数委员的意见，已在本委员会一九五三年十一月十八日信中予以说明（见附件十二）。
    〔注四〕（见第八十二段至八十五段）
      第四章
    六十八、在进行解释的几天中，本委员会看到了战俘在解释帐篷里的行为具有一致的类型。战俘在进入解释帐篷的过程中，都安静正常；在帐篷之内，他们大多数都变为粗莽，用同样的语言喊同样的口号。看管部队得在每一个解释帐篷中，使用三个非武装人员以确保秩序和纪律。可是这些人员不能阻止战俘呼喊。这类行为的唯一例外是那些寻求遣返的，或是在非遣返的人中间不呼喊而采用与解释代表进行政治辩论的战俘，而这两类仅占少数。
    六十九、至于那些寻求遣返的，除了两个之外，他们个个一进入解释帐篷后，就寻求遣返了。这就有力地证实了本委员会的看法，即那些愿意遣返的战俘是受有胁迫而强行拘留在战俘营里的，而在他们的战俘营里是不能行使其遣返权利的。
    七十、有几个例子说明有关战俘费了相当多的时间才作出了决定。有一个例子是战俘看来带有恐惧和极端踌躇的情况，因而解释代表继续他们的解释。最终本委员会的主席参与其间，把战俘带走并予以隔离，以便使他能有时间来安静地考虑他的决定。该有关战俘在独自一人时，即决定选择遣返。他受了本委员会的检查，他在本委员会中证明心中灌注了这样的恐惧，以致虽然渴望回家但又不能摆脱那些恐惧，而在隔离之后他立即觉得比较放心了。这个战俘的事件曾成为联合国军方面抗议的主题，对这一个问题的有关信件列于附件十三。另一个经过了长时间的解释而寻求了遣返的战俘，看来也同样表现了恐惧的神色。
    七十一、本委员会很难估计由于害怕听说要产生的后果而未行使其遣返权利的战俘数目。同样也不能说所有那些未寻求遣返的战俘是自由自愿地这样作，而非由于在他们头脑中长期灌输的某些恐惧所致。
      第五章
    七十二、在通过解释工作细则第二十款时，本委员会一致承认，有必要将该款所提到的三类战俘分别看管。但是预先曾料到在实施这一规定时会有某些实际的困难。
    七十三、由于本委员会没有空的营场可资应用，因而可以采取两种办法：保证建筑另外一套同样的营场，或者逐营或每次数营进行解释。后一办法较为简单，因为这样可以不必进行需要很多时间才能完成的大规模修建。由于解释的开始曾有迟延，而在修建解释设备方面曾遭到困难，本委员会主席顾到作为委员会执行人所负担的责任，对于实施解释工作细则第二十款的方式提出了具体的保留。按照这一保留，应对整个营场或几个营场进行解释，直到有些营场由于战俘的遣返而空了起来为止。曾经觉得遣返的比率可能是这样：即一俟五千左右的战俘经过了解释之后，就会有营场可资应用，从而可对每批人数较少的战俘进行解释并可加以分别看管。在作这样一项保留时，有一个重要因素，是避免使印度看管部队由于扩大了营场的数目而有增加额外负担之必要。
    七十四、因此第二十款是以中立国遣返委员会主席所作的保留中所含有的某些假定为基础的。这些保留是与工作细则第二十三款同等有关的，而第二十三款是与第二十款有密切关系的。
    七十五、十一月四日与五日，与本委员会主席所作的保留有关的因素仍然存在。然而为了为这一局面寻找一个出路，本主席在其一九五三年十一月六日致朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面的信中，提出如下的建议（见附件十二）：“现在由于你们似乎已大大地减缓了个别解释的进行，印度看管部队就遇到了一个问题，即寻找空余的场所以便隔离已经解释的战俘和未经解释的战俘。没有现成的空余的营场可供此用，印度看管部队司令官所掌握的部队也不可能管理任何更多的营场，和保证警卫此类增加的营场内的战俘。可是我们始终渴望尽我们力之所及来满足你们的愿望。因此虽有人力上的困难，但我准备建立一个额外的营场以应付这种可能发生的情况。我希望你认识再建立任何更多的营场和充分地加以警卫是不可能的。如果你同意在向一个营场的全部战俘完成解释之前不要求新的营场，那末这个额外的营场将使印度看管部队能够隔离已经解释的战俘和未经解释的战俘。如果你同意这个做法，我们将在实际可行的范围内尽速着手增修一个营场。”
    七十六、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面在其一九五三年十一月七日的来信中，以如下的词句表示他们同意本主席的建议（见附件十二）：“为了迅速解决分别看管战俘的问题，再另外建立一些营场作为隔离战俘之用是完全必要的。虽然我们认为根据‘职权范围’及工作细则并无此项必要，但为照顾中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队的实际困难，我们同意在连续若干天向一个营场的全部战俘解释完毕之后，再向另一个营场的战俘进行解释。”
    七十七、本委员会主席向朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面所作的诺言，由于战俘“代表”所采取的态度而不能实现。他们说如果隔离战俘的话，战俘就不出来。战俘“代表”这种态度是没有理由的，因为将战俘加以隔离是符合工作细则的。然而他们之所以拒绝的原因，在于他们明白申述的恐惧，即打散战俘营就会导致营内组织的涣散，并从而削弱这些“代表”对大部分战俘所施行的影响。
    七十八、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面继续坚持他们的要求，即本委员会应为隔离战俘进行安排。随着北营解释的开始，而那里的有关战俘已同意隔离，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面便加强了他们关于隔离安排的要求，理由是南营中这种设备的不存在等于造成了对该方“不公平的情况”。本委员会的主席在他一九五三年十二月六日的信里说明情况如下：
    “战俘之未予隔离并非由于本委员会方面不愿如此，本委员会也确无意违反双方严格平等的原则，在目前的情况之下隔离之不可能是完全因为战俘的‘代表’拒绝走出营场--如果他们被隔离起来的话。”（见附件十二）
    七十九、李相朝中将在他一九五三年十二月八日给本委员会主席的信中再次要求修建隔离设备，该信之有关部分摘录如下：“隔离已经解释与未经解释的战俘是‘解释和访问工作细则’的明确规定，你在十一月六日的来信中曾明白答应在东场里战俘营修建隔离营场。工作细则必须执行，诺言必须遵守。中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队没有理由不在东场里战俘营执行工作细则的规定和你的明确诺言。你在十一月十八日和十二月六日的来信中说不能进行隔离完全是由于战俘‘代表’拒绝出营场，如果他们将被隔离的话。对此我们完全不能同意。铁的事实证明目前东场里战俘营中的所谓战俘
  ‘代表’就是联合国军方面所指派的特务，他们是我方被俘人员的迫害者和谋杀者，他们是解释工作的破坏者，他们绝不能代表战俘。中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队未能清除特务，打破特务组织，反而承认特务为战俘‘代表’，以特务的意志作为战俘的意志，拒绝进行隔离安排，这不能不令我们感到深切的愤慨。中立国遣返委员会从未认真作过任何隔离安排，如何能够知道隔离安排不能进行？听从特务之词而使我方解释工作陷于停顿的情况是不能容忍的。
    我坚决要求中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队修建隔离营场进行一切必要的隔离安排，并按照‘职权范围’与工作细则的规定采取坚决措施予以执行，以便我方解释工作得以进行。”（见附件十二）
    八十、隔离安排最后通过调整看管部队的居住设备而终告完成。一九五三年十二月十日朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面得到了关于这些安排的通知。
    八十一、一九五三年十二月十一日朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面提出了一九五三年十二月十二日向第五十三号营场二百五十名朝鲜战俘进行解释的计划，有关的战俘“代表”拒绝从营场中出来听取解释，解释因而未得进行。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面继续把他们向第五十三号营场二百五十名朝鲜战俘进行解释的计划送过来，战俘的“代表”坚持他们的态度。接着在一九五三年十二月十八日朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面要求提供第三十八号营场中的二百五十名战俘，有关的营场“代表”又拒绝出来听解释。但在十二月二十日朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面在保留向他们早先要求过的营场进行解释的权利的同时，要求从乙字第三号营场提供二百五十名中国战俘听取解释，这一营场的“代表”同意出来听取解释，并同意隔离，于是解释工作便于十二月二十一日在南营恢复。这一营场的其余战俘是在十二月二十二日得到解释的，十二月二十三日乙字第四号营场有二百三十四名中国籍战俘得到解释（见附件二十）。
      第六章北营之解释工作。
    八十二、一九五三年十二月一日联合国军通知本委员会谓大韩民国愿自一九五三年十二月二日起实际开始对属于大韩民国的战俘进行解释，北营的解释工作因以开始。联合国军要求每天提供三十名朝鲜籍战俘，解释工作顺利无间地一直进行到十二月十一日。有关的朝鲜籍战俘在该日坚持详细质问解释代表，且要求回答他们的问题。但解释代表表示不愿意再继续对这些纷纷抗辩的战俘进行解释，附属机构的主席因此叫战俘离开解释帐篷。战俘不服从发给他们的命令，过了一些时间之后，只得用
  一定数量的体力把他们带了出去。在这种情况之下，十二月十一日的三十名朝鲜籍战俘中只有五名受到解释。
    八十三、十二月十一日北营的朝鲜籍战俘向本委员会提出一项长篇备忘录，以申述他们的不满。美籍战俘和一个英籍战俘提出了类似的请愿书，来支持朝鲜籍战俘的请愿书，声称在本委员会考虑他们的朝鲜朋友所提出的请愿书之前，他们将不准备出来听取解释。
    八十四、由于朝鲜籍战俘所提出的请愿书是朝文写的，且有好几页长，所以翻译起来需要不少的时间，因此请愿书不能立即得到考虑。由于这个原故，本委员会到十二月二十二日才考虑了这些请愿书。对于美籍战俘的请愿书给了如附件十四所示的
  一个正式的答复。本委员会主席在十二月二十二日晚上把所持的立场通知了美籍及朝鲜籍战俘，但那些战俘拒绝出来听解释。然而联合国军于十二月二十三日向这些人进行了一次广播。
    八十五、在这种情况之下，北营已不能再进行解释。本委员会多数意见认为这些战俘根据他们所说的理由拒绝出来听取解释的做法是站不住脚的。与北营解释问题有关的信件载于附件十五。
     第四部分
      第一章　南营的战俘组织
    八十六、本报告第十一段中已提及存在于战俘营中的组织。现在打算对这一问题作比较详细的阐述。对于战俘组织的性质、目标和分支组织没有较充分的了解，就不可能对于本委员会所处的境地和本委员会在努力履行“职权范围”时所遭遇的困难提供全面的情况。
    八十七、本委员会在其工作最早阶段中便认识有战俘组织存在。在一九五三年十月二日所发布的新闻公报中本委员会全体委员承认这些组织已构成一个问题。该公报中有关部分如下：
    “毫无疑问，在接管时战俘已被完善地组成许多集团，而这一组织形式现仍在营中保持下去。在印度看管部队接管以前即已存在于战俘中的领导，继续对战俘施行其影响。这些战俘受到程度甚为可观的压力。在若干事例中曾牵涉到暴力行为。这便是本委员会今日所面临的问题。”（见附件十六）
    八十八、随着时间的消逝，本委员会得到了相当数量的材料。后来可以更清楚地看出战俘组织是甚为复杂而完整的。
    八十九、本报告附件十七含有若干封传进或传出营场时被看管部队截获的信件。这些信件表明有战俘组织总部的存在，并表明总部地点在汉城，受大韩民国宪兵总司令官的控制。这一总部与控制六个战俘围场的四个分支组织是相联系的。分支组织则控制着所有五十五个营场中的营场组织。在这三层组织之间有一个有效的通讯系统在工作，联合国军第六十四野战医院在这一通讯系统中构成了最重要的一环。
    九十、在这方面有一件事可以说一下，截获的一封最饶有兴味和最值得注意的信，是在一名朝鲜籍战俘于一九五三年十一月八日企图进入戊字围场第四十号营场遭逮捕时从他那里搜获的。本委员会现仍在调查他逃跑时的情况和他重来的企图，不过事实依然是这样的，即那封信是在他身上找到的。同样已经肯定了的是：他曾经从营场中逃出，数日之后又企图重行进入营场，这时他被捕了。
    九十一、这些组织的目标是多方面的。本委员会承认那些不得已而生活于战俘营条件下的人们必须有某种基于自愿而创立的以娱乐或求知为目标的组织。但本委员会极度怀疑这些必须与之打交道的组织是否属于这种自愿性质。外界势力的密切而不断的干涉证实了本委员会的怀疑。的确，连本委员会本身也处于大韩民国之威胁与恐吓的统治之下，进一步增加了本委员会的困难（见附件十八）。
    九十二、在战俘组织中那些有权有势的人所使用的方法是强迫性的。暴力行为曾施用于那些愿意行使遣返权利的人。一九五三年十一月一日在本委员会的附属机构面前有两名战俘遭到了毒打，因为他们表示了要求遣返的愿望。看管部队经过了最大的困难，才把这两名中国籍战俘从丁字第二十八号营场中活着解救出来。
    九十三、若干次凶杀事件曾经发生（见附件十九）。调查这些案件的努力遭到了战俘“代表”的抗议。对于每一次这样的调查看管部队必须进行一次大规模的行动。十月一日在医院中的战俘发动了一次狂暴的示威，阻碍了本委员会视察医院的努力。十一月二十一日对本委员会试图调查据报在医院中发生的谋杀事件的努力，医院病员又发动了一次狂暴的示威。
    九十四、本委员会不诉诸武力便不能应付这一局面，而这是本委员会最不愿意作的。战俘营中的情况是肯定地不利于“职权范围”第三款的实施的。
  第五部分结论
    九十五、按照“职权范围”第一条第一款，成立中立国遣返委员会是“为保证全部战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利”。同一条第三款规定“对……战俘不得使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强使其遣返，不得允许以任何方式或为任何目的……对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊”。
    九十六、由于战俘当其在营场中时均未享有寻求遣返的自由，并处于武力或武力威胁之下，本委员会确信解释不能按第八款所规定的特定方式在
  “此项战俘被看管的地点”进行。有组织的吵闹和狂暴的示威将阻碍这种工作的进行。本委员会不得不作出关于解释工作的附加规定，以便实行“职权范围”，特别是其中第三款和第八款。制定这种附加规定的权力系得自“职权范围”第三条第八款丁项。如此通过的，最重要的规定是关于对个别战俘的解释。解释工作细则第一款至第七款均旨在为
  “职权范围”的执行创造条件。
    九十七、纵然本委员会竭尽努力来为解释工作的进行创造适当气氛，本委员会却不能作出判语说，甚至在南营中处于其看管下的那些经过了个别解释的战俘是完全免于来自战俘营组织与其领导的、并与战俘营组织与其领导有密切联系的武力或武力威胁。不过必须声明：本委员会多数的意见认为在这种环境下并在本委员会所掌握的时间和力量之内，本委员会除为个别解释提供设备外，并不能做更多的事情。本委员会中捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员说这是不够的，必须同时改组各战俘营并把那魁首和所指称的“特务”隔离开。
    九十八、本委员会不能作出判语说，南营中在其看管下的战俘完全不受前拘留一方，特别是大韩民国当局的影响。它的侵犯使得本委员会不可能得出任何其他的结论。
    九十九、这些活动，加上战俘组织及其“代表们”的活动是无助于创造使战俘无束缚地行使其遣返权利的条件的。这些活动削弱了本委员会的看管和控制，并使其在任何时候建立战俘有选择的自由的工作异常困难。
    一零零、至于北营，本委员会并无证据足以证明原拘留一方对于营中战俘有任何活动，这些战俘既然很守纪律，而本委员会又未有任何证据，可以显示任何组织的存在和组织的性质及目标。不过在这里或可声明一下，即北营那几个选择遣返的战俘是逃出营场来要求遣返的，而逃出营场是比较容易的。
    一零一、委员会还可以声明，即据本委员会看来双方有权进行九十天的解释。联合国军自愿决定不在整个时期中进行解释而是在十二月二日起方开始他们的解释工作的，但是朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面一贯坚持要有一个整整九十天的时期。他们未能获得这样一个时期，其间曾中断多次，造成这些中断的原因已经在本报告的第二十八至八十一段中叙述过了。
    一零二、解释工作的开始的初次拖延，是由于本委员会未能使必要的设备获得修建，解释工作也有些中断是由于朝鲜籍战俘的“代表”所采取的态度所造成，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面仍继续要求对这些战俘进行解释，这便是十月十八日与十月三十日之间的情况。嗣后自十一月六日至十五日之间并自十一月十六日至十二月二十日之间皆曾有过中断，这是由于战俘“代表”拒绝隔离而造成的，当乙字第三号营场和乙字第四号营场的中国籍战俘“代表”表示准备出来听取解释时，解释便又开始了。
    一零三、本委员会必须提请联合国军方面和朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面注意，导致无法按照“职权范围”彻底执行本委员会之任务的情况的存在。附件二十详细载明了十二月二十三日在本委员会看管之下的战俘的数目，经解释后遣返的数目和那些未经此等解释而遣返的数目。
    一零四、按“职权范围”第十一款，本委员会负有一项义务，即“九十天期满后……未行使被遣返的权利之战俘的处理问题应交由停战协定草案第六十款中所建议召开的政治会议……”。〔注一〕这样的一个政治会议还没有实现。因此本委员会不能将他们的处理问题提交政治会议，故不得不将整个问题提交双方依照本委员会的报告加以考虑。同时“职权范围”第十一款应以何种方式予以实施也应考虑，特别是有关宣布“任何战俘，凡在中立国遣返委员会负责看管他们后的一百二十天内尚未行使其被遣返权利，又未经政治会议为他们协议出任何其他处理办法者……解除他们的战俘身分使之成为平民”的问题。〔注二〕
    〔注一〕捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员主张双方有权在“职权范围”所规定的整个九十天期限内享有向各自所属战俘进行解释的自由与便利，并主张鉴于朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面仅在九十天期限的一小部分时间内能进行解释的事实，本委员会应为他们解释工作的继续与时间的补偿进行安排，以补足整个九十天的期限。
    〔注二〕关于本临时报告第一零四段捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员曾作如下声明：“根据‘职权范围’之规定尤其是根据第十一条第二十四款对‘职权范围’第四条第十一款的规定加以解释，是中立国遣返委员会的责任。捷克斯洛伐克与波兰代表说明其对‘职权范围’关于进行解释所规定的九十天期限那一问题所采取的立场时，保留权利要求本委员会对执行‘职权范围’第四条第十一款的进一步办法，根据‘职权范围’的解释采取适当的措施。”
