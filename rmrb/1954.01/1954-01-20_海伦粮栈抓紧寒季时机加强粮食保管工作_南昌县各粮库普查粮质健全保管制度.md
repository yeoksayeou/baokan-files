Hailun Grain Depot in Heilongjiang Province, based on the situation that this year's grain storage volume is large, moisture content is high, and quality is worse than last year, recently held a meeting of veteran storekeepers and storage team leaders to specifically study the grain storage work for 1954 and formulated specific measures for current grain storage.

They first seized the opportunity of the cold season to carry out grain heaping work. The experience of Hailun Grain Depot in storing grain last year proved that heaping in the cold winter can keep the temperature inside the heap low. When the outside temperature reaches more than 30 degrees Celsius in summer, the temperature inside the heap can be maintained at 7.8 degrees Celsius. This ensures the safe summer passage of grain. Therefore, Hailun Grain Depot plans to heap all the soybeans for long-term storage before the end of January. Fifteen heaps have already been made (each heap containing ten tons of grain). All the grain that is heaped has been thoroughly checked and tested to ensure that the moisture content does not exceed 12.5% and that impurities are removed by screening, so that the moisture content and quality of the grain meet the standards for long-term storage.

Secondly, thoroughly disinfect the equipment for storing grain and keep the grain yard clean to eliminate insect eggs. This will prevent the breeding and reproduction of pests after the beginning of spring. The grain depot has now disinfected the equipment required for 180 grain heaps. Warehouses and grain yards are divided into dedicated cleaning areas by storage teams to ensure environmental hygiene and strive to become an insect-free grain depot in long-term storage.

At the same time, the grain depot is comprehensively checking the moisture and quality of the grain, putting the grain with lower moisture content and meeting the standards for long-term storage into the warehouse in a timely manner, and leaving the grain with higher moisture content outside the warehouse for sun-drying to reduce the moisture content before storing it in the warehouse. This ensures that various grains are stored separately according to their moisture content, and the phenomenon that the quality of a large heap of grain is affected by the high moisture content of a small amount of grain will not occur. The grain depot has now inspected half of its inventory of grain.

Another report: Nanchang County Grain Bureau in Jiangxi Province recently conducted a general survey of grain quality in warehouses in order to effectively carry out grain storage work. During the survey, grain depots adopted methods such as sun-drying, turning over the grain, ventilation, ditching, and well sinking to dissipate heat, and sorted out more than 300,000 jin of damp grain. After sorting, the moisture content of most of the grain decreased, and the temperature dropped. The moisture content of 75.94% of the stored grain in the county's grain depots was below 15%, and the grain temperature was between 13 and 16 degrees Celsius, basically eliminating the occurrence of mildew and germination accidents.

Through the general survey, grain depots established and improved grain protection systems, improved testing and inspection organizations, and stipulated testing and inspection methods. Most grain depots stipulate: conduct sensory inspections every day, measure temperature every three days, conduct small inspections every week, conduct large inspections every half month, and conduct a comprehensive general survey at the end of the month. Problems are discovered and dealt with in a timely manner, and the situation is reported on time. Grain depots also launched a cleaning warehouse environment campaign to remove dust, garbage, insect corpses, insect eggs inside and outside the warehouse, as well as weeds around the warehouse, to reduce the degree of insect infestation in the spring.

    海伦粮栈抓紧寒季时机加强粮食保管工作
    南昌县各粮库普查粮质健全保管制度
    黑龙江省海伦粮栈根据今年粮食储藏量大、水分多、质量较去年差的情况，于最近召开了老保管员和保管小组长会议，专门研究了一九五四年的粮食保管工作，并订出了当前保管粮食的具体措施。
    他们首先抓紧寒季时机，进行粮食作囤工作。海伦粮栈去年保管粮食的经验证明，寒冬作囤能使囤内保持较低的温度，到夏季外温达到摄氏三十多度的时候，囤内温度可保持摄氏七点八度。这样就保证了粮食安全渡夏。因此，海伦粮栈计划在一月底以前，将全部常年保管的大豆作起囤来。现已作好十五个囤（每个囤十吨粮食）。凡是作囤的粮食，都经过了切实的检查与化验，保证水分不超过百分之十二点五，并过筛将夹杂物清除，使粮食水分和质量都合乎常年保管的标准。
    其次，把保管粮食的器材彻底消毒，并保持粮场清洁，消灭虫卵，这样，就可防止开春后害虫的滋生和繁殖。该粮栈现已将一百八十个粮囤需用的器材进行了消毒。仓库和粮场都按保管小组划分了清扫专责区，保证作好环境卫生，争取在常年保管中成为无虫粮栈。
    该粮栈同时着手全面地检查粮食的水分、质量，把水分较小、合乎常年保管标准的粮食及时入库，把水分较大的先留在库外，待翻晒降低水分后，再入库保管。这样就可保证各种粮食按照水分大小分别保管，不会发生因为少数粮食水分大影响大囤粮食质量的现象。该粮栈现已检查完半数的库存粮食。
    又讯：江西省南昌县粮食局为了切实作好粮食保管工作，最近进行了仓库粮质普查。在普查中，各粮库采用翻晒、倒仓、通风、扒沟、打井散热等办法，整理了潮湿粮食三十多万斤。绝大部分粮食经过整理后，水分降低，温度下降。全县粮库百分之七十五点九四的储粮水分在百分之十五以下，粮食温度为摄氏十三度到十六度，基本上杜绝了霉烂、生芽事故的发生。
    通过普查，各粮库建立和健全了护粮制度，健全了测检组织，规定了测检办法。大部分粮库规定：每日进行感官检查、三日测温、一星期小检查、半月大检查、月终全面普查，发现问题及时处理，按时上报情况。各粮库并开展了清洁仓库环境运动，清除了仓库内外的灰尘、垃圾、虫尸、虫卵以及仓库周围的杂草，以减轻春季虫害感染程度。
