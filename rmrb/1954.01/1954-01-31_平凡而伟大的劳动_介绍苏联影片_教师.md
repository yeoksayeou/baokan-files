    The film "The Teacher" quite successfully portrays the brilliant image of a people's teacher who disseminates Soviet culture, and depicts the growth of new peasants living in affluent collective farms and under conditions of socialist culture.

    The protagonist, Sijieban (played by Soviet People's Artist Cherkasov), is an advanced figure determined to dedicate himself to the cause of communism through his hard work as a village teacher. The film portrays his activities and life in many ways, realistically showcasing his moving character and rich spiritual world.

    At the beginning of the film, Sijieban is placed in a difficult situation: his enthusiasm to leave Moscow and return to his hometown to engage in education is not only not met with sympathy and importance from the people in his hometown, but also encounters staunch opposition from his father and indifference from his fellow villagers. However, as a teacher, Sijieban is not shaken or loses faith in the work of a teacher because of these difficulties, because the work of a teacher is a part of the entire communist cause. Although it may be inconspicuous, it is important. Under the leadership of the Party, Sijieban began his ordinary yet arduous labor and resolutely launched a struggle against cultural backwardness.

    We see: Sijieban's first lesson in the village primary school instills in the new generation of farmers his love for the new life and love for the motherland; Sijieban teaches farmers all kinds of new knowledge at question-and-answer sessions; Sijieban conducts a principled struggle against his father's erroneous thinking in the family, freeing his sister-in-law from the heavy burden of family trivialities and placing her in a glorious labor position; Sijieban strives to oppose superstitious customs in the countryside, encourages the labor enthusiasm of young farmers, and builds school buildings for the school during Peter's Day. In these activities, the film showcases a people's teacher, a communist fighter, taking an active and combative attitude towards life.

    Due to the prosperity and development of the collective farm, due to his diligent and persistent labor, the backward face of his hometown – one of the thousands of Soviet villages – has changed, his father's narrow and conservative views have gradually been overcome, and a new generation of farmers with high cultural knowledge and communist ideological awareness has emerged from life in large numbers. If we compare the two significant segments in the film: Sijieban's first lesson teaching at the primary school, and the scene at the end of the film where Grunya answers questions about the German Peasants' War during the middle school graduation exam, then we can see how different the changes in between are. They have cultivated such an excellent new generation of communist builders for the motherland, who are not only outstanding laborers but also people with high cultural cultivation.

    Here, the film also displays Sijieban's communist ideas and qualities through the portrayal of his various daily lives. He never started from personal interests but devoted all his strength to the collective. Because of this, he obtained true happiness. Not only did he himself gain perfect love, but more importantly, the work he did for the people bore fruit, and the people's cultural level improved, making the construction of a communist society possible. At the end of the film, Sijieban said with emotion to the beautiful scenery of the motherland: "My life, my lovely life." His mood at the time is something we can fully feel. These descriptions are quite successful. Kravchenko, in his article "Multiple and Deep Expression of the Character of Figures in Films on Modern Themes," said: "If we are limited to portraying the labor activities of the protagonist without describing the history of the formation of a new Soviet family, without describing fulfilling and truly free love, without describing the new father-son relationship under Soviet living conditions, without describing new standards for evaluating a person, and without describing many other changes in the spiritual world of ordinary Soviet laborers caused by the accumulation of rich material culture by socialist society, then the face of our modern people will be portrayed palely in artistic works, and sometimes even distorted." The film "The Teacher" precisely describes Sijieban's family relationship, showing his moving character from another life perspective, and reflecting the new father-son relationship in Soviet society. Similarly, the film reflects the requirements for love life based on new moral and ideological foundations through the depiction of the love life between Sijieban and Grunya.

    In addition, the contradiction and struggle between advanced and backward ideas revealed in the Soviet countryside at that time in the film "The Teacher" are also very educational for us. Through the vivid portrayal of Sijieban's father, the narrow and conservative backward ideas in the consciousness of the peasants are truly reflected. This old guerrilla fighter is full of enthusiasm for the Soviet state on the one hand, but on the other hand, he still retains the conservative and narrow peasant consciousness and the backwardness of the lack of cultural knowledge shown in the development of life. He despises and opposes Sijieban's teaching work, believing it is unpromising, and constantly complains to and scolds Sijieban: "You really don't give me face, look at Guo Sijia·Hujiakefu, how quickly he is developing, he is really capable, he has become a leader, he also has a position, and he also takes airplanes. ..." Of course, this guerrilla fighter does not know that it is precisely in this backward countryside that a communist world with a high material and cultural life must be built. Through the character portrayal of Sijieban's father, an old guerrilla fighter, the film further expresses the important significance of the work of village teachers, as well as the long-term nature and importance of educating peasants.

    In contrast to the portrayal of Sijieban's father, the film profoundly and movingly depicts the image of young peasants with high cultural knowledge and communist ideology. Grunya is a representative figure, a new rural woman who has grown up under the Soviet system. The film portrays her simple, strong, and enthusiastic character, meticulously and powerfully depicting her inner rich spiritual world, vividly displaying the characteristics of a new generation of rural women. Although she is enthusiastic, she has a high degree of self-esteem and a deep understanding of her own life. Therefore, when she learns that Sijieban still has a lover, she firmly rejects his request to register in the district. Although this rejection is painful to her, she does not fall into the pain of love like old Russian women, but takes a firm attitude towards a more correct life, determined to make herself a scientific worker who contributes to the country. Of course, what more prominently shows her new ideological qualities is the segment where she answers the question of the German Peasants' War during the graduation exam. At this time, Grunya is already a new peasant who has mastered cultural knowledge and Marxist-Leninist doctrines. In her eloquent, enthusiastic, and firm answer, she not only shows the mature political qualities of the new generation of Soviet peasant youth, but also shows her firm confidence in life. She and the Soviet peasants have already grasped their own destiny. The new Soviet collective farm peasants are no longer the peasants of the old era, but new peasants under the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class, who are building a communist society side by side with the working class. The growth of Grunya's character contains such profound historical content.

    Soviet People's Artist Makarova achieved great success in playing the role of Grunya and was awarded the Stalin Prize for it. She was indeed able to create the image of this character vividly and poetically, with great life persuasiveness. Through the portrayal of the complex inner feelings of this character, the actor made people clearly feel the sincerity, tenderness, and enthusiasm of her character, as well as the firmness of her will.

    The film is full of a strong atmosphere of Soviet daily life and profound and bold artistic conceptions. This film, which expresses the lovely characters of ordinary Soviet people and the beauty of their labor, has reached a certain level in both ideology and art, and therefore won the Stalin Prize in 1941.

　　平凡而伟大的劳动

    影片“教师”相当成功地描写了传播苏维埃文化的人民教师的光辉形象，并且描写了在富裕的集体农庄生活和社会主义文化的条件下的新的农民的成长。
    影片的主角司界班（苏联人民演员契尔柯夫饰演），是一位决心以自己的乡村教师的辛勤劳动，献身于共产主义事业的先进人物，影片多方面地描写了他的活动和生活，真实地展示了他的动人的性格和丰富的精神世界。
    影片一开始，就使司界班处于一种困难的境地：他决心离开莫斯科回到家乡来从事教育工作的热情，不但没有得到家乡人们的同情与重视，反遭遇到了他父亲的坚决反对和乡亲的冷淡。但是，作为教师的司界班，丝毫也没有因为这样一些困难而动摇，或者失却对于教师工作的信心，因为教师工作是整个共产主义事业的一个部分。虽然它可能是默默无闻的，但它却是重要的。司界班在党的领导下，开始了他的平凡而艰巨的劳动，并且坚决地对文化落后的现象展开了斗争。
    我们看到：司界班在乡村小学里所上的第一课，就把他对新生活的爱、对祖国的爱，灌输给了农民的新的一代；司界班在问题解答会上教给农民各种各样的新的知识；司界班在家庭中对他父亲的错误思想进行了原则性的斗争，使他的嫂子解脱了家庭琐碎事务的重压，站上了光荣的劳动岗位；司界班努力反对农村迷信习俗，鼓舞年青农民的劳动热情，在彼得节为学校建筑校舍。在这些活动中，影片展示了一位人民教师，一个共产主义的战士对待生活所采取的积极的战斗的态度。
    由于集体农庄的繁荣和发展，由于他的勤恳的坚持的劳动，他的故乡——千万苏联农村的一个——的落后面貌改变了，他父亲的狭隘的保守观点，也逐渐被克服了，具有高度文化知识和共产主义思想意识的年青一代农民，从生活中大批涌现出来。如果我们对比一下影片中的有意义的两个片段：司界班在小学教书的第一课，和影片结尾处中学毕业考试时格鲁尼亚回答德国农民战争问题的场面，那么我们可以看到这中间的变化，是多么不同。他们已经为祖国培养出了这样优秀的新的一代共产主义建设者，他们不仅是卓越的劳动者，而且是具有高度文化教养的人。
    在这里，影片也从司界班的各种日常生活的描写中，显示了他的共产主义的思想和品质。他一刻也没有从个人的利益出发，而是把自己全部力量贡献给了集体。也因为这样，他得到了真正的幸福。不仅他自己得到了美满的爱情，而且重要的是他给人民作的工作有了收获，人民的文化水平提高了，使得建设共产主义社会成为可能。在影片结尾时，司界班对着祖国的美丽风景感动地说：“我的生活，我的可爱的生活”，他当时的心情，是我们完全可以感受到的。这些描写，是相当成功的。克拉夫琴科，在“多面并深刻地表现现代主题影片中的人物性格”一文中说：“如果我们只限于表现主人公的劳动的活动，而不描述新的苏维埃家庭形成的历史、不描述美满的真正自由的爱情，不描述在苏维埃生活条件下新的父子关系，不描述评价一个人的新的标准以及由于社会主义社会积累了丰富的物质文化而引起的普通苏维埃劳动者的精神世界中的许多其他变化，那么，我们现代人的面貌在艺术作品中就会被表现得苍白无力，而有时简直被歪曲了。”影片“教师”正是描写了司界班的家庭关系，从另一个生活角度显示了他的动人的性格，并反映了苏维埃社会新的父子关系。同样，影片通过对司界班和格鲁尼亚的爱情生活的描绘，也反映出建立在新的道德和思想基础上的对于爱情生活的要求。
    此外，影片“教师”所揭示的当时苏联农村在前进途中所表现出来的先进思想与落后思想的矛盾与斗争，对于我们来说，也是很有教育意义的。通过对司界班父亲生动的描写，真实地反映了农民意识中的狭隘保守的落后思想。这位老游击队员一方面对于苏维埃国家充满热情，一方面在他身上还残留着保守狭隘的农民意识和在生活发展中表现出来缺乏文化知识的落后情况。他轻视和反对司界班的教师工作，认为这是没有出息的事，不断地向司界班发牢骚和斥责着：“你真不给我露脸，你看人家郭斯加·胡加柯夫，他出息多么快，真行，当上领导啦，也有了地位，还坐飞机。……”当然这位游击队员，并不知道就是要在这落后的农村里，建立起有着高度物质和文化生活的共产主义世界。影片通过对于司界班父亲这位老游击队员的性格描写，进一步表现出乡村教师工作的重要意义，以及对于农民进行教育的长期性和重要性。
    影片对比着司界班父亲的描写，极其深刻感人地描写出了具有高度文化知识水平和共产主义思想的青年农民的形象。格鲁尼亚是一个代表人物，这是一位在苏维埃制度下成长起来的新的农村妇女。影片刻划了她的单纯、坚强和热情的性格，细致有力地描写了她内在的丰富的精神世界，生动地展示了新一代农村妇女的特点。她虽然是热情的，但是她却有着高度的自尊心和对于自己生活的深刻理解。因此，当她知道司界班还有着爱人的时候，她就坚决拒绝了他到区里登记的要求。虽然这拒绝在她是痛苦的，但是她并没有像旧俄罗斯妇女那样陷在爱情的痛苦里，而是以坚定的态度走向了更加正确的生活，决心要使自己成为对国家有贡献的科学工作者。当然，更突出地展示了她的新的思想品质的，是在毕业考试时回答德国农民战争问题的一段描写里。这时候的格鲁尼亚，已经是一个掌握了文化知识和马克思列宁主义学说的新的农民。在她那雄辩的、热情的、坚定的回答里，不仅表现出苏联新一代农民青年那种成熟的政治品质，而且表现出她对于生活的坚强信心。她和苏维埃农民已经掌握了自己的命运。新的苏联集体农庄的农民，再也不是旧时代的农民，而是在共产党和工人阶级领导下的新的农民，他们和工人阶级并肩建设着共产主义社会。格鲁尼亚的性格的成长，包含着这样的深刻历史内容。
    苏联的人民演员马卡洛娃，饰演格鲁尼亚一角，得到了很大成就，并因此获得斯大林奖金。她确实能够生动和富有诗意地、具有很大生活说服力地创造了这个人物的形象。演员通过对于这个人物的复杂的内心感情的刻划，使人们明确地感到了她的性格的真挚、温柔和热情，以及她的意志的坚定。
    影片中充满着强烈的苏维埃的日常生活气息和深刻大胆的艺术构思。这部影片，表现了普通苏维埃人的可爱的性格和他们劳动的美，在思想上和艺术上，都达到一定的水平，因此获得了一九四一年的斯大林奖金。
