    An Exploration Team Active in the Tianshan Mountains
    By our reporter Shao Rui
    As winter approached, we traveled from the west of the Tarim Basin along a newly opened mountain road, deep into the Tianshan Mountains for over a hundred kilometers, arriving at a sparsely populated cluster of peaks. There were no rivers or trees, only some wooden houses moved from elsewhere and stone houses built on the spot. But now, the roar of the generator's motor echoed through the valley, and electric lights shone brightly. It had become a place of vibrant and intense activity for the glorious exploration team.

    In this desolate and remote mountainous area, it is said that as early as a hundred years ago, people constantly risked coming here. The yellow stone debris scattered across the mountains attracted people's attention. They took these things to nearby towns and smelted them using primitive methods. However, they only obtained the most easily discovered oxide ores, and they did not recognize the better sulfide ores, nor did they know how to smelt them. After liberation, more and more people voluntarily reported mineral deposits; they sent ores from all over to the People's Government, and described many traces of past mining by the masses. This provided many clues for exploration. After the exploration team searched and surveyed in the vicinity, they discovered that this was a very rich mineral area. When we climbed over layers of steep slopes and ascended the high mountains of the mining area this time, we often saw many mountain caves in the mountain depressions, resembling the dens of wild beasts. Those were excavated by people using manual methods in the past. A collapsed cave, it is said, once had six miners crushed to death inside. This time, we also saw winding paths like snakes along the extremely steep cliffs. Those were the traces left by the exploration team members wearing studded shoes and treading on ice and snow. On a peak about three thousand meters above sea level, wooden frames and bundles of grass were erected high, marking their triumphant exploration.

    In October 1952, apart from the accumulated snow on the nearby high mountains and the strong winds that occasionally blew in from the mountain passes, there was nothing here. Only the comrades of the exploration team came here with simple tools such as hammers and telescopes. Initially, they lived in the open air. Soviet expert Nikoliski would get out of his sleeping bag early in the morning and lead the Chinese comrades in exploration work, persisting until the heavy snow closed the mountains in November.

    In March 1953, this exploration team came again, bringing with them portable wooden houses and generators. When installing the generator, the new workers from the nearby nomadic areas did not even know how to connect the wires. Therefore, even these simple technical tasks had to be done by the experts themselves. On the day the generator was turned on, the barren mountains suddenly seemed to bloom with many dazzling flowers, and the people who had never seen electric lights before cheered together with joy. But unexpectedly, heavy snow suddenly fell again, and they encountered the difficulty of being cut off from supplies. For several days, they were so hungry that they had no choice but to eat the corn originally intended to feed the horses and the leftovers from the kitchen intended to feed the dogs. They waited every day for the rescue trucks to arrive. Sure enough, one day the trucks brought a large amount of flour, and they jumped with joy, unloading the flour overnight and immediately cooking things on the stove. When summer came, it rained again. The machine parts that they had just transported to the mountains with great effort were washed down from the mountain gullies by the rain. The flat-roofed wooden houses they lived in also leaked rain "哗哗". After covering themselves with raincoats to sleep at night, they put washbasins on their bodies to catch the rain.

    When they transported the heavy drilling machine from the ground to a steep slope about three hundred meters high, they first used ten-wheeled trucks to transport the disassembled machine parts to the bottom of a cliff, and then mobilized many people to pull them up to the most difficult place. They could only pull up a dozen meters a day, and finally installed it on a very high hillside. Now, this drilling machine has long been operated on the hillside by workers of various ethnic groups. On the day we came to visit them, Uighur foreman Mamut was operating the drill, Kyrgyz worker Asang was assisting, and Tatar new worker Hadar was watching and learning. These herdsmen and farmers of various ethnic groups in the border areas had never seen these complex machines before, but Soviet experts taught them the skills to operate them, turning them into modern mining workers.

    The advanced geological work techniques of the Soviet Union have taken root and blossomed here. Young geologist Zhang Liangchen has learned with great success. He was the first to come here. The advanced methods of Soviet geological work such as "blasting," "trench exploration," and "geological observation points" were things he had never learned before. At first, he watched the Soviet experts do it first, and then learned to do it himself, learning the whole set of skills in this way. This young man, who did not even recognize ore when he first came, can now lead a small team of workers in another mountainous area, set up several white tents, and competently carry out exploration work.

    It is this kind of exploration team that has quickly measured the ore reserves and ore locations here, proving that this is a promising new high quality mining area in the Chinese border region. This time, we picked up a piece of ore in the cave at random and looked at it with a magnifying glass, and we could see those bright, crystal-like small particles like stars in the sky. In some gaps in the stones, crystals could be seen with the naked eye, as if they were inlaid. When we stood on the top of the high mountain and looked around the mining area with a telescope, the outline of the entire mining area was displayed in front of us in the vast and boundless Tianshan Mountains. At this moment, it is also easiest to make people happily think of the future development prospects of this great border area!

    This time, people from the State Planning Commission of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Heavy Industry have come here to understand the situation of the mining area and study how to develop the mining area. This greatly encouraged the work enthusiasm of the exploration team personnel; they said that this was exactly what they had always hoped for. Now, strong winds have already blown and snowflakes have floated in the area near the mining area, and the season of heavy snow blocking the mountains has arrived again. They decided not to leave here anymore, and they are fighting against the severe cold. According to the experts' design, they have already dug the first deep water well in this mountainous area. Local Kyrgyz men and women workers are building new stone houses with large, small, square, and round stones. The workers are also installing air compressor steel pipes, preparing to use pneumatic drills to replace the work of hammering holes by hand. Everything is ready, and the pioneers of building the border area are confidently welcoming this more arduous struggle!

    活跃在天山的一支勘探队
    本报记者　邵锐
    冬天将要到来的时候，我们从塔里木盆地的西边沿着一条新走出来的山路，深入天山山脉一百多公里，来到一处人烟稀少的丛峰里。这儿没有河流和树木，只有一些从别处搬来的木屋和就地垒起的石屋。但是现在，发电机的马达声已在山谷里“嘟嘟嘟”地响起来，电灯放射出了灿烂的光芒，这儿已经成为光荣的勘探队员们热烈紧张的活动场所了。
    在这荒凉辽远的山区里，据说早在百十年前，就不断有人冒险来到这里。那撒满山头的黄色石渣，引起了人们的注意，他们把这些东西带到附近的城镇里，用原始的方法烧炼，但是他们所得到的只是那些最易发现的氧化矿石，而那些更好的硫化矿石，他们是不认得，而且也不会把它烧炼出来的。解放后，这里自动报矿的人一天天多起来了；他们把远近各地的矿石纷纷送到人民政府去，并说出许多过去群众挖矿的痕迹。这样就提供了许多勘探的线索。勘探队到附近各处搜索勘查以后，发现这里就是一个蕴藏很丰富的矿区。当我们这次爬过层层的陡坡，攀登矿区的高山时，一路上常看到山凹里许多像野兽的穴洞似的山窟窿，那就是当年人们用手工方法挖掘出来的。有一个塌落了的山洞，据说曾有六个挖矿的人被压死在那里。这次，我们也看到那非常险峻的峭壁间，有一条条像蛇行的蜿蜒小路，那是勘探队员们穿着钉鞋踏着冰雪所留下的踪迹。在那拔海约三千公尺的一个峰顶上，高高地插起木架和草把，就是他们勘探胜利的标记。
      一九五二年十月间，除了附近高山的积雪和从山口不时吹来的大风，这儿什么都没有，只有勘探队的同志们带着锤头和望远镜等简单工具来到这里。最初，他们住在露天里，苏联专家尼考里斯基一早就从睡袋里爬出来，带领着中国同志们作勘探工作，就这样一直坚持到十一月大雪封山的时候。
    一九五三年三月，这一支勘探队又来了，他们搬来了活动木板屋和发电机等。当安装发电机的时候，新从附近招来的游牧区民族工人，开始连电线也不会拉，于是连这些哪怕是很简单的技术工作也要专家亲自动手做。当发电的那一天，荒山上一下子像开放了许多耀眼的花朵，那些从来也没有见过电灯的人们，都高兴得一齐欢呼起来。可是后来想不到忽然又下起大雪来，他们遭遇到路断粮绝的困难。有几天，他们饿得没有办法，连那些原来准备喂马的包谷和厨房里剩下准备喂狗吃的东西，也被大家吃光了。他们天天盼望着救援的汽车来，果然，有一天汽车运来了大量的面粉，他们高兴得跳了起来，连夜就把面粉卸下来，马上就在炉火上做东西吃。夏天来到，这里又下起雨来了，他们费了很大力气刚运到山上去的机器零件箱，又被雨水从山沟里冲了下来。他们住的平顶木板屋也“哗哗”地漏起雨水来。晚上盖着雨衣睡下后，他们又把洗脸盆放在身上来接雨。
    当他们从地面向高约三百公尺的陡坡上运送笨重的钻探机时，先用十轮大卡车把拆散的机件运到一个悬崖的下边，然后动员了许多人再拉上最困难的地方去，一天只能拉上十几公尺，最后终于把它安装在很高的山坡上，现在，这架钻探机早已在山坡上由各民族工人们开动起来了。这一天我们来访问他们时，正由维吾尔族工长马木提掌钻、柯尔克孜族工人阿桑做助手，塔塔尔族新工人哈达尔在旁边看着学习。这些边疆地区的各族牧民和农民们，从来没有看见过这些复杂的机器，但苏联专家教会了他们操作的本领，使他们变成现代化生产的矿山工人了。
    苏联的先进地质工作技术，已经在这里开花结果。青年地质工作者张良宸同志学习得很有成绩。他是第一个来到这里的，苏联地质工作的“爆炸”、“槽探”和“地质观察点”等先进方法，他是从未学过。开始他也是先看着苏联专家做，然后自己学着动手做，就这样一件件地学会了全套本领；这一位初来时连矿石也不认得的青年人，现在已经可以单独领着一小队工人在另一个山区、搭起几座白色的帐篷，胜任愉快地进行勘探工作了。
    就是这样的一支勘探队，他们已经很快地把这里的矿藏量和矿位测定出来了，证明了这里是中国边疆地区一个很有发展前途的优良新矿区。这次，我们在洞里随便拾起一块矿石用扩大镜照一下，就会看见那些满天星斗似的亮晶晶的小粒现出来；有些石块的隙缝里用肉眼就可以看见像镶嵌着的结晶体。当我们站在高山头上，拿起望远镜向矿区周围了望时，在那辽阔无边的天山群峰里，整个矿区的轮廓都展现在我们的面前。这时刻，也最容易引起人们愉快地想到这伟大边疆地区将来发展的远景啊！
    这次，中央人民政府国家计划委员会和重工业部都派人来到这里，他们来了解矿区情况和研究矿区如何开发的问题。这大大地鼓舞了勘探队人员的工作情绪；他们说，这正是他们经常所盼望着的。现在，矿区附近一带早已刮起大风、飘起雪花来了，大雪封山的季节又到来了。他们决定不再离开这里，他们正在和严寒来搏斗。他们早已根据专家的设计，在这山区挖掘了第一口深水井。当地柯尔克孜族的男女工人们正用大、小、方、圆的石块干砌着新的石屋。工人们还正在安装压风机钢管，准备用风钻来代替手锤打眼的工作。一切工作都准备好了，建设边疆的先锋队正满怀信心地迎接着这一场更加艰巨的斗争！
