Everything for the Realization of the Nation's General Line
    —New Year's Message, 1954

    The year 1954 arrives amidst the immense victories already achieved by our nation's general line during the transition period, and it will undoubtedly bring even greater victories to our nation's more than 500 million people. This new year marks the second year of our nation's First Five-Year Plan. We will strive even harder to complete the nation's construction plan, to realize the nation's general line during the transition period, and to further advance the cause of the nation's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

    In the past year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country united and worked hard, enabling the national economy to develop further on the basis of recovery. The proportion of the socialist economy continued to grow, national prices remained stable, the people's level of awareness further improved, the people's living standards also improved somewhat, and the system of the people's democratic dictatorship became more consolidated. These significant achievements have laid a solid foundation for our country's planned economic construction. In 1954, we will build upon this foundation, further implement the guidelines and specific policies stipulated in the nation's general line, and enable all aspects of the national economy to achieve further development.

    In developing the national economy, we must strive to further build a new socialist industry, expand existing socialist industries, and manage them even better. We must strive to implement the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. These two tasks must be closely linked. Like a bird, it must have a main body, which is the development of socialist industry; and it must have a pair of wings, which are the transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and the transformation of private industry and commerce. To transition to socialism, it is certainly not possible without the main body, nor is it possible without the wings. We must ensure that both of these tasks achieve new successes in 1954. Although, we understand that it will take a long time to transition to socialism, we must move forward step by step, year by year, and month by month, in order to achieve our goal. Since our country began its First Five-Year Plan last year, it has achieved great results. The broad masses of people have a clearer and more concrete understanding of the nation's general line, and everyone feels that they have a "purpose." This increase in political awareness gives us even more confidence as we greet the tasks of 1954 today.

    The tasks we must complete in 1954 are enormous. These tasks can certainly be completed. By comparing the achievements of 1953, we can believe that this year will definitely be stronger than last year.

    Last year, the state's investment in basic construction accounted for approximately one-third of all fiscal expenditures. There were 130 important construction projects, including China's first fully automated seamless steel tube factory, a large-scale rolling mill, and No. 7 blast furnace, which have recently started production in Anshan. Nine new railways and more than 5,000 kilometers of highways have also been constructed. This year, the state will further concentrate its efforts on the construction of heavy industry and railways, with more basic construction projects than last year included in the 1954 annual plan. These constructions play a decisive role in our country's industrialization. They are the foundation for ensuring our country's economic independence and national defense security, strengthening the leading role of our country's socialist economic components, continuously promoting our country's economic advancement, and gradually improving the people's living standards. We must follow the state's plan and guarantee the completion of these basic construction tasks.

    Due to the rapid development of basic construction, nearly seventy newly built and expanded factories and mines will be put into production this year. These include coal mines, power plants, oil mines, steel plants, non-ferrous metal mines, machine factories, textile factories, paper mills, and so on. Putting these factories and mines into production will make it possible to further increase industrial production and further meet the needs of national construction and the people's production and life. According to preliminary calculations, the total industrial output value of state-owned, locally state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative-run industries nationwide in 1953 is expected to complete 104 percent of the state plan, an increase of approximately 30 percent or more compared to the total industrial output value in 1952. On this basis, we must also ensure that the total industrial output value in 1954 continues to increase by approximately 17 percent compared to 1953. In order to further achieve the goal of increased industrial production, we must also fully utilize the equipment efficiency of state-owned and locally state-owned industries, systematically adjust existing industries, especially the equipment of the machinery industry and light industry, improve product design work, increase new varieties, and improve specifications. We must use our best efforts to improve quality, reduce costs, tap the potential of existing enterprises, and guarantee the further growth of industrial production.

    We must have a correct understanding of the issue of the speed of industrial development. On the one hand, we must see that as a result of the increase production and practice economy movement, the potential of various industrial departments has been greatly developed, and the figures for the completion of tasks in 1953 by various departments have been greatly increased compared to the past. Our plans are also gradually approaching reality. On this basis, it is certainly inappropriate to demand too much, to continue to increase according to the original percentage. But on the other hand, we must also see that our current level of enterprise management has improved, the level of worker proficiency has also improved, and new factories and mines are being put into production in increasing numbers, which enables the speed of industrial growth to continue to be strengthened. Therefore, we must try every possible means, use all possible conditions, guarantee the necessary rate of industrial growth, and should not have any conservative ideas. We should not think that "potential has been exhausted" or want to "hold back." This kind of conservative thinking is detrimental to the country and detrimental to the people. According to actual needs and possibilities, the growth rate of our country's industry should currently be strengthened from three main aspects: First, in terms of basic construction, we must pay attention to the effect of investment, so that newly built and expanded enterprises can be put into production as soon as possible, and existing enterprises that can be expanded and renovated should be appropriately expanded and renovated. Second, improve the management level of existing enterprises, improve the technical production management of enterprises; strengthen the technical organizational measures of existing enterprises; promote advanced experience; in particular, we must strive to promote advanced experience with decisive significance, in order to raise backward enterprises to advanced levels, and to regularize the increase production and practice economy movement. Third, whether in basic construction or industrial production, we should make the greatest effort to achieve coordination and cooperation in all aspects, help each other, promote each other, and overcome the isolated views and phenomena of decentralism of "only caring about oneself and not asking others for anything."

    We should recognize that giving full play to the greatest initiative and creativity of the working class, and completing and overfulfilling the plans for industrial production and basic construction with unparalleled perseverance, is the decisive link in ensuring the realization of our country's construction plan and the realization of the general line during the transition period. All organizations leading industrial production and enterprises, from senior leading organs to grassroots units, should mobilize all forces, calculate the potential forces in existing enterprises, calculate the production capacity of newly built enterprises, calculate the time, calculate the speed, and strive step by step to win the victory of socialist construction in our country. At the same time, only through such efforts can we train our working class themselves, and have more strength to lead the broad masses of people to fight for the realization of the nation's general line.

    In line with the development of industry, new requirements have also been put forward for agricultural production in 1954. Although agricultural production last year did not complete the plan for increased production due to disasters in some areas, the total grain output in our country last year was still about the same as in 1952. According to the actual needs of the country and the people and the possible conditions in agricultural production, it is estimated that in 1954, the total national grain output is required to increase by tens of billions of catties of grain compared to the actual total output in 1953, which can be achieved. Because the broad masses of farmers in our country, after being educated by the general line, have generated great enthusiasm for the state's economic construction plan and the road to socialism, their political awareness has been further improved, and their enthusiasm for production has also increased. The mutual aid and cooperation movement has developed rapidly. These are all favorable conditions for promoting increased agricultural production. In 1953, the number of organized farming households nationwide accounted for 43 percent of the total number of farming households. There were approximately 10 million agricultural mutual aid teams with socialist sprouts, and nearly 15,000 agricultural production cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature. This type of agricultural production cooperative can become an appropriate form for guiding farmers to transition to higher-level agricultural production cooperatives (collective farms) of a completely socialist nature. It is increasingly showing an important position in the current overall mutual aid and cooperation movement. According to the situation in various parts of the country, the current semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives, due to the enthusiastic demands of farmers and their voluntary organization, are planned to develop to 35,800 in 1954. This plan is entirely possible to complete and exceed. We must strive to lead farmers to run agricultural production cooperatives well, and use this method to drive the more widespread development of agricultural mutual aid teams. Mutual aid teams are a primary form of gradually guiding farmers to implement socialist transformation. Their development is an important foundation for the development of agricultural production cooperatives, so we must also pay full attention to strengthening leadership over them.

    In addition to mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production, we should also actively run rural supply and marketing cooperatives and rural credit cooperatives. These are the three forms of rural cooperatives, which have their own division of labor, but are also interconnected and promote each other. Supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives can help farmers get rid of commercial exploitation, grain hoarding and speculation, and the exploitation of usury, supply farmers with the necessary means of production and means of livelihood, serve rural production, and promote the development of mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production. Supply and marketing cooperatives must also further implement the connection with agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and promote the combination of supply, production, and sales contracts between each other. We must gradually link rural economic activities with the state's economic construction plan through these three forms of rural cooperation, gradually transform the small-scale peasant economy on the basis of production cooperation, and gradually transition to socialism.

    In order to realize the nation's general line and gradually transition to socialism, we must also carry out many arduous tasks. We must transform private industry and commerce and develop state capitalist economic forms. In 1953, the state capitalist economy, in which the state-owned economy and the private capitalist economy cooperated, has developed considerably. In 1954, we must further strengthen the leadership of the state capitalist economy, first consolidating the existing achievements on the original basis, and continue to expand the state capitalist economy according to possibilities and needs.

    In order to coordinate with national construction and meet the material needs of the people, we must also guide handicrafts to take the road of cooperation, so as to more effectively exert the role of handicrafts in the national economy.

    In order to raise the capital needed to build industry, the Central People's Government decided to issue national economic construction bonds in 1954, mobilizing the people of the whole country to use surplus and potentially saved funds to support national construction.

    In terms of culture and education, in the future, we must focus more on coordinating with national economic construction, cultivate construction talents in a planned way, appropriately improve the cultural level of the working people, further improve industrial and mining hygiene, and gradually pay attention to the development of rural health undertakings.

    While carrying out economic construction, we have also launched a nationwide general election movement since last year, electing representatives to the people's congresses of various cities and counties. As of the end of September last year, more than 3,500 townships and cities across the country have completed elections. It is expected that the county-level elections nationwide will be completed this spring, and then provincial and municipal people's congresses and the National People's Congress will be convened to make our country's system of people's democratic dictatorship more complete and more powerfully lead the people of the whole country to complete the great task of the First Five-Year Plan.

    The people of our country are willing to spare no effort to defend the construction of their motherland and to defend world peace. We have insisted on the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea in the past, forcing the US aggressors to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement and realizing the Korean armistice desired by the people of the world. Today, we must continue to resist US aggression and aid Korea until the United States accepts the convening of a political conference and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. On the basis of this victory that has already achieved the Korean armistice, the people of our country are even more confident in adhering to the peaceful policies of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and fighting for the settlement of international disputes and the easing of international tensions through peaceful consultation. The achievements we have already obtained in various aspects today are inseparable from the friendship and help of the socialist Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries to our country. The long-term, comprehensive, and huge assistance given by the Soviet government to our country's economic construction has greatly accelerated the speed of our country's industrialization. The gradually developing economic and cultural cooperation between our country and other fraternal countries also contributes to our country's prosperity. The achievements we have obtained are also inseparable from the struggle of the broad masses of people in all countries around the world to strive for lasting peace and oppose new war instigators. We must continue to strengthen and consolidate the strong unity with the peace-loving people of the world.

    In 1954, all international and domestic conditions are conducive to our construction and conducive to the implementation of our nation's general line. Therefore, as long as we are good at using various favorable conditions, overcome all difficulties, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, according to the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, work even harder to learn economic work, study the rich experience of Soviet socialist construction more deeply and systematically, concentrate all forces even more, and adhere to the policy of active construction and steady progress, we will certainly be able to strive for a greater victory of the nation's general line in 1954; we are fully confident that we can achieve greater victories on the road of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

    一切为了实现国家的总路线
    ——一九五四年元旦献辞
    一九五四年在我国过渡时期总路线已经得到巨大胜利的情况下来临，它无疑地将给我国五万万以上的人民带来更多更大的胜利。这个新的年度是我国第一个五年计划建设的第二年。我们将更加努力为完成国家的建设计划，为实现国家过渡时期的总路线，为进一步推进国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的事业而奋斗。
    过去的一年，全国人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的领导下团结努力，使国民经济在恢复的基础上有了进一步的发展，社会主义经济的比重继续增长，全国物价稳定，人民觉悟程度进一步提高，人民生活也有所改善，人民民主专政的制度更加巩固。这些重大的成就，给我国有计划的经济建设打下了坚实的基础。一九五四年我们就要在这个基础上，进一步贯彻国家总路线所规定的方针和具体政策，使国民经济的各个方面得到进一步的发展。
    在发展国民经济中，我们必须努力进一步建设社会主义的新工业，把现有的社会主义工业扩大起来，办得更好；我们必须努力对农业、手工业和私营工商业实行社会主义的改造。这两方面的任务必须紧密联系在一起。好比一只鸟，它要有一个主体，这就是发展社会主义的工业；它又要有一双翅膀，这就是对农业、手工业的改造和对私营工商业的改造。要过渡到社会主义，没有主体当然不行，没有翅膀也不行。我们必须使这两个方面的任务在一九五四年都有新的成就。虽然，我们懂得，要过渡到社会主义必须经过很长的时间，我们要逐年逐月地一步一步地往前走去，才能达到目的。我国从去年开始了第一个五年计划以后，成绩很大，广大人民对于国家总路线的认识更加明确，更加具体，大家都觉得有了“奔头”，这种政治觉悟的提高，使我们今天来迎接一九五四年的任务时更有信心。
    我们在一九五四年要完成的任务是巨大的。这任务是一定能够完成的。以一九五三年的成绩来做比较，我们就可以相信今年一定比去年更强。
    去年国家在基本建设方面的投资约占全部财政支出的三分之一，重要的建设项目有一百三十个，其中包括最近已经开工生产的我国第一个完全自动化的鞍山无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和七号炼铁炉。九条新的铁路和五千多公里的公路也已经施工。今年国家将进一步集中力量进行重工业的建设和铁路的建设，有比去年更多的基本建设项目列入了一九五四年的年度计划。这些建设是对我国工业化起决定作用的，是保证我国经济独立和国防安全、加强我国社会主义经济成分的领导作用、使我国经济不断上升并使人民生活逐步提高的基础。我们必须按照国家的计划，保证这些基本建设工作的完成。
    由于基本建设的迅速发展，今年将有近七十个新建和扩建完成了的工厂、矿山投入生产。其中包括有煤矿、发电厂、油矿、钢铁厂、有色金属矿、机器厂、纺织厂、造纸厂等等。这些工厂矿山的投入生产，就有可能使工业生产进一步提高，进一步满足国家建设和人民群众在生产上、生活上的需要。据初步计算，一九五三年全国国营、地方国营、公私合营及合作社营工业的总产值，预计可以完成国家计划的百分之一百零四，比一九五二年的工业总产值约增长百分之三十以上；在这个基础上，我们还必须使一九五四年的工业总产值，比一九五三年继续增长百分之十七左右。为了进一步达到工业增产的目的，我们还必须充分发挥国营工业和地方国营工业的设备效能，有步骤地调整旧有的工业，特别是机械工业和轻工业的设备，改进产品设计工作，增加新的品种，改进规格。要用最大努力去提高质量，降低成本，挖掘现有企业的潜在力，保证工业生产进一步的增长。
    对于工业发展的速度问题，我们必须有正确的认识。一方面，我们要看到：增产节约运动的结果，已使各工业部门的潜在力大大发挥出来，各部门一九五三年完成任务的数字比过去大大提高了，我们的计划也更逐步地接近于实际了。在这个基础上，如果要求过高，要按照原来的百分比继续增长，当然是不适当的。但在另一方面，我们又必须看到：现时我们的企业管理水平提高了，工人熟练的程度也提高了，新的厂矿日益加多地投入了生产，这就使工业增长的速度可以继续加强。因此，我们要想尽一切办法，利用一切可能利用的条件，保证必要的工业增长速度，而不应该有任何的保守思想。我们不要以为“潜力已经挖尽”，或者想“留一手”。这种保守思想是不利于国家、不利于人民的。根据实际的需要和可能，我国工业的增长速度，目前应该从三个主要方面努力加强：第一、在基本建设方面必须注意投资的效果，使新建和扩建的企业尽快投入生产，并对那些可以扩充与改建的原有企业适当地加以扩充与改建。第二、提高现有企业的管理水平，改善企业的生产技术管理；加强现有企业的技术组织措施；推广先进经验；特别是要努力推广带有决定意义的先进经验，以便把落后的企业提高到先进的水平，并使增产节约运动经常化起来。第三、无论基本建设或工业生产，都应该以最大的努力来实现各方面的配合和协作，互相帮助，互相推进，克服“一切只顾自己、万事不求别人”的孤立观点和分散主义现象。
    我们应该认识：发挥工人阶级最大的积极性和创造性，以无比的毅力去完成和超额完成工业生产和基本建设的计划，这是保证实现我们国家的建设计划、实现过渡时期总路线的决定环节。领导工业生产的部门和企业中的一切组织，从高级领导机关到基层单位，都应该动员一切力量，计算现有企业中的潜在力量，计算新建企业的生产能力，计算时间，计算速度，一步一步地去争取社会主义建设在我国的胜利。同时，也只有经过这样的努力，才能锻炼我们工人阶级自己，更有力量地去领导广大人民为实现国家总路线而奋斗。
    与工业的发展相适应，一九五四年在农业生产方面也提出了新的要求。去年的农业生产，虽然因为部分地区受灾，没有完成增产的计划；但是，去年我国粮食的总产量与一九五二年相比，还是不相上下。根据国家和人民的实际需要及农业生产方面可能的条件估计，一九五四年要求全国粮食总产量，比一九五三年的实际总产量还要增加上百亿斤的粮食，这是可以达到的。因为我国广大农民，受到了总路线的教育之后，对国家经济建设的计划和社会主义的道路产生了巨大的热情，政治觉悟进一步提高了，生产积极性也就随着提高，互助合作运动迅速发展，这些都是促进农业增产的有利条件。一九五三年全国组织起来的农户，已占农户总数百分之四十三；带有社会主义萌芽性质的农业互助组已有一千万个左右，半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，已近一万五千个。这种农业生产合作社可以成为引导农民过渡到更高级的完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社（集体农庄）的适当形式，它在目前整个互助合作运动中，日益显出重要的地位。根据全国各地的情况来看，现时的这种半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，由于农民的热烈要求和自愿组织起来，在一九五四年计划发展到三万五千八百个。这个计划是完全可能完成和超过的。我们必须努力领导农民办好农业生产合作社，并用这个方法带动农业互助组更普遍地发展起来。互助组是逐步引导农民实行社会主义改造的一种初级的形式，它们的发展是农业生产合作社发展的重要基础，因而我们也必须充分注意加强对它们的领导。
    除了农业生产互助合作之外，我们还应该积极举办农村供销合作和农村信用合作。这是农村合作社的三种形式，它们互相分工，又互相联系和互相促进。供销合作社和信用合作社能够帮助农民群众摆脱商业剥削、粮食囤积投机和高利贷的剥削，供应农民必需的生产资料和生活资料，为农村生产服务，促进农业生产互助合作的发展。供销合作社还必须进一步贯彻和农业互助组及农业生产合作社的联系，推广彼此之间供、产、销的结合合同。我们要通过农村合作化的这三种形式，逐步地把农村的经济活动和国家的经济建设计划联结起来，逐步地在生产合作的基础上改造小农经济，逐步地过渡到社会主义。
    为了实现国家的总路线，逐步过渡到社会主义，我们还要进行许多艰巨的工作。我们要改造私营工商业，发展国家资本主义的经济形式。一九五三年，国营经济和私人资本主义经济合作的国家资本主义经济，已有相当发展。在一九五四年，我们要进一步加强对国家资本主义经济的领导，首先是在原有的基础上巩固已有的成绩，并根据可能和需要，继续扩展国家资本主义经济。
    为了配合国家建设，满足人民群众物质的需要，我们也必须引导手工业走合作化的道路，以便更有效地发挥手工业在国家经济中的作用。
    为了筹集工业建设所需要的资金，中央人民政府决定在一九五四年发行国家经济建设公债，动员全国人民以多余的和可能节约的资金，来支援国家的建设。
    在文化教育方面，今后更要有重点地配合国家经济建设，有计划地培养建设人材，适当地提高劳动人民的文化水平，进一步改善工矿卫生并有步骤地注意农村卫生事业的开展。
    在进行经济建设的同时，我们从去年起在全国范围内展开了普选运动，选举各市、县的人民代表大会的代表。截至去年九月底止，全国已有三千五百多个乡镇和城市完成了选举。预计在今年春天，全国县一级的选举即可完成，以后将召开省、市人民代表大会及全国人民代表大会，使我国人民民主专政的制度更加完备，更有力地领导全国人民完成第一个五年计划建设的伟大任务。
    我国人民为了保卫自己祖国的建设，为了保卫世界和平，是不惜一切力量的。我们过去坚持抗美援朝斗争，使美国侵略者不得不在朝鲜停战协定上签字，使世界人民渴望的朝鲜停战实现了。今天我们仍然要继续抗美援朝，直到美国接受召开政治会议、和平解决朝鲜问题为止。在已经实现了朝鲜停战的这一胜利的基础上，我国人民更加信心百倍地坚持以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的和平政策，为争取以和平协商的方法解决国际争端、缓和国际紧张局势而斗争。我们今天所已经得到的各方面的成就，是和社会主义的苏联以及各人民民主国家对我国的友谊帮助分不开的。苏联政府给我国经济建设的长期的、全面的巨大援助，使我国工业化的速度大大加快。我国和其他兄弟国家正在逐步发展的经济和文化合作，也有助于我国的繁荣。我们所获得的成就，与全世界各国广大人民争取持久和平、反对新战争挑拨者的斗争，也是分不开的。我们必须继续加强和巩固与世界爱好和平人民的强大团结。
    在一九五四年，国际和国内的一切条件，都有利于我们的建设，有利于我们国家总路线的推行。因此，只要我们善于利用各种有利的条件，克服一切困难，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，按照毛泽东同志的指示，更加努力学会经济工作，更加深入和更有系统地学习苏联社会主义建设的丰富经验，更加集中一切力量，坚持积极建设、稳步前进的方针，我们就一定能够争取国家的总路线在一九五四年得到更大的胜利；我们就有充分的把握能够在社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的道路上获得更大的胜利。
