Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 26th: On January 14, 1954, Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC), decided to return the prisoners of war (POWs) under its custody to both sides of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and requested the Korean-Chinese side to take over the POWs in the northern POW camp before January 23rd. The Korean-Chinese side firmly opposed this, pointing out that this practice violated the Armistice Agreement and the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," and repeatedly requested the Indian Custodial Forces to continue guarding these POWs. However, the Indian Custodial Forces unilaterally ceased guarding these POWs at midnight on January 22, 1954.

Since the U.S. side has decided to abandon its explanatory work to these POWs, and the Indian forces have ceased guarding them, these POWs are requesting the Korean-Chinese side to grant them the right of residence. Based on humanitarian considerations, the Korean-Chinese Red Cross Societies have requested the Korean-Chinese side to jointly send personnel to the northern POW camp to receive these POWs and be responsible for obtaining the right of residence for them in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. The Korean-Chinese side sent a letter to Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on January 26 regarding this matter. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission:

I have the honor to extend my greetings to Your Excellency. Your Excellency sent letters to Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and myself on January 14 and 21, 1954, stating that Your Excellency has made a decision to return the POWs in the northern POW camp under the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian forces to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on January 20, 1954; If our side rejects this proposal, the Indian Custodial Forces will cease guarding the aforementioned POWs at midnight between January 22 and 23, 1954, and request the Korean-Chinese side to accept the re-guarding of the aforementioned POWs before midnight on January 22, 1954.

In response, Marshal Kim Il-sung, General Peng Dehuai, and myself successively replied to Your Excellency on January 19 and 22, 1954, expressing our clear position that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers cannot agree to accept the guarding of the POWs in the northern POW camp. At the same time, we believe that the Indian forces should not only not return but should also continue guarding these POWs.

Now, Your Excellency claims on January 23 that the Indian forces will leave Korea entirely in two weeks. However, the United Nations Command has refused to reach an agreement with the Korean-Chinese side on the issue of POWs at the Korean Military Armistice Commission, and the political conference that should make the final decision on the handling of POWs has failed to convene due to the obstructionist activities of the U.S. government. This situation puts the POWs in the northern POW camp in a difficult position. Since the United Nations Command has long abandoned their explanatory work to the small number of those among these POWs who have not been explained to, these POWs have publicly expressed to Your Excellency their unwillingness to be repatriated and requested the Korean-Chinese side to grant them the right of residence, according to their free will. Under these circumstances, the Korean Red Cross Society and the Chinese Red Cross Society have, based on humanitarian considerations, requested the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to jointly send personnel from the two Korean-Chinese Red Cross Societies to the northern POW camp to receive the 347 POWs after the Indian forces withdraw their guard, and be responsible for obtaining the right of residence for them in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China.

In order to relieve the difficulties of the POWs in the northern POW camp, and in order to reach a temporary arrangement with the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission regarding the handling of the aforementioned POWs, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have expressed their agreement to the request of the Korean Red Cross Society and the Chinese Red Cross Society. At the same time, the Korean-Chinese side wishes to point out that since the issue of POWs not directly repatriated has not been resolved in accordance with the basic goals and steps stipulated in the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," when the POW issue is raised for discussion at the political conference or other relevant international conferences stipulated in the Armistice Agreement, both parties to the Korean Armistice must provide a satisfactory explanation and reach a resolution on this issue. To this end, the Korean-Chinese side suggests that the Indian forces hand over the aforementioned 347 POWs, along with their lists, documents, and other items, to the Korean Red Cross Society and the Chinese Red Cross Society.

If the above temporary arrangement is agreed to by Your Excellency, the Korean Red Cross Society and the Chinese Red Cross Society will send personnel to the northern POW camp in the Korean Demilitarized Zone on January 28, 1954, to receive the 347 POWs, and receive them and their lists, documents, and other items from the Indian forces.

### 李相朝将军致函蒂迈雅将军  建议印军将北营战俘交给朝中红十字会

　　李相朝将军致函蒂迈雅将军
　　建议印军将北营战俘交给朝中红十字会
    【新华社开城二十六日电】一九五四年一月十四日，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将决定将其看管下的战俘交还朝鲜停战缔约的双方，并要求朝中方面在一月二十三日前接管北部战俘营的战俘。朝中方面对此坚决表示反对，指出：这种做法违反了停战协定与“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，并多次要求印度看管部队继续看管这些战俘。但印度看管部队于一九五四年一月二十二日午夜，片面停止了对这些战俘的看管。
    由于美方已决定放弃对这些战俘进行解释工作，而印度部队又停止了看管，这些战俘要求朝中方面给予居留的权利，朝中红十字会基于人道主义的考虑，已向朝中方面请求，由朝中红十字会联合派人前往北部战俘营迎接这些战俘，并负责为他们取得在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国居留的权利。朝中方面在一月二十六日就此致函中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将，该函全文如下：中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将：
    本人荣幸地向阁下致意。阁下于一九五四年一月十四日、二十一日先后致函朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅、中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军和本人，声明阁下已作出决定，准备于一九五四年一月二十日，将在中立国遣返委员会和印度部队看管下的北部战俘营中的战俘交还朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面；如果我方拒绝这一建议，则印度看管部队将于一九五四年一月二十二日与二十三日之间的午夜对上述战俘停止看管，并请求朝中方面于一九五四年一月二十二日午夜以前对上述战俘接受重新看管。
    对此，金日成元帅、彭德怀将军和本人先后于一九五四年一月十九日、二十二日复函阁下，表示了我方明确的立场，即：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面坚决不能同意接受看管北部战俘营中的战俘，同时，我方并认为印度部队不仅不应交还，并且还应继续看管这些战俘。
    现在，阁下在一月二十三日声称，印度部队将于两星期后全部离开朝鲜。但联合国军方面则已经拒绝在朝鲜军事停战委员会上与朝中方面就战俘处理问题取得协议，而应对战俘作出最后处理的政治会议又因美国政府的阻挠活动以致未能召开。这种情况使北部战俘营中的战俘处于困难境地。由于联合国军方面早已放弃他们对于这批战俘中少数未听解释的人的解释工作，因此，这批战俘已经根据其自由意愿公开地向阁下表示他们不愿遣返而要求朝中方面予以居留的权利。在这种情形之下，朝鲜红十字会和中国红十字会基于人道主义的考虑，已向朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面提出请求，由朝中两红十字会联合派人前往北部战俘营，迎接在印度部队撤离看管后的三百四十七名战俘，并负责为他们取得在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国居留的权利。
    为了解除北部战俘营中的战俘的困难，为了与中立国遣返委员会就上述战俘的处理问题取得临时安排，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面已对朝鲜红十字会和中国红十字会的请求表示同意。同时，朝中方面愿意指出，由于未予直接遣返的战俘问题未能按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所规定的基本目标和步骤取得解决，因此，当战俘问题在停战协定所规定的政治会议或其他有关国际会议上提出讨论时，朝鲜停战缔约双方必须就此项问题作出满意的交代和取得解决。为此，朝中方面建议印度部队将上述三百四十七名战俘连同他们的名册、证件及其他物品点交朝鲜红十字会和中国红十字会。
    如果上述临时安排获得阁下的同意，朝鲜红十字会和中国红十字会将派出人员于一九五四年一月二十八日前往朝鲜非军事区北部战俘营中，迎接三百四十七名战俘，并从印度部队点收他们及他们的名册、证件和其他物品。
