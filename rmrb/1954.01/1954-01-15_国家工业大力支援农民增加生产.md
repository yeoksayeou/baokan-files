    National Industry Vigorously Supports Farmers to Increase Production
    According to Xinhua News Agency, with the recovery and development of national industrial production, Chinese farmers have received tremendous help from national industrial production in their production over the past few years.
    According to statistics from 1950 to 1953, national industry supplied farmers nationwide with more than 600,000 new-style farm tools, more than 500,000 waterwheels, and a large number of bean cakes, chemical fertilizers, and pesticide equipment. In areas of the Northeast that used complete sets of new-style horse-drawn farm tools, coupled with other agricultural technology improvements, grain production generally increased by 25 to 30 percent compared to before, and in some cases, more than doubled. In North China, Northwest China, East China, and Central South China, statistics for eleven crops in nine provinces in 1951 showed that, on land with the same natural conditions, cultivation with new-style walking plows resulted in an average increase in production of 16.8 percent compared to cultivation with old-style walking plows.
    In 1953, in order to help farmers further organize and gradually implement mechanized production, the state selectively established eleven machine tractor stations in plain areas. These tractor stations were equipped with a total of 64 tractors and 303 agricultural machines, helping five collective farms, fifty-eight agricultural production cooperatives, thirty-nine mutual aid teams, nine local state-owned farms, and a small number of individual farmers with plowing and harvesting, which greatly increased production. Last year, the Beijing Machine Tractor Station cultivated more than 970 mu of cotton for the Red Star Collective Farm, with an average increase of 50 percent per mu compared to 1952. The Northeast Huachuan Tractor Station cultivated 3,060 mu of rice for the Xinghuo Collective Farm, which achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year, with an average yield of over 800 jin of rice per mu, more than double the yield of ordinary farmers.
    In terms of national industrial production assisting farmers in fighting pests and diseases, statistics from the past four years show that it has supplied farmers nationwide with more than 67 million jin of various pesticides and more than 520,000 sprayers. In 1952, cotton pests and diseases were widespread in China's cotton-growing areas. Thanks to the large supply of cotton pesticides and sprayers by national industrial production, farmers were helped to recover the loss of more than 1.5 million dan of ginned cotton, equivalent to more than 1.5 trillion yuan in Renminbi. In 1953, thanks to the improvement of locust control technology in various regions and the large-scale supply of "666" powder by national industry, the policy of using pesticides as the main method of locust control was adopted in areas where locusts occurred nationwide. Before the locust nymphs emerged from the soil, the state transported more than 11 million jin of "666" powder, more than 1 million jin of wheat bran for poison bait, and more than 14,000 dusters to the main locust areas, which not only shortened the locust control time but also saved a lot of manpower. Last year, the government also dispatched aircraft to carry out aerial locust control in the Weishan Lake area of Jiangsu Province, saving farmers in the area 500,000 labor days, totaling 2 billion yuan at a rate of 4,000 yuan per workday.
    In the past four years, more than 250 large-scale water conservancy projects and more than 4 million small-scale water conservancy projects have been built across the country, with more than 800,000 wells drilled and more than 30,000 horsepower of water pumps added. These projects have expanded the irrigated area by more than 54 million mu in total. Rice paddies that originally yielded one harvest a year can now yield two harvests; those that originally yielded two harvests can now yield three harvests. Therefore, grain production has greatly increased in areas where water conservancy projects have been built, reducing water and drought disasters for farmers in those areas. For example, China's great Huai River harnessing project has enabled farmers on both banks of the Huai River to initially eliminate the threat of Huai River floods to their lives and property for more than 700 years in the past three years. Last year, crops in many areas on both banks of the Huai River achieved bumper harvests. The completion of the Yellow River Irrigation Project in Henan Province enabled more than 700,000 mu of water-deficient farmland in six counties including Xinxiang and Huojia on both sides of the Beijing-Hankou Railway to be irrigated in time, and enabled the Wei River waterway from Xinxiang to Tianjin, more than 900 kilometers long, to be navigable. These great water conservancy projects would have been difficult to complete with only the hands of farmers and backward tools without the support of national industry. According to statistics from East China, in recent years, heavy industrial factories in Shanghai and other parts of East China have manufactured a large number of machines and equipment for water conservancy construction, supplying the needs of the Huai River harnessing project and other large-scale water conservancy projects.
    In addition, in some areas, the people's government has used the favorable conditions of being close to cities and industrial and mining areas to help farmers implement electric irrigation. For example, in the Jin-Gu area in eastern Hebei Province, many areas were previously uncultivated saline-alkali wasteland. In the past four years, the people's government has used the increased power supply from Tianjin and Tangshan to establish 37 electric pumping stations here, increasing the area of land irrigated by electric pumping from the original 90,000 mu to 220,000 mu. Electric irrigation has played a significant role in the development of local agricultural production. In 1953, rice paddies irrigated by electricity yielded nearly 700 jin of rice per mu on average, and many high-yield fields yielding more than 1,000 jin appeared.
    In view of the great help of national industrial production to agricultural production, farmers in various regions are currently studying the general line of the state during the transition period with a hundredfold increase in enthusiasm, selling surplus grain to the state, and further developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, striving to increase production of more grain and industrial raw materials to support the country's industrial construction.

    国家工业大力支援农民增加生产
    据新华社讯：我国农民随着国家工业生产的恢复和发展，几年来，在生产方面已得到国家工业生产的巨大帮助。
    据一九五零年到一九五三年的统计，国家工业供给了全国农民六十多万部新式农具，五十多万辆水车；还有大量的豆饼、化学肥料和农药器械。东北区在使用成套的新式马拉农具的地方，加上其他农业技术的改进，粮食产量普遍较前增加了百分之二十五到三十，有的甚至增加了一倍多。华北、西北、华东、中南一九五一年九个省十一种农作物的统计，在同样自然条件的土地上，用新式步犁耕作比用旧式步犁耕作，平均增产百分之十六点八。
    一九五三年，国家为了帮助农民进一步组织起来，逐步实行机械化生产，在平原地区有重点地建立了十一个机器拖拉机站。这些拖拉机站共配备了六十四台拖拉机、三百零三台农业机器，帮助五个集体农庄、五十八个农业生产合作社、三十九个互助组、九个地方国营农场和少数单干农民耕种和收获，使生产大大增加。北京机器拖拉机站去年为红星集体农庄耕种的九百七十多亩棉花，平均每亩即比一九五二年增产百分之五十。东北桦川拖拉机站为星火集体农庄耕种的三千零六十亩水稻，去年得到了空前丰收，每亩稻谷产量平均达到八百斤以上，比一般农民的产量高出一倍。
    国家工业生产在帮助农民和病虫害斗争方面，据最近四年来的统计，供给了全国农民各种农药六千七百多万斤，喷雾器五十二万多架。一九五二年，我国棉区棉花普遍发生病虫害，由于国家工业生产供给了农民大量的棉虫药剂和喷雾器，帮助农民挽回了一百五十多万担皮棉的损失，折合人民币一万五千多亿元。一九五三年，由于各地治蝗技术的提高和国家工业大量供应了“六六六”药粉，在全国发生蝗虫的地区采取药剂为主的治蝗方针，蝗蝻未出土前，国家就把一千一百多万斤“六六六”药粉、一百多万斤毒饵用的麦麸和一万四千多架喷粉器运到各主要蝗区，不仅缩短了治蝗时间，而且节省了大量人力。去年，政府还派遣飞机在江苏省微山湖地区进行了飞机治蝗。为该区农民节省了五十万个劳动日；以每工四千元计，共达二十亿元。
    四年来，全国兴修了大的水利工程二百五十多处，小的水利工程四百多万处，凿井八十多万眼，抽水机增加了三万多匹马力。这些工程总共扩大了浇地面积五千四百多万亩，原来一年收一次的水稻田，现在能收两次了；原来能收两次的，现在能收到三次。因此兴修水利的地区，粮食产量都大大增加，使各该地区农民减轻了水旱灾害。如我国的伟大治淮工程，三年来已使淮河两岸的农民，初步消除了七百多年来淮河洪水对他们生命财产的威胁，去年淮河两岸很多地区的农作物获得了丰收。河南省引黄灌溉济卫工程的完成，使京汉铁路两侧的新乡、获嘉等六县的七十余万亩缺水农田得到了及时灌溉，并使新乡到天津九百多公里的卫河航运得以畅通。这些伟大的水利工程，如果没有国家工业的支援，只凭农民的双手和落后工具是难以完成的。据华东的统计，几年来上海和华东各地的重工业工厂，就制造了大批为水利建设用的机械和器材，供应了治淮工程和其他大型水利工程的需要。
    另外，在部分地区，人民政府利用靠近城市和工矿区的有利条件，帮助农民实行电力灌溉。如河北省东部的津沽地区，过去不少是未曾开垦的盐碱荒地，四年来人民政府利用天津、唐山电力增加的条件，在这里建立了三十七处电力扬水站，使电力扬水灌溉的土地面积由原来的九万亩增加到二十二万亩。电力灌溉对当地农业生产的发展起了重大作用。一九五三年用电力灌溉的稻田，平均每亩收获稻谷近七百斤，并出现了不少千斤以上的丰产田。
    鉴于国家工业生产对农业生产的巨大帮助，目前各地农民在学习国家过渡时期的总路线中，以百倍高涨的热情，出卖余粮给国家，并进一步发展互助合作运动，争取增产更多的粮食和工业原料，支援国家的工业建设。
