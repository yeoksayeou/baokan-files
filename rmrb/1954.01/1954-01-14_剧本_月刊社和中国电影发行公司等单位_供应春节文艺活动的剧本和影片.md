"Drama" Monthly and China Film Distribution Company and Other Units
Supply Scripts and Films for Spring Festival Cultural Activities
    The "Instructions on Carrying Out Spring Festival Rural Cultural Activities to Propagandize the General Line to Farmers," issued by the Ministry of Culture on December 10th of last year, required relevant units to do a good job in supplying materials for Spring Festival propaganda. "Drama" Monthly, China Film Distribution Company, China Slide Company, and other units have prepared and compiled small scripts, films, slides, and other materials suitable for Spring Festival propaganda for use in various regions.
    The January 1954 issue of "Drama" Monthly has published five small scripts propagandizing the general line, for professional and amateur theatrical troupes to choose from for performance or adaptation into various opera forms. Scripts depicting the struggle between the two roads in rural areas include "People Strive to Go Higher" and "Seedlings Compete to Grow." "People Strive to Go Higher" describes a new middle peasant who, during the development of mutual aid teams towards agricultural production cooperatives, wants to get rich on his own and take the capitalist road. He encounters deception by rural capitalist elements and suffers from natural disasters that individual peasant strength cannot resist. He finally awakens and joins the agricultural production cooperative. This script demonstrates the powerful collective strength of agricultural production cooperatives and that only collectivization is the correct path to guide farmers towards prosperity. "Seedlings Compete to Grow" focuses on exposing a wealthy peasant's plot to harm honest farmers and poor households. The script "After the Rain," which depicts new rural life and new characters, enthusiastically praises the growth of farmers' collectivist thinking. The script "Moon Bay," through the events of brewing candidates in the general election work, depicts the struggle between mutual aid and cooperation thinking and individual selfish and self-interested thinking among peasants. The script "Grain," which describes the grain issue, publicizes the country's grain policy during the construction period through the exposure of a grain merchant's criminal behavior in undermining the grain policy.
    China Film Distribution Company has prepared twelve films. Among them are "Light Shines on the Highland Village" (originally "Light Shines on Keordi Village") and "The Road to Collectivization" (originally "Virgin Soil Upturned"), which depict the implementation of agricultural collectivization in Estonia and the Soviet Union. There are also the domestic feature film "Harvest" and the documentary "Agricultural Production Cooperative," which depict how an agricultural production cooperative overcomes difficulties and strives for a bumper harvest under the leadership of the Party and the government. There are also the large-scale documentaries "Great Land Reform," "Resist America, Aid Korea, Series II," the documentary film "The Visit of the Chinese Peasants Delegation to the Soviet Union," which documents the visit of the Chinese peasants delegation to the Soviet Union, and the documentaries "Spark Collective Farm," "National Day of 1953," and "Folk Song and Dance." The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio has also specially rushed to produce two films propagandizing the general line: the documentary "Where Does a Good Life Come From," which promotes agricultural collectivization, and "Many Benefits of Developing Industry," which introduces the situation of industrial construction in our country to farmers. With the exception of the two films "Where Does a Good Life Come From" and "Many Benefits of Developing Industry," which will not be available until February, the remaining ten films can be sent to factories, mines, and rural areas across the country in January for screening during the Spring Festival.
    China Slide Company has prepared a total of ten slide shows. Among them are six feature films: "Spark Collective Farm," "Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative," "The Road to Happiness," "Wang Xiulan Leads the Mutual Aid Team," "Conservative Thinking is Undesirable," and "Granny Wang Attends the Fair"; there are four photographs: "A Collective Farm in Siberia," "Stalin Machine Manufacturing Plant," "Anshan Iron and Steel," and "The First Year of the Motherland's Five-Year Construction Plan." All ten of the above slide shows have now been distributed.
    In addition, popular literary and art publications in various regions have also published or will publish storytelling materials and songs for propagandizing the general line to farmers during Spring Festival cultural activities.

    中央文化部去年十二月十日发布的“关于开展春节农村文艺活动向农民宣传总路线的指示”中，曾要求各有关单位做好春节宣传的资料供应工作。“剧本”月刊社、中国电影发行公司、中国幻灯公司等单位已准备和编印了适合春节宣传的小型剧本、影片、幻灯片等资料，供各地采用。

    中国电影发行公司准备了十二部影片。其中有描写爱沙尼亚和苏联实行农业集体化的影片“光明照到高地村”（原名“光明照耀到克奥尔地村”）和“走向集体化的道路”（原名“被开垦的处女地”），有描写一个农业生产合作社怎样在党和政府领导下克服困难争取丰收的国产故事片“丰收”和纪录片“农业生产合作社”，有大型纪录片“伟大的土地改革”、“抗美援朝第二辑”，有我国农民代表团访问苏联的纪录影片“中国农民代表团访苏经过”，有纪录片“星火集体农庄”、“一九五三年国庆节”和“民间歌舞”。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂并特为赶制出两部宣传总路线的影片：宣传农业集体化的纪录片“好日子哪里来”和向农民介绍我国工业建设情况的“发展工业好处多”。以上十二部影片除“好日子哪里来”和“发展工业好处多”两影片需待二月份始能发出外，其余十部影片在一月份就可以发往全国各地工矿农村，在春节期间放映。
    中国幻灯公司共准备了十部幻灯片。其中六部故事片：“星火集体农庄”、“耿长锁农业生产合作社”、“走向幸福的道路”、“王秀兰领导互助组”、“保守思想要不得”、“王大娘赶会”；有四部照片“西伯利亚的一个集体农庄”、“斯大林机器制造厂”、“鞍钢”、“祖国五年建设的第一年”。以上十部幻灯片，现已发行。
