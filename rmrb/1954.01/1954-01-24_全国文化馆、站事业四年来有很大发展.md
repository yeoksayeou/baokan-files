National cultural centers and stations have greatly developed in the past four years. By the end of 1953, there were approximately 2,470 cultural centers, 4,560 cultural stations, and 18 mobile cultural service teams nationwide. These cultural centers, stations, and service teams were distributed across provinces, cities, counties, towns, districts, townships, and remote ethnic minority areas throughout the country.

These cultural centers and stations are grassroots cultural work strongholds that regularly connect with the broad masses. Over the past four years, in coordination with the land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, patriotic production increase campaigns, patriotic health campaigns, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the general election, the promotion of the Marriage Law, the defense of world peace, and the Sino-Soviet friendship movement, cultural centers and stations have conducted extensive cultural promotion and educational activities for the vast urban and rural working people through the screening of slides, holding various exhibitions and lectures, organizing blackboard newspapers, reading groups, radio broadcasts, performances by amateur worker-peasant theatrical troupes, the circulation and reading of popular books and periodicals, and various cultural and technical learning activities for the masses. According to statistics from July to September 1952, approximately 6,000 cultural centers and stations nationwide screened slides over 90,000 times, with an audience of over 47 million people; held over 20,000 various exhibitions, with an audience of over 56 million people; held over 148,000 lectures, reports, and symposiums on various topics, with an audience of over 46 million people; and had approximately 20 million readers of books and newspapers. In addition, they were in contact with over 70,000 rural and factory amateur theatrical troupes, regularly guiding their cultural and recreational activities; and jointly with relevant units, they held a large number of literacy classes and study groups, providing various cultural and technical knowledge education to the vast urban and rural working masses. According to statistics from Sichuan Province from January to March 1953 alone, the province's 135 cultural centers held a total of 7,220 various study classes, with nearly 460,000 students participating in the learning. These activities have played an important role in promoting the Party and government's various policies, enhancing the political awareness and labor enthusiasm of the people, and enlivening and enriching the cultural life of urban and rural areas, especially the rural working people.

Many cultural centers and stations are warmly welcomed and supported by local governments and people because their work is closely integrated with production and the central tasks of each period, and closely integrated with the needs of the masses. For example, the Shuangliu County Cultural Center in Sichuan Province, during the promotion of the mud-water seed selection method, used the method of holding mobile production exhibitions to promote the benefits of the mud-water seed selection method with concrete examples, and taught the visiting farmers the method of mud-water seed selection, which played a great role in promoting the new method of seed selection locally. The Zou Houlin mutual aid team in Baishi Township, Ziyang County, Sichuan Province, originally planned to use only four mu of land to test the sparse seedling dense planting method. After the district cultural station cooperated with the agricultural technology guidance station to promote it by showing slides, all 19 mu of the team's land, except for five fen of land using the # shape seedling method, adopted the sparse seedling dense planting method, and automatically increased the original plan of 11 mu of high-yield land to 13 mu. The director of the Xishan District Cultural Center in Kunming, Yunnan Province, would first visit farmers, work with them, and understand their needs whenever he went to work in rural areas, and then make his own slides and prepare various materials for activities. His working methods and work style are very popular among farmers.

The Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the work of cultural centers. In 1953, some provincial and municipal Party committees focused on discussing the work of cultural centers at propaganda conferences and made corresponding arrangements. The Propaganda Department of the Guanghan County Party Committee of Sichuan Province also clearly stipulated that the cultural center and propaganda network should be regarded as the two most important tools of the county's Party propaganda work. The director of the County Party Committee Propaganda Department directly led and regularly arranged the work of the cultural center, and the work plan of the cultural center was brought to the department's affairs meeting for discussion and listed as part of the county's propaganda work plan.

In order to consolidate the work achievements of cultural centers and stations, and further strengthen and improve the work of cultural centers and stations, many regions convened professional conferences on the work of cultural centers and stations in 1953, and adopted the method of short-term rotational training to train 5,000 cultural center and station cadres. Recently, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government also summarized the work of cultural centers and stations over the past four years, and issued the "Instructions on Consolidating and Strengthening the Work of Cultural Centers and Stations," which further clarified the nature, principles, tasks, and other related issues of cultural centers and stations. At present, cultural centers and stations in various regions are actively promoting the general line of the country during the transition period in accordance with the "Instructions of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government on Carrying out Rural Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Activities to Publicize the General Line to Farmers," using slides, pictures, and guiding various local mass amateur cultural and recreational organizations.

    全国文化馆、站事业四年来有很大发展
    全国文化馆和文化站事业，四年来有很大发展。至一九五三年年底为止，全国约有二千四百七十个文化馆、四千五百六十个文化站和十八个流动的文化服务队，这些文化馆、站和服务队分布在全国各省、市、县、镇、区、乡和边远少数民族地区。
    这些文化馆、站是经常联系广大群众的基层文化工作据点。四年来，文化馆、站配合土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝、爱国增产和爱国卫生、“三反”“五反”、普选、宣传婚姻法、保卫世界和平和中苏友好各项运动，通过放映幻灯，举办各种展览、讲演，组织黑板报、读报组、广播收音、工农业余剧团的演出、通俗书刊的流通阅览以及群众的各种文化技术学习，对广大城乡劳动人民做了广泛的文化宣传和教育的活动。据一九五二年七月至九月三个月的统计，全国约六千个文化馆、站共放映幻灯九万多场，观众四千七百多万人；举办各种展览二万多次，观众五千六百多万人；举办各种内容的讲演、报告和座谈会十四万八千多次，听众四千六百多万人；阅览书报的约二千万人。此外，并联系着七万多个农村和工厂业余剧团，经常辅导他们的文化娱乐活动；和各有关单位联合举办了大量的识字班、学习班，对广大城乡劳动群众进行了各种文化和技术知识的教育。仅据四川省一九五三年一至三月的统计，全省一百三十五个文化馆共举办各种学习班七千二百二十班，参加学习的学员近四十六万人。以上这些活动，对于宣传党和政府的各项政策，提高人民群众的政治觉悟和劳动热情，活跃和丰富城乡特别是农村劳动人民的文化生活，起了重要的作用。
    许多文化馆、站，由于他们的工作密切和生产以及各个时期的中心任务相结合，与群众的需要密切相结合，受到当地政府和人民群众的热烈欢迎和支持。如四川省双流县文化馆，在当地推行泥水选种法的期间，用举办流动的生产展览会的办法，用具体事例宣传泥水选种法的好处，并教给参观的农民泥水选种的方法，对当地推行新法选种起了很大作用。四川省资阳县白石乡邹厚林互助组，原计划只用四亩田试用少秧密植法，经区文化站配合农业技术指导站放映幻灯进行宣传后，全组十九亩田除五分田用井字秧外，全部采用少秧密植的方法，并自动将原十一亩丰产田的计划增为十三亩。云南省昆明西山区文化馆馆长每到农村工作，先访问农民，和农民一起做活，了解他们的需要，然后再自制幻灯片、准备各种材料进行活动。他的这种工作方法和工作作风，很受农民们欢迎。
    中共各地党委对文化馆的工作都很重视。一九五三年内，有些省、市党委曾在宣传会议上，着重讨论了文化馆的工作，并作了相应的布置。中共四川省广汉县委宣传部并明确规定把文化馆和宣传网作为该县党的宣传工作的两个最重要的工具，县委宣传部部长直接领导并经常布置文化馆的工作，文化馆的工作计划，都提到宣传部的部务会议上讨论，列为全县宣传工作计划的一部分。
    为了巩固文化馆、站的工作成绩，进一步加强和提高文化馆、站的工作，一九五三年内许多地区都召开了文化馆、站工作的专业会议，并采取短期轮训的方法，训练了五千个文化馆、站干部。最近，中央人民政府文化部并总结了四年来文化馆、站的工作，发布了“关于整顿和加强文化馆、站工作的指示”，对文化馆、站的性质、方针、任务及其他有关问题，作了进一步的明确的规定。现各地文化馆、站正按照中央人民政府文化部“关于开展春节农村文艺活动向农民宣传总路线的指示”，运用幻灯片、图片和辅导当地各种群众业余文娱组织，积极宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线。
