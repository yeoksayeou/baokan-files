    Correct Cadres' Impatience, Deepen the Publicity of the General Line
    Hezi Village Farmers in Weichang County Eagerly Sell Surplus Grain
    Shen Yue, Second Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, went deep into Hezi Village, Weichang County, to inspect work. He corrected the cadres' impatience and simplistic working methods, and led the local work team to thoroughly educate farmers on the general line for the transition period and the state's grain purchase policy. This dispelled the farmers' ideological doubts, and the amount of surplus grain farmers volunteered to sell increased from 50,000 jin to 270,000 jin.
    The work team sent by the Weichang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Weichang County People's Government to Hezi Village did not study the relevant documents well before setting out. Therefore, when conducting publicity, they did not explain the policy deeply or thoroughly, and their explanations were empty and hollow. Their working methods were also very simplistic. After two days of publicity, they impatiently mobilized farmers to sell grain, causing ideological confusion among the masses. The thoughts of party members and village cadres were also not straightened out, and farmers were observing each other, unwilling to sell surplus grain. As a result, the entire village only volunteered to sell 50,000 jin of grain.
    After discovering the above problems, Shen Yue, Second Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, immediately personally led the cadres in the village to study the general line and grain purchase policies, and researched and improved working methods. After studying the documents, the work team cadres improved their ideological understanding and vigorously promoted the general line and grain purchase policies among the masses. They used the method of carefully calculating accounts and vivid examples to publicize the benefits of national industrialization to farmers; they used the contrast between the past poverty-stricken lives of local farmers under the oppression and exploitation of landlords, rich peasants, and usurers and the current rising situation of cooperative economic life to educate them on the two roads, promote socialism, and arouse the farmers' hatred of the old society and their hope for a socialist society. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses rose, and many people said, "Before, we only talked about industrialization, and we didn't understand it. Now, after this detailed calculation, it's all clear!" An old woman in her sixties went around telling women, "We used to have little food and clothing, and people in the village starved to death. Now we have food and clothing. Look at what we wear and use, which one doesn't come from the state factory!" The work team further proceeded from production and publicized the benefits of expanding reproduction after farmers sold grain and the preferential treatment of grain sale savings by the bank. This made the farmers realize that the state's grain purchase not only conformed to the long-term interests of the farmers, but also to their immediate interests.
    After these tasks were done well, the farmers' ideological awareness was raised, and they all used the practical action of selling surplus grain to support the general line. The village head of Hezi Village only volunteered to sell 3,000 jin the first time, but this time he reported 13,000 jin; Sun Cai, who had more surplus grain, only reported 500 jin before, but this time he reported 6,000 jin. The total amount of grain that farmers originally volunteered to sell in the village was 50,000 jin, but now it has increased to 270,000 jin. The farmers are in high spirits to expand production after selling grain, some have already started buying carts and horses, and sideline production has been initially developed.

    纠正干部急躁情绪深入宣传总路线
    围场县合字村农民踊跃出卖余粮
    中共热河省委第二书记沈越深入围场县合字村检查工作，纠正了干部的急躁情绪和简单化的工作方法，领导当地工作组深入向农民进行国家过渡时期总路线和国家购粮政策的教育，解除了农民思想上的疑虑，农民自报出卖余粮数由五万斤增加到二十七万斤。
    中共围场县委会和围场县人民政府派赴合字村进行工作的工作组，在出发前没有很好学习文件。因此，进行宣传时，讲的不深不透，空空洞洞。工作方法又非常简单，宣传了两天后，就急躁地发动农民卖粮，引起群众思想混乱。党员、村干部的思想也没有搞通，农民更是互相观望，不愿出卖余粮，结果全村只自报卖粮五万斤。
    中共热河省委第二书记沈越发现上述问题后，立即在该村亲自领导干部学习总路线和购粮政策，研究改进工作方法。工作组干部学习文件后，思想认识提高了，在群众中大张旗鼓地展开总路线和购粮政策的宣传。他们用算细账的方法，用生动的实例宣传了国家工业化对农民的好处；用当地农民过去在地主、富农和高利贷者的压迫剥削下的贫困生活和目前进行互助合作经济生活上升的情况，对比地进行两条道路的教育，宣传社会主义，唤起农民对旧社会的痛恨和对社会主义社会的希望。结果群众情绪高涨，许多人“以前只讲工业化，咱们不懂，现在这一算细账就解开了！”一位六十多岁的老太太到处向妇女说：“咱们过去少吃没穿，村里饿死过人，现在咱们有吃有穿。看看咱们穿的盖的，哪件不是从国家工厂来的！”工作组又进一步从生产出发，宣传农民卖粮后扩大再生产的好处和银行优待售粮储蓄的办法。这样就使农民认识了国家购粮不仅符合农民的长远利益，也符合农民的眼前利益。
    经过作好这些工作，农民思想觉悟提高，都用出售余粮的实际行动来拥护总路线。合字村村长在第一次只自报卖粮三千斤，这次报了一万三千斤；余粮较多的孙财，以前只报了五百斤，这次报了六千斤。全村农民原来自报卖粮五万斤，现在增加到二十七万斤。农民卖粮后扩大生产的情绪很高，有的已开始拴车买马，副业生产已初步开展。
