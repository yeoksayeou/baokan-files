Selling Surplus Grain to Expand Production
    Sun Zunian

    The peasants of Xiaoliu Village Township in the Sixth District of Ningjin County, Hebei Province, enthusiastically sold 251,300 jin of surplus grain, receiving 216 million yuan in Renminbi. Many peasants, upon receiving the money, didn't know what to do with it. They were afraid of losing it if they kept it on their person, and afraid of spending it all little by little. As a result, all sorts of ideas emerged: young peasants advocated buying bicycles and flashlights, women advocated buying cloth to make clothes, and older peasants advocated buying something good to eat. Conflicting opinions remained unresolved.

    These thoughts quickly reached the township's Party branch. The branch secretary, Liu Fushun, felt that the peasants' thinking was wrong. He couldn't rest easy, fearing that the peasants would waste the money from selling surplus grain, so he immediately convened a Party branch committee meeting to discuss it. After deciding on a plan, each committee member went to the Party groups to convey it. Afterward, the Party groups, in coordination with the administrative group leaders, convened mass meetings of each group to enthusiastically discuss the issue of how to expand reproduction after selling surplus grain. Initially, some peasants couldn't understand, so the Party member cadres in each group took the lead in expressing their opinions, explaining that selling surplus grain was to support national industrial construction, stabilize prices, and ensure that everyone had food and clothing. Only with the development of national industry can agriculture be mechanized and agricultural output further increased. The money peasants earned from selling surplus grain today shouldn't be wasted. First, it should be invested in reproduction, acquiring necessary clothing and items, and the money not urgently needed should be deposited in the bank. In this way, with the joint efforts of the state and the peasants, the peasants can truly live a prosperous life. After clarifying these principles, the peasants were happy to accept them.

    After resolving these ideological issues, the entire township formulated a plan for investing the money earned from selling surplus grain into production: 50 percent would be used to purchase farm tools, livestock, and fertilizer, 30 percent would be deposited in the bank, and the remaining 20 percent would be used to purchase necessities and repair collapsed houses. The township supply and marketing cooperative also fully prepared material supplies based on the peasants' production needs. After the grain purchase was completed, the sales volume of plows, hoes, iron pots, oil, salt, matches, and cloth in the supply and marketing cooperative doubled compared to the past. The Ningjin branch of the People's Bank also went to the township to hold market days and handle peasants' savings work. Now the peasants have saved more than 20 million yuan. Many peasants reflected: "The supply and marketing cooperative and the People's Bank are both serving us. Farm tools and other goods are delivered to our doorsteps, and the bank has moved to our village. Not only is it very convenient, but from now on, we will no longer be exploited by speculators."

    With a production plan in place for the entire township and the supply and marketing cooperative fully prepared, the peasants are now acting in an organized manner. Farmers in groups of two or three are going to nearby Xinhe County and surrounding markets to buy livestock and farm tools. The entire township has bought 24 oxen and 23 plows, mouldboards and harrows. Peasant Zhang Baozhen sold 500 jin of surplus grain and, together with two other families, spent 1.57 million yuan to buy an ox, plowing more than ten mu of winter farmland in three days. He also organized a mutual aid group with Youth League member Guo Yuejuan, peasant Han Xiaoma, and five other households, and in two days, they plowed all 19 mu of cotton fields in the group, and all the cotton stalks were hauled back. Peasant Xia Laojin sold 3,000 jin of surplus grain, deposited 1.2 million yuan in the bank, and bought a small donkey to pull a waterwheel for irrigation. Many other peasants are using the money from selling surplus grain to buy iron nails, iron rakes, and wood to repair carts, and are carrying out a winter manure accumulation campaign with "three diligences and four cleanlinesses." The three diligences are diligent sweeping of the courtyard, diligent bedding of the pen, and diligent cleaning of the pen. The four cleanlinesses are cleanliness inside the house, cleanliness in the yard, cleanliness in the livestock pen, and cleanliness on the threshing floor. The entire township has accumulated tens of thousands of jin of fertilizer. Ma Genlu accumulated some surplus grain this year. During the grain purchase, the couple had a fight. After they understood the general line of the country during the transition period and the benefits of the state's grain purchase for the peasants, they also enthusiastically sold 1,000 jin of surplus grain. The peasants of Xiaoliu Village Township, after selling surplus grain, are expanding production and working hard to strive for a better harvest this year.

    卖余粮扩大生产
    孙祖年
    河北省宁晋县六区小刘村乡的农民，踊跃地卖出了二十五万一千三百斤余粮，得人民币二亿一千六百万元。很多农民拿到钱不知道如何是好，放在身上怕丢了，又怕零敲碎打地用光了。因此，各种各样的想法就出来啦：青年农民主张买自行车、手电筒，妇女主张买布做衣服，年老的农民主张买点好的吃吃。不同的意见始终统一不起来。
    这些思想很快地反映到乡的党支部，支部书记刘福顺觉得农民这种思想不对头。他怎么也放心不下，怕农民把卖余粮的钱乱花了，就立即召开党的支委会讨论。决定办法后，各支委又分头到党小组传达。过后，党小组配合行政小组长召开各组的群众大会，热烈地讨论了卖余粮后如何扩大再生产的问题。开始有些农民还想不通，这时，在各组的党员干部就带头发表起意见来了。说明卖余粮是为了支援国家工业建设，稳定物价，保障人人有饭吃，有衣穿。只有国家工业发展了，农业才能机械化，才能更高地提高农业产量。农民今天卖出余粮的钱就不能乱花，首先要投入再生产，置些必要的衣、物等，把目前不急需用的钱就存到银行里去。这样，国家与农民一齐努力，农民才能真正的过富裕的生活。把这些道理一讲清，农民都乐意地接受了。
    解决了这些思想问题后，全乡将卖余粮得到的钱订出了投入生产的计划：以百分之五十购买农具、牲口、肥料，百分之三十存到银行里去，下剩百分之二十购买必需品和修理倒塌的房屋。乡供销合作社也根据农民生产上的需要充分的做好了物资供应。购粮结束后，供销合作社的犁、锄头、铁锅、油、盐、火柴、布匹销售量较过去增加了一倍。人民银行宁晋支行也下到这乡赶集，办理农民的储蓄工作，现在农民已储蓄二千余万元。很多农民反映：“供销合作社、人民银行都在为我们服务，农具等货物送上了门，银行搬到咱村，不但很方便，从此再也不受投机商人的剥削了。”
    全乡有了生产计划，供销合作社也做了充分准备，现在农民已有组织地行动起来了，三三两两合伙的农民到附近的新河县和周围的集上购买牲畜和农具，全乡已买耕牛二十四头，犁、铧、耙二十三件。农民张保振卖了五百斤余粮，三家合伙共用一百五十七万元买了一头牛，三天就把十多亩冬耕地翻过来，又和青年团员郭月娟，农民韩小马等七户组织了一个互助组，两天时间就把全组十九亩棉花地耕了一遍，棉花秸也全部拉回来。农民夏老金卖了三千斤余粮，存了一百二十万元在银行，又买了一头小毛驴拉水车浇地。还有不少农民拿卖余粮的钱买铁钉、铁钯、木料修整大车，开展了三勤四光冬季积肥运动。三勤就是勤扫院，勤垫圈，勤出圈。四光是屋里光，院里光，牲口圈里光和场上光。全乡积肥已上万斤。马根路今年积存了一部分余粮。在购粮当中，夫妇俩曾打过一架，当他俩懂得了国家过渡时期的总路线和国家收购粮食对农民的好处后，也踊跃地卖了一千斤余粮。卖余粮后的小刘村乡的农民，正在扩大生产，为争取今年更好的收成而辛勤地劳动着。
