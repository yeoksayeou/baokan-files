　　National construction undertakings develop, people's living standards improve.
　　Sales of State-Owned Light Industrial Products Increased Significantly Last Year

    The sales volume of state-owned light industrial products increased significantly in 1953. The output of various major products increased by approximately 31% compared to 1952, and sales increased by more than approximately 29%. The increase in sales was primarily due to the increasing development of national construction undertakings, which led to an increase in the demand for various light industrial products. For example, due to the development of the transportation industry and the increase in the number of heavy vehicles serving basic construction projects, the national demand for automobile tires increased by approximately 65% compared to 1952. Another example is cement bag paper, the national demand for which increased by 15.4% in 1953 compared to 1952. Secondly, the improvement of people's living standards has led to an increase in the demand for consumer goods. For example, the total national consumption of sugar increased by 124.8% in 1953 compared to 1952; cigarette consumption increased by approximately 33.19%. According to statistics from the Northeast Commercial Bureau: The sales volume of state-owned sugar in the region increased by 47.9% in the first half of last year compared to the same period in 1952. Thirdly, the quality of many products has improved, making them popular among the people. For example, the quality of "Red Flag" brand tires in 1952 was poor and not wear-resistant, with an average mileage of approximately 10,000 kilometers, and less than 5,000 kilometers for some. After improving the quality, the average mileage on secondary and tertiary roads in Northeast China was 18,000 kilometers, with some reaching 26,000 kilometers. Another example is the "Progress" brand rubber shoes produced by the State-Owned No. 8 Rubber Factory. In 1952, the products were wide and bulky, the shoe upper fabric faded, and the soles were not wear-resistant, which hindered sales. After improving the style and quality last year, sales reopened. The factory received a total of 633 letters of opinions from workers, peasants, soldiers, department stores, cooperatives, and other sales departments in the past year, of which 227 praised the high quality and good style of the new products (the majority of the rest were suggestions for increasing or decreasing varieties).
    In addition, the Ministry of Light Industry, in cooperation with the Ministry of Commerce, reduced the prices of some products, which was also an important factor in promoting increased sales. For example, on January 5th last year, the national listed price of sugar was reduced by an average of 8.8%. On April 1st, state-owned paper mills in Northeast and North China reduced the factory price of industrial and commercial paper by 11.5%, and commercial departments reduced the listed price by 10%; on August 1st, factories further reduced the factory price of industrial and commercial paper by 5.75%, and commercial departments reduced the listed price by 10%. On April 20th, the listed price of cigarettes in various parts of Guannei (China Proper) was reduced by an average of about 5.6%. Because of the continuous reduction in prices, the price difference between industrial and agricultural products was narrowed. In 1952, one ream of newsprint in Tianjin could be exchanged for 238.98 jin of millet, while in 1953 it could only be exchanged for 217.28 jin of millet. In January 1952, one jin of sugar in Guangzhou was worth 6,400 yuan, equivalent to 4.93 jin of rice; in January 1953, it was 4,200 yuan per jin, equivalent to 3.48 jin of rice. Another example is an account calculated by Tuanbei Township in Nanhui County, Jiangsu Province: In the past, buying one jin of salt required the money for three jin of rice, but now it only requires the money for one jin of rice. The entire township of 3,200 people consumes 15 jin of salt per person per year, totaling 48,000 jin. In the past, buying these jin of salt required 144,000 jin of rice, but now it only requires 48,000 jin. The saved rice can feed the entire township for a month.
    In 1953, there were still some problems in the state-owned light industry sector. There are still varying degrees of imbalance between supply and demand for many products; the quality of some products has not been improved and is not favored by the masses; the specifications of some products are not suitable for market needs; and the cost of some products is high and the price is expensive. These are all issues that need to be improved in the production and sales work in 1954.

### 国家建设事业发展，人民生活水平提高  去年国营轻工业产品销售量显著增长

　　国家建设事业发展，人民生活水平提高
　　去年国营轻工业产品销售量显著增长
    一九五三年国营轻工业产品销售量有很大增长。各种主要产品的产量较一九五二年约增加百分之三十一强，销量约增加百分之二十九以上。销量增加的原因，首先是由于国家建设事业的日益发展，各种轻工业产品的需要量随之增加。例如：由于交通运输业的发展和为基本建设工程服务的大车数量的增多，全国汽车轮胎的需要量较一九五二年约增加百分之六十五。又如水泥袋纸，一九五三年全国需用量较一九五二年增加百分之十五点四。其次是人民生活水平提高，对生活资料的需求有了增长。如食糖，一九五三年全国总消费量较一九五二年增加了百分之一百二十四点八；卷烟约增加了百分之三十三点一九。据东北商业管理局统计：该区去年上半年国营商业砂糖销售额，比一九五二年同期增加了百分之四十七点九。第三，许多产品质量有了提高，广大人民乐于购用。如：红旗牌轮胎一九五二年质量不好，不耐磨，平均行驶里程约一万公里，低者不到五千公里。提高了质量以后，在东北二、三级路面上平均行驶里程为一万八千公里，高者达二万六千公里。又如国营第八橡胶厂所产进步牌胶鞋，一九五二年产品样子又宽又肥，鞋面布褪色，鞋底不耐磨，因而销路阻滞；去年改进了式样，提高了质量以后，销路重又打开。该厂一年来共收到各地工人、农民、战士和百货公司、合作社等销售部门的意见书六百三十三件，其中有二百二十七件是表扬新产品质量高、式样好的（其他大部分是建议增加或减少品种的）。
    此外，轻工业部协同商业部降低了一些产品的价格，也是促进销量增加的重要因素之一。如去年一月五日，全国食糖牌价平均降低百分之八点八。四月一日，东北、华北国营纸厂曾将工商用纸按厂价降低百分之十一点五，商业部门按牌价降低百分之十；八月一日工厂又将工商用纸按厂价降低百分之五点七五，商业部门按牌价降低百分之十。四月二十日，关内各地卷烟牌价平均降低百分之五点六左右。因为不断降低价格，便缩小了工农业产品之间的差价，一九五二年每令新闻纸在天津换小米二三八点九八斤，一九五三年只换小米二一七点二八斤。一九五二年一月每斤食糖在广州值六千四百元，合米四点九三斤；一九五三年一月每斤四千二百元，合米三点四八斤。又如江苏省南汇县团北乡算了一笔食盐的账：过去买一斤盐要用三斤米的钱，现在只用一斤米的钱，全乡三千二百人，每人每年吃盐以十五斤算，共需四万八千斤。过去买这些斤盐，要米十四万四千斤，现在只要四万八千斤。节省下来的米，可供全乡人吃一个月。
    一九五三年在国营轻工业部门中，也还存在一些问题。不少产品还存在着程度不同的供需不平衡现象；有些产品质量未能提高，不为群众所喜购乐用；有些产品规格不适合市场需要；有些产品成本高、价格贵。这些都是要在一九五四年的产销工作中加以改善的。
