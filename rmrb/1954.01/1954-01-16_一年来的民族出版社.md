    The Nationalities Publishing House in the Past Year
    Han Daoren
    To help the people of all ethnic minorities develop their cultural and educational undertakings, under the leadership of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government and the Publication Administration, the Nationalities Publishing House was established on January 15, 1953, and it has been a whole year now. It is a specialized publishing house for publishing books in the languages of domestic ethnic minorities and related to ethnic issues.
    In the past year, the Nationalities Publishing House has made great progress in the translation and publication of minority languages. Throughout the year, it translated and published 139 kinds of books and pictorials in Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Korean languages, with a total printing of 1,099,560 copies. In addition, there were 23 kinds of New Year pictures published in minority languages, with a total of 142,000 copies. Among the books and periodicals, 61 kinds were published in Mongolian, with a total of 400,300 copies; 19 kinds were published in Tibetan, with a total of 253,760 copies; 33 kinds were published in Uyghur, with a total of 359,000 copies; 21 kinds were published in Kazakh, with a total of 74,500 copies; and 5 kinds were published in Korean, with a total of 12,000 copies (the Korean Translation and Compilation Office was only established in August last year). These publications include classic works of Marxist-Leninist theory, the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works, which are highly valued by all ethnic groups, important state policies, laws and regulations, and documents on ethnic policies, reading materials to help cadres study, literary works loved by the people of ethnic minorities, the People's Pictorial published in Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Korean languages and its ethnic-language supplements, which are most welcomed by all ethnic minorities, and carefully selected excellent comic books. The publication of these books and periodicals has been warmly welcomed and loved by the people of all ethnic minorities. Through these publications, the theory of Marxism-Leninism has been disseminated among the people of ethnic minorities, education on ethnic policies has been carried out, and the construction cause of the great motherland has been introduced. This has enlightened the political consciousness of the people of ethnic minorities, enhanced their patriotism and internationalism, strengthened national unity, and helped ethnic minority cadres in their studies. The publication of policy and law books has also closely cooperated with political movements, such as the publication of the "Election Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China" in various ethnic minority languages, which timely cooperated with the universal suffrage movement in ethnic minority areas.
    Before liberation, the feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang reactionary rule devastated the culture of ethnic minorities and restricted the people of ethnic minorities from using their own languages, making it impossible for ethnic minority languages to develop. As a result, some ethnic groups had their own writing systems, but very few publications. Take Tibetan as an example. The Tibetan people had their own writing system from the 7th century, but until before liberation, there were very few Tibetan publications. In Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, until the peaceful liberation, it was still stuck in woodblock printing, and there were no letterpress publications. Therefore, when the Tibetan people saw beautifully printed Tibetan pictorials and books, they were extremely excited and loved them. They said with emotion, "Thank Chairman Mao for turning our Tibetan language around." Many Tibetan people, when they saw the pictorials with Chairman Mao's photo, would put it on their heads, with the same respect and love as for Buddhist scriptures. Some Tibetan people in the Golog area of Qinghai Province traveled one or two hundred li to ask the work team for pictorials. When the work team ran out of pictorials, some Tibetan people offered two silver dollars to buy pictorials from others. Many Tibetan people said, "Chairman Mao not only made our lives better, but also told us many things we didn't know in the pictorials." They gained a lot of new knowledge and new production experience from the pictorials, and loved our great motherland even more." Duojizhandong, a Red Sect representative from Saga, Tibet, to Beijing, said, "I originally had some doubts about the people's government's ethnic and religious policies, but after reading the Tibetan version of the ethnic policy documents, all the problems were solved." These facts show that Tibetan publications have had a wider impact and role among the vast Tibetan people.
    Publications in other ethnic minority languages, like Tibetan, have also been warmly welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups. For example, the Mongolian people in the Mongolian village of the Fourth District of Zhenlai County, Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, would run to see the pictorials whenever the Mongolian version of the People's Pictorial was distributed to the area. Many young people in this village who did not know Mongolian before have actively started learning Mongolian due to the influence of reading pictorials and Mongolian books. Uyghur and Kazakh publications have also been welcomed and loved by the Uyghur and Kazakh people in Xinjiang. All Uyghur and Kazakh books and periodicals published in Beijing are in short supply. The Uyghur version of "New Heroes and Heroines" is the first full-length novel introduced to the Uyghur people. A total of 20,000 copies of this book were printed, and it has already been sold out. Xinhua Bookstore has requested a reprint. Printing 20,000 copies may not seem like a large number, but calculated according to the entire Uyghur population of about four million, it is equivalent to one book for every 200 people. This book has been particularly praised by Uyghur farmers, who said, "This is a book truly written in our own language." They felt exceptionally close to the characters in the book, understood the arduous struggle of the Han people in the Anti-Japanese War, and thus further enhanced national friendship and stimulated patriotic enthusiasm and the enthusiasm to build the motherland. Some farmers who could not read themselves asked literate people to read to them, and some people who could not buy the book borrowed it, with several readers circulating one book together.
    From the above situation, it can be seen that in the past year, the Nationalities Publishing House has made great achievements in the translation and publication of minority languages. These achievements have been achieved by implementing the Central People's Government's policy of developing minority languages and overcoming some difficulties in the translation and publication work, such as the lack of translation cadres, technicians, and certain material conditions. However, there are still shortcomings and errors in the work. First of all, the quality of some publications is not high enough. For example, errors in translation and errors caused by careless proofreading, review, and transcription are often found in some publications. The content of individual books is not entirely suitable for the current urgent needs of ethnic minority areas. Some books have not selected the best and latest versions.
    Secondly, some readers have reflected that the translation of some Tibetan books is not popular enough. Many classical texts are difficult for general readers to understand, and the translated terms are not unified. The solution to this problem, due to the limitations of the Tibetan language itself, still has various difficulties, so it must be solved through long-term efforts, combined with the development of the Tibetan language itself.
    In addition, the planning of publishing work is not sufficient. Due to insufficient contact with local publishing houses, there are duplicate translation phenomena in individual books; at the same time, due to insufficient understanding of the situation, some books cannot fully meet the needs of readers, such as the "Uyghur-Chinese-Russian Dictionary" compiled by Burhan, which is a tool book to help language learning and needs to be supplied in large quantities. Although 20,000 copies of this dictionary were also distributed, it is still far from the actual needs. According to the Xinhua Bookstore in Xinjiang, only one book can be distributed for every 50 registered readers who pre-ordered the book in the bookstore, which has caused dissatisfaction among readers.
    These shortcomings need to be corrected in future work.

    一年来的民族出版社
    韩道仁
    为了帮助各少数民族人民发展文化教育事业，在中央人民政府民族事务委员会与出版总署的领导下，民族出版社于一九五三年一月十五日成立，到现在整一年了。它是出版国内少数民族文字及有关民族问题的读物的一个专门出版社。
    一年来，民族出版社在少数民族文字的翻译出版工作上有了很大的发展。全年用蒙、藏、维、哈、朝鲜五种少数民族文字翻译出版了一百三十九种书籍和画刊，共印行一百零九万九千五百六十册。另外并有以少数民族文字出版的年画二十三种，共十四万二千张。在书刊中，用蒙文出版了六十一种，共四十万零三百册；用藏文出版了十九种，共二十五万三千七百六十册；用维文出版了三十三种，共三十五万九千册；用哈文出版了二十一种，共七万四千五百册；用朝鲜文出版了五种，共一万二千册（朝鲜文编译室是在去年八月间才建立的）。这些出版物中，有马克思列宁主义理论的经典著作，有各民族异常珍视的“毛泽东选集”和毛主席著作的单行本，有国家的重要政策法令和民族政策的文献，有帮助干部学习的读物，也有为少数民族人民所爱好的文艺著作，有最受各少数民族欢迎的以蒙、藏、维、朝鲜文出版的人民画报及其民族版副册，也有经过精选的优秀的连环画。这些书刊的出版，受到各少数民族人民热烈欢迎和热爱。通过这些出版物，在少数民族人民中传播了马克思列宁主义的理论，进行了民族政策的教育，介绍了伟大祖国的建设事业。这样就启发了少数民族人民的政治觉悟，提高了少数民族人民的爱国主义和国际主义思想，并加强了民族团结和帮助了少数民族干部的学习。政策法令书籍的出版也密切地配合了政治运动，如各种少数民族文字的“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”的出版，及时地配合了各民族地区的普选运动。
    解放前，由于过去的封建王朝和国民党反动统治摧残少数民族的文化，限制少数民族人民使用自己语文，使少数民族语文不能够发展。以致有的民族虽然有自己的民族文字，但出版物很少。就拿藏文来说，从七世纪开始，藏族就有了自己的文字，但是直到解放前为止，藏文出版物还很少。在西藏首邑拉萨直到和平解放时为止，还停滞在木版印刷，还没有铅印的出版物。因此当藏族人民看到印刷精美的藏文画报和书籍时，都异常兴奋和热爱，他们感动地说：“感谢毛主席叫我们的藏文也翻了身。”很多藏族人民看到载有毛主席像片的画报，都把它顶在头上，像对佛经一样的尊重和热爱。青海果洛区的藏族人民有的跑一两百里路去找工作团要画报，工作团的画报发完了，有的藏民出两块银元要买别人的画报。很多藏民说：“毛主席不光是叫我们的日子好过了，还在画报上告诉我们许多不知道的事情。”他们在画报上获得了很多新的知识和新的生产经验，对我们伟大的祖国更加热爱了。”一位从西藏萨迦到北京来的红教代表多吉占东说：“我原来对人民政府的民族政策和宗教政策还有一些疑问，但是看了藏文的民族政策文件以后，所有的问题都解决了。”这些事实，说明了藏文的出版物在广大藏族人民中间已经起了较广泛的影响和作用。
    其他民族文字的出版物，也同藏文一样受到各族人民的热烈欢迎。如东北黑龙江省镇赉县四区蒙古村的蒙族人民，每当蒙文版人民画报发到该地的时候，都跑来看画报。这村有很多青年原来不识蒙文，由于看画报和蒙文书籍的影响而积极学起蒙文来。维、哈文的出版物也受到新疆维、哈族人民的欢迎和热爱，所有北京出版的维、哈文书刊都供不应求。维文的“新儿女英雄传”是第一部介绍给维族人民的长篇小说。这本书共印了两万册，而早已销售一空，新华书店已要求再版。发行两万册，看来数字并不算大，但是按维族的全部人口四百万人左右平均计算，就等于每二百人有一本书。这本书特别得到维族农民的好评，他们说：“这是真正用我们自己语言写成的书。”他们对书中的人物感到异常亲切，他们了解了汉族人民在抗日战争中的艰苦斗争，因而更增进了民族友谊，激发了爱国热情和建设祖国的积极性。有些农民自己不识字，就请识字的人读给他们听，有的人买不到书就借阅，一本书有几个读者共同传阅。
    从以上的情况看，一年来，民族出版社在少数民族文字的翻译出版工作上是有很大成绩的，这些成绩是贯彻了中央人民政府发展少数民族语言文字的政策和克服了翻译出版工作中的若干困难，如翻译干部、技术工人和某些物质条件的缺乏而获得的。但是工作上还是有缺点和错误的。首先是有些出版物的质量还不够高，如有些出版物中还经常发现翻译文字上的错误和由于校对、审查和抄写不慎所造成的错误。也有个别书籍的内容还不完全适合于目前少数民族地区的迫切需要。有的书籍没有选择最好的和最新的版本。
    其次是有些读者反映，有些藏文书籍翻译文字不够通俗，很多经典式的文字，一般读者感到难懂，译词也不统一。这个问题的解决，由于藏文本身条件的限制，还有种种困难，所以必须经过长期努力，结合藏族语文本身的发展才能解决。
    此外，出版工作的计划性不够。由于和地方出版社联系不够，个别书籍有翻译上的重复现象；同时由于了解情况不够，有的书籍不能充分满足读者的需要，如鲍尔汉编著的“维汉俄辞典”，是帮助学习语文的工具书，需要大量供应。这本辞典虽然也发行两万册，但距实际需要仍太远。据新疆的新华书店反映：在书店登记预购的五十多个读者才能分到一本书，因而引起读者的不满。
    以上这些缺点还需要在今后工作中注意纠正。
