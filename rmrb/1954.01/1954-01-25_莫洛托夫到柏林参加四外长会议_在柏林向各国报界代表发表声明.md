　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 23rd: TASS Berlin, January 23rd dispatch: Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs V.M. Molotov and his entourage arrived in Berlin on the 23rd to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference.

　　Greeting V.M. Molotov at Berlin's Schönefeld Airport were officials of the German Democratic Republic government headed by Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl, Chairman of the People's Chamber Johannes Dieckmann, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic Lothar Bolz, representatives of various democratic parties and public organizations, as well as many representatives of the people of Berlin.

　　Also present at the airport to welcome the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs were the heads of many embassies and legations residing in the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet High Commissioner for Germany, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary V.S. Semyonov, and officials from the embassy and the High Commissioner's office.

　　Upon arrival, Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs V.M. Molotov handed a written statement to representatives of the Soviet and foreign press. The statement reads as follows:

　　"The extent to which the Berlin Conference fulfills its tasks depends on how much it can contribute to strengthening peace, easing international tensions, and truly ensuring European security.

　　Five years have passed since the last Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference.

　　The fact that an agreement was reached on convening the Berlin Conference and the reaction it has aroused in international public opinion both show that the necessity of the upcoming conference is universally recognized, and millions of people will be watching the progress of this conference. The sooner the People's Republic of China, the country of a great people, participates in conferences on pressing international issues, the more helpful it will be to consolidate international peace.

　　The Soviet Union has never had, and does not now have, any intentions against other countries, against the freedom and national rights of other peoples. The Soviet Union supports the desire of any country to seek the happiness and security of its people, because this desire does not violate the interests and rights of other countries. The Soviet government hopes that other countries will treat the Soviet Union with the same attitude.

　　Finally, let me express my gratitude to the government of the German Democratic Republic and all our German friends for the warm reception of our Soviet representatives in Berlin."

　　Along the way, Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs V.M. Molotov and his entourage were warmly welcomed by tens of thousands of working people of Berlin.

    莫洛托夫到柏林参加四外长会议
    在柏林向各国报界代表发表声明
   【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社柏林二十三日电：苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫和他的随行人员于二十三日到达柏林来参加四国外长会议。
    到柏林什涅菲尔德机场欢迎维·米·莫洛托夫的有以总理奥托·格罗提渥为首的德意志民主共和国政府官员、人民议院主席约翰尼斯·狄克曼、德意志民主共和国副总理兼外交部部长洛塔·博尔茨、各民主政党和公众团体的代表以及柏林人民的许多代表。
    到机场欢迎苏联外交部部长的还有驻德意志民主共和国的许多大使馆和公使馆的首长，苏联驻德高级专员、特命全权大使弗·斯·谢麦诺夫以及大使馆和高级专员公署的官员。
    苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫到达后，把书面声明递交给苏联和外国的报界代表。声明如下：
    “柏林会议完成它的任务的程度，取决于它对加强和平、缓和国际紧张局势以及真正保障欧洲安全能够作出多大的贡献。
    自从上次四国外长会议到现在，已经过去五年了。
    在召开柏林会议问题上达成了协议这一事实以及它在国际舆论界中所引起的反响都说明，即将举行的会议的必要性是大家普遍承认的，千千万万的人们将注视着这次会议的进展。伟大人民的国家中华人民共和国参加关于迫切的国际问题的会议愈早，对巩固国际和平就愈有帮助。
    苏联从来没有、现在也没有怀着任何反对其他国家、反对他国人民的自由与民族权利的意图。苏联支持任何国家谋取人民的幸福与安全的愿望，因为这种愿望是不违反其他国家的利益与权利的。苏联政府希望其他国家也以同样的态度对待苏联。
    最后，让我向德意志民主共和国政府和所有的德国朋友们在柏林对我们苏联代表的殷勤接待表示感谢。”
    沿路，苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫和他的随行人员受到了成千上万的柏林劳动人民的热烈欢迎。
