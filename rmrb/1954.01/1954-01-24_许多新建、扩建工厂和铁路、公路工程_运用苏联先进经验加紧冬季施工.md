    Many Newly Built and Expanded Factories and Railway and Highway Projects Intensify Winter Construction by Applying Advanced Soviet Experience

    [Reported by this newspaper] Important projects such as China's new First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory, the Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant, certain reconstruction and expansion projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, the Shenyang Smelter, the Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the Soviet Exhibition Center, and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway's Wushaoling section, the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, the Hanshui Bridge, and the Yongding River No. 8 Bridge are all undergoing intensive winter construction.

    To ensure the smooth progress of winter construction, various project units have adopted many appropriate construction measures. After the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant entered winter, it adopted a series of appropriate construction methods, including warm sheds, blower heating, electric preheating, and steam or stove warming. At the Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory site, with the help of Soviet experts, a semi-mechanized concrete mortar heating station was established, and heating pipes for steam curing of concrete, as well as other winter construction insulation equipment, were laid. At the Soviet Exhibition Center construction site in Beijing, under the guidance of Soviet experts, a method combining heat storage and warm sheds was adopted based on the complexity of the engineering structure. To prevent heat loss during the mixing and transportation of concrete, warm sheds were also built for the mixers, and the winches were surrounded with mats and straw curtains. The concrete transport carts were covered with burlap sacks and straw curtains to maintain a temperature of about 10 degrees Celsius. Tens of thousands of railway workers working on Wushaoling are wearing cotton coats and *wula* shoes transported from the Northeast, and wearing leather hats and large gloves to carry out their work. Various project units have also organized employees to learn from the advanced Soviet experience in winter construction. The Anshan Iron and Steel Rolling Mill Engineering Company concentrated more than 380 cement workers and bricklayer foremen and team leaders with technical grade three and above to study Soviet winter construction methods. When pouring monolithic reinforced concrete grids, beams, and floor slabs, the concrete workers at the Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory site conscientiously studied the Soviet heat storage method, ensuring that the quality and strength of various concrete projects reached 120 percent of the specified standards.

    In order to strive for the early realization of the country's socialist industrialization, the employees of various project units are actively overcoming the difficulties in winter construction. When the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's mechanical assembly shop was hoisting pillars, the crane parts were frozen and difficult to start. Driver Zhang Shuxuan got up at 4 a.m. to warm the parts with charcoal fire to ensure on-time operation. The crane had difficulty moving on the snowy ground, so crane operator Yang Bifu laid grass bags on the snow so that the crane could move forward smoothly by pressing on the grass bags. Road construction workers on Wushaoling overcame difficulties and worked day and night in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. Liu Dejun, the squad leader of the 23rd Detachment, and foreman Lu Lei, together with the workers, developed a method of using picks to pry frozen soil blocks, which increased work efficiency by four times and solved the past difficulties of so-called "picks unable to dig" and "steel chisels unable to pry." Some workers implemented continuous excavation "wheel warfare" in order to prevent the soil from freezing. All the employees involved in the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway enthusiastically launched a red flag competition in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area, which is more than 4,900 meters above sea level, completing some of the renovation projects in the construction plan eleven days ahead of schedule. The employees who are building the Hanshui Bridge are now actively preparing for the pile driving of Pier No. 5 and will soon begin underwater construction.

    许多新建、扩建工厂和铁路、公路工程
    运用苏联先进经验加紧冬季施工
   【本报讯】我国新建第一汽车制造厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、太原电热厂、鞍钢某些改建扩建工程、沈阳冶炼厂、郑州第一棉纺织厂、北京第一棉纺织厂、苏联展览馆等重要工程和兰新铁路乌鞘岭段工程、青藏公路、汉水大桥、永定河八号大桥等工程，正在紧张进行冬季施工。
    各工程单位为了使冬季施工能够顺利进行，采取了许多妥善的施工措施。第一汽车制造厂各项工程进入冬季后，分别采取了暖棚、鼓风机送热、通电预热、蒸气或火炉保暖等一套妥善的施工办法。量具刃具厂工地，在苏联专家帮助下，建立了半机械化的混凝土胶泥加热站，敷设了供给混凝土蒸气养生用的暖气管道，以及其他冬季施工的保温设备。在北京兴建的苏联展览馆工地，在苏联专家指导下，根据工程结构的复杂情况，采取了蓄热与搭暖棚并用的办法。为了防止混凝土在搅拌和运送中散失热量，也为搅拌机搭了暖棚，又用席子和草帘把卷扬机围起来，把运送混凝土的小车用麻袋和草帘盖好，使混凝土能保持摄氏十度左右的温度。在乌鞘岭上工作的数万名铁路职工，穿着棉大衣和从东北运来的靰鞡鞋，戴着皮帽子、大手套进行工作。各工程单位还组织职工学习了苏联冬季施工的先进经验。鞍钢轧钢工程公司集中了三百八十多名三级技术以上的水泥工和瓦工工长、小组长，学习苏联冬季施工方法。量具刃具厂工地的混凝土工人在打整体钢筋混凝土格、梁、楼板时，认真学习了苏联的蓄热法，使各项混凝土工程质量强度达到规定标准百分之一百二十。
    为了争取国家社会主义工业化早日实现，各工程单位的职工积极克服冬季施工中的困难。第一汽车制造厂机械装配一场装吊柱子时，吊车机件被冻住难以发动，司机张树萱为保证按时作业，清晨四时起床，用炭火将机件烤暖。吊车在雪地行动不便，起重工人杨必富把草袋子铺在雪地上，让吊车压着草袋顺利前进。乌鞘岭上的筑路工人，在零下三十度的严寒里，克服困难，不分昼夜地工作。第二十三联队的小队长刘德君、领工员吕磊，和工人一起研究出用顶镐顶冻土块的方法，工作效率提高了四倍，解决了过去所谓“洋镐挖不动”、“钢钎撬不起”的困难。有些工人，为了不让土壤结冻，实行了连续开挖的“车轮战术”。修筑青藏公路的全体职工，在拔海四千九百公尺以上的青藏高原地带热烈地展开了红旗竞赛，使施工计划中的部分整修工程，提前十一天完成。修筑汉水大桥的职工们，现正积极准备五号桥墩的打桩工作，即将开始在水下施工。
