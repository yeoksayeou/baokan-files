Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 25th Dispatch from TASS, Berlin, 24th: Newspapers in the German Democratic Republic and West Berlin have prominently published the news of the arrival of Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov in Berlin and his statement to press representatives. Newspapers in the German Democratic Republic published the full text of Molotov's statement, while West Berlin newspapers only published a small excerpt, omitting many of the most important points.

The West Berlin newspapers, published with the permission of the United States, Britain, and France, evaded the following two parts of Molotov's statement: One part was, "The Soviet Union has never had, and does not now have, any intention of opposing other countries or the freedom and national rights of other peoples. The Soviet Union supports the desire of any country to seek the happiness and security of its people, because such a desire does not violate the interests and rights of other countries. The Soviet government hopes that other countries will treat the Soviet Union in the same way." The other part was, "The extent to which the Berlin Conference completes its task depends on how much it can contribute to strengthening peace, easing international tensions, and truly guaranteeing European security."

All West Berlin newspapers highlighted the following sentence from Molotov in their headlines: "The sooner the People's Republic of China, a country with a great people, participates in conferences on urgent international issues, the more helpful it will be to consolidating international peace."

Judging from the reaction of West Berlin newspapers to Molotov's statement, they are attempting to create the impression that Molotov's statement did not mention the German question. However, it is well known that when Molotov spoke about how the Berlin Conference could complete its task, he specifically pointed out at the beginning that European security must be truly guaranteed. To achieve this task, the German question must be resolved on a peaceful and democratic basis. The "Neues Deutschland" wrote in its editorial on the 24th regarding the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, in referring to the German people's hopes, "These hopes and desires are understandable, because a peaceful resolution of the German question will become an important factor in easing international tensions and guaranteeing the security of all peoples and world peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 25th: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France was held in Berlin this afternoon. The question that the people of Europe and the world are asking the conference is: "Can international tensions be further eased? Can the revival of West German militarist forces be stopped, thereby truly guaranteeing European peace and the security of all countries?"

The people of East and West Germany, who are eager to restore Germany's unification and independence on a peaceful and democratic basis, are particularly concerned about this Four Foreign Ministers Conference being held in the capital of their country. Since the New Year, the people in the democratic sector of Berlin have been proposing to welcome the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in a peaceful atmosphere. As of January 23rd, more than 8.5 million people in the German Democratic Republic had signed in support of the demands put forward by the People's Chamber and the government of the German Democratic Republic: a peaceful resolution of the German question and allowing German representatives to participate in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Many people in West Germany have also raised the same demands. Working people throughout Germany have held rallies demanding that German representatives participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference. In democratic Germany, a mass rally of 80,000 people was held in Halle, and a rally of 20,000 people was held in Dessau, demanding that representatives from East and West Germany participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference. Rallies were also held in Cologne, Heidelberg, Stuttgart, Bremen, and other cities in West Germany, demanding that representatives from East and West Germany participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference and peacefully resolve the German question. Deputy Mayor of Greater Berlin, Fechner, participated in the rally held in Cologne, and Dr. Wedemann, the mayor of Weimar in the German Democratic Republic, also participated in the rally in Heidelberg as a guest, and they were warmly welcomed by the local residents.

At the same time, Adenauer is busy starting discussions on the implementation of universal conscription in the Bonn Federal Parliament, and he is sending Nazi theorists who once served Hitler to Berlin as special envoys to observe the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

The above facts show that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference has brought hope to the German people, but there are still serious obstacles hindering the prospect of peacefully and reasonably resolving the German question.

    全德报纸重视莫洛托夫外长声明
   【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十四日讯：德意志民主共和国和西柏林的报纸都以显著地位登载了苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫抵达柏林的消息和他向报界代表发表的声明。德意志民主共和国的报纸全文登载了莫洛托夫的声明，而西柏林报纸只简单地摘发了一小部分，删掉了其中许多最重要的地方。
    在美国、英国、法国允许下出版的西柏林报纸，对莫洛托夫声明中下面这两部分采取了回避态度：一部分是“苏联从来没有、现在也没有怀着任何反对其他国家、反对他国人民的自由与民族权利的意图。苏联支持任何国家谋取人民的幸福与安全的愿望，因为这种愿望是不违反其他国家的利益与权利的。苏联政府希望其他国家也以同样的态度对待苏联。”另一部分是“柏林会议完成它的任务的程度，取决于它对加强和平、缓和国际紧张局势以及真正保障欧洲安全能够作出多大的贡献。”
    西柏林的所有报纸都在标题中着重地标出莫洛托夫的下面一句话：“伟大人民的国家中华人民共和国参加关于迫切的国际问题的会议愈早，对巩固国际和平就愈有帮助。”
    从西柏林的报纸对莫洛托夫的反应看来，西柏林的报纸是企图使人认为：似乎莫洛托夫的声明没有谈到德国问题。可是大家知道，莫洛托夫在声明中谈到柏林会议如何才能完成它的任务时，一开始就特别指出必须真正保障欧洲的安全。而要实现这一任务，就必须在和平、民主的基础上解决德国问题。“新德意志报”在二十四日的关于四国外长会议的社论中谈到德国人民的这种愿望时写道：“这种希望和愿望是可以理解的，因为德国问题的和平解决，将成为缓和国际紧张局势、保障各国人民的安全与世界和平的重要因素。”
   【新华社柏林二十五日电】苏、美、英、法四国外长会议今天下午在柏林举行。欧洲和全世界人民向会议提出来的问题是：“国际紧张局势能够进一步缓和吗？西德军国主义势力的复活能够被制止，从而真正保障欧洲和平与各国的安全吗？”
    渴望在和平与民主的基础上恢复德国的统一与独立的东德和西德人民特别关心这一次在他们国家首都召开的四国外长会议。自从新年以来，柏林民主区人民一直在提出要在和平的气氛中迎接四国外长会议。截至一月二十三日为止，在德意志民主共和国，已经有八百五十万以上的人签名支持德意志民主共和国人民议院和政府所提出的要求：和平解决德国问题和允许德国代表参加四国外长会议。西德的许多人民也提出了同样的要求。全德各地劳动人民纷纷举行集会要求有德国人的代表参加外长会议。在民主德国，在哈雷举行了八万人的群众大会，在德骚举行了两万人的大会，要求东德和西德的代表参加外长会议。在西德的科隆、海得尔堡、斯图加特、不来梅和其他城市也举行了集会，要求东德和西德的代表参加外长会议与和平解决德国问题。大柏林市副市长费希纳参加了在科隆举行的集会，德意志民主共和国魏玛市市长韦迪曼博士也以来宾身份参加了海得尔堡的集会，他们都受到了当地居民的热烈欢迎。
    与此同时，阿登纳却正在忙着在波恩联邦议院中开始讨论实行普遍征兵法，并派遣曾为希特勒效劳的纳粹理论家到柏林去作为观察四国外长会议的特使。
    以上这些事实说明，四国外长会议为德国人民带来了希望，但是在和平地与合理地解决德国问题的前途上还横着严重的障碍。
