Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th. Our correspondent reports: Today, the Indian Custodial Forces began illegally handing over Korean and Chinese POWs in the Tongjang-ri area to the U.S. military authorities. It is understood that the entire transfer will be completed by midnight today. However, according to Indian sources, approximately eighty POWs risked their lives and broke away during the transfer, demanding repatriation. Special agents made every effort to obstruct these POWs when they demanded repatriation. This is a vivid exposure of the U.S. plot to forcibly detain POWs.

Today's illegal handover took place under the severe encirclement and control of U.S. armed forces and special agent organizations. Early in the morning, special agents stuck the "national flags" of the United States and the Li and Chiang bandit gangs on the barbed wire around each camp area. On the hills northwest of the POW camp, near Camp No. 17, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents from Taiwan used loudspeakers to frantically shout to each camp, saying that the U.S. military was outside, in order to coerce the POWs and order them to line up in five columns to leave the camp. Under the shadow of this intimidating sound, special agents and "security team members" in camps 17, 15, 14, and 13, etc., carried wooden sticks, and some even held short knives, forcing the POWs to immediately dismantle their tents and burn all the tables, chairs, rubber shoes, documents, and various notebooks that could not be taken away with kerosene. The sky over Dongjang-ri was filled with thick smoke.

U.S. fighter jets, reconnaissance planes, and helicopters were flying back and forth and roaring over the area near the demilitarized zone from early morning. The Chiang bandit special agents in the camp frantically shouted to the POWs: "The Allied planes are here! Escort us to Taiwan!" At 9:23 AM, U.S. and Li military personnel patrolling between the camp and the Military Demarcation Line called out to the special agents in Camp No. 14 using walkie-talkies and patted the guns on their bodies to coerce the POWs.

Today's illegal handover situation shows that the POWs are demanding repatriation, and they are being abducted under the strict control of U.S. special agents and the direct military threat of the United States. This organized criminal act of forcibly detaining a large number of POWs is a continuation of their perfidious act of allowing Syngman Rhee to abduct more than 27,000 POWs in June 1953. The U.S. will pay an inestimable price for this criminal behavior.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Henri Cartier-Bresson, a reporter for the Paris newspaper "l'Humanité," reported from Panmunjom on the 20th: Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang special agents, under the protection of hundreds of Li bandit gang members and U.S. military police, are effectively controlling today's forced handover of 22,000 Korean and Chinese POWs. The most ruthless camp special agent bosses stood arrogantly beside Indian officers and U.S. and Li military police. Hundreds of U.S. and Li military police swarmed into the custodial area. The original plan of the Indian Custodial Forces was to have the POWs walk past the table one by one in a line, but this plan was not implemented due to the opposition of the special agents. The special agents forced the POWs to run in groups through a corridor made of barbed wire. There was a place in this corridor where they could rush out to regain their freedom, but this exit was guarded by special agents protected by the police. A few POWs risked rushing out, ignoring the special agents' guard, and tried to escape, but they were immediately caught back by the special agent bosses, and other special agents beat these captured POWs with wooden sticks in front of the Indian officers and Swedish and Swiss observers until they died. In the first hour of the transfer, the highest-ranking Indian officer supervising the scene was a major. This major was in fact taking orders from the special agent bosses inside the camp.

The special agents grabbed the POWs by both arms and dragged them through the so-called "checking point," apparently handing them directly over to the executioners of Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang. At this time, the Indian officers recounted some tragic scenes. How many people were killed in the camp in the past few days may never be known. Today, in many camps, special agents poured gasoline on some tents and then set them on fire. The Indian officer believed that this was a funeral fire for the murdered people. These murdered people may have been trying to escape today. Initially, the special agents demanded that every escaped POW be returned to them. When this request was refused, the Americans set about preventing the approval of repatriation requests. They did not allow representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to pass through the areas they controlled to participate in the approval work. Finally, the POWs were taken through Panmunjom and handed over after being approved without a U.S. translator present. During the transfer, American planes roared in the sky, apparently demonstrating against the POWs waiting to escape and the Indian Custodial Forces.

### 朝中战俘被印军非法交给美方  美方劫夺战俘的罪恶计划开始实行  约八十名朝中被俘人员冒死要求遣返

    朝中战俘被印军非法交给美方
    美方劫夺战俘的罪恶计划开始实行
    约八十名朝中被俘人员冒死要求遣返
   【新华社开城二十日电】本社特派记者报道：今天印度看管部队开始把东场里的朝中被俘人员非法交还美军当局。据悉，全部移交工作将在今日午夜完成。但据印度人士称，已有约八十名战俘在被移交时冒死冲出来要求遣返。特务分子在这些战俘要求遣返时曾经竭力加以阻挠。这是对于美方强迫扣留战俘阴谋的生动的揭露。
    今天的非法交还是在美方武装力量和特务组织的严重包围和控制之下进行的。清早，特务们在各个营场周围的铁丝网上，插起了美国和李、蒋匪帮的“国旗”。在战俘营西北、靠近十七号营场的山岭上，有台湾派来的蒋匪特务用扩音器疯狂地向各个营场喊叫说美军就在外面，以此来胁迫战俘，并命令战俘排成五路离开营场。在这种恫吓声音的笼罩下，十七号、十五号、十四号和十三号等营场内的特务和“警备队员”，都手提木棒，有的手里还拿着短刀，威逼着战俘立刻拆帐篷，用火油烧毁一切带不走的桌椅、胶鞋、文件和各种本子，东场里的上空弥漫着浓烟。
    美国的战斗机、侦察机和直升飞机，从一清早起就在非军事区附近上空穿梭般地飞掠着、吼叫着。营场里的蒋匪特务拚命地向战俘喊叫：“联军的飞机来了呀，掩护我们到台湾哪！”在九点二十三分时，巡逻于营场与军事分界线之间的美、李军人员，更用步行机向十四号营场里的特务呼叫，并拍着身上的枪，来对战俘进行胁迫。
    今天非法交还的情况表明：战俘们是要求遣返的，他们是在美方特务的严密控制和美国直接的军事威胁之下被劫走的。美方这一有组织地强迫扣留大批战俘的罪恶行动，正是他们在一九五三年六月背信弃义地纵容李承晚劫走二万七千余名战俘的行动的继续。美方必将为他们的这种罪恶行为付出不可估计的代价。
      【新华社二十日讯】巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌二十日自板门店报道：李承晚和国民党的特务在数百名李匪帮和美国的军事警察的保护之下实际上控制了今天强迫交还二万二千名朝中战俘的行动。最凶狠的营场特务头子都傲慢地站立在印度军官和美李军事警察的身旁。有数百名美李军事警察蜂拥进入看管地区。印度看管部队原定的计划是让战俘们排着队一个一个地走过桌子，但这个计划因为特务的反对未能实行。特务们强迫战俘大群地跑过铁丝网夹成的走廊。这走廊里有一处是可以冲出去恢复自由的，但这个出路却由警察保护下的特务把守着。少数战俘不顾特务的把守冒险冲出来，试图逃跑，但是他们马上被特务头子抓了回去，其他的特务就当着印度军官，瑞典和瑞士观察代表的面用木棍打这些抓回去的战俘，一直打到他们死。在移交的第一个小时内，到场监督的最高级印度军官是一位少校。这位少校事实上是听命于营场内的特务头子的。
    特务们挟着战俘的两只手臂，架着他们走过所谓“查点处”，显然就是把他们直接交给李承晚和国民党的刽子手们。在这时候，印度军官讲述了一些悲惨的景象。过去几天里营场内杀死了多少人，也许是永远不会被人知道的。今天，在许多营场内，特务把汽油倒在某些帐篷上，然后放火烧掉。印度军官认为：这是为被杀害的人烧的葬火。这些被杀害的人可能是要在今天试图逃跑的。起先，特务们要求把每一个逃走的战俘都交还给他们。当这个要求被拒绝后，美国人就着手阻止批准遣返要求。他们不让中立国遣返委员会代表走过他们控制的地方去参加批准工作。最后，战俘们被带过板门店，而且没有美国方面的翻译员在场，就被批准而移交过去了。在进行移交的时候，美国的飞机在天空中吼叫，显然这是在对候机逃跑的战俘和印度看管部队示威。
