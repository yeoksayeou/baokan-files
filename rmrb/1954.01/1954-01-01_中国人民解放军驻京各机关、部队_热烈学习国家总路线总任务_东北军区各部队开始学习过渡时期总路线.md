    PLA Units Stationed in Beijing Enthusiastically Study the General Line and General Task of the State
    Northeast Military Region Units Begin to Study the General Line for the Transition Period
    The PLA units stationed in Beijing are enthusiastically studying the general line and general task of the state during the transition period. Leading organs of the PLA units stationed in Beijing and the CCP committees of various units have, according to the instructions of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission, made specific arrangements for this study task. Many unit leaders have personally presided over education preparation meetings or given lectures themselves. Unit newspapers and magazines have also successively published editorials on studying the general line and general task, and published concise propaganda points, speaking materials, etc. Some units have also used wired broadcasting, pictures, and movies to promote learning.

    Commanders and fighters of the PLA units stationed in Beijing are carrying out this study with a heart full of infinite yearning for socialism. All units actively participate in listening to lectures and request higher authorities to send people down to convey the message. Xing Wanhai, a soldier from a certain unit of the North China Military Region, read the article "Take the Socialist Road" in the "North China Liberation Army" newspaper word by word several times, and copied the important paragraphs into his notebook. Commanders and fighters of various organs and units also frequently hold forums and discussions. The general line and general task of the state during the transition period have brought great encouragement and strength to commanders and fighters. The unanimous voice of the soldiers is: "The general line illuminates our hearts." A soldier from a hired laborer background said: "The realization of socialist industrialization by the state not only guarantees the modernization of national defense, but also can manufacture tractors to supply farmers, so agricultural production cooperatives will be more developed. In the future, the countryside will become agricultural cities. There will be cinemas, libraries, and everything else, that will be happiness."

    The broad masses of commanders and fighters universally support the state's measures to concentrate its main strength on developing heavy industry first. They said: "Heavy industry is the foundation of industrialization, and light industry is the branches and leaves. Without roots, how can branches grow? Even if a branch grows, it cannot withstand wind and rain." Sun Xiaoke, a soldier from a certain unit of the Public Security Forces, said: "Without heavy industry, we cannot make the planes and artillery we use, nor the machines for workers and tractors for farmers. Without heavy industry, we will be bullied by imperialism." Many soldiers from peasant backgrounds are particularly concerned about and supportive of the policy of socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts. They unanimously use their personal experiences and observations to prove that the road of mutual aid and cooperation for farmers is the most correct road. Soldier Guo Jicai said: "My brother joined an agricultural cooperative, and production is better than working alone. The road of mutual aid and cooperation is the right one. In the future, further collectivization and mechanization will be even happier, and the contribution to the country's industrialization will be even greater!"

    Encouraged by the beautiful prospects of the motherland, the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the broad masses of commanders and fighters have been greatly improved, and they have taken practical actions to implement the general line and general task of the state during the transition period. Wang Qi, a CCP member from a certain unit of the North China Military Region, said: "For the sake of socialism, I want to improve work efficiency and do two days' work in one day." Soldiers of the Public Security Forces who are responsible for guarding the central organs of the capital said: "We must do a better job of guarding the organs so that everyone can better lead the people of the whole country to completely realize the general line and general task." In the study, commanders and fighters realized that saving food is a long-term task for the state during the transition period, and they paid more attention to saving food. A certain unit of the Air Force stationed in Beijing specially held an exhibition of finely made coarse grain foods, promoting more than 100 methods of making coarse grains finely. The canteen of a certain unit of the North China Military Region paid great attention to saving food. There were no more phenomena of spilling food in the canteen, and many cadres and soldiers also wrote letters to mobilize their families to sell surplus grain to the state and purchase national economic construction bonds to help the country carry out industrial construction. The commanders and fighters of the PLA units stationed in Beijing are studying the general line and general task of the state during the transition period more deeply and actively, and are working hard to defend the country's advance towards socialism.

    Cadres and soldiers of the Northeast Military Region began to study the general line and general task of the state during the transition period with great enthusiasm. Starting from December 16th of last year, the Political Department of the Military Region concentrated the political commissars or directors of the political departments and the heads of the propaganda departments, sections, and offices of the major units of the troops. Zhang Xiushan, Deputy Political Commissar of the Military Region, and Gan Weihan, Minister of the Cadre Department, personally presided over the two-week study of the general line and general task. During the study, leading comrades of the Party and government in the Northeast Region were also invited to make special reports on the general line and general task. Currently, Zhang Xiushan, Second Deputy Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP and Deputy Political Commissar of the Northeast Military Region, and Zhang Mingyuan, Third Deputy Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP and Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, have successively made special reports. The cadres who participated in the training are developing in-depth study and research based on the various reports combined with reading documents.

    The wired broadcasting stations, troop reading organizations, and propaganda departments at all levels of the military region have begun to use various documents and propaganda materials on the general line and general task to carry out extensive publicity.

    In order to make this study organized and systematic in the troops, the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region issued instructions to all troops in early December of last year according to the instructions of the General Political Department of the Military Commission, determining that cadres in the entire military region this year will use one year, combined with Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the CPSU (B)" and related documents, to systematically and deeply study the general line and general task. The instructions also stipulated that from late December of last year to early February of this year, publicity and mobilization for studying the general line and general task should first be launched among cadres and soldiers in various troops to set off a study upsurge. The Party committees at all levels of the troops should convey the content and significance of the general line and general task level by level.

    中国人民解放军驻京各机关、部队
    热烈学习国家总路线总任务
    东北军区各部队开始学习过渡时期总路线
    中国人民解放军驻京各机关、部队正热烈地进行国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的学习。驻京各部队领导机关及中国共产党各部队委员会，都根据中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部的指示，对这一学习任务进行了具体布置，许多部队首长并亲自主持教育准备会或亲自讲课。各部队报纸和杂志也都相继发表了关于学习总路线和总任务的社论、刊登了简明的宣传要点、讲话材料等。有些单位并利用有线广播、图片和电影推动学习。
    解放军驻京各机关、部队的指挥员和战斗员们，怀着对社会主义无限向往的心情，进行这一学习。各单位踊跃参加听课，并请求上级派人下去传达。华北军区某部战士邢万海把“华北解放军”报上“走社会主义的路”一篇文章一字一句地读了好几遍，并把重要的段落抄在本子上。各机关、部队的指挥员、战斗员还经常举行座谈会、讨论会。国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，给指挥员和战斗员们带来巨大的鼓舞和力量。战士们一致的呼声是：“总路线把我们的心照亮了。”一个雇工出身的战士说：“国家实现了社会主义工业化，不仅国防现代化有了保证，而且能造拖拉机供给农民，农业生产合作社就更有发展了。将来农村就要成为农业城了。电影院，图书馆什么都有，那才幸福哩。”
    广大指挥员和战斗员们对国家首先集中主要力量发展重工业的措施普遍拥护。他们说：“重工业是工业化的根本，轻工业是枝梢。没有根哪能长枝？就是长个枝也经不起风吹雨打。”公安部队某部战士孙孝科说：“没有重工业就造不成我们使用的飞机、大炮，也没有工人用的机器和农民用的拖拉机。没有重工业就要受帝国主义的欺负。”许多农民出身的战士，对于对农业和手工业的社会主义改造的政策特别关心，特别拥护。他们一致以亲身的经历和见闻证明，农民走互助合作的道路是最正确的道路。战士郭记才说：“我哥哥参加了农业合作社，生产比单干搞的好。互助合作的道路是对的。将来进一步集体化机械化那就更幸福啦，对国家工业化的贡献也就更大啦！”
    在祖国美好远景的鼓舞下，广大指挥员和战斗员的积极性和责任心都大大提高，他们纷纷以实际行动贯彻国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务。华北军区某部中共党员王琦说：“为了社会主义，我要提高工作效率，一天干两天的工作。”担任首都中央机关警卫工作的公安部队战士说：“我们要更好地做好机关保卫工作，使大家更好地领导全国人民彻底实现总路线、总任务。”在学习中，指挥员和战斗员们认识到节约粮食是国家过渡时期长期的任务，他们更加注意节约粮食。解放军驻京空军部队某部特别举行了一次粗粮细作食品展览会，推广了一百多种粗粮细作的方法。华北军区某部食堂十分注意节约粮食，食堂中再也没有撒泼饭的现象了，很多干部、战士还写信动员家属将余粮卖给国家和购买国家经济建设公债，以帮助国家进行工业建设。解放军驻京部队的指挥员和战斗员们正更深入、积极地学习国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务，并为保卫国家向社会主义前进而努力。

    东北军区各部队干部和战士，以高度热情开始学习国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务。从去年十二月十六日开始，军区政治部集中了部队各大单位政治委员或政治部主任、宣传部、处、科长，由军区副政委张秀山和干部部部长甘渭汉同志亲自主持，进行历时两星期的总路线总任务学习。在学习中并邀请东北区党、行政领导同志作关于总路线总任务的专题报告。现中共中央东北局第二副书记、东北军区副政治委员张秀山、中共中央东北局第三副书记、东北行政委员会副主席张明远等同志，已先后作了专题报告。参加集训的干部，正根据各个报告结合阅读文件，展开深入的学习和研究。
    军区各部队的有线广播站、部队读报组织和各级宣传部门，已开始运用关于总路线总任务的各项文件和宣传材料，进行广泛的宣传。
    为了使这一学习在部队中有组织有系统地进行，东北军区政治部已于去年十二月初根据军委总政治部的指示向各部队发出指示，确定今年全军区干部将以一年时间，结合“联共（布）党史”第九章至十二章和有关文件，系统地深入地学习总路线总任务。指示并规定从去年十二月下旬至今年二月上旬期间，首先在各部队干部和战士中展开学习总路线总任务的宣传动员，掀起学习热潮，部队各级党委按级传达总路线总任务的内容和意义。
