    All-India Peace Council Meeting Passes Several Important Resolutions
    Demanding Easing of International Tensions, Opposing US-Pakistan Military Alliance
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 21st] The All-India Peace Council meeting recently held in Nagpur passed several resolutions demanding the easing of international tensions.
    According to TASS: The All-India Peace Council pointed out that the broad masses of the Indian people denounce the planned US-Pakistan military treaty. The Council believes that this treaty is part of the "US government's plan to seize world hegemony." The resolution passed by the Council on this issue stated that the United States "intends to use this treaty to exacerbate tensions between India and Pakistan, thereby gaining control over both countries."
    In the resolution on the "World Peace Congress," the All-India Peace Council warmly supports the World Peace Council's proposal to convene an international conference to ease international tensions. The resolution stated: "The recent situation in Asia and Europe shows that it is necessary to convene a conference to reflect the growing mass movement demanding the easing of international tensions through consultation. Today, more and more people, including clergy, cultural workers and political leaders, unanimously support the convening of such a conference." The All-India Peace Council also passed a resolution to convene a national conference to ease international tensions as a preparatory measure for the World Peace Congress.
    The All-India Peace Council also passed a general political resolution, which pointed out: There are still people in the world who are using the word "consultation" to speculate and prolong the "Cold War," and using various excuses to create new obstacles on the road to peace. The resolution also stated: "The atrocities of imperialist countries attempting to suppress colonial people are also a serious threat to world peace."
    In the resolution on the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, the All-India Peace Council expressed the hope that the Berlin Conference will "pave the way for easing current international tensions and resolving disputes between countries." The resolution emphasized: "The Indian people sincerely hope that after this conference, a five-power conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China will be held." The resolution pointed out: "Without the participation of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to solve basic international problems, especially those related to Asia. The Indian people hope that at the Berlin Conference, the representatives of the major powers will work with a sincere desire to negotiate, without setting any preconditions, and will dedicate themselves to the cause of resolving international outstanding issues; hope that they will discuss the establishment of a peaceful, unified, and democratic Germany, and take steps to unconditionally ban all weapons of mass destruction and implement universal disarmament."

    全印和平理事会会议通过多项重要决议
    要求缓和国际局势，反对美巴军事同盟
    【新华社二十一日讯】最近在那格浦尔举行的全印和平理事会会议曾通过多项决议，要求缓和国际紧张局势。
    据塔斯社报道：全印和平理事会指出，广大的印度人民都斥责策划中的美巴军事条约。理事会认为这个条约是“美国政府夺取世界霸权计划”的一部分。理事会就这个问题通过的决议说：美国“存心要利用这个条约来使印度和巴基斯坦之间的紧张局势恶化，从而取得对这两个国家的支配权。”
    在关于“世界和平大会”的决议中，全印和平理事会热烈支持世界和平理事会关于召开国际会议以缓和国际紧张局势的建议。决议说：“亚洲和欧洲最近的局势表明，必须召开一个会议，以反映要求通过协商来缓和国际紧张局势的日益高涨的群众运动。今天，愈来愈多的人，包括教士、文化工作者和政治领袖都一致支持召开这样的会议。”全印和平理事会并通过一项决议，决定召开一次缓和国际紧张局势的全国会议，作为召开世界和平大会的准备措施。
    全印和平理事会还通过了一个总政治决议，决议指出：世界上仍然有人在利用“协商”这个字眼来投机取巧，以延长“冷战”，并用各种借口在走向建立和平的道路上制造新的障碍。决议并说：“企图镇压殖民地人民的帝国主义国家的暴行，也是对世界和平的一个严重威胁。”
    在关于四国外长会议的决议中，全印和平理事会表示希望柏林会议将“为缓和目前国际紧张局势和解决各国间的争端开辟道路。”决议强调说：“印度人民衷心希望在这次会议之后，接着就召开一个有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议”。决议指出：“没有中华人民共和国参加，就不可能解决基本的国际问题，尤其是与亚洲有关的问题。印度人民希望：在柏林会议上，各大国的代表要以举行谈判的诚恳愿望，不提出任何先决条件，而致力于解决国际悬案的事业；希望他们讨论建立和平、统一和民主的德国的问题，并采取步骤来无条件禁止一切大规模毁灭性武器和实行普遍裁减军备。”
