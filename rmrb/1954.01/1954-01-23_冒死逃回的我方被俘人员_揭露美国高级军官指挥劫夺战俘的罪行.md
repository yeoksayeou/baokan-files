Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 21st: Our captured personnel, who risked death to escape from the 17th camp, the location of Kuomintang bandit gang special agent Wang Shunqing, during yesterday's violent abduction of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by American special agents, said after their return that American senior officers had directly planned this crime of kidnapping prisoners of war to the south.

According to the returnees, at 3:00 PM on the 19th, they saw Wang Shunqing and two "Garrison Captains" leave the camp in a jeep driven by an Indian. Later, one of the "Garrison Captains," Wang Mingsheng, told the prisoners of war that they were going to a meeting attended by the "Regimental" and "Battalion" commanders of each "Regiment." An American Major General, about fifty years old with graying hair, personally assigned them the task of forcibly escorting prisoners of war to the south at the meeting. The American Major General said that each camp must ensure that all prisoners of war were taken away on the 20th, with no one missing. If anyone was missing, the "Regimental" and "Battalion" commanders would be fully responsible. The American Major General also ordered the special agents in each camp to divide the prisoners of war into groups of twenty-five, assign specific personnel, carry weapons, and monitor "wavering elements."

At noon on the 20th, the special agents of the 17th camp precisely followed the instructions of the American Major General in dragging the prisoners of war away. Those who had previously expressed their desire to return home were dragged onto American cars by two special agents holding their arms.

The returnees said that the special agents' preparations for kidnapping prisoners of war had begun long ago. As early as the beginning of January, the American authorities, through Taiwanese special agents in the American 64th Field Hospital, sent Wang Shunqing an American-made telescope. Wang Shunqing used to stand on the earthen platform of the camp every day to watch the American positions only a few hundred meters away from the 17th camp, observing the roads for the abduction of prisoners of war. On January 15th, Wang Shunqing went to other camps to "speak." On the same day, the hospital's special agents sent Wang Shunqing the "Hanzi No. 8 Secret Order" from the Kuomintang special agent agency in Seoul. Wang Shunqing had used a loudspeaker to transmit the "Secret Order" to other camps. The returnees clearly remembered that the general idea of the "order" was: when the prisoners of war were escorted out of the camp, they should follow one another, not fall behind, not look left or right, and not talk to the Indians. Personnel above the "Squad Leader" level and "Garrison Members" should all carry wooden sticks, broadswords, or "Molotov cocktails" made by filling empty cans with gasoline. Each "Squad" also had to make two stretchers. If anyone was found wanting to return home, they should be injured on the spot, then carried away on a stretcher and killed after arriving in the South Korean area.

From January 17th, Wang Shunqing stayed by the radio all night, waiting for instructions from the American and Chiang Kai-shek special agent agencies. The large and small special agents in the camp were also busy, running back and forth, forcing the prisoners of war in the iron and woodworking "Squad" to work overnight to rush-produce stretchers, wooden sticks, and "Molotov cocktails," and forcing the prisoners of war to conduct multiple drills and exhausting runs. Each drill was personally commanded by Wang. Bandit Wang had more than once used a loudspeaker to tell other camps that the camp he "led" would never have problems.

Although the special agents carried out frantic activities, they could not stop the prisoners of war's longing for their motherland. Late at night on the 19th, when they heard the letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, they all secretly shed tears. The returnees said that this was the first time they had heard the voice of their motherland in more than two years, greatly encouraging their courage to break through the control of the special agents. The special agents were very afraid of our broadcast and immediately ordered the bugle to be blown, forcing the prisoners of war to sing, beat gasoline drums, and increased the number of sentries in front of the barbed wire.

Despite the special agents' elaborate arrangements, twenty-nine of our prisoners of war risked death to escape from the 17th camp during yesterday's escort of prisoners of war to the south. Each returnee named many companions who wanted to return home. They said that the prisoners of war all wanted to return home, but they just didn't have the opportunity. The returnees personally saw that when the prisoners of war were escorted out of the camp yesterday, they all lowered their heads and were silently filled with infinite pain.

    冒死逃回的我方被俘人员
    揭露美国高级军官指挥劫夺战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城二十一日电】在昨天美方特务用暴力押走朝中战俘的过程中，从国民党匪帮特务头子王顺清所在的第十七号营场冒死逃回的我方被俘人员在归来后说，美国高级军官事先直接布置了这次绑架战俘南行的罪行。
    据归来人员说，在十九日下午三时，他们看见王顺清和两个“警备队长”坐着印度人开的吉普车离开营场。后来“警备队长”之一王明生对战俘说，他们是出去开会的，到会的有各“联队”的“联队长”和“大队长”。一个大约五十多岁、头发灰白的美国少将在会上亲自给他们布置暴力挟持战俘南行的工作。美国少将说，各营场要保证在二十日把全部战俘带走，一个人也不准少，如果少了人，各“联队长”和“大队长”要负完全责任。美国少将又命令各营场的特务把战俘分编成二十五人一组，指定专人，携带武器，监视“动摇分子”。
    二十日中午，十七号营场的特务正是按照美国少将的指示把战俘架走的。有些过去流露过回国愿望的人，都是由两个特务拉着两个胳膊架上美国汽车的。
    归来人员说：特务绑架战俘的准备工作早就开始了。早在一月初，美军当局就通过美军第六十四野战医院中的台湾特务，给王顺清送来一个美国造的望远镜，王顺清就天天站在营场的土台上观看仅距十七号营场数百公尺的美军阵地，观看劫持战俘行走的道路。一月十五日，王顺清到其他营场去“讲话”。同日，医院的特务给王顺清送来汉城国民党特务机关的“汉字第八号密令”，王顺清曾派人用扬声筒把该“密令”传到其他营场。归来人员还清楚地记得该“命令”的大意是：战俘被押出营场时，要一个跟一个，不准掉队，不准左右观看，不准和印度人讲话，“小队长”以上人员和“警备队员”都要拿木棒、大刀或空罐头装进汽油做成的“燃烧弹”。每个“小队”还要做两付担架。凡是发现有人想回国，当场把他打伤，然后用担架抬走，到南朝鲜地区后再将他弄死。
    从一月十七日起，王顺清就整夜守在电台旁边，等候美蒋特务机关的指令。营场里的大小特务也是忙忙碌碌，来回奔跑，强迫铁木工“小队”的战俘连夜赶制担架、木棒和“燃烧弹”，并强迫战俘进行多次演习和疲劳跑步。每次演习，都由王顺清亲自指挥。王匪曾不止一次用扬声筒向别的营场说，他“领导”的营场绝不会发生问题。
    虽然特务疯狂进行活动，但是并不能阻止战俘们怀念祖国的心情。十九日深夜，他们听到了我方广播的朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员给朝中被俘人员的信时，都暗暗流下了眼泪。归来人员说，这是两年多来第一次听到祖国的声音，大大鼓舞了他们冲出特务控制的勇气。特务很害怕我方的广播，立刻命令吹号，强迫战俘唱歌，敲打汽油桶，并在铁丝网跟前增加了岗哨。
    尽管特务作了种种周密布置，昨天押解战俘南行过程中，第十七号营场就有二十九名我方战俘冒死逃了出来。每个归来人员都说出许多想要回国的同伴的名字。他们说，战俘们都是要回国的，就是没有机会。归来人员亲眼看到，战俘们昨天在被押出营场时，都低着头，沉默地怀着无限痛苦的心情。
