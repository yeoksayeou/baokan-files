Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 9th (TASS dispatch): The Bulgarian Council of Ministers has passed a resolution on improving the work of machine tractor stations, state farms, and agricultural machine repair factories.

    The resolution stipulates that agricultural work should be further mechanized. By the end of 1957, the mechanization of agricultural work should reach the following levels: at least 75 percent for autumn plowing, 60 percent for spring plowing, 90 percent for threshing, 60 percent for inter-row cultivation, and 50 percent for silage making. In order to provide technical assistance to agricultural production cooperatives, the resolution stipulates that a permanent agronomist will be stationed in every one to two agricultural production cooperatives. From January 1954, the wages of tractor drivers, other workers in tractor teams, and experts at machine tractor stations will be increased. By the end of 1957, 200 agricultural engineers and mechanics will also be assigned to work at machine tractor stations. In order to improve the skills of the staff at machine tractor stations, the resolution instructs the directors of each machine tractor station to hold two-month winter training courses. The resolution also stipulates a large-scale capital construction plan. The plan stipulates that each machine tractor station will have a repair factory. In 1954, 40 repair factories will be established. In addition to domestically produced agricultural machinery, by the end of 1957, 13,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) will be ordered from abroad. In 1954, 550 combine harvesters and 1,300 tractors will be ordered from abroad.

    保部长会议决议进一步实现农业机械化
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社索非亚九日讯：保加利亚部长会议通过了一项关于改进机器拖拉机站、国营农场和农业机器修配厂的工作的决议。
    决议规定要把农业工作进一步机械化。到一九五七年年底，农业工作的机械化应达到如下程度：秋耕工作至少达百分之七十五，春耕工作达百分之六十，打谷工作达百分之九十，中耕工作达百分之六十，饲料青贮工作达百分之五十。为了给予农业生产合作社以技术上的帮助，决议规定在每一个到两个农业生产合作社内派驻一个固定的农艺学家。从一九五四年一月起，将提高拖拉机手、拖拉机工作队的其他工作人员和机器拖拉机站的专家的工资。到一九五七年年底，还将分派二百个农业工程师和机械师到机器拖拉机站工作。为了提高机器拖拉机站工作人员的水平，决议责成各机器拖拉机站站长举办为期两月的冬季训练班。决议同时规定了基本建设的庞大计划。计划规定：每一个机器拖拉机站都将设有一个修配厂。在一九五四年内，将建立四十个修配厂。除国产农业机器外，到一九五七年年底，将向国外订购一万三千部拖拉机（每部以十五匹马力计算）。一九五四年将向国外订购五百五十部联合机和一千三百部拖拉机。
