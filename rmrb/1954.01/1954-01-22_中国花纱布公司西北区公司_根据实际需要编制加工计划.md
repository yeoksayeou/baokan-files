    China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation Northwest District Company
    Develops Processing Plans According to Actual Needs
    Staff members of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation Northwest District Company, in conjunction with studying the general line of the state during the transition period, formulated the 1954 textile printing and dyeing processing plan, reducing the blindness in plan formulation.
    When formulating the plan, the company first fully considered the necessity of balancing the yarn and cloth produced by various yarn mills in the Northwest with national adjustments and actively utilized existing equipment capacity to meet the needs of the masses. Based on the increased purchasing power of the people in the Northwest, the company coordinated with the production plan of various textile printing and dyeing factories to expand the yarn and cloth processing plan. The planned output of cotton cloth from state-owned textile factories in the Northwest in the first half of this year will increase by 129% compared to the first half of last year. To meet the needs of consumers in the region and other regions, all looms in various textile factories will not only produce a large quantity of twelve-pound cloth but will also produce new people's cloth, fourteen-pound coarse cloth, printed crepe, coarse and fine twill grey cloth, and so on.
    When formulating the plan, the company also considered the imbalance between the small printing and dyeing equipment capacity and the large textile capacity of various printing and dyeing factories in the Northwest. To improve printing and dyeing capacity, in addition to actively suggesting that the textile printing and dyeing industries of the textile sector must be closely integrated and striving to establish new factories in advance, it was also decided to establish processing relationships with the private Dadong Dyeing Factory starting in 1954. The planned output of printed and colored cloth in the first half of this year will increase by 46.7% compared to the second half of last year, and improvements in the printing and dyeing quality of cotton cloth are required. In addition, after research by the company's planning and business departments, the processing plan also appropriately increased the production of fourteen-pound coarse cloth to meet the needs of farmers.
    While formulating the plan, attention was also paid to strengthening the leadership of the handicraft weaving industry. According to statistics, there are more than 1,800 hand looms in Xi'an, all of which have accepted processing orders from the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and can produce about 790,000 bolts of various cloths each year. These cloths still have a certain market in rural areas. The company will continue to maintain processing relationships with the hand weaving industry this year, but in the future, in addition to utilizing its production capacity to meet the needs of the people, it will also steadily transform them to gradually guide the hand weaving industry towards the path of cooperation.

    中国花纱布公司西北区公司
    根据实际需要编制加工计划
    中国花纱布公司西北区公司工作人员，结合学习国家过渡时期的总路线，编制出一九五四年度纺织印染加工计划，减少了编制计划的盲目性。
    该公司在编制计划时，首先充分考虑了西北各纱厂所产纱布和全国调剂平衡的必要性，并积极发挥现有设备能力，以满足群众的需要。根据西北人民购买力的提高，该公司配合各纺织印染厂生产计划的编制，扩大了纱布加工计划。西北国营各纺织厂今年上半年棉布的计划产量将比去年上半年增加百分之一百二十九。为了供应区内和其他地区消费者需要，今年各纺织厂所有布机除大量生产十二磅布外，并织制新人民市布、十四磅粗布、印花哔叽、粗细斜坯布等。
    在制订计划时，该公司又考虑到了西北各印染厂印染设备能力小和纺织能力大的不平衡问题。为了提高印染能力，除积极建议纺织部门的纺织印染工业必须密切结合，并争取提前建立新厂外，还决定从一九五四年起和私营大东染厂建立加工关系。今年上半年花、色布的加工计划产量将比去年下半年增加百分之四十六点七，并要求研究改进和提高棉布的印染质量。此外，经过该公司计划和业务部门的研究，加工计划中还适当地增加了十四磅粗布的生产，以适应农民需要。
    在制订计划的同时，还注意到加强对手工织布业的领导，据统计西安市有手工织机一千八百余台，已全部接受花纱布公司的加工订货，每年可生产各种布约七十九万疋，这些布疋在农村仍有一定市场，该公司在今年仍将与手织业继续维持加工关系，但今后除利用其生产能力以满足人民需要外，另一方面并将稳步地对他们进行改造，以逐步引导手织业走向合作化的道路。　（张宝林）
