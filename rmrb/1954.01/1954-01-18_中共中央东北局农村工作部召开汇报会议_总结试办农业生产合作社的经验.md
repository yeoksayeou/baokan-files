Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 17th: The Rural Work Department of the CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau held a regional mutual aid and cooperation reporting meeting in early January to review the trial operation of agricultural production cooperatives in 1953 and the pilot work of establishing cooperatives this year, and exchanged experiences in establishing cooperatives.

According to the reports, the vast majority of the 4,872 agricultural production cooperatives (including those piloted at the county level in 1952) established on a trial basis in Northeast China in 1953 were successful and played a role in "key pilot projects and typical demonstrations." At the same time, various localities have also trained a certain number of district and village cadres and accumulated experience in running cooperatives, creating favorable conditions for the development of agricultural production cooperatives in the entire region. Regarding the development of agricultural production cooperatives this year, various localities have completed pilot work and gained experience. However, the meeting believes that there are some shortcomings and problems in both the cooperative establishment work in 1953 and the pilot work of establishing cooperatives this year. The main problems are: in the 1953 cooperative establishment work, only a part of the members of the CCP county committees and district committees participated, and a small number of county party secretaries did not participate in this work in person due to insufficient understanding. In the work of district-run cooperatives, although the policy of "collective leadership, special person in charge, and everyone studying" was put forward by the CCP district committee, most districts did not implement it well. Little was taught to the CCP village branches about the principles, policies, and methods of running cooperatives, forming a tendency of "county and district run, branch watch," and insufficient attention was paid to cultivating the CCP village branch into the core force leading agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, the development and experience of leadership forces at the county, district, and village levels lag behind the needs of the development of agricultural production cooperatives. In this year's pilot work of establishing cooperatives, after overcoming the conservative thinking of "insufficient understanding and insufficient drive" in individual areas, there was also impatience and rashness; in practice, there were shortcomings of sloppiness and simplification, which affected the consolidation of newly established cooperatives.

Finally, Zhao Dezun, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau, made a summary. In his summary report, in addition to affirming the achievements of the cooperative establishment work in 1953 and the pilot work of establishing cooperatives this year, he focused on analyzing the favorable conditions for the more than 7,700 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Northeast China this year, and explained that after these cooperatives are built, there will be more than 12,500 cooperatives in the entire region, with an average of one cooperative in every two villages. The influence of agricultural production cooperatives among farmers will be further expanded, which will further promote the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement in Northeast China. He asked all localities to clearly understand the principle that running agricultural production cooperatives well can drive the great development of mutual aid groups, and therefore, it is necessary to consolidate and improve the existing agricultural production cooperatives and conscientiously run the new cooperatives well. All localities should sum up and apply the past experience in establishing and running cooperatives, correctly implement various policies, raise the banner of agricultural production cooperatives higher, and lead farmers to move steadily forward along the direction pointed out by the general line. He also emphasized that whether the cooperative establishment and operation work is done well or not, training cadres is a key issue. He asked all localities to do a good job in training cadres in conjunction with the current cooperative operation work in order to prepare leadership forces for the future implementation of collectivization in rural areas. Zhao Dezun asked all localities to pay attention to strengthening the leadership of mutual aid groups while running agricultural production cooperatives well, because mutual aid groups are still the majority and are the basis for future development into agricultural production cooperatives. In addition, he asked all localities to properly handle the problem of 620 (previously mistakenly reported as 420) spontaneous agricultural production cooperatives.

    中共中央东北局农村工作部召开汇报会议
    总结试办农业生产合作社的经验
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】中共中央东北局农村工作部在一月上旬召开全区互助合作汇报会议，对一九五三年试办农业生产合作社和今年建社试点工作进行了检查，并交流了建社的经验。
    根据汇报，东北区一九五三年试办的四千八百七十二个农业生产合作社（其中并包括一九五二年县级试办的在内），绝大多数是成功的，起到了“重点试办、典型示范”的作用。同时，各地也培养了一定数量的区干部和村干部，积累了办社的经验，为全区发展农业生产合作社的工作创造了有利条件。关于今年发展农业生产合作社的工作，各地已完成试点工作，并取得了经验。但会议认为：一九五三年办社和今年建社试点工作中，都存在着一些缺点和问题。其中主要的问题是：一九五三年办社工作中，中共县委会、区委会只有一部分委员参加，并有少数县委书记由于认识不足，没有亲自参加这一工作。在区办社的工作上，虽然提出中共区委会要实行“集体领导，专人负责，大家学习”的方针，但多数区没有很好贯彻。对中共村支部很少传授办社的方针、政策和方法，形成“县、区办，支部看”的偏向，对于把中共村支部培养成为领导农业生产合作社的核心力量重视不够。因此，县、区、村领导力量的发展和经验，落后于农业生产合作社发展的需要。在今年的建社试点工作中，个别地区克服了“认识不足、劲头不够”的保守思想后，又产生了急躁冒进情绪；在作法上，发生了草率和简单化的缺点，影响新建社的巩固。
    会议最后由中共中央东北局农村工作部部长赵德尊作了总结。他在总结报告中，除了肯定一九五三年办社和今年建社试点工作的成绩外，着重分析了东北区今年新建七千七百多个农业生产合作社的有利条件，并说明这些社建成后，全区将有一万二千五百多个社，平均每两个村有一个社，农业生产合作社在农民中的影响将更加扩大，将进一步促进东北区农业互助合作运动的发展。他要求各地明确认识办好农业生产合作社可以带动互助组的大发展的道理，因而必须巩固提高现有的农业生产合作社，并切实办好新社。各地应很好地总结和运用过去的建社和办社经验，正确地贯彻各项政策，把农业生产合作社的旗帜举得更高，带领农民沿着总路线所指的方向稳步前进。他还强调指出：建社和办社工作做得好坏，培养干部是一个关键问题。他要求各地，必须结合目前的办社工作，把培养干部工作做好，以为将来农村实行合作化准备领导力量。赵德尊提请各地注意在办好农业生产合作社的同时，要加强对互助组的领导，因为互助组还是多数，而且是将来发展成为农业生产合作社的基础。此外，他要求各地很好地处理六百二十多个（前误为四百二十多个）自发的农业生产合作社的问题。
