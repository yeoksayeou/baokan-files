    Cultivating New Socialist People
    ——Report at the Second National Conference on Children's Work
    Hu Keshi
    (I)
    In the past four years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our people have carried out the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, the social democratic reform movement, and the work of restoring and developing the national economy, and have achieved great victories and achievements in politics, economy, and culture, laying a solid foundation for the happy life and bright future of the younger generation. The Party and the government have given deep care to the younger generation of children, expanding and adding many primary and secondary schools. At present, the number of primary school students nationwide has more than doubled compared to the highest number before liberation, and the number of middle school students has increased by more than 50 percent. Teachers, after successive patriotic mass movements and ideological remolding, have generally improved their political level and made progress in teaching. Many cultural institutions and entertainment venues have gradually added children's departments, such as children's libraries, reading rooms, stadiums, swimming pools, parks, as well as children's theaters, and children's programs on radio stations, which have provided better conditions for children's education.
    In 1949, the Party entrusted the Youth League to establish the Chinese Young Pioneers (now renamed the Chinese Young Pioneers), to unite and educate the vast number of children. In April 1950, the Central Committee of the Youth League convened the First National Conference of Cadres on Children's Work, which determined the work policy and construction steps of the team. Thanks to the joint efforts of the Youth League committees and counselors at all levels, as well as the care and support of all parties over the past four years, the work of the Young Pioneers has achieved certain results. We already have seven million Young Pioneers and a team of 160,000 Young Pioneer counselors. The Young Pioneers, in coordination with school education, have carried out various beneficial activities suitable for the age characteristics of children. During the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, children in various places communicated and held parties with the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army, tried various ways to donate airplanes and artillery, and comforted the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. During the 1952 Spring Festival, 830,000 children across the country participated in the "Spring Festival Comfort Movement for Families of Martyrs and Soldiers," which won unanimous praise from the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and the broad masses, who said they were "good children nurtured by Chairman Mao." In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call to "study hard," many team organizations, through visits to factories and rural areas, meetings with heroes, models, writers, and scientists, as well as team meetings with certain themes, such as "The Value of Forty-Five Minutes," "How Important Arithmetic Is," and "What Can We Learn from Zoya," have inspired children's interest and consciousness in learning, and played a positive role in cultivating children's self-discipline and improving academic performance. Some places have also carried out various extracurricular research group activities, making various specimens, models, and charts, and giving play to children's creativity. Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places have held city-wide gatherings of young scientists, and one gathering in Shanghai exhibited 750 scientific instruments, models, and specimens created by children themselves. In various activities, children's new ideological qualities have gradually grown, and good behaviors such as cherishing public property, returning lost items, helping the elderly and young, and helping parents with labor are very common. The phenomena of carving desks and chairs and breaking glass in schools have been greatly reduced. Many children, seeing leaking public water pipes, try to block them or run to the police station to report them, and rural children consciously avoid taking shortcuts to avoid trampling crops. Many people say, "Children become better when they wear the red scarf."
    We have created national team newspapers for children - "Chinese Young Pioneers" and "Middle School Students," "New Young Pioneers," "Good Children," "Red Scarf," and other children's newspapers and periodicals. At present, there are three types of children's newspapers and eight types of publications nationwide. "Chinese Young Pioneers" has sold more than one million copies, and the total circulation of other newspapers and periodicals is more than 700,000 copies. They are warmly welcomed by children and have become powerful tools for educating children.
    Every year during the June 1st International Children's Day and during vacations, Youth League organizations in various places actively promote relevant departments to organize celebrations for children and summer camps, summer paradises, etc. In a few cities with conditions, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, children's extracurricular education institutions such as children's palaces and children's homes have begun to be established. This enriches children's spare-time cultural life, increases their knowledge and health, and makes them deeply feel the care of the motherland.
    In general, in the past four years, we have established the organization of the Young Pioneers, explored and created some work experiences suitable for China's social conditions and the age characteristics of children, and helped schools educate children. The Young Pioneers has become an organization loved by the vast number of children and praised by schools, families, and all sectors of society, proving that the Young Pioneers is an indispensable part of the school's implementation of new education. This has laid a good foundation for future work.
    However, there are still many shortcomings and problems in our work. Because the work of the Young Pioneers is in its initial stage and lacks experience, and because many Youth League committees have been busy with central work in the past and lack the necessary attention and leadership to the work of the Young Pioneers, and the work of training counselors has not been done enough, therefore, many cadres and counselors still lack a clear understanding of the nature and tasks of the team and the correct views and methods of children's education. The activities of the team still have the tendency to be boring, poor, and adult-like, and they are not good at carrying out work according to the age characteristics of children and in coordination with school education. Some erroneous educational views and methods have not been corrected in a timely and effective manner. We must consolidate the achievements we have made, overcome the existing shortcomings, and further strengthen leadership in order to do the work of children better.
    (II)
    Our country has entered a new historical period. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are struggling to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, so as to build our country into a great socialist country. Children are the future of the country. They will take over our cause and hold the banner of socialism and communism to the final victory. Therefore, caring for children and educating children is a task with great national significance and is the common responsibility and virtue of the people of New China.
    The socialist social system and a high level of production require its builders to be new people with all-round development in intelligence, morality, physique, and aesthetics. They should be collectivists, fighters dedicated to the happiness of all mankind and the people of our country, not narrow-minded and vulgar egoists; people who love labor and are full of creativity, not lazy, conservative, and obsequious people; people with a high level of cultural and scientific knowledge, not empty-headed and unlearned people; people who are full of vitality, tenacious, and strong, not rigid, weak, and listless people. Therefore, to educate children in the spirit of communism and cultivate them into outstanding children of the new China who love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, protect public property, are healthy, lively, brave, and honest is the basic task of children's work. And this task is even more important today.
    Schools bear the primary responsibility for cultivating and educating the new generation. The Young Pioneers plays an important role in this cause. Lenin once said: "Children's organizations - this is a good way to educate communists." Because, in their own organizations, children elect their own leaders and jointly organize various beneficial activities, so that they are accustomed from an early age to aligning their own goals and actions with the goals and actions of the collective, and are accustomed to constantly caring about the interests of the collective. Moreover, the Young Pioneers has set a common goal for children to strive for—to strive for the cause of building the motherland and for realizing Chairman Mao's great ideals, which can enable them to gradually learn to subordinate all actions to this goal, thereby developing a conscious attitude towards learning, work, and life, and training themselves to become people with clear goals and strong will. The facts are exactly like this. In the past four years, the work of the Young Pioneers has not only cultivated children's patriotism, broadened children's horizons, and enriched children's knowledge, but also greatly helped schools in inspiring and cultivating children's initiative, enthusiasm, creativity, and collectivism. Therefore, the Young Pioneers is an indispensable part of school education. Schools should care about and guide the work of the Young Pioneers. At the same time, when carrying out work, the Young Pioneers must also clarify that the school is the main front for educating children, and the work of the Young Pioneers must obey the tasks of school education. According to the intentions of the school's teaching work and the actual situation of the children, organize various activities suitable for children's interests and requirements, and better help children accept school education and complete learning tasks. It is wrong to deviate from the tasks of school education and not proceed from the actual situation of children, and to engage in activities for the sake of activities; it is also wrong to not understand that the Young Pioneers is children's own organization, to use administrative orders to lead the team's activities, to repeat and extend regular classes in the team's activities, and to replace administrative and teachers' work.
    In order to correctly cultivate and educate children, the content and methods of the Young Pioneers' work should also meet the requirements of children's physical and mental development, and should meet the age characteristics of children. First, children are in a period of growth and development, and all aspects are not mature, and it takes a long period of cultivation and education to gradually become fixed. Therefore, this requires workers in children's work to set an example in everything and use their own exemplary behavior to influence and educate children. And we must use more positive methods to enlighten, persuade, demonstrate, and put forward certain practical requirements..., and carry out education repeatedly, meticulously, and patiently. We should neither adopt rough and impatient methods, nor put forward tasks and requirements that they are not suitable to shoulder. In the past, some schools and Young Pioneer organizations conducted ideological self-criticism among children, carried out "small three-anti" campaigns, held criticism and struggle sessions, and satirized and attacked children who made mistakes or had shortcomings; some selected models among children and used stimulating competition methods to impatiently demand progress from children, or implemented compulsory learning mutual assistance, requiring children to "guarantee teaching and learning"; some simply used children and subjectively required Young Pioneers to take the lead in everything and play a guarantee role, causing children to bear too many and too heavy political and production tasks. These erroneous practices that do not proceed from education cannot only fail to achieve results, but also have great harm to the normal development of children. Second, children lack basic knowledge. When conducting education, we must proceed from children's knowledge level and comprehension ability, and use more vivid and concrete facts to explain problems, so that they can gradually improve their understanding from the concrete examples and images they directly perceive. Do not generally talk about many abstract great principles, and there should be different levels of content and different requirements for children of different ages. The forms of activities must be diverse and interesting, and not old-fashioned. At present, the shortcomings in our work include treating children as adults, such as giving children lengthy and abstract reports lasting two or three hours, asking children to discuss issues that are difficult for them to understand, such as "Opposing Liberalism," "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists," and "The Ten Major Policies of Agricultural Production," as well as activities that are too complicated and lengthy, making children overburdened and difficult to accept; another shortcoming is that the content is poor and the methods are simple, failing to give children new things and failing to meet the requirements for children's physical and intellectual development. These shortcomings need to be improved. Third, children must develop and grow in an all-round way, and their interests and requirements are also multifaceted. Therefore, the education and cultivation of children should also be multifaceted. In the past, some schools and Young Pioneer organizations, while helping children to do well in their studies, neglected to conduct patriotic political and ideological education for children, so that major events such as the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month, the Korean Armistice, and the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel were not given the necessary education to children. How can we cultivate people who love the motherland and are truly knowledgeable? Some also neglected to carry out cultural and sports activities, so that children's spare-time life was unusually poor and boring, which often affected children's classroom learning. It should be understood that intelligence, morality, physique, and aesthetics cannot be neglected. Only comprehensive cultivation and enrichment of children's lives can enable every aspect of them to be fully developed and become new-type people. Fourth, the activities of the Young Pioneers should be based on children's initiative and creativity. We should trust children, respect children, and guide and help them to carry out activities themselves and succeed in doing things with their own strength. Some people do not trust the power of children. When organizing children's activities, they take care of everything, from arranging the venue, inviting people to give lectures, and drafting the chairman's speech. Even more people adopt passive restrictions and constraints on children, requiring children to be "civilized and well-behaved," "honest and obedient," and "not allowed to jump when walking, and not allowed to laugh when watching plays." Obviously, it is impossible to cultivate children into people who are proactive, brave, lively, and have self-esteem and self-confidence in this way.
    So, how should the Young Pioneers conduct education for children in coordination with schools according to the age characteristics of children?
    First, the Young Pioneers should educate and help children study hard, abide by discipline, and fight for excellent academic results and the acquisition of rich knowledge. The Young Pioneers organizations can use a variety of activities such as visits, meetings with heroic model figures, storytelling, watching movies, and holding team meetings with certain themes to inspire children's interest in learning and desire for knowledge, clarify the meaning of learning various subjects, cultivate children's learning consciousness and sense of responsibility, and educate children to listen carefully in class, complete homework seriously, and have persistence and the spirit of overcoming difficulties. The Young Pioneers organizations can also promote subject gatherings, organize various research groups, make models, specimens, machines, and charts, observe and record natural phenomena, cultivate flowers and trees, and raise small animals to expand and deepen classroom knowledge and cultivate children's interest in science. Books are the source of knowledge. The Young Pioneers organizations should publicize the role of "books," introduce books to children; hold reading clubs, story meetings, poetry recitations, and meetings with writers to guide children in reading and cultivate children's requirement to read frequently, so that they can acquire rich knowledge.
    Second, the Young Pioneers should help schools and teachers in conducting patriotic political and ideological education for children and cultivating children's moral qualities. The Young Pioneers should often help children understand the history of the motherland, understand the great construction cause and socialist future of the motherland, understand the achievements of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and understand the struggle of the people of all ethnic groups for peace and democracy through various vivid and imageful activities, in order to cultivate children's patriotism and internationalism, and encourage children to study, work, and live better in order to build a socialist motherland and for the beautiful future of mankind.
    The Young Pioneers should help children gradually become familiar with the life and deeds of the leaders, and use the examples of the leaders' heroic struggle for the happiness of the people and for the cause of communism to educate the younger generation; they should use the stories and biographies of heroic model figures, outstanding scientists, writers..., to educate children, so that children can learn from them, and they should attach importance to organizing children's activities on revolutionary anniversaries, helping children gradually become familiar with revolutionary traditions and the Party's cause; they should familiarize themselves with the Youth League and prepare to participate in the Youth League through various activities and specific examples; they should pay attention to cultivating children's correct attitude towards comrades, labor, and public interests, as well as honesty, bravery, liveliness, and the spirit of enterprise in various activities and children's daily study, work, and life.
    Third, the Young Pioneers organizations should strengthen the labor education of children. Labor is an honorable cause in our country, because socialism is to be built by the labor of hundreds of millions of people. We should educate children to love labor, prepare to participate in industrial and agricultural production labor, respect working people, cherish the fruits of labor, and cultivate their habit of engaging in physical labor regularly. Under the conditions that do not hinder learning and health, some social work and public labor that children can do and are beneficial should be organized appropriately, such as comforting the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, cultivating campuses, sorting and repairing books, making teaching aids for schools, helping agricultural and forestry departments plant trees and protect forests..., etc. We can also promote appropriate contacts between urban and rural children, mutual service, and gifts of local products and self-made gifts. Team members and children should be educated to do their own affairs in life and help with housework at home. These appropriate social work are of great educational significance for increasing children's knowledge and abilities, cultivating children's collectivist thoughts and feelings and love for labor.
    Fourth, the Young Pioneers organizations should assist schools in carrying out children's sports activities in many ways, such as gymnastics, skating, swimming, mountain climbing, boating, organizing marches, trips, military sports games and competitions, holding various ball games and chess games, sports meets and sports performances, etc. We should also promote various spare-time games suitable for children, such as skipping rope, kicking shuttlecock, kicking football, and overlord whip, to exercise children's strong, lively, brave, and tenacious physique and will. We must also educate children to abide by the work and rest system and develop hygienic habits.
    Fifth, the Young Pioneers organizations should pay attention to cultivating children's interest in literature and art and develop children's talents in art. Literary and artistic activities play an important role in enlightening wisdom and cultivating character. Children's cultural and entertainment activities should be widely carried out, such as chorus, group dance, poetry recitation, and holding literary evenings. We should also organize various music, dance, painting, art, embroidery and other groups for children according to different interests under possible conditions. And we should cultivate children's aesthetic views in children's various activities and daily life.
    In short, we must carry out the activities of the Young Pioneers in accordance with the policy of all-round development of intelligence, morality, physique, and aesthetics, according to the age characteristics of children, and in coordination with school education, so as to correctly cultivate and educate children. We must constantly publicize and promote good experiences that conform to communist educational ideas, use criticism and self-criticism methods to overcome those incorrect and feudal and bourgeois educational views and methods, and constantly improve our work level, and strive to cultivate new socialist people!
    (III)
    The Young Pioneers organization has developed to seven million people. It is already a national-scale organization loved by children. In order to better unite and educate the vast number of children, we must further do a good job in the organizational development of the Young Pioneers.
    In the past few years, the development work of the Young Pioneers organization has been successful, but there are also many problems. The main problem is that some local Youth League committees lack the necessary leadership for the team building work. Therefore, the organizations of some teams were established spontaneously, some do not have counselors, and some, although they have counselors, do not know how to work because they do not have leadership. At the same time, there is a general lack of attention to the work of frequently developing team members in the team building schools. In many places, there are also phenomena of excessive entry requirements and cumbersome procedures, which hinder the role of the Young Pioneers in uniting and educating the vast number of children.
    On the issue of the organizational development of the Young Pioneers, on the one hand, it should be seen that the Young Pioneers is a broad-based children's organization, and the vast number of children are eagerly hoping to join the team. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the team organization in a planned way and gradually absorb the vast number of children into the team organization. On the other hand, the purpose of building the team is to better educate children. Therefore, there must be appropriate people to lead, so that children can be educated from the application to join the team until after joining the team. Without appropriate people to lead, the team will be built only in form and will not achieve the purpose of educating children. According to the current main situation in various places and our existing experience and lessons, the organizational development policy of the Young Pioneers in the future should be: adopt a positive attitude, distinguish different situations, and gradually develop the team organization with leadership and in a planned way.
    Building a team must have two conditions: First, the Youth League committee must have someone in charge, and second, the team building school must have appropriate candidates who can serve as the general counselor and the squadron counselor. Therefore, in large and medium-sized cities where the Youth League committee has someone in charge, the main task is to actively train counselors and carry out team building work in a planned and step-by-step manner. In rural areas, the Youth League county committee that does not have anyone in charge of children's work should designate someone to be responsible for this work; if there was not much development in the past, they should find out the situation of the schools and gradually build teams in schools with conditions; if there has been a lot of development in the past, but there has been no leadership for a long time, then the leadership of the schools that have already built teams should be strengthened first, counselors should be trained, and team activities should be carried out, and then teams should be gradually built in other schools with conditions. For the team organizations that were spontaneously established in the past, we should actively discuss with relevant parties, select and hire counselors, and lead them. We must not adopt the methods of "reorganizing the team" and simply disbanding the team. The Youth League committees of all provinces, cities, regions, and counties should formulate plans for strengthening leadership, allocating cadres, training counselors, and developing organizational work according to their own circumstances.
    In schools that have already built teams, the frequent development work should be strengthened on the basis of carrying out activities and conducting education. The Young Pioneers organization is a broad-based educational organization for children. Whether the team organization is sound or not mainly depends on how the education is conducted. Therefore, it is wrong to stipulate excessive entry requirements and complicated procedures when developing team members.
    The Young Pioneers is the reserve force of the Youth League. The Youth League must help the team organization carry out the Youth League's education for team members and absorb outstanding team members who meet the conditions for joining the League. The team organization should also carry out educational activities related to the Youth League and do a good job in introducing outstanding team members to join the League. But it should also be pointed out that not all team members can be absorbed into the League.
    The Young Pioneers is an organization with age restrictions. For team members over 15 years old, the team's activities can no longer meet their requirements, and it is very natural for them to leave the team. However, because over-age team members have long been accustomed to staying in the team, they have many concerns about leaving the team. Therefore, education should be carried out well, and the reasons should be explained clearly. We must try our best to make them leave the team consciously and voluntarily, and we must never adopt simple and rigid methods. If individual team members are still unwilling to leave the team after education, they can temporarily stay in the team and must not be forced to leave the team. Youth League committees at all levels must seriously lead this work, and they can first conduct key experiments and gradually deal with it after gaining experience.
    (IV)
    In order to better cultivate and educate the younger generation of children, Youth League committees at all levels should strengthen the leadership of children's work.
    First, train counselors.
    Building an excellent team of counselors is the main key to doing a good job in the Young Pioneers. The Youth League organization should regard the selection, employment, cultivation, and training of counselors for the Young Pioneers as one of the regular and important tasks.
    At present, there are 160,000 counselors in the country. Most of them are active and enthusiastic, and many have achieved remarkable results in their work. However, some brigades and squadrons of the Young Pioneers do not have counselors, and a few counselors are very incompetent. For these team organizations, it is necessary to select and employ excellent teachers or Youth League members who are ideologically progressive, upright, and love children as counselors.
    There are achievements in the work of cultivating and training counselors in various places. However, since China's Young Pioneers' work is still in its initial stage, the frequent transfer of counselors and the large number of new counselors make it very important to further strengthen and improve the cultivation and training of counselors and regular leadership: (1) Use vacations to hold lectures and training courses for counselors. As far as possible, each general counselor can be rotated once a year. The content of the training should be different according to different objects. In general, in addition to implementing the work instructions of the superiors and teaching the team's business knowledge, we should mainly summarize the work in this area and introduce some advanced experiences to improve the work on the original basis. Where possible, we should also organize special reports on the political situation, education policies, and children's education for counselors, as well as visits and internships, to improve the political and business level of counselors. (2) Strengthen regular leadership over counselors. In the past, some city Youth League committees adopted counselor meetings once a week or every two weeks to arrange and check work, introduce experiences, organize observation activities, and hold special reports and discussions of documents in districts. This kind of flexible and diverse content and methods based on practical work are more suitable for the needs of counselors and are also effective methods for cultivating counselors. In rural areas, we can appropriately use the opportunity of the administrative meeting of teachers to carry out work; when necessary, the Youth League county committee can convene meetings of active counselors in each district and pass them on to other counselors. The Youth League organization should also regularly care about and help counselors in their studies, and should absorb counselors to participate in the report meetings and cultural and entertainment activities held by the Youth League committee; excellent counselors should be commended.
    In addition, in order to enable future teachers to be familiar with the Young Pioneers work, the Ministry of Education has added a chapter "Collective Organizations of Elementary School Students" to the "Education" textbook in the normal schools. It is hoped that the Youth League committees in various places will give the normal schools necessary assistance when teaching this chapter.
    In order to better help counselors study, the Central Committee of the Youth League is preparing to start a counselor publication in 1954.
    Second, run children's newspapers and periodicals well, and use children's newspapers and periodicals well to educate children.
    Children's newspapers and periodicals and children's books are important tools for cultivating and educating the new generation. At present, the children's newspapers and periodicals run by the Central Committee of the Youth League and the Youth League committees in various places have millions of readers. They occupy an extremely important position in cultivating children's communist ideological qualities, enriching children's knowledge, and helping children grow up healthily. Therefore, we must better strengthen the leadership of children's newspapers and periodicals and improve and improve the quality of children's newspapers and periodicals.
    Children's newspapers and periodicals should help children learn various basic knowledge, and often bring children all kinds of fresh and interesting knowledge suitable for their level, and actively guide them to pursue knowledge.
    Children's newspapers and periodicals should be good at educating and cultivating children's communist ideological qualities through vivid and concrete facts and excellent examples that are easy for children to accept and understand. Let the facts speak more and make less empty talk.
    Children's newspapers and periodicals should go deeper into reality and contact with children better, so that they can often reflect and guide children's learning and life, and guide the activities of the Young Pioneers.
    The language of children's newspapers and periodicals should be as simple and clear as possible, and the form should be as lively and beautiful as possible.
    At present, children's cultural famine is very serious. Many children rent and read monster, superstitious, and yellow books at book stalls, which greatly affects children's ideological qualities and learning discipline. In addition to running children's newspapers and periodicals well, the Youth League organizations should also strengthen contact with various relevant departments such as literature and art and science, and publishing agencies, promote and help writers, artists, and scientists create more and better children's literary and artistic and scientific works for children, and promote and help publishing agencies publish more and better children's books for children.
    In order to make good children's newspapers and periodicals and children's books truly become children's good teachers and helpful friends, the Youth League organizations and counselors should also do a good job in guiding children's reading. Introduce good books to children; organize the supply and circulation of books and newspapers, so that more children can read more good books; and guide them to better read books and newspapers. For bad books, they should be criticized and exposed, and for those that promote reactionary ideas, they should be suggested to the relevant government departments for prohibition.
    Third, in coordination with relevant departments, gradually establish children's extracurricular education institutions and carry out children's summer activities.
    Children's extracurricular education institutions, such as children's palaces, children's homes, children's theater troupes, children's libraries, and children's editorial departments of radio stations, as well as the various activities they hold, play a good role in helping schools carry out spare-time science, art, sports, and cultural and entertainment activities. However, there are still too few such institutions, and some have not been fully utilized. Therefore, in the future, with the development of national economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings, the Youth League should assist the government in a planned way to gradually build some extracurricular activity places for children, and unite with relevant departments to make full use of the existing equipment and widely carry out various activities to enrich children's spare-time cultural life.
    Summer and vacation activities are of great significance for increasing children's health, opening up children's horizons, and preparing for the new semester's learning life in terms of physical and intellectual knowledge. Cultural and rest activities for children, such as travel, visits, marches, camping, bonfire parties, evening parties, reading literary books, listening to the radio..., should be carried out in a more planned and organized manner under the existing possible conditions. In towns and other places where children are more concentrated, children's summer paradises can be held using the school's premises. Summer camps in the city and suburbs can be held in key cities and scenic spots with conditions. Attention should be paid to making summer and vacation activities more suitable for children's interests and requirements, and the life should not be too tense, so that children can get reasonable rest and a rich and meaningful life during the holidays.
    Fourth, strengthen the work of teachers and assist the Party in running schools well.
    Teachers play a decisive role in the cause of cultivating and educating children. At present, young teachers account for a considerable number in middle and primary schools, and many of them are Youth League members. They are a new force in education. Youth League committees at all levels should strengthen the work of teachers, improve and develop the Youth League organizations of teachers, strengthen the political and ideological work of Youth League members and young teachers, carry out the education of the general line, so that they understand the significance of their work, constantly improve their political and business levels, actively publicize new educational ideas and viewpoints, correctly implement and implement the Party's educational policies, and unite the vast number of teachers to jointly do a good job in teaching. At present, we should also assist the Party and the government in doing a good job in the rectification and improvement of primary schools and holding representative meetings of primary school teachers.
    Strengthening the work among young teachers is an important task of the Youth League in schools. Youth League committees in various places should pay attention to this work and conduct research and summarization.
    Fifth, allocate and train cadres and improve leadership methods.
    Leading children's work is a glorious task entrusted to the Youth League by the Party. Youth League committees at all levels must further strengthen the leadership of children's work and conduct regular discussions. Research on children's work. The allocation of cadres for children's work should be strengthened to improve the level of cadres. Youth League committees at the provincial and municipal levels should establish children's work departments and allocate full-time ministers or deputy ministers. Youth League committees at the regional and county levels should have someone in charge of school and children's work. In the allocation of cadres, attention should be paid to having a certain level of political culture and working ability, so that they can lead the work of the teacher Youth League and counselors. Youth League committees above the provincial and municipal levels should also take certain measures to train cadres for children's work and pay attention to giving them regular training and assistance through inspection and summary of work.
    Youth League committees at all levels The children's work department should better connect with reality, connect with the masses, grasp the key points, summarize specific experiences; strengthen work inspections, be good at using advanced experiences to promote work progress. At the same time, we should strengthen contact with relevant parties, closely cooperate with the work of all parties, create various favorable conditions for correctly cultivating children, and fight against phenomena that harm children and hinder children's normal development and growth. In addition, Youth League committees at all levels should also hold some children's mass cultural activities under possible conditions, such as children's creation exhibitions, literary and artistic performances, sports performances, and sports competitions..., to guide the Young Pioneers' organizations at all levels to better carry out activities.
    Finally, we should strengthen our learning well. Children's work is the work of cultivating new people. We not only lack experience in this area, but also lack the necessary political theory and business level. Only by studying well in our work, studying the theory of Marxism-Leninism, studying the Party's general line and education policy, and studying the advanced Soviet educational theory and the theory and experience of the Young Pioneers' work, can we do a good job in the work of cultivating and educating the new generation entrusted to us by the Party and the people.
    Comrades: Our task is very glorious and very arduous. We have gained initial experience and have a good start. Let us work harder, under the beacon of the general line and general task of the country's transition period, under the kind care and leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and push the work of children further forward!

    （一）
    四年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我国人民进行了抗美援朝运动、社会民主改革运动以及国民经济的恢复和发展工作，在政治经济文化等方面获得了伟大的胜利和成就，为少年儿童一代的幸福生活和美好前途奠定了坚实的基础。党和政府对少年儿童一代给予了深切的关怀，扩充和增设了许多中、小学校。目前，全国小学生比解放前最高数增加了一倍多，中学生增加了百分之五十以上。教师们经过历次爱国群众运动和思想改造，普遍提高了政治水平，教学上也有了进步。许多文化机关和娱乐场所已逐渐增设了儿童部门，如儿童图书馆、阅览室、体育场、游泳池、公园以及少年儿童剧团、广播电台的少年儿童节目等，这就使得儿童教育工作获得了更好的条件。
    一九四九年党委托青年团建立了中国少年儿童队（现已改名为中国少年先锋队），以团结教育广大少年儿童。一九五○年四月，青年团中央召开了第一次全国少年儿童工作干部大会，确定了队的工作方针和建队步骤。四年来由于各级团委和辅导员、教师们的共同努力以及各方面的关怀支持，少年先锋队的工作是有一定成绩的。我们已经有了七百万少年先锋队员和一支有十六万少年先锋队辅导员的队伍。少年先锋队配合着学校教育，开展了各种适合儿童年龄特点的有益的活动。在抗美援朝运动中，各地少年儿童与志愿军、解放军通信、联欢，想各种办法捐献飞机大炮，慰劳属烈军属，一九五二年春节全国八十三万少年儿童参加了“春节慰劳烈属军属一件事运动”，博得了全国烈军属和广大群众异口同声的称赞，说他们是“毛主席教养的好儿女”。为了响应毛主席“好好学习”的号召，许多队的组织通过参观、访问工厂和农村，与英雄、模范、作家、科学家会见，以及举行有一定主题的队会，如“四十五分钟的价值”、“算术多么重要”、“我们向卓娅学习些什么”等，启发了儿童对学习的兴趣和自觉性，在培养儿童的自觉纪律和提高学习成绩上都起了积极作用。有些地方还开展了各种课外研究小组的活动，制作各种标本、模型、图表，发挥了儿童的创造性。北京、上海、南京等地都举行过全市性的少年科学家集会，在上海的一次集会中就展览了七百五十件儿童自己创作的科学仪器、模型和标本。在各种活动中，儿童们新的思想品质也逐渐成长起来，爱护公物、拾金不昧、扶老携幼、帮助父母劳动等优良行为是很普遍的。学校里刻划桌椅和打碎玻璃等现象大为减少，许多儿童看见公共自来水管漏水，就设法堵塞或跑到派出所去报告，农村儿童也自觉地不走小道，以免践踏庄稼。许多群众都说：“戴了红领巾，孩子就变好了。”
    我们为少年儿童创办了全国性的队报——“中国少年报”和“中学生”、“新少年报”、“好孩子”、“红领巾”等儿童报刊。现在全国共有儿童报纸三种，刊物八种。“中国少年报”已经销行百余万份，其他几种报刊发行数量共有七十余万份。它们受到少年儿童的热烈欢迎，成为教育少年儿童的有力工具。
    每年六一国际儿童节和假期里，各地青年团组织积极地推动有关部门为少年儿童举办了庆祝节日的活动和夏令营、暑期乐园等，在少数有条件的城市如北京、上海、广州等地已开始建立了少年宫、少年之家这样的儿童校外教育机关。这就丰富了少年儿童的课余文化生活，增进了他们的知识和健康，使他们深深感到祖国的关怀。
    总的说来，四年来我们建立了少年先锋队的组织，摸索和创造了一些适合我国社会条件和儿童年龄特点的工作经验，帮助学校教育了儿童。少年先锋队已成为广大少年儿童所热爱的组织，并受到学校、家庭、社会各方面的赞许，证明了少年先锋队是学校实施新教育不可缺少的一个组成部分。这就为今后工作打下了良好的基础。
    但是，我们的工作还存在着不少的缺点和问题。由于少年先锋队的工作处在初创时期，缺乏经验，又由于许多团委过去忙于中心工作，对少年先锋队工作缺乏应有的重视和领导，对培养训练辅导员的工作做得不够，因而，许多干部和辅导员对于队的性质、任务以及儿童教育的正确观点和方法还缺乏明确的认识，队的活动还存在着枯燥、贫乏、成人化的偏向，还不善于根据儿童的年龄特点和配合学校教育进行工作。一些错误的教育观点和方法也未得到及时而有力的纠正。我们必须巩固已得的成绩，克服现存的缺点，进一步加强领导，才能把少年儿童工作做得更好。
    （二）
    我们的国家已进入新的历史时期，全国人民正在党和毛主席的领导下，为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造而斗争，以便把我国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家。儿童是国家的未来，他们将接替我们的事业，把社会主义、共产主义的旗帜撑持到最终的胜利。因此，爱护儿童，教育儿童是具有巨大的国家意义的任务，是新中国人民应有的美德和共同的责任。
    社会主义的社会制度和高度的生产水平要求它的建设者应是智德体美全面发展的新人。他们应该是集体主义者，为全人类和我国人民的幸福而献身的战士，而不是眼光渺小和庸俗的利己主义者；是热爱劳动、富于创造性的人，而不是懒惰保守、唯唯诺诺的人；是具有高度文化科学知识的人，而不是空空洞洞、不学无术的人；是生气蓬勃、坚韧强健的人，而不是呆板孱弱、意志消沉的人。因此，以共产主义精神教育少年儿童，培养他们成为爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物、健壮、活泼、勇敢、诚实的新中国的优秀儿女，就是少年儿童工作的基本任务。而这一任务在今天是更加重大了。
    培养教育新的一代，学校负有主要责任。少年先锋队在这一事业中起着重要的作用。列宁曾经说：“儿童的组织——这是教育共产主义者的好办法。”因为，儿童在自己的组织里，选举自己的领导人，共同组织各种有益的活动，使他们从小就习惯于把自己的目的和行动与集体的目的和行动一致起来，习惯于经常去关心集体的利益。而且，少年先锋队又为儿童提出了共同奋斗的目标——为建设祖国的事业，为实现毛主席的伟大理想而奋斗，这就可以使他们逐渐地学会把一切行动服从于这个目标，从而养成对学习、工作、生活的自觉态度，锻炼自己成为具有清晰目标和坚强意志的人。事实也正是这样，四年来少年先锋队的工作不仅是培养了儿童的爱国主义思想，开扩了儿童的眼界，丰富了儿童的知识，而且在启发和培养儿童的主动性、积极性、创造性和集体主义精神方面，给予了学校很大的帮助。因此，少年先锋队是学校教育不可缺少的一个组成部分。学校要关心和指导少年先锋队的工作。同时，少年先锋队在进行工作时，也必须明确学校是向儿童进行教育的主要阵地，少年先锋队的工作必须服从学校教育的任务，根据学校教导工作的意图和儿童的实际情况组织各种适合儿童兴趣和要求的活动，更好地帮助儿童接受学校教育，完成学习任务。脱离开学校教育的任务，不从儿童的实际情况出发，为活动而活动是不对的；不了解少年先锋队是儿童自己的组织，采用行政命令的方法领导队的活动，在队的活动中重复和延长正课，代替行政和教师的工作等，也是不对的。
    为了正确地培养、教育儿童，少年先锋队的工作内容和方法方式还应当符合儿童身心发展的要求，应当符合儿童的年龄特点。第一、儿童正在成长发育时期，各方面都不成熟，需要长时期的培养教育，才能逐渐趋于定型。因此，这就要求少年儿童工作者处处以身作则，以自己的模范行为去影响儿童、教导儿童。而且要多从正面积极地进行启发、说服、示范和提出一定的实践要求……，反复细致地、耐心地进行教育。既不应采用粗暴、急躁的方式，也不可提出他们不宜担负的任务与要求。过去，有的学校和少年先锋队组织在儿童中进行思想检查，搞“小三反”，开批评斗争会，讽刺打击犯错误或有缺点的儿童；有的在儿童中评选模范，以刺激竞赛的方法急躁地要求儿童进步，或实行强制性的学习互助，要儿童“包教保学”；有的单纯地使用儿童，主观地要求少年先锋队员事事带头起保证作用，使儿童负担过多过重的政治、生产任务。这些不从教育出发的错误作法，不仅不能收到效果，而且对于儿童的正常发展，有极大的害处。第二、儿童缺乏基本的知识，在进行教育时必须要从儿童的知识水平和理解能力出发，要多采用生动具体的事实去讲解问题，使他们能从自己所直接感受到的具体事例和形象来逐步地提高认识，不要一般化地空谈许多抽象的大道理，对于不同年龄的儿童还要有不同程度的内容和不同的要求。在活动形式上必须多种多样，富有兴趣，不要老一套。目前在我们的工作中存在着的缺点，一种是把儿童当作成人看待，如给儿童作长达两三小时的冗长抽象的大报告、要儿童讨论“反对自由主义”“论共产党员的修养”“农业生产的十大政策”等为他们所难于理解的问题，以及活动内容过于庞杂，时间过长，使儿童负担过重，难于接受；另一种是内容贫乏，方式简单，不能给儿童以新的东西，不能满足儿童体力和智力发展上的要求。这些缺点都需要改进。第三、少年儿童必须全面地发展、成长，他们的兴趣和要求也是多方面的，因此，对儿童的教育和培养也应该是多方面的。过去有的学校和少年先锋队组织，在帮助儿童搞好学习时，忽视了对儿童进行爱国主义政治思想教育，以至于像中苏友好月、朝鲜停战和鞍钢建设等这样重大的事情，都没有对儿童进行必要的教育，这样怎能培养出爱祖国和真正有知识的人呢？有的又忽略了开展文娱体育活动，以致儿童的课余生活异常贫乏枯燥，也往往因此影响了儿童的课堂学习。应该了解，智德体美各个方面是不能偏废的，只有全面的培养，丰富儿童的生活，才能使他们的每一个方面都得到充分的发展，而成为新型的人。第四、少年先锋队的活动应该建立在儿童的主动性和创造性的基础上。我们应当信任儿童、尊重儿童、引导和帮助他们自己去进行活动，用自己的力量把事情办成功。有的人不信任儿童的力量，在组织儿童活动时，从布置会场、请人讲演、拟主席的讲演稿等，都加以包办代替。更有一些人采取消极限制、约束儿童的作法，要儿童“斯文规矩”、“老实听话”、“走路不准跳，看戏不准笑”，显然，这样是不可能把儿童培养成为主动积极，勇敢活泼和有自尊自信的人的。
    那么，少年先锋队应该怎样根据少年儿童的年龄特点，配合学校，对儿童进行教育呢？
    第一、少年先锋队应该教育和帮助儿童好好学习，遵守纪律，为争取优良的学习成绩，获取丰富的知识而斗争。少年先锋队组织可以通过参观、访问、与英雄模范人物见面、讲故事、看电影、举行有一定主题的队会等多种多样的活动，以启发儿童的学习兴趣和求知欲望，明确学习各门功课的意义，培养儿童的学习自觉性和责任感，教育儿童上课要好好听讲，认真完成作业，有坚持性和克服困难的精神。少年先锋队组织还可以提倡学科集会，组织各种研究小组，制作模型、标本、机器和图表，观察和记录自然现象，培植花木，饲养小动物等，以扩大和加深课堂知识和培养儿童对科学的兴趣。书是知识的源泉，少年先锋队组织要宣传“书”的作用，给儿童介绍书籍；举行读书会、故事会、诗歌朗诵、和作家见面等活动，以指导儿童读书，培养儿童有经常读书的要求，从而使他们获得丰富的知识。
    第二、少年先锋队应该在对儿童进行爱国主义政治思想教育和培养儿童的道德品质方面帮助学校和教师。少年先锋队应经常通过各种生动形象的活动，帮助儿童了解祖国的历史，了解祖国伟大的建设事业和社会主义前途，了解苏联和各人民民主国家的成就，了解各族人民为和平民主而进行的斗争，以培养儿童的爱国主义和国际主义思想，并鼓舞儿童为了建设社会主义的祖国，为了人类美好的将来而更好地学习、工作和生活。
    少年先锋队应该帮助儿童逐渐熟悉领袖的生平事迹，以领袖为人民的幸福、为共产主义事业而进行的英勇斗争的范例教育年轻的一代；应该以英雄模范人物、优秀的科学家、文学家……的故事、传记来教育儿童，使儿童向他们学习，应该重视组织革命纪念日的儿童活动，帮助儿童逐渐熟悉革命传统和党的事业；应该通过各种活动和具体事例帮助儿童熟悉并热爱青年团，准备着参加青年团；应该在各种活动和儿童日常的学习、工作和生活中，注意培养儿童对待同志、对待劳动、对待公共利益的正确的态度，以及诚实、勇敢、活泼、进取的精神。
    第三、少年先锋队组织要加强少年儿童的劳动教育。劳动在我国是荣誉的事业，因为社会主义是要靠亿万人的劳动来建设的。我们应该教育儿童热爱劳动，准备参加工农业生产劳动，尊重劳动人民，珍惜劳动成果，并培养他们有经常从事体力劳动的习惯。在不妨碍学习和健康的条件下，应该适当地组织一些儿童力所能及的、有益的社会工作和公共劳动，如慰劳烈属军属、培植校园、整理修补图书、为学校制作教具、帮助农林部门植树护林……等。还可以提倡城乡儿童适当的联系，互相服务，以及馈赠一些本地出产的、自己制作的礼物。应该教育队员和儿童，自己生活上的事务自己动手，在家里要帮助家务。这些适当的社会工作对于增进儿童的知识和能力，培养儿童集体主义的思想感情和对劳动的热爱，都有重大的教育意义。
    第四、少年先锋队组织应该协助学校多方面开展儿童的体育活动，如体操、滑冰、游泳、爬山、划船，组织行军、旅行、军事体育游戏和比赛，举办各种球类和棋类的比赛、运动会和体育表演等。并要提倡各种适合儿童的课余游戏，如跳绳、踢毽子、踢皮球、霸王鞭等，以锻炼儿童健壮、活泼、勇敢、坚毅的体魄和意志，还要教育儿童遵守作息制度，养成卫生习惯。
    第五、少年先锋队组织应该注意培养儿童对文艺的兴趣，发展儿童在艺术方面的才能。文艺活动在启发智慧、陶冶性格方面起着重要作用，应该广泛地开展儿童的文化娱乐活动，如合唱、集体舞蹈、诗歌朗诵、举办文艺晚会等。也应该在可能条件下按不同的兴趣，为儿童组织各种音乐、舞蹈、绘画、美工、刺绣等小组。并且应该在儿童的各种活动和日常生活中培养儿童的爱美观点。
    总之，我们必须按照智德体美全面发展的方针，根据少年儿童的年龄特点，配合学校教育，开展少年先锋队的活动，正确地培养教育少年儿童。经常地宣传和推广合乎共产主义教育思想的好经验，用批评和自我批评的方法去克服那些不正确的和封建的、资产阶级的教育观点和方法，不断提高我们的工作水平，为培养社会主义的新人而努力！
    （三）
    少年先锋队组织已经发展到七百万人，它已经是具有全国规模的、少年儿童所热爱的组织了。为了更好地团结教育广大少年儿童，必须进一步做好少年先锋队的组织发展工作。
    几年来，少年先锋队组织的发展工作是有成绩的，但同时也存在着许多问题。主要的是有些地方团委对于建队工作缺乏应有的领导，因而，有些队的组织是自流地建立起来的，有的还没有辅导员，有的虽有辅导员，但由于没有领导，不知道如何工作。同时在建队学校里普遍对于经常发展队员的工作不够重视，许多地方还存在入队条件过高、手续过繁的现象，妨碍了少年先锋队团结教育广大少年儿童的作用。
    在少年先锋队组织的发展问题上，一方面应该看到少年先锋队是广泛性的少年儿童组织，广大的少年儿童正迫切地希望入队，因此必须有计划地发展队的组织，逐步地把广大少年儿童吸收到队的组织里来。另一方面，建队既是为了更好地教育少年儿童，因此就必须要有适当的人来领导，这样才能使儿童从申请入队直至入队后，都能受到教育。没有适当的人领导，就会产生只是形式上建了队，而达不到教育少年儿童的目的。根据目前各地的主要情况和我们已有的经验教训，今后少年先锋队的组织发展方针应该是：采取积极态度，分别不同情况，有领导、有计划地逐步发展队的组织。
      建队必须具备两个条件：一是团委要有人负责，二是建队学校要有适当的人选可以担任总辅导员和中队辅导员。因此，在大、中城市团委有人负责的地方，主要是要积极培养辅导员，有计划有步骤地开展建队工作。在农村、没有人负责少年儿童工作的团县委应当确定专人来负责这一工作；过去发展不多的，应当摸清学校情况，在有条件的学校里逐步建队；过去已经发展很多，而长期没有领导的，则首先应该加强对已建队学校的领导，训练辅导员，开展队的活动，然后，再逐步地在其他有条件的学校建队。对过去自发地建立起来的队组织，应积极地和有关方面商议，选聘辅导员，加以领导，不能采取“整队”和单纯解散的办法。青年团的各省、市、地、县委都应该根据自己的情况，订出有关加强领导、配备干部、训练辅导员以及发展组织工作的计划。
    在已经建队的学校里，应在开展活动、进行教育的基础上，加强经常发展工作。少年先锋队组织是一个广泛性的少年儿童的教育组织。队的组织的健全与否主要在于教育的情况如何。因此在发展队员时，规定过高的入队条件和繁复的手续是不对的。
    少年先锋队是青年团的后备军。青年团必须帮助队的组织向队员进行团的教育，并吸收具备入团条件的优秀队员入团。队的组织也应该开展有关团的教育活动，做好介绍优秀队员入团的工作。但同时也应指出：并不是所有队员都能被吸收入团的。
    少年先锋队是一个有年龄限制的组织，超过十五周岁的队员，队的活动已不能满足他们的要求，他们离队本是很自然的事情。但由于超龄队员长期地习惯于留在队内，对于离队有许多顾虑。因此，应很好地进行教育，讲清道理，尽量做到使他们自觉自愿地离队，绝不能采取简单生硬的方式。如有个别队员在经过教育之后还不愿离队的，可暂时留在队内，不得强迫离队。各级团委必须认真地领导这一工作，可先在重点试验，取得经验后再逐步处理。
    （四）
    为了更好地培养教育少年儿童一代，各级团委应该加强少年儿童工作的领导。
    第一、培养训练辅导员。
    建立一支优秀的辅导员队伍，是做好少年先锋队工作的主要关键。青年团组织应该把为少年先锋队选聘、培养和训练辅导员作为经常的重要工作之
  一。
    目前全国有十六万辅导员，他们大都是积极热情的，有许多人在工作中取得了显著的成绩。但是还有一些少年先锋队的大队和中队没有辅导员，还有少数的辅导员很不称职，必须为这些队的组织很好地选聘思想进步、作风正派、热爱儿童的优秀教师或团员担任辅导员。
      各地在培养训练辅导员的工作上，是有成绩的。但是，由于我国少年先锋队工作还在初创时期，目前辅导员调动频繁，新辅导员数量很大，因此进一步加强和改进对辅导员的培养训练和经常领导是很重要的：（一）利用假期举办辅导员的讲习会和训练班。尽可能做到每个总辅导员每年能轮训一次。训练内容应根据不同对象有所区别，一般除贯彻上级的工作指示，讲授队的业务知识外，主要应总结本地区的工作，并介绍一些先进经验，使工作在原有的基础上提高一步。在可能的条件下，还应当为辅导员组织政治形势、教育政策和有关儿童教育的专题报告，以及参观、实习等内容，以提高辅导员的政治和业务水平。（二）要加强对辅导员的经常领导。过去有些城市团委采用每周或两周一次的辅导员会议，以区为单位布置和检查工作，介绍经验，组织观摩活动，举行专题报告和讨论文件等。这种从实际工作出发的、比较灵活的、多种多样的内容和方式，比较适合辅导员的需要，也是培养辅导员的有效办法。在农村，可适当利用行政召开教师会议的机会进行工作；必要时团县委可以召集各区辅导员积极分子会议，通过他们传授给其他辅导员。团的组织还应该经常关心和帮助辅导员的学习，应该吸收辅导员参加团委举办的报告会和文化娱乐活动；对于优秀的辅导员，应该加以表扬。
    此外，为了使未来的教师能熟悉少年先锋队工作，教育部已经在师范学校课本“教育学”中增加了“小学生的集体组织”一章，希望各地团委在讲授这章课程时给师范学校以必要的帮助。
    青年团中央为了更好地帮助辅导员学习，准备在一九五四年创办一个辅导员刊物。
    第二、办好少年儿童的报纸刊物，并很好运用儿童的报刊读物教育儿童。
    儿童报刊、儿童读物是培养教育新一代的重要工具。目前团中央和各地团委所办的儿童报刊，拥有数百万读者。它们在培养儿童的共产主义思想品质，丰富儿童的知识，帮助儿童健康地成长等方面，占有极为重要的地位。因此，必须更好地加强对儿童报刊的领导，改进和提高儿童报刊的质量。
    儿童报刊应该帮助儿童学习各种基础知识，经常带给儿童以适合他们水平的、多方面的、新鲜有趣的知识，并积极地引导他们去追求知识。
    儿童报刊要善于通过儿童所易于接受和理解的、生动具体的事实和优秀的范例，去教育和培养儿童的共产主义思想品质。多让事实说话，少发空论。
    儿童报刊要更好地深入实际，联系儿童，以便能够经常反映和指导儿童的学习和生活，指导少年先锋队的活动。
    儿童报刊文字要力求浅近明白，形式要力求活泼美观。
    目前儿童的文化饥荒非常严重，不少儿童在书摊上租阅神怪、迷信、黄色的书籍，大大影响了儿童的思想品质与学习纪律。青年团组织除了要办好儿童报刊以外，还应当与文学艺术和科学等各有关部门以及出版机关加强联系，推动和帮助作家、艺术家、科学家为儿童创作更多更好的儿童文艺和科学作品，推动和帮助出版机关为儿童出版更多更好的儿童读物。
    为了使好的儿童报刊、儿童读物真正成为儿童的良师益友，青年团组织和辅导员还要做好指导儿童阅读的工作。为儿童介绍好书；组织书报的供应和流通，使更多的儿童能够读到更多的好书；以及指导他们更好地阅读书报。对于坏书，要加以批评揭露，对于其中宣传反动思想的则应建议政府有关部门予以禁止。
    第三、配合有关部门，逐步建立儿童校外教育机关和开展儿童夏季活动。
    儿童的校外教育机关如少年宫、少年之家、少年儿童剧团、儿童图书馆、广播电台的少年儿童编辑部等，以及他们所举办的各种活动，在帮助学校开展课余的科学、艺术、体育、文娱活动等方面起着很好的作用。但是，这样的机关为数还是太少，有的也还没有充分被利用起来。因此今后随着国家经济建设和文化教育事业的发展，青年团应该协助政府有计划地逐步为儿童增建一些校外活动场所，并联合有关部门，充分利用现有的设备，广泛开展各种活动，丰富儿童的课余文化生活。
    夏季和假期活动对于增进儿童的健康，开豁儿童的眼界，为新学期的学习生活在身体和知识上作好准备，有着重要的意义。应该在现有的可能条件下，更加有计划、有组织地开展儿童的夏季和假期的文化休息活动，如举行旅行、参观、行军、露营、营火会、晚会，阅读文艺书籍，收听广播……等。在城镇等儿童较集中的地方，可以利用学校的场所，举办儿童暑期乐园。在大、中城市和风景区等有条件的地方可以重点举办城内和郊外的夏令营。应当注意使夏季和假期活动能够更适合儿童的兴趣和要求，生活不要过于紧张，使儿童在假期里得到合理的休息和丰富的、有意义的生活。
    第四、加强教师工作，协助党办好学校。
    教师在培养教育少年儿童的事业中起着决定性的作用。目前在中、小学中，青年教师占有相当数量，其中也有不少是团员，他们是教育工作中的新生力量。各级团委应该加强教师工作，健全和发展教师团的组织，加强对团员和青年教师的政治思想工作，进行总路线的教育，使他们懂得自己工作的意义，不断提高自己的政治业务水平，积极宣传新的教育思想和观点，正确地执行和贯彻党的教育政策，并团结广大教师共同搞好教学工作。目前，还应该协助党、政做好小学整顿改进工作和开好小学教师代表会议。
    加强青年教师中的工作，是团在学校中的一项重要任务，各地团委应重视这一工作，并加以研究总结。
    第五、配备训练干部，改进领导方法。
    领导少年儿童工作是党交给青年团的一个光荣任务，各级团委必须进一步加强对少年儿童工作的领导，定期讨论。研究少年儿童工作。应该加强少年儿童工作干部的配备，提高干部的水平。省、市一级团委要建立少年儿童工作部门，配备专职的部长或副部长。地、县团委应有专人管理学校和少年儿童工作。在干部配备上，应注意有一定的政治文化水平和工作能力，以便能够领导学校教师团和辅导员的工作。省市以上团委并应采取一定措施训练少年儿童工作干部，并注意通过检查和总结工作，给他们以经常的培养和帮助。
    各级团委少年儿童工作部门要更好地联系实际、联系群众，抓住重点，总结具体经验；加强工作检查，善于利用先进经验以推动工作前进。同时应该加强和有关方面的联系，密切配合各方面的工作，为正确地培养儿童创造各种有利的条件，并与残害儿童和妨碍儿童正常发育成长的现象作斗争。此外，各级团委还应该在可能的条件下举办一些儿童的群众文化活动，如全县、全市、甚至全国的儿童创作展览、文艺会演、体育表演、和体育比赛……等，以引导少年先锋队各级组织更好地开展活动。
      最后，应该很好地加强我们的学习。少年儿童工作是培植新人的工作，我们在这方面不仅是还缺乏经验，也缺少应有的政治理论和业务水平。只有很好地在工作中学习，学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习党的总路线和教育政策，学习苏联的先进的教育理论和少年先锋队工作的理论和经验，这样我们才有可能做好党和人民所交托的培养教育新一代的工作。
    同志们：我们的任务是很光荣的，也是很艰巨的，我们已取得了初步经验，有了一个良好的开端。让我们更好地努力，在国家过渡时期总路线总任务的灯塔照耀下，在共产党和毛主席的亲切关怀和领导下，把少年儿童工作更加推向前进！
