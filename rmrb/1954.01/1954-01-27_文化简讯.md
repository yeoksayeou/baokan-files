      Lhasa People's Hospital Actively Serves Tibetan People
    Lhasa People's Hospital in the Tibet region is actively safeguarding the health of the Tibetan people. In 1953, the hospital provided outpatient services to over 81,000 people, performed over 200 major and minor surgical treatments, and promptly extinguished epidemic infectious diseases such as diphtheria and pneumonia in the Lhasa urban area. It has achieved even more remarkable results in cataract surgeries, the most prevalent eye disease among the Tibetan people, and in carrying out maternal and child healthcare work. It also provided meticulous treatment to venereal disease patients among the Tibetan people. During the busy farming season, the People's Hospital sent medical teams to rural areas in Shannan District and along the western section of the Kangzang Highway to treat farmers and conduct disease prevention publicity. The hospital has established waiting rooms and 90 beds and has improved its work by adopting advanced Soviet experience. They frequently observe and learn from Tibetan doctors at the "Mentsekhang" (i.e., the Medical Administration Bureau) of the Tibetan local government, and the "Mentsekhang" sends young students to the hospital to study. Local Tibetan doctors have also been hired to work in the dermatology and venereology department. This year, the People's Hospital will continue to focus on treatment, vigorously train Tibetan doctors, and further publicize health knowledge to the Tibetan people.
      Multiple Ancient Sites Discovered in Gulang County, Gansu Province
    The cultural relics clearing team in the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway construction area discovered 22 ancient sites in Gulang and Yongdeng counties, Gansu Province. More than 200 cultural relics, including stone tools, bronze ware, ironware, red pottery, and painted pottery, were excavated from these sites. The most valuable for research are the stone weight and the round bronze *pinghu* unearthed at the Han Dynasty site in Chenjiahe Taizi, Gulang. The *pinghu* has handles on both sides and a capacity of about 19.6 *shi* liters. It is inscribed with thirteen small seal script characters: "Made by the Dasinong *Pinghu* in the 11th year of Jianwu, first month," making it a relic from the Eastern Han Dynasty more than 1,900 years ago. The stone weight is shaped like a steamed bun with a chiseled hole at the top and weighs 78.5 *shi* catties. The *pinghu* and the stone weight are both weights and measures tools. Such tools from the Han Dynasty have not been unearthed often, providing important physical evidence for studying the weights and measures system at that time. In addition, also unearthed at this Han Dynasty site were a stone mill with six carved rhombic tooth patterns, as well as production tools such as hoes, axes, plows, and iron shovels. These tools are of certain value for studying the development of productivity in the Han Dynasty. In a Neolithic site discovered in Heisongyi, Gulang, in addition to the discovery of coarse red pottery fragments, painted pottery fragments, and stone tools, five bag-shaped ash pits were found. Most special was the discovery of a red clay stove, with a round pit with a diameter of 15 cm in the middle, with broken pottery inlaid in the mouth, leaving traces of burning. On the periphery of the stove, there were remnants of four wooden pillars, the unearthed surface of which was equal to the stove.

      甘肃省古浪县境内发现多处古代遗址
    兰新铁路沿线工程地区文物清理组在甘肃省古浪及永登境内发现了二十二处古代遗址。从这些遗址中，挖掘出二百多件石器、铜器、铁器、红陶、彩陶等文物，其中最有研究价值的是在古浪陈家河台子汉代遗址中出土的石权和圆形铜制平斛。平斛两旁有柄，容量约合十九点六市升，上刻有“大司农平斛建武十一年正月造”十三个小篆铭文，是一千九百多年前东汉时代的遗物。石权成馒头形，顶部有镌孔，重七十八点五市斤。平斛和石权都是度量衡工具，汉代的这种工具出土的还不多，对研究当时度量衡制度提供了重要的实物证据。此外，在这个汉代遗址中出土的还有六轮刻凿菱形齿纹的石磨及镢、斧、犁、铁铣等生产工具，这些工具对研究汉代生产力的发展也有一定的价值。在古浪黑松驿发现的一处新石器时代遗址内，除发现粗红陶片、彩陶片和石器外，并发现了五个袋形灰坑，最特殊的是发现一处红胶泥的灶台，中间有一个直径十五公分的圆坑，口部镶嵌着破陶器，留有用火烧过的痕迹。灶台的外围，有四个木柱的残余部分，出土面和灶台相等。
