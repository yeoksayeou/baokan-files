　　New Year's Greetings to the Motherland
　　Wang Chengyuan
    The various colored banners awarded by superiors, and the various lanterns made by the soldiers themselves, reflected on the soldiers' faces, making them look even more radiant and energetic. A long row of tables was filled with all kinds of fruits and candies. This was the spacious club of the Sixth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and everyone was waiting for the grand feast on New Year's Eve.
    Amidst the laughter, Long Xingfu, a young soldier and first-class meritorious person, suddenly stood up and shouted, "Comrades, do you know where this candy comes from?"
    "From the Motherland, of course."
    "That goes without saying. I'm asking, what part of the Motherland?"
    "Who knows? The Motherland is so big."
    "But I know." Long Xingfu was getting excited, but then panicked, afraid of saying something wrong, so he looked again at the wrapper of the candy before saying, "This candy comes from Shanghai."
    A soldier immediately retorted, "Comrade, you've been looking for so long, but you're still wrong. The one I ate came from Shenyang."
    "You're not right either. This candy of mine comes from Tianjin."
    "…Do you know how good Guangdong is? It produces hundreds of kinds of fruits and trees, and it's just like the wheat season now. These oranges might be from Guangdong!" Long Xingfu became more and more excited. "Looking at all these things on the table, I feel like our Motherland is like a big family, and we are like in this family."
    "Alright! Alright! Let me read a letter from the big family!" With this voice, everyone looked at Deputy Company Commander Lü Daqin, who had attended the National Day observation ceremony in 1953.
    Lü Daqin took out a letter from Jin Mingyuan, a worker at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works, and read it aloud: "Comrade Daqin: Let me first tell you some good news: Not long after you left us, the seamless steel pipe factory fully started production, and a few days ago, our large rolling mill also started production." All the soldiers jumped up as if they had heard good news on the battlefield when they heard this.
    After Lü Daqin finished reading the letter, he continued, "Comrades, every new factory and mine in the Motherland is built by the hard work of our worker brothers, day and night, with their blood and sweat. They are much more hardworking than us. Last time I wrote a letter mentioning 'You are really working hard.' The worker brothers replied: 'It is glorious to build the Motherland, and a little hardship is nothing. Building the Motherland is like fighting on the front lines, there are difficulties, but you overcame the difficulties and won the battle; we must also learn from your spirit of brave fighting, overcome difficulties, and strive to win the battle on the construction front...'”
    Yang Shucheng, a young soldier sitting next to Lü Daqin, grabbed his arm before he could finish speaking, and said naively and happily, "Deputy Company Commander, we will guard the gate for the Motherland well, so that the people of the Motherland can build in peace at home. Don't you think it will be very quick to build a socialist society?"
    Lü Daqin's reading of the letter started a trend, and everyone competed to read the letters recently sent from the Motherland. Some of these letters came from the great Northwest of the Motherland, and the soldiers learned that a large-scale automated thermal power plant had been built there. Some came from remote villages in Sichuan Province, and the soldiers learned that the lives of the people there were better than before after the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was opened. They had seen all this in the newspapers, but seeing it directly from the letters from the local people felt particularly intimate.
    Lu Xianzhi, a soldier from Gongzi Township, Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, received a letter from home in the first month. The letter said how his family had joined the agricultural production cooperative and how they had reaped a bumper harvest, and last year alone they had received more than 7,000 catties of grain. He had wanted to read it several times but hadn't been able to compete for it. When the dishes were being served, he took advantage of the break and competed to say again, "Comrades, let me read it, and I'll show you a picture." It turned out to be a picture of his wife attending winter school in the agricultural production cooperative's club. She was wearing a brand new floral dress and sitting at a table learning to read, and there was a bright electric lamp hanging above the table.
    After Lu Xianzhi finished reading the letter, he said excitedly like a child, "In the old society, we worried about every meal. Now, one person can get a thousand catties of grain a year, and they have installed electric lights. Chairman Mao has formulated a general line for our country, to collectivize agriculture. If all the farmers in our country establish agricultural production cooperatives, how great that would be!"
    The sumptuous feast began, and every soldier's face was filled with a happy and joyful smile. How could they not feel happy and joyful with such a great and warm big family!

　　新年话祖国
　　王程远
    上级奖给的各色锦旗，战士亲手做成的各式灯笼，掩映着战士们的脸孔，使他们越发显得红光满面，精神焕发。一排长长的桌子上，摆着各色各样的水果和糖果。这是志愿军某部六连宽大的俱乐部，大家正在等待着元旦之夜的盛大会餐。
    在一片欢笑声中，年轻的战士、一等功臣龙兴福忽然站起来嚷着说：“同志们，大家知道这糖是从什么地方来的吗？”
    “从祖国呗。”
    “那还用说。我问的是祖国的什么地方。”
    “那谁能知道，祖国那么大。”
    “但是，我可知道。”龙兴福正说到劲上，一慌，又怕说错了，就重新在那块包糖的纸上瞅了一眼才说：“这糖是从上海来的呀。”
    一个战士马上反驳道：“同志，看了半天，你还是说错了，我吃这块是从沈阳来的。”
    “你也没说对。我这块糖却是从天津来的呀。”
    “……大家知道广东有多么好吗。出产好几百种果木，现在正和麦天一样，这些橘子说不定就是广东来的呢？”龙兴福越说越兴奋，“看看桌子上放的这些东西，我就觉得，我们祖国象个大家庭一样，我们就象在这个家里。”
    “得啦！得啦！让我念一封从大家庭来的信好吧！”随着这声音，大家都注视着参加过一九五三年国庆节观礼的吕大勤副连长。
    吕大勤拿出鞍山炼钢厂工人金明远写给他的一封信念道：“大勤同志：让我先告诉您个好消息：您离开我们这里不久，无缝钢管厂就全面开工生产了，前些日子，我们大型轧钢厂也开工生产了。”所有的战士们听到这里如同在作战时听到了捷报一样地跳跃起来。
    吕大勤把信念完了，接着说：“同志们，祖国每一个新的工厂和矿山，都是工人老大哥昼夜不停地工作，用血汗建设起来的。他们比我们可辛苦的多啦。上次去信我提了一句‘你们真是辛苦啦。’工人老大哥却回信说：‘为祖国建设是光荣的，辛苦点算不了什么。建设祖国也象你们在前线作战一样，是有困难的，可是，你们战胜了困难，把仗打胜了；我们也要学习你们勇敢战斗的精神，克服困难，争取在建设战线上也打胜仗……’。”
    坐在吕大勤旁边的小鬼杨书成，还没等他说完，就抓住他的胳臂，天真愉快地说：“副连长，我们好好地给祖国把守着大门，让祖国人民安安静静地在家里建设，你说，建设成社会主义社会不是很快吗？”
    吕大勤的读信引起了头，大家都争着要读读最近收到从祖国寄来的信。这些信有的来自祖国的大西北，战士们知道了那里已经建成了一个规模宏大的自动化火力发电厂。有些来自四川省偏僻的乡村，战士们知道了那里的人民在成渝铁路通车后，生活比以前过得更好了。所有这些，他们都在报纸上看到过，但是，直接从当地人民的来信中看到，就觉得分外亲切。
    家在江苏省江浦县公子乡的战士鲁先知，在头一个月就接到家里的一封信。信上说家中如何参加了农业生产合作社，如何得到了丰收，去年一年就分得了七千多斤粮食。他几次要读都没争上，直到向上端菜时，他乘着大家停了下来又争着说：“同志们，让我读一读吧，我还给大家个像片看。”原来这是一张他爱人在农业生产合作社的俱乐部里上冬学的像片，她穿了一身崭新的花衣裳，正坐在桌子旁边认字，桌子上面还挂着一盏明亮的电灯。
    鲁先知读完了信，兴奋地象个孩子一样地说：“在旧社会吃了这顿愁那顿，现在一个人，一年能分一千斤粮，还安了电灯，毛主席给咱们国家规定了总路线，要使农业集体化。要是咱们全国的农民都成立了农业生产合作社，那该是多么好啊。”
    丰盛的会餐开始了，每一个战士的脸上都浮现着愉快的幸福的笑，他们有这样伟大温暖的大家庭，怎么能不感到愉快和幸福呢！
