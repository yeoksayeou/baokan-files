　　Over 500 Primary and Secondary School Teachers in Shanghai Begin Part-time Further Education

　　The newly established Primary School Teachers' Part-time Further Education School and the Secondary School Teachers' Part-time Further Education College in Shanghai have commenced classes. The first group of teachers enrolled for further education totals over 590.

　　These two schools have established ten specialized and professional courses according to the main courses in current primary and secondary schools. Enrolled teachers study in the specialized or professional course that is the same as the course they teach. The period of study is one year. Most of the students in this session of the Secondary School Teachers' Part-time Further Education College are junior high school teachers. After one year of study, they are required to master one high school course and have complete knowledge of this course. For example, students in the geography class originally had the ability to teach junior high school geography (physical geography). Now they are enrolled to study high school geography (economic geography) to enable them to obtain comprehensive geographical knowledge and improve their teaching level.

　　In order to meet the needs of the development of secondary education, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Education Bureau has also entrusted the East China Fast-Track Experimental School to train more than 300 junior high school teachers.

　　Great Development in Primary Education in Dongxiang Autonomous Region

　　Primary education in the Dongxiang Autonomous Region of Gansu Province has developed greatly. In 1949, there were only nine primary schools with more than 400 students in the entire region. Now there are 28 primary schools with more than 2,100 students, of which Dongxiang students account for more than 56% of all enrolled children. People of all ethnic groups, including Dongxiang, Hui, and Han, can now send their children to schools not far from their homes. Last year, 16 graduates from Linxia and Yinchuan Normal Schools were assigned to work in the Dongxiang Autonomous Region, and all primary school teachers in the region have been fully staffed according to the established number of personnel. The people's government at higher levels attaches great importance to primary education in the Dongxiang Autonomous Region. The minority education funds allocated last year nearly tripled those of 1952. General primary schools now have relatively spacious classrooms, comfortable dormitories, and some sports equipment. Some primary schools also have harmoniums, phonographs, and projectors donated by the people's government at higher levels. Most of the primary school graduates from the autonomous region last year and this year have been admitted to the Dongxiang Autonomous Region Normal School.

　　Fushun Petroleum School Opens

　　The Fushun Petroleum School officially started classes in early December last year. This is a newly built school in Northeast China by the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government to meet the needs of the rapidly developing petroleum industry, training middle-level technical personnel for the petroleum industry. Its predecessor was the Dalian Petroleum Industry School. The Dalian Petroleum Industry School was a school developed from a training class. Teachers and students attended classes in several extremely scattered and narrow houses in Dalian, without laboratories or instruments. The teachers made their own instruments or borrowed them from factories, and conducted experiments in the dining hall. Under these circumstances, the school trained more than 100 petroleum industrial construction personnel for the country and sent them to the petroleum industrial departments in Shanghai, the Northwest, and Northeast China.

　　The Fushun Petroleum School currently has three specialized departments: synthetic petroleum, natural petroleum, and petroleum machinery. The study period is three years. There are currently six classes, one of which is a preparatory class set up to provide cultural supplementary lessons for worker students who do not have junior high school education. There are currently more than 270 students, of which 40% are workers transferred from petroleum factories in Northeast China.

　　People's Sports Publishing House Established

　　The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, in order to adapt to the development of sports, and to systematically publish sports books, has established the People's Sports Publishing House. The publishing house is ready and will begin to publish sports books successively from New Year's Day in 1954. Since liberation, the people's sports activities have been increasingly developed, and some past sports books can no longer meet the needs of the masses. Therefore, publishing sports books has become an important task for carrying out sports activities.

　　In accordance with the instructions of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the editorial and publishing policy of the People's Sports Publishing House in 1954 is to publicize the scientific value and importance of sports in promoting people's health, to introduce the basic techniques and physiological hygiene knowledge of sports, and to extensively introduce the theories and experiences of Soviet sports.

    文化简讯
      上海市五百多中小学校教师开始业余进修
    上海市新创办的初等学校教师业余进修学校和中等学校教师业余进修学院已先后开学。第一期入学进修的教师共有五百九十多人。
    这两个学校按照当前中、小学中的主要课程分别设置了十个专科和专业课程班。入学的教师就在和他所教课程相同的专科或专业课程班中进修。进修期都是一年。中学教师业余进修学院这一期的学员大部分是初中教师，经过一年的学习，要求他们能掌握所进修的一种高中课程，并对这一课程具有完整的知识。像地理班的学员原已具有初中地理（自然地理）的讲授能力，现在入学进修高中地理（经济地理），使他们获得全面的地理知识，来提高教学水平。
    为了适应中学教育发展的需要，上海市人民政府教育局还委托华东速成实验学校培养三百多个初中师资。
      东乡自治区小学教育事业有很大发展
    甘肃省东乡自治区的小学教育事业已有很大发展。一九四九年全区只有九所小学，四百多名学生；现在全区已有二十八所小学，两千一百多名学生，其中东乡族学生占全部入学儿童的百分之五十六以上。东乡、回、汉等各族人民已经可以把自己的子弟，送到离家门不远的学校里上学了。去年从临夏和银川师范学校毕业的学生，有十六名被分配到东乡自治区工作，全区小学教师都已按编制人数配备齐全。上级人民政府对东乡自治区小学教育十分重视。去年拨发的少数民族教育事业费将近超过一九五二年的三倍。一般小学现在都有了比较宽敞的教室、舒适的宿舍以及一些体育运动设备等，有些小学还有上级人民政府赠送的风琴、留声机和幻灯机等。自治区去年和今年毕业的小学生绝大部分都已升入东乡自治区师范学校学习。
      抚顺石油学校开学
    抚顺石油学校已于去年十二月上旬正式开课。这是中央人民政府燃料工业部为适应迅速发展着的石油工业的需要，在东北新建的一所培养石油工业中等技术人材的学校。它的前身是大连石油工业学校。大连石油工业学校是从一个训练班发展起来的学校，师生们在大连几幢极分散和狭窄的房子里上课，没有试验室和仪器，教员们自己做或到工厂去借仪器，在饭厅里做试验。在这种情况下，该校为国家培养出一百多名石油工业建设人材，输送到上海、西北及东北各石油工业部门。
    抚顺石油学校现有人造石油、天然石油、石油机械三个专业科，学习时间为三年。现有六个班，其中有一班是为了给不足初中文化程度的工人学员补习文化而设的预备班。现共有学生二百七十多名，其中由东北各石油工厂调来的工人占百分之四十。
    人民体育出版社成立
    中央人民政府体育运动委员会为适应体育运动事业的发展，有计划地出版体育书籍，特成立人民体育出版社。该出版社已筹备就绪，自一九五四年元旦起即将陆续出版有关体育图书。解放以来，人民的体育运动日益开展，过去的一些体育书籍已远不能满足广大群众的要求，因此，出版体育书籍就成为开展体育运动的一个重要任务。
    人民体育出版社遵照中央人民政府体育运动委员会的指示，一九五四年的编辑出版方针为宣传体育运动对于增进人民健康的科学价值和重要意义，介绍体育运动的初级技术和生理卫生知识，大量介绍苏联体育运动的理论和经验。
