    Experiences of Two District Committees in Songjiang Province in Piloting Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Chen Wenzhi
    Last year, the First District of Huanan County and the Third District of Wuchang County in Songjiang Province piloted fifteen agricultural production cooperatives. Thanks to the strengthened leadership of the Communist Party committees in these two districts, all fifteen pilot agricultural production cooperatives achieved increased production, which was widely supported by the masses. The average wheat yield per hectare in the nine agricultural production cooperatives in Huanan First District was 1,200 jin, 200 jin higher than that of local mutual aid teams. The situation was similar in the six agricultural production cooperatives in Wuchang Third District. This increased the income of the peasants, and the newly established agricultural production cooperatives are expected to distribute more than 60 jin of grain per labor day. This achievement of the agricultural production cooperatives has promoted the development of the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement. For example, permanent mutual aid teams and seasonal mutual aid teams have increased compared with 1952, while temporary mutual aid teams have decreased compared with 1952. On the other hand, the district committees significantly improved their leadership capacity for agricultural production cooperatives during this pilot work. The district committees in these two districts have the following common characteristics in their leadership methods:

      First, they are able to diligently study the Party's policies on mutual aid and cooperation and learn from the work experience of other regions in mutual aid and cooperation. This is one of the fundamental conditions for the district committees to run agricultural production cooperatives well. The district committees were originally unfamiliar with the work of agricultural production cooperatives, but now that they have to do this work, and must do it well, they need to study. Both districts adopted this correct attitude. In their studies, they also adopted the method of learning, doing, and improving simultaneously. Before starting work, they first study relevant documents to clarify their thinking. If problems are discovered during the work, they are studied and resolved at any time. At the same time, the main responsible cadres regularly make special reports on various issues related to agricultural production cooperatives, mobilizing cadres to conduct discussions. This effectively improved everyone's ability to lead agricultural production cooperatives.

    Secondly, the district committees implemented collective leadership over agricultural production cooperatives, giving full play to collective wisdom and creativity. The specific method is: the district committees treat the pilot establishment of agricultural production cooperatives as an important task, and study and deploy it uniformly with other tasks. The district committees convene everyone for meetings at any time as needed to report on the situation, concentrate on research, and exchange experiences. In order to improve the effectiveness of the district committees' collective leadership, base-point cooperatives were established during the pilot work. The role of the base-point cooperatives is to take the first step, discover problems in a timely manner, and summarize experiences to promote and improve the development of other agricultural production cooperatives. For example, during last year's spring plowing, both districts discovered that the phenomenon of idling and waste in agricultural production cooperatives was very serious. The base-point cooperatives summarized the experience of implementing quota management of labor organization and promoted it throughout the district, thus improving the labor efficiency of various agricultural production cooperatives. In order to cultivate and improve the ability of general district cadres to run cooperatives, the district committees also adopted the method of taking apprentices. When conducting pilot projects or solving important problems of agricultural production cooperatives, and when reporting or deploying the work of agricultural production cooperatives, general district cadres are absorbed to participate. This has enabled most cadres to generally master the principles, policies, and business knowledge of agricultural production cooperatives through learning in actual work, and they also have a clear goal for leading and improving mutual aid teams. Currently, fifteen cadres in these two districts have experience in running agricultural production cooperatives, and another thirteen cadres also have general knowledge of running agricultural production cooperatives. This has prepared the conditions for piloting agricultural production cooperatives this year.

    Third, agricultural production cooperatives were piloted through the Party's grassroots organizations, and the agricultural production cooperatives took the lead in launching the patriotic production increase movement. Attention was also paid to improving the work of the agricultural production cooperatives in the patriotic production increase movement, which greatly exerted the role of the Party's grassroots organizations. The specific methods are: 1. After the district cadres arrive in the village, they do not directly go to the agricultural production cooperatives to run the cooperatives, but rather conduct a comprehensive and unified study and deployment of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the entire village through the branch. The district committee participates in the branch committee meetings, organizes the branch committee to assign responsibilities for leading the work of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and regularly concentrates on research and exchange of experiences. 2. Party groups are divided by production organization, and production is promoted through Party members. There are sixteen Party members in the Zhiguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuchang Third District, nine of whom have become model members, and they have played a significant role in leading the masses to promote production. 3. Taking agricultural production cooperatives as the main force, take the lead in launching the patriotic production increase movement, grasp the links that are decisive for production increase, first set an example in the agricultural production cooperatives, and then exchange experiences through organizing mass visits and forums to carry out competitions and promote progress with each other. The benefits of doing so are: on the one hand, it strengthens the connection between agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, expands the influence of agricultural production cooperatives, and promotes the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. For example, after visiting and evaluating, the masses in many villages in Wuchang Third District truly recognized the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. They said, "Cooperatives have many people with one mind, great strength, and the crops grow well." Now more than fifty mutual aid teams are actively creating conditions to prepare to transform into agricultural production cooperatives. On the other hand, it has promoted the technical reform movement. For example, the Zhiguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuchang Third District mobilized women to go to the fields to rake stubble, which promoted the women in the mutual aid teams to go to the fields as well, so that 80% of the land in the entire village was raked. Another example is that after the Meng Xiansheng Mutual Aid Team accepted the experience of collective manure accumulation from the agricultural production cooperatives, they completed the plan of accumulating 1,000 cartloads of manure in seven days.

    Fourth, pay attention to giving play to the role of the management committees of agricultural production cooperatives, and cultivating and improving the working level of the leading cadres of agricultural production cooperatives. The district cadres must first be good "advisers," helping the management committees to study work, formulate plans, and teach working methods. All matters of agricultural production cooperatives must be resolved through the management committees or the cooperative directors to prevent substitution. Secondly, organize the members of the management committees to study relevant documents on agricultural production cooperatives, study the experiences of agricultural production cooperatives in various places, to improve their ideological level and business ability. For example, after the management committee of Yumin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuchang Third District studied the article "How to Be a Good Cooperative Director," the cooperative director changed his "paternalistic" work style; some cooperative directors corrected their ideas of setting up large stalls after studying. In addition, the district committees often convene the directors of each cooperative to summarize work, find out the advantages and disadvantages, and improve the methods.

    松江省两个区委试办农业生产合作社的经验
    陈文志
    松江省桦南县一区和五常县三区去年试办了十五个农业生产合作社。由于这两个区的共产党的委员会加强了对这一工作的领导，试办的十五个农业生产合作社都普遍获得了增产，受到了群众的拥护。桦南一区九个农业生产合作社每垧小麦平均产量是一千二百斤，比当地互助组高出二百斤。五常三区六个农业生产合作社情况也是如此。这就增加了农民的收入，新立农业生产合作社预计每个劳动日能分到六十多斤粮食。农业生产合作社的这种成就，推动了整个互助合作运动的发展。比如常年互助组、季节互助组都较一九五二年有所增加，临时互助组则较一九五二年减少。另一方面，区委在这次试办工作中，显著地提高了对农业生产合作社的领导能力。这两个区的区委在领导方法上有以下几个共同的特点：
      首先是能够认真地钻研党的互助合作政策和学习其他地区的互助合作工作经验。这是区委办好农业生产合作社的根本条件之一。区委本来对农业生产合作社的工作是不熟悉的，但是现在要做这一工作，而且必须做好这一工作，这就要学习，这两个区都采取了这个正确的态度。在学习中，他们还采取了边学、边做、边改进的方法。在工作开始前，首先学习有关文件，弄通思想，在工作进行中如发现问题，随时研究解决。同时定期由主要负责干部作关于农业生产合作社各项问题的专题报告，发动干部进行讨论。这就有效地提高了大家领导农业生产合作社的能力。
    其次，区委对农业生产合作社实行集体领导，发挥了集体智慧与创造。具体方法是：区委把试办农业生产合作社作为一项重要工作，和其他工作统一研究、统一布置，区委根据需要，随时召集大家开会，汇报情况，集中研究，交流经验。为了提高区委集体领导效能，在试办工作中又建立了基点社。基点社的作用是先走一步，及时发现问题，总结经验，以推动和提高其他农业生产合作社向前发展。如去年春耕时，这两个区都发现农业生产合作社的窝工浪费现象很严重，基点社便总结出实行劳动组织定额管理的经验，推广到全区，因此提高了各个农业生产合作社的劳动效率。为了培养和提高一般区干部的办社能力，区委还采取了带徒弟的办法，在进行试点或解决农业生产合作社的重要问题时，在汇报或布置农业生产合作社工作时，都吸收一般区干部参加。这就使多数干部经过在实际工作中的学习，一般地都掌握了农业生产合作社的方针、政策和业务知识，而且对领导和提高互助组也有了明确的目标。目前这两个区有十五名干部已有了办农业生产合作社的经验，另有十三名干部也具有了办农业生产合作社的一般知识。这就给今年试办农业生产合作社准备了条件。
    第三，通过党的基层组织去试办农业生产合作社，并以农业生产合作社带头开展爱国增产运动，在爱国增产运动中又注意改进农业生产合作社的工作，这就大大发挥了党的基层组织的作用。具体作法是：一、区干部到村以后，不是直接钻到农业生产合作社里去办社，而是通过支部对全村的互助合作运动作全面的统一的研究和布置。区委参加支委会，组织支委分工负责领导农业生产合作社及互助组工作，并定期集中研究，交流经验。二、以生产组织划分党的小组，通过党员推动生产。五常三区志广农业生产合作社有十六名党员，其中有九名都成了模范社员，他们对带领群众推动生产起了很大的作用。三、以农业生产合作社为主，带头开展爱国增产运动，抓住对增产有决定意义的环节，首先在农业生产合作社作出样子来，然后通过组织群众参观、座谈等方式交流经验，开展竞赛，互相推动前进。这样做的好处是：一方面密切了农业生产合作社与互助组的联系，扩大了农业生产合作社的影响，推动了互助合作运动的发展。比如五常三区许多村的群众，经过参观、评比以后，真正认识到农业生产合作社的优越性，他们说：“合作社人多心齐，力量大，庄稼长的好。”现在已经有五十多个互助组积极创造条件，准备转为农业生产合作社。另一方面，推动了技术改革运动。如五常三区志广农业生产合作社发动妇女下地搂槎子、便推动了互助组的妇女也下了地，使全村百分之八十的土地搂了槎子。又如孟宪生互助组接受了农业生产合作社集体积肥的经验后，在七天内便完成了积一千车粪肥的计划。
    第四，经常注意发挥农业生产合作社管理委员会的作用，培养和提高农业生产合作社领导干部的工作水平。区干部首先要当好“参谋”，帮助管理委员会研究工作，制订计划，并教给工作方法，农业生产合作社的一切事情，都要通过管理委员会或社主任去解决，防止包办代替。其次组织管理委员会的委员学习有关农业生产合作社的文件，研究各地农业生产合作社的经验，用以提高他们的思想水平和业务能力。如五常三区裕民农业生产合作社管理委员会学习了“怎样当好社主任”一篇文章后，社主任便转变了“家长制”的工作作风；有的社主任经过学习以后，纠正了摆大摊子想法。此外，区委还经常召集各社主任总结工作，找出优缺点和改进办法。
