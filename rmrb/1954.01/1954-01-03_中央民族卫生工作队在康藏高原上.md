    The Central National Health Work Team on the Kangzang Plateau
    Li Peilan
    A Tense Night

    One dusky evening, as we were studying, a local villager came. He anxiously called out, "Menba!" (meaning doctor). Upon asking, we learned that a woman was about to give birth. We quickly grabbed the midwifery kit and rushed to the expectant mother's home.

    The mother-to-be was a petite woman with a small pelvis, while the fetus was not small. Comrade Tian patiently attended to her, advising her not to move too much (because she had high blood pressure). At the end of the first stage of labor, the mother suddenly changed, experiencing convulsions throughout her body and soon losing consciousness.

    It was already midnight, and the weather was particularly cold; the wind howled fiercely. The expectant mother's elderly mother cried anxiously. We comforted her while also feeling worried. The mother's condition was serious, and we feared for the lives of both mother and child. I gave her an injection of morphine and listened to her fetal heart sounds from time to time. Before long, the mother's convulsions worsened, and her breathing became labored. Around one o'clock, we could no longer hear the fetal heart. At this point, we felt very distressed and tried our best to save the adult's life. However, because of her small pelvis, forceps would be needed. If we sent her to the military hospital, we would have to cross a suspension bridge. At that time, snow had covered the entire road, and we didn't know the way at night. What could we do? Just as we were worried, Captain Li arrived. She discussed with us how to rescue the patient. Finally, it was decided to send the mother to the military hospital.

    We anxiously waited for dawn while monitoring her condition and patiently caring for her, giving her sedative injections on time.

    As soon as it was light, we immediately sent her to the military hospital, where she underwent surgery quickly and her condition improved. We felt as if a weight had been lifted from our hearts, and we felt so happy and relieved. But we were still unwilling to leave this young mother, and we continued to watch over her in the ward. At two o'clock in the afternoon, seeing that she was doing well, we returned to the team with peace of mind.

    The next day, when we went to see her, we met her husband on the road. Before I could speak, he happily said, "Baima (meaning the expectant mother) has already spoken. Ah, it's so lucky to have met your health team. I have never seen such good doctors!" When we went to her home again, the expectant mother's mother smiled and held our hands. Her eyes fixed on our faces, speaking with a mother's gentleness, "These are the doctors educated by Chairman Mao." She was overjoyed when she heard the news that her daughter could be discharged from the hospital in five days.

    After regaining her health, the young mother participated in a new midwifery training class. She studied very diligently.

      Precious Feelings

    In Rongba Cha, magnificent snow-capped mountains stand before us. Whenever the sun sets, the snow on the mountains shines with dazzling light. The river flows swiftly, and ice blocks hit the stones, stirring up white waves; silver-gray wild birds often fly in flocks, heading towards the distant forests.

    One evening, an old man with white hair rushed to our workplace. He said to me, "Comrades, you are too busy. Take your clothes and let us wash them!" I said, "Uncle! You are too old, we can wash them ourselves." "No, I must wash them for you. You have come here from distant Beijing,不怕辛苦 (不怕辛苦 is a common Chinese idiom that can be translated as “not afraid of hardship”) treating us and saving many lives. I want to use this little gesture to express my gratitude to Chairman Mao." His face, full of wrinkles, revealed sincere and lovely feelings. How deeply this sincere and simple emotion moved me!

    The villagers are so fond of the comrades in the health team. They often put food in the comrades' arms and ask with concern: Are you cold? Are you tired? One patient who was cured by us quietly swept the floor of the examination room when we were studying in the morning. "Thank you! We can sweep it ourselves!" we said to him. But he just answered with a slight smile and continued sweeping. Some villagers often come to fan the stove for us or help with propaganda work.

      A young woman who was very ill moved from a distant place to the kitchen next door to us for treatment. Illness tormented her, making her unable to move; painful groans came from the kitchen from time to time. Her husband paced back and forth anxiously. After several treatments by the health team, she quickly recovered her health. She looked so beautiful and happy. She always stood in front of my work door, as if she wanted to say something, but because of the language barrier, she did not speak, just smiled. From then on, she often came to help us and maintain order in the clinic.

    The comrades in the health team also love the villagers very much. No matter how strong the cold wind blows or how heavy the snow falls outside, they still run to places dozens of miles away to see patients and take care of them.

    Although we have only been here for a month, we have established close ties with the villagers and developed deep feelings for each other; these feelings are precious, and we must preserve them.

      "A Niang" Transformed

    Taguo is a student in the new midwifery training class in Daofu County. She studies very diligently. The people in the health team have been with her for more than a year, and no one has ever seen her have a moment of free time. She studies with a book in her hand while walking, eating, and even a moment before the start of a get-together. At night, when the comrades are asleep, she lights a candle to study. Through continuous efforts, she has finally mastered general women's health knowledge, as well as new midwifery and nursing knowledge such as intramuscular and subcutaneous injections and disinfection dressings. She used to be illiterate, but now she has learned more than a thousand characters and can read simple books and newspapers.

    Taguo not only studies well herself but also helps others to study. When she led the study group for the new midwifery training class in Luhuo and Ganzi counties, she often said to the Tibetan women participating in the study, "Study hard! Chairman Mao cares about us so much and sent people to run training classes for our own benefit. We must study well and relieve the pain of childbirth for women of our ethnic group."

    After Taguo graduated and went to work in the countryside, she went to deliver babies, examine, and visit pregnant women, regardless of day or night, wind or rain, climbing mountains and wading through rivers. She also seized every opportunity to publicize women's and children's health knowledge to women. Her sister Zerong was pregnant but unwilling to undergo prenatal check-ups. The midwife from the county health center looked for her three times, but Zerong hid every time and refused to see them. There were also six other pregnant women who were unwilling to have prenatal check-ups. Taguo started with her sister first, mobilizing her once and again, explaining the benefits of new midwifery from all aspects, and patiently persuading her all night, targeting Zerong's shyness. Zerong finally went to the health center to receive a prenatal check-up. When Taguo was about to go to Luhuo County, she heard that a woman in a distant village was about to give birth, so she rushed to deliver her baby.

    Taguo is as affectionate to the comrades of the health brigade as if they were her own family. Whether during marches or at work, she often takes care of the comrades meticulously, like an older sister taking care of her younger siblings. Therefore, the comrades in the team all call her "A Niang" (meaning Mother). Everyone likes to work and study with her, and "A Niang" also likes to be with the Han comrades.

    Taguo is forty-three years old this year. She started living a wandering life at the age of eight and has never had a happy day. Now, "A Niang" has changed, becoming a spirited and cheerful person. The comrades in the team can often be heard calling out, "A Niang! A Niang!" She always smiles and chats with everyone. If someone asks, "A Niang! Why do you study so hard?" A Niang will say, "Chairman Mao wants us mothers and children to be safe and wants us to be our own masters. Shouldn't I study hard?"

    中央民族卫生工作队在康藏高原上

    紧张的一夜
    一个暮色苍茫的傍晚，我们正在学习的时候，来了一个老乡。他慌张地唤着：“门巴！”（即医生）。一问，原来有一个女人要生孩子了。我们便急忙拿起接生箱，奔到产妇的家中。
    产妇是一个身材矮小的妇女，她的骨盆较小，而胎儿却并不小。田同志很耐心地侍候着她，劝她不要多动（因为她血压较高）。至第一产程终了时，产妇突起变化，全身痉挛、不一会就昏迷不知人事。
    这时已是深夜十二点钟，气候特别冷；风刮得呼呼的响。产妇的老母亲急得哭了。我们一面安慰她，一面担心着。因为产妇的情况是严重的，恐怕母亲和胎儿有生命的危险。我给她注射了一针吗啡，又不时地听着她的胎心。不一会产妇抽搐得更厉害了，呼吸陷于困难状态中，到一点多钟的时候，再也听不到胎心了。这时我们心里很难受，尽量设法救大人的生命。可是她的骨盆小，须动产钳。如果送她到军区医院，须经过铁索桥。那时积雪已将整个的道路覆盖了，而且在夜晚我们也不认识路，怎么办呢？正在焦急的时候，李队长来了。她和我们一起商量想法抢救病人。最后决定把产妇送到军区医院。
    我们一面焦急地等待着天明，一面注意着她的病状的变化，耐心地护理她，给她按时注射镇静剂。
    天一明，我们立刻把她送到军区医院，迅速动了手术，情况良好。于是我们好像移去了心上的石头，感到那样的愉快轻松。但我们还不愿意离开这年轻的产妇，仍然在病房内看着她。下午二点钟，见她一切情况都好，我们才安心地回了队。
    第二天去看她时，我们在路上遇到了她的丈夫。不等我开口，他很高兴地说：“白马（产妇的意思）已经说话了。啊，这真幸运，遇上了你们卫生队。我从来也没有见过这样好的医生！”我们再一次到她家里去时，产妇的母亲笑着，牵着我们的手。她的眼盯着我们的脸，带着一种母亲的和蔼说着：“这才是毛主席教育出来的医生。”当她听说女儿五天后就可以出院的消息时高兴极了。
    年轻的产妇恢复健康后，参加了新法接生员训练班。她学习得很认真。
      珍贵的感情
    在绒坝岔。巍峨的雪山，耸立在我们的面前。每当夕阳西下的时候，山上的积雪闪着耀眼的光芒。河水湍急地流着，冰块碰在石上，激起雪白的浪花；银灰色的野鸟，不时成群地掠过，向远处的山林飞去。
    一天傍晚，一位头发苍白的老翁，慌张地跑到我们工作的地方。他对我说：“同志，你们太忙了，把你们的衣服，拿来给我们洗！”我说：“老乡！你的年纪太大了，我们自己会洗的。”“不，我一定给你们洗。你们从那遥远的北京来到这里，不怕辛苦，给我们治病，救了好多人的生命。我要用这点心意来表示对毛主席的感激。”他满是绉纹的脸上，流露着真挚可爱的感情。这诚恳、朴实的情感，是如何的激动着我啊！
    老乡们是那样热爱卫生队的同志，他们经常拿着吃的东西塞在同志们的怀里，还关心地问着：冷吗？累吗？一位被我们医好的病人，当我们早上在学习的时候，他悄悄地扫起诊断室的地来。“谢谢你！我们自己扫吧！”我们对他说。可是他只是用微微的一笑来回答，继续扫着地。有些老乡经常来替我们煽炉火，或者帮助做宣传工作。
      一位病得很重的青年妇女，从很远的地方搬到我们隔壁的灶房里来治病。病魔折磨着她，使她一步也不能移动；痛苦的呻吟声，不时从灶房里发出来。她的丈夫急得来回乱转。经卫生队几次治疗后，她迅速恢复了健康。她显得那样的美丽和愉快，她总是站在我工作的门前，像要说什么话似的，但由于语言的关系，她不作声，只是微笑着。从此以后，她经常来帮助我们，为门诊室维持着秩序。
    卫生队的同志们也同样热爱老乡们，无论外面刮多大的寒风，下多大的雪，他们照样跑到几十里路以外的地方去给群众看病，去照顾病人。
    我们虽然到这里只有一个月的光景，但已和老乡们建立起密切的联系，彼此之间产生了深厚的感情；这种感情是珍贵的，我们要把它保持下来。
      “阿娘”变样了
    他果是道孚县新法接生员训练班的学员，她学习很用心。卫生队的人和她相处一年多了，没有一个人看见她有片刻的空闲。她在走路时、吃饭时，甚至在联欢会开始前的一刻都手不释卷地学习着。夜里，同志们都睡了，她却点起蜡烛学习。经过不断的努力，她终于掌握了一般的妇女卫生常识，以及新法接生和肌肉、皮下注射和消毒换药等护理知识。她以前一个字也不识，现在她学会了一千多字，能看简单的书报了。
    他果不但自己学得很好，而且还帮助别人学习。她在炉霍、甘孜县领导新法接生员训练班的小组学习时，常常向参加学习的藏族妇女说：“好好学习吧！毛主席这样关心我们，为了我们自己的事情派人来办训练班，我们一定要学习好，给本民族妇女解除生产中的痛苦。”
    他果毕业后下乡工作时，不分昼夜、不顾风雨，爬山涉水去给产妇接生、检查、访视。她并抓紧每一个机会向妇女们宣传妇幼卫生常识。她妹妹泽绒怀了孕，不愿意受产前检查，县卫生院的助产士找了她三次，泽绒每次都藏起来不见人。另外有六个孕妇也是如此，不愿意作产前检查。他果首先从她妹妹开始，一次两次地动员，从各方面说明新法接生的好处，又针对泽绒怕羞的思想耐心地对她劝了一晚上，泽绒终于到卫生院去接受了产前检查。她果刚要到炉霍县时，听说远处一个寨子里有一个妇女要生产，她就连忙赶去，给她接生。
    他果对卫生大队的同志们亲热得如同一家人，不管在行军的时候或工作的时候，她经常无微不至地照顾同志们，好像一个大姐照顾弟妹一样。因此，队里面的同志，都叫她“阿娘”。大家都很喜欢和她在一起工作和学习，“阿娘”也很喜欢和汉族同志们在一起。
    他果今年已四十三岁了。从八岁起她就开始过流浪生活，没有一天快活过。现在，“阿娘”变了样，成为一个精神饱满、心情愉快的人了。队里常常可以听见同志们喊：“阿娘！阿娘！”她总是笑容满面地和大家谈笑着。如果有人问：“阿娘！你为什么这样努力学习呢？”阿娘就会说：“毛主席要使我们母子都平安，要我们自己当家作主，我还不好好学习吗！”
