　　Volunteer Army Units Actively Prepare for Universal Suffrage
　　Some Units Have Begun Grassroots Elections
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army units are actively preparing for universal suffrage, and many units have already started grassroots elections.

    The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued instructions on universal suffrage work to the entire army in late December of last year. In order to guide the entire army in carrying out universal suffrage work, leading cadres of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and leading cadres of various units formed election committees, with Zhang Nansheng, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, as chairman. Various units have also successively established election committees at all levels and are actively preparing for universal suffrage. Many units have also widely carried out publicity and education work on participating in elections.

    Before the election, various units conducted voter review and registration in accordance with voter qualifications. In the grassroots elections, the candidates nominated by each unit have undergone repeated discussions.

    The command organization of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army on the eastern front solemnly conducted grassroots elections. On the day of the vote, cadres and soldiers hung bright colorful flags around the election venue and red palace lanterns at the entrance. All cadres and soldiers participating in the election wore various medals, awards, and commemorative badges they had won in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and marched into the venue in joyous procession. They carefully wrote the names of the people they considered most satisfactory on the ballots and solemnly placed the ballots into the ballot box. Leading cadres of the unit also participated in the voting along with the soldiers.

    The companies where the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Special-Class Hero Huang Jiguang and First-Class Hero Qiu Shaoyun served before their deaths held grand election meetings in their respective garrison areas. The soldiers of the company where Huang Jiguang served before his death posted the slogan "Be the masters of our own house" at the venue. They also decorated the ballot box with red and green colored paper. At the election meeting, Chen Xinhuai, a second-class meritorious soldier of the company, said: "Our ability to freely elect our own representatives is the victory won by the Communist Party leading the people of the motherland through decades of struggle. In the future, we must stand even more vigilantly at our posts and strive to defend the economic construction of the motherland and world peace."

　　志愿军各部队积极进行普选准备工作
　　部分单位已开始了基层选举工作
    中国人民志愿军各部队积极进行普选准备工作，许多部队已开始了基层选举。
    中国人民志愿军政治部于去年十二月下旬向全军发布了关于普选工作的指示。为了指导全军进行普选工作，中国人民志愿军领导干部和各部队领导干部，组成了选举委员会，由中国人民志愿军政治部副主任张南生任主席。各部队也相继成立了各级选举委员会，积极进行普选准备工作。许多部队还普遍进行了参加选举的宣传教育工作。
    各部队在选举之前，按照选民条件进行了选民的审查、登记。在基层选举中，各单位提出的候选人，都经过反复的讨论。
    东线志愿军某部指挥机关，隆重地进行了基层选举。在投票那一天，干部、战士在选举会场的周围挂上了鲜艳的彩旗，在入口处挂上红色的宫灯。所有参加选举的干部、战士都戴上了在抗美援朝斗争中荣获的各种勋章、奖章和纪念章，喜气洋洋地列队走入会场。他们认真地将自己认为最满意的人的名字写在选票上，慎重地把选票投入票箱。该部领导干部也和战士们一起参加了投票。
    中国人民志愿军特级英雄黄继光烈士和一级英雄邱少云烈士生前所在的连队，都在各自驻地举行了隆重的选举大会。黄继光烈士生前所在连队的战士们，在会场上贴着“当家做主人”的标语。他们还用红绿彩纸将票箱装饰起来。在选举大会上，该连二等功臣陈新怀说：“我们能自由地选举自己的代表，是共产党领导祖国人民经过数十年的斗争换来的胜利。今后，我们要更加警惕地站在自己的岗位上，为保卫祖国的经济建设和世界和平而奋斗。”
