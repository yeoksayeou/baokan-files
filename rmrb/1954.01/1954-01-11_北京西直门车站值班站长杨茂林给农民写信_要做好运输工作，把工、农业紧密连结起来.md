Yang Maolin, Station Master on Duty at Beijing Xizhimen Station, Writes to Farmers:
    Do a Good Job in Transportation, and Closely Link Industry and Agriculture
    Dear Farmer Brothers:
    Opening the newspaper, I see news every day about farmers increasing production and supporting national construction, and I really don't know what to say to thank you enough. In the past, there was a large open space outside Xizhimen, but in just a few years after liberation, tall buildings have been built one after another. Every day when I go to and from work, passing by there, I am very excited. I always want to tell you, "You also have a share in this!" The road outside Xizhimen used to be very narrow, and accidents often occurred, but now four large cars can drive side by side, and it's still spacious. Mentougou used to be a small place, but in the past two years, many new houses have been built, and it has changed greatly. Dear farmer brothers, you all have a share in supporting national construction!
    I am ashamed to say that our work has not been completed very well. Before September of last year, we had never completed our tasks here. Later, we improved the work plan, and with the help of Soviet experts who came to the station to help us assemble train cars, we quickly reversed the situation and hoisted the October victory red flag at our station. Although the November task was completed well, there were four accidents, and as a result, the red flag was taken away by another station. This is the result of our only caring about production and forgetting to combine production and safety. After discussion and research among all of us, we have now proposed many methods to prevent accidents. Dear farmer brothers, we must work hard to improve our work, drive the train quickly and safely, and transport the new-style agricultural tools, fertilizers, and fabrics and daily necessities that you need to you, so that you can rest assured to produce, produce more grain, and produce more other agricultural products. On the other hand, we must also transport the crops you have already produced to the city as soon as possible to supply the needs of the factories. Dear farmer brothers, let us join hands and stride forward on the victorious road of the second year of the Five-Year Plan!
        Yang Maolin, Station Master on Duty at Beijing Xizhimen Station

    北京西直门车站值班站长杨茂林给农民写信
    要做好运输工作，把工、农业紧密连结起来
    亲爱的农民兄弟们：
    翻开报纸，天天看到农民增加生产、支援国家建设的消息，我真不知该说什么来感激你们才好。西直门外过去有好大一片都是空地，可是解放后才几年，一幢幢的高楼就一个紧接着一个盖起来了。每天当我上下班走过那里的时候，心情就很激动，我总想告诉你们说：“这里也有你们的功劳！”西直门外的马路，过去很窄，常常出事故，可是现在四辆大汽车并排走，都松松宽宽的。门头沟原来也是个小地方，这两年盖了不少的新房子，也大大地改了样。亲爱的农民兄弟们，这里头都有你们支援国家建设的功劳呀！
    说来惭愧，我们的工作却完成得不怎样出色。去年九月以前，我们这里一向完不成任务，后来改进了作业计划，加上苏联专家亲自到车站帮我们搞成组装车，这才迅速扭转了局面，把十月份的优胜红旗插到了我们车站。十一月任务虽然完成得不错，可是却出了四件事故，结果红旗又被别的车站拿跑了。这就是我们光顾生产，忘了把生产和安全结合起来的结果。经过我们大伙讨论研究，现在我们已经提出不少防止事故的方法。亲爱的农民兄弟们，我们一定要努力改进工作，把火车开得又快又安全，把你们需用的新式农具、肥料和布匹、日用品运到你们手里，使你们安心生产，多打粮食多生产其他农产品。另一方面我们也要尽快地把你们已经生产出来的农作物运到城里，供应工厂需要。亲爱的农民兄弟们，让我们手拉着手，大步迈上五年计划第二年的胜利路程吧！
            北京西直门车站值班站长杨茂林
