Acupuncture, one of the precious heritages of our great motherland in the field of medicine, has been widely promoted and adopted throughout the country, and is welcomed by the broad masses of urban and rural people.

The method of treating diseases with acupuncture has a history of thousands of years in our country. This medical method is not only economical and convenient, but also has remarkable effects on many diseases. The medical circles of all countries in the world attach great importance to acupuncture. The French medical community published the "Complete Book of Chinese Medicine" as early as 1867, which introduced Chinese acupuncture therapy. People in the United States and Italy have also learned acupuncture. In Japan, specialized institutions for studying acupuncture were established a long time ago. The Soviet medical community attaches great importance to Chinese acupuncture therapy, and many medical scientists have been conducting research in recent years.

Acupuncture was widely used in the liberated areas during the Liberation War. After the nationwide liberation, in order to systematically study and promote acupuncture, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government established the Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute in Beijing in 1951. The institute has trained more than 100 acupuncture technicians, including university professors, teaching assistants, hospital directors, physicians, medical assistants, nurses, midwives, and public health personnel. The institute also organized a work team to train more than 40 students in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and gave acupuncture lectures to more than 80 students who were about to graduate from the Inner Mongolia Health School. The work team trained more than 120 students in Xikang and helped the Health Bureau of the Central and South Administrative Committee train 40 students in the acupuncture teacher training class. These students are working in nine centrally administered municipalities, twenty-four provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In order to promote acupuncture, the Beijing Society of Traditional Chinese Medicine established the Acupuncture Research Committee, which has successively held four sessions of amateur acupuncture training classes, in which more than 300 old acupuncture doctors have been reformed and improved. Under the call of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, from 1952 to 1953, the committee organized eight acupuncture teams to go to chronic disease sanatoriums in Xinxiang, Shandong, Anhui, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu and other places to treat patients with acupuncture. Many provinces and cities across the country have opened acupuncture training courses, and many colleges and universities of medicine and secondary medical schools have established acupuncture institutions and added acupuncture courses. Employee hospitals in Benxi, Anshan, Datong, Huainan, Taiyuan and other places have also promoted acupuncture therapy.

The fact that acupuncture has been promoted throughout the country proves that the medical effect of acupuncture is quite good. According to statistics from the Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, in the first year of its establishment, a total of 2,605 people were treated with acupuncture. Most of these patients were chronic diseases that had not been cured for a long time, including 158 kinds of diseases. The effective rate of acupuncture treatment reached about 90%. According to statistics from the Guangdong Provincial Experimental Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from June to October 1953, the total number of patients diagnosed was 306, of which 207 were cured or improved. From June to November 1953, Guangzhou People's Hospital treated 434 patients with acupuncture, with an effective rate of more than 84.5%. In the two months of promoting acupuncture, four hospitals including Guangxi Provincial People's Hospital treated a total of 844 patients with acupuncture, including 60 kinds of diseases, with an effective rate of more than 77%; some of them are still under treatment, and less than 5% have been confirmed to be ineffective.

The promotion and application of acupuncture have restored the health of many patients who have been treated for a long time without success. Wang Yinsheng, a cadre of the Zhongnan Engineering Warehouse in Qiaokou District, Wuhan City, suffered from systemic spasm, with 50 or 60 convulsions a day and night. He was in a coma for three days and nights. After treatment at the Acupuncture Clinic of Wuhan City, he regained consciousness in just a few days, and the convulsions disappeared completely. A patient named Huang Dayuan in Fujian Province initially had a runny nose and purulent discharge, and often had headaches. Later, the headache worsened, the limbs convulsed, the whole body sweated profusely, his consciousness was blurred, his legs were numb and trembling, and he could not walk. A large number of injections of vitamin B and other drugs were ineffective. After 24 acupuncture treatments, his legs had completely recovered. Rong Lixia, a resident of Guangzhou City, suffered from rheumatic arthritis for more than ten years, with emaciation and bone pain all over her body, and it was very difficult to walk. After 27 acupuncture treatments, she recovered her health. Lu Youshan, a resident of Nanning City, Guangxi Province, suffered from hemiplegia (sequelae of cerebral hemorrhage) and was bedridden for several months. Various methods of treatment were ineffective. After more than ten acupuncture treatments, the swelling of his feet disappeared completely, and he could move freely without a cane. Duoxi Pengcuo, a lama from Anjue Temple in Kangding, Xikang Province, suffered from stomach and intestinal diseases for 40 years and was treated by more than 60 doctors without success. After acupuncture treatment, the disease was completely cured.

Hospitals across the country have also tried acupuncture to treat tuberculosis. The Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government cooperated with Beijing Medical College and Peking Union Medical College Hospital to treat tuberculosis. After eight acupuncture treatments, 13 tuberculosis patients experienced the disappearance of all or part of their symptoms such as night sweats, insomnia, fever, and loss of appetite. The institute selected one patient with proliferative tuberculosis and two patients with fibrotic tuberculosis and tried acupuncture treatment without any medication. After three months of acupuncture treatment, proliferative tuberculosis was completely cured. Among the two patients with fibrotic tuberculosis, one had calcified and the other had stopped developing and was moving towards calcification. The Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government also discovered that acupuncture has a preventive effect of enhancing the body's resistance. The institute cooperated with the Department of Bacteriology of Beijing Medical College and the Luhe Hospital in Hebei to conduct a preliminary observation of increasing "complement" in 34 people: after five or six days of acupuncture, the "complement" did show an increasing trend.

　　针灸疗法已在全国各地广泛地推广和采用
    伟大祖国在医学方面的珍贵遗产之一——针灸疗法已在全国各地广泛地推广和采用，受到广大城乡人民的欢迎。
    用针灸治病的方法，在我国已有几千年的历史。这种医疗方法，不仅经济方便，并对不少疾病确有卓越效果。世界各国医学界对于针灸疗法都很重视。法国医学界远在一八六七年就出版了“中国医学大全”，介绍了中国针灸疗法。美国和意大利并有人学会了针灸。在日本，很早以前就设有研究针灸疗法的专门机构。苏联医学界对中国的针灸疗法极为重视，近几年也有不少医学家在进行研究。
    针灸疗法，在解放战争时期就在解放区内广泛采用。全国解放以后，中央人民政府卫生部为了有计划地研究和推广针灸疗法，一九五一年在北京成立了针灸疗法实验所。该所已培养了一百多名针灸疗法技术人员，其中有大学教授、助教、医院院长、医师、医士、护士、助产士和公共卫生人员等。该所并组织了工作组，到内蒙古自治区培养了四十多名学员，并给内蒙卫生学校八十多名快要毕业的学生讲了针灸课。工作组在西康培养了一百二十多名学员，并帮助中南行政委员会卫生局针灸师资训练班培养了四十名学员。这些学员分布在九个中央直辖市、二十四个省及内蒙古自治区工作。北京市中医学会为了推广针灸疗法，特成立了针灸研究委员会，该会先后举办了四期针灸疗法业余学习班，有三百多名旧针灸医生得到改造和提高。该会在中央人民政府卫生部号召下，从一九五二年到一九五三年先后组织了八个针灸小组，分赴新乡、山东、安徽、绥远、河北、山西、陕西、甘肃等地的慢性病疗养院为病人用针灸疗法治病。全国有许多省市开办了针灸疗法训练班，不少高等医学院校和中级医药学校都设立了针灸机构和增添了针灸课程。本溪、鞍山、大同、淮南、太原等地的职工医院也都推行了针灸疗法。
    全国各地推行针灸疗法的事实证明，针灸疗法的医疗效果相当好。据中央人民政府卫生部针灸疗法实验所的统计，在该所成立的最初一年，共给二千六百零五人施行了针灸疗法。这些病人中，绝大部分是久治不愈的慢性病，包括一百五十八种疾病。采用针灸疗法的有效率达百分之九十左右。广东省中医实验医院从一九五三年六月到十月的统计，诊病人数共三百零六人，已治好和好转的有二百零七人。广州市人民医院自一九五三年六月到十一月，用针灸治疗病人四百三十四人，有效率达百分之八十四点五强。广西省人民中医院等四所医院在推广针灸疗法的两个月中，共用针灸疗法治疗八百四十四个病人，包括六十种疾病，有效率达百分之七十七强；其中有一部分正在治疗中，已经肯定无效的不到百分之五。
    针灸疗法的推广和采用，使许多经长期治疗无效的病人恢复了健康。武汉市硚口区中南工程仓库干部王荫生患全身痉挛症，一天一夜抽风五、六十次，曾昏迷三天不醒，经武汉市针灸疗法门诊部的治疗，在短短几天内就恢复了知觉，抽风现象已完全消失。福建省一个叫黄达元的病人，起初两鼻流涕、流脓，时常头痛。以后头痛加剧，四肢痉挛，全身出冷汗，意识模糊不清，两腿麻木颤抖，不能走路，曾大量注射乙种维他命等药都无效。施行针灸疗法二十四次以后，他的两腿已完全恢复了健康。广州市居民容丽霞，患了十多年的风湿性关节炎，全身消瘦骨痛，走路很吃力，施行针灸二十七次后，便恢复了健康。广西省南宁市居民陆友善患半身不遂症（脑溢血后遗症），卧床数月，用各种方法医治无效，经用针灸疗法十多次后，脚肿全消，不用手杖也可以行动自如了。西康省康定安觉寺一位喇嘛多喜彭错，患了四十年的胃肠病，先后经过六十多个医生医治无效，施行针灸疗法后，病已全部好了。
    各地医院还试用针灸疗法治疗肺结核病。中央人民政府卫生部针灸疗法实验所曾与北京医学院、中国协和医院配合治疗肺结核病，十三名肺结核患者经过八次针灸后，患者的盗汗、失眠、发热、食欲不振等症状，有的全部症状消失，有的部分症状消失。该所曾选择一名增殖性肺结核病人和两名纤维性肺结核病人试用针灸治疗，完全不用药品。经过三个月针灸治疗，增殖性肺结核已全部治好，两个纤维性肺结核患者中，一名已钙化，另一名已停止发展，走向钙化。中央人民政府卫生部针灸疗法实验所还发现了针灸疗法有增强人体抵抗力的预防作用。该所曾与北京医学院细菌科和河北潞河医院合作，进行了三十四个人增加“补体”的初步观察：针灸五、六天后，“补体”确有增加的趋势。
