Investigation of Fertilizer Application in Youxi County, Fujian Province Over the Years and Suggestions on Mobilizing Farmers to Increase Fertilizer Application Reasonably
The Youxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China

In order to effectively guide the great production movement of 1954 and strive for a greater harvest of grain, we specially dispatched cadres to form a working group to investigate and summarize the situation, experience, and existing problems of farmers' fertilizer accumulation and application in the past three years in several districts and townships that can represent the whole county. Now we will introduce the results of the investigation as follows:

  I. Basic Situation

During the rule of the reactionary government before liberation, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land in these areas did not exceed three and a half dan. The highest was Mayang Township in the first district, with an average of 4.7 dan of fertilizer per mu of paddy field and 3.5 dan per mu of dry land. Generally, like Yamu Township in the eighth district, the average was three dan per mu of paddy field and two and a half dan per mu of dry land. The lowest was Heping Township in the first district, with an average of two dan per mu of paddy field, and even less fertilizer was applied to dry land, and some remote fields were not fertilized at all. The types of fertilizer were generally only three: plant ash, human manure, and livestock manure. In terms of rational fertilization, there was no improvement except for the several methods commonly used by farmers. Therefore, the level of agricultural production was very low and declining year by year.

In the four years after liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, after various social reform movements, especially after the implementation of land reform, farmers were given land and various means of production, and their enthusiasm for production was very high. The amount of fertilizer accumulated and applied in various places has also increased year by year, and new sources of fertilizer have been developed. Before land reform, only three kinds of fertilizer were used: human manure, plant ash, and livestock manure. Now several kinds have been added, and the quality of various fertilizers has been improved to varying degrees, especially in 1952 and 1953. According to the investigation in the Huang Qingqi mutual aid group (general group) in Xiaqiao Township, Sixth District, the total cultivated land area of the group is 46.64 mu. Before liberation, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu was 6 dan. In 1952, the amount was 13.5 dan per mu, more than double that before liberation. In 1953, the average amount was 20 dan per mu, an increase of about 50% compared with 1952. They also applied different fertilizers according to different soil types. As the amount of fertilizer applied increased year by year, the yield also increased accordingly. For example, the cultivated land area of Yamu Township in the Eighth District is 2,047.56 mu. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the total annual output was 801,658 jin, an average of 391 jin per mu. Before liberation, the total annual output was 672,359 jin, an average of 328 jin per mu. In 1951, the output was 697,486 jin, an average of 340 jin per mu. In 1952, the output was 833,725 jin, an average of 407 jin per mu. The output in 1952 increased by 4% compared with the pre-Anti-Japanese War period, 24.6% compared with the pre-liberation period, and 20% compared with 1951. The rice grew better in 1953 than in any previous year. These increased yields are inseparable from the increased application of fertilizer and the improvement of fertilization techniques.

At the same time, after three years of fertilization technical guidance, bank loan support, and timely supply from cooperatives, the masses have become accustomed to using commercial fertilizers, and the demand for commercial fertilizers has increased year by year. The county used 30,000 jin of fertilaizer powder and 8,000 jin of ammonium sulfate in 1951; more than 95,000 jin of fertilaizer powder, more than 20,000 jin of ammonium sulfate, and more than 25,000 jin of bone meal (excluding those sold by private industrial and commercial enterprises) in 1952; and 153,400 jin of fertilaizer powder, 32,300 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 9,400 jin of bone meal by September 1953. Farmers generally reported that fertilaizer powder is good and works quickly.

  II. Several Experiences

(1) Implementing policy publicity, eliminating ideological concerns of the masses, and giving play to the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers are the foundation for carrying out mass fertilizer accumulation. During the land reform in the winter of 1950 and the spring of 1951 in our county, we vigorously publicized that the purpose of land reform was to develop production, and after land reform, we publicized and implemented various agricultural production policies. Many cadres went deep into the masses to understand local farming habits and fertilizer accumulation and application, adopting a combination of individual interviews and holding forums with veteran farmers to summarize the experience of increasing production, fully carry out ideological mobilization, so that the masses gradually realized that increasing fertilizer application is a powerful guarantee for further improving the unit area yield, and thus carried out a regular mass fertilizer accumulation movement.

(2) Conduct in-depth investigation and research to find local fertilizer sources. This approach is suitable for the current economic conditions of farmers and is easily accepted by the masses. Before land reform, farmers only used three kinds of fertilizer. In the past three years, according to the different natural conditions in various places, farmers have begun to adopt a variety of farmyard fertilizers. For example, farmers in Yangzhong Township in the Tenth District, in addition to using existing fertilizer pits, also selected ditch ends and places with sewage to build fertilizer pits, and collected fallen leaves and weeds from the mountains and poured them into the fertilizer pits to make fertilizer. Some farmers cut ferns, collect garbage, and collect fertile soil from roadsides and streets as compost. Jihou and other townships in the Third District accumulated fertilizer on the spot, adopting the method of "building fertilizer factories" by the fields, which not only exploited local fertilizer sources but also reduced the difficulty for the masses to carry fertilizer over long distances.

(3) Giving play to the leading role of the Party branch, relying on Party members, League members, township cadres, model workers, and active production elements, cultivating typical examples, establishing banners, organizing visits, and using key points to promote the general is an effective method to do a good job in fertilizer accumulation and application. For example, Wu Desheng, secretary of the Party branch of Yamu Township in the Eighth District, renovated the pigsty in 1952 and could accumulate seven dan of pig manure and one dan of dry fertilizer per month. After his successful experiment, he organized the masses to visit, promoting the renovation of 256 pigsties in the township. Later, the county leading organs also promoted his experience throughout the county. Furthermore, the method of accumulating fertilizer on the spot by building factories in the Third District and the method of digging kilns for fumigating fertilizer in the Eighth District have also been adopted by various places.

(4) Taking mutual aid and cooperative organizations as the foundation, carrying out a technical improvement movement for fertilizer accumulation and application. For example, the 82.3 mu of land in the Wu Desheng mutual aid group in Yamu Township, Eighth District, is divided into three types of soil, and different fertilization methods are adopted, resulting in increased production year after year. In 1951, the group harvested a total of 30,600 jin of grain, an average of 371 jin per mu. In 1952, the group harvested a total of 38,609 jin of grain, an average of 469 jin per mu, an increase of 26% compared with 1951. The rice grew even better in 1953.

(5) Promoting the combination of fertilizer accumulation work with improving environmental sanitation and improving livestock feeding management is a major method of opening up fertilizer sources and improving fertilizer quality. For example, Zhao Junquan, a model worker in the First District, stored livestock manure and improved the cowshed, placing the fertilizer in a place that is not ventilated and not subject to wind and rain; he also stored human manure in a manure pit and covered it to let it rot. Yangzhong Township in the Tenth District gave full play to the role of women and semi-laborers in improving environmental sanitation, digging out ditch fertilizer that had not been dug for decades, increasing the source of fertilizer. The masses generally said: It's not that there is no fertilizer to accumulate, but that there is no way to accumulate it. In improving environmental sanitation, most of the masses also achieved pigs in sties and chickens in cages, which not only paid attention to hygiene but also increased fertilizer and improved fertilizer quality.

III. Existing Problems

(1) Although our county has made great achievements in mobilizing farmers to accumulate and apply fertilizer in the past three years, the guidance on fertilizer accumulation and application in some villages is still insufficient, and it has failed to deeply and specifically help the masses explore fertilizer sources and improve fertilizer accumulation methods. Therefore, the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer for some farmers in agricultural production has not been resolved. The main reason is that some district and township cadres neglect the self-accumulation of farmyard fertilizer and lack necessary publicity and organizational work. For example, in a survey of five natural villages in Mayang Township, weeds more than one foot high grew around 64 houses, and the soil was black. If a patriotic sanitation movement is launched, each house can generally collect 20 dan of soil fertilizer, for a total of 1,280 dan. The weeds on the roadside can also be used as fertilizer, and you can also sweep up leaves near the mountain ridges and fields to accumulate fertilizer. If these fertilizers are used, the amount is very large. There are 461 households in the township, and only 100 households raise a total of 116 pigs. There are already pigsties for 78 pigs, and 38 pigs do not have pigsties. If livestock farming can be well developed, pig manure and urine can also be accumulated more than it is now. According to the survey, the township now applies an average of 7 or 8 dan of fertilizer per mu. As long as the method of accumulating soil fertilizer and sweeping leaves can be well promoted, the amount of fertilizer applied can be increased by more than double on the existing basis.

(2) The technical guidance on fertilizer accumulation and application is still insufficient, so there are still many unreasonable phenomena in fertilizer accumulation, application, and storage. Most farmers still use the old fertilizer accumulation methods, believing that every three dan of plant ash must be mixed with one dan of human urine. In the use of pig manure and cattle manure, there are still some who dry and burn it into ash for use, which reduces the quality of the fertilizer. The storage of fertilizer is also unreasonable. For example, in Mayang Township, more than half of the manure pens do not have doors, and the manure tanks are not covered, resulting in loss of fertility. From this point of view, we should strengthen scientific education in the future, overcome the conservative thinking of farmers, and strengthen the technical guidance of fertilizer accumulation, preservation, and application.

(3) There are still some bad fertilizer accumulation methods among the masses, which have caused some undue disasters. For example, some people in Yamu Township blindly went up the mountain to dig and scrape sod, turning the green mountains into red mountains, which easily caused flood disasters. In some remote natural villages, there is still the phenomenon of setting fire to mountains to accumulate fertilizer. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, there were 12 incidents of burning mountains in 8 townships in 3 districts due to fertilizer accumulation, burning down more than 10,000 mu of forests and 4,058 trees. This method of fertilizer accumulation should be educated and corrected to prevent forest fires and soil and water damage from continuing to occur.

IV. Future Methods

(1) Guidelines and Requirements: According to the characteristics of the current rural small-scale peasant economy and the local specific conditions, in order to ensure that there is sufficient fertilizer in agricultural production in 1954, it is necessary to adopt the policy of relying mainly on farmers' self-accumulation of fertilizer, supplemented by commercial fertilizer, and at the same time strengthen the implementation of rational fertilization. The specific requirements are: on the basis of fertilizer application in 1953, increase fertilizer by another 20% in 1954; in areas where base fertilizer is applied, gradually promote top dressing, and in areas where there is no habit of applying base fertilizer, gradually promote the application of base fertilizer. In terms of commercial fertilizer, it should be actively supplied according to the needs of the masses.

(2) Continue to implement production policy education, give play to the production enthusiasm of the masses, open up fertilizer sources, and promote rational fertilization. First of all, educate cadres and the masses to fully recognize that farmyard fertilizer is the basic fertilizer in agricultural production, which has significant effects on improving soil, cultivating land fertility, and increasing unit area yield. Therefore, we should make full use of existing fertilizer sources, and adopt methods that suit local conditions and obtain materials locally to exploit the potential of fertilizer. In the use of chemical fertilizers, cadres and the masses should be educated to fully recognize that chemical fertilizers are only a supplementary fertilizer. Excessive use of this fertilizer not only increases costs, but also easily causes soil compaction and reduces yields because this fertilizer lacks organic matter. Therefore, we should educate cadres to overcome the erroneous idea of simply relying on commercial fertilizer to increase production and neglecting to lead farmers to accumulate fertilizer.

(3) Strengthening technical guidance is the main method to fully exert the effectiveness of various fertilizers and increase fertilizer sources. First of all, we must use the method of summarizing experience and organizing forums, using concrete facts combined with scientific principles to educate cadres and the masses, overcome the shortcomings of only focusing on quantity and not paying attention to technical guidance in increasing fertilizer application, and let everyone know what soil type is suitable for what fertilizer, what crops are suitable for what fertilizer, what time is suitable for what fertilizer, which fertilizers can be mixed, and which fertilizers cannot be mixed.

(4) Relying on mutual aid and cooperation as the foundation, absorbing individual farmers and women and semi-laborers to participate, and launching short-term fertilizer accumulation competition movements in a timely manner under the principle of leading the masses to accumulate fertilizer regularly is an effective method to promote fertilizer accumulation. Appropriate commendations and rewards should be given to active fertilizer accumulators to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses in accumulating fertilizer.

(5) Party committees and rural Party branches at all levels should strengthen leadership over fertilizer accumulation and application work, and at the same time give play to the active role of technical personnel to promote this work. In addition, banks should provide loans in a timely manner, cooperatives should supply commercial fertilizers in a timely manner, and agricultural and forestry construction departments should actively cooperate to jointly solve various problems of the masses in fertilizer accumulation and application, mobilize farmers to increase fertilizer application and rationally fertilize, in order to increase the unit area yield of crops.

    福建省尤溪县历年来施肥情况的调查及对今后发动农民合理增施肥料的意见
    中共尤溪县委会
    为了有力地指导一九五四年的大生产运动，争取粮食的更大丰收，我们特抽调干部组成工作组，分别在能代表全县的几个区乡，调查和总结了三年来农民积肥施肥的情况、经验和存在的问题。今将调查结果介绍如下：
      一、基本情况
    在解放前的反动政府统治时代，这些地区每亩田平均施肥量不超过三担半。最高的是一区麻洋乡，平均每亩施肥洋田四担七，山田三担半；一般的如八区鸭墓乡，平均洋田每亩三担，山田两担半；最低的以一区和平乡为例，平均洋田每亩两担，山田施得更少，部分山垅远田甚至根本不施肥。肥料的种类一般只有三种，即草木灰、人粪和家畜肥。在合理施肥方面，除农民习惯使用的几种办法外，根本谈不上有什么改进。因此农业生产水平很低，并且在逐年下降。
    解放后四年来，在党和人民政府领导下，经过各种社会改革运动，尤其是实行了土地改革以后，农民分得了土地和各种生产资料，生产情绪非常高涨。各地积肥量和施肥量也逐年增加，并开辟了新的肥源。土地改革前只上人粪、草木灰和家畜肥三种，现在已增加了数种，并且各种肥料的质量都有不同程度的提高，尤其是一九五二年和一九五三年更加显著。根据在六区下桥乡黄清起互助组（一般组）内调查，全组耕地面积四十六亩六分四厘，解放以前平均每亩施肥六担；一九五二年每亩施肥十三担半，比解放前增加了一倍多；一九五三年平均每亩施肥二十担，又比一九五二年增加了约百分之五十。他们并根据不同土质施用不同的肥料。由于施肥量逐年增加，产量也随之提高。像八区鸭墓乡的耕地面积共二千零四十七亩五分六厘，抗日战争以前每年总产量八十万一千六百五十八斤，平均每亩三百九十一斤；解放前每年总产量六十七万二千三百五十九斤，平均每亩三百二十八斤；一九五一年产量六十九万七千四百八十六斤，平均每亩三百四十斤；一九五二年产量八十三万三千七百二十五斤，平均每亩四百零七斤；一九五二年比抗日战争以前增产百分之四，比解放前增产百分之二十四点六，比一九五一年增产百分之二十。一九五三年稻子长得比以往任何一年都好。这些增产成绩，是和增施肥料、改进施肥技术分不开的。
    同时，经过三年的施肥技术指导、银行贷款扶助、合作社的及时供应，使群众在用商品肥料上开始习惯起来，商品肥料的需要量逐年增加。全县一九五一年施用了肥田粉三万斤和硫铵八千斤，一九五二年施用了肥田粉九万五千多斤、硫铵两万多斤和牛骨粉两万五千多斤（私营工商业者出卖的不在内），一九五三年到九月为止已用了肥田粉十五万三千四百斤、硫铵三万二千三百斤和牛骨粉九千四百斤。农民普遍反映是：肥田粉好，见效快。
      二、几点经验
    （一）贯彻政策宣传，解除群众思想顾虑，发挥广大农民生产积极性，是开展群众性积肥的基础。我县在一九五零年冬和一九五一年春的土地改革中，大力宣传了土地改革的目的是为了发展生产，在土地改革后宣传贯彻了农业生产各项政策；许多干部都深入群众，了解当地耕作习惯和积肥施肥的情况，采用个别访问和召开老农座谈会相结合的办法，总结增产经验，充分进行思想动员，使群众逐渐体会到增施肥料是进一步提高单位面积产量的有力保证，从而开展了经常性的群众积肥运动。
    （二）深入调查研究，寻找当地肥源。这种做法，适合当前农民经济条件，群众容易接受。土地改革前农民只使用三种肥料，三年来根据各地不同的自然条件，农民们开始采用了多种多样的农家肥料。像十区洋中乡农民，除利用现有肥坑外，还选择沟尾和有污水的地方搞成肥坑，把山上的落叶和杂草收集起来，倒在肥坑里做肥料。有的农民割蕨草、扫集垃圾和街巷路旁的肥土等作堆肥。三区漈后等乡就地积肥，采取在田边“搭肥厂”的办法，这样既发掘了当地肥源，又减少了群众山高路远挑肥的困难。
    （三）发挥党支部领导作用，依靠党员、团员、乡干部、劳动模范和生产积极分子，培养典型，树立旗帜，组织参观，运用重点推动一般，是搞好积肥施肥的有效方法。像八区鸭墓乡党支部书记吴德升在一九五二年改造猪栏，每月能积七担猪粪、一担干肥。在他试验成功后，组织群众参观，推动全乡改造猪栏二百五十六个。后来，县领导机关又把他的经验在全县推广了。再如三区重点创造的就地搭厂积肥和八区的挖窑洞薰肥办法，也都被各地采用。
    （四）以互助合作组织为基础，开展积肥施肥的技术改进运动。像八区鸭墓乡吴德升互助组八十二亩三分田，共分三种土质，采用不同的施肥方法，结果年年增产。一九五一年该组共实收谷子三万零六百斤，平均每亩三百七十一斤；一九五二年实收谷子三万八千六百零九斤，平均每亩四百六十九斤，比一九五一年增产百分之二十六。一九五三年稻子长得更好。
      （五）推动积肥工作与改进环境卫生、改善牲畜饲养管理相结合，是开辟肥源和提高肥质的一个主要方法。像一区劳动模范赵俊铨，将牲畜肥料贮藏起来，并改良了牛栏，将肥料放在不通气、不受风雨侵袭的地方；并把人粪贮存在粪坑里，坑上加了盖，让它腐熟。十区洋中乡在改进环境卫生时，充分发挥妇女、半劳力的作用，挖出了几十年来未挖的沟肥，增加了肥源。群众普遍说：不是没有肥料积，而是没有想办法去积。在改进环境卫生时，大部分群众还做到了猪有圈、鸡有笼，这样既讲究了卫生，又增加了肥料和提高了肥质。
      三、存在的问题
      （一）虽然我县三年来发动农民积肥施肥有了很大成绩，但有部分乡村对积肥施肥的指导还不够，未能深入具体地帮助群众发掘肥源，改进积肥方法，因而部分农民在农业生产中肥料不足的困难，仍未得到解决。其原因主要是部分区乡干部忽视农家自积肥料，缺乏必要的宣传组织工作。如麻洋乡五个自然村调查，有六十四座房屋四周围的杂草长得有一尺多高，土质又黑，如开展一次爱国卫生运动，每座房屋四周围一般能搞二十担，共可积一千二百八十担土粪。路旁的杂草也可作为肥料，并且还可到山垅田附近去扫树叶来积肥，如把这些肥料运用起来，数量是很大的。全乡有四百六十一户，只有一百户共养一百十六只猪，现已有七十八只猪有猪栏，还有三十八只猪没有猪栏，如能很好发展家畜事业，猪粪尿也能比现在的积得多。根据调查，这个乡现在平均每亩施肥七、八担，只要能很好推广积土肥和扫树叶等积肥的办法，就可以在现有的基础上增加施肥量一倍以上。
      （二）对积肥施肥的技术指导还不够，所以在积肥施肥和保管肥料上还有许多不合理的现象。大部分农民仍然采用旧的积肥方法，认为每三担草木灰必须和一担人尿混合用；在使用猪粪肥牛粪肥上，还有晒干烧成灰使用的，降低了肥料的质量。在保管肥料上也不合理，像麻洋乡有一半以上的粪栏没有做门，粪缸没有加盖，走失了肥分。由此看来，今后应加强科学教育，克服农民的守旧思想，加强积肥、保肥、施肥的技术指导。
      （三）群众中还存在一些不好的积肥方法，因而引起某些不应有的灾害。像鸭墓乡有部分群众盲目上山挖刮草皮，使青山变为红山，这样就容易引起洪水灾害。有的偏僻的自然村仍有放火烧山积肥的现象，据不完全统计，去年有三个区的八个乡因积肥共发生烧山事件十二次，烧毁森林一万多亩、林木四千零五十八株。这种积肥方法，应教育群众纠正，以免森林火灾和破坏水土的事件继续发生。
      四、今后的办法
      （一）方针与要求：根据当前农村小农经济的特点和当地具体情况，为保证一九五四年农业生产中有足够的肥料，必须采取依靠农民自积肥料为主，商品肥料为辅，同时加强贯彻合理施肥的方针。具体要求是：在一九五三年施肥的基础上，一九五四年再增加肥料百分之二十；应做到施基肥的地区逐步推广施追肥，没有施基肥习惯的地区要逐步推行施基肥。在商品肥料上，应根据群众的要求，积极供应。
    （二）继续贯彻生产政策教育，发挥群众的生产积极性，开辟肥源，提倡合理施肥。首先教育干部和群众充分认识，农家自积肥料是农业生产中的基本肥料，它具有改良土壤、培养地力、提高单位面积产量的显著效能。因此，应充分利用现有肥源，采取因地制宜、就地取材的方法，发掘肥料的潜在力。在使用化学肥料方面，应教育干部和群众充分认识化学肥料只是一种辅助肥料。过多使用这种肥料不仅增加了成本，而且因为这种肥料缺乏有机质，容易使土壤板结，降低产量。因此，应教育干部克服单纯依靠商品肥料增产和忽视领导农民积肥的错误思想。
      （三）加强技术指导是充分发挥各种肥料的效能、增加肥源的主要方法。首先要用总结经验，组织座谈的方式，用具体事实结合科学道理，教育干部、群众，克服在增施肥料中只重数量不重视技术指导的缺点，让大家知道什么土质，施什么肥料合适，什么农作物施什么肥料合理，什么时期宜施什么肥料，那些肥料可以混合施用，那些肥料不能混合。
      （四）依靠互助合作为基础，吸收个体农民及妇女和半劳力参加，在领导群众经常积肥的原则下，适时地开展短期积肥竞赛运动，是推动积肥的有效办法。对积肥的积极分子给予适当的表扬和奖励，鼓舞群众的积肥积极性。
    （五）各级党委和农村党支部对积肥施肥工作应加强领导，同时发挥技术人员的积极作用，来推动这一工作。此外，银行要及时贷款，合作社及时供应商品肥料，农林建设部门积极配合，以共同解决群众在积肥施肥中的各种问题，动员农民增加施肥量和合理施肥，以提高农作物单位面积产量。
