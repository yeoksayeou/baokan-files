The General Line for the Transition Period of the State is Inspiring
    -- A Surge of Patriotic Grain Sales and Mutual Aid Cooperation in Xizhanggeng Township, Jiexian County
    Pei Lisheng, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government

    Editor's Note: This article was written by Pei Lisheng, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, after inspecting grain purchasing work in Xizhanggeng Township, Jiexian County, last December. From this article, we can see that after the publicity of the general line, Xizhanggeng Township quickly formed a climax of patriotic grain sales and mutual aid cooperation movement. The township is a cotton-producing area, but the whole township still sold 30,000 catties of grain; now nine mutual aid groups in the township have requested to be converted into agricultural production cooperatives, and another 120 households have applied to join the cooperatives, plus the original 40 households that participated in the agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for more than 38 percent of the total number of households in the township; the share capital of the township's credit cooperative was originally 697 shares, and now 200 new shares have been added. At the same time, the publicity of the general line has greatly increased the enthusiasm of farmers in production. Farmers throughout the township are investing in expanding production, buying livestock, adding farm tools, buying pigs and sheep, and engaging in sideline occupations with full vigor. Some party members who had negative emotions in the past are now mobilized; villages that were lagging behind in their work in the past are now also mobilized. In short, a socialist atmosphere fills the whole township, and everything is changing in the direction indicated by the general line.
    Since participating in the county's expanded three-level cadre meeting, cadres and activists in Xizhanggeng Township, Second District, Jiexian County, have been vigorously publicizing the general line of the state during the transition period throughout the township. They first convened township party committee meetings, meetings of all party members and Youth League members, meetings of all township people's representatives, and meetings of activists, where Comrade Lü Zhenlong, secretary of the township party branch, and Comrade Wang Zhicheng, the township head, conveyed the state's general line and the state's grain purchase plan. They also convened separate discussion meetings by residential groups for youth, women, and the elderly.

    After extensive publicity, the masses were extremely excited, their enthusiasm for work increased, and their confidence in taking the socialist road became even higher. Everyone agreed that with the general line, "minds are enlightened, and eyes are bright." The township has a total of 111 party members, Youth League members, and cadres, of which 29 were previously negative and weary in their work, fearing work delays and unwilling to attend meetings. After the education of the general line, 14 of them have become active in their work, and 15 have also made progress compared to before. Zhang Xiaogen, the militia captain of Xiazhanggeng, was not active in his work in the past and was unwilling to join a mutual aid group. After studying the general line, he recalled the situation of being exploited in the past and said: "I am a liberated household. My life has been better in the past few years, so I don't want to work hard anymore. Chairman Mao pointed out that we must go to a socialist society in a fairly long period of time. I am a communist party member. If I don't take the socialist road, where am I going? I will make up my mind to do a good job in the agricultural production cooperative in the future, take the road of Xizhanggeng, and resolutely not take the old road of capitalism." Geng Zhongyuan, the civil affairs commissioner of Dongzhanggeng, used to take a perfunctory attitude towards his work and wanted to put his surplus grain out to make a profit. After listening to the report, he excitedly said: "My family used to be large and empty. If it weren't for the Communist Party to lead us, could we have a good life? Now the life is not good enough. In order to have a better life and realize industrialization, I will sell my surplus grain to the state." He volunteered to sell 450 catties of surplus grain at the county's expanded cadre meeting. After returning and holding a family meeting, he increased it to 1,660 catties.

    The township has a total of 2,780 people, and 1,627 people participated in the study of the general line, accounting for 58 percent of the township's population; 132 households in the township rarely participated in political activities in the past. After the education of the general line, 83 households have raised their awareness, accounting for more than 62 percent of the original backward households. After the cadres and the masses were educated by the general line, they actively sold grain to the state. Although the township is a major cotton-producing area, 125 farmers sold 30,000 catties of grain. At the same time, they actively participated in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement. Now all nine mutual aid groups (83 households) in the township have requested to be converted into cooperatives, and another 120 households have also applied to join the cooperatives, plus the original 40 households that participated in the cooperatives, accounting for more than 38 percent of the total number of 632 households in the township.

    The township plans to develop the four branch cooperatives of Xiazhanggeng, Longju, Macun, and Dongzhanggeng under its jurisdiction, and establish a joint cooperative based on the Xizhanggeng cooperative. On the basis of the general improvement of the masses' awareness, the rural credit cooperative has also greatly developed. The total share capital of the cooperative was originally 697 shares, and now 200 new shares have been developed. The members' deposits reached 120 million yuan, including 84 million yuan from selling cotton and 19.182 million yuan from selling grain (almost all of the grain sales proceeds were deposited into the credit cooperative). Farmers throughout the township are actively investing in expanding production. Now the credit cooperative has issued a total of 40 million yuan in loans, and borrowed another 14.44 million yuan from the bank. In addition to their own investment, they have bought back 20 livestock and 5 carts. Another 11 cattle were bought from Henan. Xizhanggeng Village No. 1 alone bought back 9 livestock. According to statistics from Xizhanggeng Village No. 1 alone, sideline investment has bought back 70 pigs and 100 sheep from Gansu. Under the encouragement of the general line, the masses' enthusiasm for production is extremely high.

    In the process of studying the general line, through comparative education, the entire farmers of Xizhanggeng Township received a profound socialist education, which further enhanced their socialist consciousness. They first recalled the benefits brought to farmers by the restoration and development of industry in recent years. There were a total of nine waterwheels in Xizhanggeng Township before liberation, and now it has developed to 231. Among them, Xiazhanggeng Village had 23 mu of irrigated land before liberation, and now it has 484 mu. Xizhanggeng originally had no irrigated land, and now it has developed to 400 mu. The original dry cotton fields could only produce 12,000 catties of lint cotton, but after being converted into irrigated land, it increased to 48,000 catties. Wang Yonglu, a member of the agricultural production cooperative in the village, originally had 8 mu of dry cotton fields, with a yield of 30 catties of lint cotton per mu. In 1950, he borrowed a waterwheel. In the past four years, the yield per mu has increased from 30 catties to 120 catties, and the total output has increased to 960 catties, an increase of 1,952 catties of cotton, worth 14.64 million yuan. The original price of a waterwheel was 1,894,200 yuan. After deducting the waterwheel loan from the increased production, there was still 12,745,800 yuan left, which was used to buy a horse for 1.8 million yuan, and another 5 million yuan was planned to buy a good mule. The township bought a total of 73 new-style plowshares, and the land plowed with plowshares was all harvested. Zhao Wenhan of Macun Village said: "Last year's 80 mu of wheat fields in our village were all plowed with plowshares. This year, the average yield per mu was more than 230 catties, which is more than 100 catties more than the land that was not plowed with plowshares." Yang Shijun, deputy director of the Xizhanggeng Agricultural Cooperative, said: "This year, aphids were found on the land of our cooperative, and they were extinguished by spraying pesticides. Originally, the cotton bolls did not grow well. We bought 3,000 catties of fertilizer powder and applied top dressing, and the cotton bolls also changed color." After accounting, they deeply realized that industrialization is the greatest interest of farmers. Wang Fengxian of Dongzhanggeng said: "Without industrial support, how could my cotton have a bumper harvest, how could I wear rain boots and get a flashlight, and how could I live a socialist life in the future."

    Secondly, they proceeded from the actual situation of the agricultural production cooperatives in their own villages to confirm the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation, and to confirm that it is the only way to guide all farmers to become rich. According to the statistics of 40 households participating in the agricultural production cooperative in Xizhanggeng, before the establishment of the cooperative (1952), the net agricultural income calculated in wheat was 166,380 catties, and the net sideline income was 2,101 catties, with a total income of 168,481 catties. After the establishment of the cooperative (1953), the net agricultural income was 244,166 catties, and the net sideline income was 7,367 catties, with a total income of 251,533 catties, an increase of 49.3 percent compared to before the establishment of the cooperative. This year, each male laborer usually does 150 workdays, and each female laborer usually does 60 workdays, with a dividend of 19,633 yuan for each workday. Comparing this year's autumn harvest with last year's full harvest, 38 out of 40 households in the cooperative exceeded, and even exceeded by one or two times, not counting the harvest from private plots. The bumper harvest of agricultural production cooperatives proves that only by organizing and running cooperatives can agricultural production increase. Xizhanggeng educated the masses with vivid real people and real events. Wang Haoshou, a member of the cooperative, earned 4,477,600 yuan last year. After joining the cooperative this year, he earned 10,957,300 yuan in autumn. This year's autumn harvest exceeded last year's full harvest by 6,479,700 yuan. He paid off his old debts of 1.9 million yuan, bought a big cow, and plans to buy a mule for 5 million yuan. Zhang Pianpian quit the cooperative halfway this year. He harvested three stones of corn, 800 catties of sweet potatoes, and worked short-term jobs for two months, earning a total of 1 million yuan. After deducting expenses, there is no food left at home. If he was in the cooperative, two laborers could do 300 workdays and earn 6 million yuan, resulting in a loss of 5 million yuan. Through these two vivid examples, discussions were launched throughout the township. Zhang Pianpian firmly stated at the meeting: "I am determined to join the cooperative again." Geng Zhongyuan of Dongzhanggeng said: "Wang Haoshou's road is the road to socialism." Wang Fuquan of Macun said: "I used to work as a long-term worker for landlords, lived in temples, and begged for food. I was exploited by usurious loans. In the future, I will resolutely demand to join the agricultural cooperative and never take Zhang Pianpian's road." Widowed and lonely households also saw that joining mutual aid and cooperation is the only way out. The old man Xue Zhankui saw that the agricultural cooperative could really harvest more crops and asked to join the agricultural cooperative. The 70-year-old Wang Hualan said: "If you ask me to join the cooperative, I will sell grain and put the land into the cooperative, so that I can harvest more. Don't let me waste the land in vain and not harvest any grain." Yan Jinfeng, a military dependent, said: "I am relieved to put my 15 mu of land into the cooperative." The fact that the agricultural cooperative had a bumper harvest made many old middle peasants and people who were skeptical and distrustful of the agricultural cooperative believe it. Cai Gaosheng (former middle peasant) of Longju Village, whom the masses called the "leader of the eight major leverages," did not believe that organizing could lead to a bumper harvest in the past and said: "It's called people to beat me when I join the cooperative." He was also afraid of difficulties in supplying grain if he sold it, "It's not as stable to have it in your left hand as it is to have it in your right hand." After the education of the general line and the inspiration of the bumper harvest facts of the Xizhanggeng cooperative, he also sold 200 catties of mung beans. Wang Dongsheng used to say: "If I say it's good, it's good, if I say it's bad, it's bad." This time, he also convincingly said: "The Communist Party does what it says, and Chairman Mao's words are never in vain." After his ideological awareness was improved, he helped cadres mobilize three households to sell 800 catties of wheat. Wang Zijing's father of Xizhanggeng used to say: "The brothers will still separate, the cooperative is still okay, don't listen to them, I guarantee it won't work." Now when he sees people, he says: "Look at your village's individual farming and mutual aid groups, how can they compare to the production cooperative in our village." The old man Wang Menghe used to say when mobilizing to join the cooperative: "My head can't be broken open even with a steel axe." After accounting this time, he sold three stones of grain to the state and also asked to join the cooperative. He said: "I only had seven mu of land in the past, but now I have 25 mu of good land. Isn't it because of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that our life has been better in the past few years? It's right to follow the Communist Party."

    The bumper harvest of the Xizhanggeng agricultural production cooperative has brought about significant changes in the lives of the cooperative members. In terms of purchasing cloth, ordinary households averaged 100,000 to 130,000 yuan per person, buying 25 to 32 feet or more. Ordinary households averaged more than one towel per person, and ordinary households averaged 1.2 to 1.7 pairs of socks per person. Ordinary households averaged 1.2 to 1.5 catties of sugar per person. Yao Fenglan, deputy director of the agricultural cooperative, said: "After our village's agricultural cooperative had a bumper harvest, there are many more wealthy people. Almost all women wear woolen clothes and rain boots, and buy 260 zhang of various cloths, spending 10 million yuan. At the Nanmiao Fair, each family gave women 50,000 yuan to buy things at the fair. With the production cooperative, families are also more harmonious. Wang Heping and his wife in our village used to fight frequently. Now they work during the day and are not together, so they don't bother to get angry. When they meet at night, they feel even more affectionate. Women go to the fields to work, and their social status has also improved. Mothers-in-law see that their daughters-in-law can work and get dividends, and they also care about their daughters-in-law. In the past, there was little food and clothing, and families were not harmonious. Now they are also harmonious."

    Thirdly, the farmers of Xizhanggeng Township realized from their own personal experience that to implement the general line, it is necessary to do a good job in purchasing grain. Otherwise, the spontaneous trend of capitalism will develop, and capitalism will occupy the rural front. Lu Hanying of Dongzhanggeng said: "I had difficulties in my life last year. I borrowed three stones of grain from others, and one stone earned four dou of interest. This year, I paid back two stones to others, and I still owe 2.2 stones. I want to give them money, but they have to have grain. If the state does not control the grain, they will rely on the grain to earn 'dou heads' and exploit the poor. One family in our village harvested 13-14 stones of grain. After the wheat harvest, they withdrew from the mutual aid group because they were afraid of mutual borrowing and lending within the mutual aid group and suffering themselves. Some people withdraw from mutual aid groups and cooperatives as soon as they have a way out, develop freely, and want to have a 'son' when they have grain and money. This will not consolidate mutual aid and cooperation and will take the road of capitalism." Li Zhizhong, secretary of the Longju Village branch, said: "If the state does not control the grain, and all the grain is hoarded at home by grain speculators such as Li Ziwei and Zhang Anxing, we will not even be able to eat the bones in a few years. One family gets rich, and the masses suffer." Zhao Wenhan of Macun Village said: "Before liberation, I borrowed 20 stones of grain from others, and one stone tripled in three years, which turned into nine stones. If they hoard grain, we will starve. Grain prices used to fluctuate frequently, but the People's Government controlled the grain prices. Last year, one catty of wheat was more than 1,000 yuan, and it still is now." Zhang Qicheng, deputy secretary of the Xizhanggeng Township branch, said: "The state's purchase of grain can guarantee the supply to households in difficulty. Last year, our grain harvest was poor, and the state transferred rice and wheat from Hubei and Hunan to support us. Otherwise, we would have suffered from usurious loans." Many people compared their lives before and after liberation. Zhang Jianlin of Xizhanggeng volunteered to sell three stones of grain after listening to the general line report. His wife disagreed. He said: "Isn't this house and land only divided during the land reform? Without the leadership of the Communist Party, we would still be living a life of eating chaff and wild vegetables." Lü Juhua, Wang Zixiu's mother, used to refuse to attend meetings. This time, she recalled the oppression she suffered from the Yan bandits and Japanese imperialism and recalled that the bandits robbed her family's grain. She also became aware. Her son volunteered to sell 300 catties of grain. She said: "Our family also has a jar of wheat hidden. Let's sell it to the state." A total of 500 catties were sold before and after.

    After the general line education, the enthusiasm of all farmers in the township was greatly encouraged. The masses throughout the township realized that "We can live a happy life after liberation because we rely on the leadership of the Communist Party. If it weren't for Chairman Mao calling on us to organize, the leadership of the Communist Party and the support of the state, we would not have a bumper harvest. In the future, we must respond to the call of the Party and the government and advance under the guidance of the general line."

    国家过渡时期的总路线振奋人心
    ——解县西张耿乡掀起爱国售粮和互助合作的热潮
    山西省人民政府主席　裴丽生
    编者按：去年十二月山西省人民政府主席裴丽生到解县西张耿乡检查购粮工作后，写了这篇文章。从这篇文章中可以看出西张耿乡经过总路线的宣传很快地形成了爱国售粮和互助合作运动的高潮。该乡是产棉区，但全乡还卖粮食三万斤；现在全乡有九个互助组要求转为农业生产合作社，另外还有一百二十户要求入社，加上原来参加了农业生产合作社的四十户，共占全乡总户数的百分之三十八强；该乡信贷社的股金原为六百九十七股，现在又新增加了二百股。同时总路线的宣传，使农民的生产积极性大大提高，全乡农民投资扩大生产，买牲口，添农具，买猪羊，搞副业，劲头十足。过去党员中有消极情绪的人，现在动起来了；过去工作落后的村现在也动起来了。总之，社会主义空气充满着全乡，一切都在依照总路线所指示方向变化着。
    解县二区西张耿乡干部、积极分子自参加全县三级扩大干部会议以后，就在全乡大张旗鼓地宣传国家过渡时期的总路线。他们首先召开了乡支委会议、全体党员团员会议、全乡人民代表会议和积极分子会议，由乡支部书记吕振龙同志和乡长王至诚同志传达了国家的总路线和国家收购粮食的计划，又按居民小组并分别召集青年、妇女、老人进行座谈讨论。
    经过广泛宣传以后，群众情绪极为兴奋，工作劲头大了，走社会主义道路的信心也更加高涨了。大家一致认为，有了总路线“脑筋开窍了，心眼也亮了”。该乡共有党员、团员、干部一百一十一个，其中有二十九个过去工作上消极疲沓，怕误工，不愿参加开会，经过总路线教育以后，已有十四个工作积极起来了，有十五个也比以前进步了。下张耿民兵队长张小根过去工作不积极，又不愿参加互助组，这次学习了总路线，回忆了过去受剥削的情形，他说：“咱是个翻身户，这几年来光景过得好了，就不愿干啦。毛主席指点说：在相当长的时期内要到社会主义社会，咱是个共产党员，不走社会主义的路，到那里去呀？我今后要下定决心搞好农业生产合作社，走西张耿的道路，坚决不走资本主义的老路。”东张耿民政委员耿忠元过去对工作抱着应付态度，想把自己的余粮放出去，翻上几翻；这次听了报告后兴奋地说：“咱过去的家大、底空，如果不是共产党来领导咱们，还能过上好光景吗？现在生活过得还不算好，为了过更好光景，实现工业化，我要把余粮卖给国家。”他在县扩大干部会议上自报出卖余粮四百五十斤，回去开好了家庭会议，又增加到一千六百六十斤。
    该乡共有二千七百八十人，参加总路线学习的有一千六百二十七人，占全乡人口的百分之五十八；全乡过去很少参加政治活动的有一百三十二户，经过总路线教育提高觉悟的有八十三户，占原有落后户的百分之六十二强。干部和群众经过总路线教育以后，便踊跃向国家出卖粮食。该乡虽为主要产棉区，也有一百二十五户农民，出卖粮食三万斤。同时积极参加了农业生产互助合作运动，现在全乡有九个互助组（八十三户）全部要求转社，另外还有一百二十户也要求入社，加上原有参加社的四十户，占全乡总户数六百三十二户的百分之三十八强。
    该乡计划发展所属下张耿、龙居、麻村、东张耿四个分社，以西张耿社为基础成立联社。在群众觉悟普遍提高的基础上，也使农村信贷社大为发展，全社股金原为六百九十七股，现在又新发展了二百股，社员存款达一亿二千万元，其中卖棉花存款八千四百万元，卖粮食存款一千九百一十八万二千元（售粮款几乎全部存入信贷社）。全乡农民积极投资扩大生产，现在信贷社共放出贷款四千万元，又从银行贷款一千四百四十万元，再加上自己投资，已买回牲口二十头，大车五辆，另外又去河南买牛十一头。其中西张耿一村即买回牲口九头。副业投资仅西张耿一村统计，已买回猪七十只，又去甘肃买羊一百只。在总路线的鼓舞下，群众的生产劲头极为高涨。
    在学习总路线的过程中，通过算账对比教育，使西张耿乡全体农民受了一次深刻的社会主义教育，进一步提高了社会主义的觉悟。他们首先回忆了这几年以来工业恢复发展给农民带来的好处。西张耿乡解放以前共有九辆水车，现在发展到二百三十一辆，其中下张耿村解放前有水地二十三亩，现在有四百八十四亩，西张耿原来没有水地，现在发展到四百亩，原来旱棉田只能产皮棉一万二千斤，改为水地后增加到四万八千斤。该村农业生产合作社社员王永禄原有旱棉田八亩，每亩产皮棉三十斤，一九五○年贷水车一辆，四年以来每亩产量由三十斤上升到一百二十斤，总产量上升到九百六十斤，共增产棉花一千九百五十二斤，折人民币一千四百六十四万元。原贷水车一辆价一百八十九万四千二百元，增产所得除归还水车贷款外，还剩一千二百七十四万五千八百元，买马一匹花一百八十万元，还计划用五百万元买好骡子一头。全乡共买新式步犁七十三部，使用步犁犁过的地，都得到了丰收。麻村赵文汉同志说：“我村去年的八十亩麦田，都用步犁犁过，今年每亩平均产二百三十多斤，比没有使步犁犁过的地多产一百多斤。”西张耿农业社副社长杨世俊说：“今年咱们合作社的土地发现了蚜虫，喷上杀虫药剂才扑灭了。原来棉桃长得不好，买了三千斤肥田粉，施了追肥，棉桃也变色了。”经过算账，他们深刻认识到工业化才是农民的最大利益。东张耿王凤先说：“不是工业支援，我的棉花那能丰产，那能穿上雨鞋拿上手电，将来那能过社会主义生活。”
    其次，他们从本村农业生产合作社的实际情况出发，证实了互助合作的优越性，证实了它是引导全体农民走向富裕的唯一道路。据西张耿参加农业生产合作社的四十户统计，建社以前（一九五二年），农业纯收入以小麦计算为十六万六千三百八十斤，副业纯收入为二千一百零一斤，两项共收入十六万八千四百八十一斤。建社以后（一九五三年），农业纯收入为二十四万四千一百六十六斤，副业纯收入为七千三百六十七斤，两项收入共为二十五万一千五百三十三斤，比建社前增加收入百分之四十九点三。今年每个男劳力普通做一百五十个劳动日，女劳动力普通做六十个劳动日，每个劳动日分红一万九千六百三十三元。拿今年秋季作物收获和去年全年收获比较，全社四十户就有三十八户超过，甚至超过一倍、两倍，还不把自留地收获计算在内。农业生产合作社的丰产，证明了只有组织起来，办合作社，才能使农业增产。西张耿用生动的活人活事教育了群众。社员王好受去年收入四百四十七万七千六百元，今年加入合作社以后，秋季收入一千零九十五万七千三百元，今年秋季比去年全年超收六百四十七万九千七百元，还了旧欠一百九十万，买了一条大牛，还要买骡。张偏偏今年半途退社，秋季收了三石玉茭，八百斤红薯，打了两个月短工，共收入一百万元，除负担外现在家里已没有吃的。如果在社里，两个劳力可做三百个劳动日，即可收入六百万元，结果少收入了五百万。通过这两个活生生的例子，在全乡展开了讨论，张偏偏在会上坚决表示：“我决心再参加合作社。”东张耿耿忠元说：“王好受的道路就是社会主义的道路。”麻村王福泉说：“我过去给地主扛长工，住家庙，要饭吃，受高利贷剥削，今后坚决要求参加农业社，决不走张偏偏的道路。”鳏寡孤独户也看见只有参加互助合作才是出路。薛占魁老汉看见农业社真能多收庄稼，要求参加农业社。七十岁的王花兰老婆婆说：“叫我入社，我就粜粮，把地入了社，也能多收，不要让我白糟踏地，打不下粮食。”军属阎锦凤老婆婆说：“把我的十五亩地入了社，就放心了。”农业社丰产的事实，使许多老中农和对农业社采取怀疑和不相信的人相信了。龙居村蔡高升（旧中农），群众称他是“八大杠”的“杠头”，过去不相信组织起来能够丰产，并说：“我入社才叫人家摆打我哩。”把粮食卖了也怕供应时着难，“左手没有右手拿着稳”，经过总路线的教育和西张耿社丰产事实的启发，也卖出绿豆二百斤。王东升过去常说：“我说好，就是好，我说不好，就是不好。”这次也信服地说：“共产党说到那做到那，毛主席的话一句也不白说。”他的思想觉悟提高以后，就帮助干部动员了三户，卖出小麦八百斤。西张耿王子敬的父亲过去说：“弟兄们还要分家，合作社还行，不要听他们说，保险弄不成。”现在见了人就说：“看你们村的单干、互助组，那能抵住我村的生产合作社。”王梦和老汉过去在动员入社时说：“我这脑袋就是用钢斧破都破不开。”这次经过算账以后，卖给了国家三石粮食，还要求入社，他说：“我过去只有七亩地，现在有二十五亩好地，这几年来光景过好了，还不是毛主席和共产党给咱的，跟上共产党走没错。”
    西张耿农业生产社的丰产，使社员生活发生了显著的变化。在购买布匹方面，一般户每人平均十万至十三万元，买二十五尺至三十二尺多，毛巾一般户每人平均一条多，袜子一般户每人平均一点二至一点七双，食糖一般户每人平均一点二斤至一点五斤。农业社副社长姚凤蓝说：“我村农业社丰产以后，生活富裕的多了。妇女差不多都穿毛衣、雨鞋，买各种布二百六十丈，花一千万元。在南庙会上，每家给妇女发了五万元钱，让到会上买东西。有了生产社，家庭也和睦起来了，我村王和平夫妇，过去经常打架，现在白天做活不在一块，也顾不上生气，晚上见了面，觉得更亲切了。妇女上地劳动，社会地位也提高了，婆婆看到媳妇能劳动能分红，也特别关心媳妇，过去少吃缺穿，家庭不和，现在也和睦了。”
    再次，西张耿乡的农民从自己的切身经验中体会到：要贯彻总路线，就必须做好收购粮食工作，不如此，资本主义的自发趋势就会发展，资本主义就会占领农村阵地。东张耿卢汉英说：“我去年生活困难，向人家借了三石粮食，一石就出四斗利息，今年还了人家两石，还缺二石二，想给人家钱，人家非要粮食不可。国家不掌握粮食，他们就会靠粮食赚‘斗头’，剥削穷人。我村有一家打了十三四石粮，麦收以后，退出了互助组，怕在互助组内互借互贷，自己受累。有些人一有办法，就退出了互助组、合作社，自由发展，有了粮有了钱，就想生个‘儿子’，这样就不能巩固互助合作，就要走资本主义的道路。”龙居村分支部书记李志忠说：
  “如果国家不掌握粮食，都让粮食投机商李子威、张安兴那伙人把粮食囤在家里，再过几年，连骨头也吃不上啦。一家发财，害了群众。”麻村赵文汉说：“解放前贷了人家二十石粮食，人家一石翻三年就翻了九石，如果他们囤起粮食，我们就要饿肚。过去粮价经常变动，可是人民政府掌握了粮价，去年一斤麦是一千多元，现在还是。”西张耿乡副支部书记张起成说：“国家收购粮食，才能保证困难户的供应，去年咱这里粮食歉收，国家从湖北、湖南调来了大米小麦支援，不然，我们就要受高利贷的剥削。”许多群众都对比了自己解放前后的生活。西张耿张建林听了总路线报告后，自报卖粮三石，他老婆不同意，他说：“咱这房地还不是土地改革时才分的，没有共产党领导，还会过吃糠咽菜的生活。”王子秀妈吕菊花过去不肯参加开会，这次回忆到过去受阎匪和日本帝国主义的压迫，回忆到匪军抢她家的粮，也觉悟了，他儿子自报卖粮三百斤，她说：“我家还藏着一瓮麦子，也卖给国家吧。”前后共卖了五百斤。
    经过总路线教育后，大大鼓舞了该乡全体农民的情绪，全乡群众都体会到：“解放以后，我们能够过幸福生活，都是依靠了共产党的领导，要不是毛主席号召我们组织起来，共产党的领导和国家的支援，就不会丰收，今后一定要响应党和政府的号召，在总路线的照耀下前进。”
