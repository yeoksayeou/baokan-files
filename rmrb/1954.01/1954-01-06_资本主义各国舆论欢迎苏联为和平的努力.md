(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th) Reports from TASS Moscow: The reply of G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to questions raised by Kingsbury Smith, European Director of the International News Service of the United States, has attracted attention from public opinion in the capitalist world. Newspapers and radio stations in various countries have widely commented on this conversation. Many newspaper and radio observers acknowledge that Malenkov's remarks have been well-received in all circles.

	The American newspaper "Daily Mirror" wrote, "In the words of diplomats, Malenkov's New Year greetings to the American people are very sincere." The Sunday "New York Times" stated that Malenkov's response echoed his "peace proposals" of March 1953. However, some American bourgeois newspapers are trying to dilute the impression that Malenkov's response has made on the broad American people. In Canada and Argentina, many newspapers have commented on this document. Argentina's "La Prensa" pointed out that among the official New Year greetings published in the world, Malenkov's remarks are attractive both in content and form. It has shown great sincerity from the very beginning of the response.

	The French "l'Humanité" reflects the thoughts and desires of millions of peace-loving people in France. Commenting on Malenkov's reply, the newspaper said: "The Soviet Union has once again effectively promoted the cause of defending peace, opening up prospects for consultation on New Year's Day, which can be started under very favorable conditions if we do not relax any opportunity to contribute to the success of such consultations."

	Italy's "Avanti!" believes that Malenkov's remarks are new proof that the Soviet Union desires peace and points out concrete ways to ease international tensions for the people of the world. "l'Unità" published an article which specifically pointed out: "Malenkov's words about the possibility of improving the current relations between the people of the Soviet Union and the United States have undoubtedly received a profound response among the broad masses of people in various countries, who understand how important this is for the peaceful future of all mankind."

	According to Agence France-Presse, Britain welcomes Malenkov's reply, considering it a sincere expression to the Western world. Many newspapers in London published the full text of Malenkov's reply on the front page, calling it a "message of peace." The "Daily Telegraph" commented: All indications suggest that, if not elsewhere, at least in Europe there is a temporary hope of easing tensions.

	The West German "Hamburger Morgenpost" said that Malenkov's reply is a "good omen." The newspaper expressed its hope that the new year could be "a year of atomic peace." The "Bremer Nachrichten" published the full text of Malenkov's answers to reporters' questions on the front page under the title "Possibility of Easing Tensions." Another newspaper in Bremen, "Weser-Kurier," printed Malenkov's remarks on favorable conditions for further easing international tensions in 1954 in large type.

	Newspapers in Austria, Belgium, Greece, Switzerland, and other countries have published Malenkov's answers to reporters' questions in prominent positions and have published comments one after another. Austria's "Wiener Zeitung" regards G.M. Malenkov's answers to reporters' questions as "a good start to 1954 and a favorable prelude to the Berlin Conference."

	Many newspapers in India published Malenkov's reply. These newspapers all agreed with G.M. Malenkov's reply, considering it a further expression of the Soviet Union's desire to ease international tensions. The "Hindustan Times" published G.M. Malenkov's reply under the title: "Broader Prospects for Easing International Tensions," "Malenkov Says Soviet Union Desires Peace," "Call for a Ban on Atomic Weapons."

    资本主义各国舆论欢迎苏联为和平的努力
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫对美国国际新闻社欧洲分社社长金·史密斯所提问题的答复，引起了资本主义世界舆论的注意。各国报纸和电台都广泛地评论这篇谈话。许多报纸和电台的观察家承认，马林科夫的谈话在各界人士中得到良好的反应。
    美国报纸“每日镜报”写道，“用外交人士的话来说，马林科夫对美国人民的新年祝贺语气非常诚恳。”星期日的“纽约时报”说，马林科夫的回答是和他在一九五三年三月间“关于和平的主张”互相呼应的。还有一部分美国资产阶级报纸，却竭力要冲淡马林科夫的答复在广大的美国人民中所造成的印象。在加拿大和阿根廷，许多报纸都就这一文件发表了评论。阿根廷的“评论报”指出，在世界上发表的官方新年祝词中，马林科夫的谈话无论在内容上或是在形式上都吸引人注意。从答复一开始就表现得非常诚恳。
    法国“人道报”反映了法国千百万爱好和平的人民的思想和愿望。该报就马林科夫的答复评论说：“苏联再一次有效地推进了保卫和平的事业，在新年元旦打开了协商的远景，如果我们不放松任何促成这种协商的成功的机会的话，那么它是可以在非常有利的条件下开始的。”
    意大利的“前进报”认为马林科夫的谈话是新的证明，证明苏联愿望和平并为全世界人民指出缓和国际紧张局势的具体道路。“团结报”刊载了一篇文章，其中特别指出：“马林科夫所谈到的改善目前苏联和美国两国人民之间关系的可能性的一些话，毫无疑问，在世界各国广大的人民群众中间得到深刻的反应，他们明白，这对全人类的和平的将来是多么的重要。”
    据法新社报道，英国欢迎马林科夫的答复，认为这是对西方世界的诚意的表示。伦敦许多报纸都在第一版全文刊载马林科夫的答复，把它称为“和平音信”。“每日电讯报”评论说：有一切迹象表明，如果说不是在其他地方的话，那么至少说在欧洲是有了缓和紧张局势的暂时希望。
    西德的“汉堡晨邮报”说：马林科夫的答复是一个“吉兆”。该报表示希望新的一年能成为“原子和平的一年”。“不来梅新闻”在“缓和紧张局势的可能性”的标题下首页刊载了马林科夫答记者问的全文。不来梅的另一家报纸“威悉快报”以大号铅字排印了马林科夫关于在一九五四年内使国际紧张局势进一步缓和的有利条件的谈话。
    奥地利、比利时、希腊、瑞士等国的报纸都以显著地位刊载了马林科夫答记者问，并纷纷发表评论。奥地利的“维也纳日报”把格·马·马林科夫的答记者问看成是“一九五四年的良好的开端和柏林会议的有利前奏”。
    印度许多报纸刊载了马林科夫的答复。这些报纸都赞同格·马·马林科夫的答复，认为它是苏联愿望缓和国际紧张局势的进一步的表示。“印度斯坦时报”刊载格·马·马林科夫答复的标题是：“缓和国际紧张局势的更广阔的前景”、“马林科夫说苏联愿望和平”、“号召禁止原子武器的号召”。
