    Mutual Aid Teams are an Important Foundation of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
    Of the more than 110 million farm households in our country, over 47.9 million have already joined various agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations, including more than 273,000 who have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives. This shows that among the existing mutual aid and cooperative organizations, mutual aid teams are still the most common and widespread; and among all farmers, more than half are still individual farmers. With the efforts of 1954, the number of farm households participating in various mutual aid and cooperative organizations may reach and exceed 50 percent of the total number of farm households in the country, but the proportion of farm households participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives in the number of households already organized is still very small. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, in many areas, mutual aid teams will still be an important form of agricultural production. Every comrade working in rural areas must pay attention to this situation and must not relax their leadership over mutual aid teams in the slightest.
    Although mutual aid teams are a primary form of rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, they are the easiest form of organization for farmers to accept because their organization is relatively simple, and they can help farmers overcome some difficulties that are difficult to overcome when working individually, reduce class differentiation among farmers, and also increase production. Through mutual aid teams, farmers can initially develop the habit of collective labor, gain personal experience in collective production, and cultivate a group of leading cadres of mutual aid and cooperation among the masses, which makes it easier to promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement to a higher form - agricultural producers' cooperatives. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in the resolution on the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives that "the development of mutual aid teams is an important foundation for the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives"; and requires that while paying attention to strengthening the leadership of the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, we should also strengthen the leadership of the development of various forms of mutual aid teams. Therefore, in rural areas, in leading agricultural production work, mutual aid teams should be developed in large numbers, and it is also possible to develop mutual aid teams in large numbers.
    Generally speaking, rural work cadres in various places now recognize the importance of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and most cadres and some of the masses are very enthusiastic about running cooperatives, which is a very good phenomenon. If many agricultural producers' cooperatives are run well, the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement can be advanced a big step forward, which is foreseeable. However, it should also be pointed out that some local cadres have developed the view of underestimating mutual aid teams. For example, in propaganda work, they only pay attention to publicizing agricultural producers' cooperatives, but not mutual aid teams, and only publicize the benefits of running cooperatives, but not the conditions for running cooperatives. This creates a misconception among the masses that mutual aid teams are no longer needed or are not important, and that only cooperatives are good and must be joined. In some places, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists in mutual aid teams are all concentrated to run cooperatives, which invisibly collapses and disintegrates many mutual aid teams; some places do not pay attention to studying and solving the problems existing in mutual aid teams, thinking that it is too troublesome and difficult to solve, and that running cooperatives will naturally solve them; some places do not pay attention to developing new mutual aid teams, improving temporary mutual aid teams, and using and transforming the inherent forms of mutual aid among the masses, thinking that running cooperatives well will naturally lead to the great development of mutual aid teams; in addition, some cadres proceed from personal emotions and think that leading mutual aid teams is not as "interesting" as leading cooperatives, so they are not enthusiastic enough about leading mutual aid teams; some active elements among the masses also think that running mutual aid teams is not as glorious as running cooperatives, and they are somewhat "discouraged" when the conditions are not sufficient to transfer to cooperatives. All these situations are not good, will deviate from the realistic requirements of the vast majority of the masses, and will weaken the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement, which is not conducive to the development and improvement of agricultural production.
    Concentrating the backbone of the mutual aid teams in a township or village into the cooperative may seem beneficial to running the cooperative in the short term. However, if running a cooperative collapses many mutual aid teams, it is detrimental to the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement. This directly violates the principle of "running agricultural producers' cooperatives well to drive the great development of mutual aid teams". This is also detrimental to the further development of agricultural producers' cooperatives. Without the development and improvement of a large number of mutual aid teams, and without organizing the vast number of farmers through various forms, it will be very difficult to further develop agricultural producers' cooperatives in the future.
    There are indeed many "troubles" in mutual aid teams, and some contradictions are not easy to solve. However, the efforts made to resolve these contradictions will never be in vain. By constantly paying attention to resolving these contradictions, the collectivist thinking of the masses of farmers can be constantly enhanced, and the ability of the backbone members to manage collective affairs can be constantly improved. This will lay a very good foundation for further running cooperatives. If we now dislike the "troubles" of mutual aid teams and do not pay attention to resolving these contradictions at any time, there will be even greater troubles when we run cooperatives.
    Running agricultural producers' cooperatives well can indeed drive the great development of mutual aid teams. However, this does not mean that mutual aid teams can develop greatly on their own and improve step by step without leadership if agricultural producers' cooperatives are run well. If we only run cooperatives in isolation and do not pay attention to uniting and driving mutual aid teams, mutual aid teams will still not be able to develop well, and even if they do develop, it will be difficult to improve step by step.
    Mutual aid teams are a primary form of mutual aid and cooperation, and agricultural producers' cooperatives are a more advanced form. Mutual aid teams are not as good as cooperatives, which is a fact. However, it must not be thought that leading the work of mutual aid teams is a "lower-level" job, just as the workers who build the foundation of a building cannot be seen as lower than the workers who build the rest of the building. Cadres who lead the development of mutual aid teams should recognize that their work is an important foundation of the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement. As the Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Development of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives says: "It must be understood that our organization of individual farmers to participate in mutual aid teams and our help in doing a good job in mutual aid teams are also for the purpose of facilitating their further guidance to develop into agricultural producers' cooperatives, and preparing for further realizing the complete socialist transformation of agriculture. If we do not regard mutual aid teams as a primary transitional form to gradually guide farmers towards socialist transformation, and therefore do not pay attention to the work of mutual aid teams, this will be a major mistake."
    As for running agricultural producers' cooperatives well, it is essential to have certain conditions, which is also very important. Generally speaking, agricultural producers' cooperatives can only be run well if everyone in the masses is completely voluntary, has truly fair and capable leading backbone members, and has a certain habit and experience of collective labor. In the past, some places did not have these conditions, and they started cooperatives, but as a result, the management work was not done well, the production was not done well, and everyone's income was not as much as when they were in mutual aid teams; even noisy quarrels broke out, and they disbanded halfway. This not only caused losses to the farm households that joined the cooperative, but also had a very bad impact on the masses, and it would be even more difficult to run cooperatives in the future. Therefore, when the conditions are not sufficient, one should not reluctantly engage in it based only on one's own enthusiasm, but should run mutual aid teams well, create conditions, and strive to transform into agricultural producers' cooperatives when the conditions are sufficient.
    How to run mutual aid teams well?
    The most important thing is to always pay attention to grasping one principle: strengthening the unity of poor peasants and middle peasants. The most obvious benefit of mutual aid teams is that they can share what they have and overcome the difficulties of lacking farm tools, livestock, and labor. If only middle peasants help each other, or only poor peasants help each other, it is difficult to achieve this goal. Therefore, when establishing mutual aid teams, poor peasants and middle peasants should be closely united under the principle of voluntariness. After the establishment of mutual aid teams, the most important thing that needs constant attention is the issue of mutual benefit. This is basically the relationship between poor peasants and middle peasants. Labor work points and the price of livestock and farm tools should be reasonably evaluated, so that people with more labor are not at a disadvantage, nor are people with livestock and farm tools at a disadvantage. What kind of exchange ratio is appropriate should be democratically assessed according to local conditions, and it is impossible to make a unified regulation.
    To run mutual aid teams well and truly lay a foundation for running cooperatives, it is also necessary to continuously educate the members in collectivism by continuously solving the specific problems that occur in the teams. Because mutual aid teams are labor organizations for collective mutual aid based on the individual economy, it is inevitable that there will be many contradictions, especially contradictions regarding joint labor and decentralized management. For example, in terms of the rotation of cultivation, each household will inevitably compete to be the first; some people are not active when working on other people's land, and do not cherish other people's livestock and farm tools when using them. These are all manifestations of the contradictions between collective labor and decentralized management. These contradictions are difficult to completely resolve in mutual aid teams, but they must be constantly paid attention to and resolved. Only by constantly paying attention to resolving these contradictions can mutual aid teams be consolidated and improved. Therefore, in the process of democratically discussing and determining the order of crop rotation, and in the process of democratically evaluating each person's labor work points, it is necessary to pay attention not only to solving the specific problems that currently exist, but also to improving everyone's collectivist thinking through the resolution of these specific problems.
    To ensure the correct implementation of mutual benefit policies within mutual aid teams and to improve the ideological awareness of team members, and to ensure the consolidation and improvement of mutual aid teams, an important link is to have leading backbone members. Comrades working in rural areas should not only constantly educate them and help them, but also let them independently solve problems on their own, so that they can truly form a leading core among the masses and gradually cultivate their ability to manage collective production. In order to achieve this goal, the backbone of mutual aid teams should have more contact with cooperatives, and the cadres leading the cooperatives and the cadres within the cooperatives should also actively attract the backbone of mutual aid teams to participate in certain educational meetings of the cooperatives.
    Mutual aid teams are primary and transitional organizational forms, so the forms and systems should be more flexible. As long as the masses are willing and not forced to organize, and as long as the masses feel that there are benefits, they can be organized in any way, and there is no need to rigidly apply certain "specifications"; temporary mutual aid is fine if temporary mutual aid is possible, and year-round mutual aid is fine if year-round mutual aid is possible. At the beginning, it is fine even if it is only collective labor for one season or simple joint labor; it is better if it can be mutual aid for half a year or three major seasons; it is fine even if agriculture and sideline occupations are combined, some simple division of labor is implemented, and a small amount of public property is accumulated, and there is no need to force it if it cannot be done temporarily. In order to promote the great development of mutual aid teams, attention should be paid to fully utilizing and transforming the original forms of mutual aid among the masses, promoting the rational parts, changing the irrational parts, abolishing the habit of eating and drinking heavily when helping with farm work during busy seasons, democratically arranging work, selecting team leaders, and gradually improving.
    In many places, the mutual aid teams are generally experiencing widespread dissatisfaction among team members because the work evaluation and point-keeping system is too complicated, and there are too many meetings in general, and the meeting time is too long, which must be corrected. Some mutual aid teams in some areas have created a method of keeping points by the piece, such as how many points for plowing one mu of land, and how many points for transplanting one mu of rice fields. The scores for completing these tasks are negotiated and evaluated by the team members in advance. In the future, everyone will keep and calculate work according to this, and hold a meeting every five or ten days to check the numbers and keep the accounts. There is no need to hold meetings every night, nor is it necessary to comment on everything. Using this method can not only reduce the number of meetings, but also reduce disputes, and various places can refer to and imitate it.
    While paying attention to the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, we must also pay attention to helping individual farmers carry out production. After the great development of mutual aid and cooperation this spring, there may still be tens of millions of individual farmers. From the perspective of the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement, these tens of millions of farm households are of course the development objects that we must continue to strive for; from the perspective of the current task of completing the agricultural production plan, it is also not allowed to ignore the production enthusiasm of these tens of millions of farm households. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stated in its December 1951 resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation: "The Party fully understands the characteristics of farmers as small private owners and points out that the enthusiasm of farmers in this individual economy cannot be ignored and crudely frustrated."
   "The Central Committee of the Party believes that it is necessary to repeatedly awaken the attention of party committees at all levels and all comrades and non-party activists engaged in rural work, to fully, enthusiastically, and without reservations, take care of, help, and patiently educate individual farmers." In the recently released resolution on the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, this point was once again pointed out, asking everyone to continue to pay practical attention. For individual farmers, we must pay attention to conducting work in two aspects based on their dual nature of being both laborers and private owners: on the one hand, taking care and helping, and on the other hand, patiently educating. Our ultimate goal is to attract all farmers to participate in the socialist cause of agricultural collectivization; however, our method can only be to help and educate. It should be recognized that farmers are able to embark on the road of socialism; it cannot be assumed that individual farming is equal to spontaneous capitalist forces, and individual farming is even less equal to having already embarked on the capitalist road. It's just that, if individual farming continues, if it does not become more impoverished, it will inevitably learn from the exploiters and do some things to exploit others, which is to have a spontaneous capitalist tendency; if it continues to develop, when most of the source of livelihood depends on exploitation, it is to completely embark on the capitalist road. It is wrong to say that individual farming is taking the road of capitalism. Individual farming may take the road of capitalism, but under the current conditions, the possibility of taking the road of socialism is greater. Turning this latter possibility into reality depends on the help and education of the working class (including the cadres of the Party and the government) to the farmers. Therefore, the work of helping and educating individual farmers is also an inseparable part of the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement, creating better conditions for the further development of mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives. Ignoring, discriminating against, or attacking individual farmers is also a damage to the socialist cause.
    Focusing on running agricultural producers' cooperatives well, universally developing mutual aid teams, and making all mutual aid and cooperative organizations the core of uniting the surrounding individual farmers are inseparable aspects of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement. It is only for the convenience of leadership that there must be some division of labor; in actual life, these tasks are intertwined. Therefore, all cadres working in rural areas must comprehensively take care of all aspects of the work, guide the vast number of farmers to organize, and gradually develop from lower-level organizational forms to higher-level organizational forms.

### 互助组是农业生产合作社的重要基础

    互助组是农业生产合作社的重要基础
    我国共有一亿一千多万农户，已经参加各种农业生产互助合作组织的约有四千七百九十多万户，其中参加农业生产合作社的有二十七万三千多户。这说明在已有的互助合作组织当中，普遍地大量地存在的还是互助组；在全体农民当中，还有一大半是单干户。经过一九五四年的努力，参加各种互助合作组织的农户可能达到并超过全国农户总数的百分之五十以上，但参加农业生产合作社的农户在已经组织起来的户数中所占的比例还是很小的；在第一个五年计划时期内，在许多地区，互助组将仍是农业生产的重要形式。每个农村工作的同志，都必须重视这个情况，不可丝毫放松对互助组的领导。
    虽然互助组是农村互助合作运动的初级形式，但它却是最容易为农民接受的一种组织形式，因为它的组织比较简单，而又能够帮助农民克服在单干时难以克服的若干困难，能够减少农民中间的阶级分化现象，也能增加生产。通过互助组，能够使农民初步养成集体劳动的习惯，使农民亲自得到集体生产的经验，并在群众中生长出一批互助合作的领导骨干，这就更便于把互助合作运动推向更高级的形式——农业生产合作社。因此，中共中央在关于发展农业生产合作社的决议中指出“互助组的发展是农业生产合作社发展的重要基础”；并要求在注意加强发展农业生产合作社的领导的同时，也加强发展各种形式的互助组的领导。因此，在农村中，在领导农业生产工作中，应该大量地发展互助组，也可能大量地发展互助组。
    一般地说，现在各地农村工作干部都认识了农业生产合作社的重要，大部分干部和部分群众办社的积极性很高，这是很好的现象。办好了许多农业生产合作社，就可能把整个互助合作运动向前推进一大步，这是可以预期的。但是，也应当指出，有些地方有些干部又产生了轻视互助组的观点。如在宣传工作中，只注意宣传农业生产合作社，不注意宣传互助组，只宣传办社的有利，不宣传办社的条件。从而在群众中造成错觉，认为互助组可以不要了或不重要了，只有合作社才好，并且非入不可。有的地方把互助组中的党员团员积极分子都集中起来办社，无形中把许多互助组抽垮了，拆散了；有的地方不注意研究和解决互助组中存在的问题，认为太麻烦，不好解决，办了合作社自然就解决了；有的地方不注意发展新的互助组，提高临时互助组，运用和改造群众中间固有的互助形式，认为办好了合作社，互助组自然就会大发展；此外，还有部分干部从个人情绪出发，认为领导互助组没有领导合作社“有意思”，因而对于领导互助组不够热心；部分群众积极分子也认为办互助组不如办合作社光荣，在条件不够不能转社时有些“泄气”。这种种情形，都是不好的，会脱离绝大多数群众的现实要求，会削弱整个互助合作运动，是不利于发展与提高农业生产的。
    把一乡一村的互助组中的骨干都集中到合作社里，眼前看来，对于办社是有利的。可是，如果办了一个合作社却把许多互助组都抽垮了，那对整个互助合作运动是不利的。这样，就直接违反了“办好农业生产合作社带动互助组大发展”的原则。这对于农业生产合作社的进一步发展，也是不利的。没有大量互助组的发展和提高，不把广大农民通过各种形式组织起来，将来要进一步发展农业生产合作社就会碰到很大的困难。
    互助组中确实有许多“麻烦”，有一些不易解决的矛盾。可是，为解决这些矛盾而作的努力，决不会是白费的。不断地注意解决这些矛盾，农民群众的集体主义的思想就能够不断地增长，骨干分子管理集体事情的本领就能够不断地提高。这样，就能够为进一步办社打下很好的基础。如果现在嫌互助组“麻烦”，不注意随时解决这些矛盾，办起合作社来就会有更大的麻烦。
    办好了农业生产合作社，确实能够带动互助组大发展。可是，这也决不是说，办好了农业生产合作社，互助组就能自生自长地大大发展起来，不去加以领导就能步步提高起来。如果只是孤立地办社，并不注意团结和带动互助组，互助组还是不可能很好地发展起来的，即使发展起来了也很难一步一步地提高。
    互助组是互助合作的初级形式，农业生产合作社是比较高级的形式，互助组没有合作社好，这是事实。可是，决不能认为，领导互助组的工作是“低人一头”的工作，正如不能把建筑大楼的基础的工人看得比建筑大楼的其余部分的工人低一样。领导发展互助组工作的干部应当认识自己的工作是整个互助合作运动的重要基础。正如中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议中所说的：“必须明白：我们组织个体农民参加互助组以及帮助搞好互助组的工作，也就是为着便利于再引导它们发展成为农业生产合作社，并准备再进而实现完全的农业社会主义改造。如果不把互助组看成是逐步引导农民走向社会主义改造的一种初级的过渡的形式，因而不重视互助组的工作，这将是一个重大的错误。”
    至于要办好农业生产合作社，必须具备一定的条件，这也是十分重要的。一般地说，一定要群众每个人都完全自愿，有真正公道能干的领导骨干，大家有一定的集体劳动的习惯和经验，才能办好农业生产合作社。过去有的地方不具备这些条件，就办起社来，结果管理工作做不好，生产搞不好，大家的收入还没有在互助组的时候多；甚至吵吵闹闹，半路里就散伙了。这样，不但入社的农户受损失，而且在群众中的影响也很坏，以后再要办社就更费力了。因此，条件不具备的时候，就不应该只凭自己的热情去勉强从事，就应该好好地办互助组，创造条件，争取在条件具备时，转为农业生产合作社。
    怎样把互助组办好呢？
    最重要的是要时时注意掌握一条原则：加强贫农和中农的团结。互助组的好处，最明显的就是能够互通有无，克服缺乏农具、牲畜、劳力的困难。如果只是中农和中农互助，或者只是贫农和贫农互助，是很难达到这个目的的。所以，在成立互助组的时候，就应当在自愿的原则下把贫农和中农紧密地团结起来。在成立互助组以后，最需要经常注意的是互利问题。这基本上也就是贫农和中农的关系问题。应当合理地评议劳动工分和牲口、农具的代价，不能使劳力多的人吃亏，也不能使有牲口农具的人吃亏。究竟换工的比价怎样才算合适，要依照当地情况，民主评定，不可能作出统一的规定。
    要办好互助组，并且确实地为办社打下基础，还要通过不断地解决组内发生的具体问题，不断地对组员进行集体主义教育。因为互助组是在个体经济基础上的集体互助的劳动组织，就难免有许多矛盾，特别是关于共同劳动和分散经营的矛盾。譬如：在耕作的轮流方面，各户总难免要争先恐后；有些人在别人的土地上劳动时不积极、使用别人的牲口农具时不爱惜。这些都是集体劳动和分散经营的矛盾的表现。这些矛盾在互助组中是难以彻底解决的，但又是必须经常注意解决的。只有不断注意解决这些矛盾，互助组才能巩固，才能提高。因此，在民主讨论确定轮作次序的过程中，在民主评定每个人的劳动工分的过程中，既要注意解决当前存在的具体问题，也要注意通过这些具体问题的解决，提高大家的集体主义思想。
    要保证互助组内正确地执行互利政策和提高组员的思想觉悟，保证互助组巩固和提高，重要的环节是要有领导骨干。农村工作的同志们，一方面要经常地教育他们、帮助他们，一方面要放手地让他们自己独立地解决问题，让他们在群众中真正形成领导核心，并且逐步地锻炼他们管理集体生产的能力。为了达到这个目的，应当使互助组的骨干多和合作社接触，领导办社的干部和社内干部也应当主动地吸引互助组的骨干参加合作社的某些有教育意义的会议。
    互助组是初级的过渡的组织形式，因此形式和制度更要灵活一些。只要群众自愿，不是强迫编组，只要群众都觉得有好处，怎样组织都可以，不必拿一定的“规格”去硬套；能临时互助就临时互助，能常年互助就常年互助。最初那怕只是集体劳动一季、只是简单的共同劳动也好；能做到半年、三大季互助更好；能农副业结合、实行一些简单的分工，积累少量的公有财产也好，暂时做不到也不要勉强。为了互助组的大发展，应当注意充分运用和改造群众中间原有的互助形式，发扬合理的部分，改掉不合理的部分，废除农忙帮工时大吃大喝的习惯，民主地安排工作、选定组长，逐步提高。
    许多地方的互助组，因为评工记分制度过于繁杂，一般是开会过多，开会时间过长，这是引起组员不满的普遍现象，必须注意纠正。有些地区互助组创造了按件记分办法，如犁一亩地多少分，插一亩秧田多少分，把完成这些工种的分数，事先经过组员协商，评定好，以后大家按此记工、算工，五天或十天开一次会，对对数，记记账，就行了，不必每晚开会，也不必事事品评。采用这种办法，既可以少开会，又可以减少纠纷，各地可以参考仿行。
    注意发展农业生产合作社和互助组的同时，还必须注意帮助单干农民进行生产。今年春季互助合作有了一个大的发展以后，单干农民可能还有几千万户。从整个互助合作运动来说，这几千万农户当然是我们要继续争取的发展对象；从当前完成农业生产计划的任务来说，如果忽视了这几千万农户的生产积极性，也是不能容许的。在一九五一年十二月中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议中就说：“党充分地了解了农民这种小私有者的特点，并指出不能忽视和粗暴地挫折农民这种个体经济的积极性。”
  “党中央认为必须重复地唤起各级党委和一切从事农村工作的同志和非党积极分子的注意，要充分地满腔热情地没有隔阂地去照顾、帮助和耐心地教育单干农民”。在最近发布的关于发展农业生产合作社的决议中，又一次指出这一点，要大家继续切实注意。对于单干农民，必须注意根据他们既是劳动者又是私有者的两重性，进行两方面的工作：一方面是照顾和帮助，一方面是耐心地教育。我们的最后目的是吸引全体农民参加农业合作化的社会主义事业；可是，我们的方法只能是帮助和教育。应当认识到：农民是能够走到社会主义的道路上来的；不能认为单干就等于自发的资本主义势力，单干更不等于已经走上了资本主义道路。只不过，单干下去，如果不是变成更穷困的人，就必然会向剥削者学样子，做一些剥削别人的事，那就是有了自发的资本主义倾向；再发展下去，到大部分生活来源是靠剥削的时候，那就是完全走上资本主义道路了。说单干就是走资本主义的路，那是不对的。单干是可能走资本主义的路的，但在目前的条件下，走社会主义的路的可能性更大。把这后一种可能性变成现实性，就取决于工人阶级（包括党和政府的干部）对农民的帮助和教育。因此，帮助和教育单干农民的工作，也正是整个互助合作运动的不可分的一部分，是为互助组和农业生产合作社的进一步发展创造更好的条件。如果忽视、歧视或打击单干农民，同样是对社会主义事业的损害。
    着重地办好农业生产合作社，普遍地发展互助组，并且使一切的互助合作组织成为团结周围单干农民的核心，是农业生产互助合作运动的不可分割的几个方面。只是为了领导的便利，才不能不有所分工；在实际生活中，这些工作都是交织在一起的。因此，一切农村工作的干部，都必须全面地照顾各方面的工作，引导广大农民组织起来，逐步地由低级的组织形式发展到高级的组织形式。
