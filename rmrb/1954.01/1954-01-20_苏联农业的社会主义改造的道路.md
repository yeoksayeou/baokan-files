The present comes from the past

Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the great Soviet people, under the condition of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the alliance of workers and peasants, through the establishment of large-scale socialist industry and the socialist transformation of agriculture, laid the economic foundation of socialist society, and on this basis built the first socialist society in human history, gradually transitioning to a communist society. The road opened by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in guiding the Soviet people shines brightly on successors in all countries of the world.

Soviet agriculture today is at the forefront of the world. In the Soviet countryside, the world's greatest socialist agricultural system has been established; it includes 94,000 collective farms, 8,950 machine tractor stations, and more than 4,700 state farms. The Soviet Union's powerful socialist industry enables it to have the most mechanized agriculture in the world; the Soviet Union's superior socialist agriculture guarantees the supply of sufficient grain and raw materials to its highly developed cities and industrial centers. Soviet collective farmers are the happiest agricultural workers in the world: they do not know what exploitation is, they have ways to overcome natural disasters and barren land, and they live a wealthy and cultured life. The constantly increasing wealth and purchasing power of Soviet collective farmers ensures that the Soviet countryside becomes an infinitely vast market for the sale of industrial products.

The Soviet people, led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are not satisfied with today's great agricultural achievements. In order to gradually transition to communism, they are making unremitting efforts. They are consolidating the collective farm system organizationally and economically, further developing the public economy of collective farms, and on this basis, increasing the material welfare of collective farm members. They rely on strong industry to further develop the technological equipment of agriculture, consolidate machine tractor stations, and strengthen the assistance of tractor stations to collective farms. They ensure that agriculture and industry, the various departments of agriculture, and the various regions of agriculture develop proportionally, compatibly, and in a balanced manner, in order to guarantee the production of abundant agricultural products. In this way, the Soviet people are preparing the material basis for raising collective farm ownership to ownership by the whole people in the more distant future, and for a communist society that needs the most abundant agricultural products and industrial products.

The Soviet Union's agricultural achievements today and its great future would be unimaginable if the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had not guided the working peasants from 25 million small-scale, individual economies to large-scale, collective socialist economies during the period of building a socialist society in the past. Because the individual small-peasant economy cannot guarantee the large-scale development of industry and agriculture, and in the end cannot avoid the polarization of peasants, this cannot guarantee the transition of society to socialism.

The small-peasant economy using manual labor on scattered small plots of land cannot make good use of agricultural machinery and technological achievements, harvests are lower, and in the event of bad weather, it is even difficult to maintain simple reproduction. Therefore, the small-peasant economy does not provide many marketable agricultural products, and the purchasing power of individual peasants is also very low. This cannot keep up with the rapid growth of cities and industrial centers in the development of national industry and the need for grain, raw materials, and markets. This will lead to disharmony between agriculture and industry, deterioration of urban-rural relations, and the danger of the worker-peasant alliance breaking down. Taking the Soviet Union's grain production as an example, in the 114 years before the October Revolution, the average annual increase in grain harvests in Russia was only two-hundredths of one percent, and there were 14 famines in the 19th century. After the October Revolution, under the conditions of the small-peasant economy, the average annual increase in Soviet grain harvests was only 1.5 percent. After the collective farm system replaced the small-peasant economy, from 1932 to 1940, the total grain harvest in the Soviet Union increased by 42 percent, an average annual increase of 5 percent. Before the Soviet Union realized the socialist transformation of agriculture, due to the development of cities and industrial centers, there were difficulties in the shortage of marketable grain. But after the Soviet Union completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, on the basis of collective farms and state farms, it greatly increased agricultural productivity and marketable grain, guaranteeing the country's grain supply. In 1938, Soviet marketable grain accounted for 40 percent of the total output, while before the October Revolution it was only 26 percent. Is the superiority of socialist agriculture over the small-peasant economy not obvious?

The spontaneous forces of the small-peasant economy, like a vast ocean, do not always stand at a "crossroads" with one road leading to capitalism and the other to socialism. Even under the dictatorship of the proletariat or the people's democratic dictatorship, without the correct policies of the Communist Party, without the leadership of the working class and the support of socialist industry, the spontaneous forces of the small-peasant economy based on private ownership of the means of production would still breed the rural bourgeoisie and push the countryside towards capitalism rather than socialism. What would be the end result of going towards capitalism? The situation of small and medium-sized farmers under the capitalist system in the United States answers this question. In the United States, large tracts of land and agricultural machinery are concentrated in the hands of the rural bourgeoisie. According to a survey in 1950, more than three-quarters of the 5,382,000 farm households in the United States had neither tractors nor horses or mules. In the past six years, agricultural production of small and medium-sized farmers in the United States has only increased by 6 percent, while production costs have increased by 38 percent. Their income last year was about a quarter lower than in 1948, while the property tax and land tax paid last year were 15 times and 3 times that of 1942. As of July 1, 1952, small and medium-sized farmers in the United States owed 14 billion U.S. dollars in debt. From 1935 to 1950, 1.4 million farm households in the United States went bankrupt. These bankrupt farm households supplemented the reserve army of the unemployed in the cities, or fell into the ranks of rural migrant workers. From 1940 to 1946, there were 5 million people who left the countryside and flowed into cities and industrial centers. In 1948, more than 1 million small farmers in the United States had to be employed by large farmers. For the broad masses of working peasants, taking the capitalist road means being enslaved, impoverished, and bankrupt. Isn't this obvious?

	From Cooperatives to Collective Farms

In the socialist construction stage, the Soviet Union guided working peasants from small-scale individual economies to large-scale collective, socialist economies through the road from cooperatives to collective farms. Because cooperatives and their advanced form – collective farms – are organizational forms that can combine the individual interests of working peasants with the public interests of the whole people, and make them subordinate to the public interests, they can be understood and accepted by working peasants, and can organize working peasants to participate in socialist construction.

Soviet experience proves that in countries led by the working class, agricultural cooperation and collectivization is a long-term, gradual development process from low to high, from few to many, and from small to large. Because to make millions of individual peasants who have lived in a decentralized small-scale production system based on private ownership for generations, convinced in practice based on experience of the benefits of collective, socialist large-scale production, and voluntarily organized into cooperatives and collective farms, allowing socialist ownership to replace private ownership - this is by no means an easy task in a short period of time.

After the victory of the October Revolution and the nationalization of land, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union explained to the working peasants that merely obtaining land from the landlords had not carried out the socialist transformation of agriculture, and that it was still not possible to fundamentally improve the lives of working peasants. In the early days of the Soviet regime and the difficult period of foreign armed intervention and domestic war, with the encouragement of the Soviet government, the first batch of demonstrative collective farms and state farms were established to promote the benefits of socialist large-scale production to the working peasants with examples.

During the period of national economic recovery, with the recovery of industry and agriculture and the active trade, cooperative systems that benefited the broad masses of Soviet peasants began to develop. Working peasants began to increasingly join cooperatives in consumption and later in production. Consumer cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives developed first. Because they reduced or eliminated the exploitation of speculators and private merchants, and activated the exchange of materials between socialist industry and the small commodity economy of the peasants, they were most in line with the current needs of the working peasants. In 1926-1927, about half of the total retail trade in the Soviet Union was conducted through agricultural cooperatives. In the five years of the national economic recovery period, the number of various agricultural cooperatives increased more than threefold, mainly supply and marketing cooperatives. But consumer cooperatives are only the primary form of cooperatives, and they cannot transform the production of small commodities. Along with supply and marketing cooperatives, various forms of cooperatives related to agricultural production also developed, such as credit, machinery, soil improvement, livestock, seeds, and other specialized cooperatives and general agricultural cooperatives. In 1925, at the end of the national economic recovery period, 6,589,000 farm households in the Soviet Union, or 28 percent of farm households, participated in cooperatives. At this time, various forms of collective farms, especially land cultivation societies, also developed.

During the period of national industrialization, due to the rapid growth of industry, especially heavy industry (including industries that produce agricultural machinery and fertilizers), and because working peasants increasingly realized the benefits of cooperation and collectivization not only in consumption but also in production, Soviet cooperatives, especially production cooperatives and collective farms, developed even more. From October 1, 1925 to October 1, 1927, the number of peasants joining supply and marketing cooperatives increased by 78 percent, while the number of peasants joining various agricultural production cooperatives increased elevenfold. By October 1, 1926, various agricultural production cooperatives had united 33.1 percent of farm households nationwide, and by October 1, 1929, they had united 55.2 percent of farm households. This shows the development of agricultural cooperation towards the production aspect and its increasing influence.

The development of agricultural cooperation in production is also manifested in the growth of more complex production cooperatives - various forms of collective farms, although this growth was relatively slow in the early stage of national industrialization. Before June 1, 1927, there were only 14,800 collective farms in the Soviet Union, and almost all participants were poor peasants, with some middle peasants also joining land cultivation societies. These collective farms were still small in scale and had small cultivated areas: in 1927, an average collective farm had only 15.5 farm households and cultivated 59.1 hectares of land. At that time, they were distributed in the vast countryside, like small islands in the sea. But this was the most advanced and therefore the most promising stronghold for the socialist transformation of agriculture. Collective farms can adopt advanced farming methods, correct crop rotation systems, new machinery, and good seeds, and can rationally organize labor. Their harvests and the income of their members are always higher than those of surrounding individual farm households. In 1927, the spring wheat harvest of collective farms was 21 percent higher, and the rye harvest was 28 percent higher. Therefore, individual peasants not only learned advanced farming methods from collective farms, but also took the road of organizing themselves. The number of peasants joining various forms of collective farms increased eight and a half times in the two years and four months from June 1, 1927 to October 1, 1929, from 0.8 percent of the country's farm households to 7.6 percent. Collectivization was faster in major grain-producing areas such as the North Caucasus, the Lower Volga, and the Ukrainian steppe. By July 1, 1929, more than one million peasant households (mainly advanced, poor, and working peasants) were organized into 57,000 collective farms of various forms (mostly land cultivation societies). In the second half of 1929, the middle peasants, who accounted for the vast majority of peasants, followed the poor peasants and joined collective farms in entire villages, entire townships, and entire districts. By October 1 of that year, 1,919,000 peasant households were organized into 67,000 collective farms, an increase of about double in three months. This scale of development continued. Therefore, 1929 was a year of great transformation in the socialist transformation of Soviet agriculture. Thus began the period of large-scale construction of collective farms.

Before carrying out the overall collectivization of agriculture, there were three forms of collective farms in the Soviet countryside: land cultivation societies, agricultural communes, and agricultural labor associations. Correctly selecting and promoting appropriate forms of collective farms was of decisive significance for the overall collectivization of agriculture.

Land cultivation societies are a lower form of collectivization. The peasants who join the society only cooperate in labor and jointly cultivate the land during cultivation (sowing, harvesting). Complex machines obtained by the land cultivation society are regarded as public property within the society. Other means of production such as draft animals, agricultural machinery, farm tools, buildings, etc. remain the private property of the original owners, and can only be used jointly during cultivation. The income of the land cultivation society is not only distributed according to the amount of labor spent by the members during joint work, but also according to the type and quantity of means of production they supply to the land cultivation society. Before the overall collectivization of agriculture, the land cultivation society was relatively easy to be accepted by laboring peasants, especially middle peasants, who on the one hand realized the benefits of collective labor such as increasing harvests, and on the other hand were temporarily unwilling to take out privately owned means of production. Therefore, it developed faster than other forms. It played a huge preparatory role for the large-scale establishment of collective farms. However, land cultivation societies did not socialize the means of production and therefore could not completely distribute income according to labor, so they could not achieve the goal of thoroughly socialist transformation of agriculture.

Agricultural communes were originally supposed to be the highest form of agricultural collectivization, and should have emerged from very developed and wealthy collective farms. All their means of production should be socialized, public life should be particularly developed, and public life should be similar to that of workers. But the agricultural communes that appeared at that time did not meet this requirement. In the early days of the Soviet regime, agricultural communes were the most numerous among various collective farms. Most of them were established by returning urban workers, Red guerrillas, and advanced elements among the poor and landless peasants on the land of the former landlords' estates or monasteries. From land to housing to farm tools, all were used by the state. They showed the superiority of the large collective economy over the small individual economy, and played a significant role in collectivization. However, due to the lack of a foundation of developed technology and abundant products, agricultural communes at that time were filled with the petit-bourgeois egalitarianism in needs and life, and neglected the personal interests of members. It could not attract working peasants, especially middle peasants, on a large scale. In order to continue to exist, these agricultural communes had to criticize egalitarianism, change excessively socialized life, start calculating work according to labor days, allow members to raise cows, calves, and poultry, and in fact transformed into agricultural labor associations.

Agricultural labor associations are the form of Soviet socialist agriculture at the present stage. The collective farms of the Soviet Union today are in the form of agricultural labor associations, but more precise. Within the agricultural labor association (collective farm), not only labor and the use of land are socialized, but also the basic means of production (draft animals, farm tools, seeds, feed for public livestock, public buildings, and agricultural product processing enterprises) are socialized. However, houses, a certain number of livestock, and unlimited poultry are still the personal property of the members. In addition to participating in the public economy, which is the main source of the members' happy life, members have a private plot of land to operate their personal small sideline businesses. On the public economy, more work means more pay, and remuneration is obtained according to labor days. Agricultural labor associations are built on the solid foundation of the correct combination of public and personal interests, so they are considered the most appropriate form for implementing the overall collectivization of agriculture.

Before 1929, land cultivation societies were the main form of the Soviet collective farm movement. In 1929, land cultivation societies still accounted for 60.2 percent, agricultural labor associations accounted for 33.6 percent, and agricultural communes accounted for 6.2 percent. In 1931, agricultural labor associations accounted for 91.7 percent, agricultural communes accounted for only 3.6 percent, and land cultivation societies accounted for only 4.7 percent.

Throughout the entire process of the socialist transformation of agriculture, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union paid special attention to the consolidated alliance between the working class and the working peasants, especially the middle peasants. Consolidating the alliance with the working peasants, especially the middle peasants, became even more important due to the changes in classes in the countryside after the implementation of the New Economic Policy. At that time, most of the poor peasant households rose to become middle peasants, greatly increasing the number of middle peasants; and some wealthy middle peasants became rich peasants, also leading to some growth in the number of rich peasants. At the end of the national economic recovery period, before the collectivization movement unfolded, for every 100 households in the Soviet countryside, there were four to five rich peasant households, eight to ten wealthy middle peasant households, forty-five to fifty middle peasant households, and thirty-five poor peasant households. From this, it can be seen that relying on the poor peasants, uniting the middle peasants, and opposing the rich peasants was a major guarantee for guiding working peasants to the socialist economy. Because the large number of poor peasants remained the most reliable ally of the working class in the countryside; because the attitude of the largest number of middle peasants was of decisive significance for the success and speed of the socialist transformation of agriculture; because the rich peasants were not only increasing their exploitative forces, but were also spreading their influence over the middle peasants every day, striving for the middle peasants to take the capitalist road. For example, during the period of developing cooperatives, rich peasant elements once infiltrated cooperatives, attempting to strengthen their influence over the middle peasants through legal means. Therefore, sharp class struggles occurred within cooperatives. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted the correct policy: absorbing poor and middle peasants to participate in the Soviets to increase their political activism; absorbing them to participate in cooperatives and collective farms to increase their economic activism. In order to win over individual working peasants, especially middle peasants, to the socialist track, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union consistently educated cadres to patiently persuade peasants, persuade peasants in practice, and seek the voluntary consent of peasants. By adhering to these principles, and because the Soviet regime adopted policies that restricted the exploitative activities of rich peasants and favored poor and middle peasants in terms of land use, loans, taxation, and trade, working peasants transitioned from poor peasants to middle peasants, and from individual to collective roads in large numbers. The gradual development of agricultural cooperation and collectivization in the Soviet Union was precisely the result of the continuous consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

The maturity of the conditions for the overall collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union was the result of the long-term preparation of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union. The development of socialist industry, the resolute struggle against the rich peasants, the growth of the agricultural cooperative movement, and the excellent experiences of advanced collective farms and state farms all prepared the foundation for the transition to overall collectivization, with peasants from entire townships, entire districts, and entire counties joining collective farms together. After full preparations were made, the Soviet countryside carried out a huge reform, from restricting the rich peasants to eliminating the rich peasant class. This reform was carried out by the state power in combination with the peasant masses from top to bottom. At the beginning of overall collectivization, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out: it should be completed in stages according to different conditions in different places; agricultural labor associations (collective farms) should be the basic form; and the peasants' voluntariness should be respected, and there should be no coercion or commandism. However, many places committed an acute illness and violated these correct principles, allowing the rich peasants to take the opportunity to instigate. This deviation was quickly corrected by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. As a result of the large-scale establishment of collective farms, 61.5 percent of farm households had joined 211,000 collective farms by 1932. If in 1928, 97.3 percent of cultivated land was held in the hands of individual peasants, and each individual peasant household cultivated an average of only 4.5 hectares; then in 1932, 78 percent of cultivated land was held in the hands of collective farms and state farms, with each collective farm cultivating an average of 434 hectares and each state farm cultivating an average of 3,100 hectares. The collective farm system triumphed. Then came the organizational and economic consolidation of collective farms. By 1938, 93.5 percent of farm households in the Soviet Union had joined 212,400 collective farms; collective farms concentrated 99.8 percent of cultivated land in the Soviet Union. Soviet agriculture was equipped with a large number of agricultural machines and agricultural technical cadres. Under the collectivized, mechanized socialist agricultural system, agricultural productivity greatly developed, cultivated land expanded, harvests increased, the grain problem was solved, the lives of collective farmers became wealthier, the Soviet regime gained a new and powerful pillar in the countryside in the form of collective farmers, and the worker-peasant alliance was further consolidated on a new basis.

The process of agricultural cooperation and collectivization in the Soviet Union, if calculated from when the 13th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward the slogan of absorbing peasant masses into cooperatives as much as possible in 1924, to the victory of the collective farm system in 1932, lasted eight years. If you add the transformation of agriculture on the basis of new technology from 1929 to 1938, the entire process took fourteen years. The historical experience of the Soviet Union shows that in countries where the small-peasant economy dominates, the agricultural cooperation and collectivization movement is a long-term effort. In the long process of this movement, we must not let things drift in order to avoid breeding the bourgeois forces in the countryside; nor can we be impetuous and rash in order to avoid deviating from the working peasant masses, especially the middle peasant masses.

Take the Rapid Development of Socialist Industrialization as the Key
Whether in the past stage of building socialism or in the current stage of transitioning to communism, the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union have paid attention to the mutual adaptation of industry and agriculture, and have constantly adjusted the relationship between industry and agriculture. The decision of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on further developing agriculture is also to accelerate the development of agriculture in order to adapt to the growing needs of the people and the rapidly developing industry. It is obvious that if industry and agriculture adapt to each other, the national economy can fully develop and the economic foundation of the worker-peasant alliance will be consolidated.

In the stage of building socialism, the socialist transformation of Soviet agriculture was adapted to the socialist national industrialization. The tractors, agricultural machines, fertilizers, fuel, electricity, and building materials produced by socialist industry, as well as machine tractor stations and state farms, gave the working peasants a decisive influence and helped them embark on the socialist road. This would be unimaginable if the socialist sector of industry did not occupy an absolute advantage, and if heavy industry did not develop rapidly. On the other hand, the transformed agriculture created an infinitely vast base of grain and industrial raw materials and a market for industrial products for industry. This would be unimaginable if the socialist agricultural system had not replaced the small-peasant individual economy. Therefore, socialist national industrialization is the key to the socialist transformation of agriculture. And the socialist transformation of agriculture is a necessary condition for further developing industry.

When the national economy was still in the recovery period, the socialist large-scale industry in the cities of the Soviet Union had not yet developed much, and its incompatibility with the small-peasant production in the countryside had not yet threatened the development of the national economy. But even in this period, there were examples of mutual influence between industry. The Soviet industrial output increased by an average of 41 percent per year in these five years, of which it only increased by 30.7 percent in 1922 and only 16.4 percent in 1924. This was a consequence of the poor agricultural harvest in 1921 and the scissors difference in the prices of industrial and agricultural products in the autumn of 1923 leaving industry. By the period of national industrialization, the small-peasant economy, which could only provide 11 percent of grain as a commodity, had brought a threat of grain difficulties to urban residents and the army. The incompatibility of industry and agriculture, manifested in the grain crisis, once urged the socialist transformation of agriculture to proceed.

The decisive factor in the transformation of agricultural production is machinery. The cooperative and collectivization movement of Soviet agriculture began before industry supplied agriculture with a large number of tractors and agricultural machines, but its large-scale expansion and completion only occurred after agriculture obtained a large number of tractors and agricultural machines from industry. Because only by replacing manual labor and draft animals with machinery can agricultural production become large-scale and agricultural productivity develop by leaps and bounds. Mechanized production tools are difficult to use without socialist large farms, and socialist large farms cannot complete the task of transforming production without mechanized production tools. Lenin said: "If we could produce 100,000 first-class tractors tomorrow, give them gasoline, and give them drivers (you know very well that this is still a dream at the moment), then the middle peasants would say: 'I approve of the Komni’ (i.e., approve of communism)." (Lenin's report on rural work at the 8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (B) in 1919). Therefore, to realize mechanized, large-scale agricultural production to adapt to highly technical industrial production, on the one hand, it is required to establish a socialist agricultural system in the countryside, and on the other hand, it is required to establish a heavy industry that manufactures tractors and agricultural machines. And that's what the Soviet Union did.

The Soviet tractor industry also developed from nothing, from small to large. The Soviet Union only produced two experimental tractors in 1922. From 1922 to 1930, most of the tractors in the Soviet Union were imported, totaling more than 60,000 units, and 23,000 units were imported in 1930 alone. Before 1928, the agricultural tools used in agricultural production were mainly horse-drawn farm tools. At that time, peasants already liked tractors because they plowed deeper and cost much less. By the period of national industrialization, the Soviet Union had vigorously developed the tractor industry. From 1930 to 1933, the tractor factories in Stalingrad, Kharkov, and Chelyabinsk, the combine harvester factory in Saratov, and the agricultural machinery factories in Rostov, Gomel, and Tashkent started operations. From 1932, the import of tractors was stopped. From 1928-1929 to 1938, the Soviet tractor industry supplied the national agriculture with 537,100 tractors. In 1938, Soviet agriculture ranked first in the world in new technical equipment.

It is not accidental that in the Soviet Union during the national economic recovery period, the cooperative movement progressed faster in areas close to socialist industry that produced sugar beets, potatoes, tobacco, and milk; and during the period of overall collectivization of agriculture, the collectivization movement also progressed faster in the main grain-producing areas that first obtained machines and established machine tractor stations. This shows the role of socialist industry in transforming agriculture.

Most of the machines supplied to agriculture by Soviet industry are concentrated in machine tractor stations. By handing over the machines to the state's tractor stations for use instead of selling them to collective farms, it was ensured that old machines could be constantly replaced with new machines, and new production technologies could be constantly used to increase harvests, which collective farms could not do on their own. Machine tractor stations are socialist enterprises and the pillars of the state in transforming agriculture in the countryside. They are the decisive conditions for guaranteeing the realization of agricultural collectivization and mechanization. They serve collective farms with their machines, mechanical personnel, agronomists, and gasoline. Collective farms pay the state directly in kind for the services of machine tractor stations. But machine tractor stations are not machine "rental offices," they also help collective farms organizationally, in production, and technically. Machine tractor stations are established and developed to adapt to the requirements of agricultural collectivization and mechanization, and have also gone through a process from small to large and from few to many. In 1928, there were only some tractor teams. In early 1930, there were only 158 machine tractor stations, serving 11,600 collective farms, cultivating more than a quarter of the collective farms' land - 10.4 million hectares; in 1932, there were 2,446 machine tractor stations, serving 71,800 collective farms, cultivating about half of the collective farms' land - 45.1 million hectares. By 1937, there were 5,818 machine tractor stations, serving 91.5 percent of collective farms, and their service range included all the main areas producing grain, cotton, and sugar beets. Obviously, machine tractor stations developed to adapt to the growth of collective farms and their cultivated land, and this development took the rapid development of the tractor industry as the key.

Some of the machines supplied to agriculture by Soviet industry are used by state farms. State farms are state-owned enterprises, and together with machine tractor stations and collective farms, they constitute the Soviet socialist countryside. State farms are not only state-owned factories for manufacturing agricultural products, but more importantly, they are living examples established by the state in the countryside to publicize the superiority of large-scale socialist economy to peasants. In the long process of transforming agriculture, state farms help and educate the surrounding peasants with their scale, their machines, and their technology. This greatly promoted the peasants' goodwill towards large-scale production and powerfully helped the development of the agricultural cooperation and collectivization movement. In 1928, there were 2,832 state farms in the Soviet Union, and in 1938, there were 3,961. The constantly updated and increasing agricultural technical equipment needed by state farms naturally also depends on industry.

Contract purchasing system played an important role in guaranteeing the compatibility of industry and agriculture and in strengthening the planned leadership of the national economy. The Soviet Union began to replace the surplus grain requisition system with grain tax during the period of national economic recovery, and later replaced the surplus grain requisition system with procurement. At the end of the recovery period, it adopted the contract purchasing system. During the period of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, the contract purchasing system became the basic method for the state to purchase agricultural products. It was not until 1933 that the Soviet Union replaced the contract purchasing system with a mandatory procurement system for grain, sunflowers, potatoes, meat, milk, and wool. Because at this time, the socialist agricultural system triumphed, and the in-kind remuneration obtained by the state from mandatory procurement and tractor stations was already able to guarantee the supply of grain nationwide. Therefore, let peasants freely dispose of the remaining grain after mandatory delivery in order to improve their production enthusiasm. However, the contract purchasing system has been maintained for industrial crops such as cotton, sugar beets, hemp, and vegetables. The purchase contract is signed by the state purchasing agency (or cooperative) and collective farmers (or individual farmers) according to the state's purchase plan. On the one hand, farmers sell the specified agricultural products to the state at the state purchase price at a certain time and place; on the other hand, the purchasing agency pays the price, issues additional bonuses, and advances funds. The contract purchasing system makes it easy for the state to control agricultural product prices and to plan and lead agricultural production. The contract purchasing system also encouraged the improvement of agricultural production, because in the contract, farmers guaranteed good production, and the state guaranteed to provide organizational and agricultural technical assistance. The contract purchasing system enables socialist industry to have direct contact with agriculture, thus eliminating the intermediate exploitation of speculators and strengthening the exchange of industrial products and agricultural products and the connection between urban and rural areas. These, as well as the preferential conditions given to collective farms by the contract purchasing system, made the contract purchasing system an important factor in promoting the development of the collectivization movement during the period of agricultural collectivization.

The Soviet Union, due to the victorious completion of socialist national industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, completely eliminated the exploiting classes, put the production methods of both industry and agriculture on the basis of the socialization of the means of production, and enabled both industry and agriculture to expand reproduction with high technology and produce increasingly rich industrial and agricultural products, only then was a socialist society built and was it possible to prepare for the transition to the highest ideal of mankind - a communist society.

    今天是从昨天来的
    在光荣的苏联共产党领导下的伟大的苏联人民，在无产阶级专政和工农联盟的条件下，经过大规模的社会主义工业的创立和农业的社会主义改造，打下了社会主义社会的经济基础，并且在这个基础上建设成功了人类历史上第一个社会主义社会，逐渐过渡到共产主义社会去。苏联共产党指引苏联人民所开辟的这条道路，光芒万丈地照亮世界各国的后继者。
    苏联今天的农业已经走在世界的最前头。在苏联农村中，建立了世界上最伟大的社会主义农业制度；它包括九万四千个集体农庄、八千九百五十个机器拖拉机站和四千七百多个国营农场。苏联的强大的社会主义工业，使得苏联拥有世界上机械化程度最高的农业；苏联的优越的社会主义农业，又保证供给苏联高度发达的城市和工业中心以充足的粮食和原料。苏联集体农民是世界上最幸福的农业劳动者：他们不知道什么是剥削，他们有战胜自然灾害和贫瘠土地的办法，他们过着富裕的有文化的生活。苏联集体农民不断增长的富裕生活和购买力，保证苏联农村成为销售工业品的无限广阔的市场。
    苏联共产党所领导的苏联人民并没有以今天农业这样巨大成就为满足。为了逐渐过渡到共产主义去，他们不懈地进行着一切努力。他们在组织上和经济上巩固集体农庄制度，进一步发展集体农庄的公共经济，并且在这个基础上增进集体农庄庄员的物质福利。他们依靠强大的工业，进一步发展着农业的技术装备，巩固机器拖拉机站，加强拖拉机站对集体农庄的援助。他们使农业与工业，使农业各部门，使农业各地区，合比例地、相适应地、平衡地发展，以保证生产丰富的农产品。这样，苏联人民为较远的将来把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制，为需要最丰富的农产品和工业品的共产主义社会准备着物质基础。
    苏联今天的农业成就和它的伟大前途，如果不是苏联共产党在已往建设社会主义社会时期引导劳动农民从二千五百万户小规模的、个体经济走到大规模的、集体的社会主义经济，那是不可想像的。因为个体的小农经济既不能保证工农业的大规模发展，到后也不能避免农民的两极分化，这样就不能保证社会向社会主义的过渡。
    在分散的小块土地上用手工劳动的小农经济，不能很好利用农业机器和技术的成就，收成较低，遇着天年不好，甚至难于维持简单的再生产。所以小农经济提供的商品农产品不多，而个体农民的购买力也很低。这样就赶不上在国家工业发展时候城市和工业中心的迅速增长中对粮食、对原料、对市场的需要。这样就会造成农业与工业不协调，城乡关系恶化，工农联盟破裂的危险。以苏联的谷物生产为例，俄国在十月革命前一百十四年中谷物收获量平均每年只增长二百分之一，在十九世纪发生过十四次荒年。十月革命后，在小农经济条件下，苏联谷物收获量平均每年只增长百分之一点五。集体农庄制度代替了小农经济以后，一九三二年到一九四○年期间，苏联所有谷物收获量提高了百分之四十二，即平均每年增长百分之五。苏联在没有实现对农业的社会主义改造以前，由于城市和工业中心的发展，发生过商品粮食不足的困难。但苏联在完成对农业的社会主义改造以后，在集体农庄和国营农场的基础上，大大提高了农业生产力和商品粮食，保证了国家的粮食供应。一九三八年苏联商品谷物占全部产量的百分之四十，而十月革命前不过占百分之二十六。社会主义农业比小农经济优越，不是很明显吗？
    像汪洋大海的小农经济的自发势力，并不是永远站在一条通向资本主义和另一条通向社会主义的“十字路口”的。即使在无产阶级专政或者人民民主专政的条件下，如果没有共产党的正确政策，如果没有工人阶级的领导和社会主义工业的支持，那么基于生产资料私有制的小农经济的自发势力，仍然会滋长农村资产阶级，而把农村冲向资本主义而不是社会主义去的。向资本主义去会有什么结局呢？在美国资本主义制度下的中小农户的情况回答了这个问题。在美国，大块土地和农业机器都集中农村资产阶级手里。据一九五○年调查，美国五百三十八万二千农户中，四分之三以上农户中没有拖拉机也没有马、骡。最近六年中，美国中小农户的农业生产只增长百分之六，而生产费用却增长百分之三十八。他们的收入在去年比一九四八年减低约四分之一，而去年缴纳的财产税和土地税，却为一九四二年的十五倍和三倍。美国中小农户截至一九五二年七月一日欠了一百四十亿美元的债。从一九三五年到一九五○年，美国有一百四十万农户破产。这些破产的农户补充到城市的失业后备军中去，或者落为农村的流浪短工。从一九四○年到一九四六年，这种离弃农村流进城市和工业中心的有五百万人。一九四八年，美国小农户中有一百多万人不得不受雇于大农场主。对于广大的劳动农民说来，走资本主义道路，就是被奴役、贫困和破产，不是很明显吗？
      由合作社到集体农庄
    苏联在建设社会主义阶段，是经过由合作社到集体农庄的道路，引导劳动农民从小规模的个体经济走到大规模的、集体的、社会主义经济的。因为合作社及其高级形式——集体农庄是这样一种组织形式，它们能够把劳动农民的个人利益和全民的公共利益结合起来，并且使它服从公共利益，所以能够为劳动农民所了解和接受，能够把劳动农民组织起来参加社会主义建设。
    苏联的经验证明：在工人阶级领导的国家中，农业的合作化、集体化，是由低级到高级，由少到多，由小到大的，长期的逐步的发展过程。因为要使千百万世世代代在私有制基础上过惯分散的小生产的个体农民，在实践中根据经验确信集体的、社会主义大生产的好处，自愿地组织到合作社和集体农庄中来，让社会主义所有制代替私有制，——这决不是短匆时期轻而易举的事业。
    十月革命胜利和土地国有以后，苏联共产党就向劳动农民解释说，仅仅从地主手里取得了土地，还没有对农业实行社会主义改造，是还不能根本改善劳动农民的生活的。在苏维埃政权初建和外国武装干涉与国内战争困难时期，在苏联政府的鼓励下，建立了第一批示范性质的集体农庄和国营农场，以实例向劳动农民宣传了社会主义大生产的好处。
    在国民经济恢复时期，在工农业恢复和贸易活跃的情况下，苏联广大农民蒙受到利益的合作制，开始发展起来。劳动农民开始在消费方面、后来在生产方面日益增加地联合到合作社中去。消费合作社和供销合作社最先发展起来。因为它们使劳动农民少受或免受投机商人和私商的剥削，活跃社会主义工业与农民小商品经济之间的物资交流，最切合劳动农民当前的需要。在一九二六—一九二七年，全苏零售贸易约一半是经过农业合作社进行的。在国民经济恢复时期的五年中，各种农业合作社的数目增加了三倍多，主要是供销性质的合作社。但消费方面的合作社，只是合作社的初级形式，它们不能改造小商品的生产。随着供销合作社，也发展了各种形式的与农业生产有关的合作社，如信贷、机器、改良土壤、饲畜、种籽等等专门合作社和一般农业合作社。在一九二五年，国民经济恢复时期末，全苏联有六百五十八万九千农户，即百分之二十八农户参加了合作社。这时各种形式的集体农庄，特别是土地共耕社，也有了发展。
    在国家工业化时期，由于工业首先是重工业（包括生产农业机器和肥料的工业）的迅速增长，由于劳动农民不但在消费方面而且进一步在生产方面日益深刻地认识到合作化、集体化的好处，苏联的合作社，特别是生产合作社和集体农庄，有更大的发展。从一九二五年十月一日到一九二七年十月一日，加入供销合作社的农民增加了百分之七十八，而加入各种农业生产合作社的农民增加了十一倍。到一九二六年十月一日，各种农业生产合作社联合了全国百分之三十三点一的农户，到一九二九年十月
  一日，已联合百分之五十五点二的农户。这说明，农业合作化向生产方面的发展，它的影响的日益扩大。
    农业合作化在生产方面的发展，也表现在比较复杂的生产合作社——各种形式的集体农庄的增长上，虽然在国家工业化初期这种增长是比较缓慢的。在一九二七年六月一日以前，全苏联只有一万四千八百个集体农庄，参加的差不多全是贫农，也有些中农参加土地共耕社。这些集体农庄规模还小，耕地面积也不大：在一九二七年平均一个集体农庄只有十五个半农户，种地五十九点一公顷。当时它们分布在广大的农村中，好像是大海中的小岛。但这是农业社会主义化的最先进的、因此也是最有发展前途的据点。集体农庄能采用先进的耕作法、正确的轮种制、新机器、好种籽，它能合理地组织劳动，它的收获量和庄员收入总是比周围个体农户高。一九二七年，集体农庄的春小麦收获量高百分之二十一，黑麦收获量高百分之二十八。因此个体农民不但向集体农庄学习先进的农作方法，而且走上它们组织起来的道路。加入各种形式的集体农庄的农民，从一九二七年六月一日到一九二九年十月一日的两年又四个月中，从原占全国农户百分之零点八，上升到占全国农户百分之七点六，即增长了八倍半。集体化较快的是高加索北部、伏尔加下游、乌克兰草原地带等主要产粮区。到一九二九年七月一日，一百万户以上的农民（主要是先进的、贫苦的劳动农民）组织在五万七千个各种形式的集体农庄（大部分是土地共耕社）中。一九二九年下半年，占农民绝大多数的中农追随着贫农，整个村整个乡整个区地加入集体农庄。到这年十月一日，
  一百九十一万九千户农民组织在六万七千个集体农庄中，即三个月中约增一倍。这种发展规模继续着。因此一九二九年是苏联农业社会主义改造的伟大转变的一年。于是开始了大规模建设集体农庄时期。
    在进行农业全盘集体化以前，苏联农村中已存在三种形式的集体农庄：土地共耕社、农业公社、农业劳动组合。正确地挑选和推广适当形式的集体农庄，这对于农业全盘集体化是有决定意义的。
    土地共耕社是集体化的低级形式。入社的农民只把在耕作（播种、收割）时的劳动和共耕的土地合作化。由共耕社获得的复杂机器作为社内公共财产。其他如耕畜、农业机器、农具、建筑物等生产资料依旧留作原主私有财产，只有耕作时可以共同使用。共耕社的收入不但按照社员在共同工作时所费的劳动量来分配，而且按照他们供给共耕社的生产资料的种类和数量来分配。在农业全盘集体化以前，对于一方面认识到集体劳动有提高收获量等好处，另一方面暂时不愿意拿出私有的生产资料的劳动农民，特别是中农，共耕社是比较容易被接受的，所以比其他形式发展得快。对于大规模建立集体农庄，起了巨大的准备作用。但是土地共耕社没有把生产资料社会化因而不能完全按劳动分配收入，所以不能达到把农业彻底社会主义改造的目的。
    农业公社本来应该是农业集体化的最高形式，应该从非常发达和富裕的集体农庄中产生，它的一切生产资料社会化，公共生活特别发展，公共生活近似工人。但是当时出现的农业公社是不符合这个要求的。在苏维埃政权初建时期，在各种集体农庄中以农业公社为最多。它们多半是回乡的城市工人、红色游击队员和贫雇农中先进分子在原先地主的庄园或寺院的土地上建立起来的。从土地到住屋、农具都是使用国家的。它们显现了大的集体经济对小的个体经济的优越性，对于集体化起了很大作用。但是由于不能有发达的技术和丰富的产品作基础，当时农业公社在需要和生活上充满着小资产阶级的平均主义，又忽视社员的个人利益。它不能大规模地吸引劳动农民特别是中农。这些农业公社后来为了继续存在，不得不批判平均主义，改变过分社会化的生活，开始按劳动日计算工作，允许社员养母牛、小牛、家禽，事实上转变为农业劳动组合。
    农业劳动组合是苏联社会主义农业现阶段的形式。苏联现在的集体农庄就是农业劳动组合这种形式，不过更加精密而已。在农业劳动组合（集体农庄）内，不仅劳动和土地的使用社会化了，基本的生产资料（耕畜、农具、种籽、公有牲畜用的饲料、公用的建筑物、农产品加工企业）也社会化了。但是住宅、一定数目的家畜和无限制的家禽还是庄员个人的。除了参加作为庄员幸福生活主要来源的公共经济以外，庄员有一块宅旁园地经营个人小副业。在公共经济上，多劳多得，按劳动日取得报酬。农业劳动组合是建立在这样公共利益与个人利益正确结合的结实基础之上，所以被认为实行农业全盘集体化中最适当的形式。
    在一九二九年以前，土地共耕社是苏联集体农庄运动中的主要形式。在一九二九年土地共耕社还占百分之六○点二，农业劳动组合占百分之三十三点六，农业公社占百分之六点二。在一九三一年，农业劳动组合已占百分之九十一点七，农业公社只占百分之三点六，土地共耕社只占百分之四点七。
    在进行农业的社会主义改造的整个过程中，苏联共产党特别注意工人阶级与劳动农民尤其是与中农的巩固联盟。巩固与劳动农民特别是与中农的联盟，由于实行新经济政策以后，农村中阶级的变化而显得更加重要。当时贫农户大部分上升为中农，使中农大大增加；而某些富裕中农变为富农，使富农也有某些增长。国民经济恢复时期末，集体化运动展开以前，在苏联农村每一百户中有四到五户富农，八到十户富裕中农，四十五到五十户中农，三十五户贫农。从这可以看出，依靠贫农，联合中农，反对富农的政策，对于引导劳动农民走到社会主义经济是重大的保证。因为为数尚多的贫农依然是工人阶级在农村中最可靠的同盟者；因为为数最多的中农的态度，对于农业的社会主义改造的成功与速度有决定的意义；因为富农不但在增长自己的剥削势力，而且每日在散布对中农的影响，在争取中农走资本主义道路。例如在发展合作社时期，富农分子曾经钻到合作社中去，企图利用合法方式来加强自己对中农的影响，因此在合作社内发生过尖锐的阶级斗争。苏联共产党采取了正确的政策：吸收贫农中农参加苏维埃，以提高他们的政治积极性；吸收他们参加合作社和集体农庄，以提高他们的经济积极性。为了争取个体的劳动农民特别是中农到社会主义轨道上来，苏联共产党一贯教育干部，要耐心说服农民，在实践中说服农民，求得农民自愿同意。由于遵守这些原则，由于苏维埃政权在土地使用、贷款、税收、贸易种种方面采取了限制富农剥削活动和优待贫农、中农的政策，劳动农民由贫农而中农，由个别而大批地转到集体化的道路上来了。苏联农业合作化、集体化之逐步发展，正是不断巩固工农联盟的结果。
    苏联农业全盘集体化的条件的成熟，是苏联共产党和政府长期准备的结果。社会主义工业的发展，对富农的坚决斗争，农业合作社运动的增长，先进的集体农庄与国营农场的优良经验，所有这些准备好了过渡到全盘集体化，整乡、整区、整县农民一同加入集体农庄的基础。有了全面的充分的准备以后，苏联农村才进行巨大的改革，从限制富农进而消灭富农阶级。这种改革是国家政权与农民群众自上而下结合进行的。在开始全盘集体化时，苏联共产党就指出：要根据各地不同条件分期完成；要以农业劳动组合（集体农庄）为基本形式；要尊重农民的自愿，不要强迫命令。但是许多地方犯了急性病，违反了这些正确原则，使富农有可能乘机挑拨。这种偏向很快被苏联共产党中央所纠正了。大规模建立集体农庄的结果，一九三二年已有百分之六十一点五的农户加入为数二十一万一千的集体农庄。如果在一九二八年，有百分之九十七点三耕地握在个体农民手中，而每户个体农民平均只种地四点五公顷；那么在一九三二年，有百分之七十八耕地握在集体农庄和国营农场手里，而每个集体农庄平均种地四百三十四公顷，每个国营农场平均种地三千一百公顷。集体农庄制度胜利了。接着是在组织与经济上巩固集体农庄。到一九三八年，全苏联九十三点五的农户加入了二十一万二千四百个集体农庄；集体农庄集中了全苏联百分之九十九点八耕地。苏联农业配备了大量的农业机器和农业技术干部。在集体化机械化的社会主义农业制度下，农业生产力大大发展了，耕地扩大了，收获量提高了，谷物问题解决了，集体农民的生活富裕起来了，苏维埃政权在农村中得到了集体农民这样新的强有力的支柱，工农联盟在新的基础上更加巩固了。
    苏联农业的合作化、集体化过程，如果从一九二四年苏联共产党第十三次代表大会提出了尽量吸收农民群众加入合作社的口号的时候算起，到一九三二年集体农庄制度胜利为止，经过了八个年头，如果再加上从一九二九年到一九三八年在新技术的基础上对农业的改造，前后总共经过了十四个年头。苏联的历史经验说明：在小农经济占优势的国家里，农业的合作化、集体化运动是长期的努力过程。在这个运动的长期过程中，既不能放任自流，以免滋长农村中的资产阶级势力；也不能急躁冒进，以免脱离劳动农民特别是中农群众。
    以社会主义的工业化的迅速
        发展为关键
    不论在已往建设社会主义阶段，不论在现在过渡到共产主义阶段，苏联共产党和政府都注意工业与农业的互相适应，经常调节工业与农业之间的关系。苏联共产党中央九月全会关于进一步发展农业的决定，也就是为着使农业加速发展，以便与增长着的人民需要，与迅速发展的工业相适应。工业与农业相适应了，国民经济才能充分发展，工农联盟的经济基础才会巩固，这是很明显的。
    在建设社会主义阶段，苏联农业的社会主义改造是与社会主义的国家工业化相适应的。社会主义工业所生产的拖拉机、农业机器、肥料、燃料、电力、建筑材料，以及机器拖拉机站、国营农场，给劳动农民以决定性的影响，帮助他们走上社会主义道路。如果工业中社会主义部分没有占绝对优势，如果重工业没有迅速发展，那么这是不可想像的。另一方面，改造后的农业为工业创造了无限广阔的粮食与工业原料基地和工业品市场。如果社会主义农业制度没有代替了小农个体经济，那么这也是不可想像的。所以，社会主义的国家工业化是农业的社会主义改造的关键。而农业的社会主义改造是进一步发展工业的必要条件。
    当国民经济还处在恢复时期，苏联城市的社会主义的大工业还没有怎样发展，它和乡村的小农生产之间的不相适应还没有威胁国民经济的发展。但是就在这个时期中，也有工业互相影响的例子。苏联工业产量在这个五年中平均每年增长百分之四十一，其中一九二二年只增长百分之三十点七，一九二四年只增长百分之十六点四，这是由于一九二一年农业的歉收和一九二三年秋季工农业产品价格的剪刀差现象留给工业的结果。到国家工业化时期，只能提供百分之十一谷物为商品的小农经济，已带给城市居民和军队以粮食困难的威胁。在谷物危机上面表现出来的工农业的不相适应，曾经催促着农业的社会主义改造的进行。
    对农业生产的改造有决定性影响的因素是机器。苏联农业的合作化、集体化运动，在工业供给农业以大批拖拉机和农业机器以前就开始了，但它的大规模的展开和完成，只是在农业从工业获得大批的拖拉机和农业机器以后。因为只有以机器代替了手工和耕畜，农业生产才能成为大规模的，农业生产力才能飞跃地发展。机械化的生产工具没有社会主义的大农庄是难以施展的，社会主义的大农庄没有机械化的生产工具是不能完成改造生产的任务的。列宁说过：“如果我们明天就能够拿出十万架头等拖拉机，给以汽油，给以驾驶员（你们十分知道，这在目前还是一种梦想），那么中农就会说：‘我赞成康姆尼’（即赞成共产主义）”。（列宁一九一九年在俄国共产党（布）第八次代表大会上关于农村工作的报告）。所以，要实现机械化的农业大规模生产，以适应高度技术的工业生产，一方面要求在农村中建立社会主义农业制度，另一方面要求建立制造拖拉机和农业机器的重工业。而苏联就是这样做了。
    苏联拖拉机工业也是由无到有，由小到大的。苏联在一九二二年才出产两台试验的拖拉机。从一九二二年到一九三○年，苏联的拖拉机绝大部分是输入的，共输入了六万多台，在一九三○年一年中就输入二万三千台。在一九二八年以前，农业生产中所用的农具主要还是马拉农具。当时农民已经喜欢拖拉机耕得深，成本便宜得多。到国家工业化时期，苏联已大力发展拖拉机工业。从一九三○到一九三三年，在斯大林格勒、哈尔科夫、车里雅宾斯克的拖拉机工厂，在萨拉托夫的收割联合机工厂，在罗斯多夫、哥米尔、塔什干的农业机器工厂开工了。从一九三二年起就停止了拖拉机的进口。从一九二八—
  一九二九年到一九三八年，苏联拖拉机工业供给了全国农业五十三万七千一百台拖拉机。在一九三八年，苏联农业在新式技术装备上已占世界第一位。
    不是偶然的，苏联在国民经济恢复时期，那些与社会主义工业接近的，产甜菜、马铃薯、烟草、牛乳的地区，合作化的运动进展得比较快；在农业全盘集体化时期，那些首先得到了机器，建立了机器拖拉机站的基本产粮地区，集体化的运动也进展得比较快。这表现了社会主义的工业对改造农业的作用。
    苏联工业供给农业的机器，绝大部分是集中在机器拖拉机站使用的。由于把机器交给国家的拖拉机站使用而不卖给集体农庄，就保证了能经常以新式机器代替陈旧机器，经常运用新的生产技术来提高收获，而这是集体农庄独自的力量做不到的。机器拖拉机站是社会主义的企业，是国家在农村中改造农业的支柱。它们是保证实现农业集体化机械化的决定性条件。它们以自己的机器、机械人员、农艺人员、汽油，为集体农庄服务。集体农庄按照机器拖拉机站服务的情况直接向国家付出实物报酬。但是机器拖拉机站不是机器“出租处”，它们还在组织上、在生产和技术上帮助集体农庄。机器拖拉机站适应着农业集体化机械化的要求来建立和发展，也是经过由小到大、由少到多的过程的。在一九二八年还只是一些拖拉机队。一九三○年初，只有一百五十八个机器拖拉机站。为一万一千六百个集体农庄服务，耕种了集体农庄的四分之一以上土地——一千零四十万公顷；一九三二年，已有二千四百四十六个机器拖拉机站，为七万一千八百个集体农庄服务，耕种了集体农庄的约半数土地——四千五百一十万公顷。到一九三七年，已有五千八百十八个机器拖拉机站，为百分之九十一点五集体农庄服务，它们的服务范围已包括产谷物、产棉花、产甜菜的一切主要地区。显然，机器拖拉机站是适应着集体农庄及其耕地的增长而发展的，而这种发展是以拖拉机工业的迅速发展为关键的。
    苏联工业供给农业的机器，一部分由国营农场使用。国营农场是国家的企业，它们与机器拖拉机站和集体农庄构成了苏联的社会主义农村。国营农场不但是国家制造农产品的工厂，更重要的是国家在农村建立起来以向农民宣传大规模的社会主义经济的优越性的活榜样。在改造农业的长期过程，国营农场以自己的规模，以自己的机器和技术，帮助和教育周围的农民。这大大促进了农民对大生产的好感，有力地帮助了农业合作化、集体化运动的发展。在一九二八年苏联有二千八百三十二个国营农场，一九三八年已有三千九百六十一个。国营农场所需要的不断更新的和日益增加的农业技术装备，自然也要依靠工业。
    在保证工农业的相适应上，在加强对国民经济的计划领导上，合同定购制起了重要的作用。苏联在国民经济恢复时期开始，以粮食税代替了余粮征集制，后来以收购代替了余粮征集制，到恢复时期末，转取了合同定购制。国家工业化和农业集体化时期，合同定购制成为国家采购农产品的基本方式。直到一九三三年，苏联才以对粮食、向日葵、马铃薯、肉类、牛乳、毛的义务采购制代替了合同定购制。因为这时，社会主义农业制度胜利，国家从义务采购和拖拉机站所得的实物报酬，已经能够保证全国粮食的供应。所以让农民在义务交售以后，自由处理余下的粮食，以提高他们的生产积极性。但对棉花、甜菜、麻等工业作物和蔬菜一直保持着合同定购制。定购合同是由国家采购机关（或合作社）与集体农民（或个体农民）之间根据国家的定购计划订立的。一方面农民按照国家采购价格，以规定的农产品，在一定期限和地点，售给国家；另一方面，采购机关按价付款、发给补加奖金和预支款。合同定购制使国家便于掌握农业品价格，便于有计划地领导农业生产。合同定购制也鼓励了农业生产的提高，因为在合同中农民保证很好生产，而国家保证给以组织上和农业技术上的帮助。合同定购制使社会主义工业与农业发生直接联系，因而排除了投机分子的中间剥削，加强了工业品与农产品的交流和城乡的联系。这些，以及合同定购制给予集体农庄的优待条件，使合同定购制在农业集体化时期成为促进集体化运动发展的重要因素。
    苏联由于胜利地完成了社会主义的国家工业化和农业的社会主义改造，完全消灭了剥削阶级，把工业和农业的生产方式都放在生产资料社会化的基础上，使工业和农业都以高度技术扩大再生产和出产日益丰富的工业品和农产品，才建成了社会主义社会，才有条件准备过渡到人类最高理想——共产主义社会去。
