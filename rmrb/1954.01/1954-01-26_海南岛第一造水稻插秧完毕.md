    In Wanning, Qiongdong, Lehui, and other counties on Hainan Island, where it is spring all year round, the transplanting of the first season of rice has been completed, and most of the seedlings have now become a green expanse. After publicizing the general line, the enthusiasm of farmers in the Hainan Island area for production has been further enhanced. This year, transplanting was generally completed half a month earlier than in previous years, which will allow the second season of rice to be harvested before the typhoon season. Farmers are also cultivating more carefully than before, and are now working on mid-season hoeing and weeding. Many places that used to only weed and fertilize once have now set out plans to weed and fertilize three times.

    海南岛第一造水稻插秧完毕
    四季皆春的海南岛上的万宁、琼东、乐会等县，第一造水稻已插秧完毕，现大部秧苗已成一片绿茵。海南岛地区经过宣传总路线，农民生产积极性进一步提高，今年一般比往年提早半个月完成插秧，这样可使第二造水稻赶在台风季节前收割。农民耕作一般也比以前精细，现正着手中耕除草。许多过去只除草施肥各一次的地方，现在都已订出除草施肥三次的计划。（新华社）
