Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 5th: The first modern textile machinery manufacturing plant in our country, the state-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, comprehensively completed its construction tasks on the last day of 1953. At the same time, it began trial manufacturing of a small quantity of 10,000-spindle textile machinery. From now on, this factory will produce new-style spinning machinery to equip the newly built spinning mills in our country.

The Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory was built in our country while concentrating efforts on developing heavy industry and correspondingly developing light industry. This factory is large in scale, including main production workshops such as casting, forging, and metalworking, as well as auxiliary workshops such as tools, machine tools, electromechanical, and wood processing. Each workshop is equipped with modern production equipment. After the entire factory is put into production, its annual output, calculated on a one-shift basis, can produce equipment for 200,000 spindles.

The Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory is located near the heavy industrial area of ​​Taiyuan, and can obtain sufficient raw material supplies of steel, electricity, and coal. It is also located in the center of cotton-producing areas such as Shaanxi and Hebei and new textile industrial areas in our country. Its products can be continuously transported to these areas through the Zhengtai Railway and the Tongpu Railway. After the completion of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, the original textile machinery manufacturing plants in our country may be able to produce a certain number of silk, wool, and linen weaving machines in the next few years. In this way, it is guaranteed that the people of our country will not only be able to obtain more yarn and cloth in the future, but also more industrial products such as wool, silk, and linen fabrics.

Since the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory began construction in May 1951, the thousands of workers participating in the construction have actively learned from advanced Soviet experience and brought into play a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in their work. They overcame many difficulties in terms of manpower, materials, and technology. In two years and seven months, they built a grand factory building on 3,100 mu of land, installed all the machinery and equipment, built spacious and beautiful office buildings, a well-equipped employee hospital, a large number of employee dormitories, and various other ancillary buildings. During the construction process, the factory also completed the trial production of a spinning machine and trained enough technical workers to meet production needs, thereby ensuring that it could be put into production in a timely manner after the completion of the construction task.

    经纬纺织机械制造厂全面完工
   【新华社太原五日电】我国第一座现代化纺织机械制造厂——国营经纬纺织机械制造厂，已在一九五三年最后一天全面完成建设任务，同时开始了一万纱锭纺织机械的小量试造工作。从此该厂将生产新式纺纱机械，装备我国新建的纺纱厂。
    经纬纺织机械制造厂是我国在集中力量发展重工业同时，为相应发展轻工业建设起来的。这个工厂规模宏大，包括有铸工、锻工、金工等主要生产车间和工具、工具机、机电和木材处理等辅助车间。各车间都装备着现代化的生产设备。全厂投入生产后，年产量以一班计算，就可以生产二十万纱锭的设备。
    经纬纺织机械制造厂临近太原重工业地区，可以得到充足的钢材、电力、煤炭的原料供应。它又位于我国内地陕西、河北等产棉区和新的纺织工业区的中心，产品可以通过正太铁路、同蒲铁路源源运往这些地区去。经纬纺织机械制造厂建成后，我国原有的纺织机械制造厂就可能在今后数年内生产一定数量的丝织、毛织和麻织机器。这样，就保证了我国人民今后不仅可以得到更多的纱布，而且也可以得到更多的毛织、丝织和麻织等工业产品。
    经纬纺织机械制造厂从一九五一年五月开始建厂以来，参加建厂的几千名职工积极学习苏联先进经验，并在工作中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，克服了人力、物力和技术方面的许多困难，在两年零七个月的时间里，就在三千一百亩广阔的土地上建筑起了宏大的厂房，安好了全部机器设备，修起了宽敞美丽的办公楼、设备完善的职工医院和大批的职工宿舍，以及其它各种附属建筑。在建厂过程中，该厂还完成了一台纺纱机械的试制工作，训练了足够生产需要的技术工人，因而保证了在建厂任务完成后，能够及时投入生产。
