    Ethnic Work in the Central South Region Over the Past Four Years
    Central South Administrative Council Ethnic Affairs Committee

    In the four years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central South Region has implemented ethnic regional autonomy in minority areas, completed land reform in major agricultural areas inhabited by minorities, launched patriotic production increase campaigns, and carried out financial, economic, cultural, educational, and health work. This has strengthened ethnic unity, raised the political awareness of all ethnic groups, and initially improved people's lives. Regions that have undergone various reform movements (most of the minority areas in the Central South Region) are now in a period of gradually transitioning to socialist society. Here is a general report on the work of the past, for reference by various regions.

      Work on Ethnic Regional Autonomy

    Since liberation, through various work efforts and mass movements, social order in minority areas has gradually stabilized, ethnic relations have been fundamentally improved, and a large number of ethnic minority cadres and activists have emerged. Farmers' associations, women's associations, and militia organizations have been established. Local people's governments have convened three to five sessions of people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups, inspiring the minority people's desire to be "masters of their own house" and creating a good foundation for promoting the policy of ethnic regional autonomy.

    The Central South Region began to vigorously and universally promote ethnic regional autonomy in the second half of 1951. To date, sixteen ethnic autonomous areas at or above the district level have been established, including the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (equivalent to an administrative office level), the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region and the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region (equivalent to a prefecture level), and the Dayaoshan Yao Autonomous Region, the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous Region, the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region, the Liannan Yao Autonomous Region, the Longlin Various Ethnic Groups United Autonomous Region, and the Longsheng Various Ethnic Groups United Autonomous Region (equivalent to a county level). In addition, there are seven autonomous areas equivalent to a district level and more than thirty autonomous areas equivalent to a township level. The Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Li, Dong, and Hui ethnic groups have established autonomous areas, totaling 6,464,800 people, accounting for approximately 73% of the total minority population in the region. Currently, only individual counties and small concentrated areas below the county level have not yet established autonomous areas.

    The policy of ethnic regional autonomy has been warmly welcomed by all ethnic groups. After the establishment of autonomous areas, the labor enthusiasm and patriotism of minority people have generally increased, and economic and cultural undertakings have begun to develop in various minority areas. The autonomous area governments have established closer ties with the masses.

    The establishment of ethnic autonomous areas has simultaneously provided a vivid education in ethnic policies for the Han and other ethnic groups within the autonomous areas, further promoting ethnic unity. For example, after the establishment of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, the Miao and Han people, who were originally hostile and suspicious of each other, have become close. Near Jishou Town, a Miao child fell into the water in winter, and nearby Han farmers immediately jumped into the water to rescue him, changed him into dry clothes, and took care of him until the child's parents took him back. Many such examples of ethnic unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation have appeared in various ethnic autonomous areas.

    The ethnic representation in the autonomous organs of the ethnic autonomous areas has a preliminary foundation. Currently, there are more than 30,000 minority cadres in the entire Central South Region. Most of the district and township government cadres in the autonomous areas are local minority cadres. In the autonomous area government organs at the county level and above, in addition to the main leaders of the autonomous area being minority cadres, minority cadres generally also occupy a considerable proportion in the work departments.

    The more prominent issues that need to be further resolved are how to help autonomous areas more fully exercise their due autonomous rights and how to specifically resolve the issue of minority cadres having both authority and responsibility in all aspects. In this regard, there are still shortcomings. For example, some higher-level organs directly assign generalized tasks to the counties under the autonomous areas without going through the autonomous area government, ignoring the characteristics of minority areas and causing passivity in the work of the autonomous areas. In individual areas, minority cadres are still not respected enough. For example, minority cadres in one county have been idle in the organs. This situation must be changed quickly.

      Economic Work

    In this area, the main efforts over the past four years have been a series of work efforts to relieve poverty and support production, enabling minority nationalities to get rid of the extreme poverty left over from history as quickly as possible, overcome disasters, and initially change their backward state of production. In 1950, the People's Government allocated approximately 50,000 pieces of clothing, over 5.24 million catties of relief grain, and over 1.5 billion yuan in relief funds to minority nationalities in Hainan. In 1951, the entire Central South Region allocated a total of 6 million catties of relief grain, in 1952, 2,896,000 catties of relief grain, and over 15.288 billion yuan in relief funds. Resettlement funds alone amounted to 8.9 billion yuan in 1953. At the same time, leadership and assistance were provided to minority nationalities in increasing and replenishing farming cattle and farm implements, improving farming techniques, organizing agricultural production mutual aid teams (some areas organized minority farmers' visiting groups to visit and study in advanced agricultural production areas and mutual aid teams), preventing floods and droughts; and establishing and supplementing state-owned trade organizations, cooperatives, and banks, expanding the circulation of goods that are of great significance to the lives and production of minority nationalities, and other economic work. In particular, since 1952, the increase in the allocation of huge special financial funds to minority areas has been of more practical significance in helping to solve the difficulties of minority nationalities in production and life.

    Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the area of cultivated land in minority areas in the Central South Region has gradually expanded, and agricultural productivity has gradually improved. According to statistics, the area reclaimed by minority nationalities in Guangxi Province in 1952 reached more than 1.63 million mu. In the same year, except for severely affected areas, yields generally increased by 10% to 15%. Last year, the 85.8 billion yuan in agricultural loans issued by banks at all levels in Guangxi to minority areas helped farmers of all ethnic groups buy more than 65,900 head of cattle, more than 540,000 farm implements, and more than 60,000 dan of seeds. According to incomplete statistics, in the minority areas of Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces, more than 1 million mu of farmland have benefited from the construction and restoration of various water conservancy projects. The area of large and small water conservancy irrigation built and restored in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region after liberation accounts for 27% of the total area of paddy fields in the autonomous region. Therefore, the output has increased year by year. For example, the rice output in 1950 increased by 9% compared with 1949, in 1951 it increased by 11% compared with 1950, and in 1952 it increased by 15% compared with 1951. Before liberation, the people of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region had no habits of accumulating or applying fertilizer, no methods of intertillage or weeding, and no knowledge of pest control, seed selection, or water conservancy construction, resulting in extremely low yields. After liberation, under the strong leadership and assistance of the People's Government, agricultural production techniques were improved, and more than 104,000 farm implements and more than 9,000 head of cattle were purchased, which began to increase agricultural productivity and greatly increased the yield per unit area. In the autumn harvest of 1952, the entire region increased grain production by more than 849,000 dan.

    The People's Government has helped the development of forestry production in minority areas. For example, in the Sanjiang Dong area of Guangxi, Jianghua, Tongdao, Dongkou, and Chengbu in Hunan, and Liannan Yao area in Guangdong, work has been carried out in a planned manner to thin out timber, protect forests, and develop economic forests. According to incomplete statistics, Sanjiang County shipped out more than 160,000 railway sleepers, lumber, and wood tails from January to September 1951. In the same year, more than 12,000 mu of afforestation were carried out in Liannan County. In 1952, the government invested in afforestation in 242,000 mu of minority forestry areas in Guangxi, and public-private joint afforestation of 13,000 mu of fir forests in Liannan Yao area. In 1953, another 41,000 mu of afforestation were carried out in Liannan Yao area. The timber production in the entire Central South minority area has been increasing year by year, and in 1953 it increased more than twofold compared with 1952.

    The development of state-owned trade organizations and cooperative commerce has expanded the circulation of commodities between urban and rural areas and between regions, changing the exploitative price differences that existed in trade with minority areas in history. The purchasing power of minority nationalities has increased. Currently, 337 state-owned trade organizations (including trading companies, retail stores, and trading groups) and 470 cooperatives have been successively established in minority areas in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces. In 1952, the total value of purchases by state-owned trade organizations in minority areas in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces was 195.4 billion yuan, and the total value of sales reached 231.6 billion yuan. The establishment and expansion of state-owned and cooperative commerce has reasonably adjusted the prices of local specialties, narrowed the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products, and cracked down on unscrupulous merchants who have always been engaged in deception and exploitation of minority nationalities. For example, in Baojing County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, before liberation, eight catties of rice were required to exchange for one catty of salt. In 1951, only two catties of rice were required to exchange for one catty of salt. Before liberation, 300 catties of tung oil were required to exchange for one bolt of Longtou cloth in Guzhang County, Xiangxi. Now, only 167 catties of tung oil are required to exchange for one bolt of Longtou cloth.

    The development of banking institutions has helped minority nationalities solve many difficulties in production and life. For example, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has a branch of the People's Bank, and each county has a sub-branch. There are 368 business offices and work teams of the People's Bank in the entire autonomous region, accounting for more than 80% of the number of districts and towns in the region. According to statistics, the cumulative amount of loans specifically granted to minority nationalities in the entire Central South Region over the past four years is more than 230 billion yuan (general agricultural loans are not included).

    In the minority areas of Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan provinces, 7,212 kilometers of roads have been newly built, improved, restored, and surveyed (excluding the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region), and another 164 kilometers of mountain roads have been newly built. The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region has completed the telephone network from the capital of the autonomous region to Haikou and the counties of the autonomous region, which directly contributes to the development of political, economic, and cultural undertakings in minority areas.

    The above series of measures has initially improved the lives of minority nationalities. According to a typical survey in Banbai Township, a Miao-populated area in Baojing County, Xiangxi, the per capita annual grain consumption of local Miao farmers in 1952 increased by 36.67% compared with before liberation. The consumption of edible salt increased by 15% in 1951 compared with 1950, and by another 19% in 1952 compared with 1951.

    In terms of financial and economic work, the problems that must be solved and the shortcomings that should be overcome are, first and foremost, that some past work was not well integrated with the ethnic policies and characteristics of minority areas. Some mechanically applied the practices of Han areas to minority areas. For example, the issue of the autonomous area becoming a first-level finance encountered many comrades who rigidly applied the three-level financial system and delayed it for a year without resolving it. Furthermore, regarding the mountain and forest issue, there was a neglect of the characteristic that mountains and forests in minority areas are an individual small commodity economy, neglecting the production and life of the masses, blindly expanding the scope of state-owned forests, and one-sidedly and excessively emphasizing closing mountains for afforestation. Secondly, financial and economic work in minority areas is rarely included in the plans of business departments. In addition to the reason that basic economic conditions in minority areas are not well known or specific, there is also a tendency to disregard ethnic issues, which should be quickly corrected.

      Cultural, Educational, and Health Work

    The People's Government has made every effort to meet the growing demand of minority nationalities to learn culture as they have politically and economically turned over. The number of schools and students in minority areas has increased over the years. For example, in the Yao and Miao areas of Guangxi Province, there were only 230 specialized primary schools with 6,900 students in 1950. In 1951, the number of schools increased by 80%, and the number of students increased by 2.3 times. By the second half of 1952, the number of schools had increased to 4.51 times that of 1950, and the number of students had increased to 8.3 times that of 1950. As of the first half of 1953, the entire Central South Region had 13,609 specialized ethnic primary schools, 2,171 primary schools that also admitted minority nationalities, 3 specialized middle schools, 288 middle schools that also admitted minority nationalities, 4 specialized ethnic normal schools, and 101 normal schools that also admitted minority nationalities. There were a total of 1,020,892 primary school students, 34,605 middle school students, and 2,135 secondary normal school students from minority nationalities. In addition to allocating general educational funds, the People's Government also allocated a batch of special subsidies for minority education every year. For example, 2 billion yuan was allocated in 1951, 5.8 billion yuan was allocated in 1952, and 18.5 billion yuan was allocated in 1953. This subsidy made it possible for school education to gradually develop.

    After liberation, the number of winter schools, night schools, and literacy classes in minority areas in Central South China, which met the learning requirements of adults, also increased year by year. In 1950, land reform was generally not carried out in minority areas, and farmers rarely participated in spare-time learning. However, after the winter of 1951, it became more common. At the end of 1952, the number of students in night schools in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region reached 9,691, and in 1953 it increased by 2,937.

    Cultural work in minority areas has also made certain progress. For example, each county in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region has a Xinhua Bookstore and has established cultural centers, cultural stations, and radio stations. Many rural areas have also established libraries, mobile library reading groups, and reading clubs. A total of 1,359 newspaper reading groups and 100 slide projection teams were organized in the entire region. The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region has a dedicated mobile film team, and the Hunan Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau has also specially dispatched three film education work teams to conduct mobile screenings in the autonomous region for a long time. In addition, the Central South has established an ethnic song and dance troupe to promote ethnic policies and often tours various minority areas, having performed 73 shows in major cities and minority areas, with a total audience of more than 300,000 people.

    Before liberation, epidemics were rampant in minority areas in Central South China. In some areas, malaria patients often accounted for 70% to 90% of the total population during the epidemic season. Maternal and child health facilities were also extremely lacking, and infant mortality rates were extremely high. According to estimates from the second village of Dunren Township, District 3, Fenghuang County, Xiangxi, in the two years before liberation, the number of infant deaths accounted for more than 70% of the number of infant births during the same period. These situations seriously affected the health and population growth of minority nationalities. After liberation, the People's Government first began to restore, build, and supplement health and medical institutions in minority areas. Now, health centers or clinics have been established in minority counties and key areas of counties. Some counties have also established branch hospitals of health centers or other comprehensive hospitals. In total, there are currently 292 county health centers, 1,945 district health clinics, 4 ethnic hospitals, and 3 ethnic health work teams in minority areas in Central South China. The People's Government allocates a large amount of special subsidies for health every year, totaling 16.906 billion yuan in 1952 and 23.447 billion yuan in 1953. These special funds have played a great role in the development of health undertakings in minority areas.

    In order to systematically eradicate the diseases prevalent in minority areas, the People's Government has also vigorously launched prevention work. Specialized prevention or treatment institutions have been established in areas where various epidemics are prevalent, such as malaria prevention and treatment stations and venereal disease prevention and treatment teams. Most counties have established epidemic prevention committees. In 1952, the number of people vaccinated against cowpox in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region reached more than 220,000, accounting for more than 85% of the population of the entire autonomous region. In 1953, a total of more than 100,000 adults and newborns were revaccinated. In the spring and autumn of 1952, the number of people vaccinated in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region reached more than 620,000, and the number of people receiving preventive injections reached more than 180,000. This has greatly reduced diseases such as malaria, smallpox, typhoid, and dysentery prevalent in minority areas. In terms of maternal and child health, due to the training and transformation of midwives and the promotion of new delivery methods, many villages have established delivery stations, and infant mortality rates have been rapidly reduced. According to a survey in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, only one out of 135 newborns died during the delivery process.

    Health institutions in various places have provided minority nationalities with the maximum amount of free medical care. For example, patients in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region received free treatment more than 170,000 times in the first half of 1953 alone, and the number of people hospitalized for free also reached 3,345.

    The development of cultural, educational, and health work has been rapid in the past four years, and great achievements have been made, but the quantity is large and the quality is not strong, the planning is also poor, and the ethnic policy education for cultural and educational workers is also insufficient. These shortcomings still need to be gradually corrected in future work.

      Ethnic Unity Work

    For the past four years, we have implemented a basic spirit in all our work, which is to strengthen and consolidate ethnic unity. Ethnic unity is the most important key and powerful guarantee for carrying out other work. Therefore, in addition to paying attention to implementing ethnic unity policies in general work, we have also conducted some ethnic visits and organized minority nationalities to visit and attend ceremonies in Beijing with the main purpose of strengthening ethnic unity, and conducted some work to publicize and educate ethnic policies and inspect the implementation of ethnic policies with the main purpose of consolidating ethnic unity. In order to expand the influence of ethnic policy propaganda and education, we also held a large-scale Central South China Minority Cultural Relics and Picture Exhibition.

    The visits to minority nationalities have been carried out with great fanfare. For example, various forums, mass meetings, and song and dance performances, film screenings, medical activities, and the granting of large quantities of practical and politically significant gifts have been used to expand political influence. The Central South Visiting Group to Henan further combined inspection work to discover problems and solved them in a timely manner, educating cadres and the masses. Some visiting groups were themselves work teams at the same time, assisting in the establishment of ethnic autonomous areas in the places they visited.

    In the spring of 1953, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, and in conjunction with the study of ethnic policies, an inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies was carried out throughout the region. Various places successively organized inspection groups, visiting groups, inspection teams, investigation teams, and used methods such as forums to conduct in-depth inspection work. As a result, it was found that in the past, especially in the early stages of the development of ethnic work, the phenomenon of not paying attention to ethnic work existed to varying degrees from the relevant departments of Central South China to local governments at all levels. It was found that some regions and business departments did not proceed from the characteristics and current situation of ethnic groups when handling ethnic work, mechanically using the experience of Han areas, and the work was generalized. It was found that some Han cadres still have Han chauvinistic ideas or their ideological remnants, and do not respect the customs and religious beliefs of minority nationalities. However, these shortcomings and mistakes have been vigorously overcome and corrected after the inspection, and serious measures have been taken to deal with major problems, reversing the bad influence and strengthening ethnic unity. Since the shortcomings in ethnic work are mostly caused by ideological roots that are difficult to completely eliminate—Han chauvinism—the relevant departments and local governments must conduct regular supervision and inspection, correct errors in a timely manner, criticize ideas, strengthen education, correct work styles, and regard supervision and inspection as a regular task to ensure that ethnic work is carried out on the correct track.

    中南区四年来的民族工作
    中南行政委员会民族事务委员会
    中华人民共和国成立后的四年中，中南区少数民族地区推行了民族区域自治，完成了少数民族主要农业地区的土地改革，开展了爱国增产运动，以及财经、文教、卫生等工作，加强了民族团结，提高了各族人民的政治觉悟，初步改善了人民生活。在经过了各项改革运动的地区（占中南区少数民族地区的大部分）目前正处于逐步过渡到社会主义社会的时期。这里概括地报道一下过去的工作，供各地参考。
      民族区域自治工作
    解放以后，经过各项工作与群众运动，各少数民族地区的社会秩序先后趋于安定，民族关系得到基本改善，涌现了不少的民族干部和积极分子，建立了农会、妇女会和民兵等组织，各地人民政府都召开了三次至五次的各族各界人民代表会议，启发了少数民族人民“当家作主”的要求，为推行民族区域自治政策创造了良好的基础。
    中南区从一九五一年下半年开始，着手大力普遍展开推行民族区域自治工作，至现在止，已建立了十六个相当于区级以上的民族自治区，其中有相当于行署级的桂西僮族自治区，相当于专区级的湘西苗族自治区和海南黎族苗族自治区，相当于县级的大瑶山瑶族自治区、大苗山苗族自治区、三江侗族自治区、连南瑶族自治区、隆林各族联合自治区、龙胜各族联合自治区，此外尚有相当于区级的自治区七个，相当于乡级的自治区三十余个。已建立了民族自治区的有僮、瑶、苗、黎、侗、回几个民族，共六百四十六万四千八百余人，约占全区少数民族人口总数的百分之七十三。现在尚未建立自治区的，仅为个别县及县以下的小块聚居区。
    民族区域自治政策受到各族人民热烈的欢迎。自治区建立以后，少数民族人民的劳动热情和爱国主义思想普遍提高，开始开展了各少数民族地区的经济、文化事业。自治区人民政府与群众已建立了较密切的联系。
    民族自治区的建立，对自治区内汉族及其他民族人民同时进行了一次生动的民族政策教育，更加促进了民族团结。如湘西苗族自治区成立后，使原来互相仇视与猜疑的苗汉两族的人民变得亲密起来了。在吉首镇附近，有一个苗族小孩子在冬天掉下了水，立刻就有附近的汉族农民跳下水去救了起来，给小孩子换上了干衣服，悉心照顾，一直等小孩子的父母领了回去。这类民族团结互助合作的事例，在各民族自治区都出现了很多。
    民族自治区自治机关的民族化工作，已有了初步的基础。现在全中南区共有少数民族干部三万人以上。自治区的区乡政权干部，大部分都是当地少数民族干部，县级以及县级以上的自治区政权机关，除自治区主要负责人系少数民族干部外，工作部门少数民族干部一般也占有相当比例。
    当前比较突出而需要进一步具体解决的问题，是如何帮助自治区更充分地行使其应有的自治权利，及从各方面具体解决少数民族干部有职有权的问题。在这方面，目前还存在着缺点，如有的上级机关不通过自治区人民政府，直接向其自治区所属的县布置一般化的工作，忽视了少数民族地区的特点，造成了自治区工作上的被动。个别地区对少数民族干部仍不够尊重，如曾经有个县的少数民族干部一直在机关里闲住着。这种情况必须迅速改变。
      经济工作
    四年来在这方面主要是进行了一系列救济贫困、扶助生产的工作，使少数民族尽可能迅速地摆脱历史上遗留下来的极端贫困和克服灾荒，初步改变其生产落后的状态。人民政府在一九五○年拨发给海南少数民族救济衣服约五万件，救济粮五百二十四万多斤，救济款十五亿元以上；一九五一年全中南区共拨救济粮六百万斤，一九五二年拨救济粮二百八十九万六千多斤，救济款一百五十二亿八千多万元；一九五三年拨救济款五百四十三亿二千五百万元。移民费仅一九五三年即拨八十九亿元。同时领导和帮助少数民族进行增补耕牛农具、改进耕作技术、组织农业生产互助组（有些地区曾组织少数民族农民参观团分别到先进农业生产地区和互助组进行参观与学习）、防水防旱；并建立与充实国营贸易机构、合作社、银行，扩大对少数民族人民生活、生产具有重要意义的商品的流转等等经济工作。特别是从一九五二年起增加拨给少数民族地区庞大的财经专款，对帮助解决少数民族生产和生活上的困难，更具现实意义。
    在党与人民政府领导下，中南少数民族地区耕地面积逐渐扩大，农业生产力逐步提高。据统计，广西省少数民族一九五二年开荒达一百六十三万余亩。同年，除重灾区外，一般能增产一成至一成五。去年广西各级银行发放的八百五十八亿给少数民族地区的农贷，就帮助各族农民买到耕牛六万五千九百多头，农具五十四万多件，种子六万多担……。又据不完全材料统计，在湖南、广东、广西三省少数民族地区因兴建和恢复各种水利工程而受益的田亩在一百万亩以上。湘西苗族自治区解放后兴建与恢复的大小型水利灌溉面积占该自治区稻田总面积的百分之二十七，因而产量逐年递增，如一九五○年稻谷产量较一九四九年增产百分之九，一九五一年较一九五○年又增产百分之十一，一九五二年又比一九五一年增产百分之十五。海南黎族苗族自治区人民在解放前无积肥、施肥、中耕、除草的习惯，又不知除虫选种和兴修水利，产量极低。解放后在人民政府的大力领导和帮助下，改进了农业生产技术，并已添购了十万四千多件农具和九千多头耕牛，开始提高了农业生产力，大大提高了单位面积产量，一九五二年秋收，全区即增产粮食八十四万九千多市担。
    人民政府帮助了少数民族地区林业生产的发展。如在广西三江侗族地区，湖南江华、通道、洞口、城步与广东连南瑶族等地区，曾有计划地进行疏销木材、培护森林和发展经济林木的工作。据不完全的材料统计，一九五一年一至九月三江县就运出了枕木、条木、尾木共十六万余根。同年在连南县造林一万二千余亩；一九五二年又在广西少数民族林业地区由政府投资造林二十四万二千余亩，在连南瑶族地区公私合营造杉林一万三千余亩；一九五三年在连南瑶族地区又造林四万一千余亩。全中南少数民族地区的木材生产量，已在逐年增加，一九五三年即比一九五二年增产两倍多。
    国营贸易机构与合作社商业的发展，扩大了城乡间和地区间的商品流转，改变了历史上对少数民族地区进行贸易所存在的掠夺性的差价。少数民族人民的购买力已有提高。目前在广东、广西、湖南三省少数民族地区已陆续建立了国营贸易机构三百三十七组（包括贸易公司、门市部商店及贸易小组等），合作社四百七十个。国营贸易机构一九五二年内在广东、广西、湖南三省少数民族地区收购总值为一千九百五十四亿元，销货总值达二千三百一十六亿元。国营和合作社商业的建立与扩大，合理地调整了土特产的价格，缩小了工业品与农产品之间的剪刀差，打击了过去一贯对少数民族进行欺骗掠夺的奸商。如湘西苗族自治区保靖县解放前要八斤米才能换到一斤盐，一九五一年时只需两斤米就可换到一斤盐了。湘西古丈县解放前要三百斤桐油才能换一匹龙头布，现在只要一六七斤桐油就可以换一匹龙头布了。
    银行机构的发展，帮助少数民族解决了许多生产和生活上的困难。如桂西僮族自治区设有人民银行分行，每县设有支行，全自治区的人民银行营业所和工作组就有三百六十八个，占全区的区镇数百分之八十以上。全中南区专门贷给少数民族的贷款，据统计四年来累计有二千三百多亿（一般农贷中的照顾尚不在内）。
    在广西、广东、湖南三省少数民族地区，新建、改善、恢复和测设公路七千二百十二公里（不包括海南黎族苗族自治区），另新建山区大道一百六十四公里。海南黎族苗族自治区完成了从自治区首府到海口及自治区各县的电话网，这些都直接有助于少数民族地区政治、经济、文化事业的发展。
    以上一系列的措施，初步改善了少数民族人民的生活。据湘西保靖县苗族聚居区半白乡的典型调查，当地苗族农民一九五二年每人每年粮食的消费量比解放前增加了百分之三六点六七，食盐消费量一九五一年较一九五○年增加百分之十五，一九五二年又比一九五一年增加了百分之十九。
    在财经工作方面，目前必须解决的问题和应克服的缺点，首先是过去有些工作没有很好结合民族政策与少数民族地区的特点进行。有的机械地把汉族地区的做法套用到少数民族地区。例如：对自治区成为一级财政的问题，就碰到不少同志硬套三级财政体制，拖延一年之久未予解决。再如关于山林问题，亦曾有过忽略少数民族地区山林是个体小商品经济这一特点，忽略了群众的生产和生活，盲目地扩大国有林范围，片面地、过分地强调封山育林。其次，少数民族地区的财经工作还很少列入业务部门的计划。这儿除了对少数民族地区经济上的基本情况还知道得不多不具体这一原因外，还存在着漠视民族问题的倾向，应迅速纠正。
      文教卫生工作
    人民政府尽力满足少数民族人民因政治、经济上得到翻身而日见高涨的学习文化的要求。少数民族地区的学校数量和学生数量历年均有增加。如广西省瑶、苗两族地区，一九五○年仅有专设小学二百三十所，学生六千九百人；一九五一年，学校数增加了百分之八十，学生人数增加了二点三倍。到一九五二年下半年，学校数目已增至一九五○年的四点五一倍，学生人数增至一九五○年的八点三倍。截至一九五三年上半年止，全中南区有专设的民族小学一万三千六百零九所，兼收少数民族的小学二千一百七十一所，专设的中学三所，兼收少数民族的中学二百八十八所，专设的民族师范学校四所，兼收少数民族的师范学校一百零一所，共计有少数民族的小学生一百零二万八百九十二人，中学生三万四千六百零五人，中等师范学生二千一百三十五人。人民政府除拨发一般的教育事业费外，每年还拨给一批少数民族教育特殊补助费。如一九五一年拨发二十亿元，一九五二年拨发五十八亿元，一九五三年拨发了一百八十五亿元。这种补助，使学校教育有了逐步发展的可能
    中南少数民族地区解放后各种满足成年人学习要求的冬学、夜校、识字班，也逐年增加。一九五○年，少数民族地区一般还未进行土地改革，农民很少参加业余学习；但至一九五一年冬以后就开始普遍地多起来了。海南黎族苗族自治区在一九五二年底，夜校人数发展至九千六百九十一人，一九五三年增加了二千九百三十七人。
    少数民族地区的文化工作也有一定的开展。如湘西苗族自治区各县都设有新华书店，建立了文化馆、文化站、收音站。很多农村还建立了图书室、图书流动传递阅览组和读书会。全区共组织了一千三百五十九个读报组，一百队幻灯放映队。海南黎族苗族自治区专设了巡回电影队一队，湖南省文化事业管理局还专门派有电影教育工作队三个分队，长期在自治区内作巡回放映。此外，中南已成立民族歌舞团，配合民族政策宣传，经常赴各少数民族地区巡回演出，计已在大的城市和少数民族地区演出七十三场，观众共达三十余万人。
    解放前，中南少数民族地区疫病长期流行，有些地区疟疾患者在流行季节常达全人口的百分之七十至九十。妇婴卫生设施也极缺乏，婴儿死亡率极高。据湘西凤凰县三区敦仁乡第二村解放前两年的估计，婴儿死亡数占同期婴儿出生数的百分之七十以上。这些情况，严重地影响了少数民族人民的健康及人口的生长。解放后人民政府首先着手在少数民族地区恢复、新建和充实卫生医疗机构，现在少数民族的县和县的重点区均建立了卫生院或卫生所，有的县还设置了卫生院的分院或其他综合性的医院。总计目前中南少数民族地区有县卫生院二九二所，区卫生所一九四五个，民族医院四所，民族卫生工作队三队。人民政府每年拨发大批卫生补助专款，计一九五二年拨发一百六十九亿零六百万元，一九五三年拨发二百三十四亿四千七百万元，这些专款对少数民族地区卫生事业的发展起了极大的作用。
    为了有步骤地根绝少数民族地区流行的疾病，人民政府还大力展开了预防工作。在各种疫病流行的地区均设立了专门性的预防或治疗机构，如疟疾防治站、性病防治队等。各县大都成立了防疫委员会。海南黎族苗族自治区一九五二年种牛痘的人数达二十二万多人，占全自治区人口百分之八十五以上，一九五三年继续补种的成人和初生婴儿共达十万多人。湘西苗族自治区在一九五二年春秋两季，种痘人数达六十二万多人，受到防疫注射的人数达十八万多人。这样就使流行在少数民族地区的疟疾、天花、伤寒、痢疾等病大为减少。妇幼卫生方面，由于培养和改造了接生人员，推广了新接生法，很多的村寨建立了接生站，婴儿死亡率已迅速降低。据海南黎族苗族自治区调查，一百三十五个出生婴儿在生产过程中死亡的只有一个。
    各地卫生机构对少数民族人民都进行了最大限度的免费医疗。如海南黎族苗族自治区的病人仅一九五三年上半年就得到免费治疗十七万多次，免费住院的人数亦达三千三百四十五人。
    文教卫生工作四年来的发展很快，有了很大的成绩，但数量大而质量不强，计划性也差些，对文教工作人员的民族政策教育也不够。这些缺点还需要在今后工作中逐步改正。
      民族团结工作
    四年来我们的一切工作中都贯彻了一项基本精神，就是加强与巩固民族团结。民族团结是开展其他工作的最重要关键与有力保证。因此，我们除在一般工作中注意贯彻民族团结政策外，还特别进行了一些以加强民族团结为主要目的的民族访问和组织少数民族参观与赴京观礼工作，进行了一些以巩固民族团结为主要目的的民族政策宣传教育和民族政策执行情况检查的工作。为了扩大民族政策宣传教育的影响，还举办了一次规模较大的中南区少数民族文物图片展览会。
    历次对少数民族的访问工作，都是大张旗鼓地进行的。如召开各种座谈会、群众大会和通过歌舞演出、电影放映、医疗活动，以及大量赠予切合实用和有政治意义的礼品等，以扩大政治影响。访问河南的中南访问团还进一步结合检查工作发现了问题，及时作了解决，教育了干部与群众。有的访问团本身同时就是工作队，在访问所到的地方，协助建立民族自治区。
    一九五三年春季，根据中央指示，结合民族政策学习，进行了一次全区民族政策执行情况的检查。各地先后分别组织了检查团、访问团、检查组、调查组和采用座谈会等方式，深入进行检查工作。结果检查出过去，特别是民族工作开展的初期，从中南各有关部门到各级地方政府都或多或少地存在着不重视民族工作的现象；检查出有些地区和业务部门在处理民族工作时，不从民族的特点和现状出发，机械搬用汉区经验，工作一般化；检查出某些汉族干部还存在着大汉族主义的思想或其思想残余，不够尊重少数民族的风俗习惯与宗教信仰，等等。但这些缺点与错误在检查后都已大力克服与纠正，对重大问题已分别作了严肃处理，挽回了不好的影响，加强了民族团结。由于民族工作中的缺点多半导源于难于立即完全消灭的思想根源——大汉族主义，各有关部门和有关地方政府今后必须经常进行督促检查，及时纠正错误，批判思想，加强教育，端正作风，把督促检查当作保证民族工作在正确轨道上进行的经常工作。
