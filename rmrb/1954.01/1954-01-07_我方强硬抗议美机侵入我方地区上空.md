Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th—Colonel Zhu Ran, Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, strongly protested at today's meeting of secretaries against the provocative incident of US military aircraft seriously violating the armistice agreement and intruding into our airspace. The US side, with a large formation of eight jet aircraft, penetrated deep into our airspace twice. Colonel Zhu Ran pointed out that from the time the armistice agreement went into effect until the end of December 1953, according to incomplete statistics, US military aircraft violated the armistice agreement and intruded into our airspace and coastal airspace in as many as 136 batches totaling 302 sorties. Our side has repeatedly raised these continuous violations of the armistice agreement by the US side at the Military Armistice Commission and meetings of secretaries, but the US side has not only failed to stop such behavior, but has instead intensified it, even sending large formations of military aircraft deep into our airspace, recklessly carrying out provocative activities. Colonel Zhu Ran emphasized that the US side must bear full responsibility for all serious consequences arising from these violations of the armistice agreement by the US side.
    The two violations of the armistice agreement by the US side raised by Colonel Zhu Ran, Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side today, are as follows: At approximately 13:20 on December 30, 1953, a formation of eight US military jet aircraft intruded from the south into our airspace near Jiaodao, Hanchuan, and Fengchuandong, and then flew south. At approximately 13:39 on the same day, a formation of eight US military jet aircraft intruded from the south into our airspace over Lishi-ri at the mouth of the Qingchuan River, circling for about three minutes, and then flew west via our airspace over Changyuan and Mengjinpu-ri.

    我方强硬抗议美机侵入我方地区上空
   【新华社开城六日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面秘书长朱然上校，今天在双方秘书长会议上强硬抗议美方军用飞机严重破坏停战协定、侵入我方地区上空的挑衅事件，美方以八架喷气式飞机的大编队两次深入我方地区上空。朱然上校指出：自停战协定生效起到一九五三年十二月底止，美方军用飞机违反停战协定侵入我方地区及沿海上空事件，据不完全统计已达一百三十六批三百零二架次之多。我方对美方这种不断违反停战协定事件曾在军事停战委员会及双方秘书长会议上屡次向美方提出，但美方非但没有停止此类行为，反而变本加厉，竟以大编队的军用飞机深入我方地区上空，肆无忌惮地进行挑衅活动。朱然上校着重指出：由于美方这些破坏停战协定事件而产生的一切严重后果，美方必须担负全部责任。
    朝中方面秘书长朱然上校今天提出的两次美方违反停战协定事件如下：一九五三年十二月三十日十三时二十分左右，美方军用喷气式飞机八架编队由南方侵入我方椒岛、汉川附近及丰川洞等地上空，然后向南飞去。同日十三时三十九分左右，美方军用喷气式飞机八架编队由南方侵入我方清川江口之立石里等地上空盘旋约三分钟，然后向南经我方长渊、梦金浦里等地上空向西飞去。
