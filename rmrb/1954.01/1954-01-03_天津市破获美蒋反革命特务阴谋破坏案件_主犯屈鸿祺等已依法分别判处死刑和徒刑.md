The Tianjin Public Security Bureau, after thorough investigation, cracked a counter-revolutionary case in mid-November of last year involving lurking American-Chiang Kai-shek spies plotting sabotage and assassination. The principal and accessory criminals Qu Hongqi, Pan Guocheng, Liu Mingyang, and Jiang Jinfang have all been arrested and have confessed to all their crimes during interrogation. The Tianjin Military Control Commission has, in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolution," sentenced the criminals to death, death with a reprieve, and fixed-term imprisonment respectively.

The principal culprit Qu Hongqi and others were dispatched by the "Sino-American Joint Office," jointly formed by the American intelligence agencies and the Kuomintang secret service "National Defense Ministry Confidential Bureau," to infiltrate the Tianjin area to carry out sabotage and assassination activities. They were directly commanded by Cui Duo, an action agent of the former Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Confidential Bureau" in Hong Kong, who was directly responsible to the "Sino-American Joint Office" located in Taipei, Taiwan Province, and supervised by American intelligence officials stationed in Hong Kong. The task given to Qu Hongqi and other criminals by the "Sino-American Joint Office" was to carry out bombings and arson against buildings, important factories, warehouses, and bustling public places under construction in our country in the Tianjin area, and to look for opportunities to assassinate senior leaders of the People's Government.

According to Qu Hongqi's confession, his special agent code name was "Zhao Longxing," and his alias in Taiwan and Hong Kong was "Wu Junyi." Before liberation, he worked at the Meifu Petroleum Company gas station in Tianjin. In May 1949, he joined the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters Technical Corps" in Shanghai, serving as a warrant officer. Soon after, he fled to Taiwan with the team. During his time in Taiwan, the team was reorganized into the "Taiwan Provincial Garrison Headquarters Technical Corps." Qu received training in blasting and the preparation of explosives at this time. In July 1950, Qu was selected to work in the "Second Division of the National Defense Ministry Confidential Bureau" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits as an action agent, under the command of Cui Duo, a major action agent of the division. At that time, the American and Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies planned to send him to Tianjin to carry out sabotage and assassination activities. In March 1952, an American agent from the "Sino-American Joint Office" summoned Cui Duo and Qu Hongqi. Zhang Longwen, the director of the Second Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Confidential Bureau, and four others also attended the conversation, with Zhou Guanchang acting as interpreter. This American agent tested their knowledge of explosives and inquired about their history. He was particularly interested in Qu Hongqi's former position at the Meifu Petroleum Company gas station in Tianjin, believing it to be an advantage for Qu to carry out sabotage activities in Tianjin. In April and September of the same year, this American agent summoned them twice more, detailed the tasks, stipulated the methods of contact in Hong Kong after their arrival, issued them US$1,100 in working expenses, and determined that they would be given US$150 per month for living expenses thereafter. Before leaving Taiwan, Cui Duo and Qu Hongqi received from the "Sino-American Joint Office" 60 pounds of American-made gelatin dynamite for special agent use, 50 detonating cords, 100 detonators, 50 electric detonators, 4 pistols, 200 rounds of ammunition, two bottles of potassium cyanide, and a set of secret writing chemicals, all of which were secretly transported to Hong Kong by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Confidential Bureau."

In October 1952, Cui Duo and Qu Hongqi arrived in Hong Kong and began their activities. In November of the same year, they recruited Liu Mingyang, an unemployed Hong Kong sailor, and Qu Hongqi taught him how to prepare explosives, how to bomb, and how to set fires. In December of the same year, Cui Duo appointed Liu Mingyang as the "Leader of Group 107," gave him HK$500 for activities, and ordered him to infiltrate Tanggu to investigate and sabotage military bases, warehouses, and docks. In the first half of 1953, Cui Duo met with an American agent stationed in Hong Kong from the "Sino-American Joint Office" three times, twice at a hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, on dates determined by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Confidential Bureau," and once the American agent went directly to Cui Duo and Qu Hongqi's residence in Hong Kong. In these three meetings, the American agent checked the implementation of Cui Duo's work plan, allocated them US$2,000 for activities, and told them to step up their activities. Shortly thereafter, Qu Hongqi obtained a permit to come to Tianjin and infiltrated Tianjin on July 29th of last year. After infiltrating Tianjin and Tanggu, Qu Hongqi and Liu Mingyang maintained regular contact with Cui Duo using pre-arranged secret codes for communication. According to Cui Duo's instructions, in addition to preparing to receive explosive materials transported from Hong Kong, Qu Hongqi actively investigated and searched for sabotage targets. Qu Hongqi also contacted Li Weixiangyun, an old acquaintance of Cui Duo, and took away the secret writing chemicals sent by Cui Duo. Li Weixiangyun promised to help Qu "store goods" and had financially supported Qu's criminal activities. From September 20th to November 14th of last year, a Hubei轮 ship traveled between Hong Kong and Tianjin three times. The crew members Pan Guocheng and Jiang Jinfang had long been bought by Cui Duo to serve as secret "transportation" for Qu Hongqi to transport explosive materials and poisons. On the three occasions when the Hubei ship came to Tianjin, Pan Guocheng carried out Cui Duo's orders, transporting a total of three detonating cords, three detonators, a bottle of poison (potassium cyanide), and five packages of secret writing chemicals. Each time, Pan Guocheng secretly transported the materials to land at once, and then Jiang Jinfang and his wife Chen Caidi contacted each other to arrange the time and place for the "delivery," and then Chen Caidi received them at the appointed place and hid them. These criminal activities of Pan, Jiang, and other criminals were already known to our People's Public Security organs. After obtaining conclusive evidence of their conspiratorial activities, they were cracked down on in one fell swoop. The detonating cords and other items used to carry out sabotage activities were also seized on the spot. According to Qu Hongqi's confession, he had already selected targets and prepared an action plan to purchase chemical drugs such as potassium chlorate locally, prepare them into explosives, and install them together with the delivered detonating cords and detonators to make three time bombs (two 21-minute ones and one one-and-a-half-hour one), and use time bombs to carry out arson and sabotage against a key construction site of the Tianjin Construction Company of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau, a key oil storage depot of the North China District Company of the China Petroleum Company, and the Tianjin Municipal Joint Public-Private Venture Xinzhongyuan Company, and to take the opportunity to poison the leaders of the People's Government with potassium cyanide.

This case was later transferred by the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau to the Military Law Department of the Tianjin Municipal Military Control Commission for trial. After strict interrogation, the Military Law Department of the Tianjin Municipal Military Control Commission, in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolution," sentenced Qu Hongqi and Pan Guocheng to death, Liu Mingyang to death with a reprieve, Jiang Jinfang and Li Weixiangyun to 15 years of fixed-term imprisonment, and Chen Caidi to five years of fixed-term imprisonment.

    天津市破获美蒋反革命特务阴谋破坏案件
    主犯屈鸿祺等已依法分别判处死刑和徒刑
    天津市人民政府公安局经过周密的侦查，在去年十一月中旬破获了一件潜伏的美蒋特务阴谋进行破坏和暗害活动的反革命案件，主从各犯屈鸿祺、潘国诚、刘明扬和蒋金发等已全部落网，并在审讯中对他们所犯的罪行全部供认。天津市军事管制委员会已根据“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”分别判处各犯以死刑、死刑缓刑和有期徒刑。
    主犯屈鸿祺等是受美国情报机关和国民党特务机关“国防部保密局”联合组成的“中美联合办公处”的派遣，潜来天津地区进行破坏和暗害活动的。他们直接受现在香港的前蒋匪帮“保密局”行动特务崔铎的指挥，崔铎直接对设于台湾省台北市的“中美联合办公处”负责，并受该处驻香港的美国特务官员的督导。“中美联合办公处”交给屈鸿祺等犯的任务，是要他们在天津地区对我们国家兴修的建筑物、重要工厂、仓库和繁华的公共场所实行爆破和纵火，并寻找时机暗害人民政府的高级首长。
    据屈犯鸿祺供称，他的特务代名是“赵隆兴”，在台湾和香港时的化名是“吴君逸”。解放前曾在天津市美孚石油公司加油站任职，一九四九年五月在上海参加了蒋匪帮“京沪杭警备司令部技术总队”，充任准尉队员。不久便同该队一起潜逃到台湾。在台湾期间，该队改编为“台湾省警备司令部技术总队”。屈犯曾在此时受过爆破和配制炸药等多方面的训练。一九五○年七月，屈犯被选调到蒋匪帮“国防部保密局第二处”任行动员，由该处少校行动员崔铎指挥。当时美蒋特务机关就计划派他到天津进行破坏和暗害活动。一九五二年三月间，“中美联合办公处”的某美国特务召见了崔铎和屈鸿祺。参加这次谈话的还有蒋匪帮保密局第二处处长张龙文等四人。由周贯昌任翻译。这个美国特务测验了他们的爆破知识，询问了他们的历史，对屈鸿祺曾在天津市美孚石油公司加油站任职一事特别感到兴趣，认为这是利用屈犯在天津进行破坏活动的有利条件。同年四月和九月，这个美国特务又两次召见他们，详细布置了任务，规定了他们到香港后的接头联络办法，发给工作费一千一百元美金，并确定以后每月发给他们生活费一百五十元美金。在离台之前，崔铎和屈鸿祺等由“中美联合办公处”领到美制的供特工专用的胶性爆炸药六十磅、延性信管五十个、雷管一百个、电雷管五十个、手枪四枝、子弹二百发、氰化钾两瓶及密写药剂一部，均交由蒋匪帮“保密局”代为秘密运到香港。
    一九五二年十月，崔铎和屈鸿祺到达香港活动。并于同年十一月招募了香港失业海员刘明扬，由屈鸿祺教给他配制炸药和爆破纵火的方法。同年十二月，崔铎指派刘犯明扬充任“一○七小组组长”，发给他活动费港币五百元，要他到塘沽潜伏活动，任务是调查和破坏军事基地和仓库码头。一九五三年上半年，崔铎曾三次与“中美联合办公处”住港的美国特务接头，两次由蒋匪“保密局”决定日期，在九龙尖沙嘴某酒店晤面，一次是美国特务直接到崔铎、屈鸿祺在港的住所。在这三次接头中，美国特务检查了崔铎的工作计划执行的情况，拨给他们活动费两千美金，要他们加紧活动。此后不久，屈鸿祺骗到了来天津的通行证，在去年七月二十九日潜抵天津。屈鸿祺和刘明扬在潜抵天津和塘沽后，用事先规定好的密语通信和崔铎保持了经常的联系。屈鸿祺根据崔铎的指示，除准备接收从香港运来的爆破器材外，便积极调查与物色破坏目标。屈犯鸿祺还曾和崔匪铎的旧相识李魏湘筠联系过，从她那里取走了崔铎派人送来的密写药剂；李魏湘筠答应可以替屈犯“存放货物”，并曾在经济上资助过屈犯的罪恶活动。去年九月二十日到十一月十四日，曾有一艘湖北轮三次往返于香港和天津之间。该轮的船员潘国诚和蒋金发，早为崔匪铎所收买，担任屈犯鸿祺运送爆破器材和毒药的秘密“交通”。在湖北轮三次来津时，潘犯国诚均执行了崔铎的命令，计先后运来延性信管三只、雷管三只、毒药（氰化钾）一瓶、密写药五包等物。每次均由潘犯国诚一次把器材密运到陆地上，再由蒋犯金发和其妻陈彩娣联系，规定交“货”的时间和地点，然后由陈犯彩娣按时在预定地点接收，并代为窝藏。潘、蒋等犯的这些罪恶活动早为我人民公安机关所侦悉。当获得其阴谋活动的确证后，即一举破获。阴谋进行破坏活动的罪证延性信管等物，也都被当场搜获。据屈犯鸿祺供称，他已选好了目标，作好了行动计划，要在当地购买氯酸钾等化学药品，自行配制成炸药，与运来的延性信管和雷管装置在一起，做成三个定时炸弹（两个二十一分钟的，一个一小时半的），对我天津市人民政府建筑工程局天津建筑公司某重要工地、中国石油公司华北区公司某重要储油库和天津市公私合营的新中原公司等，用定时炸弹实行纵火破坏，并相机用氰化钾对人民政府的首长实行毒害。
    此案后由天津市人民政府公安局移送天津市军事管制委员会军法处审理。天津市军事管制委员会军法处经过严密审讯，即根据“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”，分别判处屈犯鸿祺和潘犯国诚死刑，刘犯明扬死刑缓刑，蒋犯金发和李魏湘筠有期徒刑十五年，陈彩娣有期徒刑五年。
