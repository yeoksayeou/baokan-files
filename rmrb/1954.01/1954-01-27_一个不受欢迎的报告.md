　　An Unpopular Report
　　Tong Fen
　　One day, the Fuxin Mining Bureau held a staff meeting. The labor union chairman came with his speech to give a report, entitled: Summary of the Promotion of Advanced Experiences. In the beginning, everyone listened attentively. As they listened, some people started to discuss it. At this time, a comrade responsible for promoting advanced experience hurriedly handed a note to the labor union chairman: "It's not that a certain mine and a certain section proposed a promotion plan that wasn't deployed to the pithead; it's that the mine manager proposed the promotion plan in the bureau, but only conveyed it to the business section when he went back, and didn't deploy it to the pithead." So the labor union chairman hurriedly brought his mouth close to the loudspeaker to correct himself: "I misspoke just now... it should be that a certain mine manager proposed the plan for promoting advanced experience in the bureau, but didn't convey it to the business section when he went back, nor did he deploy it to the pithead." People were even more confused after hearing this. It turned out that he had misread "only conveyed it to the business section" as "didn't convey it to the business section."
　　The labor union chairman continued to speak. Some other people became impatient and wrote a note to the labor union chairman, which said: "A week ago, you gave a report saying that our mine was doing very well, why do you say it's not good today? Isn't this a contradiction!" The labor union chairman was stunned when he saw it. But after a moment of hesitation, he said: "Everything has two sides, good and bad. I was talking about the good side before, and now I'm talking about the bad side."
　　Then he continued reading the speech: "...In the future, in transportation, we must promote Niu Shulin's safe operation experience." Someone sitting by the window chuckled. It turned out that this advanced experience belonged to the mechanical and electrical aspects, and the labor union chairman put Zhang San's hat on Li Si's head. Maybe there were too many places that needed to be corrected? No more notes were seen being passed up.
　　The staff were very dissatisfied with this report. What about the labor union chairman? He was also dissatisfied with the secretaries who organized the materials and drafted the speech. But the important thing is that the labor union chairman should be dissatisfied with his own work: why didn't he go deep to understand the situation at ordinary times, and make a fool of himself when giving a report? This example may be prominent, but it is by no means an isolated case. Some people who have the same problem as this labor union chairman should learn a lesson from this.

### 一个不受欢迎的报告

　　一个不受欢迎的报告
    彤芬
    有一天，阜新矿务局召开了一个职工大会。工会主席挟着讲演稿来作报告，题目是：推广先进经验的总结。开始，大家都凝神静听。听着听着，有一部分人议论起来了。这时，一位负责推广先进经验的同志，赶急给工会主席递了一个纸条：“不是某矿某科提出推广计划不向坑口布置；而是矿长在局里提出推广计划，回去只向业务科传达，不向坑口布置。”于是工会主席慌忙把嘴凑近扩音器来更正：“刚才我说错了。……应该是某矿长在局里提出推广先进经验计划，回去不向业务科传达，也不向坑口布置。”人们听了，更加莫名其妙。原来他把“只向业务科传达”又错念成“不向业务科传达”了。
      工会主席又继续往下讲。另一部人有些耐不住了，又写条子给工会主席递去，纸条上说：“一个星期以前你作了一个报告，说我们矿做得很好，今天为什么又说不好？岂不是前后矛盾！”工会主席一看就怔住了。但他略一踌躇便说：“任何一件事情都有好、坏两面。以前我说的是好的一面，现在我说的是坏的一面。”
    接着又往下念讲演稿：“……今后运输方面要推广牛书麟的安全运转经验。”靠窗户的座位上有人噗哧一声笑了起来。原来这个先进经验是属于机电方面的，工会主席把张三的帽子给李四戴上了。可能是需要更正的地方太多的缘故吧？没见再有纸条子递上去。
    职工们听了这个报告很不满意。工会主席呢？对几个整理材料起草讲演稿的秘书也不满意。但重要的是工会主席应该对自己的工作不满意：为什么平时不深入了解情况，等到作报告时闹笑话呢？这事例也许是突出的，但决不是个别的。一些和这位工会主席具有同病的人，应当从这里接受一点教训。
