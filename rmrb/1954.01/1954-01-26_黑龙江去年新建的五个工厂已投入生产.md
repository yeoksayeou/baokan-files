Heilongjiang Province's local state-owned industry achieved new development last year. The province built six new factories last year, including the Hongguang Sugar Factory, the First Paper Mill, the Second Machinery Factory, the Golden Pen Factory, the Soap Factory, and the Milk Powder Factory. Except for the First Paper Mill, the other five factories have been put into production one after another. When all six factories are put into production, the total output value of the local state-owned industry under the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry will increase by 47.39% compared with last year. This will not only accumulate a large amount of construction funds for the state, but also steadily increase the socialist economic component of the province.

Among the newly built factories, there is the Heilongjiang Second Machinery Factory, which serves basic construction. The factory has dozens of machine tools and Soviet-style cupola furnaces. It began accepting processing orders from basic construction departments in July last year, producing various plumbing materials. In addition, the original Heilongjiang First Machinery Factory was expanded. This year, the factory will produce 300 vacuum pumps to meet the needs of basic construction and industrial and mining production.

Among the newly built factories, there are also the Hongguang Sugar Factory, the Heilongjiang Soap Factory, and the Anda Milk Powder Factory, which serve the people's livelihood. The Hongguang Sugar Factory is one of the largest newly built machine-made sugar factories in China. This sugar factory is designed based on advanced Soviet experience and equipped with domestically made machines, and the production equipment is relatively advanced. The factory officially started production on January 8th, processing 800 tons of sugar beets per day and producing 25,000 tons of sugar annually. This year, it can turn over more than 16.6 billion yuan in industrial profits. The Heilongjiang Soap Factory started production in July last year, producing 1,000 tons of soap annually, and is preparing to produce scented soap. Since the Anda Milk Powder Factory started operations in December last year, it has processed more than 8,000 kilograms of milk per day, and can produce nearly 600,000 pounds of nutritious whole milk powder throughout the year. The start of production of these three factories will greatly promote the development of agricultural cash crops, local products, and animal husbandry, and increase farmers' incomes.

Among the newly built factories, there are also the Heilongjiang First Paper Mill and the Heilongjiang Golden Pen Factory, which serve the people's cultural life. The Heilongjiang First Paper Mill is large in scale, with a factory building area of more than 16,000 square meters. The equipment is also relatively modern, and the factory has power, papermaking, pulping, and machine repair workshops. It is currently undergoing comprehensive trial runs and will be officially put into production at the end of January. After the factory is put into production, it can produce 18 tons of newsprint per day. The Heilong brand golden pens produced by the Heilongjiang Golden Pen Factory have always been popular with buyers in the market. This year, it can produce 100,000 large and small golden pens.

    黑龙江去年新建的五个工厂已投入生产
    黑龙江省地方国营工业，在去年一年中获得了新的发展。该省去年新建了红光糖厂、第一纸厂、第二机械厂、金笔厂、肥皂厂、乳粉厂等六个工厂，除第一纸厂以外，其他五个工厂已先后投入生产。这六个工厂全部投入生产后，将使黑龙江省工业厅所属地方国营工业的生产总值比去年上升百分之四十七点三九，不但可为国家积累大批建设资金，也使该省社会主义经济成分稳步增长。
    在新建的工厂中，有为基本建设服务的黑龙江第二机械厂，该厂共有数十台工作母机和苏式立炉、冲天炉，从去年七月就开始接受基本建设部门的加工订货，生产各种水暖器材。另外，并扩建了原有的黑龙江第一机械厂，该厂今年将生产三百台真空泵，供应基本建设和工矿生产需要。
    在新建的工厂中，还有为人民生活服务的红光糖厂、黑龙江肥皂厂和安达乳粉厂。红光糖厂是我国新建的最大机器制糖厂之一。这座糖厂是根据苏联先进经验设计、用本国制造的机器装备起来的，生产设备比较先进。该厂于一月八日已正式生产，每日可处理甜菜八百吨，每年可产砂糖两万五千吨。今年可上缴工业利润一百六十六亿多元。黑龙江肥皂厂从去年七月开工生产，每年可产肥皂一千吨，并准备生产香皂。安达乳粉厂从去年十二月开工以后，每天加工八千多公斤牛奶，全年能产滋养丰富的全脂乳粉近六十万磅。这三个工厂的开工生产，将大大促进农业经济作物、土产品及畜牧业的发展，增加农民的收入。
    在新建的工厂中，还有为人民文化生活服务的黑龙江第一纸厂和黑龙江金笔厂。黑龙江第一纸厂规模很大，厂房建筑面积有一万六千多平方公尺；设备也比较近代化，全厂有动力、抄纸、打浆、机修等车间，现正进行全面试车，一月末即可正式生产。该厂投入生产后，每天可生产新闻纸十八吨。黑龙江金笔厂出产的黑龙牌金笔，在市场上一直受着买主的欢迎。今年可产大、小型金笔十万支。
