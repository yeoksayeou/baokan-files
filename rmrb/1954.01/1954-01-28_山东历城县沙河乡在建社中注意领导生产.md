Shahe Township, District One, Licheng County, Shandong Province, after conducting thorough and extensive publicity regarding the general line and tasks of the state during the transition period, the farmers' enthusiasm for establishing agricultural production cooperatives has greatly increased. The township has now newly established nine cooperatives, and the original cooperative has also been greatly expanded. The newly established cooperatives have all elected preparatory committees for running the cooperatives and are studying specific issues such as land shares. However, in the work of expanding and piloting agricultural production cooperatives, due to the lack of foresight of leading cadres, current production has been affected. After this was discovered, it has now been corrected.

Initially, in the newly established and expanded agricultural production cooperatives, there were two common problems that had not been resolved: First, the masses joining the cooperatives did not have a sufficient understanding of doing a good job in winter production to lay a solid foundation for increased production, believing that after joining the cooperative, all work should be delayed until the cooperative has arranged it before it is done; second, because the cooperative had not promptly worked out a method of recording work points for doing work in the initial stage of joining the cooperative, households with labor and livestock were afraid of working without getting work points from the cooperative; households without labor were afraid of seeking grain from outside. As a result, everyone was not actively engaged in production. For example, in the cooperative established on the basis of the Zhao Jiaxiang team, because this problem was not resolved, households with livestock and labor did not work, and households without labor proposed that their land did not need winter plowing.

After discovering these problems, the county party committee work team stationed in the township and the Shahe Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party further publicized to the backbone of the cooperatives and the farmers joining the cooperatives the significance of doing a good job in current production for increasing production in the future and for consolidating the cooperatives. On this ideological basis, they arranged current production according to the specific conditions of each cooperative and studied the method of recording points. Each cooperative compiled temporary production teams to carry out division of labor. Before a unified scoring method was worked out, work was recorded uniformly first, and points would be scored uniformly after the scoring method was available. After educating the members of the cooperatives, current production was greatly promoted. For example, the Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative, according to the situation of agricultural and sideline production, divided the labor and animal power in the cooperative into five agricultural production teams and two sideline production teams, and mobilized the members of the cooperative to voluntarily invest 14.5 million yuan in sideline production and 4,500 jin of rice straw, so that 22 straw bag machines were put into operation in time, and all 250 mu of spring land suitable for winter plowing were plowed according to plan, and soil improvement work was carried out in 9.6 mu of land, digging 800 large carts of soil. In the cooperative established on the basis of the Zhao Jiaxiang team, the members of the cooperative all reported the land that they should plow in winter and the number of carts of soil they should pull. Households with labor and livestock were no longer afraid of contributing livestock and labor. Everyone put forward the slogan of "meeting in the evening to run the cooperative, and engaging in production during the day," and production was very active.

　　山东历城县沙河乡在建社中注意领导生产
    山东历城县一区沙河乡，经过深入广泛地宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务后，农民对于成立农业生产合作社的积极性大为提高。全乡现在已经新成立九个社，原有的一个社也已大大扩大。新成立的社都选出了办社筹备委员会，正在研究土地入股等具体问题。但是在扩大和试办农业生产合作社工作中，因为领导干部缺乏预见性，使当前生产受到了影响，经发觉后，现在已经得到纠正。
    最初，在新办和扩大的农业生产合作社里，较普遍地存在两个问题没有得到解决：一是入社群众对作好冬季生产，为增产打好基础认识不足，认为入社了，什么活都要拖到社里安排好后再干；一是由于社里未及时研究出在入社初期干活的记工办法，因之，有劳力有牲畜的户怕干了活，社内不给记工；无劳力户则怕向外找粮食，大家都不积极进行生产。如以赵加祥组为基础成立的社，因这一问题未得到解决，有牲口有劳力的户就都不出工，无劳力户则提出自己的地不需要冬耕。
    驻该乡的县委工作组和中共沙河乡支部委员会发现了这些问题后，进一步对办社骨干和入社农民宣传了搞好当前生产对今后增产的意义和对巩固合作社的作用。在这个思想基础上又根据每个社的具体情况安排了当前生产，研究了记分办法。各个社都编好临时生产队进行了分工，还没有订出统一的评分办法以前就先统一记工，等有了评分办法后再统一评分。经过对社员进行教育后，大大推动了当前生产。如王朝佑农业生产合作社，根据农副业生产情况，把社内劳力畜力划分了五个农业生产队和两个副业生产队，并发动社员自愿向社内副业投资一千四百五十万元，稻草四千五百斤，使二十二架草包机及时开了工，把适于冬耕的二百五十亩春地全部按计划耕完，并在九亩六分地里进行了改良土壤的工作，挖土八百大车。以赵加祥组为基础成立的社，社员都报出自己应冬耕的土地和拉土的车数，有劳力有牲口户也不怕出牲口和出人力了，大家提出，“晚上开会办社，白天进行生产”的口号，生产非常积极。
