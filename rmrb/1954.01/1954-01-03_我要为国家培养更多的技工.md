    I Want to Train More Technicians for the Country
    National Railway Labor Model　Peng Xingde
    The second year of the first Five-Year Plan has arrived, the Party requires us to do more work, and the people are focusing their attention on the working class. Can we meet the Party's requirements and the people's hopes? Recalling the progress of work over the past year, I dare say: we will definitely make greater achievements this year!
    I was originally a welder, and after liberation, I was promoted to foreman. Last July, the higher authorities assigned me to be the deputy director of the steel rail welding and repair team of the Beijing Railway Administration's Public Works Department. This scared me. Originally, there were more than sixty technicians, more than two hundred and ten temporary workers, and in addition, engineers, foremen, and technicians were often on the sidelines to guide. Now the task has not been reduced, but there are only seventeen technicians and one hundred and twenty temporary workers left. What can I do? Later, I thought, steel can be made into machines, so why can't these farmers from the countryside be transformed into skilled workers in a short period of time? So I was determined to train them.
    In this situation, we must first give play to the role of the dozen or so technicians. But I found that some technicians were working according to the old methods, which were slow and laborious. I taught them to use new methods, but they insisted that their methods were good. While explaining, I demonstrated it to them, and slowly some people were already working according to the new method. I encouraged them in a timely manner, and in this way, the advanced working method was slowly promoted. Later, I also found that some technicians had a "keep a trick up their sleeve" mentality when teaching temporary workers, fearing that if they taught others, they would not be able to make a living. So I told them about the difference between the new society and the old society and the country's future prospects. Once their thinking was straightened out, their enthusiasm came, and they took the initiative to propose that all the temporary workers should be trained to become technicians. In the process of training, some problems also occurred on the side of the temporary workers, such as some temporary workers only cared about watching the trains while working, forgetting the work in their hands, resulting in injuries to their legs and feet, or not wearing rubber gloves when grinding tools with an electric grinding wheel, resulting in electric shock, and so on. These have also been changed after explaining technical safety and labor protection. Half a year of effort has enabled more than one hundred temporary workers to become more skilled technicians. As a result, production efficiency has increased significantly, and the entire team completed the task for the second half of last year forty-five days ahead of schedule; it was originally planned to increase production by 260 million yuan for the country, but the actual amount exceeded the target by 330 million yuan.
    Training temporary workers into skilled workers not only ensured the completion of last year's production tasks, but also this group of workers will create greater wealth for the country this year. This year, another group of new temporary workers will come to work here, and I will definitely use my best efforts to train them so that they can quickly become skilled workers to meet the needs of national construction.

    我要为国家培养更多的技工
    全国铁路劳动模范　彭兴德
    第一个五年计划的第二年来到了，党要求我们做好更多的工作，人民群众把目光集中在工人阶级身上。我们能不能满足党的要求和人民的希望呢？回忆一年来的工作进展，我敢说：我们一定能在今年作出更大的成绩！
    我本来是个熔接工，解放后被提升为工长。去年七月，上级分配我担任北京铁路管理局公务处钢轨焊接修配组的副主任，这一下，可把我吓住了。原先这里有六十多个技工，二百一十多个临时工，此外，还有工程师、领工员、技术员经常在旁边指导。现在任务没减，而人却只剩十七个技工、一百二十个临时工，这可叫我怎么办呢？后来我想，钢铁都能制造成机器，这些从农村来的农民为什么不能在短期内变成掌握技术的工人呢？于是下决心培养他们。
    在这种情况下，必须首先发挥十几个技工的作用。可是我发现有些技工按老方法工作，又慢又费劲。我教他们用新法子，他们硬说他们的法子好。我一面说，一面表演给他们看，慢慢地有一些人已按新法作了，我就及时鼓励他们，这样先进工作法就慢慢地推广起来了。随后，我又发现有些技工在教临时工的时候，还有“留一手思想”，怕教会了别人，自己就吃不开了。于是我就把新社会和旧社会的不同以及国家的远景讲给他们听，思想通了，干劲就来了，他们主动地提出，要把所有的临时工都培养成技工。在培养过程中，临时工方面也曾发生了一些问题，比如有些临时工干活的时候，只顾看火车，忘了手里的活，以致打伤自己腿脚，或用电磨轮磨工具的时候，不戴橡皮手套，触了电等等。这些，经过讲解技术安全和劳动保护后也都改变了。半年的努力，使得一百多个临时工，都成了较熟练的技工。因此，生产效率显著提高，全组去年下半年任务提前四十五天完成了；原打算给国家增产二亿六千万元，实际超额完成了三亿三千万元。
    把临时工培养成技术工人，不仅保证了去年生产任务的完成，而且，这批工人在今年还会给国家创造更大的财富。今年又要有一批新的临时工要来我们这儿工作了，我一定要用最大的努力，培养他们，使他们迅速成为熟练工人，以适应国家建设的需要。
