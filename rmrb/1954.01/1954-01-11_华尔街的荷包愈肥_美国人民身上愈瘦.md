Wall Street's Pockets Grow Fat, While the American People Grow Leaner

Capitalists Make a Fortune

The profits of American monopoly capital greatly increased again in 1953. American economist Victor Perlo pointed out in an article published in the Soviet "Pravda" on January 4 that the average profit of American monopoly capital in 1953 was $42.3 billion. According to "World Trade Union Movement" magazine, issue No. 20, 1953, the profits of American monopoly capital are increasing year by year: $6.5 billion in 1939, $27.1 billion in 1949, and $40.8 billion in 1952. The magazine says: The annual profit of American monopoly capitalists is about equal to the annual income of 600 million people in Southeast Asia.

Unemployment Continues to Increase

The number of unemployed people in the United States also increased significantly in 1953. According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor, the number of unemployed people in the United States increased by 300,000 in November of last year; by the end of last year, the number of unemployed people in the United States had increased by 700,000 compared to the summer of the same year. A recent issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine said that in eleven states, including Ohio and Wisconsin, the number of unemployed people has doubled compared to the previous year.

An Associated Press reporter reported that at a recent conference hosted by the "American Statistical Association," most of the 300 economists attending the meeting believed that the American economy was in "recession," and two-thirds of them believed that this phenomenon would continue in 1954. This is the reason for the increase in the number of unemployed people in the United States. Therefore, American economist Keyserling said at a meeting on unemployment issues hosted by the United Automobile Workers Union that there is a real danger that the number of unemployed people in the United States will reach 9.5 million in 1954.

Farmers Live a Hard Life

American economist Victor Perlo, in his recently published book "The Negro in Southern Agriculture," explains that a large number of middle and small farmers in the United States are becoming increasingly impoverished and bankrupt. The author writes: In the southern United States, capitalists basically control all the land, and poor farmers account for more than 80% of all farmers there, many of whom cannot even afford mules and horses. In six southern states, more than 145,000 black people and more than 250,000 white people are in this situation. The low level of production technology caused by the lack of agricultural tools has bankrupted tens of thousands of farmers, who have had to become tenant farmers. The reward for their year-round hard work is only one-third or one-quarter of the food they harvest. Some of this food is even sold to landlords at low prices, sometimes even at one-fourteenth of the market price. In addition, tenant farmers must also perform various unpaid labor for the landlords during the specified time each year.

People Owe a Lot of Debt

According to official U.S. statistics, on October 31, 1953, the total amount of debt owed by the American people on credit had increased to more than $28.1 billion, an increase of more than $4 billion compared to the same time a year ago. Most of the items purchased on credit are installment debts for daily necessities. From the materials published by the American Collectors Association in November of last year, it can be seen that the number of customers of American retailers—the broad masses of working people—who have had to return the purchased daily necessities to the company because they cannot afford to repay their debts is increasing. According to statistics from the American Collectors Association, in November of last year, the number of cases where goods were recovered by companies because customers could not pay for them increased by 76%. The association said: The main reasons for this situation are illness and unemployment.

Terrible Slums

According to the "Chicago Daily News," Slusser, the head of the U.S. government's residential building committee, admitted after a 30,000-mile trip across the United States that more than 20% of the houses in major cities in the United States are terrible slums. Slums house 33% of the population in these cities.

But in the United States, there are more terrible phenomena than slums. According to the New York "Daily Worker" on October 1 of last year, in Detroit, the city of the American automobile king, a black woman named Mrs. May Liang and her three children were "housed" in a broken truck abandoned beside Nevada Street. And the four-member family was finally driven out of the truck by the local police.

The lack of housing for the American people is alarming. According to American journalist Gunther Stein in his book "The World the Dollar Built," "Another 11 million to 12 million houses are needed to house its (America's) 40 million families."

### 华尔街的荷包愈肥  美国人民身上愈瘦

    华尔街的荷包愈肥  美国人民身上愈瘦
    资本家大发横财
    一九五三年美国垄断资本的利润又大大增加了。美国经济学家维克托·佩洛在一月四日苏联“真理报”上发表文章指出：美国垄断资本在一九五三年一年中的平均利润是四百二十三亿美元。据“世界工会运动”杂志一九五三年第二十期报道：美国垄断资本利润正在逐年增加：一九三九为六十五亿美元，一九四九年已增加到二百七十一亿美元，一九五二年又增加到四百零八亿美元。这个杂志说：美国垄断资本家一年的利润，约等于东南亚六亿人民一年的收入。
    失业者不断增加
    美国失业人数在一九五三年也显著地增加了。据美国政府劳工部的统计说：去年十一月份，美国失业人数增加了三十万；到去年年底，美国失业人数比同年夏季又增加了七十万。最近一期“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说：在俄亥俄和威斯康星等十一个州里，失业人数比前年增加了一倍。
    美联社记者报道：最近“美国统计协会”主办了一次讨论会，出席会议的三百位经济学家大多数都认为美国的经济正在“衰退”，其中有三分之二的人认为，这种现象在一九五四年还会继续下去。这正是美国失业人数增加的原因。因此，美国经济学家凯塞林在联合汽车工人工会主持的讨论失业问题的会议上说：在一九五四年内，美国失业人数有达到九百五十万人的实际危险。
    农民生活苦
    美国经济学家维克托·佩洛在他最近出版的“南方农业中的黑人”一书中，说明美国大批中、小农民日趋贫困和破产。作者写道：在美国南部，资本家基本上控制了所有的田地，贫农在那里占全体农民百分之八十以上，他们有许多人连骡子和马也买不起。在南部六个州中，有十四万五千多黑人和二十五万多白人都是这种情况。由于缺乏农具而造成的生产技术的低下，使成千成万的农民破了产，不得不去作佃农。他们终年辛苦所得的报酬，只是他们所收获的食粮的三分之一或四分之一。就是这点粮食，有的还要廉价卖给地主，地主出的价钱有时甚至仅为市价的十四分之一。另外，佃农们每年还要在规定的时间里，为地主做各种无偿的劳动。人民欠债多
    据美国官方材料统计，在一九五三年十月三十一日，美国人民赊账欠款的总数，已增加到二百八十一亿多美元，比一年前同时增加了四十多亿美元。在赊购的项目里，大多是生活用品分期付款的债务，从去年十一月份美国收账员协会公布的材料中可以看出，美国零售商的顾客——广大劳动人民们，由于偿还不起欠款，而不得不把买来的日用品退给公司的情况是越来越多了。据美国收账员协会统计，在去年十一月份，因为交不起货款而被公司这样收回了货的情形增加了百分之七十六。这个协会说：造成这种情况的主要原因是疾病和失业。
    可怕的贫民窟
    据“芝加哥每日新闻”报道：美国政府住宅建筑委员会的负责人斯拉塞，在美国各地作了一次三万里的旅行之后承认：在美国各大城市里，都有百分之二十以上的住宅是可怕的贫民窟。贫民窟中住着这些城市中百分之三十三的人口。
    可是在美国比贫民窟更可怕的现象还多着呢。据去年十月一日纽约“工人日报”报道：在美国汽车大王的城市底特律，有一位黑人妇女梅良太太和她的三个孩子，是“安家”在内华达街旁一辆被人抛弃的破卡车里的。而且这四口之家最后还被当地的警察从这个卡车里赶了出去。
    美国人民房屋缺乏的情况是惊人的。据美国记者根特·史坦因在他的“美元造成的世界”一书中估计：“还需要一千一百万幢到一千二百万幢房屋来给它（美国）的四千万个家庭住。”
