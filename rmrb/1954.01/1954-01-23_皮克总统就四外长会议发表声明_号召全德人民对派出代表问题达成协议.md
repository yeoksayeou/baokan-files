Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 22nd: TASS reports: According to the German News Agency, German Democratic Republic President Wilhelm Pieck issued the following statement regarding the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Berlin:

    The entire German people wholeheartedly welcome the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Although everyone may have different hopes for the conference, all Germans who love their people and homeland hope that the Four Powers Conference will bring us closer to our great national goals. This goal is: to conclude a peace treaty, restore German unity, fully restore Germany's sovereignty and independence, and make Germany a truly democratic and peaceful country. This desire unites the vast majority of the German people. This goal is in line with our national will.

    But there is another force that is obsessed with armament and new wars; therefore, they have always opposed the Four Powers Conference. The person who acts as the mouthpiece and representative of these West German militarists and imperialists is Mr. Adenauer, the head of the Bonn Federal Government. On June 11, 1953, he openly denied that the Four Powers Conference was a way to restore German unity, even saying it was a risky move. More than half a year has passed since then. He spares no cost, even at the cost of maintaining and perpetuating the division of Germany, and intends to establish a new German defense force as part of the so-called "European Army." Therefore, the Adenauer government, even ten days before the Four Powers Conference, violated the constitution and submitted a bill to the Federal Parliament to implement conscription. This is a dangerous game that may bring disaster to our people. Its goal is to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Germany and create new international tensions. If this tension is eliminated by a European war, it will inevitably turn our German homeland into ruins.

    Therefore, the vital interests of the German people require them to contribute to mutual understanding among the great powers and the easing of international tensions. The best way to achieve this goal is for Germans to understand each other. Our people should understand that if they are once again pushed onto the path that has already caused them two catastrophes in a generation, their survival and their future will be in jeopardy. The upcoming Four Powers Conference has the potential to open up another path for the entire Germany - a path to lasting peace. Therefore, we must expose all the conspiracies and tricks of the old militarist forces and recognize the common goal that unites all peace-loving Germans at present. We must not allow those foreign imperialists who regard the German people and German youth as cheap cannon fodder for their military adventures to use the discord within the German people to achieve their selfish goals. Therefore, out of a sense of national responsibility, on the eve of the Four Powers Conference, I once again call on all compatriots in the east and west of our homeland to reach an all-German agreement on the issue of sending true representatives of the vital interests of the German people.

    The first common demand of all Germans is: The German people should speak at the Four Powers Conference through the representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic who are invited to attend the meeting.

    The German people hope that the four powers sending foreign ministers to the Berlin Conference will understand that the German people's demands are legitimate. It has been almost nine years since the end of the war, and the German people have every right to express their views at a conference discussing German issues. The demand to send representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference should not be understood as implying that the two governments may have different, or even contradictory, demands and opinions. Therefore, for the benefit of all the German people, the representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic should try to reach a unified, all-German viewpoint.

    Peace-loving Germans have every reason to demand the implementation of the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, because the implementation of these principles can free our people from war-obsessed imperialism and militarism, and give a unified Germany a guarantee of lasting peace, while also ensuring that Germany and all its neighbors develop good-neighborly relations on the basis of trust. No more new arms races, but peaceful cooperation that benefits the people of all European countries.

    Other measures stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement, such as Germany paying reparations, restricting Germany's peacetime industry and foreign trade, and requiring Germany to repay foreign debts related to the war and occupation, have been canceled for the German Democratic Republic. If the Western countries also generously declare their abandonment of these rights, as the Soviet government did during the negotiations with the delegation of the German Democratic Republic government on August 22, 1953, then they can also be canceled for West Germany. This can also be expressed as a common wish of representatives from East and West Germany.

    Based on all these considerations, on the eve of the Four Powers Conference, I once again appeal to all peace-loving people, to political figures, parliamentarians, and politicians in the western part of our homeland who recognize their responsibilities: Let us unite all forces, break through all obstacles, and seek understanding between the representatives of the two parts of Germany who have peaceful and patriotic ideas. Let us create an atmosphere of understanding and peace in every corner of Germany. Oppose any division, support unity. Only in this way can we see the representatives of the eastern and western parts of our homeland seek mutual understanding at a round table meeting. Only in this way can mutual understanding be achieved among all the German people, and representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic can be sent to the Four Powers Conference to jointly and truly represent the vital rights of the German people. Only in this way can a unified, democratic, and independent Germany be established, free from national disasters and division, and move towards true freedom and lasting peace.

### 皮克总统就四外长会议发表声明  号召全德人民对派出代表问题达成协议

    皮克总统就四外长会议发表声明
    号召全德人民对派出代表问题达成协议
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社柏林二十二日讯：据德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克就快要举行的柏林四国外长会议发表声明如下：
    全体德国人民衷心欢迎就要召开的四国外长会议。虽然每个人都可以对会议有不同的希望，但是所有热爱自己的人民和祖国的德国人都希望四国会议能使我们和全国的伟大目标更加接近。这个目标就是：缔结和约，恢复德国统一，完全恢复德国的主权和独立，使德国成为一个真正民主与和平的国家。这种愿望把绝大多数德国人民团结在一起。这个目标是符合我国的民族意愿的。
    但是还存在着另外一种势力，他们醉心于武装，醉心于新的战争；因此他们一直反对四国会议。充当这些西德军国主义分子和帝国主义分子的喉舌和代表的人，就是波恩联邦政府的首脑阿登纳先生。一九五三年六月十一日，他公开否认四国会议是恢复德国统一的途径，甚至说这是冒险的举动。从那时起，半年多过去了。他不惜任何代价，甚至不惜维持德国的分裂并使之永久化，而打算建立起一支新的德国国防军，作为所谓“欧洲军”的组成部分。因此，阿登纳政府还在四国会议召开的十天以前，就破坏宪法，向联邦议院提出一项实行征兵的法案。这是危险的玩火，可能使我国人民遭致灾难。它所追逐的目的是阻挠和平地重新统一德国和造成新的国际紧张局势。这种紧张局势如果靠欧洲战争来消除，就必然会使我们德意志祖国沦为废墟。
    因此，德国人民的切身利益要求德国人民对于大国的相互谅解和国际紧张局势的缓和作出贡献。要达到这个目的，最好的办法就是德国人彼此互相谅解。我国人民应当明白，如果再一次让人把自己推上一代之中已经使他们两次遭受浩劫的道路，那么，他们的生存和他们的未来就岌岌可危了。快要召开的四国会议有可能为整个德国打开另外一条道路——通向持久和平的道路。因此，必须揭穿一切旧军国主义势力的阴谋，揭穿它们的一切诡计，认清目前使一切爱好和平的德国人团结起来的共同目标。不能让那些把德国人民和德国青年看作自己军事冒险的廉价炮灰的外国帝国主义者利用德国人民内部的不和，来达到他们自私的目的。因此，出于民族责任感，在四国会议前夕，我再次号召我们祖国东西两部的全体同胞对派出德国人民切身利益的真正代表的问题达成全德协议。
    全体德国人的第一个共同要求是：德国人民应该通过被邀出席会议的德意志民主共和国代表和联邦共和国代表在四国会议上发言。
    德国人民希望派遣外长出席柏林会议的四大国能了解德国人民的要求是正当的。战争结束已经快九年了，德国人民有充分权利在讨论德国问题的会议上发表意见。不应把德意志民主共和国和联邦共和国派代表出席四外长会议的要求理解为双方政府可以有不同的、甚至是矛盾的要求和意见。因此，为了全体德国人民的利益，德意志民主共和国和联邦共和国双方的代表应设法取得统一的、全德的观点。
    爱好和平的德国人有一切理由要求实现波茨坦协定的原则，因为，实现这些原则才能使我国人民摆脱醉心战争的帝国主义和军国主义，给统一的德国以持久和平的保障，同时可以保证德国及其一切邻国在信任的基础上发展睦邻关系。不要新的军备竞赛，而要有利于欧洲各国人民的和平合作。
    波茨坦协定所规定的其他一些措施，如要德国支付赔款、限制德国和平时期的工业和对外贸易、要德国偿付与战争及占领有关的外债等，对德意志民主共和国来说，已经取消了。如果西方国家也像苏联政府在一九五三年八月二十二日与德意志民主共和国政府代表团谈判时一样宽宏大量地声明放弃这些权利，那么，对西德来说，也就可以取消。这也可以作为东德与西德代表的共同愿望而表达出来。
    根据这一切考虑，在四国会议召开前夕，我再一次向所有爱好和平的人们，向我们祖国西部认识到自己的责任的政界人士、议员和政治家发出下面的呼吁：让我们联合一切力量，冲破一切障碍，在德国两个部分具有和平与爱国思想的代表之间求得谅解。让我们在德国每一个角落造成谅解与和平的气氛。反对任何分裂，拥护团结。只有这样，我们才能看到我们祖国东部和西部的代表在一个圆桌会议上，求得相互谅解。只有这样，才能达成全体德国人民的相互谅解，派遣德意志民主共和国和联邦共和国的代表到四国会议上共同真正地代表德国人民的切身权利。只有这样，才能建立一个统一、民主、独立的德国，摆脱民族灾难和分裂，走向真正的自由和持久和平。
