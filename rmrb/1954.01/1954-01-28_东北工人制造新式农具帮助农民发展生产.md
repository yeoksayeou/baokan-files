　　Northeast Workers Manufacture New-Style Farm Tools to Help Farmers Develop Production

With the development of industrial production, over the past four years, Northeast workers have manufactured a large number of new-style farm tools, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides for farmers, vigorously promoting the development of agricultural production and socialist transformation in the Northeast.

According to incomplete statistics, in the past four years, Northeast farm tool factories have successively supplied rural areas with more than 6,800 sets of new-style animal-drawn farm tools (each set including three walking plows, and one each of seeders, harvesters, threshers, rollers, disc harrows, or tine harrows), and hundreds of thousands of pieces of new-style farm tools and machinery such as combination shovels and cultivators, sprayers, dusters, waterwheels, and corn threshers. These new-style farm tools have helped farmers begin to break away from heavy manual labor and improve labor efficiency. In the past, farmers used sickles to harvest wheat, which was backbreaking work, and they could not harvest even half a hectare of land in a day. After adopting new-style farm tools, farmers sat on the machine and drove the horses, and the harvester cut a large area in the blink of an eye, just like a barber's "clippers." Each hectare of land saved about half the labor compared to using old-style farm tools. New-style farm tools plowed deeper and shoveled finer, creating conditions for increasing the yield per unit area. The various crops of the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang City, which used new-style farm tools, had a unit area yield that exceeded the yield of local farmers by more than one to two times. In 1953, thanks to the vigorous promotion of new-style farm tools and the launch of agricultural technology reform movements throughout Northeast China, the average wheat yield per hectare increased by about 1,000 jin compared to the past, and the unit yield of field crops also increased significantly. The promotion of new-style farm tools has more powerfully promoted the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, thereby promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture. In Gaokan Village in the suburbs of Shenyang City, there were only a few mutual aid teams in the past. In 1952, after the farmers of the village received new-style farm tools loaned by the state, they voluntarily formed agricultural production cooperatives. Now, four agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the whole village, and most of the farmers have been organized. In Jixian County, Songjiang Province, before 1951, there were only some occasional and scattered mutual aid teams. After the promotion of 75 sets of new-style farm tools, 49 agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the county, and the original mutual aid teams have also been further expanded and consolidated.

While supplying new-style farm tools, Northeast workers have also manufactured a large number of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which have been supplied to rural areas in a timely manner. According to incomplete statistics from 1950 to 1952 alone, 22,145,917 jin of important chemical fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, and superphosphate of lime were supplied to farmers. More than 2,200 tons of important pesticides such as copper sulfate, 666, copper sulfate, lead arsenate, and tobacco powder were also supplied. The supply of these fertilizers and pesticides has effectively enhanced soil fertility and reduced crop damage, playing a certain role in increasing yields.

In order to continuously create new material foundations for the worker-peasant alliance, after liberation, while concentrating its main efforts on restoring heavy industry, the Northeast region actively restored and established farm tool factories to help agricultural development. Originally, there were only two farm tool factories in the Northeast. Now, there are five large-scale and well-equipped agricultural machinery manufacturing factories in the region, including Shenyang, Lingshan, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, and Jiamusi. All factories manufacture new-style farm tools in large quantities.

　　东北工人制造新式农具帮助农民发展生产
    随着工业生产的发展，东北工人四年来为农民制造了大批新式农具、化学肥料和农药等生产资料，有力地促进了东北农业生产的发展和社会主义改造。
    据不完全统计，四年来，东北各农具厂先后供应农村新式马拉农具六千八百余套（每套包括步犁三台，播种机、收割机、脱谷机、镇压器、圆盘耙或钉齿耙各一台），综合号铲趟机、喷雾器、喷粉器、水车、玉米脱粒机等新式农具农械数十万件。这些新式农具帮助农民开始摆脱了笨重的体力劳动，提高了劳动效率。过去，农民用镰刀割麦，累得腰酸腿疼，一天还割不到半垧地。采用新式农具后，农民坐在机座上驱着马，收割机就像理发的“推子”一样，眨眼间割出一大片，每垧地比使用旧式农具约节省一半人工，新式农具耕得深，铲得细，给提高单位面积产量创造了条件。沈阳市郊高坎农业生产合作社使用新式农具的各项作物，单位面积产量都超出当地农民的产量一倍到两倍以上。一九五三年，全东北由于大力推行了新式农具，并开展了农业技术改革运动，每垧麦田平均比过去增产一千市斤左右，大田作物的单位产量也有很大增加。新式农具的推行，更有力地推动了农村互助合作运动的发展，因而也就促进了对农业的社会主义改造。沈阳市郊区高坎村，过去只有几个互助组。一九五二年该村农民收到国家贷给的新式农具以后，便主动地组成了农业生产合作社，现在全村已成立了四个农业生产合作社，大部农民都已组织起来。松江省集贤县，一九五一年以前只有一些时插时散的互助组，从推行了七十五套新式农具以后，全县已成立了四十九个农业生产合作社，原有互助组也更加扩大和巩固。
    与供应新式农具的同时，东北工人又制造了大批化学肥料和农药，及时地供应了农村。仅据一九五○年到一九五二年的不完全统计，即供应农民硫铵、氯化铵、过磷酸石灰等重要化学肥料两千二百一十四万五千九百一十七万斤。王铜、六六六、硫酸铜、砒酸铅、烟草粉等重要农药两千二百余吨。这些肥料和农药的供应，有效地增强了地力，减少了农作物的灾害，对提高产量起了一定的作用。
    为了给工农联盟不断地创造新的物质基础，解放后，东北区在集中主要力量恢复重工业的同时，便积极恢复和筹建农具工厂，以帮助农业的发展。原来，东北只有两个农具工厂。现在，全区已有沈阳、灵山、松江、黑龙江、佳木斯等五个规模宏大、设备完整的农业机械制造工厂。各厂都大量制造新式农具。
