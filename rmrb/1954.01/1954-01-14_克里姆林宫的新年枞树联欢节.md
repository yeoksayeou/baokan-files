    The Moscow Kremlin, standing tall amidst the silver winter scenery, has been receiving thousands of the Soviet state's young masters every day since the New Year. More than 30,000 middle and primary school students from Moscow and the Moscow Oblast have participated in the New Year Fir Tree Festival organized there by the trade unions and the Communist Youth League.

    In the center of the white marble St. George's Hall stands a fir tree, about thirty meters high, decorated with dazzling colors. Children sing and dance around the fir tree in this magnificent palace. In this place, which is usually used for important gatherings such as meetings of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, famous Soviet actors perform various wonderful programs for the children. The children themselves also participate in the performances. Girls aged six or seven perform Russian dances, and toddlers over a year old, just learning to walk, laugh and jump in the hall. Every child participating in the performance receives a prize, and every child participating in the Fir Tree Festival receives a bag filled with abundant New Year's treats. (Attached pictures)

    On New Year's Day, 1954, thousands of Moscow students were invited to the Kremlin to participate in the New Year Fir Tree Festival.

    In the Kremlin, Father Frost and the Snow Maiden are with the children.

    克里姆林宫的新年枞树联欢节
    在银色冬景中耸立着的莫斯科克里姆林宫，新年以来每天都接待着成千的苏维埃国家的幼年主人。莫斯科市和莫斯科州已有三万多个中、小学生参加了工会和青年团在那里举办的新年枞树联欢节。
    在白色大理石的格奥尔基耶夫斯基大厅的中央，竖立着约三十公尺高的装饰得五光十色的枞树。孩子们在这辉煌的宫殿中围着枞树唱歌跳舞。在这平常作为举行苏联最高苏维埃会议等重要集会的地方，苏联著名的演员为孩子们演出了各种精彩的节目。孩子们自己也参加了表演。有六、七岁的女孩表演俄罗斯舞蹈，有一岁多的、才蹒跚学步的小孩在大厅中嘻笑欢跃。每个参加表演的孩子都得到一份奖品，每个参加枞树联欢节的孩子都得到一袋装满丰盛食品的新年礼物。（附图片）
