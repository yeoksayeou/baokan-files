Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 5th: The preliminary survey tasks planned for 1953 for the central and southern sections of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway were completed twenty-three and twenty-four days ahead of schedule, respectively.

    The central and southern sections of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway are both located within Yunnan Province, traversing the turbulent Jinsha River valley and the sparsely populated high mountain areas of northeastern Yunnan. After the rough survey work of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway was completed in April 1953, the 17th and 18th Survey and Design Teams of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, which were responsible for the survey work of these two sections, began preliminary survey work in these dangerous mountains and rapid waters. They launched a red flag competition and overcame many difficulties such as inconvenient supplies and harsh climate, which continuously improved work efficiency. In just a few months, employees of the two teams submitted more than 600 rationalization proposals. One suggestion made by engineer Tian Qinghua of the 18th Survey and Design Team could save 8 billion yuan in construction costs for a certain 3-kilometer-long tunnel.

    The people along the line in Yunnan Province warmly welcomed and assisted the preliminary survey work. The section from Huize to Qiaojia was a rugged mountain road, and the machinery used for the survey line was very difficult to transport. However, local farmers braved the summer heat to help the survey team transport the machinery to the construction site. An old woman by the Jinsha River saw that the survey team members had no vegetables to eat and gave them the preserved meat that she had saved for more than half a year and was reluctant to eat.

    成昆铁路中段和南段去年的初测任务完成
   【新华社昆明五日电】成昆铁路中段和南段已分别提前二十三天和二十四天完成了一九五三年的预定初测任务。
    成昆铁路中段和南段都在云南省境内，要经过水流湍急的金沙江河谷和滇东北人烟稀少的高山地带。一九五三年四月成昆路草测工作完成后，担任这两段勘测任务的中央人民政府铁道部第十七、十八两个勘测设计总队，就在这险山急水之间开始了初测工作。他们发起红旗竞赛，战胜了供应不便和气候恶劣等许多困难，使工作效率不断提高。几个月中，两队职工提出了六百多件合理化建议。第十八勘测设计总队工程师田庆华提的一个建议，使某一长三公里的隧道可以节省建筑费八十亿元。
    云南省沿线人民热情欢迎和帮助初测工作。从会泽到巧家是一段崎岖的山路，测线用的机器运输起来非常困难，可是当地农民冒着暑热，帮助勘测队把机器运到了工地。金沙江边的一个老大妈看见勘测队员没有菜吃，把自己保存了半年多舍不得吃的腊肉送给队员们吃。
