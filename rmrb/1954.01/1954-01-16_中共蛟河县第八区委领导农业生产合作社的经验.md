    The Experience of the Eighth District Committee of the CCP Jiaohe County in Leading Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    The seven agricultural production cooperatives led by the Eighth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, are all doing very well. Although the natural conditions of these cooperatives were not good in 1953, with excessive rainfall and rampant weed growth, the crops still grew well, and the grain harvested was more than that of mutual aid teams. The success of these cooperatives is inseparable from the leadership of the Eighth District Committee.
    When the Eighth District Committee began to establish cooperatives in 1953, it first paid attention to correcting the guiding ideology. At that time, some cadres had a hasty and rash mentality because some cadres saw that the O’Qinglin Agricultural Production Cooperative, which was established on a trial basis in 1952, could produce more grain, with each labor day being able to distribute ninety-four catties of sorghum. Therefore, they advocated a major development. Some cadres also believed that it was not easy to run a cooperative and temporarily did not engage in cooperatives. In response to these ideological situations, the Eighth District Committee led everyone to study the "Decision on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" of the CCP Central Committee, clearly recognizing the principle of actively leading steady progress and only allowing success and not failure. It also specifically studied the experience of the O’Qinglin Cooperative. This allowed the cadres to initially understand that both hasty advancement and passive waiting were not in line with the Party's policy. At this time, the Eighth District Committee determined to try out six more agricultural production cooperatives based on the specific situation of the Eighth District. During the trial, the District Committee further corrected the cadres' hasty and rash mentality and other shortcomings, so that the trial work proceeded smoothly.
    In the trial, the Eighth District Committee adopted the leadership method of breaking through at one point and promoting the general. The Eighth District Committee took the O’Qinglin Cooperative as a work base point, and all work was first tried out in the O’Qinglin Cooperative, and then promoted after experience was gained. This base point was personally led by Guo Hua, the secretary of the District Committee. The Eighth District Committee’s method of promoting experience was: (1) Organizing visits. In 1953, the Eighth District Committee organized the directors of each cooperative and the leaders of the mutual aid teams to visit the O’Qinglin Cooperative six times to see the advanced cultivation and management methods such as implementing wide sowing, thinning seedlings, and the contract system. Full preparations were made before organizing the visits, so the visits did not take long, but the effect was very good. The visitors were all very satisfied and were willing to follow the experience of the O’Qinglin Cooperative. (2) Convening a meeting of cadres from various cooperatives to summarize and exchange experiences. At the beginning of the spring ploughing in 1953, some cooperatives only paid attention to sideline production and ignored agricultural production. The Eighth District Committee convened a meeting and invited O’Qinglin to introduce their experience of increasing income by focusing on agricultural management. (3) Organizing report meetings. The Eighth District Committee organized and planned to invite O’Qinglin to report on their work experience to various cooperatives, which greatly promoted the work of each cooperative. After O’Qinglin introduced the members' love of public property and concern for the work of the cooperative, the members of other cooperatives consciously examined their thoughts of not caring about the cooperative.
    The Eighth District Committee knew that to run a cooperative well, it was necessary to cultivate a group of backbone members within the cooperative. Therefore, in daily work, it paid more attention to cultivating cadres. When the District Committee found that some district cadres were monopolizing the work of the cooperative, it immediately pointed out that the responsibility of the district cadres was to help the cadres of the cooperative discover and solve the problems of the cooperative in a timely manner, as well as to inspect the work and summarize the experience. After the District Committee corrected the work style of the district cadres monopolizing the work, the work of these cooperatives made significant progress. The cadres of the cooperatives also said with satisfaction: "If there are problems that cannot be solved, the district will come to help solve them. If the cooperative is run well, our work ability will also be improved. It is really a win-win situation." At present, more than 50 cadres who are relatively familiar with the business of agricultural production cooperatives have been trained throughout the district. This has laid a good foundation for the future development and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives.
    How to train cadres? The Eighth District Committee adopted the following methods: (1) Combining current work with policy education. At the beginning of the establishment of the cooperative, the focus was on education on the establishment of the cooperative and the management policy. During the summer weeding, education on democratic management was carried out, and after the autumn harvest, education on income distribution was carried out. This quickly improved the cadres' awareness and policy level, and played a guiding role in the current work. (2) District cadres pay attention to helping cadres discover and solve various problems. Guo Hua, the secretary of the District Committee, often worked with the members of the cooperative to understand the members' thoughts and the problems in the cooperative. Once, Guo Hua worked with Yin Jiusheng's hoeing team and learned that some members had opinions on the current method of using livestock, and it had begun to affect their enthusiasm for production. That night, Guo Hua reported this problem to the leading cadres of the cooperative, and the leading cadres of the cooperative convened the Production Management Committee to discuss and improve the method of using livestock. (3) Pay attention to helping the cadres of the cooperative to check the work, summarize the experience, and formulate work plans. The Eighth District Committee once helped the O’Qinglin Cooperative to summarize the experience of using good and bad typical examples to carry out ideological education. This experience played a great role in consolidating the cooperative. (4) Convene a meeting of cooperative directors to exchange management experience. In the spring and summer of 1953, the District Committee convened two meetings, focusing on the exchange of experience in the contract system and democratic management, which greatly enlightened the cadres. (5) Adopt the method of individual talks to educate cadres. Guo Hua, the secretary of the District Committee, had individual talks with more than 60 cadres and members in a year. Wang Lianwu was not very enthusiastic about his work because there was a backward member in his cooperative. After Guo Hua found out, he talked to him three times and helped him educate the backward member. (6) Village cadres participate in the cooperative's experience summary meeting, and the village branch sends branch committee members to participate in the leadership work of the cooperative.
    The Eighth District Committee conscientiously implemented the Party's policy of "only allowing success, not failure" in the trial work, and was determined to run each cooperative well. They realized that to run an agricultural production cooperative well, the following tasks must be done well: (1) Strictly grasp the conditions for establishing a cooperative. If the conditions for establishing a cooperative are not met, do not do it. Wait until the conditions are ripe before doing it. (2) Promote advanced cultivation experience and strive to produce more grain. According to the statistics of the seven cooperatives, the area of cultivated land that has adopted the Zhaoyuan County equidistant, wide sowing, and close planting experience accounts for 30 percent. The grain in these areas is more than that of the mutual aid teams. This has set an example for the establishment of cooperatives in 1954. (3) Cultivate and educate the cadres of the cooperative, and do a good job in democratic management and income distribution. (4) Strengthen political and ideological education, especially the education of collectivism.
    The Eighth District Committee also paid attention to using the work of the cooperative to promote and influence the work of the mutual aid teams. At the beginning of summer weeding, the mutual aid teams had no confidence in thinning the widely sown millet. The district organized more than 200 mutual aid team leaders to visit the thinning work of the agricultural production cooperatives. After the visit, many mutual aid teams thinned the seedlings. The cadres of the mutual aid teams reflected: "The cooperative is a model for our progress. Wherever the cooperative goes, we will follow." As a result, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the whole district has greatly developed. At present, the farmers organized in the whole district have reached 87 percent of the farmers in the district. Among the 192 mutual aid teams, there are 118 year-round teams, and most of the mutual aid teams have implemented mutually beneficial policies.

### 中共蛟河县第八区委领导农业生产合作社的经验

    中共蛟河县第八区委领导农业生产合作社的经验
    中共吉林省蛟河县第八区区委所领导的七个农业生产合作社都办得很好。虽然一九五三年这些社的自然条件不好，雨水过多，草苗齐长，但是庄稼仍然长得很好，打的粮食都比互助组多。这些社所以办得好，是和第八区区委的领导分不开的。
    第八区区委在一九五三年开始办社时，首先注意了端正领导思想。当时，一部分干部中存在着急躁冒进情绪，这是因为有些干部看到一九五二年试办的俄青林农业生产合作社能多打粮食，每个劳动日可以分配到九十四斤高粱，所以主张来个大发展。也有些干部认为办社不容易暂时不搞合作社。第八区区委针对这些思想情况，领导大家学习了中共中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”，明确认识了积极领导稳步前进和只准办好不准办坏的方针；又具体研究了试办俄青林社的经验。这使干部初步弄清了急躁冒进和消极等待思想都是不符合党的方针的。这时，第八区区委就根据八区的具体情况，确定了再试办六个农业生产合作社。在试办中，区委还进一步纠正了干部的急躁冒进情绪和其他缺点，使试办工作顺利进行。
    在试办中，第八区区委采用了突破一点、推动一般的领导方法。第八区区委以俄青林社为工作基点，一切工作，先在俄青林社试行，取得经验后，再进行推广。这个基点，由区委书记郭华亲自领导。第八区区委的推广经验的办法是：（一）组织参观。一九五三年第八区区委曾六次组织各社主任和互助组长参观俄青林社实行宽播、间苗、包工制等先进的耕作和管理方法的情形。在组织参观前都做了充分的准备工作，所以参观的时间不长，但是效果很好。参观的人都很满意，并愿按照俄青林社的经验来做。（二）召开各社干部会议总结与交流经验。一九五三年春耕开始时，有些社只注意副业生产，忽视了农业生产。第八区区委就召开会议，请俄青林向大家介绍了以经营农业为主增加收入的经验。（三）组织报告会。第八区区委有组织有计划地请俄青林到各社报告他们的工作经验，对各社的工作推动很大。当俄青林介绍了社员爱护公共财产和关心社的工作情况后，其他合作社的社员就都自觉地检讨了不关心社的思想。
    第八区区委知道要办好合作社，必须在合作社内培养出一批骨干分子，因此在日常工作中就比较注意培养干部。当区委发现有些区干部包办代替合作社的工作时，立即指出区干部的责任是帮助社的干部及时发现和解决社的问题，以及检查工作，总结经验。区委纠正了区干部包办代替的作风以后，这些社的工作就有了显著的进展。社的干部也都满意地说：“有解决不了的问题，区上就来帮助解决，合作社办好了，咱们的工作能力也提高了，真是一举两得。”现全区已培养了五十多名比较熟悉农业生产合作社业务的干部。这给今后发展和巩固农业生产合作社的工作打下了较好的基础。
    如何培养干部呢？第八区区委采取了这样几个方法：（一）结合当前工作进行政策教育。开始建立合作社时，着重进行了建社和经营方针的教育，夏锄时进行了民主管理的教育，秋收后又进行了收益分配的教育。这样就迅速地提高了干部的觉悟和政策水平，对当前工作起了指导作用。（二）区干部注意帮助干部发现和解决各种问题。区委书记郭华经常和合作社社员在一起劳动，了解社员的思想和社中的问题。有一次郭华和尹久胜的?地组一起干活，就了解到有些社员对于现在的牲口使用的方法有意见，并已开始影响到他们的生产积极性。当天晚上，郭华就把这个问题反映给社的领导干部，由社的领导干部召开了生产管理委员会，讨论改进了牲口使用方法。（三）注意帮助社的干部检查工作，总结经验，制订工作计划。第八区区委曾帮助俄青林社总结了用好坏典型事例进行思想教育的经验。这一经验对于巩固合作社起了很大的作用。（四）召开社主任会议，交流管理经验。一九五三年春夏两季区委曾召开了两次会议，着重交流了包工制和民主管理的经验，对于干部的提高有很大的启发作用。（五）采用个别谈话的方式来教育干部。区委书记郭华在一年中曾和六十多个干部、社员进行了个别谈话。王连武因为自己社内有一个落后社员，工作就很不起劲。郭华发现后就和他谈了三次话，并帮助他教育了那个落后社员。（六）村干部参加合作社总结经验的会议，村支部派支部委员参加合作社的领导工作。
    第八区区委在试办工作中认真执行了党的“只准办好，不准办坏”的方针，决心把每一个社都办好。他们体会到：要办好一个农业生产合作社，必须做好以下几项工作：（一）严格掌握建社条件，不够建社条件就不办，等条件成熟后再办。（二）推广先进的耕作经验，争取多打粮食。据七个社的统计：已采用肇源县等距、宽播、密植经验的耕地面积有百分之三十，这些地的粮食都比互助组打得多。这就给一九五四年的建社工作树立了榜样。
  （三）培养和教育社的干部，作好民主管理工作和收益分配等工作。（四）加强政治思想教育工作，特别是集体主义的教育。
    第八区区委还注意用社的工作来推动和影响互助组的工作。夏锄开始时，各互助组对宽播的谷子间苗没有信心，区里就组织了二百多个互助组长去参观农业生产合作社的间苗工作。参观以后，许多互助组都间苗了。互助组的干部反映说：“合作社是我们前进的榜样，合作社到那里去，我们就跟到那里去。”全区互助合作运动因而有了很大的发展。现全区组织起来的农户已达全区农户的百分之八十七。在一百九十二个互助组中有一百十八个常年组，大部分互助组执行了互利政策。
