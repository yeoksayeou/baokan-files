State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives across the country have prepared a large quantity of non-staple foods for the Spring Festival to meet the needs of the people to celebrate the festival joyfully.

In Beijing, state-owned and private shops, as well as cooperatives, have been crowded with customers in recent days. In front of the counters of the retail department of the State-owned Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company and the cloth and children's toy departments of the State-owned Department Store, housewives and children are carefully selecting beautiful cloth samples and discussing the purchase of various toys with their children. Salesmen of household goods in department stores and cooperatives are often overwhelmed by customers. The Spring Festival non-staple foods that state-owned commercial and cooperative departments in Shanghai have transferred or purchased from production areas are being transported to Shanghai in large quantities from all directions by train, ship, and automobile. Since January 9, the Shanghai East Railway Station has been carrying out the loading and unloading of Spring Festival materials. Since the 15th, the number of train carriages arriving at the East Railway Station every day has increased by one-third compared with usual, most of which are Spring Festival non-staple foods transported from various places.

With the increase in people's purchasing power, the quantity of Spring Festival materials prepared by state-owned commercial departments, cooperatives, and private shops in various places this year exceeds that of previous years. There has also been an increase in variety. The amount of pork to be supplied in Beijing during the Spring Festival will increase by 43.8 percent compared with the same period last year. The state-owned trading companies and cooperative stores in Beijing have a complete range of dried goods such as dried shrimp, red dates, dried fungus, and daylily, as well as various fruits, pastries, and candies. The city's cooperatives have also prepared various vegetables, Nanjing pressed duck, Sichuan cured meat, Xinjiang raisins, and assorted southern candies. The amount of pork prepared by state-owned commercial departments in Shanghai before the Spring Festival this year increased by 32 to 46 percent compared with the actual sales volume in the same period last year, chicken increased by 40 percent, and fish increased by 132 percent; the Spring Festival material supply plan of the city's cooperatives this year increased by 171 percent compared with the same period last year. The Shanghai Department Store has increased the variety of food supplied by nearly 300 kinds, and the company's first store has a full range of cakes and breads this year. In addition to preparing various seafood fish, the Aquatic Products Company also plans to transfer 60,000 jin of prawns from Qingdao to Shanghai. Cooperatives have added more than ten varieties of sweet potato vermicelli, dried vegetables, dried fish, and duck gizzards. The supply of Spring Festival non-staple foods in Tianjin has also increased compared with last year. For example, the supply of pork has increased by more than 33 percent, chickens and ducks have increased by 71 percent compared with last year, and fresh fish has increased by 77 percent. The vegetables operated by the city's retail company have increased from less than 20 kinds to 52 kinds. Cooperatives have added goods such as sea cucumber, bamboo shoots, abalone, and Cantonese preserved meat. In addition to preparing general vegetables, the local specialty and non-staple food company has also purchased a large number of fine vegetables such as cucumbers, eggplants, and tomatoes from Guangzhou and other places. The supply of live pigs in Guangzhou this Spring Festival has increased by 16 percent, and chickens, geese, and ducks have increased by 33 percent. The Guangzhou Retail Company and the Cooperative General Store have purchased a large number of chickens, geese, and ducks, and are carrying out a large amount of processing and pickling of festive commodities such as preserved duck. The local product company system in the Northeast region has prepared 120,000 live pigs, and the amount to be supplied during the Spring Festival is equal to four and a half times the actual sales volume in the New Year. In addition, more than 19,900 cattle, 9.22 million eggs, and various other vegetables have been prepared, and the reserves are sufficient to supply until the end of the first quarter. The provincial companies under the Northwest Trading Company system have stockpiled a large number of pigs, sheep, and various preserved meats based on regional and ethnic conditions for the supply of meat to large cities and industrial and mining areas, and continue to organize purchases. The meat stored by the Altai and Dushanzi Mining Area Trading Companies in Xinjiang Province can guarantee supply after the Spring Festival.

In rural areas, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have also recently prepared a large number of New Year goods. In addition to meat and fish, there are also sugar, dried and fresh fruits, five-spice seasonings, New Year paintings, Spring Festival couplets on red paper, and firecrackers; a large number of floral fabrics, as well as bowls, chopsticks, and daily necessities are also supplied for farmers to celebrate the Spring Festival after selling surplus grain or cash crops. In cash crop areas, a large number of flour, rice, and miscellaneous grains have also been transferred to ensure supply.

In order to facilitate citizens and cooperative members to purchase, state-owned companies and district consumer cooperatives have made appropriate adjustments and deployments in terms of supply locations, business hours, and sales procedures. State-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives in Beijing have accepted consumers' opinions and evenly supplied consumer goods to residents throughout the city, and have recently added consumer goods supply outlets. The First Retail Department of the Shanghai Local Products Company has set up a customer service center in the mall to accept pre-orders or deliver goods on behalf of customers. The City Retail Company has selected 24 retail stores to supply Spring Festival non-staple foods. Cooperatives conducted New Year's goods registration for members in advance, and these days, various New Year's goods are being delivered to members one after another according to plan.

　　准备大量副食品供应春节需要
    全国各地国营商业部门和合作社，已准备了大量的春节副食品，供应人民欢度春节的需要。
    北京市内各国营和私营商店以及合作社，近日来已顾客盈门。国营花纱布公司零售部和国营百货公司布匹部、儿童玩具部的柜台前，拥挤着家庭主妇和儿童，她们细心挑选美观的布样，并同孩子们商量着购买各种玩具。百货公司和合作社的家庭用具的售货员，照顾顾客经常应接不暇。上海市国营商业和合作社部门向产地调运或采购的春节副食品，正通过火车、轮船、汽车，从四面八方大量运到上海。一月九日以来，上海东车站一直进行着春节物资的装卸工作。从十五日起，每天到东车站的车皮，比往常增加了三分之一，其中大部分是各地载运来的春节副食品。
    随着人民购买力的提高，今年各地国营商业部门和合作社及私营商店准备的春节物资供应数量，都超过了往年。在品种上也有增加。北京市春节期间准备供应的猪肉量比去年同期增加百分之四十三点八。北京市的国营贸易公司和合作社的门市部陈列的海米、红枣、木耳、黄花菜等干货和各种水果以及各种糕点、糖果，都很齐全。市合作社还准备了各种蔬菜、南京板鸭、四川咸肉、新疆葡萄干以及什锦南糖。上海市国营商业部门今年春节前准备的猪肉比去年同期实销数增加百分之三十二到四十六，鸡增加百分之四十，鱼增加百分之一百三十二；市合作社今年春节物资供应计划比去年同期增加了百分之一百七十一。上海市百货公司供应的食品品种增加了近三百种，该公司第一商店今年各式蛋糕面包都齐备。水产公司除准备各种海鲜鱼外，还准备向青岛调运对虾六万斤来上海。合作社增加了土粉丝、干菜、鱼干、鸭肫肝等十余种。天津市的春节副食品供应量也比去年增加。如猪肉供应量增加百分之三十三以上，鸡鸭比去年增加百分之七十一，鲜鱼增加了百分之七十七。市零售公司经营的蔬菜由不满二十种增加到五十二种。合作社增加了海参、冬笋、鲍鱼、广东腊味等货品。土产副食品公司除准备一般菜蔬外，还从广州等地买到大量黄瓜、茄子、西红柿等细菜。广州市今年春节生猪供应量增加百分之十六，鸡、鹅、鸭增加百分之三十三。广州市零售公司和合作总社已购进大量鸡、鹅、鸭，并进行大量加工腌制腊鸭等应节商品。东北区土产公司系统已准备十二万头生猪，春节期间准备供应的就等于新年实销数的四倍半。此外还准备一万九千九百多条牛、九百二十二万个鸡蛋和其他各种蔬菜，其储备量足够供应到第一季末。西北贸易公司系统所属各省公司对大城市及工矿区的肉食供应，各地已根据地区及民族等条件分别储备大批猪、羊及各种腊味，并继续组织采购。新疆省阿山及独山子矿区贸易公司储备的肉食，可以保证供应到春节以后。
    在农村，国营商业部门和供销合作社最近也大量准备年货，除了肉类、鱼类外，还有糖、干鲜果品、五香调料、新年画、对联红纸、鞭炮等；还供应大批花布、以及碗筷日常用品，供应农民在出售余粮或经济作物后欢度春节之用。在经济作物区，还调进了大批面粉、大米和杂粮，保证供应。
    为了便利市民及合作社社员们选购，各国营公司及各区消费合作社在供应地点、营业时间、销售手续等方面都作了适当的调整和部署。北京市国营商业和合作社接受消费者意见，均衡地供应全城居民消费品，最近增设了消费品供应门市部。上海市土产公司第一门市部在商场内设立了顾客服务处，接受预购或代客送货。市零售公司选择了二十四个零售商店，供应春节副食品。合作社事前对社员进行了年货登记，这几天各种年货正按计划陆续送到社员手里。
