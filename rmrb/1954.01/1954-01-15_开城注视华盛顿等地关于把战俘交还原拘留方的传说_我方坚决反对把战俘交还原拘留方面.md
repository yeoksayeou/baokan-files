[Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 13th] News reports from Washington and New Delhi are being closely watched here, stating that POWs who are not directly repatriated will be handed over to their original detaining parties. Well-informed sources say that the Korean and Chinese side firmly opposes this action, which violates the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement, by handing over POWs under the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to their original detaining parties.

If Korean and Chinese POWs are handed over to the US side, it means cruelly sending a large number of Korean and Chinese POWs who wish to return home into the hands of their enemies to suffer torture and massacre. The US military authorities are stepping up military preparations to immediately hand these POWs over to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek of Taiwan once they fall into their hands, to serve as cannon fodder. At the same time, the Rhee and Chiang bandit gangs have long declared that they will "eliminate" POWs who wish to be repatriated.

The "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" has already shown that, under the direction of the United Nations Command, special agent terrorist organizations are preventing South Korean POWs from being repatriated. More than 500 Korean and Chinese POWs who escaped from this reign of terror back to Kaesong have confirmed that many Korean and Chinese POWs requested repatriation, but because the US side unilaterally terminated the explanatory work and instructed special agents to use force, threats of force, and murder, these POWs could not be repatriated.

    开城注视华盛顿等地关于把战俘交还原拘留方的传说
    我方坚决反对把战俘交还原拘留方面
    【新华社开城十三日电】这里正密切注视着来自华盛顿和新德里的这样的新闻报道：不直接遣返战俘将被交还原拘留方面。消息灵通人士说：朝中方面坚决反对这样违反朝鲜停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，把在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘交还给原拘留一方的行动。
    如果把朝中战俘交还美方，那就是说，把希望回家的大批朝中战俘残酷地送到他们敌人的手中去遭受酷刑和屠杀。美国军事当局已在加紧进行军事准备，以便在这些战俘一旦落入他们手中的时候，立刻把他们移交给李承晚和台湾的蒋介石，去充当炮灰，同时李蒋匪帮也早已宣布要把愿意遣返的战俘“消灭掉”。
    “中立国遣返委员会临时报告”中已表明：在联合国军方面的指使下，特务恐怖组织正阻止着南营朝中战俘获得遣返。从这种恐怖统治下逃回开城的五百多名朝中战俘证实了：许多朝中战俘是要求遣返的，可是由于美方片面终止了解释工作，并指使特务施行武力、武力威胁和谋杀，这些战俘都不能得到遣返。
