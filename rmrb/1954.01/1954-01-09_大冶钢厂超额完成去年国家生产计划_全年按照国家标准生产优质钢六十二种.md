The workers of the Daye Steel Plant of the Central China Iron and Steel Company victoriously overfulfilled last year's national production plan, while also completing the total production value plan, sales plan, and profit remittance plan. Regarding the production plan, the main products were completed as follows: steel ingots at 105.59%, pig iron at 102.12%, ordinary steel at 105.13%, and high-quality steel at 101.17%.

The Daye Steel Plant began focusing on the production of high-quality steel in 1953. Initially, due to a lack of experience in technology and management, the production of high-quality steel was very poor. Workshops did not follow order plans, produced blindly, and the quality was very low. The plant only completed 8.7% of orders in the first quarter of last year, and the cost was extremely high, so only 8% of the profit remittance plan was completed in the first quarter. In order to reverse this bad situation, the plant's leadership took the following measures:

First, technical difficulties were overcome with the direct help of Soviet experts. In June of last year, Soviet experts Zhuyev and Czech expert Garov personally came to the factory to guide and put forward 24 major items and 161 suggestions. The inspection team of the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, helped the Daye Steel Plant revise the operating procedures and solve the problem of imbalance between the quality of high-quality steel and the equipment in the processing workshop. In October of last year, Soviet expert Naidovsky came to the factory to help successfully smelt high-quality steel in open-hearth furnaces. At that time, the forging workshop was originally the weakest link in the entire plant. Also, due to the implementation of the Soviet advanced experience of "high-temperature charging, rapid heating, and assembly line operations," production was significantly improved, and the production task of the fourth quarter, which was more than the total production of the previous three quarters, was successfully completed. The qualification rate of five types of high-alloy steel and multi-element alloy steel, such as high-speed steel and die steel, which require high smelting technology, reached a very high level, and two of them even reached Soviet special standards. Open-hearth furnaces have also successively smelted 15 types of low-cost high-quality steel.

Second, planning management was strengthened, and shift operation plans and dispatching work were implemented. Since August of last year, due to the implementation of planning management, the leading cadres of the Daye Steel Plant have been able to discover and solve key problems in production in a timely manner. For example, after the production capacity of the processing workshop increased, the supply of steel ingots could not keep up, and there were frequent shutdowns and waiting for materials. The plant immediately strengthened the leadership of the smelting department and appointed a deputy director to concurrently serve as the director of the electric furnace workshop, and adopted technical measures such as expanding the furnace bottom and implementing hot charging, which changed the imbalance and improved the production of steel ingots. Another example is that various workshops did not pay attention to the warehousing of finished products, resulting in a large backlog and disconnection from production. The heat treatment workshop alone had a backlog of high-quality steel accounting for 20% of the total annual production. After discovering this problem, the plant leaders first urged the heat treatment workshop to clean up, and implemented a system throughout the plant where the amount of product warehousing was the basis for assessing the completion of the plan, which greatly shortened the production cycle and eliminated false figures for the completion of the plan. At the same time, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau successively helped the plant overcome the chaos in finance, labor organization, and other areas, so that the plant's management work gradually got on the right track.

Third, starting from the end of September last year, all the workers of the plant launched a production increase and economy practice centered on implementing the operation plan, and put forward rationalization proposals, which guaranteed the completion of the production plan. The iron-smelting workshop had failed to complete the production plan for three consecutive months last year, which caused great difficulties in completing the annual plan. Later, in the labor emulation, engineer Li Shufeng and others took the lead in learning the advanced experience of the Soviet "edge charging method" and "reducing coke specifications," completed the annual production plan, and created eight national new records. The workers in the rolling mill workshop put forward more than 250 rationalization proposals in the fourth quarter, and independently implemented more than 60 of them, so that the workshop's annual production increase and economy practice plan could be completed ten days ahead of schedule.

Due to the above measures, the Daye Steel Plant has produced and shipped 62 types of high-quality steel in accordance with national standards throughout the year, exceeding the annual production plan by 109%. This has played a major role in directly supporting the construction of hundreds of factories, mines, and national defense projects across the country, such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Jixi Mining Bureau, Hankou Automobile Manufacturing and Assembly Plant, Changsha Machine Tool Plant, and Tianjin and Qingdao Textile Factories.

The Daye Steel Plant's production tasks this year are even more significant than last year: the total production value plan has increased by 37%, the labor productivity plan has increased by 36%, the alloy steel plan has increased by 1.7 times, and the cost plan has been reduced by 9.24%. After studying the general line, all the workers of the plant are full of confidence in ensuring the completion of the 1954 production tasks. They wrote to Chairman Mao to express their determination to strive to complete the tasks.

### 大冶钢厂超额完成去年国家生产计划  全年按照国家标准生产优质钢六十二种

    大冶钢厂超额完成去年国家生产计划
    全年按照国家标准生产优质钢六十二种
    华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂职工胜利地超额完成了去年的国家生产计划，同时完成了生产总值计划、销货计划与上缴利润计划。在生产计划方面，主要产品钢锭完成百分之一百零五点五九，生铁完成百分之一百零二点一二，普通钢材完成百分之一百零五点一三，优质钢材完成百分之一百零一点一七。
    大冶钢厂从一九五三年开始以生产优质钢为主。起初，由于技术上与管理上缺乏经验，优质钢的生产情况很不好。车间不按订货计划，盲目生产，质量很低。该厂去年第一季度仅完成订货百分之八点七，而且成本极高，因此第一季度仅完成上缴利润计划百分之八。为了扭转这个不好的局面，该厂领导方面采取如下的措施：
    第一、在苏联专家直接帮助下，克服技术上的困难。去年六月间，苏联专家朱也夫与捷克加洛夫亲自到厂指导，提出了二十四大项和一百六十一条建议。中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局检查组根据苏联专家建议帮助大冶钢厂改订操作规程，解决优质钢质量与加工车间设备不平衡的问题。去年十月份，苏联专家纳依道夫斯基来厂帮助平炉冶炼优质钢成功。当时，锻造车间原是全厂最薄弱的环节，也由于贯彻了苏联先进经验“高温装料、快速加热、流水作业”，使生产显著提高，顺利完成了比前三个季度生产总和还多的第四季度的生产任务。锋钢、冲模钢等五种需要高度冶炼技术的高合金钢与多元合金钢的合格率达到了很高的水平，有两种还达到了苏联特殊标准。平炉也先后冶炼出成本低廉的优质钢十五种。
    第二、加强计划管理，实行轮班作业计划与调度工作。从去年八月份开始，由于实行了计划管理，大冶钢厂领导干部便能及时发现与解决生产上的关键问题。如加工车间生产能力提高以后，钢锭供应不上，时常有停工待料现象发生，该厂立即加强对冶炼部门的领导，并派一副厂长兼任电炉车间主任，采取了扩大炉底、施行热装料等技术措施，改变了不平衡的现象，提高了钢锭生产。又如各车间不注意成品入库，造成大量积压与生产脱节的现象，单是热处理车间就积压了占全年生产总量百分之二十的优质钢材。该厂领导方面发现这个问题后，首先督促热处理车间进行清理，并在全厂实行了产品入库量为考核完成计划依据的制度，大大缩短了生产周期，并消灭了完成计划的虚假数字。与此同时，中央重工业部与钢铁工业管理局又先后帮助该厂克服了财务、劳动组织等混乱现象，使该厂管理工作逐步走上正轨。
    第三、全厂职工从去年九月底起展开了以贯彻作业计划为中心的增产节约竞赛，并提出了合理化建议，保证了生产计划的完成。炼铁车间去年有三个月连续没完成生产计划，给完成全年计划造成很大困难，后来在劳动竞赛中，由工程师李纾丰等带头学习苏联的“边缘装料法”与“改小焦炭规格”的先进经验，完成了全年生产计划，并创造了八次全国新纪录。轧钢车间职工在第四季度中先后提出了二百五十多条合理化建议，并自行实现了六十多条，使车间全年的增产节约计划得以提前十天完成。
    由于采取上面这些措施，大冶钢厂一年来先后按国家标准生产和出厂的优质钢达六十二种，超额完成全年生产计划百分之一百零九。这在直接支援鞍山钢铁公司、鸡西矿务局、汉口汽车制配厂、长沙机床厂、天津与青岛纺织厂等全国各地数百个工厂矿山和国防工程的建设中，起了很大作用。
    大冶钢厂今年的生产任务比去年更为重大：生产总值计划提高百分之三十七，劳动生产率计划提高百分之三十六，合金钢计划提高一点七倍，成本计划减低百分之九点二四。全厂职工自学习总路线后，满怀信心地保证完成一九五四年的生产任务。他们写信给毛主席表示了努力完成任务的决心。
