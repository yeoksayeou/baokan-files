    General Line Propaganda Promotes Rural Production
      A New Atmosphere Appears
    After receiving education on the General Line, peasants in Dongshan Town, Qin Huai, Yangqiao and other townships in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, enthusiastically engaged in winter production, and a new atmosphere prevailed in the countryside. In Yijiawei, Dongshan Town, it was originally planned to use 740 man-days to repair it in ten sunny days. After the first day of publicizing the General Line, the number of people working on the embankment increased from more than 80 to more than 130 on the second day. The Xujiawei jointly repaired by the first and second villages of Qin Huai Township originally planned to use only 320 workers for winter repairs this winter, but the peasants met the predetermined requirements within three days, and proposed a new plan to repair another 320 workers. Wang Minsheng, the head of the voter group in the second village, said when discussing the new plan: "If the embankment is repaired firmly, the mutual aid group is doing well, and everyone is working hard, we can see the good days of socialism." After the comprehensive publicity of the General Line in the whole township from December 11 last year, the first round of winter plowing (weeding wheat) of wheat fields had been almost completed by December 18. After studying the General Line, the peasants in Yangqiao Township increased the number of peasants working on the embankment from more than 200 to more than 600 every day. The cadres lead the masses in production during the day, and lead the peasants in studying the General Line in the villages at night. They said: "After studying the General Line, everyone is full of energy and must do a good job in agricultural production to support national construction."
    Enthusiastically Launch Winter Production
    After listening to the General Line propaganda, the peasants in Zhongzhuo Township, Changli County, Hebei Province, not only improved their understanding of mutual assistance and cooperation, but also set off a winter production upsurge. The mutual aid group led by Miao Jingui, deputy secretary of the township branch, finally turned into a production cooperative with the help of Li Jun, a model agricultural laborer after more than ten days of preparation. The number of permanent mutual aid groups in the township has developed from seven to thirty-six, accounting for 57.6% of the total number of households in the township. On the basis of being organized, the whole township launched a warm winter production: rolling wheat fields, watering, accumulating fertilizer, pulling sand to change the soil, and engaging in sideline production such as weaving. Party members and cadres grasped the leadership of production while publicizing the General Line. For example, Yang Shoutian, a party member in Zhongzhuo Village, helped six severely affected households including Tian Shunfang to organize mutual aid groups for sideline production. Su Zhenhan, the deputy township head, helped Zeng Guangqing and other sixteen households in Liu Lizhuang to formulate agricultural and sideline production plans, which the peasants were very satisfied with.

      Collective Addition of Carts and Horses
    After being educated on the General Line, the peasants in Henghe Natural Village, the third district of the suburbs of Taiyuan City, have a high enthusiasm for production and participation in mutual assistance and cooperation. The peasants in the village originally planned to sell more than 19,000 catties of grain to the state by December 24 last year, but they overfulfilled the task on the 14th, selling a total of more than 32,000 catties of grain. Everyone plans to invest the money earned from selling grain into production. Fourteen of the twenty-eight households in the village have collectively invested in buying carts and horses to pull manure in Taiyuan city. Because of the public property, coupled with the benefits of being organized in recent years, they voluntarily formed mutual aid groups. Now they have pulled twenty-eight carts of manure from Taiyuan City and are preparing to continue accumulating fertilizer to prepare conditions for increasing grain production next year. (Ma Junfa)
    All Villagers Prepare to Join Cooperatives and Groups
    After receiving education on the General Line, the masses in Taipingzhuang Village, Twelfth Village, Bayantala Nurtuk (District), Kezuo Middle Banner, Eastern Inner Mongolia, have a further understanding of the prospects for agricultural production development, and their demands for participation in mutual assistance and cooperation are very urgent. The Zhao Qifu mutual aid group is brewing to turn into a production cooperative. Group member Zhao Qigui said: "When the cooperative is established, we will definitely work harder." Group member Li Guomin is calculating how to invest more in the cooperative to make the cooperative stronger. He said: "Cooperatives are stronger than mutual aid groups and closer to socialism. We must work hard. After selling the grain, I can invest 1.4 million yuan in the cooperative. In the future, the money earned from sideline production will also be invested together so that the cooperative can expand production." Wang Zhen and Cao Fenglai, two seasonal mutual aid groups, are planning to turn into permanent mutual aid groups. The only three or four individual farmers in the village are also planning to participate in mutual assistance and cooperation organizations. After selling the grain, the peasants plan to use the money for production. According to the survey, Zhao Qifu and other five households alone will buy two carts, three horses, one donkey, and two cows. The entire village has now purchased six carts, twelve horses, one mule, and ten cattle and donkeys. (Chen Fuying)
      Invest the Money from Selling Grain into Production
    After enthusiastically selling grain, the peasants in Yilan County, Songjiang Province, have made reasonable use of the money from selling grain to expand reproduction. The county has purchased 1,038 horses and 314 carts. However, these still cannot meet the needs of the peasants. In previous years, the carts stockpiled in the iron factories could not be sold, but now they cannot keep up with the needs of the peasants. After listening to the General Line propaganda, the masses felt that they had a goal, and their enthusiasm for production was very high. An army-supporting model in the Eleventh District said: "The country wants industrialization, and it is useless for us to keep the money at home. Invest more in the land, grow more grain, and support industry, then we will get to socialism faster." Now the peasants engaged in sideline production in the county have earned more than 1.5 billion yuan and are preparing to invest in agricultural production. Many peasants said: This time we have to work hard and learn from the Xinghuo Collective Farm, and there is nothing wrong with taking that path. (Sun Bingren)
      The Enthusiasm for Production is Even Greater
    After vigorously publicizing the General Line in Yuanjia Village, Dalu Township, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has been high. The village now has 1,250 mu of grass seed fields, an increase of 150 mu compared with 1952. In the past, fertilizer was applied three times, but now it is planned to apply fertilizer four times. So far, more than 80% of the grass seed fields in the village have been fertilized twice, some have been fertilized three times, and some have been covered with grass to prevent frost and built dams to prevent flooding. The enthusiasm of the masses for cultivating green manure is very high. Many people go to the city every day to carry rice husks and ashes and collect pig manure to apply to the grass seed fields. Peasant Fu Qiufa walked six or seven miles and picked up a load of pig manure in half a day. The brothers Lu Chenggui take turns picking up pig manure whenever they are free, at least one load a day. Yuan Shousong, the director of the village representative, and peasants Yang Xiaomao and Yuan Yueqiao, etc., have been dredging pond mud for fourteen consecutive days to improve sandy soil, totaling 28 mu. They said: "Dredging mud in sandy fields can increase production by at least 100 to 150 catties of grain." They also plan to continue improving the soil this spring to achieve "muddy fields dredging sand, sandy fields dredging mud, in order to exploit the potential of land production." The farmland water conservancy projects in the village include six small pits and three large pits (each 500 zhang long), which draw water from the Puyang River to irrigate the fields. Recently, after studying the General Line, the masses in the village decided to repair all the large and small pits. The new canal pit, 500 zhang long, which the village originally planned to complete in four hundred man-days and two days, was completed in only one and a half days, saving a large amount of manpower. Now the masses have started to repair the second large pit. (Wu Yungao)

    总路线宣传推动了农村生产
      出现一片新气象
    江苏省江宁县一区东山镇和秦淮、洋桥等乡农民受到了总路线的教育以后，都热烈地投入冬季生产，农村里到处呈现着一片新气象。东山镇的易家圩，原来计划用七百四十个人工在十个晴天内把它修好，第一天宣传总路线以后，第二天上圩的人数就从八十多人增加到一百三十多人。秦淮乡一、二村合修的徐家圩，原计划去冬只用三百二十个工进行冬修，但农民在三天内冬修就达到了预定的要求，又提出再修三百二十个工的新计划。二村选民小组长王敏生在讨论新计划时说：“圩堤修牢，互助组搞好，大家出劲干，社会主义的好日子就望得见了。”全乡从去年十二月十一日全面宣传总路线后，到十二月十八日止，第一遍麦田冬耕（锄麦）工作已经做得差不多了。洋桥乡农民在学习总路线以后，每天上圩的农民由二百多人增加到六百多人，干部白天领导群众生产，晚上分村领导农民学习总路线。他们说：“学习了总路线，大家浑身来了劲，一定要把农业生产搞好，支持国家建设。”
    热烈展开冬季生产
    河北省昌黎县中卓乡农民听了总路线宣传，不但提高了对互助合作的认识，而且掀起了冬季生产热潮。该乡支部副书记苗金贵领导的互助组，经过十几天的准备工作，终于在农业劳动模范李俊的帮助下转成生产合作社。全乡并由七个常年互助组发展到三十六个，占全乡总户数的百分之五十七点六。在组织起来的基础上，全乡就展开了热烈的冬季生产：轧麦田、浇水、积肥、拉沙子改变土壤，以及搞编织等副业生产。党员、干部在宣传总路线中，同时抓紧生产领导。如中卓庄党员杨守田曾帮助田顺芳等六户重灾户，组织互助组进行副业生产。副乡长苏振汉帮助刘李庄曾光清等十六户订了农副业生产计划，农民感到很满意。

      集体添车买马
    太原市郊区第三区横河自然村的农民，受到总路线教育以后，生产和参加互助合作的热情很高。该村农民预定到去年十二月二十四日止，卖给国家粮食一万九千多斤，但到十四日就超额完成任务，共卖了粮食三万二千多斤。大家都打算把卖粮后得到的钱投入生产。全村二十八户中已有十四户集体投资买车马到太原城里拉粪。由于有了公共财产，加以这几年来亲眼看到了组织起来的好处，他们就自愿组成互助组。现在他们已经从太原城里拉了二十八大车粪，并准备继续积肥，为明年增产粮食准备条件。　（马骏发）
    全屯农民准备入社入组
    内蒙古东部区科左中旗巴彦他拉努图克（区）十二村太平庄屯群众，受到总路线教育以后，对农业生产发展的前途有了进一步的认识，参加互助合作的要求很迫切。赵起福互助组正在酝酿转为生产合作社。组员赵起贵说：“成立了社，干起活来准得更起劲。”组员李国民盘算着怎样能多投资到合作社，使合作社的力量更壮大。他说：“合作社比互助组强，离社会主义更近了，我们一定要努力干。卖了粮后，我可以投资到合作社一百四十万元。往后搞副业赚的钱，也一起投进去，以便社里扩大生产。”王珍和曹风来两个季节性互助组正打算转为常年互助组。全屯仅有的三、四户单干农民，也都打算着要参加到互助合作组织中去。农民在卖粮以后，都计划把钱用到生产上去。据调查，只是赵起福等五户，就要买进二台车、三匹马、一头驴、两头牛。全屯现在已经买进六台大车、十二匹马、一头骡子，还有十头牛和驴。　（陈馥英）
      把卖粮的钱投入生产
    松江省依兰县农民在踊跃卖粮后，都把卖粮的钱作合理使用，扩大再生产。全县已经买进一千零三十八匹马，三百一十四台大车。但是这些还不能满足农民的需要。往年铁工厂积压的大车卖不出去，而现在则赶不上农民的需要。群众在听了总路线宣传后，都感到有了奔头了，生产劲头很大。十一区一个拥军模范说：“国家要工业化，咱们把钱放在家里也没用处，多在地里投资，多打粮，支援工业，那咱们到社会主义就更快了。”现在全县搞副业的农民已经收入十五亿多元，准备投入农业生产。许多农民都表示：这回可得好好干了，向星火集体农庄学习，走那条道没错。　（孙秉仁）
      生产劲头更大了
    浙江诸暨县大侣乡袁家村大张旗鼓宣传总路线后，群众生产情绪高涨。该村现在共有草籽田一千二百五十亩，比一九五二年增加一百五十亩，以往施肥三次，现在准备施肥四次。到目前止全村百分之八十以上草籽田已施完二遍肥，有一部分已施三次，有的并在草籽田内盖草防霜，打坝以防水淹。群众培植绿肥的劲头很大，每天都有很多人进城挑砻糠灰，拾猪粪，施到草籽田去。农民傅邱法走了六七里路，半天拾一担猪粪。陆承桂兄弟俩一空下来就轮流拾猪粪，一天至少一担。村代表主任袁寿松和农民杨小毛、袁岳乔等一连捞了十四天塘泥，改良沙田土壤计二十八亩，他们说：“沙田挑泥，至少可增产一百斤到一百五十斤谷。”他们还准备今春再继续改良土壤，做到“泥田挑沙，沙田挑泥，以发挥土地生产潜能。”该村农田水利工程，共有小坑六条，大坑三条（每条长五百丈），是引浦阳江的水来灌溉田亩的。最近，学习总路线后，全村群众决定把大小坑都整修一次，该村原计划化四百个工、两天完成的一条五百丈长的新圳坑，只一天半就完工，还节省了大批人力。现在群众又开始修第二条大坑了。　（吴云高）
