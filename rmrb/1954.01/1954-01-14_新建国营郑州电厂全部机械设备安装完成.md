Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 13th: The mechanical equipment of the newly built state-owned Zhengzhou Power Plant has been completely installed. The final installation, the No. 3 boiler, was successfully test-run on the morning of January 5th. The power generation capacity of the state-owned Zhengzhou Power Plant is three times the original power generation capacity of Zhengzhou City. Its completion provides power conditions for the further development of various industries in Zhengzhou City, especially the emerging cotton textile industry and light industry. The original power supply in Zhengzhou City was too small. After the expansion projects of some factories in Zhengzhou were put into production in the fourth quarter of last year, the industrial electricity consumption had exceeded the original maximum load capacity by more than 10%. At that time, the newly added electricity consumption had a source only because some equipment installed in the newly built Zhengzhou Power Plant began to transmit electricity. Now that all the mechanical equipment of the Zhengzhou Power Plant has been installed, it further guarantees that the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, the state-owned Zhengzhou Vegetable Oil Factory, and the state-owned Zhengzhou Flour Factory, which are under construction or will soon be built, can also obtain the necessary power supply.

The complete set of equipment installed in the Zhengzhou Power Plant is the latest type of automated equipment supplied to our country by the Soviet Union. The installation work has also received significant assistance from Soviet experts. Soviet experts provided specific guidance from the determination of the entire installation plan to the processing of small parts. During the installation process, a total of eighteen Soviet experts put forward more than three thousand valuable suggestions, and several experts also specifically gave "technical lectures" to workers and technicians. In this way, the entire project's planning management, technical management, and workers' operating skills have been armed with advanced Soviet experience, and the project has been done quickly and well. The entire installation project started on April 26th last year and took only eight months and nine days to complete. This progress is three to four times faster than the installation of projects with the same power generation capacity before the liberation of our country. Moreover, the water pressure capacity of the heating surface of the three boilers in the entire plant and the vibration amplitude of the bearings of the two turbines during operation have reached the best Soviet standards. More than one hundred auxiliary rotating machines in each workshop have also been qualified after acceptance.

### 新建国营郑州电厂全部机械设备安装完成

    新建国营郑州电厂全部机械设备安装完成
   【新华社郑州十三日电】新建国营郑州电厂的机械设备已全部安装好了。最后安装的第三号锅炉，在一月五日上午已试运转成功。国营郑州电厂的发电能力等于郑州市原有发电能力的三倍，它的建成给郑州市各项工业，特别是新兴棉纺工业和轻工业的进一步发展，提供了动力条件。郑州市原有电力太少，在去年第四季度郑州部分工厂的扩建工程投入生产后，工业用电量已经超过原有电力最高负荷能力的百分之十以上。当时由于新建郑州电厂安装起来部分设备开始送电，这批新增加的用电量才有了来源。现在郑州电厂全部机械设备安装完成，更保证了正在建设和即将兴工建设的国营郑州第一棉纺织厂、国营郑州第三棉纺织厂、国营郑州植物油厂、国营郑州面粉厂等厂也都能得到必需的动力供应。
    郑州电厂安装的全套设备都是苏联供应我国的最新式的自动化设备。安装工作也得到了苏联专家的重大帮助。苏联专家从整个安装计划的确定到细小零件的加工都作了具体指导。在安装过程中，先后有十八位苏联专家共提出了三千多条宝贵的建议，好几位专家并专门给工人和技术人员开讲了“技术讲座”。这样，整个工程的计划管理、技术管理和工人的操作技术，都有了苏联先进经验的武装，工程做得又快又好。整个安装工程从去年四月二十六日开始到全部安装好，只用了八个月零九天多的时间。这样的进度，比我国解放前安装同样发电能力的工程要快三、四倍。而且，全厂三部锅炉加热面承受水压能力之大，两部汽轮机运转时轴承震幅之小，都达到了苏联最优等的标准。各车间一百多台附属转动机械经过验收后，也都合格。
