Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party committees at all levels, Guizhou is carrying out the work of publicizing the general line of the nation to more than three million minority compatriots scattered across seventy-two counties. Weining, Tianzhu, Dading and other places first organized minority cadres to study the general line, and then relied on them to publicize it to the masses in their own languages. When more than 1,200 Dong and Miao cadres in Tianzhu County studied the general line together with Han cadres, the leadership used typical investigation materials and comparison methods to help these cadres calculate several detailed accounts: for example, the price of industrial products has decreased by 65% compared with before liberation, and the price of handicraft products has decreased by 43%. These two items alone saved 28,400 jin of grain for ten households of farmers, accounting for 49% of their total income. They said, "If the country did not develop industry, where would we have the good life we have today!" Five hundred and sixty cadres immediately volunteered to sell 54,000 jin of surplus grain to support the country's economic construction. Liping, Danzhai, Lushan, Leishan and other places, according to the customs of various ethnic groups, educated farmers about the role of socialist industrialization in improving the production and lives of ethnic minorities through leading figures who have connections with their own people, and through various festival gatherings, from a series of facts such as the state lending grain and loans to ethnic minorities, distributing winter clothes, and providing agricultural implements free of charge. In Fang Sheng Township, Danzhai County, a Miao Autonomous Region, 201 Miao families never grew wheat in the past, but last spring they harvested an additional 56,000 jin of wheat alone. Mass leader Zhang Shifa said: "Without the help of the government, where would the Miao people's harvest come from!" Miao woman Nie Shilian talked about how in the past, children cried because they could not get salt to eat, so she had to give them a piece of white stone to lick. She said: "The bitter days are over, and a good future depends on everyone's construction!" Under their vivid publicity, the masses have eagerly sold their surplus grain to the state, with Baini Township alone selling 148,000 jin. Lu Dianhua, a Buyi farmer from Zhuzizhai Village in Duyun County, was stopped by a profiteer on his way to sell grain to the state. Lu took out his commune member card and said to him: "I won't sell it to you, no matter how much money you offer!"

    贵州省少数民族农民纷纷把余粮卖给国家
    贵州各地在中共各级党委领导下，正向散布在七十二个县内的三百多万少数民族同胞，展开国家总路线的宣传工作。威宁、天柱、大定等地首先组织少数民族干部进行总路线学习，然后再依靠他们用本民族语言向群众宣传。天柱县一千二百多个侗族、苗族干部与汉族干部一起学习总路线时，领导方面运用典型调查材料，用回忆对比方法，帮助这些干部算了几笔细账：如工业品价格比解放前降低了百分之六十五，手工业品价格降低了百分之四十三，仅这两项即为十户农民节省谷子两万八千四百斤，占其总收入的百分之四十九。他们说：“如果不是国家发展工业，哪有今天的好日子！”五百六十个干部当即自愿卖出余粮五万四千斤，支援祖国的经济建设。黎平、丹寨、炉山、雷山等地根据各民族风俗习惯，通过与本族人民有联系的领袖人物，利用各种节日集会，从国家给少数民族贷粮、贷款、发放寒衣及无偿农具的一系列事实中，教育农民认识社会主义工业化对提高少数民族生产、生活的作用。丹寨县苗族自治区芳胜乡二零一户苗家，过去从不种小麦，去春单小麦就多收五万六千斤。群众领袖张世发说：“离了政府的帮助，哪有苗家的丰收啊！”苗族妇女聂世莲谈到过去孩子哭闹着吃不到盐巴，自己只好拿块白石头哄他舐舐。她说：“苦日子过去了，好光景要靠众人来建设！”群众在他们的生动宣传下，纷纷把余粮卖给国家，仅摆坭乡就卖了十四万八千斤。都匀县朱紫寨布依族农民陆殿华挑粮卖给国家，半路被奸商拦住，陆掏出社员证对他说：“再多钱也不卖给你！”
