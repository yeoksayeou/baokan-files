Public-Private Joint Shanghai Steel Company No. 1 Plant:
	Expanded and Rebuilt Some Equipment Last Year, Increasing Steel Production by More Than 10,000 Tons
	Last year, the Public-Private Joint Shanghai Steel Company No. 1 Plant expanded and rebuilt the weak parts of its old equipment. The investment was small, but the results were quick. Over the past year, this plant has produced over 10,000 tons more steel for the country and saved a large amount of raw materials.
	Last year, the plant expanded the converter workshop by building a cupola furnace, a crane, and other necessary equipment, increasing the supply of molten iron. This initially changed the situation where the cupola furnace production lagged behind the converter production. In half a year, it produced approximately 6,800 tons more steel for the country. After the plant changed the large-diameter, short-body Anglo-American converters to small-diameter, long-body Soviet-style converters, it reduced the blowing loss rate. In the second half of the year, it produced more than 2,500 tons of steel for the country. In early February last year, the open-hearth furnace workshop installed water tanks and other cooling equipment inside the silica bricks of the gas injector, strengthening the heat resistance of the gas injector silica bricks and ensuring the integrity of the gas port shape. This effectively extended the furnace life and reduced the number of medium repairs. For example, the furnace life of No. 1 open-hearth furnace after the medium repair was extended from a maximum of 80-plus heats in the previous year to a maximum of 338 heats last year. Last year, due to the reduction in the number of medium repairs, the country saved furnace bricks worth more than 10 billion yuan and produced more than 2,700 tons of steel. After installing a blower for air supply in the open-hearth furnace workshop, the air volume was sufficient, the gas combustion was uniform, and the smelting time for each heat of steel was shortened by 20 minutes compared to the past.
	Last year, the plant carried out a series of expansions and reconstructions on the weak parts of the old equipment, with a total investment of more than 7 billion yuan. However, calculated only from the item of reducing the blowing loss rate and producing more than 2,500 tons of steel in half a year after the above-mentioned equipment was rebuilt, the income exceeded this investment.

    去年扩充和改建部分设备增产一万多吨钢
    公私合营上海钢铁公司第一厂，去年在旧设备的薄弱部分进行了扩充和改建，投资不多，见效很快。一年来这个厂为国家多生产了上万吨钢和节省了大批原材料。
    去年该厂在转炉车间扩建了一座化铁炉、一台行车等必要设备，增加了铁水的供应，初步改变了化铁炉生产落后于转炉生产的情况，半年中，大约为国家多生产了六千八百多吨钢。该厂把口径大、炉体短的英美式转炉改换成口径小、炉体长的苏联式转炉后，降低了吹损率，下半年就为国家多炼出二千五百多吨钢。平炉车间去年二月初在煤气喷出口矽砖内安装了水箱等冷却设备，加强了煤气喷出口矽砖的抗热能力，保证了煤气口形态的完整，因而有效地延长了炉龄，减少了中修次数。如一号平炉中修后的炉龄，从前年最多炼八十多炉延长到去年最多炼三百三十八炉。去年一年，由于中修次数减少，约为国家节省价值一百多亿元的炉砖和多生产二千七百多吨钢。平炉车间在加装鼓风机送风后，风量充足，煤气燃烧均匀，每炉钢的冶炼时间也比过去缩短了二十分钟。
    该厂去年在旧设备的薄弱部分进行一系列的扩充和改建，共投资七十多亿元。但上述设备经过改建后，仅以半年内降低吹损率，多生产二千五百多吨钢一项收入计算，就超过了这笔投资。　　　（新华社）
