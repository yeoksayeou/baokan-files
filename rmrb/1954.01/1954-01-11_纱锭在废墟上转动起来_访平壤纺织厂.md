    Spindles Spinning Again on the Ruins
    —A Visit to the Pyongyang Textile Factory
    Jin Feng

    In early November 1953, on a cold morning, we arrived at the reconstruction site of the Pyongyang Textile Factory, the largest textile factory in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The factory had only been moved here from a mountain cave half a month prior, yet the walls of the huge factory buildings were already standing, and the towering chimney was already emitting thick smoke. The roofless factory building, with its newly installed doors and windows, exuded the fragrance of fresh wood, and the cement walls were not yet dry. The ground was littered with wood, cement, heating pipes, and bundles of raw cotton, as well as crates of machinery. People's Army soldiers were still building the roof and nailing planks, but a portion of the newly installed spindles were already spinning rapidly.
    “These machines have been producing continuously in the mountain caves, enduring many bombings, and some were assembled from scraps picked up in the ruins,” Kim Dae-bok, the factory’s Labor Party Committee Chairman, told us with a smile. “Even the machines are heroes,” we said, smiling as we touched the machines.
    “It’s not the machines, it’s the people. They are the real heroes,” Kim Dae-bok said seriously, pointing to several female workers in front of us.
    At that moment, three female workers standing before us—Go Young-sook, Kim Bok-sil, and Ju Bo-ok—along with Park Si-bok, the chairman of the factory’s trade union, began to tell us about the factory's situation.
    During the most difficult period of the war, most of the male workers had gone to the front lines, and the women had persisted in production. There was not enough time to evacuate the machines, so they had to be buried. Ju Bo-ok recalled the scene at the time, saying sadly, "At that time, it felt like we were burying our own relatives, not machines." But her tone quickly became firm, and she opened her dark eyes wide and said, "But every worker had the confidence that we would definitely return soon, and the spindles would spin again."
    Sure enough, they soon returned to Pyongyang with the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. At this time, the factory was a pile of ruins, and the heavy task of digging mountain caves and moving machines was undertaken by these female workers. Soon, production resumed in the mountain caves. But how great were the difficulties! The caves were low, so the workers couldn't straighten their backs; the ground was uneven, so they had to be careful not to trip when joining the yarn; the temperature and humidity couldn't be kept normal, and the power supply was frequently interrupted. In particular, the great flood of July 1951 and the major bombing of January 1953 caused production to be suspended twice. However, the workers overcame the floods, overcame the bombings, overcame all difficulties, rescued more than 20,000 spools of yarn from the floodwaters, erected the bombed-down machines in the mountain caves, and supplied the front lines with military uniforms continuously. Advanced workers constantly emerged. In the summer of 1952, the Hao Jianxiu Work Method spread to Korea. Kim Bok-sil, who was the same age as Hao Jianxiu, first studied it with her group. Usually, most workers in the mountain caves tended one to two hundred spindles, but after studying the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, Kim Bok-sil tended four hundred spindles, completed the 1952 national plan forty days ahead of schedule, and was awarded the Third Class National Flag Medal. In 1953, she completed the annual plan 102 days ahead of schedule. In 1952, Go Young-sook tended eight looms alone, completed more than 100,000 meters of cloth by the end of the year, and was awarded the title of "Republic Hero" and two First Class National Flag Medals.
    "The Party and the Leader cared for the factory, helping us through the most difficult period," Comrade Park Si-bok recalled the scene of Premier Kim Il-sung's visit to the factory last January. It was the day after the major bombing, the machines were damaged, the workers' belongings were all destroyed, and the factory was in a difficult period again. On this day, Premier Kim Il-sung came, he personally entered the mountain caves, learned about the damage to the machines, and comforted the workers guarding the machines. The next day, the urgently needed cotton clothes and shoes for the workers were distributed. Every worker felt a great warmth and encouragement, so they repaired the machines day and night, and fully resumed work on the fourth day.
    The day after the armistice, July 28th, Premier Kim Il-sung came to the factory again. He encouraged all the workers, saying: You have overcome all difficulties in the mountain caves and persisted in production. The motherland and the people will not forget your contributions. Now that the armistice we have been longing for has been achieved, we should quickly restore and rebuild our factory.
    The Leader's words ignited the workers' enthusiasm for labor like fire. The first task was to move the machines from the mountain caves back to the original factory site. According to the regulations, they were supposed to start work at eight o'clock in the morning, but many workers rushed to the mountain caves just after midnight to start dismantling and transporting. Some male workers were responsible for installing the machines, and the heavy transportation task fell on the shoulders of the female workers again. Every four of them carried 300 kilograms, 360 kilograms, or even 400 kilograms, from the mountain caves to the factory, a distance of three kilometers, transporting five or six trips a day. Their shoulders were swollen and bleeding, but no one said they were tired or cried out in pain. "At that time, I really felt that human power was infinite, and the more we carried, the more we could carry," Ju Bo-ok said with a hearty laugh.
    The original time scheduled by the Ministry of Light Industry for the relocation of this factory was forty-five days. After research, the factory decided to shorten it to twenty days, and as a result, it was all completed in only twelve days.
     "Since the start of work at the end of October, production has increased by 12 percent compared to before the armistice," the chairman of the trade union said with a smile, ending the conversation.
      A month later, we came to the Pyongyang Textile Factory again. We were even more surprised: the open-air, messy workshop was gone, and in front of us stood a brand-new, beautiful factory building; piles of machines and scattered wood were gone, and what we saw were shiny gray new steel frames and silver heating pipes spraying warm air. The eighteen carding machines had increased to sixty-eight, and the three thousand two hundred spindles had increased to thirteen thousand two hundred. The female workers were all wearing new gray work clothes and white headscarves, busily working beside the machines.
      "But how could these factory buildings be built so quickly?" we asked in surprise.
      "Relying on the three thousand pairs of working hands of our two thousand People's Army soldiers and one thousand workers," the construction engineer Shen Yong-hoon answered word by word, with a proud look on his face. Then he recounted the process of restoration:
   "At the beginning, there was almost nothing, no materials, no tools, no skilled workers. So the People's Army soldiers and workers collected four million bricks and tiles, more than fifty tons of steel bars, and one hundred thousand meters of electric wire, and twenty-five thousand meters of heating pipes from the ruins. The Ministry of Light Industry transferred
   one hundred technical workers, and everyone followed them, learning while doing. Now, we have trained 725 technicians.” He became more and more excited: “Later, the situation got even better, with materials coming in an endless stream from China and the Soviet Union. These days, forty to fifty train cars are unloaded every day. Before June of next year, six thousand train cars of materials will be transported here. In this way, our construction speed will be even faster. By June 1955, we will have completed all the buildings for 60,000 spindles, 2,500 looms, and the housing, cultural palace, workers' school, and warehouses for 13,000 workers."
     Walking out of the factory building, the chairman of the trade union pointed to the towering steel frame and the surrounding ruins and said happily: "This is where the 60,000 spindles will spin. At that time, an annual output of 60 to 70 million meters of cloth will be able to initially meet the needs of the people of the Republic." (Attached picture)

    纱锭在废墟上转动起来
    ——访平壤纺织厂
    金凤
    一九五三年十一月初，一个寒冷的早晨，我们来到了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最大的纺织厂——平壤纺织厂重建中的工地。这个工厂从山洞中搬到这里才仅仅半个月，而巨大厂房的墙壁已经竖立起来，高耸的烟囱已经吐着浓烟了。这个无顶的厂房，新安上的门窗发散着新鲜木材的香味，水泥墙壁也还没有干透。地上到处是木材、水泥、暖汽管和一包包的原棉、一箱箱的机器。人民军战士还在盖着屋顶，钉着木板，可是刚刚安装好的一部分纱锭，已经在飞快地转动了。
    “这些机器是一直在山洞中坚持生产的，挨过不少次炸，有些是在废墟中一点点拣起来装配上的。”工厂劳动党委员长金大福微笑着告诉我们。“连机器也是英雄。”我们抚摸着机器笑着说。
    “不是机器，是人。就是她们才是真正的英雄。”金大福严肃地说着，指着面前的几个女工。
    这时站在我们面前的三个女工：高英淑、金福实和朱宝玉，还有工厂职工同盟委员长朴时福同志就和我们谈起了工厂的情况。
    那是战争最困难的时期，男工绝大部分都上前线去了，妇女们坚持着生产，机器撤退来不及，只得掩埋起来。朱宝玉回忆着当时的情景，还难过地说：“那时候，仿佛埋的不是机器，倒像在埋葬自己的亲人。”但她的语调很快就变得坚强起来，她睁圆了她那双乌黑的眼睛说：“可是每个工人都有信心，不久我们一定回来，纱锭一定会转动起来。”
    果然，不久她们随着志愿军和人民军，回到平壤来了。这时，工厂成了一片废墟，挖山洞、搬机器的重担，都由她们这些女工担当起来了。很快，生产在山洞中恢复了。但是，困难是多大啊！山洞矮，工人腰都直不起，地面不平，接纱头都要留心绊倒，温度和湿度不能保持正常，电力供应也时时中断。尤其是一九五一年七月的大洪水和一九五三年一月的大轰炸，使生产两度停顿。但是，工人们战胜了洪水，战胜了轰炸，战胜了一切困难，两万多个线团从洪水中抢救出来了，被炸倒的机器又在山洞中竖立起来，军衣源源地供应着前方，工人中还不断涌现出先进的劳动者。一九五二年夏天，郝建秀工作法传到朝鲜。和郝建秀同岁的金福实首先和她的小组研究起来。平常，一般工人在山洞中生产，大抵一人看一百到两百纱锭，可是金福实在学习了郝建秀工作法以后，一个人看到四百纱锭，提前四十天完成一九五二年的国家计划，获得了“三级国旗勋章”。一九五三年又提前一百零二天完成了全年计划。一九五二年高英淑一人看八台织布机，年底完成十万公尺以上的布，获得“共和国英雄”称号和两枚“一级国旗勋章”。
    “党和领袖对工厂的关怀，帮助我们度过最困难的时期。”朴时福同志回忆起了金日成首相去年一月来工厂的情景。那是大轰炸后的第二天，机器被破坏了，工人的东西全部被毁灭了，工厂又处在困难的时期，就在这一天，金日成首相来了，他亲自进入山洞，了解机器被破坏的情况，慰问守卫着机器的工人。第二天，工人急需的棉衣鞋子就发下来了。每个工人都感到一种极大的温暖和鼓舞，于是不分日夜抢修机器，第四天又全面复工了。
    停战以后的第二天，七月二十八日，金日成首相又来到了工厂，他慰勉全体工人说：你们在山洞中克服一切困难，坚持了生产，祖国和人民是不会忘记你们的功绩的。现在，我们渴望的停战已经实现了，应该很快恢复和重建我们的工厂。
    领袖的话像火一样点燃着工人们的劳动热情。首先就要把机器从山洞中搬回到原来的厂址上。按规定是早上八点钟上班，但很多工人午夜刚过就赶到山洞中开始拆卸搬运了。部分男工负责安装机器，沉重的搬运任务又落到女工肩上。她们每四个人扛三百公斤、三百六十公斤，甚至四百公斤，从山洞到工厂有三公里远，一天搬运五六趟。肩膀压肿了，流出血来，没有人说累，也没有人喊疼。“那时，真感觉人的力量是无限的，愈扛愈能扛。”朱宝玉说着爽朗地笑起来。
    轻工业省原定的迁移这个工厂的时间是四十五天，工厂研究后决定缩短到二十天完成，结果只有十二天的时间就全部完成了。
      “十月底开工到现在，生产已经比停战前提高百分之十二。”职工同盟委员长微笑着结束了这场谈话。
      一个月以后，我们又来到平壤纺织厂。我们更惊异了：露天的凌乱的车间不见了，在我们面前矗立着的是一座崭新美丽的厂房；一堆堆的机器和散乱的木材不见了，看到的是灰色闪光的新钢架，喷着暖流的银色暖汽管。十八台梳棉机增加到了六十八台，三千二百个纱锭已增加到一万三千二百个了。女工们一律穿着灰色的新工作服，扎着白色的头巾，在机器旁边忙碌着。
      “可是，这些厂房怎么这样快就建设得起来呢？”我们惊讶地问。
      “依靠我们两千人民军和一千工人的三千双劳动者的手。”建筑工程师申永勋一字一句地回答，脸上显出自豪的神情。接着他又叙述起恢复的过程：
  “一开始，几乎什么也没有，没有材料，没有工具，没有熟练工人。于是人民军战士和工人就在废墟上收集了四百万块砖瓦，五十多吨钢筋和十万公尺长的电线，二万五千公尺长的暖气管。轻工业省调来
  一百名技术工人，大家就跟着他们一边做一边学，现在已经培养出七百二十五名技工。”他越说越兴奋：“以后情况就更好了，从中国，从苏联源源不绝地送来材料，这几天每天要卸四、五十车厢。明年六月以前，要运六千车厢的材料来。这样，我们建设的速度就更快了。到一九五五年六月，我们就要完成六万纱锭、二千五百台织布机和一万三千工人的住宅、文化宫、职工学校和仓库的全部建筑。”
    走出厂房，职工同盟委员长指着那兀立的钢架，指着周围的废墟愉快地说：“这就是六万纱锭转动起来的地方。那时候，年产六千万到七千万公尺的布，就可以初步满足共和国人民的需要了。”（附图片）
