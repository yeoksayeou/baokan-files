Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 20th: The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the political conference issue issued the following communique:

    On January 20th, the fourth meeting of the Liaison Secretaries of both sides was held. At today's meeting, the U.S. side continued to insist on revising the meeting minutes as a condition for resuming bilateral talks, and refused to consider the resumption date proposed by our side once again, resulting in another fruitless meeting.

    At today's meeting, our secretary repeatedly explained our firm position of advocating immediate and unconditional resumption of the talks, and once again suggested resuming the bilateral talks on January 23rd. Our secretary pointed out: Our side has twice suggested dates for resumption, but the other side has raised irrelevant issues and put forward so-called conditions for resumption to delay the resumption of bilateral talks. In the past three meetings, the other side even completely refused to agree with our side on a date for resumption. The other side is delaying within the meeting, while spreading an atmosphere of optimism outside the meeting, with the obvious purpose of forcing the detention of our captured personnel and avoiding the convening of the United Nations General Assembly. Facts have proven that the other side has already coerced the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to hand over our captured personnel to the other side, in order for the other side to realize its purpose of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

    The U.S. side continued to unreasonably insist on revising the meeting minutes, saying that this could provide a basis for resuming bilateral talks, and continued to insist on holding an administrative meeting to discuss the issue of revising the minutes.

    Our secretary immediately pointed out: Our side has repeatedly stated that there should be no conditions for resuming the meeting, and revising the meeting minutes to revive past disputes can only hinder the resumption of bilateral talks. Our secretary also emphasized once again: What our side said in past talks were all facts, so there is no need to revise them, and our side is not prepared to revise them. As for the other side's claim that it is necessary to find a basis for resuming bilateral talks, our side is willing to point out that it is precisely because the other side unilaterally interrupted the talks that the basis for the talks was undermined. The issue now is not to find a basis to resume the talks, but to resume the talks immediately. The two sides should conduct sincere consultations in the talks to arrange for the early convening of the political conference. The other side's repeated insistence on holding an administrative meeting is solely for the purpose of deceiving the people of the world, creating the impression that the meeting has made progress, in order to avoid the United Nations General Assembly. An administrative meeting can only be contemplated after the bilateral talks have resumed. The task of the Liaison Secretaries' Meeting between the two sides is only to resolve the simple issue of the resumption date, and there is absolutely no need to hold an administrative meeting for this. Finally, our secretary repeatedly stated that our side is willing to listen to the other side's opinions on our proposed date of January 23rd for the resumption of talks.

    However, the U.S. side insisted on its unreasonable demands and refused to consider the resumption date proposed by our side for the third time. The other side said it was not prepared to resume bilateral talks on January 23rd and proposed adjourning the meeting until January 21st. In order to give the other side more time to consider changing its position, our side proposed adjourning the meeting until January 23rd, which the U.S. side agreed to.

    双方联络秘书会议二十日会议又无结果
    美方继续坚持无理主张拖延恢复双方会谈
   【新华社开城二十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    一月二十日，双方联络秘书会议举行第四次会议。在今日会议上，美方仍然坚持修改会议记录作为恢复双方会谈的条件，而拒绝考虑我方又一次提出的复会日期，以致会议又无结果。
    我方秘书在今日会议上反复说明了我方坚决主张立即无条件复会的立场，并再一次建议于一月二十三日恢复双方会谈。我方秘书指出：我方曾两次建议复会的日期，但对方却横生枝节地提出所谓复会条件以拖延双方会谈的恢复。在过去三次会议上，对方甚至根本拒绝与我方商定复会日期。对方在会内拖延，在会外则散发乐观空气，目的显然是要达到强迫扣留我方被俘人员和避开联合国大会的召开。事实证明，对方已经胁迫了中立国遣返委员会把我方被俘人员交还对方，以便对方实现其强迫扣留战俘的目的。
    美方依然无理主张修改会议记录，说是这样可以为恢复双方会谈寻找一个基础，并继续坚持举行行政性会议，讨论修改记录问题。
    我方秘书当即指出：我方已一再说明复会不应有任何条件，修改会议记录恢复过去的争论只能阻碍双方会谈的恢复。我方秘书并且再一次强调指出：我方在过去会谈中所说的都是事实，因此无需修改，我方也不准备修改。至于对方所谓为了恢复双方会谈必须寻找一个基础，我方愿意指出：正是由于对方片面中断了会谈，才使会谈的基础遭受破坏。现在的问题不是寻找基础以恢复会谈，而是立即恢复会谈。在会谈中双方进行诚意协商，以安排政治会议的早日召开。对方一再坚持进行行政性会议，其目的完全是为了蒙蔽世界人民，造成会议已有进展的印象，借以躲过联合国大会。行政性会议只有在双方会谈恢复之后才是可以设想的，双方联络秘书会议其任务只是解决复会日期，这个简单问题绝无必要进行行政性会议。最后我方秘书又一再表示，我方愿意听取对方对我方所提一月二十三日为复会日期的意见。
    但美方坚持其无理主张，而拒绝考虑我方第三次提出的复会日期，对方说不准备一月二十三日恢复双方会谈，并提议休会至一月二十一日。我方为了使对方有更多的时间考虑改变其立场，乃提出休会至一月二十三日，美方同意。
