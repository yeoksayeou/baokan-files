    Shanghai's Eight Public and Private-Public Joint Theater Troupes Tour and Perform
    Since January of this year, six public theater troupes and two private-public joint theater troupes in Shanghai have been rotating performances in various districts in a planned and step-by-step manner, while also guiding and promoting local amateur cultural activities. They have performed a total of 721 shows, with an audience of over 750,000 people. Their repertoire includes Shanghai Opera "Luohan Qian," Jianghuai Opera "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," Pingtan "Must Repair the Huai River Well," "Special-Class Hero Huang Jiguang," "Sea Hero," Peking Opera "San Cha Kou," "General and Prime Minister," "Black Whirlwind Li Kui," acrobatics "Diabolo," "Ventriloquism," dance "Tea Picking Lantern," and drama "During the Days of the General Election," "In the Face of New Things," totaling 181 programs. Workers, farmers, and soldiers especially love the theater troupes that perform for them. For example, the Shanghai Touring Cultural Troupe, in coordination with the progress of Shanghai's general election movement, successively performed "During the Days of the General Election" in various factories, workers' clubs, and workers' cultural palaces. The performance of this program corrected the workers' attitude towards the general election and greatly encouraged their production enthusiasm. The Shanghai Opera "Luohan Qian" enabled the broad masses of farmers to have a clear understanding of the superiority of the new marriage system. The short, concise, lively, and vigorous Pingtan performances were even more loved by the soldiers, and many soldiers expressed that they would take the heroic figures in the Pingtan as role models. During the performance period, the theater troupes held many observation, get-together, and symposium meetings with workers, farmers, and soldiers in various places.

    Literary and Artistic Activities in State-Owned Factories in Shenyang
    In the past year, amateur literary and artistic activities in state-owned factories in Shenyang City have greatly developed, and the workers' creative and performing art levels have also improved to a certain extent. According to incomplete statistics from 85 factories in the city recently, there are already 51 amateur cultural troupes, with more than 2,900 members, and 232 various literary and artistic groups, including drama, music, dance, and folk art, with more than 3,000 people. The cultural troupes and literary and artistic groups frequently hold various performances, which are welcomed by the broad masses of the audience.
    In order to vigorously develop factory literary and artistic activities, Shenyang City frequently holds worker amateur literary and artistic observation meetings. At the 1953 Employee Amateur Literary and Artistic Observation Meeting, 83 programs, including drama, opera, Peking Opera, Ping Opera, crosstalk, kuaiban, and bengbeng, were performed. These programs demonstrated the new achievements of workers in creative and performing arts. The content of most of the programs is closely integrated with production and political movements; in terms of creative methods, they also grasped relatively typical events in workers' lives, and paid attention to the portrayal of characters and the use of language. In terms of performance, the actors have been able to basically express the unique styles of various dramas and the personalities of the characters in the play. The techniques of music and dance are also gradually improving.

    The "Qin and Han Dynasties Exhibition" at the Beijing Museum of History is Now Open
    The Qin and Han Dynasties Exhibition at the Beijing Museum of History opened on January 18th. This exhibition succinctly and vividly demonstrates the new developments in the economy, politics, and culture after the establishment of China's centralized autocratic system.
    This exhibition introduces some newly discovered materials from various places in basic construction, such as the five newly discovered grains in the Han tombs in Luoyang: rice, millet, sorghum, foxtail millet, and Job's tears; iron plows, iron shovels, iron sickles, and iron tools (axes, hammers, knives, scissors, etc.) unearthed from Doujitai, Baoji, Shaanxi. Lacquerware discovered in Changsha, silk fabrics discovered in Xinjiang, and yellow-green glazed pottery unearthed from the Han tomb in Doujitai all illustrate the new achievements of the working people in handicraft production at that time. The brilliant achievements of the Han Wudi era and the scientific achievements of the Han Dynasty in astronomy, geography (Zhang Heng's seismograph), mathematics (Liu Xin's ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter), and medicine (Zhang Zhongjing's Treatise on Febrile Diseases), as well as the invention of paper and porcelain, are also shown in the exhibition.
    The exhibition also displays rubbings of portrait stones newly discovered from the tomb of Wang Deyuan in Sui De County, Shaanxi Province (100 AD), the twelfth year of Yongyuan in the Eastern Han Dynasty, portrait bricks and painted bricks unearthed in Luoyang and Yanling, Henan, and gold ornaments, agate jade, and other precious items discovered in the tomb of Cao Zhi of the Three Kingdoms in Dong'e County, Shandong, as well as pottery burial objects in the tomb. Among them, the plowing portrait in the Yongyuan twelfth year stone carving is particularly noteworthy. It depicts the shape of the plow, the method of harnessing the ox, and the activities of people in a concrete and vivid way, which is a rare historical material.

      沈阳国营工厂的文艺活动
    沈阳市国营工厂一年来业余文艺活动有很大发展，工人的创作和表演艺术水平也有一定程度的提高。据最近市内八十五个工厂的不完全统计，已有五十一个业余文工团，二千九百多名团员和拥有三千多人的戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、曲艺等各种文艺小组二百三十二个。文工团和文艺小组经常举行各种演出，受到广大观众的欢迎。
