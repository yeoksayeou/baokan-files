Another Treasure Trove of the Motherland's Classical Art Heritage
——A Brief Account of the Survey of the Maijishan Grottoes
Wu Zuoren
Following the preliminary survey of the Bingling Temple Grottoes in Yongjing, Gansu in 1952, the Social and Cultural Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Culture conducted a survey of the Maijishan Grottoes in Tianshui, Gansu last July.

Maijishan is located in the southeast of Tianshui County, Gansu Province, 45 kilometers from the city. It is the western end of the Qinling Mountains, bordering the edge of the great forest. Starting from Tianshui City, after about 35 kilometers of relatively flat terrain through Mapaoquan and Ganquan Town, you enter the Maijishan Gorge. Following the mountain stream for another ten kilometers, you will see the towering Maiji Cliff. This strangely shaped mountain peak, when viewed from the west, has a slightly conical shape, with the upper end larger than the bottom, resembling a pile of wheat stalks stacked on a rural threshing ground. Farmers have long called it Maiji Cliff. About 1,500 years ago and in subsequent dynasties of feudal rule, millions of people were driven to carve large and small niches resembling beehives, layered vertically and horizontally, into the mountainside, and to build multi-storied pavilions, flying galleries, and sky bridges on the outer cliffs of the caves. In such a massive and magnificent creation, our ancestors – the ancient working people – demonstrated unparalleled courage and wisdom.

However, due to the loose and fragile stone of Maijishan, which is easily weathered, many niches have collapsed. The entire collection of more than 190 niches, spanning more than 210 meters east-west and more than 50 meters vertically, has suffered the most severe collapse in the middle, with some niches only retaining a corner on the broken cliff, and others leaving no trace at all, thus forming the East Cliff and West Cliff sections. It is said that as early as the Five Dynasties period, there was already a distinction between the "East Pavilion" and the "West Pavilion" [Note 1].

The survey team went to Maijishan and stayed at a temple very close to the grottoes – Ruiying Temple. From Ruiying Temple, it is about 500 meters to the large stone staircase of the East Cliff (numbered 168), from which you can climb to the Thousand Buddha Corridor (numbered 003), Sanhua Building and Seven Buddha Pavilion (numbered 004), and Niu'ertang (numbered 005).

Sanhua Building is at the top of the Seven Buddha Pavilion. The Seven Buddha Pavilion is a cliff pavilion with seven bays and eight large pillars, the largest in scale among all the grottoes. On a cliff more than 50 meters above the ground, stone is carved into eaves and columns, and behind the columns, stone is carved into a row of seven Buddha niches, with a long corridor formed between the niches and the large columns. The ceiling is in the form of a checkerboard pattern. From the remaining murals of chariots and horses on the top, it can be seen that it is a work of the Western Wei Dynasty (6th century AD). On the wall above the seven Buddha niches, there are also seven fairly complete murals, each depicting four celestial musicians, some playing musical instruments, some holding incense burners, and some scattering flowers. Judging from the style of this group of murals and the costumes of the patrons under the Buddha statues between every two murals, they should all belong to the Sui or early Tang Dynasty. The walls of the row of niches are fully decorated with curtains and reliefs of the Eight Devas. The height of the cliff pavilion from the ceiling to the corridor floor is 8.75 meters, the corridor is 31.5 meters long, and at each end of the corridor, there are Heavenly King statues more than 4.5 meters high. Above the Heavenly King statues, there are ear niches carved into the upper end of the stone wall, with statues inside. Including the statues in the seven Buddha niches, there are a total of seventy pieces, most of which are more than two meters high. These statues combine the styles of the Tang and Song Dynasties, and also have traces of Ming Dynasty repairs and repainting, indicating that the Seven Buddha Pavilion was built in the Northern Dynasties and then renovated in the Sui and Tang Dynasties. The statues were recast on the basis of the early Tang Dynasty, repaired in the Song Dynasty, and repainted in the Ming Dynasty. However, it is unknown in what era, perhaps during an earthquake, the front part of the rock-eaved pavilion of these eight large stone pillars collapsed, leaving only two pillars attached to the cliff stone at both ends.

The flying path from here to the adjacent Niu'ertang is also broken. It is possible that in the Southern Song Dynasty, the stone wall between Sanhua Building and Niu'ertang was pierced through, and in the Ming Dynasty it was widened to become a tunnel about 3.5 meters long and 1.2 meters high, allowing one person to walk through while bending over.

Niu'ertang is also a cliff pavilion, but the difference is that Niu'ertang only has three niches and three bays with four pillars. The structure of the stone eaves, columns, and ceilings is the same as Sanhua Building. There were originally four Heavenly King statues in the long corridor, but now only one Heavenly King statue stepping on a calf remains, which is the origin of the name "Niu'ertang". Most of the statues in each niche have been repaired in the Ming Dynasty, but the decorative pillars at the entrance of the niches and the unretouched murals outside the niches show the style of the Northern Wei Dynasty. The front eaves and columns of Niu'ertang have long collapsed, and the remaining stone-carved brackets can still be seen on the eaves.

In the lower part of the East Cliff, there is the No. 043 cliff pavilion, which also has three bays and four pillars, but the internal structure is different. The long corridor is 6.67 meters long, and the two Heavenly King statues at both ends are still there. There is only one niche in the middle, and the decoration on the upper part of the back wall of the central Buddha seat is a floating double-headed dragon chair back. Behind the chair, two dragon girls worship the Buddha and offer pearls, revealing their upper bodies. In the lower half of the back wall, near the ground, there is a dark and damp cave. It is said that this is the ancient Qiudong, and in the past, when farmers suffered from drought, they would come to this cliff pavilion to pray for rain. As for the statues in the pavilion, they have been decorated to varying degrees by later generations based on the statues of the early Tang Dynasty. There are two ear niches carved on the side walls of the niche, which still retain the murals of the Wei Dynasty, which shows that the construction age of this cliff pavilion is also very early. There are no brackets under the eaves here, but they are replaced by floating carved "flame jewels". This kind of stone-column cliff pavilion with the traditional architecture of the Han Dynasty only exists in seven places on the East Cliff.

The grotto complex on the West Cliff is just as the people of the Five Dynasties said: "...among them, there are thousands of rooms and houses, built in the air and stepping on emptiness, and those who climb it dare not look back...", which shows the large number of niches and the danger of climbing. So far, there are ninety caves accessible by plank roads here. From the ground to the highest point of the West Cliff, there are a total of twelve layers of niche frames (a vertical distance of 52.11 meters), all of which are built with aerial plank roads. On the eighth floor, the plank road splits into east and west lines.

The largest cave on the east line of the West Cliff, the "Stele Cave" (No. 133), has an internal height of 5.97 meters, a width of 14.91 meters, and a maximum depth of 11.58 meters. It is a cave with a complex and special architectural structure. The walls are covered with countless small "shadow sculptures" of the Wise Kalpa Thousand Buddhas. Some of the niche lintels are also decorated with small three-dimensional statues of patrons and floating sculptures of landscape backgrounds. Including works from the Western Wei and later periods, there are a total of thirty statues. The tallest is the standing statue of Amitabha receiving the souls (3.5 meters high) at the entrance, which is a large statue repaired in the Song Dynasty but still retains the style of Tang sculptures. The artistic skill is very high, especially the two hands, which vividly express a keen sense of touch. The top of this cave is an irregular polygonal shape with convex and concave shapes, just like the floor plan. In the upper left part of the ceiling, there is a flat ceiling, which is covered with flying Apsaras. However, the rock is severely weathered, and most of the paintings have peeled off and blurred. In the right outer top, there is a caisson ceiling, which is a peculiar structure. The front wall of the cave is seeping water, so it is very humid, which not only seriously erodes the ceiling murals, but also blurs the faces of the stone sculptures. However, this cave still preserves quite a few statue steles. Among the eighteen complete ones, the one depicting the "Biography of the Buddha" is the most varied and vivid. Because there are the most Buddha statues in this cave, it has long been called "Ten Thousand Buddha Hall". Also, because there are many statue steles in the cave, we call it "Stele Cave".

Walking further up to the top of the east line plank road is Cave No. 135, which is the highest point of the West Cliff and is called "Paradise Cave". This Paradise Cave is a simple rectangular cave, 5 meters high, 8.88 meters wide, and 4.29 meters deep. The walls are painted with scenes of ancient cavalry battles, most of which have peeled off and faded. Three window holes are cut through the upper end of the cave door. Such a cave structure is rare. The niches carved into the three walls contain statues from the Northern Wei Dynasty, which were recast in the Song Dynasty. In the middle of the cave stands a stone statue 1.95 meters high, and two stone statues 1.28 meters high on its left and right. The stone material used for these large Wei Dynasty stone-carved style statues is a relatively solid, hard sandstone with a grayish-red color, which is not quarried from this mountain. We were very surprised and could not imagine how, at that time (1,500 years ago), purely with human physical strength, large stones weighing three or four tons could be lifted from the ground and moved to a cave more than 50 meters high.

Walking along the west line plank road on the West Cliff to the highest level and entering Cave No. 127, it is the smallest of the three major caves on the West Cliff. It is 4.42 meters high, 8.63 meters wide, and 4.85 meters deep. The most exquisite and vivid statues are the stone carvings of the Western Wei Dynasty in a niche on the front wall. The caisson ceiling and the entire four walls are covered with paintings. Although there is peeling and fading, they are more complete than other caves.

The Bodhisattva and patron statues recast in the Song Dynasty in Cave No. 165 on the West Cliff should be considered outstanding works of Song sculpture. From the development of early statues to this period, it is very clear that there is a gradual development from the divine and ideal to the human and realistic. The broken backlight decorations on the back wall of the sculpture, the colors and patterns, and the traces of the original sculpted ribbons left on the wall all indicate that this cave was built in the early Northern Wei Dynasty.

Precisely because the stone quality of this mountain cliff is a kind of conglomerate, which is not suitable for stone carving, most of the statues in Maijishan are sculptures. Thousands of statues (not including countless small shadow sculptures), such as the large cliff Buddha statue No. 013 on the East Cliff, which is 15.28 meters high, and the large cliff Buddha statue No. 098 on the West Cliff, which is 13.88 meters high, and many statues that are only more than 20 centimeters high, are all sculptures. Bringing together the outstanding creations of the nation from the past one thousand three to four hundred years, such a treasure is rare in the world! However, the Maijishan Grottoes have repeatedly suffered misfortunes; originally, "every niche has a Buddha, and every wall has flying Apsaras", but many of the existing statues have broken necks and arms, and the murals have been damaged too severely. Due to various causes of destruction, such as rock collapse, humid climate, swallows nesting, squirrels digging holes, wasps drilling holes, and the smoke and scorching from people living there to avoid war, and even fires, theft, and the inscriptions and graffiti of tourists over the ages, these natural and man-made destructions have caused countless losses to the precious grotto art, and some caves have been destroyed to the point of nothing left (such as Cave No. 034 on the East Cliff, and Cave No. 063, No. 066, No. 052, and No. 153 on the West Cliff).

Through these surviving treasures, we can still see the brilliant achievements of the ancient people in modeling art. In their creations, they reflected the images of people's lives at that time. These works are full of fresh, lively, and dynamic beauty. They truly inherited the excellent artistic traditions of the Han and Jin Dynasties, enlightened the further realistic path of the Tang and Song Dynasties, and unfolded a brilliant chapter in the history of Chinese art.

We do not have clear historical records about the grottoes and can only find scattered materials in the records. We know that as early as the Han and Jin Dynasties (3rd century BC to 3rd century AD), Maijishan was constantly mentioned in history. During the period of warring states in the Sixteen Kingdoms (4th century AD), it was even more of a key strategic point of the separatist dynasties. Without confirming the beginning of the construction age of the grottoes, we know that by the end of the 4th century and the beginning of the 5th century AD, Maiji Cliff was already a prosperous Buddhist center (see the biography of Xuan Gao in the Biographies of Eminent Monks of Liang). The inscription "Jingming three years..." (502 AD) written in ink on the statue base we discovered in Cave No. 115 is just one of the many early grottoes with a year number that can be checked by chance, and it is certainly not necessarily the earliest one carved. Although the "Stele of Sha弥 Fasheng Creating a Niche in Luoyang" and the inscription of Li Yunxin of the Northern Zhou Dynasty creating the Seven Buddha Niches that we discovered this time are confirmed by the steles, we cannot be sure which niche they refer to.

Based on various records, we can find out the pattern of the rise and fall of the grottoes. Each large-scale renovation and revival mainly occurred at the beginning of a prosperous age of a feudal dynasty and after an earthquake or turmoil. Statistics show that from the beginning of the 6th century to the 18th century, there were eight series of large and small earthquakes at intervals. From the reconstruction of the cliff pavilion by Emperor Wen of the Western Wei Dynasty to the reconstruction of Ruiying Temple in the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, there were countless repairs in between. During the reign of Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty, the statues were rebuilt on a larger scale. The early Tang and Song Dynasties left outstanding works. There were four earthquakes in the Yuan Dynasty, but no representative works of the Yuan Dynasty have been found here. The repainting in the Ming and Qing Dynasties has clear inscriptions left on the walls. After so many damages and repairs, the cliff walls have been carved and decorated one after another, and the murals have several layers of repainting. Often, some caves were built in the Wei Dynasty, and the paintings were repainted in the Ming Dynasty; some have Wei Dynasty murals and Song Dynasty statues. Some of the later large cliff Buddha statues are pressing down on early ruined murals. Such a complex situation requires further research by experts.

In the years of past reactionary rule, it was commonplace for ancient cultural relics to be discarded, trampled upon, and continuously stolen by imperialists. The shocking and painful losses were truly incalculable. But today, a new China has stood up. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government have China's ancient artistic heritage been respected and cherished, and have people been universally educated to value their national culture. This is the artistic wealth created and left behind by our ancestors, and it has now returned to the hands of the people. People and cadres in all regions should earnestly implement the relevant decrees of the Central Government and conscientiously take responsibility for protecting these heritages. In order to develop the new art of the people, we must absorb the essence of the excellent ancient national art heritage.

    祖国古典艺术遗产的又一宝库
    ——麦积山石窟勘察纪略
  　吴作人
    中央文化部社会文化事业管理局继一九五二年在甘肃永靖炳灵寺石窟初步调查之后，去年七月又进行了甘肃天水麦积山石窟勘察工作。
    麦积山在甘肃省天水县的东南，距城四十五公里，是秦岭山脉的西端，紧接着大森林的边缘。从天水城出发，经过马跑泉、甘泉镇约三十五公里比较平坦的地带，就进入麦积山硖口。缘山溪再走十公里的山路就看到了危峰耸立的麦积崖。这个形象奇特的山峰，从西面看过去，山头略带圆锥形，上端比底部大，正像农村场子上堆积的麦秸。农民们从很早就叫它做麦积崖。大约在一千五百年前及其以后的历代封建统治王朝，驱策千万的百姓，在山腰里修凿了上下分层横列的蜂房似的大小龛窟，又在窟外悬壁上建筑起重楼复殿、飞阁天桥。就在这样一个巨大的辉煌的创造里，我们的祖先——古代劳动人民，表现了绝顶的勇敢和智慧。
    可是由于麦积山的石质松碎，容易风化，许多龛窟都已经崩塌了。全部一百九十多个龛窟，共占东西二百十多公尺、上下五十多公尺，其崩塌的情况尤以中部为最严重，有些龛窟只残剩一角留在断崖上，有些则连痕迹都不见了，因此就形成了东崖和西崖两部。据说远在五代以前，就已经有“东阁”、“西阁”之分了〔注一〕。
    考察团上了麦积山，就在离石窟很近的一个寺院——瑞应寺住下。从瑞应寺走约五百公尺就到东崖的大石梯（编号一六八），由此可登千佛廊（编号○○三）、散花楼和七佛阁（编号○○四）以及牛儿堂（编号○○五）。
    散花楼在七佛阁顶的上端。七佛阁是七间八大柱的崖阁，是全部石窟中规模最大的一个。在离地面五十多公尺的悬岩上，凿石成屋檐列柱，柱后又凿石成一列七个佛龛，龛和大柱间组成长廊。天花板是平棋式。从顶间残剩壁画的车马服饰来看，当是西魏（公元六世纪）的作品。七个佛龛的上端壁间，又画着相当完整的七大幅壁画，每幅画着四个伎乐天人，有的在鸣奏乐器，有的捧炉进香，有的手散天花。这一组的壁画，按其风格和每两幅壁画之间的佛像下供养人的服饰判断，应该是同属隋或初唐的作品。列龛的壁面上满饰幔帐和天龙八部浮雕。崖阁从天花板到长廊地面，是八点七五公尺，廊长三一点五公尺，廊的两端壁前各立高达四公尺半以上的天王塑像。天王塑像之上，石壁上端各辟耳龛，里面又有塑像。连同七个佛龛里的造像，总计有七十件，高度绝大多数都在两公尺以上。这些塑像兼有唐、宋的风格，而又有明代修补和妆彩的痕迹，可见七佛阁从北朝修建之后，曾经隋唐增修，造像是在初唐重塑的基础上，宋代加以修补，明代又修妆过的。但是不知在什么年代，也许在某一次地震时，这八大石柱的石檐崖阁的前部崩塌了，现在只剩两端附着在崖石上的两柱。
    从这儿到紧接着的牛儿堂去的飞栈也断了。可能在南宋时期，把散花楼和牛儿堂之间的石壁凿通，而明代又加放宽，成为长三点五公尺，高一点二公尺左右能容一人弯身而行的隧道。
    牛儿堂也是崖阁，不同的是牛儿堂仅有三龛，三间四柱。至于石檐、列柱、天花板等结构和散花楼一样。长廊原有四尊天王像，现在仅存中左的一尊脚踏牛儿的天王，这就是“牛儿堂”名称的来源。各龛内的造像大部都经明代修过了，但是龛口的装饰柱和龛外未经涂改的壁画，都看得出是北魏的作风。牛儿堂前檐连柱早已崩塌，在檐口现在还看得见残留的石刻枓栱。
    在东崖较低处有第○四三号崖阁，也是三间四柱，但内部的结构不一样。长廊有六点六七公尺，两端两天王立像都在，中间只有一个龛，在中座佛的背壁上部的装饰是浮塑双龙头的椅背，椅后两龙女礼佛献珠，露出半身。在背壁下半部近地面又向后通一个阴湿的洞穴。传说就是古代的湫洞，过去农民苦旱的时候，就来这个崖阁求雨。就阁里的塑像说，是在初唐的塑像上经过各有不同程度的后代修饰。龛内两侧壁还凿有两耳龛，里面却残存着魏代的壁画，从这点可以知道这崖阁建造时代也是很早的。这里的檐下没有枓栱而代之以浮刻的“火焰宝珠”。像这种有汉代建筑传统的石造檐柱崖阁，仅在东崖有七处。
    西崖的石窟群，正像五代人所说的：“……其间千房万屋，缘空蹑虚，登之者不敢回顾……”〔注二〕，可见龛窟之多，攀登之险。到目前为止，这里由栈道可通的有九十个洞。从地面到西崖的最高处，共十二层龛架（直升距离五二点一一公尺），都是凌空架栈，在第八层，又分东西两线栈道。
    西崖东线上最大的洞窟“碑洞”（第一三三号），内部高五点九七公尺，横宽一四点九一公尺，最纵深处一一点五八公尺，是建筑结构复杂特殊的一个窟，窟内复室叠龛，所有壁面都满缀着无数的小“影塑”贤劫千佛。有的龛楣上还塑着小的供养人立体像及山水背景浮塑。包括有西魏及比较晚期各代的作品共有三十座，以迎门的接引佛立像最高（三点五公尺），这是一尊经宋代修过，但还保存着有唐塑风格的大造像，艺术技巧很高，尤其是两只手，生动地表现了敏锐的触觉感。这个窟的顶部是和平面图一样，不规则的多边凸凹形。在天顶的正左部分是平天花板，上面满绘着飞天。但岩石风化特甚，画已大部剥落漫漶。在右外顶间，则是覆斗藻井，这是奇特的结构。洞窟的正壁渗水，因此十分潮湿，不仅严重侵蚀了天花壁画，石雕像也面目模糊了。但是这个窟内还保藏着好些造像碑。在十八块完整的中间以描写“佛传”的一块为最富变化最生动。因为这个窟里佛像最多，所以很早就被称为“万佛堂”。也因为窟内藏着许多造像碑，我们就叫它做“碑洞”。
    再向上走，到东线栈道的顶点，就是第一三五号窟，这是西崖的最高处，人们叫它做“天堂洞”。这个天堂洞是一个简单的矩形窟，高五公尺，广八点八八公尺，深四点二九公尺。壁间画的是古代骑战的场面，多已剥落褪色。在窟门的上端凿通窗洞三个，类似这样的造窟结构是很少的。三面壁间凿成的龛内有北魏的造像，是经宋代重加修塑的。在窟的中间立着一尊高一点九五公尺的及其左右立着两尊高一点二八公尺的石造像。这些大件的魏代石刻风格的造像所用的石材，是比较坚固的带灰红色的硬沙石，不是本山开采的。我们很惊讶，不能想像在当时（一千五百年前）完全用人工体力如何能把三四吨重的大石块从地面升起移置到五十多公尺高的洞窟中去。
    走上西崖的西线栈道，到最高层，进入第一二七号窟，是西崖三大窟中最小的一个。高四点四二公尺，广八点六三公尺，深四点八五公尺。造像以正壁的一龛西魏石刻像为最精致生动。藻井和四壁的全面，无处不是画，虽然有剥落，残褪，但比较其他各窟，还是完整些。
    在西崖第一六五号窟里宋代重塑菩萨和供养人像，应该认为是宋塑中杰出的作品。从早期的造像发展到这个时期，很清楚的看出从神的、理想的逐渐发展到人的、现实的。在塑造的后壁上还保留着残破的背光装饰画，色彩和花纹，以及留在壁间原塑衣带的痕迹，都说明这个洞窟是北魏早期的建造。
    正因为这山崖的石质是一种砾岩，不宜于做石刻，因此麦积山的造像，绝大多数是塑的。数以千计的塑像（无数的小影塑不在内），如大的高至一五点二八公尺的东崖第○一三号摩崖大佛像和一三点八八公尺的西崖第○九八号摩崖大佛像，以及许多高仅二十多公分的造像，都是塑的。集上下一千三四百年来的民族的优秀的创造在一起，像这样一个宝藏，是世界稀有的！可是麦积山石窟屡遭厄运；原来是“有龛皆是佛，无壁不飞天”，而现存的塑像很多断颈折臂，壁画也毁损得太厉害了。由于各种原因的破坏，如岩石崩坠，气候潮湿，燕雀做窝，松鼠打洞，山蜂钻孔，和避乱人居住时炊烟的熏灼，甚至火灾、盗挖，以及历代游人的题字、涂抹等等，这些自然的和人为的破坏，使珍贵的石窟艺术遭受了不可计数的损失，有的洞窟更已破坏到一无所存了（如东崖的第○三四号窟，西崖的第○六三号，第○六六号，第○五二号，第一五三号等窟）。
    通过这些残存的宝藏，我们依然可以看到古代人民在造型艺术上的光辉成就。他们在创造中反映了当时人民生活的形象。这些作品充满了新鲜活泼、飞跃腾动的美感，它们真正继承了汉晋的优秀的艺术传统，启发了唐宋的更进一步走向现实主义的道路，在中国美术史上展开了光辉的一章。
    我们没有关于石窟的明确的历史，只能在记载中去找散见的材料，知道早在汉晋的几百年间（公元前第三世纪到公元后第三世纪），麦积山已不断在历史上提到。在十六国兵马争逐的时期（公元四世纪）更是割据王朝的界隘要冲。先不肯定石窟的开始建造年代，但是我们知道当公元四世纪末和五世纪初，麦积崖已经是兴盛的佛教中心了（见梁高僧传玄高条）。我们在第一一五号窟里所发见的造像座上墨写发愿文“景明三年……”（公元五○二年），不过是许多早期石窟中间偶然有年号可查的一个，当然还不一定就是最早凿的。我们这次发现的“洛阳沙弥法生造龛碑”，以及北周李允信造七佛龛铭，虽碑记确凿，但也不能肯定是指那一个龛窟。
    再根据各种记载，我们可以找出石窟兴废的规律。每次大规模的修建复兴，主要都是在一个封建王朝盛世的开始和在地震或是变乱之后。统计从公元六世纪初开始，一直到十八世纪，就有过八次间隔的系列的大小地震。从西魏文帝重修崖阁起，一直到清乾隆重修瑞应寺，其中修理过不知多少次，隋文帝时更大规模地修建过塑像。初唐、宋都留有卓越的作品。元朝有过四次地震，但这里没有发现元代的代表作。到明清的妆修则都有明确的题证留在壁上。经过这样多次损毁和多次修理，因此崖壁有先后刊凿，重叠妆銮，壁画也有表里几层，重复绘制。往往有的窟是魏代修建，画是明代重绘；有的魏代壁画，宋代塑像。有些较晚造的摩崖大佛像下面压着早期的残壁画。这样错综复杂的情况，还需要专家们进一步研究。
    在过去反动统治的年月里，古代文物被废弃、被蹧蹋，和被帝国主义者不断盗窃，是司空见惯的，那种惊人的痛心损失真是难以估量。但是今天，新中国站起来了。中国的古代艺术遗产只有在共产党和人民政府的领导之下，才受到了尊重和爱护，才普遍地教育人民重视自己的民族文化，这是我们的祖先所创造和遗留下来的艺术财富，今天回到人民的手里来了。各地人民和干部，应该切实执行中央的有关法令，认真负起保护这些遗产的责任。为了发展人民的新艺术，我们必须吸收古代优秀的民族艺术遗产的精萃。
