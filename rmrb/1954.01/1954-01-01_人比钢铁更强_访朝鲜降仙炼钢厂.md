People Are Stronger Than Steel
    —A Visit to the Jiangxian Steel Plant in North Korea
    Jin Feng, Gao Fen
     On August 3, 1953, a week after the Korean Armistice Agreement, Premier Kim Il-sung visited the Jiangxian Steel Plant near Pyongyang. Standing on the ruins, he called on the steelworkers who had persisted in production in the caves for three years, saying, "We should use our own strength to restore this factory as quickly as possible. The Republic needs steel today as much as it did during the war."
    On September 15th, the Republic's first steel furnace to be restored after the war – the No. 2 steel furnace at the Jiangxian Steel Plant – was ignited.
    At the end of November, we visited this heroic factory.
    We were immediately met by the newly repaired, tall steel frames, standing proudly in the ruins. The open-air workshops echoed with the songs of the determined builders. But not far away was a large bomb crater, filled with water, resembling a small pond, now covered with thick ice. Looking along the bomb crater, we saw a scene of destroyed steel frames, some tilted, some half-tilted, and some piled on the ground like scattered wire. Comrade Li Gui Feng, the factory director who accompanied us, picked up two heavy machine gun bullets from the ground and began to talk about the factory's situation during the war. From the first day of the war, this factory was subjected to indiscriminate bombing by American air bandits. In just two days, May 23rd and 24th, 1952, American planes came in more than 900 sorties, dropping thousands of bombs around the factory, completely destroying the remaining factory buildings.
    But people are stronger than steel. Throughout the war, production at this steel plant continued.
    At this moment, an old worker in his forties came to greet us. The factory director introduced him as Park Gap-dong, a steelworker who had remained in the factory to persist in production. He had thirty years of experience, and after liberation, he personally participated in the construction of the Bessemer converter. During the war, he watched helplessly as his Bessemer furnace fell in the explosions and flames. So, like a mother rescuing her child, he rushed into the fire with his comrades to save the machines, moved them to the caves for repair, and continued to produce hand grenades, artillery parts, and engineering tools. He often slept only three or four hours a day and often stayed at the factory for a month without going home, lying next to the machines. When the power was cut off, he manually operated the blower. This is how he supported the front lines.
    Most of the male workers went to the front lines, and the women and girls wielded their heavy shovels and went to work. Yoon Hwa-bok, the female worker who accompanied us, was only twenty years old, and looked like such a gentle girl. It was she who, during the war, went from watching one machine to watching three, and from operating the fine wire rolling machine to the coarse wire rolling machine. She not only mastered the technology but also broke the male workers' record. Normally, two male workers could only pull 305 kilograms of wire a day, but she pulled 300 kilograms of wire every day.
    Where did these forces come from?
    "Hatred," Park Gap-dong replied without hesitation, "Hatred gives us the greatest strength." Yesterday, the comrade who was still working together, the child who was still being teased, today only an arm and a small hat are seen. The machines that were installed by hand became piles of scrap iron. "At that time, I wanted to bite the American planes if they fell down!" Park Gap-dong, who was always smiling cheerfully, became somber, and he gritted his teeth and said.
    But when he turned and saw the tall steel frames, his face lit up again, and he said forcefully, "The enemy can bomb, we can repair, and we will repair it even better."
    Together with him, we came to the famous No. 2 steel furnace. At this time, steel was being tapped, and the molten steel poured into each mold, casting fiery red steel ingots. The steel ingots began to cool and turned bluish-gray. Factory director Li Gui Feng and Park Gap-dong introduced us to the restoration of the steel furnace.
    On August 8th, five days after Premier Kim Il-sung visited the factory, the factory began the restoration work of the No. 2 steel furnace. The situation at that time was difficult, with insufficient manpower and materials, and the furnace was severely damaged: both the inside and outside were rusted, the reducer and elevator on the furnace were destroyed, and even a piece of the furnace bottom was blown hundreds of meters away.
    But what difficulties could intimidate the heroic Korean workers? If there was not enough manpower, they worked like two people in one.
      "The workers worked like a fire," the factory director recalled the scene at the time. There were no dormitories in the factory, and the workers lived far away. To save time, the team set a meal time, and family members sent meals to the factory. The Power Department team simply built a temporary house on the ruins and lived together. They worked outdoors during the day and were still busy with switchboards in the house late into the night. Boiler worker Han Jin-soo worked on parts for four boilers for three days and three nights without sleep.
    If there were no materials, they searched for them in the ruins. More than 30 workers from the Power Department collected more than 8,000 meters of high-voltage wires that had been blown into pieces, connected them, and solved the needs of all high-voltage lines. Park Gap-dong pointed to an August 15th crane on the roof and said proudly, "This is a gift from the workers for Liberation Day, all assembled from waste materials in seven days."
    The peasant brothers in the nearby villages also extended their helping hands. Farmers in Jiangxi and other counties contributed 13,000 workdays to build 150 dormitories for the workers. The children of Jiangxi Middle School sent the workers 350 large pumpkins they had grown, and the chairman of the Democratic Women's League of Taixing Village sent hay and straw bags. To thank them for their support, the workers used their spare time to make more than 3,000 pieces of farm tools and other household items to give to them. Speaking of this, the factory director pointed to the fields outside the factory connected by ridges and said, "Our factory and the farm were originally one family!"
    After more than a month of intense labor, the No. 2 steel furnace was finally ignited and steel was tapped. Speaking of this, the faces of the determined factory director and Park Gap-dong both showed a comforting smile.
    "Since the official steel tapping on September 20th," Chief Technician Cui Feng-woo continued, "due to the continuous research of the workers, there have been improvements and improvements in the method of loading, the speed of steel tapping, and the amount of steel tapped." He pointed to the piles of furnace wreckage on the factory side and said, "The No. 1 steel furnace can be repaired by the end of December. In March next year, the third and fourth steel furnaces can also be ignited. The alloy iron plant, rolling mill, machine factory, mold factory, and wire pressing factory will all be restored next year. The restored factories will adopt the most advanced Soviet technology and experience, and most of them will be automated, better and more beautiful than before."
    Hearing this plan, we were both excited and astonished. We asked the chief technician to talk about the various conditions that could allow such a rapid recovery. "Material conditions?" The chief technician showed a very confident smile, pointing to the rolling mill that had just been unpacked. We walked closer and saw that it was made in Budapest and had just arrived at the factory yesterday. "And the Soviet Union, China, and our own," the chief technician said, happily extending three fingers. "As for the technical conditions," he continued without a pause, "the Party sees farther than us. As early as during the war, a large number of technicians and technicians were transferred to the Soviet Union and China to study. For example, them," the chief technician pointed to Park Gap-dong and a young female technician, Huang Fan-suk, who was busy in front of the furnace, "they just returned from internships in the Soviet Union and China's Anshan Iron and Steel in June this year."
    At this time, a roaring crane was passing overhead, and the chief technician smiled and told us that the crane was operated by a new girl from the countryside named Jin Yu-fen, who learned to operate the crane three days after coming to the factory. "Our large labor force will be solved in this way, and the countryside will provide us with a large reserve of labor," the chief technician said happily, "Of the more than 100 workers in front of the steel furnace, only eight are original technicians, and most of them are young men and women from the countryside, and they are now very skilled in operating in front of the steel furnace."

    人比钢铁更强
    ——访朝鲜降仙炼钢厂
    金凤　高汾
     一九五三年八月三日，朝鲜停战一个星期以后，金日成首相来到平壤附近的降仙炼钢厂。站在废墟上，他号召在山洞中一直坚持了三年生产的钢铁工人说：“我们应该用自己的力量尽速恢复这个工厂，共和国今天需要钢铁和战时一样。”
    九月十五日，共和国战后恢复的第一个炼钢炉——降仙炼钢厂二号炼钢炉开始点火了。
    十一月底，我们访问了这个英雄工厂。
    迎面就看到刚修复的高大的钢架子，在废墟中挺然矗立着。露天的车间响着顽强的建设者的歌声。但是走过不远就是一个大炸弹坑，坑里有水，仿佛一个小水池，现在已经结了厚冰。沿着炸弹坑一眼望过去，只见一片被炸毁的钢架子有的倾斜了，有的半倾斜着，有的则像散乱的铁丝一样堆在地面上。陪我们参观的厂长李圭凤同志，一边从地上拣起两颗重机枪子弹，一边就谈起这个厂在战争中的情况。从战争开始的第一天起，这座工厂就受到美国空中强盗的滥炸。仅仅一九五二年五月二十三、二十四两天，美国飞机就来了九百多架次，在这个工厂周围投下了成千颗炸弹，把仅余的厂房全部炸毁了。
    但是人比钢铁更强。整个战争时期，这座炼钢厂的生产一直在继续着。
    这时，一位四十多岁的老工人迎上前来，厂长给我们介绍，他就是一直留在厂里坚持生产的炼钢工人朴甲东。他已有三十年工龄了，解放后他亲手参加修建了贝氏炼钢炉。而在战争中他眼睁睁地看着自己的贝氏炉在爆炸声中、在烈火中倒下来。于是他就像母亲抢救自己的孩子那样闯进火中和伙伴们一起抢救机器，把机器搬到山洞中抢修起来，继续生产着手榴弹、大炮零件和工兵用具。常常一天
  一夜只睡三四个钟头，常常一个月都不回家，就躺在机器旁边。常常停电了，就用手摇着鼓风炉。他这样支援前线。
    绝大部分男工都上前线去了，妇女和姑娘们就使起他们沉重的铁锹顶着干。陪我们一起参观的女工尹华福，才二十岁，看上去是那么温柔的一位姑娘。就是她，在战争中从看一台机器到看三台机器，从拉细铁丝的立卷机站到拉粗铁丝的横卷机上去。她不仅掌握了技术，还打破了男工的纪录。平时两个男工一天只拉三百零五公斤铁丝，而她每天却拉出三百公斤的铁丝。
    这些力量是从那里来的呢？
    “仇恨，”朴甲东毫不犹豫地回答，“仇恨使我们产生最大的力量。”昨天还在一起工作的伙伴，还被人们逗着玩的孩子，今天就只见到一条胳膊，一顶小帽子了。亲手安装起来的机器，变成一堆堆废铁了。“那时美国飞机要摔下来，我啃也要啃它几口！”总是爽朗地笑着的朴甲东的脸色阴沉起来，他咬牙切齿地说。
    但是当他转身看到高高竖立起来的钢架子，他的脸色又兴奋起来，他有力地说：“敌人能炸，我们能修，我们要修得更好。”
    我们和他一起，来到著名的二号炼钢炉前。这时，正在出钢，火红的钢水倾泻到一个个铸模中，铸成一根根火红的钢锭。钢锭开始冷却了，变成铁青色。厂长李圭凤和朴甲东一起向我们介绍修复炼钢炉的情形。
    八月八日，金日成首相来厂后的第五天，工厂就开始了二号炼钢炉的修复工作。当时情况是困难的，人力不够，材料不足，炉子破坏得十分严重：里外都生了锈，炉上的减速机，升降机都毁了，连炉底一块肚皮也被炸到几百公尺之外。
    但是有什么困难可以吓倒英勇的朝鲜工人呢？人力不够，他们一个人顶两个人干。
      “工人们干活像一团火似的。”厂长回忆着当时的情景。厂里没有宿舍，工人又都住得远，为了节省时间，小组规定了吃饭时间，由家属送饭到厂里。动力部小组干脆自己动手在废墟上搭起一个临时房子，大伙一起起伙住宿。他们白天在露天赶活，晚上深更半夜还在屋里忙着配电盘。锅炉工人韩镇秀配四个锅炉的零件连着三天三夜没有睡。
    没有材料，他们就到废墟中寻找。动力部三十多名工人，搜集了八千多公尺被炸得寸断的高压线，把它接起来，解决了全部高压线的需要。朴甲东指着屋顶上一架八一五号起重机自豪地说：“这是工人给解放日的献礼，全部用废料在七天中装起来的。”
    附近的农民兄弟们也伸出了他们支援的手来。江西等郡的农民出了一万三千个工，为工人盖了一百五十间宿舍。江西中学的孩子们给工人送来了自己栽种的三百五十个大南瓜，泰星里的民主妇女同盟委员长送来了干草和草袋。为了答谢他们的支持，工人们利用业余时间做了三千多件农具和其他家庭用具送给他们。说到这里，厂长指着厂外四周阡陌相连的农田说：“我们工厂和农庄本来是一家呀！”
    经过一个多月紧张的劳动，二号炼钢炉终于点火出钢了。谈到这里，坚毅的厂长和朴甲东的脸上都流露出安慰的微笑。
    “自从九月二十日正式出钢到现在，”技师长崔凤瑀又接过来说，“由于工人不断的钻研，在装料方法、出钢速度和出钢量方面都有了改进和提高。”他又指着厂房那边一堆一堆的炉子残骸说，“十二月底，第一号炼钢炉就可以修好。明年三月第三、四号炼钢炉也可以点火了。合金铁厂、压延厂、机械厂、铸模厂和压线厂明年也都全部要恢复起来。恢复起来的工厂将采用苏联最先进的技术和经验，大部分都是自动化的，比以前更美更好。”
    听见这一计划，我们又是兴奋，又是惊愕。我们请求技师长谈一谈能够这样迅速恢复的各种条件。“物质条件么？”技师长露出十分自信的微笑，指着刚刚开箱的压延机。我们走近一看，是布达佩斯的出品，昨天刚刚到厂。“还有苏联，中国和我们自己的”，技师长说着愉快地伸出三个手指。“至于技术条件，”他不稍停顿就谈下去：“党比我们看得更远。早在战争时期就抽调了大批技术工人和技师去苏联和中国学习。譬如他们，”技师长指着朴甲东和一位正在炉前忙碌着的年轻的女技师黄范淑说，“这就是今年六月才从苏联和中国鞍钢实习回来的。”
    这时候，轰轰的起重机正从头顶上开过，技师长又笑着告诉我们，掌握这架起重机的是一位新从农村来的姑娘，名叫金玉粉，她来工厂三天就学会了开起重机。“我们大批的劳动力就将这样解决，农村将供给我们大批劳动力的后备军，”技师长很高兴地这样说，“炼钢炉前一百多名工人，只有八名是原来的技工，大多数都是农村来的男女青年，他们现在都已经很熟练地在炼钢炉前操作了。”（附图片）
