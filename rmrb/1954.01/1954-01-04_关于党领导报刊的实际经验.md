From the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Moscow Oblast Committee Secretary, Telietyakova

It is obvious that the Party pays great attention to the work of improving the political and ideological level of newspapers, and tirelessly cares about strengthening the mobilizing and organizing role of newspapers in economic and cultural construction. Soviet newspapers are a powerful weapon for educating the masses and improving their organization in the struggle to win communism.

The September Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee formulated a grand program for further developing agriculture, the realization of which will specifically solve the task of making Soviet agricultural products and industrial raw materials abundant. The Party and the Soviet government are organizing a leap in the production of consumer goods for the people.

The task of strengthening the Party's leadership over newspapers is now even more urgent. Only when the Party's leadership over newspapers and magazines adapts to the new and growing demands can Soviet newspapers play their role as collective agitators, propagandists, and organizers of the masses.

In order to correctly lead newspapers, it is important to be good at enabling newspapers to elaborate on the main things, and to focus the attention of newspaper editorial departments on the main and fundamental issues in the work of Party organizations.

Currently, the tasks facing the Party and Soviet organizations, and facing all agricultural workers in the Moscow Oblast, are to maximize the yield of potatoes and vegetables in order to basically meet the needs of the residents of Moscow and many industrial centers in the Moscow Oblast in the next few years. It is necessary to greatly increase the yield of these crops on the basis of widespread use of mechanization and advanced cultivation methods. At the same time, in the development of animal husbandry, along with the growth of the total number of livestock, it is also necessary to vigorously increase the output of livestock and poultry products, which requires improving the feed base, increasing the harvest of grasses, and widely planting those high-yielding feed crops, such as corn, pumpkins, gourds, and fodder cabbage.

These most important issues in the agricultural development of this oblast have also been raised to the state, municipal and district newspapers.

The Party's Oblast Committee, in order to implement the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "On Measures for the Further Development of Soviet Agriculture," adopted a resolution "On Propaganda Work of Party Organizations." This resolution defined the tasks of the oblast's newspapers in publicizing the resolutions of the Central Plenary Session and in the struggle to achieve the concrete implementation of these resolutions.

We have fixed the system of meetings for newspaper workers in the oblast. One such meeting was held at the end of October. This meeting was used to summarize the experience accumulated by the oblast, municipal, and district newspapers and wall newspapers in the struggle to implement the instructions of the September Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee. The Party's Oblast Committee convenes monthly meetings of the editors-in-chief of the city and district newspapers. At these meetings, we often invite secretaries of Party organizations, scientific workers, agronomists, zoologists, mechanics, and editorial staff to participate. Experience has shown that such meetings can most flexibly and effectively influence the content of newspapers and can draw the attention of newspapers to issues related to economic construction and the Party's political work that the Party organizations of the oblast are actively resolving.

As everyone knows, the Party's leadership over newspapers is primarily manifested in the ideological level of newspapers, their Party spirit, and principles. Therefore, when we enable newspapers to elaborate on various issues in economic construction and Party work, we strive to improve the ideological level of newspapers so that every statement in the newspapers can improve the political and productive enthusiasm of the working people. For this purpose, we regularly listen to the reports of the editors-in-chief of the oblast, municipal, and district newspapers at the standing committee of the Party's Moscow Oblast Committee. This year, we discussed the work of "Moscow Truth," "Moscow Komsomolets," and "Moscow Boiler Room News," and listened to the issues related to improving municipal and district newspapers.

The Party Committee can only truly influence the content of newspapers and guide the activities of the editorial department under the condition of regular, in-depth, and comprehensive leadership. In this regard, the experience of the Megichinsk City Committee is worthy of attention. The city's "Road to Victory News" regularly receives instructions and assistance from the City Committee. The work of this newspaper has been discussed at the plenary sessions of the City Committee; the City Committee also regularly reviews the plans of the newspaper's editorial department at the standing committee, helping it to better elaborate on the issues of Party life and economic construction.

The secretary of the Party's City Committee regularly reports to the editorial staff on the current tasks of the region, explaining which issues need to be raised in the newspaper. Due to the City Committee's constant attention, "Road to Victory News" plays a significant role in the life of the Party organization.

The most important issue in the Party's leadership over newspapers is the issue of cadres. The success of newspaper work, like all other work, depends on people. The level and ideological content of newspapers are mainly determined by who leads them and who works in the editorial department. We strive to select cadres who have been tempered by the Party, are knowledgeable, principled, and familiar with the news publishing business to lead newspaper work. The Moscow Oblast Committee of the Party has vigorously strengthened the editors-in-chief, team leaders, and copy editors of the city and district newspapers this year, and transferred twenty-four experienced news cadres from Moscow to work in local newspapers for a long time.

The nature of newspaper work itself requires news cadres to constantly progress, constantly expand their political horizons, and improve their general cultural level and their writing skills. The Party's Oblast Committee has organized the systematic study of editorial staff. From August to October this year, a one-month study group was held for the secretaries of the editorial departments of various newspapers, as well as a one-week study group for the team leaders, deputy editors-in-chief, and industrial and agricultural team leaders of mass work and readers' letters in city and district newspapers. The curriculum of these study groups was approved by the secretary of the Party's Moscow Oblast Committee.

In addition to giving reports to newspaper staff, the study groups also organized them to intern at "Moscow Truth." Since September 1st this year, 36 city and district newspapers have opened three-month training classes for editorial staff and active writers; the trainees have exceeded 800 people.

Newspaper reviews and articles in columns such as "Newspaper Topics," "Readers Talk About Newspapers," and "Last Mail," etc., are effective tools for leading newspapers and improving the level of newspapers.

Party committees cannot but be concerned about the popularization and mass character of newspaper language. The popularization and mass character of newspaper language largely determine the influence of newspapers on the masses. Therefore, we strive to make newspapers speak to readers in simple and vivid language.

Wall newspapers and printed small newspapers also require the constant attention of Party organizations. Nearly 2,000 kinds of wall newspapers are distributed in collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms in the Moscow Oblast, and these wall newspapers have thousands of different supplements, such as "Battle Pages," "Alarm Signals," and "Satirical Pages." Our people love and value bright laughter, humor, and jokes. Meaningful cartoons, sharp sketches, satirical poems, fables, or limericks published on wall newspapers, that is, in the "Crocodile" of the collective farm—are all easy-to-understand and effective forms of criticism.

In many districts, short-term training classes for editors of collective farm wall newspapers are held every month, and conferences of worker and peasant correspondents are convened, at which the secretaries of the city and district committees give reports.

Improving the Party's leadership over newspapers has raised the level of many newspapers and their role in the life of Party organizations. The newspaper's propaganda on advanced agricultural experiences has become wider and more active.

The newspaper elaborates on the issues of mechanization and the adoption of advanced cultivation methods when planting potatoes and vegetables—square cluster planting method, and cultivating vegetable seedlings in peat humus containers, etc., and the newspaper also publishes articles on equipping tractor stations with skilled cadres, establishing greenhouse and hotbed equipment, and the work experience of rural Party organizations.

Due to the attention paid by the Party committee and its publications to the adoption of advanced cultivation methods in agricultural production, this year, 86,000 hectares of potatoes in the Moscow Oblast—accounting for two-thirds of the total area—were cultivated using the square cluster planting method. This enabled collective farms to save approximately two million workdays in this regard in 1953 and to obtain a greater harvest.

Our city and district newspapers have studied agricultural production more deeply. Its elaboration on the work of collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations is also more informative.

The "Road to Communism News" of the Lukhovitskaya District successfully elaborated on the issue of developing agriculture. The Lukhovitskaya District is a vast agricultural area dominated by animal husbandry. The collective farm named after Stalin is an advanced farm in the district. The chairman of the farm—Comrade Generalov, the Soviet hero of socialist labor—published an article in the newspaper on how to develop public animal husbandry. The secretary of the Party organization, Comrade Potezlov, the zoologist Comrade Valistin, and the milkmaid—the socialist labor hero Roshenova—also exchanged their work experience in the newspaper.

The Central September Plenary Session paid special attention to backward collective farms. But newspapers rarely point out the shortcomings in the work of these farms, and it is extremely important to help these farms reveal the reasons for their backwardness and point out the direction for their advancement. For the above purpose, "Road to Communism News," in a special issue titled "The Budyonny Collective Farm Should Be Included in the Advanced Ranks," pointed out how the Party organization and the collective farm management office of the collective farm are fighting to overcome the backward state and restore the inherent reputation of the collective farm.

The "Road to Lenin News" of the Lenin District, the "Road Along Lenin News" of the Mochaisk District, and the "Strive for Electrification News" of the Kasirsk District also published many valuable and interesting articles on agricultural issues. In the collective farms in the oblast, there are more and more wall newspapers with a fighting spirit and initiative.

But on the other hand, it is not correct if we do not see the serious shortcomings that still exist in the work of the Moscow Oblast Party Committee and the city and district Party committees in leading newspapers. Some Party committees lack concern for the ideological level of the articles and communications published in the newspapers, lack due attention to the selection of newspaper cadres, and the struggle for the propaganda effect of newspapers is also insufficient. Party workers and leaders of Soviet and economic institutions rarely speak in newspapers.

The content of some of our newspapers is still bland and lifeless, and many formulaic and untimely articles appear in these newspapers. At the same time, Party committees and the editorial departments of some city and district newspapers are not concerned enough about the printing and layout technology of newspapers.

"Moscow Truth" and many city and district newspapers rarely publish critical articles when publicizing the advanced experience of excellent collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, and lack in-depth analysis of the shortcomings existing in the work of some backward districts, backward collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, which are not small in number in the Moscow Oblast. We must change this magnanimous attitude in elaborating on agricultural issues, and we must actively fight against these shortcomings.

"Moscow Truth" is weak and often unskilled in elaborating on the issue of ideological work. It rarely publishes propaganda articles related to the resolutions of the Central September Plenary Session; and in some articles that have been published, it has failed to regularly combine them with the reality of local life.

The Party's requirements for all our newspapers are constantly increasing. In order to meet the Party's requirements, we should systematically improve the Party's leadership over newspapers and improve the ideological level of newspapers.

    关于党领导报刊的实际经验
    苏共莫斯科州委会书记  特列琪雅科娃
    党非常注意提高报纸的政治思想水平的工作，不倦地关心加强报刊在经济文化建设中的动员和组织作用，这是很明显的。苏维埃报刊是在争取共产主义胜利斗争中教育群众、提高他们的组织性的有力武器。
    党中央委员会九月全体会议拟定了进一步发展农业的宏伟纲领，这个纲领的实现将使苏联农产品及工业原料臻于富足的任务得以具体解决。党和苏维埃政府正在组织着人民消费品生产的飞跃上升。
    加强党对报刊的领导的任务，现在更显得迫切了。只有在党对报纸和杂志的领导适应于新的日益增长的要求的水平情况之下，苏维埃报刊才能发挥其作为群众的集体鼓动者、宣传者和组织者的作用。
    为了正确地领导报刊，重要的就是善于使报刊去阐述主要的事物，把报纸编辑部的注意力集中于党组织工作中主要的根本问题上。
      现在，摆在党和苏维埃组织面前的、摆在所有莫斯科州农业工作者面前的任务是，最大限度地提高马铃薯和蔬菜的产量，以求在最近数年内能够基本上满足莫斯科和莫斯科州许多工业中心区居民的需求。必须在广泛采用机械化和先进耕作方法的基础上使这些作物的收获量大大提高。同时，在饲畜业的发展中，随着牲畜总头数的增长，也要大力提高牲畜和禽类的产品量，这就需要改善饲料基地，提高草类的收获量，并广泛地种植那些高额产量的饲料作物，如玉蜀黍、南瓜、瓢瓜及饲料白菜。
    本州农业发展的这些最重要的问题，也就提到州、市和区的报纸面前来了。
      党的州委员会为贯彻苏共中央九月全体会议“关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施”的决议，而通过了一项“关于党组织宣传鼓动工作”的决议。这个决议确定了本州报刊在宣传中央全体会议的决议和争取这些决议具体实现的斗争中的任务。
    我们已经固定地实行了州的报刊工作者会议制度。十月底就曾举行过一次这样的会议。这一次会议是用来总结州、市、区级报纸和墙报在执行党中央九月全体会议指示的斗争中累积起来的经验的。党的州委会每月召集各市、区报纸总编辑会议。在这些会议上我们时常邀请一些党组织的书记、科学工作者、农学家、动物学家、机械师和编辑工作人员参加。经验证明，这样的会议能够最灵活和最有效地影响报纸的内容，能够引起报纸对州的党组织正在积极解决中的有关经济建设与党的政治工作诸问题的注意。
    大家知道，党对报纸的领导首先表现在报纸的思想水平、它们的党性、原则性。因此，当我们使报纸阐明经济建设与党的工作中的各种问题时，我们力求提高报纸的思想水平，以求报纸的每一言论都能提高劳动人民的政治和生产积极性。为此目的，我们经常地在党的莫斯科州委会的常委会上听取州、市和区报纸总编辑的报告。今年，我们曾讨论了“莫斯科真理报”、“莫斯科青年团员报”、“莫斯科锅炉房报”的工作，并听取了有关改进市报和区报纸的措施的问题。
    党委会只有在经常地、深刻地、全面地进行领导的情况之下，才能真正地影响报纸的内容，指导编辑部的活动。在这方面，梅基钦斯克市委会的经验是值得重视的。该市“胜利之路报”经常地从市委会那里得到指示和帮助。在市委会的全体会议上曾讨论了这个报纸的工作；市委并经常在常委会上审查报纸编辑部的计划，帮助它更好地阐明党的生活与经济建设的问题。
    党的市委书记经常向编辑部工作人员报告本地区当前的任务，说明哪些问题是需要在报纸上提出来的。由于市委会这样的经常的注意，“胜利之路报”在党组织的生活中就起着显著的作用。
    党对报刊领导的最重要的问题就是干部问题。报纸工作和所有其它的工作一样，成就是取决于人的。报纸的水平与思想内容主要地是决定于谁领导着它，哪些人在编辑部里工作。我们竭力挑选那些经过党的锻炼、知识丰富的、有原则性的和熟悉新闻出版业务的干部去领导报纸工作。莫斯科州委会今年曾大力地加强了各市和区报纸的总编辑、组长及文字编辑人员，并自莫斯科抽调了二十四名有经验的新闻干部，到地方报纸去长期工作。
    报纸工作本身性质，就需要新闻干部不断地进步，不断地扩大自己的政治眼界，提高一般的文化水平和自己的文字技巧。党的州委会组织了编辑工作人员的有系统的学习。自今年八月至十月，曾举办了以一月为期的各报编辑部秘书人员的研究班，以及以一周为期的市级和区级报纸群众工作和读者来信组组长、副总编辑和工业与农业组组长的研究班。这些研究班的课程计划，由莫斯科州党的州委书记审定。
    研究班除了为报纸工作人员作报告以外，还组织他们到“莫斯科真理报”去实习。从今年九月一日起，已有三十六种市、区报纸为编辑人员和作家积极分子开办了为期三个月的训练班；训练班的学员业已超过了八百人。
    报刊述评以及“报纸论题”、“读者谈报纸”及“最后来邮”等等专栏的稿件，是领导报纸与提高报纸水平的有效工具。
    党委也不能不关心报纸语言的通俗化与群众性。报纸语言的通俗化和群众性在极大的程度上决定着报刊对群众的影响。因此，我们力求报纸用简明而生动的语言向读者讲话。
    墙报和印刷的小报也都需要党组织的经常注意。在莫斯科州的各集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场发行着近二千种墙报，这些墙报有成千种不同的附刊，如“战斗之页”、“警号”、“讽刺之页”。我国人民喜好并重视明朗的笑、诙谐和打趣。发表在墙报上，即发表在集体农庄的“鳄鱼”上的意义中肯的漫画、尖锐的小品文、讽刺诗、寓言或打油诗——都是易懂而有效的批评形式。
    在许多区里，每月都举办集体农庄墙报编辑人员的短期训练班，召开工、农通讯员会议，在会议上并由市委和区委书记作报告。
    改善党对报刊的领导，使许多报纸提高了水平及其在党组织生活中的作用。报纸对农业先进经验的宣传，已变得更广泛而主动。
    报纸阐明着机械化和在种植马铃薯和蔬菜时采用先进耕作法——方形簇种法，和在泥炭腐植容器里培植蔬菜作物的秧苗等等问题，报纸还发表有关为拖拉机站配备熟练的干部、建立温室和温床设备以及农村党组织的工作经验的论文。
    由于党委及其机关刊物对在农业生产中采用先进耕作方法的重视，今年莫斯科州有八万六千公顷的马铃薯——占总面积的三分之二，是采用方形簇种法耕作的。这就使集体农庄一九五三年在这方面节约了大约二百万个劳动日，并且得到更大的丰收。
    我们的市和区的报纸已更加深入研究农业生产。它对集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的工作的阐述，也更加富有内容了。
    鲁霍维茨卡雅区的“共产主义之路报”成功地阐明了发展农业的问题。鲁霍维茨卡雅区是一个以畜牧业为主的幅员辽阔的农业区。以斯大林命名的集体农庄是该区的一个先进农庄。该农庄主席——苏联社会主义劳动英雄格涅拉洛夫同志，在报纸上发表了关于如何发展公有产品畜牧业的文章。党组织的书记泡特兹洛夫同志、动物学家瓦里斯丁同志和挤奶女工——社会主义劳动英雄罗谢诺娃同志，也在报上交流他们的工作经验。
    中央九月全体会议曾特别注意落后的集体农庄。但是报纸很少指出这些农庄工作中的缺点，而帮助这些农庄揭露其落后的原因，并指出其前进的方向，这正是极其重要的。为了上述的目的“共产主义之路报”在以“布琼尼集体农庄应该归入先进之列”为题的一个专刊里，指出了该集体农庄的党组织和集体农庄管理处如何在克服落后状态，并为恢复集体农庄固有的声誉而斗争。
    列宁区的“列宁之路报”、莫查以斯克区的“沿着列宁的道路报”以及卡西尔斯克区的“争取电气化报”等也发表了许多有关农业问题的有价值、有兴趣的稿件。在州内各集体农庄中，富有战斗性和主动精神的墙报，已愈来愈多了。
    但是另一方面，如果我们不看到莫斯科州党委会以及各市、区党委在领导报刊工作中还存在着的严重缺点，这是不正确的。某些党委对发表在报纸上的论文和通讯的思想水平缺乏关心，对挑选报纸的干部缺少应有的重视，并且为报纸的宣传效果所做的斗争也是不够的。党的工作者、苏维埃和经济机构的领导人，还很少在报纸上发言。
    我们某些报纸的篇幅还是淡然无味、缺乏生气的，在这些报纸上出现着许多公式化的、不切时宜的文章。同时，党委和一些市、区报纸的编辑部对报纸印刷编排技术，也不够关心。
      “莫斯科真理报”及许多市、区报纸在宣传优秀的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站及国营农场的先进经验时，很少发表批评性的稿件，对于在莫斯科州为数不少的一些落后区、落后的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站及国营农场工作中存在的缺点，也缺乏深刻的分析。必须改变这种在阐明农业问题上的宽宏大量态度，必须和这些缺点进行积极的斗争。
      “莫斯科真理报”在阐述思想工作的问题上是软弱的，时常是不熟练的。它很少发表与中央九月全体会议的决议有关的宣传论文；而在一些已经刊登的论文中，又未能经常结合当地生活中的实际。
    党对我们所有报刊的要求，在不断地提高。为了满足党的要求，应该系统地改进党对报刊的领导，提高报纸的思想水平。
