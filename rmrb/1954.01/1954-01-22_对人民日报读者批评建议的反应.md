Reactions to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily

Central Personnel Department, Third Bureau

Has Taken Note of Preventing Repeated Transfers of Graduates

    A letter from the Third Bureau of the Central People's Government Personnel Department: The opinion "Suggestion to Avoid Repeated Transfers When Assigning Graduates," published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on November 24th, is helpful for the work of assigning university graduates. According to our understanding, the reasons for the phenomenon of repeated transfers of graduates are: First, the tasks of various departments often change. After the graduates are assigned, the departments adjust the distribution of cadres within their own system as their tasks change, resulting in repeated transfers. Second, some departments do not have a sufficient understanding of the needs of their affiliated units for graduates, and it is often difficult to formulate practical allocation plans in a timely manner. Therefore, they first transfer some graduates to the central government and then allocate them down. Third, the graduate allocation plans formulated by a few departments still have a certain degree of blindness, causing unnecessary repeated transfers of graduates. Fourth, in the allocation work, the department is not familiar enough with the use of graduates' majors, their personal practical difficulties, and the needs of the employing units, resulting in the allocation of some graduates to unsuitable jobs, which must be appropriately adjusted. Although it is difficult to completely avoid repeated transfers due to changes in work needs, the phenomenon of unnecessary repeated transfers of graduates, resulting in waste of manpower and material resources, is serious due to shortcomings in the allocation work. In the future, we will cooperate with various departments to pay attention to preventing the occurrence of this phenomenon.

Gui Sui County People's Government Has Begun to Handle

The Incident of Accumulation of Certificates of Revolutionary Soldiers

    A letter from the Gui Sui County People's Government: In the "Reader's Letters Summary" column of December 4th of last year, readers Guan Yao and others criticized our county's Civil Affairs Section for accumulating various certificates of revolutionary soldiers. After our inspection, the Civil Affairs Section has accumulated a total of twelve revolutionary soldier certificates, twenty-one revolutionary soldier martyr certificates, and twenty merit commendations in the past three years. Although some of these certificates did not have addresses or had inaccurate addresses, and some were wrongly sent or resent. However, the cadres in charge of this work in the Civil Affairs Section did not contact the troops in a timely manner to find out the addresses of the recipients of the certificates and forward them in a timely manner; they also did not contact the relevant units and transfer them in a timely manner for the certificates that should be transferred to other units for issuance. This irresponsible bureaucratic style has prevented some revolutionary soldiers' families and revolutionary martyrs' families from enjoying the honors or treatment they deserve for a long time, and has caused adverse effects politically.

    Now, we have ordered the Civil Affairs Section to quickly handle the accumulated certificates of the past. In addition to immediately contacting the troop organs that sent the certificates and other units that should forward the certificates, we also publicly announced the unclaimed certificates that could not be delivered in the Suiyuan Daily on October 28th of last year. In order to educate cadres and improve future work, we have ordered the relevant cadres to conduct self-criticisms and will give them due punishment according to the severity of the circumstances and the degree of self-criticism; in addition, we have also ordered them to apologize to the families of martyrs and soldiers who have not been able to enjoy preferential treatment in a timely manner in order to recover the political losses.

    中央人事部第三局
    已注意防止来回调动毕业生
    中央人民政府人事部第三局来信：十一月二十四日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了“建议分配毕业生工作时避免来回调动的现象”的意见，对高等学校毕业生分配工作是有帮助的。造成毕业生来回调动的现象的原因，据我们了解：一是由于各部门的任务常有变动，在毕业生分配后，各部门随着任务的改变，因而在干部的分配上又在本部门系统内进行调整，发生了来回调动现象。二是有的部门对其所属各单位需要毕业生的情况了解不够，往往难于及时制订切合实际的配备计划，于是先将部分毕业生调来中央，然后再分配下去。三是少数部门制订的毕业生调配计划尚有一定程度的盲目性，造成毕业生不必要的来回调动。四是在分配工作中，对毕业生所学科系用途、个人实际困难及使用单位的需要情况不够熟悉，造成少数毕业生分配的工作不够恰当，不得不予以适当调整。虽然根据工作需要情况的变动来回调动还难以完全避免，但由于分配工作中的缺点，造成毕业生不必要的来回调动，浪费人力物力的现象是严重的。今后我们当配合各部门注意防止这种现象的发生。
    归绥县人民政府已着手处理
    积压革命军人证明书的事件
    归绥县人民政府来信：去年十二月四日“读者来信摘要”栏中，读者关耀等对我县民政科积压革命军人各种证件的问题提出了批评。经我们检查，民政科三年来共积压革命军人证明书十二件、革命军人牺牲证明书二十一件、立功喜报二十件。这些证件，虽然有的未填地址或所填地址不确，有的是错发或重发的。但是，民政科主管这一工作的干部对未填地址或所填地址不确的证件没有及时和部队联系，查明收受证件人的地址，及时转发；对应该转给其它单位发出的证件也没有和有关单位联系，及时转出。这种不负责任的官僚主义作风，已使某些革命军人家属和革命烈士家属长期不能享受到应有的荣誉或待遇，并在政治上造成了不良影响。
    现在，我们已责成民政科迅速处理过去积压的证件，除立即和寄发证件的部队机关及应转发证件的其它单位联系外，并在去年十月二十八日绥远日报上公开招领无法投递的证明书。为了教育干部、改进今后工作，我们已责成有关干部进行检讨，并将根据情节轻重和检讨程度给予应得的处分；此外，还责成他们向未能及时享受优待的烈、军属道歉，以挽回政治上的损失。
