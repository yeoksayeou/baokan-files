Xinhua News Agency: Farmers in the Southwest region are confidently striving for victory in agricultural production in 1954. Led by mutual aid and cooperative organizations, farmers throughout the region are carrying out tasks such as pest control, winter plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy construction. Farmers in rice-growing areas of Sichuan and Guizhou provinces are vigorously controlling rice stem borers. Many farmers in Guanling, Luodian, Shibing, and Duyun counties of Guizhou Province are actively shoveling and burning rice roots to eliminate insect eggs and pupae. In some areas of Qujing and Yiliang prefectures in Yunnan Province, and in some areas of Yingjing, Hanyuan, and Baoxing counties in Xikang Province, small spring crops have been affected by wheat aphids and red spiders, which have been basically eradicated through rapid control measures. In terms of winter plowing, the winter paddy fields in Sichuan Province have generally been plowed and harrowed twice, and the better areas have been plowed and harrowed three times; farmers in the more central areas of Guizhou and Yunnan provinces have plowed and turned over 70 to 90 percent of the hardpan fields and winter soil respectively. In terms of fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy construction, the amount of fertilizer accumulated by farmers in Yunnan Province for small spring crops and spring plowing has generally increased by more than 10 percent compared to the same period in previous years. In order to increase grain production, farmers in Changshi Township, Bijie County, Guizhou Province, are actively repairing ditches and diverting water, which can irrigate nearly 8,000 mu of land in order to turn soil into fields. All provinces in the region have separately set out the task of increasing the production of grain and industrial raw material crops in 1954. Sichuan Province has decided to strive for another 6 percent increase in 1954 on the basis of the increase in 1953.
　　Farmers in the Southwest region made great contributions to increasing grain and industrial raw material production in 1953. The planting area, yield, and yield per unit area of grain crops in the region in 1953 all completed the planned targets. The total grain output increased by more than 7 percent compared with 1952. The output of flue-cured tobacco, tea, and silkworm cocoons increased significantly; the yield per unit area of cotton and rapeseed also increased. During the sowing period of small spring crops, farmers in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces responded to the call of the People's Government and actively expanded the planting area of oil crops.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 11th: After receiving education on the General Line, farmers in various parts of the Northwest actively implemented winter irrigation of farmland to ensure increased grain and cotton production this year. According to incomplete statistics, the area of farmland that has already undergone winter irrigation in the Northwest provinces has reached more than 16 million mu. Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces, as well as the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province and northern Shaanxi Province, have completed winter irrigation. The Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province and the southeastern part of Gansu Province are carrying out intensive winter irrigation, and winter irrigation work in southern Shaanxi Province will also be generally launched soon. In order to strive to produce more grain and cotton to sell to the state this year, the Moruxin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingluo County, Ningxia Province, specially selected Li Yaozhen, who is skilled in winter irrigation techniques, to lead the winter irrigation team, and timely irrigated more than 330 mu of grain fields and cotton fields. They also led 36 mutual aid groups and individual farmers in the whole township to smoothly irrigate more than 6,100 mu of farmland with winter water. After realizing the importance of increasing grain production for the country's economic construction, farmers in Anxi County, Gansu Province, universally repaired branch canals and farm canals, so that all 100,850 mu of paddy fields in the county were irrigated with winter water, and the irrigation period was advanced by seven days compared with last year. Many areas have expanded the area of winter irrigation because they have made more adequate preparations before winter irrigation, using various methods to develop water sources and use water rationally. Farmers in the first district of Dingxin County, Gansu Province, used the low-lying area of ​​the Great Buddha Temple to build a reservoir with a water storage capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, increasing the irrigation area by more than 13,000 mu. Fifteen of the twenty-two Qanat wells in Machang Township, Shanshan County, Xinjiang Province, have been repaired. The water volume of some of the repaired Qanat wells has increased by more than one time, ensuring the winter and spring water use of more than 11,000 mu of land in the township.

    西南西北各地农民积极争取今年农业增产
    据新华社讯：西南区农民正满怀信心地争取一九五四年农业生产的胜利。全区各地农民在互助合作组织带动下，展开了除虫、冬耕、积肥和兴修水利等工作。四川、贵州等省种植水稻地区农民大力防治螟虫。贵州省关岭、罗甸、施秉、都匀等县的许多农民积极铲烧稻根，扑灭虫卵、虫蛹。云南省曲靖、宜良等专区和西康省荥经、汉源、宝兴等县部分地区的小春作物发生麦蚜、红蜘蛛等虫害，经迅速防治，都已基本扑灭。在冬耕方面，四川省的冬水田一般已进行了二犁二耙，较好地区已三犁三耙；贵州、云南等省较中心地区农民，挖犁板田、冬土分别达百分之七十到九十。在积肥和兴修水利等方面，云南省农民为小春作物和春耕生产积的肥料，一般较往年同期增加百分之十以上。贵州省毕节县长石乡农民为增加粮食产量，积极修沟引水，可灌溉近八千亩地，以便把土变成田。全区各省都已分别订出一九五四年粮食和工业原料作物增产的任务。四川省决定在一九五三年增产的基础上，争取一九五四年再增产百分之六。
    西南区农民一九五三年在增产粮食和工业原料方面，都作了很大贡献。全区一九五三年粮食作物的种植面积、产量和单位面积产量，都完成了预订计划。粮食总产量较一九五二年增加了百分之七强。烤烟、茶叶和蚕茧等产量都有显著增加；棉花和油菜单位面积产量也有提高。在小春作物播种期间，四川、云南、贵州等省农民响应人民政府号召，又积极扩大了油料作物的种植面积。
   【新华社西安十一日电】西北各地农民受到总路线教育后，纷纷施行农田冬季灌溉，以保证今年的粮棉增产。据不完全统计，西北各省已经冬灌的农田达一千六百万亩以上。新疆、宁夏、青海三省和甘肃省河西走廊、陕西省北部已冬灌完毕，陕西省关中地区和甘肃省东南部正在紧张冬灌，陕西省南部冬灌工作也即将普遍展开。宁夏省平罗县莫如信农业生产合作社为争取今年生产更多的粮食和棉花卖给国家，特选出擅长冬灌技术的李耀珍领导冬灌组，及时浇灌好了三百三十多亩粮田和棉田。他们还带动全乡三十六个互助组和单干农民，顺利灌完六千一百多亩农田的冬水。甘肃省安西县农民认识到增产粮食对国家经济建设的重要意义后，普遍整修支渠和农渠，使全县十万零八千五百多亩水田全部灌上冬水，并使灌溉期较去年提早七天。许多地区由于在冬灌前都作了较充分的准备工作，利用各种方法开拓水源、合理用水，因而扩大了冬灌面积。甘肃省鼎新县第一区农民利用大佛寺洼地修成蓄水池，贮水二十万立方公尺，增加了灌溉面积一万三千多亩。新疆省鄯善县马场乡二十二道坎儿井已整修好十五道，有些整修后的坎儿井水量增加一倍多，保证了全乡一万一千多亩地的冬、春用水。
