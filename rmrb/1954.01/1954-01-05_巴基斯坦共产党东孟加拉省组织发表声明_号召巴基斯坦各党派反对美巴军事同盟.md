    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi: The East Bengal Provincial Organization of the Communist Party of Pakistan published a statement in the newspapers on December 23, 1953, calling on the Pakistani people to defend peace and national independence and to oppose the US-Pakistan military alliance.
    The statement said: "We understand what war will mean for us. We tasted war in 1943. At that time, three million of our compatriots died of starvation; our women were ravaged by foreign soldiers; farmers were driven from their land without compensation to build airports; our educational institutions were instantly turned into barracks; our temples were desecrated; the US-Pakistan military alliance will once again bring these disasters to our land.” The statement called on all Pakistani parties to "hold high the banner of national sovereignty and independence" and oppose the conclusion of a US-Pakistan military alliance.

    巴基斯坦共产党东孟加拉省组织发表声明
    号召巴基斯坦各党派反对美巴军事同盟
    【新华社讯】喀喇蚩消息：巴基斯坦共产党东孟加拉省组织于一九五三年十二月二十三日在报纸上发表声明，号召巴基斯坦人民保卫和平与民族独立，反对美巴军事同盟。
    声明说：“我们了解战争对于我们将意味着什么。我们在一九四三年时已尝到了战争的滋味。那时有三百万同胞死于饥饿；我们的妇女被外国军人蹂躏；为了建造机场而无代价地把农民从自己的土地上赶走；我们的教育机关瞬息间即被变为兵营；我们的寺院被糟塌；巴美军事同盟将再一次地把这些国家带到我们的土地上来。”声明号召巴基斯坦各党派“高举起国家主权和独立的旗帜”，反对缔结美巴军事同盟。
