　　The Experience of the Communist Party of China, Shijiazhuang Fengxing Cigarette Factory Main Branch, in Leading Propaganda Network Work
    The Propaganda Department of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The Communist Party of China's Shijiazhuang Fengxing Cigarette Factory Main Branch has consistently emphasized the leadership of propaganda network work for several years. It has cultivated a group of propaganda personnel, making propaganda workers an important bridge for the Party to connect with the masses. The fact that the Fengxing Cigarette Factory can consistently complete its tasks even when production is not entirely normal is largely due to the activities of the propaganda workers.

    In October 1950, when Shijiazhuang City began to focus on establishing propaganda networks, the Fengxing Cigarette Factory (which had not yet been divided into branches) was one of the key points in the city. At that time, the factory branch selected three worker propaganda workers according to the instructions of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee. Later, under the leadership of the Municipal Committee, the branch conscientiously led the propaganda network work, enabling the propaganda worker team to continue to develop. By the winter of 1953, there were 42 propaganda workers (excluding those who had been transferred due to work), including 29 Party members, 9 Youth League members, and 4 non-Party activists. The political consciousness and professional skills of the propaganda workers have been significantly improved, making them strong propaganda backbones. Over the years, the branch has strengthened the Party's propaganda work through the propaganda network organization, making propaganda work more systematic, regular, and specific. It has also cultivated a large number of propaganda experts. In various production and political movements, propaganda workers are active elements who can both speak and act. The branch relies on this force to deeply mobilize the masses and powerfully promote the development of various movements. Propaganda workers have also played a prominent role in uniting, educating, and transforming backward elements in production. For example, Gao Junge, a propaganda worker in the packaging room, when promoting the Zhang Shuyun work method in the 1952 Increase Production and Practice Economy Competition, started with Si Aini after analyzing the ideological situation of the group, helping her learn the Zhang Shuyun work method and rapidly increasing her output. Then, she used her experience to educate and motivate everyone. After the Zhang Shuyun work method was promoted, the output of the entire group increased by 240 boxes per hour, and it promoted the entire packaging room to learn the Zhang Shuyun work method. Because the propaganda workers were active and the propaganda was timely, the political atmosphere among the workers was strong, and everyone eagerly sought progress, actively participating in cultural, political, and current affairs studies. The calls of the factory leadership could quickly become the actual actions of the masses. For example, in May 1953, the leadership called for improving product quality, and the workers immediately responded, with all products meeting the specified quality indicators. In short, the role of the propaganda workers is very obvious in all aspects of work. Therefore, although this factory's production was not normal due to raw material problems, it was able to complete its production tasks on time. From 1950 to the end of 1952, they completed their tasks very well, and therefore won the Shijiazhuang City and Shijiazhuang Municipal Enterprise Administration and other three award flags and the title of Model Factory. The branch was rated as a model branch by the first and second Shijiazhuang City Model Propaganda Worker Representative Conferences for its achievements in leading propaganda network work and has maintained this honor.

    The development of the Fengxing Cigarette Factory Branch's propaganda network work has gone through many ideological struggles. When the propaganda network was first established, the branch emphasized that it was busy with work and "had no time," and doubted the necessity of establishing a propaganda network and whether worker propaganda workers could play a role. In early 1951, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a decision on establishing a propaganda network for the masses in the entire party. The branch committee members also participated in the propaganda work conference held by the Municipal Committee, and their thinking became clearer. They developed 12 more propaganda workers, but they still doubted the role of the propaganda workers. It was not until the city vigorously carried out the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea propaganda that the propaganda workers played a prominent role, improved the consciousness of the employees, and promoted production, that the branch eliminated its doubts and attached importance to and conscientiously led the propaganda work. Initially, there were still many ideological obstacles among administrative cadres. Some administrative cadres repeatedly hindered the establishment of a system for propaganda worker activities, saying: propaganda workers are all Party members and Youth League members, there is no need to establish any activity system. Some administrative cadres were also indifferent to the work of propaganda workers. In response to these problems, the branch repeatedly explained to them the significance and role of establishing a system, and finally overcame these ideological obstacles, making the entire factory attach importance to propaganda work.

    The Fengxing Cigarette Factory Branch has four characteristics in leading propaganda work:

    I. The branch attaches importance. This is a prerequisite for doing a good job in propaganda worker work, and it is also the most prominent point in the factory's propaganda work. The branch believes that the propaganda network organization is an important organization for the Party organization to rely on the masses to overcome bureaucracy and run enterprises well. Based on this understanding, the branch committee regards propaganda worker work as a regular task of the branch and pays special attention to the use and training of propaganda workers. In each period and each central task, the branch makes specific decisions on how propaganda workers should act and conveys them to each propaganda worker. The general branch secretary puts forward specific opinions on the propaganda work plan for each period and focuses on reading propaganda worker work diaries, listening to propaganda worker reports, and conducting individual conversations with propaganda workers. Branch committee members also frequently participate in propaganda worker activities and provide specific guidance. Comrade Wang Zhongnian, the former branch secretary and factory director of this factory, although busy with administrative work, always took time to lead propaganda worker work. Therefore, although they did not have a full-time propaganda cadre in the past, the propaganda work was still done very well.

    The Fengxing Cigarette Factory Branch pays special attention to cultivating new propaganda forces. Each propaganda worker takes a "disciple." Therefore, although many propaganda workers have been promoted or transferred, batches of new forces have been added to ensure the normal progress of propaganda work.

    II. The branch attaches importance to the ideological leadership of propaganda workers, frequently conducts ideological education for propaganda workers, organizes propaganda workers to study, and improves the ideological level and professional ability of propaganda workers. Propaganda workers must have three conditions to do a good job: have "capital" (propaganda materials), have enthusiasm, and have prestige. Therefore, the branch first established a propaganda worker study system, introducing books with educational significance to propaganda workers with reading ability, such as "Liu Hulan," "The Story of Zoya and Shura," and "Korean Correspondence." When films with great educational significance are shown, they organize or call on everyone to watch them. When necessary, the Party committee also assigns special personnel to give special reports to propaganda workers, such as the problem of planned management, etc. The branch also pays close attention to helping propaganda workers summarize their work experience or introduce work experience from various places to propaganda workers in order to improve the professional ability of propaganda workers. In order to establish the prestige of propaganda workers among the masses and understand the work results of propaganda workers, the branch frequently goes deep into the masses to collect reflections and uses the opinions reflected by the masses to educate propaganda workers. Under the care and training of the branch, propaganda workers have made rapid progress. Among the 27 worker cadres who have been promoted in the past, 21 were propaganda workers.

    III. The branch always adheres to the implementation of the propaganda worker activity system, ensuring the regularity and standardization of all propaganda worker activities. The propaganda worker activity system stipulates: one hour of activity time per week, mainly in the form of group activities, the content of which is evaluation, learning, reporting work, and exchanging experience; general meeting of all propaganda workers, the content of which is to summarize and deploy work or listen to reports; in addition, there are irregular joint meetings of propaganda worker group leaders, etc. These systems are all based on the requirements and actual needs of propaganda workers and have been supported by the administration and all parties. Each activity is led, prepared, short in time, and can solve problems, so propaganda workers can consciously and actively participate.

    IV. The administration, trade union, and Youth League actively support propaganda worker activities. First of all, the administrative side guarantees that it will not easily occupy the propaganda worker activity time, which is a great support for propaganda work. The cadres of the Youth League are all propaganda workers. The Youth League recommends Youth League members to the Party as propaganda workers through the organization, checks the work of Youth League member propaganda workers through the Youth League organization, and is also responsible for organizing Youth League member propaganda workers to study, etc., playing a real assistant role. This is also prominent in the Fengxing Cigarette Factory. The responsible comrades of the trade union also participated in the activities of propaganda workers, listened to the reflections of propaganda workers to improve their work, and also specifically helped propaganda workers in their work.

    The Fengxing Cigarette Factory Branch also has the following main specific leadership methods for propaganda workers:

    I. Evaluation. Through evaluation, the branch can understand the activities of propaganda workers, and can also urge propaganda workers to check their work, exchange experience, and promptly commend and encourage the progress of propaganda workers. The evaluation conditions should be based on the current central work and put forward different requirements each time. The branch should pay attention to overcoming the idea of ​​being troubled and the phenomenon of formalism in leading the evaluation work.

    II. Propaganda worker work diary. The content of the propaganda worker diary includes the ideological situation and opinions of the masses, their own work and ideological situation, propaganda work plan, propaganda effect, work experience and lessons, and opinions on the leadership, etc. The biggest advantage of keeping a diary is that it reduces many reporting meetings and helps the leadership to understand the work of propaganda workers in a timely manner. The branch should give instructions on the propaganda worker diary in order to improve the diary and encourage propaganda workers to write diaries. (Editor's note: The system of propaganda workers keeping diaries can be implemented in places where conditions permit, but the content of the diary should be as simple as possible to avoid excessively increasing the burden on propaganda workers).

    III. Spot check report. In order to understand the situation deeply and in a timely manner, the branch must also plan and purposefully designate propaganda workers to make reports, listen to their reflections or study problems, in order to guide the overall work.

    IV. Because there are many young workers in this factory, the branch pays attention to giving play to the role of the Youth League organization. The cadres of the Youth League are all propaganda workers and are the backbone of the propaganda workers. The branch can promote the Youth League branch to do some specific work, such as organizing propaganda workers to study, reading some propaganda worker diaries, and listening to general reports.

    V. For each period and each central task, the leadership's intentions should be clearly explained to the propaganda workers in advance, and clear and specific requirements should be put forward, and methods should be taught. Make the propaganda workers' direction of struggle clear and their strength concentrated. Attention should also be paid to inspection in the work, plus regular evaluations, which makes the propaganda worker work done with arrangements, inspections, and results.

　　中共石家庄市风行烟厂总厂支部领导宣传网工作的经验
    中共石家庄市委宣传部
    中共石家庄市风行烟厂总厂支部几年来一贯重视对宣传网工作的领导，培养了一批宣传力量，使宣传员成为党联系群众的重要桥梁，风行烟厂在生产不够正常的情况下，能够经常完成任务，宣传员的活动起了很大的作用。
    一九五○年十月，石家庄市开始重点建立宣传网时，风行烟厂（当时还没有分厂）是全市的重点之一，当时这个厂支部根据石家庄市委指示精神挑选了三名工人宣传员，以后，支部在市委领导下认真领导了宣传网工作，使宣传员队伍继续得到发展，到一九五三年冬已有四十二名宣传员（因工作已调走者不在内），其中党员二十九名、团员九名、非党积极分子四名。宣传员的政治觉悟、业务水平都有了显著提高，成了坚强的宣传骨干。几年来，支部通过宣传网组织加强了党的宣传工作，使宣传工作更系统、更经常、更具体化起来；并且培养了一大批宣传工作能手。宣传员在各个生产运动和政治运动中，都是能说又能干的活动分子，支部依靠这支力量深入发动群众，有力地推动了各种运动的开展。宣传员在团结教育生产中的落后分子方面也发挥了突出的作用。如包装室宣传员高俊阁，在一九五二年增产节约竞赛运动中推广张淑云工作法时，在分析了本组群众思想情况后，就从司爱妮着手，帮助她学会张淑云工作法，使她的产量迅速提高。然后，再用她的事实来教育和推动大家。张淑云工作法推广后，全组每小时增加产量二百四十盒，并推动了全包装室学习张淑云工作法。由于宣传员工作活跃，宣传及时，因而工人中间政治气氛浓厚，大家迫切要求进步，积极参加文化、政治、时事等学习。工厂领导方面的号召很快就能成为群众的实际行动。例如一九五三年五月领导方面号召提高产品质量，工人马上响应，所出的产品都达到了规定的质量指标。总之，宣传员的作用，在各项工作上都表现的很显明。所以这个厂虽然由于原料问题，生产不正常，但能够按时完成生产任务。从一九五○年到一九五二年底他们完成任务都很好，因而连得石家庄市和石家庄市企业管理局等三次奖旗和模范厂称号。支部因为领导宣传网工作有成绩，曾被石家庄市第一、二两届市级模范宣传员代表会议评为模范支部。并一直保持着这荣誉。
    风行烟厂支部宣传网工作的开展曾经经过了不少思想斗争。在刚建立宣传网时，支部强调工作忙，“没有时间”，对建立宣传网的必要性和工人宣传员能否起作用抱着怀疑态度。一九五一年初，中共中央发表了关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定，支部委员又参加了市委召开的宣传工作会议，思想就比较明确，又发展了十二名宣传员，但对宣传员的作用仍有怀疑。直到全市大张旗鼓进行抗美援朝宣传时，宣传员们发挥了突出的作用，提高了职工觉悟，推动了生产，支部才消除了怀疑，重视并认真领导宣传工作。行政干部中间起初还有许多思想障碍。有的行政干部曾一再阻碍建立宣传员活动制度，说：宣传员又都是党员、团员，不必再建立什么活动制度了。也有些行政干部对宣传员工作漠不关心。支部针对这些问题，反复向他们解释建立制度的意义和作用，终于克服了这些思想障碍，使全厂都重视宣传工作。
    风行烟厂支部在领导宣传工作上有四个特点：
    一、支部重视。这是做好宣传员工作的先决条件，也是这个厂宣传工作上最突出的一点。支部认为宣传网组织是党组织依靠群众克服官僚主义办好企业的重要组织，基于这种认识，支委会把宣传员工作当作支部经常工作，并特别注意对宣传员的使用和培养。在每个时期，每个中心工作中，支部对宣传员怎样活动都作出具体决定，并传达给每个宣传员。总支书记对每个时期的宣传工作计划都提出具体意见，并有重点地看宣传员工作日记，听宣传员汇报，对宣传员进行个别谈话等。支部委员也经常参加宣传员活动，给予具体指导。这个厂的前任支部书记兼厂长王中年同志，虽然行政工作忙，但总要抽出一定时间领导宣传员工作。所以过去他们虽然没有专职宣传干部，但宣传工作仍然做得很好。
    风行烟厂支部特别重视培养新的宣传力量。每个宣传员都带“徒弟”。因此，虽然有不少宣传员被提拔或调职，但是一批批的新生力量又补充上来，保证了宣传工作的正常进行。
    二、支部重视对宣传员的思想领导，经常对宣传员进行思想教育，组织宣传员学习，提高宣传员的思想水平和业务能力。宣传员要作好工作必须具备三个条件：有“资本”（宣传材料）、有热情、有威信。因此，支部首先建立了宣传员学习制度，向有阅读能力的宣传员介绍富有教育意义的书籍，如“刘胡兰”、“卓娅和舒拉的故事”及“朝鲜通讯”等。放映教育意义大的影片时，组织或号召大家去看。在必要时党委还指定专人向宣传员作专题报告，如计划管理问题等等。支部还很注意帮助宣传员总结自己的工作经验，或向宣传员介绍各地工作经验，以提高宣传员的业务能力。为了树立宣传员在群众中的威信和了解宣传员工作效果，支部经常深入群众搜集反映，用群众反映的意见再来教育宣传员。在支部这样关怀和培养下，宣传员都有很快的进步，在过去提拔的二十七名工人干部中就有二十一名是宣传员。
    三、支部始终坚持贯彻宣传员活动制度，保障了宣传员全部活动的经常和正规化。宣传员活动制度规定：每星期一小时活动时间，方式以小组活动为主，内容为评比、学习、汇报工作及交流经验；全体宣传员大会，内容为总结布置工作或听报告；此外还有不定期的宣传员小组长联席会等。这些制度都是根据宣传员要求和实际需要而定的，同时得到了行政及各方面的支持，每次活动都是有领导、有准备的，时间不长又能解决问题，因而宣传员都能自觉积极参加。
    四、行政、工会、青年团积极支持宣传员活动。首先是行政方面保证不轻易侵占宣传员活动时间，这对宣传工作就是很大的支持。青年团的干部都是宣传员，青年团通过组织向党推荐团员作宣传员，通过团的组织检查团员宣传员的工作，还负责组织团员宣传员进行学习等，发挥了真正的助手作用。这在风行烟厂也是突出的。工会负责同志也参加了宣传员的活动，听取宣传员反映改进自己的工作，同时，也具体帮助了宣传员工作。
    风行烟厂支部对宣传员还有以下几个主要的具体领导方法：
    一、评比。通过评比支部可以了解宣传员活动情况，也可促使宣传员自己检查工作，交流经验，及时表扬鼓励宣传员进步。每次评比时评比条件应根据当前中心工作提出不同的要求。支部在领导评比工作中应注意克服嫌麻烦的思想和形式主义的现象。
    二、宣传员工作日记。宣传员日记内容包括群众思想情况和意见、自己的工作和思想情况，宣传工作计划，宣传效果，工作经验教训以及对领导的意见等。记日记的最大好处，是减少了许多汇报会议，并帮助领导方面及时了解宣传员工作的情况。支部要对宣传员日记批示意见，以便改进日记和鼓励宣传员写日记的情绪。（编者按：宣传员写日记的制度，在有条件的地方可以实行，但日记内容应尽量简单，以免过分增加宣传员负担）。
    三、抽查汇报。为了深入、及时地了解情况，支部还必须有计划有目的的指定宣传员做汇报，听取他们的反映或研究问题，以指导全面工作。
    四、因为这个厂青年工人多，所以支部注意发挥青年团组织的作用。青年团的干部都是宣传员，并且都是宣传员中的骨干分子，支部可推动团支部去作一些具体工作，如组织宣传员学习，看一部分宣传员日记及听取一般的汇报等。
    五、每个时期，每个中心工作，都要事先向宣传员交代清楚领导意图，提出明确、具体的要求，并教给办法。使宣传员奋斗方向明确、力量集中。在工作中还注意检查，再加上定期的评比，这就使得宣传员工作做到有布置、有检查、有结果。
