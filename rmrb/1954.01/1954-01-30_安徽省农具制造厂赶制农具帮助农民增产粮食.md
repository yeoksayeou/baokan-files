The Anhui Provincial Farm Implement Factory
Rushes to Produce Farm Tools to Help Farmers Increase Grain Production

The Farm Implement Factory directly under the Anhui Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry is currently rushing to produce a large number of various waterwheels, rakes, harrows, hoes and other farm tools necessary for cultivating paddy fields, to help farmers in the Huaibei area convert dry land into paddy fields and increase grain production. Among them, the first batch of 3,700 ball-bearing hand-cranked waterwheels and pedal waterwheels, after completion, can irrigate 20,000 to 30,000 mu of land for farmers.

Converting dry land into paddy fields is one of the important contents of the production reform implemented in the areas along the Huai River in Anhui Province this year. This year, 300,000 mu of dry land in the area will be converted into paddy fields, and the output of paddy fields can be doubled compared with that of dry land. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
