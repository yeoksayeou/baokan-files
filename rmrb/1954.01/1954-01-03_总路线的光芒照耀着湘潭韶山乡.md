    The General Line’s Radiance Illuminates Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan
    Wen Qihuang
    On December 12th last year, the farmers of Shaoshan Township, the fourth district of Xiangtan County, Hunan Province—the hometown of Chairman Mao—completed a glorious task: they delivered more than 120,000 jin of surplus grain to the state granary.
    Acting as Patriotic Farmers Led by Chairman Mao
    The farmers of Shaoshan Township finished delivering their surplus grain to the state in just three days. On the first day of the delivery, the first to arrive at the state granary was Grandma He Ensheng, who was sixty years old. When she studied the general line for the transition period at the Fourth District People's Representative Conference, she guaranteed in front of more than 500 representatives that she would sell 800 jin of surplus grain to support national construction. After returning home, she also promoted the general line to many people. These days, she had been looking forward to the day of grain delivery. On the day the delivery began, before the rooster crowed for the third time, her family's meal was ready. When delivering the grain, she pulled the cart herself in the front, cheerfully along the way. She said to others: "In the old society, I had nothing to eat and nothing to wear, but now I have turned over thanks to Chairman Mao. My 5.4 mu of land yielded 20 shi and 2 dou of grain the year before last, 22 shi and 7 dou last year, and 25 shi and 2 dou last year because the cooperative supplied dried cakes and bone meal. I couldn't get enough to eat for more than fifty years before, but now that I'm sixty, I not only have enough to eat but also have surplus grain to sell to the state. As a patriotic farmer led by Chairman Mao, how can I not be happy!"
    "Acting as patriotic farmers led by Chairman Mao!" This is the common action slogan of the farmers of Shaoshan Township after studying the general line. In order to support national industrialization, farmers with surplus grain have sold their surplus grain to the state, and some farmers who have just enough grain to eat have also tried to save some grain to sell. Mao Fengtang is a single old man. When he sold his grain, he wrote a note to the working cadres, which read: "I, Fengtang, am over sixty years old, and I got land thanks to Chairman Mao. Now that the country is engaged in construction, I will also sell 50 jin of grain to express my intentions." Youth League member Yu Wenguang was a grain-deficient household last year. He said, "I will definitely work hard to produce next year and strive to increase grain production to sell to the state!"
    Yearning for a Socialist Society
    The farmers of Shaoshan Township selling 120,000 jin of surplus grain is a concrete manifestation of the increased patriotic and socialist consciousness after education on the general line. Mao Renqiu, secretary of the Shaoshan Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party, said excitedly to me: "The farmers of Shaoshan Township have broadened their horizons after studying the general line. Many farmers say that the more grain farmers sell, the more developed the industry and the richer the country." Communist Party member Mao Hanzhang used to be unwilling to sell surplus grain, but after studying the general line, he sold 2,300 jin of surplus grain. He thought: My father was a martyr who sacrificed his life for the cause of communism; I am a Communist Party member, and when I joined the Party, I swore to fight for the cause of communism to the end. Now that the country is transitioning to a socialist society, shouldn't I move forward? I turned over thanks to Chairman Mao and joined the mutual aid group, and my life has greatly improved. But if the country's industry is not developed, I will still be following behind the cow for decades, and I will not be able to live the happy life of Soviet farmers. He made up his mind to sell his surplus grain to the state and strive to live in a socialist society as soon as possible. He also publicized his ideological transformation to the masses. Middle peasant Mao Renfeng sold rice at a high price last spring. This time, he was educated on the two roads, realized that the capitalist road was the wrong road, sold all his surplus grain, and was determined to take the socialist road. After seeing pictures of tractors, young men and women challenged each other, saying, "Let's see who gets to ride a tractor first!" After studying the general line, the farmers of Shaoshan Township are determined to do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation, work hard to produce, actively support national industrial construction, and strive to transition to a socialist society as soon as possible.
      New Plans, New Ideals
    Now, the farmers of Shaoshan Township are all planning to expand production in a planned way. Many farmers have deposited the surplus money after selling grain into the state bank. Their opinion is: money cannot generate interest at home, but if it is put in the bank, it can be taken out this spring for production, earning interest and supporting national construction. The Su Fuquan mutual aid group did not carry out winter plowing and planting one winter because they hired bricklayers to burn kilns and do business the year before last, which affected production in the spring of last year. After studying the general line, they decided not to do business anymore and have now formulated a plan for winter fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy repairs, and firewood chopping, and are preparing to promote double-cropping rice on another 27 mu. Group leader Su Fuquan said: "The general line has consolidated our mutual aid group, and three other households have asked to join the group. We must work hard to run the mutual aid group well and strive to transform it into an agricultural production cooperative as soon as possible."

### 总路线的光芒照耀着湘潭韶山乡

    总路线的光芒照耀着湘潭韶山乡
    文启煌
    去年十二月十二日，毛主席故乡——湖南省湘潭县第四区韶山乡的农民完成了一项光荣的任务，他们把卖给国家的十二万斤余粮送入了国家粮库。
    作毛主席领导的爱国农民
    韶山乡农民卖给国家的余粮三天就送完了。在送粮的头一天，最先到达国家粮库的是六十岁的老婆婆贺恩生。她在第四区区人民代表会上学习国家过渡时期总路线的时候，就在五百多代表面前保证卖出八百斤余粮，支援国家建设。回家后，她还向许多人宣传了总路线。这些日子，她天天盼望着送粮的日子到来。开始送粮那天，公鸡还没有啼三遍，她家的饭就煮好了。送粮时，她自己拉着车子走在前头，一路上高高兴兴。她对别人说：“在旧社会，我没有吃没有穿，如今我靠了毛主席翻了身。五亩四分田，大前年收谷二十石二斗，前年收二十二石七斗，去年因为合作社供应了枯饼和骨粉，收了二十五石二斗。以前五十多年都吃不饱，现在六十岁了，不但吃得饱，还有余粮卖给国家。作个毛主席领导的爱国农民，我怎能不高兴呢！”
    “作毛主席领导的爱国农民！”这是韶山乡农民学过总路线后共同的行动口号。为了支持国家工业化，有余粮的农民纷纷把余粮卖给国家，有些粮食正够吃的农民也设法节约卖出一些粮食。毛凤堂是一个单身老汉，他卖粮时写了张条子给工作干部，上面写着：“我凤堂，年纪六十多，靠了毛主席分田分地。现在国家搞建设，我也卖五十斤粮，表表我的心意。”青年团员余文广去年是个缺粮户，他说：“我明年一定努力生产，争取增产粮食卖给国家！”
    向往着社会主义社会
    韶山乡农民卖出十二万斤余粮，是经过总路线教育后爱国主义觉悟和社会主义觉悟提高的具体表现。中共韶山乡支部书记毛仁秋兴奋地对我说：“韶山乡农民学过总路线把眼界都打开了。许多农民说，农民多卖粮，工业越发达，国家越富强。”共产党员毛汉章以前有余粮不肯卖，学习过总路线以后，卖出余粮二千三百斤。他想：我父亲是个烈士，是为共产主义事业奋斗牺牲的；我是个共产党员，入党时，宣誓要为共产主义事业奋斗到底。现在国家正在向社会主义社会过渡，难道我就不前进了吗？我靠了毛主席翻了身，参加了互助组，生活大大改善了。但是如果国家工业不发达，我再过几十年还是要跟在牛屁股后面转，苏联农民的幸福生活也过不到了。他下决心把余粮卖给国家，争取早日过社会主义社会的生活。他还将自己的思想认识转变经过向群众宣传。中农毛仁丰去年春天曾高价出卖稻谷，这次受到两条道路的教育，认识到资本主义道路是错误的道路，卖出了全部余粮，决心走社会主义道路。青年男女们看了拖拉机的图片后，彼此挑战说：“看我们谁先坐上拖拉机啊！”韶山乡农民学习了总路线以后，都决心搞好互助合作，努力生产，积极支持国家工业建设，争取早日过渡到社会主义社会。
      新的计划新的理想
    现在，韶山乡农民都盘算着有计划地扩大生产。许多农民把卖粮后的余款存入了国家银行。他们的意见是：钱放在家里不能生息，放在银行里，今春取出来搞生产，得了利息，还支持了国家建设。苏福全互助组前年因为请瓦匠烧窑做生意，一个冬天没有进行冬耕冬种，去年春上的生产也受了影响。学习了总路线，他们决定不再做生意，现在已订出冬季积肥、修水利和砍柴的计划，准备再推广双季稻二十七亩。组长苏福全说：“总路线巩固了我们的互助组，另外还有三户要求参加到组里来。我们要努力搞好互助组，争取早日转为农业生产合作社。”
