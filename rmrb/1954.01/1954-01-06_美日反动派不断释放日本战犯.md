Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th: To step up the rearmament of Japan, the US-Japanese reactionaries are continuously releasing important Japanese war criminals who harmed the people of Asia from prison, so that these militarists can wield their butcher knives again.

According to the Yoshida government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the US military authorities released Nobuyuki Abe, a Class A war criminal and former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Kwantung Army and Governor-General of Korea, and former Army General, on the 3rd. At the same time, the US-Japanese reactionaries are preparing to continue to release Class A war criminals, perpetrators of the invasion of China, Sadao Araki and Shunroku Hata and others.

Prior to this, fifty-two Japanese war criminals who committed rape, arson and murder in the Philippines during the war were also released from prison on December 30, 1953.

    美日反动派不断释放日本战犯
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：美日反动派为了加紧重新武装日本，正不断把残害亚洲人民的日本重要战犯释放出狱，以便使这些军国主义分子重操屠刀。
    据吉田政府外务省宣布：美军当局已于三日将战时曾任日本关东军司令官和朝鲜总督的甲级战犯、前陆军大将南次郎释放。同时，美日反动派正准备继续释放甲级战犯、侵华元凶荒木贞夫和畑俊六等人。
    在这以前，战时曾在菲律宾进行奸淫烧杀的五十二名日本战犯，也在一九五三年十二月三十日被释放出狱。
