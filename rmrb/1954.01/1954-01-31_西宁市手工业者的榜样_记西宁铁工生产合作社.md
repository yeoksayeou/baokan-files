　　The Model for Handicraft Workers in Xining City
　　——A Record of the Xining Ironworkers' Production Cooperative
　　By our correspondent　Li Gendi

　　The bitter winter wind has long since swept into Xining City, Qinghai Province. However, the entrance to the Xining Ironworkers' Production Cooperative is still crowded with people. They are all enthusiastic customers of this cooperative.

　　In the cooperative's courtyard, various iron tools are piled up: manure forks, iron hoes, sickles, as well as animal traps (for trapping wolves), pot supports, iron wedges (for pitching tents), and construction equipment. The furnace room constantly emits the sound of hammers clanging, and many people are busy in the courtyard. One small creaking cart loaded with farm tools has just left, and another has arrived. These new products are all to be sent to the countryside and the distant pastoral areas.

　　With the development of agriculture and animal husbandry production in Qinghai Province, the cooperative is also constantly expanding production. Xu Zengkui, the director of the cooperative's council, said: "In the past, how would we small handicraft workers dare to undertake such large orders! At that time, we lacked funds, we lacked manpower, and we even had to cook our own meals. We couldn't handle large orders, and small orders weren't enough to keep us going. Although we could sometimes earn a few dollars, we never escaped poverty. Especially when weddings or funerals came around, our meager savings were wiped out. After the establishment of the cooperative, we truly found the right path."

　　After a year of development, the Ironworkers' Production Cooperative has become like a shining star, illuminating the eyes of the handicraft workers in Xining City. The cooperative's production is getting better day by day. The cooperative members all understand that even when making a small iron nail, they consider its use to the herdsmen, and how much impact an iron hoe will have on farmers' production; every hammer blow, finding a trick to save half a catty of coal, has significance for the development prospects of the cooperative. They work with great enthusiasm, each trying to outdo the other. For example, when making manure forks for the farmers in Guide County, the original plan during discussions was for each furnace to produce more than ten manure forks per day, but after four or five days, Wang Xuan's furnace increased to more than twenty, and other furnaces caught up to seventeen or eighteen. Wang Xuan then created a record of thirty-two per day. Wang Zhande, although old, also wanted to compete, and his average output increased to thirty-one. When making sickles, the output of the furnace room increased from twelve to fourteen, and then to twenty. The lathe grinding wheel couldn't keep up, so the three members of the lathe group came up with a solution, changing the hand-cranked operation to a wheel driven by a motor, saving one person's labor and increasing output by one and a half times. Collective production encourages everyone to work hard to learn techniques. The master craftsman gives the pliers to the apprentice, while he himself wields the sledgehammer, teaching as he hammers. Through close cooperation between masters and apprentices over the past year, out of the cooperative's seventeen ordinary workers, five have been promoted to formal technicians, and nine have been promoted to semi-skilled workers. The speed of technical progress is much faster than in private iron shops. In the past, an apprentice could not be promoted to a technician even after several years. Everyone works together, with many people contributing their skills. The sickles made in the past were expensive and not easy to use. The members studied the problem and found that the blade was soft and the handle was set too low. After correcting these two shortcomings, the price of the sickles was 4,000 yuan cheaper than those sold in the market, and each sickle could cut forty more bundles of wheat. Due to the members' active labor, the collective wealth of the cooperative increased from 2.7 million yuan when it was founded in October of the year before last to 30.01 million yuan in October of last year. The cooperative is also planning to purchase universal lathes, blowers, electric drills, and other new tools. As production develops, the income of the members increases. The actual income of each member has increased by one-half to one times compared to when they were self-employed. Wang Xuyan, a member who has been working as an ironworker for twenty-seven years, deeply feels this amazing change. Twenty-seven years of blacksmithing did not guarantee his livelihood, but instead bankrupted him three times, leaving him with only a set of blacksmithing tools. After joining the cooperative, he will never encounter the kind of hardship he faced when working alone.

　　The Xining Ironworkers' Production Cooperative was established in October 1952. At that time, organizing twenty-five small handicraft workers (including workers and apprentices) was not an easy task. Some handicraft workers joined the cooperative empty-handed; some brought their tools, set up their furnaces, and worked with their former apprentices; some feared that the cooperative would collapse and kept their iron shops as a backup plan. The cooperative established six furnace groups, and the members and tools of four of these groups were simply moved in from the outside without any changes. Because the newly established two furnace groups did not have tools, they had to run around borrowing tools during production. There were also large disparities in the production conditions between the groups. Skilled workers could produce fourteen iron hoes a day, while less skilled workers could only produce seven, and even then there would be defective products. The cooperative's leaders lacked experience in the new organization, and the existence of the old ways led to chaos in production. The leadership tried to solve this problem by using blackboard newspapers, oral encouragement, and material rewards to commend members with good production, hoping to stimulate production enthusiasm, but the effect was not good. Later, one member came up with a good idea: "The groups have different manpower, how can we compare apples and oranges! Can't we just exchange manpower?" Most people in the cooperative agreed with this suggestion, although some grumbled about being reluctant to break up, they eventually agreed. In this way, the old system of small handicraft businesses began to disintegrate, and the manpower, tools, and other resources of each group became more balanced than before.

　　Although the technical adjustment met the requirements of enterprise production, the cooperative still had other problems. The defect rate was still very high, and many customers requested returns. The cooperative had accumulated 400 catties of defective products. One of the main reasons for the high defect rate was the members' erroneous thinking, believing that "What does it matter if ironwork is an inch longer or shorter? Close enough is good enough," and "If it's heavier, we can sell it for more scrap iron." Customers, seeing that the iron ropes made were clumsy and heavy, angrily questioned: "Are you selling iron or selling goods?" Another reason was that the cooperative's leaders were still following the old methods of managing production. When customers came to place orders, the cooperative did not have order forms, and simply scribbled the price, quantity, date, and other information of the goods in a diary, or relied on memory. Sometimes when customers came to pick up the goods, they found that the order had been forgotten; sometimes the things made were either too many or too few, too long or too short. When mistakes were made, you blamed me, and I blamed you, shifting responsibility and making it impossible to trace the cause. Everyone blamed each other, and the customers were also dissatisfied with the cooperative.

　　The Secretary of the Xining Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately spoke with Xu Zengkui, the head of the cooperative, explaining the importance of organizing handicraft workers, and also sent a working group to help with the work. A meeting of the cooperative members was immediately convened to discuss how to overcome the chaos in production. Everyone proposed that the cooperative should establish some new rules. Since customers ordered many items and varieties, it was necessary to print an order form; products should be inspected upon entering the warehouse. Criticism was also launched among the members. The cooperative leaders studied everyone's opinions, visited state-owned enterprises, and formulated improvement measures. Cost accounting was implemented, daily output targets were set for groups, and product acceptance and warehouse management systems were established, and technical research was organized. Xu Zengkui, the director of the cooperative, personally went to the suburbs to solicit farmers' opinions on sickles based on everyone's suggestions. After the implementation of the new system, the chaos in the production process quickly decreased, the defect rate also decreased, and the price of products was also reduced again and again. Customers praised: "The cooperative is, after all, a cooperative, and it is improving every day."

　　The initial order in production management created favorable conditions for the development of production capacity. However, the members' strong loose habits and ultra-egalitarianism hindered the progress of collective production. Even after the wake-up bell had rung, some people still did not get up. When the work bell rang, no one went to work. Some people who went to work did not produce quietly, but often fought and cursed. The cooperative had stipulated that taking temporary leave for personal or sick reasons for no more than three days would not result in a deduction in wages, so those who were sick took leave, and those who were not sick and had nothing to do did not want to "lose out" and also had to take three days off. After obtaining permission to take leave, they went to the theater or strolled through the streets. Some members even went to the movies in droves during production time. In one month, due to three members taking eight days of leave, the delivery date was delayed by four days, and the cooperative was penalized according to the contract. Under these circumstances, the development of the cooperative encountered great difficulties. The cooperative council again handed this matter over to all the members for discussion. During the discussion, the members realized that the attitude toward labor must be changed, and that if it was allowed to continue, it would cause the cooperative to collapse. During the discussion, everyone compared the past and the present. Shi Mingfa had been an apprentice in a private iron shop for four or five years and had never even held pliers, but after joining the cooperative for nine months, he rose from a rough worker to a technician, and his salary increased by more than three times. These memories greatly raised the members' awareness, recognizing that the cooperative was leading the members toward a happier socialist path, and that the incorrect attitude toward labor was like a bomb that would destroy their bright future. Everyone praised Wu Shengwu, a technician who actively worked and saved raw materials, criticized Shi Mingfa for being lazy, gave Ma Deshan, who repeatedly refused to change, a major demerit, and also established eight labor disciplines. From then on, the phenomenon of lax labor discipline decreased. Some members were reluctant to take leave even when they had minor illnesses. A conscious work ethic of mutual encouragement and mutual learning became the norm.

　　The Xining Ironworkers' Production Cooperative has grown up. Under the active leadership of the Xining Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the members are constantly overcoming the blindness, conservatism, sloppiness and other thoughts and habits of individual handicraft workers. Collectivist thinking is constantly growing, and the face of the cooperative is changing. It has become a model for the organization of handicraft workers in Xining City. When the cooperative was first established, some handicraft workers looked on with cold eyes. When the cooperative encountered difficulties, they sneered: "How about it, about to collapse, right? Too many people, too many opinions, how can it be as leisurely as working alone!" But now, many ironworkers are requesting to join the cooperative. Not only that, but handicraft workers in Xining City who are engaged in woodworking, sewing, shoemaking, and other trades are also running to the People's Government, asking for help in establishing cooperatives. They said: "We can no longer work alone."

　　西宁市手工业者的榜样
　　——记西宁铁工生产合作社
    本报记者　李根蒂
    严冬的寒风，早已刮进青海省西宁市了。但是，西宁铁工生产合作社的门口，仍然聚集着许多人。他们都是这个合作社热心的主顾。
    在合作社的院子里，堆积着各种铁器：有粪杈、铁铣、镰刀，也有夹脑（套狼用的）、锅撑、铁楔（扎帐篷用的），还有建筑器材。烘炉间不断地传出铁锤叮咚的响声，许多人在院子里忙碌着。一辆装满农具的咯吱咯吱的小车刚出去，另一辆又进来了。这些新产品都是要送到农村和远远的牧区去的。
    随着青海省农业、牧业生产的发展，合作社也不断地扩大生产。合作社理事会主任徐增魁说：“要是在以前，我们这些小手工业者，谁还敢承做这样大宗的活！那时，资金少，人手缺，连做饭烧锅也要自己动手。碰见大活啃不动，遇上小活不够搞。虽然有时能赚几个钱，但穷苦的日子总是过不完，特别是遇见红白事情一花销，老本都完了。成立合作社以后，真是摸到了明路。”
    铁工生产合作社经过一年的发展，已像一棵放光的明星，照亮了西宁市手工业者的眼睛。合作社的生产一天比一天好。合作社社员都知道就是打一个小铁钉子吧，他们也会想到对牧民要起什么作用，一张铁铣对于农民生产要发生多大影响；每打一锤，找一个窍门，省半斤炭，对于合作社的发展前途有多大的意义。他们干活的劲儿特别大，一个比着一个干。譬如给贵德县农民打粪杈，大家讨论时，原计划每个烘炉每日打十多张粪杈，可是，过了四、五日之后，王绪安烘炉上升到二十多张，别的烘炉赶到十七、八张。王绪安又创造了每日三十二张的记录，王占德虽然老了也要比一比，他的平均产量增加到三十一张。打镰刀时，烘炉间的产量由十二把增到十四把，又上升到二十把。车床沙轮磨不及，车床组三个组员想办法，把用手摇改为装轮带经过马达牵动，节省了一个人力，产量提高了一倍半。集体生产鼓舞着大家努力学习技术。师傅把钳子让给学徒，自己捉大锤，边打边指教。经过一年来师徒亲密的合作，全社十七个普通工人中，有五个上升为正式技工，有九个上升为半技术工人。技术进步的速度要比私营铁铺快得多了。过去一个徒工几年也不能升为技术工人。大家在一起干活，人多手艺高。过去做的镰刀，又贵又不好使，社员们一研究，发现刀子软、柄安得低。把这两个缺点改了之后，镰刀价钱比市上卖的贱四千元，每把镰刀又能多割四十捆麦子。由于社员们积极地劳动，合作社的集体财富，由前年十月创办时的二百七十万元增加到去年十月的三千零一十万元。合作社还计划着购置万能车床、鼓风炉、电钻等新式工具。生产发展了，社员的收入增加了。每个社员实际收入比个体经营时上升了二分之一到一倍。社员王绪安从事铁工二十七年，他深深地感到这个惊人的变化。二十七年的打铁生涯，没有使他的生活得到保障，反倒垮了三次，最后只剩下一套打铁的工具。入了社之后，他再也不会遇到单独劳动时那种苦境了。
    西宁铁工生产合作社是在一九五二年十月成立的。当时，要把二十五个小手工业者（包括工人、学徒）组织起来，却不是一件很容易的事。有的手工业者空着手来入社；有的带着工具，安上烘炉，还是同自己以前的学徒一块劳动；有的怕合作社垮台了，还把自己的铁铺保存着，留个后路。合作社成立了六个烘炉小组，四个小组的社员和工具都是原封未动由外边搬进来的。新成立的两个烘炉小组因为没有工具，生产时才东跑西转找工具。小组之间的生产状况也有很大悬殊，技术好的一天打十四张铁铣，技术差的打上七张还有废品。社的领导人员对新的组织缺乏经验，加上旧摊摊的存在，生产很混乱。领导方面试图解决这个问题，便用黑板报、口头和物质奖励的方法表扬生产好的社员，想刺激生产情绪，可是效果不好。后来，有个社员提了个好主意：“各组人手不同，鸡蛋怎能和石头碰呢！难道不能把人手调换调换？”合作社大部分人同意这个意见，虽然有些人还唧唧咕咕舍不得分散，以后也同意了。这样，小手工业的旧摊子开始瓦解了，每个小组的人力、工具等等，都比过去平衡了。
    技术调整虽然符合企业生产的要求，但是，合作社还有其他问题，废品率还很高，很多顾主纷纷要求退货。合作社曾积存了四百斤废品。产生废品多的一个原因，是社员思想上有个错误的想法，认为“铁活长一寸短一寸有啥关系？差不多就行了”，“打的重了还能多卖几个铁钱”。顾主看见打的铁绳又笨又重，气得质问：“究竟你们是卖铁，还是卖货哩？”另外一个原因，是合作社的领导人仍然沿袭手工业的老办法管理生产。顾主来订货，合作社没有订货单，把货物的价格、数量、日期等随便划在日记本上，或者凭着脑子记。有时顾主来要货，才发现忘了做；有时做出来的东西，不是多便是少，不是长便是短。出了错误，你怪我，我怪你，推来推去查不清责任。大家互相埋怨，顾主也不满意合作社了。
    中共西宁市委书记马上找社的负责人徐增魁谈话，说明手工业者组织起来的重要性，又派了工作组帮助工作，立即召集合作社社员开会，讨论怎样才能克服合作社生产上的混乱现象。大家提出合作社要订出些新制度。顾主订货项目多、品种杂，需要印个订货单；产品入库要验收。社员之间也展开了批评。合作社的领导人研究了大家的意见，参观了公营企业，制订了改进办法。实行成本核算，规定小组日产指标，建立产品验收及仓库管理制度，组织技术研究。合作社主任徐增魁根据大家意见，亲自到郊区征求农民对镰刀的意见。实行新制度后，生产过程中的紊乱现象很快减少了，废品率也降低了，产品价格也一再减低。顾客赞扬说：“合作社毕竟是合作社，天天在改进。”
    生产管理有了初步秩序，给生产能力的发挥创造了有利的条件。可是，社员们有浓厚的散漫习惯和极端平均主义的思想，阻碍着集体生产的前进。已经打过起床铃了，还有人不起来。上班铃打了，没有人上班。有人上了班不安静生产，时常打架骂人。合作社曾规定请临时事假、病假不超过三天不扣工资，于是有病的请假，无病无事的不愿“吃亏”，也得请三天假。请准假后，他们就进戏院，逛街道。有的社员在生产时间竟成群结队去看电影。有一个月，由于三个社员请了八天假，以致推迟了交货日期四天，按合同，合作社受到了处罚。在这种情况下，合作社的发展又遭到了极大的困难。合作社理事会把这事又交给全体社员讨论。讨论中，社员们认识到劳动态度必须改变，如果让它发展下去，会使合作社垮台的。在讨论中，大家都对比了过去和现在。史明发在私营铁铺当了四、五年学徒，连钳子都没捉过，入社九个月就由粗工上升到技工，工资比以前增加了三倍还多。这些回忆大大提高了社员的觉悟，认识到合作社正领导着社员往更幸福的社会主义大道走，不正确的劳动态度却像炸弹一样，会把他们的光明前途炸毁的。大家表扬了积极劳动、节省原料的技工吴生五，批评了偷懒的史明发，给屡劝不改的马德山记了一个大过，还订出了八条劳动纪律。从此以后，劳动纪律松弛的现象减少了。有的社员害了小病也不愿请假。互相鼓励、互相学习的自觉劳动成了风气。
    西宁铁工生产合作社成长起来了。在中共西宁市委积极领导下，社员们不断地克服着个体手工业者的盲目、保守、散漫等思想和习惯。集体主义的思想不断增长，合作社的面貌正在改变。它已成为西宁市手工业者组织起来的榜样。合作社刚成立的时候，有些手工业者冷眼旁观。当合作社遭受困难的时候，他们又冷言冷语：“怎么样，快垮了吧？人多舌头长，哪有单干清闲！”可是，现在，许多铁工正在请求加入合作社。不但这样，西宁市的木工、缝纫、制鞋等手工业者也跑去找人民政府，请求帮助他们成立合作社。他们说：“我们不能再单干下去了。”
