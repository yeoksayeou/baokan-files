Shanxi Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative Writes Letter to Workers Nationwide
Guaranteeing to Support Industrial Construction with Grain and Cotton

To our worker elder brothers nationwide:

Recently, connecting our cooperative's production situation, we studied the general line of the state during the transition period. Every member clearly recognizes that our ability to live a prosperous life is inseparable from your support.

Since our cooperative was formally established, relying on the waterwheels you manufactured, we have transformed 306 mu of nominally irrigated land that could only be watered once in the spring into regularly irrigated paddy fields; relying on the pesticides and sprayers you manufactured, we have basically defeated the four cotton pests, so the crops have all increased in production.

Our cooperative only has two main crops: wheat and cotton. Before the war, our land could only produce 90 jin of wheat per mu and 150 jin of seed cotton per mu. After liberation, in 1951, the whole cooperative averaged 110 jin of wheat per mu and 278 jin of seed cotton per mu. In 1952, wheat production decreased, averaging 77 jin per mu, and seed cotton averaged 370 jin and 9 liang per mu. In 1953, each mu of wheat produced 174 jin and 13 liang, exceeding the average yield of local masses by 24 jin and 13 liang, exceeding the average yield of our own unit by 49 jin and 13 liang. Although cotton production decreased due to the four pest infestations, each mu of cotton still averaged 360 jin and 8 liang, still exceeding the average yield of local masses by 157 jin and 8 liang.

From the autumn distribution perspective, the total income of seed cotton and autumn miscellaneous grains (including peanuts) in the whole cooperative was valued at 412,428,120 yuan. After deducting all investments and public accumulation funds, each labor day can be divided into an average of 22,000 yuan, equivalent to 26 jin and 3 liang of millet; each share of land can be divided into 749,260 yuan, equivalent to 892 jin of millet. Except for Chen Zhengyan's family, who had five children and owed a lot of foreign debt before joining the cooperative, making their life relatively difficult, the rest of the cooperative members can eat the grain they were given for two years, and wear fine cloth. Of the 53 households in the cooperative, there are 75 pairs of rain shoes and 40 flashlights.

Looking back, our prosperous life is because Chairman Mao guided us to take the road of organizing and becoming prosperous together, and also thanks to the worker elder brothers for manufacturing new farm tools for us, which greatly increased the harvest and made our lives prosperous. This proves that our peasants can never leave the worker elder brothers if we want to live happily in the future.

Therefore, at the meeting to discuss the general line of the state during the transition period, all our members sincerely guarantee to support you. We sold 26,053 jin of wheat to the state, accounting for 27.5 percent of the total wheat season distribution of the cooperative members. Our cooperative's autumn fields are mainly cotton. We guarantee to dry it in the sun, pick it clean, classify it, and sell it to the state in a timely manner, so that the machines can be fed and create greater happiness for us.

    山西吴春安农业生产合作社给全国工人写信
    保证用粮食棉花支援工业建设
    全国工人老大哥们：
    最近，我们联系我社的生产情况，学习了国家过渡时期的总路线。每个社员都明确认识到，我们能过上富裕的生活，是和你们的支援分不开的。
    我社正式建社以来，靠了你们造出来的水车，把三百零六亩只能春浇一次的挂名水地，变成了经常能浇水的水田；靠了你们造出来的农药、喷雾器，基本上战胜了棉花的四次虫害，所以庄稼都增产了。
    我社只有小麦、棉花两种主要作物。在战前，我们这些地每亩小麦只能产九十斤，每亩棉花只能产籽棉一百五十斤。解放后，一九五一年全社平均每亩小麦产了一百一十斤，每亩棉花产了籽棉二百七十八斤。一九五二年小麦减产，每亩平均产了七十七斤，每亩棉花产籽棉三百七十斤九两。一九五三年每亩小麦产一百七十四斤十三两，超过当地群众每亩平均产量二十四斤十三两，超过本单位常年平均产量四十九斤十三两。棉花虽因遭受四次虫害而减产，每亩棉花仍平均产了三百六十斤八两，仍超过当地群众每亩平均产量一百五十七斤八两。
    从秋季分红上来看，全社籽棉、秋季杂粮（连花生在内）收入共计折价四亿一千二百四十二万八千一百二十元。扣除一切投资、公积金，每个劳动日平均可分二万二千元，折小米二十六斤三两；土地每股可分七十四万九千二百六十元，折小米八百九十二斤。全社社员现除陈正言一户，因有五个孩子，入社前欠有外债很多，生活较困难外，其余社员分到的粮食大都能吃二年，穿的都是细布。全社五十三户，就有七十五双雨球鞋，手电筒四十个。
    回忆起来，我们这种富裕的生活，是因为毛主席指引我们走了组织起来大家富裕的道路，也多亏了工人老大哥给我们制造了新式农具，才大大地提高了收获量，生活富裕起来。这证明，我们农民今后要过得幸福，绝不能离开工人老大哥。
    因此，我们全体社员，在讨论国家过渡时期总路线的会议上，衷心保证要支援你们，我们卖给国家小麦二万六千零五十三斤，占社员麦季分红总数百分之二十七点五。我社的秋田主要是棉花。我们保证把它晒干拣净，分清等级，及时卖给国家，让机器吃饱，给我们创造更大的幸福。
              山西翼城县西梁村吴春安
                农业生产合作社全体社员
