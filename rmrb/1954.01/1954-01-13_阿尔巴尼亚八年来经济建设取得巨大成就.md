Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 12th: A dispatch from Tirana: January 11th marks the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Albania. The Albanian people have achieved great success in all aspects of national economic construction over the past eight years.

In 1953, Albania's total industrial output increased eightfold compared to 1938, with food industry production increasing tenfold, electricity increasing twenty-fourfold, cotton textiles increasing twentyfold, and mining industry production increasing four and a half times. The socialist component of the national economy is constantly growing. According to figures released by the Albanian Ministry of Finance, in 1953, income from the socialist component increased by 744 percent compared to 1946. During this period, appropriations for the national economy increased 11.5 times, and appropriations for social and cultural undertakings increased 5.7 times.

In agriculture, the sown area in 1953 increased by 64 percent compared to 1938. Thanks to the large supply of agricultural machinery from industry, the degree of mechanization in agriculture in 1953 increased by 20 percent compared to 1952, and the amount of work completed by machines increased fourfold compared to 1946. In the past year, national agricultural loans increased by 16.8 percent compared to 1952, more than ten times that of 1947. The government's assistance to farmers in terms of seeds, chemical fertilizers, and technology has also greatly increased. The socialist components in agriculture—agricultural production cooperatives, machine tractor stations, and state farms—have all developed considerably. Due to the improvement of agricultural technology and the widespread adoption of advanced Soviet experience, various grains and industrial crops achieved universal bumper harvests in 1953. The yield of wheat per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) increased by 250 kilograms compared to 1952, rye increased by 203 kilograms, barley increased by more than 300 kilograms, and oats increased by 200 kilograms. The total output of wheat and rye exceeded the annual production plan by 7 percent and 20 percent, respectively. According to incomplete statistics from the Albanian Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the total output of cotton increased by about 19 percent, and sugar beets and tobacco increased by about 50 percent and 75 percent, respectively.

The Albanian people have also made great progress in culture. Albania now has 2,118 primary schools, 305 junior high schools, and 28 senior high schools; before the war, it only had 643 primary schools and 11 secondary schools. The material conditions of the working people are also constantly improving. In 1952, the national consumption of sugar increased 2.4 times compared to 1948, meat and fish almost doubled, macaroni increased 3.5 times, and beans and rice almost increased sixfold.

In the past nine years, the population of Albania has increased by 280,000.

    在农业方面，一九五三年的播种面积比一九三八年增加了百分之六十四。由于工业供应大量农业机器，一九五三年农业的机械化程度比一九五二年提高了百分之二十，由机器完成的工作量增为一九四六年的四倍。过去一年国家的农业贷款比一九五二年增加了百分之十六点八，为一九四七年的十倍以上。政府在种子、化学肥料、技术等方面对农民的帮助也大大增加了。农业中的社会主义成分——农业生产合作社、机器拖拉机站和国营农场都有了相当大的发展。由于农业技术水平的提高和苏联先进经验的广泛采用，一九五三年各种粮食和工业作物得到普遍的丰收。小麦每公顷（合十五市亩）的产量比一九五二年增加了二百五十公斤，裸麦增加了二百零三公斤，大麦增加了三百多公斤，燕麦增加了二百公斤。小麦和裸麦的总产量分别超过全年生产计划百分之七和百分之二十。根据阿尔巴尼亚农业和采购部的不完全统计，棉花总产量约增加了百分之十九，甜菜和烟草约分别增加了百分之五十和七十五。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在文化方面也取得了巨大的进展。阿尔巴尼亚现在有二千一百一十八个初等学校，三百零五个初级中学，二十八个高级中学；而在战前，它只有六百四十三个初等学校和十一个中等学校。劳动人民的物质状况也不断改善了。一九五二年全国糖的消费量增为一九四八年的二点四倍，肉和鱼差不多增为两倍，通心粉增为三点五倍，豆类和大米差不多增为六倍。
