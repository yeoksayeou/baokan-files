Xinhua News Agency Report: On the eve of the New Year, the people of the whole country wrote tens of millions of warm letters of condolence to their loved ones far away in Korea – the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army – to congratulate them on the New Year.

    People from all over the country, filled with boundless gratitude and love, congratulated the commanders and combatants of the Volunteer Army on the great victories they had achieved in the past year's struggle. People from all walks of life in Shenyang and many famous model workers wrote more than 26,000 letters of condolence to the Volunteer Army. Zheng Xikun, a national railway labor model currently studying at the Workers and Peasants Rapid Course Middle School attached to the Northeast Institute of Technology, wrote in his letter: "The fact that we can sit quietly and listen to lectures in this beautiful building today is inseparable from the brilliant victories you have achieved on the front lines." He assured the Volunteer Army comrades that he would strive to achieve a score of five in every subject.

    Filled with boundless confidence and joy in the cause of socialist construction, the people of all regions reported to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea the achievements of the motherland's great construction over the past year and the even more beautiful prospects for the New Year, which is a characteristic of this year's large number of letters of condolence. The workers of the famous state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant's Liu Changfu group wrote to Zhang Xianmin, a combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, on December 30th: When you came to visit, our rolling mill was semi-automatic, but in 1954 we will change it into a fully automatic factory. They also said: A year ago, our production tasks were heavy. But we must strive to complete the annual production increase and savings plan 32 hours ahead of schedule – that is, tonight – as a New Year's gift to the Volunteer Army comrades.

    Many workers, students, and folk art workers in Beijing and Wuhan also described the achievements of construction and the improvement of people's lives in their hometowns in their New Year's greetings to the Volunteer Army. Many students in Beijing also carefully sent Chairman Mao's embroidered portrait to the Volunteer Army comrades. People from all over Fujian Province sent more than 11,000 greeting letters. Students from the province's schools for children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers also made many exquisite New Year cards to send to the front lines in Korea.

    全国人民寄出千万封慰问信
    向志愿军祝贺新年
    据新华社讯：新年前夕，全国人民写了千万封热情洋溢的慰问信向远在朝鲜的亲人——中国人民志愿军祝贺新年。
    各地人民怀着无限感激和爱戴的心情，祝贺志愿军指挥员和战斗员们在过去一年的斗争中取得的伟大胜利。沈阳市各界人民和许多著名的劳动模范给志愿军写了二万六千多封慰问信。现在东北工学院附设工农速成中学学习的全国铁路劳动模范郑锡坤的信上写着：“我们今天能够在这漂亮的楼房里安静地听课，是和您们在前线取得的辉煌胜利分不开的。”他向志愿军同志保证，一定要争取每门功课的成绩都达到五分。
    各地人民满怀着对社会主义建设事业无限的信心和喜悦，向在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军报告一年来祖国伟大建设的成就和对新的一年的更为美好的展望，是今年大批慰问信中的特点。著名的国营天津钢厂刘长福小组的工人们，在十二月三十日在给中国人民志愿军战斗英雄张宪民的信上写道：你来参观的时候，我们的轧钢厂是半自动化的，可是到一九五四年就要把它改变成一个全部自动化的工厂了。他们又说：一年前我们的生产任务是繁重的。但我们一定争取提前三十二小时——就是在今天晚上，完成全年增产节约计划，作为向志愿军同志们祝贺新年的贺礼。
    北京和武汉市的许多工人、学生、曲艺工作者在向志愿军贺年的信上也描述了自己家乡建设的成就和人民生活的改善。北京市的许多学生还把毛主席的绣像慎重地寄给志愿军同志。福建省各地人民寄出一万一千多封贺信。该省烈军属子弟学校学生，并制作了许多精美的贺年片寄到朝鲜前线去。
