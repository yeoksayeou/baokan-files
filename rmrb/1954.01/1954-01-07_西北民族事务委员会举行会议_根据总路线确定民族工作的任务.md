Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 6th: The first (enlarged) meeting of the Northwest Administrative Committee's Nationalities Affairs Committee was held from December 18th to 24th, 1953. Attending the meeting were members of the Northwest Administrative Committee's Nationalities Affairs Committee, chairmen and vice-chairmen of ethnic autonomous regions at or above the county level in Northwest China, representatives of various ethnic groups, ethnic affairs workers from various provinces (cities), and representatives from relevant organs in the Northwest Region, totaling more than 130 people, including representatives from twelve ethnic groups such as Han, Uyghur, Hui, Tibetan, Kazakh, Mongolian, Dongxiang, Salar, Tu, Kirgiz, Uzbek, and Yugur.

This meeting conveyed the spirit of the Third (Enlarged) Meeting of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, summarized the past nationalities work in the Northwest region, and, based on the spirit of the general line and general task during the national transition period, combined with the specific conditions of the Northwest ethnic areas, put forward the main tasks of nationalities work in the Northwest in the future. During the meeting, Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Administrative Committee, made a report on "The Current International Situation and the Economic Construction of the Motherland," and Wang Feng, Director of the Nationalities Affairs Committee of the Northwest Administrative Committee, made a report on "Northwest Nationalities Unite Further and Advance Under the Illumination of the General Line in the Transition Period." Wang Feng first summarized the achievements of nationalities work in the Northwest over the past four years. He pointed out that over the past four years, on the basis of national unity and social order, 34 ethnic autonomous areas have been established in the Northwest region, including 16 ethnic autonomous areas above the county level. More than 40,000 minority cadres have been trained. Land reform has been completed in the minority agricultural areas with nearly five million people; agricultural and animal husbandry production has been restored and developed, so that agricultural production has generally reached the highest level before the war; animal husbandry production has generally increased by more than 20% compared with 1949, and the material and cultural lives of all ethnic groups have been initially improved. Next, Wang Feng explained in detail the general line of the national transition period and its benefits to all ethnic groups, and put forward the main tasks of the current nationalities work in the Northwest: First, further promote ethnic regional autonomy, give full play to the effectiveness of regional autonomous governments, and make the autonomous organs of various ethnic autonomous areas the most popular governments among all ethnic groups. Second, help all ethnic minorities develop production. At present, in agricultural areas, educating farmers to organize mutual aid and cooperation should be placed in the primary position; in pastoral areas, adhere to the policy of "no struggle, no division, no class demarcation" and "benefit both herdsmen and herd owners", improve livestock breeding and grazing methods, rationally protect and use grasslands, help poor herdsmen settle down and produce, and advocate temporary and seasonal cooperation and mutual assistance on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Third, continue to carry out trade, medical, cultural and educational work, develop transportation, and strengthen the supply of means of production and means of livelihood to various minority areas. Fourth, vigorously train minority cadres, and plan to train a number of professional and technical personnel (especially junior technicians). Fifth, further consolidate national unity and social order, and be highly vigilant against the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements from the enemy. For various disputes between and within ethnic groups, in the spirit of national equality and unity, rational mediation should be carried out separately through democratic consultation under the conditions conducive to production.

The participating representatives unanimously agreed with Wang Feng's report and unanimously stated that they would further strengthen national unity, vigorously promote ethnic regional autonomy, and actively develop animal husbandry and agricultural production, so as to better cooperate with the country's economic construction and strive for a gradual transition to socialism.

At the closing meeting, Ma Mingfang, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Administrative Committee, gave important instructions. Ma Mingfang clarified the important significance of national unity and cooperation, and pointed out that all work should advance on the basis of developing production. Otherwise, other work will lose its content and become "trees without roots" and "water without a source". Finally, he called on cadres of all ethnic groups in the Northwest and leaders who have contact with the masses to continue to maintain the style of hard struggle and strive to do a good job in the work of minority areas in 1954.

    西北民族事务委员会举行会议
    根据总路线确定民族工作的任务
    【新华社西安六日电】西北行政委员会民族事务委员会第一次（扩大）会议于一九五三年十二月十八日到二十四日举行。出席会议的有西北行政委员会民族事务委员会委员、西北各地县级以上民族自治区主席、副主席，各民族的代表人士，各省（市）民族工作者以及西北区各有关机关的代表共一百三十余人，其中包括汉、维吾尔、回、藏、哈萨克、蒙古、东乡、撒拉、土、柯尔克兹、乌兹别克、裕固等十二个民族的代表。
    这次会议传达了中央人民政府民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议的精神，总结了过去西北地区的民族工作，并依据国家过渡时期的总路线、总任务的精神，结合西北民族地区的具体情况，提出了今后西北民族工作的主要任务。会议期间，西北行政委员会副主席张治中作了“关于目前国际形势和祖国经济建设”的报告，西北行政委员会民族事务委员会主任委员汪锋作了“西北各民族更进一步团结起来，在过渡时期总路线的照耀下前进”的报告。汪锋首先总结了四年来西北民族工作的成绩。他指出：四年来，西北地区在民族团结和社会秩序安定的基础上，建立了三十四个民族自治区，其中县级以上的民族自治区即成立了十六个。培养了四万多名少数民族干部。并在近五百万人口的少数民族农业区完成了土地改革；恢复并发展了农、牧业生产，使农业生产一般地达到了战前的最高水平；畜牧业生产一般也比一九四九年提高了百分之二十以上，初步改善了各族人民的物质生活和文化生活。接着，汪锋详尽地阐释了国家过渡时期的总路线和对各族人民的好处，并提出了当前西北民族工作的主要任务是：一、进一步推行民族区域自治，充分发挥区域自治政权的效能，使各民族自治区的自治机关成为各族人民最喜欢的政权。二、帮助各少数民族发展生产，目前在农业区应将教育农民组织互助合作放在首要地位；在牧业区仍然坚持“不斗不分、不划阶级”与“牧工、牧主两利”政策，改良牲畜饲养和放牧方法，合理保护与使用草原，帮助贫苦牧民安家生产，并在自愿互利的原则下，提倡临时性、季节性的合作互助。三、继续开展贸易、医疗、文教工作，发展交通运输事业，加强对各少数民族地区生产资料和生活资料的供应。四、大力培养少数民族干部，有计划地培养一批专业技术人才（首先是初级技术人员）。五、更进一步巩固民族团结和社会治安，严加警惕来自敌人方面的反革命分子的破坏活动。对于各民族间和民族内部的各种纠纷，应当本着民族平等团结精神，在有利于生产的条件下，采取民主协商的方式，分别予以合理调处。
    与会代表一致同意汪锋的报告。并一致表示：要更进一步加强民族团结，大力推行民族区域自治，积极地发展畜牧业和农业生产，以便更好地配合祖国的经济建设，为逐步过渡到社会主义而努力奋斗。
    在闭幕会上，西北行政委员会副主席马明方作了重要指示。马明方阐明了民族团结合作的重要意义，并指出：一切工作都要在发展生产的基础上前进，否则，其他工作就失掉了内容，都成了“无本之木”、“无源之水”。最后，他号召西北各族干部及与群众有联系的领袖人物，应继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风，为做好一九五四年少数民族地区的工作而努力。
