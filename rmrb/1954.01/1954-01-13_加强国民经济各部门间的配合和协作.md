    Strengthening Coordination and Collaboration Among All Sectors of the National Economy
    With the large-scale development of national construction, our economic affairs are also increasing day by day. In order to handle various economic affairs in an orderly manner, it is entirely necessary for all sectors of the national economy to implement a detailed division of labor and establish a dedicated responsibility system. Without such a system of division of labor and dedicated responsibility, various economic affairs cannot be handled correctly in a timely manner, which will affect or even harm the country's construction undertakings, this is without doubt. However, some cadres, even leading cadres, mistakenly understand this division of labor and dedicated responsibility to mean that they can do their own thing, act independently, and carry out their work in isolation; they do not pay attention to or are even unwilling to cooperate and collaborate with other departments in their work, treating requests from other departments for cooperation and collaboration as "trouble" and an "extra burden," which is wrong.
    Such isolated and independent thinking and practices are relatively common in our actual work. It affects the progress of national construction undertakings and, in some respects, has caused some harm. For example, some newly built and expanded enterprises have delayed the design or construction period due to the lack of close cooperation from other departments in terms of geology, equipment, materials, and transportation, making it impossible to determine the design task book; some production plants and mines cannot fully utilize the effectiveness of their equipment or even have to stop work and reduce production due to the lack of cooperation from other departments in terms of raw material supply and product sales, so that those products urgently needed by the country and the people cannot be fully supplied; geological surveys, data collection, and design work for some basic construction projects are often duplicated, wasting manpower and financial resources, because they are not carried out in a collaborative manner, and the task cannot be completed well due to the dispersed use of technical forces.
    From the perspective of the entire national economy, there are still many problems in terms of coordination and collaboration between industry and agriculture, between industrial and agricultural production and commodity circulation and transportation, and between economic construction and other construction projects. Within industry, there are also frequent problems of lack of cooperation or poor cooperation between the mining industry and the processing industry, or between one mining industry and another, or between one processing industry and another. Moreover, whether it is in various sectors of the national economy or within industry, there are many problems of coordination and collaboration in terms of long-term planning and current deployment, state-owned and private sectors, central economic departments and local economic departments, and so on. Even within a department's various professional bureaus, a factory or mine's various workshops (mine mouths), a workshop's various work sections, or a company, a store, or a railway section's internal units, there is a phenomenon of insufficient cooperation. Those loopholes and shortcomings that have occurred in our country's construction undertakings, although each has its direct and indirect causes, and the common cause lies in our lack of construction experience, the lack of coordination and collaboration in work is often an important reason for the formation of some loopholes and shortcomings.
    Division of labor and dedicated responsibility and collaboration and cooperation are originally unified, not opposed. The idea and practice that one can do without collaboration and cooperation with division of labor and dedicated responsibility is actually a manifestation of one-sidedness in ideological methods and a lack of overall concept and overall perspective. Because the idea and practice of not wanting to cooperate or being unwilling to cooperate mainly starts from the local requirements of one's own department or unit. Only seeing the part and ignoring the whole; only seeing the needs of one's own department and ignoring the needs of other departments often leads to fear of trouble when other departments ask one's own department to cooperate. In fact, if other departments do not have the cooperation of one's own department, it is certainly difficult to do a good job, but how can one's own department do a good job without the cooperation of other departments? For example, it is obvious that the smelting industry cannot produce without the mechanical industry supplying a large amount of equipment and the fuel industry supplying a large amount of electricity and coal; and the mechanical industry cannot manufacture the equipment needed by various departments without the smelting industry supplying a large amount of steel and other metal raw materials. Marx said long ago: "In production, men not only act on nature but also on one another. They produce only by cooperating in a certain way and mutually exchanging their activities. In order to produce, they enter into definite connections and relations with one another and only within these social connections and relations does their relation to nature, does production, take place." ("Marx and Engels Collected Works," Volume 5). Comrade Stalin also said: "Production is always and under all conditions social production." ("Dialectical and Historical Materialism"). The social connections and relations of production mentioned by Marx and Stalin are manifested as class relations on the one hand and as connections between various economies on the other hand in class society; in a society where the relationship of exploitation and being exploited has been eliminated (such as the Soviet Union), or in the economic field of a socialist nature (such as the state-owned economy of our country and various people's democratic countries), it is only manifested as the connection between various economies. This connection becomes more complex and closer with the increasing development of industry, which requires us to further cooperate, collaborate, and serve each other in our work.
    The unwillingness to collaborate that exists in some comrades or some departments is essentially a reflection of the characteristics of small producers such as decentralization and isolation in ideology and work style, which is fundamentally incompatible with the overall thinking and collectivist spirit unique to the working class. Even in the past rural work environment, in the case of decentralized and independent operations, our work was carried out under the unified leadership, unified command, and guidance of unified policies, and it also required cooperation and collaboration in the work. After the liberation of the whole country, we came into contact with large-scale modern industrial production and very complex economic affairs. Even in the countryside, its connection with the city has undergone profound changes, which requires a higher degree of cooperation and collaboration. If there is no cooperation or collaboration, it will cause greater losses and greater harm. Chairman Mao taught us in "On Practice": "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to achieve the results they expect, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world." Coordination and collaboration are precisely the laws that must be grasped in the current economic work. If the ideological style of small producers is allowed to develop without criticism and correction, it will not only harm economic work, but also easily lead to the error of decentralism when dealing with the relationship between leaders and those led; when dealing with the relationship between one's own department and other departments, it is easy to produce localism and isolationism. Therefore, it must be overcome and prevented. The saying and thinking of "everyone sweeps the snow from their own door" or "relying on oneself for everything and asking nothing of others" is completely unsuitable for the requirements of our work, so it must be given appropriate criticism, and the overall concept and the style of actively cooperating with other departments should be advocated and established.
    Strengthening the control and guidance of the state plan over national economic activities is of great significance for overcoming some disconnections between various sectors of the national economy and various economic tasks. On the one hand, due to the disproportionate and uncoordinated development of the economy in old China, and on the other hand, the current economic situation in our country is very complex, and planning work has just begun and lacks experience, it is difficult for our national economic plan to fully reflect the internal connections of various sectors of the national economy, and it is difficult to specifically guide the activities of every aspect of the national economy. Therefore, it is even more important to strengthen the guidance of planning work on economic activities. In the future, the state plan should not only stipulate the direction of national economic development and the principles of activities according to the law of planned development of the national economy, in accordance with the general line and various policies of the state and the actual work situation, but also give play to its specific organizational role, organize various sectors of the national economy into a whole in the process of formulating and inspecting the implementation of the plan, express the content of cooperation in the form of planned tasks, specifically assist the coordination and collaboration between various departments, eliminate some uncooperative and uncoordinated phenomena between various departments, various units, and various economic components, so that the work in all aspects can be carried out in harmony under the unified plan of the state, so as to ensure the planned development of various economic undertakings in our country and ensure that the entire national economy advances along the socialist track.
    In addition to correcting understanding ideologically, establishing an overall concept and overall perspective, and using the role of the state plan to strengthen cooperation and collaboration between various sectors of the national economy, it is also necessary to overcome all uncooperative and uncoordinated phenomena from an organizational and institutional perspective. The system of division of labor and dedicated responsibility is not only necessary, but also should be strengthened day by day, but at the same time as establishing the system of division of labor and dedicated responsibility, a system of mutual connection must be established, which can help the true implementation of the system of division of labor and dedicated responsibility. The division of labor and dedicated responsibility that cannot cooperate and collaborate, and the isolated division of labor and dedicated responsibility are not only useless, but even harmful. We absolutely do not need such a division of labor and dedicated responsibility. What we need is a division of labor and dedicated responsibility system that can implement the connection system. The so-called connection system means that for matters involving other departments or other units, the competent unit should be responsible for preparing opinions on this work, finding other relevant departments or units for consultation, specifically determining the work's principles, steps, and methods, and designating responsible units, so that each can be specifically responsible for and cooperate with each other to complete the work tasks under unified steps. To this end, it is necessary to advocate the style of actively serving other departments and overcome passive attitudes such as waiting and shirking responsibility. Each department or unit should often and proactively understand the needs and difficulties of relevant departments, especially when determining the department's long-term plan and annual plan, it should fully consider the connection between the cause that the department is responsible for and the causes of other relevant departments, especially consider the requirements of relevant departments, include everything that can be done in the department's plan, and designate a responsible unit or person to be responsible for completing it on schedule. For certain problems with greater connections, such as the smelting of ferrous metals and the mining of coking coal, machinery manufacturing and the supply of steel, water conservancy construction and hydropower construction, as well as industrial basic construction and railway construction, power supply and urban construction, etc., the competent department should be the main party and absorb relevant units to organize a special committee or special group to regularly contact and specifically solve problems. In order for the connection system to play a role and be fixed in a certain form, the form of a contract should be adopted when necessary, and the relevant departments should conclude a contract to stipulate the work content into articles, so as to achieve both close cooperation and division of labor and responsibility. In this way, we can avoid major loopholes and errors and shortcomings in the country's construction undertakings.
    Our country's construction undertakings are advancing rapidly, economic affairs are becoming increasingly complex, and there are many new things for us to understand and new problems for us to solve. Therefore, continuously improving the level of economic leadership to meet the requirements of the development of objective things is our responsibility that we cannot slacken for a day. At present, the issue of cooperation and collaboration has become a problem that must be solved in our economic activities, and we must correctly solve it so that our cause can move forward better.

### 加强国民经济各部门间的配合和协作

    加强国民经济各部门间的配合和协作
    随着国家建设的大规模进行，我们在经济方面的事务也就日益增多。为了有条不紊地处理各项经济事务，国民经济各部门实行细密的分工和确立专责制度，是完全必要的。如果没有这种分工专责制度，各项经济事务就不能及时地得到正确的处理，就要影响甚至损害国家的建设事业，这是没有疑问的。但是，在一部分干部甚至领导干部中，他们把这种分工专责错误地理解为可以各搞一套，各自为政，可以孤立地进行自己的工作；他们不注意甚至不大愿意在工作中和别的部门协作配合，把别的部门要求和本部门配合协作的事情当成“麻烦”和“额外负担”，这是错误的。
    这种孤立地各自为政的想法和作法，在我们实际工作中是比较普遍的存在着。它影响着国家建设事业的进行，在某些方面还造成了一些危害。如某些新建、扩建的企业，由于在地质、设备、材料、交通等方面得不到其他部门的密切配合，就拖延了设计或施工的期限，无法确定设计任务书；某些生产厂矿，由于在原材料供应和产品推销方面得不到其他部门的配合，设备效能不能充分发挥，甚至要停工减产，使那些为国家和人民急需的产品不能得到充分的供应；某些基本建设项目的地质勘察、搜集资料及设计等工作由于没有互相协作进行，往往工作重复，浪费人力财力，而且因为技术力量的分散使用，不能很好地完成任务。
    从整个国民经济部门来说，在工业和农业之间，工农业生产和商品流转及交通运输之间，经济建设和其他各项建设之间，在配合和协作上尚存在着不少问题。从工业内部来说，采掘工业和加工工业之间，或这一采掘工业和那一采掘工业之间，这一加工工业和那一加工工业之间，也常发生缺乏协作配合或协作配合得不好的问题。而且，不论是国民经济各部门或工业内部，在长远打算和目前部署，国营和私营，中央各经济部门和地方各经济部门等等方面，也存在许多协作配合这一类问题。即在一个部门的各专业局之间，一个厂矿的各车间（坑口）之间，一个车间的各工段之间，或是一个公司、一个商店、一段铁路内部的各单位之间，同样存在着协作配合不够密切的现象。我们国家建设事业中曾发生过的那些漏洞和缺点，虽然各有其直接和间接的原因，而且共同的原因又在于我们缺乏建设经验，但工作中缺乏配合和协作，往往是某些漏洞和缺点形成的一个重要原因。
    分工专责和协作配合，本来是统一的，并不是对立的。那种以为有了分工专责就可以不要协作配合的想法和作法，实际上是思想方法的片面性的一种表现，是缺乏总体观念和全局观点的表现。因为不要协作、不愿协作的想法和作法，主要是从本部门、本单位的局部要求出发的。只看到局部，忽略了整体；只看到本部门的需要，忽略了其他部门的需要，就常常在别的部门要求本部门配合时产生怕麻烦的情绪。其实，别的部门如果没有本部门的配合，固然难于做好工作，而本部门的工作如果没有其他部门的配合，又何尝能做好呢？譬如说，冶炼工业如果没有机械工业供应大量的设备，没有燃料工业供应大量的电力和煤炭，就无法生产；而机械工业如果没有冶炼工业供应大量钢铁等金属原料，同样无法制造各个部门所需要的设备，这是显而易见的道理。马克思早就说过：“人们在生产中不仅影响着自然界，而且彼此互相影响着。他们如果不用相当方式结合起来共同活动和互相交换其活动，便不能生产。为了实现生产，人们便发生一定的联系和关系，只有经过这些社会联系和社会关系，才会有人们对于自然界的关系存在，才会有生产”（“马恩全集”第五卷）。斯大林同志也说：“生产在任何时候和任何条件下都是社会的生产”（“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”）。马克思和斯大林所说的那种生产的社会联系和关系，在阶级社会中一方面表现为阶级的关系，另方面又表现为各种经济之间的联系；在已经消灭了剥削被剥削关系的社会中（如苏联），或在社会主义性质的经济领域中（如我国和各人民民主国家的国营经济），则只表现为各种经济的联系。这种联系，随着工业的日益发展而更加复杂，更加密切，也就要求我们在工作中更进一步地互相配合，互相协作，互相服务。
    在某些同志或某些部门中存在的那种不愿协作的想法和作法，其实质是小生产者的分散、孤立等特点在思想上、工作作风上的反映，它和工人阶级特有的那种总体思想和集体主义精神是根本不相容的。即使在过去农村工作的环境中，在分散独立作战的情况下，我们的工作也是在统一的领导、统一的指挥和统一政策的指导下进行的，也要求工作中有配合和协作。在全国解放后，我们接触到大规模的现代性的工业生产，接触到十分复杂的经济事务，即以农村来说，在它与城市的联系方面，也已起了深刻的变化，这就要求更高度的配合和协作。如果不配合不协作，就会造成更大的损失，产生更大的危害。毛主席在“实践论”中曾教导我们说：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性”。配合和协作，正是当前经济工作中必须掌握的规律。那种小生产者的思想作风，如果任其发展而不加批判纠正，不仅会危害经济工作，而且在处理领导与被领导的关系的时候，容易产生分散主义的错误；在处理本部门与其他部门的关系的时候，就容易产生本位主义和孤立主义的错误。因此必须克服和防止。那种“各人自扫门前雪”或“一切靠自己，万事不求人”的说法和想法，是完全不适合我们工作的要求的，因此必须给以适当的批判，并提倡和树立整体观念及主动与别的部门协作的作风。
    加强国家计划对国民经济活动的控制和指导作用，对克服国民经济各部门之间、各项经济工作之间的某些脱节现象是有重要意义的。一方面由于旧中国经济的发展不成比例互不配合，一方面我国当前经济状态又很复杂，计划工作也刚刚开始，缺乏经验，我们的国民经济计划还难于把国民经济各个部门的内部联系完全反映出来，并难于具体地指导国民经济每一方面的活动，因而加强计划工作对经济活动的指导就更其重要了。今后国家的计划，不仅应根据国民经济有计划发展的法则，按照国家的总路线和各项政策及实际工作情况规定国民经济发展的方向和活动的原则，而且应发挥其具体的组织作用，在编制计划和检查计划执行的过程中，将国民经济各部门组织成一个整体，将协作的内容用计划任务的形式表现出来，具体协助各部门之间的配合协作，消除各部门之间、各单位之间以及各种经济成份之间某些不协作不配合的现象，使各个方面的工作在国家统一的计划之下合拍地进行，以保证我国各项经济事业有计划地发展，保证整个国民经济沿着社会主义的轨道前进。
    除了从思想上端正认识，树立总体观念和全局观点，以及利用国家计划的作用来加强国民经济各部门之间的协作配合以外，还必须从组织上制度上来克服一切不协作不配合的现象。分工专责的制度不仅必要，而且应该日益加强，但在确立分工专责制度的同时，必须建立相互间的联系制度，这才能有助于分工专责制的真正贯彻。不能配合协作的分工专责，孤立地进行分工专责，不仅无益，甚至有害，我们绝对不需要这样的分工专责，我们需要的是能贯彻联系制度的分工专责制度。所谓联系制度，就是凡涉及其他部门或其他单位的事情，都应该由主管单位负责准备对这一工作的意见，找其他有关部门或单位进行协商，具体确定工作的方针、步骤和方法，并指定职责单位，在统一步调下各有专责地、相互配合地去完成工作任务。为此，就必须提倡主动地为别的部门服务的作风，克服等待、推诿等消极态度。每个部门或单位都应该经常地主动地了解有关部门的需要和困难，特别是在确定本部门的长期计划和年度计划的时候，应该充分考虑到本部门所负责的事业与其他有关部门的事业的联系，特别考虑到有关部门的要求，把一切可能争取办到的事情列入本部门计划之内，并指定专责单位或专人负责按期完成。凡某些联系性较大的问题，例如黑色金属的冶炼和炼焦煤的开采，机械制造和钢材的供应，水利建设和水电建设，以及工业基本建设和铁路建设，动力供应和城市建设等等，均应由主管部门为主，吸收有关单位组织成专门委员会或专门小组，经常联系，具体解决问题。为使联系制度能发挥作用并用一定形式固定下来，在必要时应采取合同的形式，由各有关部门订立合同，把工作内容规定成条文，作到既能密切协作又能分工负责。这样，我们就有可能避免国家建设事业中发生较大的漏洞和错误、缺点。
    我们国家的建设事业在飞快地前进，经济事务日益纷繁复杂，有很多新的事物要我们去认识，新的问题要我们去解决，因此，不断提高经济领导工作的水平，以适应客观事物发展的要求，正是我们不可一日懈怠的责任。在当前，配合协作问题已成为我们经济活动中必须解决的问题，我们必须正确地去解决它，使我们的事业能更好地前进。
