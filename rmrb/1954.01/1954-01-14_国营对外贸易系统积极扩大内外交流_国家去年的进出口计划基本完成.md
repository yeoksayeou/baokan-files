    Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: The state-owned foreign trade system has basically completed the state import and export plan for 1953, and has overfulfilled the annual profit delivery target. By the end of 1953, the profits turned over to the national treasury by various units had exceeded the approved annual plan by 0.53 percent after the increased production and economy campaign. It is estimated that the final settlement will show an additional 1500 billion yuan in profits turned over.
    The import system (including shipping and land transportation companies) performed well in completing profit delivery, and it is estimated that it will complete 132 percent of the annual plan; with the exception of the livestock, tea, and food companies, the profit plans of other export companies can be overfulfilled. The annual export plan was also 97 percent fulfilled, with exports to the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies being overfulfilled. The annual import arrival plan was also 97 percent fulfilled, with imports from the Soviet Union and Asian People's Democracies being overfulfilled, and imports from Eastern European People's Democracies being basically completed. This has ensured the needs of domestic production and construction and the people's livelihood, expanded internal and external exchanges, and promoted the prosperity and development of the peaceful and democratic market.
    In the fourth quarter of 1953, the foreign trade system comprehensively launched an increased production and economy campaign centered on completing the state plan. During the campaign, various export companies strengthened the work of organizing sources of goods and opened up new sources of goods; import companies and commercial counselors' offices stationed abroad strengthened contacts with relevant units abroad and, in coordination with transportation departments, promptly delivered the goods from abroad to various user departments. Various units also strengthened political and ideological leadership, improved business management and leadership methods, and laid the foundation for long-term implementation of increased production and economy.
    In order to better complete the tasks for 1954, the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Central People's Government has decided to conduct a comprehensive review of the department's work in the first quarter of this year, in conjunction with studying the general line of the state during the transition period, to improve the political and policy ideological level of cadres, and on this basis, arrange the work plan for 1954.

    国营对外贸易系统积极扩大内外交流
    国家去年的进出口计划基本完成
    【新华社十三日讯】国营对外贸易系统基本完成一九五三年度国家进出口计划，并超额完成全年上缴利润任务。到一九五三年年底，各单位上缴国库利润已超过增产节约运动后所核定全年计划百分之零点五三。预计决算结果，还可超额上缴一万五千亿元的利润。
    完成上缴利润情况较好的是进口系统（包括海、陆运公司），预计可完成全年计划的百分之一百三十二；出口系统除畜产、茶叶、食品三个公司外，其他出口公司的利润计划都可超额完成。全年出口计划也完成百分之九十七弱，其中对苏联和东欧各人民民主国家的都已超额完成。全年进口到货计划也完成百分之九十七，其中对苏联和亚洲各人民民主国家的都已超额完成，对东欧各人民民主国家的也基本完成。这就保证了国内生产建设和人民生活的需要，扩大了内外交流，并促进了和平民主市场的繁荣和发展。
    一九五三年第四季度，对外贸易系统全面开展了以完成国家计划为中心的增产节约运动。在运动中，各出口公司加强了组织货源的工作，开辟了新的货源；进口公司和驻国外商务参赞处加强了和国外有关单位的联系，并配合运输部门，将国外的交货及时运交各用货部门。各单位还加强了政治思想领导，改善了经营管理和领导方法，为长期贯彻增产节约打下基础。
    中央人民政府对外贸易部为了更好地完成一九五四年的任务，决定在今年第一季度内，结合学习国家过渡时期总路线，对该部门工作进行一次全面检查，以提高干部的政治和政策思想水平，并在此基础上安排一九五四年工作计划。
