Xishui County's Plan for Carrying Out Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Activities
Xishui County People's Cultural Center

Editor's Note: The Xishui County People's Cultural Center of Hubei Province's plan for propaganda work regarding this year's Spring Festival literary and artistic activities basically aligns with the spirit of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Culture's "Instructions on Carrying Out Rural Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Activities to Promote the General Line to Peasants." We are publishing its main parts here for reference by other regions.

Before formulating the Spring Festival literary and artistic activity propaganda work plan, the Xishui County People's Cultural Center first had its core members discuss and draft an outline. Then, it organized a symposium with the core members of a guidance area's theatrical troupe and all the troupe leaders from the town area to gather opinions. A meeting of all cadres from the cultural center and stations was convened to formally study and discuss the plan. These meetings all began by summarizing Spring Festival literary and artistic activities from previous years. At the same time, they earnestly studied and discussed the spirit of the Central Ministry of Culture's instructions, comprehending the six promotional contents within the instructions. In accordance with the instructions, they studied the People's Daily editorial on promoting the general line of the state during the transition period and the article "Promoting the General Line to Peasants." Zheng Si, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally came to Xishui to give instructions and participated in the specific guidance of the peasant creation group. Through this systematic study, all cultural center and station cadres and core members of mass literary and artistic activities fully comprehended the significant meaning of continuing to vigorously promote the general line through this year's Spring Festival literary and artistic activities. Following this, based on the spirit of the Central Ministry of Culture's instructions and in accordance with the specific instructions of the provincial and county committees, they repeatedly studied and drafted the propaganda work plan for carrying out Spring Festival literary and artistic activities.

Adequately Prepare
The most important key to preparing for Spring Festival literary and artistic activities is the unified leadership of the county committee. It is essential to organize all county-wide forces—including propagandists, radio stations, winter schools, film teams, rural theatrical troupes, and folk artists—through the systems of trade unions, cooperatives, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, banks, department stores, hospitals, and primary and secondary schools. Under the unified leadership and deployment of the county committee, these forces should participate in the propaganda work of Spring Festival literary and artistic activities. From the county to the township level, relevant units should be organized to establish Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Activity Propaganda Committees, which will operate under the leadership of party committees at all levels. The district- and township-level Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Activity Propaganda Committees should include representatives of mass organizations, as well as propaganda and cultural cadres, cultural station cadres, primary school principals, and theatrical troupe leaders. Each township should form entertainment groups based on electoral districts, using theatrical troupe actors and propagandists as the backbone and winter schools or mutual aid groups as the foundation.

In terms of guidance work, cultural centers and stations should focus on key areas, or organize mobile guidance teams to go deep into key areas, discover and cultivate folk art forms and folk music, and promote them in a timely manner through small-scale observation and performance meetings. The county plans to hold a folk art performance before the Spring Festival, and each district will hold small-scale exchange meetings based on actual conditions. Township theatrical troupes should cooperate with folk school teachers and returning students to guide the entertainment groups. The methods for theatrical troupes to guide entertainment groups are: one is for actors to go to folk schools to teach tunes, songs, and movements separately; the other is to adopt demonstration guidance methods, that is, each electoral district selects talented male and female literary and artistic activity members to concentrate together, and the theatrical troupe actors or the key entertainment groups cultivated by the theatrical troupe give demonstration performances.

Another important issue in preparation work is to ensure the supply of materials for Spring Festival publicity. Before the newly created materials are issued, each district theatrical troupe should earnestly review and rehearse the programs designated by the cultural center. Theatrical troupe actors should do their best to help entertainment groups in each electoral district rehearse and practice singing. For folk artists, especially blind artists, each district cultural station is responsible for organizing them to study at the district once, or entrust local students to teach them, and pay attention to organizing local students, teachers, and intellectuals in the countryside to help theatrical troupes and entertainment groups solve difficulties in copying lyrics, reading lyrics, and singing lyrics.

Promotional Content Should Be Rich and Forms Diverse
For promotional content that can be expressed in literary and artistic forms, on the one hand, programs that have been performed in the past should be re-organized and revised in accordance with the spirit of the general line. Some programs that are in line with the spirit of the general line and are popular with the masses should continue to be performed, and some programs need to be revised. On the other hand, organize peasant creation groups (six people), organize literary and artistic cadres, collectively create scripts, drum lyrics, and small and diverse performance materials. Also, organize painting talents from schools and institutions to draw pictures and prepare exhibition materials.

For some content that is not easily expressed completely in literary and artistic forms, based on relevant editorials and articles in the People's Daily, combined with real people and events in the county, district, or village, use dialogue, question and answer, and other forms to compile simple and easy-to-understand speeches, and give speeches before and after performances or during breaks. As for construction in industry, transportation, water conservancy, etc., and content such as Soviet collective farms, propaganda tools such as movies, slides, pictures, physical exhibitions, model exhibitions, books, and pictorials can be used. This can vividly and concretely promote the general line and meet the entertainment needs of the masses.

In terms of promotional forms, we should fully utilize more than 30 kinds of folk art forms such as lotus boats, double pushcarts, shadow puppets, drum books, lion dances, flower basket dances, and fan flowers, and vigorously promote the role of forms such as movies, slides, broadcasting, exhibitions, speeches, blackboards, books, and big-character posters.

Specific requirements: 1. Folk art forms: Based on last year's experience, more than 3,000 sets can be organized throughout the county. 2. Slides: The county has 14 slide projectors and 1 movie projector. In addition to the film team, each slide projector should be shown 10 times a month, requiring 200 viewers each time, for a total of 28,000 viewers. 3. Exhibitions: The county cultural center holds large-scale exhibitions, and the cultural stations in each district hold small-scale exhibitions. 4. Books and pictorials: All the comic strips and popular reading materials of the cultural centers and stations are sent to the farmers for the New Year in a planned and focused manner. 5. Blackboard newspapers: The blackboard newspapers controlled by primary schools are the responsibility of the primary schools, with guidance from the cultural stations; the blackboard newspapers controlled by theatrical troupes are organized by returning students to help run them, and the cultural centers and stations pay attention to key guidance.

Regarding Activities, Scope, and Time
The theatrical troupes, entertainment groups, and folk artists in each district and township, under unified leadership, should determine the activities, time, and scope based on the dispersed nature of rural production and the entertainment habits of the masses. The following schedule can be used as a reference.

Lunar New Year's Days 1 to 4: On the first day, theatrical troupes throughout county universally carry out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. For the remaining three days, entertainment activities can be freely and universally carried out in the township day and night. From the 5th to the 10th, they will be converted to entertainment evenings combined with meetings in the electoral districts at night, or small-scale observation and performance meetings will be held, and the theatrical troupes can also perform collectively. From the 11th to the 15th, mass large-scale activities will be carried out. Theatrical troupes will perform collectively or organize folk forms to hold observation and performance meetings. Activities can be freely carried out in the electoral districts. On the 16th, each district can hold diverse folk form performances based on the situation, with the guidance area or the district as the unit. From the 17th to the 20th, the excellent programs selected by the theatrical troupes of each township can be organized to perform for summary observation and performance, and commendation work can be carried out, with the guidance area as the base point.

Activities of the mobile propaganda team: Under the leadership of the County Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Activity Committee, the Cultural Center organizes social forces to organize two to three mobile propaganda service teams (ten people per team) to tour the districts for publicity and performance. Each district organizes local teachers or returning students based on the conditions, and organizes a mobile propaganda team to conduct activities in the district. The content of the activities should focus on speeches, slides, small exhibitions, and mobile book boxes.

Temple fair activities: On the one hand, the cultural centers and stations organize and guide mass literary and artistic activities. On the other hand, they should organize all possible forces to hold temple fairs, with the towns where they are located as the base point. The cultural stations in each district hold small-scale temple fairs as possible (the main content is holding physical object and picture exhibitions, organizing primary and secondary school students to conduct street speeches and folk art performances). The county cultural center takes the town as the entire activity area and the People's Square as the activity center to hold a large-scale temple fair.

Lay the Foundation for Further Rectification, Consolidation, and Improvement
According to the spirit of the Central Ministry of Culture's instructions, cultural and artistic organizations at all levels in the county must further rectify, consolidate, and improve from the aspects of organization, thought, and work methods through Spring Festival activities. We should discover and organize talented activists through winter schools and entertainment groups, so that they can be cultivated for a long time in the future. At the same time, we must pay close attention to adhering to and consolidating the position of the theatrical troupe, consolidating the exchange-oriented organizational form of the theatrical troupe's guidance committee, laying the foundation for future cultural popularization work, and further making the cultural centers and stations the center of mass cultural and entertainment activities.

At the same time, through Spring Festival activities, organize social forces to conduct an investigation of folk art forms and folk music. When the seasonal activities of the cultural centers and stations during the Spring Festival turn into regular activities, we must pay attention to studying which forms and methods are suitable for regular mass amateur literary and artistic activities, can adapt to the characteristics of rural production, and can be easily accepted by the masses. We must conduct such investigation and research work in order to lay the foundation for further rectification, consolidation, and improvement, and to improve the mass cultural and artistic work in the county to better adapt to the general line and serve production and construction.

Finally, it should be particularly pointed out that in carrying out Spring Festival literary and artistic activities, we must pay close attention to preventing extravagance and waste and preventing gambling. We should actively create more and healthier literary and artistic activity methods to guide farmers to live a new cultural life.

    浠水县开展春节文艺活动的计划
    浠水县人民文化馆
    编者按：湖北省浠水县人民文化馆关于今年春节文艺活动的宣传工作计划，基本上是符合中央人民政府文化部“关于开展春节农村文艺活动向农民宣传总路线的指示”的精神的。现将其主要部分发表，以供各地参考。
    浠水县人民文化馆在制订春节文艺活动宣传工作计划以前，首先由文化馆骨干讨论和拟订一个纲要，接着组织一个辅导区的剧团骨干和城关区全区剧团团长座谈，听取意见，并召开文化馆站全体干部会议，正式研究讨论计划。这些会议都从总结历年来春节文艺活动着手，同时认真学习和讨论中央文化部指示的精神，领会指示中的六项宣传内容，并依照指示规定，学习了人民日报关于宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线的社论和“向农民宣传总路线”的文章。中共湖北省委宣传部郑思部长亲自来浠水指示工作，并参加农民创作小组具体指导。经过这样有系统的学习，全体文化馆站干部和群众文艺活动骨干，都充分领会到通过今年春节文艺活动，继续大张旗鼓宣传总路线的重大意义。接着就根据中央文化部指示精神，遵照省委和县委的具体指示，反复研究和拟订了开展春节文艺活动的宣传工作计划。
    充分做好准备工作
    春节文艺活动准备工作的重要关键，是县委的统一领导。必须通过工会、合作社、青年团、妇联、银行、百货公司、卫生院和中、小学校等系统，组织全县宣传员、收音站、冬学、电影队、农村剧团、民间艺人等各方面力量，在县委统一领导布置下，参加春节文艺活动的宣传工作。自县到乡，组织有关单位，成立春节文艺活动宣传委员会，在各级党委的领导下进行工作。区、乡级的春节文艺活动宣传委员会，吸收各群众团体的代表及宣传文教干部、文化站干部、小学校长、剧团团长等为委员。各乡以选区为单位，以剧团演员、宣传员为骨干，以冬学或互助组为基础，组成文娱小组。
    在辅导工作上，文化馆站应该掌握重点，或组织流动的辅导组深入重点，发掘与培养民间艺术形式与民间音乐，并及时采取小型观摩会演的方式，加以推广。县里准备在春节前举行民间艺术会演，各区根据实际情况举行小型的交流会。各乡剧团要协同民校教师及回乡学生辅导各文娱小组。剧团对文娱组辅导的办法：一种是演员分头下民校教板、教唱、教动作；另一种是采取示范辅导办法，就是各选区挑选能唱的男女文艺活动分子集中在一起，由剧团演员，或剧团所培养的重点文娱小组示范表演。
    准备工作的另一个重要问题，就是做好春节文艺宣传的材料供应工作。在新创作的材料未发下以前，各区剧团按照文化馆所指定的节目认真复习排练。剧团演员更应尽力帮助各选区文娱小组排演和练唱。对民间艺人，特别是盲艺人，各区文化站负责组织到区学习一次，或委托当地学生传授，并注意组织当地学生、教师、在乡知识分子，帮助剧团和文娱组，解决抄词、读词、唱词上的困难。
    宣传内容要丰富，形式要多样
    对可以用文艺形式表现的宣传内容，一方面把以往演唱的节目，根据总路线的精神，再次加以整理和修改。有些节目符合总路线精神并受群众欢迎的，应继续演唱，有些节目有修改的必要。另一方面，组织农民创作小组（六人），组织文艺干部，集体创作剧本、鼓词以及小型多样的演唱材料。并组织学校和机关的绘画人材，绘画图片，准备展览资料。
    有些不容易用文艺形式完整地表现出来的内容，以人民日报有关社论和文章为依据，联系本县本区或本村的真人真事，采用对话、问答等形式，编成简单通俗讲词，在演出前后或间歇时间演讲。至于工业、交通、水利等建设和苏联集体农庄等内容，可以运用电影、幻灯、图片、实物展览、模型展览、图书、画报等宣传工具，这样既可以生动具体地宣传总路线，又可以满足群众娱乐的要求。
    在宣传形式上，应充分运用采莲船、双推车、皮影、鼓书、舞狮、花篮舞、扇子花等三十多种民间艺术形式，大力发挥电影、幻灯、广播、展览、演讲、黑板报、图书、大字报等形式的作用。
    具体要求：一、民间艺术形式：根据去年的经验，全县可组织三千多套。二、幻灯：全县十四架幻灯，一架电影机。除电影队外，每一架幻灯在一个月内，放映十次，要求每次观众二百人，观众共两万八千人。三、展览：县文化馆举办大型展览，各区文化站举办小型展览。四、图书画报：文化馆站所有的连环画及通俗的读物，有计划、有重点送给农民过年。五、黑板报：小学校掌握的黑板报，由小学校负责，文化站辅导；剧团掌握的黑板报，组织回乡学生帮助来办，文化馆站注意重点辅导。
    关于活动的方式、范围和时间
    各区、乡的剧团、文娱组与民间艺人在统一领导下，应根据农村生产分散情况与群众娱乐活动的习惯，确定活动方式、时间和范围。以下的时间安排可作参考。
    旧历正月初一至初四：初一，全县各剧团普遍开展拥军优属活动，其余三天，白天夜晚可以在本乡自由普遍地开展文娱活动；初五到初十转为夜间在本选区结合会议举行娱乐晚会，或者进行小型观摩会演，剧团也可以集中演出；十一日至十五日开展群众性的大型活动，剧团集中演出或组织民间形式进行观摩会演，活动范围可以在本选区自由活动；十六日各区可根据情况，以辅导区或以区为单位进行多种多样的民间形式会演；十七日至二十日，可以辅导区为基点，组织各乡剧团推选优秀的节目，进行总结性的观摩演出，并进行评功表模工作。
    流动宣传队的活动方式：文化馆在县春节文艺活动委员会领导下，组织社会力量，组织两个到三个流动宣传服务队（每队十人），到各区巡回宣传表演。各区根据条件组织当地教师或回乡同学，组织一个流动宣传队在本区活动。活动内容应以演讲、幻灯、小型展览、图书流动箱为主。
    庙会活动方式：文化馆站，一方面组织、辅导群众性的文艺活动，另方面应以所在地的城镇为基点，组织一切可能组织的力量，举行庙会。各区文化站根据可能举行小型庙会（主要内容举办实物、图片展览，组织中小学生进行街头演讲和民间艺术表演），县文化馆以城关为整个活动区域，以人民广场为活动中心，举办大型庙会。
    为进一步整顿、巩固和提高
      工作打下基础
    根据中央文化部指示的精神，全县各级文化艺术组织，必须通过春节活动，进一步从组织上、思想上、工作方法上加以整顿、巩固和提高。我们应通过冬学和各文娱小组，发现并组织有才能的积极分子，以便将来长期培养。同时，要密切注意坚持巩固剧团的阵地，巩固剧团辅导委员会的交流性质的组织形式，为今后文化普及工作打下基础，进一步使文化馆站成为群众文化娱乐活动的中心。
    同时，通过春节活动，组织社会力量，把民间艺术形式、民间音乐，进行一次调查。文化馆站在春节季节性的活动转入经常性活动的时候，必须注意研究哪些形式与方式方法是能够适合经常性的群众业余文艺活动，能适合农村生产的特点，并能为群众所乐于接受。必须进行这样的调查和研究工作，才能为进一步整顿、巩固和提高打下基础，才有可能提高全县群众性的文化艺术工作，更好地适应总路线，为生产建设服务。
    最后，应该特别指出：在进行春节文艺活动中，要严加注意防止铺张浪费，防止赌博。应积极创造更多更健康的文艺活动办法，引导农民过新的文化生活。
