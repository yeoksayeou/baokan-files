Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: The People's Bank of China issued huge agricultural loans to rural areas across the country in 1953. This loan was allocated under the circumstances of the country needing to invest a large amount of funds in industrial construction. The state's loans have greatly promoted the development of agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation among farmers.

According to incomplete statistics, the People's Bank of China issued a total of 15,665.5 billion yuan in agricultural loans in 1953 (the highest year-end balance reached more than 9700 billion yuan), an increase of 115% over 1952. Judging from the highest monthly balance of loans, loans to state-owned agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy enterprises accounted for 10.44%, and loans to farmers accounted for 89.56%. Among the farmers who received loans, poor peasants, farmhands, and middle peasants with difficulties received the most loans. Last year, in addition to continuing to provide loans to organized farmers, the People's Bank of China also particularly strengthened assistance to individual farmers, impoverished mountainous areas, and farmers in old revolutionary base areas. According to statistics on loans from 32 county sub-branches in Shanxi Province, organized farmers received 42% of the total loan amount, and individual farmers received 58% of the total loan amount. In Shaanxi Province, farmers in mountainous areas and old revolutionary base areas accounted for approximately 30% of the province's total number of farmers, and cultivated land accounted for 38%. In 1952, farmers in these areas received only 14.4% of the province's total loan amount, which increased to 27.1% in 1953. Some villages in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces that had never received loans in the past received loans last year. Last year, some areas experienced floods or droughts, and branches of the People's Bank of China in various places issued large amounts of production and disaster relief loans, providing strong support to the affected farmers. According to statistics from 24 branches and offices in Shandong, Hebei, and other provinces, this loan amounted to more than 1,300 billion yuan. In the process of issuing loans, branches of the People's Bank of China in various places paid attention to the actual needs of farmers, did not rigidly stipulate the use of loans, did not mechanically emphasize the dedicated use of funds, and changed the lending of goods to lending cash, so that farmers could freely purchase means of production.

After receiving state loans, farmers actively built water conservancy projects, purchased means of production, improved agricultural production, and consolidated mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Farmers in eleven provinces, including Henan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Shanxi, Hebei, Suiyuan, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Songjiang, Rehe, Liaodong, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as well as the suburbs of six cities, including Beijing, Wuhan, Xi'an, Fushun, and Shenyang, used more than 1,000 billion yuan in loans to dig and repair 57,327 small wells, build and repair 121,274 large and small water conservancy projects, purchase 33,991 waterwheels, 21,594 sets of animal-drawn farm implements, 25,744 plows, and a large number of new-style walking plows, sprayers, fertilizers, and pesticides. According to partial statistics from 76 sub-branches in Hunan Province, farmers used more than 40 billion yuan in water conservancy loans to repair more than 140,000 water conservancy projects such as large and small ponds and dams, which can irrigate more than 3,385,900 mu of farmland, benefiting more than 844,200 households. The 3.9 billion yuan in water conservancy loans issued in Jiuquan Special District, Gansu Province, turned more than 209,000 mu of barren and arid land into paddy fields, which can increase grain production by more than 15 million jin per year. Tan Quansheng's mutual aid group in the Eighth District of Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, received a loan of 1.08 million yuan for draft cattle and feeding last year, and buying draft cattle saved more than 1 million yuan in cattle rental fees for borrowing cattle for plowing in one year, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the group members. The group members said: In the past, without cattle, people's hearts were scattered. This year, we bought cattle with loans, and everyone is united. The farmers are very satisfied and grateful for the state loans. Wang Mo, a poor peasant in Chengguan District, Dingxi County, Gansu Province, said: "I borrowed seven dou of wheat seeds from the government and planted two and a half mu of land, harvesting more than five dan of grain. If it weren't for the bank loan, I wouldn't have been able to plant."

Thanks to state loans, farmers in various places have developed production and truly benefited. Therefore, after the autumn harvest, they actively repaid the principal and interest of the loans. By the end of last year, the national recovery of matured loans had reached about 90% of the expected amount. At present, the work of repaying loans is still being actively carried out by farmers in various places.

    人民银行去年发放巨额农业贷款
    有效地帮助农民提高生产和发展互助合作
    【新华社二十五日讯】中国人民银行一九五三年在全国各地农村发放了巨额农业贷款。这笔贷款，是在国家需要以大批资金投入工业建设的情况下拨出的。国家的贷款，对扶助农民发展农业生产和开展互助合作有很大的推动作用。
    据不完全统计，一九五三年人民银行共发放农业贷款十五万六千六百五十五亿元（全年最高余额达九万七千多亿元），比一九五二年增加了百分之一百一十五。从各月中贷款的最高余额来看，贷给国营农林水利企业的贷款占百分之十点四四，贷给农民的占百分之八十九点五六。得到贷款的农民中，贫雇农和有困难的中农获得贷款最多。去年，人民银行除了继续对组织起来的农民贷款外，还特别加强了对单干农民和贫瘠的山区以及老根据地农民的帮助。据山西省三十二个县支行贷款的统计，已组织起来的农民得到的贷款占贷款总额的百分之四十二；单干农民得到的贷款占贷款总额的百分之五十八。陕西省山区和老根据地区的农户大约占全省农户总数的百分之三十，耕地占百分之三十八。一九五二年这些地区的农民得到的贷款仅占全省贷款总额的百分之十四点四，一九五三年增加到了百分之二十七点一。云南、贵州等省有些过去从没有得到贷款的乡村，去年得到了贷款。去年，有部分地区发生水灾或旱灾，各地人民银行的分支行发放了大批生产救灾贷款，对受灾农民作了有力的支援。据山东、河北等二十四个行、处的统计，这项贷款约达一万三千多亿元。各地人民银行的分支机构在发放贷款中，注意照顾农民的实际需要，不硬性规定贷款用途，不机械强调专款专用，并改贷实物为贷现款，使农民能够自由选购生产资料。
    农民得到国家的贷款后，纷纷兴修水利，购买生产资料，提高了农业生产，巩固了互助合作组织。河南、广西、四川、山西、河北、绥远、新疆、宁夏、松江、热河、辽东等十一个省和内蒙古自治区以及北京、武汉、西安、抚顺、沈阳等六个市的郊区的农民，以一万多亿元贷款，凿井和整修小井五万七千三百二十七眼，兴修大小水利工程十二万一千二百七十四处，购置水车三万三千九百九十一辆，马拉农具二万一千五百九十四件，铲趟机二万五千七百四十四台，以及大批新式步犁、喷雾器、肥料、农药。湖南省据七十六个支行部分材料统计，农民以四百多亿元水利贷款修好大小塘坝等水利工程十四万多处，能灌溉田亩三百三十八万五千九百多亩，受益农户达八十四万四千二百多户。甘肃省酒泉专区发放的三十九亿元水利贷款，使得二十万九千多亩荒旱地变为水田，每年约可增产粮食一千五百多万斤。湖南省湘潭县八区谭全胜互助组去年得到耕牛和饲养贷款一百零八万元，买了耕牛，一年就省去了借牛耕地所要付出的一百多万元牛租费，大大鼓舞了组员的情绪。组员们说：过去没有牛，人心是散的，今年贷款买了牛，大家都成了一条心了。农民对国家贷款非常满意和感激。甘肃省定西县城关区贫农王谟说：“我借了政府七斗麦种，种下了二垧半地，打了五石多粮食。要不是银行贷款，我就种不上。”
    各地农民由于国家贷款帮助，生产发展了，真正得到了好处。所以在秋收以后，都积极归还贷款本息。到去年年底，全国收回的到期贷款，已达到预计数的百分之九十左右。现在，各地农民归还贷款工作还在继续踊跃进行中。
