    Those Who Treat Candy as Trash Must Be Dealt With Severely

    Readers Su Jun and Zhi Xue write: In Changchun City, an incident occurred where 7,745 kilograms of candy turned into garbage.

    The Changchun Jilin Provincial Food Factory had a large batch of fruit candies, Rendan candies, soft candies, and milk candies that had become damp and deteriorated due to poor storage, or had been returned after sale due to spoilage. Employees repeatedly suggested reprocessing or converting this batch of candy into caramel coloring to avoid affecting people's health and reduce the state's losses. However, the responsible cadres of the factory turned a deaf ear to these suggestions, allowing the candy to continue to melt and deteriorate in the warehouse. After the Patriotic Health Campaign was launched, the factory directors found a "thorough" and "easy" way to "pay attention to hygiene": treating the deteriorated candy, cream, eggs, along with packaging materials such as cardboard boxes, wooden boxes, and even iron buckets, as garbage and burying them.

    Initially, when burying the candy a few times, the factory "frankly" reported to the higher authorities that it had buried more than 1,000 kilograms of deteriorated candy (actually more than 3,000 kilograms). After receiving the report, the Jilin Provincial Department of Industry routinely replied with an official document stating: "Burial of deteriorated candy is approved for write-off. Other deteriorated candy can be reprocessed, but those responsible for dereliction of duty must be held accountable and reported to the department for handling." Afterward, the deteriorated candy was still not reprocessed, and those who had derelicted their duty all remained "calm and unruffled." The "burying" method continued to be used as usual, and even developed to the point of burying some non-deteriorated candy together, simply ceasing to report it. From July 1952 to July 1953, over the course of a year, in this way, ten times in total, candy alone was buried amounting to 7,745 kilograms, worth 66.7 million yuan.

    Treating state property as dirt! The dereliction of duty of the leading cadres of the Jilin Provincial Food Factory is truly intolerable!

### 必须查处那些把糖果当成垃圾的人

    必须查处那些把糖果当成垃圾的人
    读者素君、志学来信：在长春市，发生了一件七千七百四十五公斤糖果变成垃圾的事。
    长春吉林省食品工厂有一大批因保管不良而受潮变质或出售后变质而被退回来的水果糖、仁丹糖、软糖、牛奶糖。职工们屡次建议把这批糖果加工复制或制成糖色，以免影响人民健康，减少国家的损失。可是该厂负责干部对这些建议却充耳不闻，让这些糖果继续在仓库里溶化、变质。爱国卫生运动开展后，厂长们为了“注意卫生”，找到了一个“彻底”、“省事”的做法：把变质的糖果、奶油、鸡蛋，连同纸盒、木箱甚至铁桶等包装用具，一起当作垃圾埋掉。
    当初几次埋糖果时，厂里还“坦白”地向上级报告说：埋掉已变质的糖果一千多公斤（实际上是三千多公斤）。吉林省工业厅接到报告后，照例公文批回称：“变质埋掉，准予报销，其它变质之糖可加工复制，但对有关失职人员，要追究责任，报厅听候处理。”事后，变质的糖果仍未加工复制，失职的人员也都“安之若素”。“埋”的办法照常使用，甚至更发展到把某些没有变质的糖果混在一起埋掉，干脆不再上报。从一九五二年七月到一九五三年七月一年当中，这样前后十次，仅糖果一项即被埋掉七千七百四十五公斤，价值六千六百七十万元。
    把国家的财产当作粪土！吉林省食品工厂领导干部这种失职行为，真是令人不能容忍！
