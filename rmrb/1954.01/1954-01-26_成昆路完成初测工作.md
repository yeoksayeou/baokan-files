    Preliminary Survey Work Completed for the Chengdu-Kunming Railway

    The preliminary survey work for the Chengdu-Kunming Railway has been fully completed, and the alignment and design work is about to begin. The future Chengdu-Kunming Railway will be 1,033 kilometers long. The Chengdu to Neijiang section is 223 kilometers long and utilizes the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The Neijiang to Kunming section is 810 kilometers long and will be newly constructed. The preliminary survey work from Neijiang to Kunming was conducted simultaneously in the southern, central, and northern sections. The preliminary survey work for the southern and central sections was completed ahead of schedule in early December of last year, and the preliminary survey work for the northern section was completed on December 30th of last year.

    The railway line from Neijiang to Kunming crosses the turbulent Jinsha River three times and climbs over sparsely populated and precipitous mountains. The survey and design personnel of the 14th, 17th, and 18th Survey and Design Teams, who were responsible for the preliminary survey work, climbed mountains and waded through rivers, endured hunger and cold, and overcame numerous difficulties to successfully complete the preliminary survey work for the entire line. Most of the members of the 14th Survey and Design Team, who were responsible for the preliminary survey task of the northern section, were track maintenance workers transferred from various parts of East China and were not familiar with surveying and mapping techniques. However, because they were able to study diligently and learn modestly, they quickly mastered the technology. They brought into play their collective wisdom to overcome almost unimaginable difficulties. The staff of each survey and design team actively studied the advanced Soviet surveying and design experience. After they adopted the "double-sided stadia method" in leveling, their work efficiency increased by 175 percent.

    成昆路完成初测工作
    成昆铁路的初测工作已经全部完成，定线和设计工作即将开始。未来的成昆铁路全长一千零三十三公里。成都到内江段长二百二十三公里，系利用成渝铁路，内江到昆明段长八百一十公里，全部新建。内江到昆明的初测工作是分南段、中段和北段同时进行的。南段和中段的初测工作在去年十二月初旬就已提前完成，北段的初测工作在去年十二月三十日完成。
    从内江到昆明的铁路线三次经过水流湍急的金沙江，并且要爬过人烟稀少的险峻高山。担任初测工作的第十四、十七、十八三个勘测设计总队的勘测设计人员，爬山涉水、忍饿挨冻、克服了重重困难，胜利完成了全线的初测工作。担任北段初测任务的第十四勘测设计总队的队员们，大多是从华东各地调来的养路工人，不熟悉勘测技术。但由于他们能刻苦钻研，虚心学习，很快地就掌握了技术。他们发挥集体智慧克服了几乎难以想像的困难。各勘测设计总队的工作人员积极学习了苏联先进的勘测设计经验。他们采用了水准测量方面的“双面搭尺法”以后，工作效率提高了百分之一百七十五。
