    Staff of the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission
    Enthusiastically Subscribe to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds
    [Our Newspaper] Since the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission's directly affiliated units began subscribing to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds on December 23rd of last year, they have already subscribed to 240% of the predetermined amount ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.
    Prior to subscribing to the National Economic Construction Bonds, the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission's directly affiliated units held a meeting of political work cadres on December 18th of last year to arrange the work of promoting the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. Subsequently, each unit held soldiers' meetings, and each study group held meetings for deliberation and discussion. Everyone fully recognized the important significance of the state issuing economic construction bonds. Although the material life of the staff in each unit is still quite difficult, it has improved much more than in the past. Everyone enthusiastically and voluntarily subscribed to the bonds with a high degree of patriotic zeal. After listening to the report, the cadres of the General Office of the General Political Department signed up for subscriptions on the spot; the cadres of the Organization Department quickly overfulfilled their subscription task; the Propaganda Department exceeded the original subscription figure by 3.8 times in a few days; the leaders of the General Political Department took the lead in subscribing. When subscribing to the bonds, many cadres took out their allowances saved over a long period of frugality, and some cadres, even with family economic burdens, carefully calculated and saved money to subscribe. They said: The purpose of the long-term arduous struggle of the People's Liberation Army is to enable the country to transition to socialism. Now that we save some money and can purchase bonds to directly support the country's socialist industrialization, it is our glory and pride! According to regulations, the scope of troops subscribing to bonds is limited to cadres at the platoon level and above. However, many soldiers in the directly affiliated units of the General Political Department also firmly requested to subscribe. Despite repeated persuasion from their superiors, many soldiers still took out their allowances saved over a long period to subscribe to the bonds.
    After subscribing to the bonds, the directly affiliated units of the General Political Department have determined the payment dates. Many staff members are preparing to pay in full within January of this year, and the general payment date will not exceed the end of March. The subscription work is still continuing.

    军委总政治部直属机关工作人员
    踊跃认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债
    【本报讯】中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部直属各单位在去年十二月二十三日开始认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债以来，已提前并超额认购了预定数目的百分之二百四十。
    在认购国家经济建设公债之前，军委总政治部直属机关在去年十二月十八日召开了机关政治工作干部会议，布置推销一九五四年国家经济建设公债的工作。接着，各单位召开了军人大会，各学习小组开会进行了酝酿和讨论，大家都充分认识了国家发行经济建设公债的重要意义。各单位工作人员的物质生活虽然还相当艰苦，但较过去已提高得多了，大家都以高度的爱国主义热情自觉自愿地踊跃认购公债。总政治部秘书处干部听了报告后，当场签名认购；组织部干部迅速地超额完成了认购任务；宣传部在几天内就超过原定认购数字的三点八倍；总政治部的首长都率先认购。在认购公债时，许多干部拿出了自己长期省吃俭用积蓄下来的津贴费，有的干部虽然有家庭经济负担，但也精打细算，省下钱来认购。他们说：人民解放军长期艰苦奋斗的目的就是为了使国家过渡到社会主义去，现在我们节省一些，能购买公债直接支援国家的社会主义工业化建设，正是我们的光荣和骄傲！根据规定，部队认购公债的范围只限于排以上干部。但总政治部直属各单位的许多战士，也坚决要求认购，虽经上级一再说服，许多战士还是拿出了长期积蓄下来的津贴费来认购公债。
    总政治部直属各单位在认购公债后，都确定了缴款日期，许多工作人员准备在今年一月份内缴清，一般缴款日期也不超过三月底。现在认购工作仍在继续进行中。
