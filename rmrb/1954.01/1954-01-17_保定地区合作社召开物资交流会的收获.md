The Baoding Special District Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Baoding City Cooperative General Association, in order to vigorously cooperate with the state's grain procurement and ensure the supply of materials, convened an internal material exchange conference in early December 1953. The conference was mainly for cooperatives but also included state-owned trading companies and handicraft production cooperatives. A total of 343 units participated in this material exchange conference. During the six-day session, the total purchase and sale value reached 193.95096 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan by 142.2 percent; 1,994 supply contracts were signed. Of the total purchase and sale amount, production materials accounted for 9.7 percent, and consumer goods accounted for 90.3 percent. Among the exchanged products, the sales of handicrafts and local specialties amounted to 8.15357 billion yuan. Through this conference, not only was the connection between cooperatives and state-owned trading companies, handicraft production cooperatives, and small handicraftsmen in production, supply, and marketing strengthened, but also the sources of goods for the cooperatives were expanded and enriched, creating favorable conditions for cooperating with grain procurement work.

Major Achievements of the Conference

I. Vigorously organizing local sources of goods, enriching the material strength of grassroots cooperatives, and stimulating and supporting the development of local industry and handicrafts. In order to meet the diverse needs of cooperative members, the conference systematically displayed 344 kinds of local products produced locally, such as iron and wooden farm tools, small hardware, household utensils, Gaoyang cloth, mountain goods, wood, and stone. Therefore, the outstanding feature of the conference was that all representatives focused on purchasing production materials and local specialties. For example, the Zhuoxian Cooperative delegation purchased 1.4 billion yuan worth of local products such as small farm tools, accounting for 20 percent of its total purchase amount, including 60.0963 million yuan worth of processing orders from seven handicraft production cooperatives. Various types of wood and wicker produced in the mountainous areas of Laishui, which had been completely ignored in the past, sold 70,000 wooden handles, 60,000 jin of wicker, 20,000 rafters, and 1,700 bundles of various cover strips and Yi shares in just two days at the conference, as well as a large amount of persimmons, walnuts, and some stone materials. This played a significant role in helping the people in mountainous areas develop production and improve their lives. According to the director of the county cooperative, "In order to transport these mountain goods, it will be necessary to mobilize 5,333 head of livestock and 2,600 laborers for one month, and the income from livestock and labor will reach 1.04 million jin of millet." The most popular products in the exchange were iron and wood products. According to incomplete statistics, more than 24,000 pieces of farm tools and small hardware tools were sold. The production units not only sold out all the available goods, but also had all the products for the first quarter of this year reserved. For example, the Laishui Chengguan Ironware Production Cooperative sold products worth 36.86 million yuan at the conference, plus 30 million yuan in contracts being executed, and it will not be able to complete this batch of products until the end of April 1954. The production cooperative has also established supply and marketing relationships with many supply and marketing cooperatives in this county and other counties, and plans to add two new furnaces this year, develop eight new members, and increase output value by 50 percent to meet the needs of various regions. The Baoding City Weaving Production Cooperative, because it established a business relationship with the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and improved the specifications and colors of its products according to the needs of the local people, was generally welcomed at this conference. It sold existing goods and received orders for a total of 1,358 pieces of various types of cloth, worth more than 420 million yuan. The meeting proved that as long as production and sales meet, and supply and marketing cooperatives and production cooperatives and handicraftsmen sign supply and marketing business contracts, not only will the supply of goods for supply and marketing cooperatives be enriched, making supply and marketing operations more planned, but also the development and expansion of reproduction of handicraft production cooperatives and small handicraftsmen can be supported, enabling them to serve national construction and the needs of the people.

II. Further implementing the policy of reducing management levels and vigorously supporting the development of grassroots cooperatives. In the transactions at the meeting, the principle that the cooperative at which level it is beneficial to operate should purchase goods was conscientiously implemented according to the law of commodity circulation. This not only encouraged the operating enthusiasm of the grassroots cooperatives, but more importantly, reduced the cost of goods, so that cheap goods could be quickly supplied to the peasants, so that the operating amount of the cooperatives could increase, and gradually achieve the goal of expanding operations and meeting the needs of residents. The mountain goods, wood, farm tools, and urban industrial products traded at the conference were directly handled by the grassroots cooperatives in the producing areas and the grassroots cooperatives in the selling areas, or by the grassroots cooperatives and state-owned companies, which greatly reduced circulation costs. For example, the base price of whetstones in Xushui was 300 yuan per jin, and when transported to the selling area of Qingyuan County, only transportation costs and a 10% management fee were added, and they were sold at 500 yuan per jin, which was still half the market price. For large commodities that grassroots cooperatives were unable to operate, the higher-level cooperatives resolutely took them over and adjusted them to ensure supply. For example, the stone inkstones produced in Xiaocun and other areas of Yixian County are of good quality and low price, and are suitable for the needs of other counties, but a village cooperative cannot buy a whole truckload. Therefore, Rongcheng and other county cooperatives organized this business according to the requirements of the village cooperatives, collected enough for a whole truck for transportation, and wholesaled it to the grassroots cooperatives in small quantities. This not only reduced costs, but also strengthened the business ties between fraternal cooperatives in neighboring areas, opening up broad avenues for supply business in the future.

A Few Experiences

I. Making full ideological preparations is the main key to holding a successful meeting. At this conference, the participating representatives were first mobilized to conscientiously study the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period, so that everyone's ideological awareness was generally improved, their work direction was clarified, and they knew the basic tasks of state-owned commerce and cooperatives during the transition period and the importance of the current grain procurement, development of production, and guarantee of supply. This enabled handicraft production cooperatives and handicraft producers to know that during the transition period, they must carry out socialist transformation through the road of organization, and at the same time pointed out the role that handicraft production cooperatives should play in supplying the means of production and means of livelihood needed by peasants. Therefore, the enthusiasm of all the representatives was unusually high, and they unanimously expressed that they would hold the meeting well under the light of the general line. The representatives of state-owned trading companies and cooperatives also consciously criticized the losses and errors caused by the lack of coordination and serious decentralism in their past work, eliminated mutual barriers and concerns, and made it possible to sign all the import contracts for major commodities in 1954 in just two days at this conference, which had not been possible for a long time. The total value of the contracted sales was 67.96544 billion yuan, accounting for 70.6 percent of the total sales at the conference. The ability to achieve such results in such a short period of time fully demonstrated the great role of the close integration of state-owned commerce and cooperatives. This not only provided direct and powerful support for the current grain procurement work and meeting the needs of the masses, but also greatly benefited the development and improvement of the business operations of state-owned commerce and cooperatives themselves, and accelerated the turnover of funds.

At the meeting, after the representatives of the handicraft production cooperatives realized the bright future of handicraft production and the importance of combining production and marketing, they also actively signed contracts with the supply and marketing cooperatives and accepted the guidance of the supply and marketing cooperatives in production, thereby opening up the sales channels for their products. For example, the Baoding City Shoe Production Cooperative had difficulty selling its products in the past because it had not contacted the supply and marketing cooperatives, so it had to go to the Northeast, Northwest and other places to promote sales; however, this time it sold 6,260 pairs, worth a total of 253.29 million yuan. Not only did it sell finished products, but it also bought back raw materials. The director of the cooperative said: "We have established supply and marketing relationships with 17 county cooperatives, and we don't have to worry about our products not being sold."

II. It is necessary to do a good job in organization and leadership, preparation work, pre-conference investigation and research work, and correct supply and marketing plans. This conference was fully prepared by the cooperatives and state-owned trading companies under the leadership of the Baoding Special District Finance Committee. The Baoding Special District Office of the Provincial Cooperative also sent people to the county and grassroots cooperatives to provide specific assistance in ideological mobilization, sample collection, plan formulation, etc., laying the ideological and material foundation for the conference. At the same time, the situation was effectively grasped during the conference, and problems were solved in a timely manner, so that everyone's thinking was clear, their steps were consistent, and their plans were well-founded, thus achieving the goal of large-scale buying and selling and basically meeting the purchasing and selling requirements of the participants.

III. Clarify the direction and purpose of the conference, and determine different contents according to different seasons and requirements. In order to fully organize the source of goods and ensure the supply of materials during the grain procurement period, this time we adopted the method of "getting to the bottom of the situation at each level and covering all the gaps at each level" for the situation of production, sales, supply, and demand, and generally achieved the satisfaction of both supply and demand parties and met the requirements. Although some existing goods were in short supply, the future production and supply and marketing were planned and combined through the signing of contracts.

Although this conference achieved many results, there are still shortcomings. The main ones are that conservative thinking and empiricism are quite serious, and there is insufficient understanding of the new situation in which a large supply of materials is needed for the current grain procurement. Therefore, the plan was set too small. Secondly, in the organization of local sources of goods, the organization work was not done well enough, so only representatives of handicraft production cooperatives participated in the meeting, and the vast number of handicraft representatives were not absorbed; and a small number of county and grassroots cooperatives lacked confidence and hesitated to try because they did not pay enough attention to the organization of local sources of goods and did not understand the situation well enough. In addition, the supply and marketing cooperatives should vigorously do a good job in the supply of means of production, which has not yet received due attention at this conference.

    保定地区合作社召开物资交流会的收获
    河北省供销合作总社
    河北省供销合作总社保定专区办事处和保定市合作总社，为了大力配合国家收购粮食作好物资供应，于一九五三年十二月初召开了以合作社为主，配合以国营贸易公司和手工业生产合作社的内部物资交流会。参加这次物资交流会的共三百四十三个单位，在六天的会期中，购销总值达一千九百三十九亿五千零九十六万元，超额完成原计划的百分之一百四十二点二；签订了供应合同一千九百九十四份。购销总额中属于生产资料的占百分之九点七；属于生活资料的占百分之九十点三。在交流的产品中，手工业和土特产品销额为八十一亿五千三百五十七万元。通过这次会议，不仅沟通了合作社与国营贸易公司、手工业生产合作社、小手工业者产供销的联系，且扩大与充实了合作社的货源，为配合粮食收购工作创造了有利的条件。
    大会主要成绩
    一、大力组织了地方货源，充实了基层社的物资力量，刺激与扶持了地方工业和手工业的发展。大会为了满足社员群众多种多样的需要，便有计划地展出了当地生产的铁木农具、小五金、家庭用具、高阳布、山货、木材、石料等三百四十四种地方产品，因此，会中突出的表现是所有代表都着重采购生产资料和地方土特产品。如涿县合作社代表团采购的小农具等地方产品达十四亿元，占其采购总金额的百分之二十，其中向七个手工业生产合作社加工订货总值六亿零九百六十三万元。涞水山区出产的各种木材、荆条，过去根本无人过问，这次会上两天就销出木柄七万根，荆条六万斤，椽子两万根，各种盖条子、义股子一千七百捆，还有大量的柿子、核桃和一部分石料。这对山区群众发展生产、改善生活都起到很大作用。据该县社主任说：“为了将这些山货运出，要吸收五千三百三十头牲口和两千六百个劳动力工作一个月，畜力和人力的收入达小米一百零四万斤。”在交流中产品销路最畅旺的是铁木业产品，据不完全统计，销出农具和小五金等工具两万四千余件，各生产单位不只把现货全部销光，而且今年第一季度的产品都被全部包了下来。如涞水城关铁业生产合作社，在大会上出售产品价值三千六百八十六万元，加上正在执行中的合同三千万元，到一九五四年四月底才能完成这批产品。该生产社还与本县、外县的许多供销合作社建立了供销关系，准备今年增设新炉两盘，发展社员八人，增加产值百分之五十，以满足各地需要。保定市织布业生产合作社因为和基层供销合作社建立了业务关系，按当地群众需要改进了产品规格、花色，因此，在这次大会上受到普遍欢迎，卖出现货和接收订货合同，共销出各种布一千三百五十八匹，总值四亿二千多万元。会议证明：只要产销见面，供销社与生产社、手工业者订立供销业务合同，不仅充实了供销社的货源，使供销业务增强计划性，且能够扶持手工业生产社、小手工业者的发展和扩大再生产，使其为国家建设与群众需要而服务。
    二、进一步贯彻了减少经营层次和大力扶持基层社发展的方针。会议成交中认真执行了按商品流转规律，那一级合作社经营有利就由那一级合作社进货的原则，不但鼓励了基层社的经营积极性，更主要的是降低了商品成本，使廉价的商品能很快供应到农民手中，使合作社经营额上升，逐步达到扩大经营、满足居民需要的目的。大会成交的山货、木材、农具和城市工业品，都是由产地基层社和销地基层社或基层社和国营公司直接见面，大大减少了流转费用。如徐水的磨刀石，底价每斤三百元，运到清苑县销地，只加运费和一成管理费用，每斤按五百元出售，还比市价低一倍。对基层社无力经营的大宗商品，上级社就坚决地包起来，进行调剂，保证供应。如易县孝村等地区出产的石砚台，质量好、价格廉，又适合外县需要，可是一个村社买不了一车，容城等县社就根据村社的要求，把这项业务组织起来，凑够整车运输，零星批发给基层社，这样，不但减低了成本，并加强了友邻区兄弟社的业务联系，给今后供应业务开辟了广阔的途径。
      几点体会
    一、充分作好思想准备，是开好会议的主要关键。这次会议上首先发动了与会代表认真地学习国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务，使大家思想觉悟普遍提高，明确了工作方向，知道了国营商业和合作社在过渡时期的基本任务和当前收购粮食、发展生产、保证供应的重要性，使手工业生产合作社和手工业生产者知道在过渡时期必须通过组织起来的道路，进行社会主义改造，同时指出手工业生产合作社在供应农民所需要的生产资料和生活资料中应起的作用。因此，全体代表情绪异常高涨，一致表示要在总路线的灯塔照耀下，把会开好。国营贸易公司与合作社的代表还自觉地批判了过去工作不协调和严重分散主义所造成的损失与错误，消除了双方的隔阂和顾虑，使以往长期订不起来的合同，在这次会议中仅两天的时间，就把一九五四年主要商品的进货合同全部签订起来。计合同销货六百七十九亿六千五百四十多万元，占大会总销货额的百分之七十点六。在这样短的时间内能取得这样的成绩，充分显示了国营商业与合作社关系密切结合的巨大作用，这不但对当前收购粮食工作、满足群众需要以直接有力的支持，同时，在国营商业、合作社本身业务开展与改善业务经营、加速资金周转上都有很大好处。
    在会议中，手工业生产合作社的代表认识到手工业生产的光明前途和生产与供销结合的重要意义后，也积极地和供销合作社订立了合同，接受供销合作社在生产上的指导，从而打开了产品的销路。如保定市鞋业生产合作社，过去因没有和供销合作社联系，产品销售不畅，只好跑到东北、西北等地去推销；而这次会议却推销了六千二百六十双，总值二亿五千三百二十九万元，不但出卖了成品，同时还买回了原料，该社主任说：“我们要和十七个县社建立了供销关系，不愁产品没销路。”
    二、必须做好组织领导与准备工作和会前的调查研究工作与正确的供销计划。这次会议，会前在保定专区财委会领导下，合作社与国营贸易公司作了充分准备，省合作社保定专区办事处并派人到县、基层社具体帮助，作好思想动员，样品搜集、制订计划等，给会议打下了思想与物质基础。同时，在会议中切实掌握情况，及时解决问题，使大家思想明确，步调一致，计划有底，因而达到了大买大卖的目的，基本上满足了与会者的购销要求。
    三、明确会议的方针和目的，根据不同季节和要求确定不同的内容。这次为了充分组织货源，保证粮食收购时期的物资供应，对产销供求情况，采取了“层层摸底，逐级兜坑”的办法，一般地达到了供求双方称意，满足了要求。虽然有些现货供不应求，但都通过签订合同，将今后的生产和供销有计划地结合起来。
    这次大会虽然获得不少成绩，但仍有缺点存在，主要是保守思想和经验主义相当严重，对于当前收购粮食需要大量物资供应的新情况认识不足，因此计划订得过小。其次在组织地方货源中，组织工作还做得不够，所以会上只有手工业生产合作社代表参加，广大的手工业代表没有被吸收；且少部分县、基层社对组织地方货源，由于不重视和了解情况不够，产生了缺乏信心和犹豫试办的态度。此外，对合作社应大力做好生产资料的供应工作，在这次会上还未引起应有的重视。
