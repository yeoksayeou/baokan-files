Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, January 22nd: To meet the rising learning demands of the Vietnamese people, publishing institutions in various parts of Vietnam have translated and published a large number of Chinese revolutionary documents under difficult conditions. These books introducing the Chinese revolutionary experience are widely circulated among the Vietnamese people. While enthusiastically studying Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet revolutionary experience, the Vietnamese people have also launched a surge of studying and researching the Chinese revolutionary experience.

From the "August Revolution" to the present, the North Vietnamese State Publishing Bureau alone has published 47 types of Chinese revolutionary documents, with a total of 193,880 copies printed. Among them, there are 17 types of Chairman Mao Zedong's works, with 57,305 copies printed.

President Ho Chi Minh is very concerned about cadres learning from the Chinese revolutionary experience. He used simple language to select and translate parts of Chinese revolutionary documents suitable for the current needs of the Vietnamese struggle. In order to help correct the subjective and one-sided thinking methods of some cadres, President Ho Chi Minh personally translated Chairman Mao Zedong's philosophical works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction."

The Vietnamese people, especially the cadres, responded to the leader's call and earnestly studied Chinese revolutionary literature.

Many cadres, after studying Chairman Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War," "The Chinese Revolution and The Chinese Community Party," "On New Democracy," and "On People's Democratic Dictatorship," unanimously stated that these brilliant works have illuminated the path of the Vietnamese people's struggle and made their eyes brighter.

"Rectification Documents" and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party" and other works are very popular among members of the Vietnamese Labor Party and government cadres, who feel that these works are of great help to their ideological transformation. Even before the Vietnamese translation of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "How to Be a Good Communist" was published, people repeatedly asked comrades who understood Chinese to interpret it to them orally.

Cadres of the Vietnamese People's Army attach particular importance to studying Chairman Mao Zedong's military theory. Many people stated at study meetings that the valuable experience gained by the Chinese People's Liberation Army with their own blood is not only a great contribution to the Chinese people, but also helps the Vietnamese national liberation struggle.

The two books published by the Vietnamese State Publishing Agency, "The Experience of the Anti-Japanese War" and "The Experience of Chinese Guerrilla Warfare," were mainly compiled based on Chairman Mao Zedong's "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" and "Strategic Problems of Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare." These two books are enthusiastically loved by the Vietnamese People's Army and the cadres who persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. Many books have been worn out due to long-term reading, but they are still reluctant to discard them and preserve them. According to a veteran Vietnamese comrade, shortly after the "August Revolution," the manuscript of "The Experience of Chinese Guerrilla Warfare" had already circulated among some cadres before the book was officially published. At that time, French imperialists were trying to reoccupy Vietnam, and the situation was changing rapidly. For a period of time, the organizational work of the Party in a certain area of ​​South Vietnam was very difficult. It was this manuscript of "The Experience of Chinese Guerrilla Warfare" that encouraged them and enabled them to persist in the local guerrilla warfare together with the local people.

In 1953, when the Vietnamese government decided to fully mobilize the masses and thoroughly implement rent reduction and interest reduction, publishing institutions in various regions printed a large number of documents on the Chinese peasant movement. Among them, Chairman Mao Zedong's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and other works have become popular learning materials for the Vietnamese people. These books have been reprinted five times in the Viet Bac Interzone and the Fourth Interzone (North Central Vietnam), but are still in short supply. In 1954, in order to welcome the upcoming land reform movement, the State Publishing Bureau translated and published Ren Bishi's "Several Problems in Land Reform," which was also warmly welcomed by the Vietnamese people.

### 中国革命文献正在越南人民中广泛传播

    中国革命文献正在越南人民中广泛传播
    【新华社北越二十二日电】越南各地的出版机构为适应越南人民高涨的学习要求，在困难的条件下大量翻译出版了中国革命文献。这些介绍中国革命经验的书籍在越南人民中普遍流传。越南人民在热烈学习马克思列宁主义和苏联革命经验的同时，也展开了学习和研究中国革命经验的热潮。
    从“八月革命”到现在，仅北越的国家出版局就出版了中国革命文献四十七种，印行十九万三千八百八十册。其中毛泽东主席的著作有十七种，印行五万七千三百零五册。
    胡志明主席非常关心干部对于中国革命经验的学习。他曾用通俗的文字选译中国革命文献中适合越南当前斗争需要的部分。为了帮助纠正有些干部的主观、片面的思想方法，胡志明主席曾亲自翻译毛泽东主席的哲学著作“实践论”和“矛盾论”。
    越南人民，尤其是干部响应了领袖的号召，认真地学习中国革命文献。
    许多干部在学习了毛泽东主席的“论持久战”、“中国革命和中国共产党”、“新民主主义论”和“论人民民主专政”等著作以后，一致认为：这些光辉的著作，照亮了越南人民斗争的道路，使他们的眼睛更加明亮了。
    “整风文献”和刘少奇同志的“论党”等著作，在越南劳动党的党员和政府干部中十分流行，他们感到这些著作对自己的思想改造有着莫大的帮助。刘少奇同志的“论共产党员的修养”一书的译本还未出版时，人们已再三要求懂中文的同志口译给大家听。
    越南人民军的干部特别重视学习毛泽东主席的军事理论，许多人在学习会上表示，中国人民解放军以自己的鲜血换取来的宝贵经验，不仅对于中国人民是很大的贡献，而且帮助了越南的民族解放斗争。
    越南的国家出版机构出版的“抗日战争的经验”和“中国游击战争的经验”两本书，主要是依据毛泽东主席的“中国革命战争的战略问题”和“抗日游击战争的战略问题”编写成的。这两本书受到越南人民军和在敌后坚持游击战争的干部们的热烈喜爱，许多书由于长久的翻阅已磨损破烂，但他们仍舍不得丢弃而保存下来。据一位越南的老同志说，“八月革命”后不久，“中国游击战争的经验”一书还未正式出版，但这本书的手抄本就已在一部分干部中流传了。当时，法帝国主义者正企图重新侵占越南，局势变化很快。有一个时期，南越某地的党的组织工作环境十分困难。正是这本“中国游击战争的经验”的手抄本鼓舞了他们，使他们和当地人民一起坚持了当地的游击战争。
    一九五三年，当越南政府决定全面发动群众、彻底实现减租减息后，各地出版机构大量印行了中国农民运动方面的文献。其中如毛泽东主席的“中国社会各阶级的分析”和“湖南农民运动考察报告”等著作，已成为越南人民普遍的学习材料。这些书在越北联区和第四联区（中越北部）虽已再版五次，仍供不应求。在一九五四年，为了迎接即将开始的土地改革运动，国家出版局已翻译出版了任弼时的“土地改革中的几个问题”，同样受到越南人民的热烈欢迎。
