The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a directive on the 21st, requiring trade union organizations at all levels nationwide to thoroughly publicize the significant meaning of the government issuing bonds to the broad masses of workers and staff, mobilize workers and staff to enthusiastically subscribe to bonds, and actively assist the government in doing a good job in publicizing and promoting bonds among the capitalists (or owners) of private industrial and commercial enterprises and the capitalists of joint state-private enterprises.

The directive stated: Trade union organizations at all levels should, in accordance with the spirit of the "Directive of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the Issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds," and in conjunction with the ongoing education on the general line of the state's transition period, vigorously publicize the political and economic significance of issuing bonds and the methods of issuing bonds to the broad masses of workers and staff, so that all workers and staff universally recognize that this year is the second year of the first five-year plan implemented by our country in order to gradually transition to a socialist society. Completing this year's national plan is of great significance both for the country's prosperity and for the people's welfare. Issuing bonds is one of the important methods for raising funds needed for national economic construction. Subscribing to bonds is not only an economic support for the motherland's construction, but also a patriotic manifestation in politics. The lives of the working class have improved somewhat in recent years. It is entirely possible for them to use part of their income or savings to subscribe to bonds and support the country's socialist construction based on their own economic conditions. Therefore, our working class should firmly support the government's measures to issue construction bonds and enthusiastically subscribe to bonds.

The directive pointed out: In recent years, due to the leadership of the state-owned economy and the active labor of the broad masses of workers and staff, all private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have achieved considerable development, especially those enterprises that have implemented joint state-private ownership, which have shown a thriving scene. Trade union organizations at all levels must pay attention to combining this situation, explaining the policies and methods of issuing construction bonds to the broad masses of workers and staff in private and joint state-private enterprises, calling on them to not only enthusiastically subscribe to bonds themselves, but also actively promote capitalists to respond to the government's call, complete the amount of bonds that the state promotes to private industrial and commercial enterprises and the private side of joint state-private enterprises, and pay attention to supervising and preventing some private industrialists and businessmen from apportioning the bonds they should subscribe to their employees, calculating the amount purchased by the employees under their own names, and using the purchase of bonds as an excuse to evade taxes or disperse funds in disguise, and other illegal acts of harming the public and benefiting themselves.

The directive requires trade union organizations at all levels to select appropriate cadres to participate in the work of the local bond promotion committee. Trade union cadres participating in this work must obey the assignment, learn the policies well, and actively complete the task.

    全国总工会指示各级工会做好公债推销工作
    中华全国总工会二十一日发出指示，要求全国各级工会组织很好地向广大职工宣传政府发行公债的重大意义，动员职工踊跃认购公债，并积极协助政府在私营工商业的资方（或业主）与公私合营的资方中间做好公债的宣传和推销工作。
    指示说：工会各级组织应根据“中央人民政府政务院关于发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债的指示”的精神，结合目前正在进行着的国家过渡时期总路线的教育，向广大职工大力宣传发行公债的政治意义和经济意义以及公债发行办法，使所有职工都普遍认识：今年是我国为了逐步过渡到社会主义社会而实行的第一个五年计划的第二年度，完成今年的国家计划，无论对于国家的富强或对于人民的福利都是有重大意义的。发行公债是筹集国家经济建设所需资金的重要方法之一。认购公债不仅是在经济上支援祖国建设，而且在政治上也是一种爱国主义的表现。工人阶级几年来的生活已有所改善，根据自己的经济条件拿出一部分收入或积蓄来认购公债，支持国家的社会主义建设，是完全可能的。因此，我们工人阶级应当坚决拥护政府发行建设公债的措施，踊跃认购公债。
    指示指出：几年来，由于国营经济的领导和广大职工的积极劳动，一切有利于国计民生的私营工商业都获得了相当的发展，尤其是实行了公私合营的企业，更呈现了欣欣向荣的气象。工会各级组织，必须注意结合这一情况，将发行建设公债的政策和办法向私营和公私合营企业的广大职工交代清楚，号召他们除了自己踊跃认购公债外，应当积极推动资方响应政府号召，完成认购国家向私营工商业及公私合营企业的私方推销的公债数额，并注意监督和防止某些私营工商业者将自己应该认购的公债分摊给职工，将职工购买的数额算在自己名下，以及以购买公债为借口逃脱税收或变相分散资金等损公利私的非法行为。
    指示要求工会各级组织选派适当干部参加当地的公债推销委员会的工作。参加这一工作的工会干部，必须服从分配，学好政策，积极地完成任务。
