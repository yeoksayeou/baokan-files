Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 19th: Just as the U.S. military, colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the Syngman Rhee clique, is actively arranging to seize more than 22,000 of our side's prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated on January 23, the U.S. side's Senior Member of the Military Armistice Commission, Lacey, sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the 18th, falsely accusing our side of violating the armistice agreement and detaining prisoners of war, and requesting the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to send neutral nations inspection teams to conduct investigations. Because the content of Lacey's letter of accusation was inconsistent with the provisions of the armistice agreement, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission discussed it at the meeting on the 19th and did not send a team to investigate the accusation as requested by the U.S. side.

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, Senior Member of the Korean and Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, sent a letter to Lacey on the 19th to protest this matter, pointing out that the U.S. side's accusation was completely groundless and a complete fabrication and slander. The Korean and Chinese side has always strictly implemented the armistice agreement and has never detained prisoners of war. Moreover, there are no units with those serial numbers as alleged by the U.S. side.

    It is known to all that it is the U.S. side that has violated the armistice agreement and forcibly detained prisoners of war on a large scale. The U.S. side's current clumsy and ridiculous fabrication and false accusation is only intended to cover up its conspiracy to once again seize our side's prisoners of war in the near future. Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho finally emphasized that the U.S. side's attempt is doomed to fail, the U.S. side's crime of forcibly detaining our side's prisoners of war cannot be covered up, and the U.S. side must bear the responsibility for all serious consequences arising therefrom.
   
Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 20th: The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission today rejected the U.S. side's request to dispatch mobile neutral nations inspection teams to investigate the slanderous accusation that the Korean and Chinese side forcibly detained prisoners of war. The alternate members from Czechoslovakia and Poland pointed out during the discussion that the U.S. side's request was not in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement. Article 28 of the armistice agreement stipulates that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission shall, at the request of the Military Armistice Commission or any of its senior members, "conduct special observation and inspection at locations outside the Demilitarized Zone where violations of this Armistice Agreement are reported to have occurred." The U.S. side still failed to clarify the location where the violation of the armistice agreement occurred after adjourning yesterday, while the letter from the Korean and Chinese side had already pointed out that the units of the Korean and Chinese forces mentioned in the U.S. side's accusatory letter did not exist at all. Since the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has not obtained from the U.S. side the location to be investigated, it cannot send out an inspection team, let alone send out a team without a specific workplace to search for non-existent troops.

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, Senior Member of the Korean and Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, pointed out in yesterday's letter that the U.S. side's current clumsy, ridiculous, and slanderous accusations are aimed at playing tricks on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to realize its conspiracy to deceive the people of the world and forcibly detain prisoners of war.

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho further pointed out that the U.S. side has openly and on a large scale forcibly detained our side's prisoners of war and incorporated them into the U.S. military in several cases: more than 27,000 people from June to August 1952; more than 11,000 people in October 1952; and more than 27,000 people in June 1953. The number of our side's prisoners of war who have been forcibly detained by the U.S. side with names and surnames alone is 98,742. Our side submitted the list of these prisoners of war on September 21, 1953, but the U.S. side has so far failed to give a responsible explanation.

    In fact, the Korean and Chinese side has grasped full and concrete evidence of the U.S. side's forced incorporation of our side's prisoners of war into the Syngman Rhee army and its coercion of them to act as secret agents. The U.S. side is detaining hundreds of our side's prisoners of war on Seon Gap Island southwest of Incheon and is forcing them to undergo special agent training. Even within the U.S.-Syngman Rhee Ministry of National Defense, our side's prisoners of war are still being detained. Now, the U.S. side is transferring 22,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in Dongchang-ri to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek to serve as cannon fodder. The U.S. side's current slanderous accusation against the Korean and Chinese side is obviously an attempt to divert people's attention in order to cover up its criminal acts of forcibly detaining prisoners of war and handing them over to the Chiang-Rhee bandit gangs.

    美方为了掩盖劫夺战俘的罪行又反诬我方扣留战俘
    我方指出美方绝不能掩盖劫夺战俘的罪行
    中立国监察委员会拒绝了美方的诬蔑性指控
   【新华社开城十九日电】正当美军勾结蒋介石残余匪帮和李承晚集团积极布置在一月二十三日劫夺二万二千余名不直接遣返的我方被俘人员的时候，军事停战委员会美方首席委员拉西在十八日致函中立国监察委员会诬指我方违反停战协定、扣留战俘，并要求中立国监察委员会派遣中立国视察小组进行调查。由于拉西这封指控信的内容和停战协定的规定不相符合，中立国监察委员会在十九日的会上进行了讨论，没有依照美方要求派遣小组就这一指控进行调查。
    军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将特就此事于十九日致函拉西提出抗议，指出美方这一指控毫无事实根据，彻头彻尾是捏造和诬蔑，朝中方面向来严格执行停战协定，从未扣留战俘，而且根本就没有美方指控中所称的那些番号的部队。
    举世皆知：违反停战协定，大规模强迫扣留战俘的正是美方。美方现在作出这样拙劣可笑的捏造和诬控，其目的只是为了掩盖其准备在最近又一次劫夺我方被俘人员的阴谋。李相朝中将最后着重指出：美方这一企图是注定要失败的，美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪行是无法掩盖的，美方必须负担由此而产生的一切严重后果的责任。
   【新华社开城二十日电】中立国监察委员会今天拒绝了美方关于派遣机动中立国视察小组对所谓朝中方面强迫扣留战俘的诬蔑性指控进行调查的请求。捷克斯洛伐克和波兰的候补委员在讨论中指出：美方的请求是不符合停战协定的规定的。停战协定第二十八款规定：中立国监察委员会应根据军事停战委员会或其中任何一方首席委员的请求，“至非军事区以外据报发生违反本停战协定事件的地点进行特别观察与视察”。美方在昨天休会后仍然没有对发生违反停战协定事件的地点加以澄清，而朝中方面的来信已经指出，美方指控信中所述的朝中部队的单位根本不存在。中立国监察委员会既没有从美方获得应前往进行调查的地点，当然不能派出视察小组，更不能派出一个没有具体工作地点的小组，去找寻并不存在的部队。
    军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在昨天的信中就已经指出：美方现在作出这样拙劣可笑和诬蔑性的指控，其目的就是在玩弄中立国监察委员会，以实现其欺骗世界人民、强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。
  李相朝将军进一步指出：仅仅美方公开大规模地强迫扣留我方被俘人员，并将他们编入美方军队的就有好几起：一九五二年六月至八月，二万七千余人；一九五二年十月，一万一千余人；一九五三年六月，二万七千余人。仅仅有名有姓的我方被俘人员被美方强迫扣留的就有九万八千七百四十二人。我方已在一九五三年九月二十一日提出了这些战俘的名单，但美方至今仍未能作出负责的交代。
    事实上，朝中方面对美方强迫把我方被俘人员编入李承晚军队，以及胁迫他们充当特务的事实，已掌握有充分的具体的证据。美方在仁川西南的仙甲岛上就扣留着数百名我方被俘人员，并且强迫对他们进行特务训练。甚至在美方李承晚国防部内，都还扣留有我方被俘人员。现在，美方正在把东场里的二万二千名朝中战俘移交给李承晚和蒋介石充当炮灰。美方现在提出这一对朝中方面的诬蔑性指控，显然是企图转移人们的注意，以便于掩饰其强迫扣留战俘并把他们移交给李蒋匪帮的罪恶行为。
