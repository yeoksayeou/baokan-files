Xinhua News Agency, January 12th:

    In 1953, ethnic minority areas across the country further promoted ethnic regional autonomy, consolidating the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all ethnic groups.

    Over the past year, seven autonomous regions at the prefecture level have been successively established in minority areas. These are: Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, Tibetan Autonomous Region in Sichuan Province, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region in Gansu Province, Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region in Gansu Province, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region in Qinghai Province, and Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Region in Qinghai Province. These autonomous regions are distributed in the remote areas of Southwest and Northwest China, including nearly two million people from various ethnic groups such as Dai, Jingpo, Tibetan, and Hui. Many county-level and sub-county-level autonomous regions have also been established in various places. To date, there are forty-eight autonomous regions at or above the county level nationwide, including the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which was established earliest and has the largest area, and the Guangxi Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the province with the largest ethnic minority population. Tens of millions of ethnic minority people have already enjoyed the right to ethnic regional autonomy.

    All ethnic autonomous regions were established under the specific leadership and assistance of local Chinese Communist Party organizations and people's governments at all levels, based on the wishes of the local people of all ethnic groups and leaders with ties to the people, and after full consultation and discussion. The Yunnan Provincial People's Government sent ethnic work teams to the southern and western borders very early to help prepare for the establishment of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region and the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region. Before the establishment of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Gansu Provincial People's Government sent a large number of cadres of Tibetan, Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups to participate in the preparatory work. The Northwest Administrative Committee also organized a visiting delegation to visit Zhuoni, Lintan, and other areas inhabited by Tibetan people, extensively soliciting the opinions of people from all walks of life, effectively promoting the establishment of the autonomous region.

    All ethnic autonomous regions have vigorously cultivated ethnic minority cadres, used ethnic minority languages and scripts, and appropriately applied ethnic forms to manage the affairs of their own ethnic groups, so that autonomous organs have gradually become ethnicized. The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province has systematically trained mass activists, patriotic intellectuals, and leaders with ties to the masses. Now, ethnic minority cadres account for more than 60% of all cadres in the region, and Dai and Han languages are used as tools for exercising functions and powers in the autonomous organs. Various ethnic groups are able to respect each other and consult on matters, so that many problems are quickly resolved. In the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region of Gansu Province, the religious beliefs and customs of the Hui people are respected, and many advanced elements and religious figures participate in the work of people's governments at all levels. The gradual ethnicization of autonomous organs has further strengthened ethnic unity and close ties between the autonomous organs and the people of all ethnic groups.

    The superiority of the ethnic regional autonomy system has been fully demonstrated in various ethnic autonomous regions. The patriotism of the people of all ethnic groups has been greatly enhanced, the unity of all ethnic groups has been strengthened, and many new atmospheres have emerged in various places. In the Guangtong Hui Autonomous Region of Gansu Province, which was established last September, the Hui people paid public grain in a very short period of time, and repaid all agricultural loans due to the state, supporting industrial construction. The Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region publicized ethnic policies in pastoral areas through various meetings and organized visiting delegations, and resolved many historical disputes, large and small, through consultation and mediation. In the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region of Gansu Province, due to the mutual assistance and unity of the Hui and Han people, they jointly repaired canals, dug wells, and rushed to plant autumn fields, overcoming the severe drought last year. In the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province, the Dai people in the plains welcomed the Aini people in the mountains to come down to the dam area for production, and helped each other improve production technology, resulting in new ethnic relations that had never existed in history.

    The political, economic, and cultural development of the ethnic autonomous regions has also flourished, and the face of many barren mountainous areas is gradually changing. For example, in the Lancang Lahu Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province, on the southern border of the motherland, people used to live in extreme poverty. Last year, the autonomous region government provided loans and grain, and issued special funds for water conservancy, leading the people to build more than 400 small canals, expand the planting area of rice and dry rice, and increase rice production by 9.5 million catties, initially overcoming the farmers' lack of food. People's governments at all levels in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region have led people of all ethnic groups to develop animal husbandry production. Now, the average number of livestock of all kinds has increased by more than 70% compared to before liberation. The number of schools in various autonomous regions has gradually increased, and the excellent cultural heritage of the people of all ethnic groups has been respected. The Dai script of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region has been improved with the help of the People's Government. The number of primary schools in the region has increased to more than 110, and two new ethnic middle schools have been established, with the number of students increasing more than nine times compared to the early days of liberation. In the past, diseases were rampant and the population declined in many ethnic areas. Thanks to the development of health and medical work, the health of the people of all ethnic groups has been initially guaranteed. In the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, in addition to the establishment of more than 20 medical institutions at all levels and a leprosarium, more than 500 health and medical workers conducted mobile medical services in the alpine grasslands. According to statistics last spring, more than 100,000 adults and children have been vaccinated against smallpox or injected with vaccines.

    Over the past year, in areas implementing ethnic regional autonomy, the people of all ethnic groups have realized the right to manage the affairs of their own ethnic groups, and they have established new lives under the leadership of the people's governments at higher levels. With the steady implementation of the policy of ethnic regional autonomy, the unity of all ethnic groups in the country will be further consolidated, and all ethnic minorities will achieve greater development and progress.

    各少数民族地区稳步推行民族区域自治
    全国各民族团结更加巩固
    【新华社十二日讯】全国各少数民族地区在一九五三年内，进一步推行了民族区域自治，巩固了祖国的统一和各民族的团结。
    一年来，在少数民族地区，先后建立了七个相当于专区级的自治区，即：云南省西双版纳傣族自治区、云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区、四川省藏族自治区、甘肃省甘南藏族自治区、甘肃省西海固回族自治区、青海省海南藏族自治区和青海省黄南藏族自治区。这些自治区分布在祖国西南和西北的边远地区，包括傣、景颇、藏、回等各民族的人口近二百万。各地还建立了很多县级和县级以下的自治区。至此，全国已有四十八个相当于县级和县级以上的自治区，其中包括成立最早、幅员辽阔的内蒙古自治区和人口最多的广西省桂西僮族自治区。上千万的少数民族人民，已经享受到民族区域自治的权利。
    各民族自治区都是在各地中国共产党组织、各级人民政府的具体领导和帮助下，根据当地各族人民和与人民有联系的领袖人物的志愿，经过充分协商讨论以后建立的。云南省人民政府很早以前就派出民族工作队，分赴南部和西部边境，帮助筹备建立西双版纳傣族自治区和德宏傣族景颇族自治区。甘南藏族自治区在未建立以前，中共甘肃省委员会和甘肃省人民政府，曾派了大批藏、回、汉等族的干部去参加筹备工作，西北行政委员会并组织访问团，到藏族人民聚居的卓尼、临潭等地访问，广泛征求各阶层人士的意见，有效地促进了自治区的建立。
    各民族自治区曾大力培养民族干部，使用民族语言文字，并适当地运用民族形式来管理本民族的事务，使自治机关逐渐民族化。云南省西双版纳傣族自治区有计划地培养群众积极分子、爱国知识分子和与群众有联系的领袖人物。现在全区少数民族干部已占全体干部的百分之六十以上，自治机关中采用傣文和汉文为行使职权的工具。各民族间并能互相尊重、遇事协商，使许多问题很快得到解决。在甘肃省西海固回族自治区，回族的宗教信仰和风俗习惯都得到尊重，许多先进分子、宗教界人士等参加各级人民政府工作。自治机关的逐步民族化，更加强了民族团结，密切了自治机关和各族人民的联系。
    民族区域自治制度的优越性，已在各个民族自治区充分地显示出来。各民族人民的爱国主义思想大大提高，各族人民加强了团结，各地出现了许多新气象。在去年九月成立的甘肃省广通回族自治区，回族人民在很短时间内就缴纳了公粮，并把到期的农业贷款全部归还国家，支援工业建设。甘南藏族自治区通过各种会议和组织访问团深入牧区宣传民族政策，以协商和调解方式，解决了很多历史上遗留下来的大小纠纷。甘肃省西海固回族自治区由于回、汉族人民互助团结，共同修渠、打井，抢种秋田，战胜了去年严重的旱灾。在云南省西双版纳傣族自治区，平坝地区的傣族人民欢迎山区的爱尼族人民下坝生产，并互相帮助，改进生产技术，出现了历史上从未有过的新的民族关系。
    各民族自治区的政治、经济、文化也得到了蓬勃的发展，很多贫瘠的山区面貌已在逐渐改观。如在祖国南部边疆的云南省澜沧拉祜族自治区，过去人民生活十分贫苦，去年自治区人民政府贷款贷粮，并发放水利专款，领导人民兴修了四百多条小型水渠，扩大了水稻、旱稻的栽种面积，增产稻谷九百五十万斤，初步克服了农民缺少食粮的困难。海南藏族自治区各级人民政府，领导各族人民发展畜牧业生产，现在各种牲畜平均已比解放前增殖了百分之七十以上。各自治区的学校已逐渐增多，各民族人民优秀的文化遗产受到了尊重。德宏傣族景颇族自治区的傣族文字，在人民政府的帮助下已得到改进。全区小学校已发展到一百一十多所，并新建立了两所民族中学，学生人数比解放初期增加了九倍多。很多民族地区过去疾病蔓延，人口下降，由于卫生医疗工作的开展，各族人民的健康已初步得到了保障。在四川省藏族自治区，除已建立各级医疗机构二十多处和一座麻疯病院外，曾有五百多名卫生医疗工作人员，在高山草地进行巡回医疗。据去年春天统计，已有十万多成年人和儿童接种了牛痘或注射防疫针。
    一年来，在实行民族区域自治的地区，各族人民已经实现了管理本民族事务的权利，他们在上级人民政府的领导下建立了新的生活。随着民族区域自治政策的稳步推行，全国各民族的团结将更加巩固，各少数民族将获得更大的发展和进步。
