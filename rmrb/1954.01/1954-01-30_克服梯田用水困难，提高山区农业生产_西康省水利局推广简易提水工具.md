To overcome the difficulties of water use in terraced fields and improve agricultural production in mountainous areas, the Xikang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau is promoting simple water-lifting tools.

In recent years, many small-scale farmland water conservancy projects have been built and renovated in rural areas of Xikang Province, ensuring that agricultural production is less threatened by drought, and thus the yield of food crops has increased every year. However, in some areas, water sources are low, and many terraced fields have difficulty accessing water. In order to gradually change this situation and help farmers in these areas develop agricultural production, the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry has decided, based on actual needs and possible conditions, to first trial-produce and promote simple water-lifting tools such as dragon bone waterwheels, bamboo tube waterwheels, and bamboo tube water pumps in eleven counties, including Ya'an, Yingjing, Hanyuan, Shimian, Tianquan, Luding, Xichang, Mianning, Yuexi, Huili, and Miyi, in order to gradually solve the difficulty of farmland water use in these areas. The structures of these simple water-lifting tools are very simple, and the materials (wood and bamboo) are also relatively cheap. Last year, the province had already exhibited and experimented with them in many places, and farmers in some areas have already adopted them. Generally, they can lift water to a height of five or six meters, and the efficiency of irrigating fields is much higher than using water ladles. In order to help farmers in various counties obtain materials locally and learn how to manufacture these tools, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau also plans to first organize carpenters from various counties to learn manufacturing methods, and then gradually promote them using the method of master teaching apprentices.

In addition, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has decided to install a twelve-horsepower water pump in Xiangyang Village, Lushan County, this year. After damming and storing water at Yuanjiashan in Xichang County and further expanding the water source, it is planned to install a sixty-horsepower water pump. These two demonstration projects are estimated to solve the water use problem for more than 2,700 mu of farmland. In addition, it is planned to hold a demonstration project of water lifting with a twenty-four-horsepower water pump at the Kangding Xinduqiao Farm. In order to carry out water lifting and irrigation work in a planned and step-by-step manner, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has now established a water lifting tool demonstration station, which is specifically responsible for the promotion and demonstration of water lifting tools.

　　克服梯田用水困难，提高山区农业生产
　　西康省水利局推广简易提水工具
    几年来，西康省农村中兴修、整修了很多农田小型水利，保证了农业生产少受干旱的威胁，因而每年粮食作物产量都获得增产。但是，有的地区因为水源低，有很多梯田梯地用水困难。为了逐步改变这种情况，帮助这些地区的农民发展农业生产，省人民政府农林厅水利局，根据实际需要和可能的条件，决定今年首先在雅安、荥经、汉源、石棉、天全、泸定、西昌、冕宁、越嶲、会理、米易等十一县，试制和推广龙骨车、竹筒水车和竹筒水泵等简易提水工具，以逐步解决这些地区农田用水的困难。这些简易提水工具的构造很简单，材料（木头和竹子）也比较便宜。去年该省已经在很多地方展览和实验过，有的地区农民已经采用了，一般可以把水提到五、六公尺高，并且灌田的效率也比用戽水篼戽水高得多。省水利局为了帮助各县农民就地取材，学会制造这些工具，还计划先组织各县木工学习制造方法，然后以师傅带徒弟的办法，逐步推广。
    另外，省水利局决定今年在芦山县向阳村装置十二匹马力的抽水机。在西昌县袁家山堵坝蓄水，进一步扩大水源后，准备装置六十匹马力的抽水机。此两处示范工程，估计可解决二千七百多亩农田的用水问题。此外，并计划在康定新都桥农场，举办二十四匹马力抽水机提水的示范工程。为了有计划、有步骤地开展提水灌溉工作，该省水利局现在已经成立了提水工具示范站，专门负责提水工具的推广和示范工作。
