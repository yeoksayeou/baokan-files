Reader's Letters Abstract

    Let the "Dongting" Dredger Participate in the Motherland's Water Conservancy Construction as Soon as Possible

    Reader Ding Qi writes: Near the May First Pier in Changsha City, there is a blue-gray dredger named "Dongting" moored. This ship has been docked here for about a year, and it has never worked; even when the project of repairing and harnessing South Dongting Lake was in full swing, it did not dredge an inch of mud or a piece of soil. Due to long-term erosion by wind and rain and exposure to the sun, the paint on this dredger has peeled off, and the iron frame has rusted!

    Why is this dredger always moored and not participating in work? I went to inquire about it. It turns out that the "Dongting" dredger is a "cutter-suction" type, which is only suitable for dredging hard sand and sludge; however, the places that need to be dredged in Hunan's inland rivers are all floating sand or hard mud. If a "cutter" is used to dredge floating sand, the floating sand will scatter; if a "cutter" is used to dredge hard mud, the "cutter" will be blocked.

    The Hunan Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau spent 4 billion RMB in 1952 to order this "Dongting" dredger. At that time, why didn't they study the local specific conditions? After they knew that this ship could not be used locally, why would they rather pay more than 50 million yuan per month in management fees than request to be transferred to a place where it could be used? It is suggested that the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central Government handle this issue so that the "Dongting" dredger can play its due role in the motherland's water conservancy construction as soon as possible.

### 让洞庭号挖泥船早日参加祖国的水利建设

专栏：读者来信摘要

    让洞庭号挖泥船早日参加祖国的水利建设
    读者丁琦来信：长沙市五一码头的附近，停着一艘蓝灰色的洞庭号挖泥船。这艘船停泊在这里有一年光景了，从来就没有工作过；修治南洞庭湖的工程进行得热火朝天的时候，它也没有去挖一寸泥一片土。由于长期的风雨侵蚀、阳光曝晒，这艘挖泥船的油漆已经剥落，铁架也生锈了！
    为什么这艘挖泥船老是停泊着而不去参加工作呢？我就去打听了一下。原来洞庭号挖泥船是“绞刀式”的，只适宜用来挖硬沙和污泥；可是湖南内河需要修浚的地方都是浮沙或硬泥。用“绞刀”挖浮沙，浮沙就散走了；用“绞刀”挖硬泥，“绞刀”就要被塞住。
    湖南省人民政府水利局在一九五二年花了四十亿人民币订造这艘洞庭号挖泥船。当时，为什么他们不研究一下当地具体情况呢？在他们知道这艘船在当地不能使用以后，又为什么宁愿每月支付五千多万元的管理费用，而不请求调拨到能用的地方去呢？建议中央水利部处理这个问题，使洞庭号挖泥船能够早日为祖国的水利建设发挥应有的作用。
