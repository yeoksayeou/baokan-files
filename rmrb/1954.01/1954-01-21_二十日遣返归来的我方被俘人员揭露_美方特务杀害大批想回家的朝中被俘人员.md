    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 20th.
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war repatriated today revealed that Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents have openly announced that they will kill a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who want to go home. Some prisoners of war have already been killed by special agents.
    Repatriated to Panmunjom today were three Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who escaped from the camp before the prisoners of war were handed over to the U.S. side, eighteen Korean People's Army prisoners of war who testified on the case of special agents killing prisoners of war in Camp No. 38, and another Korean People's Army prisoner of war, Kim Hyung-soo.
    Kim Hyung-soo, a returnee, said that starting on the 14th of this month, the Syngman Rhee special agents in Camp No. 45 began to "investigate" the prisoners of war who had expressed their desire to be repatriated. The special agents brought these prisoners of war one by one into the "battalion headquarters" according to the blacklist, beat them with wooden sticks, and forced them to swear to go to South Korea with the special agents. On the evening of the 15th, Kim Hyung-soo and Kim Seong-hwan were taken in for "investigation" together. Kim Seong-hwan was beaten all over his body by special agents with sticks and bled from his mouth because he expressed his unwillingness to go to South Korea as cannon fodder. Kim Seong-hwan died the next day. Kim Hyung-soo personally saw several people carrying his body and digging a hole in the "church" on the ground in the camp to bury him. That night, a prisoner of war secretly ran to tell Kim Hyung-soo that he had heard that the special agents had decided to kill Kim Hyung-soo and several other people who had been "investigated" in the next few days. Kim Hyung-soo risked his life to climb out of the barbed wire that night.
    Kim Hyung-soo said that from the 14th to the 16th, in addition to Kim Seong-hwan being killed, at least seven people were severely beaten and detained by special agents. One of them, Choi Il-beom, had his lower limbs broken and could not move. When the special agents kidnapped the prisoners of war to the south, these people would be killed.
    Lu Haiqing, a returnee from the Volunteer Army, said that the Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the camp have concentrated many prisoners of war who want to return to their country under control. Each squadron has established a so-called "backward elements squad," which is specially guarded by "security guards" with knives. The special agent leader openly announced that when escorting the prisoners of war to the south, each monitored prisoner of war would be escorted by two "security guards" with knives. If they could be taken away, they would be taken away; if they could not be taken away, they would be stabbed to death. The special agents also said: "There are American soldiers everywhere outside the barbed wire. It doesn't matter if we kill a hundred or so."
    The eighteen Korean People's Army prisoners of war who testified on the case of the four prisoners of war killed in Camp No. 38 today made detailed accusations at Panmunjom about the special agents' brutal killing of the four prisoners of war who requested repatriation.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 20th. On the eve of the U.S. side forcibly detaining prisoners of war, the lights in the tents of the Dongchang-ri prisoner of war camp were on all night. Special agents and U.S. and Rhee troops in the prisoner of war camp were completing the final preparations for detaining prisoners of war.
    On the evening of the 19th, the civil police of our side in the demilitarized zone heard screams from Camp No. 15 in Dongchang-ri, and then there was silence. Recently returned prisoners of war said that the special agents had been ordered to kill all the "unstable elements" who had revealed their intention to return home before leaving Dongchang-ri. Various camps were setting fire to burn certain things, and the fire did not mostly extinguish until 2:30 a.m. on the 20th.
    On the evening of the 19th, on the railway on the left side of Hill 155 controlled by the U.S. side, the train head was spewing thick smoke and sparks, and honking from time to time. At 8:00 p.m., sixteen cars drove into the prisoner of war camp area and parked near the U.S. 64th Field Hospital. At 8:30 p.m., another car crossed Hill 155 and stopped at the water tower on the hillside. U.S. and Rhee army armed personnel, spread all over the narrow strip of land between the military demarcation line and the Dongchang-ri prisoner of war camp, were also ambushing in the hills and bushes, communicating with each other by walkie-talkies and talking machines, preparing to shoot and kill Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who might escape north.
    After the night fog rose, the special agents in Camp No. 18 fired a flare, and the U.S. and Rhee troops in the Hill 155 area immediately launched many red and white flares and flash bombs to direct the special agents in the camp to carry out activities. The prisoners of war in Camps No. 32, 33, 34, and 36 were forced to shout and scream by special agents. That night, there were frequent gunshots behind Hill 155, and the war atmosphere created by the U.S. and Rhee troops shrouded the entire Dongchang-ri prisoner of war camp.
    At 2:00 a.m. on the 20th, each camp gathered for meals. At 3:00 a.m., the bugles of each camp began to emit a shrill and monotonous sound, ordering the prisoners of war to put on their backpacks and assemble. The time for the American aggressors to extend their bloody claws to more than 22,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war was approaching.

    二十日遣返归来的我方被俘人员揭露
    美方特务杀害大批想回家的朝中被俘人员
   【新华社开城二十日电】今天遣返归来的我方被俘人员揭露：李承晚和蒋匪帮特务已公然宣布要大批杀害想回家的朝中战俘。有的战俘已经被特务杀死了。
    今天遣返到板门店的有三名在战俘被交给美方前夕逃出营场的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，十八名为第三十八号营场特务杀害战俘案作证的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，和另一名朝鲜人民军被俘人员金亨洙。
  归来人员金亨洙说，从本月十四日起，第四十五号营场的李承晚特务开始“审查”曾流露过想遣返的愿望的战俘，特务们按照黑名单把这些战俘一个个带进“大队部”，用木棒殴打他们，强迫他们宣誓跟特务们一起到南朝鲜去。十五日晚上，金亨洙和金成焕一同被带进去“审查”。金成焕因表示不愿意到南朝鲜当炮灰，被特务用棒子打得遍身是伤，口中流血，第二天，金成焕就死了，金亨洙亲眼看见几个人抬着他的尸首在营场内“教堂”地上挖坑埋掉。这天晚上，有一个战俘偷偷跑来告诉金亨洙说，他听见特务们已决定把金亨洙和另外几个受过“审查”的人在这几天内杀掉。金亨洙当夜即冒着生命危险翻出了铁丝网。
    金亨洙说，从十四日到十六日，除金成焕被杀外，至少有七个人遭到毒打并被特务关了起来，其中有一个叫崔日范的战俘，下肢已被打断，不能走动。当特务们劫持战俘南行时，这些人就都会被杀死。
    志愿军归来人员陆海清说，营场里的蒋匪特务已将许多想回国的战俘集中管制起来，每一个中队都成立了一个所谓“落后分子小队”，专门由带着刀子的“警备队员”看守着。特务头子公开宣布，在挟持战俘南行时，每一个被监视的战俘将由两个带刀子的“警备队员”押解，能带走就带走，不能带走就一刀把他刺死。特务还说：“一出铁丝网都是美军，杀死百把个没有关系。”
    为三十八号营场四名战俘被杀案作证的十八名朝鲜人民军被俘人员，今日在板门店又详细控诉了特务残杀四名要求遣返的战俘的情形。
   【新华社开城二十日电】在美方强迫扣留战俘的前夕，东场里战俘营帐篷中的灯光通宵未熄。战俘营中的特务分子和美、李军都在完成扣留战俘的最后准备工作。
    十九日晚上，非军事区内的我方民政警察听见东场里十五号营场中发出凄厉的惨叫声，以后又寂然无声。最近归来的被俘人员曾说，特务已奉命在离开东场里前把透露回国意愿的“不稳分子”都杀掉。各营场都在纵火焚烧某些东西，大火到二十日晨二时半才大部熄灭。
    十九日晚上，在美方控制的一五五高地左侧的铁路上，火车头喷着浓烟和火星，不时长鸣。晚八时，有十六辆汽车开进战俘营区，停在美军第六十四野战医院附近。八时半，又有一辆汽车翻过一五五高地，停在半山的水塔处。满布在军事分界线与东场里战俘营之间狭长地带的美李军武装人员，也埋伏在小丘和草丛中用步行机、对话机互相联系，准备枪杀可能向北逃跑的朝中战俘。
    在夜雾升起以后，第十八号营场中的特务打出一枚信号弹，一五五高地一带的美、李军，立即发射出很多颗红色、白色的信号弹和闪光弹，指挥营场内的特务进行活动。第三十二、三十三、三十四、三十六号营场的战俘，被特务强迫着狂呼狂叫。这一夜，一五五高地后面经常有枪声，美、李军制造的战争气氛笼罩着整个东场里战俘营。
    在二十日清晨二时，各营场便集合吃饭。三时，各营场的军号开始发出凄厉而单调的号音，指挥战俘背上背包集合。美国侵略者向二万二千多名朝中被俘人员伸出血腥魔爪的时间快到来了。
