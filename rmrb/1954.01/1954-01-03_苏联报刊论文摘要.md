    Make Newspapers and Magazines Reach the Masses

      The "Pravda" published an editorial on November 13, 1953, pointing out the significant political importance of newspaper and magazine distribution work. The abstract is as follows:

    Soviet newspapers and magazines are a new type of publication and a powerful tool for the communist education of the working people. All activities of our newspapers and magazines follow the Communist Party's policies, which represent the vital interests of the people. High ideological content, correctness, and an inseparable connection with the people are the characteristics of Soviet newspapers and magazines.

    Today, as the Soviet people are striving tenaciously for abundant domestic food and industrial products, the role and significance of newspapers and magazines have been immeasurably enhanced. It is very important to expand the distribution of newspapers and magazines so that they can reach the hands of every Soviet person.

    The subscription work for 1954 newspapers and magazines is now underway nationwide. In Ukrainian enterprises, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and institutions and schools, more than 30,000 periodical subscription stations have been established, and more than 50,000 people have been mobilized to participate in the subscription work.

    Newspaper and magazine distribution work is an important task of political significance. To organize the subscription work for newspapers and magazines well and bring them to the broad masses of working people means further enhancing the mobilizing and organizing power of newspapers and magazines in the fields of economic and cultural construction. Unfortunately, there are still many shortcomings in the distribution work in some republics and states. Due to the poor arrangement of newspaper and magazine distribution work, some publications cannot reach readers well.

    For example, in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, the subscription work for central newspapers and magazines began in October, and only 60 percent of the plan has been completed so far. The subscription work for republic publications and district newspapers has only completed 40 percent of the plan. In the districts of Bratushani, Kochuzhani, Briibok, and Yeshnets, the number of subscriptions for republic publications and district newspapers is only 10 percent of their published copies. In many villages in the Oronesti and Zguriți districts, there is an entirely intolerable phenomenon: the number of subscribers here has greatly increased in recent years, but the number of postmen remains the same. Now a postman has to serve 500 to 800 collective farm households, which makes newspaper and magazine distribution difficult.

    What do these facts show? They show that many party organizations, especially the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Moldavia, have abandoned the leadership of newspaper subscription work and transferred it to the "Newspaper and Magazine Joint Distribution Bureau." At the same time, the management office of the Republic's "Newspaper and Magazine Joint Distribution Bureau" and its branches in many districts and cities are working very poorly. To this day, subscription stations have not been established in many collective farms and machine tractor stations.

    Past experience has proven that the subscription work for district newspapers requires special attention from party organizations and postal and telecommunications authorities. At the same time, it is very incorrect for some regions to try to postpone the subscription work for district newspapers until the end of the year.

    The Ministry of Postal and Telecommunications and its central management office of the "Newspaper and Magazine Joint Distribution Bureau" are providing weak leadership and supervision over local branches, and have not taken necessary measures to strengthen the cadre.

    However, the party organs should be primarily responsible for the publication and distribution work, as it is the direct concern and responsibility of the party organizations. The state committees, frontier committees, and central committees of the union republics should take measures to ensure that all copies of newspapers and magazines are fully distributed. The party committees should regularly guide and supervise the work of the "Newspaper and Magazine Joint Distribution Bureau" agencies, and help them select, allocate, and train cadres.

    It is important to widely carry out explanatory work among residents, telling the working people about the newspapers and magazines published domestically and how to subscribe to them. However, the work of introducing periodicals using radio and newspapers is still done very poorly, and very few propaganda posters are published. It is necessary to widely attract intellectuals, workers, collective farm members, and agricultural mechanics to participate in the newspaper and magazine distribution work. The editorial departments of newspapers and magazines cannot stand idly by in such an important task as the distribution of newspapers and magazines.

    The spiritual life and cultural needs of the Soviet people are constantly growing. Fully meeting these needs and ensuring that the language of newspapers and magazines penetrates the broadest masses of the people is a major task for party organizations and postal and telecommunications workers. Let newspapers and magazines reach the masses!

      More Profoundly Understand Enterprise Economics

      The "Pravda" editorial on October 5, 1953, pointed out that the staff of enterprise party organizations must enrich their economic knowledge in order to do a good job of leading enterprises. The abstract is as follows:

    Due to the major tasks currently facing our industry, the requirements for party organizations in production enterprises are also constantly increasing. When the party organizations of enterprises exercise their power of supervision over administrative work, as granted to them by the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, they must use their power to influence all the work of the enterprises, mobilize the masses to complete and over fulfill state plans, actively support and promote the experience of innovators, and wage an uncompromising struggle against shortcomings.

    However, the facts show that many enterprise party organizations have not taken appropriate measures to improve the leadership of enterprises. Their intervention in the work of various factories and mines is often superficial and not specific, does not touch on key issues, and therefore does not achieve its purpose.

    The Kuibyshev City Committee and District Committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the party organizations of various enterprises in the city listened to reports from economic leaders and passed some lengthy resolutions, but at the same time, they did not deeply analyze the work of the enterprises, study the economics of the enterprises, and pay attention to their quality indicators. No wonder many enterprises in the city failed to complete the state plan for the first half of this year. These enterprises violated technical operating procedures and did not organize production work well, resulting in poor product quality and the emergence of shock work style.

    It is not enough to only listen to the reports of factory directors and pass resolutions. No matter how well these resolutions are written, if the resolutions do not have detailed suggestions and instructions to explain how to do it, and what specific measures should be taken to fully use production capacity, eliminate the phenomenon of non-rhythmic production, reduce product costs and improve their quality - such resolutions are useless.

    In order for party organizations to be able to lead industrial enterprises more skillfully, it is necessary to earnestly engage in the economic education of cadres. Previously, many party committees organized study groups on economic issues for activists. This made it possible for party, Soviet, and economic sector workers to enrich their economic knowledge and improve their methods of leading industry. Unfortunately, some party committees have recently paid less attention to the economic education of cadres.

    Naturally, the party committee cannot always explain some complex issues in production with its own capabilities. Therefore, it should more widely absorb activists - various experts, production innovators - to study various economic issues.

    It is very abnormal that some local party workers, in the struggle to complete the state's task of reducing product costs, often do not know what costs are and what methods to use to reduce costs. The "Kizel Coal Mine" Trust has several mines where the cost of mining per ton of coal is 50 percent higher than planned. The Kizel City Party Committee often mentions this matter, but has not sought to increase labor productivity, which is the main condition for reducing product costs. New mining machinery has not been well utilized, cyclical operation methods have not been adopted in production, and the initiatives of advanced miners have not received due support. Ignoring these fundamental issues and not actually solving these problems means only leading industry "generally and broadly."

    All organizational and political work of the party organizations and party committees of industrial enterprises should be used to discover and fully use existing reserve forces and production capacity in reducing product costs and improving labor productivity.

    In seminars, reports, and lectures, it is necessary to explain to the laborers that the reduction of product costs and the increase of labor productivity in all production departments have a decisive significance for improving the material welfare of the Soviet people. The higher the labor productivity and the lower the product costs of our enterprises, the lower the prices of products and commodities will be, and therefore the living standards of the people will be further improved.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    使报纸和杂志到群众中去
      “真理报”一九五三年十一月十三日发表社论，指出了报刊发行工作的重大的政治意义。摘要如下：
    苏联报刊——是新型的刊物，是劳动人民的共产主义教育的有力武器。我们报刊的全部活动是遵循着代表人民切身利益的共产党的政策。高度的思想性、正确性以及与人民不可分离的联系——就是苏联报刊的特征。
    当苏联人民顽强地争取国内丰足的食品和工业品的今天，报刊的作用和其意义是不可估量地提高了。使报纸和杂志发行得更广，使报纸杂志能到达每一个苏联人民的手里，这是很重要的工作。
    现在国内正在进行订阅一九五四年的报纸和杂志的工作。在乌克兰各企业、各集体农庄、机器拖拉机站以及机关和学校里，建立了三万多个定期刊物订购站。吸收了五万多人来参加订阅工作。
    报刊发行工作是一件具有政治意义的重要工作。好好地把报纸和杂志的订阅工作组织起来，把报纸和杂志带到广大的劳动人民群众中去——就是意味着更加提高报刊在经济和文化建设领域中的动员和组织的力量。可惜有些共和国和州的发行工作还有不少的缺点。由于报刊的发行工作安排得不好，有些出版物不能很好地到达读者的手里。
    例如，在莫尔达维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国，订阅中央报纸和杂志工作是从十月开始的，到现在仅完成计划的百分之六十，订阅共和国出版物和区报纸的工作只完成计划的百分之四十。在布拉都珊，科鸠然，布里包克，叶士涅茨这些区里，订阅共和国的出版物和区报纸的份数仅为它们出版份数的百分之十。在奥罗涅什特区，兹古里茨区的许多村里，有一种完全不能容忍的现象：近些年来这里的订户大大地增加了，而邮递员的数目仍然照旧。现在一个邮递员要为五百户至八百户集体农民服务，因而使报刊发行工作发生了困难。
    这些事实说明了什么呢？说明了许多党组织，首先是莫尔达维亚共产党中央委员会的宣传鼓动部放弃了对报刊订阅工作的领导，而转托给“报刊联合发行局”的机关。同时共和国的“报刊联合发行局”的管理处及其在许多区和城市的分处工作得很坏。直到今天在许多集体农庄，机器拖拉机站里还没有设立订阅站。
    过去几年的经验证明，区报纸的订阅工作是需要党组织和邮电机关的特殊注意。同时有些地区尽力把订阅区报的工作向后推到年底，这是非常不正确的。
    邮电部及其“报刊联合发行局”中央管理处对于各地分处的领导和监督是很软弱的，在干部的增强方面，也没有采取必要的措施。
    但是，对刊物发行工作负责的，首先应当是党的机关，因为这是党组织的切身事业及其责任。州委会和边疆区委会和加盟共和国中央委员会应当采取措施，以保证报纸和杂志的份数完全发行出去。党委会应该经常指导和监督“报刊联合发行局”机关的工作，帮助他们选拔、配备和培养干部。
    重要的是：在居民中要广泛地展开解释工作，告诉劳动人民国内出版的报纸、杂志，并且告诉他们订阅的办法。但是，利用广播、报纸介绍定期刊物的工作仍然作得很坏，宣传画出版得也很少。必须广泛地把知识分子、工人、集体农庄庄员，农业机械师吸引到报刊发行工作中来。报纸和杂志的编辑部对发行报刊这样重大的工作，也是不能袖手旁观的。
    苏联人民的精神生活和文化的要求不断地增长着。充分地满足这些要求，使报刊上的语言深入最广大的人民阶层，这就是党组织和邮电工作人员的重大任务，使报纸和杂志到群众中去！
      更深刻地通晓企业经济
      “真理报”一九五三年十月五日的社论指出，企业党组织的工作人员必须充实自己的经济知识，才能作好对企业的领导工作。摘要如下：
    由于目前我国工业面临的重大任务，对生产企业中党组织的要求也不断提高。企业的党组织执行苏联共产党党章赋予它们的对行政工作的监督权时，必须用他们的力量影响企业的全部工作，动员群众完成和超额完成国家计划，积极支持和推广革新者的经验，并对缺点进行不妥协的斗争。
    但是，事实表明，许多企业的党组织仍未采取适当措施来改进企业的领导工作。它们对各个工厂、矿场工作的干预，经常是肤浅的、不具体的，没有接触到关键问题，因此也达不到目的。
    苏联共产党古比雪夫市的市委会、区委会和该市各企业的党组织听取了经济领导者们的报告，通过了一些冗长的决议，同时却不去深刻地分析各企业的工作，不研究各企业的经济，不注意它们的工作质量指标。难怪市内很多企业没有完成国家今年上半年的国家计划。这些企业违反技术操作规程，对生产工作组织得不好，结果引起产品质量低劣和突击作风的出现。
    只听取厂长们的报告并通过决议，是不够的。不论这些决议写得怎样好，如果决议中没有详尽的建议和指示来说明应如何做，和该采取何种具体措施去充分使用生产能力，消除生产的无节奏现象，降低产品成本并提高其质量——这种决议便毫无用处。
    为使党组织能更加熟练地领导工业企业，就必须认真地从事干部的经济教育工作。以前许多党委会曾经为积极分子组织了研究经济问题的讲习班。这就使党、苏维埃和经济部门的工作人员有可能丰富自己的经济知识，并改善自己领导工业的方法。可惜，最近有些党委会已不甚注意干部的经济教育工作。
    自然，党委会不能常常以本身的能力说明生产中的一些复杂问题。因此，它应该更广泛地吸收积极分子——各种专家、生产革新者——来研究各种经济问题。
    有些地方的党的工作人员在争取完成国家降低产品成本的任务中，往往不知道什么是成本，和用什么方法降低成本，这种现象是十分不正常的。“基塞尔煤矿”托辣斯有几个矿井开采每吨煤的成本，高出计划百分之五十。基塞尔市党的市委会常提起这件事，但却没有设法提高作为降低产品成本主要条件的劳动生产率。新的采矿机械没有被很好地利用，在生产中没有采用循环作业法，先进的矿工的创议得不到应有的支持。撇开这些根本问题不顾，不去实际解决这些问题，就是意味着只是“一般地和笼统地”领导工业。
    工业企业的党组织和党委会的全部组织工作和政治工作都应当用于发掘和充分使用在降低产品成本和提高劳动生产率方面的现有的后备力量和生产能力。
    在座谈会、报告和讲演会上，必须向劳动者说明，一切生产部门产品成本的降低，劳动生产率的提高，对改进苏联人民的物质福利具有决定性的意义。我国企业的劳动生产率愈高、产品成本愈低，产品和商品的价格也便愈低，因此人民的生活水平也便会更加提高。
