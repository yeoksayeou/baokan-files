    Make Newspapers and Magazines Reach the Masses

      The "Pravda" published an editorial on November 13, 1953, pointing out the significant political importance of newspaper and magazine distribution work. The abstract is as follows:

    Soviet newspapers and magazines are a new type of publication and a powerful tool for the communist education of the working people. All activities of our newspapers and magazines follow the Communist Party's policies, which represent the vital interests of the people. High ideological content, correctness, and an inseparable connection with the people are the characteristics of Soviet newspapers and magazines.

    Today, as the Soviet people are striving tenaciously for abundant domestic food and industrial products, the role and significance of newspapers and magazines have been immeasurably enhanced. It is very important to expand the distribution of newspapers and magazines so that they can reach the hands of every Soviet person.

    The subscription work for 1954 newspapers and magazines is now underway nationwide. In Ukrainian enterprises, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and institutions and schools, more than 30,000 periodical subscription stations have been established, and more than 50,000 people have been mobilized to participate in the subscription work.

    Newspaper and magazine distribution work is an important task of political significance. To organize the subscription work for newspapers and magazines well and bring them to the broad masses of working people means further enhancing the mobilizing and organizing power of newspapers and magazines in the fields of economic and cultural construction. Unfortunately, there are still many shortcomings in the distribution work in some republics and states. Due to the poor arrangement of newspaper and magazine distribution work, some publications cannot reach readers well.

    For example, in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, the subscription work for central newspapers and magazines began in October, and only 60 percent of the plan has been completed so far. The subscription work for republic publications and district newspapers has only completed 40 percent of the plan. In the districts of Bratushani, Kochuzhani, Briibok, and Yeshnets, the number of subscriptions for republic publications and district newspapers is only 10 percent of their published copies. In many villages in the Oronesti and Zguri»õi districts, there is an entirely intolerable phenomenon: the number of subscribers here has greatly increased in recent years, but the number of postmen remains the same. Now a postman has to serve 500 to 800 collective farm households, which makes newspaper and magazine distribution difficult.

    What do these facts show? They show that many party organizations, especially the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Moldavia, have abandoned the leadership of newspaper subscription work and transferred it to the "Newspaper and Magazine Joint Distribution Bureau." At the same time, the management office of the Republic's "Newspaper and Magazine Joint Distribution Bureau" and its branches in many districts and cities are working very poorly. To this day, subscription stations have not been established in many collective farms and machine tractor stations.

    Past experience has proven that the subscription work for district newspapers requires special attention from party organizations and postal and telecommunications authorities. At the same time, it is very incorrect for some regions to try to postpone the subscription work for district newspapers until the end of the year.

    The Ministry of Postal and Telecommunications and its central management office of the "Newspaper and Magazine Joint Distribution Bureau" are providing weak leadership and supervision over local branches, and have not taken necessary measures to strengthen the cadre.

    However, the party organs should be primarily responsible for the publication and distribution work, as it is the direct concern and responsibility of the party organizations. The state committees, frontier committees, and central committees of the union republics should take measures to ensure that all copies of newspapers and magazines are fully distributed. The party committees should regularly guide and supervise the work of the "Newspaper and Magazine Joint Distribution Bureau" agencies, and help them select, allocate, and train cadres.

    It is important to widely carry out explanatory work among residents, telling the working people about the newspapers and magazines published domestically and how to subscribe to them. However, the work of introducing periodicals using radio and newspapers is still done very poorly, and very few propaganda posters are published. It is necessary to widely attract intellectuals, workers, collective farm members, and agricultural mechanics to participate in the newspaper and magazine distribution work. The editorial departments of newspapers and magazines cannot stand idly by in such an important task as the distribution of newspapers and magazines.

    The spiritual life and cultural needs of the Soviet people are constantly growing. Fully meeting these needs and ensuring that the language of newspapers and magazines penetrates the broadest masses of the people is a major task for party organizations and postal and telecommunications workers. Let newspapers and magazines reach the masses!

      More Profoundly Understand Enterprise Economics

      The "Pravda" editorial on October 5, 1953, pointed out that the staff of enterprise party organizations must enrich their economic knowledge in order to do a good job of leading enterprises. The abstract is as follows:

    Due to the major tasks currently facing our industry, the requirements for party organizations in production enterprises are also constantly increasing. When the party organizations of enterprises exercise their power of supervision over administrative work, as granted to them by the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, they must use their power to influence all the work of the enterprises, mobilize the masses to complete and over fulfill state plans, actively support and promote the experience of innovators, and wage an uncompromising struggle against shortcomings.

    However, the facts show that many enterprise party organizations have not taken appropriate measures to improve the leadership of enterprises. Their intervention in the work of various factories and mines is often superficial and not specific, does not touch on key issues, and therefore does not achieve its purpose.

    The Kuibyshev City Committee and District Committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the party organizations of various enterprises in the city listened to reports from economic leaders and passed some lengthy resolutions, but at the same time, they did not deeply analyze the work of the enterprises, study the economics of the enterprises, and pay attention to their quality indicators. No wonder many enterprises in the city failed to complete the state plan for the first half of this year. These enterprises violated technical operating procedures and did not organize production work well, resulting in poor product quality and the emergence of shock work style.

    It is not enough to only listen to the reports of factory directors and pass resolutions. No matter how well these resolutions are written, if the resolutions do not have detailed suggestions and instructions to explain how to do it, and what specific measures should be taken to fully use production capacity, eliminate the phenomenon of non-rhythmic production, reduce product costs and improve their quality - such resolutions are useless.

    In order for party organizations to be able to lead industrial enterprises more skillfully, it is necessary to earnestly engage in the economic education of cadres. Previously, many party committees organized study groups on economic issues for activists. This made it possible for party, Soviet, and economic sector workers to enrich their economic knowledge and improve their methods of leading industry. Unfortunately, some party committees have recently paid less attention to the economic education of cadres.

    Naturally, the party committee cannot always explain some complex issues in production with its own capabilities. Therefore, it should more widely absorb activists - various experts, production innovators - to study various economic issues.

    It is very abnormal that some local party workers, in the struggle to complete the state's task of reducing product costs, often do not know what costs are and what methods to use to reduce costs. The "Kizel Coal Mine" Trust has several mines where the cost of mining per ton of coal is 50 percent higher than planned. The Kizel City Party Committee often mentions this matter, but has not sought to increase labor productivity, which is the main condition for reducing product costs. New mining machinery has not been well utilized, cyclical operation methods have not been adopted in production, and the initiatives of advanced miners have not received due support. Ignoring these fundamental issues and not actually solving these problems means only leading industry "generally and broadly."

    All organizational and political work of the party organizations and party committees of industrial enterprises should be used to discover and fully use existing reserve forces and production capacity in reducing product costs and improving labor productivity.

    In seminars, reports, and lectures, it is necessary to explain to the laborers that the reduction of product costs and the increase of labor productivity in all production departments have a decisive significance for improving the material welfare of the Soviet people. The higher the labor productivity and the lower the product costs of our enterprises, the lower the prices of products and commodities will be, and therefore the living standards of the people will be further improved.
