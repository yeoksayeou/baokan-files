　　Shahe Township, Licheng, Shandong Strengthens Specific Leadership of Mutual Aid Teams in Cooperative Construction
　　Zheng Song
　　While piloting agricultural production cooperatives, Shahe Township in Licheng County, Shandong Province, paid attention to consolidating, improving, and developing the work of mutual aid teams, and has now achieved preliminary results.

　　After deeply and extensively publicizing the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, the peasants' enthusiasm for establishing agricultural production cooperatives greatly increased. More than 310 peasant households in the township requested to join agricultural production cooperatives. After full deliberation and discussion, as of now, 39 peasant households from 7 mutual aid teams in the township have joined the original Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative, and 202 peasant households from 31 mutual aid teams have voluntarily formed 9 new agricultural production cooperatives. The peasant households participating in the cooperatives account for more than 30% of the total number of peasant households in the township. These new cooperatives have now elected preparatory committees and are studying specific issues such as land shares.

　　Cadres Abandon Leadership of
　　Mutual Aid Teams During Cooperative Construction
　　In the early stages of expanding and piloting agricultural production cooperatives, party members, cadres, and activists in Shahe Township abandoned their leadership of mutual aid teams. The reason was that many village cadres, party members, and activists believed that agricultural production cooperatives were semi-socialist in nature, advanced, and glorious, and that working on mutual aid teams was not "satisfying," so they were unwilling to actively lead mutual aid teams. Many mutual aid teams were pulled apart because some of the core members and members joined the cooperatives while other members had not yet joined. A small number of cadres, party members, and activists, because their families did not agree to their joining the cooperatives, saw that other mutual aid teams had established agricultural production cooperatives while their own teams had not, and had the idea of being afraid of "losing face" or being "unglorious," so they were in low spirits and were not active in leading the work of mutual aid teams. In addition, many individual farmers who had not joined mutual aid teams or cooperatives in the past actively requested leadership to organize them under the education of the general line and the influence of the newly established agricultural production cooperatives, but the leadership work could not keep up.

　　Criticizing Erroneous Ideas and Specifically Resolving the Issue of
　　Leadership of Mutual Aid Teams
　　The county committee work team stationed in the township discovered these problems. First, they carefully checked the implementation of the policy of piloting agricultural production cooperatives based on mutual aid teams, and of driving mutual aid teams through piloting agricultural production cooperatives. They criticized the idea of neglecting the leadership of mutual aid teams, enabling township cadres and activists to further clarify the relationship between piloting agricultural production cooperatives and doing a good job in mutual aid teams. The work team also assisted the Shahe Township Branch of the Communist Party of China to promptly take the following measures to strengthen the leadership of mutual aid teams.

　　First, for village cadres, party members, and activists, through checking and summarizing the work of piloting agricultural production cooperatives in the previous stage, it was explained that the large-scale development of mutual aid teams is an important foundation for further developing agricultural production cooperatives, and that to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, the leadership of mutual aid teams must not be neglected. And they were inspired to discuss how to lay a good foundation for further developing cooperatives in the future on the basis of the existing piloting agricultural production cooperatives, specifically pointing out the ratio of the number of peasant households that have joined the cooperatives and those that have not, so that everyone knows that the peasants who have not joined the cooperatives are still the vast majority. As a result, the cadres further realized the necessity of leading the peasants to further organize, and realized that doing a good job in mutual aid teams is an important foundation for establishing agricultural production cooperatives, and consciously demanded to strengthen the leadership of mutual aid teams. In addition to further educating ordinary mutual aid team leaders and the masses on the policy of mutual aid and cooperation, they also focused on explaining the conditions for establishing cooperatives to them, inspiring them to discuss whether they are qualified to establish cooperatives now and how to strive to establish cooperatives in the future, so that they can realize that doing a good job in mutual aid teams now can prepare conditions for establishing cooperatives in the future and produce more grain, overcoming the impatience of some people.

　　Second, village cadres, party members, and activists made specific divisions of labor for leading mutual aid teams and piloting agricultural production cooperatives. Cadres and party members who have joined the cooperatives are mainly responsible for leading the piloting of agricultural production cooperatives, while cadres and party members who have not joined the cooperatives are assigned to master and lead the existing mutual aid teams; in electoral districts where cadres and party members have all or mostly joined the cooperatives, the division of labor is carried out within the cooperatives, with some people participating in the cooperative affairs committee to specifically lead the work of running the cooperatives, and some people, especially administrative cadres, not participating in the specific leadership of the cooperatives, but dividing the labor to lead the mutual aid teams, and at the same time, the team leaders of the mutual aid teams are also absorbed to participate in the meetings of the cooperatives. Some party member cadres in Electoral District 1 joined the cooperatives, and some did not. After adopting the method of dividing the labor to lead, they piloted an agricultural production cooperative with 20 peasant households participating, and also reorganized 5 and newly developed 3 mutual aid teams, developing 18 new members. The two party members and the head and deputy heads of the electoral districts in Electoral Districts 2 and 3 all joined the Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative, and they divided the labor, with some people leading the cooperative and some people mastering typical teams to make examples to promote the consolidation and development of general teams. In this way, not only did 7 teams and 39 households join the Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative in these two electoral districts, but they also helped the Li Yanlu and Duan Defen mutual aid teams make examples, gave introductions at the electoral district meetings, reorganized 5 mutual aid teams that had collapsed in the past, and newly developed 6 mutual aid teams.

　　Third, it was required that cadres and party members and activists who wanted to join the agricultural production cooperatives should not allow their original mutual aid teams to collapse because they and some members joined the cooperatives, and they were mobilized to take time to participate in the meetings of their original teams to help consolidate and expand the mutual aid teams. If some members of the mutual aid team did not agree to join the cooperatives, and only individual core members wanted to join the cooperatives, the core members were mobilized not to join the cooperatives first, in order to do a good job in the mutual aid teams and move forward together with the masses. This also ensured that many mutual aid teams that were "pulled apart" and lost leadership during the process of joining the cooperatives were reorganized in a timely manner. The Lu Shouchun mutual aid team had a total of 15 households. The team leader and 10 members joined the cooperatives, and the remaining 4 households did not join the cooperatives and wanted to work on their own. After Lu Shouchun further clarified the benefits of organizing to them, he educated them and absorbed a single farmer into the team, and reorganized a mutual aid team.

　　Fourth, the reorganization was carried out according to the different situations of each team. For teams that have not changed during the piloting of agricultural production cooperatives, the main task is to further carry out general line education and improve the ideological awareness of team members. For temporary teams, help them improve to regular teams with work point records, and for regular teams, help them further solve problems in production and business management. If the sideline accounting of individual teams is unclear, help them clear their accounts, and generally help them formulate winter and spring production plans. For teams that lost leadership because the team leader and some members joined the cooperatives during the piloting of agricultural production cooperatives, the main task is to help them elect team leaders, consolidate them, and expand them appropriately. For teams that collapsed during the piloting of the cooperatives, the main task is to help them merge with other teams or absorb single farmers to reorganize mutual aid teams. In this way, all types of mutual aid teams have been reorganized and improved. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 18 mutual aid teams have been improved through reorganization, and all 16 teams that lost leadership due to the team leader taking some members to join the cooperatives have now elected team leaders, and 9 teams have been appropriately expanded. Four of the five mutual aid teams that were pulled apart due to the piloting of the cooperatives have been merged to form new mutual aid teams, and one team has absorbed single farmers and reorganized a new mutual aid team.

　　Fifth, convene symposiums for individual farmers to help them plan winter and spring production, inspire them to discuss the benefits of organizing, and make them consciously and voluntarily demand to join cooperatives and teams. For example, there are more individual farmers in Electoral Districts 1, 2, and 3. They convened symposiums for individual farmers, and on the basis of carrying out education on the two roads, introduced the production plans of cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and discussed how they should carry out soil improvement in winter and deep plowing and careful cultivation in spring. In this way, many individual farmers felt that it was difficult to do a good job in production by working alone, and they demanded to join cooperatives and teams to solve their difficulties. Therefore, when piloting cooperatives in these three electoral districts, 19 individual farmers joined agricultural production cooperatives and 57 individual farmers joined mutual aid teams. There are relatively few individual farmers in Electoral Districts 6, 7, and 8. After they adopted the method of gradually educating individual farmers, all farmers have now joined agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams.

　　Promote the Development of Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations
　　After the work team helped the farmers in Shahe Township to do the above work, not only did they pilot 9 agricultural production cooperatives and help the Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative expand from 19 households to 58 households, but also greatly promoted the consolidation and development of mutual aid teams in the process of piloting agricultural production cooperatives. According to preliminary statistics, there was one agricultural production cooperative with 19 members and 64 mutual aid teams with 537 members in the autumn of 1953 in the township. Peasants participating in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams accounted for more than 70% of the total number of peasant households in the township; now the number of agricultural production cooperatives has increased to 10, with 260 members. The original mutual aid teams have been consolidated and improved after reorganization, and 11 new teams have been developed, with a total of 61 teams and 409 members. Peasants participating in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams now account for more than 80% of the total number of peasant households in the township.

　　山东历城沙河乡在建社中加强了对互助组的具体领导
    郑　松
    山东历城县沙河乡在试办农业生产合作社的同时，注意了整理提高和发展互助组的工作，现在已经取得了初步成绩。
    沙河乡经过深入广泛地宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务后，农民对于成立农业生产合作社的积极性大为提高，全乡有三百一十多户农民要求参加农业生产合作社。经过充分酝酿讨论，截至目前为止，全乡已有七个互助组三十九户农民参加了原有的王朝佑农业生产合作社，有三十一个互助组二百零二户农民自愿组成了九个新的农业生产合作社。参加社的农户占全乡总农户数的百分之三十多。这些新社现在都已选出了办社筹备委员会，正在研究土地入股等具体问题。
    干部在办社过程中放弃了对
        互助组的领导
    沙河乡党团员、干部和积极分子，在扩大和试办农业生产合作社的初期，放弃了对互助组的领导。原因是不少乡村干部、党团员和积极分子认为农业生产合作社是半社会主义性质的，是先进的，光荣的，搞互助组不“解渴”，因而不愿积极领导互助组。不少互助组由于一部分骨干和组员入了社而另一部分组员尚未入社，互助组被拉垮了。少数干部、党团员和积极分子，因为要求入社没有得到家庭同意，他们看到别的互助组成立了农业生产合作社而自己组未能成立社，存在着怕“丢人”“不光荣”的思想，因而情绪低落，对领导互助组的工作不积极了。以及不少过去未入组入社的单干农民在总路线教育下和新建立农业生产合作社的影响下，积极要求领导他们组织起来，但是领导工作赶不上。
    批判错误思想，具体解决对
        互助组的领导问题
    驻该乡的县委工作组发现了这些问题，首先认真地检查了以互助组为基础试办农业生产合作社，和通过试办农业生产合作社带动互助组的方针的执行情况，批判了忽视领导互助组的思想，使乡干部和积极分子进一步明确认识了试办农业生产合作社和搞好互助组的相互关系。工作组并协助中共沙河乡支部及时地采取了如下办法，加强了对互助组的领导。
    首先，对乡村干部、党团员和积极分子，通过检查总结前段试办农业生产合作社的工作，说明大量发展互助组是进一步发展农业生产合作社的重要基础，说明农业要实现社会主义改造，绝对不能忽视对互助组的领导。并启发大家讨论，在现有试办农业生产合作社的基础上，如何为今后进一步发展社打好基础的问题，具体指出现在入社的农民和还没有入社农民的户数比例，使大家知道没有入社的农民还是绝大多数。这样一来，干部便更加认识了领导农民进一步组织起来的必要性，认识了搞好互助组是成立农业生产合作社的重要基础，自觉地要求加强对互助组的领导。对一般互助组长和群众除了进一步进行互助合作政策的教育外，还着重对他们说明办社的条件，启发他们讨论现在成立社够不够条件和如何争取将来成立社，使他们认识，现在搞好互助组就可为将来成立合作社准备好条件和多打粮食，克服了一部分人存在的急躁情绪。
    第二，乡村干部党团员和积极分子，对领导互助组和试办农业生产合作社作了具体分工。入了社的干部、党团员主要负责领导试办农业生产合作社，而没有入社的干部、党团员就对现有互助组分工掌握和领导互助组；在干部和党团员已全部或大部入了社的选区，则在社内进行了分工，一部分人参加社务委员会具体领导办社工作，一部分人特别是行政干部，就不参加社的具体领导，而分工领导互助组，同时社内开会时也吸收互助组组长参加。一选区党员干部有的入了社，有的没有入社，采用分工领导的办法后，试办了一个有二十户农民参加的农业生产合作社，还整理了五个和新发展了三个互助组，发展新组员十八户。二、三选区的两个党员和正副选区主任全部入了王朝佑农业生产合作社，他们便分工，一部分人领导合作社，一部分人掌握典型组作出样子，以推动一般组的巩固发展。这样，该两选区不但有七个组三十九户加入了王朝佑农业生产合作社，还帮助李延禄和段得芬互助组作出样子，在选区会上作了介绍，整理好了五个过去垮台的互助组和新发展了六个互助组。
    第三，要求参加农业生产合作社的干部和党团员积极分子不要因为自己和一部分组员入社，而使自己原有的互助组垮台，动员他们抽空参加自己原组会议，帮助把互助组巩固扩大起来。有的互助组组员不同意入社而只有个别骨干想入社，则动员骨干分子先不入社，以搞好互助组，和群众一同前进。这样也保证了许多在入社中被“拉垮”和失去领导的互助组及时得到整理。路守纯互助组共十五户，组长和十户组员入了社，剩下四户没有入社，想各自干，经过路守纯对他们进一步讲清楚组织起来的好处以后，教育他们又吸收了一户单干农民入组，重新组成了一个互助组。
    第四，根据各个组的不同情况进行了整理。对于在试办农业生产合作社过程中没有变动的组，主要是进一步进行总路线教育，提高组员思想觉悟。对临时性组帮助其提高到记工算账的常年组，对常年组帮助其进一步解决生产经营管理上的问题，个别组副业账目不清，就帮助其清算账目，并普遍帮助他们订出冬季和春季的生产计划。对于在试办农业生产合作社中组长带一部组员入了社而失去领导的组，主要是帮助他们选出组长，巩固下来，并加以适当扩大。对在试办社中被拉垮了的组，主要是帮助他们和别的组合并或吸收单干农民重新组织互助组。这样一来，各种类型的互助组都得到整理提高。据初步统计，经过整理得到提高的互助组共十八个，因组长带一部分组员入社失去领导的十六个组，现在已经全部选出组长，并有九个组得到了适当扩大。因为试办社拉垮的五个互助组已经有四个组合并组成了新的互助组，一个组吸收单干农民也重新组成了新的互助组。
    第五，召开单干农民座谈会，帮助他们计划冬季和春季的生产，启发他们讨论组织起来的好处，使他们自觉自愿地要求入社入组，如一、二、三选区的单干农民较多，他们召开了单干农民座谈会议，在进行两条道路教育的基础上，介绍了合作社和互助组的生产计划，座谈了他们自己冬季如何进行改良土壤和春季如何深耕细作等工作。这样，许多单干农民感到，要把生产搞得很好，单干是有困难的，要求入社入组解决困难。因而该三个选区在试办合作社时，便有十九户单干农民入了农业生产合作社，五十七户单干农民加入了互助组。六、七、八选区单干农民比较少，他们采用了对单干农民逐步进行教育的方法后，现在农民已经全部入了农业生产合作社和互助组。
    推动互助合作组织发展
    工作组帮助沙河乡农民做了上述工作以后，不但试办了九个农业生产合作社和帮助王朝佑农业生产合作社由十九户扩大到五十八户，而且在试办农业生产合作社过程中还大大地推动了互助组的巩固和发展。据初步统计，全乡在一九五三年秋季共有农业生产合作社一个，社员十九户，互助组六十四个，组员五百三十七户，参加农业生产合作社和互助组的农民占全乡总农户的百分之七十多；现在农业生产合作社已经增至十个，社员二百六十户，原有的互助组经过整理，都巩固提高了一步，并新发展了十一个组，现共六十一个组，组员四百零九户。参加农业生产合作社和互助组的农民已占全乡总农户数的百分之八十多。
