    Jinan City's Propaganda and Education Work in Handling the Issue of Higher Primary School Graduates
    Jinan Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education
    In the summer of 1953, Jinan City had a total of 6,846 higher primary school graduates. Together with the higher primary school graduates who failed to enter higher education in 1952, there were more than 8,000 people. When enrolling students in 1953, the number of students applying for the first year of junior high school reached more than 24,000 (two-thirds of whom were higher primary school graduates from rural areas). With so many applicants, the number of admissions was limited. According to the original plan, all public and private middle schools in the city would enroll a total of 3,250 first-year junior high school students. A large number of higher primary school graduates could not enter higher education, and at that time, the problem was very serious. However, under the timely guidance and assistance of higher-level leading organs and based on the specific circumstances at the time, we adopted several specific measures and finally resolved this issue relatively smoothly.
    We believe that attaching importance to propaganda and education work is one of the important reasons why this work could be carried out relatively smoothly. Here, we will focus on introducing our experience in this area.
    Due to the large number of applicants and the limited number of new students admitted to middle schools, the issue of higher primary school graduates affected all levels of society, especially students and their parents, and their emotions were very volatile. Therefore, before, during, and after enrollment, we paid special attention to propaganda and education work for higher primary school graduates and their parents. Before middle school enrollment, we held meetings for primary school principals and teachers in charge of graduating classes, invited people to give special reports on the issue of higher primary school graduates, and organized everyone to study relevant documents on solving the problem of higher primary school graduates' future paths. After discussions, we initially corrected the thinking of some teachers who believed that all higher primary school graduates must enter middle school. Subsequently, propaganda was carried out through radio broadcasts, lectures, and teachers conducting home visits, so that higher primary school graduates understood the reason why they could not all enter middle school at present, and parents also understood that they should correctly treat their children's enrollment issues.
    After the middle school enrollment work began, we worked harder to conduct propaganda and education work for applicants. The methods adopted were: on the one hand, using loudspeakers at the registration office to repeatedly educate candidates, or taking advantage of the opportunity for candidates to wait to register to educate them in batches; on the other hand, using the opportunity of oral examinations to educate them. Before the exams, we uniformly assigned tasks to all middle schools, requiring them to concentrate the candidates in the examination room after the last class and conduct another education on correctly treating the issue of enrollment. The people responsible for this work were all teachers with high levels of expertise. Beforehand, we had gathered these teachers together and explained the policies. This work played a considerable role in stabilizing the emotions of the candidates in a timely manner.
    The announcement of results was also a process of conducting propaganda and education work. With a large number of applicants and a small number of admissions, everyone crowded together to see the results, which could easily cause emotional fluctuations among students who were not admitted. Therefore, we decided to adopt the method of first sending written notices and then posting the results. The notices were divided into three types: one for students who were not admitted, mainly explaining the reason why it is currently impossible for all higher primary school graduates to enter middle school, and that those who do not enter higher education can participate in productive labor, supplementary studies, or self-study; one for the parents of students who were not admitted, mainly asking them not to scold their children because they failed the exam, but to comfort and encourage their children well, and help them with self-study or participate in supplementary studies; and another for admitted students, in addition to notifying them of the start date and registration procedures, mainly asking them to comfort and help their classmates who were not admitted. In order to ensure that all students received the notice before the results were announced, each school asked the candidates to leave postage stamps and envelopes with their communication addresses written on them after the exam. For rural students, they were mobilized to return to their hometowns immediately to wait, so as not to spend all their money waiting to see the results, making it difficult for them to return home. During the process of announcing the results, we paid special attention to educating students who were not admitted and helping them solve their learning problems. In order to educate students who were not admitted in a timely manner, we notified all enrollment schools to send the list of admitted students in the city to their original graduating schools before the results were announced. After receiving the list, each primary school immediately gathered the students who were not admitted to middle school to educate them, stabilize their emotions, and tell them about the news of continuing to recruit new students and opening cultural supplementary schools; and began to establish a "Return to School Day" for graduates, designating someone to be responsible for educating graduates who were not admitted to middle school. Some schools organized graduates according to residential areas, with teachers responsible for conducting education separately. For individual parents (who may blame students because of ideological disagreements), the school sent people to make key home visits and patiently conducted propaganda and explanation work.
    Due to the close cooperation between the schools enrolling new students and the graduating schools of the candidates, the propaganda and education work was well done, and other specific measures were taken. The resolution of the problem of higher primary school graduates in Jinan City in 1953 was basically smooth, the emotions of the candidates were generally normal, and the reactions of the parents were also very good.
    In the propaganda and education work for handling the issue of higher primary school graduates, we have the following experiences: First, propaganda and education work should strive to be proactive and should be carried out in a planned and prepared manner, and continuous in-depth inspections should be conducted during the process. The scope of propaganda and education should be broad, in addition to educating graduating students, it is also necessary to conduct propaganda for the parents of graduating students and people from all walks of life, so that everyone can have a correct understanding of this issue and support the government's measures. The focus of propaganda and education for primary schools should be on the parents of graduates. Although we paid attention to this point in the propaganda and education work after the start of enrollment, we took a detour because the prior planning was not thorough enough, which should be avoided in this year's work. Second, propaganda and education work must run through the entire process of enrollment, from registration, oral examination, written examination, sending notices to before and after the announcement of results, one link tightly linked to another, and cannot be relaxed. Especially during the registration period, this work should be carried out repeatedly, otherwise it will not be easy to achieve results. In addition, it is easier to solve the ideological problems of students and parents by conducting education through real people and real events. For example, some schools used the numbers of the development of primary and secondary schools in the city after liberation to show that the People's Government has always attached importance to running schools; used the examples of some higher primary school graduates who improved themselves in their work to show that there is also a bright future for those who do not enter higher education, which have all achieved good results. Secondly, using the method of home visits, starting from "casual conversations," and conducting relatively detailed and in-depth propaganda according to different objects is also a good method.
    Of course, these are all temporary solutions after all. The seriousness of the problem of higher primary school graduates in 1953 shows that our school's labor education in the past was not done well enough. Truly improving the school's labor education, so that students have a correct view of labor, and doing a good job of propaganda work to the society, so that every parent can correctly treat the issue of higher primary school graduates' future paths, is the fundamental plan. This is an important task that we must do well this year.

    济南市在处理高小毕业生问题中的宣传教育工作
    济南市人民政府文教局
    济南市一九五三年暑期共有高小毕业生六千八百四十六人，连同一九五二年未能升学的高小毕业生，共有八千多人。到一九五三年招生时，报考初中一年级的学生竟达二万四千多人（其中有三分之二是从农村来的高小毕业生）。报名人数这样多，录取名额却有限，按原定计划，全市公私立中学共招收初中一年级新生三千二百五十人。大量高小毕业生不能升学，当时，问题曾是很严重的。但是，在上级领导机关的及时指导和帮助下，根据当时的具体情况，采取了若干具体措施，我们终于比较顺利地解决了这一问题。
    我们认为，重视宣传教育工作是这次工作得以比较顺利进行的重要原因之一。这里我们专就这方面的经验作一介绍。
    由于投考学生太多，而中学招收新生的名额有限，高小毕业生问题牵动了社会上各个阶层，特别是学生和学生家长，情绪很波动。因此，在招生前后和招生过程中，我们特别注意了对高小毕业生及其家长的宣传教育工作。在中学招生以前，我们曾召开小学校长和毕业生班级任教师会议，请人作了关于高小毕业生问题的专题报告，并组织大家学习了有关解决高小毕业生出路问题的文件。经过座谈讨论，初步纠正了某些教师认为高小毕业生必须全部升入中学的思想。随后，又通过广播、讲课和教师进行家庭访问等方式，进行宣传，使高小毕业生懂得了目前不能全部升入中学的道理，家长也懂得了应该正确地对待子女的升学问题。
    中学招生工作开始后，我们更努力向投考学生进行宣传教育工作。采用的方法是：一方面在报名处利用扩音器，向考生反复进行教育，或利用考生等候报名的机会，分批进行教育；另一方面，利用口试的机会进行教育。考试前，我们又统一向各中学布置了任务，要求他们在考完最末一节课后，以试场为单位，再集中向考生进行一次正确对待升学问题的教育。负责这一工作的都是水平较高的教师。事前，我们曾将这些教师召集起来，讲解了政策。这些工作，对及时稳定考生情绪，起了相当大的作用。
    发榜过程也是进行宣传教育工作的过程。报考学生多，录取学生少，大家拥挤在一起看榜，容易引起未录取学生的情绪波动。因此，我们决定采取先发书面通知，后发榜的办法。通知共分三种：一种是给未录取学生的，主要说明目前不可能使所有高小毕业生全部升入中学的道理，升不上学可以参加生产劳动，补习或自修；一种是给未录取学生的家长的，主要是请他们不要因为孩子未考上学校，便加以斥责，要很好地安慰和鼓励自己的子女，并帮助他们自修或参加补习；另一种是给录取生的，除通知其开学日期及报到手续外，主要是要他们对没有考取的同学给以安慰和帮助。为了保证学生都能在发榜前接到通知，各校在考试完毕后，都让考生留下邮票和写好通信地址的信封。对于农村学生，则动员他们立即回乡等候，这样免得他们为了等着看榜，把钱用光了，回家困难。在发榜过程中，我们特别注意了向未录取学生进行教育，并帮助他们解决学习问题。为了及时向未录取学生进行教育，我们曾通知各招生学校，在发榜前，将本市录取生名单，分别送到他们的原毕业学校，各小学接到名单后，立即召集本校未考取中学的学生进行教育，稳定他们的情绪，同时，把续招新生和开办文化补习学校等消息告诉他们；并开始建立毕业生“返校日”，指定专人负责向未考取中学的毕业生进行教育。有的学校，则将毕业生按居民区组织起来，由教师分头负责进行教育。对个别家长（他们可能因为思想不通责备学生），由学校派人重点地作家庭访问，耐心地进行了宣传解释工作。
    由于招收新生的学校和考生毕业的母校的密切配合，做好了宣传教育工作，并采取了其他各项具体措施，济南市一九五三年高小毕业生问题的解决基本上是顺利的，考生情绪一般是正常的，学生家长的反应也很好。
    在处理高小毕业生问题的宣传教育工作中，我们有以下几点体会：一、宣传教育工作应该争取主动，并且要有计划、有准备地进行，进行中要不断地深入检查。宣传教育的面要广，除了向毕业学生进行教育外，还要向毕业学生的家长及各界人士进行宣传，使大家对这一问题都能有正确的认识，拥护政府的措施。宣传教育的对象，小学应以毕业生家长为重点。这次招生开始后的宣传教育工作，我们虽然注意到这一点，但是因为事前的计划不够周密，曾经走了一段弯路，这是在今年的工作中应该避免的。二、宣传教育工作必须贯穿在招生工作的全部过程中，从报名、口试、笔试、发通知到发榜前后，一环紧扣一环，不能放松。特别是在报名期间，应反复进行这一工作，否则不易收效。另外，通过真人真事进行教育，比较容易解决学生和家长的思想问题。如某些学校用解放后本市中小学发展的数字，说明人民政府对办学一向是重视的；用某些高小毕业生在工作中提高了自己的实例，来说明升不上学同样有光明前途，都收到了很好的效果。其次，用家庭访问的方式，从“拉家常”谈起，根据不同对象，进行比较细致深入的宣传，也是很好的办法。
    自然，上述这些，毕竟都是治标的办法。一九五三年高小毕业生问题的严重情况，说明了过去我们学校的劳动教育是做得太不好了。切实改进学校的劳动教育，使学生具有正确的劳动观点，向社会做好宣传工作，让每一个学生家长都能正确地对待高小毕业生的出路问题，才是根本之图。这就是我们今年要做好的一项重要工作。
