To Soldier Rushong:

　　On November 2nd last year, your mother was at home kneading dough, preparing to make noodles, when your neighbor, Sister Xingni, from the next courtyard, came running to our house, out of breath, saying that you had performed meritorious service on the Korean front, and the good news had already reached the cooperative. When she said this, your mother panicked and ran out with her flour-covered hands. As expected, the cooperative was already crowded with people, discussing it. As soon as your mother entered, she didn't bother to speak to anyone and asked the comrade sent by the county to our cooperative to lead production to read the words on the meritorious service report to her. Seeing how happy she was, I jokingly said to her, "Your son has performed meritorious service, but you can't take all the credit; I have a share too!" Before she could speak, others chimed in, saying, "Everyone has a share; even all the villagers feel extremely honored!"
　　"If we're talking about honor, the whole country has a share, and we must first give credit to Chairman Mao!"...

　　Rushong, since you joined the Volunteer Army, our family has never fallen behind others in production or learning. Before joining the cooperative, people said that since you were serving in the army, your family had fewer hands, so they should till our land for us. Rushong, think about it, your father isn't incapable of working. Why should we ask others to till our land for us? Your wife, Xiurong, and I took over all of our family's land; whenever we had free time, we also helped military families with fewer hands to cultivate their land. Because of this, in October 1952, the county evaluated me as a model military family member in the entire county. Your younger brother, Ruting, is also studying very hard in school. He can recite, explain, and use almost everything the teachers have taught him. Whenever he has time, he also helps everyone in the cooperative with production. Last semester, he was also selected as a study model. He also said, "I want to study hard, and when I grow up, I will definitely go find my brother and fight American devils with him!" As for your wife, Xiurong, she is even more energetic. She is the leader of the women's group in the cooperative and is always leading the women forward. During the drought resistance in May two years ago, she led eight women to challenge eight men, and as a result, they watered and planted three mu of sweet potatoes in one day, planting 0.5 mu more than the men! In June and July of that year, when the sorghum was about to head and tassel, it was suddenly infested with borers. Using pesticides didn't work, so she led everyone to pick them off one by one with needle tips, eliminating all the pests. The average yield was 362 jin per mu. That year, the cotton was even more infested with insects, so she led all 24 women in the cooperative to catch them 23 times in a row, resulting in a bumper cotton harvest, with an average of 397.75 jin per mu! At the same time, Xiurong is also very good at managing household affairs and taking care of the elderly very considerately. Whether it's hot or cold, single or padded, she arranges everything neatly and logically. Everyone praises her as a good daughter-in-law! In November 1952, she was评为 evaluated as a second-class patriotic labor model in the entire county; in December, she joined the Communist Youth League and became a glorious Youth League member! Rushong, you see, our family has three models, plus you have performed meritorious service. The back wall of our main room is covered with model certificates and meritorious service reports. It seems that our whole family has become heroes and models. People say that our family is a "model family"!

　　That's not all. In November last year, Xiurong also went to Kaifeng to attend the provincial women's representative conference. After returning, her vision became even broader. At the cooperative members' meeting, she conveyed to everyone the general line of our country during the transition period. What is the general line, how to implement the general line, and what are the benefits of the general line for us farmers... she explained everything clearly. She also used many practical examples to tell everyone the benefits of industrialization for us. She said: Before liberation, one dou of wheat (32 jin) in our area could only buy 5 jin of salt, 2 jin of sesame oil, or 3 chi of black cloth; now it can buy 32 jin of salt, 9 jin of sesame oil, or 12 chi of black cloth. Isn't this all the benefit that Chairman Mao has given to the peasants by leading our country to develop industry! She also said that the planes, cannons, and tanks you use in Korea will all be manufactured by ourselves in the future. I think Chairman Mao's idea is great. But to do so, we farmers must produce more grain and grow more cotton, so that the workers and you have food to eat, the machines can run, and the country can be safe! Rushong, I think you know that to produce more grain, we must take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Otherwise, not to mention supporting you and industrial construction, in the long run, our area will become the same as in the past, where the poor become poorer and the rich become richer, and it will turn into a world of exploitation again. Let's not talk about other things; you know our family's situation. Before liberation, we were oppressed and exploited by others. The family could never make ends meet, and your grandfather was starved to death! In 1947, we rented two dou of grain from someone, and in just a few days, the interest snowballed into more than one shi. Can we ever think about those days again! After liberation, and after joining the cooperative led by your Uncle Youzhong and Uncle Youlun, life has improved day by day. Last year, our family received 800 jin of wheat, 1546 jin of miscellaneous grains, and 3600 jin of sweet potatoes. The cotton we received and sold was enough to buy cloth for clothing.

　　The more I think about the good times now, the more I feel that the general line is right. Your mother, your wife, and I discussed it, and we decided to sell all of our family's surplus grain, 150 jin, and cotton, 5 jin, to the state. Under our leadership, the entire cooperative sold 2350 jin of surplus grain, and the entire village sold more than 12,000 jin! Many individual households, after selling their surplus grain, also requested to join the cooperative or mutual aid group. On December 21st last year, your Grandpa Ancai, Grandpa Anshan, Grandpa Ankun, and your Uncle Youzhi and Uncle Youyu, with the consent of all members of our cooperative, all joined our cooperative. They brought 60 mu of land, three horses, one cow, one cart, and one seven-inch walking plow. Now, the entire cooperative has 82 people and 167 mu of land! On the evening of the 25th, the cooperative held a meeting of new and old members. Everyone re-divided the work and discussed a new production plan, all promising to work harder to produce more grain, support you, and support our country's industrial construction!

### 咱家的余粮都卖给国家了

专栏：寄战士

    咱家的余粮都卖给国家了如松儿：
   去年十一月二日，你娘正在家里和面，准备做面条吃，傍院的你姓妮妹妹气喘喘地跑到咱家，说你在朝鲜前线立了功，立功喜报已经到了合作社里了。她这一说呀，可把你娘慌张坏了，带着两只面手就跑了出去。谁知道，合作社里早挤满了人，正在议论。你娘一进门，也顾不得给别人说话，就叫县上派到咱社里领导生产的同志，把立功喜报上的字念给她听。看着她那乐哈样子，我故意开玩笑地对她说：“孩子立了功，也不能全算做你的功劳，还有我的一份呀！”她还没开口，别的人就抢过去说：“都有份，就是咱全村的人也觉得顶光荣！”
  “要说是光荣呀，全国人民都有份，头一个就得先说是毛主席的功劳！”……
    松儿，打从你参加志愿军，咱家无论生产、学习，都没落过人后。没有参加合作社前，群众都说你参了军，家中人手少，要给咱代耕。如松，你想想，爹又不是不能劳动，为啥要叫人家代耕呢？咱家的地，全由我和你妻秀荣包下来了；有了空，还去帮助人手少的军属耕地。就这样，一九五二年十月，县里把我评为全县的军属模范了。你弟如廷在学校里学习也很用功，老师教过的书，他差不多都会念，会讲，会用。一有空，还到社里帮助大家生产。去年上学期，他也被选为学习模范了。他还说：“我要好好学习，长大了，一定去找哥哥，和他一块打美国鬼子！”要说你妻秀荣呀，她的劲头就更足了。她在社里是妇女组长，处处都带着妇女向前跑。前年五月抗旱时，她领着八个妇女和另外八个男的挑战，结果她们一天就担水浇种了三亩红薯，比男的还多浇种了五分！就在那年六七月间，高粱快要打苞抽穗时，猛不防生了钻心虫，用药水打也不行，她就带领大家用针尖一个个地挑，把害虫全部消灭掉了，每亩平均收了三百六十二斤。那年棉花生虫更多，她就领着全社二十四个妇女，一连捕了二十三遍，结果棉花获得了丰收，每亩平均是三百九十七斤十二两！同时，秀荣也很会料理家事，伺候老人也顶周到。热的，冷的，单的，棉的，她都弄得一是一，二是二，有条有理的，人人都夸她是个好媳妇！一九五二年十一月，她被评为全县的二等爱国劳动模范；十二月，又加入了青年团，成为光荣的青年团员啦！如松，你看，咱家有了三个模范，再加上你也立了功，咱那堂屋的后墙上，不是挂的模范奖状，就是立功喜报。眼看咱家全成了功臣模范啦，人家都说咱是个“模范家庭”哩！
    这还不说，去年十一月间，秀荣还到开封参加了省里的妇女代表大会。回来后，她的见识更广了。她在社员大会上，给大家传达了一下咱们国家过渡时期的总路线。啥叫总路线，咋样实行总路线，总路线对咱农民有什么好处……，她都说得一清二楚。她还拿好多实际事，告诉大家工业化对咱的好处。她说：解放以前，咱这里一斗小麦（三十二斤）只能买五斤盐，或二斤香油，或三尺黑布；如今就能买三十二斤盐，或九斤香油，或十二尺黑布。这还不都是毛主席领导咱们国家发展了工业，给农民的好处！她还说你们在朝鲜用的飞机、大炮、坦克，咱们将来都要能自己制造才行。我想，毛主席这个意思就是好。可是，要这么着做，咱们农民就得多打粮食，多种棉花，叫工人和你们都有饭吃，机器才能转动，国家才能安全呀！如松，我想你会知道的，要多打粮食，非走互助合作的道路不可。要不，不要说支援你们和工业建设，天数长了，咱这里还会和过去一样，穷的穷了，富的富了，又变成个剥削世界。别的不说，咱家的情形你是知道的。解放前受人家压迫，受人家剥削，家里总是下顿接不上上顿，你爷还不是活活地叫饿死了！一九四七年租人家二斗粮食，才几天，驴打滚利钱，就翻了一石多。那种日月还能再想！解放了，又参加了你有忠叔和有伦叔领导的合作社，日子才一天天的好起来。去年咱家就分了八百斤小麦，一千五百四十六斤杂粮，还有三千六百斤红薯，分的棉花卖了买布穿也穿不完。
    越想现在的好光景，就越觉得总路线实在对，我和你娘还有你媳妇合计了一下，就决定把咱家的余粮一百五十斤、棉花五斤，全都卖给国家了。全社在咱带头下，卖了余粮二千三百五十斤，全村就卖了一万两千多斤！好多单干户卖了余粮，还要求参加合作社或互助组。去年十二月二十一日，你安彩爷、安善爷、安坤爷和你有治叔、有玉叔，经过咱社里的全体社员同意，都参加到咱社里来了。他们带来了六十亩地、三匹马、一头牛、一辆大车，还有一张七吋步犁。眼下，全社就有八十二口人，一百六十七亩地了！二十五日晚上，社里召开了个新老社员大会，大家重新分了工，又合计了一下新的生产计划，都保证要更加劲地生产，多打粮食，支援你们，支援咱们国家的工业建设！
