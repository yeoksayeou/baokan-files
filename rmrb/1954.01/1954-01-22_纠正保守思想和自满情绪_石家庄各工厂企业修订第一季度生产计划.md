Correcting Conservative Ideologies and Complacency
    Shijiazhuang Factories and Enterprises Revise First Quarter Production Plans

Shijiazhuang city's factories and enterprises corrected conservative ideologies and complacency, revising production plans to ensure that first-quarter production would be no lower than the fourth-quarter production level of the previous year. Thirteen products, including coke, freight cars, yarn, white cloth, flour, air compressors, and heating boilers, have already reached or exceeded the output of the fourth quarter of last year.

During the revision of the plans, leading cadres of factories and enterprises in Shijiazhuang City went deep into the workshops to investigate, calculate detailed accounts, mobilize the masses to tap potential, and find scientific basis. For example, after calculating detailed accounts, Shijiazhuang Local State-Owned Power Machinery Factory calculated 68,000 man-hours for the entire factory, increasing the output value plan by one-fifth. Shijiazhuang Local State-Owned Flour Mill calculated that after increasing the first grinding, adjusting the flour path, and balancing the wheat preparation equipment, the machine production efficiency could be increased by 22 percent, and the output value increased by 14.8 percent.

During this revision of the plan, in order to ensure that the level of actual production in the first quarter of 1954 was not lower than the fourth quarter of 1953, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held two consecutive meetings of factory and mine cadres from late December of last year, strictly criticizing conservative ideologies such as emphasizing objective difficulties, underestimating favorable factors, and "holding back" and setting the plan on the "safety line." After the meeting, it also organized forces to go deep into some factories and mines to supervise and inspect, helping these factories correct the paralyzing thought that "since the year has just begun, even if there is a little shortfall in the task, there will be time to make it up later." During the inspection, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China paid special attention to two types of units. These are those with no special difficulties but whose plans were lower than the fourth-quarter level of last year, and those whose plans were higher than the fourth quarter of last year, but had great potential and whose plans were obviously too low.

    纠正保守思想和自满情绪
    石家庄各工厂企业修订第一季度生产计划
    石家庄市各工厂企业单位纠正保守思想和自满情绪，修订了生产计划，使第一季生产不低于去年第四季度生产水平。焦炭、货车、纱、白布、面粉、空气压缩机、暖气锅炉等十三种产品，已达到或超过了去年第四季的产量。
    在修订计划中，石家庄市各工厂企业单位领导干部都深入车间摸底，算细账，发动群众挖潜力，找科学根据。如石家庄地方国营动力机械厂经过算细账，全厂算出六万八千个工时，使产值计划提高五分之一。石家庄地方国营面粉总厂算出增加头道磨、调整粉路、平衡制麦设备后，机器生产效率可以提高百分之二十二，产值提高百分之十四点八。
    在这次修订计划时，为了保证一九五四年第一季不低于一九五三年第四季实际生产的水平，中共石家庄市委曾从去年十二月下旬起，连续召开两次厂矿干部会议，严格批判了强调客观困难、过低估计有利因素，和“留一手”、把计划订在“保险线”上等保守思想。会后又组织了力量深入一些厂矿进行督促检查，帮助这些工厂纠正了“认为一年刚开始，即便亏欠一点任务日后也有时间补上”的麻痹思想。检查中，中共石家庄市委特别注意了两种单位。这就是没有特殊困难而计划低于去年第四季水平的，计划虽比去年第四季高，但潜力大，计划显然过低的。（新华社）
