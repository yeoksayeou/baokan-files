    The first phase of the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station's "Cultural Remedial" program for elementary school graduates who did not continue their education has ended.
    The "Cultural Remedial" program, which the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station launched in October 1953 for elementary school graduates who did not continue their education, concluded its first phase on January 22nd. According to statistics from the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, over 2,700 elementary school students tuned into the "Cultural Remedial" program, with over 1,400 of them forming groups for collective study. The students were very diligent, with many drafting individual self-study plans or group study covenants. Many students contacted the radio station teachers via letters, telephone calls, or by sending representatives to ask questions and seek clarification. The self-study group of eight elementary school students from Chunshan Street in Dongchang District listened to the broadcast together every morning and then completed the assignments given by the teachers. They spent the rest of the time helping with household chores or participating in labor, and in the afternoon, they dedicated time to review the exercises and conduct experiments. Many parents and teachers also assisted and tutored the students in their studies.
    At the end of the first phase, the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station assigned winter vacation homework for each subject and organized a winter vacation program, broadcasting stories and entertainment programs for them daily.
    The Southwest Sichuan Opera Troupe's Performance Group Returns from Korea and Performs in Beijing
    Last autumn, the Southwest Sichuan Opera Troupe organized a performance group to participate in the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea for Comfort Performances, putting on 185 shows in Korea for an audience of 169,207 people. The longest performance lasted over eight hours. The lead actress, Chen Shufang, not only went deep into the cooking squads to perform, but also took the initiative to unite the music and stage staff, sparking a wave of challenges and responses.
    After returning to China, in addition to reporting and reception performances, with the help of the capital's literary and art circles, they also organized and researched major and minor operas such as "The Story of the Decorated Building," "The Jade Hairpin," "Interrogation of Hong," and "Returning Boat to the River," as well as Sichuan Opera music. They are now publicly performing operas such as "The Story of the Decorated Building" and "The Story of Willow Shade."
      A Warring States Period Chu Tomb Discovered in the Suburbs of Changsha
    In the autumn of 1953, the Hunan Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee's Cultural Relics Cleaning Team excavated a Warring States period Chu tomb at Yingtian Lake in the suburbs of Changsha. The tomb had four layers: an outer coffin, an inner coffin, an outer casket, and an inner casket. The casket wood was very thick, and there was a layer of preservative white paste mud underneath, so the burial objects were well preserved. The most eye-catching unearthed object was a carved wooden board (called a "ling chuang" in ancient documents) that was 180 cm long, 45 cm wide, and 4 cm thick, with coiled dragon patterns carved on it. The patterns were complex, and the carving was vivid and exquisite. There were also twenty-four bamboo slips unearthed, with legible writing on them. In addition, there were bronze swords, bronze hooks, bronze washbasins, iron shovels, wooden figurines, wooden spears, wooden swords, pottery tripods, and pottery pots. Among them, the lacquer wooden sheath of the bronze sword and the silk ribbons wrapped around the sheath rings were still intact and not decayed. The wooden figurines were all painted with ink, depicting ancient costumes with slanted collars, large sleeves, and long clothes covering the feet, and they were also painted with delicate patterns. These unearthed objects provide material data for the study of ancient Chu script, art, and clothing.
