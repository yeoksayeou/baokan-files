　　Actively Manufacture Waterwheels to Support Farmers' Production
    Workers of Liaoxi Iron Factory and Gansu Machine Repair Factory are actively manufacturing Liberation-style waterwheels to support farmers in increasing grain production.
    Spring droughts frequently occur in Liaoxi and Gansu provinces, seriously affecting agricultural production. Last year, although Liaoxi Iron Factory and Gansu General Machinery Factory produced some waterwheels, they did not completely solve the farmers' difficulties in combating drought. To meet the needs of farmers in 1954, both factories sent cadres in the latter half of last year to understand the farmers' needs for waterwheels and their opinions on the quality of the waterwheels. Liaoxi Iron Factory, based on actual needs, decided to produce 2,000 waterwheels in the first quarter of this year. Gansu Machine Repair Factory sent people to Gaolan Shidong District and other places to conduct on-site research on the farmers' use of waterwheels, and immediately improved the design of certain equipment and specifications after returning.
    After studying the General Line, the workers realized that timely supplying farmers with good quality and low-priced production tools is a concrete action to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, so their enthusiasm for production is even higher. Wang Quanyong of the foundry workshop of Liaoxi Iron Factory said: "Guaranteeing the good quality of waterwheels is helping farmers produce more grain, and farmers can sell more surplus grain to the state to support socialist construction. We must ensure that there are no sand holes in each part, so that the waterwheels are easy to use and durable." At the same time, the factory leaders also strengthened the leadership of production meetings, timely understood the production situation, and solved the problems existing in production. The foundry workshop of Gansu Machine Repair Factory solved the labor organization problem and increased the number of sand boxes, and has cast the base and water scoop of 500 waterwheels two days ahead of schedule. Shi Zhongyi of the carpentry workshop is researching and trial-producing a tool for automatic cutting and automatic retraction. It is estimated that using this tool to dig the eyes on the waterwheel frame can improve work efficiency by three times, which can greatly shorten the waterwheel assembly time and deliver the waterwheels to the farmers earlier.

### 辽西铁工厂和甘肃机器修配厂积极制造水车支援农民生产

　　辽西铁工厂和甘肃机器修配厂
　　积极制造水车支援农民生产
    辽西铁工厂和甘肃机器修配厂职工，积极制造解放式水车，支援农民增产粮食。
    辽西、甘肃两省常发生春旱现象，严重地影响农业生产。去年，辽西铁工厂和甘肃通用机器厂虽曾生产了一部分水车，但没有全部解决农民抗旱的困难。为了满足农民一九五四年的需要，两厂在去年后半年都派干部在当地了解农民对水车的需要量，以及农民对水车质量的意见。辽西铁工厂根据实际需要，确定在今年第一季度生产水车二千台。甘肃机器修配厂派人到皋兰石洞区等地实地研究农民使用水车的情况，回来立刻改进了某些装备和规格的设计。
    职工们学习总路线后，认识到及时供应农民质量好、价格低的生产工具，就是巩固工农联盟的具体行动，所以生产情绪更加高涨。辽西铁工厂翻砂车间王全永说：“保证水车质量好，就是帮助农民多打粮，农民就能把更多的余粮卖给国家，支援社会主义建设。我们要保证每个部件没有砂眼，使水车好使、耐用。”同时，厂的领导也加强了生产会议的领导，及时了解生产情况，解决生产中存在的问题。甘肃机器修配厂翻砂车间，解决了劳动组织问题，增多了砂箱，已提前两天把五百部水车的机座和水簸箕铸出来。木工车间史忠义正在研究试制一种自动吃刀、自动退刀的工具，用这个工具挖水车机架上的眼，估计能提高工作效率三倍，这样就可以大大缩短水车装配时间，提前把水车送到农民手里。
