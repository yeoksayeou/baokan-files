Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 9th (Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent): The Korean-Chinese side's explanation representatives told reporters that many of the actions of the Swiss and Swedish representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) in the East Camp explanation tent were detrimental to their neutral status.

The Korean-Chinese explanation representatives said that the Swiss and Swedish representatives, in their "individual reports," admitted that "some powerful organizations existed" in the southern POW camps, that "these organizations had strict control over the POWs who requested repatriation," and that "several homicides had occurred in the southern camps." However, they not only unreasonably opposed the NNRC taking effective measures to punish and eliminate special agents who used violence to disrupt explanations, coerce and murder POWs who requested repatriation, preventing the POWs from freely exercising their right to repatriation; but also, during the explanation process, they shielded the special agents who disrupted the explanations with various excuses, and arbitrarily interrupted the explanation work.

The Korean-Chinese explanation representatives said that in the explanation tents, the Swiss and Swedish representatives tried their best to shield special agents who pretended to be "POWs" from disrupting the explanations and attacking our explanation representatives with force, allowing them to escape deserved punishment. On November 4th, in Tent No. 31, a special agent attacked our explanation representative with stones. The Indian chairman of the auxiliary body ordered the Indian soldiers to arrest him and keep him in solitary confinement. However, the Swiss and Swedish representatives objected, saying, "The POW did not hit the explanation representative, so arresting him is not in accordance with the conditions." On November 5th, in Tent No. 9, another special agent attempted to attack our explanation representative. When Indian soldiers wanted to impose disciplinary sanctions, the Swiss representative protested, saying, "This is threatening the POWs and not implementing the provisions of the Geneva Convention," and overturned a chair and left the tent, forcing the explanation to be interrupted. On December 23rd, in Tent No. 9, a special agent openly shouted, "I am a special agent, what can you do to me?" When the Indian chairman wanted to isolate him, the Swiss representative intervened, saying: "I did not hear the POW admit that he was a special agent."

The Swiss and Swedish representatives unreasonably described our side's full explanation to the POWs, enabling them to dispel their doubts and return home, as "mental torture," and often used this as an excuse to interrupt the explanation work. On November 4th, the Swiss and Swedish representatives in Tent No. 1 requested to leave the tent nine times on this excuse, making it impossible to carry out the explanation work. On October 17th, when Yue Heidan, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers, requested repatriation for the first time after listening to the explanation, the Swedish representative suggested, "The explanation time is too long, the POW is mentally tortured, and needs to be left alone to consider for five minutes." Later, when Yue Heidan again expressed his desire to be repatriated, the Swedish representative said, "The POW is very tired and delirious, and needs to be kept in solitary confinement." The U.S. propaganda machine gleefully shouted that this was a typical example of "mental torture," but the result was that Yue Heidan still firmly requested repatriation after several days of solitary confinement. The Korean-Chinese explanation representatives said: The "Terms of Reference" stipulate that the explanation representatives have full freedom and convenience to explain to the POWs without any interference. However, the Swiss and Swedish representatives often interfered with the work of our explanation representatives, preventing the explanation work from proceeding smoothly. The Swiss and Swedish representatives did not allow our explanation representatives to say "Taiwan is a part of China's territory" when explaining to the POWs, saying that this was "threatening the POWs"; nor did they allow our explanation representatives to say "Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang," even saying that this was "an attack on a public leader"; even our explanation representatives shaking hands with POWs who applied for repatriation was described as a violation of the "Rules of Procedure." On November 4th, in Tent No. 23, our explanation representative said to the POW, "The people of the motherland and your parents have sent me to talk to you, your parents are looking forward to your return." The Swedish representative unreasonably protested, saying: "How do you know his parents are looking forward to his return? This is a threat to the POW." However, when explanations were given in the Songgok-ri POW camp, the South Korean explanation representatives mentioned the POWs' parents almost every time, but the Swedish representative never said it was a threat. The Swiss and Swedish representatives often used these inexplicable excuses to force the interruption of the explanation work, with November 4th and December 23rd being the most significant. This was because November 4th was the day to explain to the POWs in Camp No. 28. Before these two days, when the NNRC investigated the special agent murderers who killed Zhang Zilong, 28 POWs in Camp No. 28 took the opportunity to apply for repatriation. December 23rd was the day the U.S. side had scheduled to end the explanation work. Two days before this, when the POWs in Camp No. 3 listened to the explanation, 56 POWs applied for repatriation. On these two days, the Swiss and Swedish representatives were particularly afraid that more POWs would request repatriation, and tried their best to interrupt the explanation work with various excuses to reduce the chances of POWs requesting repatriation. According to incomplete statistics, on these two days, the Swiss and Swedish representatives in the various tents raised 121 unreasonable protests, interrupting the explanation 27 times. On December 23rd, in Tent No. 16, after a POW listened to the explanation and applied for repatriation, the Swiss representative unreasonably accused our explanation representative of saying the phrase "liberate Taiwan" to the POW, saying that this was "threatening the POWs," resulting in the auxiliary body interrupting the explanation for 35 minutes for discussion, but in the end this accusation was rejected. The Swiss representative later revealed his secret, saying: "I had to do this, too many POWs were being repatriated."

### 瑞士瑞典代表在解释帐篷中的所作所为

    瑞士瑞典代表在解释帐篷中的所作所为
    【新华社开城九日电】本社特派记者报道：朝中方面的解释代表对记者说：中立国遣返委员会瑞士和瑞典代表在东场里解释帐篷中的许多作为，是有损于他们的中立国身份的。
    朝中解释代表说：瑞士和瑞典代表在其“个别报告”中承认了南部战俘营中“有些强有力的组织存在”，“这些组织对要求遣返的战俘控制很严”，并且“南营里曾发生了好几起凶杀案”。但是，他们不但一直无理反对中立国遣返委员会采取有效措施，惩办和清除以暴力破坏解释、胁迫并谋杀要求遣返的战俘的特务，使得战俘不能自由行使遣返权利；而且在解释过程中，以种种借口庇护破坏解释的特务分子，肆意打断解释工作的进行。
    朝中解释代表说：在解释帐篷中，瑞士、瑞典代表对于冒充“战俘”的特务破坏解释、用武力袭击我方解释代表的行为竭力加以庇护，使之逃脱应得的惩罚。十一月四日，在第三十一号帐篷里，有一名特务用石块袭击我方解释代表，附属机构的印度主席命令印度士兵予以逮捕单独看管，但是，瑞士、瑞典代表却反对说：“战俘并没有打中解释代表，因之逮捕这个战俘是不合条件的。”十一月五日，在第九号帐篷里，又有一名特务企图袭击我方解释代表，印度士兵要施行纪律制裁，瑞士代表竟抗议说：“这是威胁战俘，没有执行日内瓦公约的规定”，并且推翻椅子退出帐篷，迫使解释中断。十二月二十三日，第九号帐篷里，有一个特务公开叫嚣：“我就是特务，你们能把我怎么样。”印度主席要把他隔离看管时，瑞士代表出面干涉说：
  “我没有听见战俘承认自己是特务。”
    瑞士和瑞典代表蛮横无理地把我方对战俘进行充分解释、使之消除疑虑遣返回家说成是“精神折磨”，并且时常以此为借口打断解释工作的进行。十一月四日，在第一号帐篷里的瑞士、瑞典代表，便以这种借口要求退出帐篷九次，使得解释工作无法进行。十月十七日，当志愿军被俘人员岳黑旦听取解释后第一次要求遣返时，瑞典代表就提出：“解释时间太长，战俘精神受到折磨，需要让他单独考虑五分钟。”后来，岳黑旦又表示要求遣返，瑞典代表却说：“战俘已经很累，神志不清，需要将他单独看管。”美方宣传机器曾兴高彩烈地大叫这是“精神折磨”的典型，但是结果是岳黑旦经过几天的单独看管后还是坚决要求遣返。朝中解释代表说：“职权范围”规定解释代表有充分自由与便利向战俘进行解释，而不受任何干扰。但是，瑞士、瑞典代表竟常常干扰我方解释代表的工作，使得解释工作不能顺利进行。瑞士、瑞典代表不允许我方解释代表在对战俘进行解释时说“台湾是中国领土的一部分”，说这是“威胁战俘”；也不允许我方解释代表说“蒋匪帮”，竟说这是什么“对一个公众领袖的攻击”；甚至连我方解释代表与申请遣返的战俘握手，也被说成破坏了“工作细则”。十一月四日，在第二十三号帐篷里，我方的解释代表对战俘说：“祖国人民和你的父母派我来和你谈话，你的父母盼望你回去。”瑞典代表无理地抗议说：
  “你怎么知道他的父母盼望他回去？这是对战俘的威胁。”但是，在松谷里战俘营进行解释时，南朝鲜的解释代表几乎每次都提到战俘的父母，瑞典代表却从未说是威胁。瑞士和瑞典代表经常以这些莫名其妙的借口迫使解释工作中断，其中以十一月四日和十二月二十三日最为显著。因为十一月四日是对第二十八号营场的战俘进行解释。在这两天以前，中立国遣返委员会调查杀害张子龙的特务凶手时，第二十八号营场已有二十八名战俘乘机申请遣返。十二月二十三日是美方预定终止解释工作的一天，在这前两天第三号营场的战俘听取解释时，有五十六名战俘申请遣返。瑞士和瑞典代表在这二天内特别害怕有更多的战俘要求遣返，竭力以种种借口打断解释工作的进行，减少战俘要求遣返的机会。据不完全统计，在这两天内，各个帐篷里的瑞士、瑞典代表提出的无理抗议达一百二十一起，其中中断解释二十七次。十二月二十三日，在第十六号帐篷里，一个战俘听取解释申请遣返后，瑞士代表无理指责我方解释代表对战俘说了“解放台湾”
  一句话，说这是“威胁战俘”，结果迫使附属机构中断解释花了三十五分钟的时间来进行讨论，但是最后这个指责还是被否决了。瑞士代表后来泄露自己心中的秘密说：“我不得不这样做，遣返的战俘太多了。”
