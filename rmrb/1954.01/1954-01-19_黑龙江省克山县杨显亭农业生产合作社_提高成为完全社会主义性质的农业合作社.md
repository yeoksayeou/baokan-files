Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, January 18th: The agricultural production cooperative led by national model worker Yang Xianting in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, has further raised the level of awareness of its members after education on the general line. It has now been upgraded to a fully socialist agricultural production cooperative (i.e., a collective farm), and has been renamed the Shuguang (Dawn) Agricultural Production Cooperative.

Since its establishment in the autumn of 1951, Yang Xianting Agricultural Production Cooperative has achieved year-by-year increases in production and significant increases in income for its members due to the implementation of land cooperation and unified management. This has led the members to ideologically affirm the development prospects of taking the socialist road. Although the cooperative suffered from natural disasters such as drought, flooding, and early frost in 1953, the average grain yield per hectare (15 Chinese mu) still reached 2,254 jin, an increase of 322 jin per hectare compared to 1952. In 1953, each work day yielded more than 37 jin of grain, an increase of 6.4 liang per work day compared to 1952. Through the collective management over the past two years, the members have realized that to make the agricultural production cooperative more solid and to further improve production and living standards, it is necessary to further increase the socialist elements within the cooperative. In December of last year, after studying the general line, the members' socialist ideological awareness was further enhanced. In addition, Yang Xianting, the director of the cooperative, re-introduced the situation of Soviet collective farms, which led all members to demand to take a step forward. After careful discussions among the members and serious study by the Keshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the members' congress decided to turn over land and horses as public property and upgrade to a fully socialist agricultural production cooperative.

Currently, the members of the Yang Xianting Agricultural Production Cooperative are in high spirits. The public property of the 26 member households includes: 185.09 hectares of cultivated land, a set of new-style horse-drawn farm implements, 26 horses, 6 rubber-tired carts and large carts, 34 cattle, 12 pigs, and various old farm implements. In addition, there are more than 20 million yuan in public accumulation funds and public welfare funds. At present, they are actively engaged in winter production and planning for spring plowing.

    黑龙江省克山县杨显亭农业生产合作社
    提高成为完全社会主义性质的农业合作社
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十八日电】黑龙江省克山县全国劳动模范杨显亭领导的农业生产合作社经过总路线教育后，社员觉悟程度进一步提高，现已提高为完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社（即集体农庄），并定名为曙光农业生产合作社。
    杨显亭农业生产合作社从一九五一年秋建立以来，由于实行土地合作，统一经营，生产逐年提高，社员收入显著增加，因而使社员们从思想上肯定了走社会主义道路的发展前途。一九五三年虽然受了干旱、雨涝、早霜等自然灾害，但全社打粮平均每垧（十五市亩）仍达到二千二百五十四斤，比一九五二年每垧地多收三百二十二斤；一九五三年每个劳动日分粮三十七斤多，比一九五二年每个劳动日多分粮六斤四两。社员们在两年来的集体经营过程中，体验到要使农业生产合作社更加巩固，生产和生活更加提高，必须进一步增加社内社会主义因素。去年十二月间，社员们学习了总路线以后，社会主义思想觉悟更有提高，加上该社主任杨显亭再次介绍了苏联集体农庄的情况，因而全体社员都要求向前迈进一步。经过社员的仔细讨论和中共克山县委员会的认真研究，全社社员大会就决定把土地、马匹作价归公，提高成为完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。
    现在杨显亭农业生产合作社的社员情绪都很高涨，二十六户社员的公共财产计有：耕地一百八十五垧零九分，新式马拉农具一套，马二十六匹，胶皮车和大车六辆，牛三十四头，猪十二口，以及各种旧农具等；另外，公积金和公益金还有两千多万元。目前，他们正积极进行冬季生产和筹划春耕事宜。
