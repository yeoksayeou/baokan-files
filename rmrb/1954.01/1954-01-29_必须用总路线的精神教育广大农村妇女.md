To propagate the general line and general task of the state during the transition period to rural women is one of the important tasks in current rural work. It is required that through propaganda, the spontaneous capitalist ideas that are growing in some rural women and the widespread remaining feudal ideas should be gradually eliminated, so that socialist ideas gradually rise to become the dominant ideology; in order to mobilize women and men to work together with one heart and one mind to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a considerable period of time, and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the state's agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce.

The ideological understanding and political attitude of rural women have an important influence on male farmers to varying degrees. This is clearly manifested in the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and grain purchase work: where attention is paid to educating both male and female farmers about the general line, mutual aid and cooperation policies, and grain purchase policies, and where "processing" education is carried out specifically and deeply in response to women's thoughts and demands, and women's political awareness is raised, women can enthusiastically sell surplus grain and other crops to the state together with men, and can actively participate in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. Where attention is not paid to political and ideological education for women, or only general education is carried out as with male farmers, women cannot be widely mobilized, and the development of various tasks will be hindered to a certain extent. When the Feng Baolin mutual aid team in Weibin Township, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, was transformed into an agricultural production cooperative, at the beginning, it only generally paid attention to mobilizing male and female team members to study the mutual aid and cooperation policy and the superiority of cooperatives, but did not pay special attention to understanding women's thoughts and demands, and did not carry out "processing" education in response to women's thoughts. When the day came to sign up for the cooperative as planned, all eleven male farmers agreed to join the cooperative, but five of them were women who were in charge of the family, and they did not agree, so they could not sign up for the cooperative, and other households also encountered women's obstacles to varying degrees, so they could not establish the cooperative according to the planned schedule. This incident educated all the comrades in the work team and the leading backbone of the mutual aid team, and everyone went deep into the families to understand women's thoughts and carry out specific education, held family meetings, and discussed the issue of joining the cooperative. After these efforts, women's thinking was basically sorted out, and male and female farmers unanimously agreed to transfer to the cooperative. This incident vividly illustrates that we must pay attention to carrying out in-depth and specific political and ideological education for women in order to guide women and men to implement the general line and general task of the state during the transition period. Comrade Stalin has long told us: "The political education of working women is of paramount importance now that the power is in the hands of workers and peasants," "Women workers stand shoulder to shoulder with male workers. They and they are engaged in the common cause of building our industry, and if women workers are conscious and politically educated, they will help this common cause." "Rural women stand shoulder to shoulder with farmers. They and they are engaged in the common cause of promoting the development and prosperity of our agriculture. If rural women are freed from ignorance and ignorance, then they will be of great help to this cause." ("Welcoming the Fifth Anniversary of the First Congress of Women Workers and Peasants") Therefore, male and female cadres engaged in rural work must fully recognize that propagating and educating women about the general line has an extremely important role in completing national construction.

In addition to explaining the general content and essence of the general line when propagating the general line and general task of the state during the transition period to rural women, some special propaganda should also be carried out in light of the characteristics of women. For example, we should explain the relationship between realizing the general line and realizing the complete liberation of women, and we should establish a clear idea among the masses of women—only by resolutely implementing the general line and gradually transitioning to a socialist society can we gradually realize the complete liberation of women. The fact that Soviet women are completely liberated has long proved this point. In our country, the increasing socialist and semi-socialist economic factors are also gradually opening up broad avenues for women to participate in social production, and are preparing fundamental conditions for further improving women's status. The development of rural mutual aid and cooperative production has played a significant role in promoting the cause of rural women's liberation: for example, in excellent agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, due to intensive cultivation, land processing, integration of agriculture and sideline occupations, and increased economic crops, the demand for labor is increasing, so women have more opportunities to participate in agricultural labor. In collective labor, through education, patriotism and collectivism rise, political consciousness is raised, and production technology and cultural level can also be improved step by step. Under the conditions of implementing equal value and mutual benefit in mutual aid teams and implementing remuneration according to labor in agricultural production cooperatives, the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women can be realized through education, so as to improve women's economic status and women's enthusiasm for participating in agricultural production. Division of labor between men and women can take care of women's physical strength and housework, and rationally use female labor. The implementation of collective mutual assistance can rationally arrange agricultural affairs and housework on the basis of family harmony and united production, appropriately reduce women's housework labor, and increase women's time to participate in agricultural labor. From this point of view, the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement has opened up broad avenues for women to participate in agricultural production, increased women's contribution to the development of agricultural production, gradually changed the traditional emphasis on men and disregard for women, improved women's status, and improved family relations. Therefore, some female activists in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams said after personally experiencing the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation: "We must cherish cooperatives and mutual aid teams like we cherish our own children."

Therefore, when we regularly publicize and mobilize women to participate in productive labor, we must further educate women in the spirit of the general line: only participating in socialist and socialist component productive labor is conducive to the complete liberation of women. "Lenin and Stalin believed that absorbing women to participate in social production and participate in the labor of socialist production methods is of great significance." (Editorial of the Bolshevik magazine in January 1951—On the Women's Work of Party Organizations) Therefore, "The involvement of women in public socialist production is an extremely important method of completely liberating women." (Sverdlov: "On the New Family") To this end, we must educate rural women to enthusiastically support and actively participate in agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations, participate in supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives. For those women who are currently unwilling to participate in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, or even drag their husbands back, or make troubles that hinder the consolidation and development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, we must educate them well and help them make progress; but we must never hit their enthusiasm for participating in production, let alone force them to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

Regarding the issue of women's housework, there are two incorrect statements among some women cadres: one is that rural women's participation in housework labor has the same value as agricultural labor; one is that the current housework burden of rural women cannot be solved, so they excessively emphasize the importance of publicizing housework labor and relax the publicity and mobilization of women to participate in social production. In fact, women's participation in housework or social labor has different effects on women's liberation. We should educate women to appropriately arrange housework and production activities in accordance with the current needs of national construction, and, where possible, gradually organize public undertakings (such as childcare organizations, etc.) to help women reduce housework burdens in order to increase the possibility of women participating in social production. Some other comrades inappropriately underestimate housework, prematurely hope to socialize housework labor; or do not consider the current housework burden of women very well, and mobilize all women to participate in social production in a uniform manner; or mobilize women who are busy with housework to shoulder too much social labor, so that it hinders the normal life of the whole family, and even damages their own health, which is also wrong. The socialization of housework labor must be gradually resolved with the gradual realization of the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture. Judging from the actual situation in our country today, the country's planned construction has just begun, and it cannot quickly absorb the vast number of women to participate in social production and work, and cannot quickly establish sufficient nurseries, kindergartens and even public canteens for the vast number of women; moreover, some of the housework currently operated by rural women, such as sewing clothes and making shoes, is rural sideline production, such as feeding livestock and grinding, which is a part of agricultural labor, and is therefore necessary for the current development of agricultural production. Mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production must also start from this status quo, and different requirements should be made for women who bear different housework burdens. The socialization of housework labor will take a long time, with many difficulties and a slow process. Therefore, we must firmly remember Lenin's words: "This work will take us many, many years, this work cannot give rapid results, nor will it produce such brilliant results." ("The Tasks of the Soviet Republic's Women Workers' Movement") "This transformation is a very difficult thing, because here, the matter is to transform the most deeply rooted, and has become a habit and has hardened system." ("On International Working Women's Day") We cannot be too hasty, nor can we acquiesce in the status quo and stop moving forward.

We should also publicize to women and to society: We must transition to socialism, we must rely on all men and women, carry forward the spirit of loving the motherland and loving socialism, contribute all our energy and wisdom, find ways, find tricks, work selflessly, and work hard. A happy and fulfilling life is created by selfless labor. Soviet women used this spirit to build and defend their beautiful motherland like men. Before the Patriotic War of Self-Defense, the working days of female collective farm members in Soviet collective farms accounted for about 38 percent of the total working days of men and women in collective farms. By the time of the Patriotic War of Self-Defense, female farm members worked even harder, and in 1943, the working days of female farm members reached 70 percent of the total working days of male and female farm members. Our women, especially working women, have always been diligent and hardworking, and under the encouragement of the beautiful socialist prospect, their enthusiasm for labor has been further improved. For example, the reason why the Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, was able to reduce the harm of natural disasters and achieve increased production last year was also due to the hard work of male and female members. When the summer wheat was ripe, there was a strong wind one evening, and the cooperative immediately mobilized 47 people (9 female members) to rush to harvest more than 40 mu of wheat overnight, so that the wheat was spared from the wind disaster. In the autumn, just when it was busy with farming, the female members picked flowers during the day and moved corn and harvested soybeans by moonlight at night, so the female members did 854 working days, reaching 35 percent of the total working days of the cooperative, which played a significant role in increasing the production of crops and improving the status of women.

In the past two or three months, various localities have created various good publicity experiences in propagating the general line to rural women. In addition to resolutely implementing the policy of mobilizing both men and women together, so that rural women and male farmers can receive education on the general line together, it is also necessary to attach importance to cultivating and using activists through women's organizations to carry out "processing" education for the masses of women. In particular, we must grasp the characteristics of women, and in light of specific ideological situations, explain the spiritual essence of the general line in concrete terms, with examples and simple and easy-to-understand principles that women often hear and see, and to different objects separately. When explaining, we must be very patient, repeatedly explain, and try to adopt a variety of vivid and concrete propaganda forms with sound and color to attract the masses and enhance the publicity effect. In order to make the general line truly penetrate the hearts of the people, it is necessary to combine various specific tasks such as grain purchase, the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and general elections, etc., on the existing basis, to carry out regular, systematic, meticulous and patient publicity to women in order to consolidate and develop the results of publicity and gradually make socialist ideas become the dominant ideology of the rural women's masses.

In the past few years since liberation, the broad masses of rural women have understood from their own personal experience that "listening to the Communist Party is not wrong" and "there is happiness only by following the Communist Party's path." Therefore, where attention is paid to publicizing the general line to rural women, and where it is publicized well, rural women can love the motherland, love socialism, actively participate in the socialist transformation of agriculture, and support socialist industrial construction. Therefore, the party committees at all levels that lead rural work must conscientiously lead the local democratic women's federations, the Communist Youth League, and all male and female cadres who are engaged in rural work to regularly pay attention to propagating the general line to rural women, in order to gradually improve the political and ideological awareness of rural women, so that they and male farmers can actively support and implement the general line and general task of the state during the transition period.

### 必须用总路线的精神教育广大农村妇女

　　必须用总路线的精神教育广大农村妇女
    向农村妇女宣传国家过渡时期的总路线总任务，是当前农村工作中的重要任务之一。要求经过宣传，逐步清除某些农村妇女中正在滋生的自发的资本主义思想和普遍残存的封建思想，使社会主义思想逐步上升为主导的思想；借以动员妇女和男子一起，同心协力，为在一个相当长时期中逐步实现国家社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造而努力。
    农村妇女的思想认识和政治态度，对男农民有着不同程度的重要影响。在开展农村互助合作运动、购粮等工作中很明显地表现出来：那里注意向男女农民一起进行总路线、互助合作政策、购粮政策的教育，并能针对妇女的思想和要求，具体、深入地进行“加工”教育，提高了妇女的政治觉悟，妇女就能和男子一起踊跃地出卖余粮及其他农作物给国家，就能积极参加互助组和农业生产合作社。那里不注意对妇女进行政治思想教育，或者仅仅像对男农民一样，进行一般的教育，妇女就不能普遍发动起来，各种工作的开展就要受到一定程度的阻碍。陕西省咸阳县渭滨乡冯保林互助组转为农业生产合作社时，开始只一般注意了发动男女组员学习互助合作政策和合作社的优越性等问题，但没有特别注意了解妇女的思想和要求，没有针对妇女思想进行“加工”教育，到了预定报名入社的那天，十一户男农民都同意入社，但其中有五户是妇女当家，她们不同意，就不能报名入社，其他各户也或多或少遇到了妇女的阻碍，因而就不能按预定计划建社。这件事教育了工作组全体同志和互助组的领导骨干，大家分别深入家庭，了解妇女的思想，具体进行教育，开家庭会议，商量入社问题。经过这些工作，基本上搞通了妇女的思想，才作到了男女农民一致同意转社。这件事生动地说明：必须注意对妇女进行深入具体的政治思想教育，才能引导妇女和男子一起，贯彻实现国家过渡时期的总路线总任务。斯大林同志早已告诉我们：“当政权已掌握在工农手里的现在，劳动妇女的政治教育具有头等重要的意义”，“女工是和男工肩并肩地站着。她们和他们一起从事建设我国的工业的共同事业，如果女工有了觉悟，受过政治教育，她们便会有助于这一共同事业。”“农妇是和农夫肩并肩地站着。她们和他们一起推动我们的农业发展与繁荣的共同事业。如果农妇摆脱了愚昧无知，那么她们对这一事业会有巨大帮助。”（“迎接第一届女工农妇代表大会五周年”）所以在农村工作的男女干部，都必须充分认识，向妇女进行总路线的宣传教育工作，对于完成国家建设，有极重要的作用。
    向农村妇女宣传国家过渡时期的总路线总任务，除了必须讲明总路线的主要内容、精神实质等一般内容以外，还应针对着妇女的特点进行一些特殊的宣传。比如应该说明实现总路线与实现妇女彻底解放的关系，应该在妇女群众中树立起一个明确的思想——只有坚决贯彻总路线，逐步过渡到社会主义社会，才能逐步实现妇女的彻底解放。苏联妇女彻底解放的事实，早已证明了这一点。在我国，日益增涨的社会主义和半社会主义的经济因素，也正在逐步为妇女参加社会生产开辟宽广的道路，正在为进一步提高妇女地位准备根本的条件。农村互助合作生产的发展，在促进农村妇女解放事业方面，已起了显著的作用：例如在优秀的农业生产合作社及互助组中，由于精耕细作、土地加工、农副业结合以及经济作物增加，劳动力的需要日益增涨，因而妇女参加农业劳动的机会增多了。妇女在集体劳动中，经过教育，爱国主义、集体主义思想上升，政治觉悟提高，生产技术和文化程度也能步步上进。在互助组实行等价互利，农业生产合作社实行按劳取酬的条件之下，经过教育，就可以实现男女劳动同工同酬的原则，提高妇女的经济地位和妇女参加农业生产的积极性。男女分工分业，就能照顾妇女的体力、家务，合理使用女劳动力。实行集体互助，又能在家庭和睦和团结生产的基础上，合理地安排农事与家务，适当减轻妇女的家务劳动，增加了妇女参加农业劳动的时间。由此看来，农业互助合作运动，已为妇女参加农业生产开辟了宽广的道路，增进了妇女对发展农业生产的贡献，逐步改变着重男轻女的传统，提高妇女的地位，改善家庭关系。所以有些农业生产合作社和互助组中的妇女积极分子在亲身体会了互助合作的好处以后说：
  “要像爱自己娃娃一样爱护合作社互助组。”
    因此，我们在经常宣传和发动妇女参加生产劳动时，必须本着总路线的精神，进一步教育妇女：只有参加社会主义的及带有社会主义成份的生产劳动，才有利于妇女彻底解放。“列宁和斯大林认为吸收妇女参加社会生产，参加社会主义生产方式的劳动，是有重大意义的。”（一九五一年一月布尔什维克杂志的社论——论党组织的妇女工作）所以“妇女卷入于公共的社会主义生产，是使妇女彻底解放的极顶重要的方法。”（斯维尔德洛夫：“新家庭论”）为此必须教育农村妇女热烈拥护并积极参加农业互助合作组织，参加供销合作社和信用合作社。对于那些目前还不愿参加农业互助合作运动的、甚至拉丈夫后腿的、闹是非妨碍互助合作组织的巩固与发展的妇女，必须很好地加以教育，帮助她们进步；但决不能打击她们参加生产的积极性，更不能强迫她们参加互助合作组织。
    关于妇女的家务劳动问题，在有些妇女干部中有两种不正确的说法：一种认为农村妇女参加家务劳动与农业劳动有同等的价值；一种认为目前农村妇女的家务牵累无法解决，因而过分强调宣传家务劳动的重要性，放松了宣传动员妇女参加社会生产。实际上，妇女参加家务劳动或社会劳动，对妇女解放的作用来说是不同的。我们应该随着目前国家建设的需要，教育妇女适当地安排家务活和生产活，并在可能条件下，逐步举办帮助妇女减少家务牵累的公共事业（如托儿组织等），以增加妇女参加社会生产的可能。另一些同志不适当地轻视家务，过早地希望家务劳动社会化；或者不很好考虑目前妇女的家务负担，千篇一律地动员所有妇女参加社会生产；或者动员家务繁忙的妇女，担负过重的社会劳动，以致妨害全家正常生活，甚至损害本人的健康，这也是不对的。家务劳动的社会化，必须随着国家社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造的逐步实现，才能逐步解决。就我国今天的实际情况看来，国家计划建设刚刚开端，尚不能很快地吸收广大妇女参加社会生产和工作，不能很快地为广大妇女建立足够的托儿所、幼儿园以至公共食堂等；而且目前农村妇女操作的家务，其中一部分如缝衣做鞋等就是农村副业，如喂牲口、推磨等就是农业劳动的一部分，因而是当前发展农业生产所必要的。发动妇女参加农业生产，也必须从这一个现状出发，对负担不同家务的妇女，应有不同的要求。家务劳动的社会化，要很长的时间，困难多，进程慢。因此我们要牢牢记住列宁的话：“这一工作要使我们花费好多好多年的光阴，这一工作是不能给与迅速的结果，也不会产生这样光辉的效果的。”（“苏维埃共和国女工运动的任务”）“这一转变是一件非常困难的事情，因为在这儿，事情是在于改造那最根深蒂固，而已经成了习惯和已经硬化了的制度。”（“论国际劳动妇女节”）不能操之过急，自然也不能迁就现状，停止不前。
    还应该向妇女和向社会宣传：我们要过渡到社会主义，必须依靠全体男女，发扬热爱祖国、热爱社会主义的精神，贡献自己全部精力和智慧，想办法、找窍门，忘我劳动，艰苦奋斗。幸福美满的生活，是依靠忘我劳动创造出来的。苏联妇女是用这种精神，和男子一样建设和保卫了自己美好的祖国。在爱国自卫战争前，苏联集体农庄的女庄员的劳动日，约占集体农庄男女总劳动日的百分之三十八。到爱国自卫战争时期，女庄员更加奋发劳动，一九四三年女庄员的劳动日竟达男女庄员劳动日总数的百分之七十。我国妇女，特别劳动妇女，一贯是勤劳刻苦的，在社会主义美好远景鼓舞之下，劳动的积极性更加提高了。例如陕西大荔县马廷海农业生产合作社，去年所以能减少天灾的危害达到增产，也是依靠男女社员辛勤劳动的结果。当夏季麦子成熟时，有一天傍晚将刮大风，社里立刻动员四十七人（女社员九人）连夜赶割麦子四十多亩，使麦子免受风灾。秋季，正当农忙的时候，女社员白天拾花，晚上借着月光搬包谷、收?豆，因而女社员做了八百五十四个劳动日，达到全社劳动日总数的百分之三十五，对农作物的增产及提高妇女的地位方面，均起了重大作用。
    最近两、三个月来，各地向农村妇女宣传总路线的工作中，创造了各种各样的很好的宣传经验，除了必须坚决贯彻男女一齐发动的方针，使农村妇女和男农民一起受到总路线的教育外，还必须重视通过妇女组织，培养与运用积极分子，对妇女群众进行“加工”教育。特别要抓住妇女的特点，针对具体的思想情况，分别不同对象，以妇女常闻惯见的事例和浅显易懂的道理，具体讲明总路线的精神实质。讲解时要十分耐心，反复说明，尽量采取多种多样的有声有色的生动具体的宣传形式，以吸引群众，增进宣传效果。为使总路线真正深入人心，必须在现有基础上，结合各项具体的工作如购粮、发展互助合作运动、普选等工作，经常地、有系统地、细致耐心地向妇女宣传，才能巩固和发展宣传的成果，使社会主义思想逐渐成为农村妇女群众的主导思想。
    解放几年来，广大农村妇女从自己亲身体验中懂得了“听共产党的话没错”，“走共产党的路才有幸福”。因此，那里注意了向农村妇女宣传总路线，并宣传得好，那里的农村妇女就能热爱祖国、热爱社会主义、积极参加农业社会主义改造，支援社会主义工业建设。因此领导农村工作的各级党委，必须认真地领导当地民主妇联、青年团及全体农村工作的男女干部，经常注意向农村妇女宣传总路线，借以逐步提高农村妇女的政治思想觉悟，使她们和男农民一起，积极拥护和执行国家过渡时期的总路线总任务。
