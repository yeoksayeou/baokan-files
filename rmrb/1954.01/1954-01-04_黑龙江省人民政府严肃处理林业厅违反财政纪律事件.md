    Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government Seriously Handles the Forestry Department's Violation of Financial Discipline
    Letter from the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government: On July 3rd of last year, reader Jiang Yuchun criticized our province's Forestry Department for seriously violating financial discipline. We are now informing you of the handling of this matter:
    After several re-examinations, verifications, and studies by the joint investigation team of the Provincial People's Government regarding the Forestry Department's violation of financial discipline, it was determined that the error was serious and the loss to the state was enormous. Forestry Department Director Feng Xiaoshan and Afforestation Bureau Director Pang Fuxin should bear direct responsibility for this incident. However, because they were able to deeply reflect on the incident after it occurred, it was decided to handle it leniently and give them a warning. Comrades Wang Shijie and Ma Youbo of the department's Finance Section were able to uphold principles, dared to fight against acts that violated state financial discipline, and actively assisted in providing materials during the work of the joint investigation team. They should be commended in a circular.
    In order to educate all cadres, the course of events and the results of the handling of this incident, in addition to being announced and used for education among all cadres in the Forestry Department, were also instructed to be earnestly organized for study and discussion by governments at all levels and financial and economic enterprises under the jurisdiction of this province in order to learn from the lessons, enhance understanding, and eliminate the occurrence of similar incidents.

    黑龙江省人民政府严肃处理林业厅违反财政纪律事件
    黑龙江省人民政府来信：去年七月三日读者姜玉春批评我省林业厅严重违反财政纪律，现将我们对这个问题处理情况告诉你们：
    我省林业厅违反财政纪律的事件，经省人民政府联合检查组几次复查、对证和研究，认为错误是严重的，给国家所造成的损失是巨大的。林业厅厅长冯肖山、造林局长庞夫辛对此事件应负直接责任。但由于他们在事件发生后能深刻检讨，故决定从宽处理，给以警告处分。该厅财务科王士杰、马又波二同志能坚持原则，敢于和违反国家财政纪律的行为作斗争，在联合检查组进行工作的过程中又积极协助提供材料，应予以通报表扬。
    为了教育全体干部，这个事件的经过和处理结果除在林业厅全体干部中宣布进行教育外，并指示本省所属各级政府及财经企业部门认真组织学习和讨论，以吸取教训，提高认识，杜绝类似事件的发生。
