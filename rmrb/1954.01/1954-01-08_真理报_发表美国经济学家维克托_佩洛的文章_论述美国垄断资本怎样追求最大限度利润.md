Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: On January 4th, "Pravda" published the first part of an article by American economist Victor Perlo, titled "American Monopoly Capitalism's Pursuit of Maximum Profits."

Victor Perlo pointed out that the basic law of modern capitalism discovered by Stalin is currently playing a more obvious role in American monopoly capital than at any time or place. The average profit of American monopoly capital in 1953 was $42.3 billion, compared to only $6.2 billion in 1940. These profits are not only large in number, but also represent the maximum rate of profit. For example, the profit amount of General Motors Corporation for the year ending September 30, 1953, reached 71% of the investment amount.

The author further pointed out that the main source of profits for American companies is the American working people. In the United States, the rate of exploitation of labor has increased very rapidly. In ten major industries, output per work hour has increased by 30% since 1946. Capitalists are constantly devising new ways to intensify labor. Millions of workers have to do extra work in the evenings after completing their daily work. Today, unemployment is increasing, and massive unemployment threatens the "American way of life."

The increasing profits of major companies also come from the continuous impoverishment and bankruptcy of American farmers. The Department of Agriculture estimates that 700,000 farmers went bankrupt between 1942 and 1952. The pressure of monopoly capital on small businesses is also increasing. The total number of companies that closed down in 1953 was about seven times the total number in 1946. Companies are trying to increase their exploitation and plunder of the people by moving factories to areas with low wages and unorganized workers.

Victor Perlo continued, saying that particularly brazen plunder is being carried out through the Eisenhower administration, its "big boss cabinet," and the McCarthy-controlled Congress. It is scheduled for early 1954 that taxes levied on companies and wealthy individuals will be reduced by tens of billions of dollars, while taxes levied on workers with meager wages will be increased.

Approximately 20 million people in the United States are subjected to double exploitation, first as American working people, and secondly as specially oppressed people. Most importantly, there are 15 million Black people. Monopoly capital exploits them in the same way it exploits colonial people. Employers make them do the hardest and most dangerous work, but pay them the lowest wages. A characteristic of American imperialists' plunder of other countries' people is to import these people into the United States on a large scale in order to exploit them within the United States.

American monopoly capital is not only exploiting American residents, but is also expanding "the enslavement and systematic plunder of the people of other countries." According to official figures, American investment abroad was $12 billion in 1940, increasing to $37 billion in 1951. A recent government survey report shows that, according to the survey material, American companies earned more than $3 billion in profits (pre-tax profits) from the $11 billion in direct investment in 1950. From 1946 to 1951, the total number of international investment profits increased by one and a half times. Under these circumstances, is there anything surprising about the Rockefeller family—and former Rockefeller Foundation Chairman Dulles—taking the lead in promoting aggressive foreign policies and opposing the easing of international tensions?

In order to illustrate the insatiable ambition of American companies to seize world hegemony, the author cited an article in the October 31, 1953 issue of "Business Week"—"The World in the Next 25 Years: How the American Economy Will Control the Entire World." "Business Week" pointed out that the possibility of domestic expansion will not be able to meet the requirements of profit. According to the "utopian" plan proposed by this magazine, South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Australia will all become areas controlled by the United States. Perlo pointed out that this economic policy is so shockingly parasitic that its realization will inevitably be hindered by economic crises. The people of Latin America, Africa, and Asia will not allow their wealth to be further plundered, their labor to be exploited, and foreign companies to completely enslave them. The author concluded by saying: A policy of pursuing unattainable goals will ultimately lead to disaster.

### “真理报”发表美国经济学家维克托·佩洛的文章  论述美国垄断资本怎样追求最大限度利润

    “真理报”发表美国经济学家维克托·佩洛的文章
    论述美国垄断资本怎样追求最大限度利润
    据新华社讯：一月四日，“真理报”发表了美国经济学家维克托·佩洛的文章的第一部分，文章的题目是“美国垄断资本主义追求最大限度利润”。
    维克托·佩洛指出，斯大林所发现的现代资本主义的基本法则目前在美国垄断资本方面发生的作用，比在任何地点任何时间发生的作用更加明显。美国垄断资本在一九五三年一年的平均利润是四百二十三亿美元，一九四○年只有六十二亿美元。这些利润不仅数目很大，而且代表了最大限度的利润率，例如通用汽车公司到一九五三年九月三十日为止的这一年的利润数额达投资额的百分之七十一。
    作者进一步指出，美国公司利润的主要来源是美国劳动人民。在美国，对劳动的剥削率非常迅速地增加了。在十个主要工业中，自一九四六年以来，每一个工作小时的产量增加了百分之三十。资本家不断想出新办法来加强劳动强度。有千百万工人在做完了他们的日常工作以后，晚上还要做些额外的工作。今天，失业人数正在增加，大批的失业威胁着“美国生活水平”。
    各大公司的日益增加的利润，也是从美国农民的不断贫困与破产中得来的。农业部估计，在一九四二年到一九五二年之间有七十万农民破产。垄断资本对小企业公司的压力也在增加。一九五三年内倒闭的公司的总数为一九四六年总数的七倍左右。各公司竭力增加对人民的剥削与掠夺，把厂搬到工资低、工人没有组织的地区去。
    维克托·佩洛继续说，特别厚颜无耻的掠夺是通过艾森豪威尔政府、它的“大老板的内阁”和麦卡锡控制的国会进行的。预定在一九五四年初，对公司与富裕的个人所征的赋税要削减好几十亿美元，同时对工资菲薄的工人所征的赋税却要增加。
    美国大约有二千万人受到双重剥削，一层是作为美国劳动人民，再一层是作为受特别压迫的人民。最重要的是一千五百万黑人。垄断资本像剥削殖民地人民一样地剥削他们。雇主们叫他们做最艰苦、最危险的工作，付给他们的却是最菲薄的工资。美帝国主义者掠夺他国人民的一个特点是把这些人民大规模地输入美国，以便在美国境内剥削他们。
    美国垄断资本剥削的还不仅是美国居民，它们还在扩大“对他国人民的奴役和有计划的掠夺”。根据官方数字，美国在外国的投资在一九四○年为一百二十亿美元，一九五一年增加到三百七十亿美元。最近的一个政府调查报告说明，根据调查的材料，美国公司在一九五○年的一百一十亿美元直接投资中获利（未纳税前的利润）三十多亿美元。从一九四六年到一九五一年，国际投资赢利总数增加了一倍半。在这种情况下，洛克菲勒家族——以及前洛克菲勒基金主席杜勒斯——带头提倡侵略性的外交政策，带头反对缓和国际紧张局势，这还有什么奇怪呢？
    为了说明美国公司攫夺世界霸权的无餍的野心，作者援引了一九五三年十月三十一日“商业周刊”的一篇文章——“今后二十五年的世界：美国经济将如何控制全世界”。“商业周刊”指出，国内扩张的可能性将无法满足利润的要求。根据这个杂志提出的“乌托邦”计划，南美、非洲、中东和澳大利亚都将成为美国控制的地区。佩洛指出，这个经济政策有如此惊人的寄生性质，以致它的实现必然会受到经济危机的阻碍。拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲人民不会容许他们的财富进一步遭到掠夺，不会容许他们的劳动受到剥削，不会容许外国公司完全奴役他们。作者最后说：追求不可达到的目的的政策最后只会招致灾难。
