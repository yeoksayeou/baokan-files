Xinhua News Agency report: Rural areas across the country have widely carried out publicity and education on the general line of the state during the transition period to the peasant masses, which has powerfully raised the political consciousness of the peasants and promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement, winter agricultural production, and grain purchase work.

In order to widely carry out the publicity work of the general line, the Party committees and local people's governments at all levels first organized a large number of rural grass-roots cadres, propaganda workers, and mass activists to study the general line. According to incomplete statistics from provinces such as Jilin, Liaoxi, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, and twenty-two counties such as Suzhou Prefecture in Jiangsu Province and Yongning in Guangxi Province, more than 990,000 people participated in the study. Many provinces also conducted key experiments at the beginning of large-scale publicity to gain experience. Many provinces—Jilin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Shandong—carried out publicity through various forms that were popular with farmers, such as tractor farming performances, film and slide shows, picture and physical object exhibitions, and inviting visiting Soviet farmers or labor models to give reports. Then, focusing on issues such as "the two roads of socialism and capitalism," "what are the benefits of socialist industrialization for farmers," and "how do farmers support national economic construction," they used methods from near to far to explain, and mobilized farmers to conduct casual talks, recollections, and comparisons, which yielded great results.

After the general line education, the peasant masses initially distinguished the ideological boundaries between socialism and capitalism, and realized that developing mutual aid and cooperation is the correct way to make all farmers prosperous together, thus clarifying the goals of struggle. Cadres in many areas also examined and criticized their past mistakes of not paying attention to and not actively leading mutual aid and cooperation, and expressed that they would earnestly guide farmers to develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the future. Wherever the publicity work of the general line is done well, this enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation can be seen to varying degrees. After Pu Zhongzhi, a famous agricultural labor model from Wangmang Village in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, promoted the idea to the farmers by using the example of more than 90% of the farmers in the village participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and increasing land yield by 70-80% compared to before liberation, he helped to inspect and rectify the sixteen mutual aid teams in the village, and also helped more than twenty farmers to organize agricultural production cooperatives, and mobilized all 168 farmers in the village to participate in credit cooperatives. Shanxi Province's Pinglu and other three counties originally planned to establish 47 agricultural production cooperatives this year, but farmers voluntarily requested to organize 78. In addition to investing in expanding production, many farmers also invested in rural supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives. During the publicity of the general line, farmers in Linjin and Pinglu counties invested more than 22,300 shares in existing and newly built credit cooperatives, with a total share capital of more than 1.11 billion yuan. In Suiyang, Guiding, Zhenning, Meitan, Lushan, Anshun and other counties in Guizhou Province, many mutual aid teams that had already fallen apart are actively carrying out winter production after being reorganized, and the key mutual aid teams in various counties across the province are also brewing to be transformed into agricultural production cooperatives.

Through systematic education, the peasant masses realized that in order to fundamentally improve their lives and resist natural disasters, they must sell surplus grain to support the country in realizing socialist industrialization. According to their own personal experiences, farmers in various places discussed and concluded that selling surplus grain to the state has six major benefits: First, supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, consolidating national defense, and safeguarding national security; second, helping national economic construction; third, helping the working class brothers step up production, and the workers then supply the farmers with the products they produce; fourth, depositing part of the money in the People's Bank, which not only helps the country accumulate funds, but also gets interest; fifth, ensuring price stability, which benefits everyone; sixth, turning dead grain into living wealth, purchasing means of production, and expanding this year's production. Therefore, farmers are very enthusiastic about selling surplus grain, and the amount sold is increasing month by month. In North China, the surplus grain sold by farmers in November last year increased by 33.15% compared with October, and in the first and middle ten days of December, it exceeded November. According to the figures reported by farmers in Jilin Province, as of December 20 last year, the surplus grain sold has exceeded the grain purchase plan by 15%. Farmers in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, have sold 400 million jin of surplus grain. As of December 12 last year, farmers in Poyang, Fengcheng, and Fuliang counties in Jiangxi Province alone had sold more than 150 million jin of surplus grain to the state.

After visiting factories, mines, tractor farming performances, and industrial product exhibitions, many farmers have realized the importance of the worker-peasant alliance. More than 2,900 new-style waterwheels were installed in rural areas of Jiexian County, Shanxi Province last year, increasing cotton production by three times compared to when no waterwheels were installed in 1950. Farmers in the county unanimously praised this as a result of the help of the working class brothers. Many farmers, after visiting factories, expressed their admiration for the great contributions made by workers to the country. They saw with their own eyes that the agricultural products they produced were used as raw materials for industrial products, and they were very excited. They said: Workers and peasants are one family, and neither can be without the other.

Due to the recognition of the bright future of socialism, the enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved among the farmers in various places. Many farmers are seizing the winter production season to maintain winter wheat and spring crops, accumulate fertilizer, repair farmland water conservancy, protect livestock, and rectify mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In Gaomiao Township, Kaifeng County, Henan Province, 389 mu of land were plowed and 74 carts of fertilizer were accumulated in three days. In the Yuebei area of Guangdong Province, farmers in more than ten counties including Yingde and Nanxiong, in addition to using the money from selling surplus grain to purchase fertilizers and farm tools, also used part of it to invest in water conservancy projects that are starting one after another. In Xinping Township, Zhongshan County, Yuezhong area, in order to increase grain production, the farmers rushed to build 150 mud boats and dug 160 million jin of river mud to fertilize more than 2,000 mu of intercropped paddy fields. It is estimated that after being changed to continuous cropping paddy fields this year, the output can be increased by one time. Many agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers have formulated plans to expand production this year.

    全国农村普遍宣传总路线
    推动了互助合作运动和生产、购粮工作
    据新华社讯：全国各地农村普遍向农民群众开展了国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传教育，有力地提高了农民的政治觉悟，推动了互助合作运动、冬季农业生产和收购粮食工作。
    中共各地党委和各地人民政府等领导机关，为了使总路线的宣传工作广泛地开展起来，首先组织大批农村基层干部、宣传工作人员和群众积极分子学习总路线。仅据吉林、辽西、陕西、广东、贵州等省和江苏省苏州专区、广西省邕宁等二十二县的不完全统计，参加学习的就有九十九万多人。许多省还在大规模展开宣传之初，就专门作了重点试验，以便取得经验。有许多省——吉林、江西、四川、山东，都通过农民喜闻乐见的多种多样形式来进行宣传，例如拖拉机耕作表演，放映电影、幻灯，举行图片实物展览会，邀请访苏农民或劳动模范作报告等，然后围绕“社会主义与资本主义两条道路”、
  “社会主义工业化对农民有什么好处”、“农民怎样支援国家经济建设”等问题，采用由近及远的方法进行讲解，发动农民进行漫谈、回忆和对比，收效极大。
    经过总路线教育后，农民群众初步划清了社会主义与资本主义的思想界限，认识到只有发展互助合作才是使全体农民共同富裕的正确道路，因而明确了奋斗目标。许多地区的干部也检查批判了自己过去不重视和不积极领导互助合作的错误，表示今后要认真引导农民发展互助合作运动。凡是总路线的宣传工作做得较好的地方，都可以看到这种互助合作的积极性程度不同地发挥出来。陕西省长安县王莽村的著名农业劳动模范蒲忠智用全村百分之九十以上的农民参加互助合作组织、土地产量比解放前提高百分之七、八十的事例向农民宣传后，就帮助检查和整顿了全村十六个互助组，还帮助二十多户农民组织农业生产合作社，发动全村一百六十八户农民参加了信用合作社。山西省平陆等三县原计划今年建立四十七个农业生产合作社，但农民自愿要求组织的就有七十八个。许多农民除投资扩大生产外，还投资加入农村供销合作社和信用合作社。临晋、平陆两县农民在宣传总路线期间，在已有的和新建的信用合作社里入了二万二千三百多股，股金总额共十一亿一千多万元。贵州省绥阳、贵定、镇宁、湄潭、炉山、安顺等县不少已经涣散的互助组，经过重新整顿正在积极进行冬季生产，全省各县的重点互助组，也在酝酿改为农业生产合作社。
    经过系统的教育，农民群众认识到要根本改善生活，抗御自然灾害，就要卖出余粮支援国家实现社会主义工业化。各地农民根据自己切身体验，讨论出把余粮卖给国家有六大好处：第一、支援中国人民志愿军和人民解放军，抗美援朝，巩固国防，保卫国家安全；第二、帮助国家经济建设；第三、帮助工人老大哥加紧生产，工人又把生产出来的东西供给农民，帮助农民；第四、把一部分钱存到人民银行，既帮助国家积累资金，自己又得到利息；第五、保证物价稳定，大家都有好处；第六、死粮变成活财，购买生产资料，扩大今年的生产。因此，农民出卖余粮非常踊跃，出卖的数量，逐月逐旬都在增加。华北区各地农民去年十一月份出卖的余粮比十月份增加百分之三十三点一五，十二月上、中两旬，又超过了十一月份。吉林省农民自报出卖余粮的数字，截至去年十二月二十日止，已超过购粮计划百分之十五。江苏省苏州专区农民已出卖余粮四亿斤。江西省到去年十二月十二日止，仅鄱阳、丰城、浮梁等县农民卖给国家的余粮就已超过一亿五千万斤。
    许多农民参观了工厂、矿山、拖拉机耕作表演和工业品展览会后，已认识到工农联盟的重要意义。山西省解县农村中去年安装了二千九百多部新式水车，使棉花产量比一九五零年没安装水车时提高了三倍，该县农民一致称赞这是工人老大哥帮助的结果。不少农民参观工厂后，对工人为国家作出的巨大贡献表示钦佩，他们亲眼看见自己生产的农产品被用来当作工业品的原料，也非常兴奋。他们说：工人、农民就是一家人，缺了那个也不行。
    各地农民由于认识了社会主义美好的前途，生产积极性大大提高。许多农民正抓紧冬季生产季节保养冬麦、小春作物，积肥，整修农田水利，保护牲畜，整顿互助合作组织。河南省开封县高庙乡三天中就犁地三百八十九亩、积肥七十四车。广东省粤北区英德、南雄等十多个县的农民除把出卖余粮的钱购买肥料、农具外，还用一部分投资到正在先后开工的水利工程中去。粤中区中山县新平乡农民为了增产粮食，赶造了一百五十只泥艇，挖了一亿六千斤河泥，给两千多亩间作稻田上了肥料，估计今年改为连作稻田后，可提高产量一倍。有许多农业生产合作社、互助组和农民群众制订了今年扩大生产计划。
