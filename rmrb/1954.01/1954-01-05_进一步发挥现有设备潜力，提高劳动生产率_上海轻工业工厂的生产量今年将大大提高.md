Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 4th: In 1954, the production of Shanghai's state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private light industry factories will increase significantly. According to the plans already determined by these factories, the total planned output value for 1954 will be more than 35% higher than the estimated actual total output value completed in 1953. Among them, the products needed for the people's livelihood and the country's heavy industry construction, such as medicines, fountain pens, sewing machines, drawing instruments, paints, and fire-fighting equipment, will more than double; sulfathiazole, which is of great importance to people's health and can treat various inflammations, will increase eightfold. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, due to the large increase in Shanghai's sulfathiazole production, this type of medicine can achieve self-sufficiency in 1954. The four fountain pen factories in Shanghai, which are locally state-owned and jointly state-private, are expected to produce enough fountain pens in 1954 that, calculated on the basis of China's average population of 500 million, every fifty people could get one pen, which is double the amount in 1953.

    In the process of studying the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, the staff of the Shanghai state-owned and locally state-owned light industry systems clearly recognized the importance of concentrating major efforts on developing heavy industry first. Therefore, when preparing the 1954 plan, they greatly reduced the amount of investment they originally intended to request from the state, and were determined to increase production by further utilizing the potential of existing equipment and increasing labor productivity, in order to gradually meet the needs of the people. For example, when the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Local Industry Bureau discussed the five-year construction plan in the third quarter of last year, it planned to merge and relocate the four fountain pen factories to expand production and increase the annual production of fountain pens to one million dozens. However, when preparing the 1954 plan in the fourth quarter, after repeated discussions and calculations, they found that adding some odd pieces of equipment could solve the problems of unbalanced production equipment and insufficient power. It would also create conditions for adding two shifts, so there would be no need for large investments, and the output in 1954 could be increased to more than 860,000 dozens. In the process of preparing the plan, they also criticized the non-overall view of "not asking for help from anyone." In order to more conveniently supply the plastic needed by the four fountain pen factories to manufacture pen barrels, the Shanghai Municipal Local Industry Bureau once planned to open a plastic factory. Now, they realize that basic construction must be subordinate to the national economic construction plan and should not start from the needs of one department. Therefore, they decided not to open a plastic factory, but to have the Shanghai Municipal Finance and Economics Committee plan the supply in a unified manner. In order to meet the needs of the people and organize production more rationally, some factories will also add some necessary equipment this year. For example, the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory, which produces penicillin, originally planned to add two fermentation tanks. After research by the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government, it was decided to add four fermentation tanks. In this way, the output of procaine penicillin this year will be more than double that of last year.

    When preparing the 1954 plan, due to the work foundation of the first year of the five-year construction plan, leading cadres at all levels were more confident than in previous years. As early as August and September of last year, many factories put forward preliminary plans for 1954 based on production equipment capacity and supply and marketing conditions, for reference by relevant departments of the central government; the relevant departments of the central government also held a series of supply and marketing meetings in the process of preparing the plan. Therefore, this year's production plan is more suitable for the needs of the country and the people, and at the same time, it has given greater play to the favorable conditions in various places, showing that the planned organization of the country's light industry production as a whole has been further strengthened. For example, the canned food production of the state-owned Shanghai Yimin Food Factories No. 1 and No. 2 was originally mainly for domestic sales, but the China National Department Store Company, based on the domestic and foreign sales situation and their better equipment and more skilled technology, discussed with them and agreed that they would mainly produce canned food for export in the future; a large number of meat canned goods for domestic sales would be produced by factories in the Northeast and Southwest, where there is more pork and beef. Some changes in varieties caused by adjusting production and sales have brought some difficulties to the Shanghai Yimin Food Factories No. 1 and No. 2, but they are working hard to overcome these difficulties for the sake of overall interests. Similarly, according to the needs of the people of the whole country and the characteristics of Shanghai's production equipment and technology, the state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private soap factories in Shanghai will increase the production of scented soap by one to one and a half times compared with last year in 1954, while the increase in laundry soap will be less than 50%. The large amount of laundry soap needed by the people will be produced more in other regions.

    At present, relevant departments and factories are carrying out production preparations in full swing. Various specialized companies are contacting various parts of the country to purchase raw materials for Shanghai's light industry. The joint state-private Tianshan Chemical Factory has signed a contract with the Jinxi Chemical Factory in Northeast China to supply carbolic acid as a raw material for bakelite powder. The China Coal Mining and Building Materials Company will transport linden wood from the Northeast as a raw material for pencils.

### 进一步发挥现有设备潜力，提高劳动生产率  上海轻工业工厂的生产量今年将大大提高

    进一步发挥现有设备潜力，提高劳动生产率
    上海轻工业工厂的生产量今年将大大提高
    【新华社上海四日电】一九五四年，上海国营、地方国营、公私合营轻工业工厂的生产将大大提高一步。根据这些厂目前已确定的计划，一九五四年的计划总产值比一九五三年预计完成的实际总产值要高百分之三十五以上。其中为人民生活和国家重工业建设所需要的产品，如医药、金笔、缝纫机、绘图仪器、油漆、消防器材等将增加一倍以上；与人民健康有重大关系的能治疗各种炎症的磺胺噻唑将增加八倍。据中国医药公司上海采购供应站负责人说，由于上海磺胺噻唑的大量增产，一九五四年这一类药品可以做到自给。上海地方国营和公私合营的四个金笔厂一九五四年预计生产的金笔，以全国五亿人口平均计算，每五十个人就可以得到一支，比一九五三年增加一倍。
    在学习国家在过渡时期总路线总任务的过程中，上海国营、地方国营轻工业系统的工作人员，明确认识了首先集中主要力量发展重工业的重要性，因而在编制一九五四年计划时，把原来想要求国家的投资的数字大大缩小了，决心从进一步发挥现有设备的潜力、提高劳动生产率入手来增加生产，逐步满足人民的需要。如上海市人民政府地方工业局在去年第三季度讨论五年建设计划时，曾打算把四个金笔厂合并迁移，扩大生产，使金笔年产量达到一百万打。但在第四季度编制一九五四年计划时，他们经过反复讨论计算，研究出增加一些零星设备就可以解决生产设备不平衡和电力不足等问题，还可以创造条件增开两班，这样就不需要有很大的投资，而一九五四年的产量可以增加到八十六万多打。他们在编制计划中也批判了“万事不求人”的非全局观点。上海市地方工业局为了更方便地供应四个金笔厂制造笔杆所需要的塑胶，曾打算开办一个塑胶厂，现在，他们体会到基本建设要服从全国的经济建设计划，不应从一个部门的需要出发，因而决定不再开办塑胶厂，而由上海市财经委员会统一筹划供应。为了满足人民的需要，更合理地组织生产，有些厂今年也将增添一些必要的设备，如生产青霉素的国营上海第三制药厂，原来计划增添两个发酵罐，后经中央人民政府轻工业部研究，决定增添四个发酵罐，这样，今年普罗卡因青霉素的产量就将比去年提高二倍以上。
    在编制一九五四年计划的时候，由于有了五年建设计划第一年的工作基础，各级领导干部都比往年心中有数。许多厂早在去年八、九月份就根据生产设备能力、供销情况，提出了一九五四年的初步计划，供中央有关部门参考；中央有关部门编制计划中又召开了一系列的供销会议。因而今年的生产计划就比较地更能适合国家和人民的需要，同时也更加发挥了各地的有利条件，显示出整个国家轻工业生产的计划性组织性进一步加强。如国营上海益民食品一、二两厂的罐头生产原来以内销为主，但中国百货公司根据国内外销售的情况和他们的设备较好、技术也比较熟练等条件，和他们商定今后主要生产外销罐头；大量的内销肉类罐头由猪肉、牛肉比较多的东北、西南的工厂生产。因为调整产销而引起的一些品种上的变化，使上海益民食品一、二两厂遇到一些困难，但是为了整体利益，他们正在努力克服这些困难。同样地，根据全国人民的需要和上海生产设备技术上的特点，一九五四年上海国营、地方国营、公私合营的肥皂厂要比去年增产一倍到一倍半的香皂，洗衣皂增加就不到百分之五十。人民所需要的大量洗衣皂，将由其他地区更多地生产。
    目前有关部门和各厂正在紧张地进行生产准备工作。各专业公司正在和全国各地接洽为上海轻工业采购原料，公私合营天山化工厂已和东北的锦西化工厂签订了供应石炭酸作为胶木粉原料的合同。中国煤业建筑器材公司将由东北运来椴木作为铅笔的原料。
