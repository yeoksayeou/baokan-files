    Xinhua News Agency Report: Under the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government, fishermen are being organized to develop fishery production. Over 400,000 fishermen in the province have already formed over 950 mutual aid teams and cooperatives of various forms. These mutual aid and cooperative organizations involve some sharing boats, nets, and labor; some involve temporary cooperation between boats; and some distribute dividends based on shares, labor, and technology, all organized on a voluntary basis by the fishermen.

    Fishermen who have organized have seen significant increases in production, and their lives are better than before. In Lian Island Township, Lianyungang, more than 360 out of 600 fishing households have organized into 15 mutual aid teams. These mutual aid teams implement unified allocation of manpower and tools, leveraging their production potential. They are generally able to overcome natural obstacles such as tides and winter cold to fish at sea. The township's fishery production last year nearly doubled compared to 1952.

    Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government convened a provincial aquatic products work conference. In addition to studying this year's fishery production plans and targets, the conference focused on studying how to further lead fishermen to organize through education on the general line.

    江苏全省有四十多万渔民
    参加互助合作组织
    据新华社讯：江苏省人民政府领导渔民组织起来发展渔业生产。全省有四十多万渔民，已经组成各种形式的互助组、合作社九百五十多个。这些互助合作组织，有的是船、网、劳力互通有无，有的是船和船临时合作，有的按股、按劳力、按技术分红，都是根据渔民自愿组织起来的。
    组织起来的渔民，生产都有显著提高，生活也比以前更好。连云港连岛乡六百多户渔民，先后已有三百六十多户组织了十五个互助组。这些互助组实行人力和工具的统一支配，发挥了生产潜力，一般能够不怕潮、不怕冬寒战胜自然阻力下海捕渔。全乡去年的渔产比一九五二年增加将近一倍。
    最近江苏省人民政府召开全省水产工作会议，除研究今年的渔业生产计划和指标外，着重研究通过总路线的教育进一步领导渔民组织起来。
