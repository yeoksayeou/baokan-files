Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: Recent developments in the demilitarized zone have thoroughly proven the heinous crime of the United States in violating the will of more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and obstructing their return home. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has submitted an interim report on the work of the Commission, describing the use of force and threats of force to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war in the South Camp. This report deals a fatal blow to the deceptive propaganda of the United States, which has dragged out the Korean War for nearly two years. The American lies are "voluntary repatriation," and the reasons are the so-called Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who "would rather die than be repatriated," and "respect for individual rights and human rights." What exactly is this "respect for individual freedom and human dignity," and "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war," which the United States government uses as an excuse to keep the American people and its allies bleeding and fighting in Korea for nearly two years? It turns out to be the most brutal trampling of the rights of prisoners of war, the insult and humiliation of the personal dignity of prisoners of war, making them cowardly creatures. "No forced repatriation" means using all the weapons of "psychological warfare," from thought control and intimidation to barbaric tattooing and murder, to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. This has been clearly proven by the crimes discovered by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the unsightly scars, the shameful marks on the body, the mental disorders, and the three hundred and sixty-nine prisoners of war who returned after explanation or escaped the control of special agents.

The "no forced repatriation" conspiracy to detain prisoners of war, devised by the U.S. Army Psychological Warfare Bureau in Washington in July 1951 when the armistice negotiations were about to be held, has backfired. Because the truth about the terrorist, intimidating, and thought-controlling rule of the special agent organizations in the South Camp of the demilitarized zone has been exposed to the world. Behind these special agents stand three murderers: the United States, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek.

The key point of the U.S. "psychological warfare" plan is: after the prisoners of war are handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force, maintain the detaining party's control and influence over the prisoners of war. This work was carried out by special agents trained in Tokyo and Seoul, who rendered the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission ineffective and made it impossible to implement the "terms of reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." These special agents were protected by the Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, who restricted the Commission by prohibiting the "use of force." These special agents defied the authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force, and even in the explanation tents used loud insults, violence, and threats of force and murder to control the prisoners of war. The subsidiary bodies of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission witnessed firsthand the inner painful struggles of the prisoners of war, whose hearts were torn by the psychology of fear and the desire for repatriation.

As everyone knows, in the southern prisoner-of-war camps, as far as people already know, nineteen prisoners of war who wanted to be repatriated were murdered. Although the special agents distorted the "terms of reference" and "rules of procedure," and threatened the prisoners of war that whoever walked out of the repatriation door would surely be killed by them, although the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force were obstructed by the special agents and failed to inform the prisoners of war of the rights stipulated in the "terms of reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "rules of procedure for explanation and visits," more than 300 prisoners of war risked their lives to break through the control of the special agents and demanded repatriation.

The U.S. propaganda about "respecting individual rights and human dignity" has now gone bankrupt, because after violating the provisions of the "terms of reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and depriving about 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war of the right to hear explanations and apply for repatriation, they unilaterally insisted that the explanation work had ended. After tearing up the "terms of reference," the U.S. government is now resolutely advocating another move that seriously violates the armistice agreement—unilaterally "releasing prisoners of war" at midnight on January 22, without waiting for a political conference to resolve the final disposition of prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated. In order to implement its inhuman plan of forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the U.S. government also ruthlessly disregards the rights of American, British, and South Korean prisoners of war who have requested to continue the explanations.

The sharp contrast between the lives and actions of prisoners of war in the North and South camps is a contrast between the morality of two worlds and two fundamentally different policies towards prisoners of war.

Based on the humanitarian policy of repatriating all prisoners of war, the Korean and Chinese side repeatedly persuaded the American, British, and South Korean prisoners of war formerly in their custody to return home, but the prisoners of war refused to do so. Within nine days, two hundred and twenty-four South Korean prisoners of war listened to the explanations quietly and without restraint. They did not make noise, nor did they carry insulting slogans, but no one wanted to return to the so-called "free world." The Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in the southern prisoner-of-war camps were forbidden to listen to the explanations, while the American, British, and South Korean prisoners of war in the northern prisoner-of-war camps demanded full explanations, but the U.S. side refused to give them further explanations. The whole world can clearly see that only the Korean and Chinese side truly respects the human rights and individual rights of prisoners of war. The U.S. side is trampling on these rights of prisoners of war and wants to forcibly detain them to serve as cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee.

### 中立国遣返委员会提交双方的临时报告  完全证明美方用武力扣留战俘的滔天罪行

    中立国遣返委员会提交双方的临时报告
    完全证明美方用武力扣留战俘的滔天罪行
    【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：非军事区内事态最近的发展彻底证明了美国违反二万多名朝中战俘的意志，阻挠他们回家的滔天罪行。中立国遣返委员会已提出关于委员会工作的临时报告，说明了阻挠南营战俘遣返的武力与武力的威胁的情况，这个报告给拖延朝鲜战争几近两年的美国欺骗宣传以致命的打击，美国的谎话是“自愿遣返”，理由是所谓朝中战俘“宁死也不愿遣返”，和“尊重个人权利与人权”。美国政府借以使得美国人民及其盟国继续在朝鲜流血和打仗几近两年的口实“尊重个人自由与人类尊严”、“不得强迫遣返战俘”到底是什么呢？原来就是最残酷地践踏战俘的权利，侮辱和凌辱战俘的人身尊严，使他们成为胆怯的生物。“不得强迫遣返”就是使尽一切“心理战”的武器，从思想控制、恫吓到野蛮的刺字与杀害，来阻挠战俘遣返。这一点已经从中立国遣返委员会所发现的罪行、难看的伤疤、身体上的可耻的标记、精神错乱以及经过解释后回来的或逃脱特务控制回来的三百六十九个战俘得到了确实的证明。
    华盛顿的美国陆军心理作战局在一九五一年七月停战谈判即将举行的时候想出来的扣留战俘的“不得强迫遣返”的阴谋反而害了自己。因为特务组织在非军事区南营里的恐怖、恫吓与控制思想的统治的真相已经大白于世。在这些特务后面，站着三个凶手：美国、李承晚与蒋介石。
    美国“心理战”计划的要点是：在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队看管以后，维持拘留方对战俘的控制与影响。这个工作是由在东京和汉城训练出来的特务进行的，他们使得中立国遣返委员会失去作用，使得“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”无法执行。这些特务受到中立国遣返委员会中以禁止“使用武力”来束缚委员会的瑞士和瑞典委员的庇护。这些特务藐视中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队的职权，甚至在解释帐篷中也用高声辱骂、行凶，以及武力和谋杀的威胁来控制战俘。中立国遣返委员会的附属机构在解释帐篷中亲眼看到了战俘内心的痛苦斗争，这些战俘的心为恐惧的心理和遣返的愿望所撕裂。
    大家知道，南部战俘营中就人们所已经知道的，有十九名希望遣返的战俘遭到杀害，尽管特务们歪曲“职权范围”和“工作细则”，威吓战俘说谁走出遣返之门，就一定死于他们之手，尽管中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队受到特务的阻挠，未能把“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”所规定的战俘的权利告诉战俘，但是，还是有三百多名战俘冒死突破特务控制要求遣返。
    美方关于“尊重个人权利和人类尊严”的宣传现在已经破产，因为他们在违反“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定、剥夺了约二万名朝中战俘听取解释和申请遣返的权利以后，就片面坚持解释工作已经终止。美国政府在撕毁了“职权范围”以后，现在又坚决主张采取另一严重违反停战协定的举动——在一月二十二日午夜片面“释放战俘”，不等召开政治会议来解决不直接遣返战俘最后的处置问题。为了执行其强迫扣留朝中战俘的非人道计划，美国政府也冷酷无情地无视已经要求继续进行解释的美国、英国和南朝鲜战俘的权利。
    南北战俘营中战俘的生活和举动的尖锐对照，也就是两个世界的道德和两种根本不同的对待战俘的政策的对照。
    朝中方面根据遣返全部战俘的人道主义政策，曾一再劝说以前由他们看管的美国、英国和南朝鲜战俘遣返回家，但是战俘拒绝这样做。在九天之内，有两百二十四名南朝鲜战俘安静地、无拘束地听取了解释。他们没有吵闹，也没有拿着侮辱性的标语，但是没有一个人愿意回到所谓“自由世界”去。南部战俘营中的朝中战俘被人禁止去听取解释，而北部战俘营中的美、英和南朝鲜战俘要求得到充分的解释，但是美方拒绝给他们进一步的解释。全世界可以清楚看到，只有朝中方面真正尊重战俘的人权和个人权利。美方在践踏战俘的这些权利，要强迫扣留他们，以充当蒋介石和李承晚的炮灰。
