The congress discussed and approved the political and organizational resolutions proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India. The congress also passed a resolution on the US-Pakistan military treaty. The resolution said: The purpose of the U.S. ruling clique in surrounding India with war bases is to put pressure on India and force it to join their camp. The resolution pointed out: This treaty will bring the Cold War to India's borders, which will threaten India's peace and national sovereignty. This treaty not only endangers the freedom and independence of other countries, but also endangers the freedom and independence of Pakistan. The resolution called on the Indian people to unite and strongly oppose the US imperialists' blackmail of India in an attempt to force India to follow its war policy.

The congress re-elected the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India. The new Central Committee is composed of 39 members, and Ajoy Ghosh was re-elected as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India.
