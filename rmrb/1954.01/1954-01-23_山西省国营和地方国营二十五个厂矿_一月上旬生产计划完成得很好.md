Shanxi Province's Twenty-Five State-Owned and Local State-Owned Factories and Mines
January's Early Production Plan Completed Very Well

    The twenty-five state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province completed their production plans for the first ten days of the first quarter of this year very well.

    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, one of the largest factories in the province, exceeded the state plan for three out of four major products (pig iron, steel, and steel products). The railway transport department exceeded the state plan for all three indicators except for the standard gauge loading capacity, which fell short of the plan by 0.7 percent. Changzhi Cotton Textile Factory, a local state-owned enterprise, achieved safe, balanced, and over-fulfilled daily plans in all twelve production groups. Other units that overfulfilled their plans for the first ten days of the month include Yangquan Mining Bureau, Datong Power Plant, Taiyuan Cement Plant, and Taiyuan Flour Mill.

    A common characteristic of the units that overfulfilled or completed their plans on schedule for the first ten days of the month is that their attendance rate was no lower than that of the fourth quarter of last year. Taking Changzhi Cotton Textile Factory as an example, the attendance rate of Changzhi Cotton Textile Factory for the ten days was 96.95 percent, which was higher than that of December last year.

    Units that did not complete or did not fully complete their production plans for the first ten days of January include Datong Mining Bureau, Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine, Yangquan Iron Plant, Jinhua and Jinsheng Textile Factories, and Taiyuan Tobacco Factory. Some units failed because of insufficient preparation, poor equipment maintenance planning, and poor maintenance, which affected production. Some units had relatively adequate preparation, but due to a lack of foresight in the implementation of the plan, insufficient estimation of difficulties, and failure to take emergency measures when problems arose, the completion of the plan was affected. In individual units that completed the plan, there was a phenomenon of conservative planning. For example, the Taiyuan Wool Textile Factory's January plan target was less than 50 percent of the December target last year and lower than its existing production capacity. In the first ten days of January, wool yarn production completed 65.36 percent of the monthly plan, and wool blanket production completed 50.86 percent. The phenomenon of not completing the plan or setting conservative plans should be quickly corrected.

    山西省国营和地方国营二十五个厂矿
    一月上旬生产计划完成得很好
    山西省国营和地方国营二十五个厂矿今年第一季度上旬的生产计划完成得很好。
    全省最大的工厂之一太原钢铁厂，四种主要产品中有三种（生铁、钢和钢材）超额完成了国家计划。铁路运输部门除准轨装载量差百分之零点七没完成计划外，其余三个指标都超额完成了国家计划。地方国营长治棉织厂，十二个生产小组都逐日安全、均衡、超额地完成了计划。超额完成上旬计划的还有阳泉矿务局、大同发电厂、太原水泥厂、太原面粉厂等单位。
    超额与按期完成上旬计划的单位，有一个共同的特点：出勤率不低于去年第四季度。拿长治棉织厂作例子，长治棉织厂十天的出勤率是百分之九十六点九五，比去年十二月份提高了。
    没有完成或没有全面完成一月上旬生产计划的单位有大同矿务局、太原西山煤矿、阳泉铁厂、晋华和晋生纺织厂、太原烟草厂等单位。有些单位是因为准备工作不充分，设备检修计划不周，检修不良，影响了生产。有些单位虽然有了比较充分的准备工作，但由于在执行计划中缺乏预见性，对困难估计不足，对发生的问题不能采取紧急措施，结果影响了计划的完成。在完成计划的个别单位中有计划保守的现象。例如太原毛织厂，一月份的计划指标不及去年十二月份指标的百分之五十，也低于现有的生产能力，一月前十天，毛线生产就完成全月计划的百分之六十五点三六，毛毯完成百分之五十点八六。完不成计划或计划订得保守的现象，应迅速纠正。
