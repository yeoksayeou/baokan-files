Xinhua News Agency, January 12th: In the first year of the motherland's Five-Year Construction Plan, dozens of geological prospecting teams under the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government have overfulfilled the annual national plan. They have found new mineral sites for the motherland's heavy industrial construction, and have explored and are exploring the reserves and quality of dozens of mineral sites. The mineral site near Baotou, Suiyuan Province, has been completely confirmed as a rare giant iron ore in the world with extremely large and concentrated mineral deposits and a very high iron content. This iron ore site has convenient transportation and a suitable geographical location. After intensive exploration in 1953, geological personnel have provided preliminary design data from this iron ore for the construction of another modern iron and steel industrial center in our country. Daye is an old iron mine that has been mined for a long time, but people did not truly understand its economic value in the past. After several years, especially the large-scale exploration in 1953, new mining areas and ore layers have been successively discovered and explored in this mining area. Now, the known mineral reserves have greatly increased, and the existing data is sufficient for the preliminary design of a giant steel plant. In order to meet the needs of the development of China's iron and steel industry, the exploration of other mineral raw materials and fluxes needed for ironmaking and steelmaking, such as limestone, refractory clay, quartzite, especially manganese and coking coal, has also achieved many results. The explored manganese ore reserves are sufficient to supply the existing and upcoming new steel plants. Geological workers have also discovered primary manganese deposits in the Central and Southern regions, opening up prospects for manganese ore exploration in our country. The coking coal sites they have discovered and confirmed in several regions have also laid the foundation for the development of steel coking industry in our country. The exploration of non-ferrous metals and engineering geological work have also achieved significant results in 1953.

China's geological prospecting work in 1953 was carried out on an unprecedented scale. According to statistics from the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government, the whole year completed topographic surveys of more than 3,800 square kilometers, geological surveys of more than 27,600 square kilometers, drilling of more than 168,800 meters, trench exploration of more than 418,800 cubic meters, shallow well exploration of more than 26,200 meters, pit exploration of more than 6,300 meters, geophysical prospecting and geochemical prospecting of 376 square kilometers. Through such large-scale exploration, the amount of various minerals required to be explored has overfulfilled the national plan. According to preliminary statistics: iron completed 125.57% of the plan; copper completed 122.42%; lead-zinc completed 166.7%; coal completed 103.59%. In addition, hydrological engineering geological work and other engineering geological work were carried out for the Huaihe River, Yellow River, Hanshui River, Qingshui River, Yongding River and other water conservancy projects.

The abundance of China's underground resources has been further proven from the results of geological prospecting work in 1953. The iron ore in Baotou, Suiyuan, is rare in the world in terms of its quantity, concentration, and mining conditions. The exploration results of manganese ore sites last year proved that China is not a manganese-deficient country. The mercury (quicksilver) mines recently confirmed in the Southwest and Central South regions further indicate that there are huge mercury mines rarely seen in the world hidden underground in our country.

However, these achievements of China's geological prospecting work have not been easily obtained. First of all, this is the result of correctly implementing the policy of great development and great transformation of geological work determined by the Central People's Government. Starting from 1953, China's geological prospecting work was incorporated into the orbit of the national plan for the first time, strictly obeying the needs of national construction, implementing unified and centralized leadership, and changing the past situation of doing as much as possible and being satisfied with indoor research. According to the policy of rapidly increasing strength, in 1953, the geological, drilling, pit exploration, geophysical prospecting, geochemical prospecting, chemical analysis, surveying and mapping, and scientific research teams were built and strengthened. With the care and strong support of the Central People's Government and all parties, the geological prospecting force has grown rapidly. The existing geological prospecting personnel of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government system have increased dozens of times compared with before liberation, and two and a half times compared with 1952. The mechanical equipment required for exploration and testing has also increased significantly. The number of drilling rigs alone has increased five times compared with the beginning of 1952, which is incomparable with the situation where there were only nine drilling rigs in the country during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.

Secondly, it is the result of the direct and enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, and the result of all employees learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Over the past year, Soviet experts have set out to the field many times and personally went to the production areas. From exploration design, construction, sampling, chemical analysis to整理 data and compiling reports, they have provided meticulous and systematic help and guidance, thereby correcting many errors and shortcomings in the work and greatly promoting the development of China's geological prospecting work along the correct path. Taking the Shuikoushan production area as an example, this production area did not produce results after three years of exploration due to the exploration design not conforming to the procedure and the lack of clear objectives. After Soviet experts personally inspected the construction site, they pointed out the errors in the design and salvaged the exploration work in Shuikoushan. Soviet experts not only personally guided but also unreservedly taught the Soviet Union's advanced geological science and technology. 1953 was the year when China's geological community began to study the Soviet Union on a large scale. Through learning and practice, geological workers deeply realized the superiority of the Soviet Union's advanced experience, realized the Soviet geological science's spirit of seeking truth from facts and clear purpose, thereby improving work and improving the quality of work.

    地质勘探工作去年获得重大成绩
    为国家重工业建设找到了许多新的矿产地
   【新华社十二日讯】在祖国五年建设计划的第一年，中央人民政府地质部所属数十支地质勘探队伍已超额完成了全年国家计划，为祖国重工业建设找到了新的矿产地，并探明了和正在探明着几十个矿产地的储量和质量情况。绥远省包头附近的矿产地，已经完全证实是一个矿量极大而又集中、含铁率很高的世界上少有的巨大铁矿，这个铁矿产地交通运输方便，地理位置也适当。经过一九五三年紧张的勘探，地质人员已经从这个铁矿提供出建设我国另一个现代化钢铁工业中心所需要的初步设计资料。大冶是早就开采过的老铁矿，但人们过去并不真正了解它的经济价值。经过几年来，特别是一九五三年的大规模的勘探，这个矿产地里的新矿区和矿层已陆续发现和探明，现在，已知矿量大大增加，现有资料就足可供初步设计巨型钢铁厂之用。适应我国钢铁工业发展的需要，炼铁、炼钢需要的其他矿物原料和熔剂如石灰石、耐火黏土、石英岩等，特别是锰和炼焦煤的勘探，也已取得许多的成绩。已经探明的锰矿量已足够供给目前和即将设计的新钢铁厂之用。地质工作人员并在中南地区发现了原生的锰矿床，为我国锰矿勘探开拓了远景。他们在若干地区发现和证实的炼焦煤产地，也已为我国发展钢铁炼焦工业奠定了基础。有色金属的勘探和工程地质工作，在一九五三年也都获得了重大成绩。
    我国一九五三年的地质勘探工作，是在空前规模上进行的。据中央人民政府地质部统计，全年共完成地形测量三千八百多平方公里，地质测量二万七千六百多平方公里，钻探十六万八千八百多公尺，槽探四十一万八千八百多立方公尺，浅井探二万六千二百多公尺，坑探六千三百多公尺，地球物理探矿和地球化学探矿三百七十六平方公里。经过这样大规模的勘探，各种矿产要求探明的矿量都超额完成了国家计划。据初步统计：铁完成计划百分之一百二十五点五七；铜完成百分之一百二十二点四二；铅锌完成百分之一百六十六点七；煤完成百分之一百零三点五九。此外，并进行了淮河、黄河、汉水、清水河、永定河等水利工程地质工作和其他工程地质工作。
    我国地下资源的十分丰富，从一九五三年地质勘探工作的结果中，得到了进一步的证明。绥远包头的铁矿，就其数量，就其集中程度和开采的条件等等来说，都是世界上少有的。去年锰矿产地的勘探结果，证明我国并不是一个缺锰的国家。最近在西南和中南等地证实的汞（水银）矿，更说明在我国的地下还蕴藏有世界上罕有的巨大的汞矿。
    但是，我国地质勘探工作的这些成绩也不是轻易得来的。首先，这是正确地执行了中央人民政府确定的地质工作大发展、大转变的方针的结果。从一九五三年开始，我国地质勘探工作第一次纳入了国家计划的轨道，严格服从国家建设需要，实行统一集中的领导，转变了过去作多少算多少和满足于室内研究的状况。根据迅速增长力量的方针，一九五三年建设和壮大了地质、钻探、坑探、地球物理探矿、地球化学探矿、化验分析、测绘和科学研究的队伍。在中央人民政府和各方面的关怀和大力支持下，地质勘探力量增长很快，中央人民政府地质部系统的现有地质勘探人员数，比解放前增加了数十倍，比一九五二年也增加了两倍半。勘探、化验所需的机械设备也有大量增加，只钻机一项就比一九五二年初增加了五倍，和国民党反动统治时代全国只有九台钻机的情况，更是不可比拟了。
    其次，是苏联专家直接的热诚帮助的结果，是全体职工学习了苏联先进经验的结果。一年来，苏联专家曾多次出发野外，亲到产地，从勘探设计、施工、采样、化验分析到整理资料、编写报告，都给予了无微不至的系统的帮助和指导，从而纠正了工作中的许多错误和缺点，大大推进了我国地质勘探工作循着正确的道路发展。以水口山产地为例，这个产地由于勘探设计不合程序，目的性不明，以致勘察三年而无结果。苏联专家亲到工地察看以后，指出了设计上的错误，挽回了水口山的勘探工作。苏联专家不仅亲自指导，而且毫无保留地传授了苏联先进的地质科学技术。一九五三年，是我国地质界开始大规模地学习苏联的一年。经过学习和实践，地质工作者深深体会到苏联先进经验的优越，体会到苏联地质科学的实事求是精神、明确的目的性，从而改进了工作，提高了工作的质量。
