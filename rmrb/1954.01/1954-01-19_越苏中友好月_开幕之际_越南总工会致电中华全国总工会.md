(Xinhua News Agency, 18th) On the occasion of the opening of the "Vietnam-Soviet Union-China Friendship Month," the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor sent a telegram to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to express its respect. The telegram is as follows:
All-China Federation of Trade Unions:
    On the joyous occasion of the opening of the Vietnam-Soviet Union-China Friendship Month, on behalf of the Vietnamese working people, we extend our warm respects to you and kindly ask you to convey the deep gratitude of the Vietnamese working people to the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and the Chinese working people.
    In the historical process of the Chinese and Vietnamese revolutionary struggles, the people of Vietnam and China have close relations. By learning from the valuable revolutionary experiences of the Soviet Union and China, the August Revolution in Vietnam achieved victory, liberating the Vietnamese people and freeing them from the evil rule of imperialism and feudalism. The heroic struggle of the Chinese working people and the entire people in the great Liberation War, the tremendous contributions of the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, their courageous fighting spirit and brilliant victories, and the happy life of the Chinese people after the completion of land reform are all powerful encouragement to the Vietnamese people, making them more actively overcome all difficulties, promote the war of resistance, develop production, and support the vast number of farmers in realizing land reform. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance has continuously received the sympathy and support of the Chinese working people and the entire people. For example, the enthusiasm shown by the people from all over China on December 19, 1953, during the Support Vietnam People's Struggle Day, has more powerfully encouraged the Vietnamese people. This time, the Vietnam-Soviet Union-China Friendship Month will strengthen the Vietnamese people's active learning of the Chinese workers' and people's spirit of patriotism and proletarian internationalism, heroic fighting will, and valuable experience in production, and strengthen the solidarity and friendship between the workers and people of Vietnam and China. With the enthusiastic support of the people of the world peace and democracy camp, especially the people of the Soviet Union and China, and under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese people's struggle against French and American imperialism and to abolish the feudal exploitation system will surely be victorious.
    Long live the eternal friendship of the people of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China!
    Long live the great construction success of China!
        Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor

    “越苏中友好月”开幕之际
    越南总工会致电中华全国总工会
   【新华社十八日讯】越南总工会在越苏中友好月开幕之际，致电中华全国总工会表示敬意。电文如下：中华全国总工会：
    欣逢越苏中友好月开幕之际，谨代表越南劳动人民向您们致以热烈的敬意，并请您们转达越南劳动人民对敬爱的毛泽东主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府以及中国劳动人民深切的谢意。
    在中国革命和越南革命斗争的历史过程中，越中两国人民有着密切的关系。由于学习苏联和中国宝贵的革命经验，越南八月革命获得了胜利，解放了越南人民，使他们挣脱了帝国主义和封建主义的罪恶统治。中国劳动人民和全体人民在伟大的解放战争中所作出的英勇的斗争，中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝中所作出的巨大的贡献和他们勇敢的战斗精神和光辉的胜利，以及中国人民在完成土地改革后所获得的幸福的生活，这些对越南人民来说都是一种有力的鼓舞，使他们更加积极地克服一切困难，推进抗战，发展生产，并支持广大农民实现土地改革。越南人民的抗战不断地获得中国劳动人民和全体人民的同情与支持。如一九五三年十二月十九日，中国各地人民所举行的支援越南人民斗争日的热情，都更有力地鼓舞着越南人民。这一次所举行的越苏中友好月，将加强越南人民积极学习中国工人和人民的爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的精神，英勇的战斗意志和生产中的宝贵经验，加强越中两国工人和人民之间的团结友谊。在世界和平民主阵营人民，尤其是苏联和中国人民的热烈支持下，在胡志明主席和越南劳动党的英明领导下，越南人民反对法、美帝国主义、废除封建剥削制度的斗争必定会获得胜利。
    越苏中三国人民的永恒友谊万岁！
    中国伟大的建设成功万岁！
        越南总工会中央委员会主席　黄国越
