Xinhua News Agency report:
    State-owned trading companies in the Lancang Lahu Autonomous Region, Yunnan Province, are actively developing their business to further assist people of all ethnic groups in developing production and improving their lives. Currently, the number of trade teams established by the trading company has increased by one-third compared to 1952, and thirteen consignment shops have been established. The number of trade cadres has also increased by one and a half times, with ethnic minority trade cadres accounting for more than 20% of the total number of cadres.
    The Lancang Lahu Autonomous Region is located on the frontier of our country. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation and difficult material supply, the means of production and daily necessities needed by the people of all ethnic groups were very scarce. Last year, the local trading company expanded its material supply work, dispatching cadres to organize the purchase of goods in Xiaguan, Midu, Menghua and other places, transporting more than 1.4 million jin of materials, more than three times the amount in 1952. Over the past year, the trading company has supplied more than one million jin of edible salt and a large amount of cotton cloth, hoes, etc. On average, the trading company supplies one piece of farm equipment for every two households in the autonomous region. In order to do a good job in winter material supply, the trading company formulated a plan in July and August of last year. In addition to actively transferring materials from other places, the company also purchased and processed materials locally according to the varieties and quality of various production tools and daily necessities needed by the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region. It signed supply and purchase contracts with local small iron factories, weaving factories, and handicraft households, with the trading company providing raw materials and organizing them to process and produce cotton cloth, plowshares, hoes, and iron pots, etc. In November of last year, the value of goods shipped by the trading company to various supply and marketing stores reached 860 million yuan, including more than 11,000 hoes and more than 1,800 pieces of blue and white homespun cloth.

    澜沧拉祜族自治区国营贸易机构
    帮助各族人民发展生产
      云南省澜沧拉祜族自治区国营贸易公司积极开展业务，进一步帮助各族人民发展生产，改善生活。现在，贸易公司设立的贸易小组比一九五二年增加了三分之一，并设立了十三个代销店，贸易干部也增加了一倍半，其中少数民族贸易干部占干部总数的百分之二十以上。
    澜沧拉祜族自治区位于祖国的边疆，过去因交通不便，物资供应困难，各族人民所需要的生产资料和生活用品都很缺乏。当地贸易公司去年扩大物资供应工作，先后派出干部组织牲畜到下关、弥渡、蒙化等地采购货物，运入物资一百四十多万斤，比一九五二年增加三倍多。贸易公司一年来供应了一百万多斤食盐和大量的棉布、锄头等，自治区平均每两户人家就有贸易公司供应的一件农具。为了做好冬季物资供应工作，贸易公司在去年七、八月间就订出了计划，除积极从外地调运物资外，并根据自治区各族人民需要的各种生产工具和生活资料的品种、质量等，就地收购加工，和当地的小型铁厂、织布厂以及手工业户订立了供应收购合同，由贸易公司供给原料，组织他们加工制成棉布、犁铧、锄头和铁锅等。在去年十一月份，贸易公司运往各供销商店的货物价值达八亿六千多万元，其中有锄头一万一千多把，蓝、白土布一千八百多件。
