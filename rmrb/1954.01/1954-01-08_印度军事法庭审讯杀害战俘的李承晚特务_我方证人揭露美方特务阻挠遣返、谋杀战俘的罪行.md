(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th) The trial of eight Syngman Rhee agents connected to a murder case, held today at the headquarters of the Indian Custodial Force, revealed for the first time evidence of how four Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Camp 38 of the Southern Camp were brutally murdered for wanting to be repatriated. Three defendants appeared before the Indian military tribunal this morning.

The Indian prosecutor, reading the indictment against the defendants, explained the background of the murder case. He said: "Among the approximately 500 prisoners of war in this camp, five prisoners of war planned to find a way to be repatriated before arriving at the demilitarized zone. Everyone agreed not to reveal each other's names." However, when their plan was discovered by agents planted by the US side at the beginning of last month, the five prisoners of war were sent to the "camp security team's" tents. These "camp security teams" were organized by the US military authorities to prevent their repatriation before the prisoners of war were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The prosecutor said that the five prisoners of war were tortured there and had anti-communist slogans tattooed on them. Later, the five prisoners of war were closely guarded, but one of them—Yoon Hyung-il—managed to climb over the barbed wire and escape at 6:00 PM on December 12th last year.

Several hours after Yoon Hyung-il escaped, Indian guards in a nearby guard tower saw about twenty-five people dragging heavy objects inside the camp. Later, four corpses were found in the alleyway outside the camp. During an investigation conducted by the Indian Custodial Force the next morning, many prisoners of war ran out of the camp to identify the murderers.

Yoon Hyung-il, the prisoner of war who escaped from the camp, was brought to court to testify. He said: "The five of us planned to return to North Korea as long as we had the opportunity to be heard." When asked if they could get a chance to be heard, he replied: "No. We had no chance. So we planned to escape. But our plan was discovered."

Yoon Hyung-il said that after lunch on December 12th, he saw the agents empty the tents, even removing all the floors. He continued: "I knew that emptying the tents was for the purpose of killing us. So after dinner, I pretended to practice parallel bars near the barbed wire and escaped."

Yoon Hyung-il had gone with the Indian Custodial Force on December 13th to investigate the murder in the camp. He said that he did not see any of his four friends among the prisoners of war who were taken to the alleyway. He continued: "Two days later, I saw their bodies in the hospital."

Before the court adjourned, Yoon Hyung-il took off his clothes to show the judges and members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission the words that had been forcibly tattooed on his body. A South Korean flag was tattooed on his back, the words "Anti-Communist" were tattooed on his left arm, and the words "Until Death" were tattooed on his right arm.

Yoon Hyung-il had been a "security team member." According to him, there was a guard post in every corner of his camp. He said the duty of the "security team members" was to "catch any prisoners of war who tried to escape and immobilize them."

Two US "lawyers" and a large number of Syngman Rhee gang officers participating in the trial as "defense lawyers" tried their best to obstruct the trial today. One Syngman Rhee gang officer spent nearly two hours speaking, trying to prove that the Indian Custodial Force was not qualified to conduct the trial. He said that the Indian Custodial Force was "a custodial party" and "not a detaining party." This baseless claim was rejected by the court, which held that the Indian Custodial Force was entitled to try the murderers under the "Terms of Reference" and other international conventions.

The two US "defense lawyers" repeatedly interrupted the trial, but without success. When witness Yoon Hyung-il spoke in court about how he and his four friends were forced to be tattooed and write blood letters, a uniformed "civilian defense lawyer" said he was "too far off topic." The Indian military judge cited Indian military law and other laws to prove that the witness could do so. The US objections were rejected by the court.

    印度军事法庭审讯杀害战俘的李承晚特务
    我方证人揭露美方特务阻挠遣返、谋杀战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城六日电】今天在印度看管部队总部进行的对与谋杀案有关的八个李承晚特务的审讯，第一次透露了南营第三十八号营场的四个朝鲜人民军战俘如何因为希望遣返而惨遭杀害的证据。有三个被告今天早晨出席了印度军事法庭。
    宣读对被告的控诉状的印度检察官说明了这个谋杀案的背景。他说：“在这个营场里的约五百名战俘中，有五名战俘在来到非军事区以前就打算设法获得遣返。每个人都同意不泄露别人的姓名。”但是当他们的计划在上月初被美方所布置的特务发现了时，这五名战俘就被送到“营场警备队”的帐篷里。这些“营场警备队”是在战俘们被交给中立国遣返委员会看管以前美军当局为了防止他们遣返而组织起来的。检察官说，这五名战俘就在那里遭到拷打，并被刺上反共口号。后来，这五名战俘就被严密地看守起来，但是其中一个人——尹亨日——在去年十二月十二日下午六时设法爬过了铁丝网，逃了出来。
    在尹亨日逃跑了以后几小时，在附近一个守卫塔上的印度卫兵看到约有二十五个人在营场里面拖着一些沉重的东西。后来在营场外的夹道中发现了四具尸体。在印度看管部队次日早晨进行调查时，有许多战俘跑出营场来指明凶手。
    由营场逃出来的战俘尹亨日被带到了法庭来作证。他说：“我们五个人曾计划只要我们有机会听取解释，就要回北朝鲜。”在向他问到他们能否获得听取解释的机会时，他回答说：“没有。我们没有机会。因此我们计划逃跑。但是我们的计划被发现了。”
    尹亨日说，十二月十二日午饭后，他看到特务们把帐篷里的东西搬空，连所有地板都搬走了。他接着说：“我知道把东西搬空是为了杀害我们。因此我在晚饭后就假装到铁丝网附近去练双杠，结果逃掉了。”
    尹亨日在十二月十三日曾和印度看管部队一同去调查营场里的谋杀事件。他说，在被带到夹道里去的战俘中没有看到他的四个朋友中的任何一个人。他接着说：“两天以后，我在医院中看到了他们的尸体。”
    在法庭闭庭以前，尹亨日脱去衣服，让法官和中立国遣返委员会委员看他身上被强迫刺上的字。他的背上刺着一面南朝鲜的旗子，左臂上刺着“反共”二字，右臂上刺着“至死”二字。
    尹亨日曾做过“警备队员”。据他说，在他那个营场的各个角落都有一个警卫哨。他说“警备队员”的职责是“抓住任何企图逃走的战俘，使他们动弹不得”。
    两个美方“律师”和以“辩护律师”身分参加审讯的大批李承晚匪帮军官，今天竭力阻挠审讯的进行。一个李承晚匪帮的军官花了将近两小时的时间发言，企图证明印度看管部队没有资格进行审讯。他说印度看管部队是“看管一方”，而“不是拘留一方”。这种毫无根据的说法受到法庭的驳斥，法庭认为根据“职权范围”和其他国际规约，印度看管部队有权审讯凶手。
    两个美方“辩护律师”一再打断审讯的进程，但是没有得逞。当证人尹亨日在法庭上说到他和他的四个朋友被迫刺字和写血书的情形的时候，一个穿军服的“民事辩护律师”说他“离题太远了”。印度军法官引证印度军法和其他法律证明证人是可以这样做的。美方的反对意见受到了法庭的驳斥。
