    Northeast Region Completes Pilot Work on Establishing Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Creating Preliminary Experience for Large-Scale Cooperative Building

    The Northeast region has completed its pilot work for establishing agricultural production cooperatives this year, creating preliminary experience for the region's cooperative building work this year.

    The Northeast region plans to establish approximately 7,700 new agricultural production cooperatives this year. In order to do a good job in building cooperatives, various localities, in conjunction with grain procurement and in-depth publicity of the General Line, carried out pilot work on building cooperatives last winter. By the end of last year, the pilot work in various provinces had been completed, and 1,246 agricultural production cooperatives had been established. Currently, these new cooperatives, like the old cooperatives, are actively engaged in winter production and are driving mutual aid teams to prepare for spring plowing.

    The experiences gained by various localities in the pilot work of building cooperatives are: (1) The process of building cooperatives should also be a process of summarizing production and mobilizing farmers to produce. In Heilongjiang, Jilin, and other provinces, most of the cooperative building adopted the approach of first summarizing the production of mutual aid teams, making farmers aware of the benefits of being organized, and how to establish agricultural production cooperatives to further improve production. After the new cooperative is established, they help them to do a good job in winter production and annual agricultural and sideline production plans, so that the cooperative can immediately engage in production as soon as it is established. (2) The process of building cooperatives should be a process of educating members and the vast number of farmers outside the cooperative to take the socialist road. Although the targets for pilot cooperative building in various localities were mostly better year-round mutual aid teams, the core members and general farmers, young and old people, men and women, still had different levels of awareness, and therefore, their motivations for joining the cooperative were different. Farmers outside the cooperative had even less understanding of agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, various localities adopted methods such as general meetings, small meetings, and family meetings to conduct in-depth education on the General Line and the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Production Cooperatives" formulated by the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and used specific examples of local original agricultural production cooperatives to explain the purpose, future, and superiority of building cooperatives, as well as the principle of voluntarism that must be observed in building cooperatives. This improved the awareness of the farmers building the cooperatives and the farmers outside the cooperatives, clarified their various doubts, and overcame the tendency of building cooperatives in isolation, so that the agricultural production cooperatives had contact with farmers outside the cooperatives as soon as they were established, which facilitated the expansion of influence. (3) Policies should be thoroughly and meticulously implemented in the process of building cooperatives. The issues that farmers are most concerned about in building cooperatives are the disposal of means of production (mainly carts and horses) and whether they can increase their income. Households with carts and horses and households without carts and horses, households with more land and households with less land, and households with strong labor forces and households with weak labor forces have different concerns. Therefore, when dealing with these issues, all localities based themselves on policies, mobilized members to conduct democratic discussions, and made appropriate arrangements according to specific circumstances. In the 72 newly built agricultural production cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province, the handling of carts and horses mostly adopted the form of leasing according to the wishes of the members, making all the farmers who joined the cooperative satisfied. The newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Jilin Province, based on various conditions, calculated the possible income, properly determined the income distribution method, and took into account both the growth of socialist components in the cooperative and the development of production, as well as ensuring that all members could obtain reasonable benefits, so that members saw the benefits of joining the cooperative from the beginning, which increased their labor enthusiasm. (4) The process of building cooperatives is the best opportunity to train and cultivate cadres and improve the leadership ability of district and village cadres. In general, all localities carry out their work through the Communist Party branch in the village, and absorb the participation of party members from the village branch from beginning to end. After the new cooperative is built, the village branch is taught how to lead the cooperative. In this way, after the cadres sent by the county and district to build the cooperative leave, the village branch can be responsible for the leadership. Jilin, Liaodong, Heilongjiang, Liaoxi, and other provinces have thus enabled the newly built cooperatives to receive timely leadership from the village branch. (5) Promote the progress of mutual aid teams through the construction of cooperatives. In many areas, because the farmers were clearly informed during the construction of the cooperatives that running the mutual aid teams well was the foundation for building the cooperatives, the farmers in the mutual aid teams saw their own development prospects, and consciously helped the mutual aid teams to solve existing problems, so the mutual aid teams were also more consolidated.

    Currently, various parts of Northeast China are continuing to train cadres, impart cooperative building experience, and will complete the cooperative building work in batches before the spring plowing.

### 东北区完成建立农业生产合作社试点工作  创造了大规模建社的初步经验

    东北区完成建立农业生产合作社试点工作
    创造了大规模建社的初步经验
    东北区各地已完成今年建立农业生产合作社的试点工作，为全区今年的建社工作创造了初步经验。
    东北区今年计划新建七千七百个左右的农业生产合作社。为了做好建社工作，各地在去年冬季，即结合购粮和深入宣传总路线，进行了建社试点工作。到去年年底，各省的试点工作都已结束，已建成了一千二百四十六个农业生产合作社。目前，这些新社，正和老社一样，积极进行冬季生产，并带动互助组进行春耕准备。
    各地在建社试点工作中取得的经验是：（一）建社过程也应是总结生产与发动农民生产的过程。黑龙江、吉林等省，在建社时大多采取了先总结互助组的生产，使农民认识组织起来的好处，和如何建立农业生产合作社进一步提高生产；新社建成后，即帮助他们做好冬季生产和全年的农副业生产计划，使合作社刚一成立就能投入生产。（二）建社过程应是教育社员及社外广大农民走社会主义道路的过程。各地试点建社的对象虽然都是较好的常年互助组，但骨干分子和一般农民、青年人和老年人、男人和妇女，在觉悟程度上仍不完全相同，因而入社动机也不一样；社外农民，对农业生产合作社的认识则又差一些，因此，各地都采取了大会、小会、家庭会等方式，对建社的农民和社外农民深入地进行了总路线和中共中央东北局制定的“农业生产合作社试行章程”的教育，并以当地原有的农业生产合作社的具体事例，说明建社的目的、前途和优越性以及建社必须遵守自愿的原则等，提高建社农民和社外农民的觉悟程度，澄清他们的各种疑虑，同时克服了孤立建社的偏向，使农业生产合作社一建立起来即和社外农民有了联系，便于扩大影响。（三）在建社过程中应深入细致地贯彻政策。各地建社中农民最关心的是生产资料（主要是车马）的处理和能否增加收入的问题，而有车马户和无车马户、地多户和地少户、劳动力强的户和劳动力弱的户，关心的问题又各不相同。因此，各地在处理这些问题时，都依据政策，发动社员进行民主讨论，分别具体情况作了恰当的处理。黑龙江省新建的七十二个农业生产合作社中，对车马的处理，大多根据社员的自愿，采取了租借形式，使入社的农民人人满意。吉林省新建立的农业生产合作社，根据各种条件，计算了可能的收入，妥善地确定收入分配办法，照顾到既有利于社内社会主义成分的增长和生产的发展，又照顾了全体社员都能获得合理的利益，使社员一开始即看到入社的好处，提高了劳动热情。（四）建社过程是训练和培养干部，提高区村干部领导能力的最好机会。各地在建社中一般都通过村里共产党支部进行工作，自始至终都吸收村支部的党员参加；新社建成后，并传授给村支部对社的领导方法。这样，县、区派来的建社干部离开后，村支部便能负责领导。吉林、辽东、黑龙江、辽西等省，都因此使新建的合作社，获得了村支部的及时领导。（五）通过建社带动互助组前进。不少地区，因在建社中即向农民明确交代办好互助组是建社的基础，使互助组的农民看到自己的发展前途，并有意识地帮助互助组解决存在的问题，因而互助组也更加巩固了。
    现在，东北各地正继续训练干部，传授建社经验，将在春耕前分批完成建社工作。
