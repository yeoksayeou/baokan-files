The various film studios under the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government completed the production of a large number of films in 1953. In order to meet the growing cultural needs of the broad masses of people, the planned production volume of films in 1954 has been appropriately increased compared to last year.

Ten feature films that were completed in 1953 include: "Dragon Beard Ditch," "When the Grapes are Ripe," "Harvest," "Gate No. 6," "Golden Silver Beach," "Taking Huashan Mountain by Strategy," "Chicken Feather Letter," "People of the Grassland," "Severing the Devil's Claws," and "The Butterfly Lovers," which began shooting in 1952. Five of these have already been released, and five will be released domestically soon.

Ten documentary films were completed in 1953: "The Great Land Reform," "Resist America, Aid Korea (Second Collection)," "Stalin Lives Forever in Our Hearts," "Folk Songs and Dances," "Southern Fujian Puppet Show," "Zhao Xiaolan," "Growing Up in Happiness," "Talking About Forests in the White Mountains and Black Waters," "Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble in China," and "Soviet Art Troupe in China"; in addition, sixteen short documentaries, fifty-two issues of "News Weekly," and twenty-four issues of "International News" were completed.

Ten science and education films were completed in 1953: "Painless Childbirth," "Sports and Health," "Li Xikui's Shunting Method," "Solar and Lunar Eclipses," "Soil and Water Conservation," "Eradicating Rice Pests - the Rice Stem Borer," "The Zoo," "Science and Technology (First Collection)," "Prevention and Treatment of Anthrax," and "Food and Nutrition."

In 1953, the film studios also dubbed forty feature films from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries into Mandarin.

The following thirteen feature films are planned for shooting in 1954: "Shajiadian," adapted from Liu Qing's original novel "Copper Walls and Iron Bastions," which depicts the heroic struggle of farmers in northern Shaanxi during the Liberation War; "Heroic Driver," which reflects the heroic spirit of the working class against the background of the full load, exceeding the axle, and the 500-kilometer movement; "Land," which demonstrates the vigorous land reform movement and its great victory; "Meng Changyou," which expresses the creativity of the working class in striving for industrial automation through the invention of the anti-circumferential disk by steel rolling workers; "Hassen and Jamila," which depicts young Kazakh men and women in Xinjiang striving for free love; "Three Years," which depicts the Five-Anti Campaign; "Reconnaissance Across the River," which depicts the heroic deeds of reconnaissance soldiers before the People's Liberation Army crossed the river; "The Mountain Village Comes Ringing," which depicts the unity of ethnic minorities on the Yunnan border in production, repelling the harassment of Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits and imperialist aggression; "Family on the Huai River," which reflects the life and struggle of the people in the Huai River area over the past fifteen years in conjunction with China's great Huai River control project; "Great Starting Point," which depicts how a worker becomes a leading cadre to reflect the advanced thinking of the working class; "Song Jingshi," which depicts the peasant revolutionary movement and its leading figures in the late Qing Dynasty; "People's Representative," adapted from Gu Yu's novel "A Proposal"; and "Menghe Storm," which depicts cadres working in a certain Tibetan area in southwestern China correctly implementing ethnic policies, uniting people from all walks of life, and suppressing bandits and special agents. The scripts for these films have already been sent to the film studios and are all in preparation for shooting.

In 1954, the film studios under the Film Bureau also plan to produce eleven stage documentaries of varying lengths, documenting the performance art of Peking opera and local operas by famous Chinese opera actors such as Mei Lanfang. In addition, the number of short documentaries planned for production in 1954 will increase to twenty-six, the number of science and education films will increase to fifteen, the number of Mandarin dubbed films from the Soviet Union and other countries will remain at forty, and the number of films dubbed in minority languages such as Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uyghur, as well as Cantonese, will be twenty. "News Weekly" guarantees one issue per week.

In 1953, the Film Bureau held meetings on film script creation, film art work, and issues related to documentary films, dubbed film production, and film production technology; and systematically studied socialist realism creation methods among film screenwriters, directors, actors, and other artistic cadres. After these meetings and studies, the ideological and professional levels of film cadres and their enthusiasm for creation have been improved, and film production has begun to be carried out in a more planned manner.
