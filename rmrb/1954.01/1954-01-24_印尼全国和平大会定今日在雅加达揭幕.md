Telegram of Congratulations from the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: The Secretariat of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, located in Beijing, sent a telegram on the 23rd to congratulate the Indonesian National Peace Conference scheduled to be held in Jakarta from January 24th to 29th. The telegram reads as follows: To the Indonesian National Peace Conference:

We extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Indonesian National Peace Conference.

Thanks to the continuous efforts of the people of China and Korea, and the people of all countries in the world in their movement to strive for peace, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. This is a great victory for the peace movement. However, warmongers continue to create international tension, obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, actively establish and expand military bases in various parts of Asia, and undermine normal economic and cultural exchanges between countries. Therefore, all of us who love peace must intensify our efforts to further ease international tensions and safeguard world peace.

We firmly believe that the convening of the Indonesian National Peace Conference will enable the Indonesian peace movement to achieve new and greater development.

We wish the conference a complete success. Secretariat of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee
