Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 25th: The Korean Central News Agency reports that the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea passed a decision on the 15th regarding guaranteeing the spring planting work for 1954.

The decision pointed out that the restoration of agriculture is of great significance for the balance of industry and agriculture, the improvement of people's lives after the war, the guarantee of the rapid recovery of the people's economy, and the strengthening of the worker-peasant alliance. In order to organize and mobilize all farmers to successfully complete the spring planting task under the slogan of "not wasting an inch of land," the decision stipulates: the restoration of arable land must be basically completed before spring plowing; irrigation facilities must be repaired and established, dry land must be improved into paddy fields, and the production of major crops must be increased; cash crops must be planted in large quantities, and vegetable planting must be expanded near cities and factory areas; poor farmers in areas with insufficient arable land and infertile land must be relocated to areas with surplus fertile land on a voluntary basis; the quality of seeds must be guaranteed, and the selection and disinfection of seeds must be thoroughly implemented; at the same time, a nationwide movement must be launched to increase crop yields, fertilize farmland, solve the problem of insufficient labor during the spring planting and transplanting season, and cultivate the spirit of mutual assistance among farmers; fixed production mutual aid groups must be organized, the economic foundation of various agricultural production cooperatives must be consolidated, and special attention must be paid to strengthening their work; assistance must be given to private orchards in their restoration.

The decision made measures for the timely supply of needed farm tools, water conservancy equipment, and animal power, pointed out the tasks of organizing and guiding farmers to carry out various sideline productions and participate in transportation work during the winter slack season; and called for the widespread development of a saving and thrift movement to ensure that farmers have sufficient farm tools, draft animals, grain, and production funds.

Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: According to a report in the Korean "Comrade's Newspaper," farmers in various parts of northern Korea are rapidly restoring the agricultural economy damaged by the war and are vigorously carrying out various preparations for agricultural production in 1954 to ensure a bumper harvest this year.

In order to restore and expand arable land, farmers in various places are actively engaged in water conservancy projects. For example, farmers in Xinchang Village, Changdao County, Jiangyuan Province, near the armistice line, changed the direction of the small river flowing through the center of the village, turning 2,000 pings of reed fields completely into rice paddies. Farmers in Chengshan Village, Changdao County, are filling in bomb craters, and have filled in more than 40 bomb craters, restoring more than 500 pings of farmland.

In the work of repairing farm tools, Korean farmers have demonstrated a spirit of overcoming difficulties. Farmers in Yunlong Village, Jiangxi County, Ping An Nan Province, have set up their own blacksmith shops to repair farm tools, and have repaired five sets each of cyclone machines and threshing machines that were damaged during the war.

Korean farmers have been stepping up their efforts to prepare high-quality seeds and accumulate fertilizer. Farmers in Yunxing Village, Dechuan County, Ping An Nan Province, have displayed a fine style of mutual assistance in these tasks. All the farmers in the village have prepared the seeds needed for this year and have carried out a large amount of composting work.

At the same time, farmers in various places are exchanging experiences and promoting advanced agricultural production methods. Some rural areas in Jiangyuan Province, Huanghai Province, and Hamgyong Buk Province have held experience exchange meetings and symposiums for this purpose.

    朝鲜内阁通过保障春季播种工作的决定
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁在十五日通过了关于保障一九五四年春季播种工作的决定。
    决定中指出，农业的恢复对于工农业的平衡、战后人民生活的提高、保障人民经济的迅速恢复和工农联盟的加强，都具有很重要的意义。为了在“不荒废一寸土地”的口号下组织动员全体农民胜利完成春季播种的任务，决定中规定：春耕以前基本上要完成耕地的恢复工作；要修复和建立灌溉设施，把旱地改良为水田，增产主要的农作物；要大量种植经济作物，在城市附近及工厂地带扩大蔬菜的种植；要在自愿的原则下，把耕地不足、土地贫瘠地区的贫农迁往有多余良田的地区；要保证种籽优良，彻底实施种籽的选择和消毒工作；同时要展开全民性的运动，提高农作物的收获量，肥沃农田，解决春季播种移秧时期劳动力不足的问题，培养农民的互助精神；要组织固定的生产互助组，巩固各种农业生产合作社的经济基础，对加强它们的工作予以特别的关心；要协助私营果树园进行恢复。
    决定中作出了关于及时供应所需农具、水利器材和畜力的措施，指出了组织、指导农民在冬季农闲时期进行各种副业生产和参加搬运工作等的任务；并号召广泛地开展节约储蓄运动，保证农民具有足够的农具、耕畜、粮食和生产资金。
   【新华社二十五日讯】据朝鲜“战友报”报道：朝鲜北部各地农民正在迅速恢复遭受战争破坏的农业经济，大力进行一九五四年的农业生产的各种准备工作，以保证今年的丰收。
    各地农民为了恢复和扩大耕地，正积极进行兴修水利等工作。例如，靠近停战线的江原道昌道郡新昌里的农民，改变了流经村庄中心的小河的方向，使两千坪芦田完全变为稻田。昌道郡城山里农民正在进行填平弹坑的工作，现已填平四十几个弹坑，恢复了五百余坪田地。
    在修理农具的工作中，朝鲜农民显示了克服困难的精神。平安南道江西郡云龙里的农民自己开设铁匠炉来修理农具，现已修完在战时遭受破坏的旋风机和打谷机各五台。
    朝鲜农民已在加紧进行准备优良种籽和积肥工作。平安南道德川郡云兴里的农民在这些工作中，发挥了互助的优良作风。全里农民都已准备好今年需用的种籽，并且进行了大量堆肥工作。
    同时，各地农民又互相交流经验，推广先进的农业生产法。江原道、黄海道、咸镜北道等地的一些农村都为此举行了经验交流会和座谈会等。
