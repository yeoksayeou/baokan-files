Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 21st: The Polish delegation today released a statement by the Polish Commissioner of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at the commission's January 19th meeting, strongly protesting the Indian chairman's decision to return prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation to their original detaining side.

The statement pointed out: "The Polish delegation, in principle, agrees with the premises and motives mentioned by the chairman in this letter. Because these motives are correct, it is all the more regrettable that the Indian delegation considers it possible and necessary to draw conclusions that not only contradict its position but also constitute an extremely serious and completely unalterable violation of the 'Terms of Reference' on which the commission's work is based, and to take such measures. The Indian delegation has decided to take responsibility itself for returning the POWs as POWs to the original detaining side."

The statement said that it seems incorrect to say, as the chairman said in his letter to the United Nations Command on January 14th, that "due to the lack of agreement between the parties concerned," therefore "the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot... continue... to perform any duties to promote the implementation of the 'Terms of Reference'." The fact is that when "the so-called United Nations Command refused the solution proposed by the chairman of the committee," "the majority of the commissioners on the committee tried to circumvent the kind of responsibility stipulated in Article 24 of the 'Terms of Reference' and did not make a decision on the committee's future work." The statement cited the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission chairman's letter to the United Nations Command on January 14th, saying, "The firm position of the United Nations Command... undoubtedly illustrates that the United Nations Command cannot agree to establish those conditions and methods that are of fundamental significance to the further implementation of the 'Terms of Reference,' and without these conditions and methods, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot seek further implementation of the 'Terms of Reference'." The Polish commissioner's statement emphasized, "This point should be most emphatically pointed out, because it once again clearly illustrates who should bear the primary responsibility for obstructing the implementation of the armistice agreement regarding the prisoner of war issue."

The statement continued: "Furthermore, the so-called United Nations Command illegally and groundlessly insisted that the Indian Custodial Forces' custody of the POWs should end on January 23, 1954, that the POWs should regain civilian status, and suggested returning the POWs to the former detaining side. The chairman of the committee was right when he talked about this in his letter of January 14: no changes can be made to the status of the POWs before the procedures stipulated in the 'Terms of Reference' are implemented, that is, before the explanatory work is actually completed and the political conference has considered the handling of the POWs. He also said that 'any unilateral action by any of the parties concerned would not be in accordance with the "Terms of Reference."'"

The Polish commissioner's statement pointed out that the Indian chairman's decision to return the POWs to the former detaining side on his own responsibility is "unacceptable" for the following reasons:

"1. From a purely legal point of view—because it makes it impossible for the committee to fulfill the important responsibilities it has undertaken under the 'Terms of Reference,' it seriously violates the 'Terms of Reference.' The 'Terms of Reference' specifically stipulates that the POWs should be completely removed from the control of the former detaining side, and its wording is also intended to ensure that these POWs never return to such control.

"2. From a political and legal point of view—because by returning the POWs to the former detaining side, it nullifies even the meager achievements the committee has made so far. Therefore, it is in fact a step backwards in resolving the POW issue under the armistice agreement, makes this agreement fail to be implemented in a very important aspect, and thus exacerbates the Korean situation.

"3. From a humanitarian point of view—because, as far as the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side are concerned, the horrors and persecution they once suffered in the notorious POW camps on Geoje Island and Jeju Island are now waiting for them again, and as reported by American news agencies, camps have already been specially built for them in South Korea."

The statement concluded, "The facts I have mentioned and the arguments I have presented irrefutably demonstrate that it is one of the warring parties in Korea, primarily the so-called United Nations Command, that has caused the committee to encounter its current critical situation. It has done so by operating through the evil special agent organizations it has established in the southern camps, controlling the southern camps, obstructing explanatory work for the POWs, using force and intimidation to prevent them from being repatriated, and finally directly and categorically rejecting the solutions to the POW issue proposed by the committee in accordance with the agreement signed by the command.

"Therefore, it must be emphatically stated that all the consequences arising from the fact that the so-called United Nations Command has obstructed the work of the committee, making it impossible for it to complete its mission, as well as this serious violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, should be borne entirely by the so-called United Nations Command."

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 21st: The Czechoslovak delegation today released the statement of the Czechoslovak commissioner of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at the commission meeting on January 19th. The statement expressed strong opposition and serious protest against the Indian chairman's planned measures to return prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation to their original detaining side. The Czechoslovak commissioner said, "I believe that this is not only an illegal action, but also a threat to the Korean armistice, a major step backwards in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue."

The statement pointed out: "The measures planned by the chairman of the commission are tantamount to dealing with the POWs without fulfilling the preconditions stipulated in the 'Terms of Reference'—a method of dealing with them that the Indian delegation itself and the chairman of the commission admitted in the letter of January 14, 1954, as being impermissible and destructive to the 'Terms of Reference.' We also believe that this is a very serious and incorrect way to decide the fate of the POWs. The fact remains unchanged even though the chairman of the commission says grandiosely in his letter: 'I am not doing this to make any changes to their identity or to carry out the final handling of the POWs.'"

"The chairman of the committee and the Indian delegation must be very clear—as is world opinion—about what consequences the planned measures will entail. No one has any doubts about the preparations that the United Nations Command, together with the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek groups, have already made in full view of world public opinion. Referring to the public statements of responsible American politicians and military commanders, as well as General Hull's reply to the chairman of the committee, everyone can clearly see that the United Nations Command is about to implement the final stage of a long-planned conspiracy—the forced detention of POWs. The measures planned by the chairman of the committee provide the United Nations Command with a convenient opportunity to realize this conspiracy."

The Czechoslovak commissioner said that in addition to the statement recently issued to the press, the Czechoslovak delegation would like to say a few words: "The Czechoslovak delegation generally agrees with the basic arguments included in the statement of the chairman of the commission on January 12, 1954, and the statement to both sides on January 14, 1954, as well as the interpretation of the 'Terms of Reference'." However, "the Indian delegation did not draw the correct conclusions from these basically correct arguments and interpretations. The conclusions it reached are not only incorrect, but also seriously violate the 'Terms of Reference'." The Czechoslovak delegation "disagrees, and can never agree, with these conclusions, and reiterates its strongest protest against them."

The statement said: "We fully agree with the Indian delegation that the basic purpose and main goal of the 'Terms of Reference' is—to quote the provisions of Article 1—'to ensure that all POWs... have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated'." The statement continued: "The measures that the chairman of the committee intends to take, that is, to return the POWs to the custody of the original detaining side, not only violate the main goal and basic purpose of the 'Terms of Reference,' but also make it impossible to achieve them forever."

The statement pointed out: "The purpose of Article 4 of the 'Terms of Reference' is to 'release the POWs forever from the power of the detaining side, so as to permanently end the detaining side's control over the POWs, whether direct or indirect.' The 'Terms of Reference' does not allow, and explicitly excludes, any measures to return the POWs to the control and custody of the original detaining side."

"However, the measures that the chairman of the committee intends to take are precisely to cancel this basic provision, to cancel the agreement reached by the two sides on the repatriation of POWs as contained in the armistice agreement and the 'Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission'."

The statement emphasized: "If we still remember the violence, terror and inhumane atrocities symbolized by names such as Geoje Island and Jeju Island, and if we consider the future fate of the POWs, we cannot but believe that the planned measures are a serious violation of the 'Terms of Reference' and the armistice agreement, and we have to believe that these measures are inhumane and immoral."

The Czechoslovak commissioner continued: "It is clear that it is not permissible from a legal point of view to handle POWs in any way other than in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the 'Terms of Reference.' We can also say that it is not permissible from a political and moral point of view. Even the chairman of the committee's letter of January 14, 1954, admits this."

The statement concluded: "The parties concerned entrusted the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to implement the 'Terms of Reference' and granted it appropriate powers, even the use of force if necessary. The responsibilities entrusted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission by both sides require it to conduct explanatory work within the entire prescribed 90-day period, and to submit the issue to a political conference for discussion before taking any measures regarding the POWs. It is the unique power of the commission to make decisions on this issue and to take measures. In order for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to complete its important task in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it must make these decisions and take resolute and decisive measures."

### 中立国遣返委员会波、捷委员发表声明  抗议印军把战俘交还原拘留方

    中立国遣返委员会波、捷委员发表声明
    抗议印军把战俘交还原拘留方
    【新华社开城二十一日电】波兰代表团今天公布了中立国遣返委员会波兰委员在委员会一月十九日会议上发表的一个声明，强烈抗议印度主席把未行使遣返权利的战俘交还原拘留方的决定。
    声明指出：“波兰代表团在原则上同意主席这次信中所说的前提与动机。由于这种动机是正确的，因而更加令人遗憾的是：印度代表团认为可能而且有必要得出不仅与它的立场不符而且构成了极端严重的、完全无可改变的违反委员会工作所引以为据的‘职权范围’的行为的结论，并采取这种措施。印度代表团已决定由它自己负责把战俘以战俘身份交还给原拘留方。”
    声明说，如果像主席在他一月十四日致联合国军司令部的信中所说的那样说，“由于有关双方之间没有协议”，因此“中立国遣返委员会不能……继续……执行任何职务以促进‘职权范围’的实施”，这似乎是不正确的。事实是，在“所谓联合国军方面拒绝了委员会主席提出的解决办法”时，“委员会中的大多数委员试图规避‘职权范围’第二十四款所规定的那种责任，没有对委员会以后的工作作出决定。”声明援引中立国遣返委员会主席在一月十四日致联合国军司令部的信说，“联合国军司令部的坚决立场……无可置疑地说明了联合国军司令部不能同意建立那些对进一步实施‘职权范围’的办法与目的有基本意义的条件与办法，而没有这些条件与办法，中立国遣返委员会是不能寻求进一步实施‘职权范围’的办法与目的的。”波兰委员的声明强调说，“这一点应该予以最着重地指出，因为它再一次明确地说明了谁应对阻挠停战协定关于战俘问题部分的实施担负主要责任。”
    声明接着说：“此外，所谓联合国军司令部非法地并毫无根据地坚持印度看管部队对战俘的看管须在一九五四年一月二十三日终止，战俘须恢复平民身份，并建议将战俘交还前拘留方。委员会主席在他一月十四日的信中谈到这一点时说得很对：在‘职权范围’中所规定的程序实施以前，即在解释工作实际完成和政治会议考虑了战俘的处理问题以前，不能对战俘的身份作任何改变。他又说，‘任何有关方面的任何片面行动将不符合于“职权范围”。’”
    波兰委员的声明指出，印度主席由自己负责决定把战俘交还前拘留方一举是“不能允许的”，理由如下：
    “一、从纯法律的观点来看——因为它使得委员会无法履行它根据‘职权范围’所承担的重要职责，因而它严重违反了‘职权范围’。‘职权范围’特别规定，战俘应完全脱离前拘留方的控制，而且它的措词也是要使这些战俘永不再回到这样的控制之下。
    “二、从政治和法律的观点来看——因为把战俘交还前拘留方，它就甚至使得委员会迄今为止所获得的那点微不足道的成就也化为乌有，因此，它事实上是在根据停战协定解决战俘问题方面倒退一步，使得这个协定在一个很重要的方面未能实施，从而使朝鲜局势严重化。
    “三、从人道的观点来看——因为就朝中被俘人员来说，他们在巨济岛和济州岛上臭名远扬的战俘营中曾经受到的恐怖和迫害，现在又在等着他们，正如美国的通讯社所报道，在南朝鲜已经特地为他们造好了营地。”
    声明最后说，“我所谈到的事实和举出的论据都无可辩驳地表明，是在朝鲜的交战双方的一方，主要的是所谓联合国军司令部，使委员会遭遇到目前危急状态，它通过它在南营中所建立的罪恶的特务组织进行活动，控制南营，阻挠对战俘的解释工作，使用武力和恐怖手段阻止他们遣返，最后断然直接拒绝了委员会按照该司令部签过字的协议而提出的关于战俘问题的解决办法。
    “因此必须着重声明，由于所谓联合国军方面阻碍了委员会的工作，使其无法完成其任务，从而引起的一切后果，以及这种严重违反朝鲜停战协定的行为，都应由所谓联合国军方面负完全责任。”
    【新华社开城二十一日电】捷克斯洛伐克代表团今天公布了中立国遣返委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员一月十九日在委员会会议上的声明，声明表示坚决反对并严重抗议印度主席打算把未行使遣返权利的战俘交还给原拘留方的措施。捷克斯洛伐克委员说，“我认为，这不仅是一个非法的行动，而且是对朝鲜停战的威胁，这是在和平解决朝鲜问题方面后退了一大步。”
    声明指出：“委员会主席策划中的措施无异于不履行‘职权范围’所规定的先决条件就处理战俘——这种处理办法就是印度代表团自己以及委员会主席在一九五四年一月十四日的信里也承认是不能容许的而且是破坏‘职权范围’的。我们还认为，这是一个非常严重的、错误的决定战俘命运的处理办法。尽管委员会主席在他的信里冠冕堂皇地说：
  ‘我这么做并不是要使他们的身份有任何改变，或者要进行对战俘的最后处理。’也并不能改变这个事实。
    “委员会主席与印度代表团必然知道得很清楚——世界舆论也一样——计划采取的措施意味着什么后果。对于联合国军司令部伙同李承晚与蒋介石集团目前在世界公众众目睽睽之下已经作了的准备工作，没有人再有任何怀疑。参照美国负责的政界人士与军事司令官的公开言论以及赫尔将军对委员会主席的复信，每个人都可以十分明显地看出联合国军司令部就要把蓄意已久的阴谋的最后阶段——强迫扣留战俘——付诸实现了。委员会主席策划中的措施为联合国军司令部提供了实现这个阴谋的便利机会。”
    捷克斯洛伐克委员说，捷克斯洛伐克代表团除了最近向报界发表的声明外，还愿意说几句话：“捷克斯洛伐克代表团大体同意委员会主席在一九五四年一月十二日的声明以及一九五四年一月十四日致双方的声明中包括的基本论点以及对‘职权范围’的解释”。但是，“印度代表团没有从这些基本上正确的论点和解释中得出正确的结论，它所得出的结论不仅是不正确的，而且严重违反了‘职权范围’”。捷克斯洛伐克代表团“不同意，并且永远不能同意这些结论，而且对它们再度表示最坚决的抗议”。
    声明说：“我们完全同意印度代表团的意见，‘职权范围’的基本目的和主要目标是——引用第一款的条文——‘保证全部战俘……有机会行使其被遣返的权利’。”声明接着说：“委员会主席打算采取的措施，即把战俘交还原拘留方看管，不仅违反‘职权范围’的主要目标和基本目的，而且也使得它们永远无法实现。”
    声明指出：“职权范围”第四款的目的是“把战俘从拘留一方的权力下永远释放出来，以便永远结束拘留一方对战俘的、无论是直接的还是间接的控制。‘职权范围’没有允许、并明确排斥把战俘交还原拘留方控制与看管的任何措施”。
    “但是，委员会主席打算采取的措施正是为了取消这一基本规定，为了取消停战协定和‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’中所载的双方就遣俘问题达成的协议。”
    声明强调说：“如果我们还记得巨济岛、济州岛这类名字所象征的暴力、恐怖和违反人道的暴行，如果我们考虑到战俘今后的命运，我们就不能不认为策划中的措施是严重违反‘职权范围’和停战协定的，不得不认为这些措施是违反人道的和不道德的。”
    捷克斯洛伐克委员继续说：“事情很明白，如果不依照‘职权范围’所规定的程序，而用其他办法处理战俘，那从法律上来说，是不能允许的，我们还可以说就是从政治上和道义上来说，也都是不能允许的。就是委员会主席一九五四年一月十四日的信件也承认这一点。”
    该声明最后说：“有关各方委托中立国遣返委员会执行‘职权范围’，并授予适当的权力，必要时甚至可以使用武力。双方委托中立国遣返委员会的责任需要它在规定的整个九十天时期之内进行解释工作，并在对战俘采取任何处理措施之前，把问题提交政治会议讨论。对这问题作出决定和采取措施是委员会特有的权力。为了使中立国遣返委员会能在朝鲜问题的和平解决中完成它的重要任务，它必须作出这些决定，并坚决和果断地采取措施。”
