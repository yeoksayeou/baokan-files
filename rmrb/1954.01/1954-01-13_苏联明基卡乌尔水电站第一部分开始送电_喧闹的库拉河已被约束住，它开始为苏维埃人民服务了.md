    Xinhua News Agency, Mingachevir, 12th: According to a TASS report from Mingachevir, the dedication ceremony for the completion and power generation of the first section of the Mingachevir Hydroelectric Station in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was held on the 10th at the hydroelectric station's location. Attendees included Baku oil workers, cotton planters, livestock breeders, and grape growers from various districts near the hydroelectric station, as well as representatives from the Communist Party, the government, cultural circles, and the builders of the hydroelectric station.
    I. Zade, the construction site director of the Mingachevir Hydroelectric Station, spoke at the meeting, officially announcing the completion of the first section of the hydroelectric station.
    Kuliyev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Republic, conveyed congratulations to the builders on behalf of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party, the Council of Ministers of the Republic, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Speakers at the meeting expressed their love and gratitude for the Communist Party and the Soviet government, which consistently care about the economic and cultural development of Azerbaijan.
    After the meeting, Yakubov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party, cut the ribbon, and the first two powerful turbines of the hydroelectric station began generating electricity. The current can be transmitted through high-voltage power lines to Baku, Kirovabad, and neighboring areas.
    Note: The Mingachevir Hydroelectric Station is one of the Soviet Union's giant hydroelectric stations, built on the Kura River near the Boz-Dag Mountains in the Caucasus. When the hydroelectric station is fully operational, its annual power generation will reach 1.5 billion kilowatt-hours, which will nearly double Azerbaijan's electricity and further boost the republic's industrial production. It will also provide electricity to collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations in nearby areas. The hydroelectric station project also includes the "Mingachevir Sea," one of the largest reservoirs in Europe. The reservoir is 25 kilometers wide and 75 kilometers long, with a water capacity of 16 billion cubic meters. After the completion of the reservoir project, the water it contains will not only drive the powerful turbines of the hydroelectric station but will also irrigate the arid grasslands of Karabakh, Shirvan, and Mugan through a network of irrigation canals, turning hundreds of thousands of hectares of land into fertile land.
    Xinhua News Agency, Mingachevir, 12th: According to a TASS report from Mingachevir, I. Zade, the construction site director of the Mingachevir Hydroelectric Station, made a statement to TASS reporters on the 10th regarding the start of power transmission from the first section of the hydroelectric station: Today, we feel the joy of a great victory. The noisy Kura River has been restrained and will serve the Soviet people. High-voltage power lines have transmitted the first current to the Baku oilfields and other industrial centers of the republic, as well as to collective farms.
    The main concrete pouring work on the construction site has been completed. The power plant and other equipment are ready for use. The new city of Mingachevir has been built on both banks of the Kura River.
    The largest piece of equipment on the construction site, a huge dam, blocks the river water of the Kura River. This dam is nearly 65 meters high. After the project is completed, it will be more than 1,500 meters long, 500 meters wide, and 87.5 meters high. Currently, 11.5 million cubic meters of gravel and sand have been piled up on the dam, and its volume is constantly increasing. Powerful dredging machines deposit 20,000 cubic meters of soil onto the dam every day.
    The hydroelectric station's reservoir, the "Mingachevir Sea," will hold 16 billion cubic meters of water. Today, this "sea" is already 65 kilometers long, with a depth of 56 meters at the dam. In 1954, it will expand to 75 kilometers long and 13 kilometers wide. The "Mingachevir Sea" will supply water to four irrigation canals, which will make the centuries-old dream of Azerbaijani farmers a reality. The water from the "sea" will turn the dry, salt-covered Kura-Araks lowland into fertile land, where wheat, cotton, peach trees, and pomegranate trees will be planted on hundreds of thousands of hectares of land. This year, one of the four irrigation canals—Upper Karabakh—will receive water from a tunnel through the mountains. Due to irrigation, the cotton yield in the area may nearly double. The water of the Kura River will transform the barren grasslands of Shirvan and Mugan into fertile fields, orchards, vineyards, and prosperous pastures.
    Factories all over the Soviet Union are supplying equipment to the Mingachevir Hydroelectric Station construction site. Leningrad supplies turbine generators and lifting equipment, Moscow sends powerful transformers, Ukraine sends electrical equipment and steel cables, and the Urals send self-propelled excavators. Workers from twenty ethnic groups come here to work from all over the country.
    After the first section of the hydroelectric station begins generating electricity, work will continue on the construction site. By the end of this year, all six turbine generators will begin generating electricity. Workers are striving to complete the project one year ahead of schedule.

    苏联明基卡乌尔水电站第一部分开始送电
    喧闹的库拉河已被约束住，它开始为苏维埃人民服务了
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社明基卡乌尔讯：苏联阿塞拜疆共和国的明基卡乌尔水电站第一部分落成发电典礼，于十日在水电站所在地举行。参加典礼的有：巴库的石油工人，水电站附近各区的植棉者、牲畜饲养者和葡萄种植者，共产党、政府和文化界代表及水电站的建筑者。
    明基卡乌尔水电站工地主任伊·扎杰在会上致词，正式宣布水电站第一部分竣工。
    阿塞拜疆共和国部长会议主席库利耶夫代表阿塞拜疆共产党中央委员会、共和国部长会议和最高苏维埃主席团向建筑者们致贺。在会上发言的人表示了他们对于经常关心阿塞拜疆经济和文化发展的共产党和苏维埃政府的热爱和感谢。
    会后，阿塞拜疆共产党中央委员会第一书记雅库波夫剪彩，水电站头两个效力强大的透平就开始发电，电流通过高压电线可输送到巴库、基洛夫巴德和邻近各区。
    按：明基卡乌尔水电站是苏联巨型水电站之一，建立在高加索山脉的波兹—达格山附近的库拉河上。水电站全部投入生产后，发电量每年将达十五亿瓩时，这将使阿塞拜疆的电力增加将近一倍，使该共和国的工业生产进一步高涨，并使附近地区的集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站得到电力供应。水电站工程还包括欧洲最大的水库之一“明基卡乌尔海”。水库宽二十五公里，长七十五公里，容水一百六十亿公方。水库工程完成以后，它所容纳的水除推动水电站的强力透平外，还将经过纵横分布的灌溉渠，灌溉卡拉巴哈斯克、希尔凡斯克、穆干斯克等干旱的草原，使几十万公顷的土地变成肥沃的土地。
   【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社明基卡乌尔讯：明基卡乌尔水电站工地主任伊·扎杰，十日就水电站第一部分开始送电一事对塔斯社记者发表谈话说：今天，我们感到了巨大的胜利的喜悦。喧闹的库拉河已经被约束住，并且将为苏维埃人民服务了。高压电线已把第一股电流输送到巴库石油田和共和国的其他工业中心以及集体农庄。
    工地上的主要的混凝土浇灌工作已经完成。电力厂和其他设备已经准备使用。明基卡乌尔新城已在库拉河两岸建筑起来。
    工地的最大的设备，一座巨大的拦河坝挡住了库拉河的河水。这座堤坝已有近六十五公尺高。在工程完竣后，它将有一千五百多公尺长，五百公尺宽，八十七点五公尺高。现在堤坝上已堆砌了一千一百五十万公方的小石和沙子，它的体积还在不断地增加。效力强大的汲泥机每天把二万公方泥土堆到堤坝上去。
    水电站的水库“明基卡乌尔海”将容纳一百六十亿公方的水。今天，这个“海”已有六十五公里长，堤坝处的深度已有五十六公尺。在一九五四年，它将扩展到长达七十五公里、宽达十三公里。“明基卡乌尔海”将供水给四条灌溉渠，这将使阿塞拜疆农民几百年来的梦想实现。“海”中的水将使干燥的、覆着盐的库拉—阿拉克斯低地变成肥沃的土地，几十万公顷土地上将栽种小麦、棉花、桃树和石榴树。今年，四条灌溉渠之一——上卡拉巴哈斯克将从穿山而过的一条隧道中得到水。由于得到灌溉，该地区的棉产量可能增加近一倍。库拉河的水将使希尔凡斯克、穆干斯克等荒芜的草原变成肥沃的田地、果园、葡萄园和富饶的牧场。
    全苏联的工厂都在以设备供应明基卡乌尔水电站工地。列宁格勒供应透平发电机和举重设备，莫斯科送来效力强大的变压器，乌克兰送来电气设备和钢索，乌拉尔送来自动移动挖掘机。从全国各地到这里来工作的有二十个民族的工人。
    在水电站的第一部分开始发电以后，工地上还将继续工作。到今年年底以前，所有六个透平发电机都将开始发电。工作者正在努力使这个工程提前一年完工。
