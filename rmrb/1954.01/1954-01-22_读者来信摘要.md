Reader's Letters Summary

    Strengthening the Management of Drug Dealers and Peddlers
     -- A Summary of Readers' Letters

    Recently, it has been discovered in many rural areas and small towns that itinerant drug peddlers are selling substandard medicines, defrauding people of money, and seriously affecting the people's health. Zhang Gui, a teacher at Shimen Elementary School in Shanglin County, Guangxi, wrote: In Guangxi, itinerant drug peddlers are almost everywhere, and many of them are charlatans. A teacher bought eye drops from a drug peddler and used them, only to have his eyes become red and swollen. Some drug peddlers sell cod liver oil made with maltose and a very small amount of cod liver oil, priced as high as 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per bottle. Some drug peddlers advertise medicines like Qingliang Dan (Cooling Pills), Tuiresan (Fever Reducing Powder), Dutong Wan (Stomachache Pills), and Xuezhongbao (Blood Treasure) as being able to cure all diseases, which has caused no small amount of harm. Zhang Shichun of the Jiading County Health Center in Jiangsu Province wrote: In our county, there are often drug peddlers peddling medicines on the streets. Once, a farmer bought several packets of "wound medicine" and found many small worms inside. The peddler retorted that the worms in the wound medicine were "good stuff," reasoning that "some wound worms are cured as soon as they are eaten." In Chenliu County, Henan, it was discovered that some vendors selling eye medicine carried with them porcelain bowls for making medicine, empty eye drop bottles, and raw materials such as boric acid and menthol, and would randomly mix the medicine when someone bought it, without any standards. In Jiading County, Jiangsu, a drug peddler bought 54,000 yuan worth of wound medicine from a Chinese medicine shop, repackaged it into more than 300 small packets, and sold each packet for 1,500 yuan, making a profit as high as nine times the cost. Readers from other provinces such as Guangdong, Jiangxi, Shanxi, and Jilin have also written to reflect similar situations.

    More seriously, some drug peddlers impersonate doctors, treating people indiscriminately and defrauding them of consultation fees. The Health Section of Huangpi County, Hubei, reported: In our county, we often find drug peddlers from Huangchuan and Xinyang in Henan Province carrying stethoscopes to see patients. One drug peddler defrauded more than 1 million yuan in consultation fees in one day in a village in the Third District; a patient with chronic rheumatoid arthritis was defrauded of 100,000 yuan in consultation fees at once. In rural areas near Baoding, there have also been cases of drug peddlers using corrosive medicines on women's vaginas when treating them, resulting in erosion of the cervix and healed scars on the vaginal walls, affecting the normal discharge of menstruation.

    In addition, some cigarette shops, tea shops, and grocery stores in various places also sell various medicines; some Chinese medicine shops also sell Western medicines on consignment, and Western pharmacies also sell Chinese medicines on consignment. Some consignment stores do not know the uses, dosages, and contraindications of the medicines they sell, resulting in indiscriminate sales. For example, Fan Jun'an, a reader from Chongqing County, Sichuan, reported: Chinese medicine shops in the county generally sell Western medicines such as sulfathiazole, sulfadiazine, santonin, and ephedrine on consignment. Some consignment stores refer to all kinds of sulfa drugs as "anti-inflammatory tablets," mistakenly believing that they can cure all diseases. A Chinese medicine shop in Yanji County, Jilin, sold ephedrine and told a patient to take a whole bottle at once, almost causing a fatality.

    One of the reasons for the above chaotic situation is that the health authorities and industrial and commercial administrative departments in some areas lack the necessary education and management of drug dealers and peddlers, and some even issue various certificates to illegal drug peddlers without authorization. For example, in Huangpi County, Hubei, it was discovered that drug peddlers impersonating doctors held mobile business licenses issued by the people's governments of Huangchuan and Xinyang counties in Henan. Jiading County, Jiangsu, even discovered that some drug peddlers held certificates issued by the local government, cultural center, or police station. Although some cadres of health authorities and industrial and commercial administrative departments know the seriousness of this situation, they believe that drug peddlers have been circulating in society for a long time, have too much mobility, and are difficult to manage, so they adopt a laissez-faire attitude. This is obviously not a responsible attitude towards the people.

    In order to effectively manage the pharmaceutical market and ban the illegal activities of drug peddlers, readers have put forward the following suggestions: 1. All those engaged in the pharmaceutical industry, especially itinerant merchants, should provide detailed information on their business address and scope of distribution (such as drug names, indications, specifications, quantities, place of origin, etc.), and have qualified practitioners, and report to the local health department and industrial and commercial administrative department for review, and can only operate after approval. 2. In order to facilitate management, measures should be taken to restrict the business locations of pharmaceutical merchants; pharmaceutical merchants shall not operate medicines beyond the approved proprietary Chinese medicines, prepared prescriptions, and herbs of the local government, and drug peddlers are strictly prohibited from making and selling their own products. 3. Those drug dealers who swindle and deceive, especially drug peddlers who impersonate doctors, must be resolutely banned.

    Appropriately Organize Construction Technicians
    To Participate in Design Work During Winter Shutdown
    Hong Zhongliang, Liu Jiaqi, and Yuan Changren from the directly affiliated construction site of the Industrial Construction Company of the Central Construction Engineering Department wrote: Many construction units in Northeast and North China generally have to stop construction in winter, and construction department technicians have nothing to do. To avoid waste of manpower, it is recommended that construction department technicians suitable for design work be temporarily transferred to the design department during the winter break. There are two advantages to doing this:
  1. Design departments are very busy in winter preparing for the design of various projects for the coming year. Transferring technicians from the construction department to assist in this work can enhance the design strength. At the same time, it can enable a group of technical cadres to have work to do in winter. 2. It can strengthen the connection between the design department and the construction department and avoid certain disconnects. Because the staff of the construction unit are the most likely to discover certain design flaws. The staff of the construction unit can bring these personal feelings to the design department during the cold winter, which can make the drawings designed later more perfect.
    We hope that relevant departments will carefully and prudently consider our opinion.
    Editor's Note: The opinions of readers Hong Zhongliang, etc. are basically correct. After we contacted the General Office of the Central Construction Engineering Department, they believed that: it is beneficial to organize construction personnel to participate in design work in winter before the winter construction problem is well resolved. However, at present, the national plan has not been fully issued, and the general design department does not have much work in winter, so it is not possible to organize a large number of construction personnel to participate in design work. Various places can organize some construction personnel to participate in design work (especially standard design) according to the specific situation, and the construction department should specifically contact the design department in advance.

    Offices with Heating Equipment
    Also Have Stoves
    Readers Wu Cheng and Qi Peisen wrote: In the offices of a brand-new building on Xihuangchenggen Street in Beijing, heating has been installed, but there are also stoves. People often look at this strange thing with a doubtful expression.
    This building was built by the North China Basic Construction Engineering Company in 1952. After its completion, the North China Mass Organizations Administrative Affairs Management Office was responsible for managing the building. For more than a year, it has been racking its brains over the heating problem. The original design of the building lacked heating equipment, and it was only decided to add heating after the building was built. As a result, walls were broken and floors were pierced, and the heating was finally installed. However, it is said that there are too few radiators, so the heating is not warm. When it is cold, the staff have to wear gloves to work. Therefore, it was decided to spend another 26 million yuan to increase the radiators. However, the temperature in the office did not increase with the increase in radiators. It is said that the fundamental reason is the heating route. Therefore, another 15 million yuan was added to the budget to repair the heating route. However, it is said that the engineers do not know where the problem lies. Soon, winter arrived, followed by a cold wave. The management agency of this building had to take "emergency measures" and light stoves in the heated rooms.
    The fact that there are stoves in heated rooms tells us that even basic construction projects that are not as complicated as installing heating will definitely run into snags if they lack careful planning and a serious attitude.

    One Should Not Treat
    People's Letters with a Perfunctory Attitude
    Reader Guo Zhensheng wrote: I work at the afforestation station in Changwu Town, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province. When I went to the Agriculture and Forestry Section of the county last November 5, Wang Fazheng, a comrade in the Agriculture and Forestry Section, gave me a letter from the masses criticizing the Changwu Town afforestation station for causing waste due to unplanned afforestation, and asked me to write a reply immediately. I explained to him: I was still working in the village when the Changwu Town afforestation station planted seedlings, and I didn't know the situation at the time. But he said: "Just make a review based on the materials revealed in the letter from the masses." Under his urging, I randomly "made up" a review and handed it to him. Afterwards, I studied the specific situation of afforestation and seedling planting with the mayor of Changwu Town and found that my review was completely wrong. I went to Wang Fazheng and explained this situation and pointed out: "We do not check and improve our work according to the letters from the masses, but treat the opinions of the masses with a perfunctory attitude, which is incorrect." But he said: "Just reply, it's all mailed!" The matter ended like this. After many days of consideration, I realized that this kind of deceiving the masses is a very bad practice. I believe that the Zhaodong County People's Government should educate Comrade Wang Fazheng to correct his understanding of the work of handling people's letters and re-handle this people's letter criticizing the work of the Changwu Town afforestation station.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    加强对药商、药贩的管理
     ——读者来信综述
    近来有不少农村和中小城镇都发现行商药贩经销不合规格的药品，骗取钱财，并严重影响了人民的身体健康。广西上林县石门小学教师张桂来信说：在广西，行商药贩几乎遍及各地，其中不少都是江湖骗子。一位教师向药贩买了眼药使用，结果反而把眼睛弄得红肿起来；有些药贩卖的鱼肝油是用麦芽糖配以极少量鱼肝油制成的，售价每瓶高达四万元至五万元不等；有的药贩把什么清凉丹、退热散、肚痛丸、血中宝等成药宣传成能治百病，结果害人不浅。江苏省嘉定县卫生院张师淳来信反映：我县经常有些药贩在街头兜售药品。有一次一个农民买了几包“伤包”，发现里面有很多小虫。那个商贩反说伤药里有虫是“好货”，理由是“有的伤虫一吃就好了”。河南陈留县发现一些卖眼药的商贩随身带着制药瓷碗、空眼药瓶以及硼酸、薄荷等原药，有人买药时就毫无标准地随便配制。江苏嘉定县有一个药贩向中药铺买了五万四千元伤药，改装成三百多小包，每包售价一千五百元，利润高达九倍。其它广东、江西、山西、吉林等省，也有读者来信反映了类似的情况。
    更严重的是，有些药贩冒充医生，胡乱替人治病，骗取诊费。湖北黄陂县卫生科反映：我县经常发现一些来自河南潢川、信阳的药贩，携带着听诊器替病人看病。有一个药贩在三区某村一天内骗取诊费一百多万元；一个慢性风湿关节炎患者一次就被骗去诊费十万元。保定附近农村也曾发生药贩替妇女治病时，把腐蚀性药品用在妇女阴道，结果造成子宫颈腐蚀，阴道壁形成愈合斑痕，影响了月经的正常排泄。
    此外，各地还有一些纸烟店、茶叶店、杂货店兼售各种药品；也有些中药店代销西药，西药房代售中药。有些代销店并不知道所售药品的用途、剂量和禁忌，因而造成了乱卖的情况。如四川崇庆县读者樊俊安反映：该县的中药店普遍代售磺胺噻唑、磺胺嘧啶、山道年、麻黄素等西药。有些代销店把各种磺胺药品统称为“消炎片”，错误地认为百病皆治。吉林延吉县有一中药铺卖麻黄素，告诉患者一次可服一瓶，几乎酿成人命事件。
    造成以上混乱情况的原因之一，是某些地区的卫生机关和工商行政部门对药商、药贩缺乏应有的教育和管理，甚至有的还擅自给不法药贩发各种证明。如在湖北黄陂县发现冒充医生的药贩，即持有河南潢川、信阳两县人民政府发给的流动营业许可证。江苏嘉定县更发现有些药贩持有当地区政府、文化馆或派出所发给的证件。有些卫生机关和工商管理部门的干部虽然知道这一情况的严重性，但又认为药贩在社会上流传已久，流动性太大，难以管理，因而采取不管不问的态度。这些显然不是对人民负责的态度。
    为有效进行医药市场管理、取缔药贩的非法行为，读者提出了如下的建议：一、凡经营药业者，特别是行商，应将营业地址及经销范围（如药品名称、适应症状、规格数量、产地等）详为说明，并具有合格的从业人员，报呈当地卫生部门和工商管理部门审查，经核准后才能经营。二、为了便于管理，应对药业行商采取限地营业的措施；药商经营药品不得超出当地政府已批准的成药及成方制剂和草药，严禁药贩自制自销。三、对那些招摇撞骗的药商、特别是冒充医生的药贩，要坚决予以取缔。
    适当组织施工技术人员
    在冬季停工时参加设计工作
    中央建筑工程部工业建筑公司直属工地洪钟亮、刘嘉其、袁昌仁来信：东北和华北的许多建筑单位到冬季一般就要停止施工，施工部门的技术人员就没有什么工作可做。为避免人力浪费，建议把施工部门适合于作设计工作的技术人员在冬休期间暂时调到设计部门去。这样做有以下两点好处：
  一、设计部门在冬季期间要搞好来年各项工程的设计，工作很忙。把施工部门的技术人员调来协助这一工作，就可以增强设计力量。同时可以使一批技术干部在冬季有工作可做。二、可以加强设计部门和施工部门的联系，避免某些脱节现象。因为施工单位的工作人员最容易发现某些设计的缺点。施工单位的人员利用寒冬期间把这些切身感受带给设计部门，可以使以后设计出来的图纸更加完善。
    希望有关部门周密慎重地考虑我们这个意见。
    编者按：读者洪钟亮等的意见基本上是正确的。经我们和中央建筑工程部办公厅联系，他们认为：在冬季施工问题未能很好解决以前，组织施工人员在冬季参加设计工作是有好处的。但目前国家计划尚未全部下达，一般设计部门冬季工作也不多，因而尚不可能大量组织施工人员参加设计工作。各地可视具体情况组织部分施工人员参加设计工作（特别是标准设计），事先应该组织施工部门与设计部门具体联系。
    有暖气设备的办公室里
    又生了火炉子
    读者武承、齐佩森来信：在北京西皇城根一座崭新的大楼的办公室里，安装了暖气，又生了火炉子，人们常常用怀疑的神态看待这个奇怪的事情。
    这幢大楼是一九五二年由华北基本建筑工程公司承建的。完工以后，华北群众团体行政事务管理处负责管理大楼。一年多来，一直为着暖气问题在伤脑筋。该楼原设计缺乏暖气设备，大楼盖好后才临时决定加装暖气。结果，打墙壁、穿楼板，总算把暖气装上了。可是据说暖气片太少了，因而暖气不暖，天冷的时候，工作人员只好戴起手套来办公。于是，决定再花二千六百万元增加暖气片。然而暖气片增加了，办公室里的温度并没有随着增加，据说根本原因是暖气路线的问题。于是又添造了一千五百万元的预算，准备修理暖气路线。但是，到底毛病出在什么地方，据说工程师也不知道。不久，冬天已经到了，紧接着寒潮袭来了，这幢大楼的管理机关只好来个“紧急措施”，在暖气房里生起了火炉子。
    暖气房里生火炉子这件事告诉我们：尽管是像安装暖气这样并不复杂的基本建设工程，如果缺乏周密的计划和认真的态度，也一定要碰钉子。
    不应该用敷衍的态度
    对待人民来信
    读者郭振生来信：我在黑龙江省肇东县昌五镇造林站工作。去年十一月五日我到县里农林科去时，农林科的王法政同志交给我一封群众批评昌五镇造林站造林没有计划而造成浪费的来信，要我马上写个答复。我向他说明：昌五镇造林栽苗时我还在村中工作，不了解当时情况。但他却说：“只要根据群众来信所揭发的材料检讨检讨就行。”在他催逼之下，我就胡乱地“造”了个检讨交给他。过后，我和昌五镇镇长研究了造林栽苗时的具体情况，发现我的检讨根本不对头。我就找王法政同志说明这个情况，并且提出：“我们不根据群众来信来检查和改进工作，而用敷衍的态度来对待群众的意见，这是不正确的。”但他说：“答复一下算了，都邮走啦！”这件事就这样结束了。经过很多天的考虑，我认识到这种欺骗群众的作风是非常恶劣的。我认为肇东县人民政府应该教育王法政同志端正对处理人民来信工作的认识，并且从新处理群众批评昌五镇造林站工作的这件人民来信。
