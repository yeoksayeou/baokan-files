    Private Shenxin Fourth Textile Company's Hankou Factory Transformed into Joint State-Private Enterprise
    The private Shenxin Fourth Textile Company's Hankou Factory in Wuhan has been transformed into a joint state-private enterprise on New Year's Day this year, and renamed the Joint State-Private Hankou Shenxin Textile Factory. The 20,000 spindles purchased by the Wuhan Municipal People's Government with investment are being installed. The workers are celebrating the joint state-private enterprise status of the factory by further increasing production and completing the new spindle installation plan ahead of schedule.
    Before liberation, the Shenxin Fourth Textile Company's Hankou Factory had been struggling with production under the dual oppression of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. When Wuhan was liberated in May 1949, only 40 percent of the factory's total spindles were in operation. In recent years, thanks to the support of the state, the factory's operations have turned from losses to profits, and the scale of production has also expanded. In 1949, it lost 1.4 billion yuan, but in 1953, it made a profit of 5 billion yuan. Last summer, equipment such as cold air blowers and sprayers were installed in the workshops. Last November, 5,200 new spindles were installed, and cotton suction devices were installed on 63 spinning frames.
    Originally, although the production of Shenxin Fourth Textile Company's Hankou Factory had significantly improved with the assistance of the government and the active efforts of the workers, its management methods were backward, and many production problems remained unresolved for a long time, hindering further improvement in production. Last year, after Li Guowei, the director of the general management office of the factory, participated in the National Congress of Members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce in Beijing, he further realized that private enterprises can only thoroughly improve business management, continue to improve production, and meet the needs of national economic construction and the people by taking the road of state capitalism. Therefore, he actively requested the implementation of joint state-private ownership.

### 私营申新第四纺织公司汉口厂改为公私合营

    私营申新第四纺织公司汉口厂改为公私合营
    武汉市私营申新第四纺织公司汉口厂，已在今年元旦改为公私合营，并改名为公私合营汉口申新纺织厂。武汉市人民政府投资购买的两万枚纱锭，正在安装。职工们正以进一步提高生产、提前完成新纱锭安装计划为保证，庆祝该厂的公私合营。
    解放前，申新第四纺织公司汉口厂在帝国主义和官僚资本主义的双重压迫下，生产一直不振。一九四九年五月武汉解放时，该厂全部纱锭仅开动了百分之四十。这几年来，由于国家的扶持，该厂经营由亏损转为盈余，生产规模也随着扩大。一九四九年亏损十四亿元，一九五三年就获得五十亿元的利润。去年夏天，在车间装置了冷风机和喷雾器等设备。去年十一月间，又新安装了五千二百枚纱锭，在六十三台细纱机上装置了吸棉器。
    原来申新第四纺织公司汉口厂经过政府的扶助和职工群众的积极努力，生产虽然显著提高，但管理方法落后，很多生产上的问题，长时期得不到解决，妨碍了生产的进一步提高。去年，该厂总管理处处长李国伟在北京参加了全国工商业联合会会员代表大会以后，进一步认识到私营企业唯有走国家资本主义的道路，才能彻底改善经营管理，继续提高生产，适应国家经济建设和人民的需要。因此积极要求实行公私合营。
