    Harbin Intensifies Construction Preparations
    Winter Training Fully Underway, Large Quantities of Materials Transported to Site
    Harbin is actively carrying out construction preparations for this year's capital construction projects.

    The scale of Harbin's capital construction this year greatly exceeds that of last year. Among this year's capital construction projects are China's largest electricity meter and instrument factory – the state-owned Harbin Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory, and China's largest boiler manufacturing plant – the state-owned Harbin Boiler Factory. The Harbin Large Electric Motor Manufacturing Plant, which was built last year, will undergo equipment installation this year and gradually begin production. In addition, there are large-scale buildings, hospitals, schools, technical training factories, and worker dormitories. This year's projects are not only massive in scale but also extremely complex in technical requirements. The city's metal structure engineering will increase by more than two times compared to last year, and equipment installation engineering will be several times larger than last year. The transportation of machinery and equipment for just one factory requires more than 15,000 train cars; some machines are so large that one requires more than twenty train cars for transport; the foundation for some machines requires 600 cubic meters of concrete, necessitating 150 tons of cement.

    To meet the requirements of the construction tasks, the city's winter training has now fully begun. Tens of thousands of construction site management cadres and technical personnel have begun training separately. The Municipal Winter Training Committee has printed 500 sets of wall charts, and relevant municipal departments have prepared films and slides to conduct appropriate visual education for workers. The city also attaches great importance to cultivating and training workers in special trades. For example, the Metal Structure Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration has conducted different technical training for workers according to professional teams.

    The Harbin Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee convened a city-wide capital construction materials supply meeting at the end of November last year to study this year's production volume and demand. Various units have also successively submitted local materials plans and signed purchase contracts. Currently, the city has allocated more than 430 million bricks, and more than 200 public and private factories have been organized to process more than 1.3 million pieces of plumbing and heating materials. At present, materials allocated by the state have arrived one after another, and local materials are also continuously being transported to the site. For example, most of the state-balanced materials for the Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory construction site have arrived, local materials have begun to enter the site, and 80% of the construction machinery and equipment will arrive in February this year, which can meet the needs of the first phase of construction.

    哈尔滨市加紧进行施工准备工作
    冬季训练全面开始，大批材料运入现场
    哈尔滨市正积极进行今年基本建设工程的施工准备工作。
    哈尔滨市今年基本建设规模大大超过去年。今年基本建设工程中，有我国最大的电表仪器厂——国营哈尔滨电表仪器厂，我国最大的锅炉制造厂——国营哈尔滨锅炉厂等。去年兴建的哈尔滨大型电机制造厂，今年将进行设备安装，并逐步投入生产。此外，还有大型的楼房、医院、学校、技术实习工厂和职工宿舍等工程。今年工程不仅工程巨大，而且技术要求也极为复杂。全市金属结构工程要比去年增加两倍以上，设备安装工程也比去年大数倍。仅一个厂运输机器设备的车皮就需要一万五千多个；有的机器很大，一台就要二十多个火车皮运输；有的机器基础就得打六百立方公尺的混凝土，需一百五十吨水泥。
    为适应施工任务的要求，目前该市冬季训练已全面开始。上万名工地管理干部和技术人员分别开始训练。市冬训委员会印制了五百套挂图，市有关部门准备了电影片、幻灯片向工人进行适当的形象教育。该市在培养训练特殊工种工人方面也极为重视。如有色金属工业管理局金属结构工程公司，已按专业队对工人进行了不同的技术训练。
    哈尔滨市人民政府财政经济委员会于去年十一月末召开了全市基本建设材料供应会议，研究了今年的生产量和需要量。各单位也都先后提出了地方材料计划，签订了订购合同。目前全市已分配红砖达四亿三千余万块，并已组织二百余家公、私营工厂，开始为一百三十余万件水暖材料加工。目前，国家分配材料已陆续到达，地方材料也源源运入现场。如电表仪器厂工地国家平衡材料大部分已到，地方材料已开始入场，施工机械设备今年二月份可到达百分之八十，可满足第一期施工需要。　（姜校民）
