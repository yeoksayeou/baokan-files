Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: According to Vietnam News Agency on January 3rd: The spokesman of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army commented on the situation in Indochina during the autumn and winter of 1953 at a press conference held on New Year's Day.

The spokesman said that the situation in the autumn and winter of 1953 had three characteristics: (1) Since the liberation of Lai Chau, an important town in the Northwest, the mountainous area of ​​northern Vietnam, except for Dien Bien Phu, the last stronghold of the French, has been basically liberated. From Cao Bang and Lang Son on the Vietnamese-Chinese border and Lai Chau to Hoa Binh and Son La on the Lao border, they have become the vast rear area of ​​Vietnam; (2) With the development of the armed struggle in Laos, the war has been carried out in the central Laos front, an important strategic area in central Indochina; (3) The enemy has been forced to disperse their mobile forces to Dien Bien Phu and central Laos.

The spokesman said that in the past four months, that is, during the most active period of Navarre, the enemy suffered a series of disastrous defeats: (1) In September 1953, the enemy launched a large-scale "sweep" in the northern part of Luc Nam area, but they did not achieve the goal of annihilating the People's Army, but suffered a loss of more than 3,000 casualties. Since then, the guerrilla warfare in the Red River Delta has become more active than before. (2) In October, the "Seagull Campaign" launched by the enemy in the southwest of Ninh Binh also suffered a complete failure, and 3,800 elite enemy troops were annihilated. (3) An important part of the "Navarre Plan" was to establish light infantry battalions of the puppet army. However, in the last four months of 1953, two battalions and fifteen companies of the puppet light infantry were annihilated. (4) The enemy gathered armed bandits to disturb our rear, but our army and people victoriously wiped out these bandits. In November 1953, more than 3,000 armed bandits were annihilated in Son La Province and southern Lai Chau. (5) In early December 1953, the enemy was forced to withdraw its troops from Lai Chau, an important town in the Northwest, but they could not escape the fate of being annihilated. Most of the enemy troops in Lai Chau Province, a total of 2,500 people, were annihilated. In order to defend the isolated Dien Bien Phu, the enemy had to concentrate ten mobile battalions there. (6) The enemy planned to attack the Fifth Interzone in central Vietnam and "pacify" South Vietnam. But in this way, the enemy would have to deal with the growing guerrillas in South Vietnam and the Fifth Interzone behind enemy lines. (7) In late December last year, the Lao People's Liberation Army won a brilliant victory in central Laos, annihilating 2,200 elite enemy troops and liberating 40,000 square kilometers of land and 400,000 people.

The spokesman pointed out that since Navarre came to Indochina in May 1953 until the end of 1953, the enemy had lost a total of 44,000 troops. The French commander-in-chief intended to gather enough mobile forces to launch a large-scale campaign, hoping to regain the military initiative. But now he has to disperse his troops and passively fight the people's army on many far-flung fronts. This is Navarre's biggest failure. At the beginning of the autumn and winter of 1953, the enemy concentrated 44 mobile battalions in the Red River Delta. But now they have to send two-fifths of this force to Dien Bien Phu and central Laos. This is extremely dangerous for the enemy when the situation is getting more and more serious for them, and it is a headache for both Navarre and his American masters.

The spokesman finally pointed out that the more disastrous the enemy's defeat, the more frantic they will become. Therefore, we should remain highly vigilant and be ready to crush the enemy's new conspiracies at any time. With the arrival of the New Year, we are confident that we will achieve greater victories.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: According to Vietnam News Agency: The Vietnam People's Army is actively fighting in various parts of North Vietnam and continues to gain victories.

A communiqué issued on January 3rd said that on December 29, 1953, the local troops of the Vietnam People's Army intercepted an enemy company north of Dien Bien Phu, annihilating two platoons of enemy troops, most of whom were European and African.

On December 26, 1953, in an ambush by the local troops of the People's Army on Highway 17, eight kilometers northeast of Hua Nai in Quang Yen Province, 84 enemy troops were killed and 17 were captured. In addition, the people's armed forces in Bac Ninh Province ambushed the enemy on the Dong River, 12 kilometers east of Hanoi, killing 50 enemy troops.

    越南人民军总部发言人
    评述印度支那去年秋冬两季战况
    【新华社四日讯】据越南通讯社三日讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人在元旦举行的记者招待会上评述了一九五三年秋冬两季的印度支那战况。
    发言人说：一九五三年秋冬两季的战况有三个特点：（一）自从西北重镇莱州解放以后，越南北部山区除了法国的最后据点奠边府以外，已基本上解放了。从越、中边界的高平、谅山和莱州直到寮国边界的和平和山萝都已成为越南广大的后方；（二）随着寮国武装斗争的发展，战争已经在印度支那中部的重要战略区域——寮国中部战线上进行；（三）敌人已被迫把他们的机动部队分散到奠边府和寮国中部去。
    发言人说：在过去的四个月中，也就是纳瓦尔最活跃的一段时期中，敌人遭到了一连串的惨重的失败：（一）一九五三年九月，敌人在禄江北部地区发动了大规模的“扫荡战”，但他们没有达到歼灭人民军的目的，反而遭受了伤亡三千多人的损失。自此以后，红河三角洲的游击战比以前更加活跃了。（二）在十月间，敌人在宁平西南所发动的“海鸥战役”又遭到了彻底的失败，敌军的三千八百名精锐部队被歼灭了。（三）“纳瓦尔计划”的一个重要部分就是建立伪军轻装营。但是，在一九五三年的最后四个月中，伪军轻装部队的两个营和十五个连被歼灭了。（四）敌人纠集武装匪徒来扰乱我们的后方，但我们的军民胜利地肃清了这些匪徒。一九五三年十一月，在山萝省内和莱州南部歼灭了武装匪徒三千多名。（五）一九五三年十二月初，敌人被迫把军队从西北重镇莱州撤走，但是，他们逃脱不了被歼灭的命运。莱州省内的敌军大部，共有二千五百人被歼灭了。敌人为了防守孤立的奠边府，不得不把十个机动营集中在那里。（六）敌人打算进攻中越南部的第五联区，并“绥靖”南越。但是，这样敌人就要去对付南越和第五联区的在敌人后方的日益壮大的游击队。（七）去年十二月下旬，寮国人民解放军在寮国中部获得了辉煌的胜利，歼灭了二千二百名敌军精锐部队。解放了四万平方公里土地和四十万人口。
    发言人指出：自从纳瓦尔在一九五三年五月来到印度支那起到一九五三年年底止，敌人共损失兵员四万四千名。这位法军总司令打算要集结足够的机动部队来发动大规模的战役，希望重新取得军事主动权。但是，现在他不得不把他的军队分散开，被动地在许多相距遥远的战线上与人民的军队作战。这是纳瓦尔的最大的失败。一九五三年秋冬之初，敌人在红河三角洲集中了四十四个机动营。但是，现在他们不得不把这支部队的五分之二派到奠边府和寮国中部去。在形势对他们越来越严重的时候，这对敌人是极其危险的，这是纳瓦尔和他的美国主子都很头痛的事。
    发言人最后指出：但是，敌人的失败愈是惨重，他们就会愈加疯狂。因此，我们应该保持高度的警惕，随时准备粉碎敌人的新阴谋。随着新年的来到，我们确信我们将取得更大的胜利。
    【新华社四日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军在北越各地积极作战，继续获得胜利。
    一月三日发表的公报说：一九五三年十二月二十九日，越南人民军地方部队在奠边府以北截击敌军一个连，歼灭大部分是欧非籍的敌军二个排。
    一九五三年十二月二十六日，人民军地方部队在广安省化乃东北八公里第十七号公路上的伏击战中，击毙敌军八十四名，俘掳十七名。另外，北宁省的人民武装在河内以东十二公里的东河上伏击敌军，毙敌五十名。
