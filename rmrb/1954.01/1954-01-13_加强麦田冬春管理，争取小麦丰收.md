    Strengthen Winter and Spring Management of Wheat Fields, Strive for a Bumper Wheat Harvest
    Central People's Government, Ministry of Agriculture, General Administration of Agricultural Production
    Currently, wheat-producing regions such as Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have successively strengthened fertilization management of wheat fields. This is a timely and important task for increasing wheat yield. However, some cadres and farmers in other regions do not understand that besides doing a good job in tilling and sowing to achieve full and strong seedlings, winter and spring management of wheat fields, protecting wheat seedlings through the cold winter, and providing sufficient water and nutrients are also extremely important for the healthy growth of wheat and increasing yield per unit area.
    A major task in the winter and spring management of wheat fields is to pay attention to applying topdressing fertilizer. Applying topdressing fertilizer not only provides the nutrients needed by wheat when it turns green, making the seedlings grow strong, but also increases the seedlings' resistance to disasters such as freezing, frost, rust, and scab. Last year, in some areas, most of the summer fertilizer accumulation was used for autumn crops, resulting in a general reduction in the amount of base fertilizer applied to wheat fields. In particular, during the wheat planting season last year, about a quarter of the wheat fields nationwide suffered varying degrees of drought and flood disasters, and the sowing period in some wheat fields was delayed by more than a month compared to previous years. Tilling and sowing operations were also relatively crude. Under these circumstances, many wheat fields were short of seedlings, and the seedlings were also weaker, making timely topdressing even more important for remediation. Topdressing can use decomposed manure, soybean cake, human excrement, fertilizer powder, river mud, pond mud, etc. In the north, topdressing should be done before the wheat turns green in early spring, while in the south, where the season is earlier, it can be done in winter. Using human urine as topdressing fertilizer for wheat fields has a very good fertilizer effect. According to a survey in Shandong Province, applying accumulated urine to wheat in winter can increase yield by an average of 18%. However, many areas in the north still do not have the habit of accumulating and preserving human urine as fertilizer and should be vigorously encouraged to do so. Some farmers in some areas are accustomed to applying manure fertilizer on top of the soil in wheat fields during topdressing, resulting in nutrient loss. Farmers should be educated to change this fertilizing habit.
    In northern regions with water conservancy conditions, irrigation should also be combined with early spring topdressing. Early spring irrigation can not only promote fertilizer dissolution, making it easier for wheat seedlings to absorb, and provide the necessary moisture for wheat seedlings to turn green and grow, but also maintain soil temperature,缓和 local temperature changes, and prevent spring cold damage. Around Qingming, when there are windy days followed by clear, cloudless evenings and a sudden drop in temperature, special attention should be paid to watering to prevent late frost damage. Last spring, wheat fields in Anhui, Henan, and other places that were watered in time before the frost suffered less damage. For example, at the Anhui Su County Special District Farm, the survival rate of young ears in wheat fields watered two days before the frost reached 61.6%; the survival rate of young ears in a nearby unwatered wheat field was only 18.1%. Timely watering after wheat seedlings suffer frost damage can also reduce losses. According to surveys and summaries from various places in Shandong, wheat watered within seven days after being damaged by frost yielded an average of 46.6% more than those not watered. In southern wheat fields, attention should be paid to drainage in winter and spring. This work can be combined with winter and spring wheat field cultivation and earthing, to clean up drainage ditches.
    Doing a good job in wheat field cultivation management is also an important task. In the north, attention should be paid to harrowing in early spring, especially in wheat fields with narrow rows and dense planting, where weeding is inconvenient, spring harrowing is even more necessary. Spring harrowing can break up the hard crust on the ground caused by autumn and winter rain and snow, reduce soil moisture evaporation, allow soil air to circulate, facilitate microbial activity, and increase nutrients. In addition, it can also rake away weeds and withered leaves in the wheat field, which is conducive to wheat seedling growth. According to the results of experiments at the Shandong Wucheng County Farm, spring harrowing increased wheat yield by 11.3% compared to no spring harrowing. In principle, the earlier the time for spring harrowing, the better. As long as the ground begins to thaw and can be harrowed, spring harrowing should be carried out in conjunction with topdressing in a timely manner. When harrowing, harrow horizontally and diagonally, not along the ridges. Sandy soil and soil with a high sand content, where no hard crust has formed on the ground, can be left unharrowed, but should be compacted. In the south, weeding should be done once in conjunction with cleaning drainage ditches and earthing. Then, depending on the growth of weeds in the field, weed once or twice more. In northern wheat fields, weeding should also be done once or twice after the spring thaw in conjunction with watering, in order to remove weeds and conserve moisture. The experimental results of the Shandong Tai'an Special District Farm showed that wheat fields weeded twice yielded 35 jin more per mu than those weeded once, but those weeded three times yielded only 18 jin more than those weeded once, which shows that proper weeding is necessary, but there is no need for excessive weeding.
    In addition, attention should also be paid to preventing frost damage to reduce the winter mortality of wheat seedlings. Summarizing the experience of various places in preventing wheat frost damage, the basic methods for preventing frost are to carry out deep plowing and early plowing of wheat fields before sowing, and to plant appropriately densely, apply more base fertilizer, and sow at the appropriate time to make the wheat seedlings grow strong and enhance the soil's ability to retain water and keep warm. In winter, in northern drylands, proper compaction can be carried out before freezing to block soil gaps and ground cracks, so that wheat roots are in close contact with the soil to prevent wind penetration and freezing. When more watery clay soils cannot be compacted before freezing, they can be compacted after freezing. In spring thawing and in some warmer winter areas, there is often a phenomenon of freezing at night and thawing during the day. If this happens, timely compaction should also be carried out to prevent the wheat roots from being pulled up and dying when freezing and thawing occur. In southern wheat fields, pond mud, river mud, or ditch bottom soil can be piled on the wheat roots in conjunction with winter topdressing and repairing drainage ditches, which can also play a role in preventing cold and protecting seedlings. Last year, in Jinghai County, Hebei Province, the wheat seedlings that had been compacted by the Gao Jinkun Agricultural Production Cooperative rarely froze to death; 20% of the wheat seedlings that had not been compacted froze to death. In Jinyi Township, Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, the sandy soil fields that were compacted once after the cold wave retained twice as many seedlings as those that were not compacted. At present, if it is found that wheat seedlings are growing too vigorously and may be damaged by frost, compaction should be carried out along the ridges immediately to suppress seedling growth and prevent frost damage.

    加强麦田冬春管理，争取小麦丰收
    中央人民政府农业部农业生产总局
    目前河南、安徽、江苏等省的小麦产区，先后加强了对小麦田的施肥管理，这是提高小麦产量的一项适时的重要的工作。但是，还有一些地区的干部和农民不了解小麦能不能很好生长，单位面积产量能不能提高，除了必须作好整地、播种等工作，达到苗全苗壮外，进行麦田冬春管理，保护麦苗越过寒冬，供给麦苗足够的水分、养料等也是十分重要的工作。
    麦田冬春管理工作中主要的一项是注意施用追肥。施用追肥，不仅可以供给小麦返青时所需要的养料，使麦苗生长茁壮，还可以增加麦苗对冻、霜、锈病、赤霉病等灾害的抵抗能力。去年有些地区，由于夏季积肥大部用于秋禾，麦田基肥的用量普遍减少。特别是去年种麦季节，全国约有四分之一的麦田遭受了不同程度的旱、涝灾害，有部分麦田播种期比往年延后了一个多月，整地、播种工作也都比较粗放。在这种情况下，有不少麦田缺苗，同时麦苗生长也较弱，因此及时追肥补救更有重要意义。追肥可用腐熟的厩肥、豆饼、人粪尿、肥田粉、河泥、塘泥等。追肥时间，在北方应在早春麦苗返青前，南方季节较早，可在冬季。用人尿作麦田追肥的肥效很好，据山东省调查，冬季积尿浇麦平均可增产百分之十八。但目前北方还有许多地区没有积尿和保存人尿作肥料的习惯，应大力提倡。有些地区的农民在施追肥时习惯把粪肥施在麦田的表土上面，以致肥分损失，应教育农民改变这种施肥习惯。
    北方有水利条件地区，还应该结合早春追肥适时灌溉。早春灌溉不仅可以促使肥料溶解，便于麦苗吸收，供给麦苗返青生长时必需的水分，同时还可以保持地温，缓和局部温度变化，防止春寒为害。清明前后，遇到白天刮风，傍晚天气晴朗无云，温度突然下降时，更要注意浇水，以防止晚霜为害。去年春天安徽、河南等地霜前适时浇水的麦田，受害都轻。如安徽宿县专区农场在霜前二天浇过水的麦田，霜害后幼穗存活率达到百分之六十一点六；临近一块没有浇水的麦田的幼穗存活率只有百分之十八点一。麦苗遭受霜害以后，及时浇水也可减少损失。据山东各地调查总结，小麦受霜害后七天内浇水的比不浇水的平均多产百分之四十六点六。南方麦田则应重视冬春季排水工作。这一工作，可结合冬春麦田中耕培土，进行清理排水沟。
    作好麦田的中耕管理也是一项重要工作。在北方应重视早春耙地工作，特别是实行窄行密植的麦田，中耕锄草不便，更须进行春耙。春耙可以耙碎因秋冬雨雪而形成的地面硬壳，减少土壤水分蒸发，使土壤空气流通，便于微生物活动，增加养分。此外还可以耙去麦田中的杂草枯叶，有利于麦苗生长。据山东省武城县农场试验的结果，春耙小麦的比不春耙的增产百分之十一点三。春耙的时间原则上愈早愈好，只要地面开始化冻，可以耙动时，便应结合追肥及时进行春耙。耙时要横耙、斜耙，不要顺垄耙，沙土地和沙性较重的地，地面没有硬壳形成，可以不耙，但应进行镇压。在南方应结合清理排水沟和培土工作锄一次草。以后根据田间杂草生长情况，再锄一、二次。北方麦田也应该在开春后结合浇水锄一、二次，以便除草保墒。山东省泰安专区农场试验结果，锄两遍比锄一遍的麦田，每亩增产三十五斤，但锄三遍的比锄一遍的只增产十八斤，这说明适当锄麦是必要的，但不须多锄。
    此外，目前还要注意防止冻害，以减少麦苗冬季死亡。总结各地防止小麦冻害的经验。防冻的基本办法是在播种前对麦田实行深耕、早耕，并且适当密植、多施基肥、适期播种，使麦苗生长茁壮，增强土壤保水、保温力量。在冬季，北方旱地上冻前可适当进行镇压，以堵塞土壤空隙及地面裂缝，使麦根与土壤密接，防止透风受冻；含水较多的粘土地在冻前不能镇压时，可在上冻以后再行镇压。在春季开冻时和有些冬季较暖的地区，常有晚上冻，白天化的现象。如遇这种情况，也要适时镇压，防止一冻一化时麦根被拔起致死。南方麦田并可结合冬季追肥和整修排水沟，将塘泥、河泥或沟底泥土培壅在麦根上，也可起到防寒保苗作用。去年河北省静海县高进昆农业生产合作社经过镇压的麦苗冻死的就很少；没有镇压的麦苗冻死了百分之二十。江苏省泰兴县金堡乡沙土田在寒流后经过镇压一遍的比不镇压的多保住一倍的苗。目前如发现麦苗生长过旺，有遭受冻害可能时，应即顺垄进行镇压，以抑制麦苗生长，防止冻害。
