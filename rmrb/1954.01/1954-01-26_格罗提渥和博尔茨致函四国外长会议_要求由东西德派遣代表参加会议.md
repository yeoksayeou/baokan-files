Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 25th: According to TASS, German Democratic Republic Premier Otto Grotewohl and Foreign Minister Lothar Bolz wrote letters on the 24th to the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France at the Berlin Conference, stating that the government of the German Democratic Republic believes this Four Foreign Ministers Conference is an important opportunity to further ease international tensions. Resolving the German question in a peaceful and democratic manner is extremely important for achieving this goal, especially for strengthening and guaranteeing peace in Europe.

The government of the German Democratic Republic hopes that the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference will promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and facilitate the reunification of Germany into a democratic, peaceful, and independent nation. The effective resolution of this issue is in the interests of the German people and all other peoples of Europe.

The government of the German Democratic Republic emphasizes that the German people have the right to send representatives to participate in all discussions concerning the German question. Without the participation of the German people, the German question cannot be resolved peacefully and democratically. The current Germany is not a unified country, therefore representatives must be sent to the meeting from both parts of Germany.

The government of the German Democratic Republic requests the Four Foreign Ministers Berlin Conference to allow representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to participate in the discussions on the German question at the meeting. It is believed that the participation of representatives from both parts of Germany in all discussions concerning the German question will help the meeting to proceed smoothly.

    格罗提渥和博尔茨致函四国外长会议
    要求由东西德派遣代表参加会议
   【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥和外交部部长博尔茨在二十四日写信给苏、美、英、法四国外长柏林会议说：德意志民主共和国政府认为，这次四国外长会议是进一步缓和国际紧张局势的重要机会。以和平和民主的方式解决德国问题对于达到这个目的，特别是对于加强和保证欧洲和平，是非常重要的。
    德意志民主共和国政府希望柏林四国外长会议将促进对德和约的缔结，促使德国重新统一为一个民主的、和平的、独立的国家。这个问题的有效解决，是符合于德国人民的利益和欧洲所有其他人民的利益的。
    德意志民主共和国政府强调：德国人民有权派代表参加所有有关德国问题的讨论，如果没有德国人民参加，德国问题就不可能得到和平和民主的解决。目前的德国并不是一个统一的国家，因此必须由德国的两部分派遣代表参加会议。
    德意志民主共和国政府要求四国外长柏林会议允许德意志民主共和国代表和西德代表参加会议上关于德国问题的讨论。相信德国两部分的代表参加所有关于德国的问题的讨论将有助于会议的顺利进行。
