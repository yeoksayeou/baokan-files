The Northeast Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences convened a meeting of directors of Northeast research institutes in Shenyang in December 1953, initially summarizing the work of 1953 and discussing the work for this year.

　　The meeting first affirmed the achievements of the various research institutes. For example, the improvement of blast furnace bricks solved the key problem of calcining clinker for furnace bricks and increased the daily output of clinker by 27 percent; copper ore dressing in Rehe Province provided important data for the country to utilize this resource, with the concentrate recovery rate exceeding the planned target by 3 percent; the extraction of superheated cylinder oil and automotive engine oil from petroleum solved the problem of two types of lubricating oil that could not be produced domestically in the past but were urgently needed for machinery and transportation; successful development was also achieved in high-pressure oil pump design and trial production, trial production of a 50-ton universal material testing machine, trial production of a 1,500x microscope, manufacturing of insulating steel paper, and manufacturing of low-freezing-point lubricating oil, adding many advanced new products for the country; the utilization and promotion of Korean pine bark can save the country 80,000 cubic meters of raw wood annually for a certain paper mill alone, and can reduce costs by 40 billion yuan; the soybean rhizobia successfully researched last year has been widely promoted in 1.09 million hectares of soybean planting areas in the Northeast, increasing soybean production. These research results have made certain contributions to national industrial construction, national defense construction, and agriculture. In 1953, 90 percent of the researchers in the Northeast Branch and various research institutes completed Russian language crash courses and carried out the work of translating Soviet scientific literature, laying a good foundation for learning from the Soviet Union in the future. Many researchers also compiled academic research papers, which played a good role in exchanging academic experience and promoting research results. In addition, all employees strengthened the planning of research work and improved work efficiency.

　　The meeting focused on discussing the key points of work in 1954. In the first quarter, research work should ensure the plans for more than 30 research projects related to national construction are completed, and accurate data is provided; preparatory work should be done well, such as strengthening material supply, improving the efficiency of administrative work, and strengthening the planning of research work, in order to change the phenomenon of being relaxed first and then tense in previous years.

　　The meeting criticized certain unrealistic ideas in the current leadership work. For example, some leaders do not have a sufficient understanding of the fact that the development of scientific research must be subordinate to national construction, and therefore there are fewer research topics addressing major national economic problems in the 1954 research plan. The meeting pointed out that this phenomenon must be corrected.

　　The meeting discussed how to effectively organize manpower and material resources to ensure the realization of the research plan after the research institutes have formulated their research plans. It pointed out that the current idea of some researchers looking down on analysis and testing work is incorrect. Last year, very few graduates from universities and colleges were assigned to analytical chemistry research, and this situation must be quickly improved. The meeting believes that with the development of national construction, various analysis, testing, and appraisal work related to basic construction design, construction, and industrial production are becoming increasingly complex. In the future, research institutions should pay special attention to the analysis and testing work of heavy industry and the 141 large enterprises newly built and renovated with Soviet assistance. To this end, efforts must be made to improve the level of analysis and testing work, assist the leading departments of relevant enterprises, and do this work well to meet the needs of national construction.

　　The meeting also discussed the training of cadres and learning from the Soviet Union. It proposed that in 1954, the focus should be on strengthening the writing and review of research reports and vigorously learning from advanced Soviet science and technology to train cadres and improve the level of scientific research work. The meeting formulated specific methods, planning to translate more than 3 million words of Soviet literature throughout the year, and together with research reports, papers, technical materials, etc., it is estimated that more than 5 million words will be compiled and published. The meeting also emphasized that the training of cadres should first have a clear purpose and must be closely linked to reality.

　　The meeting finally emphasized that scientific research personnel should strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, continue to criticize bourgeois ideology, and carry out work in accordance with the spirit of the general line and general task of the country's transition period.

　　中国科学院东北分院召开研究所所长会议
　　讨论如何加强领导改进科学研究工作
    中国科学院东北分院于一九五三年十二月间在沈阳召开了东北各研究所所长会议，初步总结了一九五三年的工作，讨论了今年的工作。
    会议首先肯定了各研究所的工作成绩。如高炉砖生产之改进，解决了炉砖熟料烧成之关键问题，并提高日产熟料量百分之二十七；热河铜矿选矿，提供了国家利用该项资源的重要数据，精矿收率较预订目标高出百分之三；从石油中提制过热汽缸油及车用机油，解决了过去国内不能生产而为机械及交通运输上迫切需要的二种润滑油；高压油泵设计及试制、五十吨万能材料试验机试制、一千五百倍显微镜试制、绝缘钢纸制造、低凝固点润滑油之制造等，都获得成功，为国家增添了许多高级新产品；红松板皮的利用及推广，仅某纸厂每年即可为国家节约原木八万立方公尺，并可减低成本四百亿元；去年研究成功之大豆根瘤菌，已在东北一百零九万垧大豆种植地区普遍推广，提高了大豆的产量。这些研究成果对于国家工业建设、国防建设及农业都有着一定的贡献。在一九五三年间，东北分院及各研究所有百分之九十的研究人员完成了俄文速成学习，进行了翻译苏联科学文献的工作，为今后学习苏联打下了良好的基础。许多研究人员还编著了学术研究论文，对交流学术经验、推广研究成果起了良好作用。此外，全体职工加强了研究工作的计划性，提高了工作效率。
      关于一九五四年的工作重点，会议着重地进行了讨论。在第一季度内，研究工作应保证有关国家建设的三十余项研究工作的计划，提出准确数据；做好准备工作，如加强器材供应、提高行政工作效率、加强研究工作的计划性等，以改变往年先松后紧的现象。
    会议对目前领导工作中的某些不切合实际的思想作了批判。如有些领导人员对于科学研究事业之发展必须服从国家建设这一点认识不足，因而在一九五四年研究计划中解决国民经济重大问题的研究题目较少。会议指出这种现象必须纠正。
    对各研究所在制订研究计划以后，如何有效地组织人力物力，以保证研究计划实现的问题，会议作了讨论。指出目前有些研究人员轻视分析检验工作的思想是不对的。去年大专学校毕业生分配到分析化学研究方面的很少，这个情况必须迅速改善。会议认为，随着国家建设的开展，有关基本建设设计施工及工业生产之各种分析检验鉴定工作，日益繁杂，今后研究机关应该特别重视重工业及苏联帮助我国新建与改建的一百四十一项大企业建设的分析检验工作。为此，要努力提高分析检验工作的水平，协助有关企业的领导部门，做好这一工作，以适应和满足国家建设之需要。
    会议还讨论了培养干部和学习苏联的问题。提出一九五四年应以加强研究报告之编写、审查及大力学习苏联先进科学技术为中心，来培养干部及提高科学研究工作水平。会议制订了具体的办法，计划全年翻译苏联文献三百余万字，连同研究报告、论文、技术资料等预计将编译出版五百余万字。会议并着重指出，培养干部工作首先应有明确的目的性，必须密切联系实际来进行。
  会议最后着重指出，科学研究人员要加强马克思列宁主义学习，继续批判资产阶级思想，根据国家过渡时期总路线总任务的精神进行工作。
