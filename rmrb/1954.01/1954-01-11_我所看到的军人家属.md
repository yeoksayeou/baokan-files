What I Have Seen of Military Families

“The Masses Really Know You!”

In Kuan'an Township, Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, people always praise Wei Xiuzhen when they mention her: "She's a good one, one of the best in the county!"

Wei Xiuzhen is a female Communist Party member of the Bouyei ethnic group, a first-class production model and a military family model in the county. After the Resist America, Aid Korea movement started, she sent her husband, Wang Yunxian, to join the Chinese People's Volunteers, and she took the lead in organizing an agricultural production mutual aid team at home, using production to support Wang Yunxian. In production, she slowly learned how to weed, transplant rice seedlings, thresh, and plow. Once, she heard many moving stories about repairing ponds in the county, so she discussed the matter of repairing ponds with the chairman of the farmers' association. When the topic of repairing ponds came up, there were many opinions from the masses. One said: "Some of the wells dug in the past were like latrine pits. Now you want to repair ponds!" Another said, "One nail can only manage one eye, how can you take care of so many!" Wei Xiuzhen explained the benefits of repairing ponds to the masses, and first went to repair the ponds with the active elements. She helped solve the difficulties in production and life for the masses one by one. After a few days of repairs, the masses were deeply moved and signed up to participate. Under the leadership of Wei Xiuzhen, more than seventy women participated in the repairing of the pond. In all of the more than two thousand workdays, women did three hundred and eighty-nine workdays. The repaired pond can store 40,000 cubic meters of water, irrigating 3,200 *tiao* of fields.

Usually, Wei Xiuzhen also cares about the lives of the masses. Once, Long Hui's family had difficulties in their life and wanted to sell their cattle. When she found out, she dissuaded them and lent them more than one *shi* of her surplus grain. Last summer, there was a famine there, and she tried to help Xie Qiming and others sell their pears, solving their production and life difficulties.

Last year, in the grassroots elections in Kuan'an Township, the masses elected her as a representative of the township people and a member of the township people's government. Old Grandma Yan Zhang said: "The masses really know you!" (Ouyang Zhen)

Yi Military Family Model Father Li

In the winter of 1951, a meritorious service announcement was sent from the Korean front to Cigou Village, Yuhua Township, Ninth District, Kunming City, Yunnan Province, and to the hands of Yi elder Li Fayuan. Li Fayuan looked at his son Li Ming's meritorious service announcement, feeling unspeakably happy, and said that he would work hard to produce and support the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Li Fayuan was already an old man in his sixties, but he worked like a strong young man. He led his family to participate in the production mutual aid team, improved farming methods, and increased grain production by 40%, and was named a production model and a military family model. There are many wild animals in the mountains near Cigou Village, and they often go out to steal crops at night. Li Fayuan came up with a way to capture wild animals. He created a kind of wire mesh with bells attached to it. When it was almost dark, he put the net at the entrance of the cave. As soon as the wild animals came out of the cave, the bells would ring, and he would take everyone to catch them. By May of last year, he had captured twenty-seven wild boars, five roe deer, and twenty muntjacs. This method is easy to capture wild animals and can save ammunition. It has now been promoted throughout the township. Therefore, he was also named a county-level animal prevention model. People in the village affectionately call him "Military Family Model Father Li".

“It’s all for everyone’s benefit!”

Night. A cultivation team of the Rao Xingli Agricultural Production Cooperative was holding a meeting. More than a dozen members were crowded in a room, filled with smoke. After Rao Xingli finished speaking, the room fell silent.

"I will sell the 800 *jin* of grain that I saved to the country!" This sentence suddenly broke the silence. I quickly asked, "Who is this?" The cultivation team leader told me: "Martyr's family member Hu Youmin." I saw a kind and amiable old man under the dim light, sitting quietly there, his wrinkled face showing a serious and happy smile.

Hu Youmin is from Xishui County, Hubei Province. His third son, Hu Zuyi, joined the Chinese People's Volunteers in 1951 and unfortunately died heroically in January last year. His son's death brought him endless grief; however, the government and the people's care and concern for him gradually calmed him down. At the same time, he vowed to produce well and support the Chinese People's Volunteers to avenge his son. In 1952, he joined the Rao Xingli Agricultural Production Cooperative. Last year, the members helped him build a new house, and the bricks and tiles were made by the members themselves. After the completion of the new house, the local people also gave him many furnishings, and the house was arranged neatly and cleanly. He said to me: "Zuyi sacrificed for everyone to live a good life; now, the government is calling on us to sell surplus grain, isn't it just to make our good life even better? It's all for everyone's benefit!"

Following Chairman Mao Will Bring a Good Life

In early September of last year, the news that the People's Government was calling for the sale of surplus grain reached Qinggang Mountain, Daxin Township, Eleventh District, Xinhua County, Hunan Province. Ouguan Dao, an old man living here, immediately convened a family meeting, calculated the detailed accounts, and decided to sell all of his more than 1,000 *jin* of surplus grain to the country.

Ouguan Dao is already fifty-four years old. His eldest son, Ou Linyuan, joined the Chinese People's Volunteers in 1950, and his second son is studying in a middle school in the county. He has become the main labor force in the family. His family has more than five *mu* of land, of which three *mu* and nine *fen* are paddy fields, and the annual total output is always around 1,900 *jin*. Last year, due to his improved farming techniques and hard work, he achieved a rare bumper harvest in the mountainous area in autumn. Only more than four *mu* of land harvested 3,118 *jin* of dry rice, with an average yield of more than 688 *jin* per *mu*. After the rice was harvested, he actively prepared to pay patriotic public grain, selected the good ones, dried them for three days, and stored them separately, waiting for the date of paying public grain. When the date arrived, he took out three kinds of rice, Taoyuan He, Shengli Xian, and Wanli Xian, which he had stored separately, and let the inspectors choose. Two days before delivering the grain, his foot was injured by a stone, and he could not deliver the grain himself, so he mobilized his wife and daughter-in-law to deliver the grain and delivered the public grain to the destination on time.

Ouguan Dao knows very well how his good life came about, so when the People's Government called for the sale of surplus grain, he sold his surplus grain to the country again. He said: "I will never forget Chairman Mao's concern for the peasants. Following him will bring a good life!"

    我所看到的军人家属
    “群众到底把你看准了！”
    在贵州省贵筑县宽堰乡，人们一提起韦秀珍，就称赞说：好样的，全县数一数二的呀！
    韦秀珍是布依族的女共产党员，县里的一等生产模范和军属模范。抗美援朝运动起来后，她就送丈夫王云先参加了志愿军，自己在家带头组织了个农业生产互助组，用生产来支援王云先。在生产中，她慢慢地学会了薅秧、插秧，也学会了打谷子、犁地。有一次，她在县里听到了许多修塘的动人故事，就和农会主席商量修塘的事。一提起修塘，群众的意见可多了，这个说：“过去挖的井，有些就活像茅坑坑，现在还修塘哩！”那个说：“一个钉子只能管一个眼，那能顾得这么多！”韦秀珍就一面向群众说明修塘的好处，一面和积极分子先去修塘。群众中生产和生活上的困难，她都一一帮他们解决了。修了几天以后，群众都大受感动，就纷纷报名参加。在韦秀珍带领下，就有七十多个妇女参加了修塘，在全部二千多个工中，妇女就做了三百八十九个工。修的塘能蓄水四万方，灌田三千二百挑。
    平常，韦秀珍也很关心群众的生活。龙惠之家中有一次生活发生了困难，要把耕牛卖掉，她知道了就去劝阻，并把自己多余的一石谷子借给他。去年夏天，她们那里发生了灾荒，她想办法帮助谢启明等把梨子卖出去了，解决了他们的生产和生活上的困难。
    去年，在宽堰乡的基层选举中，群众把她选为乡人民代表和乡人民政府的委员。老奶奶严张氏说：“群众到底把你看准了！”（欧阳震）
    彝族军属模范李大爹
    一九五一年冬季，一张立功喜报从朝鲜前线送到了云南省昆明市郊第九区雨花乡茨沟村，送到了彝族老人李发元的手里。李发元看着儿子李明的立功喜报，心里有说不出的高兴，并表示要努力生产，来支援志愿军。
    李发元已经是六十开外的老人了，可是干起活来还顶个壮年人。他带领全家参加了生产互助组，改善了耕作方法，增产了四成粮食，被评为生产模范和军属模范。茨沟村附近的山里多野兽，夜间常常外出偷吃庄稼，李发元就想办法来捕野兽。他创造了一种铁丝网，网上系着铃子，天快黑时就把网放在洞口，野兽一出洞，铃便发出响声，这时，他就带着大家去捉。到去年五月，他已捕了野猪二十七只，獐子五只，麂子二十只。这种方法，既易捕捉野兽，又可节省弹药，现在已在全乡推广了。因此，他又被评为县里的防兽模范。村里的人都亲昵地称他为“军属模范李大爹”。

    “都是为了大家好！”
    夜。饶兴礼农业生产合作社的一个耕作小组在开会，十多个社员挤在一间房子里，到处充满了烟雾。饶兴礼刚刚说完了话，屋里即呈现出一片沉静。
    “我节约的八百斤粮食，都卖给国家！”这句话突然打破了沉静。我连忙问：“这是谁？”耕作组长告诉我：“烈属胡佑民。”我从暗淡的灯光下，看到一个和善可亲的老人，安静地坐在那里，他堆满皱纹的脸上，露出严肃、愉快的笑容。
    胡佑民是湖北省浠水县人，他的第三个儿子胡祖义一九五一年报名参加了志愿军，不幸在去年一月间光荣牺牲。儿子的死，曾给他带来了无限的悲痛；但政府和人民对他的照顾和关怀，使他逐渐安静下来，同时立志要好好生产，支援志愿军，来替儿子报仇。一九五二年，他参加了饶兴礼农业生产合作社。去年，社员们帮助他盖了一所新房子，砖、瓦都是社员们亲手烧成的。新房落成后，当地人民还送给他许多陈设的东西，屋子里布置得整齐而又干净。他对我说：“祖义牺牲，就是为了大家过好日子；如今，政府号召咱们卖余粮，还不是为了使好日子过得更好。都是为了大家好！”
                                    （北大荒）
    跟着毛主席走就有好日子过
    去年九月初，人民政府号召卖余粮的消息，传到了湖南省新化县十一区大新乡青岗山。在这里住着的欧观稻老汉马上召开了个家庭会议，算了一下细账，决定把一千多斤余粮全部卖给国家。
    欧观稻已经五十四岁了，大儿子欧林元一九五○年参加了志愿军，二儿子在县里的中学念书，他成了家中的主要劳动力。他家里种着五亩多地，其中三亩九分都是下地，常年总产量都在一千九百斤上下。去年，由于他改进耕作技术和辛勤劳动，秋天，获得了山区少见的大丰收，仅四亩多地，就收了干谷三千一百一十八斤，平均每亩产量是六百八十八斤多。谷子收下来后，他就积极准备缴爱国公粮，把好的挑选出来，晒了三天，又分类储存起来，等着缴公粮的日期。日期到了，他就把分类储存起来的桃源禾、胜利籼、万利籼三种谷子都拿出来，让验收员挑选。送粮的前两天，他的脚叫石头碰伤了，不能亲自送粮，就动员自己的妻子和儿媳妇去送，按时把公粮送到了目的地。
    欧观稻很知道自己的好日子是怎么得来的，因此人民政府号召卖余粮时，又把自己的余粮卖给国家。他说：“我一辈子也忘不了毛主席对农民的关心，跟着他老人家走就有好日子过！”
                                  （熊大水）
