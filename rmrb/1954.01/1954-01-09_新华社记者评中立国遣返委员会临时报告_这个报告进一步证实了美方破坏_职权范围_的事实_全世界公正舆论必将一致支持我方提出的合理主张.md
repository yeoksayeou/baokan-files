Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 8th Dispatch from our Special Correspondent: The Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) submitted to both parties of the Korean Armistice Agreement explains to the world the affirmative facts of the U.S. side undermining the relevant prisoner of war (POW) repatriation agreement and interpretation work, further confirming that the U.S. side bears inescapable responsibility for the current serious situation caused by the POW issue.

Based on the NNRC's nearly four months of efforts and work experience, the "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" is able to point out more fairly the series of facts that the United Nations Command (UNC) side, through its deployed special agent organizations, continues to control the NNRC custody camps, undermine the interpretation work, and obstruct the repatriation of POWs by violence, making it impossible to implement the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulated in the armistice agreement. The report also states that the NNRC believes that both parties to the Korean Armistice should have the right to conduct ninety days of interpretation work. The report also states that, since the political conference has not yet been realized, the commission requests both parties to give serious consideration to the entire POW handling issue in accordance with the basic objectives of the "scope of authority."

The facts listed in the interim report once again expose the U.S. side's planned crimes of undermining the "scope of authority" and conspiring to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese captured personnel. The report points out that even before the POWs were handed over to the NNRC, the U.S. side had deployed "a very complex and complete" special agent organization among the Korean and Chinese POWs, and the main purpose of this organization was to prevent the repatriation of POWs. In order to facilitate the control of special agents and create disturbances, the U.S. side highly concentrated the POW camps it built in a small area, creating "very serious obstacles" for the Indian Custodial Forces in their custodial work. After the POWs were handed over, the U.S. side maintained contact with the special agent organization through various illegal means, controlling the entire POW camp. The "headquarters of the special agent organization is located in Seoul and is controlled by the Commander-in-Chief of the Republic of Korea Military Police. This headquarters is connected to four branch organizations that control six POW enclosure areas. The branch organizations control the camp organizations in all fifty-five camps. An effective communication system is at work between these three levels of organization, with the United Nations Command 64th Field Hospital constituting the most important link in this communication system." The special agent organization, which was pre-arranged and continues to be directed by the U.S. side, continued the consistent reign of terror in the U.S. side in the Dongchang-ri camp. The methods used by the special agent organization "are coercive. Acts of violence have been used against those willing to exercise their right to repatriation." "Several murders have occurred." "No prisoner of war in the Dongchang-ri POW camp dares to publicly request repatriation." "Those prisoners of war who are willing to be repatriated are forcibly detained in the POW camp under duress, and they cannot exercise their right to repatriation in their POW camp." "Any prisoner of war willing to be repatriated has to do so secretly at the risk of his life."

Undermining the interpretation work for the Korean and Chinese side is a major part of the U.S. side's conspiracy to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese POWs. The report points out that before handing over the POWs, the U.S. side not only failed to ensure that all POWs correctly understood the terms of the "scope of authority" in accordance with the clear provisions of the "scope of authority," but instead distorted the "scope of authority" to the POWs, claiming that the POWs did not have to attend the interpretation, with the intention of undermining the interpretation work for the Korean and Chinese side. When the NNRC formulated the "Detailed Rules for Interpretation and Visitation Work" in accordance with the provisions of the "scope of authority," the U.S. side openly proposed that POWs could individually or collectively refuse to listen to the interpretation without any sanctions, ostensibly preparing in advance for the special agents to prevent the POWs from listening to the interpretation. In a letter to the NNRC, UNC Commander Clark openly requested the NNRC to conduct illegal screening to replace the interpretation work stipulated in the "scope of authority." The report correctly points out that the interpretation work is a mandatory provision of the "scope of authority," and the commission must provide the interpretation representatives with the necessary freedom and convenience in accordance with the "scope of authority," and the interpretation work must not be replaced by the procedure suggested by Clark.

The report also narrates the factual process of the U.S. side repeatedly undermining the interpretation work for the Korean and Chinese side. The U.S. side fabricated various excuses and openly deceived the NNRC to delay the construction of interpretation facilities, delaying the interpretation work for the Korean and Chinese side by twenty days. The U.S. side instructed its special agents not to allow the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to listen to the interpretation, and not to allow the NNRC to implement the regulations for isolating the POWs who have listened to the interpretation from those who have not, causing the interpretation work for the Korean and Chinese side to be interrupted repeatedly. The report points out that the special agent organization's prevention of POWs from leaving the camp to listen to the interpretation "is related to the hostile attitude taken by certain relevant parties outside the POW camp towards the interpretation at that time"; the so-called relevant parties are the former detaining party mentioned in the report, as well as the so-called "Embassy in South Korea" of Syngman Rhee, Won Yong-duk, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. The report also points out that the special agents' prevention of POWs from implementing the isolation regulations is due to "their clearly stated fear that dispersing the POW camp would lead to the disintegration of the organization within the camp, thereby weakening the influence of these 'representatives' on the majority of POWs." Under the sabotage of the U.S. side and its special agents, the interpretation work for the Korean and Chinese side only lasted for ten days. Even in these mere ten days of interpretation, the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side who listened to the interpretation were still under the control and threat of the U.S. special agents. The report points out that the NNRC "saw that the behavior of the POWs in the interpretation tents had a consistent type... shouting the same slogans in the same language," obviously the POWs had to act according to their arrangements in the interpretation camp under the terrorist threat of the special agents. The report also illustrates with concrete examples that even in the interpretation tent, the POWs "were filled with such fear that although they longed to go home, they could not get rid of those fears."

Based on the above facts, the report concludes that among the Korean and Chinese POWs under the custody of the NNRC, it has not been possible to remove the control and influence of the original detaining party, i.e., the U.S. side. The activities of the U.S. side and its special agent organization have weakened the custody and control of the NNRC, making it impossible for the vast majority of POWs to listen to the interpretation at all, and preventing the POWs from exercising their right to repatriation. The Korean and Chinese POWs not only "did not enjoy the freedom to seek repatriation in the camp and were under the threat of force or violence," but even in individual interpretations, they could not be free from "the force or threat of violence from the POW camp organization and its leaders, which are closely related to the POW camp organization and its leaders." This fully shows how seriously the "scope of authority" has been undermined by the U.S. side.

The conclusion in the report regarding the situation in the Dongchang-ri camp and the description of the situation in the Songgok-ri camp form a sharp contrast. The report points out that in the Songgok-ri U.S. POW camp, "there is no evidence sufficient to prove that the original detaining party has any activities in the camp," and "there is no evidence to show the existence of any organization." The report also points out that the "interpretation work in the Songgok-ri POW camp is significantly free from any harassment and there is no manifestation of violence." This sharp contrast is a reflection of the two completely different attitudes of the Korean and Chinese side strictly abiding by the agreement and the U.S. side deliberately undermining the agreement.

The interim report also narrates the factual process of the NNRC itself failing to take resolute measures to maintain and implement the "scope of authority." In the early stage of its work, the commission formulated the "Detailed Rules for Interpretation and Visitation Work" in accordance with the "scope of authority," and the commission also stated in the communique the situation that the Dongchang-ri camp was controlled by the violent acts of the special agent organization. However, the commission did not take any practical measures to strictly implement the "scope of authority" and the "working rules" it had adopted, and improve the situation in the POW camp where special agents were rampant. Although the Korean and Chinese side and the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the NNRC have repeatedly pointed out that if the NNRC does not take effective measures to disband the special agent organization and isolate the special agent elements, it will be unable to fulfill its duties. However, the Swedish and Swiss members of the commission opposed disbanding the special agent organization that ruled the POWs by violence and obstructed repatriation, on the pretext of the so-called "in accordance with the general spirit of the Geneva Convention, POWs should be allowed to remain in their organized groups." Although the Indian delegation of the commission admitted the necessity of isolating the special agents, it delayed taking practical action on the grounds of so-called "practical difficulties" and insufficient troops. When the Korean and Chinese side and the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the NNRC repeatedly requested that effective measures be taken and force be used when necessary to stop the special agents from undermining the interpretation work, the commission also unanimously passed the decision that the soldiers of the Indian Custodial Forces should enter the POW camp tents to bring out the POWs to listen to the interpretation, and resolved that the Indian Custodial Forces could use weapons when attacked and when attempts to escape collectively were discovered. However, when the Indian Custodial Forces were supposed to specifically implement this decision, the Swedish and Swiss members distorted the "scope of authority" and the Geneva Convention, and reversed right and wrong to say that the issue was "the use of force against POWs," opposing the use of necessary coercive measures to stop the sabotage activities of the special agents. The Swiss member even threatened to withdraw from the commission, while the Indian delegation, on the one hand, admitted that Article 7 of the "scope of authority" "clearly stipulates that such force can be used in order to perform the duties and responsibilities of this commission," but on the other hand, it actually still adopted a wait-and-see attitude on the grounds that it might "cause significant casualties" and that the commission's unanimous support was needed. Disregarding the resolute opposition of the Czechoslovak and Polish members, the commission not only did not take effective measures to disband the special agent organization and stop the special agent activities, but instead relied on the special agents to carry out all the work, and claimed that the commission was the "supreme authority" that approved the interpretation plan of the Korean and Chinese side, and that it could decide whether to approve the interpretation plan of the Korean and Chinese side based on the standard of so-called "whether it works." As a result, the interpretation plan of the Korean and Chinese side would not work as long as the special agents did not agree, and therefore could not be realized. The supreme authority that approved the interpretation plan proposed by the Korean and Chinese side was actually not the NNRC but the special agents of the UNC who were planning to undermine the interpretation work.

As narrated in the report, the Korean and Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out that the "scope of authority" clearly stipulates that the NNRC has the responsibility to ensure that the repatriation of POWs is not obstructed by force or threat of violence, to ensure that the country to which the POWs belong has the freedom and convenience to continuously conduct ninety days of interpretation to the POWs, so that all POWs have the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation. The NNRC has full power and obligation to take necessary coercive measures to disband the U.S. side's special agent organization. Opposing the NNRC's exercise of its power to use coercive measures against the special agents is intentionally protecting the special agents' violent threat and reign of terror over the POWs, preventing the POWs from having the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation. Precisely because the "scope of authority" and the Geneva Convention both stipulate that violence must not be inflicted on POWs, the failure to take coercive measures against organizations that rule POWs by violence is a serious violation of the "scope of authority" and the Geneva Convention. It can be seen from this that although the serious situation on the POW issue was created by the U.S. side single-handedly, the NNRC conducted its work under the sabotage, threat, and difficulties imposed by the U.S. side and its special agents. Nevertheless, the commission cannot escape a certain degree of responsibility because it failed to resolutely resist external interference and fulfill its solemn responsibilities.

Although the interim report is basically consistent with the facts, it also has its own defects. As pointed out by the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the committee who drafted the report in their statement of agreement with the report, the report lacks "logical consistency" in describing the reasons for the undesirable situation in the POW camp, "is presented in a very vague way," and "does not make it clear enough that the unfortunate situation existing in the POW camp south of the demilitarized zone is the result of pre-arranged and planned activities by the original detaining party, i.e., the UNC." However, even with the incomplete factual situation listed in the report, it is fully clear that under the planned obstruction, sabotage, and threat of the UNC, the NNRC failed to resolutely implement the provisions of the "scope of authority," thereby causing the current serious situation in which the "scope of authority" has not been realized.

The "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" has irrevocably established the fact that the UNC side has undermined the interpretation work and the "scope of authority." The Korean and Chinese side has consistently insisted on faithfully and strictly implementing the "scope of authority" in order to seek a fair resolution of the POW issue. Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai have solemnly pointed out that the NNRC must immediately restore the interpretation work, eliminate the U.S. side's special agents, break up the U.S. side's special agent organization, make up for the ninety days of interpretation time for the Korean and Chinese side, and ensure that every POW has the opportunity to exercise his right to repatriation; the issue of the handling of the remaining POWs must be discussed and resolved by the political conference within thirty days. Based on an unbiased understanding of the facts, fair-minded public opinion throughout the world will unanimously support the reasonable and just claims of the Korean and Chinese side and oppose adopting a compromising attitude towards the U.S. side's conspiracy to forcibly detain POWs.

    新华社记者评中立国遣返委员会临时报告
    这个报告进一步证实了美方破坏“职权范围”的事实
    全世界公正舆论必将一致支持我方提出的合理主张
    【新华社开城八日电】　本社特派记者报道：中立国遣返委员会提交朝鲜停战缔约双方的关于委员会工作的临时报告，向全世界说明了美方破坏有关战俘遣返协议和解释工作的肯定事实，进一步证实了美方对于目前由于战俘问题而引起的严重局势负有无可逃避的责任。
    “中立国遣返委员会临时报告”根据委员会将近四个月来的努力和工作经验，因而能够比较公正地指出了联合国军方面通过它所布置的特务组织继续控制中立国看管营场、破坏解释工作、以暴力阻挠战俘遣返，使停战协定的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”无法实施的一系列事实。报告同时说明：中立国遣返委员会认为朝鲜停战双方应有权进行九十天的解释工作。报告并声称：由于政治会议尚未实现，委员会要求双方根据“职权范围”的基本目标对整个战俘处理问题予以认真的考虑。
    临时报告列举的事实又一次揭发了美方有计划地破坏“职权范围”、阴谋强迫扣留朝中被俘人员的罪行。报告指出：早在战俘移交中立国遣返委员会之前，美方就在朝中被俘人员中布置了“甚为复杂而完整”的特务组织，这组织的主要目的就在于阻止战俘的遣返。为了便于特务控制和制造骚动，美方并把它所修建的战俘营场高度地集中在一小块地方，造成了印度看管部队在看管工作中的
  “很严重的障碍”。战俘移交以后，美方更通过各种非法途径保持与特务组织的联系，控制了整个战俘营。特务组织的“总部地点在汉城，受大韩民国宪兵总司令官的控制。这一总部与控制六个战俘围场的四个分支组织是相联系的。分支组织则控制着所有五十五个营场中的营场组织。在这三层组织之间有一个有效的通讯系统在工作，联合国军第六十四野战医院在这一通讯系统中构成了最重要的一环”。美方所事先布置并继续指挥的特务组织，在东场里营地继续维持了美方所一贯进行的恐怖统治。特务组织“所使用的方法是强迫性的。暴力行为曾施用于那些愿意行使遣返权利的人”。“若干次凶杀事件曾经发生”。东场里战俘营中“没有一个战俘敢于公开要求遣返”。“那些愿意遣返的战俘是受有胁迫而强行拘留在战俘营里的，而在他们的战俘营里是不能行使其遣返权利的”。“任何愿意遣返的战俘都不得不秘密地冒着生命的危险去这样做”。
    破坏朝中方面的解释工作是美方强迫扣留朝中被俘人员的阴谋中的主要一项。报告指出，美方在移交战俘之前，不但并未按照“职权范围”的明确规定使全部战俘正确地了解“职权范围”的条款，而且相反地向战俘曲解“职权范围”，声称战俘不必出席解释，预谋破坏朝中方面的解释工作。当中立国遣返委员会按照“职权范围”的规定制定“解释和访问工作细则”时，美方更公开提出战俘得个别地或集体地拒绝听取解释而不受任何制裁，俨然为特务阻止战俘听取解释预作准备。联合国军总司令克拉克在致中立国遣返委员会函中，公开要求由中立国遣返委员会非法进行甄别以代替“职权范围”所规定的解释工作。报告中正确地指出解释工作是“职权范围”的强制性的规定，委员会必须根据“职权范围”向解释代表提供必要的自由与便利，解释工作决不能为克拉克所建议的程序所代替。
    报告中也叙述了美方一再破坏朝中方面解释工作的事实经过。美方捏造各种借口，公然诳骗中立国遣返委员会以拖延解释设备的修建，使朝中方面的解释工作推迟了二十天。美方指使其特务不让朝鲜人民军的被俘人员听取解释，不让中立国遣返委员会实行隔离已听解释与未听解释的战俘的规定，使朝中方面的解释工作再三陷于中断。报告指出，特务组织不让战俘出营场听取解释，“是与那时在战俘营外的某些有关方面对解释所采取的敌对态度有关系的”；所谓有关方面，就是报告中所提到的前拘留一方以及李承晚、元容德和蒋匪的所谓“驻南朝鲜大使馆”。报告中并指出，特务不让战俘实行隔离的规定，是由于“他们明白申述的恐惧，即打散战俘营就会导致营内组织的涣散，并从而削弱这些‘代表’对大部战俘所施行的影响”。在美方及其特务的破坏下，朝中方面的解释工作仅仅进行了十天。就在这仅仅十天的解释中，听取解释的朝中被俘人员仍然处于美方特务的控制和威胁之下。报告指出，中立国遣返委员会“看到了战俘在解释帐篷里的行为具有一致的类型……用同样的语言喊同样的口号”，显然战俘是在特务的恐怖威胁之下不得不按其布置在解释营场中行事的。报告中并以具体的例证，说明了即使在解释帐篷内，战俘“心中灌注了这样的恐惧，以致虽然渴望回家但又不能摆脱那些恐惧”。
    根据上述各项事实，报告在结论中指出，在中立国遣返委员会看管下的朝中被俘人员中，并没有能够解除原拘留一方即美方的控制和影响。美方及其特务组织的活动削弱了中立国遣返委员会的看管和控制，使绝大部分的战俘根本未能听取解释，使战俘不能行使其遣返权利。朝中被俘人员不但“在营场中时均未享有寻求遣返的自由，并处于武力或武力威胁之下”，而且甚至在个别解释中，也不能免于“来自战俘营组织与其领导的、并与战俘营组织与其领导有密切联系的武力或武力威胁”。这充分地说明“职权范围”已遭受到了美方多么严重的破坏。
    报告中关于东场里营地情况的结论和关于松谷里营地情况的叙述，形成了鲜明的对照。报告指出，在松谷里美方战俘营地“并无证据足以证明原拘留一方对于营中战俘有任何活动”，“未有任何证据，可以显示任何组织的存在”。报告中并指出，松谷里战俘营的“解释工作显著地不受任何骚扰且没有任何暴力的表现”。这一鲜明的对照，是朝中方面严格遵守协定与美方蓄意破坏协定的两种截然不同的态度的反映。
    临时报告也叙述了中立国遣返委员会本身未能采取坚决措施维护与实施“职权范围”的事实经过。委员会在其工作的初期，曾经根据“职权范围”制订“解释和访问工作细则”，委员会并曾在公报中说明东场里营地为特务组织的暴力行为所控制的情况。但委员会并没有采取任何实际措施严格执行“职权范围”和它所通过的“工作细则”，改善战俘营中特务横行的情况。虽然朝中方面和中立国遣返委员会的捷克斯洛伐克委员、波兰委员都曾一再指出，如果中立国遣返委员会不采取有效措施打散特务组织，隔离特务分子，则将会无法履行其职责。但委员会的瑞典、瑞士委员竟借口所谓“按照日内瓦公约总的精神，战俘应被允许仍在其有组织的团体中”，反对打散以暴力统治战俘、阻挠遣返的特务组织。委员会的印度代表团虽然承认有必要隔离特务，但又以所谓“实际的困难”、兵力不足等为理由，延不采取实际行动。当朝中方面和中立国遣返委员会的捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员又一再要求采取有效措施、必要时使用武力以制止特务破坏解释工作的活动时，委员会也曾一致通过印度看管部队的士兵进入战俘营场帐篷带出战俘听取解释的决定，并决议印度看管部队在遭到袭击和发现有集体逃跑的企图时可以使用武器。但在印度看管部队应具体执行这一决定时，瑞典、瑞士委员竟又曲解“职权范围”和日内瓦公约，颠倒是非地将问题说成是“对战俘使用武力”，反对以必要的强制手段制止特务的破坏活动。瑞士委员甚至以退出委员会相威胁，而印度代表团却又一面承认“职权范围”第七款“明白规定，为了履行本委员会的职务与责任，此类武力是可以使用的”，但另一方面又以可能“造成重大伤亡”，需要委员会一致支持等为理由，实际上仍然采取了坐视的态度。委员会不顾捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员的坚决反对，不但没有采取有效措施打散特务组织，制止特务活动，却相反地依赖特务进行一切工作，并且声称委员会是批准朝中方面解释计划的“最高权力机关”，它可以根据所谓“是否行得通”的标准来决定是否批准朝中方面的解释计划。结果是朝中方面的解释计划只要特务不同意就是行不通，因而不能实现。只有在特务把一切安排妥当，自认为可以控制一个营场的每一个战俘时，朝中方面的解释工作才能进行。批准朝中方面所提解释计划的最高权力机关，实际上并不是中立国遣返委员会而是那些有计划破坏解释工作的联合国军方面的特务。
    正如报告中所叙述的，朝中方面曾经一再指出：“职权范围”明确规定，中立国遣返委员会负有责任保证战俘之遣返不受武力或武力威胁的阻挠，保证战俘所属国家有自由与便利不间断地向战俘进行九十天的解释，从而使全部战俘有行使其遣返权利的机会。中立国遣返委员会有完全的权力和义务采取必要的强制手段打散美方的特务组织。反对中立国遣返委员会对特务行使其使用强制手段的权力，乃是有意保护特务分子对于战俘的暴力威胁和恐怖统治，使战俘得不到行使其遣返权利的机会。正因为“职权范围”和日内瓦公约都规定了不得对战俘施行暴力，对于以暴力统治战俘的组织拒不采取强制手段，加以制裁，乃是对于“职权范围”和日内瓦公约的严重的破坏。由此可见，战俘问题上的严重局面虽然是美方一手造成的，中立国遣返委员会在美方及其特务的破坏、威胁之下进行工作，虽然有一定的困难，但是委员会未能坚决抗拒外界干涉，履行其庄严的职责，因此也不能不负有一定的责任。
    临时报告虽然基本上是符合事实的，但也存有着其本身的缺陷。正如草拟这一报告的委员会中捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员在同意这一报告的声明中所指出的，报告在叙述产生战俘营中不合人意的情况的原因时“逻辑的一致性不够”，“是以一种很模糊的方式提出的”，“没有足够清楚地说明目前非军事区南部战俘营中存在的不幸情况是原拘留方即联合国军方面预先安排好的有计划的活动的结果”。但即以报告中所列举的不完全的事实情况，也就充分地说明了中立国遣返委员会在联合国军方面有计划的阻挠、破坏和威胁之下，未能坚决执行“职权范围”的规定，从而造成了“职权范围”未能实现的目前的严重情况。
    “中立国遣返委员会临时报告”已经不可动摇地确立了联合国军方面破坏解释工作、破坏“职权范围”的事实。朝中方面一贯坚持必须忠实而严格地执行“职权范围”以求得战俘问题的公正解决。金日成元帅和彭德怀将军已经严正指出：中立国遣返委员会必须立即恢复解释工作、清除美方特务、打破美方特务组织，补足朝中方面九十天的解释时间，保证每一战俘都有行使其遣返权利的机会；剩余战俘的处理问题必须交由政治会议在三十天内讨论与解决。全世界的公正舆论基于对事实的毫无偏见的了解，必将一致支持朝中方面的合理的与正义的主张，反对对美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋采取让步态度。
