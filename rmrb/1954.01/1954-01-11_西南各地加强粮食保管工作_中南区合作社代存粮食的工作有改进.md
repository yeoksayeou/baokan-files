    Southwest China Strengthens Grain Storage
    Improvements in Grain Storage by Cooperatives in Central South China
    The autumn grain tax collection and storage work in the Southwest region has basically concluded, and purchased grain is being stored in large quantities. Various areas in Southwest China are actively strengthening grain storage work.
    Before the autumn grain was stored, grain depots in various parts of Southwest China generally carried out cleaning and disinfection work. Many grain depots also repaired cracks and rat holes, cleared ditches around the warehouses, and sun-dried the tools for packaging grain and storage equipment. To solve the problem of insufficient storage capacity, many areas built simple storage warehouses or rented vacant warehouses from the masses. Many regions have carried out reasonable consolidation of warehouses and focused on promoting quota management. Chongqing Grain Company implemented quota management, improved grain stacking methods, and improved grain packaging, enabling it to store 25 million to 28 million catties more grain than in the past. After Kunming Grain Company's Yangsi Warehouse implemented quota management, its storage capacity increased by 15.9 percent.
    The Southwest Grain Administration, the Sichuan Provincial People's Government, and the Guizhou Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau have recently made arrangements for winter grain storage work. They require cadres at all levels of the grain department to recognize that grain storage is an important link in the country's economic construction, overcome the complacent thinking that "grain will not spoil in cold weather," and establish and improve regular inspection systems. They must vigorously carry out tasks such as conducting queue inspections after grain is stored, sorting and organizing, and killing overwintering storage insects. The Ludu County Grain Bureau in Sichuan Province and others recently held a meeting of warehouse keepers, combined with the study of the general line of the country's transition period, criticized the ideas of some cadres who did not pay attention to storage work, and specifically studied ways to strengthen storage.
    State-owned grain departments and cooperatives in Central South China have recently jointly studied and improved the grain storage work of cooperatives, reducing the rate of grain storage losses.
    Since 1952, when grain departments in various parts of Central South China entrusted cooperatives to purchase and store grain on their behalf, many cooperatives often experienced phenomena such as mildew and insect infestation in the grain they stored, due to unclear responsibilities between the two parties and the cooperatives' lack of experience in grain storage. Not long ago, the heads of the grain bureaus and managers of grain companies of various provinces and cities in Central South China and the responsible persons of the cooperatives held a joint meeting to jointly study the grain storage problem of the cooperatives. The meeting stipulated that when cooperatives purchase grain, they should transport it as they purchase it as much as possible, according to the transportation capacity of the masses and the warehouse conditions of the grain bureau, in order to reduce the amount of grain stored by the cooperatives and shorten the storage time. The grain warehouses of cooperatives should generally be based on the principles of convenient transportation, large capacity, and easy management. The two parties should not blindly entrust or blindly accept storage tasks. When the grain department entrusts the cooperative to store grain on its behalf, the two parties should negotiate a specific storage contract, clearly stipulate the storage responsibilities, and determine the quantity, time, and location of the storage based on the use of the stored grain and the warehouse conditions. The meeting also made specific provisions on storage and warehousing systems, inspection systems, measurement and reporting systems, and so on.
    After the meeting, grain departments and cooperatives in various parts of Central South China studied and improved the grain storage work of the cooperatives. The relationship between the two parties has been further improved. Under the specific help of cadres working in the grain department, many cooperative cadres have learned to check grain temperature and use simple grain storage technologies such as rice thermometers, powder sprayers, and moisture meters. They have also generally understood the basic knowledge of grain storage. Therefore, the loss rate of grain stored by many cooperatives has been greatly reduced. For example, the loss rate of grain stored by the Luzidian Xiji Cooperative in Huangpi County, Hubei Province, was 3.7 percent in 1952, but it has now gradually decreased to 0.42 percent.

    西南各地加强粮食保管工作
    中南区合作社代存粮食的工作有改进
    西南区农业税秋征入库工作已经基本结束，收购的粮食正在大量入仓，西南各地正积极加强粮食保管工作。
    在秋粮入库以前，西南各地粮库一般都进行了清仓消毒工作。许多粮库还修补了裂缝和鼠洞，疏通了仓库周围的水沟，对包装粮食的用具和仓储器材等进行了曝晒。为了解决仓容不足的问题，许多地区修建了简易收纳仓库，或向群众租借空闲的仓房。许多地区进行了合理并仓、重点推行定额管理等工作。重庆市粮食公司实行定额管理，改进粮食堆码方法，改善粮食包装后，比过去能多储存二千五百万斤到二千八百万斤粮食；昆明市粮食公司杨泗仓库实行定额管理后，仓库容量扩大了百分之十五点九。
    西南粮食管理局、四川省人民政府、贵州省人民政府粮食厅等最近都对冬季粮食保管工作作了布置，要求各级粮食部门的干部认清粮食保管工作是国家经济建设中的一个重要环节，克服“天气冷不会坏粮食”等麻痹思想，建立和健全定期检查等制度，大力作好粮食入库后进行排队检查，分类整理，捕杀越冬仓虫等项工作。四川省?都县粮食局等日前召开保管员会议，结合学习国家过渡时期的总路线，批判了部分干部不重视保管工作的思想，具体研究了加强保管的办法。
    中南区国营粮食部门和合作社最近共同研究改进了合作社代存粮食的保管工作，降低了粮食保管的损耗率。
    中南区各地粮食部门自一九五二年委托合作社代购代存粮食以来，因为双方责任不够明确和合作社保管粮食的经验不足，不少合作社代存的粮食常常发生霉烂、生虫等现象。中南区各省、市粮食厅厅长、粮食公司经理和合作社负责人不久以前举行联席会议，共同研究了合作社代存粮食的保管问题。会议规定：合作社收购粮食时，应根据群众运输力量和粮食局的仓库条件，尽量随购随运，以减少合作社代存粮食的数量和缩短代存的时间。合作社的粮食仓库一般应以运输便利、容量大、易于管理为原则。双方不盲目委托和盲目接受代存任务。粮食部门委托合作社代存粮食时，双方应商订具体的保管合同，明确规定保管责任，根据代存粮食的用途和仓库条件确定代存的数量、时间和地点等。会议对保管和出入仓制度、检查制度、测报与报告制度等，也都作了具体的规定。
    会后，中南各地粮食部门和合作社都研究改进了合作社代存粮食的保管工作。双方关系有了进一步的改善；许多合作社干部在粮食部门工作干部的具体帮助下，已学会检查粮食温度和使用简单的米温计、喷粉器、水分测定器等粮食保管技术，一般也都懂得了保管粮食的基本常识。因此，许多合作社代存粮食的损耗率大为降低。如湖北省黄陂县陆子店新集合作社一九五二年代存粮食的损耗率达百分之三点七，现在已逐步降低到百分之零点四二。
