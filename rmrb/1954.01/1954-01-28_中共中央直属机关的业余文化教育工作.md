The Amateur Cultural Education Work of Organs Directly Under the CPC Central Committee
By the Office of the Working Committee of the Organs Directly Under the CPC Central Committee

The amateur cultural supplementary education work of the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee has gradually expanded over the past four or five years due to the attention of the leading comrades of various organs, developing from scattered cultural classes and literacy classes to amateur cultural supplementary schools for organs.

The main achievements of the cultural supplementary education work in recent years are:

I. It has improved the cultural level of cadres and general staff of the organs, enabling everyone to work with peace of mind, delve into their work, thereby improving their work ability and ideological and political level.

In recent years, we have gradually organized almost all personnel within the organs who could participate in political theory study and cultural study. And raised the cultural level of most worker-peasant cadres in the organs to the junior high school level. According to the statistics of the summer of 1953, junior high school students, excluding graduates, have reached 51.17% of the total number of students (in the second semester of 1951, junior high school students only accounted for 36.4% of the total number of students).

II. It has prepared better conditions for theoretical study in the organs (the Central Committee of the CPC stipulated that only those with a cultural level equivalent to junior high school graduation can participate in theoretical study).

III. It has gradually accumulated experience in running amateur cultural supplementary schools for organs, formulated a relatively standardized school system suitable for the situation of the organs, cultivated a group of full-time cadres and teachers engaged in cadre cultural education, and selected and compiled some teaching materials (elementary school, junior high school Chinese, elementary school arithmetic).

We have experienced that running a formal amateur cultural supplementary school for organs and persisting in it is an important part of the Party's political work in the organs. Improving the cultural level of the staff of the organs will be a regular task for a considerable period of time, which should not be regarded as dispensable or completed by crash programs, but must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner.

In recent years, we have had the following experiences in running amateur cultural supplementary schools for organs:

  Regarding the guiding principles and requirements for amateur cultural supplementary education in organs

What is the purpose of amateur cultural supplementary education in organs? We believe that it is to improve the cultural level of the comrades working in the organs to meet the needs of the work. Of course, this is not only for the needs of today's work, but also for the needs of tomorrow's work. The improvement of the cultural level of cadres can not only help cadres improve their professional ability, but also help cadres further improve their political and theoretical level.

Most of the middle and lower-level cadres and general staff of the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee are worker-peasant elements who participated in the land revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation. They have a certain political level under the long-term education of the Party, but their cultural level is not high, and many comrades are only beginning to read. They generally require cultural learning.

Based on the above-mentioned purposes and the specific conditions of the organs, we stipulate that the requirements for amateur cultural supplementary education in organs today should be to gradually raise the middle and lower-level cadres and the majority of the staff in the organs to a level equivalent to junior high school graduation as much as possible. The current amateur cultural supplementary schools are working according to this requirement. In the process of work, some comrades once thought that the requirements could be lowered. We believe that this idea is wrong because it cannot meet the requirements of the work, nor can it achieve the purpose of improving cadres. Some comrades also suggested that the goal should be to reach a level equivalent to high school graduation. We believe that it is not appropriate to put forward such a high requirement all at once, because the cultural level of the staff of the organs should be gradually improved. As far as the situation of our organs is concerned, when a small number of comrades reach the level of graduation from higher elementary school, they leave the organs and transfer to other schools to study when work conditions permit, and they can improve their cultural level in the schools; most of the comrades participate in theoretical study when they reach the level of junior high school graduation, and continue to gradually improve their cultural level in theoretical study. As for what method should be used to continue to improve the cultural level of comrades with a junior high school graduation level, it remains to be studied.

Our educational focus is first on today's cadres, second on general staff with development prospects and better learning conditions, that is, tomorrow's cadres; at the same time, we should also make it possible for all staff members of the organs to receive education.

Since the background, work situation, learning conditions, and learning requirements of the students are different, we have adopted the principle of "differentiating objects and treating them separately." According to this principle, we have set different education plans and teaching schedules.

Regarding the teaching policy of amateur cultural supplementary education in organs, we believe that Chairman Mao's policy of "quick, practical, but also formal" for cultural education in the army is completely applicable to our amateur cultural supplementary education for cadres in organs. Amateur cultural supplementary education in organs must be "quick" because most students already have a certain political level, and most are adults with generally high comprehension, and at the same time, because they are learning at work, time is limited, so it is necessary to seek quick results. In terms of teaching requirements, it should be both "quick" and "successful," with equal emphasis on quantity and quality. In terms of curriculum and teaching materials, it should be appropriately streamlined. In terms of teaching methods, quick methods should be adopted according to the characteristics and advantages of the students; of course, it is also wrong to only seek speed without paying attention to consolidation. Amateur cultural supplementary education in organs must be "practical" because the social common sense and life common sense of cadres in organs are relatively rich. Practical teaching is easy to teach and easy to understand, is popular with students, and can directly help work. Contacting reality is also a condition for achieving quick results. Amateur cultural supplementary education in organs must be "formal." We believe that the formalization of amateur cultural supplementary schools in organs mainly requires a certain school system, a certain organizational structure, the completion of the prescribed junior high school courses in a step-by-step and planned manner, the teaching must be planned and continuous, and the school must have various systems necessary to complete the teaching plan.

In the process of running amateur cultural supplementary schools for organs, we have encountered the problem of conflicts between work and study time for students in terms of ideology and practice. We solve this problem with "work must be done well, and learning must be learned well" as the basic slogan, that is, we first emphasize that work must be done well, and learning must not hinder work, but under the condition of doing work well, the administrative side should ensure the necessary spare time for students to study. If it is necessary to delay class time due to work, the leaders should allow them to make up the class during appropriate working hours. Students must also be emphasized to study well and to make good use of their study time. We believe that it is inappropriate for some comrades to juxtapose work and study.

  Regarding the leadership of amateur cultural supplementary schools for organs

The amateur cultural supplementary schools in our organs are led by Party organizations at all levels.

We have learned that the attention and specific leadership of the Party organizations and leading cadres at all levels to the amateur cultural supplementary education work in the organs is the key to running the amateur cultural supplementary schools in the organs well. Not only should the top-level leaders of the organs pay attention, but also the leaders at all levels should pay attention, and even whether the grassroots leaders pay attention has a significant impact on the students' learning. To achieve this, the most important thing is to require the Party organizations and leading cadres at all levels to recognize the significance and role of the amateur cultural supplementary education work in the organs. In our organs, the Party organizations and leading cadres at all levels attach importance to this work. In the branch work outline adopted by the Party Congress, organizing and leading the learning of all personnel in the organs is regarded as the first specific task. Everyone also seriously abides by this regulation.

Leadership's attention is also reflected in the fact that the Party organizations at all levels have assigned special personnel to be responsible for it and have stipulated certain working systems. The Central Committee of the CPC stipulates: "Cultural education work is a part of the Party branch education work, and the Party committees, general branches, and directly subordinate branches are responsible for leading this work"; stipulates that "each Party committee, general branch, and directly subordinate branch should set up a cultural education committee to specifically manage the cultural education affairs of the personnel of the organs"; stipulates that "each Party committee, general branch, and directly subordinate branch should regularly arrange, inspect, summarize, and report this work to the Party committee" (generally arrange, discuss, and summarize once every six months, and inspect in the middle).

Leadership's attention is also reflected in ensuring a certain amount of learning time for students (other activities should not occupy fixed class time as much as possible), and allocating a certain number of full-time cadres and full-time teachers as the backbone of teaching, assisting and improving part-time teachers, doing a good job in teaching, and solving necessary classrooms, teaching equipment, and other issues in a timely manner.

On the other hand, the cultural supplementary school itself should also actively obtain the Party organization's leadership, such as submitting plans, reports, and summaries to the leaders for review, seeking instructions, and reflecting situations and raising issues for resolution in a timely manner. Since the leaders of the organs cannot have a lot of time to pay attention to the work of the school, this approach of the cultural supplementary school is very important.

In addition to deciding on the guiding principles, principles, and plans for a certain period of time, the Central Committee of the CPC's leadership over the amateur cultural supplementary education work of the organs is handled by the Party Committee Office on a daily basis, and several comrades are assigned in the Education Group of the Office to specifically manage cultural education work, respectively studying teaching and educational administration matters. In guiding teaching, we form teaching research groups of teachers of the same subject and class from various supplementary schools (also divided into classes). Through the teaching research groups of each subject, we carry out the work of selecting and compiling teaching materials, writing outlines, studying and formulating the teaching purposes and requirements of each subject, studying teaching plans and specific lesson plans, and organizing teaching observations, etc. The work of educational administration is to collect and study various regulations and systems materials provisionally formulated by various units, organize and issue them for reference by various schools.

  Regarding the school system, curriculum, and time of amateur cultural supplementary schools for organs

The school system, curriculum, and time of amateur cultural supplementary schools for organs were separately formulated and implemented on a trial basis by various organs before the first semester of 1951. In September 1951, the Party Committee first formulated two unified trial school systems for the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee, and initially stipulated the unified school system, curriculum, and study time. After the first cultural education work conference of the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee in September 1952, a second reform was carried out, and we carried out another reform before August 1953. From the three school system reform works, we have obtained the following experiences and lessons:

First of all, we realize that the school system problem is a fundamental problem in running amateur cultural supplementary schools for organs, and it is also a very complex problem. The school system should embody the educational policy of amateur cultural supplementary schools and specifically reflect the characteristics of the organs, schools, and students; the school system is a concentrated expression of the mutual combination of major issues such as curriculum, time, classes, and homework, and it is also the central link in solving various contradictions of amateur cultural supplementary schools for organs.

Secondly, we believe that the following points should be paid attention to when formulating the school system:

I. Take care of the overall situation, mainly taking care of the following four aspects: 1. The work situation of the organs; 2. The actual situation of the students; 3. The actual situation of teaching; 4. The experiences and lessons learned from past school system reforms.

II. Make general provisions for semesters and academic years to facilitate the schools to arrange and summarize work in stages and grasp the regularity of school work. We have stipulated as follows: one year is divided into two semesters, which together constitute one academic year. Each semester is set at twenty-two weeks, and the actual class time is twenty weeks, and the other two weeks are used for preparing for the start of the school year and ending the semester. There is one winter and summer vacation each academic year, each set at one month. According to the actual situation of the organs, the winter vacation is generally in February (including the Spring Festival), and the summer vacation is generally in August. During each vacation, the school should summarize experience to improve work, and organize reviews or supplementary lessons among students.

III. According to the actual situation of the organs, adhere to the principle of "differentiating objects and treating them separately." Because the students in the organs are in a complex situation, there should be different treatments in terms of study time, curriculum, progress, and requirements. The students in the organs can be roughly divided into three types: cadres, general staff with better learning conditions, and general staff with poor learning conditions. The school system should start from taking care of the majority (types one and two), and at the same time, it must take care of a small number of students with poor learning conditions.

IV. Correctly estimating and mastering time is the central link in formulating the school system. Because the time problem is the focus of the contradiction between work, study, and leisure activities in the organs, and solving the time problem is the key to solving the contradiction. According to past experience, the following three aspects should be correctly grasped in the time problem:

   (1) Under the condition of ensuring work, appropriately allocate the time for study, Party and League activities, and rest. The school system should start from the possible study time other than ensuring work and taking care of rest time to solve the contradiction between students' study, work, and rest.

   (2) In the total study time, the class time and review homework time should be appropriately allocated, and study how to combine them in concrete methods. It is inappropriate to only set the class time without formally stipulating the review homework time. After the homework time is appropriately stipulated, it should be strictly controlled, and teachers cannot arbitrarily increase or decrease it.

   (3) Correctly estimate the actual teaching time required for various courses, and the principle should be that the vast majority of students can accept it and take care of the fact that a small number of students can catch up. When there is a possibility of reducing teaching time due to the improvement of teaching methods, the principle of steady progress should also be observed.

V. On the issue of required courses: Since the students in the amateur cultural supplementary schools for organs have limited study time, and the entire study period cannot be dragged on for too long, the number of required courses cannot be set too much. According to the situation of the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee, it is appropriate to study courses such as Chinese, arithmetic, algebra, geography, and history. Other natural science courses are also necessary for students, but due to time constraints, it is not suitable to universally open classes for teaching. The Party Committee has decided to conduct teaching through lectures on a trial basis in the future. However, each unit can also open classes for teaching if it has conditions in terms of time and teachers.

At the same time, it is necessary to clearly stipulate the requirements for the teaching of each subject. According to the situation of our organs, the Chinese class should be the basic course among all subjects; the focus of the geography class should be on the geography of our country and world political geography; the focus of the history class should be on modern Chinese history and modern world history; the requirements for algebra teaching should also be appropriately lowered compared to the teaching requirements of ordinary middle schools.

VI. When formulating the school system, various courses should be arranged reasonably, and in general, the following three principles should be paid attention to:

   (1) Appropriately concentrate on learning one or two courses per semester in order to concentrate efforts and proceed step by step.

   (2) In the primary school stage, it is best to first study Chinese in a single subject, and then study other courses on the basis of consistently maintaining a higher level of Chinese. In this way, on the one hand, it can meet the students' urgent need for Chinese, and on the other hand, a high level of Chinese is more conducive to the quick completion of other courses. Teaching to eliminate illiteracy should be a separate stage (because the required study time is very inconsistent). The arithmetic course should be a straight line upward, without repeated cycles; the junior high school arithmetic part can be learned together with the elementary school arithmetic part, so that algebra can be learned as soon as entering junior high school.

   (3) Take care of the objective connection of each subject. Chinese should be studied continuously from beginning to end, arithmetic should be connected to the study of algebra, and should not be disconnected. A higher level of Chinese is needed to learn geography and history well. The study of history can be arranged at the end to connect with theoretical study.

VII. Since the work situation, study time, learning ability, and existing cultural level of the students are different, it is not possible to implement the same school system in one organ. According to past experience, we have stipulated three school systems, and we require each organ to flexibly grasp which school system or several school systems should be adopted according to the specific situation.

　　中共中央直属机关的业余文化教育工作
    中国共产党中央直属机关委员会办公室
    中共中央直属机关的业余文化补习教育工作，由于各机关领导同志的重视，四、五年来逐步扩大，由分散的文化班、识字班逐渐发展为机关业余文化补习学校。
    几年来，文化补习教育工作的主要收获是：
    一、提高了机关干部和一般工作人员的文化程度，使大家能够安心工作，钻研业务，从而提高了工作能力和思想政治水平。
    几年来，我们已经逐步地把机关内可能参加政治理论学习和文化学习的人员，基本上全部组织起来。并把机关中大部分工农干部的文化水平提高到初中程度。根据一九五三年暑期的统计，初中学员除毕业者外，已达到全体学员人数百分之五十一点一七（一九五一年下学期初中学员只占全体学员的百分之三十六点四）。
    二、为机关理论学习准备了较好的条件（中直党委规定：必须具有初中毕业的文化程度始得参加理论学习）。
    三、逐步积累了办理机关业余文化补习学校的经验，制定了一套比较正规而又适合机关情况的学制，培养了一批作干部文化教育工作的专职干部和教员，选编了部分教材（小学、初中语文、小学算术）。
    我们体验到：办理正规的机关业余文化补习学校，并坚持下去，是机关中党的政治工作的重要部分。提高机关工作人员的文化水平，在相当长的时间内，还是一个经常的工作，不能看成可有可无的事情，也不可限期突击完成，必须有计划有步骤地坚持进行。
    几年来，我们办理机关业余文化补习学校，有以下一些经验：
      关于机关业余文化补习教育的方针和要求问题
    机关业余文化补习教育的目的是什么？我们认为：是为了提高机关工作同志的文化水平，以适应工作的需要。当然，这不仅是为了今天工作上的需要，同时也是为了明天工作上的需要。干部文化程度的提高，不仅可以帮助干部提高业务能力，而且可以帮助干部进一步提高政治理论水平。
    中共中央直属机关的中下级干部和一般工作人员，大多是在土地革命时期、抗日战争时期和解放战争时期参加工作的工农分子，他们在党的长期教育下具有一定的政治水平，但文化程度不高，其中不少同志只是初识文字，他们普遍要求学习文化。
    根据上述目的和机关的具体情况，我们规定机关业余文化补习教育今天应该达到的要求，是尽可能地把机关中下级干部和大多数工作人员逐步提高到相当初中毕业的程度。现在的业余文化补习学校，就是按照这个要求来进行工作的。在工作过程中，有的同志曾认为可以降低要求，我们认为这种想法是不对的，因为这不仅不能适应工作的要求，也不能达到提高干部的目的。也有的同志建议应以达到相当高中毕业程度为目标，我们认为目前一下就提出这样高的要求是不适当的，因为机关工作人员的文化水平应当逐步提高。就我们机关情况来说，一小部分同志达到高小毕业程度时，在工作条件允许的情况下，即离开机关转到其他学校去学习了，他们可以在学校里面提高文化水平；绝大部分同志在达到初中毕业程度时，就参加了理论学习，在理论学习中继续逐步地提高着文化程度。至于具有初中毕业程度的同志应当用什么方式来继续提高文化程度的问题，尚待研究。
    我们的教育重点，首先是今天的干部，其次是有发展前途而学习条件较好的一般工作人员，即明天的干部；同时也要尽可能使机关全体人员都有机会受到教育。
    由于学员的出身、工作情况、学习条件和学习要求都不一样，我们采取了“区别对象，分别对待”的原则，按照这个原则，定出不同的教育计划和教学进度。
    机关业余文化补习教育的教学方针，我们认为毛主席对军队实施文化教育所规定的“速成的，联系实际的，但又是正规的”方针，对我们机关干部的业余文化补习教育是完全适用的。机关业余文化补习教育必须是“速成的”，因为多数学员已具有一定的政治水平，且多系成年，理解力一般的比较高，同时也因为是在工作中学习，时间有限，不能不求速成。在教学要求上，应该是既“速”又“成”，量、质并重。在课程教材方面，应适当加以精简。在教学方法方面，应根据学员特点和优点采用速成的方法；当然，只图快而不注意巩固也是不对的。机关业余文化补习教育必须是“联系实际的”，因为机关干部的社会常识和生活常识都是比较丰富的，联系实际的教学既容易教，又容易懂，既受学员欢迎，又能直接帮助工作。联系实际又是达到速成的一个条件。机关业余文化补习教育必须是“正规的”。我们认为机关业余文化补习学校的正规化，主要是要有一定的学制，要有一定的组织机构，要有步骤有计划地学完规定的初中课程，教学要有计划性和持续性，学校要有完成教学计划所必需的各项制度。
    在办理机关业余文化补习学校的过程中，我们曾遇到学员在思想上和实践上工作和学习时间发生矛盾的问题。我们是以“工作要做好，学习要学好”作为基本口号来解决这个问题的，即首先强调工作要做好，决不能因为学习而妨碍工作，但在做好工作的条件下，行政方面应保证学员必要的业余学习时间，如因工作必须耽误上课时间时，领导方面应准予在适当的工作时间内去补课。对学员必须同时强调学习要学好，强调很好地利用学习时间。我们认为有的同志把工作和学习对立起来的提法是不恰当的。
      关于机关业余文化补习学校的领导问题
    我们机关的业余文化补习学校是由各级党的组织领导的。
    我们体会到：机关党的组织和各级领导干部对机关业余文化补习教育工作的重视和具体领导，是办好机关业余文化补习学校的关键。不但机关最高一级领导人员要重视，各级领导人员都要重视，甚至基层领导人员的重视与否，对学员的学习也有重大的影响。要作到这一点，最主要的是要求党的组织和各级领导干部，认识机关业余文化补习教育工作的意义和作用。在我们机关里，党的组织和各级领导人员是重视这一工作的。在党代表大会通过的支部工作纲要中，把组织和领导机关全体人员学习作为第一项具体工作。大家也认真遵守了这一规定。
    领导重视，又表现在各级党的组织设有专人负责，并规定了一定的工作制度。中直党委规定：“文化教育工作为党的支部教育工作的一部分，各党委、总支、直属支部负责领导该项工作”；规定“各党委、总支、直属支部应设文化教育委员，具体掌管机关人员文化教育事宜”；规定“各党委、总支、直属支部应定期地布置、检查、总结，向党委汇报该项工作”（一般地每半年布置、讨论、总结一次，中间检查）。
    领导重视，还表现在保证学员的一定的学习时间（其他活动尽可能不占用固定的上课时间），和配备一定数量的专职干部和专任教员，作为教学中的骨干，协助和提高兼任教员，搞好教学工作，并及时解决必要的教室、教学设备等问题。
    在另一方面，文化补习学校本身也应该主动地取得党的组织对自己的领导，如将计划、报告总结送领导方面审阅，求得指示，并及时反映情况、提出问题请求解决等。由于机关领导人员不可能有很多的时间过问学校的工作，所以文化补习学校的这种做法是十分重要的。
      中直党委对各机关业余文化补习教育工作的领导，除了决定方针、原则和一定时间的计划外，日常工作由党委办公室负责，并在办公室教育组中指定几个同志专门掌管文化教育工作，分别研究教学和教育行政事宜。在指导教学方面，我们将各补习学校同科同班教员组成各科（又分各班）教学研究组，通过各科教学研究组，进行选编教材、编写提纲、研究和制订各科的教学目的和要求，研究教学计划和具体教案等工作，并组织教学观摩等。教育行政方面的工作，是收集研究各单位试订的各种条例、制度等材料，整理印发供各校参考。
      关于机关业余文化补习学校的学制、课程和时间问题
    中直机关业余文化补习学校的学制、课程、时间问题，一九五一年上学期前，是由各机关分别制订试行的。一九五一年九月，党委第一次制订了中直机关统一的两种试行学制，初步规定了统一的学制、课程和学习时间。一九五二年九月中直机关第一次文化教育工作会议后，作了第二次改革，至一九五三年八月以前我们又作了一次改革。从三次学制改革工作中，得到了如下的经验和教训：
    首先，我们认识到学制问题是办理机关业余文化补习学校的一个根本问题，也是一个非常复杂的问题。在学制中要体现业余文化补习学校的教育方针，要具体反映机关学校和学员的特点；学制是课程、时间、上课、作业等重大问题相互结合的集中表现，也是解决机关业余文化补习学校各种矛盾的中心一环。
    其次，我们认为在制订学制时，应当注意以下几点：
    一、要照顾全面情况，主要是照顾以下四个方面：1、机关的工作情况；2、学员的实际情况；3、教学的实际情况；4、过去改革学制中的经验教训。
    二、要对学期和学年作一般性的规定，以便于学校分期布置和总结工作，掌握学校工作的规律性。我们是这样规定的：一年分为两个学期，合为一学年。每学期定为二十二周，实际上课时间为二十周，其他两周进行开学的准备工作和学期的结束工作。每学年放寒、暑假各一次，每次定为一个月。根据机关的实际情况，寒假一般在二月（春节在内），暑假一般在八月。每次假期中，学校应总结经验，以改进工作，在学员中组织复习或补习。
    三、应根据机关实际情况，坚持“区别对象、分别对待”的原则。因为机关学员情况复杂，在学习时间、课程、进度和要求等方面，应有不同对待。机关学员大体可分为干部、一般工作人员中学习条件较好的和一般工作人员中学习条件较差的等三种，学制应从照顾大多数（一、二两种）出发，同时必须照顾到学习条件较差的少数学员。
    四、正确地估计和掌握时间，是制订学制的中心一环。因为时间问题是机关工作、学习和业余活动矛盾的焦点，解决时间问题就是解决矛盾的关键。根据过去的经验，在时间问题上要正确掌握以下三个方面：
     （一）在保证工作的条件下，要适当地分配学习、党团活动和休息的时间，学制应从保证工作和照顾休息时间以外可能有的学习时间出发，以解决学员学习和工作、休息的矛盾。
     （二）在全部学习时间中，应将上课和复习作业时间作适当分配，并研究在具体方法上如何结合。只定上课时间而不正式规定复习作业的时间，是不适当的。在作业时间适当规定后，要严格控制，不能由教员随意增多或减少。
    （三）要正确估计各种课程实际需要的教学时间，要以绝大多数学员能够接受并照顾少数学员能够赶上为原则。由于教学方法改进而有减少教学时间的可能时，也应遵守稳步前进的原则。
    五、关于必修课程问题：由于机关业余文化补习学校的学员的学习时间有限，而整个学习年限又不能拖得过长，因此，必修课程不能定得过多。依中直机关情况看来，以学习语文、算术、代数、地理、历史等几门课程为宜。其他自然科学课程对学员也是必要的，但因受时间限制，不适于普遍开班进行教学。党委决定今后试行用讲座方式进行教学。但各单位如在时间、教员等方面具备条件者，也可开班讲授。
    同时要明确规定对各科教学的要求，根据我们机关的情况，应该以语文课作为各科中的基本课程；地理课重点应为本国地理及世界政治地理；历史课重点应为中国近代史和世界现代史；代数教学的要求，也应较普通中学的教学要求适当降低。
    六、在制订学制时，对各种课程应作合理的排列，一般的应注意以下三个原则：
     （一）适当集中，一学期只学一门至两门课程，以便集中力量，循序渐进。
    （二）在小学阶段以首先单科学习语文，并在一贯保持语文程度较高的基础上学习其他课程为好。这样，一方面可适应学员对语文的迫切需要，另一方面，语文程度高，更有利于其他课程的速成。扫除文盲的教学以作为单独阶段为宜（因所需学习时间很不一致）。算术课程应当是直线上升，不必重复循环；初中算术部分可结合小学算术部分一起学完，升入初中即可学习代数。
    （三）要照顾各科客观的联系。语文以连续学习一贯到底为好，算术应连接代数的学习，不要脱节，要具有较高的语文程度才能学好地理和历史，历史的学习可排列在最后，以便和理论学习相衔接。
    七、由于学员中的工作情况、学习时间、学习能力和现有文化程度各有不同，要求在一个机关内执行同一学制是不行的。根据过去的经验，我们曾规定了三种学制，各机关应采用何种学制或同时采用几种学制，我们要求他们根据具体情况，灵活掌握。
