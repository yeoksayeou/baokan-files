Combining Grain Purchase and Winter Production Work
Henan Actively Prepares to Establish Agricultural Cooperatives

Following the First Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference convened by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, local Party committees are actively preparing to carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement in a planned way, centering on the grain purchase work and winter production.

Most of the local Party committees have successively held mutual aid and cooperation meetings. Generally, the county Party committee members in charge of mutual aid and cooperation in each county participated in the meetings convened by the local Party committees, and some cadres from the directly subordinate organs of the local Party committees were also absorbed. The Luoyang local Party committee also absorbed construction team cadres and some backbone members for cooperative transformation. At the meeting, according to the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference, some problems in leading mutual aid and cooperation were reviewed, experiences were summarized and exchanged, and cooperative establishment tasks were specifically arranged.

Most of the local, county, and district committees have designated one member to be responsible for mutual aid and cooperation work. In the Xinxiang area, eight counties are directly managed by the deputy secretary of the county Party committee. The Shangqiu local Party committee stipulated that each county should draw three cadres to establish a mutual aid and cooperation office. Many local Party committees have determined construction team cadres. The Puyang local Party committee organized a construction team of thirty people (four at the county level and twenty-six at the district level). The Anyang local Party committee plans to train 5,000 mutual aid team leaders in each county this winter, train 300 cooperative transformation backbone members in early January, and absorb 150 construction team cadres to participate; it will also train more than 160 leaders of old cooperatives and more than 300 cooperative accountants. The Zhengzhou local Party committee plans to train 1,000 people in winter and spring, divided into three phases, the first phase of which began on the 14th of last month. The Xinyang local Party committee plans to train more than 600 construction team cadres and cooperative transformation backbone members in two phases this winter, the first phase of which began on the 19th of last month. The counties in the Xinxiang area held short meetings to train construction team cadres and backbone members. According to statistics from eleven counties, 529 people participated in the meetings, including construction team cadres, Party branch secretaries of construction team villages, mutual aid team leaders and backbone members within the groups and cooperatives, and leaders of old cooperatives. These meetings focused on solving the problem of how to mobilize the masses to build cooperatives, and how to combine grain purchase work to carry out ideological mobilization for organization. The Xinxiang local Party committee also plans to hold a meeting of county Party committee members in charge of mutual aid and cooperation in each county when the first step of the grain purchase work is nearing completion, mainly to study specific policy issues such as land and livestock shares during cooperative transformation and distribution after the transformation.

The Xinxiang and Shangqiu local Party committees also emphasized summarizing the experience of building and running cooperatives. The Xinxiang local Party committee is holding a meeting of cooperative leaders to summarize experience. At the same time, it requires each county to summarize experience. Many local and county committees have also set up one or two key townships, equipped with stronger cadres, preparing to create experience, establish banners, and guide the movement.

    结合购粮和冬季生产工作
    河南积极准备建立农业合作社
    中共河南省委召开第一次互助合作会议以后，各地委都围绕收购粮食工作及冬季生产，积极准备有计划地开展互助合作运动。
    大部分地委都先后召开了互助合作会议。各地委召开的会议上，一般都是各县负责互助合作的县委参加，并吸收了地委直属机关的一部分干部，洛阳地委还吸收了建社干部和一些转社骨干参加。在会议上根据省委互助合作会议的精神，检查了领导互助合作中的一些问题，总结交流了经验，具体安排了建社任务。
    大部地、县、区委都确定了一个委员负责互助合作工作。新乡地区有八个县是由县委副书记直接负责。商邱地委规定每县要抽三个干部，成立互助合作办公室。很多地委都确定了建社干部。濮阳地委组织了三十个人（县级四人、区级二十六人）的建社工作队。安阳地委计划冬季由各县训练互助组长五千人，一月上旬训练转社骨干三百人，吸收一百五十个建社干部参加；还要训练一百六十多个老社的社长和三百多个合作社的会计。郑州地委计划冬春训练一千人，分为三期，第一期已于上月十四日开始。信阳地委计划冬季分两期训练建社干部与转社骨干六百多人，第一期已于上月十九日开始。新乡地区各县以召开短期会议的方法，进行了建社干部和骨干的训练，据十一个县统计，参加会议的五百二十九人，包括建社干部、建社村的党支部书记、互助组长及组、社内骨干、老社社长等。这些会议都集中地解决了如何发动群众进行建社，以及如何结合粮食收购工作进行组织起来的思想动员问题。新乡地委并计划待粮食收购工作第一步将近结束时，再召开一次各县负责互助合作的县委委员会议，主要研究转社时土地、牲口入股和转社后的分配等具体政策问题。
    新乡、商邱两地委还强调了总结建社、办社经验。新乡地委正在开社长座谈会议，总结经验。同时要求各县也要总结经验。很多地委、县委还设了一至两个重点乡，配有较强的干部，准备创造经验，树立旗帜，指导运动。
