Strive for Increased Production and Economy to Accelerate National Industrialization

    1953 was the first year of China's First Five-Year Plan. During this year, the workers of factories, mines, and transportation enterprises throughout the country responded to the Party's call and displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm in the movement for increased production and economy, creating a large amount of wealth for the country and ensuring the smooth development of the country's new construction undertakings.

    The three key projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company—the new large-scale rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and No. 7 blast furnace—have been completed one after another, and the opening ceremony was held in Anshan, the steel capital, on December 26th. This is the "sizing machine" of the seamless steel tube plant, which is adjusting the wall thickness of seamless steel tubes to meet the required specifications.

    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill old fitter Zhang Mingshan, a special-class labor model in Anshan City, with the support of the Party and the help of Soviet experts, successfully created a light rolling mill anti-encirclement disc in October 1952, which improved output and quality, fundamentally improved labor conditions, and created more than 50 billion yuan of wealth for the country every year, and opened up the road to mechanization and automation of the entire plant.

    Wang Chonglun, a young worker at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's machinery plant and a special-class labor model in Anshan City, completed three and a half years of production tasks on December 9th last year. This is him and his apprentices studying their work.

    The large-scale Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Coal Mine has overfulfilled the annual raw coal production plan ahead of schedule on December 10th last year. This is a power shovel loading raw coal onto a truck for transportation to various places.

    Tangshan Power Plant, the national advanced power plant and the model plant of North China Electric Power Industry, created a new record of 1,231 days of safe operation, ensuring safe power transmission by the end of December last year. Recently, the plant underwent a major overhaul to ensure safe production this year. This is the transformer being installed after the overhaul.

    The large transformer workshop of Shenyang Electrical Engineering Plant No. 5 completed the annual production task more than a month ahead of schedule in the movement for increased production and economy. The 66,000-volt and 10,000-kVA transformers manufactured by the plant are of great significance to China's accelerated industrialization.

    After completing the annual production plan ahead of schedule on November 15th, the state-owned Xin Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant completed the annual plan of increasing production and saving 30.2 billion yuan ahead of schedule by twelve days. Over the past year, the plant has supported basic construction projects in various places with a large number of products. The cold-cast wheels alone can supply the needs of manufacturing more than 1,500 carriages. This is the scene of workers in the cold-casting workshop casting wheels.

    Zhao Ruiheng, the leader of the dismantling team of the locomotive workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and other 13 people, under the call of the factory's Party committee to increase production and save, actively implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, found tricks, and shortened the time for overhauling a car from three days to one and a half days, shortened the number of days for repairing cars, and ensured the timely supply of locomotives.

    The state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill is a new type of textile mill equipped with domestically made machines. The employees of the spinning workshop launched a movement to "reduce yarn breakage, improve product quality, and reduce costs" in June and July last year, creating the latest national record of less than 80 yarn breakages per hour per thousand spindles, and won the title of National Model Factory.

    The newly built automated Zhengzhou Power Plant has already started generating electricity. Zhengzhou, China's textile industrial area, will receive a full supply of power. This is the plant's outdoor substation.

    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is stepping up winter construction. In order to accelerate the progress of the project, the workers have displayed a high degree of initiative and creativity, greatly improving work efficiency. The non-ferrous metal casting workshop completed the 15-day hoisting project four days ahead of schedule, and the mechanical assembly workshop completed the hoisting project ten and a half days ahead of schedule, saving the country more than 300 million yuan in construction costs. This is a crane installing a large number of concrete roof panels.

    The state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill enthusiastically launched a labor competition after the National Day. In the first five days of the competition, the average output of 21-count yarn and serge, as well as the positive cloth rate of serge, have broken the plant's historical record. This is the scene of the sliver-handling team operating.

    The construction plan of the locomotive factory of the Chengdu Locomotive Repair Factory, which is under construction, has been basically completed. As of the end of November last year, it saved the country 2 billion yuan in wealth.

    The private Yongli Chemical Industrial Company, Tianjin Plant, has incorporated production into the national plan since the joint state-private partnership in the second half of 1952. Production in the past year has increased by more than 50% compared with before the joint venture. In addition to accumulating funds for the country, it has also expanded its main production equipment. This is the main raw material allocated to the factory by the state - salt.

    All employees of the Yumen Oilfield have completed the annual crude oil production task two months and seventeen days ahead of schedule. This is the refinery after its expansion.

    努力增产节约加速国家工业化
    一九五三年是我国第一个五年计划的第一年。在这一年当中，全国各地各厂、矿、交通企业的全体职工响应党的号召在增产节约运动中发挥了高度的劳动热情，为国家创造了大量的财富。保证了国家新建设事业的顺利开展。
    鞍山钢铁公司的三大重点工程——新型的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和七号炼铁炉已先后完工，并于十二月二十六日在钢都鞍山举行了开工生产典礼。这是无缝钢管厂的“均整机”，它正把无缝钢管的管壁均整成为合乎要求的规格。
    鞍山市特等劳动模范、鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂老钳工张明山在党的支持下和苏联专家的帮助下，一九五二年十月成功地创造了光轧机反围盘，提高了产量和质量，从根本上改善了劳动条件，不仅为国家每年多创造五百多亿的财富，而且开辟了全厂机械化、自动化的道路。
