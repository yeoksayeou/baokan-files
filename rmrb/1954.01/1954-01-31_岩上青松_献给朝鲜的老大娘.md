　　Green Pine on the Rock
    --Dedicated to the Korean Old Lady
　　Ge Bizhou
　　There was an old lady,
　　Living on the front line,
　　The enemy shelled all day,
　　Collapsing her house.
　　Fish never leave the river,
　　The old lady would never leave her hometown,
　　The Volunteer Army helped her dig a cave,
　　The old lady lived in peace and comfort.
　　Her daughter-in-law and eldest son went to the army,
　　The second son was young by her side,
　　The old man died under the enemy's knife,
　　The old lady buried her head and worked hard.
　　Shells shattered her wheat seedlings,
　　Shells overturned her rice seedlings,
　　Shells buried her soybeans,
　　Shells knocked down her sorghum,
　　There were still large bombs in the field,
　　Bomb craters like large ponds,
　　The old lady didn't say a word,
　　She planted again immediately after the bombing.
　　Look at the green pine on the rock,
　　Growing strong in the cracks of the stones.
　　Not afraid of bombing and artillery fire,
　　There is our Volunteer Army in front,
　　A copper wall and iron barrier that will never break,
　　She has taken root here.
　　Unable to sleep in the middle of the night,
　　She got up and lit the lamp,
　　Soaked the soybeans and fed the millstone,
　　In a while, she ground a large basin,
　　Made tofu and called her son,
　　Seeing that the sky was about to dawn.
　　The mother and son carried the tofu bucket,
　　Delivering it to the front line, braving the artillery fire,
　　At dawn, the enemy fired a "wake-up call",
　　All the roads, big and small, were bombed.
　　The shells landed close,
　　Her son's legs trembled,
　　She told her son not to be afraid,
　　The Volunteer Army has difficulties in life!
　　There are no vegetables on the front line,
　　Only eating rice with salt water.
　　The son gained strength,
　　The mother walked happily,
　　Rushing through the smoke of gunfire,
　　Rushing through the blockade line.
　　The tofu was delivered to the position,
　　The soldiers surrounded the old lady.
　　Not knowing what to say,
　　They lifted her so high,
　　They didn't want it,
　　Only saying they dared not come again;
　　No matter how much they said, she wouldn't listen,
　　The old lady came again the next day.
　　This day was just dawning,
　　There was still the morning star,
　　The four mountains were still blurred,
　　People came on the road.
　　The "wake-up call" flew over,
　　The soldiers were worried,
　　The smoke of gunfire rose to the sky,
　　People walked through the smoke of gunfire,
　　Now they could see clearly,
　　The son and the mother.
　　Everyone told them to lower their heads,
　　Everyone told them to move forward quickly,
　　Walking to the crossroads,
　　That was the killing pit.
　　Hands were sweating,
　　The enemy's artillery roared again,
　　As if falling on the heart,
　　The soldiers' hearts were tight.
　　The smoke dispersed and the people were still there,
　　Still walking slowly,
　　Passing the dangerous place,
　　Everyone was happy in their hearts.
　　Who knew the enemy's artillery would chase again,
　　Only seeing the smoke of gunfire but not the people,
　　The soldiers rushed out of the position in a hurry,
　　Not seeing the son but seeing the mother,
　　One person carrying a tofu bucket,
　　Still rushing forward.
　　The soldiers crowded around her,
　　The old lady's face was very gloomy,
　　The son was bombed to death on the road,
　　The smoke of gunfire had passed and she could see clearly.
　　Some soldiers shed tears,
　　Some had fire in their eyes,
　　The old lady had no tears in her eyes,
　　Only hatred.
　　The tofu used to taste delicious,
　　Today no one tasted the tofu,
　　Not speaking during the day,
　　Thinking while lying down at night,
　　Thinking and thinking but no way,
　　How to comfort the old lady?
　　The attack order came in the middle of the night,
　　To seize the mountain on the opposite side,
　　This was a good time to avenge,
　　Killing the enemy to comfort the old lady.
　　Hanging grenades,
　　Holding submachine guns,
　　Heroes rushed up the mountain in anger,
　　The red flag was planted on the enemy's position.
　　The enemy's position was full of enemy corpses,
　　Seeing that the east was about to dawn,
　　If the old lady could see it with her own eyes,
　　The heroes would feel relieved.
　　The old lady will not come today,
　　The old lady is very sad at home,
　　Everyone wants to send someone to see,
　　Bringing the news of victory.
　　The sky was just dawning,
　　The "wake-up call" sounded again,
　　No one was seen on the high mountain position,
　　Only the sentry was watching.
　　The sentry looked back,
　　A small mountain road leading to the rear,
　　Shells fell on the side of the road,
　　Black smoke covered the white frost.
　　A cloud of smoke flew away,
　　How could the old lady be seen again!
　　The old lady was still delivering tofu,
　　Carrying the wooden bucket with strength,
　　The green pine on the high mountain danced in the wind,
　　The old lady's white hair fluttered in the wind,
　　All the heroes came out of the position,
　　The heroes' tears were cooled by the wind.

　　岩上青松
    ——献给朝鲜的老大娘
　　戈壁舟
　　有个老大娘，
　　住在前线上，
　　敌人成天在打炮，
　　轰塌她的房。
　　鱼儿不离江河水，
　　老大娘绝不离家乡，
　　志愿军帮她挖地洞，
　　老大娘住着倒安康。
　　媳妇大儿从军去，
　　二儿年小在身旁，
　　老汉死在敌刀下，
　　老大娘埋头生产忙。
　　炮弹打烂她麦苗，
　　炮弹翻掉她谷秧，
　　炮弹埋了她黄豆，
　　炮弹打倒她高粱，
　　地里还落大炸弹，
　　炸弹坑象大池塘，
　　老大娘不哼气，
　　炸过马上就种上。
　　看那岩上的青松，
　　石缝里面长得壮。
　　不怕投弹大炮轰，
　　前面有咱志愿军，
　　铜墙铁壁永不破，
　　她在这里生了根。
　　半夜睡不着，
　　起来点燃灯，
　　黄豆泡好喂磨眼，
　　一会磨了一大盆，
　　作好豆腐叫儿子，
　　看看天快明。
　　母子抬着豆腐桶，
　　冒着炮火送前线，
　　天亮敌打“起床炮”，
　　大路小路都轰断。
　　炮弹落的近，
　　儿子腿直闪，
　　她叫儿子不要怕，
　　志愿军生活有困难！
　　火线没菜吃，
　　光吃盐水饭。
　　儿子有了劲，
　　母亲走的欢，
　　冲过炮烟去，
　　冲过封锁线。
　　豆腐送到阵地上，
　　战士围着老大娘。
　　不知怎说好，
　　把她举的那样高，
　　不要又不行，
　　只说不敢再来到；
　　千说万说都不听，
　　隔天老大娘又来了。
　　这天天刚亮，
　　还有启明星，
　　四山还模糊，
　　路上来了人。
　　“起床炮”飞来，
　　战士直担心，
　　炮烟冲天起，
　　人穿炮烟行，
　　这下看清楚，
　　儿子和母亲。
　　都叫头低些，
　　都叫快前进，
　　走到三岔路，
　　那是杀人坑。
　　手都捏出汗，
　　敌炮又轰鸣，
　　好似落心上，
　　战士心好紧。
　　烟散人还在，
　　照样慢慢行，
　　过了危险地，
　　心里都高兴。
　　谁知敌炮又追来，
　　只见炮烟不见人，
　　战士发急出阵地，
　　不见儿子见母亲，
　　一人手提豆腐桶，
　　照样急急在前进。
　　战士拥到她跟前，
　　老大娘脸色好阴沉，
　　儿子炸死在路上，
　　炮烟过去看的清。
　　有的战士流了泪，
　　有的眼里冒火星，
　　大娘眼里没泪水，
　　只有仇和恨。
　　往日豆腐吃的香，
　　今天豆腐没人尝，
　　白天不说话，
　　晚上躺着想，
　　千想万想没办法，
　　怎样安慰老大娘？
　　夜半来了攻击令，
　　要夺对面那山岗，
　　这是报仇好时候，
　　杀敌安慰老大娘。
　　挂好手榴弹，
　　端好冲锋枪，
　　英雄一怒冲上山，
　　红旗插在敌阵上。
　　敌人阵地满敌尸，
　　眼看就要东方亮，
　　老大娘若能亲眼见，
　　英雄心里才舒畅。
　　老大娘今天不会来，
　　老大娘在家多悲伤，
　　都想派人去看看，
　　胜利消息都带上。
　　天刚麻麻亮，
　　“起床炮”又响，
　　高山阵地不见人，
　　只有哨兵在张望。
　　哨兵回头看，
　　小小山路通后方，
　　颗颗炮弹落路边，
　　黑色烟尘盖白霜。
　　一股炮烟飞开去，
　　怎么又见老大娘！
　　老大娘照样送豆腐，
　　手提木桶有力量，
　　高山青松迎风舞，
　　老大娘白发随风扬，
　　全体英雄出阵地，
　　英雄泪眼风吹凉。
