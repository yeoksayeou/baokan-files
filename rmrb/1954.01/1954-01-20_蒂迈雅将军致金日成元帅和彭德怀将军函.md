Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 19th. Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission Chairman, Lieutenant General Thimayya, sent a letter on January 14th to the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The full text of the original letter is as follows:

To the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers,

I have the honor to refer to this Commission's letter of 2nd January 1954 and the annexures attached thereto of the same date, and to refer to your letter of 7th January 1954, containing your comments on the interim report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission submitted by both parties and your replies to the above-mentioned letter from this Commission.

I. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's views on the various issues stated in paragraphs A, B, C, D, and E of the second paragraph of your letter have been included in the interim report submitted to you.

II. I do not feel that I can add anything to these issues or provide any useful advice on the third paragraph of your letter. I also cannot agree with all the opinions in the fourth paragraph of your letter, especially the statement that "the work of the committee is carried out according to the will of the special agents" and "the committee has in essence protected and supported the terrorist rule of the special agents, allowing the special agents to let go of the sabotage of the explanation work...". The position of this Commission in this regard is contained in the interim report and is also contained in my previous letters to you.

III. As mentioned in this Commission's letter of January 2, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has so far only been able to implement the measures stipulated in the "Terms of Reference" to a limited extent.

IV. Among the unrepatriated prisoners of war under the custody of this Commission, some are unwilling to exercise their right to repatriation, while a much larger number have failed to use the measures stipulated in the "Terms of Reference."

V. Neither political conferences were opened nor the explanation process completed when the ninety days after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over on September 24, 1953, had expired. For the above reasons, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission felt that it could not submit the issue of the handling of prisoners of war who had not exercised their right to repatriation to a political conference.

VI. These and other failures in the implementation of the "Terms of Reference" were not caused by reasons and factors caused by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission or the Indian Custodial Forces, nor are they responsible for them.

VII. Only by extending the explanation and custodial period and continuing the explanation and custodial duties, and only if both parties consider and agree on the necessary alternative measures arising from the failure of the political conference, can the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission further and more fully implement the methods and purposes stipulated in the "Terms of Reference." Such extension and alternative arrangements can only be achieved through an agreement reached by or with both parties.

VIII. Therefore, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission sent a letter to both parties on January 2, 1954, and specifically raised four questions: the continuation of the explanation, the hope that the political conference would be convened before January 22, the consultation between the two parties on alternative measures, and the continued responsibility of the Indian Custodial Forces for custody.

IX. This Commission has noted what is stated in paragraph 6 of your letter of January 7. Your reply to these questions states that you believe and insist that:

(A) The explanation period should be extended and the explanation should be restored.

(B) The issue of unrepatriated prisoners of war should be submitted to the political conference after the political conference is convened.

(C) The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces should continue to perform "its uncompleted legal duties."

X. The claims regarding the above issues have been stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the memorandum sent to you as an annex to this Commission's letter of January 2. Please refer to them. It has been pointed out there that continued explanation and custody are only possible with the agreement of both parties, and the reasons for this have also been stated.

XI. This agreement has not been reached. The United Nations Command has informed this Commission that such extension and continuation are not permissible and that the custodial authority of the Indian Custodial Forces will terminate on January 23, 1954. The United Nations Command further believes that there is no reason to enter into discussions to consider the handling of prisoners of war, and that, in its view, this issue is fully included in the "Terms of Reference," and it does not believe that the "Terms of Reference" can be allowed to be modified or amended.

XII. Therefore, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission finds that it is now unable to further implement the provisions and purposes of the "Terms of Reference." If an agreement cannot be reached between or with both parties to continue the custody of prisoners of war and continue this Commission, then the custody of prisoners of war must be terminated on January 23, 1954, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission itself must be dissolved on or before February 22, 1954. Here, since the two parties have not yet reached an agreement to negotiate and formulate other or further measures, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in order to fulfill its responsibilities and in the existing circumstances, must make its own decision regarding itself, the custodial forces, and the identity and handling of the prisoners of war.

XIII. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has given these issues concerned and careful consideration and has made the following decisions:

(1) This Commission has no right to release the prisoners of war under its custody, because under no circumstances does the "Terms of Reference" grant this Commission the power to release prisoners of war.

(2) Given the facts as they exist, this Commission has no right to "declare their prisoner of war status terminated and make them civilians," because the conditions and procedures stipulated in the "Terms of Reference" for making such a declaration have not been met.

(3) This Commission has no reason to assume that there is a reasonable hope of convening a political conference before January 22, 1954. The United Nations Command has informed this Commission of its opinion that such an outcome is "highly improbable." Your side has stated that you are unwilling to bear responsibility for the failure to convene a political conference, and has also pointed out that there is no hope of convening a political conference in the near future.

(4) This Commission cannot continue to maintain custody of prisoners of war in the absence of an agreement between the two parties on the continued custody of prisoners of war by this Commission, and without such an agreement, this Commission cannot extend its life beyond February 22, 1954.

XIV. Therefore, this Commission believes that it must regard the methods stipulated in the "Terms of Reference" as incomplete, and that this Commission has been placed in a powerless position and cannot more fully implement the "Terms of Reference." Therefore, given the facts and circumstances as they exist and giving them due consideration, the only viable path for me as the Chairman and Executor of this Commission is to return the unrepatriated prisoners of war to their original detaining parties just before January 23, 1954.

XV. Such return must be carried out at the northern edge of the demilitarized zone and within the perimeter of the Indian Custodial Forces in Songgok-ri. The original detaining party must accept this custody in its own area and in accordance with the established procedures for returning prisoners of war and the requirements of the Geneva Convention.

XVI. This Commission recommends that the work of restoring custody by the original detaining party should begin at 9:00 am on January 20, 1954, and should be completed as soon as possible.

XVII. As the Chairman and Executor of this Commission, I wish to state in the clearest possible manner that I am returning the prisoners of war to the custody of their original detaining parties because I can neither maintain custody of the prisoners of war, nor further implement the "Terms of Reference," nor release them. I am not doing this to make any changes to their status or to the final handling of the prisoners of war.

XVIII. Furthermore, in accordance with this Commission's authority to interpret the "Terms of Reference," this Commission believes that changing the status of prisoners of war, whether by declaring them civilians or by any other means, requires prior implementation of the explanation work and the steps of a political conference; such steps must proceed to a lawful conclusion in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned terms of reference, unless both parties agree on other steps or practices regarding the status and handling of prisoners of war. Any unilateral action by any relevant party would be inconsistent with the "Terms of Reference."

XIX. In taking this path, I am acting out of a sincere desire to advance the purposes of the armistice agreement, to adhere to lawful and impartial procedures in the existing circumstances, to avoid the possible outbreak of violence, and to act in accordance with the purposes and spirit of the Geneva Convention regarding the treatment of prisoners of war.

XX. I would like to venture to express the confident hope that both parties will also act out of the same desire when taking steps in the future regarding the status and handling of the prisoners of war who will soon be returned to their respective custodies.

XXI. I express my gratitude to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers for their thoughtful reply to this Commission's letter of January 2, 1954, and wish to assure them that this Commission has strived objectively and to the best of its ability to fulfill its obligations. I would be grateful if you could reply to this Commission's letter before January 16, 1954.

    蒂迈雅将军致金日成元帅和彭德怀将军函
    【新华社平壤十九日电】中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将于一月十四日致函朝鲜人民军最高司令官与中国人民志愿军司令员。原函全文如下：朝鲜人民军最高司令官中国人民志愿军司令员
    我荣幸地提请查照本委员会一九五四年一月二日函及同日附于该函的附件，并提请查照你们一九五四年一月七日函，此函内有你们对于提交双方的中立国遣返委员会临时报告的评论及你们对于上述本委员会之函的答复。
    一、中立国遣返委员会对于上述你们来函第二段之甲、乙、丙、丁、戊各分段内所述各项问题的看法，已经载入提交你们的临时报告内。
    二、我觉得我对于这些问题不能有所增益，或对你们来信的第三段提供任何有用的意见。我也不能同意你们来函第四段之内一切的意见，特别不能同意这样的说法，如：“委员会的工作都要按照特务的意志来进行”和“委员会在实质上就保护和支持了特务的恐怖统治，使特务得以放手破坏解释工作……”。本委员会在这方面的立场已载于临时报告中，并亦包含于我前几次给你们的信件内。
    三、像本委员会一月二日函内所提到的，中立国遣返委员会迄今只能有限度地实施“职权范围”所规定的那些办法。
    四、在本委员会看管下的那些未遣返的战俘中，有些是不愿行使其遣返权利的，而为数多得多的那些人则未能使用“职权范围”所规定的那些办法。
    五、在中立国遣返委员会于一九五三年九月二十四日接管后九十天完了时，既没有开政治会议，也没有完成解释过程。为了上述理由，中立国遣返委员会觉得它自己无法把未行使遣返权利的战俘的处理问题提交政治会议。
    六、这些与其他在实施“职权范围”上的失败，并非由于中立国遣返委员会或印度看管部队所引起的原因和因素造成的，对此他们也并不负有责任。
    七、只有延长解释与看管期限和继续解释与看管，只有双方对由于政治会议未能实现而引起的必要的代替性的办法予以考虑并达成协议，中立国遣返委员会才能进一步和更充分地实施“职权范围”内所规定的办法与目的。只有由双方达成协议或者与双方达成协议，此种延长与代替性的安排才能实现。
    八、因此中立国遣返委员会以一九五四年一月二日的函件送交双方，并特别提出了关于解释的继续、政治会议在一月二十二日前召开的希望、双方关于代替性的办法的协商以及印度看管部队继续负责看管等四个问题。
    九、本委员会已注意到了你们一月七日来信第六段中所述的。你们对这些问题的答复说，你们认为并坚持：
      （甲）解释期限应予延长，解释应予恢复。
      （乙）未遣返的战俘的问题应于政治会议召开后提交政治会议。
    （丙）中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队应继续执行“其尚未完成的合法职务”。
    十、关于上述各项问题的主张，已在送交给你们的作为本委员会一月二日函附件的备忘录中第一与第三段里述说过了，请你们查照。在那里已经指出：只有双方同意，继续解释与看管才有可能，此中理由亦已说过。
    十一、此种协议并未达成。联合国军已告知本委员会说这种延长与继续是不能允许的，并说印度看管部队的看管职权于一九五四年一月二十三日终止。联合国军更认为没有进入讨论以考虑战俘处理的理由，并说照它的看法这个问题已充分地包括在
  “职权范围”内了，而它不认为“职权范围”是可以允许修改或修正的。
    十二、因此中立国遣返委员会发现它现在无法进一步实施“职权范围”的规定与目的。假如双方之间或与双方不能达成继续看管战俘与继续本委员会的协议，则对战俘的看管必须于一九五四年一月二十三日终止，中立国遣返委员会本身必须于一九五四年二月二十二日或在此以前解散。此处，由于双方还没有达成协议来协商制定其他或进一步的办法，中立国遣返委员会为执行其责任，并在现时存在的情况下，必须对其本身、对看管部队、并对战俘的身份与处理作出自己的决定。
    十三、中立国遣返委员会对各项问题已给予关切与仔细的考虑，并已作出下列决定：
    （一）本委员会无权释放在其看管下的战俘，因为无论在何种情况之下“职权范围”并未授与本委员会释放战俘的权力。
      （二）按现时存在的事实说，本委员会无权“宣布解除他们的战俘身份使之成为平民”，因为“职权范围”所规定的作这种宣布的条件和程序并未实现。
    （三）本委员会没有理由来设想在一九五四年一月二十二日以前有召开政治会议的合理希望。关于这样结局的“极不可能”，联合国军已将这一点作为其意见告知了本委员会。你方已表示不愿对政治会议未能召开一事承担责任，并也指出在最近的将来没有召开政治会议的希望。
      （四）本委员会在双方对继续由本委员会看管战俘一事并无协议时，不可能继续保持看管战俘，并且没有这样的协议，本委员会也不可能延长其寿命至一九五四年二月二十二日之后。
    十四、因此本委员会认为它必须把“职权范围”所规定的办法看作并未完成，而且本委员会已被置于无能为力的境地，不能更充分实施“职权范围”。因此，按现时存在的事实与情形并对之加以适当的考虑，我作为本委员会的主席与执行人唯一可行之路，是紧在一九五四年一月二十三日以前把未遣返的战俘交还他们的原拘留各方。
    十五、这样的交还必须在非军事区的北部边缘和松谷里印度看管部队的周界上进行。原拘留一方必须在其自己地区内，并根据送回战俘的既定程序及日内瓦公约的要求接受这一看管。
    十六、本委员会建议由原拘留一方恢复看管的工作，应自一九五四年一月二十日九时开始，并应尽速予以完成。
    十七、作为本委员会的主席与执行人，我愿以最明确的方式声明：我把战俘交还原拘留一方看管，是因为我既不能保持对战俘的看管，又不能进一步实施“职权范围”，也不能把他们释放。我这么做并不是要对他们的身份作任何改变，或者对战俘的最后处理。
    十八、此外，遵照本委员会解释“职权范围”的职权，本委员会认为若用宣布成为平民身份，或者用任何其他方式的处理来改变战俘的身份，都需要在此之前实施解释工作和政治会议的步骤；这种步骤须根据上述职权（范围）的规定进行到合法的终局，除非双方关于战俘身份与处理商定其他步骤或做法。任何有关方面的任何片面行动将不符合于“职权范围”。
    十九、在采取这一路径时，我是出于诚挚的愿望以推进停战协定的目的，按现时存在的情况遵守合法的、不偏不倚的程序，避免暴力的可能爆发，并依照关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约的目的与精神来行事。
    二十、我愿冒昧表示有信心的希望：双方在将来对于即将交还给他们各自去看管的战俘的身份与处理采取步骤时，也将出于相同的愿望。
    二十一、我对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面对本委员会一九五四年一月二日的信的深思熟虑的答复表示感激，并愿向他们保证本委员会已努力客观地并尽其力之所及以履行其义务。如果你在一九五四年一月十六日以前能对本委员会的这封信予以答复，我将为之感激。
        中立国遣返委员会主席　蒂迈雅中将
                      一九五四年一月十四日
