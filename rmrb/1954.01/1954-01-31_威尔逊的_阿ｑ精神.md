　　Wilson's "Ah Q Spirit"
    Wu Fei

    A United Press Washington dispatch of January 26 reported that at a Pentagon press conference on January 26, U.S. Defense Secretary Wilson announced that he had ordered the Department of the Army to immediately discharge the twenty-one American prisoners of war in Songgot-ri who refused repatriation, and that he believed that this "dishonorable discharge" was a "punishment" for these American prisoners of war.

    In fact, what is there to boast about America's "military status"! On April 17 last year, Stephen H. Shinn, a former U.S. Army Reserve officer, personally wrote to Eisenhower, declaring his resignation from his position in the U.S. Army. Stephen H. Shinn wrote in his letter: "I cannot serve in an army that is engaged in the Korean War or a war that the U.S. government has announced it is planning. I cannot serve in an army that uses fleas and spiders carrying germs. I cannot serve in an army that fights alongside Nazi war criminals." Obviously, in Stephen H. Shinn's view, maintaining his military status in the American army was indeed a "dishonorable" thing, and was truly a "punishment" for a person's dignity!

    However, American generals do want to "punish" these "American kids" who are unwilling to return, because they were born in America, grew up in America, and have parents and wives in America, and now they are unwilling to return to America. Isn't this a cruel irony to the so-called "free world"? Although American generals hope these prisoners of war will return, they also have a guilty conscience and have never dared to go to Songgot-ri to explain, because they know that if the explanation is ineffective, wouldn't it make the "free world" even more "dishonorable"?

    On January 26, the American prisoners of war, South Korean prisoners of war, and British prisoners of war who refused repatriation in Songgot-ri held a press conference in Panmunjom. The American prisoners of war once again publicly stated that they were unwilling to return to the United States, which is full of political persecution, McCarthyism, lynching of black people, and racial discrimination. Therefore, Wilson's so-called "punishment" announced in desperation fully demonstrates his own "Ah Q spirit." As for the American prisoners of war who refused repatriation, isn't it exactly what they wanted?

　　威尔逊的“阿Ｑ精神”
    吴非
    据美联社华盛顿一月二十六日电讯报道：在一月二十六日五角大楼的记者招待会上，美国国防部长威尔逊宣布他已下令陆军部立即解除松谷里拒绝遣返的二十一名美国战俘的“军籍”，而且他认为：这种“不光荣的解除军籍”，是对这些美国战俘的“惩罚”。
    其实，美国的“军籍”又有什么值得炫耀的呢！去年四月十七日，曾任美国陆军后备军官的斯蒂芬·希姆，不是亲自写信给艾森豪威尔，声明辞退他在美国陆军中的职务吗？斯蒂芬·希姆在信中写道：“我不能在一个从事朝鲜战争或者美国政府宣布正在策划的战争的军队中服役。我不能在一个使用携带病菌的跳蚤和蜘蛛的军队中服役。我不能在一个与纳粹战犯并肩作战的军队中服役。”显然，斯蒂芬·希姆看来，保持美国军队的军籍，倒的确是一件“不光荣”的事，才真正是对一个人的尊严的“惩罚”呢！
    不过，美国将军们的确是想“惩罚”一下这些不愿回来的“美国孩子”的，因为他们生在美国，长在美国，父母、妻子都在美国，现在居然不愿回到美国，这对所谓“自由世界”不是残酷的讽刺吗？尽管美国将军如此希望这些战俘回来，但又作贼心虚，一直不敢到松谷里去进行解释，他们知道要是解释无效，不是使“自由世界”更“不光荣”吗？
    一月二十六日，松谷里拒绝遣返的美国战俘和南朝鲜战俘、英国战俘一起，到板门店举行了一次记者招待会，美国战俘再一次公开声明，他们不愿回到充满政治迫害、麦卡锡主义、对黑人的私刑和种族歧视的美国去。因此，威尔逊在无可奈何之余宣布的所谓“惩罚”，十足地表现了他自己的“阿Ｑ精神”。至于对于拒绝遣返的美国战俘来说，不正是他们求之不得吗？
