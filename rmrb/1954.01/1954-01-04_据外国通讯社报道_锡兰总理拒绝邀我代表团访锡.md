According to Foreign News Agencies:

Ceylon Prime Minister Refuses Invitation for Our Delegation to Visit Ceylon

[Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] According to foreign news agencies: Fang Xichun, head of the Ceylon government trade delegation, who had twice been to Beijing to negotiate trade agreements and contracts with the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, recently requested the Ceylon government to invite a delegation from the People's Republic of China to visit Ceylon. However, Ceylon Prime Minister Kotelawala has twice expressed his refusal to this request on December 12th and 18th.

The Ceylon "Times of Ceylon" published a commentary on December 17th saying that Prime Minister Kotelawala seems to have forgotten that Ceylon has gained huge benefits in the first year of trade with China. The newspaper pointed out that this trade has saved Ceylon from the brink of starvation and the bankruptcy facing the rubber industry. The newspaper suspects that Kotelawala's attitude was influenced by the tricks played by US Vice President Nixon during his "visit" to Ceylon.

    据外国通讯社报道
    锡兰总理拒绝邀我代表团访锡
    【新华社三日讯】据外国通讯社报道：曾两次到北京与中华人民共和国中央人民政府商订贸易协定与合同的锡兰政府贸易代表团团长方席卡，不久前曾要求锡兰政府邀请中华人民共和国派遣代表团到锡兰访问。但是，锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉已在十二月十二日和十八日两次表示拒绝这个要求。
    锡兰“特兰周报”在十二月十七日发表评论说：科特拉瓦拉总理好像忘记了锡兰已经在与中国进行贸易的第一年中获得了巨大的利益。该报指出：这一贸易已将锡兰从饥饿的边缘和橡胶工业面临的破产中拯救出来了。该报怀疑科特拉瓦拉的态度是受美国副总统尼克松在锡兰“访问”时所玩弄的诡计的影响。
