Xinhua News Agency report: Credit cooperative undertakings throughout the country have played their due role in rural areas and are loved by the peasants. At present, Party committees and People's Banks in various regions are strengthening their leadership over this work.

In recent years, due to the development of credit cooperative organizations in various regions, peasants have recognized the benefits of credit cooperatives. Recently, with the vigorous publicity of the general line for the transition period by the state to the peasants, and with the peasants selling large quantities of surplus grain to the state, peasants in various regions have enthusiastically subscribed for shares and joined credit cooperative organizations. In December of last year, peasants in Hebei Province, in addition to using the money from selling grain to purchase means of production, voluntarily requested the local people's governments to establish credit cooperative organizations to deposit their temporarily unused money. The province has newly established thirty-two credit departments, absorbing a large amount of deposits. At the People's Representative Conference in Yongji County, Shanxi Province, many representatives suggested that credit cooperatives be organized in the villages as soon as possible. In Shanggao Township, Tai'an County, Shandong Province, more than 340 peasant households joined the credit cooperative in early December of last year. In Rehe Province, during the grain purchase work, forty-six new credit cooperatives and credit departments of supply and marketing cooperatives were established throughout the province.

Currently, Party committees and People's Banks in various regions attach great importance to mutual aid and cooperation. Party committees and People's Banks at all levels in the Southwest region have conducted in-depth investigations, summarized experiences, and are working on sorting them out in order to further consolidate and improve credit cooperative organizations. The policy of the Central South region for rural credit cooperative organizations is to consolidate and improve existing credit cooperative organizations, and to vigorously develop them under the active and steady policy. The Guangdong Branch of the People's Bank of China has dispatched cadres to the Yuezhong area for investigation and research to prepare conditions for the development of credit cooperative organizations. The Rehe Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a provincial credit cooperation work conference in mid-December of last year, deciding that credit cooperatives should be established in the vast majority of rural areas throughout the province before April 1954. Village-level supply and marketing cooperatives with a strong business foundation should also establish credit departments.

According to incomplete statistics, there are 6,871 credit cooperatives, more than 14,000 credit mutual aid groups, and 2,137 credit departments set up in supply and marketing cooperatives nationwide. According to incomplete statistics from the five major regions of Central South, North China, Southwest, Northwest, and East China, there are a total of 3,722,300 members. Taking the Southwest as an example, the average share capital of each credit cooperative is more than 27 million yuan.

Over the past few years, credit cooperatives, credit mutual aid groups, and credit departments of supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have absorbed a large amount of surplus funds from peasants and provided timely loans to farmers with difficulties in production and life, playing a very important role in developing agricultural production and combating rural usury. Under the specific leadership of local party and government organs and People's Banks, credit mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the Northwest region absorbed 20.3 billion yuan of idle rural funds (excluding share capital) and issued more than 20 billion yuan in loans last year alone. Among the loans issued, the proportion of loans to solve the production and living difficulties of farmers was the largest. Since their establishment, the credit cooperative organizations in Mi County, Chenggao, Xinzheng, and Weishi counties in Henan Province have helped farmers purchase more than 1,500 head of livestock, more than 4,000 large and small farm tools, more than 100,000 catties of fertilizer, and purchased and repaired more than 400 large and small vehicles.

Credit cooperative organizations are most welcomed by farmers for providing timely loans to solve farmers' urgent difficulties in sideline production, disasters, diseases, weddings and funerals, and lack of food. Since its establishment a year ago, the Nanhui Township Credit Cooperative in Chenghai County, Guangdong Province, has solved more than 400 such difficulties for its members. When Zhao Zhilin's father in Beizhao Village, Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, died, he did not have cash at the time, and the village credit cooperative lent him 600,000 yuan to handle the funeral. Because there are credit cooperative organizations in various places, farmers' various urgent small loans can be solved in a timely manner with simple procedures. In many places, farmers call credit cooperatives their small banks, which can save them in emergencies.

Some local credit cooperatives pay attention to close contact with agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations to better serve production. The Gujing Township Credit Cooperative in Santai County, Sichuan Province, signed a "savings and loan contract" with the production mutual aid group. According to the production needs of its members, it adopted the method of joint lending and joint use or joint lending and separate use to carry out business, which promoted the development of production mutual aid groups and also consolidated the credit cooperative. Eleven credit cooperatives in Jiyuan County, Henan Province, helped 175 agricultural production mutual aid groups solve the difficulty of lacking means of production within one quarter.

In some areas, the triangle contact contract signed between credit cooperatives, production mutual aid groups, and supply and marketing cooperatives also has a very good effect. Last spring, the Zhangwangqu Village Credit Cooperative and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, and 183 households including the village's mutual aid group and some individual farmers, signed a triangle contact contract to produce 9,800 reed mats. The supply and marketing cooperative was responsible for the supply of raw materials and the sales of finished products, and the credit cooperative was responsible for regulating funds. This not only solved the food problem of 183 farmers, but also added seven head of draught animals and ten handcarts.

    广大农民欢迎信用互助合作事业
    各地中共党委和银行正加强领导这一工作
    据新华社讯：全国各地信用互助合作事业在农村中已发挥它应有的作用，受到农民的爱戴。现各地中共党委和人民银行正加强对这一工作的领导。
    几年来，由于各地信用互助合作组织的发展，农民已认识到信用合作社的好处。最近，在全国大张旗鼓向农民宣传国家过渡时期总路线，农民大量向国家出售余粮的情况下，各地农民更纷纷入股参加信用互助合作组织。去年十二月间，河北省农民除把卖粮得到的钱购买生产资料外，都自动向当地人民政府提出要求成立信用合作组织，把暂时用不着的钱存起来。全省已新成立了三十二个信用部，吸收了大宗存款。山西省永济县召开的各界人民代表会议上，不少代表建议迅速在村里组织信用合作社。山东省泰安县上高乡农民在去年十二月初有三百四十多户农民参加了信用合作社。热河省在购粮工作中，全省新成立了四十六个信用合作社和供销合作社信用部。
    目前，中共各地党委和人民银行对互助合作事业极为重视。西南各级党委和各级人民银行已进行深入调查，总结经验，并着手整理，以便进一步巩固和提高信用互助合作组织。中南区各地对农村信用互助合作组织的方针，是巩固提高已有的信用合作组织，在积极的稳步的方针下，大力发展。中国人民银行广东省分行，已抽派干部分赴粤中区调查研究，为发展信用互助组织准备条件。中共热河省委去年十二月中旬召开了全省信用合作工作会议，决定一九五四年四月前，在全省绝大多数的农村都要建立信用合作社。业务基础较强的村基层供销合作社也都要附设信用部。
    据不完全统计，全国已有信用合作社六千八百七十一个，信用互助组一万四千多个，设在供销合作社的信用部二千一百三十七个。据中南、华北、西南、西北、华东五个大区的不完全统计，共有社员三百七十二万二千三百人。股金以西南为例，平均每个信用合作社拥有股金二千七百多万元。
    几年以来，各地信用合作社、信用互助组、供销合作社信用部吸收农民大量余款、及时贷给生产和生活上有困难的农户，对发展农业生产，打击农村高利贷起了很重要的作用。西北区信用互助合作组织去年一年来在当地党政机关和人民银行的具体领导下，吸收农村闲散资金达二百零三亿元（股金不在内），放款额达二百多亿元。在贷出的款项中，以解决农民生产和生活困难的贷款比重最大。河南省密县、成皋、新郑、尉氏等四个县的信用合作组织，自成立以来，共帮助农民购买牲畜一千五百多头，大小农具四千多件，肥料十万多斤，购买及修理大小车四百多辆。
    信用合作组织及时贷款解决农民进行副业生产以及灾荒、疾病、婚丧、缺口粮等紧急困难，最受农民欢迎。广东省澄海县南徽乡信用合作社成立一年来，给社员解决了上述各种困难四百多起。陕西省泾阳县北赵村农民赵志林父亲死了，当时没有现款，该村信用合作社贷给他六十万元办理丧事。各地因为有了信用合作组织，农民各种急需的小款借贷都能及时解决，手续简便，很多地方的农民称信用合作社是他们的小银行，可以救急救难。
    有些地方的信用合作社注意和农业生产互助合作组织密切联系，更好地为生产服务。四川省三台县古井乡信用合作社和生产互助组签定了“储贷合同”，根据社员生产需要，采取伙贷伙用或伙贷分用方法开展业务，促进了生产互助组发展生产，也巩固了信用合作社。河南省济源县十一个信用合作社在一个季度内，就贷款帮助了一百七十五个农业生产互助组解决了缺乏生产资料的困难。
    有些地区的信用合作社和生产互助组、供销合作社订立三角联系合同，效果也很好。陕西省长安县张旺渠村信用合作社和供销合作社以及该村互助组和部分单干农民共一百八十三户，在去年春订立三角联系合同，生产芦席九千八百张，由供销合作社负责原料供应和成品推销，信用合作社负责调剂资金，这样不但解决了一百八十三户农民的口粮问题，并添置了耕畜七头和手推车十辆。
