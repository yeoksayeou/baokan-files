　　My Opinions on Carrying Out Agricultural Scientific Research
    Sun Qu, Deputy Academic Dean of Beijing Agricultural University

    In order to improve agricultural production, in addition to relying on the leadership of the Party and the People's Government and the production enthusiasm of the peasants, it is also necessary to rely on the continuous improvement of agricultural scientific research.

    In our country, although there are many agricultural scientific research institutions of various sizes, they are still insufficient compared with the actual needs, and the level of scientific research is not very high. Therefore, how to give play to the strength of scientific workers engaged in education in higher agricultural schools is a problem worthy of attention. Soviet Union's teachers in higher education have rich experience in cooperating with national construction and coordinating with the Academy of Sciences in scientific research. In addition to striving to do a good job in teaching, Soviet Union's teachers in higher education also conduct scientific research in a planned way. They believe that doing a good job in scientific research will not only play a huge role in national construction, but also is a basic link in continuously improving the quality of teaching. Soviet Union's experience proves that teaching work must be based on scientific research work, otherwise, the training of skilled technical personnel is unimaginable. This is indeed the case.

    Before liberation, agricultural scientific researchers in our country also conducted some scientific research work in agricultural production, and the research time was not short. However, there was not much achievement. This is mainly because the corrupt social system suppressed the development of science, but it is undeniable that there are also serious shortcomings in the research work itself.

    What to study? Why study? Many of our agricultural scientific researchers have always been unclear about this. In the past, many people chose research topics based on their own interests or curiosity; some people even carried out work in accordance with the will of capitalists, rarely starting from the actual needs of the masses. The result is at most writing a paper and publishing it in a magazine. Because this kind of scientific research lacks the practical foundation of the masses, it neither helps practical work nor improves the quality of teaching.

    Where can we find our research object? Simply put, there is only one method, that is, going deep into production and contacting reality. Only by going to the production of the masses can we understand the demands of the masses; only by gaining inspiration from the rich experience of the broad masses can we solve the problems of the masses in a timely and correct manner and meet the needs of the masses. Of course, it is also difficult to allow school teachers to conduct scientific research work in this way. Because the task of school teachers is first to do a good job in teaching, and to do a good job in teaching, they must take a certain amount of time. However, this does not mean that there is no time to do scientific research work. Teaching practice, teaching production practice, and production practice in schools are all good opportunities to go deep into the site and contact reality. If we can carefully observe and experience, it is also possible to discover research objects. Of course, we can also find research objects from existing survey data or from business departments.

    Having a research object, we must also have a correct research method. In the past, we also grasped many problems that were critical in production as research topics, such as the problem of moisture conservation in North China, the problem of irrigation, etc. But the results of the research were not satisfactory. Why? The main reason is that we have not mastered the correct research methods. The research method we are talking about now should not only be limited to the experimental stage (this is only one stage in the research process), it should also include various investigations, analysis, and research work done beforehand. Only after we have clarified all aspects of the problem, that is, what are the conditions, what are the bases, what are the main ones, what are the secondary ones, what are the basic ones, what are the derivatives, and what valuable experience do the peasants have in this regard, can we find the essence of the problem and the correct way to solve it. Lysenko cultivated two new varieties in three years. Beforehand, he confidently made predictions in newspapers, and the results proved that his predictions were correct. This is because he grasped the key to the problem, rather than blindly groping and "leaving it to fate." In the past, when we did experimental research, we rarely conducted careful investigation, analysis, and research from all relevant aspects beforehand, but just circled around the problem itself, so there was little achievement. For example, in the fertilizer experiment research I participated in in the past, I rarely analyzed the local climate, cropping system, and natural conditions of the soil, etc., but only used a large amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium chemical fertilizers in different proportions to see which proportion of chemical fertilizers had the highest crop yield after application, and then affirmed the effect of that research. This kind of isolated and one-sided research method, which only relies on the highest yield and does not carefully observe the field during the experiment, even if it grasps the key problems in production, it is difficult to draw a correct conclusion. Therefore, scientists in capitalist countries often describe the difficulty and uncertainty of scientific research work as finding a needle in a haystack. Indeed, for them, it is like finding a needle in a haystack.

    To achieve clear research objectives and correct research methods, we must continuously improve our Marxist-Leninist theoretical level. The reason why Soviet science has developed so rapidly is precisely because Soviet scientists have mastered the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and correctly applied them to scientific research work. Academician Lysenko said when talking about the great achievements of Soviet science: "It can only be explained in this way, that is, we have every possibility to master and study dialectical materialism." Williams also called on all scientific workers to master Marxism-Leninism. Because Marxism-Leninism is a "universal truth" that "applies everywhere," it is the key to solving all problems. Therefore, Soviet universities, whether in engineering, agriculture, medicine, science, literature, or law, all list Marxism-Leninism as a compulsory course; and the national examination also takes it as a special subject examination. All this clearly tells us that to carry out scientific research work, we must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism.

### 我对开展农业科学研究工作的意见

　　我对开展农业科学研究工作的意见
    北京农业大学副教务长　孙　渠
    提高农业生产，除了倚靠党和人民政府的领导，倚靠农民的生产积极性以外，还必须倚靠农业科学研究工作的不断提高。
    在我国，虽然也有不少大大小小的农业科学研究机构，但和现实的需要比较起来，仍是不够的，而且科学研究的水平也不太高；因此，怎样发挥在高等农业学校里从事教育工作的科学工作者的力量，是很值得注意的一个问题。苏联高等学校的教师在配合国家建设、协同科学院进行科学研究工作上是有丰富经验的。苏联高等学校的教师，除了努力搞好教学工作以外，同时也有计划地进行科学研究工作。他们认为，搞好科学研究工作，不仅对国家建设将起极大的作用，而且是不断提高教学质量的基本环节。苏联的经验证明：教学工作必须建立在科学研究工作的基础上，否则，熟练技术的专门人才的培养是不能设想的。事实也正是这样。
    解放以前，我国农业科学研究工作者在农业生产方面也曾作过一些科学研究工作的，研究的时间也并不算短；但是，没有多大成就。这主要是由于腐朽的社会制度抑止着科学的发展，但也不容否认，研究工作本身也存在着严重的缺点。
    研究什么？为什么研究？在我们农业科学研究工作者当中，有许多人一直是不明确的。过去，有许多人只是按着自己的兴趣，或者是好奇的心理去选择研究题目；有些人甚至是在遵照着资本家的意旨去进行工作，很少从群众的实际需要出发。其结果最多不过写一篇论文，在杂志上登登。因为这种科学研究工作缺乏群众的实践基础，所以它既无助于实际工作，也无补于教学质量的提高。
    从那里去找我们的研究对象呢？简单地说，只有一个方法，即深入生产，接触实际。只有到群众的生产中去，才能了解群众的要求；只有从广大群众的丰富经验中得到启示，才能及时地、正确地解决群众的疑难，满足群众的要求。当然，要让学校教师这样地进行科学研究工作也是有困难的。因为学校教师的任务，首先是搞好教学，而想搞好教学，就必须拿出一定的时间。然而，这并不是说就没有时间去作科学研究工作了。学校里的教学实习、教学生产实习和生产实习，都是深入现场、接触实际的好机会，如果我们能细心地去观察、体验，同样是有可能发现研究的对象的。当然，我们也可以从已有的调查资料中或到业务部门去寻找研究的对象。
    有了研究的对象，还必须有正确的研究方法。过去我们也曾抓住不少在生产方面是带有关键性的问题，作为研究的题目，例如华北的保墒问题、灌溉问题等。但研究的结果不能令人满意，为什么？主要是我们没有掌握正确的研究方法。我们现在所说的研究方法，应当不只是局限于作试验的那一阶段（这只是研究过程中的一个阶段），它应当还包括有事前所作的种种调查、分析和研究等工作。只有在弄清楚了问题的各个方面，即那些是条件，那些是根据，那些是主要的，那些是次要的，那些是基本的，那些是派生的，以及农民在这方面有些什么宝贵的经验等等，我们才有可能找出问题的本质和解决问题的正确途径。李森科曾经在三年中培育了两个新的品种，事前他曾有把握地在报纸上作过预测，结果证明他的预测是正确的。这就是因为他掌握了问题的关键，而不是“听天由命”地乱碰瞎摸。过去，我们作试验研究，事前很少从有关的各个方面去作仔细的调查、分析和研究，只是在问题的本身打圈子，因此少有成就。譬如我过去参加过的关于肥料的试验研究，事前很少去分析当地的气候、耕作制度和土壤的自然情况等等，只是用大量的氮、磷、钾三种化学肥料，按不同的比例配合施用，看按那种比例配合的化学肥料，施用后的作物产量最高，就肯定那种研究的效果。像这种只凭最高产量，而在试验过程中不去仔细作田间观察的孤立的、片面的研究方法，即或抓住了生产中的关键问题，也是很难得出一个正确的结论的。所以资本主义国家的科学家常常形容科学研究工作的困难和没有把握，好像从草堆里找针一样。确实的，对他们来说，这真是像在草堆里找针一样。
    要作到研究对象明确，研究方法正确，就必须不断提高我们的马克思列宁主义的理论水平。苏联的科学所以发展得如此迅速，正是因为苏联的科学家掌握了马克思列宁主义的基本理论，并且正确地把它运用到科学研究工作中去的缘故。李森科院士在谈到苏联科学的巨大成就时说：“只能这样来解释，即我们有一切可能来掌握和学习辩证唯物主义。”威廉士也曾经号召一切科学工作者掌握马克思列宁主义。因为马克思列宁主义是“放之四海而皆准”的“普遍真理”，它是解决一切问题的钥匙。所以苏联的高等学校，不论是工、农、医、理、文、法等科，都将马克思列宁主义列为必修课程；而国家考试，也把它作为一个专门科目考试。这一切，都明显地告诉我们，要开展科学研究工作，就必须认真地学习马克思列宁主义。
