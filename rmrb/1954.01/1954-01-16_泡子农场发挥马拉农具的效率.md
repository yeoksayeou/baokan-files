    Paozi Farm Maximizes the Efficiency of Horse-Drawn Farm Implements
    Wang Jingqi, Shen Zhezhen, Pan Mingyi
    Paozi Farm in Fuxin County, Liaoxi Province, has a total of 200 hectares of virgin land, six cadres, twenty-seven workers, thirty-two draft horses, two sets of new-style horse-drawn farm implements, and ten combined shovel-cultivators. In 1953, they planted 60 hectares of spring wheat, 71 hectares of sorghum, 47.5 hectares of corn, 17 hectares of millet, 3 hectares of alfalfa, and 1.5 hectares of cotton. With the exception of cotton, all crops were cultivated using horse-drawn farm implements. Each set of horse-drawn implements cultivated more than 99 hectares, achieving the highest efficiency in the use of horse-drawn implements in Northeast China to date. Preliminary calculations indicate that agricultural production in 1953 could yield a surplus of 130 million yuan. The main reason this farm was able to generate a surplus was the efficient use of new-style horse-drawn farm implements. The following are some of the farm's experiences in using new-style horse-drawn implements:

    One, Develop Good Work Plans
    The basic principle of this farm in formulating work plans is to maximize the efficiency of farm implements without missing the agricultural season. The first priority of the work plan is to complete autumn plowing on time. Although the farm has a total of ten new-style plows, due to limited horsepower, a maximum of only eight plows can be deployed simultaneously. If plowing begins in the spring, even if eight plows are deployed every day, calculating an average of 5.5 mu of virgin land plowed per plow per day, it would take until May 1st to complete the 200 hectares of virgin land, and adding land preparation (harrowing, compacting, etc.) would take until mid-June. This would miss the agricultural season. Therefore, in the autumn of 1952, the farm concentrated its efforts on land reclamation, reclaiming a total of 137 hectares. This ensured that the 1953 operations could be carried out according to plan. Based on this experience, the farm formulated its autumn plowing plan for 1953. However, the situation in 1953 was somewhat different from that in 1952. In 1953, it was necessary to both harvest the autumn crops and plow for the autumn. In order to ensure that both tasks were completed on time, the farm adopted a staggered operation method: plowing the wheat stubble before the autumn harvest, and then harvesting, transporting, and plowing simultaneously during the autumn harvest, and finally threshing after the autumn plowing was completed. In order to free up horses for timely plowing, the method of first pulling the sorghum heads was adopted when harvesting sorghum. In this way, only six carts were needed to transport the crops to the field, freeing up horses to pull two sets of plows for plowing. Because these methods were adopted, the farm completed the autumn plowing of 200 hectares of land on time.

    The second priority of the work plan is to develop seasonal work plans. Taking the spring plowing plan as an example, the farm had to complete the plowing of 63 hectares, and the entire 200 hectares of land had to be compacted, harrowed, and dragged once each, while simultaneously sowing 60 hectares of spring wheat and 140 hectares of autumn fields. These tasks were carried out in a staggered manner, and if the allocation of people, horses, and farm implements was not well-managed, it would affect the completion of the entire spring plowing and sowing plan. To this end, the farm studied the characteristics of each operation: spring wheat sowing needs to be done early, and the time is tight; plowing operations require a lot of horses, but the time can be extended. Based on these characteristics, the farm concentrated its efforts on land preparation when the thaw began and plowing was not yet possible. When plowing became possible, it concentrated its efforts on a blitz of plowing combined with land preparation. When it was time to sow wheat, wheat sowing was the priority, and after wheat sowing, it switched back to plowing and land preparation. When sowing autumn fields, due to the drought, the sowing period was delayed, and the time was even shorter. The farm temporarily adopted the method of sowing at night, with people and horses resting but the farm implements working non-stop, and studied methods to ensure the quality of night sowing. As a result, two sowing machines did the work of four, completing the sowing task six days ahead of schedule. In this way, time was fully utilized, the work was well-organized, and the efficiency of farm implements was fully exploited.

    Two, Mobilize the Enthusiasm of Employees
    All employees generally improved their political awareness through training and learning in the winter of 1952 and the spring of 1953. The leadership also changed its past practice of doing everything on its own and improved democratic management. For example, when plowing began in the spring of 1953, each plow did not meet the quota standard. The leadership then studied the issue with the workers and identified the reasons, such as short working hours (late start, early finish, long lunch break), the plowshare's plowing width not reaching the specified width, and unreasonable organization of labor. Once these problems were addressed, work efficiency was improved, and the workload of each plow quickly reached and exceeded the quota standard.

    Three, Raise and Use Horses Well
    The farm leadership takes great care of the horses. The farm manager often educates the workers, saying, "Horses are the power of our farm. If the horses are overworked, the farm's production cannot be done." All thirty-two horses on the farm are well-fed. The breeder, Qiu Shougui, is a labor model on the farm. He adopted the feeding methods of "separate feeding, frequent feeding, and careful feeding." "Separate feeding" means separating horses that eat grass slowly from those that eat grass quickly, and separating horses with old mouths from those with small mouths, thus avoiding the problem of fast-eating animals eating more and slow-eating animals eating less; "frequent feeding" means feeding and watering at different times according to the horses' fatigue and thirst, so that they can be fed in a timely manner; "careful feeding" means ensuring that the feed is clean and fine, so that the horses like to eat it, it is easy to digest, and they are less likely to get sick. In addition, work is assigned according to the lightness or heaviness of the task and the strength of the horses. At the same time, a responsibility system for the use of livestock has also been established. As a result, the farm has never been affected by livestock problems.

    Four, Manage and Use Farm Implements Well
    This farm is very conscientious in the inspection, maintenance, storage, and use of farm implements. The farm has a farm implement technician who is often responsible for guiding the inspection and use of farm implements. Before each operation begins, the farm implements must be inspected. During the operation, spare parts are also brought along, and if the machine breaks down, it is repaired at any time, without delaying production. The farm implements are all handled by workers who are active in their work and have good skills. At the same time, a responsibility system, a handover system, and a farm implement damage and loss register have also been established, so that responsibilities are clear and merits and demerits are clear. These practices have maximized the efficiency of farm implements and increased yields.

    泡子农场发挥马拉农具的效率
    王竞琦　沈哲铨　潘明义
    辽西省阜新县泡子农场共有二百垧生荒地，六个干部，二十七个工人，三十二匹耕马，两套新式马拉农具，和十台综合号铲?机。一九五三年种了六十垧春小麦，七十一垧高粱，四十七垧半玉米，十七垧谷子，三垧苜蓿，一垧半棉花。除棉花外，全部是使用马拉农具耕作的。每套马拉农具种地九十九垧多，达到了目前东北各地使用马拉农具的最高效率。初步计算，一九五三年农业生产可盈余一亿三千万元。这个农场所以能够作到有盈余，主要是发挥了新式马拉农具的效率。下面是这个农场使用新式马拉农具的几点经验：
      一、订好作业计划
    这个农场制定作业计划的基本原则是充分发挥农具效率，不误农时。作业计划的第一个重点是按时完成秋翻地。这个农场虽然共有十台新式犁，但因马力有限，最多只能同时出动八台。如果春天开始翻地，即使每日出动八台犁，以每台每日平均开荒五亩半计算，也要到五月一日才能把二百垧生荒开完，加上整地（耙、镇压等作业）就要到六月中旬了。这样就错过了农时。因此，一九五二年秋天这个农场即集中力量进行开荒，共抢开了一百三十七垧。这就保证了一九五三年的作业能够按计划进行。根据这个经验，这个农场又制定了一九五三年的秋翻地计划。但一九五三年和一九五二年的情况有些不同。一九五三年是既要秋收，又要秋翻。农场为了使两种工作都能按时完成，采取了交错作业的方法：就是在秋收前翻完麦茬，秋收中间边收、边拉、边翻，秋收后全力翻秋茬，翻完再打。为了抽出马匹及时翻地，割高粱时采用先拉穗的办法。这样只要有六台车就可以把庄稼拉到场上，可以省出马匹套两付犁进行翻地。因为采用了这些办法，这个农场就按时完成了二百垧地的秋翻工作。
    作业计划的第二个重点，是做好季节的作业计划。以春耕计划为例，这个农场一九五三年春耕中间要完成翻地六十三垧，二百垧土地全部要镇压、耙、拖各一遍，同时要播种春小麦六十垧和秋田一百四十垧。这些作业是交错进行的，人、马、农具如果支配不好，就要影响整个春耕播种计划的完成。为此，这个农场研究了每一作业的特点：春小麦播种要早，时间紧迫；翻地作业用马很多，但时间可以拖长些。根据这些特点，农场在开始化冻尚不能翻地时，就集中力量整地，到能下犁时，就集中力量突击翻地结合整地，到麦播时以麦播为主，麦播后又转为翻地和整地。播秋田时，由于天旱，播种期拖后，时间更加短促，农场就临时采取了歇人歇马不歇农具的夜间播种办法，并研究了保证夜间播种质量的方法，结果两台播种机顶四台用，提前六天完成了播种任务。这样时间得以充分利用，工作井然有序，同时也充分发挥了农具的效率。
      二、发挥职工的积极性
    全体职工经过了一九五二年冬天和一九五三年春天的训练和学习，普遍提高了政治觉悟。领导方面也转变了过去的包办作风，改进了民主管理。如一九五三年春天开始翻地时，每付犁都达不到定额标准，领导方面便和工人研究，找出了工时短（上工迟，收工早，中午休息时间长）、铧子翻幅未达到规定宽度、组织分工不合理等原因，提高了工作效率，这样每付犁的工作量很快就达到并超过了定额标准。
      三、把马匹养好用好
    农场领导方面对马匹非常爱护。农场场长常常教育工人说：“马是咱们农场的动力，如果把马累坏了，农场的生产就不能搞了。”这个农场的三十二匹马，都饲养的好。饲养员邱守贵是农场的劳动模范。他采取了“分喂、勤喂、细喂”的饲养方法。“分喂”就是把吃草慢的和吃草快的、口老和口小的马分开来喂，这样就避免了吃得快的牲口吃得多，吃得慢的牲口吃得少的毛病；“勤喂”就是根据牲口的劳累、饥渴程度，分别时间饮喂，这样可以喂的及时；“细喂”就是保证饲料清洁细致，使牲口爱吃和容易消化，不易得病。另外还根据活计轻重，马匹强弱分配活计，同时还建立了使用牲口的责任制，因而农场从未因牲口出毛病而影响生产。
      四、把农具管好用好
    这个农场对于农具的检修、保养、保管、使用都很认真。农场有一名农具技术员，经常负责指导农具的检修和使用。每次作业开始前，对农具都要进行检查。作业当中也带上机器零件，机器坏了，随时修理，不耽误生产。农具都由工作积极、技术较好的工人掌握，同时还建立了责任制，交接制和农具损坏丢失册，使责任分明，功过分明。这些做法，发挥了农具的效率，提高了产量。
