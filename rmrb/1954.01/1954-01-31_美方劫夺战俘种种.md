　　　　　Prisoners of War Looking Gloomy
    According to a January 20th dispatch from Agence France-Presse in Seoul: On the morning of January 20th, the more than 7,000 of our captured personnel who were forcibly abducted to Seoul by the American bandits all looked "gloomy" along the way. Apart from the special agents' triumphant shouting and the American planes' shrill howling overhead, nothing could be heard. When they arrived at the southern edge of the demilitarized zone, they were already an hour and a half later than originally scheduled.
    Even the Associated Press admitted in its report: "They dragged their heavy steps,... their expressionless eyes stared straight ahead... before them lay an uncertain future." The Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who had been persecuted and tortured for a long time by the American, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee special agents were thus deprived of their right to return to their motherland and abducted to the so-called "free world."
    　　　　Bandits Triumphantly Lose Themselves
    After abducting more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the American, Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek gangs immediately became dizzy with triumph. According to American news agencies, U.S. Army Secretary Stevens, who personally came to Korea to direct the seizure of prisoners of war, said: January 20th was "a great day" for the so-called "free world"; Syngman Rhee's "Prime Minister" Baek Du-jin said: This was a "very happy day"; U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also said: "We are very satisfied with this matter."
    They actually felt "satisfied," "happy," and "great" about preventing hundreds of thousands of innocent prisoners of war from returning to their countries, their homes, and peaceful lives. This fully exposed the true colors of bandits. From the words "satisfied," "happy," and "great," we smell how much blood and gunpowder!
    　　　　Such a "Victory"
    According to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on January 22nd: Under the coercion of Syngman Rhee's gang, "only one-third" of the Korean prisoners of war abducted by the American bandits "joined the South Korean army." A South Korean official said that this "unexpectedly small number" had "greatly shocked" Syngman Rhee's gang.
    After the U.S. special agents used knives and wooden sticks to plunder our captured personnel, Syngman Rhee's gang originally hoped to recruit "more than 90 percent" of these people as cannon fodder to capitalize on their aggressive war. However, things did not go so smoothly. No matter how they threatened or enticed them, "70 percent of the North Korean prisoners of war said they would rather be civilians." According to Associated Press reporter You Song, the Syngman Rhee government has decided: "Regardless of whether they volunteer to participate (in the Rhee puppet army)," they will all be regarded as "objects of conscription."
    This is Dulles's so-called "just" "victory."
    　　　　A Boring Scene
    According to United Press reporter Miller: On January 25th, the American bandits colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek gang and used five landing craft to abduct our volunteer army prisoners of war to Keelung Port in Taiwan.
    Miller said that when our captured personnel were abducted to Keelung, some people in the so-called "welcoming" crowd began to cry. Yes, how can every kind Chinese people not feel sad and shed tears when they see their compatriots who have been brutally persecuted by the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits! Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits painstakingly arranged these "welcoming" people, intending to let them cheer for the ugly drama of abducting prisoners of war, but unexpectedly, they ended up in a boring scene.
    　　　　American-style "Freedom of the Press"
    On the day the United States began its abduction of prisoners of war, the Associated Press fabricated a dispatch, stubbornly portraying the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were violently taken away and in great pain as "joyful" and "waving flags and singing." However, on the same day, Agence France-Presse's report exposed the Associated Press's true colors. Agence France-Presse's report said that the abducted Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were "gloomy." A Danish newspaper published the Agence France-Presse report and also published the Associated Press report, but added a subtitle to the Associated Press report: "The American Side's Version." When the head of the Associated Press saw that the lie was exposed, he immediately sent two internal telegrams from San Francisco to his reporters in Tokyo to cheer them up, ordering them to continue to write about the prisoners of war as "joyful" and "waving flags and cheering," and believed that this completely fabricated "description was completely appropriate."
    Who says the United States does not have "freedom of the press"? Isn't this it?

　　美方劫夺战俘种种
  　　　　　战俘愁眉苦脸
    据法新社汉城一月二十日电讯报道：一月二十日上午，被美国强盗劫往汉城去的七千多名我方被俘人员，一路上都是“愁眉苦脸”，除了特务们得意忘形地大喊大叫和美国飞机在上空的刺耳狂啸外，什么声音都听不见。当他们到达非军事区南绿的时候，已经比原定的时间迟了一个半钟头。
    连合众社的报道也承认：“他们拖着沉重的步子，……毫无表情的眼睛笔直地向前望着……他们前面是一个未卜的前途。”被美国、蒋匪和李匪特务长期迫害和折磨的朝中战俘，就是这样被剥夺了返回祖国的权利而被劫往所谓“自由世界”的。
    　　　　强盗得意忘形
    美、李、蒋匪帮在劫走二万多名朝中被俘人员之后，顿时得意忘形起来了。据美国通讯社报道：亲自前来朝鲜指挥劫夺战俘的美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯说：一月二十日，对于所谓“自由世界”说来，“是一个伟大的日子”；李承晚匪帮的“国务总理”白斗镇说：这是一个“非常快乐的日子”；美国国务卿杜勒斯也说：“我们对这件事感到非常满意。”
    使成千成万无辜的战争俘虏，不能回国，不能返家，不能过和平生活，他们竟然感到“满意”、“快乐”和“伟大”，这充分暴露了强盗的本色。我们从“满意”、“快乐”和“伟大”这些字眼里，闻到多大的血腥味和火药味啊！
    　　　　如此“胜利”
    据美联社汉城一月二十二日电讯报道：被美国强盗劫持的朝鲜战俘，在李承晚匪帮的强制下，“只有三分之一的人”“参加韩国军队”。一个南朝鲜的官员说，这个“出人意外的微小数字”，曾使李承晚匪帮“大为震惊”。
    美方特务用尖刀、木棍劫夺了我方被俘人员后，李承晚匪帮原指望至少可以从这些人里搜罗“百分之九十以上”的炮灰，来作他们进行侵略战争的资本。但是，事情并没有那么如意，不管怎么威胁与利诱，“百分之七十的北朝鲜战俘说，他们还是喜欢成为平民”。据美联社记者尤松说：李承晚政府已经决定：“不管他们是否志愿参加（李伪军）”，一律都要把他们作为“征兵的对象”。
    杜勒斯的所谓“正义”的“胜利”，就是如此。
    　　　　一场没趣
    据合众社记者米勒报道：一月二十五日，美国强盗串通蒋介石匪帮，用五艘登陆艇把我志愿军被俘人员劫往台湾的基隆港。
    米勒说，当我被俘人员被劫到基隆后，在所谓“欢迎”的人群里，有些人哭起来了。是的，每一个善良的中国人民，看到被美蒋匪帮残酷迫害的同胞，怎能不伤心落泪呢！蒋介石残匪煞费苦心地布置了这些“欢迎”的人，打算让他们为劫持战俘的丑剧喝喝彩，可是却想不到落了一场没趣。
    　　　　美式“新闻自由”
    美国劫夺战俘开始的那天，美联社捏造了一条电讯，硬把被美方暴力架走痛苦万分的朝中战俘说成“欣喜愉快”、“摇旗歌唱”，可是同一天法新社的报道就把美联社的面目揭穿了，法新社的报道说被劫走的朝中战俘是“愁眉苦脸”的。丹麦的一家报纸刊载了法新社的消息，同时也刊载了美联社的消息，但在美联社的消息上加了一个小标题：“美国方面的说法”。美联社的头子一见诺言被揭穿了，马上从旧金山拍了两个内部电报给它在东京的记者打气，命令他们要继续把战俘们写成“欣喜愉快”和“摇旗欢呼”，并且认为，这种完全捏造的“描写是完全恰当的”。
    谁说美国没有“新闻自由”，这不是吗？
