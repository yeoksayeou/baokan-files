Women Across the Country Are Educated on the General Line

The education on the general line for the transition period of the state has had a significant impact on the broad masses of women across the country. Through the study of the general line, women in various regions have further enhanced their political awareness, recognizing that only by advancing in the direction indicated by the general line can women achieve complete liberation. Currently, they are joyfully responding to the call of the general line with practical actions in various work positions.

In the propaganda of the general line, the local Party committees and local people's governments in various regions have paid attention to implementing the principle of mobilizing both men and women. Under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, women's federations at all levels have conducted in-depth and meticulous propaganda based on the characteristics of women. When starting the propaganda of the general line, the Hubei, Hunan, and other provincial committees of the Chinese Communist Party instructed lower-level Party committees to attach importance to carrying out the propaganda of the general line to women, who account for half of the population, and considered this an important link in making the general line known to every household. Some regions in Liaodong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Henan, Guangxi, Sichuan and other provinces paid attention to relying on women's organizations to convene women's representative conferences, women's congresses, women's symposiums, and so on, to carry out propaganda. Wuchang County, Hubei Province, used the method of "one key to open one lock," carrying out education targeting women of different ages and different economic status in the family. Some women's federations in cities and rural areas also set up temporary nurseries and mutual aid groups, so that women could concentrate on listening to reports on the general line.

The propaganda and education of the general line made the broad masses of women deeply feel, from the comparison of past, present and future lives, that women's demand for complete liberation requires resolutely taking the socialist road. They realized that national industrialization has a close relationship with the vital interests of the broad masses of women. The women of Dongshan Town, Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, unanimously stated that in a socialist society, more women can participate in various labors together with men, which will not only develop production, but also make work much easier. Some women said: By then, cooking will be done with gas stoves and electric stoves, and sewing will be done with machines, and women's lives will be better. Some women said: By then, there will be more nurseries, so women can free up their hands to produce without worry. Some elderly women learned that socialist society takes care of the elderly, and they all said that they would work hard together with everyone, and enjoy the blessings of socialism in the future. Mothers with many children were very happy to hear that the Soviet people love and respect mothers with many children, and said that they would take good care of and educate their children.

After studying the general line, women in various regions understand that in order to realize the general line, they should fulfill their responsibilities in their respective positions. They said: "If you want to eat fresh fish, everyone will mend the net; if you want to build socialism, everyone will pave the road." Many female workers in factories, like male workers, greatly increased their production enthusiasm after studying the general line. Zhang Shuyun, a special industrial labor model in Tianjin, said: We women can only achieve complete liberation in socialist and communist society. Today, we should produce and work with high labor enthusiasm, so that socialist society will arrive sooner. Shi Xiaomei, an old worker at the state-owned Shanghai Sixth Cotton Textile Factory, recalled her painful experience of being whipped when she worked in the imperialist yarn factory while studying the general line, and compared it with the happy life of workers who were liberated politically and economically. She said: "I will put myself into production with the full spirit of a young girl. I will never sit in the train car and watch the scenery, letting others take me to socialist society; I will start the locomotive with the young people and move towards the beautiful and happy socialist society." After studying the general line, Feng Jiji, a female worker at the state-owned Tianjin Bicycle Factory, proposed specific guarantees to overfulfill the production plan. She said: "Today I am still an ordinary female worker, but I must train myself into an engineer who builds socialism in the process of the motherland's transition to socialism." After being educated on the general line, the family members of employees in various regions also realized the responsibility they should assume in the great construction of the motherland. The family members of all employees of the Guiyang Power Plant unanimously believed that: Family members are the rear force on the industrial production front. Doing a good job in housework and supporting their husbands in winning more victories in production, so that their husbands can sleep well and eat well, is to support and implement the general line. Some family members also expressed their intention to encourage their husbands to learn from Wang Chonglun of Anshan Iron and Steel Company who completed four years of production plans in one year, and strive for the early realization of socialism. After studying the general line, many female employees of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives criticized their past thoughts of not being content with working as salespersons, and realized that state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives are an important part of realizing the general line. Therefore, they all expressed their intention to do their work well, strengthen the relationship between urban and rural areas, and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance.

In the propaganda of the general line, rural women in various regions deeply experienced from the oppression and suffering they had suffered in the past that socialism is the road to happiness and capitalism is the road to suffering. Therefore, they all expressed their support for the country's socialist industrialization and the cooperation and collectivization of agriculture. Huang Jiguang's mother actively participated in the study of the general line and publicized it to the farmers in the same village. She said: "The general line is the signpost at the crossroads, it guides people to take the bright road of socialism." Peng Lanying, a woman from Zhushan Village, Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, said: "Women don't have a good life on the capitalist road. When the family doesn't have enough to live on, they can only borrow money. If you borrow one stone, you add five dou. After borrowing for three years, the little girl will be given to someone as a child bride." When many rural women discussed the general line, they calculated the benefits that women had received after liberation, which inspired their determination to move forward in the direction indicated by the general line. They understood the importance of national industrialization and the principle of mutual support between industry and agriculture, and therefore actively sold surplus grain to the state. Wang Honggui's wife in Huzhu Village, Peng'an County, Sichuan Province, used to prevent her husband from selling grain. After studying the general line, she supported her husband in selling more than 1,000 catties of grain, and also led the farmers of the entire Huzhu team to sell more than 10,000 catties of grain successively. In Bishan, Qingchuan, and other counties, due to the attention paid to carrying out the propaganda of the general line to women, the number of grain sales increased day by day. When Gao Wei Township, Qingchuan County, started purchasing grain, farmers sold very little grain. After mobilizing women, the entire township sold more than 15,000 catties of grain to the state in half a month. After studying the general line, women in various regions also actively supported and mobilized their families, relatives, and friends to participate in mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives. Women who directly participated in labor expressed that they would work hard with male farmers to increase grain production.

Many women in education, childcare, medical work, street work, and other positions also actively participated in the study of the general line. They all felt that after studying, the future became clear, their vision became farther, and under the shining of the general line, they more clearly recognized the significance of their work. They unanimously expressed their intention to struggle for the realization of the general line in their respective work positions.

    全国各地妇女受到总路线的教育
    国家过渡时期总路线的教育，在全国各地广大妇女群众中发生了重大的影响。经过总路线的学习，各地妇女进一步提高了政治觉悟，认识到只有照着总路线指示的方向前进，妇女才能得到彻底解放。目前，她们正欢欣鼓舞地在各种不同的工作岗位上，以实际行动响应总路线的号召。
    在总路线的宣传中，中共各地党委和各地人民政府都注意贯彻男女一齐发动的方针，各级民主妇联组织在各级党委统一领导下，又根据妇女特点，进行了深入细致的宣传。中共湖北、湖南等省委员会在开始宣传总路线时，就曾指示下级党委必须重视向占人数一半的妇女进行总路线的宣传，并认为这是使总路线家喻户晓的重要一环。辽东、河北、江苏、湖南、湖北、广东、河南、广西、四川等省的若干地区，注意依靠妇女组织，召开妇女代表会议、妇女大会、妇女座谈会等，进行宣传。湖北省武昌县运用“一把钥匙开一把锁”的办法，针对不同年龄和在家庭中处于不同经济地位的妇女进行教育。有些城市和农村的妇联组织还设立了临时托儿站和互助组，使妇女们能安心地去听总路线的报告。
    总路线的宣传教育，使广大妇女从对于过去、现在和将来的生活的比较中，深深感到妇女要求得到彻底解放，就要坚决走社会主义的道路。她们认识到国家工业化对广大妇女的切身利益有着密切的关系。江苏省江宁县东山镇的妇女们一致表示：到了社会主义社会，更多的妇女可以和男人一道参加各种劳动，不但生产可以发展，做活也要轻便得多。有的妇女说：到那时烧饭用煤气炉、电炉，缝衣用机器，妇女的日子就更好过。有的妇女说：到那时托儿所更多了，妇女们就可以更加无牵挂地腾出手来生产。有的老年妇女知道了社会主义社会对老年人有照顾，便都表示要和大家一齐努力干，将来还可享到社会主义的福。多子女的母亲们听说苏联人民对多子女的母亲都非常爱护和尊重，也都十分高兴，表示要好好爱护和教养子女。
    各地妇女在学习总路线后，都懂得要实现总路线，就应该在各个岗位上去尽自己的责任。她们说：“要吃鲜鱼大家来补网，要建设社会主义大家来铺路。”许多工厂里的女工们和男工人一样，在学习总路线后，生产热情大大提高。天津市工业特等劳动模范张淑云说：我们妇女只有到社会主义和共产主义社会才能得到彻底解放，今天我们就应该以高度的劳动热情来生产和工作，好使社会主义社会早日到来。国营上海第六棉纺织厂老工人施小妹在学习总路线中，回忆了她过去在帝国主义的纱厂中做工时受尽鞭笞的痛苦经历，又对比了解放后工人在政治上、经济上得到翻身的欢乐生活。她说：“我要用年轻姑娘那样饱满的精神投入生产，我决不坐在火车厢里面看风景，让人家把我带到社会主义社会去；我要和青年人一道开动火车头，向美丽幸福的社会主义社会前进。”国营天津自行车厂的女工冯技骥在学习总路线后，提出超额完成生产计划的具体保证，她说：“我今天还是一个普通女工，但我一定要在祖国过渡到社会主义的过程中，把自己锻炼成一个建设社会主义的工程师。”各地的职工家属在受到总路线的教育后，也都认识到在祖国的伟大建设中自己所应尽的一分责任。贵阳电厂全厂职工家属一致认为：家属是工业生产战线上的后方部队，好好搞好家务，支援丈夫在生产上多打胜仗，使丈夫睡好，吃好，就是拥护和实行了总路线。有的家属并表示要鼓励丈夫学习鞍山钢铁公司的王崇伦一年完成四年生产计划的出色的劳动成就，争取社会主义的早日实现。许多国营商业和供销合作社的女职员在学习总路线后，批判了过去不安心营业员工作的思想，认识到国营商业和合作社是实现总路线的重要的一环。因此，她们都表示一定要把工作做好，密切城乡关系，加强工农联盟。
    各地农村妇女在总路线的宣传中，从妇女过去所受的压迫和痛苦中，深刻体验到社会主义是幸福的路，资本主义是受苦的路，因而都表示拥护国家的社会主义工业化和农业的合作化、集体化。黄继光烈士的母亲积极参加总路线的学习，并向同村的农民进行宣传，她说：“总路线就是十字路口的指路牌，它指引人们走社会主义的光明大道。”江苏省江宁县竹山村妇女彭兰英说：“走资本主义的路，妇女没有好日子过，家里生活不够时，就只有借债，借一石，加五斗，三年借下来，小姑娘就给人家当童养媳了。”许多农村妇女们在讨论总路线时，算了算在解放后妇女得到的好处，鼓舞了她们照着总路线所指引的方向前进的决心，使她们明白了国家工业化的重要意义和工农业互相支援的道理，因而踊跃地把余粮卖给国家。四川省蓬安县互助村汪洪贵的妻子过去常阻止丈夫卖粮，在学习总路线后，她支持丈夫卖粮一千多斤，还带动全互助组的农民先后卖出一万多斤粮食。璧山、青川等县由于注意了对妇女进行总路线的宣传，卖粮数字逐日上升。青川县高渭乡开始购粮时农民卖粮很少，发动了妇女以后，全乡半个月就向国家卖出了一万五千多斤粮食。各地妇女在学习总路线后，也都积极地支持和动员自己的家人、亲友参加互助组和农业生产合作社，直接参加劳动的妇女都表示要和男农民一道为增产粮食而努力。
    许多在教育工作、保育工作、医务工作、街道工作等岗位上的妇女，也都踊跃地参加了总路线的学习，她们都感到学习后前途明确了，眼光看得更远了，在总路线光辉的照耀下，更加认清了自己工作的意义。她们一致表示要在自己的工作岗位上，为实现总路线而奋斗。
