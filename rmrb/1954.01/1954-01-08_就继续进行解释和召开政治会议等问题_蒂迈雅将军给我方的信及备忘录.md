Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 7th: General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, sent a letter and a memorandum to Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, on January 2nd. The full text of General Thimayya's letter is as follows:

To the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

(1) The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission instructs me to inform the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers side that the Commission has only been able to implement to a limited extent the procedures for the repatriation of prisoners of war as conceived and stipulated in the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and as determined by the Commission's working rules formulated in accordance with the "Terms of Reference."

(2) The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission must decide in the next few days as quickly as possible on the further steps it should and could take to fulfill its responsibilities. In particular, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission must make decisions on the status and tasks of the Indian Custodial Forces and the identity and treatment of prisoners of war.

(3) The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has described the facts and circumstances in its report submitted to both sides. These facts and circumstances have existed, and most will continue to exist, surrounding the efforts of the Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces to implement the repatriation agreement in fulfilling their responsibilities.

(4) Attached is a memorandum prepared by me as Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This is to enable you to understand and study the situation regarding the more important issues facing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces.

(5) The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission requests the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers side to assist the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in making careful, fair, and correct decisions on the following issues:

    (A) Does the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers side consider it possible to continue explanations?

    (B) Is a political conference likely to be convened as envisaged in paragraph 11 of the "Terms of Reference"?

    (C) Given that the political conference has not yet been convened, will the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers side be able to immediately negotiate with the United Nations Command side to develop procedures for considering the issue of non-repatriated prisoners of war and all matters arising therefrom?

    (D) Pending agreement on the treatment of prisoners of war, will the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers side agree to the Indian Custodial Forces continuing their current custodial obligations?

(6) The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission requests a reply without delay within three or four days, so that it can make decisions in a timely manner after learning your considered opinions on the relevant issues. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission would be extremely grateful if a reply could be received before January 6th.

(7) The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission wishes to assure the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers side that it is motivated and urged by a sincere desire to implement the repatriation agreement and fully and correctly fulfill its responsibilities in making this request. The same letter has been sent to the United Nations Command side.

        General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission
                          January 2, 1954

Attached: Memorandum of the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission

January 2, 1954

The ninety-day deadline has passed, and the Commission is now in the following situation:

        I. Explanations

      (A) The explanation work has not been completed, and the vast majority of prisoners of war have not even gone through the explanation process.

      (B) The Commission believes that the extension of the explanation period is legal and necessary, but the United Nations Command side cannot accept it.

      (C) The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers side have repeatedly requested an extension of the explanation period both within and after the ninety-day period.

      (D) The majority opinion of the Commission members still believes that explanations should continue.

      (E) However, the wording of paragraph 11 of the "Terms of Reference" is: "Upon the expiration of the ninety-day period of custody of prisoners of war transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the contact of the representatives stipulated in paragraph 8 above with the prisoners of war shall cease immediately..." These words can be literally interpreted as the explanation period ending on the ninety-first day after the transfer of prisoners of war. The United Nations Command side insists on this position and refuses to change it. Explanations can only continue if both sides agree.

      II. Political Conference

      (A) Submitting the issue of the future of non-repatriated prisoners of war to a political conference is mandatory. Paragraph 11 stipulates in this regard: "...the disposition of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated shall be submitted to the political conference recommended in paragraph 60 of the Draft Armistice Agreement..."

     (B) The failure to convene the political conference is not the responsibility of the Commission. The Commission indeed has no ability or qualification to promote the convening of this conference or to replace it with any other institution or arrangement.

     (C) The Commission has the responsibility and the right to raise this matter with both sides and to ask them to state their positions on the following points:

     (1) Will the political conference be convened within the relevant period, and when during this period will it be convened?

     (2) If the political conference fails to convene within the relevant period, the two sides should reach an agreement on further procedures for the treatment of prisoners of war and promptly notify the Commission.

      III. Custody

     (A) As envisaged in paragraph 11, the Indian Custodial Forces' custody of prisoners of war should end on the one hundred and twenty-first day, but this is not explicitly stated. The aforementioned paragraph 11, after stipulating that the political conference should try to resolve the issue of non-repatriated prisoners of war "within thirty days," then stipulates: "During this period, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall continue to maintain custody of these prisoners of war." There is no provision for ending custody here, only a provision for continuing custody during these thirty days. If the repatriation arrangements had been implemented as planned in paragraph 11, and the issue of non-repatriated prisoners of war had been submitted to the political conference, then there would be no need to consider any other interpretations or views on this matter now.

     (B) However, the United Nations Command side claims and reiterates that custody should end on that day, while the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers side have different views.

     (C) Paragraph 11 of the "Terms of Reference" specifies certain tasks that the Indian Custodial Forces should be responsible for within these one hundred and twenty days, as well as other tasks that they should be responsible for within the subsequent thirty days. This can be interpreted as the custodial task ending at the end of one hundred and twenty days, but it can also be interpreted as there still being tasks that do not belong to the custodial task, or tasks outside the custodial task, but the Indian Custodial Forces must remain here until the one hundred and fiftieth day, and therefore have certain powers.

    (D) Regardless of the interpretation, the actual situation is that without the agreement of both sides, the Indian Custodial Forces cannot maintain custody or even remain in this area. The reasons are as follows:

    (1) The Indian Custodial Forces rely on the peaceful situation guaranteed by both sides, and

    (2) Considerations regarding logistical support.

      A. If explanations are to continue;

      B. If the repatriation procedures are to be implemented;

      C. If prisoners of war, regardless of their status, are to remain in the (custodial) area, then continued custody is necessary.

    (E) The custody period is related to the political conference's handling of the issue of non-repatriated prisoners of war, and since this conference has not materialized, both sides are requested to reconsider and examine it.

    (F) The Indian Custodial Forces, responsible for the custodial task, were invited by both sides and undertook this task according to the agreement of both sides.

    (G) India accepted this task in order to promote the purpose of the armistice agreement and implement the repatriation procedures.

    (H) The Indian Custodial Forces can only continue their custodial task if both sides agree; otherwise, the various conditions that form the basis for the Indian Custodial Forces undertaking their task will not exist.

      IV. Dissolution of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission

     (A) The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should cease its functions and declare its dissolution at the end of one hundred and fifty days. The relevant provisions in paragraph 11 of the "Terms of Reference" contain this meaning, but this declaration is also related to the various stages prior to and after the political conference, and the political conference has not materialized.

     (B) Only by agreement between both sides can the Commission continue to exist after the one hundred and fiftieth day. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can therefore only submit this issue to both sides for consideration and agreement.

    就继续进行解释和召开政治会议等问题
    蒂迈雅将军给我方的信及备忘录
    【新华社平壤七日电】中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将于一月二日以信及备忘录各一件送致朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军。蒂迈雅中将的信全文如下：朝鲜人民军最高司令官中国人民志愿军司令员：
    （一）中立国遣返委员会嘱我告知朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面：本委员会曾只能有限度地实施“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所设想及规定的、以及本委员会按“职权范围”所制定的工作细则所确定的关于遣返战俘的程序。
    （二）中立国遣返委员会须在最近几天内尽速决定它为了履行它的责任所应该采取与可能采取的进一步的步骤，中立国遣返委员会特别须就印度看管部队的地位和任务以及战俘的身份及处理办法作出决定。
    （三）中立国遣返委员会在它提交双方的报告中，已叙述了事实和情况。这些事实和情况曾存在过，而且大部分还要继续存在，并环绕着本委员会以及印度看管部队为履行其责任以实施遣返协议的努力。
    （四）附上我作为中立国遣返委员会的主席所拟的备忘录。这是为了使你们了解和研究关于中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队所面临的较重要的问题的情况。
    （五）中立国遣返委员会要求朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面协助中立国遣返委员会对下列问题作出周到、公正与正确的决定：
    （甲）朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面是否认为可能继续进行解释；
    （乙）政治会议是否可能会按照“职权范围”第十一款所设想的那样被召开；
    （丙）鉴于政治会议迄今犹未召开，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面是否将能立即与联合国军方面进行谈判，以制定关于考虑未遣返战俘问题以及因此而起的各事项的程序；
    （丁）在对战俘的处理得到协议之前，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面是否将同意印度看管部队继续其目前的看管义务；
    （六）中立国遣返委员会要求不迟延地在三、四天的时间内答复，以便它能在获悉你们对有关问题的考虑过的意见的情况下及时作出决定。如在一月六日前得到答复，中立国遣返委员会将极为感激。
    （七）中立国遣返委员会愿向朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面保证，它是受到实施遣返协议并充分而正确地执行其责任的诚恳愿望所推动与敦促而作此要求的。同样的信件已送给联合国军方面。
        中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将
                          一九五四年一月二日
    附：中立国遣返委员会主席备忘录
    一九五四年一月二日
    九十天期限已满，本委员会现处于下述情况之中：
        一、解释
      （甲）解释工作没有完成，绝大多数战俘甚至于尚未经过解释手续。
      （乙）本委员会认为解释期限的延长是合法和必要的，但联合国军方面不能接受。
      （丙）朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面在九十天期间以内和以后曾数次提出延长解释期限的要求。
      （丁）本委员会大多数委员的意见，仍然认为解释应予继续。
      （戊）但是“职权范围”第十一款的措词是“战俘的看管移交中立国遣返委员会九十天期满后，上述第八款中所规定的代表们对战俘的接触应即终止……”。这些话从字面上很可以解释为解释期限在接管战俘后的第九十一天终止。联合国军方面坚持这一立场，拒绝加以改变。只有双方同意，解释才能继续。
      二、政治会议
      （甲）将未遣返战俘的前途问题提交政治会议，这是有强制性的。第十一款在这方面的规定是“……未行使被遣返的权利之战俘的处理问题，应交由停战协定草案第六十款中所建议召开的政治会议……”。
     （乙）政治会议之未能召开不是由本委员会负责的事。本委员会也的确没有能力或资格来促成此项会议的召开，或以任何其他的机构或安排来代替它。
     （丙）本委员会有责任和权利将此事项向双方提出，并要求双方说明他们在下述各点上的立场：
     （一）政治会议是否将在有关时期内召开，并在此时期中何时召开？
     （二）假如政治会议未能于有关时期内召开，则双方关于战俘的处理的进一步程序应求得协议，并迅速通知本委员会。
      三、看管
     （甲）按第十一款的设想，印度看管部队对战俘的看管应在第一百二十一天终止，但是没有这样明白规定。上述第十一款在规定政治会议应“在三十天内”设法解决未遣返的战俘的问题之后，接着规定：“在这期间中立国遣返委员会应继续保持对这些战俘的看管。”在这里没有关于结束看管的规定，只是规定在这三十天时间之内应继续看管。如果遣返安排已按照第十一款的计划执行，而且未遣返的战俘的问题也已提交政治会议，那么现在就不必考虑关于此事的任何其他解释或看法了。
     （乙）但是联合国军方面声称而且再次断言看管应于该日终止，而朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面则有不同的看法。
     （丙）“职权范围”第十一款指定印度看管部队在这一百二十天内应负的某些任务，以及在其后的三十天内应负的另外一些任务。这可以解释为看管任务于一百二十天终止时结束，但也可以解释为仍旧存在着不属于看管任务的任务，或在看管任务之外的任务，但是印度看管部队必须在这里留到第一百五十一天，并因此而有某些权力。
    （丁）不管如何解释，这个问题的实际情况是如果没有双方的协议，印度看管部队不能保持看管或甚至留在这一地区。理由如下：
    （一）印度看管部队依靠由双方所保证的和平状况，和
    （二）关于后勤支援的考虑。
      子、假如解释要继续下去；
      丑、假如遣返程序要予以实行；
      寅、假如不管战俘是什么身份都将留在（看管）地区的话，则继续看管是必须的。
    （戊）看管期限是与政治会议对于未遣返的战俘的问题的处理有关的，而此会议并未实现，因此要求双方重新考虑和检查。
    （己）担负看管任务之责的印度看管部队是由双方邀请并按双方的协议而担当起这个任务的。
    （庚）印度接受了这个任务，为的是促进停战协定的目的并实施遣返程序。
    （辛）印度看管部队只有当双方同意时才能继续其看管任务，否则作为印度看管部队担负其任务的基础的各项条件，就不能存在。
      四、中立国遣返委员会的解散
     （甲）中立国遣返委员会在一百五十天完毕时应停止职务并宣告解散。“职权范围”第十一款中的有关规定含有这个意思，但是这一宣称同时是与在此以前而在政治会议之后的各个阶段有关的，而政治会议并未实现。
     （乙）也只有由双方协议后，本委员会才能在第一百五十天后继续存在，中立国遣返委员会因此只能将此问题也提请双方考虑并获得协议。
