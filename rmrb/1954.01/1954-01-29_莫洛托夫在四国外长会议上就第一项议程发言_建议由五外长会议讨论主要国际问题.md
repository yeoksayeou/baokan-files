Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 28th: The Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States held a meeting on the 27th to begin discussing the first item on the agreed agenda: "Measures to ease international tension and convene a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China." Anthony Eden served as chairman.

V.M. Molotov said: At the meeting on the 26th, he had already presented the Soviet delegation's views on issues related to the first item on the agenda and put forward clear proposals. Based on this, Molotov asked the three foreign ministers to express their opinions on the Soviet delegation's views and the specific proposals it had put forward.

Dulles spoke, saying that he believed Molotov's proposal to convene a conference of the five major powers was an attempt to "establish and implement the principle that the five major powers enjoy special rights to handle world affairs."

Dulles insisted that Molotov had defined the role of the five major powers in this way, attempting to use this distortion of facts to diminish the responsibility of the five major powers for ensuring peace and security.

Dulles did this for no other reason than to deny that this Four Foreign Ministers Conference had the right to "study the problems of the entire world."

Dulles said: "The four of us are here to study the German problem and the Austrian problem because we are the four occupying powers. There are no other occupying powers."

Dulles went on to say that if the matter being debated at this conference was the issue of Korea regaining freedom from foreign troops, "then Communist China is naturally an appropriate party concerned." According to Dulles, the United States is seeking to convene a Korean political conference with China's participation. However, the irrefutable fact proves that only the United States is obstructing the convening of the Korean political conference.

Dulles said that, based on the above reasons, "the United States opposes the concept of holding a five-power conference to end international tension."

Dulles continued, saying that, with regard to Asia, the main sources of tension in the Far East were the Korean issue and the Indochina issue. Dulles insisted that China was unwilling to cooperate to resolve the Korean issue, the Indochina issue, or any other Asian issue based on acceptable principles. Dulles said that the five-power solution to the Korean political problem proposed in the Soviet suggestion had already been embodied in the form of a political conference stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Dulles made many attacks on the great nation of the People's Republic of China, blatantly denying China's right to participate in resolving international problems. Dulles finally suggested that no decision be made on the first item on the agenda, but that the conference proceed to the second and third items on the agenda.

Then, Joseph Laniel spoke. He acknowledged that the United Nations Charter gave the five major powers special responsibility for maintaining peace and security; as for China, the difference in regimes was irrelevant. Laniel agreed with Molotov's statement that negotiating with a country and maintaining relations with a country did not mean approving of its existing regime – this was an obvious fact. Laniel went on to say that we are all participating in this conference, which is proof of this. Obviously, Mr. Molotov does not approve of the regime I represent.

However, Laniel said that he did not believe that "changing the number of members of the conference, that is, from four to five, would be enough to guarantee the happiness of the people of all countries and ease tensions."

Laniel insisted that the government of the People's Republic of China was "contributing to the continuation of the Indochina War." Although everyone knows that this statement violates the truth. Starting from his so-called erroneous statement about Chinese intervention in the Vietnam War, Laniel said, "As long as the situation remains as it is today," the French government cannot consider the proposal to convene a five-power conference. He went on to say that if the situation changes, the French government will pay attention to the new situation based on the new circumstances. Laniel also said that Asia now has two problems, namely the Korean issue and the Southeast Asian issue. He said that we have the opportunity to restore peace in Korea by holding a political conference, so the interrupted negotiations must be resumed. Speaking of the second issue, the Indochina issue, the simplest solution is to convene a political conference on the Indochina issue. According to Laniel, "After such a series of partial solutions, a general solution can finally be obtained."

Eden then spoke. He said that the British government did not believe that convening a five-power conference was "the best way to ease tensions."

Eden said, I believe in moderation. If we study the individual problems facing the major powers separately with patience and a willingness to compromise, the world's problems can be best solved and international tensions can be eased. Eden attempted to prove that having the five major powers discuss international issues meant disregarding the legitimate rights and interests of other countries.

Eden pointed out that the situation in Korea and Indochina was the source of tensions in Asia. At the same time, Eden insisted that the government of the People's Republic of China was unwilling to cooperate to solve these problems.

Eden avoided the fact that the United States was obstructing the convening of the Korean political conference. He said that the political conference stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement already had a suitable mechanism for the five major powers to participate in solving the Korean problem.

Eden went on to point out that, in his opinion, the entire issue of disarmament, as well as many other important international issues, should best be discussed in the United Nations. He also said that he believed that if the discussion involved all aspects of international relations, then not only a four-power conference, but even a conference with more countries would not be able to make progress. He suggested that this Foreign Ministers Conference be limited to discussing the German and Austrian issues for which the four major powers have special responsibility. Eden said he hoped to fulfill these responsibilities. He said: "Then we can discuss those other issues that are not the primary task of this conference."

Molotov then spoke. He said that the Soviet delegation proposed convening a five-power foreign ministers conference because it was necessary to discuss three categories of very specific basic issues at this conference. The first category is military issues, such as the issue of universal disarmament, which primarily concerns major powers and has great international significance. The second category is political issues, namely issues related to improving relations between the five major powers, among which improving relations with the People's Republic of China is particularly important. Finally, the third category is economic issues, the issue of developing international trade on a normal basis.

Molotov pointed out that Dulles, Laniel, and Eden only talked about the second category of issues, namely political issues, in their speeches, and did not mention military or economic issues. However, these issues should be paid attention to, first of all, to the issue of stopping the expansion of armaments and to reducing armaments, especially the armaments of major powers. It is right to hope that this conference will take steps that conform to the wishes of millions of people. What millions of people want is to reduce the burden of armaments, stop the arms race, and thereby ease international tensions.

When talking about economic issues, Molotov pointed out the great significance of the following fact: the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries have a total of 800 million people. Molotov went on to say: Now, to some extent, these 800 million people have been cut off from the market with which they once had considerable relations. This certainly does not mean that the foreign trade of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries cannot be developed. Molotov cited figures to prove that despite the many obstacles on the road to developing international trade, the foreign trade of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China has still developed considerably. Molotov went on to say that, however, it is very obvious that those who are unwilling to promote the normal development of foreign trade are also unwilling to promote the easing of international tensions.

Molotov pointed out that only a few countries have isolated themselves from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. And most countries hope to develop trade relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries. For example, India is one of them, and it is happy to expand trade with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries. A French economic delegation is now in Moscow discussing important issues of developing economic relations between the two countries. Representatives of British entrepreneurs have also been to the Soviet Union. Molotov pointed out that these facts show that the Soviet Union has no intention of isolating itself from other countries, and these facts prove that the Soviet Union is willing to develop trade relations with other countries based on mutually acceptable conditions.

Molotov said that a five-power foreign ministers conference would also be of great significance for improving international trade, because these five countries are most interested in the development of trade relations.

Molotov then talked about Dulles, Laniel, and Eden's speeches on political issues. Molotov pointed out that Dulles's statement was untenable. Dulles denied that the United Nations Charter stipulates that the five major powers have special responsibility for maintaining peace and international security. Molotov agreed with Laniel's statement that this special responsibility does not mean that the five major powers have any privileges to make decisions for other countries. Molotov said: If we acknowledge that, according to the United Nations Charter, the five major powers have special responsibility for maintaining peace and ensuring the security of all countries, then we should also acknowledge that there is nothing wrong with these countries frequently discussing international issues.

Molotov said that the Potsdam Conference decided to establish a five-nation foreign ministers conference of Britain, the Soviet Union, France, the United States, and China. Molotov asked: After we all acknowledge that a five-nation foreign ministers conference including China must be established, are we tearing up this decision, or is this decision still valid?

Molotov pointed out that Dulles's statement was not justified. Dulles said that a four-nation foreign ministers conference is necessary and legal because this conference is going to discuss the German problem and the Austrian problem, while a five-power conference with China's participation seems to be illegal and unnecessary.

Molotov also said that Eden had another view. Eden said that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference should discuss not only the German problem and the Austrian problem, but that the German problem and the Austrian problem should be discussed first. Laniel's opinion went even further. He said that we should discuss not only the German problem and the Austrian problem, but also the Korean problem and the Southeast Asian problem. No one is limiting us to discussing only two issues. If we are truly concerned about consolidating peace and easing tensions, this restriction will not be beneficial to the matter.

Molotov continued: We are very clear that now, holding a four-power conference is already a rare thing. As for a five-power conference, some people don't want to hold it at all. What they like most is to hold a three-nation conference. Several three-nation conferences were held last year, and the agenda of these conferences was not subject to any restrictions. At these conferences, European issues were also discussed, and Asian issues were also discussed, but American issues were not discussed. Perhaps this is very logical. Of course, no objections can be raised to four-nation conferences or three-nation conferences if these conferences do not take any measures against other countries. No objections can also be raised to bilateral conferences. For example, we have already agreed to conduct the first stage of negotiations on the atomic issue between the two countries first. In short, the practice in international relations proves that it is always appropriate to discuss various issues according to the requirements of the facts. Molotov pointed out: It is abnormal that China, the only major Asian power among the five major powers, cannot participate in the five-power conference.

Molotov continued: If four countries with a population of 460 million – Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union – work together with China, which has a population of 500 million, then there is no doubt that this will enable these five countries to make more weighty and more authoritative decisions, and will conform to the wishes of the people of Asian countries.

Molotov pointed out that the Soviet delegation's proposal to convene a five-nation conference with China's participation does not mean that such a conference should be limited to discussing Asian issues.

China is a major power that can help solve world problems – not just problems about Asia. China's participation is very beneficial to resolving international issues such as disarmament, agreements on the atomic issue, expanding international trade, and improving relations between large and small countries.

Molotov said: The governments of France, Britain, and the United States stated in identical notes on November 16, 1953, that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference should discuss not only European affairs, but also the issue of promoting the convening of the Korean political conference. The Soviet government replied that this undoubtedly shows that there is a possibility of discussing Asian issues at the Foreign Ministers Conference. Therefore, it is appropriate for the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of these issues.

Molotov summarized the results of the exchange of views at the meeting, saying: The participants in the meeting have not yet reached a consensus on the issue of convening a five-power conference. As I understand it, Mr. Dulles's speech meant that he opposed holding a five-power conference to discuss world issues in general. But I seem to feel that Mr. Dulles believes that it is possible for the five major powers to discuss Asian issues such as Korea and Indochina. In this way, Mr. Dulles is admitting to a certain extent that it is possible for a five-power conference to discuss these issues.

Molotov said: As for Mr. Laniel's opinion, as I understand it, his meaning is: If a five-power conference can help ease international tensions, then it is reasonable to hold such a conference. He also mentioned Asian issues. It can be seen that a five-power conference can play an active role in discussing a certain range of issues. Such a five-power foreign ministers conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China can conduct mediation on issues that are related to all of us, in situations where mediation would be beneficial.

Molotov went on to say that, as I understand it, Mr. Eden's speech meant that he did not have an unalterable opposition to a five-power conference. Molotov said: Therefore, I think we can further exchange views on this issue and stipulate specific tasks for the five-power conference. The Soviet delegation has in the past and still believes that such a five-power foreign ministers conference should discuss the major international issues that the Soviet delegation has already expressed its views on on January 25, as well as those issues touched upon at today's meeting that are particularly related to the situation in Asia.

After Molotov spoke, the chairman said that, as it was already late, he suggested that the discussion of the first item on the agenda be continued at the next meeting.

### 莫洛托夫在四国外长会议上就第一项议程发言  建议由五外长会议讨论主要国际问题

　　莫洛托夫在四国外长会议上就第一项议程发言
　　建议由五外长会议讨论主要国际问题
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十八日讯：苏、法、英、美四国外长会议于二十七日举行会议，开始讨论已获协议的议程第一项：“关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议”。担任主席的是安·艾登。
    维·米·莫洛托夫说：在二十六日的会议上，他已经就与第一项议程有关的问题提出了苏联代表团的观点，并提出了明确的建议。根据这点，莫洛托夫要求三国外长对苏联代表团的观点和它提出的具体建议表示自己的意见。
    杜勒斯发言说，他认为，莫洛托夫所提出的关于召开五大国会议的建议是一个企图“确立并实现一个五大国享有处理世界事务的特殊权利的原则”的建议。
    杜勒斯硬说莫洛托夫对五大国的作用下了这样的定义，企图用这种歪曲事实的办法来缩小五大国保障和平与安全的责任。
    杜勒斯这样做，无非是为了否定这次四国外长会议有权“研究整个世界问题”。
    杜勒斯说：“我们四个人在这里研究德国问题和奥地利问题，因为我们是四个占领国家。再没有其他占领国了。”
    杜勒斯接着说，如果在这次会议上争论的事情是朝鲜从外国军队之下恢复自由的问题，“那么，共产党中国自然也是一个适当的有关方面”。据杜勒斯说，美国正在谋求召开一个有中国参加的朝鲜政治会议。然而无可辩驳的事实证明：只有美国在阻挠朝鲜政治会议的召开。
    杜勒斯说，根据上述理由，“美国反对举行五大国会议来结束国际紧张局势的概念”。
    杜勒斯接着说，谈到亚洲，造成远东紧张局势的主要根源是朝鲜问题和印度支那问题。杜勒斯硬说，中国不愿共同合作，来根据可接受的原则解决朝鲜问题、印度支那问题或其他任何亚洲问题。杜勒斯说，苏联建议中所提出的五大国解决朝鲜政治问题的办法，已经体现在朝鲜停战协定规定的政治会议的形式中了。
    杜勒斯对中华人民共和国这个伟大的人民的国家进行了许多攻击，露骨地否认中国有权参与解决国际问题。杜勒斯最后建议不就第一项议程作出任何决定，而转到第二、第三项议程上去。
    接着乔·皮杜尔发言。他承认，联合国宪章给五大国以维持和平与安全的特别责任；至于就中国来说，政权的不同是无关紧要的。皮杜尔同意莫洛托夫的说法：和一个国家进行谈判，和一个国家保持关系，并不等于就是赞成它的现存政体——这是明显的事实。皮杜尔接着说，我们大家都参加这次会议，这就是一个明证。显然，莫洛托夫先生就不赞成我所代表的政体。
    但是，皮杜尔说，他不认为“改变会议成员的数目，即由四个改为五个，就足以保障各国人民的幸福并缓和紧张局势。”
  皮杜尔硬说中华人民共和国政府“在促使印度支那战争继续进行”。虽然，大家知道，这种说法是违反事实真相的。从他的所谓中国干涉越南战争的错误说法出发，皮杜尔说，“只要情况还像今天这样”，法国政府就不能够考虑召开五大国会议的建议。他接着说，如果情况一旦改变，法国政府将根据新的情况注意新的形势。皮杜尔又说，亚洲现在有两个问题，就是朝鲜问题和东南亚问题。他说，我们有机会通过召开政治会议来恢复朝鲜和平，因此已经中断的谈判必须恢复。说到第二个问题，就是印度支那问题，那末最简单的解决办法就是召开一个关于印度支那问题的政治会议。据皮杜尔说，“在这样的一连串的局部解决之后，才可能最后获得总的解决。”
    艾登接着发言。他说，英国政府不认为召开五大国会议是“缓和紧张局势的最好办法”。
    艾登说，我是相信中庸之道的。如果我们以耐心而愿意让步的态度来分别研究摆在大国面前的个别问题，世界问题就能得到最好的解决，国际紧张局势也就能得到缓和。艾登企图证明，由五大国来讨论国际问题，就意味着不顾其他国家的合法权利和利益。
    艾登指出，朝鲜和印度支那的局势是亚洲紧张局面的根源。同时，艾登硬说中华人民共和国政府不愿合作来解决这些问题。
    艾登对美国阻挠着朝鲜政治会议的召开这一事实避而不谈。他说，在朝鲜停战协定规定召开的政治会议中已经有了五大国参加解决朝鲜问题的合适机构。
    艾登接着指出，据他看来，整个裁军问题以及许多其他国际重要问题最好放到联合国去讨论。他又说，他认为，如果讨论涉及国际关系的一切方面的话，那么，不仅四大国会议，即使数目再多些的国家举行会议，也不能有所进展。他建议，在这一次外长会议上仅限于讨论四大国负有特别责任的德国问题和奥地利问题。艾登说，他希望完成这些责任。他说：“到那时，我们就可以讨论不是我们这次会议的首要任务的那些其他问题了。”
    莫洛托夫接着发言。他说，苏联代表团提出召开五大国外长会议的建议，是因为必须在这个会议上讨论三类非常具体的基本问题。第一类是军事性的问题，如首先关系到大国、并具有巨大国际意义的普遍裁军问题。第二类是政治方面的问题，即有关改善五大国之间的关系的问题，而其中特别重要的是改善与中华人民共和国的关系的问题。最后，第三类是经济方面的问题，在正常的基础上发展国际贸易的问题。
    莫洛托夫指出，杜勒斯、皮杜尔和艾登在发言时只谈到了第二类问题，即政治问题，而对军事问题和经济问题却没有提到。但是，对于这些问题是应该加以注意的，首先是对停止扩充军备的问题以及对裁减军备、特别是裁减大国军备的问题加以注意。希望我们这次会议采取符合于千百万人们的愿望的步骤，是正当的。千百万人民所希望的是减轻军备负担，停止军备竞赛，并从而缓和国际紧张局势。
    莫洛托夫在谈到经济问题时指出下列事实的重大意义：苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家共有八亿人口。莫洛托夫接着说：现在，在某种程度上，这八亿人口已经跟他们曾经一度有过不少关系的那个市场割断了联系。这当然并不意味着苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的对外贸易就不能得到发展。莫洛托夫引用数字，来证明尽管在发展国际贸易的道路上障碍重重，苏联和中华人民共和国的对外贸易仍有了相当大的发展。莫洛托夫接着说，然而十分明显，凡是不愿意促进对外贸易正常发展的人，也就不愿促进缓和国际紧张局势。
    莫洛托夫指出，只有少数的国家把自己和苏联及人民民主国家隔离开来。而大多数国家却希望与苏联、中华人民共和国及人民民主国家发展贸易关系。例如，印度就是其中的一个，它乐意和苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家扩大贸易。法国经济代表团现在正在莫斯科讨论发展两国经济关系的重要问题。英国企业家的代表们也曾到过苏联。莫洛托夫指出，这些事实表明苏联无意和别国隔离，这些事实证明苏联愿意根据互相可以接受的条件与别国发展贸易关系。
    莫洛托夫说，五大国外长会议对于改进国际贸易也会有巨大的意义，因为这五个国家是和贸易关系的发展最有利害关系的。
    莫洛托夫接着谈到了杜勒斯、皮杜尔、艾登关于政治问题的发言。莫洛托夫指出杜勒斯的说法是站不住脚的。杜勒斯否认联合国宪章规定五大国有维护和平与国际安全的特别责任。莫洛托夫同意皮杜尔的说法，即这种特别责任并不意味着五大国有什么特权可以对其他国家作出决定。莫洛托夫说：如果我们承认，根据联合国宪章五大国有维护和平与保障各国安全的特别责任，那么，我们也应当承认，这些国家时常商谈国际问题是没有什么坏处的。
    莫洛托夫说，波茨坦会议曾决定设立英国、苏联、法国、美国、中国五国外长会议。莫洛托夫问道：在我们全都承认必须设立包括中国在内的五国外长会议以后，我们是撕毁了这个决定呢，还是这个决定仍然有效呢？
    莫洛托夫指出杜勒斯的说法没有理由。杜勒斯说，四国外长会议是必须的，是合法的，因为这个会上要讨论德国问题和奥地利问题，而有中国参加的五大国会议则似乎是不合法的，不需要的。
    莫洛托夫又说，艾登却有另外一种看法。艾登说，四国外长会议应当讨论的不仅是德国问题和奥地利问题，不过对德国问题和奥地利问题应当首先加以讨论。皮杜尔的意见更进一步。他说，我们应当讨论的不仅是德国问题和奥地利问题，还有朝鲜问题和东南亚问题。没有人限制我们只讨论两个问题。如果我们真正关心巩固和平与缓和紧张局势，这种限制对事情是没有好处的。
    莫洛托夫接着说：我们很清楚，现在，举行四大国会议已经是很罕有的事情了。至于五大国会议，有的人完全不想开。他们最喜欢开三国会议。去年开了几次三国会议，这些会议的议程没有受到任何限制。在这些会议上，欧洲问题也讨论了，亚洲问题也讨论了，可就没有讨论美洲问题。也许，这是很合乎逻辑的。当然，不能对四国会议或三国会议加以任何反对，如果这些会议不采取任何反对其他国家的措施的话。对两国会议也可以不表示反对。譬如，我们就已约定，首先在两国之间进行关于原子问题谈判的第一阶段。总之，国际关系中的实践证明，根据事实的要求来讨论各种问题总是合宜的。莫洛托夫指出：五大国中的唯一亚洲大国——中国不能参加五国会议，这种情况是不正常的。
    莫洛托夫接着说：如果拥有四亿六千万人口的四个国家——英国、法国、美国和苏联——和拥有五亿人口的中国共同努力，那末，毫无疑问，这就会使这五个国家能够做出更有分量、更有权威的决定，并将符合亚洲各国人民的愿望。
    莫洛托夫指出，苏联代表团建议召开有中国参加的五国会议，这并不是说，这样的会议应当只限于讨论亚洲问题。
    中国是一个大国，能够帮助解决世界问题——不仅是关于亚洲的问题。中国的参加，对于解决像裁减军备、关于原子问题的协议、扩大国际贸易并改善大小国家之间的相互关系这样的国际问题，是非常有利的。
    莫洛托夫说：法国、英国、美国政府在一九五三年十一月十六日内容相同的照会中表明四国外长会议不仅应该讨论欧洲事务，还应该讨论促使朝鲜政治会议召开的问题。苏联政府答复说，这无疑说明在外长会议上有讨论亚洲问题的可能性。因此中华人民共和国参加这些问题的讨论是适当的。
    莫洛托夫总结会上交换意见的结果说：会议参加者还没有在召开五大国会议的问题上获得一致的意见。据我了解，杜勒斯先生的发言的意思是说他反对举行五大国会议来普遍讨论世界问题。但是我似乎觉得：杜勒斯先生认为由五大国来讨论像朝鲜与印度支那问题这样的亚洲问题，是可能的。这样，杜勒斯先生就是在一定程度上承认有可能由五大国会议来讨论这些问题了。
    莫洛托夫说：至于皮杜尔先生的意见，据我了解，他的意思是：如果五大国会议可以帮助缓和国际紧张局势的话，举行这种会议是合理的。他也提到了亚洲问题。可见，五大国会议在讨论一定范围的问题时是可以起积极作用的。这样一个有中华人民共和国参加的五大国外长会议可以在那些与我们大家都有关系的问题上，在调解会有好处的场合下，进行调解。
    莫洛托夫接着说，据我了解，艾登先生的发言的意思是，他对于五大国会议并没有不可改变的反对意见。莫洛托夫说：因此，我认为我们可以就这个问题进一步交换意见，为五大国会议规定具体的任务。苏联代表团过去和现在都认为：这样的一个五大国外长会议应该讨论苏联代表团已经在一月二十五日表示了意见的主要国际问题以及今天的会议上接触到的、特别与亚洲的局势有关的那些问题。
    莫洛托夫发言以后，主席说，由于时间已经不早，他建议下次会议再继续第一项议程的讨论。
