Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 22nd: General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in a letter dated January 21st to Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, refused to continue custody of prisoners of war, resume explanatory work, or await political conference decisions on the disposition of prisoners of war. He also requested that the Korean-Chinese side take over the prisoners of war in the Songgok-ri camp by midnight on January 22nd.

Regarding the resumption of explanatory work and the submission of the issue of un-repatriated prisoners of war to a political conference, General Thimayya stated: "The resumption of explanations and the continuation of custody are only possible if an agreement is reached between both sides. This agreement has not been reached, and therefore, the Commission finds itself rendered powerless to more fully implement the provisions and purposes of the 'Terms of Reference'."

Regarding the continued custody of prisoners of war, Thimayya said that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission "is neither empowered to release prisoners of war nor to declare them civilian status under the present circumstances, and it is even less empowered to continue custody after January 22nd." Thimayya still believes that prisoners of war should be "handed back to the detaining sides for custody as soon as possible before January 23, 1954," and "requests the detaining sides to accept renewed custody from January 20th."

He said he made this request "because I can neither maintain custody of the prisoners of war, nor further implement the 'Terms of Reference,' nor release the prisoners of war. I have also stated that it is not my intention to determine the status of the prisoners of war in any way or to implement their final disposition."

General Thimayya said: "In my letter of January 14th, which I have already mentioned, I stated that, in accordance with the Commission's function and authority to interpret the 'Terms of Reference,' the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission believes that any change in the status of prisoners of war by declaring them civilian status or by any other means requires prior implementation of explanatory work and political conference steps, unless both sides agree on some other steps or practices regarding the status and disposition of prisoners of war. In stating this position, I pointed out that the Commission believes that any unilateral action by either party regarding a change of status or disposition would not be in accordance with the 'Terms of Reference'."

Thimayya said, "You have expressed the opinion that any prisoner of war has the full right to refuse to be forcibly handed back to the original detaining party and to request continued explanation. I have already explained that explanations can only continue with the agreement of both parties. As for the forced handover to the original detaining party for custody, I have informed the prisoners of war concerned that coercion in this matter is not permitted under either the Geneva Convention or the 'Terms of Reference.' Those prisoners of war who have expressed opposition to being transferred have been allowed to remain in the prisoner-of-war camp and are temporarily provided with general protection by the Indian Custodial Forces."

Thimayya concluded by saying, "Based on the above considerations, I earnestly and sincerely hope that your side will consider it advisable to accept the renewed custody of the prisoners of war in the Songgok-ri prisoner-of-war camp before midnight on January 22, 1954. If the handover of custody cannot be carried out in the manner suggested here, I will regrettably be forced to take the only remaining course open to me, namely, to withdraw the custody of the Indian Custodial Forces from the Songgok-ri prisoner-of-war camp."

In a separate letter of the same date to Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, General Thimayya also stated: "While I deeply appreciate your willingness to maintain law and order in the area surrounding the Songgok-ri prisoner-of-war camp and to prevent and control any disturbances and acts of aggression against the site, I must state that I believe that this custody by the Indian Custodial Forces must cease at midnight between January 22 and 23, 1954."

    蒂迈雅将军声明停止看管松谷里战俘营
    【新华社开城二十二日电】中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军在一月二十一日复信给朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，拒绝继续看管战俘、恢复解释工作、等待政治会议对战俘的处理，并要求朝中方面在一月二十二日午夜以前接管松谷里战俘营的战俘。
    关于恢复解释工作、把尚未遣返的战俘问题提交政治会议问题，蒂迈雅将军说：“只有双方之间取得协议，解释之恢复与看管之继续才有可能。这一协议并未达成，因此本委员会发现自己对于更充分地实施‘职权范围’的规定与目的已被置于无能为力的境地。”
    关于继续看管战俘问题，蒂迈雅说：中立国遣返委员会“在目前情况之下既无权释放战俘，亦无权宣布解除战俘身份，更无权在一月二十二日以后继续看管”。蒂迈雅仍认为应“紧在一九五四年一月二十三日之前把战俘交还原拘留各方看管”，并“请求拘留各方自一月二十日起接受重新看管。”
    他说他提出这个请求，是“因为我既不能保持对战俘的看管，又不能进一步实施‘职权范围’，也不能把战俘释放。我并且也说明过，我的意图并不是要确定战俘的身份作任何改变，或者要对他们实现最后的处理。”
    蒂迈雅将军说：“在我所已经提到的我一月十四日的信中我曾说过，即遵照本委员会解释‘职权范围’的职司与权力，中立国遣返委员会认为用宣布成为平民身份或者用任何其他方式的处理来对战俘身份作任何改变，都需要在此以前实施解释工作和政治会议的步骤，除非双方关于战俘身份与处理商定了一些其他步骤或做法。在申述这一立场时，我曾指出，即本委员会认为有关双方的任何一方关于改变身份或处理之任何片面行动，将不符合于该‘职权范围’。”
    蒂迈雅说：“你曾经表示过这样的意见，即任何战俘有充分权利拒绝被强迫交还原拘留一方，并要求继续听取解释。我早已解释过，只有经双方同意解释才能继续。至于说强迫交还给原拘留一方看管一节，我已向有关战俘说明过，就此事进行强迫，不论按日内瓦公约与‘职权范围’都是不许可的。表示反对被移交的那些战俘已被允许留在战俘营内，暂时由印度看管部队予以一般的保护。”
    蒂迈雅最后说，“基于以上考虑，我恳切地与诚挚地希望你方将认为于一九五四年一月二十二日午夜以前接受松谷里战俘营之战俘的重新看管是属于得策，倘不能照这里所建议的方式移交看管，我将遗憾地被迫采取留给我的唯一途径，即从松谷里战俘营撤除印度看管部队的看管。”
    蒂迈雅将军在同一天给朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表李相朝中将的一封复信中也说：“虽然我对你愿在松谷里战俘营周围区域维持治安秩序，防止并控制对该地点任何扰乱和侵犯行动的那一建议深表重视，但我必须声明，即我认为印度看管部队的这种看管必须于一九五四年一月二十二日与二十三日之间的午夜停止。”
