　　Cultural Departments Across the Country Actively Prepare to Carry Out Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Activities

    Cultural work departments across the country are actively preparing for the Spring Festival literary and artistic activities, in accordance with the "Instructions on Carrying out Spring Festival Rural Literary and Artistic Activities to Publicize the General Line to Farmers" issued by the Ministry of Culture.

    In terms of creation and material supply, many literary and art workers and folk artists in various regions are actively creating for the Spring Festival literary and artistic activities. For example, Ma Jianling and Huang Junyao of the Northwest Institute of Opera are going to the countryside to experience life and prepare for creation; the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has organized 57 professional literary and art workers and folk artists to create scripts, drum lyrics, comic dialogues, and clapper talks; Jingyang County in Shaanxi Province also held a symposium for literary and art workers in the county; by mid-January, the Northwest region had completed 48 small-scale creations and 16 songs; literary and art workers in Qinghai Province also created a medium-sized opera "When the Xiangyang River Dries Up." The Shanxi Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau and the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles initiated a Spring Festival literary and art contribution campaign to professional and amateur literary and art workers throughout the province in early November last year. Many local newspapers also regularly publish various singing materials; cultural administrative departments of various provinces, provincial federations of literary and art circles, and local popular literature and art publications have compiled and printed various singing materials into volumes and distributed them to various counties. In order to review creations and introduce programs, the Liaoxi Provincial Culture Bureau convened the province's first drama, music, and dance performance conference from January 11th to 16th. More than 600 cultural work cadres from various cities and counties, as well as playwrights, directors, actors, and folk artists from state-owned troupes, amateur troupes, and private troupes, participated in the performance conference. The performance programs included the dramas "Bianwai Village" and "Red Flag," the Ping operas "Teapot Scheme," "Aunt Yang Seeks a Horse," and "Little Sister-in-Law is Virtuous," the Errenzhuan "Three Chickens," and other folk music and dances. The Hebei Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau also decided to hold mass literary and art observation performances in the province during the Spring Festival, with cities and counties as units, except for disaster areas. It also required that during the performances, a collection and investigation of local folk art forms and programs and mass amateur literary and art organizations be conducted.

    The state-owned drama troupes and song and dance troupes in various regions are rehearsing new programs, preparing to tour factories, mines, and rural areas. The Northwest People's Art Theater and the drama troupes of Anhui, Guizhou, and other provinces will perform "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," the Shandong Provincial Drama Troupe will perform "Dawn Shines on Moscow," and the Hunan Provincial Drama Troupe will perform "In the Face of New Things"; the Hunan Provincial National Song and Dance Troupe will hold a "New Year Music Evening" together with other music groups and broadcast it to the province through the radio; the Ningxia Provincial Song and Dance Troupe has rehearsed eight small programs; the Guangdong Provincial South China Song and Dance Troupe will tour Hainan Island and comfort the People's Liberation Army troops stationed on the coastal defense front. Publicly-owned opera troupes in various regions have also rehearsed a large number of new plays that publicize the general line and traditional plays that express joy and happiness: the Northwest Institute of Opera has prepared plays such as "Liang Chunyan," "Wang Er Sells Grain," and "Happiness Comes to the Door"; the Xi'an Yisushe is rushing to adapt "People Strive for Higher Positions" into a Qinqiang opera; at the same time, cultural administrative departments in various regions are also organizing private troupes to select some better plays for publicity during the Spring Festival.

    While organizing professional art troupes to conduct touring performances, cultural administrative departments in various provinces have pointed out that during the performances, they should establish contact with local mass amateur art organizations, provide guidance in business, introduce better programs, and help them clarify the nature and principles of amateur art activities from the Spring Festival literary and art activities, and improve their artistic level. The Guangdong Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau has also mobilized cadres from various departments within the bureau and the South China Song and Dance Troupe, the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe, and the mass creation guidance group to go to the three regions of central Guangdong, eastern Guangdong, and western Guangdong to conduct key guidance; specifically assist local cultural centers and stations in formulating plans, and as far as possible directly grasp the key points and participate in activities.

    In terms of film screening, in addition to the thirteen films mentioned in the instructions of the Ministry of Culture, various provinces have allocated films that are as relevant as possible to the publicity of the general line for simultaneous screening. Such as the documentaries "Chengdu-Chongqing Railway," "Jingjiang Flood Diversion," and "Be Sure to Repair the Huai River Well," the feature films "Dragon Beard Ditch," "Two Families in Spring," "Zhao Xiaolan," "Northern Shaanxi Pastoral Song," and the translated films "Golden Star Hero," "Donbass Miners," "Happy Life," "Tractor Drivers," "Uzbekistan," "Turkmenistan," etc. Film projection teams in various regions are actively preparing; Liaodong Province will have 33 projection teams go to various counties; Hunan Province will have 27 teams, planning to screen 405 shows, with more than 530,000 viewers; Liaoxi Province will have 25 teams, planning to attract 600,000 viewers. The Anhui Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau also requires all cinemas in the province to carefully inspect and repair projectors and generators before the Spring Festival; during the screening, appropriately increase the number of shows and strengthen contact with factories, institutions, and schools; cinemas with conditions can also set up temporary nurseries.

    Cultural centers and stations in various regions have fully invested in the preparations for the Spring Festival literary and artistic activities, organized all publicity forces, and used various small, diverse folk art forms to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity work. Liaoxi Province can dispatch at least 140 central mass amateur troupes to drive the mass entertainment organizations in various counties throughout the province; Ningxia Province has organized 16 cultural peddlers, each of whom must complete 40 activity days in rural areas; rural amateur troupes, folk artists, rural students, etc. have all organized countless propaganda teams or entertainment groups, becoming light cavalry for the Spring Festival mass literary and artistic activities. The cultural affairs bureaus of some provinces have also requested that, through Spring Festival activities, rural troupes should be rectified, consolidated, and improved with emphasis; correcting the chaotic phenomena in some areas where rural troupes are developing towards specialization, specializing in large-scale plays, forcibly apportioning and abusing, and affecting production.

    Cultural administrative departments in various regions will also publicize the general line in social and cultural undertakings based on the specific situation and conditions of their respective provinces. The Gansu Provincial Museum Preparatory Office will open exhibition rooms for petroleum, the Tianlan Railway, the Baotian Railway, bridges, and culverts during the Spring Festival; the Provincial Library will exhibit pictures at the construction site of the Lanxin Railway; the Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee will hold a small exhibition, arranging ancient production tools such as stone mills, axes, and hoes excavated from the Lanxin Railway in coordination with modern plows, tractors, and other new agricultural tools in sequence, so that the audience can understand the benefits of the country's socialist industrialization from the comparison of backward production tools and modern tools.

　　各地文化部门积极准备开展春节文艺活动
    全国各地文化工作部门，根据中央文化部“关于开展春节农村文艺活动向农民宣传总路线的指示”，积极进行春节文艺活动的各项准备工作。
    在创作和材料供应方面，各地许多文艺工作者和民间艺人，正在积极地为春节文艺活动进行创作。如西北戏曲研究院马健翎、黄俊耀等，已下乡体验生活，准备创作；陕西省文联组织了五十七位专业的文艺工作者和民间艺人，创作剧本、鼓词、相声和快板；陕西省泾阳县并召开了全县文艺工作者座谈会；西北区到一月中旬止，已完成小型创作四十八篇，歌曲十六首；青海省文艺工作者并创作了中型歌剧“向阳河干了的时候”。山西省文化事业管理局、省文联等单位在去年十一月初向全省专业和业余文艺工作者发起春节文艺征文。不少地方报纸也都经常地发表了各种演唱材料；各省文化行政部门、省文联和地方通俗文艺刊物，已将各种演唱材料编印成册，分发各县。为了检阅创作，介绍节目，辽西省文化局在一月十一日至十六日召开了全省第一届戏剧、音乐、舞蹈观摩演出大会，参加演出大会的有各市、县文化工作干部和国营剧团、业余剧团、私营剧团的编剧、导演、演员和民间艺人等六百多人。演出节目有话剧“边外村”、“红旗”，评剧“茶瓶计”、“杨大嫂找马”、“小姑贤”，二人转“三只鸡”及其他民间音乐舞蹈。河北省文化事业管理局也确定在春节期间，全省除灾区外，以市县为单位，举办群众性的文艺观摩演出。并要求在演出期间，对本地区的民间艺术形式和节目及群众业余文艺组织，作一次搜集和调查。
    各地的国营话剧团和歌舞团，都在排练新的剧目，准备到工矿区和农村巡回演出。西北人民艺术剧院和安徽、贵州等省的话剧团，都将演出“春风吹到诺敏河”，山东省话剧团将演出“曙光照耀着莫斯科”，湖南省话剧团将演出“在新事物面前”；湖南省民族歌舞团将和其他音乐团体共同举办“新年音乐晚会”，并通过电台向全省广播；宁夏省歌舞剧团已排练了小型节目八个；广东省华南歌舞团将到海南岛巡回演出，并慰劳驻在海防前线的解放军部队。各地公营戏曲团体，也排练了大批宣传总路线的新戏和表现欢乐愉快的传统剧目：西北戏曲研究院准备了“梁春燕”、“王二卖粮”、“喜临门”等剧目；西安市易俗社正赶排改编为秦腔剧的“人往高处走”；同时，各地文化行政主管部门，并组织私营剧团挑选一些较好的剧目，在春节期间配合宣传。
    各省文化行政部门在组织专业艺术团体进行巡回演出的同时，都指出在演出期间，应和当地群众业余艺术活动的组织取得联系，在业务上予以辅导，介绍较好的剧目，帮助他们从春节文艺活动中明确业余艺术活动的性质和方针，提高艺术水平。广东省文化事业管理局并动员局内各科室和华南歌舞团、广东粤剧团、群众创作辅导组的干部，分别到粤中、粤东、粤西三个地区，进行重点辅导；具体协助当地文化馆、站定出计划，并尽可能直接掌握重点，参加活动。
    在放映电影方面，除中央文化部指示中所提出的十三部影片外，各省已配备尽可能与宣传总路线有关的影片，一齐放映。如记录片“成渝铁路”、“荆江分洪”、“一定要把淮河修好”，故事片“龙须沟”、“两家春”、“赵小兰”、“陕北牧歌”，翻译片“金星英雄”、“顿巴斯矿工”、“幸福的生活”、“拖拉机手”、“乌兹别克斯坦”、“土尔克明斯坦”等。各地的电影放映队正在积极准备；辽东省将有三十三个放映队分赴各县；湖南省二十七个队，计划放映四百零五场，五十三万多观众；辽西省二十五个队，计划争取观众六十万人。安徽省文化事业管理局并要求省内各电影院，在春节前，仔细检查修理放映机和发电机；在映出期间，适当增加场次，加强对工厂、机关、学校的联系；有条件的影院，还可成立临时性的托儿所。
    各地文化馆、站，已全部投入春节文艺活动的准备工作，组织了一切宣传力量，运用各种小型多样的民间艺术形式，进行广泛深入的宣传工作。辽西全省最少可出动一百四十个中心群众业余剧团，以带动全省各县的群众文娱组织；宁夏省组织了十六个文化货郎担，每一个文化货郎担要在农村完成四十个活动日；各地农村业余剧团、民间艺人、农村学生等都已经分别组织了无数的宣传队或文娱小组，成为春节群众文艺活动的轻骑兵。有些省的文化事业管理局并要求经过春节活动，有重点地对农村剧团加以整顿、巩固和提高；纠正某些地区的农村剧团向专业化发展、专演大戏、强摊滥派、影响生产等混乱现象。
    各地文化行政部门也将根据本省具体情况和条件，在社会文化事业方面宣传总路线。甘肃省博物馆筹备处，在春节中将开放石油、天兰铁路、宝天铁路、桥梁、涵洞等展览室；省图书馆将赴兰新铁路工地展览图片；省文物保管委员会将举办小型展览会，把在兰新铁路掘出的石磨、斧、镢等古代生产工具，配合现代步犁、拖拉机等新农具，顺次排列，使观众能从落后生产工具和现代化工具的对比中，明白国家社会主义工业化的好处。
