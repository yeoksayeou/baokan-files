Farmers in Shijingshan District, Beijing Visit Steel Plant to See Large-Scale Industrial Production

More than 360 people, including agricultural labor models, members of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid group members, and active farmers in Shijingshan District, Beijing, visited the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant on January 14.

The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have a deep friendship with the farmers of Shijingshan District. Many workers' families live in the nearby rural areas; and some farmers' children work in the factory. The farmers supply the factory with sand and vegetables needed for production and capital construction in large quantities. The workers also pay special attention to the production of their farmer brothers. When the Wang Fuhai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tiancun held an award ceremony, Wei Liren, the vice chairman of the factory's trade union, went to congratulate them and brought a cow as a gift from the workers to their farmer brothers.

When the farmers arrived at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, they first visited the coking plant. As they walked out of the coking plant towards the iron-smelting plant, Hou Decheng, the head of the mechanization and automation technology improvement group, and others stood on the iron frame of No. 1 blast furnace and waved to welcome the visiting farmers. The farmers watched the tapping of iron from No. 1 blast furnace. At this time, the workers next to the blast furnace opened the tap, and the fiery molten iron flowed out, attracting the attention of all the farmers. In the past, although the farmers had not seen blast furnace ironmaking, iron had been a part of their lives every day, and they were not unfamiliar with it. Now the visiting farmers are all talking about ironmaking. Hu Deshan, an old farmer in his sixties, said excitedly: "Iron is so important! With a lot of iron, we can produce weapons to defend the security of the country, and with iron, we can produce all kinds of machines to help us sow and harvest. Without iron, we wouldn't even have a small hoe. When I see iron, I understand from the bottom of my heart that the working class is truly the leader who will guide us to gradually transition to a socialist society." When the farmers learned that some of this iron would be sent to the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory to make agricultural tools, they were even more excited. Many farmers said with great gratitude: Today, we have seen with our own eyes that the workers have created so much and such great wealth for the country, and they are so closely concerned about the farmers. We farmers must learn from the workers, produce more grain, and produce more vegetables to support the factory and support national industrialization.

After the tour, the workers and farmers held a tea party. Nearly two hundred advanced producers from the factory and farmers held a discussion. Industrial labor models Li Youzhi, Yang Kui, Hou Decheng, the head of the mechanization and automation technology improvement group of the iron-smelting department, and agricultural labor models Liang Gui, Meng Zhaobin, Niu Wancheng, Wang Fuhai, the president of the Tiancun Agricultural Production Cooperative, and others met. Liang Gui said: "Worker and peasant brothers are like close brothers, talking about what's on their minds." Through the discussion, many farmers realized that industrial development is necessary for agricultural production to increase. A young female member of the cooperative, Pi Shuqin, said: "The work of the workers is as intense as fighting on the front line. When we go back, we must run the agricultural production cooperative as organized as a factory."

### 北京石景山区农民到钢铁厂参观大工业生产

    北京石景山区农民到钢铁厂参观大工业生产
    北京市石景山区农业劳动模范、农业生产合作社社员、互助组组员，和农民中的积极分子等三百六十多人，在一月十四日参观了石景山钢铁厂。
    石景山钢铁厂的工人和石景山区的农民有着深厚的友谊。许多工人的家就住在附近的农村里；而附近有些农民的子弟就在工厂里做工。农民们大批供应工厂里生产和基本建设需要的砂子和食用的蔬菜。工人们也特别关心农民兄弟的生产。田村王福海农业生产合作社举行评奖大会时，厂的工会副主席魏立人曾亲往祝贺，并带去一头牛作为工人送给农民弟兄的礼物。
    农民到达石景山钢铁厂后，首先参观了炼焦场，当他们走出炼焦场向炼铁厂去的时候，机械化自动化技术改进小组组长侯德成等，站在一高炉的腰部铁架上，招手欢迎参观的农民。农民们参观了一高炉出铁。这时，高炉旁的工人打开了出铁口，火红的铁水奔流而出，吸引住了所有农民的目光。过去，虽然农民没有见过高炉炼铁，可是在他们的生活中，
  一天也没有离开过铁，铁对他们是不生疏的。现在参观的农民，都在谈论炼铁。六十多岁的老农民胡德山激动地说：“铁，多么重要啊！有了大量的铁，就可以生产武器，保卫国家的安全，有了铁，就可以生产各种各样的机器，用机器帮助我们播种收割。没有铁，我们连一张小锄头都没有。一看到铁，就从心眼里明白了工人阶级真是领导咱们逐步过渡到社会主义社会去的带路人。”当农民们知道了这些铁有一些还要送到华北农业机械总厂去作农具时，更加振奋。许多农民非常感激地说：今天参观，我们亲眼看到了工人给国家创造了这样多这样大的财富，又那样亲切地关心农民，我们农民一定要向工人学习，多打粮食，多生产蔬菜支援工厂，支援国家工业化。
    参观后，工人和农民举行了茶会。工厂中近二百名先进生产者和农民座谈。工业劳动模范李友芝、杨奎、炼铁部机械化自动化技术改进小组长侯德成等，和农业劳动模范梁贵、孟昭斌、牛万成，田村农业生产合作社社长王福海等见了面。梁贵说：“工农兄弟在一块，就像骨肉的亲兄弟一样，谈的都是心里话。”经过座谈，许多农民认识到工业发展了才有农业生产的高涨。年轻的女社员皮书琴说：“工人的劳动真像在前线打仗一样紧张。回去一定要把农业生产合作社办得像工厂一般有组织。”
