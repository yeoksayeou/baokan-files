New Year's Greetings to the People's Liberation Army, the Volunteer Army, Families of Martyrs, Families of Soldiers, Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized and Transferred Soldiers
Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government Xie Juezai

Comrades, commanders and fighters of the beloved Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

Dear comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers:

As the New Year's Day of 1954 arrives, I extend my highest respect and warmest congratulations to you on behalf of the Central People's Government. Thanks to the heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the American imperialists were forced to stop their war of aggression in Korea in July 1953 and sign the armistice agreement, forcing their claws to retreat to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, the position from which they began their aggression three years ago. This is a manifestation of the invincible strength of the people of Korea and China, the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the strength of all peace-loving people in the world. It is the result of your fearless, arduous, and sacrificial heroic fighting for the motherland and for peace. This is something to congratulate you on. Comrades! In 1953, with the end of the period of national economic recovery, a new historical period for the motherland began; similarly, the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea ensured the security of the motherland and enabled the smooth progress of the country's economic construction. The year 1953 was the first year of the implementation of the first five-year plan, taking a big step towards realizing the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The people's lives have gradually improved. Comrades! As long as we think that socialism is happiness, and that this happiness is not in the distant future, but is gradually being realized around us, it cannot but make us think even more of your contributions to the country – the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and the families of revolutionary martyrs, and families of revolutionary soldiers, which is another reason to congratulate you.

In 1953, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers made great achievements in participating in production, participating in work, and striving to study and improve themselves. The number of people actively engaged in labor production and participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations in agriculture and handicrafts has increased. According to statistics from four counties, including Handan and Jize in Hebei Province, the number of families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations has increased from 50 percent the year before to more than 70 percent. This not only improved their own lives and reduced the burden of farming for the masses, but also became an active factor in encouraging the masses to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Many people have become labor models or the backbone of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Some families of revolutionary soldiers said: "My land, in the mutual aid group, yields 30 percent more grain than individual farming, and in the production cooperative, it yields half more grain than individual farming." When they enjoy the fruits of their labor, they not only feel the glory of labor, but also feel that it is even more glorious to respond to the government's call to organize and participate in or stand at the forefront of organizing. In cities, families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers are equally active in participating in production and work. As for revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized and transferred soldiers, whether they participate in militia work, government work, and cooperative work in rural areas, or participate in government work in cities, or serve in factories and mines, they can actively delve into their work and improve their work. Some who originally did not understand technology have now become skilled workers, and even have inventions and creations. Revolutionary disabled soldiers studying in schools can also study with a fighting spirit. Now, a large number of model figures have emerged across the country. According to statistics from six provinces, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, and Beijing alone, there are 837 provincial (municipal) model families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers, and 366 model revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized and transferred soldiers. Their social and political status is improving step by step, and the people respect and love them even more. This is another reason to congratulate you.

The work of preferential treatment throughout the country has also made great progress in 1953. Between the winter of 1952 and the spring of 1953, all localities carried out the work of selecting and commending models of preferential treatment. On this basis, the work of substituting farming was rectified. In many places, substituting farming has been combined with the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In order to help families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers solve their production difficulties and provide them with the conditions to participate in production, many places have concentrated the preferential treatment funds to establish family businesses for families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers. In cities, the work of introducing occupations to them is not only continuing, but also paying attention to educating them in productive labor. New progress has also been made in mobilizing and organizing them to participate in handicraft or other small-scale production. Some cities have transformed these production units into cooperative production or local state-owned production, thus consolidating and developing them. On the "August 1st" Army Day in 1953, all localities conducted inspections of the work of preferential treatment. The Second National Civil Affairs Conference held in October 1953 determined that: "The civil affairs departments must earnestly lead the people to do a good job in the work of preferential treatment, and be earnestly responsible for solving the problems of life and production of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers. Give play to their enthusiasm in politics and production, mobilize and organize them to actively engage in production in accordance with the road of mutual aid and cooperation, gradually establish family businesses, and achieve self-sufficiency in production; or participate in other possible and capable work, and participate in the country's various socialist construction undertakings. Those who lack labor or are in poverty and must be given material assistance shall be given substitute farming or material assistance so that they can also gradually achieve self-sufficiency in production as much as possible." In the future, we will certainly urge civil affairs departments at all levels to earnestly implement the resolutions of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference, overcome the shortcomings in the work of preferential treatment in some areas, resettle those who have not been properly resettled, and move the work of preferential treatment forward.

Comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! Although the Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, the American imperialists' ambition for aggression is still not dead. We must be a thousand times more vigilant, strengthen our preparedness, strive to learn advanced Soviet military science and technology, study politics and culture, strengthen our physique, consolidate and improve the discipline of the troops, build a modern national defense army, consolidate our national defense, and ensure the country's construction. Strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and for the gradual transition of the motherland to socialism in a peaceful and stable environment!

Comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers! Chairman Mao calls on us to gradually transition to socialism, taking the road to common prosperity. We must respond to Chairman Mao's call, conscientiously study the general line for the transition period, and advance in accordance with this line!

Comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers! The people love us and help us because we have made contributions to the people in the past. We must maintain our honor and strive for greater glory! Gain greater love from the people with continuous progress.

Comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers! We must adhere to our positions, and those in rural areas should recognize the importance of agricultural production and the future of rural development, and actively participate in agricultural and sideline production. Those working in factories and mines must strictly abide by labor discipline, strive to delve into their work, master technology, and strive to overfulfill production tasks. Those working in government offices must obey the organization, abide by discipline, improve their cultural and professional standards, and improve their policy thinking, and strive to do their job well. Those who are studying must study hard and increase their intelligence. Those who are recuperating must recuperate with peace of mind, restore their physical strength, and prepare to participate in the country's construction work.

Eternal glory to the revolutionary martyrs! Long live the victory of peaceful construction! I wish you all a happy New Year and good health!

    新年向解放军、志愿军、烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人慰问讲话
    中央人民政府内务部部长　谢觉哉
    亲爱的中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    亲爱的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人同志们：
    当一九五四年元旦来临的时候，我谨代表中央人民政府向你们致以崇高的敬意和热烈的祝贺。由于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇战斗，已经迫使美帝国主义者于一九五三年七月停止了在朝鲜的侵略战争，签订了停战协定，使它的魔爪不能不退到其三年前开始侵略时的阵地——三八线附近。这是朝中两国人民的力量，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，全世界爱好和平的人民的力量不可战胜的表现，是你们为祖国、为和平、不畏艰险、不畏牺牲、英勇战斗的结果。这是要向你们祝贺的。同志们！在一九五三年，随着国民经济恢复时期的结束，祖国的新的历史时期开始了；同样，由于抗美援朝的胜利，保障了祖国的安全，使祖国的经济建设得以顺利进行。一九五三年是第一个五年计划执行的第一年，对于实现国家的社会主义工业化和对农业对手工业对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造进了一大步，人民的生活已逐步提高。同志们！只要我们想到社会主义就是幸福，而这种幸福并不在遥远的未来，而是逐渐实现在我们身边的时候，那就使我们不能不更加想起你们——中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军、革命残废军人和革命烈士家属、革命军人家属对于国家的贡献，这又是要向你们祝贺的。
      一九五三年，革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人，在参加生产、参加工作、努力学习提高自己等方面，有很大的成就。积极从事劳动生产的人，参加到农业和手工业的互助合作组织中去的人都增加了。据河北省邯郸、鸡泽等四个县的统计，革命烈士家属、革命军人家属参加互助合作组织的，已经从前年的百分之五十增加到百分之七十以上。这就不但改善了自己的生活，减轻了群众的代耕负担，而且成为鼓舞群众参加互助合作运动的积极因素，许多人已经成为劳动模范或互助合作组织的骨干。有的革命军人家属说：“我的地，在互助组里，比单干多打三成粮食，在生产合作社里，比单干多打粮食一半。”当他们享用着自己的劳动果实时，不仅感到劳动的光荣，而且感到响应政府组织起来的号召，参加与站在组织起来的前头，是更为光荣。在城市中，革命烈士家属、革命军人家属参加生产和工作，也是同样的积极。至于革命残废军人、复员转业军人，在农村参加民兵工作、政权工作和合作社等工作，在城市参加机关工作，或在工厂、矿山服务，也都能积极钻研业务，改进工作，有的原来不懂技术，现在已经成为技术工人，甚至有了发明和创造。在学校中学习的革命残废军人，也都能以战斗的精神进行学习。现在，全国已涌现了大批的模范人物，只是根据广西、广东、福建、河南、黑龙江、江西六省和北京市的统计，即有省（市）级的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属模范八百三十七人，革命残废军人、复员转业军人模范三百六十六人。他们的社会政治地位一步步地提高，人民群众对于他们更加尊敬和热爱了。这又是值得向你们祝贺的。
    全国各地的优抚工作，在一九五三年也有很大的进步。在一九五二年冬季和一九五三年春季之间，各地进行了评选优抚模范的工作，在这一基础上，进行了对代耕工作的整顿，在许多地方，代耕已经和互助合作运动结合起来了。为了帮助革命烈士家属、革命军人家属解决生产上的困难，使他们有参加生产的条件，许多地方把优抚事业费集中使用，为革命烈士家属、革命军人家属建立家务。在城市，为他们介绍职业的工作不但在继续进行，而且注意了对他们进行生产劳动的教育。动员和组织他们参加手工业或其他小型生产的工作，也有新的进展，有些城市，已经使这些生产单位转为合作社性质的生产或地方国营生产，因而得到巩固和发展。一九五三年“八一”建军节，各地又对优抚工作作了检查。在一九五三年十月举行的第二次全国民政会议上确定：“民政部门必须切实领导人民群众做好优抚工作，对革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人的生活生产问题切实负责予以解决。发挥他们在政治上和生产上的积极性，发动和组织他们按照互助合作的道路积极从事生产，逐步建立家务，达到生产自给；或参加其他可能的和力能胜任的工作，参加国家的各种社会主义建设事业。对于缺乏劳动力或生活贫困必须予以物质补助的，给以代耕或物质的补助，使他们也尽可能地逐步达到生产自给。”我们今后一定督促各级民政部门，认真贯彻第二次全国民政会议的决议，克服有些地区优抚工作中的缺点，安置未安置好的人员，把优抚工作向前推进一步。
    中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军全体同志们！朝鲜停战协定虽然业已签字，但是美帝国主义的侵略野心却仍然不死，我们要千百倍地提高警惕，加强戒备，努力学习苏联先进军事科学和技术，学习政治和文化，增强体质，巩固和提高部队的纪律，建设现代化的国防军，巩固我们的国防，保障祖国的建设。为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，为祖国在和平安定的环境下逐步过渡到社会主义而奋斗！
    革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人同志们！毛主席号召我们一步一步地过渡到社会主义，走大家富裕的道路，我们一定要响应毛主席的号召，认真学习过渡时期的总路线，并依照这一路线前进！
    革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人同志们！人民热爱我们，帮助我们，就是因为我们过去对人民有过贡献。我们一定要保持自己的荣誉，争取更大的光荣！以不断的进步去获得人民的更大的热爱。
    革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人同志们！我们要坚持自己的岗位工作，在农村的，应该认识农业生产的重要和农村发展的前途，积极参加农业和副业生产。在工厂、矿山工作的，要严格遵守劳动纪律，努力钻研业务，掌握技术，为超额完成生产任务而努力。在机关工作的，要服从组织，遵守纪律，提高文化和业务水准，提高政策思想，为做好自己的工作而努力。在学习中的，要努力学习，增长智能。在休养中的，要安心休养，恢复体力，准备参加祖国的建设工作。
    革命的烈士们永垂不朽！和平建设胜利万岁！敬祝诸位同志们新年愉快，身体健康！
