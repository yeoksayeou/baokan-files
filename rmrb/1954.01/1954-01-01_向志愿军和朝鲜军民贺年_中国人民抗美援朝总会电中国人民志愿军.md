    The Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea Sends a Telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteers

    (Xinhua News Agency, December 31st) The Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea sent a telegram to Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteers and all commanders and fighters, congratulating them on the New Year. The telegram reads as follows:

    To Commander Peng Dehuai and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    As we enter the year 1954, please allow us, on behalf of the people of the entire nation, to extend our warm New Year greetings to you and all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    In the past year, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, have waged victorious struggles and achieved the historically significant realization of the Korean armistice. However, since the Korean armistice, the enemy has been doing everything possible to obstruct the convening of a political conference and forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, maintaining the unstable state of the Korean armistice. Therefore, as the New Year arrives, we must continue to maintain vigilance, consolidate the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, to ensure the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement and strive for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

    The people of the whole country are entering the New Year full of confidence, advancing along the road of our country's socialist industrialization under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and under the brilliant light of the general line for the transition period of the state. At the same time, we will continue to deepen the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, strengthen our national defense capabilities, to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean military and civilians who are holding fast to their peace posts, and strive to the end for the common cause of the Chinese and Korean peoples in seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue and defending peace in the Far East and the world.

                Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea

    向志愿军和朝鲜军民贺年
    中国人民抗美援朝总会电中国人民志愿军
    【新华社三十一日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会致电中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀及全体指挥员、战斗员，祝贺新年。电文如下：彭德怀司令员和中国人民志愿军全体指挥员战斗员同志们：
    在这一九五四年到来之际，让我们代表全国人民，向您及全体中国人民志愿军同志们表示新年的热烈祝贺。
    过去一年来，中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军一道进行了胜利的斗争，取得了具有历史意义的朝鲜停战的实现。但是，朝鲜停战之后，敌人一直在尽力阻挠召开政治会议和强迫扣留朝中被俘人员，保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态。因此当新年来临之际，我们还要继续保持警戒，巩固中朝人民的永恒友谊，来保证停战协定的彻底实现、争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    全国人民正满怀信心进入新的一年，在毛主席英明领导下，在国家过渡时期总路线的光辉照耀下，沿着我国社会主义工业化的道路前进。同时，我们将继续深入抗美援朝运动，加强国防力量，来支援坚守和平岗位的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜军民，为中朝两国人民争取和平解决朝鲜问题和保卫远东与世界和平的共同事业奋斗到底。
                中国人民抗美援朝总会
