    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th] The news of the upcoming elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has sparked a new surge of political and labor enthusiasm among the Soviet working people. Workers in many factories in Leningrad, in order to greet the Supreme Soviet elections, began a production competition starting on the 13th. In the steam turbine workshop of the Stalin Metal Factory, workers in the section led by Balagurov decided to complete the assembly of the first 100,000-kilowatt turbine of this year ahead of schedule. Steel rolling workers at the Kirov Factory have already formed work shifts to greet the Supreme Soviet elections, deciding to improve the capacity of the rolling mills and increase steel production to welcome the elections. In Odessa, Ukrainian Republic, the two major events for the Soviet people this year—the Supreme Soviet elections and the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia—are inspiring the labor enthusiasm of workers in factories and enterprises. In these days, the "January Uprising" factory has already produced the first batch of products this year, and the workers' enthusiasm is particularly high. On the 12th and 13th, the production team led by worker Chaiko of the factory completed more than two production quotas. In the Far East region of the Soviet Union, in the city of Khabarovsk, workers in various workshops of the Pervomaisky Car Repair Factory held a meeting after hearing the news of the upcoming Supreme Soviet elections on the radio. The workers believe that greeting the Supreme Soviet elections with new production achievements is a glorious thing for them. The workers in the repair workshop of the factory decided that each quarter they would overfulfill the repair tasks by 5 to 10 percent to greet this grand festival.
