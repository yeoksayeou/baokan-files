North China, East China, and Northwest China Administrative Regions
Actively Establish Agricultural Production Cooperatives
[By this Newspaper] North China farmers are enthusiastically requesting the establishment of new or participation in existing agricultural production cooperatives. The original plan to double the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the region this year is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of the masses. Local authorities have revised their original plans based on the demands of the masses and available conditions. In 1954, the region will establish more than 11,000 new agricultural production cooperatives. Adding the existing 6,200 cooperatives, the total number of cooperatives in the region will reach over 17,000, with participating households accounting for more than 3% of the total number of households in the region.

Currently, in just the four special districts of Baoding, Handan, Zhangjiakou, and Cangxian in Hebei Province, 2,084 mutual aid teams have requested to become cooperatives. In Shanxi Province, over 48,500 farm households are requesting to establish cooperatives. Old cooperatives with well-managed operations, strong leadership, and numerous key members are also being appropriately expanded. Thirty-seven cooperatives, including the Song Luoxue Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mancheng County, Hebei, have already made plans to expand their scale.

In order to correctly implement the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instructions on developing agricultural production cooperatives, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires all localities, after cadres' conservative thinking has been largely overcome and confidence has been established, to pay attention to proceeding from reality and preventing the deviation of being impatient and rash without considering the conditions; to steadily and gradually develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations, but also to resolutely implement this to the end. The North China Bureau's instructions also stated: It is necessary for all localities to focus their main efforts on developing new cooperatives before spring plowing, but it is necessary to prevent the deviation of neglecting leadership of old cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and also to prevent the phenomenon of building cooperatives in isolation from production.

Currently, each county has already trained a group of ten to twenty county and district cadres to lead the establishment of cooperatives. Shanxi Province plans to train 20,000 key members from the peasants who will build cooperatives and teams, and this work is underway. Construction of coops has already begun in some regions. The three special districts of Baoding, Zhangjiakou, and Dingxian in Hebei Province have dispatched a large number of cadres to lead the work of establishing cooperatives. According to statistics from 42 key villages for establishing cooperatives and the two counties of Shahe and Jianguo, 157 new cooperatives have been established and 330 cooperatives are in the process of being established.
[Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th] After the state's publicity of the general line for the transition period and grain purchase work, the enthusiasm of farmers for mutual aid and cooperation in the vast rural areas of East China has been greatly increased. In the old revolutionary base areas of Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui, and in the new areas south of the Yangtze River, many previously unstable agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have now begun to consolidate; some mutual aid teams that had collapsed have now been restored; and the number of individual farmers requesting to join agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams is also increasing. In Heze Special District and 12 counties including Zichuan and Linqing in Shandong Province, more than 3,400 new mutual aid teams had been developed by the beginning of January, and more than 9,000 mutual aid teams had been reorganized. In the three special districts of Wendeng, Laiyang, and Heze, and eight counties in other special districts of the province, more than 2,500 agricultural production cooperatives have been newly established. According to incomplete statistics from Minhou Special District and the three counties of Sanyuan, Nanping, and Nan'an in Fujian Province, more than 130 mutual aid teams have also requested to establish agricultural production cooperatives; the agricultural production cooperatives that were established on a trial basis last year are frequently visited, and the directors of the cooperatives have become the most popular people in the countryside, often being invited to introduce their experiences in running cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics from 17 townships in the four counties of Shaowu, Yongding, Haicheng, and Dehua in the province, more than 250 farmers have recently organized or joined mutual aid teams, and some farmers who had previously withdrawn from mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have now returned to mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. Dabu Village in Yongding County and Huating Village in Changle County, which were originally blank slates for mutual aid and cooperation organizations, have now also seen the emergence of mutual aid teams. The number of farmers in Anhui Province requesting to join agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations is also increasing. According to current statistics from the province, more than 800 mutual aid teams have requested to establish agricultural production cooperatives. In many areas, farmers not only request to organize agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, but also actively request to develop supply and marketing and credit cooperatives. For example, in Donggang Township in Feixi County and Wangxiaozhuang Township in Fuyang County, more than 630 farmers sold surplus grain and voluntarily raised more than 14 million yuan in shares to organize credit cooperatives and credit mutual aid teams respectively. In Xiaomiao Township in Luan County, where there was no supply and marketing cooperative, more than 200 farmers voluntarily collected shares to request the establishment of a supply and marketing cooperative.

The Party organizations at all levels in East China attach great importance to the farmers' high enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation. Based on the farmers' demands and possible conditions, they have all decided to carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement on a large scale this year, and in particular to gradually expand the work of running agricultural production cooperatives on a trial basis. Before the autumn harvest, the number of farm households organized in the region will increase from 47.55% last year to 60%, of which farm households participating in year-round mutual aid teams will account for 45% of the organized farm households; the number of agricultural production cooperatives will increase from 3,301 last year to 10,000. The provinces generally determine to focus on areas with more grain production, economic crop areas, and plains when developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations; at the same time, they are also required to guide farmers in mountainous and fishing areas to gradually organize themselves in a step-by-step manner according to different conditions. Recently, all provinces have specifically arranged plans and steps for developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations and exchanging experiences in running agricultural production cooperatives on a trial basis in accordance with the principle of "active leadership and steady progress." In order to do a good job in developing agricultural production cooperatives, all provinces have begun to conduct key trials and create experiences. Around the Spring Festival, all localities will train cadres and peasant activists to lead the establishment of cooperatives in batches. According to incomplete statistics from six special districts including Chuxian and Wuhu in Anhui Province, more than 2,600 people have been trained. In Zhejiang Province, in addition to the district cadres and township cadres who lead the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives trained by each special district, the Rural Work Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is also responsible for training accountants and technicians for agricultural production cooperatives, and 450 people have now been trained. Linyi Special District in Shandong Province will train more than 25,000 key members and technicians to lead the establishment of cooperatives. All localities in Fujian Province are also equipping or enriching full-time cadres to lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Minhou Special District and the suburbs of Fuzhou City and other places convened representative meetings of mutual aid teams and individual farmers who requested to establish agricultural production cooperatives, and trained key members to lead the trial establishment of agricultural production cooperatives.
[By this Newspaper] The work of developing agricultural production cooperatives has been launched in various parts of Northwest China. Construction of coops had already generally begun in Shaanxi Province in early January, Gansu Province began in early January, and coop construction in other provinces is also expected to start in the immediate future. Based on the actual development of the situation, Northwest China expects to establish more than 480 coops before spring ploughing (totalling more than 790 coops including the original 300 plus coops), with another 200+ to be built after the summer harvest - for a total of 1,000+ expected to be in place this year. With the exception of four autonomous districts in Gansu, the Liping directly administered district in Shaanxi, and parts of Xinjiang province, every county will build at least one coop. Shaanxi will build more than two coops per county on average. Based on the experience of Jiao Jiazhuang with large coops (264 families), the Gansu provincial committee plans before spring ploughing to construct five large coops with 100 families each and one medium coop of about 60 families (Linze County). At the same time as establishing the new coops, the province plans to reorganize the existing 32 coops once, and depending on conditions to expand the Wuwei Jieheba Coop from 32 families to about 100 families. In addition to strengthening leadership of the existing agricultural production cooperatives, Pingluo County in Ningxia plans to select a better district to build several new coops this spring to drive the great development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

With the exception of training in the special districts of Xinjiang including Dihua, which is currently underway or about to begin, the training of coop cadres, coop directors, and accountants has basically concluded in other provinces (cities). It is expected that the entire region will train more than 2,500 people. After the launch of coop construction work, the 18 counties of Weinan Special District in Shaanxi have designated specific individuals to be responsible for leadership, and the district party committee has transferred seven people to form a work team to conduct planned inspections. The Gansu provincial committee has designated more than 40 county party committee secretaries, county magistrates, and department and section chiefs to lead the construction of coops, and has transferred more than 70 district party committee secretaries and district magistrates and more than 500 general cadres to be specifically responsible for coop construction. The Gansu provincial committee also stipulates that these cadres may not be transferred at will without the approval of the district party committee, so that they can work with peace of mind. The Shaanxi and Gansu provincial committees have also instructed all localities that when the grain purchase work is basically completed, the county party committee secretaries and county magistrates should take time to personally study the issue of coop construction; cadres above the department level of the district party committee should also study the experience of coop construction; and the district and county party committees should designate specific personnel to regularly collect materials, study, and solve problems. In order to exchange experiences and study and solve problems in a timely manner, the Rural Work Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee has on the one hand sent work teams to directly help Xianyang County (the key county for coop construction determined by the provincial committee) to carry out coop construction work, and on the other hand has transferred cadres to help reorganize coops with more problems and inspect the coop construction situation.

Although coop construction work has been launched in most areas of Northwest China, according to recent reports, some individual counties do not pay enough attention to coop construction work and have not yet designated specific individuals to be responsible, or have designated specific individuals but have not provided responsible leadership; in some counties, before coop construction, the county party committee did not hold meetings to study and organize cadres to learn, and after the completion of the first phase of work, the county party committee did not conduct inspections and summaries; in some places, some members of mutual aid teams are very enthusiastic, requesting to become coops, and the conditions are already in place, but the county's leadership only simply emphasizes grain purchase work and does not actively lead coop construction work; some counties still have the idea of "waiting for conditions, taking it slow," and do not actively create conditions. The Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently issued several instructions urging all localities to check and correct these phenomena.

    华北、华东、西北三大行政区
    积极建立农业生产合作社
   【本报讯】华北各地农民纷纷要求新建或参加农业生产合作社，全区原定今年增加农业生产合作社一倍的计划，已不能满足群众要求。各地根据群众的要求和可能的条件修改了原定计划。全区在一九五四年将新建农业生产合作社一万一千多个，加上已有的六千二百个社，全区社数将达一万七千多个，参加的农户将占全区农户总数的百分之三强。
    现在只河北省保定、邯郸、张家口、沧县四个专区就有二千零八十四个互助组要求转社。山西全省有四万八千五百多农户要求办社。经营管理已经走上轨道、领导强、骨干多的旧社，也适当扩大。河北满城县宋洛学农业生产合作社等三十七个社，已做出了扩大社的计划。
    为了正确贯彻中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的指示，中共中央华北局要求各地在干部保守思想大体克服，有了信心后，要注意从实际出发，防止不看条件急躁冒进的偏向；要稳步地逐渐地发展互助合作组织，但又要一往直前地贯彻到底。华北局的指示又说：各地在春耕前将主要力量用于发展新社是必要的，但必须防止忽视对旧社和互助组领导的偏向，也要防止和生产脱节孤立进行建社的现象。
    现在，各县大都已经训练了十至二十人的一批领导建社的县区干部。山西省要训练两万建社建组的农民中的骨干分子，这项工作正在进行。有的地区建社工作已经开始，河北保定、张家口、定县三个专区抽出大批干部领导建社工作，据四十二个建社重点村和沙河、建国两县统计，已建成新社一百五十七个，正在建立的社有三百三十个。
   【新华社上海二十五日电】华东区广大农村经过国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传和购粮工作后，农民的互助合作积极性十分高涨。山东、苏北、淮北的老区和长江以南的新区，许多原来不巩固的农业生产合作社和互助组，现在都开始巩固了；一些已经垮台的互助组，现在又重新恢复起来；单干农民要求参加农业生产合作社和互助组的也日益增多。山东省菏泽专区及淄川、临清等十二个县，到一月上旬止，新发展的互助组就有三千四百多个，并有九千多个互助组经过了整理。该省的文登、莱阳、菏泽三个专区和其它专区的八个县，新建立了二千五百多个农业生产合作社。福建省据闽侯专区和三元、南平、南安三个县的不完全统计，也有一百三十多个互助组要求建立农业生产合作社；去年试办的农业生产合作社，经常有人去参观，社长们成为农村中最受欢迎的人，常常被人邀请去介绍办社的经验。另据该省邵武、永定、海澄、德化四个县十七个乡的不完全统计，有二百五十多个农民在最近组织或参加了互助组，过去有些已退出互助组和农业生产合作社的农民，现在又回到了互助组和农业生产合作社。永定县大阜村和长乐县华亭村，原来是互助合作组织的空白村，现在也出现了互助组。安徽省要求参加农业互助合作组织的农民也愈来愈多。据该省目前的统计，要求建立农业生产合作社的互助组已有八百多个。不少地区的农民，不仅要求组织农业互助合作，而且也积极要求发展供销、信用合作。如该省肥西县董岗乡和阜阳县王小庄乡，有六百三十多户农民出售余粮后，自动凑积了一千四百多万元股金，分别组织了信用合作社和信用互助组。原来没有供销合作社的六安县小庙乡，有二百多户农民自动集股要求建立供销合作社。
    中共华东区各级党的组织十分重视农民高涨的互助合作的热情。根据农民的要求和可能条件，都决定在今年要大规模地开展互助合作运动，特别要逐步扩大试办农业生产合作社的工作。在秋收前，全区组织起来的农户将由去年的百分之四十七点五五增加到百分之六十，其中参加常年互助组的农户将占组织起来的农户百分之四十五；农业生产合作社将由去年的三千三百零一个发展到一万个。各省发展互助合作组织，一般确定以产粮较多的地区、经济作物区和平原等地区为重点；同时，也要求根据不同条件，有步骤地引导山区和渔区的农民也逐步组织起来。最近各省都根据“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针，具体布置发展互助合作组织的计划、步骤，和交流试办农业生产合作社的经验。各省为了做好发展农业生产合作社的工作，都已开始重点试办，创造经验。春节前后，各地并将分批训练领导建社的干部和农民积极分子。安徽省滁县、芜湖等六个专区的不完全统计，现已训练了二千六百多人。浙江省除由各个专区训练领导建立农业生产合作社的区干部和乡干部外，中共浙江省委农村工作部并负责训练农业生产合作社的会计和技术人员，现在已训练了四百五十人。山东省临沂专区将训练领导建社的骨干和技术人员二万五千多人。福建省各地也正在配备或充实领导互助合作运动的专职干部。闽侯专区和福州市郊等地，召开了要求建立农业生产合作社的互助组和单干农民的代表会，训练了领导试办农业生产合作社的骨干分子。
    【本报讯】西北各地已经展开发展农业生产合作社的工作。陕西省在一月上旬就已普遍建社，甘肃省于一月上旬开始，其他各省也可于最近开始建社的工作。根据实际情况的发展，西北各地预计在春耕以前，共可办四百八十多个社（连原有三百多个社共七百九十多个社），在夏收后再办二百多个社，今年预计共可达到一千余社。全区除甘肃的四个自治区，陕西的黎坪直属区和新疆部分县外，其余每县至少都可办一个社。陕西平均每县办二个社以上。甘肃省委根据焦家庄办大社（二百六十四户）的经验，在春耕前，拟办百户的大社五个，六十户左右的中等社一个（临泽县）。该省在举办新社的同时，拟把原有三十二个社整顿一次，并视条件把武威界河坝社由三十二户扩大为百户左右。宁夏平罗县除对现有农业生产合作社加强领导外，今春准备选择条件较好的一区再办几个新社，以带动互助合作组织大发展。
    建社干部和社主任、会计的训练工作，除新疆迪化等专区正在训练和即将开始训练外，其他各省（市）已基本结束。预计全区共可训练二千五百余人。在建社工作展开后，陕西渭南专区十八个县已指定专人负责领导，地委并抽调七人，组成工作组，有计划地进行巡回检查。甘肃全省已指定了中共县委书记、县长和部、科长四十多人领导办社，抽出中共区委书记、区长级干部七十多人和一般干部五百多人专责办社。甘肃省委并规定：这些干部不经地委批准，不得随意调动，使其安心工作。陕西、甘肃两省委又指示各地，在购粮工作基本结束时，县委书记、县长要抽出时间，亲自研究建社问题；地委的部长以上干部也要研究办社的经验；地委、县委都要指定专人，经常搜集材料，研究解决问题。为了及时交流经验和研究解决问题，陕西省委农村工作部一方面派工作组直接帮助咸阳县（省委决定的办社重点县）进行办社工作，同时又抽干部帮助整顿问题较多的社和检查建社情况。
    西北建社工作虽然已经在大部地区展开，但据最近反映，也有个别县对办社工作不够重视，至今还没有指定专人负责，或指定了专人而没有负责领导；有的县在建社以前，县委没有开会研究和组织干部学习，在第一阶段工作结束后，县委也没有检查和总结；有的地方有一些互助组的组员热情很高，要求转社，而且条件已经具备，但县的领导方面只单纯强调购粮工作，不积极领导建社工作；有的县仍有“等条件、慢慢来”的思想，不积极创造条件。中共中央西北局最近已几次发出指示，督促各地检查并纠正这些现象。
