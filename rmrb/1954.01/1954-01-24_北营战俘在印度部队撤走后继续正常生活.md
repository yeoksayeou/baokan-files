Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 23rd: After the Indian forces unilaterally decided to leave Songgok-ri on the evening of the 22nd, the POW camp there remained quiet and orderly. When the Indian custodial forces withdrew and left the camp gates wide open, the custodial camp was silent. The POWs all remained inside the camp.

Today, the twenty-one American POWs, one British POW, and three hundred and twenty-eight South Korean POWs have resumed their normal POW camp life as before. At dawn, wisps of smoke rose, as several American and Korean cooks prepared breakfast for their comrades in two kitchens. On a nearby hilltop, POWs could be seen doing morning exercises in a basketball court, wearing sportswear.

By noon, this small custodial camp had practically turned into a sports field. Three American POWs and fourteen South Korean comrades were practicing soccer together, while a group of POWs watched an American and a South Korean wrestle. Thirty yards away, Americans and South Koreans were competing in basketball. On a small hill in the middle of the camp, about fifty POWs sat, enjoying the surrounding sports.

This scene of tranquility and peace is in stark contrast to the way the U.S. side drove tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese POWs to the south like livestock. Three days ago, a large number of U.S. and Rhee military police crowded around the custodial camp area, and the smoke from the fireworks lit by Kuomintang and Rhee Syngman armed secret agents filled the sky. Many POWs tried to escape to the north, but were caught and brutally beaten on the spot by secret agents carrying daggers and clubs.

The wide-open camp gates in Songgok-ri and the POWs' normal life today eloquently demonstrate the humanitarian policy of the Korean and Chinese side to repatriate all POWs. However, in the south of the Demilitarized Zone, armed secret agents collectively drove more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese POWs towards death camps and concentration camps, with barbed wire erected high on both sides, and U.S. Marines and soldiers, tanks and machine guns deployed everywhere. This fact shows the world that the U.S. side's so-called "non-forcible repatriation" is actually an illegal seizure of POWs by armed force.

    北营战俘在印度部队撤走后继续正常生活
   【新华社开城二十三日电】二十二日晚印度部队片面决定离开松谷里后，那里的战俘营中始终保持着安静与秩序。当印度看管部队撤出并把营门大开的时候，看管营中一片静寂。战俘们都留在营场内。
    今天，这二十一名美国战俘，一名英国战俘和三百二十八名南朝鲜战俘又开始了他们和过去一样的正常的战俘营生活。黎明时，一缕缕的炊烟升起了，这是几个美国籍和朝鲜籍厨子在两个厨房里为他们的伙伴做早饭。在附近的小山顶上可以看见战俘们穿着运动衣在一个篮球场上做早操。
    到了中午，这个小小的看管营简直就变成了运动场。三个美国战俘和十四个南朝鲜伙伴一起练习踢足球，旁边又有一群战俘在观看一个美国人和一个南朝鲜人摔角。三十码开外，美国人和南朝鲜人又在比赛篮球。营场中间的一个小山坡上坐着五十名左右的战俘，在欣赏着四周的运动。
    这种安静与和平的景象，与美方把成千成万朝中战俘像赶牲口似地赶往南边的景象是截然不同的。三天前那个时候，大批美李军事警察拥在看管营区的周围，国民党和李承晚武装特务点燃的烟火弥漫着天空。许多战俘想逃向北方，可是被抓了回去，当场遭到带着匕首和棍棒的特务的毒打。
    松谷里的营门大开和战俘们今天的正常生活，雄辩地说明了朝中方面遣返一切战俘的人道主义政策。但是，在非军事区南部，武装特务却把两万多名朝中战俘集体赶向死亡营和集中营，一路上两边都高高竖起了铁丝网，布满了美国海军陆战队和军队、坦克和机关枪，这一事实向全世界表明了：美方所谓“不强迫遣返”，实际上只是以武装力量来非法劫夺战俘。
