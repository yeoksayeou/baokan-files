Xinhua News Agency, Xining, January 15th: Three highways built in the minority areas of Qinghai Province were completed before the end of 1953. Various vehicles loaded with supplies are now frequently traveling on the newly built, smooth roads.

\tThese three highways include the renovated Laoya Gorge section of the Gan (Gansu) Qing (Qinghai) Highway, the reconstructed section south of Lajishan on the Ning (Xining) Gui (Guide) Highway, and the newly built Xun (Xunhua) Tong (Tongren) Highway. The construction project spans over 360 kilometers. These projects were very arduous, with routes passing through many high mountains and ridges, where snowflakes fly all year round. The Laoya Gorge section of the Ganqing Highway has always been called the "appendix" of the Ganqing Highway, with steep slopes and sharp turns, making it prone to accidents. After the renovation, the driving speed has increased by 20%. After the realignment of the Ashigong to Guide section of the Ninggui Road, the distance has been shortened by half.

\tThe construction of these highways has further facilitated the exchange of goods between agricultural and pastoral areas, and supported the economic construction of minority areas in Qinghai Province. The freight cost from Guide to Xining has been reduced by about 30% compared to the past.

    青海省少数民族地区
    修筑的三条公路已经完成
   【新华社西宁十五日电】青海省少数民族地区修筑的三条公路，已在一九五三年年底以前完成。现在新修的平坦大道上，经常有各种满载物资的车辆往来奔驰着。
    这三条公路，整修的有甘（甘肃）青（青海）公路老鸦峡段，改建的有宁（西宁）贵（贵德）公路拉鸡山以南的一段，循（循化）同（同仁）公路是新修的，修建工程全长三百六十多公里。这些工程十分艰巨，路线通过不少的高山峻岭，山上常年飞着雪花。甘青公路老鸦峡段，过去一向被称为甘青公路的“盲肠”，坡陡弯急，很容易出事故，经过改修以后行车速度加快了百分之二十。宁贵路阿什贡到贵德段改线后，距离缩短了一半。
    这些公路修筑后，更加便利了农业区和牧业区的物资交流，支援了青海省少数民族地区的经济建设。从贵德到西宁的货物运费，已比过去降低了百分之三十左右。
