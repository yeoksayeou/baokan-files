Xinhua News Agency, January 24th -- The National State-Owned Commercial Planning Conference convened by the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government on December 10th of last year concluded on January 6th of this year. The conference preliminarily determined the draft of the 1954 State-Owned Commerce Commodity Circulation Plan, Financial Plan, Commodity Circulation Cost Plan, and Labor Wage Plan.

In order to further clarify in the minds of state-owned commercial cadres the basic tasks of state-owned commerce during the national transition period when formulating plans, the conference, in conjunction with the study of the general line, preliminarily summarized the planning work of 1953.

Through the summary, the participating state-owned commercial cadres recognized that actively and correctly organizing sources of goods and sales according to the development of people's production and needs, and expanding commodity circulation, is the central link for state-owned commerce to serve production and consumers, promote production development, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and develop the proportion of the socialist economy; ignoring or relaxing it would be a fundamental error. In the first half of 1953, state-owned commerce did not develop as it should have with the increase in industrial and agricultural production, which affected the production and circulation of commodities, because the cadres' thinking was unclear about the basic tasks of state-owned commerce during the national transition period when formulating plans, and they did not pay enough attention to the central task of expanding commodity circulation, coupled with insufficient estimation of market development and the role of capitalism in the market. It was not until the summer of last year, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, that the tasks of state-owned commerce were clarified, the purchase and sales plan for the second half of the year was expanded, and all employees launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy under the leadership of party and government leaders at all levels, that the above errors were effectively corrected, thereby successfully completing the 1953 commodity circulation plan and profit delivery task.

After summarizing last year's work, the conference focused on analyzing the basic market situation in 1954. The conference believes that 1954 is the second year of the country's first five-year plan. Due to production development and increased people's purchasing power, the total amount of social commodity circulation will continue to expand. The production and sales of most commodities are adapted, but at the same time, the production of a few commodities may not keep up with the growth of needs. This is a phenomenon that is bound to occur due to the forward development of our economy and the increase in people's purchasing power. As the leading role of state-owned commerce and cooperatives in the market is gradually strengthening, the organized market will steadily expand further.

The conference carefully formulated the draft plan for state-owned commerce in 1954 based on the basic market situation in 1954, the tasks of state-owned commerce stipulated by the national general line, and the requirements of the national general plan. According to this draft plan, the total purchase amount of state-owned commerce this year will increase by 35 percent compared with 1953, and the total sales amount will increase by 37 percent compared with 1953. According to preliminary calculations, the total commodity circulation cost for the year will be reduced by 17.53 percent compared with last year.

In order to realize this plan, the conference put forward several specific requirements for all aspects of work in 1954. In expanding commodity circulation, it is necessary to strengthen investigation and research, emphasize planning, and gradually overcome blindness. It is required that all localities, while strengthening the purchase of industrial products and agricultural products, should help cooperatives organize sources of handicrafts, organize the distribution of production materials to the countryside, and supply handicraftsmen with sufficient raw materials, as much as possible to meet the needs of the people, especially the needs of farmers. For various major commodities, state-owned commerce will gradually formulate production and sales balance plans to promote increased production, and formulate policies to make distribution more reasonable and prices more appropriate.

In addition, further improving business management, steadily implementing the economic accounting system, improving allocation and transportation work, strengthening direct transportation, improving warehousing procedures, further improving service attitude, and rationally setting up commercial networks are also important aspects of state-owned commerce in realizing the plan in 1954.

In order to expand commodity circulation, in addition to continuing to closely combine with cooperatives to give play to this powerful helper role, state-owned commerce will also utilize the strength of private retailers and small wholesalers between urban and rural areas. The conference estimates that with the continued expansion of the total amount of social circulation, the private retail sales volume in 1954 will not decrease compared with last year. Because under the brilliant light of the general line, private retail commerce will transform a considerable part into retail commerce of a state capitalist nature under the conditions of state-owned commerce strengthening its leading role in the market. State-owned commerce will continue to develop in wholesale business, but in the development, it will proceed step by step, by industry, by commodity, by region, and by time, according to the degree of stabilizing the market and the needs of the national economy and people's livelihood. For the private wholesalers affected by this, they should be guided to turn to industrial production or change to purchasing goods from state-owned companies at state-owned company prices for urban-rural transportation or retail business, in order to facilitate the utilization, restriction, and socialist transformation of private commerce.

### 根据市场基本情况和国家总计划的要求  国营商业初步确定今年经营计划

    根据市场基本情况和国家总计划的要求
    国营商业初步确定今年经营计划
   【新华社二十四日讯】中央人民政府商业部去年十二月十日召开的全国国营商业计划会议，已在今年一月六日结束。会议初步确定了一九五四年国营商业商品流转计划、财务计划、商品流转费计划和劳动工资计划的草案。
    为使国营商业干部在编制计划时思想上进一步明确国营商业在国家过渡时期的基本任务，会议结合总路线的学习，初步总结了一九五三年计划编制工作。
    通过总结，与会的国营商业干部认识了根据人民生产和人民需要的发展，积极正确地组织货源和组织推销，扩大商品流转，是国营商业为生产为消费者服务、促进生产发展、巩固工农联盟和发展社会主义经济比重的中心环节；忽视或放松了它就会犯原则性的错误。一九五三年上半年国营商业没有随着工农业的增产得到应有的发展，影响了商品的生产和流通，就因为在编制计划时干部思想上对国营商业在国家过渡时期的基本任务认识不明，对扩大商品流转这一中心工作注意不够，再加上对市场发展估计不足，对资本主义在市场上所起的作用估计不足所致。直至去年夏季，在中共中央的正确领导下，明确了国营商业的任务，扩大了后半年的购销计划，全体职工在各级党政领导下开展增产节约运动，上述错误才得到了有效的纠正，从而胜利完成了一九五三年商品流转计划和利润上缴任务。
    在总结了去年工作之后，会议着重分析了一九五四年市场基本情况。会议认为：一九五四年是国家第一个五年计划的第二年，由于生产发展和人民购买力增长，社会商品流转总额将会继续扩大，大部分商品的产销情况是适应的，但与此同时，有少数商品的生产可能出现赶不上需要的增长的现象。这是由于我国经济向前发展，人民购买力增长而必然发生的现象。由于国营商业与合作社紧密结合对市场的领导作用正日益加强，有组织的市场将稳步地进一步扩大。
    会议根据一九五四年市场基本情况和国家总路线所规定的国营商业的任务与国家总计划的要求，认真编制了一九五四年国营商业的计划草案。根据这个计划草案，今年国营商业的进货总额要比一九五三年增加百分之三十五，销售总额比一九五三年增加百分之三十七。根据初步计算，全年商品流转费用将较去年降低百分之十七点五三。
    为了实现这个计划，会议对一九五四年各方面工作提出了若干具体要求。在扩大商品流转中，要加强调查研究，强调计划性，逐步克服盲目性。要求各地在加强对工业品、农产品的收购同时，要帮助合作社组织手工业品货源，组织生产资料下乡，并供应手工业者以充足原料，尽可能满足人民，特别是满足农民的需要。对于各种主要商品，国营商业将逐步拟出产销平衡方案，促进增产，并规定政策，使分配进一步合理，价格更加适当。
    此外，进一步改善经营管理，稳步地实行经济核算制，改进调拨运输工作，加强直达运输，改进出入库手续，进一步改善服务态度，合理设置商业网等，也是一九五四年国营商业在实现计划中的重要方面。
    为了扩大商品流转，一九五四年国营商业除了继续与合作社紧密结合，以发挥这一有力的助手作用外，还要利用私营零售商和城乡之间的小批发商的力量。会议估计在社会流转总额继续扩大的情况下，一九五四年私营零售额比之去年不会有所减少。因在总路线的光辉照耀下，私营零售商业在国营商业增强对市场领导作用的条件下，将有相当部分变为国家资本主义性质的零售商业。国营商业在批发营业方面将继续发展，但在发展中是根据对稳定市场及国计民生需要的程度，分行业、分商品、分地区、分时间有步骤地前进。对由此而影响到的私营批发商，应指导其转向工业生产或改向国营公司批购商品，遵照国营公司牌价进行城乡贩运或经营零售业务，以有利于对私营商业进行利用、限制与社会主义改造。
