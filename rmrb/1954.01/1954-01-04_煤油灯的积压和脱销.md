    Stockpiling and Shortages of Kerosene Lamps
    Reader Chen Shu writes: Dunhua County, Jilin Province, is located in the famous Northeast forest region. In the past, local farmers were very poor and used "mingzi" (pine roots) for lighting at night. Now that their lives have improved, they have switched to using kerosene lamps for lighting.

    In the winter of 1952, the Dunhua store of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company purchased a total of 1,000 various kerosene lamps to meet the needs of farmers. However, due to the late arrival of the goods, by the time these lamps were transported to Dunhua, it was almost summer, not the time when farmers used lamps in large quantities. As a result, these lamps were treated as "stockpiled materials" and stored in the warehouse.

    In early October 1953, when farmers were about to need kerosene lamps, the store wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to promote kerosene sales and quickly dispose of these "stockpiled" kerosene lamps. They sent a salesperson to find a private merchant who sold lamps and sold him 400 various kerosene lamps and more than 400 various kerosene lamp parts at a price one-third to one-half lower than the market price. After this news spread, two more private merchants came a few days later and bought 100 kerosene lamps at a low price. Soon, when farmers needed lamps, the remaining kerosene lamps of poor quality in the store were quickly sold out. The farmers had no choice but to buy lamps from private merchants. Because of the "rare opportunity," the private merchants sold the lamps to the farmers at a price one-half higher than the market price. In this way, the private merchants made a profit equal to their capital in one transaction, while the farmers who used the lamps suffered a great loss.

    This incident is a lesson for our state-owned stores: State-owned stores must promptly investigate and understand the needs of the people and prepare goods according to seasonal conditions. Otherwise, they will be like the Dunhua store of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company in handling kerosene lamps, where a large number of goods are stockpiled when the masses do not need them, but once the masses need them, the goods are out of stock.

### 煤油灯的积压和脱销

专栏：读者来信摘要

    煤油灯的积压和脱销
    读者陈述来信：吉林省敦化县在东北著名的林区里。从前，当地农民生活很贫困，晚间都用“明子”（松根）照明。现在，他们生活好转了，都改用煤油灯照明了。
    一九五二年冬，中国煤业建筑器材公司敦化商店为了满足农民需要，采买了各种煤油灯共一千盏。但由于进货太迟，这批灯运到敦化时，已快到夏季，不是农民大量用灯的时候。于是，这批灯就被当成“积压物资”而存放在仓库里。
    一九五三年十月初，快到农民需用煤油灯的时候了，商店却想乘大量推销煤油的机会赶快把这批“积压”着的煤油灯处理掉。他们派推销员找来了一个卖灯的私商，以低于市价三分之一到二分之一的价格卖给他各种煤油灯四百盏，各种煤油灯的零件四百多件。这一消息传出后，过了几天又有两个私商跑来用低价买去了一百盏煤油灯。不久，农民需要用灯，商店剩下的一些质量不好的煤油灯很快卖光了。农民没法可想，只好向私商买灯。私商因“奇货可居”，就以高于市价二分之一的价钱把灯卖给农民。这样，私商在一转手之间就赚了对本对利，而用灯的农民则吃了很大的亏。
    这件事情对我们的国营商店是一个教训：国营商店必须根据季节情况及时调查和了解人民的需要准备货品。否则，就会像中国煤业建筑器材公司敦化商店处理煤油灯那样，在群众不需要时货物大量积压，一旦群众需要而货物却脱销了。
