Malenkov, and Chairman Mao Zedong, flanked by the flags and portraits of leaders of other People's Democratic countries. The bright colors of the flags, the scarlet slogans, and the colorful flowers, coupled with the dazzling electric lights filling the hall, seemed to illuminate even more brilliantly the eternal friendship between the Vietnamese people and the people of the socialist and People's Democratic countries family.

The Central Organizing Committee of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month proposed the election of President Ho Chi Minh, Chairman G.M. Malenkov, and Chairman Mao Zedong as honorary chairmen of the conference. The entire audience stood up, unanimously approved the proposal, and cheered with applause.

Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, President of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association, and Chairman of the Central Organizing Committee of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, delivered the opening speech at the meeting. His opening speech was repeatedly interrupted by prolonged applause.

Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party, delivered an important speech at the meeting. His speech received thunderous and prolonged applause from the entire audience.

Subsequently, representatives of various political parties, mass organizations, combat heroes of the People's Army, and model workers successively took the stage to express their feelings about the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month. They unanimously hailed the sincere friendship between the Vietnamese people and the people of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people, and the people of other People's Democratic countries, expressed their deep gratitude to the people of the fraternal countries for their assistance and support, and pledged to learn from them in all aspects.

Congratulatory telegrams from various people's organizations of the Soviet Union and China were welcomed with lasting applause.

Malenkov, Chairman Mao Zedong, the People's Democratic countries, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and various people's organizations of China.

The representatives attending the conference finally shouted slogans, cheered for the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries, and wished the leaders of the fraternal countries longevity. The conference concluded successfully with the singing of the Internationale.

Before the opening ceremony, on the morning of the 18th, the representatives attending the conference listened to a broadcast from Radio Beijing of the congratulatory telegram from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and various people's organizations to the Vietnamese people on the opening of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month. The representatives were deeply moved to hear from the broadcast the warm sympathy and firm support of the Chinese people for the Vietnamese people's resistance war.

The picture exhibition hall introducing the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries was crowded with visitors. The several thousand pictures on display introduced the achievements of the Soviet people in completing the Five-Year Plan, the grand construction sites of the Soviet Union, the joyful images of the Chinese people in the work of national construction, the heroic struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the happy lives of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries, and the warm reception of the Vietnamese delegations by the fraternal people during their visits to fraternal countries. These pictures illustrated the invincible strength of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the unshakable friendship between the Vietnamese people and the people of the socialist and People's Democratic countries.

In the evening, all the representatives joyfully watched Soviet films, Soviet and Chinese song and dance performances, and Vietnamese dramas and folk song and dance performances.

Truong Chinh's Speech at the Opening Ceremony

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: According to Vietnam News Agency, 20th: Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party, spoke at the opening ceremony of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month. Truong Chinh said that the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month is a good opportunity for the Vietnamese people to once again express their gratitude to the Soviet and Chinese people. The Soviet people defeated the German and Japanese fascists, thereby providing favorable conditions for the Vietnamese people to lead the "August Revolution" to victory. The Chinese people have given us brotherly support and introduced us to valuable revolutionary experiences. At the same time, on such an occasion, we can also express again our gratitude to the people of other People's Democratic countries who inspire us and wholeheartedly support us.

After a detailed analysis of how to enhance the people's patriotism and internationalism, Truong Chinh said that the friendship between our people and the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries is a source of our great strength.

He called on the Vietnamese people to learn from the fraternal countries' experience in struggle. Truong Chinh said that we have in the past, and are still now, applying the revolutionary experiences of the socialist and People's Democratic countries to the specific environment of Vietnam, and further applying these experiences to the current task of mobilizing the peasant masses to implement the land policy of the Party and the government and carrying out land reform to advance the war of resistance.

He continued, "The Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month should become a powerful driving force to inspire our people and strengthen the friendly relations between Vietnam and other fraternal countries. In order to consolidate this eternal friendship with practical actions, I suggest that the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association and the Vietnam-China Friendship Association:

* Educate our people in the spirit of internationalism and patriotism;
* Help our people to understand the fraternal countries more deeply and learn from their rich experience;
* Expand the relations between Vietnam and the fraternal countries, especially between Vietnam and China, in all aspects – politically, economically, and culturally;
* Thoroughly expose the lying propaganda of the imperialists and their lackeys who slander our fraternal countries;
* Contribute all our strength to completing the current two central tasks: advancing the war of resistance and implementing land reform."

Ton Duc Thang's Opening Speech

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: According to Vietnam News Agency, 19th: Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, President of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association, and Chairman of the Central Organizing Committee of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, said in his opening speech at the opening ceremony of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month held in a certain place in North Vietnam on January 18th, that on January 18, 1950, the government of the People's Republic of China was the first to recognize the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and later the government of the Soviet Union and the governments of other People's Democratic countries successively recognized the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressing their friendship towards our people. Since then, every January 18th has been regarded as a historically significant anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries. On January 18th this year, we begin to hold the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month to strengthen the unity and friendship between the Vietnamese people and the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries.

Ton Duc Thang said that under the illumination of the October Socialist Revolution, the Vietnamese revolutionary struggle led by the Vietnamese working class and its general staff – the Indochinese Communist Party founded by President Ho Chi Minh – has achieved brilliant successes; it is also because of the victory of the October Revolution that the Vietnamese working class and the working people have always been full of confidence in the final victory in the past decades of revolutionary struggle, in countless tests and difficulties. In the past long and arduous struggle, the Vietnamese people have always trusted the Soviet Union and learned from the Soviet people. In the twenty-four years since the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party, despite the enemy's terrorist activities, activities commemorating the great October Revolution Festival have been carried out every year in Vietnam, and many commemorative meetings have been held in prisons. Despite the massacres, arrests, and intimidation by the imperialists and feudal forces, the Vietnamese people have always been inclined towards the Soviet Union, and their trust in the Soviet Union has not been destroyed but has been strengthened day by day.

Ton Duc Thang pointed out that since the victory of the "August Revolution", the friendship between the Vietnamese and Soviet people has been developing and consolidating day by day. In the past seven or eight years, the Soviet people have been consistently sympathizing with and supporting our just struggle against foreign aggressors for national independence; and the Vietnamese people are very happy to know about the achievements of the Soviet people in peaceful construction, and wholeheartedly support the Soviet Union. The past, present, and future of the Soviet Union have always been a brilliant example. The Vietnamese people clearly realize that the Soviet Union's today is Vietnam's tomorrow.

Ton Duc Thang then talked about the friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese people, saying that the Vietnamese people and the neighboring fraternal Chinese people also have a long history of friendly relations. The friendship and unity between Vietnam and China are established and developed on the basis of this historical relationship. Since the official establishment of diplomatic relations between Vietnam and China at the beginning of 1950, the friendship between the two countries has become even more consolidated than before. In the past few years, the Vietnamese people have warmly hailed the outstanding achievements of the Chinese people in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, carrying out land reform, and engaging in economic construction. The Vietnamese people regard these achievements as their own achievements. Ton Duc Thang said that the Vietnamese people have learned valuable revolutionary experience from the Chinese revolution and the Chinese people, learned Mao Zedong Thought – the thought that brilliantly applies the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to the reality of China, and learned valuable experience in the three aspects of united front, armed struggle, and party building. President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party have brilliantly applied these experiences that guided the Chinese revolution to victory to the specific situation in Vietnam, leading our people to struggle and achieve major victories, and will certainly achieve complete victory in the future. Our people have learned from China's experience in carrying out land reform and are currently working hard to implement land reform, realizing the slogan "Land to the Tiller," thereby advancing the war of resistance to complete victory.

Ton Duc Thang then said that the Soviet Union is a fortress of world peace. The unity of the Soviet Union and China further strengthens the world peace and democracy camp. Therefore, we are very happy to strengthen our friendship with these two great countries in the world. The friendship of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China is closely related to the friendship between the Vietnamese people and the people of other People's Democratic countries, as well as the friendship between the Vietnamese people and the people of the two fraternal countries of Cambodia and Laos who are fighting alongside us against a common enemy.

When talking about the unlimited prospects for the friendly solidarity between the Vietnamese people and the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries, Ton Duc Thang pointed out that it is because it is built on the internationalist spirit of the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, built on the vital interests of the Vietnamese people and the people of fraternal countries, and built on the foundation of peace and democracy. This friendship is extremely needed by Vietnam, because it is an important factor guaranteeing our victory in the war of resistance and successful construction. In the present and in the future, we must constantly develop and consolidate this friendship.

Ton Duc Thang pointed out that the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month will cause a high tide of our learning from fraternal countries. This will help our people to better understand the situation of fraternal countries, develop and strengthen our lasting solidarity and friendship with fraternal countries, especially the friendship among Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China; this will also help our people learn valuable experience to complete the two central tasks of advancing the war of resistance and implementing land reform, achieve national independence and freedom, and contribute to the cause of defending world peace and the lasting friendship of all countries.

Ton Duc Thang finally said that the Vietnamese people firmly stand in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, constantly consolidating and developing solidarity and friendship with the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries, as well as the people of the two fraternal countries of Cambodia and Laos, actively promoting the war of resistance and implementing land reform. In this way, our people will surely win the final victory.

    以国际主义和爱国主义的精神来教育我国人民；
    帮助我国人民更深刻地认识兄弟国家，并学习它们的丰富的经验；
    从各方面——政治方面、经济方面、文化方面扩大越南与兄弟国家、首先是越南和中国之间的关系；
    彻底揭露帝国主义者和他们的仆从诬蔑我们的兄弟国家的撒谎宣传；
    贡献出我们的全部力量来完成目前的两个中心任务：推进抗战和实行土地改革。
    孙德胜的开幕词
    【新华社二十日讯】据越南通讯社十九日讯：越南国民联合战线全国委员会主席、越苏友好协会会长、越苏中友好月中央组织委员会主席孙德胜，一月十八日在北越某地举行的越苏中友好月开幕典礼上的开幕词说，一九五○年一月十八日，中华人民共和国政府首先承认了越南民主共和国政府，以后苏联政府和其他人民民主国家政府相继承认了越南民主共和国政府，表示了对我国人民的友谊。从那时起，每年的一月十八日都作为越南民主共和国与苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家建立邦交的具有历史意义的纪念日。今年一月十八日，我们开始举行越苏中友好月，以加强越南人民与苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家之间的团结和友谊。
    孙德胜说，在十月社会主义革命的光辉照耀下，越南工人阶级及其参谋总部——胡志明主席创立的印度支那共产党领导的越南革命斗争取得了辉煌成就；也是由于十月革命的胜利，越南工人阶级和劳动人民在过去几十年的革命斗争中，在无数次考验和困难中，对最后胜利始终满怀信心。在过去漫长而艰苦的斗争中，越南人民一直信赖苏联，并向苏联人民学习。在印度支那共产党成立以后的二十四年中，尽管有敌人的恐怖活动，越南境内每年都进行了纪念伟大的十月革命节的活动，许多次纪念会是在监狱中举行的。尽管帝国主义者和封建势力进行屠杀、逮捕和威吓，越南人民一直倾向苏联，他们对苏联的信赖不但没有被摧毁，反而一天天加强了。
    孙德胜指出：自从“八月革命”胜利后，越、苏两国人民之间的友谊一直在日益发展和巩固。在过去七、八年中，苏联人民一直在坚持不渝地同情和声援我们反对外国侵略者、争取民族独立的正义斗争；而越南人民很高兴知道苏联人民和平建设的成就，并全心全意支持苏联。苏联的过去、现在和将来始终是一个辉煌的榜样，越南人民清楚地认识到：苏联的今天，就是越南的明天。
    孙德胜接着谈到越、中两国人民的友谊说，越南人民和毗邻的兄弟般的中国人民，也有悠久的友好关系。越、中两国的友谊和团结就是在这种历史关系的基础上建立和发展起来的。自从一九五零年年初越、中两国正式建立外交关系以来，两国的友谊比以前更加巩固了。在过去几年中，越南人民热烈地欢呼中国人民在抗美援朝、土地改革、经济建设等方面的卓越成就。越南人民把这些成就当作是他们自己的成就。孙德胜说，越南人民从中国革命和中国人民那里学习了宝贵的革命经验，学习了毛泽东思想——天才地将马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的学说应用于中国的实际的思想，学习了统一战线、武装斗争和党的建设这三方面的宝贵的经验。胡志明主席和越南劳动党将这些引导中国革命走向胜利的经验，天才地应用于越南的具体情况，领导我国人民进行斗争并取得了重大胜利，而且今后也一定会取得完全的胜利。我国人民学习了中国实行土地改革的经验，目前正在努力实行土地改革，实现“耕者有其田”的口号，从而把抗战推向完全胜利。
    孙德胜接着说，苏联是世界和平的堡垒。苏联和中国的团结，进一步加强了世界和平民主阵营。因此，我们很高兴加强我们与世界上这两个伟大的国家的友谊。越南、苏联和中国的友谊，是与越南人民和其他人民民主国家人民之间的友谊，以及越南人民和正在与我们并肩作战抵抗共同敌人的高棉和寮国两个兄弟国家人民之间的友谊有密切关联的。
    孙德胜在谈到越南人民和苏联、中国以及其他人民民主国家人民之间的友好团结的无限前途时指出，因为它是建筑在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说的国际主义精神的基础上，建筑在越南人民和兄弟国家人民切身利益的基础上，建筑在和平与民主的基础上的。这种友谊是越南极其需要的，因为它是保证我们抗战胜利和建设成功的一个重要因素。在现在和将来，我们都必须不断地发展并巩固这种友谊。
    孙德胜指出：越苏中友好月将引起我们向兄弟国家学习的高潮。这将帮助我们的人民去更好地了解兄弟国家的情况，发展和加强我们对兄弟国家的持久的团结和友谊，特别是越、苏、中三国的友谊；这也将帮助我国人民学习到宝贵的经验，以完成推进抗战、实行土地改革这两项中心任务，获得民族独立和自由，并对保卫世界和平与各国的持久友谊的事业作出贡献。
    孙德胜最后说：越南人民坚决站在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营中，不断地巩固和发展与苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家人民、以及高棉和寮国两个兄弟国家人民之间的团结和友谊，积极推进抗战和实行土地改革。这样，我国人民必将赢得最后的胜利。
