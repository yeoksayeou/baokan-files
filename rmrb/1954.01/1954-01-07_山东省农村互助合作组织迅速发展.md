The Party's general line and general task during the transition period have illuminated the path forward for our country, and have also illuminated the hearts of every farmer and every rural work cadre. Mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Shandong are developing vigorously. Through comparing the new and old lives, comparing organized production and individual production, and through careful accounting, farmers have not only recognized the cruel exploitation of unscrupulous merchants and the boundless benefits from the state, but also seen through the weakness of the small-peasant economy which is as unstable as "frost on a tile." They resolutely sell surplus grain to the state and take the road of mutual aid and cooperation towards socialist prosperity for all. The farmers said, "We have overthrown the three tigers (imperialism, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalism), but there are still two wolves lying at the door (the exploitation of unscrupulous merchants and the road of the rich getting richer while the majority suffer)." The cadres feel enlightened and have confidence in leading mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and the enthusiasm of farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations has also increased. A rural Party member in Junan County, after attending the Party representative meeting in the county, it was already 11:00 p.m., but he still rushed back to rectify his own mutual aid team. After the farmers of Shahe Village in Licheng County sold 200,000 jin of grain to the state, the shares of the village supply and marketing cooperative doubled compared to before. Out of the 865 households in the whole village, 318 households applied to join agricultural production cooperatives, of which 39 households joined the Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative, and other farmers established eight more cooperatives themselves. Guangrao County originally planned to establish 174 agricultural production cooperatives from last winter to this spring, and the confidence was not great. At the county, district, and township three-level meetings, various specific conditions were analyzed, and the conclusion was that 202 could be established. The Jiaozhou Special District originally planned to establish 500 cooperatives (from last winter to this spring), but after research at the county, district, and township three-level meetings, 800 could be established.

The rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Shandong, and the number of agricultural production cooperatives developed, quickly broke through the original provincial plan of establishing 4,800 agricultural production cooperatives from last winter to this spring. And the original planned number was equal to four times the number of existing agricultural production cooperatives in Shandong. A new situation has emerged in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Shandong.

In order to adapt to this new situation and meet the requirements of farmers to organize production, the Shandong Provincial Committees of the Chinese Communist Party at all levels are re-considering the various conditions for establishing agricultural production cooperatives in their respective regions, formulating practical and feasible development plans, and actively conducting investigations and research, and training cadres to prepare for the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations this year.

    山东省农村互助合作组织迅速发展
    党在过渡时期的总路线、总任务，照亮了我们国家前进的道路，也照亮了每个农民和每个农村工作干部的心，山东互助合作组织蓬勃地发展起来了。农民通过新旧生活的对比；组织起来生产和单干生产的对比；通过算细账，不仅认识了奸商对他们的残酷剥削，国家对他们的无限好处，而且看透了小农经济站不住脚根的弱点，把小农经济比作“瓦上霜”；坚决把余粮卖给国家，走互助合作通向社会主义大家富裕的路。农民们说：“我们打倒了三只虎（帝国主义、封建地主、官僚资本主义），门口还卧着两只狼（奸商的剥削和少数人发财多数人受苦的富农道路）”。干部感到心亮了，领导互助合作组织有了信心，农民参加互助合作组织的积极性也提高了。莒南县一个农村党员，在县里开完党代表会议已是深夜十一点了，还赶回去整顿自己的互助组。历城县沙河村农民把二十万斤粮食卖给国家后，村供销社股金比原来增长了一倍。全村农民八百六十五户，就有三百十八户申请加入农业生产合作社，其中有三十九户参加了王朝佑农业生产合作社，别的农户又自办了八个社。广饶县原计划去冬今春办一百七十四个农业生产合作社，信心还不大，在县、区、乡三级会议上分析了各种具体条件，结论是能办二百零二个。胶州专区原计划能办五百个社（去冬今春），经过县、区、乡三级会议研究能办八百个。
    山东互助合作运动的迅速开展，农业生产合作社发展的数字，很快突破了原来全省计划在去冬今春办四千八百个农业生产合作社的数字了。而原来计划的数字，就等于山东原有农业生产合作社的四倍。山东互助合作运动出现了新的局面。
    山东各级中共党委为适应这种新的情况，满足农民组织起来生产的要求，正在重新考虑本地区办农业生产合作社的各种条件，制订切实可行的发展计划；并积极调查研究、训练干部为今年发展互助合作组织作好准备。（本报记者张荣安）
