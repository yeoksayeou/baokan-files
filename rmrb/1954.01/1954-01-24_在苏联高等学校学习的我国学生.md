Our Students Studying in Soviet Higher Education Institutions

    New Study Life
    Student of Kalinin Polytechnic Institute, Xu Shiheng
    I am a graduate student in the High Voltage Department of the Leningrad Kalinin Polytechnic Institute. Here, the study time for general graduate students is three years. In the first year and a half, they need to complete a basic course (such as electrical engineering principles), a professional course (such as high voltage engineering principles), and philosophy. The latter year and a half is for writing the thesis. During the study period, the main methods are self-study and research. If there are any problems, you can discuss them with the advising professor.
    Before I left the motherland, I had only studied one high-voltage engineering course (elective). Many other relevant basic courses had not been touched. Therefore, I encountered difficulties in my studies. As soon as we arrived at the school, we told the advising professor about this situation. After some consideration and research, he believed that we should also make up the major courses of the Soviet university's fourth and fifth years. The department arranged the courses according to this situation. The teachers took special care of us during the classes, often asking us if we understood and introducing us to reference books. In terms of philosophy, Soviet teachers also opened a special class for us Chinese graduate students (to study under the guidance of teachers). We first studied Engels' "Anti-Dühring." This was difficult for us, but because the learning conditions were good, and it was carried out in a planned way, and with the leadership of the teachers, we gained a lot.
    There are many laboratories in the school. In the past, when we conducted high-voltage experiments in China, we could only watch the professors' "performances" and could not do it ourselves. But here, not only can we watch the teachers do it, but we can also participate in the experiments ourselves.
    Last summer, we went to the factory for an internship and saw the latest high-voltage equipment that we had never seen before. This opened our eyes. The factory leaders also enthusiastically helped us and sent dedicated personnel to guide us. If there were any problems, we could ask the workers and ask them to explain. If the workers' explanations were not complete enough, we could also ask the workshop technical director. The factory also organized discussion meetings for us, and invited design experts to explain some specialized issues to us. Therefore, although the internship time was not long, our gains were great.
    The students studying in the Soviet Union spend all day studying and do not like sports. When Soviet students saw this situation, they often advised us to go out and play more. An old lady who taught us Russian often asked us to go out for walks more. Tight homework is naturally a reason, but most of it is because we are not good at managing our time, so we feel overwhelmed. Our exam results are very good, mostly five points. The students in the motherland must be very happy to know this news.
    Just as we were studying hard, a very unfortunate thing happened in the school, that is, our advising professor A. A. Gorev died of overwork. In the first class after his death, the teacher who taught regional power transmission said to us: "Put your notebooks away! I am not going to talk about the book today. I want to talk about Professor Gorev." Our Professor Gorev was born in 1884 and was a graduate of our school. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the age of nineteen. After the establishment of the Soviet regime, he engaged in planning work under the instructions of Comrade Lenin. He dedicated his life to the teaching and research of high-voltage engineering. Under his guidance, many new laboratories were created. He studied many issues related to mathematics and high-voltage engineering, and created many new practical formulas and theories. From 1937 to 1946, he invented an experimental circuit for testing high-voltage equipment - the "Gorev circuit," and won the Stalin Prize. Until his death, he was still diligently studying the problem of 400 kV current transformers. The death of Professor Gorev made us very sad.

    Unforgettable Friendship
    Student of the Kuibyshev Institute of Civil Engineering, Bi Kebao
    I came to Moscow the year before last and was assigned to study at the Moscow Kuibyshev Institute of Civil Engineering. My Soviet roommate called me "Katyusha," what an interesting name!
    When I started studying, I was not used to doing math problems on the blackboard like elementary school students. But the facts told me that this learning method is correct. Mathematical exercises are not for calculating a number, but mainly for training students' thinking methods. Teachers in the classroom require students to pay attention to every step of the calculation when doing exercises, but it should be concise. Sometimes I even used two sheets of paper to solve a problem, while the teacher only used one formula.
    The Chinese students have very good academic performance. In last year's summer exam, many students' grades were all excellent (five points). Of course, we cannot be satisfied with the current results. In the future, we must continue to better learn the advanced Soviet science and technology. Here, Soviet teachers are particularly concerned about our Chinese students. For example, when we first started learning, we encountered many difficulties. We didn't understand the language, we couldn't understand the drawings, and we didn't know what to do. Soviet teachers patiently helped us. Once, our department head asked us to talk to understand what difficulties we had in our studies. When he knew that my drawings had not been submitted, he said to me: "You should read more books. After a few years, you will return to the motherland to participate in national construction..." Another time, a teacher said to me: "The difficulties in front of you can be overcome. Soon, you will learn very well." These words encouraged me and gave me endless courage, and I firmly believed that there were no insurmountable difficulties. In the study, Soviet comrades also gave us specific help. For example, when I encountered difficulties in learning chemistry and projective geometry, the teacher helped me alone and gave me tutoring. With their care and help, I successfully completed this stage of study. There was a Soviet female student, not very tall, with light yellow hair, smart and naughty. Whenever the class was over, she always took the initiative to find me and help me correct my notes.
    Our surveying practice was conducted in the suburbs of Moscow. When it rained in summer, the students took off their clothes and covered the instruments and drawing boards, and happily jumped and ran in the rain; after the rain, we continued to carry out the measurement. Speaking of measurement, I think of Moscow's urban architecture, streets, and houses, they are so beautiful, lovely, and great. Although Moscow is an ancient city with a history of more than 800 years, it is so young.
    Here, every time we receive the People's Daily, we always rush to read it. When students meet, they talk about the construction of the motherland; when visiting factories and collective farms, we think of the beautiful prospects of the motherland.

  A Few Hopes for Our Schools
      Student of the Physics Department of Leningrad University, Qing Chengrui
    Last summer was the most intense period of our study. I participated in an exam (four courses) and a test. Before the exam and test, we reviewed and summarized what we had learned in the semester, and gained a lot. I got five points in each course.
    In more than a year of studying in the Soviet Union, I have made great progress in all aspects, but this progress is obviously not enough compared with the requirements of the motherland for us. Chinese students all have the spirit of overcoming difficulties, but they all feel that the burden is relatively heavy. This is mainly because our foundation is poor and the foundation is not well laid.
    Our third-year courses are very numerous, including atomic physics, thermodynamics, mathematics, electrodynamics, as well as political economy and Russian, etc., in addition to physics special experiments and other courses. At present, we generally feel that time is not enough, which requires us to rationally allocate study time and improve study methods.
    Now let's talk about the simple situation of the school. Leningrad University is one of the universities with the most students in the Soviet Union. In order to accommodate more students, the school tries its best to "make the best use of everything" and give full play to the potential of each classroom. From 9:00 am to 9:00 pm every day, every classroom and laboratory rarely has free time. To give an example, the Department of Physics has many grades, and each grade has several classes, but the entire department has only one large classroom. Therefore, appropriate arrangements have been made in terms of time: in the morning, freshmen and sophomores listen to lectures in the large classroom, and in the afternoon, juniors take classes inside. To be more specific, freshmen are from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm, sophomores are from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm, and juniors are after 3:00 pm or 5:00 pm (because not every class listens to lectures every day). In this way, classrooms and equipment are fully utilized. I think this method is worth learning from our schools. Thinking back to studying at domestic universities, after 5 o'clock every day, the classrooms were all empty and the instruments were "sleeping", which is a pity. I hope this situation can be changed in the future.

    在苏联高等学校学习的我国学生
    新的学习生活
    加里宁工学院学生　徐士珩
    我是列宁格勒加里宁工学院电机系高压讲座的研究生。这里，一般研究生的学习时间都是三年，前一年半内要学完一门基础课（如电工原理）、一门专业课（如高电压工程原理）和哲学，后一年半是写作论文。在学习期间，主要采取自学和研究的方式，有问题时可以找指导教授商量。
    在我离开祖国以前，只念过一门高压工程（选课），其他有关的许多基本课程就没接触过，因此在学习中遇到了困难。一到学校，我们就把这种情况告诉了指导教授。他经过一番考虑研究以后，认为我们还应该补习苏联大学四、五年级的大部课程。系里根据这种情况，设法把课程安排好；上课时教师特别关心我们，常常问我们懂不懂，为我们介绍参考书。哲学方面，苏联教师还专为我们中国研究生开设了一个班（在教师指导下进行学习）。我们先学恩格斯的“反杜林论”。这对我们来说是吃力的，但因为学习的条件好，而且是有计划地进行的，又有教师的领导，收获很大。
    学校里有很多的实验室。我们过去在国内进行高压实验时，只能看看教授们的“表演”，自己不能亲自动手；而在这里，不仅可以看教师做，自己还可以参加实验。
    去年夏天，我们到工厂里去实习了一次，见到了以前没有见过的最新式的高压设备。这使我们开了一次眼界。工厂领导方面也热心地帮助我们，派专人指导。有了问题，可以问工人，请他们解释；如果工人解释得不够完全，还可以问车间技术主任。工厂方面还为我们组织了讨论会，请设计专家给我们讲解一些专门问题。因此，虽然实习时间不长，但我们的收获却是很大的。
    在苏联留学的同学，整天念书，不喜欢运动。苏联同学看到这种情况后，常常劝我们多出去玩；教我们俄文的一位老太太，常让我们多出去散步。功课紧，自然是原因，但多半是由于我们不善于支配时间，以致感到忙不过来。我们考试成绩都很好，大多是五分。祖国的同学们知道了这个消息，一定很高兴。
    正当我们紧张地学习着的时候，学校里发生了一件很不幸的事情，就是我们的指导教授亚·亚·高列夫积劳病逝了。在他逝世后的第一堂课上，教区域送电的教师对我们说：“把本子收起来吧！我今天不准备讲书，我想讲讲关于高列夫教授的事。”我们的高列夫教授生于一八八四年，是我们学校的毕业生。他十九岁时即加入苏联共产党。在苏维埃政权成立以后，他在列宁同志的指示下从事计划工作。他以自己的一生献给了高电压工程的教学和研究工作。在他的指导下，创建了许多新的实验室。他研究了很多有关数学和高电压工程方面的问题，创造了不少新的实用的公式和理论。在一九三七年到一九四六年期间，他发明了一种用以试验高压设备的实验线路——“高列夫线路”，获得了斯大林奖金。直到他死前，还在勤勉地研究着四百千伏的电流变压器的问题。高列夫教授的死，使我们感到很悲痛。
    难忘的友情
    古比雪夫建筑工程学院学生　毕可宝
    我是在前年到莫斯科的，被分配到莫斯科古比雪夫建筑工程学院学习。同屋的苏联同学叫我“喀秋沙”，这个名字多么有意思呀！
    开始学习时，我不习惯像小学生一样到黑板上作数学习题。但事实告诉我，这种学习方法是正确的。数学练习不是为了算一个数字，主要在于训练学生的思想方法。教师在讲堂上要求学生在做习题时注意演算的每一个步骤，但要简明。有时我竟用了两张纸来解一个题，而教师只用了一个公式。
    中国同学的学习成绩都很好，去年暑期考试，许多同学的成绩全部是优秀（五分）。当然，我们是不能满足于现有的成绩的。今后要继续更好地学习苏联先进的科学技术。这里，苏联教师对我们中国同学特别关心。例如，开始学习时，我们碰到很多困难，语言不懂，图又看不懂，不知怎样做才好，苏联教师便耐心帮助我们。有一次，我们的系主任找我们去谈话，了解我们在学习上有什么困难。当他知道我的图还没交上时，就对我说：“你应该更多地读书，几年之后你就要回到祖国去，参加国家建设……”另一次，一个教师对我说：“在你们面前的困难都是可以克服的，不久，你就会学得很好。”这些话鼓舞了我，使我有了无穷的勇气，深信没有不可克服的困难。学习中，苏联同志还给予我们具体的帮助，例如，我在学习化学和投影几何遇到困难时，教师就单独帮助我，给我补课。在他们的关怀、帮助下，我顺利地完成了这一阶段的学习。有一个苏联女同学，个子不大，浅黄色头发，聪明而淘气，每当讲完课时，她总是主动地找我，帮助我改笔记。
    我们的测量实习，是在莫斯科近郊进行的。夏季下雨的时候，同学们就把自己的衣服脱下来，盖在仪器上、画板上，高兴地在雨地里跳、跑；雨过了，我们再继续进行测量。谈到测量，我就想到莫斯科的城市建筑、街道、房屋，它们都是那样的美丽、可爱和伟大。莫斯科虽是有着八百多年历史的古城，但它却是那样年青。
    在这里，每次接到人民日报时，我们总是争先恐后地抢着看。同学们见了面，就谈祖国的建设；参观工厂、集体农庄时，我们便想到祖国的美丽远景。
  对我国学校的一点希望
      列宁格勒大学物理系学生　庆诚瑞
    去年夏季，是我们学习最紧张的时期，我参加了一次考试（四门课程）和一次测验。在考试、测验以前，我们进行了复习，把学期中所学的东西总结了一下，收获很大，我每门课程都考了五分。
    在苏联学习一年多来，我在各方面都有很大的进步，但这种进步和祖国对我们的要求比起来，显然是很不够的。中国同学都有克服困难的精神，可是都感到负担比较重，这主要是因为我们的底子差，基础打得不够好。
    我们三年级的课程是非常多的，有原子物理、热力学、数学、电动力学、以及政治经济学和俄文等等，此外还有物理专题实验等课程。目前我们普遍感到时间不够用，这就要求我们合理地支配学习时间，改进学习方法。
    现在来谈谈学校的简单情况吧。列宁格勒大学是苏联学生最多的大学之一，学校方面为了容纳更多的同学，尽可能地做到“物尽其用”，使每一间教室充分发挥潜力。每天从上午九时到晚上九时，每间教室、实验室，很少有空的时间。举一个例子来说，物理系有许多年级，每个年级又有好几个班，而全系只有一个大教室。因此在时间上作了适当的安排：上午是一年级和二年级同学在大教室里听讲演，下午是三年级同学在里面上课。再说得具体些，一年级在上午九时到下午一时，二年级在下午一时到三时，而三年级则在三时或五时以后（因为每个班不是每天都听讲演的）。这样就充分利用了教室和设备。我认为，这种办法是值得我国学校学习的。回想在国内大学学习时，每天五点钟以后，教室里全是空的，仪器都在“睡觉”，真是可惜。我希望今后能改变这种情况。
