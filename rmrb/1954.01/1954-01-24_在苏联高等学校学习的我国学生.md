Our Students Studying in Soviet Higher Education Institutions

    New Study Life
    Student of Kalinin Polytechnic Institute, Xu Shiheng
    I am a graduate student in the High Voltage Department of the Leningrad Kalinin Polytechnic Institute. Here, the study time for general graduate students is three years. In the first year and a half, they need to complete a basic course (such as electrical engineering principles), a professional course (such as high voltage engineering principles), and philosophy. The latter year and a half is for writing the thesis. During the study period, the main methods are self-study and research. If there are any problems, you can discuss them with the advising professor.
    Before I left the motherland, I had only studied one high-voltage engineering course (elective). Many other relevant basic courses had not been touched. Therefore, I encountered difficulties in my studies. As soon as we arrived at the school, we told the advising professor about this situation. After some consideration and research, he believed that we should also make up the major courses of the Soviet university's fourth and fifth years. The department arranged the courses according to this situation. The teachers took special care of us during the classes, often asking us if we understood and introducing us to reference books. In terms of philosophy, Soviet teachers also opened a special class for us Chinese graduate students (to study under the guidance of teachers). We first studied Engels' "Anti-DÃ¼hring." This was difficult for us, but because the learning conditions were good, and it was carried out in a planned way, and with the leadership of the teachers, we gained a lot.
    There are many laboratories in the school. In the past, when we conducted high-voltage experiments in China, we could only watch the professors' "performances" and could not do it ourselves. But here, not only can we watch the teachers do it, but we can also participate in the experiments ourselves.
    Last summer, we went to the factory for an internship and saw the latest high-voltage equipment that we had never seen before. This opened our eyes. The factory leaders also enthusiastically helped us and sent dedicated personnel to guide us. If there were any problems, we could ask the workers and ask them to explain. If the workers' explanations were not complete enough, we could also ask the workshop technical director. The factory also organized discussion meetings for us, and invited design experts to explain some specialized issues to us. Therefore, although the internship time was not long, our gains were great.
    The students studying in the Soviet Union spend all day studying and do not like sports. When Soviet students saw this situation, they often advised us to go out and play more. An old lady who taught us Russian often asked us to go out for walks more. Tight homework is naturally a reason, but most of it is because we are not good at managing our time, so we feel overwhelmed. Our exam results are very good, mostly five points. The students in the motherland must be very happy to know this news.
    Just as we were studying hard, a very unfortunate thing happened in the school, that is, our advising professor A. A. Gorev died of overwork. In the first class after his death, the teacher who taught regional power transmission said to us: "Put your notebooks away! I am not going to talk about the book today. I want to talk about Professor Gorev." Our Professor Gorev was born in 1884 and was a graduate of our school. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the age of nineteen. After the establishment of the Soviet regime, he engaged in planning work under the instructions of Comrade Lenin. He dedicated his life to the teaching and research of high-voltage engineering. Under his guidance, many new laboratories were created. He studied many issues related to mathematics and high-voltage engineering, and created many new practical formulas and theories. From 1937 to 1946, he invented an experimental circuit for testing high-voltage equipment - the "Gorev circuit," and won the Stalin Prize. Until his death, he was still diligently studying the problem of 400 kV current transformers. The death of Professor Gorev made us very sad.

    Unforgettable Friendship
    Student of the Kuibyshev Institute of Civil Engineering, Bi Kebao
    I came to Moscow the year before last and was assigned to study at the Moscow Kuibyshev Institute of Civil Engineering. My Soviet roommate called me "Katyusha," what an interesting name!
    When I started studying, I was not used to doing math problems on the blackboard like elementary school students. But the facts told me that this learning method is correct. Mathematical exercises are not for calculating a number, but mainly for training students' thinking methods. Teachers in the classroom require students to pay attention to every step of the calculation when doing exercises, but it should be concise. Sometimes I even used two sheets of paper to solve a problem, while the teacher only used one formula.
    The Chinese students have very good academic performance. In last year's summer exam, many students' grades were all excellent (five points). Of course, we cannot be satisfied with the current results. In the future, we must continue to better learn the advanced Soviet science and technology. Here, Soviet teachers are particularly concerned about our Chinese students. For example, when we first started learning, we encountered many difficulties. We didn't understand the language, we couldn't understand the drawings, and we didn't know what to do. Soviet teachers patiently helped us. Once, our department head asked us to talk to understand what difficulties we had in our studies. When he knew that my drawings had not been submitted, he said to me: "You should read more books. After a few years, you will return to the motherland to participate in national construction..." Another time, a teacher said to me: "The difficulties in front of you can be overcome. Soon, you will learn very well." These words encouraged me and gave me endless courage, and I firmly believed that there were no insurmountable difficulties. In the study, Soviet comrades also gave us specific help. For example, when I encountered difficulties in learning chemistry and projective geometry, the teacher helped me alone and gave me tutoring. With their care and help, I successfully completed this stage of study. There was a Soviet female student, not very tall, with light yellow hair, smart and naughty. Whenever the class was over, she always took the initiative to find me and help me correct my notes.
    Our surveying practice was conducted in the suburbs of Moscow. When it rained in summer, the students took off their clothes and covered the instruments and drawing boards, and happily jumped and ran in the rain; after the rain, we continued to carry out the measurement. Speaking of measurement, I think of Moscow's urban architecture, streets, and houses, they are so beautiful, lovely, and great. Although Moscow is an ancient city with a history of more than 800 years, it is so young.
    Here, every time we receive the People's Daily, we always rush to read it. When students meet, they talk about the construction of the motherland; when visiting factories and collective farms, we think of the beautiful prospects of the motherland.

  A Few Hopes for Our Schools
      Student of the Physics Department of Leningrad University, Qing Chengrui
    Last summer was the most intense period of our study. I participated in an exam (four courses) and a test. Before the exam and test, we reviewed and summarized what we had learned in the semester, and gained a lot. I got five points in each course.
    In more than a year of studying in the Soviet Union, I have made great progress in all aspects, but this progress is obviously not enough compared with the requirements of the motherland for us. Chinese students all have the spirit of overcoming difficulties, but they all feel that the burden is relatively heavy. This is mainly because our foundation is poor and the foundation is not well laid.
    Our third-year courses are very numerous, including atomic physics, thermodynamics, mathematics, electrodynamics, as well as political economy and Russian, etc., in addition to physics special experiments and other courses. At present, we generally feel that time is not enough, which requires us to rationally allocate study time and improve study methods.
    Now let's talk about the simple situation of the school. Leningrad University is one of the universities with the most students in the Soviet Union. In order to accommodate more students, the school tries its best to "make the best use of everything" and give full play to the potential of each classroom. From 9:00 am to 9:00 pm every day, every classroom and laboratory rarely has free time. To give an example, the Department of Physics has many grades, and each grade has several classes, but the entire department has only one large classroom. Therefore, appropriate arrangements have been made in terms of time: in the morning, freshmen and sophomores listen to lectures in the large classroom, and in the afternoon, juniors take classes inside. To be more specific, freshmen are from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm, sophomores are from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm, and juniors are after 3:00 pm or 5:00 pm (because not every class listens to lectures every day). In this way, classrooms and equipment are fully utilized. I think this method is worth learning from our schools. Thinking back to studying at domestic universities, after 5 o'clock every day, the classrooms were all empty and the instruments were "sleeping", which is a pity. I hope this situation can be changed in the future.
