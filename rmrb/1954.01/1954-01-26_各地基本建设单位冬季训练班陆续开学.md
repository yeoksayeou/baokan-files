Winter training classes for basic construction units in various regions have opened successively.

Winter training classes in construction units in cities of the Northeast region, such as Shenyang, Anshan, Harbin, and Fushun, and provinces such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Songjiang; in the North China region, such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Province; in the Northwest region, such as Xi'an and Gansu Province; and in the East China region, such as Weifang City, Shandong Province, have opened successively. All cadres and workers participating in the training are actively studying the general line of the state during the transition period.

The targets of the winter training are mainly grassroots management personnel, engineering and technical personnel, and workers, with a focus on grassroots cadres. In Anshan City, more than 10,000 workers, and more than 1,000 team leaders and section chiefs from various basic construction units are currently participating in winter training. In addition, more than 4,000 grassroots management cadres, political work cadres, and engineering and technical personnel are participating in winter training either part-time or in their spare time. In Shenyang City, approximately over 20,000 cadres and over 30,000 workers are participating in winter training, with a primary focus on training cadres. The First Engineering Company of Songjiang Province has drawn 121 site directors from its various construction sites to form a site director training class. In Beijing, more than 46,000 workers from over 40 construction units have participated in winter training. Sixteen units affiliated with the Hebei Provincial People's Government's Construction Engineering Bureau, with the exception of a few units, have generally begun intensive training for backbone elements above the level of group leaders, activists, model workers, and special technicians, with more than 3,700 people participating in the training.

All cadres and workers participating in the winter training are currently intensively studying the general line of the state during the transition period. Relevant leading authorities in various regions attach great importance to this work. The Changchun City Winter Training Committee has specially established a central classroom, inviting responsible comrades from the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal People's Government, and other units to give lectures to the teachers and instructors of the various winter training classes. The teachers of the winter training classes use the content of the central classroom as an outline, and then enrich the content in combination with the specific conditions of their own units, so that the teachers can lecture clearly and centrally, and the students can easily understand. The Harbin City Winter Training Committee Office has printed 10,000 sets of political teaching materials and 500 sets of hanging pictures with the content of Soviet industrial and agricultural production and the happy life of the people. The students in various regions are very enthusiastic about learning, and many teachers and students have signed contracts for mutual teaching and learning. In the winter training, many basic construction units will combine the study of the general line with summarizing and exchanging experiences in last year's construction management, technical management, security and welfare, and political work, and systematically study Soviet advanced experiences. Units that have already determined this year's engineering tasks will also study drawings, discuss plans, and try out the preparation of construction organization designs, so that management work can proceed normally as soon as construction starts this year. In addition to political and technical studies, many ordinary workers will also receive special technical training to take on the heavy and complex tasks of factory building construction and equipment installation this year.

    各地基本建设单位冬季训练班陆续开学
    东北区沈阳、鞍山、哈尔滨、抚顺等市及黑龙江、吉林、松江等省；华北区北京市、天津市、河北省；西北区西安市、甘肃省；华东区山东省潍坊市等建筑单位的冬季训练班，已陆续开学。参加学习的全体干部、工人，正积极学习国家过渡时期的总路线。
    冬训对象主要是基层管理人员、工程技术人员和工人，而以基层干部为重点。鞍山市目前各基本建设单位参加冬训的工人已有一万多人，班组长、科队长一千多人。此外还有四千多个基层管理干部、政治工作干部和工程技术人员，半脱离生产或利用业余时间，参加了冬季训练。沈阳市参加冬季训练的干部约有两万多人，工人约有三万多人，首先着重进行的是干部的训练。松江省第一工程公司从所属各工地抽调了一百二十一名工地主任，组成了工地主任训练班。北京市四十多个建筑单位的四万六千多工人已参加了冬训学习。河北省人民政府建筑工程局所属十六个单位，除个别单位外，已普遍开始集训小组长以上的骨干和积极分子、劳动模范、特种技工等，参加学习的有三千七百多人。
    参加冬季训练的全体干部和工人，目前正在紧张地学习国家过渡时期的总路线。各地有关领导机关对这一工作都很重视。长春市冬训委员会，特设立了中心课堂，聘请市委、市人民政府及其他单位的负责同志给各冬训班的教员和辅导员讲课。冬训班的教员以中心课堂所讲的内容作提纲，再结合本单位的具体情况充实内容，这样教员讲起来明确集中，学员听了也容易懂。哈尔滨市冬训委员会办公室已印了一万套政治教材，还印发了以苏联工农业生产和人民幸福生活为内容的五百套挂图。各地学员学习情绪很高，不少教员和学员订了互教互学的合同。许多基本建设单位在冬训中，将结合总路线的学习，总结和交流去年施工管理、技术管理、保安福利、政治工作等经验，并系统地学习苏联先进经验。今年工程任务已经确定的单位，还要学习图纸、讨论计划、试行编制施工组织设计等，以便今年一开工，管理工作就能正常进行。一般工人除进行政治和技术学习外，不少人还将受到特殊技术的训练，以便担负起今年繁重复杂的厂房建设和设备安装任务。
