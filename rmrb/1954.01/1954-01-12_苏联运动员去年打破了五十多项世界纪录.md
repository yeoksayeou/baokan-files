Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: According to TASS, Soviet athletes and sports activities achieved great results in 1953.

	In 1953, Soviet athletes improved more than 300 national records and broke more than 50 official world records. Among them, weightlifters broke 18 world records, twice the number of world records set by Soviet weightlifters in 1952. More than half of the official world weightlifting records were created by Soviet weightlifters. In 1953, Soviet athletes won first place in the world championships for weightlifting, speed skating, and Greco-Roman wrestling. Soviet basketball players won the European championship, and Soviet rowers won many gold medals in the European championships. In 1953, many young Soviet athletes gloriously set new world records in world championships. Among them were 19-year-old Kh. Shegolyeva (world speed skating champion), G. Katozia (world wrestling champion), lightweight weightlifter D. Ivanov (who broke the world weightlifting record four times), and 20-year-old cyclist R. Vagashkin (who created the world's best result). At the same time, Soviet sports activities have also been further developed. In the past year, the Soviet Union has built many new stadiums and opened many new sports schools. Sports activities have a wide mass character; for example, about 200,000 farmers participated in the national weightlifting competition in 1953.

	In 1953, more Soviet sports organizations participated in various international sports activities. At the end of 1946, Soviet athletes participated in only two international sports federations; by 1953, they participated in 23 international sports federations and sports associations. In the past year, Soviet athletes participated in more than 50 international competitions, including nine European and world championships. In addition, they also participated in many international friendship matches. The Soviet Union hosted sports delegations from more than 20 countries in 1953.

	Soviet sports activities will be further developed in 1954. In the new year, intense national and international competitions will greatly increase. At times, the Soviet Union may have ten grand sports competitions held simultaneously on the same day. The Soviet football championship is scheduled to begin in April. Major sports competitions will also be held in the Transcaucasian republics, the Baltic republics, the Belorussian Republic, the Central Asian republics, and the Kazakh Republic. "Correspondence competitions" will be vigorously promoted this year, and athletes from cities thousands of kilometers apart can compete in this form. This year, millions of Soviet athletes will participate in such competitions.

    苏联运动员去年打破了五十多项世界纪录
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联运动员和体育活动在一九五三年获得很大成绩。
    苏联运动员在一九五三年改进了三百多项全国纪录，打破了五十多项正式的世界纪录。其中举重家就打破了十八项世界纪录，为一九五二年苏联举重家所创的世界纪录的两倍。在正式的世界举重纪录中，就有一半以上是由苏联举重家创造的。在一九五三年内，苏联运动员在举重、溜冰和古典式角力三项世界冠军赛中都获得了第一名。苏联篮球运动员获得了欧洲冠军，苏联划船运动员在欧洲冠军赛中获得了许多金质奖章。一九五三年许多年轻的苏联运动员在世界冠军赛中光荣地创造了世界新纪录。其中有十九岁的哈·谢戈利耶娃（世界速度溜冰赛冠军），吉·卡托齐亚（世界角力冠军），轻量级举重家德·伊凡诺夫（他四次打破世界举重纪录），二十岁的自行车运动员罗·瓦加什金（他创造了世界最优秀的成绩）。和这同时，苏联体育活动也有了进一步的发展。在过去一年中，苏联建筑了许多新的运动场，开设了许多新的体育学校。体育活动具有广泛的群众性，例如一九五三年全国举重比赛就有二十万左右的农民参加。
    一九五三年苏联有更多的体育团体参加了各种国际性的体育活动。在一九四六年年底，苏联运动员只参加两个国际体育联合会，到一九五三年他们参加了二十三个国际体育联合会和体育协会。在过去一年中，苏联运动员参加了五十多次国际比赛，其中有九次是欧洲和世界冠军赛。此外，他们还参加了许多次国际友谊赛。苏联在一九五三年招待了二十多个国家的体育代表团。
    苏联体育活动在一九五四年将进一步发展起来。在新的一年中，紧张的全国规模和国际性的比赛将大大增加。有时苏联一天可能有十个盛大的运动比赛同时举行。苏联足球冠军赛定于四月开始举行。外高加索各共和国、波罗的海沿岸各共和国、白俄罗斯共和国、中亚细亚各共和国和哈萨克共和国也将举行盛大的运动比赛。“通讯比赛”今年将大力推广，相隔几千公里的城市的运动员都可以通过这种形式进行比赛。今年参加这种比赛的将有成百万的苏联运动员。
