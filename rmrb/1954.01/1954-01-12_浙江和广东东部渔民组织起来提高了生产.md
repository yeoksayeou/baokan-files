Fishermen along the coast of Zhejiang Province and the eastern Guangdong region have gradually organized themselves for production. In Zhejiang's coastal areas, over 1,700 mutual aid teams and three cooperatives have been organized, involving more than 5,100 fishing boats and over 22,000 fishermen, accounting for 35.5 percent of the fishermen who went to sea during the spring fishing season of 1953. In the eastern Guangdong region, more than 2,000 fishing boats, large and small, have been organized, accounting for about 15 percent of the total. This includes 25 *caos* (each *cao* consists of 20-30 boats and about 200 people engaging in collective production), and 287 fishermen's mutual aid teams. After organizing, productivity greatly increased due to the availability of complete production tools. In the eastern Guangdong region, many fishermen's mutual aid teams saw their fish catches in September and October of last year exceed their total fish catches for the entire year of 1952. In Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, the Red Head boat of the Xiang Yipin Fishery Production Cooperative achieved an average unit output of over 10,200 *jin* during the spring fishing season, while the average output of local fishermen's mutual aid teams was only over 9,300 *jin*, and individual fishermen only managed over 7,500 *jin*. In the past, fishermen were accustomed to not going out to sea on foggy days; after organizing, they created the "umbrella-shaped spreading method" and the "call and response communication method," enabling them to fish at sea even in dense fog. In Nanao County, eastern Guangdong, the mutual aid and cooperative *caos* improved their tools, sought out fishing patterns, discovered many new fishing grounds, and increased their fish catches. Women in fishing areas represent a significant potential for production, but in the past, they rarely participated in production. Last spring, during the large yellow croaker production season, the CPC Zhoushan Prefectural Committee of Zhejiang Province mobilized a large number of women to participate in processing work, initially achieving a division of labor where men fished and women processed, effectively supporting fishery production and increasing the income of fishermen.
    To expand production, fishermen are universally adding production tools. Supported mainly by their own accumulated funds and with state loans, fishermen in the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province built over 2,000 new boats of various types in 1953 to participate in winter fishing. Fishermen in Guang'ao Township, eastern Guangdong, added more than 30 fishing boats in 1953, and many mutual aid teams also added two or three sets of different fishing tools. They are now developing towards diversified and rotational production, striving to be able to fish year-round in the future.

    浙江和广东东部渔民组织起来提高了生产
    浙江省和广东省粤东区沿海渔民，已逐步组织起来进行生产。浙江沿海渔民组织了一千七百多个互助组和三个合作社，参加的渔船有五千一百多只，渔民二万二千多人，占一九五三年春汛出海渔民百分之三十五点五。粤东区已组织起大小渔船二千多只，约占总数百分之十五。其中包括?船二十五艚（每艚有船二、三十只，两百人左右集体进行生产），有渔民互助组二百八十七个。组织起来后，由于生产工具齐全，劳动生产率大为提高。粤东区很多渔民互助组去年九、十两月的捕鱼量都超过一九五二年全年捕鱼量。浙江临海县项义品渔业生产合作社红头对船的春汛单位产量平均达一万零二百多斤，当地渔民互助组的平均产量只有九千三百多斤，单干渔民才七千五百多斤。过去渔民的习惯是大雾天不出海；组织起来后，创造了“雨伞形挺开法”和“呼应联络法”，在迷天大雾中也能出海捕鱼。粤东南澳县互助合作的?艚改良了工具，找寻捕鱼规律，发现了多处新渔场，增加了捕鱼量。渔区妇女是生产上很大的潜力，但她们过去都很少参加生产，去年春天大黄鱼生产时，中共浙江省舟山地委发动大批妇女参加加工工作，初步做到男捕鱼女加工，有力地支持了渔业生产，同时也增加了渔民的收入。
    渔民们为了扩大生产，普遍添置生产工具。浙江省沿海渔民以自己积累的资金为主，在国家贷款的扶持下，一九五三年新造了二千余只各型船只，参加冬汛生产。粤东广澳乡渔民一九五三年添置了三十多条渔船，不少互助组还添置了两三套不同的捕鱼工具。他们现在正向多样化轮番生产发展，争取将来终年都可以捕鱼。　　　　　　（翟作标）
