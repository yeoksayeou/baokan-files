    On the Contradictions Between Britain and the United States
  　Britain  Du De
    Editor's Note: On October 4, 1953, Du De, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, delivered a report at a meeting of the Economic Committee of the British Communist Party, specifically analyzing the contradictions between Britain and the United States. Published here is a summary of this report. The original was published in the London weekly "World News and Reviews" on October 17, 1953.
    The question of Anglo-American contradictions is of urgent importance today.
    This is not a question of contradictions between the American people and the British people. There is no need for conflict between them; they have established free and equal relations based on respect for national sovereignty. But under their current rulers, Britain and the United States have deep conflicts of interest, and at the same time, there is an unholy reactionary alliance between the rulers of the two countries against their people and against the freedom of the people of the world.
    The problem arising from such a situation is central to all questions concerning the future of world politics and world peace today. First of all, this is a key issue for Britain's economic and political situation and future.
    This contradiction is the contradiction between British imperialism and American imperialism, the contradiction of the interests of the ruling class capitalists, and the contradiction of the national struggle of the British people against American rule and occupation.
    The contradiction between American and British imperialists is the main contradiction in the modern imperialist world. It has developed for decades since the 20th century, and reached its peak after World War II, with American imperialism pursuing world hegemony and launching a full-scale offensive against the British Empire.
    Today, the vast majority of people have a broad awakening to the American threat and opposition to American rule. Imperialist elements of all factions have also changed from the infighting conducted in the past under the guise of alliances to more open conflicts, and have begun to want to rescue Britain from the embrace of the United States. A few years ago, the Communist Party was almost alone in opposing succumbing to American rule. That was the period of the Marshall Plan, when the United States appeared as a benefactor and savior, a kind elder, and the Santa Claus of the world. Now everything has changed. Anti-American sentiment is prevalent in all political parties, newspapers, on the stage, and sometimes even on the BBC.
    Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the issues concerning the current Anglo-American contradictions and the policies that (Britain) should pursue.

      I. Historical Background

    As early as the mid-19th century, in the heyday of Britain's dominance in the world and its monopoly of the world market, when the United States was still only an agricultural country developed by British and foreign capital, Marx and Engels predicted that the era of Britain's industrial world monopoly would come to an end. Later, German and American capitalism would catch up with British capitalism, and the result would be a crisis in the British economy.
    On the eve of the First World War, Britain had already lost its dominant position in industry, but it still dominated the world market and international finance (London was undoubtedly a center), the strength of the British Navy (controlling the world's oceans) was still second to none, and Britain still possessed a vast colonial empire.
    The First World War had a far-reaching impact on the exchange of positions between the United States and Britain.
    British imperialism concentrated all its strength in the First World War to defeat its German enemy, but discovered a new and more powerful enemy. The United States leapt from a debtor nation to a creditor nation. It then occupied a superior position in finance, and the US dollar began to overwhelm the pound sterling. It greatly expanded the strength of its navy and army. British imperialism initially tried to meet this challenge in the years immediately after the First World War, when a large-scale naval expansion race was brewing. However, hit by the economic crisis and stagnation since 1920, British imperialists were unable to cope in the struggle. At the Washington Conference in 1922, they had to accept naval parity and abandon the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Similarly, the restoration of the gold standard in Britain in 1925 was a sign that Britain was trying its best to launch a struggle between the pound sterling and the US dollar. This struggle collapsed with the advent of the world economic crisis in 1931, when New York bankers directed British domestic policy for the first time, demanding that Britain cut unemployment benefits by 10 percent. As a result, the British government succumbed to American pressure.

      World War II

    The Second World War brought decisive changes to the balance of power within the capitalist world. Like the First World War, American monopoly capitalists once again made huge profits. The United States was not damaged by the war and was the last major power to participate in the world war, so it emerged with vigorous armed forces. On the other hand, Britain was exhausted by the war, its markets fell into the hands of American capitalism, most of its shipping was lost, its maritime hegemony was lost, and a large part of its overseas investment was sold off. In contrast, the United States established a huge accumulation of capital in the war, and its expanded productivity is now looking for profitable opportunities for expansion.
    This is how the decisive shifts in the positions of the United States and Britain in the world after World War II arose in terms of industrial production, trade, shipping, overseas investment, and strategic strength.
    There was only one exception to this advantage of the United States at the end of World War II, and that was in terms of colonial possessions. Britain still maintained an empire that occupied a quarter of the world's territory. The United States, in comparison, had only limited direct colonies.
    Such a situation often creates the main basis for imperialist conflict. The United States' commitment to world expansion is not a special policy of this or that politician, but a reflection of the laws of monopolistic capitalism. The trend of expansion of American monopoly capital is aimed at the whole world; ultimately at socialist and people's democratic countries; but at present, it is primarily aimed at the existing British colonial empire and the colonial empires of Western Europe, which is the struggle for the redivision of the world by imperialism. Just as Hitler loudly clamored for his anti-Soviet and anti-communist war preparations, and under this guise launched an offensive against Britain and France and their empires, and first attacked the West, the United States is also conducting its openly declared "Cold War" against the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and communism, while actually conducting a secret "Cold War" against the British Empire.

      The American Offensive

    The mode of the American offensive, at this stage, is not the mode of a direct main force battle for the redivision of the world, although they have already prepared the way for it with localized wars of aggression like the one launched in Korea. Their main method is to use their superior economic, financial, and strategic strength to force a large number of countries to surrender without a fight through alliances, "aid," and bribery of governments, and to expand their influence and rule in these countries. This "aid" in fact harms the countries receiving aid and reduces them to the status of vassal states.
    The developments of the eight years from 1945 to 1953 after the war have shown that these weapons are being continued and expanded:
      (1) The termination of the Lend-Lease Act and loans to Britain with "non-discrimination" conditions, etc.
      (2) The Truman Doctrine launched an offensive in the Middle East.
      (3) The Marshall Plan dragged Western Europe into the American economic system.
    (4) The Havana Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the attack on imperial preferences.
      (5) The North Atlantic Treaty and the occupation of military bases in Britain and Western Europe.
      (6) Forcing the devaluation of the pound sterling.
      (7) The Korean War and forcing all vassal states to carry out devastating arms expansion.
      (8) Forcing the implementation of trade restrictions and the Battle Act to bind the economies of countries related to the source of dollars and the dollar market.
      (9) Conducting a direct offensive by infiltrating the colonial empires through the World Bank, Point Four Program, and bilateral treaties, and weakening the economies of major raw material producing countries by hoarding and ceasing to purchase raw materials, thereby increasing their dependence on the United States.
      (10) Alienating Britain's autonomous territories, first bringing Canada and then Australia and New Zealand into the American orbit through the ANZUS Treaty.

    II. American Invasion of Britain and the British Empire

    In these years, it has reached a stage where it can be said that the American world empire has emerged. The American writer Victor Perlo, in his book "American Imperialism" published in 1951, estimated that in 1947, 563 million people were under American colonial or semi-colonial rule or military occupation. This number would be even larger now, and this estimate does not include the countries of Western Europe that are in fact under American rule.
    American rule over Britain is already very deep. In all the years after the war, from 1945 to 1953, every British government has been subsidized by the United States. Since 1948, Britain has been under American military occupation and has been publicly declared as a base available in American strategic plans.
    British trade and economy have been constrained by the non-discrimination clauses of the loan agreements and trade restrictions.
    The total amount of American capital invasion is kept secret, but it is said to be quite considerable. The US Department of Commerce report "Direct Investments in Foreign Countries" stated in 1951 that US direct investment in the United Kingdom had increased from $519 million in 1943 to $840 million, or £300 million, in 1950. This definitely does not include the total amount of the invasion.
    In terms of political control, it can be said that all the major decisions of the government in recent years have been made under American suggestions and pressure.
    The American invasion of the British Empire is equally severe. This is particularly evident in trade, with the American invasion of the imperial market rapidly expanding. What is important is that Britain's position in India as India's main importing country has been replaced, with the first place falling into the hands of the United States. The amount of capital invasion can be seen in the materials published in the December 1952 issue of "American Business Conditions Digest," which pointed out that between 1945 and 1950, US direct investment in the British colonies of Australia and South Africa increased from £257 million to £463 million. The official statistics of US overseas assets in 1950 showed that three-fifths of the total overseas assets of 34 billion US dollars were in the British Empire or other Western European empires.
    The actual situation in various regions further illustrates this invasion. Canada has become an American protectorate. Australia and New Zealand have been brought into the American orbit by the ANZUS Treaty, which excludes Britain. In India, although British capital still occupies a dominant position in the possession of major assets and resources, the United States has gained an advantage in trade and is expanding its economic, financial, and political invasion. In South Africa and Africa, the American invasion is particularly active. In the Middle East, Britain still had an advantage at the end of World War II, but is now yielding to the United States. At the end of World War II, Britain held controlling positions in Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Greece, and Cyprus, and with the decline of France, also held controlling positions in Syria and Lebanon. Today, Britain only maintains its advantage in Jordan, Iraq, and Cyprus. The United States has brought the Arab countries, Israel, Turkey, and Greece into its sphere of influence, and is expanding its influence in Syria through the dictatorship of Shishakli, in Egypt through supporting the dictatorship of Naguib, and in Iran through the dictatorship of Saidi.
    The purpose of American policy is undoubtedly to completely conquer the British Empire not nominally but substantially. The Point Four Program is particularly aimed at the countries belonging to the British Empire.
    The Paley Report has drawn up a blueprint for making the major raw material producing countries of the colonies suitable for the needs of American monopoly capital. The Paley Report estimates the US demand for raw materials, saying: The United States produced 15 percent more raw materials than needed in 1900; in 1950, production was 9 percent lower than demand; and in 1975, production will be 20 percent lower than demand. The report therefore formulated a plan to seize raw materials from overseas countries, that is, the colonial countries belonging to other empires, in accordance with "Special Resource Agreements," guaranteeing the rights and privileges of American monopoly capitalism in these countries.
    Similarly, the strategic outposts and bases of the American army are established in accordance with the routes to control all transportation hubs of the British Empire.
    In this way, the British Empire has fallen into the position of a vassal empire, just as Lenin described in "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," the Portuguese Empire was once a vassal state of the British Empire.

    论英美矛盾
  　英国  杜德
    编者按：一九五三年十月四日，英国共产党执行委员会副主席杜德在英国共产党经济委员会会议上作了一个报告，具体地分析了英美之间所存在的矛盾。这里发表的是杜德这个报告的摘要。原文登载在一九五三年十月十七日伦敦“世界新闻与评论”周刊上。
    英美矛盾问题在今天具有急迫的重要性。
    这并不是美国人民和英国人民之间的矛盾的问题。他们之间是没有冲突的必要的，他们曾建立了基于尊重国家主权的自由平等的关系。但是英国和美国在其现在的统治者统治下，有着深刻的利害冲突，而同时在两国的统治者之间又有着一个并不美妙的反对它们的人民以及反对全世界人民自由的反动联盟。
    从这样的局势而产生的问题，是有关今天世界政治以及世界和平前途的一切问题的中心。首先，这是英国的经济和政治局势与前途的关键问题。
    这种矛盾就是英国帝国主义和美国帝国主义之间的矛盾，是统治阶级资本家利益的矛盾，以及英国人民反对美国统治和占领的民族斗争的矛盾。
    美英帝国主义者之间的矛盾，是现代帝国主义世界中的主要矛盾。它在二十世纪以来就已发展了几十年，而在第二次世界大战后，随着美国帝国主义追求世界霸权和对英帝国进行全面的进攻而达到了顶点。
    今天广大人民对于美国威胁和反对美国统治已有一种广泛的觉醒。各派的帝国主义分子也已从过去在联盟的形式掩盖下进行的暗斗，改变为更形公开的冲突，并且开始想要把英国从美国的怀抱中解救出来。几年以前，共产党几乎是单独地在反对向美国的统治屈服。那就是马歇尔计划的时期，那时候美国是以施主与救命恩人、善心长者和全世界的圣诞老人的面貌出现的。现在一切都变了样了。反美情绪普遍地存在在英国的所有政党中、报纸里、舞台上，有时甚至在英国广播公司的节目中。
    因此，有必要把有关目前英美矛盾的问题，以及（英国）应当追循的政策弄个清楚。
      一、历史背景
    远在十九世纪中叶，英国称霸世界和垄断世界市场的极盛时代，美国还仅仅是一个被英国和外国资本开拓的农业国家，马克思和恩格斯就预言，英国工业的世界垄断时代将会告终，其后，德国和美国的资本主义将赶上英国的资本主义，结果就会造成英国经济的危机。
    第一次世界大战前夕，英国就已丧失了在工业上的独霸地位，但是仍然主宰着世界市场和国际金融（伦敦无疑是一个中心），英国海军的实力（操纵着世界各大海洋）仍然是首屈一指，英国还拥有着一个庞大的殖民帝国。
    第一次世界大战对于美国和英国地位的对调产生了久远的影响。
    英国帝国主义在第一次世界大战中集中了它的全副力量去击败它的德国敌人，却发现了一个新的和更强大的敌手。美国从一个债务国一跃而变成为一个债权国。它进而占了金融上的优越地位，美元开始压倒英镑。它大大地扩展了海军和陆军的实力。英国帝国主义起初在第一次世界大战刚结束后的年代中力图迎接这一挑战，当时正酝酿一个大规模的扩张海军的竞赛。但是，随着遭到自一九二○年起的经济危机和停滞的打击，英国帝国主义者在斗争中便无法招架了。在一九二二年的华盛顿会议中，他们不得不接受了海军均势，放弃英日同盟。同样的，一九二五年在英国恢复了金本位，正表示英国极力展开英镑对美元的斗争。这一斗争随着一九三一年世界经济危机的来临而宣告瓦解，那时候，纽约的银行家便第一次指挥英国的国内的政策，要英国削减百分之十的失业救济金，结果是英国政府在美国压力下甘拜下风。
      第二次世界大战
    第二次世界大战给资本主义世界内部关系的均势带来了决定性的改变。就像第一次世界大战一样，美国的垄断资本家再一次获得了巨额的利润。美国没有受到战争的破坏，并是最后一个参加世界战争的强国，因此又挟着元气锐足的武装力量而出现。在另一方面，英国却在战争中弄得筋疲力竭，市场落入美国资本主义之手，大部分航运丧失掉了，海上霸权丧失掉了，它的很大一部分的海外投资出卖掉了。与此相反，美国在战争中建立起资本的巨大积累，还有它那扩大了的生产力，现在正在找寻有利可图的扩张的机会。
    第二次世界大战后美国和英国在世界中的地位，在工业生产、贸易、航运、海外投资和战略实力各方面的决定性的转变就是这样产生的。
    美国在第二次世界大战结束时的这种优势只有
  一个例外，就是在殖民地占有方面。英国仍然保持拥有一个版图占了四分之一个世界的帝国。美国比较起来只有有限的一些直接的殖民地。
    这样的一种形势经常造成帝国主义冲突的主要基础。美国致力于世界扩张并不是这一个或那一个政治家的特殊政策，而是垄断性的资本主义法则的反映。美国垄断资本的扩张趋势是针对着全世界的；最终是针对社会主义和人民民主的国家的；但是目前首先是针对现存的不列颠殖民帝国和西欧各殖民帝国，那就是帝国主义重新瓜分世界的斗争。正如希特勒大事叫嚷其反苏反共的备战活动，而在这个幌子掩盖下对英国和法国及其帝国进行进攻，而且首先向西方下手，美国也是这样进行着它对苏联、人民民主国家和共产主义的公开宣扬的“冷战”，而实际上则进行着对英帝国的秘密的“冷战”。
      美国的攻势
    美国的攻势的方式，在现阶段并不是重分世界的直接的主力战的方式，虽然他们已经以像在朝鲜所发动的局部的侵略战争为其准备了道路。他们的主要的方法是利用他们优越的经济、财政和战略的实力，通过缔盟、“援助”和收买各国政府的方式，迫使一大批国家不战而降，并在这些国家中扩展其势力和统治，这种“援助”事实上是损害接受援助的国家，并使它们降为附庸国的地位。
    战后从一九四五年至一九五三年这八年来的发展，已显示了这些武器被继续和扩大使用着：
      （一）租借法案的终止和附有“不得歧视”条件的对英贷款，等等。
      （二）杜鲁门主义展开了在中东的攻势。
      （三）马歇尔计划把西欧拉进美国的经济体系之中。
    （四）哈瓦那贸易协定和关税贸易总协定以及对帝国特惠制的进攻。
      （五）北大西洋公约以及在英国和西欧的军事基地占领。
      （六）迫使英镑贬值。
      （七）朝鲜战争和迫使所有附庸国进行毁灭性的扩军。
      （八）强迫施行贸易限制和巴特尔法，以束缚与美元源泉和美元市场有关的各国的经济。
      （九）通过世界银行、第四点计划、双边条约进行渗入殖民帝国的直接进攻，以及利用囤积和停止购买原料手段削弱主要原料出产国的经济，从而增加它们对美国的依赖。
      （十）离间英国的自治领，首先把加拿大，然后通过美澳新公约把澳大利亚和新西兰纳入美国的轨道。
    二、美国对英国和英帝国的入侵
    在这些年间，已达到了这样的一个阶段，就是可以说美国的世界帝国已经出现。美国作家维多·贝尔鲁在他于一九五一年出版的“美国帝国主义”一书中，估计到一九四七年已有五亿六千三百万人民处于美国的殖民地或半殖民地统治或者军事占领之下。现在这个数字会更加大了，而且这一估计并未包括事实上已处于美国统治下的西欧各国在内。
    美国对英国的统治已经很深。战后从一九四五年到一九五三年所有的年代中，每届英国政府都受美国的津贴。从一九四八年起，英国就在美国的军事占领之下，并被公开宣称为美国战略计划中可用的基地。
    英国贸易和经济已被贷款协定的不得歧视的条款和贸易限制所钳制。
    美国资本入侵的总数是秘而不宣的，但是据悉已颇为可观了。美国商务部的报告“在外国的直接投资”，在一九五一年称，美国在联合王国的直接投资已从一九四三年的五亿一千九百万美元增加到了一九五○年的八亿四千万美元，或三亿英镑。这绝对没有包括入侵的全部数额。
    在政治支配方面，可以说近年来政府的一切主要决定，都是在美国暗示和压力下作出的。
    美国对英帝国的入侵也是同样厉害的。这特别显著地表现在贸易方面，美国对帝国市场的侵略迅速扩大。重要的是：英国在印度作为印度的主要输入国的地位被代替了，第一把交椅落入美国手中。资本入侵的数量，可见于一九五二年十二月的“美国商情要览”所载的材料中，它指出一九四五年至一九五○年间美国在英国殖民地澳大利亚和南非的直接投资从二亿五千七百万英镑增加到了四亿六千三百万英镑。一九五○年美国海外资产官方统计表显示，总额达三百四十亿美元的海外资产有五分之三是在英帝国或其他西欧帝国内。
    各个地区的实况更说明了这种入侵。加拿大已变成为一个美国的被保护国。澳大利亚和新西兰已被把英国排斥在外的美澳新公约纳入美国的轨道中。在印度，虽然英国资本仍然在主要资产和资源的占有中居于支配地位，美国已在贸易中赢得了优势，并正在扩张其经济、金融和政治的入侵。在南非和非洲，美国的入侵尤其活跃。在中东，英国在第二次世界大战结束时还占着优势，现在要让位给美国了。在第二次世界大战结束的时候，英国在埃及、巴勒斯坦、约旦、伊拉克、伊朗、希腊和塞浦路斯握有控制的地位，而且随着法国的衰落，在叙利亚和黎巴嫩也握有控制的地位。今天英国只在约旦、伊拉克和塞浦路斯维持它的优势，美国已把阿拉伯诸国、以色列、土耳其、希腊纳入它的势力范围，而且通过施舍克里的独裁在叙利亚扩张其势力，通过支持纳吉布的独裁在埃及扩张其势力，通过萨希迪的独裁而在伊朗扩张其势力。
    美国政策的目的无疑是为了要对英帝国不是在名义上而是在实质上的完全征服。第四点计划特别是针对着英帝国所属的各国的。
    派莱报告已制出了使殖民地原料主要出产国适合美国垄断资本的需求的计划的蓝图。派莱报告估计美国对原料的需求说：美国在一九○○年生产的原料超出所需百分之十五；一九五○年生产低于需求百分之九；一九七五年生产将低于需求百分之二十。该报告因此制订了攫取海外国家的原料的计划，就是说，其它帝国所属的各殖民地国家，按照“特别资源协定”，保证美国垄断资本主义在这些国家活动的权利与特权。
    同样地，美国军队的战略前哨与基地，是按照控制英帝国的全部交通孔道的途径建立起来了。
    这样，英帝国就沦于附庸帝国的地位，正和列宁在“帝国主义是资本主义底最高阶段”中所描述的，葡萄牙帝国曾是英帝国的附庸国的地位一样。
                                      （未完）
