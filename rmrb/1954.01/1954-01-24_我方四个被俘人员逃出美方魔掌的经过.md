Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 23rd:

More than ninety captured Korean and Chinese personnel who escaped while being escorted by the US forces each have their own different terrifying experiences. From these facts, one can see the US armed forces' and secret agents' violent control over the prisoners of war, as well as the prisoners' resolute will to be repatriated.

The reporter interviewed Wang Zhongxin, one of the returnees, who was almost caught by the US military police during his escape. He said that on the day of departure from the camp, the secret agents forced him to carry a large flag and assigned a "squad leader" to watch him from behind. When he reached a small hillside, Wang Zhongxin deliberately loosened his shoes, and while squatting down to put them on, he turned around and told the "squad leader," "My shoes came off, you go ahead." As soon as the "squad leader" passed him, Wang Zhongxin took off running out of the line. At this moment, an American military policeman and two Taiwanese secret agents chased after him to grab him. In a moment of urgency, he swung the flagpole in his hand a few times, knocking the unsuspecting American military policeman and secret agents to the ground. Wang Zhongxin took advantage of this gap to run to the side of the Indian soldiers.

Zhang Huanhuan, another returnee, was a disabled person living in the US military's 64th Field Hospital. At 9:00 PM on the 20th, the secret agents forced the wounded and sick prisoners of war onto American "ambulances" that drove directly into the camp, with secret agents monitoring each vehicle. After the vehicle drove out of the third barbed wire fence, Zhang Huanhuan saw the Indian guard troops going through "handover" procedures with the US military police through the crack in the car door. He suddenly twisted open the car door, jumped out of the carriage with his crutches, and ran north. An American lieutenant colonel rushed up and shouted, "Don't go!" Zhang Huanhuan ignored him and desperately climbed up a small hill. At this time, another Kuomintang secret agent came and shouted, "Where are you going?" Zhang Huanhuan, seeing the situation was not good, limped and hurried to the place where several Indian army jeeps were parked on the other side of the hill. When the Indian driver helped him into the car, this disabled person, who had experienced a thrilling ordeal, could not move at all! Zhang Huanhuan said that he was captured last summer, and all the flesh on his left arm was cut off by shrapnel. The US military had not given him proper treatment, and he has not recovered to this day.

Li Guanghui, another returnee, also escaped after being loaded onto an American truck. Due to excessive fright, his lips were still trembling when he returned to Panmunjom. At about 1:00 PM on the 20th, after he and other captured personnel were driven out of the camp by Kuomintang secret agents, he was pushed onto an American truck by the secret agents. Realizing that he had reached the door of death, he rolled off the truck regardless of everything. Two secret agents monitoring him also jumped down, grabbed him, hit his head with wooden sticks, and desperately dragged him back onto the truck. At this time, Li Guanghui, regardless of the pain, wrestled with the secret agents on the ground, and finally ran to the side of an Indian soldier.

A Korean People's Army prisoner of war, Hong Dabiao, was starved for seven days by secret agents in the camp for revealing his desire to be repatriated. When leaving the camp, he was escorted by seven secret agents armed with wooden sticks, all of which were nailed with knives. But he still took the opportunity to risk his life and escape.

### 我方四个被俘人员逃出美方魔掌的经过

    我方四个被俘人员逃出美方魔掌的经过
    【新华社开城二十三日电】在美方押走战俘时逃出来的九十多名朝中被俘人员，每个人都有他自己不同的恐怖经历。从这些事实中可以看出，美方武装力量和特务对战俘的强暴控制以及战俘要求遣返的坚决意志。
    记者访问过一位名叫王忠信的归来人员，他在逃跑时差一点被美军宪兵抓去。他说，那天出营场时特务们强迫他拿着一面大旗，派了一个“小队长”在后面监视着他。走到一个小山坡上，王忠信故意摔脱了自己的鞋子，一面蹲下来穿鞋，一面回头告诉“小队长”说：“我的鞋脱了，你先走一步吧。”“小队长”刚从他身边走过，王忠信拔腿就跑出了行列。这时，路旁一个美国宪兵和两个台湾特务就追过来抓他。他心中一急，抡起手中的旗杆猛扫几下，把没有提防的美国宪兵和特务打倒在地上，王忠信趁这个空隙跑到了印度兵旁边。
    归来人员张焕焕是一个住在美军六十四野战医院里的残废者。二十日晚上九点钟，特务们把伤病战俘强迫抬上了直接开进营场的美国“救护车”，每个车里都有特务监视着。车子开出了第三道铁丝网，张焕焕从车门缝里看见印度看管部队正在和美国宪兵办“移交”手续，他就猛一下扭开车门，凭着拐杖跳出车厢，往北奔跑。一个美军中校当时急追上来喊道：“不要走！”张焕焕不理他，拚命爬上了一个小山丘。这时，又有一个国民党特务赶来喊道：“你往那里走？”张焕焕看情形不妙，一颠一跛地急忙跑到小丘那边停着几辆印度部队吉普车的地方。在印军司机扶他上车时，这个经历了一场惊险的残废者一点也不能动弹了！张焕焕说，他是在去年夏天被俘的，当时左臂的肉全部被炮弹片削去，美军一直没有给予妥善治疗，至今没有痊愈。
    另一个归来人员李光辉也是在被押上美国卡车以后才逃回来的。由于过度的惊骇，他在回到板门店时还嘴唇颤抖。二十日下午一时许，他和其他被俘人员一道被国民党特务赶出营场以后，又被特务架着推上了美国卡车。他意识到已经到了死亡的门口，就不顾一切滚下了卡车。两个监视他的特务分子也跟着跳下来，揪住他，用木棒猛击他的头，并拚命把他往车上拖。这时，李光辉也不顾什么疼痛在地上和特务扭着，连滚带爬地终于跑到了一个印度兵身边。
    有一个朝鲜人民军战俘洪达杓因泄露了他想遣返的愿望，曾被营场内的特务饿了七天，出营场时有七个手执木棒的特务分子押着，那些木棒上都钉着刀子。可是他还是乘机冒死逃了出来。
