Adhere to the policy of conducting thorough ideological mobilization work
Hubei corrects the tendency in some areas to seek quick results in grain purchasing

In the grain purchasing work in Hubei Province, some areas once exhibited a tendency to seek quick results in a simplistic manner. The Party committees at all levels in Hubei Province have seriously corrected this, requiring all localities to earnestly implement the policy of conducting thorough ideological mobilization in grain purchasing.

The grain purchasing work in most areas of Hubei Province has progressed very smoothly, but in some areas, there was a tendency some time ago to neglect ideological mobilization, seek quick results, and adopt simple and rigid working methods. For example, village cadres and activists in Erwu Village, Yingcheng County, returned to the village after attending a meeting in the county, held a mass meeting in the evening to talk about it, and then busied themselves with grain purchasing the next day. Because they did not conduct sufficient ideological mobilization, the grain purchasing work could not be carried out smoothly. These cadres did not delve into ideological education work, but instead insisted on Communist Party members and activists taking the lead in selling grain. Three out of twelve Party members who lacked grain borrowed grain to sell, and the director of the township women's federation took the lead in selling eight *shi* of rice, and then had to go to the cooperative to buy grain to eat. This caused ideological confusion among the masses, and some peasants said: "We can't learn from their way of selling." Working cadres in Yichang Township, Tongshan County, did not actively publicize the state's grain purchasing policy to the peasants, nor did they refute the rumors spread by bad elements, but instead prepared to use coercive methods to purchase grain. There were also working cadres in some areas who were eager to mobilize the masses to sell grain the day after arriving in the township, or while conducting propaganda, they immediately organized the masses to send grain, attempting to "complete the task" in two or three days, but as a result, the grain purchasing work could not be carried out smoothly.

In order to correct and prevent deviations in grain purchasing, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee issued an emergency instruction on December 15th of last year regarding continuing to deeply mobilize the masses to complete the grain purchasing task. The instruction specifically put forward three guidelines: fully conduct ideological mobilization, correctly implement policies, and leading cadres at all levels must conduct in-depth roving inspections and correct deviations in a timely manner. It required all local committees and county committees to earnestly implement these guidelines to ensure that they could both purchase grain and unite and educate the peasants.

At present, Party committees at all levels in Hubei Province are earnestly implementing this instruction from the Hubei Provincial Party Committee. The Jingzhou Prefectural Party Committee, Xiaogan Prefectural Party Committee, and Xiaogan County Party Committee have all held emergency meetings to study the instructions of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, review the grain purchasing work in the previous period, and determine measures to implement the instructions. The Macheng County Party Committee, led by the county party secretary, went to various townships to inspect the grain purchasing work and timely corrected the impatience and other emotions of some cadres. The district party secretaries of the Hanchuan County districts, after attending the emergency meeting held by the county party committee, have convened district and township cadre meetings to convey and implement the instructions of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee. The expanded meeting of district and township cadres in the first district of Chongyang County required all cadres in the district to earnestly use the method of conducting in-depth ideological mobilization to carry out grain purchasing work, and the vice chairman of Xiajin Township introduced his own experience in deeply mobilizing peasants at the meeting. In areas where the grain purchasing work had taken a detour, many have corrected the deviations such as simply seeking quick results, and the grain purchasing work has begun to develop normally.

    坚持进行充分的思想动员工作的方针
    湖北纠正部分地区购粮中简单图快的偏向
    湖北省收购粮食工作中，部分地区一度发生简单图快的偏向，中共湖北省各级党委已认真加以纠正，要求各地在购粮中认真贯彻充分进行思想动员的方针。
    湖北省大部地区购粮工作进展得很顺利，但有部分地区在前些日子发生了忽视思想动员、急性图快、工作方式简单生硬的偏向。如应城县二屋村村干部、积极分子从县里开会回村，晚上召开个群众大会一讲，第三天就忙着购粮。由于没有进行充分的思想动员，购粮工作便不能顺利展开。这些干部不去深入进行思想教育工作，却硬叫共产党员、积极分子带头卖粮。十二个党员中有三个缺粮的出去借粮卖，乡妇女联合会主任把八石稻谷带头卖光了，接着就要到合作社去买粮吃。这样就引起了群众的思想混乱，有的农民说：“像他们这个卖法，我们没法学。”通山县易场乡工作干部不去积极向农民宣传国家购粮政策，和粉碎坏分子散布的谣言，而是准备用强迫命令的办法购粮。还有部分地区的工作干部到乡第二天就急着动员群众卖粮，或者一面宣传，一面就组织群众送粮，企图两三天“完成任务”，结果却使购粮工作不能顺利展开。
    为了纠正和防止购粮中的偏向，中共湖北省委会于去年十二月十五日发出了关于继续深入发动群众完成购粮任务的紧急指示。指示中具体提出了充分进行思想动员，正确贯彻政策，和各级领导干部必须深入巡回检查，发现偏差及时纠正等三项方针，要求各地委、县委认真加以贯彻，保证既能收购到粮食又能团结和教育农民。
    目前，中共湖北省各级党委正在认真贯彻湖北省委的这一指示。中共荆州地委、孝感地委、孝感县委等都召开了紧急会议，学习中共湖北省委的指示，检查前一段购粮工作，确定了贯彻指示的措施。中共麻城县委以县委书记为首，分头深入各乡检查购粮工作，及时纠正了部分干部的急躁等情绪。中共汉川县各区区委书记参加过县委召开的紧急会议后，已召开区、乡干部会议传达、贯彻了湖北省委的指示。崇阳县第一区区、乡干部扩大会议要求全区干部认真用深入进行思想动员的方法进行购粮工作，并由下津乡副主席在会上介绍了他自己如何深入发动农民的经验。在购粮中走了弯路的地区，许多已纠正了简单图快等偏向，购粮工作开始正常发展。　　（陈帆等）
