　　Great achievements have been made in the work of preferential treatment for families of servicemen in the vast rural areas of Northeast China, along with the development of agricultural production.

　　Governments at all levels in Northeast China attach particular importance to mobilizing and organizing families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers to participate in agricultural production, and helping them establish their households and solve difficulties in production. Before the spring plowing last year, all localities concentrated on using preferential treatment funds to help families of martyrs, families of soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers add carts and buy horses. After they had the means of production, their enthusiasm for production greatly increased, and many people participated in mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives. In Jianchang and Chaoyang Counties in Rehe Province, 1,045 families of martyrs and soldiers participated in mutual aid teams, and 44 families participated in agricultural production cooperatives. In the Ninth District of Bin County, Songjiang Province, more than 90 percent of families of martyrs and soldiers participated in mutual aid teams. They are all very enthusiastic about production in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and many have become the backbone of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and have been selected as labor models. Wang Guizhi, a model family member of a serviceman in Longhua County, Rehe Province, has been leading a mutual aid team since 1950, and last spring she was elected as the deputy director of an agricultural production cooperative. The mutual aid team led by Ma Chunfa, a demobilized soldier in Shifo Village, Jianchang County, has been upgraded to an agricultural production cooperative, and he himself was elected as a village people's representative in the general election.

　　While mobilizing the families of martyrs and soldiers to participate in production, various localities also rectified the work of substituting for farming. Last year, Northeast China substituted for the farming of more than 477,000 hectares (each hectare is equal to 15 mu) of paddy fields and dry land for families of martyrs and soldiers who had no or lacked labor and livestock. In order to urge all localities to carry out cultivation in a timely and meticulous manner, governments at all levels sent cadres to conduct inspections several times. The Civil Affairs Department of Songjiang Province organized a total of 18 groups to go to 29 counties for inspection, which effectively promoted the work of substituting for farming. There have also been new changes in the methods of substituting for farming in various places. In areas with a better foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, mutual aid and cooperative organizations have become the basic form in combination with the work of substituting for farming. For example, in Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces, mutual aid and cooperative organizations are responsible for cultivating 80 to 90 percent of the total area of ​​land for which farming is substituted. While improving the method of substituting for farming, various localities also universally reformed the farming method. In areas where the patriotic bumper harvest movement was carried out in Liaodong Province, doing a good job in substituting for farming was listed as one of the conditions for competition. The fertilizer application area of ​​substituted farming land in Jilin Province has reached 80 percent. Jilin, Liaodong and other provinces promoted Guo Houqi's (Zhaoyuan County) bumper harvest experience on more than half of the substituted farming land, and established many high-yield fields to ensure the continuous increase in the yield of the land of families of martyrs and soldiers. Some families of martyrs and soldiers have gradually been able to produce enough for themselves under the care of the people's government and with the help of the masses over the past few years, so they have declined substituted farming, reducing the burden of substituting for farming for the masses.

　　After demobilized and transferred soldiers in various places obtained land and houses and established their households, they actively participated in agricultural production and other social activities. For example, 90 percent of demobilized and transferred soldiers in Shuangyang County, Jilin Province, participated in mutual aid teams, and some also served as team leaders. 78 percent of demobilized and transferred soldiers in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, participated in militia organizations, and many were elected as cadres. Many demobilized and transferred soldiers who returned to Jilin Province became district chiefs, village chiefs, people's representatives, and production models. In the third, fourth, and fifth districts of Yongji County alone, 28 village cadres were demobilized and transferred soldiers. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　The people of Wuhan City are actively carrying out the Spring Festival support-the-army and preferential treatment work. At present, the people of the city are writing letters to the Chinese and Korean People's Troops and the Korean people, reporting on the major achievements in the country's various constructions and the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen in the past year. The Spring Festival慰问队 (comfort team), organized by people from all walks of life in Wuhan, has begun to慰问 (express sympathy and solicitude) the recuperating members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, disabled revolutionary soldiers, families of revolutionary martyrs, and families of revolutionary soldiers since January 23. Some young people and women in the streets have also spontaneously organized to express their sympathy and solicitude to the families of martyrs and soldiers. On January 30, the city will hold a 2,000-person army-government-people celebration meeting. At the meeting, representatives of the Fifth General Sub-Delegation of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea will be invited to make a report. During the Spring Festival, various districts will also hold army-government-people celebration meetings or symposiums for families of martyrs and soldiers. At the meeting, the opinions of families of martyrs and soldiers will be solicited in order to improve future preferential treatment work.

　　At the same time, the organs and troops stationed in Wuhan under the Central and South China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army launched a campaign to support the government and cherish the people on January 25. During the Spring Festival, in addition to checking the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people in the past year, they are also preparing to hold celebrations with local governments, families of martyrs and soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers.

　　东北农村优抚工作已获很大成就
　　武汉市人民积极开展春节拥军优属工作
    东北广大农村的优抚工作，随着农业生产的发展，已获得很大成就。
    东北各级人民政府特别重视发动与组织革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人参加农业生产，并帮助他们建立家务和解决生产上的困难。去年春耕前，各地都集中使用了优抚事业费，帮助烈属、军属和革命残废军人、复员转业军人添车买马。他们有了生产资料后，生产积极性大大提高，许多人参加了互助组或农业生产合作社。热河省建昌、朝阳两县就有一千零四十五户烈属、军属参加了互助组，有四十四户参加了农业生产合作社。松江省宾县九区有百分之九十以上的烈属、军属参加了互助组。他们在互助合作组织中的生产情绪都很饱满，有许多人已成为互助合作运动中的骨干分子，并被选为劳动模范。热河省隆化县模范军属王桂芝从一九五零年就领导一个互助组，去年春天她又当选为农业生产合作社的副主任。建昌县石佛村复员军人麻春发领导的互助组已提高为农业生产合作社，他本人在普选中又当选为村人民代表。
    各地在发动烈属、军属参加生产的同时，对代耕工作也进行了整顿。去年，东北各地共给没有或缺少劳力、畜力的烈属、军属代耕了水田、旱田四十七万七千多垧（每垧合十五市亩）。为了督促各地适时、细致地进行耕作，各级人民政府曾几次派出干部进行检查。松江省民政厅先后共组织十八个组分赴二十九个县进行检查，有力地推动了代耕工作。各地代耕方式也有了新的转变，在互助合作基础较好的地区，互助合作组织结合代耕工作已成为基本形式。如松江、黑龙江两省，由互助合作组织负责代耕的土地已占代耕土地总面积的百分之八十到九十。与改进代耕方式的同时，各地还普遍改革了耕作方法。辽东省开展了爱国丰产运动的地区，都把做好代耕工作列为竞赛条件之一。吉林省代耕地的施肥面积已达百分之八十。吉林、辽东等省在二分之一以上的代耕地上推广了郭后旗（肇源县）的丰产经验，并建立了很多丰产田，保证了烈属、军属土地的产量不断增加。有些烈属、军属几年来在人民政府的照顾与群众的帮助下，逐渐能够生产自给，因而谢绝代耕，减轻了群众的代耕负担。
    各地复员转业军人获得了土地、房屋，建立了家务后，都积极参加农业生产和其它社会活动。如吉林省双阳县百分之九十的复员转业军人参加了互助组，有的还担任互助组长。黑龙江省海伦县百分之七十八的复员转业军人参加了民兵组织，很多人被选为干部。回到吉林省的复员转业军人，很多人当上区长、村长、人民代表和生产模范，仅永吉县第三、第四、第五三个区就有二十八名村干部是复员转业军人。    （新华社）
    武汉市人民积极开展春节拥军优属工作。目前，全市人民正纷纷给中朝人民部队和朝鲜人民写信，报告过去一年来国家各项建设中的重大成就和拥军优属工作的情况。由武汉市各界人民组织的春节慰问队，已从一月二十三日开始向中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的休养员、革命残废军人、革命烈士家属和革命军人家属进行慰问。有些街道的青年、妇女还自动组织起来到烈属、军属家里慰问。一月三十日，该市将举行一个两千人的军、政、民联欢大会。会上，将邀请中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团第五总分团的代表作报告。在春节期间，各区也将先后召开军、政、民联欢会或烈属、军属座谈会。在会上将征求烈属、军属的意见，以便改进今后优抚工作。
    与此同时，中国人民解放军中南军区驻武汉各机关部队，自一月二十五日起开展了拥政爱民运动。在春节期间，他们除检查一年来的拥政爱民工作外，还准备和当地政府、烈属、军属、革命残废军人进行联欢。    （新华社）
