　　[Report from this newspaper] The direct passenger train between Beijing and Moscow has been decided to officially open on January 31st. Chinese railway workers are enthusiastically carrying out preparatory work.

　　A group of outstanding crew members from the Beijing Railway Administration will assist Soviet crew members on the section from Beijing to Manchuria. They include passenger train conductors, baggage handlers, announcers, dining car service personnel, medical personnel, and translators. Last December, they attended specialized training classes. After the test-run train from Moscow arrived in Beijing, they learned how to use the train's independent heating system and mechanical baggage handling equipment. Passenger train conductor Li Wenyan said: "We are very happy to serve the international friends visiting our country on this train; at the same time, we can also learn a lot from the Soviet crew members." Baggage handler Wang Yuying said: "A few months ago, I saw the news in the newspaper that a direct passenger train would be opened between Beijing and Moscow. At that time, I thought: Whoever gets to work on this train will be honored! I didn't expect that the leadership would assign me to be the baggage handler on this train! I will earnestly learn from the Soviet baggage handlers' spirit of serving passengers and conscientiously manage the baggage on this train, ensuring that it is transported in a timely and complete manner."

　　The chefs who will be working in the dining car held three group meetings in a row to study the menu. They guarantee that there will be no repetition of soups and dishes during the two-day journey. Medical personnel have prepared the sanitary equipment and medicine kits for use on the train. Doctors Liu Yunhua and Cui Shengjia also took a ride on the "Peace" train to specifically understand the needs of passengers. They carefully studied the sanitation and medical work on the train and also discussed how to perform injections, auscultation, and blood pressure measurements while the train is in motion.

　　All crew members are studying Russian diligently to better serve passengers and learn from the Soviet Union.

　　The dispatching, locomotive, crew, and engineering departments of the Beijing, Tianjin, Jinzhou, Harbin, and other railway administrations through which this train passes have also made specific preparations to ensure the safe and accurate operation of this train.

　　北京——莫斯科直达旅客列车月底正式通车
　　我国铁路职工热烈进行准备工作
    【本报讯】北京、莫斯科之间的直达旅客列车，决定于一月三十一日正式通车。我国铁路职工正热烈进行准备工作。
    北京铁路管理局的一批优秀乘务人员，将在从北京到满洲里的一段路上协助苏联乘务人员工作。他们中间有旅客车长、行李员、播音员、餐车服务人员、医务人员和翻译。去年十二月间，他们曾在训练班进行过专门的学习。从莫斯科开来的试运转的列车到达北京以后，他们又学会了使用这趟列车上的独立暖房、机械装卸行李的设备等。旅客车长李文垣说：“我们真高兴到这趟列车上为来访我国的国际友人服务；同时还可向苏联乘务员学习很多东西。”行李员王玉营说：“几个月前我在报纸上看到北京、莫斯科之间将要开行直达旅客列车的消息，那时我想：谁要跑这趟车才光荣呢！没想到现在领导上分配我担任这趟列车的行李员了！我要好好的学习苏联行李员为旅客服务的精神，认真管理这趟列车的行李，保证运送得及时、完整。”
    将在餐车上工作的厨师们，一连开了三次小组会，研究菜单。他们保证在两天的行程中，没有重样的汤、菜。医务人员们准备好了列车上使用的卫生用具和药箱。刘云华、崔升甲两位医生，还特地坐了一次“和平号”列车，专门了解了旅客的需要。他们细心的研究了列车上的卫生、医疗工作，还讨论了在列车行进中如何进行注射、听诊和试血压。
    全体乘务人员为了更好地为旅客服务和向苏联学习，他们正在紧张的学习俄文。
    这趟列车所经过的北京、天津、锦州、哈尔滨等铁路管理局的调度、机务、乘务、工务等部门的职工，也都做了具体的准备工作，保证这趟列车安全、准确地运行。
