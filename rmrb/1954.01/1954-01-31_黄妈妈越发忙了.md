　　Mother Huang is Increasingly Busy
　　Although it is now the slack farming season, Mother Huang has been increasingly busy for the past two months, either studying, doing propaganda work, or attending meetings. She also often takes her subscription of the Sichuan Peasant Newspaper to the village people's government, asking teachers or cadres to read it to her. Indeed, the general line of the state during the transition period has made Mother Huang's heart even more open and bright. She said: "The general line is just like a 'signpost' at a crossroads, guiding everyone to take the bright road of socialism!"
　　Mother Huang is the mother of the volunteer army's Special Class Combat Hero, Huang Jiguang, named Deng Fangzhi, from the Third Village of Jiguang Township, Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province. As early as February 1952, she took the lead in organizing mutual aid teams and actively worked. The news of Huang Jiguang's sacrifice on the Korean front brought sorrow to Mother Huang, but it also increased her strength. During the late summer and early autumn sun, as hot as fire, Mother Huang still labored tirelessly. Every day, as soon as the east turned white, she would wear her old shoes and go to the fields to pull sweet potato vines, not returning until the sun was overhead. Back home, she would either take her daughter-in-law to tear corn husks or finely chop pig feed. As the sun slanted, she would go to the fields to cut grass or catch pests in the cotton fields.
　　Diligent labor has blossomed and borne fruit. Last autumn harvest, her two mu and four fen of paddy fields yielded an average of seven hundred and fifty jin of rice per mu, an increase of eleven percent over the previous year; the one mu of land she participated in the patriotic bumper harvest competition yielded eight hundred and one jin! After the autumn harvest, she selected one dan of the best rice, milled it twice, dried it three times, and took the lead in paying the patriotic public grain, also selling more than two hundred jin of the remaining rice to the purchasing station.
　　On November 24th last year, Jiguang Township held a farmers' meeting to study and discuss the general line of the state during the transition period. The more Mother Huang thought about it, the more she felt that the principles of the general line were correct. She sold all the more than fifty jin of rice and eighteen jin of cotton she had saved at home to the state, and also promoted the benefits of the general line to others. In Jiguang Township, there was a Huang Yuanqi agricultural production mutual aid team, and seven households in the team only planned on how to get rich themselves, unwilling to continue mutual aid and cooperation, and even did not plow the three plowings of the winter water fields. Mother Huang knew that if this continued, the mutual aid team could not be consolidated. She patiently explained to them the benefits of taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and criticized the erroneous idea of only wanting to get rich individually. After repeated explanations, their thinking was straightened out, and the whole team saved more than one hundred and forty jin of cotton to sell to the cooperative, and also formulated a specific winter production plan.

### 黄妈妈越发忙了

　　黄妈妈越发忙了
    虽然已是农闲季节，可是两个月来，黄妈妈越发忙了，不是学习，就是宣传，再不然就是开会。她还常常把她订的那份四川农民报拿到村人民政府，请教师或干部念给她听。的确，国家在过渡时期的总路线使黄妈妈的心里更开朗了。她说：“总路线就好象十字路口的‘指路碑’，指引着大家走社会主义的光明大道！”
    黄妈妈是志愿军特级战斗英雄黄继光烈士的母亲，叫邓芳芝，四川省中江县继光乡三村人。一九五二年二月，她就带头组织了互助组，积极劳动。黄继光在朝鲜前线牺牲的消息，给黄妈妈带来了悲痛，也增加了她的力量。夏末秋初的太阳，象火一样，黄妈妈还是不停地劳动着。每天，东方一发白，她就穿着旧鞋子下地去扯红苕草，太阳当顶才回来。回到家里，不是带着儿媳妇撕包谷壳，便是细刀细刀地切猪草。太阳一打斜，她又到田边去割草，或到棉田里去捉害虫了。
    辛勤的劳动开花结果了。去年秋收时，她的二亩四分水稻田，每亩平均收了七百五十斤谷子，比前年增产了百分之十一；参加爱国丰产竞赛的那一亩地，就收了八百零一斤！秋收后，她就挑选了一石最好的谷子，车了两道，晒了三道，带头缴了爱国公粮，还把二百多斤余下的谷子卖给了收购站。
    去年十一月二十四日，继光乡召开了农民大会，学习和讨论了国家过渡时期的总路线，黄妈妈越想越觉得总路线的道理对，她又把家里节余下来的五十多斤谷子、十八斤棉花全部卖给了国家，还向别人宣传总路线的好处。继光乡有个黄远祺农业生产互助组，组内有七户光打算着自己如何发财，不愿意继续互助合作下去，连冬水田的三遍地也不犁了。黄妈妈知道：这样下去，互助组便不能巩固。她耐心地给他们讲走互助合作道路的好处，批判了光想个人单独发财的错误思想。经过反复的讲解后，他们的思想都通了，全组节约了一百四十多斤棉花卖给了合作社，还订出了冬季的具体生产计划。
