    After studying the general line and general task during the transition period, handicraft workers and artisans in various parts of Hubei Province, under the leadership of the local Communist Party committees, have realized the important significance of the socialist transformation of handicrafts to the country, further clarified their thinking of serving agricultural production, and actively developed production.
    After studying the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, handicraft workers and artisans in various parts of Hubei reached a consensus that only by implementing socialist transformation of handicrafts and taking the road of collectivization can handicrafts overcome difficulties and develop production. Under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, they will work together with the people of the whole country to strive for the transition to a socialist society. Li Dajiang and Feng Zhonghua, representatives of the oil pressing industry in Sui County, said after attending the county's handicrafts representative meeting to study the general line: "We originally thought that with industrialization and machine oil pressing, the traditional wooden presses of handicrafts would not be able to compete. After studying the general line, we realized that industrialization first concentrates on developing heavy industry. A large part of the peasants' production tools and daily necessities still rely on handicrafts for supply. Our responsibility during the transition period is still very significant; after the country is industrialized, handicrafts will undergo socialist transformation and take the road of collectivization, and in the future, they will also use machines for production, and the future is even brighter!" Zhao Yaoting, an ironware handicraft worker in Shashi, said when discussing the general line: "My father and son have always lived by borrowing high-interest loans in the past, with monthly interest rates as low as two percent and as high as five percent, and we could never turn over. Only by taking the road of collectivization can we concentrate funds, develop production, and be free from the exploitation of high-interest loans." Handicraft workers and artisans in Jinkou Town, Wuchang County, realized that processing and ordering goods is a preliminary acceptance of the state's socialist transformation, and understood the principle of implementing the general line with practical actions. They guaranteed to complete the processing and ordering tasks of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives on schedule. The five woodworking businesses in the town, which originally only wanted to find ways to maintain their livelihood in the off-season, felt that the existing finished products could not meet the large needs of grain-selling farmers after studying the general line. They re-formulated their production plans and decided to manufacture 46 loads of manure buckets, 56 pot lids, and 5 loads of water buckets within 20 days. Cao Yongxing's family also plans to produce 10 rakes, 15 plows, 11 harrows, and 4 waterwheels. In order to meet the needs of grain-selling farmers in a timely and adequate manner, five woodworking households in Xinzhou Chengguan Town have increased their workers and purchased a large number of raw materials, first making 100 loads of manure buckets and 120 manure dippers, so that farmers can carry out winter manure accumulation activities. After studying the general line, handicraft workers and artisans in Makou Town, Hanchuan, recognized the important role and bright future of handicrafts during the transition period, and immediately formulated production plans. The ironware industry guaranteed to make 2,050 hoes, 2,020 sickles, and 260 shovels, so that farmers can buy the agricultural tools they need and prepare to develop production after selling their grain.

    湖北省各地手工业工人在学习总路线后
    提高社会主义觉悟积极发展生产
    湖北省各地手工业工人和手工业者，在当地中共党委领导下，通过学习国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，认识到国家对手工业的社会主义改造的重要意义，进一步明确认识了为农业生产服务的思想，积极发展生产。
    湖北各地的手工业工人和手工业者，经过国家过渡时期总路线和总任务的学习，一致认识到只有国家对手工业实行社会主义改造，走合作化的道路，手工业才能克服困难，发展生产，在工人阶级和共产党的领导下，同全国人民一道努力为过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。随县油坊业代表李大江、冯中华出席该县学习总路线的手工业代表会议后，都说：“原来我们以为工业化了，用机器榨油，手工业的木榨吃不开了。学习了总路线，才知道工业化是首先集中主要力量发展重工业。农民的生产工具和日用品，很大部分还要靠手工业供应。我们在过渡时期的责任还是很重大的；国家工业化了，手工业经过社会主义改造，走合作化的道路，将来也用机器生产，前途更是光明！”沙市铁器手工业者赵耀廷在讨论总路线时说：“我父子三代，过去总是借高利贷过活，少的月息二分，多的月息五分，总翻不了身。只有走合作化的道路，才能集中资金，发展生产，才不受高利贷的剥削。”武昌县金口镇的手工业工人和手工业者，认识到加工订货就是初步接受国家的社会主义改造，懂得了要以实际行动贯彻总路线的道理后，保证按期完成国营商业和供销合作社的加工订货任务。该镇原来只想设法维持淡季生活的五家圆木业，学习了总路线，感到现有成品满足不了卖粮农民的大量需要，重新制定了生产计划，决定在二十天内制造粪桶四十六担，锅盖五十六个，水桶五担；曹永兴一家，还计划生产耖十把，犁十五个，耙十一把，水车四乘。为了及时充分满足卖粮农民的需要，新洲城关镇的五户圆木业都增加了工人，买回了大批原料，首先作好一百担粪桶，一百二十把粪瓢，好让农民开展冬季积肥运动。汉川马口镇手工业工人和手工业者学习总路线后，认清了手工业在过渡时期的重要作用和光明前途，随即订立生产计划，铁器业保证作好二千零五十把锄头、二千零二十把镰刀、二百六十把铁锹，使农民卖粮以后，就能买自己需要的农具，准备发展生产。
