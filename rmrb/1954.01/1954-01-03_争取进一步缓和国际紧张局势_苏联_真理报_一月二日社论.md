The broad public in all countries of the world, in summing up 1953, noted with satisfaction that certain achievements had been made in easing international tensions in that year. These achievements are the result of the tenacious and selfless struggle of the people of all countries to defend and consolidate peace and security. The achievements already made have opened up new and broader possibilities for further easing international tensions. These achievements inspire and encourage all who uphold peace.

Entering the new year, the bulwark of world peace, the Soviet Union, continues to fight for the peaceful coexistence of various economic and political systems, and for strengthening practical cooperation with all countries. "It is hoped that international tensions will be further eased this year, and that the cause of striving for a stable and lasting peace throughout the world will achieve great success!" said K.Y. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, in his New Year's greetings. This reflects the deep feelings of every Soviet citizen and is warmly echoed by all good people abroad. All peace-loving people in all countries support the series of measures taken by the Soviet government in the past year to establish international cooperation and consolidate peace.

On the eve of the New Year, Comrade G.M. Malenkov, leader of the Soviet government, once again pointed out the path to consolidating international security when talking about the characteristics of the current international situation. The replies of Comrade G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, to questions raised by Mr. Kingsbury Smith, European Director of the International News Service of the United States, have aroused widespread reaction everywhere. These answers touched on some of the most important questions, and the further relaxation of international tensions in 1954 will depend on the correct solution of these questions.

In his reply to Mr. Kingsbury Smith's questions, Comrade G.M. Malenkov wished the American people a happy New Year, a peaceful life, and success in developing friendly relations with the people of all countries, and complete success in the noble cause of defending peace from conspiracies and sabotage. The entire Soviet people wholeheartedly agree with these wishes of the leader of the Soviet government, because the idea of the Soviet society is the idea of friendship among the people of all countries. The idea of hostility and hatred towards other countries is absolutely intolerable to the Soviet people. It is a poisonous idea that the aggressive groups, who are trying to provoke conflicts among the people of all countries for their own selfish interests, are now using to poison the international atmosphere.

G.M. Malenkov said: "I believe that there are no objective factors preventing the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States in the new year, and preventing the strengthening of the traditional friendship between the people of our two countries. I hope the actual situation will be like this.” All Soviet people agree with this view of our government leader. They firmly believe that the forces advocating peace and friendship among all countries will surely prevail. This confidence is based on the obvious fact that the people of all countries long for lasting peace. The governments of all countries, especially the governments of major countries, cannot fail to listen to the voices of the people, and cannot fail to consider their growing desire for lasting peace. This is the most important feature of the current international situation emphasized by the leader of the Soviet government. The public opinion of the people of all countries has become a major factor in international relations. The voices of the vast social circles cannot be suppressed by anything, and their will cannot be ignored.

As for the Soviet government, it has reaffirmed that its policy has been, is, and will be to maintain and consolidate peace. As G.M. Malenkov pointed out: the Soviet government "has done, is doing, and will do everything in its power to enable the people of all countries to live in peace, to promote the easing of international tensions, and to establish normal international relations." These are the realistic premises that make it possible to maintain world peace and ease international tensions in 1954.

In answering the question "What steps do you think should be taken in 1954 to be the most important for the benefit of world peace?", the leader of the Soviet government pointed out that "Such a step is for all countries to conclude an agreement in which the contracting parties undertake a sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Such an agreement would make it easier to reach an agreement on the complete prohibition of atomic weapons and on the establishment of strict international supervision to ensure that atomic energy is not used for war purposes. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it is also necessary to reach an agreement on substantial reductions in all other types of armaments and armed forces." Comrade G.M. Malenkov pointed out that the implementation of these measures would reduce the military expenditure of various countries and improve the economic conditions of the people.

The reasons given by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union regarding the steps that must be taken in 1954 for the sake of peace will undoubtedly receive the widest support from all good people. All mankind is deeply concerned about eliminating the threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction and substantially reducing the armaments and armed forces of various countries. The reason why these measures have not been implemented so far is only because of the stubborn resistance of the international aggressive groups that are keen on expanding armaments.

The international aggressive groups have made the issue of atomic weapons impossible to resolve; in order to find a way out of this situation, the Soviet government put forward a new proposal in its statement issued on December 21, 1953. If the countries concerned are sincere, this proposal can be implemented without delay. This proposal advocates the conclusion of an agreement prohibiting atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet people unanimously support this proposal of the Soviet government. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union once again emphasized the significance of this proposal in his reply to the questions raised by the European Director of the International News Service of the United States. Comrade G.M. Malenkov's words reflect the thoughts and wishes of every Soviet citizen. The Soviet people are convinced that there are now favorable conditions for further easing international tensions in 1954. The people of all countries who long for lasting peace and strive to achieve complete success in the noble cause of defending peace from conspiracies and sabotage share the same confidence as the Soviet people.

    争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势
    ——苏联“真理报”一月二日社论
    世界各国的广大的公众在总结一九五三年时都满意地指出：这一年，在缓和国际紧张局势方面取得了某些成就。这些成就是各国人民为保卫和巩固和平与安全而进行顽强的、奋不顾身的斗争的结果。已经取得的成就，为进一步缓和国际紧张局势，打开了新的、更加广泛的可能。这些成就激励着一切维护和平的人，鼓舞着他们。
    世界和平的堡垒苏联进入新的一年，继续为各种不同经济、政治制度的和平共处而斗争，为加强与一切国家的事务合作而斗争。苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克·叶·伏罗希洛夫在新年祝词中说：“希望国际紧张局势在今年能进一步缓和，争取全世界稳定的、持久的和平的事业获得巨大的成就！”这反映了每一个苏联人的深切感情，并得到国外的所有善良人们的热烈反应。各国所有爱好和平的人民都支持苏联政府在过去一年中为建立国际合作和巩固和平所采取的一系列措施。
    在新年前夕，苏联政府领袖格·马·马林科夫同志在谈到当前国际形势的特点时又一次指出了巩固国际安全的道路。苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫同志对美国国际新闻社欧洲分社社长金斯伯里·史密斯先生所提问题的答复在各地引起广泛的反应。在这些答复中涉及到一些最重要的问题，要在一九五四年内求得国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，就有赖于这些问题的正确解决。
    格·马·马林科夫同志在对金斯伯里·史密斯先生所提问题的答复中，祝美国人民新年幸福，祝他们得过和平的生活，祝他们在发展和各国人民的友好关系方面获得成功，在保卫和平免遭阴谋破坏的崇高事业中获得圆满成就。苏联全体人民全心同意苏联政府领袖这些祝词，因为苏维埃社会的思想就是各国人民友好的思想。对别国人民敌视和仇视的思想是苏联人绝对不容的，这是一种有毒的思想，那些为了自私的利益而企图挑起各国人民互相冲突的侵略集团现在正用这种思想毒害国际气氛。
    格·马·马林科夫说：“我认为，没有客观的因素阻碍苏联和美国之间的关系在新的一年内得到改善，阻碍我们两国人民之间传统的友好关系得到加强。我希望实际情况将是这样。”所有苏联人都同意我们政府领袖的这种意见。他们深信主张和平与各国人民友谊的力量定将获得胜利。他们这种信心基于一个明显的事实，即各国人民都渴望持久和平。各国政府，首先是各大国的政府，不能不倾听人民的呼声，不能不考虑他们对持久和平的日益增长的愿望。苏联政府领袖所强调指出的当前国际形势的最重要特点就在这里。各国人民的舆论成了国际关系的重大因素。广大社会各界的声音是任何东西也压制不了的，他们的意志是不容忽视的。
    至于苏联政府，它再度申明，它的政策过去是、现在是、将来还是维护和平与巩固和平的政策。如格·马·马林科夫所指出的：苏联政府“过去、现在和将来都竭尽一切力量，以使各国人民和平相处，促使国际紧张局势缓和，并建立正常的国际关系。”现实的前提就是这样，这些前提使得有可能在一九五四年维护世界和平与缓和国际紧张局势。
    苏联政府领袖在答复“您以为，在一九五四年内应该采取怎样的步骤才是有利于世界和平的最重要的步骤？”这一问题时指出“这样的步骤是，各国缔结一个协定，各缔约国在这一协定中承担神圣和无条件的义务，不使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器。这样一个协定，将会使关于完全禁止原子武器、关于为保证禁止把原子能用于战争目的而建立严格的国际监督的问题，易于达成协议。和这同时，苏联政府认为，就大量裁减其他一切类型的军备和武装部队的问题达成协议，也是必要的。”格·马·马林科夫同志指出，实现这些措施将会减少各国的军费开支，使人民的经济境况有所改善。
    苏联部长会议主席所说的关于在一九五四年为了和平的利益而必须采取的步骤的理由，无可争辩地将受到所有善良的人们最广泛的支持。全体人类切身关心的是：消除使用大规模杀人武器的威胁，大量裁减各国的军备和武装部队。这些措施之所以到现在没有实现，只是因为热中于扩张军备的国际侵略集团顽抗。
    国际侵略集团使原子武器问题陷入无法解决的境地；为了找出摆脱这种境地的出路，苏联政府在一九五三年十二月二十一日发表的声明中提出了新的建议，如果有关国家具有诚意，这个建议是可以毫不拖延地予以实现的。这个建议主张缔结禁用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的协定。苏联人民一致支持苏联政府的这个建议，苏联部长会议主席在对美国国际新闻社欧洲分社社长所提问题的答复中，再次着重说到这个建议的意义。格·马·马林科夫同志的话反映了每一个苏联人的想法和愿望。苏联人确信，现在有着有利的条件在一九五四年进一步缓和国际紧张局势。各国人民，凡是渴望持久和平和努力在保卫和平免遭阴谋破坏的崇高事业中取得圆满成果的，都与苏联人民具有同样信心。　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯）
