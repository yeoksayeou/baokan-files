    Severely Punish the奸商 (Traitorous Merchants) Who Stole and Sold the Longmen Stone Buddhas
    --Summary of Readers' Letters
    After this newspaper published a letter from sculptor Liu Kaiqu and nine others exposing the crimes of奸商 (traitorous merchants) Yue Bin and others who stole and sold the Longmen Stone Buddhas, a large number of readers wrote to express their indignation and demanded that the government severely punish them.
    The Luoyang County People's Government wrote: "Before liberation, Beijing antique dealer Yue Bin and others colluded with local tyrant Han Xuande and others in our county to steal and sell the 'Empress Worshipping Buddha' stone carvings, two large murals from the Binyang Cave, three large standing statues, and Buddhist statues from the Longmen Grottoes. The broad masses of people in our county are extremely resentful of this crime. Our country's precious cultural heritage has been visibly destroyed by this antique dealer. We demand that this conscienceless antique dealer be severely punished according to law." Readers Hong Binyuan and four others wrote: "Our motherland is a country with a long history of five thousand years. For thousands of years, countless working people have created countless exquisite and magnificent cultural and artistic works with their labor and wisdom. These heritages make us feel the greatness and loveability of our motherland even more. However,奸商 (traitorous merchants) Yue Bin and others colluded with imperialists to steal our country's precious and rare ancient cultural relics in a planned and large-scale manner, which is intolerable to every Chinese person." All the students of the Sculpture Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts wrote: "We feel incomparable indignation at the crimes of奸商 (traitorous merchants) Yue Bin and others who stole and sold the Longmen Stone Buddhas. This despicable behavior of destroying the artistic masterpieces of the motherland is absolutely intolerable. We demand that the People's Government give the奸商 (traitorous merchants) Yue Bin and others severe legal sanctions." Cai Wengui and Yang Xizhang, majoring in archeology at Peking University, wrote: "We are future archeologists. Under the reactionary rule of the past, many of our country's cultural relics were wantonly destroyed and stolen by imperialists and奸商 (traitorous merchants). When we heard our teachers talk about such events in the past, we felt infinite indignation. After liberation, the People's Government attached great importance to cultural relics, promulgated a series of laws and regulations to protect cultural relics, and systematically trained a large number of archeology professionals. These facts have educated us to love our motherland more and cherish the ancient cultural relics of our motherland. However, antique dealer Yue Bin and others, in order to pursue personal profits, did not hesitate to violate national interests. This crime should be subject to the people's legal sanctions." Shu Jinrong of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army wrote: "Imperialists have always coveted our country's cultural treasures and have carried out barbarous theft and plunder of our country's cultural heritage. The accomplice crime of奸商 (traitorous merchants) Yue Bin and others colluding with imperialists to steal the Longmen Stone Buddhas is especially infuriating." Li Zengfu, a Hui compatriot who is sick, wrote: "Although I am recuperating from illness, I must also write a letter to express my opinion. We should cherish and love the artistic crystallization created by our ancestors with their blood and sweat. This is the responsibility and obligation of every citizen. However, the inhuman antique dealer Yue Bin and others stole the 'Empress Worshipping Buddha' and sold it to imperialism. This behavior is, as Comrade Liu Kaiqu and others said, 'no different from the enemy of the people' and is absolutely intolerable."
    In addition, readers are also extremely indignant at the criminal acts of奸商 (traitorous merchants) Ni Yushu and others who destroyed and stole the Tiān Lóng Shān (天龙山) stone carvings, and demanded that the People's Government punish them according to law.
    The readers' opinions are correct. The Beijing People's Court should accept the just demands of the masses and deal with the crimes of Yue Bin, Ni Yushu and others according to law.

    严惩盗卖龙门石佛的奸商
    ——读者来信综述
    本报发表了雕刻工作者刘开渠等十人来信揭发奸商岳彬等盗卖龙门石佛的罪行后，广大读者纷纷来信，一致表示愤恨，要求政府予以严惩。
    洛阳县人民政府来信说：“北京古玩奸商岳彬等解放前曾勾结我县恶霸韩宣德等，盗卖龙门的精华宾阳洞‘王后礼佛图’石刻二大幅并大立幅三尊及龙门石窟中佛像。对于这种罪行，我县广大人民极为痛恨。我国珍贵的文化遗产，被这个古玩奸商已破坏得目不忍睹。我们要求对这丧尽天良的古玩奸商依法严加惩处。”读者洪斌元等五人来信说：“我们祖国是一个具有五千年悠久历史的国家，数千年来无数劳动人民以自己的劳动和智慧，创造了无数精美壮丽的文化艺术作品，这些遗产使我们更感到祖国的伟大可爱。但奸商岳彬等却勾结帝国主义有计划地、大规模地盗窃我国珍贵稀世的古代文物，这是每一个中国人民所不能容忍的。”中央美术学院雕塑系全体同学来信说：“我们对于奸商岳彬等盗卖龙门石佛的罪行，感到无比的愤恨。这种破坏祖国的艺术杰作的卑劣行为，是决不能容忍的。我们要求人民政府给奸商岳彬等以严厉的法律制裁。”北京大学考古专业蔡文轨、杨锡璋来信说：“我们是未来的考古工作者。在过去反动统治下，我国很多文物为帝国主义者及奸商肆意破坏、盗窃。当我们上课时听到教师们讲到过去这类事件时，就感到无限的愤慨。解放后，人民政府十分重视文物，颁布了一系列保护文物的法令，并有计划地培养了大批考古专业人材。这些事实教育了我们更热爱祖国和珍视祖国的古代文物。而古玩奸商岳彬等为了追逐个人利润，不惜违背民族利益，这一罪行应受到人民的法律制裁。”解放军某部舒锦荣来信说：“帝国主义者对我国的文化宝藏一直是垂涎欲滴，对我国的文化遗产曾进行了野蛮的盗窃和掠夺。奸商岳彬等勾结帝国主义者盗窃龙门石佛的帮凶罪行尤其令人愤恨。”正在病中的回族同胞李增福来信说：“我虽在病中休养，但也要提笔写信表达我的意见。我们的祖先以血汗劳动创造的艺术结晶，我们每个人都应该珍惜爱护它，这是每个人民的责任和义务。但毫无人性的古玩奸商岳彬等却盗窃‘王后礼佛图’等卖给帝国主义，这种行为正如刘开渠等同志所说‘无异人民公敌’，是绝不能令人容忍的。”
    此外，读者们对奸商倪玉书等破坏和盗卖天龙山石刻的罪恶行为也极为痛恨，要求人民政府依法加以惩处。
    读者的意见是正确的。北京市人民法院应该接受群众的正义要求，对岳彬、倪玉书等的罪行依法进行处理。
