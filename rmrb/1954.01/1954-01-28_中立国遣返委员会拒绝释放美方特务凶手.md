　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 27th: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) today rejected the American side's request to release seventeen Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents who murdered seven pro-repatriation Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. In a letter from NNRC Chairman General Thimayya to the American side, which was approved by a majority of the NNRC members, it was stated that releasing these murderers "is tantamount to a complete denial of justice."
　　In a letter to General Thimayya on January 20, the American side threatened that it "must strenuously insist" that the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces release the murderers no later than January 22. Since January 23, the American side has refused to send their "witnesses" and "defense lawyers" to court, thereby forcing the Indian Custodial Forces to suspend the interrogation of four of the murderers.
　　In a press release issued today, the NNRC published General Thimayya's reply to the American side, stating: "The NNRC cannot release any prisoner of war who has committed acts of murder for which there appears to be conclusive evidence. Such a release is tantamount to a complete denial of justice. The NNRC cannot help to establish such a precedent with serious consequences." General Thimayya requested the American side to send its "witnesses" and "defense lawyers" to court in order to continue the interrogation of the murderers.

　　中立国遣返委员会拒绝释放美方特务凶手
    【新华社开城二十七日电】　中立国遣返委员会今天拒绝了美方所提出的释放谋杀七名希望遣返的朝中战俘的十七个国民党和李承晚特务的要求。中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军在中立国遣返委员会多数委员通过的给美方的信件中说：这种释放凶手的做法“等于完全否定正义”。
    美方在一月二十日致蒂迈雅将军的信中威胁说，它“必须竭力坚持”中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队最迟在一月二十二日释放凶手。自从一月二十三日以来，美方一直拒绝派遣他们的“证人”和“辩护律师”出庭，从而迫使印度看管部队对四名凶手的审讯陷于中断。
    中立国遣返委员会在今天的公报中发表的蒂迈雅将军给美方的复信说：“中立国遣返委员会不能释放犯有看来证据确凿的谋杀行为的任何战俘。这样的释放等于完全否定正义。中立国遣返委员会不能帮助创立这样一种有着严重后果的先例。”蒂迈雅将军要求美方派遣它的“证人”和“辩护律师”出庭，以便继续对凶手进行审讯。
