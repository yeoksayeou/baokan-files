Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Fengnan County People's Supervisory Committee
    Has Shortcomings in Handling People's Letters
    Tangshan Peasant News Jin Mingqiao writes: On May 5, 1953, Tangshan Peasant News forwarded to the Fengnan County People's Supervisory Committee a reader's letter (numbered 285) reflecting the illegal and undisciplined behavior of village cadres in Xiaozhanggezhuang Village, Seventh District, Fengnan County, requesting them to handle and reply. After the Peasant News sent a letter urging them to do so, the Fengnan County People's Supervisory Committee wrote to the newspaper on August 18, saying: "We will promptly investigate and understand the transferred letter No. 285." After two months, there was still no reply. The newspaper sent two more letters urging them to inquire, and on October 20, it received a reply saying: "In any case, we must handle the letters transferred from the newspaper in advance." However, their reply on November 10 was surprisingly: "We have indeed not received the No. 285 letter transferred by the newspaper, so we cannot handle the reply." This contradictory reply shows that the Fengnan County People's Supervisory Committee is not responsible enough in handling letters from the people. It is hoped that they will check and correct this.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    丰南县人民监察委员会
    处理人民来信工作有缺点
    唐山农民报金明桥来信：一九五三年五月五日，唐山农民报转给丰南县人民监察委员会一封反映丰南县七区小张各庄村干部违法乱纪的读者来信
  （编号是二八五号），请他们处理答复。经农民报去信催办后，八月十八日丰南县人民监察委员会写信给该报说：“二八五号转办信我们要及时调查了解。”过了两个月仍不见答复，该报又两次去信催问，十月二十日接到答复说：“无论如何，我们对报社转来的信一定要提前处理。”可是，他们十一月十日的答复出人意外地说：“报社转办的二八五号信，我们确实没有收到，因此无法处理答复。”这种先后矛盾的答复，说明了丰南县人民监察委员会处理人民群众来信的工作是不够负责的，希望他们检查纠正。
