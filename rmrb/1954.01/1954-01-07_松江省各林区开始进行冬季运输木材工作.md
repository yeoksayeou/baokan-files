The various forest areas of Songjiang Province have now fully begun winter timber transport work.

In order to ensure the timely transport of timber down the mountains, the Songjiang Provincial People's Government mobilized more than 64,800 people and 61,000 head of cattle and horses in twenty-six counties to participate in the winter timber transport work in nineteen forest industry bureaus. When mobilizing labor, the forest industry bureaus and local people's governments generally used the original mutual aid teams (cooperatives) as units, and appropriately took into account the principle of mobilizing on the spot, in order to reduce the travel distance for vehicles and horses. Before entering the mountains, a meeting of representatives of the households was also held to resolve specific issues related to entering the mountains. By mid-December of last year, all collection teams and most transport teams had successively entered the mountains to begin operations.

Since the beginning of winter, there has not been much snowfall, which has caused many difficulties for horse teams to transport timber in winter. For example, after the horse teams of the Wuminhe Forest Industry Bureau went up the mountain, the accumulated snow gradually melted, and the ground was dry, resulting in very low transport efficiency. As a result, some cadres and the masses developed the idea of waiting for snow. The Wuminhe Forest Industry Bureau promptly convened a meeting, put forward the method of watering and laying ice, and called on everyone to resolutely complete the timber transport task. After the meeting, cadres and the masses of the "Forward," "Red Flag," and "Safety" workshops were all mobilized to water and lay ice day and night. After seven days and nights of effort, a total of more than 38 li of ice road was laid. After the ice road was laid, the production efficiency was greatly improved. For example, the "Forward" workshop only pulled more than 60 cubic meters of timber the day before laying ice, but quickly reached 200 cubic meters after laying ice. The staff and workers of other workshops in the Cuiluan, Weihe, Nancha and other forest industry bureaus also laid ice roads, and comprehensively began transporting timber. At present, most of them have reached or exceeded the timber transport quota standards, and everyone is confident of completing the national timber transport task ahead of schedule. (Liu Yingqiao)

### 松江省各林区开始进行冬季运输木材工作

    松江省各林区开始进行冬季运输木材工作
    松江省各林区现已全面开始冬季运输木材工作。
    为了保证把木材及时运搬下山，松江省人民政府在二十六个县中动员六万四千八百多个人力和六万一千头牛、马，分别到十九个森林工业局参加木材冬运工作。各森林工业局和当地人民政府在动员劳力时，一般都以原互助组（社）为单位，并适当照顾就地动员的原则，以减少车马运输旅程。入山前并召开了套户代表会议，解决了有关入山的具体问题。到去年十二月中旬为止，全部集材套子和大部运材套子都已先后入山开始作业。
    入冬以来，降雪不多，给马套子冬季运材造成许多困难。如乌敏河森林工业局的马套子上山后，积雪渐渐化尽，地面干燥，运输效率很低。因此，有些干部和群众产生了等待下雪的思想。乌敏河森林工业局及时召开会议，提出浇水铺冰办法，号召大家坚决完成运材任务。会后，“前进”、“红旗”、“安全”三个车间的干部、群众全部动员起来，日夜浇水铺冰。经过七昼夜的努力，共浇成冰道三十八里多。冰道浇成后，生产效率大大提高。如“前进”车间铺冰前一天只拉六十多立方公尺木材，铺冰后很快就达到二百立方公尺。其他翠峦、苇河、南叉等森林工业局各车间职工和群众也都浇成了冰道，全面开始运材。目前，大部分都达到或超过运材定额标准，大家有信心提前完成国家运材任务。（刘英翘）
