Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 20th: On the day commemorating the 30th anniversary of V.I. Lenin's death, snowflakes were flying in Moscow. The snow covered the entire Red Square, and snowflakes fell lightly on the facets of the towers, adorning the crenellated walls of the Kremlin, the silver and blue spruces, and the top of the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum as if they were made of powder and jade. At the entrance to the Mausoleum stood the honor guard. Beside the main gates of the Mausoleum, there were many wreaths presented by delegations from Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Italy who had recently visited the Soviet Union.

Tens of thousands of working people braved the wind, snow, and severe cold to visit the Mausoleum. The endless stream of people moved slowly. These were ordinary Soviet laborers, some workers building the beautiful architectural projects of our century, some laborers striving for a bumper harvest and producing more consumer goods, and some Soviet soldiers vigilantly defending our motherland. People held their breath and solemnly passed through the Mausoleum, excitedly looking up at the benevolent faces of V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin. Everyone wanted to leave an eternal memory of these two great leaders in their minds. People's love for these two great leaders will never be extinguished.

Since the opening of the Mausoleum, more than 33 million people have come here to visit it. Since January of this year, 150,000 Soviet urban and rural laborers and foreign guests have come here to pay their respects.

    苏联人民拜谒列宁斯大林陵墓
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：在纪念乌·伊·列宁逝世三十周年的日子里，莫斯科飞舞着雪花。白雪盖满了整个红场，雪花飘飘地落在棱形的塔顶上，把克里姆林宫的齿状围墙、银枞、青枞和列宁斯大林陵墓的顶部，装镶得俨如粉妆玉砌的一样。陵墓入口处，站着守陵的仪仗队。在陵墓各大门的旁边，摆着最近访问苏联的捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、意大利的代表团敬献的许多花圈。
    成千成万的劳动人民冒着风雪严寒来拜谒陵墓。无穷无尽的人流慢慢移动着。这些人都是苏联的普通劳动者，有的是建设我们世纪的美丽的建筑工程的工人，有的是正在争取丰收、争取生产更多的消费品的劳动者，有的是正在警惕地捍卫着我们祖国的苏军战士。人们屏着呼吸，庄严肃穆地通过陵墓，激动地瞻仰乌·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林的慈祥的遗容，每个人都想使这两位伟大领袖的形象在自己的心目中留下一个永远的记忆。人们对这两位伟大的领袖的热爱是永不熄灭的。
    自从陵墓开放以来，已有三千三百多万人到这里来拜谒陵墓。从今年一月以来，到这里来瞻仰陵墓的已有十五万苏联城乡劳动者和外宾。
