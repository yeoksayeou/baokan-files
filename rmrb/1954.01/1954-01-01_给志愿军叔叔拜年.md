Greetings to the Volunteer Army Uncles

\tBeijing Third Women's High School All Young Pioneers

\tDear Volunteer Army Uncles:

\tThe New Year is here. We naturally think of you. Let our seven hundred and one children wearing red scarves, in the heart of the motherland—Beijing, wish you a Happy New Year! We wish you victory in defending your positions, and success in helping the Korean people in their reconstruction.

\tDear Volunteer Army Uncles, do you remember? In the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, there was a little girl with two braids, whom you all called "Little Cui" or "Red Scarf." She was Cui Jinrong, an excellent student from our school. She represented us, no, she represented the children of the motherland, to visit you. On the evening of December 18th, Comrade Cui Jinrong returned to the school. We were in self-study at the time, but who could suppress their excitement? Everyone poured out of the classrooms, vying to shake her hand and hug her, how tightly and enthusiastically they shook and hugged! Because she had just come from among you uncles! When Zhang Shuyun from Junior Middle Two Class Five hugged Cui Jinrong, her eyes were filled with tears. These were truly tears of joy, tears of excitement! Uncles, you don't know, when Cui Jinrong was leaving us, Zhang Shuyun made a firm promise: Please take my precious gift to the Volunteer Army Uncles, and tell them that when you return from Korea, I will definitely strive to become a Youth League member to see you! Uncles, even before Cui Jinrong returned, she had fulfilled her promise and was approved by the branch to join the Youth League on December 4th. Now, when she saw Cui Jinrong, how could she not be so excited that she shed tears!

\tUncles, dear Volunteer Army Uncles, over the past few years, your every victory, every letter, has been such a great encouragement to us! In Junior Middle Two Class Four, there is a classmate named Li Xuemin, who is only thirteen years old. When she was in the first year of junior high school, she saw that many classmates had a Volunteer Army friend and was very envious, but she didn't have one and was very anxious. So she carefully wrote a letter, writing only "Volunteer Army Uncle Receive" on the envelope and sent it out. From then on, she waited every day for your reply. It wasn't until last winter vacation that she received her first letter from the Korean front, written to her by uncles Yang Gengsheng, Li Binggui, and Huang Chuanjia. How happy she was. This summer vacation, she challenged these uncles again to strive to be an excellent student. Now, her challenge condition has been achieved. In the first phase of exams this semester, her average grade was 97.1.

\tIn Wu Heng's diary in Junior Middle Three Class Two, uncles' letters are densely copied, and there are five or six photos of uncles, one of whom has a red scarf neatly around his neck, standing there heroically. He is Uncle Song Shunning, who was wounded five times and awarded two merits. That red scarf is the one that Wu Heng wore two years ago. Even now, whenever we see the red scarf in this photo, we gain strength.

\tThe story is this: Last January, Uncle Pang Dianchen from the delegation you sent back came to have a get-together with us, and Wu Heng gave him her beloved red scarf. When Uncle Pang Dianchen returned to Korea to give a report, he gave the red scarf to First-Class Hero He Xianli. However, Wu Heng only learned of this news in February of this year, and she immediately wrote a letter to Uncle He Xianli. The letter was sent, one day, two days..., Wu Heng was waiting, waiting for Uncle He Xianli's reply. Finally, on March 8th of this year, a letter arrived from Korea, which read:

\t"Little Sister Wu Heng, February 13th was the Lunar New Year's Eve. All the soldiers in the battalion were gathering their strength to use victory on this meaningful day to respond to the love of the people of the motherland for us. Before the departure, Comrade He Xianli, as usual, took out your red scarf to look at it, and the comrades also vowed: to obtain the greatest glory in battle, and strive to wear the red scarf you sent like He Xianli.

\t"The battle was going on fiercely. Soon, we opened up eleven enemy tunnels, annihilated two platoons of enemy troops, and captured a lot of weapons and ammunition. ... The crazy enemy was indiscriminately bombing our positions. He Xianli was the deputy platoon leader, and he was afraid that the soldiers would not be well concealed, so he went out of the tunnel to check. A bomb exploded three meters away from him, and he, our hero Comrade He Xianli, bid farewell to us forever.

\t"Little sister, when I took your red scarf from his body, the red scarf was still placed with his medals, wrapped in several layers of parachute silk and oil paper, but it had already been stained with the blood of a hero..."

\tThe letter was signed by Shi Rengping, and Uncle Shi Rengping also sought Wu Heng's opinion in the letter, whether to transfer the red scarf to another hero uncle so that it could continue to play an encouraging role. How could she not be willing? In this way, the red scarf was transferred to Uncle Song Shunning on June 1st this year. Uncle Song Shunning and Uncle He Xianli were in the same company. They had fought together, shed blood together, and made meritorious deeds together.

\tDear Volunteer Army Uncles, Uncle He Xianli has sacrificed, but his spirit will always exist in our hearts. Wu Heng's class held a discussion for this and decided to learn from the spirit of Uncle He Xianli and attack the fortress of science. In the first phase of exams last semester, the average score of their class reached ninety-three points, Wu Heng herself also received a medal of excellence, and even her physical education, which she didn't pay much attention to in the past, scored eighty-five points this semester. As for all of us, uncles, we will never fail your hopes. Most of us have made our own ambitions. When we grow up, we will join the air force, the navy, and be engineers, tractor drivers, teachers... Recently, the teacher told us about the general line of our country during the transition period, and everyone felt that they were closer to realizing their ideals. We must work hard to learn skills, and according to the instructions of the uncles, when we grow up, we will protect and build our country well!

### 给志愿军叔叔拜年

    给志愿军叔叔拜年
    北京市第三女子中学全体少年先锋队员
    亲爱的志愿军叔叔：
    新年到了。我们很自然地想起了你们。让我们七百零一个带着红领巾的孩子，在祖国的心脏—北京，给你们拜拜年吧！祝你们守卫阵地的胜利，祝你们帮助朝鲜人民建设的成功。
    亲爱的志愿军叔叔，你们还记得吗？在中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团里，有一个梳着两条小辫的小姑娘，你们都管她叫“小崔”或者是“红领巾”，她就是我们学校里的优秀学生崔晋荣。她是代表着我们，不，代表着祖国的孩子们，去看你们的。十二月十八日的晚上，崔晋荣同学回到学校里来了，当时我们正在上自习，可是谁能压住自己兴奋的心情呢。大家都从教室里涌了出来，抢着和她握手，和她拥抱，握得抱得多紧，多热烈啊！因为她是刚刚从叔叔们中间来的呀！初二五班的张淑云和崔晋荣拥抱的时候，眼里沾满了泪花，这真正是快乐的泪，兴奋的泪呀！叔叔，你们是不知道的，在崔晋荣和我们离别的时候，张淑云曾提出了坚决的保证：请把我的珍贵礼品带给志愿军叔叔，就说在你赴朝慰问回来的时候，我一定争取当个青年团员来见你！叔叔，没有等崔晋荣回来，她就实现了自己的诺言，在十二月四日被支部通过加入青年团了。现在，当她看到了崔晋荣，怎么能不兴奋得流泪呢！
    叔叔，亲爱的志愿军叔叔，几年来，你们的每一次胜利，每一封来信，对我们的鼓舞真是大啊！初二四班有一个同学叫李学敏，才十三岁，还是在初中一年级的时候，她看见很多同学都有个志愿军朋友，很羡慕，可是自己没有，又很着急。她就用心地写了一封信，信封上只写了“志愿军叔叔收”就寄出去了。从那时候起，她每天都在等着你们的回信。直到去年寒假，她才收到了第一封从朝鲜前线寄来的信，那是你们那里的杨更生、李炳贵、黄传家叔叔写给她的。她是多么高兴呀。今年暑假，她又给这几个叔叔提出了挑战，争取当优等生。现在，她的挑战条件已经实现了。这一学期第一阶段考试中，她的功课平均成绩是九十七点一分。
    在初三二班吴蘅的一本日记本上，密密麻麻地抄写着叔叔们的来信，还贴着五六张叔叔们的照片，其中有一个叔叔的脖子里，端端正正地带着一条红领巾，雄赳赳地站在那里。他就是五次受伤、两次立功的宋顺鼎叔叔，那条红领巾就是两年以前吴蘅同学带过的。直到现在，我们一看到这张像片上的红领巾，就增加了力量。
    事情是这样的：去年一月间，你们派回来的代表团中的庞殿臣叔叔来和我们联欢，吴蘅就把自己心爱的红领巾赠给了他。庞殿臣叔叔回到朝鲜做报告时，又把红领巾转赠给了一等功臣何显礼叔叔。可是，今年二月吴蘅才知道了这个消息，她马上就给何显礼叔叔写了信。信发出去了，一天，两天……，吴蘅在盼望着，在盼望着何显礼叔叔的回信。终于，今年三月八日收到了一封从朝鲜寄来的信，信上写道：
    “吴蘅小妹妹，二月十三日，是春节除夕的夜晚。全营的战士们都攒足了劲，要在这个有意义的日子里，拿胜利来回答祖国人民对我们的热爱。出发前，何显礼同志照例地把你那条红领巾拿出来看了看，同志们也都宣誓：要在战斗中获取最大的光荣，争取像何显礼一样，带上你们送来的红领巾。
      “战斗激烈地进行着。很快，我们就打开了敌人十一条坑道，全歼敌人两个排的兵力，还获得了很多武器和弹药。……疯狂的敌人对我们阵地进行滥炸了。何显礼是副排长，他唯恐战士们隐蔽不好，便走出坑道来检查。一颗炸弹在距他三公尺的地方爆炸了，他，我们英雄的何显礼同志，就这样和我们永别了。
      “小妹妹，当我从他的身上拿出你那条红领巾的时候，红领巾还是和他的奖章放在一起，用降落伞的绸子和油纸包了好几层，可是，它，已经染上了英雄的鲜血……。”
    信末的署名是史仍平，史仍平叔叔还在信中征求吴蘅的意见，要把这条红领巾再转送给另外一个英雄叔叔，让它继续发挥鼓舞作用。她怎么能不愿意呢？就这样，这条红领巾又在今年六月一日转赠给宋顺鼎叔叔了。宋顺鼎叔叔和何显礼叔叔同在一个连队里，他们是一块打过仗，流过血，立过功的。
    亲爱的志愿军叔叔，何显礼叔叔牺牲了，可是他的精神却永远存在我们的心里呀。吴蘅同学的班上为这开了讨论会，决心学习何显礼叔叔的精神，向科学堡垒进攻。上学期的第一阶段的考试中，她们全班的平均分数就达到了九十三分，吴蘅自己也带上了优良奖章，就连她过去最不注意的体育，这学期也考了八十五分。至于我们大家呢，叔叔啊，也绝不会辜负你们的希望。我们多数人都立下了自己的志愿，长大了要参加空军，海军，要做工程师、拖拉机手、教师……最近，老师又给我们讲了咱们国家过渡时期的总路线，大家都觉得离实现自己的理想更近了。我们要努力学习本领，照着叔叔们的嘱托，长大了，好好保卫和建设咱们的国家！
              （少年先锋队员郑必昭执笔）
                                十二月三十日（附图片）
    这就是志愿军战士宋顺鼎。他带的红领巾，就是吴蘅同学赠给的。
