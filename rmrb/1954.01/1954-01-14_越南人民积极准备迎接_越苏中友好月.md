    越南各报刊也在一九五四年元旦开始陆续刊载有关的材料和文章。越南文学艺术工作者协会出版了许多苏联和中国的文艺作品的译本，如苏联的“马雅柯夫斯基诗选”、波列沃伊的短篇小说“我们是苏维埃人”的选译本和中国剧本“白毛女”的节译本，刘白羽的小说“火光在前”、魏巍的“战士和祖国”等书；此外，越南文艺工作者还专门创作了许多歌曲和美术作品。
    从一月十八日越苏中友好月开始的一个月中，越南各地都将分别举行庆祝会，各地并以部门或地区为单位出版墙报、放映苏联、中国、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国的影片，举办介绍苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的图片和书报展览会，举行文艺表演和放映幻灯等；各个学校还增加讲授有关苏联、中国和越苏中友谊的史料；“越南之声”电台将逐日播送有关越苏中友好的特别节目；政府邮电部门将发行纪念邮票；各人民团体的负责人和许多战斗英雄、劳动模范都准备广泛地写信给苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的人民，表达深厚的友谊。在这个期间，越南劳动人民还要展开为期一月的加强越苏中友谊的爱国劳动竞赛运动。
