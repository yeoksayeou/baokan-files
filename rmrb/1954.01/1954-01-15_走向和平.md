    Towards Peace
    Soviet Union　Ehrenburg
    Ten years ago, people greeted the New Year in shelters, air-raid shelters, trenches, in the dim and cold houses of cities under blackout conditions, on unsafe war roads, beside guerrilla bonfires, in prisoner-of-war camps, and amidst ruins and ashes. Life was difficult then, but people of all countries were still very happy to welcome 1944: they knew that the most difficult days had passed, and the scales had shifted—the world had taken a step towards peace. The victory at Stalingrad, which defeated the dark forces oppressing the people of all countries, inspired people. Soviet troops crossed the Dnieper River and advanced westward. Fighting was going on in Italy. Resistance in various European countries increased: the forests of Poland and Slovakia, the mountains of Sava, and the oak forests of Limoges all witnessed heroic guerrillas. Hitler's "New Europe," this illusory empire built on brutality, lies, and enslavement, began to shake; everyone already saw that the moment of human victory was not far away.
    These memories inevitably come to mind when thinking about the New Year's wishes of the whole world for the new year of 1954. After a long period of hardship, terror, and sacrifice, the people of all countries are welcoming this New Year with a hope that no one can call frivolous. The people of all countries, who have experienced so many sufferings, are no longer naive teenagers. They know that the consolidation of peace forces must be paid for with perseverance, hard work, boldness, fearlessness, and great willpower. Just like ten years ago, the scales have shifted—peace will triumph.
    The cessation of military operations in Korea not only liberated this brave country from unprecedented and undeserved terror, but also marked the first great victory of reason. It gave hope to the people of the world and inspired them. An American commentator wrote that the result of the three-year war was a draw. Regardless of the arguments of these strategists, we will only say one thing: the horrific war in Korea caused violence to fail in spirit, principle, and policy. The Korean armistice showed the people of all countries that if the raging war could be extinguished, then those reckless or despicable people who dared to provoke war could be stopped in time.
    How much has changed in the past year! The forces of peace have been strengthened to the point that few people directly clamor for war. These cries were the favorite mantra of many politicians across the ocean a year ago. Not only have the vicious war reports about the use of gasoline bombs disappeared from the newspaper pages, but even the unscrupulous suggestions about where to drop atomic bombs have disappeared. These suggestions were often put forward between the Senate sessions and the cocktail parties. Now we can hear the advocates of gasoline bombs praising the idea of consultation, and the lovers of atomic bombs swearing that they are very fond of peace. Of course, we are not saying that conscience has awakened, and even the most gullible people will not regard a disguised person as a regenerated person. However, if some politicians have changed their vocabulary, it is because the thoughts and feelings of millions of people have changed, and because the balance of power has changed. What is important is not what these disguised people say, but why they are beginning to speak in a new way.
    I lived in the Netherlands for a few weeks, near the dikes that protect the country from sea encroachment. I will not forget how those people who were awakened in the middle of the night worked silently and patiently and conquered the forces of nature. I have seen farmers in the Landes region of France put out forest fires, and gardeners in the cold nights of northern China light bonfires and use smoke to protect fragile trees from frost. I have seen how collective farm members, mainly women, built their burnt villages in the first year after the war; in Warsaw, construction workers rebuilt their lovely city from the ashes under the light of night searchlights. People have also worked in this way in the movement to defend peace: sparing no effort, and in some countries even sparing no lives, going from house to house, street to street, city to city, touching every heart, appealing to the reason of anyone, and appealing to the conscience of the people of all countries.
    Was it long ago that Western newspapers contemptuously concealed the appeals of peace defenders? Was it long ago that those who insisted on peaceful negotiations were declared insane or criminal in many countries? The movement to defend peace has not been in existence for five years, and in this short period it has achieved such success that now the words of those who participate in the movement to defend peace are firmly and unwaveringly repeated by all their compatriots in any city and at any crossroads.
    The World Peace Council has pointed out more than once that the forces of revenge and aggression must not be allowed to recover; the World Peace Council firmly maintains that the establishment of a unified Germany can bring peace, and if Germany does not participate in any military alliance, it will not be a threat to its neighboring countries. Now not only the majority of French people agree with this view, but also the majority of people in the parliament that the war forces not long ago considered to be the best for them. Among those who oppose the "European Army," we see representatives of various groups: Radical Socialists Herriot and Daladier, followers of General de Gaulle, Socialists, and Catholics; these people, together with peace defenders, oppose the restoration of any form of Wehrmacht, oppose trampling on France's national sovereignty, and despise its national security.
    At the other end of the world, we see that the condemnation of the establishment of military bases in other countries' territories and the condemnation of aggressive pacts by peace defenders has now been supported by the leader of one of the largest countries in the world. We know that what supports the words of World Peace Council members Kitchlew and Sok is not simply so many committees or so many signatures, but the whole of India.
    Is it not enough to characterize everything that the foreign minister of a country in Scandinavia recently declared that the resolutions of the World Peace Council are the mouthpiece of world opinion? Could he have said this a few years ago? Could the former Belgian foreign minister have admitted the full importance of the debates in the World Peace Council when answering Isabelle Blume in parliament? Could we have seen the Chilean House of Representatives approve its speaker to attend the meeting of the World Peace Council a year ago? Could the most famous religious and social figures in the Middle East and Near East at that time have openly linked the aspirations of their nations with the victory of the idea of defending peace?
    Yes, there have been many changes in the world, and the movement to defend peace has played a great role in these changes. Hope has been revived in the hearts of millions of people: hope to end the cold war that everyone hates, hope to live a lighter, more comfortable, and more worthy life. The Soviet Union's peace proposals have been praised by various social groups in various countries, so that even those who oppose consultation have to disguise themselves, adapt to the situation, and pretend to be benevolent.
    It should be believed that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will be prepared to be convened soon. The conference will discuss the German question. Like other issues, this issue must seek a resolution acceptable to all parties participating in the conference, which requires a good will; a resolution must be sought that can comfort the mothers of Warsaw and Paris, the mothers of Prague and Rotterdam, and the mothers of Coventry and Minsk; the dangerous gambling must be ended, and the whole deck of cards must be discarded, not only those stained with oil, but also those stained with blood. On these cards, we see not kings and jacks, but Krupp and Kesselring, Guderian and Jakob Kaiser. Europe is unwilling to have despicable prime ministers again, nor is it willing to replay the past again and again, unwilling to redo Locarno—the place that opened the way for the "Steel Helmet" and Hindenburg. Europe is unwilling to see 1933 again, when Hitler relied on electoral tricks to seize power. Europe still remembers how many votes this sinner obtained, and also remembers how many innocent people he killed.
    The people of all countries hope for the success of the Four-Power Conference because the people of all countries want to live. They know that all European countries have a common interest, which is to worry about the occurrence of new aggression. Not long ago, representatives of various French parties visited Poland, including Socialists, Radical Socialists, and right-wingers. None of them were supporters of the new Polish political system. But they all understood that there was a common desire between the French and the Poles, which was the desire to defend their national borders from aggression. When the most dangerous moment for the survival of France itself occurred, no matter how great the differences among the French people were, they would unite to defend their motherland. This was the case during the years of German occupation, when Communists and Catholics fought side by side. We are seeing the same situation now. The November debates in parliament and the time-consuming presidential election both show France's reluctance to commit suicide. An angry protector wrote in the "New York Times": "France no longer exists, only the French exist." These fools do not understand history, otherwise they would understand that as long as there are French people, then France will exist now and in the future.
    The people of all countries not only hope for the success of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, they will fight for it. As long as Germany is prevented from joining a military alliance, Europe will breathe a sigh of relief, and the boundary dividing Germany into two parts will disappear; this boundary is not only a disgrace to the Germans, but also a danger to all mankind.
    The people of all countries hope that the New Year will bring peace to Asia. Why can't the Korean political conference be held? Why can't even the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war be fulfilled to this day? Some people may think that Soviet writers are biased, but no one would include the chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Indian general, in the "Reds." This Indian general spoke frankly about who wanted the agreement and who prevented the agreement. It is not the 18th century anymore. It should be understood that Asia has awakened and demands respect for its rights and demands peace.
    The difficult war in Indochina has bankrupted the Vietnamese people and also bankrupted France. Not long ago, the vast majority of French public opinion advocated peaceful negotiations with Vietnam. A third party—bloodthirsty and profiteering people—immediately intervened in this matter. But can it really be believed that the French will become German mercenaries, Asia will return to the state of foreign hereditary territories, and the war in Vietnam can be maintained for a long time after the armistice in Korea? No, peace is also knocking on the door of this country.
    Now everyone understands that a lasting peace cannot be established without the participation of representatives from the most populous country in the world—China—in this great cause. People who talk about this include British conservatives, Australian bishops, Prime Minister Nehru, Scandinavian ministers, and some leaders in Egypt. Everyone understands this, except for the politicians of a country who are still trying to make their chased-away stewards pretend to be the Chinese government. The disgusting farce is beginning to make everyone indignant, and we can say that in 1954 the people of all countries will strive for a conference of the five major powers.
    The people of all countries hope for the success of negotiations on banning atomic warfare and hydrogen bomb warfare. The Soviet government's proposal has received a good response even among people who usually do not agree with Soviet policies. Any honest person, no matter who he believes in and trusts, cannot be indifferent when thinking about the possible use of weapons that can slaughter millions of innocent people. Of course, all honest people hope to make the greatest invention of our century benefit mankind, but the people of all countries are indeed not children, and they understand that it is ridiculous to talk about using atomic energy to irrigate the Sahara Desert and the Gobi Desert while avoiding talking about banning atomic weapons that can destroy entire countries.
    So far, governments of various countries have put forward various plans. Plans can be debated, and agreements can be reached through debate. But few people would deny the rationality of the simple and universally acceptable proposal put forward by a country with atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons: that is, to undertake the sacred and unconditional obligation not to use weapons of mass destruction. All mankind welcomes the New Year with this hope, hoping that such an agreement will be concluded, hoping that we will not see, and our children will not see, major scientific inventions being used to destroy civilization.
    What the people of all countries need is not bombs, not ruins, not war, but life, peace, and happiness. The idea of easing international tensions and the willingness to strive for fruitful negotiations and agreements have become popular among the broadest strata of all nations. No matter how broad the peace movement is, the number of people who yearn for peace is even greater. Various political groups and parties, various religious organizations and pacifist organizations, as well as various social figures and cultural workers who have not participated in the peace movement and may not participate in the peace movement are now trying to ease international tensions. It is precisely for this reason that the World Peace Council has put forward the proposal for an international conference, where various different viewpoints can be compared and some resolutions acceptable to everyone can be reached.
    The first responses to the World Peace Council's proposal show that the idea of such a conference has even won the approval of some people who have been skeptical of the peace movement until now. Everyone understands that the meeting of representatives of public opinion from various countries will itself promote the creation of an atmosphere conducive to diplomatic negotiations. This meeting of the people of all countries not only does not hinder negotiations between governments of various countries, but also makes negotiations proceed smoothly. I hope that this international conference to ease international tensions will be convened soon and will help make 1954 a truly peaceful year.
    Peace is what everyone needs. Peace is what those who are striving forward, building a new society or fighting for a new society need. They know that the world of labor will conquer with labor. Peace is also what those who yearn to defend the society in which they live need. If they are not fools, not neurotic people, and not adventurers, they should understand that war will destroy what they want to protect. This is why we can discuss and reach agreements with people who have different ideas, different hobbies, and different habits.
    The coming year can determine many things, and a great responsibility rests on all peace defenders: we have the right to rejoice in great changes, but it is too early for us to talk about the victory of peace. The people of all countries should strive to achieve this victory, and we believe that they will achieve it.
    We wish the people of the world peace in the New Year.
    We wish the American people peace. Indeed, now the American people must understand that we wish them happiness and not bankruptcy, peace and not hydrogen bomb mania. May every nation live in the way it likes. No Soviet person has ever infringed upon the American way of life.
    May the New Year be a happy year for the brave Korean people, and may the Korean people rebuild their beautiful city from the ashes more quickly.
    May the coming year be a happy year for wise, kind, and hardworking China, and may our friendship always accompany China.
    May 1954 be a prosperous and peaceful year for ancient India and its happy and proud people.
    May the British people have peace and success in the New Year. When the beautiful greenery of ancient Britain begins to shine in the spring, may nothing darken the mood of mothers taking care of their children playing.
    May the Italian people, whom we are close to and love, see peace under the olive trees and see the clear blue sky.
    We hope that the New Year will be a kind year for all our friends. May glorious Warsaw become more beautiful, and may the bells of ancient Prague ring out the bells of peace.
    We wholeheartedly wish France happiness, and what we hope for from France is the same as what it hopes for itself—we believe in France, and we know that it will never give up its existence and will never cease to be France.
    May the lives of the Soviet people, who have undergone many trials and have painstakingly obtained the right to great happiness through merit and labor, become better and brighter. No matter what others say, they should enjoy this happiness. May our country move forward again, may our country have more golden ears of wheat, inspiring books, and happy eyes.
    May 1954 be a year in which peace penetrates everywhere.

专栏：

    走向和平
    苏联　爱伦堡
    十年以前，人们在掩避所里，在防空洞里，在战壕里，在实行灯火管制的城市中晦暗而阴冷的房屋里，在不安全的战争的公路上，在游击队的篝火旁边，在战俘营中，在废墟和灰烬之间来迎接新年。那时的生活是艰苦的，但是各国人民还是非常愉快地来迎接一九四四年：他们知道最困难的日子已经过去了，天秤上的盘子动了——世界向和平跨了一步。在斯大林格勒战胜压迫各国人民的黑暗势力的胜利，鼓舞了人们。苏联军队越过第聂泊河向西方推进。战斗在意大利进行着。欧洲各国中的反抗增加了：波兰和斯洛伐克的森林，撒哇的群山和里摩日的槲林，都看到了英勇的游击队。希特勒的
  “新欧洲”，这个建筑在残暴、谎言和奴役上的空幻的帝国，开始动摇了；人人已经看到，人类胜利的时刻不远了。
    当想到全世界对新的一九五四年的愿望时，这些回忆就不由涌上心头。各国人民在经过长时期的艰难、惊恐和牺牲之后，抱着一种任何人都不能称之为轻率的希望来迎接这个新年，经历过许许多多苦难的各国人民，已不是天真幼稚的少年，他们知道，和平力量的巩固要用坚忍精神、艰苦的劳动、大胆无畏和巨大的意志力来偿付。正像十年以前一样，天秤上的盘子动了——和平要胜利了。
    朝鲜军事行动的停止，不仅使这一个勇敢的国家从前所未闻的和它不应得的恐怖中获得解放，而且这是理智的第一个大胜利，它给了世界人民希望，鼓舞了世界人民。美国的评论员曾写道，三年战争的结果未分胜负。我们不管这些战略家们的议论，只说出一件事：朝鲜的骇人听闻的战争，使这个暴力在精神、原则和政策方面都遭到了失败。朝鲜停战给各国人民指出，如果能够熄灭那熊熊战火，那就能够及时制止那敢于挑起战火的轻举妄动的或者说是可恶的人。
    过去的一年之中，一切事情有了多么大的变化啊！和平力量是加强到现在很少有人直接叫嚣战争了，这些叫嚣在一年以前还是海洋彼岸许多政客所喜爱的口头禅呢。报纸的版面上，不仅关于使用汽油弹的恶毒战报消失了，而且连关于向什么地方投掷原子弹的肆无忌惮的建议也消失了。这些建议是在参议院的历次会议之间和历次鸡尾酒会之间经常提出的。现在可以听到，汽油弹的拥护者们怎样赞扬协商的思想，以及原子弹的爱好者们怎样赌咒发誓他们非常爱好和平。当然，我们并不是说良心已经觉醒了，甚至最易轻信的人也不会把改了装的人当做再生的人看待。但是，如果一些政客改变了他们的辞汇，这是因为千百万人们的思想和感情改变了的原故，是力量的对比关系改变了的原故。重要的不在于这些改了装的人们说的是什么话，重要的是，他们为什么开始以新方式说话。
    我曾经在荷兰住过几个星期，住在保护这个国家以防海的侵袭的堤坝附近。我不会忘记，那些在三更半夜被唤醒了的人们是怎样沉默着，耐心地工作并战胜了自然力。我曾看到，法国兰得省的农民怎样扑灭林中大火，在我国北方严寒的夜里，园艺家们怎样点起篝火，用烟幕来保护脆弱的树木以防冻坏。我曾看到过，在战后的第一年，集体农庄庄员，主要是女庄员，怎样建筑起他们那被烧毁了的村庄；在华沙，建筑工人们怎样在夜间探照灯的灯光下，从灰烬中重建他们那座可爱的城。人们在保卫和平的运动中也曾这样工作过：不吝惜力量，在一些国家中甚至是不吝惜生命，从这家到那家，走遍家家户户，走遍大街小巷，走遍城市，敲动每一颗心，呼吁任何一个人的理智，呼吁各国人民的良心。
    西方报纸轻蔑地对和平保卫者的号召隐讳不谈，这是很久以前的事吗？在许多国家中，那些坚持主张和平谈判的人们被宣布是疯子或是罪犯，这是很久以前的事吗？保卫和平运动还没有满五年，在这个短短的时期中它获得了这样的成就：现在参加保卫和平运动的人的话，已被他们的全体同胞在任何一个城市和任何一个十字街头坚信不渝地重复着。
    世界和平理事会不只一次地指出，不能让复仇的和侵略的势力恢复起来；世界和平理事会坚决主张，统一的德国的建立可以带来安宁，如果德国不参加任何军事联盟，那么它就不会成为各邻国的威胁。现在同意这个看法的不仅有大多数法国人，而且也有那个不久以前战争势力认为对它们来说还是最好的一个国会中的大多数人。我们在反对“欧洲军”的人们之间看到有各种集团的代表：激进社会党人赫里欧和达拉第，戴高乐将军的信徒，社会党人，天主教徒；这些人与和平保卫者一道反对恢复任何形式的国防军，反对践踏法国的国家主权和轻视它的民族安全。
    在世界的另一端，我们看到和平保卫者对于在他国领土上建立军事基地和对于侵略公约的谴责，现在已获得世界上最大的国家之一的领袖的支持。我们知道，拥护世界和平理事会理事克其鲁和索克的话的，不单纯是那么多的委员会或是那么多签名，而是整个的印度。
    斯堪的那维亚半岛上的一个国家的外交部长不久以前宣称，世界和平理事会的决议是世界舆论的喉舌，这不是足以表征一切的吗？难道几年之前他能说这种话吗？难道从前比利时的外交部长在议会中回答伊莎贝丽·布伦姆时，能够承认世界和平理事会中的辩论的全部重要性吗？难道在一年以前，我们能看到智利的众议院赞成它的议长去出席世界和平理事会的会议吗？难道那时中东和近东最著名的宗教界人士和社会人士能够公开把本民族的愿望和保卫和平思想的胜利连在一起吗？
    是的，世界上有了许多变化，在发生的这些变化之中，保卫和平运动起着很大的作用。希望在千百万人们的心灵中复活起来了：希望结束人人厌恶的冷战，希望生活更轻快些，更安适些，而且要更不愧于人的称号些。苏联的和平建议获得各国的各种不同社会集团的赞扬，以至于使反对协商的人也不得不伪装起来，不得不随机应变和假仁假义一番。
    应该相信，四国外长会议很快就会准备召开。会议将讨论德国问题。这个问题和其他问题一样，必须寻求参加会议各方都能接受的决议，而这一点就需要一个善良的意志；必须寻求一个能安慰华沙和巴黎的母亲，布拉格和鹿特丹的母亲，考文垂和明斯克的母亲的决议；必须结束危险的赌博，抛掉那一整副纸牌，不仅要抛掉那些油污了的、而且还要抛掉那染有血迹的牌。在这些牌上我们看到的不是国王和杰克，而是克虏伯和凯塞林，古德林和雅各布·凯撒。欧洲既不愿意再要卑污的内阁总理，也不愿意一次再一次地重演过去的事，不愿意再重做罗加诺——这个为“钢盔队”和兴登堡打开道路的地方，欧洲不愿意再看见一九三三年，那时希特勒依靠着选举的把戏，握到了政权。欧洲还记得这个罪人获得了多少票数，也记得他杀害了多少无辜的人。
    各国人民希望着四国会议的成功，因为各国人民想生活。他们知道，所有欧洲的国家有一个共同的利益，就是全都担心发生新的侵略。不久以前，一些法国各党派代表曾访问过波兰，其中既有社会党人，也有激进社会党人，还有右倾分子。他们之间没有任何一个人是新波兰政治制度的拥护者。但是他们全都明白，法国人和波兰人之间有着一个共同的愿望，就是保卫自己国家边疆不受侵略的愿望。当发生了法国本身存亡问题的最危险的时刻，无论法国人之间的分歧如何的大，他们都会团结起来保卫自己的祖国。在德国人占领的年代里就曾有过这种情况，那时共产党人和天主教徒曾并肩作战。现在我们也看到了同样情况。国会里的十一月的争论和选举总统的费时，都表明了法国不情愿去自杀。有一位发了脾气的保护人在“纽约时报”上写道：“法国不再存在，存在的只有法国人”。这些愚人是不懂得历史的，否则他们就会明白，只要有法国人存在，那么，现在和将来也都会有法国存在。
    各国人民不仅希望四国外长会议的成功，他们将为此而斗争。只要防止德国加入军事同盟，欧洲就会轻松地呼一口气，把德国分裂成两个部分的界限就会消失；这个界限不仅对德国人是一种耻辱，而且对于全人类是一种危险。
    各国人民希望新年会给亚洲带来和平。为什么朝鲜的政治会议开不成呢？为什么至今甚至连遣返战俘的协议都不能履行呢？可能有人认为苏联作家有偏私，但是任何人都未必会把中立国遣返委员会主席，印度的将军列入“赤党”之内，这位印度将军曾直率地谈过谁要协议和谁阻止协议。现在已不是十八世纪，应当明白，亚洲已经睡醒，它要求尊重自己的权利，要求和平。
    印度支那的艰巨的战争使越南人民破产，它也使法国破产。不久以前，绝大部分的法国舆论都主张与越南进行和平谈判。第三者——嗜血的和发横财的人们——立刻干预这件事。但是能够真的认为法国人会变成德国的雇佣兵，亚洲又回到外国世袭领地的状况，而在朝鲜停战以后越南的战争仍能维持很久吗？不，和平也正在敲这个国家的大门。
    现在大家都明白了，没有世界上人数最多的国家——中国——的代表参加这个重大事业，就不能建立起持久的和平。谈论这件事的人有英国的保守党人，澳洲的主教，尼赫鲁总理，斯堪的那维亚的部长们，埃及的一些领导者。所有的人都明白这点，不明白的只是那些仍企图使自己被打跑了的管家冒充为中国政府的一个国家的政客们。令人厌恶的滑稽剧开始使大家愤慨，我们可以说，一九五四年各国人民将会争取到五大国会议。
    各国人民希望着关于禁止原子战争和氢弹战争谈判的成功。苏联政府的建议甚至在平常不赞成苏联政策的人们之间都获得了良好的反应。任何一个诚实的人，他无论相信谁和信任谁，当想到可能使用能够屠杀数百万无辜的人的武器时，是不能无动于衷的。当然，所有诚实的人都希望使我们世纪的最伟大的发明为人类造福，但是，各国人民确实并不是孩子，他们明白，当一边谈着借助原子能来灌溉撒哈拉大沙漠和戈壁大沙漠，同时却避而不谈禁止能破坏整个国家的原子武器的问题，这是可笑的。
    到现在为止各国政府提出了各种计划。计划是可以争论，而且通过争论可以达致协议。但是未必有人会否认为一个拥有原子武器和氢武器国家所提出来的朴实的和大家都能接收的建议的合理性：就是承担起不使用大规模毁灭性武器的神圣的和无条件的义务。全人类抱着这个希望来迎接新年，希望这样的协议将会缔结，希望我们不要看到，我们的孩子也不要看到重大的科学发明会用来破坏文明。
    各国人民需要的不是炸弹、不是废墟、不是战争，而是生活、和平、幸福。缓和国际紧张局势的思想、争取富有成果的谈判和协议的意愿，已经普及到所有民族的最广大阶层。无论和平运动是如何广阔，渴望和平的人数是更多的。各种政治团体和党派，各种宗教组织和和平主义的组织，以及没有参加和平运动，而且未必会参加和平运动的各种社会人士和文化工作者，现在都企图来缓和国际紧张局势。正因如此，世界和平理事会才提出了国际会议的建议，在这个国际会议上可以比一比各种不同的观点，可以达致大家都能接受的一些决议。
    对世界和平理事会的建议的第一批反应说明了，这种会议的思想甚至博得了迄今对和平运动表示怀疑的一些人的赞同。大家都明白，各国舆论界代表的会议本身，就会促进创造对外交谈判有利的气氛。各国人民的这种会议不仅不妨害各国政府之间的谈判，而且使谈判能顺利进行。我希望这种缓和国际紧张局势的国际会议很快地就会召开，并有助于把一九五四年变成真正和平的一年。
    和平是大家需要的。和平是努力前进，建设新社会或为新社会而战斗的人所需要的。他们知道劳动的世界将以劳动战胜。和平也是渴望保卫他们所生活的那个社会的人们所需要的。如果他们不是糊涂人，不是有神经病的人和冒险家，他们就应当明白，战争将会毁灭他们想要保护的东西。这就是为什么我们能够和那些思想不同，爱好不同，习惯不同的人们在一起商谈而且能够达致协议的缘故。
    来临的这一年能够决定许多的事情，伟大的责任落在所有的和平保卫者的身上：我们有权为伟大的变化而欢欣，但是我们谈和平的胜利还嫌早些。各国人民应当争取达到这种胜利，我们相信他们会争取到的。
    我们祝全世界人民在新的一年中获得和平。
    我们祝美国人民和平。的确，现在美国人民要明白，我们祝他们的是幸福而不是破产，是安宁而不是氢弹狂。愿每一个民族按照他所喜欢的方式去生活。任何一个苏联人从未侵害过美国的生活方式。
    愿新年对于勇敢的朝鲜人民是幸福的一年，愿朝鲜人民更快地从灰烬中重建起来他们的美妙的城市。
    愿来临的这一年对智慧的、善良的和勤劳的中国是幸福的一年，而我们的友爱永远伴随着中国。
    愿一九五四年对于古老的印度和它的快乐而自豪的人是富裕和和平的一年。
    愿英国人在新的一年中得到安宁和成功，当古老英国的奇美的绿荫开始闪烁的春天，愿什么东西都不会使照顾着孩子玩耍的母亲们心情暗淡起来。
    愿我们所亲近的和爱戴的意大利人民在橄榄树下看到和平，看到万里无云的蔚蓝天空。
    我们希望，新年对于我们所有的朋友是善良的一年。愿光荣的华沙变得更美丽，愿古老的布拉格的钟敲出和平的钟声。
    我们全心全意地祝法国幸福，我们希望于法国的和它本身所希望的是一样——我们相信法国，我们知道，任何时候她都不会放弃自己的存在，不会不再是法国。
    愿我们经过许多考验的，以功绩和劳动而刻苦取得伟大幸福权利的苏联人的生活更加美好和光辉。不管别人如何，他们是应当享有这种幸福的。愿我国再向前迈进，愿我国有更多的黄金色的麦穗，使人鼓舞的书籍，愉快的眼睛。
    愿一九五四年是和平深入各处的一年。
