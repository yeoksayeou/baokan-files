    Lenin's works are being published in increasing numbers in our country. With the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, Leninism—Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution—was gradually introduced to China. From 1917 to 1919, Chinese newspapers and magazines only had fragmentary and incomplete records of Lenin and the Russian Revolution. By 1920, the Shanghai "New Youth" monthly, the "Communist" monthly, and the Beijing "Dawn" magazine had begun to introduce Lenin's works and speeches, such as "The Right of Nations to Self-Determination" (excerpts from Lenin's report on the Party Program at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)), "New Problems in Russia" (Lenin's speech at the Ninth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)), "The Economy of the Transition Period" (i.e., "Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat"), "Updating the Old System" (i.e., "From Destroying the Old System of the Past to Creating a New System"), etc. In 1921, the Guangzhou People's Publishing House first translated and published the single editions of "The Establishment of Labor-Peasant Associations" (i.e., Lenin's "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" in 1918) and "Discussion of the Plan of Action" (i.e., Lenin's "Letters on Tactics" in 1917). Before the First Domestic Revolutionary War in China in 1927, works such as "Backward Europe and Advanced Asia," "China After the Revolution," "The War in China," "The Awakening of Asia," and "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" had Chinese translations.

    During the Second and Third Domestic Revolutionary Wars, the Chinese Communist Party, both in the Liberated Areas and in the Kuomintang reactionary-controlled areas, attached great importance to the publication of Lenin's works, using them as weapons to guide the revolution. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, classic works such as "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," "State and Revolution," "Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution," "Revolution and Renegade Kautsky," "From the February Revolution to the October Revolution," "The Development of Capitalism In Russia," "The Agrarian Programme of Social-Democracy in the First Russian Revolution, 1905-1907", and "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism" were successively published. During the Anti-Japanese War and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, in order to enable the Chinese people to study Leninism more systematically, the Yan'an Liberation Press published "Selected Works of Lenin." During this period, the translations of Lenin's works published in the past were revised, and some also had new translations.

    In the Kuomintang reactionary-controlled areas, the publication of Lenin's works was prohibited and suppressed; however, the Chinese people still translated and published many of Lenin's works through various channels. The most Lenin's secretly published works came from Shanghai. After the victory of the Chinese Revolution in 1949, the number of Lenin's works published and distributed in China increased substantially. From 1949 to 1953, the state-owned People's Publishing House had published 43 Chinese translations of Lenin's works (including "Lenin and Stalin on China," "Lenin and Stalin on the State," and "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction"), printing more than 3.7 million copies. Among them, "State and Revolution," "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," and "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues" each sold more than 200,000 copies. In order to meet the needs of the vast number of domestic readers, the International Bookstore also imported 27 Chinese translations of Lenin's works published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House from the Soviet International Book Company during the same period, distributing more than 3.3 million copies. The state-owned People's Publishing House is strengthening the publication of Lenin's works and is preparing to publish the first volume of "Complete Works of Lenin" this year, and will soon publish the second volume of the two-volume "Selected Works of Lenin" (the first volume was published in December 1953). The state-owned People's Publishing House also plans to publish newly translated works such as "Conspectus of Hegel’s Science of Logic," "Letter to American Workers," and "Report on the Attitude of the Proletariat to Petty-Bourgeois Democracy," and organize and publish works such as "Socialism and Religion" within this year. Lenin's works guided the Chinese people to achieve the complete victory of the democratic revolution in the past, and are now guiding the Chinese people to carry out the great socialist construction. Its brilliance will forever illuminate the road forward for the Chinese people.

    列宁的著作在我国广泛出版
    我国正在越来越多地出版列宁的著作。随着伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，列宁主义——帝国主义与无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义，就被陆续地介绍到中国来了。在一九一七年到一九一九年，中国报纸和杂志对于列宁和俄国革命只有片断的不完全的记载。到了一九二○年，上海的“新青年”月刊、“共产党”月刊和北京的“曙光”杂志已开始介绍列宁的著作和演说，如“民族自决”（摘译列宁在俄国共产党（布）第八次代表大会上关于党纲的报告）、“俄罗斯的新问题”（列宁在俄国共产党（布）第九次代表大会上的演说）、“过渡时代的经济”（即“无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治”）、“旧制更新”（即“从破坏历来的旧制度到创造新制度”）等。一九二一年，广州的人民出版社第一次翻译出版了“劳农会之建设”（即列宁一九一八年的“苏维埃政权底当前任务”）和“讨论进行计划书”（即列宁一九一七年的“论策略书”）的单行本。到一九二七年中国第一次国内革命战争以前，“落后的欧洲与先进的亚洲”、“革命后的中国”、“中国战争”、“亚洲的醒悟”、“左派幼稚病”等著作都有了中国文字的译本。
    在第二、第三次国内革命战争时期，中国共产党无论在解放区或在国民党反动统治地区，都很重视列宁著作的出版，以之作为指导革命的武器。在第二次国内革命战争时期中，“帝国主义是资本主义底最高阶段”、“国家与革命”、“两个策略”、“革命与叛徒考茨基”、“二月革命到十月革命”、“俄国资本主义的发展”、“俄国农民问题与土地政纲”、“唯物论与经验批判论”等经典著作都先后出版。在抗日战争时期和第三次国内革命战争时期，为了使中国人民能够比较系统地学习列宁主义，延安解放社出版了“列宁选集”。在这一时期中，并对过去所出版的列宁著作的译本作了校订，有的还有了新的译本。
    在国民党反动统治地区内，列宁著作的出版是遭受禁止和压迫的；但是中国人民仍然通过各种途径，翻译和出版了很多列宁的著作。这种秘密出版的列宁著作，以上海出版的为最多。一九四九年中国革命胜利后，列宁著作在中国的出版、发行数字大量地增加。国营人民出版社从一九四九年到一九五三年止，已出版列宁著作中译本四十三种（包括“列宁斯大林论中国”、“列宁斯大林论国家”和“列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”三种），印行了三百七十多万册。其中“国家与革命”、“帝国主义论”、“左派幼稚病”、“青年团的任务”等，每种销行都在二十万册以上。为了满足国内广大读者的需要，国际书店在同一时期中，还从苏联国际图书公司，进口了莫斯科外文出版局出版的列宁著作中译本二十七种，发行了三百三十多万册。国营人民出版社正加强列宁著作的出版工作，准备在今年内出版“列宁全集”第一卷，并在最近出版两卷集“列宁文选”第二卷（第一卷已在一九五三年十二月出版）。国营人民出版社还计划在今年年内出版新翻译的“黑格尔哲学史纲要”、“给美国工人的信”和“关于无产阶级对小资产阶级民主态度的报告”，整理出版“社会主义与宗教”等著作。列宁的著作过去指导中国人民取得了民主主义革命的彻底胜利，现在又指导着中国人民进行伟大的社会主义建设。它的光辉永远照耀着中国人民前进的道路。
