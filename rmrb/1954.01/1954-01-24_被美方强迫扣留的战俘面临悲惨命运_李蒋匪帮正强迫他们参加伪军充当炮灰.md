Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 23rd: Special correspondent report: So-called United Nations Commander Hull announced today that, starting from 00:01 this morning, all war prisoners forcibly taken away by the US side have so-called "civilian" status. Hull said that the US side will "fully respect" the rights of prisoners of war stipulated in the "'mandate'," and that "prisoners of war who have not chosen repatriation have the right to enjoy freedom as civilians," and that from today, prisoners of war "have become free men."

	However, the facts are the best answer. The war prisoners forcibly detained by the US side are facing a tragic fate today.

	Taylor, the commander of the US Eighth Army, has signed a contract in Seoul with representatives of Li Seung-man and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to transfer prisoners of war, handing over more than 7,500 Korean prisoners of war and more than 14,000 Chinese prisoners of war to the Li and Chiang bandit gangs like pigs. These prisoners of war, who Hull calls "civilians" and "free men," will be forcibly incorporated into the armies of the Li and Chiang bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder. This is their only "freedom" and "right."

	Li Seung-man's officials have stated more than once that prisoners of war who fall into their hands must serve as soldiers for Li Seung-man and die for him, with no room for escape. Just as the US side was talking about "releasing" prisoners of war as "civilians," a Li Seung-man officer in charge of "handling" prisoners of war said that although the prisoners of war "are technically 'free'," "all prisoners of war will remain in their hands, 'indefinitely'." Obviously, these prisoners of war will be imprisoned in detention camps until they are forcibly incorporated into the Li puppet army.

	The Li Seung-man bandit gang originally intended to use the method of forcing prisoners of war to "voluntarily" enlist in order to cover themselves up, but, according to the Associated Press, despite various threats and intimidation, 70 percent of all prisoners of war still openly stated that they were unwilling to serve in the military during the "screening." After this "screening," "the South Korean government was so shocked by the unwillingness of these returned personnel to join the army that it had to treat them all as conscription targets," regardless of whether they were "voluntary" or not.

	Chinese prisoners of war transferred by the US side to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are being transported to Taiwan under the escort of US Navy fighter jets and destroyers. According to American news agencies, Kuomintang bandit officers escorting the prisoners of war are using "the strictest military discipline" to deal with them. Those prisoners of war who revealed their willingness to be repatriated in Dongchang-ri are being tortured or thrown into the sea. News from Taipei indicates that these prisoners of war being escorted to Taiwan will arrive in batches starting on the 25th, and they will spend three months of fascist terror in concentration camps before being forcibly incorporated into the Kuomintang remnant army.

	All of these are the tragic encounters of the "free men" who were "released" as "civilians" in Hull's mouth. No amount of rhetoric can cover up the bloody facts. The US attempt to use prisoners of war who have been trampled on and deprived of all human rights as tools for "Cold War" propaganda is just lifting a rock to drop it on one's own feet. The US authorities cannot escape the responsibility for their crime of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

### 被美方强迫扣留的战俘面临悲惨命运  李蒋匪帮正强迫他们参加伪军充当炮灰

    被美方强迫扣留的战俘面临悲惨命运
    李蒋匪帮正强迫他们参加伪军充当炮灰
    【新华社开城二十三日电】本社特派记者报道：所谓联合国军总司令赫尔今天宣布说，从今晨零时一分起，所有被美方以武力押走的战俘已具有所谓“平民”身份。赫尔说什么美方将“十分尊重”
  “‘职权范围’中规定的战俘的权利”，“没有选择遣返的战俘都有权享受作为平民的自由”，并说，从今天起，战俘“已成为自由人”。
    但是，事实是最好的回答。被美方强迫扣留的战俘今天正面临着悲惨的命运。
    美国第八军军长泰勒今天已在汉城和李承晚、国民党匪帮的代表签订了移交战俘的契约，把七千五百多名朝鲜战俘和一万四千多名中国战俘当作猪仔一样交到李、蒋匪帮的手中。这些战俘，也就是赫尔所说的“平民”、“自由人”，将被强制编入李、蒋匪帮的军队去充当炮灰。这就是他们唯一的“自由”和“权利”。
    李承晚的官员已经不止一次地表明：落入他们手中的战俘必须替李承晚当兵送死，绝无逃避的余地。正当美方大谈其“释放”战俘为“平民”的时候，负责“处理”战俘的李承晚军官说：虽然战俘们“在技术上说已获‘自由’”，但是“全部战俘将留在他们手中，‘期限未定’”。显然，这些战俘将被囚禁在拘留营中直到被强制编入李伪军为止。
    李承晚匪帮原来打算利用逼迫战俘“自愿”入伍的办法来替自己进行掩饰，但是，据美联社报道，尽管进行了种种威胁和恫吓，全部战俘在“甄别”时仍有百分之七十的人公开表示不愿当兵。在这一“甄别”以后，“韩国政府对这些被送还的人员不愿参加军队一事大为震惊，以致它不得不把他们都当作征兵的对象”，而不管什么“自愿”不“自愿”。
    为美方移交给国民党匪帮的中国战俘，正在美国海军战斗机和驱逐舰的押送下被运往台湾的途中。据美国的通讯社报道说，押运战俘的国民党匪帮军官正在用“最严格的军纪”对付他们。而那些曾在东场里透露了遣返意愿的战俘则正在被拷打或者被投入大海。来自台北的消息表明，这些被押往台湾的战俘将从二十五日起陆续到达，他们将在集中营中度过三个月的法西斯恐怖的生活，然后被强编入国民党残余军队中。
    所有这些就是赫尔口中被“释放”为“平民”的“自由人”的悲惨遭遇。任何花言巧语遮盖不了血淋淋的事实。美方企图把被践踏、被剥夺一切人权的战俘当作“冷战”宣传的工具，只不过是搬起石头打自己的脚。美国当局绝不能逃脱对它强迫扣留战俘的罪行所应负的责任。
