    Zhejiang Province Lanxi County Grain Bureau
    Should Emphasize Grain Storage Work
    Reader Chai Benying from the Tonglu Winery, a local state-owned enterprise in Zhejiang Province, writes: On December 3rd of last year, our factory purchased over 30,000 jin of red sorghum from the Lanxi County Grain Bureau, which was collected from the Ma'an Xu warehouse in Lanxi County. After inspection at the factory, we found that the temperature of this batch of grain was as high as 39 degrees Celsius (while the room temperature was only 9 degrees Celsius), and the moisture content reached over 22% (according to general grain storage standards, the grain temperature should be the same as or slightly higher than the room temperature, and the maximum moisture content should not exceed 15%). If this batch of grain is not actively salvaged, it will rot.
    According to our factory's purchasing comrade, the warehouses of the purchasing stations under the Lanxi County Grain Bureau also store a considerable amount of red sorghum with the same moisture content and temperature. It is suggested that they immediately conduct a comprehensive inspection of the grain stored in the warehouses of their subordinate purchasing stations and take effective measures to ensure that the grain is not damaged.

    浙江省兰溪县粮食局
    应该重视粮食保管工作
    浙江省地方国营桐庐酒厂读者柴本莹来信：去年十二月三日我厂向兰溪县粮食局购买红粮（即高粱）三万余斤，在兰溪县马安徐仓库提取。到厂后，经过我们检查，发现这批粮食温度高达摄氏三十九度（当时室温仅九度），水分达百分之二十二以上（根据一般粮食保管标准，粮食温度应和室温相符或稍高于室温，水分最高不得超过百分之十五）。这批粮食如果再不积极设法挽救，就会霉烂。
    据我厂采购同志回厂说：兰溪县粮食局所属收购站的仓库中，存有同样水分和温度的红粮还有不少。建议他们立即对所属收购站的仓库存粮进行一次全面检查，并采取有效措施，保证不使粮食受到损失。
