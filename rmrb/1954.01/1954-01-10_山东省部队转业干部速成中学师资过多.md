    Shandong Province Troops Transfer Cadre Accelerated Middle School Has Too Many Teachers
    Reader Zhou Mulin writes: In the summer of 1953, after graduating from the Geography Accelerated Class of the History and Geography Department of Shandong Normal College, I was assigned to work in the Shandong Province Troops Transfer Cadre Accelerated Middle School. A total of 35 of us came together (12 from the Geography Department, 12 from the Chemistry Department, 7 from the Physiology Department, and 4 from the History Department), and we first arrived at the main school. At that time, among the three branch schools under the main school, only Branch School No. 1 had middle school classes (originally only three classes, now six), and the rest were accelerated literacy classes, junior primary school classes, and senior primary school classes; moreover, before we arrived, the school had already been equipped with a group of teachers. The school only has six middle school classes in total. How could they use so many middle school teachers? Therefore, the school asked us to take on primary school work. We believed that this practice was stockpiling middle school teachers and violating the principle of rational use of talent, and we raised our opinions to the leadership. However, the school would rather have middle school teachers do other work than return the surplus teachers to the Provincial Department of Education for distribution to places where teachers were needed. Therefore, many chemistry graduates were assigned to manage simple instruments such as globes, color plates, water pump models, test tubes, and alcohol lamps, and many geography, history, and biology graduates were assigned to teaching affairs work, while more people were assigned to be primary school teachers (five students returned to the Department of Education because they insisted on their opinions). That's not all, later, 24 graduates from the Jinan Normal Middle School Teacher Training Class also came and were all retained to work as primary school teachers.
    Regarding the above situation, I reported it to the Dazhong Daily twice in August last year. On September 29th, I received a reply from the Personnel Department of the Provincial Department of Education forwarded by the newspaper, which generally stated: After investigation, the situation I reported was true. The Provincial People's Government decided that all teachers who had been transferred, except for a few who could be retained for teaching and research work, should be used for teaching work; if there were any surplus, they could consult with the Personnel Department and consider transferring them out. As for those temporarily working in primary school education, they could be patiently persuaded to settle down and work. However, until now, the actual situation has not changed in the slightest. I hope that relevant departments will quickly and conscientiously handle this matter.

### 山东省部队转业干部速成中学师资过多

专栏：读者来信摘要

    山东省部队转业干部速成中学师资过多
    读者周慕蔺来信：一九五三年暑假我在山东师范学院史地系地理速成班毕业后，被分配到山东省部队转业干部速成中学工作。我们同来的共三十五人（地理系十二人、化学系十二人、生理系七人、历史系四人），首先到了总校。当时总校所属的三个分校里，只有一分校有中学班（原来只有三班，现在有六班），其余都是速成识字班、初小班和高小班；而且在我们未来时，学校已配备了一批师资。学校一共只有六班中学班，那里用得了这许多中学教师呢？因此校方就要我们担任小学工作。我们认为这种作法是积压中学师资、违背合理使用人材原则的，曾向领导方面提出意见。但校方宁可叫中学教师做其他工作，却不愿把多余教师退回省教育厅分配到需要教员的地方去。因此，不少化学系毕业生被分配做管理地球仪、七色版、抽水机模型、试管酒精灯等简单仪器的工作，不少地理、历史、生物等系的毕业生做了教务工作，而更多的人都被分配任小学教师（有五个同学因坚持意见，回了教育厅）。这还不算，以后又来了济南师范中学师资训练班毕业生二十四人，也全部留下担任了小学教师工作。
    以上情况，我在去年八月间曾两次向大众日报社反映。九月二十九日我收到报社转来省教育厅人事处的复信，大意说：经调查，我反映的情况属实。省人民政府决定：已调去的教师除个别可留作教学研究工作外，其余应全部用作教学工作；如有多余，可会同人事厅研究，酌情调出。至于暂作小学教育工作的，可耐心说服使其安心工作。可是，直到现在，实际情况没有丝毫改变，我希望有关部门迅速认真处理这件事情。
