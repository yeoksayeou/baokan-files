    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 22nd - General Li Sang-cho, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, wrote to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, requesting the immediate dispatch of a mobile neutral inspection team to Incheon to investigate the incident of the US side's serious violation of the Armistice Agreement, interference with, and obstruction of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team stationed in Incheon from performing its duties. The Incheon Neutral Nations Inspection Team was deprived by the US side of the right to supervise and inspect the port, as granted by the Armistice Agreement, on the afternoon of January 20th and the morning of January 21st, and was unable to perform its inspection work in the port of Incheon.
    In his letter, General Li Sang-cho stated: According to the copies of the Incheon Neutral Nations Inspection Team's Special Report No. 114 of January 20th and the Special Report No. 116 of January 21st by the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the team, received by the Korean-Chinese side from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the US liaison officer stationed in Incheon notified the Incheon Neutral Nations Inspection Team on the 20th to cease the team's inspection work in the port on the afternoon of January 20th and the morning of January 21st. The US liaison officer also claimed to be acting on the orders of his commander, prohibiting the team from entering the port.
    General Li Sang-cho pointed out: The US side's actions in Incheon of interfering with and preventing the Neutral Nations Inspection Team from performing its duties and tasks seriously violated Paragraph 13(d) and Paragraph 17 of the Armistice Agreement. Paragraph 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement stipulates that the commanders of both sides shall "provide full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation" when the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams are performing their duties and tasks.  Paragraph 17 stipulates that the commanders of both sides must actively cooperate with the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission "to achieve compliance with the letter and spirit of all provisions of this Armistice Agreement."

    我方要求中立国监察委员会派遣机动小组
    立即调查美方在仁川违反停战协定的事件
    【新华社开城二十二日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军写信给中立国监察委员会，要求立即派遣一个机动中立国视察小组前往仁川，调查美方严重违反停战协定、干涉并阻止驻仁川中立国视察小组执行任务的事件。仁川中立国视察小组在一月二十日下午及二十一日上午被美方剥夺了停战协定所赋予的在口岸进行监督和视察的权利，未能在仁川港口执行其视察工作。
    李相朝将军在信中说：根据朝中方面从中立国监察委员会收到的仁川中立国视察小组一月二十日的第一一四号特别报告及该小组波兰和捷克斯洛伐克组员一月二十一日第一一六号特别报告的副本，美方驻仁川联络官在二十日通知仁川中立国视察小组，在一月二十日下午及二十一日上午停止小组在港口的视察工作。美方联络官并声称奉其司令官的命令，禁止小组进入港口。
    李相朝将军指出：美方在仁川干涉和阻止中立国视察小组执行其职司与任务的行为，严重违反了停战协定第十三款午项和第十七款。停战协定第十三款午项规定：双方司令官在中立国视察小组执行其职司与任务时，应“给予充分保护及一切可能的协助与合作”。第十七款规定：双方司令官须与中立国监察委员会积极合作，“以求得对本停战协定全部规定的文字与精神的遵守”。
