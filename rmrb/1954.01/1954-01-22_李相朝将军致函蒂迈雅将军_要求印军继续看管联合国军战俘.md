    李相朝将军致函蒂迈雅将军
    要求印军继续看管联合国军战俘
    【新华社开城二十一日电】朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表李相朝将军在十九日写信给中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军，要求印度看管部队继续执行看管松谷里战俘的任务。这封信的全文如下：“中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军：
    根据朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅与中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在一九五四年一月十九日致你的信件中所申述的主张，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面不准备在一月二十日九时接收现在松谷里印度部队看管下的联合国军战俘。
    我要求印度看管部队继续执行其对上述战俘的看管。在继续看管期间，我方将继续按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，继续负责维持并保证松谷里战俘营周围区域的治安和秩序，并防止和控制任何对战俘看管地点的扰乱和侵犯，继续负责对印度看管部队与在其看管下的战俘提供后勤支援。
    我等待你的答复。
        朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表
                    朝鲜人民军中将李相朝
                    一九五四年一月十九日”
