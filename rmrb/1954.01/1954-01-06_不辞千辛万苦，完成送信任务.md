	“Another Older Brother Reborn!”
	Su Jianqun, director of the Longchuan Postal Agency in Baise, Guangxi, received a trial delivery letter from the Baise Bureau in June of last year. The envelope was addressed to Yang Dechang, Guoqing Cave, Sandu, Longzhuan, Guangxi Province, and also noted that Yang Chiguang of Bo Ye Xu could accept it on his behalf. This letter was initially sent to the Baise Post Office. The bureau couldn't find such a place name on the map, so they guessed that "Longzhuan" might be a misspelling of "Longling"; "Longling" sounds the same as "Longlin", so they transferred the letter to the Longlin County Post Office. The Longlin Bureau searched everywhere but couldn't find it and returned it to the Baise Bureau. The Baise Bureau then forwarded it to the Longchuan Postal Agency for a trial delivery. When Su Jianqun received it, he inquired everywhere about the place mentioned in the letter, but no one knew. Later, he thought that maybe it was an old place name and that the sender had been away from home for many years and didn't know that the name of his hometown had changed. So he went to find Teng Fachang, an old man in his seventies. The old man said that Sandu belonged to Baise County before 1935, then was placed under the jurisdiction of Wangang County. After liberation, Wangang County was abolished, and it was again under the jurisdiction of Donglan County. Bo Ye Xu was originally the Right Jiang Revolutionary Base Area. The old man clearly explained what the place mentioned in the letter is called now. This place was more than 100 miles away from Longchuan, so Su Jianqun decided to find a reliable villager among the farmers going to the Longchuan fair to take the letter there. On June 7, he found an old villager named Huang Bumeng from Jiazhaun Township, Seventh District of Fengshan, and entrusted him to take the letter. The recipient, Yang Dechang, lived in Qinlan Township, Xishan District, Donglan County. His brother, Yang Shichang, had gone north with the Red Army in 1929 and hadn't been heard from for many years. Everyone thought he had sacrificed, and the government took care of his family as dependents of a revolutionary martyr. Yang Shichang had been away from home for many years and didn't know anything about the changes in the name of his hometown, so he still sent the letter using the old place name. Yang Dechang received the letter he had been longing for for twenty-four years on June 13. He was overjoyed and thought that “another older brother had been reborn.” Yang Dechang wrote a letter thanking Su Jianqun, saying, "If it weren't for the high sense of responsibility of cadres educated by Chairman Mao to serve the people, my brother and I would not be able to communicate in this lifetime."

	“Our Old Cui”
	Cui Junchen is a rural postman in Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province. He has been working as a rural postman since 1950 and has always been responsible for the delivery work in the Wujimi area. This rural postal route is seventy miles long, with high mountains of six or seven miles and a grassy mudflat of fifteen miles. Few people usually travel this road, but he always insists on going to work. When there is a flood, he ties the mail and newspapers around his neck and wades through the water with two sticks. When the wooden planks on the bridge are washed away by the water, leaving only wooden supports, he uses the sticks to find places in the water where his feet can stand on the wooden supports and tries to cross step by step. Every time he goes to a village, he takes the time to read the newspaper to the villagers, and also sings drum songs, fast clapper talks, and lotus ballads from the newspaper, and introduces books and publications to the masses in conjunction with various movements. In the evening, he stays in the village and helps the military dependents and the village government with their work, and writes letters for the masses. He often attends village meetings at night, where he tells the masses about the newspaper and current events. If the villagers have anything they don't understand, he always explains patiently. If he doesn't know, he goes back to the bureau to ask and then tells the villagers after he understands. He often reports his work to the district committee and reflects any problems in the village's production to the district committee. He always actively publicizes any central work arranged by the district. In the rural mutual aid groups, he organized many reading groups, which effectively promoted the work of various villages. Some members of the reading groups were also rated as high-yield models. They said, "This is all thanks to Old Cui helping us with the reading group!" Cui Junchen's conscientious and responsible service attitude has been welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. When farmers mention him, they always call him "Our Old Cui."

	Female Postal Carrier on the Tibetan Plateau
	On the Tibetan Plateau, the section from Jiali to Tai Zhao is the most difficult section of the route into Tibet. There are two mountains, Chula and Mendala, which are covered with snow all year round. The climate is very harsh, and there are only two places to live along the way, and the rest is uninhabited. Female postal carrier Rong Jin is responsible for the postal transportation work on this section of the road. She has to carry at least fifty or sixty catties of mail and walk seventy or eighty miles every day. In the summer rainy season, the rivers are crisscrossed and there are few bridges, so she must wade across the rivers. Sometimes the water is up to her abdomen, but she has never missed a shift and always arrives at her destination one day earlier than the scheduled time. Although she wades through the water, climbs mountains, and sleeps in the wilderness, she always tries her best to protect the mail. In the rainy season, she doesn't have rain or waterproof equipment, so she uses her yak hair clothes to cover the mail, so the mail she carries has never been wet by the water.

	Miao Youth Postal Carrier Wang Huizhou
	Wang Huizhou, a postal carrier from the Duyun Bureau in Guizhou, is a Miao youth who has always been active, conscientious, and responsible in his work. On September 6 last year, he picked up 271.1 kilograms of mail to deliver to Delu. Originally, after delivering the mail to Delu, he could rest, and the Danzhai Post and Telecommunications Bureau would send other comrades to take over. But at that time, dark clouds were gathering, and it was windy and rainy. It was already about 4:00 p.m. He considered that the rain would not stop in a short time. If the comrades waited for the rain to lessen before leaving, it would not only affect the people of Danzhai from reading letters and newspapers, but also delay the postal delivery along the way. Therefore, he did not hesitate to give up his rest, coordinated rainproof oilcloth with other comrades, tied the mailbags containing important documents tightly, and borrowed several thick bamboo hats from the farmer brothers to match on the mailbags. After arranging everything, he took the lead in carrying the mail and marched ahead, which inspired the comrades' enthusiasm for work. They filed forward in the heavy rain, stepping on the muddy water, and advancing on the steep slopes. After arriving at the Danzhai Bureau, the first thing he did was to open the mailbag to see if the newspapers, magazines, and letters were wet. When he saw that everything was fine, he smiled happily, completely forgetting that he was soaked all over.

	“Living Post Office”
	A large factory for manufacturing textile machines was established in Yuci, Shanxi. The scale of this factory is very large, and the number of construction workers alone was as high as 8,000 at most. The construction site is changing day by day, and the workers' demands for sending letters, remitting money, and reading newspapers are very urgent. Zhang Daozhong, a postman from the Yuci Post and Telecommunications Bureau, learned about this and suggested to his superiors to change the delivery of newspapers and letters to the construction site from once every other day to once a day. He automatically requested to add an extra shift every afternoon to deliver to the construction site. In order to solve the difficulties of workers in sending letters, remitting money, and subscribing to newspapers, Zhang Daozhong contacted the construction site union and installed many mailboxes at various locations on the construction site. He himself handled remittances and newspaper subscriptions for the workers, which greatly reduced the time workers had to take off to go to the city. He handled a lot of letters and remittances, but he never made any mistakes. In order to save time, he worked out the delivery order for each construction site according to the nearest route. Regardless of the wind or rain, he went to deliver on time. In order to enable the workers to see the letters and newspapers earlier, he changed the delivery from once a day to twice a day. He always smiled and agreed to the workers' requests: "Okay, okay!" He would rather work overtime himself at night than disappoint the workers. Therefore, he became a close friend of the workers. The workers said: "Zhang Daozhong is like a small post office!" and gave him the nickname "Living Post Office."

	“The Money Arrives Home Without Moving Your Legs!”
	Yang Kaixian, a rural postman from the Majiang Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Guizhou, delivered a registered letter containing a 500,000 yuan money order to Jin Deqing, a military dependent, on June 20 last year. Jin Deqing said happily after reading it: "I will go to the city tomorrow to get the money." Yang Kaixian immediately said after hearing this: "You are busy with production, so you don't have to bother to run around. Please stamp the money order and give it to me, and I will cash it for you and send it to you the day after tomorrow, okay?" Jin Deqing was very happy to hear this and immediately said: "I don't understand the procedures, and it will take two days to go back and forth to the city. It's really great that you can cash it for me!" Two days later, Yang Kaixian indeed delivered the remittance to Jin Deqing in full on time. Jin Deqing said happily: "The money arrives home without moving our legs! You really care about us and love us!" In addition to cashing remittances for the villagers, Yang Kaixian also often writes letters for the villagers. When the villagers see him coming, they all say: "The people's servant is here!"

    不辞千辛万苦，完成送信任务
      “再生了一个哥哥！”
    广西百色龙川邮政代办所主任苏建群，在去年六月里接到百色局转来一封试投的信，信封上写着广西省龙篆三都国庆洞杨德昌收，又注明波爷圩杨炽光代收亦可。这封信最初寄到百色邮局，该局见地图上没这么个地名，就猜想可能是把“龙菱”误写成“龙篆”；“龙菱”与“隆林”同音，于是就把信批转到隆林县邮局，隆林局找来找去找不到，无法投递，又退回百色局。百色局于是转到龙川邮政代办所试投。苏建群接到了，就到处打听信上写的地方，但问来问去没有一个人知道。后来他想，也许这是个老地名，写信的人离家多年，家乡的名称改了，他不知道。于是他去找七十多岁的老人滕发昌。这位老人说，三都在一九三五年前属百色县，后拨万冈县管，解放后万冈县撤销，又归东兰县管，波爷圩原为右江革命根据地，老人把信上写的地方现叫什么说了个一清二楚。这地方离龙川还有一百多里，苏建群决定在赶龙川圩的农民中找个可靠的人把信捎去，六月七日他找到了凤山七区甲篆乡一个叫黄卜孟的老乡，托他把信带去。收信人杨德昌住在东兰县西山区勤兰乡。他的哥哥杨世昌在一九二九年随红军北上，多年没消息，大家都以为他牺牲了，政府也按烈属待遇照顾他的家属。杨世昌出门多年，对家乡名称的更改一点也不知道，所以仍按老地名寄信。杨德昌六月十三日收到了渴望了二十四年的信，真是喜出望外，认为“再生了一个哥哥”。杨德昌写信感谢苏建群说：“要不是毛主席教养下的干部有这样为人民服务的高度责任心，我们兄弟今世是无法通音讯了。”
      “咱们老崔”
    崔俊忱是松江省尚志县的乡邮员。他从一九五○年参加乡邮工作以来，一直担任着乌吉密区投递工作。这一段乡邮线，共七十里长，途中有长达六、七里的高山，还有十五里长的草泥塘。这条路，平常很少有人行走，但他却始终坚持上班。碰到涨大水的时候，他就把邮件和报纸捆在脖子上，拄着两根棍子渡水。桥上的木板被水冲走，只剩木柁，他就用棍子在水中找木柁能放脚的地方，一步步试着过去。他每到一个村屯，有时间就给老乡读报，还照着报上的大鼓、快板、莲花落给大家唱，并结合各种运动给群众介绍书刊。晚间，他住在村屯里，帮助军属和村政府干活，替群众写信。村里夜间开会，他经常参加，在会上他给群众讲报讲时事。老乡有不明白的事问他，他总是耐心地解释，不知道的回局去问，弄明白后，再告诉老乡。他经常向区委汇报工作，看到村里生产上存在什么问题，也反映给区委；区里布置什么中心工作，他总是积极宣传。在农村互助组里，他组织了不少的读报组，有力地推动了各村工作。有的读报组的组员还被评为丰产模范，他们说：“这都是老崔帮我们搞读报组的好处！”崔俊忱认真负责的服务态度，受到了广大农民的欢迎，农民提到他，总是用“咱们老崔”这样称呼他。
    女邮运员在康藏高原上
    在康藏高原上，从嘉黎到太昭一段路程，是入藏路程中最艰难的一段。那里有出拉、门达拉两座大山，终年积雪，气候非常恶劣，沿途只有两处地方有人居住，此外都荒无人烟。女邮运员荣今，担任着这段路的邮运工作，她每天至少要背着五、六十斤的邮件走七八十里路，夏天雨季河流纵横，桥梁又少，必须涉水过河，有时水深至腹，她也从没误过班期，总是比规定时间早一天到达目的地。她虽然涉水爬山，露宿荒野，但她总想尽办法，保护邮件，在雨季里没防雨防水工具，她就把自己的牛毛衣服用来包遮邮件，因此她运的邮件没有一次被水浸湿过。
    苗族青年邮运员王惠洲
    贵州都匀局邮运员王惠洲，是个苗族青年，工作一向积极，认真负责。去年九月六日，他领班挑了二七一点一公斤邮件到得禄讯。本来到得禄讯交点了邮件，他可以休息，由丹寨邮电局派别的同志接力担运。但那时乌云密布，风一阵雨一阵，时间已是下午四点钟左右，他考虑到短时间里雨不会停，如果让同志们雨小点再走，不独影响丹寨人民看信看报，沿路邮运也要延迟。因此，他毫不犹豫地放弃休息，与其他同志调配防雨油布，将封有重要文件的邮袋捆扎结实，又向农民弟兄借几顶厚实斗笠配搭在邮袋上，布置停当，他挑着邮件带头当先，这样激发了同志们的工作热情，鱼贯地冒着大雨，踏着泥水，在高陡坡上前进。到达丹寨局后，他第一件事就是打开邮包，看报纸、杂志、信件有没有打湿，当他看见一切都好，他愉快地笑了，他完全忘掉自己全身已被打湿。
    “活邮亭”
    山西榆次建立了一个制造纺织机器的大工厂。这个工厂的规模非常大，仅建筑工人最多时就有八千。工地上一天天改变着面貌，工人们对寄信、汇款、看报的要求非常迫切。榆次邮电局的邮递员张道中知道了，就向领导上提出把隔日才给工地送一次报刊和信件改为每天送一次，他自动要求每天下午加一班给工地送。为了解决工人们发信、汇款、订报的困难，张道中和工地工会联系后，在工地各地点装设了许多信箱，他自己为工人代办汇款和订报，这样就大大减少了工人请假去城里的时间，他代办的信件、汇款非常多，但从来没有出过差错。为了节省时间，他把各工地按照最近的路线拟定了投递的顺序，不论刮风下雨，他都准时去送，为了使工人们更早地看到信件和报纸，他把一天送一次改为一天送两次，工人对他提出的要求，他总是笑嘻嘻地答应：“好，好！”他宁可晚上自己加班，也不愿叫工人失望。因此，他成了工人亲密的朋友。工人说：“张道中像个小邮局！”并且给他起了个绰号叫“活邮亭”。
      “腿不动钱就到家了！”
    贵州麻江邮电局乡邮员杨开贤，去年六月二十日交给军属金德清一封装有五十万元汇票的挂号信。金德清看了高兴地说：“我明天就到城里去取钱。”杨开贤听了马上说：“你生产忙，不必麻烦多跑路了，请你在汇票上盖个章交给我，后天我给你兑了送来好不好？”金德清一听高兴得很，立刻说：“我又不懂手续，到城里来往要耽搁两天，你给我兑，真是太好了！”过了两天，杨开贤果然准时如数地把汇款送给了金德清。金德清高兴地说： “我们腿不动钱就到家了！你们真关心我们，爱护我们！”除了代老乡兑汇款外，杨开贤还经常代老乡写信。老乡一见他来了，都说：“人民的勤务员来了！”
