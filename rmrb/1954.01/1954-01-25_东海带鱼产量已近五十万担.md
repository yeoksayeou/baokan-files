East China Sea Ribbonfish Production Nears 500,000 Dan
East China Sea ribbonfish production has reached nearly 500,000 dan. Fishermen are making final efforts to catch fish, and a bumper harvest is expected for the entire fishing season.

Ribbonfish is one of the four major fish products of the Zhoushan Islands and is known for its delicious taste. A large quantity of ribbonfish caught during the peak season has been transported by relevant transportation and sales departments to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangdong, Fujian, North China, and other places to meet the needs of the people. The first and second waves of ribbonfish production this year were successful, with a total catch of more than 300,000 dan. During the third wave, the weather changed, and there were major storms at sea. The Zhoushan Party and government leading organs and more than 500 cadres leading fishermen to sea actively organized the fishermen to engage in decentralized production. Each pair of fishing boats could still catch about 1,000 jin of ribbonfish per day, and some could catch as much as 2,000 jin. Now that the ribbonfish season is nearing its end, coastal fishermen will begin to summarize their winter production experiences and prepare for the spring fishing season. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东海带鱼产量已近五十万担
    东海带鱼产量已近五十万担，渔民正最后努力捕鱼，全汛鱼产可望丰收。
    带鱼是舟山群岛四大鱼产之一，鱼味鲜美。旺汛中捕获的大量带鱼，已由有关运销部门运到上海、杭州和广东、福建、华北等地，供应人民需要。今年第一风和第二风带鱼生产丰收，两风共捕带鱼三十多万担。第三风气候变化，海上风暴较大，舟山党政领导机关和五百多带领渔民出海的干部便积极组织渔民分散生产，每对渔船每日仍可捕带鱼千斤左右，好的可捕两千斤。现在带鱼汛将近结束，沿海渔民将开始总结冬季生产经验并准备春汛生产。　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
