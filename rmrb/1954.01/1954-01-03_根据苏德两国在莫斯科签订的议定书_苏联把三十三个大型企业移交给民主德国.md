    根据苏德两国在莫斯科签订的议定书
    苏联把三十三个大型企业移交给民主德国
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：根据一九五三年八月二十二日在莫斯科签订的关于停止收取德国赔偿费和关于减轻德意志民主共和国由于战争的后果而担负的财政与经济义务的议定书，苏联自一九五四年一月一日起，无代价地将在德国境内的机器制造、化学、冶金和其他企业共三十三个移交给德意志民主共和国，这些企业是过去由苏联接受作为赔偿的。关于移交上述各企业的各项文件已于一九五三年十二月三十一日由苏德双方全权代表签字。在交接各该企业时双方指出，这些企业在苏联管理的期间内，获得了苏联的巨额的投资。企业安装了现代化的装备，组织了许多新型产品的生产，其中包括大型轧钢设备、大型水泥工厂设备、冶金工业用的起重机和许多新型压力机的生产。大部分上述设备的生产是按苏联的设计图进行的。在苏联专家的参加下，生产的技术过程改良了。因此，被移交的各企业的生产力和总的技术水平大大提高了。所有的企业都是在生产中移交给德意志民主共和国的，它们都是有赢利的企业，它们都有订货，都有储备的原料和材料，都有必需的周转资金，这一切为这些企业今后的正常不停的工作创造了条件。
