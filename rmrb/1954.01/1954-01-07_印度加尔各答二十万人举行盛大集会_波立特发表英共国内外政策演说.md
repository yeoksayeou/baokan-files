    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 6th – Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, delivered a speech to a gathering of 200,000 people in Calcutta, India, on December 20, 1953.

    Pollitt began by summarizing the major world events of 1953, saying: "First, the international tensions have eased somewhat, which is of great significance. This situation has arisen mainly due to the strength of the world peace movement, the peace policies of the Soviet Union and People's China, and the contributions made by India in the struggle for peace. The second significant event is the armistice in Korea. ... The Korean peace agreement is a victory for the people of North Korea and a defeat for the American policy of aggression. The determination and national unity of the Korean people have proven to be invincible. Third, widespread distrust and suspicion of American policy is evident throughout the world. The United States has sent its Vice President, Secretary of State, and McCarthyites on travels. After their travels, they have had to report that they cannot find anyone in Europe or Asia who believes that the United States desires peace. This is of great significance. And it is even more significant that the three countries that the United States relies on most to act as cannon fodder in the event of a third world war—France, Britain, and Italy—harbor the greatest fears and distrust of American policy. I hope that we British, as well as the French and Italians, will learn the lesson from the American government, and that the general people of Pakistan will soon learn it as well. The lesson is that the American government does not give dollars, armaments, or advice to anyone without considering its own interests..."

    Pollitt mentioned another meaningful event of 1953: many economists believe that the American economy will experience a panic in 1954.

    Pollitt pointed out that to ensure profits, American monopoly capital would not hesitate to repeat the Korean incident elsewhere in the world. The basic political task for all democratic countries, democracy-loving people, and all those who yearn for social progress in 1954 is to further strengthen the mass movement for peace and national independence, so that it will be impossible for any country to threaten world peace.

    Pollitt then presented the British Communist Party's policy on domestic and international affairs, saying: First, it will make every effort to reduce the current heavy rearmament program. He pointed out that rearmament deprives Britain's basic industries of raw materials and manpower. The United States is using this policy to weaken the British economy and make Britain more politically subservient to the United States. He refuted the arguments in favor of rearmament. He said: "Peace is the greatest guarantee of defending peace. Every country in the world has no need to fear the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China." Second, demanding a ban on all types of atomic and bacteriological warfare. Pollitt said: "Before satisfactory negotiations on the peaceful uses of atomic energy can begin, the people of the world, in their own right, want to hear that every atomic and hydrogen bomb has been destroyed." Third, the British Communist Party demands that Britain should take the initiative to ask the United States, France, China, and the Soviet Union to sign a peace pact. If such a peace pact can be signed, there is a possibility of establishing lasting peace. The British Communist Party believes that there are no international problems that cannot be resolved through negotiation. Fourth, demanding the withdrawal of British troops in Egypt, British Guiana, Africa, Korea, and Malaya. He said: "The colonial countries have awakened, and they are fighting with great force to break free from the shackles of imperialism and strive for independence. There is no force in the world that can destroy them." Fifth, the British Communist Party also demands that the United States reduce tariffs and that Britain has the right to trade with any place in the world. Pollitt pointed out that the United States does not allow British merchants to export as many as 1,125 important commodities to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. He said: In the extraordinary evolution of the international situation, the British people are rapidly becoming slaves to the United States. The British Communists demand that every American soldier return to his own home.

    印度加尔各答二十万人举行盛大集会
    波立特发表英共国内外政策演说
   【新华社新德里六日电】英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特，在一九五三年十二月二十日在印度的加尔各答城向一个二十万人的集会发表演说。
    波立特首先综述了一九五三年的世界大事说：“第一，国际紧张局势多少已有些缓和，这一点是有重大意义的。这种情况得以产生，主要是由于世界和平运动的强大、苏联和人民中国的和平政策以及印度为争取和平所作的贡献。第二件具有重大意义的事情，就是朝鲜的停战。……朝鲜和平协议是北朝鲜人民的胜利和美国侵略政策的失败。朝鲜人民的决心和民族团结，已证明是不可战胜的。第三，全世界已普遍对美国政策表示不信任和怀疑。美国曾派遣了它的副总统、国务卿以及麦卡锡分子出来旅行。而他们在旅行后都不得不提出报告说，他们不论在欧洲或亚洲，都不能发现有任何人相信美国希望和平。这一点具有重大意义。而美国在万一发生第三次世界大战时所最依赖它们充当炮灰的法国、英国、意大利这三个国家，对美国政策的疑惧和不信任最为厉害，这一点更有着重大的意义。我希望我们英国人以及法国人和意大利人从美国政府得到的教训，巴基斯坦的一般人民很快的也能得到。这个教训就是：美国政府并不是不为自己利益而把美元、军备或建议给予任何人的。……”
    波立特提到一九五三年另一有意义的事件，就是：许多经济学家都认为，美国经济将在一九五四年中发生恐慌。
    波立特指出：为了保证利润，美国垄断资本是会毫不犹豫地在世界其他地点重演朝鲜事件的。各民主国家、爱好民主的人民、一切渴望社会进步的人们在一九五四年基本的政治任务就是：更进一步加强争取和平与民族独立的群众运动，这样，任何国家想要威胁世界和平就不可能了。
    波立特接着提出了英国共产党关于国内外形势的政策，他说：第一，将竭尽一切努力争取削减现行重整军备计划。他指出，重整军备剥夺了英国基本工业的原料和人力。美国正利用这种政策来削弱英国的经济，使英国在政治上更加顺从美国。他驳斥了赞成重整军备的论调。他说：“和平才是保卫和平的最大保证。世界上每一个国家都无须对苏联和中华人民共和国有所恐惧。”第二，要求禁止一切类型的原子与细菌战争。波立特说：“在讨论把原子能作为和平用途的令人满意的谈判开始以前，世界各国人民根据自身权利希望听到：每一枚原子—氢弹都已销毁。”第三，英国共产党要求英国应主动要求美国、法国、中国和苏联签订和平公约。如果能签订这种和平公约，就有建立持久和平的可能。英国共产党相信没有不可经由谈判来解决的国际问题。第四，要求撤退英国在埃及、英属圭亚那、非洲、朝鲜和马来亚的英国部队。他说：“殖民地国家觉醒了，它们以巨大的力量争取摆脱帝国主义的枷锁，争取独立。世界上是没有任何力量可以摧毁它们的。”第五，英国共产党也要求美国减低关税，要求英国跟全世界任何地方进行贸易的权利。波立特指出，美国不容许英国商人向苏联及人民民主国家输出的重要商品达一千一百二十五种之多。他说：在国际形势异乎寻常的演变中，英国人民很快成了美国的奴隶。英国共产党人要求每一个美国兵都回到他自己家里去。
