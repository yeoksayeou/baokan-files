Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: According to a report by TASS, Moscow, in "Pravda" on the 15th: Party organizations of various districts of Moscow of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held representative meetings. G.M. Malenkov, N.S. Khrushchev, P.K. Ponomarenko, P.N. Pospelov and N.N. Shatalin participated in the Red Guard District Party Representative Meeting. V.M. Molotov and N.A. Bulganin participated in the Kiev District Party Representative Meeting. K.Y. Voroshilov participated in the Lenin District Meeting, L.M. Kaganovich participated in the Kirov District meeting, and A.I. Mikoyan and M.G. Pervukhin participated in the Molotov District meeting.

"Pravda" pointed out: The district party representative meetings were conducted at a high level of political and ideological awareness, and with widespread criticism and self-criticism. The party representative meetings demonstrated the growing enthusiasm and initiative of the Communist Party members, and their determination to contribute all their strength to realize the instructions of the Party and the government and to consolidate the powerful socialist country. When discussing the summary reports of the work of the district party committees, the representatives paid special attention to the basic tasks of economic and cultural construction. They discussed these tasks in detail: how to make the most of the existing potential in various enterprises to increase the output of each square meter of production space and improve product quality. The meetings also paid close attention to the problems of assisting the countryside, collective farms, and machine tractor stations. The representatives attending the Kirov District Party Representative Meeting pointed out that the party organizations of most enterprises and institutions maintained close ties with the collective farms and machine tractor stations in the suburbs of Moscow. They provided practical assistance to the collective farms in repairing tools, economic buildings, and building greenhouses. The representative meeting instructed the district's party organizations to spare no effort to victoriously implement the resolution of the September 1953 plenary session of the Party Central Committee. "Pravda" finally emphasized that the Moscow District Party Representative Meetings clearly showed that Moscow's Communist Party members are closely united around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government.
