　　Educating Farmers to Avoid Waste During the Spring Festival
　　——Summary of Readers' Letters
    Recently, many readers have written to suggest that during the Spring Festival, attention should be paid to educating farmers to use their surplus money and grain to prepare for increased agricultural production.
    Due to the influence of feudal superstitious habits, some farmers often invite Bodhisattvas, buy incense, candles, and paper money, and prepare wine and dishes to worship gods and ancestors during the Spring Festival. Especially this year, after farmers sold their grain to the state, they have surplus money. Publicizing the principles of thrift to farmers and preventing serious waste is beneficial to increasing production and practicing economy, as well as to the farmers' own production and lives.
    Currently, some places have adopted positive measures out of concern for the lives of the masses and have paid attention to publicity work, avoiding the occurrence of waste. For example, reader Li Jian reflected: "In Xuchang County, Henan Province, it was discovered that some farmers were going to Xiaomin Town, more than ten or twenty miles away, to buy paper for burning. Local district and township cadres, in order to prevent extravagance and waste, decided that during the Spring Festival, Party and Youth League members should take the lead in mobilizing family and friends to not burn paper or incense, not gamble, and not eat and drink excessively." Reader Wang Jiake reflected: "Wang Jiaquan of Pinglin Village, Fuxing Township, Zhaohua County, Sichuan Province, originally only planned to sell 100 jin of grain. Later, after education on the General Line, he raised his awareness and decided to save unnecessary expenses, selling the grain originally intended for 'inviting gods' for funerals and burning incense and buying paper to the state, and depositing the money in the state bank. When Pu Kaijin of Lijia Village was building a house, he originally planned to hold a large banquet to 'bring glory to the family,' but now he has also decided not to do so, and sell the saved two dan of grain to the state."
    The above shows that as long as we care about the lives of the masses, take the initiative to educate and help farmers, and explain the reasons why they should not be superstitious and wasteful, farmers will consciously overcome backward habits.
    It is worth noting that some places have not paid enough attention to educating farmers, and waste has already occurred. Reader Zhang Yingchao of the Northeast Region Taxation Bureau pointed out in a letter that four private wholesalers selling superstitious items in Harbin City had sales of incense and paper amounting to as much as 3.2 billion yuan from January to September of last year. The purchase price of each board of incense was only 11,000 yuan, but it was sold to farmers for more than 20,000 yuan. At present, many private merchants from various counties are going to Harbin City to purchase superstitious items. The private "Wansheng Yi" store sold more than 17,000 boards of incense in less than a day, with a gross profit of more than 10 million yuan.
    Farmers' feudal superstitious activities during the Spring Festival are a habit left over from history, and this habit can only be gradually overcome with the improvement of people's economic lives and the increase of political awareness. Therefore, it is unrealistic and impossible to eliminate this influence in a very short period of time. However, it is also wrong to abandon actively carrying out propaganda and education work among the broad masses of farmers and not daring to educate and persuade the masses to reduce unnecessary expenses.
    In addition, it must also be noted that it is completely appropriate for the broad masses of farmers to appropriately improve their lives or participate in some mass New Year activities during the Spring Festival on the basis of increasing production. When we advocate thrift, we must never allow farmers to have the mistaken impression that necessary expenses are considered unnecessary waste.

　　教育农民在春节期间不要浪费
　　——读者来信综述
    最近有不少读者来信提出：在春节前后要注意教育农民把余款、余粮用到准备农业增产上去。
    由于封建迷信习惯的影响，每逢过年过节有些农民多要请菩萨，买香烛、纸箔，备酒菜敬神佛、祭祖先等。特别是今年农民把粮食卖给国家后都有余款，向农民宣传节约道理，防止发生严重的浪费现象，这对增产节约及农民自己的生产、生活都是有好处的。
    目前，某些地方由于关心群众生活，采取了积极的作法，注意了宣传工作，避免了浪费现象的发生。如读者李健反映：“河南许昌县发现有些农民由一二十里路以外到小民镇买烧纸，当地区乡干部为了防止铺张浪费，就决定在春节期间，由党、团员带头动员家庭亲友，不烧纸烧香，不赌博，不大吃大喝。”读者王家科反映：“四川省昭化县福星乡坪林村王家全原来只准备卖一百斤粮食，后来经过总路线的教育，提高了认识，决定节约不必要的花费，把原来准备用来‘请神’办丧，烧香买纸的粮食卖给国家，把粮款存入国家银行。李家村蒲开金盖房子时原准备大设酒席来‘光耀门庭’，现在也决定不办，把省下的两石谷子再卖给国家。”
    以上说明了只要我们关心群众生活，采取主动教育和帮助农民，讲清不应迷信浪费的道理，农民会自觉地克服落后习惯的。
    值得注意的：有些地方对教育农民注意不够，已经发生了浪费现象。东北区税务管理局读者张英超来信指出，哈尔滨市四家卖迷信品的批发私商，在去年一月至九月，香、纸的销货额即达三十二亿元之多。每封板香进价只一万一千余元，卖给农民就要两万多元。目前从各县到哈尔滨市购迷信品的私商很多。私营“万生仪”商号不到一天就卖了板香一万七千多封，毛利达一千多万元。
    农民在春节期间的封建迷信活动，是历史上遗留下来的一种习惯，这种习惯，只有随着人民经济生活的改善和政治觉悟的提高才能逐步加以克服。因而要想在极短的时间内清除这种影响是不切合实际的，也是不可能的。但是，如果放弃了积极地向广大农民进行宣传教育工作，不敢教育和劝说群众减少不必要的开支，也是不对的。
    另外还必须注意：广大农民群众在增加生产的基础上，趁着春节期间适当地改善生活或参加一些群众性的年节活动是完全应该的。我们在提倡节约时绝不可使农民产生另外的错觉：把必要的开支当作无谓的浪费。
