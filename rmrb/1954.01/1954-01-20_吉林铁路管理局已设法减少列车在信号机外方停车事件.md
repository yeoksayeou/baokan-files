    Jilin Railway Administration Has Taken Measures to Reduce
    Incidents of Trains Stopping Outside Signals
    A letter from the Traffic Department of the Jilin Railway Administration: The readers' criticism of our administration for having too many instances of trains stopping outside signals in the "Reader's Letters Digest" column of the People's Daily on November 12, 1953, is correct. In November 1952, when we launched the 500-kilometer full-load and over-axle campaign, our administration issued instructions to the field "regarding reducing stops outside signals, strengthening analysis, and reporting at each level," which greatly reduced the number of stops outside signals for a time. However, because we did not focus closely enough on this work, the achievements were not consolidated, and the established system gradually became a formality. This shows that we did not attach enough importance to this issue. To correct the above shortcomings, we have formulated specific regulations for "reducing stops outside signals" and will soon instruct all sub-bureaus and relevant personnel to thoroughly implement them. In addition, we are making this issue a key point in our daily inspection of charts to draw attention to it at all times.

### 吉林铁路管理局已设法减少列车在信号机外方停车事件

    吉林铁路管理局已设法减少
    列车在信号机外方停车事件
    吉林铁路管理局车务处来信：一九五三年十一月十二日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏中，读者对我局在信号机外方停车过多的批评是正确的。在一九五二年十一月份开展满载超轴五百公里运动时，我局曾向现场发出“关于减少在信号机外方停车，加强分析，按级上报”的指示，一度使在信号机外方停车事件大为减少。但由于我们对这项工作抓得不紧，成绩未能巩固，致使所订的制度逐渐流于形式。这说明我们对这个问题的重视还是不够的。为了纠正上述缺点，我们已经拟定了“减少信号机外方停车”的具体条例，即将指示各分局及有关人员彻底执行。此外，我们在每天检查图表时把这个问题作为重点工作，以随时引起注意。
