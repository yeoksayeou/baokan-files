　　Quzhai Village Agricultural Cooperative Writes to North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
　　Determined to Strive for Further Production Increase This Year

To all worker comrades of North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory:

　　After studying the general line for the transition period, we have come to understand the significance of the country's socialist industrialization and its close connection to agricultural production and the lives of farmers; in particular, we feel even closer to our worker elder brothers in thought and feeling.

　　Our Quzhai Village is a village of semi-mountainous and semi-sloping land with infertile soil. Since we responded to Chairman Mao's call and organized ourselves, production has increased year by year. In 1953, our agricultural production cooperative, consisting of 102 households, achieved a bumper harvest, with a total of 241,615 jin of original grain from 659 mu of autumn land, an average of 366 jin (or 2 shi, 6 dou, and 2 sheng) per mu, exceeding the normal yield by 33 percent; the income of cooperative members also increased. As a result, the members were all smiles and everyone was satisfied, and some who were originally unstable in their thinking are now willing to actively run the cooperative well; the farmers outside the cooperative have also been greatly encouraged, and 42 households have already requested to join the cooperative.

　　Before studying the general line, although we had already been on the road of socialist transformation of agriculture for four years, many people's minds were not clear, and they did not regard running the cooperative well as a bright path to socialism. Now the general line has illuminated our path forward, allowing us to see a happy and fulfilling future, and further strengthening our determination to move towards socialism. While studying the general line, we deeply recognized the consistency of national interests and individual interests through accounting, and recognized the benefits of industrial development for agricultural production. The whole cooperative now has a total of six walking plows, cultivating 360 mu of land. Based on the experimental results of increasing grain production by 3 dou per mu last year, the whole cooperative increased grain production by 108 shi. The 248 mu of high-yield land in the cooperative, with an average yield of 559 jin per mu, were all due to the use of new-style walking plows and fertilizer. If it hadn't been for the help of sprayers and pesticides to eliminate pests, the 30 mu of potatoes would not have been able to increase production by 10,000 jin. With more grain harvested, plus industrial products being cheaper than in the past, every household is living a life of plenty. These are all the benefits that industrial development has brought us, so all members of the cooperative deeply feel the supporting role of the worker elder brothers in our production, and wholeheartedly support the leadership of the working class.

　　Therefore, when the People's Government called on us to sell grain to support industrial construction, everyone eagerly volunteered even before the cooperative held a meeting to discuss it. Everyone decided to sell 42,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Then, every household thrashed corn and winnowed grain overnight, striving to deliver grain as soon as possible, ensuring that the grain was not damp and free of impurities and soil. At the same time, everyone decided to invest more than 10 million yuan of grain money into agricultural production in 1954, and immediately signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to purchase one new-style walking plow and 1,000 jin of fertilizer; in addition, we will buy 32 sheep and 20 pigs. We are determined to strive for further production increase in 1954 and sell 80,000 jin of grain to the state.

　　璩寨村农业合作社写信给华北农业机械总厂
　　决心争取在今年进一步增加生产华北农业机械总厂全体工人同志们：
    学习了过渡时期的总路线后，我们认识了国家社会主义工业化的意义以及它对农业生产和农民生活的密切联系；特别觉得在思想情感上和工人老大哥更加亲近了。
    我们璩寨村是个半山半坡、土地瘠薄的村庄。自从我们响应毛主席号召，组织起来以后，生产就一年年提高。一九五三年，我们这个一百零二户的农业生产合作社获得丰收，全社六百五十九亩秋地共产原粮二十四万一千六百十五斤，每亩平均三百六十六斤（即二石六斗二升），超过常年产量百分之三十三；社员收入也增加了。因此，社员们喜笑颜开，人人满意，有些原来思想不稳定的现在都愿意积极搞好合作社；社外农民也得到了很大的鼓舞，有四十二户农民已经要求入社了。
    在学习总路线以前，我们虽说已经在农业社会主义改造的道路上走了四年，但很多人心眼不明亮，并没有把办好合作社当成走向社会主义的光明大路。现在总路线照亮了我们前进的道路，使我们看见了幸福美满的前途，进一步加强了走向社会主义的决心。在学习总路线时，我们通过算账，深刻地认识了国家利益和个人利益的一致性，认识了工业发展对农业生产的好处。全社现在共有六张步犁，耕地三百六十亩，根据去年每亩增产三斗粮的试验结果计算，全社就增产一百零八石粮。社里二百四十八亩大面积丰产地，每亩平均产五百五十九斤、都是使用了新式步犁和肥田粉的缘故。三十亩山药蛋要不是喷雾器和杀虫药剂帮助，消灭不了虫害，增产不了一万斤。粮食打多了，再加上工业品都比过去便宜，家家都过着丰衣足食的生活。这都是工业发展了给我们的好处，所以，全体社员都深深感到工人老大哥对我们生产的支援作用，从心眼里拥护工人阶级的领导。
    所以，当人民政府号召售粮支援工业建设时，没等社里开会讨论，大家就踊跃自报开了。大家决定把社里四万二千斤余粮都卖给国家。接着家家都连夜打玉米、簸晒粮食，争取及早交粮，保证粮食不潮湿，没有杂质土块。同时，大家又决定把粮款一千多万元投入一九五四年的农业生产，并即刻和供销合作社订立了合同，购买新式步犁一张、肥田粉一千斤；另外还要买羊三十二只、猪二十只。我们决心争取在一九五四年要进一步增加生产，卖给国家八万斤粮食。
