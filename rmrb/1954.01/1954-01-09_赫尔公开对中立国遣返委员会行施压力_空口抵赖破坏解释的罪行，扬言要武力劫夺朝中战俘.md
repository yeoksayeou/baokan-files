Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 8th. Special correspondent Wu Min reports: On January 3rd, Hull, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, sent a letter to the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, Timmayya, regarding the "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the attached "Individual Reports" and related documents of the Swedish and Swiss members. In his letter, Hull attempted to shamelessly deny the responsibility of the United Nations Command for undermining the "Terms of Reference" and the explanation work, and he arrogantly declared that the explanation work must no longer continue, and that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission must hand over the prisoners of war under its custody to the United Nations Command headquarters on January 23rd. Hull's letter publicly exerts pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, demanding that it agree to the US plan to forcibly detain more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

The "Interim Report" submitted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to the parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement lists many specific facts that thoroughly confirm the criminal acts of the US side in implementing a policy of espionage and terror to undermine the implementation of the Armistice Agreement. Hull, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, who is embarrassingly in the defendant's position in the face of world opinion, dares not refute any of the specific facts presented in the "Interim Report" that confirm the crimes of the United Nations Command in forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The reason for this is very simple: because the specific facts listed in the interim report are irrefutable by Hull. Hull did not comment on the "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" itself, but instead, like a drowning man trying to grab a straw to save himself, seized upon the "Individual Reports" of the Swedish and Swiss members to exonerate himself. However, the unjust nature of these reports by the Swedish and Swiss members, which deliberately conceal and obscure the activities of the United Nations Command in undermining the explanation work, is obvious to all.

Just as a murderer hides his bloody hands behind his back while saying "I didn't commit a crime," Hull said in his letter: "The United Nations Command categorically denies any suggestion that we have in any way attempted to exert even the slightest degree of control over South Camp prisoners of war by dispatching agents provocateurs, or that we have attempted to maintain any kind of intelligence network." However, what has happened in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in recent months has already exposed the bloody hands of the United Nations Command to the world. Hull's "categorical denial" now is a waste of effort. The "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" definitively points out that the "very complex and complete" espionage organization deployed by the United Nations Command among the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war controlled the entire prisoner-of-war camp. The "violent acts" of the espionage organization "were applied to those who were willing to exercise their right of repatriation," and "several murders had occurred," making it so that "not a single prisoner of war dared to openly request repatriation" in the southern prisoner-of-war camp. The "headquarters of the espionage organization was located in Seoul and controlled by the Commander-in-Chief of the Republic of Korea Military Police," and the headquarters directed the terrorist activities of the spies in each camp through an "effective communication system," while "the United Nations 64th Field Hospital constituted the most important link in this communication system." On this issue, even the reports of the Swedish and Swiss members, which Hull seized as a life-saving straw, could not save him. The report also had to admit: The "organization" in the South Camp "had very strict control over the prisoners of war who requested repatriation, so the latter often had to apply for repatriation secretly and at the risk of their lives." "Violent acts, even murders, have occurred" in South Camp.

The crucial fact that the United Nations Command used its spies to violently prevent the repatriation of prisoners of war, which no one can deny, explains why the explanation work for South Camp prisoners of war could not be carried out in accordance with the "Terms of Reference." However, Hull still attempted to shift the responsibility for the United Nations Command's sabotage of the explanation work by biting the Korean and Chinese sides in return. Hull attributed the reason for the disruption of the explanation work to the so-called "delaying tactics" of the Korean and Chinese sides, and said that the Korean and Chinese sides' requirements for explanation facilities were "unreasonable," and that the Korean and Chinese sides "refused to accept a reasonable number of prisoners of war willing to listen to the explanation every day" and "refused to make use of the available explanation time." People can see how rogue Hull is when they look at the description of the facts in the "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." The Korean and Chinese sides' requirements for explanation facilities were considered reasonable by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the United Nations Command's delay in the construction of explanation facilities was condemned by the Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The explanation plan put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" has been repeatedly obstructed and undermined by the spies of the United Nations Command. Precisely because of these facts, the Korean and Chinese sides could not obtain the ninety-day explanation period, and only conducted ten days of explanation work for a very small number of prisoners of war. The United Nations Command threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not to use force to sanction spies, which allowed the spies to let go of their sabotage of the explanation work and the murder of prisoners of war who were willing to repatriate, completely destroying the "Terms of Reference." In the face of these facts, how can Hull be allowed to confuse the public!

Obviously, whether it is empty denial or blaming others, it is absolutely impossible to deny the serious responsibility of the United Nations Command for undermining the relevant agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war and the explanation work. The purpose of this destructive behavior by the United Nations Command is to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. In his letter, Hull further proposed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission the United Nations Command's plan to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. He arbitrarily said: Regardless of how the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" have been undermined, and regardless of whether the political conference is convened, the explanation work should be terminated on December 23, 1953, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should end its custody of the prisoners of war on January 22, 1954, and hand over the prisoners of war to the United Nations Command headquarters by January 23. He said: "We cannot accept any other suggestions that any other organization...may make." Hull stated that the United Nations Command headquarters "is fully prepared to receive" the prisoners of war, and said that "they will be sent to places of their own choosing to be peacefully employed as civilians." The latter sentence is of course a deceptive cover. Hull himself has already ordered the construction of two camps for detaining prisoners of war in the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone, and the US side has already repeatedly and undisguisedly stated that it will send the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to the Li Chengwan and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder, and also plans to send some of them to the US military base on Okinawa for further espionage and military training.

People can see very clearly that Hull knows that the US side is unreasonably undermining the international agreement it signed. Therefore, he has to be arrogant and unreasonable, not making sense, and on the one hand, he said that he "does not accept any other suggestions," but on the other hand, he insisted that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission accept his unreasonable demands. His letter, as well as the US propaganda machine's matching clamor that the US would allow the Li Chengwan army to enter the Demilitarized Zone to forcibly seize prisoners of war, are all attempts to force the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to completely abandon its fair position, abandon its legal duties that it should perform according to the "Terms of Reference," so that the US plan to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war can be finally realized.

### 赫尔公开对中立国遣返委员会行施压力  空口抵赖破坏解释的罪行，扬言要武力劫夺朝中战俘

    赫尔公开对中立国遣返委员会行施压力
    空口抵赖破坏解释的罪行，扬言要武力劫夺朝中战俘
    【新华社开城八日电】　本社特派记者吴敏报道：联合国军总司令赫尔一月三日就“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”与后附的瑞典、瑞士委员的“个别报告”和有关文件，致函中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅。赫尔在信中企图空口抵赖联合国军方面破坏“职权范围”和解释工作的责任，并横蛮地宣称解释工作必须不再继续进行，中立国遣返委员会必须在一月二十三日把其看管下的战俘交给联合国军司令部。赫尔的信公开对中立国遣返委员会行使压力，要它同意美方强迫扣留二万多名朝中战俘的罪恶计划。
    中立国遣返委员会提交朝鲜停战缔约双方的
  “临时报告”，列举了许多具体事实，彻底证实了美方执行特务恐怖政策来破坏停战协定之实施的罪恶行为。在世界舆论面前狼狈地处于被告地位的联合国军总司令赫尔，对于“临时报告”所提出的证实联合国军方面强迫扣留战俘罪行的各项具体事实，一条也不敢加以辩驳。这个原因是很简单的：因为临时报告所列举的具体事实是赫尔所无法辩驳的。赫尔完全没有对“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”本身发表意见，而只是像快要淹死的人想抓住一根稻草来救自己一样，抓住瑞典、瑞士委员的“个别报告”来给自己开脱责任。然而，这个瑞典、瑞士委员的报告，其蓄意隐瞒和掩饰联合国军破坏解释工作活动的面目的不公正性质，是人所共见的。
    正好像杀人犯把他的血手藏在背后而嘴里说“没有犯罪”一样，赫尔在信中说：“联合国军司令部断然否认关于我们曾在任何方面试图用派遣特务煽动分子的办法来对南营战俘加以——最低程度的——控制的任何说法，或是我们曾试图维持任何种类情报网的说法。”然而，几个月来在朝鲜非军事区所发生的事情早已把联合国军司令部的血手揭露于世了，赫尔现在还来空口“断然否认”也是白费力气的了。“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”中确定地指出，联合国军方面在朝中战俘中布置的“甚为复杂而完整”的特务组织，控制了整个战俘营。特务组织的“暴力行为曾施用于那些愿意行使遣返权利的人”，“若干次凶杀事件曾经发生”，使南部战俘营中“没有一个战俘敢于公开要求遣返”。特务组织的“总部地点在汉城，受大韩民国宪兵总司令官的控制”，总部通过一个“有效的通讯系统”指挥各营场特务的恐怖活动，而“联合国军第六十四野战医院在这一通讯系统中构成了最重要的一环”。在这个问题上，甚至被赫尔抓住当作救命草的瑞典、瑞士委员的报告也救不了他。报告中也不得不承认：南营中存在的“组织对要求遣返的战俘控制很严，因此后者常常不得不秘密地并冒着生命危险来申请遣返”。南营中“发生过暴力行为，甚至凶杀事件”。
    联合国军方面通过其特务以暴力阻止战俘遣返，这个任何人都无法否认的关键性事实，说明了为什么对南营战俘的解释工作不能按照“职权范围”进行。然而，赫尔在信中却还企图用反咬朝中方面一口的办法，来推卸联合国军方面破坏解释工作的责任。赫尔竟把解释工作遭受破坏的原因归之于所谓朝中方面的“拖延策略”，并且说什么朝中方面关于解释设备的要求“毫无道理”，朝中方面“拒绝接受每天愿意听取解释的战俘的合理人数”，“拒绝利用可以利用的解释时间”。人们看一看“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”中关于事实的叙述，就可以知道赫尔是多么无赖了。朝中方面关于解释设备的要求被中立国遣返委员会认为是合理的，而联合国军方面拖延解释设备的修建是中立国遣返委员会临时报告所谴责的。朝中方面根据“职权范围”提出每天的解释计划，一再遭到联合国军方面特务的阻挠和破坏。正因为这些事实，朝中方面不能得到九十天的解释日期，而只能向极少数战俘进行了十天的解释工作。联合国军方面威胁中立国遣返委员会不得使用武力来制裁特务，就使得特务能够放手破坏解释工作和凶杀愿意遣返的战俘，彻底破坏“职权范围”。在这些事实面前，岂容赫尔来混淆视听！
    很显然，无论空口否认也好，嫁罪于人也好，都是绝对抵赖不掉联合国军方面破坏有关战俘遣返协议和解释工作的严重责任的。联合国军这种破坏行为的目的，就是要强迫扣留朝中战俘。赫尔在信中也进一步向中立国遣返委员会提出了联合国军方面强迫扣留朝中战俘的计划。他专断地说：不管
  “职权范围”的规定如何遭受了破坏，不管政治会议是否召开，解释工作都应在一九五三年十二月二十三日截止，中立国遣返委员会应在一九五四年一月二十二日结束对战俘的看管，到一月二十三日就要把战俘交给联合国军司令部。他说：“我们不能够接受任何其他机构……可能提出的任何其他建议。”赫尔表示联合国军司令部“已完全准备接纳”战俘，并说要把“他们送往他们自己选择的地方去作为一个平民和平地就业”。后面一句话当然是一个骗人幌子，赫尔自己就已经下令在非军事区南部建造二个扣留战俘的营场，美方也早已毫不掩饰地一再表示要把朝中战俘送交李承晚及蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰，并且还计划将其中的一部分扣送美国军事基地冲绳岛去受进一步的特务军事训练。
    人们看得很清楚，赫尔明知美国方面是毫无道理地破坏他们自己所签字的国际协议的。因此他只好横蛮霸道，不讲道理，一面表示“不接受任何其他建议”，另一方面却强要中立国遣返委员会接受他的无理主张。他的这封信以及美方宣传机器配合着发出的关于美方将允许李承晚军队进入非军事区以武力劫夺战俘的叫嚣，都是在企图迫使中立国遣返委员会完全放弃其公正立场，放弃其根据“职权范围”所应该履行的合法职务，而使美方强迫扣留朝中战俘的计划得以最后实现。
