　　Kong Taotao Learns Production Management

　　Kong Taotao is the deputy director of the mechanical workshop at the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory. He has twenty-seven years of work experience, and the workers all call him "Master Taotao."

　　Kong Taotao always relied on his old experience to lead production. Every day, dozens of drawings and hundreds of parts passed through his hands. Without any records, he knew who was doing what and when. Last year, when the factory started implementing work plans, Kong Taotao found the work plans too troublesome and was unwilling to create them. At that time, he was the foreman of the bushing section. The bushing section was a major section of the mechanical workshop, and the leadership wanted to use this section as a "pilot project." When Kong Taotao found out about this, he said to the secretary of the workshop's Party branch: "I can count these parts with my eyes closed, why bother making work plans? Who would even look at those endless forms!"

　　However, production was developing every day. In 1951, it took the Shanghai Boiler Factory two or three months to assemble a crane, but last year they had to assemble several cranes in a month. Thus, Kong Taotao's "brain wasn't enough." In April of last year, the head of the planning section came to the bushing section to check on the completion of production tasks. When he asked about several parts, Kong Taotao thought they seemed to be done, but then again, maybe they weren't. Several times, the Party Committee Secretary came to the workshop to understand the situation and asked him, "Why is it always loose at the beginning and tight at the end? Why can't the production tasks be completed?" "You're the only one assigning work, you understand it, but do others know?" Kong Taotao couldn't answer any of these questions.

　　Later, the factory discussed the national plan. Kong Taotao's concept of planning began to take root. He understood that the plan had to be implemented by everyone and that there had to be a system to organize everyone. From then on, the bushing section had work plans. After several months of trial implementation, the production situation changed. For example, in the past, if an eight-hour job was assigned, and the worker took twelve hours, the foreman wouldn't know. With work plans, if some work was advanced or delayed, it could be seen on the progress chart. The bushing section had consistently failed to complete its tasks from January to April of last year, but from May onwards, it overfulfilled the production plan every month. Seeing these achievements, Kong Taotao thought more and more that "Work plans are indeed good. Relying solely on old experience is not enough to improve production, we must learn the skills of scientific management."

　　Starting in September of last year, the bushing section trialed weekly work plans, and the production situation became even better. In the past, Kong Taotao would hand out three or four inches thick of drawings every month, and the workers would complain they couldn't handle it. After implementing weekly work plans, he handed out over a foot thick of drawings, and the workers complained there wasn't enough work. The workers said, "In the past, when the foreman assigned work, we gave verbal assurances, but we didn't really have a number in mind. With weekly work plans, even if the foreman isn't there, we can still work according to the progress chart." Some said, "With weekly work plans, the goals of the increase production and practice economy campaign are clear, production proceeds step by step, we see results every day, and we have more and more energy to work."

　　In the past, Kong Taotao's shadow couldn't be seen at the desk in the bushing section. He was like a "street runner," constantly running around the workshop every day: getting materials for this person, taking tools for that person, arguing with comrades from functional groups, and at the end of the month, he would even have to go to the machine tool himself, working overtime to rush production.

　　Now, Kong Taotao has been promoted to deputy director of the workshop and is also the leader of the scheduling group. Next to his desk, there is a workshop production progress board. With old experience plus new methods, he can see the production situation of each section and each part from the scheduling board. He is also responsible for mastering the work plans of the large parts section, which parts to make first, which parts to make later, how much time each machine tool will take – he can calculate everything clearly. In addition, every Friday, Kong Taotao also convenes production meetings for the heads of each section to resolve important issues in production.

　　Once, the secretary of the workshop Party branch jokingly asked Kong Taotao: "In the past, you managed one section, now you manage a whole workshop. What about this 'short-lived work plan'?" Kong Taotao replied with a smile: "Didn't you tell me in the past that 'the working class must learn to manage production'? In the future, I will study even harder, learn to manage a factory, manage many factories, and take on the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the Party."

　　孔桃桃学计划管理
    孔桃桃是国营上海锅炉厂机械车间副主任，他有二十七年的工龄，工人们都叫他“桃桃师傅”。
    孔桃桃一向凭老经验领导生产。每天几十张图纸、几百种零件从他手里派出去，不用记录，谁在什么时候干什么活，他心里都有数。去年厂里开始推行作业计划的时候，孔桃桃嫌作业计划太麻烦，不愿意订。那时他是轴套工段的工段长。轴套工段是机械车间的一个主要工段，领导上要拿这个工段来“试点”。孔桃桃知道了这事，就对车间党支部书记说：“这些零件我闭着眼睛也数得出，还订作业计划干什么？一张张表格，谁看得下去！”
    但是，生产在天天发展，一九五一年，上海锅炉厂两、三个月才能装起一部行车，去年一个月就要装好几部。于是孔桃桃的“脑筋不够用了”。去年四月里，计划科长到轴套工段检查生产任务完成的情况，问了好几个零件，孔桃桃想想好像是做好了，又好像没有做好。有几次，党委书记到车间来了解情况，问他：“为啥老是前松后紧，生产任务完不成呢？”“你一个人派工，自己心里明白，别人有没有数呢？”一连几个问题，孔桃桃都答不上来。
    后来，厂里讨论了国家计划。孔桃桃的计划观念才开始树立起来，他明白了：计划要靠大家来执行，并且要有一个制度把大家组织起来。从那以后，轴套工段有了作业计划，试行了几个月，生产情况变了样。如过去派出一件八小时的活，工人做了十二小时，工段长也不知道。有了作业计划，有的活赶前错后，从进度表上一看就有数了。轴套工段去年一月到四月，一向完不成任务，但从五月份起月月都超额完成了生产计划。看到这些成绩，孔桃桃越想越对：“作业计划的确是好，要搞好生产光凭老经验不行，要学会科学管理的本领。”
    去年九月份起，轴套工段试行了周作业计划，生产情况就更好了。过去孔桃桃每月派出三、四吋厚的图纸，工人都喊吃不消；实行周作业计划后，他派出了一尺多厚的图纸，工人反而嫌活少了。工人们说：“过去工段长派活，我们口头保证，心中无数。有了周作业计划，就是工段长不在，我们也能按进度表干活了。”有的说：“有了周作业计划，增产节约竞赛的目标就明确了，生产按步就班，天天见成绩，越做越有劲。”
    过去，在轴套工段办公桌上，看不见孔桃桃的影子。他就像“跑街”的一样，每天在车间里到处串：替这个领材料，又替那个拿刀具，一会儿又和职能组的同志争吵起来，到月底还要亲自上机床，加班突击生产。
    现在，孔桃桃已经提升为车间副主任又兼调度组组长。在他的办公桌旁边，有一块车间生产进度牌，老经验加上新办法，他能从调度牌上面看出每一个工段、每一个零件的生产情况。他还负责掌握大件工段的作业计划，什么零件先做，什么零件后做，哪一台机床要占多少时间，他都能算得清清楚楚。此外，每星期五，孔桃桃还要召集各工段长开生产会议，解决生产中的重要问题。
    有一次，车间党支部书记开玩笑似地问孔桃桃：“过去你管一个工段，现在管一个车间了，这个‘短命作业计划’怎么样？”孔桃桃笑着回答说：“你过去不是跟我讲过‘工人阶级要学会管理生产’吗？以后我更要好好学习，学会管一个厂、管许多厂，把党交给我们的光荣任务担当起来。”
