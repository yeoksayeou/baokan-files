　　Guo Shunxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Suburbs of Baoding City
　　Xu Yanzhang Xiao Han

　　The Guo Shunxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nandayuan Village, a suburb of Baoding City, Hebei Province, has a total of 22 households, 116 mu of land, and 65 laborers. In order to meet the needs of urban construction and solve the problem of surplus labor, they planted 34 mu of vegetables last year. Thanks to the advantages of being organized, both vegetables and crops had a bumper harvest last year. The total net income of the cooperative was more than 210 million yuan, and each labor day was worth more than 26,000 yuan. The income of most members was more than double that of the previous year.

　　Unified Cultivation, Able to Plant According to Local Conditions

　　The reason why this cooperative can achieve a bumper harvest is primarily because the land is managed in a unified manner, which can "make the best use of the land." The members used to have the habit of growing vegetables, but because of decentralized management and little land, they would grow some of everything, regardless of whether the soil was suitable or not, so some vegetables did not grow well. Being organized solved this problem. What kind of vegetables are suitable for that plot of land is planted, and even the type of crop rotation and what kind of seedlings to cultivate are arranged in detail. For example, a plot of 1.54 mu of land south of the bridge is suitable for growing aquatic vegetables. The cover vegetables planted in the first year are harvested by the vernal equinox, followed by cabbage. The cabbage is removed by the beginning of summer and shallots are planted. The shallots are pulled out by the Grain in Ear solar term, and honey cabbage is planted. After the summer solstice, the honey cabbage is removed and turnip cabbage is planted. The turnip cabbage is pulled out by the White Dew solar term, and autumn vegetables are planted. Five seasons of vegetables a year, without missing a single season.

　　Rewarding Labor, Achieving "Making the Best Use of Talent"

　　With many people and a large operation in the cooperative, it is important to rationally allocate labor and encourage everyone's enthusiasm for production. In order to achieve this goal, after democratic discussion, the cooperative stipulated that within the original output, dividends would be distributed according to a ratio of 50% labor and 50% land. If the total output of the cooperative's land exceeded the original output, dividends would be distributed at a ratio of 70% labor and 30% land for every stone of grain exceeded; 80% labor and 20% land for every two stones of grain exceeded; 90% labor and 10% land for every three stones of grain exceeded; and all the portion exceeding three stones of grain would go to labor. In this way, the enthusiasm of the members was brought into play. They also assigned work according to each person's strengths. For example, female members were deft and patient, so they were mobilized to do detailed work such as snacking, removing side shoots, weeding, and picking vegetables. This not only cultivated and improved the female members' vegetable management skills, but also supplemented the shortage of male labor. For example, members Xu Wencai and Fan Gengtian had experience in managing winter melons, so they led several female members to do and learn together. In the past, when the 22 members were working individually, each household had to carry a load of vegetables to the market every morning, which cost them money for food and expenses. After joining the cooperative, two or three people could sell thousands of catties of vegetables every day, and the rest of the people could specialize in tidying up the vegetables in the fields. According to the statistics for April alone, more than 200 workdays and more than 1.2 million yuan were saved.

　　Collective Labor, Facilitating Research and Improvement of Technology

　　Being organized not only enables "making the best use of the land" and "making the best use of talent," but also makes it easier to study how to improve technology and increase yields because everyone works together regularly. At the beginning of planting winter melons, Fan Junbo, the head of the production team, convened a meeting of members with experience in planting winter melons to study why the winter melons on the edge of the field grew bigger and the winter melons in the middle grew smaller. After everyone exchanged experiences, they believed that this was because the edges were more ventilated and exposed to the sun. Having found this trick, they decided to use the method of planting with ridges, which allowed the winter melons to be ventilated and exposed to the sun on all sides, and the middle of the land was planted with short plants such as cabbage. When they applied top dressing when working individually, they dug a pit on one side of the winter melon plant, put a lump of soybean cake in it, and buried it with soil. After analysis and research, they believed that this was not conducive to exerting the fertilizer effect, and sometimes it could even burn the roots on the fertilized side. Therefore, they changed to mixing the soybean cake evenly with the soil around the winter melon plant, and then burying it with soil on top. This method of fertilization made it easier to exert the fertilizer effect, and the winter melon plants grew stronger, laying the foundation for bearing large melons. Last year, one mu of winter melon produced more than 16,000 catties. In the past, women did not have the habit of going to the fields, and because they did not have production technology, their work efficiency was very low. Last year, the cooperative had more people, and they could teach each other, which solved the problem of women's low production technology. Over the past year, 19 female members who regularly participated in field production have learned vegetable management techniques, which have played a certain role in the cooperative's fine processing.

　　Ensuring the Stability of Vegetable Prices

　　There is an idiom in the vegetable market: "Even a fast horse cannot catch up with the vegetable market." Vegetable prices have never been accurate, and sometimes they change five or six times a day. Last year, the cooperative produced a large batch of vegetables, which played a certain role in stabilizing vegetable prices. For example, after tomatoes came down, they were 500 yuan per catty. Some merchants in the market wanted to raise the price to 600 yuan per catty, so the cooperative pulled 2,000 catties to the market and still sold them at 500 yuan per catty, which prevented the vegetable price from rising.

　　In addition, they also established a supply relationship with the troops, who could directly buy vegetables from the cooperative, which was stable in price, accurate in weight, and convenient. For example, last August, cabbage rose to 20,000 yuan per 100 catties, but they still sold 50,000 catties to the troops at 15,000 yuan per 100 catties. This played a certain role in stabilizing vegetable prices and ensuring the lives of urban people.

　　The cooperative's bumper harvest of vegetables last year greatly encouraged the members' enthusiasm for running the cooperative well. After a year of collective production, they all personally experienced that only by organizing suburban farmers and producing more vegetables to meet the needs of urban development can everyone become wealthy. They plan to expand the vegetable fields to 57 mu this year. Last year, the cooperative plowed all the vacant land with a 7-inch plow, and also extracted six people to specialize in accumulating coarse fertilizer. The cooperative is preparing to buy a rubber-tired cart and a water pump to prepare for a bumper harvest of vegetables this year.

　　保定市郊区的郭顺兴农业生产合作社
    许彦章　晓　寒
    河北省保定市南大园村郭顺兴农业生产合作社，共二十二户，一百一十六亩地，六十五个劳动力。他们为了适应城市建设的需要和解决剩余劳动力的问题，去年种了三十四亩蔬菜。由于发挥了组织起来的优越性，去年蔬菜和庄稼都得到丰收。全社共得纯收益两亿一千多万元，一个劳动日分两万六千多元，大部分社员的收入超过前年一倍以上。
    统一耕作，能够因地种植
    这个社所以能得到丰收，首先是由于土地统一经营，能作到“地尽其利”。社员们过去就有种菜的习惯，可是因为分散经营，土地少，不管土质适合不适合，什么菜也种一些，所以有些菜就长得不大好。组织起来就解决了这个问题。那块地适合种什么菜，就种什么菜，连那种菜倒什么茬，培育什么秧子等都有详细的安排。例如桥南有一亩五分四厘地，适合长水菜，头一年种上的遮秧青菜，到春分就收割了，种上白菜，到立夏起了白菜栽上了葱，到芒种拔了葱种上蜜蜂白菜，到夏至以后起了蜜蜂白菜又种上翻心白菜，到白露拔了翻心白菜又种上秋青菜。一年五季蔬菜，一步也没有错过季节。
    奖励劳动，做到“人尽其才”
    社里人多摊子大，合理调配劳动力，鼓励大家的生产积极性很重要。为了实现这个目的，社里经过民主讨论，规定在原产量以内，劳五地五比例分红；全社土地的产量如果超过了原订产量，折粮一石的按劳七地三分红，折粮两石的按劳八地二分红，折粮三石的按劳九地一分红，折粮三石以上的部分全归劳动力。这样，就发挥了社员的劳动积极性。他们还按每个人的特长分工，如女社员手轻有耐心，就发动她们做打尖、掰杈、拔草、摘菜等细致活。这样，既培养和提高了女社员管理蔬菜的技术，又补助了男劳动力的不足。像社员徐文才、范耕田管理东瓜有经验，就让他们领着几个女社员一面做一面学。以前二十二户社员在单干时，每户每天早晨一个人担上一挑子菜上市，去后得吃饭花钱；入社后，每天有两三个人就把几千斤菜卖出去了，其余的人就可在地里专门收拾蔬菜。只四月份的统计，就节省二百多个工，一百二十多万元。
    集体劳动，便于研究改进技术
    组织起来，不光能做到“地尽其利”、“人尽其才”，还由于大家经常在一起干活，容易研究如何改进技术和提高产量的办法。开始种东瓜时，生产股长范俊波，就召集有种东瓜经验的社员开会，研究为什么地边上的东瓜长得大，中间东瓜长得小。经过大家交流经验，认为这是边上透风和见太阳多的原因。找出了这个窍门，他们就决定用隔垅种的办法，可让东瓜四边透风见太阳，中间的地种白菜等矮植物。他们在单干时施追肥，是在东瓜棵的一边刨个坑，把豆饼放一疙瘩，再用土一埋就行了，经过分析研究，认为这样不容易发挥肥效，有时还能把施肥这半边的根烧坏。因此改变成把豆饼和东瓜棵四周围的土搅合均匀后，上边再埋上土，这样施肥，肥效容易发挥，东瓜棵长得壮实，给结大瓜打下了底子，去年一亩东瓜产了一万六千多斤。过去妇女没有下地习惯，又因为她们没有生产技术，干活效率很低，去年社里人多了，可以互相教学，把妇女生产技术低的问题也就解决了。一年来，十九名经常参加田间生产的妇女社员，都学会了管理蔬菜的技术，对社里加工细作起了一定作用。
      保障了菜价的稳定
    菜市上有句成语“快马赶不上水菜行”。菜价从来没有准行市，有时一天就变五、六个价。去年社里出产了大批的菜，在稳定菜价上起了一定作用。如西红柿下来后是五百元一斤，市上有些商人想抬高到六百元一斤，社里就拉到市上两千斤，仍按五百元一斤卖，结果使菜价没涨上去。
    另外，他们还和部队建立了供应关系，部队可直接到社里去买菜，价稳，秤准又方便。如去年八月里，白菜涨到两万元一百斤，他们仍按一万五千元一百斤卖给了部队五万斤。这就对稳定菜价，保障城市人民生活，起了一定作用。
    这个社去年的蔬菜丰收，大大鼓舞了社员办好社的热情。他们经过一年的集体生产，都亲身体验到郊区农民只有组织起来，多生产菜，适应城市的发展需要，同时这也是大家富裕的道路。他们计划今年要把菜田扩大到五十七亩。去年社里把所有的空白地都用七吋步犁耕了一遍，还抽出六个人专门积粗肥。社里正准备买一辆胶皮大车、一架抽水机，为今年蔬菜丰收做好准备。
