For three years since the establishment of the People's Liberation Committee of Qamdo Area, Xikang, under its leadership, the people of the entire area have launched various construction works and achieved significant results.

The Qamdo Area now governs fifteen directly subordinate Zongs and two Office Committees. The People's Representatives Conferences have been convened two to three times in each Zong. At the People's Representatives Conferences, the Zong People's Liberation Committees were successively established. In the thirty-nine tribes and the Bomê area, Office Committees and branches of the People's Liberation Committees of each Zong were established. A total of 372 committee members are participating in the work of the People's Liberation Committees at all levels, of which Tibetan committee members account for more than 90 percent. Patriotic figures from major temples in various regions have also participated in the work. All major matters in each region are decided and implemented by all committee members. The agencies of the People's Liberation Committees at all levels attach importance to adopting national forms for conducting work, and official documents are mostly used in both Tibetan and Chinese languages.

Over the past three years, the People's Liberation Committee of Qamdo Area has resolutely implemented the policy on nationalities and the policy of freedom of religious belief, and has adopted consultative methods to resolve some long-standing disputes among the Tibetan people, making internal relations among Tibetans increasingly harmonious. For example, the two villages of Renda and Cetong in Qamdo Zong used to not interact with each other across the river. After mediation by the People's Liberation Committee and education on patriotism and unity, the people of the two villages signed a unity pact, helping each other in production and eating, drinking, and dancing together. The monks, nuns, and laypeople of the entire area have realized the greatness of the policy on nationalities in various practical works, universally enhanced their patriotic ideology, and the relations between various nationalities and between the army and the people have become even closer.

The People's Liberation Committee deeply cares about the people's production cause. Over the past three years, the amount of seeds lent to farmers without interest has reached more than 580,000 jin. At each People's Representatives Conference and production conference, resolutions beneficial to the people's production were formulated. Over the past three years, more than 20,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed and more than 80,000 meters of canals have been repaired. Last year, the entire area reaped a bumper harvest of grain, with an average increase of 12 to 15 percent compared to 1952. The People's Liberation Committee has also established an agricultural and pastoral experimental farm, gaining a lot of production experience. Farmers in many places have also begun to improve their farming methods. The People's Liberation Committee also attaches importance to production work in pastoral areas, calling on herdsmen to protect female animals, young animals, and store grass for winter. The work of preventing and controlling animal diseases has been carried out throughout the area. The livestock inspected and treated by the animal disease prevention and control work team reached more than 114,000 heads, effectively preventing livestock diseases and rinderpest transmission.

The cultural, educational, and health undertakings in the Qamdo area are also gradually developing. There were no schools in the entire area at the time of liberation. Now there are nine public primary schools with more than 400 students. The schools have set up people's scholarships, enabling many children to have the opportunity to study. The cultural troupes in Qamdo, Dingqing, and Bomê have also trained a group of Tibetan literary and artistic cadres, performing national-style dramas and songs and dances in local languages, which are very popular among the masses. In the early days of liberation, the People's Liberation Army units stationed in various places and the People's Liberation Committee of Qamdo Area all had clinics, providing free medical treatment to the people. In 1952, the Qamdo Area People's Hospital was also established. Last year, the Nationalities Health Work Team of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government organized three mobile medical teams, cooperating with the Dingqing and Bomê medical teams, to go deep into rural and pastoral areas to treat the vast number of people, and united and helped local doctors, training more than 70 Tibetan health workers and midwives.

    三年来昌都地区各项建设工作有显著成绩
    西康昌都地区人民解放委员会成立三年来，领导全区人民开展各项建设工作，获得了显著成绩。
    昌都地区现辖十五个直属宗和两个办事处委员会。各宗已召开了二次到三次人民代表会议。在人民代表会议上，先后成立了宗人民解放委员会。在三十九族、波密地区成立了办事处委员会及各宗的人民解放委员会分会。参加各级人民解放委员会工作的委员，共有三百七十二人，其中藏族委员占百分之九十以上，各地主要寺庙的爱国人士也都参加了工作。各地区的重大事宜，都由全体委员议决施行。各级解放委员会机关重视采用民族形式进行工作，来往公文大都藏汉文兼用。
    三年来，昌都地区人民解放委员会坚决执行了民族政策和宗教信仰自由政策，采取协商办法解决了一些藏族人民中长期未能解决的纠纷，使藏族内部关系日益融洽。如昌都宗的仁达和撤同两个村庄，过去隔河不相往来，经解放委员会调解并进行了爱国团结的教育后，两村人民签订了团结公约，在生产上互相帮助，并在一块吃酒跳舞。全区僧俗人民在各项实际工作中体会到民族政策的伟大，普遍提高了爱国主义思想，各民族间和军民间的关系也更加亲密。
    人民解放委员会深切关怀人民生产事业。三年来，仅无息贷给农民的种籽即达五十八万多斤。历次人民代表会议和生产会议，都制订了有利于人民生产的决议。三年来全区共开荒两万多亩，修水渠八万多公尺。去年全区粮食获得丰收，平均较一九五二年增产百分之十二到十五。人民解放委员会还建立了一处农牧试验场，取得了不少生产经验，很多地方的农民也已开始改进了耕作方法。人民解放委员会并重视牧区的生产工作，号召牧民保护母畜、幼畜和储草备冬。防治兽疫工作已在全区开展。经兽疫防治工作大队检查和治疗的牲畜达十一万四千多头，有效地防止了牲畜疾病和牛瘟传染。
    昌都地区的文教卫生事业也在逐渐发展。全区在解放时没有一所学校，现有公立小学九所，学生四百多人。学校设置了人民助学金，使许多儿童得到学习的机会。昌都、丁青和波密三地的文工队组织，还培养了一批藏族文艺干部，用本地语言演出民族形式的戏剧和歌舞，深受群众欢迎。解放初期，驻各地的人民解放军部队及昌都地区人民解放委员会，都设有门诊所，免费给人民治病。一九五二年并成立了昌都地区人民医院。中央人民政府卫生部民族卫生工作大队去年组织了三个巡回医疗队，配合丁青、波密医疗队，深入农村牧场为广大人民治病，并团结和帮助本地医生，培养了藏族卫生员和接生员七十多人。　（新华社）
