    Serving Consumers Better
    Gao Fengchao, Beijing Model Worker, Beijing Department Store Salesman

    I am a salesman at the Beijing Department Store. In July 1952, when the department store launched the patriotic labor competition, the leadership assigned me the task of promoting bicycles. In half a year, I sold more than 11,000 bicycles for the country. From January to May 1953, I united the three field sales teams of the wholesale department and sold a large number of hardware, electrical materials, and bicycles. The monthly sales volume exceeded 80% of the wholesale department's total sales volume. Due to these achievements in my work, I was rated as a Beijing Model Worker. In the summer of 1953, the trade union even sent me to the Beidaihe Model Worker Sanatorium for recuperation. This was a great encouragement to me.

    Among the employees of our state-owned commercial departments, a small number of people believe that engaging in commercial work is not promising and not as good as engaging in industry or military affairs. I think this idea is wrong, mainly because they have not recognized the importance of state-owned commerce. They have not seen that our motherland is constantly advancing, and the living standards of the people are increasing day by day. Under such circumstances, the supply task undertaken by state-owned commerce is even heavier. Our work is closely related to national construction and people's lives, and therefore it is also glorious.

    The new year of 1954 has arrived, which is the second year that our country has entered its first five-year plan. How should salesmen in state-owned commercial departments meet the growing needs of the people? After participating in the study of the general line, I understand even more that to do a good job in sales, in addition to continuing to maintain close contact with various agencies and units, establishing relationships, and signing supply contracts, we must rely on cooperatives, establish close relationships with cooperatives, help them become familiar with the business, so that they can become powerful assistants to state-owned commerce, and use legitimate retail merchants to supply a large number of commodities to the vast number of consumers through them. In 1954, I want to do the following work: 1. Expand business relations with suburban cooperatives and assist the cooperatives to fully meet the needs of their members. 2. Ensure that individual sales volume accounts for 40% of the team's sales volume. 3. Learn humbly from everyone and tell the newly arrived salesmen the experience I have gained in my work without reservation, unite all comrades in the team, do a good job in sales, increase accumulation for the country, and meet the needs of consumers.

    更好地为消费者服务
    北京市甲等劳动模范  北京市百货公司推销员  高凤朝
    我是北京市百货公司的推销员。一九五二年七月，百货公司开展爱国主义劳动竞赛的时候，上级给我的推销自行车的任务，我在半年中为国家推销了一万一千多辆自行车。一九五三年一至五月份，我团结了批发部三个外勤推销小组，推销了大批五金、电料和自行车，每月推销额都超过批发部推销总额百分之八十。由于在工作中有了这些成绩，被评为北京市甲等劳动模范。一九五三年夏天，工会还送我到北戴河劳动模范休养所去休养。这对我都是很大的鼓励。
    在我们国营商业部门的职工中间，有一小部分人认为搞商业工作没出息，不如搞工业或军事好。我认为这种想法是不对的，这主要是因为没有认识到国营商业的重要性。他们没有看到我们的祖国是在不断地前进着，人民的生活水平正在日益增长。在这种情况下，国营商业所担负的供应任务也就更加重了。我们的工作是和国家建设、人民生活有着密切关系的，因此也是光荣的。
    一九五四年的新年来到了，这是我们的国家已经进入第一个五年计划的第二年。国营商业部门的推销员应该怎样来满足人民日益增长的需要呢？我参加总路线学习后，更明白了要作好推销工作，除了继续密切联系各机关、单位，建立关系，订立供应合同外，必须依靠合作社，和合作社建立密切的关系，帮助他们熟悉业务，使他们能成为国营商业的有力助手，并利用正当经营的零售商，通过他们，把大量商品供应给广大消费者。一九五四年我要做好以下工作：一、扩大和郊区合作社的业务关系，协助合作社做到充分供应社员的需要。二、保证个人的推销额占小组推销额的百分之四十。三、虚心地向大家学习，并把自己在工作中摸索的经验毫无保留地告诉新来的推销员，团结全组同志，做好推销工作，为国家增加积累，满足消费者的需要。
