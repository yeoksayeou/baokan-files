Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: According to Vietnam News Agency on January 27th: Vietnamese political parties and mass organizations participating in the opening ceremony of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, which was presided over by the Central Organizing Committee of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, sent a telegram to Chairman Malenkov of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. The text is as follows:
    On the occasion of the opening of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, we would like to express our deep gratitude to you, Mr. Chairman.
    The great October Socialist Revolution and the heroic struggle of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union against fascism provided favorable conditions for our people to advance the Vietnamese "August Revolution" to victory. Due to the victory of the Chinese revolution, Vietnam has established ties with the socialist and new democratic camp countries headed by the Soviet Union.
    The Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month has greatly inspired the Vietnamese people, who are determined to strengthen the friendly relations between the Vietnamese people and the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, and to intensify the study of the revolutionary experiences of the Soviet Union and China in order to advance the war of resistance until victory.
    We wish you, Mr. Chairman, good health, and wish the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ever greater strength in leading the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union to achieve complete victory in the cause of building communism and defending world peace.

    值此越苏中友好月开幕之际，我们谨向您、主席阁下致深切的感激之意。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命和苏联各族人民反法西斯主义的英雄斗争，为我国人民提供了有利的条件，使他们能够把越南“八月革命”推向胜利。由于中国革命的胜利，越南才和以苏联为首的社会主义和新民主主义阵营各国建立了联系。
