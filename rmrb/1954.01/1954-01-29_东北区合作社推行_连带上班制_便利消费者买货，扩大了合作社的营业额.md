　　Northeast Cooperative Promotes "Joint Work System"
　　Facilitates Consumer Purchases and Expands Cooperative Turnover
    In the Northeast region's cooperative system, during the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, the "Joint Work System" has been promoted in a guided manner, according to the specific circumstances of cooperatives in various localities. According to incomplete statistics from ten provinces and cities including Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, and Liaodong, as of mid-December last year, 1,962 cooperatives had implemented this advanced experience. Among them, supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives in cities and towns have implemented a complete "Joint Work System," namely "rotation system" and "interspersed work"; generally, rural supply and marketing cooperatives have only temporarily promoted the "rotation system" due to short winter days and agricultural slack season. In order to meet the needs of a small number of members who buy goods during non-business hours, supply and marketing cooperatives such as Jiyang Village in Yongji County, Jilin Province, and Yaoqianhu Village in the suburbs of Shenyang have established "early morning and evening retail stores."
    When promoting the "Joint Work System," cooperatives in various parts of Northeast China have paid attention to promoting it based on needs and possible conditions. In cooperatives with strong leadership, relatively sound business management systems, and high ideological and professional levels of employees, the "rotation system" and "interspersed work" were implemented simultaneously; cooperatives that did not meet the above conditions first implemented the "rotation system" and actively created conditions to prepare for the implementation of "interspersed work" to implement a complete "Joint Work System." When promoting the "Joint Work System," many cooperatives first used methods such as summarizing work and counting business times to study the flow patterns of consumers, rationally arranged the working hours of salespersons, fully exploited the potential of salespersons, and improved work methods and strengthened commodity pricing systems to adapt to the needs of the "Joint Work System."
    After the implementation of the "Joint Work System" by cooperatives in various localities, the external business hours were extended, and the working hours of the salespersons were shortened, which facilitated consumers to purchase goods, expanded the turnover of the cooperatives, and won the support of the salespersons. According to statistics, after canceling public holidays and changing to the "rotation system," and reasonably arranging the working hours of salespersons, the business hours can be increased by about 70 hours per month, which is equivalent to an increase of 25 percent of the business hours per day. After twenty-two grassroots cooperatives in Andong City implemented the "Joint Work System," the daily sales amount increased by 20 to 30 percent; the working hours of sales personnel, however, were shortened from ten hours to eight hours per day. Many consumers reflected before the cooperative implemented the "Joint Work System": "The cooperative only opens when we go to work, and the cooperative also closes when we get off work, it is difficult to buy something!" After the cooperative implemented the "Joint Work System," many customers wrote in the suggestion book: "This is the attitude of serving the people."
    Currently, there are still some problems in the Northeast region's cooperative's promotion of the "Joint Work System." First of all, some leading cadres of grassroots cooperatives believe: "To implement the joint work system and extend business hours, it is necessary to increase cadres." Therefore, personnel are blindly increased, resulting in unreasonable phenomena such as a slight increase in turnover and a decrease in the workload per person. Secondly, some cooperatives have not established a sound responsibility system, resulting in confusion such as no one being responsible. These problems should be paid attention to and resolved.

### 东北区合作社推行“连带上班制”  便利消费者买货，扩大了合作社的营业额

　　东北区合作社推行“连带上班制”
　　便利消费者买货，扩大了合作社的营业额
    东北区合作社系统在增产节约运动中，根据各地合作社的具体情况，有领导地推广了“连带上班制”。据沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、辽东等十个省、市的不完全统计，截至去年十二月中旬止，已有一千九百六十二个合作社推行了这一先进经验。其中城市和集镇的供销、消费合作社推行了完整的“连带上班制”，即“轮休制”和“插班作业”；一般农村供销合作社，因为冬季天短、农闲，暂时只推广了“轮休制”。为了满足在非营业时间买货的少数社员的需要，吉林省永吉县吉阳村和沈阳市郊姚千户屯等供销合作社设立了“早晚零售店”。
    东北各地合作社在推行“连带上班制”的时候，都注意根据需要和可能条件进行推广。在领导能力较强、业务管理制度比较健全、职工思想和业务水平比较高的合作社，同时实行了“轮休制”和“插班作业”；不具备上述条件的合作社，便首先实行“轮休制”，并积极创造条件，准备推行“插班作业”，实行完整的“连带上班制”。许多合作社在推行“连带上班制”的时候，都首先用总结工作和统计营业次数等方法，研究了消费者的流动规律，合理地安排了营业员的作息时间，充分发挥了营业员的潜在力量，同时改进了工作方法，加强了商品标价等制度，以适应“连带上班制”的需要。
    各地合作社推行“连带上班制”后，延长了对外营业的时间，缩短了营业员的劳动时间，这就便利了消费者购买货物，扩大了合作社的营业额，并获得了营业员的拥护。据统计，取消公休日改为“轮休制”，和合理地安排营业员的作息时间以后，每月可增加约七十小时的营业时间，相当于每日增加了百分之二十五的营业时间。安东市二十二个基层合作社推行“连带上班制”后，每天的卖钱额增加百分之二十到三十；营业人员的劳动时间，却由每天十小时缩短到八小时。许多消费者在合作社没有实行“连带上班制”以前反映：“我们上班时合作社才开门，我们下班，合作社也关门，买点东西可难啦！”合作社推行“连带上班制”以后，许多顾客在意见簿上写道：“这才是为人民服务的态度。”
    目前，东北区合作社推行“连带上班制”中还存在一些问题。首先，有些基层合作社的领导干部认为：“实行连带上班制，延长营业时间，必须增加干部。”因而盲目增加人员，造成营业额稍有增加、每人工作量下降的不合理的现象。其次，有的合作社没有很好地建立责任制，发生了无人负责等混乱现象。这些问题，应注意解决。
