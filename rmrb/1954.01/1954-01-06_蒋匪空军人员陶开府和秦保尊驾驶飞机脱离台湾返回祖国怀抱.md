Xinhua News Agency Report: Tao Kaifu, a flight student from the remnant Chiang Kai-shek Air Force Military Academy, and Qin Baozun, a radio mechanic from the Chiang Kai-shek army's Tainan Air Force Direction Finding Station, flew an "AT-6" advanced trainer aircraft (numbered 145) from the airport of the academy in Gangshan Township, Kaohsiung County, Taiwan, on the evening of December 18, 1953, and returned to the embrace of the motherland.

Tao Kaifu and Qin Baozun were welcomed by the local People's Liberation Army and the people when they landed in a certain place in Fujian.

After flying back to the mainland, they told reporters about their excitement after returning to the embrace of the motherland and denounced the crimes of American imperialism's occupation of Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's betrayal of the country.

They said: After we were forced to Taiwan in 1949, we personally witnessed the conspiracy of American imperialism to invade China and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's crimes of betraying the country. Today, Taiwan has become a colony of American imperialism and a springboard for American imperialism to invade China and Asia. The American military advisory group in Taiwan is actually the supreme emperor of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. They have stationed so-called "advisory groups" in every remnant Chiang Kai-shek military department and every military base, directly planning and commanding the Chiang army's equipment, training, and operations. In mid-July 1953, the remnant Chiang Kai-shek army's intrusion into Dongshan Island, Fujian Province, was personally planned and commanded by American "military advisors." American imperialism's economic aggression against Taiwan is even more pervasive. They have seized all of Taiwan's important enterprises. All the military supplies we received in Taiwan and everything we could buy on the market were mostly American goods. Even the soybean cakes used by farmers for fertilization and the flour used for daily consumption were mostly from the United States. Under the heavy oppression of the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the people of all classes in Taiwan live in extreme poverty. The farmers we saw in Tainan, Kaohsiung, and other places were mostly sallow and emaciated, dressed in rags, and often could only fill their hunger with sweet potatoes. The income of ordinary public employees and workers is very meager, and they live a half-starved life. The American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits fear the resistance of the people and have adopted various cruel means to suppress the people's just struggles. Even in remote villages, there are plainclothes secret agents and police everywhere. The people's words and actions are closely monitored. Any slight dissatisfaction is in danger of being sentenced to imprisonment or death. The American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits do not even trust their own army. Secret agents monitor officers and soldiers. In the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force Communications School and the Air Force Military Academy, every letter received by students from outside the school must go through three checks by the Chiang Kai-shek secret service organization "Ministry of National Defense Confidentiality Bureau" stationed at the post office inspection team and the secret agents in the school. Many Chiang Kai-shek soldiers committed suicide because they were hopeless about the future and had difficulty making a living. Zhao Desheng, a communication captain from the First Squadron of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force Supervisory Corps, and Hao Jingjiang, a lieutenant maintenance officer from the Donggang Carrier Wave Squadron of the Communications Corps, both committed suicide because of this.

All of this has made us feel extremely painful and ashamed, and we deeply regret going astray. After we initially learned radio technology, we often risked listening to broadcasts from the mainland. The victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the project to harness the Huai River, the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and the construction of Anshan and other inspiring news made us see a paradise-like motherland in the dark hell. We made up our minds to return to the embrace of the motherland. December 18, 1953, is a day we will never forget. That night, we landed safely in a certain place in Fujian. We were immediately warmly welcomed by the local People's Liberation Army and the people. For nearly half a month, we have been welcomed by the people of the motherland everywhere. What makes us even more excited is seeing the happy and prosperous scene of the motherland. All of this has made us feel unprecedented warmth and glory.

Finally, they said: Motherland! I thank you. In the future, we will do everything we can to work with the people of the whole country to make you more prosperous and beautiful!

    蒋匪空军人员陶开府和秦保尊
    驾驶飞机脱离台湾返回祖国怀抱
    据新华社讯：残余蒋匪军空军军官学校飞行生陶开府和蒋匪军台南空军测向台无线电机械士秦保尊，在一九五三年十二月十八日晚驾驶“AT—六”高级教练机（编号一四五）一架，自台湾高雄县冈山镇该校机场起飞，回到祖国怀抱。
    陶开府和秦保尊在福建某地着陆时，受到当地人民解放军和人民的欢迎。
    他们飞回祖国大陆后，向记者叙述他们回到祖国怀抱后的兴奋心情，并控诉美帝国主义侵占台湾和蒋介石匪帮卖国的罪行。
    他们说：我们在一九四九年被胁迫到台湾以后，亲自看到了美帝国主义侵略中国的阴谋和蒋介石匪帮卖国的罪行。今天台湾已变为美帝国主义的殖民地，成为美帝国主义侵略中国和亚洲的跳板。美国驻台湾军事顾问团实际上就是蒋介石匪帮的太上皇。他们在每一个残余蒋匪的军事部门和每一个军事基地中，都派驻有所谓“顾问小组”，直接策划和指挥蒋军的装备、训练、作战等事宜。一九五三年七月中旬，残余蒋匪军窜犯福建省东山岛，就是由美国“军事顾问”亲自部署和指挥的。美帝国主义对台湾的经济侵略，更是无孔不入。他们攫夺了台湾的一切重要企业。我们在台湾时所领到的一切军用品和在市场上所能买到的东西，绝大部分都是美国货，就是农民施肥用的豆饼和日常食用的面粉，许多也是美国来的。在美、蒋匪帮重重压榨下，台湾各阶层人民生活困苦不堪。我们在台南、高雄等地所看到的农民，大多数面黄肌瘦，衣服褴褛，经常只能以红薯充饥。一般公教人员、工人收入都很微薄，过着半饥不饱的生活。美、蒋匪帮害怕人民的反抗，采用了各种残酷的手段镇压人民的正义斗争，甚至在偏僻的乡村中也遍布着便衣特务和警察，人民一言一动都受到严密的监视，稍有不满情绪，即有被判处徒刑、死刑的危险。美、蒋匪帮即使对自己的军队也不信任，特务监视着军官和士兵。在蒋匪空军通讯学校、空军军官学校中，学员所收到的每一封从校外寄来的信件，都要经过蒋匪特务组织“国防部保密局”驻邮局检查小组和学校中的特务人员的三道检查。许多蒋匪军因为前途绝望、生活困难而自杀。蒋匪空军监察总队第一区队通讯上尉赵德胜、通讯总队东港载波中队分队中尉机务员郝敬江等人都因此自杀身死。
    以上这一切都使我们感到万分痛苦和耻辱，深悔误入歧途。我们在初步学会了无线电技术后，就时常冒险收听祖国大陆的广播。抗美援朝的胜利和根治淮河的工程、成渝铁路的通车、鞍山的建设等等振奋人心的消息，使我们在暗无天日的黑地狱中，看到了天堂般的祖国。我们下定决心回到祖国的怀抱里来。一九五三年十二月十八日是我们永远不能忘记的日子。那一天晚上，我们在福建某地安全降落了。我们立即受到当地人民解放军和人民的热情款待。近半个月来，我们到处受到祖国人民的欢迎，更使我们兴奋的是看到了祖国幸福繁荣的景象。这一切使我们感受到有生以来从未有过的温暖和光荣。
    最后，他们说：祖国啊！我感谢你，今后我们将尽自己所能，与全国人民在一起，为使你更加富强、美丽而奋斗！
