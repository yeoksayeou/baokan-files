In 1953, under the guidance of the general line of the state during the transition period, the work of preferential treatment for families of servicemen and veterans across the country achieved further progress, along with the development of industrial and agricultural production and construction. In the vast rural areas, governments at all levels have attached particular importance to organizing the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers to participate in agricultural production along the path of mutual aid and cooperation, and to help them establish households. In the cities, the people's governments have actively sought ways to introduce the families of martyrs and servicemen with employment potential to participate in economic construction, while organizing those with poorer employment conditions to engage in diverse cooperative small-scale production or handicraft production, so that their lives can be gradually improved.

In rural areas, various localities have paid special attention to guiding the families of martyrs, servicemen, and demobilized and transferred soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In some old liberated areas of North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China, the proportion of families of martyrs and servicemen and demobilized and transferred soldiers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations has reached over 70%. According to statistics from some villages in Anqiu, Rongcheng, and other counties in Shandong Province, the participation of families of martyrs and servicemen in mutual aid and cooperative organizations accounted for 57% of the total number of households. Many of these people have been selected as model laborers or become key members in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. For example, Shen Jilan, the vice chairman of the nationally renowned Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Ping順 County, Shanxi Province, is an outstanding family member of a revolutionary soldier. Zhang Zhengfa, a second-class disabled revolutionary soldier from Xiwang Village, Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, was also elected by the masses as the leader of the central mutual aid group in the village.

While mobilizing the families of martyrs and servicemen to participate in production, various localities have also rectified the work of land cultivation on their behalf. Shanxi and Hebei provinces have carried out unified adjustments at the provincial level. Other regions have mostly carried out rectification within the scope of townships. After the rectification, the area of land cultivated on their behalf was appropriately reduced, the unreasonable situations in the cultivation were changed, and the number of people participating in the cultivation services was expanded. In this way, the enjoyment of cultivation on behalf and the burden of cultivation on behalf have become fairer and more reasonable, ensuring the cultivation of land for the truly impoverished families of martyrs and servicemen who lack labor. In areas where the mutual aid and cooperation movement has developed well, the work of cultivation on behalf has been combined with mutual aid and cooperative organizations. For example, in Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces, the land cultivated on behalf by mutual aid and cooperative organizations accounts for 80% to 90% of the total land cultivated on behalf. More than half of the counties in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces have also promoted this method.

In carrying out preferential treatment work, various localities have paid attention to helping the families of martyrs and servicemen establish households. Last year, the Northeast region concentrated 56 billion yuan of preferential treatment funds as a special fund to help the families of martyrs and servicemen with production and household establishment. Many families of martyrs and servicemen used this money to add vehicles and buy horses, improve their lives, and voluntarily declined cultivation on their behalf. According to incomplete statistics from 40 counties in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces, in the past three years, a total of 14,739 impoverished families of martyrs and servicemen were given 5,961 head of livestock, 10,602 sheep, 6,252 pieces of agricultural implements, and 2,341 new or repaired cave dwellings, and 271 textile machines. These families of martyrs and servicemen who have established households have the conditions to participate in production, and the land of many families of martyrs and servicemen has increased production, and their lives have been improved, so they no longer need cultivation on their behalf or material subsidies.

In the cities, due to the development of economic construction, the work of introducing occupations for the families of martyrs and servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers has become more convenient than in previous years. The civil affairs departments of the people's governments in many cities have strengthened contact with relevant departments, taken the initiative to understand the employment needs of various parties, and paid attention to conducting employment education for the families of martyrs and servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, so that they can get employment opportunities. According to statistics from five cities in Hunan Province, Changsha, Hengyang, Changde, Xiangtan, and Shaoyang, in the first half of 1953 alone, 4,368 people were introduced to employment, and Beijing also introduced 1,693 people to employment in the past year. Great achievements have also been made in organizing the families of martyrs and servicemen to participate in production in cities. The cities in the Northeast and Beijing have reorganized the production units with the participation of the families of martyrs and servicemen, and turned them into local state-owned enterprises or production cooperatives, so that they can be further developed. In addition, cities in various localities have also strengthened assistance to the small-scale production or family handicrafts of the families of martyrs and servicemen. For example, among the 155 water selling stations and water selling shops in Jinan City, 127 are managed by the families of martyrs and servicemen and disabled revolutionary soldiers, with a monthly income of about 24.13 million yuan. The city also allocated more than 29 million yuan to organize the families of martyrs and servicemen to establish three collective production units for sewing, rope making, and coal, and assisted 131 households in carrying out individual production such as laundry and bamboo weaving.

Over the past year, various localities have universally rectified the schools for disabled revolutionary soldiers, implemented the educational policy of "focusing on improving culture and cultivating employment conditions," and determined and adopted a teaching method that is both rapid and steady. At present, 30% of the students in the national schools for disabled revolutionary soldiers are studying in junior high school employment classes, and the students have expressed that they will study hard and prepare to participate in the construction of the motherland. According to statistics from the schools for disabled revolutionary soldiers in Jiangxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, Songjiang, and Shaanxi provinces, among the primary school graduates in the summer of last year, 358 were admitted to the worker-peasant accelerated middle schools, and among the junior high school graduates, in addition to some who have been admitted to various technical schools for further study, another 309 have been assigned jobs.

In order to make the future work of preferential treatment more adaptable to the requirements of the general line of the state during the transition period and serve it, the Second National Civil Affairs Conference held in October 1953 specially discussed this issue. The conference unanimously agreed that mobilizing and organizing the families of martyrs and servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers to engage in labor production must be regarded as the primary task, and encouraging and absorbing them to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations must be regarded as the main direction. Therefore, they should be regularly educated on the glory of labor and the future of social development, so that they can become active responders to the various calls of the Party and the government, and active members in mass production and social activities, and actively participate in various construction undertakings under the leadership of the Party and the government.

### 一九五三年全国优抚工作有很大成绩

    一九五三年全国优抚工作有很大成绩
    一九五三年全国各地的优抚工作，在国家过渡时期总路线的照耀下，随着工农业生产建设的发展，已获得进一步的成就。在广大的农村里，各级人民政府特别重视组织革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人按照互助合作的道路参加农业生产，并帮助他们建立家务。在城市里，人民政府积极设法介绍有就业条件的烈属、军属参加经济建设，同时组织就业条件较差的烈属、军属从事多种多样的合作性质的小型生产或手工业生产，使他们的生活逐步得到改善。
    在农村中，各地特别注意引导烈属、军属和复员转业军人参加互助合作组织。在华北、东北、西北的部分老区，参加互助合作组织的烈属、军属和复员转业军人已达百分之七十以上。山东省安邱、荣成等县的部分乡村的统计：烈属、军属参加互助合作组织的已占总户数的百分之五十七。这些人中有许多人并被选为劳动模范或成为互助合作运动中的骨干分子。如全国著名的山西省平顺县李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的副社长申纪兰，就是一个优秀的革命军人家属。安徽省全椒县西王村二等甲级革命残废军人张正发也被群众选为该村中心互助组组长。
    各地在发动烈属、军属参加生产的同时，对代耕工作也进行了整顿。山西、河北两省以省为单位进行了统一调剂。其他地区多在乡的范围内进行整理。经过整顿，适当地缩小了代耕土地的面积，改变了代耕中的不合理的情况，扩大了参加代耕勤务的人数，这样，就使享受代耕和负担代耕趋于公平合理，使真正缺乏劳力的贫苦烈属、军属土地的耕种，获得了保证。在互助合作运动开展较好的地区，代耕工作已和互助合作组织结合起来。如松江、黑龙江两省由互助合作组织负责代耕的土地已占总代耕土地的百分之八十到九十。江西、福建两省也有半数以上的县推行了这一办法。
    各地在进行优抚工作中，都注意帮助烈属、军属建立家务。东北区去年集中优抚事业费五百六十亿元作为帮助烈属、军属生产建立家务的专款，很多烈属、军属用这笔钱添车买马，改善生活，自动谢绝代耕。据甘肃、陕西两省四十个县不完全统计，三年以来，共给一万四千七百三十九户贫苦烈属、军属买牲畜五千九百六十一头，羊一万零六百零二只，农具六千二百五十二件，建修窑房二千三百四十一间，纺织机二百七十一架。这些已建立了家务的烈属、军属都有条件参加生产，许多烈属、军属的土地并获得增产，生活得到改善，因而已不需要代耕或给予实物补助了。
    在城市里，由于经济建设的开展，为烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人介绍职业的工作，就比往年更加便利。许多城市的人民政府民政部门加强了和各有关部门的联系，主动去了解各方面需要用人的情况，并注意对烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人进行就业教育，使他们得到就业机会。据湖南省长沙、衡阳、常德、湘潭、邵阳等五个市的统计，仅一九五三年上半年就介绍了四千三百六十八人就业，北京市一年来也介绍了一千六百九十三人就业。在城市组织烈属、军属参加生产方面也有很大成绩，东北各市和北京市都已把有烈属、军属参加的生产单位加以整顿，转为地方国营企业或生产合作社，使其得到进一步的发展。此外，各地城市还加强了对烈属、军属小型生产或家庭手工业的扶助。如在济南市一百五十五处售水站和售水铺中，有一百二十七处是由烈属、军属和革命残废军人看管，每月约可收入二千四百一十三万元。该市又拨款二千九百多万元，组织烈属、军属成立缝纫、编绳、煤炭等三个集体生产单位，并扶助了一百三十一户进行洗衣、编竹货等个体生产。
    一年来，各地对革命残废军人学校普遍进行了整顿，贯彻了“以提高文化与培养就业条件为主”的教育方针，确定和采取了速成而又是稳步前进的教学方法。目前全国革命残废军人学校已有百分之三十的学员在初中就业班次学习，学员们都表示要努力学习，准备参加祖国建设。据江西、山东、江苏、福建、松江、陕西等省革命残废军人学校统计，去年暑期小学毕业学员中就有三百五十八人考入工农速成中学，初中毕业学员中，除一部分已考入各种技术学校深造外，另有三百零九人分配了工作。
    为了使今后的优抚工作能更加适应国家过渡时期总路线的要求并为其服务，一九五三年十月举行的第二次全国民政会议曾专门讨论了这个问题。会议一致认为，必须把发动和组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人从事劳动生产当作首要的任务，把鼓励和吸收他们参加互助合作组织当作主要的方向。因此应该向他们经常进行劳动光荣的教育，社会发展前途的教育，使他们成为党和政府各项号召的积极响应者，群众生产和社会活动中的积极分子，在党和政府领导下积极参加各种建设事业。　　　　　（新华社）
