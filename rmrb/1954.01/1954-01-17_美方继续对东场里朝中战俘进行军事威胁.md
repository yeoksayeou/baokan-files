Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: The US side continues to make military threats against Korean and Chinese POWs in the Tongchang-ri POW camp.

	On the morning of the 15th, intermittent bursts of heavy machine gun fire were heard again in the northeastern US-controlled area of the POW camp. Behind Hill 115, east of the POW camp, there were occasional rumbling explosions and artillery fire. At 1:30 PM on the 14th, dense machine gun and rifle fire suddenly erupted in the US-controlled area near the POW camp, lasting for nearly three hours.

	According to reports from our side's civil affairs police, on the night of the 14th, US special agents in the camp again forced the POWs to practice emergency assembly. Immediately, the POW camp was filled with murderous shouts and yells. Our civil affairs police also heard the sound of hammering metal in the Tongchang-ri POW camp on the night of the 14th, which continued until 2:00 AM on the 15th. Recently repatriated Korean and Chinese POWs have revealed that US special agents in the Tongchang-ri POW camp are working day and night to modify bayonets from gasoline drums, etc., for use in a planned seizure of POWs on January 23rd.

    美方继续对东场里朝中战俘进行军事威胁
    【新华社开城十六日电】美方继续对东场里战俘营里的朝中战俘进行军事威胁。
    十五日上午，战俘营东北美方地区内又断断续续地响着重机枪发射的声音。战俘营以东的一一五高地背后，不时响起一阵阵隆隆的爆炸声和大炮声。十四日下午一时半，在临近战俘营的美方地区内，突然响起了紧密的机枪和步枪的声音，枪声一直响了近三个小时。
    据我方民政警察报告，在十四日晚上，营场里的美方特务又强迫战俘演习紧急集合。顿时，战俘营内响起了一片杀气腾腾的吆喝和嘶叫的声音。我方民政警察在十四日夜里还听到东场里战俘营内发出叮叮噹噹打铁的声音，一直响到十五日二时才停止。最近遣返归来的朝中被俘人员曾揭露：东场里战俘营内的美方特务正在连夜用汽油桶等改制刺刀，以供在一月二十三日劫夺战俘之用。
