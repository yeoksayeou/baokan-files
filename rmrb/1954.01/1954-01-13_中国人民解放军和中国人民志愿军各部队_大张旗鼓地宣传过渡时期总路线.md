The People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army extensively promote the general line for the transition period
    The land, sea, and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, along with their various departments, and schools, are extensively promoting the Party's general line for the transition period to the broad masses of officers and soldiers. This widespread and in-depth propaganda and education movement has enhanced the socialist thinking of officers and soldiers.
    Before extensively promoting the general line, all units made ample preparations. To facilitate the systematic study of the general line within their respective units throughout the year, the Party committees of all branches of the military and units successively established central study groups, and leading organs also established advanced study classes. Some units held training courses for senior cadres, starting their study of the general line early. Political departments of the Northeast Military Region, North China Military Region, Central South Military Region, and the Air Force, among others, successively held training courses, training a large number of leading cadres and core members for studying the general line.
    Before the New Year, all units universally began promoting the Party's general line for the transition period. The leaders of all units first personally delivered reports on the general line for the transition period. Ye Jianying, Acting Commander of the Central South Military Region, Song Renqiong, Deputy Political Commissar of the Southwest Military Region, Zhang Xiushan, Deputy Political Commissar of the Northeast Military Region, and Luo Shunchu, Deputy Commander of the Navy, among others, delivered reports at cadre meetings. All departments universally held conferences, gave reports, taught classes, and organized discussions. Many units also used on-site visits and illustrative teaching methods to assist in the propaganda and education of the general line, organizing cadres and soldiers to visit factories and farms, and inviting model workers and farmers to give reports. Since December of last year, the units of the Northwest Military Region began showing over 40 films such as "Happy Life," "Donbass Miners," and "Chengdu-Chongqing Railway" to help cadres and soldiers study the general line. The clubs and libraries of the units in the Fujian Military Region published special issues and introduced many reference books for everyone to read. The wired broadcasts of each unit regularly broadcast articles related to the general line from the People's Daily and unit newspapers. Some units also exhibited and screened pictures and slides introducing China's economic construction and the Soviet Union's socialist industrialization. Some units also cited vivid materials from local industrial and agricultural production to specifically explain the content of the general line. To ensure that everyone knew the general line, some units organized work teams to go deep into the troops stationed on the border for propaganda, and all units also paid attention to making up lessons for personnel on outside assignments. The Logistics Department of the Shandong Military Region also sent special personnel to hospitals, supply stations, and other organs and units stationed in various locations to promote the general line. Now, even the soldiers stationed on Hainan Island, far from the mainland of the motherland, already know the basic content of the general line.
    After initially studying the general line for the transition period, cadres and soldiers said: "The general line for the transition period has illuminated our hearts. We should work and study harder, and strive to defend the construction of the motherland." "Building a socialist society cannot wait" has become the slogan for everyone to take action, and everyone's enthusiasm for work and study has become even higher. In military training, cadres and soldiers are not afraid of the cold weather, practice diligently, and actively study advanced Soviet military science and military technology. Soldiers guarding the border and coastal defense, after hearing the report on the general line, can connect their duties with the general line. They clarified that defending the border and coastal defense is a concrete manifestation of supporting the general line and realizing the general line. The soldiers expressed their determination to increase vigilance and be loyal to their duties, so that the motherland can safely build socialism.
    The study of the general line has also promoted the ongoing movement of cherishing the motherland's property and practicing economy in the troops, and increased the enthusiasm of cadres to subscribe to the 1954 national economic construction bonds. After receiving the propaganda and education of the general line, many cadres and soldiers wrote letters to mobilize their families to sell their surplus grain to the state and participate in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. After studying the general line, the people's armed cadres in the coastal areas of Guangdong went deep into the countryside, organized militia, strengthened coastal patrols, and stopped unscrupulous merchants from smuggling grain.

    Xinhua News Agency: The leadership organs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are vigorously publicizing the general line and general task of the country during the transition period to commanders and fighters before and after the New Year.
    Before and after the New Year, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army convened cadre conferences one after another to mobilize the study of the general line and general task of the country during the transition period. The responsible cadres of many troops went deep into the company to give lessons to the soldiers. In order to better lead the company's study, some troops also transferred a group of cadres for short-term training to cultivate them as core members in the study. The literary and art work troupes and teams of various troops also compiled allegro, drum music and small song and dance dramas based on the spirit of the general line, and prepared to perform for the troops. A certain unit on the eastern front also set up a propaganda broadcasting station in the驻地, and used loudspeakers to publicize the general line and general task of the country during the transition period to the troops every day, reporting the news that factories and mines across the country had completed or overfulfilled the 1953 production plan. These news were as welcomed by the soldiers as the victory news in the battle. The Volunteer Army guarding the east coast distributed books and pictorials about the construction of the motherland in the library to various companies and organized the soldiers to read. Some troops' clubs cut out pictures about the industrialization of the motherland and posted them on the wall for the soldiers to read. Art workers in the army also painted many wall charts to help the company carry out education. Many troops used weekend evenings to conduct casual talks and Q&A on the general line of the country during the transition period. Some soldiers also recited their family letters and letters of condolences from workers, farmers, and students from all over the country to illustrate the achievements of the motherland's construction and the correctness of the general line of the country during the transition period. The film projection teams in the army selected films about the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, such as "Donbass Miners", "Virgin Land Reclaimed", "Light Shines on the Village of Keoldi", and "The Visit of the Chinese Farmers Delegation to the Soviet Union", and screened them separately at each report meeting.
    Some of the troops guarding the central line also exhibited pictures of the motherland's great construction projects. Yang Guangbo, a soldier of a certain unit on the Tieyuan front, took out the pictures and letters of the production situation of the Dongxin Farm in northern Jiangsu sent by his fiancée, labor model Jiang Xingzhen, from the Dongxin Farm in northern Jiangsu to be exhibited in the company. The picture reads: "State-owned farms are the locomotives that guide farmers to collectivization."
    The cadres and fighters of the Volunteer Army are taking practical actions to support the general line of the country during the transition period. They are guarding their positions more vigilantly, making efforts to launch a patriotic and economical movement, and many cadres and fighters are encouraging relatives and friends in the countryside to sell their surplus grain to the country and take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation by writing letters and other means. Jia Wanmin, a third-class merit and member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League whose family is in Taiyuan, Shanxi, said in his letter to his father Jia Luxi: If we want to live a happier life and cultivate the land with tractors, we should actively respond to the call of the country, sell the surplus grain to the country, help the country carry out socialist industrialization, and participate in agricultural production cooperatives. Soldier Ye Mingchao's brother Ye Hanqing wrote to him from Shibao Village, Tongliang County, Sichuan: This year, the family harvested twenty stones of grain, and has sold more than 1,900 catties of surplus grain to the country, and deposited all the money from the sale into the national bank. Ye Mingchao was very happy to read the letter. In his reply to his brother, he said: "I am honored to have such a brother. I hope you will always maintain this spirit and help the villagers more. In order to make the happy life of socialism come sooner, we should do everything we can to help the country."

    中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军各部队
    大张旗鼓地宣传过渡时期总路线
    中国人民解放军陆、海、空军各部队各机关、各学校大张旗鼓地向广大干部、战士宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线，这一普遍深入的宣传教育运动，提高了干部和战士的社会主义思想。
    在大张旗鼓宣传总路线以前，各部队都作了充分的准备。为了便于领导所属部队在今年一年中系统地学习总路线，各兵种、各部队的中共党委都先后成立了中心学习小组，各领导机关也成立了高级学习班。有的部队举办高级干部集训班，提早学习总路线。东北军区、华北军区、中南军区、空军等政治部都先后举办集训班，训练了大批学习总路线的领导干部和骨干分子。
    新年前，各部队普遍地开始宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线。各部队首长首先亲自作了国家在过渡时期总路线的传达报告，中南军区代司令员叶剑英、西南军区副政治委员宋任穷、东北军区副政治委员张秀山、海军副司令员罗舜初等都在干部会上作了传达报告。各部普遍召开大会，作报告，上课，组织讨论；许多单位还以实地参观和形象教学等方式辅助总路线的宣传教育，组织干部、战士参观工厂、农场，邀请工农业劳动模范作报告等。西北军区各部队从去年十二月起，开始放映“幸福的生活”、“顿巴斯矿工”、“成渝铁路”等四十多部影片，帮助干部和战士学习总路线。福建军区各部队俱乐部、图书馆都出了专刊，并介绍许多参考书供大家阅读。各部队的有线广播，经常播送人民日报和部队报纸上有关总路线的文章。有些部队还展览和放映了介绍我国经济建设和苏联社会主义工业化情形的图片和幻灯。有的部队还引用驻地工农业生产的生动的材料，具体解释总路线的内容。为达到人人皆知总路线，有的部队组织了工作组深入驻在边疆的部队宣传，各部队还都注意了对外出人员的补课。山东军区后勤部还派出专人到医院、供应站等分驻在各地的机关、部队去宣传总路线。现在连驻在远离祖国大陆的海南岛的战士们，也都已知道总路线的基本内容了。
    经初步学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线后，干部和战士们说：过渡时期的总路线把我们的心照亮了，应该更加努力工作和学习，努力保卫祖国建设。“建设社会主义社会不能等待”成了大家行动起来的口号，大家工作和学习的情绪愈加高涨了。在军事训练中，干部、战士不怕天寒地冻，认真操练，积极学习苏联先进军事科学和军事技术。守卫在边防、海防的战士，听了总路线的传达报告后，都能把自己的职责和总路线联系起来。他们明确了保卫边防、海防，就是拥护总路线和实现总路线的具体表现。战士们纷纷表示要提高警惕，忠于职守，使祖国安全地建设社会主义。
    总路线的学习还推动了部队正在进行的爱护祖国资财和厉行节约的运动，提高了干部认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债的热情。许多干部和战士在受到了总路线的宣传教育后，纷纷写信动员家属将余粮卖给国家和参加互助组、农业生产合作社。广东沿海地区的人民武装干部在学了总路线后，便深入乡村，组织民兵，加强沿海巡逻，杜绝奸商偷运粮食。（新华社）
    中国人民志愿军各部队领导机关在新年前后大张旗鼓地向指挥员、战斗员们宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。
    新年前后，中国人民志愿军各部队都先后召开了干部大会，动员学习国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。许多部队的负责干部并深入连队给战士们上课。有些部队为了更好地领导连队学习还抽调了一批干部进行短期集训，培养他们成为学习中的骨干分子。各部队的文艺工作团、文艺工作队也根据总路线的精神编排了快板、大鼓和小型歌舞剧，准备向部队演出。东线某部并在驻地设立了宣传广播站，每天用扩音机向部队宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，报告祖国各工厂、矿山完成或超额完成一九五三年生产计划的消息。这些消息也像战斗中的胜利消息一样，受到了战士们的欢迎。守卫在东海岸的志愿军部队，把图书馆中有关祖国建设的书籍、画报分发到各连队去，组织战士们阅读。有些部队的俱乐部，将有关祖国工业化的图片剪下来贴在墙上，供连队战士阅览。部队中的美术工作者还绘制了许多挂图，帮助连队进行教育。许多部队都利用周末晚会来进行国家在过渡时期的总路线的漫谈和问答，有的战士还诵读了他们的家信和祖国各地工人、农民、学生的慰问信，来说明祖国建设的成就和国家在过渡时期的总路线的正确。部队中的电影放映队选择了有关苏联社会主义建设的影片，如“顿巴斯矿工”、“被开垦的处女地”、“光明照耀到克奥尔地村”、“中国农民代表团访苏经过”等，在各次报告大会上分别放映。
    守卫在中线的某些部队，还展览了祖国各项伟大建设工程的图片。铁原前线某部战士杨广波，把他的未婚妻、劳动模范蒋兴珍从江苏北部东辛农场寄来的该农场生产情形的图片和信件拿出来在连队展览。图片上写着：“国营农场是引导农民走上集体化的火车头”。
    志愿军各部队的干部战士纷纷用实际行动来拥护国家在过渡时期的总路线。他们更加警惕地守卫着阵地，努力展开爱国节约运动，许多干部战士通过写信等方式鼓励在农村中的亲戚朋友把余粮卖给国家，走互助合作的道路。家在山西太原的三等功臣、中国新民主主义青年团团员贾万民给他父亲贾禄善的信中说：我们要想过更幸福的生活，用拖拉机耕地，就应该积极响应国家号召，把剩余的粮食卖给国家，帮助国家进行社会主义工业化建设，并参加农业生产合作社。战士叶明超的哥哥叶汉卿从四川铜梁县石堡村来信告诉他：今年家里收了二十石粮食，已把余粮一千九百多斤卖给了国家，并把卖的钱全部存入国家银行。叶明超看了信非常高兴。他在给他哥哥的回信上说：“我有这样的哥哥感到光荣，希望你永远保持这种精神，并多多帮助乡亲们。为了使社会主义的幸福生活早日到来，我们应当尽我们的一切力量帮助国家。”
