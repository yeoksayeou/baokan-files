Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 9th: The U.S. side, through its propaganda machine, is intensifying its threats and intimidation against India, attempting to force it to agree to the U.S. side's actions of violating the "Terms of Reference" and forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war according to a predetermined timetable.

The U.S. side is now openly spreading the rumor that if India does not comply with the U.S. plan, it will dispatch Syngman Rhee's puppet troops or even mobilize U.S. troops to deal with the Indian custodial forces. While U.S. Eighth Army Commander Taylor and U.S. Far East Commander Hull were in Tokyo to discuss the plan to plunder prisoners of war, the U.S. side instructed the Pan-Asia News Agency, which has close ties with the U.S. Far East Command, to issue a message from Tokyo stating: "Undoubtedly, the two men's discussion will take into account the possibility that if the Indian custodial forces do not release the prisoners of war on the stipulated date, Korea will use force and bloodshed and gunfire in the prisoner-of-war camps to release the prisoners of war; at the same time, it will also estimate how many troops from the Eighth Army should be dispatched to protect the freedom of the prisoners of war if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission decides to continue to guard the prisoners of war."

The U.S.'s other propaganda machine, the Associated Press, is preparing to create major "news" about Syngman Rhee's puppet troops entering the neutral camp to forcibly "release" prisoners of war. An internal memo sent by the Associated Press to its Tokyo branch on the 6th stated: "We now need undated dispatches or communications on how South Korean troops will enter the Panmunjom camp on January 23." The memo instructed to focus on describing how Syngman Rhee's troops "will enter the neutral zone from the central or eastern front, and then cross the U.S. and Communist positions from the side, or will cross Korea from the side behind the U.S. defense line from the main supply line controlled by the United States to the Munsan-Panmunjom area?" The Associated Press wants its fabrication experts to copy this topic exactly, apparently not only to conduct "psychological warfare" against the Indian custodial forces, but also to shirk the responsibility of the U.S. side instructing Syngman Rhee to plunder prisoners of war by force under the pretext of so-called "Syngman Rhee's puppet troops crossing the U.S. positions from the side."

At the same time, the official United States Information Service forwarded the editorial of the American ruling group's newspaper, the "New York Herald Tribune," on the 7th, directly putting pressure on the Indian government. This editorial blatantly demanded that India comply with the American plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war. It said that if it did not, India would "fall into a trap." It said that the American attitude is: The issue of "releasing" prisoners of war "must be resolved within two and a half weeks, specifically by midnight on January 22. It is sincerely hoped that Prime Minister (Nehru) does not underestimate the extreme seriousness of this issue." It threatened that if India did not agree, India would "directly assume the responsibility it does not welcome," and "(India) the Prime Minister must see this point."

### 美方加紧胁迫印度顺从它劫夺战俘的计划

    美方加紧胁迫印度顺从它劫夺战俘的计划
    【新华社开城九日电】美方通过其宣传机器正在变本加厉地对印度施行威胁恫吓，企图迫使它同意美方破坏“职权范围”、按照预定时间表来强迫扣留朝中战俘的行动。
    美方现在公然散布空气，表示如果印度不适应美方的计划，就将出动李承晚伪军甚至调动美军来对付印度看管部队。在美国第八军军长泰勒和远东美军总司令赫尔在东京会商劫夺战俘计划的时候，美方指使与远东美军司令部有密切关系的泛亚社从东京发出消息说：“无疑地，两人的讨论中将估计到这种可能性：如果印度看管部队没有在规定的日期释放战俘，朝鲜将用武力及在战俘营中流血与开枪的手段释放战俘；同时也将估计，如果中立国遣返委员会决定继续看管战俘，应该派第八军的多少兵力去保护战俘的自由。”
    美方的另一个宣传机器合众社正准备大事制造关于李承晚伪军将开进中立国营场以武力“释放”战俘的“新闻”。合众社六日发往东京分社的内部通报说：“现需要不注明日期的关于韩国军队将如何在一月二十三日开进板门店营场的电讯或通讯。”通报指示要着意描述李承晚部队究竟“将从中线或东线进入中立区，然后从侧面越过美军及共军阵地呢，还是将从美国控制的主要供应线上直到汶山—板门店地区的美国防线背后从侧面横过朝鲜呢？”合众社要它的造谣专家在这个题目上照单炮制，显然不仅是要为了对印度看管部队进行“心理战”，而且是要在所谓李伪军“侧面越过美军阵地”的饰词下推卸美方指使李承晚以武力劫夺战俘的责任。
    与此同时，官方的美国新闻处七日转发美国统治集团的报纸“纽约先驱论坛报”的社论，对印度政府直接使用压力。这篇社论露骨地要求印度顺从美国强迫扣留战俘的计划。它说，如果不是这样，印度就要“落入陷阱”。它说，美国的态度是：“释放”战俘的问题“必须在两个半星期内解决，具体的就是在一月二十二日午夜解决。人们诚恳地希望（尼赫鲁）总理不是低估这个问题的极端严重性”。它威胁说，如果印度不同意，印度就将“直接负起它所不欢迎的责任”，“（印度）总理必须看到这一点”。
