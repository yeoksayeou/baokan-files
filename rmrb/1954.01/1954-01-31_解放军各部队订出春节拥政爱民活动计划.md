　　PLA Units Formulate Spring Festival Support-the-Government and Cherish-the-People Activity Plans

    All units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have formulated specific plans and measures for launching support-the-government and cherish-the-people activities during the Spring Festival. The directly subordinate organs and troops of the Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, and other provincial military regions under the Northeast Military Region have successively held joint meetings with the local provincial and municipal people's governments, coordinating with local work to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, and formulated specific measures for support-the-government and cherish-the-people activities. The organs and troops of the Northeast Military Region stationed in Shenyang have also formulated specific plans for support-the-government and cherish-the-people activities. The Shenyang-based organs of the Logistics Department of the Military Region and the Shenyang-based units of the Public Security Forces and the Garrison Forces will hold Spring Festival military-government-civilian get-togethers and symposiums. Many units will invite local model workers in industry and agriculture to visit the troops during the Spring Festival, hold discussions with heroes of the troops, and invite model workers to report to the troops on the brilliant achievements of the country's various construction undertakings. Many units of the North China Military Region plan to invite local responsible cadres to report to the troops on the work of giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs during the Spring Festival, and to extend regards to local families of revolutionary martyrs, families of military personnel, and demobilized soldiers. The Beijing-based units of the North China Military Region also plan to cooperate with the People's Government to organize a large-scale garden party. The vast coastal defense forces of the East China Military Region, while maintaining high alert and guarding the coast, are also rehearsing cultural and entertainment programs to prepare for get-togethers with local militiamen, fishermen, and farmers. The troops who participated in the Dongshan Island battle are also preparing to organize a慰问团 (consolation group) to extend regards to the people of Dongshan Island and thank them for their support to the troops. The army, navy, and air force units of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai have established a joint office for Spring Festival support-the-government and cherish-the-people work, which will systematically and universally hold various get-together activities with workers, suburban farmers, and people from all walks of life.
    The PLA units are also preparing to publicize the general line of the state during the transition period in the course of launching support-the-government and cherish-the-people activities. The Central South Military Region plans to conduct in-depth propaganda and education on military-civilian unity and jointly striving to realize the country's general line during the transition period through support-the-government and cherish-the-people activities during the Spring Festival. The North China Military Region units also plan to launch support-the-government and cherish-the-people activities in conjunction with the publicity of the country's general line during the transition period.
