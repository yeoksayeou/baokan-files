Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 8th: Our correspondent reports: UN Commander-in-Chief Hull today expressed his determination to implement his "timetable" for forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Today, he published his reply to Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) Chairman Thimayya's letter and memorandum of January 2nd. Hull completely refused to consider the NNRC's opinion in the memorandum that "the extension of the explanation period is legal and necessary" and that "explanations should continue." He brazenly claimed that the U.S. side "cannot consider restarting or continuing the explanation work to the prisoners of war under the NNRC's custody." He also distorted the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," continuing to insist that "the responsibility of the Indian Custodial Force for guarding prisoners of war terminates at the first minute of January 23, 1954 (one minute after midnight on January 22nd)." He wants the Indian Custodial Force to start withdrawing after January 22nd, claiming that it is enough for only a part of the Indian troops to remain in the demilitarized zone. He even pressured the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Force to act as his assistants in forcibly detaining prisoners of war, saying that "at that time, the Commission also has the clear responsibility to release prisoners of war," which is truly the height of shamelessness.

The NNRC pointed out in its memorandum: "Submitting the issue of the future of the non-repatriated prisoners of war to the political conference is mandatory." However, Hull kicked aside the armistice agreement, arbitrarily saying: "Convening the political conference is only a suggestion made by the commanders of both sides to their respective governments." He meant that the political conference could not be held. This proves once again that the U.S. government is fundamentally unwilling to hold a political conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Therefore, he openly disregarded the explicit provisions of the "Terms of Reference," stubbornly claiming that convening the political conference "has no decisive relationship with the issue of prisoners of war under the custody of the NNRC." He made no secret of the U.S. side's purpose in sabotaging the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, which was to avoid discussing the POW issue at the political conference in order to realize its conspiracy to forcibly detain POWs. He said that convening a political conference before January 22nd, the date the U.S. side plans to seize prisoners of war, is "extremely unlikely." He attempted to attribute this to the "attitude adopted" by the Korean and Chinese sides in the bilateral talks, but everyone knows that the attitude of the Korean and Chinese sides in the talks was very serious and upright, and that the bilateral talks were abruptly and groundlessly interrupted by the U.S. side after it had exhausted all its shameless means. Therefore, the U.S. side cannot escape responsibility for sabotaging the talks.

Hull distorted the provisions of paragraph 11 of the "Terms of Reference," saying that the "obvious purpose" of this paragraph is to "prevent either party to the agreement from undermining the basic purpose of avoiding indefinite detention of prisoners of war simply by refusing to attend (political) meetings or agreeing to any other handling methods at the meetings." Hull's distortion precisely proves that the U.S. side sabotaged the bilateral talks, delayed the convening of the political conference, and insisted on "releasing" prisoners of war before the political conference because it feared that the handling of prisoners of war discussed at the political conference would be detrimental to the "basic purpose" of the U.S. side in forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Precisely for this reason, the U.S. side stubbornly insisted on severing paragraph 11 of the "Terms of Reference," on the one hand, desperately clinging to the clause on "releasing" prisoners of war after one hundred and twenty days, and on the other hand, throwing the provisions on ninety days of explanation and the submission of the POW issue to the political conference to the winds.

Hull's letter once again shows that the U.S. side completely despises the Korean Armistice Agreement and the NNRC's interpretation of the "Terms of Reference." The sole purpose of this letter is obviously to shut the door on resolving the POW issue, pressuring the NNRC to abandon its fair position, thereby making the "Terms of Reference" a complete scrap of paper.

    赫尔复信蒂迈雅拒绝考虑延长解释期限
    显然要关死解决战俘问题大门强扣战俘
    【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者报道：联合国军总司令赫尔今天表示决心实行他的强迫扣留战俘的“时间表”。他在今天发表了他对于中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅一月二日的信和备忘录的答复。赫尔完全拒绝考虑中立国遣返委员会在备忘录中提出的“解释期限的延长是合法和必要的”，“解释应予继续”的意见。他横蛮无理地声称，美方“不能考虑重新开始或继续进行对在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘的解释工作”。他并且曲解“职权范围”的规定，继续一口咬定“印度看管部队看管战俘的责任在一九五四年一月二十三日第一分钟（一月二十二日午夜后一分钟）即告终止”。他要印度看管部队在一月二十二日以后就开始撤退，声称只要有一部分印度部队可以继续留在非军事区就够了。他居然还要压迫中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队给他充当强迫扣留战俘的助手，说什么“到那个时候，委员会还有明确的责任来释放战俘”，这真是无赖到了极点。
    中立国遣返委员会在其备忘录中指出：“将未遣返战俘的前途问题提交政治会议，这是有强制性的。”可是赫尔却一脚踢开停战协定，专断地说：“召开政治会议只是双方司令官向各该国政府提出的一项建议”，他的意思是政治会议可以不开。这又证明美国政府根本是不愿意举行政治会议来和平解决朝鲜问题的。因此，他公然无视“职权范围”的明文规定，硬说召开政治会议“这件事与在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘的问题没有决定性的关系。”他毫不掩饰美方破坏关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的目的，就是在于避免在政治会议上讨论战俘问题，以便实现其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。他说，在美方预定劫夺战俘的日期一月二十二日之前，召开政治会议是“极不可能的事情”。他企图把这归咎于朝中方面在双方会谈中“所采取的态度”，但是谁都知道朝中方面在会谈中的态度是十分严正的，而双方会谈是美方在要尽无赖手段以后悍然毫无理由地中断的，因此美方破坏会谈的责任是绝对逃脱不了的。
    赫尔曲解“职权范围”第十一款的规定，说什么这一款的“明显目的就是要防止协议的任何一方单纯以拒绝参加（政治）会议或在会议上同意任何其他处理办法等方式，而破坏避免无限期拘留战俘的基本目的”。赫尔这种曲解，恰恰证明美方所以破坏双方会谈，拖延政治会议的召开，并坚持在政治会议召开前“释放”战俘，就是因为害怕政治会议讨论出来的处理战俘的办法，不利于美方强迫扣留战俘的“基本目的”。正是因此，美方才顽固地坚持割裂“职权范围”第十一款，一方面死命抓住关于一百二十天后“释放”战俘的条文不放，另一方面却把关于应有九十天的解释以及应将战俘问题提交政治会议讨论的规定抛到九霄云外。
    赫尔的信再次表明，美方完全蔑视朝鲜停战协定，蔑视中立国遣返委员会对于“职权范围”的解释。这封信的唯一目的，显然是要关死解决战俘问题的大门，压迫中立国遣返委员会放弃其公正的立场，从而使“职权范围”完全成为一张废纸。
