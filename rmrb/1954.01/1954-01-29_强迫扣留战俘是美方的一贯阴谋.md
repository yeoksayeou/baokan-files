Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 28th: A special correspondent of this agency reports: The US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war at the cost of nearly 140,000 US military casualties has reached its climax with the US side's sabotage of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the forced detention of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in the Tongjang-ni POW camp.

Forcibly detaining prisoners of war is a consistent conspiracy of the US side. The main purpose of this conspiracy is to forcibly detain a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war as capital for "Cold War" propaganda, creating the lie that prisoners of war are willing to stay in the so-called "free world" and would "rather commit suicide than return home," in order to conceal the unjust nature of the US's war of aggression in Korea and its unprecedented failure. In order to achieve this goal, the US extended the Korean war, which could have ended in early 1952, until July 1953, making nearly 140,000 American youths the victims of this shameful policy.

This conspiracy took shape before the start of the Korean armistice negotiations in July 1951, when US intelligence agencies conducted large-scale activities in the POW camps, interrogating and investigating the prisoners of war. After the start of the armistice negotiations, the US intensified the creation of so-called "refusal to repatriate" prisoners of war on Geoje Island. Under the command of the US military intelligence agencies "CIC," "G-2," and "CIE," a large number of Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee bandit gang agents controlled the entire POW camp. They forced prisoners of war to join reactionary organizations and receive reactionary education. In order to instill fear in the prisoners of war about returning home, barbaric methods of tattooing and writing blood letters were carried out on a large scale in the POW camps. Many prisoners of war were tattooed after being knocked unconscious by the agents, or had their fingerprints stamped. Any prisoner of war who showed resistance was subjected to cruel torture and even murder. These atrocities by the US side turned Geoje Island into an "Island of Terror," and the Geoje Island POW camp became a death camp far exceeding the Nazi concentration camps.

After such preparations, when the issue of prisoners of war was brought to the agenda of the armistice negotiations in December 1951, the US side put forward unreasonable demands that violated all international law, such as "one-for-one exchange," "voluntary repatriation," "civilians replacing prisoners of war," and "classifying prisoners of war as civilians," openly stating that it would forcibly detain a large number of captured Korean and Chinese personnel. The Korean and Chinese sides resolutely opposed these absurd demands of the US side, insisted on repatriating all prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention, and exposed the US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war based on a large number of facts.

After putting forward the absurd proposal of "voluntary repatriation," the US side conducted illegal so-called "screenings" in their POW camps, forcing prisoners of war to express "refusal to repatriate," and taking a series of bloody massacres against those who did not submit to the US's will. Some of these massacre cases have become known to the world through the US's tight news blockade. For example, on February 18, 1952, in order to forcibly classify and detain the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army in POW Camp No. 62 on Geoje Island as civilians, the US side attacked the prisoners of war with a regiment of troops, killing and wounding more than 370 prisoners of war. Even the "International Committee of the Red Cross" in Geneva, which has always whitewashed the US side, could not but acknowledge this shocking atrocity by the US side.

In April 1952, the US side implemented a large-scale bloody "screening" in the Geoje Island POW camp, even killing prisoners of war who demanded repatriation and displaying their hearts and livers to intimidate and coerce prisoners of war, making them afraid to demand repatriation. At the same time, the US side put forward a so-called "firm, final, and unchangeable" plan at the negotiating table, attempting to only repatriate 70,000 prisoners of war to the Korean and Chinese side, while forcibly detaining approximately 100,000 prisoners of war. The US side also shamelessly claimed that this was the result of their "individual investigations" of the prisoners of war, saying that the prisoners of war they wanted to detain were all those who would "rather commit suicide than return home."

However, the Dudde incident exposed all the lies of the US side. The confessions made by Dudde and his successor, Colson, completely bankrupted the lie of "voluntary repatriation," and even the bourgeois public opinion in the United States and Britain could not but admit this. The British "Reynold News" once said: "After the Dudde and Colson incidents, people will no longer believe the American claim that prisoners of war do not want to return to their homeland."

Enraged by the exposure of their conspiracy, the American aggressors carried out an even larger-scale bloody suppression of the prisoners of war. From May to June 1952, under the command of the notorious executioner Boatner, the US military launched a series of massacres against unarmed prisoners of war. The massacre of prisoners of war in Camp No. 76 on Geoje Island on June 10 alone killed and wounded more than 320 prisoners of war.

After carrying out this series of massacres and dispersing the prisoners of war for further control, the US side put forward a so-called "firm, final, and unchangeable" plan to only repatriate 83,000 people at the armistice negotiation conference table, forcing the Korean and Chinese side to accept it. When this absurd plan was refuted by the Korean and Chinese side, the US side took the unilateral action of "releasing" prisoners of war, handing over 38,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to the Syngman Rhee bandit gang between June and October 1952. The witness testimony later obtained by the Korean and Chinese side proved that all these prisoners of war were incorporated into the Rhee puppet army by the Syngman Rhee bandit gang.

In October 1952, the US side unilaterally interrupted the armistice negotiations, attempting to force the Korean and Chinese side to accept its conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war through military adventures and the Seventh United Nations General Assembly. But these attempts all failed. After crushing the US side's military adventures, the Korean and Chinese side, based on its consistent policy of seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, made major efforts again, putting forward suggestions for resolving the prisoner of war issue on March 30, 1953, that is, both sides should guarantee the immediate repatriation after the armistice of all prisoners of war they hold who insist on repatriation, and transfer the remaining prisoners of war to neutral countries so that the Korean and Chinese side can send people to explain to them and dispel the fear caused by the US side's long-term persecution, thereby ensuring a just resolution of their repatriation issue. The Korean and Chinese side's proposal was welcomed by the world. Under the pressure of world public opinion, the US side had no choice but to return to Panmunjom in April 1953 and sign the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" on June 8 on the basis of the Korean and Chinese side's proposal.

The basic purpose of the "Terms of Reference" is to "ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice." According to the "Terms of Reference," within 60 days after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement, all prisoners of war falsely claimed by the US side as "refusing repatriation" should be released from the control of the US side and handed over to a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission composed of representatives from five neutral countries for custody, and the country to which the prisoners of war belong should explain to the prisoners of war for 90 days regarding their repatriation matters, in order to ensure that they exercise their right to be repatriated. The issue of how to handle prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated after the 90-day explanation period should be discussed and resolved by the political conference held after the armistice within 30 days. Prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated after the political conference discussion and for whom the political conference has still not agreed on a solution should be released as civilians by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and those who apply to go to neutral countries should be assisted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to go there within another 30 days.

The Korean and Chinese side agreed to take the steps stipulated in the "Terms of Reference" in order to resolve the prisoner of war issue as soon as possible and stop the bloodshed in Korea as soon as possible. Therefore, while adhering to principles, the Korean and Chinese side made concessions in the method, steps, and time for resolving the prisoner of war issue. The Korean and Chinese side firmly believes that there are no so-called "refusing repatriation" prisoners of war. Due to the US side's implementation of more than three years of terror rule over the prisoners of war, many prisoners of war have been intimidated and oppressed by the US side, and are fearful and dare not demand repatriation. As long as these prisoners of war are freed from the control of the US side, and after the explanation by the Korean and Chinese side, their fear can be dispelled and their repatriation issue can be reasonably resolved. Therefore, lifting the US side's terrorist control over the prisoners of war and allowing the prisoners of war to have the freedom and sufficient time to listen to the explanation is a necessary prerequisite for ensuring that the prisoners of war exercise their right to be repatriated. The reason why the Korean and Chinese side suggested handing over the prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the reason why the "Terms of Reference" were signed, were all to achieve this goal.

The US side agreed to the "Terms of Reference" out of compulsion. The thorough implementation of the "Terms of Reference" would inevitably lead to the complete bankruptcy of the US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Therefore, before the signing of the "Terms of Reference," the US side requested that all captured personnel of the Korean People's Army be "released" in South Korea at the time the armistice took effect. This absurd and outrageous demand was unanimously condemned by world public opinion, forcing the US side to withdraw it. After being forced to accept the "Terms of Reference" under the pressure of public opinion, the US side tried every means to sabotage it. Ten days after the agreement was signed, the US side perfidiously condoned Syngman Rhee to rob more than 27,000 prisoners of war from the POW camp, causing the bloody war in Korea to be extended for more than a month. Then the US side strengthened the intelligence terror organization in its POW camp, intensified the control of prisoners of war with violence, and sent this entire set of intelligence organizations to the Tongjang-ni POW camp intact.

After handing over the prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, the US side initially deliberately delayed the construction of explanation tents, delaying the start of the Korean and Chinese side's explanation work; then, through various channels, it used the US military's 64th Field Hospital it provided as the center to direct agents to sabotage the explanation work. These agents prevented prisoners of war from coming out to listen to the explanation, used shocking terrorist methods to prevent prisoners of war from repatriating, and even savagely murdered prisoners of war who demanded repatriation. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission completely confirmed all these crimes of the US side in its "Interim Report" submitted to both sides on December 28, 1953. Due to the US side's sabotage, the Korean and Chinese side's explanation work only lasted for ten days, and more than 85% of the prisoners of war failed to listen to the explanation.

Even so, more than 600 prisoners of war broke free from the control of the agents and demanded repatriation. The crimes of the US side in forcibly detaining prisoners of war that they exposed at Panmunjom further and completely bankrupted the US side's lie that these prisoners of war would "rather commit suicide than return home." The American authorities, enraged out of shame, intensified their sabotage of the explanation work and unilaterally announced the termination of the explanation on December 23 of last year, demanding that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission allow it to forcibly detain prisoners of war on January 23, otherwise it would forcibly rob the prisoners of war by force.

In order to avoid discussing the prisoner of war issue at the political conference, the US side tried its best to delay the convening of the political conference, unilaterally interrupting the bilateral talks on the political conference issue on December 12, 1953, in order to facilitate the realization of its conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

The Korean and Chinese side and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission both opposed the US side's behavior of sabotaging the implementation of the "Terms of Reference," and advocated continuing the explanation in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," supplementing the 90-day explanation period, and advocated that the prisoner of war issue should be discussed and resolved by the political conference. However, the Indian chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission did not exercise the legal powers granted to the commission in accordance with the "Terms of Reference," but instead unilaterally made a decision that violated the "Terms of Reference," returning more than 21,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to the US side from January 20, which facilitated the realization of the US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

The American aggressors' conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war has made the whole world see more clearly that US imperialism is the most decadent, most barbaric, and most untrustworthy imperialism. For the sake of the "Cold War" interests, in order to continue to maintain tension in Korea and prevent the Korean issue from being resolved peacefully, it openly tears up all international law and the agreements it personally signed, adopts methods that are intolerable to humanity and justice, making it impossible for thousands of prisoners of war to return to their hometowns and motherland, forcing them to become cannon fodder for the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs. The American aggressors' removal of prisoners of war from the Korean demilitarized zone can only make it fail more thoroughly politically and morally.

### 强迫扣留战俘是美方的一贯阴谋

　　强迫扣留战俘是美方的一贯阴谋
    【新华社开城二十八日电】本社特派记者报道：以将近十四万名美军士兵的伤亡为代价的美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，随着美方破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”、强迫扣留东场里战俘营中的朝中战俘而发展到了顶点。
    强迫扣留战俘是美方的一贯阴谋。这个阴谋的主要目的，就是企图强迫扣留一大批朝中战俘来作为“冷战”宣传的资本，制造战俘愿意留在所谓“自由世界”、“宁愿自杀也不愿回家”的谎言，借以掩饰美国在朝鲜进行的侵略战争的非正义性质及其所遭到的空前失败。为了达到这个目的，美方使本来在一九五二年初就可以结束的朝鲜的流血战争一直延长到一九五三年七月，使将近十四万名美国青年充当了这个可耻政策的牺牲品。
    这个阴谋在一九五一年七月朝鲜停战谈判开始之前就已经形成，当时美方的特务机关就在战俘营中进行了大规模的活动，对战俘进行审讯和调查。停战谈判开始以后，美方在巨济岛上加紧制造所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘。在美军特务机关“CIC”、“G—2”“CIE”的指挥之下，大批国民党和李承晚匪帮的特务分子控制了整个战俘营，他们强迫战俘参加反动组织，接受反动教育。为了使战俘对于回家心存疑惧，野蛮的刺字、写血书的手段在战俘营里大规模地进行，许多战俘在被打昏过去以后，被特务在身上刺了字，或者被拉着手指盖上了指印。任何表示反抗的战俘都要遭到残酷的拷打甚至杀害。美方的这种暴行使巨济岛成了“恐怖之岛”，而巨济岛战俘营则成了远远超过纳粹集中营的死亡营。
    经过这样的准备以后，当战俘问题在一九五一年十二月被提到停战谈判的议事日程上来的时候，美方就提出了所谓“一对一交换”、“自愿遣返”、“平民顶替战俘”、“将战俘分类为平民”等等违反一切国际公法的无理主张，公然表示要强迫扣留大批朝中被俘人员。朝中方面坚决反对美方的这种荒谬要求，主张按照日内瓦公约遣返全部战俘，并且根据大量的事实，揭露了美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。
    美方在提出荒谬的“自愿遣返”的主张以后，就在他们的战俘营里进行了非法的所谓“甄别”，强迫战俘表示“拒绝遣返”，并对那些不屈从美方意旨的战俘采取了一连串的血腥屠杀。其中某些屠杀案已经透过美方严密的新闻封锁而为世所周知。例如一九五二年二月十八日，美方为了把巨济岛六十二号战俘营中的朝鲜人民军被俘人员强迫分类为平民而加以扣留，以一个团的兵力进攻战俘，打死打伤战俘三百七十多人。甚至一贯替美方粉饰门面的日内瓦的“红十字国际委员会”，也不能不承认了美方的这一骇人听闻的暴行。
      一九五二年四月，美方在巨济岛战俘营中实行大规模的血腥“甄别”，甚至杀死要求遣返的战俘，挖出心肝示众，借以恫吓和胁迫战俘，使他们不敢要求遣返。同时，美方又在谈判桌上提出了一个所谓“坚定的、最后的、不可改变的”方案，企图只遣返给朝中方面七万名战俘，而将大约十万名的战俘加以强迫扣留。美方还无耻地宣称这是他们对战俘进行了“个别调查”的结果，说什么他们要加以扣留的战俘都是“宁愿自杀也不愿回家”的。
    但是随着发生的杜德事件揭穿了美方的一切谎言。杜德和他的继任者柯尔生所作的供状，使“自愿遣返”的谎话彻底破产，甚至美国和英国的资产阶级舆论也不能不承认这一点。英国的“雷诺新闻”就曾经说：“杜德与柯尔生事件发生以后，人们不会再相信美国所谓战俘不愿回他们祖国的说法了。”
    由于阴谋被揭穿而恼羞成怒的美国侵略者，对战俘进行了更大规模的血腥镇压。从一九五二年五月到六月，在臭名远扬的刽子手波纳的指挥之下，美军对手无寸铁的战俘发动了一连串的屠杀。仅仅其中六月十日对巨济岛七十六号营场战俘的屠杀，就打死打伤战俘三百二十多人。
    在进行了这一系列的屠杀并且把战俘分散以便进一步控制以后，美方又在停战谈判会议桌上提出一个只遣返八万三千人的所谓“坚定的、最后的、不可改变的”方案，强迫朝中方面接受。当这个荒谬方案遭到朝中方面驳斥的时候，美方就采取“释放”战俘的片面行动，在一九五二年六月到十月之间将三万八千名朝鲜人民军被俘人员交给李承晚匪帮，朝中方面后来获得的人证证明：这些战俘全部被李承晚匪帮编入了李伪军。
    一九五二年十月，美方片面中断了停战谈判，企图通过军事冒险和第七届联合国大会来迫使朝中方面接受其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。但是这些企图都失败了。朝中方面在粉碎了美方的军事冒险之后，本其一贯谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的政策，又作了重大的努力，在一九五三年三月三十日提出了解决战俘问题的建议，即双方应保证在停战后立即遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余的战俘转交中立国，以便朝中方面派人对他们进行解释，解除他们在美方的长期迫害之下所造成的疑惧，从而保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。朝中方面的建议受到全世界的欢迎。在世界舆论的压力之下，美方才不得不在一九五三年四月回到板门店，并在朝中方面的建议的基础上在六月八日签订了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”。
    “职权范围”的基本目的，就是为了“保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利”。根据“职权范围”，在停战协定签字生效以后的六十天之内，所有被美方谎称为“拒绝遣返”的战俘，应该解除美方的控制，交给一个由五个中立国家的代表组成的中立国遣返委员会看管，并由战俘所属的国家向战俘进行九十天的解释，告诉他们有关他们遣返的事项，以保证他们行使其被遣返权利。在九十天的解释之后，尚未行使其被遣返权利的战俘的处理问题，应交由在停战以后举行的政治会议在三十天之内讨论解决。在政治会议讨论之后尚未行使其被遣返权利而政治会议仍未替他们协议出处理办法的战俘，应由中立国遣返委员会把他们释放成为平民，其中凡申请去中立国者应由中立国遣返委员会在另外三十天内协助前往。
    朝中方面同意采取“职权范围”所规定的步骤，是为了使战俘问题得以早日解决，朝鲜的流血得以早日停止。因此在坚持原则的同时，朝中方面在解决战俘问题的方法、步骤、时间上作了让步。朝中方面坚决认为，所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘是不存在的。由于美方对战俘实行了三年多的恐怖统治，许多战俘受到美方的恐吓和压迫，心怀疑惧，不敢要求遣返。这些战俘，只要使他们从美方的控制下摆脱出来，经过朝中方面的解释，他们的疑惧心理就可以消失，他们的遣返问题就可以得到合理的解决。因此，解除美方对战俘的恐怖控制，并使战俘得有自由和充分的时间来听取解释，乃是保证战俘行使遣返权利的必要前提。朝中方面所以建议将战俘交给中立国遣返委员会，“职权范围”之所以签订，都是为了达到这个目的。
    美方同意“职权范围”却是出于被迫的。“职权范围”的彻底实施，就必然要使美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋完全破产。因此，在“职权范围”签订之前，美方就曾要求在停战生效时将所有朝鲜人民军被俘人员在南朝鲜就地“释放”。这个荒谬绝伦的要求遭到了世界舆论的一致谴责，使美方不得不把它收回。美方在舆论的压力之下被迫接受了“职权范围”之后，就竭力设法加以破坏。在协议签订以后十天，美方就背信弃义地纵容李承晚从战俘营里劫走了二万七千多名战俘，使朝鲜的流血战争又因此而延长了一个多月。接着美方就在其战俘营里加强特务恐怖组织，加紧以暴力控制战俘，并将这一整套特务组织原封不动地送进了东场里战俘营场。
    在将战俘交给中立国遣返委员会看管以后，美方初则对修建解释帐篷故意怠工，拖延朝中方面解释工作的开始；继又通过各种途径，以他们所提供的美军第六十四野战医院为中心，指挥特务破坏解释工作。这些特务不让战俘出来听取解释，以骇人听闻的恐怖手段阻止战俘遣返，甚至将要求遣返的战俘加以野蛮的杀害。中立国遣返委员会在其一九五三年十二月二十八日向双方提出的“临时报告”中，完全证实了美方的这一切罪行。由于美方的破坏，朝中方面的解释工作一共只进行了十天，百分之八十五以上的战俘未能听取解释。
      纵然如此，仍然有六百多名战俘摆脱特务的控制而要求遣返。他们在板门店所揭露的美方强迫扣留战俘的罪行，使美方说这些战俘“宁愿自杀也不愿回家”的谎言进一步地彻底破产了。老羞成怒的美国当局，更加加紧破坏解释工作，并片面宣布在去年十二月二十三日终止解释，要求中立国遣返委员会允许它在一月二十三日强迫扣留战俘，否则就要用武力将战俘劫走。
    美方为了避免在政治会议上讨论战俘问题，竭力拖延政治会议的召开，在一九五三年十二月十二日片面中断了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，以便于它强迫扣留战俘阴谋的实现。
    朝中方面和中立国遣返委员会都反对美方破坏“职权范围”实施的行为，主张按照“职权范围”的规定，继续进行解释，补足九十天的解释日期，并主张战俘问题应由政治会议讨论解决。但是中立国遣返委员会印度主席没有执行按照“职权范围”所赋予委员会的合法权力，反而片面作出违反“职权范围”的决定，将二万一千多名朝中战俘从一月二十日起交还给美方，这样就便利了美方强迫扣留战俘阴谋的实现。
    美国侵略者强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，使全世界更加看清楚了美帝国主义是最腐朽、最野蛮、最无信义的帝国主义。它为了“冷战”的利益，为了继续在朝鲜保持紧张局势，使朝鲜问题不能得到和平解决，公然撕毁一切国际公法和它所亲自签订的协议，采取为人道与正义所不容的手段，使成千成万战俘不能回到自己的家乡和祖国，强迫他们去充当李承晚和蒋介石匪帮的炮灰。美国侵略者将战俘从朝鲜非军事区运走，只能使它在政治上和道义上失败得更加彻底。
