The cultural center and station undertaking has greatly developed throughout the country in the past four years. They have conducted patriotic and internationalist education for the broad masses through various mass cultural activities, and have improved the masses’ political consciousness and labor enthusiasm, which is an achievement.

However, the development of cultural centers and stations across the country has been too much and too fast, and the quality of work is generally not high. Many cultural centers and stations have many serious shortcomings: First, the nature, principles, and tasks of cultural centers and stations are not clear enough. Cultural centers should be career institutions for carrying out mass cultural activities, but in practice, the activities of many cultural centers have exceeded their own business scope and inappropriately done some government cultural administration work. There is a lack of focus in work, and bureaucratism and commandism have even occurred in some places. In terms of service objects, they have failed to pay special attention to carrying out cultural work among the local workers and peasants. In terms of publicity content, they have not been closely integrated with the central tasks of various periods in the area, and have failed to guarantee a certain level of political quality. The publicity methods are also mostly not in line with the tastes of the masses, and some cultural centers have a tendency to be extravagant and wasteful in their work and pursue impractical forms. In terms of working methods, they are not good at relying on the masses and organizing and using social forces from all sides. The reasons for the above shortcomings are mainly the long-term lack of clear leadership from the cultural administrative departments for the work of cultural centers and stations. The cultural administrative departments in many places lack specific guidance, inspection and assistance for the cultural centers and stations, and even assign unqualified personnel to work in the cultural centers and stations, or often transfer cadres from the cultural centers and stations to do other work, thus making the undertaking of the cultural centers and stations fail to achieve the due effect, or even in a state of leaderless drift.

The above shortcomings have been gradually corrected in various places in recent years. In order to further overcome the shortcomings, consolidate the achievements, and improve and enhance the work of cultural centers and stations, the following instructions are hereby made:

I. Cultural centers and stations are career institutions established by the government to carry out mass cultural work and enliven mass cultural life. Their basic task is to meet the cultural needs of the local masses—especially workers and peasants—through various mass cultural activities, and to educate the masses with the spirit of patriotism and socialism, making them conscious and active defenders and builders of the motherland. The tasks of cultural centers and stations are as follows:

	1. Conduct publicity on current events and policies for the broad masses, and educate the masses to strive to realize the general line of the country;
	2. Organize and guide the masses in various cultural studies, and cooperate with the work of eliminating illiteracy;
	3. Organize and guide the masses' amateur artistic activities (including various cultural entertainment);
	4. Popularize scientific, technical and health knowledge related to the daily life and industrial and agricultural production of the masses.

II. In order to carry out the above tasks, cultural centers should carry out a series of specific tasks inside and outside the centers, such as: holding various regular or temporary lecture meetings and forums, holding various fixed or mobile exhibitions; organizing and holding slide and film screenings; organizing the masses to listen to radio programs; guiding amateur theater troupes and organizing their performances; holding various cultural and entertainment evenings; holding indoor and outdoor games; guiding the masses' blackboard newspapers; guiding the masses' various cultural and technical studies, such as carrying out the reading of popular books and periodicals, guiding the masses' reading groups, reading groups, production technology research groups, and assisting in the work of eliminating illiteracy and the masses' literacy learning, etc.

When holding and organizing the above-mentioned activities, cultural centers and stations in various places must proceed from the specific conditions of the area where they are located, base on the needs of the masses and their own conditions, and on the premise of giving full play to the role of existing manpower and equipment, adapt to local conditions, act according to their capabilities, and avoid mechanically copying regardless of the situation, being greedy for more and pursuing the large, and pursuing formalistic practices. The cultural centers in large cities should be different from those in medium and small cities in terms of activity methods. Generally, cultural centers in medium and small cities and suburbs of large cities should adopt simple and feasible small-scale activities.

III. In view of the lack of work experience and cadres of cultural stations, cultural stations will no longer be developed in various places for the time being, but efforts should be concentrated on earnestly rectifying and improving the existing cultural stations, and some purely formalistic cultural stations should be reduced or merged as appropriate. Cultural stations should first do a good job in the mass cultural work in their localities, such as circulating popular books and periodicals, organizing slide shows, holding photo exhibitions, and guiding blackboard newspapers, reading groups, and amateur theater troupes of the masses. In addition, cultural stations should provide the surrounding rural areas with their equipment and tools (such as books, slides, etc.) to carry out mass cultural activities, and provide guidance on working methods and techniques. Cultural stations are administratively led by the local people's government and professionally guided by the county (district) cultural center. Since there is only one full-time cadre in the cultural station, all its activities, including daily work, must pay attention to absorbing activists from the masses to assist in the work on a voluntary basis.

Rural clubs are amateur mass cultural organizations established by farmers on the principle of voluntariness. Guiding the work of rural clubs is one of the tasks of cultural centers and stations. Due to the limitations of various conditions in rural areas and the lack of guidance experience of cultural centers and stations, although many have been established in various places, there are not many that can be consolidated and have regular activities. Therefore, rural clubs should be piloted with emphasis to create experience, and should not be blindly developed in large quantities.

IV. In terms of working methods, cultural centers and stations in various places must be good at combining the central work tasks of the area to carry out their own business, and be good at planning their work based on the needs of the masses. Cultural stations must pay special attention to adapting to the seasonal characteristics of agricultural production. All activities of cultural centers and stations must be based on the needs and voluntary principles of the masses, respect local customs and ethnic and folk traditions, and adopt forms that the masses like to see and hear. Anything that the masses do not welcome or are not enthusiastic about should not be held. Cultural centers and stations must use various appropriate methods to extensively absorb and organize the forces of all parties in the area, such as trade unions, youth leagues, women's federations, and relevant agencies, groups, schools, etc., to carry out various activities (such as inviting the main responsible cadres or propagandists of local party and government organizations to report on current affairs and policy issues, organizing local literary and art groups or literary and art workers to guide the masses' amateur art activities, etc.), and in their work, they must pay practical attention to relying on the masses and cultivating activists, so as to establish the backbone and core forces in mass cultural activities. All cultural centers and stations should, according to the above principles, do a good job in several major tasks in a planned and focused manner, and strictly prevent and correct the bad tendencies of not looking at the target, disregarding conditions, aiming high and being unrealistic, pursuing formalism, and engaging in paternalism, coercion and commandism.

V. Strengthening and improving the leadership of people's governments at all levels over cultural centers and stations is an important key to improving the work of cultural centers and stations. From now on, people's governments at all levels above the county level must earnestly strengthen the leadership and management of cultural centers and stations. To this end, (1) the people's governments of counties and cities, in addition to assigning special personnel to manage cultural work within the Bureau of Culture and Education, should also designate the head or deputy head of the Bureau of Culture and Education to be responsible for leading the work of cultural centers and stations; in large and medium-sized cities where cultural centers have been established with districts as units, the cultural centers should generally be led by the people's government of the district where they are located. Medium and small cities that do not establish centers by district should be directly led by the city or county people's government, but attention must be paid to prevent the work of the cultural centers from being out of touch with the central work of the district where they are located.

  (2) The cultural departments of the people's governments of each province (city) should conduct a practical rectification of the organization of cultural centers and stations in accordance with the principles of streamlining and the actual needs of the area, make appropriate adjustments to the original personnel, and those who are truly unqualified should be assisted in changing careers. (3) The cultural departments of the people's governments of provinces and cities should plan to cultivate and improve the cadres of cultural centers and stations through short-term training courses and meetings. In 1954, the cultural departments of each province and city should universally train all heads of cultural centers once. The general cadres of cultural centers and stations should be trained in batches and on a rotating basis. In addition to the cultural and educational policies, the principles and tasks of cultural centers and stations, and relevant professional knowledge, the training content should also give appropriate weight to the study of the current general line of national construction and various specific policies. In terms of methods, it should be combined with inspection work, summarize experience, focus on reporting and discussion, and supplemented with the necessary teaching of specialized professional knowledge. In addition, the Bureaus of Culture and Education of the people's governments of counties and districts must strengthen the regular leadership of the policy and business learning of the cadres of cultural centers and stations, and constantly improve their political and ideological and professional level. (4) The cultural administrative departments of the people's governments at all levels above the county level should establish a system to regularly review the work plans of cultural centers and inspect and summarize their work. And pay special attention to supervising and inspecting the political and ideological content of various propaganda works carried out by cultural centers and stations. The people's governments where cultural centers and stations are located should absorb responsible cadres of cultural centers and stations to participate in their relevant meetings, regularly listen to the work reports of cultural centers and stations, study and help them solve the problems and difficulties existing in their work in a timely manner. For the cadres of cultural centers and stations, on the one hand, their specialization should be guaranteed in the future, and they should not be given too many temporary tasks; at the same time, they should be guided from the positive side to actively cooperate with the central tasks of various periods through their own business.

VI. After receiving this instruction, the cultural departments of the people's governments of each province and city should immediately conduct a universal inspection of the work of cultural centers and stations in accordance with the spirit of this instruction, conduct a comprehensive study of relevant issues, and then formulate specific plans and implementation plans for rectifying and improving the work of cultural centers and stations based on the specific conditions of the area, and submit them to the cultural departments of the major administrative committees for approval, and the cultural departments of the major regions should comprehensively formulate the implementation plans for the major regions, and implement them starting from the 1954 fiscal year.

    中央人民政府文化部
    关于整顿和加强文化馆、站工作的指示
    四年来，全国文化馆、站事业有很大发展。它们通过各种群众性的文化活动，对广大人民进行了爱国主义和国际主义的教育，提高了群众的政治觉悟和劳动热情，是有成绩的。
    但是全国文化馆、站的发展太多太快，工作质量一般不高，不少文化馆、站存在着不少严重的缺点：首先是文化馆、站的性质和方针、任务不够明确；文化馆本来应该是开展群众文化活动的事业机构，但实际上不少文化馆的活动却超出了本身的业务范围，不适当地做了一些政府文化行政管理工作。工作缺乏重心，有些地方甚至发生官僚主义、命令主义现象；在服务对象方面未能特别注意开展当地工、农劳动群众中的文化工作，在宣传内容上，结合当地各个时期的中心任务不够密切，未能保证一定的政治质量；在宣传方式上也多不合群众的口味，有的文化馆在工作中发生铺张浪费，追求形式等不切合实际的倾向。在工作方法上，不善于依靠群众及组织和运用各方面的社会力量。产生上述缺点的原因，主要是文化行政主管部门对文化馆、站工作长期缺乏明确领导。不少地方的文化行政主管部门对文化馆、站缺乏具体指导、检查和帮助，甚至分派一些不称职的人员担任文化馆、站的工作，或常常调文化馆、站干部去做其他工作，因而使文化馆、站的事业得不到应有的成效，甚至处于一种无领导的自流状态。
    上述缺点，年来各地已逐渐有所改正。为了进一步克服缺点巩固成绩，以改进和提高文化馆、站工作，特作如下指示：
    一、文化馆、站是政府为开展群众文化工作、活跃群众文化生活而设立的事业机构，其基本任务是：通过各种群众性的文化活动，满足当地群众——特别是工、农群众的文化需要，并以爱国主义和社会主义的精神教育群众，使其成为祖国的自觉的积极的保卫者与建设者。文化馆、站的工作任务为下列各项：
    1、向广大人民进行时事政策的宣传，教育群众为实现国家的总路线而奋斗；
    2、组织和辅导群众的各种文化学习，并配合扫除文盲工作；
    3、组织和辅导群众业余艺术活动（包括各种文化娱乐）；
    4、普及与群众日常生活和工、农业生产有关的科学、技术知识和卫生知识。
    二、为了执行以上任务，文化馆应在馆内外开展一系列的具体工作，如：举办各种定期的或临时的演讲会和座谈会，举办各种固定的或流动的展览；组织、举办幻灯、电影的放映；组织群众收听广播节目；辅导业余剧团并组织其演出；举办各种文化娱乐性质的晚会；举办室内外游戏；辅导群众的黑板报；辅导群众的各种文化技术学习，如开展通俗书刊的阅览，辅导群众的读书组、读报组、生产技术研究组及协助扫除文盲工作与群众的识字学习等。
    各地文化馆、站在举办和组织上述各种活动时，必须从所在地区的具体情况出发，根据群众需要和本身条件，在充分发挥已有人力设备作用的前提下，因地制宜，量力而行，切忌不问情况机械抄袭，贪多求大，追求形式的作法。在活动方式上，大城市的文化馆和中、小城市的文化馆应有所区别。一般中、小城市和大城市郊区的文化馆应多采取简易可行的小型活动。
    三、鉴于文化站的工作经验不多，干部缺乏，因之，目前各地一律不再发展文化站，而应集中力量对已有的文化站进行认真的整顿和改进，对某些徒具形式的文化站，并应酌予裁并。文化站应首先将所在地的群众文化工作做好，如举办通俗书刊的流通，组织放映幻灯，举办图片展览，辅导黑板报、读报组和群众业余剧团等。此外，文化站应以其设备、工具（如图书、幻灯等）供给周围农村开展群众文化活动，并在工作方法与技术上予以辅导。文化站在行政上受当地区人民政府领导，在业务上受县（区）文化馆指导。由于文化站的专职干部只有一人，因此，它的一切活动，包括日常工作在内，均须注意在自愿条件下吸收群众中的积极分子协助进行。
    农村俱乐部是农民依据自愿原则建立的业余性的群众文化组织，辅导农村俱乐部工作是文化馆、站的任务之一，由于目前农村各方面条件的限制和文化馆、站辅导经验的不足，各地虽已建立不少，但能巩固下来经常有活动的却不多。因之，农村俱乐部应重点试办，以创造经验，不应盲目地大量发展。
    四、各地文化馆、站在工作方法上必须善于结合当地的中心工作任务，来开展本身业务，善于从群众的需要出发，来规划自己的工作。文化站更必须特别注意适应农业生产季节性的特点进行工作。文化馆、站的一切活动均必须根据群众的需要和自愿的原则，尊重当地的风俗习惯和民族的、民间的固有传统，采取群众喜闻乐见的形式。凡群众不欢迎，不热心的事均不应举办。文化馆、站必须运用各种适当的方式，广泛地吸收和组织当地各方面的力量，如工会、青年团、妇联，以及各有关机关、团体、学校等来进行各种活动（如邀请当地党、政组织的主要负责干部或宣传员报告时事政策问题，组织所在地文艺团体或文艺工作者辅导群众业余的艺术活动等），并在工作中切实注意依靠群众和培养积极分子，以树立群众文化活动中的骨干和核心力量。所有文化馆、站都应根据上述原则，有计划、有重点地做好几项主要工作，严格防止和纠正不看对象，不顾条件，好高骛远，追求形式以及包办代替，强迫命令的不良倾向。
    五、加强并改善各级人民政府对文化馆、站的领导，是改进文化馆、站工作的重要关键。今后，县以上各级人民政府均须切实加强对文化馆、站的领导与管理。为此，（一）县及市区人民政府除应于文教科内确定专人管理文化工作外，并应指定文教科长或副科长一人负责领导文化馆、站的工作；大、中城市已以区为单位分设文化馆者，该文化馆一般应由所在区的区人民政府领导，中、小城市不是按区设馆，应由市或县人民政府直接领导，但须注意防止文化馆工作与其所在区的中心工作脱节。
  （二）各省（市）人民政府文化主管部门对文化馆、站的组织，应根据精简原则及当地实际需要，加以切实的整顿，在原有人员中加以适当调整，其中确有不称职者，应帮助其转业。（三）省、市人民政府文化主管部门，应有计划地通过举办短期训练班和召开会议的方式培养、提高文化馆、站的干部，一九五四年内各省市文化主管部门应将全部文化馆长普遍训练一次。文化馆、站的一般干部应有计划地分批轮训。训练内容除文教政策、文化馆、站的方针、任务与有关的业务知识外，对当前国家建设的总路线及各项具体政策的学习也应占适当的比重。在方法上，应结合检查工作，总结经验，以报告讨论为主，辅以必要的专门业务知识的讲授。此外，县、区人民政府文教科必须加强对文化馆、站干部的政策、业务学习的经常领导，不断提高其政治思想与业务水平。（四）县以上各级人民政府文化行政部门应订立制度，定期审查文化馆工作计划和检查、总结其工作。并特别注意监督和检查文化馆、站所进行的各项宣传工作的政治思想内容。文化馆、站所在地的人民政府应当吸收文化馆、站负责干部参加其召开的有关会议，定期听取文化馆、站的工作报告，研究并及时帮助他们解决在工作中存在的问题与困难。对于文化馆、站干部今后一方面要保证其专业化，不应交予过多的临时任务；同时应从积极方面指导他们通过本身的业务，主动地配合各个时期的中心任务。
    六、各省、市人民政府文化主管部门于接到本指示后，应即根据本指示的精神，对文化馆、站的工作普遍进行一次检查，并对有关问题作一次通盘的研究，然后根据当地具体情况定出整顿和改进文化馆、站工作的具体计划与实施方案，报经大区行政委员会文化主管部门批准，并由各大区文化主管部门综合制订各大区的实施方案，自一九五四年度起予以执行。
