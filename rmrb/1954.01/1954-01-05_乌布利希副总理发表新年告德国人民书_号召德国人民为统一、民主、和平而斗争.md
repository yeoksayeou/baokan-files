    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 2nd (TASS): The German News Agency reported that Walter Ulbricht, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, issued a New Year's address to the German people, wishing all peace-loving Germans victory in 1954 in their struggle to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

    Walter Ulbricht emphasized that all peace-loving Germans, regardless of their worldview, demand the maintenance of peace, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the reunification of Germany into a peace-loving, democratic state. Walter Ulbricht called on the German people to intensify their struggle in 1954 against the resurgence of German militarism and against the "European Defense Community" war treaty, which will plunge Germany into disaster.

    In referring to the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference, Walter Ulbricht said: All peace-loving Germans welcome the Soviet proposal to convene a Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The majority of the German people support the proposal of the government of the German Democratic Republic: the Berlin Conference should discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty and the restoration of the unity of a peace-loving, democratic Germany. The majority of the German people demand the reunification of Germany in freedom, that is, by ensuring Germany's national independence and the withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany through the conclusion of a peace treaty. Only by resolutely rejecting the so-called "European Defense Community" agreement and other war treaties signed by the Bonn government is it possible to reunify Germany in freedom. The German people are unwilling to be enslaved until 2003, as stipulated by the Bonn and Paris treaties and the so-called "European Defense Community."

    Walter Ulbricht mentioned the proposals repeatedly put forward by the German Democratic Republic to reach an all-German agreement to strengthen peace and restore German unity, improve the living standards of the German people, and expressed the hope that these proposals could be realized in 1954.

    Walter Ulbricht appealed to the German people: We must jointly make every effort to ensure that a round table conference between Germans can be held.

    乌布利希副总理发表新年告德国人民书
    号召德国人民为统一、民主、和平而斗争
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社柏林二日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德意志民主共和国副总理瓦尔特·乌布利希发表新年告德国人民书，预祝爱好和平的德国人一九五四年在为建立一个统一的、民主的与爱好和平的德国而进行的斗争中获得胜利。
    瓦尔特·乌布利希强调，所有爱好和平的德国人，不管他们的世界观如何，都要求保持和平，缔结对德和约与使德国重新统一成为一个爱好和平的、民主的国家。瓦尔特·乌布利希号召德国人民在一九五四年加紧斗争，反对德国军国主义再起，反对“欧洲防务集团”战争条约——这个条约将把德国投入灾难。
    在谈到将要举行的四国外长会议时，瓦尔特·乌布利希说：所有爱好和平的德国人都欢迎苏联关于召开四国外长会议的建议。大多数的德国人民都赞成德意志民主共和国政府的建议：柏林会议应该讨论缔结和约和恢复一个爱好和平的、民主的德国的统一。大多数德国人民要求，在自由的情况下重新统一德国，就是说，通过缔结和约保证德国的民族独立和从德国撤退占领军。只有坚决地拒绝波恩政府所签订的所谓“欧洲防务集团”协定和其他战争条约，才有可能在自由的情况下重新统一德国。德国人民不愿像波恩和巴黎条约以及所谓“欧洲防务集团”所规定的那样，一直被奴役到二○○三年。
    瓦尔特·乌布利希提到德意志民主共和国曾一再提出的达成全德协议，以加强和平和恢复德国的统一、提高德国人民的生活水平的建议，并表示希望这些建议在一九五四年内能够实现。
    瓦尔特·乌布利希向德国人民号召说：我们必须共同地尽一切努力使德国人之间的圆桌会议得以举行。
