Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd—The leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) joyfully celebrated the first victorious New Year after the Korean armistice. In the garrisons of the organs and troops, on the snow-covered land, soldiers erected many pine gates, with red New Year couplets pasted on both sides. Two couplets were particularly eye-catching: "Celebrate the New Year, sing the praises of the motherland's peace and happiness; Raise your glasses to wish Chairman Mao a long life" and "Defend the motherland's large-scale economic construction; Help Korea heal the wounds of war." Many units' wall newspapers also published special celebration supplements on New Year's Day.

At 12:30 noon on New Year's Day, the CPV leadership held a grand New Year group greeting ceremony. More than 600 cadres present warmly extended New Year greetings to the leaders of the CPV.

At the New Year group greeting ceremony, General Yang Dezhi, Deputy Commander of the CPV, delivered a speech. He first extended New Year greetings to all commanders and fighters on behalf of the CPV leaders and wished everyone good health. Then, General Yang Dezhi described the great achievements of 1953, analyzed the current situation, and called on all commanders and fighters to heighten their vigilance, stand firm in their positions, and fight to the end for the full realization of the armistice agreement and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. General Yang Dezhi called on all cadres in 1954 to conscientiously summarize various experiences, continue to improve their leadership style, conscientiously study the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, and continue to enhance the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. General Yang Dezhi called on all cadres to actively subscribe to the 1954 national economic construction bonds. He said: Our purchase of bonds is for the socialist industrialization of the motherland, which is a concrete action for us to support the general line of the state during the transition period. We must over fulfill this glorious task.

After the meeting, the CPV's performance team put on a wonderful show.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Commanders and fighters of the CPV units spent the first New Year after the Korean armistice happily with a sense of victory.

On New Year's Day, the CPV positions were filled with festive joy. CPV soldiers on the "Dingzishan" position planted the motherland's five-star red flag on the high point of the position. Many organs continuously broadcast songs of the motherland on the radio. Commanders and fighters of various units held group greetings and remotely wished Chairman Mao and Marshal Kim Il-sung a happy New Year. Soldiers held talks on the positions, recalling the great victory of 1953, summarizing their contributions in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and formulating work plans for the new year. Many units' cadres and soldiers wrote letters to Chairman Mao and the CPV leaders to congratulate them on the New Year. Hou Yongxin, deputy squad leader of a certain unit's Second-Class Hero squad and First-Class Merit Citation recipient in the Battle of Shangganling, and Kuang Housheng, squad leader of a First-Class Merit Citation squad, wrote letters to Chairman Mao to report on their progress in the past year and expressed their determination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to the end. Ma Youcai, a First-Class Merit Citation recipient of a certain unit, also wrote a letter to the model workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company to congratulate them on the New Year. Many companies published New Year's wall newspapers, recording the achievements of the past year and future plans for meritorious service. Many units held get-togethers, and soldiers sang heartily about the great victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the great achievements of the motherland's construction. Some units' soldiers also held sports meets on the positions. On New Year's Day, the CPV units extended cordial greetings to the Korean people near their garrisons.

Many commanders and fighters wrote letters home on New Year's Day, using concrete examples to promote the state's general line during the transition period and mobilizing their families to sell surplus grain to the state. Lin Huayang, a First-Class Merit Citation recipient of a certain unit, wrote a letter to mobilize his mother to sell all of the more than 1,800 jin of grain she had saved over the years to the state. Wu Shanri, a soldier of a certain company, wrote a letter to encourage his father to work hard in production at home and to play a exemplary role in selling surplus grain to the state and subscribing to bonds.

While joyfully celebrating the New Year, CPV commanders and fighters expressed their determination to heighten their vigilance, strictly guard their positions, defend the construction of the motherland, strive for the full realization of the Korean armistice agreement, and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and welcome the new year of 1954.
