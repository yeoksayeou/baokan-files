Implementing a "Flow-Line Operation" Method of Layer-by-Layer Mobilization and Gradual Deepening
Licheng County, Shandong Province, Creates Good Experience in Grain Procurement Work

[This newspaper reports] The Licheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, taking the in-depth promotion of the General Line as a driving force, carried out winter production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and used the "flow-line operation" method to carry out grain procurement work. This method of "layer-by-layer mobilization, gradual deepening, constant education, and constant action" has achieved good results. As of now, the county is nearing completion of the procurement plan, and three districts have overfulfilled the procurement plan.

The "flow-line operation" grain procurement method first fully leverages the driving force of the General Line on the basis of deeply promoting the General Line. Starting from summarizing and evaluating production mutual aid, it enables the masses to recognize the close relationship between production, mutual aid and cooperation, grain procurement, and other tasks, thereby actively engaging in production activities, organizing and developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and selling surplus grain to the state. For example, the Zhan Zhaowen mutual aid team in Zhan Village Township, District Ten, inspired by the General Line education, analyzed the reasons for increased production, identified the key to increased production, and improved the team members' determination to take the socialist road of collectivization, actively requesting to establish an agricultural production cooperative. Through creating a production plan and studying ways to expand production investment, the team members consciously sold 5,200 jin of surplus grain to the state and immediately used the money from the grain sale to buy cattle, pigs, and farm tools, and also deposited the remaining funds in the bank for future fertilizer purchases. After selling the grain, the team members' enthusiasm was even higher, and they mobilized two smaller mutual aid teams to sell grain as well. The three teams immediately negotiated and established an agricultural production cooperative.

The "flow-line operation" grain procurement method is suitable for the grain selling habits and psychology of the broad masses of peasants. It facilitates waiting for the masses to awaken and is easily accepted by the masses. During grain procurement, many people have a wait-and-see attitude, watching the cadres, watching the Party members, and watching others. With the gradual deepening of the General Line education, coupled with the influence of advanced mutual aid teams and active elements selling grain, the wait-and-see attitude of the masses is easily changed, and the consciousness of the backward masses will gradually increase, which effectively prevents the deviation of coercion and commandism. In this grain procurement process in Licheng County, the selling pattern of many farmers was from selling less to selling more, selling some and then seeing before selling more, and many farmers sold two or three times before selling all their surplus grain.

The "flow-line operation" grain procurement method can adapt to the unevenness in grain procurement work. It is based on mutual aid teams, absorbs individual farmers, moves from point to area, from easy to difficult, and is driven by the advanced to lead the backward. Therefore, it can fully leverage the backbone and leading role of cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and active elements. For example, when grain procurement began in Tantou Township, District One, the masses generally had a wait-and-see attitude; when Guo Yuancai's team reported selling surplus grain, some people thought it was just "empty talk." Only after the team delivered the grain to the warehouse did they change their understanding, acknowledging that the team was a "flagpole team" and believing that "there is no loss in learning from him," and they sold surplus grain one after another. Because this method involves educating while acting, acting on one group after it matures, it is possible to move from the advanced to the backward, from the few to the many, breaking through layer by layer, driving layer by layer, using action to promote the progress of the movement, and deepening the entire movement step by step in continuous action. This effectively prevents the shortcomings of subjectivism, demanding uniformity, and the potential problems of a single action.

The "flow-line operation" grain procurement method relies on educational maturity and is a practice of letting things ripen naturally. Whoever understands first sells first, whoever does not understand will be educated again, and whenever they understand they will sell, and if they do not sell all at once, they will be mobilized to sell again. This ensures the correct implementation of the principle of conscious voluntarism and prevents the impatience and commandism that are inevitably associated with mechanically dividing education and action stages and adopting shock tactics.

In addition, the "flow-line operation" grain procurement method is a method of reporting, selling, and delivering grain at any time. The grain receiving station can receive grain upon arrival, preventing congestion and accidents involving people and animals, and without wasting the time of the masses; this method is also beneficial to currency withdrawal and material supply work and can better combine business work and political work.

     实行层层发动逐步深入的“流水作业”法
     山东历城县创造购粮工作好经验
     【本报讯】中共历城县委会以深入宣传总路线为动力，开展冬季生产和互助合作运动，并以“流水作业”的方法，进行粮食收购工作。这种“层层发动，逐步深入，随时教育，随时行动”的方法，已收到很好的效果，至目前为止，全县已接近完成收购计划，三个区已超额完成了收购计划。
   “流水作业”的购粮方法，首先是在深入宣传总路线的基础上，充分发挥总路线的动力作用，从总结评比生产互助入手，使群众认识了生产、互助合作、收购粮食等项工作的密切关系，从而积极进行生产活动，整理和发展互助合作组织，并把余粮卖给国家。如十区展村乡展兆文互助组，在总路线教育的鼓舞下，通过分析增产原因，找出增产关键，提高了组员组织起来走社会主义道路的决心，积极要求办农业生产合作社。通过打生产谱，研究扩大生产投资的办法，组员们便自觉地把余粮五千二百斤卖给国家，并立即用卖粮的钱买牛、猪和农具，还把余款存入银行留待购买肥料。卖粮后，组员情绪更加高涨，分头动员了二个较小的互助组也卖了粮。三个组并立即协商建成了一处农业生产合作社。
    “流水作业”的购粮方法，适合广大农民卖粮的习惯和心理，便于等待群众的觉悟，容易为群众所接受。在收购粮食中，有不少群众抱着观望等待的心理，看干部、看党员、看别人。随着总路线教育的逐步深入，加上先进互助组和积极分子售粮的影响，群众的观望等待心理就易于改变，落后群众的觉悟也会逐步提高，这就有效地防止了强迫命令的偏差。这次历城县的购粮过程中，不少农民的卖粮规律是从少卖到多卖，卖了一些后看看再卖，很多农民卖到两三次才把余粮卖完。
    “流水作业”购粮方法能够适应购粮工作中的不平衡性，它以互助组为基础，吸收单干农民参加，由点到面，从易到难，由先进带动落后，因而就能够充分地发挥合作社互助组和积极分子的骨干带头作用。如一区滩头乡开始收购粮食时，群众普遍观望等待；郭元才组报卖余粮时，有些人认为不过是“空口说白话”，及至该组送粮入仓后，才改变了认识，承认该组是“旗杆组”，认为“跟着他学没亏吃”，纷纷出售余粮了。由于这种方法是边教育边行动，成熟一组行动一组，因而就可以从先进到落后，从少数到多数，层层打通，层层带动，用行动推动运动前进，在不断的行动中，使整个运动步步深入，到最后全面发动起来。这样就有效地防止了那种主观主义、强求一致、一次行动所可能发生的毛病。
    “流水作业”购粮的方法依靠教育成熟，是一种瓜熟蒂落的做法。谁先通谁先卖，谁不通再教育，什么时候通了什么时候卖，一次没卖完动员再卖。这样就能正确地贯彻自觉自愿的原则，防止了机械划分教育和行动阶段、采用突击方式所不可避免的那种急躁情绪和强迫命令的现象发生。
    此外，“流水作业”购粮的方法是一种随报、随卖、随送的方法，收粮站可以随到随收，不致发生拥挤和人畜伤亡事故，又不浪费群众的时间；这种方法对货币回笼和物资供应工作也有好处，可以把业务工作和政治工作更好地结合起来。
