Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 29th: This reporter reports that the US side, using military threats and collusion between special agents, forcibly removed more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war from Tongjang-ri. This is merely the final step in the US side's entire plan, prepared long in advance, to completely tear up the "Terms of Reference."

This destructive plan was drafted even before the Korean armistice was realized. On September 27th of last year, before the explanatory work had even begun, sixty-five Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who collectively rushed out of the camp to demand repatriation presented a leaflet issued to the prisoners of war by the US side and showed this leaflet to neutral nation personnel and journalists from various countries at Panmunjom. This printed leaflet told the prisoners of war that within sixty days after the armistice was signed, "you may be moved to another place, but your camp commanders, American guards, and members of the Public Information and Education Group (reporter's note: i.e., the US special intelligence agency CIE) will definitely move with you." The US side threatened the prisoners of war in this leaflet that if they demanded repatriation and returned to their homeland, "it could mean death." In the lower left corner of the leaflet was also printed a picture of a ship sailing at sea. The content of this leaflet clearly shows that the US side's purpose in handing over the prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was not to give the prisoners of war the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation, but to obstruct and disrupt the explanatory work, in order to carry out shameful "cold war" propaganda.

This leaflet also illustrates that the US side's implementation of destroying the "Terms of Reference" was arranged long in advance. It admits that the US side preserved the special agent organizations in the prisoner of war camps and sent them together into the Tongjang-ri prisoner of war camps in order to continue to maintain control over the prisoners of war, so that the premise for the implementation of the "Terms of Reference" was first destroyed. Prisoners of war who escaped from Tongjang-ri said that after the "Terms of Reference" agreement was reached, Taiwan Kuomintang special agent chiefs Fang Zhi and Ni Wenya, Rhee Syngman's military police commander Guan Yuanrongde, and U.S. Far East Command Psychological Warfare Office director Colonel Hanson and CIE director Colonel Osman all went to various prisoner of war camps to arrange for the strengthening of the special agent organizations. These organizations were then brought intact into the Tongjang-ri camps, and further strengthened. To facilitate the mixing of special agents into the camps, the US side forced most prisoners of war to tear up their prisoner of war cards when they were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Many special agents, wearing dark glasses, wearing expensive clothes, and leading wolfhounds, swaggered in leading the prisoners of war into Tongjang-ri. As soon as they arrived there, they immediately reorganized and strengthened the original control system, expanded the "security forces," established torture chambers, and dug burial pits. Flagpoles and sports equipment prepared in advance by the US side became tools for the special agents to torture and persecute prisoners of war as soon as they entered Tongjang-ri. Tongjang-ri was still a living hell where Li and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents ran rampant, and the prisoners of war were still suffering in this living hell, without any will or freedom to express their wishes.

In order to facilitate the command of special agents to disrupt the explanatory work, the US side prepared a complete communication and liaison system. In addition to various signals and liaison methods pre-arranged with special agents, the US side also equipped the special agents with many radio receivers to bring into the camps, so that they could listen to US instructions at any time. The Tongjang-ri prisoner of war camps built by the US side were also designed to facilitate communication between special agents and between special agents and the US side. As the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission pointed out in its "Interim Report": "The prisoners of war are concentrated in large numbers in various camps. The camps are so close to each other, and the enclosures are so close to each other, that they can see and hear each other. Under these circumstances, even a simple action in one camp can cause disturbances in other camps. In the event of large-scale disturbances, the distribution of camps will be a serious obstacle to the work of the Indian Custodial Force." In this way, the camps built by the US side were extremely convenient for special agents to communicate with each other by using semaphore flags, throwing stones tied with letters, and other methods. The center of this communication system was the US Army's 64th Field Hospital provided by the US side. This hospital was very close to the southern edge of the Demilitarized Zone, and the kitchen in the hospital, which was closest to the southern edge of the Demilitarized Zone, became the center of special agent communication.

As for the explanatory facilities originally built by the US side, they were designed entirely to facilitate the disruption of explanatory work. These facilities were very close to the prisoner of war camps, and during the explanatory work, special agents could use loud noises to intimidate the prisoners of war and prevent the explanation from proceeding. They could even rush out of the barbed wire to kill the Korean and Chinese explanatory representatives. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also pointed out in its "Interim Report" that "the explanatory facilities originally built by the United Nations Command were completely unsuitable, and these facilities were too crowded in space, and it was impossible to conduct explanations in these facilities without being severely disturbed by the prisoners of war's noise and violence."

The construction of this explanatory facility by the US side was fully adapted to a complete set of methods they had prepared in advance to disrupt the explanation. This set of methods had been practiced many times in the US prisoner of war camps. The main thing was to not allow prisoners of war to listen to the explanation individually, to require collective listening to the explanation, and then to deliberately make trouble during the explanation process, attack and kill the explanatory representatives, and even drag the explanatory representatives into the prisoner of war camps for detention. Hamblen, the head of the repatriation group, later proposed a request against individual explanations based on this plan. However, the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" passed by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission disrupted the US plan. In order to re-arrange, the US side, regardless of the condemnation of world public opinion, delayed the start of the explanatory work by twenty days by delaying the reconstruction of the explanatory facilities. According to returned Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, during this period, the US side ordered its special agents stationed in the camps to frantically carry out various new arrangements to disrupt the explanatory work. CIE "instructors" read a large number of threatening lies to the prisoners of war every day, saying that if prisoners of war applied for repatriation in the explanation tent, they would still be sent back to the original camp, so they would inevitably be beaten to death. They also said that if prisoners of war applied for repatriation, it would not take effect unless the Swiss and Swedish commissioners raised their hands...and so on. This was obviously a new tactic formulated by American "psychological warfare" experts in response to the newly passed "Working Rules." This tactic also included the brutal killing of prisoners of war who demanded repatriation, creating a atmosphere of terror in the prisoner of war camps and explanatory sites, and using Li and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang special agents who had persecuted prisoners of war as US "representatives" and "translators" in order to threaten prisoners of war in the explanation tents.

But the US side knew from their experience on Koje Island that no amount of terror and intimidation could completely suppress the prisoners of war's desire to demand repatriation. As long as one prisoner of war demanded repatriation, the US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war would be completely bankrupt. Therefore, they had long prepared a plan to forcibly seize prisoners of war by force in the event that a large number of prisoners of war demanded repatriation. Returned prisoners of war from Tongjang-ri revealed that in the US prisoner of war camps in Nonsan and other places, US brigadier generals and major generals who claimed to be "responsible for the Allied Forces' repatriation of prisoners" and "responsible for transportation affairs" threatened the prisoners of war, saying: "We have deployed a strong position behind the neutral nation custodial camp. You can rush out at any time, and we will meet you with airplanes, cannons, and tanks!" American officers also gave the maps of their military deployment to Li and Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the prisoner of war camps. From the time the prisoners of war were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the US side constantly subjected the prisoners of war to military threats. During the day, the US military positions often made rumbling cannon sounds, and US military aircraft frequently circled over Tongjang-ri; at night, searchlights, flares, and tank lights constantly appeared over and around the Tongjang-ri prisoner of war camp. According to statistics from our civilian police, US military aircraft (including jet fighters) appeared in the Tongjang-ri area about 200 times, and several times directly circled over the camps, and searchlights and tank lights illuminated the camps more than 40 times. Returned personnel said that the special agents used these phenomena to intimidate the prisoners of war, saying that they and the Indian custodial forces were under the armed encirclement of the US military.

The thing the US side feared the most finally happened. More than 500 prisoners of war broke through the strict control of the special agents and demanded repatriation, causing the US side's "psychological warfare" to suffer a shameful failure. In order to save face, the US side implemented the final step in its entire plan to disrupt the implementation of the "Terms of Reference," forcibly seizing the prisoners of war by force and threats of force, and immediately handing them over to Li and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder. But even during the process of the prisoners of war being forcibly removed, nearly 100 prisoners of war rushed out to demand repatriation. This made the so-called "individual will" and "individual freedom" of the prisoners of war, which the US side used for propaganda afterwards, even more foul-smelling.

### 劫走战俘—美方彻底撕毁“职权范围”的最后一步

　　劫走战俘—美方彻底撕毁“职权范围”的最后一步
    【新华社开城二十九日电】本社特派记者报道：美方以军事威胁和特务胁迫里应外合地将二万多名朝中被俘人员从东场里劫走，这只是美方早已准备好了的彻底撕毁“职权范围”的整个计划中的最后一步。
    这个破坏计划是在朝鲜停战实现以前就开始拟订了的。在去年九月二十七日解释工作尚未开始的时候，六十五名集体冲出营场要求遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，曾经举出来一张美方发给战俘的传单，并在板门店把这张传单给中立国人员和各国记者看。这张铅印的传单告诉战俘说，在停战签字后六十天内，“你们可能搬到另一个地方去，但你们的营内长官、美国的警卫士兵和民众新闻教育组的人员（记者按：即美国特务机关CIE），一定和你们一同搬去。”美方在这张传单上恐吓战俘们说，如果他们要求遣返而回到他们的祖国去，“可能是送死”。在传单的左下角还印着轮船在海上行驶的图画。这张传单的内容清楚地表明，美方把战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会，目的并不是让战俘有行使遣返权利的机会，而是要阻挠和破坏解释工作，借以进行可耻的“冷战”宣传。
    这份传单也说明了美方破坏“职权范围”的实施是早有布置的。它供认美方保存战俘营中的特务组织，并把它们一起送进东场里战俘营，以便继续保持对战俘的控制，使“职权范围”实施的前提首先就遭到破坏。从东场里逃出的战俘们说，在“职权范围”达成协议以后，台湾国民党特务头子方治、倪文亚，李承晚宪兵总司令官元容德，以及远东美军总部心理作战处负责人汉生上校和CIE负责人奥斯门上校，都曾到各战俘营布置加强特务组织。这些组织以后便原封不动地带进了东场里营场，而且进一步加强了。为了便于特务分子混入营场，美方迫令大多数战俘在被移交给中立国遣返委员会时撕毁了战俘卡片。许多特务分子戴着黑眼镜、穿着阔绰的衣服、带着狼狗大摇大摆地押着战俘进入了东场里。他们一到那里就立即整顿并且加强了原来的控制系统，扩充了“警备队”，设立了苦刑室，挖了埋人坑。美方事先准备好的旗杆、体育用具，一进了东场里就成了特务们拷打、迫害战俘的工具。东场里依然是李、蒋特务横行不法的活地狱，战俘依然在这座活地狱中受煎熬，丝毫没有表达自己愿望的意志和自由。
    为了便于指挥特务破坏解释工作，美方准备好了一整套通讯联络的系统。除了和特务分子预先约好的各种信号和联络办法以外，美方还给特务分子配备了许多无线电收音机带进营场，以便他们随时收听美方的指示。美方所修建的东场里战俘营场，也是为了便于特务与特务之间以及特务与美方之间进行联络而设计的。正如中立国遣返委员会在其“临时报告”中所指出的：“战俘大批集中在各个营场中。营场与营场之间，围场与围场之间近得可以互相看见，互相听见。在这种情况下，甚至在一个营场里的简单行动都会引起其他营场的骚动。在大规模骚动的情况下，营场的分布情况，对印度看管部队进行工作会是一个很严重的障碍。”这样，美方所修建的营场就极便于特务们用打旗语、投掷绑着信件的石块等方法互相联络。这个联络系统的中心就是美方提供的美军第六十四野战医院。这个医院非常靠近非军事区南缘，而医院中最靠近非军事区南缘的伙房则成为特务联络的中心。
    至于美方最初所修建的解释设备，更是设计得完全是为了便于破坏解释工作。这些设备非常靠近战俘营场，在解释工作进行时，特务分子可以用喧闹声音来恫吓战俘并使解释不能进行。他们甚至可以冲出铁丝网来杀害朝中方面的解释代表。中立国遣返委员会在其“临时报告”中也指出，“联合国军原来修建的解释设备曾是完全不适合的，这些设备在空间上太挤，在这些设备里进行解释想不受战俘喧嚣与暴力行为的最严重的扰乱是不可能的。”
    美方这种解释设备的修建，是完全适应着他们事先准备好的一整套破坏解释的办法的。这套办法在美方战俘营里曾经多次演习，主要的就是不许战俘个别听取解释，要求集体听取解释，然后在解释过程中故意捣乱，袭击和杀害解释代表，甚至将解释代表拖进战俘营场加以扣留。美方所谓遣返组组长汉布伦后来就根据这个计划提出了反对个别解释的要求。但是中立国遣返委员会通过的“解释和访问工作细则”却打乱了美方的这个计划。为了重新进行布置，美方不顾世界舆论的指责，用拖延重新修建解释设备把解释工作的开始推迟了二十天。据归来的朝中被俘人员说，在这期间，美方命令其派在营场中的特务疯狂地进行了破坏解释工作的各种新布置。CIE“教员”每天向战俘诵读大量恐吓性的谎言，说什么战俘如在解释帐篷申请遣返，仍将送回原营场，因此当然免不了要被打死。他们还说什么战俘如果申请遣返，只要瑞士、瑞典委员不举手，就不能生效……等等。这显然是美国“心理战”专家针对当时新通过的“工作细则”所拟定的新战术。这种战术还包括野蛮地杀害要求遣返的战俘，在战俘营和解释场所制造恐怖气氛，利用迫害过战俘的李、蒋匪帮特务充当美方的“代表”、“译员”，以便在解释帐篷中威胁战俘。
    但是美方根据他们在巨济岛上的经验知道，任何恐怖和恫吓都不可能将战俘要求遣返的愿望完全扼杀的。只要有一名战俘要求遣返，美方的强迫扣留战俘的阴谋就要彻底破产。因此他们早就准备好了在有大批战俘要求遣返的情况下武力劫夺战俘的计划。从东场里归来的被俘人员揭露：在他们被交给中立国遣返委员会看管之前，在论山等美方战俘营，自称是“联军遣俘工作方面负责人”和“交通事务方面负责人”的美国准将和少将曾威胁战俘说：“在中立国看管营地后面，我们已布下强大阵地。你们随时可以冲出来，我们将以飞机、大炮、坦克来接应你们！”美国军官并把他们的军事布置的地图发给了战俘营内的李、蒋特务。从战俘被移交给中立国遣返委员会时起，美方就不断对战俘进行军事威胁。白天，美军阵地常常发出隆隆的炮声，美军的飞机经常在东场里上空盘旋；夜间，探照灯、信号弹、坦克灯更是不断出现在东场里战俘营上空和周围。据我方民政警察统计，美国军用飞机（包括喷气式战斗机）在东场里地区出现过约二百架次，有几次直接在营场上空盘旋，探照灯、坦克灯对营场的照射在四十次以上。归来人员说，特务们曾用这些现象恫吓战俘说：他们和印度看管部队都在美军武装的包围下。
    美方所最害怕的事情终于发生了。五百多名战俘突破特务的严密控制而要求遣返，使美方的“心理战”遭到了可耻的失败。为了挽回自己的面子，美方实行了它的整个破坏“职权范围”实施的计划中的最后一步，以武力和武力威胁劫走了战俘，并立即将他们交给李、蒋匪帮充当炮灰。但是就在战俘被劫走的过程中，还是有将近一百名战俘冲出来要求遣返。这就使美方事后用来进行宣传的所谓战俘的“个人意志”、“个人自由”，显得更加臭气熏天了。
