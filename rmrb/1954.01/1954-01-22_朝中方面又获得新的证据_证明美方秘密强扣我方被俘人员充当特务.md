(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 21st) The Korean and Chinese sides have obtained new evidence proving that the U.S. military authorities are secretly holding a group of captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel and forcing them to serve as spies to gather military intelligence from our side.

Among this group of our captured personnel who were forcibly detained, another Volunteer Army prisoner of war named Zhang Jinrong (also known as Zhang Zhigang) fell into our hands. After being captured on July 16th of last year, Zhang Jinrong was taken by the U.S. side to Xianjia Island, more than 60 kilometers southwest of Incheon, and forced to undergo nearly a month of special agent training. On December 15th of last year, the U.S. special agent organization in Seoul sent him across the military demarcation line to the Jincheng area of our side to gather military intelligence.

Zhang Jinrong revealed the process by which the U.S. forced him to serve as a special agent, saying: After he was captured, he was detained in the U.S. prisoner of war camp near Yeongdeungpo. Around July 24th of last year, a U.S. military officer and a Taiwanese special agent put him and eighteen other prisoners of war, including Wang Yongxiang, a Volunteer Army prisoner of war who had previously been reported as having been forced to serve as a special agent, onto a covered truck and secretly sent them to a building in Seoul where U.S. troops were living. They were forced to take off the "P.W." marked clothes they wore in the prisoner of war camp and put on U.S. military uniforms. A U.S. Army captain told them:
	“From now on, you are no longer prisoners of war, but personnel of the United Nations forces.” That night, they were taken to Xianjia Island, more than 60 kilometers southwest of Incheon, to receive special agent training.

Zhang Jinrong said: This island houses a special agent organization of the Far East U.S. Army Headquarters. This organization is headed by a U.S. Army lieutenant, with five Taiwanese special agents and one Syngman Rhee special agent serving as "instructors." The names of three of the "instructors" are Zhang Keyi, Luo Wenbin, and Li Qi. The other two "instructors" have the surnames Zhang and Liu. This special agent organization secretly detains more than 160 Volunteer Army prisoners of war.

Zhang Jinrong said: The U.S. side never told them about the repatriation of prisoners of war after the Korean armistice or the transfer of non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to neutral nations for supervision. In mid-August of last year, a U.S. Army major came to the island to inspect and said to them: "You should serve the Allied forces well here. In the future, the U.S. government will introduce you to Taiwan, and the Taiwan government will definitely treat you well." Later, a U.S. Army captain from Seoul forcibly took a frontal and a profile photograph of each of the twenty-five prisoners of war, including Zhang Jinrong, and forced them to put their fingerprints on a piece of paper printed with English words. In this special agent organization, they were forced to undergo nearly a month of special agent training. The Taiwanese special agent "instructor" Zhang Keyi and others taught them how to gather military intelligence and how to cross the military demarcation line.

Zhang Jinrong said: On November 3rd, he and five other prisoners of war were taken to a special agent organization in Seoul. This special agent organization was in a Western-style building on a small hill near Seodaemun in Seoul, and was headed by the U.S. Army captain who had come to Xianjia Island to take their photos. The telephone number of this special agent organization was 216. Later, they were moved to a mountain valley in Seongbuk-dong, Samsencheon, Seoul. In this special agent organization, Zhang Jinrong saw more than twenty Volunteer Army prisoners of war, including Mao Hanyun, who had been transferred from Xianjia Island earlier, and they were being forced to carry out special agent work. In addition, six of our captured personnel, including Yang Shuzhi and Chen Jinyang, were being forced to undergo training in the use of radio telegraph machines.

Zhang Jinrong said: On December 15th of last year, a Syngman Rhee special agent named Li, who understood Chinese, in this special agent organization forced him to go to the Jincheng area of our side to gather military intelligence. This special agent made him put on a set of forged Volunteer Army uniforms and gave him eight forged Volunteer Army identification documents and a compass. At 7 p.m. that day, a U.S. military officer escorted him to the southern edge of the demilitarized zone south of Changzhi Mountain in Jincheng, gave him a Tommy gun, and ordered him to cross the military demarcation line to our area.

The facts prove that the U.S. side is not only openly and on a large scale forcibly detaining our captured personnel, but also secretly detaining a large number of our captured personnel. Four months ago, our side submitted to the U.S. side a list including 98,742 forcibly detained Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, but the U.S. side has so far failed to provide a responsible explanation.

### 朝中方面又获得新的证据  证明美方秘密强扣我方被俘人员充当特务

    朝中方面又获得新的证据
    证明美方秘密强扣我方被俘人员充当特务
    【新华社开城二十一日电】朝中方面又获得新的证据，证明美军当局手里还秘密扣留着一批中国人民志愿军被俘人员，并且强迫他们充当刺探我方军事情报的特务。
    在这批被强迫扣留的我方被俘人员中，又有一名名叫张金荣（又名张志刚）的志愿军被俘人员落在我方手里。张金荣在去年七月十六日被俘以后，被美方押到仁川西南六十多公里的仙甲岛上强迫受了近一个月特务训练。去年十二月十五日，在汉城的美方特务机关派遣他越过军事分界线，到我方地区的金城一带刺探军事情报。
    张金荣揭露美方强迫他充当特务的经过说：他被俘以后，被拘留在永登浦附近的美方战俘营中。去年七月二十四日左右，一个美国军官和一个台湾特务把他和前已报道的被强迫充当特务的志愿军被俘人员王永祥等十八名战俘押上一辆带篷的卡车秘密地送到汉城市内一座住着美军的楼房里，并且强迫他们脱下在战俘营中穿的带有“P·W·”字样的衣服，换上美军军服。一个美军上尉对他们说：
  “从今以后你们已不是战俘，而是联合国军的人员了。”当天晚上，他们就被押到了仁川西南六十多公里的仙甲岛上去受特务训练。
    张金荣说：这个岛上设有远东美军总司令部的一个特务机关。这个机关由一个美军中尉负责，有五个台湾特务和一个李承晚特务充当“教官”。其中三个“教官”的名字是张克义、罗文宾、李奇。另外二个“教官”一个姓张，一个姓刘。在这个特务机关里秘密扣留着约有一百六十余个志愿军被俘人员。
    张金荣说：美方从来没有告诉过他们有关朝鲜停战后遣返战俘及把不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国看管的事情。去年八月中旬，一个美军少校来岛上视察时对他们说：“你们在这里好好地为联军服务。将来美国政府介绍你们到台湾去，台湾政府一定会很好地看待你们。”后来，有一个从汉城来的美军上尉强迫给张金荣等二十五个战俘每人照了一张正面的和一张侧面的像片，并且强迫他们每人在一张印着英文字的纸上按了指印。他们在这个特务机关里被强迫受了近一个月的特务训练，由台湾来的特务“教官”张克义等教给他们怎样刺探军事情报和怎样越过军事分界线。
    张金荣说：十一月三日，他和另外五个战俘被押送到汉城的一个特务机关里。这个特务机关在汉城西大门附近一座小山上的洋楼里，由以前到仙甲岛上来给他们照像的一个美军上尉负责。这个特务机关的电话号码是二一六。后来，他们又被迁移到汉城三仙桥城北洞的一条山沟里去住。在这个特务机关里，张金荣见到了早些时候从仙甲岛上调来的毛汉云等二十多名志愿军被俘人员，他们正被迫执行着特务工作。另外有杨树芝、陈锦阳等六名我方被俘人员正被迫受使用无线电报机的训练。
    张金荣说：去年十二月十五日，这个特务机关里的一个懂中国话的姓李的李承晚特务强迫他到我方地区的金城一带刺探军事情报。这个特务分子要他换上一套伪造的志愿军军服，并且给他八份伪造的志愿军证明文件和一枚指南针。当天下午七时，一个美军军官把他押送到金城西南长芝山以南的非军事区南缘，交给他一支汤姆手枪，就命令他越过军事分界线到我方地区来。
    事实证明：美方不但公开大规模地强迫扣留我方被俘人员，而且还秘密扣留了大批我方被俘人员。在四个月以前，我方已向美方提出一份包括九万八千七百四十二名被强迫扣留的朝中被俘人员的名单，但是美方至今未能作出负责交代。
