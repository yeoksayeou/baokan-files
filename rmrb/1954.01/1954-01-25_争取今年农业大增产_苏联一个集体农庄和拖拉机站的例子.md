Strive for a Great Increase in Agricultural Production This Year
—An Example from a Soviet Collective Farm and Tractor Station
By Li He, Our Correspondent in Moscow

The resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on measures for the further development of agriculture has been constantly inspiring the people and agricultural laborers throughout the Soviet Union. Millions of collective farmers in the Soviet Union, with the help of tractor station workers, are striving for a great increase in agricultural production in 1954. The Stalin Collective Farm in Novoalexandrovsky District, Stavropol Krai, and the Grigoropoliss Machine Tractor Station that serves it, are an example. The Presidium of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation recently discussed and praised their efforts and methods for achieving a large increase in production.

Like the large collective farms in the Soviet Union after the mergers, the Stalin Collective Farm relies on the help of tractor stations and demonstrates strong productive power. The Stalin Collective Farm permanently uses 22,000 hectares of state-owned land, of which 18,000 hectares are cultivated. It has seven production teams, all engaged in both farming and animal husbandry, and one production team engaged in orchards and vegetable gardens. Each production team has 115 to 230 members, 1,660 to 3,400 hectares of land, necessary production buildings, livestock, farm implements, and transportation vehicles. Crop rotation is used in the cultivated land. The Grigoropoliss Machine Tractor Station, which serves the collective farm, sends eight tractor teams to serve each production team on a fixed basis. Each tractor team uses ten to seventeen tractors and five to eight combine harvesters. The tractor station has become the decisive force in the collective farm's production. Last year, the tractors did 100,600 hectares of cultivated land work, that is, six hectares of cultivated land work per hectare of cultivated land. The cultivation of fallow land and ploughed land, and the sowing of grains, row crops, and industrial crops in the collective farm are completely mechanized. One hundred percent of grains and sunflowers, and sixty-seven percent of corn, are harvested by combine harvesters.

The Stalin Collective Farm was merged in 1950. The merger brought about a huge development in production. Grain yield increased from 910 kilograms per hectare in 1950 to 1,900 kilograms in 1953; sunflower—from 490 kilograms to 1,640 kilograms. In these three years, the number of cattle increased by a quarter, including a 50% increase in the number of cows; pigs increased by two times; sheep increased by one time; and the amount of milk produced per cow increased by more than one time. The collective farm completes the state's purchasing obligations ahead of schedule every year, pays the tractor station's in-kind remuneration for its work in a timely manner, continuously increases the public fund, and supplies the state, cooperatives, and collective farm markets with more and more products. The collective farm's cash income has increased fivefold in the last three years. The remuneration for each labor day of the members was 1 ruble and 30 kopecks and 1.3 kilograms of grain in 1950, and increased to 7 rubles and 3.5 kilograms of grain in 1953. However, the collective farm has not developed sufficiently in terms of animal products, vegetables, and potatoes, and there is still full potential to be exploited.

1954 has arrived, and the Stalin Collective Farm and the tractor station that serves it have set the goal of comprehensively increasing production; striving to greatly increase the yield of agricultural and livestock products in all aspects, calculated per 100 hectares of cultivated land, grassland, and pasture. Comparing this year with last year: grain will increase from 154,600 quintals to 200,000 quintals, an increase of 29.3 percent; sunflower will increase from 19,670 quintals to 25,000 quintals, an increase of more than 27 percent; potatoes, vegetables, and melons will increase from 18,210 quintals to 42,740 quintals, an increase of more than 134 percent; milk will increase from 11,352 quintals to 17,300 quintals, an increase of 52.4 percent; meat will increase from 2,600 quintals to 6,200 quintals, an increase of approximately 139 percent; wool will increase from 292 quintals to 400 quintals, an increase of approximately 37 percent; eggs will increase from 830,000 to 2,000,000, an increase of 140 percent; the increased production ensures that the collective farm's cash income will increase from 12.8 million rubles to 20 million rubles, that is, the cash income per 100 hectares of cultivated land, grassland, and pasture will increase from 58,000 rubles to 90,000 rubles. Each of these figures shows how strong the economic power of the Soviet collective farm is, and how great the efforts they are making this year.

In order to achieve the goal of a great increase in agricultural production this year, the Stalin Collective Farm, with the help of the Grigoropoliss Machine Tractor Station, will take many appropriate measures. In animal husbandry, they will consolidate the feed base, strengthen the supply of feed and forage, increase the number of cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens, especially cows and fine-wool sheep, add livestock sheds, improve the mechanization of animal husbandry work, and so on. In this way, the number of cattle will increase from 1,936 in 1953 to 2,130 in 1954, of which the number of cows will increase from 647 to 772. The number of sheep will increase from 10,242 in 1953 to 15,200 in 1954, and the average amount of wool sheared from each sheep will increase to 4.3 kilograms. The number of pigs will increase from 3,323 in 1953 to 4,000 in 1954, and will supply 4,500 quintals of live weight pork.

In terms of grain and industrial crops, the collective farm and the machine tractor station will rely on hard work, sufficient machines, and advanced agricultural technology to increase yield per unit area. More than 6,000 hectares of winter wheat have been sown with selected seeds. In such a large area, it is required that the average harvest of winter wheat be 2,200 kilograms per hectare. All winter wheat land will be harrowed once in early spring with thirty crawler tractors within three days. One hundred to one hundred and fifty kilograms of superphosphate (fertilizer) will be applied to each hectare of wheat land before harrowing. Spring-sown crops will be completely sown on ploughed land with selected seeds suitable for the growth of this area, of which row crops will be planted on ploughed land reaching a depth of 27 to 30 cm. One thousand two hundred and forty hectares of spring-sown grains will be sown with thirty narrow-row seeders within three days. It is required that the average harvest of barley be 2,400 kilograms per hectare, and oats be 2,100 kilograms. At the same time as sowing barley and oats, fifty kilograms of granular superphosphate will be applied per hectare.

The tractor station and the collective farm have been using the square cluster planting method since 1951. The area sown with this advanced method has increased year by year. This year, 935 hectares of corn, 1,342 hectares of sunflowers, and more than 900 hectares of vegetables and potatoes will be sown using this method. It is required that the average harvest of corn be 2,500 kilograms per hectare, and sunflowers be 1,800 kilograms. This year's harvesting work will be better organized. All grains and forage will be harvested by machines. Forty-four combine harvesters will be used to harvest the entire grain area on a large scale within twelve or thirteen days. The grain unloaded from the combine harvester to the mechanized threshing floor will be threshed immediately and sent to the state purchasing station and the collective farm granary. Since the tractor station has added hay-stacking machines, all hay-stacking work will be mechanized. The collective farm has already prepared 1,600 tons of mineral fertilizers and 7,000 tons of organic fertilizers this spring.

The cadre of the tractor station has been strengthened. The existing personnel are sufficient for the tractor to work in two shifts. Each tractor team has a mechanic. All tractor drivers have improved their proficiency. Among them, 180 people have mastered three or four skills. At the beginning of the year, 68 tractor drivers and combine harvester drivers will be trained in mechanical schools. Tractor drivers, combine harvester drivers, etc., will help the collective farm build livestock sheds and other important production tasks before the field work begins. An agronomist from the tractor station works in each production team of the collective farm, and a livestock technician works in seven production teams. This year, the tractor station will repair tractors and other agricultural machines all year round. Minor repairs and technical care will be carried out at the repair shops in the field rest station. All tractor teams will establish this type of rest station and repair shop this year.

In the struggle for increased agricultural production, the workers of the Stalin Collective Farm and the Grigoropoliss Machine Tractor Station often visit advanced collective farms, tractor stations, and state farms, and widely absorb their good experiences.

After the measures to achieve a large increase in production are implemented, the public economy and the welfare of the members of this collective farm will be further developed. The remuneration for each labor day of the members is expected to be no less than three kilograms of grain, some feed, and eleven rubles in cash this year. The farm will help the members repair their houses and private plots. All members' houses will be equipped with electric lights, and running water pipes will be installed in the village. A sanatorium for the members will be established this year, and the agricultural and cultural center will be expanded. A large number of members will be organized to participate in the branch of the agricultural secondary technical school and the correspondence agricultural college.

The efforts of the Stalin Collective Farm and the Grigoropoliss Machine Tractor Station to strive for a large increase in agricultural production, and the joint efforts of thousands of collective farms and machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union today to strive for a new upsurge in agriculture, have merged into such a huge force, which shows the unparalleled superiority of the collectivized and mechanized socialist agricultural system, and it shows the broad prospects for the development of socialist agriculture.

    争取今年农业大增产
    ——苏联一个集体农庄和拖拉机站的例子
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李　何
    苏联共产党中央九月全会关于进一步发展农业的措施的决议，一直鼓舞着全苏联的人民和全苏联的农业劳动者。苏联的千百万集体农民，在拖拉机站工人的帮助下，开展着争取在一九五四年农业大增产的努力。斯塔甫罗波尔边疆诺沃亚历山得罗夫区斯大林集体农庄，和为它服务的格里高罗波里斯机器拖拉机站，便是一个例子。俄罗斯联邦农业部部务会议最近讨论和赞许了它们争取大增产的努力和办法。
    像苏联一般合并后的大集体农庄一样，斯大林集体农庄依靠着拖拉机站的帮助，在生产上表现着雄厚的力量。斯大林集体农庄永久使用着二万二千公顷国有土地，其中一万八千公顷是耕地。它有七个生产队，都是种地兼饲畜，还有一个经营果园和蔬菜的生产队。每个生产队各拥有一百十五到二百三十个庄员，一千六百六十到三千四百公顷的土地，必需的生产建筑物、牲畜、农具、运输工具。耕地采用轮作制。为集体农庄服务的格里高罗波里斯机器拖拉机站，派出八个拖拉机队固定地为每个生产队服务。每个拖拉机队使用着十台到十七台拖拉机，五台到八台的联合收割机。拖拉机站成为集体农庄生产的决定性力量。去年拖拉机做了十万零六千公顷耕熟地的工作，即在每公顷耕地上做了六公顷耕熟地的工作。集体农庄内休闲地和翻耕地的耕作，谷物、中耕作物和技术作物的播种，完全是机械化的。百分之百的谷物和向日葵，百分之六十七的玉米，是用联合收割机收割的。
    斯大林集体农庄是在一九五○年合并的。合并带来了生产的巨大发展。谷物收获量从一九五○年的每公顷九百一十公斤提高到一九五三年的一千九百公斤；向日葵——从四百九十公斤提高到一千六百四十公斤。在这三年中，牛的头数增加了四分之一，其中母牛增加了半倍；猪增加了两倍；羊增加了一倍；每头母牛的挤乳量增加了一倍多。集体农庄每年提前完成国家的采购义务，及时付偿拖拉机站工作的实物报酬，不断增加公共基金，供给国家、合作社和集体农庄市场越来越多的产品。集体农庄的现金收入在最近三年中增加了五倍。庄员的每个劳动日报酬在一九五○年为一卢布三十哥比和一·三公斤谷物，在一九五三年提高到七个卢布和三公斤半谷物。但是集体农庄在畜产品、蔬菜、马铃薯这些方面发展得还不够，还有充分的潜在力可以发挥。
    一九五四年到来了，斯大林集体农庄和为它服务的拖拉机站提出了全面增产的目标；争取以每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场计算，在农产品和畜产品各方面都大大提高产量。以今年与去年比较：谷物将从十五万四千六百公担增加到二十万公担，即增产百分之二十九·三；向日葵将从一万九千六百七十公担增加到二万五千公担，即增产百分之二十七强；马铃薯、蔬菜、瓜类从一万八千二百一十公担增加到四万二千七百四十公担，即增产百分之一三四强；牛乳从一万一千三百五十二公担增加到一万七千三百公担，即增加百分之五十二·四；肉类从二千六百公担增加到六千二百公担，即增产约百分之一三九；毛从二百九十二公担增加到四百公担，即增产约百分之三十七；鸡蛋从八十三万个增加到二百万个，即增产百分之一四○；以增产保证集体农庄的现金收入从一千二百八十万卢布增加到二千万卢布，即在每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场上现金收入从五万八千卢布增加到九万卢布。这些数字的每一项都说明着：苏联集体农庄的经济力量是多么雄厚，它们今年所作的努力是多么巨大。
    为了实现今年农业大增产的目标，斯大林集体农庄在格里高罗波里斯机器拖拉机站的帮助下，将采取许多适当的办法。在饲畜业方面，它们将巩固饲料基地，加强饲料和牧草的供应，增殖牛羊猪鸡，特别是母牛和细毛羊，添建畜舍，提高饲畜工作的机械化，等等。这样，牛的数目将从一九五三年一千九百三十六头增加到一九五四年二千一百三十头，其中母牛将从六百四十七头增加到七百七十二头。羊的数目将从一九五三年一万零二百四十二只增加到一九五四年一万五千二百只，从每只羊身上剪的毛平均将增加到四·三公斤。猪的数目将从一九五三年三千三百二十三头增加到一九五四年四千头，将供给活重四千五百公担的猪肉。
    在谷物和技术作物方面，集体农庄和机器拖拉机站将依靠辛勤的劳动、充足的机器和先进的农业技术来提高单位面积产量。用选好的种籽播种了六千多公顷冬小麦。在这样大的面积上，要求每公顷平均收获二千二百公斤冬小麦。所有冬小麦地在初春将用三十台履带拖拉机在三天内耙一遍。在耙地前每公顷麦地将施一百到一百五十公斤过磷酸盐
  （肥料）。春种作物将用选好的适宜于本区生长的种籽完全播种在翻耕地上，其中中耕作物将种在深达二十七到三十公分的翻耕地上。一千二百四十公顷春种谷物将用三十台窄行播种机在三天内种好。要求大麦每公顷平均收获二千四百公斤，燕麦二千一百公斤。在播种大麦和燕麦的同时，每公顷将施五十公斤粒状过磷酸盐。
    拖拉机站和集体农庄从一九五一年开始采用方形簇种法。这种先进方法播种的面积一年年增长。今年将用此法播种九百三十五公顷玉米，一千三百四十二公顷向日葵，九百多公顷蔬菜和马铃薯。要求玉米每公顷平均收获二千五百公斤，向日葵一千八百公斤。今年的收割工作将更好地加以组织。所有谷物和牧草，都将用机器收割。将用四十四台联合收割机，在十二、三天内收割了广大面积的全部谷物。谷物从收割机卸到机械化的打谷场，将立刻脱好谷，送到国家采购站和集体农庄谷仓。由于拖拉机站增添了垛草机器，全部垛草工作将机械化，集体农庄今年春天已经准备了一千六百吨矿质肥料和七千吨有机肥料。
    拖拉机站的干部加强了。现有的人员足够拖拉机两班工作。每个拖拉机组有机械士。所有拖拉机手都提高了熟练程度。其中一百八十个人掌握了三、四门技艺。年初在机械学校将培养出六十八个拖拉机手和联合收割机手。拖拉机手和联合收割机手等在田间工作开始之前将帮助集体农庄修建畜舍等重要生产工作。在集体农庄的每个生产队中都有拖拉机站的农艺师工作，在七个生产队中都有饲畜技师工作。今年拖拉机站将常年修理拖拉机和其他的农业机器。小修理和技术照料将在田间休息站的修理处进行。今年所有拖拉机队都要建立这种休息站和修理处。
    斯大林集体农庄和格里高罗波里斯机器拖拉机站的劳动者，在争取农业增产中，经常访问先进的集体农庄、拖拉机站和国营农场，广泛地吸取它们的好经验。
    在实现大增产的办法之后，这个集体农庄将更加发展公共经济和庄员的福利。庄员的每个劳动日报酬预计今年将不少于三公斤谷物，一些饲料和十一卢布现金。农庄将帮助庄员修缮房舍和宅旁园地。所有庄员房屋都将装置电灯，村内将安设自来水管。今年将建立庄员休养所，将扩建农业文化之家。将组织大批庄员参加农业中等技术学校分校和函授的农学院学习。
    斯大林集体农庄和格里高罗波里斯机器拖拉机站争取农业大增产的这些努力，和苏联今天成千成万集体农庄和机器拖拉机站争取农业新高涨的共同努力，汇成这样巨大的力量，它显示着集体化和机械化了的社会主义农业制度的无比优越，它显示着社会主义农业发展的广阔前途。
