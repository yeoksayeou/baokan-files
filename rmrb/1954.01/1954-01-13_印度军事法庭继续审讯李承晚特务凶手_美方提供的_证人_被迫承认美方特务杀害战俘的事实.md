    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 10th: Major Hume, a medical officer of the Indian Custodial Forces, appeared before the Indian Military Tribunal today to testify in the case of the Syngman Rhee special agents who murdered four Korean POWs in Camp 38 who wished to be repatriated. This medical officer was responsible for examining the bodies on December 14th, two days after the bodies of the victims were discovered by the Indian Custodial Forces.
    Major Hume said that the examination of Choi Jong-jun's body showed that the deceased had bled from the mouth, nose, and eyes. He said there were dark bruises around the neck and on the upper part of the body. Major Hume found bleeding in both lungs of the victim and in the stomach, which contained undigested food. He said, "I believe the cause of death was suffocation due to strangulation."
    Major Hume's judgment was fully consistent with the testimony of three other witnesses. They told the court that Choi Jong-jun was strangled with a rope and trampled to death after being knocked to the ground.
    The witnesses stated in court that one of the three special agent assassins on trial was the one who put the rope around Choi Jong-jun's neck and stomped on his chest. Another "Deputy Battalion Commander" was the one who took Choi Jong-jun into the tent to be murdered. Another so-called "Camp Leader" openly told the Indian Custodial Forces at the entrance of the camp after the murder: "We killed them." A fourth assassin, who participated in trampling Choi Jong-jun's body, did not appear in court due to illness.
    Tomorrow, the so-called "witnesses" of these special agent assassins will appear in court to provide fabricated evidence in an attempt to save these assassins who used violence to kill POWs who wished to be repatriated, at the instigation of the United States. The American "defense lawyers" have been instructing these "witnesses" for the past few weeks to defend these assassins.
   Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 11th: The first "witness" brought by the American "defense lawyers" to the Indian Military Tribunal admitted today that four Korean People's Army POWs who wished to be repatriated were killed in Camp 38 of the South Camp. This put the "defense lawyers" who were defending the accused murderers in a very awkward position.
    This "witness" admitted the above when questioned by the prosecutor. The prosecutor asked him: "Where are those four people now?" The "witness" replied: "They are the people who were killed on the night of December 12th." About two hours later, he tried to deny it, saying: "They died on their own, without being punished."
    He also told the court that the four murdered POWs had been tattooed, and another POW who had escaped had also been tattooed.
    This "witness," with a radiant complexion and a plump face, stood in the witness box, and many officials and journalists from neutral countries did not believe he was a POW. He couldn't even tell the number of his unit. He said he went to the police station to surrender himself. The prosecutor asked him: "Before you surrendered, which unit did you belong to?" The "witness" replied: "I don't know." But he later said that he had only stayed in the North Korean army for a month, but he "had no weapons." This sentence caused a burst of laughter.
    He said that after the Indian Custodial Forces arrested the camp "leader" related to the murder of POW Choi Jong-jun (note: this person is now on trial), he became the acting "leader" of Camp 38. He said: "I took over his position without holding an election." This shattered the American lie: that "POW leaders" were elected by the POWs themselves.
   The "witness" admitted in court that Syngman Rhee's special agents had their own guards in Camp 38. The presiding officer asked: "Was the responsibility of these guards to prevent POWs from escaping?" The "witness" said: "Yes."
    Witnesses for the prosecution testified in previous days that the U.S. Army used violence to prevent POWs from demanding repatriation during "screening" in South Korean POW camps. The American "defense lawyer" Morrison tried to prove this was not true today, questioning the "defendant witness": "Did the POWs have the opportunity to decide whether they wanted to stay in South Korea or go to North Korea?" The "defendant witness" replied: "Some POWs did not get the opportunity."
    At the beginning of the court session this morning, Morrison requested that two defendants—a "Deputy Battalion Commander" and a "Battalion Commander"—be acquitted because "no evidence could be presented" against them. The prosecutor said: "There is evidence against them." He said that one person took Choi Jong-jun into the tent to be murdered, and the other person told the Indian officers: "We have killed them." The court rejected Morrison's request.
    Three American reporters attended the trial for the first time today, but they soon left because they found that even a defendant "witness" was revealing evidence unfavorable to the U.S. military.
    The trial will continue tomorrow morning.

### 印度军事法庭继续审讯李承晚特务凶手  美方提供的“证人”被迫承认美方特务杀害战俘的事实

    印度军事法庭继续审讯李承晚特务凶手
    美方提供的“证人”被迫承认美方特务杀害战俘的事实
    【新华社开城十日电】印度看管部队的军医胡姆少校今日出席印度军事法庭，为李匪特务杀害第三十八号营场四名希望遣返的朝鲜战俘的案件作证。这位军医曾在十二月十四日，即被害者的尸体为印度看管部队发现后两天，负责检验这些尸体。
    胡姆少校说，检验崔钟俊的尸体表明，死者的口、鼻和眼睛都流了血。他说，在脖颈周围和身体的上部都有暗伤。胡姆少校在被害者的两肺和有着未消化食物的胃都发现有出血现象。他说：“我认为致死的原因是由于绞窄而至窒息死亡。”
    胡姆少校的判断与另外三位证人的证辞完全吻合。他们向法庭说，崔钟俊是被用绳子勒住了脖子，又被摔倒在地上踩踏而死的。
    证人们在法庭上当场提出，出庭受审的三个特务凶手中的一个就是用绳子套住崔钟俊脖子和用脚踩踏他的胸部的人。另外一名“大队副”就是把崔钟俊带到帐篷里去杀害的人。还有一名所谓“营场领袖”，他在谋杀案发生以后，在营场门口公然向印度看管部队说：“我们杀死了他们。”参加踩踏崔钟俊身体的第四名凶手因病未出庭。
    明天，这些特务凶手的所谓“证人”将出庭提供伪造的证据，企图挽救这些美国指使的用暴力杀害希望遣返的战俘的凶手。美国“辩护律师”过去几周来一直在训令这些“证人”为这些凶手辩护。
   【新华社开城十一日电】美国的“辩护律师”带到印度军事法庭上去的第一个“证人”今天承认四名希望遣返的朝鲜人民军战俘被杀死在南营的第三十八号营场内。这件事使得那些为受审讯的杀人犯辩护的“辩护律师”狼狈不堪。
    这个“证人”是在受检察官盘问的时候承认上面这件事的。检察官问他：“现在那四个人在那里？”“证人”回答说：“他们就是在十二月十二日夜里被杀死的人。”大约两小时以后，他又企图抵赖说：“他们是自己死的，没有受刑罚。”
    他并且告诉法庭说，那四个被杀害的战俘身上都被刺过字，另外一个逃跑了的战俘身上也被刺过字。
    这个“证人”容光焕发、脸孔胖胖的，他站在证人栏内时，许多中立国的官员和新闻记者都不相信他是一个战俘。他甚至说不出他所属的部队的番号。他说，他是到警察局去自首的。检察官问他：“在你自首以前，你是属于那个部队的？”“证人”回答说：“我不知道。”但是他后来说，他在北朝鲜军队中只呆了一个月，可是，他“没有武器”。这句话引起了哄堂大笑。
    他说，在印度看管部队逮捕了与谋杀战俘崔钟俊一案有关的营场“领袖”以后（按此人现在正在受审判），他就成了第三十八号营场的代理“领袖”。他说：“没有举行选举，我就接替了他的职务”。这句话就粉碎了美国的谎言：“战俘领袖们”是由战俘们自己选举出来的。
   “证人”当场在法庭承认：李承晚特务在三十八号营场有他们自己的警卫。主审的军官问道：“这些警卫的责任是不是防止战俘逃走？”“证人”说：“是的。”
    检察官方面的证人在以往几天作证时说：美国陆军在南朝鲜战俘营进行“甄别”的时候，曾使用暴力阻止战俘要求遣返。美国的“辩护律师”摩里逊今天企图证明这个事实不确实，他质问“被告证人”说：“战俘们是不是有决定他要留在南朝鲜或到北朝鲜去的机会？”被告“证人”回答说：“有些战俘没有得到机会。”
    在今日上午法庭一开审的时候，摩里逊就要求把两个被告——一个“大队副”和一个“大队长”——无罪开释，因为对他们“提不出证据”。检察官说：“对他们是有证据的。”他说，一个人把崔钟俊领到帐篷里去杀害，另一个人对印度军官们说过：“我们已杀死了他们。”法庭驳斥了摩里逊的请求。
    三个美国记者今天第一次出席这次审讯，但他们不久就离去了，因为他们发现甚至一个被告“证人”也透露了对美国军方不利的证据。
    审讯将于明日上午继续进行。
