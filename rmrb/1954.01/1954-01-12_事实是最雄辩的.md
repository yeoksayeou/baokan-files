Facts Speak Louder Than Words
    Hu Jin
    The American side has consistently engaged in rampant lying and sophistry, attempting to conceal its criminal activities of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. However, facts speak louder than words, and the American side and its professional liars are destined to be thoroughly bankrupted in the face of facts.

    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's "Interim Report" provides more systematic facts and arguments, confirming what the Korean-Chinese side and our returning personnel have revealed: The US side and the Li-Chiang secret agents it had deployed tore up the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Operating Procedures for Explanation and Interview Work," undermined the explanation work, paralyzed the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and prevented our captured personnel from exercising their right to repatriation.

    After the United Nations Command Commander Hull unilaterally declared the explanation period "expired" on December 23rd last year, he attempted to shift the responsibility for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces' inability to perform their duties due to obstruction and sabotage by US agents onto the Korean-Chinese side, and hypocritically "praised" the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian forces, which had been repeatedly ridiculed by the US side, saying: "They have steadfastly adhered to the provisions imposed upon them by the Terms of Reference." However, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's "Interim Report" was nothing less than a resounding slap in the face to Hull, indicating that it was difficult to accept this fox-like "praise." The "Interim Report" pointed out that due to the terrorist and sabotage activities carried out by Li-Chiang secret agents in the US-controlled Tongjang-ni POW camp, "the Commission itself was under the rule of threat and intimidation by the Republic of Korea, further increasing the Commission's difficulties." The conclusion also stated: "These activities weakened the Commission's custody and control, and made it extremely difficult for the Commission to establish the freedom of choice for prisoners of war at any time."

    The fact is that the American aggressors, for more than two years, used all kinds of bloody persecution against our captured personnel under their direct detention, and used Li-Chiang secret agents to implement terrorist rule, in an attempt to achieve their goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. However, after the signing of the Armistice Agreement, according to this agreement, the US side's control and influence over our captured personnel had to be lifted, and our captured personnel transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian forces; therefore, in addition to perfidiously condoning the illegal "release" of more than 27,000 of our captured personnel by the Syngman Rhee clique in June last year, it tried its best to obstruct and undermine the authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, making it unable to guarantee the freedom of the 22,000-plus of our captured personnel under its custody to return home and live a peaceful life in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and "Detailed Operating Procedures."

    The "Interim Report" lists various facts of the US side directly and indirectly obstructing and undermining the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    The most vicious and illegal means by which the US side deliberately forced the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission into a state of paralysis was to transfer the Li-Chiang secret agent organization, which it had established in the US POW camps from the beginning to control and persecute our captured personnel, intact into the Tongjang-ni POW camp, usurping the control power and status of the Indian forces and becoming the actual ruler, turning the Tongjang-ni POW camp into a nest of Li-Chiang secret agents controlling prisoners of war, a prison where our captured personnel were persecuted and slaughtered.

    From the beginning, our side proposed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to disrupt the secret agent organization deployed by the US side into the Tongjang-ni POW camp, and protested to the US side at the Military Armistice Commission, but the US chief commissioner Lacy repeatedly denied this fact with shamelessness, and some members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, such as the Swiss and Swedish members, also distorted the Geneva Convention, chiming in that this evil secret agent organization was a "POW organization" that could be tolerated. However, countless bloody facts prove that this secret agent organization was not only planned and deployed by the US side, but also directly followed the instructions of the US side and the Li-Chiang bandit gang to implement illegal organizations for the violent rule of prisoners of war. The "Interim Report" stated: "There is the existence of the headquarters of the POW organization (i.e., the Li-Chiang secret agent organization), and it shows that the headquarters is located in Seoul and is controlled by the Commander of the ROK Military Police. This headquarters is linked to the four branch organizations controlling the six POW compounds. The branch organizations control the compound organizations in all fifty-five compounds. There is an effective communication system working between these three layers of organizations, and the United Nations Command's 64th Field Hospital constitutes the most important link in this communication system."

    It was this Li-Chiang secret agent organization directly commanded by the US "hospital" that put our captured personnel under a horrifying bloody rule. Our captured personnel in the compound were beaten and killed as long as they expressed their desire to return home, and their freedom to listen to explanations and apply for repatriation was completely deprived. The provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and "Detailed Operating Procedures" concerning the protection of these rights of our captured personnel have been completely undermined. The "Interim Report" stated that our captured personnel in the compound "did not enjoy the freedom to seek repatriation and were under force or threat of force"; even those few prisoners of war who listened to the explanations were subjected to "force or threat of force from the POW camp organization and its leaders, and in close contact with the POW camp organization and its leaders."

    The "Interim Report" completely exposed the shameful lies of the US side, which constantly claimed to respect the "individual freedom" and "voluntary repatriation" of prisoners of war. In its reply to former United Nations Command Commander Clark on October 7th last year, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission pointed out: "Not a single prisoner of war in the camp dares to openly demand repatriation. They must do so secretly, or risk being killed or injured by other prisoners of war (i.e., secret agent forces), or risk being shot dead on the barbed wire by armed guards. The abnormal manner in which prisoners of war must express their wishes naturally makes people suspect that all prisoners of war are not free individuals."

    Hull, in his statement on December 23, 1953, shamelessly slandered our side for "sabotaging the explanations to the non-repatriated prisoners of war." However, the "Interim Report's" narrative of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's arrangements for explanation work and the progress of past explanation work proves that it was the US side and the Li-Chiang secret agent forces under its direction that obstructed and undermined the explanation work.

    The US side had insulted the "Detailed Operating Procedures" drafted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in accordance with Article 8 and Item D of that article of the "Terms of Reference" with a barbarous attitude, and then instructed Li-Chiang secret agents to undermine the "Detailed Operating Procedures," making it impossible for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to smoothly arrange for our side to have the freedom and convenience to conduct explanation work. According to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," there should be ninety days of explanation time, but our explanation work was officially started twenty days late due to the US side's delay in building the explanation camp, and then the US side instructed Li-Chiang secret agents to interrupt the explanation work five times for a total of sixty days. Our actual explanation work only lasted for ten days, less than eight hours each day, so that less than 15 percent of the 22,000-plus of our captured personnel heard the explanation, and nearly 20,000 people failed to hear the explanation.

    The "Interim Report's" description of the reasons for the five interruptions of the explanation work shows that the first (October 16) and second (October 18 to 30) interruptions of the explanation work were caused by Syngman Rhee's agents preventing the Korean People's Army prisoners of war from coming out to listen to the explanation. The third (November 2) interruption was also caused by US agents opposing our side's radio explanation. At that time, the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had rightfully demanded to disrupt the secret agent organization and use force to bring out prisoners of war to listen to the explanation when necessary, and the Indian delegation also believed that the US agents' obstruction of prisoners of war from listening to the explanation was "illegal" and "force could be used to overcome this resistance." The fourth (November 6 to 15) and fifth (November 17 to December 20) long-term interruptions of the explanation work were due to US agents opposing the segregation of prisoners of war who had heard the explanation from those who had not, making it impossible for our explanation work to proceed.

    The "Interim Report" shows that the arrogant activities of Li-Chiang secret agents undermining the explanation work were carried out entirely in accordance with the will of the US side. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission "also noted that the opinions of the United Nations Command coincide with the opinions put forward by the prisoners of war 'representatives' (i.e., Li-Chiang secret agents), and these prisoners of war 'representatives' continue to show hostility to the explanations."

    Therefore, under the circumstances that US agents recklessly obstructed and undermined the explanation work, the number of our captured personnel who applied for repatriation without explanation was much larger than the total number of those who applied for repatriation after explanation. That is to say, our captured personnel had to risk their lives even more to rush out of the death camp to apply for repatriation, including those like returning personnel Wang Xianzhang, who was sentenced to death, dug a pit to bury him alive, and then climbed out of the barbed wire; or like returning personnel Lu Jinliang, who could only pretend to see a doctor to apply for repatriation; or it was because the Indian forces took effective measures to control secret agents, such as the investigation of the Zhang Zilong massacre in Compound 28, that many prisoners of war asked to testify and ask for repatriation to gain freedom. As for those of our captured personnel who applied for repatriation while listening to the explanation, they also had to risk their lives to apply for repatriation under the terrorist threat of US agents inside and outside the explanation tent, such as returning personnel Yue Heidan, who could not help being frightened in the explanation tent for three hours before applying for repatriation; returning personnel Wang Shan also applied for repatriation only when he asked the explanation representative four questions and his doubts were resolved. However, most of our captured personnel who wished to return home did not dare to apply for repatriation when listening to the explanation, as the "Interim Report" said: "It cannot be said that all those prisoners of war who did not seek repatriation did so freely and voluntarily, but rather due to some fear that had been instilled in their minds for a long time."

    In the face of these ironclad facts, isn't the US side's crime of instructing Li-Chiang secret agents to undermine the "Terms of Reference," depriving our captured personnel of the right to listen to explanations and apply for repatriation, in order to forcibly detain our captured personnel, thoroughly exposed?

    However, Hull—the United Nations Command Commander whose lies, as mentioned above, have been thoroughly exposed by facts—still shamelessly wrote to General Thimayya, blatantly denying the major responsibility of the US side for using Li-Chiang secret agents to undermine the explanation work, and even "categorically denied any assertion that we have in any way attempted to control the Nanying prisoners of war by sending secret agents to incite saboteurs—at a minimum—or that we have attempted to maintain any kind of intelligence network." Hull wants to use this rogue means of clinging to lies to cover up its adventurous steps of continuing to implement the destruction of the "Terms of Reference" and the robbery of our captured personnel.

    However, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, based on indisputable facts, believes that "the extension of the explanation period is legitimate and necessary" and that "submitting the future of the non-repatriated prisoners of war to a political conference is mandatory." At the same time, there is no doubt that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's "Interim Report" and other documents also show that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces should accept the proposals put forward in the reply letters from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai, resolutely continue to perform their unfinished legitimate duties, immediately resume explanation work, implement the segregation of prisoners of war, disrupt the secret agent violent organizations, eliminate all secret agents, and continue to take care of the prisoners of war after supplementing the ninety-day explanation period, pending the political conference's handling.

    事实是最雄辩的
    胡今
    美国方面一贯地进行漫天的撒谎和诡辩，企图掩盖其强迫扣留战俘的罪恶活动。但是，事实是最雄辩的，美方及其职业谎言家们是注定要在事实面前遭到彻底的破产的。
    中立国遣返委员会发表的“临时报告”，就提供了较系统的事实和论点，证实了朝中方面和我方归来人员所揭露的：美方及其布置的李蒋特务撕毁“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”，破坏解释工作，使中立国遣返委员会陷于瘫痪和我方被俘人员无法行使遣返权利的种种罪行。
    联合国军总司令赫尔在去年十二月二十三日片面宣布解释时间“期满”后，竟企图把中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队因美方特务的阻挠和破坏而使其无法执行职务的责任推到朝中方面身上，并假惺惺地“赞扬”一再遭到美方嘲弄的中立国遣返委员会和印度部队说：“他们坚持不渝地遵守了职权范围加诸于他们身上的规定。”但中立国遣返委员会的“临时报告”无异打了赫尔一记清脆的耳光，表明它是难于接受这个狐狸式的“赞扬”的。“临时报告”指出：由于美方指使东场里战俘营李蒋特务进行恐怖和破坏活动，“连本委员会本身也处于大韩民国之威胁与恐吓的统治之下，进一步增加了本委员会的困难”。结论中又说：“这些活动削弱了本委员会的看管和控制，并使其在任何时候建立战俘有选择的自由的工作异常困难。”
    事实是这样的：美国侵略者曾在两年多时间中，对在其直接拘留下的我方被俘人员，使用了种种血腥的迫害手段，并利用李蒋特务实行恐怖统治，以企图达到它强迫扣留战俘的目的。但停战协定签订后，根据这个协定，美方对我方被俘人员的控制和影响必须被解除，并把我方被俘人员移交中立国遣返委员会和印度部队看管；于是，它除了背信弃义地纵容李承晚集团在去年六月间非法“释放”了两万七千多我方被俘人员外，就竭力阻挠和破坏中立国遣返委员会的职权，使其无法按照“职权范围”和“工作细则”保障其看管下的两万二千 多我方被俘人员回家过和平生活的自由。
    “临时报告”列举了美方直接和间接地阻挠和破坏中立国遣返委员会工作的种种事实。
    美方蓄意迫使中立国遣返委员会陷于瘫痪状态的最毒辣的非法手段，就是把它在美方战俘营中一开始就建立了的控制和迫害我方被俘人员的李蒋特务组织，原封不动地移入东场里战俘营中，僭夺印度部队的控制权力和地位而成为实际的统治者，使东场里战俘营变为李蒋特务控制战俘的巢穴、我方被俘人员遭受迫害与屠杀的牢狱。
    我方一开始就向中立国遣返委员会提出要打乱美方布置移入东场里战俘营中的特务组织，并在军事停战委员会上向美方提出抗议，但美方首席委员拉西却一再厚颜无耻地断然否认这一事实，中立国遣返委员会的某些委员如瑞士、瑞典委员也歪曲日内瓦公约，帮腔说什么这个万恶的特务组织是能够容许的“战俘组织”。但无数的血腥事实证明：这个特务组织不仅是美方有计划地布置和打进去的，而且是直接奉行美方和李蒋匪帮的指示进行对战俘实行暴力统治的非法组织。“临时报告”说：“有战俘组织（即李蒋特务组织）总部的存在，并表明总部地点在汉城，受大韩民国宪兵总司令官的控制。这一总部与控制六个战俘围场的四个分支组织是相联系的。分支组织则控制着所有五十五个营场中的营场组织。在这三层组织之间有一个有效的通讯系统在工作，联合国军第六十四野战医院在这一通讯系统中构成了最重要的一环。”
    正是这个美方“医院”所直接指挥的李蒋特务组织，使我方被俘人员处在骇人听闻的血腥统治之下。我方被俘人员在营场中只要表露了回国愿望就会被毒打和杀害，他们听取解释、申请遣返的自由全被剥夺，“职权范围”和“工作细则”有关保障我方被俘人员这些权利的规定已被破坏无遗。“临时报告”说，我方被俘人员在营场中“均未享有寻求遣返的自由，并处于武力或武力威胁之下”；就是那些少数听到解释的战俘，也受到“来自战俘营组织与其领导的、并与战俘营组织与其领导有密切联系的武力或武力威胁”。
    “临时报告”完全揭穿了美方口口声声所谓尊重战俘“个人自由”、“自愿遣返”的可耻谎言。中立国遣返委员会在去年十月七日答复前联合国军总司令克拉克时就指出：“在营中没有一个战俘敢于公开要求遣返。他们必须秘密地如此作，或是冒着被其他战俘（即特务势力）打死或打伤的危险，或是冒着被武装警卫打死在铁丝网上的危险而要求遣返。战俘在表达愿望时所必须采取的这种不正常方式，使人们很自然地怀疑到全体战俘都不是自由的个人。”
    赫尔在其一九五三年十二月二十三日的声明中，竟含血喷人，反诬我方“破坏了对不遣返的战俘的解释”。然而，“临时报告”对中立国遣返委员会安排解释工作和过去解释工作进行情况的叙述，证明了阻挠破坏解释工作的，正是美方及其指使下的李蒋特务势力。
    美方曾以横蛮无理的态度辱骂中立国遣返委员会根据“职权范围”第八款及该款丁项规定拟订的“工作细则”，然后又指使李蒋特务破坏“工作细则”，使中立国遣返委员会无法顺利安排使我方得有自由与便利进行解释工作。根据“职权范围”的规定，应有九十天的解释时间，但我方解释工作因美方拖延修建解释营场而延迟了二十天才正式开始，然后美方又指使李蒋特务五次中断解释工作达六十天之久，我方实际解释工作仅进行了十天，每天都不足八小时，使两万二千多我方被俘人员只有不到百分之十五听到解释，尚有差不多两万人未能听到解释。
    “临时报告”对解释工作五次中断的原因的叙述，说明了解释工作第一次（十月十六日）和第二次（十月十八日至三十日）的中断，是由于李承晚特务阻止朝鲜人民军战俘出来听解释所致。第三次（十一月二日）的中断，也是由于美方特务反对我方进行广播解释所造成的。那时，中立国遣返委员会捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员曾正当地要求打乱特务组织，并在必要时使用武力带出战俘听取解释，而印度代表团也认为美方特务阻止战俘听解释“是非法的”，“为了克服这种反抗是可以使用武力的”。解释工作第四次（十一月六日至十五日）和第五次（十一月十七日至十二月二十日）的长期中断，则是由于美方特务反对隔离已听解释与未听解释的战俘，使我方解释工作无法进行。
    “临时报告”说明了李蒋特务破坏解释工作的狂妄活动，是完全遵照美方的意旨进行的。中立国遣返委员会“并注意到联合国军的意见与战俘‘代表’（即李蒋特务）所提意见相合，这些战俘‘代表’继续对进行解释表示敌意。”
    因此，在美方特务肆无忌惮地阻挠和破坏解释工作的情况下，我方被俘人员未经解释申请遣返的人数，比经解释后申请遣返的总数更多得多。这就是说，我方被俘人员不得不更多地冒着生命危险冲出死亡营申请遣返，其中有像归来人员王宪章那样被宣告死刑、挖好活埋他的土坑后爬出铁丝网；或像归来人员吕金良那样只能以假装看病申请遣返；或者就是由于印度部队对特务控制采取有效措施如调查二十八号营场张子龙惨案时许多战俘要求作证和要求遣返而获得自由。至于那些在听解释时申请遣返的我方被俘人员，也必须在解释帐篷内外美方特务的恐怖威胁之下冒死申请遣返，如归来人员岳黑旦不能不在解释帐篷中被吓呆了三小时才申请遣返；归来人员王山也是当他向解释代表提了四个问题得到解决而解除疑虑时才申请遣返。但是，大多数愿望回家的我方被俘人员在听解释时都不敢申请遣返，如“临时报告”所说：“不能说所有那些未寻求遣返的战俘是自由自愿地这样作，而非由于在他们头脑中长期灌输的某些恐惧所致。”
    在这铁一般的事实面前，美方指使李蒋特务破坏“职权范围”，剥夺我方被俘人员听取解释、申请遣返的权利，以便强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪行，不是彻头彻尾地暴露出来了吗？
    但是，赫尔——如上所述他的谎言已被事实彻底揭露的联合国军总司令，依然厚颜无耻地致函蒂迈雅将军，悍然否认美方利用李蒋特务破坏解释工作的重大罪责，甚至“断然否认关于我们曾在任何方面试图用派遣特务煽动分子的办法来对南营战俘加以——最低限度——控制的任何说法，或是我们曾试图维持任何种类情报网的说法”。赫尔想用这种死抓住谎言不放的无赖手段，来掩护其继续实行破坏“职权范围”、劫夺我方被俘人员的冒险步骤。
    然而，中立国遣返委员会根据不容辩驳的事实，认为“解释期限的延长是合法的和必要的”，“将未遣返战俘的前途问题提交政治会议，这是有强制性的”。同时，毫无疑问，中立国遣返委员会的“临时报告”等文件，也说明了中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队应该接受我方金日成元帅和彭德怀将军复函中所提出的主张，坚决继续履行其未完成的合法职务，立即恢复解释工作，实行隔离战俘，打散特务暴力组织，清除一切特务分子，并在补足九十天解释期限后继续看管战俘，以待政治会议的处理。
