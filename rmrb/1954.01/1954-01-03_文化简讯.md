    Achievements in Health and Medical Work in Honghe Region, Yunnan
    The health and medical work in the Honghe region of Yunnan Province has made great achievements, and the prevalence of various infectious diseases has been basically controlled.
    In the past, various infectious diseases were prevalent in Jinping, Yuanyang, and Honghe counties in the Honghe region. About 90% of the total population had suffered from malaria, and the incidence of various epidemic diseases such as dysentery was also very high. After liberation, county hospitals were established one after another, but because the area was vast, the villages were scattered, and transportation was extremely inconvenient, it often took people of all ethnic groups six or seven days to walk to the hospital for treatment, and at least half a day for the nearest ones. Based on this situation, the county hospitals frequently organized mobile medical teams to carry medicine packs, climb mountains and wade through rivers to go deep into villages and actively treat people of all ethnic groups. The mobile medical teams have set foot in every corner of the Honghe region. Their diligent treatment has basically brought the once extremely prevalent malaria under control, and dysentery and smallpox have also been basically eliminated, initially ensuring the health of people of all ethnic groups. According to incomplete statistics, the three county hospitals have treated a total of more than 195,000 people and vaccinated 210,000 people against smallpox and 18,000 people with preventive injections in over a year.

      云南红河地区卫生医疗工作有成绩
    云南省红河地区卫生医疗工作有很大成绩，现已基本上控制了各种传染病的流行。
    红河地区金平、元阳、红河三县过去流行各种传染病，患过疟疾的病人占总人口的百分之九十左右，痢疾等各种流行病的发病率也很大。解放以后，各县卫生院相继成立，但是因为地区辽阔，村落分散，交通又极为不便，各族人民到卫生院看一次病，往往要走六七天的路程，最近的也需步行半天。根据这个情况，各县卫生院便经常组织一些巡回医疗小组，背上药包，翻山涉水深入到各个村寨，主动为各族人民治疗疾病。巡回医疗小组的足迹踏遍了红河地区的每个角落，他们辛勤地进行治疗，使过去极为流行的疟疾基本上得到控制，痢疾和天花也已基本上消灭，初步保证了各族人民的健康。根据不完全统计，这三个县卫生院在一年多的时间内，共治疗了十九万五千多人次，为二十一万人种了牛痘，为一万八千人注射了防疫针。
