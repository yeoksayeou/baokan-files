Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The year 1953 was a year of victorious advancement for the working people of Czechoslovakia on the road of socialist construction.

　　In industry, the total output in 1953 had already increased to twice the highest level during the era of capitalist rule. The proportion of production materials in total industrial production increased from 56 percent in 1948 to 63 percent. The formerly backward Slovak region is rapidly industrializing. In 1953, Czechoslovakia's production of heavy machinery and equipment for industries such as metallurgy, electricity, and chemicals increased significantly.

　　Czechoslovakia's machine manufacturing industry learned from Soviet experience and manufactured domestically produced "Yustrovan" coal mining combines and combined machines for tunneling roadways. Steelworkers across the country are working according to Soviet technical standards. Due to the construction and expansion of many power stations, Czechoslovakia's power base has been further expanded. In the Slovak region alone, the Dobšiná, Orava, and Nové Mesto hydroelectric power stations have begun supplying electricity. At the construction site of the Vír hydroelectric power station, the reservoir has been filled with water. In terms of railway transportation, the construction of the "Friendship Railway" running from Čierna across Slovakia is proceeding victoriously. The 120-kilometer double-track railway connecting Brno and Havlíčkův Brod has been opened to traffic.

　　In agriculture, in 1953, the land cultivated by Czechoslovakia's unified agricultural cooperatives and state-owned farms accounted for 52 percent of the country's cultivated land area. Agricultural machinery has also increased significantly. As of October 1, 1953, there were 255 machine tractor stations across the country, with a total of 18,911 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 20,075 binding machines, 819 grain harvesting combines, and many other agricultural machines. Due to the further mechanization of agricultural work and improvements in land plowing, the yield per unit area of land has increased. Due to attention to the development of livestock breeding, the number of livestock in the country in 1953 increased by 10 percent compared to pre-war levels.

　　In the final year of the Five-Year Plan (1949-1953) – 1953, the industrial and agricultural working people of Czechoslovakia displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity. Departments such as heavy industry, light industry, and the food industry have successively completed the tasks of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. By December 23, the number of factories and mines across the country that had completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule had increased to more than 2,500. Unified agricultural cooperatives in various regions have also successively reported bumper harvests in grain, industrial raw material crops, and potatoes. The personal income of cooperative farmers has also increased.

    捷人民在五年计划最后一年获得新的成就
    全国有两千多个厂矿提前完成五年计划
    据新华社讯：一九五三年，是捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民在社会主义建设道路上胜利前进的一年。
    在工业方面，一九五三年的总生产量已提高为资本主义统治时代最高水平的两倍。生产资料的生产占全部工业生产的比重，已由一九四八年的百分之五十六提高到百分之六十三。原先落后的斯洛伐克地区正在迅速地工业化。一九五三年，捷克斯洛伐克的冶金、电力和化学等工业用的重型机器和装备的生产，都有很大增加。
    捷克斯洛伐克的机器制造业学习苏联的经验，制造了国产的“尤斯特罗万”采煤联合机和掘进巷道用的联合机。全国的炼钢工人都已按照苏联的技术标准进行工作。由于新建和扩建了许多电力站，捷克斯洛伐克的动力基地更加扩大了。单是斯洛伐克地区，开始供电的就有道勃兴、奥拉瓦和诺伏麦斯特等水电站。在维拉水电站的建筑工地上，水库已蓄满了水。在铁路运输方面，由契尔纳起贯穿斯洛伐克全境的“友谊铁路”的建筑工程，正在胜利地进行施工。联接布尔诺和加弗里契科夫的布罗特的一百二十公里长的双轨铁路，已经通车。
    在农业方面，一九五三年捷克斯洛伐克的统一农业合作社和国营农场所耕种的土地，已占全国耕地面积百分之五十二。农业机器也有很大增加。到一九五三年十月一日为止，全国已有二百五十五个机器拖拉机站，共拥有一万八千九百一十一部拖拉机（每部以十五匹马力计算），二万零七十五部捆禾机，八百一十九部谷物收割联合机和其他许多农业机器。由于农业工作的进一步机械化和土地翻耕工作的改进，土地的单位面积产量已经提高。由于注意发展牲畜饲养工作，一九五三年全国牲畜头数已比战前增加了百分之十。
    捷克斯洛伐克工农业劳动人民在五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）的最后一年——一九五三年中，发挥了高度的劳动热情和创造能力。重工业、轻工业、食品工业等部门纷纷提前完成五年计划的任务。到十二月二十三日为止，全国提前完成五年计划的厂矿数目已增加到两千五百多个。各地统一农业合作社也陆续传来在谷物、工业原料作物和马铃薯方面获得丰收的消息。合作社农民的个人收入也增加了。
