    Physics Class Frequently "Self-Study" and Large Classes
    A letter from Zhu Sibao, a student at the Affiliated Workers' and Peasants' Quick Training School of Nanjing University: We are studying science and engineering, and physics is our most important course. However, since the last semester, our school has been lacking physics teachers, and physics classes are often changed to "self-study" or large classes. After the start of last semester, our physics class was "free self-study" for a month. Later, the school invited a teaching assistant from Nanjing University to temporarily take over. The substitute teacher did not know our teaching plan and lacked time to prepare lessons, so the lectures were difficult to understand and the progress was very slow. According to the regulations, we should have completed the first book of junior high school physics last semester, but we only learned less than half of the book.
    At the beginning of this semester, the students were full of confidence that the physics teacher problem would definitely be solved. But at the beginning of the semester, physics class was again "free self-study" for four weeks. Later, a teacher who had just graduated from school came, but became ill after only teaching four lessons, and physics class was again changed to "self-study". After students raised their opinions, the school decided to use the method of large classes to solve the problem, with one teacher teaching nine classes, which affected the teaching effect. Recently, although a new teacher has arrived, they did not originally study physics, so the general students do not understand the lectures.
    Our students in science and engineering classes will enter university science or engineering programs in the future, and now we must lay a good foundation in physics. If we study like this, how can we meet the requirements of the motherland in training us?

### 物理课经常“自习”和上大课

专栏：读者来信摘要

    物理课经常“自习”和上大课
    南京大学附设工农速成中学学生朱嗣保来信：我们是学理工科的，物理是我们最主要的课程。但是，我校从上学期以来一直缺乏物理教师，物理课经常改为“自习”或上大课。上学期开学后，我们的物理课就“自由自习”了一个月。后来校方请了南京大学一位助教来暂代。代课老师既不知道我们教学计划，也缺乏时间备课，所以讲的既不好懂，进度又很慢。按照规定上学期应学完初中物理第一册，可是我们才学了不到全册的二分之一。
    本学期开始时，同学都满怀信心地认为这学期的物理教师问题一定能够解决了。可是一开学，物理课又“自由自习”了四个星期。后来来了一位刚从学校毕业的教师，但只上了四节课就生病了，物理课就又改为“自习”。经同学提意见后，校方就决定用上大课的办法解决，九个班由一个老师教，就影响了教学效果。最近虽然新来了一位老师，但是原来不是学物理的，所以讲课时一般同学都听不懂。
    我们理工班的学生将来要升入大学理科或工科，现在必须打下很好的物理基础。如果像我们这样学下去，怎样能达到祖国培养我们的要求呢？
