Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 31st: The Minister of Heavy Industry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Doo-sam, in an interview with a TASS reporter, spoke about the achievements of the economic recovery work in Korea over the past five months. He said: The Korean working people are making every effort to rebuild old factories and build new ones as quickly as possible. In the next few years, we must not only re-establish everything we had before the war, but also build many new factories equipped with the latest equipment.

    In fact, the past five months of peace have only been a preparatory stage for the large-scale reconstruction work that will begin next year. We have thoroughly investigated the damage caused by the war, drawn up construction plans, cleared the rubble from construction sites, and begun to repair damaged factories. In addition, all factories under the Heavy Industry Ministry have been completely repaired and put into operation. For example, on the 55th day after the armistice, one of our steel factories had already produced its first batch of products since the war. The country's coal production has doubled compared to the pre-war period, and the production of various mineral ores is also constantly increasing. We pay special attention to the mechanization of mining operations and the exploration of new mineral deposits. While rebuilding the most important iron and steel industry enterprises, the Republic will build many mechanical factories, including Korea's first automobile factory, which will be put into production in 1957. The construction of a machine-building factory is progressing smoothly, and this factory will begin producing machine tools for metal processing next year.

    The tremendous assistance provided by the Soviet Union, People's China, and the various People's Democratic countries is extremely important for the rapid recovery of Korea's national economy. Many factories in Korea have already received machine tools, various equipment, and blueprints from the above-mentioned countries.

    Workers, engineers, and technicians of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are unremittingly mastering advanced Soviet operating methods and greatly improving labor productivity.

    Kim Doo-sam concluded by saying: The American aggressors have caused enormous damage to our motherland. It will take a considerable amount of time and great effort to rebuild our war-torn national economy, but the Korean people believe that under the leadership of their government and with the help of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various People's Democratic countries, they will victoriously complete their great task.

    朝鲜重工业相谈五个月来经济恢复工作的成就
    朝鲜人民正尽最大力量重建工业
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社平壤三十日讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国重工业相金斗三在接见塔斯社记者时，谈到了朝鲜经济复兴工作五个月来的成就。他说：朝鲜劳动人民正尽最大力量和最迅速地重建旧的、并建设新的工厂。在今后几年中，我们不仅一定要重新建立起我们在战前所有的一切东西，而且要建设许多装备有最新式的设备的新工厂。
    事实上，在过去五个月的和平日子里，只不过是明年要开始的大规模复兴工作的准备阶段而已。我们已详尽地调查了战争造成的损害，拟订了建设计划，清除了建筑工地上的废墟，并开始修复遭受破坏的工厂。除此以外，重工业省所属全部工厂已经完全修复并已开工。譬如在停战以后的第五十五天，我们的一个钢铁工厂已经生产了战后的第一批产品。全国的煤产量已为战前时期的两倍，各种矿砂的产量也在不断增加。我们特别注意采矿工作的机械化以及探勘新的矿藏。在重建最重要的钢铁工业企业的同时，共和国将建设许多机械工厂，其中包括朝鲜第一座汽车厂，这座工厂将在一九五七年投入生产。一座机器制造工厂的建设工作进行得很顺利，这座工厂将在明年开始生产用于金属加工的工作母机。
    苏联、人民中国以及各人民民主国家所给予的巨大援助，对于最迅速地恢复朝鲜的国民经济是极为重要的。朝鲜许多工厂已经从上述国家收到工作母机、各种设备与蓝图。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的工人、工程师和技术人员正在百折不挠地掌握先进的苏联操作法，并大大地提高了劳动生产率。
    金斗三最后说：美国侵略者使我们的祖国遭到了巨大的破坏。要重建我们的饱受战争创伤的国民经济，是需要相当长的时间与巨大努力的，但是朝鲜人民相信在他们政府的领导下，在苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家的帮助下，他们将胜利地完成他们的伟大任务。
