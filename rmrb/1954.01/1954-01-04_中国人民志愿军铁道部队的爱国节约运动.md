Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps' Patriotic Economy Drive
Ai Liquan

From the years when the war was still raging to the days after the armistice when helping the Korean people restore construction, all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps have been working tirelessly to save and create wealth for the motherland, collect waste materials, and make equipment themselves. Their slogan is: "Stand at the forefront of saving for the motherland!"

I visited a battalion of the Railway Corps. During the war, in order to respond to the motherland's call for increased production and economy with practical actions, this battalion focused on a certain Jiang Bridge, organizing the entire battalion to salvage and collect engineering materials and tools abandoned in the river and scattered in various places. At that time, all the commanders and fighters braved the rampant attacks of enemy aircraft, broke through the ice in the rivers, overcame all difficulties, and in just over ten days, salvaged and collected railway equipment worth 2.4 billion yuan. This not only saved and created huge wealth for the motherland, but also solved the difficulty of material shortages in the emergency repair project. Therefore, this battalion was honorably commended by the leading organs of the Railway Corps. I and Lei, the technician of this battalion, inspected this batch of equipment. We passed through several mountain caves in succession, and it took about two hours to see them all. Technician Lei said excitedly to me:

	"Korea is truly a living transportation university! If I had not personally participated in this battle, I really couldn't have imagined that under the continuous and crazy attacks of enemy aircraft, in the frozen river water, and under the severe lack of lifting tools, just relying on our hands and brains, we would be able to salvage these materials weighing several tons or even dozens of tons." Then, he said meaningfully: "If there is no deep understanding of the noble qualities of our troops and soldiers in loving the motherland, these miracles will be considered unbelievable!"

Indeed, these equipment were collected and salvaged by the commanders and fighters with the spirit of risking their lives. I visited a deputy squad leader of this unit—Communist Party member Song Changlin. He is a chubby young man who looks a bit childish. When the battle was tense, a damaged steel beam was hanging diagonally on a dilapidated bridge pier in a certain place. In order to remove this beam, he climbed up the bridge pier more than ten meters high along the overhanging single rail on the Jiang Bridge, holding a crowbar, and used all his strength to move the steel beam. The bridge pier trembled dangerously, and large chunks of cement under Song Changlin's feet fell down, smashing the thick ice on the river surface and splashing water several feet high. He stood on this dangerous bridge pier and worked for forty-five minutes before removing the steel beam.

I asked him what power supported him? He replied:

	"The more beams we salvage, the more money we can save for the motherland. A sleeper costs over 100,000 yuan, how much is a military beam transported from the motherland worth! In order to save for the motherland, in order to save materials to accelerate the construction of the motherland, even if we sacrifice ourselves, this life will not be in vain!" Thousands upon thousands of heroes are fighting on the railway lines of Korea with this lofty patriotic spirit.

If the equipment collected by the soldiers is not processed, most of it will be waste. However, the soldiers use their wisdom and hands to convert or repair them into various materials needed on site. In the Volunteer Army Railway Corps, almost every company has one to several battlefield "iron factories." They are distributed in the mountain valleys and mine caves along the railway line, working day and night to save and create wealth for the motherland. These "iron factories" were almost all started from scratch. I specially visited one of them.

Sitting on a sunny hillside, old foreman Qiao Peijin and deputy squad leader Liu Baoting told me about the process of establishing their "iron factory." Before the "May 1st" Labor Day in 1952, in order to save equipment transported from the motherland and overcome the difficulties in repairing a certain Jiang Bridge, the battalion headquarters decided to establish an ironworking squad. The two of them accepted this task. They went to great lengths to find a blacksmith's furnace in a Korean farmer's house. They lived there and helped the Korean old man in the blacksmith's furnace. After finishing the old man's work every day, they took the time to build a set of tools for the blacksmith's furnace. After working for more than ten days, they made four fire tongs, a hand hammer, a flat hammer, an anvil, and bought an anvil with the consolation money that they had saved from the people of the motherland. Before leaving, the Korean old man bid them farewell with tears in his eyes, and insisted on giving them a furnace. In this way, their "iron factory" started work on "May 1st" Labor Day in 1952. Up to now, they have expanded to have three blacksmith furnaces, trained thirteen ironworkers, and manufactured and repaired tens of thousands of pieces of equipment.

Walking into their factory—actually a farmer's cowshed—the shed was filled with smoke, and three furnaces were burning fiercely. Holding tongs, hammering, pulling bellows, adding fuel, a group of people were working vigorously. On the windshield of the furnace, their economy plan and slogans were written in colored chalk.

I visited a storage room they built very exquisitely. There, some of the tools they manufactured and repaired were neatly piled up. Rows of sledgehammers, flat hammers, crowbars, pickaxes, splints, as well as spikes, hack saws, track spikes... On the larger equipment, the name of the manufacturer is left, which is to facilitate checking each person's finished product and studying how to improve the quality.

Around the house, there were piles of steel they had collected. Among them were parts from enemy tanks and cars that had been destroyed, various bomb casings, steel rail heads, scrap steel bars, etc. This is the raw material for manufacturing railway equipment. Qiao Peijin told me: The scrap iron on the tanks can be used to make pickaxes and shovels; the scrap steel bars can be used to make spikes and hacksaws; the bomb casings can be used to make planer blades and kitchen knives; the waste oil tanks can be used to make blacksmith furnaces, saw blades, rice pots, and water tanks... It is with these materials that they manufactured 30 kinds of equipment urgently needed on site, totaling 27,769 pieces, in six months.

The good news of the motherland's economic construction greatly encouraged them. Recently, the ironworking squad led by Qiao Peijin has formulated a half-year patriotic increase in production and economy plan, and challenged all brother ironworking squads in the whole regiment to launch a revolutionary heroism competition. In the first month of implementing the plan, they repaired and manufactured 3,003 pieces of equipment; the output in the second month increased sharply, repairing 15 kinds of equipment totaling 4,310 pieces, and increasing the production of 8 kinds of equipment totaling 2,338 pieces. They said with confidence: In order to support the construction of Korea, in order to save materials and accelerate the industrialization of the motherland, they must create greater achievements in the next four months.

When the war was going on, the enemy had vainly attempted to destroy our railway transportation with time bombs. But the enemy never dreamed that the heroes of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps not only defeated this trick of the enemy, but also turned the explosives of the time bombs into the wealth of the people. Guo Jinsheng, a special-class meritorious hero of a certain unit, disassembled 659 time bombs and cluster bombs dropped by the enemy, and the explosives he took out alone were worth 165 million yuan. I visited Li Yunlong, a Communist Party member and expert in disassembling time bombs in a certain company. This young hero, who blushes when he sees strangers, once extracted 7,000 kilograms of explosives from dozens of enemy time bombs in one month. The company used these explosives to excavate 930 cubic meters of ballast, improved the roadbed of the entire company's jurisdiction, and greatly increased the speed of driving.

Li Yunlong constantly studies and improves his skills, and imparts his skills to his comrades. Once, while studying the detonator structure of the enemy's time bombs, an explosion was triggered, injuring his right eye and upper lip, but he did not cry out in pain, but excitedly shouted: "This time I found the trick! This time I found experience for everyone!" He immediately attended the squad meeting to check the implementation of the patriotic economy plan with injuries.

In front of these heroes who are infinitely loyal to the motherland and possess extraordinary courage and wisdom, the enemy's time bombs are powerless.

In the Volunteer Army Railway Corps' victory over enemy bombing and in the patriotic economy drive, the heroic deeds of the commanders of various units who struggled hard are unforgettable. I spent a few days with Regiment Commander Li Wanhua, who was awarded the Second Class Merit. He is a revolutionary fighter from a peasant family in northern Sichuan with rich war experience. In the long revolutionary war, his body was weakened due to several injuries. When I visited, he was running a high fever and convulsing painfully, but he still went back and forth on the scene and in the company every day, leading the entire regiment to carry out the restoration and reconstruction project of a certain railway line, and launching a patriotic economy campaign to collect waste materials and make equipment themselves. The technical personnel and commanders and fighters in the regiment all said that Comrade Li Wanhua is not only an amiable and respectable commander, but also an engineer who is proficient in railway technology. He himself once put forward a rationalization proposal, which saved 28,000 man-days in transporting more than 14,000 cubic meters of stone. Under his leadership and support, the entire regiment deeply launched the rationalization proposal movement. In one year, the entire regiment put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals. Among them, the "exploration shovel" created by Liu Min, the company commander of a certain company, can detect cracks in the track in the dark; the "re-railer" jointly created by the commanders and fighters of a certain company can pull the derailed cars back to the track; and they also created a new method of filling bomb craters, which can reduce the construction time by two-thirds.

During the war, when Li Wanhua led the entire regiment to fight against the enemy's key bombing at a railway pass, the enemy dropped as many bombs in two months as there were sleepers, destroying 2,000 steel rails, but they collected and repaired 2,071 steel rails. Thoroughly defeated the enemy's so-called "strangulation warfare."

Recently, in order to concentrate the wisdom of the entire regiment, his regiment held a technical research and finished product exhibition of self-made equipment of each company. After watching the exhibition, he said excitedly to me: "We used American materials to solve our own problems. The company is really famous! Just talking about today's affairs: I watched the exhibition of each company in order, and there were hundreds of pieces of equipment in each place. In terms of quality and quantity, it is like the products of a fully equipped factory. The patriotic economy drive not only solved many problems in emergency repairs and key projects, but also saved a lot of materials for the motherland. We must not only add some bricks and tiles to the motherland's economic construction, but also add some cement and steel bars!"

With the joint efforts of the commanders and fighters, many units have listed "detailed accounting" and increased production and economy as regular systems. Many classes have set up "saving registration books" and "detailed ledger accounts," and summarize the achievements of the day's savings every day. I saw the following verses in a "ledger":

	"A track spike is two catties of grain, increase production and economy to support the front, rush to repair the railway to seize time, every minute and every second must be ahead!"

It is with this spirit that the commanders and fighters, in collaboration with the Korean railway workers, defeated the destructive tricks of the American aerial bandits. Despite the increasing enemy bombing of the railway line, the efficiency of our railway transportation in 1952 was more than five times higher than in 1951.

While defeating the enemy, the Volunteer Army Railway Corps also achieved brilliant results in saving work. According to a rough estimate, from the first day of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps' arrival in Korea in the winter of 1950 to the end of June 1953, they collected, salvaged, and self-made materials and tools worth 265.6 billion yuan in total. If this batch of equipment were to be transported by rail, it would require 6,780 railcars, which could be arranged for 75 kilometers.

After the Korean armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps immediately participated in the restoration and construction of the Korean railway with great labor enthusiasm. They also more actively launched a patriotic economy drive to collect abandoned materials and make equipment themselves, and proposed to "tailor clothes according to the existing material resources," "use local materials," and "make the best use of everything" in the project. In this movement, only in the completion of the first phase of the restoration and improvement project of the Korean railway, they saved and created wealth worth more than 100 billion yuan. The heroic "Yang Liandi Company" collected and converted more than 5,000 pieces of materials such as steel rails, hacksaws, square-headed needles, and fishplates in October of last year alone, worth more than 167.7 million yuan.

The heroes who continue to fight on the Korean railway line are using this spirit of hard struggle to complete the arduous task entrusted to them by the people of the motherland to help the Korean people rebuild a peaceful life.

    中国人民志愿军铁道部队的爱国节约运动
    艾立泉
    从战争还在激烈地进行着的年月到停战以后帮助朝鲜人民恢复建设的日子，中国人民志愿军铁道部队的全体指战员们一直在努力不懈地进行着为祖国节约和创造财富、搜集废材弃材、自制器材的运动。他们的口号是：“站在为祖国节约的最前列”！
    我访问了铁道部队的一个营。这个营在战争期间为了以实际行动响应祖国的增产节约的号召，曾以某江桥为重点，组织全营打捞和搜集废弃在江中与散布各地的工程材料和工具。全营指战员当时冒着敌机的猖狂侵袭，冲破江河中的冰凌，排除万难，在短短的十多天当中，打捞和搜集了价值二十四亿元的铁路器材。这不仅为祖国节约和创造了巨额的财富，并且解决了抢修工程中材料缺乏的困难。因此这个营曾光荣地受到铁道部队领导机关的通令嘉奖。我和这个营的雷技术员巡视了这批器材。我们接连穿过几个山洞，走了约两个钟头才看完它们。雷技术员激动地对我说：
      “朝鲜真是一座活的交通大学！假如我没有亲身参加这次战斗，真不敢想像在敌机不间断的疯狂袭击下，在冰封的江水中，在严重地缺乏起重工具的条件下，只凭双手和脑子会能把这些数吨以至数十吨重的物资打捞上来。”接着，他又意味深长地说：“假如对我们的部队和战士热爱祖国的高贵品质没有深切的了解，对这些奇迹就会认为是不可思议的！”
    的确，这些器材是指战员们以出生入死的精神搜集和打捞起来的。我访问了这个部队的一位副班长——共产党员宋长林。他是一个胖胖的、看去还有些孩子气的青年人。在战斗紧张地进行的时候，某地一个残缺的桥墩上斜挂着一片被炸坏了的钢梁。为了取下这片梁，他沿着江桥上倒垂下来的单轨，爬上了十多公尺高的桥墩，拿着撬棍，使用全身气力去拨动钢梁。桥墩危险地颤动着，宋长林脚下的洋灰大块大块地往下掉，砸开江面的厚冰，溅起几尺高的水花。他站在这个危险的桥墩上工作了四十五分钟，才把钢梁拨下来。
    我问他是什么力量支持着他呢？他回答说：
    “我们多打捞一片梁，就可以为祖国节省一大笔钱。一个枕木就要上十万块钱，一片从祖国运来的军用梁值多少钱啊！为了给祖国节约，为了省下器材加速祖国建设，就是牺牲了自己，这辈子也不算白活了！”成千成万的英雄们就是抱着这种崇高的爱国精神在朝鲜的铁道线上战斗着。
    战士们搜集来的器材，如果不经过加工，那大部分都是废料。可是，战士们就凭他们的智慧和双手，就地把它们改制或修理成各种现场需用的材料。在志愿军铁道部队里，几乎每个连队都有一个至数个战地“铁工厂”。它们分布在铁路沿线的山沟里、矿洞里，日夜不停地在为祖国节约和创造财富。这些“铁工厂”几乎全都是白手起家的。我特地访问了其中的一个。
    坐在一个向阳的山坡上，老工长乔培金和副班长刘宝廷对我讲述他们成立“铁工厂”的经过。一九五二年“五一”节前，营部为了节省祖国运来的器材，并克服抢修某号江桥的困难，决定成立一个铁工班。他们俩就接受了这个任务，他们费了很大的周折，才找到了一家朝鲜农家的铁匠炉。他们就住在那儿帮助铁匠炉的朝鲜老汉干活。每天把老汉的活做完之后，再抽时间打造一副铁匠炉的工具。工作了十多天之后，他们打好了四把火钳、一把手锤、一把平锤、一个垛子，并且用他们自己省下来的祖国人民送给他们的慰问金买了一个砧子。临别时，朝鲜老汉含着眼泪送别他们，并无论如何要送他们一盘炉。就这样，他们的“铁工厂”在一九五二年“五一”节开工了。到现在，他们已经扩大到有了三副铁匠炉，培养了十三个铁工，制造和修理了数万件器材。
    走进他们的工厂——其实是一个农家的牛棚，棚里烟雾弥漫，三个炉子燃着熊熊烈火。掌钳的、打锤的、拉风箱的、烧火加料的，一群人在生龙活虎地工作着。炉子的挡风板上，用彩色粉笔写着他们的节约计划和口号。
    我参观了他们一间建筑得很精巧的储藏室。那儿整齐地堆放着一部分他们制造和修理好了的工具。一排排的大锤、平锤、撬棍、洋镐、夹板，还有穿心钉、扒锯、道钉……在大件的器材上，都留有制造人的姓名，这是为了便于检查每个人的成品，研究提高质量。
    在房子周围，堆积着他们搜集来的钢铁。其中有击毁了的敌人坦克、汽车上的零件，各种炸弹皮、钢轨头、废钢筋等等。这就是他们制造铁路器材的原料。乔培金告诉我：坦克上的废铁，可以打洋镐、铁锹；废钢筋做穿心钉、扒锯；炸弹皮做刨刃、菜刀；废油箱盘铁匠炉、做锯条、饭锅、水缸……。就是用这些材料，他们在六个月当中，制造了现场急需的器材三十种计二万七千七百六十九件。
    祖国经济建设的喜讯极大地鼓舞了他们。最近乔培金领导的铁工班订出了为期半年的爱国增产节约计划，并向全团各兄弟铁工班挑战，展开革命英雄主义的竞赛。在执行计划的头一个月中，他们修理和制造了器材三千零三件；第二个月的产量急遽上升，修理器材十五种计四千三百一十件，增产器材八种计二千三百三十八件。他们满怀信心地说：为了支援朝鲜的建设，为了节省物资加速祖国的工业化，要在今后四个月中创造更大的成绩。
    在战争进行的时候，敌人曾妄想用定时炸弹来破坏我们的铁路运输。可是敌人做梦也想不到，志愿军铁道部队的英雄们不仅战胜了敌人这种诡计，而且把定时炸弹的炸药变成了人民的财富。某部特等功臣郭金升，先后拆卸了六百五十九颗敌人投下的定时弹和子母弹，单只他所取出的炸药，就值一亿六千五百万元。我访问了某连的拆卸定时炸弹的能手、共产党员李云龙。这个见了生人要脸红的青年英雄，曾在一个月中从数十颗敌人的定时炸弹里掏出七千公斤炸药。连队用这些炸药开采了九百三十方石碴，改善了全连辖区的路基，大大提高了行车速度。
    李云龙不断地研究提高技术，并把他的技术传授给战友们。有一次在研究敌人的定时弹的雷管构造时，曾引起爆炸，打伤了他的右眼和上唇，可是他没有叫痛，而是兴奋地高呼：“这回可找到窍门了！这回给大家找到经验了！”他立即带伤出席了检查爱国节约计划执行情况的班务会议。
    在这些对祖国无限忠诚而又具有超人的勇敢与智慧的英雄们的面前，敌人的定时炸弹无能为力了。
    在志愿军铁道部队战胜敌人的轰炸、进行爱国节约运动中，各部队的指挥员们艰苦斗争的英雄事迹是令人不能忘怀的。我和荣立二等功的李万华团长相处了几天。他是四川北部农民出身有着丰富战争经历的革命战士。在长期的革命战争中，他的身体因数次负伤而衰弱了。我访问时，他正在发高烧，全身痛苦地痉挛着，可是他还是每天在现场和连队里转来转出，领导全团进行着某铁路线的恢复、重建工程，并且开展着搜集废材弃材，自制器材的爱国节约运动。团里的技术人员和指战员们都说，李万华同志不仅是一个可亲可敬的指挥员，而且是一个精通铁道技术的工程师。他自己曾提出一项合理化建议，在运一万四千多方石头中，节省了两万八千个工。在他的领导和支持下，全团深入地开展了合理化建议运动。一年中全团提出的合理化建议有一百多件。其中有某连连长刘敏创造的“探险铲”，可以在黑夜探出轨道的裂纹；有某连指战员共同创造的“复轨器”，可以把脱线的车皮拉到轨道上来；还有他们创造的一项新的填平弹坑的办法，可以减少施工时间三分之二。
    在战争期间，李万华领导全团在一个铁路要隘上和敌人的重点轰炸作斗争时，敌人在两个月中投下的炸弹有枕木数目那末多，炸毁了两千根钢轨，可是他们却搜集和修理了钢轨两千零七十一根。彻底打败了敌人的所谓“绞杀战”。
    最近，为了集中全团的智慧，他的团里举行了各连自制器材的技术研究和成品展览会。在看了展览会后，他兴奋地对我说：“我们使用美国人的材料，解决了自己的问题。连队也真有名堂！只就今天的事情来说吧：我挨着次序看了各连的展览会，每一处都有数以百计的器材。论质量，论数量，就像设备齐全的工厂出产的一样。爱国节约运动不光解决了抢修和重点工程中的许多问题，而且给祖国节约了大量的物资。我们不仅要为祖国的经济建设增加一些砖瓦，还要增加一些水泥钢筋哩！”
    在指战员的共同努力下，许多部队都把“算细账”、增产节约列为经常制度。许多班里都设置了“节约登记簿”、“细账流水账”，每天总结一天节约的成绩。我看到的一个“账簿”上提着下列的诗句：
    “一颗道钉二斤粮，增产节约支前方，抢修铁道争时间，一分一秒要提前！”
    指战员们就是以这种精神，协同朝鲜铁道职工，打败了美国空中强盗的破坏诡计。尽管敌人对铁路线的轰炸日益增加，但一九五二年我方的铁道运输效率，比一九五一年提高了五倍以上。
    在战胜敌人的同时，志愿军铁道部队的节约工作也获得了辉煌的成绩。据概略的估计，自一九五○年冬志愿军铁道部队到朝鲜的第一天起，到一九五三年六月底止，他们共搜集、打捞和自制的材料工具，价值达两千六百五十六亿元。这批器材如果要用铁道运送，需要六千七百八十个车皮，可排列七十五公里长。
    朝鲜停战以后，中国人民志愿军铁道部队立即以极大的劳动热情参加了朝鲜铁路的恢复和建设工作。他们并更积极地开展了搜集弃材废材、自制器材的爱国节约运动，并提出要在工程中根据现有物力做到“量体裁衣”、“就地取材”、“物尽其用”。在这个运动中，仅在完成朝鲜铁路的第一期的复旧和改善工程中，又节约和创造了价值一千多亿元的财富。英雄的“杨连第连”，仅在去年十月一个月内，就搜集与改制了钢轨、扒锯、方头针、鱼尾板等材料五千多件，价值一亿六千七百多万元。
    在朝鲜铁道线上继续战斗着的英雄们，就是以这种艰苦奋斗的精神来完成祖国人民付托给他们的援助朝鲜人民重建和平生活的艰巨任务的。
