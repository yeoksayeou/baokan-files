    The Yantai Zhiluo Automobile Transportation Company, since its joint public-private ownership in 1951, has seen significant business development. There were originally seventeen private automobile transportation companies in Yantai. In 1950, to avoid blind competition among themselves, they voluntarily formed a private joint automobile transportation company, unifying freight rates and unified cargo procurement. However, because each car dealer competed to transport goods on good roads, and no one wanted to go on bad roads, the company failed to complete its transportation tasks. In addition, some car dealers had deeply ingrained bad habits, such as not paying workers when income was low and squandering money at will when income was high, resulting in increasingly worn-out vehicles. Before the joint ownership, 50% of the tires were unusable, and four vehicles were out of service, greatly weakening transportation capacity.
    In the winter of 1950, state-owned transportation companies issued a call for joint public-private ownership. At that time, many car dealers did not understand the significance of joint ownership, fearing that they would not be able to make their own decisions after the joint ownership, that spending money would be inconvenient, and that they would lose their jobs in old age. Therefore, the joint ownership did not materialize. Later, after a long period of deliberation and careful accounting, the car dealers' thinking gradually cleared up, and they formally entered into joint ownership in July 1951. After the joint ownership, organizational rules were drafted, a shareholders' meeting was established, and a valuation committee of seventeen people was elected by both public and private parties to assess vehicle prices. Directors and supervisors were elected to form a board of directors. The original car dealers, drivers, assistants, repair workers, and personnel of the private joint transportation company were all assigned specific work tasks according to their abilities.
    After the joint ownership, under the leadership of the state-owned transportation company, the company established sound work systems, financial systems, and various responsibility systems, and implemented planned management and incentive methods. Cargo was uniformly allocated by the state-owned transportation company, and all work was put on the right track. Later, through the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, safe production, and the increase production and practice economy movement, the workers' awareness improved, and their enthusiasm for production was very high, and business income increased year by year. If the income of the first half of 1951 before the joint ownership is taken as 100, it increased to 113 in the second half of the year, rose to 177 in 1952, and increased to 260.7 from January to September 1953. With the development of business, profits also increased year by year. At the end of 1952, after setting aside 20% of the public reserve fund, shareholders received a dividend of 5%. It is estimated that the profit in 1953 will be twice that of the previous year. The lives of workers have also improved day by day, wages have increased, safety and health work and welfare work have improved, and those with good work performance can also receive rewards.
    The development of business after joint ownership has proved the superiority of state capitalism. Private shareholders have confidence in the joint venture, and they say: "We are fortunate to have entered into joint ownership. We can learn and receive dividends, which is much better than individual management!" After the capitalists' confidence in management improved, the company used the public reserve fund from the profits to add new offices, and also purchased some new cars, lathes, and drilling machines. All vehicles have gradually been replaced with good tires. The company is preparing to expand its business to adapt to large-scale economic construction.

    公私合营烟台芝罗汽车运输公司业务发展
    烟台芝罗汽车运输公司，自一九五一年公私合营后，业务大为发展。烟台原有私营汽车运输公司十七户，一九五零年他们为避免同业之间的盲目竞争，自发的组成民营汽车联运公司，统一运价并统一承揽货源。但因各车商争着承运好路上的东西，坏路派谁谁不去，结果公司完不成运输任务；再加上一些车商恶习很深，收入少时不给工人工资，收入多时随意挥霍，车辆越跑越破，到合营前有百分之五十的轮胎不能用，有四部车停驶，运输力大大削弱。
    一九五零年冬国营运输公司提出公私合营的号召，当时许多车商对合营的意义还不了解，怕合营后自己不能作主，花钱不方便，怕年老失业，因此合营没有组成。后来又经过长时期的酝酿和算细账，车商思想逐渐通了，于一九五一年七月正式合营。合营后拟订组织章程，成立股东会，由公私双方选出十七人组成评估委员会评估车价，选举董事及监察人，组成董事会。原有的车商、司机、助手、修理工及民营联运公司人员，按他们的能力，都分配给一定的工作任务。
    合营后，公司在国营运输公司的领导下建立了健全的工作制度、财务制度和各种责任制度，并实行计划管理和奖励办法，货源统一由国营运输公司分配，各项工作走上正轨。以后又经过三反、安全生产、增产节约等运动，职工觉悟程度提高，生产情绪很高，营业收入逐年增加。如果以一九五一年上半年合营前的收入为一百，下半年即增为一一三弱，一九五二年上升为一七七，一九五三年一至九月增加到二六零点七。随着业务的发展，利润也逐年增加。一九五二年年底，除提出百分之二十的公积金外，股东们都分到百分之五的股息。一九五三年的利润估计将达前一年的两倍。职工的生活也日益改善，工资提高了，安全卫生工作和福利工作改进了，工作成绩好的，还可以得到奖励。
    合营后业务的发展，证明了国家资本主义的优越性，私股股东对合营事业有了信心，他们说：“我们幸亏合营了，又能学习，又分到利息，比个人经营不知好多少倍！”资本家经营信心提高后，公司用从盈利中提出的公积金添盖了新办公室，还增购了一些汽车、车床、钻床，所有的车辆都逐渐换上了好轮胎，公司正准备扩大经营业务，以适应大规模的经济建设。
