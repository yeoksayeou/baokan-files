    The election work for the People's Congress in the Northeast Military Region and the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been successfully completed.
    The election in all departments, units, and schools of the Northeast Military Region has concluded. Currently, the units have elected over a hundred representatives to attend the Northeast Military Region's Servicemen's Representative Assembly and over ninety representatives to attend the People's Congresses of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Longjiang, Rehe, Changchun, Andong, Jinzhou, Qiqihar, Chengde and other provinces and cities. The military region's units fully promoted democracy and carefully proposed lists of candidates, electing outstanding commanders, soldiers, and famous combat heroes from the military region's forces as representatives of the People's Liberation Army. Among the elected representatives are combat heroes Zhao Xingyuan, Ma Chunyu, and Li Qiyuan, who attended the National Combat Heroes Representative Conference; Qi Shengyong, the political commissar of a certain regiment and a People's Meritorious Person who has been awarded a Special Class Merit three times and a Major Merit four times; Gao Shijie, a Second Class Merit recipient and driver in a transportation unit who has driven safely for 40,000 kilometers; Wu Guoli, a Second Class Merit recipient and female nurse squad leader; Wang Bingfu, a First Class Merit recipient and political instructor of a Special Class Merit company in a certain unit; Gong Chuansheng, a First Class Merit recipient from a certain unit; and Li Guangyuan, a model party member. During the election, the officers and soldiers of each unit held tea parties, get-togethers, and song and dance evenings with great joy to warmly celebrate the convening of the election meeting. The elected representatives expressed to all officers and soldiers of the army and the people of the motherland that they must maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition, work hard, earnestly study and implement the party's general line and general tasks during the transition period, and contribute everything to defend and support the socialist construction of the motherland and defend peace in the Far East and the world.
    The election work for the People's Congress in the Tibet Military Region has been successfully completed. The Tibet Military Region has held its Servicemen's Representative Assembly for the entire military region, electing representatives to attend the Southwest Military Region's Servicemen's Representative Assembly. The cadres and soldiers of the Tibet Military Region participated in the election activities with high political enthusiasm. In mid-November, all units of the Tibet Military Region participating in road construction, production, and garrisoning successively established election committees. All units conducted full mobilization and education before universally starting grassroots elections. The cadres and soldiers deliberated and discussed each representative's election repeatedly. By early December, the grassroots election work of the Tibet Military Region's units had concluded successively. The Tibet Military Region's Servicemen's Representative Assembly was held on the 20th of this month, at which representatives to attend the Southwest Military Region's Servicemen's Representative Assembly were elected. Among the elected representatives were outstanding cadres, soldiers, combat heroes, and work models, including Zhang Guohua, Commander of the Tibet Military Region; Liu Zhenguo, Director of the Political Department; Zhu Xingzhen, a combat hero who attended the National Combat Heroes Representative Conference; and Yuan Kezhong, a work model. After the election work, the cadres and soldiers generally reflected: we have all satisfactorily elected the people we trust most.
    Furthermore, the Central South Military Region, the Fourth Field Army's affiliated army, navy, air force, and the people's armed forces are combining the general line publicity and are actively carrying out the election, most of the troops can basically end within this month.
    All units attach great importance to the election work. Leadership organs at all levels have established election committees. The Central South Military Region Election Committee is chaired by Political Commissar Tan Zheng, with Liang Biye, Deputy Director of the Political Department, as Vice Chairman. Election committees at all levels are carrying out their work under the personal guidance of the unit leaders.
    Before the election, the entire army universally carried out study. Some units invited people to give special reports on the election and sent cadres to participate in local election training classes. At the same time, the entire army launched large-scale and diverse publicity activities to make the broad masses of officers and soldiers value and cherish their political rights. The officers and soldiers regarded participating in the election as their glory. Every candidate was carefully studied, and the officers and soldiers unanimously stated: we must not be careless, we must elect the best people.
    The representatives produced in this election are all outstanding figures supported and loved by the officers and soldiers. Among the representatives are unit leaders, cadres at all levels, cultural instructors, soldiers, and communicators, among whom meritorious persons and models account for a large proportion.
    The election has further enhanced the patriotism of the troops and strengthened the sense of responsibility of officers and soldiers to defend the motherland. Soldier Xie Yanfeng said: "The people are now masters of the country, we must increase our vigilance a hundredfold and defend the construction of the motherland."
