Continue Deepening the Propaganda of the General Line Among Farmers

The large-scale work of propagating the general line to farmers, which began in various parts of the country in November of last year, has achieved great success. After more than two months of propaganda and education, the atmosphere of loving socialism, building socialism, supporting the country's socialist industrialization, and participating in the socialist transformation of agriculture has spread throughout the rural areas; the political consciousness of our farmers has greatly improved. Encouraged by the general line, farmers are enthusiastically selling "patriotic grain" and "socialist construction grain." Nationally, the grain purchase work has been completed in some areas and is about to be completed in others. Encouraged by the general line, the production enthusiasm and the eagerness to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement of the broad masses of farmers have reached unprecedented heights. They say: "Now we are managing our own small households, but joining the cooperative (agricultural production cooperative) is like running a big household," "In the past, organizing was like a gust of wind, collapsing in the summer after being organized in the spring. This time, we must steer with the wind and run all the way to socialism." In the process of propagating the general line, mutual aid and cooperative organizations in rural areas have also been widely developed. From this, it can be seen that the general line is indeed the driving force for continuously advancing all work. Once it is grasped by the broad masses of farmers, it immediately generates tremendous material strength. From this, it can be seen that in promoting all work in rural areas, we must implement the policy of propaganda, education, and ideological mobilization, and the regular and basic content of this propaganda and education is the general line for the transition period of the country. As long as the farmers truly follow the general line and act consciously and voluntarily, all rural work can be done well.

Therefore, all localities should seize the current favorable opportunity, continue to deepen the propaganda of the general line among farmers, successfully complete the grain purchase work, and appropriately guide the socialist enthusiasm of the farmers to winter production, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and spring plowing preparation work.

As everyone knows, the central link of all current rural work is to develop production. To develop production, it is necessary to develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Otherwise, agricultural production cannot be truly developed. Even if the production of a few people develops, and they even get rich, the majority of people will fall into poverty. This is the capitalist road, which is not beneficial to the broad masses of farmers. However, developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement requires changing the habits of individual management that farmers have had for thousands of years, which is certainly a very arduous undertaking. If we cannot continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the farmers, the mutual aid and cooperation movement cannot develop healthily. Therefore, continuing to deepen the propaganda of the general line among farmers is a regular and top-priority task in rural work. Some people think that the work of propagating the general line to the farmers has already been deepened and they can take a breather. This understanding is wrong. Farmers accept socialism only based on their own personal life experiences, based on the actual things they can see or imagine. They often look one step, take one step, take one step, and look one step. Only when the understanding of the first step is put into practice can they be determined to take the second step. Only when they see others successfully taking the first step do they have the courage to follow. Therefore, we must deepen the propaganda of the general line step by step according to the development of farmers' production, the progress of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the improvement of their lives, and constantly enrich the content of this propaganda. Of course, the propaganda of the general line must not be separated from the current practical work, let alone from the large-scale mutual aid and cooperation movement that is beginning. Because the purpose of propagating the general line is to make farmers accept the socialist transformation of agriculture, and developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement is the basic content of realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture. We must use the propaganda of the general line as the driving force for developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, so that the broad masses of farmers receive preliminary education first, so that they can further recognize the correctness of the general line in the process of the movement and more consciously support the general line.

Experience has proven that using various forms of propaganda and conducting large-scale propaganda is a very effective method. Its advantage is that it can create a upsurge, form public opinion, enable the broad masses of farmers to conduct extensive self-education in the movement, enable the advanced elements walking in the front to receive due praise and encouragement, enable the people in the middle state to quickly catch up, and enable the ideologically backward people to be improved by the influence of everyone. In short, it enables all farmers to quickly move forward. However, if we are only satisfied with large-scale general propaganda, if we think that farmers can thoroughly understand the general line by attending a few meetings and hearing some explanations, then we are completely wrong. In fact, one or two large-scale propaganda campaigns cannot completely solve the ideological problems of all farmers. In order to gradually improve the thinking of farmers, it is necessary to continuously carry out in-depth and specific education along with the development of various practical work.

We know that due to the limitations of various historical conditions, the development of economy and culture in rural areas of our country is very uneven; due to the different times of liberation, the work base of the Party in rural areas is also very different. In addition, our farmers have been engaged in individual production for thousands of years, and each household is a production unit. Due to the development of production, changes in life, the increase or decrease of population, and reasons such as weddings, funerals, and diseases, each household has different differences in specific requirements and specific ideas. If we do not pay attention to this specific difference in propaganda and other work, we cannot make the policies of the Party and the government touch everyone's heart. Therefore, whether it is grain purchase work or the mutual aid and cooperation movement, we should implement the policy of "adapting to local conditions" and "adapting to people." "Adapting to local conditions" means that we cannot force the movement to be uniform and consistent in steps, but must take care of the differences between counties and counties, districts and districts, townships and townships, and even take care of the differences between households in a village, and proceed in order. Otherwise, if we force uniformity, there will inevitably be a tendency to formalism, which will make the advanced parts stuck and not move forward, or implement compulsory orders on the backward parts. "Adapting to people" means conducting different propaganda education and other work for different characteristics of different types of objects (such as emancipated peasants, old middle peasants, labor models, demobilized soldiers, the elderly, women, etc.), and using "one key to open one lock." Moreover, we must not only pay attention to the different situations of various types of objects, but also pay attention to the different situations of different objects in various types. Even the same person often undergoes great changes in different periods, which should be noted. For example, some farmers initially volunteered to sell surplus grain, but later expressed their unwillingness to sell, or requested to reduce the amount of grain sold. Some farmers initially participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and even became active members of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, but later gradually became passive, and even requested to withdraw from the group and the society, and so on. These situations often occur in rural areas, and if they are not handled properly, problems may occur. In fact, this situation is very natural, because farmers are small producers and small private owners, and their thoughts and requirements are constantly changing with the changes in production and life.

At the same time, since individual farmers take the family as a production unit, many farmers are also affected by the family when dealing with important issues. Generally speaking, young farmers accept new things relatively quickly, and can quickly respond to the calls of the Party and the government in various tasks. However, they are not in charge of the family, and major issues involving the entire family depend on the head of the family. Therefore, in the grain purchase work, some localities held some "family meetings" to enlighten everyone to educate each other, unify their thinking, eliminate doubts, and reduce resistance, which proved to be very effective. The propaganda of the general line must be "known to every household," that is, it must penetrate into every farmer's family so that everyone is educated. In rural work, the so-called "starting from reality" means starting from the actual situation of the small peasant economy, and when carrying out the work specifically, it is even more necessary to start from the specific situation of each household and each person. The arduousness of educating farmers and the reason why educating farmers must be very meticulous, in-depth, and specific are expressed in this place.

The experience of this grain purchase work proves that farmers can completely accept socialism, but socialist education must be carried out among farmers based on their personal experiences and the degree to which they can understand it, from the shallow to the deep, appropriately, and never conduct empty preaching that makes farmers elusive, let alone exaggerate, which causes farmers to misunderstand. Our purpose in propagating the general line to farmers is to make them gradually realize the backwardness of the small peasant economy and consciously embark on the road of mutual aid and cooperation. However, due to the limitations of various conditions, farmers are very familiar with the old road, but very unfamiliar with the new road. Therefore, when conducting propaganda and education, we must be very cautious and steady, and never be impatient, let alone frustrate the enthusiasm of farmers' individual economy and production enthusiasm with one-sided and inappropriate remarks. We must make farmers realize the limitations of the small peasant economy in developing production and improving life, and realize the necessity of participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, but never cause farmers to have the illusion that they will not be allowed to work alone in the future, so as to cause the opposition between organized farmers and individual farmers. We must encourage surplus grain households to sell grain to the state, so that they realize that hoarding grain and not selling it is wrong, and selling it to private merchants is even more wrong, but never cause them to have the illusion that it is not glorious to have surplus grain, and it is glorious to be poor. We must make farmers realize that the current agricultural production cooperatives are a higher form of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, which are superior to mutual aid teams in all aspects and even more superior to individual farmers, but never cause them to have the illusion that mutual aid teams should not be organized, or that agricultural production cooperatives can be established casually without active preparation and without the necessary conditions. In the past year, the reason why some areas made mistakes of impatience and rashness in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and then made a laissez-faire tendency after correcting the impatience and rashness; the reason why cadres in some areas initially felt difficult in this grain purchase work, and then blindly optimistic, and then expressed loss of confidence and helplessness after some problems occurred, was all because they did not understand that farmers can accept socialism, but they must conduct comprehensive, appropriate, arduous, and long-term propaganda and education. This lesson should be paid attention to in all future rural work.

Experience has proven that an effective way to improve the socialist consciousness of farmers is to adopt the mass line method and mobilize farmers to conduct self-education. This requires good use of the activists who have emerged in various tasks, let them "speak from their own experience," and use vivid and specific examples to dispel the various ideological doubts of the masses. Because the ideological problems that activists have solved are often the problems that many people have not solved. Therefore, the activists' self-introduction to the situation of ideological transformation and the process of gradually understanding and experiencing the Party's policies can most touch and influence the general public. In this grain purchase work, Hebei and many other regions selected and cultivated activists among various types of farmers, helped them analyze their thinking, study policies, and then held report meetings of typical people for them to conduct propaganda. For example, the activists in surplus grain households reported the ideological changes before and after selling grain, and the methods of arranging their own production and life, and so on. When summarizing the grain purchase work and developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, Shandong and other regions mobilized the activists in the mutual aid and cooperation movement to report to the masses the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation they had obtained, their understanding of the general line education this time, and their plans to lead the masses to develop mutual aid and cooperation in the future; they mobilized Party members and cadres who had not actively participated in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the past to appropriately conduct self-criticism to the masses, and reported the process of ideological transformation and future determination after receiving the general line education, which effectively enlightened the broad masses of farmers and promoted the grain purchase work and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

In the past period of large-scale propaganda of the general line to farmers, all localities have created many good experiences. For example, the experience of combining education and action, educating while acting, created by Licheng, Shandong, is one of many good experiences. Licheng took the in-depth propaganda of the general line as the driving force to carry out winter production, mutual aid and cooperation, and grain purchase work, so that farmers gradually understood the principles of developing production and selling surplus grain, and thus consciously and voluntarily acted. In the entire work process, they implemented the "assembly line operation" method of layer-by-layer mobilization, following education and moving, and gradually developing. First, they carried out propaganda and organization work in typical groups. After the ideological education of the typical groups matured, they first sold surplus grain under the leadership of activists. In this way, one group led several groups, advanced groups led backward groups, from point to surface, from the few to the many, the masses' thinking was clear, and they would consciously and voluntarily sell grain. If the masses had not figured it out yet, they would be educated again. As a result, the movement was always normal and healthy. This method is completely suitable for the law that the masses' consciousness is uneven, the law that the development of the mass movement is unbalanced, and the law that the consciousness of the broad masses must be gradually improved. Its advantage is that it can fully develop the leading role of advanced elements, facilitate waiting for the consciousness of backward masses, truly implement the principle of consciousness and voluntariness, and effectively prevent the occurrence of compulsory orders.

Now the large-scale mutual aid and cooperation movement is beginning. All localities should summarize similar experiences of propagating the general line in a timely manner, carry forward the advantages, correct various deviations and errors, use various effective methods, and conduct more in-depth propaganda and education to farmers, and truly use the general line as the driving force for promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

### 继续向农民深入宣传总路线

    继续向农民深入宣传总路线
    全国各地从去年十一月开始的大张旗鼓向农民宣传总路线的工作，业已取得极大的成绩。经过两个多月的宣传教育，热爱社会主义，建设社会主义，支持国家社会主义工业化的建设，参加对农业的社会主义改造的气象，遍及全国的农村；我国农民的政治觉悟大大提高了一步。在总路线的鼓舞之下，农民踊跃出售“爱国粮”、“社会主义建设粮”。从全国范围来说，购粮工作有的地区已经结束，有的地区就要结束了。在总路线的鼓舞之下，广大农民的生产热情和参加互助合作运动的积极性空前高涨，他们说：“现在当小家，入社（农业生产合作社）当大家”，“过去组织起来一阵风，春组织夏垮台，这次要顺风掌舵，一气跑到社会主义”。在宣传总路线过程中，农村的互助合作组织也有了广泛的发展。由此可见，总路线确实是推动一切工作不断前进的动力，它一旦为广大农民群众所掌握，立刻就产生了巨大的物质力量。由此可见，我们在农村推行一切工作，都必须贯彻宣传教育、思想发动的方针，而这种宣传教育的经常的基本的内容，就是国家过渡时期的总路线；只要农民群众真正遵循总路线自觉自愿地行动起来，一切农村工作都能够做得很好。
    因此，各地应该抓紧当前有利的时机，继续深入向农民宣传总路线，圆满地完成购粮工作，并把农民群众的社会主义热情，适时地引导到冬季生产、互助合作运动和春耕生产准备工作中去。
    大家知道，当前一切农村工作的中心环节是发展生产。为了发展生产，又必须发展互助合作运动。否则，农业生产就不可能真正获得发展，即使有少数人的生产发展了，甚至经营发财了，多数人也要陷于贫困，这是资本主义的道路，对广大农民是不利的。但发展互助合作运动，却需要改变农民千百年来个体经营的习惯，这当然是一件十分艰巨的事业。如果不能继续不断地提高农民群众的社会主义觉悟，互助合作运动就不能健康地发展起来。因此，继续深入地向农民宣传总路线，乃是农村工作中的一项经常的、头等重要的任务。有些人认为现在对农民群众宣传总路线的工作已经深入了，可以松一口气了，这种认识是错误的。农民接受社会主义，只能根据他们自己的切身生活经验，根据他们看得见的或想得到的实际事物。他们常常是看一步、走一步，走一步、看一步，第一步的认识见诸实践了，才能下定决心走第二步。看见别人走第一步成功了，自己才有勇气跟着走。所以，我们必须根据农民生产发展的情况，互助合作运动进展的情况，生活提高的情况，一步步地深入总路线的宣传，并不断丰富这个宣传的内容。当然，宣传总路线绝不能脱离当前的实际工作，更不能脱离正在开始的大规模的互助合作运动。因为宣传总路线的目的是使农民接受对农业的社会主义改造，而发展互助合作运动正是实现对农业的社会主义改造的基本内容。我们必须把宣传总路线作为发展互助合作运动的推动力量，使广大农民首先受到初步教育，这才能使他们在运动过程中进一步认识总路线的正确，更加自觉地拥护总路线。
    经验证明，运用各种宣传形式，进行大张旗鼓的宣传，这是一种非常有效的方法。它的好处是能够掀起热潮，形成舆论，使广大农民群众在运动中进行广泛的自我教育，使走在前面的积极分子得到应有的表扬和鼓励，使处在中间状态的人能够迅速赶上去，使思想落后的人受到大家的影响而获得提高，总之，使全体农民都能够迅速前进一步。但是，如果仅仅满足于大张旗鼓的普遍宣传，如果认为农民参加几次大会，听到一些讲解，就能够彻底懂得总路线，这就完全错了。实际上，一两次大张旗鼓的宣传，绝不能彻底解决全体农民的思想问题。为了使农民的思想逐步获得提高，必须随着各种实际工作的发展，不断进行深入的、具体的教育。
    我们知道，我国农村由于各种历史条件的限制，在经济、文化的发展上是很不平衡的；由于解放时间早晚不同，党在各地农村中的工作基础也有很大的差别。加以我国农民几千年来都是进行个体生产，一家一户就是一个生产单位，由于生产的发展，生活的变化，人口的增减以及婚丧疾病等原因，使各户农民在具体要求和具体思想上，都有着大小不同的差别。我们在宣传上和其他工作中，如果不注意这种具体的差别，就不能使党和政府的政策打动每个人的心坎。因此，购粮工作也好，互助合作运动也好，都应该实行“因地制宜”、“因人制宜”的方针。“因地制宜”，这就是不能强使运动整齐划一，步骤一致，而必须照顾县与县、区与区、乡与乡之间的差别，甚至照顾一村之内各户之间的差别，分别先后，循序前进。否则，如果强求一致，就必然发生形式主义的偏向，使先进部分胶着不前，或对落后部分实行强迫命令。“因人制宜”，就是针对不同类型的对象的不同特点（如翻身农民，老中农，劳动模范，退伍军人，老年人，妇女，等等），进行不同的宣传教育和其他工作，用“一把钥匙开一把锁”。而且，不仅要注意各种不同类型的对象的不同情况，还要注意各种类型中不同对象的不同情况。就是同一个人，也往往在不同时期发生很大的变化，这都是要注意的。譬如，有些农民，最初自报出卖余粮，以后又表示不愿出卖，或要求减少售粮的数目。有些农民，最初参加了互助合作组织，甚至是互助合作组织中的积极分子，但以后逐渐消极起来，甚至要求退组退社，等等。这些情况在农村中是常常发生的，如果处理不当，就可能发生问题。其实，这种情形是很自然的，因为农民是小生产者和小私有者，他们的思想和要求，经常随着生产、生活的变化而变化。
    同时，由于个体农民是以家庭为生产单位，许多农民在处理重要问题时，还受到家庭的影响。一般说来，青年农民接受新事物比较快，在各种工作中都能迅速响应党和政府的号召。但他们在家庭中并不主事，涉及整个家庭的重大问题，都要取决于家长。因此，各地在购粮工作中，召开了一些“家庭会议”，启发大家互相教育，统一思想，排除疑难，减少阻力，证明是很有效果的。总路线的宣传要作到“家喻户晓”，就是要深入到每一个农家之中，使大家都受到教育。在农村工作中，所谓“从实际出发”，就是要从小农经济的实际状况出发，而在具体进行工作时，更要从每一户每一人的具体情况出发。教育农民的艰苦性，教育农民必须十分细致、深入、具体的道理就表现在这个地方。
    这次购粮工作的经验证明，农民是完全可以接受社会主义的，但对农民进行社会主义教育，必须根据他们的切身经验和他们能够理解的程度，由浅入深地、恰合分寸地进行，绝不可进行空洞的说教，使农民不可捉摸，更不可言过其实，使农民发生误解。我们对农民宣传总路线的目的，是使他们逐步认识小农经济的落后性，自觉地走上互助合作的道路。但农民由于各种条件的限制，对旧道路非常熟悉，对新道路却很生疏，因此，在进行宣传教育的时候，必须十分谨慎、稳重，绝不可急躁从事，更不能以片面的不适当的说法挫折农民个体经济的积极性和生产积极性。我们必须使农民认识小农经济对于发展生产和改善生活的限制性，认识参加互助合作运动的必要性，但绝不可引起农民的错觉，认为今后就不允许他们单干，以致引起组织起来的农民和个体农民的对立。必须鼓励余粮户把粮食卖给国家，使他们认识囤粮不卖是不对的，卖给私商更是不对的，但绝不可引起他们的错觉，以为有余粮就不光荣，贫穷反而光荣。必须使农民认识目前的农业生产合作社是互助合作组织的较高级的形式，它在各方面都比互助组优越，比单干农民更要优越，但绝不可引起他们的错觉，以为互助组是不应该组织的，或者可以不经过积极准备，不具备必要的条件，就能够马马虎虎地成立农业生产合作社。去年某些地区在互助合作运动中所以发生了急躁冒进的错误，而在纠正急躁冒进后又发生了放任自流的偏向；这次购粮工作中，有些地区的干部所以最初感到困难，以后又盲目乐观，而在发生一些问题后又表示丧失信心、束手无策，都是由于不懂得农民可以接受社会主义，但必须进行全面的、切当的、艰苦的、长期的宣传教育的道理。这个教训，在今后一切农村工作中都要加以注意。
    经验证明，提高农民的社会主义觉悟的有效办法，就是采用群众路线的方式，发动农民进行自我教育。这就必须很好地使用各种工作中涌现出来的积极分子，由他们“现身说法”，以生动具体事例，解除群众各种思想疑虑。由于积极分子已经解决了的思想问题，常常是许多群众还没有解决的，因此，由积极分子自我介绍思想转变的情形和逐步认识、体会党的政策的过程，最能感动和影响一般群众。河北及其他许多地区，在这次购粮工作中，选择和培养各种类型的农民中的积极分子，帮助他们分析思想，学习政策，然后召开典型人报告会，由他们进行宣传。譬如，由余粮户中的积极分子报告卖粮前后的思想变化，安排自己的生产和生活的办法等等。山东及其他地区，在总结购粮工作和发展互助合作运动的时候，发动互助合作运动中的积极分子向群众报告自己得到的互助合作的好处，这次接受总路线教育的心得，和今后领导群众发展互助合作的计划；发动过去未积极参加互助合作运动的党员、干部向群众适当地进行检讨，并报告接受总路线教育后思想转变的经过和今后的决心，都有效地启发了广大农民，推动了购粮工作和互助合作运动。
    在过去一个时期向农民大张旗鼓宣传总路线的工作中，各地都创造了许多良好的经验。例如，山东历城创造的教育和行动相结合，一面教育一面行动的经验，就是许多良好经验中的一个。历城以深入宣传总路线为动力，开展冬季生产、互助合作和购粮工作，使农民逐步懂得了发展生产，出售余粮的道理，从而自觉自愿地行动起来。他们在整个工作过程中，实行了层层发动、随教随动、逐步开展的“流水作业”的方法，首先在典型组进行宣传和组织工作，典型组思想教育成熟后，即在积极分子带动下首先出售余粮。这样由一个组带动几个组，由先进组带动落后组，由点到面，由少数到多数，群众思想通了，就会自觉自愿地出售粮食，群众如果尚未想通，就再进行教育。结果运动始终是正常的、健康的。这种方法完全适合群众觉悟参差不齐的规律，适合群众运动发展不平衡的规律，适合广大群众的觉悟一定是逐步提高的规律。它的好处是能够充分发扬先进分子的带头作用，便于等待落后群众的觉悟，真正贯彻自觉自愿的原则，有效地防止强迫命令的发生。
    现在大规模的互助合作运动正在开始。各地应该把类似的宣传总路线的经验，及时加以总结，发扬优点，纠正各种偏差和错误，运用各种有效的方式，对农民进行更加深入的宣传教育，把总路线真正作为推动互助合作运动的动力。
