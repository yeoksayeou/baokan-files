    After receiving education on the general line, farmers in many areas of Southwest China have displayed a surge in production enthusiasm and are actively carrying out winter water storage and conservation work to ensure a good harvest for the spring crops and prepare for spring plowing. Farmers in areas such as Yiliang and Zhaotong Special Districts in Yunnan Province and Ya'an and Xichang Special Districts in Xikang Province, after being educated on the general line, are using part of the money from selling surplus grain to dig ponds, repair weirs, and open ditches to store water and divert water for irrigation. In some villages and townships of Luxi and Jiangchuan Counties in Yunnan Province, farmers have already dug 34 ditches, repaired 12 dams, and repaired more than 40 ponds, not only storing water but also turning some dry land near the ditches into fertile fields. Farmers in Baipo Township, Zhaotong County, after studying the general line, have greatly increased their enthusiasm for production. The entire township mobilized more than 500 people to repair a sluice gate that can irrigate more than 2,000 mu of land. Then, they mobilized more than 600 people to repair a gate chamber ditch in two days, and the gate pond is now full of water. Farmers in some mountainous and hilly areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan Provinces, such as the Fuling and Wanxian Special Districts, were inspired by patriotism and production enthusiasm while studying the general line, correcting the thinking of some farmers who were "waiting for rain to irrigate the fields." Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, along with individual farmers, have incorporated water storage and conservation into their winter production plans and are adopting various methods to store water. In Guizhou Province, the members of the mutual aid teams of Fan Youfu and Fan Cailin in Bijie County used "bucket digging" to irrigate high fields and manufactured "water dragons" to pump water to irrigate fields, providing a good way to store water in low-lying areas. Farmers in Fuling, Changshou, and Daxian and other places in Sichuan Province are now carrying out winter paddy field water storage work to ensure that there is water for rice transplanting this spring.

    西南区农民积极进行冬季蓄水保水工作
    西南许多地区的农民受到总路线教育后，生产情绪高涨，都积极进行冬季蓄水保水工作，为保证小春丰收和春耕生产作好准备。云南省宜良、昭通等专区和西康省雅安、西昌等专区的农民，受到总路线教育，把卖余粮的部分款子用来挖塘、修堰、开沟，以便蓄水和引水灌溉。云南省泸西、江川等县部分乡村的农民，已挖好水沟三十四条，修整水坝十二座，修塘四十多口，不仅蓄水，还使沟渠附近部分干土变成良田。昭通县白坡乡农民学习了总路线，增产热情高涨，全乡出动了五百多人把一座能灌溉二千多亩田的水闸修好。接着又出动六百多人在两天内修好了一条闸房沟，现在闸塘里已经蓄满了水。云南、贵州和四川省的涪陵、万县等专区部分山区和丘陵地带的农民，在学习总路线中激发了爱国增产热情，纠正了部分农民“等雨灌田”的思想。许多农业生产合作社和互助组并带动单干农民，把蓄水保水工作订入冬季生产计划，采用多种方法蓄水。贵州省毕节县范有富、范才林等互助组的组员用“打挖桶”灌高田，和制造“水龙”抽水灌田，给水位低的地区提供了蓄水的好办法。四川省涪陵、长寿、达县等地的农民，现正进行冬水田蓄水工作，保证今春有水插秧。（新华社）
