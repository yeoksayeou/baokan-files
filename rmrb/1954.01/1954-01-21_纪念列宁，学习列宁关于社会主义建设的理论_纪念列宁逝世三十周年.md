    Commemorate Lenin and Study Lenin's Theory of Socialist Construction
    —Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of Lenin's Death
    Today is the 30th anniversary of the death of Lenin, the leader and teacher of the working people of the world, the greatest thinker and revolutionary. We, the Chinese people, together with the Soviet people and all progressive mankind, commemorate his immortal revolutionary cause and his immeasurable great contributions to mankind. Lenin's name has become a symbol of the new world, and has become the most glorious banner for the progressive mankind of the world in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. The great image of Lenin lives in the hearts of the working people of the world. Time can never erase the brilliance of Lenin's genius.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded by Lenin and Stalin, led the workers and peasants of the Soviet Union in the great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era in human history—the new era of the decline of capitalism and the birth of socialism. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union led the Soviet people in a victorious struggle against domestic and foreign enemies during the period of domestic war and armed intervention, defending the socialist motherland; in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, it defeated the aggressors of German, Italian, and Japanese fascism, defended the socialist motherland of the Soviet Union, and helped the countries and peoples enslaved and invaded by fascism to achieve liberation. During several Five-Year Plans, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union led the Soviet people, overcame all difficulties, and carried forward the spirit of hard struggle, building the Soviet Union into a bright and splendid socialist country.
    Lenin was the great leader of the people of all countries because he pointed out to the people of all countries the method of getting rid of imperialist enslavement and the road to establishing socialism. Stalin said in the article "In Memory of Lenin": "...Lenin was not only the leader of the Russian proletariat, not only the leader of the European workers, not only the leader of the colonial East, but also the leader of the entire working class of the globe."
  Lenin was a scientific master of Marxism. In the new historical conditions, namely the era of imperialism and the era of proletarian revolution, Lenin, based on the principles stipulated by Marx and Engels, creatively developed and enriched Marxism, and pushed Marxism to a new and higher stage. Based on the basic principles of "Capital," Lenin made a scientific analysis of imperialism, pointed out that it was the last stage of capitalism, pointed out the conditions for the inevitable demise of imperialism, and thus derived a famous principle: under imperialism, due to the law of uneven development of capitalism, the socialist revolution can win victory in a single country. Lenin demonstrated the tactical issues of the proletarian revolutionary struggle according to the class struggle situation in the era of imperialism. Lenin developed Marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the theory of the worker-peasant alliance led by the proletariat, and discovered that the Soviet regime was the best state form and political form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and was the highest form of democracy. Lenin developed the theory of the transition period from capitalism to socialism, and for the first time demonstrated that a proletarian dictatorship state surrounded by imperialism could build a complete socialist society. Lenin made many new and great contributions in the fields of national and colonial issues, proletarian leadership, and proletarian political parties. Stalin gave the most correct definition of Leninism: "Leninism is Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. To be more precise, Leninism in general is the theory and tactics of the proletarian revolution, especially the theory and tactics of the proletarian dictatorship." ("On the Foundations of Leninism")
    Lenin's theory on the transition period from capitalism to socialism is an important component of Marxism-Leninism and one of Lenin's outstanding contributions to scientific communism. Stalin pointed out that Lenin's new contributions in this regard were: he demonstrated that a complete socialist society could be built in a proletarian dictatorship state surrounded by imperialism; he formulated specific methods of economic policy—the "New Economic Policy," enabling the proletarian state holding the economic lifeline to use specific methods to combine socialist industry and agriculture, thereby leading the entire national economy to socialism; he formulated a plan for building a socialist society, the method of which was to industrialize the country and attract peasants to participate in the socialist construction cause through cooperatives.
    When Lenin stipulated the road for socialist construction in the Soviet Union, he emphasized the importance of developing heavy industry. As early as the eve of the great October Revolution, Lenin emphasized that Russia should surpass the most developed capitalist countries not only in the political aspect, but also in the economic and technical aspects, which was a matter of life and death for Russia. In Lenin's works, the importance of establishing the material basis of socialism by developing industry (especially heavy industry) was repeatedly emphasized. For example, Lenin said in "The Fifth Anniversary of the Russian Revolution and the Prospects of the World Revolution": "Without saving heavy industry, without restoring heavy industry, we cannot build any industry, and without industry, we cannot maintain our status as an independent country at all. We know this very well." In the communist transformation of the country, he particularly emphasized the importance of electrification. Lenin taught us that a communist society can only be built when the country is densely covered with a distribution network of power stations. Lenin's ideas on the development of heavy industry and electrification are particularly clearly reflected in the All-Russian Electrification Plan formulated in December 1920 according to Lenin's instructions. This plan was a plan to transfer the entire national economy to the technical basis of modern large-scale production.
    In order to build socialism in a country where the small-scale peasant economy predominated, Lenin profoundly studied the problem of carrying out socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy and attracting laboring peasants to participate in socialist construction. To this end, Lenin formulated the brilliant cooperative plan as a specific method to gradually guide the basic masses of peasants onto the track of socialist construction. He believed that the cooperative system was the most powerful tool for the dictatorship of the proletariat to transform the small-scale peasant economy and educate the basic masses of peasants in the socialist spirit. Lenin wrote: "Under the New Economic Policy, fully, broadly, and profoundly cooperating the residents of Russia is all we need, because we have now found the standard to combine private interests, private business interests with the interests of state inspection and supervision, so that private interests obey the interests of the whole, and this was an unsolvable problem for many socialists before." ("On Cooperation")
    When Lenin began to implement the New Economic Policy, he also put forward the method of guiding capitalism to state capitalism, so that it could serve socialist construction along a certain track under the leadership of the state.
    All these ideas of Lenin on economic construction have been further developed in Stalin's works. Stalin made a profound study of Lenin's idea of industrialization and summarized the experience of the struggle of the Soviet Union in implementing the policy of industrialization. Thus, he made a systematic and scientific demonstration on a series of issues such as the method of national industrialization, the speed, the funds, and the cadres.
    The theories of Lenin and Stalin on socialist economic construction have now been vividly proved by the practice of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has become the most advanced industrial country in the world with highly developed collective agriculture. It has undergone severe tests in the Great Patriotic War. The Soviet Union has become a powerful and invincible fortress in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. Now the Soviet people are confidently advancing towards the bright road of communism. This fully demonstrates the infinite correctness and invincible power of Marxist-Leninist ideology.
    The theories of Lenin and Stalin on the transition period and the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union have great international significance. Lenin predicted long ago: "...all countries can see from the example of Russia certain events that they will inevitably encounter in the near future, and they are extremely important events." ("'Left-Wing' Communism: an Infantile Disorder") Now, our country is in a transitional period of gradually transitioning to a socialist society. The general line and general task of the Party in this transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a relatively long period of time, and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the state's agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. This line of our Party is determined according to the theories of Lenin and Stalin on the transition period and in accordance with the specific conditions of China.
    In 1953, our country began the first Five-Year Plan for socialist construction. Its basic task is to concentrate major forces to develop heavy industry, so as to establish the foundation for national industrialization and the modernization of national defense; and correspondingly train construction talents, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture and commerce; systematically promote the collectivization of agriculture and handicrafts, continue to transform capitalist industry and commerce, while correctly exerting the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; ensure the steady growth of socialist components in the national economy, and ensure the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of developing production. This plan for socialist construction is also formulated according to the theories of Lenin and Stalin on socialist industrialization. The experience of socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union, the experience of transforming individual agriculture through cooperatives, and the experience of using the power of the regime to carry out socialist construction are all our best examples. From this, we can know how important it is for us to study the theories of Lenin and Stalin on socialist construction and the experience of economic construction in the Soviet Union.
    In "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" in 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "At the beginning, some people in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union did not know how to run the economy, and the imperialists had waited for their failure. But the CPSU was victorious. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, they not only knew how to make revolution, but also how to build. They have built a great, glorious and splendid socialist country. The CPSU is our best teacher, and we must learn from the CPSU." In the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Theoretical Education of Cadres in 1953-1954," it was stipulated that the senior and intermediate groups of cadres' theoretical study in the whole party should complete the study of Chapters 9 to 12 of the History of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) and a part of the works of Lenin and Stalin on socialist economic construction within a year and a half. This study plan is precisely to meet the needs of the whole party in the period of economic construction, and requires the main cadres of the whole party to systematically understand the basic laws of the Soviet Union in realizing national industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and completing socialist construction, so as to correctly utilize the experience of the Soviet Union in the process of economic construction in our country according to the specific conditions of our country.
    When we commemorate the 30th anniversary of Lenin's death, we must follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and on the basis of the existing learning achievements, study Marxism-Leninism more diligently, more deeply, and more systematically, especially study the theories of Lenin and Stalin on socialist construction and the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and struggle to realize the general line of the Party in the transition period and to build a glorious and splendid socialist country like the Soviet Union.

    纪念列宁，学习列宁关于社会主义建设的理论
    ——纪念列宁逝世三十周年
    今天是全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师、最伟大的思想家和革命家——列宁逝世三十周年的日子。我们中国人民和苏联人民及全世界进步人类一起，都纪念他的永垂不朽的革命事业及其对人类无可估量的伟大贡献。列宁的名字已成为新世界的象征，已成为全世界进步人类在争取和平、民主与社会主义斗争中最辉煌的旗帜。列宁的伟大的形象活在全世界劳动人民的心里。时间永远磨灭不了列宁的天才的光辉。
    列宁和斯大林缔造的苏联共产党，曾领导苏联的工人和农民进行了伟大的十月社会主义革命，从此开辟了人类历史的新纪元——资本主义衰亡和社会主义诞生的新纪元。苏联共产党曾领导苏联人民，在国内战争和武装干涉时期同国内外的敌人进行了胜利的斗争，保卫了社会主义的祖国；在一九四一——一九四五年的卫国战争中击败了德意日法西斯主义的侵略者，保卫了苏联社会主义的祖国，并帮助被法西斯奴役和侵略的国家和人民取得了解放。在几个五年计划期间，苏联共产党领导苏联人民，克服一切困难，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，把苏联建成了一个光明灿烂的社会主义国家。
    列宁是世界各国人民的伟大领袖，因为他对各国人民指出了摆脱帝国主义奴役的方法和建立社会主义的道路。斯大林在“追悼列宁”一文说过：“……列宁不仅是俄国无产阶级底领袖，不仅是欧洲工人底领袖，不仅是殖民地东方底领袖，而且是环球整个劳动界底领袖。”
  列宁是马克思主义科学大师。列宁在新的历史条件下，即帝国主义时代和无产阶级革命时代的条件下，以马克思和恩格斯所规定的原则为基础，创造性地发展了和丰富了马克思主义，把马克思主义推向新的更高的阶段。列宁曾依据“资本论”的基本原理，对帝国主义作了科学的分析，指出它是资本主义的最后阶段，指出帝国主义必然灭亡的条件，并从而得出一个著名的原理：在帝国主义条件下，由于资本主义发展不平衡的规律，社会主义革命可以在单独一个国家内获得胜利。列宁按照帝国主义时期的阶级斗争形势论证了无产阶级革命斗争的策略问题。列宁发展了马克思所创立的关于无产阶级专政的学说和以无产阶级为领导的工农联盟的学说，发现了苏维埃政权是无产阶级专政最好的国家形式及政权形式，是最高式样的民主制。列宁发展了由资本主义进到社会主义的过渡时期的理论，首次论证了无产阶级专政国家在帝国主义包围下可能建成完全的社会主义社会。列宁在关于民族与殖民地问题、无产阶级领导权问题和关于无产阶级政党问题等方面，都有许多新的伟大的贡献。斯大林曾给列宁主义下了一个最正确的定义：“列宁主义是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。更确切些说，列宁主义一般是无产阶级革命底理论和策略，特别是无产阶级专政底理论和策略。”（“论列宁主义基础”）
    列宁关于从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的理论，是马克思列宁主义重要的组成部分，是列宁对于科学共产主义的卓越贡献之一。斯大林曾指出，列宁在这方面的新的贡献是：他论证了在被帝国主义包围的无产阶级专政国家内可能建成完全的社会主义社会；他拟定了经济政策的具体办法——“新经济政策”，使握有经济命脉的无产阶级国家运用具体办法把社会主义工业与农业结合起来，从而把全部国民经济引向社会主义；他拟定了建设社会主义社会的计划，其方法就是使国家工业化，并经过合作社吸引农民来参加社会主义建设事业。
    列宁在为苏联的社会主义建设规定道路时，曾强调指出发展重工业的重要性。远在伟大的十月革命的前夜，列宁就曾着重指出，俄国不仅要在政治方面，而且要在经济与技术方面超过最发达的资本主义国家，这是俄国一个生死存亡的问题。在列宁的著作中，曾屡次强调了以发展工业（特别是重工业）来建立社会主义物质基础的重要性。例如列宁在“俄国革命五周年与世界革命底前途”中说道：“不挽救重工业，不恢复重工业，我们就不能建成任何工业，而没有工业，我们就根本不能维持我们之为独立国家的地位。这点我们知道得很清楚。”在国家的共产主义改造工作中，他特别强调电气化的重要性。列宁教导我们说，只有全国密布了电力站的分布网时，才能建成共产主义社会。列宁关于发展重工业和电气化的思想，特别鲜明地体现在依照列宁的指示于一九二○年十二月制订的全俄电气化计划中。这个计划是将整个国民经济转移到现代大规模生产的技术基础上去的计划。
    为了在小农经济占优势的国家中建设社会主义，列宁曾深刻地研究了对小农经济实行社会主义改造和吸引劳动农民参加社会主义建设的方法的问题。为此，列宁拟定天才的合作社计划，作为逐渐把基本农民群众引导到社会主义建设轨道上来的具体办法。他认为合作制是无产阶级专政用来改造小农经济，和以社会主义精神教育基本农民群众的最强有力的工具。列宁写道：“在新经济政策下，将俄国居民充分广泛充分深刻地合作化，这就是我们所需要的一切，因为我们现在找着了把私人利益、私人营业利益与由国家检查监督这一利益二者结合起来的标准，即使私人利益服从全体利益的标准，而这点对于以前许多社会主义者说来，曾是不可解决的难题。”（“论合作制”）
    列宁在开始实行新经济政策的时候，还提出了把资本主义引导到国家资本主义的办法，使其在国家领导下沿着一定的轨道为社会主义建设服务。
    列宁所有这些关于经济建设的思想，都在斯大林的著作中得到了进一步的发展。斯大林对列宁的工业化的思想作了深刻的研究，并总结了苏联实行工业化政策的斗争经验，从而关于国家工业化的方法问题、速度问题、资金问题、干部问题等等一系列的问题，他都作了系统的科学的论证。
    列宁斯大林关于社会主义经济建设的理论，现在已被苏联社会主义建设的实践活生生地证明了。苏联已经变成为世界上最先进的拥有高度发展的集体农业的工业国家。它在伟大的卫国战争中经受了严重的考验。苏联已成为和平、民主、社会主义阵营强大无敌的堡垒。现在苏联人民正满怀信心地朝着共产主义的光明大道前进。这充分显示了马克思列宁主义思想的无限正确性和百战百胜的威力。
    列宁斯大林关于过渡时期的理论、苏联社会主义建设的经验是具有伟大的国际意义的。列宁早就预言：“……所有一切国家正是从俄国的榜样中就能看见它们在不远将来所必然会遇到的某些事件，而且是极重大的事件。”（“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”）现在，我们的国家正处于逐步过渡到社会主义社会的过渡时期。党在这过渡时期的总路线和总任务，就是要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。我们党的这个路线，正是根据列宁斯大林关于过渡时期的理论和依照中国的具体情况而确定的。
    在一九五三年我国开始了社会主义建设的第一个五年计划。它的基本任务就是集中主要力量发展重工业，以建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；并相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和商业；有步骤地促进农业、手工业的合作化，继续进行对资本主义工商业的改造，同时正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的作用；保证国民经济中社会主义成分的稳步增长，保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民物质和文化生活水平。这个社会主义建设的计划，也正是根据列宁和斯大林关于社会主义工业化的理论而制订的。苏联社会主义工业化的经验、通过合作社改造个体农业的经验和运用政权的力量来实行社会主义建设的经验，都正是我们最好的榜样。从此，就可以知道学习列宁斯大林关于社会主义建设的理论和苏联经济建设的经验，对于我们具有如何重大的意义了。
    毛泽东同志一九四九年在“论人民民主专政”中说：“苏联共产党人开头也有一些人不会办经济，帝国主义者也曾等待过他们的失败。但是联共是胜利了，在列宁和斯大林领导之下，他们不但会革命，也会建设。他们已经建设起来了一个伟大的光辉灿烂的社会主义国家。联共就是我们的最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习。”在“中共中央关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”中曾规定：全党干部理论学习的高级组和中级组要在一年半时间内，都学完联共（布）党史第九章到十二章和列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设的一部分著作。这个学习计划，正是为了适应全党在经济建设时期的需要，要求全党主要干部都能有系统地了解苏联实现国家工业化、农业合作化和完成社会主义建设的基本规律，以便在我国经济建设过程中根据我国具体条件正确地利用苏联的经验。
    当我们纪念列宁逝世三十周年的时候，我们一定要遵照党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，在已有的学习成绩的基础上，更加努力、更加深入和更有系统地学习马克思列宁主义，特别是学习列宁斯大林关于社会主义建设的理论和苏联社会主义建设的经验，为实现党在过渡时期的总路线，为建设一个像苏联那样的光辉灿烂的社会主义国家而斗争。
