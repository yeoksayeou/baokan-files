At the activists' meeting held by the Yangqu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi, two vivid examples educated every party member present when reviewing past rural work based on the Party's General Line. One was Yang Yonglu, the secretary of the Party branch of Laotougou Village, who led the branch members to guide the villagers onto the road of collectivization advocated by the Party. They restored and developed production from the ruins of the "no-man's-land" created by the Yan Xishan bandits, enabling all the villagers to become prosperous. When an agricultural production cooperative was established in the spring of 1953, Yang Yonglu was elected as the director by the cooperative members. In stark contrast to the prosperity of the Laotougou farmers, Zhao Guilan, the secretary of the Fanzhuang branch, did not properly lead the branch's work after the land reform. He only cared about personal wealth and did not organize the masses for production. As a result, significant internal divisions occurred among the farmers in the village. Some became impoverished and bankrupt, while others hired long-term laborers. Zhao Guilan did not become wealthy and even became a hired laborer himself last autumn.

  A Place with Two Villages

These two villages are both located on the eastern mountains of Yangqu County. Laotougou is on the hillside, and Fanzhuang is at the foot of the mountain, only eight miles apart. When townships were divided last spring, the two villages were even placed in the same township.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, both villages were the most resolute in fighting the enemy. Yang Yonglu and Zhao Guilan were also known as heroes to the local farmers. In the autumn of 1947, when the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs established strongholds here and launched an anti-communist, anti-people war, the two village branches led the farmers in both villages to implement a policy of clearing the fields and fortifying the villages. They led the militia in a heroic struggle against the enemy, protecting the masses and successfully completing the autumn harvest. Later, they mobilized young people to join the People's Liberation Army and led the indomitable farmers of both villages to temporarily retreat to the old base area in Yu County, organizing farmers for production and successfully weathering the most difficult years of the People's Liberation War.

In the autumn of 1948, the People's Liberation Army removed the Yan Xishan bandit strongholds and liberated this area. The farmers who had retreated to the rear to produce in both villages also returned victoriously. In winter, the local Party and People's Government led the farmers in a land reform struggle. However, after leading the farmers to achieve victory in the land reform, the leading cadres of the two village party branches led the farmers onto two different paths.

Yang Yonglu Leads Laotougou Farmers on the
  Road to Common Prosperity

Laotougou has always been known as a place with barren land and poor people. All the land is hillside fallow land, and there are only eighteen households in the entire village. When people returned in the autumn of 1948, the mountains and fields were covered with weeds. Doors, windows, and furniture had been smashed and burned by the Yan Xishan bandits, and the courtyards were overgrown with weeds. At that time, the Laotougou Party branch, under the leadership of Yang Yonglu, led the villagers to start the arduous work of restoring production and rebuilding their homes on this wasteland.

After starting production, everything they needed was lacking. All they possessed were five donkeys, the clothes on their backs, and a small amount of rations. Faced with this difficulty, the general public often showed pessimism. Based on the instructions of the higher-level Party committee to "organize and develop production," Yang Yonglu promptly mobilized the villagers, explaining, "We were able to defeat the enemy, and we will certainly be able to overcome the difficulties in production." Under the leadership of the party members, the eighteen households formed three mutual aid teams to carry out production. At this time, Yang Yongxiang, a veteran who had been demobilized with honors, returned and exchanged the more than nine hundred jin of millet disability allowance he had brought back for two donkeys, which, together with the existing donkeys, formed three plowing teams. In addition, some people also organized to participate in pulling the plow to supplement the lack of animal power. The People's Government also timely distributed 1,000 jin of relief grain, 200 jin of various seeds, and more than 100 pieces of production tools to them. In order to ensure that these grains were actually used for production to get through the spring famine, Yang Yonglu organized each household to cook together and mobilized women to collect wild vegetables in the mountains, mixing them with grain to eat. In this way, they survived the spring famine of 1949 and cultivated 300 mu of wasteland. In the autumn, they harvested more than 200 dan of grain, basically solving the problem of food shortages and laying the foundation for expanding production.

In the following four years, the village continuously carried out mutual aid and cooperative production, reclaiming wasteland and increasing the land from 300 mu to the current 602 mu. The number of livestock increased from the original seven to sixteen, and 105 new sheep were added. Grain production has more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. By the winter of 1953, the food of the local farmers was mostly millet and noodles (oat or buckwheat noodles), almost everyone had two sets of cotton clothes and a set of bedding, and the cave dwellings of each family were whitewashed and furnished with various lacquered furniture. Farmer Pan Youcheng said to those who visited him: "When we first came back that year, we couldn't even eat our fill of sorghum dumplings during the New Year, let alone wear new clothes; in 1951, we managed to eat a meal of white flour dumplings during the New Year, and adults and children had new clothes to wear; by 1952, it was very different, the whole family slaughtered a pig, ate four or five meals of white flour dumplings, and everyone wore new clothes."

When local farmers talked about how they became prosperous, in addition to thanking the Communist Party and the People's Government for their leadership, they also praised the Party branch secretary Yang Yonglu for his leadership. For example, in 1951, when the lives of the families were not yet prosperous, the grandparents of mutual aid team member Yang Dunwa died one after another, spending a lot of money on medicine and burial. By the spring of the following year, Yang Dunwa's family had nothing to eat. Party branch secretary Yang Yonglu, fearing that he would sell his house and land and become impoverished, mobilized his uncles and brothers Yang Yongxiang and Yang Yongjin, who had surplus grain, to lend Yang Dunwa one dan and five dou of grain. When working, because Yang Dunwa's family had difficulty eating, Yang Yonglu sometimes called him to eat at his house. Yang Yonglu's spirit of actively leading the branch members, leading the farmers in production, and overcoming difficulties made the villagers trust the Communist Party and the People's Government even more. When the villagers saw cadres from higher levels, they often said, "Yonglu is a good cadre. Whatever he tells us to do, we do. There's no mistake in following him." When the eighteen households in the village formed an agricultural production cooperative in the spring of 1953, Yang Yonglu was honorably elected as the director by all the members.

When the government mobilized farmers to sell surplus grain to the state, the farmers of Laotougou, based on historical facts, deeply experienced the benefits of the state's unified control of grain. The eighteen households sold all of their 13,700 jin of surplus grain to the state in exchange for thirty-six cows and three donkeys. They also planned to calculate carefully and sell several thousand more jin of grain in exchange for several head of breeding livestock.

Zhao Guilan Leads Fanzhuang Farmers Down the Wrong Path

Fanzhuang is located at the foot of the Eastern Mountains, mostly flat, large fields, which are more convenient to cultivate. During the Liberation War, the damage done by the Yan Xishan bandits to Fanzhuang was not as severe as that to Laotougou. These conditions were superior to those of Laotougou. However, Party Branch Secretary Zhao Guilan did not use these conditions to lead the farmers in mutual aid and cooperation to develop production. Instead, he took the lead in taking a completely different path from Laotougou. After the implementation of land reform in the spring of 1949, Zhao Guilan received ten mu of good land. He disregarded the difficulties of the villagers in restoring production after receiving land, did not implement the instructions of the higher-level Party committee to "organize and develop production," and only wanted to live a good life himself. In addition to burying himself in his own agricultural production, he also fraudulently obtained loans from the bank and opened a grocery store, hiring workers to make mooncakes, but he did not make any money. In the end, he even went so far as to stretch out his shameful hand to embezzle the fruits of the farmers' land reform victory. Because he did not lead the farmers on the road to collective prosperity through organization, seven of the thirteen party members in the village bought and sold land and houses, one hired a hired laborer, and two became hired laborers, which had a very bad influence on the general farmers. Some farmers even said, "Stretch out your arms and spread your hands, however the party members go, that's how we go!" Of the 202 households in the village, more than 50 bought and sold houses and land, and four hired long-term laborers. Zhang Cunsheng and Li Sanhong, two old men, sold everything due to difficult living conditions and died of illness and starvation. The mutual aid team that the district committee led the establishment of in this village in 1952 was not only not well led by Zhao Guilan, but he even went into the team to sponge off the team members. The team stipulated that six jin of millet would be used for one day of livestock use during the slack season, and ten jin of millet would be used during the busy season. Zhao Guilan used other people's livestock, but calculated it at six jin of millet per day. Therefore, when organizing the mutual aid team in the spring of 1953, the team members said, "If Guilan joins the team, we'll disband; if Guilan leaves the team, we'll work!" Zhao Guilan was eager to get rich, but he was not lucky. He lost money doing business, and his wife was often sick. He had no choice but to become a hired laborer during the autumn harvest of 1953. Because he only cared about personal wealth and was divorced from the masses, he was also removed from his position as Party branch secretary.

Because the Fanzhuang Party branch did not lead the masses in production well, the farmers' understanding of the relationship between individuals and the state was very vague. The village had 190,000 jin of surplus grain, but only 6,000 jin was sold to the state. These 6,000 jin were also sold by farmers to the cooperative in exchange for consumer goods at a price of one and a half dou per sheng.

A Vivid Education

Yang Yonglu led the Laotougou farmers on the road to collective prosperity, and he also became prosperous. Zhao Guilan only cared about getting rich himself, but became impoverished. At the activists' meeting held in Laotougou Township on December 6, the two made a comparison of their living changes over the past four years. Yang Yonglu reported: "When I came back, the cave dwellings had no doors or windows, there was no mat on the kang (platform bed), and we couldn't even be sure of getting thin gruel for the next meal. In addition to the tattered clothes I was wearing, the six of us shared two tattered quilts." Then he said excitedly: "Now my cave dwellings not only have doors and windows, but also have glass installed, and everyone has two sets of single, cotton, and夹衣 (lined) clothes to change. We eat two meals of thick gruel and one meal of oat noodles every day." He also said, "My kang is covered with felt underneath, leather cushions on top, cloth cushions on top of that, and a printed flannel quilt on top of the cushion cover; in addition to cotton clothes, I also have a fur coat." "I also made two sets of uniforms for my two children and bought red underwear for my wife." After Yang Yonglu finished his report, everyone asked Zhao Guilan to report as well. At this time, Zhao Guilan said with shame, "I took the wrong path. I can't compare with him." In the end, Zhang Hongxi of Fanzhuang reported for him. He said, "Zhao Guilan took the wrong path, and as a result, his current life is very difficult. He only has a piece of mat that doesn't cover the kang board, and the two of them share a tattered felt, which was allocated during the land reform; the two of them share an old mattress, and each of them has a quilt with half a jin of cotton; the pig he raises in the pen weighs less than five jin; the house allocated during the land reform cannot be lived in because he can't afford to repair it, and he still lives in someone else's house." Zhang Hongxi, afraid that he had reported incorrectly, finally asked Zhao Guilan, "Is what I said correct?" Zhao Guilan quickly replied, "Yes! Yes! Absolutely correct!"

After learning the General Line, the party members and masses of the two villages also clearly understood that in order to avoid poverty and move towards collective prosperity, they must organize and develop production. The party members and masses of Laotougou are prepared to develop their agricultural production cooperative in an all-round way in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and to further improve their agricultural production cooperative. All the party members of Fanzhuang also clearly stated that they must establish the idea of ​​serving the people, and currently take the lead in educating the masses to sell surplus grain to the state, and take the lead in participating in mutual aid teams and strive to live a collectively prosperous life with everyone.

    走两条道路的两种结果
    赵宪斌　师春山
    在中共山西阳曲县委员会召开的活动分子会议上，根据党的总路线检查过去的农村工作时，有两个生动的例子教育了到会的每个党员。一个是中共老土沟村支部书记杨永禄，领导支部党员带动全村农民走上了党所提倡的组织起来的道路，从阎匪制造的“无人区”废墟上，恢复和发展了生产，使全村农民都富裕了。一九五三年春天成立农业生产合作社时，杨永禄被社员推选做社长。和老土沟农民富裕情况成鲜明对照的，是范庄支部书记赵贵兰，在土地改革后，没有好好领导支部的工作，只顾个人发财，不组织群众生产，结果该村农民内部发生很大分化，有的人贫困破产，有的人雇上了长工，赵贵兰没有发财，于去年秋天也给人家当了雇工。
      一个地方的两个村庄
    这两个村都在阳曲县的东山上，老土沟在山坡上，范庄在山脚下，相距不过八里地，去春划乡时，两个村还划在一个乡。
    在抗日战争和人民解放战争时期，这两个村庄都是对敌斗争最坚决的村庄，杨永禄和赵贵兰也是当地农民所共知的两条英雄好汉。在一九四七年秋季，蒋阎匪帮在这里安据点、发动反共反人民战争的时候，两个村的支部领导两村农民实行了坚壁清野，领导民兵和敌人展开了英勇的斗争，保卫群众胜利地完成了秋收。以后，他们发动青年参加了人民解放军，又领导着两村不屈的农民，暂时撤退到盂县老根据地，组织农民进行生产，胜利地渡过了人民解放战争最艰苦的岁月。
    一九四八年秋季，人民解放军拔除了阎匪据点，解放了这一带的地方后，两村退到后方生产的农民也随着胜利归来。冬季，当地党和人民政府领导农民进行了土地改革斗争。但是，在领导农民取得土地改革的胜利以后，两个村党支部的领导干部却领导农民走上了两条不同的道路。
    杨永禄领导老土沟农民走上
      共同富裕的道路
    老土沟，向来被人称为地瘠民贫的地方，土地全部是山坡轮荒地，全村只十八户人家。一九四八年秋季人们回来时，满山遍野长满了蒿草，门窗家具被阎匪砸碎烧毁，院落里荒草丛生，杂乱不堪。当时，老土沟党支部，在杨永禄领导下，便领导全村农民，在这一片废墟上开始了恢复生产重整家园的艰苦工作。
    开始生产后，所需用的东西，什么都缺，全部家当，只有五头毛驴、随身的衣着和一些为数不多的口粮。一般群众在这种困难面前，不时流露出悲观情绪。杨永禄根据当时上级党委提出的“组织起来，发展生产”的指示，及时向全村农民作了动员，说明：“我们能够战胜敌人，我们也就一定能够战胜生产中的困难。”在党员带动下，全村十八户组成了三个互助组进行生产。这时荣誉退伍军人杨永祥回来了，把带回的九百多斤残废金小米，变换成两头毛驴，连同原有毛驴组成三犋耕地；另外，有些人也组织起来，参加拉犁，以补助畜力的不足。人民政府又适时发给他们一千斤救济粮，二百斤各样种籽，和百余件生产工具。杨永禄为了把这些粮食确实用到生产上，渡过春荒，就组织各家合锅合灶，发动妇女到山上去采集野菜，掺着粮食一块吃。就这样渡过了一九四九年的春荒，耕种了三百亩荒地。到秋天，他们收了二百多石粮食，基本上解决了吃饭困难，奠定了扩大生产的基础。
    以后四年，该村连续进行互助合作生产，开垦荒地，使土地由三百亩增加到了现今的六百零二亩，牲口由原来的七头，增加到了十六头，新增加羊一百零五只，粮食的产量已超过了战前的一倍。到一九五三年冬季，当地农民的饭食，已都是吃的两米一面（莜面或荞面），差不多每人都有两套棉衣，一套被褥，各家的窑洞都粉刷得洁白，屋内摆设着各种油漆家具。农民潘友成对访问他的人说：“刚回来那一年过年时，不要说穿新衣，就是高粱面饺子还不敢吃饱；到一九五一年过年时，就凑合着吃上了一顿白面饺子，大人小孩也有的穿上了件新衣服；到一九五二年过年时，就大不同了，全家杀了一口猪，吃了四、五顿白面饺子，每人都穿上了新衣。”
    当地农民在谈到他们如何走上富裕道路的时候，除了感谢共产党和人民政府对他们的领导外，对党支部书记杨永禄对他们的领导，也赞扬备至。例如，在一九五一年，各家的生活还不富裕的时候，互助组员杨囤娃的祖父母患病相继死了，吃药、埋葬花钱很多，到第二年开春，杨囤娃家就没有吃的了。支部书记杨永禄怕他卖房卖地再贫困下去，就动员了自己有余粮的叔伯兄弟杨永祥、杨永金，借给了杨囤娃一石五斗粮食。在做活时，因杨囤娃家吃饭困难，杨永禄有时还把他叫到自己家里去吃。杨永禄这种积极领导支部党员，带动农民生产，克服困难的精神，使全村农民对共产党、人民政府更加信任了。该村农民见了上级去的干部常说：“永禄是个好干部，他叫做什咱做什，跟上他走没错。”一九五三年春天，全村十八户农民成立农业生产合作社时，杨永禄便被全体社员光荣地推选做社长。
    在政府动员农民把余粮卖给国家时，老土沟农民联系历史事实，深深体验到国家统一掌握粮食的好处。十八户把余粮一万三千七百斤全部卖给了国家，换回了三十六头母牛，三条驴；他们还准备再精打细算一下，再卖几千斤粮，换回几头母畜。
    赵贵兰领导范庄农民走错了路
    范庄座落在东山脚下，大部是平坦大块地，耕作起来比较方便。在解放战争中，阎匪对范庄的破坏也没有老土沟严重。这些条件都是比老土沟优越的地方。但是，支部书记赵贵兰没有利用这些条件来领导农民互助合作发展生产，他却自己带头，走了一条和老土沟截然不同的道路。一九四九年春实行土地改革后，赵贵兰分到了十亩好地。他不管全村农民分到土地后恢复生产中的困难，不执行上级党委“组织起来，发展生产”的指示，一味想自己过好日子。他除了只埋头于自己的农业生产外，又从银行骗取了贷款，开起了杂货铺，雇上工人做月饼，结果没有赚钱。最后，他竟然不惜伸出可耻的手，去贪污农民土地改革的胜利果实。因他不领导农民走组织起来的集体富裕的道路，全村十三个党员中，就有七个买卖土地房屋，一个雇上了雇工，两个当了雇工，对一般农民影响很坏。有些农民竟说：“伸开胳膀叉开手，党员怎走咱怎走！”全村二百零二户人家，就有五十余户买卖房屋土地，四户雇上了长工；张存生、李三红两个老汉，因生活困难，把一切卖光了，落到病饿而死。一九五二年区委在这村领导建立起的互助组，赵贵兰不但不去很好领导，反进到组里去揩组员们的油。组里规定农闲时用一天牲口六斤小米，农忙时十斤小米，赵贵兰用了人家的牲口，却一律按六斤米算。因此一九五三年春天组织互助组时，组员们说“贵兰入组咱们散，贵兰出组咱们干！”赵贵兰急于发财，可是偏不幸运，做买卖赔了钱，老婆经常生病，没办法，于一九五三年秋收时当了雇工。因为他只顾个人发财，脱离群众，党支部书记的职务也被撤销了。
    范庄党支部因为没有很好领导群众生产，农民对个人和国家的关系认识非常模糊。全村有十九万斤余粮，可是卖给国家的却只有六千斤。这六千斤也是农民以一升半斗向合作社换消费品卖出的。
    生动的教育
    杨永禄领导老土沟农民走集体富裕的道路，自己也富裕了。赵贵兰只顾自己发财，反倒贫困了。在十二月六日老土沟乡召开的积极分子会议上，两人作了四年来生活变化的对比。杨永禄报告说：“我回来时，窑洞没有门窗，炕上没铺的炕席，吃的稀粥还上顿赶不上下顿，除随身穿的一身破衣服外，六口人合盖着两条破被子。”紧接着他又兴奋地说：“现在我的窑洞不只有了门窗，还安上了玻璃，每人都有替换穿的两套单、棉、夹衣。每天吃的有两顿稠粥，一顿莜面。”他还说：“我的炕上底下铺的是毡子，上面是皮褥子，再上面是布褥子，布褥子上有褥单子，上面是盖的花哔叽被子；另外，我除了棉衣，还有皮袄”“我还给两个孩子做了两身制服，给老婆买了红卫生衣”“我回来时圈里是空的，现在圈里有母牛三头，毛驴一条，羊十只，一百多斤重的猪有两口，另外还养着几窝蜜蜂……。”待杨永禄报告完后，大家要求赵贵兰也报告一下。这时赵贵兰羞惭地说：“我走错了路，我比不上人家。”最后还是范庄张洪喜替他报告了一遍，他说：“赵贵兰走错了路，结果自己现在的生活十分困苦。他只有盖不住炕板的一块席子，两口子伙铺着一块破毡子，还是土地改革时分下的；两人铺着一条旧褥子，每人盖着一条半斤棉花的被子；他圈里喂着一口猪还不过五斤重；土地改革时分下的房子，因整修不起，不能住，现在还是借的人家的房子住着。”张洪喜恐怕给他报告错了，最后还问赵贵兰“说得对不对？”赵贵兰连忙答复说：“对！对！一点不错！”
    两村的党员和群众，在学习总路线时，经过这样对比之后，也清楚地了解到要想避免贫困，走向集体富裕，就必须组织起来发展生产。老土沟的党员和群众，准备要使自己的农业生产合作社向农、林、牧全面发展，进一步办好自己的农业生产合作社。范庄的全体党员也明确表示：要树立为人民服务的思想，当前首先带头教育群众把余粮卖给国家，并带头参加互助组，和大家一起争取过集体富裕的生活。
