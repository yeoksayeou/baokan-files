Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 22nd. (Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports): On the timeline of the US side delaying the convening of the political conference, the date of January 22nd has been crossed out along with the realization of the forced retention of prisoners of war. However, there is still no sign of the resumption of bilateral talks on the political conference issue.

Since January 14th, the bilateral liaison secretaries' meeting has been held four times. The Korean-Chinese side has proposed three dates for resuming the talks, but all have been rejected by the US side. The delaying tactic used by the US side is to demand revisions to the meeting minutes.

It is known that in previous bilateral talks, US representative Dean had said countless "irrelevant, unrelated, unacceptable, obstructive, and destructive" things, causing the political conference to be delayed for months and unable to be convened. Now, the US side is demanding that these words be brought up again for endless discussion, euphemistically calling it "revising the meeting minutes." People really don't know how far the US side intends to drag things out.

The US side's use of revising the meeting minutes as a condition for resuming bilateral talks shows that it is unwilling to resume bilateral talks at all. The US side first delayed the convening of the political conference in the bilateral talks, then delayed the bilateral talks in the liaison secretaries' meeting, and now is delaying the liaison secretaries' meeting by demanding revisions to the meeting minutes. The political conference that the people of the world are eager to see convened is being dragged out indefinitely by the US side. Many signs indicate that what the Washington authorities are concerned about now is not so much the rapid convening of the political conference as it is dragging this issue into a state of suspended animation. Some reports even say that the US authorities do not want to convene a political conference at all. US International News Service reporter Stone reported in an internal briefing on the 21st that senior diplomatic and military leaders of the so-called United Nations forces in the Far East "privately agreed" that after the US forced retention of prisoners of war, the hope of resuming bilateral talks was "dashed." They believe that the Korean problem "will be one of the problems in the world that will never be solved." Stone said that UN Commander Hull believes that "the current ceasefire line will become a peace line without true peace, and the armistice document signed on July 27 will be the last official document between the opposing sides." Stone's report cannot but arouse serious attention and vigilance throughout the world.

### 双方联络秘书会议因美方拖延毫无结果  迹象表明美方要把政治会议拖得遥遥无期

    双方联络秘书会议因美方拖延毫无结果
    迹象表明美方要把政治会议拖得遥遥无期
   【新华社开城二十二日电】本社特派记者江南报道：在美方拖延政治会议召开的时间表上，一月二十二日这个日期已经随着强迫扣留战俘的实现而被划掉了，但是关于政治会议问题的双方会谈还没有恢复的迹象。
    双方联络秘书会议从一月十四日以来已经举行了四次。朝中方面已经提出了三个恢复会谈的日期，但是都遭到了美方的拒绝。美方所使用的拖延策略，就是要求修改会议记录。
    人们知道，在以往的双方会谈中，美方代表迪安已说了数不清的“题外的、不相干的、不能接受的、障碍性的、破坏性的”话，使政治会议拖延了几个月而不能召开。现在，美方又要求把这些话重新拿出来谈个不休，美其名曰“修改会议记录”，人们真不知美方拖延伊于胡底。
    美方以修改会议记录作为恢复双方会谈的条件，骨子里是不愿恢复双方会谈。美方起先把政治会议的召开拖在双方会谈中，接着又把双方会谈拖在联络秘书会议中，现在又把联络秘书会议拖在要求修改会议记录中，世界人民渴望召开的政治会议被美方拖得遥遥无期了。许多迹象表明，华盛顿当局现在关心的与其说是迅速召开政治会议问题，倒不如说是把这个问题拖得半死不活。有些消息甚至说，美国当局压根儿不想召开政治会议了。美国国际新闻社的记者斯通在二十一日的一份内部通报中报道说，在远东的所谓联合国军的高级外交人员和军事领袖，“私下一致认为”，在美方强迫扣留战俘以后，恢复双方会谈的希望是“破灭了”。他们认为，朝鲜问题“将是世界上永远得不到解决的问题中的一个”。斯通说，联合国军司令赫尔认为，“目前这条停战线将成为一条没有真正和平的和平线，在七月二十七日签订的停战文件将是敌对双方之间的最后一份正式文件。”斯通的报道不得不引起全世界的严重注意和警惕。
