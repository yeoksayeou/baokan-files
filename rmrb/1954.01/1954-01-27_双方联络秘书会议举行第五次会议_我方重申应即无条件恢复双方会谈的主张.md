Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 26th: The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the talks on the political conference issue issued the following communique: The fifth meeting of the Liaison Secretaries of both sides was held on January 26th.

Due to the US side's unwillingness to immediately resume the talks and its persistent, unreasonable insistence on amending past meeting records as a condition for resuming the meeting, repeatedly refusing to agree with our side on a date for the meeting, the Liaison Secretaries' meeting has made no progress since it convened on January 14th. In view of this, our side's representative specifically sent a letter (see separate telegram) to the US representative Dean at today's Liaison Secretaries' meeting, directly raising this issue to seek a solution, and once again suggested that the talks between the two sides resume on February 1st, requesting a reply from the US side. When delivering the letter, our secretary stated: If the other side is willing to propose a specific date for resuming the meeting today, our side is willing to listen; otherwise, our side suggests that the Liaison Secretaries' meeting be adjourned to await a response from the other side's representative.

However, the US secretary still insisted on its unreasonable demand that resuming the meeting must be conditional, continued to refuse to agree with our side on a date for resuming the meeting, and groundlessly accused our side of delaying.

Our secretary immediately refuted this, pointing out that the facts prove that the responsibility for the delay lies entirely with the other side, and solemnly reiterated our side's position: First, the talks between the two sides should resume unconditionally. Since the interruption of the talks between the two sides was originally unwarranted, its resumption should not be conditional. The other side's claim that the conditions for resumption should be negotiated before the resumption is only intentionally creating artificial obstacles. Second, the talks between the two sides should resume immediately. Our side cannot agree to the other side's claim that the past meeting records must be amended before the resumption, because the most important thing at present is to reopen the talks between the two sides, not to repeat past disputes, and since amending the past meeting records is unnecessary, our side is not prepared to do so. Third, our side believes that resuming the talks between the two sides and conducting sincere consultations will have a positive effect on peace in Korea. Our side cannot agree to the other side's claim that a "basis" for the talks between the two sides must be sought before the resumption. The basis for the talks between the two sides was destroyed by the other side's unilateral interruption of the meeting, and now only the other side expressing its sincerity in agreeing to an immediate resumption of the meeting can provide the necessary basis for the talks between the two sides. In short, our side has always advocated setting aside past disputes and immediately resuming the talks between the two sides, which is the only fair, reasonable, and feasible solution. Now the issue of resumption has been raised by our representative in a letter to the other side's representative to seek a solution. Before the other side's representative replies, it is meaningless for the Liaison Secretaries of both sides to continue the discussion. Our side suggests adjourning the meeting to await the other side's reply. The US secretary agreed to the adjournment.

　　双方联络秘书会议举行第五次会议
　　我方重申应即无条件恢复双方会谈的主张
    【新华社开城二十六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：一月二十六日双方联络秘书会议举行第五次会议。
    由于美方无意立即恢复双方会谈，始终无理地主张以修改过去会议记录为复会的条件，而一再拒绝与我方商定开会日期，以致双方联络秘书会议自一月十四日开会以来迄今毫无进展。我方代表有鉴于此，特于今日联络秘书会议上，致函（见另电）美方代表迪安直接提出这个问题，以寻求解决，并再一次建议双方会谈于二月一日复会，要求美方答复。我方秘书于递交该函时，曾表示：如果对方今天愿意提出具体的复会日期，我方愿意听取，否则我方建议双方联络秘书会议休会，以等待对方代表的答复。
    但美方秘书仍坚持其复会必须有条件的无理主张，继续拒绝与我方商定复会日期，且毫无根据地反指我方拖延。
    我方秘书当即加以驳斥，指出事实证明拖延的责任全在对方，同时并郑重地重申我方的主张：第一、双方会谈应该无条件恢复，既然双方会谈的中断本来就是不应该的，它的恢复也就不应该有条件，对方所谓复会前应先谈判复会条件的主张，只是有意在制造人为的障碍。第二、双方会谈应该立即恢复，我方不能同意对方所谓在复会前必须先修改过去会议记录的主张，因为目前最重要的是重开双方会谈，而不是去重复过去的争论，而且修改过去会议记录既无必要，我方不准备这样做。第三、我方认为双方恢复会谈并进行诚意协商就将对朝鲜和平产生积极的作用，我方不能同意对方所谓在复会前必须为双方会谈寻求什么“基础”的主张，双方会谈的基础是由于对方片面中断会议而被破坏的，现在只有对方表示同意立即复会的诚意，才能使双方会谈获得必要的基础。总而言之，我方一直主张撇开过去的争论，立即恢复双方会谈，这是唯一公平合理、切实可行的办法。现在复会的问题已由我方代表致函对方代表寻求解决，在对方代表答复以前，双方联络秘书继续进行讨论并无意义，我方建议休会以等待对方的答复，美方秘书同意休会。
