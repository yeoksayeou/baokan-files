Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th: The "Daily Herald" published an article commenting on the American economic crisis and its impact on Britain and other capitalist countries.

The newspaper wrote: "In December, (American) steel production was reduced by one-third compared to the previous year. Major automobile companies cut production by 10 percent. The number of unemployed has doubled... For more than two years, the income of 25 million American farmers has been declining. When the Korean War started, crop prices were once very high, but later they declined day by day." The newspaper pointed out: It is expected that housing construction this year will be drastically reduced. The newspaper said: "The 'downward trend' has begun. People are becoming increasingly worried."

The newspaper pointed out that the deepening of the American economic crisis will lead to a sharp reduction in American purchases of raw materials. The newspaper said: "We and other sterling countries will feel this impact the most, because we mainly rely on selling raw materials such as wool, rubber, tin, jute, and cocoa to earn US dollars. Some experts say that based on past 'recessions' in the United States, a reduction of only 3 or 4 percent in US production will reduce our dollar income by 20 percent, or even 30 percent. According to the current situation, our dollar income is not sufficient. Such a large reduction in dollar income will have a very serious impact on Britain."
Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The increasingly obvious economic recession in the United States has aroused the fear of the Japanese bourgeoisie. Because the Japanese economy has been reduced to a dependency of American monopoly capital, they are worried that the American economic recession will severely hit Japan.

Kunio Horie, managing director of the Bank of Tokyo, recently wrote an article in the "Mainichi Shimbun" newspaper, discussing the American economic recession and its impact on Japan. Horie said: Judging from the nature of the Republican government, it is believed that a recession will inevitably occur in the United States. In this case, the United States will first protect itself. He predicted that the American economic recession will have a very serious and extensive impact on other capitalist countries, and Japan will be affected twice as much as the United States. He warned that due to the impact of the American economic recession, Japan's exports to the United States and the sterling area will decrease.

Kyodo News Agency, December 31, 1953, in talking about Japan's bleak economic prospects for 1954, also said: "There is a strong view that next year will not only be affected by (Japan's) 1954 budget, but also by a depression in the United States, and Japan, which is affected by the American depression... will be swept into a whirlpool of depression."

    担心美国经济危机引起的严重影响
    英日资产阶级报刊对经济前途很是不安
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社伦敦七日讯：“每日先驱报”刊载了一篇文章，评论美国的经济危机与它对英国及其他资本主义国家的影响。
    该报写道：“十二月份（美国）的钢铁生产比前一年减少了三分之一。大汽车公司把生产削减了百分之十。失业人数增加了一倍……两年多以来，美国二千五百万农民的收入一直在减少。在朝鲜战争开始时，农作物价格一度很高，但是后来便日益下降。”该报指出：预料今年的房屋修建将剧烈减少。该报说：“‘走下坡路的趋势’已经开始。人们越来越感到忧虑。”
    该报指出：美国经济危机的加深将使美国对原料的购买锐减，该报说：“我们和其他英镑国家将最能感觉到这种影响，因为我们主要是靠出卖羊毛、橡胶、锡、黄麻、可可等原料来赚取美元的。有一些专家说，根据美国过去历次‘衰退’的经验，美国生产只要削减百分之三或百分之四，便会使得我们的美元收入减少百分之二十，甚至百分之三十。按照目前情况，我们的美元收入并不足够。美元收入减少这样多将对英国有非常严重的影响。”
   【新华社九日讯】东京消息：美国日益明显的经济衰退现象已引起日本资产阶级的恐惧。由于日本经济已沦为美国垄断资本的附庸，他们担心美国的经济衰退会使日本受到严重的打击。
    东京银行常务董事堀江薰雄最近在“每日新闻”报上撰文，谈到美国的经济衰退问题和它将对日本发生的影响。堀江说：从共和党政府的性质来判断，相信美国必然要发生衰退。在这种情况下，美国将首先保护自身。他预料：美国的经济衰退将对其他资本主义国家产生很严重和广泛的影响，而日本所受的影响将两倍于美国所受的影响。他警告说：由于美国经济衰退的影响，日本对美国和英镑区的出口都将减少。
    共同社一九五三年十二月三十一日电在谈到一九五四年日本暗淡的经济前景时也说：“有这样一种强有力的看法，认为明年不仅有（日本的）一九五四年度预算的影响，并且在美国也要发生不景气，而蒙受美国不景气影响的日本……会被卷进不景气的漩涡中去。”
