(Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 4th) According to a report in "Rudé právo": Czechoslovak Republic President Antonín Zápotocký delivered a New Year's broadcast speech to the nation on the 1st.

In his speech, Zápotocký described the situation in recent years of the Republic's struggle against domestic and foreign reactionary forces sabotaging peaceful construction activities. He pointed out that the Czechoslovak people have overcome the enemy's conspiracies and defended peace in recent years, and successfully completed the Five-Year Plan (1949-1953). These were the two great achievements they had obtained. Zápotocký emphasized: The past five years were not easy years to achieve success. We encountered various difficulties and obstacles, and conspiracies and sabotage by enemies at home and abroad, but thanks to the invincible will and enthusiasm of the vast majority of urban and rural working people in our country, we overcame all obstacles. During these five years, we experienced historical revolutionary changes. According to preliminary estimates, industrial production in 1953 more than doubled that of 1948, and increased by 1.25 times compared to 1937 before the war. The achievements in the Slovak region are particularly gratifying. In 1953, its industrial output was nearly three and a half times that of 1937. This created an economic foundation for strengthening the fraternal ties between the Czech and Slovak nations. In industry, by the end of the Five-Year Plan, the remnants of capitalist elements had been virtually eliminated. Due to the strong development of industry, we have created a solid material foundation for realizing the transformation of the entire economy, establishing a consolidated national defense force, and providing effective assistance to the socialist construction of countries in the peace camp. The original Five-Year Plan put forward in 1948 was not only completed but exceeded by a quarter. The preliminary results of the implementation of the plan enabled us to raise the targets of the original Five-Year Plan in 1951, and we almost completed 99 percent of these raised targets. Zápotocký said: The achievements we have obtained so far tell us that we have enough strength, ability, and possibilities to eliminate all mistakes and overcome difficulties, ensure socialist construction, and thus ensure the establishment of a happy life for our people.

When talking about agricultural achievements, Zápotocký said that because the living standards of our people are constantly improving, they naturally and continuously increase their demand for food. However, because agricultural production lags far behind the development of industrial production, this has caused difficulties in food supply. Therefore, it is necessary to increase grain production and develop animal husbandry, and it is necessary to continue to steadily develop unified agricultural cooperatives under the principle of voluntariness.

After describing the elimination of unemployment and the implementation of currency reform and two price reductions in 1953, Zápotocký pointed out: We have created a solid foundation for correct price and wage policies and for continuously improving the living standards of the working people by reducing prices. In the past five years, our investment in the national economy reached 97 billion crowns (Czech currency), of which industrial investment accounted for 45 billion crowns. These investments were obtained from our own resources and our own labor, not from loans from foreign capitalists. Therefore, we can implement our own policies without succumbing to foreign capitalists. The elections of the People's Committees to be held in 1954 will strengthen our people's democratic system and enable us to absorb the broad masses of the people to participate in solving all problems of socialist construction.

Zápotocký finally expressed his support for the Soviet government's recent proposal on reaching an agreement among the great powers and unconditionally prohibiting the use of atomic weapons to ease international tensions. He said that we will not relax our efforts in construction. We will further develop production, increase labor productivity, and continuously improve the living standards of our people. In the new year, we will rely on our best friend—the Soviet Union, strengthen ties with the world peace movement and all good people in a consolidated alliance with all people's democratic countries, and continue to carry out our socialist construction.

    捷总统萨波托斯基向人民发表新年演说
    庆贺全国人民在五年计划中取得的成就
    【新华社布拉格四日电】据“红色权利报”报道：捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统萨波托斯基于一日向全国人民发表了新年广播演说。
    萨波托斯基在演说中叙述了几年来共和国同国内外反动派破坏国内和平建设活动作斗争的情形。他指出，捷克斯洛伐克人民几年来战胜了敌人的阴谋，保卫住了和平，并胜利地结束了五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年），这是他们所获得的两个伟大的成就。萨波托斯基强调说：过去的五年并不是容易获得成就的五年。我们遇到过各种困难和障碍，遇到过国内外敌人的阴谋破坏，但是由于我国绝大多数的城乡劳动人民具有不可战胜的意志和热情，我们克服了一切障碍。在这五年里，我们经历了历史性的革命变化。据初步估计，一九五三年的工业生产比一九四八年增加了一倍以上，比战前一九三七年增加了一点二五倍。斯洛伐克地区在这方面的成就特别令人满意。一九五三年它的工业产量将近为一九三七年的三倍半。这样就给捷克和斯洛伐克两个民族的兄弟联系的加强创造了经济基础。在工业方面，到五年计划结束时，资本主义成分的残余已实际上被消除了。由于工业的强大发展，我们已为实现整个经济的改造、建立巩固的国防力量和给予和平阵营各国的社会主义建设以有效援助，创造了巩固的物质基础。一九四八年提出的原来的五年计划，不仅完成了而且被超过了四分之一。执行计划的初步结果，使我们在一九五一年把原来的五年计划的目标提高了，即使这些提高了的目标，我们也几乎完成了百分之九十九。萨波托斯基说：至今我们所获得的成就告诉我们，我们有足够的力量、能力和可能性来消除一切错误并克服困难，保证社会主义建设，从而保证我国人民幸福生活的建立。
    萨波托斯基在谈到农业方面的成就时说，我国人民由于生活水平的不断提高，就自然而然地不断增加他们对粮食的需要。但是由于农业生产大大落后于工业生产的发展，这就造成了粮食供应的困难。因此必须提高谷物生产和发展饲畜业，必须继续在自愿的原则下稳步发展统一农业合作社。
    萨波托斯基在叙述消灭了失业现象、在一九五三年中实行了币制改革和两次减低物价之后指出：我们已为正确的物价和工资政策，为以减低物价来不断提高劳动人民的生活水平创造了坚固的基础。在过去五年中，我们对国民经济的投资达九百七十亿克朗（捷币名），其中工业投资占四百五十亿克朗。这些投资是从我们自己的资源和自己的劳动中获得，而不是从外国资本家的贷款中获得的。因此，我们可以执行自己的政策而不屈从于外国资本家。一九五四年将要举行的人民委员会的选举，将加强我们的人民民主制度，使我们有可能吸收广大的人民群众来参加解决社会主义建设的一切问题。
    萨波托斯基最后表示支持苏联政府最近关于达成大国协议、无条件禁止使用原子武器以缓和国际紧张局势的建议。他说，我们将不松懈我们在建设上的努力。我们将进一步发展生产，提高劳动生产率，不断提高我国人民的生活水平。在新的一年里，我们将依靠我们最好的朋友——苏联，在与一切人民民主国家的巩固联盟下，加强与世界和平运动及一切善良人民的联系，继续进行我国的社会主义建设。
