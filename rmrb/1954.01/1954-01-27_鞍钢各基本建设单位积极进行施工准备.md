　　Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Basic Construction Units Actively Prepare for Construction
　　The various business offices and engineering companies of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' basic construction projects are stepping up preparations for this year's basic construction.
　　Anshan Iron and Steel Works has more than a dozen key projects for new construction and reconstruction this year. These construction projects are all key projects of the country's first Five-Year Plan. The projects scheduled to be completed this year include the thin plate plant, the No. 6 blast furnace, and 350,000 square meters of dormitories.
　　To ensure the smooth construction of the projects according to plan, all units are stepping up a series of preparations. The design projects for the key construction projects this year have been completed or are being rushed to completion. In terms of construction preparation, thanks to the accumulation of more than a year of construction experience, all preparations are arranged in an orderly manner. At the end of last year, the planning department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company organized various engineering companies to preliminarily allocate construction tasks, inspected the construction conditions at the construction sites, and repeatedly balanced the construction forces. Currently, various engineering companies are stepping up the preparation of this year's construction technology and financial plans. When preparing the plan, each engineering company has made some specific technical measures to ensure that the construction and installation costs are reduced by 10% and labor productivity is increased by 17% this year.
　　In terms of material preparation, most of the building materials for the first quarter have been prepared. Looking at the total amount of materials for the whole year, 65% of steel, 50% of timber, and 27.2% of red bricks have been stored. Now, groups of horse-drawn carts and cars are rushing to transport the red bricks and gravel needed for the first quarter.
　　The equipment needed for construction in the first quarter of this year, except for some electrical equipment and instruments, has been transported from various places at home and abroad to Anshan. Most of the machinery and equipment for the steelmaking, beneficiation, and refractory engineering systems have arrived.

　　鞍钢各基本建设单位积极进行施工准备
    鞍钢基本建设各业务处和各工程公司，正加紧进行今年基本建设的各项准备工作。
    鞍钢今年新建和改建的重点工程有十几项。这些建设工程都是国家第一个五年计划的重点工程。计划今年内竣工的有薄板厂、六号炼铁炉和三十五万平方公尺宿舍等项工程。
    为了保证建设工程按计划顺利施工，各单位正在加紧进行一系列的准备工作。今年施工的重点工程的设计项目，有的已经完成，有的正在加紧赶制。在施工准备工作方面，由于积累了一年多的建设经验，各项准备工作都安排得井然有序。鞍山钢铁公司计划处在去年末就组织各工程公司初步分配了施工任务，并到工地勘察施工条件，反复平衡了施工力量。目前各工程公司正在加紧编制今年的施工技术、财务计划。在编制计划时，各工程公司都作了一些具体技术措施，保证降低今年建筑安装成本百分之十，提高劳动生产率百分之十七。
    在材料准备工作方面，第一季度的建筑材料已大部准备齐全。从全年的材料量来看，目前已储备了钢材百分之六十五、木材百分之五十、红砖百分之二十七点二。现在成群的马车、汽车正在赶运第一季度需要的红砖和碎石。
    今年第一季度施工所需要的设备，除部分电气设备、计器等外，已从国内外各地运到鞍山。炼钢、选矿、耐火工程系统的机器设备，已大部到齐。
