“May First” Collective Farm All Members Write to Farmers Across the Country
Reporting the Benefits of Organized Collective Production
Dear farmer brothers across the country:
	We are the members of the "May First" Collective Farm. As we enter the new year of 1954, which is also the beginning of the second year of our country's first five-year plan, we extend our cordial greetings to you.
	Our farm is located in Chengde County, Rehe Province, and was directly organized by individual farmers on May 1, 1952. The entire farm has 224 households, 1,040 people, and cultivates 2,100 mu of land, half of which is mountainous. In the past two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, due to the organization bringing into play the enthusiasm for labor, we have driven away poverty and are moving towards prosperity. Before the establishment of the farm, we all cultivated small plots of land using old methods, working from dawn to dusk all year round, and no household had enough to eat. In case of natural disasters and diseases, it was even more difficult. After organizing, we improved our farming techniques and increased our labor efficiency, and we achieved a bumper harvest in the first year. The average income per member was 1,000 jin of unprocessed grain, and the average income per household was 4,500 jin, which was several times higher than in the past. Although there were some natural disasters in 1953, we still harvested more grain than the previous year. After deducting public welfare funds, accumulation funds, and the payment of public grain, the average income per person was 1,250 jin of unprocessed grain, and the average income per household was 5,800 jin. Under the influence of the above facts, those who originally did not believe that organization had benefits now believe it, and farmers who were unwilling to join the farm are now asking to join.
	Farmer brothers: Let us tell you some more of the many benefits of organizing production. The first is that organization allows for a more detailed division of labor, where each person does what they can do, and receives as much remuneration as the amount of labor they put in, so everyone benefits. For example, Wang Shulai of our cooperative is good at field work, so he joined the field team for cultivation. This year, he worked 405 workdays and earned 6,075 jin of unprocessed grain. Chen, an old woman in her sixties, and Meng Guixia, a thirteen-year-old girl, also worked one hundred and several tens of workdays in the cotton field team, earning more than 2,000 jin of unprocessed grain. Secondly, due to the opening of land boundaries, the land is connected into large plots, and machines can be used for cultivation. We started using tractors to plow the land in the autumn of 1952. It was truly plowed quickly and deeply, and one day we could plow 60 mu of land, which is equivalent to 80 oxen and 40 laborers. Therefore, we freed up 80 laborers to burn more than 3 million bricks and more than 800,000 jin of lime to support national capital construction. Another benefit of organizing is that collective labor seeks welfare for everyone, and even widowed, orphaned, and disabled households who have lost their ability to work are properly settled. For example, Zhang Qingchen, a blind man who had been begging for more than 20 years before liberation, Dong Guizhi, a widow with four children, and Du Haichun, a single man in his sixties, and seven or eight other households, have all been assigned appropriate jobs and received welfare benefits from the farm, and every family has food and clothing. Our farm also has a credit department and a consumer cooperative. Members can borrow money from the credit department if they have difficulties, and buy things from the consumer cooperative, so they are no longer exploited by private merchants and usurers. After receiving collectivist education, the members have developed the virtue of cherishing public property. Thanks to the good management of the shepherd, the number of sheep on the farm has increased from more than 200 to more than 500 in just over a year. Facts have proved that the saying that "too many people with divided minds cannot produce well" is wrong.
	Farmer brothers: The benefits of organizing are endless. This is due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the help of our working-class brothers is also significant. They have supplied us with a lot of machinery, pesticides, and daily necessities. After studying the general line, we have sold 110,000 jin of grain to the state, and we are now actively engaged in winter production to strive for more grain next year to support national industrial construction. Brothers! To do a good job in production, produce more grain, and live a happy socialist life sooner, there is only one way: to take the road of organization. We wish you all a happy new year and hope that you will actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
	All Members of the “May First” Collective Farm

### “五一”集体农庄全体庄员写信给全国农民  报告组织起来进行集体生产的好处

    “五一”集体农庄全体庄员写信给全国农民
    报告组织起来进行集体生产的好处
    亲爱的全国农民兄弟们：
    我们是“五一”集体农庄的庄员，在这一九五四年新年到来的时候，也就是我们国家第一个五年建设计划第二年开始的时候，特向你们致以亲切的祝贺。
    我们的农庄在热河省承德县，是一九五二年五月一日由个体农民直接组织起来的。全农庄二百二十四户，一千零四十口人，耕种着两千一百亩土地，其中有一半是山地。两年来，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，由于组织起来发挥了劳动积极性，我们已经赶走了贫困，走向富裕。建庄前我们都是在小块土地上用老办法耕种，起早带晚地终年劳动，也没有一户够吃的。如遇天灾疾病，那就更加困难。组织起来以后，改良了耕作技术，提高了劳动效率，第一年便获得丰收。庄员每人平均收入原粮一千斤，每户平均收入四千五百斤，比过去增加了几倍。一九五三年虽然有些天灾，我们比前一年还是多打了粮食。除去公益金、公积金和缴纳公粮外，每人平均收入一千二百五十斤原粮，每户平均五千八百斤。在以上事实的影响下，原来不相信组织起来有好处的人现在相信了，不愿意参加农庄的农民现在也纷纷要求参加。
    农民兄弟们：我们再告诉你们一些组织起来进行生产的许多好处。首先是组织起来可以比较详细地分工分业，各人能做什么就做什么，出多少劳力就得到多少报酬，大家都不吃亏。比如我们社王树来的大田活计好，他就参加大田队耕作，今年做了四百零五个劳动日，收入六千零七十五斤原粮。六十多岁的陈老大娘和十三岁的孟桂霞小姑娘，在棉田队里也都做了一百几十个劳动日，收入了两千多斤原粮。其次，由于打开地界，土地连成大片，可以使用机器耕作。我们从一九五二年秋天开始用拖拉机翻地，真是耕得又快又深，一天能翻六十亩地，抵得上八十条牛和四十个劳动力。因此，我们腾出了八十个劳动力，烧出三百多万块砖、八十多万斤石灰，支持了国家基本建设。组织起来的再一个好处是集体劳动为大家谋福利，就是失去劳动力的鳏寡残废户也一样有了安置。如在解放前要了二十多年饭的瞎子张庆臣、带有四个小孩的寡妇董桂芝、六十多岁的独身汉杜海春等七、八户，都分配了适当的工作并受到了农庄的福利待遇，家家有吃有穿。我们农庄里还有信贷部和消费合作社，庄员有困难可以到信贷部借钱，要东西就到消费合作社去买，再也不受私商和高利贷者的剥削了。庄员们受到集体主义教育以后，已养成了爱护公共财产的美德。由于牧童经管得好，农庄里的羊，在一年多的时间内就由二百多只繁殖到五百多只。事实证明，“人多心不齐、搞不好生产”的说法是不对头了。
    农民兄弟们：组织起来的好处是说不尽的。这都是由于共产党和毛主席的正确领导，同时工人老大哥对我们的帮助也不小，他们供给了我们很多的机械、农药和日用品。我们在学习总路线以后，已把十一万斤粮食卖给国家，现在正积极进行冬季生产，争取明年收更多的粮食，支持国家工业建设。兄弟们！要搞好生产，多打粮食，早过社会主义的幸福生活，就只有走组织起来的道路。我们祝贺大家新年快乐，希望大家积极地参加互助合作运动。
    “五一”集体农庄全体庄员
