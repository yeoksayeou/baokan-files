Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, January 23rd:

    More than 200,000 workers and laborers on the Huai River harnessing construction sites are intensifying winter construction, and the progress of various projects is relatively smooth. The Foziling Reservoir in the middle reaches of the Huai River has adopted the Soviet advanced "winter operation method" in its winter construction. The main projects in December last year all overfulfilled their tasks. Concrete work overfulfilled by 13 percent, grouting work overfulfilled by 12 percent, and earth and stone work for clearing the foundation overfulfilled by 47 percent. The poured concrete also meets the engineering standards. The west half of the arch dam on the Pi River, including the dam piers and part of the dam arches, has now been poured to the top. The earthwork for the dam of the Boshan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Huai River is currently being carried out intensely. The eastern section of the dam has been built to an elevation of 72.8 meters, and the western section has been built to an elevation of 41.8 meters. Various workers on the Boshan Reservoir aqueduct are continuing to carry out unfinished work; the concrete work team improved the material transportation method, completing the original plan that required 36 hours of work in 17 hours. Since the start of winter construction, the Nanwan Reservoir has completed more than 10,000 cubic meters of earthwork, in addition to completing more than 40,000 cubic meters of material preparation for sand, more than 6,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and the laying of more than 4,000 meters of light rail. The winter construction plans for the North Fei River drainage and irrigation project and the Quan River regulation project in Anhui Province are also nearing completion after more than a month of intensive work.
    The workers and laborers participating in winter construction have overcome numerous difficulties in the severe cold weather and maintained the progress of the engineering plan. The Foziling Reservoir construction site is located in the mountains of the Dabie Mountains, where the climate is colder than outside the mountains, but the workers, whether it is in the morning with a biting north wind or in the late night with frost everywhere, still climb on the tens of meters high arch dam and work day and night, and improve work efficiency. In order to rush the transportation of equipment and materials, the workers of the automobile squadron of the Second Mechanical Brigade of the Nanwan Reservoir put forward the slogan of "not wasting a minute." Sometimes, they could not catch up with meals, so they stuffed buns in their pockets and took them to the car to eat. Within a distance of 390 li, the workers of the automobile squadron used 12 cars to transport more than 800 tons of equipment and materials in five days, overfulfilling the task.
    [Another Dispatch] The diversion project of tributaries in the middle reaches of the Huai River, which has the largest amount of earthwork in the Huai River harnessing project, had completed 90 percent of the entire engineering plan by the end of 1953. The main parts of the project, such as the dredging of the Chong River and Tong River, the cutting of the Fengshan Ridge and Xiacaowan Ridge, and the excavation of the Bogang Diversion River, have been successfully completed or are nearing completion. At present, the entire project has entered the final construction stage, continuing to excavate the Bogang Diversion River and block the tributaries entering the Huai River. Before the flood season this year, the diversion project of tributaries can be completed.

    治淮各项工程冬季施工加紧进行
    淮河中游干支流分流工程进入最后阶段
    【新华社蚌埠二十三日电】治淮工地上的二十多万工人和民工正加紧冬季施工，各项工程进度都较顺利。淮河中游的佛子岭水库在冬季施工中采用了苏联先进的“冬季作业法”，去年十二月份的主要工程都超额完成了任务，混凝土工程超额百分之十三，灌浆工作超额百分之十二，清基的土工和石工超额百分之四十七。浇筑的混凝土也都合于工程标准。现在建筑在淠河上的连拱坝西半部的坝垛和部分坝拱，已经浇筑到顶。淮河上游的薄山水库现正紧张进行拦河坝的上土工作。坝的东段已筑到七十二点八公尺高程，西段已筑到四十一点八公尺高程。薄山水库输水道上的各种工人，仍在继续进行未完成的工作；混凝土工作队改进了运料法，十七个小时就完成了原计划需要三十六个小时的工作。南湾水库自冬季施工以来，已完成土工一万多公方，另外还完成备料的沙方四万多公方，土工六千多公方，铺设轻便铁道四千多公尺。安徽省的北淝河排涝灌溉工程，泉河整理工程等，经过一个多月的赶工，冬季施工计划也都接近完成。
    参加冬季施工的工人和民工们，在严寒气候下战胜重重困难，保持了工程计划进度。佛子岭水库工地处在大别山区的群山之中，气候比山区以外更冷，但工人们不论是北风凛冽的早晨，或是霜花遍地的深夜，仍然爬在几十公尺高的连拱坝上夜以继日地坚持工作，并提高了工作效率。南湾水库机械二大队汽车中队的工人们为了赶运器材物资，提出了“不浪费一点时间”的口号，有时吃饭赶不上，就把馍馍塞在怀里带到车上吃。在三百九十里的距离内，汽车中队的工人们用十二部汽车五天运了八百多吨器材物资，超额完成了任务。
    【又讯】治淮工程中土方数量最多的淮河中游干支流分流工程，到一九五三年底已完成整个工程计划的百分之九十。工程的主要部分，如漴河、潼河的疏浚，峰山切岭、下草湾切岭，开挖泊岗引河等工程都已胜利完工或接近完工。目前整个工程已进入最后施工阶段，继续开挖泊岗引河，堵闭入淮河的支流。今年汛期以前，干支流分流工程即可全部完成。
