Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 18th: On January 5th, the Austrian government sent a note to the Soviet Embassy in Austria, requesting the Soviet government to study the Austrian question in order to achieve an early solution to the Austrian question at the upcoming Berlin Conference of the Four Foreign Ministers. The Austrian government also sent similar notes to the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

On January 16th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a reply note to the Austrian Embassy in Moscow. The note stated that the Soviet government has always advocated for the early resolution of the Austrian question in accordance with existing four-power decisions. The Soviet government believes that in order to strengthen European peace and guarantee the national rights of the Austrian people, it is necessary to re-establish a free and independent Austria.

The note further pointed out that the issue of an Austrian treaty has not been resolved to this day due to circumstances not determined by the Soviet Union. This situation has arisen in no small part because the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, with the support of the Austrian government, have insisted on proposals that contradict the respective obligations assumed by the four powers—including the draft Austrian treaty previously agreed upon in principle.

The Soviet note concluded by stating that, in view of the Austrian government's wishes, the Soviet government considers it necessary to declare that it is willing to make the greatest efforts to seek a final solution to the Austrian question and to hold corresponding negotiations. Whether this issue and the corresponding negotiations on an Austrian treaty with the participation of the Austrian government can succeed will depend on how all participants in the negotiations are truly committed to resolving this issue in accordance with the task of re-establishing a free and independent Austria and for the sake of consolidating European peace.

    奥政府要求四外长会议研究奥地利问题
    苏联表示愿尽力谋求奥地利问题的解决
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：一月五日，奥地利政府以照会一件送交苏联驻奥地利大使馆，就即将举行的四国外长柏林会议要求苏联政府研究奥地利问题，以求得奥地利问题的尽早解决。奥地利政府并以同样的照会送交法国、英国与美国政府。
    一月十六日，苏联外交部以复照一件送交奥地利驻莫斯科大使馆。照会说，苏联政府一向赞成按照现存的四国决定，尽早解决奥地利问题，苏联政府认为，为了加强欧洲和平并保证奥地利人民的民族权利，必须重新建立一个自由与独立的奥地利。
    照会进一步指出，由于不是由苏联所决定的情况，对奥和约问题一直到今天还没有解决。这种情况之所以发生，在不小程度上是由于美国、英国与法国政府，在奥地利政府的支持下，坚持那些与四国各自所承担的义务——包括以前在大体上已获致协议的对奥和约草案——相违背的建议。
    苏联照会最后说，鉴于奥地利政府的愿望，苏联政府认为有必要声明，它愿意尽最大力量来谋求奥地利问题的最后解决，并举行相应的谈判。这个问题以及有奥地利政府参加的关于对奥和约的相应谈判能否成功，将决定于这一谈判的所有参加者如何真正致力于根据重新建立一个自由与独立的奥地利的任务，并为了巩固欧洲和平的利益而解决这个问题。
