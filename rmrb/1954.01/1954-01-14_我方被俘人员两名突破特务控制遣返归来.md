Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 13th: Today, another Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel and a Korean People's Army captured personnel broke through special agent control and returned. One of them is suffering from severe mental illness, and the other is suffering from severe gastrointestinal illness. These two people, whose health was destroyed by long-term torture by the U.S. side, only stayed at the press conference for ten minutes before being sent to the hospital for treatment.

When the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returnee, Yu Zhonggui, appeared at the press conference, he just smiled at the Korean and Chinese representatives and could only simply say his own name. Many neutral nations personnel present expressed sympathy for Yu Zhonggui's condition after being tortured in this way.

Like many other North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war suffering from mental illness who have returned before, Yu Zhonggui's will to return to his country was firm. After escaping from the camp, when the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's subsidiary organization asked him if he wanted to be repatriated, he suspiciously asked at first: "I want to return home, can I return?" Then, he repeatedly said: "I want to go home, I want to go home!"

Another returning Korean People's Army captured personnel, Cui Chengde, could not bear the abuse of the special agents and attempted to hang himself on November 20th of last year. He was discovered by fellow prisoner Jin Longyun and rescued. On November 22nd of last year, Jin Longyun crossed the barbed wire fence and returned to file a complaint about this incident with the neutral nations personnel in Panmunjom. In the U.S. POW camp, Cui Chengde suffered from severe gastrointestinal illness due to long-term hunger. After entering the "hospital," he did not receive any treatment for a year. When the two sides exchanged sick and wounded prisoners of war last year, the U.S. side forcibly detained him again. After arriving at Dongchang-ri, he still did not receive treatment at the U.S. Army's 64th Field Hospital. Cui Chengde was dying and unable to live, and it was impossible to request repatriation, so he thought of committing suicide. After being rescued, he was sent to an Indian hospital for treatment until he applied for repatriation and returned.

While the U.S. side is frantically preparing to plunder North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, our captured personnel under the terrorist rule in the Dongchang-ri POW camp are constantly returning at the risk of their lives. This fully shows that it is necessary to continue the explanations so that the North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated.

### 我方被俘人员两名突破特务控制遣返归来

    我方被俘人员两名突破特务控制遣返归来
    【新华社开城十三日电】今天又有一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员和一名朝鲜人民军被俘人员突破特务控制遣返归来。他们一个是重神经病患者，一个是重肠胃病患者。这两名在美方长期折磨下被摧毁了健康的人，在记者招待会上只停留了十分钟，就被送往医院治疗。
    中国人民志愿军归来人员于忠桂在记者招待会上出现时候，只是对着朝中代表张嘴笑，只能简单地说他自己的名字。在场的许多中立国人员对于忠桂被折磨成如此的样子都表示同情。
    于忠桂和以前回来的许多患精神病的朝中战俘一样，要求回国的意志是坚决的。他在逃出营场后，在中立国遣返委员会附属机构询问他是否要求遣返时，开始时他怀疑地问道：“我想回国，回得去吗？”接着，他就一再地说：“我要回家，我要回家！”
    另一个归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员崔成德忍受不了特务的虐待，曾于去年十一月二十日企图上吊自杀，被难友金龙云发现急救下来。去年十一月二十二日金龙云翻铁丝网遣返归来后曾在板门店向中立国人员控诉过这件事情。在美方战俘营中，因为长期的饥饿，崔成德患了严重的肠胃病。他进了“医院”以后，一年内一直没有得到什么治疗。去年双方交换伤病战俘时，美方又把他强迫扣留了下来。来东场里以后，在美军第六十四野战医院仍得不到治疗。崔成德病得奄奄一息，求生不能，要求遣返又不可能，就想到自杀。被救以后，送到印度医院治疗，直到申请遣返归来。
    当美方正在疯狂地准备劫夺朝中战俘的时候，在东场里战俘营中恐怖统治下的我方被俘人员不断冒险归来，这充分说明必须继续进行解释，使朝中战俘有机会行使其被遣返权利。
