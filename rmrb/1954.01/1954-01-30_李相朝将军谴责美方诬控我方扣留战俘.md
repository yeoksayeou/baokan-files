Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 28th. Chief Korean-Chinese delegate to the Military Armistice Commission, General Li Xiangchao, wrote to the U.S. side's chief delegate, Lacey, on the 27th, condemning the U.S. for once again fabricating and slandering us without any factual basis for forcibly detaining prisoners of war in violation of the armistice agreement, and demanding that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission conduct special observation, inspection, and investigation. General Li Xiangchao also sent an identical letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

General Li Xiangchao pointed out: The reason why the U.S. side has shamelessly made repeated false accusations to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that we are forcibly detaining prisoners of war is entirely an attempt to reduce the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to a tool of the U.S. side, in order to cover up the U.S. side's large-scale detention of our captured personnel, so as to deceive the people of the world. The U.S. side's attempt has not achieved its purpose so far, and it will not be able to achieve its purpose in the future either. On January 18, the U.S. side requested the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to investigate the slanderous accusations that the Korean-Chinese side forcibly detained prisoners of war, but the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission rejected the U.S. side's request, which did not comply with the provisions of the armistice agreement.

General Li Xiangchao emphasized: The irrefutable fact that the U.S. side has forcibly detained our captured personnel on a large scale cannot be denied. Most of our captured personnel who were forcibly detained by the U.S. side have been forcibly incorporated into the military by the U.S. side. In most of the U.S. side's South Korean troops, even in the military organs and the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, there are now our captured personnel who have been forcibly detained by the U.S. side. We have full evidence of these facts.

General Li Xiangchao solemnly declared to the U.S. side and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission: The U.S. side has forcibly detained a large number of our captured personnel and has not yet made a responsible explanation. Only we have the right to request to conduct investigations in every or any troop unit of the U.S. side in South Korea, while the U.S. side has no basis whatsoever to accuse us and demand an investigation. We will never allow criminals to go unpunished, but instead arbitrarily slander law-abiding people. Any investigation that disregards the fact that the U.S. side is forcibly detaining prisoners of war and instead investigates the U.S. side's fabrications and slanders will only be a manipulation and insult to the armistice agreement and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and we firmly oppose it, and we cannot tolerate it.

General Li Xiangchao finally said: At present, the U.S. side must return the more than 21,900 of our captured personnel who were unilaterally and illegally declared by the U.S. side on January 23 to have changed their status as prisoners of war and were forcibly detained and are being incorporated into the military, to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The U.S. side must directly return the more than 27,000 of our captured personnel who were forcibly detained by the U.S. side in June 1953 and have been incorporated into the military directly to our side, and must make a responsible explanation for the other of our captured personnel out of the total of over 98,000.

　　李相朝将军谴责美方诬控我方扣留战俘
    【新华社开城二十八日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在二十七日写信给美方首席委员拉西，谴责美方又一次毫无事实根据地捏造和诬蔑我方违反停战协定强迫扣留战俘，并且要求中立国监察委员会进行特别观察、视察和调查。李相朝将军并把一封同样的函件送交中立国监察委员会。
    李相朝将军指出：美方所以厚颜无耻地接二连三向中立国监察委员会诬控我方扣留战俘，完全是企图把中立国监察委员会降为美方的工具，来掩盖美方大规模扣留我方被俘人员，借以蒙蔽世界人民。美方的这一企图至今未能达到目的，而且将来也是不能达到目的的。美方在一月十八日曾请求中立国监察委员会对所谓朝中方面强迫扣留战俘的诬蔑性指控进行调查，但中立国监察委员会拒绝了美方的这一不符合停战协定的规定的请求。
    李相朝将军强调指出：美方大规模强迫扣留我方被俘人员的铁的事实是无法抵赖的。被美方强迫扣留的我方被俘人员大多数被美方强迫编入军队。在美方南朝鲜的多数部队里，军事机关甚至南朝鲜的国防部里，现在都有被美方强迫扣留的我方被俘人员。我方对这些事实掌握有充分的证据。
    李相朝将军向美方及中立国监察委员会郑重声明：美方强迫扣留大批我方被俘人员，至今尚未作出负责的交代。只有我方才有权要求到美方南朝鲜的每一个或任何一个部队单位中去进行调查，而美方则根本没有任何根据来指控我方，要求调查。我方决不能容许罪犯逍遥法外，反来对守法者进行任意的诬蔑。任何抛开美方强迫扣留战俘的事实于不顾，而去就美方的捏造和诬蔑进行调查，将只是对于停战协定和中立国监察委员会的玩弄和侮辱，我方坚决反对，我方也不能容忍。
    李相朝将军最后说：目前是美方必须将一月二十三日被美方片面非法宣布改变战俘身份而强迫扣留并正在编入军队的二万一千九百余名不直接遣返的我方被俘人员交还中立国遣返委员会，必须将一九五三年六月被美方强迫扣留并已被编入军队的二万七千余名我方被俘人员直接交还给我方，必须对九万八千余名中的其他我方被俘人员作出负责的交代。
