　　Some Experiences in My Scientific Research Work
　　Wang Jiamo, First Deputy Director of the Industrial Economics Department, Renmin University of China, and Director of the Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning Teaching and Research Office
　　Last year I wrote a scientific paper entitled "Research on the Organization of Rhythm Production by Charts in the Northeast Machinery Plant No. 3". Now I would like to put forward some immature experiences in writing this scientific paper for the reference of comrades.
　　When I started writing this paper, I was just a graduate student; although I had some experience in leading factories and systematically studied scientific theory under the guidance of Soviet experts; I didn't know how to do scientific research work, nor did I recognize the importance of scientific research work for improving teaching quality and guiding practical work.
　　In May and June of the previous year, I went to Shenyang Machinery Plant No. 3 in Northeast China for a production internship. At that time, the factory's promotion of organizing rhythmic production according to charts had achieved remarkable results and was listed as the most important advanced experience at the Northeast Advanced Experience Summary and Promotion Conference. During my production internship, I collected information in this regard and conducted some preliminary research. But I didn't think about writing a scientific paper. It wasn't until after I returned to the school that the leadership asked me to write a scientific paper based on the materials collected during the internship to participate in the school's third scientific discussion that I considered this issue.
　　At that time, I didn't quite know what a scientific paper was. But I thought that scientific papers are different from lecture notes, and cannot simply expound theories and insert some practical materials to prove the correctness of the theories; scientific papers are also different from news reports, and cannot simply introduce the course of events. So I planned to take the factory's experience in organizing rhythmic production as the theme of the paper, to analyze the successful experience and advantages of the factory, to point out the shortcomings, and to propose methods for improvement.
　　But this was just my subjective intention. When I started writing, I knew that this goal was difficult to achieve. I found that the materials were incomplete. Some materials did not fully reflect the real situation of the factory. It was impossible to conduct practical research based on such materials. Of course, the judgment of advantages and disadvantages could only be made as a rough estimate. As for whether the proposed improvement methods were applicable, I was even less certain. Therefore, when writing, I had to be vague, and could only write some publicly published materials and other people's opinions, and I dared not specifically propose methods to overcome the shortcomings. Because there were no materials, the summary of the factory's experience was simply not written. As a result, the written paper was only some opinions in principle, and did not break away from the circle of simply expounding theory. But I thought that these opinions in principle were also not bad.
　　The paper I wrote was discussed at the Teaching and Research Office meeting. Soviet experts and other teachers raised many opinions. They unanimously believed that the educational target of this paper was not clear, it did not introduce the factory's working methods and the experience in the promotion process in detail, nor did it specifically propose improvement methods. In short, this paper was basically formalistic, did not explain the problem, nor did it solve the problem, it was just propaganda of theory. Soviet experts believed that such a paper was not worth reporting at all, and if it was to be reported, it would have to be rewritten, and it would be best to go to the factory again for in-depth research.
　　I accepted everyone's opinions and was willing to go to the factory again for an in-depth investigation and research to correct the shortcomings. The Teaching and Research Office also agreed with my approach.
　　Before going to Shenyang, I did some preparatory work. I checked what materials I was missing, and what problems needed in-depth research. I planned which departments I needed to go to obtain materials, who I needed to talk to, and what important phenomena I needed to observe. I also seriously considered the methods to overcome the shortcomings of the factory, carefully studied some reference books, came up with some improvement methods, and asked Soviet experts to help me solve some difficult problems.
　　When I arrived at the factory, I proceeded according to the plan. By this time it was October, and compared to June, their work had improved, some charts had been added and modified, and at the same time, the original shortcomings had been exposed more significantly. Therefore, I was not just supplementing and collecting materials, but almost re-collecting all the materials.
　　The work I did in the factory can be roughly divided into the following four steps:
　　The first step is to get materials, copy materials, and perform calculations. Some materials are readily available, some need to be copied, and some need to be calculated. This includes various planning forms, scheduling charts, calculation forms, and statistical figures.
　　The second step is to conduct interviews. Based on the materials, I raised many questions, and then found the relevant comrades to inquire in detail about the actual work situation, to deeply understand the problems that existed, to ask them to introduce their work experience, and to solicit their own opinions on improving the work. I contacted the factory director, deputy factory director, the heads and staff of the planning department and the production department, as well as the planners and dispatchers of the workshop. I also specially visited the former head of the operations planning section who had left the factory.
　　The third step is to observe on site. I felt that relying only on interviews was not enough, and it was necessary to observe important phenomena on site. The results of the observation proved that the comrades who do practical work did not understand some important situations very well, and the materials they used for external introduction also differed greatly from the actual situation. For example, there were no statistical materials on the number of work-in-process products, so I went to the workshop to count them, and as a result, I discovered a very important situation.
　　The fourth step is research. Based on the information I had learned, I initially proposed some methods to solve the problems, and then presented them to the comrades who did practical work to solicit their opinions. Some of my suggestions were considered by them to be good methods to solve the problems, and they were very welcome and prepared to follow my suggestions. Some suggestions they did not accept, and some suggestions they accepted only after I explained them in detail. At the same time, they also corrected some of my incorrect judgments on certain situations, and pointed out the unrealistic aspects of my suggestions. Regarding their work experience, I also summarized them with reference to their opinions, and then put them forward to solicit their opinions. Some problems could not be solved at that time and needed to be taken back to the school for research.
　　After returning to the school, I sorted out the materials and started writing, and continued to study the unresolved problems. Some problems could not be found in reference books, so I had to come up with solutions myself. In order to solve the problems, I consulted Soviet experts from the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government. In order to confirm in many ways whether my suggestions were applicable to other factories, I also sought the opinions of comrades from the Machine Industry Bureau and other machine factories who were engaged in this work, and enriched the content of the paper based on their opinions.
　　In this way, I rewrote the scientific paper.
　　I made a report at the scientific discussion meeting. Comrades inside and outside the school all unanimously believed that this paper was successful and had guiding significance for practical work. After the meeting, the school also printed and published it as a learning reference material for factory cadres and inside the school according to the suggestion of the First Ministry of Machine Building.
　　Through this scientific research work, I have the following experiences:
　　First, the topic of scientific research should be oriented to practice. The reason why my paper was welcomed was because it was a problem that factories urgently needed to solve at present. Only in this way can theory and practice be combined, and can Soviet experience and Chinese conditions be combined.
　　And for people who are new to research work, the topic should be small rather than large. It is difficult to do large topics, because they lack both scientific research ability and time. Although the topic I researched this time was not too big, I still felt strenuous. Many problems were not explained clearly, and many problems were not studied in depth.
　　Second, in scientific research, it is necessary to have a good grasp of basic theory. Some comrades who do practical work understand the actual situation more directly and richly than we do, but because they lack theoretical guidance, they often have unclear understanding of certain problems and cannot come up with solutions. They have many creations and experiences, but they will not summarize them well. If we do not have a grasp of basic theory, we are of course even inferior to them. Therefore, scientific research work must have a theoretical foundation, and in the process of scientific research, it is also necessary to continuously delve into theory. Only in this way can we make correct judgments on practical problems, and can we summarize practical experience to enrich theory.
　　Third, scientific research must grasp relatively rich practical materials, and conduct investigation and research in a realistic and pragmatic manner. We cannot draw conclusions rashly, nor can we apply general theories rigidly to practical problems. Otherwise, what we write will either be empty and useless, or distort the facts. The reason why the second paper I wrote was better than the first was because I conducted investigation and research in a realistic and pragmatic manner. But my investigation and research were still very insufficient, so some places in the paper are still empty, and some opinions are not fully grasped.
　　Fourth, in scientific research work, the weapons of criticism and self-criticism are indispensable. I deeply realized that without the guidance of Soviet experts and the criticism of comrades, my paper would definitely be a mess. It is precisely because I received continuous guidance and criticism that I was able to correct my shortcomings and do better each time.
　　However, I think that the guidance and criticism I received were still very insufficient. During the discussion, the comrades only raised opinions on my oral report, and did not carefully review the full text, which allowed me to retain some errors that I did not realize in the printed paper.
　　Fifth, when starting scientific research work, it is best to do it collectively with several people. In this research work, I deeply felt the difficulty of conducting scientific research alone. When I encountered difficult problems to solve, I could not find anyone to discuss them with, because other comrades did not conduct investigation and research with me. If several people researched together, the results would definitely be better.
　　Sixth, scientific research work has a great effect on improving teachers and teaching quality. This is what I realized later.
　　In the process of my research, practical problems were placed in front of me, which prompted me to delve into theory more deeply and made me better understand the theories I had learned before. After I carried out this scientific research work, when writing lecture notes on this aspect of the problem, I was able to not stick to the original text of the Soviet experts' lectures. It was less difficult to write, and it was more flexible and vivid, unlike other parts where I could not even explain clearly. And my knowledge accumulation in this area has also been of great help to other teachers.
　　When I lectured factory leaders in Tianjin, I used some materials and important conclusions from this paper in the topic of "Production Operations Planning Work". After the course, they generally believed that this topic was the best, because it not only clearly introduced the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the working methods of advanced factories in China, but also pointed out the steps and methods for Chinese factories to go from backwardness to advancement. They hoped that every topic could be taught in this way. I think that if we want to do this, there is no other way but to conduct scientific research in combination with the actual situation in China for each topic.

　　我做科学研究工作的一些经验
    中国人民大学工业经济系第一副主任
    兼工业企业组织与计划教研室主任  王嘉谟
    前年我写了一篇科学论文，题目是“东北机械三厂按图表组织节奏生产的研究”。现在我把写这篇科学论文的一些不成熟的经验提出来，供同志们参考。
    我开始写这篇论文的时候，还只是刚毕业的研究生；虽然，我有过一些领导工厂的经验，并在苏联专家指导下系统地学习了科学理论；但我不知道如何做科学研究工作，也不认识科学研究工作对于提高教学质量和指导实际工作的重要意义。
    前年五六月间，我到东北沈阳机械三厂去进行生产实习。当时，该厂推行按图表组织节奏生产已经得到显著成绩，在东北先进经验总结推广大会上被列为最主要的先进经验。我在生产实习过程中便搜集了这方面的资料，并作了一些初步的研究。但我没有想到写科学论文。直到回校以后，领导上要我根据在实习中搜集的资料写一篇科学论文参加本校第三次科学讨论会时，我才考虑到这一问题。
    当时，我还不很知道怎样才是科学论文。但是我想，科学论文和讲义不同，不能只是阐述理论和插入一些实际资料来证明理论的正确性；科学论文也和通讯报道不同，不能只是介绍事实经过。所以我就打算：拿该厂组织节奏生产的经验作为论文的主题，要分析该厂成功的经验和优点，也要指出缺点，并要提出改进的方法来。
    但这只是我的主观意图。当我一着手写的时候，我就知道这个目标是难于达到的。我发现材料不完备。有些材料并不完全反映该厂的真实情况。根据这样的材料是不能进行切实的研究的，当然，对于优点和缺点的判断也只能作一些大概的估计，至于提出的改进方法是否适用，就更没有把握了。因此写的时候只好含糊些，只能写些已经公开发表的材料和别人的意见，不敢具体地提出克服缺点的方法。对于该厂经验的总结，因为没有材料，只好不写。结果写成的论文只是一些原则性的意见，没有脱离单纯阐述理论的圈子。但我以为，这些原则性的意见也是不坏的。
    在教研室会议上讨论了我写的论文。苏联专家和其他教员提出了很多意见。他们一致地认为这篇论文的教育对象不明确，没有详细地介绍该厂的工作方法和推行过程中的经验，也没有具体地提出改进方法。总之，这篇论文基本上还是形式主义的，不说明问题，也不解决问题，只不过是宣传理论。苏联专家认为这样的论文根本不值得报告，要报告就得改写，最好能再到该厂去深入研究一次。
    我接受了大家的意见，愿意再去该厂进行一次深入地调查研究来改正缺点。教研室也同意了我这种作法。
    在去沈阳以前，我做了一些准备工作。检查了一下我缺少什么材料，那些问题需要深入研究。计划了一下需要到那些部分去取得材料，需要和那些人进行谈话和观察那些重要的现象。关于克服该厂缺点的方法也认真地考虑了一下，仔细地研究了一些参考书，想出一些改进方法，并请苏联专家帮助我解决了一些疑难问题。
    到了该厂，我便按计划进行工作。这时已是十月，比起六月来，他们的工作已经有了改进，增加和修改了一些图表，而同时，原有的缺点也暴露得更加显著。因此我就不只是补充搜集材料，而几乎是重新搜集全部材料。
    我在厂里进行的工作大体上可以分为以下四个步骤：
    第一步是要材料、抄材料和进行计算。有些材料是现成的，有些要抄，有些要经过计算。其中包括各种计划表格、调度图表、计算表格和统计数字。
    第二步是进行谈话。我根据材料提出许多问题，然后找有关的同志，详细地询问实际工作情况，深入地了解其中存在的问题，请他们介绍工作经验，征求他们自己对改进工作的意见。我先后和厂长、副厂长、计划科和生产科的科长、股长和职员、以及车间的计划员和调度员接触，我还特地去拜访了已经离厂的前任作业计划股长。
    第三步是实地观察。我感到只依靠谈话还不够，必须实地观察重要现象。观察的结果证明，做实际工作的同志们对某些重要的情况了解得很不够，他们对外介绍用的材料和实际情况也有很大出入。例如在制品数量方面没有统计材料，我便到车间中去点数，结果发现了很重要的情况。
    第四步是研究。我根据了解的情况初步拟出一些解决问题的方法，然后向实际工作同志提出来，征求他们的意见。在我的建议中，有一些被他们认为是解决问题的好方法，非常欢迎，准备按照我的建议去做。有些建议他们不接受，有些建议经过我详细解释以后才接受。同时他们也修正了我对某些情况的判断的不正确的地方，指出了我的建议中不切合实际的地方。关于他们工作中的经验，我也参考他们的意见总结起来，再提出来征求他们的意见。有些问题是当时解决不了的，需要回校进行研究。
    回校以后，我便整理材料进行写作，并且继续研究了未解决的问题。有些问题是在参考书中找不到答案的，只好自己想出解决办法来。为了解决问题，我曾请教过中央人民政府第一机械工业部的苏联专家。为了多方面证实我的建议是否适用于其他工厂，我也征求过机器工业局和其他机器厂中搞这方面工作的同志们的意见，并根据他们的意见充实了论文内容。
    这样，我便重新写成了科学论文。
    我在科学讨论会上作了报告。校内和校外的同志们都一致地认为这篇论文是成功的，对实际工作有指导意义。会后，学校还根据第一机械工业部的建议，把它印刷出版，作为工厂干部和校内的学习参考资料。
    经过这次科学研究工作，我有这样几点体会：
    第一、选择科学研究的题目应该面向实际。我这篇论文之所以受到欢迎，便是因为它是目前工厂中迫切需要解决的问题。只有这样做，才能使理论和实际结合，才能使苏联经验和中国情况结合。
    并且对于初作研究工作的人来说，选择的题目宜小不宜大。大题目很难做，因为既缺乏科学研究能力又缺乏时间。我这次研究的题目虽然不太大，可是我还是感到吃力，许多问题没有交代清楚，许多问题没能进行深入的研究。
    第二、进行科学研究时必须很好地掌握基本理论。一部分做实际工作的同志了解实际情况比我们更直接、更丰富，但是因为缺乏理论的指导，所以往往对某些问题认识不清，拿不出办法。他们有很多创造和经验，可是不会很好地总结。如果我们没有掌握基本理论，当然就更不如他们。所以进行科学研究工作必须具备理论基础，在科学研究过程中也还要不断地钻研理论。这样才能对实际问题作出正确的判断，才能把实际经验总结起来丰富理论。
    第三、进行科学研究必须掌握比较丰富的实际材料，要实事求是地进行调查研究，不能草率地下结论，也不能用一般理论硬套实际问题，否则写成的东西不是空洞无物，便是歪曲事实。我第二次写的论文比第一次好，就是因为实事求是地进行了调查研究。但是我调查研究得还很不够，所以在论文中有些地方还空洞，有些意见还没有充分把握。
    第四、在科学研究工作中，批评和自我批评的武器是不可缺少的。我深深地体会到，如果没有苏联专家的指导和同志们的批评，我的论文一定搞得不成东西。正因为我得到了不断的指导和批评，我才能改正缺点，做得一次比一次好。
    不过我以为我得到的指导和批评还很不够。在讨论的时候，同志们只是对我的口头报告提出意见，并没有仔细地审阅过全文，这便使我在印成的论文中还保留着我所没有认识到的一些错误。
    第五、在初做科学研究工作时，最好由几个人集体地做。我在这次研究工作中，深深地感到单独一个人进行科学研究的困难。遇到难解决的问题，找不到人共同商量，因为别的同志并没有和我一同进行调查研究。如果有几个人共同研究，成绩一定更好。
    第六、科学研究工作对提高教师和教学质量的作用很大。这是我后来才体会到的。
    在我研究的过程中，实际问题摆在面前，推动我更深入地钻研理论，使我更好地体会原来学过的理论。在我进行了这次科学研究工作以后，写到有关这方面问题的讲稿时，便能不死守苏联专家讲义的原文，写起来困难既少，又能灵活生动，不像别的部分连解释都解释不清楚。并且我在这方面的知识积累，对于其他教师也有很大帮助。
    我在天津给工厂领导干部讲课时，把这篇论文中的一些材料和重要结论用到“生产作业计划工作”讲题中去。课程结束后，他们普遍地认为这一讲题讲得最好，因为它不但清楚地介绍了苏联先进经验和中国先进工厂的工作方法，并且指出了中国工厂由落后走向先进的步骤和方法。他们希望每个讲题都能这样讲。我想，如果要做到这样，除了每个讲题都结合中国实际进行科学研究以外，是没有别的办法的。
