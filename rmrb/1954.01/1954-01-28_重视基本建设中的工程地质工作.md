　　The Importance of Engineering Geological Work

　　Engineering geological work is the foundation of all design work, and accurate engineering geological data is essential for correct design. According to the needs of each stage of the design, engineering geological surveys should be collected at each stage, providing data on the regional climate, water system, topography, geology, mineral resources and building materials, hydrogeological conditions, natural geological phenomena, and the physical and mechanical properties of the foundation soil. These natural conditions determine the selection of plant sites, the overall layout of buildings, the types of buildings, the design and construction of foundations, and major issues such as water supply and drainage.

　　In the past three years of practical work, we have deeply realized the significant role of engineering geology in basic construction. Whether engaged in geological work, design work, or construction work, any negligence in engineering geology will cause significant losses to basic construction.

　　Facts have proven that many projects designed without surveying have either resulted in rework and waste or caused quality accidents. For example, the construction project of the opening and cleaning workshop of Jinzhou Textile Factory was designed without geological surveying, causing the building to sink downwards after construction, making it impossible to install machinery. Only after studying the soil properties was it discovered that the soil was highly porous and subsided when exposed to water. If we had conducted an engineering geological survey before design and taken precautions to prevent water from seeping into the soil during construction, this accident could have been completely avoided.

　　Incorrect survey data can also cause serious errors. For example, in the foundry workshop project of Machinery Plant No. 11, the engineering geological personnel overlooked the existence of an underlying weak soil layer and adopted an unsafe bearing capacity when designing the foundation. As a result, several foundations had to be destroyed, several foundations had to be enlarged, and reinforced concrete beams had to be replaced with steel beams, causing significant waste and delaying the completion date by several months.

　　Construction departments not following geological conditions during construction can also lead to similar results. For example, the main building of Harbin Institute of Technology is a six-story building. After surveying, it was determined that the site was secondary collapsible loess. The designer also emphasized in the construction drawings that water must be prevented from entering during construction. However, the construction department did not pay attention to this advice and did not take any waterproof measures. The foundation was not backfilled in time after it was built. During heavy rain, the foundation pit was filled with water, and as a result, the house developed large cracks shortly after completion.

　　The above examples illustrate that in basic construction, designers must actively collect and correctly use data, engineering geological workers must provide correct data, and construction personnel should also determine measures based on the characteristics of the soil. Only in this way can errors be avoided.

　　Lessons Learned

　　How should surveying work be carried out? Based on our experience over the past few years, we believe that the most important point is to study Soviet scientific theory and advanced technology. China's scientific foundation in engineering geology is very weak, and the establishment of engineering geology departments in universities is a recent development. To rapidly improve surveying standards, we must learn from the Soviet Union. Looking back at our progress in work over the past few years, almost everything has been the result of learning from the Soviet Union. For example, in the past, we were extremely conservative in determining the compressive strength of soil. After experts introduced Soviet norms, we took a step forward in this most important issue. In terms of drilling methods, in the past, whether encountering sand or clay soil, we used Japanese-style extraction tube drilling with water, which changed the structure and moisture content of the soil, making it impossible to grasp the most important properties of the soil. Moreover, the efficiency was very low, with a daily progress of only about four meters. After using Soviet drilling rigs, different drill bits were used for different strata, and undisturbed soil samples could also be taken. The maximum drilling speed was increased by eight times compared to before. There are too many similar cases, and each one has deeply educated us.

　　Secondly, surveying work must be carried out according to procedures. Preliminary surveys must be conducted before preliminary design to provide designers with information for overall layout. After the overall layout is completed, engineering geological surveys for the technical design stage can be carried out to provide more accurate geological data for the technical design of each building. Any violation of this procedure will result in failure. For example, in the Northeast Tiexi Workers' Village project, due to time constraints, surveying, design, and engineering geology were required to be carried out simultaneously, and construction was carried out without surveying for the technical design stage. As a result, during construction, weak strata not found during surveying were excavated in the foundation trenches of several buildings. Temporary remedial measures were taken, but one dormitory still cracked due to the inconsistent soil properties. If preliminary surveys had been conducted, the distribution of strong and weak foundations on the site could have been understood, and important buildings could have been placed on good foundations, which would not only ensure the safety of the buildings but also make the foundation design extremely economical.

　　Third, it is necessary to strengthen contact with design and construction departments. The purpose of surveying work is to collect data for design. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the design requirements before surveying and determine the entire surveying steps and methods accordingly. We have had failed experiences in this regard. For example, for the survey of Dalian Chemical Plant, we only knew from the blueprints that it was a large workshop and treated it as a general factory building. When encountering a relatively hard gravel layer that was difficult to drill through, we stopped drilling, assuming that the foundation could be set on a good stratum. Later, the design department contacted us and informed us that the building was a nine-story major workshop with extremely heavy equipment foundations, which must be built on rock. Because we did not understand this situation beforehand, we did not conduct a detailed understanding of the rock during the survey, so the data was insufficient and could not meet the needs of the design.

　　The understanding of underground conditions in surveying work relies on the soil conditions in a few boreholes. Therefore, the grasp of the stratum distribution in the plant area is limited. The closest distance between boreholes is 20 meters, but there may still be undiscovered soil layers between the boreholes. This requires surveying personnel to go deep into the construction site during the building's construction period to conduct supplementary investigations during the construction phase, check whether the stratum in the foundation trench matches the previous exploration results, and solve some temporary foundation problems with the construction and design departments. We have sent technical personnel to major projects in Harbin, Changchun, and other places to carry out this work, and the results have been significant.

　　Fourth, on-site drilling records and analysis and testing work must be done well. On-site drilling, sampling, and recording are the foundations of engineering geological work. If sampling descriptions are inaccurate, soil samples are disturbed, and original data is chaotic, the analysis and testing results and the summary of the survey report will inevitably be incorrect. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for drilling, recording, analysis, and testing personnel, so that they value their work and strictly implement various regulations and systems.

　　Fifth, various management systems must be improved, and inspection of each link must be strengthened. Before we established various management systems and inspection systems, the work was extremely chaotic and errors often occurred. Later, we strengthened the inspection of each link, stipulated the surveying procedures and the responsibilities of technical personnel at all levels and drilling workers, strengthened a series of work from the decision of the surveying outline to the review and verification of the summary report, stipulated that each project should be responsible to a technical personnel from beginning to end, and took other measures, so that the surveying work could be carried out normally and human errors were avoided.

　　Sixth, surveying personnel must have a realistic and truth-seeking scientific attitude and a comprehensive way of thinking about problems. The nature of engineering geological surveying is to truthfully reflect natural conditions. Therefore, engineering geological personnel should consider problems with a high degree of objectivity and draw conclusions and judgments based on evidence. Any subjective guesses and pretending to know what one does not know will lead to serious errors. Our lessons in this regard are also extremely great. For example, the technical personnel responsible for the Harbin Songjiang Provincial Party School project only touched the soil on site and told the designers to design according to 20 tons. After analysis, it was found that the bearing capacity was only 15 tons. At this time, the wall had been built above the ground, and it had to be reworked. There is more than one similar lesson. These lessons all tell us that the spirit of seeking truth from facts and the humble attitude of learning what one does not know must become the motto of surveying personnel.

　　Existing Problems and Improvement Measures

　　First, many units or management agencies that entrust surveying have not yet realized the importance of engineering geological work. They do not understand that design cannot be carried out without surveying, and they do not understand that surveying work should be carried out in several stages. Many units do not consider surveying issues beforehand and only conduct surveying when they want to design or construct. Many units see that we cannot meet their time requirements and even take measures to increase the safety factor and waste state property, and carry out construction without surveying. This situation must be changed. Enterprises that entrust surveying and national planning departments should allow sufficient time for engineering geological surveying and conduct it one or two quarters before design. Otherwise, surveying, design, and construction are squeezed together, and the result is either that the surveying work is done hastily, or the design and construction are stopped and waiting for materials, which are harmful to the country's basic construction.

　　Second, there is a lack of meteorological and hydrological data. These two types of data are necessary for design and are an important part of the engineering geological report. The longer these data are accumulated, the more valuable they are. However, there was no such data before liberation. Although many meteorological and hydrological stations have begun to record these data after liberation, the items are incomplete. The data on the freezing depth of the region, which is of great significance to architectural design, is not recorded and organized. Although some meteorological stations also have records of underground temperature, they are inconsistent, making people at a loss. We believe that the national architectural design department should strengthen contact with relevant meteorological and water conservancy departments and local construction bureaus, and everyone should organize to collect and organize all the meteorological and hydrological data needed for design for a long time.

　　In addition, conducting perennial subsidence observations on important buildings to develop old theories and create new experiences also requires close cooperation between national engineering geology and architectural design departments.

　　重视基本建设中的工程地质工作
    重工业部设计公司工程地质科科长　周叔举
      工程地质工作的重要性
    工程地质工作是一切设计工作的基础，必须有了充分的精确的工程地质资料，才能进行正确的设计。按着设计各个阶段的需要，工程地质勘测应分别在各个阶段搜集，应提出区域的气候、水系、地形、地质、矿藏及建筑材料、水文地质条件、自然地质现象及地基土壤的物理力学性质等资料。这些自然条件决定着厂基的选择，建筑物的总平面配置，建筑物的类型，基础的设计及施工，以及给水排水等重大问题。
    在过去三年多的实际工作中，我们深深体会到工程地质在基本建设中的重大作用。无论是从事地质工作、设计工作或是施工工作的人，如果对工程地质稍有疏忽大意，都将给基本建设造成重大的损失。
    事实证明，有许多未经勘测即行设计的工程，不是造成返工浪费就是造成质量事故。如锦州纺织厂清花车间的建筑工程，没有进行地质勘测即进行设计，致建筑物造成后向下沉陷，无法安装机器。再去研究土的性质，才发现这里原来是遇水就下沉的大孔性土。如果我们在设计前先进行了工程地质勘测，在施工中注意不要使水渗入土中，这件事故是完全可以避免的。
    勘测资料不正确，也同样会造成严重的错误。如机械十一厂的铸工车间工程，由于工程地质人员忽视了下卧软弱土层的存在，作设计基础时采用了不安全的地耐力，结果不得不将若干基础毁掉，将若干基础加大，将钢筋混凝土梁改成钢梁，既造成很大浪费，又使竣工日期推迟了好几个月。
    施工部门不按照地质情况施工，结果也是一样的。如哈尔滨工业大学的主楼是六层的建筑物，经勘测后，已判明该地是二级下沉性大孔土。设计者在施工图上也强调了在建筑期间必须防止水的浸入。但施工部门没有重视这个意见，没有采取任何防水措施，基础建好后也没有及时回填土，在暴雨期间基础坑内积满了水，结果房子建成不久就裂了很大的缝。
    上面这些例子说明了：在基本建设中，设计人员必须主动搜集和正确地运用资料，工程地质工作者必须提供正确的资料，施工人员也应该根据土的特性决定措施。只有这样才能避免错误。
      经验教训
    怎样来进行勘测工作呢？根据我们几年来的体会，觉得最重要的一点就是学习苏联的科学理论和先进技术。我国工程地质方面的科学基础是很薄弱的，高等学校里设有工程地质系还是不久的事。要迅速地提高勘测水平，只有向苏联学习。回顾几年来我们在工作上的进步，几乎没有一点不是学习苏联的结果。例如过去我们在决定土的耐压强度时，异常保守。经专家介绍了苏联规范之后，才使我们在这个最重要的问题上前进了一步。在钻探方法上，过去无论是遇到砂或粘性土，都是采用日本式抽筒加水钻进，使土的结构和含水量都改变了，无法掌握土的最主要性质。而且效率很低，每日只能进尺约四公尺。使用苏联钻机后，各种地层分别使用不同的钻头，原状土也可以取了，钻进的最高速度较前提高了八倍。类似这样的事情太多了，每一件事都深深地教育了我们。
    其次，勘测工作必须按照程序进行。初步设计前必须先做初步设计阶段的勘查，以供设计者做总平面配置。当总平面配置完毕后，才能做技术设计阶段的工程地质勘测，为每一建筑物的技术设计提出更精确的地质资料。任何违反这一程序的都要遭到失败。如东北铁西工人村工程，因时间过紧，要求测量设计和工程地质同时进行，而且又不进行技术设计阶段的勘测即进行施工，结果临到施工时，好几幢建筑物地槽内挖出了勘测时所未发现的软弱地层，曾经临时设法补救，但仍有一幢宿舍因地层性质不一而开裂了。如果作了初步勘测，就能了解场内地基强弱的分布状况，将重要的建筑物配置在好的地基上，不仅能保证建筑物的安全，且能使基础设计得极为经济。
    第三、必须加强和设计、施工部门的联系。勘测工作的目的是为设计搜集资料，因此，在勘测之前必须弄清设计的要求，据以决定整个勘测的步骤和方法。我们在这个问题上曾有过失败的教训。例如对大连化学厂的勘测，事前仅从蓝图上知道这是一个大的车间，就把它当做一般厂房来进行勘测。当遇到较为坚固的碎石层难以钻进时，即不再往下钻，满以为基础可以设在良好的地层上了。后来设计部门和我们联系，才知道建筑物是九层大楼的重大车间，而且里面有极重大的设备基础，一定要砌在岩石上。由于事先不了解这个情况，勘测时未对岩石作详细的了解，因而资料很不充分，未能满足设计的需要。
      勘测工作对地下情况的了解，是依靠少数几个钻孔内的土层情况得来的，因此对厂区地层分布情况的掌握也就有一定的限度。钻孔最近的距离是二十公尺，但钻孔之间仍可能有未发现的土层。这就要求勘测人员在建筑物施工期间深入工地作施工阶段的补查，检查基础槽内地层是否符合于以前勘探的结果，并与施工、设计部门解决一些临时发生的地基问题。我们曾派出技术人员到哈尔滨、长春等地的重要工程进行这项工作，收效很大。
    第四、必须做好现场钻探记录和分析化验工作。现场的钻探、取样、记录等是工程地质工作的基础。如果取样描述得不准确，土试料受扰动，原始资料混乱，则据此所作的分析化验结果以及勘测报告的总结必然是错误的。因此，必须对钻探、记录、分析化验工作人员加强思想教育，使他们重视自己的工作，严格执行各种规程和制度。
    第五、必须健全各种管理制度，加强对各个环节的检查。我们未建立各种管理制度和检查制度前，工作极为混乱，常发生错误。后来加强了对各个环节的检查，规定了勘测程序和各级技术人员、钻探工人的责任，加强了由决定勘测大纲起直至总结报告的审核、复核等一系列工作，规定了每一工程由一个技术人员负责到底的制度，并采取了其他一些措施，就使得勘测工作得以正常地进行，避免了人为的错误。
    第六、勘测人员必须具备实事求是的科学态度和全面考虑问题的思想方法。工程地质勘测的性质就是真实地反映自然条件。因此工程地质人员就应该高度客观地考虑问题，有根有据地作出结论和判断。任何主观猜测，强不知以为知的做法，必将导致严重的错误。我们在这方面的教训也是极大的。如负责哈尔滨松江省党校工程的技术人员仅在现场用手摸一下土，就告诉设计人员按二十吨设计，经分析后，才知耐压力只有十五吨。此时墙已砌出地面了，只好返工。类似的教训不只这一个。这些教训都告诉我们，言必有据的实事求是精神和不知就学的虚心态度，必须成为勘测人员的座右铭。
    目前存在的问题和改进办法
    第一，目前很多委托勘测的单位或管理机关的计划部门尚未认识到工程地质工作的重要性，不了解没有进行勘测就不可能进行设计，不了解勘测工作要分几个阶段来进行。有许多单位事前不考虑勘测问题，等到要设计或施工时才来进行勘测。有许多单位看到我们不能满足他们在时间上的要求，甚至采取加大安全系数，浪费国家财产的办法，不进行勘测即行施工。这种状况必须改变，委托勘测的企业及国家计划部门应为工程地质勘测留有足够的时间，将它提到设计之前一个或两个季度进行。否则，勘测和设计施工挤在一起，其结果或者是勘测工作草率求成，或者是设计、施工方面停工待料，都是对国家的基本建设有害的。
    第二，缺少气象、水文资料。这两种资料是设计所必需的，是工程地质报告中很重要的一部分。这些资料愈是积累得长久就愈有价值。但解放前没有这方面的资料，解放后许多气象站和水文站虽已开始记录这些资料，但项目不全。像地区的冻结深度这种对建筑设计有极大作用的资料竟没有人记录和整理。有些气象站虽也有地下温度的记载，但都不一致，使人无所适从。我们认为，国家的建筑设计部门应和有关的气象、水利部门及各地建设局加强联系，大家组织起来，长期地搜集和整理设计所需要的一切气象、水文资料。
    此外，对重要建筑物进行常年的下沉观测，以发展旧的理论和创造新的经验，也是需要全国的工程地质和建筑设计部门密切合作的。
