    Why Does the Zhengjiatun Railway Material Factory Treat Good Materials as Scrap?
    A letter from Zhang Guanglu of the Zhengjiatun Engineering Section: In early October last year, the Zhengjiatun Railway Material Factory was preparing to sell a batch of scrap iron. However, mixed in with the scrap iron were many track spikes, all of good quality, most of them new. Our track maintenance workers in the Engineering Section felt sorry to see this and wanted to exchange scrap spikes for these good ones, but they refused. The head of the Engineering Section negotiated directly with the responsible comrade of the Zhengjiatun Railway Material Factory, but it didn't work. Finally, they negotiated with a comrade surnamed Liu from the Materials Supply Department of the Jinzhou Railway Administration, and the factory finally agreed to exchange the good spikes for us. As a result, our section's workers picked out about 14,000 good track spikes from this pile of scrap iron, more than 8,000 of which were brand new.
    In mid-October last year, the factory sent dozens of "bridge sleepers" measuring 200mm square and more than two meters long to the Zhengjiatun Railway Area Party Committee office as firewood. These timbers were all new, mostly good "Korean pine," and could be used as frost damage boards. We negotiated with the Party Secretary and exchanged these good materials for broken sleepers. According to our understanding, the factory still has a lot of the same timber, ready to be used as firewood in the winter.
    Workers across the country are trying every means to increase production and practice economy, accumulating funds for the country. However, the Zhengjiatun Railway Material Factory carelessly treats useful state materials as scrap. This situation is intolerable.

### 郑家屯铁路材料厂为什么把好材料当废料处理

　　郑家屯铁路材料厂为什么把好材料当废料处理
    郑家屯工务段张广禄来信：去年十月上旬，郑家屯铁路材料厂准备出卖一批废铁。但是废铁堆里混着很多道钉，质量都很好，其中大部分还都是新的。我们工务段的养路工人看了都感到心疼，想用废道钉换出这些好道钉；但是他们却不答应。工务段段长直接和郑家屯铁路材料厂负责同志商量，结果也不行。最后和锦州铁路管理局材料供应处一位姓刘的同志交涉了，该厂才答应把好道钉换给我们。结果，我段工人们在这堆废铁里挑出了一万四千个左右的好道钉，其中有八千多个是全新的。
    去年十月中旬，该厂把几十根二百公厘见方、两公尺多长的“桥梁枕木”送给郑家屯铁路地区党委办公室作引火柴。这些木料都是新的，大部分都是好“国松”，能用作冻害板。我们就和党委书记交涉，才用破枕木把这些好材料换了过来。据我们了解，该厂还存有不少同样的木材，准备在冬天当柴火用。
    各地工人群众都想尽办法增产节约，为国家积累资金。可是，郑家屯铁路材料厂却毫不在乎地把国家有用器材当废料处理。这种情况是令人不能容忍的。
