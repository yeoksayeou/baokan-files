    Liaodong Province Actively Strengthens Grain Transfer Work
    Liaodong Province is actively trying to transfer grain purchased by grassroots cooperatives. Some time ago, large quantities of grain purchased by grassroots cooperatives in many areas of Liaodong Province, such as Xi'an, Xifeng, Dongfeng, Huinan, and Hailong counties, were stockpiled, affecting grain purchasing and material supply work. In Xi'an County, grassroots cooperatives stockpiled more than 3,000 tons of grain, with an average of 100,000 to 150,000 jin stockpiled per cooperative, and up to 500,000 jin in some cases. In Dongfeng County, five grassroots cooperatives in the Eighth District stockpiled more than 1.8 million jin of grain. Because the grain could not be transported out, grassroots cooperatives could not receive purchase funds from the grain company in a timely manner, which forced them to use cooperative working capital, thus affecting the cooperative's procurement. At the same time, because grassroots cooperatives did not have enough cash, they could not pay all farmers' grain sales payments in a timely manner, which also affected farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain. In Xi'an County, due to grain stockpiles and other reasons, commodities such as twill fabric, printed cloth, cotton, dog skin hats, and soybean oil were out of stock in many grassroots cooperatives. The Fucheng Village grassroots cooperative in Xifeng County and others have been issuing "IOUs" to farmers selling grain due to grain stockpiles and insufficient cash.
    The reasons for the excessive accumulation of grain in grassroots cooperatives, in addition to the fact that the local rural areas are in the threshing season, which occupies part of the transportation capacity, are mainly that the leaders of various counties did not pay attention to organizing transportation work in grain purchasing early enough, and did not organize and utilize the urban transportation capacity well; secondly, the state-owned grain departments, cooperatives, and transportation departments did not have close enough contact and did not jointly find ways to solve this problem in a timely manner.
    After discovering this situation, the Liaodong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Liaodong Provincial People's Government promptly instructed all counties to strengthen the leadership of transportation work in grain purchasing and to solve the problem of excessive grain accumulation in grassroots cooperatives in a timely and effective manner. The specific measures are: to organize urban transportation forces to go to the countryside to carry out grain transportation; to organize all animal power in rural areas except for threshing, and to transport grain out in a planned manner; grain companies should continue to allocate purchase funds to supply and marketing cooperatives that have already stockpiled grain; rural supply and marketing cooperatives should organize procurement and fully supply according to the needs of farmers. The Liaodong Provincial People's Government also held a meeting of county heads of key counties in northern Liaoning in Meihekou to specifically study this issue. At present, the problem of excessive grain accumulation in grassroots cooperatives in several counties such as Huinan has been resolved.

    辽东省积极加强粮食调运工作
    辽东省积极设法调运基层合作社收购的粮食。前些日子，辽东省西安、西丰、东丰、辉南、海龙等县许多地区收购的粮食大批积压在基层合作社里，影响了收购粮食工作和物资供应工作。西安县各基层合作社共积存三千余吨粮食，平均一个基层合作社积压十万斤到十五万斤，多者达五十万斤。东丰县第八区五个基层合作社就积存一百八十余万斤粮食。由于粮食不能运出，基层合作社不能及时向粮食公司领取购粮款，就不得不占用合作社流动资金，这样就影响了合作社的进货；同时，由于基层合作社现金不足，不能及时支付全部农民售粮款，也影响了农民售粮情绪。西安县由于粮食积压等原因，许多基层合作社的斜纹布、花布、棉花、狗皮帽子、豆油等物资发生了脱销的现象。西丰县福成村基层合作社等因积存粮食，现款不足，已给售粮农民打“白条子”。
    产生基层合作社粮食积存过多现象的原因，除当地农村正处于打场时期，占用了一部分运输力量外，主要是各县领导方面没有及早注意组织购粮中的运输工作，没有将城镇运输力量加以很好的组织运用；其次是国营粮食部门、合作社和运输部门联系不够密切，没有及时共同设法解决这一问题。
    中共辽东省委会和辽东省人民政府发现这一情况后，及时指示各县，要求加强对购粮中运输工作的领导，及时有效地解决基层合作社粮食积存过多的问题。具体办法是：组织城镇运输力量下乡突击运粮；将农村除打场用的一切畜力组织起来，有计划地把粮运出；粮食公司要对已积压粮食的供销合作社继续拨给购粮款；农村供销合作社应根据农民需要，及时组织进货，充分供应。辽东省人民政府并在梅河口召开了辽北重点县的县长会议，专门研究了这一问题。目前，辉南等几个县基层合作社的粮食积存过多问题已经解决。
