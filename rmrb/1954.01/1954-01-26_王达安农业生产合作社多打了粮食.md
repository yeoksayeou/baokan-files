Wang Daan Agricultural Production Cooperative Reaps a Bumper Harvest
By Our Reporter Lin Mo

In the past two years, fifty-nine agricultural production cooperatives have been established in various parts of Southwest China on a trial basis, based on mutual aid teams. After the establishment of the cooperatives, the harvests are generally better than those of mutual aid teams, and even better than those of individual farmers. To illustrate, let's take the Wang Daan Agricultural Production Cooperative, which was established less than a year ago.

The Wang Daan Agricultural Production Cooperative is located in the Eighth Village, Zunde Township, Santai County, Sichuan Province. It was formed by the merger of two mutual aid teams led by Yang Bangyuan and Wang Zhili last March. After its establishment, it planted a total of four crops, and each crop yielded more than before: cotton produced 180 jin of seed cotton per mu, breaking the village's highest record; sweet potatoes averaged 2,560 jin per mu, more than double the yield of the previous year and 41.4% higher than the village average; corn averaged 408 jin per mu, 80% higher than the previous year; and rice averaged 639 jin per mu, 28.6% higher than the previous year, 25% higher than the village average, 18% higher than the best individual farmer in the village, and 16% higher than the best mutual aid team led by Huo Weibing in the village. When digging sweet potatoes, the cooperative members didn't expect so many to come out of the ground. They hadn't enlarged and deepened the sweet potato cellars, so the cellars were too small and shallow to hold them all.

With the increase in crop yields, the income of the cooperative members also increased. Of the twenty cooperative member families, five increased their income by 60% compared to before joining the cooperative, two increased by 40%, two increased by 30%, seven increased by 20%, and the other four increased by about 10%. With the increase in income, not only did seven families pay off their old debts, but they also bought a lot of daily necessities and production tools, and sold 8,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

With such abundant income, the joy of all the cooperative members and their families goes without saying, and the other farmers in the village are extremely envious! Huo Weibing, the leader of a mutual aid team, said to everyone, "We were allocated the same amount of land during the land reform, but look at how much more income the cooperative members have than us!" Not only that, but even farmers from nearby villages came to inquire, "Why can the cooperative produce more grain?"

There is no secret to why the cooperative can produce more grain; the main reason is that the cooperative has more advantages than the mutual aid teams. The cooperative can make the land more abundant and better, and also make people more capable and powerful.

Previously, each family had a small paddy field, the large ones only nine fen, and the small ones only one fen and two li, with the field ridges as boundaries, each managing their own small plot. After the establishment of the cooperative, more than one hundred field ridges were leveled, creating large, new-style rice paddies. The fields were connected into pieces. Not to mention how convenient it is to irrigate and sun the fields, the leveling of the field ridges also added 2.4 mu of land, on which crops can be planted. Calculating at a yield of 600 jin of rice per mu, this can produce an additional 1,440 jin of rice.

Previously, the mutual aid team discussed building a ditch and embankment more than fifty zhang long. Everyone talked at once, arguing back and forth, making it impossible to start construction. After the establishment of the cooperative, the land was pooled as shares, and every piece of land was related to everyone. No one argued about who was losing out or who was taking advantage anymore. With everyone working together, the mountain can be moved, and with more than 280 workdays invested, the ditch and embankment were completed.

Previously, regardless of the soil quality, each family planted whatever they wanted to eat. The twenty families planted a total of nine crops, which was not only troublesome for the people but also wronged the land. After the establishment of the cooperative, they only planted four crops based on what the soil was suitable for. In this way, sweet potatoes were planted in sweet potato fields, cotton was planted in cotton fields, and the harvest was naturally better. For example, cooperative member Yang Yuanhua planted five crops on his 1.7 mu of land the year before last, with a total income of 419,000 yuan. Last year, after changing to planting three crops, his income increased by 117,000 yuan.

Previously, Wang Daan accumulated a lot of fertilizer, and applied 140 jin of soybean cake, 100 jin of cottonseed, and 100 jin of cottonseed cake to his 1.2 mu of land. As a result, some seedlings were "burned" to death, and he only harvested 420 jin of rice. On the other hand, a man named Wang Caili, because he had little fertilizer, planted 1 mu of plain-water seedlings and only harvested 300 jin of rice. After the establishment of the cooperative, it uniformly purchased the manure fertilizer of the cooperative members, and then applied fertilizer reasonably according to the nature of the land and the needs of the crops. In this way, the fertilizer on each mu of land was not too much or too little, and the crops generally increased production, with each mu of land producing more than 600 jin of rice.

Previously, regardless of cotton pruning, topping, or rice field weeding and removing barnyard grass, or livestock drinking water and eating grass, everything had to be worried about and worked hard by everyone. Often, one person would attend to the field but neglect the house, or attend to the house but neglect the field. After the establishment of the cooperative, work was divided according to each person's labor and expertise, with each person holding their own corner. Those who can build beams build beams, those who can build pillars build pillars, and everyone has a use. Xi Zhengyang, a seventy-five-year-old woman who hadn't worked for more than ten years, looked after the children in the nursery after joining the cooperative and was even named a labor model. Similarly, Wang Qunli, a disabled person, used to rely on others to help him cultivate the land, but now he does light work in the cooperative, such as herding cattle and guarding birds, and the grain he receives is much more than before.

Previously, small farmers dared not boldly absorb advanced experience and improve technology, fearing that if they messed up one year, they would not be able to recover for several years. After the establishment of the cooperative, everyone had mutual support and dared to plant rice deeply, plant cotton densely, dare to dry-plant sweet potatoes without waiting for rain, and dare to intercrop corn in cotton and sweet potato fields. As a result, all four crops had a bumper harvest.

The Wang Daan Agricultural Production Cooperative's ability to produce more grain is closely related to the leading role of the Party members and the continuous instructions and assistance from higher levels. For example, when leveling the field ridges, the cooperative members knew it was good to level them, but they couldn't help but feel heartache. Wang Manli, who was in his sixties, couldn't sleep well at night. He said, "I just got the land certificate, and I haven't even learned the soil properties yet, and now I have to 'remove the boundaries'! How can this be!" Cooperative members such as Wang Zhijin also kept chanting that their land was so good, and said things like "Land and wife are not to be given away" and so on. Just when there was a lot of discussion and people were feeling uneasy, Communist Party members Wang Daan and Wang Daren stepped forward and said, "Leveling the field ridges will produce more grain, and it will be easier to use tractors in the future." They leveled their field ridges first. Following them, other farmers also leveled their field ridges. For example, when the cooperative was first established, it did not have good experience in organizing, allocating labor, and evaluating and recording work points. Every morning, everyone led their whole family to the fields to grab work. Regardless of whether the land was large or small, or whether there was a lot or little work, everyone rushed in. Sometimes a small piece of land was crowded with a large group of people, bumping into each other, and they couldn't use their strength. Sometimes the time spent traveling to and from work was more than the time spent working. The cooperative members complained, "If we all go to the fields to grab work, then the children don't need to go to school." In the evening, everyone crowded into the cooperative to evaluate work points, arguing until midnight, and then they didn't have the energy to work the next day. The head of the cooperative, Wang Daan, couldn't sleep well all day and was very worried. At this time, someone from the Santai County Party Committee came and told them to adopt the method of contracting work, dividing the various tasks into work points and contracting them to each team, with the teams comparing each other based on labor, technology, and other conditions, and the cooperative issuing work tickets uniformly. As a result, everyone was full of energy, worked carefully, and studied technology attentively.

The Wang Daan Agricultural Production Cooperative's bumper harvest has paved the way for the farmers in the whole township. The Wang Huili mutual aid team, which had previously collapsed, was reorganized and prepared to transition to an agricultural production cooperative in the future. Several nearby mutual aid teams and individual farmers such as Wang Yunli and Wang Xianli are actively requesting to join the cooperative. Wang Xianli has a 1.2 mu plot of land that is far away from the cooperative, and he has already exchanged it with someone else for a plot of land that is right next to the cooperative. The three mutual aid teams of Li Songwu, Li Tingwei, and Yang Junqi in the Fourth Village have jointly held a meeting to request the establishment of a cooperative. Yang Junqi also said, "If a cooperative is not established here, I will join the Wang Daan Agricultural Production Cooperative." Now, many mutual aid team leaders and members have packed their luggage and dry food and gone to the Wang Daan Agricultural Production Cooperative to learn the skills.

    王达安农业生产合作社多打了粮食
    本报记者　林沫
    两年来，西南各地在互助组的基础上，前前后后试办了五十九个农业生产合作社。合作社一成立，收成一般都比互助组好，比单干农民更好。别的不说，光说一说这个成立不到一年的王达安农业生产合作社。
    王达安农业生产合作社在四川三台县尊德乡第八村，由杨榜元、王志立两个互助组组成，是去年三月成立的。成立之后，一共种了四样庄稼，样样庄稼都打多了：棉花每亩产籽棉一百八十斤，打破全村最高纪录；红苕每亩平均产二千五百六十斤，比前年多产一倍，比全村平均产量高百分之四十一点四；玉米每亩平均产四百零八斤，比前年多百分之八十；稻子每亩平均产六百三十九斤，比前年多百分之二十八点六，比全村平均产量高百分之二十五，比村里最好的单干农民高百分之十八，比村里最好的霍维炳互助组还要高百分之十六。在挖红苕的时候，社员们都没想到会从地里冒出那样多。原先他们没有把红苕窖加大挖深，结果窖小了、浅了，装不下了。
    庄稼打多了，社员的收入跟着也多了。二十家社员，有五家比入社前的收入增加百分之六十，有二家增加百分之四十，有二家增加百分之三十，有七家增加百分之二十，其他四家也增加了百分之十左右。大家收入增多，不仅有七家还清了旧债，而且都买了很多日用百货，生产工具，还卖出余粮八千斤给国家。
    有了这样丰盛的收入，社员们全家大小的欢喜不用提了，村里其他农民也羡慕得了不得！互助组组长霍维炳到处跟人说：“土地改革分的一样多的地，看人家社员的收入比我们多多少！”不光这样，连附近村子的农民也都赶来打听：“为什么合作社能够多打粮食？”
    合作社能够多打粮食，没有别的巧，主要是合作社比互助组具有更多的优越性。合作社能把土地变多变好，把人也变得更有办法有力量了。
    以前，一家一块水田，大的才九分，小的只有一分二厘，以田坎为界，各管各的一小块。合作社成立后，把一百多根田坎平了，做成大块大块的新式秧田。田地连成了片，不说灌水、晒田有多方便，田坎一平，还多出了二亩四分田，上边又可种庄稼。以每亩产稻子六百斤计算，可以多产稻子一千四百四十斤。
    以前，互助组讨论兴修一条五十多丈长的沟堰。大家七嘴八舌，吵过来，吵过去，吵得没法动工。合作社成立后，土地入了股，哪块地都跟自己有关，没有人再吵什么我吃亏、你占便宜了。人齐泰山倒，化了二百八十多个工，就把沟堰修通了。
    以前，不管土质怎样，各家吃啥就要种啥。二十家共种了九样庄稼，不光人麻烦，连土地也受了委屈。合作社成立后，就根据土质适合种啥才种啥，只种了四样庄稼。这样，红苕栽到了红苕地，棉花种到了棉花田，收成当然就好了。拿社员杨元华说，他一亩七分地前年种了五样庄稼，收入共值四十一万九千元，去年改种三样后，收入增加了十一万七千元。
    以前，王达安攒的肥料多，就在一亩二分田上上了豆饼一百四十斤，棉籽一百斤，棉籽枯一百斤，结果有些秧子被“烧”死，只收了稻子四百二十斤。而另外有个名叫王才立的因为肥料少，栽了一亩白水秧，只收了稻子三百斤。合作社成立后，统一收买社员的粪肥，再根据土地的性质、庄稼的需要合理施肥。这样，每亩地上的肥料不致多的太多，少的太少，庄稼就普遍增产了，每亩田都产六百斤以上的稻子。
    以前，不管棉花整枝、摘心，不管稻田除虫、扯稗，不管牲口喝水、吃草，样样事情都要每个人操心费劲，弄得一个人常常是顾了田头，丢了土头，顾了土头，又丢了屋里头。合作社成立后，就按各人的劳力、特长分工，各人各抱一角。会做梁的做梁，会做柱的做柱，人人都有用处。七十五岁的老太婆习正扬，十多年没做过活了，入社后，就在托儿所看娃娃，还被评成劳动模范。再像残废人王群立，以前要靠别人帮忙种地，现在在合作社里做些放牛、守雀鸟等轻活，分到的粮食比以前还多好多。
    以前，小门小院的农民不敢大胆吸收先进经验，改进技术，害怕一年弄糟，几年喘不过气来。合作社成立后，大家互相有了依靠，就敢深栽水稻，密植棉花，就敢不等下雨干种红苕，就敢在棉花、红苕地里串种玉米，结果四样庄稼都丰收了。
    王达安农业生产合作社能够多打粮食，跟党员的带头作用和上级不断的指示、帮助有很大关系。比方在平田坎的时候，社员们明知平了的好，可是总忍不住心痛。六十多岁的王满立闹得晚上睡不好觉，他说：“土地证刚拿到手，土性还没摸熟，就要‘倒界’了，怎么成！”王志金等社员也在嘴里不住念叨，自己的田地多好多好，还说什么“田地老婆不让人”等等。就在这议论纷纷、人心惶惶的时候，共产党员王达安、王达仁挺身出来，一面说：“平了田坎多打粮，以后好使拖拉机”，一面就把自己的田坎先平了。跟着，别的农民也把自己的田坎平了。再比方合作社刚成立的时候，对劳动力的组织、调配和评分记工等没有很好的经验。每天一早，大家领着全家老少跑到田地里抢分。不管地大地小，活多活少，大家一拥而上。有时一小块地挤上一大堆人，碰碰撞撞，有劲也施展不开；有时做活的时间还没跑路的时间多。社员们纷纷反映：“都下地抢分，娃娃就不用上学了。”晚上，大家又挤在社里评分，一吵吵到半夜，第二天没劲干活。弄得社长王达安整天睡不好觉，十分焦愁。正在这个时候，三台县县委会派人来了，叫他们采用包工的办法，把各种活分成工分包给各组，由组内根据劳力、技术等条件互相评比，社再统一发给工票。这样一来，大家劲头足了，干活细致了，学习技术也专心了。
    王达安农业生产合作社多打了粮食，就给全乡农民踩出一条路来了。原先垮了台的王惠立互助组又重新组织起来，准备以后好向农业生产合作社过渡。附近几个互助组和单干农民王云立、王先立等都积极要求入社。王先立有一块一亩二分地，离合作社很远，他已跟别人调了一块跟合作社紧挨着的地。第四村李松务、李挺伟、杨君其等三个互助组已联合开会要求办社，杨君其还说：“这里不办社，我就去参加王达安农业生产合作社。”现在，已有不少互助组长、组员背上行李、干粮到王达安农业生产合作社学本事去了。
