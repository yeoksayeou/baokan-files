Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th — The U.S. side is intensifying preparations for seizing prisoners of war, attempting to collude with special agents mixed in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) camp on January 22nd to tear up the armistice agreement and abduct more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who have not yet been given explanations or applied for repatriation, in order to cover up the miserable failure of their "psychological warfare."
    In order to prevent prisoners of war from taking the opportunity to flee north to the Korean and Chinese side's territory when they are being abducted from the NNSC camps, the U.S. side is building large-scale barbed wire fences, roadblocks, and prisoner of war camps in the area from Dongchang-ri to Munsan. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. "Marine Corps and engineer corps are constructing huge barbed wire fences from Munsan to an area not far south of Namyeong," "huge mobile roadblocks made of welded steel rails and barbed wire have been placed at road intersections to prevent prisoners of war from running onto small roads," and "special precautions have been taken to guard the northern passage to the Bridge of No Return (i.e., the Imjin River Bridge)." "Many tons of barbed wire are arranged on the road to build temporary detention camps." "Now large convoys of trucks are heading north to the Munsan area one after another, each truck carrying a new trailer, and another trailer is placed on top of the trailer." On the highway from Munsan to Dongchang-ri, "work teams are working in the faint winter sunshine to build roadblocks, erect barbed wire fences, and enclose temporary detention camps." The Associated Press also reported that senior U.S. officers have said, "Truck convoys will be waiting for prisoners of war, and ships will also be docked at Incheon Port" in order to transport 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war to Taiwan and hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
    At the same time, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang is also stepping up preparations for the heinous conspiracy to seize prisoners of war. According to Reuters, Syngman Rhee's Minister of National Defense, Sohn Won-il, publicly stated on December 30th last year that he had discussed the conspiracy to seize prisoners of war in Dongchang-ri with Won Yong-duk, the head of Syngman Rhee's special agents, who had abducted 27,000 of our prisoners of war before the armistice agreement was signed. A South Korean source said on the 3rd that the Syngman Rhee army had drafted a plan to abduct Korean People's Army prisoners of war to Daegu and Pohang on January 23rd. Meanwhile, according to International News Service, Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister, Pyun Yung-tai, issued a war threat on December 29th last year, saying that if they were prevented from seizing prisoners of war, "it would be equivalent to resuming the war," and he also threatened the Indian custodial forces to "leave the prisoner of war camps after midnight on January 22nd."
Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th — Under the command of the U.S. side, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang is stepping up its planning for the heinous conspiracy to forcibly seize more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in Dongchang-ri on January 22nd.
    According to International News Service reporter Dennis, Syngman Rhee's puppet and his Prime Minister Baek Doo-jin, Foreign Minister Pyun Yung-tai, Minister of National Defense Sohn Won-il, and others held an "emergency cabinet meeting" on the 4th, deciding that if the Indian custodial forces failed to "release" the prisoners of war by January 22nd, "the South Korean army would release them," and "decided to promote a policy against the Indian forces staying in Korea through a 'voluntary national movement'." After this meeting, Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister, Pyun Yung-tai, immediately issued a war threat in an attempt to put pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial forces. He said, "I can assure you with certainty: if the Indians do not release them on January 23rd, we will definitely use force to get our prisoners of war back."
    At the same time, according to Agence France-Presse, "reliable sources" in Taipei said that the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in the Far East, Hull, will arrive in Taiwan on January 11th to discuss the issue of abducting Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek. The U.S. military units in Korea are also stepping up preparations to assist the Syngman Rhee gang in the conspiracy to forcibly seize prisoners of war. According to International News Service, a spokesman for the U.S. Marine Corps said, "Prisoners of war will be driven out of the prisoner of war camps" and they will be "kept in 'temporary accommodation areas' south of the Imjin River according to the original camp organization." At the same time, the U.S. side has "set up searchlights and installed barbed wire" on the roads through which the prisoners of war are abducted from the prisoner of war camps, and "U.S. Marines will be guarding along the way" when the prisoners of war are forced to move south. According to United Press, the U.S. forces are "building two prisoner of war camps" in order to imprison the abducted prisoners of war.

    美方加紧阴谋活动准备劫夺朝中被俘人员
    【新华社开城四日电】美方正在加紧布置劫夺战俘的准备工作，企图在一月二十二日与混在中立国看管营场里的特务分子里应外合地撕毁停战协定，劫走两万多名尚未听取解释和申请遣返的朝中被俘人员，借以掩饰其“心理战”的悲惨失败。
    美方为了防止战俘在被劫出中立国看管营场时，乘机向北逃到朝中方面的地区来，正在从东场里到汶山的地区内大规模地修建铁丝网、路障和囚禁战俘的营场。据美联社报道，美国“海军陆战队和工兵队正在从汶山到南营以南不远的地区修建巨大的铁丝网栅栏”，“用焊接的钢轨和铁丝网筑成的巨大的可移动的路障已经放在道路的交叉点上，使战俘们不会跑到小路上去”，并且“已经采取了特别预防措施，看守通往自由门桥（按：即临津江桥）的北面过道”。“许多吨的铁丝网排列在路上，用来建筑临时拘留的营场”。“现在已有大队的运送卡车陆续向北开往汶山地区，每辆卡车都带了一辆新拖车，拖车的顶上又放了一辆拖车。”在汶山到东场里的公路上，“一路都有工作队在冬日的淡淡的阳光下劳动，建立路障，架起铁丝网，围起临时拘留营场”。美联社的报道还说，美方的高级军官已经说过，“卡车运输队将要等待战俘，船只也将泊在仁川港”，以便把一万四千名中国人民志愿军被俘人员运往台湾移交给蒋介石匪帮。
    与此同时，李承晚匪帮也正在加紧准备劫夺战俘的罪恶阴谋。据路透社报道，李匪国防部长官孙元一在去年十二月三十日公开说，他已经与在停战协定签订以前劫走二万七千名我方被俘人员的李匪特务头子元容德讨论了劫夺东场里战俘的阴谋。一位南朝鲜人士三日说，李匪军陆军方面已经拟好在一月二十三日把朝鲜人民军被俘人员劫往大邱和浦项的计划。同时，据国际新闻社报道，李匪外务部长官卞荣泰在去年十二月二十九日发出战争恫吓说，如果阻止他们劫走战俘，“那就等于恢复战争”，他还威胁印度看管部队要“在一月二十二日午夜后离开战俘营”。
    【新华社开城五日电】李承晚匪帮在美方指挥之下，正在加紧策划在一月二十二日用武力劫夺东场里两万多名朝中被俘人员的罪恶阴谋。
    据国际新闻社记者杰尼斯报道，李承晚傀儡和他的国务总理白斗镇、外务部长官卞荣泰、国防部长官孙元一等在四日举行了内阁“紧急会议”，决定如果印度看管部队到一月二十二日未能“释放”战俘，“就由韩国军队来释放他们”，并且“决定了通过一种‘自愿的全国运动’，来鼓动反对印度部队留在朝鲜的政策”。在这次会议以后，李匪帮外务部长官卞荣泰立即发出了战争恫吓，企图对中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队施加压力。他说，“我可以肯定地向你保证：如果印度人在一月二十三日不释放他们，我们一定要使用武力来把我们的战俘弄回来。”
    与此同时，据法新社报道，台北的“可靠人士”说，远东美军总司令赫尔将在一月十一日到达台湾，与蒋匪介石商讨把中国人民志愿军被俘人员劫往台湾的问题。在朝鲜的美军部队也正在加紧准备协助李匪帮用武力劫夺战俘的阴谋。据国际新闻社报道，美军海军陆战队的发言人说，“将把战俘从战俘营中驱赶出来”，并且把他们“按照原先的营场编制留在临津江以南的‘临时收容地区’内。”同时，美方已在战俘被劫出战俘营后所经的道路上“设置了探照灯，安下了铁丝网”，并且在战俘被迫向南行动时，沿途还“将有美国海军陆战队在旁看守”。据合众社报道，美方部队正在“修建两座战俘营”，以便囚禁被劫夺出来的战俘。
