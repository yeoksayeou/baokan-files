The agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement in the country made further progress in 1953. According to statistics from November 1953, approximately 47.9 million farm households across the country participated in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations, accounting for 43 percent of the total number of farm households nationwide, an increase of more than 20 percent compared to 1952. In 1953, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives developed to more than 14,000 (plus more than 4,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives established spontaneously by farmers that were not included in the statistics), with more than 273,000 participating farm households, accounting for 0.57 percent of the total number of organized farm households, an increase of more than three times compared to 1952. Farm households participating in year-round mutual aid teams accounted for more than 24 percent of the total number of organized farm households, an increase of more than 21 percent compared to 1952. Other various temporary mutual aid teams accounted for more than 70 percent of the total number of organized farm households.

Looking at the regions separately, the proportion of organized farm households in the total number of farm households in each major administrative region is: Northeast region 75 percent, North China region more than 50 percent, East China region about 50 percent, Northwest region 45 percent, Central South region 30 percent, and Southwest region 40 percent. Among the organized farm households in each major administrative region, the proportion of households participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives is: Northeast region 1.84, North China region 1.89, East China region 0.27, Northwest region 0.21, Central South region 0.078, Southwest region 0.013; the proportion of households participating in year-round mutual aid teams is: Northeast region 33 percent (plus three major seasonal teams accounting for more than 70 percent), North China region 33 percent, East China region more than 35 percent, Northwest region 10 percent, Central South region 14 percent, Southwest region 10 percent; in addition to the farm households participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives and year-round mutual aid teams, the rest are various temporary mutual aid teams. In old liberated areas such as the Northeast and North China, there are an average of three agricultural producers' cooperatives in each district; in Shandong Province and other areas liberated earlier, as well as individual counties where the foundation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement is relatively good even though liberation was later, there is also generally an agricultural producers' cooperative in each district; other areas liberated later have carried out pilot agricultural producers' cooperatives at the prefectural level or in a small number of counties.

In 1953, the common feature of the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement throughout the country was that not only had the number of mutual aid and cooperative organizations increased considerably, but the quality had also greatly improved. In terms of agricultural producers' cooperatives, it is prominently reflected in the fact that the cooperatives run in various places (including many established spontaneously by farmers) are generally successful, the management has been greatly improved, production has increased, and the income of the members has increased. According to surveys in several regions, more than 80 or 90 percent of the agricultural producers' cooperatives run in 1953 were run better and increased production by 10 to 20 percent compared to the average local mutual aid teams, and some increased production by more than 100 percent, while those with similar or lower yields than the local mutual aid teams accounted for a minority. According to a survey of 2,242 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Shanxi Province, 98 percent of the agricultural producers' cooperatives exceeded the output of local mutual aid teams. In terms of mutual aid teams, it is prominently reflected in the fact that formalistic mutual aid teams that existed in name only (i.e., mutual aid in name but actually individual farming) have been greatly reduced, and year-round mutual aid teams have greatly increased. In the North China, Northwest, and Southwest regions, it is estimated that about 10 to 20 percent of the mutual aid teams in 1952 existed in name only, but this type of mutual aid team was greatly reduced last year; in the Central South region, year-round mutual aid teams accounted for just over 9 percent of the organized households in 1952, and increased to 14 percent in 1953. The development and improvement of mutual aid teams have improved and resolved the difficulties encountered by farmers in production to a certain extent, ensuring timely cultivation and increasing production. After farmers in Mi'quan County, Xinjiang Province, joined mutual aid teams, more than 1,400 households solved the difficulty of lacking draught animals, more than 1,300 households solved the difficulty of lacking farm tools, more than 340 households solved the difficulty of lacking seeds, and more than 700 grain-deficient households solved their livelihood difficulties. According to estimates in the Central South region, mutual aid teams generally increased production by about 10 percent compared to individual farmers in 1953. The superiority shown by mutual aid and cooperative organizations in 1953 greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation, and the fact that "individual farming is not as good as mutual aid, and mutual aid is not as good as cooperation" has been generally recognized by farmers.

The reason why the national mutual aid and cooperation movement has achieved these major achievements in the past year is first and foremost because the Party's policies are correct, proving that developing mutual aid and cooperation is the correct path for carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture, and it is indeed necessary for the vast number of farmers to develop production at present; secondly, it is because Party organizations at all levels have promptly corrected the deviations that have occurred in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After correcting the tendency of blind rashness in many regions in 1953, the tendency of laissez-faire was also corrected in some regions, so that the movement embarked on the correct track, ensuring the healthy development of the movement. In 1953, in-depth publicity was carried out throughout the country on the Party's general line during the transition period, which further promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement and prepared good conditions for greater development in 1954.

    农业互助合作运动去年有了进一步发展
    全国近半数农户组织起来
    【本报讯】一九五三年全国农业生产互助合作运动，在党的正确领导下，有了进一步的发展。据一九五三年十一月份的统计，全国参加农业生产互助合作组织的农户约有四千七百九十多万户，占全国农户总数百分之四十三，比一九五二年增加了百分之二十以上。一九五三年农业生产合作社已发展到一万四千多个（还有农民自发建立的四千多个农业生产合作社没有统计在内），参加的农户有二十七万三千多户，占组织起来总农户数百分之零点五七，比一九五二年增加了三倍多。参加常年互助组的农户，约占组织起来农户总数百分之二十四强，比一九五二年增加了百分之二十一强。其他各种临时性互助组占组织起来的农户总数百分之七十以上。
    按地区分别来看，组织起来的农户在各大行政区农户总数中的比例是：东北区百分之七十五，华北区百分之五十多，华东区百分之五十左右，西北区百分之四十五，中南区百分之三十，西南区百分之四十。在各大行政区组织起来的农户中，参加农业生产合作社的户数比例是：东北区一点八四，华北区一点八九，华东区零点二七，西北区零点二一，中南区零点零七八，西南区零点零一三；参加常年互助组的户数比例是：东北区百分之三十三（加上三大季组即占百分之七十以上），华北区百分之三十三，华东区百分之三十五强，西北区百分之十，中南区百分之十四，西南区百分之十；除参加农业生产合作社和常年互助组的农户外，其他都为各种临时互助组。在东北和华北等老解放区，平均每个区已有三个农业生产合作社；在山东省和其他解放较早的地区以及个别解放虽晚但互助合作运动的基础较好的县份，也已大体上每个区有了农业生产合作社；其他晚解放区，在专区一级或少数的县进行了试办农业生产合作社的工作。
    一九五三年，全国各地农业生产互助合作运动发展的共同特点是：互助合作组织不但在数量上有了相当的增加，而且质量方面也有很大的提高。在农业生产合作社方面，突出地表现在各地所办的社（包括不少农民自发建立的在内）一般都是成功的，经营管理有很大改进，生产增长，社员收入增加。据若干地区的调查，在一九五三年所办的农业生产合作社中，百分之八、九十以上都办得较好，并比当地一般互助组增产一成到二成，有的增产到一倍以上，而产量和当地互助组相差不多或不如互助组的则占少数。据山西省二千二百四十二个农业生产合作社的调查，百分之九十八的农业生产合作社都超过了当地互助组的产量。在互助组方面，突出地表现在：有名无实的形式主义的互助组（即名义上是互助，而实际上是单干的组）已大大减少，常年互助组大大增加。华北、西北、西南等地区的互助组，在一九五二年中，估计约有百分之十到二十左右是有名无实的，去年这种互助组就大大减少了；中南区一九五二年常年互助组占组织起来户数百分之九强，一九五三年增加到百分之十四。互助组的发展和提高，在一定程度上改善和解决了各地农民在生产中所遇到的困难，保证了耕作及时，提高了生产。新疆省米泉县农民参加了互助组后，有一千四百多户解决了缺乏耕畜的困难，一千三百多户解决了缺乏农具的困难，三百四十多户解决了缺乏种籽的困难，七百多户缺粮户解决了生活困难。据中南区估计，一九五三年互助组一般比单干农民增产一成左右。一九五三年互助合作组织显示的优越性，大大鼓舞了农民参加互助合作的积极性，“单干不如互助，互助不如合作”这一事实，已为一般农民所公认。
    一年来，全国互助合作运动所以能够取得这些重大的成绩，首先是因为党的政策正确，证明发展互助合作是对农业实行社会主义改造的正确道路，它确为广大农民当前发展生产所必需；其次，是因为各级党组织及时地纠正了互助合作运动中所发生的偏向，一九五三年不少地区纠正盲目冒进的偏向以后，在一些地区又纠正了自流放任的偏向，使运动走上了正确的轨道，保证了运动的健康发展。一九五三年各地对国家在过渡时期的总路线进行了深入的宣传，更加推进了互助合作运动，为一九五四年更大的发展准备了良好的条件。
