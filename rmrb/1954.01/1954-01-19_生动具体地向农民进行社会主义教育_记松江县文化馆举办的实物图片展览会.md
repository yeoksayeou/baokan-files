    Vivid and Concrete Socialist Education for Peasants
    – On the Material and Pictorial Exhibition Held by the Songjiang County Cultural Center
  　Gong Yuesu
    Under the direct leadership of the Songjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Songjiang County Cultural Center in Jiangsu Province held a material and pictorial exhibition to conduct propaganda and education on the general line among village cadres and peasant masses.
    The first part of the exhibition was “Helping Peasants Calculate Three Accounts.” First, it helped the audience understand that the Communist Party brings a happy life to the people. Through many objects and charts, people learned about the significant changes in the political, economic, and cultural lives of Songjiang peasants under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government in the past four years. The exhibition displayed an old cotton-padded coat that Lu Sanguan, a peasant in Changlou Township, wore for twenty-one years as a hired laborer before liberation, and a new cotton-padded coat made in 1952, vividly illustrating the circumstances of the peasants before and after their liberation. A grassroots cadre from Caojing District said with emotion after seeing it: "If I hadn't seen it, I would have forgotten that it was common to wear a cotton coat for ten or twenty years in the past!" The exhibition also displayed two bowls, one for porridge and one for vegetables, which told the story of the gradual improvement of the lives of the peasants in Luo Jiazhai Village, Lujing Township, Fengjing District. The village had a total of 180 peasant households, who were so poor in the past that they almost all lived on porridge. In 1950, there were 120 bowls for porridge in the village, 110 in 1951, 90 in 1952, and only 12 porridge bowls left in 1953, with the rest being used for vegetables. In addition, there were 65 various pens on the table, all borrowed one by one from the peasants of Yangjia Village, Zhongqiao Township, Chengxi District. Before liberation, only the landlord Yang Shicheng had two pens in the entire village, but now the peasants have 65, each labeled with the owner's name. Zheng Jianchun, chairman of the farmers' association of Songjiabin Village, Xinlong Township, Sijing District, said after seeing it: "If we collect the pens in our village, we can get dozens of them!"
    What benefits does national industrialization bring to the peasants? The exhibition displayed many industrial products needed by the peasants on one side, and agricultural products such as rice and wheat on the other. People could see from the prices of these industrial and agricultural products that the prices of industrial products were decreasing year by year, while the prices of agricultural products were being adjusted year by year. In the middle of a large round table was placed one dou of rice, surrounded by peasants' daily necessities, illustrating that before liberation, one dou of rice could only be exchanged for ten bars of soap, while after liberation, one dou of rice could be exchanged for fourteen bars of soap; before liberation, one dou of rice could only be exchanged for three jin of tung oil, while after liberation, it could be exchanged for five jin and two liang; before liberation, one dou of rice could only be exchanged for three jin of brown sugar, while after liberation, it could be exchanged for six jin. Sun Genbao, secretary of the Tiankun District Committee, said after seeing it: "In the past, we only generally knew the benefits of national construction, but after seeing this comparison, we have a deeper understanding!"
    Regarding mutual aid and cooperation, the exhibition used pictures and objects to show its benefits. Photos of the Chen Yongkang mutual aid team uniting to increase production, drawings of the Shen Jinyun agricultural production cooperative producing more grain, and charts showing the state's support for Songjiang peasants in terms of agricultural loans, water conservancy, etc., vividly explained to the peasants that only by organizing and taking the path of mutual aid and cooperation can the peasants become prosperous together.
    The second part of the exhibition was "The Happy Life of Soviet Peasants." It focused on using pictures to introduce how Soviet peasants, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, overcame various difficulties, used machines to produce after the realization of national industrialization, and obtained a happy and joyful life. A water pump and a tractor model were displayed here, attracting visiting village cadres. Many people squatted down to touch the body and outlet pipe of the water pump. Li Jinsheng, a cadre from Chedun Township, said after seeing it: "This small water pump only burns 5,000 yuan worth of diesel per hour, but it can irrigate 32 mu of land; we now use cattle to irrigate, and we can't even irrigate one mu of land in an hour. One water pump can replace 32 oxen!" A cadre from Zhuangchang Township said: "Peasants use foot-operated waterwheels even slower. People really can't compare with machines." Wang Menglai, the director of the Changxing Agricultural Production Cooperative, said: "After seeing the machines produced by the factory, I believe that we can also use machines to cultivate the land like the Soviet Union in the future. In a few years, our agricultural production cooperative will also be able to use water pumps." After seeing the tractor model, Chu Jinxiang, a cadre from Xinjing Township, said: "A tractor can cultivate three to four hundred mu of land a day. If we organize in our township and help national industrialization, one tractor will be enough in the future, which will save a lot of effort."
    In the section "In Order to Build Socialism, Resolutely Stop the Destructive Activities of Illegal Merchants," it vividly exposed the acts of grain speculation, deceiving peasants, and undermining national economic construction by local and foreign merchants. After seeing it, a cadre from Maqiao Township said: "The illegal merchants in Tinglin Town are really bad to the core. They sell sesame shells mixed with bran, which causes the pigs to have diarrhea. The illegal merchants only care about making money and do not care about the interests of the peasants." When a cadre from Fanjing Township saw a picture of a merchant in Xuzhou hoarding 200,000 jin of soybeans, which caused a temporary shortage of edible oil in the market, he said: "One merchant hoarded 200,000 jin of soybeans. If you calculate it for the whole country, it's really terrible. We must strengthen market management and strictly prohibit merchants from speculation." Shen Zhiliang, production and construction assistant of Caojing District, criticized his own capitalist ideas at a meeting after seeing the exhibition and studying and discussing it.
    The fourth part was "Everything is for Implementing the General Line." It used pictures and objects to educate peasants to do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation to produce more grain, sell surplus grain to the state, and support industrial construction. For example, regarding the problem of insufficient pig feed supply, many charts were used to illustrate that this was because production had developed and more pigs were being raised. For example, in Beixin Village, Tinglin District, the whole village raised 69 pigs in 1949, but 248 pigs in 1953, an increase of 2.6 times in four years. The village has 1,242 mu of rice fields, with an average yield of 450 jin of grain per mu, totaling 558,900 jin, which can produce more than 40,000 jin of pure bran. However, the 248 pigs in the village need more than 290,000 jin of bran for the whole year, with a shortage of more than 240,000 jin. The county cooperative has already transported a large amount of pig bran from Qingdao, Jinan, Hankou and other places, but it is still not enough. What should be done? On the second row of benches were displayed more than 20 kinds of wild vegetables, wild grasses, melons and other pig feed substitutes found by the peasants, and two kinds of mixed bran (half pure bran and half rice husks) from the cooperative, next to a large white pig fed with mixed bran. It tells everyone that as long as they use their brains and use substitutes, coupled with the strong supply of the cooperative, the pig feed difficulties can be solved. Wang Menglai from Changlou Township said: "Originally, I didn't believe that mixed bran could be used to feed pigs, but after seeing the real thing at this exhibition, I believe it!"
    Finally, the meeting also used several large-scale propaganda posters to promote the benefits of selling grain to the state for the country and the peasants, and the significance of doing a good job in mutual aid and cooperation and producing more grain to support national construction.
    The general line propaganda exhibition held by the Songjiang County Cultural Center was welcomed by village cadres. The Cultural Center summarized the advantages and disadvantages of this exhibition, and will universally promote this method of small-scale material and pictorial exhibitions in rural propaganda work under the unified leadership of the county and districts in the future.

    生动具体地向农民进行社会主义教育
    ——记松江县文化馆举办的实物图片展览会
  　龚樾苏
    江苏省松江县文化馆在中共松江县委的直接领导下，举办了一个实物图片展览会，向村干部和农民群众进行了总路线的宣传教育。
    展览会的第一部分是“帮农民算三笔账”。它首先使观众认识给人民带来幸福生活的是共产党。人们通过许多实物、图表，了解了四年来松江农民在党和人民政府的领导下，在政治、经济、文化生活上的显著变化。展览会陈列了长溇乡农民陆三官在解放前做雇工时穿了二十一年的一件破棉袄和一九五二年做的一件新棉袄，生动地说明了农民翻身前后的境遇。漕泾区一个基层干部看后感动地说：“不看倒也忘了，在过去一件棉衣穿一、二十年的事真多哩！”在展览会上还陈列了两只钵头，一只盛粥、一只盛菜，这是说的枫泾区路泾乡罗家?村农民生活日渐改善的事。该村共有一百八十户农民，过去穷得几乎全部吃粥度日。一九五○年全村盛粥的钵头有一百二十只，一九五一年一百十只，一九五二年九十只，而一九五三年只剩下了十二只粥钵头，其余的都变成盛菜的了。另外，在桌上还摆着各色钢笔六十五支，这些钢笔都是从城西区中桥乡杨家村农民那里一支支借来的。解放前全村只有地主杨士成有两支钢笔，现在农民却有了六十五支，上面都贴着笔主的姓名。泗泾区新龙乡宋家滨村农会主任郑鉴春看了后说：“我们村里的钢笔，收收也有好几十支哩！”
    国家工业化究竟给农民带来什么好处呢？展览会一面陈列着很多农民需用的工业品，另一面摆着稻谷、麦子等农产品。人们从这些工农业产品的标价上可以看出，工业产品的价格是在逐年下降，而农产品的价格则在逐年调整。在一张大圆桌的中间放着一斗米，周围摆着农民的日用品，说明解放前一斗米只能换取十块肥皂，解放后一斗米能换到十四块肥皂；桐油解放前一斗米只能换到三斤，解放后就能换到五斤二两；红糖解放前一斗米只能换到三斤，解放后就能换到六斤。天昆区委孙根宝同志看后说：“过去我们只是笼统地晓得国家建设的好处，看了这个对比，才体会深哩！”
    关于互助合作，展览会用图片、实物表现了它的好处。陈永康互助组团结起来提高产量的照片，沈金云农业生产合作社多打粮食的图画和国家对松江农民在农贷、水利等方面的支持的图表，生动地向农民说明，只有组织起来，走互助合作的道路，才能使农民大家富裕起来。
    展览会的第二部分是“苏联农民的幸福生活”。着重用图片介绍了苏联农民在斯大林同志领导下克服了各种困难，在实现了国家工业化后，使用机器生产，获得了幸福愉快生活。这里陈列着一架抽水机和一台拖拉机模型，它们吸引了参观的村干部。很多人蹲下来抚摸抽水机的机身、出水管。车墩乡干部李金生看后说：“这架小抽水机一小时只烧五千元的柴油，可打三十二亩田的水；我们现在用牛打水，一小时内连一亩地也打不到。一架抽水机能顶上三十二条耕牛哩！”庄长乡干部说：“农民用脚踏水车更慢了，真是人比机器没比头。”长兴农业生产合作社社长王梦来说：“看了工厂生产的机器，我相信将来也能像苏联一样用机器种田。几年后，我们农业生产合作社也能使用抽水机。”新泾乡干部褚锦祥看了拖拉机模型后说：“拖拉机一天能耕三、四百亩地，我们乡里如果组织起来，帮助国家工业化，将来只要一台拖拉机就够了，多省力。”
    在“为了建设社会主义，坚决制止不法奸商的破坏活动”部分中，形象地揭发了本县及外地奸商进行粮食投机、欺诈农民、破坏国家经济建设的行为。马桥乡干部看了以后说：“亭林镇上的奸商真坏透了，拿芝麻壳混在糠里出卖，猪吃了便泻肚。奸商只顾赚钱，不顾农民的利益。”范泾乡干部从一幅画上看到徐州一个奸商囤积黄豆二十万斤，使市场上食油一度缺乏的情景时，就说：“一个奸商就囤积了二十万斤黄豆，全国算算真不得了，非加强市场管理、严禁奸商投机不可。”漕泾区生产建设助理员沈志良看了展览会，经过学习讨论后，在大会上批判了自己的资本主义思想。
    第四部分是“一切为了贯彻总路线”。用图片实物教育农民搞好互助合作多打粮食，将余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设。例如猪食不够供应的问题，用很多图表说明这是因为生产发展了，猪养得多了。像亭林区北新村一九四九年全村养猪六十九只，一九五三年却养了二百四十八只，四年中增加二点六倍。而该村有稻田一千二百四十二亩，每亩平均产谷四百五十斤，共五十五万八千九百斤，可出清糠四万多斤，而该村二百四十八只猪全年需糠二十九万多斤，还缺二十四万多斤，县合作社已经从青岛、济南、汉口等地运来大批猪糠，但仍不够供应。怎么办呢？在第二排长凳上就陈列着农民找出来的二十多种野菜、野草、瓜类等猪食代用品，和合作总社的两种混合糠（一半清糠，一半砻糠），旁边还有一只用混合糠喂养的大白猪。告诉大家只要多动脑筋，应用代替品，加上合作社大力的供应，猪食困难是可以解决的。长溇乡王梦来说：“本来我听到用混合糠喂猪，总有些不相信，这次展览会上看到真的很好，才相信啦！”
    最后会上还用几幅大型宣传画，宣传了卖粮食给国家对国家对农民的好处，和搞好互助合作、多打粮食支援国家建设的意义。
    松江县文化馆举办的总路线宣传展览会，受到了村干部的欢迎。文化馆总结了这次展览会的优缺点，将来在县区统一领导下，在农村宣传工作中普遍推广这种小型实物图片展览的方法。
