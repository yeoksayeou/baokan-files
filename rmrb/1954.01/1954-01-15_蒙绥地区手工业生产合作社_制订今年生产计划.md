    Handcraft Production Cooperatives in the Mengsui Region
    Formulate This Year's Production Plan
    More than 110 handicraft production cooperatives and preparatory societies in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province have formulated this year's production plans, with the total production value expected to double compared to 1953.
    In 1953, the Mengsui region had a total of 74 various handicraft production cooperatives, with more than 2,000 members, most of whom were carpenters, blacksmiths, and leatherworkers manufacturing agricultural production tools. Handicraft workers in various places have been actively requesting to establish cooperatives, and there are now 38 units that meet the conditions for establishing cooperatives and have organized preparatory societies. The various products produced by the handicraft production cooperatives last year strongly supported local agricultural and pastoral production. Last year, carpenter and blacksmith cooperatives in various regions produced more than 239,100 pieces of various large and small farm tools, and more than 1,600 carts. Handicraft production cooperatives in various places have developed greatly due to the assistance of state-owned enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in terms of raw material supply and product sales. The Tongliao County Carpenter Cooperative and the four cooperatives including the Ulanhot City Carpenter Cooperative in Inner Mongolia accumulated 680 million yuan in capital last year alone; some carpenter production cooperatives in Suiyuan Province used the accumulated capital to purchase equipment such as circular saws to improve production.
    In order to meet the material needs of the local people of all ethnic groups, the handicraft production cooperatives and preparatory societies in the Mengsui region have formulated this year's production plans, in which the plan to produce more than 500,000 pieces of farm tools and more than 2,700 carts just to meet the production needs of farmers.

    蒙绥地区手工业生产合作社
    制订今年生产计划
    内蒙古自治区和绥远省的一百一十多个手工业生产合作社及筹备社，制订了今年的生产计划，生产总值将比一九五三年增加一倍。
    蒙绥地区一九五三年共有各种手工业生产合作社七十四个，社员两千多人，其中大多是制造农业生产工具的木工、铁工以及皮革社。各地手工业者纷纷要求建社，现在已有三十八个合乎办社条件的单位，组织了筹备社。各手工业生产合作社去年生产的各种产品，曾有力地支援了当地的农牧业生产。去年各地的木工和铁工社，生产了各种大小农具二十三万九千一百多件，大车一千六百多辆。各地手工业生产合作社，因为得到国营企业和各级供销合作社在原料供应和产品推销等方面的扶助，有了很大发展。内蒙古通辽县木工合作社和乌兰浩特市木工等四个社，去年一年就积累了资金六亿八千万元；绥远省有的木工生产合作社把积累的资金，购买了盘锯等器械，提高了生产。
    蒙绥地区各手工业生产合作社和筹备社，为了满足当地各族人民的物质需要，已制订了今年的生产计划，其中仅供应农民生产需要方面，就计划生产农具五十多万件，和二千七百多辆大车。各木工和铁工社并准备增加修配农具和大车等业务。
