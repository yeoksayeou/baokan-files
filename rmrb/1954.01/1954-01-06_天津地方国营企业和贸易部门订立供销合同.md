    To ensure the implementation of industrial production and trade plans, and to properly arrange the production and market supply work of local state-owned enterprises in the first quarter of this year, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee convened relevant local state-owned industrial, state-owned trading companies, and cooperatives to study and resolve the balance and integration of supply, production, and sales of 49 major industrial products, such as wires, cables, towels, socks, and corduroy. Except for products allocated and distributed by the central government, supply, production, and sales contracts have been signed for 47 products through consultations at the meeting. The contracts signed by the factories under the local state-owned industrial bureau account for 88.43 percent of the commodity output value of its non-state-allocated products in the first quarter. Among them, full-year supply, production, and sales contracts have been signed for 11 products.

    The Tianjin Municipal Financial and Economic Committee made full preparations before organizing this work. It first formulated a plan for carrying out the work and raised the issues to be resolved in the supply, production, and sales of relevant products. In the consultation work, it also implemented the principle of division of labor between production and sales and the spirit of trade serving production, and therefore achieved great results. Through this joint consultation between trade and industrial departments, most of the products of local state-owned industry in the first quarter of this year have been underwritten by state-owned companies and cooperatives, and supply, production, and sales contracts for the first quarter or the entire year have been signed. After consultation, some seasonal products have generally achieved balanced production. Some products that originally lacked raw materials have also been resolved in a timely and appropriate manner through the meeting, providing a strong guarantee for the completion of the production plan.

    In terms of trade, the sources of goods have been further expanded due to the underwriting of products that had never been underwritten in the past, such as welding machines, asbestos products, crucibles, oil felt, paint, adhesive boards, Ajinomoto, and batteries, which in turn expanded the proportion of state-owned industrial products operated by trade companies, creating favorable conditions for ensuring market supply and completing trade plans.

    At the meeting, the trade departments, based on market conditions, put forward many suggestions for improving production to the production departments. The industrial departments accepted the suggestions of the trade departments and decided to improve production, reduce costs and prices as much as possible. This allows product quality, specifications, and prices to further meet market needs.

    Through the above work, the erroneous thinking of some cadres in the industrial departments who "are willing to sell popular goods themselves to get more profits" and of some cadres in the trade departments who "overestimate commodity circulation costs and are unwilling to underwrite and operate products that are not easy to sell and store" has been further criticized, the overall concept of cadres has been strengthened, so that agreements can be reached smoothly and quickly, and the strength of the state-owned economy can be unified and strengthened.

    天津地方国营企业和贸易部门订立供销合同
    天津市人民政府财经委员会为了保证工业生产、贸易计划的贯彻执行，妥善安排地方国营企业今年第一季度生产和市场供应工作，曾召集各有关地方国营工业、国营贸易公司及合作社等部门研究解决了电线、电缆、毛巾、袜子、甬子绒等四十九种主要工业产品的供、产、销平衡和结合的问题。除由中央调拨分配的产品外，已有四十七种产品经过会议协商订立了供、产、销合同，地方国营工业局所属各厂所订合同，占其第一季度非国家分配的产品的商品产值的百分之八十八点四三，其中有十一种产品并订立了全年的供产销合同。
    天津市财经委员会在组织这项工作时，事前曾作了充分的准备，首先制订了工作进行的方案，提出了各有关产品供、产、销中要解决的问题。在协商工作中，又贯彻了产销分工的原则和贸易为生产服务的精神，因而得到很大成绩。通过这次贸易和工业部门的共同协商，地方国营工业今年第一季度的产品，绝大部分已为国营公司和合作社包销下来，并签订了第一季度的或全年的供、产、销合同。有些季节性的产品，经过协商，一般地作到了均衡生产，有些原来原料不足的产品，通过会议也都得到了及时和适当的解决，给生产计划的完成提供了有力的保证。
    在贸易方面，由于通过会议包销了过去从未包销过的产品如电焊机、石棉制品、坩锅、油毡、油漆、粘板、味之素、电池等，因而进一步扩大了货源，扩大了贸易公司经营国营工业产品的比重，为保证市场供应，完成贸易计划创造了有利条件。
    在会上，贸易部门根据市场情况，对生产部门提出了许多改进生产的意见。工业部门接受了贸易部门的建议，并决定尽可能地改进生产，降低成本、价格等。这就使产品质量、规格、价格可以进一步适合市场的需要。
    通过以上工作，也进一步批判了工业部门中某些干部存在的“热货愿自销多得利润”，和贸易部门某些干部中的“过高地计算商品流转费用，不愿包销和经营不易推销和不易保管的产品”等错误思想，加强了干部的整体观念，从而能顺利地迅速地达成了协议，统一和壮大了国营经济的力量。
