    Northeast Region's Cadres at All Levels Deeply Study the General Line
    [This dispatch] Northeast China region has nearly 600,000 cadres participating in the study of the general line. This includes cadres who originally participated in theoretical studies, cadres who participated in cultural studies, cadres from leading organs above the county level, and cadres from districts and villages. The vast majority of cadres have received profound education in their studies.
    In the in-depth development of the general line study, the Party committees at all levels in the Northeast Region attach importance to the leadership of the study. The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a symposium on theoretical education work in the Northeast Region at the end of October last year, focusing on the study of the general line. At the end of November last year, the Northeast Bureau issued "Instructions on Further Strengthening the Study and Propaganda of the Party's General Line and General Task in the Transition Period and Improving the Leadership Level of Party Committees at All Levels." Responsible cadres from the Northeast Bureau's Finance and Economics Department, Rural Work Department, Organization Department, Propaganda Department, and other departments have all made reports based on the spirit of the general line and in light of the work of their respective departments to inspire cadres to link their thoughts and work to study. Leading cadres from the first-level financial and economic organs in the Northeast Region seriously studied the implementation of various financial and economic policies in their studies. Cadres of the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee proposed in their studies that they should deeply understand the overall thinking and clearly establish the overall view of everything starting from the whole. Leading cadres of the Northeast Commercial Bureau studied the role and tasks of commercial work during the transition period. Leading cadres of the Northeast Finance Bureau studied how taxation should adapt to the needs of socialist industry, state capitalist economy, cooperative economy, and mutual assistance and cooperation development; how fiscal policy should adapt to the needs of accumulating funds for national industrialization.
    Responsible cadres from the Party committees and government departments of various provinces and cities in the Northeast Region, in addition to seriously participating in the study themselves, also paid attention to guiding the vast number of cadres to conduct in-depth study in connection with their thoughts and work. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the CPC emphasized combining the study of the general line with summarizing the work of 1953 and the past four years, as well as preparing for the upcoming provincial party congress this spring, so that the study of the general line is closely linked to practical work. The Jilin Provincial Committee also stipulated that responsible cadres of various departments must, under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory and the spirit of the general line, summarize the work of 1953 and the past four years from the perspective of the province's work, first study and discuss it within their own departments, then further discuss it through senior study groups, and then report to all cadres, or to cadres of relevant departments, or at various relevant work meetings. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the CPC called on all party members and cadres in the city to conduct in-depth study in connection with their thoughts and work. Leading cadres of the first-level party and government departments in Shenyang studied various tasks in the city according to several topics, based on the spirit of the general line, to make ideological preparations for the upcoming professional meetings and inspection work. The Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee of the CPC also proposed that the study should be combined with the summary of the work of 1953 and the past four years and the preparation for the upcoming municipal party congress this spring. In order to guide cadres throughout the city to conduct study in connection with their thoughts and work, the Propaganda Department of the Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee focused on the bank, focusing on summarizing the experience of the financial and economic work departments in studying the general line in conjunction with inspection work, and paid attention to correcting the deviations of not seriously studying the general line, isolating inspection work, and studying documents in a general way without linking them to reality.
    The Party committees of various factories and mines and counties in the Northeast Region also attached great importance to the leadership of the general line study. For example, the Party Committee of the Shenyang Smelter formed a core study group of leading cadres in the factory, and in the study, raised the current problems in the factory's work to the height of the general line to understand them. Among the responsible cadres, the main focus was on checking the implementation of the policy of socialist industrialization, as well as the issues of relying on the working class's ideology, political work, and the combination of economic work. The various study groups at all levels in most counties (cities) in the Northeast Region are also seriously studying the general line. The Ning'an County Committee of the CPC in Songjiang Province also adopted forms such as centralized study in the county, systematic explanation in separate areas, and the county party committee going to the countryside to combine work with making reports to help district cadres deeply study the general line.

    东北区各级干部深入学习总路线
    【本报讯】东北全区有将近六十万名干部参加了总路线的学习。其中包括原参加理论学习的干部、参加文化学习的干部、县以上领导机关的干部和区村干部。广大干部在学习中都受到了深刻的教育。
    在深入开展总路线学习中，东北区各级党委重视对学习的领导。中共中央东北局宣传部在去年十月末召开了东北区理论教育工作座谈会，着重研究总路线的学习问题。去年十一月底东北局又发出“关于进一步加强学习和宣传党在过渡时期的总路线总任务，提高各级党委领导水平的指示”。东北局财经工作部、农村工作部、组织部、宣传部等部的负责干部，都根据总路线的精神，结合本部门工作情况作了报告，以启发干部联系思想和工作进行学习。东北一级财经机关的领导干部，在学习中认真研究了各项财经工作政策的执行情况。东北财政经济委员会干部在学习中提出要深刻领会整体思想，明确树立一切从整体出发的全局观点。东北商业管理局的领导干部研究了商业工作在过渡时期的作用和任务。东北财政局的领导干部研究了税收如何适应社会主义工业、国家资本主义经济、合作经济及互助合作发展的需要；财政政策如何适应为国家工业化积累资金的需要。
    东北区各省市党委及政府部门的负责干部，除自己认真参加学习外，并注意引导广大干部联系思想和工作进行深入学习。中共吉林省委强调把总路线学习与总结一九五三年及四年来的工作，以及准备今春召开全省党代表大会的工作结合起来，使总路线的学习密切联系实际工作。吉林省委还规定，各部门负责干部必须在马克思列宁主义理论与总路线精神指导下，从本省工作情况出发，按专题总结一九五三年和四年来的工作，首先在本部门研究讨论，再经高级学习组进一步讨论，然后向全体干部，或向有关部门的干部，或在各种有关的工作会议上作报告。中共沈阳市委号召全市党员、干部深入地联系思想和工作进行学习。沈阳市一级党和政府部门的负责干部在学习中按若干专题，根据总路线精神，研究全市各项工作，为即将召开的专业会议、检查工作做好思想准备。中共旅大市委也提出使学习和总结一九五三年和四年来工作及准备今春全市党代表大会工作结合起来。旅大市委宣传部为了指导全市干部联系思想和工作进行学习，以银行为重点，着重总结了财经工作部门学习总路线结合检查工作的经验，并注意纠正了不认真学习总路线、孤立检查工作和泛泛地学习文件不联系实际的偏向。
    东北区各厂矿及各县的党委也很重视对总路线学习的领导。如沈阳冶炼厂党委将厂内领导干部组成了学习核心组，在学习中，把厂内当前工作中的问题提到总路线的高度上来认识。在负责干部中主要检查对社会主义工业化方针的执行情况以及依靠工人阶级思想、政治工作与经济工作相结合等问题。东北区各省多数县（市）的各级学习组也都在认真学习总路线。中共松江省宁安县委并采取集中到县学习、分片系统讲解与县委下乡结合工作作报告等形式，帮助区干部深入学习总路线。
