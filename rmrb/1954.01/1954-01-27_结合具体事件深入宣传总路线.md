　　Deepen the Propaganda of the General Line by Combining Specific Events

Since December 31st of last year, the Heilongjiang Daily, in conjunction with the propaganda of the general line, has conducted continuous exposure and criticism of the incident of the local state-owned Xinhua Glass Instrument Factory refusing to produce kerosene lamp parts. In October last year, the Heilongjiang Daily received a letter from a reader reflecting the lack of kerosene lamp covers in rural areas, which affected the lives of farmers. The newspaper immediately sent reporters to the Heilongjiang Provincial Coal Industry Building Materials Company to investigate. The Coal Building Company stated that the lack of lamp covers in rural areas was due to the refusal of the Xinhua Glass Instrument Factory to produce them. The newspaper then sent reporters to the Xinhua Glass Instrument Factory to investigate. The results of the investigation proved that the shortage of kerosene lamp parts in rural areas was indeed due to the factory's refusal to produce them. The reason for the factory's refusal to produce was that the former factory director Zhao Haiyan's understanding of the principles of local state-owned industry was not clear, and there were capitalist management ideas.

Producing according to the national plan and the needs of urban and rural people is the fundamental principle of local state-owned industry. However, Zhao Haiyan, under the control of individualistic thinking of "being praised for completing the output value" and capitalist management thinking of "managing production but not caring about use," opposed the completion of the output value plan to the needs of the people. The Xinhua Glass Instrument Factory under his leadership, on the one hand, one-sidedly pursued high-output value products, over-planning and mass production of difficult-to-sell hanging balls, syringes, etc.; on the other hand, ignoring the needs of the people, repeatedly refused to produce hundreds of thousands of kerosene lamp parts, large ink bottles, large soy sauce bottles and other products stipulated in the national plan and urgently needed by the local masses. This caused a serious out-of-stock phenomenon of kerosene lamp parts and other products in the market. For example, farmers in seven counties, including Qinggang, Tailai, and Suihua, could not buy kerosene lamp parts everywhere. 90% of the covered kerosene lamps in the Yi'an Sixth District were idle because they could not buy lamp covers. An old woman in a rural area of Tailai County traveled a long way to the Xinhua Glass Instrument Factory to buy kerosene lamps because she could not buy them locally, but she could not buy them either. Before leaving, she said disappointedly: "You are the only glass factory in Heilongjiang Province. If you don't make lamp pots, what can we use to light kerosene lamps?" Similarly, because the factory refused to produce large bottles, the Qiqihar Flour Mill could not supply the soy sauce needed in the market in time.

The erroneous practice of the Xinhua Glass Instrument Factory refusing to produce kerosene lamp parts obviously violated the fundamental principle of local state-owned industry to produce and serve the people's livelihood, and thus deviated from the track of the general line. Although such serious neglect of the people's needs is an isolated phenomenon in the local state-owned industry of Heilongjiang Province, the erroneous thinking reflected by this factory's erroneous practice is universal. That is: the lack of the concept of serving the national construction and the production and life of the people, the low quality of products, the failure to actively increase varieties according to the needs and possibilities of the people, the neglect of economic accounting, the neglect of production and sales balance, or the one-sided pursuit of profits, deceiving users, and so on. Therefore, the Heilongjiang Daily not only prominently reported this incident, calling on local enterprises to learn from this incident, but also launched a criticism against capitalist management thinking centered on this incident. This criticism was also supported by the local party committee. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all local state-owned factories in the province to combine the study of the general line and the discussion of the 1954 plan, and to conduct a study on the principles and tasks of local state-owned industry and a review of management work in connection with the Xinhua Glass Instrument Factory incident.

The Heilongjiang Daily combines the propaganda of the general line, focuses on the common problems in the actual work of the local area, and selects typical examples to carry out ideological criticism, which can not only effectively promote the current work, but also deepen the propaganda of the general line.

　　结合具体事件深入宣传总路线
    从去年十二月三十一日以来，黑龙江日报结合总路线的宣传，对地方国营新华玻璃器械厂拒绝生产煤油灯器的事件，进行了连续的揭发和批判。去年十月黑龙江日报曾收到读者来信，反映农村中缺乏煤油灯罩，影响农民的生活。该报即派记者到黑龙江省煤业建筑器材公司调查。煤建公司提出农村中缺乏灯罩是因为新华玻璃器械厂拒绝生产。该报又派记者去新华玻璃器械厂调查。调查结果证明，农村中一度缺乏煤油灯器确实是由于该厂拒绝生产所致。而该厂所以拒绝生产，又是由于前任厂长赵海燕对地方国营工业的方针认识不明确，存在着资本主义的经营思想。
    根据国家计划和城乡人民需要进行生产，这是地方国营工业的根本方针。可是赵海燕却在“完成产值能受表扬”的个人主义思想和“管产不管用”的资本主义经营思想的支配下，把完成产值计划和人民需要对立起来。他所领导的新华玻璃器械厂，一方面片面追求高产值的产品，超计划地大量生产销售困难的吊球、注射器等；另一方面，不顾人民的需要，一再拒绝生产国家计划中规定的而又为当地群众所迫切需要的数十万个煤油灯器、大墨水瓶、大酱油瓶等产品。这就造成了市场上煤油灯器等产品的严重脱销现象。如青岗、泰来、绥化等七县农民，到处都买不到煤油灯器，依安六区农民有百分之九十的带罩煤油灯都因为买不到灯罩而闲起来了。泰来县农村有一位老大娘因为当地买不到煤油灯，特地远路赶到新华玻璃器械厂来买，可是也买不到。她临走时失望地说：“黑龙江省只有你们一个玻璃厂，你们不做灯壶，叫我们用啥点煤油灯呢？”同样，由于该厂不肯生产大瓶子，致使齐齐哈尔制粉厂不能及时供应市场上所需要的酱油。
    新华玻璃器械厂拒绝生产煤油灯器的错误作法，显然违背了地方国营工业为人民生产、生活服务的根本方针，从而也就离开了总路线的轨道。像该厂这样严重忽视人民需要的事情在黑龙江省地方国营工业中虽然是个别现象，但该厂这种错误作法所反映出来的错误思想，却是带有普遍性的。这就是：缺乏为国家建设、为人民生产和生活服务的观念，产品质量低劣，不积极根据人民需要和可能增加品种，忽视经济核算，忽视产销平衡，或者片面追逐利润，欺弄用户，等等。因此黑龙江日报不仅突出地报道了这一事件，号召地方企业接受这一事件的教训，并且以这一事件为中心展开了反对资本主义经营思想的批判。这一批判并得到当地党委的支持。中共黑龙江省委指示全省地方国营工厂，要结合总路线的学习和对一九五四年计划的讨论，联系新华玻璃器械厂事件，进行一次关于地方国营工业方针与任务的学习和经营管理工作的检查。
    黑龙江日报结合总路线的宣传，针对当地实际工作中带有普遍性的问题，选择典型的事例来开展思想批判，这就不仅能够有力地推动当前工作，而且可以使总路线的宣传深入一步。　（万春）
