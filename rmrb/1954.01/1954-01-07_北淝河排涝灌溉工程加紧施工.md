    Construction of the North Fei River Drainage and Irrigation Project is Being Accelerated
    The North Fei River Drainage and Irrigation Project in Anhui Province is undergoing intense winter construction. After more than a month of effort, the more than 40,000 participating laborers have completed over 2.4 million cubic meters of earthwork, accounting for 60 percent of the planned winter project tasks. On the North Fei River construction site, stretching over 400 li, the laborers overcame the difficulties of construction in the severe cold, improved labor organization and operational methods, and generally increased excavation efficiency by 20 percent. Each laborer can excavate up to four cubic meters of earth per day at most, and generally about two cubic meters. The Zhu Huaishun labor team, famous as a model worker in harnessing the Huai River, still improved its work efficiency when encountering hard soil layers during excavation.
    Recently, the laborers and cadres participating in the North Fei River Drainage and Irrigation Project studied the general line of the state during the transition period and further implemented the increase production and practice economy movement. Due to timely improvements in engineering design, tightening of expenditures, and increased work efficiency, it is estimated that the state can save more than 6 billion yuan by the end of the winter project.

    北淝河排涝灌溉工程加紧施工
    安徽省北淝河排涝灌溉工程正在紧张进行冬季施工。参加工程的四万多民工经一个多月的努力，已完成土方二百四十多万公方，占冬季工程计划任务的百分之六十。伸展四百多里的北淝河工地上，民工们克服了严寒气候下施工的困难，改进了劳动组合和操作方法，挖土效率普遍提高了百分之二十。民工每人每天最多能挖土四公方，一般的也能挖土二公方左右。著名的治淮劳动模范祝怀顺民工小队在挖土时遇到坚硬的土层，工作效率仍有提高。
    最近，参加北淝河排涝灌溉工程的民工和干部们学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线，更进一步地贯彻了增产节约运动。由于及时改进了工程设计，紧缩了开支，提高了工作效率，估计到冬季工程结束时可为国家节约六十多亿元。（新华社）
