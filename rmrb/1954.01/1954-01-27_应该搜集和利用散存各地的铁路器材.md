　　Railroad Materials Scattered in Various Places Should Be Collected and Utilized
    Yin Zengguang and Xiao Lian of the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau wrote: In March of last year, workers at the Liujia Maintenance Team of the Nanchang Engineering Section of the Guangzhou Railway Administration heard that a large number of steel rails were piled up on a highway thirty miles from the station. The foreman Chen Chuntao and three others used their weekend holidays to search along the highway and found that many bridges on the highway were paved with steel rails. One bridge alone was paved with one hundred and seventy-three 63-pound steel rails. After returning, they immediately asked the engineering section to report the situation to the Engineering Department of the Guangzhou Railway Administration. The Administration wrote to the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Bureau requesting the return of the railway materials. However, the Highway Bureau replied that they would have to wait until the bridges were overhauled before returning them. Later they said that the funds for the major overhaul were not yet available, so the time for repairing the bridges could not be determined. In this way, after more than eight months of correspondence, the steel rails were still piled up on the highway section. When the river rose last August, many of the steel rails laid on the bridge were washed away by the flood. The quality of these steel rails was very good, and they were about 80% new, each worth more than one million yuan.
    According to our understanding, in various places along the Nanchang-Xunyang, Zhejiang-Jiangxi and other railways within Jiangxi Province (such as De'an, Jinxian, Xingan, Wannian counties, etc.), there are many valuable railway materials scattered, such as steel rails, large and small bridges, iron piers, etc. Ruijin County in Jiangxi Province also has two hundred and four steel rails in storage, of which one hundred and sixty-one are complete, and the rest can be used after a little repair. However, no one is paying attention to these materials. This situation may also exist in other regions.
    It is suggested that the Central Ministry of Railways pay attention to this issue and instruct all railway bureaus to pay attention to collection. The units in various places that have railway materials in storage should also actively assist in this work and take the initiative to return them to the railway department so that these materials can be reasonably utilized.

### 应该搜集和利用散存各地的铁路器材

专栏：读者来信摘要

　　应该搜集和利用散存各地的铁路器材
    南昌铁路分局殷增光、效廉来信：去年三月间，广州铁路管理局南昌工务段刘家养路工区的工人们听说离车站三十里的一条公路上积存有大批钢轨。工长陈春涛等四人即利用星期休假日到公路沿线寻找，结果发现公路上很多桥梁是用钢轨铺成的，有一条桥上就铺有一百七十三根、重六十三磅的钢轨。他们回来后立即请工务段把情况转报广州铁路管理局工务处。管理局向江西省公路局去信要求归还铁路器材。但公路局回信说，必须等桥梁大修时再归还；以后又说：大修费用一时尚无着落，因而修桥时间也无法确定。这样，公文来往八个多月，钢轨还是被积压在公路段上。去年八月间河水上涨时，铺在桥上的钢轨被大水冲掉不少。这些钢轨的质量都很好，而且都有八成新，每根要值一百余万元。
    据我们了解，在江西省境内的南浔、浙赣等铁路沿线各地（如德安、进贤、新淦、万年等县），都散存很多有价值的铁路器材，如钢轨、大小桥梁、铁墩等。江西省瑞金县也积存有二百零四根钢轨，其中有一百六十一根是完整的，其余的稍加整修也都可用。但这些材料都无人过问。这种情况可能其它地区也有。
    建议中央铁道部重视这个问题，指示各路局注意搜集。各地存有铁路器材的单位也应该积极协助这个工作，主动交还铁路部门，使这些器材能够得到合理的利用。
