Party committees and people's governments in various regions conscientiously resolved the issue of enrollment and employment for primary school graduates last year, and have achieved considerable success.

First, various regions made their utmost efforts to find ways to solve the learning problems of primary school graduates. Many places adopted the "two-shift system" and expanded the number of students per class. In addition to the original enrollment plan, a large number of new junior high school freshmen and students in intermediate cultural supplementary schools equivalent to junior high school level were additionally enrolled. According to incomplete statistics from 31 provinces and cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Hebei, Anshan, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Songjiang, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Shanghai, Jinan, Zhejiang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Xi'an, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Chongqing, and Guiyang, 156,595 additional students were enrolled (the national additional enrollment figure is approximately 160,000). In many cities, the enrollment rate of primary school graduates reached about 80 percent. The national average enrollment rate in urban and rural areas reached about 30 percent.

In addition to fully utilizing the potential of existing junior high schools, various regions also opened various forms of tutoring classes, such as tutoring classes attached to middle schools, tutoring classes attached to primary schools, tutoring classes attached to government offices, self-funded tutoring classes, night schools... etc., so that primary school graduates could have the opportunity to study. According to incomplete statistics from ten provinces and cities including Beijing, Hebei, Lüda, Benxi, Songjiang, Wuhan, Hubei, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Xi'an, more than 73,200 primary school graduates were enrolled in the above various forms, accounting for 17.2% of the total number of primary school graduates in the above areas. Some tutoring classes review courses, while others provide job training.

Many industrial and mining enterprises run schools for their employees' children to solve the difficulty of children's enrollment. In Lüda City alone, 3,000 primary school graduates were transferred to study in schools for employees' children. In addition, various regions also made full use of other methods to guide some primary school graduates who did not pass the entrance examination to secondary schools to study on their own. For example, the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station held "Cultural Supplementary Lectures," which were broadcast five times a week. The content included language, arithmetic, geography, history, natural sciences and other courses. The Dalian Children's Culture Center organized many children into slide, reading, art and other groups to enable them to carry out various beneficial activities. Cultural centers in various districts have opened children's reading rooms and added children's books for children to read. Jinan City also stipulated a "Graduate Return Day" system (once or twice a week), where schools are responsible for conducting current affairs and political education, labor education and moral education to them in a planned manner, arranging the content of review homework, answering questions raised by students, and so on.

At the same time, various regions also organized primary school graduates to participate in labor production according to different situations. In rural areas, many primary school students, after participating in agricultural production, became production experts and organizers for promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement and spreading advanced production experience. In Chaoshui Township, Shandong Province, a large number of senior primary school graduates participated in labor, which not only changed their views on labor, but also promoted agricultural production. Parents generally expressed satisfaction. In cities, many older students who did not pass the entrance examination to secondary schools found jobs with the help of the people's government. According to incomplete statistics from Beijing, Lüda, and Songjiang provinces, 11,563 primary school graduates were employed with the help of the government, accounting for 9.5% of the total number of primary school graduates in the above areas (excluding those who found jobs on their own). They served as factory apprentices, trainees in state-owned commercial agencies, streetcar ticket sellers, and assistant auto drivers, etc.

    各地党委和人民政府
    认真解决小学毕业生的升学就业问题
    去年各地党委和人民政府，认真解决小学毕业生的升学和就业问题，已取得相当大的成绩。
    各地首先尽最大的努力，设法解决小学毕业生的学习问题。许多地方都采用了“二部制”，扩大每班的学额等。在原订招生计划之外，增招了大批初中一年级新生和相当于初中程度的中级文化补习学校学生。据北京、天津、山西、河北、鞍山、辽东、辽西、松江、吉林、黑龙江、热河、上海、济南、浙江、武汉、广州、河南、江西、湖北、湖南、广东、广西、西安、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、重庆、贵阳等三十一个省市不完全的统计，增招了十五万六千五百九十五名（全国增招数字，约有十六万人）。许多城市小学毕业生的升学率达到百分之八十左右。全国城乡平均升学率达到百分之三十左右。
    除充分发挥原有初级中学的潜力外，各地还开办了各种形式的补习班，如中学附设补习班、小学附设补习班、机关附设补习班、自费补习班、夜校……等，使小学毕业生得到学习的机会。据北京、河北、旅大、本溪、松江、武汉、湖北、广西、江西、西安等十个省市的不完全统计，用上述各种形式招收了七万三千二百多名小学毕业生，占上述地区小学毕业生总数的百分之十七点二。补习班有的是复习课程，有的是进行就业训练。
    许多工矿企业自办职工子女学校，来解决子女入学困难，仅旅大市转入职工子女学校学习的高小毕业生就有三千人。此外，各地还充分利用其他各种方式来指导部分未考入中等学校的小学毕业生进行自学，如上海市人民广播电台举办了“文化补习讲座”，每星期广播五次，播讲内容有语文、算术、地理、历史、自然等课程；大连市儿童文化馆，把许多儿童组织到幻灯、读书、美术等小组里，使他们进行各种有益的活动；各区文化馆，都开辟了儿童阅览室，增添了儿童图书，供儿童们阅览。济南市还规定了“毕业生返校日”的制度（每星期规定一次或两次），由学校负责有计划地向他们进行时事政治教育、劳动教育及品德教育，布置复习功课的内容，解答学生提出的疑难问题等等。
    同时，各地根据不同的情况还组织小学毕业生参加劳动生产。在农村中，许多小学生参加农业生产后，成为生产的能手，成为推动互助合作运动和传播先进生产经验的组织者。山东省潮水乡大批高小毕业生参加劳动后，不但改变了对劳动的看法，而且推动了农业生产。家长普遍表示满意。在城市中许多没有考入中等学校的年龄较大的学生，在人民政府帮助下，找到了职业。据北京市、旅大、松江省等地区不完全的统计，有一万一千五百六十三名小学毕业生在政府的帮助下，走上工作岗位，占上述地区小学毕业生总数的百分之九点五（自找职业的未计算在内）。他们分别担任了工厂学徒工，国营商业机关的练习生、电车售票员、汽车司机助手等工作。
