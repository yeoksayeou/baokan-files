"Hindsight" Instructions

Reader Wang Kan writes: Silkworm cocoons and fragrant pears are local products of the Korla area in Xinjiang. In April of last year, the Korla Trading Branch Company, based on the demands of the local people, requested approval from the superior company to purchase them vigorously. The Yanqi Trading Branch Company's reply at the time was: "These are not major commodities and will not be handled for the time being."

However, in early September, the Korla Trading Branch Company received an instruction from the Yanqi Trading Branch Company to purchase silkworm cocoons. The instruction stated: "After seeing this document, it is hoped that you will immediately organize forces to purchase vigorously," "Further delays will affect the quality and specifications of the silk." The Korla Trading Branch Company did not know whether to laugh or cry upon seeing the instruction. It turned out that local silkworm cocoons had been on the market in large quantities in May, and the silkworm farmers brought the cocoons to the doorstep of the trading company, but the company did not purchase them. The silkworm farmers had no choice but to endure the pain of lowering prices and letting private merchants buy them.

In mid-October, the Yanqi Trading Branch Company issued another instruction, asking the Korla Trading Branch Company to find out "what the current market price of fragrant pears is and how many can be purchased," and instructed them to "report to the Yanqi Branch Company quickly so that a decision on purchasing can be made." In fact, local fragrant pears generally ripened in early September, and private merchants had already prepared to purchase the pears in July and August. By the time the instruction was issued, fragrant pears had already been concentrated in the hands of private merchants in large quantities. Even if the Yanqi Trading Branch Company decided to purchase, there would only be a few pears left on the market, and the price of pears would also be twice as high as when they were generally on the market.

### “马后炮”的指示

    “马后炮”的指示
    读者王堪来信：蚕茧和香梨都是新疆库尔勒一带的土产品。去年四月间，库尔勒贸易支公司就根据当地群众要求，请示上级公司准予大力收购。焉耆贸易分公司当时给他们的答复是：“这不是主要商品，暂不经营。”
    但是，到九月初，库尔勒贸易支公司却收到焉耆贸易分公司发来的一件收购蚕茧的指示。指示上说：“希见文后，立即组织力量大力收购”，“如再拖延会影响蚕丝的质量和规格”。库尔勒贸易支公司看到指示哭笑不得。原来当地蚕茧在五月里就大量上市了，那时蚕农把蚕茧送到贸易公司的门上，公司都不收购。蚕农无奈只得忍痛压价让私商收去了。
    十月中旬，焉耆贸易分公司又发下一件指示，要库尔勒贸易支公司了解“现市场香梨价格若干，能收购多少”，并要他们“速报焉耆分公司，以便决定收购”。其实当地香梨在九月初就普遍成熟了，私商们在七、八月间就做好了收梨的准备，当指示发到时，香梨早已大批地集中在私商手里了。焉耆贸易分公司即使决定收购，市上只剩下很少一些梨，而梨价也比普遍上市时上涨了两倍。
