Azerbaijan's Largest Hydropower Station
By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He

Good news of construction has come from north-central Azerbaijan: the two turbine generators of the Mingachevir Hydropower Station began generating electricity on January 10th.

The Mingachevir Hydropower Station is the largest hydropower station in the Azerbaijan Republic and one of the large hydropower stations to be completed during the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development. The achievement of this hydropower station construction makes me feel as excited as the Azerbaijanis and the Soviets. The Pozda Valley (in Azerbaijani, "Pozda" means "barren mountain"), surrounded by hills and ridges, the turbulent Kura River, the bustling work of construction workers, mud dredgers, and excavators on the Mingachevir construction site, and the construction workers' residences that resemble towns, all reappear before my eyes. That was the scene when I visited the Azerbaijan Republic with the Chinese Farmers' Delegation in the autumn of 1952. And now, the first phase of this project has been completed, and all six turbine generators will be generating electricity by the end of the year, completing the entire project one year ahead of schedule!

The Azerbaijanis wrote their ideal of building the Mingachevir Hydropower Station into their own dance drama. Now they have realized the centuries-old ideal of controlling and utilizing the often-flooding Kura River in the lower Pozda Valley. This ideal was already drafted before the Patriotic War, but its realization was later interrupted by the war. Peace-loving people immediately started construction after the war. The entire Soviet Union supported this project. This large hydropower station built in Azerbaijan, like the large hydropower stations built in other Soviet republics, is the crystallization of the friendly unity of all Soviet nationalities. Azerbaijanis, Georgians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Tatars, Belarusians, Moldavians, and people of other nationalities are working side by side diligently. More than 300 factories in Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sverdlovsk, Kiev, Minsk, Baku, and all over the country are continuously supplying the Mingachevir construction site with a large number of construction equipment, machines, and materials.

The Mingachevir Hydropower Station is a huge project. Its dam is 1,540 meters long, 500 meters wide, and 87.5 meters high. The dam is now 64 meters high, and 11.5 million cubic meters of mud and sand have been built. There, high dams are being built for the first time in the Soviet Union using alluvial methods without scaffolding. According to the old method of dam construction, more than 20,000 cubic meters of wood, hundreds of carpenters, fitters, welders, and earthworkers were needed. The alluvial method only uses five cranes for unloading and transporting pipes and twelve workers. This shortens the time by more than half a year, saves about 800 workers, and saves several million rubles. The new method washes more than 20,000 cubic meters of mud and sand every day. These mud and sand are sucked from large yards near the construction site by mud dredgers and transported through their conveying pipes. No less than thirty excavators are working to collect sand and mud. The high dam had already blocked the Kura River in 1953, creating a reservoir that can store 16 billion cubic meters of floodwater. Now the water level in the reservoir is 56 meters high, and the reservoir is 65 kilometers long. This year, the length of the reservoir will reach 75 kilometers and the width will reach 25 kilometers. This is the man-made Mingachevir Sea.

The Mingachevir Hydropower Station has opened up broad prospects for the economic development of the Azerbaijan Republic. The 370,000 kilowatts of electricity generated by the six generators of the hydropower station (1.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year) will approximately double the republic's electricity, and will first supply the oil industry in Baku with sufficient and cheap power. Industrial cities such as Kirovabad and Sumgait, hundreds of tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms will all be supplied with electricity. Sufficient electricity will electrify Azerbaijan's agriculture and railway transportation and will further advance the industrial production of towns near Mingachevir. The water of the Mingachevir Sea will pass through crisscrossing irrigation canals to reclaim more than one million hectares of irrigated land in the arid grasslands of the lower reaches of the Kura and Araks rivers, in order to increase the production of large quantities of cotton, melons, fruits, and feed.

The Mingachevir construction workers completed the 1953 plan ahead of schedule and are now striving to complete the entire project ahead of schedule. The achievement of Azerbaijan's largest hydropower station shows that communist construction projects are not only being carried out in Kuibyshev and Stalingrad, but also in many places throughout the Soviet Union.

    阿塞拜疆的最大水电站
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    从阿塞拜疆中北部传出了建设的捷音：明格查乌尔水电站的两座涡轮发电机在一月十日开始发电了。
    明格查乌尔水电站是阿塞拜疆共和国的最大水电站，是苏联发展国民经济第五个五年计划中要完工的大水电站之一。这个水电站建筑的成就，使我感觉到和阿塞拜疆人，和苏联人一样兴奋。那冈峦环抱的波兹达（阿塞拜疆话“波兹达”就是“荒山”）山谷，湍急的库拉河流，明格查乌尔工地上建筑工人、汲泥机、挖土机的沸腾工作，俨然城镇的建筑工人住宅，一幕幕再现在眼前。那是一九五二年秋天随同中国农民代表团参观阿塞拜疆共和国时候的情景。而现在，这个工程已经完成第一批，到年底全部六座涡轮发电机都将发电，全部工程将提前一年完成！
    阿塞拜疆人把建设明格查乌尔水电站的理想写在自己的舞剧中。现在他们实现了在较低的波兹达山谷控制和利用常常泛滥成灾的库拉河的好几世纪来的理想。这个理想在卫国战争前已经拟成方案，它的实现后来被战争阻断了。爱好和平建设的人民在战后立即动工建筑。苏联全国支援这个工程。这个在阿塞拜疆境内建设的大水电站，正如在苏联其他共和国境内建设的大水电站一样，是苏联各民族友好团结的结晶。阿塞拜疆人，格鲁吉亚人、阿尔明尼亚人、乌克兰人、鞑靼人、白俄罗斯人、摩尔达维亚人，以及其他民族的人，并肩地努力地工作着。莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、基辅、明斯克、巴库和全国各地三百多个工厂源源不绝地供给明格查乌尔工地大批建筑设备、机器和材料。
    明格查乌尔水电站的工程是巨大的。它的堤坝长一千五百四十公尺，宽五百公尺，高八十七·五公尺。现在堤坝已有六十四公尺高，已筑一千一百五十万立方公尺泥沙。那里在苏联第一次无需搭架地用冲积方法筑积高大堤坝。本来按照旧法筑堤需要二万立方公尺以上木材，几百个木工，装配工，焊工，土工。而冲积方法只用五台起卸输送管的起重机和十二个工人。这缩短了半年多时间，节省了约八百个工人，节约了几百万卢布。新方法每天冲积二万立方公尺以上泥沙。这些泥沙是在工地附近的大场子上用汲泥机吸取，并经过它的输送管运送的。为了采集沙泥，不下三十台挖土机工作着。高大的堤坝在一九五三年已经挡住库拉河，造成了能蓄洪一百六十亿立方公尺的水库。现在水库内水位有五十六公尺高，水库有六十五公里长。今年内水库的长度将达七十五公里，宽度将达二十五公里。这是人工造成的明格查乌尔海。
    明格查乌尔水电站为阿塞拜疆共和国的经济的发展开辟了广阔的前途。水电站的六部发电机所发的三十七万瓩的电力（每年十五亿瓩时电量），将使共和国的电力增加约一倍，首先将供给巴库的石油业以充足而便宜的动力。基洛夫巴德、苏木盖特等工业城市，几百个拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄，都将得到电力的供应。充足的电力将使阿塞拜疆的农业和铁道运输电气化，将使明格查乌尔附近的城镇的工业生产前进一步。明格查乌尔海的水将经过纵横分布的灌溉渠在库拉河和阿拉克斯河下游干旱的草原增辟一百万公顷以上的灌溉土地，以增产大量的棉花、瓜果和饲料。
    明格查乌尔建筑工人提前完成了一九五三年计划，现在为提前完成全部工程而努力着。阿塞拜疆最大水电站的成就，说明共产主义建筑工程不但在古比雪夫和斯大林格勒，而且在苏联全国许多地方进行着。    一月十四日
