North China:

    Vigorously Supply Handicraft Products Needed by Farmers
    Achievements in Material Supply Work of Cooperatives in Various Parts of North China
    In the fourth quarter of last year, cooperatives in various parts of North China extensively carried out the movement to increase production and practice economy. At the same time, all cadres studied the general line of the state during the transition period, and there were many improvements in business operations and working methods. The material supply work in the fourth quarter achieved significant results. In the production increase and economy practice movement last year, the retail plan of cooperatives in the entire North China region in the fourth quarter expanded by more than 10 percent, an increase of more than 47 percent compared with the same quarter in 1952. According to the inspection in December last year, this plan was completed by approximately 163 percent.

    In the fourth quarter of last year, cooperatives in various parts of North China vigorously implemented the policy of decentralizing business and strengthening the independent management capabilities of county-level and grassroots cooperatives, and improved relations with state-owned commerce. Grassroots cooperatives generally increased the quantity and variety of goods purchased from local state-owned companies. At the same time, cooperatives in various regions paid special attention to organizing local sources of goods. The main method of organizing local sources of goods was to convene internal business organization meetings of cooperatives with the participation of handicraft production cooperatives and handicraftsmen. Such meetings have been held more than fifteen times in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan and other places, with a total transaction value of more than 600 billion yuan. When organizing local sources of goods, cooperatives in various regions focused on operating production materials urgently needed by farmers, such as livestock, carts, plows, plowshares, and iron shovels, and added building materials such as bricks, tiles, and wood, as well as daily-use furniture such as pots, bowls, basins, and spoons. In the past, cooperative cadres often considered these commodities to be bulky and difficult to manage. After the launch of the production increase and economy practice movement, grassroots cooperatives generally added these types of commodities, generally adding about 100 types, and in some cases adding more than 500 or 600 types. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei and Shanxi provinces, more than 14,000 heads of livestock were supplied to the masses in October and November last year, and more than 310,000 pieces of small farm tools have been prepared and sold. The Nan Shimen Grassroots Cooperative in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, once added 7 million yuan worth of porcelain, which was warmly welcomed by the masses, and the entire batch of goods was sold out in two days.

    In the fourth quarter of last year, cooperatives in various parts of North China generally increased the number of retail outlets, developed mobile supply and marketing groups, and extensively organized and participated in small-scale material exchange fairs. By the end of November last year, cooperatives in the Tianjin Special Zone of Hebei Province had added 125 stalls, 61 mobile supply and marketing groups, 7 distribution points, and 5 stores. After Fengrun County Cooperative in Hebei Province increased its organization, there was an average of one supply and marketing point in each township. Cooperatives in Hebei and Shanxi provinces generally organized small-scale material exchange fairs, attracting handicraftsmen, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and member representatives to participate in supply and marketing operations. According to statistics from more than 70 counties in Lucheng, Wuxiang and other places in Shanxi Province, more than 390 small-scale material exchange fairs were held in October and November last year, with the participation of nearly 1,000 grassroots cooperatives; according to statistics from 338 material exchange fairs among them, the total transaction value reached more than 140 billion yuan. All of this has played a significant role in supporting the procurement of grain, cotton, and other items.

    大力供应农民需要的手工业产品
    华北各地合作社物资供应工作有成绩
    华北区各地合作社在去年第四季度广泛开展了增产节约运动，同时全体干部学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，业务经营和工作方法都有不少改进，第四季度的物资供应工作有显著的成绩。去年增产节约运动中，华北全区合作社第四季度的零售计划扩大了百分之十多，比一九五二年同季增大百分之四十七以上，据去年十二月的检查，这一计划约完成百分之一百六十三。
    在去年第四季度，华北各地合作社大力贯彻了业务下放和加强县级与基层合作社独立经营能力的方针，并改进了和国营商业的关系。基层合作社普遍增加了就近向当地国营公司进货的数量和品种。同时，各地合作社特别注意进行了组织地方货源的工作。组织地方货源的主要办法，是召开有手工业生产合作社和手工业者参加的合作社内部的业务组织会议。这种会议，已在北京、天津、石家庄、太原等地召开过十五次以上，成交总额达六千多亿元。各地合作社在组织地方货源时，着重经营了农民迫切需要的牲口、大车、犁、铧、铁锨等生产资料，并增添了砖、瓦、木材等建筑器材和锅、碗、盆、勺等日用家具。这些商品，多是合作社干部过去认为笨重、不易经营的。开展增产节约运动后，各基层合作社普遍增添了这类商品，一般增添一百种左右，多的增添五、六百种以上。据河北、山西两省不完全的统计，去年十、十一两月即供给群众牲畜一万四千多头，已备妥和销出的小农具达三十
  一万余件。河北省邢台县南石门基层合作社一次增添了值七百万元的瓷器，受到群众热烈欢迎，两天内这批货就全部卖光。
    华北各地合作社在去年第四季度普遍增设了零售点，发展了流动供销组，并广泛组织和参加了小型物资交流会。河北省天津专区合作社，到去年十一月底已增设一百二十五个货摊，六十一个流动供销组，七个分销处和五个门市部。河北省丰润县合作社增设机构后，平均每乡都有一个供销点。河北、山西两省的合作社普遍组织了小型物资交流会，吸收手工业者和农业生产合作社、互助组、社员代表等参加，开展供销业务。山西省据潞城、武乡等七十余县的统计，去年十、十一两个月内共举行了三百九十余个小型物资交流会，约有近千个基层合作社参加；据其中三百三十八个物资交流会的统计，成交总额达一千四百余亿元。这都对支援粮、棉等收购工作起了不小作用。
