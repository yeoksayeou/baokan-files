The glorious life of Matvey Fyodorovich Shkiryatov, one of the oldest activists of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a selfless fighter for the great cause of communism, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Chairman of the Party Control Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, passed away on the evening of January 18, 1954, after a long and serious illness.

Matvey Fyodorovich was born in 1883 into a poor peasant family. From a young age, he experienced the harsh tests of life, working as a tailor first in the countryside and later in the city.

M.F. Shkiryatov joined the Communist Party in 1906 and engaged in immense Party work among the workers in sewing factories. The Tsarist police closely monitored this young Bolshevik and arrested him in 1909.

After Comrade Shkiryatov was released, he resumed revolutionary work, doing Party work in the Moscow Bolshevik Party organization.

Comrade M.F. Shkiryatov was arrested by the police once again in 1910 and expelled from Moscow. Comrade Shkiryatov then carried out underground revolutionary work in Rostov-on-Don. Soon after, M.F. Shkiryatov was arrested again and exiled to Vologda province for three years.

In 1914, after returning from exile, M.F. Shkiryatov engaged in secret Party and trade union work in the Moscow Party organization. In 1915, Matvey Fyodorovich was conscripted into the army.

During his military service, Comrade Shkiryatov maintained close contact, first with the underground Party organization in Tula, and later with the underground Party organization in Moscow. During the February Revolution of 1917, Comrade Shkiryatov was elected by the Bolshevik Party organization in the army to participate in the Moscow Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. He also conducted immense organizational and agitational work among the soldiers of the Moscow garrison and in the factories of Moscow. He was a member of the Military Organization Bureau of the Moscow Party Committee.

On the eve of the Great October Socialist Revolution, M.F. Shkiryatov was in Tula, where he was the representative of the Bolshevik Party organization in the Executive Committee of the Tula Soviet of Workers' Deputies. During the October Revolution, he was a member of the Tula Revolutionary Military Committee.

In August 1918, Comrade Shkiryatov was elected Secretary of the Central Committee of the Sewing Workers' Union. He also served as a member of the Moscow City Party Committee. In 1920, he was the Chairman of the Moscow Provincial Branch of the Sewing Workers' Union and a member of the Moscow City Party Committee.

In 1921, M.F. Shkiryatov transferred to work in the Central Committee of the Party. In the Central Committee, he led the Central Commission for Reviewing and Purging Party Members. At the Eleventh Party Congress, Comrade Shkiryatov delivered a summary report on the purge. At this Congress, he was elected a member of the Central Control Commission.

From 1923, M.F. Shkiryatov served as a member of the Presidium of the Central Control Commission. Comrade Shkiryatov was repeatedly elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.

At the Seventeenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, M.F. Shkiryatov was elected as a member of the Party Control Commission of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). At the Eighteenth Party Congress, Comrade Shkiryatov was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Party.

From 1939 to 1952, he was the Deputy Chairman of the Party Control Commission of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).

At the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade Shkiryatov was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and appointed as Chairman of the Party Control Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Comrade Shkiryatov was a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, and a deputy of the Moscow City Soviet. For his outstanding contributions to the motherland, Matvey Fyodorovich Shkiryatov was awarded three Orders of Lenin and many Soviet medals.

The death of Matvey Fyodorovich Shkiryatov has deprived us of a strong and indomitable communist, an outstanding leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union, whose glorious life is an example of selfless service to the Party and the people.

Comrade Shkiryatov had traversed the revolutionary path of fighting for the people's cause for about fifty years, and he was a fearless warrior of the great Soviet Communist Party. He and the Party went through a long and glorious road together, and he dedicated his strength to his people, the great Soviet motherland, and the cause of building communism in our country.

The glorious image of Matvey Fyodorovich Shkiryatov will forever live in the hearts of the Soviet people.
