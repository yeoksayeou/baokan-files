Wearing Clothes, Don't Forget the Weaver
The newly built state-owned Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory in the Northwest region officially started production on December 27th last year. During the construction of this factory, from the beginning of the site survey, the local farmers were concerned about providing various design materials. The construction of the factory required more than 700 mu of land. In addition to occupying some wasteland and open space, most of the cultivated land was given up by the farmers according to the government's purchase price. A middle peasant named Liu Zhenjiang generously gave up more than two mu and seven fen of land. He said, "The land is as dear as a mother after three years of cultivation. How can a farmer not love his own land? But, the state runs factories for our good life!" Before liberation, when Lu Guilan, a farmer from Hou Liu Village in Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, got married, her only "dress" was a homespun and dyed red vest. After the summer harvest last year, she sold some surplus grain and exchanged it for various colors of mercerized cloth. Some time ago, she visited this newly built factory and was very moved. She said, "Wearing clothes, don't forget the weaver. Our farmers must grow good cotton and grain and sell it to the country, so that the workers can weave more and better cloth for us!"

Farmers urgently need workers' help
On December 13th last year, workers from the No. 1 Power Plant of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau visited farmers in Xiaopu Township in the suburbs of Huangshi City. The farmers said to the workers: "Soviet farmers, with the help of their worker brothers, are using tractors and harvesters. Our worker brothers have also manufactured new agricultural tools, but there are still too few." They hoped to supply more water pumps, waterwheels, and fertilizers. Farmer Liang Runchen said: "Growing millet is most afraid of drought, because without water pumping tools, we can only watch the seedlings die. In the past, we relied on the sky for food. In the future, to improve production technology, we must rely on our worker brothers."

The workers, after listening to the farmers' opinions, deeply realized the glory and importance of their responsibilities. Lin Bingchu, a master of the water supply factory, said: "The farmers urgently need our help. If we don't produce well, we will be embarrassed to be their older brother." Young worker Zeng Zhaofang said: "I will definitely produce well and ensure safety, so that steel mills, farm tool factories, and yarn factories can get sufficient electricity to manufacture more new agricultural tools and industrial products, and help farmers gradually embark on the socialist road."

After visiting large factories, settle down to agricultural production
On December 7th last year, sixty-four agricultural labor models from Yongji County, Jilin Province, visited four large factories. After the visit, they were greatly moved. Labor model Zhang Kun said: "Some people in our rural areas don't even dare to boldly accept the new agricultural tools promoted by the government. How can we increase production? We must also learn from the workers, promote advanced experience, and increase grain production!" Li Zhongshu also said, "How good is the labor discipline of the workers, how tense their work is; our farmers are not so good, and the standards are uneven." Many agricultural labor models expressed their determination to support national construction after visiting the factories. Chai Zhendong said: "In the past, I was not settled in production in the countryside. This time, I visited the flax factory and heard industrial labor model Mei Guizhi say, 'The country's industrialization must rely on the support of the farmers.' This sentence moved my heart. I value my work. In the future, I will definitely do a good job in our mutual aid group, and gradually move towards collectivization in the future, which would be even better." Qu Zhanchun said after the visit: "In the past, I didn't care about the country's industrial affairs. I thought the development of industry was only good for the workers; this time I realized that without the support of industry, our agriculture cannot develop!"

Relying on workers' help, winter vegetables are planted
The grass and trees in the fields have long been withered by the constantly attacking cold wind. However, in the dazzling glass greenhouses of the Hou Mucheng Yi Village in Yingchengzi District, Dalian City, leeks, spinach, red carrots... have already grown tender green stems and leaves. The workers of the Dalian Glass Factory prepared a large number of glass for the farmers to use for growing vegetables in greenhouses in order to help the farmers grow winter vegetables. At the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, after the village supply and marketing cooperative brought this batch of glass, the woodworking workers helped the farmers in the village make more than 5,000 glass fans for growing vegetables in greenhouses. In this way, farmers can also grow vegetables in winter. Farmer Yang Shixiang, who was busy repairing the greenhouse in the field, pointed to the more than 30 rows of glass greenhouses in his field and said: "Without the help of the workers, how could we grow vegetables in winter!" He stroked the red-rooted, large-leaved spinach that was four inches high and said excitedly: "Before the Spring Festival, our worker brothers will be eating our fresh vegetables!"

The conversation between Yang Qinglin and his son
Yang Qinglin is a young lathe worker in the Shenyang Farm Tool Factory, and his father is a farmer who farms in the countryside. In December last year, his father came to the factory to see Yang Qinglin. At this time, the workers in the factory were working hard to trial-produce a 24-row seeder pulled by a tractor for the farmers. After this seeder is successfully trial-produced, if the daily working time is calculated as ten hours, it can sow 96 hectares of land, which is more than 19 times that of a horse-drawn ten-row seeder, and more than 100 times that of manual sowing. Yang Qinglin said to his father: "Our family uses a clumsy plow to cultivate the land, and it takes half a month to cultivate more than five hectares of land. In the future, with this machine, our five hectares of land will be completely cultivated in less than half an hour." His father was overjoyed when he heard Yang Qinglin's words and said, "I have lived for more than sixty years, and I have never heard of such a fast machine for cultivating land." He was determined and said: "After I go home, I must join the mutual aid group, and I must use new agricultural tools to cultivate the land, so that I can use larger machines in the future." These words encouraged the workers who participated in the trial production, and they expressed that they would complete the trial production task ahead of schedule.

Yongxing Village Farmers Have Their Own Rice Threshing Machine
This year, the mutual aid group of farmer Ma Tongxiang in Yongxing Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, learned new farming methods and harvested a lot more grain.

During the harvest last year, they responded to the call to increase production and save money, and wanted to quickly bring the crops home. There were many crops, and relying on manual labor, they could not finish threshing the grain in a short time; using other people's rice threshing machines, one machine followed one person, and it would cost 50,000 yuan a day for rent. So the group leader and everyone calculated buying a rice threshing machine. Later, after inquiring, the "Dahua" rice threshing machine manufactured by the Jiaohe Local State-owned Dahua Iron Factory only cost more than 900,000 yuan per unit. If there was no money on hand, they could temporarily buy on credit and pay after threshing the grain.

A few days later, the rice threshing machine was transported in. A group of people gathered around to watch. This rice threshing machine was strong and beautiful, and everyone was happy. In early November last year, the whole group used this rice threshing machine to thresh rice, and in one day they threshed more than ten shi of rice, which was much better than manual threshing.

    工农互相帮助，发展建设事业
    穿衣不忘织布人
    西北区新建的国营西北第二棉纺织厂，已在去年十二月二十七日正式开工生产了。在修建这个工厂的过程中，从厂址勘察开始，当地的农民就关心着供给各种设计资料。建厂需要七百多亩土地，除了占用一部分荒地和空地以外，大部都是农民依照政府征购价格而让出的耕地。一个叫刘振江的中农，慷慨地让出了二亩七分多地，他说：“地耕三年亲似娘，庄户人咋能不心爱自己的土地？可是，国家办工厂，是为了咱们过好光景啊！”陕西省咸阳县后刘村农民鲁桂兰，她在解放前结婚时，唯一的“礼服”只有一件自织自染的红褂衫，而去年夏收以后，她卖了一部分余粮，就换回了各色的丝光布。前些时，她参观了这个新建厂后，很受感动，她说：“穿衣不忘织布人，咱们农民一定要种好棉花和粮食，卖给国家，让工人老大哥织出更多更好的布供给咱们！”
    农民迫切需要工人帮助
    去年十二月十三日，武汉冶电业局第一发电厂的工人到黄石市郊区萧铺乡访问了农民兄弟。农民们对工人说：“苏联农民在工人老大哥的帮助下，都使用拖拉机和收割机了。我们的工人老大哥也制造了新农具，但是还太少了。”希望能供给更多的抽水机、水车和肥田粉。农民梁润臣说：“种谷子就是怕天旱，因为没有抽水的工具，眼巴巴地看着禾苗旱死。过去，我们靠天吃饭，今后改良生产技术，要靠工人老大哥了。”
    工人们听了农民的意见，都深深体会到自己的责任的光荣和重大。给水工厂老师傅林炳初说：“农民迫切需要我们的帮助，我们要是不好好生产，这个老大哥当得也不好意思了。”青工曾照芳说：“我一定好好生产、保证安全，使钢铁厂、农具厂、纱厂得到充足电力，制造出更多的新农具和工业品，帮助农民逐步走上社会主义的道路。”
    参观大工厂后，安心农业生产
    去年十二月七日，吉林省永吉县有六十四名农业劳动模范，到四个大工厂去参观。参观之后，都受到了很大的感动。劳动模范张崑说：“咱们农村有些人连政府推广新农具都不敢大胆接受，那怎能提高产量呢？咱们也要学习工人，推广先进经验，增产粮食呢！”李钟述也说：“工人的劳动纪律有多好，干活多紧张；咱们农民就不行了，文齐武不齐的。”很多农业劳动模范在参观工厂以后，都表示了自己支援国家建设的决心。柴振东说：“过去我在农村不安心生产，这回到亚麻厂参观，听工业劳动模范梅桂芝说‘国家工业化，必须靠农民的支援’，这句话打动了我的心，我看重了我的工作，今后我一定把我们的互助组搞好，将来还要逐步走上集体化，那就更好了。”曲占春参观后说：“过去我不关心国家工业的事，我想工业发展光对工人有好处；这回我才知道，没有工业的支援，咱们农业就不能发展啊！”
    依靠工人帮助，冬季种上鲜菜
    田野里的草木，早被不断袭来的寒风吹枯了。但是，旅大市郊营城子区后牧城驿村那耀眼的玻璃烤窖里，韭菜、菠菜、红丁……却已长出嫩绿的茎叶。大连玻璃工厂的工人为了帮助农民种冬菜，老早就准备好了大批玻璃给农民作烤菜用。去年第四季度初，村供销合作社办来了这批玻璃后，木工工人又帮助村里农民做了五千多扇烤菜用的玻璃扇子。这样，农民在冬季里也能种菜了。正在地里忙着修烤窖的农民杨士祥，指着他地里三十多排玻璃烤窖说：“没有工人的帮助，冬季咱哪能种菜呢！”他抚摸着长有四寸高的红根大叶菠菜兴奋地说：“春节前，工人老大哥就要吃上咱的鲜菜啦！”
    杨清林父子俩的谈话
    杨清林是沈阳农具厂的青年车工，他的父亲是个农民，在乡下种田。去年十二月里，他父亲来厂看望杨清林，这时厂里的工人们正为农民紧张地试制拖拉机牵引的二十四行播种机。这种播种机试制成功以后，如果每日作业时间按十小时算，可播种土地九十六垧，超过马拉十行播种机十九倍，比人工播种提高一百多倍。杨清林对他父亲说：“咱家用的笨犁杖种地，五垧多地种了半个月，将来用这种机器种地，咱的五垧地不到半个钟头就全部种完了。”他父亲听了杨清林的话，心里乐得像开了花，说：“我活了六十多岁，从来没听说过有这样快的种地机器。”并下决心说：“我回家后一定要参加互助组，一定要使用新式农具种地，将来好使用更大的机器。”这些话鼓舞了参加试制的职工，表示要提前完成试制任务。
    永兴村农民有了自己的打稻机
        吉林蛟河县永兴村农民马桐祥参加的互助组，今年学习新耕作法，多打了好多粮食。
    去年收割时，他们响应增产节约号召，要赶紧把庄稼拉到家里。庄稼多，靠人工，一时打不完场；用别人的打稻机，一台机器跟着一个人，一天得花五万元租钱。于是组长就和大家划算买打稻机。后来一问，蛟河地方国营大华铁工厂工人制造的“大华号”打稻机，只要九十多万元一台，手头里没钱还可以暂时赊，等打完粮再交款。
    过了几天，打稻机运来了。一伙人围上去看，这打稻机又结实又漂亮，大家全都高兴。去年十一月初，全组用这台打稻机打稻子，一天的工夫就打十来石稻子，比起人工打稻子要强得多。
