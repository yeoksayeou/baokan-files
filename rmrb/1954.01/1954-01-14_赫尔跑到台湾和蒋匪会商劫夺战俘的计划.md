Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th - Our correspondent reports: Far East US military commander Hull flew to Taiwan on the 11th to confer with Chiang Kai-shek's bandits on the issue of transporting Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who have been forcibly detained to Taiwan. Hull's personal dispatch to collude with the Kuomintang bandit gang on the "final plan" to seize prisoners of war proves that the US military authorities have abandoned all pretense and unreservedly show that they are the out-and-out instigator of all the crimes of directing Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents to slaughter and persecute Volunteer Army prisoners of war and forcibly detain them.

According to a report by the Associated Press, Hull made a statement to reporters after arriving in Taipei, explaining that the purpose of his trip was to "finalize" the "plan" to transfer 14,000 Chinese prisoners of war to the Kuomintang bandit gang. Hull indicated that the Chinese prisoners of war seized by the US on January 23 "will be transported to Taiwan by transport ships already waiting in Incheon Port, Korea." Hull told the personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek secret service organization in charge of directing the Kuomintang secret service activities in Dongchang-ri that as long as the "specified time" arrives, the United States will transport the prisoners of war to Taiwan, and "we are fully prepared for this." He emphasized that what is needed now is "execution."

Before Hull went to Taiwan, US Eighth Army Commander Taylor had already announced the US plan to seize prisoners of war and discussed it with Wang Fei Dongyuan, the so-called "ambassador" of Chiang Kai-shek stationed in South Korea, who directly commands secret agent activities in prisoner-of-war camps. Wang Fei stated that the Kuomintang bandit gang "fully supports" this plan. According to this plan, the Kuomintang bandit gang will send one hundred special agents from Taiwan to Korea to "receive" the seized Chinese prisoners of war. According to the Associated Press, these prisoners of war will be "transferred to representatives of the Chinese Kuomintang on Incheon Beach" and then escorted to Taiwan by US landing craft.

An Agence France-Presse Taipei dispatch on the 11th indicated that the Kuomintang bandit gang, which is preparing to force these prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder, will, once these prisoners of war fall into their clutches, use the excuse of "Communist elements" to carry out cruel persecution against any prisoners of war who resist in the slightest. After the prisoners of war are escorted to Taiwan, the Kuomintang bandit gang will conduct "special security checks" on them and force them to accept fascist ideological training.

All these facts further expose the ugly face of the US side colluding with the Kuomintang bandit gang under the banner of so-called "voluntary repatriation" to forcibly detain prisoners of war and use them as cannon fodder. According to an Associated Press Taipei dispatch on the 12th, Hull openly stated that "there is absolutely no room for further negotiations on the issue of releasing prisoners." Hull's impatient and barbaric attitude shows that the US side is trying desperately to complete its sinful activities in one fell swoop.

    赫尔跑到台湾和蒋匪会商劫夺战俘的计划
   【新华社开城十二日电】本社特派记者报道：远东美军总司令赫尔十一日飞往台湾和蒋匪会商把强迫扣留下来的中国人民志愿军战俘运往台湾的问题。赫尔亲自出马和国民党匪帮合谋劫夺战俘的“最后计划”，证明美国军事当局已经抛开一切伪装，毫不掩饰它是指使蒋匪特务屠杀迫害志愿军战俘并加以强迫扣留的全部罪行的不折不扣的主使者。
    据合众社报道，赫尔在到达台北以后向记者发表谈话，说明他此行的目的就是要“确定一下”把一万四千名中国战俘移交给国民党匪帮的“计划”。赫尔表明在一月二十三日由美方劫夺下来的中国战俘“将由已在朝鲜仁川港待命的运输船只运往台湾”。赫尔告诉专责指挥东场里国民党特务活动的蒋匪特务组织人员说，只要“规定的时间”一到，美国就要把战俘运往台湾，“我们对此已有充分准备”。他强调说现在需要的只是“执行”。
    在赫尔前往台湾之前，美国第八军军长泰勒已经宣布美方劫夺战俘的计划，并和直接指挥战俘营中特务活动的蒋匪驻南朝鲜所谓“大使”王匪东原进行了讨论，王匪已表示国民党匪帮“完全支持”这一计划。按照这个计划，国民党匪帮将从台湾派选一百名特务头目前往朝鲜去“接收”被劫夺下来的中国战俘，据美联社消息说，这些战俘将“在仁川海滩上被移交给中国国民党代表”，然后由美国登陆艇押送到台湾。
    法新社台北十一日消息表明，准备强迫这些战俘充当炮灰的国民党匪帮，在一旦这些战俘落入他们的魔爪之后将借口“共产党分子”对任何稍有反抗的战俘进行残酷的迫害。国民党匪帮将在战俘押送到台湾以后，对他们施行“特别的治安检查”并强迫他们接受法西斯的思想训练。
    所有这些事实进一步暴露了美方在所谓“自愿遣返”招牌下勾结国民党匪帮强迫扣留战俘充当炮灰的丑恶嘴脸。据合众社台北十二日电，赫尔公然表示“关于释放俘虏问题，绝对没有再进行谈判的余地”。赫尔这种急不可耐的横蛮态度，说明了美方正不顾一切地企图一举而完成其罪恶的勾当。
