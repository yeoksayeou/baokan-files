Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 4th: The Northeast region will build larger-scale modern factories and mines this year according to national plans. Currently, various basic construction units are accelerating preparations for these key projects.

The 1954 national plan has initially determined 103 key construction projects in the Northeast, including projects that are about to begin construction, such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's rebuilt No. 2 steelmaking plant and two blast furnaces, the Harbin Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory, and the Fuxin Xinqiu Coal Mine shaft. Some are projects that are continuing construction, such as the First Automobile Factory and the No. 2 Petroleum Factory. These key projects are a fundamental part of the entire basic construction plan for the region. These projects not only account for more than 70 percent of the total industrial construction investment in the Northeast, but more importantly, the completion of these projects will have a significant effect on the realization of the nation's socialist industrialization. Ensuring the completion of the construction plan for key projects is a very difficult and complex task. The amount of engineering with high technical requirements has greatly increased. For example, metal structure engineering has more than doubled compared to 1953, and giant installation engineering has increased by more than 40 percent. At the same time, for key projects that are about to begin construction, all complex work must be planned carefully. In continuing construction projects, some have entered the construction phase of important parts, and some are nearing completion; therefore, the technical requirements during construction are even higher.

In order to ensure the smooth construction of these key projects, many basic construction departments in the Northeast region began preparations in August last year. All units first concentrated their main efforts on preparing organizational structures, construction forces, drawings and designs, equipment, and materials. Several hundred CCP prefectural committee-level cadres and thousands of county committee-level cadres dispatched by the Organization Department of the CCP Central Committee from all over the country will be successively sent to these key project units to participate in leadership work. The Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau will undertake more than 30 larger projects in 1954, including nearly ten giant factory buildings with metal structures ranging from 10,000 to tens of thousands of square meters in construction area. In order to adapt to the needs of this arduous task, the bureau has established five industrial construction engineering companies, a metal structure engineering company, a comprehensive design institute, and a special agency for soil analysis, testing, and surveying. In order to undertake the task of building, rebuilding, and continuing construction of dozens of large-scale projects in 1954, the Northeast Coal Mine System is preparing to organize two mechanical installation engineering teams, transferring some workers, technicians, and cadres from less important projects to support the key projects. In these projects, five pairs of shafts and nine inclined shafts will be transferred to production successively in 1954.

The design units of various basic construction departments in the Northeast began to concentrate their main efforts in August 1953 to collect factory construction data and carry out design work for key projects. The technical design of a blast furnace project independently designed by Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been completed under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, and construction drawings are currently being compiled. For some key projects aided by the Soviet Union in our country's construction, relevant units have begun to organize translators to translate preliminary designs, technical designs, and construction drawings. Many drawings for the state-owned Harbin Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory and some projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, which will begin construction in 1954, have been translated. Many units have also begun to formulate construction organization designs based on the drawings and the actual conditions of construction.

Equipment and building materials ordered domestically and internationally for many key projects have begun to arrive at the site continuously. Generator components and main building materials for several new and continued construction of modern large-scale power plants, giant ore crushing machinery for metal mines, various machine tools for expanding the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and the Shenyang Wire Factory, building materials needed for five pairs of coal mine shafts, and other complete sets of equipment have begun to be shipped from the Soviet Union one after another. Several key project departments that will begin construction in the first quarter of 1954 have prepared various building materials supplied domestically. Steel rails, various steel products, cement, cable wires, and timber required for construction in the Northeast Coal Mine System have been largely prepared and the organization of a huge transportation force has begun. Other equipment and materials required have been started to be processed and rushed by relevant factories in Anshan, Shenyang, Chongqing, Shanghai, Dalian, and Jiamusi.

### 按照国家计划建设更大规模的现代化厂矿  东北加速进行重点工程准备工作

    按照国家计划建设更大规模的现代化厂矿
    东北加速进行重点工程准备工作
    【新华社沈阳四日电】东北区今年将按照国家计划建设更大规模的现代化工厂和矿山。现在，各个基本建设单位正加速进行这些重点工程的各项准备工作。
    一九五四年国家计划在东北建设的重点工程，初步确定的共有一百零三项，其中有的是将要开始建设的工程，如鞍山钢铁公司改建的第二炼钢厂和两个炼铁炉、哈尔滨电表仪器厂、阜新新邱煤矿竖井等；有的是继续进行建设的工程，如第一汽车厂、石油二厂等。这些重点工程，是全区整个基本建设计划中的根本部分。这些工程不仅投资占东北区全部工业建设投资额百分之七十以上，更重要的是这些工程建设完成以后，对实现国家的社会主义工业化有着巨大的作用。保证完成重点工程的施工计划，是一个非常艰巨而复杂的任务。技术要求高的工程量大大增加了，例如金属结构工程比一九五三年增加了两倍多；巨型安装工程增加了百分之四十以上。同时，将要开始建设的重点工程，一切复杂的工作都要加紧筹划；继续建设的工程中，有的已进入到重要部分的施工阶段，有的已接近于竣工，因此，建设中的技术要求更加高了。
    为了保证这些重点工程的顺利施工，东北区许多基本建设部门从去年八月起就开始了准备工作。各单位首先集中主要力量从组织机构、施工力量、图纸设计到设备和材料等方面，进行准备工作。中共中央组织部从全国各地抽调的数百名中共地委级干部和数千名县委级以上的干部，将陆续派往这些重点工程单位参加领导工作。东北建筑工程局一九五四年承建的较大的工程共三十多个，其中建筑面积一万平方公尺到数万平方公尺金属结构的巨型厂房就有近十个。该局为了适应这个繁重的任务的需要，成立了五个工业建筑工程公司，一个金属结构工程公司，一所综合性设计院和一处土壤分析、化验、测量的专门机构。东北煤矿系统为担负起一九五四年新建、改建和续建数十处规模浩大的工程任务，正在筹组两个机械安装工程队，从比较次要的工程中抽调一部分工人、技术人员和干部，支援各重点工程。在这些工程中，一九五四年将先后有五对竖井和九处斜井要移交生产。
    东北各基本建设部门的设计单位，在一九五三年八月间便开始集中了主要力量着手为重点工程搜集建厂资料和进行设计工作。鞍山钢铁公司自行设计的一座炼铁炉工程的技术设计，在苏联专家具体指导下已经设计好了，目前正编制施工图。苏联帮助我国建设的一部分重点工程，有关单位已开始组织翻译人员进行翻译初步设计、技术设计和施工图等图纸。一九五四年将要开始新建的国营哈尔滨电表仪器厂和鞍山钢铁公司部分工程的图纸，已有许多翻译完了。许多单位并根据图纸与施工的实际条件，开始制订施工组织设计。
    许多重点工程向国内和国外订购的设备和建筑材料，已开始源源运抵现场。若干个新建和续建的现代化大型发电厂的发电机部件和主要建筑材料，金属矿山用的巨型碎矿机械，扩建沈阳第一机床厂和沈阳电线厂用的各种机床，五对煤矿竖井所需要的建筑材料，以及其他的成套的设备等，都开始从苏联陆续运来。一九五四年第一季度开始施工的若干重点工程部门，已把由国内供应的各种建筑材料准备就绪。东北煤矿系统建设中需要的钢轨、各种钢材、水泥、电缆线和木材等，都已大体准备完毕，开始进行庞大运输力量的组织工作；所需要的其他设备和材料，已由鞍山、沈阳、重庆、上海、大连、佳木斯等地的有关工厂开始加工和赶制。
