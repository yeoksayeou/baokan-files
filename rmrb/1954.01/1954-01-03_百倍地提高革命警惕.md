Increase Revolutionary Vigilance a Hundredfold

    The case recently cracked in Tianjin of American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents plotting sabotage and assassination activities, like many major counter-revolutionary sabotage cases cracked across the country in recent years, were carried out under the direct command of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism not only wanted these special agents to sabotage our important industrial construction and warehouses and docks, but also wanted them to carry out bombings and arson in bustling public places to disrupt social order and massacre ordinary people. Before the criminals Qu Fan Hongqi and others sneaked into the Tianjin and Tanggu areas, the U.S. intelligence agencies had made thorough preparations for this conspiracy of sabotage. U.S. special agents stationed in Taiwan and Hong Kong had repeatedly talked to the criminals Qu Fan Hongqi and others, tested their knowledge of explosives, checked their action plans, issued them various U.S.-made explosive materials, and stipulated contact methods. However, under the close surveillance of our people's public security organs, the enemy's evil plot was not successful and we caught them all in one fell swoop. Counter-revolutionary special agents who willingly acted as lackeys were also severely suppressed. This fact once again demonstrates that the Chinese people, who have stood up, have the ability to smash all the enemy's conspiracies and tricks. But at the same time, it also clearly tells us that U.S. imperialism, which has been driven out by the Chinese people, will never be reconciled even though every conspiracy and sabotage activity against our people has suffered a shameful defeat. It will inevitably intensify its use of the Kuomintang bandits entrenched in Taiwan, do its best to collect all the social dregs spurned by our people, and continue to harass and sabotage our people. We must have sufficient understanding of this kind of invisible and hidden sabotage activity by the enemy, and we must increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold.
    Since the founding of our country, we have achieved great victories in political, economic, and cultural construction, basically completed various social reform movements, and realized the restoration of the national economy, thus rapidly entering a new period of socialist economic construction. However, some of our state functionaries have been overwhelmed by these victories, and have developed thoughts of arrogance, complacency, and underestimation of the enemy. They mistakenly believe that since we have gone through a large-scale campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, it seems that we can sit back and relax and not worry about any more counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. More commonly, some people think that the greater the victories we have achieved in construction, the more docile the class enemies will become, and they will not dare to harass and sabotage us anymore. It should be emphasized that this kind of thought of underestimation of the enemy and complacency is extremely harmful and dangerous. It relaxes our revolutionary vigilance, obscures our eyes, and if it is not overcome in a timely and effective manner, it will inevitably give counter-revolutionaries the opportunity to take advantage of the situation to sabotage, causing us to suffer many unnecessary losses on the road forward. In the past year or so, because revolutionary workers in some places have suffered from this political paralysis, some counter-revolutionary elements have successively carried out sabotage incidents such as poisoning, arson, and assassination. In the recent state grain purchase and storage work, some counter-revolutionary elements have also carried out rumors and sabotage, attempting to take the opportunity to create chaos. Although these sabotage activities by counter-revolutionary elements have only occurred in a few places, and have been promptly extinguished by the people's public security organs, they deserve our high attention.
    Therefore, our party and government organs at all levels, people's organizations, and especially the people's public security organs, should regard the education of revolutionary vigilance for their staff and the people as a regular and important task in the future, and effectively strengthen various anti-espionage and confidentiality work. We must make every worker and the masses of the people understand that under the conditions that imperialism still exists today, the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary sabotage activities is a long-term and arduous task, which cannot be completed by a single campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries; nor is it as some people say, that the greater our victories in construction, the more docile the enemy will become. On the contrary, the more and greater the failures the enemy suffers, the closer they are to death, the more they will hate us, and the more they will sabotage us. Comrade Stalin pointed out in the summary at the end of the First Five-Year Plan: "The last remnants of the dying classes, precisely because they are dying and are dying, will inevitably adopt increasingly drastic means of resistance, instigating and mobilizing the backward strata of the population to oppose the Soviet regime." We should always remember this instruction of Comrade Stalin, maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance at all times and in all places, oppose all arrogance, complacency, and underestimation of the enemy, strictly prevent the enemy's sabotage activities, so as to ensure the safety of the state and the people, and ensure the smooth progress of the state's economic construction.

    百倍地提高革命警惕
    最近天津市破获的美蒋特务阴谋进行破坏和暗害活动的案件，和几年来全国许多地方破获的重要反革命破坏案件一样，都是在美帝国主义的直接指挥之下进行的。美帝国主义不但要这批特务破坏我国重要的工业建设和仓库码头，而且要他们在繁华的公共场所实行爆破和纵火，扰乱社会秩序，屠杀普通人民。在屈犯鸿祺等潜来天津和塘沽地区之前，美国情报机关曾为这一阴谋破坏活动作了周密的准备工作。驻在台湾和香港的美国特务人员，曾经三番五次地找屈犯鸿祺等谈话，测验了他们的爆破知识，检查了他们的行动计划，发给他们各种美制爆破器材，规定了联系办法。但是，在我人民公安机关的严密监视之下，敌人的这一罪恶阴谋并未得逞，就被我们一网打尽了。甘心充当走狗的反革命特务分子也受到了严厉的镇压。这一事实再次说明：已经站立起来的中国人民，有能力粉碎敌人的一切阴谋诡计。但同时也再次明白地告诉我们：已经被中国人民赶了出去的美帝国主义，虽然每一次对我国人民的阴谋破坏活动都遭到了可耻的失败，但它是决不会甘心的。它必然要加紧利用盘据台湾的国民党匪徒，尽力搜罗一切被我国人民所唾弃了的社会渣滓，继续对我国人民进行捣乱和破坏。对敌人的这种无形的隐蔽的破坏活动，我们必须有足够的认识，必须百倍地提高自己的革命警惕性。
    我们的国家自从成立以来，不论在政治、经济和文化建设上都获得了伟大的胜利，基本上完成了各种社会改革运动，实现了国民经济的恢复工作，因而迅速地进入了社会主义经济建设的新时期。但是在我们的国家工作人员中，却有一些人被这些胜利冲昏了头脑，滋长了骄傲、自满和轻敌麻痹的思想。他们错误地认为，既然已经经过了大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，似乎我们就可以高枕而卧，不必耽心再有反革命的破坏活动了。更为普遍的是有些人以为：我们在建设上所获得的胜利愈大，似乎阶级敌人就会愈益驯服起来，不敢再对我们进行捣乱和破坏了。应该着重指出，这种轻敌麻痹思想是极其有害的和危险的，它松弛了我们的革命警惕性，模糊了我们的眼睛，如不及时地有效地加以克服，必然给反革命分子以乘机破坏的机会，使我们在前进的道路上遭受许多不应有的损失。最近一年多来，由于有些地方的革命工作人员患了这种政治上的麻痹症，曾经相继发生了一些反革命分子放毒、纵火和暗杀等破坏事件。在最近国家的粮食收购和保管工作中，也有一些反革命分子进行造谣破坏，企图乘机制造纷乱。这些反革命分子的破坏活动，虽然只是在少数地方发生，而且都被人民公安机关及时地扑灭了；但这是值得引起我们高度注意的。
    因此，我们的各级党政机关、人民团体，特别是人民公安机关，今后应把对所属工作人员和人民群众进行革命警惕性的教育当作一项经常的重要工作，并切实加强各种反奸保密的工作。要使每一个工作人员和人民群众都懂得，在今天帝国主义还存在的情况下，肃清反革命破坏活动的斗争是一项长期的艰苦的工作，决不是一次镇压反革命运动就能完成的；同时也决不是像有些人所说的，我们在建设上的胜利愈大，敌人就愈加驯服。相反的，敌人遭受的失败愈多愈大，愈加临近死亡，他们就会愈加仇恨我们，愈要对我们进行破坏活动。斯大林同志在第一个五年计划底总结中曾经指出：“垂死阶级底最后余孽正因为他们已在死亡，奄奄待毙，所以必将采用愈趋剧烈的反抗手段，嗾使和发动居民中落后阶层来反对苏维埃政权。”我们应该经常记住斯大林同志的这一指示，随时随地保持高度的革命警惕，反对一切傲慢自大和轻敌麻痹的思想，严密防范敌人的破坏活动，以保障国家和人民的安全，保障国家经济建设事业顺利进行。
