    Wheat Ears
    – People Building the Mountains, Part Three
    Qin Zhaoyang
    Wang Huainan and District Chief Wang led the visitors to the edge of the field. The people stood in a line around the edge, all staring with widened eyes and stretched faces. For a long time, no one spoke; everyone was stunned by the wheat field.
    This wheat was extraordinarily good: bending down to look, the stalks were thick and short, so dense there were no gaps; the ears were large and long, all uniformly sized, the golden light of the awns dazzlingly bright, truly like a large golden woolen blanket. Standing upright, one could only see dense wheat ears, not the stalks, let alone the soil, as if the ears had all been plucked and laid out to dry on a threshing floor.
    “This isn’t wheat that was planted, it’s a wheat granary that was planted!”
    Someone said this to themselves, immediately causing a burst of exclamations:
    “This isn’t a wheat granary that was planted, it’s gold that was planted!”
    “How much do you think these three mu can yield?”
    “At least six hundred jin per mu, three sixes are eighteen hundred...”
    “Six hundred? I wouldn’t let you have it for seven hundred jin!”
    “Director Wang, what do you estimate the yield will be?”
    Wang Huainan, stroking his stubbly beard, smiled, suppressing his inner excitement, and deliberately said in a low and slow voice:
    “Hehe, our original plan was eight hundred jin per mu, but because the cooperative members initially lacked confidence and weren’t willing to put in the effort, they skipped one plowing, and later it suffered a hailstorm, so we estimate it can only reach seven hundred and fifty...”
    “Good heavens!” Someone clicked their tongue and exclaimed softly.
    Most people were silent, all squinting at the wheat field, perhaps indicating tacit agreement with Wang Huainan's words, or perhaps still somewhat disbelieving. Some, because they were facing the sun, found the awns too dazzling, and moved to the other side to stand. One researcher—a mutual aid team leader from a neighboring village—left the crowd silently and walked to the other end of the field. He bent over the wheat field again and again, finally even crawling on the ground. Only after a long time did he get up, slowly walked back, and nodded continuously, as if he had understood the secret.
    Someone asked him, "What 'method' have you figured out?"
    "Humph," he said, "The old folks always said crops need ventilation. Look at this wheat, it's so dense it's sweating..."
    "I think it's your brain that needs ventilation!" someone interrupted him sarcastically.
    He ignored the sarcasm and bent down again, using his hand to measure the distance between the wheat rows.
    At this time, the people weeding in the surrounding fields also put down their work and came over with their hoes, crowding the open space by the river at the edge of the field. They were all from the same village, and didn't know how many times they had come to look at this field. Today, seeing so many cadres from the whole district coming to visit, and hearing that Wang Huainan's cooperative would begin harvesting this wheat tomorrow, they were still willing to come and "indulge" one last time.
    With more people, the clamor became even livelier.
    From the road over there, an old man carrying a manure basket came, walking so fast as if he had urgent business. When he reached the edge of the field, he threw the manure basket and dung fork on the ground, pushed through the crowd, grabbed Wang Huainan's arm, and said loudly:
    “Director, I have something!...”
    "What is it?" Wang Huainan was taken aback.
    The old man said, "Although this is my land, since it's entered the cooperative, and it's the cooperative's wheat, I have to ask you: will you let me pluck a few wheat ears?"
    The old man's surname was Li. When the cooperative first started trial-planting dense-planted improved wheat varieties on his land, his son agreed, but he didn't, and the father and son almost quarreled over it. Later, when the wheat seedlings came out, and he saw that they were growing slower than those in other fields, he often said to people, "Yield eight hundred jin? Even adding sand won't make it eight thousand jin!" He carried his manure basket to this field twice a day, always worried. After the spring, the seedlings gradually grew vigorously, but he still said: "Planted so densely, it'll rot for sure, just wait to eat wheat straw!" Later, when the wheat began to head, the cooperative opportunely top-dressed it with rice bran, and it immediately showed its superiority over other wheat. Old Man Li never spoke again, but often stood alone by the field, staring at the wheat, lost in thought for half a day. People often said, "Look, the old man is like a scarecrow scaring birds in the field, not moving at all." What exactly he was thinking there, no one knew.
    At this time, everyone's attention was drawn to his expression, and all eyes were focused on him and Wang Huainan.
    Wang Huainan asked him, "Uncle, what do you want a few ears for?"
    "What for?" the old man said, glancing at the people around him, as if questioning them. "I decided this long ago: I want to pluck a few wheat ears from this field and keep them carefully. When I die one day, I want my son to press them against my heart and put them in the coffin with me."
    "Uncle, you've confused me!" Wang Huainan said, looking at the people around him and laughing.
    "Don't you understand?" the old man shouted angrily. "Do you know how I've lived my whole life? My family of five has just this one piece of land. In the past, each mu yielded only four or five dou of wheat per year. What is 'poverty'? This is 'poverty'! So poor, so poor that I didn't believe the land had this much power, could grow so much! During the War of Resistance," he turned to everyone and looked at District Chief Wang, and simply began to speak as if giving a speech, "the government advocated organizing to increase production, but I didn't quite believe it. Later, after we organized, my land yielded more every year, so much that each mu yielded one dan of wheat, and after liberation, one and a half dan. I thought: our mountain land is not as good as the plains, this must be the limit, there's no more 'increasing' to be done!... But look, is this wheat? This isn't a granary, it's a grain mine, it's gold! I've been wanting to escape poverty for decades, and today I've finally seen the end! I want to press the wheat ears against my chest. When I lie in the coffin, my ghost, when it wakes up and touches them, I'll be relieved, I'll be happy. I've finally seen gold in my life, my future generations will finally not be poor!"
    He finished speaking, wiping the tears from his overflowing eyes with the back of his trembling hand.
    People looked at him. Older people were moved to tears by his tears, while younger people were smiling.
    "Hey, Uncle!" Wang Huainan took a step back, shaking his big hands as if to shake off something dirty. "You should put your mind at ease while you're still alive. You haven't lived enough yet, and you're already thinking about death. If my auntie knew, she'd nag you again, you really are!..."
    Wang Huainan was a man accustomed to looking ahead. No matter what the matter, he always stiffened his neck and said: "We have a way!" When the wheat production increase campaign was launched last year, people said: "All you talk about is increasing production, it's been increasing from the War of Resistance until now, still increasing? How can it be increased!" He said again: "We have a way!" But he couldn't come up with a real method, which made him so anxious that he couldn't sleep day and night. Just then, District Chief Wang came to this village. It turned out that in order to answer the masses' question of "how to increase production," District Chief Wang had been even more anxious than him for some time and had recently specially requested to receive agricultural technical training at the commissioner's office. So, they announced to everyone in the village and cooperative: production can be increased, and poverty can be overcome. They mobilized the whole village and cooperative to increase production by an average of one hundred jin per mu, and set a high-yield plan for three mu in the cooperative. ...
    The high-yield plan was set, and the wheat was also planted, but did Wang Huainan himself have one hundred percent confidence? He believed in the higher authorities, believed that the future would be better than the present, and hoped that this high-yield plan could be realized, but in his heart of hearts, he was always very worried about these three mu of wheat. Especially when he kept hearing discouraging words from people like Old Man Li, he became even more uneasy. No one knew that he had come to this field several times in the middle of the night with a ruler to measure the wheat stalks. On the night more than a month ago when it rained heavily and hailed, he came to the field three times. The third time he came, it was already dawn, and he ran into District Chief Wang coming from the road over there. District Chief Wang had come twenty li in the dark in the rain. They walked together to the edge of the field and were moved by the wheat's ability to resist natural disasters. No one knew how happy they were at that time.
    Now, Lao Wang very much wanted to take the opportunity to vent his victorious mood and joy to Old Man Li, and give him a long speech.
    "Uncle, your brain should also be opened up!" – Before he could finish saying this, he was interrupted by District Chief Wang.
    District Chief Wang walked two steps to the old man and asked him:
    "Old Elder, how old are you this year?"
    "Sixty-two." The old man held up his hand to make a gesture.
    "It wouldn't be too much for you to live another ten years, right? Just wait and see the good times!" District Chief Wang said with a smile, grabbing the old man's hand and shaking it vigorously. He sympathized with the old man and was also moved by his own optimistic mood.
    "Haha!" Wang Huainan laughed loudly, and found another opportunity to vent. "In another ten years, it would be strange if our cooperative couldn't achieve an average of more than a thousand jin per mu!"
    "More than a thousand per mu? Did you say that?" The old man quickly shook off the district chief's hand, jumped in front of Wang Huainan, and stared at his face.
    "I said it!" Wang Huainan threw his body back and patted his chest, indicating his wish and also indicating his determination.
    "Haha!" The old man suddenly also shook his hands vigorously, "Then you have to surround the edges of every piece of land with granaries, otherwise the grain will spill! Heavens, hehehehe..." He squinted at the sky, laughing from the bottom of his heart. "Oh, oh, I only hope I can live to that time!"
    "Uncle, don't laugh," Wang Huainan said, deliberately stiffening his face again. "Tell me, can our village's and cooperative's plan to increase production by one hundred jin per mu this year be realized?"
    The old man glanced at the surrounding fields and stopped smiling:
    "Judging from the current situation of the wheat, it's about right."
    "In the future, not to say one hundred jin per year, but just say fifty jin, plus the original yield, in ten years it will exceed one thousand jin, right?"
    The old man was stunned, looking at the crowd, who were smiling at him; looking at the district chief, who was also smiling at him; and then looking at the surrounding wheat fields: Heavens! This is not a wheat field, this is a golden sea! This sea, with the breeze, is turning up golden waves, sending a burst of fragrance.
    His face grew longer and longer, and his eyes became moist again. Finally, he turned his face to Wang Huainan again, and said in a trembling voice:
    "Director, I won't talk about death anymore, I want to live another ten years! But, speaking of living, I also have to ask you for some wheat ears."
    "What else do you want wheat ears for?" Wang Huainan asked with wide eyes.
    "What for?" The old man glanced at the district chief. "I, I want to take them back and wrap them up carefully in red paper, with the year, yield, and how it was produced written on them – how there was a District Chief Wang, who helped us like a god... Also, how this old man didn't believe it at first, and then how... I want my future generations to know when people started not being poor!"
    When he said these last two sentences, he was looking at the sky, and he spoke with great vigor.
    "Ha, that sounds more like it!"
    "This year, the wheat in all our villages has increased production and achieved high yields. We should all keep such a souvenir."
    "We should wrap such a package every year, with words written on it, for ten years, a hundred years later..."
    People were again chattering and buzzing.
    A middle-aged woman suddenly jumped onto a large rock by the edge of the field and shouted at the top of her lungs:
    "I have a proposal: let's have every director and team leader present today take back three wheat ears to keep as a souvenir, does everyone agree?"
    "Agree! Agree!" People roared like thunder, and some even started clapping.
    "It's good, but I'm afraid Director Wang will be reluctant." Someone said loudly, laughing.
    Wang Huainan was really a little reluctant - not because he was pained by the wheat, but because he was pained that the yield figures would suffer a little loss as a result.
    District Chief Wang's thinking was different from his. He felt that this was a very good publicity method. He even thought that this experience could be accepted, and in the autumn of this year, a district-wide harvest exhibition could be held. So, he said to everyone:
    "I agree with her opinion, but everyone should not pluck randomly, only three per person are allowed, otherwise the yield will suffer losses."
    So, everyone bent down and started to act.
    Old Man Li was made even more excited by everyone's enthusiasm, and determined to make everyone even happier, so he shouted loudly, rolled up his sleeves, bent down and grabbed the wheat ears, making a great effort to pinch them off. Every time he pinched one, he held it up to the sun to shine on it, and then put the wheat stalk in his mouth, letting the wheat ears sway against his cheeks. By the time he had pinched ten or so, the wheat ears on both sides of his mouth almost completely covered his face, revealing only his snow-white eyebrows and a pair of happy, shining eyes. Only then did he straighten up, push through the crowd, put on the posture of a wealthy landlord, bent his legs, braced his arms, stuck out his belly, wiggled his shoulders, and walked step by step to the other end of the field, picked up the dung fork and manure basket, waved them, and walked towards the village.
    People bent over with laughter, laughing until tears came out of their eyes. This laughter, accompanied by the rustling sound of the wheat field caused by the wind, formed a wonderful music celebrating the harvest.
    District Chief Wang, watching this scene, was truly moved. He felt that as long as you sincerely work for the people, the people will give you so much joy and encouragement!... He turned his head and saw Wang Huainan looking into the distance, smiling with a wide mouth. The muscles on his face were twitching, probably because he had the same feelings in his heart.

    麦穗
    ——建设山区的人们之三
    秦兆阳
    王淮南和王区长带着参观的人们来到地边，人们绕着地头站成了一条线，都瞪着眼，拉长了脸，好半天谁也不说话，大家都被这片麦子惊呆了。
    这块麦子确实好得出奇：弯着腰看去，秆儿挺粗挺短，密的没了缝儿；穗儿又大又长，都一般齐，麦芒儿的金光耀得睁不开眼，真像一条金色的大羊毛毯子。站直了身子看去，只看见密密的麦穗，看不见秆儿，更看不见地土，简直像是把穗儿都掐下来了晒在场上的一样。
      “这不是种的麦子，这是种的麦子囤！”
    不知是谁自言自语地说了这么一句，立刻引起了一片嚷嚷声：
    “这也不是种的麦子囤，是种的金子！”
      “你猜这三亩地能打多少？”
    “每亩地少不了六百斤，三六一千八……”
    “六百？七百斤我也不让给你！”
    “王社长，你们自个估计估计能打多少？”
    王淮南摸着短胡子楂儿笑着，压着自己心里的兴奋劲儿，故意又低又慢地说：
    “嘿嘿，俺们原计划是每亩八百斤，只因社员们起先没信心，不愿费事，少刨了一遍，后来又受了一场雹灾，估计只能达到七百五……”
    “好家伙！”有人吐了下舌头，轻声叫起来。
    多数的人们都沉默了，都对着麦地眯细了眼睛，也许是对王淮南的话表示默认，也许是还有些不相信。有的人因为是对着太阳看的，嫌麦芒耀得眼花，就转到那边去站着。有一位研究家——是邻村的一个互助组长，他不声不响地离开了人群，走到地那头去，对着麦地把腰弯了又弯，最后竟爬到地上，半天才起来，又慢慢地走了回来，不住地点着头，好像明白了其中的奥妙似的。
    有人问他：“你瞅出什么‘章程’来了？”
    “哼，”他说：“老辈子都说庄稼要通风，你看这麦子，密得挤出了汗……”
      “我看是你那心窍儿要通风！”别人讽刺地打断了他的话。
    他没有理会这个讽刺，又弯下腰去，用手量着麦垄之间的距离。
    这时，在四下里耪地的人们也都放下了活儿，扛着锄走了过来，把地头上靠河边的一块空地方都挤满了。他们都是本村的人，不知道到这块地里来看过多少回，今天看见全区许多干部来参观，又听说王淮南社里明天就要动镰收割这块麦子了，所以还愿意来“过”最后一回“瘾”。
    人一多，嚷嚷声就更热闹了。
    从那边汽车路上，来了一个背着粪筐的老头，他走得那么快，像有什么急事似的，走到地头上，把粪筐和粪?往地上一扔，分开众人，一把抓住王淮南的胳膊，大声说道：
    “社长，我有个事！……”
    “啥事？”王淮南吃了一惊。
    老人说：“这虽说是我的地，可既是入了社，是社里种的麦子，我就得问问你：你让我掐几个麦穗儿不？”
    这老头姓李。开始在他这块地里试种密植良种小麦的时候，他儿子同意，他不同意，父子俩为这事差点吵起来。后来麦苗儿出来了，他一看见比别的地里的长得慢，就常对人说：“要打八百斤？要掺上沙子八千斤也到了！”他天天背着粪筐上这地里看两遍，总是不放心。开春以后，苗儿渐渐长得旺了起来，他还是说：“种得这么稠，不烂掉才怪呢，等着吃麦秸吧！”以后，麦子莠穗儿了，社里适时地用谷糠上了一回追肥，这就跟别的麦子比出优劣来了，李老头就再也不说话了，只是时常一个人站在地边上，瞅着麦子半天半天地出神。人们常说：“看嘞，老头子像地里骇鸟儿的草人儿似的，一动也不动哩。”他到底呆在那里想些什么呢？却谁也不知道。
    这时所有的人都对他的神气引起了注意，都把眼光集中到他和王淮南的身上。
    王淮南问他：“老叔，你要几根穗儿干吗？”
      “干吗？”老头子说着，向周围的人扫了一眼，像是反问别人似的。“我打早就安下了这份心：我要从这块地里掐下几根麦穗儿，好好儿的留着它，有朝一日我要死了，我要我小子把它压在我心口儿上，一起装在棺材里。”
    “老叔，你可把我弄糊涂了！”王淮南看看周围的人，笑着说。
    “怎么你还不明白？”老人生气地叫道。“你知道我这一辈子是怎么过来的？我全家五口人，就这么一块地，以往，每年每亩才打四五斗麦子。什么叫‘穷’？这就叫‘穷’！穷，穷，穷得我不相信地还有这大的力量，能长出这么多东西来！抗战那工夫，”他转向大家，又望了望王区长，索性像演讲一样地说开了，“政府提倡组织起来，增加生产，我就不大信。以后，组织起来了，我这地年年收成加多，多到每亩打一担麦子，解放以后又到一担五。我心想：咱们山里的地，比不得平原上，这可算到了头儿啦，没的再‘增’的啦！……可是你们看，这，这是麦子吗？这不是粮仓，是粮矿，是金子！我想不过穷日子想了几十年，今日这算盼到头儿啦！我要，把麦穗压在我胸口上，我躺在棺材里，我那鬼魂，睡醒了摸摸它，我就放心了，就高兴了，我这一辈子总算见过金子了，我那后辈子孙总算不受穷了！”
    他说完了，用发抖的手背擦着满眶的眼泪。
    人们都瞅着他，年岁大一些的人们被他的眼泪引得眼里发潮，年轻的人们却在微笑。
    “嗨呀老叔！”王淮南退后了一步，把两只大手一甩，像是要甩掉什么脏东西似的。“你活着先落个安心得啦，活还没有活够哩，就想到死的事，要是俺婶子知道了，又该叨咕你了，你真是！……”
    王淮南是个习惯了往前看的人，无论对什么事，他总是把脖子一硬，说：“咱有办法！”去年发动小麦增产运动的时候，人们都说：“光说增产，从抗战的时候增到现在了，还增？咋个增法呀！”他又说：“咱有办法！”可真正的办法他却拿不出来，急得他日夜睡不着觉。正在这时王区长到这村来了。原来，为了回答群众“咋个增法”的问题，王区长早就比他还着急，最近特地要求到专署去受了一趟农业技术训练。于是，他们对全村的人宣布：产量可以增加，穷困可以克服。他们发动全村全社的人平均每亩增产一百斤，并在社里订了三亩高额丰产的计划。……
    丰产计划是订了，麦子也种下了，但王淮南自己是不是有着百分之百的信心呢？他相信上级，相信将来比现在强，希望这一丰产计划能够实现，但在自己的内心深处，对这三亩麦子总是十分耽心。特别是不断地听到像李老头这样人说的泄气话，心里就更不断地敲小鼓。谁也不知道：他曾经几次半夜里拿着尺子到这地里来量麦秆儿。一个多月以前下大雨和下雹子的那一夜，他到地里来看了三趟，第三趟来时天已亮了，正碰见王区长从那边大路上来了，王区长是淋着雨摸着黑赶了二十里路来的。他们一块儿走到地边，又一块儿被这麦子抵抗天灾的能力所感动，当时他们心里的喜欢劲儿，是谁也不知道的。
    现在，老王很想趁机会对着李老头子把自己的胜利心情和欢喜劲儿发泄一下，长篇大论说上一顿。
    “老叔，你那脑筋也该开一开啦！”——不想他刚说了这么一句，就被王区长的话打断了。
    王区长两步走到老人跟前，问他：
    “老大伯，你今年多大岁数啦？”
    “六十二啦。”老人伸出手来比了个手势。
    “你再活十年也不算多吧？你就等着看好时候吧！”王区长笑着，捏住了老人的手，使劲摇着。他是同情老人，同时又被自己的乐观心情所激动。
    “哈哈！”王淮南大声笑着，又找到了发泄的机会了。“再过十年，俺社里要做不到平均每亩一千多斤才怪呢！”
    “每亩一千多？是你说的？”老人急忙摆脱了区长的手，跳到王淮南跟前，瞅住他的脸。
    “是我说的！”王淮南把身子一仰，拍着胸脯叫起来，是表示自己的愿望，也是表示自己的决心。
    “哈哈！”老人忽然也把两手猛力一甩，“那你可得把每块地的地边子都围上囤啦，要不粮食就流撒了哇！天啦，嘿嘿嘿嘿……”他眯起眼来看着天，从心底里笑了出来。“嗨呀，嗨呀，我但指望能活到那个时候哇！”
    “老叔你别笑，”王淮南又故意绷住脸说。“你说，咱全村全社今年每亩增产一百斤的计划能实现不？”
    老人往周围地里扫了一眼，收住了笑容：
    “看现在这麦子的情况，差不离。”
    “往后每年不说一百斤，就说五十斤吧，加上原有的产量，十年以后也超过了一千斤吧？”
    老人愣住了，看看众人，众人在对他微笑；看看区长，区长也在对他微笑；再看看四野的麦地：喝！这不是麦地，这是金色的海！这海随着微风翻着金色的波浪，送来一阵阵的香气。
    他的脸越拉越长了，眼里又潮湿了。最后，又把脸转向王淮南，哆嗦着声儿说：
    “社长，我不说死的事儿啦，我要再活十年！可是，说活着，我也得向你要点麦穗。”
    “你还要麦穗干啥呢？”王淮南瞪大了眼问。
    “干啥？”老人扫了区长一眼。“我，我要把它拿回去，用红纸好好儿包起来，上面写着年月，产量，咋的产出来的——咋的有个王区长，他像神仙一样，帮俺……还有，我老头子起先咋的不信，后来又咋的……我要让后辈子孙知道，人们是从啥时候起才不受穷的！”
    他说这最后两句话时，眼睛看着天，说得非常有劲。
    “哈，这还像个话！”
    “今年咱们村村的麦子都有增产丰产的，都应该像这么留个纪念。”
    “应该年年包这么个包儿，包儿上面都写上字，十年百年以后……”
    人们又都七嘴八舌地轰轰开了。
    一个中年妇女，突然跳到地边的一块大石头上去，扯着嗓子叫道：
      “我有个提议：咱们今日到场的每个社长组长们，每人带回三根麦穗去，留个纪念，大伙同意不同意呀？”
    “同意！同意！”人们像打雷似地哄嚷起来了，有些人还拍起手来。
    “好是好，就怕王社长舍不得。”又有人大声笑着说。
    王淮南真有些舍不得——不是心痛麦子，是心痛产量数目会因此受点损失。
    王区长的想法却跟他不一样。他觉得这是个很好的宣传办法，他甚至于想到：可以接受这一经验，到今年秋后，开一个全区的丰收展览会。于是，他对大家说：
    “我同意她的意见，可是大伙不要乱掐，只准一人三根，多了产量就受损失。”
    于是，众人都弯下腰去动起手来。
    李老头子被大家的热情弄得更加兴奋了，决心要使大伙更加乐一场，就大叫一声，把袖子一卷，弯下腰去抓住麦穗，装出使大劲的样子，狠命地掐着。每掐一根，举起来对着太阳照一照，然后把麦秆叼在嘴里，让麦穗搔着腮帮子晃动着。等到掐了十来根时，嘴两边的麦穗几乎把他的脸全遮住了，只露出雪白的眉毛和一对愉快的放光的眼睛。他这才直起身来，分开众人，装出大肚子老财的身架，弯着腿，架着膀子，挺着肚子，颠动着肩膀，一步一步地走到地那头去，拿起粪?粪筐，举起来舞动着，走向村子里去了。
    人们笑弯了腰，笑出了眼泪。这笑声伴着麦地里因风而起的沙沙声，形成了一种奇妙的庆祝丰收的音乐。
    王区长看着这情形，他是真正地被感动着。他觉得：只要诚诚恳恳地给人民作事，人民会给你多么大的喜悦和鼓舞啊！……他一回头，看见王淮南看着远处，在裂着大嘴笑着。脸上的肌肉却在抽动，大概他心里也有着同样的感受。
