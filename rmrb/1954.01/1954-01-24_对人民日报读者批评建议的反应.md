Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central Government Examines Errors in Post Office Work Based on Readers' Criticisms

Letter from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government: On August 19th of last year, the "Reader's Letters in Brief" column of the People's Daily published four letters from readers criticizing post office work under the title "Postal Organizations in Various Regions Should Further Improve Letter Delivery Work." We have instructed the relevant postal and telecommunications administrations to conduct inspections. The basic reason for these errors is the poor quality of work in the post offices and the irresponsibility of some staff members. For example, the incident revealed by a reader in which a letter addressed to the Public Security Department of Liaodong Province was mistakenly sent to the Public Security Department of Guangdong Province was caused by the carelessness of the person handling it in the Guangzhou Post Office, who did not carefully review the letter. The problem of a misdirected letter being passed back and forth through several post offices without being discovered was due to the fact that the handlers in the relevant units of the Beijing Post Office did not conduct a careful study when approving and returning the letter. As for the problem of the reader Zhao Pingshu's remittance at the Xian County Post Office not being found after more than a year, after inspection by the Hebei Postal and Telecommunications Administration and the Beijing Post Office, it was found that the registered letter containing the remittance form had already been properly delivered to the North China People's Magazine. Because the remitter had not received the magazine for a long time and inquired about it, the Xian County Post Office also sent the receipt signed by the North China People's Magazine, which was found by the Beijing Post Office, to the receiving and dispatching room of Xian County Middle School. Due to the backlog of receipts in the receiving and dispatching room, the problem was delayed and could not be clarified. In addition, regarding the problem of backlog of letters in the Yanyuan Post and Telecommunications Bureau, because the bureau's inspection was not thorough, we have instructed them to conduct a more in-depth inspection.

Regarding the above errors, the relevant postal bureaus, in addition to ordering the responsible personnel to conduct self-criticism, have also carried out education among the majority of employees to eliminate errors. We are also launching a patriotic labor competition in the postal and telecommunications system, with the main content being to improve the quality of postal and telecommunications work, and strengthening political and ideological education for employees to cultivate a serious and responsible service attitude in order to correct this undesirable phenomenon.

Anda County Coal Industry Construction Materials Company
Takes Effective Measures to Avoid Shipping Errors

Letter from Anda County Coal Industry Construction Materials Company, Heilongjiang Province: On November 8th of last year, the People's Daily "Reader's Letters in Brief" column published a "Reader's Letters Summary" entitled "State-Owned Commercial Institutions Should Avoid Errors in Shipping and Receiving Goods," which criticized our company for mis-shipping kerosene. We would like to inform you of the inspection results and handling situation:

In April of last year, the Qinggang Department Store called for kerosene. Our company's business section shipped it to Qinggang on May 4th through the Anda County Transportation Company, but mistakenly wrote the consignee as the Qinggang County Cooperative Union. Later, the Qinggang County Department Store sent a letter urging delivery, but Wang Xuefu, the head of our company's business section, dismissed it, saying, "This is the fault of the transportation company." After the Qinggang County Department Store urged again, our company sent Comrade Jiang Tianlai from the business section to the transportation company for inspection, only to learn the actual situation. Then, on September 20th, the payment was refunded to the Qinggang County Department Store.

The main reasons for this error were the irresponsibility of the staff handling the matter in our company and the unsoundness of the procedural system. In order to eliminate errors, we have adopted the following measures: First, implement a dedicated responsibility system for shipping, where the commodity manager submits a commodity consignment notice and then goes to the transportation company to complete the consignment procedures. Second, implement a commodity receipt return form, where the shipping unit fills out a triplicate form, recording the commodity type, quantity, amount, and name of the consignee. The consignee returns the return form after verifying that the goods are correct. This will be used to settle accounts with the finance department, preventing mis-shipments or other accidents that may occur during transportation.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    中央邮电部根据读者批评检查邮局工作中的差错事件
    中央人民政府邮电部来信：去年八月十九日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏以“各地邮政机构应该进一步做好信件投递工作”为题刊载了四封读者对邮局工作的批评信。我们已指示各有关邮电管理局进行检查。发生这些差错的基本原因是邮局工作质量低劣，某些工作人员对工作不负责任。如读者揭发的一封寄往辽东省公安厅的信被误寄到广东省公安厅的事件，就是广州邮局经手人工作粗枝大叶、没有认真复核信件所造成的。一封错投信件经过几个邮局往返传递而没被发现的问题，则是北京邮局有关单位的经手人在批信、退信时没有进行认真研究所致。至于读者赵平舒在献县邮局汇款一年多查不到下落的问题，经河北邮电管理局及北京邮局检查，装寄汇票的挂号信早已妥投华北人民杂志社；汇款人因久未收到杂志而查询后，献县邮局也将北京邮局查到的华北人民杂志社签收回执投送献县中学收发室；由于回执被收发室积压，致使问题拖延不能弄清。此外，盐源邮电局积压信件问题，因该局检查不彻底，我们去责成他们再作深入检查。
    对于以上差错事件，各有关邮电局除责成主管人员进行检讨外，还向广大职工进行了消灭差错的教育。我们也正以提高邮电工作质量为主要内容，在邮电系统展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛，并对职工加强政治思想教育，使职工树立认真负责的服务态度，以纠正这种不良现象。
    安达县煤业建筑器材公司
    采取有效措施避免发货差错
    黑龙江省安达县煤业建筑器材公司来信：去年十一月八日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏发表了以“国营商业机构发货收货应避免差错”为题的“读者来信综述”，对我公司错发煤油事件提出批评。现将检查结果和处理情况告诉你们：
    去年四月份青岗百货公司来电话要煤油，我公司业务股于五月四日经安达县运输公司发往青岗，但将收货单位误写成青岗县合作社联合社。后来青岗县百货公司来信催问，我公司业务股长王学富反说“这是运输公司的错误”而置之不理。经青岗县百货公司再次催问，我公司派业务股姜天来同志到运输公司检查，才了解了实际情况，遂于九月二十日将货款退还青岗县百货公司。
    这个错误的发生，主要原因是我公司经办人员工作不负责任和手续制度不健全。为了杜绝错误，我们已采取以下办法：一、贯彻发货专责制，由商品主管人员提出商品托运通知，再到运输公司办理托运手续。二、实行商品收货回报单，由发货单位填写三联单，记载商品品种、数量、金额、收货单位名称；收货单位将货物验收无讹后将回报单寄回，凭此通过财务结算，防止误发或在运送途中可能发生的其它事故。
