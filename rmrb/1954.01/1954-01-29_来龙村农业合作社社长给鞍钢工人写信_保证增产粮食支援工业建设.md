Lai Long Village Agricultural Cooperative Chairman Writes to Anshan Iron and Steel Workers
Guaranteeing Increased Grain Production to Support Industrial Construction
Comrades of Anshan Iron and Steel Company:

Seeing your exemplary deeds of actively producing for the country's socialist industrialization in the newspapers often makes me deeply aware of the greatness of the working class. We peasants are determined to follow the workers step by step to transition to socialism and live a happy and fulfilling life.

We organized mutual aid teams in the spring of 1951, and production increased year by year. Last year, we established an agricultural production cooperative, and production increased by more than 20% compared to the year before. The income of cooperative members has increased. When the government called on farmers to sell surplus grain, our cooperative sold more than 10,000 jin of millet and motivated mutual aid teams and individual farmers throughout the village to sell grain.

Why were the cooperative members so enthusiastic about selling grain? At first, some cooperative members did not know what industrial construction was about, did not understand how national industrial development would benefit them, and were unwilling to sell grain. We then discussed the general line in connection with actual life. I first told everyone about seeing machines planting crops when I attended the Provincial Labor Model Conference in Chengdu last spring, and then I brought up the benefits of using sprayers and threshing machines in our cooperative. In the past, the vegetables we planted often had insects, and we couldn't catch them all by hand. Now, after spraying "666" powder with sprayers, the insects have been greatly reduced, and we get a good yield for every planting. In the past, we used old-fashioned flails for threshing, and four full laborers could only thresh twelve loads of grain a day at most, and there was a lot of waste. Now we use a threshing machine, and two full laborers and four half laborers can thresh at least thirty-two loads a day, and there is very little waste. Looking at it from the perspective of life, due to industrial development in recent years, the prices of industrial products have also dropped a lot. In the past, it took two sheng of rice to buy one jin of salt, and four sheng of rice to buy one chi of indanthrene cloth. Now, one sheng of rice can buy more than two jin of salt, and a little more than one sheng of rice can buy one chi of indanthrene cloth. These vivid facts made everyone clearly realize that industrial development can bring great benefits to farmers. Everyone hopes that the worker elder brothers will make better machines (such as tractors) for us to use in the future. At the same time, everyone also realized that the more industry develops, the more grain and other cash crops are needed. Our responsibility as farmers is to increase production and sell the surplus grain to the state, and if we want to increase production, we can only take the path of organization. Therefore, everyone happily sold the grain, and the enthusiasm for increasing production through organization has also generally increased. Some mutual aid teams in our village that had originally disbanded have resumed their activities; some individual farmers are also actively requesting to join mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Recently, five cooperative members who had withdrawn from the cooperative and many individual farmers have requested to join our cooperative. We are organizing them to study and plan to absorb them, so that everyone's production can be improved and their lives can be improved.

Currently, the spring crops in our village have generally been weeded once or twice, and the water in the fields and ponds is well managed. We have deposited most of the money from selling grain into the bank, and we plan to withdraw it when we need it for production.

Comrades of Anshan Iron and Steel Company: We hope that you will produce more steel so that the country will soon have the conditions to manufacture a large number of agricultural machines to help us improve production. We also guarantee to run the agricultural production cooperative well, and lead other farmers to take the bright road of organization, and continuously increase grain production to support you, and build the country together with you.

### 来龙村农业合作社社长给鞍钢工人写信  保证增产粮食支援工业建设

　　来龙村农业合作社社长给鞍钢工人写信
　　保证增产粮食支援工业建设鞍山钢铁公司的工人同志们：
    在报纸上经常看到你们为了国家社会主义工业化而积极生产的模范事迹，这使我深刻地认识到工人阶级的伟大。我们农民坚决跟着工人一步一步地过渡到社会主义，过幸福美满的生活。
    我们在一九五一年春天组织了互助组，生产一年比一年提高；去年我们成立了农业生产合作社，生产又比前年提高了百分之二十多。社员们的收入都增加了。政府号召农民卖余粮时，我们社里卖出一万多斤黄谷，并且带动了全村的互助组和单干农民纷纷卖粮。
    社员们为什么这样踊跃地卖粮呢？一开始，有些社员不晓得工业建设是怎么一回事，不懂得国家工业发展了对自己有什么好处，不愿意卖粮。我们就联系实际生活对总路线进行了讨论。我先把去年春天在成都开省劳动模范会时看到用机器种庄稼的情形讲给大家听，接着又提出我们社里用喷雾器和打谷机的好处。过去我们种的蔬菜经常生虫，用手捉根本捉不完；现在用喷雾器喷洒了“六六六”药粉，虫子大大减少了，真是种一窝得一窝。过去我们打谷用的是旧式挞斗，每天四个全劳动力顶多才能打十二挑谷子，并且抛撒很大；现在我们用打谷机，两个全劳动力和四个半劳动力每天至少也能打上三十二挑，还很少有抛撒。再从生活方面来看吧，这几年由于工业发展了，工业品的价格也降低了很多。过去要两升米才能买上一斤盐，四升米才能扯一尺阴丹士林布；现在一升米就能买两斤多盐，一升多米就能扯上一尺阴丹士林布。这些活生生的事实使大家都明确地认识了工业发展给农民能带来很大的好处。大家都希望以后工人老大哥造出更好的机器（如拖拉机）来给我们用。同时，大家也认识了：工业越发展，需要的粮食和其它经济作物就越多，我们农民的责任就是要增加生产，并把余粮卖给国家，而要想多增产就只有走组织起来的道路。因此，大家愉快地卖出了粮食，组织起来增产的积极性也普遍高涨。我们村上有些原来已经散伙的互助组已恢复起来活动了；有些单干农民也积极要求参加互助合作组织；最近，有五户已退社的社员和不少单干农民要求参加我们合作社。我们正在组织他们学习，打算吸收他们，好让大家的生产都搞好，生活都改善。
    目前我们村里的小春作物普遍薅了一、二道，田头和塘头的水也都关得很好。我们把卖粮的钱大部分都存入了银行，准备等生产需要时再取出来。
    鞍钢的工人同志们：希望你们生产更多的钢铁，以便国家早日有条件制造大量农业机器，帮助我们提高生产。我们也保证把农业生产合作社搞好，并带动其他农民走组织起来的光明道路，不断增产粮食来支援你们，跟着你们一道把国家建设好。
    四川璧山县八区城西乡来龙村农业生产合作社社长  陶树辉
