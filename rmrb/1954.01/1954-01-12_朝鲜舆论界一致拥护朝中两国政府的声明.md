Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 11th: Korean public opinion unanimously supports the statements issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Nam Il respectively regarding the resumption of bilateral talks on the issue of the Korean Political Conference.

    The "Rodong Sinmun" stated in an editorial on the 11th entitled "The Bilateral Talks on the Political Conference Issue Must Be Resumed Quickly": The governments of Korea and China have consistently adhered to a policy of peace and a position of resolving the Korean issue through peaceful consultation, and now, once again, have taken the initiative to make tremendous efforts to resume the bilateral talks. The editorial said: Issues such as the handling of prisoners of war and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue urgently need to be resolved by the Korean Political Conference, and the Political Conference cannot be allowed to be delayed any longer. If the U.S. side still has a shred of sincerity in striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it must immediately agree to resume the bilateral talks. As the governments of Korea and China pointed out in their statements, the fair and reasonable comprehensive proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides on November 30, 1953, can serve as the basis for the two sides to continue their talks. The Korean and Chinese sides have also stated that if the U.S. side has different opinions, they can be resolved through consultation during the bilateral talks.

    The editorial then pointed out: The United Nations cannot turn a blind eye to the dangerous situation in Korea. If the United Nations is still willing to fulfill the tasks stipulated in its Charter, it should seek ways to resolve the above-mentioned situation; when the United Nations General Assembly discusses the Korean issue, representatives of the governments of Korea and China must be allowed to participate. At the same time, all the Korean people warmly support the Soviet government's proposal for convening a meeting of the five major powers, and are determined to rise up and complete the tasks they bear in the struggle to ease international tensions. We warmly support the statements of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government of the People's Republic of China, and solemnly watch the actions of the U.S. side.

    The "Democratic Korea" newspaper stated in the same day's editorial: The statements of Foreign Minister Nam Il and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai once again embody the sincerity and consistent efforts of the Korean and Chinese peoples to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and strictly implement the Korean Armistice Agreement. Today, as the world's forces for peace continue to grow, if the U.S. side still attempts to forcibly detain prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated and undermine the convening of the Political Conference, then they are bound to suffer an irreparable defeat. The editorial emphasized: The Korean people hope that the U.S. side will immediately resume talks with our side and conduct sincere consultations in this meeting for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    朝鲜舆论界一致拥护朝中两国政府的声明
   【新华社平壤十一日电】朝鲜舆论界一致拥护周恩来外交部长和南日外务相分别就恢复关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈发表的声明。
    “劳动新闻”十一日在题为“必须迅速恢复关于政治会议问题的双方会谈”的社论中指出：朝中两国政府一贯坚持和平政策与以和平协商方法解决朝鲜问题的立场，现在又一次对双方会谈的恢复主动地作了巨大的努力。社论说：关于战俘问题的处理与朝鲜问题的和平解决等问题现都亟待朝鲜政治会议加以解决，政治会议不能容许再被拖延。如果美方还有为和平解决朝鲜问题而努力的一点诚意，那就必须立即同意恢复双方会谈。正如朝中两国政府在声明中指出的一样，朝中方面一九五三年十一月三十日所提的公平合理的全面建议，是可以作为双方继续会谈的基础的。朝中方面并已表示，美方倘有不同的见解，可在双方会谈中通过协商的办法解决。
    社论接着指出：联合国对于朝鲜的危险局势是不能熟视无睹的。联合国如果还愿意实践宪章所规定给它的任务，就应谋求解决上述局势的办法；联合国大会如讨论朝鲜问题时，必须让朝中两国政府的代表参加。同时，全体朝鲜人民都热烈支持苏联政府关于召开五大国会议的建议，并决心奋起完成自己在缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中所担负的任务。我们热烈拥护朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府的声明，并严正地注视着美方的行动。
    “民主朝鲜报”在同一天的社论中指出：南日外务相和周恩来外交部长的声明，又一次体现了朝中两国人民和平解决朝鲜问题与严格执行朝鲜停战协定的诚意及其所作的一贯努力。在世界和平力量进一步增长的今天，美方如果仍然企图强迫扣留不直接遣返的战俘、破坏政治会议的召开，那么他们是必定要遭到不可挽救的失败的。社论强调说：朝鲜人民希望美方立即恢复与我方的会谈，并在这个会谈中为和平解决朝鲜问题而进行有诚意的协商。
