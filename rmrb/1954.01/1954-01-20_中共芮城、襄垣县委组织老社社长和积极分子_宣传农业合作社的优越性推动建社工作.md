The CCP committees of Ruicheng and Xiangyuan counties, Shanxi Province, after extensively publicizing the general line, have seen a continuous increase in the number of mutual aid teams and individual farmers requesting to join or establish cooperatives. In Ruicheng, 190 mutual aid teams have requested approval to transition into cooperatives. To further enhance farmers' understanding of agricultural producers' cooperatives, in late December of last year, the county CCP committees of both counties dispatched veteran cooperative leaders and activists to the countryside to conduct in-depth propaganda through real people and real events.

The Ruicheng County CCP Committee selected 22 people, including cooperative leaders, activists, and resident cadres from seven veteran cooperatives, and formed eight groups to conduct propaganda in various townships. The Xiangyuan County CCP Committee selected a total of 36 cooperative leaders with rich experience in establishing cooperatives to give reports in different areas.

The results were significant from the first few days of the campaign. Qu Laijin, the leader of the agricultural producers' cooperative in Dianshang Township, Sixth District, Xiangyuan County, gave a report in a neighboring village, and 70 percent of the farmers in Dianshang Village actively requested to establish a cooperative. Cui You, the leader of the Hezhang Village agricultural producers' cooperative, reported the achievements of his cooperative to farmers in nearby villages, resulting in 12 teams, comprising 138 households, expressing their intention to improve their teams in preparation for establishing a cooperative, and 79 individual farmers requesting to join teams. Li Fulin, the leader of the Da Haogou agricultural producers' cooperative, reported in Beimen Street, Chengguan Township, how his cooperative overcame serious natural disasters last year and achieved a bumper harvest, and made comparisons with farmers outside the cooperative, deeply moving the farmers who listened to the report. In the first two days of their reports, the leaders of the Ruicheng County cooperatives answered 53 questions from the masses regarding the establishment of cooperatives. Many cadres and activists said, "This is better than receiving training," and "This time, we really understand the situation."

The experience of Ruicheng County proves that, to adopt this method of promotion, full preparation must be made in advance. Before the cooperative leaders and activists dispatched by the county went to the countryside to conduct propaganda, they were led personally by the director of the Propaganda Department of the County CCP Committee and concentrated for four days of preparation. During the preparation, they first criticized complacency, organized everyone to study diligently, and conducted collective research. They gathered the general public's thoughts on participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives, jointly studied the central content of the report, and then prepared specifically through the real materials of their own cooperatives. As a result, significant results were achieved.

    中共芮城、襄垣县委组织老社社长和积极分子
    宣传农业合作社的优越性推动建社工作
    经过大张旗鼓宣传总路线以后，山西芮城、襄垣两县要求入社和办社的互助组、个体农民不断增加，芮城已有一百九十个互助组要求批准转社。为进一步提高农民对农业生产合作社的认识，去年十二月下旬，两县中共县委先后抽调老社社长和积极分子，分头下乡，以活人活事深入地进行宣传。
    芮城县委抽调了七个老社的社长、积极分子和驻社干部二十二人，组成八个小组到各乡宣传。襄垣县委共抽调了三十六个办社有丰富经验的社长，分片作报告。
    从最初几天的宣传情况看，收效就很大。襄垣六区店上乡农业生产合作社社长曲来金，到邻村作了一次报告，店上自然村就有百分之七十的农民积极要求办社。合漳村农业生产合作社社长崔优给附近村农民报告了办社的成绩，就有十二个组一百三十八户表示要办好组，准备建社；七十九户个体农民要求入组。大郝沟农业生产合作社社长李富林在城关乡北门街报告了他的社去年如何战胜严重的天灾取得丰收，并和社外农民作了比较，使听报告的农民深为感动。芮城县合作社社长在头两天报告中，共解答了群众提出的五十三件办社的疑难问题，许多干部和积极分子都说：“真比受训强”，“这一下可摸底了。”
    芮城县的经验证明：采用这种宣传方式，必须事先有充分的准备。该县抽调的社长和积极分子在下乡宣传前，曾由县委宣传部部长亲自领导，集中做了四天的准备工作。在准备中，首先批判了自满思想，组织大家认真学习，集体研究。他们集中了一般群众对参加农业生产合作社的思想情况，共同研究了报告的中心内容，然后再通过自己社的活材料，进行具体准备。结果收到了很大成效。
