Experiences of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau in Organizing the Work of Soviet Experts
	Wang Tao, Chief of the Production Technology Department of the Central Iron and Steel Industry Bureau

Last year, the Central Iron and Steel Industry Bureau gained valuable experience in organizing the work of Soviet experts and implementing their recommendations.

Last spring, the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau conducted a special inspection of the organization of Soviet expert work and the implementation of Soviet expert recommendations. It was found that in the past, this extremely important work was not tightly grasped. There was no dedicated person in charge and no necessary supervision and inspection system. As a result, many factories and mines below did not seriously lead this work. Individual leading cadres and some technical cadres even did not pay attention to or actively implement the experts' recommendations. At the same time, the previous organization of expert work lacked focus and a practical, thorough plan. Experts were only invited after problems occurred in factories and mines. Therefore, the experts were busy running around, only able to treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. Sometimes, they could not even cope with the situation, which diverted the experts' energy and prevented them from systematically solving key production problems. Based on the above situation, the leadership of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau made new arrangements for organizing the work of experts and took the following measures:

	First, under the leadership of the Production Technology Department, the Rationalization Proposal Section was strengthened to be responsible for all daily organizational work related to expert work, to comprehensively organize records and materials of major suggestions made by experts, and to supervise and urge factories and mines to implement major expert suggestions. At the same time, factories and mines were also instructed to designate technical functional departments to be responsible for organizing expert work.

	Second, together with Soviet experts, a general outline for the annual expert work plan and work system was formulated, and specific plans for expert work were proposed on a quarterly and monthly basis. In the plan outline, according to the needs of the work, it was stipulated that in the past year, several key problems in steelmaking, coking, rolling steel, ironmaking, refractory materials, special steel, and equipment should be solved, and the time for solving each problem was determined according to the priority. The quarterly and monthly plans were made more specific and practical in combination with the central work of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's work plan, responsibility system, and the specific conditions of the factories and mines. At the same time, the bureau and its subordinate factories and mines were able to act in unison and carry out work in a prepared manner in accordance with the provisions of the plan.

	Third, key factories for Soviet experts' work were determined, so that experts could concentrate their efforts to systematically solve the problems of one factory according to the plan, gain experience, and then promote it to other factories. For example, in the first half of the year, coking and ironmaking experts focused on the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, steelmaking experts focused on the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and Tianjin Steel Plant, rolling steel experts focused on the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, refractory material experts focused on the refractory material plant of the Tangshan Steel Plant, and special steel experts focused on the Fushun Steel Plant. At the same time, the solution of major problems in other factories was not abandoned.

	Fourth, technical cadres of the same profession and some management cadres were transferred from the bureau to various factories and mines to form factory work groups, which went to the factories with the experts to work under the leadership of the responsible cadres of the factories and mines. In addition to being responsible for urging and promoting the leadership of factories and mines to organize the implementation of experts' suggestions and assisting in mobilizing workers to implement experts' suggestions, each member of the group also had to return to their original factory regularly, and in conjunction with the situation of their own factory, organize and promote the experience of key factories. This work group was also a training class accompanying the experts. The personnel participating in the work group had to systematically learn from the experts according to the experts' work plan. Up to now, the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau has organized seven such work groups, composed of more than 100 technical cadres drawn from various factories. After completing the work tasks of key factories, these work groups have successively returned to their factories to carry out promotion work.

After the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau took the above measures, it felt that the benefits of this approach were great. First of all, it can give full play to the role of Soviet experts and initially establish a normal order for expert work. Now, the experts' work is proactive, no longer rushing to solve problems only after they occur in the factory; instead, they can comprehensively consider and solve the fundamental problems in the factory, changing the past unplanned situation of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. Under the promotion and supervision of the work group, the implementation of experts' suggestions by the factories began to be carried out in an organized and led manner; moreover, because there are dedicated people responsible for promotion work, the experts' suggestions are no longer just playing a role in one factory. Due to the adoption of these measures, in the past year, in addition to helping us solve many major production technology problems, Soviet experts also put forward 1,848 important suggestions, thereby promoting various central tasks, improving enterprise management, and greatly changing the face of China's iron and steel industry. For example, due to the implementation of the suggestions of ironmaking experts, blast furnaces across the country, in addition to paying attention to the quality of major repairs, have significantly shortened the time. The Tianjin Steel Plant implemented the suggestions of steelmaking experts and created a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in five minutes and forty-eight seconds; after implementing the experts' suggestions on hot repairs, the coal consumption of the plant was reduced from 43 tons to about 33 tons, and the hot repair plan that had never been completed was completed for the first time. Under the guidance and help of experts, various special steel plants have improved the quality of special steel and have begun to produce 13 new varieties of steel. The coke produced by the Shijingshan Plant with the help of coking experts has uniform block size and improved strength, and the new product of pure toluene successfully trial-produced under its guidance has reached the specifications of Soviet standards. Rolling steel experts helped Plant 101 successfully trial-roll heavy rails, solving the difficulty of China's lack of primary rolling mills. Under the systematic guidance of refractory material experts, the manufacturing of high-quality blast furnace bricks in various factories has been significantly improved. The physical and chemical properties of the furnace bricks have reached and exceeded the national refractory material specifications, and the yield rate has also increased from 45-65% to 80-90%. The Tangshan Steel Plant implemented the experts' suggestions and improved the kiln loading method, which increased the kiln loading volume of silica bricks by 22% and the kiln loading volume of firebricks by 26-27%; in terms of coal consumption, firebricks decreased by 20-30%, and silica bricks decreased by about 10-20%. In addition, the rapid kiln firing method was implemented, which shortened the utilization coefficient of firebrick kiln firing from 15-17 days to 11-12 days, and silica bricks from 40 days to 32 days; and high-alumina bricks were successfully trial-produced, opening up a new development path for China's refractory materials. Under the guidance of equipment experts, the average time for major blast furnace repairs across the country was shortened by about 30% compared with the plan, which relatively increased the output of pig iron by 23,000 tons; and after improving the quality of furnace repairs, the extension of blast furnace life was guaranteed. The successful trial of flame spraying surface quenching in Tangshan Steel Plant has been rapidly promoted in other factories and mines. In terms of enterprise management, various experts have also given great help to various factories and mines in establishing responsibility systems, formulating work plans, adjusting labor organizations, as well as equipment maintenance, technical operations, labor protection and safety measures. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant implemented the suggestions of coking experts and changed the labor organization, which significantly improved the management level and labor efficiency. After the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was helped by rolling steel experts to improve the responsibility system, accidents were greatly reduced and the production balance rate was improved.

Secondly, another advantage of this approach is that it can quickly and effectively train a large number of technical cadres and improve the technical level of workers. In the past few months, in addition to conducting specific technical guidance in various key factories and mines, Soviet experts have also made 65 special reports, and about 6,400 technicians and technical personnel have participated in the lectures. The professional and technical level of the cadres who have worked with the experts has been significantly improved. For example, Wang Juncai, an engineer at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, has more than ten years of experience in rolling steel, but after listening to the expert's suggestion that adjusting the roughing mill pass shape can increase the capacity by 36-52%, he said: "When designing rolling mill pass shapes in the past, I didn't know that proper adjustment can greatly increase output. I only considered that the rolling mill should not break and that qualified products could be rolled out." The blast furnace workers of various steel plants, under the guidance of Soviet ironmaking experts, realized that the blast furnace air volume should be suitable for the air permeability of the furnace burden and improve the charging system, and strive to make full use of the thermal and chemical energy of the gas in the furnace. Some members of the expert work group said: "Participating in the expert work group for a few months has been more rewarding than working in the factory for three years." Many technical cadres have compiled the experts' reports, talks, and on-site instructions and are preparing to implement them after returning to the factory. The cadres who work with the experts are also greatly influenced by the experts in terms of their ideological style. They saw the refractory material experts teaching the work group while sick; they saw the steelmaking experts helping the Tianjin Steel Plant with the furnace repair work, often staying up late, from dismantling the furnace, repairing the furnace to the first furnace of steel, participating in and guiding every important step, and putting forward 153 suggestions before and after, and finally completing the furnace repair work ahead of schedule. Everyone said: "We have not only learned advanced Soviet technology, but also attended a few months of revolutionary university." Therefore, they not only actively work in key factories, but also actively promote advanced Soviet experience after returning to the factory, and strive to overfulfill the national plan.

    钢铁工业局组织苏联专家工作的经验
    钢铁工业局生产技术处长　王韬
    中央钢铁工业局去年在组织苏联专家工作和贯彻苏联专家建议方面，获得了较好的经验。
    去年春季，钢铁工业局对组织苏联专家工作和贯彻苏联专家建议的情况专门进行了一次检查，发现过去对这件极其重要的工作抓得不紧，没有专人负责和必要的督促检查制度，因此影响下面很多厂矿也没有认真领导这一工作，个别厂矿的领导干部和某些技术干部甚至不重视、不积极执行专家的建议。同时，过去组织专家的工作没有重点，没有切实的、周密的计划，总是在厂矿发生了问题之后才请专家，因此专家忙得到处跑，只能头痛医头，脚痛医脚，有时甚至连应付都应付不过来，以致分散了专家的精力，不能系统地解决生产上的关键问题。根据以上情况，钢铁工业局领导上对组织专家的工作作了新的部署，采取了以下的几项措施：
    一，在生产技术处领导下，健全合理化建议科，负责有关专家工作的一切日常组织工作，综合整理专家提出的各项重大建议的记录、资料和检查督促各厂矿对专家重大建议的执行。同时并责成厂矿指定技术职能部门负责组织专家工作。
    二，和苏联专家一起，制订全年的专家工作计划大纲和工作制度，并按季按月提出专家工作的具体计划。在计划大纲中，根据工作的需要，规定了在去年一年中，要解决炼钢，炼焦，轧钢，炼铁，耐火材料，特殊钢，以及设备等方面的若干关键问题，并分别轻重缓急，订出了解决各个问题的时间。季和月的计划，则结合重工业部的作业计划、责任制等中心工作和厂矿的具体情况，制订得更加具体和切合实际。同时，局及所属厂矿亦能行动一致，按照计划的规定有准备的进行工作。
    三，确定苏联专家工作的重点厂，使专家能集中力量按照计划主动地系统地解决一个厂的问题，取得经验，然后再推广到其他厂。例如上半年炼焦炼铁专家即以石景山钢铁厂为重点，炼钢专家以太原钢铁厂、天津钢厂等为重点，轧钢专家以太原钢铁厂为重点，耐火材料专家以唐山钢厂的耐火材料厂为重点，特殊钢专家以抚顺钢厂为重点等。与此同时，也不放弃对其他厂的重大问题的解决。
    四，从局到各厂矿抽调同一专业的技术干部及部分管理干部组织厂工作组，随同专家一起下厂，在厂矿负责干部的领导下进行工作。这个工作组除负责督促推动厂矿领导上组织执行专家的建议，协助发动职工贯彻专家的建议外，各个组员并要定期返回自己原来的工厂，结合本厂情况，组织推广重点厂的经验，这个工作组同时也是随同专家的训练班，参加工作组的人员，要按照专家的工作计划，有系统地向专家学习。到现在为止，钢铁工业局共组织了七个这样的工作组，由各厂抽调的一百余名技术干部组成。这些工作组完成了重点厂的工作任务后，已陆续返回本厂进行推广工作。
    钢铁工业局采取了上述措施之后，感到这种做法的好处很大。首先是能够充分发挥苏联专家的作用，初步建立了专家工作的正常秩序。现在，专家的工作主动了，不再是在工厂发生问题之后才赶去解决；而是可以全面地考虑和解决工厂中带根本性的问题，改变了过去头痛医头，脚痛医脚的无计划状况。工厂对专家建议的贯彻，在工作组的推动督促下，开始有组织、有领导地进行；而且，由于有专人负责做推广工作，专家的建议不再是仅仅在一个工厂中发挥作用了。由于采取了以上这些措施，在去年一年中，苏联专家除帮我们解决了许多生产技术上的重大问题之外，还提出了一八四八项重要建议，从而推动了各项中心工作，改进了企业管理，大大改变了我国钢铁工业的面貌。如由于推行了炼铁专家的建议，全国高炉除重视大修质量外时间显著缩短。天津钢厂执行炼钢专家的建议，创造了五点四十八分钟炼一炉钢的新纪录；贯彻了热修方面专家的建议后，使该厂煤耗量由四十三吨降低到三十三吨左右，并第一次完成了一向完不成的热修计划。各特殊钢厂在专家的指导帮助下，提高了特殊钢的质量，并开始生产十三种新品种的钢。炼焦专家帮石景山厂炼出的焦炭块度整齐，强度提高，而其指导试制成功的纯甲苯新产品，已达到了苏联标准的规格。轧钢专家帮一○一厂试轧重轨获得成功，解决了我国缺少初轧机的困难。在耐火材料专家的系统指导下，各厂高质量高炉砖的制造获得显著改进，理化性质的炉砖达到并超过了全国耐火材料的规格，成品率亦从百分之四十五——六十五提高到百分之八十——九十。唐山钢厂贯彻了专家的建议，改进装窑方法，使矽砖装窑量提高了百分之二十二，火砖装窑量提高百分之二十六——二十七；在耗煤量方面，火砖降低百分之二十——三十，矽砖降低了百分之十——二十左右。此外还实行了快速烧窑法，使火砖烧窑的利用系数由十五——十七天缩短到十一——十二天，矽砖由四十天缩短至三十二天；并且试制成功了高铝砖，为我国耐火材料开辟了新的发展道路。在设备专家指导下，全国高炉大修时间平均较计划缩短了百分之三十左右，相对的增加了两万三千吨生铁产量；而且提高了修炉质量后，使延长高炉寿命有了保证。并在唐山钢厂试验喷焰表面淬火成功，已在其他厂矿迅速地推广着。在企业管理方面，各个专家对各厂矿建立责任制、制定作业计划、调整劳动组织，以及设备维护、技术操作、劳动保护和安全措施等方面也都给了很大帮助。如石景山钢铁厂执行了炼焦专家的建议，改变了劳动组织，使管理水平和劳动效率显著提高。太原钢铁厂经轧钢专家帮助健全了责任制以后，事故大为减少，提高了生产均衡率。
    其次，这种做法还有一个好处，就是可以迅速有效地培养大批技术干部，提高职工的技术水平。这几个月中，苏联专家在各重点厂矿中除进行具体的技术指导外，还先后做了六十五次专题报告，参加听课的技术工人和技术人员约六千四百余人。和专家一起工作过的干部，业务技术水平显著地提高了。如太原钢铁厂的王均才工程师在轧钢方面有十几年的经验，但有一次听了专家对调整粗轧机孔型可以提高能力百分之三十六——五十二的建议后说：“从前设计轧辊孔型，哪里知道调整适当可以大大提高产量，只考虑轧辊别断，能轧出合格的产品就完了。”各钢铁厂的高炉工作者经过苏联炼铁专家的指导，认识了高炉风量应适合炉料透气性及改善装料制度，争取充分利用炉内煤气热能与化学能的问题。有的专家工作组组员说：“参加专家工作组几个月，比在厂工作三年收获还大。”很多技术干部都把专家的报告，谈话和在现场的指示整理出来，准备回厂后贯彻执行。和专家一起工作的干部，在思想作风上也受到专家很大的影响。他们看到耐火材料专家抱病给工作组上课；看到炼钢专家帮助天津钢厂进行修炉工作时，经常深夜不睡，从拆炉、修炉直到第一炉出钢，每个重要步骤都亲自参加指导，前后提出了一百五十三项建议，终于使修炉工作提前完成。大家都说：“我们不但学习了苏联的先进技术，而且上了几个月革命大学。”因此，他们不仅在重点厂里积极地工作，并且回厂以后也积极推广苏联先进经验，争取超额完成国家计划。
