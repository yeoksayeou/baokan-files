    Adapting to the needs of national construction and compiling a good survey and design plan
    Strengthening survey and design work is an important condition for carrying out capital construction and gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization. The quality and progress of survey and design work directly affect the speed of national economic development. Because the construction of any factory or mine must first be surveyed and designed, whether the survey work can be completed on time, and whether the design drawings can be submitted on time, directly affect the date of commencement of construction and its progress. Only on the basis of doing a good job in survey and design work can the construction department plan to prepare labor, building materials, and equipment ordering, and capital construction can proceed in an orderly manner.
    At present, China's survey and design capabilities are weak, and survey and design personnel lack experience and quality, which makes the survey and design work and the requirements of national construction a major contradiction. In addition, there are still some shortcomings in our leadership of survey and design work. Many survey and design institutions have not yet been well organized, and the limited survey and design capabilities have not yet played their due role. As a result, some design departments feel that their design capabilities are insufficient, but there is a widespread phenomenon of "idling." This situation must be changed. According to the experience of various survey and design departments in 1953, the primary task to change this situation is to organize all state design departments to immediately begin compiling survey and design plans, incorporate survey and design work into the planned track, manage survey and design work according to the plan, balance design forces, and organize existing design departments to carry out work evenly. Only in this way can we overcome the blindness of survey and design work, make survey and design staff clear about their goals, improve work efficiency and quality, and ensure that tasks are completed on time. For example, the Coal Mine Design Bureau, due to the formulation of a survey and design plan, the amount of design work increased significantly in a short period of time. The workload in October 1953 alone was equal to 32.1% of the total workload for the ten months from January to October.
    At present, many design departments face some difficulties in compiling survey and design plans. These difficulties are mainly: Some design departments only have design tasks for the first half of the year, and the design tasks for the second half of the year have not yet been determined, so it is difficult to plan the annual design tasks as a whole; some design departments are affected by changes in geological plans, or failure to submit design mining quantities on time, or because the client cannot submit design data on time and guarantee the correctness of the data, thus affecting the deployment of design work; some design departments lack a clear basis for design and are prone to rework because the planning task book cannot be submitted in time, or has to be changed after it is submitted; many design departments lack experience in compiling plans and have no labor quotas, so they cannot accurately estimate the amount of design work and determine the date of delivery of design documents. The above reasons do increase the difficulty of compiling survey and design plans, but these difficulties do not mean that survey and design plans cannot be compiled.
    We must fully consider that there are many favorable conditions for compiling survey and design plans at present. These conditions are mainly: Due to the start of the Five-Year Plan, the state's planning for the national economy is gradually strengthening, and the control figures for the 1954 capital construction plan have already been issued, which creates conditions for compiling survey and design plans; the leading comrades of many design departments have realized the importance of survey and design plans from their own experiences, and believe that it is necessary to compile survey and design plans in order to overcome the blindness and passivity of work, which can better drive all design personnel to do a good job in survey and design planning; over the past year, design personnel have gradually concentrated, and specialized design institutions have been established one after another, so that survey and design plans can be systematically promoted within the design department; many design departments have more or less accumulated some design, estimation of workload, and plan-making experience, and have learned the methods of compiling survey and design plans from some advanced design institutions; the country has already formulated uniform forms and methods for compiling survey and design plans. All these favorable factors show that the basic conditions for compiling survey and design plans are available.
    In order to compile a good survey and design plan, the following issues should be noted:
    First, establish an overall concept and promote the spirit of cooperation and collaboration. Survey and design projects and their progress must be closely linked with the capital construction plan, the progress of the submission of construction drawings must be closely integrated with the construction progress, and the progress of the submission of geological data must be closely integrated with the design progress. The plans between various design departments and between various units within the design department must also be closely coordinated. To this end, when each unit determines survey and design projects and their plans, design departments, planning departments, geological departments, capital construction departments, and various units must proceed from the whole, cooperate and collaborate, help each other, take the initiative to contact each other, and jointly study and determine design projects and design plans, fully considering the needs and possibilities, and seeking consistency. The isolated viewpoint and decentralism that only care about oneself and not others must be opposed.
    Second, ensure that the design tasks of key projects are completed according to plan. At present, the design tasks of many design departments are very heavy, and there is a general feeling of insufficient manpower. Therefore, on the one hand, each design department must give full play to the enthusiasm of design personnel and tap the potential strength of the design department; on the other hand, when making plans, it must rank the tasks according to their importance and urgency, and concentrate all forces to ensure that key projects are completed on time or ahead of schedule; for minor design projects, the design procedures should be simplified, and standardized designs and reusable design documents should be vigorously promoted to save design manpower. Some minor projects that cannot be designed due to lack of strength can be considered for reduction.
    Third, mobilize all design personnel to do a good job in survey and design planning. If the leading comrades of a design department attach importance to survey and design planning and personally lead this work, the plan of this department can be done well. But in addition to the importance of the leading comrades, it is also necessary to mobilize all design personnel to pay attention to and learn this work, especially the leading comrades of the design department, the heads of each section, and the person in charge of design, must first learn the planning methods and combine the characteristics and specific circumstances of their own unit's profession to study a specific plan implementation measures and steps. Then, on this basis, mobilize design personnel to learn the planning methods. At the beginning of planning, the leadership should also pay attention to piloting first in order to gain experience and promote it in an all-round way. In the process of planning, it is also necessary to overcome various erroneous ideas and establish in the minds of design personnel that the national plan is the law. If the ideological work of mobilizing and educating the masses is neglected, then the planning work cannot truly have a mass base.
    Fourth, earnestly learn from Soviet experts. The Soviet Union has extremely rich experience in compiling survey and design plans, and many design units now have Soviet experts, which is an extremely favorable condition. We must educate all design personnel to make full use of this condition, humbly ask Soviet experts for advice, and obtain the guidance of Soviet experts. At the same time, it is also necessary to study the practical experience of the Coal Mine Design Bureau and the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Company in compiling survey and design plans under the guidance of Soviet experts for the past six months in order to improve the level of plan compilation.
    Fifth, survey and design plans must proceed from reality, on the one hand, to adapt to the requirements of national construction, and on the other hand, to accurately calculate and balance their own design capabilities. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose both conservatism and prevent rashness. The former will delay the progress of construction and form a "idling" of design forces, while the latter will reduce the quality of design and produce "rush work" and "rework" phenomena. Because some design institutions have not been established for a long time, their technical level is low, and they lack design data, especially the lack of experience in compiling design plans, it is still difficult to completely avoid some design rework and temporary addition of some design tasks. Considering these conditions and factors, when compiling plans, each design unit, on the basis of giving full play to the potential strength of design personnel, can plan to prepare the necessary reserve forces in order to cope with temporary problems. In this way, the realization of the planned plan will not be disrupted, and the quality of the design can be ensured.
    Under the illumination of the general line of the country during the transition period, the people of the whole country are advancing along the road of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation with full confidence. The design personnel of the whole country should also contribute their greatest strength with doubled spirit, do a good job in survey and design work, and strive to improve the passive state of design work and ensure the completion of the country's capital construction plan.

### 适应国家建设需要，编好勘察设计计划

    适应国家建设需要，编好勘察设计计划
    加强勘察和设计工作，是进行基本建设，逐步实现国家社会主义工业化的一个重要条件。勘察设计工作的质量和进度直接影响着国民经济发展的速度。因为任何一个工厂和矿山的建设，首先必须进行勘察设计，勘察工作能不能按时完成，设计图纸能不能按时提交出来，都直接影响着施工开始的日期及其进度。只有在做好勘察设计工作的基础上，施工部门才能有计划地准备劳动力、建筑材料和进行设备订货，基本建设才能有秩序地进行。
    目前我国勘察设计的力量薄弱，勘察设计人员经验不足，质量不高，使勘察设计工作和国家建设的要求发生了很大的矛盾。加以我们在勘察设计工作的领导上还存在若干缺点，不少勘察设计机构尚未很好地组织起来，仅有的勘察设计力量也还远没有发挥其应有的作用，以致有些设计部门一方面感觉设计力量不足，另一方面却较普遍地存在着“窝工”现象。这种情况必须改变。根据一九五三年各勘察设计部门实践的经验证明：要改变这种情况，首要的任务就是组织所有的国家设计部门立即开始编制勘察设计计划，把勘察设计工作纳入计划的轨道，按照计划来管理勘察设计工作，平衡设计力量，组织现有的设计部门均衡地进行工作。只有这样，才能克服勘察设计工作的盲目性，使勘察设计的工作人员明确奋斗的目标，提高工作效率和质量，保证任务按时完成。例如煤矿设计局，由于制订了勘察设计计划，设计工作量在短时间内就有了显著的提高。一九五三年十月份一个月的工作量，就等于一至十月份十个月全部工作量的百分之三十二点一。
    目前许多设计部门要把勘察设计计划编好，是存在一些困难的。这些困难主要是：有些设计部门只有上半年的设计任务，下半年的设计任务尚未确定，因此全年的设计任务不好通盘计划；有些设计部门因为地质计划变更，或不能按期提出设计矿量，或因甲方不能按时提出设计资料及保证资料的正确性，因而影响了设计工作的部署；有的设计部门因为计划任务书不能及时提出，或提出后又要变更，因而使设计进行时缺乏明确的根据并容易造成返工；许多设计部门由于缺乏编制计划的经验和没有劳动定额，因此不能准确地估计设计工作量和确定设计文件交付的日期。上述原因确实增加了编制勘察设计计划的困难，但这些困难并不能说明勘察设计计划是不能编制的。
    我们必须充分考虑到目前编制勘察设计计划是存在着许多有利条件的。这些条件主要是：由于五年计划的开始实行，国家对国民经济的计划性逐渐加强，一九五四年度基本建设计划的控制数字早已下达，这就为编制勘察设计计划创造了条件；许多设计部门的领导同志，已从自己切身的经验中，体会到勘察设计计划的重要性，都认为必须编制勘察设计计划才能克服工作中的盲目性和被动状况，这就能更好的带动全体设计人员做好勘察设计计划工作；一年来，设计人员已逐步集中，专业的设计机构相继成立，这样就可以使勘察设计计划有系统地在设计部门内部推行；许多设计部门都或多或少地积累了一些设计、估计工作量及做计划的经验，并且学习了某些先进设计机构编制勘察设计计划的方法；全国已经拟定了统一的编制勘察设计计划的表格和方法。所有这些有利的因素都说明：目前编制勘察设计计划的基本条件是具备的。
    为了把勘察设计计划编好，应该注意以下几个问题：
    第一，树立整体观念，发扬配合协作的精神。勘察设计项目及其进度必须与基本建设计划密切衔接，施工图纸提交的进度必须与施工进度密切结合，地质资料提交的进度必须与设计进度密切结合。各个设计部门之间与设计部门内部各单位之间的计划，也必须密切配合。为此，各单位在确定勘察设计项目及其计划时，设计部门、计划部门、地质部门、基本建设部门及各单位相互之间，都必须从整体出发，配合协作，互相帮助，主动联系，共同研究与确定设计项目及设计计划，充分地考虑到需要与可能，并且求得一致。那种只顾自己不顾别人的孤立观点和分散主义现象必须反对。
    第二，保证重点工程的设计任务按计划完成。目前许多设计部门的设计任务十分繁重，普遍地感到人力不足。因此各个设计部门一方面必须充分发挥设计人员的积极性，挖掘设计部门的潜在力量；另一方面，订计划时又必须根据任务的轻重缓急、主要次要，分别排队，集中一切力量保证重点工程按时完成或提前完成；次要的设计项目，应简化设计程序，并大力推广定型设计及可重复利用的设计文件，以节省设计力量。有些没有力量进行设计的次要项目，可以考虑削减。
    第三，动员全体设计人员做好勘察设计计划。如果一个设计部门的领导同志重视勘察设计计划，并亲自去领导这项工作，这个部门的计划是能够做好的。但是除了领导同志的重视外，还必须动员全体设计人员重视和学习这项工作，特别是设计部门的领导同志、各科的负责人和设计总负责人，必须首先学会计划的编制办法，并结合本单位的专业的特点和具体情况，研究出一个具体执行计划的措施和步骤。然后在这个基础上动员设计人员学习计划的编制办法。在编制计划之初，领导上还应注意先行试点，以便取得经验，全面推广。在编制计划的过程中，还必须克服各种错误的思想，并在设计人员中树立国家计划就是法律的观点。如果忽视动员与教育群众的思想工作，那就不能使计划工作真正具有群众基础。
    第四，认真地向苏联专家学习。苏联对编制勘察设计计划具有极丰富的经验，现在很多设计单位有苏联专家，这是一个极为有利的条件。我们必须教育全体设计人员，充分运用这一条件，虚心地向苏联专家请教，取得苏联专家的指导。同时还需研究煤矿设计局和鞍钢设计公司在苏联专家指导下，半年来编制勘察设计计划的实际经验，以提高编制计划的水平。
    第五，勘察设计计划必须从实际出发，一方面要适应国家建设的要求，另一方面又要精确计算和平衡自己的设计能力。因此，既要反对保守，又要防止冒进。前者会延缓建设的进度，形成设计力量的“窝工”，后者会降低设计的质量，产生“赶工”“返工”现象。由于有些设计机构成立不久，技术水平较低，设计资料缺乏，特别是没有编制设计计划的经验，某些设计的部分返工和临时追加一些设计任务的现象，还很难完全避免。考虑到这些条件和因素，各设计单位编制计划时，在发挥设计人员潜在力量的基础上，可以有计划地准备必要的预备力量，以应付临时发生的问题。这样，就不致于打乱预定计划的实现，并可确保设计的质量。
    全国人民在国家过渡时期总路线的照耀下，正满怀信心地沿着社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的道路前进。全国的设计人员也应该精神百倍地贡献出最大的力量，做好勘察设计工作，为改善设计工作的被动状态，保证完成国家的基本建设计划而奋斗。
