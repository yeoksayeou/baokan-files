Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in East China Vigorously Organize Local Goods
    Shuangliao County Cooperative in Liaoxi Province Prepares Spring Plowing Tools in Advance
    To meet the needs of farmers expanding spring plowing production after selling surplus grain and cotton, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of East China are vigorously organizing local goods.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in Huimin and Liaocheng Special Districts of Shandong Province have held meetings of handicraft industry representatives to organize handicraft workers to manufacture various agricultural tools needed by farmers for spring plowing. The cooperatives of Gaotang, Yanggu, Guanxian, and Guanchao counties alone signed 141 contracts with handicraft industry representatives, involving 61 kinds of products. The Suzhou Special District Cooperative in Jiangsu Province held an internal material exchange meeting in November last year, focusing on handicrafts and agricultural and sideline products, and signed a total of 318 contracts with a transaction value of 16.4 billion yuan. Local goods managed by the Anqing Special District Cooperative in Anhui Province originally accounted for 20 percent of the total goods, but now that has been expanded to 49 percent. The Zhanggang Grassroots Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Changle County, Fujian Province, recently purchased 500 bundles of bamboo to supply local bamboo industry groups for processing and manufacturing agricultural tools, and sent cadres to Minhou, Fuqing, Yongtai and other places to purchase vegetable cakes and other means of production in preparation for supply during spring plowing.
    In addition: The Shuangliao County Cooperative Union in Liaoxi Province is preparing spring plowing tools in advance, striving to meet the requirements of farmers to expand production as much as possible.
    In the past, the cooperative only started preparing the means of production in the spring. In the fourth quarter of 1953, the cooperative analyzed the characteristics of the local rural harvest and the masses' large-scale sale of surplus grain, and began to organize iron production cooperatives and handicraft workers to process small agricultural tools such as large hoes and two-pronged cultivators in November. At the same time, with the assistance of the Industry and Commerce Section of the County People's Government, the production capacity of handicraft production cooperatives and the production and sales of private workshops in the county were investigated. It was found that there was a shortage of vehicles, so they organized local handicrafts for processing and production on the one hand, and purchased 100 small rubber-wheeled carts, 50 flower-wheeled carts, and 100 sets of Red Flag brand rubber tires from other places. In addition, according to the requirements of local farmers, 500 mares, 1,000 dairy cows, and 5,000 sheep were ordered from other places. By December last year, small agricultural tools such as iron shovels, two-pronged cultivators, grass sieves, and rope sets processed by local handicrafts had all been allocated to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives; the ordered small rubber-wheeled carts had also been allocated to rural areas; and the ordered dairy cows and other goods had begun to arrive; materials for making vehicles had also been successively transported. At present, farmers are very enthusiastic about buying horses and carts to prepare for expanding production. Xiao Wenzhun Agricultural Production Cooperative in the third district sold 40,000 jin of surplus grain to the state and bought back five horses in preparation for using new agricultural tools in 1954. Many farmers said: "We had a good harvest in 1953 and have surplus money after selling grain, so we have to prepare a complete set of tools for farming."

    华东各地供销合作社大力组织地方货源
    辽西省双辽县合作社提前准备春耕农具
    华东区各地供销合作社为适应农民出售余粮、棉花后扩大春耕生产的需要，正大力组织地方货源。
    山东省惠民专区合作社和聊城专区各县合作社都召开了手工业代表会议，组织手工业者为农民制造春耕需要的各种农具，仅高唐、阳谷、冠县、观朝四个县的合作社即和手工业代表签订了一百四十一件合同，产品达六十一种。江苏省苏州专区合作社，在去年十一月间举行了以手工业品和农副产品为主的内部物资交流会，共签订了三百一十八件合同，交易总额达一百六十四亿元。安徽省安庆专区合作社经营的地方货源，原来占全部货源的百分之二十，现在扩大到占百分之四十九。福建省长乐县漳港基层供销合作社日前采购了五百捆竹子，供应当地竹业小组加工制造农具，并派干部到闽侯、福清、永泰等地采购菜饼等生产资料，准备春耕时供应。
    又讯：辽西省双辽县合作社联合社提前准备春耕农具，争取尽量满足农民扩大生产的要求。
    该社过去准备生产资料都是在春天才开始。一九五三年第四季度，该社分析了当地农村丰收和群众大量出卖余粮的特点，在十一月份就着手组织铁业生产合作社和手工业者加工大镐、二齿子等小农具。同时取得县人民政府工商科的协助，对全县手工业生产合作社的生产能力和私营车铺的产、销等情况做了调查。发现当地车辆有供不应求的现象，便一面组织当地手工业加工生产，一面从外地采购了小型胶轮车一百台、花轮车五十台和红旗牌胶轮胎一百套。另外，根据当地农民的要求，向外地订购了五百匹骒马、一千头乳牛和五千只羊。到去年十二月，通过当地手工业加工的铁锹、二齿子、草筛子、绳套等小农具，已全部拨到基层供销合作社；订购的小胶轮车也拨到了农村；订购的乳牛等已开始进货；制作车辆用的材料也已陆续运到。目前，农民买马、买车，准备扩大生产的劲头很足。第三区萧文俊农业生产合作社卖给国家四万斤余粮，买回五匹马，准备一九五四年使用新式农具。许多农民说：“一九五三年丰收，卖粮后有余钱，就得把种地用的这套家什准备齐全了。”
