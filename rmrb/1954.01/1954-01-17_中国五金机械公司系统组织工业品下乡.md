The China National Hardware and Machinery Company system, closely combined with department stores, cooperatives, and other units, has organized the supply of hardware and machinery to rural areas, meeting the needs of the broad masses of farmers and small-town handicraftsmen. The quantity of hardware and machinery supplied to rural areas in the third and fourth quarters of last year increased significantly compared to the first and second quarters. By the end of November in the fourth quarter, the total value of goods supplied to rural areas had increased by 109.25% compared to the first quarter.

In expanding the supply of civilian hardware and machinery to rural areas, the China National Hardware and Machinery Company system dispatched specialized personnel to conduct investigations, helped local department stores, cooperatives, and other units understand the needs of surrounding rural areas and small towns, and introduced business knowledge such as commodity names, specifications, and uses, thereby strengthening the supply and sales relationship with department stores, cooperatives, and other units. For example, the Tonghua City Company of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company increased the total value of goods supplied to rural areas in the third quarter of 1953 by more than 50% compared to the second quarter through department stores, cooperatives, and other units. The Qiqihar Branch of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company established supply and sales relationships with 95 county department stores and county/city cooperatives in 1953, and also established supply relationships with more than 100 handicraftsmen. Currently, 1,430 village cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province are operating with commodities such as iron nails and iron wire. In December of last year, the Qiqihar Branch of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company, in coordination with the state's grain purchase, further met the needs of farmers and handicraftsmen in Suihua, Baicheng, Beian, and other places. It invited local department stores and other units to hold a civilian hardware ordering meeting. Based on the requirements raised by all parties at the meeting, it allocated 8.5 billion yuan worth of 331 kinds of commodities, including new-style chaff cutters, large rakes, hoes, shovels, iron ropes, and round nails for agricultural and sideline production tools; civilian equipment such as chimneys, door locks, and handles; and raw materials needed for handicrafts such as round iron for shoeing horses and flat iron for making sickles.

The main obstacle to expanding the supply of civilian hardware and machinery to rural areas is that some units still do not fully recognize the political and economic significance of expanding the supply of hardware and machinery to rural areas, underestimate rural purchasing power, and believe that sales in rural areas are not large. Therefore, they lack systematic investigation and research into rural needs and requirements. These problems should be resolved in a timely manner.

    中国五金机械公司系统组织工业品下乡
    中国五金机械公司系统和百货公司、合作社等单位密切结合，组织五金器材下乡，供应了广大农民和小城镇手工业者的需要。去年第三、四季度五金器材下乡的数量比一、二季度有显著提高。第四季度截至十一月止，供应下乡的商品总值比第一季度增加了百分之一百零九点二五。
    中国五金机械公司系统在扩大民用器材下乡供应中，曾先后派遣了专门人员进行调查，并帮助各地百货公司、合作社等单位，了解周围农村及小城镇需要情况，介绍商品名称、规格、用途等业务知识，密切了和百货公司、合作社等单位的供销关系。如中国五金机械公司通化市公司一九五三年第三季度通过百货公司、合作社等单位供应下乡商品总值比第二季度增加了百分之五十以上。中国五金机械公司齐齐哈尔分公司一九五三年度中和九十五个县百货公司，县、市合作社建立了供销关系，还和一百多家手工业者建立了供应关系。目前黑龙江省内已有一千四百三十个村合作社经营了铁钉、铁丝等商品。中国五金机械公司齐齐哈尔分公司在去年十二月份配合国家购粮，进一步满足绥化、白城、北安等地农民和手工业者需要，曾邀请当地百货公司等单位召开了一次民用五金订货会议，根据会上各方面所提的要求，下拨了价值八十五亿元的三百三十一种商品，其中有农副业生产工具新式铡花机、大爬条、镐、锹、铁绳、元钉等；有民用器材如烟囱、门锁、拉手等；有手工业所需原料打马掌用的元铁、打镰刀用的扁铁等。
    目前扩大民用五金器材下乡中的主要障碍是某些单位对扩大五金器材下乡的政治意义和经济意义还认识不足，对农村购买力估计不足，认为农村销售量不大，因而对农村需要情况和要求缺乏系统的调查研究，这些问题都应该及时解决。
