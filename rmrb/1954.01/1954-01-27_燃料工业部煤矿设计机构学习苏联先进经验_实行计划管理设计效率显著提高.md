Ministry of Fuel Industry Coal Mine Design Institutions Learn from Soviet Advanced Experience
Implement Planned Management and Significantly Improve Design Efficiency

The coal mine design institutions of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry have been learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implementing planned management, which has significantly improved design efficiency, and the situation where design lags behind construction has gradually improved.

Among the coal mine design institutions of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Northeast Design Bureau was established in 1951 and has some foundation. Other design bureaus, such as the General Bureau Design Bureau and the East China Design Bureau, were established successively at the end of 1952 and the beginning of 1953. Design personnel were drawn from factories and mines in various regions. A large number of new university and junior college graduates were assigned, most of whom had no design experience and low technical skills. At the same time, technical leadership was weak, and management personnel did not know what work should be done each month or every ten days, resulting in serious idleness. The work tasks could not be completed for several months in a row. The leadership did not understand whether the problem was technical or organizational.

Later, after Soviet design expert Comrade Ye Meilin arrived, he pointed out that the fundamental reason for the chaotic state of design work and the failure to complete national tasks was the failure to implement planned management. He helped to formulate plan forms, provided methods for planned management, and solved many specific problems. After several months of exploration, the design plan management work gradually got on the right track. The situation in each design bureau has improved to varying degrees. Design personnel began to establish a comprehensive view of completing tasks, initially mastered the workload required for a design and the proportion of each department, improved the organizational structure, and established a complete set of plan management reports, etc., thereby significantly improving design efficiency. For example, in 1953, the General Bureau Design Bureau only completed 4.3 percent of the annual task in the first quarter. After planned management was implemented in May, the situation gradually improved, and the workload in the third quarter was equivalent to 217 percent of the first half of the year, and the workload in the fourth quarter was equivalent to 160 percent of the third quarter. The workload of the Northeast Design Bureau in the fourth quarter was equivalent to 180 percent of the third quarter.

According to the bureau's experience, to do a good job in plan management, it is first necessary to overcome ideological obstacles. In the early stage of the bureau's implementation of plan management, some people had ideological resistance. For example, some people believed that design is a mental task, not like construction on the construction site, which can be carried out according to plan; others believed that the time spent filling out plan forms was better spent drawing two more drawings, and therefore adopted a perfunctory attitude. The bureau's leadership, in response to these ideological situations, conducted criticism, and repeatedly educated and mobilized people with domestic facts and Soviet experience, finally making everyone understand the importance of plan management work.

Secondly, it is also necessary to establish a comprehensive view of completing tasks among design personnel. The General Bureau Design Bureau and the Northeast Design Bureau have combined the anti-bureaucracy and increase production and conservation movement, and checked the reasons for the failure to complete tasks by calculating detailed accounts and summarizing work, and carried out criticism and commendation, thus enabling design personnel to gradually establish a comprehensive view of completing tasks, and greatly improving their enthusiasm. The chief engineer can be conscientious and responsible. When geological data cannot be submitted in time, the design personnel do not take a waiting attitude, but actively help the geological department to submit the data in time.

Thirdly, it is necessary to deeply mobilize the masses and organize the masses. The Northeast Design Bureau overcame the difficulties in preparing and reviewing the budget by mobilizing and organizing the masses, so the workload estimate was more accurate, reducing omissions and idleness. The team leader grasps the team's budget and work progress table, organizes mutual assistance groups, and supervises and inspects each other. Full-time planners go deep into the masses to understand the situation, report in time, and solve problems. In this way, plan management has a mass base, which guarantees the completion of national tasks.

Fourthly, it is necessary to improve the organizational system. The General Bureau Design Bureau completed the national task for the first time last September, and the appropriate adjustment of the organizational system is also one of the main reasons. Their method is: each department divides the work according to the work task, increasing from the original fourteen departments and four offices to eighteen departments and eight offices, and each department is grouped according to the task, and each person has a clear specialty, changing the past practice of grouping according to specialty, simplifying the complex relationship between each other and making the contact closer.

Fifthly, it is necessary to establish a complete management system. The bureau first established a set of reports from individuals to the entire design institution. Such as personal work hour record table, work hour record card, labor daily report, progress chart for departments and groups, and reports mastered by the planning department. In addition, inspection and reward and punishment systems were also established.

Last December, the bureau convened a design plan conference, where various design institutions exchanged experiences in preparing design plans and plan management, and promoted the plan forms issued by the State Planning Commission. Everyone expressed full confidence in further consolidating and improving plan management work in the future, carrying out balanced and rhythmic production according to national requirements, gradually improving product quality, submitting design documents on schedule, and ensuring the smooth construction of basic construction.

　　燃料工业部煤矿设计机构学习苏联先进经验
　　实行计划管理设计效率显著提高
    中央燃料工业部煤矿设计机构学习苏联先进经验，实行了计划管理，设计效率显著提高，设计赶不上施工的状况已逐渐好转。
    中央燃料工业部煤矿设计机构中，除东北设计局是在一九五一年成立略有基础外，其他如总局设计局，华东设计局等，均在一九五二年底与一九五三年初先后成立。设计人员除由各地区厂矿抽调外，新分配的大学与专科学校毕业生数量较多，都没有设计经验，技术水平很低，同时技术领导薄弱，管理人员不知道每月每旬应做哪些工作，窝工现象很严重，工作任务连续几个月完不成。究竟毛病在哪里，是技术问题，还是组织问题，领导方面也弄不清楚。
    后来，苏联设计专家叶美林同志来到后，指出造成设计工作的盲目混乱状态和不能完成国家任务的基本原因，在于未实行计划管理，并且帮助拟定了计划表格，提供了计划管理的办法，解决了很多具体问题。经过几个月的摸索，设计计划管理工作逐渐纳入正轨，各设计局的情况在不同程度上得到了改善，设计人员开始树立了全面完成任务的观点，初步掌握了进行一个设计所需的工作量及各科所占比重，改善了组织机构，建立了一套完整的计划管理表报等，因而设计效率显著提高。例如一九五三年总局设计局第一季度只完成全年任务的百分之四点三，五月开始实行计划管理后，情况逐渐好转，第三季度的工作量相当于上半年的百分之二百十七，第四季度的工作量又相当于第三季度的百分之一百六十。东北设计局第四季度的工作量相当于第三季度的百分之一百八十。
    根据该局的经验，要做好计划管理工作，首先必须克服思想障碍。该局实行计划管理的初期，部分人员思想上是有抵触的。例如有的人认为设计是动脑筋的事，不比工地施工，可按计划进行；有的人认为填计划表格的时间，不如多画两张图，因而采取了应付态度。该局领导上针对这些思想情况，进行批判，以国内的事实和苏联的经验反复教育动员，终于使大家了解了计划管理工作的重要。
    其次，还必须在设计人员中树立全面完成任务的观点。总局设计局及东北设计局都曾经结合反官僚主义和增产节约运动，通过算细账、总结工作等方式，检查任务完不成的原因，并进行批评与表扬，因而使设计人员逐渐树立了全面完成任务的观点，积极性大为提高，主任工程师能做到认真负责。地质资料不能及时提出时，设计人员不是采取等待的态度，而是主动地帮助地质部门及时提出资料。
    第三，必须深入发动群众，组织群众。东北设计局由于发动及组织群众克服了编制及审核预算的难关，因而工作量估计较准确，减少了遗漏项目及窝工等现象。组长掌握组的预算表及工作进度表，组织互助小组，互相督促检查。专职计划员深入群众了解情况，及时汇报，解决问题。这样，计划管理有了群众基础，就保证了国家任务的完成。
    第四，必须改善组织系统。总局设计局去年九月份第一次完成了国家任务，组织系统的适当调整亦是主要原因之一。他们的办法是：每科按工作任务分工，由原来十四科四室增加到十八科八室，科以下按任务分组，每个人有明确的专业，改变过去按专业分组的做法，使互相间的复杂关系简化了，联系紧密了。
    第五，必须建立完整的管理制度。该局首先建立了一套自个人到整个设计机构的表报。如个人工时记录表、工时记录卡片、劳动工日报表、科组进度指示图表以及计划科掌握的表报等。此外还建立了检查和奖惩等制度。
    去年十二月，该局召开了设计计划会议，各设计机构交流了编制设计计划与计划管理的经验，推行了国家计划委员会颁发的计划表格，大家都表示有充分信心能够在今后进一步巩固与改善计划管理工作，根据国家要求，进行均衡的，有节奏的生产，逐步提高产品质量，按期提出设计文件，保证基本建设顺利施工。
