    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
    Introduction to the Chinese Edition, 1954, Issue 2

    The Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 2, 1954, has been published.

    This issue features an editorial entitled "The Correct Path to Further Easing International Tensions." The editorial points out: The reply given by Comrade G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to questions raised by Kingsbury Smith on January 1st is a document of profound international significance and another great contribution by the Soviet Union to the cause of strengthening peace and the security of all peoples. This reply provides a very profound assessment of the current international situation and points out ways to further ease international tensions. It has attracted the attention of the world public. Certain American newspapers, reflecting the positions of the most reactionary aggressive blocs, in order to dilute the profound impression Malenkov's reply has made on the broad masses of the American people, have attempted to divert public attention from the specific proposals of the Soviet Union and engage in despicable slander against the Soviet Union's peace policy. However, the truth cannot be concealed! The truth of the Soviet Union's peace policy breaks through all the obstacles erected by the enemies of peace, inspires all people of goodwill, and gives new strength to the fighters for peace. The vast army of peace advocates is intensifying its struggle to consolidate peace, and the peace-loving people of all countries will do their utmost to realize their sacred aspiration—to further ease international tensions and further consolidate world peace.

    Important articles published in this issue include "Tasks for Raising Hungarian Agricultural Production" by Árpád Házi, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party; "Factory Newspapers in Brazil" by Maurício Grabois, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party; and "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" by M. Mitin.

    In his article, Házi outlines the important measures recently decided upon by the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Council of Ministers of the Republic regarding the development of agriculture. The article points out: The most important task of Hungarian agriculture at present is to ensure the uninterrupted supply of sufficient bread to the residents and to ensure the supply of raw materials needed by the food industry. The only appropriate solution to the problem is to increase the yield per unit area. Another important task of agriculture is to produce more potatoes and vegetables to ensure an uninterrupted and adequate supply of this food to the residents. In addition, close attention must be paid to the development of animal husbandry. Házi emphasizes that all measures for the further development of agriculture are aimed at increasing agricultural productivity. These measures require an increase in the labor force. The only way to solve the labor force problem is to rapidly implement mechanization. At the same time, in order to better utilize agricultural machinery and improve the quality of machine cultivation, the work of training tractor drivers must first be improved and the number of agricultural technical cadres increased.

    Grabois's article points out: Factory newspapers play an important role in the political education and organization of the Brazilian working class. In factories, the class struggle takes a particularly open and sharp form. There, the class consciousness of the workers increases day by day, and factory newspapers reflect this life situation of the workers. Factory newspapers make a great contribution to the workers' struggle to improve their lives. In addition to playing the role of collective agitators, factory newspapers also play the role of collective organizers. Factory newspapers do not limit their work to the struggle to realize the economic and social demands of the working class; they also pay great attention to the struggle for peace. The increase in the number of factory newspapers and their growing influence will promote the struggle of Brazilian workers, raise their revolutionary consciousness, and make them more strongly organized.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版一九五四年第二期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第二期已经出版。
    本期以“进一步缓和国际紧张局势的正确道路”为题发表社论。社论指出：一月一日发表的苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫同志对金·史密斯所提问题的答复，是一个具有深刻的国际意义的文件，是苏联对于加强和平与各国人民安全事业的又一巨大贡献。这一答复对目前的国际局势作了非常深刻的估计，并指出了进一步缓和国际紧张局势的办法。它已引起了全世界公众的注意。某些反映最反动的侵略集团的立场的美国报纸，为了冲淡马林科夫的答复在广大美国人民中所造成的深刻印象，便企图使公众的注意力从苏联的具体建议上转移开去，并对苏联的和平政策进行卑鄙的诽谤。但是，事实的真相是掩盖不了的！苏联的和平政策的真相突破了和平的敌人所树立的一切障碍，鼓舞着所有具有善良意志的人们，并给予和平战士们以新的力量。和平拥护者大军正在加紧为巩固和平而斗争，各国爱好和平的人民一定会竭尽全力来实现自己的神圣愿望——进一步缓和国际紧张局势，进一步巩固世界和平。
    本期刊载的重要文章有匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会政治局委员安·赫格居斯的“提高匈牙利农业生产的任务”，巴西共产党中央委员会书记毛·格拉波伊斯的“巴西的工厂报纸”，麦·米丁的“毛泽东选集”。
    赫格居斯在文章中概述了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会和共和国部长会议最近决定的关于发展农业的重要措施。文章指出：匈牙利农业当前最重要的任务就是保证不间断地供给居民以充足的面包，保证供给食品工业所需的原料。而唯一合适的解决问题的办法就是提高单位面积产量。农业的另一个重要的任务就是生产更多的马铃薯和蔬菜，以保证不间断地、充分地把这种食物供应给居民。此外还必须密切注意饲畜业的发展。赫格居斯着重说：进一步发展农业的一切措施，都是为了提高农业的生产力。这些措施要求着增加劳动力。而解决劳动力问题的唯一办法就是迅速实行机械化。同时，为了更好地利用农业机器和提高机器耕作的质量，首先就要改进培养拖拉机手的工作，增加农业技术干部。
    格拉波伊斯的文章指出：工厂报纸对巴西工人阶级起着重要的政治教育作用和组织作用。在工厂里，阶级斗争采取着特别公开和尖锐的形式，在那里，工人的阶级觉悟一天比一天提高，工厂报纸就反映着工人们的这种生活情况。工厂报纸对工人们争取改善生活的斗争有很大的贡献。工厂报纸除了起集体鼓动者的作用外，还起着集体组织者的作用。工厂报纸并不把自己的工作局限于争取实现工人阶级的经济和社会要求的斗争，它们还非常注意争取和平的斗争。工厂报纸数目的增加和它们日益扩大的影响，将促进巴西工人的斗争，提高工人的革命觉悟，并使他们更加坚强地组织起来。
