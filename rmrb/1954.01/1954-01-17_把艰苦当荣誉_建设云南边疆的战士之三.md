Taking Hardship as Honor
— Three Soldiers Building the Yunnan Border
Guo Guofu

This is a winter morning. A squad stationed on the Yunnan border received a logging mission and headed into the high mountains and dense forests. Here, the sky appears only as tiny specks of greyish-white stars, and the branches and leaves separate people from the sunlight; here, it is always foggy, and the clothes worn outside are constantly soaked as if immersed in water; here, the fallen leaves pile up several feet thick, and when you step on them, water seeps out, and shoes and socks are covered in mud year after year.

Wang Guoyan is a twenty-three-year-old young soldier, and like all the comrades in the squad, he endures this hardship; he also, like everyone else, regards hardship as an honor. In the coldest times, he does not think of fire; in the thirstiest times, he does not think of water. What he thinks of first is the achievements of labor, the future of the border region, factories smoking, cars running on the highways, and children playing in the Youth Palace.

At the beginning, Wang Guoyan's right instep was cut by an axe, and when mud and water seeped in, the wound swelled up. The instructor said, "Wang Guoyan, you stay and rest today." Wang Guoyan said, "It's okay, I can go." The instructor raised his voice and said, "You have to listen!" Wang Guoyan rested for a day. That day, he felt particularly long, and the sound of chopping trees, one after another, made him even more restless. The next day, he requested, "Instructor, my foot is much better, let me go today!" He repeated this three times in a row, but the instructor did not agree. On the third day, he couldn't bear it any longer. He cut off one side of his shoe upper, put this specially made broken shoe on his foot, and showed it to the instructor: "Instructor, look, isn't this fine?" At his earnest request, the instructor agreed. He limped, moving step by step from this tree to that tree.

One day, he chopped down fifty trees as big as a hug, but he shook his head: too few.

He chopped down sixty trees, but he still shook his head: too few.

One stormy night, in the forest, the sound of thunder echoed one after another, and the branches were shaken by the wind and rain, making deafening roars. Wang Guoyan, draped in an oilcloth, stood under a large tree, holding a gun in his hand, standing guard! The wind blew him, the rain hit him, and the dazzling lightning flashed through the forest. The things in front of him jumped up and sank down again in the blue lightning. This was the coldest and most terrifying night in the forest. But young Wang Guoyan's heart was fiery and calm. While vigilantly watching the surrounding movements, he was thinking: What method can I use to make the trees fall faster? After experiencing many such nights, he finally came up with a method.

He chose the trees to be cut on a line, in one direction, the first, second, and third trees, cutting only seven-tenths of the way through, and then felled the fourth tree; when the fourth tree "crashed" down, it fell on the third tree, and the third tree followed suit, and the second and first trees also fell. From that day on, Wang Guoyan was able to fell one hundred and nine trees every day.

Every time, when Wang Guoyan watched hundreds of ox carts, carrying the cut-to-size lumber, heading along the rugged mountain road to the places where construction was needed, an uncontrollable smile appeared on his face, as if saying: "This is so good!"

    把艰苦当荣誉
    ——建设云南边疆的战士之三
    郭国甫
    这是冬天的早晨，驻在云南边疆的一个班，接受了伐木任务，走向高山密林去了。这里，看到的天空，只是灰白星星一样的细点点，枝叶把人和阳光隔开了；这里，任何时候都是雾沉沉的，穿在外面的衣服，经常是跟水浸了一样；这里，落叶堆起有几尺厚，踏上去，向外渗着水，鞋袜长年累月是泥浆水渍的。
    王国燕是个二十三岁的青年战士，他和班里所有的同志一样，经受着这种艰苦；也和大家一样，把艰苦当作荣誉。在最冷的时候，他想到的不是火；在最渴的时候，他想到的不是水。他最先想到的是劳动的成绩，是边疆的未来，工厂在冒烟，汽车在公路上奔跑，儿童们在少年宫玩耍。
    一开始，王国燕的右脚背就被斧头划破了，泥水一浸，伤口便肿起来。指导员说：“王国燕，今天你留下休息。”王国燕说：“不要紧，我能去。”指导员提高嗓音说：“你要听话呵！”王国燕歇了一天。这天，他觉得特别长，一声赶一声的砍树声，使他越发不能平静。第二天，他要求说：“指导员，我的脚好多了，今天让我去吧！”他一连重复了三遍，指导员没答应他。第三天，他再也耐不住了。他剪去一边鞋帮，把这只特做的破鞋，套在脚上，伸给指导员看：“指导员，你看，这不是好好的吗？”在他的恳请下，指导员答应了他。他颠着脚，一步步从这棵树移向那棵树。
    一天，一抱大的树，他砍倒五十棵，但他摇摇头：太少了。
    砍倒六十棵了，他还是摇摇头：太少了。
    一个大风大雨的夜晚，森林里，不断的响着一个连一个的霹雷声，树枝受着风雨的吹打，摇撼着，发出震耳的呼啸。王国燕披着一块油布，站在一棵大树下，他手里持着枪，正在放哨！风吹他，雨打他，晃眼的电光，从森林中透过来，他眼前的东西，在蓝色的闪电里跳起来，又沉下去。这是森林里最寒冷、最恐怖的夜晚。但年青的王国燕，心里却是火热的、镇静的。他一面警惕地注视着周围的动静，一面心里在盘算着：用什么方法，叫树倒的更快呢？经历过许多个这样的夜晚，终于，他想出一个办法来了。
    他把要砍的树，选在一条线上，朝一个方向，第一棵、第二棵、第三棵，只砍七成深，把第四棵砍倒；第四棵“哗啦”一倒，倒在第三棵身上，第三棵跟着也就倒了，第二棵、第一棵也跟着倒了。从这天以后，王国燕每天能砍倒一百零九棵了。
    每次，王国燕望着成百辆的牛车，拉着裁好了的大小木料，沿着崎岖的山路，奔向建设需要的地方时，他的脸上就出现了无法抑制的微笑，仿佛在说：“这多好啊！”（附图片）
