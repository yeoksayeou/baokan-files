Farmers in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province have achieved considerable success in grain procurement. As of January 4th, the eastern region of Inner Mongolia had completed 61.09% of the state's grain purchase plan, and Suiyuan Province had completed 56.55% of its plan.

After selling surplus grain, the vast number of farmers are actively purchasing vehicles and horses to expand production. Farmers in Huangyangmutou Township, Linhe County, Suiyuan Province, delivered all 400,000 jin of surplus grain to the state granary within four days. Following this, they ordered production tools such as carts, cattle, and horses worth over 10 million yuan from supply and marketing cooperatives and deposited a large amount of production capital in the state bank. Farmers in twenty-two townships in Jining County have already bought back over 400 cattle and 198 carts after selling grain. The advanced agricultural production cooperative in Butha Banner, Inner Mongolia, sold 132,000 jin of surplus grain and purchased many production tools. After selling grain, the Shiguan Suo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuchuan County, Suiyuan Province, added five horses and one cart; the remaining 8 million yuan was all deposited in the state bank, ready to be used to expand production during the spring plowing season.

　　内蒙古和绥远农民卖粮后
　　添车买马扩大生产
    内蒙古自治区和绥远省收购粮食工作已有不小的成绩。截至一月四日止，内蒙古东部区已完成国家购粮计划百分之六十一点零九，绥远省完成计划百分之五十六点五五。
    广大农民卖出余粮后，积极添车、买马，扩大生产。绥远省临河县黄杨木头乡的农民，四天内把四十万斤余粮全部送入国家粮库后，向供销合作社订购了价值一千余万元的大车、牛、马等生产工具，并向国家银行储蓄了大批生产资金。集宁县二十二个乡的农民，卖粮后已买回四百余头牛，一百九十八辆大车。内蒙古布特哈旗先进农业生产合作社卖出余粮十三万二千斤，购置了许多生产用具。绥远省武川县石官锁农业生产合作社卖粮后，添置了五匹马，一辆大车；其余的八百多万元全部储存在国家银行里，准备春耕时用来扩大生产。
