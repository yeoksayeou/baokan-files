After Visiting the Yubei Textile Factory, Farmers in Guowangdu Village, Anyang County, Henan Province, Resolve to Improve Agricultural Production to Support National Industrial Construction

After visiting the Yubei Textile Factory and witnessing the creative labor of the working class, farmers in Guowangdu Village, Anyang County, Henan Province, resolved to improve agricultural production and support national industrial construction.

Over 110 farmer representatives from Guowangdu Village visited the Yubei Textile Factory before the new year. During the visit, the factory workers warmly welcomed the farmer representatives, guided them through various workshops, and provided detailed explanations. Afterward, they exchanged information about their respective production situations. Many workers first expressed their gratitude to the farmer brothers for their support in providing industrial raw materials and grain. Then, the factory's trade union staff introduced the factory's production situation: the Yubei Textile Factory had only 12,000 spindles in 1950, but now it has increased to 34,000. The technical level of workers tending the spindles has improved from 200 or 400 spindles per person to 800 or even 1,000. In 1953 alone, all the workers increased production and saved 24 billion yuan for the country. Wang Yizhen, the Party Branch Secretary of the fine yarn workshop, introduced the production achievements of Xu Xingdi, a female fine yarn worker: she can watch 900 spindles and produce 383 pounds of yarn in eight hours, producing more than 119,000 pounds of yarn per year. She has to tie 1,800 ends every day and make rounds to clean around two and a half machines, walking about fifteen li. After listening to these introductions, many farmers criticized some of their past incorrect views about the worker brothers. Farmer Guo Zhenyu said, "In the past, I saw that the worker brothers wore and ate better than the farmers, and I couldn't understand it. Today, I realize how much the worker brothers contribute to the country. Our village of 1,100 people only paid 120,000 jin of public grain this year, averaging only 100,000 yuan per person, which is far behind the worker elder brothers." He Huaixin said, "When I came to visit, I thought on the road: the workers' work is easier, not as strenuous as our farmers. Now I see that the workers are very hardworking. They keep an eye on so many machines, and their hands and feet never stop moving. They also use their brains to find shortcuts. It's really not easy!" Lu Daoping, the Party Branch Secretary of Guowangdu Village, said, "Under the leadership and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government in recent years, although our village's grain production has increased year by year, it is still far behind industrial production. After we go back, we must do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation, harvest more grain, and support national industrialization." On the spot, many farmers expressed that they would do a good job in production, support the worker brothers, and support national industrial construction. After returning to the village, they quickly sold more than 50,000 jin of grain and all the cotton they had stored to the state.

    河南省安阳县郭王度村农民参观豫北纱厂后
    决心搞好农业生产支援国家工业建设
    河南省安阳县郭王度村农民参观豫北纱厂、看到工人阶级创造性的劳动后，决心搞好农业生产，支持国家工业建设。
    郭王度村农民代表一百一十多人，在年前参观了豫北纱厂。参观时，纱厂工人对农民代表热烈欢迎，引导他们参观各个车间并作了详细解说。以后，他们又互相交谈了生产情况。很多工人首先表示感谢农民兄弟在工业原料和粮食上的支持。接着，纱厂工会工作人员介绍了纱厂的生产情况：豫北纱厂在一九五○年只有一万二千个锭子，现在已增加到三万四千个；工人看锭子的技术水平，已由每人看二百个、四百个，提高到八百个甚至一千个。全体工人仅在一九五三年中就为国家增产节约了二百四十亿元。细纱车间党支部书记王义振介绍了细纱女工许杏娣的生产成绩：她能看九百个锭子，八小时可产纱三百八十三磅，每年能产纱十一万九千多磅。她每天要接一千八百个头，并绕着两台半车作巡回清洁等工作，所走路程约有十五华里。听了这些介绍以后，很多农民批判了过去对工人兄弟一些不正确的看法。农民郭振玉说：“过去我看到工人兄弟穿的吃的要比农民好一些，老是想不通。今天才知道工人兄弟对国家的贡献多么大，俺村一千一百多人今年才缴了十二万斤公粮，每人平均只有十万元，和工人老大哥比起来，真是差得太远了。”贺怀信说：“我来参观时在路上心里还想：工人的活轻，没有俺们农民出力大，现在才看到工人很辛苦，他们眼看着那么多的机器，手脚一刻也不停留，还开动脑筋找窍门，真不容易啊！”中共郭王度村支部书记路道平说：“俺村这几年来在共产党和人民政府的领导和帮助下，粮食产量虽然年年增加，但和工业生产比起来还差得很远，我们回去以后一定搞好互助合作，多收粮食，支援国家工业化。”当场很多农民都表示要搞好生产，支持工人兄弟，支持国家工业建设。回村后，他们很快就将五万多斤粮食和所存棉花全部卖给国家。
