Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 6th: The working people of the German Democratic Republic, under the slogan of "more, better, and cheaper production" put forward by the "Wilhelm Pieck" artificial fiber factory, are extensively launching the 1954 production increase campaign – "The Year of Great Labor Creativity."

The completion and over-completion of production plans in the past three years, coupled with the Soviet government's free transfer of thirty-three enterprises to the German Democratic Republic, have greatly strengthened the Republic's industrial power. On this basis, the working people in both urban and rural areas of Democratic Germany are welcoming this campaign with great production enthusiasm.

In the Magdeburg state-owned "Ernst Thälmann" heavy machinery manufacturing factory, the No. 3 Martin furnace in the "Mao Zedong" smelting workshop smelted the first batch of sixty tons of steel on the morning of January 2nd. In the Merseburg lignite factory, the coal miners exceeded the quota by mining an extra two thousand one hundred tons of coal on New Year's Day. Workers in the boiler manufacturing workshop of the Berlin Bergmann-Borsig factory guaranteed to complete at least 130 percent of the production plan each month in the first quarter of this year. Workers in the ordinary light bulb manufacturing department of the Berlin Light Bulb Factory guaranteed to complete the production plan for the first quarter of this year by March 24th. Workers at the "Engels" rayon factory in Pirna submitted more than three thousand pledges on January 2nd, guaranteeing to improve product quality, reduce waste, and strive to increase production by one-third. Workers at the Elbe Shipyard in Boizenburg decided at the factory-wide meeting on January 4th to build one extra cargo ship this year.

All members of the "Free Land" agricultural production cooperative in Hüpstedt guaranteed to increase grain production by 20 percent and milk production by 10 percent in 1954 compared to 1953, and to ensure that meat quotas are fulfilled on a quarterly basis.

    民主德国劳动人民广泛展开今年增产运动
   【新华社柏林六日电】德意志民主共和国的劳动人民在“威廉·皮克”人造纤维工厂所提出的“更多、更好、成本更低的生产”的口号下，正在广泛展开一九五四年——“伟大的劳动创造性的一年”的增产运动。
    过去三年来生产计划的完成和超额完成，加上苏联政府无代价地把三十三个企业移交给德意志民主共和国，使共和国的工业力量大大加强了。在这一基础上，民主德国城乡劳动人民以极大的生产热情来迎接这一运动。
    在马格德堡国营“恩斯特·台尔曼”重型机器制造工厂，“毛泽东”冶炼车间第三号马丁炉在一月二日早上炼出了头一批六十吨钢。在墨兹堡褐煤工厂，采煤工人在元旦超出定额多采掘了二千一百吨煤。柏林拜尔格曼—包尔齐格工厂制造锅炉的车间的工人保证在今年第一季度，每个月至少完成生产计划的百分之一百三十。柏林灯泡厂普通灯泡制造部的工人保证在三月二十四日完成今年第一季度的生产计划。波里姆尼茨“恩格斯”人造丝工厂的工人在一月二日提出了三千余件保证，保证改进产品质量、减少废品，为提高生产量三分之一而努力。波伊森堡的易北河造船厂的工人在一月四日的全厂大会上决定，在今年内超额制造货船一艘。
    休比斯台特的“自由土地”农业生产合作社全体社员保证在一九五四年内要比一九五三年增产粮食百分之二十，增产牛奶百分之十，并保证按季完成肉类缴纳额。
