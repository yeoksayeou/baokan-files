    Thirty Years and Five Years (Part 1)
    —The Joint Public-Private Partnership of Tangshan Huaxin Textile Company Before and After
    By Our Reporter Wang Xi
        (I)
    The cooperation between the people's state-owned economy and private capital has opened up a bright future for Tangshan Huaxin Textile Company.
    Huaxin Textile Company was established in Tangshan in 1919. Until 1948, it spent thirty long years following the bumpy and obscure road of capitalism. It was born in the "golden age" of the vigorous development of Chinese national capital after the First World War, experienced the catastrophe of the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War, and by the time of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it was already in its twilight years. In 1949, the sound of cannons liberating Tianjin not only removed the shackles of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism from its neck, but more fortunately than other private capitalist enterprises, it began to embark on the road of state capitalism from that time on, gaining new life and becoming stronger and younger year by year.
    This company was founded by private capital in 1919. In 1936, the pseudo-Jidong Autonomous Government forced it to absorb Japanese capital. During the Anti-Japanese War, the factory was occupied by the enemy. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, private capital recovered the property rights and management rights, and the enemy shares were taken over by the pseudo-Hebei Provincial Government. In 1949, the People's Government confiscated bureaucratic capital and began to jointly operate with private capital.
    It is now difficult to find the traces of the old "Huaxin" from the current "Huaxin". Although the factory buildings and machines remain the same, they are exerting unprecedented effectiveness. Although most of the people remain the same, they are employees and capitalists under the new system. The director's office may still be the same, but the orders issued from there to direct production are completely different. Although the management personnel are still busy calculating accounts all day long, what they calculate every day is new content... All these changes are concentratedly reflected in the increased and developed production and scale of the factory, thus creating gratifying new situations for the country, the people, the workers, and the capitalists. Let me first use a few simple figures to compare the scale and output of the factory before and after the joint public-private partnership:
        Factory Scale: Spindles: 12,000+ in 1922, 33,000+ in 1948 (only 26,000+ actually running), 54,000 in 1953. Looms: 250 in 1928, 505 in 1948, 1,032 in 1951.
    In the thirty years of capitalism, 11,000 spindles and 250+ looms were added. In the five years of joint public-private partnership, 21,000 spindles and 500+ looms were added.
    Number of Employees: 1,916 in 1948,
    5,056 in 1953. Output (Raw Yarn, converted to 20-count yarn):
    17,400 pieces in 1948
    57,575 pieces in 1952 (Cloth, converted to people's cloth):
    233,207 bolts in 1948
    864,437 bolts in 1952.
    (Dyed various colored cloth): 49,491 bolts in 1948
    380,445 bolts in 1952.
    In the fourth year of the joint public-private partnership, the yarn output was equal to 330% of that before the joint public-private partnership, the cloth was equal to 370%, and the dyed cloth was equal to 768%.
      (II)
    Originally a desolate and decaying factory, now it is boiling with the joy of labor and life; what I am saying is not just that the factory courtyard and the yard are broadcasting cheerful songs and encouraging production achievements at any time, I am talking about the laughter from the bottom of people's hearts: pregnant female workers no longer have to endure the greatest pain to abort their fetuses in the latrine, in order to maintain their qualifications to stand next to the machine for twelve hours; "Children's Mothers" – the affectionate name the factory now gives them – push stroller with canopies into the factory every day, send their children to the nursery, and go to the workshop without any worries. Now, the young workers who ride their bicycles into the factory every day can only open their surprised eyes and listen to their predecessors narrate the disasters and insults brought to them by the old life as if they were listening to legends. Now, when the factory director or engineer walks into the workshop, they will no longer hear the strange whistle that gets louder and louder and the sound of chaotic footsteps of people rushing back to their machines from the toilet – they will see workers still excitedly studying the completion of the production plan after work outside the workshop, in the club… Someone talked to me about the two floods in the factory. The first time was in 1929, when the Douhe River rose and the flood rushed into the factory courtyard and the yard. Senior staff members still played cards at home, and the workers rode on rollers in groups of three or five and played in the water. The water washed away the yarn tubes and soaked the raw cotton in the warehouse… Twenty years later, in 1949, the Douhe River flooded again. At this time, the workers followed the military representatives and fought against the flood to rescue machines and materials. Many workers automatically ran into the factory from the suburbs overnight, without eating for two days and two nights; waist-deep water could not stop the enthusiasm of young female workers competing to carry dirt baskets...
    The transformation of workers from servile labor to master-like labor has made the labor productivity of the factory break through the level reached by capitalism in the past thirty years, and it has increased several times. This is the most fundamental opportunity for the Huaxin Textile Company to undergo a fundamental change before and after the joint public-private partnership. Taking the ability of weaving workers to look after looms as an example: in 1949, at the beginning of the joint public-private partnership, the number of spindles watched by spinning workers was 192 to 252 (roller speed of 190 revolutions per minute). In the first half of 1953, it had increased to 528-768 spindles with a roller speed of 230 revolutions per minute. In 1949, a weaving worker watched 12 automatic looms and 4 ordinary looms (176 revolutions for automatic weft-changing looms and 180 revolutions for ordinary looms). In the first half of 1953, the number of automatic looms reached 32, and the number of ordinary looms reached 6 to 8 (184 revolutions for automatic weft-changing looms and 194 revolutions for ordinary looms). That is to say, under the condition that other conditions remain unchanged, labor productivity has increased by about 200%. On average, the production of one worker now抵 equals that of two workers five years ago.
    Let me use the example of a worker to illustrate this change. Li Fenglan, a spinning worker, entered this factory at the age of eleven and has now been working for eleven years. She worked in capitalist enterprises for several years and only watched 384 spindles. After the joint public-private partnership, in 1951, the factory's Party and trade union called on and organized workers to learn the Hao Jianxiu work method. In one or two years, using the same old cars, her ability to watch spindles has gradually increased to 864 spindles. The same Li Fenglan is now completely different from before. In the old days, Li Fenglan stood next to the machine for ten hours or twelve hours a day, eating only a cold steamed bun and some pickles. Now she has a watch, bought a bicycle, and lives in a small worker dormitory building. When she first started working, "I was afraid when I entered the workshop. Standing next to the machine and facing large areas of 'flowering' (i.e., broken ends), I picked up this end and the other end broke. I was very anxious. When the foreman rushed over, he glared and opened his mouth to curse: 'Are you lazy? Go home to eat!' I was hungry, cold, and angry and anxious. Working was just about enduring the hours, enduring one day after another." At that time, skilled workers "soaked" in the toilet and those who wanted to doze did, who would be willing to teach a poor little girl their skills? However, after the joint public-private partnership, when the superior called for learning the Hao Jianxiu work method, Li Fenglan already understood who she was working for. She thought, "Hao Jianxiu is younger than me and has only been working for a few years. She can contribute so much to the country. Why can't I?" Therefore, when everyone else was watching and doubting, she was determined to learn the operating method well. Moreover, when her initial attempts were unsuccessful, she endured the ridicule of those with conservative and backward ideas, and would rather reduce the number of spindles she was watching in order to learn the work method. Finally, she won. She stood in front of her partners and was elected a national model worker in the textile industry.
    Capitalist enterprises made Li Fenglan a slave to the machine for six years. The joint public-private partnership brought her a new life, new ideas, and gave her the conditions to study and improve her skills. She controlled the machine and became a skilled worker on the production front.
    Li Fenglan is now a team leader. She often thinks, "It's good for me to watch more spindles alone, but what's the use! The production plan must be completed by everyone." She does not treat her skills like the old workers in capitalist enterprises. She performs the operating method in the workshop two or three times a month, and she also pays close attention to the production meetings after work every day. In particular, she understands the difficulties of new workers and patiently teaches them. Those apprentices who have just entered the factory recently have a very different experience from Li Fenglan in her early years. After studying weaving for half a year, they can watch 384 spindles. In terms of skills, they have completed the road that Li Fenglan took five or six years to complete in just half a year. And whether they are new workers or old workers, they all regard completing the national plan as the top priority in their lives.
    This is the reason why the labor productivity of Tangshan Huaxin Textile Company has undergone a fundamental change after the joint public-private partnership. (Attached pictures)

    三十年和五年（上）
    ——唐山华新纺织公司公私合营前后
    本报记者　汪溪
        （一）
    人民的国营经济与私人资本合作，给唐山华新纺织公司开辟了光辉的前途。
    华新纺织公司于一九一九年在唐山建厂，直到一九四八年，它沿着资本主义坎坷晦暗的道路，度过了三十年漫长的岁月。它诞生于第一次世界大战后中国民族资本蓬勃发展的“黄金时代”，经历过抗日战争时期日寇的浩劫，到了国民党反动统治时期，已经是风烛残年了。一九四九年，解放天津的炮声，不仅摘掉了帝国主义和官僚资本主义套在它脖子上的枷锁，比其他私人资本主义企业更幸运的是：它从那时起就开始踏上了国家资本主义的道路，获得了新的生命，一年比一年更茁壮更年青起来了。
    这个公司于一九一九年由私人资本创办。一九三六年伪冀东自治政府强迫它吸收了日本资本。抗日战争期间，工厂为敌寇霸占。抗日战争胜利后，私人资本恢复了产权及经营权，其中敌股由伪河北省政府接收。一九四九年，人民政府没收了官僚资本，开始与私人资本合营。
    人们已很难从现在的“华新”找到旧的“华新”的形影了。尽管厂房、机器依旧，它却发挥出前所未有的效力，尽管大部分的人依旧，但他们是新的制度下的职工和资本家了。厂长的办公室也许依然如故，但从那里发出的指挥生产的号令却完全两样了，虽然经营人员依然成天在忙着打算盘，但他们每天计算的却是新的内容了……。这一切变化，集中地反映在工厂的生产和规模提高了发展了，因而更出现了对国家、对人民、对职工、对资本家，都是可喜的新情况。让我先用几个简单的数字把公私合营前后的工厂规模和生产量作个比较：
        工厂规模：纱锭：一九二二年——一万二千多锭，一九四八年——三万三千多锭（实际运转的只有二万六千多锭），一九五三年——五万四千锭。织布机：一九二八年——二百五十台，一九四八年——五百零五台，一九五一年——一千零三十二台。
    资本主义的三十年中，增加了一万一千枚纱锭，二百五十余台布机，公私合营的五年中，增加了二万一千枚纱锭，五百余台布机。
    职工人数：一九四八年——一九一六人，
    一九五三年——五○五六人。生产量：（原纱，折二十支纱）：
    一九四八年——一七四○○件
    一九五二年——五七五七五件（布，折人民市布）：
    一九四八年——二三三、二○七匹
    一九五二年——八六四、四三七匹。
    （染各种色布）：一九四八年——四九、四九一匹
    一九五二年——三八○、四四五匹。
    公私合营的第四年，纱的产量等于公私合营前的百分之三百三十，布等于百分之三百七十，染布等于百分之七百六十八。
      （二）
    原来是一座荒凉衰朽的工厂，现在，沸腾着劳动和生活的欢乐；我说的，不只是厂院和场房随时都在放送着轻快的歌声和鼓舞人的生产成绩，我说的是从人们心眼里发出的笑声：怀孕的女工再不必忍受最大的痛楚把自己的胎儿堕在茅坑里，为保住她在机器旁站上十二小时的资格；“小孩妈”——全厂现在给她们的亲切的称呼——每天推着带篷的婴儿车走进工厂，把孩子送到托儿所，自己无牵无挂地走到车间里去。现在，每天骑着自行车进厂来的年轻工人，只有睁大着吃惊的眼睛，像听传奇一样地听他们的前辈叙述旧日的生活所带给她们的灾难和凌辱。现在，厂长或是工程师走进车间，再也听不到那种由近而远此接彼应的奇怪哨音，和应声从厕所里匆忙奔回机器旁的杂乱脚步声了——他们在车间外面，在俱乐部，随时随地都会看到工人们下班后仍然在兴奋地研究着生产计划完成的情况……。有人同我谈起了厂里两次闹水灾的情形，第一次是在一九二九年，陡河水涨，大水冲进了厂院和场房。高级职员们照旧在家里打牌，工人们三五成群骑在滚桶上划水玩。水冲走了纱管，浸透了仓库里的原棉……。二十年之后，一九四九年，陡河又泛滥成灾。这时，职工们跟在军事代表之后，向大水奋战，抢救机器和物资。许多工人自动地连夜从市郊跑进厂来，两天两夜不吃饭；没腰的深水，挡不住年轻女工们竞相抬土筐的热情……。
    工人从奴役式的劳动转到主人翁式的劳动，就使工厂的劳动生产率突破了资本主义三十年来达到的水平，而且是数倍地提高了。这是华新纺织公司公私合营前后面貌翻然改观的最根本的契机。单以看车工人看车台能力来说：细纱工在开始公私合营的一九四九年看锭数目是一九二至二五二个（每分钟罗拉转数一九○转上下），一九五三年上半年已提高到五二八——七六八锭每分钟罗拉转数二三○上下。布机看车工，一九四九年看自动布机十二台、普通布机四台（自动换纬布机一七六转，普通布机一八○转），一九五三年上半年自动布机达到了三十二台，普通布机六至八台（自动换纬布机一八四转，普通布机一九四转）这就是说，在其他条件不变的情况下，劳动生产率提高了百分之二百左右。平均算来，现在的一个工人的生产抵上了五年前的两个。
    让我用一个工人的例子来说明这个变化。细纱女工李凤兰，从十一岁就进这个工厂，到现在已有了十一年的工龄。她在资本主义企业里做了几年工，只看三八四个锭子。公私合营以后，一九五一年工厂的党和工会号召并组织工人学习郝建秀工作法，在一两年里，使用同样的老车，她看锭能力已逐渐提高到八六四个锭子了。同样一个李凤兰，前后已判若两人。李凤兰在旧日一天站在机器旁边十小时、十二小时，只吃一个冷饽饽和一些咸菜，现在她有了手表，买了自行车，并住上了工人宿舍小楼房。她初做工时：“一进车间心里就害怕，站在机器旁边对着大片大片的开花（即断头），接了这头，断了那头，心里好不着慌，领班的闯上了，瞪起了眼珠子，张嘴就骂开了：‘懒做啊？家里吃去！’肚子饿，身上冷，心里又气又急，干活就是熬钟点，熬过一天算一天。”那时，熟练工人
  “泡厕所”的“泡厕所”，打盹的打盹，有谁会愿意把技术教给一个可怜的小姑娘呢？但是，在公私合营之后，当上级号召学习郝建秀工作法时，李凤兰早已懂得现在干活是为了谁的道理，她想：“郝建秀比我小，工龄才几年，她能为国家出那末大力，我为什么不行？”于是，她当众人还在观望怀疑的时候，就决心一定要学好操作法，而且她在初试不成功的时候，更忍受了那些有保守落后思想的人的讥笑，宁肯降低看锭数目也要学会掌握工作法。终于，她获胜了，她站到了伙伴们的前面，当选了全国纺织工业劳动模范。
    资本主义企业使李凤兰当了六年机器的奴隶，公私合营带给她新的生活，新的思想，也给予她钻研和提高技术的条件，她驾驭了机器，变成了生产战线上的能手。
    李凤兰现在是小组长。她经常想：“光我一个人看锭子多好，顶啥！生产计划总得靠大家伙来完成。”她不像在资本主义企业里的老工人那样地对待自己的技术。她一个月两次三次地在车间里表演操作法，每天下班后的生产会议她也抓得紧，特别是她理解新工人的困难，就格外耐心地教导他们。那些新近才进厂来的学徒工，和早年李凤兰的际遇可真不一样了，在学习半年看车之后，就能看上三百八十四个锭子。他们在技术上只要半年就走完了昔日李凤兰五六年所走的路。而不管是新工人，老工人，一样地把完成国家计划当成自己生活中的头等大事。
    公私合营之后，唐山华新纺织公司劳动生产率有了根本变化的原因就在这里。（附图片）
