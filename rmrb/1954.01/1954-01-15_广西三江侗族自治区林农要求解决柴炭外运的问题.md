    Guangxi Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region Forest Farmers Request Resolution of the Issue of Charcoal Transportation
    Tan Yiyi from Yongwei District Office of the People's Government of Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province, writes: The Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region is located in a place adjacent to Guangxi, Hunan, and Guizhou. The Rongjiang and Xunjiang Rivers converge there. The district is full of towering mountains and lush forests, and there are many forest farmers. They cut down fir trees and make some charcoal, then put the charcoal on wooden rafts and transport it down the river to Rong County and Liuzhou to exchange for the daily necessities they need.

    After liberation, the People's Government set up timber purchasing stations everywhere in the local area and formulated reasonable prices, purchasing a large amount of fir timber. This allowed Dong forest farmers to avoid exploitation by intermediaries when selling timber, which is of great benefit to the development of local forestry production. However, after the purchasing stations uniformly purchase and transport timber, they would rather increase the labor price for releasing wooden rafts than allow the forest farmers releasing the wooden rafts to transport charcoal along with them. As a result, not only is there a shortage of fuel supply in Liuzhou and other places, but more seriously, more than 10 million catties of charcoal produced annually in the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region, worth about 10 billion yuan, is stockpiled and cannot be transported out, and the lives of the Dong people have been greatly affected.

    What is the actual situation? Dong forest farmers have always been skilled in transporting charcoal on wooden rafts, and there is nothing unsafe about it. The transportation route for charcoal and timber is the same, and carrying charcoal will not affect the allocation of timber. And charcoal is very bulky, and it is very difficult to transport it with other means of transportation. Local forest farmers have repeatedly raised opinions with the People's Government and the forest industry departments, but they have not been resolved so far. Now is the peak season for charcoal sales, and it is hoped that the local leading organs will quickly study and resolve this issue.
      Editor's note: The situation reflected by reader Tan Yiyi is indeed the case. According to a letter from the Guangxi Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau: The wooden rafts released by the purchasing stations under the bureau are all insured with insurance companies. The Guangxi Provincial Insurance Company is afraid that charcoal will increase the weight of the wooden rafts and easily cause accidents, so it decided not to allow Dong forest farmers to carry charcoal. Of course, this decision directly affects the lives of Dong forest farmers. For this reason, the Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau has repeatedly negotiated with the Provincial Insurance Company, but has not been resolved so far.

      We believe that it is entirely necessary for the Guangxi Provincial Insurance Company to consider the issue from a safety point of view, but it is also necessary to appropriately take care of the local people's habits and vital interests under the possible conditions of ensuring safe transportation. Because if the demands of the forest farmers in the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region are not resolved quickly, it will not only involve the lives of many forest farmers in the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region, but also affect the fuel supply in Liuzhou and other places. Therefore, the Guangxi Provincial Insurance Company should comprehensively consider and find ways to solve this problem.

### 广西三江侗族自治区林农要求解决柴炭外运的问题

专栏：读者来信摘要

    广西三江侗族自治区林农要求解决柴炭外运的问题
    广西省三江侗族自治区人民政府涌尾区公所谭翼贻来信：三江侗族自治区位在广西和湖南、贵州毗邻的地方。溶江、浔江会流其中。区内丛山峻岭、茂林青葱，林农数量很多。他们砍伐杉木并制成一部分柴炭，然后把柴炭放在木排上顺江运送到融县和柳州等地，换回他们需要的日用品。
    解放后，人民政府在当地遍设木材收购站，制定了合理的价格，大量收购杉木。这使侗族林农在出售木材时免受中间剥削，对发展当地林业生产有很大作用。但是，收购站在统一收购和调运木材以后，就宁肯提高放运木排的工价，而不许放运木排的林农捎运柴炭。这样做的结果，不但柳州等地燃料供应发生困难，而更严重的是三江侗族自治区内年产一千余万斤、价值百亿元左右的柴炭积压不能外运，侗族人民的生活受到了很大的影响。
    实际情况怎样呢？侗族林农历来在木排上捎运柴炭，技术熟练，并没有什么不安全的地方。柴炭和木材运送途程是一致的，捎带柴炭也不会影响木材调拨。而柴炭很笨重，用其它运输工具运送是很困难的。当地林农曾一再向人民政府和森林工业部门提意见，但至今没有得到解决。现在已是柴炭旺销季节，希望当地领导机关迅速研究解决这个问题。
      编者按：读者谭翼贻反映的情况是确实的。据广西省森林工业局来信：该局所属收购站放运的木排都向保险公司投保。广西省保险公司唯恐柴炭加重木排重量，容易发生事故，就决定不让侗族林农捎带柴炭。当然这个决定直接影响了侗族林农的生活，为此，省森林工业局曾多次和省保险公司进行交涉，但迄今未获解决。
      我们认为，广西省保险公司从安全观点出发来考虑问题是完全必要的，但在不妨碍安全运输的可能条件下，适当地照顾当地人民习惯和切身利益，也是应该的。因为三江侗族自治区林农的要求，如果不迅速解决，不但牵涉到三江侗族自治区很多林农的生活，而且还影响了柳州等地的燃料供应，因此，广西省保险公司应该全面地来考虑和设法解决这个问题。
