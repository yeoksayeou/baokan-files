Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: According to a Vietnam News Agency report: A communique issued on the 29th stated that in the Red River Left Bank area of North Vietnam, military and civilians annihilated a total of 34,113 enemy soldiers in the year ending December 19, 1953.

The Red River Left Bank area is a densely populated region, encompassing the four provinces of Hưng Yên, Hải Dương, Kiến An, and Thái Bình, with a population of 2.5 million. In the past twelve months, French imperialists have exerted every effort to plunder the assets of civilians and frantically conscripted soldiers in this area, launching hundreds of "mopping-up operations" against guerrilla zones and guerrilla bases in an attempt to "pacify" the region. In particular, during the "mopping-up operations" north of Lục Giang in September and in the southern part of Thái Bình Province in December, the enemy concentrated forces of up to dozens of battalions.

The military and civilians in the Red River Left Bank area, in order to crush the enemy's conspiracy, carried out heroic struggles and inflicted heavy blows on the enemy. They not only crushed all "mopping-up operations," including the two large-scale "mopping-up operations" by enemy forces north of Lục Giang and in the southern part of Thái Bình Province, but also launched successful surprise attacks on the provincial capital of Thái Bình Province, the provincial capital of Kiến An Province, and Hải Phòng. At the same time, they tightly besieged dozens of enemy strongholds in Thái Bình and Hưng Yên provinces, forcing the enemy to use airplanes to supply these strongholds. They also established resistance governments in hundreds of villages.

The communique stated that in the year ending December 19, 1953, the military and civilians in the Red River Left Bank area annihilated a total of 34,113 enemy soldiers, including one colonel, one major, twenty-five captains, sixty lieutenants, twenty-one second lieutenants, and one hundred and seventy-three sergeants; seized 4,849 weapons of various kinds, including sixty-three cannons and mortars, 1,557 machine guns, 110 radio stations, and forty tons of ammunition; destroyed thirty-five cannons, 1,127 trucks and armored vehicles, seven locomotives, seventy-seven carriages, twenty-four gunboats and motorboats, five airplanes, ninety ammunition depots, 249 tons of military equipment, and millions of liters of gasoline; and damaged hundreds of miles of highways.

Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: According to a Vietnam News Agency report: A communique issued on the 30th stated that on December 23, the Vietnamese People's Army ambushed enemy troops on Highway 39, twenty kilometers northwest of the provincial capital of Thái Bình Province, killing over two hundred European and African enemy soldiers belonging to the 3rd Battalion of the 5th Foreign Legion.

The General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army has awarded the victorious People's Army unit with a First-Class Combat Medal.

On December 24, the People's Army attacked and removed the enemy stronghold of Kinh Đạo, forty kilometers southwest of Hanoi, seizing all of the enemy's weapons and ammunition.

On December 22, the People's Army intercepted a French military convoy on Highway 1 between Quảng Trị and Thừa Thiên provinces in central Vietnam, killing many enemy soldiers, including one major and one lieutenant.

Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: According to a Vietnam News Agency report on the 30th: The General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a detailed communique on the victorious achievements of the Vietnamese People's Army in annihilating and routing twenty-four enemy battalions in Lai Châu Province, stating:

The Vietnamese People's Army's pursuit and annihilation battle against the fleeing enemy in Lai Châu, which began on December 11, concluded victoriously on the 24th. None of the enemy troops who fled in panic from the provincial capital of Lai Châu were able to reach Điện Biên Phủ. The People's Army units annihilated or routed twenty-four enemy battalions, with over one thousand killed and captured. Currently, defeated enemy soldiers are emerging from their hiding places to surrender to the Vietnamese People's Army.

People's Army units seized seven hundred weapons of various types, including ten mortars and 151 machine guns; the spoils also included 10,000 liters of oil, 225 horses and donkeys, and thirty tons of ammunition.

With the exception of Điện Biên Phủ, the last French stronghold, the entire province of Lai Châu, with a population of 160,000, has been liberated. People's power has been established in the newly liberated areas.

The liberation of Lai Châu is a major victory achieved by the Vietnamese People's Army at the beginning of this winter campaign.

    红河左岸地区越南军民一年歼敌三万多名
    人民军追歼莱州逃敌的战斗已经胜利结束
    【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：二十九日发表的公报说，北越红河左岸地区的军民在到一九五三年十二月十九日为止的一年中，共歼灭敌军三万四千一百一十三名。
    红河左岸地区是一个人口稠密的地区。它包括兴安、海阳、建安、太平等四省和拥有二百五十万人口。在过去的十二个月中，法帝国主义者在这个地区竭力掠夺平民的资财和疯狂抓丁，并向游击区和游击基地发动了数百次“扫荡战”，企图“绥靖”这个地区。尤其是九月间在禄江以北地区和十二月间在太平省南部的“扫荡战”中，敌人集结的兵力多到几十个营。
    红河左岸地区的军民为粉碎敌人的阴谋，进行了英勇的斗争，给敌人以沉重的打击。他们不仅粉碎了包括敌军在禄江以北地区和太平省南部两次大规模“扫荡”在内的一切“扫荡战”，并曾向敌人盘踞的太平省省会、建安省省会和海防发动奇袭，获得了胜利。同时，他们紧紧包围了太平省和兴安省的几十个敌军据点，使敌人不得不用飞机来供应这些据点；他们并在几百个村庄建立抗战政权。
    公报说：在到一九五三年十二月十九日为止的一年中，红河左岸地区的军民共歼灭敌军三万四千一百一十三名，其中有上校一名、少校一名、上尉二十五名、中尉六十名、少尉二十一名、军士一百七十三名；缴获各种武器四千八百四十九件，其中有大炮和迫击炮六十三门、机枪一千五百五十七挺、电台一百一十部和弹药四十吨；击毁大炮三十五门、卡车和装甲车一千一百二十七辆、机车七辆、车厢七十七节、炮艇和汽艇二十四艘、飞机五架、军火库九十座、军事装备二百四十九吨、成百万公升的汽油；并破坏公路数百里。
    【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：三十日发表的公报说：越南人民军十二月二十三日在太平省省会西北二十公里的第三十九号公路上伏击敌军，击毙属于第五外籍军团第三营的欧、非籍敌军二百多名。
    越南人民军总司令部已授予这支获胜的人民军部队以一级战斗奖章。
    十二月二十四日，人民军袭击并拔除了河内西南四十公里的敌军据点荆道，缴获敌军的全部武器和弹药。
    十二月二十二日，人民军在中越广治和承天省之间的第一号公路上截击了一队法军运输车队，击毙敌军多人，其中有少校和中尉各一名。
    【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社三十日讯：越南人民军总司令部发表关于越南人民军歼灭和击溃莱州省的敌军共二十四个连的详细战绩公报说：
    越南人民军在十二月十一日开始对莱州逃敌的追歼战，已于二十四日胜利结束。从莱州省会仓皇逃跑的敌军，没有一支部队能够抵达奠边府。人民军部队歼灭或击溃敌军二十四个连，其中被击毙和被俘的有一千多名。目前，溃败敌军正纷纷从藏匿的地方出来向越南人民军投降。
    人民军部队缴获了各种类型的武器七百件，其中包括迫击炮十门，机枪一百五十一挺；战利品中还有石油一万公升，马匹和驴子二百二十五头，弹药三十吨。
    除法军的最后一个据点奠边府以外，拥有十六万人口的莱州省已告全部解放。人民政权已在新解放区建立起来。
    莱州的解放是越南人民军在这次冬季战役开始时所取得的重大胜利。
