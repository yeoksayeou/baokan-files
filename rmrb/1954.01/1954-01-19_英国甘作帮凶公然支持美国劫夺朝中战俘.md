Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: A British Foreign Office spokesman stated again on the 15th that the British government supports the U.S.'s heinous plan to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese POWs. He said that the British government believes that "the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should release the POWs under its custody on January 23rd."

The British government not only verbally supports the U.S. government's act of sabotaging the armistice agreement, but also actively assists the U.S. government in concealing the truth about its forced detention of POWs in practical actions. It is reported that since November of last year, the British authorities in Hong Kong, following the instructions of the U.S. side, have ordered the Hong Kong Post Office to step up the inspection and detention of newspapers and periodicals published in our country and sent to and from Hong Kong, paying special attention to the detention of newspapers and periodicals containing articles exposing the U.S.'s crime of forcibly detaining POWs. This inspection and detention is even carried out openly and blatantly in front of the senders. This action by the British authorities in Hong Kong once again proves that the British government is an accomplice to the U.S.'s crime of forcibly detaining POWs.

    英国甘作帮凶公然支持美国劫夺朝中战俘
    【新华社十七日讯】英国外交部发言人在十五日再次表示：英国政府支持美国强迫扣留朝中战俘的罪恶计划。他说，英国政府认为“中立国遣返委员会应当于一月二十三日释放其看管下的战俘”。
    英国政府不但在口头上支持美国政府这一破坏停战协定的行为，而且在实际行动上也竭力协助美国政府掩饰其强迫扣留战俘的真相。据悉：从去年十一月份起，香港英国当局遵照美国方面的意见，命令香港邮局加紧检查和扣留寄往香港和由香港寄出的我国出版的报纸和刊物，特别注意扣留刊有揭露美国强迫扣留战俘的罪行的文章的报纸刊物，这种检查和扣留甚至公然当着寄件人的面明目张胆地进行。香港英国当局这一行为，再次证明英国政府是美国强迫扣留战俘的罪行的帮凶。
