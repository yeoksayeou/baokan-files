Shenyang's factories, both state-owned and locally state-owned, manufactured hundreds of new products last year, powerfully supporting the nation's industrial construction.

Shenyang is one of the country's machine industrial bases. Over the past year, it has adapted to the demands of national industrial construction, undertaking the arduous and glorious task of trial-manufacturing new products. The factories in Shenyang under the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government successfully trial-produced 515 new types of machinery and electrical equipment last year, 180 of which had never been manufactured in our country before. The Heavy Machinery Plant manufactured 16 types of modern heavy machinery last year, including a large crusher for the metallurgical industry capable of crushing 700 to 800 tons of ore per hour; a ball mill for smelting the rare metal molybdenum; a plate rolling machine for boiler factories, shipbuilding factories, and locomotive factories, capable of pressing thick steel plates into semi-circles; and 20-ton and 50-ton hydraulic presses, 2-meter shears, 50-ton punches, and gas gate valves for the seamless steel tube plant in Anshan. The Transformer Factory trial-produced more than 90 different types of transformers, current and voltage transformers, and special test transformers last year, and also produced the largest domestic 20,000 kVA transformer, whose iron core alone weighs 16 tons. These products have been sent to Beijing, Chongqing, Hankou, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other places. The large 20,000 kVA transformer has become an important piece of equipment for the steel capital, Anshan. The First Machine Tool Plant and the Third Machine Tool Plant trial-produced new 1A65 and 111C lathes. The Second Machine Tool Plant trial-produced giant radial drilling machines and vertical drilling machines with electrical equipment. Some of these have already been produced in large quantities and are being supplied to various regions. The Shenyang Fan Factory trial-produced 37 types of fans last year, meeting the needs of modern mines, machinery factories, chemical factories, and textile factories. The factory's products have been supplied as far as Dihua and Hainan Island. This year, it plans to trial-produce 32 more of the latest Soviet-style fans. The High-Voltage Switch Factory trial-produced 36 types of Soviet-style high-voltage switches and 200 kW, 1,000 kW, and 3,000 kW hydro-generators last year, and also successfully trial-produced the first large domestic (6,000 kW) turbine. These hydropower equipment powerfully supported the hydraulic construction of Fujian, Yunnan, Anhui—especially the Huai River project. The Water Pump Factory trial-produced 13 types of water pumps last year and plans to trial-produce 29 more Soviet-style water pumps this year. Machine Factory No. 7 trial-produced five different air compressors and rock drills last year. The Mining Machinery Factory trial-produced nine types of heavy mining equipment and successfully smelted high-manganese steel. The Mining Machinery Plant produced Soviet-style mining equipment such as chain coal feeders and belt conveyors. The Low-Voltage Switch Factory trial-produced electrical control devices for combined coal mining machines, rock drills, and machine tools. The Wire Factory trial-produced seven types of high-voltage wires and cables. The Bulb Factory trial-produced 50 types of bulbs for different purposes last year, including mining lamps, locomotive lamps, ship lamps, automobile lamps, airplane lamps, and various signal indicator lamps, supplying North China and Northeast China. In addition, new products have appeared in metallurgical plants, screw factories, battery factories, bicycle factories, and other units.

In terms of light industry, the Rubber Factory trial-produced acid-resistant clothing, rubber boots, diving suits, and rubber boats for industrial construction last year. The Woolen Mill trial-produced 46 new products such as serge, melton, high-grade uniform cloth, melton cloth, and plush. These new products have been widely welcomed. The Shenyang Paper Mill trial-produced white board paper, hemp board paper, and kraft paper.

In terms of local state-owned industry, more than 250 different new products, large and small, were also trial-produced last year.

    沈阳市各工厂制造出数百种新产品
    沈阳市国营与地方国营工厂去年制造出数百种新产品，有力地支援了祖国的工业建设。
    沈阳是全国机器工业基地之一，一年来，它适应国家工业建设的要求，担负了艰巨而光荣的新产品试制任务。中央第一机械工业部所属在沈各厂去年共试制成功了五百一十五种新式机器电气装置，其中有一百八十种是我国从未制造过的。重型机器厂去年曾制造十六种现代化的重型机器，其中有供应冶金工业用的大型破碎机，每小时可击破矿石七百吨到八百吨；有供应冶炼稀有金属——钼用的球磨机；有供应锅炉制造厂、船舶制造厂和机车制造厂用的滚板机，可以把很厚的钢板压成半圆形；此外还有二十吨、五十吨水压机、二米剪床、五十吨冲床，以及鞍钢无缝钢管厂用的瓦斯闸门等。变压器厂去年试制九十多种不同类型的变压器、电流电压互感器、特种试验用的变压器，并且制出了国产最大型的二万千伏安变压器，只它的铁芯就有十六吨重。这些产品已送到北京、重庆、汉口、新疆、内蒙等各地去，二万千伏安的大型变压器已成为钢都鞍山的重要设备。第一机床厂和第三机床厂试制了一д六五和一一一C新式车床；第二机床厂试制了具有电气装置的巨型摇臂钻床和立式钻床。其中有的已大批生产，源源供应各地。沈阳扇风机厂去年试制了三十七种扇风机，供应了现代化矿山、机器厂、化学厂和纺织厂的需要。该厂产品最远的已供应到迪化和海南岛。今年，预定再试制三十二种苏式最新型的扇风机。高压开关厂去年试制了三十六种苏联式的高压开关和二百瓩、一千瓩、三千瓩的水轮发电机并又试制成功国产第一台大型（六千瓩）水轮机。这些水力发电设备有力地支援了福建、云南、安徽——特别是治淮工程的水力建设。水泵厂去年试制了十三种水泵，并预定今年再试制二十九种苏联式的水泵。机械七厂去年试制了五种不同的空气压缩机和凿岩机；矿山机械厂试制了九种重型矿山设备，并且熔炼高锰钢成功。矿山机器厂制成了链式送煤机和皮带运输机等苏联式的矿山装备。低压开关厂试制了联合采煤机、凿岩机、工作母机上的电气控制装置；电线厂试制了七种高压电线和电缆；灯泡厂去年试制五十种不同用途的灯泡，其中包括矿灯、机车灯、船舶灯、汽车灯、飞机灯以及各种信号指示灯，供应了华北和东北各地。此外，冶炼厂、螺钉厂、电池厂、自行车厂等单位都有不同的新产品出现。
    轻工业方面，橡胶厂去年曾试制了供应工业建设的耐酸衣，胶靴、潜水衣、胶船等。毛织厂试制了哔叽毛绒，高级制服呢、麦尔登呢、长毛绒等四十六种新产品，这些新产品已受到广泛欢迎；沈阳造纸厂试制了白板纸、麻板纸、牛皮纸。
    地方国营工业方面，去年也曾试制了二百五十多种大小不同的新产品。
