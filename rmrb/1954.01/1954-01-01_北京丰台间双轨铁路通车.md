The double-track railway between Beijing and Fengtai opened to traffic on New Year's Day.

Due to the increasing development of the capital's construction, the original railway line between Beijing and Fengtai was approaching saturation point in its traffic capacity. There were few trains, many people, and traffic safety was also affected. In order to change this situation, the Beijing Railway Administration decided to convert the original single-track railway trunk line into a double-track railway.

Seventeen hundred workers took on this arduous task with a fighting spirit. In the final stages of the project, the construction site was brightly lit every night, and the workers worked in tense shifts, finally completing the entire project thirty-two days ahead of schedule.

The road construction workers received strong support from other departments. For example, the staff of Majiapu Station transmitted orders and telephone calls to the site day and night, closely contacting the site. Nearby farmers also actively participated in the construction of this project. During the Liangshui River roadbed earthwork project, workers had to travel five kilometers to get soil. When the farmers found out, they immediately told the workers to take soil from the large soil heaps in their fields. They also took the initiative to help the workers build the trestle and sheds for the Liangshui River.

After the double-track railway between Beijing and Fengtai opens to traffic, the traffic capacity between the two places can be doubled, and the difficulties of passenger and freight transportation will be greatly reduced.

    北京丰台间双轨铁路通车
    北京与丰台间的双轨铁路，于元旦通车。
    由于首都建设事业日益发展，北京、丰台间原有铁路的行车能力已接近饱和点，车少人多，行车安全也受影响。为了改变这种情况，北京铁路管理局决定将原来的单轨铁路干线改修成双轨铁路。
    一千七百个工人，以战斗的姿态担负起这个艰巨的任务。在工程进行的最后阶段，每天晚上，工地上灯光通明，工人们紧张地轮班工作，终于提前三十二天胜利完成全部工程。
    修路的工人得到其他部门的大力支持。如马家堡车站工作人员昼夜给现场传送命令电话，密切地与现场联系。附近的农民也积极参加了这个工程的修建。在进行凉水河路基土方工程中，工人要跑到五公里地以外的地方才能取到土，农民知道后，马上叫工人从自己田里的大土堆上取土。他们还主动地帮助工人搭设凉水河的排架和工棚。
    北京、丰台间双轨铁路通车后，可使两地之间的行车能力增加一倍，客运货运的困难将大大减少。
