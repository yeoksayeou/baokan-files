Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th: A mock trial of fascist Senator McCarthy was held on January 6th at the St. Nicholas Arena in New York, under the auspices of the American Union of Retired Members Committee. Six thousand people attended the conference.

The prosecutor in the mock trial was Frank Serriani, a prominent American lawyer and former chairman of the Brooklyn Bar Association, and the assistant prosecutor was Ross Nixon. The jury included union workers and veterans of World War II and the Korean War. Witnesses included well-known writers, artists, university professors, union workers, heads of social organizations, and editors of well-known newspapers. These included famous writers Howard Fast, Albert Kahn, artist Rockwell Kent, International Fur Workers Union President Ben Gold, and American Committee on Africa Secretary Ephias Hunton.

Most of the witnesses who participated in the mock trial had been persecuted by McCarthy, and they recounted their personal experiences at the meeting. Speakers accused McCarthy of "conspiring to injure, oppress, and intimidate American citizens, preventing them from freely exercising and enjoying the rights granted to them by the American Constitution and laws."

The mock trial found McCarthy guilty of "insulting and intimidating American citizens and depriving them of their legitimate constitutional rights." This verdict was warmly supported by the people who attended the meeting.
