Qu Yaoli Agricultural Producers' Cooperative Writes to Industrial Model Worker Zhou Zhizhen
Resolving to Further Improve the Agricultural Producers' Cooperative

To Comrade Zhou Zhizhen, National Textile Industry Labor Model and female weaver at the State-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory:

Our cotton has long been harvested. The total output of seed cotton for the entire cooperative is 28,886 jin and 5 liang. As soon as the cotton was brought home, we carefully picked and sorted it, and sold it to the state in batches. Up to December last year, including the autumn grain levy, we supplied the state with more than 22,000 jin of cotton. We hope this cotton will soon reach the hands of our worker comrades, so they can weave beautiful and durable cloth for the people.

Originally, we estimated that the entire cooperative could harvest 31,000 jin of seed cotton last year. After our village appraisal team used the calculation method from the previous year to count the cotton plants and bolls, we estimated that our high-yield land could produce 737 jin per mu, and another 12 mu could produce more than 500 jin. However, due to excessive rainfall in the summer, 70% of the leaves and lower, older bolls of the cotton plants fell off. Although we delayed topping the plants to allow more late-stage bolls to develop on the upper part, the weight of each cotton boll was reduced by 30% compared to the past, and the actual yield was 3,000 jin less than the estimated yield. This should be stated clearly.

Although our cooperative's high-yield cotton fields did not complete the original high-yield plan due to the invasion of natural disasters such as wind, frost, disease, insects, and waterlogging, our yield was still the highest in the area due to our tenacious struggle against natural disasters. Qu Wenbo, the strongest individual farmer in our Quzhuangtou Village, harvested 255 jin of seed cotton per mu from his irrigated land. The best mutual aid team in the village, Liu Pingzhi's, harvested 410 jin of seed cotton per mu from its eight mu of high-yield irrigated cotton, which was 113 jin less than our cooperative's high-yield cotton. However, our production costs were relatively lower than the previous year. The total value of production investment for all households in the cooperative the year before last (before the cooperative was established) was equivalent to 136 shi and 8.1 sheng of wheat, accounting for 34.4% of the total income that year. Last year, the total investment of the cooperative was only 101 shi and 8 dou of wheat, accounting for 23.1% of the total income of the cooperative.

Increased yields and reduced costs have guaranteed an increase in the net income of all cooperative members. Compared to the previous year, one household in the cooperative's ten households earned more than 1 shi of grain (cotton income is also converted into wheat for calculation), six households earned more than 10 shi, and one household earned more than 20 shi. Only two households did not earn more than the previous year because the able-bodied people in their families were ill and rarely participated in labor throughout the year. But they also received care from the cooperative. They said: "Thanks to joining the cooperative, otherwise, we wouldn't be able to work when sick, and we wouldn't be able to make a living!" Old man Duan Ancai had a total of nine mu of cotton fields, and two mu were flooded last summer. If he had worked individually, how could he have endured it? But because he joined the cooperative, his income was still 1 shi and 6 dou more grain than the previous year.

Dear Comrade Zhou Zhizhen: The benefits of being organized are endless. Last spring, there was a light rain before the cotton began to be sown. In order to seize the moisture and sow, we held a meeting of cooperative members that evening and divided the work according to the specialties of each member. Ye Dianwa and Qu Yaokui were good at plowing, so they were assigned to operate the plows and open the furrows. Women who could not plow were specifically responsible for sowing. At the same time, the sowing sequence was arranged according to the size of the moisture content. The sandy soil with less moisture was planted first, and the beach land with more moisture was planted later. Sowing began on April 11th, and all the cotton fields of the cooperative were sown in three days, five or six days earlier than ordinary farmers. Due to timely sowing, the cotton seedlings in our cooperative emerged from the soil four or five days earlier than the general cotton seedlings in the village last year. In late May, aphids appeared on the cotton seedlings in our village. At that time, it was the time to harvest wheat. Individual farmers had to take care of harvesting wheat and could not take care of eliminating insects, and had to take care of eliminating insects and could not take care of harvesting wheat. Only our cooperative could take care of both.

The facts of our cooperative's existence for more than a year have educated the members and the farmers in the village. I remember when our cooperative was first established in the winter before last, some people did not believe in the benefits of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and they withdrew from the cooperative last spring. Now they regret it, and some have asked to join again. We have expressed a warm welcome to them.

After studying the general line of the state during the transition period, we have more clearly recognized our bright future. Now our agricultural producers' cooperative has grown to 36 households, more than twice its original size. We are accepting new members, conducting land appraisal, and re-electing the leadership of the cooperative. We are determined to further improve the cooperative and gradually develop it into a completely socialist agricultural producers' cooperative.

### 曲耀离农业生产合作社写信给工业劳动模范周志珍  决心进一步办好农业生产合作社

　　曲耀离农业生产合作社写信给工业劳动模范周志珍
　　决心进一步办好农业生产合作社全国纺织工业劳动模范国营天津第三棉纺织厂织布女工周志珍同志：
    我们的棉花早已收完了。全社籽棉总产量是两万八千八百八十六斤五两。棉花刚收回家，我们就细挑细拣分批把棉花卖给了国家。到去年十二月为止，连秋征的在内，我们一共供给国家棉花两万二千多斤。我们盼望这些棉花很快送到工人同志的手里，给人民织出漂亮、耐用的布。
    原来，我们预计全社去年能收三万一千斤籽棉。经过我们村评比小组用前年的计算方法清点棉株、棉铃后，估计我们的丰产地每亩可产到七百三十七斤，还有十二亩可产到五百斤以上。但由于夏季雨水过多，棉株叶部和下部的老桃百分之七十都脱落了，我们虽然延迟了打正顶，使上部又结了不少的后期棉铃，可是每个棉桃的份量却较以往减少了百分之三十，实产量较预计产量少了三千来斤。这是应该声明的。
    我们社的丰产棉田，虽因风、冻、病、虫、涝等自然灾害的侵袭，没有完成原来的丰产计划；但由于我们和自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，我们的产量在当地说来还是最高的。我们曲庄头村劳力最强的单干农民曲文波的水地棉花每亩收籽棉二百五十五斤；村里最好的刘萍芝互助组的八亩水地丰产棉花，每亩实收籽棉四百一十斤，比我们社的丰产棉花每亩少收一百一十三斤。可是我们的生产成本却相对地较前年降低了。前年（未建社前）全社各户的生产投资总值折合小麦一百三十六石零八升一，占前年总收入的百分之三十四点四；去年全社总投资只一百零一石八斗麦子，占全社总收入的百分之二十三点一。
    产量提高了，成本降低了，这就保证了全体社员纯收入的增加。全社十户社员，较前年多收入粮食（棉花收入也折成麦子计算）一石以上的一户，十石以上的六户，二十石以上的一户；只有两户因为家里有劳动力的人害了病，全年很少参加劳动，收入没比前年多。但他们也得到了合作社照顾，他们说：“多亏入了社，不然，有病不能做活，生活就会没办法了！”段安才老汉共有九亩棉花地，去年夏天被水淹坏了二亩，如果他单干的话，哪能受得了？可是因为他入了社，收入还比前年多了一石六斗粮食。
    亲爱的周志珍同志：组织起来的好处是说不完的。去年春天，棉花开始下种前落了一场小雨。为了抢墒下种，当天晚上我们就开了个社员会，根据各个社员的特长分了工；叶典娃、曲耀奎犁地是好把式，就让他们掌犁开沟；不会犁地的妇女专门负责撒种。同时按照墒度大小安排了播种顺序，墒小的沙土地就先种，墒饱的滩地就迟种。四月十一日开始下种，全社的棉田三天就种完了，比一般农民提早种完五、六天。由于下种适时，我们社去年的棉苗比村里一般的棉苗早出土三、四天。五月下旬，我们村棉苗生了蚜虫，当时正是割麦子的时候，单干农民顾了割麦就顾不上灭虫，顾了灭虫又顾不了割麦，只有我们合作社能够两头兼顾。
    我们社成立一年多来的事实，教育了社员和村里的农民们。记得前年冬天我社刚成立时，有些人还不相信农业生产合作社的好处，去年春天退了社。如今他们后悔了，有的又要求参加，我们对他们都表示非常欢迎。
    学了国家过渡时期的总路线后，我们更明确地认清了我们的光明前途。现在我们的农业生产合作社已经发展到三十六户，比原来扩大了两倍多。我们正在接受新社员入社，进行土地评产，并改选合作社的领导机构。我们决心把合作社进一步办好，逐步发展成完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。
