Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Cooperative Leads Farmers in the Whole Township to Organize
By Our Correspondent Zhang Rongan

Last autumn, when the Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shahe Township, Licheng County, Shandong Province, was recruiting new members, farmers in the township scrambled to join. Farmer Wang Jinquan, eager to be among the first to join, submitted his application without consulting his family. His mother and wife were furious:
"What? You can join the agricultural cooperative, but we can't?" Every time there was a new member meeting, the three of them went together, vying with each other and refusing to give way.

The emotions of the farmers in Shahe Township are understandable because the Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative reaped a large grain harvest, and the members received high dividends. Whether they were relatively poor members or relatively wealthy members, their incomes increased, and their lives became prosperous.

After Shahe Township was liberated in 1948, the People's Government supported farmers in organizing mutual aid teams for production, and grain output increased year by year. By 1953, the total output of the township had increased by 50% compared to before liberation. However, mutual aid teams had a fundamental problem – the contradiction between collective labor and decentralized management could not be resolved. This prevented the land from quickly increasing its yield and prevented farmers from increasing their income in many ways. Especially when faced with natural disasters or illnesses, it could also lead to class differentiation. In 1953, among the 766 households in the township, nearly 100 were selling or mortgaging their land.

After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, not only were the above contradictions overcome, and class differentiation was greatly curbed, but also production efficiency was improved in all aspects, and many difficulties were overcome. The Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative was established at the end of September 1952, which was the busy season for autumn harvest and autumn planting. Generally, mutual aid teams and individual households were limited by manpower and had to harvest autumn crops before planting wheat, which often meant that wheat could not be planted in a timely manner. The agricultural production cooperative used its advantageous manpower to carry out autumn harvest and autumn planting simultaneously, and meticulously. They used new-style walking plows to deeply plow the land twice (eight inches deep). They also applied 8,000 catties of manure as base fertilizer in the wheat fields, used dense planting methods, and selected "438" improved wheat varieties as seeds. The planting was completed before the Autumn Equinox, which was faster than general mutual aid teams and individual farmers. After planting wheat, they deeply plowed the land twice for the spring planting in the following year.

Throughout the year, the agricultural production cooperative was ahead of the whole village in whatever work they did, and they did it more meticulously than those outside the cooperative, winning a bumper harvest for the whole year: wheat averaged 652.9 catties per mu, an increase of 63% compared to local farmers; millet averaged 909.3 catties per mu, an increase of 56.7% compared to local farmers; sorghum averaged 511 catties per mu, an increase of 34.5% compared to local farmers.

The sideline production in the Wang Zhaoyou cooperative also achieved great results. One sideline team had eleven straw bag weaving machines, producing 15,420 straw bags throughout the year, earning a net profit of 20.74 million yuan, equivalent to 25,000 catties of grain. 19,354 catties were invested in agricultural production (fertilizer, seeds), and 5,647 catties were spent on agricultural construction (purchasing livestock, farm tools, and repairing farm tools), which strongly supported agricultural production.

The Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative has only been operating for just over a year, and not only have the relatively poor members' lives improved, but also the relatively wealthy members have greatly increased their incomes. For example, member Wang Chaoguang, with eight family members, 8.2 mu of land, and one head of cattle, had a total output of 8,112 catties in 1952 before joining the cooperative, with a net income of 5,549 catties after deducting production costs. After joining the cooperative in 1953, his net income was 8,456 catties of grain.

Now, no one in Shahe Township says that the Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative is no good, but it was not like this at the beginning. When the Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative was first established, among the nineteen members, only Wang Chaoguang was a relatively wealthy middle peasant, with labor, land, and livestock. Other members lacked land or strong labor, and generally lacked livestock and farm tools. Some people in the township looked down on them, saying, "Can this group of people increase production when they get together!" Especially some wealthy farmers with strong manpower and livestock, who didn't speak openly, but were unconvinced in their hearts. They secretly competed with the Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative, "Let's see who is stronger!"

Among those who competed with the Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative, the most obvious were two. One was Duan Shoupiao, with ten family members, ten mu of land, two strong laborers, and one mule, with capital for production, buying enough fertilizer in the spring for the whole year. The other was Wang Jizhen, with five family members, six mu of land, and one head of cattle. Both were members of mutual aid teams and were well-known experts in growing crops in the township.

The Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative had eight fen of wheat field in the southwest of the village, where Duan Shoupiao also had one mu. The cooperative's land belonged to member Wang Chaojun, who had never been surpassed in yield by his neighbor Duan Shoupiao. In the east of the village, the cooperative had 2.8 mu of wheat field, where Wang Jizhen also had eight fen. When planting wheat the year before, the cooperative's wheat field was plowed eight inches deep, using dense planting methods, and planted with "438" improved wheat varieties. Duan Shoupiao and Wang Jizhen believed in their own farming methods, plowing only four inches deep and planting ordinary wheat varieties using old methods. Last spring, the agricultural cooperative applied 27 catties of chemical fertilizer per mu as topdressing and watered it once. Duan Shoupiao believed that his land had a good foundation and did not need topdressing, but he also watered it once, although a little late due to a shortage of labor. Wang Jizhen applied 20 catties of chemical fertilizer per mu as topdressing and watered it twice. However, because it was late, the topdressing and water not only failed to work, but because the ears of wheat were already ripe, the energy was used to make the lower part grow "second sprouts," greatly reducing the harvest. As a result, Duan Shoupiao's wheat yielded 100 catties less per mu than the cooperative's wheat, and Wang Jizhen's yield was 400 catties less per mu than the cooperative's. Duan Shoupiao, who had never admitted that his crop growing was inferior to others, said to others this time: "I can't compare with them." Last autumn, these two crop-growing experts both joined the Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative.

Under the guidance of the general line of the state during the transition period, and with the facts of the Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative before their eyes, the farmers of Shahe Township became even clearer. Not only did the poor peasants see that the small-scale peasant economy was the root of all poverty and disasters, but even the relatively wealthy peasants saw that the capitalist road was not as good as the socialist road. When discussing the general line, poor peasant Su Chuansheng said: "I originally had seven fen of land, and after marrying a wife who brought a child, things got worse. With just seven fen of land for three people, we will never get rich without taking the socialist road." Wang Shengzi, a wealthy middle peasant who recently joined the Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative, said: "I saved more than 4,000 catties of grain a year, intending to buy houses and land and live the life of a landlord. Now my mind is clear, the landlord's road is impassable. I sold 3,500 catties of my savings to the state. I will not only join the agricultural production cooperative, but also join the supply and marketing cooperative."

After the farmers of Shahe Township recognized the road they should take, their desire to join the agricultural production cooperative rose universally. Out of more than 700 households in the township, 310 households applied to join the agricultural production cooperative. Thirty-nine households have already joined the Wang Zhaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative, and 202 households have formed nine new cooperatives. Mutual aid teams have also seen new development: eleven new mutual aid teams were organized last winter. Of the original sixty-four mutual aid teams, ten were transformed into agricultural production cooperatives, and the rest were reorganized and improved. The twenty-two mutual aid teams that had disintegrated last autumn have now been restored and consolidated. Many mutual aid teams that did not meet the conditions for establishing agricultural production cooperatives and individual households that did not join the cooperative are also in high spirits, actively preparing conditions for joining the cooperative. Now, the farmers of the township are actively engaged in winter production, striving for the early realization of socialism.

　　王朝佑农业合作社带动全乡农民组织起来
    本报记者　张荣安
    去年秋后，山东历城县沙河乡王朝佑农业生产合作社吸收新社员时，这个乡的农民争着参加。农民王进全为着抢先入社，没来得及跟家里的人商量，就递了申请书，他的母亲和老婆都冒火了：
  “怎么？你能参加农业社，俺就不能？”每逢开新社员会，三个人一起去，赌着劲儿谁也不让谁。
    沙河乡农民的这种情绪是可以理解的，原因是王朝佑农业生产合作社收的粮食多，社员分红多。不管原先是比较困难的社员，还是比较富裕的社员，收入都增加了，光景都过得富裕了。
    沙河乡在一九四八年解放后，人民政府扶持农民组织互助组进行生产，粮食产量逐年提高，到一九五三年，全乡总产量比解放前增长了百分之五十。但是，互助组有个根本问题——集体劳动和分散经营的矛盾解决不了。这就使土地不能很快提高产量，不能使农民多方面增加收入。特别是碰到天灾病祸，还会引起阶级分化，一九五三年全乡七百六十六户人家中，竟有百来户出卖和出典土地。
    成立农业生产合作社后，不仅克服了上述矛盾，极大地制止了阶级分化，还从各方面提高了生产效率，克服了许许多多的困难。王朝佑农业生产合作社一九五二年九月底成立时，正是秋收秋种的繁忙季节，一般互助组和单干户为人力所限，都是先收秋后种麦，往往种麦不能适时。农业生产合作社就利用了自己的优势人力，秋收秋种同时进行，而且作的细致。他们用新式步犁把地深耕过两遍（八寸深）。在麦地里又上了八千斤大粪作基肥，用密植方法播种，选用“四三八”优种小麦作种子；秋分前就种完了，比一般互助组和单干农户在时间上都来得快。种完麦又把第二年春种地深耕过两遍。
  一年来，农业生产合作社无论什么活儿，都作在全村前头，都作得比社外细致，赢得了全年丰收：小麦平均每亩六百五十二点九斤，比当地农民增产百分之六十三；谷子每亩平均九百零九点三斤，比当地农民增产百分之五十六点七；高粱每亩平均五百十一斤，比当地农民增产百分之三十四点五。
    王朝佑社里的副业生产也很有成绩。一个副业队有十一盘打草包机，全年打草包一万五千四百二十个，净赚二千零七十四万元，折谷二万五千斤。给农业投资（肥料、种籽）一万九千三百五十四斤；开支农业建设费（购买牲畜、农具和修理农具）五千六百四十七斤。有力地支援了农业生产。
    王朝佑农业生产合作社才办了一年多，不仅原先较贫困社员的光景过好了，就是那些原先较富裕的社员也大大地增加了收入。像社员王朝广，八口人，八亩二分地，一头牛，一九五二年没参加社前，全年总产量八千一百十二斤，除去生产投资，净收入五千五百四十九斤。一九五三年参加社后，净收入粮食八千四百五十六斤。
    现在，沙河乡已经没有一个人说王朝佑农业生产合作社不行了，可是开头并不是这样。当王朝佑农业生产合作社刚成立时，十九户社员里只有王朝广是个较富裕的中农，有劳力、有土地、有牲畜，别的社员不是缺土地就是没强壮劳动力，普遍缺少牲畜和农具。乡里有些人看不起他们。说：“这伙人到一块儿还能增产！”特别是一些兵强马壮的富裕农民，表面上不说话，心眼儿里却不服气。他们暗地里跟王朝佑农业生产合作社比赛，“看看谁比谁强！”
    跟王朝佑农业生产合作社比赛的人当中，最明显的有两个。一个是段守璞，十口人，十亩地，两个强劳动力，一头骡子，生产有资本，春天买下粪够一年用。一个是王继祯，五口人，六亩地，一头牛。两个人都是互助组员，又都是全乡有名的种庄稼能手。
    王朝佑农业生产合作社在村西南有八分麦地，段守璞在那里也有一亩。社的那块地是社员王朝俊的，从来没有在产量上压倒他的邻居段守璞。在村东社里有二亩八分麦地，王继祯在那里也有八分。前年种麦时，社里的麦地刨了八寸深，用密植的方法，种上“四三八”优种小麦；段守璞、王继祯相信自己的耕作法，只耕了四寸深，用老办法播种了普通麦种。去年春天，农业社每亩麦地上了二十七斤化学肥料作追肥，并用水浇了一遍。段守璞相信自己的地有根基，用不着上追肥，却也浇了一遍；不过因劳力不凑手，浇的迟了一点。王继祯照样每亩地上了二十斤化学肥料作追肥，并浇了两遍；也是因为晚了，追肥和水不仅没使上劲，反而因为上面麦穗已熟，劲都用到下面，生起“二芽子”来，收成大减。结果，段守璞的小麦比社的小麦，一亩地少收一百斤；王继祯一亩地也比社的少收四百斤。从来没有承认过自己种庄稼不如人的段守璞，这回对别人说：“我比不上他们。”去年秋后，这二位种庄稼能手都加入了王朝佑农业生产合作社。
    沙河乡的农民，在国家过渡时期总路线的照耀下，眼前又摆着王朝佑农业生产合作社的事实，人们的心眼儿更亮了。不仅贫苦农民看清了小农经济是一切贫困、灾难的根源，就是较富裕的农民，也看清了资本主义道路没有社会主义的道路好。在讨论总路线时，贫农苏传盛说：“俺原先有七分地，娶了一个老婆带来一个孩子，光景就不好了；三口人凭这七分地，不走社会主义的道路，一辈子也过不富裕。”新参加王朝佑农业生产合作社的富裕中农王盛滋说：“俺年时存下四千多斤粮食，准备买房买地过地主生活；现在俺心眼儿亮了，地主的道路走不通，俺把三千五百斤存粮卖给国家；俺不光参加农业生产合作社，还要参加供销社。”
    沙河乡的农民，认清了自己应走的道路以后，参加农业生产合作社的愿望普遍高涨。全乡七百多户，就有三百一十户申请加入农业生产合作社。已有三十九户参加了王朝佑农业生产合作社，有二百零二户另外组成九个新社。互助组也有新的发展：去年冬天新组织起来的互助组有十一个；原有的六十四个互助组除有十个转为农业生产合作社外，其余也都经过整顿，提高了一步。原先有二十二个互助组在去年秋收时已经涣散解体，现在又重新恢复和巩固起来了。许多因条件不够没有成立农业生产合作社的互助组和没有加入合作社的单干户，情绪也很高涨，积极为入社准备条件。现在全乡农民正积极进行冬季生产，争取社会主义早日实现。
