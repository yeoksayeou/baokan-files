Recently, factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Kaifeng and other cities have launched worker-peasant get-together activities, inviting nearby farmers to visit the factories or organizing delegations to visit the countryside. Everywhere is filled with an atmosphere of unity and friendship.

The farmers were warmly welcomed by the workers when they visited the factories. When the farmers visiting Tianjin Steel Plant arrived at the first branch factory, some of the workers who were about to get off work stayed at the factory to receive them. The Party Secretary and the Chairman of the Labor Union of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, along with labor models, personally entertained more than 300 farmer representatives who came to visit. Kaifeng Machinery Factory labor model Liu Yongsheng, who has a sore throat, still explained the production situation to the farmers in detail despite his hoarse voice. When the workers visited the countryside, they were also warmly received by the farmers. On the day when the workers from North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory visited Zhang Guozhuang, the members of the Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative brought out the peanuts they had grown and the freshly cooked sweet potatoes to entertain them.

Many farmers expressed their heartfelt admiration for the workers' intense labor after visiting the factories. Ren Guangfu, a farmer from the eastern suburbs of Tianjin, said after visiting the state-owned Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory: "I used to think that it was nice for workers to work in a warm room. Today I see that they have to watch dozens of looms by themselves, how intense their work is!" Farmers from the suburbs of Kaifeng City were surprised to learn that more than 180 workers at Tianfeng Flour Company produce 5,500 bags of flour every day. Farmer Qi Qingyang calculated that one machine grinds 280,000 jin of wheat a day, which is equivalent to 2,800 livestock grinding for a day. The flour ground by one worker in one day is equivalent to the flour ground by one farmer in half a month. A worker from Renjing Village in the suburbs of Shenyang City held a get-together with the farmers when he returned to his hometown for the New Year. Wang Huanjin, the chairman of the production cooperative in the village, said at the meeting: "Once I went to a factory in the city and saw the workers working hard in the workshop. I asked around and found that none of them were absent from work. The workers said to me: 'The upper and lower processes in the factory are closely connected. If you are absent from work, it will affect production.' We have times when we hang up our hoes and times when we are idle in winter, which is much worse than the workers! Besides, it is right for the workers to earn more wages, because the workers spend money on everything they eat, live and use in the city, isn't it?" After listening to the propaganda of the propaganda team of Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory, a model of high yield from Xutan Village in Taiyuan recalled the great assistance of the working class to the farmers in the past four years and realized that: Only under the leadership of the working class can the farmers live a good life of "lighting lamps without oil and farming without cattle". He said: "Why did our supply and marketing cooperative only have three people before, but now it has more than a dozen people and they are still too busy? The main reason is that the workers produce more things, and the prices are also cheaper, and the purchasing power of the farmers has also increased."

After visiting the countryside, the workers also improved their understanding. Yan Xinghua, a railway worker from Yueyang, Hunan, participated in the rural visit group in Yueyang area and visited the farmers in Hubin Township. He went to the home of a soldier's family, Aunt Liu, and saw that the old lady was cooking rice, mixed with some sweet potato heads. The old lady said: The good sweet potatoes should be picked and sold on the street, and the bad ones should be chosen for themselves. When Yan Xinghua heard this, he remembered that some workers usually cook rice with only white rice and always complain that it is not white enough, and they always pick and choose when they buy sweet potatoes and say they are not good. Compared with the farmers, they are really a little embarrassed. The old lady also told him: Two people can only harvest more than 30 dan of rice and more than 40 dan of sweet potatoes in one year. Yan Xinghua calculated: Even if they harvest 35 dan of rice! If each dan is worth 60,000 yuan, it is only 2,100,000 yuan; 45 dan of sweet potatoes, each dan is worth 15,000 yuan, it is only 675,000 yuan, and the total income of two farmers in one year is less than 3,000,000 yuan. He thought: "The lowest wage of our railway workers is more than 3,000,000 yuan a year! But some of our workers still complain that their wages are low and they don't work hard, that is really not thinking about the farmers." After visiting the countryside, Yan Xinghua realized: "The workers have a great responsibility for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Now, the workers should work hard and strive to help the farmers develop production. In socialist society, the lives of workers and farmers will be completely improved." Yang Yaopo, the leader of the scribing team in the steel beam workshop of Fengtai Bridge Factory, said at a small get-together with the farmers: The worker-peasant alliance is the basic force for our country to build socialism and complete socialist transformation, that's right! He represented their team and promised to complete the production task for the first quarter. Let the Sha (Cheng) Feng (Tai) line open to traffic as soon as possible, so that farmers can burn Datong coal and buy cheap woolen goods as soon as possible. At the meeting, some workers also reviewed their past mistakes of not cherishing farmers' crops and promised to educate their children not to pull seedlings or vegetables. After learning about the farmers' opinions on waterwheels, the leaders of Liaoxi Iron Factory realized that poor waterwheel quality affects agricultural production, which affects socialist construction, so each workshop and team checked the shortcomings of not paying attention to quality in the past, and some teams also re-examined the waterwheels that had already been produced.

Through get-togethers, visits, and discussions, the connection between workers and peasants has become closer. When the workers and peasants of each factory parted, they exchanged mailing addresses and encouraged each other: to make more machines, produce more grain, and work together to build socialism. After the workers of Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory went to the countryside to conduct propaganda, they reviewed the erroneous view of attaching importance to quantity but not quality in the past. More than 600 workers have made plans not to ask for leave during the Spring Festival. The farmers who were visited wrote 13 letters to the employees of the factory, saying in the letters: to speed up production, participate in agricultural production cooperatives, and take the socialist road.

### 北京沈阳等市展开工农联欢活动

　　北京沈阳等市展开工农联欢活动
    最近，北京、天津、沈阳、开封等地工厂展开了工农联欢活动，纷纷邀请附近农民到厂参观或组织代表团下乡访问。到处洋溢着团结、友爱的气氛。
    各地农民到工厂参观时，受到了工人热烈的欢迎。访问天津钢厂的农民到达一分厂时，有些正要下班的职工，就留在厂里接待他们。石景山钢铁厂党委书记、工会主席和劳动模范亲自招待前往参观的三百多农民代表。开封机械厂劳动模范刘永盛喉咙有病，还哑着嗓子向农民详细介绍了生产情况。工人下乡访问时，同样受到了农民亲切的招待。华北农业机械总厂工人到张郭庄访问的那一天，张郭庄农业生产合作社的社员把自己亲手种的花生和刚出锅的白薯端出来招待他们。
    许多农民参观工厂后对工人的紧张劳动表示衷心的敬佩。天津东郊区农民任光甫参观国营天津第四棉纺织厂后说：“我从前认为工人在暖烘烘的屋子里干活很美。今天一看，才知他们一个人要看几十台织布机，工作多么紧张啊！”开封市郊区的农民到天丰面粉公司参观时，听说一百八十多个工人，每天出面粉五千五百袋，很惊奇。农民齐庆扬算了算，一台机器一天磨二十八万斤麦子，顶村里二千八百多个牲口磨一天。一个工人一天磨的面，顶一个农民磨半个月。家在沈阳市郊仁镜村的工人新年回乡和农民开了个联欢会。该村生产合作社主席王焕金在会上说：“有一次我上城里工厂参观，见工人在车间一个劲的猛干，我一打听，没一个旷工的。工人对我说：‘工厂里上下工序都是紧接着的，你若旷工就要影响生产。’我们一年有挂锄的时候，有冬闲的时候，和工人比，差多啦！再说工人工薪多一点，也是应当的，工人在城里吃的、住的、用的，那样不花钱？”太原许坦村一位丰产模范听了太原晋生纺织厂工人宣传队的宣传，回想起四年来工人阶级对农民的巨大援助，认识到：只有在工人阶级的领导下，农民才能过“点灯不用油，耕地不用牛”的好生活。他说：“为什么我们的供销合作社从前只有三个人，现在有十几个人还忙不过来呢？主要原因就是工人生产出来的东西多了，价格也便宜了，农民的购买力也提高了。”
    工人到农村访问后，认识也提高了一步。湖南岳阳铁路工人阎兴华参加岳阳地区农村访问团，访问了湖滨乡的农民。他走到一家光荣军属刘大娘的家里，看见老大娘正在煮饭，饭里掺了些红薯头。老大娘说：好的红薯要挑到街上去卖，自己吃要选些差的。阎兴华听了这话，想起有些工人平日煮饭净是白米还老嫌不白，买点红薯总是左挑右选说不好，和农民比起来，真有些不好意思。老大娘又告诉他：两个人在地里忙上一年，才能打三十几担谷子，四十几担红薯。阎兴华算了算：就算打三十五担谷吧！每担算六万元，才二百一十万元；四十五担红薯，每担一万五千元，也不过六十七万五千元，两个农民一年的总收入还不到三百万元。他想：“我们铁路工人最低的工资一年也不只三百万元呀！可是我们有的工人还总嫌工资低，不好好干活，那真是没有替农民着想。”访问农村之后阎兴华认识到：“工人对巩固工农联盟负有很大责任。现在，工人应当艰苦奋斗，努力帮助农民发展生产。到了社会主义社会，工人和农民的生活就能彻底改善了。”丰台桥梁工厂钢梁车间画线组工长杨耀坡在和农民举行的一个小型联欢会上说：工农联盟是我国建设社会主义和完成社会主义改造的基本力量，这话太对啦！他代表他们小组提出保证要完成第一季度生产任务。让沙（城）丰（台）线早日通车，使农民早日烧到大同煤和买到便宜的毛货。会上一些工人还检讨了自己过去不爱惜农民庄稼的错误，保证要教育小孩不拔苗、不拔菜。辽西铁工厂派干部到各地了解农民对水车的意见后，认识到水车质量不好影响农业生产，就是影响社会主义建设，所以各车间、小组纷纷检查过去不重视质量的缺点，有的小组还把已生产出来的水车重新作了检查。
    经过联欢、访问、座谈，工农间的联系更加密切了。各厂工人和农民在临别时，都交换了通讯地址，互相鼓励：多造机器，多产粮食，齐心合力建设社会主义。太原晋生纺织厂工人下乡宣传后，对以往重量不重质的错误观点作了检查。有六百余工人订出春节不请假的计划。被访问的农民给该厂职工写去十三封信，信里表示：要加紧生产，参加农业生产合作社，走社会主义的路。
