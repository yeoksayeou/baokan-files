Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th – Special correspondent report: According to U.S. news agency reports, Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission Chairman General Timayya wrote to United Nations Commander-in-Chief Hull on the 18th, saying that if the U.S. takes unilateral action to "release" prisoners of war on January 23rd, it would be violating the armistice agreement's "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

Hull wrote to Timayya on the 16th, saying that the U.S. was prepared to receive the Korean and Chinese POWs returned to the U.S. by the Indian Custodial Forces on January 20th, but would still "release" the POWs at 00:01 on January 23rd.

In his letter on the 18th, Timayya said, "I have pointed out that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission believes that any unilateral action by the parties concerned to change the identity and treatment of prisoners of war is inconsistent with the 'scope of authority' mentioned above."

General Timayya's pointing out that the U.S.'s planned unilateral act of "releasing" prisoners of war is a violation of the "scope of authority" is absolutely necessary. But more importantly, Timayya should retract his proposal to return the prisoners of war to the original detaining party, and extend the explanation period according to the proposals already announced by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and keep the prisoners of war for political conference disposal. This is the only feasible way to prevent the U.S. from violating the "scope of authority" through unilateral actions.

    蒂迈雅指出美方“释放”战俘违反“职权范围”
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者报道：据美方通讯社消息，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军在十八日写信给联合国军总司令赫尔说，美方如果在一月二十三日采取“释放”战俘的片面行动，就是违反了停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”。
    赫尔在十六日曾写信给蒂迈雅说，美方准备在一月二十日接收印度看管部队交还给美方的朝中战俘，但是仍将在一月二十三日零点一分将战俘“释放”。
    蒂迈雅在十八日的信中说，“我已指出，中立国遣返委员会认为，有关双方关于改变战俘的身份和处理的任何片面行动，都是不符合上面所说的‘职权范围’的。”
    蒂迈雅将军指出美方准备“释放”战俘的片面行为是违反“职权范围”的，这是完全必要的。但是更重要的是蒂迈雅应该收回他的将战俘交还原拘留一方的主张，并根据中立国遣返委员会早已公布的主张延长解释期限，并将战俘留待政治会议处理。这才是防止美方违反“职权范围”的片面行为的唯一可行的办法。
