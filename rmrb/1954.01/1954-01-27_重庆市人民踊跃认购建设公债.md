Chongqing residents from all walks of life are enthusiastically subscribing to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds.

The broad masses of workers in Chongqing have fully demonstrated a high degree of patriotism in subscribing to the bonds. Workers in the textile, maritime, construction, and transportation systems had basically completed their subscriptions by the 14th. The subscription amount of each unit greatly exceeded the expected amount.

Cadres in Chongqing's government agencies, recognizing the important significance of the state issuing economic construction bonds and realizing the state's socialist industrialization, are taking out part of their savings or money they can save to purchase bonds. Cadres from the departments under the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the agencies under the Municipal People's Government greatly exceeded the predetermined figures. Many cadres from the Industrial Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party who were working in factories proposed their subscription figures over the phone. Xiao Huaqing, Deputy Director of the Chongqing Municipal Cultural and Educational Committee, wrote back from Shenyang to subscribe to one million yuan in bonds after returning from a visit to Korea with the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea. Many cadres of the Municipal Finance Bureau proposed their subscription amounts on the second day after the Central People's Government issued the bond order, and some even paid in advance.

The cadres of the Chongqing Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have displayed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm in subscribing to the bonds. Many soldiers, despite repeated persuasion and explanation from their leaders, still requested to use their accumulated allowances to purchase bonds.

Chongqing's democratic parties and people's organizations warmly support the state's issuance of economic construction bonds. All the staff members of the preparatory committee of the Chongqing branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang conducted subscription work on the spot after holding a symposium on January 8, and the subscription amount exceeded the predetermined amount by 523 percent. The staff of the Chongqing branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association overfulfilled the task of subscribing to bonds in half a day on the 6th. People's organizations such as the Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions, the Democratic Women's Federation, the Federation of Literary and Art Workers, and the Democratic Youth Federation, etc., have successfully completed their subscription work on January 9.

Faculty and staff of large, medium, and primary schools in Chongqing are also enthusiastically subscribing. Xie Lihui, President of Southwest Normal College, made a mobilization report on subscribing to bonds to all faculty and staff on the 11th. Within one hour after the report, two departments and eight administrative units completed their subscription work. The total subscription amount of the entire college exceeded the estimated amount by more than three times. Residents in various street sections of Chongqing have also begun subscription work. The residents are in high spirits, and some residential groups have purchased several million yuan of bonds.

Private industrialists and merchants in Chongqing have also begun subscribing since the 17th.
