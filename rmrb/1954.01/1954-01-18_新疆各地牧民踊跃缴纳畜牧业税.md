Xinhua News Agency report: To further develop animal husbandry production, Xinjiang Province reduced animal husbandry taxes in 1953, and pastoralists in various regions enthusiastically paid the tax. After the liberation of Xinjiang, the People's Government abolished the proportional tax system and various exorbitant taxes under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and implemented a full progressive tax system (divided into several levels according to the number of livestock, with higher levels and tax rates for more livestock) that was lighter than in agricultural areas and cities. In 1953, the tax rates and levels of animal husbandry tax were further adjusted, and the tax exemption point was raised, changing the 1952 deduction of 60 sheep per household as the starting point for taxation to an exemption of eight sheep per person per household. At the same time, the 10% local surcharge was abolished. As a result, the enthusiasm of the herdsmen for production was greatly improved. In 1953, the total number of livestock in Xinjiang Province increased by 17.46% compared with 1952, but the total amount of animal husbandry tax decreased by about 60%.
Because of the reduction in animal husbandry tax and the development of production in pastoral areas, the People's Government also conducted publicity among the broad masses of pastoralists regarding the policies of protecting and developing animal husbandry and tax regulations. The pastoralists realized that paying taxes was a duty they should fulfill to the state, and they enthusiastically paid the animal husbandry tax. For example, pastoralists in Cele County in southern Xinjiang prepared for autumn tax payment in the summer of last year, and the entire county completed the tax collection task in 42 days.

    新疆各地牧民踊跃缴纳畜牧业税
    据新华社讯：为了进一步发展畜牧业生产，新疆省一九五三年减轻畜牧业税，各地牧民缴纳牧税极为踊跃。新疆解放后，人民政府取消了国民党反动统治时期的比例税制和各种苛捐杂税，实行轻于农业区和城市的全额累进税收制（根据牲畜数量分为若干等级，牲畜越多其等级也越高，税率也大）。一九五三年又进一步调整了牧税的税率和税级，提高免征点，改变一九五二年每户扣除六十只绵羊起征点为每户每人扣除八只绵羊的免征额，同时取消了百分之十的地方附加。因之，大大提高了牧民的生产热情。一九五三年新疆省牲畜总数比一九五二年增加了百分之十七点四六，可是牧税总额减低了百分之六十左右。
    由于牧税减轻，牧区生产发展，人民政府又向广大牧民进行了保护与发展畜牧业政策和征税条例的宣传，牧民们认识到纳税是对国家应尽的义务，踊跃缴纳了牧税。如南疆策勒县牧民在去年夏季就作了秋季缴税的准备工作，全县在四十二天内就完成了税收任务。
