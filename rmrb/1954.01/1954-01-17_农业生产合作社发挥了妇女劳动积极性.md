Agricultural Production Cooperatives Unleash Women's Enthusiasm for Labor
Creating Conditions for Increased Production
In 1953, 43 agricultural production cooperatives in Sichuan Province had a total of 688 female members participating in production. Before joining the cooperatives, these women rarely participated in agricultural production labor. Hong Meiniang, a female member of the Zhang Sizhou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jianyang County, lacked male labor at home. Before joining the cooperative, she couldn't handle heavy work and there wasn't enough light work. In 1953, she was assigned tasks she could handle within the cooperative, accumulating 140 workdays. Because more women participated in production, the cooperative could free up male labor to do other heavier work. In the Yue Huqing Cooperative in Luxian County, the participation of nine female members allowed male members to plow and harrow the cooperative's paddy fields five times and seven times respectively, and to apply more than 200,000 catties of base fertilizer, creating conditions for increased production. All 28 female members of the Li Kaizhen Production Cooperative in Nanbu County have now learned advanced production techniques such as cotton field management and wheat strip sowing. Many female members have also become the backbone of leadership in the cooperatives. According to statistics from the 43 cooperatives, 52 female members served as leaders or deputy leaders of production teams, 31 served as members of the cooperative's management committee, and eight were elected as cooperative leaders or deputy leaders. After participating in production, many female members increased their household income, greatly improved their status in the family, and improved family relationships as a result.

Women's Labor Accounts for Nearly Half of the Total Labor Force of the Cooperative
The Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, has a total of 134 members, including 64 women. Counting the semi-able-bodied labor, women's labor accounts for 47.7% of the total labor force of the cooperative. These women played a significant role in agricultural production. During the autumn harvest, the vast majority of the cooperative's 150 mu of cotton, 60 mu of cowpeas, 60 mu of mung beans, 15 mu of corn, 12 mu of black beans, and 12 mu of melons were harvested by women. Women actively found ways to resolve the contradiction between housework and participation in agricultural labor. For example, during the first stripping of cotton bolls, which was a production lull, women mobilized to complete the winter clothes within half a month and then fully invested in agricultural production during the busy farming season. The cooperative regularly conducted ideological education for women, insisted on implementing the principle of equal pay for equal work and the contract system. At the same time, it also paid attention to cultivating female backbones, who led all the women in production, which had a very good effect. In production, the cooperative always assigned work that was suitable for women to them as much as possible, based on their characteristics. For example, cotton pest control, thinning, bud trimming, and cotton picking are all suitable for women's labor, so they were taught the techniques in these areas and women were entirely responsible for these tasks, which greatly increased women's interest in participating in production.

Shi Hongmei's Life Became Prosperous
Shi Hongmei, a member of the Yangjiazhuang Agricultural and Forestry Production Cooperative in Pingyi County, Shandong Province, is a widow with two daughters. Before liberation, she farmed four mu of barren mountain land, which she didn't manage well, and ate coarse grains and vegetables all year round, having fled famine and begged for food four times. After liberation, she was allocated land, and with the care of the village and government relief, her life was better than before. Her second daughter went to school, and she and her eldest daughter helped others with odd jobs. However, their lives were still difficult and they still needed government relief until 1952. After the autumn harvest in 1952, the Yangjiazhuang Agricultural and Forestry Production Cooperative was established, and she joined it. Her land and pear trees were all used as shares in the cooperative, and she and her eldest daughter participated in labor. The cooperative used labor in a unified way. She was responsible for feeding three large pigs, receiving a fixed share for one day, and also doing other work, earning three and five points each day. Her eldest daughter, Yang Xinglan, was already 17 years old and could do work as well as a man. She contracted to build stone dams and carry stones in the spring, earning over thirteen points a day. After the autumn harvest, it was calculated that they earned a total of more than 140 workdays, receiving more than 1,500 catties of grain and 50,000 yuan for pears. In addition, they also received several thousand catties of mountain grass and other miscellaneous items. The children all wore new cotton clothes and made new quilts. Shi Hongmei said: "This year's life is very different from before. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership. I will work even harder in the cooperative in the future to repay Chairman Mao's kindness." (Zhang Fulin)

"No One Can Compare to the Female Team Leader"
Bi Zhenrong is the model female production team leader of the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bayan Gaole Nutuk, Zhalantun Banner, Inner Mongolia. She led 37 female members in the cooperative and achieved many successes in production. In the spring of 1953, it did not rain for many days in a row. Although the cooperative decided to dig 13 wells, some members were not enthusiastic about digging wells. At this time, the Party branch called on Party members to take the lead in digging wells. Bi Zhenrong was the first to respond to the Party's call, leading female members to dig a well on the western hillside. This event educated all the members of the cooperative, and everyone was encouraged to complete the plan to dig 13 wells in a very short period, ensuring timely spring sowing. Bi Zhenrong was therefore commended by the district. When the busy farming season arrived, the cooperative management committee called on everyone to temporarily suspend sideline production and prepare to transport manure to the fields. Some members were unwilling and delayed transporting manure for various reasons. At this time, Bi Zhenrong promoted the benefits of early manure transportation to female members, and mobilized the women who were weaving mats to stop weaving, and the girls who were spinning to put down their spinning wheels. Everyone came to transport manure together. Under the influence of the female members, the male members also temporarily stopped selling firewood at the market and turned to transporting manure. Because it was guaranteed that "manure was applied to every mu, and topdressing was applied according to the season," each mu of land yielded an average of more than 3,800 catties of grain after the autumn harvest. Bi Zhenrong's actions were respected by the cooperative and local farmers. Whenever she was mentioned, everyone said: "No one can compare to the female team leader."

A Female Cooperative Leader
Kang Juying was once the leader of the "Provincial Special-Class Model Mutual Aid Group" in Hengshan County, Hunan Province. In March 1953, Kang Juying's mutual aid group was transformed into an agricultural production cooperative, and Kang Juying became the first female cooperative leader in the agricultural production cooperatives of Hunan Province. In the early days of the establishment of the cooperative, there were many confused thoughts among the members. She relied on the Party organization to mobilize Party members to carry out patient persuasion and assistance separately. When encountering difficult farming activities, she took the lead in doing them. When the cooperative was experimenting with transplanting triangular rice (close planting of tillers), a few elderly members strongly opposed it and were unwilling to transplant. Kang Juying and several farmers took the lead in transplanting, and as a result, this field yielded more grain, and those who had originally opposed it later said nothing. During drought resistance and autumn harvest, Kang Juying worked day and night with the cooperative's management committee and Party members to plan and arrange work, doing the most arduous work. After harvesting the rice during the day, she and the accountant kept accounts at night, so that the members could understand the harvest situation of the entire cooperative in a timely manner. Usually, Kang Juying always said: "Running a cooperative must be beneficial to the members in any case, and the members must not suffer losses." She submitted relatively important matters in the cooperative for everyone to discuss, and tried to fulfill everyone's wishes as much as possible. She also knew that to do a good job in production, unity must be strengthened, so she paid great attention to close contact with the members.
Due to the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and due to the hard work of Kang Juying and all the members, the cooperative harvested more than 7,000 catties of grain more in 1953 than in 1952, and the members were all smiles. In December, when the cooperative management committee was re-elected in accordance with the regulations, Kang Juying was once again elected as the cooperative leader by all the members.

"The Cooperative Really Can't Do Without Women's Labor"
Li Guizhi, the original female director of the Yang Xianting Agricultural Production Cooperative in Heilongjiang Province, went to the Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School in the spring of 1953. Liu Shuqin, who came from the fourth grade of elementary school, took over her work. During the spring plowing, she led the women to learn how to drive the harrow and hold the plow. During the summer hoeing, there was a lot of rain and the weeds grew as high as the seedlings in the fields. She mobilized 15 women to thin the millet in the cooperative, and all of them met the requirements for equidistant thinning. At that time, the three and a half mu of soybean land in Xiwazi had half a furrow of water accumulated. The women saw that the soybeans were not harvested, so they topped the rainwater on their heads and stepped on the muddy water with their feet, pulling out the grass one by one. This part of the crops was finally rescued. Li Guizhi's letter to the women in the cooperative from the Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School became propaganda material, which further encouraged the women's enthusiasm for production. After the autumn harvest began, in addition to leading the women to do general odd jobs, Liu Shuqin quickly selected all the millet seeds in the cooperative, and also peeled corn and harvested potatoes with the male members. The women's achievements in production made the male members feel that "the cooperative really can't do without women's labor." Zhou Gui, the deputy director of the cooperative, used to despise women's labor, and the women said that he always had a stern face and everyone was afraid to see him. Last year was different. His attitude changed and he began to value women's labor. Sometimes he even persuaded them not to let them work too hard. Yang Xianting, the director of the cooperative, also said: "It is much easier to get things done by mobilizing women."

    农业生产合作社发挥了妇女劳动积极性
    为增产创造了条件
    一九五三年四川省四十三个农业生产合作社中，共有六百八十八个女社员参加了生产。这些女社员在入社以前，很少参加农业生产劳动。简阳县张泗洲农业生产合作社的女社员宏么娘，家中缺乏男劳动力，入社前她在家是重活没法做，轻活不够做。一九五三年她在社内被分配作能胜任的活，共做了一百四十个劳动日。因为妇女参加生产的多了，合作社就可腾出男劳动力去做好其他较繁重的工作。泸县岳沪清合作社的九个女社员参加劳动，使男社员把全社的水田作到了五犁七耙，并踩下二十多万斤底肥，为增产创造了条件。南部县李开珍生产合作社的二十八个女社员，现在都学会了棉田管理和小麦条播等先进生产技术。有许多女社员还成了社里的领导骨干。据四十三个社的统计，有五十二个女社员作了正、副生产组长，三十一人当了社务委员会的委员，八人被选为正社长或副社长。许多女社员参加生产后，增加了家庭收入，在家庭中的地位大大提高，家庭关系也因此得到改善。
    妇女劳力占全社劳力近一半
    陕西大荔县马廷海农业生产合作社，共有社员一百三十四人，其中妇女六十四人。整半劳力合计起来，妇女劳力占全社劳力的百分之四十七点七。这些妇女在农业生产上发挥了很大的作用。在秋收中，社内一百五十亩棉花，六十亩豇豆，六十亩绿豆和十五亩玉米，十二亩黑豆，十二亩瓜，绝大部分都是妇女收割的。妇女们积极想办法解决家务和参加农业劳动的矛盾，如在棉花第一次脱裤腿时，是一个生产空隙，妇女们全体动员在半个月内赶制好冬季衣服，农忙季节来后，全部投入了农业生产。该社对妇女经常进行思想教育，坚持实行男女同工同酬制和包工制。同时还注意培养妇女骨干，由她们带动全体妇女生产，效果很好。该社生产中总是根据妇女的特点，把适合她们的工作尽量分配给她们。如棉花防虫、间苗、攀芽子、拾花，都适合妇女劳动，就教给她们这方面的技术，完全由妇女负责担任这些工作，这就大大增加了妇女参加生产的兴趣。
    石鸿美的生活富裕了
    山东省平邑县杨家庄农林生产合作社社员石鸿美，是个寡妇，有两个女儿。解放前自己种着四亩山岭薄地，种不好，终年吃糠吃菜，曾四次逃荒要饭。解放后，分了地，依靠村里照顾，政府救济，生活比以前好点，二女儿上了学，她和大女儿帮助别人做点零活。可是她们的生活还是困难，直到一九五二年还得政府救济。一九五二年秋收以后，杨家庄成立了农林生产合作社，她也入了社。她家的地和梨树都作股入到社里，她和大女儿参加了劳动。社里统一使用劳力，她负责喂三口大猪，一天得一个固定分，另外再做些别的活，每天也得个三分五分。她的大女儿杨兴兰已经十七岁，做活能赶上男人，春天包工作石坝子，抬石头，一天得过十三分。秋收后计算，她们共得了一百四十多个工，分到一千五百多斤粮食，五万元的梨钱，另外，还分了几千斤山草以及别的零碎东西。孩子们都穿上了新棉衣，还做了新被子。石鸿美说：“今年的生活和以前比较，真是大不相同了，这都是毛主席领导得好，以后要在社里更好地劳动，报答毛主席的恩情。”　（张福林）
    “谁也比不了女队长”
    毕振荣，是内蒙扎赉特旗巴彦高乐努图克胜利农业生产合作社的模范妇女生产队队长。她带动社内三十七名女社员，在生产上创造了许多成绩。一九五三年春天，一连很多日子没有下雨，社里虽然决定要打十三眼井，可是有一部分社员对打井劲头不足。这时党支部就号召党员带头打井，毕振荣第一个响应了党的号召，带动女社员们，在西山坡地上打出一眼水井来。这件事教育了全社社员，大家鼓起劲在很短时间内就完成了十三眼井的打井计划，保证了春季适时播种。毕振荣因此得到区上的表扬。在农忙季节到来时，社务管理委员会号召大家把副业生产暂时停止，准备往地里送粪，一部分社员不愿意，就拿种种理由推迟送粪。这时，毕振荣一面向女社员宣传早送粪的好处，一面动员编席子的妇女停止了编席，纺线的姑娘们放下纺车，大家一起都来送粪。男社员们在女社员们影响下，也暂时停止了
  “赶集”卖柴，转入了送粪。由于保证了“垧垧上粪，按季追肥”，秋后每垧地平均打粮三千八百多斤。毕振荣的行动，受到社内和当地农民的尊敬，每当提到她，大家都说：“谁也比不了女队长。”
      一个女社长
    康菊英曾经是湖南省衡山县“省特等模范互助组”的组长。一九五三年三月，康菊英互助组转为农业生产合作社，康菊英就当了湖南省农业生产合作社中的第一个女社长。建社的初期，社员当中存在着许多混乱思想，她就依靠党的组织，发动党员分头进行耐心的说服和帮助。遇到困难的农事活动，她就带头去干。社里试插品字形禾（分蔸密植）时，少数年老的社员极力反对，不愿意插。康菊英和几个农民，便带头去插，结果这一丘田多打了粮食，原先反对的人后来也不说话了。抗旱、秋收中，康菊英更是夜以继日地和社务委员、党员共同计划和布置工作，作最艰苦的活，白天打完禾，晚上和会计一道记账，使社员及时了解全社收成情况。平时，康菊英总是说：办合作社无论如何要对社员有利，不能使社员吃亏。社里较为重要的事情她都提交大家讨论，尽可能做到人人心愿。她还知道，要搞好生产，还得搞好团结，所以她很注意密切和社员的联系。
    由于党和人民政府的正确领导，由于康菊英以及全体社员的辛勤劳动，一九五三年合作社比一九五二年多收了七千多斤粮食，社员人人喜笑颜开。十二月，全社照章进行改选社务委员时，康菊英再度被全体社员选为社长。
    “社里离了妇女劳动真不行”
    黑龙江省杨显亭农业生产合作社原来的妇女理事李桂芝，在一九五三年春天上工农速成中学去了，刘淑勤从小学四年级出来，接替了她的工作。在春耕当中，她领导妇女们学赶耲耙，扶拉子；夏锄当中，雨水多，地里草苗齐长，她发动十五名妇女间完了社里的谷子，而且都合等距间苗的要求。那时，西洼子三垧半种大豆的地，积半垄沟子水，妇女们眼看大豆没收成了，就头上顶着雨水，脚下踩着泥水，一把一把地把草薅净了，这部分庄稼终于被抢救出来。李桂芝从工农速成中学写给社里妇女们的信，变成了宣传鼓动的材料，更加鼓舞了妇女们的生产积极性。秋收开始后，刘淑勤除了领导妇女做一般零活外，很快就把全社谷种选出来，并和男社员们一起扒玉米，起土豆。妇女们在生产上的成绩，使男社员们感到“离了妇女劳动真不行”了。该社副主任周贵过去轻视妇女劳动，妇女们说他老板着面孔，谁都怕见他。去年却不同了，他的态度转变了，开始重视妇女们的劳动，有时还劝说她们，不让她们干活太累。社主任杨显亭也说：把妇女发动起来，事情就好办得多了。
