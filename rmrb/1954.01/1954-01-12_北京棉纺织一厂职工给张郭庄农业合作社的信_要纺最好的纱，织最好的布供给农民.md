Letter from Workers of Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill to Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Cooperative
We Must Spin the Best Yarn and Weave the Best Cloth to Supply the Peasants

Comrade Guo Rong, Director of Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative, Fengtai, Beijing:

We were very happy to see the news in the People's Daily that the agricultural production cooperative you lead overcame various disasters last year. Your cooperative sold more than 35,000 catties of surplus grain to the state, and the workers of our factory greatly admire your patriotic actions and extend our greatest respect to you.

Our factory began construction in the first year of the Five-Year Plan. We are now installing machinery and will be officially producing in the second quarter of this year. At that time, we will definitely spin the best yarn and weave the best cloth to supply you.

If we want to live a good life, we must take the socialist road, and only in socialist society can we live a better life. We, the worker-peasant brothers, are one family and are walking the same road. Therefore, we must unite closely and strive to realize the general line of the state.

The entire staff of the State-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill

    北京棉纺织一厂职工给张郭庄农业合作社的信
    要纺最好的纱，织最好的布供给农民
    北京丰台张郭庄农业生产合作社主任郭荣同志：
    我们在人民日报上看到了你所领导的农业生产合作社去年战胜了各种灾害的消息，我们非常高兴。你们合作社把余粮三万五千多斤全都卖给了国家，我厂职工对你们这种爱国主义行动非常敬佩，谨向你们表示最大的敬意。
    我厂是在五年计划的第一年中开始建立的，现在我们正安装机器，今年第二季度就可正式生产，到那时我们一定纺出最好的纱，织出最好的布来，供给你们。
    我们要过好日子，就要走社会主义的道路，也只有到了社会主义社会，才能过更美好的生活。咱们工农兄弟是一家，走的是一条道路。因此，我们要紧紧地团结在一起，为实现国家总路线而奋斗。
            国营北京第一棉纺织厂全体职工
