    Yao Lianjun
    —People Building the Mountainous Areas, Part Two
    Qin Zhaoyang
    Having just crested the mountaintop, this group of people, who didn't believe that barren mountains could be afforested, were immediately stunned. Who wouldn't be amazed? Among the surrounding brown, bare mountains, there was such a large area of ​​dazzling green, lush and dense forest. This forest undulated with the mountain's terrain, with varying shades of color, so clean and so soft, making the blue sky appear even bluer, the white clouds even whiter, and giving life to the surrounding desolate land.
    This is the large forest of Yao Lianjun's agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative, a piece of green earth in the barren mountains.
    People passed through the river beach and arrived at the mouth of the forest mountain valley, only to discover that there was a small village in the mountain hollows inside the forest. At the foot of the village was a winding stream, making metallic-like sounds of flowing water. The people had never seen such clear water, nor had they seen so many cattails and daylilies growing by the water's edge, so they scrambled to bend down, scoop up the water to drink, pick the flowers to look at, smack their lips, and praise it. Walking further up along the stone path by the stream, they saw small canals flowing along the edges of the farmland, and groups of men and women were watering the fields. The wind blew from the depths of the mountain forest, bringing bursts of fresh fragrance with the rustling sound. In the village, the millstone for grinding flour rumbled, and someone's daughter was singing softly…
    Yao Lianjun's home was in a deeper mountain hollow on the west side of the village, a large courtyard with more than a dozen good houses. More than a dozen animals were tied under the persimmon tree in the open space at the entrance of the courtyard. Yao Lianjun was helping the porters load basket after basket of fresh fruit onto the animals' backs with two young cooperative members.
    He was a middle-aged man in his forties, tall, with a bare back that shone black, two strong arms like branches of a tree, and those two big hands, when picking up willow baskets full of peaches and apricots, looked like children playing with toys.
    As soon as he saw the district head leading people, he put down his work, gave a few instructions to the two cooperative members, and then greeted them, grinning widely, grabbing District Chief Wang's arm while speaking loudly as if to people in the distance:
    “Ha! As soon as I received the district head's notice that all the cadres in the district were coming to visit us here, I've been waiting…”
    Old Yao led the people into the courtyard, spread a mat under a large pear tree, poured two baskets of peaches onto the mat, and said:
    “Everyone, try some, these were just picked…”
    While the district head was declining on behalf of everyone, most of the people who came with him had already scattered and gone into the mountains and forests. They loved this mountain and this forest, walking back and forth in the forest, shouting to each other, startling the birds to fly away…
    An hour later, people gathered and sat down on a flat area halfway up the mountain. Yao Lianjun stood like a large tree in the middle of the group, telling his own story.
    What he said was not an ordinary story, but a poem…
                  ×  ×  ×
    “…Peaches are delicious, but trees are hard to plant. But trees are ultimately planted by people. If people don't plant trees, how can there be peaches to eat?
      “This story is a long one.
      “This mountain used to be the property of a landlord. He felt that this mountain was a piece of scrap iron, only costing him money and grain to the government every year and not producing anything. He wanted to give it away for nothing. After three years of trying to 'push' it away, no one wanted it, so my grandfather took it.
      “My grandfather made a living by carrying goods with a shoulder pole. My father worked as a porter and died early. As for me, at that time, I herded sheep for others. Our three generations had never had a table-sized piece of land. We wanted to farm so badly we were going crazy.
    “I asked my grandfather: ‘This mountain doesn't even grow grass well, what do we want it for!’
    “He said: ‘If it doesn't grow grass, we'll make it grow trees.’
    “I said: ‘How are you going to make it grow trees?’
      “He said: ‘Do you see that tree on the mountaintop over there? Can you guess how that tree grew? It grew on a rock! It cracked the rock with its roots, and there was soil in the cracks, so it took root. We are people, can't we take root on a rock?’
    “So we started taking root on the rocks of this barren mountain.
    “At that time, there were only three to five families in this mountain hollow, planting a few acres of sandy slope. We built a thatched shed in the gully a mile away from them and also cleared a little sandy slope, and started planting the land and planting trees at the same time.
    “Don't look down on the barren mountain. There is soil on these rocky areas, and where there is soil, trees can be planted. My grandfather and I looked for places with soil, planted seeds, planted seedlings. After two years, we planted a large area. Some of the seedlings grew, and some died. If they died, we replanted. If they died again, we still replanted. After four years, ha! The mountain changed color!
    “Guess what? In the fifth year, it rained heavily for three days and two nights, like the sky was falling. My grandfather and I, soaked in the rain, walked around the mountain day and night. A bare mountain can't hold water. The water scraped away the soil, the seedlings exposed their roots, fell over, and were washed away.
      “When the rain stopped and we looked: not a single one was left!
      “Cry! Howl at the heavens!
    “Grandfather howled until he fainted. I carried him into the thatched shed. He lay on the kang, moaning for nine days, and then died.
      “Before he died, he said to me: ‘Child, our family has had no home, no property, no roots, no anchor for three generations. We still must, absolutely, take root, on this barren mountain…’
    “I thought: I've become a seedling in the heavy rain! I can't survive!
      “Die? Why could that tree on the mountaintop take root on the rock? Can't people make a living on a barren mountain?
      “I couldn't sleep day or night. Whether I had something to do or not, I squatted on this barren mountain, looking around in all directions, thinking.
      “One day, I saw a wild jujube tree next to me, and I asked it: ‘Jujube, jujube, how did you take root?’ I looked and saw that there was a small flat area at the foot of the tree, with very thick, damp soil. The edge of the flat area was blocked by scattered stones.
      “Oh, I understand: build a flat area with stones, and then plant trees on the flat area. Not only will it not be washed away, but it can also conserve water and soil.
      “I jumped up, saying in my heart: ‘Grandfather, you died too early. If you had died a month later, you wouldn't have died!’
    “I started all over again: sowing seeds, planting seedlings, moving stones, building flat areas. Plant birch trees, Chinese toon trees, and jujube trees in high places, and fruit trees in low places. Regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, unafraid of the coldest winter months, I don’t know how many stones on this mountain have been crushed by these two feet of mine.
    “Look at this hand of mine, is this a hand? Extend your hands and compare them. Yours are the hands of farmers, mine, it’s like old tree roots, right?
    “With these two old tree root hands, a large area of ​​barren mountain has changed color again!
    “Yao Lianjun has become less like a human. I am as black and thin as a monkey, wearing two pieces of tattered sheepskin all year round, winter and summer. I have become the soul of the mountain, the ghost in the trees. I never leave the mountain day or night.
    “When it's dry, I carry water from a long distance down the mountain to water the trees; when there is too much rain, I am afraid that the grass will grow over the seedlings, so I dig the grass. When shepherds or woodcutters pass by the mountain, I stare at them without moving my eyes.
    “When I dream at night, I also dream of this mountain covered in green.
      “In 1927 [Republic of China year 16], the rain that fell flooded the foot of the mountain, and chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, firewood, and trees were swept away in a yellow mud soup. In that river valley you just passed, several villages along the river were washed away, tens of thousands of trees washed away.
      “As soon as the rain stopped and the water receded, people from several villages came to see Yao Lianjun's mountain. Ha! Here, not a single seedling was lost, and even the topsoil on the mountain was intact. The stream below the mountain, even though it had just rained heavily, the water was clear.
      “People said: ‘Yao Lianjun is a land immortal, managing the mountain and the water.’
      “I am not some heavenly immortal or land immortal, I am a person!
      “From three or four years after planting the trees, I have benefited. There are a few sayings that I made up myself: peaches take three years, apricots four years, pears five years, walnuts and persimmons six or seven years, oak trees can feed silkworms in seven years, and jujube can make money in the same year. In less than ten years, all my trees have become materials and are bearing fruit. I don’t have to worry about eating or burning!
      “Yao Lianjun has taken root on the rocks!
      “Yao Lianjun has turned scrap iron into gold!
      “But am I really not worried? Have I really taken root?
      “Not yet, not yet.
    “Guess why? If only I, Yao Lianjun, am doing well, and the people around are still poor, in the cold weather, they will cut my trees to burn as firewood; in the hot weather, they will pick my fruits to exchange for grain. I only have these two eyes and two hands, can I keep watch? Can I take care of it?
    “When the fruit is about to ripen, I stay on the mountain, not sleeping all night. In winter, no matter how cold it is, I always have to go to the mountain twice in the middle of the night.
      “Alas! I can't finish talking about the anger I felt in three days.
    “In 1943, the Anti-Japanese government launched the 'Great Production Movement' and advocated 'organizing,' and after listening to the report from the higher-ups, I suddenly understood: why don't I have everyone plant trees? If everyone takes root, the roots will be firm!
      “At that time, I thought: look, that tree on the mountaintop from before withered a few years ago, and then was broken by a strong wind. Why? A single tree cannot make a forest!
      “At that time, our village had already developed into a dozen households. I joined their mutual aid group and taught them how to plant trees, how to build flat areas, and how to conserve water and soil. I helped them plant trees without asking them to return the labor.
      “Now, you see, all the trees in our village have become materials and are bearing fruit. The whole village is doing well.
      “In our whole village, the green on the mountains is expanding year by year, the number of livestock and sheep is increasing year by year, the soil is becoming more fertile year by year, and even the water is becoming clearer year by year, and people's faces are becoming redder year by year.
      “Our whole village has taken root!
      “Am I, Yao Lianjun, happy? Am I relieved?
      “Not yet, not yet.
      “Why?
      “Because not all of our poor brothers and sisters in the mountainous areas have forests like mine, and they are still living in poverty.
      “District Chief Wang taught me this principle.
      “This spring, District Chief Wang came to me and talked to me all night.
      “He asked me: ‘In the early years, didn't you always make trouble for the fruit merchants?’
      “Why not? Those bad guys always lowered the price. If we don't sell? The fruit is liable to spoil if kept, if we sell, it's not worthwhile.
    “He also asked: ‘After liberation, roads for cars were built in the mountains, and the county cooperative collected mountain goods, so it's much better, right?’
      “Why isn't it much better? The prices are fair, there is no need to argue, there is no need to rush.
    “He said: ‘Old Yao, it would be great if the entire mountainous area became like your village. At that time, the government will not only build roads for us, but also build railways for us, and transport the timber and fruits from our entire mountainous area to the whole country!’
   “Ha! These words encouraged my heart!
      “Think about it, how great that kind of society would be!
    “At that time, the more he spoke, the happier he became, and the more I listened, the more energetic I became. Neither of us could sleep, so we got up and went for a walk outside. The moon was so big, the sky was as clear as water, and the mountains and trees around could be seen clearly.
      “District Chief Wang walked, swung his hand, and said: ‘Old Yao, you know what? Some scientists in England and the United States say that the mountains in North China are getting old, and in the future, the whole of North China will become a barren sandy land. But look, we can plant trees on barren mountains, we can make these mountains rejuvenate, ha!’
      “I was angry in my heart, and said: ‘What kind of fart scientists are these? Can mountains get old? Can the land get old?’
      “He said loudly: ‘Of course not! As long as people's hearts are not old, anything can be done!’
      “We were talking like this, and my feet felt like I was riding on clouds, circling four or five mountain peaks, and I didn’t feel sleepy or tired. Looking back, the east was getting light!
      “Hey, that night, I really felt like I was dreaming! No, no, it's not dreaming, it's waking up. It's like sleeping for decades and waking up all of a sudden!
      “District Chief Wang stayed in our village for ten days and helped our five natural villages establish an agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry cooperative.
      “Ha! Only now have the people in our entire mountainous area truly taken root! This is taking root in socialism, it is to make our mountainous area full of green leaves and blooming peach and pear blossoms! It is to make our mountains grow logging factories, grow railways, grow ways to use airplanes to kill insects, and grow large reservoirs!
      “For this, we must work!
      “Our cooperative has only been established for a short time, and there is already a craze for afforestation.
    “Every day, as soon as the rooster crows, I get up, stand on the highest mountain behind our village, and beat the wake-up gong at four o'clock. The women in the five natural villages are busy holding firewood and cooking. The men put tree seeds in their pockets and prepared the saddles for the animals. Then, I beat the breakfast gong at five o'clock and the assembly gong at six o'clock. Look: groups of adults and children, men and women gathered, lined up like lines and set off, climbing up the mountain slopes. One group of people on this mountain slope sings songs; another group of people on that mountain slope sings songs. Men dig pits, women and children scatter seeds, build flat areas…
    “You all are the same as me, leaders of the masses, cooperative chairmen, group leaders, township heads, branch secretaries. You all think about it: can we completely afforest our mountainous area?
    “Can we make this entire mountainous area greener year by year, the water clearer year by year, the soil better year by year, and people's faces redder year by year?
    “Can we make our mountainous area embark on the path of socialism?
      “According to me, Yao Lianjun, we can!
      “We have hands and hearts, so we can!”
                  ×  ×  ×
    The more Yao Lianjun spoke, the more excited he became. His face and neck turned purplish-red. His voice was so loud and resounding that the surrounding mountains echoed in resounding cheers, as if the mountains and fields were cheering in unison:
      “We have hands and hearts, so we can!”
    This echo awakened the people who were mesmerized by the speech. Looking around in all directions: the surrounding forests were being stirred up by a gust of cool wind, a group of birds flew up from the forests on this side of the mountain, like countless black dots, circled in the azure sky for a while, and then landed on the other side of the mountain... Below, the village was unusually quiet, and the people who had been busy all day were taking a midday rest. At the entrance of Yao Lianjun's courtyard, the people and animals transporting fruit had already left, and several hens were leisurely searching for insects in the shade of the trees. There were two children, leaning against the courtyard door from a distance. The boy was all black, almost a small tree; the girl was even more beautiful than fresh flowers. They both held bowl-sized peaches in their hands, eating while looking up at the mountain from time to time, their faces flashing with smiles.
    Young people and children, why are you smiling? Is it because the peaches taste fragrant and sweet?

    姚连君
    ——建设山区的人们之二
    秦兆阳
    刚刚翻过山顶，这群不相信荒山可以造林的人们立时都目瞪口呆了。谁不惊奇呢？在四面褐色的光秃秃的荒山当中，竟有这么一大片绿得耀眼的、葱笼茂密的树林。这林子随着山势起伏，颜色深浅间杂，是那么洁净，那么柔和，使得蓝天显得更蓝，白云显得更白，使得周围荒凉的大地也有了生气。
    这就是姚连君的农林牧生产合作社的大树林，这片树林，是荒山当中的一块绿土。
    人们经过河滩，走到林山的谷口上，才发现树林里面的山凹凹里有个小小的村庄，村庄脚下有一道曲折的溪流，发出金属般的流水声。人们没有看见过这样清澈的水，也没有看见过水边丛生着这么多的苍蒲和金针花，就争着弯下腰去，捧起水来喝，摘下花来看，啧着嘴唇，赞叹着。沿着溪边的石头小路再往上走，就看见一条条的小渠道沿着庄稼地边流了过去，三三五五的男女正在地里浇地。风从山林深处吹来，随着哗哗的响声，送来一阵阵清新的香味。村庄里，碾面的碾盘隆隆地响，谁家的姑娘在细声细气地唱着歌儿……
    姚连君的家，在村西更深的山凹里边，是一个十几间好房子的大院落。院子门口空场上的柿子树下边拴着十几匹牲口，姚连君正和两个青年社员帮着脚夫们把一篓篓的鲜果往牲口背上驮。
    他是个四十来岁的中年人，高高的个儿，光着黑得放光的脊梁，两只强壮的胳膊像两枝树桠杈，那两只大手提起装满了桃儿杏儿的柳条篓子来，真像小孩们拿玩具一样。
    他一看见区长带着人们来了，就放下活儿，对两个社员安排了几句什么，然后向这边迎上来，裂着大嘴笑着，一边抓住王区长的胳膊，一边像对远处的人说话似的，大声叫起来：
    “哈！一接到区长的通知，知道全区的干部们要上咱这儿来参观，我就等着……”
    老姚把人们领进院里，在一棵大梨树下边铺了张席，把两筐子桃儿倒在席上，说道：
    “大伙儿尝尝，这是刚刚摘下来的……”
    当区长正代表着大家跟他推让着的时候，同来的人们却已经大部分走散了，都钻到山上林子里去了。他们爱这山，爱这树林，在林子里穿来穿去，互相嚷叫着，把鸟儿都惊得飞了起来……
    一个钟头以后，人们才在半山的一块平地上围坐下来，姚连君像棵大树似的站在人圈当中，讲起他自己的故事来了。
    他所说的不是一篇普通的故事，而是一首诗……
                  ×  ×  ×
    “……桃儿好吃树难栽，可树到底是人栽的，人要是没栽成树，咋的有桃儿吃哩？
      “这事儿说起来话长。
      “这片山原是地主的产业，他觉着这山是块废铁，每年光给官府拿钱粮，不出产东西，要白‘推’出去，‘推’了三年没人要，我爷爷就要上了。
      “我爷爷是靠担扁担给人运货吃饭的。我爹给人扛活，死得早。我哩，那时给人放羊。俺们祖孙三辈没价桌子大块地，想地种想的要发疯。
    “我问爷爷：‘这山连草都长不旺，咱要它干吗呀！’
    “他说：‘它不长草，咱要叫它长树。’
    “我说：‘你咋的叫它长树哩？’
      “他说：‘你看见那边山脑脑上那棵树没有？你猜那棵树是咋长的？它长在石头上！它用根根把石头挣裂了，石头缝儿里有土，它就长住了。咱是个人，就不能在石头上扎根儿吗？’
    “咱就起始往这荒山的石头上扎根儿了。
    “那工夫，这山凹凹里只有三五家人家，种着几亩沙坡地。俺们就在离他们一里地的沟沟里盖了个草棚棚，也开了一点沙坡地，就起始一边种地，一边栽树。
    “你们别看荒山，这麻麻石头上也有土，有土就能栽树。我跟爷爷找那有土的地方，种上籽儿，栽上苗儿，二年工夫，栽了好大一片，有成了苗儿的，有死了的。死了，咱就补种，补了又死，死了还补。四年工夫了，哈！山，变了颜色啦！
    “你猜咋哩？第五年头上，下了三天两宿大雨，像塌了天。我跟我爷爷淋着雨，日夜在山上转。光山存不住水，水刮着土，树苗儿露出了根儿，倒了，冲走了。
      “等雨停了一看：一棵也不剩！
      “哭吧！对着老天爷嚎叫吧！
    “爷爷嚎昏了，我把他背进草棚里，躺在炕上哼哼了九天，就死了。
      “临断气，他对我说：‘孩孩，咱家三辈没家没业，没根没绊，咱还是，一定、要在这荒山上、扎根……’
    “我心想：我这可成了大雨里边的树苗儿啦！活不了啦！
      “死吗？咋的那山脑脑上那棵树，在石头上扎上根儿了哩？人就不能在荒山上讨活命吗？
      “我日夜睡不着，有事没事的就往这荒山上蹲着，往四面瞅着，寻思着。
      “有一天，我看见身子边边上有棵野酸枣树儿，我就问它：‘酸枣酸枣，你是咋的扎上根儿的哩？’我一看，它那树脚下是块小坪坪，有很厚的潮黏黏的土，坪坪边上，是给乱石头拦着的。
      “哦，我明白啦：用石头垒成坪坪，坪坪上再栽上树，不光冲不走，还能保水保土。
      “我一下跳起来了，心里说：‘爷爷，你死得太早啦，晚一个月，你就死不了啦！’
    “我又从头儿干起：下籽儿，栽苗儿，搬石头，垒坪儿。高的地方栽桦树、椿树、枣树，低的地方栽果木树。不分春夏秋冬，不怕十冬腊月，我这两只脚，也不知道把这山上的石头踩碎了多少。
    “你们看我这手，这是手吗？伸出你们那手来比比看，你们那是庄稼人的手，我这，像是老树根根吧？
    “就凭这两只老树根根手，一大片荒山又变了色儿啦！
    “我姚连君可变得不像人哩。我黑瘦得像猴儿，不分冬夏身上搭着两块破羊皮。我变成了山上的魂，树里的鬼。我日夜不离山。
    “天旱了，我从山下老远的地方担水浇树；雨水太多了，我怕草儿长得盖过了树苗儿，就刨草。有放羊打柴的往山下过，我就两眼不动地盯住他。
    “我夜里做梦，也梦见这山上一片绿。
      “民国十六年，下的那雨呀，山脚下流成了河，鸡猪牛羊，柴草树木，在一片黄泥汤子里卷着走。就你们刚刚走过的那道川里，沿川八九个村，冲走了几万棵树。
      “雨一停水一退，几个村的人们都来看咱姚连君的山。咱这里，哈！树苗儿一棵没少，连山上的土皮儿都是原样儿的；山下那条溪，虽说是刚下过大雨，水也是清的。
      “人们说：‘姚连君是地仙，管山管水。’
      “我不是屁的天仙地仙，我是人！
      “从栽了树三四年起，我就得益。有这么几句俗话，是我自个编的：桃三杏四梨五年，核桃柿子六七年，橡树七年能喂蚕，酸枣当年能卖钱。不到十年的工夫，我的树全成了材料啦，全结果子啦，吃的烧的都不愁啦！
      “我姚连君在石头上扎上根儿啦！
      “我姚连君把废铁变成金子啦！
      “可是，我真的不发愁了吗？真的扎上根儿了吗？
      “还不哩，还没有哩。
    “你猜咋的？光我姚连君好过了，四边的人都挺穷，冷天，他们砍我的树当柴烧；热天，他们摘我的果子去换粮食。我就这么两只眼睛两只手，看得牢吗？顾得住吗？
    “一到果子快熟了的时候，我就守在山上，整夜不睡觉。冬天，不管多冷，半夜里我总要到山上去转两趟。
      “唉！我生的那气，真是三天也说不完。
    “一九四三年，抗日政府发动‘大生产运动’，提倡‘组织起来’，我听了上级的报告，猛一下明白了：我为啥不叫大伙儿都栽树哩？大伙儿都扎根，根儿才扎得牢哇！
      “当时我想：你看，从前那山脑脑上那棵树，在几年以前就枯了，后来又给大风刮折了，为啥呢？独木不成林呀！
      “那时咱村已经发展成十几户人家了。我就参加了他们的互助组，教给他们：咋的栽树，咋的垒坪，咋的保水保土。我帮他们栽树，不叫他们还工。
      “到如今，你们看，咱全村的树都成材料啦，结果子啦，全村都好过啦。
      “咱全村，山上的绿色一年比一年扩大，牲口羊群一年比一年多，地土也一年比一年肥，连水也
  一年比一年更清亮，人们的脸也一年比一年红。
      “咱全村都扎上根儿啦！
      “我姚连君痛快了吗？松心了吗？
      “不哩，还没有哩。
      “为啥哩？
      “就为的这：俺们全山区的穷苦兄弟还不是都有我这样的树林子，还都在过穷苦日月哩。
      “这个道理还是王区长教给我的。
      “今年春天，王区长找我来了，跟我说了一宿话。
      “他问我：‘早些年，你们是不是尽跟贩果子的商人捣麻烦？’
      “咋不是？那坏蛋们尽压低价钱，不卖？果子搁着爱坏；卖？不合算。
    “他又问：‘解放以后，山里修上汽车路了，县合作社收山货了，就好多了吧？’
      “咋不是好多了？价钱公道啦，不用争吵啦，不用着急啦。
    “他又说：‘老姚啊，要是咱整个山区都变成你这村这样儿，那就好了。那时候，政府不光要给咱修汽车路，还要给咱修火车路哩，要把咱这全山区的木材水果运到全国去哩！’
   “哈呀！他这几句话可鼓起我的心劲儿来啦！
      “你想，那样的社会是多好哇！
    “当时，他越说越高兴，我越听越精神，俺俩都睡不着了，就起来到外边蹓跶。好大的月亮，天上像水一样清亮，四外的山呀树呀看的清清楚楚。
      “王区长走着，把手一甩，说：‘老姚，你知道吧？英国美国的什么科学家，说咱华北的山到了老年时候了，往后全华北都得变成一片荒沙地。可是，你看，咱能在荒山上栽树，咱能叫这山返老还童，哈！’
      “我心里生气，说：‘这是什么屁科学家？山还会老吗？地还会老吗？’
      “他大声说：‘可不是！只要人心不老，什么事也办得到！’
      “俺俩就这么说着，我脚底下像驾着云彩似的，绕了四五个山头，也不觉困，也不觉累，回头一看：东边天亮啦！
      “咳，这一夜，我真像做梦一样！不对，不对，不是做梦，是醒啦，是睡了几十年觉，一下子醒啦！
      “王区长在俺们村住了十天，帮俺们五个自然村成立了一个农林牧合作社。
      “哈！俺们全山区的人，这才叫扎根儿呢！这是扎社会主义的根，是要让咱这山区长满了绿叶，开遍了桃花梨花！是要让咱这山上长出伐木工厂来，长出铁路来，长出用飞机灭虫的办法来，长出大水库来！
      “为了这，咱们要干！
      “俺们的社刚成立不久，就闹起了造林热潮。
    “每天鸡刚叫我就起来，站在咱村后边顶高的那山头上，四点钟打起床锣，五个自然村的女人们就忙着抱柴做饭，男人们把树籽儿装在口袋里，给牲口备好了驮鞍。接着，我五点钟打吃饭锣，六点打集合锣。你瞧吧：一群群大人小孩男男女女集合了，排成一条条的线儿似的出发了，爬到山坡上去了。这个山坡上一群人，唱着歌儿；那个山坡上一群人，唱着歌儿。男人刨坑儿，女人孩子撒籽儿，垒坪儿……
    “你们大伙儿也跟我一样，是群众的领导人，是社长，组长，乡长，支部书记。你们大伙儿想一想：咱能不能把咱这山区完全造上林呢？
    “咱能不能叫咱这整个山区，山一年比一年绿，水一年比一年清，地土一年比一年好，人的脸面一年比一年红呢？
    “咱能不能叫咱这山区走上社会主义的道儿呢？
      “要依我姚连君说，就是能！
      “咱有手有心，就能！”
                  ×  ×  ×
    姚连君越说越兴奋，脸和脖子都变成了紫红色，声音是那么高大洪亮，使得四面的群山都发出了一阵阵响彻云霄的回声，像是山野在同声欢呼：
      “咱有手有心，就能！”
    这回声把听演说听入了迷的人们惊醒了，向四面一看：周围的树林正被凉风掀起了一阵喧哗，一群鸟儿从这边山头上的林子里一轰而起，像无数黑点子似的，在青碧万里的高空上盘旋了一阵，又落到那边山头上去了……下边，村庄异常寂静，忙碌了半天的人们正在歇晌。在姚连君家的院子门口，运果子的人和牲口都已经走了，几只母鸡安闲地在树荫里寻虫子吃。有两个孩子，远远地靠在院子门边。那男孩全身漆黑，简直是一棵小树；那姑娘却比鲜花还要鲜艳。他俩手里都拿着碗大的桃儿，一边吃着，不时往山上瞅瞅，脸上闪耀着微笑。
    青年人和孩子们哪，你为什么笑？是因为那桃儿的味儿又香又甜吗？
