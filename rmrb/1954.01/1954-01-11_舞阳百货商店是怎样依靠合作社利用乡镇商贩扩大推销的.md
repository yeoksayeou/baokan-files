How Wuyang Department Store Relies on Cooperatives and Utilizes Township Merchants to Expand Sales
    Wang Shutian
    Wuyang County Department Store of the China General Merchandise Company, due to its close reliance on cooperatives and the correct utilization of township merchants, has seen its sales increase month by month since June of last year, exceeding its sales targets every month. At the same time, the proportion of goods supplied to consumers through cooperatives has also been rising month by month.
    1. How to Maintain Good Relations with Cooperatives
    Before March of the year before last, the relationship between Wuyang Department Store and the cooperatives was not good. Later, the comrades in the store recognized the importance of relying on cooperatives and took the initiative to help them develop their business.
        Helping Cooperatives Improve Their Operations
    In April of the year before last, the Bohe Cooperative blindly stocked up on goods, wanting to buy thirty dozen fountain pens from the store at once. According to the cooperative's sales volume, this was enough to sell for ten months. At the time, although the store's wholesale department noticed this problem, it allocated the entire amount to the cooperative in order to complete the sales plan, which made it difficult for the cooperative to turn over its capital. When Zhang Zhong, the manager of the store, discovered this, he summoned the wholesale department's salesperson, as well as the director and purchaser of the cooperative, and analyzed and criticized this problem. The store's salesperson made a self-criticism, and the wholesale department accepted the return of twenty-seven dozen fountain pens from the cooperative.
    Last June, when the store launched the Red Flag competition campaign, it put forward the slogan of "Treating the cooperative as its own retail department." The store invited cooperative directors and salespersons to visit the warehouse and the commodity exhibition. Some staff members even took "commodity catalogs" to the cooperatives to promote the products, helping the cooperatives to understand the situation in all aspects. Problems were identified in the course of these connections, and business improvements were studied and implemented in a timely manner. For example, the Wucheng Cooperative had a backlog of first-grade standard cloth that did not meet local needs. The salesperson was worried about not being able to sell it, the purchaser had been criticized for blindly stocking up, and the director was also anxious about the long-term backlog of capital. Seeing that the quality of the standard cloth was good, Yang Changdong estimated that it could be sold in the county town, so he contacted the cooperative, brought the batch of cloth back to the county town, and sold it all on behalf of the cooperative. Through these efforts, the relationship between the store and the cooperatives gradually became closer, and the cooperatives were closely united around the store.
        From Delivering Goods to the Countryside to Signing Contracts
    The store organized personnel to go to the countryside in a planned way, contacting cooperatives and delivering goods to their doors, changing the situation from customers looking for goods to goods looking for customers. Wuyang Department Store implemented a specialized contact sales method of "contracting areas, contracting objects, and contracting tasks." They divided into groups and individuals, each responsible for several cooperatives in a region, gaining an in-depth understanding of the needs of the cooperatives and providing concrete help to their businesses, and taking responsibility for certain sales targets. This allowed salespeople to keep abreast of the store's inventory of commodity specifications, quality, and prices based on the cooperatives' sales situation, and to urge the cooperatives to purchase goods. For example, after practical assistance, the three cooperatives under the responsibility of Zhang Shunxiang, a sales expert, purchased five times more goods from the store in October of last year than in August. Facts have proved that state-owned commercial departments can only complete their sales plans and meet the needs of the broad masses of the people by gaining an in-depth understanding of the needs of the cooperatives and helping them to develop their businesses.
    In addition, Wuyang Department Store also established regular communication with the cooperatives, notifying them first when new goods arrived.
    Due to the close connection between Wuyang Department Store and the cooperatives, it has successively signed supply contracts and sales agreements with the county cooperative federation and 22 grassroots cooperatives in the supply area. In this way, the cooperatives submit their demand plans on time, and the department store supplies goods in a timely manner according to the plans. The department store gives priority to supplying the cooperatives with insufficient commodities. Since October of last year, the total value of goods purchased by cooperatives from the store has increased by 190% compared with July, gradually achieving planned supply.
    2. Correctly Utilizing Legitimate Private Merchants in Townships
        Expanding Commodity Sales
    In addition to closely cooperating with cooperatives, Wuyang Department Store also correctly utilizes private merchants in townships who can obey the leadership of state-owned commerce. As of now, it has signed contracts or established fixed business relationships with 417 urban private merchants, and has signed supply contracts with 93 out of more than 300 rural peddlers, creating conditions for gradually moving towards planned supply.
        Increasing Variety and Meeting the Needs of the Masses
    In organizing and utilizing private merchants to purchase goods locally, Wuyang Department Store gives full play to the initiative and creativity of its salespersons, gaining an in-depth understanding of the market situation, identifying the needs of the masses, and relying on local Party and government organizations to manage the general merchandise industry, using various forms of symposiums to understand the reasons why private merchants do not purchase goods locally. After this series of thorough work, the enthusiasm of private merchants for purchasing goods locally has been enhanced. In order to solve the problem of incomplete variety, the staff created a "three registration" work method through their efforts: first, registering shortages to urge the organization to purchase goods; second, registering customers to arrange the order of customers; and third, registering customers' opinions to improve business. As a result, the variety has been increased, thereby winning over private merchants to purchase goods locally.
        Winning Over Private Merchants to Purchase Goods Locally Through Detailed Accounting
    The staff also created a "four accounting" method, actively persuading private merchants of the benefits of purchasing goods locally by accounting for prices, capital turnover, labor efficiency, and time. For example, cloth merchants in Chushan Town used to organize joint purchase groups to purchase goods from Zhengzhou. At the beginning of the contact, the private merchants felt that the store's prices were too high and not worthwhile. The salesperson patiently gave them a detailed account. Taking Shuiyue blue cloth as an example, the price in Zhengzhou was 436,000 yuan per bolt. The price at Wuyang Department Store was 9,000 yuan higher than in Zhengzhou, but adding the time it takes for transportation back and forth, plus the fact that one person goes to buy it and then everyone shares it, which cannot meet the requirements of variety, it is not more cost-effective than purchasing goods at the local store. Through this detailed accounting, it was explained that purchasing goods from other places involves high costs, long time, and slow capital turnover, resulting in less business and less money, making private merchants realize the benefits of purchasing goods locally. Therefore, private merchants were won over to purchase goods from the department store in a planned way under the leadership of state-owned commerce, expanding commodity sales.

    舞阳百货商店是怎样依靠合作社利用乡镇商贩扩大推销的
    王书田
    中国百货公司舞阳县百货商店由于紧密地依靠合作社和正确地利用乡镇商贩，从去年六月份起，销售额逐月增加，月月超额完成销售任务。同时通过合作社供应消费者的比重也逐月上升。
    一、怎样和合作社搞好关系的
    前年三月以前，舞阳百货商店和合作社关系不好。后来，商店的同志认识了依靠合作社的重要性，就主动地帮助合作社开展业务。
        帮助合作社改进业务
    前年四月间，伯和合作社盲目进货，一次要从商店买进三十打钢笔，按照合作社的销量，足够销售十个月，当时商店批发部虽然发觉了这个问题，但为了完成销售计划，便一次拨给了合作社，这样，就使该社资金周转困难。这事被商店的张忠经理发现，就把批发部的推销员和合作社主任、采购员召集在一起，对这一问题进行了分析批判。商店推销员进行了检讨，批发部接受了合作社二十七打钢笔的退货。
    去年六月，商店在开展红旗竞赛运动时提出“把合作社当成自己的门市部”的口号，商店邀请合作社主任、营业员参观仓库，商品展览会，有些工作人员并带“商品目录”到合作社宣传，帮助合作社从各方面了解情况。在联系中发现问题，及时帮助研究改进业务。如吴城合作社积压一等标准布不合当地需要，营业员正发愁销不出去，采购员因盲目进货受到了批评，主任因长期积压资金也很着急。杨长栋看到标准布的质量不错，估计在县城能销，就和合作社联系，把这批布带回县城，全部替合作社推销了出去。通过这些帮助，商店和合作社的关系逐渐密切起来，合作社都紧紧地团结在商店的周围。
        从下乡送货到签订合同
    有计划地组织人员下乡，联系合作社并送货上门，变顾主找货为货找顾主。舞阳百货商店实行了“包地区、包对象、包任务”的专人专责联系推销法。他们分小组和个人各负责一个地区的几个合作社，深入了解合作社的需要和具体帮助业务，并负责一定的推销任务。这样就可使推销员能根据合作社销售的情况，及时地介绍商店库存商品规格、质量、价格，并督促合作社进货。如推销能手张顺乡负责的三个合作社，经过实际帮助后，去年十月份向商店的进货，比八月份就增加了五倍。事实证明：国营商业部门只有深入了解合作社的需要，帮助合作社开展业务，才能完成推销计划，满足广大人民的需要。
    此外，舞阳百货商店还和合作社建立了经常的通信联系，新货到了便先通知合作社。
    由于舞阳百货商店和合作社的密切联系，先后和县合作总社及供应区内二十二个基层合作社订立了供应合同和供销协议。这样，合作社按时提出要货计划，百货商店按计划及时供应。百货商店对不足的商品就尽先供应合作社。自去年十月起，合作社向商店进货的总值比七月份增加了百分之一百九十，逐步地作到有计划的供应。
    二、正确地利用乡镇正当私商
        扩大了商品推销
    舞阳百货商店除了紧密地和合作社配合外，还正确地利用乡镇中能服从国营商业领导的私人商贩。截至目前，已和四百一十七户城镇私人商贩订立了合同或建立了固定业务关系，在乡村小贩三百余户中和九十三户订立了供应合同，给逐步走上有计划的供应创造了条件。
        增加花色品种满足群众需要
    在组织利用私商就地进货上，舞阳百货商店充分地发挥推销员的主动性和创造性，深入市场了解情况，摸清群众需要，并依靠当地党、政组织经营百货的行业，用各种不同形式的座谈会，了解私商不向当地进货的原因。经过这一系列的周密工作后，提高了私商就地进货的积极性。商店为解决花色、品种不全的问题，在职工们的努力下创造了“三登记”工作法：一、是登记缺货，以督促组织进货；二、是登记顾主，排好顾客次序；三、是登记顾主反映的意见，以改进业务。因此增加了花色品种，从而争取了私商就地进货。
        通过算细账争取私商就地进货
    职工们还创造了“四算账”的办法，从算价格、算资金周转、算劳动效率、算时间中，主动地说服了私人商贩就地进货的好处。如出山镇布商以往是组织联购小组由郑州进货的，开始联系时私商嫌商店价格高不合算，推销员就耐心地对他们算细账，就拿水月蓝布说吧，郑州牌价每匹四十三万六千元，舞阳百货商店在价格上比郑州高九千元，但加上费用往返需要的时间，再加上一人去买来大家分总不能满足花色品种的要求，并不比在当地商店进货合算。通过这样算细账，说明外地进货费用大、时间长、资金周转慢，少做生意少卖钱，使私商认识到就地进货的好处，因此争取了私营商贩在国营商业的领导下，有计划地向百货商店进货，扩大了商品推销。
