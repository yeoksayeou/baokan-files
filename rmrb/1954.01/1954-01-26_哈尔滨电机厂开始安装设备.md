    Harbin Electric Machinery Plant Begins Installing Equipment
    The equipment installation project of the state-owned Harbin Electric Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the first large-scale electric motor manufacturing plant built in China last year, has begun construction. The new-style machinery and equipment to be installed in the plant come from the socialist country of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Germany and other people's democratic countries, and some are manufactured in our own country. At present, installation design drawings and mechanical equipment are arriving one after another, most of the various building materials have entered the site, the quarterly installation project plan for the whole year has been determined, and the foundation project for equipment installation started on January 16.
    In order to ensure the completion of the construction project of the large-scale electric motor manufacturing plant, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized an inspection team as early as early December last year to inspect and urge the preparation work for construction at the plant. On the 11th of this month, the Municipal Committee held a special meeting of leading cadres from the plant, construction units, and relevant municipal units to inspect the construction preparation work of the plant, and promptly criticized the leading ideology of the plant and construction units, which emphasized civil engineering construction over installation, production over production preparation, and certain blind complacency. It pointed out that a focus must be established in the construction work, and the leadership of equipment installation projects, civil engineering construction projects, and production preparation work must be closely integrated. In order to implement the instructions of the Municipal Committee, a deputy director of the Electric Machinery Plant concurrently serves as the deputy manager of the Engineering Company, mainly responsible for the leadership of the installation department; in terms of strengthening technical forces, a chief engineer and six technicians from the plant were transferred to the equipment installation department of the Engineering Company to form a technical team responsible for guiding equipment installation. In terms of production preparation, a deputy director of the plant is specifically responsible for the leadership of production preparation. Production preparation work groups have also been organized in the main departments, and there are plans to send key cadres to the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory to learn from the advanced experience of production preparation work; a large number of production technicians will also be trained in brother factories.
    Relevant departments in Harbin are actively supporting this key project. In order to facilitate employees' commuting, the Municipal Bus Company has recently added enough buses to this route, opened new stations, and brought the buses to the doorstep; the Municipal Water Supply Company has decided to strengthen maintenance work to prevent accidents that interrupt the water source, and to improve the quality of the water; in addition to ensuring safe power supply, the Electric Power Bureau will also provide strong technical assistance.

    哈尔滨电机厂开始安装设备
    我国去年开始兴建的第一座大型电机制造厂——国营哈尔滨电机制造厂设备安装工程开始施工。该厂所要安装的新式机器设备，有的是来自社会主义国家苏联，有的是来自捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、德国等人民民主国家，有的是我国自己制造的。目前，安装设计图纸和机械设备正陆续到达，各种建筑材料已大部进入现场，全年分季度安装工程计划已经确定，设备安装基础工程已在一月十六日开工。
    为保证大型电机制造厂建设工程的完成，中共哈尔滨市委早在年前十二月上旬就组成检查组，到该厂检查和督促进行施工准备工作。本月十一日，市委又召开了厂方与施工单位以及市有关单位领导干部的专门会议，对该厂施工准备工作进行了检查，及时地批判了厂方与施工单位的领导思想上所产生的重土木建筑轻安装、重生产而忽视生产准备以及某些盲目自满情绪。指出在建厂工作中必须树立重点思想，并使设备安装工程，土木建筑工程和生产准备工作的领导密切结合。为贯彻市委的指示，电机厂由一名副厂长兼工程公司副经理，主要负责安装处的领导工作；在增强技术力量方面，调该厂一名主任工程师和六名技术员到工程公司设备安装处，组成技术小组，负责设备安装指导工作。在生产准备工作方面，该厂又由一名副厂长专门负责生产准备的领导工作。在主要的科室中也分别组织了生产准备工作小组，并且还计划派出主要干部到哈尔滨量具刃具厂，学习生产准备工作的先进经验；大批的生产技术工人也将在兄弟工厂进行培养。
    哈尔滨市有关部门正在积极支援这一重点工程。为了照顾职工上下班方便，市汽车公司最近将在这条线路上增添足够的公共汽车，开辟新的车站，将汽车送上门去；市自来水公司决定加强检修工作，以防发生事故间断水源，并要提高水的质量；电业局除保证安全供电以外，在技术力量上也将大力协助。（姜校民）
