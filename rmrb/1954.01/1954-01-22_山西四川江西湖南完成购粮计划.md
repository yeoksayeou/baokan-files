Shanxi, Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Hunan Provinces have victoriously overfulfilled the state grain purchase plan. As of January 10th, Shanxi Province had overfulfilled the grain purchase plan by 10.9%. As of December 31st of last year, Sichuan Province had overfulfilled the grain purchase plan by 3.03%. As of January 5th, Jiangxi Province had overfulfilled the grain purchase plan by 0.9%. Hunan Province also victoriously completed its grain purchase plan, with the amount purchased more than doubling that of 1952.

The propaganda and education work regarding the general line powerfully promoted the grain purchase work. Starting from November of last year, Shanxi Province established a strong contingent composed of more than 25,000 cadres and more than one million Party members and non-Party activists, who went deep into the countryside, connected with reality, and used methods such as recalling and comparing to promote the general line to the peasants. In particular, comparing the two typical villages where mutual aid and cooperation work was done well and poorly educated the masses, enabling the broad masses to distinguish between the two paths of socialism and capitalism. One hundred and thirty-six counties and their subordinate townships and villages in Sichuan Province held expanded cadre meetings, with more than 200,000 cadres studying the general line and the state's grain purchase policy. After studying, the broad district and township cadres became a strong backbone for promoting the general line and educating farmers to sell grain. In Jiangxi Province, one million grassroots cadres and activists in villages and townships received education on the general line, and they promoted the general line to more than 70% of the peasants in the province. Thirty million peasants in Hunan Province were universally educated on the general line. In places where the propaganda and education of the general line was implemented, the peasants joyfully sold their surplus grain to the state to support national industrial construction.

In the grain sales, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, agricultural labor models, mutual aid group members, and agricultural producers' cooperative members in rural areas actively played a leading role. In Shanxi Province's Yuci Special District, 528 agricultural producers' cooperatives and perennial mutual aid groups were commended and rewarded for their enthusiastic grain sales. Agricultural producers' cooperatives such as those led by Yi Ruisheng, Chen Yike, Li Yeli, Duan Moyang, and Li Youxi in Jiangxi Province successively sold more than 130,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

After being educated on the general line, the broad masses of peasants improved their understanding of organizing to develop production. As of now, more than 8,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives have been voluntarily requested to be newly established by the peasants in Shanxi Province, more than double the number last year. Among them, the establishment work of 5,200 agricultural producers' cooperatives has been brewing to maturity, and the leading cadres for establishing cooperatives are being centrally trained. In Jiangxi Province, many individual farmers are actively requesting to join mutual aid groups, and many mutual aid groups are also requesting to transition to cooperatives, and many collapsed mutual aid groups are requesting to be restored. Hunan Province will establish more than 270 agricultural producers' cooperatives and is preparing to mobilize half of the farmers to participate in mutual aid groups.

In the grain purchase work, supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives in various places have also developed.

The funds obtained by peasants from selling surplus grain were partly deposited in the People's Bank and mostly used to purchase means of production to expand production. The supply and marketing cooperatives in Shanxi Province have supplied farmers with 2,500 head of livestock and more than 14 million jin of fertilizer cake. The supply and marketing cooperatives in thirteen counties in Shanxi Province's Changzhi Special District have signed contracts with farmers to supply more than 100,000 pieces of agricultural tools. The cooperative system in Sichuan Province is preparing to supply farmers with more than twice the amount of means of production this year compared to last year. Blacksmiths and carpenters in various towns in Hunan Province are busy manufacturing plows, hoes, and other agricultural tools for farmers.

Currently, peasants in the above four provinces are going all out to carry out winter production. In Jiangxi Province's Shangrao Special District, twelve counties such as Leping and Wannian have planted a total of 1,094,000 mu of winter crops such as barley, wheat, rapeseed, peas, and broad beans; Nanchang and Pingxiang counties have overfulfilled the winter planting plan by 0.3%. Many counties are actively preparing to build mass small-scale water conservancy projects. Peasants in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province are busy repairing dikes. Mountainous peasants are also stepping up efforts to accumulate fertilizer and repair ponds and dams.

The above four provinces are continuing to deeply promote the general line to the peasants, beginning to vigorously lead and mobilize the peasants to carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, going all out to carry out winter production, and striving to increase grain production in 1954.

    山西四川江西湖南完成购粮计划
    山西、四川、江西、湖南四省，已胜利地超额完成国家粮食收购计划。山西省到一月十日止，超额完成购粮计划百分之一十点九。四川省到去年十二月三十一日止，超额完成购粮计划百分之三点零三。江西省到一月五日止，超额完成购粮计划百分之零点九。湖南省收购粮食的计划也胜利完成，收购数量比一九五二年增加了一倍多。
    总路线的宣传教育工作有力地推动了购粮工作。从去年十一月份开始，山西省建立了一支由两万五千多个干部和一百多万个党内外积极分子组成的强大队伍，深入农村，联系实际，运用回忆对比等方法，向农民宣传总路线。特别是将互助合作工作做得好和做得坏的两种典型村作对比，对群众进行教育，使广大群众划清了社会主义与资本主义两条道路的界线。四川省有一百三十六个县及所属乡、村召开了扩大干部会议，有二十多万干部学习了总路线和国家购粮政策。广大区、乡干部经过学习以后，成为宣传总路线和教育农民售粮的有力的骨干。江西省乡村基层干部和积极分子受到总路线教育的达一百万人，他们向全省百分之七十以上的农民宣传了总路线。湖南省三千万农民普遍受到了总路线教育。在贯彻了总路线宣传教育的地方，农民欢欣鼓舞地把余粮卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。
    在售粮中，农村中的共产党员、青年团员、农业劳动模范、互助组组员、农业生产合作社社员积极起带头作用。山西省榆次专区因踊跃售粮受到表扬奖励的农业生产合作社和常年互助组就有五百二十八个。江西省易瑞生、陈翊科、李页俚、段谟扬、李友秀等农业生产合作社，先后把余粮十三万多斤卖给国家。
    广大农民受到总路线教育后，对组织起来发展生产的认识有了提高。山西省到目前为止，全省农民自动要求新建的农业生产合作社有八千多个，比去年增加了两倍多。其中已有五千二百个农业生产合作社的建社工作酝酿成熟，建社的领导骨干正在集中受训。江西省有许多单干农民积极要求参加互助组，有不少的互助组也要求转社，许多垮了台的互助组要求恢复。湖南省将建立二百七十多个农业生产合作社，并准备动员一半农户参加互助组。
    在购粮工作中，各地供销合作社和信用合作社也有了发展。
    农民出卖余粮所得的款项，一部分存入了人民银行，大部分都用于购买生产资料，以扩大生产。山西省供销合作社已供应农民牲畜二千五百头，肥饼一千四百多万斤。山西省长治专区十三个县的供销合作社和农民订立供应农具十万多件的合同。四川省合作社系统今年准备供应农民的生产资料，将比去年增加两倍。湖南省各城镇的铁匠和木匠，都忙着为农民制造犁铧、锄头等农具，供应农民。
    现在，上述四省农民正在全力进行冬季生产。江西省上饶专区的乐平、万年等十二个县，已冬种的大麦、小麦、油菜、豌豆、蚕豆等作物共达一百零九万四千多亩；南昌、萍乡两县超额完成冬种计划百分之零点三。许多县正在积极准备兴修群众性的小型水利工程。湖南省洞庭湖地区农民正忙着修堤。山区农民也在加紧积肥和修整塘坝。
    上述四省正在继续深入地向农民宣传总路线，开始大力领导和发动农民开展互助合作运动，全力进行冬季生产，努力争取一九五四年粮食增产。
