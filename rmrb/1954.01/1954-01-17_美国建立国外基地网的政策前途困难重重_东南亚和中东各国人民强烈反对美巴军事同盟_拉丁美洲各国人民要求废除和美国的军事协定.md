Xinhua News Agency, January 16th: The United States' activities in establishing military bases abroad are being met with increasingly strong opposition from people of all countries. This situation indicates that the policy of establishing an overseas base network, which constitutes an important part of the U.S.'s so-called "New Look" military plan, faces numerous difficulties.

The people of Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern countries unanimously oppose the U.S. conspiracy to turn Pakistan into a military base. The people of Pakistan are widely launching a movement against the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance. Participating in this movement are not only the Communist Party of Pakistan, but also many other political parties and organizations. Many parties and organizations, such as the Jinnah Awami Muslim League, the Azad Pakistan Party, and the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, jointly issued a statement in newspapers in December 1953, opposing the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance. The Pakistan Democratic Youth Federation, the Pakistan "Women's Peace Organization," and the Karachi Democratic Students Federation have also expressed their protests one after another.

In India, which is closely related to Pakistan, the movement against the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance is expanding daily. After the All-India Peace Council held a mass meeting in December 1953, representatives of workers, women, students, and other social organizations in Delhi held a demonstration on January 10, 1954, against the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance. Ludhiana in East Punjab Province also held a march on January 8th with more than 10,000 people participating. Various parties and mass organizations in India have expressed their opposition to the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance. Agarwal, the General Secretary of the Indian ruling party, the Congress Party, said at a mass rally in Delhi on December 20, 1953, that the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance "not only caused serious unease in India but also in the entire Southeast Asia." The All-India Women's Liaison Committee and the Council of the All-India Students' Federation have both recently passed resolutions condemning the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance at their meetings.

The people and public opinion in many countries, such as Burma, Indonesia, Ceylon, and Afghanistan, have also opposed the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance. The unanimous opposition of the people of various countries has made some U.S. bourgeois public opinion feel uneasy. They demanded that the U.S. government weigh whether it is "worth it" to incur such political consequences in order to conclude the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance.

The U.S. conspiracy to turn Pakistan into a military base is only part of its new plan to cobble together a Middle East aggressive bloc. After the U.S. plan to establish a so-called "Middle East Command" failed, it is attempting to first piece together Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan into a "military axis," and then gradually drag other Near and Middle Eastern countries into the aggressive bloc. This conspiracy of the United States has been strongly opposed by the people of the Near and Middle East. In order to oppose the U.S. aggressive conspiracy, the people of these countries held a conference in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, on December 19, 1953, with representatives from all strata of the people of the Near and Middle East participating. The first article of the resolution passed by the conference was: "Do not conclude any treaty or any military agreement with any country or any group of countries that infringes upon our sovereignty and may drag us into military adventures."

The U.S.'s activities in establishing military bases in Europe are equally unpopular. The military agreement concluded between the U.S. and Franco's Spain in September 1953 has particularly aroused the indignation of honest people in various countries. Commenting on the opposition of the people of various countries to the U.S.-Spanish agreement, the Swedish bourgeois newspaper "Expressen" said: This agreement "will further strengthen anti-American sentiment in Europe and Asia." The Uruguayan newspaper "El Sol" also pointed out: This action by the United States is causing deep dissatisfaction among the Spanish-speaking people of the American continent. In the Scandinavian countries, the people have launched a more vigorous movement against the construction of military bases by the United States. Due to the widespread demands expressed by the people of Norway and Denmark in the 1953 parliamentary elections, the new governments of Norway and Denmark have been forced to declare that they do not agree to the establishment of military bases by the United States in their countries.

The people of Latin American countries such as Chile and Brazil are launching large-scale movements demanding the abolition of military agreements with the United States. Representatives of various parties and strata in Chile established the Committee for the Defense of Chilean Sovereignty in October 1953. One of the committee's tasks is to unite the Chilean people to cancel the Chilean-U.S. military agreement. In the southern states of Brazil, many peace rallies were held in 1953, and those who participated in the rallies expressed their opposition to the Brazilian-U.S. military agreement.

The Japanese people's struggle against U.S. military bases has developed into an important part of the Japanese people's struggle for peace and national independence. The U.S. military's endless expansion of military bases in Japan has aroused increasingly widespread opposition from the people. In particular, the struggle against the U.S. military's establishment of a firing range in Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture and the struggle against the U.S. military's use of Mount Asama as a training ground have won the support of people from all strata of the country, forming a large-scale movement to defend their homeland and oppose the U.S. military occupation. In order to defend Uchinada, the people of Ishikawa Prefecture have formed a united front with workers, farmers, and fishermen as the core, including students and the general public. The Japanese working class provided strong support to the farmers and fishermen with practical actions such as refusing to transport military supplies to the U.S. military. Many organizations, such as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Japan Teachers' Union, have successively convened national congresses to support the people of Uchinada Village. Even Kyodo News Agency could not but admit: "The breadth of this movement's strata is unparalleled in past similar movements." In order to strengthen the struggle against U.S. military bases, representatives from thirty-nine prefectures and trade unions and democratic organizations across Japan held the "Japanese People's Anti-Military Base Conference" in Tokyo in late June 1953.

    美国建立国外基地网的政策前途困难重重

    拉丁美洲各国人民要求废除和美国的军事协定
    【新华社十六日讯】美国在国外建立军事基地的活动，遭到了各国人民越来越强烈的反对。这种情况指明：构成美国所谓“新面貌”军事计划重要内容之一的建立国外基地网的政策，前途困难重重。
    东南亚各国和中东各国人民一致反对美国变巴基斯坦为军事基地的阴谋。巴基斯坦人民正在广泛地展开反对美巴军事同盟的运动。参加这一运动的，不仅有巴基斯坦共产党，还有许多其他的政党和组织。真纳人民回教联盟、自由巴基斯坦党、全巴基斯坦和平委员会等许多党派团体于一九五三年十二月在报纸上联合发表声明，表示反对美巴军事同盟。巴基斯坦民主青年联合会、巴基斯坦“妇女和平组织”、喀喇蚩民主学生联合会等也都先后表示抗议。
    在和巴基斯坦唇齿相依的印度，反对美巴军事同盟的运动正在日益扩大。在全印和平理事会于一九五三年十二月举行群众大会之后，德里的工人、妇女和学生以及其他社会组织的代表又于一九五四年一月十日举行了反对美巴军事同盟的示威游行。东旁遮普省卢德希那在一月八日也举行了有一万多人参加的游行。印度各党派和群众组织都表示反对美巴军事同盟，印度执政党国大党的总书记阿葛尔瓦在一九五三年十二月二十日在德里举行的群众集会上说，美巴军事同盟“不仅引起印度、而且还引起整个东南亚的严重不安”。印度全国妇女联络委员会和全印学生联合会理事会都在最近举行的会议上，通过了谴责美巴军事同盟的决议。
  缅甸、印尼、锡兰、阿富汗等许多国家的人民和舆论，也纷纷反对美巴军事同盟。各国人民的一致反对，已使美国一部分资产阶级舆论感到不安。他们要求美国政府权衡一下，为了缔结美巴军事同盟而招致这样的政治后果，是否“合算”。
    美国变巴基斯坦为军事基地的阴谋，只是它拼凑中东侵略集团新计划的一部分。美国在建立所谓“中东司令部”的计划遭到失败以后，正企图先把土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦拼凑成一个“军事轴心”，然后再把其他近中东国家逐步拉入侵略集团。美国的这种阴谋，遭到了近中东人民的强烈反对。这些国家人民为了反对美国的侵略阴谋，一九五三年十二月十九日在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特举行了有近中东各阶层人民代表参加的保卫近东中东人民权利会议。会议通过的决议第一条就是：“不和任何一国或任何一群国家缔结侵犯我们的主权并可能把我们拖入军事冒险的条约或任何军事协定。”
    美国在欧洲建立军事基地的活动，同样不得人心。美国和佛朗哥西班牙在一九五三年九月缔结的军事协定，特别引起了各国正直人们的愤慨。在评论各国人民反对美西协定时，瑞典资产阶级报纸“快报”说：这个协定“将更进一步加强欧洲和亚洲的反美情绪”，乌拉圭报纸“太阳报”也指出：美国的这一行动正引起美洲大陆上说西班牙语的人民的深为不满的情绪。在斯堪的纳维亚国家，人民更有力地展开了反对美国建筑军事基地的运动。由于挪威和丹麦人民在一九五三年的议会选举中所表示的普遍要求，挪威和丹麦的新政府已被迫声明不同意美国在他们国家内建立军事基地。
    拉丁美洲的智利、巴西等国人民正在大规模展开要求废除和美国的军事协定的运动，智利各党派和各阶层的代表已在一九五三年十月成立了保卫智利主权委员会，委员会任务之一就是要团结智利人民来取消智美军事协定。在巴西南部各州在一九五三年曾举行了许多次和平集会，参加集会的人都表示反对巴美军事协定。
    日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争，已经发展成为日本人民争取和平、争取民族独立斗争的一个重要环节。美军在日本漫无止境地扩大军事基地，激起了人民越来越广泛的反对。特别是反对美军在石川县内滩村设立打靶场和反对美军利用浅间山作为演习场的斗争，获得了全国各阶层人民的支持，形成了保卫乡土、反对美国军事占领的规模巨大的运动。石川县人民为了保卫内滩，形成了以工人、农民、渔民为核心、包括学生、广大市民在内的统一战线。日本工人阶级以拒绝给美军运输军事物资等实际行动，对农民和渔民进行了有力的支援。日本工会总评议会、日本教职员工会等许多团体均先后召开全国大会，支援内滩村人民。连共同社都不能不承认：“这个运动阶层的广泛，是过去这类运动所不能比拟的。”为了加强反对美国军事基地的斗争，日本全国三十九个都、道、府、县和工会、民主组织的代表于一九五三年六月下旬在东京举行了“日本人民反对军事基地大会”。
