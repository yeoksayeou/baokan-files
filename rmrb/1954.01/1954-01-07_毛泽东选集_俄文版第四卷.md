"Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Russian Edition, Volume Four
By Mu. Kharlamov, Soviet Union

Soviet readers are already familiar with and deeply interested in the first three volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Now, the Foreign Languages Publishing House has published the Russian edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume Four, which corresponds to Volume Three of the Chinese edition, including Comrade Mao Zedong's works from March 1941 to August 1945.

This period was an extremely complex and difficult one for the Chinese people. At that time, the Japanese invaders occupied large swathes of Chinese territory and many large cities.

Taking advantage of the Kuomintang's execution of a surrender line and its hopes of eliminating domestic democratic forces, the Japanese invaders launched brutal "mopping-up campaigns" against the liberated areas, implementing the "Three Alls Policy" of "burn all, kill all, loot all."

In 1943, Japan used 64 percent of its invading forces in China and 95 percent of its puppet troops to attack the liberated areas. The Kuomintang government's traitorous behavior had brought China to the brink of national peril.

The Communist Party of China initiated and organized the all-people War of Resistance for national independence. The works in Volume Four discuss important issues of the War of Resistance against Japan, point out the path to defeating the Chinese people's mortal enemy and building a new, democratic China, and comprehensively analyze the issue of consolidating the Communist Party of China organizationally and ideologically.

Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to the Chinese revolution. He summarized the extremely rich experience of the Chinese people's national liberation revolutionary struggle, profoundly and scientifically analyzed the nature, driving force, and future of the Chinese revolution, and stipulated the strategic line and political tasks of the Communist Party of China at each stage of the struggle. Thus, the Communist Party of China pointed out the path of national liberation and social liberation for the entire nation.

Comrade Mao Zedong is an outstanding Marxist theorist of the world liberation movement who combined Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "...Only after the First World War and the October Revolution in Russia did we find Marxism-Leninism, the best of all truths, as the best weapon for liberating our nation, and the Communist Party of China was the initiator, propagandist, and organizer who took up this weapon. Once the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism is combined with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, the face of the Chinese revolution is completely new." [1]

Comrade Mao Zedong's development and concretization of Lenin and Stalin's principles on the revolution in colonies and dependent countries in the era of imperialism, as well as his exploration of the issue of people's democracy as the form of revolutionary power of the Chinese people during the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, are valuable contributions to the treasure trove of Marxism-Leninism.

The works in Volume Four mainly discuss the War of Resistance against Japan. Based on a comprehensive and profound analysis of the domestic and international situation, Comrade Mao Zedong proved the inevitable defeat of the Japanese invaders.

Comrade Mao Zedong believed that the strength and indestructibility of the world anti-fascist movement led by the Soviet Union was the most important prerequisite for defeating the Japanese invaders. He regarded the Chinese people's national liberation war as an integral part of the international democratic forces' anti-fascist struggle. When determining the development prospects of the Chinese revolution, he first considered the victory of the anti-Hitler war.

Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in "On the Anti-Fascist International United Front": "The Soviet Union's sacred war of resistance against fascist aggression is not only to defend the Soviet Union, but also to defend all nations engaged in the liberation struggle against fascist enslavement." [2]

Crushing Hitler's Germany was a necessary condition for defeating Japanese fascism. Therefore, the Chinese people, like the people of the whole world, watched the Soviet-German front.

Comrade Mao Zedong, in his article "The Turning Point of World War II" written in 1942, analyzed the battles on the Soviet-German front, pointing out that Hitler's war machine was constantly weakening, while the strength of the Soviet Union and the entire anti-fascist alliance was growing stronger.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that after the Battle of Stalingrad (which he regarded as a turning point in human destiny), the Soviet army would launch a powerful offensive, which would determine the outcome of the war. Britain and the United States would wait until there was a dead tiger to "beat" and then open a second front, and the masses of people in the enslaved countries would more actively launch an anti-fascist struggle, which would be the third front; and Hitler would only have a dead end left.

Following the defeat of Hitler's Germany, the defeat of Japanese imperialism was inevitable.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "Greeting the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the October Revolution": "We Chinese people celebrate the victory of the Red Army, which is also celebrating our own victory. ...Although our future is still arduous, the dawn of victory is already visible. Not only is the defeat of Japanese fascism certain, but it is not far off." [3]

After explaining the international situation of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the source of the Chinese people's growing strength and demonstrated the possibility of the Chinese people defeating the enemy in various works in Volume Four, such as "An Extremely Important Policy," "Economic and Financial Problems During the War of Resistance," "Get Organized!," "We Must Learn to Do Economic Work," and "Launch the Rent Reduction, Production, and Support the Government and Cherish the People Movement in the Base Areas."

The Communist Party believes that the unity of all patriotic forces in the country is the most important condition for victory, and it has unswervingly carried out the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's surrender line, against the threat of civil war, and for consolidating and expanding the anti-Japanese national united front.

The Communist Party has repeatedly called on the patriotic forces of all nationalities to unite and jointly resist the Japanese oppressors. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his political report to the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "We Communists put forward the policy of the anti-Japanese national united front as early as 1935, and we have been fighting for it every day since then." [4]

In order to consolidate the anti-Japanese national united front, the Communist Party formulated a broad program of political and economic measures that took into account the interests of various classes and social groups concerned about the cause of national liberation. And on this basis, it consolidated its ties with all those who truly wished to resist the aggressors.

While organizing the War of Resistance Against Japan and uniting domestic patriotic forces, the Communist Party paid great attention to the consolidation of the liberated areas, which were the strongholds of national independence and democracy, and to the strengthening of the people's army, the main force in the War of Resistance Against Japan.

In the course of the fierce struggle against the Japanese invaders, the territory of the liberated areas continued to expand. The residents of these areas enjoyed extensive democratic rights and freedoms; the Communist Party took resolute measures to improve the economic conditions of the working people and develop the economy to ensure the needs of the war.

The people's army established by the Communist Party, relying on the support of the people in the liberated areas and the patriots of all China, dealt a powerful blow to the Japanese invaders and played a leading role in the cause of crushing the Japanese bandits.

Comrade Mao Zedong's research on the economic and political foundations of the state system that should be established after the elimination of foreign fetters and the abolition of feudal and fascist oppression is of great theoretical significance. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We advocate, after completely defeating the Japanese aggressors, establishing a national system of democratic alliance based on the absolute majority of the people of the whole country and under the leadership of the working class, and we call such a national system the national system of New Democracy." [5]

The new democratic regime born in the process of the victorious anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution will not be a dictatorship of one class, nor a one-party dictatorship, but a regime of alliance of several democratic classes under the leadership of the proletariat and its vanguard—the Communist Party.

The people's regime should be established on the principle of democratic centralism, which will give full freedom to democratic activities. It gives the people's congresses at all levels high powers and ensures that the government organs can centrally handle all affairs entrusted by the people's congresses.

All armed forces, like other government organs, under this system, belong to the people and protect and defend the interests of the people.

The economy of New China will consist of three components: state-owned, private-owned, and cooperative-owned.

The people's regime should first eliminate feudalism, abolish the land ownership of landlords, and carry out land reform in accordance with the principle of "land to the tillers." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party agreed to temporarily not raise the demand for land reform, believing that it was appropriate to only implement rent reduction and interest reduction. However, the Communists repeatedly emphasized that as long as the environment was favorable, the issue of land reform would be placed on the agenda.

The Communist Party did not and could not propose the task of eliminating capitalism and building socialism under the conditions at that time, which was not to conceal its socialist goals, but because the material preconditions for solving this task were not yet available. Due to the backward agricultural economy, the rampant foreign capital, anti-national comprador bourgeoisie, and feudal relations, China was not suffering from too much domestic capitalism, but from the oppression of foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism. The Communist Party believed that it was possible and necessary to develop capitalism to a certain extent, which would help revitalize the national economy. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "We Communists, based on our understanding of the laws of social development in Marxism, clearly know that under the conditions of China, under the national system of New Democracy, in addition to the state's own economy, the individual economy of the working people, and the cooperative economy, we must allow the private capitalist economy to develop within the scope that cannot manipulate the national economy, so that it will be beneficial to the forward development of society." [6]

All these principles constitute the minimum program of the Communist Party of China during the entire anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution stage. This program is in line with the requirements of the overwhelming majority of the people in the country, namely the vast strata of industrial workers and handicraftsmen, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie.

The Communist Party of China has victoriously implemented this program in the long and arduous struggle. China has freed itself from the shackles of Japan and other foreign imperialists and won national independence. In fierce battles, Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people, feudal, and fascist regime was overthrown, and a people's democratic system was established, under which the people enjoy extensive democratic rights and freedoms. The current people's government in China includes representatives of workers, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie. The leading role in the entire political life of the country belongs to the working class and its vanguard—the Communist Party of China. Now, land reform in the country is about to be completed, which has eliminated feudalism and fundamentally changed the situation in rural areas. Industry has begun to develop rapidly after the people's regime won victory. The state-owned economy plays a leading role in the economic field. At the same time, private capitalist enterprises that help consolidate the country's economic strength also have opportunities for activity.

The various profound democratic reforms implemented by the Communist Party of China are preparing the necessary material and political preconditions for the future transition to the task of building socialism.

The issue of creating a people's culture, especially literature and art, occupies a large space in the works of Volume Four.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art: "In our struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people, there are various fronts, among which it can be said that there are two fronts, one cultural and one military, that is, the cultural front and the military front." [7]

The view on the issue of new culture construction is fully in line with Lenin's principle of using cultural heritage.

Comrade Mao Zedong first raised a question in his speech: Who should literature and art serve?

He said that in the present world, all culture or literature and art belongs to a certain class and belongs to a certain political line. Art for art's sake, trans-class art, and art that runs parallel to or is independent of politics do not actually exist.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that Chinese Communists attach great importance to the rich literary and artistic heritage and excellent literary and artistic traditions left over from past eras in China and abroad, but at the same time they should critically transform them and use them to serve the people.

Critically transforming and using cultural heritage is only part of the task. The most important thing is to create new literature and art on the basis of past literary and artistic achievements, and this new literature and art should reflect the people's lives and struggles, serve the people, and defend and maintain the interests of the people. "All dark forces that endanger the masses of the people must be exposed, and all revolutionary struggles of the masses of the people must be praised. This is the basic task of revolutionary artists." [8]

After raising the task of creating a new culture, Comrade Mao Zedong talked in detail about the road to new culture construction, especially the relationship between art and life, the interrelationship between artistic level and popularization, and the ideological and artistic nature of literary and artistic works.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that literary and artistic works are the product of the reflection of a certain social life in the human mind. Life is the inexhaustible and inexhaustible only source of all literature and art. In order to create a new people's culture, it is not enough to simply be familiar with the achievements of past cultures, but it is necessary to be close to the people, observe and study the lives and struggles of all working people, and understand the inner thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, soldiers, and handicraftsmen.

The issue of literary and artistic popularization is of great significance to China. The thinkers of the exploiting classes deliberately complicate their works to alienate them from the people. In order to build a free and prosperous China, it is required that literary and artistic works combine a high artistic level with mass appeal and popularization.

Comrade Mao Zedong put forward two criteria for evaluating works of art, namely political criteria and artistic criteria, which are unified and inseparable. The political standard is to see what kind of ideas the work puts forward and adheres to, and how it serves the people, while the artistic standard is to see how perfect the work is in terms of art.

"...We are against works of art with erroneous political views, and we are also against the so-called 'slogan-style' tendency that has only correct political views but no artistic power. We should carry out a two-front struggle on literary and artistic issues." [9]

The Communist Party of China put forward and insisted on the proposition of establishing the culture of the Chinese people, determined to unite all democratic and patriotic cultural workers on the basis of cultural construction, and at the same time strive to continuously consolidate and develop proletarian ideology in all aspects of domestic spiritual life, and continuously weaken and exclude reactionary non-proletarian ideology.

The Communist Party of China led the Chinese people in a long and heroic struggle for national independence, democracy, and national prosperity with full confidence.

Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "The experience of the three revolutions, especially the experience of the War of Resistance Against Japan, has given us and the Chinese people such confidence: Without the efforts of the Communist Party of China, without the Communist Party of China as the mainstay of the Chinese people, China's independence and liberation is impossible, and China's industrialization and agricultural modernization are also impossible." [10]

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, following the doctrines of Marx and Lenin on the Party, creatively applied the richest experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, summarized its own experience in party building, and carried out tremendous work in the organizational, political, and ideological unity of the Party.

Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Communist Party of China and the entire Chinese people, played an outstanding role in the struggle to consolidate the Party and unite the Party's ranks. He consistently carried out the struggle faithful to Marxism-Leninism and set an example of creatively developing theory and applying it to the Chinese revolution.

Since its establishment, the Communist Party of China has overcome and shattered various tendencies that deviated from the Marxist-Leninist line on organizational and political issues: "Left" and right, dogmatism and empiricism, sectarianism and tailism, and so on.

In the "Resolution on Certain Historical Issues" adopted by the Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on April 20, 1945, which was published as an appendix in Volume Four, the heroic path the Party has traversed, its achievements and victories, and its achievements in the struggle against various opportunists are summarized concisely and scientifically.

In the resolutions of the Central Plenary Session and Comrade Mao Zedong's works, the practical activities and theoretical viewpoints of the Party's third "Left" leaning group were emphatically criticized. This group was formed around January 1931, and it seized the leadership position within the Party, seriously affecting the Party's policies until 1935.

The "Left" leaning elements ignored Comrade Stalin's instructions on the tasks of the Chinese revolution at the present stage, which are to oppose imperialist and feudal forces, and they opposed Comrade Mao Zedong, who consistently defended and developed this line. The "Left" leaning elements put forward adventurous demands against all the bourgeoisie and the slogan of eliminating the rich peasant economy. They opposed Comrade Mao Zedong's operational policy on revolutionary war and denied the necessity of establishing revolutionary base areas.

Comrade Mao Zedong attached great importance to the Party's organizational, political, and ideological unity. He wrote: "As long as our Communist Party's ranks are neat, our steps are consistent, our soldiers are elite soldiers, and our weapons are good weapons, then any powerful enemy can be defeated by us." [11] Although the "Left" leaning group had failed in 1935, the influence of the "Left" leaning elements continued for a period of time.

From 1941 to 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong exposed the ideological essence of various tendencies, especially "Left" leaning, in many of his works, such as "Reform Our Study," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," and "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing." He pointed out that

"Left" leaning is a manifestation of petty-bourgeois ideology and petty-bourgeois style in the Party's life. This tendency inevitably abandons Marxism-Leninism in theory, allowing subjectivism, stereotyped Party writing, and dogmatism to occupy a dominant position, while in the Party's life it inevitably leads to sectarianism. Sectarianism is a manifestation of subjectivism in the Party's work, which separates the Party's leading organs from ordinary Party members and from the broad strata of the Chinese people. The obvious manifestation of subjectivism in theory is dogmatism and empiricism.

All of these greatly reduced the ideological level of theoretical study by Communist Party members, reduced the work level of Party organizations, and weakened the Party's combat effectiveness. Therefore, the issue of overcoming subjectivism and sectarianism is of particular importance.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that it is necessary to resolutely overcome all subjective remnants in politics and theory, and put forward the task of resolutely changing the Party's style of work to fully comply with the requirements of Marxism-Leninism.

Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "The universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, which reflects the practical struggle of the proletariat all over the world, becomes a weapon for the Chinese people to win every battle when it is combined with the specific practice of the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese proletariat and the broad masses of the people." [12]

In order to further unite the Party ideologically and to improve the ideological level of the Party's work, Comrade Mao Zedong called for carrying out a movement to creatively study Marxism-Leninism and closely link theory with practice. He resolutely pointed out that many Communist Party members learn partial and incomplete knowledge because they do not study correctly.

Comrade Mao Zedong wrote that there are two kinds of incomplete knowledge: one is the knowledge in ready-made books that lacks practical experience, so it has the nature of dogmatism; the other is the knowledge that has only personal experience but lacks a profound theoretical foundation, so its essence is empiricism.

Only the close combination of theory and practice can produce true Marxist-Leninist knowledge.

"Those who have book knowledge should develop towards practical aspects, and then they can not stop in books, and they can not commit the error of dogmatism. Those who have work experience should learn towards theoretical aspects, and they should read seriously..." [13]

Comrade Mao Zedong believes that further strengthening the Party's ties with the masses and making the Party's work closer to the masses is the most effective way to eliminate sectarian errors.

He pointed out that as long as we rely on the people, firmly believe in the infinite creative power of the masses of the people, and become one with them, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties, no enemy can defeat us, on the contrary, we can defeat any enemy.

Comrade Mao Zedong believes that serving the masses and resolutely fighting for the interests of the masses is the Party's lofty mission.

"The Communist Party is a political party that seeks the interests of the nation and the people, and it has absolutely no private interests to seek. It should be supervised by the people, and it should never go against the will of the people. Its members should stand among the masses, and they should never stand above the masses." [14]

Comrade Mao Zedong comprehensively elaborated on the necessity of extensively carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the struggle to consolidate the Party, and he regarded criticism and self-criticism as the main means of eliminating errors and shortcomings.

From 1942 to 1944, a series of discussions were held within the Communist Party of China on Comrade Mao Zedong's speeches on certain historical issues within the Party. These discussions gave a thorough blow to all remnants of petty-bourgeois ideology, eliminated the remaining poison of "Left" leaning, and better tempered the Party ideologically.

Thus, the entire Party united to tackle the following great tasks: completely smashing the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries who launched a civil war with the support of American imperialism.

All of Comrade Mao Zedong's works are filled with strong confidence in the Chinese people, in the victory of the revolution, and in the bright future of the country. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have shown their great strength, shattered the shackles of imperialist and feudal oppression, and are now advancing confidently on the road of progress.

### “毛泽东选集”俄文版第四卷
姆·哈尔拉莫夫

第3版()
专栏：

    “毛泽东选集”俄文版第四卷
     苏联  姆·哈尔拉莫夫
    苏联读者已熟知并深切注意了“毛泽东选集”头三卷。现在外国书籍出版局又出版了“毛泽东选集”俄文版第四卷，它相当于中文版第三卷，其中包括毛泽东同志一九四一年三月至一九四五年八月的著作。
    这个时期对中国人民来说，是一个极其复杂和极其困难的时期。当时日本侵略者占领了中国的大片国土和许多大城市。
    日本侵略者利用国民党执行投降路线和指望消灭国内民主力量的机会，对解放区大举进行了残酷的“扫荡战”，实行烧光、杀光、抢光的“三光政策”。
    一九四三年，日本用它在中国百分之六十四的侵略军和百分之九十五的伪军进攻解放区。国民党政府的卖国行为已陷中国于民族危亡的边缘。
    中国共产党倡导并组织了争取民族独立的全民抗战。第四卷中的著作研讨了抗日战争的重要问题，指出了战胜中国人民的死敌和建设新的、民主的中国的道路，并全面分析了在组织上和思想上巩固中国共产党的问题。
    毛泽东同志把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说创造性地应用于中国革命。他总结了中国人民民族解放革命斗争的极为丰富的经验，深刻而科学地分析了中国革命的性质、动力和前途，规定了中国共产党在各个斗争阶段上的战略路线和政治任务，于是中国共产党也就为全国人民指出了民族解放和社会解放的道路。
    毛泽东同志是世界解放运动的卓越的马克思主义理论家，他将马克思列宁主义和中国革命的实践结合起来。
    毛泽东同志写道：“……第一次世界大战和俄国十月革命之后，才找到马克思列宁主义这个最好的真理，作为解放我们民族的最好的武器，而中国共产党则是拿起这个武器的倡导者、宣传者和组织者。马克思列宁主义的普遍真理一经和中国革命的具体实践相结合，就使中国革命的面目为之一新。”〔一〕
    毛泽东同志对列宁斯大林关于帝国主义时代殖民地和附属国革命的原理的发展和使之具体化，以及他对作为中国人民在反帝反封建革命时期革命政权形式的人民民主制问题的探讨，是对马克思列宁主义宝库的珍贵的贡献。
    第四卷的著作主要是谈的抗日战争问题。毛泽东同志根据对国内外形势的全面而深刻的分析，证明了日本侵略者的必败。
    毛泽东同志认为以苏联为首的世界反法西斯运动的强大和不可摧毁是战胜日本侵略者的最重要的前提。他把中国人民民族解放战争看作国际民主力量反法西斯斗争的一个组成部分，他确定中国革命的发展前途时首先就考虑到反希特勒战争的胜利。
    毛泽东同志在“关于反法西斯的国际统一战线”一文中写道：“苏联抵抗法西斯侵略的神圣战争，不仅是保卫苏联的，而且也是保卫正在进行反对法西斯奴役的解放斗争的一切民族的。”〔二〕
    粉碎希特勒德国是战胜日本法西斯的必要条件，因此，中国人民也像全世界人民一样注视着苏德前线。
    毛泽东同志在一九四二年写的“第二次世界大战的转折点”一文中，分析了苏德前线的战役，指出希特勒的战争机器不断的削弱，而苏联和整个反法西斯同盟的力量却日益增强。
    毛泽东同志指出，在斯大林格勒战役后（他把这一战役看作人类命运的转折点），苏军就要展开强大的进攻，这将决定战争的结局，英美等到有死老虎可“打”的时机，就会开辟第二条战线，而被奴役的各国人民群众将更加积极地展开反法西斯的斗争，这是第三条战线；而希特勒则只剩下死路一条了。
    继希特勒德国失败之后，必然是日本帝国主义的失败。
    毛泽东同志在“祝十月革命二十五周年”一文中指出：“我们中国人民庆祝红军的胜利，同时也即是庆祝自己的胜利。……我们的前途虽然还有艰苦，但是胜利的曙光已经看得见了。战胜日本法西斯不但是确定的，而且是不远的了。”〔三〕
    毛泽东同志于说明中国人民解放斗争的国际形势之后，在第四卷的“一个极其重要的政策”、“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”、“组织起来”、“必须学会做经济工作”、“开展根据地的减租、生产和拥政爱民运动”等各篇著作中指出了中国人民力量日益增长的源泉，并论证了中国人民战胜敌人的可能性。
    共产党认为国内一切爱国力量的团结是胜利的最重要的条件，并坚定不移地进行了反对蒋介石的投降路线、反对内战威胁、争取巩固和扩大抗日民族统一战线的斗争。
    共产党不止一次地号召一切民族的爱国力量团结起来，共同反抗日本压迫者。毛泽东同志在中国共产党第七次全国代表大会上的政治报告中说道：“我们共产党人还在一九三五年就提出了抗日民族统一战线的方针，没有一天不为此而奋斗。”〔四〕
    为了巩固抗日民族统一战线，共产党制定了政治和经济措施的广泛纲领，这个纲领是照顾到关心国家解放事业的各个不同阶级和社会集团的利益的。并在这个基础上巩固了同一切真正愿意反抗侵略者的人们的联系。
    共产党于组织抗日战争，联合国内爱国力量的同时，对争取民族独立和民主的堡垒解放区的巩固，对抗日战争的主要力量人民军队的加强，给予了极大的注意。
    在反抗日本侵略者的残酷斗争中，解放区的领土不断扩大了。这些区域的居民享受着广泛的民主权利和自由；共产党采取了坚决的措施来改善劳动人民的经济状况，发展经济以保证战争的需要。
    共产党所建立的人民军队，依靠解放区人民和全中国的爱国者的支持，给了日本侵略者以有力的打击，并在粉碎日寇的事业中起了首要的作用。
    毛泽东同志对于在消灭外国羁绊、废除封建的与法西斯的压迫之后所应当建立的国家制度的经济和政治基础问题的研究，具有极大的理论意义。毛泽东同志说道：“我们主张在澈底地打败日本侵略者之后，建立一个以全国绝对大多数人民为基础而在工人阶级领导之下的统一战线的民主联盟的国家制度，我们把这样的国家制度称之为新民主主义的国家制度。”〔五〕
    在胜利的反帝反封建革命的进程中所诞生的新的民主的政权将不是一个阶级的专政，不是一党独裁，而是几个民主阶级在无产阶级及其先锋队—共产党领导之下的联盟的政权。
    人民政权应该建立在民主集中制的原则上，它将给与民主活动以充分自由。赋予各级人民代表大会以高度的权力，并保证政权机关能够集中地处理人民代表大会所委托的一切事务。
    所有的武装力量，如同其他的政权机关一样，在这个制度下，是属于人民并保护和捍卫人民的利益的。
    新中国的经济将由国家经营、私人经营和合作社经营三者组成。
    人民政权首先应当消灭封建主义、废除地主的土地占有制、按照“耕者有其田”的原则进行土地改革。在抗日战争时期，共产党同意了暂时不提出进行土地改革的要求，认为只实行减租减息是适宜的。但共产党人再三强调说，只要环境一顺利，土地改革问题就将被提到议事日程。
    共产党在当时的条件下没有提出也不能提出消灭资本主义和建设社会主义的任务，这并不是隐瞒自己的社会主义目的，而是因为解决这一任务的物质前提尚未具备。由于落后的农业经济，由于外国资本、反民族的买办资产阶级和封建关系的横行霸道，中国不是苦于本国资本主义太多，而是苦于外国帝国主义和本国封建主义的压迫。共产党认为在一定限度内发展资本主义是可能的和必要的，这将有助于国家经济的振兴。毛泽东同志指出，“我们共产党人根据自己对于马克思主义的社会发展规律的认识，明确地知道，在中国的条件下，在新民主主义的国家制度下，除了国家自己的经济、劳动人民的个体经济和合作社经济之外，一定要让私人资本主义经济在不能操纵国民生计的范围内获得发展的便利，才能有益于社会的向前发展。”〔六〕
    所有这些原理构成了中国共产党在整个反帝反封建革命阶段的最低纲领。这一纲领是符合国内压倒多数的人民即产业工人和手工业工人、农民、城市小资产阶级的广大阶层和民族资产阶级的要求的。
    中国共产党在长期的残酷的斗争过程中胜利地把这个纲领付诸实施了。中国摆脱了日本及其他外国帝国主义者的枷锁，争得了民族独立。在激烈的战斗中蒋介石的反人民的、封建的和法西斯的制度被推翻了，人民民主制度确立了，在这种制度下人民获得广泛的民主权利和自由。中国现存的人民政府包括有工人、农民、城市小资产阶级、知识分子和民族资产阶级的代表。国家的全部政治生活中的领导作用属于工人阶级及其先锋队——中国共产党。现在，国内土地改革即将完成，它消灭了封建主义并根本改变了农村的状况。在人民政权获得胜利后工业已开始迅速发展。国营经济在经济领域中担当着主导的作用。同时，有助于巩固国家经济实力的私人资本主义企业也有了活动的机会。
    中国共产党所实行的各种深刻的民主改革，正在为将来过渡到建设社会主义的任务准备必要的物质和政治前提。
    关于创造人民文化问题，尤其是文学和艺术问题，在第四卷著作中占了很大的篇幅。
    毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中指出：“在我们为中国人民解放的斗争中，有各种的战线，就中也可以说有文武两个战线，这就是文化战线和军事战线。”〔七〕
    对于新文化建设问题的看法，是完全符合列宁主义关于利用文化遗产的原理的。
    毛泽东同志在讲话中首先提出一个问题：文艺应该为谁服务？
    他说，在现在的世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定阶级的，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。
    毛泽东同志指出，中国共产党员对于中国和外国过去时代所遗留下来的丰富的文学艺术遗产和优良的文学艺术传统是很重视的，但同时应对它们予以批判地改造，并利用它们为人民服务。
    批判地改造和利用文化遗产，这仅仅是任务的一部分。最主要的是在过去文艺成就的基础上创造新的文艺，这种新文艺应该反映人民的生活和斗争，为人民服务，保卫和维护人民的利益。“一切危害人民群众的黑暗势力必须暴露之，一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之，这就是革命文艺家的基本任务。”〔八〕
    毛泽东同志在提出创造新文化的任务之后，详尽地谈到关于新文化建设的道路问题，尤其是关于艺术对于生活的关系、艺术水平和普及的相互关系，以及文艺作品的思想性和艺术性等问题。
    毛泽东同志指出，文艺作品是一定的社会生活在人类头脑中的反映的产物。生活是一切文学艺术取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一源泉。为了创造新的人民的文化，仅仅通晓过去文化的成就是不够的，必须接近人民，观察和研究一切劳动者的生活和斗争，了解工人、农民、士兵和手工业者的内在的思想感情。
    文艺普及问题对中国来说具有极重要的意义。剥削阶级的思想家蓄意把自己的作品复杂化，使其与人民脱离。为了建设自由和繁荣的中国，就要求文艺作品把高度艺术水平与大众化和普及化结合起来。
    毛泽东同志提出了评价艺术作品的两个标准，即政治标准和艺术标准，这两者是统一而不可分割的。政治标准就是要看作品提出和坚持怎样的思想，它怎样服务于人民，而艺术标准就是看作品在艺术方面完美的程度如何。
    “……我们既反对政治观点错误的艺术品，也反对只有正确的政治观点而没有艺术力量的所谓 ‘标语口号式’的倾向。我们应该进行文艺问题上的两条战线斗争。”〔九〕
    中国共产党提出并坚持建立中国人民文化的主张，抱定目的要在文化建设的基础上团结一切民主的、爱国的文化工作者，同时力求在国内精神生活各方面不断地巩固和发展无产阶级思想，不断地削弱和排挤反动的非无产阶级思想。
    中国共产党满怀信心地领导了中国人民争取民族独立、民主和国家繁荣的长期而英勇的斗争。
    毛泽东同志写道：“三次革命的经验，尤其是抗日战争的经验，给了我们和中国人民这样一种信心：没有中国共产党的努力，没有中国共产党人做中国人民的中流砥柱，中国的独立和解放是不可能的，中国的工业化和农业近代化也是不可能的。”〔十〕
    中国共产党中央委员会遵循着马克思、列宁关于党的学说，创造性地运用了苏联共产党最丰富的经验，总结了自己的建党经验，在党的组织上、政治上和思想上的团结方面进行了巨大的工作。
    中国共产党和全中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志在巩固党和团结党的队伍的斗争中起了卓越的作用。他一贯进行着忠实于马克思列宁主义的斗争，树立了创造性地发展理论，并将其运用到中国革命中的榜样。
    中国共产党自成立以来克服了和粉碎了在组织问题、政治问题上各种各样的脱离马克思列宁主义路线的倾向：“左”倾和右倾，教条主义和经验主义，宗派主义和尾巴主义等等。
    在第四卷中作为附录发表的一九四五年四月二十日中国共产党第六届中央委员会扩大的第七次全体会议所通过的“关于若干历史问题的决议”中，扼要而科学地总结了党所走过的英勇的道路，总结了它的成就和胜利以及它在反对各种机会主义分子的斗争中所获得的成绩。
    在中央全会的决议和毛泽东同志的著作中，着重地批评了党内第三次“左”倾集团的实践活动和理论观点。这一集团形成于一九三一年一月间，它夺取了党内的领导地位，直到一九三五年为止严重地影响着党的政策。
      “左”倾分子忽视了斯大林同志关于中国革命现阶段的任务是反帝反封建势力的指示，他们反对一贯捍卫和发展着这条路线的毛泽东同志。“左”倾分子提出了反对一切资产阶级的冒险要求和消灭富农经济的口号。他们反对毛泽东同志关于革命战争的作战方针，否认建立革命根据地的必要性。
    毛泽东同志非常重视党在组织上、政治上和思想上的团结。他写道：“只要我们共产党的队伍是整齐的，步调是一致的，兵是精兵，武器是好武器，那末，任何强大的敌人都是能被我们打倒的。”〔十一〕一九三五年“左”倾集团虽然已经失败，但“左”倾分子的影响仍然继续了一个时期。
      一九四一年至一九四二年毛泽东同志在自己的许多篇著作，如“改造我们的学习”、“整顿党的作风”、“反对党八股”以及其他著作中，揭露了各种倾向，首先是“左”倾的思想本质。他指明，
  “左”倾是小资产阶级思想和小资产阶级作风在党内生活中的一种表现。这种倾向在理论上必然背弃马克思列宁主义，使主观主义、党八股和教条主义占据统治地位，而在党内生活中则必然引起宗派主义。宗派主义是主观主义在党的工作中的一种表现，它使党的领导机关脱离普通党员，脱离中国人民的广大阶层。主观主义在理论上的明显表现就是教条主义和经验主义。
    所有这些都大大降低了共产党员理论学习的思想水平，降低了党组织的工作水平和削弱了党的战斗力。因此，克服主观主义和宗派主义的问题，就具有了特别重要的意义。
    毛泽东同志指出必须坚决克服政治上和理论上的一切主观主义残余，提出了坚决改变党的工作作风以完全符合于马克思列宁主义要求的任务。
    毛泽东同志写道：“反映了全世界无产阶级实践斗争的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，在它同中国无产阶级和广大人民群众的革命斗争的具体实践相结合的时候，就成为中国人民百战百胜的武器。”〔十二〕
    为了进一步在思想上团结党，为了提高全党工作的思想水平，毛泽东同志号召开展创造性地研究马克思列宁主义和理论密切联系实际的运动。他坚决指出，有许多共产党员因为学习不正确，所以学得的知识是片面的、不完全的。
    毛泽东同志写道，有两种不完全的知识：一种是现成书本上的缺乏实践的知识，因此它带有教条主义的性质；一种是仅有个人经验，而缺乏深刻的理论基础，因此就其实质来说乃是经验主义的知识。
    只有理论与实践密切结合才能产生真正的马克思列宁主义知识。
      “有书本知识的人向实际方面发展，然后才可以不停止在书本上，才可以不犯教条主义的错误。有工作经验的人，要向理论方面学习，要认真读书……。”〔十三〕
    毛泽东同志认为，进一步加强党与群众的联系，使全党的工作更加接近群众乃是消灭宗派主义错误的最有效的方法。
    他指出，只要我们依靠人民，坚信人民群众的无穷尽的创造力量，并与他们打成一片，我们就一定能克服一切困难，任何敌人都不能战胜我们，相反的，我们却能打败任何敌人。
    毛泽东同志认为，为群众服务和为群众的利益坚决奋斗乃是党的崇高使命。
      “共产党是为民族、为人民谋利益的政党，它本身决无私利可图。它应该受人民的监督，而决不应该违背人民的意旨。它的党员应该站在民众之中，而决不应该站在民众之上。”〔十四〕
    毛泽东同志在巩固党的斗争中全面地阐明了广泛开展批评与自我批评的必要性，他把批评和自我批评看成是消灭错误与缺点的主要手段。
    在一九四二年至一九四四年间，在中国共产党内曾就毛泽东同志的言论对于党内若干历史问题进行了一系列的讨论。这些讨论给了小资产阶级思想的一切残余以澈底的打击，消灭了“左”倾余毒，并在思想上更好地锻炼了党。
    于是全党就团结一致地来着手解决下列的伟大任务：澈底粉碎日寇和在美帝国主义支持下发动内战的国民党反动派。
    毛泽东同志的一切著作充满着对于中国人民、对于革命胜利和国家光明未来的坚强信心。中国人民在中国共产党领导下显示了自己的强大力量，粉碎了帝国主义和封建主义压迫的枷锁，现在正满怀信心地循着进步的道路前进。
