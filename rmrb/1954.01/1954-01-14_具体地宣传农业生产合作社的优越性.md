Critique of Newspaper Work:

    Specifically Promote the Superiority of Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Shixin
    One of the important experiences of newspapers across the country in promoting the General Line to farmers is that they must be good at educating farmers to recognize the correctness of the Party's calls and policies, starting from the farmers' own immediate interests and practical experiences. Our newspapers should further guide farmers to develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations on the basis of the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers to take the socialist road. Because agricultural production cooperatives are "good in direction, high in yield, and high in income," they are increasingly showing an important position in the current entire mutual aid and cooperation movement and are increasingly becoming an important link for the Party to lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement to continue to move forward. Therefore, strengthening the publicity of agricultural production cooperatives is of particularly great significance. In this regard, the Shanxi Daily's publicity on agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, especially on the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, in the past two months or so, is a good start.
    To attract farmers to actively participate in mutual aid and cooperation, only the methods of persuasion, education, and typical demonstrations can be adopted. "Demonstrations are multifaceted, but everything needs to be able to truly improve productivity and achieve the goal of producing more grain or other crops and increasing income. Only under the call of producing more grain and increasing income is it possible to mobilize farmers to organize." (The "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" promulgated in February 1953). In accordance with the spirit of this instruction and combined with the actual situation in Shanxi, the Shanxi Daily took consolidating and developing agricultural production cooperatives as the central task of carrying out winter agricultural production, starting from the results of the autumn harvest distribution, and prominently promoted the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. On the one hand, the newspaper comprehensively reported the great achievements of agricultural production cooperatives in the entire province, a special district, and a county in 1953, with significant increases in harvest compared to individual farmers and mutual aid teams. On the other hand, it widely introduced typical examples of agricultural production cooperatives in different regions and under different conditions that improved production and increased income. For example, the report on November 3rd, "Wu Houli Cooperative Receives 'Four Joys' This Year," illustrates that the Wu Houli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, due to giving full play to the advantages of collective management and comprehensively organizing members to produce, achieved comprehensive increases in production not only in agricultural production but also in forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production, thus greatly increasing the income of members. The report on November 21st, "Zhao Cheng Chen Guangliang Agricultural Cooperative Yields More Grain," shows that the cooperative, due to the rational use of land and labor and the improvement of cultivation techniques, yielded an average of two shi and four sheng and eight ge of grain per mu of autumn field in 1953, exceeding the average yield of one dou and three sheng and eight ge per mu of the best Chen Guangsheng Mutual Aid Team in the village, and three dou and one sheng and eight ge more than the best individual farmer Chen Jiuer per mu. The report on November 25th, "From Three Hundred and Sixty-Three Jin to Five Hundred and Thirty-Three Jin," illustrates that although the Feng Haike Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huguan County is located in a mountainous area mostly consisting of slopes and terraces, and is threatened by drought and floods year after year, it still increased production for three consecutive years, with the output in 1953 exceeding 295 percent of the pre-War of Resistance against Japan production level, and 97.4 percent higher than in 1950 when it was still a mutual aid team. Through these typical examples, the newspaper not only accurately proved that agricultural production cooperatives can yield more grain than mutual aid teams and individual farmers, but also specifically revealed the reasons why they can yield more grain, that is, due to the growth of socialist factors within agricultural production cooperatives, due to the unified management of land and unified use of labor, which facilitates solving the difficulties of production materials, facilitates improving and upgrading cultivation techniques, and facilitates overcoming various natural disasters, which can overcome the weaknesses of the small-peasant economy to a considerable extent, and can solve some contradictions that are difficult to solve in mutual aid teams.
    While vigorously publicizing the typical examples of agricultural production cooperatives increasing grain production and increasing the income of members, the Shanxi Daily also effectively adopted the method of farmers "speaking from personal experience," using the personal experience of farmers participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, especially participating in agricultural production cooperatives, to conduct self-education among farmers. The article "‘Four Worries’ Become Four Fears No More," published on November 8th, compared individual farming and cooperation through the self-narration of Zhai Shuquan, a member of the Xuwu Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hunyuan County: in the past, when farming individually, due to the lack of labor, there were "Four Worries" – worry about planting, worry about watering, worry about weeding, worry about harvesting; after joining the agricultural production cooperative, "more people means more strength, collective management, everything is done thoughtfully," planting, watering, weeding, and harvesting are no longer worries. A letter from Zhang Laiyuan, a member of the Lvcun Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuxiang County, published on December 5th, also stated that although the elderly farmer Zhang Laiyuan was allocated 18 mu of land in the land reform, due to his age and the lack of manpower, "he could not plant on time every year, and he could not yield more grain after the autumn harvest"; he joined the mutual aid team in 1951, which solved many difficulties of individual farming, "not only did he yield more grain, but he was also not as busy and flustered as when he farmed individually"; in the winter of 1952, after he joined the agricultural production cooperative, he was not only able to engage in labor suitable for his physical strength, but also earned "13 shi (of grain) more than the mutual aid team and 17 shi more than when farming individually, and the whole family's life was greatly improved" after a year. Therefore, Zhang Laiyuan "is determined to always listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow the Communist Party." The personal experiences of different farm households from various places who joined the agricultural production cooperatives published in the newspaper not only further clarified the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives from many aspects, but also established vivid examples for the broad masses of farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation to achieve common prosperity, which is obviously a practical and effective education for the masses of farmers.
    When publicizing the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, the Shanxi Daily also used the facts of mutual aid and cooperation in the special column, using the methods of factual comparison and specific accounting, to conduct systematic analysis and criticism against the misunderstandings and suspicions of farmers about agricultural production cooperatives. Since late November, the newspaper's special column on mutual aid and cooperation has continuously and intensively criticized various ideas of some farmers who are afraid of "not being free" if they participate in agricultural production cooperatives, farmers with strong labor and good skills who believe that they can improve production without engaging in mutual aid and cooperation, farmers with more land and less labor who are worried that they will suffer losses after joining the cooperative, and farmers with relatively good production conditions and relatively wealthy lives who attempt to get rich through individual farming. When conducting this criticism, the newspaper selected typical people and typical events for comparison and accompanied them with small commentaries of "a few words". For example, on December 8th, it used the facts of Bai Gejie of Shiling Village in Xing County and Chen Xishun of Shangchao Village in Yishi County, both of whom had strong labor and good skills, the former joining the agricultural production cooperative and receiving more grain, and the latter withdrawing from the agricultural production cooperative and receiving less cotton, to "settle accounts for people with strong labor and good skills." Facts have proved that there are many difficulties in individual farming, while agricultural production cooperatives can overcome many difficulties that individual farming cannot overcome. Therefore, people with strong labor and high skills can only become prosperous by participating in agricultural production cooperatives. Moreover, since agricultural production cooperatives mainly distribute dividends based on labor, the stronger the labor and the higher the skills, the more one should join the cooperative to give full play to one's strengths. On December 23rd, it used the facts of Chai Yinshuo and Chai Dehong of Dongdu Village in the Fifth District of Wenxi County, both of whom had more land and less labor, the former joining the agricultural production cooperative and earning more than 1,000 jin of grain more than in previous years, and the latter joining and then withdrawing from the cooperative, resulting in 200 jin less grain than farm households with similar conditions, for comparison. After analyzing that agricultural production cooperatives unified management of land and can, therefore, achieve "make the best use of the land," the newspaper pointed out that it is also beneficial for farm households with more land and less labor to participate in agricultural production cooperatives. By systematically resolving various misunderstandings and concerns of farmers about agricultural production cooperatives through persuasive facts, the newspaper more deeply and specifically demonstrated all aspects of the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives.
    Agricultural production cooperatives are not only a relatively advanced agricultural production organization, but also a school for the Party to conduct realistic socialist education for farmers. Members of agricultural production cooperatives have a higher political consciousness due to collective labor and unified use of the means of production. They are not only superior to individual farmers in production, but also the basic force in rural areas who warmly respond to the Party and government's various calls and actively implement the Party and government's various policies in politics. When publicizing the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, the Shanxi Daily did not ignore this important aspect. In grain purchase reports, the newspaper focused on publicizing the exemplary actions of members of agricultural production cooperatives in various places who recognized the consistency of the interests of national construction and individual interests, thereby taking the lead in selling surplus grain. The report on December 27th on the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Datong County leading poor farmers to prosperity more specifically described the situation where members of the cooperative, based on improved understanding, promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity, absorbed 21 poor farm households from the entire village into the cooperative, helped them overcome difficulties, and guided everyone to "take the socialist road together well." This correctly implemented the policy of enabling all farmers to achieve common prosperity through mutual aid and cooperation.
    Because the Shanxi Daily specifically and prominently publicized the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, this publicity achieved better results. General readers believe that this publicity is more persuasive, more educational, and more suitable for the interests of farmers. Wang Jianxun, the Party branch secretary of Huyukou Village in the Seventh District of Ying County, wrote a letter to the newspaper saying that after reading the newspaper, he knew that many agricultural production cooperatives were stronger than mutual aid teams, and after listening to the report on the General Line and General Task, he was determined to discuss with all members of the mutual aid teams in the village to establish an agricultural production cooperative. At present, various places are actively implementing the Party Central Committee's resolution on developing agricultural production cooperatives in the winter agricultural production work. The Shanxi Daily uses popular and easy-to-understand methods that are easily accepted by farmers to educate farmers about the benefits of participating in agricultural production cooperatives, so that farmers are happy to participate in agricultural production cooperatives. This method is worthy of attention. Naturally, this does not mean that our newspapers can ignore the publicity of the primary form of mutual aid and cooperation—mutual aid teams—or ignore the political and production education of individual farmers. It should be understood that the purpose of publicizing the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives is precisely to attract the broad masses of farmers to tend towards socialism with concrete and practical examples; it is precisely to consolidate and develop agricultural production cooperatives and drive the great development of mutual aid and cooperation; it is precisely to encourage millions of people to actively embark on the bright road of mutual aid and cooperation and jointly strive to realize the country's socialist transformation of agriculture.

    具体地宣传农业生产合作社的优越性
    湜辛
    各地报纸向农民宣传总路线的重要经验之一，就是必须善于从农民的切身利益和实际经验出发，来教育农民认识党的号召和政策的正确性。我们的报纸要在广大农民群众走社会主义道路的积极性空前高涨的基础上，进一步引导农民发展互助合作组织，同样应该运用这个经验。由于农业生产合作社“方向好、产量高、收入多”，它在目前整个互助合作运动中日益显出重要的地位，并日益变成为党领导互助合作运动继续前进的重要环节，加强对农业生产合作社的宣传，就具有特别重大的意义。在这一方面，山西日报近两个多月来对农业互助合作特别是对农业生产合作社优越性的宣传，是一个良好的开端。
    要吸引农民积极参加互助合作，只能采取说服教育和典型示范的办法。“示范是在多方面的，但一切事情需要能够真正做到提高生产率，达到多产粮食或其他作物、增加收入这一个目的。只有在多产粮食增加收入这样的号召下，才可能动员农民组织起来。”（一九五三年二月公布的“中国共产党中央委员会关于农业生产互助合作的决议”）山西日报依据这一指示的精神，结合山西的实际情况，以巩固与发展农业生产合作社作为开展冬季农业生产的中心工作，从秋收分配的结果入手，突出地宣传了农业生产合作社的优越性。报纸一方面综合报道了一九五三年全省以及一个专区、一个县的农业生产合作社收获量较之单干农民和互助组显著增加的巨大成就，另一方面广泛介绍了不同地区、不同条件的农业生产合作社提高生产、增加收入的典型事例。例如，十一月三日报道的“武侯梨社今年‘四喜’齐来”，就说明平顺县武侯梨农业生产合作社由于发挥了集体经营的长处，全面地组织社员生产，不仅在农业生产方面，而且在林业、畜牧、副业生产方面都达到全面增产，因而社员收入大为增加。十一月二十一日报道的“赵城陈光亮农业社粮食打得多”，说明该社由于合理地使用了土地、劳力，提高了耕作技术，一九五三年每亩秋田平均打粮两石零四升八合，超过村里最好的陈光生互助组每亩平均产量一斗三升八合，比最好的单干农民陈九儿每亩多收三斗一升八合。十一月二十五日报道的“从三百六十三斤到五百三十三斤”，说明壶关县冯海科农业生产合作社虽处于大部是坡地和梯田的山区条件下，再加上连年有旱灾和洪灾的威胁，仍然连续三年增产，一九五三年的产量超过了抗日战争前生产水平的百分之二百九十五，比一九五○年还是互助组的时候提高了百分之九十七点四。报纸通过这些典型事例，不仅确切地证明了农业生产合作社能够比互助组和单干农民多打粮食，而且具体地揭示了它所以能多打粮食的原因，即由于农业生产合作社内部社会主义因素的增长，由于统一经营土地和统一使用劳力，从而便于解决生产资料的困难，便于改进和提高耕作技术，便于战胜各种自然灾害，这就能在相当的程度上克服小农经济的弱点，并能解决互助组中难以解决的一些矛盾。
    山西日报在大力宣传农业生产合作社增产粮食、增加社员收入的典型事例的同时，还有效地采用了农民“现身说法”的方式，以农民参加互助合作运动特别是参加农业生产合作社的亲身体验，来向农民进行自我教育。十一月八日发表的“‘四愁’变成四不怕”，就是通过浑源县许武乡农业生产合作社社员翟树权的自述，对单干和合作作了这样的比较：过去单干时由于劳力少因而有“四愁”——愁种、愁浇、愁锄、愁收；加入农业生产合作社后，“人多力量大，集体经营，处处做得周到”，种、浇、锄、收，再也不用愁了。十二月五日发表的武乡县禄村乡农业生产合作社社员张来元的来信，又说明老年农民张来元在土地改革中虽分到十八亩土地，但因年纪大，人手少，“年年不能按时下种，秋后总不能多打粮食”；一九五一年参加了互助组，解决了单干时的不少困难，“不但多打了粮食，而且也不像单干时那样忙忙乱乱地连口气也喘不过来了”；一九五二年冬天，他入了农业生产合作社后，不但能够从事适合自己体力的劳动，而且一年下来“比互助组多收入十三石（粮食），比单干时多收入十七石，全家生活大大地改善了”，因此张来元“决心永远听毛主席的话，跟着共产党走”。报纸发表的各地加入农业生产合作社的不同农户的亲身体验，既从多方面进一步阐明了农业生产合作社的优越性，又为广大农民树立了走互助合作道路达到共同富裕的生动榜样，这对于农民群众显然是一种实际而有效的教育。
    山西日报在宣传农业生产合作社的优越性时，还通过关于互助合作的专栏，运用事实对比和具体算账的方法，针对农民中对农业生产合作社的误解和怀疑，进行系统的分析批判。从十一月下旬以来，该报关于互助合作的专栏就曾连续而集中地批判了部分农民怕参加农业生产合作社“不自由”，劳力强、技术好的农民认为不搞互助合作一样能够提高生产，地多劳力少的农民顾虑入社后会吃亏，生产条件比较好、生活也比较富裕的农民企图单干发财等各种想法。报纸在进行这种批判时，都曾选择典型的人和典型的事来加以对比，并配合以“三言两语”的小言论。例如，十二月八日就曾以兴县石岭村白各嗟和猗氏县上朝村陈喜顺这两个劳力强、技术好的人，前者参加农业生产合作社而多分了粮食，后者退出农业生产合作社而少收了棉花的事实，来“给劳力强技术好的人算账”。事实证明，单干的困难很多，而农业生产合作社却能够克服单干所不能克服的许多困难，因而劳力强、技术高的人也只有参加农业生产合作社才能走向富裕；而且由于农业生产合作社以劳力分红为主，越是劳力强技术好的人越该入社来发挥自己的特长。十二月二十三日又以闻喜县五区东杜村的柴银锁和柴德洪这两个土地多劳力少的人，前者参加了农业生产合作社结果比往年多收入一千多斤粮食，后者入了社又退出来，结果比同样条件的社员农户少收二百多斤粮食的事实，来进行对比。报纸在分析了农业生产合作社统一经营土地因而能够做到“地尽其利”后，指出地多劳力少的农户参加农业生产合作社也是有利的。报纸通过具有说服力量的事实，来系统地解决农民中对农业生产合作社的各种误解和顾虑，也就更加深入而具体地显示了农业生产合作社优越性的各个方面。
    农业生产合作社不仅是一种比较先进的农业生产组织，也是党对农民进行现实的社会主义教育的学校。农业生产合作社的社员由于集体劳动和统一使用生产资料，有着较高的政治觉悟，他们不仅在生产上优于单干农民，而且在政治上也是农村中热烈响应党和政府各项号召、积极贯彻党和政府各项政策的基本力量。山西日报在宣传农业生产合作社的优越性时，没有忽视这一个重要的方面。报纸在购粮报道中，曾着重地宣扬了各地农业生产合作社社员认识到国家建设利益和个人利益的一致性从而带头出卖余粮的模范行动。十二月二十七日报道的大同县陈家庄农业生产合作社带领困难农民一同走向富裕，更具体地叙述了该社社员在认识提高的基础上，发扬互助友爱精神，吸收全村二十一户困难农民入社，帮助他们克服困难，引导大家“一同好好往社会主义走”的情况。这就正确地贯彻了使全体农民经过互助合作达到共同富裕的政策。
    由于山西日报具体而突出地宣传了农业生产合作社的优越性，就使得这一宣传收到较好的效果。一般读者认为这一宣传说服力比较强，教育意义比较大，适合农民的兴趣。应县七区胡峪口村党支部书记王建勋就写信给报社说，他看了报纸知道很多农业生产合作社都比互助组强，又听了总路线总任务的报告，决心和全村互助组组员商量，建立一个农业生产合作社。目前各地正在冬季农业生产工作中积极地贯彻党中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议。山西日报采用通俗易懂而为农民所容易接受的办法教育农民认识参加农业生产合作社的好处，使农民乐于参加农业生产合作社。这种办法是值得重视的。自然，这不是说我们的报纸可以忽视对互助合作的初级形式—互助组的宣传，或忽视对单干农民的政治教育和生产教育。应该了解，宣传农业生产合作社优越性的目的，正是为了以具体的实际的榜样来吸引广大农民倾向社会主义；正是为了巩固和发展农业生产合作社，并带动互助合作的大发展；正是为了鼓舞千百万群众积极走上互助合作的光明大道，来共同为实现国家对农业的社会主义改造而奋斗。
