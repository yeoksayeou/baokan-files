    Learning from the Most Beloved People
    Speech by Gao Xiuying, Model of Huai River Harnessing
    I participated in the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to express our regards to our most beloved people—the heroic Volunteer Army comrades. Before going abroad, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep for several nights, constantly thinking about how to meet the most beloved people and how to greet them.
    After arriving in Korea, the first time we met the Volunteer Army comrades, they grabbed our hands and affectionately called us family. At that moment, I was so moved that I shed tears. During the visit, the Volunteer Army leaders at all levels, down to every soldier, treated us like family.
    One day, we went to the famous "Dingzi Mountain" position to carry out our mission. I had heard about "Dingzi Mountain" in the motherland, how the American devils suffered a major defeat there, causing infighting and chaos within the imperialist ranks. This time, I was able to stand on the heroic position myself. I climbed to the top of a peak and saw that "Dingzi Mountain" was like a nail sticking into the enemy's position. The terrain was so dangerous, no wonder the devils were willing to risk everything to seize it. But they miscalculated; the heroic position was guarded by heroes, and the American devils met a bloody end.
    That afternoon, Chen Shouxin, a first-class meritorious Volunteer Army comrade, told me about the battle of "Dingzi Mountain." When he talked about how the American devils were beaten and fled in disgrace, he even imitated the way the devils ran away with their heads in their hands, which made me laugh and applaud so hard that tears came out of my eyes. Comrade Chen Shouxin wanted me to talk about my participation in the Huai River harnessing project. I said: At that time, whenever we encountered difficulties on the construction site, as long as we thought of the Volunteer Army, we could overcome any difficulty, no matter how great. I often said, "If your heart is hot, you are not afraid of the cold water," and that was the spirit the Volunteer Army gave me. I also said: Comrade Chen Shouxin, my work is not as good as yours, I want to learn from you, from the most beloved people, humbly. Finally, Comrade Chen Shouxin invited me to take a photo with him. While taking the photo, the comrades next to us said: This is meaningful, one is a hero of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the other is a model for building the motherland, both are good children of the motherland. I heard that Chen Shouxin had even met Chairman Mao when he returned to China on October 1, 1953, to attend the National Day celebrations. I secretly made up my mind that after returning to China, I must improve my mutual aid team and strive to meet Chairman Mao.
    I also visited the Volunteer Army comrades' residences on the mountain. The houses were built very well. In the past, during the war, the comrades lived in tunnels all day long, and there was not even a thatched hut on the mountain. Only after the armistice were many houses built, and a hall that could accommodate two hundred people was also built. The rooms were decorated beautifully, with slogans and pictures plastered all over the walls. The Volunteer Army comrades called it "Battlefield New Village." In the mountain valley, I also saw a well. Although it was simply dug, the name was very touching. The Volunteer Army comrades called it "Pearl Spring." Indeed, during the war, water was as precious as pearls. The name was perfectly chosen. In addition, there was a basketball court, which was called "Battlefield Playground." A clean kitchen also had a name, called "International Hotel." I also crawled into a large tunnel to visit. This tunnel was opened by the Volunteer Army comrades, one cone at a time. At that time, I thought: Our Volunteer Army comrades are really capable. They are heroes in battle, and now they are also excellent construction talents.
    When leaving "Dingzi Mountain," Comrade Chen Shouxin said to me: Dear Comrade Gao Xiuying, please tell the people of the motherland after you return to China, please rest assured that we are on the position. If the American aggressors dare to violate the armistice agreement and launch another war of aggression, we will definitely wipe them out in front of our position. These words burned in my heart like a fire. Heroes, with you, what can we not rest assured about? Rest assured, the construction of the motherland is up to us, and we will definitely build the motherland more beautiful and prosperous.
    One day, we went to the Martyrs' Cemetery to sweep the tombs. When I stood before the heroic martyrs who sacrificed their most precious lives for the independence and freedom of Korea, for the safety of the motherland, and for the defense of world peace, I felt both gratitude and heartache. Standing in front of the tombs of martyrs Feng Jilin and Chen Zhi, I seemed to see their heroic and immortal images. Feng Jilin, a hero in the style of Yang Gensi, in the critical moment of battle, detonated the explosive pack and charged into the enemy ranks, killing a large number of enemies, and bravely sacrificed himself, but finally held the mountain position. Chen Zhi, a brave and resourceful hero, stepped forward to replace the platoon leader after the platoon leader was sacrificed, leading the soldiers to defeat several counterattacks by the enemy and win victory, sacrificing himself gloriously. It is these immortal heroes who, with selfless sacrifice, have protected the gate of the motherland, protected the mothers and children of the motherland, ensured the successful progress of the Huai River harnessing project, and defended peace in the Far East and the world!
    One day, I was resting in the house when a comrade named Lu Bingrong stuffed a letter into my hand. I asked someone else to read it to me. The letter said: He was very grateful that the people of the motherland sent a delegation to express their regards. He assured the people of the motherland that he would never slacken his fighting spirit, would strengthen his vigilance, and would strive to make contributions in his future work and study. He also said that he would learn from my model deeds and would never bow his head to difficulties. Receiving such a letter, no, a letter of determination from an ordinary soldier, how could you not be moved? I immediately asked other comrades to help me write a reply, signed my name, and personally handed it to Comrade Lu Bingrong. I proposed to participate more actively in the construction of the motherland to answer Comrade Lu Bingrong. Comrade Lu Bingrong's determination represents the determination of millions of Volunteer Army comrades.
    I, a rural girl, came to the Korean battlefield to express my regards to the most beloved people. I did too little work. But in a short few dozen days, I have gained a lot. I thank the Party for cultivating me, and I thank the most beloved people for their education and encouragement. I want to learn from our most beloved people, I guarantee to improve my mutual aid team, study the principles of the national general line, educate the peasant masses around me to take the road to common prosperity, and enter socialist society together in the future. I guarantee to study culture well. I guarantee to maintain the honor of a model Youth League member.

### 向最可爱的人学习

    向最可爱的人学习
    治淮模范　高秀英讲
    我参加了中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团，到朝鲜慰问了我们最可爱的人——英雄的志愿军同志。在出国之前，我兴奋得几个夜晚睡不着觉，直惦念着怎样和最可爱的人见面，怎样向他们问好。
    到了朝鲜以后，我们第一次和志愿军同志会见的时候，他们拉住我们的手，亲热地管我们叫亲人。当时我激动得流出眼泪来。在慰问的过程中，志愿军的各级首长一直到每一个战士，都把我们当亲人看待。
    有一天，我们到著名的“丁字山”阵地上进行慰问工作。“丁字山”，我在祖国时就听人说过，美国鬼子在那里吃了一次大败仗，弄得帝国主义内部狗咬狗，混乱一团。这次，我可亲身站在英雄阵地上了。我爬到一个高峰头上一看，原来“丁字山”像根钉子一样伸到敌人阵地里，地势是那样险要，难怪鬼子要拚上血本来抢占。可是他算计错了，英雄阵地有英雄守，美国鬼子碰了个头破血流。
    那天下午，志愿军一等功臣陈守信同志向我讲了“丁字山”战斗的情况。他说到把美国鬼子打得狼狈逃跑的时候，还学鬼子抱头鼠窜的样子，我乐得直拍手，把眼泪都笑出来了。陈守信同志要我讲讲参加治淮的情况。我说：那时我们在工地上，一逢到困难，只要想到志愿军，天大的困难也能克服了。我常说“心热不怕水冷”，这就是志愿军给我的一股劲头。我又说：陈守信同志，我的工作比不上你，我要好好地向你、向最可爱的人虚心地学习。最后，陈守信同志邀我和他合拍了一张照片。拍照片时，同志们在旁边说：这可有意义了，一个是抗美援朝的功臣，一个是建设祖国的模范，都是祖国的好儿女。我听说陈守信在一九五三年十月一日归国观礼时还见到过毛主席呢。我暗暗地下了决心，回国之后，一定把我的互助组搞好，争取去见毛主席。
    我又在山上参观了志愿军同志的住屋，那些房屋可盖得好。过去打仗的时候，同志们整天住坑道，山上一座茅屋也没有，停战后才盖上许多房子，还修了一个可以容纳两百人的礼堂。房间里布置得很漂亮，标语、画片贴满墙壁，志愿军同志称它为“战地新村”。在山沟里，我还看到一个水井，虽然挖得简单，名字倒很动人，志愿军同志都叫它是“珍珠泉”。的确是这样，过去打仗时，吃水就如珍珠一样的宝贵，这名字取得对极了。此外，还有篮球场，它被叫做“战地操场”。一个干净的厨房，也有个名字，叫做“国际饭店”。我还钻进大坑道去参观，这坑道是志愿军同志一锥一锥开出来的。当时我想：咱们志愿军同志真能干，打起仗来是英雄，现在又是出色的建设人材。
    离开“丁字山”的时候，陈守信同志对我说：亲爱的高秀英同志，请你回国后告诉祖国人民，请祖国人民放心，阵地上有我们在，美国侵略者如果胆敢破坏停战协定，再发动侵略战争，我们一定把他们歼灭在我们阵地前面。这句话就像一把火烧在我的心里。英雄们，有了你们，我们还有什么不能放心的。你们也放心罢，祖国的建设有我们，我们一定将祖国建设得更美丽更富强。
    有一天，我们去烈士陵园扫墓。当我站在为朝鲜的独立自由、为祖国的安全、为保卫世界和平而献出最宝贵的生命的英雄烈士面前时，我又感激又心痛。我站在烈士冯吉林和陈志的墓前，就好像看到他们英雄的不朽的形象一样。杨根思式的英雄冯吉林，在战斗紧要关头，拉响了爆破筒，冲向敌群，炸死了大批敌人，自己也壮烈牺牲，但终于守住了山头阵地。英勇机智的英雄陈志，在排长牺牲之后，挺身而出接替排长，指挥战士们打垮了敌人数次的反扑，获得了胜利，自己光荣牺牲了。是这些不朽的英雄，以忘我的牺牲，保住了祖国的大门，保护了祖国的母亲和小孩，保证了治淮工程的胜利进行，保卫了远东和世界的和平！
    有一天，我正在房子里休息，一位名叫陆炳荣的同志塞给我一封信。我请别人念给我听。信上说：祖国人民派遣慰问团慰问他们，使他十分感激，他向祖国人民提出保证，决不松懈斗志，一定加强戒备，提高警惕，在今后工作中、学习中争取立功，并且还说向我的模范事迹学习，决不向困难低头。拿到这样的信，不，这是一个普通战士的决心书，你能不感动吗？我马上请别的同志帮我写了回信，自己签上名，亲自交给了陆炳荣同志。我提出一定更加积极参加祖国建设来回答陆炳荣同志。陆炳荣同志的决心，代表了千百万志愿军同志的决心。
    我，一个农村的姑娘，来到朝鲜战场上慰问最可爱的人，工作做得太少了。但是在短短的几十天中，我的收获是很大的。我感谢党对我的培养，感谢最可爱的人对我的教育和鼓励。我要向我们最可爱的人学习，我保证搞好我的互助组，学习国家总路线的道理，教育我周围的农民群众走大家富裕的道路，将来共同进入社会主义社会。我保证好好地学习文化。我保证保持模范青年团员的荣誉。
