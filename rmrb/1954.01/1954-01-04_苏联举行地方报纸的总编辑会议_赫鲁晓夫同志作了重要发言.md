Editor's Note: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a conference of chief editors of newspapers from various states, border regions, and republics from November 19 to December 2, 1953. The conference discussed and exchanged experiences on how newspapers and periodicals could fight to implement the "Measures for Further Developing Soviet Agriculture" of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee. Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, also made an important speech on this issue. This speech is of great significance not only to Soviet newspapers and periodicals but also to our country's agricultural production propaganda. Today, this newspaper specially translates and publishes the news about this conference and the article "Practical Experience of the Party in Leading Newspapers and Periodicals" written by Comrade Tretyakova, Secretary of the Moscow State Committee of the CPSU, here for the reference of party committees and newspapers and periodicals in various places.

From November 19th to December 2nd, a conference of chief editors and heads of agricultural groups of newspapers from various states, border regions, and republics, convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, was held in Moscow.

Comrades N.S. Khrushchev and P.N. Pospelov, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, attended the meeting.

The conference heard and discussed the following reports: Comrade V.S. Kruzhkov, Minister of Propaganda and Agitation Department of the CPSU Central Committee, made a report entitled "The September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee on Improving Party's Political Work in Rural Areas," Comrade D.T. Shepilov, Editor-in-Chief of "Pravda," made a report on "The Tasks of Newspapers and Periodicals in the Struggle to Implement the Resolution of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee on 'Measures for Further Developing Soviet Agriculture,'" Comrade V.V. Matskevich, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Soviet Union, made a report on "Measures for Implementing the Resolution of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee on Developing Animal Husbandry," and Comrade P.S. Kuchumov made a report on "Further Improving the Work of Machine Tractor Stations and Strengthening Their Role in Developing Collective Farm Production," Comrade A.Kh. Anastasov, Director of the General Administration of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Soviet Union, made a report entitled "The Status Quo and Development Prospects of Cotton Planting in the Soviet Union."

The chief editors exchanged experiences in elaborating on the most important tasks of developing agriculture in newspapers and made discussions.

The conference also heard many other reports.

Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, spoke at the meeting.

In his speech, Comrade Khrushchev talked about the task of struggling to implement the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee and emphasized the great role of the Soviet newspapers and periodicals in implementing the measures of the Party and the government on further developing agriculture.

Our country possesses inexhaustible potential to develop all agricultural sectors as quickly as possible, so as to fully guarantee the supply of grain to residents and raw materials to light industry in the next few years. The whole problem lies in exploring these possibilities and potentials and organizing the struggle to fully utilize them. Our newspapers and periodicals are faced with a major and multifaceted work in this regard.

Party organizations and agricultural organs have launched a great work to implement the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee. However, some major shortcomings have not yet been eliminated. In many states, the tasks of developing animal husbandry and ensuring the supply of feed for livestock are not being completed satisfactorily, and the construction of livestock sheds is lagging behind. It should be admitted that the work of rearranging work according to the requirements put forward by the September Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee is proceeding slowly.

Newspapers and magazines often report that all the tasks put forward by the Central Committee Plenary Session have been completed. This magnanimous attitude can only harm the work. Active struggle against shortcomings should be carried out.

The main part of Comrade Khrushchev's speech was about the work of cadres. He instructed that newspapers and periodicals' elaboration on how various localities select engineers, agronomists, and livestock breeders for machine tractor stations and collective farms is weak and powerless. The work of selecting truly outstanding personnel with the ability to lead agricultural production to rural areas still requires a lot of work from Party organizations. Many republics, border regions, and state newspapers talk about this matter in a pleasant tone. Newspapers write more about the number of experts and other staff sent to rural areas, but they are usually silent about who these people are, and whether these people can provide practical help to collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms.

We also have some staff who treat agriculture in an aristocratic way. They do not understand the significance and importance of the Party's efforts to vigorously improve agriculture. Newspapers and periodicals should expose this harmful sentiment of lordly contempt for the needs of collective farms and machine tractor stations.

Party organizations do not care enough about collective farm chairmen. It should be known that the collective farm chairman is the main and decisive figure in collective farm production. Those who live up to the trust of the collective farmers and can correctly implement the Party's policies in rural areas should be promoted to lead the collective farms. The talent and maturity of the district committee secretary and his ability to lead the masses are manifested first of all in his ability to select those capable and good public economic organizers to be collective farm chairmen. Unfortunately, it should be pointed out that Party organizations are not doing a good job in selecting collective farm chairmen. The criticism of the shortcomings in this work by newspapers is weak. They often only report on the best collective farm chairmen, which is necessary. But the bad thing is that newspapers do not expose the shortcomings in the work of selecting collective farm chairmen, and they tolerate the situation in which unqualified and misbehaving staff are recommended to the position of collective farm chairman in many cases. The leading link of the district - the Party's district committee and the district executive committee - needs to be strengthened seriously.

The role of newspapers and periodicals in all our work is huge. In order to successfully complete this task, newspaper and magazine staff should study the essence of the problems provided by life more deeply, and should write about these problems deeply and specifically. Newspapers should expose the shortcomings in our work extremely sharply, expose shortcomings, and at the same time mobilize people to overcome these shortcomings and encourage the broad masses of working people to carry out healthy criticism.

Some newspapers sometimes publish articles that are colorful. If you look at the titles, it seems that the newspapers have all kinds of problems, but in essence, there is almost nothing. If you try to tell the editor-in-chief of this newspaper that he has not elaborated on a certain issue, then he will answer you that this is not true, and will immediately point out some titles and some articles on this issue. But if you don't understand what the purpose of the editorial department is, and what the intention of the editorial department is when publishing an article or a communication, then will you get a lot of benefits from these articles? Will these articles be of great significance? If the editorial department has decided to make a statement on an important issue, it should study the issue deeply so that the articles published in the newspaper are serious and reliable, attract attention, and benefit the collective farm chairman, the production team leader, and anyone who really cares about agriculture. What is required of the editor-in-chief is to be good at correctly selecting staff, and to be good at absorbing knowledgeable people who understand how to complete the task to participate in the work of newspapers or magazines. We must be good at discovering thinkers and be good at using the experience accumulated by the people.

When elaborating on agricultural issues, the editorial departments of many newspapers and magazines do not often consider the local conditions of different regions in the country. For example, we have talked a lot about the square cluster planting method. This is good. But the bad thing is that it is often said as if it should be used in the same way in all regions of the Soviet Union, and the size of the square should also be the same, without considering the characteristics of the soil and other natural conditions. This is not understanding life. The same is true for many other issues. Newspaper and magazine staff should be familiar with and deeply study the issues they are writing about. Boasting and pursuing sensational rhetoric hinders many of our newspapers. Of course, we should be good at marking an article with an eye-catching title, so that the title has the power to mobilize; but we must remember this unchanging rule: the title must be consistent with the content of the article, and the manuscripts in the newspaper must be convincing and based on evidence. What is required of newspaper staff is to be good at selecting informative, vivid, interesting and exemplary manuscripts. We must resolutely eradicate deep-rooted stereotypes, rigid standards, and the problem of writing everything in the same style from newspapers. Some newspapers have begun to report on the work of two collective farms by comparing them. This is a good method. But we should diversify the manuscripts, and we should consider both the content and the form of the articles published in newspapers and magazines.

Newspaper staff should always remember that the accuracy and reliability of the facts, the truthfulness of the phenomena and events written about, the vivid and symbolic language, and the various forms of manuscripts are of great significance to the success of newspaper work.

In his speech, Comrade Khrushchev pointed out serious shortcomings and errors in many newspapers, especially: "Kursk Truth," "Workers' Road" (Smolensk), "Bryansk Worker," "Agricultural Newspaper" and "Literary Gazette."

There are also great shortcomings in agricultural magazines. Many editors-in-chief and editorial boards of agricultural magazines have not shown real concern for the cause entrusted to them. The Ministry of Agriculture underestimated the role of newspapers and periodicals and did not regularly guide the work of its various magazine editorial departments.

Comrade Khrushchev said that we have no more powerful and effective weapon than our newspapers and periodicals. Newspapers and periodicals are the ideological weapons of our Party with the longest range. If we can select manuscripts well for newspapers and magazines, we can hit targets tens of thousands of kilometers away, and we can expose the shortcomings in every corner of our vast motherland. Therefore, whoever underestimates the role of newspapers and periodicals weakens our strength.

We should report on agriculture more deeply, more meaningfully, and more skillfully, and explain the implementation of the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee.

Secondly, Comrade Khrushchev talked about the tasks of newspapers and periodicals in the struggle to implement the resolutions of the Party and the government on further developing industry, especially the resolution on greatly expanding the production of daily necessities. He used some concrete examples and facts to illustrate how huge the potential of our factories is to increase production speed and expand production volume. The task is to discover new potential for expanding the production of industrial products, not by expanding production sites, but by improving production technology and using equipment more rationally. In carrying out this task, it is important to constantly rely on the experience of advanced workers and their advanced working methods, to more widely launch a socialist competition to complete and overfulfill plans, to improve the quality of products as much as possible, and to give full play to the creative initiative of the masses. In this regard, newspapers and periodicals can and should give invaluable help to Party organizations.

Criticism in newspapers and periodicals is the most effective criticism. We must rebuke in newspapers those staff who treat the material needs of the Soviet people with a bureaucratic attitude, and rebuke those staff who produce products of poor quality. More attention should be paid to the issues of working people's lives, and the progress of housing construction, the distribution of housing, the production of daily necessities, and the organization of trade should be elaborated in newspapers and periodicals. We must never tolerate things like the phenomenon that there are sometimes no children's felt boots and other necessities in the stores. This is not the result of negligence, but the most vivid consequence of the stupidity of those staff who are not competent for their jobs. Newspapers and periodicals have the responsibility to help Party organizations and Soviet organs eliminate and eradicate shortcomings and oppose bureaucracy and carelessness in all our work.

The Party's political work is the foundation of the foundation of our economic achievements. In order to engage in the struggle to produce goods, we should organize those who produce these goods. We should improve the level of all activities of Party organizations and improve the level of Party propaganda and ideological work. The consolidation of Party organizations and ideological unity are very important.

In conclusion, Comrade Khrushchev said that we have all the basis and all the conditions to successfully complete the great task of communist construction. We possess inexhaustible natural resources. The Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and its Central Committee, under the leadership of Lenin, and under the leadership of Stalin after Lenin's death, have accumulated great experience in socialist construction. Our responsibility is to rely on these experiences, use them rationally, expand achievements, and move quickly towards the road of building a communist society.

    苏联举行地方报纸的总编辑会议
    赫鲁晓夫同志作了重要发言
    编者按：苏联共产党中央委员会在一九五三年十一月十九日到十二月二日举行了各州、各边疆区和各共和国报纸的总编辑会议。会议上讨论和交流了报刊怎样为实现苏共中央九月全会“关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施”而斗争的经验。苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志并就这一问题作了重要发言。这个发言不只对苏联报刊，而且对我国报刊的农业生产宣传也有极大的意义。今天本报特将有关这一会议的消息和苏共莫斯科州委会书记特列琪雅科娃所写的“关于党领导报刊的实际经验”一文译出刊载在这里，以供各地党委和报刊参考。
    从十一月十九日起到十二月二日，在莫斯科举行了由苏联共产党中央委员会召开的各州、各边疆区和各共和国报纸的总编辑和农业组组长的会议。
    苏联共产党中央委员会书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志和彼·纳·波斯伯洛夫同志参加了会议。
    会议听取并讨论了下列报告：苏共中央宣传鼓动部部长维·斯·克鲁热科夫同志所作以“苏共中央九月全会关于改善农村党的政治工作”为题的报告，“真理报”总编辑德·特·谢比洛夫同志的报告“报刊在为实现苏共中央九月全会‘关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施’这一决议的斗争中的任务”，苏联农业部副部长伏·伏·马茨凯维奇同志所作“关于执行苏共中央九月全会有关发展饲畜业的决议的措施”和普·斯·库楚莫夫同志所作“进一步改善机器拖拉机站的工作和加强其在发展集体农庄生产中的作用”的报告，苏联农业部总管理处处长阿·赫·阿纳斯塔索夫同志所作以“苏联植棉业的现状和发展远景”为题的报告。
    总编辑们交换了在报纸上阐述发展农业的最重要的任务的经验，并作了讨论。
    会议还听取了许多其他报告。
    苏共中央书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志曾在会议上发言。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在发言中谈到了为实现苏共中央九月全会决议的斗争任务，并强调指出苏联报刊在实现党和政府关于进一步发展农业的措施方面的巨大作用。
    我国拥有取之不竭的潜力来尽快地发展一切农业部门，以使在最近几年内充分保证居民的粮食供应和轻工业的原料，全部问题在于把这些可能性和潜力发掘出来，组织为充分利用它们的斗争。我们的报刊在这方面就面临着一个重大而多方面的工作。
    党组织和农业机关展开了执行中央委员会九月全体会议的决议的巨大工作。但是有一些重大缺点至今还没有消灭。在许多州里，发展饲畜业和保证牲畜的饲料供应的任务，完成得不能令人满意，建造牲畜棚的工作是落后的。应该承认，根据党中央九月全会所提出的要求来重新安排工作，是进行得迟缓的。
    报纸和杂志时常这样报道：中央委员会全体会议所提出的一切任务都已完成了。这种宽宏大量的态度，只能使工作遭受损害。应当与缺点进行积极的斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫同志发言中的主要部分是谈对干部的工作。他指示说，报刊对于各地如何为机器拖拉机站和集体农庄选拔工程师、农学家、牲畜饲养家的工作，阐述得是软弱无力的。把真正优秀的、有领导农业生产能力的工作人员选送到农村去的这件工作，还需要党组织做很多工作。许多共和国、边疆区和州的报纸是用一种愉快的声调来谈论这件事的。报纸写得比较多的是派往农村去的专家和其他工作人员的数字，但是，它们对于派去了的是那些人，这些人是不是能够对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场有实际的帮助，通常却默而不言。
    我们还有一些贵族式地对待农业的工作人员，他们不理解党所实行的大力提高农业的工作的意义和重要性。报刊应当揭露这种老爷式地蔑视地对待集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的需求的有害情绪。
    党组织对于集体农庄主席的关怀是不够的。要知道集体农庄主席是集体农庄生产中主要的、决定性的人物。应当提拔那些不辜负集体农民信任的，能够正确执行党在农村中的政策的人来领导集体农庄。区委会书记的才干和成熟性、他领导群众的能力的表现，首先是在善于选拔那些有能力的、那些好的公共经济的组织者来做集体农庄主席。可惜，应该指出，党组织对于选拔集体农庄主席的工作做得不好。报纸对这件工作的缺点的批评是软弱的。它们时常只报道些最好的集体农庄主席，这是需要做的。但是不好的是，报纸不揭露在选拔集体农庄主席工作中的缺点，对于在许多场合下那些不合格的、曾经误过事的工作人员被推荐到集体农庄主席的职位上去的情况，采取容忍态度。区的领导环节——党的区委会和区执行委员会——需要认真地予以加强。
    报刊在我们全部工作中的作用是巨大的。为了成功地完成这个任务，报纸和杂志工作人员应当更深入研究生活所提供的问题的本质，应当深谙事理地、具体地写出这些问题。报纸应当异常尖锐地揭露我们工作中的缺点，暴露缺点，同时应当动员人们克服这些缺点，鼓舞广大的劳动群众开展健康的批评。
    一些报纸有时发表的稿件是五光十色的，如果从标题上来看，好像报纸上各种问题都有，可是实质上几乎是什么都没有。如果你试着告诉这个报纸的总编辑说，他没有阐述某个问题，那么他会回答你，这是不对的，并且会立刻指出一些标题，指出关于这个问题的一些文章。但是如果不明白编辑部的目的是什么，编辑部在发表某篇文章或通讯时的意图如何，那末从这些文章里会得到很多的好处吗？这些文章会有很大的意义吗？如果编辑部已决定对某个重要问题发表言论，它就应当深刻地去研究这个问题，以使报上发表的稿件是严正可靠的，引人注意的，使集体农庄主席、生产队长和任何一个真正关心农业的人得到益处的。要求总编辑的，就是善于正确选拔工作人员，善于把那些明白应当如何完成任务的有学识的人吸收来参加报纸或杂志的工作。应当善于发现会思考的人，善于运用人民所积累起来的经验。
    许多报纸和杂志的编辑部在阐述农业问题的时候，不是常常考虑到国内各不同地区的当地条件。例如，关于播种的方形簇种法，我们已谈得不少了。这是好的。但是不好的是时常说得好像是苏联一切地区都应当同样使用它，并且方形的大小也应当是一样，而不去考虑土壤和其他自然条件的特性。这就是不懂得生活。关于许多其他问题也有同样情况。报纸和杂志的工作人员应当熟知和深刻研究他们所写的问题。大吹大擂，追求喧嚣的词藻妨害了我们许多报纸。当然，应当善于为文章标上一个引人注意的题目，使这个标题有动员的力量；但是必须记住这个不变的规则：标题要符合文章的内容，报上的稿件要有说服力，要有根据。要求报纸工作人员的，就是善于选择有内容的、生动的、有趣的和可资借镜的稿件。必须坚决从报纸上铲除掉根深柢固的陈规旧套、刻板标准，写什么都是按照一个样式的毛病，有些报纸已开始用对比的方法来报道两个集体农庄的工作。这是一个好方法。但是应当使稿件多样化，对于发表在报纸和杂志上的文章，既要多考虑它们的内容，也要多考虑它们的形式。
    报纸工作人员应该时时刻刻记住，事实的确实可靠、所写的现象和事件的真实性、生动的和象征的语言、各样形式的稿件，对于报纸工作的成功是有重大的意义的。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在他的发言中指出了许多报纸中的严重缺点和错误，特别是：“库尔斯克真理报”、“工人之路报”（斯摩棱斯克）、“布良斯克工人报”、“农业报”和“文学报”。
    农业杂志中也有很大的缺点，许多农业杂志的总编辑和编委会对于委托给他们的事业没有表现出真正的关怀。农业部对报刊的作用是估计不足的，没有经常地指导它的各杂志编辑部的工作。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说道，我们没有再比我们报刊更有力的、更有效的武器了。报刊是我们党的射程最远的思想武器。如果我们能为报纸和杂志很好地选择稿件，我们就能射中几万公里以外的目标，就能揭露我们的辽阔祖国各个角落的缺点。所以，谁对报刊的作用估计不足，谁就削弱我们的力量。
    应当更深入地、更富有内容地、深谙事理地报道农业，说明苏共中央九月全会的决议的执行情况。
    其次，赫鲁晓夫同志谈到报刊在实现党和政府关于进一步发展工业的决议，特别是大量扩大日用品生产的决议的斗争中的任务。他用一些具体的例子和事实来说明我们工厂拥有提高生产速度和扩大生产额的如何巨大的潜力。任务在于发现扩大工业品产额的新的潜力，不是用扩大生产场地的办法，而是用改善生产技术和更合理地使用设备的方法。在执行这个任务时，重要的是要经常依靠先进工作者的经验和他们的先进的工作方法，更广泛地展开争取完成和超额完成计划的社会主义竞赛，尽量提高生产品的质量，广泛地发挥群众的创造的主动性。在这方面，报刊是可以而且应当给党组织以不可估价的帮助。
    报刊中的批评是最有实效的批评。必须在报纸上斥责那些以官僚主义的态度对待苏联人民的物质生活需要的工作人员，斥责那些生产质量低劣的产品的工作人员。对于劳动人民生活的问题应多加注意，在报刊上要阐述住宅建筑的进程、住宅的分配、日用品的生产和贸易的组织。决不能容忍这样的事，例如有时商店里没有儿童毡靴和其他必需品的现象。这不是疏忽的结果，这是那些不能胜任工作的工作人员愚蠢的最鲜明的后果。报刊有责任帮助党组织和苏维埃机关消灭和根除缺点，反对我们一切工作中的官僚主义和粗枝大叶的作风。
    党的政治工作就是我们经济成就的基础的基础。为了要从事生产物品的斗争，那就应当把那些生产这些物品的人组织起来。应当提高党组织的一切活动的水平，提高党的宣传和思想工作的水平。党组织的巩固和思想上的团结一致是很重要的。
      赫鲁晓夫同志在结语时说道，我们有顺利完成共产主义建设的伟大任务的一切根据，一切条件。我们拥有取之不竭的天然资源。苏联人民在共产党及其中央委员会的领导下，在列宁领导下，列宁逝世后在斯大林的领导下，曾经积累了巨大的社会主义建设经验。我们的职责，就是依靠着这些经验，合理地使用它们，扩大成就，快速向建设共产主义社会的道路前进。　（塔斯社消息摘要，刘竞译）
