The North China Cooperatives General Association will increase the supply of chemical fertilizers to farmers in North China by more than 40% this year compared to last year; the supply of iron hoes will be more than six times that of last year, totaling 1.5 million; the supply of pig iron and other steel raw materials for handicrafts production cooperatives in various regions to manufacture agricultural tools will reach 9,000 tons, compared to only 300 tons last year; the supply of iron wire and iron nails will also be more than double that of last year. In addition, more than ten new varieties have been added this year, including iron pots, iron sieves, kitchen knives, bamboo broom seedlings, hacksaw blades, and wheel rims. The reserve of pesticides for seed mixing, such as Sanlisa and 666 insecticides, will be no less than last year. The supply of these production materials has been included in the 1954 supply plan of the North China Cooperatives General Association.

Currently, the North China Cooperatives General Association has begun allocation. 6,000 tons of chemical fertilizers have been allocated to various regions in early January, and another 9,000 tons of chemical fertilizers are currently being transported.

To ensure a steady supply of production materials to the countryside, the North China Cooperatives General Association has signed annual processing, ordering, and sales agreements with nine private iron pot factories in Tianjin; signed a sales contract with Tianjin United No. 7 Machine Factory for 640,000 iron hoes in 1954; and signed a contract with relevant private factories to order 45,000 iron sieves in the first quarter.

    华北合作总社今年将大力供应农村生产资料
    华北合作总社今年供应华北各地农民的化学肥料将比去年增加百分之四十强；铁铣相当于去年的六倍多，有一百五十万张；供给各地手工业生产合作社制造农具用的生铁等各种钢铁原料达九千吨，而去年仅三百多吨；铁丝、铁钉也比去年多两倍。此外，今年并增加了铁锅、铁筛子、菜刀、竹扫帚苗、锯条、车圈等十多种新品种。拌种用的散力赛、六六六杀虫剂等农药，今年的储备量都不低于去年。这些生产资料的供应都已列入华北合作总社一九五四年的供应计划。
    目前，华北合作总社已开始调拨。一月上旬调到各地的化学肥料已有六千吨，最近又有九千吨化学肥料正在调运中。
    为保证生产资料源源供应农村，华北合作总社已和天津市九家私营铁锅厂签订了全年的加工、订货、包销协议；和天津联合第七机器厂订了一九五四年六十四万张铁铣的包销合同；和有关私营工厂签订了第一季度订购四万五千个铁筛子的合同。
