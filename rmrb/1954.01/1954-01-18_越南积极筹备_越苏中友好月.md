Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 16th: The Central Organizing Committee of Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month has sent a delegation to the Fourth Inter-zone in northern Vietnam to report to the people of that region their impressions during their visits to fraternal countries. This delegation includes Nguyen Cong Hoa, head of the Vietnamese Trade Union Delegation to the Third World Trade Union Congress; delegation member Tran Anh Lien; Zheng Chunpei, a Vietnamese agricultural labor model who recently returned from the International Conference of Agricultural and Forestry Workers; Huang Wenliao (transliteration), a combat hero and member of the Vietnamese delegation to the World Youth and Students Peace and Friendship Festival in Bucharest; as well as Vietnamese combat heroes and other individuals who have visited the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries. Another delegation with the same mission has also been sent to the Viet Bac Inter-zone in northern Vietnam.

At the same time, local governments and people's organizations throughout Vietnam have established local organizing committees for the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month. The Vietnam People's Army has also formed "organizing committees" in each regiment and is actively preparing for the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 15th: Many famous combat heroes and labor models in Vietnam have successively made speeches to welcome the upcoming Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month.

Giap Van Khang, a national combat hero of Vietnam who just returned from the Fourth World Youth and Students Peace and Friendship Festival in Bucharest, said that this friendship month is a good opportunity for our people to understand more deeply the situation of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, learn from their valuable experience, and strengthen our people's confidence in the final victory of the resistance war. As for myself, I am willing to tell everyone everything I have seen in fraternal countries.

Huang Wenliao (transliteration), a combat hero from South Vietnam, said that our compatriots in South Vietnam are eager to know the achievements and happy life of the people of the Soviet Union and China. In the past, due to the war, it was difficult for them to know these situations; now that the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month is about to come, our compatriots in South Vietnam will be very happy to see newspapers, pictorials, pictures, and movies introducing fraternal countries, and hear about the situation of fraternal countries.

Le Quang Toan, a national industrial labor model of Vietnam, said, "After returning to China, I went to many factories, rural areas, and schools to report on the work of the Fourth World Youth and Students Peace and Friendship Festival in Bucharest, and told them everything I saw in Romania, Poland, and other people's democratic countries. I told them about the happy lives of the people of the Soviet Union and China. The audience told me: 'We don't feel tired at all listening to your report. We can listen to you for days and nights.' This can explain why I was so happy when I learned about the holding of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month. I believe our compatriots must also be happy about this news."

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 16th: Vietnamese nationals within Yunnan Province are responding to the call of the Central Organizing Committee of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month and are enthusiastically carrying out various preparations for the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month.

Vietnamese nationals residing in Kunming, Kaiyuan, Yiliang, Qujing, Mengzi, Gejiu, and other counties (cities) will hold grand gatherings on January 18th. During the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, Vietnamese nationals will also hold report meetings, seminars, and photo exhibitions to introduce the situation of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries and publicize the achievements of Vietnam's resistance war, in order to deepen the internationalist spirit of Vietnamese nationals and encourage their enthusiasm for supporting the resistance war.

    【新华社十六日讯】据越南通讯社十五日讯：越苏中友好月中央组织委员会派出一个代表团到中越北部的第四联区去，向该地区人民报告他们在访问各兄弟国家期间的观感。这个代表团包括有出席世界工会第三次代表大会越南工会代表团团长阮功和、团员陈英莲，参加国际农林工人会议后刚回国的越南农业劳动模范郑春沛，以及越南参加布加勒斯特世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节代表团团员、战斗英雄黄文缭（译音），以及曾经访问过苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的越南战斗英雄和其他人士。另一个负有同样使命的代表团也已派到越南北部的越北联区去。

    【新华社十七日讯】据越南通讯社十五日讯：越南许多著名的战斗英雄和劳动模范纷纷发表谈话，迎接即将到来的越苏中友好月。
    参加布加勒斯特第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节后刚回来的越南全国战斗英雄甲文康说，这个友好月对于我国人民说来是一个良好的机会，使我们可以更深刻地了解苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的情况，学习它们宝贵的经验和加强我国人民对抗战最后胜利的信心。至于我自己，我愿意把我在兄弟国家所看到的一切都告诉大家。
    南越的一位战斗英雄黄文缭（译音）说，我们在南越的同胞迫切想知道苏联和中国人民的成就和幸福生活。过去由于战争，他们很难知道这些情况；现在，越苏中友好月就要来临了，我们在南越的同胞一定会很高兴地看到关于介绍各兄弟国家的报纸、画报、图片和电影，并听到关于兄弟国家的情况。
    越南全国工业劳动模范黎光全说，我回国以后曾到过许多工厂、农村和学校，报告了布加勒斯特第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的工作，并向他们谈到我在罗马尼亚、波兰和其他人民民主国家所看到的一切。我告诉他们，苏联和中国人民的幸福生活。听众们告诉我说：听你的报告，我们一点也不觉得疲倦。我们可以听你讲几天几夜。这可以说明为什么我在知道举行越苏中友好月时，我是那么的高兴。我相信我们的同胞一定也为这个消息而高兴。
