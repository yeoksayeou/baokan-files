    An All-Encompassing Summary Outline
    Shi Yan
    On December 25th of last year, the Wuhan Municipal Mechanical Industry Party Committee Office issued a notice to all machinery factories, requiring each factory to summarize the work of the year, and pointed out: "If a factory is perfunctory and hasty in its response, it will not be able to continue to overcome the chaotic phenomena in the enterprise, and will not be able to move forward faster." This is very true, but how to summarize? Attached to the notice was a summary outline.
    This outline has five major parts, each part is divided into several sections, and each section is further divided into several questions, some of which have five or six sub-questions. The entire outline has fifteen sections and one hundred and seventy-two large and small questions, plus statistical figures such as technical and economic indicators, totaling more than two hundred detailed items.
    The content includes production status, increased production and economy, work plan, production scheduling, the system of one-chief responsibility, departmental work, changing leadership style, labor emulation, learning production business knowledge, promoting worker cadres, labor wages, technical management, and so on. The statistics involve indicators such as product output, total production value, total commodity value, labor productivity, equilibrium rate of major products, profits turned over to the state, quality of major products, work-related injuries, and product costs, totaling nine types. It also requires summarizing "the various technical and economic indicators in each quarter and each month throughout the year, and how much was actually completed?" There should also be a "percentage table of planned versus actual."
    In order to complete and enrich such a complex summary content, the notice also requires responsible comrades of each Party committee and factory directors to personally take action and organize forces to conduct the summary; the summary should not contain empty talk, but should compare good and bad situations; do not summarize in a general and vague manner,.... Moreover, the summary period was stipulated to be very short, requiring a formal summary to be written and submitted to the Mechanical Industry Party Committee by January 7th.
    Two hundred questions, a series of requirements, looking at the summary outline, it is truly dizzying. Leaving aside the fact that the Party committee and administrative summary work should be different, the boundless extent of the outline itself is indeed quite remarkable. In the office of a factory Party committee, there was such a dialogue: "How can we summarize it well?" "Answer it item by item!" "Is that considered a summary?" "What other way is there?" The words expressed a helpless mood. It would not be wrong to understand the last sentence this way: "If we don't respond perfunctorily and hastily, what other way is there?" Such a summary, of course, "will not be able to continue to overcome the chaotic phenomena in the enterprise, and will not be able to move forward faster."

    包罗万象的总结提纲
    石严
    去年十二月二十五日，武汉市机械工业党委办公室向各机械厂发出了一个通知，要各厂总结一年的工作，并且指出：“那一个工厂马虎应付，草率从事，那一个工厂就不能继续克服企业中的混乱现象，就不能更快的前进。”这话说得很对，可是怎么总结呢？随着通知附了一份总结提纲。
    这个提纲共有五大部分，每一部分又分成几节，每节又分成若干问题，其中有些问题又各有五、六个不等的小问题。全份提纲计有十五节；一七二个大小问题，加上技术、经济指标等统计数字，全部细目就在两百条以上。
    内容包括生产情况、增产节约、作业计划、生产调度、一长负责制、科室工作、改变领导作风、劳动竞赛、生产业务知识学习、提拔工人干部、劳动工资、技术管理等等。统计涉及的指标，则有产品产量、生产总值、商品总值、劳动生产率、主要产品均衡率、上缴利润、主要产品质量、工伤事故、产品成本九种之多。而且要求总结出“在全年中每一个季度、每一个月的各种技术、经济指标是多少？实际完成多少？”还要有“计划与实际的百分表”。
    为了完成和充实这样一个复杂的总结的内容，通知还要求各党委负责同志、厂长亲自动手，组织力量进行总结；总结中不要说空话，要以好坏情况对比；不要泛泛一般地总结，……。而且总结期限规定得非常短促，要求一月七日写出正式总结送报机械工业党委。
    问题两百条，要求一连串，看了总结提纲，真是昏头胀脑。先不说党委与行政总结工作应有区别，就拿提纲本身来说，漫无边际的程度，也确实有点可观。在一个工厂党委办公室里有这样一段对话：“怎么总结好啊？”“一条一条对着答呗！”“那也算总结？”“另外还有什么办法？”言语中表现了无可奈何的情绪。这样理解最后一句话是不会错的：“不马虎应付，草率从事，另外还有什么办法呢？”如此总结，当然“就不能继续克服企业中的混乱现象，就不能更快的前进。”
