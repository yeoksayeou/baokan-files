Under the unified leadership of this committee, various preparatory tasks were actively carried out.

The Beijing municipal 1954 Spring Festival cultural and artistic activities, focusing on six suburban areas including Nan Yuan, Hai Dian, East Suburb, Shi Jing Shan, West Beijing Mining Area, and Feng Tai, will vigorously promote the general line of the state during the transition period, combined with the promotion of the general election, expanding investment in agricultural production, and doing a good job in preparing for spring plowing.

Currently, more than 300 literary and art workers from nine professional literary and art groups and schools in the capital have prepared more than 100 literary and art programs to tour the suburbs of Beijing during the Spring Festival. The Central Experimental Opera Troupe has newly created Ping Opera "A Good Future After the Rain" and Luoziju "The Whole Family is Glorified," and the dance "Running the Donkey," as well as several solo programs with the theme of publicizing the general line, and is preparing to perform in the Nanyuan District.

The China Acrobatic Troupe is preparing to bring acrobatic programs that have been well received in many overseas performances, such as "Flying Justice," "Chinese Yo-yo," "Ground Rings," "Unicycle Top Bowl," "Chair Top," "Mixed Skills," "Jars," "Plates," "Magic," "Martial Arts," "Vehicle Skills," "Flower Sticks," etc., all to the Haidian District for performance. The programs performed by the Central Broadcasting Ballad Music Troupe include Xihe Dagu "Narrating Family Matters on the Grain Transportation Road," Danxian "Urban and Rural Happiness," Henan Zhuizi "Wheat Grain Self-Description," "Sisters-in-law Spring Plowing," Leting Dagu "Worker-Peasant Alliance," cross-talk "Peeling Landlord," and suona ensemble, which will be performed in conjunction with the China Acrobatic Troupe. The Beijing Quyi Troupe will perform the Quju "Zhang Gui Rong" starring Wei Xikui in the Shijingshan District. Xin Fengxia of the China Ping Opera Troupe, who recently returned from a performance tour to North Korea, has also actively participated in this activity. The troupe has prepared programs such as "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," "Douzhir Ji," "Ge Ma," and "Linjiang Inn," and is rushing to rehearse "Moon Bay" to publicize the general line, and will perform in Zhoukoudian and other districts. Most of these literary and art groups will perform on February 5th, with a performance period of half a month. In addition, the Chinese Artists Association has also organized an art exhibition team to tour the suburbs.

In terms of film, the Beijing Municipal Cultural Affairs Office has dispatched six film projection teams to screen films free of charge in 100 rural areas in the six suburban districts of Beijing that are relatively remote or rarely see films during the Spring Festival. The films to be screened are twelve kinds of films related to the general line propaganda supplied by the China Film Distribution Company.

In order to promote the performance activities of various mass literary and art groups, the Capital Spring Festival Literary and Art Propaganda Work Committee has supplied ten kinds of singing materials, which have been distributed to 3,500 copies through various cultural centers and stations and trade union systems in Beijing, and have now been adopted and actively rehearsed by many rural drama troupes.
