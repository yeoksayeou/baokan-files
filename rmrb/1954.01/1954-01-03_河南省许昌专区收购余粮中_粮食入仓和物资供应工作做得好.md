Xuchang Special District, Henan Province, Does a Good Job in Grain Storage and Material Supply During Surplus Grain Purchase

The Xuchang Special District in Henan Province achieved good results by vigorously supplying farmers with various materials while organizing grain storage. The grain purchase work in Xuchang Special District has entered a climax. As of December 22nd last year, more than 30 townships in the entire district had completed grain storage, and more than 90 townships were in the process of or about to begin grain storage. Farmers in the Xuchang Special District are in high spirits when delivering grain to the granaries. For example, in Zengfumiao Township, Changge County, a total of 680 men, women, and children organized a team to deliver grain to the granary on December 17th, delivering more than 165,000 jin of grain in two days. The grain delivery team, led by a three-mule cart decorated with flowers and bells from the Wangshuiwang Agricultural Production Cooperative, was followed by carts, wheelbarrows, livestock, and shoulder poles, stretching five li in a mighty procession. Farmers on both sides of the road shouted slogans such as "Learn from the farmers of Zengfumiao" and "Sell surplus grain to the state to support industrial construction." This further encouraged the grain-selling farmers, who wiped the sweat from their foreheads and smiled, "It's really an honor to sell surplus grain to the state." Farmer Liu Genlai immediately used the money from selling 800 jin of grain to buy sesame cakes, repay his state loan, and deposited the rest in the bank. He said with satisfaction, "The government really considers everything for us farmers. We can go back and produce well!"

While organizing farmers to deliver grain to the granary, Jianglijji Township in Xuchang County also held an exhibition of pictures of production and socialist prospects at the conference, as well as on-site demonstrations of tractors and other equipment. Banks, supply and marketing cooperatives, and state-owned trading departments also formed a unified economic team to implement on-site supply. The bank brought cash, and department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives brought calico, towels, socks, farm tools, and fertilizers. The grain company also purchased grain on the spot and paid immediately. Thirty-three farmer households sold grain on the spot at the meeting, selling a total of more than 16,900 jin of grain, receiving more than 14.9 million yuan; of which 4.85 million yuan was deposited in the bank, 1.02 million yuan was used to repay agricultural loans due, 3.04 million yuan was used to purchase fertilizers and farm tools, 1.96 million yuan was used to purchase living materials, and 330,000 yuan was used to join and replenish the shares of the supply and marketing cooperative. Only more than 3 million yuan was taken home because they planned to buy livestock and other necessities. This vivid fact greatly educated the farmers present. For example, farmer Wei Haizhang initially did not understand the benefits of selling surplus grain to the country and to himself. After attending this meeting, he immediately expressed his intention to sell 700 jin of grain when he returned home. Liu Guilan, a female farmer in the township, whose mutual aid group had collapsed in the past, also expressed that she would definitely sell her surplus grain to the state and restore the mutual aid group after seeing the superiority of tractors and new farm tools.

Yuxian County's Wangqiao, Gaomenlou, Kouzhai and other townships organized grain delivery and material supply exhibitions in the same way. Nearly 20,000 people participated, forming a small-scale material exchange fair, which played a significant role. For example, farmers in Zhangzhai Township near Wangqiao reported selling 68,000 jin of grain on December 13th last year. After visiting the meeting on the 14th, they increased the report to more than 96,000 jin that night. Xu Qianzi, a farmer in Jueshan Township, said: "I couldn't sleep after I reported the surplus grain, but I felt comfortable after seeing the exhibition." Liu Tianyi said: "I must cultivate the land well. Sesame cakes, walking plows, and cloth are all delivered to my door. It's really not a loss to sell grain to the country." All townships that delivered grain to the granaries generally did the same. For some materials that farmers wanted to buy but the supply and marketing cooperative could not supply for the time being, they signed contracts with the farmers for continuous supply. According to statistics from the three townships of Lijji, Zengfumiao, and Sanlitou: while farmers sold 421,000 jin of surplus grain, they purchased 168.8 million yuan worth of means of production and living materials, repaid 13.57 million yuan in loans, and saved 65.2 million yuan in banks, totaling more than 80% of the total amount of farmers' grain sales.

In order to fully promote this practice and meet the needs of farmers for means of production and living materials as much as possible after selling surplus grain, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Xuchang Special Commissioner's Office convened a material supply meeting on grain purchase in mid-December last year. At the meeting, transactions reached more than 140 billion yuan, including waterwheels, farm tools, fertilizers, cloth, department stores, etc., as well as various small farm tools and daily necessities processed locally.

    河南省许昌专区收购余粮中
    粮食入仓和物资供应工作做得好
    河南许昌专区组织粮食入仓时，大力供应农民各种物资收到良好效果。许昌专区购粮工作已进入高潮。截至去年十二月二十二日止，全专区已有三十多个乡的粮食入仓完毕，九十多个乡正在进行和即将开始进行粮食入仓。许昌专区农民送粮入仓时，情绪高昂。如长葛县增福庙乡全乡男女老幼共六百八十多人，于十二月十七日整队送粮入仓，两天送粮十六万五千多斤。送粮大队以王水旺农业生产合作社插花挂铃的三骡子大车为前导，后面大车拉、小车推、牲口驮、扁担挑，浩浩荡荡长达五华里。公路两侧农民高喊：“向增福庙农民学习。”“把余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设”的口号。这更鼓舞了卖粮农民的情绪，他们抹着额角的汗水笑道：“把余粮卖给国家真光荣。”农民刘根来把卖八百斤粮的钱立即买了麻饼，和归还了国家贷款，剩下的全部存入银行。他满意地说：“政府真给咱农民打算的周到，回去尽管好好生产啦！”
    许昌县蒋李集乡在组织农民送粮入仓的同时，在大会上举办了生产、社会主义远景的画片展览，和拖拉机等实地表演。银行、供销社和国营贸易部门还统一组成经济小组，实行就地供应。银行带去了现金，百货商店和供销社带去了花布、毛巾、袜子、农具和肥料。粮食公司也就地收购粮食，当场付款。会上农民当场售粮的三十三户，共卖粮一万六千九百多斤，得款一千四百九十多万元；其中存入银行四百八十五万元，归还到期农贷一百零二万元，购买肥料、农具三百零四万元，购买生活资料一百九十六万元，加入和补交供销社股金三十三万元。只有三百多万元因计划买牲口和其他生活必需品，拿回了家。这种活生生的事实，大大教育了到会农民。如农民魏海章起初还不懂得出售余粮对国家、对自己的好处，参加这次会后，当场表示回去要卖粮七百斤。该乡农民妇女刘桂兰过去组织的互助组垮了，看到拖拉机和新式农具的优越性，也表示回去一定把余粮卖给国家，并把互助组恢复起来。
    禹县王桥、高门楼、寇寨等乡以同样方式组织送粮入仓和物资供应展览大会，参加的人数近两万人，形成一个小型物资交流会，起了很大的作用。如王桥附近张寨乡农民，去年十二月十三日自报卖粮六万八千斤，十四日参观了会议后，当晚就增报到九万六千余斤。崛山乡农民徐钳子说：“我报了余粮后睡不着觉，看了展览会，心里舒坦了。”刘天义说：“我非把地种好不可，麻饼、步犁、布匹都给送上门，有粮食卖给国家真不吃亏。”凡粮食入仓的乡，一般都这样做了。农民要买的某些物资，供销社一时供应不上，便和农民订立合同，陆续供应。据李集、增福庙、三里头等三个乡的统计：农民在出卖余粮四十二万一千斤的同时，购买了生产资料和生活资料计一亿六千八百多万元，归还贷款一千三百五十七万元，储蓄到银行六千五百二十万元，三项共占农民卖粮款总数百分之八十以上。
    为全面推行这种作法，尽可能地满足农民出卖余粮后的生产资料和生活资料的需要，中共许昌地委和许昌专署于去年十二月中旬召开了对粮食收购的物资供应会议，会上成交达一千四百多亿元，其中包括水车、农具、肥料、布匹、百货等，另外还有当地加工小型农具及日用品多种。
