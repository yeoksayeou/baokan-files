Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 30th: The four foreign ministers' conference held its fifth meeting on the 29th, chaired by Dulles.

Dulles said that if the records were correct, the meeting had concluded its discussion of the first item on the agenda, and would return to discuss this item at a possible future date. Dulles suggested moving on to the discussion of the second item on the agenda.

Molotov expressed his opposition. He said that the chairman's suggestion was clearly due to some misunderstanding caused by incorrect records. Molotov said, "I have said several times, at least twice, that the Soviet delegation believes that the first item on the agenda includes three aspects: military, political, and economic. We have so far only exchanged views on the political aspect of this issue in more detail, primarily on the issue of relations between the five major powers. We believe it is necessary to temporarily postpone the discussion of the political aspects of the first item on the agenda for further study in a smaller meeting."

Molotov then said, "As for the economic aspect of this issue, to my understanding, the majority of us have expressed our views on this issue. Currently, the French government is negotiating with the Soviet government on economic issues. A delegation from British business circles is also in Moscow. Many other countries are also taking steps to develop economic relations with us. Therefore, we can, at this meeting, at least in the current stage of the meeting, limit ourselves to exchanging views on the economic issues of the first item on the agenda. Compared with other aspects of economic affairs and international relations, things are ultimately easier to handle."

"On the military aspect of this issue, the situation is different with regard to the issue of expanding armaments and stopping the expansion of armaments, as well as disarmament. This issue occupies a very important position in international relations. At yesterday's meeting, the Soviet delegation put forward a proposal on disarmament. It is somewhat perplexing if the United States is unwilling, and France and Britain are also unwilling, to state their attitude towards this proposal."

Molotov said that some might say that the issue of disarmament is being discussed in the United Nations, and that a special committee has been established to study this issue. However, this disarmament committee, which is merely a name, has not done anything. Because the majority formed in this committee is unwilling to discuss the issue of disarmament. This majority passed a resolution to replace the issue of disarmament with the issue of collecting armaments information from various countries. Therefore, the United Nations Disarmament Committee is in a state of paralysis. Molotov said that this may be because the study of this issue has been limited to too narrow a scope. The Soviet delegation believes that it would be correct to study the issue of convening a world universal disarmament conference with the participation of members and non-members of the United Nations. Of course, this issue can and should preferably be studied and resolved at the conference of the five major powers. However, we have not yet reached an agreement on this issue, so the Soviet delegation believes that it would be best if the four foreign ministers did not put things aside and expressed their opinions on the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation at this meeting. I believe that as long as this proposal is adopted, it will give great satisfaction to the people of our four countries and to the people of other countries far beyond the four countries."

Dulles then spoke. He admitted that what he said about the four foreign ministers having concluded the first item on the agenda was obviously a mistake. However, Dulles attempted to prove that it seemed inappropriate to discuss the Soviet delegation's proposal on convening a world universal disarmament conference. Dulles's "argument" was that discussing measures to ease international tensions would only exacerbate tensions. He said that he did not advocate discussing the issue of convening a world disarmament conference because, it was said, the United Nations had already discussed this issue without any results. However, Dulles did not mention that the reason why the United Nations did not achieve any positive results on the issue of disarmament was precisely because all the proposals put forward by the Soviet representative on this issue were invariably opposed by the US delegation and the delegations of countries that followed the US.

Dulles insisted again that the only two issues that could be satisfactorily resolved at this meeting were the German issue and the Austrian issue. He insisted that discussing the issue of disarmament was a kind of "propaganda."

In his speech, Bidault mentioned that if the major powers did not reach an agreement on the general restriction of armaments and international control, then the existing international disputes would remain unresolved for a long time. He believed that the first stage of this issue should be handled by the United Nations. Bidault put forward another proposal. This proposal said: "An agreement on disarmament would greatly promote the resolution of international disputes, which is necessary for the establishment of lasting peace." This proposal suggested that the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and Britain should make consistent efforts in the United Nations Disarmament Committee "to enable this committee to reach an agreement on the basic principles of disarmament, so that a world universal disarmament conference can be convened under successful conditions, in accordance with the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on January 11, 1952." Bidault suggested that the entire issue be submitted to the foreign ministers' meeting without advisors for study.

Eden said that he supported the view that the discussion of the issue of disarmament should not be fundamentally rejected, but that this issue should be left for later discussion in order to move on to the discussion of the second item on the agenda.

Next, Molotov spoke. He said that if the participants only considered the second and third items on the agenda to be important, and the first item to be unimportant, it would make it difficult to reach an agreement. The Soviet delegation believed that all the issues discussed at this meeting were important. It should not be considered that the issue of disarmament was raised for propaganda purposes. The issue of disarmament was raised not for propaganda, but in order to find a way to resolve it. The Soviet delegation believed that the most important of all the international issues that the people of our countries, and not just the people of our countries, are deeply concerned about is the issue of disarmament, is the issue of reducing the burden of armaments, because solving this issue would truly take a step towards easing international tensions. Molotov pointed out that one should not portray things as if it was others who committed the crime of aggression; it is wrong to push the guilt you have committed onto others. Whoever is guilty bears the responsibility.

Regarding Bidault's proposal, Molotov said that he needed to study the proposal before he could express his opinion. He finally said that he supported Bidault and Eden's suggestion to submit the Soviet and French proposals to the foreign ministers' meeting without advisors for discussion. Dulles also expressed his agreement with this suggestion. In this way, this suggestion was adopted by the meeting.

Next, Dulles, as chairman, suggested starting to discuss the second item on the agenda: "The German issue and the task of guaranteeing European security." Molotov requested to speak on the issue of the procedure for discussion. He said that before starting the discussion of the second item on the agenda – "The German issue and the task of guaranteeing European security" – the Soviet delegation believed that it was necessary to first study an issue. Molotov referred to the letter written by the government of the German Democratic Republic to this foreign ministers' meeting. In the letter, the government of the German Democratic Republic proposed that when the Berlin four foreign ministers' conference discusses the German issue, representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany must participate. Molotov said that the Soviet delegation believed that it was necessary to pay special attention to this request from the German Democratic Republic.

Molotov then said that West Germany had not made this request, but the Soviet delegation did not believe that West German representatives did not want to come to this meeting to express their opinions.

The Soviet government has always believed that it is impossible to successfully resolve the German issue on a peaceful and democratic basis without the participation of German representatives. The German issue is first and foremost a matter for the Germans themselves. The participation of German representatives in this meeting would greatly contribute to the discussion of the German issue. This can be illustrated by the following situation: the position of the government of the German Democratic Republic, which requested the participation of representatives from East Germany and West Germany in this meeting, was supported by more than nine million German citizens, who all signed in favor of such a proposal. Therefore, the Soviet delegation suggested inviting representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in the discussion of the second item on the agenda.

Dulles said that the US delegation could not agree to the suggestion of inviting representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to participate in the discussion of the German issue. Dulles said that he strongly doubted whether there currently exists a German government or a German joint regime that can represent the entire German people.

Bidault and Eden also opposed inviting representatives from the two parts of Germany to participate in the meeting when discussing the German issue.

Molotov firmly opposed the position of the three Western foreign ministers. He said that we must take into account the fact that there is currently no unified Germany. Therefore, we must draw the conclusion that we should listen to the opinions of representatives from East Germany and representatives from West Germany here. The fact that the West German political system is different from the East German political system cannot be used as a reason to draw other conclusions. On the contrary, since the situation in East Germany is very different, it is especially necessary to listen to the opinions of representatives from the two parts of Germany.

Molotov pointed out that a resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 4, 1951, stated that the Special Political Committee decided to invite official representatives from West Germany, East Germany, and the eastern and western districts of Berlin to speak on the German issue in the committee. Molotov said that if we want to move forward, and in no way move backward, then we must make a decision that is as correct as the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.

Molotov pointed out that the Soviet Union has only established formal relations with the German Democratic Republic, while France, Britain, and the United States have only established formal relations with West Germany. But this issue should not be reduced to just a matter of formal relations. Refusing to invite representatives from East Germany and West Germany would be interpreted incorrectly. This can only be understood as: either it is considered unnecessary to unite the two parts of Germany, or the participants of this meeting do not believe in such unity, and even rule out the possibility of trying to narrow the differences between East Germany and West Germany and bring the two sides closer. This will not help eliminate the obstacles on the road to restoring German national unity, but will instead widen such obstacles.

Molotov then said that the fact that there are no formal relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany does not in any way prevent the possibility of appropriate contacts and the establishment of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. Attempts to establish such relations have long been made, but it must be admitted that these attempts are still insufficient and have not yielded the desired results. However, this does not mean that we should not now try to establish business contacts so that, for example, economic relations can be properly developed, because West Germany's interest in this is no less than that of the Soviet Union.

Friendly relations have been established between East Germany and the Soviet Union in political, economic, and cultural aspects. However, cultural delegations have not yet been exchanged between the Soviet Union and West Germany. Molotov said that the Soviet scientific and artistic circles by no means consider the current situation of no normal contact between relevant people in our country and West Germany to be ideal. If cultural relations between the Soviet Union and France or between the Soviet Union and Poland are constantly developing, then why can't such relations be established not only between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, but also between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany?

Molotov also pointed out that when discussing the German issue at this Berlin conference, if we do not listen to the opinions of representatives from East Germany and West Germany, it is tantamount to putting the cart before the horse from the very beginning. Someone here said that we must wait until the so-called all-German legitimate government is established before we can do this. Therefore, what should be studied now is not the issue raised by the Soviet delegation regarding inviting German representatives to participate in the meeting and express their opinions on the German issue, but the issue of electoral law and procedures. But we should pay attention to the situation of the German people themselves. They care about people listening to their opinions. Molotov then said that today someone suggested discussing the German issue in Berlin without the need for German participation, saying that this is the best way to discuss the German issue because there will be less controversy. Tomorrow, someone will suggest holding so-called free elections in Germany with the participation of the occupying authorities. On the one hand, the Germans are turned into objects of the occupying authorities, and on the other hand, such elections are called free elections. However, these are not elections that the Germans themselves want to conduct. Molotov said that if we do not listen to the opinions of the Germans (even if these opinions are different), we cannot and should not discuss the German issue.

Molotov finally reiterated the Soviet delegation's proposal: invite representatives from the two parts of Germany to participate in this meeting in order to listen to the opinions of the government of the German Democratic Republic and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany before the participants of the meeting express their own opinions.

After Molotov spoke, Bidault and Eden spoke again. They avoided giving a direct and clear answer to the Soviet proposal regarding inviting representatives from the two parts of Germany to participate in the discussion of the German issue. Eden presented a five-stage "British plan for restoring German unity" to the meeting. Eden said that "free elections" are the main factor in his proposed plan. At the same time, it can be understood from Eden's proposal that German elections should be conducted under the supervision of the countries occupying Germany.

After Eden spoke, Molotov pointed out that both Eden and Bidault avoided giving a clear answer to the Soviet proposal regarding inviting representatives of the German people to participate in this meeting to discuss the German issue. Since it was late, the Soviet proposal could be moved to the next meeting for discussion, but in any case, a clear answer must be given to this issue. Dulles, as chairman, said that due to the lateness of the hour, the issue raised by the Soviet delegation would be moved to the next meeting for study.

### 苏、法、英、美四国外长会议开始讨论第二项议程  莫洛托夫坚决主张邀请东西德代表参加讨论  裁减军备问题的提案将交没有顾问参加的外长会议讨论

　　苏、法、英、美四国外长会议开始讨论第二项议程
　　莫洛托夫坚决主张邀请东西德代表参加讨论
　　裁减军备问题的提案将交没有顾问参加的外长会议讨论
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社柏林三十日讯：四国外长会议于二十九日举行第五次会议，由杜勒斯担任主席。
    杜勒斯说，如果记录上的记载是正确的话，会议就结束了关于第一项议程的讨论，在将来有可能的时候，再回转来讨论这个项目，杜勒斯建议转入第二项议程的讨论。
    莫洛托夫表示反对。他说，主席的建议显然是由于记录不正确而引起的某种误解。莫洛托夫说，我曾说过几次，至少说过两次，苏联代表团认为，第一项议程包括三个方面：军事、政治和经济。我们迄今只是就这个问题的政治方面，首先是就五大国间的关系问题比较详细地交换了意见。我们认为有必要暂时延缓关于第一项议程的政治方面的讨论，以便在范围较小的会议上进一步加以研究。
    莫洛托夫接着说，至于这个问题的经济方面，据我的了解，我们中间的多数人已表示了我们对这个问题的看法。目前，法国政府正在就经济问题与苏联政府谈判。英国企业界也有一个代表团在莫斯科。许多其他国家也在采取步骤来发展与我们的经济关系。因此，我们可以在这个会议上，至少在会议的目前阶段，只限于就第一项议程的经济问题交换意见。拿经济方面和国际关系的其他方面相比，事情终归是比较好办的。
    在这个问题的军事方面，在扩充军备和制止扩充军备以及裁减军备的问题上，情况就不同了。这个问题在国际关系中占很重要的地位。在昨天的会议上，苏联代表团提出了一项关于裁减军备的建议。如果美国不愿、法英两国也不愿表明它们对这个建议的态度，那就有些令人费解了。
    莫洛托夫说，有人可以说，裁减军备问题正在联合国中讨论，并且还设立了一个专门委员会来研究这个问题。但是，这个徒负虚名的裁减军备委员会没有做什么事情。因为，在这个委员会中形成的多数不愿讨论裁减军备问题。这个多数通过了一项决议，用搜集各个国家军备情报问题代替裁减军备问题。因此，联合国裁减军备委员会处于瘫痪的状态。莫洛托夫说，这或许是因为把对这个问题的研究限制在太狭窄的范围内所致。苏联代表团认为，研究召开有联合国会员国与非会员国参加的世界普遍裁减军备会议的问题将是正确的。当然，这个问题可以而且最好是在五大国会议上进行研究和解决。但是，我们还没有在这个问题上达成协议，因此苏联代表团认为最好四国外长不要把事情搁置起来，就在这次会议上对苏联代表团所提出的建议发表意见。我认为，只要采纳了这一建议就够了，就会使我们四国的人民和远远超过四国以外的其他国家的人民，感到很大的满意。
    杜勒斯接着发言。他承认：他所说的四国外长已经结束了第一项议程，显然是个错误。然而杜勒斯企图证明，似乎不应当讨论苏联代表团所提出的关于召开世界普遍裁减军备会议的建议。杜勒斯的“论点”是：讨论关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施问题只会加剧紧张局势。他说，他不主张讨论关于召开世界裁减军备会议的问题，因为，据说是联合国已经讨论过这个问题而毫无结果。可是杜勒斯一句也没有提到：联合国之所以没有在裁减军备问题上获得任何积极的结果，正是因为苏联代表在这个问题上所提出的一切建议都毫无例外地遭到了美国代表团和追随美国的国家的代表团的反对。
    杜勒斯又坚持说，在这次会议上可能获得圆满结果的问题只有两个，即德国问题和奥地利问题。他硬说讨论裁减军备的问题是一种“宣传”。
    皮杜尔在发言中提到：如果各大国在关于军备的普遍限制和国际管制的问题上没有达成协议，那么现存的国际争端就会长期得不到解决。他认为，这个问题的第一阶段应当由联合国来处理。皮杜尔提出了另一个提案。这个提案说：“就裁减军备问题达成协议，会大大促进国际争端的解决，而这种解决乃是建立持久和平所必须的。”这个提案建议美、法、苏、英四国在联合国裁减军备委员会中一致努力，“使这个委员会就裁减军备的基本原则达成协议，以便在可以成功的条件下，根据一九五二年一月十一日联合国大会通过的决议，召开世界普遍裁减军备会议”。皮杜尔建议把整个这个问题交给没有顾问参加的外长会议研究。
    艾登说，他支持这种意见，即不应根本拒绝讨论裁减军备问题，只是把这个问题留到以后讨论，以便转入第二项议程的讨论。
    接着，莫洛托夫发言。他说，如果与会者只认为议程的第二项和第三项重要，而第一项不重要，那就会使得达成协议困难起来。苏联代表团认为这次会议讨论的一切问题都是重要的。不应该认为，提出裁减军备问题是为了宣传。裁减军备问题的提出，不是为了宣传，而是为了求得解决它的途径。苏联代表团认为，我们这几个国家的人民，而且不仅仅是我们这几个国家的人民，所深切关心的一切国际问题中最重要的问题莫过于裁减军备问题，莫过于减轻军备负担问题，因为解决这个问题，便可以真正向缓和国际紧张局势方面迈进一步。莫洛托夫指出，不应把事情说成是好像犯了侵略罪行的是别人；把自己所犯的罪过推到别人身上是不对的。谁有罪谁担当。
    莫洛托夫就皮杜尔的提案说，要先把这个提案研究一下，才能发表意见。他最后说，他支持皮杜尔和艾登的建议，即把苏联和法国的提案交给没有顾问参加的外长会议讨论。杜勒斯也表示同意这个建议。这样，这个建议就被会议通过了。
    接着，担任主席的杜勒斯建议着手讨论第二项议程：“德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务”。莫洛托夫要求就讨论的程序问题发言。他说，在开始讨论第二项议程——“德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务”——以前，苏联代表团认为有必要先研究一个问题。莫洛托夫提到德意志民主共和国政府写给这次外长会议的信件。德意志民主共和国政府在信中提出：当柏林四国外长会议讨论德国问题时，必须有德意志民主共和国和西德的代表参加。莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团认为，必须特别重视德意志民主共和国的这一要求。
    莫洛托夫接着说，西德没有提出这一要求，但是苏联代表团并不认为，西德代表不希望到这次会议上来提出自己的意见。
    苏联政府一直认为，如果没有德国代表参加，要想顺利地在和平与民主的基础上解决德国问题是不可能的。德国问题首先是德国人自己的事情。有德国代表参加这次会议，在相当大的程度上有助于德国问题的讨论。这一点可以从下列情况得到说明：德意志民主共和国政府要求东德和西德的代表参加这次会议的立场，得到了九百多万德国公民的支持，他们都签名赞成这样一个建议。因此，苏联代表团建议邀请德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的代表参加第二项议程的讨论。
    杜勒斯说，美国代表团不能同意邀请德意志民主共和国和西德的代表参加讨论德国问题的建议。杜勒斯说，他十分怀疑究竟目前是否存在能够代表全体德国人民的德国政府或德国联合政权。
    皮杜尔和艾登也反对邀请德国两部分的代表在讨论德国问题时参加会议。
    莫洛托夫坚决反对西方三国外长的立场。他说，我们必须要考虑到这个事实：目前还没有一个统一的德国。因而必须得出这样的结论：我们在这里应当听取东德代表和西德代表的意见。西德政治制度不同于东德的政治制度的事实，并不能作为得出其他结论的理由。恰恰相反，由于东德的情况大大不同，特别需要听取德国两部分代表的意见。
    莫洛托夫指出，一九五一年十二月四日联合国大会通过的一项决议说：特别政治委员会决定邀请西德、东德以及柏林东西区的正式代表在委员会上就德国问题发言。莫洛托夫说，如果我们要前进，而无论如何不往后退，那我们就必须作出和联合国大会决议同样正确的决定。
    莫洛托夫指出，苏联只与德意志民主共和国建立了正式关系，而法国、英国和美国只与西德建立了正式关系。但是不应当把这个问题降低到仅仅一个正式关系问题。拒绝邀请东德和西德的代表会得到不正确的解释。这只能了解为：或者是认为没有必要把德国两个部分统一起来，或者是这次会议的参加者不相信这种统一，甚至排除设法缩小东德和西德之间的分歧和使双方接近的可能性。这不会有助于消除恢复德国全国统一道路上的障碍，反而会扩大这种障碍。
    莫洛托夫接着说，苏联和西德没有正式关系这种情况，决不妨碍苏联和西德联邦共和国之间有可能发生适当的接触和建立关系。这种建立关系的尝试早就有了，但是应当承认，这些尝试还是不够的，还没有得到应有的结果。然而这决不意味着现在就不应当尝试建立事务上的接触，以使例如经济上的关系得到适当的发展，因为西德在这方面的兴趣并不比苏联来得少。
    东德和苏联之间，无论在政治和经济方面，或是在文化方面，都建立了友好关系。但是在苏联和西德之间，还没有交换过文化代表团。莫洛托夫说，苏联的科学和艺术界决不认为目前我国和西德有关人士之间没有正常联系的这种情况是理想的。如果苏联和法国之间或是苏联和波兰之间的文化关系正在不断发展，那么，为什么不能够不仅在苏联和德意志民主共和国之间，而且也在苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间建立起这种关系呢？
    莫洛托夫还指出，在这次柏林会议上讨论德国问题时，如果不听取东德和西德代表的意见，等于从一开始就把问题本末倒置了。这里有人说，必须要等到所谓全德合法政府成立后才能这样作，因而，现在应当研究的并不是苏联代表团所提出的关于邀请德国代表参加会议、就德国问题表示自己意见的问题，而是关于选举法和程序问题。但是，我们应当注意德国人民本身的情况。他们关心人们听取他们的意见。莫洛托夫接着说，今天有人建议在柏林讨论德国问题而不必要德国人参加，说这是讨论德国问题的最好的方式，因为这样就会少发生争论。到明天，又将有人建议在占领当局参加下，在德国举行所谓自由选举。一方面把德国人变成占领当局的对象，另一方面又把这种选举叫做自由选举。然而这不是德国人自己要进行的选举。莫洛托夫说，如果我们不听取德国人的意见（即使这些意见各不相同），我们就不可能也不应该讨论德国问题。
    莫洛托夫最后再一次提出苏联代表团的建议：邀请德国两部分的代表参加这次会议，以便在会议参加者发表自己的意见以前，听取德意志民主共和国政府和西德联邦共和国政府的意见。
    莫洛托夫发言之后，皮杜尔和艾登又一次发言。他们避免对苏联关于邀请德国两部分的代表参加德国问题的讨论的建议作直接和明确的答复。艾登向会议提出了一个分五个阶段的“恢复德国统一的英国计划”。艾登说，“自由选举”是他所提出的计划中的主要因素。同时，从艾登的建议中可以了解，德国选举应当在占领德国的各国的监督下进行。
    艾登发言后，莫洛托夫发言指出，艾登和皮杜尔都避免对苏联关于邀请德国人民代表参加这次会议讨论德国问题的建议作明确的答复。由于时间已晚，苏联的建议可以移到下一次会议再讨论，然而无论如何必须对这个问题给予明确的答复。担任主席的杜勒斯说，由于时间已晚，对苏联代表团提出的问题移到下一次会议来研究。
