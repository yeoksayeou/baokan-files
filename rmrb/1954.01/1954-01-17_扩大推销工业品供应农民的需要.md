Expanding the Supply of Industrial Products to Meet Farmers' Needs
    Qin Lifang

    Currently, the work of purchasing grain, cotton, and oil crops is in full swing throughout the country. State-owned commercial enterprises are actively expanding the promotion of industrial products to meet the needs of farmers, which is an important aspect of supporting grain and cotton purchasing.

    At present, how can we do a good job in expanding the promotion of industrial products? First of all, we should understand the needs of farmers and, based on these needs, correctly organize the supply of goods and vigorously promote sales. We know that farmers, after selling grain and cash crops, generally want to save some money for use as agricultural capital in the spring planting season. The remaining money may first be considered for purchasing production materials such as carts, draft animals, farm tools, and fertilizers, and they will naturally also buy some needed industrial products and add some household items such as pots, pans, and bowls. Therefore, we must both help rural supply and marketing cooperatives vigorously find ways to organize the supply of production materials and household sundries needed by farmers, such as supplying cooperatives with raw iron, scrap steel, and scrap iron to make farm tools, iron pots, etc. that meet the needs of farmers, and also supply farmers with needed industrial products through various means. Based on the needs of farmers, we must correctly organize the supply of goods and guide production. Currently, many state-owned commercial institutions in various regions are familiarizing themselves with customer requirements by understanding the needs of members through cooperatives, or by holding forums and commodity exhibitions, inviting customers to visit commodities and express their opinions verbally. This is a very good method. Many facts tell us that farmers do not necessarily need high-end goods with a wide sales network in cities. They prefer cheap and good quality goods, but not necessarily brand-name goods. Therefore, we should not only see the needs of the moment and compete for brand-name goods. At the same time, for commodities that we subjectively consider not to be bestsellers, farmers will be happy to buy them after the salesperson's promotion and explanation or timely modification. As for commodities that cannot be fully supplied for the time being due to raw materials and production limitations, the source of goods should be estimated realistically, and pre-ordering methods can be adopted to carry out planned procurement and supply. Only when we can further investigate the needs of farmers in the work of expanding the promotion of industrial products and actively guide consumption can we better serve production and the ever-growing needs of the people.

    Second, we must strengthen material allocation. In order to meet the needs of farmers, it is necessary to do a good job in material allocation and regulation in a timely manner. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the inventory of grassroots units has been much more abundant than before, creating favorable conditions for supplying the countryside. However, at present, some commodities still have larger inventories in the central wholesale stations of several state-owned companies than in the inventories of grassroots stores nationwide, or they are stored in secondary wholesale stations and have not yet been dispatched to the countryside in large quantities. The distribution of some commodities between regions is very uneven, and the phenomenon of surpluses in area A and stock-outs in area B still exists. Therefore, all goods suitable for rural sales must be transferred from cities to rural areas as much as possible; of course, it is not advisable to carry out blind allocation for goods that are not suitable for rural needs. At the same time, when allocating materials to the countryside, the impact on the supply of cities and industrial and mining areas should not be too great. The materials stored in the central wholesale stations should be quickly allocated to lower-level units according to necessity and possibility. The secondary wholesale stations should play the role of reservoirs, but during the peak sales season, they should take the initiative to release their inventory downwards. The secondary wholesale stations have the support of the central stations, and the goods can arrive continuously, so the existing inventory can be released boldly. For example, under the leadership of the administrative departments, Hebei Province, in the spirit of cities supporting the countryside, transferred 41 billion yuan of commodities from state-owned department stores in five cities, including Shijiazhuang, to replenish rural department stores. It is also necessary to carry out adjustments between large administrative regions or between provinces within the same large administrative region. Adjustments between large regions should be the responsibility of the general companies of state-owned specialized companies. Provinces within the region are responsible for the business organization of the district-level companies or the Large District Commercial Administration Bureau. Of course, the adjustment work should be carried out by strengthening contacts, exchanging information between the upper and lower levels, and within the established plans of each province without affecting the import of other provinces. Individual state-owned stores in large cities not only fail to complete their sales plans, but are also reluctant to transfer their inventory to other places; there are also state-owned companies in producing areas that collect local sugar and propose to first meet the needs of their own regions, and are unwilling to quickly and timely allocate it to various parts of the country according to the plan. Similar practices are not in line with current requirements. In the allocation work, it is necessary to make full use of various transportation forces, borrow vehicles from other departments when necessary, or make necessary adjustments to the transportation tonnage within the system, that is, between state-owned companies, according to the urgency and importance of the situation. This is what must be paid attention to in strengthening material allocation.

    Third, it is necessary to closely integrate with cooperatives. In recent times, there has been further integration between state-owned commerce and cooperatives. State-owned commerce has given priority to the supply of goods to cooperatives in the allocation of goods, and has implemented the preferential rates stipulated for cooperatives. For example, the mobile groups organized by state-owned commercial organizations in the Hebei area to bring goods to the countryside are mainly to facilitate the purchase of goods by grassroots cooperatives. Due to the close integration of the two sides, large quantities of materials have arrived at the grassroots units of cooperatives, which has greatly helped expand rural supply and cooperate with grain purchases. During the grain purchase period, short-term sales on credit were generally implemented for cooperatives with financial difficulties, which enabled the grassroots cooperatives in various places to increase the variety of operations and expand the amount of money sold, which played a great role in quickly getting goods to the countryside to supply the needs of farmers, but there are also many problems. It is currently estimated that the total sales on credit by the state-owned commercial system to cooperatives have reached more than 3 trillion yuan. In the first ten days of December last year, 74 percent of the cloth sold by eight units of the Henan Provincial Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company was sold on credit to cooperatives and department stores. The Sixth District Cooperative of Xuchang County had more than 300 million yuan in funds and once sold more than 600 million yuan in cloth on credit. The credit period is generally one month to forty days, and some still only deliver the payment after selling the goods, forming the situation that some state-owned stores have difficulties in capital turnover. For example, the working capital of the Luohe State-owned Department Store is 6 billion yuan, and the amount sold on credit to cooperatives accounts for 3.5 billion yuan. In response to the above situation, the Henan Provincial Department of Commerce has stipulated methods to correct it in a timely manner. For example, the Lanxi County Department Store completed more than 99 percent of its sales plan for the entire quarter at the end of November last year, while the amount owed by cooperatives accounted for 88 percent of the total sales. Cooperatives in the Bijie area of ​​Guizhou purchase goods from state-owned companies without a time limit for payment. Cooperatives sell on credit layer by layer internally, and even some grassroots cooperatives in some provinces also sell on credit to farmers, causing cooperatives to not pay attention to strengthening business management, resulting in capital backlog. In response to the above situation, the Central Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have recently jointly issued instructions, which said: "In order to cooperate with the needs of grain purchases, the regulations on short-term sales on credit to cooperatives during the grain purchase period will continue to be implemented. After the basic completion of grain purchases, it should be gradually reduced according to regional conditions, and sales on credit should generally be stopped before March and settled quickly." In order to avoid making the material strength too dispersed, facilitate mobile scheduling, ensure the stability of the entire market, and urge each enterprise to improve business management, strengthen economic accounting, and accelerate commodity circulation, this joint instruction must be implemented.

    Fourth, it is necessary to correctly utilize private merchants. In order to do a good job in supplying industrial products in rural areas, it is also necessary to correctly utilize small wholesalers between urban and rural areas and retailers in cities, towns, and fairs. For example, the Daily Sundries Wholesale Department of the Tianjin State-owned Department Store convened various symposiums with private merchants in order to correctly give play to the positive role of private retailers, and signed supply agreements with them. The wholesale department has now signed regular supply agreements with more than half of the private department store retailers in Tianjin. However, many units still lack a correct understanding of the correct utilization of private merchants. We believe that for all kinds of commodities with assured sources, except for a few important means of production that must be sold according to plan, they should generally be appropriately sold to private retailers and small wholesalers in urban and rural areas. And supervise them to sell at the prices stipulated by state-owned companies to serve consumers. We must resolutely oppose the illegal acts of private merchants who engage in speculation, hoarding, stir up trouble in the market, and seek exorbitant profits.

    扩大推销工业品供应农民的需要
    秦柳方
    现在全国各地收购粮食、棉花及油料作物工作正在紧张阶段。国营商业积极扩大推销工业品，供应农民的需要，是支持粮棉收购工作的一个重要方面。
    在目前，怎样才能做好扩大工业品的推销工作呢？首先我们应该了解农民的需要，并根据农民的需要，正确地组织货源，大力推销。我们知道，农民售出了粮食和经济作物，一般地愿意存一点钱，留待春耕季节用作农本。余下来的钱，也可能首先考虑添置大车、耕畜、农具、肥料等生产资料，自然也会买一点合乎需要的工业品以及添补一些锅盆碗盏等家用杂物。所以我们既要帮助农村供销合作社大力设法组织农民所需生产资料和家用杂物的供应，如以生铁、废钢、废铁等供应合作社，制成合乎农民需要的农具、铁锅等，也要通过各种方式供应农民需要的工业品，并根据农民的需要，正确组织货源，指导生产。目前不少地区的国营商业机构通过合作社，了解社员需要，或者召开座谈会举行商品展览会，请顾客参观商品，口头发表意见，熟悉顾客的要求，是很好的办法。很多事实告诉我们：农民不一定需要城市有广大销路的高档货，他们喜欢价廉物美，但不一定是名牌货的商品，所以，我们不应该只看到一时一地的需要，争着要名牌货。同时，在我们主观上认为非热销的商品，经过售货员的宣传解释或及时改制，农民是会乐于选购的。至于一时限于原料和生产，不能获得充分供应的商品，则应实事求是地估计货源，可采用预订方式，进行有计划的采购和供应。只有我们在扩大推销工业品工作中，能进一步调查农民的需要，并积极指导消费，才能更好地为生产和日益增长的人民的需要服务。
    第二、要加强物资调拨。为了满足农民需要，必须及时做好物资调拨与调剂工作。去年第四季度以来，基层单位的存量虽较以前大为充裕，对农村供应工作创造了有利条件。但目前有些商品依然是几个国营公司中央批发站的存量大于全国基层商店的库存、或存储在二级批发站，还没有大量下乡，有些商品地区之间分布得很不平衡，甲地多余，乙地脱销的现象也还存在。因此，凡适合农村销售的，必须尽可能由城市调拨到农村去；当然不适合农村需要的，不宜进行盲目调拨。同时，向农村调拨物资时，对城市与工矿区的供应工作，也不要影响过大。中央批发站储存的物资，要按照必要与可能，迅速地调拨到下层单位去。二级批发站本要起蓄水池的作用，但在销售旺季，要主动将存货下放，二级批发站既有中央站的支持，进货亦能源源到达，现有存货尽可放手下拨。如河北省在行政部门主持下，本着城市支持乡村的精神，曾就石家庄等五个市的国营百货机构调剂出四一○亿元的商品，充实农村百货商店。大行政区之间，或在同一大行政区内的各省之间进行调剂，也是必要的。大区之间的调剂，要由国营专业公司的总公司负责。区内各省由区级公司或大区商业管理局的业务组织负责。当然调剂工作的进行，要加强联系，上下互通情况，并且要在各省既定计划范围之内而不影响其他省区的调入。个别大城市国营商店，自己既完不成推销计划，又舍不得将存货向外地进行调剂；也有产地的国营公司收了土糖，提出要首先满足本区的需要，不愿迅速而及时地按计划向全国各地进行调拨，类此做法，均是不合乎当前要求的。在调拨工作中，要充分运用各种运输力量，必要时向其他部门借用车辆，或在本系统内即国营公司相互之间分别缓急轻重，将运输吨位作必要的调剂，也是加强物资调拨所必须注意的。
    第三、要密切结合合作社。最近一个时期，国营商业与合作社之间有了进一步的结合。国营商业已做到了在货源分配上优先供应合作社，并贯彻了对合作社规定的优待率。如河北地区国营商业组织流动小组带货下乡，主要是为了便利基层合作社的进货。由于双方的密切结合，大批物资到了合作社基层单位，这对扩大农村供应工作，配合购粮，有很大帮助。在购粮期间，对资金困难的合作社，一般都执行了短期赊销的规定，使各地基层合作社经营品种增多，卖钱额扩大，对迅速把商品拿到乡村供应农民需要起了很大作用，但也存在不少问题。目前估计国营商业全系统对合作社赊销已达三万亿元以上，河南省花纱布公司八个单位去年十二月上旬销布，百分之七十四是赊销给合作社和百货公司的，许昌县六区合作社有资金三亿多元，一次赊布六亿多。赊销时间一般一个月到四十天，还有的卖货交款，不卖不给，形成有些国营商店资金周转困难，如漯河国营百货商店核定资金六十亿，赊给合作社的即占三十五亿。以上情况，河南商业厅已规定办法及时予以纠正。又如兰溪县百货公司去年十一月末完成全季销售计划百分之九十九以上，而合作社欠款即占全部销售量百分之八十八。贵州毕节地区合作社向国营公司取货，付款不限期。合作社内部层层赊销，甚至有些省的基层社对农民也赊销，使合作社不注意加强经营管理，造成资金积压。针对以上情况，最近中央商业部与全国合作总社已联合发出指示，指示中说：“为配合购粮需要，在购粮期间，对合作社短期赊销的规定仍继续执行，购粮基本结束之后，应根据地区情况逐步缩小，一般在三月份以前要停止赊销，并迅速结算清楚。”为了避免使物资力量摆得过于分散，便于机动调度，保证整个市场的稳定，以及督促每个企业改善经营管理，加强经济核算，加速商品流转，必须贯彻执行这个联合指示。
    第四、要正确利用私商。为做好农村中的工业品供应工作，还必须正确地利用城乡之间的小批发商与城市和乡镇、集市的零售商。如天津市国营百货公司日用百货批发部为了正确发挥私营零售商的积极作用，召集私商举行各种座谈会，并和其签订供应协议。该批发部现已和天津市一半以上的私营百货零售商签订了定期供应协议。但是也有不少单位，对正确利用私商还缺乏正确的了解。我们认为凡货源有把握的各种商品，除某几种重要的生产资料须按计划掌握销售外，一般应对私营零售商及城乡小批发商适当出售。并监督其按国营公司规定的牌价出售，为消费者服务。私商的投机取巧，囤积居奇，在市场上兴风作浪，牟取暴利的不法行为，我们必须坚决予以反对。
