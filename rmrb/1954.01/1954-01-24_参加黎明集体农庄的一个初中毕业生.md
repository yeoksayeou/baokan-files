    A Junior High School Graduate Joins the Dawn Collective Farm
    Gen Quan, Yu Xing
    A few months ago, a junior high school graduate came to the Dawn Collective Farm in Jilin Province. Her name is Liang Yunu, nineteen years old, and she is a girl from a worker's family at the Shixian Paper Mill in Wangqing County. She requested to come to the farm herself after graduating from junior high school. After arriving at the farm, she worked with the farm members in threshing, building cowsheds, helping the accountant organize accounts, teaching night school, and doing other work.

      Beautiful Ideals
    When Liang Yunu was in middle school, she learned about the happy life of Soviet farmers from textbooks. After watching the movie "Gold Star Hero," the scenes of Soviet farmers happily driving tractors to cultivate land and threshing machines to thresh grain would appear in her mind as soon as she closed her eyes. She constantly heard her teacher's words: "The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow." Thinking about the future of the motherland's countryside, she associated it with her future career, and she thought: "What will I do in the future?" She came to the conclusion: "I will go to the countryside and build a countryside like the Soviet Union!"

    Last spring, all the students went to Longsheng Village to visit the agricultural producers' cooperative. As soon as they entered the village of Longsheng, the large tracts of land belonging to the producers' cooperative came into view. On the boundless land, the members were plowing the land with wooden plows. She stared at this land in a daze, and she said to herself: "What a good piece of land, how happy it would be to drive a tractor on such fertile land!" From this, she loved the countryside even more and yearned for the future of the motherland's countryside even more.

    The Wish to Participate in Agricultural Production is Fulfilled
    Last July, Liang Yunu's class was about to graduate. The students were all talking about their future: some wanted to go to senior high school; some said they wanted to go to geological school; some wanted to go to industrial vocational school, and so on.

    One day, the teacher distributed "Hope Forms" to the students. Liang Yunu took it and, as if she had already considered it, quickly wrote down these two things: "My hope is: first, to go to agricultural technical school; second, to go to the countryside." Later, she decided to go to the countryside.

    One day, her brother Liang Xiying came. Liang Yunu told her brother about her ideal, and finally she asked: "Tell me, what procedures are needed to go to the countryside?"

    "You've thought very well. I think it's better to ask the government to consider the assignment." Liang Xiying continued: "But rural work is very hard, and there are many difficulties, so you must have a very strong will." As he spoke, he took out a book "The Road to Communism" and gave it to her, saying: "Read it carefully, it will definitely be of great help to you!"

    Liang Yunu accepted her brother's opinion and wrote a letter to Chairman Zhu of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region People's Government. After ten days, the Autonomous Region Government notified her: the Autonomous Region People's Government had approved her to go to the Dawn Collective Farm. After receiving the notice, she jumped up with joy and said: "My hope has finally been realized!"

   "Don't Bow Your Head in the Face of Difficulties"
    On the evening of October 27 last year, she came to the farm. The farm members welcomed her warmly and shook hands with her. An old woman surnamed Zhang asked her touchingly: "Why did you come here?"

    "In order to build a beautiful countryside like the Soviet Union with you." Liang Yunu replied with a smile.

    "Very good. But our work here is very tiring, aren't you afraid of hardship, girl?"

    "If I was afraid of hardship, I wouldn't have come!"

    "That's good, we are short of a cultured girl like you!"

    A few days later, she went to the fields with the farm members to work and thresh grain. At first, she was covered in sweat after working for a while, her legs were shaking with exhaustion, and her hands were also broken. When she was very tired, she asked herself: "Can I persevere?" She immediately remembered her determination when she first came, and the heroic image of the master in the book "The Road to Communism" working hard to build a collective farm also appeared before her eyes. Thinking of these things, the courage to overcome difficulties came: "Others can overcome difficulties, why can't I? People who cannot overcome difficulties are not people with strong wills!" In this way, she persisted in fighting against difficulties.

    Recently, she studied the general line of the state during the transition period, and her life became even more energetic. She works in the daytime, teaches night school in the evening, and tells the women about the general line and the prospects of the motherland's countryside, and she is busy all day long. But she doesn't feel tired, she said: "Since studying the general line, I have become more confident and more determined. I am determined to work hard with the farm members to build our farm, so that the farm will be mechanized sooner."

    参加黎明集体农庄的一个初中毕业生
    根全　玉星
    几个月以前，吉林省黎明集体农庄来了一个初中毕业生。她叫梁玉女，十九岁，是汪清县石岘造纸厂一个工人家庭的姑娘。她是在初中毕业后自己要求到农庄来的。她来到农庄以后就跟庄员们一块打场、盖牛舍，帮会计整理账目，教夜学和做其它工作。
      美好的理想
    梁玉女在中学的时候，从课文里知道了苏联农民的幸福生活。看了电影“金星英雄”以后，一闭上眼睛，苏联农民愉快地驾驶拖拉机耕地、打谷机打场的情景，就一一浮现在她的眼前。在她耳边不时响着老师的那句话：“苏联的今天就是我们的明天”。她想到祖国农村的将来，就联想到自己未来的事业，她想：“将来我要做什么呢？”她给自己作了这么个结论：“我要到农村去，去建设像苏联那样的农村！”
    去年春天，全体同学都到龙盛村去参观农业生产合作社。一走进龙盛村的村头，生产合作社连成大片的土地就映入她的眼帘。在一望无边的土地上，社员们正用木犁翻地。她瞅着这块土地呆住了，她自言自语地说：“一片多么好的土地呀，在这样一块肥沃的土地上，开起拖拉机来，该多么幸福啊！”从这，她更加热爱农村，更加向往祖国农村的未来了。
    参加农业生产的愿望达到了
    去年七月，梁玉女一班的学生快要毕业了。同学们都谈论自己的未来：有的要升高中；有的说要到地质学校去；有的要到工业专科学校去等等。
    一天，老师分发给学生们“希望表”。梁玉女接过来，像早已经考虑好了似的，很快地写下了这么两条：“我的希望是：第一，到农业技术学校去；第二，到农村去。”后来她还是决定到农村去。
    一天，她的哥哥梁珆婴来了。梁玉女把自己的理想跟哥哥说了，最后她问：“你说，上农村去，需要什么手续呀？”
    “你想得很好。我看还是请示政府考虑分配好些。”梁珆婴继续说：“不过农村工作很苦啊，困难也很多，得有很坚强的意志。”他说着掏出了“走向共产主义的道路”一本书给她说：“你好好读它，一定会对你有很大帮助！”
    梁玉女接受了她哥哥的意见，写了一封信给延边朝鲜民族自治区人民政府朱主席。过了十几天后，自治区政府通知她：自治区人民政府已经批准她到黎明集体农庄去。她接到通知后，高兴地跳了起来，她说：“我的希望终于实现了！”
   “不能在困难面前低头”
    去年十月二十七日傍晚，她到农庄来了。庄员们亲切地欢迎她，跟她握手。一个姓张的老大娘感动地问她：“你为啥到这来呢？”
    “为了跟你们一块建设像苏联一样美好的农村。”梁玉女笑着回答。
    “很好。可是我们这活很累呀，你不怕吃苦吗，姑娘？”
    “怕吃苦我就不来了！”
    “那好，我们正缺少像你这样有文化的姑娘哩！”
    过了几天，她跟庄员们一块下地做活、打场了。开始时，她干一会儿活就满身是汗，累得腿直哆嗦，手也弄破了。她在很累的时候就问自己：“能坚持下去吗？”她又立刻想起她刚来时的决心，“走向共产主义的道路”一书中的主人艰苦努力建设集体农庄的英雄形象，也在她眼前浮现出来。她想到这些，克服困难的勇气就来了：“人家都能克服困难，自己为什么不能呢？不能克服困难的人，就不是意志坚强的人！”就这样，她坚持向困难作斗争。
    最近，她学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线，她的生活更有生气了。白天干活，晚上教夜学，给妇女们讲总路线，讲祖国农村的远景，一天到晚忙个不停。可是她却不觉累，她说：“从学习总路线以后，信心就更足了，决心就更大啦。我决心跟庄员们一块艰苦努力，建设我们的农庄，使农庄早一天机械化。”
