    Wuxiang County Partition Holds Mutual Aid and Cooperation Representative Meeting to Discuss Preparations for Establishing Agricultural Cooperatives

    At the end of last year, Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, held a representative meeting on mutual aid and cooperation by partition. The meeting was attended by 318 people, including old cooperative chairmen, chairmen of newly established cooperatives, and mutual aid team leaders preparing to establish cooperatives. The meeting was personally presided over by the county and district committees. The focus of the meeting was to review the previous winter production and discuss preparations for establishing new agricultural production cooperatives.

    Last winter, various agricultural production cooperatives formulated winter production plans, deeply publicized the general line, and carried out specific organizational work. Many cooperatives have already achieved remarkable results in winter production. According to statistics from 139 agricultural production cooperatives: a total of more than 4.15 million dan of manure was accumulated, accounting for 62% of the fertilizer needed in 1954, and more than 530,000 dan of fertilizer had been delivered to the fields; four wells, 85 cattle pits, and five reservoirs were built, nine flood prevention channels were opened, 3,215 zhang of side embankments were repaired, soil improvement work was carried out on 50 mu of land, and various workshops and sideline production such as small handicrafts and transportation were organized, generating a total income of 18.91 million yuan and 27,840 jin of sesame cakes. These cooperatives actively sold surplus grain to expand production. According to statistics from 13 cooperatives in the Fifth District, 33.7% of the money earned from selling surplus grain was used to expand reproduction.

    However, the development of the winter production movement was uneven, with 31 agricultural production cooperatives becoming sluggish and drifting along. The main reasons were that district and township cadres only focused on grain purchase work and neglected specific leadership over winter production. In particular, some townships not only did not assign district and township cadres to specifically lead winter production, but also pulled all the cooperative affairs cadres of the agricultural production cooperatives to do purchase work, completely ignoring winter production. Secondly, the autumn harvest distribution in some cooperatives had not been completely concluded, and unresolved issues affected the production morale of the members. Thirdly, a method for recording work points and distributing dividends had not been determined, which made the members lack confidence in engaging in winter production. Through the review at the meeting, everyone realized the seriousness of the problem ideologically, and felt that if winter production preparations were not done well, the 1954 production increase plan would fall through. The meeting, in response to the above situation, studied ways to continue to deeply carry out the winter production movement.

    In order to build new cooperatives well, achieve success in every established cooperative, and enable agricultural production cooperatives to develop healthily, in addition to organizing the chairmen of newly established agricultural production cooperatives and the leaders of mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives to study the agricultural production cooperative charter, old cooperative chairmen were also invited to share their experience in establishing cooperatives at this meeting, which powerfully helped the work of establishing cooperatives. For example, after the 19 new cooperative chairmen and mutual aid team leaders in the Fifth District listened to Li Fawang, chairman of the Lower City Old Cooperative, Cui Zhihe, chairman of the Lizhuang Cooperative, and others introduce their experience in ideological mobilization, reviewing members, electing cooperative cadres, land shares, and labor evaluation in establishing cooperatives, they felt that they had found a clear path. The Yan Quancheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shangcheng was newly established in November last year. After the establishment of the cooperative, many problems could not be solved, and there was no way to price the fertilizer delivered to the field. The oil mill had already started pressing oil, and the fertilizer had been delivered to the field, but it was not known how many work points to record. After the chairman of the cooperative listened to the old cooperative chairman introduce his experience, he planned to go back and learn from the experience of the Lower City Old Cooperative, price the fertilizer according to the quality and enter it into the cooperative, and adopt a small contracted work method for oil mills and fertilizer delivery. The Niu Xingwang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Niujiazhuang was also newly established last winter. Previously, it was believed that there was no way to proceed without the public ownership of cattle. After listening to the old cooperative introduce its experience, Niu Xingwang planned to go back and adopt a leasing and employment method through democratic discussion among the members, with the cattle still privately owned by the members and the cooperative paying for the lease and employment. After a mutual aid team leader in Qicun who was preparing to establish a cooperative studied the agricultural production cooperative charter and listened to the old cooperative chairman introduce his experience in establishing a cooperative, he re-examined the thoughts of the farmers who had signed up to join the cooperative and realized that the previous ideological mobilization work had not been done enough, and that he would go back to conduct in-depth publicity and carefully review the members. Wu Guichang, a mutual aid team leader in Chengguan Town who was preparing to establish a cooperative, studied the old cooperative's experience in establishing a cooperative in production. Based on the lack of fuel in Chengguan, he planned to first organize the team members to pull coal and establish a cooperative in production. Through the introduction of experience in establishing cooperatives by the old cooperatives, the meeting also corrected everyone's conservative and adventurous thinking.

    However, after the old cooperative chairmen introduced their experience, some mutual aid team leaders who were preparing to establish cooperatives felt that the work of agricultural production cooperatives was very complicated and troublesome, and they were afraid and unwilling to be cooperative chairmen. After re-organizing the study of the general line and the re-introduction of experience by the old cooperative chairmen, they were relieved of their ideological concerns. On this basis, the agricultural production cooperative transmission station was improved. A total of 95 agricultural production cooperative transmission stations were organized throughout the county, stipulating that the old cooperatives should go to the new cooperatives to transmit experience twice during the establishment of the cooperative, and twice a month after the establishment of the cooperative. Through the transmission station, the old cooperatives can drive the new cooperatives to develop together.

    武乡县分区召开互助合作代表会议
    讨论建立农业合作社的准备工作
    山西武乡县在去年年底，分区召开了互助合作代表会议。参加会议的有老社社长、新建社的社长和准备建社的互助组长，共三百一十八人。会议由县、区委亲自主持。会议的中心是检查前段的冬季生产，讨论新建农业生产合作社的准备工作。
    去年冬天，各个农业生产合作社曾制定了冬季生产计划，深入地宣传了总路线，进行了具体的组织工作，不少社冬季生产已经取得了显著成绩。据一百三十九个农业生产合作社的统计：共积肥四百一十五万余担，占一九五四年所需肥料的百分之六十二，已经送到地的肥料五十三万余担；打水井四眼、卧牛坑八十五个、蓄水池五个，开防洪渠九条，修边堰三千二百一十五丈，在五十亩地里进行了改良土壤的工作，开各种作坊及组织小手工业、运输业等副业生产，共收入一千八百九十一万元和麻饼二万七千八百四十斤。这些社积极卖余粮扩大生产，据五区十三个社统计，卖余粮所得的钱有百分之三十三点七用在扩大再生产上。
    但是，冬季生产运动发展不平衡，有三十一个农业生产合作社冬季生产消沉自流。主要的原因是区、乡干部只顾粮食收购工作，忽视了对冬季生产的具体领导，特别是有的乡不只没有抽出区、乡干部专门领导冬季生产，而且把农业生产合作社的社务干部也全部拉去做收购工作，根本没有管过冬季生产。其次，是有些社的秋收分配还没有完全结束，遗留问题没有解决，影响了社员们的生产情绪。第三，是没有确定记工分红办法，致使社员对搞冬季生产的信心不足。会议通过检查，大家从思想上认识了问题的严重性，都感到如果冬季作不好生产准备，一九五四年的增产计划就要落空。会议针对以上情况，研究了继续深入开展冬季生产运动的办法。
    为了把新社建好，达到办一个成一个，使农业生产合作社健康地发展，在这次会议上，除组织新建的农业生产合作社社长及准备建社的互助组组长学习了农业生产合作社章程以外，还请老社社长传授了建社经验，有力地帮助了建社工作。如五区十九个新社长和互助组长，听了下城老社社长李发旺、李庄社社长崔致和等介绍建社中的思想动员、审查社员、选举社里干部、土地入股、劳力评工等办社经验后，觉得有了一条明路。上城阎全成农业生产合作社是去年十一月份新建的，建社后好多问题找不出办法解决，肥料送到地里也没有办法作价，油坊已开始榨油，肥已送到地里，但不知道记多少工。该社社长听了老社社长介绍经验以后，计划回去要学习下城老社经验，肥料按质量好坏分等作价入社，油坊、送肥等工要采用小包工办法。牛家庄牛兴旺农业生产合作社也是去冬新建的，以前认为耕牛不公有就没有办法了，听了老社介绍经验，牛兴旺计划回去要通过社员民主讨论，采用租用雇用办法，耕牛仍归社员私有，社里出价租用雇用。祁村准备建社的一位互助组长学习了农业生产合作社章程和听了老社社长介绍建社经验后，重新研究了报名入社农民的思想，认识了以前思想动员工作做得不够，回去要深入进行宣传，认真审查社员。城关镇准备建社的互助组长武贵昌，学习了老社在生产中办社的经验，他根据城关燃料缺乏的情况，计划首先组织组员们拉煤，在生产中建社。会议经过老社介绍建社经验，还纠正了大家的保守和冒进思想。
    但是，经过老社社长介绍经验，有些准备建社的互助组长，又感到农业生产合作社的工作很复杂、很麻烦，思想上怕起来，不愿意当社长了。经过再次组织学习总路线和老社社长的再次介绍经验，他们才解除了思想顾虑。在这个基础上，健全了农业生产合作社传授站。全县共组织了九十五个农业生产合作社传授站，规定在建社中，老社去新社传授二次，建社后每月传授二次。通过传授站，老社便可带动新社共同向前发展。
