Several Experiences in Adult Education for Cadres in Hebei Province
    Hebei Provincial People's Government Education Department

　　The majority of current cadres in Hebei Province joined the workforce during the Anti-Japanese War. They possess substantial work experience, but their general education level is relatively low. According to statistics from 1950, the vast majority of cadres in the province had a language proficiency level equivalent to or below that of upper primary school, and their arithmetic skills were even weaker. Many were unable to understand statistical figures, and some were illiterate. This situation hindered the improvement of cadres' work abilities and the smooth progress of various tasks.

　　In light of this situation, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party stipulated that cadres whose education level was below junior middle school graduation should primarily focus on cultural補習, aiming to raise illiterate cadres to the level of lower primary school graduates and those with lower primary or junior middle school education to the levels of upper primary and junior middle school graduates, respectively, within two to three years. After the rectification campaign in September 1950, this decision was widely implemented throughout the province. The Provincial People's Government Education Department also established a specialized agency (the Cadre Education Office) and initially stipulated the school system and curriculum. Cadre adult education schools were successively established in agencies at and above the county level. With the increase in the number of agency staff, the scale of the schools grew. In terms of student numbers, there were 58,192 students in 1950, which increased to over 80,000 in 1951, and reached 144,961 by the summer of 1953. More than 95% of cadres in the province below junior middle school level participated in learning. After several years of effort, most of the adult education schools at all levels have been put on the right track, conducting teaching according to a unified school system and curriculum, and have a fairly complete set of attendance, homework, leave, examination, promotion, graduation and other systems. Some experience has also been created in teaching methods. Among cadres at and above the county level participating in cultural learning, except for those going to the countryside, usually 80% can attend classes on time, basically eliminating the phenomenon of absenteeism without reason.

　　The gains from cadre cultural learning over the past three years are mainly reflected in the following three aspects:

　　First, cadres' cultural level has been improved. According to statistics from the end of 1952, among the 18,021 illiterate cadres in the province, 15,376 had undergone accelerated literacy learning, achieving a literacy level of around 2,000 characters, able to read popular books and newspapers, and write simple letters and reports, basically breaking away from illiteracy. According to incomplete statistics from the end of 1952 in Fengrun, Linyu, Anci, Daming, Handan five counties and Shijiazhuang and Handan two cities, among 7,459 people, 2,086 cadres who were originally illiterate (winter of 1950) had already studied the upper primary school curriculum; 2,544 cadres who originally only had lower primary school grades 1 and 2 had reached the upper primary school graduation level; 2,825 people had moved from upper primary classes to junior middle school classes. The 366 cadres in the Provincial Direct Organs Adult Education School who never missed classes began participating in junior middle school learning in the winter of 1950 and completed courses in language, arithmetic, algebra, physics, chemistry, etc., by the summer vacation of 1953 (two years and ten months), all graduating. As of March 1953, there were 8,600 graduates from upper primary school classes and 743 graduates from junior middle school classes in the province. By the end of 1953, approximately nearly 20,000 people had completed upper primary and junior middle school courses respectively.

　　Second, due to the continuous improvement of cultural levels, cadres' confidence in their work has been enhanced, and the pessimistic emotions and retirement thoughts of some cadres due to low cultural levels have been corrected.

　　Third, the cadres' knowledge domains have been expanded, and they have been liberated from ideological narrowness to varying degrees, enhancing their ability to accept new things and analyze and judge, thus greatly improving work efficiency.

　　The above achievements show that it is possible for cadres to learn culture well using their spare time.

　　After several years of practice in cadre cultural education, we have realized that cadres participating in adult cultural learning do have their own distinct characteristics: 1. They have rich perceptual knowledge and a certain amount of political common sense, a high political level, a low cultural level, strong comprehension, and poor memory; they have an urgent desire to learn and are eager to succeed. 2. They have heavy work tasks, and learning is carried out in their spare time. If the two are not well combined, conflicts will arise; frequent visits to the countryside and high mobility will make it difficult to keep up with classes. 3. Cadres participating in learning differ in terms of the nature of their work, experience in struggle, cultural level, personal requirements, and hobbies. 4. The requirements for teachers are high, some are old, sloppy, and do not respect teachers enough, making management relatively difficult.

　　These situations illustrate that doing a good job in the cultural learning of in-service cadres is a very complex and arduous task. Therefore, curriculum settings, teaching organization, and methods need to be constantly researched and improved based on the actual characteristics of in-service cadres' spare-time learning. Our main experiences in teaching work are:

　　(1) Doing a good job in class placement and establishing various necessary systems within the school is a prerequisite for the smooth progress of teaching. Generally, cadres' language knowledge level is higher than their mathematical and physical knowledge level, and there is also a great disparity in their levels in various subjects. In the past, the class placement method required by regular schools for similar levels in various subjects caused many difficulties. Later, through gradual exploration, it was changed to the "subject-based class placement" method. Now, cadre adult education schools directly under the provincial government, Tangshan Special District, and some counties are piloting the method of "single-subject teaching, subject-based graduation." The main advantages of this class placement method are: concentrated time, easy to achieve rapid results; fewer threads, concentrated energy, easy to teach, easy to understand, easy to remember, suitable for the characteristics of busy work, little time, and high mobility of in-service cadres. This also overcomes the shortcomings of neglecting one thing while attending to another or mutual influence. At the same time, it can also appropriately take care of the different learning requirements of cadres with different work natures. This is a better class placement method for adult education schools.

　　In order to run the school well, various necessary teaching systems should be established. These systems should generally be formulated through democratic methods and guaranteed by the agency for execution.

　　(2) Curriculum settings should be streamlined and concentrated. In 1950, our province made such a decision on curriculum settings: lower primary school should offer language and arithmetic; upper primary school should offer language, arithmetic, and common sense (including social common sense, natural common sense); junior middle school should offer language, history, geography, algebra, geometry, natural history, chemistry, physics and other courses. However, in the specific implementation, due to the lack of suitable teaching materials, the purpose and requirements of each subject's teaching were not clear, and most teachers were not familiar with the learning characteristics of cadres, so the progress was very slow, and students generally felt that the curriculum was heavy and could not complete the teaching tasks. At the same time, due to too many types of courses, they could not be digested, and the learning period was too long, which also made students lose confidence. The teaching effect was very poor. In addition, special district and county-level agencies are often limited by equipment and teacher conditions, and some courses are difficult to set up. Therefore, in 1951, primary school common sense, junior middle school physics and chemistry were cancelled; natural history was changed to physiology and hygiene. According to the current situation, the types of courses can still be appropriately streamlined. As for cadres in certain technical departments who need more specialized knowledge, they should supplement what is lacking after mastering basic cultural knowledge, or use self-study methods to solve the problem. Therefore, we believe that the compulsory courses in cadre adult education schools should be language and mathematics. At the same time, elective classes in physics, chemistry, history, geography, etc., can be offered according to the needs of students, teachers, material equipment conditions, and work, so that they have the opportunity to elect the subjects they need.

　　(3) In teaching, the principles of linking with reality and applying what is learned should be adopted. For example, teaching students how to write work summaries and reports through language classes, and practicing calculating percentages and price indexes through mathematics classes, will be more effective. To this end, teachers must prepare lessons thoroughly in advance, and when teaching, they must grasp the center and link with reality to make it easier for students to accept.

　　(4) It is necessary to do a good job in the learning and make-up work of cadres who go to the countryside. Generally speaking, about 20% of cadres in provinces and cities often go to the countryside, and about 40% or more in special districts and counties. In order to prevent the cultural learning of these cadres from being delayed too much, we have adopted methods such as pre-lecture, self-study and mutual assistance, regular make-up classes, and correspondence guidance to remedy the situation. For example, the Shijiazhuang Special District Adult Education School conducts pre-lectures for a certain period of time (depending on the length of the trip to the countryside) before cadres go to the countryside. The purpose is to solve the difficulties of self-study in the countryside, and to issue students with study outlines so that they can self-study in their work. In addition, it is best to unify learning and work through leadership, so that the work team becomes a learning mutual aid group. If you encounter difficulties, ask the local adult education school teachers and primary school teachers or write to the original agency adult education school for answers. After returning to the agency, you must submit homework, which the teacher will carefully mark, and conduct make-up classes with emphasis.

　　河北省干部业余文化教育工作的几点经验
    河北省人民政府教育厅
    河北省现有在职干部，大部分是在抗日战争时期参加工作的，具有相当丰富的工作经验，但文化水平一般很低。以一九五○年的统计来看，全省干部绝大多数是高小以下的语文水平，算术程度更低，多数弄不清统计数字，并有一部分文盲。这种情况，妨碍了干部工作能力的提高和各项工作的顺利完成。
    鉴于这种情况，中共河北省委规定凡文化程度不够初中毕业程度者，一般均以补习文化为主，要求在二、三年内把干部中的文盲，提高到初小毕业程度，把已具有初小和初中肄业程度的，分别提高到高小、初中毕业的程度。一九五○年九月整风后，这一决定在全省各地普遍贯彻。省人民政府教育厅并建立了专管机构（干部教育处），初步规定了学制和课程。县以上各级机关均先后举办了干部业余文化学校。随着机关工作人员的增加，学校规模日益发展，从学员数字看，一九五○年为五万八千一百九十二人，一九五一年增至八万余人，到一九五三年夏天，即达到十四万四千九百六十一人。全省不到初中程度的干部百分之九十五以上参加了学习。经过几年的努力，各级业余文化学校大部分已走上正轨，按照统一的学制、课程进行教学，有了一套相当完整的考勤、作业、请假、考试、升级、结业等制度。在教学方法上也创造了一些经验。县级以上机关参加文化学习的干部，除下乡者外，经常有百分之八十能按时到课，基本上消灭了无故旷课的现象。
    三年来干部文化学习的收获，主要表现在以下三个方面：
    首先，提高了干部的文化水平。根据一九五二年年底的统计，在全省一万八千零二十一个文盲干部中，已有一万五千三百七十六人经过速成识字学习，识字达二千左右，能阅读通俗书报，能写简单书信和报告，基本上脱离了文盲状态。据丰润、临榆、安次、大名、邯郸五县及石家庄、邯郸两市一九五二年底不完全的统计，在七千四百五十九人中，有二千零八十六名原来（一九五○年冬）是文盲的干部，已经学习了高小的课程；有二千五百四十四人原来只有初小一、二年级程度的干部，已经达到高小毕业程度；有二千八百二十五人由高小班进入了初中班。省直属机关干部业余文化学校常年不缺课的三百六十六人，自一九五○年冬开始参加初中学习，至一九五三年暑假（二年零十个月），学完语文、算术、代数、物理、化学等科，全部毕业。截至一九五三年三月，全省高小班毕业者有八千六百人，初中班毕业者有七百四十三人，至一九五三年年底，约有近两万人分别学完高小和初中的课程。
    其次，由于文化水平的不断提高，增强了干部的工作信心，纠正了一部分干部由于文化低所产生的悲观情绪和退休思想。
    再次，扩大了干部的知识领域，不同程度地摆脱了思想上的狭隘性，提高了他们接受新鲜事物和分析判断的能力，因而大大地提高了工作效率。
    以上成绩说明：在职干部利用业余时间学习文化，是可以学好的。
    经过几年干部文化教育工作的实践，我们体会到：参加业余文化学习的在职干部确有其不同的特点：一、有丰富的感性知识和一定的政治常识，政治水平高，文化水平低，理解力强，记忆力较差；学习要求迫切，急于求成。二、工作任务重，学习又在业余时间进行，两者结合不好，就会发生矛盾；经常下乡，流动性大，学习抓不紧，就会发生跟不上班的现象。三、参加学习的干部，在工作性质、斗争经验、文化水平、个人要求和爱好等方面，都不相同。四、对教师要求高，有的表现老大、散漫，对教师尊重不够，管理比较不易。
    这些情况，说明搞好在职干部的文化学习是一件很复杂很艰巨的工作。因此，课程设置、教学组织和方法，均需从实际出发，根据在职干部业余学习的特点，不断地研究改进。我们在教学工作中的主要体验是：
    （一）作好编班工作，建立学校内各种必要的制度，是顺利进行教学的前提。一般干部的语文知识水平，高于数理知识水平，在各科程度上，悬殊也很大。过去采用正规学校要求各科程度差不多的编班方法，困难很多。后又在逐渐摸索中改为
  “分科编班”的办法。现在，省直属机关、唐山专区和部分县份的干部业余文化学校，又试行“单科教学、分科结业”的方法。这种编班方法的主要优点是：时间集中，容易速成；头绪少，精力集中，易教，易懂，易记，适合在职干部工作忙，时间少，流动性大的特点。这也克服了顾此失彼或互相影响的缺点。同时，对各种不同工作性质的干部的不同学习要求，也能适当照顾。这是业余文化学校较好的一种编班方法。
    为了办好学校，各种必要的教学制度，是应该建立的。这些制度，一般应通过民主方法制订，由机关保证执行。
      （二）课程设置，应做到精简集中。一九五○年本省曾对课程设置做过这样的决定：初小设语文和算术；高小设语文、算术和常识（包括社会常识、自然常识）；初中设语文、历史、地理、代数、几何、博物、化学、物理等课。但在具体实施当中，由于缺乏适用的教材，各科教学的目的要求不明确，绝大部分教师不熟悉干部的学习特点，因而进度很慢，学员一般感到课程分量重，不能完成教学任务。同时，由于课程门类太多，消化不了，学习期限又长，也使学员失掉信心。教学效果是很差的。另外在专区和县级机关往往受到设备和教师等条件的限制，有的课程，很难设置。因此，在一九五一年就将小学常识、初中物理、化学取消；博物改设生理卫生。依现在情况看来，在课程门类上，还可以适当精简。至于某些技术部门的干部，需要更多方面的专门知识，则应在掌握基础文化知识之后，再结合需要和可能，缺什么补什么；或采用自修方法，予以解决。因此，我们认为干部业余文化学校的必修课程，应为语文和数学。同时可以根据学员、教师和物质设备条件和工作的需要，开设物理、化学、历史、地理等科的选修班，使他们有机会选修自己所需要的学科。
      （三）在教学上，宜采取联系实际和学以致用的原则。如通过语文课教给学员如何写工作总结报告，通过数学课练习计算百分比和物价指数等，这样做，收效就大。为此，教师教学必须事先充分备课，讲时要做到抓住中心、联系实际，使学员易于接受。
      （四）必须搞好下乡干部的学习和补课工作。一般说，省市经常下乡的干部约在百分之二十左右，专区和县约在百分之四十以上。为使这些干部的文化学习不致耽误太多，我们曾采取预讲领课、自学互助，定期补课以及函授辅导等办法补救。如石家庄专区业余文化学校，在干部下乡前，以一定的时间（根据下乡日期长短而定）进行预讲。其目的在于解决下乡自学的困难，并发给学员学习提纲，以便在工作中自学。另外，最好通过领导，将学习和工作统一起来，使工作组成为学习互助组。遇到困难，则请教当地业余文化学校教员和小学教员或函请原机关业余文化学校解答。回机关后，必须交作业，由教师认真批改，并有重点地进行补课。
