	New Year has arrived in Korea again. This is the first New Year that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has spent in an environment without artillery fire and gunpowder smoke.
	On the afternoon of New Year's Eve, I came to the position of the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. I walked into the first decorated archway and saw a soldier from the first platoon hanging red, five-pointed star-shaped lanterns on the second archway. As soon as he saw me, he greeted me with a smile: "Comrade, you've come at the right time, welcome to our company to celebrate this peaceful and victorious New Year!" Looking in from the second archway, every barrack on the snowy hillside was decorated, like huge flowers blooming in the snow. Eye-catching red couplets were pasted all over the door frames: "Defend the New China, complete the Five-Year Plan; Follow the General Line, advance to Socialism." "Don't relax, don't be careless, maintain high vigilance; Study culture, practice military skills, strive for greater achievements."... Vivid Chinese and Korean national flags fluttered everywhere...
	Soldiers in groups of three or five were wiping their weapons in the red glow of the setting sun. Gao Lianglun, a Second-Class Combat Hero, told me: "The regimental leader is going to review the troops during the New Year. This morning, we went to the regiment for drills, and the deputy regimental leader praised us for making great progress in our military movements."
	I am familiar with this company. It is one of many heroic companies in the Volunteer Army. In the famous Battle of Shangganling, they annihilated nearly a thousand enemies, and more than sixty heroes and meritorious individuals emerged from the entire company, which was also collectively awarded the First Class Merit.
	The soldiers will never forget the Communist Party members Yang Guoliang and Zhou Ping.
	It was dawn on November 12, 1952, and the Battle of Shangganling was in full swing. An enemy platoon approached Yang Guoliang's squad's position. His comrade-in-arms, light machine gunner Xin Jiacai, sacrificed himself in the most critical moment. The enemy swarmed up. At this final moment, Yang Guoliang rushed into the enemy ranks with an explosive pack, perishing with the enemy and buying time to protect the position. Zhou Ping was a squad leader who continued to command the battle despite being seriously wounded several times. Finally, his intestines were blown out, and like a bloody figure, he struggled to carry the wounded machine gunner Liu Qingyun towards the bunker. He continued until he bled to death and finally closed his eyes.
	In order to mourn these strong and unyielding comrades-in-arms, the soldiers specially set up spiritual tablets for them and made sacrifices during the New Year.
	In the evening, I went to the first platoon. There, the soldiers were sitting around candlelight, sucking on candy, and writing letters attentively. When they saw me, they asked softly: "Look, are there any typos? Does it make sense?" Some of them only knew two or three hundred characters when the ceasefire was declared; now, they can pick up a pen and write simple letters. Some wrote to their parents, some to their wives, some to the model workers in the factories and villages of the motherland, and some even drew colorful New Year's cards. A soldier from the fourth squad told me meaningfully: "The motherland has already fired the first shot in the first Five-Year Plan, and progress is so fast! I want to write home and ask if they have sold their surplus grain to the state? Have they joined the production cooperative?"
	The New Year's Eve discussion began. The soldiers turned their attention to Gao Lianglun again, asking, "It's time to watch your movie again (the soldiers compared listening to the news of the motherland's construction to watching a movie)." It turned out that when Gao Lianglun returned to China during the National Day last year, he visited the seamless steel tube factory in Anshan and the Gaokan Village agricultural production cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang. After returning, the soldiers asked him to talk about the construction of the motherland several times. The more everyone listened, the more they felt the motherland was lovely, and they wanted to listen again and again. On New Year's Eve, the soldiers missed their motherland even more, so everyone felt that listening to Gao Lianglun talk about the construction of the motherland was even more meaningful.
	Gao Lianglun stood up, and anticipation appeared on every soldier's face. As Gao Lianglun spoke, he took out two copies of the People's Daily pictorial and pointed them out to everyone: "This is the scene of the Gaokan Village agricultural production cooperative selling surplus grain to the state, this is Comrade Zhang Zhenfa, the chairman of the cooperative, this is the scene of the seamless steel tube factory starting production..." A burst of applause shook the small grass house, mixed with the shouts of "Long live our great motherland."
	Outside the house, cheers and the sound of gongs and drums were constantly heard, but the people in the house were still talking about the motherland.
	Gao Lianglun leaned close to my ear and said, "Would you please help me write a letter to the comrades of the seamless steel tube factory and Gaokan Village? I have already asked the clerk comrade to help me draw New Year's cards to wish them a Happy New Year and congratulate them on their new victories on the production front. Tell them to produce and build with confidence! We are not careless, we are always vigilant! We are also studying the general line of the country during the transition period." I took out my pen and began to write a letter according to his wishes. He also said shyly, as if talking to himself, "In 1954, I am sure I will be able to write letters myself."
	It was late at night, and the north wind was blowing hard. The platoon leader urged everyone: "Go to sleep, we have to go to pay New Year's greetings to the leaders tomorrow and participate in the camp's cultural and entertainment meeting and basketball game!" However, the soldiers were still talking endlessly, beginning to recall the past hard battle life. The soldiers remembered that on New Year's Eve in 1952, they were still on the cold peaks of the Jincheng front, digging communication trenches one pickaxe after another, and enemy shells were constantly exploding around them. Now, however, everyone is quietly eating the milk candy, coffee candy, apples, and melon seeds sent by the motherland, and smoking the cigarettes sent by the motherland. Motherland, it is you who supported us in achieving victory, it is you who have brought us endless strength! For your prosperity and strength, we will always defend you!

    阵地新年
    聂勋材
    新年又来到了朝鲜。这是中国人民志愿军在没有炮火和硝烟的环境中度过的第一个新年。
    除夕的午后，我来到了志愿军某部第九连的阵地上。我走进第一道彩门，看到一排的一个战士，正在第二道彩门上挂红五星型的灯笼。一看到我，他就笑着招呼起来：“同志，来得正好，欢迎你到咱连里过这个和平胜利年！”从第二道彩门望进去，在那留有积雪的山坡上，每一间营房都打扮起来了，好像雪地上怒放的巨大鲜花一样。耀眼的大红对联贴满了门框：“保卫新中国，完成五年计划；按照总路线，走到社会主义。”“不松懈，不麻痹，保持高度警惕；学文化，练武艺，争取功上加功。”……一幅幅鲜艳的中朝国旗，到处迎风飘扬……。
    战士们三五成群，正在夕阳的红光中擦拭武器。二级战斗英雄高良伦告诉我：“团首长要在过年的时候检阅队伍。上午，我们才到团里会了操，副团长还表扬我们军事动作又有了很大进步。”
    我熟悉这个连队，这是志愿军里很多英雄连队中间的一个，在著名的上甘岭战斗中，他们曾歼灭了近千个敌人，全连共出现了六十多个英雄和功臣，还集体立了一等功。
    战士们永远忘不了共产党员杨国良和周平。
    那是一九五二年十一月十二日的拂晓，上甘岭战斗正在激烈地进行着。敌人一个排的兵力，逼近了杨国良小组的阵地，他的战友、轻机枪射手辛家才在最紧张的时候牺牲了，敌人拥了上来，杨国良在这最后关头，抱着爆破筒冲向了敌群；和敌人同归于尽，争取了时间，保住了阵地。周平，是个班长，他负了几次重伤，还坚持指挥战斗。最后，肠子被打出来了，像个血人一样，还背着负伤的机枪手刘庆云艰难地往掩体里爬行。一直到他流尽了热血，最后闭上了眼睛。
    为了悼念这些坚强不屈的战友，在过新年的时候，战士们还特地给他们设立了灵位，做了祭奠。
    傍晚，我到了一排。那里，战士们正围着烛光，吮着糖，用心地写信。他们一见我来，就轻轻地问：“你看，有别字没有？通不通？”他们有的在停战的时候，仅仅认识两三百个字；现在，却能提起笔来写简单的信了。有的给父母亲写，有的给妻子写，有的给祖国的工厂和农村的模范们写，有的还画了彩色的贺年片。四班的一个战士意味深长地告诉我：“祖国，已经打响了第一个五年建设计划的头一炮，进步真快呀！我要写信问一问家里，把余粮卖给国家没有？参加生产合作社没有？”
    除夕的座谈会开始了。战士们又把注意力集中到高良伦身上，要求说：“这次又该看你的电影了
  （战士们把听祖国建设的情形比做看电影）。”原来高良伦于去年国庆节回国时，曾参观了鞍山的无缝钢管厂和沈阳市郊的高坎村农业生产合作社。回来后，战士们好几次叫他谈祖国的建设情形，大家越听越觉得祖国的可爱，听了一遍还想听一遍。除夕之夜，战士们更怀念起祖国，所以大家觉得听高良伦谈祖国建设更有了新的意义。
    高良伦站起来了，每个战士的脸上露出期待的神情，高良伦一边说着，一边拿出两份人民日报画刊指给大家看：“这就是高坎村农业生产合作社把余粮卖给国家的情形，这就是社的主席张振发同志，这就是无缝钢管厂开工生产的情形……”一阵掌声震动着小小的草房，夹杂着“我们伟大的祖国万岁”的口号声。
    房子外面，不时传来了欢呼声、锣鼓声，可是，屋子里的人们仍在谈论着祖国。
    高良伦凑近我的耳朵说：“你帮我写一封信给无缝钢管厂和高坎村的同志们好不好？我已请文书同志帮我画好了贺年片给他们拜年，祝贺他们在生产战线上的新的胜利。告诉他们，放心地生产建设吧！我们没有麻痹，时时警惕着哩！我们也在学习国家过渡时期的总路线。”我拿出钢笔来，开始照着他的意思写信，他又不好意思地仿佛自言自语地说：“一九五四年，我，保险能够自己写信了。”
    夜深了，北风呼呼地吹着，排长催促大家：“睡吧，明天还要去给首长拜年，参加全营的文娱大会和篮球比赛哩！”可是，战士们仍海阔天空地谈个不休，开始回忆起过去艰苦的战斗生活。战士们记得一九五二年除夕的晚上，他们还在金城前线的寒冷的山峰上，一镐接一镐地挖交通沟，敌人的炮弹还不时地在他们身边爆炸。现在呢，大家却安静地吃着祖国送来的牛奶糖、咖啡糖、苹果和瓜子，抽着祖国送来的香烟。祖国啊，是你支援着我们取得了胜利，是你，给我们带来了无穷的力量！为了你的繁荣富强，我们要永远捍卫着你！
