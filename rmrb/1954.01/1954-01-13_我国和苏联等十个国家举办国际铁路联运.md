China and the Soviet Union, as well as North Korea, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and nine other people's democratic countries, will hold international railway joint transportation from January 1954, handling international railway passenger and freight joint transportation. China has decided to designate nine stations, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, Manzhouli, Dalian, Andong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, as passenger joint transportation stations. The implementation of joint transportation will further facilitate transportation between China and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and will further promote the development of international trade and the exchange of cultures between countries.

In terms of passenger joint transportation, the joint transportation countries will operate international passenger trains and issue through tickets. China is preparing to first operate a direct passenger train between Beijing and Moscow in the near future. The trial operation train from Moscow arrived in Beijing on December 7, 1953, and the test run was in good condition. This train travels 9,050 kilometers, taking nine days and nights, and is the longest direct passenger train in the world. In terms of freight joint transportation, the scope of railway joint transportation between China and the Soviet Union in April 1951 has been expanded, and the procedures are much simpler than before.

In order to do a good job in joint transportation, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government of China held a training class for joint transportation business personnel in Harbin, and the various railway administrations also organized studies on joint transportation business, with a total of more than 1,000 people participating in the studies nationwide.

    我国和苏联等十个国家举办国际铁路联运
   【本报讯】我国和苏联及朝鲜、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等九个人民民主国家，从一九五四年一月起举办国际铁路联运，办理国际铁路旅客及货物联运。我国已决定将北京、天津、沈阳、哈尔滨、满洲里、大连、安东、上海、广州等九个车站作为旅客联运车站。实行联运后，我国和苏联及各人民民主国家的交通更加便利，并将进一步促进国际贸易的发展和各国文化的交流。
    旅客联运方面，联运各国将开行国际旅客列车，并且发售直通客票。我国准备首先与苏联在最近开行北京、莫斯科之间的直达旅客列车。从莫斯科开来的试运转的列车，已经在一九五三年十二月七日到达北京，试车情况良好。这趟列车全程九千零五十公里，走行九昼夜，是世界上里程最长的直达旅客列车。货物联运方面，比一九五一年四月间我国与苏联举办的铁路联运范围扩大了，手续也比以前简便多了。
    为了做好联运工作，我中央人民政府铁道部曾在哈尔滨举办了联运业务人员训练班，各管理局也分别组织了关于联运业务的学习，全国参加学习的约有一千多人。
