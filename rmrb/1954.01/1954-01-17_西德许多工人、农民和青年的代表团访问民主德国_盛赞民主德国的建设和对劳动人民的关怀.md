Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th: Recently, many West German workers', farmers', and youth delegations have visited the German Democratic Republic. In the six weeks around the New Year, more than thirty West German workers' delegations visited the German Democratic Republic. These delegations generally praised the construction of the German Democratic Republic and the government's concern for the interests of the working people.

    After visiting the mining areas of the German Democratic Republic, a West German miners' delegation expressed their impressions, stating that the members unanimously believed that they had learned about the situation in the mining areas of the Democratic Germany without hindrance and carefully, and what they saw was something they had not expected. A West German coal miner said: "We can feel that the miners of Mansfeld maintain close ties with their enterprises, the government, and the intellectual circles. My feelings are so deep that it is almost difficult to express them correctly in words." A West German old miner who has worked underground for more than 30 years, worried that he would soon be dismissed due to old age, said: In my conversation with you, I see your happiness, because the government cares about you and tries to improve your working conditions.

    Workers from the West German "Baden Aniline and Soda Factory" who were invited by the "Walter Ulbricht" Leuna factory to visit the German Democratic Republic particularly pointed out that equal pay for equal work has been implemented for female workers in the German Democratic Republic. In their factory, women who do the same work as male workers receive 30 percent less pay than male workers. When they visited the Leuna factory, it happened to be the time when the Soviet authorities handed over the factory to the Democratic Germany, which made a deep impression on them. They witnessed with their own eyes the Soviet Union handing over the factory, equipped with the latest machines, to the German people.

    A delegation of farmers and agricultural workers from Bavaria and Württemberg in West Germany issued a statement after visiting the German Democratic Republic, pointing out that the government of the German Democratic Republic showed special concern for agriculture. In West Germany, thousands of farms have become victims of war preparations. The statement also pointed out that the democratic land reform implemented in the German Democratic Republic protects the survival of small and medium farmers. In the German Democratic Republic, farmers will not encounter difficulties in selling agricultural products like West German farmers, be forced to be exploited in war industries, join mercenary armies, or even leave Germany.

    A West German youth delegation issued a statement after visiting the German Democratic Republic, saying: "When we set off to visit, we each had our own views on the German Democratic Republic. In West Germany, we often heard rumors and believed some of them. Therefore, we were very surprised when we saw the life of the German Democratic Republic. We cannot express the vivid impressions we have gained in words." The statement pointed out that they saw that students in the Democratic Germany received extensive care. The situation in West Germany is just the opposite. Many young people are unemployed, and young people do not have the opportunity to study, because the Adenauer government does not want to help young people, but only wants to turn young people into soldiers and use young people for military purposes. The statement stated that they will tell the West German youth the truth about life in the German Democratic Republic.

    西德许多工人、农民和青年的代表团访问民主德国
    盛赞民主德国的建设和对劳动人民的关怀
    【新华社十六日讯】柏林消息：最近一个时期，许多西德工人、农民与青年的代表团访问了德意志民主共和国。在新年前后的六个星期中，到德意志民主共和国访问的西德工人代表团就有三十多个。这些代表团普遍赞扬德意志民主共和国的建设和政府对劳动人民利益的关怀。
    西德矿工代表团在访问了德意志民主共和国的矿区后发表观感说，团员们一致认为，他们不受阻碍地和仔细地了解了民主德国矿区的情况，他们所看到的东西是他们所没有预料到的。一个西德挖煤工人说：“我们可以感到，曼斯费尔德的矿工是和他们的企业、政府以及知识界保持着紧密的联系的。我的感触很深，几乎难以用言语把它正确地表达出来。”一个担忧他不久将会因年老而被辞退、已经在地下工作了三十多年的西德老矿工说：和你们的谈话中，我看到你们的快乐，因为政府关怀你们，并且竭力改进你们的劳动条件。
    应“瓦尔特·乌布利希”洛埃纳工厂的邀请到民主德国参观的西德“巴登苯胺和苏打厂”的工人特别指出，在民主德国，已经对女工实行了同工同酬，而在他们的工厂里，和男工作同样工作的妇女得到的工资要比男工少百分之三十。他们在洛埃纳工厂参观的时候，刚好是苏联当局把该厂移交给民主德国的时候，这使他们获得了深刻的印象，他们亲眼见到了苏联把用最新的机器装备起来的工厂移交给德国人民。
    来自西德的巴伐利亚州和瓦登堡州的一个农民与农业工人代表团在民主德国参观后发表声明指出，民主德国政府对农业表示了特别的关心，而在西德，成千的农庄已经成为准备战争的牺牲品。声明并指出，在民主德国所实行的民主的土地改革是保护中小农民的生存的。在民主德国，农民们不会像西德农民那样遭到农产品销售的困难，被迫到战争工业中受剥削、加入雇佣军，甚至于离开德国。
    一个西德青年代表团在访问民主德国后发表声明说：“当我们动身来访问的时候，我们对于德意志民主共和国各有各的看法。在西德，我们经常听到谣言，并相信了其中的一部分。因此，当我们看到了德意志民主共和国的生活以后，我们感到很惊奇，我们无法用言语来表达我们所得到的鲜明印象。”声明指出，他们看到了民主德国的学生们得到广泛的照顾，在西德情况就恰恰相反，有许多青年失业，青年没有机会学习，因为阿登纳政府不想帮助青年，而只想把青年变成军人，并利用青年达到军事目的。声明表示，他们将把德意志民主共和国生活的真实情况告诉西德青年。
