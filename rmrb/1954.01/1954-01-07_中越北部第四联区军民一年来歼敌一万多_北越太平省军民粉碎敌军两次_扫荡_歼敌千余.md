    Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Vietnam News Agency, 5th: The military and civilians in the Sino-Vietnamese Northern Fourth Inter-Zone, in close coordination with other fronts, have heavily struck the invading troops over the past year. In 1953, they eliminated a total of more than 11,100 enemy troops, including six major officers, twenty-five captains and lieutenants, and many sergeants; destroyed twelve enemy locomotives, one hundred ammunition-laden horse-drawn carts, and sixty-two motorcycles.
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th. According to Vietnam News Agency: A communique issued on the 4th stated that the military and civilians of Thai Binh Province on the left bank of the Red River in North Vietnam thwarted two large-scale enemy "sweep" operations in December 1953, eliminating 1,736 enemy troops.
    The communique said: The French colonialists gathered nearly all of their mobile forces stationed in the Red River Delta and launched two large-scale "sweep" operations in mid- and late December 1953 against the guerrilla bases in southern Thai Binh Province and the northern areas of Thai Binh Province, but both were met with heroic resistance from the military and civilians of Thai Binh Province.
    In three small villages in Tien Hai County, the local troops of the People's Army and guerrillas successfully repelled thirty-seven consecutive enemy attacks, killing 124 enemy troops. In a small village in Kien Xuong County, the guerrillas launched a tenacious two-day resistance against two enemy mobile battalions, eventually forcing the enemy to retreat. At the same time, more than 160 enemy troops fell into traps set by the guerrillas in advance during the "sweep," and forty-six motorcycles were destroyed by landmines. Local troops of the People's Army and guerrillas also constantly intercepted enemy troops in various parts of Thai Binh Province, achieving victories.
    The communique said: In the fifteen days of fighting up to December 27, the military and civilians of Thai Binh Province thwarted two large-scale enemy "sweep" operations, eliminating a total of 1,736 enemy troops, most of whom were European and African soldiers. Together with the battles conducted in coordination with other provinces in the left bank area of the Red River Delta during the same period, the People's Army killed 2,147 enemy troops and wounded 650; captured 30 mortars and rocket launchers, 100 machine guns, and more than 500 various weapons; and destroyed 91 motorcycles.
    Another message said: On the evening of December 31, the Vietnamese People's Army launched a surprise attack on a unit of the enemy's Eighth Mobile Regiment stationed in Cao Bi Village, Kien Xuong County, Thai Binh Province. After an hour of fighting, the People's Army killed more than two enemy companies, most of whom were European soldiers; captured 39 enemy troops; and seized about 50 various weapons.
