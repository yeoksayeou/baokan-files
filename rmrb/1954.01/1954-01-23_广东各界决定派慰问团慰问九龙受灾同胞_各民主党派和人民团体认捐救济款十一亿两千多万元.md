Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 21st: Representatives from 30 units, including the Guangdong and Guangzhou municipal local organizations of various democratic parties and the Guangdong and Guangzhou municipal people's organizations, held a symposium on the afternoon of the 17th to discuss the issue of providing relief to compatriots affected by the fire in the Shek Kip Mei wooden house area of Kowloon, Hong Kong. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution to organize a慰问团 to visit the disaster area to offer condolences, and pledged a total of 1.1223 billion RMB in relief funds on the spot to aid the affected compatriots.

The representatives present unanimously expressed their boundless concern for the compatriots affected by the disaster, and expressed great dissatisfaction with the attitude and measures taken by the British Hong Kong government, which should bear full responsibility for the occurrence of this fire and the subsequent aftermath.

Chen Rutang, Chairman of the South China Provisional Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: The people of the motherland are always thinking of the Hong Kong compatriots. The unity and friendship of our people cannot be blocked by geographical or other artificial factors. This time, the great fire in the Shek Kip Mei wooden house area of Kowloon, Hong Kong, caused serious disasters to more than 60,000 compatriots. The Guangdong and Guangzhou branches of the Red Cross Society of China have already allocated grain and funds for relief. We should continue to donate funds to help the affected compatriots.

Zhang Wen, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Branch of the China Democratic League, pointed out in his speech: The British Hong Kong government must, both morally and legally, effectively fulfill its responsibility to protect the lives and property of our residents. The British Hong Kong government has absolutely no reason to shirk or evade responsibility for the post-disaster relief work for the residents affected by this fire, and must not take advantage of the situation to persecute them in any way.

Huang Changshui, Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association, suggested that in addition to donating funds for further relief, the Guangdong and Guangzhou municipal people's organizations should organize a慰问团 to visit the disaster area to comfort the affected compatriots. He also pointed out that the British Hong Kong government must quickly and effectively carry out disaster relief work, urgently distribute relief funds, and effectively solve the urgent food and housing needs of the affected residents.

Chen Qiu'an, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: After each disaster suffered by our compatriots in Hong Kong, they always receive relief from the people of the motherland in the most difficult times. After this fire, people from all walks of life in Hong Kong launched relief efforts, which shows that our compatriots living in Hong Kong care about each other. I hope they will unite closely, help each other, and urge the British Hong Kong government to effectively take responsibility for relief and aftermath.

Qiu Zhe, Instructor of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party in Guangdong and Guangxi, expressed his extreme indignation at the irresponsible attitude and inhumane behavior of the British Hong Kong government in failing to provide assistance in times of danger after this great fire, as in the past.

Zheng Tianbao, Director of the South China General Branch of the China Zhi Gong Party, and representatives from various people's organizations, Liao Silan, Chen Guoquan, Huang Rongzeng, Li Langru, Fang Wenyu, and Chen Danian, also spoke at the meeting, expressing their boundless concern for the compatriots who unfortunately suffered from the fire. They believed that the British Hong Kong government should bear full responsibility for the series of bizarre fires that have occurred in the wooden house areas of Kowloon and should provide proper relief and resettlement for the affected compatriots.

    广东各界决定派慰问团慰问九龙受灾同胞
    各民主党派和人民团体认捐救济款十一亿两千多万元
    【新华社广州二十一日电】各民主党派广东省、广州市地方组织和广东省、广州市各人民团体共三十个单位的代表，在十七日下午举行座谈会，讨论救济香港九龙深水埗木屋区受火灾同胞的问题。会上一致通过了组织慰问团前往灾区进行慰问的决议，并当场认捐救济款共人民币十一亿二千三百多万元，以救济受灾同胞。
    到会代表一致表示对受灾同胞无限关怀，并对应对这次火灾的发生和善后工作负完全责任的香港英国政府所采取的态度和措施，表示极大的不满。
    中国国民党革命委员会华南临时工作委员会主任委员陈汝棠说：祖国人民时刻都怀念着香港同胞，我们人民的团结与情谊不是地域以及其他人为的因素所能阻隔的。这次香港九龙深水埗木屋区大火，六万多同胞遭受了严重的灾难，中国人民救济总会广东省、广州市分会已拨了粮款进行救济，我们应继续捐款来援助受灾的同胞。
    中国民主同盟广东省支部委员会主任委员张文在发言时指出：香港英国政府无论在道义上和法理上都必须切实负起保障我国居民生命财产安全的责任。对这次大火中受灾居民的善后救济工作，香港英国政府绝对没有任何推卸和逃避的理由，更不能乘人之危加以任何的迫害。
    中国民主建国会广州市分会主任委员黄长水建议除捐款作进一步救济外，由广东省、广州市各界人民组织慰问团前往灾区慰问受灾同胞。他同时指出：香港英国政府必须迅速切实进行救灾工作，紧急发放赈款，以有效办法解决受灾居民所迫切需要的食住问题。
    中国民主促进会广州市分会副主任理事陈秋安说：香港我国同胞在每次遭受灾难后，总是在最困难的时候首先得到祖国人民的救济。这次火灾发生之后，香港各界同胞都展开了救济工作，这就说明了居住在香港的我国同胞是相互关心的。希望他们紧密地团结在一起，互相帮助，并督促香港英国政府切实负起救济和善后的责任。
    中国农工民主党两广指导员丘哲在发言中对香港英国政府在这次大火灾发生之后仍采取和过去一样不负责任的态度，见危不救的极不人道的行为，表示万分愤慨。
    中国致公党华南总支部主任委员郑天保及各人民团体代表廖嗣兰、陈国泉、黄榕增、李朗如、方文瑜、陈大年等都在会上讲了话，对这次不幸遭受火灾的同胞表示无限关怀，并认为香港英国政府应对九龙木屋区历次发生离奇的大火灾负完全责任，对此次受灾同胞应予妥善的救济和安置。
