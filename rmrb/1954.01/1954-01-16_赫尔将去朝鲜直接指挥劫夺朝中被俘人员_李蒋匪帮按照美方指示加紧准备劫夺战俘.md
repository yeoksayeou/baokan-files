Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 14th: Commander of the U.S. Far East Command, Hull, will go to Korea to personally command and supervise his subordinates in seizing North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war held under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on January 23rd. Hull announced this plan to reporters on the 13th after returning to Tokyo from Taiwan by plane. Hull also announced to reporters that he had reached an "agreement" with the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Taiwan to seize 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war from Korea and take them to Taiwan. He also said that the Chiang Kai-shek gang "has a representative in Tokyo to work out the details." He also admitted that these prisoners of war who were forcibly kidnapped "will probably get a chance" to join the Chiang Kai-shek army.

At the same time, preparations for seizing prisoners of war in Korea are being intensified. According to the Associated Press, Syngman Rhee convened a military conference on the 13th with senior military leaders of the Li gang and division commanders, and will hold another meeting on the 15th. Officials of the Li gang said that the purpose of Syngman Rhee's convening this meeting was to "formulate plans" to make "military preparations" for the conspiracy to seize prisoners of war on January 23rd. According to the Associated Press, the Li gang police authorities announced on the 12th that 320 Li gang secret police "will enter the Munsan area." The task of these secret police is to escort North Korean People's Army prisoners of war to the Li gang's "recruitment stations" in Pohang and Gunsan, in order to force them into the Li gang army as cannon fodder. According to United Press, the advance personnel of the one hundred special agents dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek gang to South Korea to "receive" volunteer army prisoners of war according to the U.S. plan, led by a special agent chief of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, the "Director of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense," arrived in South Korea on the 12th and began specific arrangements with the U.S. side for seizing prisoners of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 15th: Our correspondent reports: The situation at the Tongjang-ni POW camp is tense, and the U.S. side is stepping up preparations for armed seizure of prisoners of war around the POW camp.

As observed by our reporter from a height north of the military demarcation line in recent days, U.S. and South Korean puppet troops are frequently maneuvering on Height 115 on the southern edge of the demilitarized zone. Intense shooting and explosions are often heard on the mountain, and smoke from exploding rocks constantly billows from behind the mountain. U.S. aircraft circle over Height 115 every day. At 8:00 p.m. on the 13th, two batches of U.S. aircraft invaded the airspace over the POW camp in the demilitarized zone, the first batch with three aircraft and the second batch with about a dozen aircraft, circling for several minutes before flying away. Every night, U.S. tanks frequently appear on both sides of Height 115. At 8:00 p.m. on the 12th, two U.S. tanks used lights to illuminate the POW camp for more than 20 minutes, and the U.S. civil police near the POW camp also cooperated in firing flares into the sky above the POW camp. In each camp in Tongjang-ni, the special agents lit bonfires or torches, echoing each other from afar.

In the demilitarized zone near the POW camp, the U.S. and South Korean military police, posing as U.S. civil police, have also been increasing in number. Since the 6th, armed U.S. personnel have been found patrolling along the POW camp and the military demarcation line. In order to prevent the prisoners of war from taking the opportunity to escape to the north on January 22nd, the U.S. and South Korean troops have placed many landmines south of the military demarcation line, and these patrols are patrolling back and forth all day in the area where yellow safety signs are placed. At 2:00 a.m. on the 12th, a U.S. personnel crawled into the demilitarized zone controlled by our side for 30 meters to conduct reconnaissance and was immediately discovered by our civil police. At this time, a flashlight suddenly shone from the military demarcation line, attempting to guide the person who crossed the border to escape south.

According to captured U.S. and South Korean special agents who recently infiltrated our area, the U.S. and South Korean troops have recently repaired the road surrounding the Tongjang-ni POW camp and have begun to repair the road to Munsan day and night on the southern edge of the demilitarized zone. From the telescope, it can be observed that more than 40 trucks loaded with U.S. and South Korean troops arrive at the road construction site every day to work. At 8:30 p.m. on the 13th, 53 trucks loaded with U.S. and South Korean troops drove from the right side of Height 115 to the vicinity of the POW camp to repair the road. According to U.S. and South Korean special agents who were recently captured infiltrating our area, the U.S. and South Korean troops are rushing to repair the road from Tongjang-ni to Changdan, and barbed wire has been erected on both sides of the road from Changdan to Munsan.

Our captured personnel who returned on the 12th said that the U.S. special agents' control of the prisoners of war in Tongjang-ni has recently reached its peak. In addition to being forced to practice crossing the camp and marching with backpacks every morning, the prisoners of war are tightly imprisoned in tents. From the telescope, the reporter saw that in each camp, prisoners of war were not seen coming out all day except during exercise and meal times, only those "security guards" holding large wooden sticks ran back and forth in front of the barbed wire.

    赫尔将去朝鲜直接指挥劫夺朝中被俘人员
    李蒋匪帮按照美方指示加紧准备劫夺战俘
    【新华社开城十四日电】远东美军总司令赫尔将要到朝鲜去，亲自指挥和监督他的部下在一月二十三日劫走中立国遣返委员会看管下的朝中被俘人员。赫尔在十三日从台湾乘飞机回到东京后对记者宣布了这个计划。赫尔还对记者宣布：他在台湾时已经与蒋匪帮取得把一万四千名中国人民志愿军被俘人员从朝鲜劫往台湾的“协议”。他又说：蒋匪帮“有一个代表在东京制订细节”。他还承认：这些被武力绑架的战俘“大概会得到一个机会”参加蒋匪军。
    同时，在朝鲜劫夺战俘的准备工作正在加紧进行。据美联社报道：李承晚在十三日召集李匪高级军事领袖和各师师长举行了一次军事会议，并且在十五日还将举行一次会议。李匪帮的官员说：李承晚召开这次会议的目的，是“拟订计划”为一月二十三日劫夺战俘的阴谋作好“军事上准备”。据美联社报道，李匪警察当局十二日宣布：三百二十名李匪特务警察“将进入汶山地区”。这些特务警察的任务是把朝鲜人民军被俘人员押送到浦项和群山的李匪“入伍站”去，以便强迫把他们编入李匪军充当炮灰。据合众社报道，蒋匪帮按照美方的计划派遣到南朝鲜去“接收”志愿军战俘的一百名特务的先遣人员，已在十二日由蒋匪的一个特务头子“国防部第二厅厅长”率领到达南朝鲜，开始与美方进行劫夺战俘的具体安排。
    【新华社开城十五日电】本社记者报道：东场里战俘营的形势已是箭在弦上，美方正在战俘营周围加紧进行武装劫持战俘的准备。
    据记者在军事分界线以北某高地上连日观察所见，非军事区南缘一一五高地上的美军和李伪军正在频繁地调动，山上经常传来激烈的射击声和爆炸声，山后不断喷出爆炸岩石的硝烟。美机每天都在一一五高地上空盘旋。十三日晚八时，有两批美机先后侵入非军事区的战俘营的上空，第一批三架，第二批约十余架，盘旋数分钟后飞去。每天晚上，美方坦克经常在一一五高地两侧出现。十二日晚八时，有两辆美方坦克用灯向战俘营照射二十多分钟，战俘营附近的美方民政警察，并配合着向战俘营上空放射信号弹。东场里各个营场内的特务，有的燃起篝火，有的点起火把，遥遥呼应。
    在战俘营附近的非军事区内，冒充美方民政警察的美、李军宪兵也日渐增多。自六日以来，发现有荷枪的美方人员沿战俘营与军事分界线之间巡逻。美、李军为了防止一月二十二日战俘们乘机逃往北方，在军事分界线以南埋置了许多地雷，这些巡逻队就整日在安置有黄色安全标志的地带来往巡逻。十二日晨二时，曾有一名美方人员匍匐潜入我方控制的非军事区三十公尺进行侦察，当即被我方民政警察发现，这时军事分界线上忽然射出手电筒的光，企图引导这一越界侦察的人向南逃去。
    据观察，美、李军在最近几日已经把围绕东场里战俘营的公路修好，并开始在非军事区南缘日夜赶修通往汶山的公路。从望远镜中可以观察到，每天有四十多辆满载美、李军的卡车，到达筑路地段工作。十三日晚八时半，有五十三辆卡车载着美、李军从一一五高地右侧开到战俘营附近去修路。据最近捕获的潜入我方地区的美、李特务供称：美、李军正在赶修东场里至长湍的公路，长湍至汶山的公路两旁已拉好了铁丝网。
    十二日归来的我方被俘人员说，美方特务最近对东场里战俘的控制已发展到了顶点，战俘除每天上午被强迫背着背包操练越营和行军外，都被严密地囚禁在帐篷中。记者从望远镜里看到，在各个营场中，战俘每天除在操练、吃饭的时间外，整天不见出来，只有那些拿着大木棒的“警备队员”在铁丝网前跑来跑去。
