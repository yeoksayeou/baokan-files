Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 20th: When the news came that the Indian Custodial Forces had unilaterally handed over Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to the U.S. side, our returning personnel in Kaesong expressed great anger at the U.S. side's serious crime of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, and also expressed dissatisfaction with the Indian Custodial Forces for abandoning the sacred responsibility entrusted to it by its "Terms of Reference."

　　The returned fifty-six-year-old fisherman, Zhang Shuliang, has a younger brother in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp. After hearing the news, he burst into tears and said, "Because the Americans sabotaged the explanation work, my brother never had the opportunity to hear the explanations and apply for repatriation. Now, they are going to send him into the fire pit again. My brother and I have been torn apart by U.S. imperialism like this.”

　　Returning personnel Zhang Shiying said: In March of last year, he and more than 100 other prisoners of war were brutally beaten for being discovered by special agents wanting to return to their country. Now, except for him, the rest of his fellow sufferers have not had the opportunity to apply for repatriation. He told reporters: "Many prisoners of war wanted to return to their country, but they were controlled by U.S. special agents in various ways and could not return. Now, the Indian Custodial Forces are sending them back into the tiger's mouth again."

　　Li Xiaoxian, a returned person who was repeatedly tortured by special agents in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp for wanting to be repatriated, said: "The 'Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission' was originally intended to rescue prisoners of war from the clutches of the Americans. Now, the Indian Custodial Forces have handed over our captured personnel to the Americans, allowing them to continue to suffer endless torment. This is really too wrong!"

    我方归来人员谴责印军把战俘交给美方
    【新华社开城二十日电】当印度看管部队片面把朝中被俘人员交还给美方的消息传来时，在开城的我方归来人员都对美方强迫扣留战俘的严重罪行表示极大的愤怒，并且对印度看管部队放弃“职权范围”所赋予它的神圣责任表示不满。
    归来的五十六岁的老渔民张书良还有一个弟弟在东场里战俘营里。他听到这个消息后，就痛哭失声说：“因为美国人破坏解释工作，我的弟弟始终没有得到听取解释和申请遣返的机会。现在，他们又要把他送到火坑里去了。我们兄弟两人就这样被美帝国主义拆散了。”
    归来人员张世英说：在去年三月，他和另外一百多名战俘都因为被特务发觉想要回国而遭到毒打。现在，除了他以外，其余的难友们都没有得到机会申请遣返。他对记者说：“许多战俘是希望回国的，只是被美方特务用各种办法控制着而未能回来。现在，印度看管部队却又把他们送回虎口里去了。”
    在美方战俘营中曾多次因为想要遣返而被特务拷打的归来人员李孝先说：“‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’本来是为的要把战俘从美国人的魔掌中拯救出来。现在印度看管部队却又把我方被俘人员交还给美国人，让他们继续去受无穷无尽的折磨，这实在太不应该了！”
