All Farmers in Jinggangshan Area, Jiangxi Province, Write to Chairman Mao Zedong to Congratulate Him on the New Year

Respected Chairman Mao:

The New Year of 1954 has arrived, and all of us farmers in the Jinggangshan area extend our warmest congratulations to you.

Chairman Mao, now you live in the distant city of Beijing. We cannot see you on Jinggangshan as often as we did during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, but we still think of you all the time.

Chairman Mao, the Jinggangshan area has changed greatly. In the four years since liberation, we farmers on the mountain have truly turned ourselves over politically, economically, and culturally.

Politically, all of us farmers are now truly masters of our own affairs. Our farmers have become representatives of the township and county… some women have become township heads. Every township has Party organizations and various organizations of mass groups. We farmers have truly turned ourselves over politically.

Economically, each person has been allocated an average of one and a half mu of paddy fields and more than twelve taels of timber, which has given us a foundation. In addition, in response to your call to organize and develop production, we have organized three year-round mutual aid teams and fifty-three seasonal mutual aid teams. Now, not only has the phenomenon of barren and uncultivated fields in the past been changed, but we have also had bumper harvests year after year, and the yield has increased year by year. Thanks to the government's help and support, more than 570 new houses have been built in the whole area, and we will no longer have to endure the days of being exposed to wind and rain day and night.

In terms of cultural learning, there is one county-run primary school, four township-run primary schools, and seventeen people-run winter schools in the whole area. More than 70 percent of the farmers have participated in cultural learning. For example, Lan Yaqing, a farmer in the Dajing electoral district who was illiterate, can now recognize more than 2,600 characters.

Recently, we have studied the general line for the transition period of the country, and everyone is determined to take the bright road of socialist common prosperity. We actively responded to the call to sell surplus grain to the state and sent more than 250,000 jin of surplus grain sold to the state into the state warehouse within three days. We are also determined to do a good job in preparing for winter cultivation, winter planting, and spring plowing production, further consolidate and improve the existing mutual aid groups, and guide individual farmers to organize as well.

Chairman Mao, finally we assure you: we must "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," and advance by leaps and bounds towards a happy socialist society in accordance with the general line you proposed.

We wish you good health!

### 江西省井冈山区全体农民写信  向毛泽东主席祝贺新年

    江西省井冈山区全体农民写信
    向毛泽东主席祝贺新年
    敬爱的毛主席：
    一九五四年元旦到来了，我们井冈山区的全体农民向您致最热烈的祝贺。
    毛主席，现在您住在遥远的北京城，我们不能像第二次国内革命战争时期一样，随时在井冈山上见到您，可是我们还是无时无刻不在想念着您。
    毛主席，现在井冈山区大大变样了。解放四年来，我们山上的农民确实在政治上经济上文化上大大地翻了身。
    在政治上，现在我们全体农民都真正当家作主了。我们农民当了乡代表、县代表……有的妇女当了乡长。每个乡里都有党的组织和群众团体的各种组织。我们农民在政治上真正翻身了。
    在经济上，每人平均分到水田一亩半、木码十二两以上，这样我们的家底子就有了。再加上响应了您提出的组织起来发展生产的号召，组织了三个常年互助组、五十三个季节性互助组，现在不仅改变了过去田地荒芜无人耕种的现象，而且年年丰收，产量一年比一年提高。由于政府的帮助和扶植，现在全区添建了新屋五百七十多间，白天黑夜挨着风吹雨打的日子再也不会有了。
    在文化学习方面，全区有县立小学一所，乡立小学四所，民校冬学十七所。百分之七十以上的农民都参加了文化学习。像大井选区不识字的农民蓝亚庆现在已经认识了两千六百多字。
    最近我们学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，大家都决心走社会主义大家富裕的光明道路。我们积极响应把余粮卖给国家的号召，并且在三天内把二十五万多斤卖给国家的余粮送入了国家仓库。我们还决心要做好冬耕冬种和春耕生产的准备，进一步巩固和提高原有的互助组，引导单干农民也组织起来。
    毛主席，最后我们向您保证：一定要“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，按照您提出的总路线，为过渡到幸福的社会主义社会大踏步前进。
    祝您身体健康！
                    井冈山区全体农民上
