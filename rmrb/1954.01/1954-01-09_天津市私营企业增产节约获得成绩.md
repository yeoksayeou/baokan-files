    Tianjin Private Enterprises
    Achieve Success in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    Under the leadership of the local Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee, the increase production and practice economy movement in Tianjin's private enterprises has achieved remarkable results. According to preliminary calculations from 242 factories and factories in the woodworking and papermaking industries, the fourth quarter of last year is estimated to have increased production and saved over 150 billion yuan. Most factories have overfulfilled their increase production and practice economy plans. Nine industries, including dyeing and finishing, cigarette manufacturing, and papermaking, promptly convened professional meetings to balance supply, production, and sales, enabling the increase production and practice economy movement to steadily and deeply develop on the track of the national economic plan.
    In the increase production and practice economy movement, the local Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee more deeply mobilized the masses of workers, improved production, and established various systems. According to incomplete statistics from eight districts, over 200 rationalization proposals, inventions and creations, and technological and machinery improvements proposed by employees were adopted. Many factories established and improved various production responsibility systems and improved labor organization and mass production meeting systems. For example, in the second district of the city, 32 factories had established these systems by October. The active production of workers and the establishment of various systems have enabled many factories to achieve remarkable results in increasing output, saving raw materials, and especially improving quality. For example, the dyeing and finishing industry's 24 factories had a maximum output of 750,000 bolts per quarter in the past; in the fourth quarter of last year, due to the promotion of new operating methods, they could complete 1 million bolts. In terms of improving quality, the percentage of qualified products used to be 50 to 60 percent, but in October, it increased to an average of 91.59 percent. In October, Shoufeng Flour Mill increased the flour yield while ensuring quality, producing two more jin of flour per hundred jin of wheat, increasing flour production by 210,000 jin. In terms of saving raw materials, the cigarette industry can save 28 jin of tobacco leaves per case of cigarettes at most, generally 19 jin, and at least 7 jin. According to preliminary estimates, a total of over 554,900 jin of tobacco leaves can be saved throughout the year.

    天津市私营企业
    增产节约获得成绩
    天津市私营企业的增产节约运动，在当地增产节约委员会领导之下，已获得显著成就。根据二百四十二户工厂和木器、造纸两行业工厂的初步计算，去年第四季度可增产节约一千五百亿元以上。大部分工厂都超额完成了增产节约计划。染整、纸烟、造纸等九个行业，都及时地召开了平衡供产销的专业会议，使增产节约运动能在国家经济计划的轨道上，稳步地深入发展。
    在增产节约运动中，当地增产节约委员会比较深入地发动了职工群众，改进了生产，并建立了各种制度。据八个区不完全的统计，职工提出的合理化建议、发明创造以及技术与机器改进等，被采纳的即达二百多件。许多工厂建立和健全了各种生产责任制度，改进了劳动组织与群众生产会议制度。如该市第二区在十月份即有三十二个工厂建立了这些制度。职工积极生产和各种制度的建立，使许多工厂在提高产量、节约原料、尤其是提高质量上，获得了显著成绩。如染整业二十四个工厂，过去最高产量一个季度为七十五万匹，去年第四季度，由于推广了新操作法，就可完成一百万匹的任务；在提高质量上，过去正品率百分之五○至六○，十月份平均提高到百分之九一·五九。寿丰面粉厂十月份在保证质量下提高了出粉率，每百斤麦子多出二斤面粉，增产面粉二十一万斤。在节约原料方面：纸烟业最高的每箱纸烟能节约烟叶二十八斤，一般能节约十九斤，最低的也能节约七斤，据初步估计，全年可节约烟叶五十五万四千九百余斤。
