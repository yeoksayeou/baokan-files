Happiness Pond

Our Correspondent Lin Mo

Winter in Sichuan is full of vitality. The mountains and forests are lush green, the wheat seedlings are already half a foot high, and the fat and tender pea and broad bean seedlings are also growing vigorously. Butterflies are flying above them. Compared with the north, it feels like spring here.

The propaganda of the general line of the state during the transition period has set off a surge of mutual aid and cooperation and water conservancy construction in many rural areas of Sichuan. Last December 19th was an extraordinary day for the farmers of Yichi Village in Suining County. Their "Happiness Pond" held a groundbreaking ceremony on that day. After being educated on the general line, the farmers of Yichi Village clearly understood that they should take the socialist road, and the entire village worked together to build a large reservoir for the benefit of future generations. Because this pond is the beginning of the entire village's farmers advancing towards a happy socialist life through collective labor, people gave it the name "Happiness Pond."

Half a month before the reservoir started construction, the whole village became busy: more than 20 mutual aid groups went to the fields before dawn and did not return until dark; every household was rushing to plow the fields, process the land, and sow the early spring crops. Work that used to take a month to complete will now be completed in ten days, because once the "Happiness Pond" starts construction, all the labor force in the village will go to dig the pond, and there will be no time to do these jobs anymore. The elderly and women who cannot go to the fields are busy preparing tools for building the pond, cutting bamboo, weaving bamboo baskets for carrying mud, and tying springboards with wood and straw. Village Representative Director Wu Yaochen and several cadres plan the project and organize the labor force, and they are so busy that they can't even eat. No one in the village has experience in such a large project, and every step must be repeatedly discussed and considered, for fear of making mistakes.

On the morning of the groundbreaking day, every family ate breakfast as soon as it dawned, and each residential group and mutual aid group shouted and gathered people. As soon as the sun came out, the crowd set off along the paths between the fields towards the construction site. The sky was floating with purple clouds, and a layer of thin mist was floating at the foot of the mountain. The morning sun shone through the mist on the rice fields filled with winter water, and the water surface shone with a layer of golden light like fish scales. The mutual aid group's team, carrying red flags, walked past the fields with great excitement, startling the fish in the water. The fish also seemed particularly active, jumping out of the water from time to time to please people.

The first to arrive at the construction site was the Youth League member Jiang Qingyun's mutual aid group. Jiang Qingyun's excited face was flushed today, a bit like he was drunk. He greeted, and the young women Zhu Wanqing and several group members responded by taking off their shoes, rolling up their trouser legs, and following him into the construction site. The place where the reservoir was being dug was originally a rice field. The water was drained, and the mud in the field was more than a foot deep. They didn't pay attention to this, and stepped into the cold mud with their legs and began digging nervously, with a proud and happy expression on everyone's face. Representative Director Wu Yaochen also arrived later, and when he saw them from a distance, he shouted loudly, asking them not to dig randomly, but to wait for everyone to come and start together. Jiang Qingyun and his group members said with a smile:

"Look, the first load of mud from this 'Happiness Pond' was carried up by us!"

All the groups arrived, and some elderly people also came to watch the excitement with crutches. Cadres from the Special Office and the CPC Suining Prefectural Committee also arrived. Everyone gathered to hold a groundbreaking ceremony for the "Happiness Pond." Zhu Qingyun, representing the water users, thanked everyone. He said excitedly and hoarsely: "This pond, the 26 households in our bend will benefit from the water. Now all 300 households in the village are here to help. If it weren't for the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, could this pond be built!" The water users were as excited as Zhu Qingyun today. With this pond built, their fields in this bend will not only no longer have to worry about drought, but some of the highland fields can also grow two crops a year; the ditch fields can freely release and irrigate water, implement splash irrigation, and also produce more grain. In their eyes, this pond is simply a large granary. After it is built, they can take grain from it every year. In the past, they never dreamed that so many people would come to their land to build such a large reservoir! Youth League member Jiang Qingyun, representing the helpers, said what everyone was thinking: "This time everyone studied the general line, and their vision is broader and farther. Everyone looks at the whole village and at socialism, and things are easier to handle. This year you help me, next year I help you. According to the village's plan, within five years, all thirteen old reservoirs in the village will be enlarged and deepened one by one. With these large reservoirs, whether we want to establish agricultural production cooperatives or run collective farms, these will become everyone's public property." Jiang Qingyun seemed particularly active today. After speaking, he led everyone in shouting slogans: "Everyone works for socialism, unite to build the Happiness Reservoir!" The shouts spread along the valley. Then, teams of people walked to their own work areas and began digging the soil of the "Happiness Pond" one hoe at a time.

Representative Director Wu Yaochen looked at the black mass of busy people, and felt much more relaxed. He felt that he had finally managed to get things started. He thought of how in the past, when organizing two or three mutual aid groups to build a small reservoir, it was always a matter of you suffering a loss and me taking advantage, with endless disputes; if this household agreed, that household would not. This time, with all 300 households in the village working together, things were proceeding so smoothly and quickly.

"Look at everyone's enthusiasm, if it weren't for publicizing the general line, you wouldn't be able to invite these people even if you kowtowed to every household!" Wu Yaochen said to mutual aid group leader Wu Changqing.

"Yes, who would have thought of this a month ago!" Wu Changqing said. This time, he was Wu Yaochen's most capable assistant in building the pond, and Wu Yaochen consulted him on everything first.

A month ago, let alone mobilizing the entire village to build a pond through mutual aid, even several long-term mutual aid groups had stopped working, not to mention some seasonal mutual aid groups. Many farmers abandoned their work in the fields and ran around to do business. At that time, standing on the side of the road to Ximei Town in the morning, you would see peddlers of cloth, rice, ginger, duck herders, egg collectors, etc. These small peasant traders came out of the mountain gullies one after another. Along the way, they always discussed with each other how to make more money, where things were cheap, and where it was most suitable to sell them. At that time, it was really impossible for them to listen to talk about mutual aid and cooperation and water conservancy construction. Take Wu Changqing for example, the mutual aid group he led was one of the best in the village, with increased production every year and surplus grain for every household. As soon as life improved, some people felt that they could live their lives without mutual aid, and some people left the mutual aid group to do business. Seeing others making money doing business, Wu Changqing himself was also tempted. He said: "At that time, his thoughts were really like a pair of feet walking, wanting to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, doing a good job in the village's work and the entire group's production; at the same time, wanting to abandon these and go it alone." Last autumn, he really put down the mutual aid group and followed others to do business. Wu Changqing's business was in full swing when he suddenly received a notice asking him to attend the district representative meeting to study the general line. In the district, he listened to the reports on the general line by the district party secretary and the district head, and he felt full of regret for his leaving the mutual aid group to do business. Later, he listened to some village cadres' typical speeches检讨自己走错路的典型发言, these speeches struck his heart like drums again and again. Lying down at night, he asked himself painfully: In the past, your family suffered oppression and torment from the landlord, and you hated the landlord class to death. Now that you have finally turned over, you are going to do business and exploit others. Do you also want to take the old road of the landlord bourgeoisie? Wu Changqing and Wu Yaochen returned from studying in the district, and both made up their minds to do a good job in the village. When the matter of repairing the reservoir was brought up, they were the most enthusiastic. The farmers in the village, because of the publicity of the general line, many people also saw clearly that the capitalist road of personal enrichment was not feasible. Some farmers who were doing business returned to the mutual aid group to engage in production, and on the hillside, they saw the red flag of the mutual aid group fluttering again. After the decision to repair the pond, the township heard that the area of this pond was more than four mu, and it needed to be dug one zhang and eight chi deep, requiring more than 5,000 workdays. They were afraid that Yichi Village could not afford it, so they mobilized farmers from other villages to borrow labor to support them. However, the farmers of Yichi Village did not need support. Driven by the mutual aid group, everyone volunteered and divided up more than 3,000 cubic meters of earthwork at once. They said: Workers build factories, and we farmers build land; the project is large, and our collective strength is even greater. Everyone hardens their shoulders, and heavy burdens become lighter.

Wu Yaochen and Wu Changqing walked around the perimeter of the pond, and saw that each group was working hard and orderly according to the plan. They also took off their shoes, picked up their tools, and disappeared into the working crowd.

    幸福塘
    本报记者　林沫
    冬天的四川，田野里充满了生气，山林是葱绿的，麦苗已有半尺高，肥嫩的豌豆和蚕豆秧也都长得很茂盛，蝴蝶在上边飞舞着，比起北方，这儿像是春天了。
    国家在过渡时期的总路线的宣传，在四川许多农村掀起了互助合作和兴修水利的热潮，去年十二月十九日，对遂宁县和赤乡一村的农民来说，这是一个不平常的日子，他们的“幸福塘”就在这天举行开工典礼。一村的农民受到总路线的教育后，明确了要走社会主义的道路，全村农民互助变工修一个大堰塘，为子孙万代谋福利。因为这口塘是全村农民用集体劳动向幸福的社会主义生活前进的开始，人们就给它起了个名儿叫“幸福塘”。
    距堰塘动工还有半个月，全村就忙起来了：二十多个互助组天不亮就下田，一直干到天黑才收工；家家都在赶着犁田，进行土地加工，播种小春作物。往年拖延一个月才干完的活，现在要十天赶完，因为“幸福塘”一开工，全村劳动力都要去挖塘，就再没时间干这些活了。不能下田的老年人和妇女，忙着准备修塘用的工具，砍竹子，编制担泥土用的竹簸箕，用木料和稻草缚绑跳板。村代表主任吴耀臣和几个干部计划工程，组织劳动力，更是忙的连饭都吃不上，这么大的工程，村里谁也没经验，步步都要反复商量考虑，只怕出差错。
    开工那天早上，天一亮各家就吃了早饭，各居民组和互助组就喊叫着集合人。太阳刚出来，人群就沿着田间小道向工地进发了。天空浮泛着紫色的云霞，山脚下飘荡着一层薄雾，早晨的阳光透过薄雾照射着储满冬水的稻田，水面上闪耀着一层鱼鳞似的金光，互助组的队伍打着红旗，兴冲冲地从田边走过，惊动了水里的鱼儿，鱼儿也显得特别活跃，不时跳出水面讨人们的欢喜。
    最先来到工地的是青年团员蒋庆云的互助组，蒋庆云今天兴奋的脸上泛着红光，有点像喝醉了酒，他招呼了一声，女青年朱万青和几个组员就应声脱下鞋子，卷起裤腿，跟着他走进了工地。挖堰塘的地方，原是一块稻田，水放了，田里的稀泥有
  一尺多深，他们没注意这些，双腿踏进冰冷的稀泥里就紧张的挖掘起来，人人脸上充满着自豪、幸福的神情。代表主任吴耀臣也随后赶来了，远远的看见他们，就大声喊叫起来，要他们不要乱挖，等大家来了一齐动手。蒋庆云和他的组员们却嘻笑地说：
  “看哪，这‘幸福塘’的头一担泥土，是我们挑上来的！”
    各组都到齐了，一些老年人也拄着拐杖赶来看热闹，专署和中共遂宁地委的干部也到了，大家集合起来，为“幸福塘”举行开工典礼。朱清云代表用水户感谢大家，他激动地、声音沙哑地说：“这口塘，用水得利的是我们这弯里的二十六户人，如今全村三百来户人都来帮助。眼前站着齐楚楚的一大片，不是毛主席、共产党的领导，这塘能修得起吗！”用水户今天都像朱清云一样的激动，这口塘修好了，他们这一弯里的田地，不但再也不用担心旱灾，一部分塝田还可以种两季庄稼；沟田可以自由地放水、浇水，实行溅水灌溉，也能多打粮食。在他们眼里，这口塘简直是一个大粮仓，修好以后，每年从里边取粮食就是了。过去他们做梦也没想到，会有这么多人在自己地边上来修这么大个堰塘呵！青年团员蒋庆云代表帮工户说出了众人的心意：“这回大家学习了总路线，眼光都看得宽、看得远了。大伙都望到全村，望到社会主义，事情就好办了。今年你帮我，明年我帮你，依照全村的计划，五年之内，全村的十三口老堰塘一个个都要加大、挖深，有了这些大堰塘，我们要成立农业生产合作社也好，办集体农庄也好，这都成了大家的公共财产了。”蒋庆云今天显得特别活跃，讲完话，他又领着大家呼口号：“搞社会主义大家干，团结来修幸福堰！”这呼声顺着山谷传开去。接着，人们一队一队走向自己的工区，开始一锄一锄地挖掘“幸福塘”的泥土。
    代表主任吴耀臣望着黑鸦鸦一片忙碌的人群，身上轻松了许多，他觉得总算忙出一个头绪来了。他想到往年组织两三个互助组在一起修个小堰塘时，总是你吃亏了，我占便宜了，互相争扯不休；说转这一户，那一户又不干了。这次全村三百来户一起干，事情进行得却是这样顺利和迅速。
    “看大家这股热火劲，不是宣传总路线，你挨家磕头也请不到这些人呵！”吴耀臣向互助组组长吴长清说。
      “是呵，早一个月，谁会想到这件事！”吴长清说。这次修塘他是吴耀臣最得力的助手，什么事吴耀臣都先找他商量。
    一个月以前，别说发动全村人互助修塘，就连几个常年互助组都歇了工，一些季节性的互助组更不用说了。很多农民丢下地里活不干，东跑西转去作生意。那时候，早上站在去西眉镇的路边上，你会看到贩布的、贩米的、卖姜的、赶鸭子的、收鸡蛋的等等，这些农民小商贩一个接一个从山沟里走出来，他们一路上总是互相谈论着怎样多赚钱，那里什么东西便宜，弄到什么地方卖最合适。那时候，要向他们谈互助合作、兴修水利，他们心眼里实在听不进去。就拿吴长清说吧，他领导的互助组是全村最好的一个，年年增产，家家有余粮。生活刚一好转，有些人就觉得：不闹互助，自己的日子也能过了，有些人便离互助组去作生意。吴长清见别人做生意赚钱，自己也动了心，他说：“那时他的思想真像走路的一双脚，一时想走互助合作的路，把村里的工作、全组的生产都搞好；一时又想丢开这些，自己单干。”去年秋后，他果真放下互助组，跟上别人去做生意。吴长清生意搞得正热，忽然接到通知，要他参加区代表会进行总路线的学习。到区上，他听了区委书记和区长关于总路线的报告，对自己放下互助组去做生意的事就满心后悔，后来又听了一些村干部检讨自己走错路的典型发言，这些发言一次一次像打鼓一样敲击着他的心，夜里睡下来，他沉痛地问自己：过去你一家人受地主的压迫和折磨，你恨地主阶级恨死了，如今才翻了身，却去做生意剥削别人，难道你也想走地主资产阶级的老路吗？吴长清和吴耀臣从区上学习回来，两人都下了决心，要把村里的工作搞好，修堰塘的事一提出来，他俩的劲头最大了。村里的农民，因为经过总路线的宣传，许多人也都看清了，个人发财的资本主义道路走不得。一些做生意的农民又回到互助组里搞生产，山坡上，又看到互助组的红旗在飘扬了。修塘的事决定之后，乡上听说这口塘的面积有四亩多大，要挖一丈八尺深，需用五千多工，怕一村搞不起，又去动员别村的农民借工支援，但一村的农民不需要支援，在互助组的带动下，大家自报奋勇，一下就把三千多个土方分完了。他们说：工人建设工厂，我们农民建设土地；工程大，我们集体的力量更大，大家硬一硬肩膀，重担子也变轻了。
    吴耀臣和吴长清沿着塘地四周走了一圈，见每一组都在按照计划紧张而有秩序地进行工作，他们两个也脱下鞋子，拿上工具，隐没在工作的人群里了。
