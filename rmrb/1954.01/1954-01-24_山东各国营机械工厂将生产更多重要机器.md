Shandong's machinery manufacturing factories and locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing factories, under the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government, will further expand and improve production this year. The planned total production value for the entire year is 19.92% higher than the actual production value of last year (excluding Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory). Among them, Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory plans the highest increase, with a planned increase of 52.96%.

The factories plan to produce more than 50 major products this year. Among them, there are 22 types of machine tools and power machinery, including various lathes, gantry planers, diesel engines, 1200 kg diesel pile drivers, and 140-horsepower Lancashire boilers. There are more than 30 types of electrical machinery, including various automotive generators, various induction motors, gear reduction motors, various dry batteries, and storage batteries for railways, automobiles, telecommunications, and mines. In addition, there are locomotives (some parts, such as axles and steel plates, still need to be imported), passenger cars, and freight cars for railway transportation.

To meet the needs of national construction, the factories also plan to trial-produce many new products this year. Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory will trial-produce Soviet-style 1616 lathes, Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory will trial-produce 7231A gantry planers, Weifang Diesel Engine Factory will trial-produce 600 kg diesel pile drivers, Jinan Diesel Engine Factory will trial-produce 90-horsepower medium-speed diesel engines, and Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory will trial-produce wide-gauge locomotives and dining cars. The 60-horsepower high-speed diesel engine, which was basically trial-produced by Weifang Diesel Engine Factory at the end of last December, will continue to be trial-produced this year, and will be put into small-scale production after experience is gained.

Most of the machines produced by the factories this year have high precision and efficiency, and are important equipment necessary for industrial construction. For example, various lathes and gantry planers are machine equipment for manufacturing plants of machines, tractors, automobiles, and motors. Diesel engines can be used for power generation, mining exploration, pile driving, and power equipment for ships and tractors. Various motors have a wider range of uses and can be used to drive the operation of various machines, and are indispensable electrical equipment for the construction of modern heavy industry, light industry, and transportation. The locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars manufactured by Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory occupy an important position in transportation.

In view of the fact that the crash production in the fourth quarter of 1952 completely used up work in progress, which affected the smooth progress of production in the first quarter of last year, the factories generally carried out preparations for the first quarter of this year in December last year. Since the start of work this year, the factories have successively broken quotas and increased production.

    山东各国营机械工厂将生产更多重要机器
    中央人民政府第一机械工业部所属山东各机械制造工厂和机车车辆制造工厂，今年生产将进一步扩大与提高。今年全年生产总值计划比去年实际生产总值提高百分之十九点九二（青岛四方机车车辆制造工厂除外）。其中以济南第二机床厂计划增长的数字为最高，该厂计划提高百分之五十二点九六。
    各厂今年计划生产的主要产品有五十多种。其中属于工作母机和动力机械类的有各种车床、龙门刨床、柴油机以及一千二百公斤柴油打桩机和一百四十马力兰开夏式的锅炉等二十二种。其中属于电机电器类的有各种汽车发电机、各种感应电动机、齿轮减速电动机、各种干电池和铁道、汽车、电信、矿山用的蓄电池等三十多种。此外还有铁路运输用的机车（个别部件如车轴、钢板等还需国外输入）、客车、货车等。
    为适应国家建设的需要，今年各厂还计划试制许多新的产品。济南第一机床厂将试制苏式的1616型车床，济南第二机床厂将试制7231A型的龙门刨床，潍坊柴油机厂将试制六百公斤柴油打桩机，济南柴油机厂将试制九十马力中速柴油机，青岛四方机车车辆制造厂将试制宽轨机车和餐车。潍坊柴油机厂去年十二月底基本试制成功的六十马力高速柴油机今年也将继续试制两台，待取得经验后再进入小批生产。
    各厂今年生产的机器，大部分的精密度很高，效率很大，是工业建设所必需的重要装备。如各种车床、龙门刨床等是机器、拖拉机、汽车、电机等制造厂的机器设备，柴油机可以用于发电、矿山钻探、打桩、轮船和拖拉机的动力设备等。各种电动机的用途更广，可用于带动各种机器的运转，是建设现代重工业、轻工业和交通运输业不可缺少的电器设备。青岛四方机车车辆制造工厂制造的机车、客车、货车在运输上占重要的地位。
    各厂鉴于一九五二年第四季突击生产将在制品完全用尽，以致影响去年第一季度生产顺利进行，因而在去年十二月份一般都进行了今年第一季度生产的准备工作。今年开工以来，各厂纷纷突破了定额，提高了生产。
