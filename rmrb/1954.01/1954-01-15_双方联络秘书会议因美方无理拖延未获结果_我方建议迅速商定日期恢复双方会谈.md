Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 14th: The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the political conference issue issued the following communique:

    On January 14, 1954, the liaison secretary of our delegation to the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, upon our suggestion, held a meeting with the liaison secretary of the other side at Panmunjom to agree on a date for the resumption of bilateral talks. Due to delays by the US side, today's meeting yielded no results.

    Our secretary stated at today's meeting: The governments of Korea and China have consistently strived to promote the swift convening of a political conference in order to satisfy the eager expectations of peace-loving people and countries around the world for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and thereby ease tensions in the Far East and the world. However, the current bilateral talks on the political conference issue have fallen into a prolonged interruption, resulting in the indefinite postponement of the political conference, thereby seriously jeopardizing the ardent hopes of peace-loving people and countries around the world. The Korean and Chinese sides believe that the bilateral talks should not have been interrupted at all, and a prolonged interruption is even more unacceptable. In order to promptly arrange the convening of the political conference, our side proposes to immediately resume the bilateral talks, and formally suggests January 16, 1954, as the date for the resumption of bilateral talks.

    The US secretary avoided discussing the resumption date proposed by our side, instead proposing the modification of certain parts of the records of past meetings of the bilateral talks as a condition for resumption, and suggested that the liaison secretaries of both sides hold an administrative meeting to handle the work of modifying past meeting records and to discuss the resumption date.

    Our side immediately pointed out that the bilateral talks should not have been interrupted at all, therefore there should be no conditions for resumption, and the records of past meetings are irrelevant to resumption. The only issue now is for both sides to agree on a resumption date, which is extremely easy to resolve and there is no need to hold an administrative meeting to handle it. Our side again requested the other side to express its attitude towards the date proposed by our side. However, the other side repeatedly evaded answering the question of the meeting date proposed by our side, insisting on its proposal to hold an administrative meeting and suggesting an adjournment until tomorrow.

    Finally, our side solemnly stated that, in order to promote the early convening of the political conference, our side suggests the swift resumption of bilateral talks and has formally suggested January 16th as the resumption date, which is fully in line with the urgent desires of peace-loving people around the world. Because the other side refused to discuss the resumption date suggested by our side, the issue of agreeing on a resumption date could not be resolved at today's meeting. Adhering to our consistent stance of promoting the early convening of the political conference, our side is willing to make another effort and agrees to adjourn until tomorrow to continue discussing the issue of resuming bilateral talks, while emphasizing that there should be no conditions for resumption. If the other side truly has the sincerity to resume bilateral talks, there is no reason to repeat today's attitude at tomorrow's meeting, and should quickly agree with our side on the resumption date so that the highly anticipated bilateral talks can be resumed as soon as possible.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong: Special correspondent Wu Min reports: If the US side continues to refuse to discuss the date issue tomorrow, it will prove that Washington is unwilling to promptly resume the interrupted bilateral talks for arranging the political conference.

    The US side refused to set the 16th as the date for resuming the bilateral talks on the political conference issue at today's liaison secretaries' meeting in Panmunjom. The US liaison secretary ignored the suggestions repeatedly made by the Korean and Chinese sides to discuss the date and set January 16th as the date for resuming the bilateral talks.

    The immediate resumption of bilateral talks has been obstructed by the US liaison secretary's insistence on his own views. The US liaison secretary stubbornly demanded: (1) That previous discussion records must be "appropriately corrected" before a date is set, and (2) that this issue must be discussed in an administrative meeting so that the public cannot see the truth of the delay in resuming bilateral talks.

    The Korean and Chinese side's position of advocating the swift resumption of bilateral talks was expressed extremely clearly at today's liaison secretaries' meeting. Bilateral talks should be resumed immediately without any conditions. The previous discussion records have nothing to do with the issue of resuming bilateral talks held for the early convening of the political conference expected by the whole world. Discussing the date issue does not require holding an administrative meeting.

    The US liaison secretary refused to answer today what relationship there was between "correcting the records" and resuming bilateral talks. He suggested an adjournment and reopening tomorrow morning. The Korean and Chinese liaison secretary said that in order to resume bilateral talks as soon as possible, the Korean and Chinese side is "willing to make another effort" and agreed to adjourn the meeting until tomorrow to "discuss the date of resuming bilateral talks" again. He told the US liaison secretary that if the US side is sincere in resuming bilateral talks, he should not continue to refuse to set a date for resuming bilateral talks.

    双方联络秘书会议因美方无理拖延未获结果
    我方建议迅速商定日期恢复双方会谈
    【新华社开城十四日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    一九五四年一月十四日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的我方代表团的联络秘书，根据我方建议与对方联络秘书在板门店举行会议，以商定恢复双方会谈的日期。由于美方的拖延，今日会议并无结果。
    我方秘书在今日会上表示：朝中两国政府一贯努力于推动政治会议的迅速召开，以满足全世界爱好和平的人民和国家对于和平解决朝鲜问题并从而缓和远东和世界紧张局势的殷切期望。但是目前关于政治会议问题的双方会谈却陷于长期的中断，以致政治会议的召开被无限期地延搁，因而严重地危害了全世界爱好和平的人民和国家的这一殷切期望。朝中方面认为双方会谈根本就不应该中断，长期中断更是不应该。为了迅速安排政治会议的召开，我方主张立即恢复双方会谈，并正式建议一九五四年一月十六日为双方会谈的复会日期。
    美方秘书对我方所提出的复会日期避不讨论，却提出修改双方会谈过去会议记录的某些部分作为复会的条件，并建议双方联络秘书会议进行行政性会议，以处理修改过去会议记录的工作，并讨论复会日期。
    我方当即指出：双方会谈根本就不应该中断，因此复会也不应该有任何条件，过去的会议记录更与复会无关。现在的问题只有一个，就是双方商定一个复会的日期，这问题极易解决，没有必要举行行政性会议来加以处理。我方再次要求对方对我方所提日期表示态度。但对方对我方所提会议日期问题一再避不作答，仍坚持其举行行政性会议的主张并建议休会至明天。
    最后我方郑重表示，我方为了促成政治会议早日召开，建议迅速恢复双方会谈，并已正式建议一月十六日为复会日期，这是完全符合全世界爱好和平的人民的迫切愿望的。由于对方拒绝讨论我方所建议的复会日期，以致商定复会日期的问题未能在今天的会上获得解决。我方本着促成政治会议早日召开的一贯立场，愿再作一次努力，同意休会到明天继续讨论恢复双方会谈的日期问题，同时强调指出：复会不应有任何条件，如果对方确有恢复双方会谈的诚意，就没有任何理由在明天的会上重复今天的态度，而应迅速与我方商定复会的日期，使举世期待的双方会谈得以早日恢复。
     【新华社开城讯】本社特派记者吴敏报道：如果美方明天继续拒绝讨论日期问题，那就证明华盛顿方面不愿迅速恢复中断了的安排政治会议的双方会谈。
    美方今天在板门店联络秘书会议上拒绝确定以十六日作为恢复关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的日期。美方联络秘书对于朝中方面一再提出的关于讨论日期以及确定一月十六日为恢复双方会谈的日期的建议置之不理。
    双方会谈的立即恢复，已经由于美方联络秘书的固执己见而遭到阻挠。美方联络秘书固执地要求：（一）在确定日期之前必须对以前的讨论记录予以“适当的改正”，（二）这个问题必须在行政性会议上讨论，以便使公众看不到拖延恢复双方会谈的真相。
    朝中方面主张迅速恢复双方会谈的立场，今天在联络秘书会议上表示得明确极了。双方会谈应当毫无任何条件地立即恢复。以前的讨论记录，跟恢复为了早日召开全世界所期待的政治会议而举行的双方会谈问题是毫无关系的。讨论日期问题是用不着举行行政性会议的。
    美方联络秘书今天拒绝答复“改正记录”与恢复双方会谈之间究竟有什么关系，他建议休会，明天上午再开。朝中方面联络秘书说，为了早日恢复双方会谈，朝中方面“愿再作一次努力”，同意会议休会到明天，再“讨论恢复双方会谈的日期”。他对美方联络秘书说，如果美方有诚意恢复双方会谈，他就不应该继续拒绝确定恢复双方会谈的日期。
