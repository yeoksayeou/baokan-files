    Northeast Completes Rural Survey for 1953

    The Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Committees of the various provinces in the Northeast region have completed the rural survey work for 1953. As early as the beginning of October last year, the Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau organized fifty-four people to go to Songjiang, Jilin, and Liaodong provinces, each selecting three villages for survey work. Subsequently, the provinces also began investigations one after another. As of mid-December last year, relatively in-depth and comprehensive rural survey work had been conducted in sixteen counties and forty-two villages throughout the region. Then, the Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau spent a week concentrating on the materials obtained from the surveys in various places and discussing them. At the same time, the Liaoxi, Liaodong, and other provincial committees had instructed the county committees of two or three counties to independently select key villages for investigation.

    The content of this survey was: 1. The development of the rural economy and class changes; 2. The development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement; 3. The leadership issues of districts and villages. It can be seen from the survey materials from various places that there is new development in the rural economy of the Northeast, especially in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Among the forty-two villages surveyed, agricultural production cooperatives have emerged in about half of the villages. The most is in Minli Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, which has already established four agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for 50.2 percent of the organized households in the village. In Nongfeng Village, Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, all farmers have been organized. One agricultural production cooperative includes 7.9 percent of the households, and eleven year-round groups include 76.3 percent of the households. According to the survey of Jiefang, Sanhe, and Guangming villages in Yushu County, Jilin Province, in 1952, year-round groups accounted for 14.4 percent of the organized households; in 1953, two agricultural production cooperatives were established, and the number of member households and year-round mutual aid group households together accounted for 31 percent of the organized households. These three villages represent three typical villages with faster, moderate, and slower development of work. Supply and marketing cooperatives have also greatly developed. Take the above-mentioned three villages in Jilin as an example: in 1953, the means of production and living materials supplied by the supply and marketing cooperatives exceeded 1.1 times that of 1951; the sales of agricultural and sideline products also increased by 66 percent. The materials supplied and sold by the supply and marketing cooperative in Nongfeng Village accounted for 90 percent of the total purchase and sales of farmers. Many areas have established credit cooperatives or credit departments established by supply and marketing cooperatives, which have enlivened the rural economy. According to statistics from Qinshan Village, Xi'an County, Liaodong Province, the number of farmers who have relations with the credit cooperative has increased from 13.6 percent of the total farmers in 1950 to 44.6 percent in 1953. Due to the development of mutual aid groups and cooperatives, agricultural technology has been improved, and the level of agricultural production has gradually increased. According to statistics from nine villages surveyed by the Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau: in 1953, the average yield per hectare was 2,867 catties, which was 17.7 percent lower than in 1952 (the highest yield in history), but still exceeded the highest average yield during the puppet Manchukuo period by 10 percent. Last year, Rehe Province piloted 409 agricultural production cooperatives, and only 17 cooperatives had a lower yield than the average yield of the whole village; the reason was that 13 cooperatives suffered from floods and 4 cooperatives were not well managed. Facts have proved that 96 percent of the cooperatives were successful. According to materials from Liaodong and Jilin provinces, the purchasing power of farmers has increased by an average of about 30 percent compared with last year.

    However, with the development of the rural economy, the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the small-peasant economy are also growing. The spontaneous tendency of the small-peasant economy is growing in a hidden form. Some put on the guise of mutual aid groups to exploit poor households, and some secretly sabotage or corrode the mutual aid and cooperation movement. This makes the struggle between the two roads more intense. However, in villages that resolutely implement the Party's policies and where the mutual aid and cooperation movement is developing normally, socialist ideology occupies the dominant position, and capitalist factors also wither and weaken accordingly. These materials powerfully prove the importance of carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture.

    This rural survey has greatly promoted practical work. For example, the issue of organically combining the work of publicizing the general line of the state during the transition period with the work of grain purchase, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and winter production has become clearer after seeing the survey materials. But the more important gain is that it has relatively clearly ascertained the "bottom line" of the rural economy and rural work in the past year, and found ways to further solve problems and improve work in several important aspects. Therefore, the leading organs are more confident when deploying work in 1954; it is also of great help for cadres to study the general line of the state during the transition period. The core study group of the Northeast Bureau conducted a special discussion on this, further clarifying the importance of transforming the small-peasant economy to the cadres.

    The steps and methods of this survey were: 1. Relatively full preparations were made in advance. First, manpower was organized, training was conducted, and important documents on agricultural production and rural work were studied so that each member participating in the survey was familiar with the policies and had a clear mind. Then, the survey outline and precautions were studied and researched; it was also necessary to be familiar with the survey forms and learn the necessary statistical knowledge. Then, the survey objects were selected. Each province selected three different types of typical villages with advanced, intermediate, and relatively slow progress, and tried to collect and read historical materials related to these villages as much as possible. 2. After arriving in the village, a general survey was generally conducted first to grasp the basic situation and discover representative figures. Then, the work was divided according to the questions, and the formal survey began. The best survey method is to hold various types of survey meetings, with a survey group of three to five people being the most suitable. At the same time, key individual visits must be made. In order to ensure the authenticity of the survey materials, each survey group relied on the village's Party and Youth League branches to verify and review the materials; and Party members, Youth League members, and village cadres were absorbed to participate in the survey, so that it was easy to be quick and accurate. 3. Ideological education work was generally paid attention to during the survey. From the beginning, the purpose of the survey was explained to the farmers; the publicity and education work of the general line was carried out at any time and place according to the specific local conditions during the survey. And attention was paid to combining it with the current central work. When the survey began, it was the time when the movement to increase production and practice economy was being widely carried out, so the farmers were publicized to increase production and practice economy during the survey, thereby promoting this work. The survey team in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, also helped solve specific problems such as the settlement of accounts for mutual aid groups and the distribution of agricultural production cooperatives, which the farmers were very satisfied with. 4. Report in time during the survey, sort out the materials in time, study the materials, and write the materials in the village. Before returning to the province, report to the district committee and county committee again, and then study, analyze, and verify the materials. This is also very important. 5. The personnel participating in the survey consistently implemented the spirit of learning from beginning to end, and the materials themselves were vivid textbooks; no wonder every member who participated in the survey said: "I have received a profound education on the general line."

    东北完成一九五三年度农村调查
    中共中央东北局和东北区各省省委的农村工作部已完成了一九五三年度的农村调查工作。早在去年十月上旬，东北局农村工作部即组织五十四人分赴松江、吉林、辽东三省，各选三个村进行调查工作。此后，各省亦陆续开始调查。截至去年十二月中旬，全区已经在十六个县、四十二个村中进行了比较深入的全面的农村调查工作。然后，东北局农村工作部用一周时间，集中各地调查所得的材料，并加以讨论。与此同时，辽西、辽东等省省委都曾指示二、三县的县委，自行选择重点村调查。
    此次调查内容是：一、农村经济的发展和阶级变化；二、互助合作运动的发展；三、区、村的领导问题。从各地调查材料中可以看出东北农村经济，特别是互助合作运动的新发展。在调查的四十二个村中，约有半数的村子出现了农业生产合作社。最多的是黑龙江省克山县民力村，已经建立了四个农业生产合作社，占该村组织起来户数的百分之五十点二。松江省双城县农丰村的农户，已经全部组织起来。其中一个农业生产合作社包括的户数占农户百分之七点九，十一个常年组包括的农户占户数的百分之七十六点三。另据吉林省榆树县解放、三合、光明三个村的调查，一九五二年常年组占组织起来户数百分之十四点四；一九五三年建立了两个农业生产合作社，社员户数和常年互助组户数加在一起，就占了组织起来户数百分之三十一。这三个村是代表了工作开展较快、中间、比较缓慢的三种典型村。供销合作也有了很大的发展。还拿上述吉林三个村为例：一九五三年供销合作社供应的生产资料和生活资料超过一九五一年一点一倍；推销的农副业产品也增加了百分之六十六。农丰村的供销社供销的物资，占农民购买和销售总数百分之九十。不少地区建立了信贷合作社，或由供销社设立了信贷部，活跃了农村经济。据辽东省西安县亲善村的统计：和信贷合作社发生关系的农户，已由一九五○年占总农户百分之十三点六，增加到一九五三年的百分之四十四点六。由于互助组、合作社的发展，改良了农业技术，农业生产的水平逐步提高了。据东北局农村工作部所调查的九个村的统计：一九五三年平均每垧产量为二千八百六十七斤，虽低于一九五二年（历史上的最高产量）百分之十七点七，但仍超过伪满时期的最高平均产量百分之十。热河省去年试办了四百零九个农业生产合作社，只有十七个社的产量低于全村平均产量；原因是有十三个社遭受水灾，四个社没有办好。事实证明：百分之九十六的社都是成功的。根据辽东、吉林两省的材料，农民的购买力平均比去年提高百分之三十左右。
    但随着农村经济的发展，小农经济的资本主义自发趋势也在滋长。小农经济的自发趋势是在隐蔽的形式下滋长的。有的披上互助组的外衣剥削贫困户，有的暗中破坏或腐蚀互助合作运动。这样就使得两条道路的斗争更加激烈化。但，凡是坚决执行党的政策，互助合作运动发展正常的村子，社会主义思想就占了优势，资本主义因素亦随之萎靡和削弱。这些材料有力地证明了对农业实行社会主义改造的重要意义。
    这次农村调查，对实际工作起了很大的推动作用。如关于宣传国家过渡时期的总路线的工作和购粮工作、互助合作运动、冬季生产等工作有机结合的问题，在看到调查材料后越发明确了。但更重要的收获是：比较清楚地摸清了一年来农村经济和农村工作的“底”，在若干重要方面都找到了进一步解决问题和提高工作的方法。因此，领导机关在部署一九五四年工作时，更加心中有数；对干部学习国家过渡时期的总路线，也有很大帮助。东北局核心学习组曾就此进行了专门讨论，进一步使干部明确认识了改造小农经济的重要性。
    此次调查所以能收到这样大的成绩，主要是东北局和各省省委领导机关都十分重视这一工作。东北局主要负责同志不仅亲自审查了调查提纲，并提出调查中应注意的问题。辽西省省委书记杨易辰同志亲自到义县指导调查工作，并屡次听取汇报，使得调查工作能顺利进行。吉林省委不仅派出省委办公室、组织部、宣传部、农村工作部、省团委等部门的主要骨干参加调查；调查结束后，又以两天时间听取了调查汇报，并进行了若干问题的分析和研究。
    此次农村调查的步骤和方法是：一、事先作了比较充分的准备，先组织人力，进行训练，学习了有关农业生产、农村工作方面的重要文献，使得每一个参加调查的成员熟悉政策，头脑清醒。然后学习和研究调查提纲和注意事项；还要熟悉调查表格，学会必要的统计知识。再是选择调查对象，各省都是选择工作先进的、中间的、进步比较迟缓的三种不同的典型村子，并尽可能搜罗和阅读了有关这些村子的历史材料。二、到了村里，一般地都先进行概括性的调查，掌握基本情况，并发现有代表性的人物。再按问题进行分工，正式开始调查。最好的调查方法是召开各种不同类型的调查会，调查组以三、五人为最合适。同时必须作重点的个别访问。为保证调查材料的真实，各调查组都依靠村的党、团支部对证和审查材料；并吸收党员、团员、村干部参加调查，这样容易作到迅速、准确。三、调查中一般都注意了思想教育工作，一来就跟农民说明调查的目的；调查中随时随地都根据当地具体情况，同时进行总路线的宣传教育工作。并注意了和当前中心工作相结合。开始进行调查时，正是普遍开展增产节约运动的时候，因此在调查中向农民宣传增产节约，因而推动了这一工作。黑龙江省克山县的调查组，还帮助解决了互助组的清工结账、农业生产合作社的分配等具体问题，农民非常满意。四、调查时及时汇报，及时整理材料，研究材料，并在本村写好材料。在回省以前又向区委、县委汇报，再加以研究、分析和证实材料。这也是很重要的。五、参加调查的人员自始至终贯彻了学习精神，材料本身就是生动的课本；难怪每个参加调查的成员都说：“受了一次深刻的总路线的教育。”
