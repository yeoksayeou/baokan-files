Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th—Today, during the forced transfer of prisoners of war to the US side, dozens of Korean and Chinese captured personnel risked their lives to break free from the clutches of special agents and demanded repatriation. Thirty-six Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel and one Korean People's Army captured personnel were sent back to Panmunjom at 7 p.m.

These POWs who escaped at the last moment of the US forced detention of POWs said: In the camps, special agents had divided the POWs into groups of twenty-five on the afternoon of the 19th, forcing them to monitor each other and forbidding them from escaping. This morning, the special agents used this method to drive the POWs out of the camps. The "battalion commanders," "company commanders," "platoon leaders," and "guards" of each camp held wooden sticks, broadswords, or gasoline-filled cans, threatening the POWs, saying, "Whoever wants to go home will be caught and beaten to death on the spot." Many returnees were caught by special agents during their escape. They put up a desperate resistance before escaping the clutches of the special agents. Returnees Li Guanghui and Wang Hongxin were hit hard on the head by special agents chasing from behind with wooden sticks, so that their faces were still very pale upon arriving in Panmunjom.

The returnees said: Today, after they were forcibly dragged out of the POW camp by special agents, they saw more than a hundred fully armed American military police standing on the road outside the camp, watching their movements with fierce eyes. Special agents had threatened the POWs several days earlier, saying, "American soldiers will come to 'protect' you when you leave the camp. Everyone can only go south and is not allowed to go north. If anyone disobeys orders, the American soldiers will shoot!" Early this morning, they also saw American helicopters landing two to three hundred meters away from the camp in the demilitarized zone. They installed loudspeakers and ordered Taiwanese special agents to broadcast threatening messages to the POWs.

The returnees also said: On the night of the 19th, the special agents did not allow the POWs to sleep, forcing each of them to copy a "declaration of freedom." The draft of this "declaration" was written by "Teacher Shi," a Taiwanese special agent posing as a POW. POWs who could not write were forced to ask others to copy it for them. Half a month ago, special agents had also forced each POW to write an "application" to go to Taiwan. The POWs who returned today brought with them these so-called "declarations of freedom" and "applications" that they were forced to write by these special agents.

The returnees said: Among the POWs who were forcibly dragged away by special agents today were some who had been tortured for expressing their desire for repatriation. On January 2nd, six POWs from Camp No. 17 attempted to climb over the barbed wire fence to request repatriation. After being discovered by special agents, they were detained in a secret cellar in the camp and tortured, resulting in serious injuries. One of them had his ribs broken. These helpless victims were also dragged away by special agents today. The returnees also said: The special agents openly said that when boarding the ship in Incheon, they would throw those who had expressed thoughts of returning home into the sea.

Returnee Zhang Songnian repeatedly told neutral nations personnel at Panmunjom that the Korean and Chinese POWs all wanted to return home, but they were deprived of the opportunity to listen to explanations and apply for repatriation by the US special agents.

    三十七名朝中被俘人员冲出特务魔掌遣返归来
    他们愤怒控诉美方劫夺朝中战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城二十日电】今天在战俘被强迫移交给美方的过程中，有数十名朝中被俘人员冒死冲出特务魔掌要求遣返。其中三十六名中国人民志愿军被俘人员和一名朝鲜人民军被俘人员在下午七时被送回到板门店。
    这些在美方强迫扣留战俘的最后一刻逃出来的战俘说：各个营场里的特务在十九日下午，就把战俘分编为二十五人一组，强迫他们互相监视，不准逃跑。今天上午，特务就用这种办法将战俘赶出营场。各营场的“大队长”、“中队长”、“小队长”和“警备队员”都拿着木棒、大刀或装着汽油的罐头盒，恫吓战俘说：“谁想回家，当场抓住就打死。”许多归来人员在逃跑途中曾被特务抓住，他们进行了拚死的抵抗，才逃脱特务的魔掌。归来人员李光辉和王鸿信，曾被后面追来的特务用木棒猛击头部，以致在到达板门店时，脸色还十分苍白。
    归来人员说：今天，他们在被特务架出战俘营以后，看见在看管营地外面的公路上站着一百多个全副武装的美国宪兵，虎视眈眈地监视着他们的行动。特务早在几天以前就恫吓战俘说：“将来出了营场就有美国兵来‘保护’，大家只能向南走，不准向北走，谁不服从命令，美国兵就要开枪的！”今天一早，他们还看见美国的直升飞机落在非军事区内看管营场附近的二、三百公尺处，他们安上了扩音机，命令台湾特务对战俘进行威胁性的广播。
    归来人员还说：在十九日晚上，特务不准战俘们睡觉，强迫他们每人抄一张“自由宣言”。这份“宣言”的底稿是由冒充战俘的台湾特务“史老师”草拟的，不会写字的战俘也要请别人代抄一份。在半个月以前，特务还曾强迫每个战俘写了一份要求到台湾去的“申请书”。今天归来的战俘都带来了这些特务分子强迫他们写的所谓“自由宣言”和“申请书”。
    归来人员说：今天被特务分子强迫架走的战俘中，有些是因流露出遣返愿望而受过酷刑的人。一月二日，第十七号营场的六个战俘企图翻铁丝网要求遣返被特务发觉后，就被押在营场里的秘密地窖内拷打成重伤，其中一人的肋骨已被打断。这些不能动弹的受难者今天也被特务分子架走。归来人员还说：特务公开说，在仁川上轮船的时候，就把那些曾经流露出回国思想的人，都丢在大海中。
    归来人员张松年在板门店一再地向中立国人员说，朝中战俘都是希望回国的，但是被美方特务剥夺了听取解释和申请遣返的机会。
