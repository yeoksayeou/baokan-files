    To Carry Out Propaganda Work on the Worker-Peasant Alliance During the Spring Festival
    The Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government issued a notice to its subordinate cultural centers (stations) in mid-January, requiring them to carry out propaganda activities on the general line during the Spring Festival and to conduct propaganda and education on the worker-peasant alliance among workers and peasants.
    The notice put forward specific methods for the activities of cultural centers (stations):
    First, mobilize amateur worker-peasant troupes to universally perform short plays and ballads about the worker-peasant alliance; without affecting production, cities may appropriately organize worker amateur troupes, suburban rural troupes and other cultural and recreational organizations to hold get-togethers, or perform mutual consolation performances. In rural areas, small get-togethers can be appropriately organized by rural troupes when workers return to their hometowns during the Spring Festival, based on specific conditions and circumstances. Where conditions permit, peasants can also be organized to visit factories.
    Second, contact trade unions and other units to hold worker-peasant get-togethers, invite responsible comrades from local Party and government organs to give reports, or organize representatives of workers and peasants to report on their production situation, learn from each other, and encourage each other.
    Third, organize picture exhibitions related to the general line in factories and rural areas; organize cultural and artistic organizations in towns or rural areas with the conditions to publish picture magazines and wall newspapers related to propaganda on the worker-peasant alliance.
    Fourth, areas with wired broadcasting equipment can rebroadcast propaganda programs about the worker-peasant alliance from the People's Broadcasting Station or specially organize propaganda programs about the worker-peasant alliance; or hold broadcasting conferences to organize workers and peasants to listen.
    Fifth, use slide projectors, local broadcasts, blackboard newspapers, etc., to carry out propaganda on the worker-peasant alliance.
    Sixth, all localities can appropriately organize worker-peasant labor models, as well as factories and agricultural production cooperatives, to write letters of condolences to each other and encourage each other.
    The notice also stipulates that each cultural center (station) should, under the leadership of the local Party committee, contact relevant units and formulate a practical propaganda plan based on the specific conditions of each locality.
