	Gao Guizhen in Korea
	Ruo Shui
	In deep autumn October, the mountains and fields of Korea were covered with red maple leaves. Amidst applause and cheers, the cars of the Second Detachment of the Sixth General Sub-group of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea arrived at a certain unit of the Volunteer Army on the Kim Il-sung front.
	The most noticeable delegate in the delegation was Gao Guizhen. Her steadfast love and her bravery warmed the hearts of every soldier. When the soldiers thought of Gao Guizhen, they thought of their homes, their loved ones, or the girls they dreamed of. Back in China, Gao Guizhen received over a thousand letters. The vast majority of these letters were sent from the Volunteer Army. Some sent her Korean butterflies, some sent her maple leaves from the battlefield, and some sent her photos of their meritorious service.
	How the soldiers yearned to see Gao Guizhen in person! Wherever she went, the soldiers swarmed around her, vying to shake her hand and ask for her autograph. After listening to Gao Guizhen's report, many soldiers wrote letters to pay their respects to her. Model worker Yang Jinlin sent her a handkerchief, saying in his letter: "I haven't been able to sleep for several nights, always wanting to express my feelings with a small gift... This is the handkerchief I received when I attended the model worker conference, although it's not a great thing, it's my most cherished. Dear Comrade Guizhen, please accept it!" Soldier Yang Guan'gen was deeply moved by Gao Guizhen's exemplary deeds and wrote to his fiancée, hoping that she would also be a Gao Guizhen-like fiancée.
	Coming here, Gao Guizhen felt as if she had come home, and seeing the soldiers, she felt as if she had seen her own brothers. Like chatting with relatives, she talked to the soldiers about the construction of the motherland, this year's harvest, how their village transformed from "Poor Henan Village" into "Rich Henan Village," and how the girls in their village wanted to be fiancées of Volunteer Army soldiers. When she was happy, she often burst into hearty laughter.
	Once, when the conversation was lively, a soldier requested: "Sister Gao, please sing us a song!"
	Gao Guizhen looked up and thought for a moment, and said, "I'll sing you a popular folk song from our village!" After saying that, she began to sing:
	...The hero wears a glorious flower,
	He wears the red flower to visit his in-laws.
	He is a hero, I am a model,
	We two are truly a golden melon paired with a silver melon,
	A golden melon paired with a silver melon!
	Everyone who listened smiled knowingly. Although the hero didn't have the opportunity to visit his in-laws, the model worker had traveled thousands of miles to meet the hero.
	A few days after Gao Guizhen arrived in Korea, the leaders of the unit sent a car to pick up her husband, Dong Shigui. On October 13th, the day Dong Shigui was expected to arrive, Gao Guizhen seemed particularly happy. She washed her hair, looked in the mirror several times, and smiled all day long. At dusk, she was outside untying the clothesline when she heard a group of people shouting in the house:
	"Gao Guizhen, come quickly! He's here!"
	Gao Guizhen said, "Who's here? You're talking nonsense!" As she spoke, she ran towards the house. As soon as she entered the door, Dong Shigui stood up.
	"Hello, Shigui!" Gao Guizhen said, generously extending her hand.
	"Hello, Guizhen!" Dong Shigui also said, his face flushed.
	They had been separated for six years and barely recognized each other. He saw that she had changed, from a little girl to a grown woman; she saw that he had also changed, from a young lad to a burly soldier. Six years ago, they separated in hardship: she suffered at home all day; he, to avoid being drafted, crouched motionless in a woodpile for six or seven days, and was finally forced to leave. Now, they met in happiness: she was a nationally renowned model worker; he was also a glorious Volunteer Army hero. What tremendous changes had taken place in these six years!
	They clearly knew how this happiness came about. She personally pinned a sickle and hammer badge and a Chairman Mao badge on his chest, so that he would always remember the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
	Late at night, they talked in the room. She told him about the situation at home and in the village in recent years; he told her about life in the army and his meritorious deeds. They exchanged photos, inscribed each other's commemorative albums, and made competition plans. …
	On December 2nd, at the suggestion of the leaders of the delegation and the leaders of the unit, they got married. Although it was on the battlefield, the wedding was grand and warm. The leaders and representatives of the delegation, the leaders and cadres of the unit all attended this unusual wedding and congratulated them.
	The next day, the delegation returned to China, leaving Gao Guizhen behind, asking her to stay for a few more days. Newly married life was naturally happy, but Gao Guizhen was still thinking about her village, the report she would give after returning to China, and the summary of the work of the Youth League branch. She anxiously said: "It won't do to delay work!" Dong Shigui was also thinking about the work in the company, thinking about cultural studies. He also anxiously said: "When I go back, I must intensify my cultural studies, I can't fall behind!"
	On December 10th, Gao Guizhen returned to China. Dong Shigui saw her all the way to the train station. As the train departed, they waved to each other happily and smiled. This joy, this smile, expressed their confidence and strength. They must realize the determination they expressed at the wedding: he will be more vigilant in defending the motherland on the front line, and she will work harder to build the motherland in the rear. They deeply understand that their happiness is so closely connected with the motherland. (Attached picture)

    高桂珍在朝鲜
    若水
    深秋十月，朝鲜满山遍野是红色的枫叶。在一片掌声和欢呼声中，中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团第六总分团第二分团的汽车到达了金城前线的志愿军某部。
    慰问团里面最受人注意的代表是高桂珍。她的坚贞的爱，她的勇敢，温暖着每一个战士的心。战士们想起了高桂珍，就想起了自己的家，自己的爱人，或者自己理想中的姑娘。在国内的时候，高桂珍先后收到一千来封信。这些信绝大部分是从志愿军中寄来的。有的寄给她朝鲜的大蝴蝶，有的寄给她战地的枫叶，还有的寄给她立功相片。
    战士们多么渴望看到高桂珍本人啊！她走到那里，战士们便拥了上来，争着跟她握手，请她签名。听了高桂珍的报告，许多战士写信向她致敬。功臣杨进林送给她一块手绢，他在信上说：“我几夜也没有睡着，总想用一点礼品表示我的心情……这是我参加功臣大会时得到的手绢，虽然东西不好，却是我最心爱的。亲爱的桂珍同志，请你收下吧！”战士杨关根深深被高桂珍的模范事迹所感动，写信给他的未婚妻，希望她也做一个高桂珍式的未婚妻。
    高桂珍来到这里，仿佛来到了自己的家，看见了战士们，就像看到了自己的亲兄弟。她像给亲人叙家常一样，给战士们谈祖国的建设，谈今年的丰收，谈她们那个村子如何从“穷河南村”变成“富河南村”，谈她们那个村子的姑娘如何想当志愿军未婚妻的情形。谈到高兴的时候，常常发出爽朗的笑声。
    一次正谈得热闹时，一个战士要求说：“高大姐，你给我们唱一个歌吧！”
    高桂珍仰头想了一想，说，“我给你们唱一个村中流行的小调吧！”说完她就唱起来：
    ……英雄带上了光荣的花，
    他带上红花去串亲家。
    他是英雄我模范，
    我们俩真是金瓜配银瓜，
    金瓜配银瓜！
    听的人都会心地微笑起来。虽然英雄并没有机会去串亲家，可是模范却千里迢迢来会见英雄了。
    高桂珍到朝鲜后不几天，部队首长就派汽车去接她的爱人董世贵。十月十三日，估计是董世贵要来的日子，高桂珍显得特别高兴，洗了头，照了好几次镜子，整天笑眯眯的。黄昏时刻，她正在屋子外面解晒衣服的绳子，只听见一群人在屋子里嚷叫起来：
      “高桂珍你快来呀！他来啦！”
    高桂珍说：“哪里来了呀，你们瞎扯！”一面说，一面就向屋里飞跑。她一进门，董世贵就站起来了。
      “你好呀，世贵！”高桂珍说，大方地伸出了手。
    “你好呀，桂珍！”董世贵也说，他的脸红了。
    他们已经离别了六年，彼此几乎不认识了。他看她变了，由一个小丫头变成了一个大姑娘；她看他也变了，由一个毛头小伙子变成了一个魁梧的战士。六年前，他们在苦难中分离：她成天在家受苦；他呢，为了躲避抓丁，在柴堆里一动不动地蜷伏了六七天，最后终于被迫出走。而今，他们在幸福中会见了：她已是全国闻名的模范；他也是光荣的志愿军功臣。这六年发生了多么巨大的变化啊！
    他俩清楚地知道，这幸福是怎么来的。她亲手在他胸前佩上一枚镰刀斧头的纪念章和一枚毛主席像纪念章，让他时时刻刻记住共产党和毛主席。
    夜深人静，他们在房中谈心。她告诉他最近几年家中的情况和村里的事情；他告诉她部队的生活跟自己的立功事迹。他们交换了照片，相互在纪念册上题字，又订了竞赛计划。……
    十二月二日，在慰问团领导人和部队首长的提议下，他们结婚了。虽在战地，婚礼却是隆重而热烈的。慰问团领导人和代表，部队首长和干部都参加了这不平常的婚礼，为他们祝贺。
    第二天，慰问团回国了，把高桂珍留下来要她多住几天。新婚自然是幸福的，但高桂珍仍在想着自己的村子，想着回国后的传达报告，想着团支部的工作总结。她焦急地说：“误了工作可不行呀！”董世贵也在记挂着连队里的工作，记挂着文化学习。他也焦急地说：“我回去要加紧学习文化，可不能掉队呀！”
    十二月十日，高桂珍回国了，董世贵一直送她到火车站。车开了，他们彼此愉快地挥着手，笑了。这愉快，这笑，表示了他们的信心和力量，他们一定要实现婚礼上表示的决心：他在前线更加警惕地保卫祖国，她在后方更加努力地建设祖国。他们深深懂得，他们的幸福是和祖国如此血肉相连。（附图片）
