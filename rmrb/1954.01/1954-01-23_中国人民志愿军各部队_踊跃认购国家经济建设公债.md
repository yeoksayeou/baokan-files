Chinese People's Volunteer Army Units
Enthusiastically Subscribe to National Economic Construction Bonds

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army units are enthusiastically subscribing to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. Many organs and units have greatly exceeded their planned subscription amounts in a short period of time.

The cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army love their motherland and are deeply concerned about the motherland's socialist industrialization construction. Before the unit leadership organs announced the start of subscription to the National Economic Construction Bonds, many cadres and soldiers were already calculating their subscription amounts. Many cadres in the command organs of a certain Volunteer Army unit on the eastern front, after hearing the news that the Volunteer Army leadership organs were enthusiastically subscribing to the bonds, called the relevant departments one after another, requesting to start subscriptions. After the subscription began, at a cadre meeting held by the political department of this command organ, the cadres present subscribed to more than 600 percent of the planned amount in more than ten minutes. Another unit reached 1,500 percent of the planned amount shortly after the subscription began. The cadres and soldiers of the guard unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army leadership organs oversubscribed by seventeen and a half times the planned amount in thirty-six hours.

The cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army all regard this subscription to the bonds as a practical action to support the Party's general line for the transition period. Wang Shengru, a third-class merit recipient from a certain Volunteer Army unit on the central front, bought bonds with his three months' surplus allowance. He said: "Under the brilliant light of the general line, the people of the motherland are working hard to accelerate the construction of the motherland's socialist industrialization. By buying bonds with this surplus money, I have contributed to the motherland's socialist construction." Ding Chunfang, a supply officer of a certain unit, made an overall arrangement for his long-term savings. He used one million yuan to subscribe to bonds and sent the remaining five hundred thousand yuan to his mother to invest in production. He said: "Only when the motherland is well-built can the people's lives be guaranteed and can they be unafraid of disasters. This is the long-term interest of the people of the whole country, and my mother will definitely approve of my buying bonds."

Many heroes, meritorious persons, and soldiers below the platoon level also firmly demanded to subscribe to National Economic Construction Bonds. Shi Fengyou, a second-class merit recipient and soldier, bought bonds with his accumulated 300,000 yuan. He said: "We must not only bravely defend the motherland, but also strive to support the motherland's economic construction. The stronger the motherland is built, the less dare the imperialists will be to invade us." In one day, the amount subscribed by his company reached one-third of the planned amount for the entire regiment. While enthusiastically subscribing to the bonds, many cadres and soldiers of the guard unit of the Volunteer Army leadership organs also wrote letters to their families and relatives and friends, eagerly hoping that they would also enthusiastically subscribe to the National Economic Construction Bonds.

    中国人民志愿军各部队
    踊跃认购国家经济建设公债
    中国人民志愿军各部队踊跃认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债。许多机关和部队在短时间内，就大大超过了预定的认购数额。
    中国人民志愿军的干部、战士热爱祖国，深切地关心着祖国的社会主义工业化建设。部队领导机关还没有宣布开始认购国家经济建设公债，许多干部和战士就盘算着自己的认购数额了。东线志愿军某部指挥机关的许多干部，听到志愿军领导机关踊跃认购公债的消息后，纷纷打电话给有关部门，要求开始认购。认购公债开始后，在这个指挥机关政治部门召开的一次干部会上，到会的干部在十多分钟内，就认购了预定数额的百分之六百以上，另一个单位在开始认购后不久，就达到了预定数额的百分之一千五百。中国人民志愿军领导机关警卫部队的干部和战士，在三十六小时内，就超额认购了预定数额的十七倍半。
    中国人民志愿军的干部和战士，都把这次认购公债，当作拥护国家在过渡时期总路线的一项实际行动。中线志愿军某部三等功臣王胜如，把他节余下来的三个月的津贴费买了公债。他说：“祖国人民在总路线的光辉照耀下，正在努力加速祖国社会主义工业化的建设，我把这些余钱买了公债，就为祖国的社会主义建设尽了一分力量。”某部供给员丁春芳把长期积蓄下来的钱作了统盘支配，他把一百万元认购公债，把余下的五十万元寄给母亲投入生产。他说：“祖国建设好了，人民的生活才有保障，才会不怕灾荒，这是全国人民的长远利益，我母亲一定赞成我购买公债的。”
    许多排级以下的英雄、功臣和战士，也坚决要求认购国家经济建设公债。二等功臣、战士石凤友，把自己积蓄的三十万元买了公债。他说：“我们不但要英勇地保卫祖国，而且要努力支援祖国的经济建设，祖国建设得越强大，帝国主义才不敢侵犯我们。”他所在的连队，在一天内认购的数额，就达到全团预定数额的三分之一。志愿军领导机关警卫部队的许多干部和战士，在踊跃认购公债的同时，还写信给他们的家庭和亲戚朋友，热望他们也踊跃地认购国家经济建设公债。（新华社）
