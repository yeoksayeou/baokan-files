    [Xinhua News Agency] The Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals Company celebrated its third anniversary on January 2nd. Responsible comrades from the Party and government organs of Xinjiang Province and Dihua City attended the meeting to offer congratulations.

    Acting General Manager Druzhinin (Soviet side) delivered a report on the work of the Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals Company over the past three years. He said: The Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals Company is a prominent example of the close economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The achievements made in the past three years have made us believe that, on the basis of the existing established enterprises, with the necessary skilled workers and experts in our company, and with modern equipment and mechanized facilities, new production achievements will surely be made in 1954. Deputy General Manager Bai Chengming, on behalf of all Chinese employees, thanked all the Soviet experts and staff for their selfless work. He said: In the past three years, every comrade has experienced the responsible, sincere and frank internationalist spirit of the Soviet comrades, and has experienced the superiority of Soviet advanced technology and scientific management methods. He called on all Chinese employees to work harder to learn from the Soviet Union, learn from the valuable experience of Soviet socialist construction, and strive to complete the socialist industrialization of our country.

    In the past three years, the Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals Company has made great achievements in developing production, capital construction, and geological exploration. It has discovered very promising mineral bases and carried out mining; established power stations, mechanical ore dressing plants, and mechanical repair plants; implemented mechanized operations; and trained nearly three thousand skilled workers in seventy trades. The company's overall production is developing rapidly. The total value of mine production in 1952 increased two-fold compared to 1951, and increased another two-fold in 1953 compared to 1952.
