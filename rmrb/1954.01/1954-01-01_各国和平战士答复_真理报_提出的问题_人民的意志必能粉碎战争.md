Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30th: As the New Year approached, "Pravda" asked outstanding peace fighters from various countries how they assessed the achievements of the struggle for peace in 1953 and the prospects for the coming year. "Pravda" published their answers on a full page.

    "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize winner Pietro Nenni wrote: From the perspective of the struggle for peace and the easing of international tensions, the past year has brought us both achievements and hopes, hopes that have not yet been realized. The proposition of direct consultations between major powers has gained widespread support. Our task in 1954 is to strengthen public opinion's pressure on our governments, forcing them to agree to consultations and genuinely ease international tensions. This is not an easy task, but our prospects are bright.

    Former German Chancellor Joseph Wirth replied: The situation in West Germany has developed in a way that proves the conclusion that the will of the people can crush the plans of those who hope for war is correct. The powerful peace movement vividly illustrates that the people of all countries have the ability to force their governments to conduct peaceful consultations on all disputed issues.

    The aim of our policy is to enable the people to achieve national unity, independence, and peace; our policy opens up the possibility for Germany to be admitted into the international community as an independent, peace-loving, and democratic country.

    The Soviet government's note on the German question addressed all the issues that concern all relevant people. The Soviet government's initiative made the convening of a four-power conference possible. This conference could help protect the German people from the greatest threat – turning West Germany into a bridgehead, as stipulated in the Bonn and Paris treaties.

    "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize winner Ikuo Oyama spoke about the Japanese people's struggle for peace.

    He said: In Japan, the struggle for peace takes various forms. The most important of these is the nationwide movement against rearmament at the request of the American imperialists. The world has seen how the Japanese people, with all sorts of political beliefs and opinions, have united to fight against the retention of the current number of over seven hundred American military bases in Japan. The Japanese people are increasingly resolutely demanding the immediate withdrawal of foreign armed forces from Japan.

    We believe that the further development of the Japanese peace movement has very bright prospects. The Korean armistice has given the Japanese people's struggle for peace and national independence new impetus. We firmly believe that the recent World Peace Council meeting in Vienna will enable the Japanese peace movement to achieve new successes.
      
    "Pravda" also published answers from World Peace Council Vice-Chairman Gabriel D'Arboussier, "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize winner Sahib Singh Sokhey, Gustave Monod, a member of the Presidium of the French National Peace Council, and others.

### 各国和平战士答复“真理报”提出的问题  人民的意志必能粉碎战争

    各国和平战士答复“真理报”提出的问题
    人民的意志必能粉碎战争
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三十日讯：“真理报”在新年即将到来的时候，向各国杰出的和平战士提出问题，询问他们对争取和平的斗争一九五三年的成就和明年的前景作怎样的估计。“真理报”以整版的篇幅刊载了他们的答复。
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人彼特罗·南尼写道：从争取和平与缓和国际紧张局势的斗争的观点来看，即将过去的这一年既为我们带来了成就，也为我们带来了希望，这个希望到现在为止还没有实现。大国直接协商的主张得到了普遍的支持。我们在一九五四年的任务是要加强舆论对我们的政府的压力，迫使它们同意协商并真正缓和国际紧张局势。这不是一件容易的工作，但是我们的前景是光明的。
    前德国总理约瑟夫·维尔特回答说：西德的局势已经有了发展，这种发展证明：人民的意志能够粉碎希望战争的人的计划这个结论是正确的。强大的和平运动生动地说明：各国人民有能力迫使他们的政府在一切争执的问题上进行和平协商。
    我们的方针的目的是要使人民得到国家的统一、独立与和平；我们的方针给德国开放了作为一个独立的爱好和平的和民主的国家被准许加入国际大家庭的可能性。
    苏联政府关于德国问题的照会说出了使一切有关的人民感到不安的所有问题。苏联政府的倡议使四国会议的召开成为可能。这个会议能够有助于使德国人民免受最大的威胁——如波恩与巴黎条约所规定的：把西德变成一个桥头堡。
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人大山郁夫谈到日本人民争取和平的斗争。
    他说：在日本，争取和平的斗争采取了各种各样的形式。其中最重要的就是：在日本全国范围内展开的反对按照美帝国主义者的要求重新武装的运动。全世界都看到，具有各种各样的政治信仰和见解的日本人民，是如何团结起来进行斗争、反对在日本保留目前为数已超过七百的美国军事基地的。日本人民正越来越坚决地要求外国武装部队立即撤出日本。
    我们认为日本和平运动的进一步发展有十分光明的前景。朝鲜停战给予日本人民争取和平、争取民族独立的斗争以新的动力。我们坚信，最近的世界和平理事会维也纳会议将能使日本的和平运动得到新的成就。
      “真理报”还刊载了世界和平理事会副主席加布里尔·达波赛、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人萨希布·辛格·索克、法国全国和平理事会主席团委员古斯塔夫·摩诺以及其他人的答复。
