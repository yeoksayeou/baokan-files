    Worker-Peasant Mutual Aid Supports National Construction
    Agricultural Labor Model Han En
    1953 was the first year of our country's first Five-Year Plan. Over the past year, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have carried out many arduous tasks and achieved great results in all aspects. In terms of industrial construction, we have built and rebuilt many large factories. For example, the newly built seamless steel tube factory and large-scale rolling steel plant in Anshan, our country's steel capital, have been successfully completed with the help of Soviet experts; the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has also begun. The construction of these factories will play a significant role in our country's industrialization. These factories are just a few of the major new factories built in 1953. Even these are enough to show that the achievements our country has made in the first year of implementing the first Five-Year Plan are amazing.
    Our peasant brothers across the country, like the people of the whole country, have also learned many advanced production experiences and overcome and defeated many natural disasters in order to support national industrial construction and continuously improve our lives. We have also achieved great results in production. Take our cooperative as an example. In 1953, the 85 hectares of irrigated and dry land cultivated by the entire cooperative, although affected by various natural disasters, still achieved an output of 5,500 jin per hectare, an increase of 100 jin compared to 1952. Compared with the surrounding farmers, our output is 30% to 50% higher than theirs. The income of the cooperative members has increased significantly compared to previous years. In particular, the 23 farmers who newly joined the cooperative this year have seen their output increase by one to two and a half times compared to when they were in mutual aid teams. For example, Wang Zhonghe, who newly joined the cooperative in 1953, distributed a net of 27 shi and 4 dou of grain this year, several times more than when he was in the mutual aid team in 1952.
    We achieved these accomplishments in the first year of the country's first Five-Year Plan. As we bid farewell to the victorious year of 1953 and welcome the second year of the national Five-Year Plan—the New Year of 1954—our hearts, like those of the people of the whole country, are filled with indescribable excitement and joy.
    Recently, the farmers of our entire Bao'an Village have enthusiastically studied the Party's general line during the transition period. Through study, our confidence in transitioning to a socialist society has become even stronger. Cooperative member Zhang Shixian said: In the past, we only talked about moving towards a socialist society, but we didn't know when we would actually get there, and we weren't sure. After studying the general line this time, everyone feels like there is a purpose in life. The young people are even more encouraged, and the older cooperative members are also counting their years, hoping for the early arrival of a socialist society. The enthusiasm of the farmers in the whole village to participate in cooperative mutual aid has also increased. For two years, the farmers in our village and the surrounding villages have seen with their own eyes that our cooperative's income is higher than theirs, especially the vivid fact that we have overcome natural disasters for three consecutive years, which has made them realize that farmers can only overcome difficulties by participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and that this is the way for everyone to become prosperous. Now, 30 farmers in our village are actively asking to join our cooperative, and farmers from Erlong Village and Taiping Village in the Fifteenth District near us are also taking the initiative to join. They all say: Birds fly to bright places, and people go to higher places. Joining the cooperative gives you something to look forward to. I and all the members of the cooperative deeply know that if we farmers want to live a good life, we must have the support of the country's industry. In 1952, I accompanied the Chinese Farmers' Delegation to the Soviet Union and saw the happy life of the collective farm peasants with my own eyes. When I think about it today, it still seems like it was right in front of me. The reason why the Soviet peasants' lives are so happy is because the Soviet industry is developed and the state helps the peasants use machines to produce. We also firmly believe that under the leadership of our wise leader Chairman Mao and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, we will soon realize national industrialization after several Five-Year Plans. A few days ago, when all the members of our cooperative heard that the Soviet Union had agreed to provide systematic assistance in the construction and reconstruction of 141 large enterprises in our country, the cooperative members all said, "This is great. When we form a collective farm, the country will produce tractors, harvesters, seeders, etc., to help us produce." We will also gradually live a happy and beautiful life like the Soviet peasants. However, we also know that all good lives need to be created by ourselves. Because of this, in 1953, when the state called on farmers to sell surplus grain, the entire cooperative enthusiastically sold 100,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The cooperative members also wrote a letter to the farmer brothers in the entire Northeast, calling on them to also sell their surplus grain to the state to support national industrial construction. Later, we received many replies from farmer brothers, who all said that what we did was right and expressed their intention to learn from us and also sell their surplus grain to the state. As we celebrate the New Year of 1954, in addition to happiness and celebration, we must also take on the glorious tasks of 1954 with a hundredfold confidence. We know that the task that the state has given us farmers during the transition period is to produce more grain to meet the needs of the people of the whole country and the industrialization of the country. We feel that this task is supremely glorious. In order to realize the socialist industrialization of our motherland one day sooner, as we welcome the New Year of 1954, I want to lead all the members of our cooperative to use the practical actions of increasing the production of more grain and industrial raw materials to support national industrialization as a gift.

    工农互助支援推进国家建设事业
    农业劳动模范　韩恩
    一九五三年，是我们国家实行第一个五年计划的第一年。一年来，全国人民在共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，进行了许多艰巨的工作，在各个方面取得了很大成绩。在工业建设上，我们新建和改建了许多大工厂。像最近我国钢都鞍山新建的无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂，在苏联专家的帮助下，胜利地建成了；第一汽车制造厂也已开始进行建厂工作。这些工厂的建设对我国工业化将起很大作用。这些工厂，只是一九五三年许多个新建工厂中主要的几个。就是这些，也足以说明我们国家在实行第一个五年建设计划的第一年中，所取得的成就是很惊人的。
    我们全国的农民兄弟也和全国人民一样，为了支持国家工业建设，不断地改善和提高我们的生活，也学习了许多的先进生产经验，克服和战胜了许多自然灾害，在生产上也取得了很大的成绩。就拿我们合作社来说吧，一九五三年全社种的八十五垧水旱田地，虽然受到了各种自然灾害的侵袭，但每垧产量仍达到五千五百斤，比一九五二年增加了一百斤。和周围农民对比，我们的产量要比他们高三成到五成。社员们的收入都比往年增加了很多。特别是今年新参加合作社的二十三户农民，产量都比在互助组时增加了一倍到二倍半。像一九五三年新入社的王忠和，今年净分了二十七石四斗粮，比一九五二年他在互助组时，多了好几倍。
    我们在国家实行第一个五年计划的第一年中，就得到了这些成就。当我们在欢送胜利的一九五三年和迎接国家五年计划的第二年——一九五四年新年的时候，我们的心中也和全国人民一样，有着说不出来的兴奋和愉快。
    最近我们全保安村的农民，热烈地学习了党在过渡时期的总路线。经过学习，我们过渡到社会主义社会的信心更加强了。社员张世显说：过去光说往社会主义社会走，可是什么时候能走到，心里却没底。这回学习了总路线以后，大家都觉得有奔头了，年青的人更鼓足了勇气，年老的社员也都数算着自己的年岁，盼着社会主义社会的早日到来。全村农民参加合作互助的积极性也提高了。两年来，本村的农民和附近村的农民，都亲眼看到了我们合作社的收入比他们多，特别是我们连着三年战胜了自然灾害的生动事实，使他们认识到了农民只有参加互助合作组织才能克服困难，使得大家富裕的道理。现在我们村中就有三十户农民积极要求参加我们的合作社，我们邻近的二龙村和十五区太平屯的农民也主动要求参加。他们都说：雀往亮处飞，人往高处走，入了合作社，就有了奔头。我和全社的社员都深深知道，我们农民要想把日子过好，那就必须有国家的工业支持。一九五二年，我随同中国农民访苏参观团，在苏联亲眼看到了集体农庄农民的幸福生活，今天一想起来，还好像在眼前一样。苏联农民的生活所以幸福，是因为苏联的工业发达，国家帮助农民使用机器生产。我们也坚信，我国人民在我们英明的领袖毛主席领导下，在苏联对我们的无私帮助下，经过几个五年计划之后，也会很快实现国家工业化。前些天，我们全社的社员听到苏联答应在我国新建和改建的一百四十一项大企业中给以系统帮助时，社员们都说，这回就好了，咱要成立集体农庄，国家就会造出拖拉机、收割机、播种机等，帮助咱们生产了。我们也将逐步地过上像苏联农民那样美好的幸福生活。可是，我们也知道，一切好生活，都需要我们自己去创造。就因为这个，一九五三年当国家号召农民卖余粮时，我们全社就踊跃地把十万斤余粮卖给了国家。全社的社员并写了一封信给全东北的农民兄弟，号召他们也要把余粮卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。以后，我们接到了不少农民兄弟的回信，他们都说我们这样做得对，并表示要学习我们，也把余粮卖给国家。当我们在庆贺一九五四年新年的时候，我们除了高兴和欢庆之外，还要以百倍的信心担起一九五四年的光荣任务。我们知道国家在过渡时期交给我们农民的任务，就是要我们生产更多的粮食，来满足全国人民和国家工业化的需要，我们感到这个任务是无上光荣的。为了使我们的祖国早一天实现社会主义工业化，在迎接一九五四年新年的时候，我要领导我们全社的社员，用增产更多的粮食和工业原料，支持国家工业化的实际行动作为献礼。
