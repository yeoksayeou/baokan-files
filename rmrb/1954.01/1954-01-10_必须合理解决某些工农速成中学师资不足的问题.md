Reader's Letters Abstract

    The problem of insufficient teachers in some worker-peasant rapid middle schools must be rationally resolved.
    Editor's note: Equipping worker-peasant rapid middle schools with excellent teaching staff, running them well, and actively and systematically cultivating a new type of intellectual cadre from worker-peasant backgrounds to meet the needs of national construction is an aspect of the cultural and educational work concretely implementing the general line of the state during the transition period. According to readers' letters, the teacher shortage problem in some worker-peasant rapid middle schools has not been reasonably resolved since the beginning of this academic year. Some schools have not yet been fully staffed with teachers for certain major courses; although some schools have been equipped with a certain number of teachers, the quality of teaching is not high due to the lack of backbone teachers, which seriously affects students' learning.
    Of course, the shortage of teachers in secondary schools in our country is still a general problem. However, the situation reflected in readers' letters shows that the main reason for the shortage of teachers in some worker-peasant rapid middle schools is that the local educational administrative leaders have not regarded worker-peasant rapid middle schools as the focus of ordinary secondary education, and have not given priority to meeting the needs of worker-peasant rapid middle schools when allocating teachers. For example, Shijiazhuang Worker-Peasant Rapid Middle School lacks physics teachers, while Shijiazhuang Normal School has more physics teachers, but the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education did not make reasonable adjustments; according to a reader's letter published in this newspaper on October 10, 1953, the Zhangjiakou Prefectural Commissioner's Office also had an excessive number of physics and chemistry teachers, but the Hebei Provincial Department of Education did not make reasonable adjustments. Secondly, some units disregard the overall interests and are plagued by departmentalism, which also affects the rational allocation of teachers. The situation of the Shandong Provincial Troops Transferred Cadre Rapid Middle School accumulating teachers published today is also an example.
    The "Instructions on Running Worker-Peasant Rapid Middle Schools and Worker-Peasant Cadre Cultural Remedial Schools" of the Central People's Government Administrative Council had already pointed out that worker-peasant rapid middle schools "must be equipped with excellent teaching staff to undertake teaching and school affairs." Recently, the Central Higher Education Department and the Central Education Department also made specific provisions on the issue of teacher allocation for worker-peasant rapid middle schools in the "Regulations on the Leadership Relationship of Worker-Peasant Rapid Middle Schools." As long as we rationally allocate the existing teachers according to the above spirit and methods, we believe that the current problem of teacher shortage in some worker-peasant rapid middle schools can be appropriately resolved. It is hoped that the educational administrative departments will seize the gap during the winter vacation to appropriately solve this problem.

### 必须合理解决某些工农速成中学师资不足的问题

专栏：读者来信摘要

    必须合理解决某些工农速成中学师资不足的问题
    编者按：配备优良的教职员，办好工农速成中学，积极地、有计划地培养工农出身的新型知识分子干部，以适应国家建设的需要，这是文教工作具体贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线的一个方面。根据读者来信反映：这一学年开始后，某些工农速成中学的师资问题还没有得到合理的解决。有的学校某些主要课程的教师还没有配齐；有的学校虽然配备了一定数量的教师，但由于缺乏骨干，教学质量不高，严重地影响了学生的学习。
    当然，目前我国中等学校的师资不足还是一个普遍的问题。但是，从读者来信反映的情况可以看出，造成某些工农速成中学师资不足的原因，主要是当地教育行政领导机关没有把工农速成中学看成是普通中等教育的重点，在配备师资时，没有首先满足工农速成中学的需要。譬如石家庄市工农速成中学物理教师不足，而石家庄师范学校物理教师却较多，市文教局竟未加以合理调整；据本报一九五三年十月十日所刊读者来信，张家口专署也有理化教员过多的现象，而河北省教育厅也未加以合理调整。其次，某些单位不顾整体利益，有本位主义思想作祟，也影响了师资的合理调配。今天发表的山东省部队转业干部速成中学积压师资的情况也是例子之一。
    中央人民政府政务院“关于举办工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校的指示”中早已指出，对工农速成中学“须配备优良的教职员担任教学和校务”。最近中央高等教育部和中央教育部在“关于工农速成中学领导关系的规定”中对工农速成中学师资配备问题也作了具体规定。只要根据上述精神和办法，合理地调配现有师资，我们相信，目前某些工农速成中学师资缺乏的问题是可以得到适当解决的。希望教育行政部门抓紧寒假间隙，适当地解决这个问题。
