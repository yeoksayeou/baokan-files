Strengthen Learning, Unite the Masses, Strive for More Grain
Agricultural Labor Model Lü Hongbin

    The great year of 1954 has arrived, and I am truly filled with indescribable joy. In the past year, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has achieved a great victory, and our country has also achieved great accomplishments in developing production. After studying the Party's general line and general tasks for the transition period, we have strengthened our confidence in building socialism even further. Over the past year, our agricultural production cooperative has engaged in continuous struggle against various natural disasters, and finally achieved a bumper harvest. The cooperative's more than 700 mu of land yielded a total of more than 280,000 jin of grain, with an average yield of approximately 400 jin per mu, an increase of about 15 percent compared to 1952. This is all due to the result of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us down the path of organization. In order to support national construction, the entire cooperative has consciously and voluntarily sold more than 37,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Although we have achieved the above results, we must not be complacent in the slightest and must work even harder. Now is the beginning of the second year of the country's first five-year plan, and I believe that the people of the whole country must work in a down-to-earth manner in order to strive for the early arrival of socialism. I will focus on the following tasks this year: conscientiously lead all cooperative members to produce more grain, increase income, and support national construction. In addition to leveraging the potential of the cooperative's land and labor, seizing the key to increased production, and reducing costs, we also plan to plant 50 mu more of the high-yielding Golden Queen corn than last year, ensuring increased production compared to last year, and increasing the actual income of the cooperative members. At the same time, we will also ensure that all surplus grain within the cooperative is sold to the state, further supporting industrial construction. Therefore, I will definitely take the lead in participating in labor, listen to the opinions of cooperative members in a timely manner, fully promote democracy, strengthen unity within the cooperative, and move forward with everyone. I will also actively lead the expansion and improvement of agricultural production cooperatives. In addition to the fifteen households in our village who want to join our cooperative, farmers in the other four villages in the township also want to establish cooperatives. This will ensure that every village in the entire township has a cooperative. I will first improve my own cooperative, set an example, introduce experiences in a timely manner, and help brother cooperatives continuously improve and consolidate. In addition, I will also help and unite mutual aid teams and individual farmers, striving for the early establishment of large cooperatives, so that we can use tractors to cultivate the land, produce more grain, improve our lives, and support national construction. Finally, I will strengthen my study of politics and policies, as well as agricultural technology. I deeply feel that without studying politics and researching the Party's policies, one cannot progress, cannot educate cooperative members, and one's work will not be done well; without learning technology from the masses and accepting advanced agricultural technology experience, one cannot produce more grain. In summary, the Party has given us even more glorious and arduous tasks this year. I resolutely respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party and contribute all my strength to the agricultural production front.

    加强学习，团结群众，争取打更多的粮食
    农业劳动模范　吕鸿宾
    伟大的一九五四年来到了，这时，我真是有说不出的高兴。过去一年抗美援朝已经取得了伟大的胜利，我国在发展生产方面也获得了伟大的成就。我们学习党在过渡时期的总路线总任务以后，更加强了建设社会主义的信心。我们农业生产合作社一年来和各种自然灾害进行了不断的斗争，终于获得了丰收。全社七百多亩土地，共收粮食二十八万余斤，平均每亩产量约四百斤，比一九五二年每亩增产百分之十五左右。这都是由于共产党和毛主席领导我们走组织起来的道路的结果。为了支援国家建设，全社自觉自愿地已把三万七千余斤余粮出卖给国家。我们虽然获得以上成绩，但不能有丝毫骄傲自满，还要更加努力。现在是国家第一个五年建设计划进入第二年的开始，我认为全国人民必须脚踏实地地干，才能争取社会主义早日到来。我今年要搞好以下工作：认真领导全体社员多打粮食，增加收入，支援国家建设。我们除了发挥社内土地、劳动潜在力量，抓住增产关键，降低成本外，并计划再比去年多种高产量金皇后玉米五十亩，保证比去年增产，增加社员实际收入；同时并保证把社内全部余粮出卖给国家，进一步支援工业建设。因此，我一定带头参加劳动，及时听取社员意见，充分发扬民主，加强社内团结，和大家一道前进。我还要积极领导扩大和办好农业生产合作社。现在除本村要求参加我们社的十五户外，全乡其他四个村的农民也要求办社。这就可以做到全乡村村有社了。我要首先搞好自己的社，做出样子及时介绍经验，帮助兄弟社不断提高和巩固。另外，我还要帮助、团结互助组和单干农民，争取早日成立大合作社，以便使用拖拉机耕地，多打粮食，改善生活，支援国家建设。最后，我要加强对政治和政策以及农业技术的学习。我深深感到不学习政治，不研究党的政策，就不能进步，不会教育社员，工作就做不好；不向群众学习技术，不接受先进农业技术经验，就不能打更多的粮食。总起来说，今年党已给予了我们更加光荣而又艰巨的任务，我坚决响应毛主席和共产党的号召，在农业生产战线上贡献出我的一切力量来。
