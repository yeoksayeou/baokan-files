　　Shenyang City's eighty handicraft production cooperatives have achieved significant development under the leadership and support of the People's Government and the state-owned economy, demonstrating the superiority of being organized.
    Shenyang City has more than 10,000 handicraft workers. By the end of 1953, eighty handicraft production cooperatives had been organized, with more than 5,000 members, covering twenty-eight industries such as boots and shoes, sewing, and knitting. They can produce more than 400 kinds of handicrafts, with an annual total output value of several hundred billion yuan.
    The development of handicraft production cooperatives is inseparable from the vigorous support of the state-owned economy. For example, the state-owned banks provide large amounts of loans to handicraft production cooperatives every quarter. The government also provides preferential treatment in taxation. This creates conditions for handicraft production cooperatives to accumulate funds and expand reproduction.
    These production cooperatives have changed the original production relations in handicraft workshops, established cooperative relationships with everyone participating in labor and a democratic management system, and given full play to the initiative and creativity of handicraft workers. For example, the Shenyang Boots and Shoes Production Cooperative has nearly doubled its output since it switched to assembly line operations in 1952.
    Scattered handicrafts have always been blindly produced, with several months of "slack season" each year, so every year was "half busy and half idle." However, since being organized, state-owned stores have expanded processing orders for them, allowing for planned production according to needs. For example, the products of six of the eighteen cooperatives in the boots and shoes industry are entirely sold by state-owned stores, and the rest are also in contact with state-owned department stores, so the phenomenon of "slack season" has never occurred. Thirty-five percent of the products of the eight cooperatives in the food and candy industry are processed and ordered by various department stores, and forty percent are processed and ordered by various consumer cooperatives, so production is normal and production and sales are combined.
    Through continuous learning, the collective concept of the members has been strengthened, and public accumulation has also increased. Some industrial production cooperatives have added machines and improved equipment. For example, after retrofitting the motor in the Second Miscellaneous Textile Production Cooperative, one person can operate one and a half machines, increasing output by 80 percent. Publicly owned tools have also increased significantly.
    With the development of production, the lives of the members have also generally improved. Wang Chuntian, a member of the Heli Boots and Shoes Production Cooperative, worked for capitalists for fourteen hours a day, only resting two days a month, and only working eight months a year, being idle at home for four months, with an average monthly income of 650,000 yuan. After joining the cooperative, his average monthly wage is 757,000 yuan, working twelve months a year, nine hours a day, and resting four and a half days a month. Members of the Second Miscellaneous Textile Production Cooperative bought nineteen new bicycles and thirteen watches worth 1.5 million yuan. In addition to higher income, members can also receive a labor return bonus each year and enjoy various collective welfare benefits within the cooperative. Every family has enough to eat and wear, truly embarking on the road to common prosperity.

### 沈阳市手工业生产合作社获得显著发展

　　沈阳市手工业生产合作社获得显著发展
    沈阳市八十个手工业生产合作社，在人民政府、国营经济的领导和扶植下，获得显著的发展，显示出组织起来的优越性。
    沈阳市的手工业者共有一万多家，到一九五三年年底已组织起来八十个手工业生产合作社，社员五千多人，包括靴鞋、缝纫、针织等二十八个行业，可生产四百多种手工业品，每年生产总值达数千亿元。
    手工业生产合作社所以有这样的发展，是和国营经济的大力扶助分不开的。如国家银行每季度都给手工业生产合作社大量的贷款。政府在税收上也给以照顾。这就给手工业生产合作社的积累资金、扩大再生产，创造了条件。
    这些生产合作社，改变了原有的手工业作坊中的生产关系，建立了人人参加劳动的合作关系和民主管理制度，发挥了手工业者的积极性和创造性。如沈阳市靴鞋生产合作社，自从一九五二年改为流水作业法，产量提高将近一倍。
    分散的手工业，一向是盲目生产，每年有数月“淡季”，所以年年是“半年忙半年闲”，但是，由于组织起来后，国营商店对它们扩大加工订货，可以按照需要，进行有计划的生产。如靴鞋行业的十八个社，已有六个社的产品全部由国营商店包销，其余的也和国营百货公司联系，因而从未发生“淡季”现象。食品、糖果行业八个社的产品，有百分之三十五为各百货商店加工订货，有百分之四十为各消费合作社加工订货，因而生产正常，产销得以结合。
    社员经过不断学习，集体观念加强了，公共的积累也增加了，部分工业生产合作社增添了机器、改进了设备。如第二杂纺生产合作社，从改装电机后，一人可操纵一台半，产量提高百分之八十。公有的工具也有很大增加。
    随着生产的发展，社员的生活也普遍提高。合力靴鞋生产合作社社员王春田，给资本家干活时，每天工作十四小时，每月只休息两天，全年只干八个月活，四个月在家闲着，每月平均收入六十五万元；入社后，每月平均工资是七十五万七千元，每年工作十二个月，每天工作九小时，每月休息四天半。第二杂纺生产合作社社员，新买了十九台自行车和价值一百五十万元的手表十三只。社员除了收入多以外，每年还可得到一笔劳动返还金，还可享受社内各项集体福利。家家足吃足穿，真是走上了大家富裕的道路。
