    Peasants Enthusiastically Support the Baoji-Chengdu Railway
    Fu Bing
    Along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway line, hundreds and thousands of peasants are converging on the construction site from dozens or even hundreds of miles away, carrying rice and railroad ties; countless carts and wagons are continuously transporting tools, cement, and gravel to the construction site. Some peasants who transport wood to the construction site have to carry the wood over more than a hundred miles of treacherous mountains. When they are hungry on the road, they gnaw on a few cornbread cakes they carry with them, and when they are thirsty, they drink a few mouthfuls of spring water by the roadside. At night, they light a bonfire in the mountain gully and spend the night together. At the construction site, many peasants and railway workers work together day and night. Since the beginning of the road construction, many moving stories of peasants supporting the road construction have emerged.
    An eighty-year-old Chinese Cork Tree
    Yu Dezhi, a farmer in the Fourth Village of Puming Township, Mianyang County, couldn't sleep well one night when he heard that the railway construction required many railroad ties. The next morning, he rushed to the township government to ask to sell the tree in front of his house to the state. Little did he know that others were just as anxious as he was and had arrived early. The township government was crowded with people, one holding the township chief's hand and saying, "The cypress tree in my house has been growing for decades, it's thick and straight"; another asking the township chief to see if the trees in his house were qualified. The township cadres looked at Yu Dezhi's tree and felt that it was a pity to use his tree as a railroad tie, so they didn't buy it. This made Yu Dezhi very anxious. It turned out that the old Chinese cork tree in front of his house had been growing for more than eighty years, and it was so thick that two people couldn't hug it. In the past, people had asked him to buy it many times, but he was unwilling to sell it, saying, "How can I be willing to sell a tree left by my ancestors?" But this time was different, he said, "Building the railway is something everyone has been looking forward to for many years, I must do my part." So he went to the township government to request it again and again, and finally "supported" the tree.
    Good Stones in the Cornfield
    The 16th Stone Working Team went to the Songshuwang construction site of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway to quarry stones, and the waste stone accounted for 42 percent in the first month. One night, the workers held a meeting to specifically discuss how to reduce waste, but everyone lowered their heads and couldn't think of a solution. Someone said, "The mountain field is not good, the stone has dry cracks and watermarks, what should we do?" At this time, Zhang Chonglin, a military dependent, said from the back of the meeting, "Comrades, you are here to build the motherland. You also take the time to help us pick up firewood, carry water, and thresh grain. I hate myself for not being able to think of a way to repay you. Didn't you just say that there are no good mountain fields? I have a lot of good stones in my cornfield, go and quarry them!" Early the next morning, Zhang Chonglin led the workers to see, and it was indeed a good piece of blue stone. The stone workers of the 16th Team calculated that there were more than 500 cubic meters of blue stone in this field, and they couldn't finish it in five months. Since the quarrying of this piece of blue stone, the 16th Team has eliminated waste and won the red flag of the 1st Tunnel Team.
    Dragon Bone Waterwheel
    The section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway from Chengdu to Mianyang is low-lying, with crisscrossing rivers, requiring the construction of many bridges and culverts. When draining water, there were not enough water pumps; the few water pumps available often had problems at the critical moment of digging the foundation. As soon as the water pump had a problem, the water would gush out like a spring, quickly filling the pier. In this way, the cement work had to be stopped. When the nearby peasants learned about this, they knew that these bridges and culverts had to be completed before the flood season, but at the current rate, it would be impossible to complete them. So, one after another, they carried the dragon bone waterwheels used for farming to the side of the foundation pit and started working. The drainage capacity of three dragon bone waterwheels is equivalent to that of a four-inch water pump. When the peasants saw such results and were praised by the workers, they all smiled with satisfaction.
    "I will raise my two nephews"
    Xiang Jianmei, a farmer at the construction site of the Fujiang River Bridge, suddenly received a letter from home saying that his wife had died. What a blow this was to him! Xiang Jianmei was in a state of confusion, not knowing what to do. Should he go home? The work at the construction site was at a critical juncture, how could he bear to leave? If he didn't go back, who would take care of the two young children without a mother? Just as he was undecided, his wife's younger brother came from home to comfort him and said, "It is a great honor for you to participate in the construction of the motherland! I will raise my two nephews; I will take care of my sister's funeral. Wait until the bridge is built, then you can go home."
    "It's nothing for me to do my part for the opening of the train"
    In the 309th Team of the 4th Engineering Section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, there is a 76-year-old farmer named Guo Dawan. As soon as he arrived at the construction site, he carried soil, carried stones, moved cement, and pushed a wheelbarrow, working very hard at everything. When the workers saw that he was so old, they advised him, "Grandpa, take a rest! Don't fall!" But he replied, "Comrade, it's nothing, I can still beat a young man! I don't feel tired even after pushing a wheelbarrow for a day, I just want to be satisfied when I see the train!" Speaking of building the railway, Guo Dawan is very enthusiastic, he remembers things from many years ago: "Chiang Kai-shek shouted for many years to build the railway, cheated us of our money, and didn't see a train shadow. After liberation, the Communist Party came to build the railway, and in less than two years, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was built. Soon the train will come to us. I have lived for 76 years, if it weren't for the railway construction, I wouldn't even know what a car looks like. You think, it's nothing for me to do my part for the opening of the train!"

    热情地支援宝成铁路的农民们
    符冰
    在宝成铁路线上，有成百成千的农民，从数十里甚至数百里外的地方，扛着大米、枕木向工地涌集；有数不尽的马车、板车，接连不断地向工地输送着工具、水泥和沙石。有些农民往工地运送木料，要扛着木头翻越一百多里的险山。路上饿了，他们就啃几口带在身边的包谷饼，渴了，就喝几口路旁的泉水，夜晚在山沟里烧起一堆篝火，几个人围在一起过夜。在工地里，许多农民和铁路工人一起，日日夜夜地工作着。从开始修路以来，出现了不少感人的农民支援筑路的故事。
    一棵长了八十多年的黄连树
    绵阳县普明乡第四村的农民禹德之，有一天听说修铁路需要很多枕木，高兴得一夜没睡好。第二天一清早，他就急急忙忙跑到乡政府，要求把自己门口的树卖给国家。那知道，别人也和他一样心急，老早就赶来了。乡政府里挤满了人，这个拉着乡长的手说：“我家的柏树长了几十年，又粗又直”；那个要乡长看看他家的树够不够格。乡干部看了禹德之的树，觉得他的树作枕木太可惜了，没买他的。这一下可把禹德之急坏了。原来他门口那棵老黄连树长了八十多年了，树粗得两个人都抱不过来。过去人家向他买过许多次，说什么他也不肯卖，他说：“祖宗留下的一棵树，我怎么能舍得卖掉呢？”可是这回不同了，他说：“修铁路是大伙盼了多年的事，我一定得出点力。”于是他三番五次地跑到乡政府去请求，最后总算把那棵树“支援”了。
    包谷地里的好石头
    石工十六班到宝成铁路的松树湾工地采石，第一个月废石料就占了百分之四十二。一天晚上，工人们开会专门讨论减少废料的办法，但大家都低着头想不出法子。有人说：“山场不好，石头有干缝水纹，怎么办？”这时，军属张崇林在会场后边说道：“同志们来这里是为了建设祖国，你们抽空还帮我们拣柴、担水、挞谷子，我恨自己想不出办法来报答你们。刚才你们不是说没有好山场吗？我有一块包谷地里倒是有很多好石头，你们去开吧！”第二天一早，张崇林领着工人去看，果然是一片青色的好石头。十六班的石工算了算，这块地共有五百多立公方青石，五个月都打不完。自从开采了这一片青石，十六班便消灭了废料，获得了第一隧道队的红旗。
    龙骨水车
    宝成铁路成都到绵阳一段，地势低洼，江河纵横，需要架设许多桥梁和涵管。排水时，抽水机不够用；仅有的一些抽水机，在挖基的紧要关头，还常出点毛病。抽水机一有毛病，水就像泉涌一样，很快就涨满了桥墩。这样，打水泥工程就不得不被迫停止。这事情被附近的农民晓得了，他们知道这些桥梁和涵管都要在洪水期前修好，可是像现在这样下去，无论如何是完不成的。于是你一架他一架把种田的龙骨水车抬到基坑旁，动手干起来。三部龙骨水车的排水量能顶上一部四吋口径的抽水机，农民们看到这样的成绩受到工人赞扬的时候，大家都满意地笑了。
    “两个外甥，我来抚养”
    农民向建眉在涪江大桥的工地上，忽然接到一封家信说：他的妻子死了。这对他是多么大的一个打击呵！向建眉心乱如麻，不知如何是好，回家去吧，工地的活正在紧要关头，怎能舍得丢下？不回去吧，没有娘的两个小孩子谁来看管？正在他拿不定主意的时候，妻子的弟弟从家里赶来安慰他说：“你参加祖国建设，是再光荣不过了！两个外甥，我来抚养；姐姐的后事，我来料理。等桥修好，你再回家。”
    “为了通火车，我出点力算得了啥”
    宝成铁路第四工程段三○九中队里，有一位七十六岁的老农郭大万，他一到工地，就挑土、抬石头、搬水泥、推鸡公车（推东西的独轮车），什么活都干得很起劲。工人见他这样大年纪，劝他说：“老大爷，你休息吧！不要跌倒了！”他却回答说：“同志，没啥，我还能顶一个小伙子呢！推一天的鸡公车，我也不觉得累，我只要见到火车就心满意足了！”谈起修铁路，郭大万的劲头可大了，多少年代的事，他都记得起来：“蒋介石闹了多少年要修铁路，骗去了我们的钱，没见个火车影子。解放后共产党来修铁路，没到两年，成渝铁路就修起来了。不久火车也要来到我们这里。我活了七十六岁，要不是修铁路，连汽车像个啥样子，都不晓得。你们想，为了通火车，我出点力算得了啥！”
