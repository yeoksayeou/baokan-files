    Preparatory work for the construction of the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is being accelerated.

    The construction bureau for the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has already drafted an outline plan for the entire year's engineering work, a construction organization plan for the first quarter, and a material transportation plan. The main labor force participating in road construction has also been allocated. Currently, stone ballast collection teams are working hard to collect stone ballast, and telephone lines from Baoji to the Qinling construction site are being erected. A large number of road construction materials, such as rock drills, generators, and crawler cranes, are being continuously transported from all over the country to Baoji and the Qinling construction site. Materials for building houses at the Qinling tunnel construction site have been completely transported to Qinling.

    The major projects for the first quarter construction of the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway include the 2,300-meter-long Qinling Tunnel and the 390-meter-long Wei River Bridge. The task is quite arduous. The engineering bureau of this section recently transferred more than 20 technicians and surveying workers to assist the design department in surveying, designing, and preparing budgets, to ensure on-time construction.

    宝成铁路北段积极进行施工准备工作
    宝（鸡）成（都）铁路北段工程的施工准备工作正在加速进行。
    宝成路北段施工工程局已经编制好全年的工程轮廓计划、第一季度施工组织计划和材料运输计划。参加筑路的主要劳动力也已调配就绪。现在，石碴采集队正在紧张地采集石碴，从宝鸡到秦岭工地的电话线也正在架设。大批的筑路器材如开山机、发电机、爬行吊车等正在从全国各地源源运送到宝鸡和秦岭工地。秦岭隧道工地准备修筑房屋用的材料，已全部运送到秦岭。
    宝成路北段第一季度施工的有长达二千三百多公尺的秦岭隧道、三百九十多公尺的渭河大桥等主要工程。任务相当繁重。该段工程局最近抽调了二十多名技术人员及勘测工人，帮助设计部门进行勘测、设计、编制预算等工作，以保证按时施工。
