Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 26th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission received copies of letters from all the prisoners of war in the Songgok-ri POW camp to Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and Major General Thorat, Commander of the Indian Custodial Forces, requesting their agreement and assistance in coming to the Korean-Chinese side to live freely, from the Korean Red Cross Society and the Chinese Red Cross Society. The full text of the letter is as follows:

"To Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and Major General Thorat, Commander of the Indian Custodial Forces:

　　We are resolutely opposed to repatriation, although the Korean-Chinese side had been constantly persuading us to return home until we were handed over to the Indian Custodial Forces for custody. Our situation is completely different from that of the POW camps on the United Nations Command side that hold non-directly repatriated POWs.

　　Most of us have heard the explanations from the United Nations Command side. We have clearly and unmistakably stated our reasons for refusing repatriation. There is still a small number of us who have not heard the explanations. We have repeatedly requested the United Nations Command to provide us with explanations. However, the United Nations Command refused our request to hear explanations and abandoned all explanation work.

　　The issue of non-directly repatriated POWs should have been handled by a higher-level political conference according to the 'Terms of Reference.' However, the U.S. government has again obstructed the convening of a higher-level political conference.

　　Under these clear facts, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should declare and release us as civilians. However, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not only did not do so, but treated us the same as the POWs in the POW camps on the United Nations Command side, and similarly decided to hand us back to the original detaining party (the Korean-Chinese side) still as POWs. This is absolutely unjust.

　　We firmly disagree with this action, and therefore we requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces to continue to be responsible for our custody so that we could truly obtain civilian status according to the scheduled procedures, but the Indian Custodial Forces withdrew their custody of us, leaving us in a state of unclear status. We believe that this situation is extremely unreasonable.

　　The decision taken by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces is a complete violation of their neutral position and humanitarian stance. You know that we are definitely against repatriation. We resolutely demand to go to the Korean-Chinese side. Our goal has not been achieved so far. We bear no responsibility in this regard.

　　Therefore, we now request you to agree and assist us in requesting the Korean-Chinese side to consider us as free people and to receive us as free people. You are very clear about our situation. We sincerely believe that you will help us.

　　The entirety of former United Nations Command prisoners of war who refuse repatriation.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(All signed)"

　　北部战俘营全体战俘致函蒂迈雅和托拉特将军
　　要求同意他们作为自由人由朝中方面接收
    【新华社开城二十六日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团从朝鲜红十字会和中国红十字会接获了松谷里战俘营全体战俘要求中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将及印度看管部队司令托拉特少将同意并协助他们到朝中方面自由居住的函件的副本。该函全文如下：“中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将印度看管部队司令托拉特少将
    我们是坚决拒绝遣返的，虽然朝中方面在直到我们被移交给印度看管部队看管以前都曾不断劝说我们回家。我们的情况和联合国军方面收容未直接遣返战俘的战俘营的情况比较起来是完全不同的。
    我们当中大多数已听过了联合国军方面的解释。我们已经明确无误地表明了我们拒绝遣返的理由。我们当中还有一小部分尚未听过解释。我们曾数次要求联合国军司令部对我们进行解释。但联合国军司令部拒绝了我们的听取解释的要求，并且放弃了所有的解释工作。
    未直接遣返的战俘的问题，按照‘职权范围’本应由高一级的政治会议来处理。但美国政府又阻挠了高一级政治会议的召开。
    在此种明白的事实之下，中立国遣返委员会就应该宣布并释放我们为平民。但中立国遣返委员会不仅没有这样作，反而把我们和联合国军方面的战俘营中的战俘一样看待，并且同样决定要把我们仍然以战俘身份交还给原拘留方（朝中方面）。这是绝对不公正的。
    我们坚决不同意这种行动，因而我们曾要求中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队继续负责看管我们，使我们得以根据预定程序真正取得平民身份，但印度看管部队却又撤退对我们的看管，把我们置于身份不明的状态之下。我们认为这种状况是极不合理的。
    中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队采取这个决定是完全违背它们的中立地位与人道立场的。你们知道我们是肯定地反对遣返的。我们坚决要求到朝中方面去。我们的目的至今未能实现。在这方面我们不负任何责任。
    因此现在我们要求你们同意并协助我们要求朝中方面认为我们是自由的人，而且把我们当自由的人来加以接收。你们是非常清楚地了解我们情况的。我们诚恳地相信你们一定会帮助我们。
        全体拒绝遣返的前联合国军被俘人员
                        （全体签名）
