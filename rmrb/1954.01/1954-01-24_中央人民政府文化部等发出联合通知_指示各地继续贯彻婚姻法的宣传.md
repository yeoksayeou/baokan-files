The Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Education, the Illiteracy Elimination Work Committee, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government jointly issued a notice instructing all levels of people's governments to continue propaganda for the Marriage Law in winter school work and Spring Festival rural cultural activities.

The joint notice pointed out that because rural work tasks are currently heavy, the State Council of the Central People's Government has decided not to carry out a Marriage Law implementation movement this spring. However, the regular work of publicizing the Marriage Law must still be carried out in conjunction with various central tasks and the regular business of relevant departments. The Central Ministry of Education and the Central Illiteracy Elimination Work Committee have already stipulated in the "Instructions on Winter School Work in 1953" that propaganda for the Marriage Law should be appropriately linked to the education of the general line for peasants. The Central Ministry of Culture also stipulated in the "Instructions on Carrying Out Spring Festival Rural Cultural Activities to Propagandize the General Line to Peasants" that propaganda for the Marriage Law should continue. To this end, all localities should:

	I. The winter school curriculum should include content that promotes the Marriage Law. Especially winter schools that have not ended before International Women's Day on March 8th should have several lessons on the Marriage Law; in addition to students, the masses should also be mobilized to listen. If the winter school in the area has ended, it should be carried out in the people's school. In addition to relying on the political instructors of winter schools and people's schools, teachers can also hire cadres who participated in the Marriage Law implementation movement in 1953 and have been trained or can correctly understand the spirit of the Marriage Law. The "Talks on the Marriage Law" compiled and printed by the Office of the Central Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee should be used as teaching material. All localities can explain to students based on the content of the teaching material and in light of local actual conditions.

	II. During the Spring Festival cultural activities, in addition to showing the thirteen films stipulated in the instructions of the Ministry of Culture, the China Film Distribution Company will select screening programs related to the propaganda of the Marriage Law (such as "Zhao Xiaolan", etc.) and notify local distribution agencies to distribute them to local screening units for screening. When cultural centers and stations in various places guide rural amateur troupes and other mass amateur entertainment organizations to carry out Spring Festival activities, they can appropriately add programs to promote the Marriage Law. The cultural authorities in various places should immediately contact relevant units to review short plays, clapper talks, songs, New Year pictures, and comic strips related to the propaganda of the Marriage Law, and then recommend them.

    中央人民政府文化部等发出联合通知
    指示各地继续贯彻婚姻法的宣传
    中央人民政府文化部、教育部、扫除文盲工作委员会、内务部联合发出通知，指示各级人民政府应在冬学工作和春节农村文艺活动中，继续贯彻婚姻法的宣传。
    联合通知指出：由于目前农村工作任务繁重，中央人民政府政务院已决定今春不进行贯彻婚姻法运动。但宣传婚姻法的经常工作，仍须结合各种中心工作及各有关部门的经常业务进行。中央教育部、中央扫除文盲工作委员会在“关于一九五三年冬学工作的指示”中已规定向农民进行总路线教育时，应适当联系到婚姻法的宣传；中央文化部在“关于开展春节农村文艺活动向农民宣传总路线的指示”中也规定：仍应继续贯彻婚姻法的宣传。为此，各地应：
    一、在冬学的课程中，应包括有宣传婚姻法的内容。特别在“三八”妇女节以前尚未结束的冬学，应有几次讲婚姻法的课程；除学员外，并动员群众来听。如该地冬学已结束，则在民校中进行。教员除依靠冬学、民校的政治教员外，还可聘请参加过一九五三年贯彻婚姻法运动、受过训练或能正确领会婚姻法精神的干部充任。以中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室编印的“婚姻法讲话”为教材。各地可根据教材内容，结合当地实际情况，向学员讲解。
    二、在春节文艺活动中，各地除放映文化部指示中规定的十三部影片外，并由中国电影发行公司选择有关宣传婚姻法的放映节目（如“赵小兰”等），通知各地发行机构发交各地放映单位放映。各地文化馆、站在辅导农村业余剧团及其他群众业余文娱组织进行春节活动时，可适当加入宣传婚姻法的节目。各地文化主管部门应即联系有关单位，对有关宣传婚姻法的短剧、快板、歌曲及年画、连环画等，加以审查后，予以推荐。　（新华社）
