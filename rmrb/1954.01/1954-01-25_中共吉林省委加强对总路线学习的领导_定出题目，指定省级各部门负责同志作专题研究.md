The CCP Jilin Provincial Committee, according to the instructions of the CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau, stipulated specific methods for cadres in the province to study the General Line, requiring cadres to closely integrate study with reality and their work. Leading comrades of various departments should, in conjunction with their work, write summaries on specific topics that include information, analysis, and conclusions. These summaries should be discussed within their units and at senior group study meetings before being reported to all cadres or at relevant work conferences. This is intended to give cadres a more concrete understanding of the work situation and problems in the province and their respective departments, so that they can better implement the General Line in their future work.

The Provincial Committee set specific topics for special research and required the responsible comrades to complete them by January:

	I. The Party's leadership over state-owned enterprises, the development policy for local industry, and basic construction issues.
	II. Developing the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, reforming agricultural technology, and rural political work.
	III. The connection between commerce and urban-rural economy, the economic management of state-owned commerce, the role of supply and marketing cooperatives, and the political work of commercial departments.
	IV. The principles and tasks of financial work, and the role of taxation in transforming private industrial and commercial enterprises.
	V. Issues of state capitalism, united front work during the transition period, and ethnic issues during the transition period.
	VI. How to implement the socialist transformation of handicrafts.
	VII. How judicial, procuratorial, public security, and civil affairs work can serve the General Line.
	VIII. Party organizational construction during the transition period and the training of cadres for national construction.
	IX. Criticizing and overcoming the influence of capitalist ideas among cadres, raising the communist ideological awareness of the working people, and how cultural and educational work can serve the General Line.

The Provincial Committee also stipulated that responsible comrades of industrial and mining party committees and party organizations at the county committee level and above must make several special reports to cadres in light of the work and ideological situation of their respective regions and departments. At the same time, they should carry out the struggle against various erroneous ideas among cadres in a guided and planned manner, and improve and strengthen the work of political theory education.

In order to ensure that this study of the General Line can indeed improve work and raise the level of ideological understanding, the Provincial Committee required party committees at all levels to regard the work of leading cadres in studying and publicizing the General Line as one of the central tasks in their current work, guiding cadres to study the General Line in depth. It also stipulated that examinations should be conducted in appropriate ways during and at the end of the study process.
