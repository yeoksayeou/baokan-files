    The People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region
    Supports the Development and Production of Handicraft Industry

    The People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province attaches great importance to supporting the development and production of local handicraft industries. Before the autumn harvest last year, the Autonomous Region People's Government conducted a survey of local handicraft production. Recently, at the first handicraft representative conference of the Autonomous Region, it further learned about the initial development of handicraft production such as ironworkers and carpenters. For example, the ironworkers of Menghai in Banna, with the support of the People's Government, organized 21 farm tool groups, which produced more than 3,000 pieces of farm tools in the spring of 1953, supplying them to farmers of all ethnic groups for spring plowing and repairing tea gardens. According to the investigation and understanding, the production potential of handicrafts in the Autonomous Region is still very large. In addition to planning to increase the purchase of handicraft products such as local cloth, paper, umbrellas, brown sugar, and camphor, the Autonomous Region Trade Company has also decided to sign processing contracts with local ironworkers, carpenters, textile workers, dyeing workers, and other handicraft producers to expand production. At present, the Autonomous Region Trade Company has sent people to Kunming and other places to purchase a large number of steel raw materials, preparing to supply ironworkers to process and manufacture agricultural tools. The local People's Bank of China will also make handicraft loans one of the key points of lending, and has now sent 11 loan groups to various places to provide loans.

    西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府
    扶助手工业发展生产
    云南省西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府，重视扶植当地手工业发展生产。自治区人民政府在去年秋收以前，曾调查了当地的手工业生产。最近并在自治区第一次手工业代表会议上，进一步了解了铁工、木工等手工业生产初步发展的情况。如版纳勐海的铁工，在人民政府扶助下，组织了二十一个农具小组，在一九五三年春天就制作了三千多件农具，供给各族农民春耕生产和整修茶园。根据调查了解，自治区手工业的生产潜力还很大，自治区贸易公司除计划增加收购土布、纸张、雨伞、红糖、樟脑等手工业产品外，并决定和当地的铁工、木工、纺织、染布等手工业生产者订立加工合同，扩大生产。现在自治区贸易公司已派人到昆明等地采购大批钢铁原料，准备供给铁工加工制造农具。当地中国人民银行也将手工业贷款作为贷款重点之一，现已派出十一个贷款小组分赴各地贷放。
