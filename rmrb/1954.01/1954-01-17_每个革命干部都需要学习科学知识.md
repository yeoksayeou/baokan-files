Every Revolutionary Cadre Needs to Study Scientific Knowledge
Gao Shiqi

Stalin taught us, "To build, one must have knowledge, one must master science." This is a famous saying that every one of our revolutionary comrades must firmly remember. However, some of our revolutionary comrades still do not pay enough attention to studying scientific knowledge; some even have the view that studying scientific knowledge is only the business of engineers, doctors, and agronomists.

This view is incorrect. Il’in, in his article "Talk About Science," once said: "Communism is built on the basis of science, and the surface of the earth is also reconstructed according to science. Millions of children and adults in the Soviet Union are studying science in order to control nature." It can be seen that studying science is not only necessary for engineers, doctors, and agronomists, but also for general revolutionary cadres. Especially today, when our country is following Chairman Mao's instructions and striving to realize the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, studying scientific knowledge is of even greater significance.

Cadres in industrial and mining enterprises need to study scientific knowledge. As Comrade Gao Gang pointed out in his report to the Third Meeting of the Northeast Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League on September 25, 1952: "Our current situation is that the level of technical management and business management in industrial production still lags far behind the needs of production development; and new enterprises equipped with the latest technology need to start learning from scratch. In capital construction, from surveying and design to construction and installation, we have encountered difficulties due to insufficient technical strength, and various losses and wastes have occurred more often than in the production sector. All this focuses on one issue, which is the need to train a large number of cadres who master technology and are proficient in business."

Currently, many new cadres have been added to various industrial and mining enterprises. Among these cadres, some have never been in contact with modern industry, and they undoubtedly need to work hard to learn scientific knowledge. It is hard to imagine that a factory or mine leader who lacks scientific knowledge or has no interest in learning science would do a good job leading a factory or mine. It is hard to imagine that an administrative cadre in the industrial and mining sector who lacks scientific knowledge or has no interest in science would do a good job in material supply, warehouse management, and other work.

Rural work cadres also need to study scientific knowledge. This is also obvious. To carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, a lot of work needs to be done, and improving agricultural science and technology and using new agricultural tools and new farming methods is an important part of it. This is not only a matter for agricultural technical cadres, but also for general rural work cadres. Now, to lead farmers to increase production, rural work cadres must learn new agricultural science and technology, master advanced experience in agricultural production, learn to use new agricultural tools, understand new cultivation methods such as wide sowing, dense planting, and flat cultivation, understand Wangtong seed dressing and warm water seed soaking, and understand the operation methods and scientific principles of seed purification and corn hybridization. Rural work cadres are the bridge between agricultural science and technology and the masses. If rural work cadres understand science and technology, they can better summarize the production experience of the masses and raise it to a scientific level.

Do cadres in government agencies also need to study scientific knowledge? The answer is yes: they also need to study. Because we know that the dialectical materialist worldview is built on the solid foundation of natural science. If we do not have a correct understanding of many issues in the history of natural development, such as the structure of matter, the formation of the universe, the origin of the earth, the origin of life, the evolution of organisms, and the origin of mankind, then how can we establish a materialist worldview?

Therefore, Lenin and Stalin have repeatedly instructed us that all those who wish to cultivate themselves into people with a Marxist worldview should be well versed in science. Lenin also said to the members of the Youth League: "Only by enriching one's mind with all the treasures of knowledge created by mankind can one become a communist."

Every one of our revolutionary cadres shoulders the task of building a socialist and communist society, so we should follow the instructions of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin and advance towards science.

It should be pointed out that for some cadres, learning science is difficult, but this difficulty is not insurmountable. Due to the lack of opportunities to come into contact with scientific and technological knowledge in the past, these cadres can only make up for it in their spare time now. Of course, it is not easy. Sometimes they have to sacrifice some rest time after work, and sometimes they have to give up some cultural and entertainment activities to study. But as long as we work hard, strictly demand ourselves, and allocate time reasonably, we can still study without leaving our jobs. What should be paid attention to here is to never retreat in the face of initial difficulties.

Learning scientific knowledge cannot be successful "in a flash." We must bury our heads in hard work, follow the steps, and proceed step by step. We must learn from the great Lenin and Stalin, learning their tenacity and perseverance in studying science.

The most important thing in learning science is to humbly ask for advice, not be ashamed to ask those below, and often study the experiences of others and absorb the ideological achievements of others as the cornerstone of our progress. Learning science is a very meticulous and rigorous work, and we must not be careless or perfunctory. Only in this way can we learn the necessary scientific and technological knowledge.

### 每个革命干部都需要学习科学知识

    每个革命干部都需要学习科学知识
    高士其
    斯大林教导我们说：“要建设，就必须有知识，就必须掌握科学。”这是我们每一个革命工作同志都必须牢牢记住的一句名言。但我们有些革命工作同志，对于学习科学知识仍不够重视；甚至有的同志有这样一种看法，那便是学习科学知识只是属于工程师、医生、农学家的事。
    这看法是不对的。伊林在他的“谈谈科学”一文中曾说过：“共产主义是在科学的基础上建立起来的，地球的表面也是根据科学来重建的。苏联的千百万儿童和成年人都在研究科学，为的是控制自然界。”由此可见，学习科学，不仅对工程师、医生、农学家是必要的，就是对一般革命工作干部，也同样是必要的。特别是在今天，我们国家正遵循着毛主席的指示，为实现国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造而奋斗的时期，学习科学知识就更具有特别重大的意义。
    工矿企业部门的干部需要学习科学知识。正如一九五二年九月二十五日，高岗同志在中国新民主主义青年团东北委员会第三次会议上的报告中所指出的：“我们目前的情况是：在工业生产方面，技术管理和经营管理的水平，仍大大落后于生产发展的需要；而新的以最新的技术装备起来的企业，更需要从头学起。在基本建设方面，从勘查、设计到建设和安装，都遇到了技术力量不足的困难，发生的各种损失和浪费，比较生产部门更多。这一切，就集中在一个问题上，就是要大量培养掌握技术和精通业务的干部。”
    目前，各工矿企业中，增加了不少新的干部。在这些干部中间，有些人是从来没有接触过现代工业的，他们无疑地需要努力学习科学知识。一个缺乏科学知识或对学习科学没有兴趣的厂矿领导人，很难想像他会做好一个厂矿的领导工作；一个缺乏科学知识或对科学缺乏兴趣的工矿企业部门中的行政工作干部，很难想像他会作好材料供应、仓库管理等工作。
    农村工作干部也需要学习科学知识。这道理也是明显的。要对农业进行社会主义改造，就需要作许多工作，而提高农业科学技术，运用新的农具和新的耕作方法，正是其中的重要一项，这不仅是农业技术干部的事情，也是一般农村工作干部的事情。现在，要领导农民提高生产，农村工作干部就必须学习新的农业科学技术，掌握农业生产中的先进经验，要学会使用新式农具，懂得宽播、密植、平作等新的栽培方法，懂得王铜拌种和温汤浸种，懂得种籽纯化和苞米杂交等等的操作方法和它的科学道理。农村工作干部是农业科学技术和群众结合的桥梁。如果农村工作干部懂得科学技术，就能更好地总结群众的生产经验，把它提高到科学水平。
    机关工作干部是否也需要学习科学知识呢？回答是肯定的：也需要学习。因为我们知道，辩证唯物主义的世界观就是建立在自然科学的坚实基础上的。假若我们对于自然发展史方面的许多问题，如物质的构造，宇宙的形成，地球的起源，生命的起源，生物的进化，人类的起源等，没有正确的认识，那怎么建立唯物主义的世界观呢。
    所以列宁和斯大林曾多次地指示我们：一切愿意把自己培养成具有马克思主义世界观的人，都应当通晓科学。列宁对青年团员并这样说过：“只有用人类创造出来的全部知识宝藏来丰富自己的头脑时，才能成为共产主义者。”
    我们每一个革命工作干部，都肩负着建设社会主义、共产主义社会的任务，因此就应当遵循着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的指示，向科学进军。
    应当指出，对于一部分干部来说，学习科学是有困难的，但这个困难也不是不可以克服的。由于过去接触科学技术知识的机会较少，这些干部现在只能在工作之余来补习，当然不是容易的事情，有时候要牺牲些工作后的休息时间，有时候要放弃些文化娱乐活动时间来进行学习，但我们只要努力，严格要求自己，合理地支配时间，还是可以在不脱离工作的原则下进行学习的。这里应该注意的，是永远也不要在初步困难面前退却。
    学习科学知识，不可能“三下两下”就可以获得成功的，必须埋头苦干，按部就班，循序渐进。要向伟大的列宁和斯大林学习，学习他们研究科学的顽强性和坚毅性。
    学习科学最需要的是虚心请教，不耻下问，经常研究别人的经验，吸收别人的思想成果，作为自己前进的基石。学习科学是十分细致、严谨的工作，决不能粗枝大叶和漫不经心。只有这样，我们才能学习到必备的科学技术知识。
