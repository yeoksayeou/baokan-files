(Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, January 21st) TASS, The Hague, January 20th: The Dutch newspaper "Truth" reported that a national rally against the revival of German militarism and against the "European Army" treaty was held in Amsterdam. 1,500 representatives from all strata of the Dutch people participated in the rally. The delegates unanimously decided to unite to prevent the ratification of the "European Army" treaty. The conference wrote a letter to the members of the Upper House of the Dutch Parliament, urging them to "comprehensively study all possible consequences of this treaty before making a decision on such an important issue."

Representatives from the blast furnace workers in Velsen, the shipyard workers in Rotterdam, the Royal Dutch Airlines workers, the dockworkers of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Zaandam, students, doctors, sailors, and actors participated in the rally.

The conference received many congratulatory telegrams from peace fighters in other countries.

Brandson, the secretary of the Dutch General Trade Union, stated that the Dutch government's attempt to ratify the "European Army" treaty was at the behest of the United States. He said that the purpose of this treaty is to establish a military alliance headed by the revanchist West German fascists. Brandson said: "Opposition to the 'European Army' treaty expresses the opinion of the majority of the Dutch people because we are opposing a new fascist army, opposing destruction, and opposing new wars." Renken, a member of the Labour Party, exposed the true purpose of the "European Army" treaty at the conference. He criticized the Labour Party newspapers for refusing to publish articles protesting the "European Army." He also said that West Germany will hold a leading position in the planned "European Army." Renken called on the Dutch people to resolutely fight against the establishment of the "European Army."

    荷兰举行反对“欧洲军”大会
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社海牙二十日讯：荷兰“真理报”报道，在阿姆斯特丹举行了一次反对德国军国主义复活、反对“欧洲军”条约的全国大会，参加大会的有各阶层荷兰人民的代表一千五百人。大会代表一致决定联合起来，阻止“欧洲军”条约得到批准。大会写了一封信给荷兰议会上议院议员，敦促他们在“这样一个重要问题上作决定以前，全面研究这个条约的一切可能的后果”。
    维尔森的鼓风炉工人，鹿特丹造船厂的工人、皇家荷兰航空公司的工人、阿姆斯特丹、鹿特丹、桑达姆的码头工人、学生、医生、海员和演员等都有代表参加大会。
    大会收到其他国家和平战士的许多致敬电。
    荷兰总工会书记布兰德森发言指出，荷兰政府想使“欧洲军”条约得到批准是出于美国授意。他说，这个条约目的在于建立一个以复仇主义的西德法西斯为首的军事联盟。布兰德森说：“反对‘欧洲军’条约表达了多数荷兰人民的意见，因为我们是在反对一支新的法西斯军队，反对毁灭，反对新战争。”劳工党人士伦肯在大会上揭发了“欧洲军”条约的真正目的。他抨击劳工党报纸拒绝刊载抗议
  “欧洲军”的文章。他又说，西德将在策划中的“欧洲军”里居于领导地位。伦肯号召荷兰人民坚决进行斗争，反对成立“欧洲军”。
