The Director of the State Planning Bureau, B. Szalai, made a report on the 1954 National Economic Plan at the meeting on the 22nd. He pointed out that in 1954, socialist industrial production will increase by 4.5 percent, of which consumer goods production will increase by 16 percent. Retail trade turnover will increase by 20 percent. Compared with the average output of the past five years, agricultural production will increase by 8 percent. Agricultural investment will increase to 24 percent of total investment (14 billion forints). Investments in culture, education, labor protection, and housing construction will be appropriately increased. Compared with 1953, coal production will increase by 6.4 percent, electricity by 10.7 percent, and steel by 5.9 percent. This year, the production of consumer goods will be greatly increased, and their quality will be improved. Industries that help promote agricultural production will be greatly developed. The machinery manufacturing industry will produce 4,000 tractors, 5,500 tractor-drawn plows, 1,000 threshing machines, and other agricultural machinery. Agriculture will also receive more fertilizers and pesticides. Heavy industry will be further consolidated. In agriculture, the plan stipulates that the sown area of ​​grain should account for 35 percent of the total cultivated land area, and the grain problem should be solved within a few years, that is, not only to ensure that residents have sufficient grain supply, but also to enable the country to have the necessary reserves. Livestock breeding will also be improved so that residents can get more meat and animal products. Agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers will receive strong support from the state. The plan also stipulates tasks in developing domestic and foreign trade, transportation, culture, and education. Szalai finally called on the people of the whole country to do their best to improve labor productivity, reduce product costs, to complete this plan, further improve the people's welfare, develop the national economy, and consolidate national defense, and take another step forward on the road of building socialism.

On the 23rd, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Imre Nagy, made a report at the meeting on the implementation of the administrative program in the second half of 1953 and the 1954 plan.

After Nagy's report, many deputies spoke at the meeting one after another. After the meeting passed a decree on the establishment of the Municipal Construction and Public Utilities Department, it was declared closed.

Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: According to a TASS dispatch from Budapest on the 24th: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, Imre Nagy, made a report at the National Assembly meeting on the 23rd on the implementation of the administrative program in the second half of 1953 and the 1954 plan.

Nagy pointed out that Hungarian socialist industry completed 101.3 percent of the production plan last year, which was 11.8 percent higher than in 1952. In the second half of 1953, investment in heavy industry increased by 35.5 percent compared with the first half of the year, investment in light industry increased by 169.9 percent, and investment in the food industry increased by 203.5 percent. The production of consumer goods increased significantly in the second half of last year. For example, the production of flannel increased by 40.2 percent compared with the first half of the year, shoes increased by 17.9 percent, meat increased by 10.1 percent, grease increased by 22.4 percent, butter increased by 28.5 percent, and sweets increased by 75.2 percent. The socialist retail trade turnover in the second half of last year increased by 27 percent compared with the first half of the year. Due to the reduction of prices, the turnover of goods increased even more. The flow of agricultural products into the market has also greatly increased. In November 1953, market prices averaged 13.3 percent lower than in November 1952. In 1953, Hungary reduced retail prices twice. In the four months of last year alone, workers and staff benefited 550 million forints from these two price reductions; in 1954, they will benefit 1.2 billion forints from this. Farmers also benefited 490 million forints from the price reduction. Last year, the wages of workers in some industrial sectors increased, and their income increased by 762 million forints. In the second half of last year, the total direct investment in agriculture increased by 70.1 percent compared with the first half of the year.

Nagy said: All this proves that the government regards improving the material and cultural standards of the working people as its top priority. Since the implementation of the land reform in 1945, the unity between cities and villages, the unity between workers and peasants, and the unity between all social strata have never been as close as they are today, because we are today implementing a plan to develop agriculture. The reason why the goals stipulated in the government's administrative program can be achieved is due to the selfless labor of the working people and the great help from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

Nagy then talked about the tasks in industry, agriculture, trade and culture in 1954.

Speaking of the international situation, Nagy said: The tendency of easing international tensions enables us to expand international economic relations. We are willing to trade with all countries on an equal footing, including capitalist countries, and first of all with those countries that are directly adjacent to our country. The convening of this session of the National Assembly coincides with the eve of the convening of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. We will continue to demand that Western countries fulfill the promises they made when concluding the peace treaty and allow Hungary to join the United Nations organization. In order to consolidate the peaceful relations between our country and other countries, and to establish effective cooperation on the basis of mutual understanding and mutual respect for each other's interests, we will do our best. This is the main purpose of the peaceful policy supported by all the working people of our country.

　　匈牙利国民议会讨论今年国民经济计划
　　部长会议主席纳吉在会上作了重要报告
    【新华社布拉格二十五日电】布达佩斯消息：匈牙利人民共和国国民议会二十一日到二十三日在布达佩斯举行了会议。匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会书记马·拉科西、部长会议主席伊·纳吉、共和国主席团主席伊·道比等都参加了会议。
    国家计划局局长伯·萨拉伊在二十二日的会议上作了关于一九五四年国民经济计划的报告。他指出：一九五四年社会主义工业生产将增加百分之四点五，其中消费品的生产将增加百分之十六。零售贸易流转额将增加百分之二十。和过去五年的平均产量比较，农业生产将增加百分之八。农业投资将增加到占全部投资（一百四十亿福林）的百分之二十四。文教、劳动保护、住宅建筑的投资将适当地增加。和一九五三年比较，煤产量将增加百分之六点四，电力百分之十点七，钢材百分之五点九。今年将大大增加消费品的生产并改进其质量。有助于促进农业生产发展的工业，将大大发展。机器制造业将生产四千部拖拉机，五千五百部拖拉机曳引犁，一千部打谷机和其他农业机器。农业并将得到更多的肥料和杀虫药剂。重工业将进一步得到巩固。在农业方面，计划规定粮食的播种面积应占全部耕地面积的百分之三十五，要在数年内解决粮食问题，即不但要使居民得到充足的粮食供应，并且要使国家有必要的储备。饲畜业也将加以改进，使居民得到更多的肉类和畜产品的供应。农业生产合作社和个体农民都将得到国家的大力帮助。计划还规定了在发展国内外贸易、运输、文化、教育等方面的任务。萨拉伊最后号召全国人民竭尽全力提高劳动生产率、降低产品成本，以完成这个计划，更进一步增进人民的福利，发展国民经济和巩固国防，在建设社会主义的道路上再前进一步。
    二十三日，部长会议主席伊·纳吉在会上作了关于一九五三年下半年施政纲领的执行情况和一九五四年计划的报告。
    纳吉报告后，许多议员相继在会上发言。会议在通过了一项关于成立市政建设和公用事业部的法令后，即宣告闭幕。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯二十四日讯：匈牙利人民共和国部长会议主席伊·纳吉，二十三日在国民议会会议上作了关于一九五三年下半年施政纲领的执行情况和一九五四年计划的报告。
    纳吉指出，匈牙利社会主义工业去年完成生产计划百分之一百零一点三，比一九五二年提高了百分之十一点八。一九五三年下半年在重工业中的投资比上半年增加了百分之三十五点五，轻工业的投资增加了百分之一百六十九点九，食品工业的投资增加了百分之二百零三点五。消费品的生产在去年下半年有了很大的增加。例如，法兰绒的生产比上半年增加了四十点二，鞋子增加了百分之十七点九，肉类增加了百分之十点一，油脂增加了百分之二十二点四，牛油增加了百分之二十八点五，糖果增加了百分之七十五点二。去年下半年的社会主义零售贸易流转额比上半年增加了百分之二十七。由于减低了物价，商品流转额增加得更多。流入市场的农产品也大大增加了。一九五三年十一月市场上的物价平均比一九五二年十一月减低了百分之十三点三。在一九五三年，匈牙利两次减低了零售价格。仅在去年的四个月内，工人和职员就从这两次减低物价中获得了五亿五千万福林的好处；在一九五四年，他们从这里面得到的好处将达十二亿福林。农民也从减低物价中获得了四亿九千万福林的好处。去年某些工业部门的工人的工资提高了，他们的收入增加了七亿六千二百万福林。去年下半年对农业直接的投资总额比上半年增加了百分之七十点一。
    纳吉说：所有这一切都证明，政府把提高劳动人民的物质和文化水平看作是它的头等重要的任务。自从一九四五年实行土地改革以来，城市和乡村的团结、工人和农民的团结、社会各阶层之间的团结从来没有像今天这样紧密，这是因为我们今天在实行着发展农业的计划。政府施政纲领中所规定的目标之所以能够达到，是由于劳动人民的忘我的劳动，是由于苏联和人民民主国家的巨大帮助。
    纳吉接着谈到了一九五四年在工业、农业、贸易和文化等方面的任务。
    在谈到国际形势时，纳吉说：国际紧张局势的趋向缓和使我们能够扩大国际经济关系。我们愿意在平等的基础上和一切国家进行贸易，包括资本主义国家在内，而首先是和那些与我国直接相邻的国家进行贸易。国民议会这次会议的召开，恰逢四国外长会议召开的前夕。我们将继续要求西方国家履行在缔结和约时所作的诺言，允许匈牙利加入联合国组织。为了巩固我国和其他国家之间的和平关系，为了在互相谅解、互相尊重彼此利益的原则的基础上建立有成效的合作，我们将竭尽我们的力量。这就是我国全体劳动人民所支持的和平政策的主要目的。
