Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 3rd: TASS reports from Delhi: The protest movement in India against the proposed aggressive US-Pakistan military treaty is growing. The "Hindustan Times," which consistently expresses the views of the Indian government, published a dispatch from its Karachi correspondent stating: It has been learned from highly reliable sources that the United States' aid to Pakistan in 1954 is tentatively set at seventeen destroyers, four heavy warships, and three thousand aircraft. In addition, the Pakistani government will receive three to four million pounds, mainly to modernize airfields, especially those located in the north, such as the airfields in the Gilgit area.

Indian newspapers report that more and more Indian people are joining the protest movement against the proposed aggressive US-Pakistan military treaty.

The "Times of India" reported: Jagannath Narayan, Chairman of the Punjab branch of the Indian National Congress, said in a speech at a mass meeting that this treaty between the United States and Pakistan is a threat to the democratic system of all countries.

According to the "Hindustan Flag," Dr. Meghnad Saha, Member of Parliament and a famous scientist, said that India will resolutely fight against the threat bred by the US-Pakistan alliance.

The "Hindustan Flag" also said that the Nepalese public is also protesting against the aforementioned US-Pakistan military treaty. Prasad Upadhyaya, a leader of the Nepalese National Congress, said that this alliance is a threat to the sovereignty of other independent countries.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 3rd: According to the Indian News Agency, Afghan Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan said on December 31, 1953: In his view, the United States' military aid to Pakistan is a serious threat to peace and the security of Afghanistan.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: TASS, Kabul, 1st: An editorial in "Friendship" newspaper said, "Afghanistan's opposition to the US-Pakistan military treaty is entirely justified." The newspaper believes that such a treaty is a threat to the peace and security of the Middle East. "Friendship" pointed out: The main obstacle to a military treaty between the United States and Pakistan is the desire of the people of all countries—including the Afghan people—for peace and security.

Afghan provincial newspapers also oppose the US-Pakistan military treaty. An editorial in "Ittifaq-i-Islam," published in Herat, said: We declare with particular emphasis that this treaty threatens the security of all countries bordering Pakistan and the entire Middle East.

    印度反对美巴军事同盟的运动日益壮大
    阿富汗总理指责美巴军事同盟威胁阿国的安全
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社德里讯：印度反对拟议中的侵略性的美国巴基斯坦军事条约的抗议运动正在壮大。一向表达印度政府意见的“印度斯坦时报”刊载该报驻喀喇蚩特派记者的一条消息说：从十分可靠人士处获悉，一九五四年美国给予巴基斯坦的援助暂时定为驱逐舰十七艘、重型军舰四艘和飞机三千架。除此之外，巴基斯坦政府将得到三百万到四百万英镑，主要用来使飞机场现代化，特别是座落在北部的，例如吉尔吉特区的飞机场。
    印度报纸报道：正有更多的印度人民加入反对拟议中的侵略性的美巴军事条约的抗议运动。
    “印度时报”报道：印度国大党旁遮普分部主席贾干特·纳拉扬在一个群众大会上演讲时说，美国和巴基斯坦两国之间的这一条约，对所有国家的民主制度都是一个威胁。
    据“印度斯坦旗报”消息：国会议员、著名科学家麦格纳德·萨哈博士说，印度将和美巴同盟所孕育的威胁作坚决的斗争。
    “印度斯坦旗报”并说：尼泊尔公众也对上述美巴军事条约表示抗议。尼泊尔国大党的一位领袖普拉萨德·乌帕达雅说，这个同盟是对其他独立国家的主权的一个威胁。
    【新华社新德里三日电】据印度新闻处报道，阿富汗总理穆罕默德·达乌德汗于一九五三年十二月三十一日说：照他看来，美国对巴基斯坦的军事援助是对和平和阿富汗的安全的严重威胁。
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社喀布尔一日讯：“友谊报”社论说，“阿富汗反对美巴军事条约是完全正当的。”该报认为这样的一个条约是对中东的和平与安全的威胁。“友谊报”指出：美国与巴基斯坦之间的军事条约的主要障碍，就是各国人民——包括阿富汗人民在内——对和平与安全的愿望。
    阿富汗省级报纸也反对美巴军事条约。在赫拉特出版的“伊蒂法克·伊斯兰报”的社论说：我们特别强调地宣布，这一条约威胁着作为巴基斯坦邻邦的各国和整个中东的安全。
