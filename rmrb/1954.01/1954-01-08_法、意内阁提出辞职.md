Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 4th: According to newspaper reports, French Prime Minister Laniel submitted his resignation to President Vincent Auriol on January 2nd. Auriol did not accept Laniel's resignation. Therefore, Laniel sent a letter to Édouard Herriot, Speaker of the National Assembly, requesting that a special session of the parliament be convened on January 6th.

Laniel intends to make a statement on French foreign policy on the eve of the Berlin Four-Power Conference at the National Assembly session. After his statement, the head of government may raise the question of confidence.

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 6th: The Italian Pella cabinet submitted its resignation to the President on the evening of the 5th because irreconcilable divisions existed within the ruling Christian Democratic Party.

It was previously reported that Pella had been working on a cabinet reshuffle for days, attempting to resolve the government crisis caused by internal disagreements within the Christian Democratic Party through the reshuffle. According to news reports, after days of negotiations, Pella drafted a new government list that included representatives of the party's major factions. This list was rejected at the last minute by the majority of the Christian Democratic Party's parliamentary group. Pella then decided to resign.

Reuters reported: "This cabinet crisis appears to basically reflect a state of uncertainty that has plagued the Christian Democratic Party for six months, namely, not knowing how to stop the growth of communist power in Italy."

    法、意内阁提出辞职
   【新华社六日讯】塔斯社巴黎四日讯：据报纸报道，法国内阁总理拉尼埃一月二日向总统樊尚·阿里奥尔呈递辞职书。阿里奥尔不接受拉尼埃的辞职。于是拉尼埃便致函国民议会议长爱德华·赫里欧，请求在一月六日召开议会特别会议。
    拉尼埃想在国民议会的会议上发表关于柏林四国会议前夕的法国外交政策声明。在他的声明以后，政府的首脑可能提出信任的问题。
   【新华社六日讯】罗马消息：意大利贝拉内阁在五日晚向总统提出辞呈，原因是统治的政党天主教民主党内部分歧无法调和。
    前已报道，贝拉连日来曾努力内阁的改组事宜，企图能通过改组来解决因天主教民主党内部意见分歧引起的政府危机。据新闻报道，经过几天的折冲之后，贝拉拟出了一个包罗党内各主要派系代表的新政府名单。这个名单在最后一分钟又遭到天主教民主党议会党团多数的拒绝。贝拉于是决定辞职。
    路透社报道说：“这次内阁危机看来基本上是反映六个月来一直苦恼着天主教民主党的一种不定状态，就是不知道该如何制止共产党力量在意大利的增长。”
