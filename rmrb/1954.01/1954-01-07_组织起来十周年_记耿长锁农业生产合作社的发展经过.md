Ten Years of Organization
    ——A Record of the Development of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Chen Jiemin, Xiao Feng, Zhi Qing

    December 1953 marked the tenth anniversary of the organization of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wugong Village, Raoyang County, Hebei Province.

    The ten-year history of this production cooperative illustrates that "getting organized" is the road to prosperity for farmers. The ten years have been full of twists and turns, overcoming many difficulties to finally grow from four households in 1944 to 287 households last year. It is like a flower seed that, after being sown and germinating, finally blooms into a beautiful flower; it is like a flag fluttering over the plains of Hebei, calling on all farmers in the province to take the bright road of socialism.

      Beginning to Establish "Land Cooperation Groups"

    In 1943, the people of the Jizhong Revolutionary Base Area were in an extremely difficult situation after the Japanese invaders' major "mopping-up" operations and a severe drought. At that time, the Party called on farmers to organize and develop production. Qiao Wanxiang, a member of the Communist Party in Wugong Village, responded to the Party's call and used 200 catties of red grain loaned by the government to start engaging in cooperative sideline production. At the beginning of the spring plowing in 1944, land cooperation was implemented on this basis, with labor and land dividing profits equally, establishing "Land Cooperation Groups." Geng Changsuo also joined the cooperation group at this time.

    In this year, the group encountered many difficulties. For production, there were no livestock or farm tools; for life, there was no grain, and the enemy constantly came out to loot. They had to dig the ground with a large hoe during the day and return at night to twist hemp rope together, sell the hemp rope to earn some money, and buy back grain to mix with bran and vegetables to eat. In this way, they barely managed to sow the seeds.

    Although many difficulties were experienced this year, the severe famine was finally overcome, and the group's yield reached an average of 220 catties per mu, more than 50 catties more than ordinary farmers.

      Establishment of a Production Cooperative

    The superiority displayed by the "Land Cooperation Group" in 1944 showed the farmers in the village that "getting organized" was the road to prosperity, and thirteen more households requested to join the group. In order to reward labor, the group stipulated that land would receive 40% of the profits and labor 60%. At that time, Geng Xiufeng was elected as the director, Geng Changsuo as the head of the sideline production group, and Zhang Jinren as the head of the agricultural group. Soon, Geng Xiufeng left production to participate in work, and everyone elected Geng Changsuo as the director.

    In this year, households with more land and less labor felt that their land was allocated too little, and they were not energetic in their work; some people had the idea of taking advantage when joining the group, and the group constantly educated them. Even so, by the winter of 1945, eight households had finally withdrawn. At this time, the Land Cooperation Group had only nine households left. After that, the group adopted a steady approach, absorbing two or three households each year, reaching nineteen households by 1951.

    From 1950, the Land Cooperation Group was renamed the Agricultural Production Cooperative, and production increased year by year. In 1944, the average yield per mu was only 220 catties, but by 1950, the average yield per mu reached 470 catties, and in 1951, it reached 487 catties, exceeding 131.8% of the pre-war production level, doubling that of local individual farmers. Sideline production also developed on a larger scale. From 1951, the cooperative changed to dividing profits with land receiving 50% and labor 50%.

    In the years of getting organized, through rent reduction and rent investigation, and land reform, most of the members were allocated land, and the production enthusiasm of the members was greatly improved; coupled with the strong support of the government, the yield of the land increased, and the lives of the members gradually improved. Not only were they all able to eat and use enough, but they could also invest in the cooperative. Everyone saw the benefits of the Agricultural Production Cooperative, and in 1951, six more farming households joined the cooperative.

      Demonstrated Superiority During Famine

    1952 was the year in which the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative suffered the most serious drought and insect plagues. In the face of the disaster, it experienced another serious test.

    This year, after a rain before the wheat harvest, there was no thorough rain until the autumn harvest was completed. The insect plague was also very serious, especially the red spider. The cotton leaves withered, some fell off; peanuts, beans, sorghum, and even trees were covered with a layer of reddish paste. The farmers said, "It's over, we're waiting to starve to death!"

    The members of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative were not panicked in the face of the severe disaster. Under the leadership of the Party branch (the Party and Youth League branch committees were established in the cooperative from 1952), they discussed how to overcome the disaster and decided to start together as a cooperative to fight against the drought and insect plagues. Each production team launched a labor competition to "ensure a good harvest."

    At the newly dug well, livestock pulled the waterwheel day and night, using well water to irrigate the land. The land far from the well was high, and the water could not flow past, so they used the method of "collective labor" to irrigate. Thirteen mu of cotton that could not be irrigated with water were organized into a water-carrying group and continuously irrigated three times.

    The women of the pest control group, led by Geng Sujuan, secretary of the Youth League branch, divided into two groups and sprayed red spiders day and night, spraying cotton during the day and peanuts at night. They sprayed continuously for thirty days, spraying 30,000 catties of pesticides, and finally protected the cotton and peanut harvest.

    The hard work of the male and female members for several months was rewarded. This year, the average yield of cotton per mu was 240 catties, and the cotton in the high-yield area reached 370 catties per mu, while the households outside the cooperative only harvested 40 catties of cotton per mu; the average millet yield per mu in the cooperative was 210 catties, while the households outside the cooperative were only around 100 catties, and the comparison of unit area yield between the cooperative and the outside was very different.

    The fact that the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative achieved victory in the struggle against disasters once again educated the farmers: only by getting organized can we overcome disasters, get rid of poverty, and move towards a prosperous life. From then on, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the whole village greatly developed. Originally, there were only four small-scale agricultural production cooperatives in the whole village. After the autumn harvest, they suddenly developed into twenty, and the number of mutual aid teams also developed to twelve. The number of households organized in the whole village reached 81% of the total number of households in the village.

      Running a Small Cooperative into a Large Cooperative

    After the autumn harvest in 1952, the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Wugong Village increased, and the village Party branch committee needed to further strengthen its leadership. However, almost every one of the eleven branch committee members was leading a cooperative or a team. Most of the energy and time of the branch committee members were spent on leading the work of their own cooperative or team, and they rarely considered the work of the whole village. In this way, the urgent tasks that the higher-level requested the village branch to complete were often not completed because the branch committee members were held back by the work of their own cooperative or team. At the same time, with more cooperatives, there were also more problems, and many problems could not be solved in time; there were also some tasks that, due to the lack of leadership, had a phenomenon of blindly doing things. For example, when preventing drought, everyone was busy digging wells, but they all started from their own cooperative or team. If wells could be dug in the east of the village, all the cooperatives and teams would dig there, regardless of how much land they had in the east of the village; no one had ever dug a well in the south of the village, so no one wanted to try there, fearing that it would cost a lot of money and fail. Therefore, the wells in the east of the village were "crowded together", and there was not a single well in the south.

    At this time, Geng Changsuo returned from a visit to the Soviet Union and vividly reported to the farmers in the village about the production and living conditions of the Soviet farmers. The report, like a powerful magnet, attracted the farmers of the whole village. They envied the collective farmers of the Soviet Union and felt that small cooperative group farming was still restricted and could not fully exploit the potential for production. Therefore, they eagerly requested to merge into a large cooperative.

    The time to run a large cooperative was ripe. The branch committee first led all Party members to discuss, unify the work of the Party and the actions of all Party members, and solve the problems that were occurring in mutual aid and cooperation. As a result of the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed to merge the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative and other cooperatives and groups into one large cooperative. The branch also mobilized the masses for discussion through the Party members in each cooperative and group, with the cooperative and group as the unit. The farmers had long clearly seen the prosperous life of the members of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative and were very willing to merge into a large cooperative.

    Then, the branch committee led everyone to discuss the principled issues of the cooperative - profit distribution, methods of joining the cooperative (including how livestock and farm tools would join the cooperative), and cadre issues. When discussing these issues, some farmers expressed their opinions solely from the perspective of their own immediate interests, and it was difficult to reach complete agreement. For example, on the issue of profit distribution, those with more land advocated more profit distribution for land, and those with more labor advocated more profit distribution for labor; those with waterwheels wanted to estimate the price of waterwheels high, and those without waterwheels wanted to estimate the price of waterwheels low. The branch committee adopted the method of repeated discussion and repeated comparison by the masses, and after continuous discussion for forty nights, gradually reached a common conclusion.

    After the discussion on profit distribution methods, joining the cooperative methods, and cadre issues was completed, the farmers were announced: "Joining the cooperative is voluntary, those who agree to join the cooperative will sign their names as proof, and those who do not agree to join the cooperative will not sign their names." As a result, in three days, all the farmers in the village, except for a few, signed their names to join the cooperative. The branch committee also asked the farmers to discuss it carefully with their families, and strive to achieve "self-understanding, family-understanding, and everyone-understanding". After full deliberation and discussion, out of the 417 households in the village, 401 households joined the cooperative. The large cooperative was established.

      Overcoming Obstacles in the Progress of the Large Cooperative

    After the establishment of the large cooperative, production teams were formed based on the principle of convenient work and based on the original groups and cooperatives, and land and livestock were allocated according to the labor force of the production team. Since the start of production in the spring of 1953, new problems have been encountered continuously. There was no unified quota management in the cooperative in terms of labor and finance, and everyone watched each other when producing, and even deliberately slacked off, forming a serious phenomenon of wasting time. The cooperative management committee researched and discussed this situation and formulated a method of "determining work by output" according to crops and soil quality. The contract work method was promoted in each team and production group, and the number of workdays was determined based on the annual yield of land crops. As soon as this method was implemented, the phenomenon of wasting time was immediately reduced, because this method naturally rewarded labor: good cultivation required less labor, and more grain was harvested, so more work points were earned and more grain was distributed; if the cultivation was not good and there was more wasted time and less grain was harvested, then naturally less work points were earned and less grain was distributed.

    In the cooperative's expenses, it was also relatively chaotic and wasteful at first. If one team received a whip, other teams would see it, and even if they had whips to use, they would come to the cooperative to receive one; if one team received a plowshare, other teams would want it even if they had one. Expenses of this kind were all compared, and a little less was not acceptable. In this way, on the one hand, the cooperative's expenses were huge, and on the other hand, some items were stored in each team and not used. Some people also did not cherish the livestock, only caring about using them, not feeding them well, and soon a cow and two horses died. At this time, after research by the cooperative affairs committee, a method of "unified financial management contract system" was formulated. Livestock and furniture were used by the team, and the value of fattening was "increased," and the amount of increased value belonged to the team, and the amount of "decreased value" was borne by the team for compensation; if the livestock died, in order to take care of the team's difficulties, the team and the cooperative each bore one-half. In this way, everyone cherished the livestock. Unified quotas were also formulated based on the general situation for the purchase and repair of farm tools and livestock feed, as well as the oil for lighting and the paper for recording workdays in each team, and the teams were responsible for adding anything that was not enough, and the remaining amount belonged to the team. The chaotic phenomenon in expenses was stopped from then on.

      Consolidating the Organization of the Cooperative Through Rectification

    After spring plowing and sowing, a small number of members who were not firm enough when joining the cooperative, seeing the temporary phenomenon of wasting time that appeared after the establishment of the large cooperative, were afraid that they would suffer losses in the cooperative and had the idea of withdrawing from the cooperative, and their production enthusiasm was not high. When the Party's higher-level organization saw this situation, it decided to help the cooperative carry out rectification.

    As a result of the rectification, the number of households in the cooperative was reduced from 401 to 287, and the cooperative was more consolidated than before. At the same time, the higher-level people's government, based on the extent of the drought in 1952, transported more than 20,000 catties of grain and provided relief and loans to the members according to the degree of disaster, which further encouraged the members' production enthusiasm.

    During the rectification, there was an idea of wanting to divide the large cooperative into small cooperatives. The members of Geng Changsuo's original cooperative, seeing that many less affluent farmers had entered after the establishment of the large cooperative, the livestock and farm tools were weak, and there was no public property; when the livestock were uniformly allocated, the eight large mules and horses from the original cooperative were also divided into each team; when the farming area was allocated, they were only allocated some sandy land, and the land that they had fertilized was allocated to other teams; especially after the establishment of the large cooperative, the production investment was very large, and the cooperative strictly controlled the members' withdrawal of deposits, and even pocket money felt very tight. This made some old members feel that the large cooperative was not as good as the small cooperative. They sometimes even raised opinions to Geng Changsuo in person, but Geng Changsuo believed that the development from a small cooperative to a large cooperative was a step forward and should never be retreated. He said to the old members: "It is easier for me and everyone to run a small cooperative. We have been running this small cooperative for so many years, and we will be able to do a good job in production without much effort, and I will personally save a lot of effort. Moreover, our old cooperative has a large family fortune, several large livestock and several large carts, as well as oil mills, rope making, and other sideline industries, which will surely produce more grain and increase income, which is beneficial to you and me. But we must never do this, we cannot only care about our prosperity and leave others to suffer. The difficulties of the large cooperative are only temporary, and it will be more prosperous than the small cooperative in one or two years. Moreover, if we always run small cooperatives, we will never reach socialism." Through Geng Changsuo's constant explanations to them, he cleared the minds of the old members. The old members were even more enthusiastic and were still the banner of the thirteen production teams in the entire cooperative in the subsequent production, leading the entire cooperative forward.

      The Large Cooperative Demonstrated Superiority in Production

    In the year of operating the large cooperative, the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative took a tortuous and complex road. But one year of experience has proved that the large cooperative is not only much superior to individual households and mutual aid teams, but also superior to small cooperatives.

    The superiority of this large cooperative is first manifested in its powerful productive forces. The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative now has 93 livestock, exceeding the total number of livestock in the village before the "July 7th" Incident. In addition to large carts and general farm tools, there are also more than 20 new-style walking plows and three horse-drawn two-bottom plows and horse-drawn twelve-bottom disc harrows. The entire cooperative has 58 wells, as well as large-scale oil extraction, rope making, pig raising (176 pigs), carpentry workshops, and other diverse sideline production. On this basis, coupled with the rational organization of labor, it is at the forefront of all production work. For example, in the autumn of 1953, there were continuous heavy rains for more than 40 days. After the heavy rains stopped, it was necessary to urgently harvest the crops and seize the time to cultivate the land and sow wheat. Under such circumstances, all thirteen production teams in the cooperative were engaged in intense harvesting. Some people were in charge of cutting grain, and some people were in charge of sending manure to the cultivated land after cutting. Due to insufficient animal power, some teams also drew more than a dozen people to pull the drill and sow seeds. After 25 days of intense labor, the millet and sorghum were harvested on time; all the land for wheat sowing was sown in time, and the work efficiency was stronger than the average mutual aid team. For example, in the spring of 1953, the entire cooperative drew more than 40 strong laborers and opened a well-digging training class themselves, learning well-digging and cone-drilling techniques, and formed their own well-digging team and cone-drilling team, implementing the "contracting for well-digging" method. In the past, it took 84 people to dig a well, but now it takes 30 people to complete it. The entire cooperative dug a total of 17 wells, saving 918 laborers and saving more than 13 million yuan in expenses.

      Members' Lives Gradually Improve

    With the development of production, the lives of the members of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative have improved year by year. Old members Lu Molin, Li Huiting, and Li Di'er were all poor farmers in the past. They could not afford cotton pants in winter, and a family of several people shared a quilt. They could not afford dumplings for the New Year, and in the spring, they relied on twisting rope and doing odd jobs to earn some money to buy some red grain mixed with bran and vegetables to get through the spring famine. Li Di'er even begged for food in 1944. But after they were organized, their lives quickly reached the point where they could not finish eating or using, and they also had surplus to invest in production.

    By 1949, their annual income was enough for three years. Therefore, in addition to food and clothing, the houses they lived in gradually improved. Many members built new houses that were both strong and beautiful with "uniform" new bricks.

      The lives of the new members who joined the cooperative in 1952 have also changed significantly. New member Li Yutian joined the cooperative in 1952, and the grain he received in 1953 was enough for two years. He has already prepared the wood for building a house and more than 6,000 bricks, and plans to buy some more bricks to build a house after the bumper harvest in 1954.

    After being organized, thanks to mutual help, the members completely avoided the fate of bankruptcy in the face of natural disasters and misfortunes. Member Li Di'er was injured in the foot by a big cart when he went to Bozhen to Anguo for transportation in 1947. He was treated for nearly a year. In addition to the treatment expenses being borne by the cooperative, he was also given a workday as usual every day, because this was a "work-related injury". Although he did not work for a year, he received dividends as usual after the autumn harvest, just like other members.

    Another example is new member Li Fuhai, a family of four, who used to farm nine mu of land. Because of his strong labor force, his life was prosperous. But his wife suddenly developed sores in 1952. In order to take care of the patient, he could not work in the fields, so he only harvested 300 catties of grain from the nine mu of land. There was no way, so he had to leave his wife with sores and go to Baoding to work as a "small worker". Later, he heard that the village had formed a large cooperative, so he returned from Baoding to join the large cooperative. In the work of 1953, the cooperative took special care of him, allowing him to work on the edge of the village so that he could go home at any time to take care of his wife. The cooperative also sent his wife to Baoding for treatment by car. Some members also often went to his home to help cook. For the whole year, he only earned more than 40 workdays, but he also received 400 catties of grain, 400 catties of sweet potatoes, and some peanuts and cabbage. Although life was a little difficult, he avoided the fate of bankruptcy.

    With the affluence of the members' lives, their cultural life has also gradually improved. The thirteen production teams now subscribe to publications such as "Rural Propagandist", "Propagandist Manual", and "North China People". The cooperative also has People's Daily, Hebei Daily, China Youth Daily, and Hebei Youth Daily. In addition to production, each production team is like a learning unit, regularly reading newspapers and studying and discussing articles in newspapers and periodicals. 86% of school-age children have entered primary school, and some have been promoted to higher primary schools in nearby villages, and the children of six members have been promoted to middle schools in the county or province. After the establishment of the large cooperative in 1952, the cooperative organized a health station including two doctors, one pharmacist, and one accountant. In addition to the cooperative taking out most of the medicine expenses, the government also subsidized a part. This not-so-large health station has played a great role in the health of the members, especially in maternal and child health care.

      The Lonely, Elderly, and Weak Receive Help

    In addition, the cooperative is easy to lead the lonely, elderly, weak, and disabled households to carry out production and overcome difficulties. At present, among the 287 households in the entire cooperative, 25% are lonely, elderly, weak, and disabled households. If they do not participate in the cooperative, their lives will be extremely difficult. Because the cooperative has a larger labor force and economic strength, it is not a problem to cultivate the land of these households and process and fertilize it. This is the best kind of social labor mutual assistance.

    For example, Li Tanzi and Li Xiuying, who joined the cooperative in 1948, were both orphans of twelve or thirteen years old when they joined the cooperative. The cooperative took them in, and their land was fertilized and processed by the cooperative as usual, and the yield increased as much as other people's land. In 1950, one family received 2,964 catties of grain, and the other family received 1,554 catties of grain, which was more than enough to eat and wear. The cooperative also took care of them like their own children, buying them cloth and cotton when it was time to wear cotton clothes; giving them pocket money to buy oil and salt when they ran out; and having someone to take care of them when they were sick. They grew up in such a warm family, just like children with parents.

      The Production Cooperative Drove the Mutual Aid Teams

    Under the influence of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the whole village gradually developed. In 1948, there were three cooperatives and six teams in the village, with a total of 53 households, accounting for just over 12% of the total number of households. By the first half of 1953, there were 401 households, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of households. The farmers in other mutual aid teams and cooperatives, like the members of the Geng Changsuo Cooperative, also increased production. In the past five years, there has been no differentiation within the farmers, and on the basis of mutual aid and cooperation, the production tools and land quality have been further improved than when the land reform was completed. This is the result of the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

      The Leading Role of the Party

    Over the past ten years, the development and growth of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative has been inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party. The Party has repeatedly educated the members on "getting organized", improving the members' ideological awareness and uniting the farmers. These are the basic conditions for the development of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative.

    The Party's leading role in the Geng Changsuo Cooperative is particularly manifested in solving some key issues. The Party organization demonstrated timely and correct leadership, enabling these issues to be properly resolved. For example, when Li Huiting bought four mu of land at a high price of 6,000 catties of wheat in 1950, it stimulated some members' ideas of buying land and developing capitalism. After understanding the situation, Geng Changsuo convened all Party members in the cooperative, including Qiao Wanxiang and Li Yantian, and explained that it was not in line with the Party's principles for him to buy land to get rich and make others bankrupt and suffer, and that Party members should not have the idea of buying land and developing into rich peasants, nor was it the path that cooperative members should take. Party members should educate the members and overcome this idea. The Party members' thinking was unified. At the meeting of all members, Geng Changsuo said: "We have divided the land, and then we go to buy land and develop into rich peasants, making the people who sell the land have difficulties in life. Is it right for us to do this? Actively developing production and increasing production is our policy." In this way, the members' enthusiasm for investing in land processing was improved, and spontaneous capitalist ideas were gradually overcome.

    In order to lead the masses to take the socialist road, the Party organization overcame the members' reluctance to absorb new members and the conservative idea of wanting to divide into small cooperatives after the establishment of the large cooperative. The Party organization conducted socialist prospect education for the members through all Party members, guiding the members' conservative ideas and the ideas of only caring about personal interests to collectivist ideas, and let them look forward to the beautiful prospects of socialism.

    The Party organization often educates the members to unite with the farmers outside the cooperative, so that they can realize the benefits of being organized and join the agricultural production cooperative. Although the lazy Li Zengxian's land was all good land, the harvest was lower than others. In 1952, when there was a drought, it was clear that there would be no harvest of five mu of millet. The members took water from a well more than a mile away and helped him water for two days and two nights, so that five mu of millet harvested more than 700 catties. Zhang Seng had no livestock to cultivate the land and could not sow wheat, so the members helped him cultivate the land and sow wheat. Others such as Li Keyi, Li Kedong, and Qiao Xiuyun were also lacking manpower and animal power, and the cooperative helped them with manpower and animal power to cultivate, sow, and harvest, thus moving these households to join the cooperative.

    Before the establishment of the large cooperative, in order to promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the whole village, Geng Changsuo Cooperative absorbed the cadres of other small cooperatives to attend the meeting so that they could learn from experience and run the cooperative well. Wang Guangyin often had problems when they organized the cooperative because they had no experience. In addition to absorbing him to attend the meeting, Geng Changsuo also helped him solve specific problems and promoted the consolidation and development of their cooperative.

      Beautiful Prospects

    The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative is like a flower, radiating brilliance on the plains of Hebei. When the state put forward the general line for the transition period and carried out the socialist transformation of agriculture, the members of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative studied and discussed and planned to gradually absorb all the farmers in the village to participate in the cooperative within about five years on the basis of the current 287 households. Within this time, strive to increase the average yield per mu from the original 250 catties to 500 or 600 catties. They strive to turn all the land into paddy fields, dig 78 wells and gradually install pumps. The amount of fertilization and cultivation techniques will be greatly improved, and excellent varieties will be fully promoted.

    At that time, Wugong Village will change its appearance: on the land of the whole village, there will be a fairly long shelterbelt, and under the poplar belt, Amorpha fruticosa will be planted; in the 500 mu of sandy wasteland, most of the peaches, apricots, pears, apples and other trees will be planted, and a large orchard will appear. In the village, there will also be relatively suitable houses for raising livestock and domestic animals, and livestock and domestic animals will become excellent varieties.

    With the improvement of production, people's lives will gradually change. People will have public entertainment places, and the health of adults and children will be better protected.

    There is no doubt that under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and under the shining light of the general line and general tasks, they will certainly be able to create greater achievements with greater efforts and realize their beautiful hopes.

    组织起来十周年
    ——记耿长锁农业生产合作社的发展经过
    陈洁民　肖峰　志清
    一九五三年十二月，是河北省饶阳县五公村耿长锁农业生产合作社组织起来的十周年。
    这个生产合作社十年的历史，说明“组织起来”是农民走向富裕的道路。十年的经历是曲折的，它克服了很多困难后终于由一九四四年的四户发展到去年的二百八十七户。它像一粒花的种籽，经过播种、发芽，终于开出了美丽的花朵；它像飘扬在河北平原上的一面旗帜，召唤着全省农民走社会主义的光明大道。
      开始建立“土地合作组”
    一九四三年，冀中革命根据地的人民，处在日寇大“扫荡”和大旱灾后的极端困难情况中。党在当时号召农民组织起来发展生产。五公村党员乔万象等响应党的号召，用政府贷给的二百斤红粮开始合作搞副业生产。一九四四年春耕开始时，又在这个基础上实行土地合作，劳力土地对半分红，建立“土地合作组”。耿长锁也在这个时候参加了合作组。
    这一年组里遇到不少困难，生产吧，没有牲口，又没有农具；生活呢，没有粮食，敌人还不断出来抢掠。他们只好白天每人使一张大镐刨地，夜间回来在一起打麻绳，把打出的麻绳卖出去赚点钱，买回粮食，搀上糠菜吃。这样，才勉强播上了种。
    这一年虽然经历了许多困难，但严重的灾荒，总算渡了过去，合作组的产量达到每亩平均二百二十斤，比一般农民多打五十多斤。
      成立生产合作社
    “土地合作组”在一九四四年显示的优越性，向本村农民说明了“组织起来”是走向富裕的道路，有十三户又要求入了组。为了奖励劳动，组内规定地四劳六分红。当时选举耿秀峰为主任，耿长锁为副业组长，张近仁为农业组长。不久，耿秀峰脱离生产参加工作，大家就选耿长锁为主任。
    这一年土地较多、劳力较少的户，觉得自己土地分得少，干起活来不起劲；有的人在参加组时就有取巧占便宜的思想，组内对他们曾不断进行了教育。虽然这样，到一九四五年冬天，终于有八户退出去了。这时土地合作组只剩下九户。以后组里采取了稳步前进的方针，每年吸收二、三户，到一九五一年，达到了十九户。
    从一九五零年起，土地合作组改为农业生产合作社，生产逐年提高。一九四四年每亩产量平均只二百二十斤，到一九五零年每亩平均产量就达到四百七十斤，一九五一年达到了四百八十七斤，已超过战前生产水平的百分之一百三十一点八，比当地单干农民提高一倍，副业生产也较大规模地开展起来。从一九五一年合作社就改为地五劳五分红了。
    在组织起来的几年中，经过减租查租，土地改革，大部分社员都分得了土地，社员的生产积极性大大提高；加上政府的大力支持，土地的产量提高了，社员的生活也逐步得到改善，不但全部够吃够用，还能在合作社进行投资。大家看到了农业生产合作社的好处，在一九五一年又有六户农民入了社。
      在渡荒中发挥了优越性
    一九五二年，这是耿长锁农业生产合作社遭受旱灾、虫灾最严重的一年。在灾荒面前，它经历了又一次严重的考验。
    这年从麦收前下了一场雨后，一直到秋收完毕没有下一场透雨，虫害也很严重，特别以红蜘蛛为最多。棉花的叶子枯萎了，有的落下来；花生上、豆子上、高粱上、甚至树上都是红糊糊的一层，农民们说：“完了，等着饿死吧！”
    耿长锁农业生产合作社的社员们，没有在严重的灾荒面前惊慌失措，在党的分支部领导下（该社从一九五二年建立了党和团的分支委员会），讨论了如何战胜灾害的办法，决定全社一齐下手，向旱灾、虫灾斗争。每个生产小组，都展开了“保年景”的劳动竞赛。
    新打的一眼井上，牲口日夜不停地拉着水车，用井水浇地。离井远的地高，水流不过去，就用“打帮斗”的办法浇。水浇不到的十三亩棉花，就组织了挑水组连续浇了三遍。
    灭虫组的妇女们，在青年团分支部书记耿素娟带领下，分为两组，日夜不停地喷杀红蜘蛛，白天喷棉花，晚上喷花生。连续喷射了三十天，喷射了三万斤药水，终于保住了棉花和花生的收成。
    男女社员们几个月的辛勤劳动，得到了应得的报偿。这年平均每亩棉花的产量是二百四十斤，丰产地的棉花每亩达三百七十斤，而社外户每亩棉花只收四十斤；社内的谷子平均每亩二百一十斤，社外户只一百斤上下，社内与社外单位面积产量的比较相差很多。
    耿长锁农业生产合作社向灾害斗争取得胜利的事实，再一次教育了农民：只有组织起来才能战胜灾荒，才能摆脱穷困，走向富裕生活。从此，全村互助合作运动大大发展起来，原来全村只有四个小型农业生产合作社，秋收后一下子就发展成了二十个，互助组也发展到十二个。全村组织起来的户数，达到了全村户数的百分之八十一。
      由小社办成大社
    一九五二年秋收后，五公村的农业生产合作社、互助组多了，需要该村党支部委员会进一步加强领导。但全支部十一个支部委员，差不多每个人都领导着一个社或一个组，支部委员的大部分精力和时间，都用在领导本社、本组的工作上，对全村的工作很少考虑。这样，上级要求村支部完成的紧急工作，就往往由于支部委员们为本社、本组的工作拖着而完成不了。同时，社多了问题也就多了，许多问题不能及时解决；也有一些工作，由于缺乏领导，又发生盲目乱干的现象。如在防旱时，大家都紧张打井，但都从自己本社、本组着眼，村东能够打井，所有的社、组就都在村东打起来，不管自己在村东有多少地也要打一眼；村南没有人在那里打过井，就谁也不愿意在那里尝试，怕花很多钱打不成。所以形成村东的井“挤疙瘩”，村南一眼也没有。
    这时，耿长锁从苏联参观回来，生动具体地把苏联农民的生产情况和生活情形向全村农民作了报告。报告像强大的磁石一样，吸引着全村农民，他们羡慕苏联的集体农民，觉得小社小组耕作仍然受限制，不能充分发挥生产潜力，因此他们迫切地要求合并成为大社。
    办大社的时机已经成熟了。支部委员会首先领导全体党员进行讨论，统一党的工作和全体党员的行动，解决现在互助合作中所发生的问题。讨论结果，一致同意耿长锁农业生产合作社和其他社、组合并为一个大社。支部又通过各社、组中的党员，以社、组为单位发动群众进行讨论。农民们早就清楚地看到耿长锁农业生产合作社社员们的富裕生活，非常愿意合并成一个大社。
    接着，支部委员会领导大家讨论组社的原则问题——分红、入社办法（包括牲口、农具怎样入社）和干部问题。有些农民在讨论这些问题时，单从个人眼前利益出发发表意见，很难达到完全统一。如对分红问题，土地多的主张土地多分红，劳力多的主张劳力多分红；有水车的把水车价估高，没水车的把水车价估低。支部委员会采取让群众反复讨论、反复对比的方法，连续讨论了四十个晚上，才逐渐得出了共同的结论。
    分红办法、入社办法、干部问题讨论结束以后，就对农民宣布：“入社是自觉自愿，同意入社的以签名为证，不同意入社的不签名。”结果在三天的时间里，全村农民除少数人以外，都签名入社。支部委员会又让农民自己和家庭好好商量，务必达到“自己通，全家通，大伙通”。充分酝酿讨论之后，全村四百一十七户中，有四百零一户入了社。大社成立起来了。
      克服大社前进中的障碍
    大社成立以后，根据作活方便和以原来各组、社为基础的原则编成了生产队，根据生产队的劳力分配了土地和牲口。一九五三年春天开始生产以来，又连续碰到了新的问题。社内在劳力和财务上没有统一的定额管理，大家生产起来互相观望，甚至有的故意撒懒，形成严重的窝工现象。社管理委员会对这种情况进行了研究讨论，按作物、土质定出“以产订工”办法，各队和生产小组推行了包工办法，根据土地作物的常年产量订出工数。这个办法一实行，窝工现象马上减少，因为这个办法自然地奖励了劳动：耕作好用工少，多打了粮食，就多挣工分，多分粮食；如果不好好耕作，窝工多，打粮少，就自然挣工分少，少分粮。
    在社内开支上，起初也是比较混乱和浪费的。这一队领了一把鞭子，别的队看到了，虽然有鞭子使，也来社里领；这一个队领了一个犁铧子，别的队有，也来要。诸如此类的开支，都是比着看，少一点也不行。这样，一方面造成社内开支庞大，另
  一方面各队有些物品却存着不用。有的对牲口也不爱护，光管使，喂的不好，不久就死了一头牛和两匹马。这时，经社务委员会研究，又制订了“财务统
  一管理包干制”的办法，牲口家具归队使用，喂肥了“增值”，增值数目归队所有，“减值”数目归队负担赔偿；如果牲口死了，为了照顾队的困难，队和社各负担二分之一。这样，谁也爱惜牲口了。对置买和修理农具以及牲口草料，各队点灯用油、记工用纸，也都根据一般情况，一一制订统一定额，不够的自己负责增添，剩余的归队所有。开支上的混乱现象从此被制止了。
      经过整顿，巩固了社的组织
    春耕播种以后，有少数在入社时不够坚定的社员，见到大社成立后出现的一时窝工现象，恐怕自己在社内吃亏，产生了退社思想，生产情绪不高。党的上级组织见到这种情况，就决定帮助该社进行整顿。
    整顿的结果，全社从四百零一户减到二百八十七户，社比以前更加巩固了。与此同时，上级人民政府根据一九五二年旱灾的程度，运来两万多斤粮食，分别受灾情况进行赈济和借给社员，更加鼓舞了社员的生产情绪。
    在整顿中曾出现了一种愿把大社划为小社的思想。耿长锁原来社的社员们，见到大社成立后进来了许多不富裕的农民，牲口、农具都弱，而且没有公共财产；统一调配牲口时，把原来社里的八匹大骡、马也分到各队去了；分配耕作区时，净分了些沙土地，自己种肥了的土地分给别队了；特别是成立大社以后生产投资很大，社内严格控制社员支取存款，零用钱也感到很紧。这就使一些老社员觉得大社不如小社好。他们有时还当面向耿长锁提出意见，但耿长锁认为由小社发展到大社是向前迈进了一步，绝不能向后退。他对老社员们说：“办小社对我对大家都容易，咱这小社办了这些年，不用费劲生产就会搞好，我个人也省心劲。再说，咱老社家底大，几个大牲口和几辆大车，还有油坊、打绳等副业，一定会多打粮食，会多增加收入，对你们有利，对我也有利。但是绝对不能这样办，不能光管咱们富裕，扔下别人遭难，大社的困难只是暂时的，一、二年后比小社还会富裕。再说，老是办小社，永远也到不了社会主义。”经过耿长锁对他们不断的解释，打通了老社员的思想。老社员们情绪更高了，在以后的生产中，仍然是全社十三个生产队中的旗帜，带动着全社前进。
      大社在生产中表现了优越性
    在经营大社的一年中，耿长锁农业生产合作社走着曲折复杂的道路。但是一年的经验证明，大社不但比单干户、互助组优越得多，而且比小社也优越。
    这个大社的优越性，首先表现在生产力的强大上。耿长锁农业生产合作社现在有牲口九十三头，超过全村“七七”事变前的牲口总数。除有大车和 一般农具外，还有新式步犁二十多张，马拉二铧犁、马拉十二铧圆盘耙共三架。全社有水井五十八眼，还有较大规模的打油、打绳、养猪（一百七十六口）、木作坊等多样的副业生产。在这个基础上，再加上合理组织劳动，因此一切生产工作，它都走在前面。例如一九五三年秋连续下了四十多天大雨，等到大雨停止以后，既要紧急收割庄稼，又要抓紧耕地种麦。在这样的情况下，全社十三个生产队，都投入紧张的收割中，有的人专管割谷，有的人专管在割完的地里送粪耕地，由于畜力不足，有的队还抽出十几个人拉耧播种。紧张地劳动了二十五天，谷子、高粱都按时收割了；所有种麦的土地都及时播种了麦子，工作效率比一般互助组强。又如一九五三年春天，全社抽出四十多个强的劳动力，自己开办了打井训练班，学习了打井、锥井技术，组成了自己的打井班和锥井班，施行了“打井包干”办法，过去每打一眼井必须八十四个人，现在三十个人就打成了。全社共打井十七眼，节省劳力九百一十八个，节省开支一千三百多万元。
      社员的生活逐步提高
    随着生产的发展，耿长锁农业生产合作社社员的生活逐年提高。老社员卢墨林、李辉廷、李第二过去都是贫农，冬天穿不上棉裤，一家子几口人伙盖一条棉被，过年吃不上饺子，一入春就靠自己打绳、打短工挣点钱，买点红粮搀上糠菜才能渡过春荒。李第二在一九四四年还讨过饭。但他们在组织起来以后，生活很快达到吃不清用不了，并且还有剩余投入生产。
    到一九四九年，他们一年的收入可以够三年吃。因此他们除了吃穿以外，住的房子也逐渐改观。不少社员都是用“青一色”的新砖，盖起了又结实又好看的新房。
      一九五二年入社的新社员，生活也有了显著变化。新社员李玉田一九五二年入社，一九五三年分的粮食就够吃二年的，他已经准备了盖房的木料和六千多块砖，准备一九五四年丰收后，再买点砖盖房。
    组织起来后，由于互相帮助，社员们完全避免了在天灾人祸面前破产的命运。社员李第二在一九四七年从泊镇到安国搞运输时，不谨慎被大车轧伤了脚，养了将近一年多，除了治疗用费由社负担外，还每天照常记一个工，因为这是“因公致疾”。
  一年的时间他虽然没有劳动，秋收后照常和其他社员一样分红。
    又如新社员李福海四口人，以前种着九亩地，由于劳力强，生活是富裕的。但他媳妇突于一九五二年生起疮来，他为了照顾病人，不能到田里劳作，所以九亩地只打了三百斤粮食，没办法，只得扔下长疮的媳妇到保定作“小工”。后来，他听到村里组成大社，才从保定回来参加了大社。在一九五三年的劳作中，社内特别照顾他，让他在村边上作活，随时可以回家来照顾媳妇，社内还用车送他媳妇到保定治病。有的社员还经常到他家中帮助做饭。整整的一年，他才挣了四十多个工，但他还分了四百斤粮食，四百斤山芋，还有一部分花生和白菜，虽然生活有些困难，但避免了破产的命运。
    随着社员生活的富裕，文化生活也逐渐提高。现在十三个生产队都订着“农村宣传员”、“宣传员手册”、“华北人民”等刊物，社内还有人民日报、河北日报、中国青年报、河北青年报。各个生产队除了生产外，就像是一个学习单位，经常读报和学习讨论报刊上的文章。百分之八十六的学龄儿童已进了小学，还有一部分升入附近村的高小，有六个社员的子弟升入本县或省立的中学。一九五二年成立大社以后，社内组织了包括两名医生、一名司药、一名会计的保健站，除了社内拿出大部药费外，政府还补助了一部。这个规模不大的保健站，对于社员们的身体健康，特别是对妇婴保健方面，起了很大作用。
      孤寡老弱得到帮助
    另外，合作社容易带动孤寡、老弱、残废户进行生产，克服困难。现在全社二百八十七户中，有百分之二十五的孤寡残废户，如果他们不参加社，他们的生活就极端困难。合作社由于劳力和经济力量较大，耕种这些户的土地和加工施肥就不成问题，这是一种最好的社会劳动互助。
    如一九四八年入社的李昙子和李秀英，入社时都是十二、三岁的孤儿，合作社收留了他们，他们的土地由合作社照常施肥、加工，产量和别人的土地一样提高。在一九五零年，他们一家分了二千九百六十四斤粮食，一家分了一千五百五十四斤粮食，除了吃穿还有富裕。社内还像对自己的孩子一样照顾他们，该穿棉衣了，就给他们买布买棉花；没有油盐了，就给他们零钱买；病了有人照顾。他们在这样一个温暖的大家庭里，和有父母的孩子一样长大起来。
      生产合作社带动了互助组
    在耿长锁农业生产合作社的影响下，全村的互助合作运动逐渐发展起来。一九四八年全村有三个社六个组，共五十三户，占总户数的百分之十二强，到一九五三年上半年，即达四百零一户，占总户数的百分之九十多。其他互助组、合作社的农民和耿长锁社一样，也提高了生产。五年来农民内部不但没有什么分化，而且在互助合作的基础上，生产工具、土地质量等都比土地改革完成时更加提高了。这就是互助合作运动发展的结果。
      党的领导作用
    十年来，耿长锁农业生产合作社的发展壮大，是和共产党的领导分不开的。党反复地对社员进行了“组织起来”的教育，提高社员的思想觉悟，团结了农民。这些都是耿长锁农业生产合作社发展的基本条件。
    党对耿长锁社的领导作用，特别表现在解决一些关键问题上。党组织表现出了及时的正确的领导，使这些问题得到妥善的解决。例如当一九五零年李辉廷以六千斤麦子的高价买了四亩地时，刺激了一些社员们买地发展资本主义的思想。耿长锁在了解了这种情况后，就召集社内乔万象、李砚田等全体党员，说明自己买地发财让别人破产受罪是不合乎党的原则的，党员不应有买地向富农发展的思想，也不是合作社社员应当走的道路，党员应该在社员中进行教育，克服这种思想。党员的思想统一了，在全体社员会上，耿长锁说：“我们分了地，又去买地向富农发展，让卖地的人生活困难，我们这样办对头吗？积极发展生产，提高产量，才是我们的方针。”这样，社员们对土地加工投资的积极性提高了，自发的资本主义思想被逐步克服了。
    为了带动群众走社会主义的道路，党组织克服了社员中不愿吸收新社员的思想，和建立大社以后又想划为小社的保守思想。党组织通过全体党员对社员进行社会主义前途教育，把农民的保守思想和只顾个人利益的思想引导向集体主义的思想，让他们瞻望到社会主义的美丽远景。
    党组织经常教育社员要团结社外农民，让他们认识到组织起来的好处，参加到农业生产合作社中来。懒汉李增贤虽然净是好地，但收成比别人都低，在一九五二年天旱时，眼看五亩地的谷子就没收成了，社员们从一里地以外的井里取水，帮助他浇了两天两夜，才使五亩谷子打了七百多斤。张僧没有牲口耕地，耩不上麦子，社员就帮助他耕地耩麦子。其他像李可义、李克东、乔秀云等人也是缺乏人力、畜力，社内都用人力、畜力帮他们耕耩收割，因此感动了这些户都入了社。
    在没有成立大社以前，为了推动全村的互助合作运动，耿长锁社开会时就吸收其他几个小社的干部列席参加，以便他们吸取经验，把合作社办好。王广印他们才组织社时，因为没有经验，常发生问题，耿长锁除吸收他列席参加会议外，还帮助他解决具体问题，促进他们社的巩固发展。
      美丽的远景
    耿长锁农业生产合作社像一朵花，在河北平原上放射着光彩。当国家在过渡时期的总路线提出对农业实行社会主义改造时，耿长锁农业生产合作社的社员们进行了学习和讨论，计划着大约在五年内，在现在二百八十七户的基础上，逐步吸收全村农民都参加到合作社内来。在这个时间内，争取每亩土地的平均产量，由原来的二百五十斤提高到五、六百斤。他们争取把全部土地变成水田，打七十八眼井并逐渐安上抽水机。施肥的数量和耕作技术，将会大大提高，优良品种将会完全推广。
    那时，五公村将会改变面貌：在全村的土地上，出现相当长的防护林带，而且在白杨林带的下面，种上紫穗槐；在五百亩沙荒地里，将大部栽植上桃、杏、梨、苹果等树，一个大的果木园将会出现。在村子里，还会出现比较合适的饲养牲口、家畜的房舍，牲口、家畜将会变成优良品种。
    随着生产的提高，人们的生活也将逐步改变，人们将会有公共娱乐的场所，大人孩子的健康会得到更好的保护。
    毫无疑问，在党和人民政府的领导下，在总路线总任务的光辉照耀下，他们一定能以更大的努力，创造更大的成绩，实现自己美好的希望。
