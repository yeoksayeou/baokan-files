Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 14th: TASS Washington, January 14th: Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations on January 12th, in which he attempted to defend American foreign policy since the Eisenhower administration took office.

Dulles admitted at the beginning that America's "speed of military construction has brought huge budget deficits, increasing currency depreciation, and frenzied economy." Later, he shamelessly claimed that these "emergency measures" were taken because of external "dangers."

Dulles said, "Our total expenditure on security work at home and abroad amounts to more than 50 billion US dollars each year, resulting in a deficit of 9 billion US dollars in the 1953 budget, and a deficit of 11 billion US dollars in 1954. These deficits are occurring under tax rates equivalent to wartime tax rates, and the actual value of the US dollar is constantly declining."

Speaking of the United States' policy toward Asia, Dulles reiterated that the United States intends to "maintain its position on Okinawa" and station American armed forces, including "highly mobile sea, air, and amphibious forces," in the Far East. He boasted of the United States' interference in the Indochina War, saying that the United States has contributed greatly to this war.

Dulles essentially admitted that the so-called "European Defense Community" that the US government forced European countries to accept had not been successful. He said that the Defense Community Treaty was signed in May 1952, "but when the Eisenhower administration took office last January, no government had ratified this treaty in parliament, and therefore the plan was close to death." Dulles said that now, President Eisenhower "is constantly showing how much the United States values the completion of the European Defense Community, and we hope that there will be a political group to be completed later."

Dulles admitted that the goal of the European Defense Community had not been achieved and expressed regret over the "enormous difficulties on the road to the final realization of Franco-German unity."

The Secretary of State wanted to portray the military measures implemented in the United States as measures conducive to "defending freedom." Overall, there was no hint in the US Secretary of State's speech that American policy intends to embark on the road to easing international tensions.

    杜勒斯厚着脸皮为美国侵略政策辩护
    他的演说表明美国不愿走上缓和国际局势的道路
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十四日讯：一月十二日，国务卿杜勒斯在外交学会发表演说，他在演说中企图为美国自艾森豪威尔政府就职以来的外交政策辩护。
    杜勒斯在开始的时候承认美国的“军事建设速度带来了巨大的预算赤字、通货的日益贬值和热狂的经济”，后来他又厚着脸皮说什么所以采取这些“紧急措施”是因为有外来的“危险”。
    杜勒斯说，“我们在国内外的安全工作经费总额每年达五百多亿美元，结果在一九五三年的预算中的赤字达九十亿美元，一九五四年的赤字将达一百一十亿美元。这些赤字是在税额相当于战时税额的情况下发生的，美元的实际价值在不断下跌。”
    谈到美国对亚洲的政策，杜勒斯重申美国有意“保持它在冲绳岛上的地位”，并在远东驻扎包括“高度机动性的海、空与水陆两栖部队”的美国武装部队。他吹嘘美国对印度支那战争的干涉，他说美国对这个战争出力很大。
    杜勒斯在实质上承认美国政府强要欧洲国家接受的所谓“欧洲防务集团”的企图没有得到成功。他说，防务集团条约是一九五二年五月签订的，“可是在去年一月艾森豪威尔政府就职时，还没有那一个政府使议会批准这一条约，因而这个计划接近了死亡。”杜勒斯说，现在，艾森豪威尔总统“不断在表明美国是多么重视欧洲防务集团的完成，我们希望以后还有一个政治集团的完成”。
    杜勒斯承认欧洲防务集团的目标没有达到，并对“法德两国团结的最后实现道路上的巨大困难”表示遗憾。
    国务卿想把在美国所实施的军事措施说成是对“保卫自由”有利的措施。整个说来，美国国务卿的演说中没有任何暗示说明美国的政策有意走上缓和国际紧张局势的道路。
