Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 4th: The first meeting of the Northwest Administrative Committee was held in Xi'an from December 25th to 31st of last year. At the meeting, Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Administrative Committee, made a report on conveying the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, and Vice Chairman Ma Mingfang made a report on the summary of work in the Northwest region in 1953 and the work tasks for 1954. Cheng Bairen, Deputy Head of the Second General Sub-Delegation of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, reported to the meeting on the situation of the慰问visit to Korea.

In summarizing the work of the Northwest region in 1953, Ma Mingfang pointed out: Over the past year, under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups and all strata in the Northwest region have united and cooperated more closely, and industrial and agricultural production has been further improved. The production of state-owned, locally state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative enterprises is expected to complete 103.58 percent of the annual planned total output value by the end of the year, equivalent to 168.41 percent of the actual production performance in 1952. The total grain output of the entire region increased by 8.54 percent compared with 1952. Although the cotton planting area slightly decreased, the output increased by 6.72 percent compared with 1952. In terms of animal husbandry, the number of sheep increased by 17.2 percent compared with 1952, cattle increased by 9.9 percent, horses increased by 6.3 percent, and other livestock such as donkeys and mules also increased.

Regarding the work tasks for 1954, Ma Mingfang pointed out: In terms of industry, the industrial production indicators for the first quarter of 1954 should not be lower than the actual production performance in the fourth quarter of 1953. For capital construction, especially construction projects, the project items and types should be approved as early as possible, and design should begin early. Currently, winter training for employees must be well done. All industrial production and capital construction units should implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing strict economy. In terms of agriculture, people's governments at all levels should list the development of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives as the most important part of rural work. In 1954, the number of households organized in rural areas is required to increase from the current 45 percent to about 55 percent, of which year-round mutual aid teams should account for more than 18 percent, and 700 agricultural production cooperatives should be added. In order to better develop agricultural production, it is also necessary to do a good job in rural supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives, pay attention to leading handicraft production, and closely coordinate with the grain procurement work during this winter and next spring's production. In terms of commerce, state-owned trading institutions and cooperatives must expand the wholesale business of state-owned commerce in a planned and step-by-step manner, and correspondingly develop state-owned retail commerce in cities and industrial and mining areas. This winter and next spring, the supply of materials to rural markets must be well done. In addition, we should continue to strengthen the leadership and transformation of private industry and commerce, and resolutely oppose and stop various illegal activities of some private industrialists and merchants. In terms of transportation, we should complete all the projects of Wushaoling on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway with the greatest enthusiasm and energy, and carry out the construction project of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway from Baoji to the south; and we should strengthen the planning and organization of automobile transportation. In terms of political and legal work, we should mainly do a good job in the general election and economic security work. Cultural and educational work should focus on vigorously running school education, and pay attention to running existing universities and technical schools well.

At the meeting, Yang Mingxuan, Saifuddin, Ma Hongbin, and Huang Zhengqing, vice chairmen of the Northwest Administrative Committee, and all the members, in their speeches, unanimously agreed with and supported the reports of Zhang Zhizhong and Ma Mingfang, and expressed their determination to resolutely implement them. After serious discussion, the meeting unanimously approved the two reports made by Zhang Zhizhong and Ma Mingfang and the resolution on promoting the 1954 national economic construction bonds.
