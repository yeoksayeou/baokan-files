Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 22nd: The "Pravda" published an article by Torkunov entitled "Korean and Chinese Prisoners of War Illegally Handed Over to the U.S. Military Headquarters."

    The Korean Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has handed over 22,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who have failed to exercise their right to repatriation to the U.S. military headquarters. This action seriously violates international agreements, delays the final peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and exacerbates the international situation.
    Torkunov said that it is very telling that some people have welcomed this illegal transfer of prisoners of war, and they are precisely those who are trying to deepen the tension in the Far East.
    It is known to all that the issue of prisoners of war has long been used by American reactionaries to worsen the situation in Korea. Under the pretext of so-called "voluntary repatriation," the U.S. insisted on illegally "screening" prisoners of war, delaying the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement for more than a year. Only because the Korean and Chinese sides put forward a compromise on the time and procedure for the repatriation of prisoners of war was an agreement reached on the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This agreement was based on the principle that prisoners of war must be subjected to explanatory work for a period of ninety days.
    However, what happened later clearly showed that the United Nations Command was implementing a pre-arranged plan to sabotage the explanatory work. Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee's agents were ordered to carry out this plan. They infiltrated the camp guarded by Indian troops and sabotaged the explanatory work by threatening, terrorizing, blackmailing, and intimidating the prisoners of war.
    Torkunov continued: The Korean and Chinese sides have repeatedly asked the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to pay attention to the tragic situation of the prisoners of war. Explanatory work for the prisoners of war was actually only carried out for ten days. Therefore, the Korean and Chinese sides put forward a legitimate demand to make up for the ninety-day explanatory work period. According to the terms of the Armistice Agreement, the issue of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation after the ninety-day explanatory work period will be submitted to a political conference for resolution, and the conference will decide the fate of the prisoners of war within thirty days.
    However, some members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission succumbed to the threat of forcibly "releasing" the prisoners of war, openly violated the Armistice Agreement, and adopted the decision to hand the prisoners of war back to the original detaining party.
    Torkunov finally emphasized that all actions aimed at undermining the armistice and delaying the final peaceful resolution of the Korean issue are contrary to the interests of the forces of peace and hinder the further easing of international tensions.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 23rd: "Red Right Daily" published a commentary on the 22nd entitled "The United States Launches a New Attack on the Korean Armistice Agreement and Threatens World Peace," saying: The U.S. forcibly detaining the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war illegally transferred by the Indian custodial forces not only flagrantly violated the Armistice Agreement stipulating that the explanatory work should be carried out for a full ninety days, but also seriously violated the principles of humanitarianism.
   "Red Right Daily" recounted the unremitting efforts made by the Korean and Chinese sides to justly resolve the prisoner of war issue and peacefully resolve the Korean issue in the past, as well as the obstacles created by the United States on the road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The newspaper wrote: The current malicious actions of the United States cannot but make people doubt whether the United States truly hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. "The purpose of the new provocative actions of the United States on the Korean issue is to exacerbate international tensions, thereby providing an excuse for American billionaires to step up their arms race. Crimes against thousands of unarmed prisoners of war can only be regarded as reflecting the U.S. aggressive intentions. The U.S. wants to use prisoners of war to carry out aggressive adventures in the Far East."
    "Red Right Daily" concluded: This new provocative action once again exposes that American giants are enemies of peace. "It once again clearly illustrates what forces are trying to prevent the easing of world tensions in every possible way."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 22nd: Budapest dispatch: An article published in "Hungarian National News" on the 21st pointed out: Returning the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to the so-called United Nations forces is an illegal act that violates the Armistice Agreement. All the facts prove that the United States, after careful planning, forcibly detains prisoners of war with the aim of making the international situation more tense. World public opinion angrily condemns the US ruling clique's behavior of forcibly detaining prisoners of war to undermine peace and exacerbate international tensions, and firmly demands that a political conference on the Korean issue be held as soon as possible.

    苏、捷、匈等国舆论斥责美方强迫扣留战俘
   【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：“真理报”刊载了托尔库诺夫的一篇文章：题目是“朝中战俘被非法地移交给美军司令部”。
    朝鲜中立国遣返委员会已将二万二千名未能行使其遣返权利的朝中战俘交给美军司令部。这种行为严重地违反了国际协议，使得朝鲜问题的最后和平解决推迟，并使国际局势恶化。
    托尔库诺夫说，已经有人对这种非法移交战俘的行为表示欢迎，而且正就是那些企图加深远东紧张局势的人们，这是很能说明问题的。
    举世皆知，战俘问题很久以来就一直被美国反动分子用来使朝鲜局势恶化。美方在所谓“自愿遣返”的借口下坚持对战俘进行非法“甄别”，而把朝鲜停战协定的签订拖延了一年多。只是由于朝中方面就遣返战俘的时间和程序提出了折衷办法，才获致了关于中立国遣返委员会的职权范围的协议。这个协议是以这样一个原则为基础的，就是必须以九十天的时间对战俘进行解释工作。
    但是，后来发生的事情十分清楚地说明，联合国军司令部在执行事前安排好的破坏解释工作的计划。国民党和李承晚的特务奉命执行这个计划。他们混入了印度部队看管下的营场，用威胁、恐怖、讹诈和恫吓战俘的手段来破坏解释工作。
    托尔库诺夫继续写道：朝中方面一再要求中立国遣返委员会注意战俘的悲惨境况。对战俘解释工作实际上只进行了十天。因此，朝中方面提出了一个合法的要求，要求补足九十天的解释工作期限。根据停战协定的条款，在九十天的解释工作结束后还未行使其遣返权利的战俘的问题将提交政治会议处理，由会议在三十天内决定战俘的命运。
    然而，中立国遣返委员会的一些委员却在强迫“释放”战俘的威胁之前屈服，公然违反停战协定，采取了将战俘交还原拘留方的决定。
    托尔库诺夫最后着重指出，一切旨在破坏停战和拖延朝鲜问题的最后和平解决的行动都是与和平力量的利益背道而驰的，并阻挠国际紧张局势的进一步缓和。
    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】“红色权利报”二十二日以“美国向朝鲜停战协定发动新攻击并威胁世界和平”为题发表评论说：美方强迫扣留了印度看管部队非法移交过去的朝中战俘，这种行为不仅悍然破坏了规定解释工作应该十足进行九十天的停战协定，同时也严重地违反了人道主义的原则。
   “红色权利报”追述过去朝中方面为公正解决战俘问题与和平解决朝鲜问题所进行的不懈的努力以及美国在通向和平解决朝鲜问题的道路上所制造的障碍。该报写道：美国目前的恶毒行动不能不使人们怀疑美国是否真正希望和平解决朝鲜问题。“美国在朝鲜问题上的新挑衅行为的目的是要使国际紧张局势恶化，从而为美国亿万豪富加紧扩军备战提供借口。对成千上万手无寸铁的战俘进行的罪行只能被认为是反映美方的侵略意图，美国想利用战俘在远东进行侵略冒险行动”。
    “红色权利报”最后说：这种新的挑衅行动再度暴露美国巨头们是和平的敌人。“它再次清楚地说明是什么势力在千方百计地阻止世界紧张局势得到缓和。”
    【新华社布拉格二十二日电】布达佩斯消息：“匈牙利民族报”二十一日发表的一篇文章指出：把朝中战俘交还给所谓联合国军，是违反停战协定的非法行为。所有的事实都证明，美国经过周密的策谋强迫扣留战俘，其目的在于使得国际局势更为紧张。世界舆论愤怒地谴责美国统治集团强迫扣留战俘，借以破坏和平、加剧国际紧张局势的行为，并且坚决要求尽早召开朝鲜问题的政治会议。
