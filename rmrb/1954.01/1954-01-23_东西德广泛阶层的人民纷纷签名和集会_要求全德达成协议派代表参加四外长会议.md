Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 20th: People from broad strata in East and West Germany are demanding that East and West Germany reach an agreement and send an all-German delegation to participate in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

Berlin democratic newspapers reported that in the German Democratic Republic, 5,030,500 people have already signed petitions demanding that a German representative be sent to participate in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

In Berlin, representatives of the German people submit requests daily to the representatives of the Western countries' High Commissioners in Germany, requesting that East and West Germany send representatives to participate in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The French occupation authorities alone have received hundreds of people's resolutions.

Workers from many factories and enterprises in the democratic sector of Berlin and the Western occupation zones have held meetings one after another, demanding that East and West Germany reach an agreement. For example, the "October 7th" machine factory in the Weissensee district held a meeting of 1,700 people, demanding that East and West Germany reach an agreement on all major issues. Nine hundred workers from various industrial enterprises in the Pankow district (Berlin democratic sector) and the Reinickendorf district (French occupation zone) jointly held a meeting, demanding that the Berlin branches of the Free German Trade Union Federation and the West German Trade Union Federation convene an all-Berlin workers' conference in January to formulate and submit recommendations from the Berlin working class to the Foreign Ministers Conference. Members of the factory committee of the Krupp machine factory in Schöneberg (Berlin American occupation zone) also supported the proposal to send German representatives to participate in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. More than 250 doctors from East and West Berlin expressed their hope in a resolution passed at a meeting that the Four-Power Conference would be a complete success, especially that the Four-Power Conference could promote German unification and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, so that medicine would no longer be restricted by artificial divisions, but could serve the welfare of all the German people.

Miners in Mörke, Königfelde, Wattenscheid and other places in the Ruhr area of West Germany passed resolutions at meetings, demanding that all-German representatives attend the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. They also pointed out that the preconditions for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the reunification of Germany must be created at the Four-Power Conference. Unemployed workers in Solingen also made the same request, pointing out that through the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the withdrawal of the occupying forces, West Germany's economy could prosper, thus enabling unemployed workers to find work again.

Sixty-three Social Democrats and trade union workers in Hanover demanded that Germans reach mutual understanding in order to express their wishes at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. They also pointed out, "The Social Democratic Party and the German Communist Party must act in unison."

Many prominent figures in West Germany who advocate a peaceful solution to the German question have published articles in newspapers, demanding that East and West Germany hold negotiations. Prominent West German pastor Mohalski published an article in the "German People's Newspaper" (weekly), calling for negotiations between representatives of East and West Germany to begin for the sake of peace and the interests of all the German people. Prominent social figure and female professor Klara-Maria Fassbinder also wrote an article in the "German People's Newspaper", demanding that representatives from East and West Germany participate in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Former Bonn Federal Parliament member Arnold wrote an article severely criticizing Adenauer's opposition to German representatives participating in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. She demanded that the West German authorities seriously consider the German Democratic Republic's proposals conducive to the peaceful settlement of the German question.

Many pastors in West Germany called on their congregations during sermons to contribute to the success of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Pastor Grieshammer of Hitzkirchen and Pastor Weber of the Offenbach district both advocated forming an all-German delegation to attend the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Weber said: "Every effort must be made to enable people to see the representatives of the entire German people in Berlin. If there is no other way, then at least we should have a delegation composed of both (East and West German) parliaments."

    东西德广泛阶层的人民纷纷签名和集会
    要求全德达成协议派代表参加四外长会议
    【新华社二十日讯】柏林消息：东西德广泛阶层的人民要求东西德达成协议和派遣一个全德代表团参加四国外长会议。
    柏林民主报纸报道：在德意志民主共和国，已经有五百零三万零五百人签名要求派遣德国代表参加四国外长会议。
    在柏林，每天都有德国人民的代表向西方国家驻德高级专员的代表提出请求，由东德和西德派遣代表参加四国外长会议。单是法国占领当局就接到了好几百件人民的决议。
    柏林民主区和西方占领区的许多工厂和企业的工人纷纷举行集会，要求达成东西德协议。例如，威森希区的“十·七”机器制造厂举行了一千七百人的大会，要求东德和西德在一切重大问题上达成协议。潘考夫区（柏林民主区）和雷尼肯多尔夫区（法占区）各工业企业的九百名工人共同举行了会议，要求自由德国工会联合会柏林各分会与西德工会联合会在一月份召开一个全柏林工人会议，拟订并向外长会议提出柏林工人阶级的建议。绍尼堡（柏林美占区）的克虏伯机器制造厂工厂委员会的委员也支持派遣德国代表参加四国外长会议的主张。二百五十多名东西柏林的医生在一个会议上通过的决议中表示希\望四国会议圆满成功，特别是希望四国会议能够促成德国统一和缔\结对德和约，以便使医学不再受人为的分裂的限制，而能够为全德人民的福利服务。
    西德鲁尔地区的莫克、奎尼格费尔德、瓦敦席德等地的矿工集会通过决议，要求全德代表出席四国外长会议。他们并指出，必须在四国会议上为缔结对德和约和重新统一德国创造先决条件。索林根的失业工人也提出了同样的要求，他们并指出，通过缔结对德和约和撤退占领军队，西德的经济可以高涨，从而使失业工人能够重新得到工作。
    汉诺威的六十三个社会民主党人和工会工作者要求德国人互相达成谅解，以便在四国会议上表达他们的愿望。他们并指出，“社会民主党和德国共产党必须一致行动。”
    许多主张和平解决德国问题的西德著名人士在报纸上发表文章，要求举行东西德谈判。西德著名的牧师莫哈尔斯基在“德国人民报”（周报）上发表文章，呼吁为了和平和全体德国人民的利益而开始举行东西德代表的谈判。著名社会人士、女教授克洛拉—玛丽亚·法斯宾德也在“德国人民报”上著文，要求东德和西德的代表参加四国外长会议。前波恩联邦议院议员阿诺德著文严厉斥责阿登纳反对德国代表参加四国外长会议。她要求西德当局认真对待德意志民主共和国有助于和平解决德国问题的建议。
    西德许多牧师在布道时呼吁教徒们促成四国外长会议的成功。希茨基里森的牧师格里斯哈默和奥芬巴赫区的牧师韦伯都主张组成一个全德代表团出席四国外长会议。韦伯说：“必须尽一切力量使得人们能够在柏林看到全德人民的代表，倘若没有别的方法，那么，至少我们应有一个由双方（东西德）议会所组成的代表团。”
