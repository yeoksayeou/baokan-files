    Chen Zhenggen and His House
    Jin Feng
    This was an ordinary semi-basement, one of the thousands upon thousands of semi-basements in Pyongyang. Dug two meters deep into the ground, with wooden planks supporting the ceiling and walls, and stone slabs laid as the heated floor, the four walls were papered with newspapers, making it appear very tidy. It also had a small glass window, just enough to look out at ground level.
    The homeowner, Chen Zhenggen, was an old man in his fifties, and he was the leader of the 15th group in Wancheng-dong, Nam-gu, Pyongyang (equivalent to a residents' group leader in our country). After he invited us to sit down, he began to talk about his house.
    "Three days after the armistice, I started building a house above ground. At that time, there wasn't a single house above ground in this area. It took ten days to build it. It really was the most decent house around! Because everyone else was still living in dugouts. But in less than a month or so, houses were built one after another, built better-looking and more solid than mine. When I looked at my own house again, the walls were made of mud, the roof was covered with broken iron sheets, and a few thin pieces of wood supported it, looking skinny, ugly, and flimsy, so I tore it down and rebuilt it. This time, the walls were made of bricks, the roof was covered with thin stone slabs, and the wood was distributed by the district, thick and large, which finally made it look like something." He pointed to a house outside the window while continuing to speak:
    "This house is temporarily being lent to the People's Army. But I still feel it's not good enough, and when spring comes, when it gets warmer, I'll rebuild it to make it even better. Although our country is in a difficult period of recovery and construction, Pyongyang is the temporary capital of the republic, and the houses should be neat. We want to show our friends that although our country has been destroyed to ruins, we must rebuild it, and we must build it even better."
    At this moment, a special light shone in the kind eyes of Chen Zhenggen, a light that we had seen in the eyes of many Korean people. This was hatred for the enemy, and also pride in their own strength.
    We asked him to talk about the struggle he carried out during the war.
  “The war period?” He paused for a moment, smiling modestly. “Ah! Nothing special, just the most ordinary things, supporting the front lines, organizing air defense. Let’s talk about my house! The enemy bombed it five times, and I built it five times, but there's nothing strange about that, we Korean people all lived through the war like that."
      Then he began to talk about the misfortunes of his house: "On July 4, 1950, the tenth day after the outbreak of the war, my house was bombed. That was the first time it was bombed, and I felt very sad, as if my whole life had been blown to pieces at once. I had nowhere to live that night, and I didn't want to squeeze into someone else's house, so I just spent the night on the side of the road. The next morning, a woman went to fetch water and walked past me, looking at my miserable appearance as if to reproach me:
  ‘The war has just begun, and you're already living on the road, how are you going to live in the future!’ This question was a great education to me, I thought, she’s right, the war has only just begun, and there's still a long way to go, how can I go on like this? As long as I'm alive, as long as I have breath, as long as I have hands, I have to rebuild a house, I have to live bravely. So I repaired a small air-raid shelter while repairing the original house.
      "By September 1950, the house was bombed again. Then, Pyongyang was evacuated. I hurriedly ran to the countryside with my wife and daughter. When Pyongyang was liberated, I left my daughter in the countryside and returned to Pyongyang with my old partner. At that time, Pyongyang was truly a ruin, and enemy planes were constantly bombing. But no matter what, the Republic government was here, the Labor Party was here, and Premier Kim Il-sung was also here. I was born here, grew up here, and can't leave here. My old partner and I picked up a few burnt pieces of wood and some broken iron sheets from the ruins, and barely put up a shed to shield us from the wind and rain. I also continued to do community work. By August 1951, this little shed was bombed again. This was the third time my house had been bombed, and this time it was bombed so badly that not even a single piece of wood could be found. The two of us moved into a public house three hundred meters away from here. After living there for more than ten days, I was still not reconciled, so I repaired the original small air-raid shelter and moved back in. Who knew that the night we moved back, that public house was bombed. Seeing that there were no houses to live in around, and the enemy planes were getting more and more frantic, it was difficult to live above ground, so everyone started digging basements. Not long after my basement was dug, a large bomb landed on my air-raid shelter. This was the fifth time the house I lived in had been bombed. It's just that the basement was full of water everywhere during the rainy season. We couldn't live there for long, so the nearby residents helped me build this semi-basement, and I've been living there ever since the armistice."
    "What force made you build your house several times?" one of our comrades couldn't help but ask.
    "To live on," Chen Zhenggen replied very seriously, "must live on, to do things that are beneficial to the people and to the liberation war of the motherland. The enemy wants to use bombing to destroy our rear, destroy our lives, and destroy our confidence in life. No, this is absolutely impossible." His voice became impassioned, "I am an old man, I cannot do much that is beneficial to the people and the motherland, but I feel that I have a responsibility to live on, and to lead others to live on, to stand firm here—Pyongyang, and not to retreat a step. We will consolidate the rear of the Republic."
      "Also won victory for the front," we said with a smile, and Chen Zhenggen laughed loudly.
    We walked out of the semi-basement together, only to see that in front of the semi-basement was the place where the original air-raid shelter was located, and the large bomb crater had not yet been filled, while behind the semi-basement stood Chen Zhenggen's newly built house, connected on the left and right sides by dozens of newly built houses. Next to Chen Zhenggen's house on the left was a neatly built, beautiful gray brick house, with large glass windows shimmering in the sunlight. No wonder Chen Zhenggen was not satisfied with his current house.

    陈正根和他的房子
    金凤
    这是一间普通的半地下室，平壤成千成万半地下室中间的一个。从地面挖进去两公尺深，用木板支起顶棚和墙壁，再用石板铺成地炕，四壁糊了报纸，显得很整洁。还开了一个小小的玻璃窗，刚刚可以平视地面。
    房主人陈正根是一个五十多岁的老人，他是平壤市南区万城洞十五班的班长（相当于我国的居民组长）。他让我们坐定以后，就讲起他的房子来。
    “停战以后第三天，我就开始在地面上盖房子。那时，这地区还没有一间地上的房子。盖了十天盖好了。真是这一带最像样的房子哩！因为别人还都住在地洞里。可是到不了一个多月，一间间房子都盖起来了，盖得比我的又好看又结实。我再一看自己的房子，墙是泥的，屋顶上是破铁片盖的，几根细木头支撑着，瘦嶙嶙的，又难看，又不结实，我就把它推倒，重新又盖起来。这一回，墙是砖砌的，屋顶是用薄石片盖的，木材是区里发下来的，又粗又大，这才像个样子。他一边用手指着窗外的一间房子，一边继续说着：
    “这房子暂时借给人民军住着。只是我觉得还不够好，等到春天，暖和了，我还要修盖得更好一些。虽然我们国家处在恢复和建设的困难时期，但是平壤是共和国的临时首都，房子总要整齐一些。我们要给我们的朋友看看：虽然我们的国家被破坏得稀烂，但是，我们一定要把它重新建设起来，而且还要建设得更好。”
    这时，在善良的陈正根眼中闪耀着一种特别的光芒，那是我们在许多朝鲜人民眼中看到过的。这是对于敌人的仇恨，也是对于自己力量的骄傲。
    我们要他讲一讲自己在战争时期进行的斗争。
  “战争时期吗？”他沉默了一下，谦逊地笑起来。“啊！没有什么，都是最平常的事，支援前线，组织防空。还是讲一讲我那房子吧！敌人炸了五次，我就盖了五次，不过这也没有什么奇怪，我们朝鲜人民在战争时期都是这样生活过来的。”
      接着他就谈起他那房子的遭遇来：“一九五○年七月四日，战争爆发以后的第十天，我的房子就被炸了。那是第一次被炸，我感到非常伤心、好像自己的生活也一下子都被炸毁了。当天晚上没有地方住，我也不想挤到别人家去，就在公路边胡乱住了一宿。第二天一清早，一个妇女去担水，从我身旁走过，她看着我那狼狈的样子仿佛责备似地说：
  ‘战争才开始，你就住到公路上来了，以后日子你怎么过下去呀！’这一问，可对我是一次大教育，我想，问得对呀，战争才开始打，以后日子还长呢，这样下去还成吗？只要活着，有一口气，有一双手，就要重盖一间房子，就要勇敢地活下去。我就一面修好一个小防空洞，一面修补原来的房子。
      “到一九五○年九月，这房子又被炸了。接着，平壤撤退了。我带着妻子、女儿急急忙忙跑到乡下。等到平壤解放，我把女儿留在乡下，带着老伴又回到了平壤。那时，平壤可真是一片废墟了，敌机还不断来炸。可是不管怎么着，共和国政府在这里，劳动党在这里，金日成首相也在这里。我也是生在这里、长在这里、不能离开这里的。我和老伴在废墟上拣了几根烧剩的木头和一些破铁片，勉强搭起个棚棚，遮风避雨。我还继续做居民工作。到了一九五一年八月，这个小棚棚又被炸了。这是我的房子第三次被炸，这次可炸得连根木头都找不到了，我们老两口就搬到离这里三百公尺远的一家公共房子里去住。住了十多天，我还是不甘心，就把原来的小防空洞修了一下，又搬回来住了。谁知刚搬回来的那一夜，那所公共房子就被炸了。眼看周围没有可住的房屋了，敌机越来越疯狂，地面上是很难生活下去了，大家就都动手挖地下室，我的地下室挖好没有多久，我那个防空洞上就落了个大炸弹。这是我住过的房子第五次被炸。只是地下室一入雨季，到处出水。不能长久住下去，于是附近居民又帮我盖了这个半地下室，我就一直住到停战。”
    “什么力量使得你几次盖起你的房子呢？”我们中间的一个同志不禁在问。
    “要活下去，”陈正根很严肃地回答：“一定要活下去，做对人民、对祖国解放战争有益的事。敌人想用轰炸来破坏我们的后方，破坏我们的生活，破坏我们生活的信心。不，这是绝对办不到的”。他的声音变得激昂起来，“我是一个老头子，我做不了多少对人民对祖国有益的事，但我觉得自己有责任生活下去，也带动别人生活下去，就在这里——平壤，立住脚，不后退一步。我们就巩固了共和国的后方。”
      “也为前方争取了胜利”，我们笑着说，陈正根也大笑起来。
    我们一起走出半地下室，只见半地下室的前面就是原来防空洞的地方，那个大炸弹坑还没有填平，而在半地下室后面就矗立着陈正根新起的那间房子，左右两侧接连着已起了几十间新盖的房子。紧挨着陈正根家左面的是一间垒得很整齐、漂亮的灰色砖屋，大玻璃窗在太阳光中闪耀着。难怪陈正根对自己现在的房子不满意了。
