Lessons from the Deterioration of Military Rubber Shoes

In early 1952, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army stationed on the Korean front ordered a batch of military rubber shoes from within the country. This task was entrusted to the Logistics and Military Supplies Production Department of the North China Military Region. After accepting this task, the department placed orders with the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory and some private factories for processing. However, after inspection, a large portion of these rubber shoes deteriorated, with more than 100,000 pairs becoming waste products. This not only delayed the supply of military needs to the front lines of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, but also seriously wasted the Chinese people's funds for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, causing significant losses to state property.

Why did this batch of military rubber shoes deteriorate? The North China People's Supervisory Committee, in coordination with relevant departments, inspected the entire situation of this incident. The facts fully demonstrate that the deterioration of this batch of military rubber shoes was mainly the result of the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory and some private manufacturers cutting corners and using substandard technical operations. At the same time, it was also caused by the serious bureaucratic working style of the staff of the Logistics and Military Supplies Production Department of the North China Military Region, which was responsible for processing the orders. All of our state organs and enterprise workers should conscientiously learn from this incident to improve our state-owned enterprises and processing and ordering work.

Our state-owned enterprises are socialist in nature, and their management policy is to serve the interests of the state and the people most effectively, and to continuously accumulate funds to strengthen the strength of the state-owned economy, so as to create favorable conditions for the gradual transition of the country to socialism. The only correct way to achieve this goal is, first of all, to guarantee quality and improve quality. All enterprises producing military supplies should implement the idea of "quality first." At the same time, they should strive to improve the production and operation management methods of enterprises, strictly implement economic accounting, so as to increase the quantity of products, reduce the cost of products, accelerate the turnover of funds, and pay more profits to the state under the condition of ensuring quality. In recent years, the vast majority of state-owned enterprises have correctly implemented this policy, and thus have achieved great results. However, the Tianjin military rubber shoe deterioration incident shows that in our state-owned enterprise sector, there are indeed some workers who are not only politically mediocre, only knowing how to work as usual every day, busy with trivial matters, losing their sense of new things, and indifferent to important political issues; but also infected with serious capitalist business ideas, violating the business management policy of state-owned enterprises. They disregard the interests of the state and the people, and aim solely at making profits. Whatever production or operation they consider unprofitable or with smaller profits, even if it is needed by the state and the people, they are unwilling to accept it, or reluctantly accept it and adopt an irresponsible attitude; some even go so far as to destroy the state's policies and laws and damage the state's property in order to pursue illegal profits, show their work achievements, and deceive the trust of their superiors, degenerating into cutting corners and stealing state property like despicable speculative merchants. These people do not understand or have forgotten that our economic workers are not ordinary merchants, but revolutionary political activists who shoulder important tasks in realizing the general line of the country's transition period. Therefore, after accepting the state's entrustment to undertake economic work, they should regard it as a major political task, strictly abide by the policies and laws stipulated by the Party and the state, resolutely rely on the masses of workers and staff, and do a good job in production and operation management.

Some leading cadres of the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory, such as Shi Siliang, the director of the factory, and Liu Tong, the director of the first branch factory, although being workers of state-owned enterprises, did not regard the processing and ordering for national defense construction and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea as the most glorious and important political task, but simply proceeded from the point of view of profit-making. When they felt that "making less money and more trouble," they did not pay attention to such processing and ordering; when they thought that the military's rubber was suitable for making white edging strips for commodity rubber shoes, which could make more money, they used inferior materials to steal and replace good materials. As a result, a large number of substandard products and waste products were produced, which not only affected the supply of military needs to the front lines of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, but also wasted the workers' labor and ruined a large number of useful state materials. This error is extremely serious. This illegal behavior of the factory is not the first time, but has been repeatedly committed without correction. As early as May 1950, when processing and manufacturing rubber shoes for a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, and in August 1951, when processing and manufacturing cotton shoes for the Volunteer Army, the factory had cut corners, and once it was exposed by Wei Shuqing, a workshop inspector. However, the leading cadres of the factory did not learn the lessons they deserved from this, did not know how to correct their mistakes, but instead believed that Wei Shuqing did not safeguard the "interests" of the factory and retaliated against him. All this clearly shows that: it is precisely because the capitalist business thinking of the leading cadres of the Tianjin Rubber Factory has not been corrected for a long time that they have finally degenerated to the point of being despicable speculative merchants, and in order to pursue so-called one-sided "enterprise interests," they have embarked on the criminal road of destroying the military supply tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and destroying state property.

This military rubber shoe deterioration incident also exposed that some staff members in our state organs and military departments have made serious mistakes of bureaucratism, but only examine themselves and refuse to correct them. The Logistics and Military Supplies Production Department of the North China Military Region has caused serious losses to state property due to irresponsibility in military processing and ordering, which is not the first time. As early as in the raincoat processing incident in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao, the department had examined itself for dereliction of duty. Afterwards, the department discovered the illegal behavior of the factory cutting corners when processing in the Tianjin Rubber Factory. This should have aroused the vigilance of the staff of the department, but the fact is not the case. This time, the relevant personnel of the Logistics and Military Supplies Production Department of the North China Military Region, entrusted by the People's Volunteer Army, handled the procedures for processing military rubber shoes, neither studying the relevant regulations on the quality of finished products, nor checking the progress of the work, and even unwilling to look at the agreements and contracts, and the extremely important "formula standard" was also handed over to private merchants to formulate, and there was a lack of supervision and inspection of the factory. This made the factory dare to cut corners wantonly, and even the substandard "formula standard" was not followed. In the packaging of finished products, they also used sacks instead of wooden boxes because they were afraid of trouble; the storage of finished products was even more careless. It should be said that these people have lost their political enthusiasm and high sense of responsibility for the tasks entrusted to them by the people, and they are not good at learning from past failures, so that they have delayed the military supply of the front lines of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and caused unnecessary serious losses to state property, which is obviously not allowed by the laws of the country and the discipline of the Party.

This kind of decadent capitalist business thinking is absolutely incompatible with the socialist nature of state-owned enterprises; this kind of bureaucratic working style that only examines and refuses to correct is also absolutely not allowed in all state organs and enterprise departments. Today, our country has entered the period of planned economic construction. If we do not resolutely overcome the remaining capitalist business thinking of some state-owned enterprises, do not resolutely overcome the bureaucratic working style in our work, and do not proceed from the overall perspective of the interests of the state and the people, but still pursue one-sided "enterprise interests," or treat work with an irresponsible attitude, we will not only fail to complete the tasks assigned by the state and the people, but will inevitably cause significant losses to the state and hinder the smooth progress of economic construction.

In order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, and to effectively improve and improve our work in all aspects, we believe that on the one hand, all state organs and enterprise departments should regularly conduct education on the general line of the state for their staff, continuously improve their policy and ideological level, and strengthen their sense of responsibility for work; for the staff of state-owned enterprises, they should also be educated to learn how to operate and manage enterprises in accordance with socialist principles. On the other hand, our country's procuratorial and supervisory organs should strengthen the inspection and supervision of economic construction departments. For those who have caused serious losses to state property due to serious illegal and dereliction of duty, administrative or legal sanctions must be given according to the seriousness of the circumstances, so as to educate the vast number of state workers and further improve their awareness of abiding by state laws and work discipline. After the military rubber shoe deterioration incident was exposed at the end of 1952, the North China People's Supervisory Committee attached great importance to it and, according to the instructions of the People's Supervisory Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, immediately sent personnel to cooperate with relevant agencies to conduct a detailed inspection. Although a long time was spent in the inspection process due to checking individual circumstances, the entire facts were finally clarified due to the conscientious and responsible attitude of the inspectors. We believe that this spirit of being serious and responsible to the state and the people is very good.

### 军用胶鞋变质事件的教训

    军用胶鞋变质事件的教训
    在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军部队，于一九五二年初向国内订购了一批军用胶鞋。这个任务当时被委托给华北军区后勤军需生产部代为办理。该部接受这个任务之后，即向天津地方国营橡胶厂和部分私营工厂加工订货。但是经过检查，这批胶鞋的产品有很大一部分发生了变质现象，其中有十万多双成了废品。这不但耽误了当时抗美援朝前线的军需供应，而且严重地浪费了我国人民抗美援朝的经费，使国家财产遭受了重大损失。
    这一批军用胶鞋为什么会变质呢？华北人民监察委员会协同有关部门检查了这一事件的全部情况。事实完全证明，这一批军用胶鞋所以会变质，主要是因为天津地方国营橡胶厂和部分私营厂商偷工减料和技术操作不合规定的结果；同时也是承办这次加工订货的华北军区后勤军需生产部工作人员的严重官僚主义作风所造成的结果。我们国家机关和企业的工作人员，都应该认真地从这个事件中，吸取教训，以改进我们的国营企业和加工订货的工作。
    我们的国营企业是社会主义性质的，它的经营方针是最有成效地为国家和人民的利益服务，并不断地积累资金，以壮大国营经济的力量，为逐步实现国家过渡到社会主义创造有利条件。而达到这一目的的唯一正确途径，首先是保证质量，提高质量，所有生产军需产品的企业，更应该贯彻“质量第一”的思想；同时应就努力改进企业的生产和经营管理的方法，严格地实行经济核算，以便在保证质量的条件下增加产品的数量，降低产品的成本，加速资金的周转，向国家缴纳更多的利润。最近几年来，绝大多数的国营企业正确执行了这一方针，因而获得了很大的成绩。但是，这次天津军用胶鞋变质事件说明，在我们的国营企业部门中，确实还有这样一些工作人员，他们不仅是政治上的庸人，每天只知道照例办公，为细小事情而忙碌，对于新鲜事物失去了感觉，对于重要的政治问题漠不关心；而且沾染了严重的资本主义经营思想，违背了国营企业的经营管理方针。他们丝毫不顾国家和人民的利益，而以单纯营利为目的。凡是他们认为无利可图或利润较小的生产或经营，虽然是国家和人民所需要的，他们也不愿意接受，或者勉强接受而采取不负责任的态度；有的甚至为了追逐非法利润，以显示自己的工作成绩，骗取上级的信任，竟至不惜破坏国家的政策法令，不惜毁坏国家的财产，堕落到和卑鄙的投机商人一样地偷工减料，盗窃国家财产。这些人不懂得或者是忘记了，我们的经济工作人员不是一个普通的商人，而是一个革命的政治活动家，他们在实现国家过渡时期的总路线中担负着重大任务。因此他们在接受国家的委托担任经济工作以后，应该把它看成是一个重大的政治任务，严格地遵守党和国家所规定的政策法令，坚决依靠职工群众，搞好生产和经营管理工作。
    天津地方国营橡胶厂的一些领导干部，如该厂总厂长史思良和一分厂厂长刘桐等人，虽然身为国家企业的工作人员，却不把为国防建设和抗美援朝的加工订货看成最光荣、最重大的政治任务，而单纯地从营利观点出发。当他们觉得“赚钱少，麻烦多”的时候，他们对这样的加工订货就不予重视；在他们认为军方的橡胶适于作商品胶鞋的白围条，可以赚钱更多的时候，就用次料盗换好料。结果出产了大量的次品和废品，不仅影响了当时抗美援朝前线的军需供给，而且白白地浪费了工人的劳动力，糟蹋了大量有用的国家物资。这一错误是极其严重的。该厂的这种违法行为已经不是第一次，而是屡犯不改。早在一九五○年五月为解放军某部加工制造胶鞋，在一九五一年八月为志愿军加工制造棉鞋时，该厂就曾经偷工减料，而且有一次被车间检验员魏树清揭发出来了。但是该厂的领导干部并未因此获得应有的教训，不知痛改前非，反而认为魏树清不维护厂方的“利益”，对他加以报复打击。这一切都清楚地说明了：正是由于天津橡胶厂领导干部的资本主义经营思想长期没有被纠正，终于使他们堕落到卑鄙的投机商人的地步，为了追求所谓片面的“企业利益”，而走上了破坏抗美援朝军需任务和毁坏国家财物的犯罪道路。
    这次军用胶鞋变质事件也暴露出来，在我们的国家机关和军事部门中，有些工作人员曾经犯了严重的官僚主义的错误，却只以检讨了事，不肯改正。华北军区后勤军需生产部在军用加工订货中，因为工作不负责任而使国家财产受到严重损失，这已经不是第一次。早在北京、天津、青岛三市雨衣加工事件中，该部就因为工作失职作过检讨。其后该部在向天津橡胶厂加工中，又发现了厂方偷工减料的不法行为。这就应该引起该部的工作人员有所警惕才是，但是事实并不是这样。这次华北军区后勤军需生产部的有关人员，接受人民志愿军的委托，代办军用胶鞋加工的手续，既不研究有关成品质量的各种规定，也不检查工作进行的情况，甚至连协议书和合同都不愿意看，极为重要的“配方标准”也交给私商去拟订，而又缺乏对厂方的监督和检查，这就使得厂方敢于放肆地偷工减料，连不够标准的“配方标准”也没有遵照执行。在成品的包装上，他们也因为怕麻烦，用麻袋代替木箱；对于成品的保管更是马马虎虎。应该说，这些人对于人民委托给他们的任务失掉了政治热情和高度的责任心，更不善于从过去的失败中吸取教训，以致贻误了抗美援朝前线的军需供给，并使国家财产遭受到不应有的严重损失，这显然是国家的法律和党的纪律所不容许的。
    这种腐朽的资本主义经营思想，是和社会主义性质的国营企业绝不相容的；这种只检讨而不肯改正的官僚主义作风，也是一切国家机关和企业部门所绝对不能容许的。今天，我们的国家已进入了计划经济建设时期，如果不坚决克服某些国营企业残存的资本主义经营思想，不坚决克服工作中的官僚主义作风，不从国家和人民利益的全局观点出发，而仍然在那里追求片面的“企业利益”，或者以不负责任的态度对待工作，就不仅不能完成国家和人民交付的任务，而且必然给国家造成重大损失，妨碍经济建设工作的顺利进行。
    为了在今后防止类似事件的发生，并切实改进和提高我们各方面的工作，我们认为一方面是一切国家机关和企业部门，都应经常对所属工作人员进行国家总路线的教育，不断地提高他们的政策思想水平，加强他们的工作责任心；对于国营企业的工作人员，还应教育他们学会按照社会主义的原则来经营和管理企业。另一方面我们国家的检察和监察机关，则应加强对经济建设部门的检查和监督工作，对于因严重违法失职而造成国家财产严重损失的分子，必须视其情节的轻重，分别给予行政的或法律的处分，借以教育广大的国家工作人员，进一步提高他们遵守国家法令和工作纪律的观念。这次军用胶鞋变质事件在一九五二年底被揭发后，华北人民监察委员会极为重视，根据中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会指示，立即派员协同有关机关作了详细的检查。而在检查过程中虽因查对个别情况而花费了很长的时间，但由于检查人员的认真负责，终于把全部事实弄清楚了。我们认为这种对国家和人民严肃负责的精神是很好的。
