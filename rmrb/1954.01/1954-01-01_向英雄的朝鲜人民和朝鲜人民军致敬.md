    A Salute to the Heroic Korean People and the Korean People's Army
    Chen Yi
    I have visited Korea three times, and my impression has become more profound each time, and Korea's development and progress in the war has also become more significant each time.
    Some time ago, I stood in front of the Pubyok Pavilion under Moranbong Peak, looking up at the sky. The sky was so clear, and the sun was as warm as in my motherland. The Korean mountains in the distance were so beautiful! The Taedong River in front of me was so calm! Especially those chimneys on the opposite bank of the river, standing tall, some already smoking. Seeing these scenes, while breathing the fresh air of Moranbong, the most beautiful place in this heroic city, and watching these moving and unforgettable scenes, I couldn't help but say to myself:
    Is this Pyongyang? Is this the heroic city of Pyongyang that I have visited back and forth more than a dozen times at night? Recalling those past years, everything is still fresh in my memory. The first night I arrived in Pyongyang, I heard the anti-aircraft guns firing. I could see the sparks from the anti-aircraft guns very clearly, and I could also hear the sound of enemy planes and the sound of bombs exploding very clearly. At the same time, the voices from the loudspeakers on the side of the road calling on the citizens to fight bravely were also very clear. Everyone—including us—was tense, but also proud, because we were fighting against the most vicious and brutal enemy in the world.
    Returning from a visit to the front line, just as I entered the city of Pyongyang, the scene was the same as the first night I arrived in Pyongyang. The difference was that it was daytime. I saw the market, I saw the people coming and going, everything was so well-organized. The enemy planes did not subdue them. I personally saw them tidying up the bombed houses and carrying away the dead. I did not see any fear in them. That same night, I visited a hospital near Pyongyang. I could hardly believe my eyes, because what was presented to me was such a clean arrangement of beds and some glorious warriors lying comfortably on the beds. What moved me most was a large wounded soldier transfer station, which had to transport the wounded from the front line overnight.
    This was an extremely complex organizational task, but they completed it very well.
    Later, I visited a corps headquarters of the People's Army and met many generals and warriors. They talked about their transfer from South Korea. Not only were they unharmed, but they also attacked the enemy and opened up work in three counties.
    Finally, I also met Marshal Kim Il-sung. It was still in 1951, but even then he told us of the Korean people's conviction of victory.
    All of this has never been forgotten in my heart. Especially on the way back and forth to the front and rear, seeing the American imperialist beasts setting fire to the mountains, many cities were razed to the ground, and I had personally walked through many of those leveled areas. My hatred for the enemy is exactly the same as that of the Koreans. At that time, I only had one thought in mind: let our army—the Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers—beat them hard! These murderous criminals!
    When I came to Pyongyang this time, my third time, the murderous criminals were forced to sign the armistice agreement. Pyongyang began a peaceful life, especially because this time I came entirely during the day. Not only could I watch the beautiful Korean scenery from Pubyok Pavilion, but more importantly, I could see Pyongyang recovering. There were so many houses! The lights were so bright at night! What excited and admired me most was that everyone in Pyongyang—men, women, old, young, civilians, soldiers—were so busy, moving stones, carrying rubble, not a single idle person, all devoted to cleaning, restoring, and building. Especially the warriors of the People's Army, like in battle, were again at the forefront. Those damaged houses had been re-fitted with doors and windows, and every house emitted light at night. My emotions were uncontrollably excited. Whenever this scene appeared before my eyes, I always stared at it for a long time, until I let out a long breath.
    This is an invincible people, an invincible country! With such people defending and building such a country, the arrival of this country's prosperity will not take many days.
    I am also deeply honored to have visited this country and its people three times. The education it has given me is something I can never forget, and it is also a milestone in my personal progress. Therefore, I must thank this heroic country and its heroic people and their heroic army.
    All of this, in addition to the wise leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Workers' Party, was fought for by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, minute by minute, second by second, with every drop of sweat and every drop of blood. As a soldier, I deeply understand the meaning of this battle.
    From the perspective of our country, the heroic Korean people and their heroic sons and daughters—the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers—fought side by side, blocking and defeating American imperialism. This played the most direct role in shielding the construction of our motherland. Everyone in our country understands that it is because of this victory that our people can live a peaceful life, our country can build with peace of mind, and our first five-year plan can be realized.
    Thinking of this, I think of the friendship between our two countries. Why is it said to be a fighting friendship, a friendship forged in blood, and an unbreakable friendship?
    I think there is no need for me to explain a single word. The three years of war have practically educated us, and the people of our two countries can consciously answer.
    Let us celebrate this eternal and unbreakable friendship forged in blood!
    Let us further consolidate and develop this friendship by being vigilant against enemies who sabotage our recovery and reconstruction efforts!
    Thank you to the heroic Korean people, and wish them greater victories in their recovery and reconstruction work!
    Thank you to the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and wish them further new achievements in training and improving their tactics and techniques!

### 向英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军致敬

    向英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军致敬
    陈沂
    我曾经三次访问朝鲜，我的印象一次比一次深刻，而朝鲜在战争中的发展和进步也一次比一次显著。
    前些时，我站在牡丹峰下的浮碧楼前，仰望着天空，天是那样的晴朗，太阳跟在我的祖国一样温暖，远远的朝鲜的山多清秀呀！眼前的大同江河水多平静呀！特别是江对岸的那些烟囱，一个个的矗立着，有的已经在冒烟，看到这些情景，我一边呼吸着这个英雄城市最秀丽的地方——牡丹峰的新鲜空气，一边观看这些动人的难忘的情景，我不禁自己对自己说：
    这就是平壤吗？这就是我过去十几次夜间来来去去的英雄城——平壤吗？想起那些过去的岁月，一切都还很新的留在我的记忆里。第一夜到平壤，就听到高射炮响，从高射炮发出的火花，看得很清楚，而敌机的声音，投弹爆炸的声音也听得很清楚，同时马路边号召市民奋勇斗争的广播扩音器中发出的声音也很清楚，所有的人——包括我们都在内，都是紧张的，然而也是自傲的，因为我们是在和全世界最凶恶最残暴的敌人在斗争。
    从前线访问回来，刚进入平壤城，情景也是同第一夜到平壤城一样，不同的已经是在白天，我看了市场，我看了来来往往的人，是那样的井井有条，敌机没有使他们屈服，我亲眼看到他们收拾被炸的房子，抬走被炸死的人，我没有从他们身上看到一点畏惧。就在那天晚上，我访问了平壤附近的医院，我几乎不能相信我的眼睛，因为呈现在我眼前的是那样整洁的已经安置好的床位和躺在床位上的很舒适的一些光荣的勇士们，尤其使我感动的是一个大的伤员运转站，要在一夜之间把前线下来的伤员运走。
    这是一个极为复杂的组织工作，然而他们完成得很好。
    以后我又访问了一个人民军的军团部，遇见很多将军们、勇士们，他们谈到他们从南朝鲜转移回来，不仅自己未受损失，还打击了敌人，还开辟了三个郡的工作。
    最后我还晋见了金日成元帅，那还是在一九五一年，但就在那时他就把朝鲜人民必胜的信念告诉我们了。
    所有这一切，在我的心里是从来没有忘记过的。尤其在来回前线和后方的路上，看见美帝国主义野兽们放火烧山，许多城市被夷为平地，而那些平地很多我都亲自走过，我对敌人的仇恨同朝鲜人是完全一样的。我当时只有一个想头，让我们的军队——朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军狠狠地揍他们吧！这些杀人的凶犯们！
    当我这次，也是第三次来到平壤，杀人的凶犯被迫在停战协定上签了字，平壤开始了和平生活，特别因为这次来完全是白天。不仅使我可以在浮碧楼观看美丽的朝鲜山水，更重要的是使我能看到平壤在恢复，房子是那样的多啊！晚上灯光是那样的明亮！尤其使我感到兴奋和敬佩的，在平壤的每一个人——男的、女的、老的、少的、老百姓、军人都是那样的忙碌，搬石头，抬瓦砾，没有一个闲人，整个都投在扫除、恢复和建设中，特别是人民军的勇士们，跟打仗一样又走在前面。那些被毁坏的房子，已经重新装起了门窗，晚上每间房子都发出灯光，我的感情抑制不住的激动，每当这种情景出现在我的眼前，我总是要注目看个好久，一直到吐一口长气。
    这就是不可战胜的人民，不可战胜的国家！有这样的人民保卫和建设这样的国家，这个国家昌盛的到来是要不到多少日子的。
    我也深以能三次访问这个国家和这个国家的人民为荣，他所给我的教育是我永远不能忘记的，对我个人的进步也是一个里程碑，因此，我必须感谢这个英雄的国家和英雄的人民以及他们英雄的军队。
    所有这一切，除了金日成元帅和劳动党的英明领导外，就是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军一分钟、一秒钟、一滴汗、一滴血战斗出来的，我是一个军人，我深深懂得这个战斗的意义。
    从我们国家来讲，英雄的朝鲜人民及他们英雄的子弟——朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩作战，挡住并击败了美帝国主义，这对我们祖国的建设起了最直接的屏障作用。我们国家每一个人都懂得是因为有了这个胜利，才使得我们人民能够过和平生活，我们国家才能安心建设，我们的第一个五年计划才得实现。
    想到这里，就想到我们两国的友谊，为什么说是战斗的、鲜血结成的和牢不可破的呢？
    我想，无须我解释一个字，三年的战争实际教育了我们，我们两国人民都能自觉的回答。
    让我们庆祝这个永远的牢不可破的用血结成的友谊吧！
    让我们从战后恢复和重建工作中，警惕敌人破坏我们的恢复和重建工作中来进一步巩固和发展这个友谊吧！
    感谢英雄的朝鲜人民，预祝他们在恢复和重建工作中获得更伟大的胜利！
    感谢英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，预祝他们在练兵和提高战术、技术上有更进一步的新成就！
