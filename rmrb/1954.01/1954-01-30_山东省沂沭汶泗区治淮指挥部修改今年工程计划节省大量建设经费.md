　　Revises This Year's Project Plan, Saving a Significant Amount of Construction Funds
    The Shandong Province Yi, Shu, Wen, Si Region Huai River Harnessing Headquarters has revised its 1954 project plan and technical designs, saving a significant amount of construction funds. The headquarters had achieved some success in saving administrative expenses during the increase production and practice economy movement, but had not paid enough attention to project planning and design. After the Huai River basin water conservancy work conference held before the new year, the leading comrades of the headquarters clearly recognized the importance of doing a good job in planning and design and using national construction funds correctly. They then inspected the 1954 project plans, both large and small, and specially organized personnel to conduct in-depth on-site surveys for projects with insufficient data or a lack of benefit explanations. The survey results revealed that many aspects of the original plans and designs were not entirely reasonable, and many projects could be postponed or canceled. For example, the original plan was to excavate a water interception ditch at Baliling to divert water from the ridge into the Yi River to alleviate waterlogging in the area. This project, including culverts, required an expenditure of 1.005 billion yuan. After the survey, it was found that the ditch would occupy 250 mu of land, and the temporary increase in waterlogged area would also be 250 mu. Therefore, this project could be canceled, and it was decided not to proceed. Another example is the Yi River South Port bank protection project, which was originally decided to be undertaken based on the opinion of the local government. However, after this survey, it was considered that the banks of the Yi River South Port would not have problems even in the event of a flood like the one in the summer of 1953. This project was also decided not to be undertaken, thus saving more than 400 million yuan in expenses. In addition, the original plan also prepared to build more than ten bridges on the drainage system along the Yi River. After repeated studies, it was considered that the drainage system along the river did not hinder production and transportation, so it was decided not to build the bridges.
    Through this inspection and revision of the project plan and technical design, not only has a large amount of project expenses been saved for the country, but also a great education has been given to the cadres. Everyone has deeply realized that only by doing a good job in planning and design can the blindness in the work be overcome.

　　山东省沂沭汶泗区治淮指挥部
　　修改今年工程计划节省大量建设经费
    山东省沂沭汶泗区治淮指挥部修改了一九五四年工程计划和技术设计，节省了大量工程经费。该部在增产节约运动中，对行政经费的节省有一些成绩，但对工程的规划设计还不够重视。通过年前召开的淮河流域水利工作会议以后，该部领导同志才明确认识到做好规划设计工作、正确地使用国家建设资金的重要性，从而把一九五四年大小工程计划进行了检查，凡是资料不足，缺乏效益说明的工程，都专门组织了人员深入实地勘查。勘查的结果发现原来的计划和设计有很多地方不尽合理，不少工程可以不办或缓办。如原计划在八里岭开挖一条截水横沟，将岭上的水引入沂河，以减轻该地区的内涝。这一工程连涵洞在内需要经费十亿零五千万元。经过勘查发现挖沟所占的土地有二百五十亩，而临时增大内涝面积也是二百五十亩。因此，这一工程是可以不办的，便决定不办。又如沂河南港护岸工程，原根据当地政府意见决定兴办，经过这次勘查认为沂河南港两岸，在像一九五三年夏天那样洪水的情况下，不会发生问题，此项工程也决定不办，这样也节省了经费四亿多元。此外，原计划还准备在沂河沿岸排水系统上造桥梁十余座，经过多次研究，认为沿河的排水系统对生产交通都没有妨碍，所以也就决定不再修筑桥梁。
    通过这次检查与修改工程计划以及技术设计，不仅为国家节省了大量的工程费用，并给干部以很大教育，大家都深刻地认识到只有做好规划设计工作，才能克服工作中的盲目性。
