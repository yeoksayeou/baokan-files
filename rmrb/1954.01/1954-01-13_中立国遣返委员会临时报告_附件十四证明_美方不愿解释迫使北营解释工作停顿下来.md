Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 11th: Annex XIV to the "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," which contains protest letters from South Korean POWs and American and British POWs in Songgok-ri to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, further proves that the suspension of explanation work in Songgok-ri is entirely due to the US side's unwillingness to provide adequate explanations to the POWs and guarantee their legitimate right to return home and live peaceful lives.

After the US side began explanation work to the POWs on December 2nd of last year, the US explanation personnel, apart from spouting nonsense about the "free world" under the reactionary rule of the US and Syngman Rhee, were unwilling to tell the POWs anything about their future and lives. The POWs had to demand that they provide full explanations, especially to give them a definite guarantee of returning home to live peaceful lives. However, whenever the POWs raised questions in their hearts and asked for clarification, the US explanation personnel evaded answering questions and providing guarantees by interrupting the explanations and leaving the tents, and even intimidated, insulted, and verbally abused the POWs, and even forced affiliated institutions to use force to drive the POWs out of the tents. For this reason, South Korean POWs and American and British POWs submitted protests to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on December 11th and 13th of last year, respectively. However, the US side was still unwilling to change this behavior that violated the "Terms of Reference," and finally forced the explanation work to be suspended.

The protest letter from the South Korean POWs stated: "We have always respected the Korean Armistice Agreement, which is an international treaty, and we respect the 'Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work' put forward by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. As truly educated Korean youths and peace-loving citizens of the world, we went to listen to the explanations in an open and honest manner. Since, according to Article 3, Paragraph 8 of the 'Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission,' we should be informed of 'any matters relating to... returning home,' especially that we 'have complete freedom to return home and live a peaceful life,' therefore we should have the right to ask questions in all circumstances about places where we have questions or concerns. Since we have been away from South Korea for a long time, there will inevitably be many doubts when we decide our attitude. Therefore, in view of past facts, only by solving the ambiguities and unconvincing aspects of the explanations currently being conducted by the explanation personnel can we make a safe decision about our lifelong issues. Therefore, we have the right to express our opinions."

The protest letter stated: "Let us take a look at the explanation personnel who come before us. They come with preconceived conclusions and prejudices. One cannot help but suspect that they are only here to insult and slander. These people openly slander, insult, and threaten by the most despicable and cunning means, and they are becoming increasingly worse. They brazenly and continuously provoke us with malicious slander and insults, and enrage us with contemptuous teasing and ridicule. They have been using words that are irrelevant to the explanation to slander... slandering and defaming the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, attempting to deceive and coerce us. Not only do they interrupt or ignore our speeches, but they even leave the meeting before we have reached a conclusion, which is obviously a deliberate attempt to sabotage the meeting." The protest letter said: "When we raise questions about our vague areas based on our own outlook on life during the explanation process, they refuse in panic and even talk such nonsense."

The protest letter from the American and British POWs stated: "Korean POWs who are not directly repatriated are very willing to listen to the explanations. Their cooperation to this day proves this; therefore, we request that if they want to listen to the explanations, they should be given the necessary explanations to ensure that they are satisfied with the explanations within the ninety-day period." After listing the facts of threats, intimidation, and insults made by the US explanation personnel to the South Korean POWs during the explanation process, the protest letter said: "What has the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission done about these things? As far as we know, nothing has been done. But you asked us to come and listen to the explanations, causing us to be humiliated and slandered by the explanation personnel. This is ridiculous. We will refuse to attend and listen to the explanations until this situation is corrected. This does not mean that we refuse to listen to the explanations. No, on the contrary, we welcome explanations. We only ask that we be able to avoid being slandered, humiliated, and politically attacked by the explanation personnel. We only ask that explanations continue to be given to the Korean POWs who are not directly repatriated before we listen to the explanations, and that it be completed. Korean POWs request and welcome explanations, so we request that they be allowed to listen to the explanations; we request that we be given the right to listen to explanations within the ninety-day period until individuals make a decision."

### “中立国遣返委员会临时报告”附件十四证明  美方不愿解释迫使北营解释工作停顿下来

    “中立国遣返委员会临时报告”附件十四证明
    美方不愿解释迫使北营解释工作停顿下来
   【新华社平壤十一日电】“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”附件十四，松谷里的南朝鲜战俘和美、英战俘对中立国遣返委员会提出的抗议信进一步证明：松谷里解释工作的陷于停顿，完全是由于美方不愿对战俘进行充分的解释，保证他们回家过和平生活的合法权利。
    去年十二月二日美方对战俘的解释工作开始以后，美方解释人员除了胡扯一通美李反动统治下的“自由世界”外，一点儿也不肯告诉战俘有关他们前途和生活的事情。战俘不得不要求他们进行充分的解释，特别是要求给予他们回家过和平生活的确实保证。但是每当战俘提出他们心里的疑问要求予以澄清时，美方解释人员却以中断解释、退出帐篷等办法逃避答复问题和提出保证，并且对战俘进行恫吓、侮辱和谩骂，甚至迫使附属机构用武力把战俘赶出帐篷。为此，南朝鲜战俘和美、英战俘分别在去年十二月十一日和十三日对中立国遣返委员会提出抗议。但是，美方仍然不愿改变这种违反“职权范围”的行为，终于迫使解释工作陷于停顿。
    南朝鲜战俘的抗议信说：“我们始终尊重作为国际条约的朝鲜停战协定，并且尊重中立国遣返委员会提出的‘解释和访问工作细则’，作为真正有教育的朝鲜青年，和世界上爱好和平的公民，我们光明正大地前往听取解释。既然按照‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’第三条第八款应告知我们‘任何有关……回返家乡的事项’，特别是我们‘有回家过和平生活的完全自由’，因此我们应当有权在一切场合就我们有疑问或顾虑的地方提出问题。由于我们离开南朝鲜已久，因此当我们决定态度时必然会存在着许多疑虑。因此，鉴于过去的事实，只有解决了目前解释人员进行的解释中的含糊和不能令人信服的地方，我们才能放心地决定自己的终身问题。因此，我们有权利提出意见。”
    抗议信说：“让我们看一看到我们面前来的解释人员吧。他们带着先入为主的结论和偏见。人们不禁怀疑他们是否只是为进行侮辱与诬蔑而来的。这些人以最卑鄙和圆滑的手段，公然进行诬蔑、侮辱、威胁，而且日益变本加厉。他们悍然不断以恶劣的诬蔑和侮辱进行挑衅，以轻视人的戏弄和嘲笑使我们激愤。他们一直用与解释毫不相干的话进行诽谤……诽谤和诬蔑朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，企图借此欺骗和胁迫我们。他们不仅中断或不听我们的发言，而且甚至在我们尚未下结论之前就退场，这显然是故意破坏会议。”抗议信说：“当我们在解释过程中根据我们自己的人生观就我们模糊不清的地方提出问题时，他们却惊惶万状地加以拒绝，而且竟如此胡说八道。”
    美、英战俘的抗议信说：“朝鲜籍不直接遣返的战俘是很愿意听取解释的。他们直到今天的合作证明了这一点；因此，我们要求如果他们要听取解释，他们就应该得到必要的解释，以保证他们在九十天期限内满意地听到解释。”抗议信在列举了美方解释人员在解释过程中对南朝鲜战俘进行的威胁、恫吓和侮辱的事实后说：“中立国遣返委员会对于这些事情怎样办的呢？据我们所知并没有怎么办。但是你们却叫我们来听解释，使我们遭到解释人员的凌辱和诽谤。这是可笑的。在这种情形获得纠正之前我们将拒绝出席听取解释。这并不是说我们拒绝听取解释。不，正相反，我们欢迎解释。我们只要求使我们能够不遭受解释人员的诽谤、凌辱及政治性的攻击。我们只要求在我们听取解释之前应继续向朝鲜籍不直接遣返的战俘进行解释，并进行完毕。朝鲜战俘要求并欢迎解释，因此我们要求让他们听取解释；我们要求在九十天期限内给予我们听解释的权利一直到个人作出决定时为止。”
