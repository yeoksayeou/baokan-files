    Lenin—Organizer of the Soviet Communist Party
    USSR, A. Likhatchev

    V.I. Lenin, the genius successor to Marx and Engels, creatively developed Marxism under new historical conditions and came to the conclusion that imperialism could not be overthrown and the proletariat—the most advanced revolutionary class of modern times—could not seize power without creating a new type of militant revolutionary party. Only such a party possesses the fearless spirit to lead the proletariat to seize power, the rich experience to understand the complex conditions of the revolutionary situation, and the ability to very skillfully circumvent the various reefs on the road to its goal. In the struggle against the open and hidden enemies of Marxism and against various forms of opportunism in the workers' movement, Lenin laid and defended the theoretical, organizational, and practical foundations of a new type of party—the Bolshevik Party. Joseph V. Stalin, Lenin's loyal student and comrade-in-arms, established and strengthened the Party together with Lenin.

    The Soviet Communist Party has gone through a glorious, half-century-long path of development, a path that has grown from the small Marxist groups that began in Russia in the 1880s to the powerful party that is now the leading and dominant force in Soviet society, with seven million members.

    Lenin's struggle for a new type of Marxist party began at a turning point in the international workers' movement. At this time, capitalism entered the final stage of its development—the stage of imperialism, and the era of the proletariat's direct struggle to overthrow capitalism, establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, and strive for socialism had arrived.

    During this period, Russia was the gathering point of imperialist contradictions and the source of various oppressions—capitalist oppression, colonial oppression, and military oppression. Domestically, the bourgeois democratic revolution led by the working class was maturing. The center of the international revolutionary movement shifted to Russia.

    The most important political task of the Russian proletariat was to overthrow the Tsarist autocracy—the bulwark of world reaction. In order to successfully accomplish this historic mission of the Russian proletariat, a militant revolutionary party was needed that could lead the proletariat to defeat Tsarism, the Russian bourgeoisie, and the landlords. This party could not be an ordinary social democratic party of the Western European type, as the social democratic parties of Western Europe were the tail of opportunists, fantasizing about "social reform" and fearing socialist revolution.

    The earliest seeds of a revolutionary proletarian party in Russia, arising from the workers' movement, were the "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class" in St. Petersburg, founded by Lenin in 1895. Under Lenin's leadership, the "League of Struggle" was the first to combine socialism and the workers' movement in Russia.

    In 1898, the First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was convened, and this congress announced the establishment of the Marxist party in Russia. However, the congress did not unite the scattered social democratic groups into a unified and centralized organization, nor did it stipulate a party program and constitution. The Party Central Committee elected by the congress was quickly arrested by the Tsarist government. Local social democratic organizations remained ideologically scattered, and the opportunistic tendency of "Economism"—which denied the political struggle of the working class and its leading role in the revolutionary movement—ran rampant. Lenin worked intensively for several years to overcome this disunity, overcome opportunistic wavering, and prepare for the establishment of the Party.

    At the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in July 1903, a revolutionary Marxist party was founded, at a time when Russia was standing at the doorstep of the bourgeois democratic revolution, and the Russian proletariat had become the vanguard of the world revolutionary movement.

    The all-Russian Marxist political newspaper "Iskra" (The Spark), organized and led by Lenin, played a decisive role in the ideological and organizational preparation of the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. The party program and organizational principles formulated by Lenin's "Iskra" were completely victorious at the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. The Party Congress overturned all opportunistic amendments and approved the party program proposed by "Iskra." The party program stipulated that the central task was the struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat, and included revolutionary democratic demands regarding the peasant question, as well as a clause on national self-determination. The Leninist program adopted by the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party became the great banner of the Russian working class in its struggle for power, and the congress itself was a turning point in the world labor movement.

    Lenin's classic works "What Is to Be Done?", "One Step Forward, Two steps Back," "Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution," and "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" were of extremely great significance for the establishment of the Russian Marxist party. In these brilliant works, Lenin formulated the unshakeable ideological and organizational foundations of the Party, and formulated the Party's tactics and theoretical principles. Lenin's greatest achievement was that in his works he developed the idea of the leadership of the proletariat in the bourgeois democratic revolution, and pointed out that under the historical conditions at that time, the establishment of a worker-peasant alliance to ensure proletarian leadership was a necessary condition for the victory of the revolution. Guided by Lenin's theory of proletarian revolution and using the revolutionary tactics formulated by Lenin, the Russian working class established an alliance with the poor peasants, overthrew the bourgeois regime in October 1917 (Russian calendar), and established a truly people's regime—the Soviet regime. In this way, the chain of world imperialism was broken, and the first Soviet socialist state in the world was established.

    The Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia opened a new era in human history, an era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism. The victory of the October Revolution was the triumph of Lenin's theory of proletarian revolution, and at the same time, the Soviet Communist Party had become a force of international significance, a "shock brigade" of the world revolution and workers' movement.

    After defending the dictatorship of the proletariat in a fierce struggle against domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries, and after crushing foreign interventionists and White Guard elements, the Communist Party launched a tremendous effort to implement Lenin's plan for socialist construction. Based on a profound Marxist analysis of the contradictions of imperialism, Lenin came to the brilliant conclusion that socialism could first be victorious in several countries, or even in one country. He pointed out that in our Soviet country, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, we have all the necessary conditions to build socialism.

    After Lenin's death, the Soviet Communist Party, headed by Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, shattered the conspiracies of the Trotsky-Bukharin elements and other traitors who attempted to lead the Party away from the Leninist line and towards the restoration of capitalism, defended Leninism, and adopted a firm policy of building socialism in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Party's construction of socialism was based on the objective laws of socio-economic development, the mature demands of the development of society's material life, and the interests of the people.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, and relying on the Soviet system, the Soviet people built first-rate industry and huge socialist agriculture in the years of the pre-war five-year plans. Thanks to the implementation of the plans for national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, the Soviet state made a major leap forward, from a backward country to an advanced country, from an agricultural country to a powerful socialist country with a developed industry and a collective farm system. The Soviet Union has completely eliminated the exploiting classes and the phenomenon of man exploiting man, and has permanently eliminated crises, unemployment, and the poverty of the working masses. Our country has established various conditions for continuously improving the material and cultural living standards of the working people.

    The Soviet people, led by the Communist Party, were the first in human history to build a new social system—socialism.

    The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union has been consolidated in legal form by the Soviet Constitution. This constitution reflects the most democratic system in the world. The Soviet Communist Party implemented the proletarian method of solving the national question, established the complete equality of all nationalities and tribes in our country, and strove to overcome the economic and cultural backwardness of the previously oppressed nationalities of Russia, uniting all nationalities into a unified fraternal family, thereby establishing a powerful multi-ethnic socialist state.

    The Party and the Soviet government have implemented the most profound cultural revolution, turning the Soviet Union into a country without illiteracy and a center of progressive culture and science. The spiritual and political unity of the Soviet state, the friendship of all nationalities, and Soviet patriotism, etc., have developed and consolidated on the socialist basis of the Soviet Union.

    Thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people defeated German fascism and Japanese imperialism during the Great Patriotic War, achieving a victory of world historical significance. The war once again eloquently proved the great superiority of the socialist system and its endless vitality, and proved the invincible power of the Soviet state. The Soviet people, with selfless struggle, not only defended their freedom and independence, but also rescued the people of Europe and Asia from the threat of fascist enslavement. Due to the heroic victory of the Soviet army, many countries in Europe and Asia broke away from the capitalist system and established people's democratic systems. The people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Albania, and other countries have been freed from the shackles of imperialism and have established people's democratic systems that fulfill the duties of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and are currently successfully building socialism. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China was a particularly powerful blow to the imperialist system.

    The 19th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, held in October 1952, made a brilliant summary of the struggles and victories of the Soviet people, and stipulated the path for the Soviet state to continue to advance towards communism. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party held in September 1953 decided on some practical measures to further develop all sectors of agriculture, expand the production of agricultural products, and improve the material welfare of the working people.

    In the half-century of heroic struggle for the freedom and happiness of the working people, the Soviet Communist Party has won the boundless love and trust of the Soviet people. The Soviet people call the Communist Party their beloved party, they see that the Party's policies reflect their vital interests, reflect their desires and ideals, and therefore unanimously support all the Party's initiatives and actively struggle to implement the Party's policies. The Communist Party relies on the creative initiative of millions of working masses in all its activities. The working masses are the true creators of history and the creators of all material wealth.

    Lenin, the founder and leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, repeatedly pointed out that the reason why the Party is strong, powerful, and invincible is because of its close ties with the masses. Lenin taught the Party not to be satisfied with what it has achieved, to constantly treat its work with a critical attitude, and to expose and resolutely eliminate the shortcomings in its work. Criticism and self-criticism are a special communist method of educating cadres and a regular and effective weapon of the Party.

    The Communist Party constantly enhances the political and economic power of the Soviet state, consolidates the alliance between the working class and the collective farmers, and consolidates the fraternal cooperation and friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. The Party constantly cares about the consolidation and unity of its ranks, carries out an irreconcilable struggle against the remnants of the crushed anti-Leninist groups, against all distortions of Marxism-Leninism, and against the manifestations of bourgeois ideology, and works strongly to overcome the capitalist remnants that have not yet been eliminated from people's thinking.

    The Communist Party takes the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism as the guide for all its activities. The strength of Marxist-Leninist theory lies in its ability to correctly assess the situation, to understand the internal connections of events, and to not only be able to discern how events are currently developing and where they are developing, but also to be able to discern how events will develop and where they will develop in the future. Marxist-Leninist theory is a scientific reflection of the fundamental interests of the working class and all working people, and is a powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary transformation of society.

    Based on the Leninist-Stalinist principle that two opposing social systems can coexist peacefully, the Party and the Soviet government have consistently pursued a policy of maintaining and consolidating peace, and a policy of expanding business relations with all countries on the principle of mutual respect for interests.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, and inspired by the victorious doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the Soviet people are courageously marching forward towards new victories in the construction of communism.

    列宁——苏联共产党的组织者
    苏联　阿·李赫拉特
    马克思和恩格斯的天才继承者乌·伊·列宁，在新的历史条件下创造性地发展了马克思主义，得出了如下的结论：如果不创立一个新型的战斗的革命政党，就不能推翻帝国主义，无产阶级——现代最先进的革命阶级——也不能夺取政权。只有这种政党才具有引导无产阶级夺取政权的大无畏的精神，才具有能理解革命形势的复杂条件的丰富经验，才能非常机敏地绕过通达目的地的道路上的各种暗礁。在反对马克思主义的公开的和暗藏的敌人和反对工人运动中各种机会主义的斗争中，列宁奠定了并保卫了新型政党——布尔什维克党——的理论的、组织的和实践的基础。列宁的忠实的学生和战友约·维·斯大林和列宁一起建立了并巩固了党。
    苏联共产党曾走过了一条光荣的、有半个世纪之久的发展道路，这条道路是从十九世纪八十年代在俄国开端的不大的马克思主义小组到现在已发展成苏联社会的领导和主导力量，成为拥有七百万党员的强大政党。
    列宁争取新型的马克思主义政党的斗争，开始于国际工人运动的转捩点。这时资本主义步入了自己发展的最后的阶段——帝国主义阶段，无产阶级争取推翻资本主义、建立无产阶级专政和争取社会主义的直接战斗的时代已经来到了。
    这个时期，俄国是帝国主义矛盾的集合点，是各种压迫——资本主义压迫、殖民地压迫、军事压迫——的策源地。在国内，工人阶级所领导的资产阶级民主革命酝酿成熟了。国际革命运动的中心转移到俄国。
    俄国无产阶级最重要的政治任务，就是推翻沙皇专制制度—世界反动派的堡垒。为了顺利地完成俄国无产阶级的这个历史性的使命，就需要一个能够带领无产阶级战胜沙皇制度、俄国资产阶级和地主的战斗的革命政党。这个政党不能是西欧型的一般的社会民主党，西欧的社会民主党是机会主义者的尾巴，幻想“社会改良”和害怕社会主义革命。
    由工人运动中产生出来的俄国的革命的无产阶级政党的最早幼芽，就是彼得堡的“工人阶级解放斗争协会”，这个协会是列宁在一八九五年所创建的。在列宁的领导下，“斗争协会”第一次在俄国把社会主义和工人运动结合起来。
    一八九八年，召开了俄国社会民主工党第一次代表大会，这个代表大会宣告了俄国的马克思主义政党的成立。但是代表大会没有把零散的社会民主党小组联合成一个统一的集中的组织，没有规定出党纲和党章。代表大会选出来的党中央委员会很快地就被沙皇政府逮捕了。各地的社会民主党组织在思想上仍处于涣散状态，机会主义的倾向——否认工人阶级的政治斗争及其在革命运动中的领导作用的“经济主义”猖獗起来了。列宁为了克服这种涣散状态，克服机会主义的动摇和准备建立党，曾紧张地工作了若干年。
    在一九○三年七月的俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会上，创立了革命的马克思主义的政党，当时俄国正站在资产阶级民主革命的门口，而且俄国无产阶级已成为世界革命运动的先锋队。
    为列宁所组织的和领导的全俄的马克思主义的政治性报纸“火星报”，对俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会的思想上和组织上的准备，起了决定性的作用，为列宁的“火星报”所制订的党纲和组织原则，在俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会上获得了全胜。党的代表大会推翻了机会主义的一切修正案，批准了“火星报”所提出来的党纲。党纲规定的中心任务是争取无产阶级专政的斗争，党纲包括了对农民问题的革命的民主的要求，也载有关于民族自决权的条款。为俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会所通过的列宁的纲领，成为俄国工人阶级争取政权的伟大旗帜，而代表大会本身就是世界工人运动的转捩点。
    列宁的经典著作“做什么？”、“进一步，退两步”、“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”、“唯物论与经验批判论”等著作，对于俄国马克思主义政党的建立有极重大的意义。在这些天才的著作中，列宁制定了党在思想上和组织上的不可动摇的基础，制定了党的策略和理论原则。列宁的最伟大的功绩是，他在自己的著作中发展了在资产阶级民主革命中无产阶级的领导权的思想，并指出在当时的历史情况下，建立工农联盟以保证无产阶级的领导，是革命胜利的必要条件。俄国工人阶级以列宁的无产阶级革命理论为指南，运用列宁制定的革命策略，同贫苦农民建立联盟，于一九一七年十月（俄历）推翻了资产阶级政权，建立了真正的人民政权——苏维埃政权。这样就突破了世界帝国主义的锁链，并建立了世界上第一个苏维埃社会主义国家。
    俄国伟大十月社会主义革命在人类历史上开辟了新的纪元，资本主义崩溃和社会主义胜利的纪元。十月革命的胜利是列宁的无产阶级革命理论的凯旋，同时苏联共产党已由一个国家的力量变成了国际的力量，变成了世界革命和工人运动的“突击队”。
    共产党在同国内外反革命分子进行残酷斗争中保卫住无产阶级专政后，在粉碎了国外干涉者和白卫军分子以后，就为实现列宁的社会主义建设计划展开了巨大的工作。列宁在对帝国主义的矛盾进行深刻的马克思主义的分析的基础上得出了一个天才的结论，这就是社会主义可能首先在几个国家，甚至在个别国家取得胜利。他指出，在我们苏维埃国家中，在无产阶级专政的条件下，具有一切必要条件来建设社会主义。
    在列宁逝世以后，以列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林为首的苏联共产党，粉碎了企图使党离开列宁路线走向资本主义复辟道路的托洛茨基—布哈林分子和其他一些叛徒的阴谋，保卫了列宁主义，并采取了在苏联建设社会主义的坚定方针。同时，党在建设社会主义中是以社会经济发展的客观法则、社会物质生活发展的成熟要求和人民的利益为出发点的。
    苏联人民在共产党领导下，依靠苏维埃制度，在战前几个五年计划的年代中建立了第一等的工业和巨大的社会主义农业。由于国家工业化和农业集体化计划的实现，苏维埃国家向前跃进了一大步，从一个落后国家变成一个先进国家，从一个农业国变成了一个强大的工业和集体农庄制的社会主义强国。苏联已彻底消灭了剥削阶级和人剥削人的现象，永远地消灭了危机、失业现象和劳动群众的贫穷。我国已为不断提高劳动人民的物质生活和文化生活水平建立了各种条件。
    共产党所领导的苏联人民在人类史上首先建成了新的社会制度——社会主义。
    社会主义在苏联的胜利，已由苏联宪法用立法的形式巩固下来。这个宪法反映了世界上最民主的制度。苏联共产党实行了解决民族问题的无产阶级的方法，确立了我国各民族和部族的一律平等，努力克服了以前俄国各被压迫民族的经济和文化的落后现象，把一切民族都团结于一个统一的兄弟的大家庭中，从而建立了强大的多民族的社会主义国家。
    党和苏联政府实现了最深刻的文化革命，使苏联变成了没有文盲的国度，成为进步文化和科学的中心。苏维埃国家精神上和政治上的一致、各族人民的友谊和苏维埃爱国主义等巨大动力，在苏联社会主义的基础上发展了和巩固了。
    由于共产党的英明领导，苏联人民在伟大的卫国战争时期击败了德国法西斯和日本帝国主义，取得了有世界历史意义的胜利。战争又一次雄辩地证明了社会主义制度的伟大优越性及其无穷无尽的生命力，证明了苏维埃国家的不可战胜的威力。苏联人民用忘我的斗争不仅保卫了自己的自由和独立，而且将欧亚两洲人民从法西斯奴役的威胁中拯救出来。由于苏联军队的英雄的胜利，欧洲和亚洲的许多国家脱离了资本主义体系，确立了人民民主制度。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚等国人民，已经挣脱了帝国主义的桎梏，建立了履行无产阶级专政职责的人民民主制度，目前并在顺利地建设社会主义。中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，对于帝国主义体系是一个特别有力的打击。
    一九五二年十月召开的苏联共产党第十九次代表大会，给苏联人民的斗争和胜利作出了辉煌的总结，规定了苏维埃国家向共产主义继续前进的道路。一九五三年九月召开的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议，决定了一些实际措施，来进一步发展农业的一切部门，扩大农产品的生产，提高劳动人民的物质福利。
    苏联共产党在半世纪以来的争取劳动人民的自由和幸福的英勇斗争中，赢得了苏联人民的无限热爱和信赖。苏联人民称共产党为自己热爱的党，他们看到党的政策反映了自己的切身利益，反映了自己的愿望和理想，因而一致地支持党的一切倡议，积极地为实现党的政策而斗争。共产党在自己的全部活动中依靠着千百万劳动群众的创造的积极性。劳动群众是历史的真正创造者，是一切物质财富的创造者。
    共产党和苏维埃国家的缔造者与领袖列宁一再指出，党之所以坚强有力和不可战胜，就是由于它与群众的密切联系。列宁教导党不要满足于已得的成就，要经常用批判的态度对待自己的工作，揭露并坚决地铲除自己工作中的缺点。批评与自我批评是教育干部的特殊的共产主义的方法，是党的经常有效的武器。
    共产党不断地增强苏维埃国家的政治和经济威力，巩固着工人阶级与集体农民的联盟，巩固着苏联各族人民兄弟般的合作和友谊。党经常关怀着自己队伍的巩固和统一，与被粉碎了的反列宁主义集团的残余，与一切对于马克思列宁主义的曲解，与资产阶级思想的表现，进行着不调和的斗争，为克服人们思想意识中还未肃清的资本主义遗毒而坚强地工作着。
    共产党以战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说为自己一切活动的指针。马克思列宁主义理论的力量，在于它使我们能够正确地判明局势，能了解事变的内在联系，不仅能察知事变在目前怎样发展和向何处发展，而且能察知事变在将来会怎样发展和向何处发展。马克思列宁主义理论是工人阶级和全体劳动人民的根本利益的科学反映，是为革命地改造社会而斗争的强有力的思想武器。
    党和苏联政府根据列宁斯大林关于两种对立的社会制度可以和平共处的原理，始终一贯地执行着维护并巩固和平的政策，执行着与一切国家在相互间的利益得到尊重的原则下扩展事务联系的政策。
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下，在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的百战百胜的学说的鼓舞下，正勇往直前地向共产主义建设的新的胜利迈进。
