Gongxiao Cooperative of Minquan Village, Yushu County, Jilin Province, Earnestly Improves Production Materials Supply Work After Studying the General Line
    The Gongxiao Cooperative of Minquan Village, Yushu County, Jilin Province, covers three administrative villages with 1,500 peasant households. In recent years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the majority of local peasants have joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations, gradually expanded production, and greatly increased the demand for production materials. However, the Gongxiao Cooperative did not understand the needs of the peasants well and failed to supply them in a timely manner, which affected the peasants' production.
    In the fourth quarter of last year, the cadres of the Minquan Village Gongxiao Cooperative studied the general line for the transition period of the state, clarified the tasks of the Gongxiao Cooperative, and discovered the shortcomings in their past work. They then actively studied and improved the production materials supply work.
    In December last year, the Minquan Village Gongxiao Cooperative invited the Chinese Communist Party branch secretaries, village chiefs, agricultural production cooperative directors, mutual aid team leaders, and experienced old farmers from the three villages to hold discussion meetings to solicit their opinions on the supply of production materials for spring plowing in 1954. They also brought the existing small farm tools for everyone to study. The attending cadres and peasants put forward opinions on the specifications and quality of more than 30 kinds of commodities such as plowshares, hoes, and iron shovels, and suggested that the cooperative operate 12 kinds of new commodities such as flower wheel carts, rubber wheel cart tubes, and hoe handles. In order to do this work better, they also brought the cooperative member's democratic forces into play, and organized a production materials supply committee with the participation of agricultural production cooperative directors, mutual aid team leaders, and old farmers to regularly study production materials supply issues.
    At present, the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have successively submitted plans to the Gongxiao Cooperative for the purchase of production materials. The Gongxiao Cooperative is entrusting nearby handicraft production cooperatives and handicraftsmen to process and order goods according to the needs of the peasants. In order to ensure that the processed products truly meet the needs of the peasants, the Gongxiao Cooperative first takes the samples of the products back to solicit the opinions of the peasants, and then entrusts them to manufacture in large quantities.

    吉林省榆树县民权村供销合作社
    学习总路线后认真改进生产资料供应工作
    吉林省榆树县民权村供销合作社，业务范围包括三个行政村，有一千五百户农民。几年来，当地农民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，大部参加了互助合作组织，逐步扩大了生产，需要生产资料的数量大为增加。但是供销合作社没有很好地去了解农民的需要，及时地进行供应，以致影响了农民的生产。
    去年第四季度，民权村供销合作社的干部学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，明确认识了供销合作社的任务，发现了过去工作中的缺点。他们便积极研究改进了生产资料供应工作。
    去年十二月间，民权村供销合作社分别邀请三个村的中共支部书记、村长、农业生产合作社主任、互助组长及有生产经验的老农等举行了座谈会，征求他们对一九五四年春耕生产资料供应工作的意见，并把现有的小农具拿来让大家研究。到会干部、农民对犁铧、镐头、铁锹等三十多种商品的规格、质量等提出了意见，并建议合作社经营花轮车、胶轮车带、镐把等十二种新商品。为了使这一工作作得更好，他们还发挥社员民主力量，组织了一个有农业生产合作社主任、互助组长和老农等参加的供应生产资料委员会，定期研究生产资料供应问题。
    目前，各农业生产合作社和互助组纷纷向供销合作社提出了购买生产资料的计划。该供销合作社正根据农民的要求，向附近的手工业生产合作社和手工业者委托加工、订货。为了使加工的产品真正合乎农民的需要，供销合作社还先将产品的样品拿回征求农民的意见，然后委托大量制造。
