    The Delayed Passenger Train
    By Our Correspondent Chen Ji
    On December 23, 1953, the Tianjin Railway Station announced to passengers: a temporary passenger train would depart from Tianjin for Yanzhou at 12:30 tonight. Many passengers bought their tickets and arrived at the station early, waiting to board. But when 12:30 arrived, there was no sign of the train. The passengers were puzzled and anxiously inquired about the train's whereabouts.
    "The time has passed, why hasn't the train arrived?"
    "The train is still in the depot, not yet coupled."
    "When will it be coupled?"
    "Probably another hour." The passengers, with their luggage, crowded into the waiting room, waiting patiently. An hour passed, but still nothing. Some passengers became anxious and angrily asked the station staff:
    "Is this train actually going to leave or not?"
    "It will!" the staff member replied.
    "When exactly will it leave?"
    "Hard to say. Probably another two hours..."
    The passengers shouted in dissatisfaction. Some children cried loudly. Some elderly people and women put their luggage on the ground and lay down on it. Several young cadres murmured among themselves: "What to do? I'm afraid we'll miss tomorrow's meeting. I think we should take another train!" Saying this, they left the passenger line. Another two hours passed, and it was already four in the morning. The biting cold wind whistled into the waiting room. The temporary passenger train had still not entered the station. "Oh, what bad luck! How long do we have to wait?" A sigh came from the passenger line. At this time, the station staff slowly announced: "Attention passengers! The train to Yanzhou will depart at 5:30. Passengers, prepare to board." Five hours late, the train finally entered the station.
    Why was this train delayed by five hours? Yang Lin, the dispatcher at the Tianjin Railway Transportation Branch Dispatching Office, said: "Our dispatching office notified the Tianjin Railway Station Operations Office long ago to couple the train on time. But they didn't seize the time..." Li Runde, the duty stationmaster of the Station Operations Office, said: "We are too busy to handle everything, where do we have the time? The dispatching office doesn't understand our situation and never comes to see us here..." Both sides have their "reasons", but the train was delayed by five hours.
    This is just one example of many passenger train delays! The Ministry of Railways has long stipulated: passenger trains are not allowed to wait for freight trains. But Tianjin Station, regardless of whether the passenger train is delayed or not, insists on making passenger trains wait for freight trains, thus causing many passenger train delays. On November 28, Passenger Train No. 226 from Dezhou to Tianjin had already arrived at Caozhuang Station, only a dozen li away from Tianjin, but because it had to wait for Freight Train No. 4931, it had to stop and wait for an hour before heading to Tianjin. On the same day, the passenger train from Tianjin to Shanghai began waiting for Freight Train No. 4931 as soon as it left Tianjin Station, unable to proceed according to the train schedule, stopping at every station, and arriving in Dezhou more than an hour late. This kind of delayed passenger train occurs almost every day on the railway near Tianjin. In the second half of November, an average of nine out of ten passenger trains of the Tianjin Railway Transportation Branch were delayed. On some days, all passenger trains were delayed. Passenger Train No. 115 from Tianjin to Shanghai is often delayed, sometimes by three or four hours. When passengers in Shanghai mention Passenger Train No. 115, they say: it's a truly "ya ya wu" (meaning very terrible) train.
    When will this phenomenon of passenger train delays be eliminated? People are eagerly awaiting a response from the Tianjin Railway Bureau.

    迟到的客车
    本报记者　陈迹
    一九五三年十二月二十三日，天津车站向旅客宣布：准于今晚十二点半钟，从天津开出一次临时客车，去兖州。许多旅客买好车票，提早来到车站，等候上车。等到十二点半钟，还看不见这趟客车的影子。旅客们很奇怪，焦急地探问这趟客车的下落。
    “时间都过了，为什么车还不来？”
    “车子还在车库里，没有挂好。”
    “几时挂好呀？”
    “大概还得等一个钟头。”旅客们拿着行李，挤在候车室，耐心地等待着。过了一个钟头，仍然不见动静。有些旅客急坏了，气忿地问车站服务员：
    “这趟客车，究竟开不开？”
    “开！”服务员回答。
    “到底什么时候开呢？”
    “说不定。大概还要过两个钟头……”
    旅客们不满意地叫喊着。有些小孩哇哇地哭。有些老人和妇女把行李放在地上，仰卧在上面。几个年轻的干部唧唧咕咕地商量：“怎么办？恐怕赶不上明天的会议罗。我看，还是乘另外一趟车吧！”说着，离开了旅客的队伍。又过了两个多钟头，已经是早晨四点了。刺骨的寒风，呼呼地吹进候车室。那趟临时客车还没有开进车站。“唉，真倒楣！等到那一天呢？”从旅客的队伍里传出叹息的声音。这时候，车站人员才慢吞吞地报告：“请旅客们注意！到兖州去的客车，在五点半钟开。旅客们准备上车。”迟了五个钟头，这趟客车才算进了车站。
    为什么这趟客车晚开五个钟头呢？天津铁路运输分局调度所调度员杨霖说：“我们调度所早就通知天津车站运转室，要他们按时挂好这趟车。但他们不抓紧时间……”车站运转室值班站长李润德说：“我们忙都忙不过来，那来时间呀？调度所不了解我们的情况，也从不到我们这儿看看。……”双方都有“理由”，这趟客车却晚开了五个钟头。
    这只不过是许多次客车晚点的一个例子罢了！铁道部早就规定：不许客车等待货车。但天津车站不管客车晚点不晚点，偏偏要客车等待货车，因而使许多次客车晚点。十一月二十八日，从德州到天津的二二六次客车，已经开到离天津只有十多里的曹庄车站，因为要等四九三一次货车，只好停下来，停了一个钟头，才开往天津。同一天，从天津开往上海的客车，一走出天津车站，就开始等四九三一次货车，不能按照火车时刻表前进，走一站停一站，走到德州，晚了一个多钟头。这种迟到的客车，在天津附近的铁路上几乎天天都有。十一月下半月，天津铁路运输分局平均十趟客车，就有九趟客车是迟到的。有几天，所有的客车都是迟到的。从天津到上海的一
  一五次客车，常常晚点，有时晚三、四个钟头。上海的旅客一提起一一五次客车，就说：真是
  “呀呀唔”（很糟糕的意思）客车。
    什么时候才能消灭这种客车迟到的现象呢？人们都在殷切地盼望着天津铁路局的答复。
