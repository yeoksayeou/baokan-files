    Basic Experiences of the Mutual Aid Group Leadership in Keshan County, Heilongjiang
    Sun Gang
    The mutual aid and cooperation movement in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, has had several years of foundation. During the Party rectification in the winter of 1952 and the spring of 1953, the county repeatedly educated farmers on the direction of rural economic development. In particular, during various production activities in 1953, the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" was conscientiously implemented, and the principle of "active leadership, steady progress" was followed. As a result, the mutual aid groups in the county were further consolidated and developed in 1953, fundamentally changing the past phenomenon of "spring planting, summer scattering, and autumn collapse." In 1953, the mutual aid groups in the county were finalized earlier, the number of participating households increased, the number of groups decreased, the organizational form improved, the number of permanent groups increased, and the number of temporary seasonal groups decreased. In 1952, the number of households organized accounted for more than 91% of the total number of farm households in the county, and in 1953, it accounted for about 95%. In 1952, permanent groups accounted for 31.88% of the total number of mutual aid groups in the county, and in 1953, permanent groups accounted for 41.28%. At the same time, the content of the mutual aid groups was also enriched. Most mutual aid groups formulated production plans on a seasonal and segmental basis, and 36% of the county's mutual aid groups also formulated permanent production increase plans. Due to the advantages of being organized, agricultural production was guaranteed to proceed smoothly in 1953 despite the heavy disasters and many difficulties, production technology was improved, and the annual agricultural production tasks were completed.
       In leading the work of mutual aid groups, we have gained the following basic experiences:
      1. Solve the main problems in the production of mutual aid groups according to different production seasons. During the preparation for spring plowing after the Party rectification, we found that some people did not understand the Party's policies and had a somewhat vague understanding of the direction of organizational development; some relatively wealthy farmers did not dare to develop production, believing that "the Communist Party likes the poor and dislikes the rich" and that "everything will be lumped together in socialism." The main reason for these vague ideas was the lack of comprehensive policy education for cadres and the masses during the Party rectification. In addition, some mutual aid groups in the past did not grasp the mutually beneficial policies well, which also created some illusions for the masses. Based on this situation, the county party committee organized more than 100 cadres to go to the countryside, combined with the preparation for spring plowing and spring plowing production, to provide policy supplementary lessons to farmers and universally went deep into the groups to help solve specific problems, further improving farmers' understanding of "organizing to develop production" and increasing farmers' enthusiasm for production. On this basis, mutual aid groups were universally mobilized and helped to improve agricultural technology and promote the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience. 1,542 mutual aid groups in the county formulated plans to promote the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience. During spring plowing, each district and village cultivated 956 key groups to promote the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience; the mutual aid groups in the county basically learned and applied the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience.
    In 1953, the situation of summer weeding was characterized by heavy rain, barren land, and simultaneous growth of grass and seedlings, which generally led to a relative shortage of labor. Contradictions between doing work earlier and later within the mutual aid groups were relatively prominent. Therefore, during the summer weeding, all efforts were concentrated on solving the rotation problem within the mutual aid groups, and various rotation methods that satisfied the masses were promoted. The principle was: no matter what form is adopted, as long as it is discussed democratically by the whole group, the members have no objections, it is conducive to production, it does not leave land barren, it rotates quickly, and it rotates reasonably, it is good. Generally, mutual aid groups can take into account "barren and clean land, large and small seedlings" in terms of labor allocation and wage assessment and make some differences. In this way, the contradiction of rotation before and after the rain in the mutual aid group was resolved, and the labor efficiency was improved.
    During the hanging up of farm tools and the autumn harvest, according to the characteristics of busy production, fragmented and complex work, and different ripening periods of crops, the focus was on solving the problems of organizing and allocating labor and animal power in the mutual aid groups. A few mutual aid groups adopted the method of assigning special personnel to be responsible for the whole work and ensuring quality and quantity, while most mutual aid groups adopted the methods of unified leadership, helping each other, and dividing large groups into small groups to flexibly allocate labor and animal power according to the needs of the work. Without affecting the main production of the whole group, members were allowed to do odd jobs at home. At the same time, women and semi-laborers were mobilized to participate in field production according to the actual situation, which solved the difficulties of tight time, busy production, and insufficient labor, and ensured the completion of the production tasks.
    2. Implement mutually beneficial policies by solving specific problems within the group. In 1952, because some mutual aid groups did not implement the mutually beneficial policies well, the production enthusiasm of some farmers was affected. In 1953, this lesson was learned, and the mutually beneficial policies were implemented through policy supplementary lessons, various meetings, and training classes for mutual aid group leaders; the policies were also embodied by solving specific problems within the mutual aid groups. All localities determined wage standards according to the actual situation and made appropriate adjustments according to the different production conditions in each season. For example, summer weeding in 1953 was relatively difficult, so human wages were relatively high. At the same time, attention was also paid to equal pay for equal work between men and women and consistent wages inside and outside the group. Horses and large carts also determined appropriate wages according to the quality, load, and size. Most mutual aid groups were able to settle work accounts on a seasonal and segmental basis; they recorded clearly and returned them in a timely manner. Due to the implementation of mutually beneficial policies, the enthusiasm of farmers to expand production was increased. After the wheat harvest, many farmers in the county added carts and bought horses, and the mutual aid groups were further consolidated. When solving the problem of mutual benefit, we must not ignore the education of mutual aid and unity, and prevent excessive and trivial "dead reckoning" from hindering unity.
    3. District and village cadres should strengthen specific leadership over mutual aid groups and improve the leadership level of group leaders. After studying the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" and other documents, the work style of district and village cadres began to change somewhat, especially the specific leadership over mutual aid groups was strengthened. District cadres adopted the method of "studying one by one, mastering them by category, promoting organization, focusing on assistance, solving problems, and checking effectiveness" in the village to lead the mutual aid groups; some village cadres in some villages also used the method of "participating in production, leading production, and implementing division of labor and contracting for mutual aid groups" to go deep into the groups to solve specific problems. A small number of village cadres also adopted the method of cultivating key group typical demonstrations, which had a great educational impact on farmers.
    In order to improve the leadership level of mutual aid group leaders, we implemented the method of training mutual aid group leaders and village cadres who specifically lead mutual aid groups on a seasonal basis. In 1953, more than 4,700 people were trained during the preparation for spring plowing; more than 4,000 mutual aid group leaders were trained before summer weeding and hanging up of farm tools. Through training, the understanding of organization among group leaders and village cadres was further improved, the sense of responsibility was strengthened, and the experience and methods of leading mutual aid groups were exchanged. Now some mutual aid group leaders have initially strengthened planning, relied on group members, promoted democracy, handled affairs impartially, and took the lead in setting an example.

    黑龙江克山县领导互助组的基本经验
    孙钢
    黑龙江省克山县的互助合作运动已有了几年的基础，一九五二年冬天和一九五三年春天整党时，全县各地又反复向农民进行了农村经济发展方向的教育，特别是在一九五三年各项生产活动中，认真地贯彻了“中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议”，执行了“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，因而一九五三年全县互助组有了进一步的巩固和发展，基本上改变了过去“春插、夏散、秋垮台”的现象。一九五三年全县互助组定型较早，参加的户数增多，组数减少了，组织形式提高了，常年组增多，临时季节组减少了。一九五二年全县组织起来的户数占全县总农户百分之九十一强，一九五三年就占百分之九十五左右；一九五二年常年组占全县互助组总数的百分之三十一点八八，一九五三年常年组占了百分之四十一点二八。同时互助组的内容也丰富了，大部分互助组按季、按段地制订了生产计划，全县有百分之三十六的互助组还订了常年增产计划。由于发挥了组织起来的优越性，在一九五三年灾害重、困难多的情况下，保证了农业生产的顺利进行，改进了生产技术，完成了全年的农业生产任务。
       在领导互助组的工作中，我们得到以下几点基本经验：
      一、根据生产季节的不同，解决互助组生产中的主要问题。在整党后准备春耕时，我们发现了部分群众对党的政策不摸底，对组织起来发展方向的认识有些模糊；有些较富裕的农民不敢发展生产，认为“共产党喜穷不喜富”“到社会（主义）归大堆”。产生这些模糊思想的主要原因是整党中对干部和群众缺乏全面的政策教育，加以过去有部分互助组没掌握好互利政策，也使群众产生了一些错觉。根据这个情况，县委组织了一百多名干部下乡，结合准备春耕和春耕生产，向农民进行了政策补课，并普遍深入小组帮助解决具体问题，进一步提高了农民对“组织起来发展生产”的认识，提高了农民的生产积极性。在这个基础上，普遍发动和帮助互助组改进农业技术，推广了肇源丰产经验。全县有一千五百四十二个互助组制订了推广肇源丰产经验计划。春耕时，各区村共培养了九百五十六个推广肇源丰产经验的重点组；全县互助组基本上都学习并运用了肇源丰产经验。
    一九五三年夏锄的情况是雨多地荒，草苗齐长，相对地普遍感到劳力不足，互助组内做活先后矛盾比较突出。因此，在夏锄时就集中全力解决互助组内的轮作问题，推行了群众满意的多种多样的轮作方法。原则是：不论采取什么形式，只要经过全组民主讨论，组员没意见，有利于生产，不撩荒土地，轮得快，轮得合理，就是好的。一般互助组在劳力调配和工资评定方面，都能照顾到“地荒地净、苗大苗小”而有所不同。这样解决了互助组里雨前雨后轮作的矛盾，提高了劳动效率。
    在挂锄和秋收时期，根据生产忙、活计零碎复杂和庄稼成熟期不一的特点，在互助组中着重解决组织和调配劳力、畜力问题。少数互助组采取整活专人负责、保质保量的办法，多数互助组采取统一领导、分帮干活和大组分小帮等办法，根据活计需要，灵活调配劳力畜力。在不影响全组主要生产的情况下，允许组员自家干零活。同时，发动妇女和半劳力根据实际情况，参加田间生产，解决了时间紧、生产忙、劳力不足的困难，保证了生产任务的完成。
    二、通过解决组内具体问题贯彻互利政策。一九五二年因为有些互助组没有很好地贯彻互利政策，影响了部分农民的生产积极性。一九五三年接受了这个教训，通过政策补课、各种会议及互助组长训练班，贯彻了互利政策；并通过解决互助组内的具体问题，体现政策。各地都根据实际情况，评定了工资标准，并按照各季节生产情况的不同进行适当调整。如一九五三年夏锄比较困难，人力工资也就较高。同时，还注意到男女同劳同酬和组内组外工资一致。马和大车也根据质量好坏、载重多少分别确定了适当的工资。大多数互助组都作到了按季按段结清工账；记的清楚，还的及时。由于贯彻了互利政策，提高了农民扩大生产的积极性，麦收以后，全县有不少农民添车买马，互助组也更巩固了。在解决互利问题时，也不可忽视互助团结的教育，防止过分琐碎地“死扣”，妨碍团结。
    三、区村干部加强对互助组的具体领导，提高组长的领导水平。学习中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议等文件以后，区村干部作风开始有些转变，特别是加强了对互助组的具体领导。区干部在村里对互助组采取“逐个研究，分类掌握，推动组织，重点帮助，解决问题，检查实效”的办法进行领导；有些村子里的村干部也用“参加生产、领导生产、对互助组实行分工包干”的方法，深入小组解决具体问题。还有少数村干部采用了培养重点组典型示范的方法，对农民的教育和影响也很大。
    为了提高互助组长的领导水平，我们实行了按季训练互助组长和具体领导互助组的村干部的办法。一九五三年准备春耕时训练了四千七百多人；夏锄前挂锄时各训练了互助组长四千多人。通过训练，进一步提高了组长和村干部对组织起来的认识，加强了责任心，交流了领导互助组的经验和方法。现在有些互助组长已初步做到加强计划性，依靠组员，发扬民主，办事大公无私，带头作样子。
