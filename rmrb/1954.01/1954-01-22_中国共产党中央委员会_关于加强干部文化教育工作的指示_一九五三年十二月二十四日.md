The large-scale cultivation and promotion of worker-peasant cadres, and the planned improvement of their political, cultural, and professional levels, to make them the backbone of various construction undertakings, is a major political and organizational task in implementing the Party's general line during the transition period. In recent years, cadre cultural education work has achieved certain successes, but at present, a large number of worker-peasant cadres still have low cultural levels, which hinders the improvement of their political understanding and professional abilities, making them feel incompetent in the face of new national construction tasks. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must pay great attention to the cultural education of cadres and strengthen its leadership. In order to effectively carry out this work, effectively improve the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres, and adapt to the needs of national construction, the following instructions are hereby issued:

(1) The current purpose of carrying out cultural education for cadres is to gradually raise the cultural level of cadres with lower education to the equivalent of higher elementary and even junior high school graduates, so as to effectively study political theory, delve into professional work, and complete various work tasks; at the same time, to enable some worker-peasant cadres to be qualified for further education. Party and government organs and people's organizations at all levels should mobilize and organize cadres who have not graduated from junior high school to study culture as much as possible, and their academic performance should be used as one of the criteria for cadre assessment and performance evaluation.

(2) When carrying out cultural education for cadres, emphasis should be placed on attracting worker-peasant cadres who shoulder certain leadership responsibilities to participate in learning, while also appropriately paying attention to organizing guards, messengers, service personnel, etc. to enroll. It is wrong to adopt an indifferent attitude towards the urgent learning needs of guards and service personnel and not to give them the opportunity to learn culture; this should be corrected.

(3) Cadre cultural education must adopt a rapid and practical teaching approach. The curriculum should be streamlined and focused, the teaching content should be appropriately related to the work of the students, and the teaching methods should be suitable for the characteristics of worker-peasant cadres. It is wrong to mechanically apply the set of ordinary schools in teaching, regardless of the characteristics and practical requirements of worker-peasant cadres, or to seek speed without quality; this should be prevented and corrected.

(4) Cadre cultural learning should be conducted in spare time or in concentrated full-time study, depending on the specific circumstances. Since most worker-peasant cadres cannot completely leave their jobs for study, the study of general cadres should be mainly part-time.

(5) Organs at or above the county level should, according to specific conditions, open spare-time cultural supplementary schools or cultural supplementary classes for cadres in a planned manner. Party and government leaders of the organs should always care about this and give it due support, and also designate special personnel to be responsible for helping solve certain problems, such as guiding the school to formulate teaching plans, ensuring the time for cadres to study culture, and promptly solving the necessary funds and classrooms for the school; and it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of teachers and students, so that teachers can work with peace of mind, students respect teachers and study hard, and teachers and students unite to complete the teaching tasks together.

The following are general provisions regarding the school system, curriculum, teaching time, teachers, and systems of spare-time cultural supplementary schools or cultural supplementary classes for cadres. All localities may refer to them for implementation according to actual conditions.

　　(1) School system: Higher elementary class about two years (excluding the literacy stage), junior high class about three years. Individual places and units with conditions may focus on piloting senior high school classes and night universities.

　　(2) Curriculum: Higher elementary class sets up two subjects: Chinese language and arithmetic. Places that cannot temporarily set up junior high school classes may add natural knowledge. Junior high school classes can generally set up five subjects: Chinese language, algebra, history, geography, and natural knowledge; if it is necessary to learn other courses (such as geometry, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and hygiene, etc.) due to work needs, elective classes can be opened. The above courses can be appropriately increased or decreased by various localities according to different objects and different requirements. The arrangement of courses should be based on single-course entry or two-course simultaneous entry.

　　(3) Teaching time: Each year is divided into two semesters, and the teaching time for each semester should be guaranteed for 20 weeks; the weekly class time should generally be no less than six hours. The teaching time for each subject can be roughly set as: 240 hours for each of Chinese language and arithmetic in higher elementary school (480 hours in total); 300 hours for Chinese language in junior high school, 120 hours for algebra, 100 hours for history, 80 hours for geography, and 120 hours for nature (720 hours in total). All localities can flexibly grasp this according to specific conditions.

　　(4) Spare-time cultural supplementary schools or cultural supplementary classes for cadres must hire part-time teachers from among the staff of organs and groups to teach, and appropriately equip a certain number of full-time teachers as the backbone of teaching and manage teaching work. For part-time teachers, their original work may be appropriately reduced or subsidies may be given as appropriate when necessary. It is inappropriate to think that only full-time teachers are useful and to deny the role of part-time teachers. In order to improve teaching effectiveness, teachers should be appropriately organized to carry out professional learning.

　　(5) Spare-time cultural supplementary schools or cultural supplementary classes for cadres should divide students into classes according to their existing cultural level, so as to avoid too much disparity in the cultural level of students in the same subject. At the same time, it is necessary to gradually establish systems for leave of absence, make-up classes, promotion, examinations, and graduation to ensure the normal progress of teaching work.

(6) Rural district cadres, except for district Party committee secretaries and district heads, generally focus on spare-time learning. And refer to the above-mentioned various methods of spare-time cultural supplementary schools, combined with local specific conditions, take various ways to learn.

(7) Since the main cadres above the district Party committee secretary and district head have heavy work tasks and high mobility, it is difficult to persist in systematic cultural learning in spare time. Therefore, Party committees at or above the prefectural level should gradually establish cadre cultural supplementary schools, or attach cadre cultural supplementary classes to Party schools and other cadre schools, and systematically and in batches transfer old cadres with low cultural levels to leave their jobs for concentrated learning. For those cadres with low cultural levels who are about to transfer to industrial departments, they should be transferred to leave their jobs for learning as soon as possible. Party and government leading organs at all levels must strengthen the leadership of such schools, often give specific help, be responsible for reviewing and approving the school's teaching policies and plans, equip strong leading backbones and a certain number of full-time cadres and teachers, and at the same time transfer cadres to school in accordance with the prescribed conditions. The school system, curriculum, teaching time, and other issues of such schools can be determined by various localities themselves with reference to the various methods of spare-time cultural supplementary schools for cadres.

(8) Worker-peasant accelerated elementary schools currently led by education administrative departments at all levels should be uniformly changed to cadre cultural supplementary schools or cadre cultural supplementary classes attached to Party schools from January 1954, and handed over to the direct leadership of the local Party committee, and should be rectified in a practical manner. Such as establishing various necessary systems to overcome chaos; revising teaching plans; adjusting unqualified teachers; and properly resettling students who do not meet the conditions and are weak and unable to persist in learning.

(9) In order to adapt to the needs of national construction work, efforts should be made to eliminate illiteracy among worker-peasant cadres. In addition to the general adoption of spare-time learning methods, in areas with conditions, county or prefectural offices should organize accelerated literacy classes and systematically transfer illiterate and semi-illiterate cadres at the county and district levels to enroll; generally, strive to reach the level of being able to recognize about 2,000 commonly used characters, read popular books and newspapers, and write short essays of 200 to 300 words within three to four months (about 500 hours of actual teaching). At the same time, attention should be paid to teaching and consolidating at the same time in teaching to prevent the tendency of simply rushing for time and speed without success.

(10) Planned improvement of the cultural level of cadres in industrial and mining enterprises is of great significance for promoting national industrial construction. Party committees and responsible business departments at all levels should pay great attention to this and strengthen the leadership of this work, formulate practical plans, and appropriately solve problems such as learning time, staffing, and funding.

(11) Compiling a set of textbooks suitable for cultural learning by worker-peasant cadres is one of the keys to running cadre cultural education well. The Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council should cooperate with the cultural committees of various localities to organize a certain force to carry out this work in a planned and step-by-step manner. At present, we should first collect and review existing textbooks in various localities and select the better ones to recommend to various localities to meet urgent needs.

(12) In principle, cadres of ethnic minorities should use their own national language for cultural learning, but under the principle of voluntariness, they can also adopt other languages commonly used in local social life; their school system, curriculum, and teaching time, etc., shall be handled with reference to the above provisions according to specific circumstances.

(13) The establishment and funding of cadre cultural education undertakings are temporarily stipulated as follows:

First, the establishment and funding of spare-time cultural education undertakings for cadres: 1. The staffing of full-time cadres and teachers in spare-time cultural supplementary schools (including spare-time literacy classes for cadres) can generally be equipped with one full-time teacher for every 100 students and one full-time cadre for every 300 students. Localities can appropriately grasp this according to specific circumstances. When more part-time teachers can be hired to teach, full-time teachers should be set up as little as possible. 2. All full-time teaching staff of spare-time cultural supplementary schools for cadres run by Party and government organs (excluding enterprises) and mass organizations can be included in the administrative establishment. The salaries of full-time teachers can be paid according to the salary standards of ordinary school teachers and staff according to the treatment of administrative personnel. 3. Part-time teacher subsidies, student textbook fees, and other teaching expenses shall be paid from the organ's cadre learning fees or the trade union's cultural and educational fees.

If cadres in enterprise departments participate in spare-time cultural supplementary schools for cadres sponsored by administrative organs, the enterprise unit shall share a certain number of full-time teaching staff salaries and benefits and other teaching expenses. Specific methods shall be discussed and resolved by the local Party committee convening relevant parties.

Second, from January 1954, the funds for cadre cultural supplementary schools, cadre literacy classes, and worker-peasant accelerated elementary schools for cadres leaving their jobs for study shall be uniformly paid from the cadre training fees. The establishment can be determined by the local Party committee itself with reference to the current standards.

(14) In order to strengthen the leadership of cadre cultural education, the cultural committees at or above the provincial and municipal levels should set up cadre cultural education bureaus (departments), equipped with a certain number of personnel to manage cadre cultural education undertakings; if conditions are not available, they will still be managed by the education administrative departments for the time being. Below the special county, it should be managed by the Party committee propaganda department, equipped with full-time cadres, and cooperate with the government cultural and educational departments to carry out this work. This institution specifically in charge of cadre cultural education should, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, cooperate with the government education, personnel departments, and other relevant parties to effectively and responsibly do this work well. As for cadre cultural supplementary schools (including worker-peasant accelerated elementary schools) and cadre cultural supplementary classes attached to Party schools, and cadre literacy classes, etc. that leave their jobs for study, the Party committee organization department should be responsible for leadership; spare-time cultural supplementary schools for cadres of organs should be designated by Party committees and administrative heads of organs at all levels. to be responsible for leadership. The above provisions shall be implemented in various localities according to specific circumstances and in accordance with local conditions.

After receiving these instructions, the Central Bureaus, Sub-bureaus, and Provincial and Municipal Party Committees should convene appropriate meetings to conduct serious discussions, formulate specific implementation plans, and implement them. Before the end of June 1954, the Central Bureaus and Sub-bureaus should submit a special report to the Central Committee on this work.

    中国共产党中央委员会
    关于加强干部文化教育工作的指示
    一九五三年十二月二十四日
    大量培养与提拔工农干部，和有计划地提高他们的政治、文化、业务水平，使他们成为各项建设事业中的骨干，乃是贯彻党在过渡时期总路线的一项重大的政治任务和组织任务。几年来干部文化教育工作，是有一定成绩的，但目前还有大量的工农干部文化水平很低，阻碍了他们的政治水平和业务能力的提高，使他们在国家新的建设任务面前，感到有不能胜任的困难。因此，各级党委必须十分重视干部的文化教育工作，并加强其领导。为了切实做好这一工作，有效地提高工农干部的文化水平，以适应国家建设的需要，特作如下的指示：
    （一）目前开展干部文化教育的目的，在于使文化水平较低的干部，逐步提高到相当于高小以至初中毕业的水平，以便有效地学习政治理论，钻研业务，完成各项工作任务；同时使一部分工农干部能够具备条件升学深造。各级党、政机关和人民团体应尽可能地动员与组织文化程度不到初中毕业的干部学习文化，并将他们的学习成绩，作为干部鉴定、考绩标准之一。
    （二）在进行干部文化教育工作时，应着重吸收担负一定领导责任的工农干部参加学习，同时亦应适当注意组织警卫员、通讯员、勤务员等入学。对警卫员和勤务人员迫切的学习要求，采取漠不关心的态度，不给以文化学习的机会，是不对的，应加纠正。
    （三）干部文化教育必须采取速成的和联系实际的教学方针。课程应精简集中，教学内容应适当联系学员的工作，教学方法应适合工农干部的特点。那种不顾工农干部的特点和实际要求，在教学上机械搬用普通学校的一套或者求速不求成的做法，都是不对的，应加以防止和纠正。
    （四）干部文化学习应根据具体情况，分别采取在职业余学习或离职集中学习的方式进行。由于大多数工农干部不可能完全离职学习，因此，一般干部的学习应以业余学习为主。
    （五）县以上各级机关，应根据具体条件，有步骤地开办干部业余文化补习学校或文化补习班。机关党、政领导上对此应经常关心，并给以应有的支持，还须指定专人负责帮助解决其一定的问题，如指导学校订教学计划，保证学员文化学习的时间，及时解决学校所必需的经费和上课地点等；并须加强对教师与学员的政治思想领导，使教师安心工作，学员尊师好学，师生团结一致，共同完成教学任务。
    关于干部业余文化补习学校或文化补习班的学制、课程、教学时间、教师和制度等，一般作如下的规定。各地可根据实际情况参照施行。
    （1）学制：高小班大约二年（扫盲阶段在外），初中班大约三年。个别有条件的地方和单位，可重点试办高中班和夜大学。
    （2）课程：高小班设语文、算术二科，暂时不能设置初中班次的地方，可增设自然常识。初中班一般可设语文、代数、历史、地理、自然常识五科；如因工作需要必须学习其他课程（如几何、物理、化学、生物、生理卫生等科）时，可开办选修班。上述课程各地均得按不同对象与不同要求酌量增减。课程排列，以单课独进或两科并进为宜。
    （3）教学时间：每年分两学期，每学期授课时间，应保证二十周；每周上课时间一般应不少于六小时。各科教学时间，大体上可订为：高小语文算术各二四○小时，（共四八○小时）；初中语文三○○小时，代数一二○小时，历史一○○小时，地理八○小时，自然一二○小时（共七二○小时）。各地可根据具体情况灵活掌握。
    （4）干部业余文化补习学校或文化补习班，必须从机关、团体工作人员中聘请兼职教员任课，并适当配备一定数量的专职教员作为教学中的骨干，并管理教学工作。对兼职教员，必要时可酌量减轻其原有的工作或酌予补助。那种认为只有专职教员顶事，否认兼职教员作用的做法，是不妥当的。为了提高教学效果，须适当组织教师进行业务学习。
    （5）干部业余文化补习学校或文化补习班应
  根据学员现有文化程度，分科编班，以免同一学科
  的学员文化水平悬殊太大。同时必须逐步建立请假、补课、升级、考试、毕业等项制度，以保证教
  学工作的正常进行。
    （六）农村区干部，除区委书记区长外，一般
  以业余学习为主。并得参照上述业余文化补习学校的各项办法，结合当地具体情况，采取多种方式进
  行学习。
    （七）由于区委书记区长以上主要干部工作任
  务繁重，流动性大，在业余时间坚持系统的文化学习困难较多，因此地委以上各级党委，应逐步设立干部文化补习学校，或在党校及其他干部学校内附设干部文化补习班，有计划地分期分批抽调文化水平较低的老干部离职集中学习。对于那些将要转入工业部门去工作的文化水平较低的干部，尤应尽先抽调离职学习。各级党政领导机关务必加强对此类学校的领导，经常给以具体帮助，负责审查和批准学校的教学方针和计划，配备质量较强的领导骨干和一定数量的专职干部与教员，同时应按照规定条件抽调干部入学。此类学校的学制、课程、教学时间等问题，各地可酌情参照干部业余文化补习学校的各项办法自行规定。
    （八）现由各级教育行政部门领导的工农速成初等学校，从一九五四年一月起，应一律改为干部文化补习学校，或党校附设的干部文化补习班，交由当地党委直接领导，并应切实加以整顿。如建立各种必要的制度，克服混乱现象；修订教学计划；对教员中不称职者，予以调整；对学员中不合乎条件及病弱不能坚持学习者另行妥善安置等。
    （九）为了适应国家建设工作的需要，应大力扫除工农干部中的文盲。此项工作除一般的应采取业余学习方式进行外，在有条件的地区，均应由县或专署主办速成识字班，有计划地抽调县区级文盲、半文盲干部入学；一般争取在三、四个月的时间以内（实际教学五百小时左右），达到能识常用字两千左右，阅读通俗书报，写二、三百字的短文的程度。同时应注意在教学上边教边巩固，防止单纯赶时间、速而不成的偏向。
    （十）有计划地提高工矿企业干部的文化水平，对推进国家工业建设有很重要的意义。各级党委和主管业务部门对此应十分重视，并加强对这一工作的领导，制订切实可行的计划，适当解决其学习时间、编制、经费等问题。
    （十一）编辑一套适合工农干部文化学习的教材，是办好干部文化教育的关键之一。政务院文化教育委员会应协同各地文委组织一定力量，有计划有步骤地进行这一工作。目前应先搜集与审阅各地现有课本，选择其中较好的向各地推荐，以应急需。
    （十二）少数民族的干部文化学习，原则上应使用本民族的语文，但在自愿原则下，亦可采取当地社会生活中普遍应用的别种文字；其学制、课程及教学时间等，得根据具体情况，参照上述规定办理。
    （十三）关于干部文化教育事业的编制和经费，暂行规定如下：
    第一、关于干部业余文化教育事业的编制和经费：1、业余文化补习学校（包括干部业余扫盲班）的专职干部与教师的配备，大体上可平均每一百名学员配备专职教员一人，每三百名学员配备专职干部一人，各地可根据具体情况，适当掌握。在能多聘兼任教员任课时，专职教员应尽量少设。2、凡党政机关（不包括企业单位）和群众团体所办干部业余文化补习学校的专职教职员工，均可列入行政编制以内。专职教员的工资，可参照普通学校教员工资标准按行政人员待遇发给。3、兼职教员津贴和学员课本费以及其他教学费用，由机关干部学习费或工会文教费项下开支。
    企业部门干部如参加行政机关主办的干部业余文化补习学校学习时，该企业单位应分担一定名额的专职教职员的工薪福利及其他教学费用。具体办法由当地党委召集有关方面商讨解决。
    第二、关于离职学习的干部文化补习学校、干部扫除文盲班以及工农速成初等学校的经费，从一九五四年一月起，均统一由干部训练费项下开支。其编制可由各地党委参照现行标准自行规定。
    （十四）为了加强对干部文化教育的领导，省、市以上各级文委应设立干部文化教育局（处），配备一定数量的人员，掌管干部文化教育事业；如条件不具备时，仍暂由教育行政部门管理。专县以下，应由党委宣传部门主管，配备专职干部，协同政府文教部门，进行这一工作。此项专管干部文化教育的机构，应在党委统一领导下，协同政府教育、人事部门以及其他有关方面，切实负责做好这一工作。至于离职学习的干部文化补习学校（包括工农速成初等学校）和党校附设的干部文化补习班以及干部扫盲班等，应由党委组织部门负责领导；机关干部业余文化补习学校，应由各级机关党委和行政负责人指定专人负责领导。上述各项规定，在各地实施时得根据具体情况，因地制宜。
    各中央局、分局和省、市委在接到本指示后，应召开适当会议，认真进行讨论，订出具体执行的计划，加以贯彻。在一九五四年六月底以前，各中央局、分局应就此项工作向中央作一专题报告。
