Yang Yifu, a Special-Class Combat Hero of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Writes a Letter to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Reporting on the Achievements in Railway Construction

Respected Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

It has been over a year since I came to the Sha (Cheng) Feng (Tai) railway line to build tunnels! In construction engineering, I have gone from not understanding to understanding, from being an amateur to an expert, and have victoriously spent the first year of the Five-Year Plan. Now the No. 9 tunnel we built is already open to traffic.

When I first arrived at the construction site, everything felt unfamiliar, but we are the invincible People's Liberation Army, and there are no difficulties that we cannot overcome. With this belief, I soon learned how to drill blasting holes and pour concrete. Later, I created some other new working methods, increasing efficiency by 50 to 100 percent, and overfulfilled the tasks assigned by the higher authorities. Later, the higher authorities assigned the second platoon to me to lead. In my work, I always kept in mind the words of the leading comrades: "We must connect with the masses and study our profession." How can we better exert the strength of the collective? I tried to redistribute the labor organization, so that our entire platoon did not have any casualties in a year, the entire platoon received a Third-Class Collective Merit, and we won a Red Banner of Excellence. When building the nationally famous No. 17 tunnel, which is more than 2,400 meters long, the second Red Banner of Excellence was won by us thanks to the efforts of the comrades.

Dear Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: The soldiers you have taught are forever victorious and advancing. Under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, we will continue to work hard to improve our technical, cultural, and political levels, exert selfless labor enthusiasm, and strive for new and greater victories.

　　　　　　　　　　　　Your soldier, Yang Yifu

    中国人民解放军某部特等战斗功臣杨一夫写信
    向毛主席、朱总司令报告修建铁路的成绩
    敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    我到沙（城）丰（台）铁路线上修隧道，转眼已一年多啦！在建筑工程上，我由不懂到懂，由外行到内行，胜利地渡过了五年计划的头一年。现在我们修的第九号隧道已经通火车了。
    我一到工地，什么都感到生疏，但是，我们是攻无不克、战无不胜的人民解放军，在我们面前没有克服不了的困难。怀着这样的信念，不久我就学会了打炮眼、灌注混凝土的方法。以后又创造了其他一些新的工作法，提高效率百分之五十至百分之一百，超额完成了上级交给的任务。后来上级把第二排交给我来领导，在工作中，我老想着领导同志的话：“要联系群众，钻研业务。”怎样才能把集体的力量更好地发挥出来呢？我想法把劳动组织重新调配了一下，这样我们全排在一年中没有发生任何伤亡事故，全排立了一个三等集体功，得了一面优胜红旗。在修两千四百多公尺长的全国著名的十七号隧道的时候，因为同志们的努力，第二面优胜红旗又夺到了我们手中。
    亲爱的毛主席、朱总司令：您们教导出来的战士是永远胜利前进的。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，我们将继续努力，提高技术、文化和政治水平，发挥忘我的劳动热情，争取新的更大的胜利。
                      您们的战士　杨一夫
