In the past year, the work of culture and art, according to the cultural and educational policy of "consolidation, key development, improvement of quality, and steady progress," has been actively developing various literary and artistic creations suitable for the needs of the people on the one hand, to strive to meet the growing cultural demands of the broad masses; on the other hand, it has been rectifying various cultural institutions so that they can exert their due effectiveness in the popularization and dissemination of culture. Under this policy, the work of the past year has achieved certain results. The planning of cultural undertakings has been strengthened compared with the past, the specific policies of various undertakings have also been clarified, and attention has begun to be paid to grasping the key points in the work. These aspects show the progress in our work. However, there are still many important shortcomings and problems: cultural work is still seriously lagging behind the needs of the people, the planning of cultural undertakings is not precise enough, the management of various undertakings is not strict enough, and the efficiency is not high. Subjectivism, decentralism, and bureaucratism in the work are still serious. These are obstacles that we urgently need to overcome in our progress.

The main situations, problems, and future opinions of the work in the past year are briefly reported as follows:

I

(1) Film production work. In 1953, a total of ten feature films were completed (as a cross-year task for 1952, the scripts for the twelve feature films of 1953 have been completed and put into production, but they will not be released until 1954), ten large documentaries, sixteen short documentaries, ten science education films, fifty-two newsreels, fifteen news specials, twenty-four international newsreels, forty feature films and thirty educational films translated from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, and a total of thirty-seven films translated into the languages of domestic ethnic minorities and Cantonese. Except for feature films, all types of films have completed the plan, and some have even exceeded it. The main difficulty in the production of feature films is still the lack of film scripts. In order to fundamentally change this situation, we have launched a more systematic study of the creative methods of socialist realism among film screenwriters, directors, actors, and other artistic cadres; corrected the method of formulating subject matter plans subjectively without starting from reality; and improved the work of organizing script creation—changing the simple administrative methods, and adopting methods suitable for the characteristics of artistic creation, using more social methods, and striving to organize external manuscripts and relying on the cooperation and support of the broad literary and artistic writers. The creative situation has generally improved. Although the production of feature films in 1953 did not complete the plan, all the feature film scripts scheduled for this year have been completed according to the plan, and a more reliable plan for the subject matter of the 1954 script has been formulated. In addition, some efforts have been made to improve the production of documentaries and translated films.

(2) Film screening work. In 1953, 1076 film screening teams were developed. Including the audience in movie theaters, the film audience was nearly 700 million person-times (the original task was 620 million person-times), exceeding the target by 11%, an increase of more than 24% compared with 1952 (the audience in 1952 was more than 560 million person-times, the above-mentioned audience person-times do not include the audience person-times of the film screening teams in the military system).

(3) Drama work. In this year, the reorganization of various types of state-owned theater troupes across the country was basically completed. The theater troupes began to clarify the direction of specialized development and initially established more standardized systems for various artistic works. The Chinese Opera Research Institute reviewed and compiled 60 kinds of popular Peking Opera scripts. Various localities have begun to organize the repertoire of operas in a more planned way. The excellent repertoire of the National Opera Festival has been widely exchanged in various places. The creation and performance of spoken drama have also been more active this year. The newly created repertoire includes "Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits," "Forty Years of Hope," and "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River." The creation and performance of one-act plays have also been encouraged. The plays "Zhao Xiaolan" and "Women Representatives" have been widely staged throughout the country. The Soviet play "Dawn Shines on Moscow" has been performed more than 1,500 times across the country. In this year, the state-owned theater troupes basically completed the scheduled performance tasks (including theater performances, touring performances in factories, mines, and rural areas, and foreign performances). According to incomplete statistics, there were about nearly 30,000 performances; especially the two large-scale visits to North Korea to express condolences and the visits to Lushun and Dalian to express condolences to the Soviet army, which received great results.

The private theater troupes were supported in key ways, and the private-run and publicly-assisted theater troupes were developed. Experience has proved that it is a practical and feasible way to gradually bring private theater troupes into the track of correct development through the way of private-run and publicly-assisted.

(4) Popularization of art and the work of sorting out and promoting national folk art. In this year, the National Folk Music and Dance Festival was held, which was another important national competition performance after the National Opera Festival in 1952. This festival has aroused the universal attention of various places to folk music and dance art, and greatly promoted the work of exploring and sorting out folk art and uniting folk artists. The excellent programs in the festival have been promoted throughout the country, and some programs have won international awards at the 4th World Youth and Students Peace and Friendship Festival. The newly opened painting gallery of the Palace Museum and the National Chinese Painting Exhibition and the National Folk Art and Crafts Exhibition jointly held by the headquarters and the Chinese Artists Association have played a certain role in promoting the tradition of national painting and developing folk arts and crafts.

(5) Art education work. Preliminary adjustments were made to the national art academies and schools, and affiliated secondary art schools were established in some art academies and schools. After the adjustment, the tasks and division of labor of the art academies and schools have been further clarified; at present, the academies and schools are concentrating their efforts on solving the problems of teachers and teaching materials. In order to strengthen the study and research work of the national art heritage, the Chinese Painting Research Institute and the National Music Research Institute were established in the Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Conservatory of Music.

(6) Cultural center, station work and slide work. In view of the excessive and rapid development of cultural centers and stations in the past, the development was stopped in terms of quantity this year, and the focus was on rectification to improve quality. Various places have begun to attach importance to the work of cultural centers. Some large areas (such as Northeast, East China, and Central South) have held cultural center work conferences; about 25 provinces and cities have carried out the work of training cultural center cadres. Based on the research on the situation and experience of various places, the Central Ministry of Culture recently issued instructions on strengthening the work of cultural centers and stations.

In order to make the production of slide projectors and films more planned and gradually improve the quality of their products, the China Slide Company was established at the end of last year. In addition to producing a large number of newer slide projectors, it completed 85 slide films and printed more than 104,000 sets.

(7) Museum, library work and cultural relics protection work. In this year, the work of museums and libraries was also mainly based on rectification and consolidation, and the quantity was generally not developed. The Palace Museum and the History Museum directly under the headquarters have carried out some rectification over the years, and have collected a lot of lost precious items. The Palace Museum has initially completed the comprehensive art exhibition according to the era, and has newly opened special museums such as the Painting Gallery and the Ceramics Museum. The History Museum has held the Chu Cultural Relics Exhibition. According to incomplete statistics, the number of visitors to the Palace Museum reached 1.2 million by the end of November this year. In addition to strengthening social activities (such as holding lectures), the Beijing Library has also carried out information collection, sorting, and supply in coordination with national economic construction.

Due to the large-scale basic construction carried out throughout the country, important underground cultural relics have been discovered on construction sites. The Administrative Council specially issued instructions on coordinating basic construction and doing a good job in the protection of cultural relics. According to these instructions, various places have organized cultural relics work teams to carry out work. The excavation and preservation of underground cultural relics along the Chengdu-Chongqing and Baoji-Chengdu Railways, and the introduction and research of ancient murals and stone carvings such as Maijishan and Bingling Temple, are more significant in the cultural relics work in 1953.

(8) Literary and artistic publishing work. In this year, the national literary publishing agency published 262 kinds of books (some of which are reprints), with a total of more than 17 million copies printed, an increase of more than 110% over the previous year. In addition to printing the single editions of Lu Xun's works, it also began to selectively publish excellent works since the "May Fourth" Movement and classic masterpieces such as "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and "Dream of the Red Chamber." In this year, the national art publishing agency printed more than 450 kinds of New Year pictures, with more than 32 million copies printed, and about 1,000 kinds of comic strips.

(9) Foreign cultural and artistic liaison work. In this year, the Chinese Youth Art Troupe was sent to participate in the performance of the 4th World Youth and Students Peace and Friendship Festival, and performed a total of 156 performances in Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Germany and other places, with a total audience of more than 830,000 person-times, publicizing our country's excellent cultural and artistic achievements to the people of the world, and played a certain role in consolidating the friendship between the Chinese and the people of various brotherly countries and safeguarding the cause of world peace. In this year, the Czechoslovak, Hungarian, Soviet, and Bulgarian Film Weeks were held successively, focusing on introducing the excellent films of various brotherly countries, with an audience of more than 16 million person-times. In addition, this year, cultural and artistic groups from various brotherly countries successively came to China from Poland, North Korea, Mongolia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic. These international artistic friends visited major cities in our country and many factories, mines, and rural areas, and gave many performances to our people, giving great encouragement and inspiration to our literary and artistic workers.

II

Looking back on the cultural and artistic work in the past year, we have realized that the main difficulties and shortcomings in the work are: on the one hand, literary and artistic creation is far behind the needs of the people and the country in terms of quantity and quality; on the other hand, the development of cultural undertakings is spontaneous and blind, lacking planning, and lacking strict management of various undertakings.

With the improvement of the people's political consciousness and material life, the masses urgently demand new literature and art with correct ideological content, and need proper cultural entertainment and cultural food, but our current literary and artistic creation (including performance) cannot meet the needs of the masses. One is that there are too few new works, and the other is that many works have not reached the level required by the masses in terms of ideology and art, and have not reached the combination of profound ideological content and beautiful artistic form. This situation certainly has its objective historical reasons, but the lack of strong and correct leadership over creative activities is an important subjective reason. We have put too much energy on administrative affairs, and have not organized and guided literary and artistic creation and practice with enough strength and correct methods. In the work of organizing creation, some inappropriate simple administrative methods were often adopted, such as in the formulation of film subject matter plans, without fully estimating the different situations of various writers, but subjectively stipulating their creative tasks, topics, and completion time. Not enough concern, love, support, and encouragement for artistic creation and artistic talents. Not enough attention to the practice of literature and art, many writers do not write for many years, and many art performance groups and actors do not get the opportunity to perform for many years, so that their business is deserted and unfamiliar. And new creations are often more harshly criticized than constructive criticism and concrete help, and sometimes a work is lightly denied without seriously summing up the experience of a creation's success or failure, drawing lessons from it, and helping writers. In the work of opera reform, the idea of relying on artists has not been universally implemented. In the work of revising and writing scripts, they are often not good at winning the cooperation of artists, but rely solely on a few so-called opera reform workers to take care of everything, so that the newly released scripts are often of poor quality or not suitable for stage performance. (Experience has proved that the more successful opera programs on the stage now are almost all obtained by relying on the cooperation of artists.) In this way, the enthusiasm and creativity of artistic creators are damaged, thus hindering the normal development of artistic creation. In the past year, we have begun to strengthen and improve the leadership of literary and artistic creation. The first is to adopt a policy of active development and support for literary and artistic creation, strengthen artistic practice, encourage creation, change the simple administrative methods and rough attitude in the leadership of creation, and use more social methods to promote creation. The most important thing is to rely on literary and artistic workers' own groups (Federation of Literary and Art Circles and various associations) to organize creation and carry out criticism. In addition, it also promotes free competition in artistic creation and appropriately rewards creation. At present, the situation of artistic creation has generally improved and has begun to show signs of activity.

The scope and contact of cultural undertakings are very extensive. To do this work well, we must first have planning, but in the past we lacked planning in our work and there was spontaneity and blindness. We have shown the idea of greed and rashness on many issues. This is mainly due to insufficient understanding of the characteristics of cultural and artistic undertakings, and a lack of comprehensive and thorough consideration of the unbalanced state of economic and cultural development of the entire country, the needs of the people, the subjective conditions of cultural work, and the actual effects of each work. For example, in the development plan of the film industry, there was an unrealistic idea of concentrating all film production in one place and building a so-called "big film village." For example, many film screening teams have been developed, but no screening management agency has been established for a long time, resulting in many problems in the work. For example, the selection of films for rural areas is improper, and there is a lack of appropriate publicity and explanation to cooperate with the screening, etc., which has not been resolved in time. For example, in the work of reorganizing the theater troupes, because the different needs of different regions in the development of work were not considered (such as some places are not qualified to establish spoken drama troupes, and some private theater troupes are not qualified to be changed to state-owned, etc.), and there were no specific steps and methods for reorganization, resulting in the phenomenon of some places streamlining and reorganizing on the one hand, and filling the ranks on the other. For example, too many cultural centers and stations have been developed too quickly. Because their nature, policies, and tasks have not been clearly defined for a long time, and there is a lack of supervision and inspection, many cultural centers lack a center of gravity, inappropriately doing many things that should be done by the government's cultural administrative departments, and there have been many phenomena of coercion and violation of policies. These all show that we lacked planning for the development of undertakings in the past, and we lacked strict management of various undertakings. Since this year, the situation of blind development of cultural undertakings has changed, and various places have generally carried out the work of rectifying the cultural undertakings under their jurisdiction. Cultural work has begun to be carried out in a more planned and orderly manner.

The basic reason for the above shortcomings is that our leadership work has subjectivism, bureaucratism, and decentralism. Subjectivism, which does not proceed from reality and handles affairs based on feelings and impressions, is the most important root cause of all shortcomings and errors in the work; our bureaucratism is most prominently manifested in not understanding the situation below, which is essentially a manifestation of subjectivism. Due to the unique habit of individual mental labor of cultural and artistic workers and the liberalist style and accumulated habits among them, coupled with the lack of strong political and ideological leadership, this makes the phenomena of lack of organization, discipline, lack of overall concept, and each doing things in its own way often occur in cultural work. In the anti-bureaucracy inspection in the past year, the above-mentioned erroneous work styles and work methods have begun to be corrected, but how to continue to overcome these erroneous work styles and establish good work styles still requires great and persistent efforts.

III

Regarding the future work, we believe that: in the transitional period of the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, the policy and task of cultural and artistic work should be: actively develop literary and artistic creations suitable for the needs of the people, educate the broad masses with socialist spirit, encourage the masses to actively participate in national construction work, and gradually meet the growing cultural demands of the masses. To this end, we should strengthen artistic practice and gradually improve the level of literary and artistic creation. Cultural undertakings should generally focus on rectification and consolidation, improvement of quality, and at the same time, effectively strengthen the management of various undertakings within a certain period of time. The specific policies and practices of several major undertakings are proposed as follows:

(1) Further develop and improve film art: (1) Strengthen film production, on the existing basis, gradually improve the ideological and artistic level of feature films, expand the scope of subject matter, enrich film genres, and strive to increase the number of films, ensuring the production of 12 to 15 large feature films each year, and several rural feature films and children's films; in addition, produce more than 10 large documentaries, more than 20 short documentaries, and more than 10 science education films. Translated films should maintain an appropriate proportion in the entire film production, and further improve the quality of translation and production. For feature films, on the one hand, we must ensure a certain political and artistic level, and on the other hand, we cannot make excessive demands that are divorced from the current conditions. (2) The Chinese Writers Association should assist the Film Bureau in launching and organizing writers across the country to actively participate in film script creation. (3) Strengthen the regular political education and professional study of existing film artistic cadres (mainly directors, screenwriters, actors) from artistic practice, and at the same time, adopt apprenticeship and other appropriate methods to train new actors. (4) Improve the method of formulating film subject matter plans and organizing film script creation, and establish a unified review system for film scripts and films.

(2) Gradually develop the screening network and establish the film industry: (1) The development policy of the screening industry is to first face factories and mines, and focus on developing mobile screening teams in rural areas and small cities, and should actively and steadily develop on the basis of rectifying and consolidating existing screening units. (2) Strengthen the management of screening work, pay attention to the selection of films for different audiences (especially rural audiences) and strengthen the publicity and explanation of film content, strengthen the training and training of screening personnel and regular education. (3) Develop the manufacturing industry of screening machines, and achieve complete self-sufficiency of screening machines within two or three years. Establish a film washing and printing factory, and prepare conditions to build a film manufacturing industry to supply the large demand for film copies from screening teams.

(3) Strengthen the work of theater troupes: (1) First, run well the various types of theater troupes directly under the central government (including song and dance troupes, acrobatic troupes, and other performing groups), so that they can play a demonstrative role in the country. Continue to strengthen the work of spoken drama. (2) Organize the creation and adaptation of scripts, stipulate the programs to be performed by the central theater troupes within a certain period of time (spoken drama, opera and opera repertoires, and song and dance programs) and promote them to the whole country in a planned way; local opera troupes should continue to sort out the old excellent scripts of local operas and create new scripts; local spoken drama troupes, in addition to performing the repertoires recommended by the central government, should compile and perform scripts reflecting the local people's life and struggle according to the specific situation, and continue to overcome the current state of uncontrolled freestyle performance repertoires. (3) Keep the state-owned theater troupes regularly performing for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers (including theater performances and touring performances), with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main audience; at the same time, strengthen the regular political education and professional study of the theater troupes in artistic practice, especially strengthen the technical training of actors and effectively protect the health of actors. Overcome the harmful egalitarianism in the treatment of artistic cadres. (4) In view of the fact that there are many private theater troupes, they have a broad foundation in people's lives and will still exist for a considerable period of time. We should actively lead and manage private theater troupes. Continue to correct the rude work style and certain illegal and undisciplined behaviors in dealing with artists and opera reform work, strengthen the in-depth and meticulous ideological education of the broad masses of artists, and at the same time, take appropriate measures to gradually improve private theater troupes politically and professionally. Among them, those with good individual conditions should be cultivated in key ways to prepare for the future transformation into state-owned theater troupes, overcome and prevent the premature and immature rush to change private theater troupes into state-owned, and at the same time overcome the tendency to let private theater troupes go their own way, allow them to develop blindly, and not lead them.

(4) Strengthen art education work: (1) Strengthen the leadership of art education, and first seriously run the central art colleges well. (2) In addition to training new specialized artistic talents, the art colleges should adapt to the current needs, and transfer in-service cadres from various art departments to improve them in a planned way. In addition, we should also train artistic talents of ethnic minorities in a planned way. (3) In the entire teaching process, we should seriously implement the study of advanced Soviet art theories and experience, study and research national art heritage and folk art, and effectively overcome the bias of neglecting technical training.

(5) Strengthen the popularization of art: (1) Actively develop mass amateur artistic activities in factories, rural areas, schools, and organs, and give correct guidance. First, we should clarify their amateur nature and prevent inappropriate development towards specialization; in terms of activity content, we should actively activate mass cultural life to achieve the purpose of mass self-education and entertainment. Therefore, we should pay attention to the healthy ideological content of mass art, and also appropriately pay attention to its legitimate entertainment. In terms of form, we should pay attention to adopting and developing folk art forms. (2) Professional art troupes should establish contact and guidance systems with amateur art organizations in factories and rural areas in the area, and should pay special attention to guiding mass creation, discovering and cultivating artistic geniuses among the masses. When conditions permit, regional observation performances can be held during slack farming seasons or festivals. (3) Supply the broad masses with various popular scripts, songs, picture albums, etc. that they need and are suitable for them in a planned way.

(6) Rectify and strengthen cultural centers and stations: (1) Clearly stipulate that the nature of cultural centers and stations is mass cultural undertakings established by the government, not government administrative agencies. Their main tasks are to carry out current affairs and policy propaganda, organize and guide the cultural learning of the masses, organize and guide the amateur artistic activities of the masses, and disseminate scientific and hygienic knowledge. In terms of working methods, we must rely on the masses and social forces, and overcome all styles of work that are divorced from the masses in the work of cultural centers and stations. (2) The cultural administrative departments of provinces, cities, counties, and districts should strengthen the leadership of cultural centers and stations; at present, they should concentrate their efforts on rectifying existing centers and stations, and no longer develop in quantity. Provinces and cities should also train cultural center cadres regularly and in a planned way.

(7) Rectify and strengthen museum and library work and strengthen cultural relics protection work: (1) First, run the Palace Museum, History Museum, Revolutionary Museum, and Beijing Library directly under the central government well, so that they can play a demonstrative role. The museum and library undertakings in various places should focus on rectification and collection, and run them well. The museums in various places should generally be determined as the nature of local chronicles museums. (2) Strengthen the protection of cultural relics, and it must be clear that protecting cultural relics is a major political task in cultural work. The view of underestimating cultural relics is wrong; it is also wrong to simply regard cultural relics as "antiques" for appreciation and nostalgia, and to preserve them without selection or analysis, so that they cannot become the beneficial property of the masses and become a tool for carrying out patriotic education for the broad masses. We must carry out protection in a planned and focused manner, formulate specific methods for protection and excavation, and carry out correct propaganda on protecting cultural relics to the broad masses of cadres and the masses. Those who have contributed to the protection of cultural relics should be commended, and those who have destroyed cultural relics should be educated or punished depending on the severity of the circumstances.

(8) Strengthen literary and artistic publishing work: further improve the quality of literary and artistic publications, and appropriately increase the number of types of books and periodicals. In addition to continuing to organize the publication of new creations and the translation of revolutionary works from the Soviet Union and other countries, we should also formulate a longer-term plan for sorting out, introducing, and printing Chinese and foreign classical works, and organize forces to gradually complete it.

(9) Strengthen foreign cultural liaison work: change the past passive coping situation, make foreign cultural liaison work more planned, and better organize literary and artistic workers to exchange experiences with foreign cultural and artistic groups and individuals who come to our country to perform and visit, and learn from each other.

To complete the above tasks well, the key lies in improving leadership. First, we should improve the leadership style and working methods of cultural administrative departments at all levels from top to bottom, establish true and effective collective leadership, strengthen investigation and research work and the training and education of cadres, effectively overcome the personal inspirational and handicraft-style methods and bureaucratic style of leadership work, and overcome the decentralism and liberalism tendencies among cadres at all levels. Second, we should improve the organizational structure of cultural administrative departments at all levels (mainly below the provincial and municipal levels). At the county level, under the principle of unified deployment and no increase in staffing, we should start from the special and first-class counties first, and gradually implement the division of cultural and educational departments, so that cultural work can have a dedicated management agency.

    中央文化部一九五三年工作报告
    （一九五三年十二月二十四日政务院第一百九十九次政务会议批准）
    一年来文化艺术工作，根据“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的文教事业方针，一方面积极发展适合人民需要的各种文学艺术创作，以力求满足广大群众日益增长的文化要求；另一方面对各项文化事业机构进行整顿，使之在文化的普及和传播上能发挥应有的效能。在这方针之下，一年来的工作是获得了一定成绩的。文化事业发展的计划性比以前加强了，各项事业的具体方针也较前明确，工作中已开始注意抓取重点，这些方面表现了我们工作上的进步。但仍存在不少重要的缺点和问题：文化工作仍然严重地落后于人民的需要，文化事业发展的计划性还不够精密，对各项事业的管理还不够严格，且效率不高，工作中的主观主义、分散主义和官僚主义作风还是严重的，这些都是我们在前进中亟须克服的障碍。
    兹将一年来工作的主要情况、问题和今后意见简报如下：
    一
    （一）电影制片工作。一九五三年共完成故事片十部（为一九五二年跨年度任务，一九五三年度十二部故事片剧本均已完成，并已下厂摄制，但须至一九五四年方能出片），大纪录片十部，短纪录片十六部，科学教育片十部，新闻周报五十二号，新闻特辑十五号，国际新闻二十四号，翻译苏联及其他兄弟国家故事片四十部、教育片三十部，译成本国少数民族语及粤语的影片共三十七部。除故事片外，各片种都完成了计划，有的并有超过。故事片制作上的主要困难仍然是缺乏电影剧本。为从根本上改变这种情况，我们在电影编剧、导演、演员等艺术干部中展开了比较系统的社会主义现实主义创作方法的学习；纠正了不从实际出发、主观主义地制订题材计划的办法；改善了组织剧本创作的工作——改变简单行政方式，而采取适合艺术创作特点的方法，更多地运用社会方式，努力组织外稿，依靠广大文艺作家的合作和支援。创作情况一般已有好转。一九五三年故事片的出产虽没有完成计划，但本年度预定的故事片剧本已全部按计划完成，并已订出了比较可靠的一九五四年度剧本题材计划。此外，对纪录片和翻译片的制作工作，也作了一些改进的努力。
      （二）电影放映工作。一九五三年度发展了一○七六个电影放映队。连电影院的观众在内，电影观众近七亿人次（原定任务为六亿二千万人次），超额完成百分之十一，较一九五二年增加百分之二十四以上（一九五二年观众为五亿六千多万人次，以上观众人次均不包括部队系统放映队的观众人次）。
      （三）戏剧工作。本年内基本上完成了全国各类国营剧团的整编，各剧团开始明确了专业化的发展方向，初步建立了比较正规的各种艺术工作的制度。中国戏曲研究院审定编印了京剧流行剧本六十种。各地对戏曲剧目已着手进行较有计划的整理。全国戏曲会演的优秀剧目在各地获得了广泛的交流。话剧方面的创作和演出本年也比较活跃起来，新创作剧目有“春华秋实”、“四十年的愿望”、“春风吹到了诺敏河”等；独幕剧的创作与演出也受到了鼓励，“赵小兰”、“妇女代表”等剧目在全国各地普遍上演。苏联剧本“曙光照耀着莫斯科”在全国演出达一千五百余场之多。本年度各国营剧团基本上均完成了预定的演出任务（包括剧场演出，工矿、农村巡回演出和国外演出），据不完全统计，共约近三万场；特别是两次大规模的赴朝慰问演出以及赴旅大慰劳苏军演出，收到了极大的效果。
    对私营剧团进行了重点扶植，发展了私营公助的剧团。经验证明，通过私营公助方式使私营剧团逐步纳入正确发展的轨道，是切实可行的办法。
      （四）艺术普及工作与整理和推广民族民间艺术的工作。本年度举办了全国民间音乐舞蹈会演，这是继一九五二年全国戏曲会演之后的又一重要的全国性的竞赛表演。这一会演引起了各地对民间音乐舞蹈艺术的普遍重视，大大推动了发掘和整理民间艺术、团结民间艺人的工作。会演中的优秀节目已在全国推广，有些节目并在第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节获得了国际奖。故宫博物院新辟的绘画馆和本部会同中国美术家协会先后举办的全国国画展览及全国民间美术工艺品展览，对发扬民族绘画的传统，发展民间工艺美术，均起了一定的作用。
      （五）艺术教育工作。对全国艺术院、校进行了初步的调整，并在部分艺术院、校中创设了附属中等艺术学校。经调整后，各艺术院、校的任务和分工有了进一步明确的规定；目前各院、校正集中力量解决师资和教材问题。为加强对民族艺术遗产的学习和研究工作，在中央美术学院、音乐学院创设了中国画研究所和民族音乐研究所。
    （六）文化馆、站工作及幻灯工作。鉴于过去文化馆、站发展太多、太快，本年度在数量上停止发展，着重进行整顿工作，以提高质量。各地对文化馆工作已开始重视，有些大区（如东北、华东、中南）举行了文化馆工作会议；约有二十五个省、市进行了调训文化馆干部的工作。中央文化部根据对各地情况和经验的研究，于最近发布了关于加强文化馆、站工作的指示。
    为使幻灯机、片的生产更有计划并逐步提高其出品质量，于去年底成立了中国幻灯公司，除生产了大量较新式的幻灯机外，完成了幻灯片八十五部，印制了十万四千余套。
    （七）博物馆、图书馆工作及文物保护工作。博物馆、图书馆工作，本年度亦以整顿巩固为主，数量上一般未发展。本部直属的故宫博物院、历史博物馆等年来均进行了一些整顿，搜集了不少散失的珍贵物品。故宫博物院初步完成了按时代的综合艺术陈列，并新辟了绘画馆、陶瓷馆等专馆，历史博物馆举办了楚文物陈列；据不完全统计，故宫本年度截至十一月底参观人数达一百二十万人。北京图书馆除加强了社会活动（如举办讲演会等）外，并配合国家经济建设进行了资料搜集、整理、供应等工作。
    由于全国展开了大规模的基本建设，在工地发现地下重要文物的情况迭有发生，政务院特颁发了配合基本建设做好保护文物工作的指示。各地根据这一指示，多已组织了文物工作队进行工作。成渝、宝成铁路沿线地下文物的发掘和保存工作，麦积山、炳灵寺等古壁画、石刻的介绍和研究，是一九五三年文物工作中较显著者。
      （八）文学艺术出版工作。国家文学出版机关本年度出版了书籍二六二种（其中一部分为重版书），共印行一千七百多万册，较上年度增加百分之一百一十以上。除印行了鲁迅著作的单行本之外，并开始有选择地出版了“五四”以来的优秀作品以及“水浒”、“三国演义”、“红楼梦”等古典名著。国家美术出版机关，本年度共印行了年画四百五十多种，印数三千二百多万份，连环画一千种左右。
      （九）对外文化艺术联络工作。本年度派遣中国青年艺术团参加第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的表演，并在罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、德国等地共表演了一五六场，先后观众共达八十三万余人次，对世界人民宣传了我国优秀的文化艺术成果，对巩固中国和各兄弟国家人民的友谊，保卫世界和平的事业，起了一定的作用。本年度先后举行捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、苏联、保加利亚电影周四次，集中地介绍了各兄弟国家的优秀影片，观众在一千六百万人次以上。此外，今年各兄弟国家来华文化艺术团体先后有波兰、朝鲜、蒙古、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国等国，这些国际艺术友人参观了我国各大城市和许多工矿、农村，对我国人民作了多次的演出，给予我国文艺工作者极大的鼓舞和启发。

    回顾一年来文化艺术工作，我们体会到工作上的主要的困难和缺点是在：一方面，文学艺术创作在数量和质量上都远落后于人民和国家的需要；另一方面，文化事业的发展又带有自发性和盲目性，缺乏计划性，对于各项事业缺乏严格的管理。
    随着人民政治觉悟的提高和物质生活的改善，群众迫切要求具有正确思想内容的新的文学艺术，需要正当的文化娱乐和文化食粮，但我们现在的文学艺术创作（包括表演在内）却不能满足群众的这种需要，一则是新的作品太少，二则很多作品在思想上和艺术上还没有达到群众所要求的水平，没有达到深刻的思想内容和优美的艺术形式的结合。这种情况固然有其客观的历史的原因，但对创作活动缺乏有力的、正确的领导，则是主观方面的重要原因。我们曾把过多的精力放在行政事务上，没有以足够力量和正确方法去组织和指导文学艺术的创作和实践。在组织创作的工作上，时常采取了一些不适当的简单行政方式，如在制定电影题材计划时，没有充分估计各个作家的不同情况，而主观地给他们规定创作任务、题目及完稿时间。对艺术创作和艺术人才的关心、爱护、扶植和鼓励不够。没有足够重视文学艺术的实践，不少作家常年不写作，不少艺术表演团体和演员常年得不到表演的机会，以致业务荒废生疏。而对新的创作又往往是苛刻的指责多于建设性的批评和具体的帮助，有时对一个作品轻率地加以否定，没有认真地去总结一个创作成功或失败的经验，从中取得教训，帮助作家。在戏曲改革工作上，依靠艺人的思想还没有普遍贯彻，在修改和编写剧本的工作中，往往不善于争取艺人的合作，而单凭少数所谓戏曲改革工作者一手包办，致使新出的剧本往往质量不高或不适宜于舞台演出。（经验证明，现在舞台上比较成功的戏曲节目，几乎都是依靠艺人合作得来的。）这样，就损害了艺术创作者的积极性和创造性，因而就妨碍了艺术创作的正常发展。一年来，我们已开始加强和改善对文学艺术创作的领导，首先是对文学艺术创作采取积极发展和扶植的方针，加强艺术实践，鼓励创作，改变在创作领导上的简单行政方法和粗暴态度，更多地运用社会方式来推动创作，最主要的是依靠文学艺术工作者自己的团体（文联及各协会）来组织创作和开展批评。此外，并多方促进艺术创作上的自由竞赛及对创作适当地进行奖励。目前艺术创作情况一般地已有好转，并开始呈现活跃的征象。
    文化事业所包括的范围和联系的群众，十分广泛，要做好这个工作，首先必须具有计划性，但我们过去在工作上却缺乏计划性而存在自发性和盲目性，在许多问题上曾表现贪多冒进思想。这主要是由于对文化艺术事业的特点认识不足，以及对整个国家经济与文化发展不平衡状况、人民需要、文化工作的主观条件和每一工作的实际效果等缺乏全盘的周密的考虑而产生的。如在电影事业发展计划上，曾有过将全部电影生产集中一地，建立所谓“大电影村”的不切实际的思想。又如电影放映队发展了很多，但长期没有建立放映管理机构，致在工作中发生许多问题。如对农村选择影片不当，缺乏配合放映的适当的宣传解释等，未能及时解决。又如在整编剧团工作中，因为没有考虑不同地区在工作发展上的不同需要（如有的地方没有条件成立话剧团，有的私营剧团不够条件改为国营等），又没有规定整编的具体步骤和办法，致造成有的地方一面精简整编，一面滥竽充数的现象。再如文化馆、站发展太多、太快，由于长期没有明确规定它们的性质、方针和任务，又缺乏督促检查，致使不少文化馆工作缺乏重心，不适当地做了许多应由政府文化行政部门来做的事，并发生不少强迫命令、违反政策的现象。这些都说明我们过去对事业发展是缺乏计划性的，对各项事业又是缺乏严格管理的。今年以来，文化事业盲目发展的状况已有改变，各地对所属文化事业一般地均进行了整顿的工作。文化工作已开始能够比较有计划地、有秩序地进行。
    产生上述缺点的基本原因，是我们领导工作上存在主观主义、官僚主义和分散主义。不从实际出发、凭感想和印象办事的主观主义作风，是造成工作中的一切缺点错误的最主要的根源；我们的官僚主义最突出的表现是不了解下情，这实质上也是主观主义的一种表现。由于文化艺术工作者特有的个体的精神劳动的习惯以及他们中间自由主义的作风和积习，再加上缺乏坚强的政治思想领导，这就使文化工作中无组织、无纪律、缺乏整体观念、各自为政等分散主义现象时有发生。一年来，在反官僚主义检查中，对上述错误的工作作风和工作方法已开始有所改正，但如何继续克服这些错误作风，树立良好作风，仍需要作极大的坚持的努力。
      三
    关于今后工作，我们认为：在国家进行社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的过渡时期，文化艺术工作的方针任务应当是：积极发展适合人民需要的文学艺术创作，以社会主义的精神教育广大人民，鼓舞群众努力参加国家建设工作，并逐步满足群众日益增长的文化要求。为此，应加强艺术实践，逐步提高文学艺术创作的水平。文化事业在一定时期内，一般应着重整顿巩固、提高质量，同时切实加强对各项事业的管理。兹就几项主要事业的具体方针和做法，提出如下意见：
    （一）进一步发展和提高电影艺术：（1）加强影片生产，在现有基础上，逐步提高故事片的思想艺术水平，扩大题材范围，丰富影片体裁，并努力增加影片数量，保证每年生产十二部至十五部大故事片，及若干农村故事片和儿童片；此外出产十部以上大纪录片、二十部以上短纪录片和十部以上科学教育片。翻译片应保持在整个影片生产中的适当比重，并进一步提高译制质量。对故事片，一方面必须保证其一定政治和艺术水平，另一方面也不可以做脱离现有条件的、不适当的过高要求。（2）由中国作家协会协助电影局发动并组织全国作家积极参加电影剧本创作。（3）从艺术实践中加强对现有电影艺术干部（主要是导演、编剧、演员）的经常政治教育和业务学习，同时采取带徒弟及其它适当方法培养新的演员。（4）改进制定电影题材计划及组织电影剧本创作的方法，建立对电影剧本和影片的统一的审查制度。
    （二）逐步发展放映网并建立电影工业：（1）放映事业的发展方针是首先面向工矿，在农村及小城市以发展流动放映队为主，并应在整顿和巩固现有放映单位的基础上积极地稳步地发展。（2）加强对放映工作的管理，注意对不同观众（特别是农村观众）的影片的选择和加强对影片内容的宣传解释工作，加强对放映人员的训练培养及经常的教育。（3）发展放映机器制造工业，在二三年内达到放映机全部自给。建立影片洗印工厂，并准备条件筹建胶片制造工业，以供应放映队对影片拷贝的大量需要。
    （三）加强剧团工作：（1）首先办好中央直属的各类剧团（包括歌舞团、杂技团等其它表演团体），使之能对全国起示范作用。继续加强话剧工作。（2）组织剧本的创作和改编工作，规定中央各剧团在一定时间内的上演节目（话剧、歌剧和戏曲剧目及歌舞节目）并有计划地向全国推广；各地方戏曲剧团应继续整理地方戏的旧有优秀剧本并创作新的剧本；各地话剧团除上演中央推荐的剧目外，应根据具体情况编演反映当地人民生活和斗争的剧本，继续克服目前上演剧目的无领导的自流状态。（3）保持国营剧团经常向广大工农兵观众演出（包括剧场演出和巡回演出），以工农兵为主要观众对象；同时在艺术实践中加强剧团的经常政治教育和业务学习，特别加强演员的技术训练并切实保护演员健康。克服在艺术干部待遇上的有害的平均主义倾向。（4）鉴于目前私营剧团数量甚多，在人民生活中有广大基础并在相当长时期内仍将存在，对私营剧团应积极地加以领导和管理。继续纠正在对待艺人和戏曲改革工作上的粗暴作风和某些违法乱纪行为，加强对广大艺人的深入细致的思想教育，同时采取适当办法使私营剧团在政治上和业务上逐渐提高，其中个别条件好的，则重点地加以培养，以准备将来转变为国营剧团，克服和防止过早地不成熟地将私营剧团改为国营的急躁情绪，同时克服对私营剧团放任自流，任其盲目发展，不加领导的倾向。
      （四）加强艺术教育工作：（1）加强对艺术教育的领导，首先认真办好中央各艺术学院。（2）各艺术院校除培养新的专门艺术人才外，应适应目前需要，有计划地抽调各艺术部门的在职干部加以提高。此外，并应有计划地培养少数民族的艺术人才。（3）在整个教学过程中，应认真贯彻学习苏联先进艺术理论和经验，学习和研究民族艺术遗产和民间艺术，切实克服忽视技术训练的偏向。
    （五）加强艺术普及工作：（1）积极发展工厂、农村、学校、机关中群众业余艺术活动，并加以正确的指导，首先应明确其业余性质，防止不适当地向专业化发展；在活动内容上，应从积极活跃群众文化生活以达到群众自我教育和娱乐的目的。因此，既要注意群众艺术的思想内容的健康，又要适当注意其正当娱乐性。在形式上应注意采用和发展民间艺术形式。（2）专业艺术剧团应和所在地区的工厂、农村业余艺术组织建立联系和辅导制度，特别应注意辅导群众创作，发现和培养群众中的艺术天才。在有条件时，并可利用农闲或节日举行地区性的观摩演出。（3）有计划地供应广大群众所需要的并适合他们的各种通俗的剧本、歌曲、画册等。
      （六）整顿和加强文化馆、站：（1）明确规定文化馆、站的性质是政府所设立的群众文化事业机构，而不是政府行政机关，其主要任务是进行时事政策宣传，组织和辅导群众的文化学习，组织和辅导群众业余艺术活动，传播科学卫生知识。在工作方法上必须依靠群众和社会力量，克服文化馆、站工作中的一切脱离群众的作风。（2）各省、市及县、区的文化主管部门应加强对文化馆、站的领导；目前应集中力量整顿现有馆、站，数量上不再发展。省、市并应有计划地定期地训练文化馆干部。
      （七）整顿和加强博物馆、图书馆工作并加强文物保护工作：（1）首先办好中央直属的故宫博物院、历史博物馆、革命博物馆及北京图书馆等单位，使之能起示范的作用。各地博物馆、图书馆事业应以整顿和征集工作为主，并大力办好。各地博物馆一般应确定为地方志博物馆的性质。（2）加强文物保护工作，必须明确保护文物是文化工作中一项重大政治任务。轻视文物的观点是错误的；将文物单纯地当作“古董”赏玩留恋，不加选择、不加分析地予以保存，因而不能使它成为群众的有益财产，成为向广大群众进行爱国主义教育的工具，也是错误的。必须有计划有重点地进行保护，订出保护与发掘的具体办法，并向广大干部和群众进行保护文物的正确宣传。对保护文物有贡献者应加表扬，对破坏文物者应视情节轻重予以教育或处分。
    （八）加强文学艺术出版工作：进一步提高文艺出版物质量，并适当增加书刊种数。除继续组织新的创作的出版和苏联及其它国家革命作品的翻译外，并应制订整理、介绍和印行中外古典著作的较长时期的计划，组织力量逐步完成。
      （九）加强对外文化联络工作：改变过去被动应付的状况，使对外文化联络工作更有计划，并更好地组织文艺工作者与来我国表演访问的外国文化艺术团体和个人交流经验，互相学习观摩。
    要很好地完成以上各项工作任务，决定关键在于改进领导。首先应从上而下地改进各级文化行政部门的领导作风和工作方法，建立真正的有效的集体领导，加强调查研究工作和对干部的培养教育工作，切实克服领导工作上个人灵感式的、手工业式的方法和事务主义作风，克服各级干部中的分散主义、自由主义倾向。其次，应健全各级（主要是省、市级以下）文化主管部门的组织机构。县级应在统一调配、不增加编制的原则下，先从特等、甲等县开始，逐步实行文教分科，使文化工作能有专责管理的机构。
