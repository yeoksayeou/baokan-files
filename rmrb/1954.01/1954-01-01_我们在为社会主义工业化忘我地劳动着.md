    We are working selflessly for socialist industrialization
    Wang Wenshan, Industrial Labor Model of Shenyang City, Workshop Director of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant
    The year 1954 has arrived. In the year 1953, our factory made great progress, and every one of our workers also made great strides. Our factory is one of the key construction projects of the country. This year, under the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, it began to expand, preparing to transform the factory into a new type of machine tool manufacturing plant. The original tool workshop has already been transformed into a new type of tool workshop, with more than ten new types of machine tools installed upstairs and downstairs. In the past, we could not manufacture precision tools, but in the future, we will be able to manufacture them ourselves. Take the Second Old Workshop of our factory as an example. It used to be an empty field without anything last year, but now it has completely changed. Dozens of brand-new automated and semi-automated machine tools have been installed. When production starts in the future, it will only take fifty-seven minutes to produce a beautiful new type of machine tool. How fast is the industrial development of the motherland! How happy it makes people!
    The workers in our workshop are working selflessly to enable the country to reach socialism as soon as possible. In the past year, they found 227 tricks, creating huge wealth for the country, and a large number of advanced producers emerged, with more than 180 people receiving material rewards. Tang Qiusheng, an old worker who has been working for more than 20 years, often says: "The working class must look forward!" When he was processing a certain part, his improvement increased production efficiency by more than one time, and he did not produce a single defective product for four consecutive months, and completed the annual task twelve days ahead of schedule. After studying the general line, everyone felt that their responsibility was greater and more glorious. The old worker Meng Hegui said to the young workers: "Young men, let's do it! Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction for us to realize the industrialization of the country. Even this old man feels energetic after studying the general line!" Now, the labor productivity of our workshop has been greatly improved. If January is 100, it has increased to 194.82 in November. It took more than 800 hours to produce a Yitu-163 lathe in April, but it was reduced to 460 hours in November.
    We must redouble our efforts, use the requirements of the national general line to examine our work, and welcome the victorious 1954.

    我们在为社会主义工业化忘我地劳动着
    沈阳市工业劳动模范  沈阳第一机床厂车间主任  王文山
    一九五四年来到了。在一九五三年一年中，我们工厂有了很大的发展，我们每一个工人也都有了很大的进步。我们工厂是国家重点建设工程之一，今年在苏联专家的指导和帮助下，开始扩建，准备把这个工厂改建成为新型的母机制造厂。现在已把原来的工具车间改成了新型的工具车间了，楼上楼下已安装了十多种新式机床。过去，我们不能制造精密的工具，将来就可以自己制造了。拿我们工厂的第二老工场来说吧，在去年前还是一个一无所有的空场房呢，现在完全变了样，好几十种崭新的自动化和半自动化的机床已装上啦。将来开工生产时，只要五十七分钟的时间，就可生产出一台挺漂亮的新型工作母机。看祖国的工业发展是多么快啊！叫人又是多么的高兴啊！
    我们车间工人为使国家能早日到达社会主义，都在忘我地劳动着。去年一年就找到了二百二十七件窍门，给国家创造了巨大的财富，涌现出大批的先进生产者，受到物质奖励的就有一百八十多人。做了二十多年工的老工人唐秋声常说：“工人阶级眼睛得往前看啊！”他在加工某种部件时，经他的改进，提高生产效率一倍多，一连四个月没出一件废品，还提早十二天完成了全年任务。经过总路线的学习，大家更感到自己的责任重大和光荣，老工人孟和贵对青年工人们说：“小伙子们干吧！毛主席把实现国家工业化的方向指给咱们了，连我这老头子学习了总路线也觉得浑身是劲呢！”现在，我们车间的劳动生产率大大提高了，如以一月份为一○○，到十一月份，已提高到一九四点八二了，四月份生产一台一凸六三车床需要八百多个小时，十一月份就降低到四百六十个小时了。
    我们一定要加倍的努力，以国家总路线的要求来检查自己的工作，迎接胜利的一九五四年。
