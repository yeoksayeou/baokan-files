　　Xinhua News Agency, 30th: In the first month of the new year, twenty-three state-owned and local state-owned factories in the capital have completed the national production plan ahead of schedule. Many factories have also excellently fulfilled their production plans. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant completed its plans for the main products pig iron, coke, and cast pipes more than one day ahead of schedule. The Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant produced eight universal milling machines in twenty-nine days, exceeding the production volume of any previous January, and each machine was assembled on schedule. The Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory broke the past practice of not releasing locomotives at the beginning of the year, completed the locomotive and passenger car repair plan five days ahead of schedule, and achieved balanced production by ten-day periods. The total output value of the Beijing Metal Structure Factory in January this year increased by 28.5% compared with the average monthly output value last year.
　　The workers of each factory accepted the lesson of not being able to complete the plan at the beginning of the year in the past, resulting in a slack beginning and a tight end to the year's production. They actively carried out preparatory work as early as the fourth quarter of last year; in the production process in January, they also overcame the idea of ​​"relaxing at the beginning of the year." The director of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant personally inspected and organized the workers to replenish the quota of work-in-process for each process as early as November last year. The Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts and established a dismantling workshop. At the end of last year, all the locomotives planned to be repaired in January this year were dismantled, making full preparations for production in January. In addition to mobilizing workers to discuss the January work plan before the new year, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant also organized special personnel to study the technical problems of blast furnace operation and re-determined the technical guidance policy for blast furnace operation, thus ensuring the smooth production of the blast furnace. Since November last year, the No. 53 workshop of the Beijing People's Printing Factory has organized new and old workers to sign master-apprentice contracts to accelerate the improvement of the technical level of new workers. Therefore, in January this year, some machines were changed from being operated by five people to four people, increasing the number of machines and improving the machine utilization rate by more than 8%. The workers in the assembly workshop of the Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Plant launched a mechanical movement in January, proposing and implementing eleven rationalization proposals for mechanization, which increased the average assembly efficiency by about 50%.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 29th: The state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine has overfulfilled the state production plan for January ahead of schedule on January 27th. In particular, the coal that is good without screening and washing has been overfulfilled a lot. As of the 26th, the mine had exceeded the monthly plan by 53.9%; the ash content of the coal was 3.7% lower than the state plan; and there were no serious injuries or deaths in the entire mine. According to statistics in mid-January, the average efficiency of all employees in the mine increased by 5.84% compared with the plan, and the consumption of pit wood was also 3.48% lower than the plan.
　　In order to ensure that this year's national plan can be fully and evenly completed starting from January, the Pingxiang Coal Mine Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all employees of the mine to continue to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. The Pingxiang Mining Bureau also emphasized at the workers' representative meeting that the production in the first quarter should not be lower than the level in the fourth quarter of last year and should not be less than 25% of this year's annual plan. The meeting also proposed a goal of striving to increase production and save 3 billion yuan for the country in the first quarter. Therefore, the enthusiasm of all employees for the campaign to increase production and practice economy in the fourth quarter of last year has been maintained, changing the phenomenon that has always been the case that people slack off at the beginning of the year. As of the 20th, the average attendance rate of all employees in the mine was above 93%, exceeding the level in the fourth quarter of last year.
　　The Spring Festival is approaching, and in order to create a good start for the balanced completion of this year's national plan, the employees of the Pingxiang Coal Mine are widely developing a full attendance movement during the Spring Festival. Many mining areas, teams, and individuals have successively formulated plans to ensure that they will not be absent from work, late, or leave early before and after the Spring Festival, and are determined to overcome the old habit of "going to work after the fifteenth day of the first lunar month after celebrating the first and third days of the first lunar month."

　　北京二十三个工厂完成本月计划
　　萍乡煤矿一月份生产计划提前超额完成
    【新华社三十日讯】在新的一年的第一个月中，首都有二十三个国营和地方国营工厂提前完成了国家生产计划。许多工厂还出色地完成了生产计划。例如：石景山钢铁厂主要产品生铁、焦炭和铸管都提前一天多完成计划。北京第一机床厂在二十九天内生产了八台万能铣床，超过了往年任何一月的生产量，并且每台都按计划日期装配完毕。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂打破了以往年初不出车的惯例，提前五天完成了机车、客车的修理计划，并且作到按旬均衡生产。北京市金属结构工厂今年一月份的生产总值比去年平均月产值提高百分之二十八点五。
    各厂职工接受过去年初不能完成计划，造成全年生产前松后紧的教训，早在去年第四季度就积极进行准备工作；在一月份生产过程中，也克服了“年初松口气”的思想。北京第一机床厂厂长在去年十一月份就亲自检查并组织职工补足了每个工序在制品的定额数量。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂执行了苏联专家建议，成立拆车车间，在去年年底就把今年一月份计划修理的机车全部拆开，给一月份生产作了充分的准备。石景山钢铁厂在年前除发动职工讨论了一月份作业计划外，并组织专人研究了高炉操作技术问题，重新确定高炉操作技术指导方针，因而保证了高炉的顺利生产。北京人民印刷厂五三车间自去年十一月份起，就组织新老工人签订师徒合同，加速提高新工人的技术水平，因此，今年一月份便把部分机器由五个人操作改为四个人，增开机器，提高机器利用率百分之八以上。北京第二机床厂装配车间的职工在一月份热烈地掀起了机械化运动，提出和实行了十一项机械化的合理建议，使装配效率平均提高百分之五十左右。
    【新华社南昌二十九日电】国营萍乡煤矿已在一月二十七日提前超额完成一月份的国家生产计划。其中特别是不需要经过筛和洗就很好的煤，超额很多。到二十六日止，该矿就超过全月计划百分之五十三点九；煤的灰份比国家计划降低百分之三点七；全矿没有发生过重伤或死亡事故。又根据一月中旬统计，全矿职工的平均效率比计划提高百分之五点八四，坑木消耗也比计划降低百分之三点四八。
    为了保证今年国家计划从一月份起就能全面、均衡地完成，中共萍乡煤矿委员会曾号召全矿职工继续开展增产节约竞赛。萍乡矿务局也在职工代表会议上，强调第一季度的生产不能低于去年第四季度的水平，不能少于今年全年计划的百分之二十五，会议并提出在第一季度为国家增产节约三十亿元的奋斗目标。因此，全体职工去年第四季度增产节约竞赛的热情一直保持下来，改变了历来年初就要松劲的现象。到二十日止，全矿职工出勤率平均在百分之九十三以上，超过了去年第四季度的水平。
    春节已到，萍乡煤矿职工为了给均衡完成今年国家计划创造一个良好的开端，正在广泛地发展春节全勤运动。许多矿井、小组和个人纷纷订出计划，保证春节前后不旷工，不迟到，不早退，决心克服“过了初一过初三，过了十五才上班”的旧习惯。
