(Xinhua News Agency, January 5th) According to TASS reports: The reply of G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to questions raised by Kingsbury Smith, European Manager of International News Service of the United States, has aroused widespread reaction in public opinion circles in European and Asian People's Democratic countries.

    The Polish "People's Tribune" pointed out: Comrade Malenkov's reply is new proof of the Soviet Union's consistent hope to ease international tensions. The great significance of this reply lies in the fact that it is in line with the deep aspirations of the people of all countries for lasting peace. This reply points out the possibility of improving relations between countries with different economic and political systems and easing international tensions. The Polish people warmly support Comrade Malenkov's reply. They believe this reply is a new hope, indicating that international tensions will be further eased in 1954.

    The Romanian "Spark" emphasized in its editorial that G.M. Malenkov's reply is full of concern for the fate of mankind and has therefore been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people of all countries. The initial reaction to Malenkov's congratulations to the American people indicates that these congratulations have had a profound impact in capitalist countries. The Romanian "Free Romania" wrote: Any proposition put forward by the Soviet government on the international stage is for the defense of peace. The interests of our people—the builders of socialism—are inextricably linked to the cause of defending and consolidating world peace. Therefore, the Romanian people warmly welcome Comrade G.M. Malenkov's reply.

    The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" wrote: The talk by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on the steps that should be taken for peace in 1954 will certainly receive widespread support from all good people. The Bulgarian people have supported, are supporting, and will support the Soviet peace policy in the future because it is in line with their vital interests.

    Hungarian newspapers also widely commented on Comrade Malenkov's reply. "Free People's Daily" wrote: The people of the world are becoming increasingly clear that the Soviet government is working to consolidate peace. Undoubtedly, when talking about these efforts now, we should first talk about the measures taken by the Soviet Union to prevent atomic war.

    The Korean Workers' Party Central Committee's newspaper "Labor News" wrote: Comrade Malenkov's reply strengthens our confidence in maintaining and consolidating peace and friendship between the people of all countries.
