Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department Workers
    Create New Daily Output Record on New Year's Day
    [This newspaper reported] The workers of the Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant in Shanxi Province, on New Year's Day of 1954, created a new daily output record since the furnace was built.
    After studying the general line of the state during the transition period, the workers of the Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department greatly increased their production enthusiasm. Before the New Year, they overhauled the electric furnace, formulated new technical organizational measures, and prepared for the production of the first quarter of this year. At the New Year's Eve party, the chairman of the trade union called on everyone, saying: "The New Year must have a new atmosphere. We must use new ideas to create new records so that our country's socialist industrialization will arrive sooner." The workers enthusiastically responded to his call.
    On New Year's Day, the workers made good arrangements for tools, raw materials, etc. in advance, and they were engaged in intense labor every minute. As a result, the smelting time of the first furnace of steel in No. 1 furnace was 4 minutes and 53 seconds, which was 37 seconds shorter than planned, and 1 minute and 15 seconds shorter than the average smelting time last year. The smelting time of No. 2 furnace was 5 minutes and 24 seconds, which was 36 seconds shorter than planned, and 1 minute and 5 seconds shorter than the average smelting time last year. After the workers of the second shift took over, they accepted the work experience of the previous shift, and strengthened contact with the Fourth Power Plant to obtain the power support from the Fourth Power Plant. In this way, the smelting time of No. 1 furnace was shortened to 4 minutes and 44 seconds; the smelting time of No. 2 furnace was shortened to 5 minutes and 19 seconds. The workers of the third shift heard that the previous two shifts had created new achievements, and also made up their minds to continue to expand the victory results of the previous two shifts. Because the workers continued to implement the new technical measures, the smelting time of No. 2 furnace was shortened to 5 minutes and 17 seconds. When they got off work in the evening, they counted: they completed 140% of the daily work plan, creating a new daily output record, which was 1% higher than the highest daily output since the opening of the furnace, and all the quality was qualified.
    On January 2, the leaders of the Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department summarized the experience of the workers in creating new records on New Year's Day, and issued a call: "Continue to implement the technical measures for the first quarter, consolidate the new achievements, and strive for greater victories." The workers responded to the call of the leaders, so that the smelting time was constantly shortened minute by minute. The smelting time of No. 1 furnace was shortened from 4 minutes and 44 seconds, 4 minutes and 43 seconds, to 4 minutes and 42 seconds; the smelting time of No. 2 furnace was also shortened from 5 minutes and 17 seconds to 5 minutes and 15 seconds. The average daily output from the 1st to the 4th reached 106% of the average daily output of the highest output month in the fourth quarter of 1953. Old worker Pan Tingliang said excitedly: "The smelting time is shortened minute by minute, the Five-Year Plan can be completed ahead of schedule, and the socialist society can arrive earlier."

    太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部职工
    今年元旦创造日产最高新纪录
    【本报讯】山西太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部职工，在一九五四年元旦，创造了建炉以来日产最高新纪录。
    电炉炼钢部的职工们学习国家过渡时期总路线以后，生产热情大大提高。年前，他们就把电炉进行了大修，制订了新的技术组织措施，做好了今年第一季度生产的准备工作。在除夕的联欢会上，工会主席号召大家说：“新年要有新的气象，我们要用新的思想，创造新纪录，使我们国家社会主义工业化早日到来。”职工们热烈响应了他的号召。
    元旦，工人们将工具、原材料等事先都作了很好的安排，他们在每一分钟都进行着紧张的劳动。结果，一号炉第一炉钢的冶炼时间是四点五十三分钟，比计划缩短了三十七分钟，比去年平均冶炼时间缩短了一点十五分钟。二号炉的冶炼时间是五点二十四分钟，比计划缩短了三十六分钟，比去年平均冶炼时间缩短了一点零五分钟。第二班的工人接班后，接受了上一班的工作经验，并加强和第四发电厂的联系，取得第四发电厂的电力支援。这样，一号炉的冶炼时间又缩短到四点四十四分钟；二号炉缩短到五点十九分钟。第三班工人听说前两班都创造了新的成绩，也下决心继续扩大前两班的胜利成果。由于工人们继续贯彻了新的技术措施，又使二号炉的冶炼时间缩短到五点十七分钟。到了晚上下班时，他们统计了一下：完成日作业计划百分之一百四十，创造了日产新纪录，比开炉以来最高日产量提高了百分之一，质量全部合格。
    一月二日，电炉炼钢部的领导上总结了职工们在元旦日创造新纪录的经验，提出号召：“继续贯彻第一季度的技术措施，巩固新的成绩，争取更大的胜利。”工人们响应了领导上的号召，使冶炼时间一分钟、一分钟地不断缩短，一号炉的冶炼时间由四点四十四分钟、四点四十三分钟，缩短到四点四十二分钟；二号炉也由五点十七分钟缩短到五点十五分钟。一日至四日的平均日产量，达到一九五三年第四季产量最高月份平均日产量的百分之一百零六。老工人潘廷良兴奋地说：“冶炼时间一分钟一分钟地缩短，五年计划就能提前完成，社会主义社会就能提早到来。”
