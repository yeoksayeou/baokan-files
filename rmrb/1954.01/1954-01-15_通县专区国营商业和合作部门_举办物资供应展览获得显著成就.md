    Tongxian Special District State-Owned Commerce and Cooperative Departments
    Hold Material Supply Exhibition and Achieve Significant Results
    The state-owned commercial departments of Tongxian Special District in Hebei Province and the Tongxian Special District Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation, from November 24th to December 31st last year, held a material supply exhibition in Poutou Township, Tongxian County, in conjunction with the grain procurement work, to further understand the needs of farmers for materials.
    In this material supply exhibition, commodities that were suitable for the needs of farmers sold very well. For example, fabrics accounted for 40% of the total sales, of which white cloth accounted for 28.9%. Among these fabrics, 17 types were produced by local state-owned industries in Gaoyang and Xianghe. These fabrics had been stagnant in urban sales for a long time, but after meeting the masses in rural areas this time, they were very popular among the masses.
    In the first five days, farmers raised over 100 types of goods that were out of stock. The leadership promptly made purchases based on the opinions of the masses. Of the 119 types of daily-use furniture that had already been sold, except for iron wire and nails, the rest were all handicraft products. The most popular were various iron pots, kitchen knives, and large vats. In the past, commercial departments only paid attention to the supply of fabrics and general merchandise. Through this exhibition, they learned that the masses urgently demanded the supply of daily-use furniture. For example, the Sihezhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the township had 40 member households buying goods, 24 buying cloth, 9 buying general merchandise, and 40 buying daily-use furniture. These daily-use furniture items were mainly handicraft products.
    In this material supply exhibition, general merchandise sales accounted for more than 16% of the total sales, with a total of 202 types sold. The largest items were thermos bottles, leggings, fleece clothing, green and white thread, and thick winter socks. Items such as records, bicycles, yarn, and nail clippers did not sell at all because they were not suitable for the needs of farmers.
    Through this material supply exhibition, a preliminary understanding was gained of the purchasing power of the masses and the distribution of proceeds from grain sales. According to surveys of villages such as Poutou, Sihezhuang, and Houchang, the proportion of surplus grain funds distributed by farmers is approximately as follows: about 20% is retained as cash, about 30% is used to purchase commodities, and about 50% is saved for the purchase of fertilizer and other production investments. This makes the material supply work have numbers, so a supply plan can be determined according to the needs of the masses.
    In rural areas, the selection and purchase of daily-use merchandise and fabrics are almost entirely controlled by women. This material supply exhibition facilitated women's selection and purchase of goods. Therefore, women became the main customers at the exhibition. Many old ladies also went to the exhibition to visit and purchase. When farmers saw the displayed daily-use furniture and all kinds of general merchandise, and fabrics of various colors and styles, they happily said: "The department store has come to the countryside!" Cadres were also educated in their practical work and realized that material supply work is not simply an economic work, but also a political work.
    At this material supply exhibition, pre-purchase and ordering methods were adopted for out-of-stock commodities that could not be supplied temporarily but would be available in the future. Pre-purchase means paying first and then delivering the goods, with prices following the decline but not the rise; ordering means paying 20% to 30% of the ordering deposit, and the ordered part also follows the decline but not the rise, with the remaining part calculated at the price when the goods are delivered. These two methods were very popular among the masses.

    通县专区国营商业和合作部门
    举办物资供应展览获得显著成就
    河北省通县专区国营商业部门和河北省供销合作总社通县专区办事处，从去年十一月二十四日到十二月三十一日，在通县铺头乡结合收购粮食工作举办了物资供应展览，进一步了解了农民需要物资的情况。
    这次物资供应展览中，凡是适合农民需要的商品都销售很多。如布匹占总销量的百分之四十，其中白布占百分之二十八点九，这些布当中有十七种是高阳、香河地方国营工业出产，这些布在城市里长期滞销，但这次在农村和群众见面以后，很受群众欢迎。
    在开始五天中，农民提出了缺货一百余种，领导上根据群众意见及时进行了采购。在已经售出的日用家具一百十九种中，除铁丝、钉子两种外，其他都是手工业产品。其中最畅销的是各种铁锅、菜刀以及大缸等。商业部门过去只注意供应布匹、百货，通过这次展览，知道群众迫切要求对日用家具的供应。如该乡四合庄农业生产合作社有四十户社员买货，买布的有二十四户，买百货的九户，买日用家具的四十户。这些日用家具主要是手工业产品。
    这次物资供应展览中，百货销量约占总售货额的百分之十六以上，共卖出二百零二种，其中大宗是暖水瓶、腿带、绒衣、青、白线、冬季厚线袜子等。像唱片、自行车、毛线、指甲刀等，因不适合农民需要，一点也没卖出。
    通过这次物资供应展览，初步了解了群众的购买能力与卖粮款项的支配情况。根据铺头、四合庄、后场等村的调查，农民支配余粮款的比例大约如下：留用现款约占百分之二十，购买商品约占百分之三十，储蓄起来用作购肥料及其他生产投资的约占百分之五十。这样使物资供应工作有了数，就可以根据群众需要确定供应计划。
    在农村，对日用百货和布匹的选购，差不多全由妇女掌握。这次物资供应展览便利了妇女们选购商品，因此，妇女成了展览会中的主要顾客。有很多老太太也到展览会上去参观选购。农民见到了陈列着的日用家具和应有尽有的百货，各色各样布匹，都高兴地说：“百货公司下乡了！”干部们在实际工作中也受到了教育，了解到物资供应工作不单纯是经济工作，也是政治工作。
    在这次物资供应展览会上，对一时不能供应而将来可供应的脱销商品，采取了预购和订购办法。预购是先缴款，后付货，价格随落不随涨；定购是交百分之二十到百分之三十的定购金，定购部分也是随落不随涨，其余部分按付货时价格计算。这两种办法群众都很欢迎。
