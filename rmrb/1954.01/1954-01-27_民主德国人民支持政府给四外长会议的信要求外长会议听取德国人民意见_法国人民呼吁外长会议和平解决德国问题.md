Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The people of the German Democratic Republic warmly welcome the letter from the government of the German Democratic Republic to the four foreign ministers, which requests that representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany participate in discussions on the German question.

Berlin's democratic newspapers expressed the sentiments of the broadest strata of the people of the German Democratic Republic. The "Forward" newspaper published an article stating: The step taken by the government of the German Democratic Republic is consistent with its policy of striving to ease international tensions. The Bonn regime and the West Berlin lackeys are attempting to poison the international atmosphere with all sorts of excuses in order to implement the plan to remilitarize West Germany and incorporate it into the aggressive "European Army," and to make the peaceful reunification of Germany impossible. The "Tribune," the central organ of the Free German Trade Union Federation, also pointed out: In this letter, the government of the German Democratic Republic expressed the desire of all peace-loving Germans to reach an all-German agreement.

Workers at the "Freiheit" state-owned factory in Berlin's Friedrichshain district passed a resolution at a mass meeting saying: "We deeply hope to establish a unified Germany on a democratic basis and maintain peace."

Thirteen hundred workers at the "October 7th" machine factory in Berlin's Weissensee district also unanimously supported the demands of the East German government and demanded that representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany jointly discuss the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and withdrawing all occupying forces.

The Halberstadt City Council wrote to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference saying: We must not fail to prevent a new war. Therefore, we hope that the conference will listen to the opinions of representatives of the peace-loving people from both parts of Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 26th: TASS Paris, 25th: A broad mass movement is underway throughout France to strive for the success of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. This movement is taking various forms, such as meetings, mass rallies, collecting signatures, sending telegrams and resolutions to members of parliament, and sending worker delegations to visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and cabinet meetings.

According to "l'Humanité," a delegation representing 250,000 residents of the Bouches-du-Rhône department recently came to Paris and visited the Prime Minister's Office, the National Assembly, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The delegation handed over to these bodies the resolutions passed by the people, demanding the rejection of the Paris and Bonn war treaties. The resolutions pointed out: These treaties will "hinder the success of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference."

The Municipal Council of Saint-Paul-lès-Durance in the Gard department declared in a resolution passed at a special meeting: "The Municipal Council earnestly requests the Minister of Foreign Affairs to pay attention to the will of the people and promote the success of the conference; this conference must peacefully resolve the German question."

　　民主德国人民支持政府给四外长会议的信要求外长会议听取德国人民意见
　　法国人民呼吁外长会议和平解决德国问题
    据新华社讯：德意志民主共和国人民热烈欢迎德意志民主共和国政府写给四国外长的信，这封信要求派德意志民主共和国与西德代表参加关于德国问题的讨论。
    柏林民主报纸表达了德意志民主共和国最广泛阶层的人民的情绪。“前进报”发表文章说：德意志民主共和国政府采取的这个步骤，和它尽力促使国际紧张局势缓和的政策是一脉相承的。而波恩政权以及西柏林仆从则企图用一切借口来毒化国际气氛，以便使西德重新军国主义化和使它加入侵略性的“欧洲军”的计划，并使得以和平方式重新统一德国无法实现。自由德国工会联合会中央机关报“论坛报”也指出：德意志民主共和国政府在这封信中表达了所有爱好和平的德国人对于获致全德协议的意愿。
    柏林腓特烈海恩区国营“费恩海茨”工厂的工人们在群众大会上通过决议说：“我们深深期望在民主的基础上建立一个统一的德国，并且保持和平。”
    柏林威森希区“十·七”机器制造厂的一千三百个工人也一致支持民主德国政府的要求，并且要求德意志民主共和国与西德代表就缔结对德和约问题与撤退所有占领军问题共同进行讨论。
    哈尔伯斯塔德市议会写信给四国外长会议说：我们决不能不设法防止新的战争。所以，我们希望会议听取德国两部分爱好和平的人民代表的意见。
   【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十五日讯：法国全国各地正展开一个广泛的群众运动，争取柏林四国外长会议的成功。这个运动采取了种种不同的形式，如会议、群众集会、征集签名、向国会议员拍发电报和决议、派工人代表团访问外交部和内阁会议等。
    据“人道报”报道，代表罗尼河口省二十五万居民的一个代表团最近已来到巴黎，访问了总理办公厅、国民议会和外交部。代表团把人民通过的决议交给了这些机关，要求拒绝巴黎和波恩战争条约。决议指出：这些条约将“妨碍四国外长会议获得成功”。
    加尔省圣保罗—拉哥斯特市政委员会在一次特别会议上通过的一项决议中宣称：“市政委员会恳切要求外交部长注意人民的意愿，促进会议的成功；这次会议必须和平解决德国问题。”
