    Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: Recently, Western European countries have shown an increasingly urgent demand for expanding East-West trade. Trade relations between these countries and the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies are continuing to develop.

    This situation led Pearson, chairman of the American Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, to predict an increase in East-West trade when looking ahead to trade trends in 1954 at the end of 1953.

    According to a spokesperson for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the organization's Executive Secretary, Gunnar Myrdal, began touring Western European capitals on January 6th and will later visit Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague to explore the possibility of holding an East-West trade conference.

    Reuters reported: The Confederation of British Industries, the largest representative body of the British business community, with 7,000 member companies and 290 trade associations, is calling for the expansion of East-West trade. The organization's East-West Trade Group recently drafted a confidential report stating that trade with the Soviet Union and People's Democracies "should not be restricted by political considerations." The report calls for "exploring the full potential opportunities that currently exist for East-West trade" and points out that if Britain does not seize these opportunities, they will be "snatched away by competitors." Following this, a trade delegation of forty British businessmen is preparing to go to Moscow immediately. Reuters said: This is "the first attempt" after the Confederation of British Industries called for expanding East-West trade.

    Italian businessmen and manufacturers also held a meeting in Rome not long ago to discuss the possibility of expanding East-West trade. The meeting passed a resolution calling for the restoration of free trade with all countries without exception.

    In the past month or so, Finland, Sweden, Norway, France, and Belgium have respectively signed barter protocols or trade agreements with the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, or Poland. The Associated Press said: Debtor nations in the European Payments Union, such as France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, are "particularly keen to conduct more trade with the communist bloc."

    According to American news agencies, one of the reasons why Western countries have been vying to expand East-West trade recently is that these countries are worried that their fragile economies, which are heavily dependent on the United States, will not be able to withstand the heavy blow of the looming American economic crisis, and are therefore seeking ways out. The Associated Press said: Western Europe's "biggest concern is that the United States may face a recession." United Press said: The British business community is calling for vigorous East-West trade in order to "offset the adverse consequences of a possible recession in the United States in 1954." This situation has caused great unease in the United States. The Associated Press said: "The United States has recently gone to great lengths to dispel fears abroad that the United States will have difficult times."

### 西欧国家迫切要求扩展东西方贸易

    西欧国家迫切要求扩展东西方贸易
   【新华社七日讯】最近，西欧各国对于扩展东西方贸易的要求越来越迫切了。这些国家和苏联及东欧人民民主国家之间的贸易关系，正在继续发展。
    这种情况使得国际商会美国委员会主席皮尔逊在一九五三年年底展望一九五四年贸易趋向时，预料东西方之间的贸易将有所增加。
    据联合国欧洲经济委员会发言人宣布，这个组织的执行秘书古纳尔·密达尔从一月六日开始周游西欧各国首都，以后还要访问莫斯科、华沙和布拉格，以便探讨举行东西方贸易会议的可能性。
    路透社说：英国企业界的最大代表机构，拥有会员七千家公司和二百九十个贸易协会的英国工业联合会，要求扩展东西方贸易。这个组织的东西方贸易小组最近草拟了一项机密报告，认为和苏联及人民民主国家的贸易“不应因政治考虑而受到任何限制”。报告要求“探测目前存在的东西方贸易的充分潜在机会”，并且指出：这种机会如果英国不抓紧，就会被“竞争者夺去”。接着，由四十个英国商人组成的一个贸易代表团就准备马上去莫斯科。路透社说：这是英国工业联合会号召扩大东西方贸易后的“第一个尝试。”
    意大利的商人和制造商不久以前也在罗马举行了会议，讨论扩大东西方贸易的可能性。会议通过了决议，要求一无例外地恢复和所有国家的自由贸易。
    最近一个多月以来，芬兰、瑞典、挪威、法国及比利时已经分别和苏联、德意志民主共和国或波兰签订了换货议定书或贸易协定。美联社说：欧洲支付同盟中的债务国如法国、意大利和英国等，都“特别希望和共产党集团进行更多的贸易”。
    据美国通讯社透露，近来西方国家之所以竞相要求扩展东西方贸易，其原因之一是：这些国家担心它们那种在很大程度上依赖美国的脆弱经济，将经不起日益逼近的美国经济危机的沉重打击，因此正在纷纷寻求出路。美联社说：西欧“最大的顾虑是：美国也许会面临萧条”。合众社说：英国企业界要求大力进行东西方贸易，是为了要“抵消美国在一九五四年可能发生的萧条的不良后果”。这种情况使美国大为不安。美联社说：“美国最近为了消除国外担心美国将有艰难时期的恐惧，曾大费周折。”
