　　Post-Armistice Korea
    Chen Yi
    The Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea was sent after the armistice, so I would like to focus on reporting some of the situation in Korea after the armistice to the people of the motherland. Of course, this topic is quite large, and whether I can report it well is a question. Let me start with how the Korean people welcomed us.
    The Yalu River Bridge is now completely different. Special trains can pass over the bridge during the day. The enemy's dream of destroying this bridge with bombing and strafing to sever the combat friendship forged with blood between the Chinese and Korean people can never be realized. At 4:00 PM on October 20, 1953, the special train carrying our delegation arrived at the bridge. Before the train had even crossed the bridge, we could already hear the shouts of "Manse" (Long Live) "Manse," mixed with the songs "The East is Red" and "General Kim Il-sung's Song." Look, stretch your head out of the car window as much as you can: rows of people, rows of flags, rows of flowers, and flower nets and ropes woven from flowers, held and pulled by young workers, students, women, and soldiers, like the evening glow of the setting sun. The flags fluttered in the wind, and we couldn't help but shout, and our General Commander He Long quickly took off his hat and stuck it out the window to greet the welcomers. After the car stopped, we were all pushed out of the car. Some were surrounded, some were carried, and some were thrown up continuously. Flowers were everywhere on our heads and bodies. We walked out of the ranks and were pushed back up again, repeatedly, some as many as twenty times. They all wanted to see their comrades-in-arms—the envoys of Mao Zedong, comrades-in-arms and envoys whom they hadn't seen clearly in the past, in the darkness and haste.
    "Look, comrades, look to your heart's content, let us have a grand get-together with you at the station!"
    The band played more loudly, and the people at the station danced and sang in chorus; even those who didn't know how joined in, shouting with the most excited mood: "Long live Kim Il-sung!" "Long live Mao Zedong!"
    This scene continued until dark, until the train's whistle sounded a long blast, and everyone finally let go and allowed us to board.
    On the train, those who came to greet us—Kim Cheon-hae, Chairman of the Presidium of the Fatherland United Democratic Front of Korea, Kim Min-san, Minister of the Social Department of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Choi Young, Deputy Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, Deputy Minister of the Interior, and other responsible persons from industry, agriculture, youth, and women—gathered around in the dining car, each finding their conversational partner. Before one o'clock, we were still in two countries, who knew who? But only an hour had passed, only one river had been crossed, and people were like old acquaintances from many years ago. Language barriers were not a major difficulty, and everyone expressed what they wanted to say in their hearts.
      "China-Korea brotherly nation," "international big family," "combat friendship"—these words, which are often seen in newspapers in the motherland, were all realistically and vividly embodied in this dining car. Moonlight shone in from the car window, and looking along the moonlight, the bomb craters scattered like beans by enemy planes on both sides of the railway aroused our anger and awakened our memories. We Chinese all unanimously said:
    "The armistice has been signed! But the wounds inflicted on the Korean people (no, the people of the whole world, especially us Chinese people) by the enemy have not yet healed, and the enemy is still trying to ignite the flames of war. One day, the enemy will have to repay this blood debt."
    This anger, this memory, immediately reminded us of our mission in Korea. We were here to慰问 [express sympathy and solicitude to], but at the same time, we were here to encourage them.
    I remember the Chairman of the Wonsan People's Committee once told us: "Before the war, Wonsan was a very beautiful city, close to the sea, with a good climate, 43,000 Western-style houses, and a population of 130,000. After the outbreak of the war, the US imperialists used it as a target, shelling from the sea and bombing from the air, resulting in great losses in terms of material and human resources."
    Listening to this, I was calculating in my heart how much a house was worth, which could be calculated; but life, even just one life, could not be calculated by any clever mathematician. And Korea is more than just one Wonsan! This time, because we came after the armistice, we could travel during the day, even on the front lines, and see everything at our leisure. Under Old Bald Mountain, there wasn't a single tree or a single branch, let alone a single leaf. The bomb craters had all turned into pools of water, and unexploded fragmentation bombs were vaguely visible in the pools. Choi Young, Deputy Director of the Operations Bureau of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army, who accompanied us on the tour, couldn't help but shed tears after seeing this. And this scene is not just Old Bald Mountain. The entire military demarcation line, stretching for hundreds of miles, where is it not like this? The losses suffered by the Korean people cannot be calculated by any clever mathematician either.
    We, the envoys sent by the Chinese people, could not hold back our tears when we saw this scene. Comrade Shao Shiping went to visit an orphan in one place. The village where the orphan lived was completely destroyed in the war. Only one orphan was left out of more than forty households, and this orphan had also had a leg blown off and half of his right hand blown away. Grieving for the dead and sympathizing with the living, Comrade Shao Shiping couldn't bear his own cold and took off his cotton-padded coat and gave it to the orphan.
    How many orphans like this are left behind by the crimes of the US-Li gang in Korea?
    The sacrifices of the Korean people cannot be explained with numbers.
    We went to the home of martyr Park Jae-geun. Volunteer soldiers built a house for his family to repay his great spirit of internationalism. We saw his wife and his two daughters. The older daughter could say "Chinese uncle, you've worked hard," but the younger daughter couldn't say anything. However, she didn't refuse to let us hold her. His wife was so excited to see us that she held our hands and wouldn't let go. A large crowd of people immediately gathered in the street. This is all because martyr Park Jae-geun used his own body to cover our wounded volunteer soldiers. He sacrificed himself, but the wounded volunteer soldiers were saved.
    "The wounded have already been wounded once, I can't let them be wounded a second time."
    This is the depth of martyr Park Jae-geun's noble internationalist thought.
    At Changjin Lake, an old Korean woman's son sacrificed himself in the Fatherland Liberation War. She was sad and often told her daughter-in-law. Wasn't the daughter-in-law sad? Who wouldn't be sad when their husband died! But she knew what was what in her heart. One day, the mother was telling her her feelings as usual, and the daughter-in-law couldn't bear it any longer and told her mother:
    "Mom, open the window and look outside. The bodies of volunteer soldiers are also buried on the shores of Changjin Lake! They are Chinese, and they shed their blood for us, for our Korea. Your son is Korean, and he sacrificed himself for his own country, for his own people, which is what he should do. If you still have a son, he should go to war too."
    From then on, the mother was no longer sad, and both mother-in-law and daughter-in-law became labor models in the village. Under the influence of their deeds, another old farmer in Changjin Lake specially killed a chicken when he heard that we were coming, and hired someone to send it first; on the one hand, he was afraid that he would not be able to keep up because he couldn't walk, and on the other hand, he wanted the person he hired to arrive first to send us a letter so that he could wait for him.
    Of course, we waited to meet him.
    A more conservative Catholic was skeptical of our brotherly friendship. This time, he welcomed us in South Hamgyong Province. Our representative held all the children who welcomed us and walked for seven miles. He was moved and said:
    "The Chinese people are truly sincere to us. The children are so dirty, but the Chinese friends didn't seem to see it. The children's feet dirtied their clothes, but they didn't even look at them."
    He confessed to the Chairman of the Provincial People's Committee his mistaken idea that he did not believe that there was true brotherly friendship between the two countries.
    Old lady Yoon Ok-ki said: "I wish I could tear off my white hair and weave it into straw shoes to give to Mao Zedong to express my love for China."
    One county sent us a unit of 230,000 cubic meters of wood during the war to build fortifications, and sent us more than 300,000 catties of vegetables. 127 people were sacrificed or injured while rescuing the wounded.
  Comrades, when I report these to you, I can't help but recall what a division commander told me when I came here for the second time two years ago:
    "North Korea, a country with a population of 12 million, is facing such a brutal enemy, but they have never been discouraged. When one falls, another stands up, and they still do everything in their power to support us. Comrade, this country, this army is strong enough. It is also the most honorable to be their comrade-in-arms."
    Therefore, I feel that it is very timely and appropriate for our country to sign an economic and cultural cooperation agreement with them, following the Soviet Union, and to provide them with 8 trillion RMB yuan in gratuitous assistance.
    I also feel that it is not without reason that our volunteer soldiers sacrificed themselves so bravely for the Korean people. In the depths of their hearts, there are noble seeds of internationalism. Like Sun Zhanyuan, both of his legs were broken by artillery shells, but he crawled 300 meters and covered Yi Caixue to hit four firing points, and finally died together with the enemy. Six American devils were lying next to him. There is no need to mention Huang Jiguang. Li Jiafa's heroic deeds in the Battle of Jincheng were the same as Huang Jiguang's. He threw himself on the enemy's machine gun nest with his chest, blocking the bullets fired frantically by the enemy. After the sacrifice, his hands still tightly grasped the soil at the mouth of the bunker, and his eyes were half-open, watching the huge stone on the main peak of Jiaoyanshan. During the summer campaign last year, when our army captured "Da Wuming Mountain" on the east bank of the North Han River, the vanguard was blocked by a barbed wire fence. The assault platoon leader ordered two demolitionists to blow it up, but unfortunately, they were both wounded in the middle. The troops were temporarily suppressed by the enemy's artillery fire near the barbed wire fence and could not move forward. The platoon leader was anxious. If they didn't rush up quickly, they would lose the opportunity, and the enemy would run away. The follow-up troops were rushing up, and if the troops gathered there, they would definitely increase casualties. At this critical moment, squad leader Li Yunfeng of the rocket launcher squad ran up. Without asking the platoon leader for instructions, he took a few steps and threw himself on the barbed wire fence, shouting: "Comrades! For victory, pass over me!" "Comrades, rushing up is victory, for victory, pass over me quickly!" In the end, he was covered in injuries. His comrades persuaded him not to throw himself on the barbed wire again, but he firmly refused and said: "Comrades, hurry up, time is tight, victory is important!" When he was too seriously injured to continue and was rescued to a bunker, the first thing he asked when he woke up was: "Go and observe, have our troops rushed up?"
    There are thousands upon thousands of such soldiers in the volunteer army, and they have more than 300,000 major and minor meritorious services.
    And the generals, the commanders, are even more amazing. Every victory in the Korean War is inseparable from them! From the senior commanders to a platoon leader, when attacking a position, the commanders had to go to the front line to personally deploy, study repeatedly, and educate up and down repeatedly, until even a squad leader felt confident before starting. And the coordination of infantry, artillery, and tanks was truly achieved, as the infantry phone called, and the artillery shells flew, and the rocket launchers, as the soldiers said, passed by with a swishing sound like flowing water.
    Tanks are a new type of force, but they have also created new miracles. When we were attacking Jiaoyanshan, one of our tanks was trapped in the mud and could not move, and it was very exposed. However, it was necessary to use it in the battle. The commander told them to hide and wait for orders. They hid it well. When the commander gave an order, their artillery fire was accurate and eliminated three enemy firing points made of tanks. But they were exposed, they were still stuck in the mud, and the enemy would definitely retaliate. What should they do? They used their wisdom and began to increase the throttle, letting the sound resound through the valley, and then slowly reducing it, as if the tank had already driven away. The sound gradually became inaudible, and the enemy's artillery fire prepared to hit this tank was fired in the direction of the barely audible sound.
    In this way, the tank was still safely parked, and soon it drove out of the mud.
    There was no amazing person in command here. This was the bravery and resourcefulness of the soldiers. And this has become a trend in the volunteer army.
    Our commanders are good at using and improving these bravery and resourcefulness, so they have great faith in their soldiers.
      "Still bitter?" comrades will definitely ask this question. This is my third time in Korea, and I specially stayed overnight in a company. They have come out of the tunnels, and the past situation of insufficient sunlight and insufficient air has completely changed. They are turning barren mountains into paradise, building houses, building playgrounds, growing vegetables, that is to say, they now have places to stand and exercise when they go out. They are trying their best to improve their lives, and sometimes they also hold weekend hometown opera evenings. The soldiers are satisfied, not thinking it is bitter. Some soldiers even said: "We must cherish the life during the fighting period." Therefore, they often practice climbing mountains at night and packing their bags. Some soldiers dig their own bunkers and go to explore them in the middle of the night, because they know that their sacred task is to "vigilantly monitor the enemy," and the enemy is not far from them, four kilometers—eight li. The so-called military demarcation line is just like this; in modern warfare, this is not far, and any weapon can be fired over; what's more, the enemy is still building fortifications and conducting live ammunition exercises every day, and the correction planes, which the soldiers call "old sick men," are still flying around for reconnaissance every day! In some places, you need binoculars to see the enemy's activities, while in other places, you don't need binoculars, you can see them with the naked eye.
    If you look at Panmunjom again, the shameless tricks played by the enemy, especially their brutal behavior towards the prisoners, how can our comrades relax their vigilance? The soldiers are very vigilant, because they deeply understand: "Peace must be defended with the guns in our hands."
    I remember the slogan welcoming us at the People's Army position was:
    "Chinese comrades, our task is first vigilance, second vigilance, and third still vigilance!"
    At an artillery position of the People's Army that we visited on the east coast, the gunners' actions were very rapid, and they could counterattack the enemy at any time.
    What we saw in the Imjin River, Mt. Osong, and Mt. Jiaoyan, especially when we talked with their commanders, we were very relieved, and we were not afraid of the US-Li gang re-igniting the flames of war.
    The soldiers understand very well, and the generals especially understand.
    "Defending Korea is defending the motherland!"
    "Protecting Korea is protecting the motherland!"
    "The road on Mt. Osong not only leads to Beijing, but the hearts of the people on Mt. Osong are also closely connected with Beijing."
    And the motherland is now carrying out socialist industrialization, and Beijing is directing this construction. The criminals on Wall Street do not want our construction. This is why the soldiers of the People's Army must be vigilant again and again, and our volunteer soldiers and generals must resolutely defend Korea and protect the motherland.
    The motherland makes our volunteer soldiers so selfless, and the volunteer soldiers are full of strength when they think of the motherland. There is nothing they don't think of the motherland, and there is nothing they don't appreciate about the motherland. When the autumn wind rises, they think of the motherland; when the cotton-padded clothes arrive, they are grateful to the motherland; when the family letter arrives, they think of the motherland; when the allowance is increased, they send money home and are grateful to the motherland; not to mention the airplanes and cannons donated by the motherland, which make their battles much easier.
    It is very reasonable for the soldiers to call the motherland their mother. The motherland in their hearts is—Chairman Mao, Tiananmen, Anshan Iron and Steel, wives, and children. They are fighting for these.
    Is it limited to this? It is not limited to this! Korea, the Korea I mentioned above, like the motherland, also inspires them to fight.
    When the news of martyr Park Jae-geun's sacrifice reached Shangganling, a commander of a regimental headquarters slammed his fist hard on the table made of canned food boxes:
    "Fight bravely for the Koreans until I stop breathing."
    This time, we met Choi Jianguo, the head of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army who participated in the Battle of Shangganling. He still has not forgotten Park Jae-geun. Even on the day he met us, he went to his house to see him once.
    Today, Korea has an armistice, and we can march and go to the front during the day. We have time and opportunity to talk in detail with the Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and our volunteer soldiers. How can we say that China and Korea can be separated? And how can we say who helped whom? And how can we say who should thank whom?
    Our destiny is one, our task is one, our sacrifice is also one, and our victory is even more one.
    This is the "special friendship" spoken of by a division commander of the Korean Air Force, and it is also the "friendship, like a family" spoken of by Kim Il-sung's secretary He Yangtian, and it is even more the words of old man Kim Cheon-ryong from Supung-ri, Hwacheon County: "I would rather the Yalu River water run dry than forget the friendship between China and Korea."
    It is precisely this special friendship, this friendship like a family, this friendship that we would rather the Yalu River water run dry than forget, that enabled us to get through the most difficult days of the war and beat the enemy so that he had to sign the armistice agreement.
    Our good days are stable because the Korean people, the People's Army, and our Volunteer Army resisted US imperialism, and socialist industrialization has a reliable guarantee because of this great driving force.
    Here, it is not difficult for us to think of why sixty-three soldiers in one of our units recognized an old Korean woman as their mother, and when the old woman met our representative, she said that she would go to China to see her children in the future.
    Why did four members of the Democratic Youth League in Im Nam-ri, Changdo County, Choi Yong-joo, Song Joong-geun, Jo Ga-ko, and Seo Seok-beom, organize a stretcher team and carry the wounded back and forth six times in the artillery fire, even though the leader of the village did not approve of them carrying stretchers because they were young? When the Korean liaison officer of the Volunteer Army advised them: "You are young, it is dangerous to go to the blockade zone!" They still refused to listen and said: "The volunteer soldiers are fighting a desperate battle with the enemy in front, can't we carry stretchers in the rear? Don't look at us being young, if the government approves, we will immediately join the People's Army." When they were persuaded to eat, they refused to eat. This scene deeply moved a seriously wounded person, who said: "Even the little Korean brothers are supporting us, how can we not win?"
    Why, in the village of Ucheon-ri, where only two households were left after the enemy destroyed it, did our volunteer soldiers rebuild this village in seven months, increasing it from two households to sixty-two households, with more than 900 people?
    As for repairing houses, repairing schools, repairing offices—even repairing cinemas, we were proactive, and the Korean comrades were very enthusiastic. Wherever we went, wherever there were volunteer soldiers stationed, we repaired them.
    Why is this? Because they all understand that the task assigned to them by the people of the motherland after the armistice is: to rebuild their homes for the Korean people.
    In Pyongyang, as soon as our engineering corps arrived, they not only accepted the task of rebuilding Pyongyang, but also composed a song for the whole corps to sing:
    Steel scaffolding is erected on Moranbong,
    A magnificent bridge is built over the Taedong River;
    Transport vehicles are busy day and night,
    People at work are in high spirits;
    Pyongyang is full of pleasant construction scenes,
    Volunteer soldiers come to Pyongyang,
    And heal the wounds of war with the Korean people.
    Rebuild the destroyed buildings,
    Widen the damaged roads,
    Fill in the bomb craters, build factories,
    Remove broken bricks and tiles, build houses,
    Dedicate great strength to the Korean people,
    Let the suffering people get happy times early.
    We go to the battlefield side by side during the war,
    In construction, we sweat together;
    The flowers of friendship bloom,
    Our unity is unparalleled,
    Marshal Kim Il-sung leads us,
    Pyongyang will be more beautiful than before the war.
    We are building the heroic Pyongyang,
    Just like building Beijing,
    We are building the heroic Pyongyang,
    Just like building Beijing.
    The soldiers and cadres are building with this mood, so the Taedong River pontoon bridge was completed seven days ahead of schedule, and when the ribbon-cutting ceremony was about to be held, because the wood was not available in time, there were still sixty meters of bridge surface without planks, the soldiers demolished their own houses.
    This time, I personally saw our soldiers working so hard for the war and for the Korean people, and working with great pleasure. The soldiers said: There is nothing they can't do, except give birth to children. Look, carpenters, blacksmiths, bricklayers, tiling craftsmen, digging tunnels surpassing any prospecting miners in the country, so Qu Yaoli also said: "After seeing the selfless labor of the volunteer soldiers, I feel that my labor enthusiasm has not been fully exerted, and I am determined to learn from the volunteer soldiers, and I must strive to increase the yield of cotton per mu to 1,100 catties when I return to China."
    The Korean people's spirit of recovery and construction is the same as the volunteer soldiers' spirit of fighting and working. The restoration of Pyongyang that we saw is truly changing every other day. Although it is just ordinary houses, there are countless of them. The lights at night are no longer scattered, and the days of darkness are over. The most beautiful "buses" are running on the road, and the rubble has been completely cleaned up. The steel plant is recovering. A steel-smelting furnace that had one machine buried underground, one machine moved to Manpo, and one machine destroyed has been put together and restarted, producing 15 tons of iron each time. The spinning mill increased from 6,000 spindles to 13,000 in one month. It is truly amazing to repair a two-story dormitory to accommodate 1,100 of us in seven days!
    How are they working? Let's take the restoration of a film factory as an example: 25 rooms, the superior did not give any materials, no tools, no technicians, everything relied on self-reliance. From the factory director to all employees were mobilized, the men built 20 rooms, and the women built 5 rooms. They went to the ruins to find steel bars, bricks, wood, and wire nails, requiring each person to collect 700 pieces in half a month. One comrade collected 3,000 pieces in three times; without tools, everything relied on hands, moving stones with hands, mud walls with hands; finally, there were no tiles to cover the roof, and everyone went to a place 100 kilometers away from Pyongyang to find thin stones, cut them out piece by piece, and transported them back to Pyongyang piece by piece. By the time we returned to Pyongyang from the front, they had already moved in to work.
    And these are artists who don't understand architecture!
    A woman named Luo Ailan, her husband was killed, leaving behind a child, she was also sick, but she still built two houses herself. She was seriously ill for seven days in the middle, because the roof of the house had not been built, she lived in the house without a roof for seven days, and then built it after she recovered. When our reporter went to interview her, she had already furnished it comfortably and put up her previous stage photos.
    Park Gap-dong, a worker at a steel plant, never left his plant. When the enemy bombed, he moved to a small gully behind the plant and built a cave to live in. He saw the bombing every day, but he went in to move things every day, saying as he walked: "You dog thing, bomb it! In the future, I will build an even better one than this and piss you off!" As soon as the armistice was signed, there was a shortage of refractory bricks for building the factory. He went to the ashes of the refractory bricks in the original factory to find broken refractory bricks, crushed them into powder, and finally made bricks, which accelerated the restoration.
    Soldiers, prisoners of war who returned from Panmunjom, have all invested in construction. Walking around Pyongyang, you can't see a single idler, especially women. Wherever there is construction, there they are; not only can you see female anti-aircraft gunners, female tank drivers, and female aviators on the battlefield, but you can also see women at construction sites, in steel plants, and at traffic posts; and in the countryside, according to Korean comrades, Korean women would not use a plow before, but now they can. Quite a few female comrades have also emerged as cadres equivalent to the county committee level in China. It is they who led the people to support the war during the war, and they are now leading mutual aid and cooperation after the war. In a village near Pyongyang called Munhwa-ri, 77 laborers (including 59 women and 18 men) formed a mutual aid team. They said: "Instead of helping them, it is better to organize together." In order to promote this movement, the government has issued more than 4,000 heads of cattle in Gangwon Province alone.
    Seeing these, we can only be in awe! Our current construction conditions are many times better than Korea's, what can't we build!
    In addition, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and the entire peace camp, the Korean comrades themselves said: "We are guaranteed victory, and we are guaranteed recovery." Therefore, they are not worried at all. They are neither afraid of not being able to recover, nor are they afraid of the US imperialists re-igniting the war. They all have a unified will, as Premier Kim often tells them:
    "Bomb! We will build it even better!"
    They themselves often say: The power of people is infinite, and there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome.
    We all have great faith in their perseverance.
    The volunteer soldiers also believe it, so they fight together and build together. Next year, the volunteer soldiers plan to contract with them to help them with spring plowing in their駐地 [place of stationing]. In this way, the Korean people's basic recovery after the war can be guaranteed, and this is the foundation of the recovery of Korea—after the great war, to give the people a chance to breathe.
    The volunteer soldiers—the most outstanding sons and daughters of our motherland—have fought for three years, and they are very satisfied with themselves. They said: "Three years of fighting have not been in vain, we have defended the independence of Korea, and we have also defended the construction of the motherland." This is the true meaning of victory in their hearts.
    Therefore, they have no objection to continuing to stay in Korea after the armistice and waiting for the complete settlement of the Korean issue. Their hope for the motherland is two sentences:
    "The affairs outside the gate are contracted by us,
      The people of the motherland can rest assured to implement the general line."
    And their hope for our great leader Chairman Mao is that he will always be healthy and not get sick at all.
    This is also the mood of every Korean people. They often say: The victory of China's construction is the victory of the Korean people's construction. They care about Mao Zedong as much as they care about Marshal Kim Il-sung. When talking about Marshal Kim Il-sung, they must talk about Chairman Mao, and many people are reading Chairman Mao's works.
    The US imperialists, the Syngman Rhee gang, are probably only going to stare forever at our victory, at our construction, and at their own final failure!

　　停战后的朝鲜
    陈沂
    中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团是停战后派去的，所以我想着重的向祖国人民报告一下停战后朝鲜的一些情况。当然，这个题目是比较大的，我能不能报告好是个问题。我先从朝鲜人民欢迎我们谈起。
    鸭绿江桥现在已经完全变样了，专车白天就可以从桥上通过，敌人梦想用轰炸、扫射破坏这座桥来达到隔断我们中朝两国人民用血结成的战斗友谊的目的是永远也不能实现了。一九五三年十月二十日下午四点钟，载着我们慰问团的专车开到了桥上，当火车还没有走完桥，我们就已经老远的听到“满赛”（万岁）“满赛”的欢呼声，夹杂着“东方红”、“金日成将军之歌”的歌声。看吧，把你的头从车窗尽情的伸出去看吧：人的行列，旗的行列，花的行列，和用花织成的花网、花绳，在一些年青的工人、学生、妇女、士兵手中拿着，牵着，像落日的晚霞一样。风吹的旗子呼呼的发响，我们也情不自禁的喊起来，我们的贺龙总团长也赶快把帽子摘下来伸出窗外向欢迎的人招呼。车停后，我们全都被拥下车了，有的被拥着，有的被抬着，有的被连续的抛起来，头上，身上到处是花，在行列中，我们走出去又被拥上来，反复了好多次，有的反复了二十次，他们都要看他们的战友——毛泽东的使者，这些战友，这些使者，过去在黑夜，在匆忙中是没有看得很真的。
    “看吧，同志们，尽情的看吧，我们同你们在车站上大联欢”！
    乐队更响亮的奏起了乐曲，车站上的人跳着，舞着，合唱着；不会的也合在一起，用最兴奋的心情喊：“万岁金日成！”“万岁毛泽东！”
    这情景一直继续到天黑，一直等到火车的汽笛发出长鸣，大家才算松手，让我们上车。
    在车上，迎接我们的人，朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线议长团议长金天海，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会社会部部长金民山，朝鲜人民军总政治局副局长，内务省副相和其他工、农、青、妇方面的负责人，又在餐车上围起来，各人找了各人的对象说话。一点钟以前，还在两个国家，有谁认识谁呢，不过才过一个钟头，才过一条江，人们就像好多年前就已相识一样，语言不通，没有成为很大困难，各自心里要表达的话都表达了。
      “中朝兄弟之邦”、“国际大家庭”、“战斗友谊”，这些在祖国常常可以从报纸上见到的字眼，都很现实而又生动的体现在这个餐车上了。月光从车窗射进来，顺着月光望去，敌机投弹像撒豆子一样在铁道两旁满布的弹坑，激起了我们大家的愤怒和唤起了我们大家的回忆，我们中国人大家都不约而同的在讲：
    “停战了！但是敌人给予朝鲜人民（不，全世界人民，首先是我们中国人民）的创伤还没有恢复，敌人还在企图燃起战火，终有一天，要敌人来偿还这笔血债的。”
    这个愤怒，这个回忆，使我们自己立即想起我们这次来朝鲜的任务，我们是来慰问他们，但同时我们又是来鼓舞他们。
    记得元山市人民委员会委员长曾告诉我们：“元山战前是一个很美丽的城市，靠海，气候好，有四万三千幢洋房，十三万人口，战争爆发后，美帝一直当个目标，海上炮击，飞机轰炸，物力和人力的损失都是很大的。”
    听着，我自己心里就在盘算，一幢房子的价值如何，这是可以计算得出来的；而生命，那怕只一个生命，任何高明的数学家，是没法计算出来的。朝鲜何止一个元山市呢！这次，我们因为是在停战后来，白天行车，即是在前线也看得很从容，老秃山下，没有一根树有一条树枝，更谈不到见到一片树叶，炸弹坑都变成水池了，水池中还隐现着没有爆炸的杀伤弹，陪我们一起参观的朝鲜人民军最高司令部作战局副局长崔英，看罢不禁潜然泪下。这情景又何止一个老秃山，整个军事分界线，绵亘数百里，何处不是这样呢？朝鲜人民所遭受的损失，同样是任何高明的数学家所不能计算出来的。
    我们，中国人民所派的使者，看到这种情景，也是止不住我们的热泪。邵式平同志到一个地方去访问一个孤儿，那个孤儿所住的村庄在战争中全部被炸毁，四十多户人家就只剩下这样一个孤儿，而这个孤儿还被炸断了一条腿，右手被炸去半截。悼死者，痛生者，邵式平同志顾不了自己的寒冷把棉袄脱给了孤儿。
    美李匪帮在朝鲜犯罪留下的孤儿又何止这样一个呢？
    朝鲜人民的牺牲是没法用数字来说明的。
    我们走到朴在根烈士的家里，志愿军战士为了报答他的国际主义伟大精神，为他家属盖了房子，我们看见他的妻子和他的两个女儿，大女儿会叫“中国叔叔，辛苦，”小女儿什么也不会叫，她却不拒绝我们抱她，他的妻子见到我们兴奋得就是双手拉着不放，街上的人立刻也围了一大群。这还不是因为朴在根烈士生前用自己的肉体盖住了我们志愿军的伤员，他牺牲了，志愿军的伤员却保留住了。
    “伤员已经受了一次伤，我不能让他再受第二次伤。”
    这就是朴在根烈士崇高的国际主义思想的深处。
    在长津湖，一个朝鲜老太太，她的儿子在卫国战争中牺牲了，她悲哀，经常向她的儿媳诉说，儿媳不悲哀吗？那有自己的丈夫死了不悲哀的！但是她心里有数。一天，妈妈也是跟往常一样向她诉说衷情，媳妇忍不住了，告诉妈妈：
    “妈妈，你推开窗子往外看看吧，长津湖畔也曾埋过志愿军的尸体呀！他们是中国人，为了我们，为了我们朝鲜，他们流了血。你的儿子是朝鲜人，是为他自己的祖国，是为他自己的人民，牺牲了是应该的；如果你老人家还有儿子的话，还应该去作战。”
    妈妈从此再也不悲哀了，婆媳俩都成了村的劳动模范。在他们的事迹影响下，长津湖的另外一个老农民，听着我们去了，特地杀了一只鸡，雇一个人先送来；这一方面是他自己走不动怕赶不上，另一方面要雇的这个人先到，给我们送一个信，好等他。
    当然，我们等着他见面了。
    一个较为守旧的天主教徒，他是怀疑我们兄弟般的友谊的。这次在咸镜南道欢迎我们，我们的代表抱着所有欢迎我们的孩子一直走了七里路。他感动了，他说：
    “中国人民对我们真是真情，孩子们多脏呀，中国朋友好像没有看到似的，孩子的脚脏了他们的衣服，他们连看都没有看一眼。”
    他向道人民委员会委员长坦白了他不相信两国有真正的兄弟友谊的错误想法。
    尹玉琦老太太说：“恨不得把我的一头白发扯下来编成草鞋送给毛泽东，以表我爱中国的心意。”
    一个郡在战争中就送了我们一个部队二十三万立方米的木料修工事，送给我们的菜是三十多万斤，因抢救伤员而牺牲、而受伤的是一百二十七人。
  同志们，当我向你们报告到这些的时候，我不禁想起前年第二次来时我们一个军长告诉我的话：
    “北朝鲜这样一个一千二百万人口的国家，遇到的又是这样一个残暴的敌人，但是他们从来没有气馁过，一个倒下去，另一个又站起来，而且还尽一切力量支援我们。同志，这个国家，这个军队是够坚强的。作他们的战友，也是最光荣的。”
    所以我感到我们国家在继苏联之后和他们签定经济及文化合作协定，无偿的援助他们人民币八万亿元，是非常适时和适宜的。
    我也感到我们志愿军那样奋不顾身的为朝鲜人民牺牲，不是没有道理的，在他们内心的深处蕴藏着高贵的国际主义的种子，像孙占元，两条腿都被炮弹打断，还爬行了三百多公尺，还掩护了易才学打了四个火力点，而最后和敌人同归于尽，躺在他身边的美国鬼子就是六个。黄继光不消说了，金城反击战役中李家发的英勇事迹是跟黄继光一样的，用自己的胸膛猛扑到敌人的机枪射口上，挡住了敌人疯狂射出来的子弹，牺牲以后，双手仍紧紧抓住碉堡口的泥土，半睁着眼睛注视着轿岩山主峰上的巨石。去年夏季战役，我军攻占北汉江东岸“大无名山”时，先头部队被一道铁丝网阻挠住了，突击排长命两个爆炸手去爆破，不幸中途都负伤了，部队一时被敌人的炮火压在铁丝网附近不能前进。排长急坏了，如果不很快冲上去，就会失掉战机，敌人也会跑掉，后续部队这时正一个劲的在往上涌，部队集结在那里，一定会增加伤亡。正在千钧一发之际，火箭筒班班长李云峰同志跑上来，他来不及请示排长，几步跨上去，扑倒在铁丝网上，高喊道：“同志们！为了胜利，从我身上通过吧！”“同志们，冲上去就是胜利，为了胜利，快从我身上通过吧！”最后他全身是伤，战友们都劝他不要再扑到铁丝网上，他坚决拒绝，并且还说：“同志们，快过吧，时间要紧，胜利要紧！”等到他伤太重实在不行了而被抢救到一个掩蔽部时，他醒来第一句问的话就是：“快去观察一下，咱们部队冲上去了没有？”
    这样的战士在志愿军中是千千万万的，他们的大小功臣有三十多万。
    而将军们，指挥员们，更是了不得，朝鲜战争，那一个胜利，离得开他们！从高级指挥员起，一直到一个排长，进攻一个阵地，指挥员都要去前沿亲自布置，三番五次的研究，反复上下的进行教育，一直到一个班长都觉得有把握了才动手。而步炮、坦克各方面的协同，真是做到了步行机一叫，炮弹就飞去了，火箭炮如战士所说的像流水一样刷的一声就过去了。
    坦克是新兵种，但他们也创造了新的奇迹。打轿岩山我们一辆坦克陷在泥里了，不能开动，而且很暴露。然而战斗非用它不可。指挥员要他们隐蔽待命，他们把它隐蔽好了，指挥员一声令下，他们的炮打出去，弹无虚发，消灭了三个敌人以坦克作成的火力点。但是他们是暴露的，他们还停留在路上，敌人一定会报复，怎么办呢？他们发挥了智慧，开始加大油门，让声音震澈山谷，然后慢慢放小，就好像坦克已经开走了似的，声音逐渐听不见了，而敌人准备打这个坦克的炮火却向听不太见的声音打去。
    这样坦克还是安全的停着，不久就从泥泞中开了出去。
    这里并没有什么了不得的人在指挥，这是战士们的勇敢和机智。而这，在志愿军中已经成了风气。
    我们的指挥员都善于运用和提高这些勇敢和机智，所以他们非常相信他们的战士们。
      “还苦吧”，同志们一定会问这个问题。我已经是第三次到朝鲜了，我特地到一个连队住了一夜，他们走出了坑道，过去阳光不足，空气不足的状况完全改变了，他们在把荒山变成乐园，修房子，修操场，种菜，就是说他们现在走出门来已经有了站脚和运动的地方。他们尽量在改善他们的生活，有时也开个周末家乡戏的晚会。战士们是满足的，不以为苦，有的战士还说：“必须珍贵战斗时期的生活。”所以他们还经常练习夜间爬山，打背包，有的战士自己挖了个地堡，半夜深更去摸，缘因就是他们知道他们的神圣任务是“警惕地监视敌人”，而敌人隔他们并不远，四公里——八华里，所谓军事分界线不过如此而已；近代战争，这是不算远的，随便一种武器都可以打过来；更何况敌人成天照样在修工事，在实弹演习，校正机，也是战士们叫的“老病号”还天天在飞着侦察哩！有的地方要用望远镜才看得见敌人的活动，有的地方则不要望远镜，肉眼就行。
    如果再看看板门店，敌人耍的那套无耻把戏，特别是他们对俘虏的残暴行为，我们同志怎么能放松警惕呢？战士们是很警惕的，因为他们深深懂得：“和平是要用自己手中的枪杆子来保卫的。”
    记得人民军阵地欢迎我们的标语就是：
    “中国同志们，我们的任务第一个是警惕，第二个是警惕，第三个还是警惕！”
    东海岸我们参观的人民军一个炮兵阵地，炮手们的动作是很迅速的，他们随时可以回击敌人。
    我们在临津江、五圣山、轿岩山所看到的我们的战士，尤其同他们的指挥员接谈，我们很放心，我们也不怕美李匪帮重新再挑起战火。
    战士们很懂得，将军们尤其懂得。
    “守卫朝鲜，就是守卫祖国！”
    “保卫朝鲜，就是保卫祖国！”
    “五圣山的路不仅是通北京，五圣山上人们的心也是和北京紧联着的。”
    而祖国现在正在进行社会主义工业化的建设，北京就正在指挥着这个建设，华尔街那群凶犯们则不愿意我们这个建设。这就是人民军战士所以要再三警惕，我们志愿军战士和将军们要坚决守卫朝鲜、保卫祖国的道理。
    祖国使得我们志愿军这样奋不顾身，志愿军一想起祖国浑身就是力量，没有一点不想到祖国，没有一点不感激祖国，秋风一起，想起祖国；棉衣到了，感激祖国；家信到了，想起祖国；增加了津贴，寄钱回家，感激祖国；更不必谈祖国捐献的飞机大炮，使他们的仗比从前好打多了。
    战士称祖国为他们的母亲是很有道理的，他们心中的祖国就是——毛主席、天安门、鞍钢、老婆、孩子。他们就是为这些在打仗的。
    是不是仅限于此呢？并不仅限于此！朝鲜，就是我上面所说到的朝鲜，和祖国一样，同样鼓舞着他们战斗。
    当朴在根烈士牺牲的消息传到上甘岭时，一个团指挥所的指挥员顿时狠狠地在罐头箱做成的桌子上打了一拳：
    “为朝鲜人，勇敢的战斗吧，一直到我停止呼吸”。
    我们这次碰见参加上甘岭战役的志愿军某部首长崔建功，他还念念不忘朴在根，就是见我们的那天，他还特地去他家看了一次。
    时至今日，朝鲜停战了，白天行军，白天上阵地，有时间也有机会允许我们来和朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军、我们的志愿军详细的叙谈，我们怎么能说中朝可分呢？又怎么能说谁帮助了谁呢？又怎么能说那个该感谢那个呢？
    我们的命运是一个，我们的任务是一个，我们的牺牲也是一个，我们的胜利更是一个。
    这就是朝鲜一个空军师长讲的“特殊的友谊”，也是金首相秘书何仰天讲的“友谊，一家人一样”，更是淮阳郡素丰里金千熔老乡讲的：“宁愿鸭绿江水尽，我心不忘中朝谊”。
    正是这种特殊的友谊，像一家人一样的友谊，宁愿鸭绿江水尽，也不愿忘去的友谊，使我们能够把战争中最艰难的日子渡过去，把敌人打得他不得不在停战协定上签字。
    我们美好的日子是因为朝鲜人民，人民军和我们的志愿军抵抗住了美帝国主义才安稳过起来的，社会主义工业化也是依靠着这个大动力才有了可靠的保证。
    这里我们就不难想到，为什么我们有个部队六十三个战士认一个朝鲜老太太做妈妈，而老太太见到我们代表时，还说将来要到中国看他的孩子。
    为什么昌道郡任南里四个民主青年同盟盟员崔龙珠、宋仲根、赵家考、徐石范，里领导人因他们年纪小不批准他们抬担架，而他们却组织一个担架组在炮火中往返抬了六次伤员，当志愿军的朝鲜联络员劝他们：“你们年纪小，到封锁区有危险！”他们还是不听，还说：“前边志愿军与敌人决死战，我们在后方还不能抬担架吗？别看我们年纪小，如果政府批准，我们马上参加人民军去。”劝他们吃饭，他们也不吃。这情景深深感动了一个重伤员，他说：“连朝鲜的小弟弟都支援我们，我们能不胜利吗？”
    为什么在乌川里这个村庄，敌人毁得只剩下两户，而我们志愿军在七个月中就把这个村庄重建起来，由两户增加到六十二户，九百余口人。
    至于修房子、修学校、修理办公室——甚至于修电影院，我们是主动的，朝鲜同志也是很热情的，我们所到之处，凡有志愿军住的地方都修了。
    这是为什么？因为他们都懂得停战以后，祖国人民交给他们的任务就是：要为朝鲜人民重建家园。
    在平壤，我们的工兵团一开到，他们不仅就接受了重建平壤的任务，而且还编了个歌子全团唱：
    牡丹峰上搭起了钢铁的高架，
    大同江里架设着雄伟的桥梁；
    运输的车辆日夜奔忙，
    工作的人们情绪高涨；
    平壤城到处都是愉快的建设气象，
    志愿军工兵来到平壤，
    和朝鲜人民一起医治战争的创伤。
    炸毁的楼房重修起，
    破坏的道路铺宽敞，
    填平炸弹坑，修起工厂，
    铲掉破砖瓦，盖好民房，
    为朝鲜人民献出巨大的力量，
    让受难的人民早得到幸福的时光。
    战争中我们并肩上战场，
    建设里我们汗水一块淌；
    友谊的鲜花开放，
    我们的团结无比坚强，
    金日成元帅领导我们，
    平壤要比战前更漂亮。
    我们建设英雄的平壤，
    要像建设北京一样，
    我们建设英雄的平壤，
    要像建设北京一样。
    战士和干部是抱着这个心情来建设的，所以大同江便桥提前七天完成了，而当要举行通车剪彩时，因木料未赶得及还有六十公尺桥面没有铺板，战士们拆了他们自己的房子。
    我这次亲眼看到我们战士为战争、为朝鲜人民那样强度的劳动，而且是极愉快的劳动，战士们说：没有不会的事情，除了生孩子。你看，木匠、铁匠、泥水匠、砖瓦匠，打坑道超过了国内任何钻探的矿工，所以曲耀离也说：“看了志愿军的忘我劳动，感到自己的劳动热情还没有完全发挥，决心要向志愿军学习，回国去一定要争取棉花每亩产量提高到一千一百斤。”
    朝鲜人民恢复建设的精神，也跟志愿军打仗劳动一样。我们看到平壤的恢复，真是隔一天一变，尽管是一般的房子，然而已经是数不清了；晚上灯光已经不是星星点点，一片黑暗的日子已成为过去，最漂亮的“巴士”车在马路上行驶，瓦砾已经全部被打扫干净，炼钢厂在恢复。一个把一部机器埋在地下，一部机器搬到满浦，一部机器被毁坏的炼铁炉已经凑到一起重新开工，每次已可出铁十五吨；纺纱厂一个月中由六千纱锭增到一万三千。七天修理好两层楼的宿舍招待我们一千一百人，这种成绩真是惊人！
    他们是怎么样劳动的？举一个电影厂的恢复为例吧：二十五间房子，上级没有给一点料，也没有工具，也没有技术人员，一切全靠自力更生。从厂长以下全体动员，男的盖二十间，女的盖五间，到废墟中去找钢筋，找砖瓦，找木料，找洋钉，规定半月一人检七百根，有一个同志三次就检了三千根；没有工具，全靠两手，搬石头是两手，泥墙壁是两手；最后没有盖屋顶的瓦，全体到离平壤一百公里外的地方去找薄石头，一块块的开出，又一块块地运回平壤，等我们从前线返回平壤时，他们已经搬进去办公了。
    而这些人是并不懂得建筑的艺术家呀！
    人民，一个叫罗爱兰的妇女，丈夫被打死了，剩一个孩子，她又病，但还是自己盖了两间房子，中间她曾重病了七天，因为房子还没有盖顶，她就在没顶的房子里住了七天，病好后再盖。我们记者去访问她时，她已经很舒适的陈设起来了，还放了她从前的剧照。
    炼钢厂的工人朴甲东，从来就没有离开过他的厂，敌人炸时，他搬到厂后的一个小山沟筑了个洞住着，天天看到炸，但他天天进去搬东西，边走边说：“看你狗东西炸吧！将来老子要建个比这个更好的，气死你！”一停战，建厂缺耐火砖，他到原厂的耐火砖灰烬处去找耐火砖的碎砖，压成粉，最后又制成砖，加速了恢复。
    兵士们，板门店回来的战俘，都投入了建设。走遍平壤，看不见一个闲人，特别是妇女，那里有建设，那里就有她们；不仅在战场上可以看见女高射炮手、女坦克驾驶员、女航空员，在建设工地，在炼钢厂里，在交通岗上都可以见到妇女；而在农村，据朝鲜同志说，朝鲜妇女从前是不会扶犁杖的，现在也会了。相当于中国县委级的干部，也出现了好些女同志。就是她们战时领导人民支援战争，战后正在领导互助合作。平壤附近一个叫文华里的村，七十七个劳动力（其中五十九个妇女，十八个男的）组成一个互助组，她们说：“与其帮他们干，勿宁组织在一起。”政府为了推动这个运动，仅在江原道即发下去耕牛四千余条。
    看到这些，我们只有肃然起敬！我们现时的建设条件，比朝鲜不知好多少倍，我们还有什么不能建设的！
    再加上有苏联、有中国，有整个和平阵营的援助，朝鲜同志自己说的：“我们胜利有保证，我们恢复也有保证。”所以他们一点不担心，他们既不怕恢复不了，也不怕美帝国主义再挑起战争，他们都有一个统一的意志，正如金首相常告诉他们的：
    “炸！我们还要修得更好！”
    他们自己也常说：人的力量是无穷的，没有克服不了的困难。
    我们都非常相信他们这个毅力。
    志愿军也相信，所以他们打仗在一起，建设也在一起，明年志愿军还打算在驻地包干帮助他们春耕。这一来，朝鲜人民战后起码的恢复可以得到保障，而这正是恢复朝鲜的根本——大战之后，使人民有一个喘息的机会。
    志愿军——我们祖国最优秀的儿女，打了三年仗，他们自己是很安慰的，他们说：“三年的仗没有白打，保卫了朝鲜的独立，也保卫了祖国的建设”，这就是他们心中胜利的真正意义。
    所以他们对他们停战后继续留在朝鲜等待朝鲜问题的完全解决没有什么意见，他们对祖国的希望是两句话：
    “大门外的事由我们来包干，
      祖国人民放心实行总路线。”
    而对我们伟大的领袖毛主席就是希望他永远健康，不要生一点病。
    这也是每个朝鲜人民的心情，他们经常说：中国建设的胜利，就是朝鲜人民建设的胜利。对于毛主席，他们是和对金日成元帅一样关心的，谈到金日成元帅，必谈到毛主席，好些人都在读毛主席的著作。
    美帝国主义，李承晚匪帮，恐怕只有永远瞪着眼看我们胜利，看我们建设，看他们自己的最后失败吧！
