Farmers in the Yellow River flood area of Henan Province enthusiastically respond to the national call to sell grain.

After the wheat harvest last year, the Ling Heine and Gao Yumei agricultural production cooperatives in Nanling Township, Xihua County, Henan Province, had already sold more than 100 shi of wheat to the state. After studying the general line, they sold all their remaining grain of more than 180 shi to the state. When the township held a patriotic grain sales conference, more than 10,000 farmers from various places came to participate. Department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives sent goods, and banks also brought cash. The grain-selling farmers deposited the money in the bank on the spot and bought back production and living materials to prepare for expanded reproduction. After the meeting, more than 100 carts from the whole township, led by the mule-drawn carts of the Ling Heine agricultural production cooperative decorated with flowers and bells, transported the first batch of 136,000 jin of grain sold to the state to the county town. The farmers participating in the meeting were in high spirits and expressed their determination to go back and enthusiastically sell grain and produce well. Li Dahei, the secretary of the Party branch of Xuan Yuan Township, District 3, Fugou County, and three other agricultural production cooperatives have also led the whole township to sell more than 200,000 jin of surplus grain. After they beat drums and gongs to send the grain into the warehouse, they also bought back most of the money for production materials and deposited it in the bank.

Since 1938, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits breached the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou, the ten years of Yellow River floods caused them profound disasters. After liberation in 1947, when the farmers returned to their homes, the surrounding hundreds of miles were full of weeds. The People's Government has vigorously supported them in rebuilding their homes in all aspects. In the past six years, Xihua County alone (which accounts for about two-fifths of the Yellow River flood area in Henan Province) has issued loans of 11.238 billion yuan to farmers, lent 1.7 million jin of grain, and provided 3,456,636 jin of relief grain; helped farmers buy back livestock and farm tools, and organized them to reclaim wasteland for production. The government also implemented a production incentive policy of not levying taxes on reclaimed land for three years. After only five or six years, the Yellow River flood area is now a cluster of new villages and a fertile wheat field. The Yellow River flood area has become a rich granary.

From the collective reclamation and joint cultivation, the farmers in the Yellow River flood area personally experienced the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation. Therefore, mutual aid and cooperative organizations have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. The Ling Heine cooperative in Xihua County was gradually established by more than 40 of the poorest farmers who returned from fleeing the famine from collective reclamation and production. In 1951, the entire cooperative harvested a total of 120,000 jin of grain, and each household provided mutual assistance and relief, initially escaping famine. With the consolidation and development of the cooperative, the government also lent waterwheels, new-style plows, and fertilizers. In the 1952 wheat season, the entire cooperative harvested 96,000 jin of wheat, 20 jin more per mu than the mutual aid groups and individual households in the whole village; the autumn yield was even four times higher than that of the mutual aid groups and individual households. In the same year, the entire cooperative sold 25,800 jin of grain to the state in addition to repaying state loans. Although the wheat suffered frost damage in 1953, it still increased by more than 10% compared to 1952. Last autumn, the Ling Heine and Gao Yumei agricultural production cooperatives began to use tractors from the state tractor station for plowing and sowing wheat, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor (the township has an average of more than eight mu of land per person). From the practical experience of the benefits given by the state and the benefits of being organized, the farmers in the Yellow River flood area have deepened their love for industrialization and their yearning for socialism. Therefore, the two cooperatives sold more than 280 shi of surplus grain to the state and are determined to support the construction of socialist industrialization with practical actions to expand reproduction.

    河南省黄泛区农民响应国家号召踊跃卖粮
    河南省黄泛区西华县南凌乡凌黑妮、高玉梅两个农业生产合作社去年麦收后，已卖给国家小麦一百余石，学习总路线后，又把一百八十石余粮全部卖给国家。该乡举行爱国售粮大会时，各地有万余农民赶来参加，百货公司、供销合作社送来货物；银行也带来现款，卖粮农民当场就把钱存入银行和买回生产、生活资料，准备扩大再生产。会后全乡一百多辆大车，以凌黑妮农业生产合作社插花挂铃的骡马大车为前导，浩浩荡荡把卖给国家的第一批粮食共十三万六千斤送到县城，参加大会的农民情绪高昂，都表示要回去踊跃卖粮，好好生产。扶沟县三区玄元乡党支部书记李大黑等三个农业生产合作社也已带动全乡卖余粮二十多万斤，他们敲鼓鸣锣送粮入仓后，也把大部款子买回生产资料和存入银行。
    黄泛区农民自从一九三八年蒋匪扒了花园口黄河堤，十年黄水给他们造成深重的灾难。一九四七年解放后，农民重返家园时，周围数百里尽是荒草。人民政府从各方面大力扶助他们重建家园。六年来，仅西华县（约占河南境内黄泛区五分之二左右）就给农民发放贷款一百一十二亿三千八百万元，贷粮一百七十万斤，救济粮三百四十五万六千六百三十六斤；帮助农民买回牲口、农具，组织起来开荒生产。政府又实行了开荒地三年不负担的奖励生产政策，经过短短的五、六年，如今黄泛区已是一簇簇新兴的村庄，和一块连一块的肥美的麦田，黄泛区已经变成丰饶的米粮川了。
    黄泛区农民从集体开荒，合伙耕种的过程中，亲身体验到互助合作的优越性，因此互助合作组织，像雨后春笋似地发展起来。西华县凌黑妮的合作社就是四十多户逃难回来的最贫困的农民从集体开荒生产中逐步成立起来的。一九五一年全社共收了十二万斤粮食，各户互助互济，初步摆脱了饥荒。随着合作社的巩固和发展，政府又贷给了水车、新式步犁和肥料等。一九五二年麦季全社收了九万六千斤小麦，每亩比全村互助组和单干户多收二十斤；秋季产量更比互助组和单干户高出四倍。当年全社除归还国家贷款外，还卖给国家二万五千八百斤粮食。一九五三年小麦虽然遭受霜灾，仍比一九五二年增产一成多。去年秋季，凌黑妮、高玉梅两个农业生产合作社又开始由国家的拖拉机站用拖拉机代耕，播种小麦，解决了他们劳动力不足（该乡每人平均八亩多地）的困难。黄泛区农民从国家所给的好处和组织起来的好处的实际体验中，加深了对工业化的热爱和对社会主义的向往，因此这两个社把二百八十余石余粮卖给了国家，并决心以扩大再生产的实际行动支援社会主义工业化的建设。（吕建中）
