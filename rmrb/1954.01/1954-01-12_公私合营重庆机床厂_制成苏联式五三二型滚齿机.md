    Joint State-Private Chongqing Machine Tool Factory
    Produces Soviet-Style 532 Gear Hobbing Machine
    China's first Soviet-style 532 gear hobbing machine has been successfully trial-produced at the joint state-private Chongqing Machine Tool Factory. In early December of last year, after assessment by personnel dispatched by the Second Machinery Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government, the quality of the lathe was found to be good and its precision met Soviet blueprint standards. The factory has now begun small-batch production.
    The Soviet-style 532 gear hobbing machine is a precision machine tool for manufacturing gears. Gears are the main parts of various machines. The 532 gear hobbing machine, manufactured according to Soviet blueprint standards, has a complex structure and excellent performance. The entire machine has 796 kinds of parts, totaling 1,848 pieces, and 1,053 kinds of tools are used just to manufacture the machine. Using this machine to process gears results in high precision, and the output is three to four times higher than processing with a universal milling machine. It also has complete electrical control equipment, making operation extremely easy and safe, which can reduce non-productive time and labor intensity. It is estimated that one person can operate two or three machines.
    The successful trial production of this Soviet-style 532 gear hobbing machine has prepared the conditions for China's future machine manufacturing industry to process precision gears.

    公私合营重庆机床厂
    制成苏联式五三二型滚齿机
    我国第一台苏联式五三二型滚齿机已在公私合营重庆机床厂试制成功。去年十二月上旬，经中央人民政府第一机械工业部第二机械工业管理局派人鉴定，车床质量良好，精度合乎苏联图纸标准。现该厂已开始进行小批生产。
    苏联式五三二型滚齿机是制造齿轮的精密工作母机。齿轮是各种机器的主要零件。按照苏联图纸标准制造出来的五三二型滚齿机构造复杂，性能极为良好。全部机器零件共有七百九十六种，一千八百四十八件，仅用来制造机器的工具就有一千零五十三种。用这种机器加工齿轮，精密度高，产量也要比用万能铣床加工高三四倍。并有完善的电气控制设备，操作极为轻便，而且安全，可以减少非生产时间和劳动强度。据估计一人可操作两三台。
    这种苏联式五三二型滚齿机的试制成功，为我国今后机器制造工业加工精密齿轮准备了条件。
