Review of the Film "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy"

    Original Work: Wang Zongyuan, Ren Ping; Adapted by: Guo Wei, Ji Ye, Dongfang; Director: Guo Wei
    Produced by: Beijing Film Studio, Central Film Bureau

The film "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" was produced by the Beijing Film Studio in 1953 and is also a very good feature film produced by New China's film industry in 1953. Since its release in major cities across the country, it has received positive feedback from audiences everywhere, and this is not accidental.

First of all, although the scope of reality encompassed by the film's content is not particularly broad, and the scale of production is not particularly large, it reflects a fundamental characteristic of the Chinese People's Liberation Army within the scope required by its theme, namely, the excellent qualities of being resourceful, brave, tenacious, and indomitable in overcoming any difficulties to eliminate the enemy, and the good practice of closely relying on the masses. In the long course of our country's revolutionary struggle, thanks to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and strong political education, millions of People's Liberation Army soldiers have become highly conscious people's fighters, fully utilizing their wisdom and talents. Therefore, they have been able to rapidly grow from small to large and become strong in the constant struggle with the enemy, and finally eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's reactionary armed forces on the Chinese mainland, liberating the entire mainland. Although "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" reflects only a small episode in our great revolutionary war, it specifically shows us the invincible essence of the People's Liberation Army and the inevitable demise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. When the bandit army brigade commander Fang Ziqiao, depicted in the film, fled to the Thousand-Foot Cliff on Mount Hua and boasted loudly, how could he have imagined that although Mount Hua was a natural barrier, there were no insurmountable obstacles in the face of the People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party? The truth is this: Just as the bandits were complacently dreaming of a "comeback," our reconnaissance heroes had already climbed the "Tianjing" (Heavenly Well) on the cliffs, crossed the abyss, and tightly grasped their throats.

The reconnaissance heroes' high level of wisdom and heroic actions not only excite and encourage the audience but also increase their unparalleled confidence in the country's construction efforts. People can understand from these heroes why the volunteer troops sent by the motherland to aid the Korean people were able to defeat the world's most ferocious U.S. imperialism and its accomplices despite the extremely difficult conditions of initial material supply and geographical environment. The film also tells us that the reason why the reconnaissance heroes were able to climb Mount Hua was not by relying on anyone's brilliant strategy but by using all kinds of methods to consult the masses from all sides and relying on the wisdom of the masses. Without the support of the masses, it would be impossible to find a second route to Mount Hua; even if found, it would be full of difficulties to successfully ascend the mountain. The film vividly depicts the pure and kind character of the Chang Shenglin mother and son, and the flesh-and-blood relationship between the revolutionary army and the people, and the practice of relying on the masses and cherishing the people, which further supplements the source of the excellent qualities of the People's Army, thereby giving it a more profound educational significance.

Secondly, the single theme, concentrated story, and tense plot are the second characteristics of the film's success. The theme of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is to demonstrate the resourcefulness, bravery, and invincible spirit of the people's fighters in the process of finding a second route in the face of the legend that "Mount Hua has only one road since ancient times." The idea expressed by the author here through the simple description of the specific actions of seven reconnaissance soldiers is much more powerful than some films that attempt to summarize or explain a certain strategic idea with abstract concepts.

From the perspective of the story, it is also relatively concentrated and compact, without any loose or protracted phenomena. The seven reconnaissance soldiers start from accepting the task, conducting reconnaissance, visiting, rescuing the masses, and then climbing the mountain, crossing the bridge, until the surprise attack, combat, and finally winning the victory. The development clues from beginning to end make people clear at a glance without feeling dry. Especially in terms of plot, the terrain of the cliffs and cliffs of Mount Hua seen by the reconnaissance staff officer for the first time in the telescope aroused a sense of suspense in the audience's hearts, worrying about the dangerous terrain encountered by the reconnaissance soldiers. Afterwards, it was finally possible to find nearby residents, but the residents were suspicious of the reconnaissance soldiers. When the masses were persuaded and Chang Shenglin led the way, the road Chang Shenglin took was not an ordinary road - "Tianjing." Starting from climbing the "Tianjing," the first natural danger, the audience's emotions were further captured, making people pay close attention to the actions of the heroes. When we were just about to breathe a sigh of relief for the heroes climbing the "Tianjing," the second natural danger - "Tiger's Mouth" - appeared in front of us. In the middle of crossing the Tiger's Mouth, reconnaissance soldier Wang Shengqi finally lost his grip and rolled down due to excessive tension, which was really a matter of life and death, and couldn't help but make people exclaim. Due to the hero's strong will, Wang Shengqi, who had lost his grip and rolled down, was finally pulled up by the rope lowered by his comrades. But the following "Sky Bridge" was even more dangerous. When reconnaissance soldier Lu Deliang used a bamboo pole to forcefully prop up the withered wooden bridge and the wooden bridge snapped and fell into the abyss, the audience felt even more terrified. Due to the breaking of the wooden bridge, the next heroic action was introduced - the reconnaissance soldiers tied the rope to the pine roots in the stone wall crevices on the opposite side, and one by one grabbed the rope and swung over. Later, capturing sentries, entering enemy camps, fighting wits and courage, attacking east and west, until capturing the bandit chief Fang Ziqiao on the top of the West Peak, each step was tighter than the last, making people feel anxious and hardly giving people a chance to breathe.

The film demonstrates the noble qualities of the reconnaissance heroes through these thrilling and tense plots.

Thirdly, following the tense plot of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," the issue of the thriller style should be discussed.

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" should be said to be a thriller film. However, whenever thriller films are mentioned, it is easy to associate them with American detective films or old Chinese martial arts films. In fact, the thriller films we are talking about are essentially different from American detective films that are bizarre, deliberately mysterious, full of mystery, ghosts, murders, and adultery, and that are used to corrupt and plunder, numb the people, and harm the youth for the benefit of the reactionary class, and that in the past, Chinese martial arts films were also a kind of thing that promoted feudal superstition. The thriller films we advocate are based on specific themes in real life (such as the lives of guerrillas in the sharp struggle during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, the struggle life of reconnaissance personnel or public security personnel to defend the motherland, the tense life of survey teams or explorers who go deep into the mountains or remote islands to conduct arduous struggles, etc.), creating films that can inspire people's patriotism, cultivate people's resourcefulness, bravery, love of labor, and adventurous spirit, and are rich in noble ideology and artistry.

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is the first thriller film in New China's film art. The author's basis is not fictional, but real-life material, true stories of real people in the Liberation War of the Great Northwest (these heroic deeds that ordinary people cannot imagine are countless among our great People's Liberation Army). Based on this real theme, the author selected various plots with thrilling nature, placed them in a specific environment for artistic processing, thus completing the thriller film that we now see and love. Many of its plots are thrilling, but they are also real, and therefore artistically convincing. For example, after the reconnaissance soldiers finally reached the North Peak of Mount Hua after thousands of dangers, their reconnaissance mission to find a second route has been completed. As long as they report back to their superiors, they can dispatch the combat troops down the mountain to eliminate the enemy. However, when they crossed the Sky Bridge, not only was the wooden bridge broken, but even the only pine root they relied on to cross was broken. There was absolutely no possibility of returning that night, and if they took a detour down the mountain from another route, it would delay the entire unit's offensive deployment. This created an opportunity for our heroes to display a high degree of patriotism and express their resourcefulness and bravery. If the reconnaissance soldiers did not adapt to the situation and did not fight the enemy with an active offensive spirit to find a way out under such urgent circumstances, it would inevitably lead to huge mistakes. Chairman Mao taught us that when a tiger suddenly appears in front of us, the best way is to resolutely kill it. Our reconnaissance heroes took this approach and achieved victory. This method of placing the protagonist in an unexpected but credible and rapidly changing situation to show their alertness, quick judgment, and resolute and decisive action is the basic method of creating thriller films.

In addition, the director's depiction of the natural scenery of Mount Hua also added a lot of strength to the film. The magnificent and splendid natural scenery of the motherland, with white clouds like ribbons, is not only very beautiful in the composition of the picture but, more importantly, it is well integrated with the ideological content of the film, which was not paid enough attention to in some of our past films. Let us imagine that if the theme of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" was not expressed in the real background of Mount Hua, the effect would be different. Precisely because such an extraordinary heroic action takes place in such a magnificent and dangerous background, the audience pays double attention to every action of the heroes, and feels particularly lovable and respectable for their heroic behavior. Conversely, the audience feels even more resentful that such a beautiful place is still occupied and trampled on by the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang who harms the country and the people. Therefore, our films should fully express the beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland, such as the beautiful natural scenery, combined with the ideological content of the film, on the screen to meet the requirements of the broad audience and cultivate the people's, especially the youth's, love for the motherland. This is also a problem that must be paid attention to in creating the national form of our film art.

Of course, this does not mean that "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is a perfect film. It still has some shortcomings. The main shortcoming is the lack of character description in terms of the characters' image. It is difficult to distinguish what different independent personalities and different mental states they have among the seven reconnaissance soldiers who appear in front of the audience. The seven reconnaissance soldiers are almost of the same personality and attitude, which cannot but reduce its impression in the audience's minds, and thus also reduces the appeal of the entire film to a certain extent. If the character of Staff Officer Liu can be described more prominently, so that people can see his unique personality characteristics, then the influence of Staff Officer Liu's indelible heroic image will increase the value of the entire film by one level. If the seven reconnaissance soldiers each have their own personality characteristics, and each have their own expression forms in dealing with various situations and various things, the development of the entire plot will add more brilliance, and therefore its artistic image will be more convincing. This is one aspect. In addition, there are still more or less shortcomings in terms of combat deployment, combat actions, the explanation of individual plots, and language, etc., which need to be worked hard by screenwriters, directors, and actors in the next creation.

On the whole, "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is a film welcomed by the broad audience; it is a work with high ideological and artistic qualities. From the perspective of the thriller style, it is a good start for our thriller films.

    评影片“智取华山”
    袁文殊
    原作：王宗元、任萍改编：郭维、纪叶、东方导演：郭维
    中央电影局北京电影制片厂出品
    影片“智取华山”是北京电影制片厂一九五三年的出品，也是新中国电影在一九五三年内所摄制的很好的一部故事片。它自在全国各大城市上映以来，即得到各地观众的良好反映，这并不是偶然的。
    首先，影片内容所概括的现实范围虽然不是如何广阔，摄制规模也不是如何巨大，但它却在它的主题思想所要求的范围之内，反映了中国人民解放军的一个基本特点，即机智、勇敢、坚韧、顽强，克服任何困难以消灭敌人的优秀品质和紧紧地依靠群众的良好作风。在我国长期的革命斗争过程中，由于中国共产党的领导，由于坚强的政治教育，使得数百万人民解放军人人都成为具有高度自觉性的人民战士，充分发挥了智慧和才能，因此才能够在和敌人的不断斗争中迅速地从小到大，茁壮坚强，最后消灭了蒋介石匪帮在中国大陆上的反动武装，解放了全国大陆。“智取华山”所反映的虽然只是我们伟大革命战争中的一个小小的插曲，但它却具体地给我们显示出人民解放军的无敌的本质和蒋介石匪帮必然灭亡的真理。当影片中所描写的匪军旅长方子乔逃上华山千尺幢大吹大擂的时候，他何尝想到华山固然是个天险，但是在共产党领导下的人民解放军面前是没有不能克服的天险的呢？事实正是这样：正当匪徒们洋洋得意地梦想着“卷土重来”的时候，我们的侦察英雄已经攀上悬崖绝壁的“天井”，跨过万丈深渊，紧紧地扼住他们的咽喉了。
    侦察英雄们的高度的智慧和神勇的行动，不但给观众以兴奋和鼓舞，而且增加了他们对祖国建设事业的无比信心。人们从这些英雄们的身上就可以了解到那些被祖国派去援助朝鲜人民的志愿部队的勇士们，为什么能够在初期的物资供应和地理环境都极端困难的条件之下，仍然能够把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义和它的帮凶们一齐打败的道理了。影片也告诉我们：侦察英雄们之所以能够登上华山，并不是依靠什么人的神机妙算，而是用尽种种方法从各方面去请教群众，依靠群众的智慧而达到的。如果没有群众的支持，要找到上华山的第二条路，是不可能的；找到了，要成功地上山，也是困难重重的。影片生动地描写了常生林母子俩的纯朴、善良的性格，描写了革命军队与人民群众之间的血肉关系和依靠群众、刻己爱民作风，这就更补充说明了人民军队的优秀品质的来源，从而赋以更深刻的教育意义。
    其次，主题单一、故事集中和情节紧张是影片获得成功的第二个特征。“智取华山”的主题是在“华山自古一条路”的传说面前找出第二条道路的过程中来表现人民战士的机智、勇敢和无坚不克的精神。作者在这里朴素地通过七个侦察员的具体行动的描写所表现的思想，要比某些企图以抽象的概念去概括或说明某种战略思想的影片要有力得多。
    从故事方面来看，也比较集中和紧凑，没有松散和拖沓的现象。七个侦察员从接受任务出发，进行侦察、访问，解救群众，而至登山、过桥，直到奇袭、战斗，最后获得胜利，自始至终的发展线索，使人一目了然而又不嫌枯燥。特别在情节方面，从侦察参谋第一次在望远镜中所看见的华山的悬崖峭壁的地形，就在观众的心里引起一种悬念：为侦察员们所碰到的这种险峻地势而着急。之后，好容易找到了附近的居民，而居民又对侦察员们发生疑惧。及至说服了群众，获得常生林带路之后，常生林所带到的又不是一条平常的路——“天井”，从爬“天井”这第一个天险起，就更进一步地抓住了观众的感情，使人十分留意地注视着英雄们的行动。当我们刚要为英雄们爬上“天井”而舒出一口气的时候，第二个天险——“老虎嘴”又出现在眼前了。在过老虎嘴中间由于侦察员王生齐过分紧张，终于失手滚了下去的时候，真是性命攸关，不由得不令人失声喊叫起来。由于英雄的坚强意志，失手滚下去的王生齐终于被同志们放下去的绳子拉上来了。但是接着而来的“天桥”却更加险要，当侦察员路德亮拿竹竿向那枯朽的木桥用力一撑而木桥就咔嚓折断掉落万丈深渊的时候，观众更感到毛骨悚然。由于木桥的折断，又引出了下一个英雄行动——侦察员把绳子拴在对面石壁缝里的松树根上，一个一个抓住绳子荡了过去。更后，捉岗哨，进敌营，斗智斗勇，东打西杀，一直到西峰顶上抓住匪酋方子乔为止，一步迫紧一步，提心吊胆，简直叫人没有喘息的机会。
    影片正是通过这些惊心动魄的紧张情节，表现了侦察英雄们的崇高的品质。
    再次，紧接着“智取华山”的紧张情节所要谈的便是关于惊险样式的问题。
    “智取华山”应该说是一种惊险片。但是一提到惊险片，总容易使人联想到美国的侦探片或旧中国的武侠片之类。其实我们所说的惊险片和美国那种离奇怪诞、故弄玄虚、充满神秘、鬼怪、凶杀、奸淫的侦探片和中国过去那种飞檐走壁、神奇变幻的武侠片是有本质上的区别的。美国的侦探片是借着虚假的惊险动作，故意布置一些曲折离奇的情节来进行诲淫诲盗，麻醉人民和戕害青年以利反动阶级的统治的，过去中国的武侠片也是一种宣扬封建迷信的东西。而我们所提倡的惊险片，却是根据现实生活中的特定题材（如抗日战争解放战争中在尖锐斗争中的游击队的生活，侦察员或公安人员保卫祖国的斗争生活，勘察队员或探险队员深入大山或荒岛进行艰苦奋斗的紧张生活等等），创造出能启发人民的爱国主义思想，培养人民的机智、勇敢、热爱劳动和冒险精神的富有高尚的思想性与艺术性的影片。
    “智取华山”是我们新中国电影艺术中的第一部惊险片。作者的根据，并不是虚构出来的，而是真实的生活素材，是解放大西北战争中的真人真事
  （这种平常人无法想像的英雄事迹，在我们的伟大的人民解放军中间是不可胜数的）。作者根据这个真实的题材，选择了各种具有惊险性质的情节，把它们安置在一个特定的环境中进行艺术的加工，从而完成了我们现在所看到所喜爱的惊险影片。它的许多情节是惊险，但又是真实的，因而也是有艺术的说服力的。譬如当侦察员们经过千惊万险终于上了华山北峰之后，他们找寻第二条道路的侦察任务已经完成，只要回头向上级报告，便可以调遣山下的战斗部队来消灭敌人。可是当他们越过天桥的时候，不但木桥已断，而且连依靠着过来的唯一的松树根也被拔断，当夜返回去的可能性是完全没有了，如从另一条路绕道下山，就要延误了整个部队进攻的部署。这样，才给我们的英雄们创造了一个发挥高度的爱国主义精神和表现他们的机智、勇敢的机会。如果在这种紧迫情况之下侦察员们不随机应变，不以积极的进攻精神向敌人斗争来找寻出路，势必造成巨大的错误。毛主席教导过我们，当老虎突然在我们面前出现的时候，只有坚决地把它打死才是最好的办法。我们的侦察英雄正是采取了这种办法而取得胜利的。这种把主人翁放在一个意外的然而又是可信的迅速变化的情况中去表现他们的机警、敏捷的判断力和坚决、果断的行动的方法，正是创作惊险片的基本方法。
    此外，导演对于华山的自然风景的描绘也给影片增加了不少力量。那种雄伟、壮丽，白云如带的祖国的大自然景色，不单在画面的构图上显得十分美丽，更主要的是给影片的思想内容作了较好的结合，这一点在我们过去的某些影片中是注意得不够的。我们试设想一下，如果“智取华山”这个主题不是放在华山的真实的背景上来表现的时候，效果就会是另外一个样子。正因为这样一种非凡的英雄行动是在那样壮丽、险峻的背景中发生，因此观众对于英雄们的每一动作就都加倍的注意，对于他们的英勇行为也就感到特别可爱和可敬了。反过来，观众对于那样美好的地方仍然被祸国殃民的蒋介石残余匪帮所盘踞、践踏，也就更加感到愤恨。所以我们的影片应该将祖国的秀丽的山河，如锦如画的自然风景，结合着影片的思想内容充分地表现在银幕上，才能满足广大观众的要求，同时培养了人民特别是青年热爱祖国的感情。这在创造我们电影艺术的民族形式方面也是一个必须注意的问题。
    当然，这样说，并不是认为“智取华山”就是一部完美无缺的影片了。它还有些缺点，最主要的缺点是人物形象方面缺乏性格的描写。在观众面前出现的七个侦察员之中就很难分辨出他们之间有什么不同的独立的性格，有什么不同的精神状态。七个侦察员几乎是一种个性，一种态度，这就不能不减低了它在观众脑海中的印象，从而也就在一定程度上减低了整个影片的感染力了。假如刘参谋这个人物的性格能够描写得更突出一点，使人能够看出他的独特的个性特征的话，那么由于刘参谋这个不能磨灭的英雄形象而起的影响，就会使得整个影片的价值提高一级。如果七个侦察员都各有其自己的个性特征，对待各种情况和各种事物，都各有其自己的表现形态，则整个情节的发展就会增加更多的光彩，因而它的艺术形象的说服力也就会更加强烈，这是一个方面。另外，在战斗部署、战斗动作、个别情节的交代和语言等等方面，也都还或多或少地存在着缺点，这是有待于编剧、导演和演员们在下一部创作中努力的。
    从整个说来，“智取华山”是一部为广大观众所欢迎的影片；有较高思想性与艺术性的作品，从惊险样式方面来看，它又是我们的惊险影片的一个良好的开端。
