    The Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League Issues a Notice on Carrying Out Spring Festival Mass Cultural Activities
    The Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a notice to local Youth League committees on carrying out Spring Festival mass cultural activities. The notice requires Youth League committees in various regions to pay attention to the following in Spring Festival cultural activities: (1) Strengthen ideological leadership in Spring Festival activities. When actively mobilizing and organizing the masses to participate in various cultural activities, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of voluntarism and avoid any coercive orders.
  (2) Activity methods should be adapted to local conditions, taking into account local customs, and focusing on small-scale, diverse activities that are popular with the masses. Avoid pursuing formalism, engaging in large-scale activities, extravagance, and detachment from the masses. (3) In cities (towns), factories, mines, and some rural areas, simple literary and artistic performances, competitions, and other activities can be organized as needed and possible. Some ball game competitions or ethnic-style sports performances can also be appropriately organized. (4) While actively meeting the cultural activity needs of the masses, pay attention to preventing excessive activities that may hinder health or production. (5) Pay attention to discovering and cultivating activists who emerge in Spring Festival cultural activities, and use them as the backbone to establish regular amateur cultural activity organizations, such as singing teams, dance groups, and rural drama troupes.

    发布关于开展春节群众文化活动的通知
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会宣传部向各地团委发布关于开展春节群众文化活动的通知。通知要求各地团委在春节文化活动中注意以下几件事：（一）要加强春节活动中的思想领导，在积极动员和组织群众参加各项文化活动时，必须坚持自愿的原则，不能够有任何强迫命令的作法。
  （二）活动方式要因地制宜，照顾各地的风俗习惯，多搞些小型的为群众喜闻乐见的多种多样的活动，避免追求形式专搞大活动、铺张浪费、脱离群众。（三）在城市（镇）、厂矿和部分农村，可根据需要和可能组织一些简便的文艺会演、比赛等活动，也可适当组织一些球类比赛或民族形式的体育表演。（四）在积极满足群众的文化活动的要求中，要注意防止活动过多，妨碍健康、妨碍生产的现象发生。（五）注意发现和培养在春节文化活动中涌现出来的积极分子，以他们为骨干，建立一些经常的业余文化活动的组织，如歌咏队、舞蹈组、农村剧团等。（新华社）
