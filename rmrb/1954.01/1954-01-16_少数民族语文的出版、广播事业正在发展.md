Thanks to the attention paid by the Party and the People's Government to the development of the languages and scripts of minority nationalities, the publishing and broadcasting undertakings in minority languages are constantly developing.

	Over the past four years and more, the number of books published in minority languages has increased year by year. According to incomplete statistics, in 1951, a total of 176 kinds of books were published in Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, and other minority languages, with more than 2.22 million copies. In 1952, it increased to 376 kinds, approximately 4.39 million copies. Among them, the ethnic language books and periodicals translated and published by the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission alone amounted to more than one million copies by the end of 1952. In January 1953, in order to strengthen the publishing work of minority reading materials, the Nationalities Publishing House was established in Beijing, specializing in compiling and translating books, pictorials, and reading materials on ethnic work in Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, Korean, and other languages.

	Publishing houses in many minority areas also attach great importance to the publication of books and periodicals in ethnic languages, publishing a large number of ethnic language books and periodicals every year. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region published 385 kinds of Mongolian books and periodicals, totaling 3.09 million copies, by the end of July last year. The Mongolian textbooks for primary and secondary schools published by the Inner Mongolia People's Publishing House have been able to supply them in a timely manner since 1953. The Xinjiang People's Publishing House in Xinjiang Province alone compiled and published more than 2.66 million copies of Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, and other ethnic language books and periodicals in 1952. The Yanbian Education Publishing House in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Northeast China has published more than 500 kinds of Korean books, totaling more than 12 million copies, over the past few years. The Compilation Committee of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has compiled approximately 250 kinds of documents in both Tibetan and Chinese since its establishment in 1952, and has also compiled Tibetan textbooks and teaching materials for the Tibetan Language School and Lhasa Primary School in the Tibet Military Region.

	A major political event in the cultural life of minority nationalities is the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" translated into ethnic languages. The single volume of the first volume of the Mongolian "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was printed in 170,000 copies. The first edition of 68,000 copies printed in March last year was sold out within three months. By the spring of last year, more than 375,000 copies of the single volume of the first volume of the Uyghur and Kazakh "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" had been distributed. The second volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Mongolian, Uyghur, and Kazakh languages is being translated and published, and some single volumes translated into Mongolian and Uyghur have already been published. The publication of these ethnic language books has made a great contribution to the dissemination of Marxism-Leninism.

	Many minority nationality areas have also published newspapers and periodicals in ethnic languages. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region publishes the Mongolian Inner Mongolia Daily and Inner Mongolia Propagandist, Militia News, Inner Mongolia Education, and other newspapers and periodicals. Among the sixteen newspapers distributed in Xinjiang, there are four in Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, and Xibe languages. The Xibe ethnic group, with a population of approximately 12,000 living in Xinjiang, saw the publication of a newspaper in their own ethnic language for the first time in history—New Life News. In addition, newspapers published in ethnic languages include the Northeast Korean People's Daily in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Northeast China, the Tibetan Minjiang Daily in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province, the Qinghai Tibetan Daily in Qinghai Province, the Gannan Daily in Tibetan and Chinese in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu Province, and the Xichang Mass Daily in the new Yi language version in the Xichang Special District of Xikang Province. People of all ethnic groups warmly welcome these newspapers and periodicals published in their own ethnic languages, affectionately calling them "Chairman Mao's newspapers" and "our own newspapers."

	Radio broadcasting in ethnic languages is also developing. The Central People's Broadcasting Station has broadcasting programs in Mongolian, Tibetan, Korean, and other ethnic languages, and many minority areas have also built their own broadcasting stations. The Second Station of the Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station in the eastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has fixed Mongolian broadcasting programs every day. The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Northeast China has the Yanbian People's Broadcasting Station, which mainly broadcasts in Korean. The Southwest People's Broadcasting Station and the Qinghai People's Broadcasting Station both have Tibetan broadcasting programs. The Xinjiang People's Broadcasting Station also broadcasts in Uyghur every day.

    少数民族语文的出版、广播事业正在发展
    由于党和人民政府重视发展少数民族语言文字的工作，少数民族语文的出版、广播事业正在不断发展。
    四年多来，少数民族文字出版的书籍一年比一年增加。据不完全的统计，一九五一年用蒙、藏、维吾尔、哈萨克等民族文字出版的书籍共一百七十六种，二百二十二万多册。一九五二年增为三百七十六种，约四百三十九万册。其中仅中央民族事务委员会截至一九五二年底翻译出版的民族文字的书刊就有一百多万册。一九五三年一月，为了加强少数民族读物的出版工作，在北京成立了民族出版社，专门编译蒙、藏、维吾尔、哈萨克、朝鲜等族语文的书籍、画刊及民族工作方面的读物。
    许多少数民族地区的出版机关也非常重视民族文字书刊的出版工作，每年都出版大量的民族文字书刊，内蒙古自治区到去年七月底止出版了蒙文书刊三百八十五种，共三百零九万册。内蒙古人民出版社出版的中小学蒙文教科书，从一九五三年起已能及时供应。新疆省的新疆人民出版社仅一九五二年编译出版的维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古等族语文书刊就发行了二百六十六万多册。东北的延边朝鲜族自治区的延边教育出版社，几年来出版的朝鲜文字书籍共五百多种，一千二百多万册。中国人民解放军西藏军区所属的编译委员会，自一九五二年成立以来，先后编译了藏汉两种文字的文件约二百五十多种，并为西藏军区藏文藏语学校和拉萨小学编译了藏文课本和教材。
    在少数民族人民文化生活中具有重大政治意义的事件，是翻译成民族文字的“毛泽东选集”的出版。蒙文的“毛泽东选集”第一卷单行本即印刷了十七万册，去年三月份印刷的第一版六万八千册，三个月内即销售一空。维文、哈文的“毛泽东选集”第一卷单行本到去年春天已发行了三十七万五千多册。蒙、维、哈三种语文的“毛泽东选集”第二卷正在翻译出版中，翻译成蒙文、维文的一部分单行本已经出版。这些民族语文书籍的出版，对传播马克思列宁主义有很大贡献。
    许多少数民族聚居地区还出版了民族文字的报刊。内蒙古自治区出版了蒙文的内蒙古日报和内蒙古宣传员、民兵报、内蒙古教育等报刊。在新疆发行的十六种报纸中，包括维文、哈文、蒙文和锡伯文四种，居住在新疆的人口约一万二千人的锡伯族在历史上第一次出现了用自己民族文字出版的报纸——新生活报。此外用民族语文出版的报纸还有东北延边朝鲜族自治区的东北朝鲜人民报、四川省藏族自治区的藏文岷江报、青海省的青海藏文报、甘肃省甘南藏族自治区的藏汉文对照的甘南报、西康省西昌专区的西昌群众报新彝文版。各族人民非常欢迎这些用本民族语文出版的报刊，他们亲切地称呼它为“毛主席的报纸”、“我们自己的报纸”。
    使用民族语言的无线电广播事业也在发展。中央人民广播电台设有蒙、藏、朝鲜等民族语言的广播节目，许多少数民族地区也建设了自己的广播电台。在内蒙古自治区东部内蒙古人民广播电台第二台，每天有固定的蒙语广播节目。东北的延边朝鲜族自治区有主要用朝鲜语广播的延边人民广播电台。西南人民广播电台和青海人民广播电台都设有藏语广播节目。新疆人民广播电台每天也用维吾尔语广播。
