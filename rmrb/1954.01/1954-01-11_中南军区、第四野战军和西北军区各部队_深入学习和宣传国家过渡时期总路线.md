    Central-South Military Region, Fourth Field Army, and Northwest Military Region Troops
    Deeply Study and Propagate the General Line for the Transition Period
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army Central-South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army have universally launched the propagation of the national general line for the transition period throughout the entire army. Encouraged by the general line, the broad commanders and fighters have further enhanced their political consciousness and greatly strengthened their patriotic enthusiasm and fighting will to defend the great construction of the motherland.
    Since mid-November of last year, the Central-South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army have vigorously carried out the propagation of the general line. Responsible cadres of various units have personally delivered reports. Many organs and units stationed in various provinces and cities have also invited responsible cadres from provincial, municipal, and prefectural committees to give reports. People's armed cadres of various local public security forces have also participated in the transmission meetings organized by local authorities. Many units have also conducted transmission at various meetings they convened, in conjunction with their work. Cadres of directly subordinate organs and units stationed in Guangzhou in the Central-South Military Region listened to transmission reports from acting commander of the Central-South Military Region, Ye Jianying, Director of the Political Department of the Central-South Military Region, Tao Zhu, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee South China Sub-bureau, Li Xinqing, and Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPC, He Wei. Organs and units stationed in Wuhan organized several large report meetings. The Propaganda Department of the Political Department of the Central-South Military Region also compiled and printed various propaganda materials and popular reading materials.
    The broad commanders and fighters of the various provincial military regions and armies in the Central-South region have expressed their support for the general line with practical actions. The fighters of the fourth squad of the fourth company of a certain unit who vigilantly guard the skies of the motherland day and night on the anti-aircraft artillery positions are determined to further improve their skills and protect the safety of the motherland. After hearing the report on the general line, a certain unit guarding Guangzhou City expressed its guarantee to heighten vigilance and prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements. All the commanders and fighters of the second battalion of a certain unit were very excited after hearing the report from the unit's responsible cadres, and they guaranteed to save grain and protect the local granary. Many commanders and fighters wrote letters to their families and relatives in the countryside, urging them to sell their surplus grain to the state. The father of soldier Shi Dianzi of the first company of a certain unit came to visit him in the army, and he immediately urged his father to sell the surplus grain to the state. All the cadres and fighters of the second platoon of the seventh company of a certain unit made a merit plan in military study, guaranteeing to better learn the advanced Soviet military science in this year's regular training. The atmosphere of valuing thrift and cherishing weapons, equipment, and public property has generally increased in various units. After hearing the transmission of the general line, a certain unit participating in the construction project of the Boshan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Huai River saved 1.35 billion yuan in the project before the end of 1953. After hearing the transmission report, the soldiers of a company of a certain unit automatically saved their surplus money. The cooking squad of the fourth company of a certain unit put forward a plan to cherish grain, guaranteeing not to waste a single grain of the state.
    After hearing the report on the general line, many people's armed cadres in various provincial military regions in the Central-South region generally clarified the direction of rural work and actively propagated the general line to the peasants. Many people's armed cadres actively participated in grain purchase work and took the lead in mobilizing families to sell grain. Ten people's armed cadres in Huixian County, Xinxiang Military Sub-district, Henan Military District, mobilized their families to sell more than 14,000 kilograms of surplus grain.
    In order to further vigorously propagate the general line in the entire army, the Party Committee and Political Department of the Central-South Military Region have made special studies. In the directly subordinate organs and units of the military region, the Party Committee appointed more than 20 responsible cadres as reporters. In preparation for the transition to systematic learning of the general line, the Political Department of the Military Region held a training class for representatives of propaganda section (chiefs) and theoretical instructors in mid-December of last year.
    Also reported: Since mid-November of last year, various units of the Northwest Military Region have universally conducted general line propaganda and education for cadres and soldiers. Responsible comrades and administrative leaders of the Party committees of various units personally reported to their subordinates; responsible comrades of some units also personally led cadres in learning.
    In order to prepare for systematic learning of the general line, political organs at all levels of the Northwest Military Region have begun to collect relevant documents and materials. The Political Department of the Military Region has compiled reference materials for cadre study into a booklet, and is currently preparing to print supplementary teaching materials for soldiers. In order to cooperate with the study and conduct vivid and lively propaganda and education for cadres and soldiers, the Political Department has notified film teams of various units to go to the companies on tour to show films such as "Happy Life," "Golden Star Hero," "Donbass Miners," and "Chengdu-Chongqing Railway." The Culture Department of the Political Department is preparing to set up a general line study exhibition room. Some units have transferred Party member cadres with a certain level of political theory to hold general line study training classes to cultivate propaganda backbone.

    为进一步在全军大张旗鼓地宣传总路线，中南军区党委和政治部曾专门作了研究。在军区直属机关、部队中，党委指定二十多位负责干部任报告员。并为转入系统的总路线学习作准备，军区政治部在去年十二月中旬集训了宣传处（科）长和理论教员代表。 
    又讯：西北军区各部队，自去年十一月中旬起，普遍向干部、战士进行了总路线宣传教育。各部队党委负责同志和行政首长，亲自向所属作了报告；有些单位的负责同志，并亲自领导干部进行了学习。
