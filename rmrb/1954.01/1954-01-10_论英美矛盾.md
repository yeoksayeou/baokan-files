On Anglo-American Contradictions
　　　　Britain 　Du De
　　　　III. The Policies of British Imperialism
What countermeasures do the British ruling class adopt towards the American offensive against British imperialism?

Undoubtedly, they will never succumb to this offensive. We must avoid simplifying the issue by viewing all the upper-level politicians as lackeys of the United States, willing to offer the empire with both hands to their American masters for the ultimate goal of world counter-revolution, and willing to sacrifice the empire for this sacred conquest. On the contrary, British imperialists have engaged in and continue to engage in a stubborn struggle to restore their imperial status and thwart American schemes. This can be seen in America's constant accusations that Britain is "dragging its feet" in fulfilling its obligations and engaging in deception regarding trade restrictions. For example, on the issue of trade with China, McCarthy threatened to use the U.S. Navy against British shipping in the Far East.

Similarly, the total of 2.7 billion pounds of "aid" given to Britain by the United States since the war was not actually used for consumer goods needed by the British people, but was spent on overseas military expenditures and capital exports to expand and maintain the empire. Between 1946 and 1950, American aid totaled 1.787 billion pounds. From 1946 to 1951, Britain's overseas military expenditure amounted to 903 million pounds, and capital exports to the sterling area amounted to 996 million pounds, totaling 1.899 billion pounds.

The same policy can be seen in the struggle to preserve imperial preferences, in protecting the sterling bloc against the dollar, or in the secretive atmosphere surrounding Australian atomic research, which excludes American observers.

　　　　Insurmountable Contradictions
Given that British imperialism so strongly resists the offensive of American imperialism, one might ask, then why do they in fact surrender to American imperialism at so many junctures? The answer lies in the insurmountable contradictions in which British imperialism finds itself.

First, due to its economic weakness, it relies on American capital to survive; they cannot supply the capital needed by their empire. Thus, we see Lyttelton begging American capitalists to invest in their colonies, while at the same time insisting that British sovereignty will be preserved. However, as "The Economist" magazine pointed out, if Britain is no longer the main supplier of capital to the empire, then the British Empire will soon cease to be an empire.

Second, they are in a strategically disadvantageous position because the empire depends on overseas communications, and today the United States holds the world's sea and air superiority. Therefore, they know that they can only maintain their empire with the promise of the United States, and thus believe that they have no choice but to maintain a military alliance with the United States.

Third, they are trapped in the same contradiction as they were between the two world wars, namely, they are attempting to fight on two fronts simultaneously, against socialism and colonial liberation movements, and against competing American imperialism. The same contradiction was manifested in the Munich policy towards Hitler. Today, the Munich policy is being revived on a larger scale. They believe that, even if there are conflicts of interest, it is still necessary to form a counter-revolutionary alliance with the United States.

Due to these contradictions, a practical policy of submission and successive surrenders has emerged—a unique adversarial partnership between these two imperialist powers.

This contradiction has led to a confused and wavering policy towards the endless American encroachment on the British Empire. The most prominent manifestation of this submissive attitude is the constant fawning attitude of Australian Prime Minister Menzies. In September 1952, he said: "I feel very angry when I hear people impulsively denounce American imperialism. The goodwill of a great nation is naturally beneficial to mankind. If that is American imperialism, let us have more of it."

　　　　Unstable Situation
This situation in Anglo-American relations is extremely unstable. In the aforementioned adversarial partnership, as Britain's crisis deepens, the adversarial elements grow and the contradictory tendencies sharpen.

Thus, a situation has emerged as predicted by Stalin in 1952, when Stalin said: "Capitalist Britain, followed by capitalist France, will ultimately have to break free from the embrace of the United States and come into conflict with the United States."

Today, this process is already emerging. Growing anti-American sentiment is also evident among officials. There have already been public disagreements on issues such as the Far East, China and the Dulles-Syngman Rhee policy, on the Middle East, on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and Britain's demands for revision, on Churchill's advocacy of great power consultation and negotiations with the Soviet Union while Eisenhower, supported by influential Conservative Party members in Britain, expressed resistance. Just as in the Munich era, signs of division have begun to appear in the Conservative Party camp today, and more and more imperialists are shocked by the policy of surrendering to American imperialism.

This new development is extremely important. It greatly increases the opportunities for the British people to oppose American rule and fight for peace.

But does this mean that we can sit back and wait for the British ruling class to implement the liberation of Britain from American rule for us? No. The main reasons are twofold: First, the policies of British imperialism, even when it attempts to resist the demands of American imperialism to some extent, appear extremely weak and wavering, due to their contradictory position, and the result is still continued new surrenders. For example, following Churchill's May initiative was Salisbury and Butler's shameful trip to Washington, where they expressed submission on the China issue and on the Sixteen-Nation Declaration supporting the plan to expand the war in the Far East.

Second, British imperialists are attempting to find a solution to the problem by intensifying attacks on the living standards of the British people and the colonial peoples, in order to maintain their empire, expand exports, restore capital exports, and accumulate gold reserves. To this end, they declare that their program is to make Britain "economically independent of the United States."

The Labour Party's program, "Challenge to Britain," also puts forward the same goal. Over the years, the exploitation of the colonies has been extremely intensified, which is reflected in the rise of sterling's purchasing power and the deterioration of the British people's living standards that have been caused for these purposes. Now they are demanding more "unavoidable sacrifices" from the people in the name of so-called establishing Britain's "independence" from the dollar, while in fact they still retain all the shackles of the North Atlantic Alliance, trade restrictions, and American military occupation. This is not the road to the liberation of the British people.

　　　　IV. The Policy of the British Communist Party
Our policy of liberating Britain from American rule is completely different from the policy of the imperialists, even when they have partial conflicts with American imperialism. Such conflicts, although limited, are extremely important. It increases the opportunity for mass struggles to form a broad national liberation front; and we even support very limited measures against American rule. For example, we will wholeheartedly cooperate with all those who wish to lift restrictions on East-West trade, including some influential capitalists, even if they continue to support a military alliance with the United States in other respects.

But we believe that this struggle is a struggle for the British people to seek liberation for their own benefit and to restore national independence from American rule, and to open the road to social and economic progress in Britain. Based on this, we strive for all strata of people who are willing to resist American rule, including the middle class and capitalists, to support such a policy of ours. But given the reasons mentioned above, we believe that it is most important that the British working class must take the lead in this struggle for national independence. Only the working class can become the resolute leader of the national independence struggle.

Specifically, we demand the following measures:

(1) Abolish the economic fetters of trade restrictions to develop British trade with all non-dollar countries and end dependence on the dollar.

(2) End the military occupation of Britain and demand that American troops and American bombers withdraw to the United States.

(3) Lift Britain's constraint by the North Atlantic Treaty, which is in fact a military alliance in which the United States uses Britain as a pawn.

(4) Restore Britain's freedom of diplomatic action, initiate great power consultations, which the United States can participate in if it is willing, and which it can do without if it is unwilling, and reach agreements with the Soviet Union and China.

(5) Liberate Britain from the heavy burden of the current colonial wars, which are not only an attack on the genuine independence of the colonial peoples and put a heavy economic and military burden on Britain, but also in fact force Britain to ally with the United States.

When we demand the national independence of the British people, we also demand the independence of all nations of the British Empire. The struggle of the British people and the colonial peoples is more closely linked than ever before. The American invasion and rule is directed not only at Britain, but also at all countries of the British Empire. Therefore, the struggle for liberation is a common struggle.

We advocate that all the peoples of the British Empire, the peoples of the Dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan and Ceylon in Asia, and the peoples of the semi-colonies in the Near East and other places, the colonial peoples of Southeast Asia, Africa and the West Indies, unite in a powerful common struggle for national independence and peace.

Finally, it can be said that the advancement of this struggle for independence today has more favorable conditions than ever before. The United States is not as overwhelmingly powerful as the myth that American imperialist propagandists have trumpeted. On the contrary, the American rulers have never been as isolated as they are today, which is even evident in the meetings of the United Nations General Assembly. The policies of the American rulers have fallen into unprecedented predicaments and contradictions.

In Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, a fierce wave of opposition to American world expansion and hegemony has developed and is constantly growing.

We say: Let Britain lead this struggle for liberation from American rule. We can win great victories, not only for Britain and solving our own problems, but also for world peace and the progress of all peoples. (To be continued)

    论英美矛盾
    英国 　杜德
      三、英帝国主义的政策
    英国统治阶级对于美国对英帝国主义的攻势又采取怎样的对策呢？
    毫无疑问是绝不会对这一攻势屈服的。我们必须防止把问题简单化了，这就是把上层政客们全都看成是美国的奴才，甘愿为了世界的反革命的最终目的，把帝国双手奉送给他们的美国主子，为了这种神圣的征伐而甘愿牺牲帝国。正相反，英帝国主义者曾经进行并继续进行顽强的斗争，以恢复其帝国地位和挫败美国的诡计。这可见于美国的不断责难英国在履行其义务时“拖沓不前”和在贸易限制上实行欺骗。例如和中国贸易的问题，麦卡锡曾威胁要以美国海军来对付英国在远东的航运。
    同样地，战后以来美国给予英国的总共二十七亿英镑的“援助”，事实上不是用在英国人民所需的消费品上，而是花在海外军费及资本输出以扩充与维持帝国的事业。在一九四六年到一九五○年之间，美国援助共十七亿八千七百万英镑。从一九四六年到一九五一年，英国的海外军费开支达九亿零三百万英镑，对英镑区的资本输出为九亿九千六百万英镑，两下共合为十八亿九千九百万英镑。
    同样的政策可见于为保存帝国特惠制的斗争上，见于保护英镑集团反对美元上，或见于排斥美国观察员的澳洲原子弹研究的秘密气氛中。
        无法克服的矛盾
    由于英帝国主义之如此强烈地反击美帝国主义的攻势，人们也许会问，那末为什么在事实上他们又在这许多关节上向美帝国主义投降呢？答案在于英帝国主义正陷于无法克服的矛盾中。
    第一，由于其经济上的衰弱，因而要依靠美国资本为生，他们不能够供应他们帝国所需的资本。于是我们看到李特尔顿在乞求美国资本家向他们的殖民地投资，同时却又坚持说英国的主权将被保留。然而正如“经济学家”杂志所指出的，如果英国不再是帝国的资本的主要供应者，则英帝国很快就将不复为英帝国了。
    第二，他们在战略上居于不利地位，因为帝国有赖于海外交通，而今天美国却握有世界的海、空优势。所以他们知道只有在美国的允诺下他们才能保持其帝国，因而认为不得不维持与美国的军事同盟。
    第三，他们陷在正如在两次世界大战之间所陷入过的矛盾中，那就是他们企图同时在两条战线上作战，一方面反对社会主义与殖民地解放运动，一方面反对与他们竞争的美帝国主义。同样的这种矛盾曾显现于对希特勒的慕尼黑政策中。今天正在更大规模地重新恢复慕尼黑政策。他们认为，纵使有利害冲突，仍势必要与美国结成反革命的同盟。
    由于这些矛盾，就产生了顺从及接连屈服的实际政策——这两个帝国主义强国之间的独特的敌对的合伙关系。
    这种矛盾导致了对于美国对英帝国无止境的入侵所采取的混乱和摇摆的政策。这种屈从的态度表现得最突出的，要数澳大利亚总理孟席斯的经常流露的吹拍态度了。他在一九五二年九月里说过：“当我听到人们冲动地诟骂美帝国主义时，我感到非常生气。一个伟大民族的善意要求自然是有益于人类的。假如那就是美帝国主义，就让我们多来一点吧。”
      不稳定的局面
    英美关系的这种局面是极不稳定的。在上述的敌对合伙关系中，当英国的危机日益深重时，敌对成分增长，矛盾的趋向尖锐化。
    于是出现了如斯大林在一九五二年所预言的局面，斯大林在那时说：“资本主义的英国，接着还有资本主义的法国，归根到底将不得不从美国的怀抱里挣脱出来，同美国发生冲突。”
    今天这个进程已呈现出来了。日益增长的反美情绪在官方人士中也有所表露。像在远东、中国及杜勒斯—李承晚政策上，在中东的问题上，在关税贸易总协定和英国要求修改的问题上，在邱吉尔主张大国协商及与苏联谈判而艾森豪威尔在英国有势力的保守党分子支助下表示抗拒的问题上，都已有了公开的分歧了。正如在慕尼黑时期一样，今天在保守党阵营中已开始显出分裂的征象，在帝国主义分子中愈来愈多的人震惊于对美国帝国主义屈服的政策。
    这种新发展极为重要。它大大增加了英国人民反对美国统治和争取和平的斗争的机会。
    但这是不是说我们就可以坐下来静待英国统治阶级给我们实行从美国统治下解放英国呢？不是的。其主要理由有二：首先，英帝国主义的政策，即使当它企图对美帝国主义的需求作某种程度的抗拒时，也是显得极其软弱和动摇不定的，这是由于它们处于矛盾的地位，而结果还是继续从事新的屈服。例如，继邱吉尔的五月倡议之后是萨斯柏利与巴特勒的可耻的华盛顿之行，他们在中国问题上及支持扩大远东战争的计划的十六国宣言上表示屈服。
    其次，英帝国主义者企图采取加紧进攻英国人民和殖民地人民生活水平的方法来觅致问题的解决，以维持其帝国，扩大输出，恢复资本输出及积储黄金贮备。为此，他们宣称他们的纲领是使英国“在经济上不依赖美国”。
    工党的纲领“向英国挑战”，也提出同样的目标。这些年来，对殖民地的剥削已极度地加强，这表现在英镑支付力的上升以及为了这些目的已造成的英国人民生活水平的恶化。如今它们又在所谓建立英国对美元的“独立”的名义下要求人民作更多的“不可免的牺牲”，而事实上它们却仍然把北大西洋联盟、贸易限制及美国军事占领等桎梏全部保留下来。这不是英国人民解放的道路。
      四、英国共产党的政策
    我们使英国从美国统治下解放出来的政策是与帝国主义分子的政策迥然不同的，即使是在他们与美帝国主义发生局部冲突时亦然。他们这样的冲突，虽属有限，却是极其重要的。它增加了形成广泛的民族解放阵线的群众斗争的机会；而我们甚至支持反抗美国统治的很有限的措施。例如，我们将衷心地与所有愿望解除东西方贸易限制的人们合作，包括一些有势力的资本家们，即使他们在其它方面是继续支持与美国的军事同盟的。
    但我们认为这个斗争是英国人民为了自己的利益而谋求解放和从美国统治下恢复民族独立，以及打开英国社会与经济进步道路的一个全民的斗争。基于此，我们争取所有愿意反抗美国统治的各阶层人民，包括中等阶级及资本家，支持我们这样的一个政策。但鉴于上述的原因，我们相信最重要的是，英国工人阶级必须在这个争取民族独立的斗争中居领导地位。只有工人阶级才能成为民族独立斗争的坚决的领导者。
    具体说来，我们要求采取下列措施：
    （一）废除贸易限制的经济箝制，以发展英国与一切非美元国家的贸易，和结束对美元的依赖。
      （二）结束对英国的军事占领，要求美国军队及美国轰炸机撤回美国。
    （三）解除英国受北大西洋公约的约制，这个公约事实上是美国利用英国作爪牙的军事同盟。
    （四）恢复英国的外交行动自由，倡议举行大国协商，假若美国愿意的话可以参加进来，如若不愿意可以不必要它参加，而与苏联及中国取得协议。
      （五）使英国从目前的殖民地战争的重担下解放出来，这些战争不仅仅是对殖民地人民的真正独立的进攻和使英国背上沉重的经济与军事负担，而且事实上迫使英国与美国结盟。
    当我们要求英国人民的民族独立的时候，我们同时也要求英帝国的各民族的独立。英国人民与殖民地人民的斗争，比以往更紧密地连结起来了。美国的入侵与统治不仅是针对着英国，也针对着英帝国的所有各国。因此，争取解放的斗争是一个共同的斗争。
    我们主张英帝国的全体人民，加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰，亚洲的印度、巴基斯坦和锡兰各自治领的人民，与近东及其他各地方的半殖民地的人民东南亚非洲和西印度群岛的殖民地人民，在强大的争取民族独立与和平的共同斗争中联合起来。
    最后，可以说，今天这一争取独立的斗争的推进，有着从来未有过的有利条件。美国并非像美国帝国主义的宣传家所大事吹嘘的神话那样的强大无比。正相反，美国统治者从来未有过像今天这样的孤立，这甚至可见之于联合国大会会议中。美国统治者的政策已陷于从未有过的窘困与矛盾之中。
    在欧洲、亚洲、非洲以及拉丁美洲，一股猛烈的反对美国的世界扩张与霸权的浪潮已发展起来并正不断在增涨。
    我们说：让英国来领导这个从美国统治下谋解放的斗争吧。我们能赢得伟大的胜利，不只是为了英国和解决我们自己的问题，也是为了全世界的和平与各族人民的进步。　　（续完）
