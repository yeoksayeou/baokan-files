　　Promote the Spirit of Loving Work and Hard Struggle of Party Members in Government Offices
　　Zhang Weizhen, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the Songjiang Province

Currently, the entire Party is earnestly studying the Party's general line during the transition period. Through this study, every one of our Party members will deeply understand the relationship between the Party's general line during the transition period and each of our tasks, and with each of our Party members personally, thereby clarifying the direction of progress, inspiring work enthusiasm, and enhancing confidence in the cause of socialist construction. The members of Party organizations in government offices are largely cadres; they are the leading backbone of the revolution, and the specific executors and implementers of the Party's policies. How well these comrades study is related to the implementation of the Party's general line. Therefore, our Party organizations in government offices should actively lead and organize Party member cadres to study the general line well.

The Party's general line and general task during the transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce over a considerably long period. The Party's general line during the transition period shines like a lighthouse for us. We should follow the Party's general line and implement and embody it in all our work. However, implementing the Party's general line and general task during the transition period is not an easy task, but an extremely complex and arduous political and organizational task, as well as a long-term educational and ideological construction task. When carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, a fierce class struggle will be unfolded, and this class struggle will inevitably be reflected in the ideological struggle within the Party. People's thoughts (including those of Communist Party members) either consciously or unconsciously belong to the ideological system of the working class or the ideological system of the bourgeoisie. Our Party is the political party of the working class, which requires every Party member to possess a complete communist working-class ideology. Only in this way can we educate the entire working people to transform the world and transform society. Precisely because of this, we must specifically distinguish the ideological boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie in our work and production, consciously and actively struggle against all non-working-class ideas, and enhance our resistance to the erosion of bourgeois ideology. This is a problem that must be solved by our Party members in government offices when studying the general line.

Based on the actual situation and requirements of the work in government offices, the following two specific issues should be addressed in this study of the general line: one is how to cultivate a good atmosphere of loving one's job; the other is to continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle. Although these are old issues, they have not been completely resolved, so it is still necessary to raise them.

Through the study of the general line, every one of our Party members should deeply realize that every task, every specific task in our government offices is directly related to the Party's general line and general task. There is no Party work or professional work that does not serve the realization of the Party's general line. Therefore, every Party member should truly be at ease with their work ideologically, love their work, further develop their enthusiasm and creativity, and better complete the work tasks assigned by the Party. After the "Three-Anti" Movement and the Party Rectification Movement, the vast majority of comrades want to do their jobs well. However, there are still some comrades who are not at ease with their work. There are many reasons why they are not at ease with their work. A few people are indeed because of improper work assignments or because of many difficulties in their work, but the more common reason is that many of them have various personal plans. For example, some comrades believe that working in government offices is a "department store" or a "jack-of-all-trades," and it is better to go to factories and enterprises to "specialize in one field"; some comrades are unwilling to do clerical or technical work, saying that doing these jobs has no "future"; and even some comrades are dissatisfied with their status and treatment, believing that people who used to work with them have now become some kind of "chief," and so on. Of course, for those who are indeed improperly assigned and can be transferred at present, ways can be found to transfer them; but this is a matter of organizational leadership, not a personal matter of Party members, so it must be decided by the organization. For comrades who request a transfer because of difficulties in their work, the Party organization should mobilize and educate them to give play to the spirit of Communist Party members who are brave in overcoming difficulties, actively improve themselves, and catch up with the needs of the work. Special attention should be paid to helping them gradually improve their professional skills. For those who proceed from personal interests and personal reputation and status, criticism should be carried out, pointing out that this kind of individualism is essentially a reflection of bourgeois ideology within the Party. Therefore, Party organizations in government offices must pay attention to strengthening ideological education for these comrades, criticize their erroneous ideas through the study of the general line, and make them realize that every task in our government offices is related to the realization of a socialist future, and every achievement in our work makes the socialist elements of our country continue to grow. For example, if a statistician does the statistical work correctly and accurately, that is a guarantee for the country's planned construction; if there is no statistician's work, or if the statistical work is not done well and errors occur, then the accuracy of the country's construction plan will be affected. Other jobs are also like this. We should understand that the achievement of no great work is not created and accumulated by the silent, long-term, and arduous labor of millions of people. Therefore, every Party member should follow Lenin's instructions: "Less fine words, more ordinary, everyday deeds" ("The Great Beginning"), and conscientiously do the work assigned to them by the Party. This is an obligation that a Communist Party member with communist consciousness must fulfill. Otherwise, building socialism is empty talk. Therefore, Party organizations in government offices must educate Party members to bring the enthusiasm for participating in the socialist construction of the motherland into their own work, love their own work, and regard doing the current professional work well as their duty and responsibility to strive for socialism.

Secondly, through the study of the general line, every Party member should further realize the relationship between today and tomorrow, the relationship between personal interests and national interests, and the relationship between immediate interests and long-term interests, so that every Party member can consciously carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, endure certain temporary difficulties, and struggle for the realization of the socialist industrialization of the country. Our Party has a fine tradition of hard struggle. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, under extremely difficult financial and economic conditions, all anti-Japanese base areas across the country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, implemented streamlined administration, tightened belts, produced for self-sufficiency, overcame various difficulties, and achieved the great victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. After entering the cities, some comrades began to abandon the fine tradition of hard struggle. For example, some people simply pursue personal material enjoyment and care about personal living standards; some people are reluctant to leave the big cities and are unwilling to work in the countryside. The revolutionary work enthusiasm and enterprising spirit of these people are declining, and they are no longer willing to live a hard life. Some people often only see the partial (small unit) and temporary interests, while forgetting or ignoring the overall and long-term interests. Isn't it often heard that there are too few means of transportation to meet everyone's needs; there are too few kindergartens and nurseries; clubs and canteens should be expanded; there are too few dormitories; why are the wages of government office workers not adjusted, and so on. In short, it is to improve the material and cultural living standards of government office workers. Yes, some of these issues need to be resolved, and the state is gradually resolving them. In fact, since the liberation of the whole country, the lives of the people and all government office workers across the country have greatly improved. However, the improvement of our lives must be subordinate to the development of production, and we cannot demand that the improvement of living standards exceed the speed of production development.

The basic task of the country's first five-year plan is to concentrate major forces on developing heavy industry. To develop heavy industry requires more funds. Therefore, during our period of realizing socialist industrialization, we cannot but tighten our belts and work hard. If we demand too much to increase wages and improve welfare benefits, the country will not be able to accumulate funds, the great cause of socialist industrialization of the country cannot be realized, and there is no question of a socialist future; at the same time, the improvement of the lives of our government office workers should be in line with the improvement of the lives of the people, and we cannot put forward excessive demands that deviate from reality. Therefore, we must subordinate the temporary interests in our current lives to the long-term interests of the country's socialist industrialization. Today we endure temporary difficulties precisely for the sake of a happy tomorrow. Stalin once said that in order to realize the country's socialist industrialization, "it is also necessary to be willing to endure sacrifices, and to implement extreme savings in all aspects, saving on food, saving on education funds, saving on cloth, in order to accumulate the necessary funds for creating industry" ("Speech at the Graduation Ceremony of Students of the Red Army Academy in the Kremlin"). Therefore, every Party member in our government offices must continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, obey the needs of national construction, do their best to save manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and use every penny that can be saved for the country's economic construction, and strive to realize the socialist industrialization of the country.

When there is still a bourgeoisie in society, some weak-willed people in our Party may be eroded. Therefore, Party organizations in our government offices must attach great importance to and strengthen ideological leadership in their daily work, and constantly pay attention to and struggle against bourgeois ideas that invade the Party. At the same time, they should pay special attention to overcoming the bad tendencies of Party member cadres such as being uneasy with their work and making trouble about living standards. The basic way to overcome these bad tendencies is to urge and lead every Party member to diligently study Marxism-Leninism. The more Party members understand Marxism-Leninism, the less various bourgeois individualistic ideas can squeeze in, and the more powerful they will be to resist the erosion of various bourgeois ideas. For those Party member cadres who have already been infected with these bad tendencies, the Party organization should improve the Party's organizational life, earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and educate and urge them to correct their mistakes. Party organizations and administrative departments in government offices should also handle these issues realistically and according to the specific circumstances. For those comrades who are indeed improperly assigned to work, they should consider adjusting their work. For those comrades whose lives are indeed difficult and therefore affect their work, they should also care for them and appropriately solve their difficulties. At the same time, Party organizations and administrative departments should often care about the work and living conditions of government office cadres. They should often take various effective methods to improve everyone's professional skills according to the needs of the work, and constantly improve everyone's living and welfare conditions according to needs and possibilities. If Party organizations and administrative departments in government offices can strengthen the political and ideological education of Party members, improve the level of awareness of Party members, and practically solve various problems in the work and life of Party member cadres, they can greatly promote the enthusiasm, creativity, and hard-working spirit of our Communist Party members in government offices, thereby promoting and improving the various tasks of our government offices and successfully completing the country's construction plan.

　　发扬机关党员热爱工作和艰苦奋斗的精神
    中共松江省直属机关委员会副书记　张伟振
    目前全党正在认真地学习党在过渡时期的总路线。通过这一学习，将使我们每一个党员深刻地了解到党在过渡时期的总路线与我们每一项工作的关系，与我们每个党员个人的关系，从而明确前进的方向，鼓舞工作热情，增强对社会主义建设事业的信心。机关党组织的成员极大部分是干部，他们是革命的领导骨干，是党的政策的具体执行者与贯彻者。这些同志学得好坏，关系着党的总路线的贯彻执行。因此，我们机关中党的组织应积极领导和组织机关党员干部学好总路线。
    党在过渡时期的总路线总任务，是要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业、对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。党在过渡时期的总路线像灯塔一样照耀着我们，我们应遵循党的总路线，在各项工作中贯彻与体现党的总路线；但贯彻党在过渡时期的总路线总任务不是一件轻而易举的事，而是一个异常复杂的艰巨的政治任务和组织任务，也是一个长期的教育工作和思想建设工作。在对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造时，就要展开激烈的阶级斗争，而这种阶级斗争将不可免地反映到党内的思想斗争中。人们的思想（包括共产党员在内）都在自觉地或者不自觉地不是从属于工人阶级思想体系，就是从属于资产阶级思想体系。而我们的党是工人阶级的政党，就要求每一个党员必须具备完全的共产主义的工人阶级思想。这才能够教育全体劳动人民来改造世界改造社会。正因为如此，就要我们在工作中、生产中具体地划清工人阶级和资产阶级的思想界限，自觉地积极地向一切非工人阶级思想进行斗争，增强我们对资产阶级思想侵蚀的抵抗力。这是我们机关党员学习总路线必须解决的一个问题。
    根据机关工作的实际情况和要求，在这次学习总路线中应当注意解决以下两个具体问题：一是如何养成热爱自己工作岗位的风气；一是继续发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神。虽然这都是老问题，但是还没有完全解决，所以还有提出来的必要。
    通过总路线的学习，要使我们每一个党员深刻认识到：我们机关的每一项工作，每一项具体任务都是与党的总路线总任务直接相关联的，没有一件党的工作或业务工作不是为实现党的总路线而服务的。因而每个党员应该真正从思想上安心于自己的工作，热爱自己的工作，以进一步发挥自己的积极性和创造性，更好地完成党所给予的工作任务。经过“三反”运动和整党运动，绝大部分同志都想把工作做好。但是还有一部分同志是不安心工作的。他们不安心工作的原因很多，有少数人确是因为工作分配不当，或者是自己工作中困难较多，但是比较普遍的原因却是因为他们中许多人存在着各种各样的个人打算。比如有些同志认为在机关工作是“百货摊”、“万金油”，不如到工厂企业去“钻一门”；有些同志不愿意做事务性或技术性的工作，说做这些工作没有“出息”；甚至有些同志对自己的地位待遇不满，认为过去和自己一块工作的人现在已当了什么“长”等等。当然，对于实在分配不当，目前又可以调动的，可以设法予以调动工作；但是这是组织领导问题，不是党员个人问题，因此必须由组织来决定。对于因为工作上遇到困难而要求调动的同志，党组织应当动员和教育他们发挥共产党员勇于克服困难的精神积极提高自己，赶上工作需要，特别应注意帮助他们逐渐提高业务能力。对于从个人爱好出发，从个人名誉地位出发的要进行批判，指出这种个人主义思想实质上是资产阶级思想在党内的反映。因此，机关的党组织必须注意对这些同志加强思想教育，通过总路线的学习，批判他们的错误思想，使他们认识到：我们机关的每一件工作，都是与实现社会主义前途相关联着的，我们工作中每一成就，都使我们国家的社会主义因素不断地增长。比如统计员把统计工作做得正确无误，那就是对国家有计划建设的一个保证；如果没有统计员工作，或统计工作做不好，出了错误，那末，国家建设计划的准确性就要受到影响。其他工作也是这样的。应该懂得没有一件伟大工作的成就，不是由千百万人民无声无息的长期的艰苦的劳动所创造与积累起来的。因此，每个党员应当遵照列宁的指示：“少说些漂亮话，多做些日常平凡的事情”（“伟大的创举”），认真地把党交给自己的工作做好。这是一个具有共产主义觉悟的党员所必须履行的义务。否则，建设社会主义就是空谈。因此，机关的党组织必须教育党员把参加祖国社会主义建设的热情发挥到自己的工作中去，热爱自己的工作，把做好当前的业务工作作为自己为社会主义而奋斗的义务和责任。
    其次，通过总路线的学习，应该使每一个党员进一步认识到：今天和明天的关系，个人利益和国家利益，眼前利益和长远利益的关系，从而使每一个党员能自觉地发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，忍受某些暂时的困难，为实现社会主义的国家工业化而斗争。我们党是有着艰苦奋斗的优良传统的，抗日战争时期，在财政经济极端困难条件下，全国各抗日根据地在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，实行精兵简政，节衣缩食，生产自给，克服了各种困难，取得了抗日战争的伟大胜利。进入城市以后，有些同志开始丢掉了艰苦奋斗的优良传统。比如，有些人单纯追求个人物质享受，计较个人生活待遇，有的人留恋大城市生活，不愿到农村工作。这些人的革命工作热情和进取心正在衰退着，已不愿再过艰苦的生活。有些人往往只看到局部（小单位）与暂时的利益，而忘记了或不顾全局与长远的利益。不是可以常常听到这样一些话吗：交通工具太少，不能满足大家的需要；幼儿园、托儿所太少了；俱乐部、食堂应该扩大；宿舍太少了；机关工作人员工资为什么不加调整等等。总之一句话，就是要提高机关工作人员的物质与文化生活水平。是的，其中有些问题是需要解决的，国家也正在逐步解决中。事实上，全国解放以后，全国人民和全体机关工作人员生活都有了很大的改善。但是我们生活的改善必须服从生产的发展，不能要求生活水平的提高超过生产发展的速度。
    国家第一个五年计划的基本任务是集中主要力量发展重工业。而要发展重工业就需要较多资金，所以，在我们实现社会主义工业化时期就不能不节衣缩食、艰苦奋斗。如果我们过高地要求提高工资，提高福利待遇，国家就不能积累资金，国家社会主义工业化的伟大事业就不能实现，社会主义前途更谈不上；同时，我们机关工作人员的生活提高，也应与人民生活的提高相适应，而不能离开现实提出过高的要求。因此要把我们眼前生活中暂时的利益，服从于国家社会主义工业化的长远利益。今天我们忍受暂时的困难，正是为了幸福的明天。斯大林曾经讲过，为了实现国家的社会主义工业化“也就必须甘愿担受牺牲，在各方面实行极端节省，节省饮食，节省教育经费，节省布匹，以求积累创立工业所必要的资金”（“在克里姆林宫举行的红军学院学生毕业典礼大会上的演说”）。因此，我们机关的每一个党员必须继续发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，服从国家建设的需要，尽力节约人力、物力和财力，把可以节省的每一文钱都用到国家经济建设事业上去，为实现社会主义的国家工业化而奋斗。
    当社会上还有资产阶级存在的时候，我们党内有些意志薄弱的人就有被侵蚀的可能。因此，我们机关的党组织必须在日常工作中十分重视和加强思想领导，时时注意和侵袭到党内来的资产阶级思想进行斗争，同时特别注意克服党员干部中的不安心工作、闹生活待遇等不良倾向。克服这些不良倾向的基本办法在于督促和领导每一个党员努力地学习马克思列宁主义。党员们越多懂得马克思列宁主义，就越能把各种资产阶级的个人主义思想挤得更少，就越有力量抵御各种资产阶级思想的侵蚀。对于那些已经沾染了这些不良倾向的党员干部，党组织应该健全党的组织生活，认真地开展批评与自我批评，教育和督促他们改正错误。机关中的党组织和行政方面还应该实事求是地分别情况来处理这些问题，对于那些确实因为工作分配不当的同志，应该考虑调整他们的工作，对于那些生活确实困难因而影响工作的同志，也应该关心他们，适当地为他们解决困难。同时，党组织同行政方面还应该经常地关怀机关干部的工作状况和生活状况，要根据工作的需要经常地采取各种有效方法来提高大家的业务水平，并且根据需要与可能不断地改善大家的生活福利状况。机关的党组织和行政方面如果能够这样一方面加强对党员的政治思想教育，提高党员的觉悟程度，一方面切实地解决党员干部工作中和生活中的各种问题，就可以大大地发扬我们机关共产党员的积极性创造性和艰苦奋斗精神，从而推进和提高我们机关的各项工作，顺利地完成国家的建设计划。
