　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 23rd: Construction of North Korea's first automobile factory is intensifying. Once fully completed, the factory will be able to produce 6,000 automobiles annually by 1957.

　　Many technicians and workers, as early as the difficult period of the Fatherland Liberation War – December 1951, following the decision of the Republic's Cabinet, began work on the construction of this automobile factory. In the spring of 1952, Premier Kim Il-sung visited the factory to provide guidance, greatly inspiring the construction workers' enthusiasm for labor and promoting the progress of the construction project. By the end of 1952, the factory had completed the construction of some equipment and began producing more than ten kinds of automobile parts such as cylinders in advance; since June 1953, with the increase of equipment, it has been able to produce thirty kinds of automobile parts.

　　After the Korean armistice, the work of building the automobile factory became more active. Every day, dozens of large trucks loaded with machinery, building materials, and daily necessities drove to the construction site. More and more new buildings appeared on the construction site, including spacious factory buildings, neat staff dormitories, as well as consumer cooperatives, clubs, and canteens. The scale of the factory also expanded rapidly. It can now produce forty kinds of parts and has advanced equipment including thousands of new-style lathes. The number of workers is also constantly increasing, and many new workers are carefully studying and have quickly mastered the technology. At the same time, a Czechoslovakian technical team consisting of eight technicians has arrived at the factory after a long journey to assist in the work. Under their guidance and help, all factory employees improved technology and increased the productivity of automobile parts. Among them, the output of cylinders has tripled compared to a year ago, and the quality has also improved significantly; the productivity of steering shafts has increased four or five times compared to the past. Lathe operator Li Zhenjiu, under the specific guidance of Czechoslovakian technicians, transformed a kind of cutting tool and lathe device, making the cutting efficiency more than fifty times higher than before.

　　All factory employees wrote a letter to their beloved leader Premier Kim Il-sung, expressing their desire to strive to start producing automobiles in 1956, and determined to complete the task of producing 6,000 automobiles annually in 1957.

    朝鲜第一个汽车工厂的建设工程加紧进行
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜第一个汽车工厂的建设工程正在加紧进行。这个工厂完全建成后，到一九五七年可年产汽车六千辆。
    许多技术人员和工人们，早在祖国解放战争的艰苦时期——一九五一年十二月，就遵照共和国内阁的决定，开始建设这个汽车工厂的工作。一九五二年春，金日成首相曾到该厂指导，大大鼓舞了建设人员的劳动热情，并推进了建设工程的进展。到一九五二年年底，该厂已完成了部分设备的建设，提前开始了汽缸等十多种汽车机件的生产；从一九五三年六月起，随着设备的增多，已能生产汽车机件三十种。
    朝鲜停战后，建设汽车工厂的工作更加活跃。每天有几十辆大卡车满载着机器设备、建筑器材和日用必需品驶到工地来。建设工地上出现了愈来愈多的新的建筑物，有宽敞的厂房，有整洁的职工宿舍，还有消费合作社、俱乐部和食堂等。工厂规模也扩大得很快，现在能够生产机件四十种，并拥有包括千百台新式车床的先进设备。工人人数也不断增多，许多新工人精心钻研，已很快地掌握了技术。同时，由八位技术人员组成的捷克斯洛伐克技术队，经过长途旅程，已经到该厂协助工作。全厂职工在他们的指导和帮助下，改进技术，提高了汽车机件的生产率。其中，汽缸的产量比一年前提高了三倍，质量也有显著提高；方向轴的生产率比过去提高了四、五倍。镟盘工李镇玖在捷克斯洛伐克技术人员的具体指导下，改造了一种车刀和镟床的装置，使切削效率比过去提高了五十倍以上。
    全厂职工写信给自己敬爱的领袖金日成首相，表示要争取在一九五六年开始生产汽车，并决心在一九五七年完成年产汽车六千辆的任务。
