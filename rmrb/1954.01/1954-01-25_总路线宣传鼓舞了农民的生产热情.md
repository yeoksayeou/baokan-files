The General Line Propaganda Inspired Peasants' Enthusiasm for Production

　　Collective Purchase of Production Materials

More than two thousand agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province, when studying the General Line and discussing production issues, recognized the importance of national socialist industrialization from concrete examples of industry supporting agriculture. Therefore, they resolved to strengthen agricultural production cooperatives and increase grain production to support national industrial construction. According to statistics from 1,994 agricultural production cooperatives in 22 counties including Pingshun and Xiyang, and the suburban areas of Taiyuan and Datong, they sold more than 5.6 million jin of surplus grain to the state and raised over 4.23 billion yuan to collectively purchase production materials such as waterwheels, walking plows, large livestock, and soybean cakes. Among them, the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Datong alone collectively bought seventeen large livestock and 1,500 jin of sesame cakes after collectively selling more than 200,000 jin of grain. Agricultural production cooperatives in various places also invited nearby non-member farmers to participate in the study of the General Line. After hearing the summary report, the non-member farmers greatly improved their socialist consciousness and actively requested to join the cooperatives. In Changxing Township, Huguan County, eight mutual aid teams and seventy-eight farmer households requested to join the cooperatives. They collectively sold surplus grain and purchased twelve large livestock and more than 300 large and small farm tools to prepare for the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives.

　　Strive to Increase Production by 260,000 Jin of Grain

After being educated on the General Line, the farmers of Qipan Mountain Village in Weichang County, Rehe Province, have sold more than 240,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. After the grain purchase work was completed, village cadres and party members continued to publicize the national General Line, calling on the masses to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and strive to harvest more grain. While carrying out propaganda, village cadres helped each group hold meetings, resolved internal problems in the spirit of unity and production, and under the principles of democracy and mutual benefit, and established some systems. After rectification, the group members were in high spirits. Among the thirty-six mutual aid teams in the village, the number of permanent teams has increased from twelve to twenty, and one permanent team is preparing to transform into an agricultural production cooperative. Each group has also formulated a plan to increase grain production. Driven by mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the village has formulated an agricultural production plan. The total grain output of the village will be increased by another 260,000 jin on the basis of last year's 1.1 million jin. It is also required to apply fertilizer to all grain crops, buy thirty draft animals, and twenty-two units of carts, plows, shovels, and other machinery. At present, they have purchased fifteen draft animals and three waterwheels, and have begun to make ropes, repair farm tools, and prepare for other production work.

　　The More In-Depth the Propaganda, the Greater the Enthusiasm for Production

Before the propaganda of the General Line in Geliu Township, Dantu County, Jiangsu, some cadres and activists believed that the autumn harvest had passed and they should rest. They were not actively leading production, and the production enthusiasm of some of the masses was also unstable. Therefore, the Geliu Township Branch of the Communist Party of China determined that the propaganda of the General Line must be combined with winter production. Through inspection of production, it was decided to seize the time to carry out weeding of wheat fields, washing ponds to accumulate fertilizer, and applying fertilizer to fields, and arrangements were made at the Township People's Congress. When conducting propaganda to farmers, through recollection, comparison, and detailed accounting, farmers realized that the gradual improvement of their lives in the past four years was due to the great increase in production. In this way, cadres and the masses further established the idea of ​​active production. Many activists promoted the General Line to the masses while engaging in production. Farmer Li Zhaofu said: "Neither production nor study can be delayed. If production is not done well, there will be no good harvest next year; if the General Line is not studied well, we will not be able to recognize the path forward." Encouraged by the General Line, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has generally increased, and a winter production upsurge has been widely launched. More than 6,400 mu of the township's 6,700 mu of wheat fields have been weeded once, and a few have been weeded twice; a total of ninety ponds have been washed, accumulating enough pond mud for 2,400 mu of fields; pig and sheep manure has been applied to 1,200 mu of fields. They are also preparing to wash another forty-five ponds, accumulate fertilizer for 2,100 mu of fields, and generally weed the wheat fields once. (Zhao Fuxiang)

　　Quickly Shift to Winter Production After Selling Grain

After the propaganda of the General Line in the Third Village of Pufu Township, Jiangjin County, Sichuan, the farmers understood that they must take the socialist road for everyone's lives to improve. After selling more than 100,000 jin of grain to the state, the farmers actively shifted to winter production. The original twenty-one mutual aid teams that had fallen apart were reorganized and expanded by thirty-one households, and another twenty-nine farmers formed four new mutual aid teams. The Wu Yichen mutual aid team is creating conditions to prepare to transform into an agricultural production cooperative. After delivering the grain, they immediately held a meeting to study production, formulate plans, and arrange work. The Wu Yichen mutual aid team divided the sixteen laborers in the team according to their technical division of labor, ten people to shovel field walls and cultivate field banks, two people to plow the fields, two people to harrow the fields, and two people to carry manure to make manure pits. In this way, everyone worked very hard, plowing and harrowing more than ten mu of fields and making sixteen small manure pits in one day. They calculated that the work done by sixteen people in one day would have required twenty-seven people to complete before studying the General Line. The Zhang Guicai mutual aid team originally planned to only plow the fields twice before the end of the year, but after studying the General Line, they plowed them three times. In addition, farmers from four mutual aid teams bought more than 1.3 million yuan worth of fertilizer after selling grain, and also bought four piglets to raise and accumulate fertilizer to prepare for increasing grain production. (Yi Hua)

　　Turning Around the Idea of Winter Idleness

After replanting grass seeds (for fertilizer), the members of the Yao Xujiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiatang Township, Shangyu County, Zhejiang, had the idea of ​​taking a break. It was generally believed that winter production could be done slowly, unlike spring plowing and summer planting, which had to meet the season. Some said: Farmers work hard for half a year and are idle for half a year, so they have to rest in winter. In previous years, more than one hundred workdays of river mud had been collected by this time, but this year it has not yet started. Some people said: There is little river mud this year and it is difficult to collect, so we will buy some fertilizer in the future. After the propaganda of the General Line began, township cadres used specific examples to conduct comparative education in response to this idea. For example, Huang Madeng's 2.4 mu of sandy ridge fields could only yield more than 400 jin per mu, but by draining the cold spring water through ditches and changing the soil quality by carrying river mud, they yielded more than 600 jin per mu. On the other hand, some people's grass seeds grew poorly and they did not apply river mud. Although they bought some commercial fertilizer, the harvest was still very low. Through the education of realistic examples, the members fully realized the importance of winter production and turned around the idea of winter idleness and rest. The cooperative also made an overall plan for the entire winter production work and all labor. All male and female members of the cooperative were mobilized to actively carry out various productions.

　　Changed the Old Habits of Many Years

The Liu Runhe mutual aid team in Sanjiao Township, Xin County, Shanxi Province, has twelve laborers and six livestock, and is a very strong mutual aid team. However, they only helped each other during the busy seasons of spring, summer and autumn every year, and disbanded in winter. Everyone followed the local old habit of winter idleness and rest. People stayed at home to warm themselves by the fire and chat, and the livestock were tied up in the sun. When spring came, sending manure, sowing seeds, and collecting firewood were all urgent tasks, and often one could not take care of everything. Because of this, not only did they not increase production last year, but the whole team's average production decreased by 5%. After studying the General Line, they accepted the lessons of last year's production decrease and also realized that they must do a good job in winter production, harvest more grain to support national construction, and only then can everyone's lives improve. After selling the surplus grain, they bought four livestock and a large cart, and signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to purchase fertilizer. The team also reasonably organized labor and livestock, assessed work and recorded points, so that everyone had work to do and no one suffered losses. Now the whole team is actively carrying out winter production work such as collecting firewood, sending manure, preparing the land, and repairing ditches. They also set a plan to strive to increase grain production by 40 jin per mu this year and sell 9,200 jin of grain to the state. (Ren Ziming)

　　Found the Correct Path for Sideline Production

In the past, the farmers in Tuzhu Township, Leshan County, Sichuan, were unclear about the direction of sideline production. Many farmers emphasized sideline production over agriculture, and even abandoned agriculture to engage in speculative business. After studying the General Line, the farmers criticized their own thinking of emphasizing sideline production and business over agriculture, and found the correct path for engaging in sideline production by relying on their own labor. At present, many farmers have stopped engaging in business activities, withdrawn their capital to purchase agricultural tools or deposit it in the bank, and put all their manpower into agricultural production. Two of the three major weirs in the township have been repaired, and the intertillage, weeding, and topdressing of all spring crops have been completed. Mutual aid teams with a better foundation have also formulated production increase plans. Sideline production has changed its commercial nature in the past, so that agricultural and sideline production are well combined. (Yang Qikang Liu Maosen)

    总路线宣传鼓舞了农民的生产热情
      集体购买生产资料
    山西省二千多个农业生产合作社的社员，在学习总路线和讨论生产问题时，从工业支援农业的具体实例中，认识到国家社会主义工业化的重要性，因而决心壮大农业生产合作社，增产更多的粮食，支援国家工业建设。据平顺、昔阳二十二县和太原、大同两个市郊区的一千九百九十四个农业生产合作社的统计，共向国家出售余粮五百六十多万斤，集资四十二亿三千二百余万元集体购买水车、步犁、大牲口、豆饼等生产资料。其中单是大同陈家庄农业生产合作社在集体售粮二十多万斤后，就集体买了十七头大牲口，一千五百斤麻饼。各地农业生产合作社在学习总路线中，还邀请了附近的社外农民参加。社外农民听到总结报告后，社会主义觉悟大大提高，积极要求入社。壶关县常行乡有八个互助组和七十八户农民要求入社，他们已集体出售余粮，购买十二头大牲畜和三百多件大小农具，为成立农业生产合作社作准备。
    争取增产二十六万斤粮食
    热河省围场县棋盘山村农民，受到总路线教育后，已把二十四万多斤余粮卖给国家。购粮工作结束后，全村干部、党员继续宣传国家总路线，号召群众参加互助合作组织，争取多收粮食。在进行宣传的同时，村干部帮助各组召开会议，本着团结生产的精神，在民主、互利的原则下，解决了组内问题，并建立一些制度。经过整顿后，组员情绪很高，全村三十六个互助组中，常年组已由十二个增加到二十个，并有一个常年组准备转成农业生产合作社。各组并都订出了增产粮食的计划。在互助合作组织的带动下，全村已制订了农业生产计划。全村的粮食总产量要在去年一百一十万斤的基础上，再增产二十六万斤。并要求粮食作物全面施肥，买耕畜三十头，车、犁、铲?机等二十二台。现在，他们共已买进耕畜十五头，水车三台，并开始打绳子拴套、修理农具，作其他各项生产准备工作。
    宣传越深入生产劲头越大
    江苏丹徒县葛留乡在宣传总路线以前，有些干部和积极分子认为秋征已过，应该休息休息了，不积极领导生产，部分群众生产情绪也不稳定。因此，中共葛留乡支部便确定总路线的宣传必须和冬季生产相结合，通过检查生产，确定抓紧进行麦田锄草、洗塘积肥、推肥下田等工作，并在乡人民代表大会上作了布置。在向农民进行宣传时，通过回忆、对比、算细账，使农民认识到四年来生活的逐步改善是由于生产的大大提高。这样一来，干部和群众都进一步树立了积极生产思想，不少积极分子一面生产一面向群众宣传总路线。农民李照富说：“生产学习都不能耽误，生产搞不好，明年不能丰收；总路线学不好，就认不清前进的道路”。在总路线的鼓舞下，农民生产情绪普遍高涨，广泛掀起冬季生产热潮。全乡六千七百多亩麦田已有六千四百多亩锄过一次草，少数已锄过两次；共洗塘九十个，积了够上二千四百亩田的塘泥；推了一千二百亩田的猪羊粪。还准备再洗塘四十五个，积二千一百多亩田的肥料，把麦田草普遍锄一次。　（赵复骧）
    卖粮后迅速转入冬季生产
    四川江津县普福乡三村经过宣传总路线以后，农民都懂得了必须走社会主义的道路，大家的生活才会过好。全村农民在卖给国家十万多斤粮食以后，又积极转入冬季生产。原来垮掉的二十一个互助组又组织起来，并扩大了三十一户，另有二十九户农民新组成了四个互助组。乌义臣互助组正在创造条件，准备转成农业生产合作社。他们在送完粮食以后，马上就开会研究生产，制订计划，安排了活路。乌义臣互助组把全组十六个劳动力按各人技术分工，十个人铲田壁、培田坎，两人耖田，两人耙田，还有两人担粪作粪坑。这样，大家干起活来都很起劲，一天内就耖、耙田十多亩，作了十六个小粪坑。他们自己算了一下账，这一天十六个人做的活路，在学习总路线以前需要二十七个人才能完成。张桂才互助组原来准备年前只耖二道田就算了，学习总路线后，耖了三道。另有四个互助组的农民卖粮后买了一百三十多万元的肥料，还买了四只猪仔养着积肥，为增产粮食作准备。

      扭转冬闲思想
    浙江上虞县夹塘乡姚许江农业生产合作社的社员们，在补种完草子（作肥料用）以后，曾产生了歇劲思想。普遍认为：冬季生产慢慢来，不比春耕夏种要赶季节。有的说：务农人半年辛苦半年闲，冬季里得歇歇啦。往年这时已经弄了一百多个工的河泥，今年这时还没开始，有的人便说：今年河泥又少又难弄，将来买点肥料算啦。宣传总路线开始后，乡干部针对这一思想情况，用具体事例进行对比教育。如黄马登的二亩四分沙质垄田，本来每亩只能收四百多斤，由于挖沟排出了山泉冷水，担河泥改变了土质，每亩收了六百多斤。另有些人草子长得差，河泥又没上，虽然买了点商品肥料，收成还是很低。通过现实事例的教育，社员们充分认识到冬季生产的重要，扭转冬闲歇劲思想。社内并把整个冬季生产工作和全部劳动力作了通盘筹划。全社男女社员都动员起来积极进行各项生产。
                                      （黄坚）
      改变了多少年的旧习惯
    山西忻县三交乡刘润和互助组有十二个劳动力、六头牲口，是一个劳动力很强的互助组。但他们每年只在春夏秋三季生产紧张时互助，一到冬季就散伙。大家依照当地冬闲休息的旧习惯，人在家里烤火谈天，牲口拴着晒太阳。到了春天，送粪、下种、打柴，样样生产都要紧，常常是照前顾不了后。就因这样，去年不但没有增产，全组平均还减产百分之五。学习总路线以后，他们接受了去年减产的教训，同时也认识到必须搞好冬季生产，多收粮食支持国家建设，才能使大家生活过好。他们在卖出余粮后就买进了四头牲畜、一辆大车，并和供销合作社订立了购买肥料的合同。组内又把劳动力和牲畜进行合理组织，评工记分，使得人人有活干，家家不吃亏。现在全组都在积极进行打柴、送粪、整地、修沟等冬季生产工作。并订出争取今年每亩增产粮食四十斤，全组卖九千二百斤粮食给国家的计划。

      找到副业生产的正确道路
    四川乐山县的土主乡农民，过去因对副业生产的方向不明确，不少农民重副业轻农业，甚至丢掉农业去做投机买卖。学习总路线以后，农民们批判了自己重副业、轻农业，经营商业的思想，找到了依靠自己劳动进行副业生产的正确道路。目前许多农民都停止了做生意的活动，抽出资本购买农具或存入银行，人力全部投入农业生产。全乡三条大堰已修补好两条，全部小春作物的中耕锄草和追肥工作都已完成。基础较好的互助组并订了增产计划。副业生产中已改变了过去的商业性质，使农副业生产很好地结合起来。　　（杨启康　刘茂森）
