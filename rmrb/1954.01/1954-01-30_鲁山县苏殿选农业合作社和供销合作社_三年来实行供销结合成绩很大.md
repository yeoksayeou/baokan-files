The Lushan County Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Malou Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Lushan County, Henan Province, have achieved great results in combining supply and marketing over the past three years. The two parties have now signed a combination contract for 1954.

As early as 1951, when the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative was still a mutual aid team, it had regular contact with the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. That spring, the mutual aid team lacked ginger seeds for planting ginger, so the Supply and Marketing Cooperative bought thousands of catties of ginger seeds from Fangcheng, ensuring timely planting for the mutual aid team. Subsequently, it supplied the mutual aid team with cake fertilizer, insecticides, and threshing furniture, and purchased their grain, ginger, tobacco, and other agricultural and sideline products. In 1952, when the Su Dianxuan mutual aid team transformed into an agricultural production cooperative, it officially signed a combination contract with the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and continued to sign a contract in 1953. Over the past three years, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has supplied the Su Dianxuan Cooperative with production materials such as cake fertilizer, fertilizer powder, insecticides, waterwheels, ox carts, new-style plows, and some living materials, with a total value accounting for 69.3% of the Su Dianxuan Cooperative's purchases. In terms of procurement, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased wheat, corn, ginger, vermicelli, and other agricultural and sideline products from the Su Dianxuan Cooperative, with a total value of more than 50 million yuan, accounting for 47.5% of the total value of agricultural and sideline products sold by the Su Dianxuan Cooperative.

The combination of the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Malou Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative has produced good results. First, it has promoted the realization of the Su Dianxuan Cooperative's agricultural production increase plan. In the spring of 1952, wheat in the cooperative was infested with red spiders, and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative promptly supplied 250 catties of "666" powder, enabling them to quickly eliminate the pests in 118 mu of wheat fields. In May 1953, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative supplied waterwheels, enabling the Su Dianxuan Cooperative's plan to turn 50 mu of dry land into paddy fields to be realized on schedule. Over the past three years, the output of the Su Dianxuan Cooperative has continued to increase, reaching an average yield of 630 catties per mu in 1953, an increase of 285 catties compared with the average yield of 345 catties per mu in 1950. This is inseparable from the timely and strong support of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Secondly, it greatly avoided the intermediate exploitation of speculators and saved manpower and animal power. The production materials and living materials supplied by the Supply and Marketing Cooperative to the Su Dianxuan Cooperative were lower than market prices; the price of agricultural and sideline products purchased by the Supply and Marketing Cooperative from the Su Dianxuan Cooperative was higher than the price offered by merchants. The combination of the Su Dianxuan Cooperative and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also saved a lot of manpower and animal power. In the past, they had to go to Zhangliangji (eight li from Malou Township) or Fangcheng (110 li from Malou Township) to buy and sell things, which was very inconvenient. Over the past three years, they have saved 26 man-days and 24 ox-days by buying more than 15,000 catties of fertilizer from the Supply and Marketing Cooperative compared to going to the nearer Zhangliangji to buy it. Including the expenses of people and the fodder of animals, the savings were even greater. Liu Yongtai, the accountant of the Su Dianxuan Cooperative, happily said after calculating this account: "It's really great to be linked with the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Our production difficulties have been solved, and we have saved so much money." Member Liu Zitai said: "It's really beautiful now. As long as we put forward our plans and requirements, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative will prepare them for us. We don't have to worry, and it doesn't delay production."

The Malou Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative has linked the production of the Su Dianxuan Cooperative with the national plan through combination contracts, enabling the cooperative to gradually sever its ties with private merchants. In 1951, the materials supplied by the Supply and Marketing Cooperative to the Su Dianxuan Cooperative accounted for only 48.4% of the cooperative's purchases, which increased to 71.3% in 1952 and further increased to 73.8% in 1953; while the proportion of the cooperative's purchases from private merchants decreased year by year. In 1951, buying things from private merchants accounted for 42.2% of the cooperative's purchases, which fell to only 22% in 1953. (In addition to buying things from the Supply and Marketing Cooperative and private merchants, the cooperative also bought some things from state-owned stores, but the proportion was very small.) The Malou Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative implemented the principle of serving agricultural production for farmers, which also gave itself a long-term reliable customer and strengthened the planning of business management.

Recently, after examining the shortcomings in the implementation of combination contracts in the past (such as weak planning and strict enforcement of combination contracts), the Su Dianxuan Cooperative and the Malou Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative have further realized the benefits of implementing combination contracts. Under the common goal of working together to do a good job in this year's large-scale production, they have signed the 1954 annual quarterly and monthly combination contracts. In addition, rules for the implementation of the contract have also been formulated. (Li Pengde)

　　鲁山县苏殿选农业合作社和供销合作社
　　三年来实行供销结合成绩很大
    河南省鲁山县苏殿选农业生产合作社和该县马楼乡供销合作社，三年来实行供销结合，取得很大成绩。现在双方已经签订了一九五四年的结合合同。
    苏殿选农业生产合作社在一九五一年还是互助组时，就和供销合作社发生了经常的联系。那年春天，互助组种姜没有姜种，供销合作社就去方城买回姜种数千斤，保证了互助组适时下种；随后又供给了互助组饼肥、杀虫药剂及打场家具，并收购了他们的粮食，姜、烟叶和其他农副业产品。到一九五二年苏殿选互助组转为农业生产合作社时，就和供销合作社正式签订了结合合同，一九五三年并继续签订合同。三年中供销合作社供应给苏殿选社饼肥、肥田粉、杀虫药剂、水车、牛车、新式步犁等生产资料及部分生活资料，其总值占苏殿选社购买数的百分之六十九·三。在收购方面，供销合作社收购苏殿选社的小麦、玉米、姜、粉条及其他农副业产品，总值五千多万元，占苏殿选社卖出农副业产品总值的百分之四十七·五。
    苏殿选农业生产合作社和马楼乡供销合作社结合，产生了很好的结果。首先是促进了苏殿选社的农业增产计划的实现。一九五二年春天，该社小麦发生了红蜘蛛，供销合作社及时供给了二百五十斤“六六六”药粉，使他们在一百一十八亩小麦地中迅速除灭了虫害。一九五三年五月，供销合作社供应了水车，使苏殿选社五十亩旱地变水田的计划按期实现。三年来苏殿选社产量不断提高，一九五三年平均每亩产量达到六百三十斤，比一九五○年每亩平均产量（三百四十五斤）提高了二百八十五斤。这是和供销社的及时的有力的支持分不开的。其次，大大避免了投机商人的中间剥削，节省了人力畜力。供销社供应苏殿选社的生产资料和生活资料，比市场价格低；收购苏殿选社农副业产品的价钱，比商人出的价钱高。苏殿选社和供销社结合，还节省了很多人力畜力。他们过去买卖东西不是到张良集（距马楼乡八里），就是到方城（距马楼乡一百一十里），往返很不便。三年来他们从供销社买了一万五千多斤肥料，就能比到较近的张良集去买节省二十六个人工和二十四个牛工，加上人的盘费，牲口的草料，节省的就更多了。苏殿选社的会计刘永太，在算了这笔账后高兴的说：“和供销合作社挂上钩，好处真大，咱的生产困难解决了，又节省了这么多钱。”社员刘子太说：“现在真美，只要咱提出计划和要求，供销合作社就给咱准备好了，咱不用操心，还不耽误生产。”
    马楼乡供销合作社通过结合合同把苏殿选社的生产和国家计划联系了起来，使该社逐渐割断和私商的联系。供销合作社在一九五一年供应给苏殿选社的物资，才占该社购买量的百分之四十八点四，一九五二年即增至百分之七十一点三，一九五三年又增至百分之七十三点八；而该社买私商货物的比例却逐年降低了，在一九五一年买私商的东西，占该社购买量的百分之四十二点二，到一九五三年就只占百分之二十二了。（除了买供销社和私商的东西外，该社还买了一部分国营商店的东西，比例很小）。马楼乡供销合作社执行了为农民生产服务的方针，也使自己有了长期可靠的顾主，加强了经营管理的计划性。
    最近，苏殿选社和马楼乡供销社，在检查了过去执行结合合同中的缺点（如计划性不强，结合合同执行得不严格等）后，双方进一步认识了实行结合合同的好处，在协力搞好今年大生产的共同目标下，已经签订了一九五四年度分季分月的结合合同，另外，还制订了合同执行规则。    （李鹏德）
