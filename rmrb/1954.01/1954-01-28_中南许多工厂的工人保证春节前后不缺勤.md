Workers in Many Factories in Central South China Guarantee No Absences Around the Spring Festival

[This newspaper dispatch] To strive to fulfill and overfulfill the production plans for the first quarter of this year, workers in many factories in the Central South region have guaranteed that they will not be absent from work around the Spring Festival. After studying the general line of the state during the transition period, the workers of the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory realized that striving to complete the production plan can accelerate the realization of the country's socialist industrialization. Therefore, they have guaranteed that they will not be absent from work around the Spring Festival. Originally, thirty-four workers in the inspection and assembly workshop wanted to take leave to return to their hometowns during the Spring Festival. Now, only one person has indicated that they will take less leave due to personal matters, while the rest have guaranteed that they will not take leave. Many workers at the Gaokeng Mine of the Pingxiang Coal Mine realize that a good life must be created by their own daily labor. Therefore, they have changed their plans to return home for the Spring Festival. So far, workers from fifteen groups have proposed guarantees of not taking leave, not being absent, and arriving at the mine on time around the Spring Festival. Among the workers' families, many have also decided not to return to their hometowns and are prepared to use the travel expenses to buy construction bonds. All sixteen workers in the sixth group of the sixth workshop of Wuhan No. 201 Factory unanimously stated that they would spend the Spring Festival in the factory and strive to complete the first batch of production tasks this year. Worker Hu Yansong said: "If I am absent for half a day, I will produce 900 fewer shirts, which will affect the group's plan and disrupt the workshop's assembly line operations. Returning home is a small matter, but delaying production is a big matter." Therefore, he canceled his plan to return home. Workers in the third workshop of the Hanyang Machine Factory also proposed three major guarantees during the Spring Festival: no absenteeism, no gambling, and no reckless spending.

　　中南许多工厂的工人保证春节前后不缺勤
    【本报讯】　中南区许多工厂的工人，为了争取完成和超额完成今年第一季度的生产计划，纷纷保证在春节前后不缺勤。郑州纺织机械厂的工人学习国家过渡时期总路线后，都认识到努力完成生产计划能够加速国家社会主义工业化的实现，因此，纷纷保证在春节前后不缺勤。检装车间原来有三十四个工人要在春节期间请假回乡，现在，只有一人因事表示将少请假外，其余的人都保证不请假。萍乡煤矿高坑矿很多工人认识到好日子必须靠自己用日常劳动去创造，因此，改变了春节回乡的计划。到现在，已有十五个小组的工人提出春节前后不请假、不旷工、按时到矿工作的保证。在工人家属中，也有很多人决定不回乡，并准备拿回家的旅费买建设公债。武汉二○一厂六车间第六组全组十六个工人一致表示要在厂里过春节，并努力完成今年第一批生产任务。工人胡炎松说：“旷工半天，我就少生产九百件上衣，影响小组计划，又打乱了车间流水作业；回家事小，耽误生产事大。”因此，他取消了回乡的计划。汉阳机器厂第三车间工人也提出在春节期间的三大保证：不旷工、不赌博、不乱花钱。
