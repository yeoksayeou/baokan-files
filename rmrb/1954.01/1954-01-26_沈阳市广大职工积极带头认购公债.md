The people of all circles in Shenyang Municipality are enthusiastically subscribing to national economic construction bonds. After listening to the live broadcast of the mobilization meeting for workers to subscribe to national economic construction bonds held by the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions on January 9th, the 450,000 workers in Shenyang Municipality actively took the lead in subscribing. All the workers of the National Model Factory - Factory 53, overfulfilled the estimated subscription target within three days. The entire staff of the power workshop of the factory subscribed to 6.1 million yuan under the slogan of striving to realize socialist industrialization. The workers in the plumbing workshop subscribed to 6.69 million yuan in less than twenty minutes and guaranteed to pay ahead of schedule. As of January 19th, according to incomplete statistics, the number of subscriptions by workers in 88 units of the nine industrial systems of state-owned industries, as well as local state-owned industries, state-owned commerce, basic construction units, and workers in government organs, schools, and private industrial and commercial enterprises, has exceeded the estimated subscription target by 6 percent.

The cadres of various government organs and units also enthusiastically subscribed with a high degree of patriotism. The cadres of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in the spirit of "seeking truth from facts" and "acting according to one's ability," enthusiastically subscribed to public bonds based on their specific economic situations. In about a day, the number of public bonds subscribed reached more than 140.4 million yuan, exceeding the subscription target by more than three times, and the subscription work has basically ended. The subscription figures for various units under the Shenyang Municipal People's Government generally exceeded the estimated figures, and some even exceeded them by two to three times. Li Guangxiang, a 63-year-old cook at the Shenyang Branch of the People's Bank of China, used all of his savings of 1.1 million yuan, which he had saved through frugality, to subscribe to public bonds.

    沈阳市广大职工积极带头认购公债
    沈阳市各界人民踊跃认购国家经济建设公债。沈阳市四十五万职工，在一月九日收听了市总工会召开的动员职工认购国家经济建设公债代表会议的实况广播后，就积极带头认购。全国模范工厂——五三工厂全体职工，在三天内就超额完成了预计认购数字。该厂动力车间全体职工在努力实现社会主义工业化的口号下认购了六百一十万元；水暖车间的职工，在不到二十分钟内，就认购了六百六十九万元，并保证提前交款。到一月十九日止，根据不完全统计，国营工业九个产业系统的八十八个单位及地方国营工业、国营商业、基本建设单位以及机关、学校和私营工商业的职工所认购的数字，已超过预计认购数字百分之六。
    各机关单位的干部，也都以高度的爱国热情来踊跃认购。中共沈阳市委会的干部，以“实事求是”“量力而行”的精神，根据自己的具体经济情况，拿出余钱来踊跃认购公债，在一天左右的时间内，认购公债数字即达一亿四千零四十多万元，超额完成认购数字三倍多，认购工作已基本结束。沈阳市人民政府所属各单位认购数字一般都超过了预计数字，有的甚至超过两倍到三倍。中国人民银行沈阳分行六十三岁的炊事员李广祥，把平时省吃俭用积蓄的一百一十万元养老金，全部认购了公债。
