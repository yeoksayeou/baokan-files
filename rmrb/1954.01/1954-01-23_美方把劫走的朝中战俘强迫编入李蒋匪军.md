Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 22nd: The Korean and Chinese prisoners of war detained by the U.S. side are being forcibly incorporated into the armies of the Li Seung-man and Kuomintang bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder. The U.S. pretense of "releasing" POWs as "civilians" has been completely exposed.

According to the International News Service, Li Seung-man's "Minister of National Defense," Sun Yuan-il, stated on the 21st that the detained POWs "will join the South Korean forces, despite the armistice agreement on POWs prohibiting former POWs from serving in Korea again."

In order to conceal the illegal act of forcing POWs to serve as cannon fodder, the Li Seung-man gang is using all kinds of threats and inducements against the detained POWs, forcing them to "voluntarily" enlist. Li Seung-man officials told the POWs that if they agreed to enlist, they could immediately receive a month's salary and be exempt from "investigations by the counter-espionage team," while those who wished to become civilians would have to be investigated by special agencies such as the "counter-espionage team" and the "military investigation bureau," and they "would get nothing and would not know what the future holds." Li Seung-man officials in charge of this matter made no secret of the fact that "if they do not volunteer to enlist, they will be drafted." They stated that ninety percent of the POWs meet the conditions for conscription, so these people must be incorporated into the army.

However, the POWs are unwilling to be sacrificed by the U.S. and Li gangs. While the POWs were being escorted to the Pohang detention camp, despite the heavy guard, many POWs still escaped. Although the Li Seung-man gang made extensive threats from the beginning, according to the Associated Press, during the "preliminary screening" of the POWs who had been escorted to Pohang, more than half of the first group of four hundred people hoped to become civilians and were unwilling to join the Li puppet army. For these POWs who boldly refused, the Li Seung-man gang will obviously spare no effort to persecute them with the most brutal means. Li Seung-man gang military personnel have deliberately spread rumors that there are so-called "communist spies" among the POWs, as a convenient excuse for persecution.

At the same time, the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan is carrying out the same tricks with the assistance of the U.S. authorities. Ye Gongchao of the Kuomintang bandit gang discussed with U.S. "Ambassador" Rankin on the 20th the plan to "handle" the Chinese POWs who are about to be sent to Taiwan. According to a Taipei dispatch from the International News Service on the 22nd, the United States has agreed to allocate funds from the "counterpart fund" for aiding the Kuomintang to build concentration camps for detaining POWs. United Press reported that after the POWs arrive, they will be subjected to "careful screening" and three months of intensive reactionary ideological training in the concentration camps, and then forcibly incorporated into the Kuomintang bandit gang's remnant army. Any POW who slightly expresses unwillingness to die for Chiang Kai-shek will be treated as a "subversive element" and brutally suppressed.

These facts, constantly revealed after the U.S. handed over the forcibly detained POWs to the Li and Chiang bandit gangs, completely expose the most shameless essence of the Washington liars' so-called "human dignity" and "individual rights."

    美方把劫走的朝中战俘强迫编入李蒋匪军
    【新华社开城二十二日电】为美方扣留的朝中战俘正被强制编入李承晚和国民党匪帮的军队中充当炮灰。美方所谓“释放”战俘为“平民”的幌子已经完全拆穿了。
    据国际新闻社报道，李承晚的“国防部长官”孙元一在二十一日表示，被扣留的战俘“将会加入到南朝鲜部队中去，尽管关于战俘问题的停战协定曾禁止前战俘再在朝鲜服役”。
    为了掩饰强迫战俘当炮灰的非法行动，李承晚匪帮对被拘留的战俘进行种种威胁利诱，逼迫他们“自愿”入伍。李承晚官员告诉战俘说，如果他们答应入伍，就可以马上领到一个月薪饷，并免除“反间谍队的调查”，而希望成为平民的人就必须受“反间谍队”和“军事调查局”等特务机关的调查，而且他们“什么也得不到，也不知道前途如何”。负责办理这一事务的李承晚官员毫不掩饰地说，“如果他们不自愿入伍，他们将被征入伍。”他们表示，百分之九十的战俘都合乎被征兵的条件，因此这些人是一定要编入军队的。
    但是，战俘们是不愿作美李匪帮的牺牲品的。当战俘被押送到浦项拘留营的途中，尽管戒备森严，仍有不少战俘逃跑了。李承晚匪帮虽然一开始就大肆威胁，但是，据美联社报道，在对已被押解到浦项的战俘进行“初步甄别”时，第一批四百人中间就有一半以上希望作平民而不愿参加李伪军。对于这些大胆拒绝的战俘，李承晚匪帮显然将不惜用最残暴的手段来加以迫害。李承晚匪帮的军事人员已经故意放出空气说，战俘中间有一些所谓“共产党间谍”，以此作为进行迫害的方便借口。
    与此同时，台湾国民党匪帮正在美国当局的协助下进行同样的勾当。国民党匪帮叶公超二十日与美国“大使”兰金商谈了“处理”即将押送到台湾的中国战俘的计划。据国际新闻社二十二日发自台北的消息，美国已同意从援助国民党的“对等基金”中拨款修建拘留战俘的集中营。合众社报道说，战俘到达以后，将在集中营中受到“仔细的甄别”和三个月紧张的反动思想训练，然后强迫编入国民党匪帮残余军队。任何稍微表示不愿替蒋匪送死的战俘都要被当作“颠覆分子”而遭到残酷镇压。
    美方把强迫扣留的战俘移交李、蒋匪帮以后不断透露出来的这些事实，彻底揭穿了华盛顿说谎家的所谓“人类尊严”和“个人权利”的最无耻的本质。
