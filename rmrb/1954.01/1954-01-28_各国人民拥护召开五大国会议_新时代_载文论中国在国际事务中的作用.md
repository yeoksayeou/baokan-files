Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: In capitalist countries, more and more people realize that major international issues can only be resolved with China's participation. A movement striving for consultations among the five major powers is unfolding widely in these countries.

Asian people are enthusiastically demanding a five-power conference. In India, the All-India Peace Council, at its meeting held in January, passed a resolution hoping that a five-power conference would follow the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The resolution pointed out that without China's participation, it would be impossible to resolve major international issues, especially those related to Asia. Indian public opinion generally supports the Soviet proposal for a five-power conference. The "New Life Daily" published in Lucknow stated in an editorial in early October 1953: "Today, the People's Republic of China must not be ignored in any international consultations."

In Japan, the Japan People's Peace Congress, held in mid-December 1953, emphasized in its declaration the Japanese people's demand for a five-power conference. During the "Peace Month" activities widely held throughout Japan in July and August last year, the Japanese people raised the slogan of demanding a five-power conference at regional peace gatherings held in Chiba City on the Boso Peninsula, Sapporo in Hokkaido, and other places.

The Mawlamyine City Committee for the Defense of World Peace in Burma launched a movement during the Mawlamyine City Buddhist Festival in November 1953, demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, with 5,000 people signing within three days.

More than 1,500 working people in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, sent an appeal to the leaders of the five major powers in October 1953, expressing that the working masses of Baghdad, with different political and religious beliefs, support the proposition of easing international tensions through peaceful methods.

In Europe, due to the general wishes of the people, even many bourgeois politicians and newspapers are demanding a five-power conference with China's participation. The British "Daily Express" on January 26th urged the UK to promote the convening of a five-power conference. It said, "The solution to the Far Eastern problem is impossible without China's participation." The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" also believes that "indefinitely excluding China is not only unwise but also a threat to peace." Thirty Labour MPs in the UK submitted a motion to the House of Commons on November 26th, 1953, requesting the British government to suggest holding a five-power conference.

In France, during the demonstration parade commemorating the storming of the Bastille held in Paris on July 14th, 1953, the French people raised the slogan of demanding the immediate convening of a five-power conference. French public opinion also opposes the attempt by the US ruling clique to deny China's role in international affairs. Even the French right-wing bourgeois newspaper "L'Aurore" asked, "Can people seriously talk about peace in Asia without listening to China's opinion?" "Paris-Presse-L'Intransigeant" and "La Croix" also agree to holding consultations among major powers with China's participation.

People in Rome, Turin, Florence, Milan, and other cities in Italy held many conferences and open-air gatherings in October 1953. At these gatherings, the Italian people expressed their desire to recognize the People's Republic of China and strive for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. The bourgeois newspaper "Corriere della Sera" published in Milan believes that recognizing China is a prerequisite for easing international tensions.

In the Americas, Canada, Guatemala, and other countries have launched nationwide movements calling on the people to support the proposal for a five-power conference. Canada held a national referendum from September 12th, 1953, asking the question: "Do you support a conference of major powers to resolve issues threatening world peace through consultation?" By the end of November 1953, 34,000 people had expressed their opinions, 98 percent of whom said "yes." M.J. Coldwell, leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation of Canada, also called for a five-power conference to study world problems in a speech delivered at the annual Quebec Cooperative Commonwealth Federation provincial conference in November 1953. By the end of 1953, the Guatemalan National Peace Committee had collected more than 51,000 signatures for a petition demanding the defense of national sovereignty and the convening of a five-power conference.

Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: According to TASS Moscow: The fourth issue of "New Times" magazine published an article by Markov entitled "Urgent Tasks."

Markov, in discussing the restoration of the Chinese people's rights and their role in international affairs, emphasized that the People's Republic of China has sufficient strength to shoulder the responsibilities of a major power in maintaining international peace and security.

The author pointed out that the blockade policy has failed. The complete collapse of the policy of blockading China was proven again and again in 1953. He said that most capitalist countries pursuing discriminatory policies have suffered huge losses due to the loss of the large Chinese market. No matter how much pressure Washington exerts, and often regardless of whether there are formal diplomatic relations, the trade relations between many countries in the capitalist camp and China are constantly expanding.

Markov discussed in detail and refuted those who oppose the development of normal relations with the People's Republic of China and their "arguments." He went on to write that the new China's peaceful foreign policy and its great achievements have aroused joy throughout Asia. In the eyes of the people of Asian countries, "non-recognition" of China and refusal to admit it to the United Nations are absurd and unjust. Even many prominent American social activists and authoritative newspapers have emphasized that the United States must "establish normal relations with Beijing."

Markov concluded by writing that 1954 should be the year for restoring the Chinese people's rights and their role in international affairs. The interests of peace demand this, and life demands this.

　　各国人民拥护召开五大国会议
　　“新时代”载文论中国在国际事务中的作用
    【新华社二十七日讯】　在资本主义国家里，越来越多的人们认识到只有中国参加才能解决重大国际问题。一个争取五大国协商的运动，正在这些国家里广泛展开。
    亚洲人民热烈要求五大国举行会议。在印度，全印和平理事会在一月间举行的会议上，通过了一项决议，希望在柏林四国外长会议之后，接着举行五大国会议。决议指出：没有中国参加，就不可能解决重大国际问题，尤其是与亚洲有关的问题。印度舆论普遍支持苏联提出的举行五大国会议的主张。勒克瑙出版的“新生活报”在一九五三年十月初曾发表社论指出：“今天在任何国际协商中，决不能对中华人民共和国置之不理。”
    在日本，一九五三年十二月中旬举行的日本人民和平大会，在宣言中着重指出了日本人民要求举行五大国会议。去年七八月间，日本各地广泛举行了“和平月”的活动，在房总半岛的千叶市、北海道的扎幌和其他各地举行的区域性和平集会上，日本人民都提出了要求举行五大国会议的口号。
    缅甸望濑市保卫世界和平委员会在一九五三年十一月望濑市佛节期间展开了要求五大国缔结和平公约的运动，三天内签名的有五千人。
    伊拉克首都巴格达一千五百多个劳动人民于一九五三年十月向五大国领袖提出呼吁书：表示巴格达不同政治和宗教信仰的劳动群众，拥护通过和平方法来缓和国际紧张局势的主张。
    在欧洲，由于人民的普遍愿望，甚至许多资产阶级政界人士和报刊也要求举行有中国参加的五大国会议。英国的“每日快报”在一月二十六日要求英国促进五大国会议的召开。它说：“远东问题的解决若没有中国参加是不可能的。”工党的“每日先驱报”也认为：“无限期地排斥中国，不仅是不明智的，而且是对和平的威胁。”英国三十个工党议员曾在一九五三年十一月二十六日向下院提出动议，要求英国政府建议举行五大国会议。
    在法国，在一九五三年七月十四日巴黎举行的纪念攻破巴士底狱的示威游行中，法国人民提出了要求立刻召开五大国会议的口号。法国舆论也反对美国统治集团想否认中国在国际事务中的作用的企图，连法国右翼资产阶级报纸“震旦报”也问道：“如果不听取中国的意见，人们能够严肃地谈论亚洲的和平吗？”“巴黎急进新闻”和“十字报”也赞成举行有中国参加的大国协商。
    意大利的罗马、都灵、佛罗伦萨、米兰等城市的人民在一九五三年十月曾举行了许多次大会和露天集会。意大利人民在这些集会上表示了要求承认中华人民共和国和争取缔结五大国和平公约的愿望。在米兰出版的资产阶级报纸“晚邮报”认为，承认中国是缓和国际紧张局势的先决条件。
    在美洲，加拿大、危地马拉等国都已展开了全国性的运动，号召人民支持举行五大国会议的主张。加拿大从一九五三年九月十二日起举行了全国公民投票，提出的问题是：“你赞成大国举行会议，以通过协商方式解决威胁世界和平的问题吗？”到一九五三年十一月底止已有三万四千人表示意见，其中有百分之九十八表示“赞成”。加拿大合作联盟领袖柯德威尔在一九五三年十一月魁北克合作联盟全省年会上发表的演说中，也要求召开五大国会议研究世界问题。危地马拉全国和平委员会在一九五三年年底，就已经为要求保卫国家主权与召开五大国会议的请愿书征集了五万一千多人的签名。
    【新华社二十六日讯】　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“新时代”杂志第四期刊载了马尔科夫所写的一篇文章，题目是“迫不及待的任务”。
    马尔科夫在谈到恢复中国人民的权利及其在国际事务中的作用时，着重指出：中华人民共和国拥有足够的力量担当起维持国际和平与安全的大国责任。
    作者指出，封锁政策已经破产了。在一九五三年中，封锁中国的政策的完全崩溃一次又一次地得到了证明。他说，奉行歧视政策的大部分资本主义国家由于丧失了中国这个大市场，遭到巨大损失。不管华盛顿怎样施加压力，也往往不管有没有正式的外交关系，资本主义阵营许多国家与中国的贸易关系还是在不断地扩大。
    马尔科夫详细谈到并驳斥了反对与中华人民共和国发展正常关系的那些人以及他们的“论据”。他接着写道，新中国的和平外交政策和它的巨大成就，引起了整个亚洲的欢欣鼓舞。在亚洲各国人民眼中看来，“不承认”中国和拒绝它加入联合国，这是荒谬的，也是非正义的。甚至许多著名的美国社会活动家、权威报纸都着重指出，美国必须“与北京建立正常的关系”。
    马尔科夫最后写道，一九五四年应该是恢复中国人民的权利及其在国际事务中的作用的一年。和平的利益这样要求，生活这样要求。
