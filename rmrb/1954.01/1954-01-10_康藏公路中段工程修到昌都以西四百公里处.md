    Kangzang Highway Middle Section Project
    Extended to 400 Kilometers West of Qamdo
    Xinhua News Agency: The middle section of the Kangzang Highway project, thanks to the efforts of the road-building workers, has been extended to 410 kilometers west of Qamdo, overfulfilling the 1953 road-building task by 53 days ahead of schedule. So far, the eastern and middle sections of the Kangzang Highway have a total length of 860 kilometers, and the front end of the highway is now pointing towards the Yarlung Tsangpo River basin.
    The 1953 construction plan for the middle section of the Kangzang Highway was to construct 400 kilometers of road in five phases, from mid-April to February 20, 1954. The entire line passes through four mountains with an altitude of more than 4,000 meters, four large rivers, and grassland and forest areas. Tens of thousands of military laborers and road construction workers, inspired by the large-scale economic construction of the motherland, accepted this task with full confidence.
    Road construction personnel demonstrated the spirit of patriotism and collectivism in their work. In order to improve project quality and work efficiency, military laborers and workers continued to carry out the "Engineering Democratic Technical Creation Movement," which increased the total average work efficiency of road construction to more than 150% of the standard work efficiency. Road construction workers also studied and applied advanced Soviet road construction experience and launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy. During the construction, Rang Mingde, Director of the Southwest Highway Engineering Bureau of the Central Ministry of Communications, and the person in charge of the road construction troops of the Tibet Military Region, lived on the construction site for a long time, providing specific leadership and participating in the work.
    The 1953 road construction project received active support from the Tibetan people. People from all walks of life in the Qamdo area organized a large-scale transportation team to transport tens of thousands of tons of grain and materials to the construction area on time, ensuring the supply of road construction personnel. Now, the road construction personnel are successively entering winter rest areas to carry out various preparations for the 1954 construction.

    康藏公路中段工程
    修到昌都以西四百公里处
    据新华社讯：康藏公路中段工程，在筑路职工的努力下，已修通到昌都以西四百一十公里处，提前五十三天超额完成了一九五三年度的筑路任务。至此，康藏公路东段和中段共修筑了八百六十公里里程，公路前端已指向雅鲁藏布江流域。
    康藏公路中段一九五三年度的修筑计划，是从四月半到一九五四年二月二十日的时间内，分五期施工，筑路四百公里。全线要经过四座海拔四千多公尺的大山，四条大河和草原、森林地带。数以万计的军工和筑路工人，受到祖国大规模经济建设的鼓舞，信心百倍地接受了这一任务。
    筑路人员在工作中，发挥了爱国主义和集体主义的精神。为了提高工程质量和工作效率，筑路军工和工人继续开展了“工程民主技术创造运动”，使筑路的总平均工作效率提高到标准工作效率的百分之一百五十以上。筑路职工还学习和应用了苏联先进的筑路经验，并展开了增产节约运动。在施工中，中央交通部西南公路工程局局长穰明德和西藏军区筑路部队的负责人，都长期住在工地上，具体领导和参加工作。
    一九五三年筑路工程，受到了藏族人民的积极支援。昌都地区藏族各阶层人士组织了规模巨大的运输队，将数万吨粮食物资按时运达工区，保证了筑路人员的供给。现在，筑路人员陆续进入冬季整休地区，为一九五四年施工进行各项准备工作。
