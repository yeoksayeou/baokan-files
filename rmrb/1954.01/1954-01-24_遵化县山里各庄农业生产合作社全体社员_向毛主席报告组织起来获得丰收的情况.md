To our respected Chairman Mao:

We responded to your call and, under the leadership of Party Branch Secretary Huang Jin, organized an agricultural producers' cooperative in the autumn of the year before last with eleven households. The entire cooperative had 190 mu of land, a total of fifteen laborers, two mules, one donkey, three iron carts, and one seven-inch walking plow. This basically solved the past difficulties of lacking livestock and farm tools. Because the land was managed uniformly, and everyone worked together, labor efficiency was greatly improved, and we achieved a bumper harvest that had never been seen before. The average yield per mu increased from 140-150 jin in the past to 405 jin. The total income of the entire cooperative was 76,800 jin of grain.

The main reason we were able to achieve such a bumper harvest was because the cooperative brought into play the advantages of "making the best use of people's talents" and "making the best use of the land." For example, when sowing was difficult due to the spring drought last year, all the cooperative's labor force was mobilized to use the method of borrowing moisture to rush planting; the last six mu of land without moisture were watered by manual carrying, mixed with manure and planted, and all the land was planted ten days earlier than individual households. When summer hoeing and autumn harvesting were busy and overwhelming, ten female laborers were mobilized to work in the fields, so that all the land was hoed three times and weeded three times. During the autumn harvest, a storm broke out (windy and rainy weather), and fourteen mu of sorghum that was about to ripen were saved from any loss under the rush harvest of all the cooperative members. Women contributed 415 labor days out of the 1,700 labor days for the whole year. Because the land was managed uniformly, we were able to plant suitable crops according to the soil quality, planting 30 mu of low-lying land with all white horse tooth corn, harvesting 18,000 jin, and achieving a high yield of an average of 600 jin per mu. With the bumper harvest of the cooperative, the lives of the members have also improved, and every household has surplus grain.

After studying the general line for the transition period of the country, all members of the cooperative realized that only by taking the socialist road and realizing national industrialization can we live a happy life of common prosperity. We sold all of our 25,100 jin of surplus grain to the state to support the country's industrial construction. At the end of last year, we absorbed seven new members and are determined to further improve our cooperative. After everyone's discussion, we formulated a plan requiring the cooperative's 270 mu of land to increase production by another 12,000 jin of grain this year, with an average yield per mu increasing by 45 jin compared to last year. In order to ensure the realization of the production increase plan, we decided to apply 5,000 jin of manure per mu of land and hoe it four times and weed it four times. The cooperative used the money from selling surplus grain to order 3,000 jin of fertilizer powder. The cooperative's public and household-raised pigs totaled thirty-nine, and by March of this year, they will be able to produce 390,000 jin of manure. The members also dug black mud and accumulated more than 50,000 jin of fertilizer; autumn fertilizer has already been sent to 120 mu of land. In addition, the cooperative also bought a rubber-tired cart and a horse, and is hauling stones in the winter, preparing to dig a stone well after the spring begins to turn eleven mu of dry land into paddy fields; the cooperative's three iron carts are hauling sand to pave low-lying land, preparing to improve the soil of 70 mu of land. We will fully exploit the production potential of the cooperative, actively increase the production of more grain, and strive for the early realization of national industrialization and socialism.

All members of the Shanligezhuang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, Zunhua County

### 遵化县山里各庄农业生产合作社全体社员  向毛主席报告组织起来获得丰收的情况

    遵化县山里各庄农业生产合作社全体社员
    向毛主席报告组织起来获得丰收的情况敬爱的毛主席：
    我们响应您的号召，在党支部书记黄进的领导下，前年秋后由十一户组织了一个农业生产合作社。全社一百九十亩地，共有十五个劳动力、两头骡子、一头驴和三辆铁车、一架七吋步犁。这就基本上解决了过去缺牲畜、少农具的困难。由于土地统一经营，大伙在一起干活，大大地提高了劳动效率，我们获得了从来未曾有过的大丰收，每亩平均产量由过去的一百四、五十斤提高到四百零五斤，全社总收入共折原粮七万六千八百斤。
    我们所以能够获得这样的丰收，主要是因为合作社发挥了“人尽其材”、“地尽其利”的优越性。如去年春旱时播种困难，社里全体劳动力出动用借墒抢种的方法播种；最后剩下了没有墒土的六亩地，就用人工担水浇地、拌粪点种，全部土地比单干户提前十天种完。夏锄、秋收活多忙不过来，发动了十名妇女劳动力下地干活，使全部土地都耪了三遍、耘了三遍。秋收时起了暴天（风雨交加的天气），十四亩快熟的高粱在全体社员抢收下没有遭到一点损失。全年一千七百个劳动日里，妇女们就作了四百一十五个。因为土地统一经营，我们就可以按土质播种适宜的庄稼，把三十亩洼地全种上白马牙玉米，收了一万八千斤，得到了每亩平均产六百斤的高额丰产。随着合作社的丰收，社员家生活也提高了，家家有了余粮。
    学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，全体社员认识到只有走社会主义的道路，实现国家工业化，才能过起大家富裕的幸福生活。我们把两万五千一百斤余粮全部卖给了国家，来支持国家的工业建设。我们在去年年末又吸收了七户新社员，并决心把我们的合作社进一步办好。经过大家讨论，我们订出计划，要求全社二百七十亩地今年再增产一万二千斤粮食，每亩平均产量比去年提高四十五斤。为了保证增产计划的实现，我们决定每亩地要施圈粪五千斤，做到耪四遍，耘四遍。社里用卖余粮的钱订购了三千斤肥田粉，社里公有的和各户养了三十九口肥猪，到今年三月能造出三十九万斤粪肥，社员们挖黑泥还能积肥五万余斤；现在已经有一百二十亩地的秋粪送到地里。此外，社里还买了一辆胶皮车和一匹马，在冬季拉石头，准备开春后打一眼石井，把十一亩旱地改为水田；社里的三辆铁车正在拉砂子铺洼地，准备改良七十亩地的土壤。我们要充分发掘合作社的生产潜力，积极增产更多的粮食，为国家工业化和社会主义的早日实现而努力。
