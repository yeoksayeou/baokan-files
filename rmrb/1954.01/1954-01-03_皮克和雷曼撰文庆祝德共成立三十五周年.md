Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: December 30, 1953, marked the 35th anniversary of the founding of the German Communist Party.

    On this day, the German democratic newspapers published an article by Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, entitled "The Historical Significance of the Founding of the German Communist Party." Pieck described in detail the struggles of the German Communist Party in various periods. He said: The imperialist path that Germany had taken from the time of the Hohenzollern dynasty to the time of the Hitler fascist dictatorship was a path that led the German people to ruin. Today, Adenauer, for the benefit of American and German imperialism, is attempting to remilitarize West Germany and drive the people into a third world war. In this situation, commemorating the founding of the German Communist Party has particularly important historical significance. The birth of the German Communist Party was the birth of the first and only political party in Germany that truly opposed imperialism and militarism, and thus truly defended the interests of the nation and the people.

    Pieck traced the historical process of the founding of the German Communist Party. He said: "The German Communist Party pointed out to the German working class the path to defeating the forces of war, and it was a party that struggled for the national future and peace of the German people. Monopoly capitalists, arms dealers, Junker landlords, and Prussian militarists regarded the Communist Party as a thorn in their side from very early on and always tried to eliminate it... However, the vitality of the revolutionary workers' movement is indestructible, and Marxism-Leninism is invincible." Pieck pointed out that now, in the German Democratic Republic, the Socialist Unity Party has become the leading party in the first worker-peasant state power in German history. At the same time, in West Germany, the German Communist Party is waging a resolute struggle against imperialism, against war, and against militarism, striving for the democratic unification of a truly peace-loving and independent Germany.

    The newspapers also devoted entire pages to publishing a commemorative article by Hermann Lehmann, Chairman of the German Communist Party. Lehmann said: "Despite all the setbacks, the development of the German Communist Party is a victorious development. In 1918, the party was only a small group, but later, under the leadership of Thälmann, it became a Marxist-Leninist party that united the broad masses, and thus achieved great success." After describing the development of the German Democratic Republic after the war, Lehmann continued: "In West Germany, imperialism and militarism, under American protection, have been revived from the land that was defeated in 1945. They have once again declared that they want to eliminate the German Communist Party. Hitler also thought he could eliminate us—the victorious Communist Party—but he did not succeed; it was Hitler fascism that was eliminated." He said: "After the September elections, the enemy thought that the German Communist Party seemed to be in an unimportant position. However, since then, they have had to worry about the policies of our party every day. The public enemies of our people not only hate the German Communist Party, but also fear the German Communist Party, because they know that the strength of our party lies in the fact that our party's program for the struggle for national unification is completely consistent with the interests of the working class and the entire people." Lehmann pointed out that today, among the broad masses of the West German people, the forces demanding peace and democracy, demanding all-German negotiations and East-West German rapprochement are developing. Finally, he emphasized the necessity of unifying the actions of the West German working class and further consolidating and strengthening the German Communist Party.

    皮克和雷曼撰文庆祝德共成立三十五周年
    【新华社柏林二日电】一九五三年十二月三十日是德国共产党成立三十五周年纪念日。
    这一天，德国民主报纸刊载了德国统一社会党主席皮克的题为“德国共产党成立的历史意义”的文章。皮克详细叙述了德国共产党在各个时期的斗争。他说：从霍亨索伦王朝时期起到希特勒法西斯独裁时期，德国所走过的帝国主义道路，乃是使德国人民走向毁灭的道路。今天，阿登纳为了美、德帝国主义的利益，企图使西德重新军国主义化，并企图驱使人民进行第三次世界大战。在这种情况下，纪念德国共产党的成立有着特别重大的历史意义。德国共产党的诞生，是德国第一个和唯一的一个真正反对帝国主义与军国主义从而也就是真正维护国家与民族利益的政党的诞生。
    皮克回溯了德国共产党建党的历史过程。他说：“德国共产党向德国工人阶级指出了战胜战争势力的道路，它是为了德国人民的民族前途与和平而斗争的政党。独占资本家、军火大王、容克地主和普鲁士军阀从很早起就把共产党看做是他们的眼中钉，并且一直设法消灭它……但是，革命的工人运动的生命力是不可摧毁的，马克思—列宁主义是不可战胜的。”皮克指出，现在，在德意志民主共和国，统一社会党已成为德国历史上第一个工农国家政权中的领导政党。同时，在西德的德国共产党正进行着反对帝国主义、反对战争和反对军国主义的坚决斗争，争取一个真正爱好和平与独立的德国的民主统一。
    各报也以整版的篇幅刊载了德国共产党主席雷曼的纪念文章。雷曼说：“尽管有一切的挫折，德国共产党的发展是一个胜利的发展。一九一八年，党还只是一个小的团体，后来在台尔曼领导下成为一个团结广大群众的马克思—列宁主义的政党，因而获得了伟大的成功。”在叙述了战后德意志民主共和国的发展以后，雷曼接着说：“在西德，帝国主义和军国主义在美国保护下，从一九四五年被打垮的土地上又复活了起来。他们又一次宣布想要消灭德国共产党。希特勒也曾经以为可以消灭我们——胜利的共产党，但是并没有成功，被消灭的却是希特勒法西斯主义”。他说：“九月选举以后，敌人以为德国共产党似乎已处于不重要的地位了。但是，从那时以来，他们每天都不得不因我们党的政策而担心。我国人民的公敌不仅仇恨德国共产党，而且害怕德国共产党，因为他们知道，我们党的力量在于我们党为民族统一而斗争的纲领与工人阶级和全体人民的利益完全一致。”雷曼指出，今天，西德广大人民中要求和平与民主、要求全德谈判和东西德接近的力量正在发展着。最后，他强调必须统一西德工人阶级的行动和进一步巩固与加强德国共产党。
