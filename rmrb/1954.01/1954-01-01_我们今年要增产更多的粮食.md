    We Will Increase Grain Production Even More This Year
    All Members of the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Shanxi

    Today, all of us members are celebrating the beginning of the second year of the motherland's planned economic construction with very happy feelings.

    Recently, all of us members have studied the general line for the state's transition period, raised our socialist ideological awareness, and sold more than one million jin of surplus grain to the state to support national industrial construction.

    We responded to Chairman Mao's call to "get organized." After organizing mutual aid teams in 1946, production increased year by year, and our lives improved day by day. On the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Socialist Revolution in October 1952, we united 918 households and established the "China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm," learning from the example of Soviet farmers, engaging in collective labor, and implementing the principle of distribution according to labor. With the help of the tractor station, all 14,000 mu of land in the village used machine耕作 [耕作 means "cultivation"] , and all of them achieved bumper harvests. The output in 1953 exceeded that in 1952 by 13.35 percent, exceeded the output of the best mutual aid team in the village by 25.7 percent, and exceeded that of individual farmers by 43.4 percent. We all received the labor remuneration we deserved. Each villager's household received 3,320 jin of autumn grain; the average income per villager was 737 jin of autumn grain. Why is there such a big change? In a word, it is mainly the result of taking the socialist road. Our farm uses tractors for cultivation. Two people drive a "Natzi" tractor and can cultivate 230 mu of land a day to a depth of six or seven inches, which is equivalent to the work of 92 people, 92 livestock, and 46 plows for a day. Using machines for cultivation saved us 100 laborers and the power of 200 livestock in the first year. Here, we personally experienced the greatness of our working-class brothers and the great help of the country to the peasants. Our grain production has increased, and our surplus grain has also increased. Therefore, in 1953, we were able to sell more than one million jin of surplus grain to the state to support national construction.

    We deeply feel that industry and agriculture are inseparable. In order to develop industry, we must also pay attention to developing agriculture at the same time in order to ensure the supply of grain and industrial raw materials to workers. However, our current production level is far from keeping up with the needs of the motherland's industrial construction. Therefore, our farm will continue to expand and absorb agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers from nearby villages (more than 200 households have actively requested to join the farm) to jointly take the socialist road. Everyone said: After joining the farm, future production will definitely be higher, and life will definitely be happier!

    Our farm has initially formulated a production plan for 1954. The entire village will strive to produce more than 4.1 million jin of grain, and the average yield per mu will increase from 244 jin in 1953 to 288 jin, an increase of 44 jin, striving for an even greater harvest. According to the 1954 plan, the entire village will be able to sell 1.5 million jin of surplus grain to the state to support national construction. Now, all of our members have enthusiastically launched a production campaign and have accumulated more than 200,000 dan of fertilizer. In order to ensure the further development of our farm, in 1954, we must continue to study the general line and improve our socialist ideological awareness. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, all of us members must increase production again and again, sell more surplus grain to the state, support national construction, and realize the socialist industrialization of the country as soon as possible. At that time, the vast number of farmers will be able to use machines to cultivate the land, use machines to harvest, carry out large-scale production, and life will become happier and more fulfilling day by day.

    我们今年要增产更多的粮食
    山西中苏友好集体农庄全体庄员
    今天，我们全体庄员怀着非常愉快的心情，来庆祝祖国有计划经济建设的第二年的开始。
    我们全体庄员，最近学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，提高了社会主义思想觉悟，全庄把一百多万斤余粮卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。
    我们响应毛主席“组织起来”的号召，从一九四六年开始组织互助组后，生产一年比一年高，生活一天比一天好。一九五二年十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日，我们九百一十八户联合起来，成立了“中苏友好集体农庄”，学习苏联农民的榜样，集体劳动，实行了按劳取酬的分配原则。我们在拖拉机站的帮助下，全庄有一万四千亩土地使用了机器耕作，结果都获得了丰收。一九五三年的产量超过一九五二年百分之十三点三五，超过所在村最好的互助组的产量百分之二十五点七，超过个体农民百分之四十三点四。我们都得到了应得的劳动报酬，每户庄员实收秋粮三千三百二十斤；庄员每人平均收入七百三十七斤秋粮。为什么会有这样大的变化呢？一句话，主要是走社会主义道路的结果。我们农庄使用拖拉机耕作，两个人驾一辆“纳齐号”拖拉机，一天能耕二百三十亩土地，深达六七寸，顶九十二个人、九十二头牲口、四十六付犁一天干的活。用机器耕作，头一年就省下我们一百个劳动力和二百头牲口的力量。在这里，我们亲身体验到了工人老大哥的伟大和国家对农民的巨大帮助。我们的粮食产量提高了，余粮也就增加了，所以，一九五三年我们能够把一百多万斤余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设。
    我们深深感到，工业和农业是分不开的。为了发展工业，就必须同时注意发展农业，才能保证供给工人粮食和工业原料。但是，我们现在的生产水平，还远远赶不上祖国工业建设的需要。因此，我们的农庄还要继续扩大，吸收附近村的农业生产合作社，互助组和个体农民参加（他们已共有二百多户积极要求参加农庄），共同走社会主义的道路。大家都说：入了农庄，今后的生产一定会更提高，生活一定会更幸福！
    我们农庄已初步订出了一九五四年的生产计划。全庄要为生产四百一十多万斤粮食而努力，每亩平均产量要从一九五三年二百四十四斤提高到二百八十八斤，即增产四十四斤，争取更大的丰收。一九五四年计划，全庄能有一百五十万斤余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设。现在，我们全体庄员都已热烈地展开了生产运动，已积肥料二十多万担。为了保证我们农庄更进一步的向前发展，一九五四年中，我们要继续学习总路线，提高我们的社会主义思想觉悟。我们全体庄员要在共产党和毛主席的领导下，增产再增产，把更多的余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设，使国家社会主义工业化早日实现。到那时候，广大农民就能使用机器耕地，使用机器收割，进行大规模生产了，生活就会一天比一天更加幸福和更加美满。
