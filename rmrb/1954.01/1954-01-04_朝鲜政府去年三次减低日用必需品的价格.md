In March, the prices of more than fifty items were reduced, in July, thirty items, and in December, another thirty items. The prices of shoes and food, especially meat products, were reduced particularly significantly.

The reduction of state prices has greatly led to a decrease in market prices. According to statistics from the Pyongyang Municipal Statistics Bureau, if the market price on May 1, 1952, is taken as 100, then the market price on May 1, 1953, is 67, and the market price on December 1, 1953, is 43.

    朝鲜政府去年三次减低日用必需品的价格
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社平壤一日讯：朝鲜中央通讯社报道：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为了改善人民生活，在一九五三年一年中曾一再减低物价。重要日用必需品的价格一共减低了三次——三月、七月和十二月。在三月间，一共减低了五十多种物品的价格，七月间是三十种，十二月间又是三十种。减得特别多的是鞋类、食品、特别是肉类制品的价格。
    国家价格的减低，已大大地引起了市场价格的降低。根据平壤市统计局的数字，如果把一九五二年五月一日的市场价格作为一百，那么，一九五三年五月一日的市场价格是六十七，一九五三年十二月一日的市场价格是四十三。
