    Do a Good Job in Railway Passenger Transport During the Spring Festival

    The Spring Festival of 1954 is approaching, and a passenger transport peak is already facing the transportation departments, especially the operating railway departments. To meet the needs of passengers as much as possible, so that passengers can happily return home for the festival and return to their jobs on time, has become an important task in the current railway transportation work.

    The surge in the number of passengers during the Spring Festival is a common practice in previous years. During the ten days before the Spring Festival in 1953, Beijing Station transported 168,982 people, with the highest number of passengers reaching 19,270 per day, an increase of about one time compared to normal times. Shenyang transported 281,627 people, with the highest number of passengers reaching 50,275 per day, an increase of 2.4 times compared to normal times. Shanghai Station transported 303,591 people, with the highest number of passengers reaching 53,694 per day, an increase of 2.77 times compared to normal times. With the development of national economic construction, the increase of population in cities, industrial and mining areas, and the general improvement of people's living standards, the number of passengers returning home for the festival may be even greater than in previous years this Spring Festival. Therefore, doing a good job in passenger transport this Spring Festival is even more important.

    At present, the throughput capacity of the main line sections of China's operating railways lags behind transportation needs, and the number of locomotives and vehicles is also insufficient. It is difficult to fully meet the passenger requirements during the Spring Festival, but this does not mean that there is no way to improve. During the Spring Festival in 1953, the congestion and chaos in passenger transport in some areas were due, in part, to the railway department's lack of accurate plans in advance. The railway department can completely improve its transportation capacity during the Spring Festival by improving its own work. To this end, the Central Ministry of Railways has instructed all railway administrations to mobilize all manpower and material resources for transporting passengers to complete the Spring Festival passenger transport task. All railway administrations have also established temporary institutions and started various preparations. Now, the most important thing for railway transportation departments in various regions is to strengthen planning and quickly conduct passenger flow surveys, and compile transportation plans based on reliable passenger flow data. Because if passenger flow is not investigated, and the number of passengers and their destinations are not grasped, it will not be known how many passengers will take the train, it will not be known where the passengers are going, and it will be impossible to compile transportation plans that meet actual needs, and the result will inevitably be a rush. To do a good job in this survey work, it is necessary to closely contact various agencies, schools, factories, mines, enterprises, and mass organizations, and require staff, workers, students, shop assistants, etc. to organize themselves to take the train, and submit travel plans as soon as possible to strive for balanced transportation. Secondly, it is necessary to reduce passenger concentration. At present, the railway transportation capacity is limited. If passengers concentrate on taking the train during the same period, it will greatly exceed the railway transportation capacity. Therefore, it is necessary to disperse the passenger's travel dates and reduce the concentration. Again, passengers with the same destination can be organized to run direct trains, and long-distance passengers can be organized to take long-distance trains, and short-distance passengers can take short-distance trains, so as to give full play to the effectiveness of passenger car transportation, and partial fence cars can be used instead of short-distance passenger cars to solve the shortage of vehicles.

    Local party committees, people's governments, and social organizations should vigorously assist the railway transportation department in doing a good job in Spring Festival passenger transport, help the railway department investigate passenger flow, and organize balanced transportation. The Shanghai Municipal Committee convened a meeting presided over by the East China Finance Committee, and under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, established a Spring Festival Homecoming Work Committee to uniformly lead the Spring Festival transportation work in the Shanghai area. The Beijing Municipal Finance Committee also convened 47 units to discuss and propose travel plans. These measures are necessary, and major cities along the railway line should take similar measures.

    Workers and cadres who can stay during the Spring Festival should preferably not return home. This not only reduces railway congestion, but more importantly, ensures the attendance rate before and after the Spring Festival. Passengers who must return home for the festival should also understand the difficulties on the railway and assist the station in maintaining good order. Passengers should try to understand and support the railway transportation department's arrangements for group passenger travel dates, organization of long-distance passengers to take long-distance trains, and the use of fence cars instead of passenger cars.

### 做好春节期间铁路客运工作

    做好春节期间铁路客运工作
    一九五四年的春节快到了，一个客运高潮，已摆在交通运输部门，特别是营业铁路部门的面前。尽可能地满足旅客的要求，使旅客高高兴兴地还乡过节，又按时回到工作岗位，就成为当前铁路运输工作中一个重要任务。
    春节期间旅客数量激增，是历年来的惯例。一九五三年春节前十天北京车站运送了十六万八千九百八十二人，最高一天乘车人数达一万九千二百七十人，较平时约增加一倍。沈阳运送了二十八万一千六百二十七人，最高一天乘车人数达五万零二百七十五人，较平时增加二点四倍。上海站运送了三十万三千五百九十一人，最高一天乘车人数达五万三千六百九十四人，较平时增加二点七七倍。今年春节随着国家经济建设的发展，城市、工矿区人口增加，人民生活普遍得到改善，还乡过节的旅客可能更较往年增多。因此，做好今年春节旅客运输工作，就更其重要了。
    目前，我国营业铁路主要干线区段的通过能力是落后于运输需要的，机车、车辆的数量也感不足，完全满足春节期间的旅客要求是很困难的，但这并不等于就没有任何改善办法。一九五三年春节期间，某些地区客运的拥挤和混乱现象，其原因之一就在于铁路部门事先缺乏准确的计划。而铁路部门是完全可以从改进自己的工作中，来提高春节期间的运输能力的。为此，中央铁道部已指示各铁路管理局动员所有运送旅客的人力物力，完成春节客运任务。各铁路管理局也已建立了临时机构，并着手进行各项准备工作。现在各地铁路运输部门，首先要抓紧的是加强计划性，迅速做好客流调查工作，根据可靠的客流资料编制运输计划。因为如果不调查客流，不掌握乘车旅客人数及其去向，就不知道会有多少旅客乘车，就不知道旅客往那里去，就无法编制切合实际需要的运输计划，其结果必然是手忙脚乱。要做好这项调查工作，就应该密切与各机关、学校、厂矿、企业、群众团体取得联系，要求工作人员，工人、学生、店员等组织起来乘车，并早日提出乘车计划，争取平衡运输。其次要减少旅客集结密度，目前铁路运输能力是有一定限度的，如果旅客集中在同一时期乘车，将大大地超过铁路运输能力，因此就必须分散旅客的乘车日期，减少集结密度。再次，可以将到站相同的旅客组织起来开行直达车，并组织长途旅客乘长途车，短途旅客乘短途车，以充分发挥客车运送效力，并可以部分栅车代替短途客车，解决车辆不足的困难。
    各地党、人民政府及社会团体应大力协助铁路运输部门做好春节客运工作，帮助铁路部门调查客流，组织平衡运输。上海市由华东财委主持召开了会议，并在上海市委领导下，成立了春节还乡工作委员会，统一领导上海地区的春节运输工作。北京市财委也召集了四十七个单位开会讨论提出乘车计划。这些措施都是必要的，沿铁路线各大城市都应采取类似的措施。
    春节期间可以不还乡的工人、干部，最好不还乡。这不仅是减少铁路的拥挤，更重要的是保证春节前后的出勤率。必须还乡过节的旅客也应体谅铁路上的困难，协助车站保持良好秩序，在铁路运输部门安排团体旅客乘车日期，组织长途旅客乘长途车及以栅车代替客车等措施方面，旅客应尽量加以谅解和支持。
