Xinhua News Agency, December 31st. The China Peace Committee sent a cable to Marshal Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean people, and the Korean People's Army, congratulating them on the New Year. The text of the cable is as follows:

Respected Marshal Kim Il-sung and the heroic Korean people and Korean People's Army: On the occasion of New Year's Day 1954, the China Peace Committee, on behalf of the peace-loving Chinese people, extends warm fraternal congratulations to you and the heroic Korean people and Korean People's Army under your leadership.

In the past year, the Chinese and Korean people have won a great victory in the war against American aggressors and in defending the independence and security of their countries, and have achieved the armistice in Korea. Now, the Korean people are rapidly beginning the arduous task of restoring and developing the national economy with a heroic attitude. The Chinese people will continue to fully support your restoration and construction work, just as they did during the war, and will continue to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and jointly strive for the complete realization of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the early convening of a political conference, and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

We wish that the militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples will be forever consolidated and developed, that the Korean people will achieve greater success in restoring and developing the national economy, and that the Chinese and Korean people will achieve more brilliant victories in the common cause of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.
