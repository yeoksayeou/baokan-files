    The winter of last year marked the first time in history that northern Jiangsu Province, north of the Yangtze River, began to control winter water sources according to the needs of navigation and irrigation, fully leveraging the achievements and effects of four years of water conservancy construction. Currently, the water levels of important waterways such as the Grand Canal, the Chuanchang River, and the Tongyang Canal in northern Jiangsu Province have risen from less than one meter to over 1.8 meters. Ships with a carrying capacity of 60 tons can travel directly from the Yangtze River to the Grand Canal Station on the Longhai Railway via the canal, facilitating the exchange of goods between the north and south of the Yangtze River and reducing commodity circulation costs. The state-owned inland shipping company saves 1 billion yuan per month in expenses from transporting goods through the canal because it eliminates the need for transshipment. The vast rice-producing areas north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province can also receive timely supplies of irrigation water. It is estimated that even if it does not rain for 40 days during the rice transplanting season this year, there will still be water for irrigation.

    After the autumn harvest last year, the northern Jiangsu Province utilized the newly built Sanhe Sluice to systematically control the water volume of Hongze Lake. In addition to releasing water from Hongze Lake to the General Irrigation Canal and then into the Li Canal to maintain canal navigation, the water from the Grand Canal and the General Irrigation Canal flows through culverts and sluices into vast areas in Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Yancheng, Jianhu, and other counties that require irrigation water. North of Qingjiang City, the Zaoge River Control Gate, Liu Lao Jian Gate, and other structures were also controlled to reduce the flow into the sea and maintain navigation on the central Grand Canal north of Qingjiang City and south of the Longhai Railway.

    Before liberation, the northern Jiangsu region was long threatened by floods during the summer and autumn seasons. During the winter and spring seasons, the river water flowed into the Yangtze River and the Yellow Sea without any control, causing difficulties for navigation. Irrigation water was scarce during the rice transplanting season, and farmers often engaged in armed conflicts over water for irrigation. In the four years since liberation, the people of northern Jiangsu Province have actively engaged in water conservancy construction and participated in the Huai River management efforts. They have successively renovated the Hongze Lake Dam and the Grand Canal Dam, excavated the General Irrigation Canal, and built the Gaoliangjian Intake Sluice, the Yun Dong Diversion Sluice, the Yunxi Control Sluice, and the massive Sanhe Sluice that controls Hongze Lake. As a result, since last winter, they have been able to effectively control water sources and regulate water volume, creating favorable conditions for the development of agricultural production in the northern Jiangsu region.

    四年来的水利建设发挥显著作用
    苏北地区开始按航运和灌溉需要控制水源
    去年冬季江苏省长江以北地区开始历史上第一次按照航运和灌溉需要控制冬季水源，充分发挥四年来水利建设的成就和作用。现在江苏省长江以北的运河、串场河、通扬运河等重要航道的水位，都由不足一公尺升高到一点八公尺以上。载重六十吨的船只，可以从长江经运河直达陇海路运河车站，便利了长江南北的物资交流，减低了商品流转费用。国营内河轮船公司从运河运输物资因不需要翻载，一个月即可节省开支十亿元。江苏省长江以北广大的水稻产区，灌溉用水也可得到及时供应。预计今年插秧季节，即使四十天不雨也可以有水灌溉。
    江苏省长江以北地区去年秋收后，就利用刚建成的三河闸，有计划地控制洪泽湖的水量。除从洪泽湖放水到灌溉总渠再入里运河维持运河航运外，运河和灌溉总渠的水通过涵闸再流入高邮、宝应、兴化、盐城、建湖等县广大需水灌溉的地区。在清江市以北，又控制了皂河节制闸、刘老涧闸等，减少入海流量，保持清江市以北陇海路以南的中运河航运交通。
    江苏省长江以北地区在解放前，历年夏秋两季长期受着洪水的威胁，到冬春两季河道的水又毫无拦束地流向长江和黄海，航运发生困难；插秧季节灌溉缺水，农民常因争水灌溉发生械斗。解放四年来，江苏省长江以北地区的人民积极兴修水利和努力参加治淮，先后整修了洪泽湖大堤，运河大堤，开挖了灌溉总渠，建筑了高良涧进水闸、运东分水闸、运西节制闸以及控制洪泽湖的巨大的三河闸，因此从去冬起，就能有效地控制水源、调节水量，为发展苏北地区农业生产创造了有利的条件。
