    DALIAN (From Our Correspondent) - Last December 27th, worker representatives from the Dalian Chemical Plant and the Dalian Textile Mill visited the farmers of Nanguanling Town.
    The farmers of Nanguanling Town were very excited to hear the news of the workers' visit. Early in the morning, they crowded the streets, and the deafening sounds of gongs and drums and trumpets resounded everywhere. At about nine o'clock, the workers' visiting team arrived in Nanguanling Town in a float. The welcoming crowd surged forward, workers and farmers shook hands tightly, and exchanged greetings.
    The farmers of Nanguanling Town took the workers to the cultural station to rest for a while, and then held a welcoming meeting. At the meeting, the town leader, Yu Weixin, on behalf of all the farmers in the town, expressed a warm welcome to the workers' visiting team. He said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the help of our worker brothers, the farmers of our Nanguanling Town have been living a good life, and our grain harvest is increasing year by year. In 1950, the average grain yield per mu in the town was 140 jin, but this year (referring to 1953), our worker brothers have supplied us with new farm tools, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, etc. Although the rainfall was uneven, the average yield per mu was 250 jin. If we want to live like the Soviet farmers, we cannot do without the development of industry. In order to support the national industrialization, we have sold 30,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. In the future, we must develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations, produce more grain, and increase vegetable production to support national industrial construction!"
    At the meeting, the leader of the workers' visiting team, Hu Wenjie, gave a report on the general line and general task of the country during the transition period. Ge Chenggang, production team leader of the First Workshop of the Dalian Chemical Plant, Ding Jinyun, a worker from the spinning workshop of the Dalian Textile Mill, and Li Xiugui, deputy director of the Nanguanling Town Agricultural Production Cooperative, also spoke successively. In their speeches, they reported on their production achievements and used vivid facts to illustrate that the development of industrial production must have the support of agriculture, and the development of agricultural production cannot be separated from the help of industry. Textile worker Ding Jinyun said: "I see that many of the clothes worn by the farmers are woven by our factory, and the cotton used for weaving cloth is produced by the farmers, so we must further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance." Li Xiugui, deputy director of the agricultural production cooperative, said: "Our cooperative consists of 17 households and cultivates 249 mu of land this year. With the support of our worker brothers, all kinds of crops have a bumper harvest. Take the more than 90 mu of corn we planted, we planned to produce five dou of grain per mu; after using ammonium sulfate, the average yield per mu was more than seven dou and one sheng. With more grain, the lives of cooperative members are even better."
    At the meeting, workers and farmers also exchanged gifts. The Dalian Chemical Plant gave the newly trial-produced ammonium chloride to the farmers for trial use in Nanguanling Town. The Dalian Textile Mill gave the farmers two kinds of gifts: one was good yarn spun from good cotton and good cloth woven from it, and the other was coarse yarn spun from bad cotton and coarse cloth woven from it. The workers told the farmers: "You will know when you see these two kinds of cloth. If you want to wear beautiful clothes, you must produce more good cotton!" The farmers also gave the workers various vegetables and corn they produced. They said: "When you see these things, you will remember that to produce more grain, we rely on your support, relying on you to produce more chemical fertilizers and new farm tools."
    In the afternoon, the workers' visiting team divided into two groups and visited the members of the Lu Maojia Production Cooperative and the members of the Lu Zhengyang Mutual Aid Group. They talked happily about production and life, and made demands of each other. Yin Naizhong, a member of the Lu Zhengyang Mutual Aid Group, asked the workers: The quantity of ammonium sulfate produced by the workers now still cannot meet the needs of the farmers. He hopes that the workers will actively find ways to tap potential after returning to the factory to produce more chemical fertilizers, and hopes to produce better and cheaper new farm tools and cloth. After hearing this request, the chemical plant workers said that they would definitely bring this request back and give full play to the creative spirit of the workers to meet the needs of the farmers. Li Shufang, a female worker from the Second Group of the spinning workshop of the Dalian Textile Mill, said that she would improve product quality after returning to the factory, and spin better yarn and weave stronger cloth for the farmers. She also asked the farmers to work hard to improve farming techniques and produce more and better cotton so that there would be fewer waste products and more wealth would be created for the country.
    In order to establish close ties, workers and farmers left each other's mailing addresses. Everyone said that they would work together to build socialism under the brilliant light of the general line!

### 大连化学厂和纺织厂工人访问附近农民

    大连化学厂和纺织厂工人访问附近农民
    【本报讯】去年十二月二十七日，大连化学厂和大连纺织厂的工人代表，访问了南关岭镇的农民。
    南关岭镇农民听到工人来访的消息非常兴奋，一清晨就拥挤在街头上，到处响起震耳的锣鼓声和喇叭声。九时许，工人访问队坐着一辆花车，来到了南关岭镇。欢迎的人们一拥而上，工人农民紧紧地握手，互相问候。
    南关岭镇的农民把工人们接到文化站休息了一会，接着便举行了欢迎大会。会上镇长于维新代表全镇农民对工人访问队的到来表示热烈的欢迎。他说：“我们南关岭镇的农民，在共产党的领导下，在工人老大哥的帮助下，家家户户都过上了好日子，粮食一年比一年打的多。一九五○年全镇平均一亩产粮食一百四十斤，而今年（指一九五三年），工人老大哥供给了我们新式农具、化学肥料和农药等，虽然雨水不调，但是一亩地也平均收了二百五十斤粮食。我们要想把日子过得像苏联农民一样，离开工业的发展是不行的，为了支援国家工业化，我们已把三万斤余粮卖给了国家。今后，我们要发展互助合作组织，多打粮食，多增产蔬菜，支援国家工业建设！”
    会上工人访问队队长胡文杰做了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的报告。大连化学厂第一车间生产小组长葛成刚、大连纺织厂细纱车间工人丁金云和南关岭镇农业生产合作社副主任李秀贵等都先后讲了话。他们在讲话中，都报告了自己的生产成绩，并用生动的事实，说明了工业生产的发展必须有农业的支援，农业生产的发展离不开工业的帮助。纺纱工人丁金云说：“我看到农民身上穿的布很多都是我们工厂织出来的，而我们织布用的棉花又是农民生产出来的，所以必须进一步巩固工农联盟。”农业生产合作社副主任李秀贵说：“我们合作社是十七户组成的，今年种了二百四十九亩地。在工人老大哥的支援下，各种作物都丰收了。拿种的九十余亩玉米来说，我们计划一亩地产五斗粮食；用了硫铵以后，一亩地平均产了七斗一升还多。粮食打的多，社员生活就更好了。”
    会上，工人和农民还互相赠送了礼品。大连化学厂把新试制的氯化铔送给农民，请南关岭镇农民试用。大连纺织厂送给农民两种礼品：一种是好棉花纺出的好线和织出的好布，一种是坏棉花纺出的粗线和织出的粗布。工人们告诉农民说：“你们看看这两样布就知道了，要穿漂亮衣服，就得多生产好棉花呀！”农民也把他们生产出的各种蔬菜、玉米，赠送给工人。他们说：“看到这些东西，你们就记住了，要多打粮食，就靠你们支援，靠你们多生产化学肥料和新式农具。”
    午后，工人访问队分成两组，访问了卢茂家生产合作社的社员们和卢正阳互助组的组员们。他们畅快地谈到了生产，又谈到了生活，并相互提出了要求。卢正阳互助组员尹乃忠向工人们提出：现在工人生产的硫铵在数量上还满足不了农民的要求，希望工人回厂后积极找窍门、挖潜力，生产出更多的化学肥料，并希望生产出更好、更便宜的新式农具和布匹。化学厂工人听到这样的要求后，表示：一定把这个要求带回去，发挥工人们的创造精神，来满足农民的要求。大连纺织厂细纱车间第二小组女工李淑芳表示：回厂后要提高产品质量，为农民纺出更好的纱，织出更结实的布。她并要求农民努力改进耕作技术，生产出更多更好的棉花，这样就可少出废品，为国家创造更多的财富。
    为了建立起密切的联系，工人和农民互相留下通讯地址。大家都表示：要在总路线的光辉照耀下，为建设社会主义共同奋斗！
