    Yanggao County, Shanxi Province Achieves Success in Coordinating Grain Purchase Propaganda with the General Line; Peasants' Enthusiasm for Production and Mutual Aid and Cooperation are Significantly Enhanced

    Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, vigorously promoted the Party's general line for the transition period to the peasantry in conjunction with grain purchasing work, thereby enhancing the peasants' enthusiasm for production and their active participation in mutual aid and cooperation. This also resulted in significant changes in villages where work had previously lagged behind.

    Currently, approximately 80% of the population in Yanggao County has received education on the general line. The peasants warmly support the general line. Some peasants composed a song saying: "The Party's general line is a 'path to prosperity'; those who follow it will gradually improve their lives; those who go against it will have a hard time." The broad masses of peasants are actively selling their surplus grain to the state, expanding production, and participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the county sold more than twice as much means of production in December of last year than originally planned. In Jinjiazhuang and a few other villages alone, more than 20 head of draft animals were purchased. In Chenjiabao, Beixutun and other townships, more than 90 mu of soil were improved with sand, and more than 3,000 large carts of fertilizer were accumulated in just over 20 days. In the past, peasants in Jinjiazhuang rarely delivered manure to the fields in winter, but recently all 24 large carts in the village were mobilized and have now delivered all the manure. They are also actively depositing spring plowing production funds in the state bank. According to incomplete statistics, in the ten days or so at the end of December last year, the peasants in the county had already deposited more than 540 million yuan. At present, more than 300 mutual aid teams throughout the county have requested to be transformed into agricultural producers' cooperatives, and more than 1,500 households have requested to join the cooperatives. A small number of farmers who had originally planned to withdraw from the cooperatives expressed after studying the general line: "We will resolutely stay in the cooperative and cooperate to the end." More than 3,000 individual farming households throughout the county are actively requesting to join mutual aid teams, and more than 20 temporary mutual aid teams in Jinjiazhuang are preparing to become year-round mutual aid teams.

    After the propaganda of the general line, 21 villages throughout the county where work had previously lagged behind have been transformed. For example, Xizhongdian Village used to be the most backward village in the county, with not even one mutual aid team. After this education on the general line, the peasants have been clamoring to "organize themselves." According to incomplete statistics, more than 60 households are currently considering forming mutual aid teams. Dongxiao Village used to be unable to complete any tasks, and ten of the 26 Communist Party members in the village were not playing their roles. Now, they have all become active, and the entire village has overfulfilled its grain purchase task. Da'antan Village was also a backward village in the past. In this grain purchase work, it jumped to become a model village and was commended by the county Party committee. Some peasants said: "In the past, no one could push our backward village, but now the general line has illuminated our hearts, and our backward village has also become a model village!"

    山西省阳高县配合购粮宣传总路线有成绩
    农民生产热情和互助合作积极性显著提高
    山西省阳高县配合购粮工作大张旗鼓地向农民宣传国家过渡时期的总路线，提高了农民的生产热情和互助合作的积极性，并使过去工作比较落后的村庄有了很大转变。
    阳高全县目前已有约百分之八十的人口受到了总路线的教育。农民们热烈拥护总路线，有的农民编歌说：“党的总路线，是条‘大富’道，谁们跟着跑，生活慢慢好；谁们违背它，光景过不好。”广大农民踊跃把余粮卖给国家，并积极扩大生产，参加互助合作组织。全县供销合作社去年十二月份卖出的生产资料，超过原订计划一倍多。仅金家庄等几个村，就买了耕畜二十余头。陈家堡、北徐屯等乡，在二十多天内填砂改良土壤九十余亩，积肥三千余大车。金家庄农民往年很少在冬季往地里送粪，最近全村二十四辆大车全部出动，已把粪全部送完。向国家银行储蓄春耕生产资金的也很踊跃，据不完全统计，去年十二月底十余天内，全县农民已存款五亿四千多万元。目前，全县共有三百多个互助组要求转为农业生产合作社，要求入社的有一千五百多户。少数原来准备退社的农户，学习总路线后表示：“坚决在社，合作到底。”全县已有三千多户单干农户积极要求参加互助组，金家庄有二十多个临时互助组准备转为常年互助组。
    经过总路线宣传，全县有二十一个过去工作落后的村庄变了样。如西中佃村过去是全县最落后的村庄，一个互助组也没有，经过此次总路线教育，农民纷纷要求“组织起来”，据不完全统计，已有六十余户正在酝酿成立互助组。东小村过去什么任务也完不成，全村二十六个共产党员就有十个不起作用，现在都已积极起来，全村超额完成了购粮任务。大安滩村过去也是一个落后村，这次购粮工作中，一跃而为模范村，受到了县委的通报表扬。有的农民说：“过去谁也推不动咱们落后村，如今总路线照亮了咱们的心，落后村也变成模范村了！”
