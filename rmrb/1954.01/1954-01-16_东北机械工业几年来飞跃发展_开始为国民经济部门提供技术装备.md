The Northeast mechanical industry has achieved rapid development in recent years, changing its past incomplete and backward state and beginning to provide considerable technical equipment to various sectors of China's national economy. Considering the proportion of mechanical industrial output value in the total industrial output value: it was only 8 percent in 1949, 9.8 percent in 1950, 11.9 percent in 1951, and reached 13.7 percent in 1952, with continued growth in 1953. The proportion of state-owned mechanical industry in the entire mechanical industry of the region increased from 47 percent in 1949 to 76 percent in 1952. Through processing orders and other means, private mechanical industry has also gradually been incorporated into the national plan.

From the perspective of machine tools: there were no factories specializing in the production of machine tools during the puppet Manchukuo period. Some factories produced a few insignificant machine tools as an adjunct, and these were also light and simple in structure. Now, some machine tool factories in the Northeast are entirely producing modern machine tools to Soviet specifications. In 1953 alone, large and precision products successfully trial-produced included the Soviet-style 1Д63 lathe, 1Д65 lathe, 6Н82 universal milling machine, 255 radial drilling machine, 5-ton steam hammer, and gantry shearing machine.

In recent years, a large amount of equipment produced by Northeast mechanical factories with the help of advanced Soviet technology has strongly supported various sectors of the national economy such as geological exploration, fuel, metallurgy, transportation, and agriculture. For example, the Soviet B-3 type 1,000-meter drilling rig, with a drilling stroke of 1,300 meters, can be used for deep exploration; the 2100 cone crusher, the largest type of crusher in the Soviet Union, can crush 800 tons of ore per hour, providing new technical guarantees for the development of non-ferrous and ferrous metal industries; the 20,000 kVA 40,000-volt giant transformer can independently transform various voltages, with an efficiency sufficient for lighting a city of one million people; a complete set of 6,000 kilowatt hydro-turbine generators not only promptly supplied a certain water conservancy project and provided electricity for industry and agriculture, but also provided favorable technical conditions for manufacturing 10,000 kilowatt hydro-power equipment in 1954. The 24-row tractor-drawn seeder, with a row spacing of 150 cm, can sow two hectares per hour, and with wide sowing and dense planting, meets the requirements for high yield, which has a significant effect on the socialist transformation of agriculture. Northeast mechanical products not only supported Anshan Iron and Steel Complex (Anshan Steel), and the entire Northeast, but also supported the whole country. From Henan Machinery Factory, Beijing New Jing Iron Factory to Yunnan Kunming Tin Company, from Xinjiang, Guangzhou to Hainan Island, there are a large number of machine tools produced in Northeast China running rapidly.

In recent years, the variety and scope of new mechanical products in the Northeast have also gradually expanded. For example, taking 1949 as 100, it was 205 in 1950, 381 in 1951, and 530 in 1952. In the first year of the motherland's Five-Year Plan, Northeast mechanical factories not only completed the state's new product plan, but also overfulfilled 416 new products in order to further support key projects such as Anshan Steel, making the annual new product variety equal to ten and a half times that of 1949.

    东北机械工业几年来飞跃发展
    开始为国民经济部门提供技术装备
    东北机械工业几年来获得飞跃发展，改变了过去残缺的、落后的状态，开始为我国国民经济各部门提供相当强大的技术装备。以机械工业产值在全部工业中的比重来看：一九四九年仅为百分之八，一九五○年为百分之九点八，一九五一年为十一点九，一九五二年则达到十三点七，一九五三年续有增长。国营机械工业在全区整个机械工业中的比重，一九五二年已由一九四九年的百分之四十七增长到百分之七十六。私营机械工业通过加工订货等方式，也逐渐纳入了国家计划的轨道。
    从工作母机来看：伪满时没有专生产工作母机的工厂，某些工厂附带生产出一些为数微不足道的工作母机，也是轻型的、构造简单的产品。现在，东北一些机床厂全部生产着苏联规格的现代化母机。仅一九五三年试制成功的大型、精密产品即有苏联式一Д六三车床、一Д六五车床、六Н八二万能铣床、二五五摇臂钻床、五吨蒸气锤、龙门剪床等。
    几年来，东北机械工厂在苏联先进技术的帮助下生产的大量设备，有力地支援了地质探测、燃料、冶金、交通运输、农业等国民经济各个部门。如苏联B—3型一千米钻探机，钻探行程一千三百米，可供深部探矿之用；二一○○圆锥破碎机，是苏联破碎机械中最大的一种，每小时可破碎矿石八百吨，对有色金属和黑色金属工业的发展提供了新的技术保证；二万千伏安四万伏巨型变压器，可以独立变各种电压，效能足供一百万人口的城市照明用；全套的六千基罗瓦特水力透平发电机，不但及时供应了某水利工程，供应工业和农业的用电，并且也为一九五四年制造一万基罗瓦特水力发电设备在技术上提供了有利条件。二十四行拖拉曳引播种机，行距一百五十糎每小时可种地二垧，并且宽播密植，符合丰产要求，对进行农业的社会主义改造有重大的作用。东北的机械产品不但支援了鞍钢、全东北，也支援了全国。从河南机器厂、北京新京铁工厂到云南昆明的锡业公司，从新疆、广州到海南岛，都有东北出产的大批机床在飞速转动。
    几年来，东北机械新产品的品种、范围也在逐步扩大。如以一九四九年为一百，一九五○年则为二百零五，一九五一年为三百八十一，一九五二年为五百三十。在祖国五年计划的第一年，东北的机械工厂不但完成了国家的新产品计划，为了进一步支援鞍钢等重点工程，还超额完成四百一十六种新产品，使全年的新产品品种，等于一九四九年的十倍半。
