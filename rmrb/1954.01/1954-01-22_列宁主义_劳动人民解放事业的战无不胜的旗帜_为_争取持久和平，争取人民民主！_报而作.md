    Leninism – The Invincible Banner of the Laboring People's Liberation Cause
    -- Written for the "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Newspaper
    Dong Biwu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The great Lenin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, passed away thirty years ago. For these thirty years, Lenin's banner has always been held high at the front of the fighting ranks of the working people of the world, Leninism has always illuminated the future of all mankind, and Leninism is the invincible banner of the laboring people's liberation cause.
    Lenin developed the theories of Marx and Engels, making this theory a weapon of struggle for all oppressed people in the world. Lenin shattered the "theories" of the Second International revisionism. The "theorists" of the Second International ravaged the living theory of Marxism, turning it into a rigid dogma. They attempted to distort the proletarian revolutionary theory with bourgeois reformism, and to abolish proletarian internationalism with decadent nationalism. By clearing away all this slander of Marxism, Lenin brilliantly developed the principles of Marxism.
    Lenin scientifically proved that imperialism is the moribund stage of capitalism, and further proved that in the era of imperialism, due to the law of uneven development of capitalism, the socialist revolution can first achieve victory in several, or even one, country. Lenin demonstrated the tactical issues of the proletarian revolutionary struggle according to the situation of class struggle in the era of imperialism. Lenin developed Marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the theory of the worker-peasant alliance led by the proletariat. Lenin taught that without establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat conditioned on firmly uniting and leading the working peasantry, the complete victory of the cause of eliminating capitalism and establishing socialism cannot be guaranteed. Based on new revolutionary experience, Lenin creatively developed the theory of the transitional period from capitalism to socialism. These valuable ideas of Lenin are a guide for the working people of all countries to carry out the liberation struggle and move towards socialism and communism.
    When distorting Marxism, the traitors of the Second International also tried their best to limit the scope of application of Marxism, as if it could only be applied to the "civilized" countries of Europe. Lenin also shattered this nonsense. As early as the beginning of this century, Lenin greatly estimated the significance of the awakening movement of the Asian nations with huge populations. At that time, Lenin said: "The awakening of Asia and the beginning of the struggle of the advanced proletariat of Europe for power marked a new stage in world history that opened at the beginning of the twentieth century." ("The Awakening of Asia") Lenin regarded the power of the people of all Eastern nations seeking liberation as an important part of the worldwide socialist cause fighting against imperialism. Lenin illuminated the path of liberation for the people of all colonies and dependent countries with the light of Marxism.
    Lenin once instructed the communists of the Eastern nations: "You are faced with a task that has never been raised before communists all over the world, and that is: relying on the general theory and practice of communism, you must be good at applying this theory and practice to such conditions when applied to the unique conditions not present in European countries, namely, the peasantry is the main mass, and the task of struggle to be solved is not against capital but against the remnants of the Middle Ages.” Lenin further taught: "You should open up roads to the laboring and exploited masses of every country, and explain in a language they understand: the only hope for liberation is the victory of the international revolution, and the international proletariat is the only ally of all laborers and oppressed people in the hundreds of millions of people in the East.” ("On the Awakening of the Peoples of the East")
    It is precisely because the Chinese Communists properly implemented Lenin's precious teachings that they achieved a complete victory in the first stage of the Chinese revolution, opening up a bright future for the establishment of a socialist society in China.
    Commemorating our immortal great teacher – Lenin, we must, like Lenin, resolutely defend the principles of Marxism, defend the principles of proletarian internationalism, and also strive to, as Lenin wanted us to do, be good at applying the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism to various specific conditions of various nations and various periods. As long as we are faithful to the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and learn to apply it, our cause will be invincible.
    Based on the revolutionary doctrine of Marxism, Lenin established a new type of revolutionary proletarian party. This is a party guided by the scientific knowledge of the objective laws of social class struggle, and a party aimed at leading the proletariat to seize power and transforming the world with socialist principles. Lenin's party has a fundamental distinction from the reformist parties of the Second International. With Lenin's party, the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat has its own strong fortress.
    The organizational principles of the Marxist party founded by Lenin are followed by the Communist and Workers' Parties of every country in the world.
    Lenin resolutely struggled against opportunists who attempted to lower the standards of party members to the level of ordinary workers participating in strikes or even intellectuals sympathetic to the revolution. The actual intention of these opportunists was to abolish the party. Lenin insisted that the party must be the most conscious and most militant vanguard of the proletariat. But on the other hand, Lenin resolutely struggled against another type of opportunist who attempted to isolate the party from the broad masses around the party. This type of opportunist's attempt was also to destroy the party. Lenin taught us that the vanguard must never be separated from the fighting ranks of the broad masses, and must be good at contacting and educating the broad masses and leading the broad masses to advance together. Lenin demanded that the proletarian party should "be able to contact, approach, and to some extent even be said to merge with the broadest working masses – first of all with the proletarian working masses, but also with the non-proletarian working masses." (See "Left-Wing" Communism: an Infantile Disorder")
    Lenin taught us that the party must always care about the unity and solidarity within its ranks. The organizational unity of the party is based on the ideological consistency of Marxism and on the promotion of the enthusiasm of party members. The "unity" under bureaucracy and patriarchal rule has nothing in common with the unity required by Lenin's party. Lenin taught us that in order to consolidate the party's unity and discipline, it is necessary to mercilessly eliminate opportunists, class aliens, capitulationists, and traitors who are mixed in the party. Imperialists strive to collect and manufacture such scum, and painstakingly try to stuff them into the proletarian battle headquarters. There is no doubt that the more thoroughly we reject this filthy stuff, the healthier our body will develop. Lenin also taught us to strictly distinguish between this struggle to eliminate the enemies hidden in the party and the carrying out of criticism and self-criticism within the party, although these two things are interrelated. The party should strive to avoid mistakes and shortcomings in its work, but sincere workers sometimes inevitably make mistakes; therefore, promoting criticism and self-criticism within the party, especially criticism from the bottom up, and promptly correcting shortcomings and mistakes in work, are necessary methods for educating cadres and the masses and improving the combat effectiveness of our party.
    The principle of collective leadership of the party is one of the unshakable basic principles in the organizational life of the Leninist party. The reason why the proletarian revolutionary party can generate endless strength from within itself is because we are a combat organization organized according to the principle of democratic centralism as prescribed by Lenin. The characteristic of the party's democratic centralism lies in giving full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of all party members in the cause of the party, and in the fact that all resolutions and decisions of the party do not come from the opinions of any individual but are produced by the collective and thorough consideration of the leading organs. This collective system in the leading organs is based on the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of party members.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, established and developed under the direct leadership of Lenin and Stalin, set a brilliant example. The Communist Party of China, like the fraternal parties of other countries, has taken the party of Lenin and Stalin as its model from the very beginning.
    Commemorating our immortal great teacher – Lenin, we must be faithful to Lenin's organizational principles of the party, fight for the international solidarity of the communists, and fight for the continuous strengthening of the combat effectiveness of the vanguard of the working class of the world – the Communist Parties of all countries.
    The Soviet Union, created by the Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin, has become the strong and invincible fortress of the common cause of peace, democracy, and socialism for all mankind.
    The rich experience of the Soviet Union in building a socialist society is an inexhaustible treasure for China, as it is for all people's democratic countries. We learn from the Soviet Union's experience in socialist industrialization, learn how to transform individual agriculture through cooperatives, and learn how the working class uses the power of the regime to implement socialist construction. The theory of socialist construction of Lenin and Stalin and its practice in the Soviet Union makes us confidently move towards the goals of socialism and communism.
    The Soviet Union's peace policy laid by Lenin is a great gospel for the people of the world. The Soviet government has consistently and faithfully implemented Lenin's instructions and unwaveringly stood on the position of safeguarding world peace. The Soviet Union's peace policy supported the sacred struggle of the Korean people to defend their homeland and supported the Chinese people's struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. On the Korean battlefield, the aggressors had to accept the armistice agreement, and the ability of peace-loving people all over the world to achieve this great victory is inseparable from the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. The Soviet Union's peace policy has strengthened the confidence and strength of the people all over the world who demand peace. Now every kind and just person in the world can see with their own eyes that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all people's democratic countries are using all possible means to ease international tensions and promote the resolution of international disputes through consultation; while those who are obsessed with the so-called "Cold War" and attempt to impose the terror of war on the people of the world are the US imperialists and their lackeys.
    Lenin and Stalin's theory of the general crisis of capitalism is being proved by more and more facts day by day. Monopoly capitalists and their tools are frantically clamoring for war, precisely because they cannot help but feel that they are standing in front of the abyss of destruction.
    The great Lenin had already announced to the people of the world in a bell-like voice that the capitalist era in human history has gone forever, and a new era of infinite brilliance in human history – the era of socialism and communism – has begun. No force in the world can change this law of historical development.
    Commemorating the great teacher of the working people of the world – Lenin, we must infinitely strengthen the world camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union. Under Lenin's banner, the sacred cause of peace, democracy, and socialism will surely triumph!

    列宁主义——劳动人民解放事业的战无不胜的旗帜
    ——为“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报而作
    中国共产党中央政治局委员　董必武
    伟大的列宁，全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师，逝世于三十年前。这三十年来，列宁的旗帜始终高扬在全世界劳动人民的斗争队伍前面，列宁主义始终照耀着全世界人类的前途，列宁主义是劳动人民解放事业底战无不胜的旗帜。
    列宁发展了马克思、恩格斯的学说，使这种学说成为全世界一切被压迫人民的斗争武器。列宁粉碎了第二国际修正主义的“理论”。第二国际的“理论”家们把马克思主义的活的理论加以糟蹋，使之成为僵死的教条，他们企图用资产阶级改良主义来歪曲无产阶级的革命学说，用腐朽的民族主义来取消无产阶级的国际主义。由于扫除了这一切对于马克思主义的诬蔑，列宁就使马克思主义的原则得到了光辉的发展。
    列宁科学地证明了帝国主义是资本主义的垂死阶段，并且进一步证明在帝国主义时期，由于资本主义发展不平衡的规律的作用，社会主义革命能够在几个、甚至一个国家内首先取得胜利。列宁按照帝国主义时期的阶级斗争的形势论证了无产阶级革命斗争的策略问题。列宁发展了马克思所创立的关于无产阶级专政的学说和以无产阶级为领导的工农联盟的学说。列宁教导说，如果不建立以巩固地联合和领导劳动农民为条件的无产阶级专政，就不能保证消灭资本主义和建立社会主义的事业的完全胜利。列宁根据革命的新的经验创造性地发挥了关于从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的理论。列宁的这些宝贵的思想是一切国家的劳动人民进行解放斗争和走向社会主义与共产主义的指南。
    第二国际的叛徒们在歪曲马克思主义时又曾竭力限制马克思主义的应用范围，好像它只能适用于欧洲的“文明”国家。列宁也粉碎了这种胡言谰语。列宁早在本世纪的初年就很大地估计了拥有巨量人口的亚洲各民族觉醒运动的意义。当时列宁说：“亚洲的觉醒和欧洲先进无产阶级夺取政权的斗争的开端，标志了在二十世纪初所揭开的全世界历史的一个新阶段。”（“亚洲的觉醒”）列宁把东方各民族求解放的人民的力量看做是和帝国主义斗争的全世界社会主义事业的一个重要部分。列宁用马克思主义的光芒照亮了一切殖民地附属国人民的解放道路。
    列宁曾经向东方各民族的共产主义者指示说：“在你们面前摆着一个任务，这个任务从前在全世界共产党员面前是没有提出过的，这个任务就是：依靠一般共产主义的理论和实践，你们在应用于欧洲各国所没有的独特条件时，须要善于把这个理论和实践应用于这样的条件，即农民是主要群众，所要解决的斗争任务不是反对资本而是反对中世纪的残余。”列宁又教导说：“你们应当开辟走向每个国家劳动的和被剥削的群众的道路，并用他们懂得的语言来说明：解放之唯一希望就是国际革命的胜利，国际无产阶级是东方几万万人民所有劳动者和被压迫者底唯一同盟者。”（“论东方各族人民底觉醒”）
    中国共产党人就是恰当地执行了列宁的这个珍贵的教言，从而在中国革命的第一阶段中取得了完全的胜利，开辟了在中国建立社会主义社会的远大前途。
    纪念我们的不朽的伟大导师——列宁，我们要像列宁一样坚决地捍卫马克思主义的原则，捍卫无产阶级国际主义的原则，并且也要努力像列宁所要我们做的那样，善于把马克思列宁主义的学说运用于各个民族各个时期的各种不同的具体条件下。只要我们忠实于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，并学会去运用它，我们的事业就是不可战胜的。
    列宁以马克思主义的革命学说为基础，建立了新型的革命无产阶级的政党。这是以社会阶级斗争的客观规律的科学知识为指导方针的党，这是以领导无产阶级取得政权并以社会主义的原则来改造世界为目的的党。列宁的党和第二国际的改良主义的政党有原则上的区别，有了列宁的党，国际无产阶级的革命事业才有了自己的坚强的堡垒。
    列宁所创立的马克思主义政党的组织原则是全世界每个国家的共产党和工人党所遵奉的。
    列宁曾坚决地和企图把党员的标准降低到参加罢工的普通工人乃至同情革命的知识分子那样的水平的机会主义者作斗争，机会主义者的这种企图的实际用意就是取消党。列宁坚持党必须是无产阶级中最觉悟的最有斗志的先锋部队。但在另一方面，列宁又坚决地和企图使党和在党周围的广大群众相隔绝的另一种机会主义者作斗争，这种机会主义者的企图同样地也是使党灭亡。列宁教导我们，先锋部队绝对不可脱离广大群众的战斗队伍，必须善于去联系、教育广大群众，带同广大群众一起前进。列宁要求无产阶级政党应“善于与最广大的劳动群众——首先是与无产者劳动群众，但同样也与非无产者劳动群众——联系，接近，在某种程度上甚至可以说是与他们溶成一片”。（见“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”）
    列宁教导我们，党必须时时刻刻关心自己队伍内部的统一和团结。党在组织上的统一是以马克思主义思想上的一致为基础的，是以发扬党员群众的积极性为基础的。在官僚主义和家长式的统治下的“统一”和列宁的党所要求的统一没有一点共同的地方。列宁教导我们，巩固党的统一和纪律，就必须毫不容情地清除混在党内的机会主义分子，阶级异己分子，投降主义者和叛徒。帝国主义者努力收集和制造这种败类，处心积虑地想把他们塞进无产阶级的战斗司令部中来。毫无疑问，我们愈能彻底地排斥这种污浊东西，就使我们的躯体愈加健康发展。列宁又教导我们，要把这种清除暗藏在党内的敌人的斗争和进行党内的批评和自我批评两件事严格地区别开来，虽然这两件事又是相互关连的。党应该力求避免工作中的错误和缺点，但诚恳的工作者有时也难免发生错误；因此，发扬党内的批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，并及时改正工作中的缺点和错误，乃是教育干部与群众，提高我们党的战斗力所必须的方法。
    党的集体领导原则是列宁主义的党的组织生活中不可动摇的基本原则之一。无产阶级革命政党之所以能从自己内部产生无穷无尽的力量，就因为我们是按列宁所规定的民主集中制而组成的战斗组织。党的民主集中制的特征就在于发挥所有的党员对党的事业的积极性和主动性，就在于党的所有决议和决定都不是来自任何个人的意见而是产生于领导机关中集体的周密的考虑，这种领导机关中的集体制度又是以广大党员的积极性和主动性为基础的。
    在列宁和斯大林直接领导下所建立和发展起来的苏联共产党树立了一个光辉的榜样。中国共产党，正如其他国家的兄弟党一样，从一开始就是取法于列宁斯大林的党的。
    纪念我们的不朽的伟大导师——列宁，我们就要忠实于列宁的党的组织原则，为共产主义者的国际团结而斗争，为不断地加强全世界工人阶级的前卫——各国共产党的战斗力而斗争。
    以列宁为首的布尔什维克党所缔造的苏联已成为和平、民主、社会主义的全人类共同事业的坚强无敌的堡垒。
    苏联在建设社会主义社会中的丰富的经验对于中国，也正如对于一切人民民主国家一样，是取之不尽的宝库。我们从苏联的经验中学习社会主义工业化的方法，学习如何通过合作社来改造个体农业，学习工人阶级怎样运用政权的力量来实行社会主义的建设。列宁、斯大林的社会主义建设理论及其在苏联的实践使得我们确有把握地向着社会主义和共产主义的目标前进。
    由列宁所奠定的苏联的和平政策对于全世界人民是一个伟大的福音。苏联政府一贯忠诚地执行着列宁的训示，毫不动摇地站在卫护世界和平的立场上。苏联的和平政策支持了朝鲜人民为保卫自己的国土而进行的神圣斗争，支持了中国人民的抗美援朝的斗争。在朝鲜战场上，侵略者不得不接受停战协定，全世界爱好和平的人民能够获得这一伟大的胜利是和苏联的和平外交政策不可分的。苏联的和平政策使全世界要求和平的人民增强了信心和力量。现在全世界每一个善良公正的人都能用自己的眼睛看到，苏联、中华人民共和国和一切人民民主国家是在用一切可能的方法来和缓国际紧张局势，促成以协商方式解决国际争端；而醉心于所谓“冷战”，企图以战争的恐怖强加于全世界人民的乃是美帝国主义者和它的走狗们。
    列宁和斯大林关于资本主义总危机的学说正在一天比一天由更多的事实来给以证明。独占资本家们及其工具疯狂地叫嚣战争，正是因为他们自己也不能不感到自己是站在毁灭的深渊前面。
    伟大的列宁早已用警钟一样的声音向全世界人民宣布，人类历史中的资本主义的时代已经一去不返，人类历史中的一个无限辉煌的新时代——社会主义与共产主义的时代已经开始了。世界上没有任何力量能够改变这个历史发展的规律。
    纪念全世界劳动人民的伟大导师——列宁，我们就要无限地加强以苏联为首的世界和平、民主、社会主义的阵营。在列宁的旗帜下，和平、民主、社会主义的神圣事业一定能够取得胜利！
