The supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties of Ningxia Province are strengthening the supply of production materials to meet the demands of farmers who are expanding production after selling their surplus grain.

In late December of last year, the Wuzhong City Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a special exhibition of production materials, exhibiting more than 600 kinds of production materials. They also sent cadres to the meeting to publicize and explain to the visiting farmers. After visiting the exhibits and listening to the explanations, the farmers purchased farm tools one after another. Within four days, the cooperative's turnover reached 114 million yuan. The Ning'an Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhongning County organized local carpenters, blacksmiths, and other handicraft workers last winter to make 850 wooden shovels, 45 iron rakes, 120 sets of donkey saddles, more than 200 iron hoes, more than 200 manure forks, and many other small farm tools for the farmers. Before manufacturing these farm tools, the cooperative proactively solicited the opinions of local farmers to ensure that the manufactured farm tools met the needs of the farmers. In December 1953, the Pingluo County Cooperative and the state trading departments sold various farm tools and draught animals to farmers worth more than 1.43 billion yuan. Among them, the supply and marketing cooperative supplied farmers with 227 head of cattle, 17 mules and horses, one rubber-tired cart, 120 iron shovels, and 470 other farm tools. According to farmers' requests, the county's supply and marketing cooperatives have recently ordered 290 head of cattle and more than 20 mules from other places. In addition to vigorously supplying farmers with production materials, the supply and marketing cooperatives have also strengthened the supply of daily necessities for farmers. Through these supply works, the farmers' understanding of the cooperatives has been greatly improved, and farmers in various places have requested to join the cooperative and purchase shares. The Wuzhong City Supply and Marketing Cooperative absorbed 576 shares of capital in ten days. Through the supply of production materials, the Zhongning Ning'an Supply and Marketing Cooperative also developed 596 new members.

　　宁夏合作社加强供应工作协助农民扩大生产
    宁夏省各县供销合作社加强生产资料的供应工作，满足广大农民出售余粮后扩大生产的要求。
    吴忠市供销合作社在去年十二月下旬，专门举办了一次生产资料展览会，展览各种生产资料六百多种，并派干部在会上给参观农民宣传解释。农民参观了展览品和听了解释后，都纷纷购置农具，四天内该社营业额即达一亿一千四百多万元。中宁县宁安供销合作社去年冬天就把当地木匠业、铁器业等手工业者组织起来，给农民做了八百五十把木锨，四十五张铁耙，一百二十付驴鞍，二百多把铁铣，二百多把粪杈和其他许多小型农具。在制造这些农具前，合作社主动地征求了当地农民意见，使制造出来的农具都能切合农民的需要。平罗县合作社和国家贸易部门在一九五三年十二月份，卖给农民的各种农具、耕畜价值十四亿三千多万元。其中供销合作社供应给农民的耕牛就有二百二十七头，骡、马十七匹，胶轮大车一辆，铁锹一百二十把和其他农具四百七十件。该县各地供销合作社最近又根据农民要求，从外地订购了二百九十头耕牛、二十多头骡子。供销合作社除大力供应农民生产资料外，还加强了对农民生活必需品的供应。通过这些供应工作，大大地提高了农民对合作社的认识，各地农民都纷纷要求入股入社。吴忠市供销合作社在十天中就吸收了五百七十六股股金，中宁宁安供销合作社，通过生产资料的供应，也发展了五百九十六名新社员。
