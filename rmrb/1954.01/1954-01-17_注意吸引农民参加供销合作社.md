	Pay Attention to Attracting Farmers to Join Supply and Marketing Cooperatives

	Developing supply and marketing cooperatives is an indispensable step in realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture. Vividly publicizing the benefits of supply and marketing cooperation to farmers will, in an important aspect, attract farmers to take the socialist road and abandon the capitalist road. The report published in a prominent position in the Fujian Daily on December 15th about the Nanping County Fifth District Xiqin Supply and Marketing Cooperative holding a meeting of cooperative member representatives to publicize the general line to farmers illustrates that farmers, through detailed calculations and comparisons, have further recognized the benefits of supply and marketing cooperatives and enhanced their socialist consciousness, thereby laying an ideological foundation for the work of grain purchase and developing new members.

	Nanping County Fifth District is a mountainous area. Local farmers have to take their abundant local specialties, such as timber, tung oil, and hogs, to the market every year to sell in exchange for grain, cloth, agricultural tools, fertilizers, and other means of production and daily necessities. But in the past, all the farmers' buying and selling had to be subjected to the cruel exploitation of private merchants. As cooperative member representative Wang Ligang said: "There was no cooperative at that time, so what could we do? We had to 'drink salt water when thirsty,' and just grit our teeth and let them exploit us." It was not until the establishment of the supply and marketing cooperative in March 1952 that this situation of "drinking salt water when thirsty" gradually changed with the growth of the cooperative's strength.

	Farmers have their own understanding and experience of who is better or worse, supply and marketing cooperatives or private merchants. But without specific guidance, the average farmer is not very clear about it. This requires the newspaper to play a role in publicity and education to help farmers specifically draw this line. And this report is doing just that. It focuses on introducing how Zheng Jiayan, director of the Xiqin Supply and Marketing Cooperative, used a concrete accounting method, starting from the fact that the supply and marketing cooperative provides production services for farmers, to educate farmers to recognize the benefits of joining the supply and marketing cooperative. For example, the report said that when wheat was on the market in 1953, private merchants cut prices, offering only 75,000 to 90,000 yuan per dan; while the cooperative listed it at 103,000 yuan and purchased 54,700 jin at one time, which alone saved farmers from 7 to 8 million yuan in intermediate exploitation. In the summer, when everyone lacked food, the cooperative not only helped farmers sell hundreds of millions of yuan worth of soil baskets, charcoal, hogs, and other products, helping farmers overcome difficulties; but also supplied more than 800,000 jin of rice at a price of 2,000 yuan cheaper per dan than private merchants, which saved farmers from more than 16 million yuan in intermediate exploitation. If the prices of agricultural and sideline products sold by the cooperative for its members and the means of production and daily necessities supplied to the members from January to October 1953 were compared with the prices of private merchants one by one, the cooperative helped farmers avoid 86.616 million yuan in intermediate exploitation in ten months, and this money could buy one hundred and eight large castrated oxen.

	These vivid facts made the more than eighty representatives present feel much clearer. The newspaper wrote that cooperative member representative Kang Mingwang said in a group meeting after listening to the report: "With the cooperative, soil baskets and tung oil can be sold this year, and we didn't have to eat expensive rice during the spring plowing. We farmers are more at ease with production than before. We are now taking the road of socialism. Supply and marketing cooperatives, like mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, are an indispensable good ferry boat. Taking this ferry boat will prevent us from being deceived and exploited by private merchants and steadily ferry us to a socialist society." He guaranteed to go back and actively mobilize farmers to join the supply and marketing cooperative, so that every household in the village would become a member.

	The report shows that farmers have the demand and enthusiasm to participate in supply and marketing cooperatives. The problem lies in being good at adopting various effective methods to educate and attract farmers to take this ferry boat to socialist society.

### 注意吸引农民参加供销合作社

    注意吸引农民参加供销合作社
    发展供销合作，是实现农业的社会主义改造的一个不可缺少的步骤。向农民生动地宣传供销合作的好处，就能在一个重要的方面吸引农民走社会主义道路，而抛弃资本主义道路。福建日报十二月十五日以显著地位发表的南平县五区西芹供销合作社召开社员代表大会向农民宣传总路线的报道，就说明农民们通过算细账和回忆、对比，进一步认识了供销合作社的好处，提高了社会主义觉悟，从而为购粮和发展新社员的工作打下了思想基础。
    南平县五区是一个山区。当地农民每年都要把出产丰富的木材、桐油、毛猪等土特产品拿到市场上出售，以换取粮食、布匹、农具、肥料等生产资料和生活资料。但在过去，农民的一切买卖都要受私商的残酷剥削。正如社员代表王礼广所说的：“那时没有合作社，有什么办法呢？‘嘴渴喝盐卤’，也只好咬咬牙齿让他们剥削去了。”直到一九五二年三月供销合作社成立以后，随着合作社力量的壮大，才逐渐改变了这种“嘴渴喝盐卤”的情况。
    农民对于供销合作社和私商谁好谁坏，是有他们自己的认识和体验的。但不经过具体的指引，一般农民并不是十分了然的。这就有待于报纸发挥宣传教育作用，帮助农民具体地划清这个界限。而这篇报道正是这样作的。它着重地介绍了西芹供销合作社主任郑家炎用具体算账的方式，从供销合作社为农民生产服务的事实入手，来教育农民认识参加供销合作社的好处。例如，报道中说，一九五三年小麦登场时，私商杀价，每担只出七万五千到九万元；而合作社挂牌十万三千元，一次收购了五万四千七百斤，仅这一项就使农民免除了七、八百万元的中间剥削。夏季当大家缺乏口粮时，合作社不仅替农民推销了价值数亿元的土箕、木炭、毛猪等产品，帮助农民克服困难；而且以每担比私商便宜二千元的价格，供应了八十万多斤大米，使农民又少受了一千六百多万元的中间剥削。如果以合作社一九五三年一月至十月替社员推销出去的农副产品和供应社员的生产资料、生活资料的价格，和私商的价格逐一对比，则十个月内合作社就帮助农民免除了八千六百十六万元的中间剥削，用这笔钱可以买一百零八头大犍牛。
    这些活生生的事实，使得到会的八十多位代表心里亮了好多。报纸写道，社员代表康明旺听了报告后，在小组会上说：“有了合作社，今年土箕、桐油都销得出去，春耕时也没有吃贵米，我们农民生产比以前放心得多了。我们现在要走社会主义的道路，供销合作社和互助组、农业生产合作社一样，是条不可缺少的好渡船，搭这条渡船便不会受私商的欺骗剥削，安安稳稳地把我们渡到社会主义社会。”他保证回去积极动员农民参加供销合作社，做到全村每户农民都入社。
    报道说明农民是有参加供销合作社的要求和积极性的。问题就在于要善于采取各种有效的方法，来教育和吸引农民搭这条渡船到社会主义社会。
