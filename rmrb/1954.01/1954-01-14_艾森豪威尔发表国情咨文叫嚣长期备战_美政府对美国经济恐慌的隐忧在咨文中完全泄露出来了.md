Xinhua News Agency, Washington: U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered his State of the Union Address to the Second Session of the 83rd Congress on the 7th. This address, under the guise of words about peace and freedom, put forward a policy program of continued expansion, long-term war preparations, and strengthened fascist rule.

    What is striking about the address is its heavy militaristic atmosphere. Military issues were discussed more than any other issue in the address. On the one hand, Eisenhower continued to scare the American people with the so-called "communist threat," demanding that they bear the burden of war preparations for a long time. On the other hand, he threatened the people of all countries with atomic warfare.

    The first part of the main text of the address dealt almost entirely with military matters. Under the heading of diplomacy, Eisenhower mentioned the key points where the United States would continue to create tensions around the world: In the Far East, the United States would "maintain our (American) vital interests in Korea," "maintain our bases on Okinawa indefinitely," "continue to accelerate the victorious conclusion of the war in Indochina with material assistance," and "continue to provide military and economic aid to the Nationalist government," etc. In Western Europe, Eisenhower emphasized: "The North Atlantic Treaty is the solid foundation of our policy. It will continue to be this foundation for the foreseeable future." He said that within this treaty organization, "the establishment of a unified European group including Germany and France is extremely important," and that "the European Defense Community will promote the realization of this goal." When it came to foreign "aid," Eisenhower announced that the United States would continue military "aid" while reducing economic "aid."

    Eisenhower only briefly mentioned the issue of negotiations on atomic energy, and he did not mention the Soviet government's proposal to ban atomic weapons. Eisenhower did not say a word about the issue of easing international tensions, which is of concern to people all over the world. Instead, he repeatedly emphasized "positions of strength" in his address. Eisenhower gave a lengthy account of the United States' military concepts, the main points of which were: developing atomic weapons, focusing on the development of new weapons and air force, and concentrating strategic reserves to maintain mobility. Eisenhower also emphasized: "The effectiveness of new weapons... can save manpower." This cannot but lead people to believe that the U.S. government is not prepared to reduce armaments to promote peace, but only because its own aggressive forces are insufficient, and it has no choice but to seek a "way out" in long-term war preparations. At the same time, it is brandishing bankrupt "atomic weapons," "new weapons," and "great air force-ism" to intimidate and maintain international tensions.

    In terms of domestic affairs, Eisenhower first raised the so-called "domestic security" issue of strengthening fascist rule and further depriving the people of their democratic freedoms. He boasted that since he implemented the new employee review standards, the federal government had fired more than 2,200 staff members. He demanded that the fascist investigation and review of national employees be accelerated. As expected, Eisenhower called on Congress to enact legislation to effectively outlaw the Communist Party. He said that anyone who consciously participates in the activities of the Communist Party is "disloyal to the United States," and he demanded that the law should stipulate that once a court determines this "crime," these people should be deprived of their U.S. citizenship.

    The address also devoted considerable space to boasting about the Eisenhower administration's economic measures. However, the address could not hide the White House's hidden concerns about the future development of the American economic crisis. Eisenhower said that the U.S. economy is currently undergoing a period of "transition." He said his government is prepared to take measures at any time to deal with "new developments" in the economy. He admitted that American agriculture is now in a serious crisis of oversupply. The Commodity Credit Corporation, which is responsible for purchasing agricultural products to maintain price levels, has spent billions of dollars purchasing and stockpiling unsalable dairy products, wheat, cotton, corn, and certain rapeseed oils. He said: "Some products are not priced competitively in the domestic market, while others are not priced competitively in the world market, and they are all piled up in the hands of the government... Surplus products continue to threaten the market, and although current laws stipulate restrictions on cultivated land, surplus products will continue to increase."

    It is worth mentioning that three days before delivering the address, Eisenhower specifically made a reassuring broadcast to the nation, emphasizing that his government was ready to "take all proper measures" to maintain economic "prosperity" at any time. Reuters reporter Rankin pointed out at the time that an increasing number of people in the United States were discussing the possibility of business downturns, recessions, and panics in 1954. It is noteworthy that Eisenhower felt it necessary to make this guarantee through broadcasting. Rankin said: "It seems that this talk has reached the point where it must be offset by the president's guarantee." Rankin also pointed out that the original text of the broadcast speech distributed by the White House to the press was "If necessary, the government will adopt" all measures, but then the White House notified that this sentence should be changed to "Because it is necessary, the government is taking" all measures. Rankin said: Eisenhower was so careful in his speech in this regard because he was afraid that the talk about the end of prosperity itself would depress business confidence, cause industrial and commercial recession, or accelerate the development of recession into an economic panic.

    However, Rankin said: Eisenhower's speech is bound to make the nationwide discussion of panic more profound.

### 艾森豪威尔发表国情咨文叫嚣长期备战  美政府对美国经济恐慌的隐忧在咨文中完全泄露出来了

    艾森豪威尔发表国情咨文叫嚣长期备战
    美政府对美国经济恐慌的隐忧在咨文中完全泄露出来了
   【新华社讯】华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔七日向美国第八十三届国会第二期会议发表国情咨文。这个咨文在一些关于和平、自由的辞藻掩盖下，提出了一个继续扩张、长期备战和加强法西斯统治的施政纲领。
    咨文引人注意的是它的浓重的军国主义气息。咨文中军事问题比任何其他问题谈得都多。艾森豪威尔一方面继续以所谓“共产主义威胁”的谰调吓唬美国人民，要他们长期承受备战的重担，另一方面又以原子战争恫吓各国人民。
    咨文主文的第一部分几乎完全谈的是军事。在外交项下，艾森豪威尔提到美国将在全世界继续制造紧张局势的要点为：在远东方面，美国要“保持我们（美国）在朝鲜的重要权益”，要“无限期保持我们在冲绳岛上的基地”，要“继续以物资援助加速印度支那战争的胜利结束”，要“继续给予国民党政府以军事和经济援助”等。在西欧方面，艾森豪威尔强调：“北大西洋公约是我们政策的坚实基础。在可以看得见的将来，它将继续是这种基础。”他说，在这个公约组织里面，“建立一个包括德国和法国的统一的欧洲集团是极其重要的”，而“欧洲防务集团将能促进这一目的的实现”。谈到对外“援助”问题时，艾森豪威尔宣布美国将继续军事“援助”，而减少经济“援助”。
    艾森豪威尔只用几句话就带过了关于原子能的谈判问题，他只字未提苏联政府提出的禁止原子武器的建议。艾森豪威尔对于全世界人民所关心的缓和国际紧张局势的问题绝口不谈，却在咨文中一再强调“实力地位”。艾森豪威尔长篇大套地叙述了美国的军事观念，要点是：发展原子武器、着重发展新武器和空军、把战略后备力量集中起来保持机动性。艾森豪威尔还强调说：“新武器的效用……能够节省人力。”这不能不使人认为：美国政府并没有准备削减军备以促进和平，而只是因为自身侵略力量不足，不得不在长期备战中寻求“脱身”办法，同时舞弄着破产了的“原子武器”、“新武器”、“大空军主义”来进行恫吓，以保持国际紧张局势。
    在内政方面，艾森豪威尔首先就提出加强法西斯统治、进一步剥夺人民的民主自由权利的所谓“国内安全”问题。他夸耀说，自从他实施了新的雇员审查标准以来，联邦政府已开除了二千二百多个工作人员。他要求还要加快对国家雇员进行的法西斯调查和审查。如大家所预料的，艾森豪威尔要求国会制订立法，以在实际上把共产党投入非法地位。他说，凡是自觉地参加共产党活动的，就是“不忠于美国”，他要求法律应规定，一经法庭判定这个“罪”名，就剥夺这些人的美国公民资格。
    咨文也用了相当的篇幅吹嘘艾森豪威尔政府的经济措施。但是，咨文却无法掩盖白宫对美国经济危机发展前途的隐忧。艾森豪威尔说，美国经济目前正在经历一个“转变”时期。他说他的政府准备随时采取措施以应付经济上发生“新的情况”。他承认美国农业现在已处于严重的过剩危机中。负责收购农业品以维持价格水平的商品信用公司，已花了几十亿美元来购囤销不掉的乳制品、小麦、棉花、玉蜀黍和某些菜籽油。他说：“有些产品是在国内市场上价钱不合，另一些产品在世界市场上价钱不合，都堆在政府手里。……过剩的产品继续威胁着市场，尽管现行法律规定限制耕地面积，过剩产品仍将有增无已。”
    值得提到的是：在发表咨文的前三天，艾森豪威尔曾特地向全国作了一次安定人心的广播，着重“保证”他的政府随时准备“采取一切正当办法”来维持经济的“繁荣”。路透社记者兰金当时就指出，美国有越来越多的人在议论一九五四年可能发生企业不振、衰退和恐慌。艾森豪威尔竟然觉得有必要通过广播来提出这个保证是值得注意的。兰金说：“看来这种谈论已经达到必须用总统的保证来抵消它的地步了。”兰金又指出，白宫向新闻界散发的广播辞原文是“如果有必要，政府将采用”一切办法，但接着白宫又通知把这句话改成“因为有必要，政府正在采取”一切办法。兰金说：艾森豪威尔在这方面讲话这样小心，是怕关于繁荣会终止的谈话本身就会使企业界的信心低落，引起工商业衰退或使衰退加速发展成经济恐慌。
    但是，兰金说：艾森豪威尔的谈话势必使全国对恐慌的谈论更加深入。
