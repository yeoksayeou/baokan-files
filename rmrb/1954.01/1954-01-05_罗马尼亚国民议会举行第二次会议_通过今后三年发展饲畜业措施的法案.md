Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, Bucharest dispatch: The Second Session of the National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic was held in Bucharest from December 28th to 30th, 1953. The heads of various government departments, led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, attended the opening ceremony of the session.

The session heard a statement by Gheorghe Apostol, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, regarding the draft law on measures for developing the livestock industry from 1954 to 1956. After discussion, the session unanimously passed the law. The law pointed out that due to the Romanian Workers' Party and the government's policy of further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, Romania has made great achievements in developing the livestock industry. The number of livestock at the beginning of 1953 had exceeded the pre-war level. In the period from 1948 to the beginning of 1953, the number of cattle increased by 490,000, pigs increased by 2,064,000, and horses increased by 141,000. However, the growth of livestock numbers and livestock product productivity still lags behind the continuous growth of the urban population and its increasing need for livestock products. Therefore, the main tasks of the livestock industry from 1954 to 1956 are: to greatly improve the supply of livestock products to urban and rural residents, as well as the supply of raw materials needed for light industry and the food industry. The goal for 1956 is: to increase the number of cattle to 4,930,000, including 2,365,000 cows; sheep to 13,800,000; pigs to 4,600,000; and horses to 1,240,000. The sown area of ​​feed crops will be increased to 1,300,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare). The law also stipulates various specific methods for developing the livestock industry.

The session approved the decrees issued by the Presidium of the National Assembly since the First Session of the National Assembly in 1953. The session also elected Gheorghe Vlădescu to be a member of the Presidium of the National Assembly.

    罗马尼亚国民议会举行第二次会议
    通过今后三年发展饲畜业措施的法案
    【新华社四日讯】布加勒斯特消息：罗马尼亚人民共和国国民议会第二次会议，于一九五三年十二月二十八日到三十日在布加勒斯特举行。以罗马尼亚部长会议主席乔治乌—德治为首的政府各部门首长参加了会议的开幕仪式。
    会议听取了部长会议副主席兼农业与林业部部长格·阿波斯托尔对于一九五四—一九五六年发展饲畜业措施的法案的说明。会议经讨论后一致通过了这项法案。法案指出：由于罗马尼亚工人党和政府实行进一步巩固由工人阶级领导的工农联盟的政策，罗马尼亚在发展饲畜业方面已取得了巨大的成就。一九五三年初的牲畜头数已超过战前水平。在一九四八年到一九五三年年初的时期中，牛增加了四十九万头，猪增加了二百零六万四千口，马增加了十四万一千匹。但是，牲畜头数和畜产品生产率的增长，现在仍然落后于城市人口的不断增长及其对于畜产品的不断增加的需要。因此，一九五四—一九五六年饲畜业的主要任务是：大大改进对于城乡居民的畜产品的供应，以及对于轻工业和食品工业所需原料的供应。一九五六年的目标是：牛增为四百九十三万头，其中包括二百三十六万五千头母牛；羊增为一千三百八十万只；猪增为四百六十万口；马增为一百二十四万匹。饲料作物的播种面积将增加到一百三十万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）。法案并规定了发展饲畜业的各项具体办法。
    会议批准了一九五三年国民议会举行第一次会议以来国民议会主席团所颁布的法令。会议还选举格·维德拉希库为国民议会主席团委员。
