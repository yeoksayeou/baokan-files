    [This Newspaper] News: The North China Administrative Committee People's Supervisory Committee, according to the instructions of the Government Administration Council People's Supervisory Committee, in conjunction with the North China Military Region Logistics Military Supplies Production Department and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and other organizations, thoroughly investigated the illegal incidents of the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory and some private manufacturers using shoddy work and inferior materials in processing and manufacturing military rubber shoes for the Volunteer Army. The results of the thorough investigation confirmed that about one-fifth of this batch of processed and manufactured military rubber shoes had deterioration phenomena such as sponge stickiness, stiff, yellowed, sticky, waxy, frosty and yellowed foxing strips, of which more than 100,000 pairs of rubber shoes were scrapped entirely (all products of the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory). This item alone, calculated only on the basis of labor and material costs, resulted in a loss of more than 1.4 billion yuan.
    The processing and manufacturing of this batch of military rubber shoes was entrusted by the Volunteer Army logistics organs to the North China Military Region Logistics Military Supplies Production Department. From December 1951 to May 1952, the Factory Management Office of the North China Military Region Logistics Military Supplies Production Department and the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory and 24 private rubber factories such as Yu Fu signed agreements for processing military rubber shoes in two batches. The Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory undertook the largest processing quantity and should bear the main responsibility for the military rubber shoe deterioration incident. Shi Siliang, the general manager of the factory, did not regard undertaking the production of this batch of military rubber shoes as a glorious political task, but instead felt that it "made little money and was troublesome," and did not pay attention to this task, handing it over to the factory's First Branch. When deploying the task, he only convened a meeting of a few relevant responsible cadres, talked about the task, time, technology and specifications, and did not even hand over the agreement signed with the military to the First Branch. Throughout the entire manufacturing process, he rarely asked about it and did not conduct any inspections. The leading cadres of the First Branch also treated this task with the same irresponsible attitude. Deputy Factory Director Liu Tong did not conduct the necessary political mobilization of the workers. Technician Chen Guojun, who was in charge of the factory's technical work, did not actively make various technical preparations, but simply ordered the start of work. As a result, there were many errors in operation methods, and many chaotic phenomena occurred in technology, which was one of the main reasons for the deterioration of rubber shoes. For example, in the manufacture of the first batch of rubber shoes, worker Wang Guirong thought that the back part of the rubber shoe sole was too fat, making it difficult to bond with the foxing strip. With the consent of foreman Xie Yuhai, he arbitrarily ground off two centimeters of the back of the sole sample specified by the military, so that the finished product did not meet the specifications, and 9,000 pairs of shoes were rejected by the military. Another example is that there was no standard method in technology. Instead of researching and maturing before manufacturing, it was done by experimenting and manufacturing at the same time. Taking the sponge formula as an example, it was changed six times in eight days, and there were large differences between the materials used and the amount used and the standard formula, which affected the quality of the finished product. In particular, in order to simply pursue the quantity of finished products, the factory blindly increased the number of shoes in the vulcanization process and prolonged the vulcanization time, resulting in over-vulcanization or under-vulcanization, and the occurrence of deterioration phenomena such as "sponge stickiness" and "sole hardening." What is most intolerable is that the factory twice replaced the military's good rubber with inferior materials. The first time, Gao Yukun, the workshop team leader, believed that the military's No. 3 raw rubber was of better quality and suitable for making white foxing strips for commodity rubber shoes. He proposed this to technician Chen Guojun, and with the consent of factory director Sun Yunsheng, he replaced about 500 kilograms of good rubber with inferior rubber. Chen Guojun was afraid that the military would discover it, and also instructed Gao Yukun to "keep it secret." The second time, another worker made the same proposal to Chen Guojun (who had been promoted to deputy factory director at this time). With the consent of Liu Tong (who had been promoted to factory director at this time), and with Liu's authorization, he asked Shi Siliang, the general manager, for instructions. Shi's reply was: "If it does not affect the quality of military rubber shoes, it can be exchanged." As a result, 1,211 kilograms of the military's No. 2 rubber were replaced with No. 3 rubber. This kind of theft is one of the reasons for the insufficient rubber content of the finished product. Chemical tests proved that the finished product was short of rubber by 4.325 to 4.75 catties per hundred catties. In addition, the factory also exchanged 146 yards of the military's whole cloth with scraps of shoe lining cloth. Wang Shiqi, the business section chief of the general factory, also misappropriated 800 kilograms of the military's lithopone, 800 kilograms of zinc oxide, 2,246 kilograms of benzene oil, and Ming yellow, accelerator and other items.
    This kind of illegal behavior of the First Branch of the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory is not the first time. As early as May 1950, when processing and manufacturing rubber shoes for a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Zhong Ming, the former factory director of the factory, bullied the military for not having inspectors, and secretly instructed technician Chen Guojun to reduce the width of the front and rear of the sole and the length of the foxing strip by one centimeter each, obtaining illegal profits of 200 million yuan. In August 1951, the Volunteer Army logistics organs entrusted the North China Military Region Logistics Military Supplies Production Department to process and manufacture cotton shoes for the factory. The original regulations stipulated that felt should be placed on the front of the shoes, but the factory actually replaced it with inferior leather and scraps of cloth. Wei Shuqing, the workshop inspector, felt that this was unfair to the Volunteer Army and raised several opinions, but to no avail. Finally, Wei Shuqing reported this illegal behavior to the military inspectors. Zhong Ming, the former factory director, and Liu Tong, the deputy factory director, not only did not admit their mistakes, but instead severely reprimanded Wei and forced him to admit the mistake of not maintaining the factory's "interests." In the end, Wei was transferred away from the factory and was not allowed to do inspection work again.
    The cadres of the North China Military Region Logistics Military Supplies Production Department who were responsible for undertaking the rubber shoe processing task this time did not learn from the lessons of the raincoat incident in the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao (for news about this incident, see this newspaper on December 13, 1951), and especially did not take the illegal behavior of the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory in violating specifications when processing and manufacturing cotton shoes for the Volunteer Army as a warning. They still adopted an extremely irresponsible bureaucratic attitude. Zhang Zhichen, the director of the factory management office of the department, did not carefully study many important issues related to determining the quality of finished products, such as "unified formula," "formula standard," and how to conduct supervision and inspection, when carrying out the first batch of rubber shoe processing, and handed over such an important task to Su Ruoyu, a staff member of the business section, and said to Su: "The agreement and contract only need to be signed by the section, and do not need to go through the director." After he hastily explained the task, he never conducted any inspections. It was not until the military rubber shoe deterioration incident occurred and both batches of finished products were put into the warehouse that the department and the factory signed a supplementary contract. Su Ruoyu, who was directly responsible for this processing work, was also extremely irresponsible. He entrusted the "standard formula" to a private Yitang Rubber Factory to formulate, and without research by public technical personnel, only after hasty review and revision by the technical group of the promotion group jointly formed by the Logistics Military Supplies Production Department and the Tianjin Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce and the Rubber Industry Association, it was implemented as a legal standard. Many provisions of this "standard formula" were unreasonable, did not specify the rubber content of "recycled rubber," and had excessively low requirements for the physical properties of the finished product. The North China Military Region Logistics Military Supplies Production Department also did not inspect the implementation of the various factories in accordance with this "standard formula," and even did not have a unified formula storage certificate. This serious dereliction of duty made the Tianjin Local State-Owned Rubber Factory and private manufacturers dare to recklessly use shoddy materials, steal state property, and fail to act in accordance with the contract. Chemical tests proved that the private Yu Fu Rubber Factory stole and reduced 20 catties of raw rubber for every hundred catties used. They were also very irresponsible in the packaging and storage of finished products. The rubber shoes should have been packaged in wooden boxes, but because they were troublesome, they were replaced with sacks, which accelerated the deterioration of the rubber shoes. Of the same finished products, only 30% of those packaged in wooden boxes deteriorated, while more than 98% of those packaged in sacks deteriorated. The leaders of the Tianjin New Warehouse under the department did not accept the lessons of the past when rubber shoes leaked due to improper storage, and still stored this batch of military rubber shoes as general materials according to the past methods, and there were many unreasonable phenomena in the storage methods and equipment. These also accelerated the deterioration of the rubber shoes to a certain extent. Although the warehouse had a system of monthly inspections, it was only a formality, so the deterioration of a large number of military rubber shoes was not discovered for a long time; it was not until the higher authorities urged the cleaning of the warehouse at the end of 1952 that it was discovered, otherwise it would have caused even greater losses.
    In addition, the Tianjin Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce and the Tianjin Trust Company should also bear certain responsibilities in this military rubber shoe deterioration incident. The Tianjin Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce had administrative leadership, policy transmission and other responsibilities for the Rubber Industry Association. At the beginning of this processing work, the bureau and Party A and Party B jointly organized a promotion group to ensure the quality of the products of each factory and the time to complete the task, but the heads of the general affairs, technology, and ingredient distribution groups under the promotion group were all private merchants, and the Administration for Industry and Commerce relaxed its leadership, so it became a legal tool for illegal capitalists to use shoddy materials. The Tianjin Trust Company was the supervising authority for this processing order, but it did not even review the specific agreement matters, did not look at the shoe samples, and sent a trainee, Li Juntao, to sign the agreement on behalf of the company, and never inspected the various factories afterwards. Now, the North China Administrative Committee People's Supervisory Committee is studying this illegal incident and will make a serious decision.

### 华北人民监察委员会协同有关机  关彻查天津橡胶厂偷工减料事件

    华北人民监察委员会协同有关机
    关彻查天津橡胶厂偷工减料事件
    【本报讯】华北行政委员会人民监察委员会，根据政务院人民监察委员会的指示，协同华北军区后勤军需生产部和中共天津市委会等机关，彻查了天津地方国营橡胶厂和部分私营厂商为志愿军加工制造军用胶鞋偷工减料的违法事件。彻查结果证实，这批加工制造的军用胶鞋约有五分之一发生海棉发粘，大底发硬、发黄、发粘、冒白蜡、起白霜，以及围条发黄等变质现象，其中有十万多双胶鞋全部报废（都是天津地方国营橡胶厂的出品）。只此一项，仅以工料费计算，就损失人民币十四亿多元。
    这一批军用胶鞋的加工制造，是志愿军后勤机关委托华北军区后勤军需生产部负责办理的。一九五一年十二月到一九五二年五月，华北军区后勤军需生产部工厂管理处和天津地方国营橡胶厂及裕蚨等二十四家私营橡胶厂，分两次签订了加工军用胶鞋的协议。天津地方国营橡胶厂承担的加工数量最大，应负军用胶鞋变质事件的主要责任。该厂总厂长史思良不把承制这批军用胶鞋当成光荣的政治任务，反而觉得“赚钱少，麻烦多”，对这一任务不重视，把它交给了该厂所属的一分厂。在布置任务时，他只召集了几个有关的负责干部开会，讲了一下任务、时间、技术和规格，连和军方签订的协议书也未交给一分厂。在整个制造过程中，他很少过问，没有作过检查。一分厂的领导干部也以同样不负责任的态度对待这一任务，副厂长刘桐未向职工进行必要的政治动员，掌握全厂技术工作的技师陈国钧更未积极地做好各种技术上的准备，便简单地命令开工。结果是操作方法上有许多错误，技术上发生了许多混乱现象，这是造成胶鞋变质的主要原因之一。如在制造第一批胶鞋中，工人王贵荣以为胶鞋大底后部较肥，不好与围条粘合，征得工长谢玉海同意，擅自将军方规定的大底样板后部磨去二糎，以致成品不合规格，九千双鞋被军方拒绝接收。又如在技术上没有标准办法，不是研究成熟后再行制造，而是一面试验，一面制造。以海棉配方为例，在八天内曾变动六次，在用料和用量上与标准配方出入很大，影响了成品的质量。特别是该厂为了单纯地追求成品数量，盲目地在硫化过程中增加鞋的数量，延长了硫化时间，以致造成硫化过度或硫化不足，发生了“海棉发粘”和“大底发硬”等变质现象。最不能容忍的是该厂曾两次以次料盗换军方的好胶。第一次，车间班长高玉昆，认为军方的三号生胶的质量较好，适于制做商品胶鞋的白围条，便向技师陈国钧提出，并在征得厂长孙允生同意后，用次胶盗换了好胶约五百公斤。陈国钧怕军方发觉，还嘱咐高玉昆要“保密”。第二次，另一工人以同样理由向陈国钧（此时已升为副厂长）提出，征得刘桐（此时已升为厂长）的同意，并在刘授意下请示过总厂长史思良，史的答复是：“如不影响军用胶鞋的质量，即可掉换。”结果又以三号胶盗换了军方的二号胶一千二百一十一公斤。这种偷盗行为，是造成成品含胶量不足的原因之一。经化验证明，成品的缺胶量为每百斤四点三二五至四点七五市斤。此外，该厂还以零碎鞋里布折换过军方的整布一百四十六码，总厂经营科长王世奇还挪用过军方的立德粉八百公斤、亚铅化八百公斤、笨油二千二百四十六公斤和铭黄、促进剂等物。
    天津地方国营橡胶厂一分厂这种违法行为已经不是第一次。早在一九五○年五月，为人民解放军某部加工制造胶鞋时，该厂前任厂长钟明欺侮军方没有检验员，曾暗中指示技师陈国钧，将大底前后宽度和围条长度各减一糎，获得非法利润两亿元。一九五一年八月，志愿军后勤机关委托华北军区后勤军需生产部向该厂加工制造棉鞋，原规定鞋的前部放毡，而该厂竟以劣等皮子和碎布代替。车间检验员魏树清认为这样做对不起志愿军，曾几次提出意见，都无结果。最后魏树清报告了军方检验人员，揭发了这种违法行为。该厂前任厂长钟明和副厂长刘桐，不仅不承认错误，反而对魏大加训斥，并逼他承认不维护厂方“利益”的错误。最后，魏竟被调离该厂，不准再做检验工作。
    华北军区后勤军需生产部这次负责承办胶鞋加工任务的干部，没有从北京、天津、青岛三市雨衣事件（关于这一事件的消息见一九五一年十二月十三日本报）中吸取教训，特别是没有把天津地方国营橡胶厂为志愿军加工制造棉鞋时违反规格的违法行为作前车之鉴，仍然采取了极端不负责任的官僚主义态度。该部工厂管理处处长张植臣，在进行第一批胶鞋加工时，没有认真地研究有关决定成品质量的许多重大问题，如“统一配方”、“配方标准”及如何进行监督检查等，便把这样重大的任务交给了业务科科员苏若愚，并对苏说：“协议书和合同，只要科里签字即可，不必经过处长。”他在草率地交代任务后，就从未进行过检查。直到军用胶鞋变质事件发生，两批成品全部入库后，该处才与厂方补签合同。直接负责这一加工工作的苏若愚，同样极端不负责任。他把“标准配方”交由私营义堂橡胶厂拟定，而且未经公营技术人员研究，只经后勤军需生产部和天津市工商管理局及橡胶业同业公会联合组成的推动小组的技术组草率审查修订后，便作为合法的标准去施行。这一“标准配方”有许多规定都不合理，没有规定“再生胶”含胶量，对成品的物理性能要求过低。华北军区后勤军需生产部也没有按照这一“标准配方”检查各厂执行的情况，甚至连统一的配方存据都没有。这种严重的失职行为，使得天津地方国营橡胶厂和私营厂商敢于放肆地偷工减料，盗窃国家财产，不按合同办事。经化验证明，私营裕蚨橡胶厂在每百斤生胶用量内，就偷减了二十斤。在成品的包装和保管上也很不负责任。胶鞋的包装本应用木箱，但因嫌麻烦，便以麻袋代替，加速了胶鞋的变质。同样的成品，木箱包装的只有百分之三十发生变质现象，而麻袋包装变质的在百分之九十八以上。该部所属的天津新仓库的领导人，没有接受过去因保管不周而发生胶鞋流胶的教训，仍然按照过去的办法，把这批军用胶鞋当做一般物资来保管，而且在保管方法上和设备上都有许多不合理的现象。这些也在一定程度上加速了胶鞋的变质。该库虽定有每月检查一次的制度，但是流于形式，因而大批军用胶鞋变质，长期没有发觉；直到一九五二年年底，由上级督促清理仓库时才发现，否则会造成更大的损失。
    此外，在这次军用胶鞋变质事件中，天津市工商管理局和天津市信托公司都应负一定责任。天津市工商局对橡胶同业公会负有行政领导、传达政策等责任。在这次加工工作开始时，该局曾与甲、乙双方联合组织了一个推动小组，以保证各厂产品的质量和完成任务的时间，但推动小组下设的总务、技术、配料等各组的组长都为私商，加以工商局又放松了领导，因此成了不法资本家偷工减料的合法工具。天津市信托公司是此次加工订货的监督机关，但连具体协议事项也没有审查，鞋样也没有看，就派练习生李均陶代表公司在协议书上签了字，而且以后从未对各厂进行过检查。现在，华北行政委员会人民监察委员会对这一违法事件正在进行研究，将作出严肃处理。
