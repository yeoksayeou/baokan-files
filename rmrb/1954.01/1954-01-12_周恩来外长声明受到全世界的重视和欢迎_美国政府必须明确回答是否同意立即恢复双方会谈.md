Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: The Korean-Chinese side has made another significant effort to resume the bilateral talks regarding the political conference issue, which were unilaterally interrupted by the U.S. side. In the face of the efforts of the Korean-Chinese side, the U.S. government, which has been constantly promoting its willingness to resume talks, is facing a new test.

In a statement issued on the 9th by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, he firmly advocated the immediate resumption of bilateral talks to quickly arrange the convening of the Korean political conference. The statement said: "If the U.S. government has the same desire for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it should agree to immediately resume the bilateral talks at Panmunjom."

Minister Zhou Enlai's statement opened the door for the immediate resumption of bilateral talks and made it possible to ease the current serious situation in Korea. It is entirely understandable that the world attaches great importance to and welcomes this statement. The Associated Press reported that "allied diplomatic officials" in Washington believed that "conditions are ripe for a speedy resumption of the Panmunjom talks to arrange the Korean peace conference." According to Agence France-Presse, British "authoritative sources" stated that the British government "urgently hopes to expedite" the resumption of bilateral talks; UN personnel also believe that this statement "shows that Communist China deeply hopes to resume the Panmunjom talks to arrange the Korean political conference."

However, this statement is obviously not a pleasant thing for the U.S. government. The U.S. government has repeatedly claimed recently that it is willing to resume bilateral talks, and even spread the lie that it has negotiated with the Korean-Chinese side through intermediaries. Now Minister Zhou Enlai's statement has pushed the U.S. government into a corner. The U.S. government must either agree to immediately resume the talks, or show that all the optimistic air it has spread is just a trick to deceive public opinion.

From many indications, the U.S. government still has no intention of immediately resuming bilateral talks, lest its plan to forcibly detain Korean-Chinese prisoners of war on January 22 be hindered. U.S. State Department officials have taken an extremely frivolous attitude toward Minister Zhou Enlai's such an important statement, attempting to dismiss it as "another communist propaganda" and dismiss it in one stroke. The Associated Press reported: "Some people in the State Department are firmly opposed to holding negotiations to arrange a peace conference before January 23. They believe that would only give the communists another forum to insist on their demands: they must be given an eighty-day extension of the explanation period."

It is obvious that the U.S. government's release of its willingness to immediately resume bilateral talks is nothing more than to paralyze the attention of people around the world to the evolution of the Korean situation, and to ease their dissatisfaction with the U.S. government, which unreasonably undermines bilateral talks. There are reports that the U.S. government released this kind of air, and its purpose is also to use this to block the convening of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Korean issue, so as to avoid embarrassing itself there again, and at the same time, it also wants to avoid the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference from leading to a five-power conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China. But no matter what the original intention of the United States is, it is not enough for the U.S. government to just release air now. It must now immediately and clearly answer this question to the world: Is it willing to immediately resume bilateral talks, or does it refuse to immediately resume talks and make it impossible for the Korean issue to be resolved peacefully.

### 周恩来外长声明受到全世界的重视和欢迎  美国政府必须明确回答是否同意立即恢复双方会谈

    周恩来外长声明受到全世界的重视和欢迎
    美国政府必须明确回答是否同意立即恢复双方会谈
    【新华社开城十日电】本社特派记者江南报道：朝中方面为了恢复被美方片面中断的关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，又作了一次重大的努力。在朝中方面的努力面前，最近不断宣传愿意恢复会谈的美国政府正在受到新的考验。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长在九日发表的声明中，坚决主张立即恢复双方会谈，以迅速安排朝鲜政治会议的召开。声明说：“倘若美国政府对于和平解决朝鲜问题具有同样愿望，它就应该赞成立即恢复板门店的双方会谈。”
    周恩来部长的声明为立即恢复双方会谈打开了大门，并且使缓和目前朝鲜的严重局势成为可能。全世界对于这个声明表示十分重视和欢迎，这是完全可以理解的。合众社报道说，在华盛顿的美国的
  “盟国外交官员”认为：“从速恢复安排朝鲜和平会议的板门店谈判的条件已经成熟了。”据法新社报道，英国“权威人士”表示，英国政府“急切地希望尽速”恢复双方会谈；联合国人士也认为，这个声明“表示出共产党中国深切希望恢复安排朝鲜政治会议的板门店谈判的迹象”。
    但是这个声明对于美国政府说来，显然并不是什么愉快的事情。美国政府最近一再宣传说它愿意恢复双方会谈，甚至散布它已经通过中间人和朝中方面谈判的谎言。现在周恩来部长的声明把美国政府逼到了墙角落里。美国政府要就是同意立即恢复会谈，要就是表明它所散布的乐观空气都只不过是欺骗舆论的把戏。
    从许多迹象看来，美国政府仍然无意立即恢复双方会谈，以免它的在一月二十二日强迫扣留朝中被俘人员的计划受到妨碍。美国国务院的官员们对于周恩来部长的如此重要的声明采取了极不郑重的态度，企图把它说成是“又一个共方的宣传”而加以一笔抹煞。美联社报道说：“国务院的某些人士坚决反对在一月二十三日之前举行安排和平会议的谈判。他们认为：那样只能给予共方另一个讲坛，供他们去坚持他们的主张：必须给他们八十天的延长解释期限。”
    很明显，美国政府散放它愿意立即恢复双方会谈的空气，其目的无非是为了麻痹全世界人民对于朝鲜局势演变的注意，缓和他们对于无理地破坏双方会谈的美国政府的不满。有消息说，美国政府散放这种空气，其目的还在于想借此挡开召开联合国大会来讨论朝鲜问题，以免它自己又在那里出丑，同时还想避免柏林四国外长会议导向有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议。但是无论美国的本意如何，美国政府现在仅仅散放空气是不够的了。它现在必须马上明确地向全世界回答这个问题：它愿意立即恢复双方会谈呢，还是拒绝立即恢复会谈而使朝鲜问题不能获得和平解决。
