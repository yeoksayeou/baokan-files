(Xinhua News Agency, 4th) TASS reports: Soviet food production saw great development in 1953 and will be further expanded in 1954.

In 1953, the output of various enterprises in the Soviet food industry increased by more than 12% compared to 1952. Compared to 1950, the production of high-quality flour-based long bread and rolls has more than doubled, and pasta and pastries have almost doubled. Butter has almost doubled compared to the pre-war year of 1940, while sour cream, cottage cheese, and cream have increased by more than 80%. The production of meat, confectionery, liquor, and other items has increased rapidly. Compared to 1952, biscuit production increased by 33%, chocolate candy by 26%, wine by 5 million decaliters, and black caviar by nearly 50%. The development of food production in the Baltic republics is particularly remarkable. After the Second World War, fruit and vegetable canned goods in Estonia's food production have increased twentyfold compared to 1946, sausages fivefold compared to pre-war levels, and confectionery fivefold compared to 1938. In the past year, a large number of food industry enterprises have been built across the country according to needs and conditions. In 1953 alone, more than 100 newly built oil mills and cheese factories were completed. Georgia, the main tea-producing area in the Soviet Union, built and expanded 15 tea processing factories. Food enterprises across the country have been equipped with the latest machinery. In the past year, 15,000 new machines and mechanical equipment were installed, including more than 700 continuous production devices and combined machines, and more than 1,000 automatic machines.

This year, the scale of Soviet food production will be further expanded. According to the plan, in 1954 the Soviet Union will allocate 8.5 billion rubles for the construction of food enterprises, which is equal to the total of the appropriations in 1951 and 1952. The funding for the meat industry will be twice that of 1953. Many new giant factories will be built. For example, a meat factory under construction in Moscow, once put into production, can produce about 300 tons of canned meat, sausages and smoked meat, one million fried cutlets, 60,000 kilograms of meat dumplings, and 40,000 cans of delicious meat in a single day. It is estimated that due to the construction and renovation of food enterprises in the Uzbek Republic, the output of semi-finished meat products in 1954 will increase to 6.4 times that of 1950, cheese 5.2 times, canned fish 4.1 times, pastries 3 times, meat 2.6 times, and animal oil 2.45 times.

    苏联拨出巨款扩大食品工业
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联食品生产在一九五三年有了很大发展，一九五四年将进一步扩大。
    在一九五三年，苏联食品工业各企业的产量比一九五二年增加了百分之十二以上。和一九五○年相比，上等面粉作的长面包、小面包等已增为两倍多，面食点心几乎增为两倍。奶油几乎增为战前一九四零年的两倍，酸奶油、牛奶渣和乳脂增加了百分之八十以上。肉类、糖果、酒类等的生产增加得很快。和一九五二年相比，饼干的生产增加了百分之三十三，巧克力糖增加了百分之二十六，葡萄酒增加了五百万公斗，黑鱼子酱增加了将近百分之五十。波罗的海沿岸各共和国的食品生产的发展极为显著。第二次世界大战后，爱沙尼亚的食品生产中果类蔬菜罐头已增为一九四六年的二十倍，香肠类增为战前的五倍，糖果点心增为一九三八年的五倍。在过去一年中，全国各地都按照需要和条件兴建了大批的食品工业企业。单是在一九五三年新建成的榨油厂和乳酪厂就有一百多个。苏联主要产茶区格鲁吉亚就建造和扩充了十五个进行茶叶加工的工厂。各地的食品企业都安装了最新式的机器。过去一年中，新装的机器和机械共达一万五千部，其中包括七百多部连续生产装置和联动机，一千多部自动机器。
    今年苏联食品生产的规模将更加扩大。根据计划，一九五四年苏联拨作建造食品企业的款项将达八十五亿卢布，等于一九五一年和一九五二年拨款的总和。肉类工业的经费将为一九五三年的两倍。许多新的巨型工厂将建立起来。例如莫斯科正在建筑的一座肉类工厂在投入生产以后，一天之中就可生产约三百吨罐头肉类、腊肠和熏肉，一百万块炸肉排，六万公斤肉馅饺子和四万罐美味肉类。预计乌兹别克共和国由于新建和改建了食品企业，一九五四年肉类半制品的产量将增为一九五○年的六点四倍，乳酪五点二倍，鱼类罐头四点一倍，点心三倍，肉类二点六倍，动物油二点四五倍。
