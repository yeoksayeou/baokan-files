Brave and Diligent Korean People

A Heroic Combat Engineer

The event occurred one day in July. The Korean People's Army's tank units, providing cover for the infantry, broke through the Kum River defense line and continued to advance south. The enemy, while retreating, destroyed bridges and laid mines along the way, attempting to hinder the People's Army's pursuit. At this time, a combat engineer ran ahead of the tanks, repeatedly searching for mines with a mine detector. As he approached a small bridge, he suddenly discovered that the enemy had planted many anti-tank mines there. The combat engineer began to dig quickly. He had barely dug halfway when the sound of tank engines roared from behind. Anxiously, he ran to the bridgehead and shouted loudly, "Hey! Tanks, stop! There are mines here..." However, the tank crew did not hear his shouts and continued to drive forward. He hurriedly gave signals, but the tanks still did not stop. Seeing that the tank was about to hit the mines, he turned around, shouted "Long Live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!" and lunged toward the mines. There was a deafening roar. The tanks stopped immediately, and the tank crew got out to investigate. When they found a tattered military cap with a red star, they understood everything. Everyone silently lowered their heads to pay their respects to this glorious comrade.

The gunner carefully placed the heroic combat engineer's tattered cap in his pocket and then, with his comrades, jumped back onto the tank. The tanks rumbled forward again, advancing along the path cleared by the life of the combat engineer, continuing south in pursuit of the enemy.

An Heroic Assault Captain

On June 1st last year, during the battle for Height 811.7, in which a unit of the Korean People's Army attacked, Quan Jinghuan served as the assault captain.

The battle began, and the assault troops, under the cover of intense artillery fire from the People's Army, charged towards the enemy's position. Quan Jinghuan led the assault team, quickly clearing the mines on the road ahead.

As they crossed the rocky heights, taking advantage of the light from enemy flares, they saw many enemy firing points furiously spitting flames. Thereupon, Quan Jinghuan shouted to everyone, "Comrades! If we don't eliminate these firing points, our troops cannot advance! Destroy them! Comrades, follow me!" Shouting, he charged towards the enemy firing points. Braving the rain of bullets, he stuck close to the firing points' blind spots and quickly threw grenades into them. With a bang, the firing points immediately fell silent. Next, he continuously destroyed several more enemy firing points, eliminating more than fifty enemies. At this time, the warriors of the People's Army assault troops also shouted "Long Live" as they charged forward.

Quan Jinghuan was therefore awarded the title of "Hero of the Republic".

Safe Driving for 100,000 Kilometers

In the ranks of the Korean People's Army's drivers, there are ten "Heroes of the Republic". Huang Yize is one of the most outstanding among them. During the war, he overcame all difficulties and successfully completed every transportation mission, creating a record of 100,000 kilometers of safe driving.

One day in May 1951, after completing a transportation task on the Eastern Front, he was resting in the forest when eight enemy planes suddenly appeared and carried out a frenzied bombing and strafing of the forest. At this time, some of the more than fifty trucks of the Korean and Chinese troops parked in the forest had already been hit and were engulfed in flames. The situation was extremely urgent. Huang Yize quickly ran to his truck and rescued it. Only then did he discover that the steering wheel was soaked in blood, and he had been wounded in three places. But disregarding the pain of his wounds, he rushed into the fire again and rescued three more trucks, two of which belonged to the Chinese People's Volunteers. Inspired by him, all the drivers quickly rescued their vehicles.

Created a High-Yield Record

Yu Wanyu is an ordinary rural woman. During the war, sixteen members of her family were killed by the American invaders. Hatred for the enemy left her with only one wish: to strive for a good harvest to support the war. She cultivated more than one hectare of paddy fields herself, achieving a good harvest every year. In 1951, she harvested 9.98 tons of rice per hectare, and that year she donated two and a half tons of patriotic rice. In 1952, she strove for another good harvest and donated another four tons of patriotic rice. Therefore, Yu Wanyu successively received the "Third-Class National Flag Medal" and the "Second-Class National Flag Medal". As a result, the farmers in Yule Village all learned from her and competed with her.

On New Year's Day last year, Yu Wanyu and the members of the high-yield competition group she led decided that the production target for 1953 would be double that of 1952. Before the thaw, they had made all kinds of preparations. On March 20th, they carried out the first sowing. When the rice transplanting season arrived, Yu Wanyu began transplanting the rice seedlings first. After the seedlings grew, she carried out seven weeding operations in the fields. When the news of the Korean armistice came, the vast rice fields of Yule Village rippled with green waves, and the farmers greeted this victory with the impending harvest.

During the autumn harvest season, Yu Wanyu finally achieved her planned high-yield target - harvesting nineteen tons of rice per hectare, creating a high-yield record that was one of the best in the country. The total output of Yule Village also increased by 20 to 30 percent compared to 1952.

    勇敢勤劳的朝鲜人民
    一个英雄的工兵
    事情发生在七月里的某天。朝鲜人民军的坦克部队掩护着步兵，突破锦江防线，继续向南推进。敌人一面溃退，一面沿途破坏桥梁，埋设地雷，企图阻碍人民军的追击。这时，一个工兵跑在坦克的前面，用地雷探测器反复地寻找地雷。当他走到一座小桥附近的时候，忽然发现敌人在那里埋下许多反坦克地雷。这个工兵就开始迅速挖掘，刚挖了一半，坦克的马达声就从背后响起来了。他急得跑到桥头上大声喊叫：“喂！坦克快停下来！这里有地雷……”可是，坦克手并没有听到他的喊声，仍然向这里开过来。他又赶忙放信号，可是坦克仍然没有停下来。眼看坦克就要碰上地雷了，这时，他调转身子，高呼“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！”就向地雷扑去。只听得轰然一声巨响。坦克急忙停了，坦克手们下来四处查看，当他们发现了一顶残破的还缀着红星的军帽时，这才明白了一切，大家都默默地垂下头来，向这位光荣的战友致敬。
    炮长把这个英雄工兵的残破的军帽收藏在衣袋里，然后又和战友们一起跳上坦克。坦克又隆隆地前进了，他们越过一个工兵用生命开辟的道路，继续向南挺进，追击敌人。
    英勇的突击队长
    去年六月一日，在朝鲜人民军某部袭击八一一点七高地的战斗中，全景焕担任了突击队长。
    战斗开始了，袭击部队在人民军强烈的炮火掩护中，向着敌人的阵地冲去，全景焕带领着突击队员们，在迅速清除前进道路上的地雷。
    他们在越过岩石高地的时候，趁着敌人投下的照明弹的亮光，看到敌人的许多火力点正疯狂地向外吐着火舌。于是，全景焕向大家喊道：“同志们！不消灭这个火力点，我们的部队就不能前进！炸毁它！同志们，跟我来！”他喊着就向敌人的火力点冲去。他冒着弹雨，紧贴着火力点的死角，迅速地把手榴弹扔进火力点里去，轰地一声，这个火力点立刻变成了哑巴。接着，他又连续炸毁敌人的好几处火力点，消灭了五十多个敌人。这时人民军袭击部队的勇士们也高呼着“万岁”冲上来了。
    全景焕因而获得了“共和国英雄”的称号。
    安全行车十万公里
    在朝鲜人民军汽车司机的行列里，有十名“共和国英雄”，黄义泽就是其中出色的一个。在战争期间，他克服一切困难每次都胜利完成了运输任务，创造了安全行车十万公里的纪录。
    一九五一年五月某天，他在完成东线的一次运输任务后，正躺在丛林里休息，八架敌机突然飞来，对丛林进行了疯狂的轰炸和扫射。这时，停在丛林中的朝中部队的五十多辆卡车，有一部分已经被炸中，冒着熊熊的火焰。情况非常紧急。黄义泽就飞快跑到自己的汽车上，把它抢救出来；这时他才发现驾驶盘上浸遍了血迹，身上三处负伤了，但他不顾伤口的疼痛，又冲进大火中抢救出三辆汽车，其中有两辆是中国人民志愿军的。在他的鼓舞下，所有司机都迅速地把自己的车抢救出来了。
    创造了丰产高纪录
    俞万玉是个普通的农村妇女，在战争期间，她家十六口人都被美国侵略者杀死了。对敌人的仇恨，使她只有一个愿望，争取丰收，支援战争。她自己种了一公顷多水地，年年都是丰收。一九五一年她在每公顷土地上打了九吨又九百八十公斤稻子，那年她曾捐了两吨半爱国米；一九五二年她又争取了丰收，又捐了四吨爱国米。因此，俞万玉连续获得了“三级国旗勋章”和“二级国旗勋章”。于是，鱼勒里的农民们都向她学习和她竞赛了。
    去年元旦，俞万玉和她所领导的丰产竞赛组的组员们，决定一九五三年的生产目标为一九五二年的两倍。解冻以前，他们已作好了各种准备。三月二十日，他们进行了第一次播种。插秧时期到了，俞万玉最先开始了插秧。等秧苗长出来以后，她又在田里进行了七次锄草工作。朝鲜停战消息传来的时候，鱼勒里的广大稻田上荡漾着绿色的波浪，农民们用即将到来的丰收迎接着这一胜利。
    秋收时节，俞万玉终于达到了预定的丰产目标——在每公顷土地上收获了十九吨稻子。创造了在全国也是数一数二的丰产纪录。全鱼勒里的产量也比一九五二年增加了百分之二十到三十。
