Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: In 1953, the Soviet Union successfully carried out large-scale housing construction. The Soviet government allocated four times more funds for housing construction in 1953 than in the pre-war year of 1940. Factories manufacturing prefabricated houses supplied prefabricated houses with a total construction area of 1.6 million square meters to residents. In the Russian Federation and Moscow, new houses were completed every day. In 1953, Moscow workers obtained new houses with a construction area of approximately 800,000 square meters. In the Stalinino Oblast, the center of the Donets Coal Region, new houses with a total construction area of more than 300,000 square meters were built in 1953. Workers in Sverdlovsk received more than 4,000 apartment buildings. A new residential area appeared in the northern suburbs of Kazan, the capital of the Tatar Autonomous Republic, with streets stretching for several kilometers. New houses were completed almost every day in the textile center of Ivanovo; 43 new houses were completed in the last three weeks of 1953 alone; currently, more than 150 new buildings are under construction. Volga City, the new city for the builders of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, had not yet appeared on the map, but 100,000 square meters of houses were also completed in 1953. At the same time, 63,000 apartment buildings in the Russian Federation were equipped with gas facilities in 1953. Currently, more than 400,000 apartment buildings in Moscow have gas facilities, and more than 200,000 households and many nurseries and schools in Leningrad use gas. Gas networks have also been expanded in other cities of the Russian Federation, such as Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, Ufa, and Saratov.

In the past year, a large number of apartment buildings have also been built in other Soviet republics. In Minsk, the capital of the Byelorussian Republic, a new house appeared every other day. More than 100 large residential buildings were built in Kharkiv, Ukrainian Republic; In 1953, more than 40,000 apartment buildings in the entire republic were equipped with gas facilities. Several thousand new houses appeared in Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Republic, in 1953, and 5,000 houses are still under construction. The streets of Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh Republic, are dotted with beautiful new houses; In the past year, 200 houses alone have been built for railway workers, machine manufacturing workers and other enterprise workers. The Turkmen Republic built more than 100 new houses and cultural and welfare institutions for oil workers; Teregen Island, which was a sun-scorched and waterless land two years ago, now has entire districts of well-built new houses, and the workers at the island's oil fields have obtained houses with a construction area of more than 14,000 square meters.

The scale of Soviet housing construction will be further expanded in 1954. Minsk, the capital of the Byelorussian Republic, plans to build 326 large apartment buildings this year, and the residential building area will be doubled compared to 1953. According to the overall renovation plan for Moscow, two million square meters of residential buildings will be built this year in the southwestern district of Moscow, near Moscow University.

    苏联全国各地建成大批新住宅
    【新华社十日讯】一九五三年，苏联胜利地进行了大规模的住宅建设工作。苏联政府在一九五三年拨出的住宅建筑费，为战前一九四○年的四倍。制造预装配房屋的工厂供给了居民一百六十万平方公尺建筑面积的预装配房屋。在俄罗斯联邦、莫斯科每天都有新的住宅落成，一九五三年莫斯科劳动者获得了建筑面积约为八十万平方公尺的新住宅。顿尼兹煤区中心斯大林诺州，一九五三年筑成了共达三十多万平方公尺建筑面积的新住宅。斯维德洛夫斯克的劳动者得到了四千多幢公寓房屋。鞑靼自治共和国首都喀山的北郊区出现了一个新住宅区，这个区的大街长达几公里。纺织中心伊凡诺佛城几乎每天都有新房屋落成，仅在一九五三年最后三个星期中就落成了四十三幢新住宅；目前还有一百五十多幢新建筑在施工中。斯大林格勒水电站建筑者的新城——伏尔加城在地图上还没有出现，一九五三年也建成了十万平方公尺建筑面积的房屋。和这同时，俄罗斯联邦在一九五三年中又有六万三千幢公寓房屋安装了煤气设备。目前莫斯科有四十多万幢公寓房屋有煤气设备，列宁格勒有二十万以上的住户和许多托儿所、学校使用煤气。俄罗斯联邦其他城市如古比雪夫、斯大林格勒、乌法、萨拉托夫等城市的煤气网也扩大了。
    在过去一年中，苏联其他加盟共和国也兴建了大批公寓房屋。白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克每隔一天就有一幢新房屋出现。乌克兰共和国的哈尔科夫市建造了一百多幢大住宅；在一九五三年全共和国有四万多幢公寓房屋安装了煤气设备。亚美尼亚共和国首都埃里温在一九五三年中出现了几千幢新住宅，现在还有五千幢住宅在建筑中。哈萨克共和国首都阿拉木图的街道上到处点缀着漂亮的新房屋；在过去一年中，单是为铁路工人、机器制造工人和其他企业工人建筑的房屋就有二百多幢。土库曼共和国为石油工人建造了一百多幢新住宅和文化福利机关；捷列根岛在两年前本是一片被太阳晒焦了的无水的土地，现在出现了整区整区的建筑优良的新房屋，岛上油场的工人得到了一万四千多平方公尺建筑面积的住宅。
    一九五四年苏联房屋建筑的规模将进一步扩大。白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克今年计划要建筑三百二十六幢大公寓房屋，住宅建筑面积将增为一九五三年的两倍。按莫斯科改建总计划规定，今年莫斯科西南区莫斯科大学附近将兴建两百万平方公尺建筑面积的住宅。
