　　Molotov's Speech Attracts Attention from News Circles of Various Countries
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 26th (TASS dispatch): "Pravda" special correspondent O. Orestov cabled from Berlin, commenting on the opening of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

He wrote: V.M. Molotov's speech aroused great interest among many reporters who came to Berlin from all over the world. It is noteworthy that after the meeting, spokespersons of the Western countries' delegations immediately issued statements to the press, attempting to prove that Molotov's speech "contained nothing new," while at the same time avoiding any summary or analysis of its most important propositions.

However, after seeing the full text of Molotov's speech distributed by the Soviet news agency, many reporters privately expressed great interest in the specific proposals of the Soviet delegation regarding the agenda. They pointed out that the Soviet attitude undoubtedly proceeds from the interests of world peace and universal security.

Many reporters emphasized in private conversations that whether the major issues of maintaining international peace and security can be satisfactorily resolved largely depends on the participation of the five major powers, including the People's Republic of China, in discussing these issues.

On January 25th, some reporters mentioned the recent words of Sir Pierson Dixon, the British representative to the United Nations. Dixon said that China should be allowed to attend the United Nations in the near future. The "Economist" magazine in London then argued with Dixon, but in the end, it had to admit that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to solve pressing international problems, let alone the problems of Asia and the Pacific.

　　“真理报”特派记者评论四国外长会议的开幕
　　莫洛托夫的发言引起各国新闻界的注意
    【新华社二十七日讯】　据塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：“真理报”特派记者奥·奥列斯托夫自柏林来电，评论四国外长会议的开幕。
    他写道：维·米·莫洛托夫的发言引起了自世界各地来到柏林的许多记者的极大兴趣。值得注意的是：在会后，西方国家代表团发言人立即向报界发表声明，企图证明莫洛托夫的发言“没有什么新的内容”，而同时又躲避对其中最重要的主张作任何概述或分析。
    但是许多记者在看到了苏联新闻机构分发的莫洛托夫的发言全文后，私下表示对苏联代表团关于议程的具体建议有极大兴趣。他们指出：苏联的态度无疑是从世界和平与普遍安全的利益出发的。
    许多记者在私下谈话中着重指出：关于维持国际和平与安全的主要问题是否能够圆满解决，在很大程度上决定于五大国，包括中华人民共和国，全都参加会议来讨论这些问题。
    在一月二十五日，记者中有人提到英国驻联合国代表杰伯最近的话。杰伯说，应该在最近的将来让中国出席联合国。伦敦的“经济学家”周刊接着就与杰伯争论起来，但是，它最后也不得不承认：没有中华人民共和国参加，不可能解决迫切的国际问题，更不用谈亚洲与太平洋的问题了。
