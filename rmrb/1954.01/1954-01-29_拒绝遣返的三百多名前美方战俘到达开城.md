Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 28th: This afternoon, 347 former American, British, and South Korean prisoners of war who refused repatriation arrived in Kaesong as free men on brightly decorated trucks from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custody camp. The thirty-five trucks, carrying these waving and cheering men, drove through crowds of men, women, and children who welcomed them along the northern edge of the demilitarized zone.

The POWs were up before dawn to greet this momentous day in their lives. Otto Bell of Olympia, Washington, said, "We didn't sleep well last night. We were too excited at the thought of being free in a few hours." They were neatly dressed in clean blue uniforms, freshly barbered and shaved, waiting for the DPRK Red Cross trucks to take them to Kaesong. Rufus Douglas of San Angelo, Texas, put on a new pair of shoes he had been saving for months for this day.

When the Red Cross trucks arrived, they came out of their rooms with heavy bedrolls and luggage, carrying bags, and loaded boxes of books, sports equipment, and musical instruments onto the trucks. Some of them carried luggage for four Korean women, letting these women take care of a few oil paintings.

Another group of Americans and Koreans tied flags to the trucks and hung colorful streamers all over them. On top of the driver's seat were paper reproductions of the emblem of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and cotton Picasso peace doves.

While waiting for the Indian Red Cross representatives to hand over their rosters to the representatives of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross, these Americans and Koreans sang songs composed by Korean musicians in the POW camp in front of the large mess hall with its wooden plank cover. At the repeated request of the Koreans, William White, a black American from Kansas City, Montana, stepped forward and sang a Chinese folk song in Korean with his loud voice. Three other good singers, Cowart from Monticello, Arkansas, Adams from Memphis, Tennessee, and Skinner from Akron, Ohio, also sang some Korean songs for everyone. The camp was filled with applause and shouts of "Encore!"

Dozens of journalists, including reporters and photographers from the Associated Press, International News Service, and Agence France-Presse, as well as Indian journalists, entered the camp to interview the POWs and watch them leave. The reporters mingled with the POWs and talked to them casually. Beholm of Ashland, Pennsylvania, asked a reporter from the International News Service, "Do you believe now that we are staying voluntarily?" The American reporter replied, "I do." An Indian reporter commented, "There is no comparison between here and the South Camp."

On the way to Kaesong, these Americans, British, and Koreans were constantly smiling, cheering, singing, and waving to passersby and crowds standing in the streets. Generals Li Sang-cho and Du Ping, representing the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army respectively, welcomed them to Kaesong as free men. Upon arriving in Kaesong, Cordon of Providence, Rhode Island, speaking on behalf of twenty-one Americans and one Briton, said, "This is the happiest and most historic moment of our lives. We are finally free men."

　　拒绝遣返的三百多名前美方战俘到达开城
    【新华社开城二十八日电】二十八日下午，三百四十七名拒绝遣返的美国、英国和南朝鲜前战俘，自中立国遣返委员会看管营地以自由人的身份乘着装饰漂亮的卡车到开城来了。三十五辆卡车载着这些挥手欢呼的人，在非军事区北缘附近夹道欢迎的男女和儿童群中驶过。
    战俘们为了迎接他们一生中的这个重大的日子，天不亮就起来了。华盛顿州奥林比亚的奥托·贝尔说：“我们昨夜没有睡好。我们一想到在几小时后可以获得自由时就激动得不得了。”他们身穿干净的蓝色制服，刚理了发和刮了脸，样子很整洁，等待着朝中红十字会的卡车来把他们送到开城去。得克萨斯州圣安格罗的鲁弗斯·道格拉斯穿上了他为这一天而保藏了好几个月的一双新鞋。
    当红十字会的卡车到达时，他们便掮着沉重的铺盖卷和行李，手拿着袋子，从他们的屋子里走出来，并把一箱一箱的书籍、体育用品和乐器装上卡车。他们之中有些人替四名朝鲜妇女拿行李，只让这些妇女照顾几张油画。
    另外一批美国人和朝鲜人把旗帜扎在卡车上，并在卡车的各处地方挂满了五颜六色的纸带。在驾驶座的顶上装有纸做的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国徽和用棉花做的毕加索的和平鸽。
    在等待印度红十字会代表把他们的名册移交给朝中红十字会的代表时，这些美国人和朝鲜人一起在木板盖的大饭厅前面合唱朝鲜音乐家在战俘营中所创作的歌曲。在朝鲜人的再三要求下，蒙大拿州堪萨斯城的美国黑人威廉·怀特走到中央，以他那响亮的歌喉用朝鲜文唱了一支中国民歌。另外三个唱得好的人，阿肯色州蒙特塞罗的科华特、田纳西州孟菲斯的亚当斯、俄亥俄州阿克伦的斯金纳，也向大家唱了一些朝鲜歌。营场中充满了掌声和“再来一遍”的叫喊声。
    数十名记者，包括美联社、国际新闻社和法新社的记者和摄影记者以及印度记者，进入营场访问这些战俘，并看他们离开营场。记者们混杂在战俘中随便和他们交谈。宾夕法尼亚州阿什兰的贝霍姆问一个国际新闻社的记者说，“你现在相信了我们是自愿留下的吗？”这个美国记者答道：“我相信了。”一位印度记者发表意见说：“这里和南营是不能相比的。”
    在开往开城的途中，这些美国人、英国人和朝鲜人一直是笑容满面，欢呼歌唱，并向路过的行人和站在街上的人群挥手示意。李相朝将军和杜平将军分别代表朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军欢迎他们作为自由人到达了开城。在到达开城时，罗得岛普罗维顿斯的柯敦代表二十一名美国人和一名英国人说道：“这是我们一生中最快乐的和最富有历史意义的一个时刻。我们终于是自由的人了。”
