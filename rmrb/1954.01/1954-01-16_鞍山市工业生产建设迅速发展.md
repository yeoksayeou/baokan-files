    The development of industrial production and construction in Anshan is very rapid. Taking the total industrial output value of 1949 as 100, it was 428.8 in 1950, 546.5 in 1951, and 781.7 in 1952. In the process of restoration and transformation over three years, industrial production increased nearly seven times. Last year—the first year of my country's first five-year plan—saw another increase of 47.2 percent (estimated completion) over the 1952 production level.
    Anshan is the focus of my country’s first five-year plan, and the development of basic construction is advancing by leaps and bounds. If the total project volume of the city in 1951 is 100, then it was 826 in 1952, and 2,566 last year. The rapid expansion of basic construction and the continuous commissioning of new and rebuilt factories have provided a reliable material guarantee for the continuous growth of industrial production. For example, after the large-scale rolling mill, seamless steel pipe plant, No. 7 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel, and the No. 8 blast furnace, which was put into operation in March last year, are officially put into production, Anshan's pig iron production capacity will increase by more than 60 percent, and the steel production capacity will increase by about 40 to 60 percent.
    In recent years, Anshan's state-owned industry has always occupied an absolute advantage and has become the basic force in the composition of the entire industry. In particular, the continuous development of Anshan Iron and Steel has enabled other industries to develop along with it. The proportion of various industrial components in 1953 was: state-owned, 95.29; cooperative-operated, 1.12; joint state-private, 0.32; private, 2.00; individual handicraft industry, 1.27. In recent years, both local state-owned industries and cooperative-operated industries have developed greatly. If the total local industry in 1953 is 100, then local state-owned accounts for 63.6, cooperative-operated accounts for 12.0, joint state-private accounts for 3.5, and private accounts for 20.9.

    鞍山市工业生产建设迅速发展
    鞍山市工业生产建设的发展十分迅速。以一九四九年工业总产值为一○○，一九五○年为四二八·八，一九五一年为五四六·五，一九五二年为七八一·七。在三年多的恢复和改造过程中，工业生产增加将近七倍。去年——我国第一个五年计划的第一年，又在一九五二年的生产水平上增长百分之四七·二（预计完成数）。
    鞍山是我国第一个五年计划的重点，基本建设的发展是突飞猛进的，如以一九五一年全市工程总量为一○○，则一九五二年为八二六，去年则为二、五六六。基本建设的迅速扩展，新建和改建的工厂不断投入生产，使工业生产的不断增长有了可靠的物质保证。如鞍钢大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第七号炼铁炉和去年三月投入生产的第八号炼铁炉正式投入生产后，将使鞍山的生铁生产能力提高百分之六十以上，钢材的生产能力提高百分之四十到六十左右。
    几年来鞍山国营工业一直是占着绝对优势，成为全部工业组成的基本力量，特别是鞍钢的不断发展，才使得其他工业随着发展起来。一九五三年各种工业成份所占比重是：国营为九五·二九，合作社营为一·一二，公私合营为○·三二，私营为二·○○，个体手工业为一·二七。几年来地方国营工业和合作社营工业都有很大发展，一九五三年全部地方工业为一○○，则地方国营占六三·六，合作社营占一二·○，公私合营占三·五，私营占二○·九。
