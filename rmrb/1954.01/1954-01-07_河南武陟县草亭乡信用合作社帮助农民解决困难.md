    The Caoting Township Credit Cooperative in Wuzhi County, Henan Province, has won the love of farmers and developed its business by helping farmers solve their production and livelihood difficulties.
    In the two years since its establishment, the Caoting Township Credit Cooperative has absorbed 675.8 million yuan of idle funds from farmers. It has used these funds to help local farmers buy 101 head of livestock, exchange 122 small livestock for large livestock, buy 108 pieces of plows, seeders, and harrows, build 80 houses, buy and repair 8 carts each, and solve the economic difficulties encountered by many farmers in weddings, funerals, illnesses, and various accidents.
    The Caoting Township Credit Cooperative has also used its economic strength to consolidate and develop farmers' mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The Wang Shihou mutual aid group in the township could not solve the problem of exchanging labor for animal power due to the lack of livestock. Some members did not want to help each other anymore. Later, because they received help from the credit cooperative and bought a head of livestock, they had public livestock, and everyone was more enthusiastic about mutual aid. Farmer Yuan Ruyun and some farmers whose fields were connected to his organized a mutual aid group after receiving help from the credit cooperative to dig a well.
    Under the long-term influence of the credit cooperative, farmers in this township have developed the habit of saving. Farmer Wang Wanjin sold a batch of old cypress wood that he had saved for more than 20 years for 2 million yuan and deposited it in the credit cooperative. He said he wanted to turn "dead money into live money." Farmer Chen Lingfu used to buy grain and store it when he had money. Three hundred catties rotted two years ago. Last year, after harvesting wheat, he sold 1,500 catties of wheat and deposited the money in the credit cooperative. Farmer Ma Laibi had a surplus of 450,000 yuan, and spent 50,000 yuan in ten days at home. He said: "It's easy to spend money at home, it's safer to deposit it in the credit cooperative." Now 57 percent of farmers around Caoting Township have joined the credit cooperative.
    Helping farmers solve difficulties and listening to their opinions to improve work are the main reasons for the development of the Caoting Township Credit Cooperative. The credit cooperative has simple deposit and loan procedures. Farmers can deposit money whenever they have it, and they can withdraw money whenever they need it, without time restrictions. Farmers can make small deposits and large withdrawals, or large deposits and small withdrawals. Some farmers deposit 30,000 or 20,000 yuan into the credit cooperative at regular intervals, planning to accumulate small amounts of money over the years to buy livestock or other useful things. Farmers call this method "accumulating small amounts of money to do big things."
    In order to manage the credit cooperative better, the farmers elected 62 members as representatives. After the wheat harvest last year, when the farmers sold their wheat and had surplus money, the representatives went to the members' homes to promote the benefits of savings. Many farmers gave the money to the representatives, who handled the deposit procedures for them. The woman, Guo, had a surplus of 2.8 million yuan and hid it in her pants pocket every day, fearing she would lose it. After the representatives learned about this situation, they went to her home and explained the benefits of the credit cooperative, which made her voluntarily deposit the money in the credit cooperative.
    Due to the active business of the credit cooperative, usury has disappeared around Caoting Township. Three years ago, usury was very rampant in Caoting Township, with interest rates as high as 1.5 dou of interest for every stone of grain borrowed per year. Now with the credit cooperative, farmers are no longer exploited by usury.

    河南武陟县草亭乡信用合作社帮助农民解决困难
    河南省武陟县草亭乡信用合作社由于帮助农民解决生产和生活上的困难，得到农民的爱戴，业务也获得发展。
    草亭乡信用合作社成立两年来，已吸收农民闲散资金六亿七千五百八十万元。并用这些款帮助当地农民买牲口一百零一头，小牲口换大牲口一百二十二头；买犁、耧、耙一百零八件，盖房八十间，新买和修理大车各八辆，并解决了不少农民在婚、丧、疾病和各种意外事件中所遇到的经济困难。
    草亭乡信用合作社还利用经济力量巩固和发展了农民的互助合作组织。乡里王世候互助组，因为没有牲口，解决不了人工换畜工的问题，组员们有的不想互助了，后来因为得到了信用合作社的帮助，买了一头牲口，有了公共的牲口，大家互助的劲头就足了。农民原如云和他的田地相连的一些农户因为得到信用合作社的帮助，打了一口井。大家合伙浇地后，慢慢就组织成为互助组。
    在信用合作社的长期影响下，这个乡的农民养成了储蓄的习惯。农民王万金已把存了二十多年的一批老柏树木材卖了二百万元存入信用合作社。他说要把“死钱变成活钱”。农民陈令富过去有钱就买粮食存着，前年霉烂了三百斤，去年收了小麦后，他卖了一千五百斤麦，并把钱存到信用合作社。农民马来必有余款四十五万元，在家放了十天就零花了五万元，他说：“家里放着钱随手花了，还是存到信用合作社保险些。”现在草亭乡周围已有百分之五十七的农民入了信用合作社。
    帮助农民解决困难并倾听他们的意见改进工作，是草亭乡信用合作社获得发展的主要原因。信用合作社办理存款和放款手续简便，农民啥时有钱啥时可以存，啥时用款啥时可以取，不受时间的限制。农民可以零存整付，也可以整存零付。有些农户把平常收入的三万两万陆续存入信用合作社去，打算着在长年累月零钱积多了好买个牲口或其他成用的东西，农民称这种办法为“积小钱办大事”。
    农民们为了把信用合作社管理得更好，选出六十二位社员当代表。去年麦收以后，农民卖了麦子有余钱，代表们就到社员家去宣传储蓄的好处。不少农民把钱交给代表，由代表代他们办理存款手续。妇女郭氏有二百八十万的余钱，每天藏在裤袋里，很怕丢掉了。代表了解这情况后，就到她家讲明信用合作社的好处。使她自愿把款存到信用合作社。
    由于信用合作社业务的活跃，草亭乡周围的高利贷已经绝迹。三年前草亭乡高利贷非常猖獗，利息高者达到一石粮食一年还一石五斗利息。现在有了信用合作社，农民不再受高利贷的剥削了。
