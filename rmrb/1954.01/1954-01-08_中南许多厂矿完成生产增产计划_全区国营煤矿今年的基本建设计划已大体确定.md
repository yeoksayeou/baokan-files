Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Many state-owned factories and mines under the coal, non-ferrous metals, power, and textile systems of the Central South region, as well as other state-owned factories and mines, have completed or overfulfilled their 1953 production plans and increased production and conservation plans ahead of schedule before the end of the year. Among them, the profits turned over by state-owned coal mines, the power system, and some non-ferrous metal mines have been turned over to the national treasury. Important factories and mines that completed the annual production plan or the plan for increasing production and practicing economy ahead of schedule include the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory, Hunan Xikuangshan Mining Bureau, Xiangxi Tungsten Mine, Guangxi Pinggui Mining Bureau, Guangzhou Xicun Cement Factory, Guangzhou Paper Mill, and Guangzhou Electric Power Bureau. The Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, having completed the annual repair plan for locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars seventeen days to one and a half months ahead of schedule, became the first factory in the country's railway locomotive and rolling stock repair factories to complete the annual state plan. Therefore, the factory received a circular of commendation from the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government. The state-owned Xiangxi Tungsten Mine completed the tungsten ore production plan forty days ahead of schedule, and the quality also exceeded the national standards, and was therefore commended by the Central South Branch of the Non-ferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government.

Last year, factories and mines in the Central South region paid attention to improving management, so the level of production management has been greatly improved. In particular, factories and mines that established planning management earlier completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule due to the increased accuracy of the operation plan.

In the fourth quarter of last year, factories and mines in the Central South region launched a labor emulation campaign centered on completing operation plans in the movement to increase production and practice economy. The number of employees participating in the competition in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in the region generally accounted for more than 50% of the total number, and units with better competition reached 80% or even 100%. This was the largest and longest-lasting labor emulation campaign in the region in recent years. The production enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees have been fully utilized in the movement. The employees of the Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory alone found 407 large and small tips, thus saving 5,400 man-hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th: The basic construction plan for state-owned coal mines in the Central South region in 1954 has been largely determined. According to the country's urgent need for industrial coal, especially coking coal, the Central South region will use great efforts to develop new coalfields in 1954. Drilling and some construction work will be carried out in new coalfields in Pingdingshan, Yuxian, Jiaozuo Macun in Henan, and Anhua in Hunan. Most of these areas are rich in coking coal, and after several years of construction, they can supply a large amount of the needs of the emerging iron and steel industry base in the Central South region. However, the construction scale of these areas is large and the time is long, and they cannot be put into production in one or two years. Therefore, in 1954, the Central South region will also vigorously restore, renovate, and expand existing mines so that more coal can be produced in a relatively short period of time. For example, after the restoration and renovation of two pairs of mine shafts in Jiaozuo and Pingxiang in 1954, it is expected that the region can produce 400,000 tons more coal each year. At present, the construction preparation work for the first quarter has been largely completed. For example, the preliminary design of the Jiaozuo No. 39 mine, which is required to be restored and completed in 1954, was delivered to the construction unit in December 1953, and the technical design will also be delivered in January. The preliminary design of the local renovation project of Jiaozuo Lifeng Mine can also be delivered in January. A large amount of steel bars, cement and other materials required for basic construction are being continuously transported to the mine. The winches, water pumps and other equipment to be installed in the first quarter have also been transported to the mine, waiting for construction.

    中南许多厂矿完成生产增产计划
    全区国营煤矿今年的基本建设计划已大体确定
    【新华社讯】中南区国营煤矿、有色金属、电业、纺织系统所属厂矿以及其他一些国营厂矿，已在年前纷纷提前完成和超额完成了一九五三年的生产计划和增产节约计划。其中国营煤矿、电业系统以及一部分有色金属矿山的上缴利润并已分别上缴国库。提前完成去年全年生产计划或增产节约计划的重要厂矿，有江岸机车车辆修理工厂、湘潭电机厂、湖南锡矿山矿务局、湘西钨矿、广西平桂矿务局、广州西村水泥厂、广州纸厂、广州电业局等。江岸机车车辆修理工厂，由于提前十七天到一个半月完成了去年机车、客车、货车的全年检修计划，成为全国铁路机车车辆修理工厂中第一个完成全年国家计划的工厂。因此，该厂受到了中央人民政府铁道部通报表扬。国营湘西钨矿提前四十天完成钨砂产量计划，质量也超过了国家规定的指标要求，因而也受到了中央人民政府重工业部有色金属工业管理局中南分局的通报表扬。
    中南区各厂矿在去年注意改进了经营管理，因此生产管理水平有了相当提高。特别是建立计划管理较早的厂矿，由于作业计划的精确性提高，提前完成了去年全年生产计划。
    去年第四季度，中南区各厂矿在增产节约运动中，曾开展了一个以完成作业计划为中心内容的劳动竞赛。全区国营工矿企业中参加竞赛的职工人数一般占全部人数百分之五十以上，竞赛开展得较好的单位，还达到了百分之八十以至百分之百。这是近几年来全区规模最大时间最持久的一次劳动竞赛运动。广大职工的生产积极性和创造性在运动中得到了充分发挥。仅湘潭电机厂一个厂的职工找出的大小窍门就有四百零七件，因而节省了五千四百个工时。
    【新华社武汉七日电】中南区国营煤矿一九五四年的基本建设计划已大体确定。根据国家对工业用煤特别是炼焦煤的迫切需要，中南区一九五四年将用很大力量开发新的煤田。河南的平顶山、禹县、焦作马村和湖南的安化等地，都将进行新煤田的钻探和部分建设工作。这些地区大部蕴藏有丰富的炼焦煤，经过若干年的建设后，它们就可以大量供应中南区新兴钢铁工业基地的需要。但是，这些地区矿井建设规模较大，时间较长，一两年内还不能投入生产，因此，一九五四年中南区还将同时大力恢复、改建和扩建现有的矿井，以便在较短时间内就能生产出更多的煤炭。如焦作、萍乡两地到一九五四年完成两对矿井的恢复和改建以后，预计全区每年就可以多生产四十万吨的煤。现在，第一季度施工准备工作已大体完成。如要求在一九五四年恢复完成的焦作三十九号矿井，初步设计已在一九五三年十二月份交到施工单位，技术设计也可在一月份交出。焦作李封矿的局部改建工程，也可在一月份交出初步设计。基本建设需用的大量钢筋、水泥等材料，正在源源地运到矿山。第一季度需要安装的绞车、水泵等也已运到矿山，等待施工。
