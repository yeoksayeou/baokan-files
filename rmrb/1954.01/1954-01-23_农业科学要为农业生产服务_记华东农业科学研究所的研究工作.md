Agricultural Science Should Serve Agricultural Production
    ——On the Research Work of the East China Agricultural Science Institute
    Fu Shengfa, Wang Zuhua
    Since its establishment in 1950, the East China Agricultural Science Institute has been conducting agricultural experiments and research to help farmers in East China solve many technical problems in production.

    Cultivating and promoting superior varieties is an extremely important task, and it has a direct impact on increasing crop yields. In terms of rice, the East China Agricultural Science Institute has cultivated and promoted three varieties: "Yixian Hong" (First Line Red), "Shengli Xian" (Victory Indica), and "Sihao" (Number Four). The advantages of the "Yixian Hong" variety are: it can avoid damage from rice borers and requires less fertilizer. Its yield is 5.3% to 14.3% higher than ordinary varieties; it is harvested three to five days earlier than "Shengli Xian", making it most suitable for double-cropping rice and wheat areas in Anhui and northern Jiangsu. The yield of "Shengli Xian" is 9.7% to 16.3% higher than ordinary varieties, making it most suitable for areas with insufficient water sources (it can be irrigated one less time). The advantages of the "Sihao" variety are: it is fertilizer-tolerant and does not easily lodge. Its yield is 10% to 20% higher than ordinary varieties, making it most suitable for fertile land. Because these three rice varieties have their unique advantages, they are particularly popular among the masses. According to preliminary estimates, the cultivated area planted with the above-mentioned new varieties in Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Nanjing, and other places has reached several million mu, and it is expanding year by year. Li Fuquan, leader of the Li Fuquan Mutual Aid Group in Shuangzha Township, District 11, Nanjing, said: "'Yixian Hong' rice is really good. It can be planted in fallow fields, wheat fields, and rapeseed fields. It doesn't need much fertilizer, doesn't deplete the soil, has big panicles with many grains, and has a heavy weight (i.e., high yield). The panicles of our 'Bashi Zi' (ordinary variety) are too small to look at. With 'Yixian Hong', it is not cost-effective to plant 'Bashi Zi' in wheat fields anymore." In terms of wheat, four varieties have been cultivated: "5201," "Yihao" (Number One), "Sanhao" (Number Three), and "Ershiba Hao" (Number Twenty-Eight). The general yield is more than 5% higher than ordinary varieties, and they all have their advantages. For example, the yield of "5201" is 6.5% to 8.8% higher than the local variety with the highest yield; it matures five days earlier than other varieties, is resistant to rust and has no black smut disease, and is less prone to lodging. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for early rice areas in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The other three varieties are most suitable for areas south of the Huai River and have been planted by the broad masses. It is estimated that the current planting area is at least several million mu. In terms of vegetables, two varieties have been selected and bred: large-leaf spinach and early red tomato. Large-leaf spinach is popular among the masses because it grows quickly, can be planted many times, has a high yield, and commands a high price. At present, many vegetable farmers in the suburbs of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou have switched to planting this variety. Yao Guoliang, a vegetable farmer in Shuangbaigang, Nanjing, said: "Large-leaf spinach emerges four days faster, grows more than ten days faster, can be planted twice a year, has a yield that is more than half, and uses less fertilizer." Early red tomato is a good early-maturing, high-yielding variety. It not only matures ten days to half a month earlier than ordinary varieties, but also yields 12,000 jin per mu. Liu Enxi from District 2, Nanjing, said: "Early red tomatoes are really good, they bear a lot of fruit and ripen quickly."

    In terms of crop pest and disease control, the East China Agricultural Science Institute has also been continuously conducting research. The pear star moth is extremely harmful in the pear-producing areas of Xiaoxian and Dangshan, and many pear farmers have painfully cut down pear trees. In order to help farmers solve this problem, the institute has been engaged in research since 1950, using 50% wettable DDT diluted with water 250 to 300 times for prevention and control when pear buds germinate, with good results. In 1951, the institute cooperated with the Wanbei Farm to carry out demonstrations, which were welcomed by the masses. By the end of 1953, more than 60,000 pear trees had been treated, achieving a great harvest that had not been seen in more than ten years. Cotton aphids are also very harmful in the cotton-growing areas of Shandong. They not only affect yield but also delay the maturity period, increasing late-season cotton. In 1951, the institute conducted experiments with the Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences to solve the hard water problem, and the use of cottonseed oil slurry and cottonseed oil soap to control aphids also had very good results. Crickets are one of the main pests of coarse grains in Wanbei. In 1951, the institute cooperated with Wanbei Farm to study the use of scorched yellow wheat bran "666" poisonous bait to control this insect, which was very effective (only two jin of dry bait per mu is enough, costing only about 1,000 yuan). Pea weevil is one of the most serious pests in Wanbei, affecting pea yield. After discovering this situation, the institute immediately conducted experiments, trying to use the method of scalding seeds with boiling water to eliminate this pest, with good results. In 1952 and 1953, the institute cooperated with the Anhui Agricultural Experiment Station to conduct demonstrations in the Chahua District of Fuyang and Chengxiang County of Su County, and promoted this advanced technology. Wheat blossom midge is a major pest of wheat in northern Jiangsu and Wanbei. In 1950, 20 million mu of land were affected. In order to eliminate this pest, the institute cooperated with the northern Jiangsu and Wanbei farms to research and cultivate the new variety "Nanda 2419," which can resist pests and achieve high yields. At present, many farmers in areas south of the Huai River and in northern Jiangsu have planted this new variety. Cotton bollworm is one of the three major insect pests in China's agricultural production. It not only causes cotton to shed flowers and bolls, but also causes stiff petals and rotten bolls, reducing cotton yield. Since 1950, the institute has strengthened its research on this issue. In the past four years, based on the spirit of "prevention is more important than cure," various prevention and control methods have been researched: using curtain frames to dry flowers during the flowering period, and using chickens to peck at bollworms; spraying 50% wettable DDT mixed with water ten times in warehouses storing seed cotton or using manual capture; burning off the withered bolls of cotton stalks before Qingming Festival; treating cotton seeds with warm water soaking or fumigation methods before sowing; and burning and removing flower residue and spraying DDT in ginneries at any time, which are effective prevention and control methods during the overwintering period. These methods have been promoted in major cotton-producing areas across the country since 1953, which has played a certain role in increasing cotton production. Sweet potato black spot disease is an important problem in sweet potato production in the north, hindering the increase in yield. After experimental research, the method of using pit bud cuttings was used to prevent the occurrence of this disease. In order to popularize agricultural scientific knowledge, the East China Agricultural Science Institute produces a large number of pest and disease specimens every year for exhibition in cultural centers in various counties.

    Pigs and chickens are raised by every household in rural China and are the main sideline occupations of farmers. However, swine fever and fowl plague occur every year in various places, resulting in huge losses. To this end, the East China Agricultural Science Institute has concentrated its efforts on research since 1950, using crystal violet pig cholera vaccine to prevent swine fever (it only costs 600 yuan RMB per pig); using fowl plague vaccine to control fowl plague (it only costs 2 yuan RMB per chicken). After the successful research and development of these two vaccines, the Nanjing Serum Factory mass-produced them and supplied them to East China, North China, Inner Mongolia, and Central South, which can prevent and control 2.63 million pigs and 60 million chickens. This avoids the mass death of pigs and chickens, allowing rural sideline occupations to develop normally.

    The improvement of agricultural implements has a major relationship with increasing grain yield per unit area. The East China Agricultural Science Institute conducted in-depth surveys and research in rice-growing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and improved the old plows based on their shortcomings, and designed a new type of paddy field plow. This plow can not only plow to seven inches, but also is extremely labor-saving and convenient to use. Each plow costs only 250,000 yuan (if mass-produced, the cost can be reduced). In the spring of 1953, 60 units were trial-produced and distributed to Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Sichuan for trial use, and they were welcomed by the peasant masses.

    In the past two or three years, farmers from various places have often written letters to the East China Agricultural Science Institute, requesting solutions to various technical problems in agricultural production. For example, wheat nematode disease occurred in Mayaoxiang, Xiaodian District, Suqian County, Huaiyin Special District, northern Jiangsu, and local farmers wrote to inquire about prevention and control methods. After receiving the letter, the institute quickly informed them of the prevention and control methods and agreed to order nematode separators on their behalf. In addition, the institute sends personnel to rural areas at any time to help farmers solve technical problems in production on the spot. Nearby farmers come directly to the institute to ask for solutions to various problems. According to statistics, 417 cases were handled in 1953 alone.

    农业科学要为农业生产服务
    ——记华东农业科学研究所的研究工作
    傅胜发  汪祖华
    华东农业科学研究所，从一九五○年成立以来，进行了农业试验研究工作，帮助华东区农民解决了不少生产上的技术问题。
    培育和推广优良品种，是一件极为重要的工作，它对提高作物的产量有着直接的意义。在水稻方面，华东农业科学研究所培育和推广了“一线红”、“胜利籼”和“四号”三个品种。“一线红”品种的优点是：既可以避免螟虫的为害，又可以少施肥料。它的产量，比普通品种多百分之五点三到十四点三；比“胜利籼”要早收三天到五天，最适宜于安徽和苏北的稻麦两熟地区。“胜利籼”的产量要比普通种多收百分之九点七到十六点三，最适宜于水源不足的地区（可以少灌一次水）。“四号”品种的优点是：既耐肥，又不易倒伏。它的产量比普通种多收百分之十到二十，最适宜于土地肥沃的地区。由于这三个稻种都有它的独特优点，所以特别受到群众的欢迎。据初步估计，现在安徽、苏北、南京等地种植上述新品种的耕地面积已有几百万亩，并且在逐年扩展中。南京十一区双闸乡李福全互助组组长李福全说：“‘一线红’稻种真是好，空田、小麦田、油菜田都能栽，不多吃肥不拔地，头子大粒数多，成份重受打头（即产量高）。我们种的‘八十子’（普通品种）的穗头，就小的不能看。有了‘一线红’，小麦田再种‘八十子’就不合算了”。在小麦方面培育了“五二○一”“一号”
  “三号”和“二十八号”四个品种。一般产量都比普通种高出百分之五以上，而且也都有它的优点。譬如，“五二○一”的产量比当地产量最多的品种还要高出百分之六点五到八点八；它比其他品种早熟五天，既能抗锈病又没有黑穗病，更不易倒伏。所以，它特别适合于长江下游的早稻地区。其他三个品种最适合于淮河以南地区，并已为广大群众所种植。据估计，目前种植面积至少在几百万亩以上。在蔬菜方面，选育了大叶菠菜和早红蕃茄两个品种。大叶菠菜由于它长得快，种植次数多，产量大，价格高，即受到群众的欢迎。目前南京、上海和杭州郊区许多菜农都改种了这一品种。南京双拜岗菜农姚国梁说：“大叶菠菜出苗快四天，长的也快十多天，一年可多种二次，产量多一半，肥料也用的少。”早红蕃茄是个早熟丰产的优良品种，它不但比普通种早熟十天到半月，而且每亩可得到一万二千斤的产量。南京二区刘恩喜说：“早红蕃茄真不坏，结的多红的快。”
    在作物病虫害防治方面，华东农业科学研究所也不断进行了研究。梨星毛虫在萧县砀山产梨区域的为害极为严重，许多梨农把梨树忍痛砍掉。为了帮助农民解决这一问题，研究所从一九五○年起即开始从事研究，用百分之五十的可湿性滴滴涕加水二百五十倍到三百倍，在梨芽萌动时进行防治，效果良好。一九五一年，研究所和皖北农场合作进行示范，受到群众的欢迎。至一九五三年底，已有六万多株梨树进行了防治，获得了十数年来未有的大丰收。棉蚜虫在山东棉区为害也很严重，它不但影响产量，并使成熟期延迟，增加了霜后花。一九五一年研究所即与山东农业科学研究所进行了试验，解决了硬水问题，用棉油泥和棉油皂治蚜，效果也极良好。蟋蟀是皖北杂粮的主要害虫之一。一九五一年研究所和皖北农场合作研究，用焦黄麦麸“六六六”毒饵防治此虫，非常有效（每亩用干饵二斤就够，成本不过一千元左右）。豌豆象是皖北最严重的一种害虫，它影响着豌豆的产量。研究所发现这种情况以后，即进行试验，试用开水烫种的方法，消灭这种害虫，效果良好。在一九五二年一九五三年两年内，研究所和安徽农业试验场合作，在阜阳插花区和宿县城厢进行示范，并推广了这一先进技术。小麦吸浆虫是苏北和皖北地区小麦的主要害虫，一九五○年有二千万亩土地受害。为了扑灭这种虫害，研究所和苏北和皖北农场合作，研究培育了“南大二四一九”新品种，它既能抗御虫害，又能取得高产量。目前，淮河以南和苏北地区已有许多农民栽种这一新品种。棉花红铃虫是我国农业生产上的三大虫害之一，它不但使棉花落花落铃，更造成僵瓣、烂铃现象，降低了棉产量。研究所从一九五○年起加强了对这一问题的研究。四年来根据“防重于治”的精神，研究出了种种防治办法：在晒花时期利用帘架晒花，用鸡啄食红铃虫；在存放籽棉的仓库中喷撒百分之五十的可湿性滴滴涕加水十倍的液体或用人工捕捉；棉秸的枯铃在清明前烧光；在播种前用温汤浸种或熏蒸方法处理棉种；轧花厂随时烧掉清除的花渣和喷撒滴滴涕等越冬期有效的防治方法。这些办法从一九五三年起已在全国各主要棉产区开始推行，对棉花增产起了一定的作用。甘薯黑斑病是北方甘薯生产中的一个重要问题，它阻碍着产量的提高。经试验研究后，利用坑芽扦插的办法，防止了此病的发生。为了普及农业科学知识，华东农业科学研究所每年制作大量病虫标本，供各县文化馆展览。
    猪和鸡在我国农村中是家家户户都养的，是农民的主要副业。但各地每年都发生猪瘟、鸡瘟，损失很大。为此，华东农业科学研究所从一九五○年起就集中力量进行研究，用猪瘟结晶紫预防猪瘟（一头猪只花人民币六百元）；用鸡瘟疫苗防治鸡瘟（一只鸡才花二元人民币）。这两种疫苗研究成功后，即由南京血清厂大量制造，供应华东、华北、内蒙和中南等处，计可防治猪二百六十三万头，鸡六千万只。这就避免了猪、鸡的大量死亡，使农村副业得以正常发展。
    农具的改进，对提高粮食单位面积的产量有着重大的关系。华东农业科学研究所在江苏、浙江和安徽等省的水稻地区进行了深入的调查研究，针对旧犁的缺点进行改进，设计了一种新式的水田犁。这种犁不但能耕到七寸，而且使用起来极为省力方便。每部成本不过二十五万元（如能大量制造，成本还可降低）。一九五三年春曾试制六十部，分送浙江、江苏、安徽、福建、湖南、江西、广东和四川八省试用，受到农民群众的欢迎。
    近两三年来，各地农民经常写信给华东农业科学研究所，要求解决农业生产上的种种技术问题。例如，苏北淮阴专区宿迁县晓店区马瑶乡曾发生小麦线虫病，当地农民就写信来，询问防治办法。研究所接到来信后，迅速地将防治方法告诉他们，并答允代为订制线虫分离器。此外，研究所方面随时派员深入农村，就地帮助农民解决生产上的技术问题。附近的农民则直接到这里要求解决各种问题，据统计，仅一九五三年内就处理了四百一十七件。
