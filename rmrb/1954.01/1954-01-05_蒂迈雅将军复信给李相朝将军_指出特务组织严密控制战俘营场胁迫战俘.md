(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd) On December 31, 1953, General Li Xiangchao, Chief Representative of the Korean-Chinese side, sent a letter to General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, regarding the U.S. side's attempt to legalize the crime of forcibly detaining prisoners of war by the U.S. side through so-called "screening," expressing resolute opposition to "screening" or disguised "screening" of prisoners of war. The content of the letter can be found in the December 31st communique of the Korean-Chinese delegation to the Military Armistice Commission.

General Thimayya replied to the aforementioned letter from General Li Xiangchao on January 2, 1954. The full text of the reply is as follows: To Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers:

I have the honor to receive your letter of December 31, 1953.

On December 31, 1953, the Commander of the Indian Custodial Forces informed me that during the process of checking the list of prisoners of war in Compound B, one hundred and thirty-five Chinese prisoners of war took the opportunity to express their desire for repatriation. This may be due to the presence of a larger than usual number of custodial troops, which made them feel secure. You will recall that during the investigation into the alleged Zhang Zilong murder case on November 2, several prisoners of war requested repatriation. In fact, on the very first day of taking custody of the prisoners of war, nine Korean prisoners of war sought repatriation. Therefore, it is incomprehensible how the repatriation of one hundred and thirty-five prisoners of war can be considered "screening," in any sense of the term.

From the testimonies of some recently repatriated prisoners of war, it is learned that the camp leaders apparently told the prisoners of war that after December 23, no one could seek repatriation. The Commander of the Indian Custodial Forces felt it necessary to dispel this erroneous impression, so he arranged a broadcast to the prisoners of war, saying that those who wished to be repatriated still had the right to do so. This may have encouraged several prisoners of war to seek repatriation on December 31.

I wish to state clearly and emphatically that, based on my direct experience over the past four months, it seems to me that the fact that hundreds of prisoners of war are seeking repatriation in this particular way does not in any way alter the facts stated in the Commission's report. These facts remain as they are, the prisoner-of-war organizations still exist, and their coercive nature and harmful effects also remain.

I believe that in view of what I have said above, you will understand that in the minds of the custodial forces, nothing is more unimaginable than to arbitrarily replace the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" with the alleged "screening" procedure.

Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission Chairman, Lieutenant General Thimayya
January 2, 1954

### 蒂迈雅将军复信给李相朝将军  指出特务组织严密控制战俘营场胁迫战俘

    蒂迈雅将军复信给李相朝将军
    指出特务组织严密控制战俘营场胁迫战俘
    【新华社开城三日电】一九五三年十二月三十一日，朝中方面首席代表李相朝将军曾就美方企图利用所谓“甄别”来使美方强迫扣留战俘的罪行合法化问题，致函中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军，表示坚决反对对战俘进行“甄别”或变相的“甄别”。该信内容见军事停战委员会朝中代表团十二月三十一日的公报。
    蒂迈雅将军于一九五四年一月二日对上述李相朝将军的信提出答复。复信全文如下：朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表李相朝中将：
    我荣幸地收到一九五三年十二月三十一日你的来信。
    一九五三年十二月三十一日，印度看管部队司令官通知我在查对乙号围场战俘的名单的过程中，一百三十五名中国籍战俘趁机会表示了他们要求遣返的愿望。这可能是由于有多于通常数目的看管部队在场，使他们觉得安全有了保证。你会记得在十一月二日对据称张子龙凶杀案的情况进行调查的过程中，若干名战俘曾要求遣返。其实在接管战俘的第一天，就有九名朝鲜籍战俘寻求遣返。因此，不能了解何以一百三十五名战俘的遣返能被认为是“甄别”，无论从这个名词的任何意义上来讲。
    从一些新近遣返的战俘的证词中，得知营场首领显然曾对战俘说，十二月二十三日以后任何人都不能寻求遣返。印度看管部队司令官觉得必须清除这一谬误的印象，因此他安排了一次对战俘的广播，说那些愿意遣返的人仍然有权这样作，这件事可能鼓励了若干战俘在十二月三十一日寻求遣返。
    我愿明确而着重地说明，根据过去四个月的直接的经验，在我看来，数百余名战俘以这种特殊的方式寻求遣返一事，无论如何都不改变本委员会报告中所叙述的事实。这些事实依然如故，战俘组织依然存在，其胁迫的性质与有害的影响也依然存在。
    我相信鉴于我以上所说的话，你会了解在看管部队的思想上，再也没有比以据称的“甄别”手续来武断地代替“职权范围”的规定更不可想像的了。
        中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将
                          一九五四年一月二日
