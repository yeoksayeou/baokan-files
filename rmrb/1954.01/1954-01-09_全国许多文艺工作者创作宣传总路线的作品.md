    To provide vivid and powerful propaganda materials for the promotion of the general line, many professional and amateur literary and art workers across the country are launching various creative activities with great enthusiasm.
    Literary and art workers in various fields in the capital have respectively launched creative and preparatory activities related to the promotion of the general line. In December of last year, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized twenty dramatic, film, musical, and artistic workers from the capital, including Qu Xixian, An E, Zhang Wengang, Li Lili, Sun Jiaxiu, Xin Mang, and Ren Feng, to go to the suburbs of Beijing to participate in rural work in preparation for creation. The Central Academy of Fine Arts established a General Line Office to organize the academy's art workers to experience life and create works. More than forty people are participating, including Li Hua, Wang Qi, Dong Xiwen, Li Keran, Jiang Zhaohe, Ai Zhongxin, Wang Shikuo, Li Zongjin, Zong Qixiang, Deng Shu, and Liang Yulong. They will create various works such as comic strips, wall charts, peep shows, sketches, and puppet show scripts. The People's Fine Arts Publishing House's creative studio is creating New Year pictures, posters, and comic strips on the themes of encouraging farmers to sell surplus grain, participate in mutual aid and cooperation, and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. Literary and art workers in North China and Beijing are also actively creating short stories, one-act plays, operettas, songs, and folk arts suitable for rural propaganda, and many works have been completed and will soon be published by publishing agencies.
    Literary and art workers in Shenyang, Northeast China, have already completed works promoting the general line, including the local opera "Selling Grain and Buying Horses for Great Production," the drum ballad "Raising Pigs," and two sets of comic strips, "Selling Grain to the State" and "People Strive for Higher Ground," totaling more than 150 pictures, and twenty kinds of lantern slides such as "Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative" and "China's Industry in Progress." Many literary and art workers in Songjiang Province have gone deep into factories and rural areas to prepare scripts promoting the general line. Literary and art workers in Jilin Province have formed four groups for performance materials, art creation, broadcast materials, and music work, to create various forms of works promoting the general line. By December, professional and amateur literary and art workers in Heilongjiang Province had completed scripts and performance materials such as "For a Good Life" and "Turning Dead Grain into Cash," songs such as "Following the General Line Forward," and lantern slides such as "Old Man Li Actively Sells Surplus Grain." Cultural departments and literary and art organizations in Shenyang City and Jilin Province are also widely organizing and guiding amateur literary and art workers and folk artists to carry out creations related to the promotion of the general line.
    The East China Writers Association organized its member writers in Shanghai in December to study the general line and formulate creation plans. During the study, some writers have been experiencing life in factories and rural areas. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau held the third Shanghai Municipal Opera Circle Creation and Performance Work Conference in December, specifically discussing how to create and perform more and better new operas serving the national general line. Literary and art workers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Nanjing, Fuzhou, and other provinces and cities have gone deep into factories and rural areas to create short plays, poems, clappers, comic dialogues, Yue operas, storytelling, Pinghua, mountain songs, ditties, comic strips, and other short and pithy works promoting the general line. The short plays "Peddler Going to the Countryside" and "Double Selling Grain," created and performed by rural amateur theater troupe members studying at the Zhejiang Mass Art School, vividly demonstrated the patriotism of farmers selling surplus grain to the state.
    Literary and art workers in Guangdong have completed a batch of propaganda paintings, short plays, and poems. The short story "Cannot Take That Road" by Li Zhun, published in Henan Daily on November 20th last year, expressed the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road in rural areas, earnestly telling farmers that they must never take the capitalist dead end. After the novel was published, it had a great impact in the rural areas of Henan Province. Rural theater troupes and primary and secondary schools in more than fifty places have adapted the novel into scripts for performance. The Henan Provincial People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau and the Henan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Workers have adapted the novel into dramas, Bangzi operas, Qu operas, Zhuizi operas, and serial wall charts, which have been widely printed and distributed to various places as propaganda materials.
    Music workers in Southwest China and Sichuan Province were divided into ten creation groups. A creation group composed of teachers and students from the Southwest Conservatory of Music is preparing to complete forty songs before the Spring Festival. The Sichuan Provincial People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau decided to concentrate on publicizing the musical creations of the general line during the Spring Festival and hold a concert. The Southwest Academy of Fine Arts also formed three groups to carry out art creations promoting the general line. Many cultural centers in Sichuan Province are organizing folk artists to create storytelling lyrics promoting the general line. Literary and art groups in Northwest China and Shaanxi once organized literary and art workers to go to the countryside to participate in grain purchase and mutual aid cooperation, preparing for creation. Many of the art works promoting the general line created by Northwest art workers have been published. The Northwest Opera Research Institute also organized propaganda teams to go to the countryside to collect new people and new things from farmers selling surplus grain, write small scripts and storytelling clapper materials, and perform and publicize them in various places in a timely manner.

    全国许多文艺工作者创作宣传总路线的作品
    为了给总路线宣传提供生动有力的宣传材料，全国各地许多专业和业余的文艺工作者正以极大的热情展开各种创作活动。
    首都各方面的文艺工作者已分别展开关于宣传总路线的创作和准备创作的活动。中国文学艺术界联合会已在去年十二月组织了首都的戏剧、电影、音乐、美术工作者瞿希贤、安娥、张文纲、黎莉莉、孙家琇、辛莽、刃锋等二十人赴北京郊区参加农村工作，准备创作。中央美术学院成立了总路线办公室，负责组织该院美术工作者体验生活，进行创作，参加工作的有李桦、王琦、董希文、李可染、蒋兆和、艾中信、王式廓、李宗津、宗其香、邓澍、梁玉龙等四十多人，他们将分别创作连环画、挂图、洋片、速写、傀儡戏剧本等各种作品。人民美术出版社创作室正在创作以鼓励农民出售余粮、参加互助合作和加强工农联盟为主题的年画、招贴画和连环画。华北和北京市的文艺工作者们也纷纷创作适合于农村宣传的短篇小说、独幕话剧、小歌剧、歌曲、曲艺等作品，并有许多作品已经完成，即将由出版机关出版。
    东北区沈阳市文艺工作者已经完成的宣传总路线的作品有地方戏“卖粮买马大生产”，鼓词“养猪”，连环画“把粮食卖给国家”、“人往高处走”等两套共一百五十多幅，幻灯片“高坎村农业生产合作社”、“在前进中的中国工业”等二十种。松江省的文艺工作者已有多人分别深入工厂、农村，准备创作宣传总路线的剧本。吉林省的文艺工作者已经分别组成演唱材料、美术创作、广播材料、音乐工作等四个组，分头创作宣传总路线的各种形式的作品。黑龙江省的专业和业余文艺工作者到十二月已完成了“为了好生活”、“死粮变活钱”等剧本和演唱材料，“顺着总路线向前走”等歌曲，“积极卖余粮的李老大爷”等幻灯片。沈阳市、吉林省的文化主管部门和文艺团体也都在广泛组织和辅导业余文艺工作者和民间艺人进行有关宣传总路线的创作。
