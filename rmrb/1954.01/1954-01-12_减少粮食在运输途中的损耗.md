    Reduce Grain Loss During Transportation

    Liang Zhengda of the Grain Bureau of Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province, writes: I am a transfer and dispatch worker at the Grain Bureau of Xinchang County. I saw a lot of grain being transferred at Xiaoshan Railway Station in Zhejiang, but due to careless packaging, it was scattered all over the ground after being moved and shaken; I also saw grain scattered all over the ground at Xinyi Railway Station in Jiangsu. It is understood that the situation of large amounts of grain being lost during transportation is not an isolated case at present.

    The reasons for this situation are: on the one hand, some comrades in the grain department lack a high degree of spirit to cherish state property and are careless in packaging grain; on the other hand, some comrades in the transportation department lack the necessary sense of responsibility for the protection of grain. They believe that grain loss is a matter for the grain department and has nothing to do with the transportation unit. Some even know that the sacks containing the grain are broken and the grain is about to leak, but they still let the porters load it onto the train.

    Therefore, I suggest that the grain department must conscientiously do a good job in bagging when transferring grain out, and broken bags must not be transported out; the transportation department should also attach importance to reducing grain loss, and strengthen the education of porters to cherish grain. As long as both parties attach importance to this issue and cooperate closely, we can reduce the loss of grain during transportation.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    减少粮食在运输途中的损耗
    浙江新昌县粮食局梁正达来信：我是新昌县粮食局调运员。我在浙江萧山火车站看见很多转运的粮食由于包装马虎，经过搬运震动撒得遍地；在江苏新沂火车站我也曾看到满地都撒着粮食。据了解，在调运途中大量损耗粮食的情况，目前还不是个别的。
    发生这样情况的原因：一方面，是粮食部门某些同志缺乏高度爱护国家财产的精神，在包装粮食时工作马虎；另一方面，运输部门有些同志对粮食的保护缺少应有的责任心，他们认为粮食受损失是粮食部门的事，与运输单位无关，有的甚至明知道装粮食的麻袋破了，粮食要漏掉，却仍让搬运工人装上车去。
    因此，我建议粮食部门在外调粮食时必须认真做好灌包工作，破包千万不要外运；运输部门也应该重视减少粮食损耗，并对搬运工人加强爱护粮食的教育。只要双方重视这个问题，并密切合作，我们就可以减少粮食在运输途中的损失。
