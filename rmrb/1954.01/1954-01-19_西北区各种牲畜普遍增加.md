The number of livestock of all kinds in the agricultural and pastoral areas of Northwest China, including cattle, horses, donkeys, camels, and sheep and goats, generally increased in 1953. According to preliminary investigations, the net increase averaged 13.7 percent compared to 1952, exceeding the 1953 propagation plan. Among them, the net increase rate of sheep and goats was 17.2 percent, and the net increase rate of large livestock was 8.8 percent.

The universal increase of large and small livestock in Northwest China in 1953 was due to the fact that the Party committees and People's Governments at all levels further implemented the policies of national equality, unity, and protection and development of animal husbandry, and specifically led the masses to overcome natural disasters. Since Xinjiang improved and strengthened its leadership over pastoral work in 1952, it has greatly enhanced the confidence of herdowners in the management of animal husbandry and the production enthusiasm of herdsmen. In most areas, herdsmen actively cut grass and built corrals, and promptly moved to winter and spring grazing areas, safely passing the grass shortage season of the winter of 1952 and the spring of 1953. The relevant departments in Shaanxi Province discovered the phenomenon of a large number of barren adult female animals in the past, and immediately instructed the special districts and counties to convene meetings to carry out animal husbandry and veterinary work, summarized the previous animal husbandry and veterinary work, and rewarded those who had made achievements in developing and protecting livestock, improving their enthusiasm and strengthening breeding work. In Ningxia Province, without affecting the growth of trees, with the consent of the local ethnic groups, many pastures were delineated in Helan Mountain, Niutou Mountain, Da Luo Mountain, Xiao Luo Mountain, and Southwest Hua Mountain, together with the wasteland on both sides of the Yellow River, to organize surrounding herdsmen and farmers to move and graze livestock, solving the grass shortage difficulties of approximately 400,000 livestock in the province. Qinghai Province also mobilized the masses to dig 245 wells, build 393 water cellars, and construct 68 dams, so that grasslands that had grass but no water in the past could be utilized in 1953. At the same time, in order to solve the difficulties of poor farmers and herdsmen in developing livestock and the living difficulties of some poor herdsmen, the provinces throughout the region successively issued more than 30 billion yuan in loans. In many places in pastoral areas, adjustments and reductions were made to pastoral taxes based on local conditions. This further enhanced the production enthusiasm of the vast number of herdsmen.

Party and government organizations and cadres at all levels actively mobilized and organized farmers and herdsmen to overcome difficulties and protect livestock, further encouraging the enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen to increase and protect livestock, making the livestock in various places healthier and stronger, and improving the breeding rate and survival rate of livestock. For example, in many places such as Tuoli County and Qitai County in Xinjiang, the lambing rate reached more than 60 percent, and the survival rate of young livestock in Tacheng and Ili Special Zones generally reached more than 90 percent. In carrying out the above-mentioned work of increasing and protecting livestock, many temporary and seasonal cooperative and mutual aid organizations have emerged in many places. For example, herdsmen in the Yanchi area of Ningxia graze livestock in "groups," and cooperate in shearing wool, saving labor to dig licorice, increasing income; Sujitan in Yuanyuan County, Qinghai Province, implemented unified pen moving, rationally utilizing grasslands, and strengthening livestock physique; many places in Xinjiang organized herdsmen to assist in lambing and protect lambs, which also reduced the mortality of young livestock; enabling many herdsmen to experience the practical benefits brought to them by "organized" mutual assistance and cooperation in production, and recognizing the superiority of mutual assistance and cooperation in promoting the increase of animal husbandry production.

    西北区各种牲畜普遍增加
    西北农、牧业区的牛、马、驴、骆驼和绵羊、山羊等大小牲畜，一九五三年普遍增加。据初步调查：平均计算较一九五二年净增加了百分之十三点七，超额完成了一九五三年的增殖计划。其中绵羊、山羊净增率为百分之十七点二，大牲畜净增率为百分之八点八。
    西北各地一九五三年大、小牲畜的普遍增殖，是由于中共各级党委和人民政府进一步贯彻了民族平等团结和保护、发展畜牧业的政策，具体领导群众战胜了自然灾害获得的。新疆自一九五二年改进和加强了对牧区工作的领导后，大大提高了牧主对畜牧业的经营信心和牧民的生产积极性。大部地区的牧民积极打草搭圈，及时转入冬、春窝子，安全渡过一九五二年冬和一九五三年春的缺草季节。陕西省有关部门发现各地成年母畜以往大量空怀的现象，即指示各专区和县，召开开展畜牧兽医工作的会议，总结了以往的畜牧、兽医工作，并对发展和保护牲畜有成绩的人作了奖励，提高了他们的积极性，加强了配种工作。宁夏省在不影响林木生长的情况下，取得当地各族群众的同意，在贺兰山、牛头山、大小罗山、西南华山等地划出许多草场，连同黄河两岸荒滩，组织周围牧民农民移往放牧牲畜，解决了全省约四十万只牲畜的缺草困难。青海省并发动群众打井二百四十五眼，修水窖三百九十三个，筑涝坝六十八个，使过去有草没水的草地在一九五三年就得以利用。同时，为解决穷苦农牧民发展牲畜的困难和一些穷苦牧民的生活困难，全区各省还先后发放了三百多亿元贷款。牧区许多地方在牧税方面，依据当地具体情况，做了调整和减少。这就更加提高了广大牧民的生产积极性。
    党和人民政府的各级组织与干部积极发动组织农、牧民克服困难保护牲畜，更鼓舞了农、牧民增畜保畜的积极性，使各地牲畜的体质恢复健壮，提高了牲畜的繁殖率和成活率。如新疆托里县、奇台县等许多地方的羊只繁殖率达到百分之六十以上，塔城、伊犁专区的幼畜成活率一般达到百分之九十以上。在进行上述增畜保畜工作中，许多地方更出现了临时性的、季节性的合作、互助组织。如宁夏盐池一带牧民“朋群”放牧，合作剪毛，节省出劳力挖甘草，增加了收入；青海省亹源县苏吉滩实行团结搬圈，合理地利用草原，增强了牲畜体质；新疆许多地方组织牧民接羔护羔，也减少了幼畜死亡；使许多牧民体验到“组织起来”互助合作生产给他们带来的实际利益，认识到互助合作对促进畜牧业增产的优越性。
