Mobilizing Women to Participate in Agricultural Production Cooperatives
Northwest China Women's Work Committee
Minister of Production Department Gao Minzhen

    According to the requirements and steps of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for further developing agricultural production cooperatives, the Northwest region is currently actively preparing for the establishment of cooperatives. This is not only a major task for Party and government leading organs and general rural work departments, but also a major task for women's federations at all levels. That is to say, women's federations at all levels must conscientiously mobilize women to participate in agricultural production cooperatives.
    Currently, there are more than 300 agricultural production cooperatives in the Northwest region. Because Party and government leading organs at all levels have attached importance to women's work and set examples in the work of establishing and consolidating cooperatives, more and more women are joining the cooperatives. According to statistics from Suide Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, last spring alone, 1,376 women had joined the cooperatives. According to the situation in the four cooperatives that we重点检查 in Shaanxi and Ningxia provinces and the reports from various places, women's political awareness, cultural level, and production technology have improved to varying degrees after joining the cooperatives, and their social status has gradually improved as a result.
    First, after women participate in agricultural production cooperatives, the opportunities for collective labor increase, and the number of people participating in labor increases, so they play a greater role in production. The Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, has a total of 35 female members, who are organized into three production groups and adopt the method of "fixed quality, fixed quantity, and fixed time" piece-rate payment. Last year, the entire cooperative's 150 mu of cotton, 64 mu of corn, 73 mu of beans, 15 mu of millet, and 12 mu of watermelon, totaling 314 mu, were almost entirely worked on by women, except for the sowing and two hoeings of the cotton by men (with the participation of individual old men and children). In the autumn, men and women together worked 2,441 labor days, of which women accounted for 854, or 35 percent. The women worked for a maximum of six months, totaling 13 people; some worked for three months, totaling 11 people; and the fewest worked for one month, totaling 11 people (due to illness or childcare). The Huang Zhen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ningxia Province has a total of 14 female members, of whom 8 worked in the fields for the whole year or half a year, 4 worked in the fields for four months, and only 2 worked in the fields for a short time.
    Second, after joining the cooperatives, women gradually improved their political awareness and collectivist thinking, and displayed enthusiasm for labor. In the early stage of establishing the cooperatives, women and men together generally received a more systematic education on the socialist future. Later, they regularly participated in democratic life and collective labor, and gradually developed collectivist thinking. In the Ma Tinghai Cooperative in Dali County, during the summer harvest last year, it was going to be windy one night, and the cooperative called on all members to go to the fields to rush to harvest the wheat. Led by female deputy director Hou Yuqin, young and middle-aged women and male members went to the fields together and harvested 40 mu of wheat that night. During the autumn harvest, when the male labor force couldn't manage, the women picked cotton during the day and moved corn and harvested green beans by moonlight in the evening, completing the harvesting task on time.
    Third, within the cooperatives, men and women are appropriately divided, achieving a more reasonable use of female labor. For example, in the Pu Zhongzhi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangmang Village, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, during last year's summer harvest, men released water and transplanted rice seedlings, while women harvested broad beans and wheat, and were responsible for threshing. Another example is the Huang Zhen Cooperative, where during the autumn harvest, women were responsible for cutting millet, selecting seeds, and twisting ropes for bundling crops, so that men could concentrate on cutting rice and complete the autumn harvest task in a timely manner.
    Fourth, the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women has stimulated women's enthusiasm for labor production. For example, after last year's summer harvest, the Huang Zhen Cooperative implemented a method of pre-borrowing grain based on labor (borrowing five jin of grain per labor day), with more borrowing for more labor days and less borrowing for fewer labor days, which greatly stimulated women's enthusiasm for labor. Everyone competed to work, and no one was willing to fall behind. Another example is a female member of the Ma Tinghai Cooperative who did not work well in the mutual aid group in the past, but after joining the cooperative, she went to work in the fields very early every day. When others asked her "Why do you go to work so early?", she said, "The cooperative distributes dividends according to labor!" Because of her active work and many labor days, the economic status of the women also improved. At the same time, women also actively learned to use new farm tools, improve cultivation techniques, and participate in pest control activities. For example, the female members of the Ma Tinghai Cooperative actively caught insects and used sprayers to control cotton aphids. When the cooperative conducted a high-yield experiment on six mu of dryland cotton fields, the women also learned the new method of打卡棉花. Collective labor has created common leisure time, so the opportunities for collective learning have increased. Women can study culture more actively. Twenty-one female members of the Ma Tinghai Cooperative attend民校 and persist in studying for two hours every day (stopped during busy farming seasons). Among them, 18 people have already learned 100 to 300 characters, and the most have learned 400 characters. They have also gained a lot of new knowledge, and their cultural level has improved.
    Fifth, after women join the cooperatives, due to active labor and labor achievements, the discrimination against women in society and the phenomenon of women being abused in families has been transformed, and family relations have been improved. For example, the Wang Shunqing couple in the Zhong Jixiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huzhu County, Qinghai Province, used to fight and not talk to each other, which affected production. After they joined the cooperative, the woman worked especially well and achieved great results. When the cooperative distributed dividends last year, it was calculated that Shunqing had 86 labor days, while his wife had 112 labor days, and the two shared 1,732 jin of staple food. Since then, the couple has reconciled. Another example is Hou Yumei, a female member of the cooperative, who used to have a bad relationship with her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law did not treat her daughter-in-law as a human being, and the daughter-in-law was unwilling to work hard, and the family was in a state of deprivation. After Hou Yumei joined the cooperative, she worked hard under everyone's education, learned the药剂拌种and温汤浸种 methods, and also learned to扬场. She received more grain during the dividend distribution, and her relationship with her mother-in-law improved. These facts have made all members of the cooperative and nearby people further realize the benefits of being organized.
    However, the development of women's work in cooperatives is still uneven in various places. Some cooperatives have not done enough political and ideological education for female members; many cooperatives do not attach importance to cultivating female backbones; some cooperatives rate female members' work points too low, not in accordance with the principle of equal pay for equal work; some male members are afraid that women will earn too many work points and do not assign work to women; and some cooperatives combine women's labor work points with family work points, so that women do not understand how many work points they have earned. These problems should be resolved reasonably as soon as possible. Based on the above situation, we believe that we can make efforts in the following five aspects.
    First, before establishing a cooperative, it is necessary to educate women on the general line and lay a good ideological foundation. Before the Feng Baolin Mutual Aid Group in Xianyang County was transformed into a cooperative, insufficient attention was paid to the education of female group members. It was believed that the education of male group members would be enough to transform the group into a cooperative. However, when registering to join the cooperative, 5 of the 11 households were headed by women. Women had concerns in their minds and did not agree to join the cooperative. Women in other households also had opinions on joining the cooperative, which increased resistance. Later, the women were educated and their ideological problems were resolved, and they became an important force in the establishment of the cooperative. When the Ma Tinghai Cooperative started to be established, it mobilized men and women to participate in the establishment study together, discussed various documents related to the establishment of the cooperative, and used family meetings to mobilize, so there were no major obstacles. Therefore, when establishing a cooperative, it is necessary to conduct good mobilization for women so that they understand the benefits of the cooperative for women. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the education of equality between men and women and oppose the feudal remnants of thought that favor men over women. In addition, we should also often educate female members with the new moral qualities of advanced figures and heroic models, overcome the narrow, selfish, and other backward thinking among female members, and gradually establish collectivist thinking.
    Second, cultivate female backbones within the cooperative and strengthen the core leadership force. Although some cooperatives have women as directors, deputy directors, committee members, and group leaders, some of them are not capable, lack leadership experience, let alone political and ideological leadership. Therefore, the leadership of the cooperative should specifically help them deal with some of the more complex problems among female members, let them handle some of the simpler problems independently first, and gradually improve their ability to handle affairs. In addition, with the consent of their families, a group of female backbones can be selected to study in the mutual aid and cooperation training classes run by the county and district people's governments to improve their policy level and leadership ability so that they can gradually understand the business and truly assume the responsibilities they should bear.
    Third, it is necessary to implement equal pay for equal work for men and women, and female members' work points should be calculated separately. Women's labor achievements should be summarized quarterly, and those who do well should be commended to encourage them to continue their efforts. To thoroughly realize the principle of equal pay for equal work, on the one hand, women must strive for it themselves, and on the other hand, it is necessary to overcome the feudal thinking and discrimination against women among some male members and leading cadres.
      Fourth, according to the specialties and specific conditions of female members, implement the division of labor between men and women and reasonably use female labor. Adopt methods such as small contract work or piece-rate work to contract certain farm work to women. Reasonably evaluate work and record points based on the type of farm work, the quality, the length of time, and the amount of work done. During busy farming seasons, baby-holding groups can be organized to reduce the burden of children on women. However, the nanny's salary should be negotiated by the mother and the nanny and paid by the mother, not borne by the cooperative. In the harvest season, in order to prevent grain from being lost and to achieve fast harvesting and threshing, mutual aid in cooking can be promoted so that women can free up time for cooking and participate in field production.
    Fifth, help female members actively learn advanced farming techniques. Through collective labor, women recognize that being organized is a good opportunity to learn technology. Only by improving technology can they keep up with the current needs of production. In addition, a certain number of female activists in the cooperative should be selected to study in the technical training classes run by the people's government so that they can learn one or two advanced technologies that can be promoted locally in order to lead other female members in carrying out a mutual teaching and learning movement within the cooperative. Only by enabling women to master technology like men can they fully play their role in agricultural production.

    发动妇女参加农业生产合作社
    西北区妇女工作委员会
    生产部部长         高敏珍
    根据中共中央西北局进一步发展农业生产合作社的要求和步骤，目前西北各地正在积极准备建社。这不只是党政领导机关和一般农村工作部门的重大任务，也是各级妇联组织的重大任务。就是说，各级妇联必须认真发动妇女参加农业生产合作社。
    目前西北地区已经有农业生产合作社三百多个。由于各地党、政领导机关在建社和整顿合作社的工作中重视了妇女工作，树立了榜样，所以妇女入社的愈来愈多。去春仅陕西绥德专区统计，入社的妇女已经有一千三百七十六人。根据我们到陕西、宁夏两省重点检查的四个合作社和各地报告中的情况看来，妇女入社以后，在政治觉悟、文化水平、生产技术上都有了不同程度的提高，因而社会地位也逐渐提高了。
    第一、妇女参加农业生产合作社以后，集体劳动的机会增加了，参加劳动的人数增多了，所以在生产上发挥了比较大的作用。陕西大荔县马廷海农业生产合作社，共有三十五个女社员，编成三个生产小组，采用“定质、定量、定时”的按件计工办法。去年全社一百五十亩棉花、六十四亩玉米、七十三亩豆子、十五亩谷子和十二亩打瓜，共计三百十四亩，除男的下种，锄了二遍棉花以外，其他如定苗、间苗、打卡棉花、锄玉米、拾棉花等工作，几乎全部是妇女作的（其中有个别老汉、小孩参加）。秋季男女共作二千四百四十一个劳动日，其中妇女占到八百五十四个，占百分之三十五。妇女劳动时间最多的为六个月，计十三人；有的三个月，计十一人；最少的是一个月，计十一人（因病或孩子拖累）。宁夏省黄珍农业生产合作社共有十四个女社员，其中全年或半年下地的八人，下地四个月的四人，下地时间短的只有二人。
    第二、妇女入社以后，逐步提高了政治觉悟和集体主义思想，发挥了劳动积极性。在建社初期，妇女和男子一起曾经普遍受到了一次较系统的社会主义前途教育。以后她们经常参加民主生活和集体劳动，逐渐生长了集体主义思想。大荔县马廷海合作社，去年夏收中的一天晚上，将要刮大风，社里号召全体社员下地抢收麦子。在女副社长侯玉琴带领下，青、壮年妇女和男社员一起下地，当夜就抢收了四十亩麦子。秋收时，男劳力顾不来，妇女就白天拾花，晚上借着月光搬玉米、收绿豆，按时完成了收割任务。
    第三、合作社内，男女适当分工，做到比较合理的使用女劳力。如陕西长安县王蟒村蒲忠智农业生产合作社，去年夏收时，男子放水、插秧，妇女们则收割扁豆麦，并担任了碾场工作。又如黄珍合作社，秋收时妇女担任割糜子、谷子、选种、搓捆庄稼用的绳子等活，使男人们能集中力量去割稻子，及时完成收秋任务。
    第四、男女劳动同工同酬的原则，激发了妇女劳动生产的积极性。如黄珍合作社，在去年夏收以后，实行按劳力预借粮食（一个劳动日借五斤粮）的办法，劳动日多的多借，少的少借，因此大大地激发了妇女的劳动热情，大家争着干活，谁也不甘心落后。又如马廷海合作社，一个女社员过去在互助组时劳动不好，转社后每天很早下地干活，别人问她“为啥这么早下地”，她说：“合作社是按劳分红哩！”由于积极干活，劳动日多，所以妇女们的经济地位也提高了。同时，妇女也积极学习使用新农具，改良耕作技术，参加防治病虫害等活动。如马廷海合作社的女社员，曾经积极捉虫，使用喷雾器防治棉蚜。当该社在六亩旱地棉田中进行丰产试验时，妇女们也学习了新法打卡棉花。集体的劳动，产生了共同的余暇，因此集体学习的机会增加了，妇女们能更加积极地学习文化，马廷海合作社有二十一个女社员上民校，每天坚持两小时的学习
  （农忙时停止）。其中十八人已经认识一百至三百字，最多的认识到四百字。她们也得到了不少新知识，文化水平提高了。
    第五、妇女入社以后，由于积极劳动，有了劳动成绩，因而转变了社会对妇女的歧视和妇女在家庭中受虐待的现象，改善了家庭关系。如青海互助县仲吉祥农业生产合作社的王顺清夫妇，过去常打架，不说话，影响了生产。他俩入社以后，女的劳动特别好，成绩很大。去年社内分红时计算，顺清有八十六个劳动日，他老婆则有一百十二个劳动日，两人共分得一千七百三十二斤主粮。从此夫妻和好了。又如该社女社员侯玉梅，从前婆媳关系不好。婆婆不把媳妇当人看待，媳妇也不愿好好劳动，家里闹得少吃没穿。侯玉梅入社以后，在大家教育下努力劳动，学会了药剂拌种、温汤浸种，也学会了扬场，分红时多分了粮食，婆媳关系好转了。这样的事实，使全体社员和附近群众都进一步认识到组织起来的好处。
    但是，各地合作社妇女工作的发展还是不平衡的。有的社对女社员的政治思想教育作得不够；有许多社不重视培养妇女骨干；有的社对女社员工分评的过低，不合同工同酬原则；有的是男组员怕妇女挣工分多，不给妇女分活；部分社把妇女劳动的工分和家里的工分统计在一起，使妇女不明白自己得了多少工分。这些问题，都应迅速求得合理解决。根据上述情况，我们认为可以从以下五方面来努力。
    第一、在建社以前要向妇女进行总路线的教育，打好思想基础。咸阳县冯保林互助组转社以前，对女组员的教育工作重视不够，认为做好男组员教育工作就可以转社。但到报名入社时，十一户中就有五户是妇女当家的。妇女思想上有顾虑，不同意入社。其他各户的妇女也对入社有意见，因而增加了阻力。以后向妇女们进行了教育，解决了她们的思想问题，她们就成了建社的重要力量。马廷海合作社开始建社时，动员男女一齐参加建社学习，讨论有关建社的各种文件，并采用家庭会议形式来动员，所以没有遇到大的阻力。因此，建社时必须对妇女进行很好的动员，使她们了解合作社对妇女的好处。同时要加强男女平等的教育，反对重男轻女的封建残余思想。此外，还应该经常对女社员用先进人物、英雄模范的新道德品质进行教育，克服女社员中狭隘、自私等落后思想，逐步树立集体主义思想。
    第二、培养社内妇女骨干，加强核心领导的力量。有些合作社虽然有女的当社长、副社长、委员、小组长等，但她们中有的人能力不强，缺少领导经验，更谈不上政治和思想的领导。因此，社的领导上应当具体帮助她们处理一些女社员中比较复杂的问题，让她们先独立处理一些比较简单的问题，逐步提高她们的办事能力。另外，还可在其家庭同意的原则下选送一批妇女骨干到县、区人民政府办的互助合作训练班去学习，提高她们的政策水平和领导能力，使她们能逐步懂得业务，真正负起自己应负的责任。
    第三、必须对男女劳动实行同工同酬，女社员的工分实行单独统计，按季总结妇女劳动成绩，好的给以表扬，鼓励她们继续努力。要彻底实现同工同酬的原则，一方面要靠妇女自己去争取，另方面必须克服某些男社员和领导干部中的封建思想和歧视妇女的现象。
      第四、根据女社员的特长和具体条件，实行男女分工，合理地使用女劳力。并采取小包工或按件记工等办法，把某些农活包给妇女。根据农活的种类、质量好坏、时间长短和做活多少，合理地评工记分。在农忙时可以组织抱娃娃组，使妇女减轻孩子的拖累。但褓姆工资应该由母亲和褓姆商定，由母亲付给，不能由社内负担。在收获季节，为了粮食不受损失，作到快收、快打，可以提倡互助做饭，使妇女腾出作饭的时间，参加田间生产。
    第五、帮助女社员积极学习先进耕作技术。通过集体劳动，使妇女认识组织起来是学习技术的好机会，只有提高了技术，才能赶上当前生产的需要。另外，还应该选拔社内一定数量的女积极分子，到人民政府办的技术传授训练班去学习，使她们学会一两种可在当地推广的先进技术，以便带动其他女社员，在社内开展互教互学运动。也只有使妇女们与男子一样掌握了技术，才能充分发挥妇女在农业生产中的作用。
