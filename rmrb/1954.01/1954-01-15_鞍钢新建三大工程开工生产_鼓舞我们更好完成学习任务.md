    Anshan Iron and Steel's New Three Major Projects Commence Production
    Inspiring Us to Better Complete Our Studies
    Wen Zhendong, a student from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, writes: The news of the commencement of production of Anshan Iron and Steel's new three major projects has greatly inspired the teaching enthusiasm of all faculty and students at the Institute. Especially those of us in the fourth grade, who interned in Anshan for a year, personally witnessed the growth of the three major projects. Some students even established deep relationships with many workers on site through joint labor, and therefore feel extremely excited.

    After the victorious commencement of production of the Large Rolling Mill and the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, all faculty and students of the Rolling Mill Department held a get-together. At the meeting, Department Head Yang Shangzhuo introduced to the students the great significance of the commencement of production of these two plants for the construction of the motherland and the close relationship with various majors at the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology. He also called on all students to work hard for the iron and steel industry of the motherland. Yan Chengzong, a fourth-year student in the Rolling Mill Department, introduced the development of the two plants to everyone, saying: "When the Japanese devils left, they completely destroyed the equipment of these two plants; they said: 'This place will only grow sorghum in the future.' But today, with the selfless assistance of the Soviet elder brother, the Chinese working class has successfully built the two plants with their own hands." Comrade Yan Chengzong's words represent our love for the Anshan Iron and Steel workers and also express our confidence in building our own motherland.

    After returning from their internship in Anshan, the fourth-year students of the Iron Smelting Department wrote a letter to all the workers of No. 7 Blast Furnace, congratulating them on the great victory they had achieved in the labor of repairing the furnace. Many students, recalling the scene of the hard work of the workers of No. 7 Blast Furnace when they interned in Anshan, strengthened their determination to study hard. Four female students in the second year of the Iron Smelting Department confidently expressed that they would study hard and prepare to be like female blast furnace foreman Wu Yuanyu in the future, producing a large amount of high-quality pig iron for the motherland at their posts. They said that the new victories in the motherland's iron and steel industry require us to study well, exercise our bodies, and become qualified people's engineers, so as to better strive for the socialist industrialization of the motherland.

    Qiu Chunlin, a student in the Rolling Mill Department, writes: The construction of the motherland is developing rapidly. The great victory of the motherland in socialist industrialization makes us even more aware of the great responsibility of ourselves—the new type of intellectuals from the working people. The fact that I was able to complete six years of study in three years at the Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School and enter a university shows that we are capable of mastering cultural science. The commencement of production of Anshan Iron and Steel's three major projects is just the beginning. The large-scale iron and steel industry of the motherland is still waiting for us to create. For the cause of communism, for the future happiness of the people, I am determined to study scientific knowledge even harder, carry forward the fighting spirit of the working people in overcoming difficulties, and, under the leadership of the Party, the guidance of the teachers, and the help of the students, tenaciously overcome the difficulties in learning, so that I can become the iron and steel engineer that the people of the motherland expect, with both high political consciousness and scientific and technological level. We firmly believe that we will be able to conquer the scientific fortress and complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    鞍钢新建三大工程开工生产
    鼓舞我们更好完成学习任务
    北京钢铁工业学院学生闻振东来信：鞍钢新建三大工程开工生产的消息，大大地鼓舞着我们钢铁工业学院全院师生的教学热情。特别是我们四年级全体同学在鞍山实习了一年，亲眼看到了三大工程的成长，有的同学还与现场的许多工人在共同劳动中建立了深厚的感情，因而更感到无比的兴奋。
    当大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂胜利开工生产的消息传来之后，轧钢专业的全体师生举办了一次联欢晚会。会上杨尚灼系主任给同学们介绍了这两厂开工对祖国建设的伟大意义和对北京钢铁工业学院各专业的密切关系，并号召全体同学为祖国的钢铁事业而努力学习。轧钢专业四年级同学阎承宗向大家介绍两厂发展的情况时说：“日本鬼子临走的时候，把这两个厂的设备完全破坏了；他们说：‘将来这块地方只能长高粱。’可是今天在苏联老大哥无私的援助下，中国的工人阶级用自己的双手把两个厂修建成功了。”阎承宗同学的话，代表着我们对鞍钢职工同志的热爱，也表示出了我们对建设自己祖国的信心。
    炼铁四年级同学从鞍山实习回来后，曾给七号炼铁炉全体职工写了一封信，祝贺他们在修炉的劳动中所取得的巨大的胜利。许多同学回想起在鞍钢实习时亲眼看到七号炼铁炉的职工艰苦劳作的情景，更加强了自己努力学习的决心。炼铁二年级的四位女同学充满信心地表示要努力学习，准备将来像女炼铁炉炉长吴元喻同志那样，在工作岗位上为祖国生产大量的优质生铁。她们说，祖国钢铁事业上的新胜利，要求我们学好功课，锻炼身体，成为一个合乎要求的人民工程师，更好地为祖国的社会主义工业化而奋斗。
    轧钢系学生仇春霖来信：祖国的建设事业正在突飞猛进地发展着。祖国在社会主义工业化方面的伟大胜利，使我们更加认识到自己——劳动人民出身的新型知识分子——责任的重大。我在工农速成中学能在三年内完成了六年的学习任务，并进入高等学校学习，正说明了我们是能够掌握文化科学的。鞍钢的三大工程的开工生产这仅仅是开始，祖国的大规模的钢铁工业还待我们去创建。为了共产主义事业，为了人民未来的幸福，我决心更加努力地学习科学知识，发扬劳动人民克服困难的战斗精神，在党的领导、老师的教导和同学们的帮助下，顽强地克服学习中的困难，使自己成为祖国人民所期望的，既具有高度政治觉悟又具有科学技术水平的钢铁工程师。我们坚信自己一定能够攻克科学堡垒，完成党交给我们的任务。
