(Xinhua News Agency, January 15th) According to Vietnam News Agency: As the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month is about to begin, Hoang Minh Giam, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, published an article expressing gratitude to the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries for their support of Vietnam's resistance war.

Hoang Minh Giam said that in early 1950, the governments of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This historic event greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people, and since then, Vietnam has designated January 18th as the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations with friendly countries. Every year on January 18th, it is an exciting and joyful day for the Vietnamese people.

Hoang Minh Giam continued, this year, the Vietnamese people will welcome January 18th with even more excitement and joy, because on this day they will begin holding the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month.

Currently, people across Vietnam are actively preparing for the Friendship Month. I believe that the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month will achieve brilliant success and will help the Vietnamese people gain a deeper understanding of the brotherly countries and further learn from their valuable experiences.

Hoang Minh Giam said that the friendship of the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries to the Vietnamese people is precious. As President Ho Chi Minh said, this friendship is a reliable guarantee for the victory of our long-term, arduous, and self-reliant resistance war; it also further strengthens our confidence in the bright future of the just struggle against the French colonialists and American interventionists.

Hoang Minh Giam concluded by saying that the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month will strengthen the unity between the Vietnamese people and the brotherly countries, further enhance the Vietnamese people's patriotism and internationalism, and encourage them to complete the two central tasks put forward by President Ho Chi Minh: to advance the resistance war and implement land reform, in order to regain national independence and unification and make a positive contribution to the cause of safeguarding world peace.

    越南黄明鉴外长撰文迎接“越苏中友好月”
    感谢苏联、中国和人民民主国家支持越南抗战
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：在越苏中友好月即将到来的时候，越南民主共和国外交部部长黄明鉴发表文章，表示感谢苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家人民对越南抗战的支持。
    黄明鉴说，在一九五零年初，苏联、中华人民共和国以及其他人民民主国家政府承认了越南民主共和国。这一历史事件大大鼓舞了越南人民，以后越南就把一月十八日定为与各友好国家建立邦交的纪念日。每年的一月十八日，对于越南人民说来，都是一个兴奋、愉快的日子。
    黄明鉴继续说，今年，越南人民将以更兴奋、更愉快的心情来迎接一月十八日，因为在这一天他们将开始举行越苏中友好月。
    目前越南全国各地人民已在积极筹备这个友好月的工作。我相信，越苏中友好月将获得辉煌的成就，并将有助于越南人民对兄弟国家获得更深的了解，进一步学习它们的宝贵经验。
    黄明鉴说，苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家对越南人民的友谊是宝贵的。正如胡志明主席所说，这种友谊，对于我们长期的、艰苦的、自力更生的抗战的胜利是一个可靠的保证；它也进一步加强了我们对于反对法国殖民者和美国干涉者的正义斗争的光辉前途的信心。
    黄明鉴最后说，越苏中友好月将加强越南人民和兄弟国家之间的团结，进一步提高越南人民的爱国主义和国际主义精神，并且鼓舞他们去完成胡志明主席所提出的两项中心任务：推进抗战和实行土地改革，以便重新取得民族独立和统一，并对保卫世界和平的事业作出积极的贡献。
