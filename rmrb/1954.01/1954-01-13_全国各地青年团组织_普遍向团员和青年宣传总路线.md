    Youth League Organizations Across the Country
    Universally Promote the General Line to League Members and Youth
    The organizations of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in cities and rural areas across the country have universally carried out the propaganda and education of the general line among Youth League members and the broad masses of young people, enhancing the understanding of the broad masses of young people about the socialist future of the motherland and vigorously promoting the work of the League.
    Since mid-November of last year, Youth League organizations at all levels have successively held various meetings and used various methods to train grassroots cadres and activists. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Youth League held a lecture for Youth League cadres of various systems in the city, and 20,000 cadres received training. In Henan Province, by mid-December of last year, more than 595,000 Youth League backbone members had received education through various meetings. In rural areas of Shaanxi Province, each Youth League branch had one to three League backbone members participating in the study. Youth League organizations in various places have arranged their future work in accordance with the spirit of the general line, requiring that the propaganda of the general line must be linked with educating young people to love labor, with young people's study, and with cultivating young people's patriotism and internationalism, and it must also be linked with the spirit of communism, educating young people to love public property, care about the collective, be friendly and help each other, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, young people should be educated to develop good living habits and styles.
    In the propaganda of the general line, Youth League organizations in various places carried out propaganda activities according to the characteristics of young people, which yielded great results. Youth League organizations in North China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the provinces and cities of Suiyuan, Zhejiang, Jilin, Shenyang, Fushun, and Dalian generally conducted education for League members through League classes or League organizational life. Many places used the example of advanced figures to call on young people to learn. Youth League organizations in Shanghai, Anshan, Shenyang, Fushun and other places introduced to the broad masses of young people the deeds of Wang Chonglun, a nationally famous young advanced worker and special-class labor model in Anshan, who completed four years of production quota in one year, which was very popular among young people. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Youth League widely publicized to rural youth the example of Youth League member Hua Haiquan persuading his family to sell grain to the state, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of rural youth to mobilize their families to sell grain. In addition, Youth League organizations in factories, schools and government offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Fushun, Hangzhou, Jinan and other places also adopted methods such as picture exhibitions, speeches, symposiums, and organizing young people to read relevant literary books and watch movies to carry out the propaganda of the general line. In rural areas, many grassroots League organizations used the method of comparison and detailed accounting in winter schools and people's schools to help young farmers understand the benefits of taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation.
    After the education of the general line, Youth League members and the broad masses of young people in various cities, factories, and mines recognized the great significance of the socialist industrialization of the motherland, as well as their role and great responsibility in national construction, and were therefore encouraged, and their production enthusiasm was greatly improved. Jiang Deyin, a young worker at the state-owned Chongqing 102 Steel Plant, said: Heavy industry is like the bones of a person, without it, socialism cannot be built successfully. Under the guidance of this correct thinking, the production team he led created a new record of blowing 14 furnaces of steel a day, and 100% guaranteed the quality. Wang Minxia, a young worker at Shanghai Xinhua Steel Plant, used to complain that the quota was too high, but after studying the general line, she overfulfilled the production task by 80% when making two-inch pipe elbows. Zhou Zhongren, a young worker at Jinan Diesel Engine Factory, used to produce defective products every month, and thought "there is nothing great about it." Now he feels that "if everyone produces so many defective products, it will not only waste the country's property, but also affect the rapid development of the country's industrial construction." So he changed his labor attitude, and since November of last year, he has not produced a single defective product. In addition, some young workers and shop assistants in Shanghai, Tianjin and other places, after studying, criticized the idea of not wanting to work in private factories and shops, and realized that they were shouldering the glorious task of guiding private industry and commerce to take the road of state capitalism, and their production and work enthusiasm was also higher.
    Many Youth League members and young people in rural areas also improved their ideological understanding after studying the general line. Many Youth League members criticized their wrong thinking of not being at ease with agricultural production. Li Yeqing, a Youth League branch committee member of Shahe Township, Yiqu District, Licheng County, Shandong Province, used to feel that engaging in agriculture was meaningless. Zhang Xirong, a Youth League member of Shanggao Township, Jiuqu District, Tai'an County, used to think that it was the same whether or not he participated in the mutual aid group. Liu Furu, a Youth League member of Tongxing Village, Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, felt that "peasants are unpromising" and even resigned from the position of mutual aid group leader and sold his plow horse. After studying, they all realized that "to engage in industry without engaging in agriculture is missing a leg", and that mutual aid groups are "seedlings of socialism". Only by organizing everyone to develop production and supply industry with grain and raw materials can industry supply farmers with machines, so that they can advance to the socialist road. Under the education of the general line, Youth League members and young people in many places not only mobilized their families to sell surplus grain, but also actively carried out winter production, organized production teams for collecting manure, gathering firewood, winter plowing, and reclaiming wasteland, and many teams also launched competitions.
    After studying, Youth League members and young people in various government offices and schools have improved their work and study enthusiasm. Students of the Tianjin No. 7 Girls' Middle School have set off a wave of studying the general line in the whole school. Li Shulian, an overseas Chinese student who had just returned from overseas, said excitedly: "I returned to the motherland and caught up with the great construction period of the motherland. I must study diligently and gradually become an excellent talent for building the motherland."
    The propaganda and education of the general line has vigorously promoted the consolidation and growth of Youth League organizations in various places and strengthened the work of the League. Many local League organizations conducted commendations and criticisms through work inspections, absorbed outstanding young activists into the Youth League, and seriously dealt with individual Youth League members who violated laws and regulations and colluded with unscrupulous merchants to engage in speculation and profiteering. The League organizations in some provinces and cities have further strengthened the work of the Youth League in the economic departments and improved and strengthened the work of the League's grassroots organizations.

    全国各地青年团组织
    普遍向团员和青年宣传总路线
    中国新民主主义青年团在全国各地城市和农村中的组织，普遍地向青年团员和广大青年开展了总路线的宣传教育，提高了广大青年对祖国的社会主义前途的认识，有力地推动了团的工作。
    自去年十一月中旬开始，青年团各级组织先后召开了各种会议，并运用各种方式训练了基层干部和积极分子。青年团沈阳市委员会举办了全市各系统青年团干部讲座，有两万名干部受到了训练。河南省到去年十二月中旬止，有五十九万五千多名团员骨干分子，通过各种会议受到了教育。陕西省农村中每个团支部都有一名到三名团的骨干参加了学习。各地青年团的组织都根据总路线的精神布置了今后工作，要求总路线的宣传必须和教育青年热爱劳动联系起来，和青年的学习联系起来，和培养青年的爱国主义与国际主义的思想联系起来，也必须和共产主义精神联系起来，教育青年热爱公共财物，关心集体，友爱互助，开展批评与自我批评，同时要教育青年养成良好的生活习惯和作风。
    在总路线的宣传中，各地青年团组织根据青年特点开展了宣传活动，收效很大。华北区、内蒙古自治区和绥远、浙江、吉林、沈阳、抚顺、旅大等省、市的青年团组织，普遍地通过团课或团的组织生活向团员进行教育。有许多地方运用先进人物的榜样，号召青年学习。上海、鞍山、沈阳、抚顺等地青年团组织，都向广大青年介绍了全国著名的青年先进工人、鞍山市特等劳动模范王崇伦一年完成四年生产定额的事迹，极受青年们的欢迎。青年团浙江省委员会向农村青年广泛宣传了青年团员华海泉说服家庭把粮食卖给国家的事例，大大地鼓舞了农村青年动员家庭卖粮的热情。此外，北京、上海、武汉、广州、西安、抚顺、杭州、济南等地工厂、学校和机关中的团组织，还分别采取图片展览，演讲会、座谈会以及组织青年阅读有关文艺书籍和看电影的方法，进行总路线的宣传。农村中不少团的基层组织，在冬学和民校中用对比、算细账的办法，帮助青年农民认识走互助合作的道路的好处。
    经过总路线的教育，各城市和工厂、矿山中的青年团员和广大青年认清了祖国的社会主义工业化的重大意义，以及自己在国家建设中的作用和重大责任，因而受到鼓舞，生产积极性大大提高。国营重庆一零二钢铁厂青年工人蒋德银说：重工业像人身上的骨头一样，离开它，社会主义是不会建设成功的。在他这种正确思想的指导下，他所领导的生产小组创造了日吹十四炉钢的新纪录，并且百分之百地保证了质量。上海新沪钢铁厂青年工人王敏霞，过去埋怨定额太高，但学习总路线后，在做二寸管子弯头时，超额百分之八十完成了生产任务。济南柴油机厂青年工人周忠仁，过去月月出废品，还认为“没有什么了不起”。现在他感觉到“如果大家都出这样多的废品，不仅浪费国家的财物，而且影响国家工业建设的迅速发展”。于是改变了劳动态度，从去年十一月以来，没出一件废品。此外，上海、天津等地有些青年工人和店员经过学习后，批判了不愿在私营工厂和商店中工作的思想，认识到自己正是负担着引导私营工商业走国家资本主义道路的光荣任务，生产和工作热情也更加高涨。
    各地农村中许多青年团员和青年，在学习总路线后也提高了思想认识。不少青年团员批判了自己不安心农业生产的错误思想。山东省历城县一区沙河乡青年团支部委员李业清过去感到搞农业没有意思，泰安县九区上高乡青年团员张锡荣过去认为参加不参加互助组一样干活。黑龙江省龙江县同兴村青年团员刘福如觉得“庄稼人没出息”，甚至辞去了互助组长的职务，并卖掉自己的耕马。经过学习后，他们都认识到“搞工业不搞农业是缺少一条腿”，互助组是“社会主义的苗子”，只有大家组织起来发展生产，供给工业粮食和原料，工业才能供给农民机器，这样才能向社会主义道路前进。许多地方的农村青年团员和青年，在总路线的教育下，不仅动员家庭卖出余粮，并且积极开展冬季生产，组织拾粪、打柴、冬耕、开荒等生产小组，有许多小组还开展了竞赛。
    各地机关、学校中的青年团员和青年经过学习后，工作和学习热情都有了提高。天津市第七女子中学的学生，已在全校掀起学习总路线热潮。华侨学生李淑莲刚从海外归国不久，她非常激动地说：
  “我回到祖国，就赶上祖国伟大建设时期，我一定要勤奋地学习，使自己逐渐成为建设祖国的优秀人材。”
    总路线的宣传教育，有力地推动了各地青年团组织的巩固和壮大，加强了团的工作。许多地方团的组织通过检查工作，进行了表扬和批评，吸收了优秀的青年积极分子加入青年团，并严肃处理了个别违法乱纪、勾结奸商进行投机倒把的青年团员。部分省、市的团组织，还进一步加强了青年团在经济部门中的工作，改进和加强了团的基层组织的工作。
