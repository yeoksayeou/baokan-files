Guangxi Province's grain procurement work, as of January 11th, had seen 500 townships complete grain delivery into warehouses, with over 2,000 other townships actively delivering grain. During this period, many regions emphasized grain storage work, but some regions adopted an extremely irresponsible attitude towards it. For example, the procurement team of Guolao Township, Third District, Jingxi County, casually piled the purchased rice on the stage in the market, exposing it to wind and rain, soaking the grain. Cadres of the Liangshi Grain Company in Tianxi Township, Seventh District, Longjin County, placed the purchased rice in the shelter at the train station, without closing the doors and windows. Grain kernels were scattered all over the ground, mixed with large amounts of chicken droppings and horse manure.

Preliminary inspections in various areas have revealed that many granaries, due to neglecting storage work, have caused significant losses to state grain. For example, in Guiping County's county seat, Jiangkou, Baisha, Dawan Tang, and the entire county's Chengguan, and in the county seat of Xing'an County, the grain temperature generally reached 30 to 37 degrees Celsius, with the highest exceeding 40 degrees Celsius, and the grain had begun to rot. Recently, Sixth District of Huanjiang County and Fulu Township of Sanjiang County both experienced warehouse collapse accidents, resulting in grain losses. Some granaries have also experienced grain suffering from insect infestation and rat gnawing.

The reason for these accidents is mainly that some granary cadres lack the necessary sense of responsibility for state property. However, the leadership organs of Party committees and governments in many places relaxed their leadership over grain storage work during this period, which is also an important reason. Currently, leadership in areas such as Xing'an has begun to take emergency measures to actively rectify warehouse storage work, but some regions still do not pay enough attention to this issue. This phenomenon should be corrected immediately.

    广西部分仓库忽视粮食保管工作应即纠正
    广西省收购粮食工作，截至一月十一日止，已有五百个乡全部送粮入库，另有二千多个乡正在积极送粮。在这个期间，许多地区重视了粮食保管工作，但有部分地区对粮食保管工作采取了极不负责的态度。如靖西县第三区果老乡收购组把收购来的稻谷随便堆放在市场里的戏台上，任其风吹雨淋，把谷都浸湿了。龙津县第七区天西乡粮食公司的干部将收购来的稻谷放在车站的墟亭里，门窗也不关，谷粒撒了满地，掺杂上大批鸡屎、马粪。
    各地初步检查发现，不少粮库因为忽视保管工作，已使国家粮食受到不少损失。如桂平县的县城、江口、白沙、大湾塘，全县的城关，兴安县的县城等地的粮食仓库，一般的粮食温度高达三十度到三十七度，最高的达四十度以上，粮食已开始霉坏。环江县第六区、三江县富禄乡最近都曾发生仓房倒塌事故，损失了粮食。有的粮库还发生了粮食遭受虫蛀、鼠噬的现象。
    发生这些事故的原因，主要是部分粮库干部对国家财产缺乏应有的责任心。但是许多地方的党委、政府领导机关在这个期间放松了对粮食保管工作的领导，也是一个重要原因。目前，兴安等地领导方面已开始采取紧急措施，积极整顿仓库保管工作，但是仍有一些地区对这一问题还不够重视。这种现象，应即纠正。
