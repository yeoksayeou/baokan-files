Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th. Our special correspondent reports: American authorities in Seoul and Panmunjom today, through their propaganda machines, openly exerted strong pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force, stating that if the prisoners of war were not "released" by January 23, the United States would allow Syngman Rhee's army to enter the demilitarized zone to forcibly seize the prisoners of war. Yesterday, officials in Washington also stubbornly insisted that the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in the Korean demilitarized zone must be "released" from January 23.

Following the Syngman Rhee clique's "cabinet" decision on the 4th to send troops to "release" the prisoners of war, the United States immediately encouraged it. An Associated Press dispatch from Korea on the 6th, quoting "qualified observers," stated that if Syngman Rhee's army entered the demilitarized zone and opened the barbed wire prison camps, the United States army would not prevent it and "probably take no action." The Associated Press dispatch from Seoul also explained that the United States would allow Syngman Rhee to repeat the perfidious incident of forcibly detaining prisoners of war last June. The message said, "When South Korea 'released' 27,000 North Korean prisoners of war from the UN forces' South Korean prisoner of war camps last summer, the United States army did not take any preventive action."

The United States and Syngman Rhee are colluding together to make these threatening noises, the purpose of which is obviously to pressure the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force not to perform their duties according to their "scope of authority," but to allow the United States to realize its criminal plan to forcibly detain the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. American officials in Washington openly threatened on the 5th that if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission decided that the prisoners of war should not be "released," the Indian Custodial Force would be subjected to "violent acts" created by U.S. agents in the camps. An Associated Press dispatch from Panmunjom on the 6th also quoted "qualified observers" as bluntly saying that if the Indian troops delayed the release of prisoners of war, it would cause "bloody mass escapes" or "South Korean troops forcibly breaking through the Indian Custodial Force to release these prisoners of war."

    美方公然表示允许李承晚武力劫夺战俘
   【新华社开城六日电】本社特派记者报道：汉城及板门店的美国当局今天都通过其宣传机器，公然对中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队施加强大压力，表示如果战俘在一月二十三日未获“释放”，美国将允许李承晚军队进入非军事区以武力劫夺战俘。昨天，华盛顿官方人士也横蛮地一口咬定，朝鲜非军事区的朝中战俘必须在一月二十三日起“获得释放”。
    在李承晚集团“内阁”四日决定要派军队来“释放”战俘以后，美国方面马上加以鼓励。合众社六日自朝鲜发出的消息，引用“有资格的观察家”的话说，如果李承晚军队进入非军事区打开围着铁丝网的战俘营场，美国军队将不予制止，“可能不采取任何行动”。合众社汉城消息并且说明，美国将使李承晚在去年六月强迫扣留战俘的背信弃义事件重演。这个消息说，“当去年夏天南朝鲜从联军看管的南朝鲜战俘营里‘释放’二万七千名北朝鲜战俘时，美国军队并没有采取任何制止行动。”
    美国和李承晚勾结在一起进行这些威胁性的叫嚷，其目的显然是压迫中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队不根据“职权范围”执行其职责，而听任美方实现其强迫扣留朝中战俘的罪恶计划。华盛顿美国官方人士五日公开恫吓说，如果中立国遣返委员会决定战俘不应“释放”，印度看管部队就要遭到美方特务在营场中制造的“暴力行为”。合众社板门店六日电也引用“有资格的观察家”的话露骨地说，印度部队如果延迟释放战俘，就会引起“流血的集体逃跑”，或者“南朝鲜军队以武力冲过印度看管部队来释放这些战俘”。
