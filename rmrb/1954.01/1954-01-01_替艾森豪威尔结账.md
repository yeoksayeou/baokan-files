Settling Accounts for Eisenhower
Xiao Yu

On January 20th of last year, Eisenhower, on his very first day after climbing onto the presidential seat, boasted that he would use his "belief" to connect "the farmers of Burma," "the shepherds of Southern Italy," "the mountain dwellers of the Andes," and "the wheat growers of Iowa," and proclaimed that his government was "destined to shoulder the leadership responsibility of the free world." However, time flies, and 1953 has rushed past. During this year, what exactly has this figure, who was "destined" to lead the so-called "free world," accomplished? Recently, Marvin Stone, the Far East Bureau Chief of the U.S. International News Service, and Russell Brines, an Associated Press reporter who followed U.S. Vice President Nixon on his "tour" of the East, have provided Eisenhower with considerable material in this regard.

According to Associated Press reporter Brines' report on December 19th of last year:
“After Nixon traveled 45,000 miles in the world,”
“he brought President Eisenhower very troublesome problems for the election year.” Brines said: "The U.S. government is attempting to cut expenditures before the crucial congressional elections to be held this November," but Nixon believes that the United States "cannot but spend more money and intervene more forcefully" in the Far East issue in order to stop the expanding Asian people's liberation movement.

How much money has the U.S. government spent in the Far East in the past year? What effects have been achieved? This is a difficult account to calculate.

Looking at the Korean War launched by the U.S. aggressors, according to "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, the U.S. expenditures directly related to this war and the arms race started because of this war amounted to as much as $80 billion. But what was the result? On June 7th of last year, Eisenhower himself openly admitted in a letter to Syngman Rhee: "Neither prolonging the current war nor rashly launching a new war" can achieve the goal of invading Korea; the New York "Daily Mirror" made a note on Eisenhower's speech saying: This is "the first real defeat the United States has suffered in Korea in history." Not only that, but "in the upcoming political conference, we (the United States) will also not be able to act according to our own will" ("New York Herald Tribune").

It is like this in Korea, and it is also like this in other parts of Asia. Let's look at the situation in Vietnam. When the French aggressor troops were being badly beaten by the Vietnamese People's Army, the United States did indeed "forcefully" intervene. According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on December 19th of last year, the United States' expenditure on the Indochina war in 1953 would exceed $1 billion; but what was the result? Associated Press reporter Larry Allen believes that "this war often seems like a hopeless war." Since 1946, the U.S. government has invested $2 billion in the Philippines, but when U.S. officials inspected the results of 1953, they found that "there were hardly any achievements" (International News Service Tokyo, November 29, 1953). Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit gang fugitive in Taiwan, was the most disappointing. More than 10,000 men trained and equipped by the United States launched a sneak attack on Dongshan Island, but as a result, "they tried to steal a chicken but lost the rice instead," losing more than 3,000 and fleeing in disgrace. Therefore, Marvin Stone also sighed: Even such "hit-and-run" attacks were unsuccessful.

What about the situation in Japan? Over the past year, U.S. officials Dulles, Nolan, and others have been busily traveling back and forth between Washington and Tokyo, wholeheartedly trying to get rearmament started as soon as possible. In early October of last year, the U.S. government also summoned Yoshida's representative, Hayato Ikeda, to Washington and ordered Tokyo to expand its army to 350,000 in the shortest possible time. However, "by December 1953, Japan still reluctantly stated that the 'defense forces' it would provide in five years would not exceed 180,000," and the Japanese people's "anti-Americanism has risen to an unprecedented height." Marvin Stone also had to admit that 1953 was "a year of setbacks" for the U.S. aggressors in Japan.

Asia is like this, how about Europe? It's not good either. The "European Army" has not been pieced together yet, which is one of the U.S. government's most anxious problems. In early December of last year, when the "European Army" issue was discussed at the Bermuda Conference, French Prime Minister Laniel, fearing opposition from the domestic people and fearing losing his votes in the next presidential election, used "a cold" as an excuse for not attending. This made Dulles angry. He said at a press conference in Paris that if the European Army could not be established, "the United States would have to disturbingly re-estimate its basic policies," and declared that half of the U.S. military aid to Europe would be "withheld" from the next fiscal year (July 1954) onwards (Reuters Paris, December 14, 1953). However, Dulles' threat did not take effect. On December 16th of last year, a resolution passed by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly stated that no foreign interference could affect the decisions of the French Parliament. In 1953, the "European Army" plan of the U.S. aggressors became a bubble again.

Over the past year, the U.S. government has spent money and extended its claws in many places. But who has Eisenhower connected with according to his own "belief"? What is the "leadership" situation of the United States in the so-called "free world"? A recent issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine published in December of last year admitted: "In France, as far as its relationship with the United States is concerned, the forces alienating the United States are strong and are constantly growing," "Allies tired of the tense situation have become so relaxed that they have begun to disintegrate." The magazine also said: The United States has invested $40 billion abroad in the past eight years, and will invest more than $14.5 billion this year (ending in June 1954), but the response from the United States' "friends" is "increasingly indifferent to U.S. leadership." Not only does the United States have no "leadership position" in the so-called "free world," but "the prestige of the United States among the European people has never been as low as it is now" (Senator Lehman's words). As early as March of last year, the "Washington News" also admitted that U.S. money cannot buy any friendship abroad. In the U.S. so-called "free world," anti-American sentiment is rising, and almost in every country that feels threatened by U.S. power, the slogan "Americans go home!" can be seen written in chalk on buildings and walls.

The facts of the past year prove that Eisenhower's "belief" has not connected anyone. On the contrary, the people of all countries have become more united in opposing Eisenhower's "belief." Therefore, neither any U.S. kept journalist, nor any U.S. official who has "toured" Europe and Asia, can provide Eisenhower with good materials for the year-end settlement.

    替艾森豪威尔结账
    萧羽
    去年一月二十日，艾森豪威尔刚爬上总统位子的第一天，曾吹嘘要用他的“信念”把“缅甸的农民”、“南意大利的牧人”、“安达斯的山地居民”和“衣阿华州的种麦人”联系在一起，并且声称他的政府“命定了要担负起自由世界的领导责任”。但是，时光如流，一九五三年匆匆地过去了。在这
  一年中，这位“命定了”要领导所谓“自由世界”的人物，究竟有些什么作为呢？最近，美国国际新闻社远东分社社长马文·斯通和跟随美国副总统尼克松“游历”东方的美联社记者拉塞尔·布林斯等人，都在这方面给艾森豪威尔提供了不少材料。
    据美联社记者布林斯去年十二月十九日报道：
  “尼克松在世界上旅行了四万五千英里之后”，
  “给艾森豪威尔总统带来了选举年的非常伤脑筋的问题”。布林斯说：“美国政府正企图在今年十一月举行关系重大的国会选举之前削减开支”，而尼克松却认为美国在远东问题上“不能不再化一些钱，更有力地插一手”，以便阻止正在扩展的亚洲人民解放运动。
    美国政府一年来在远东究竟化了多少钱？得到了那些效果？这却是一笔不大好算的账目。
    就美国侵略者发动的侵朝战争来看，据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说，美国直接与这个战争有关的和由于这个战争而开始的军备竞赛的开支，高达八百亿美元。然而结果怎样呢？去年六月七日艾森豪威尔本人在给李承晚的信里就曾公开承认：“不论延长目前的战争或冒失地发动新战争”，都不能达到侵占朝鲜的目的；纽约“每日镜报”，曾针对着艾森豪威尔的发言下了一个注解说：这是“美国在朝鲜受到了历史上第一次真正的失败”。不仅这样，而且“在即将来临的政治会议中我们（美国）也将不能按照自己的意志行事”（“纽约先驱论坛报”）。
    在朝鲜是这样，在亚洲其他地方也是这样。我们看看越南的情况，当法国侵略军被越南人民军打得落花流水的时候，美国的确也“有力地”插来一手。据美联社去年十二月十九日华盛顿电讯估计，一九五三年美国用在印度支那战争上的支出，将超过十亿美元；但是结果呢？美联社的记者拉里·艾伦认为，“这个战争经常看来是一个没有希望的战争”。自一九四六年以来，美国政府已在菲律宾投下了二十亿美元，但当美国官员检查一九五三年的结果时发现，“成绩简直没有”（国际新闻社东京一九五三年十一月二十九日电）。台湾的亡命匪徒蒋介石最不争气了，美国煞费苦心训练装备起来的一万多人马来偷袭东山岛，结果“偷鸡不着，失了米一把”，损失了三千多，狼狈而逃。因此，马文·斯通也叹息：就连这样“‘打了就跑’的偷袭也遭到失败”。
    日本的情况怎样呢？一年来，美国官员杜勒斯、诺兰等人，仆仆风尘，往返于华盛顿和东京道上，一心要把重新武装早点搞起来。去年十月初，美国政府还把吉田的代表池田勇人召到华盛顿去，命令东京在最短期间扩充三十五万陆军，但是，“到一九五三年十二月，日本仍旧勉强地表示在五年中提供的‘防御部队’不超过十八万人”，而且日本人民的“反美主义上涨到空前未有的高度”。马文·斯通也不得不承认，一九五三年是美国侵略者在日本“遭受挫折的一年”。
    亚洲是这样，欧洲怎样呢？同样不妙。“欧洲军”到现在仍没有拼凑起来，这是美国政府最感焦虑的问题之一。去年十二月初，在百慕大会议上讨论到“欧洲军”问题的时候，法国总理拉尼埃，因为害怕国内人民的反对，害怕失掉自己下届总统的选票，借口“伤风”不敢出席。这件事却使杜勒斯发了火，他在巴黎记者招待会上说，如果欧洲军成立不起来，“美国将不得不令人不安地重新估计一下它的基本政策”，并声言要从下一会计年度（一九五四年七月）起，美国给予欧洲的军事援助的一半“将予扣发”（路透社巴黎一九五三年十二月十四日电）。可是，杜勒斯的威胁并没有生效，去年十二月十六日，法国国民议会外交委员会通过的一项决议说：任何外国干涉都不能影响法国议会的决定。一九五三年，美国侵略者的“欧洲军”计划又成了泡影。
    一年来，美国政府的钱也化了，在许多地方也伸进了它的魔爪。但是，艾森豪威尔按照自己的“信念”联系到了什么人呢？美国对所谓“自由世界”的“领导”情况怎样呢？去年十二月出版的一期“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志承认：“在法国，就其与美国的联系而论，疏远美国的力量是强大的，并且是在不断地增长的，”“厌倦了紧张局势的盟国，已经松懈到开始分崩离析了”。这个杂志并且说：美国在过去八年中对国外的投资达四百亿美元，本年度（至一九五四年六月止）又投资一百四十五亿多美元，但是，美国的“朋友们”的回答，则是“对美国的领导日益冷淡”。美国在所谓“自由世界”中不仅没有什么“领导地位”，而且在欧洲人民中间，美国的威信从来也没有目前这样低落过”（美国参议员利曼语）。早在去年三月，“华盛顿新闻报”也承认过：美国的金钱不能在国外买到任何友谊。在美国所谓的“自由世界”之中，反美国的情绪正在高涨，而且几乎在每一个感到美国势力威胁的国家里，在建筑物和墙上都可以看到用粉笔写的“美国人滚回去！”的标语。
    过去一年的事实证明，艾森豪威尔的“信念”并没有把任何人联系起来，恰恰相反，倒是各国人民更加团结起来反对艾森豪威尔的“信念”了。因此，不管是美国的任何一位御用记者，或是在欧洲和亚洲“游历”过的美国任何一个官员，都不能给艾森豪威尔提供一些年终结账的好材料。
