Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The Soviet people are using various methods to strengthen cultural cooperation with people of other countries.

In terms of mutual delegation visits, over the past two years, more than 800 delegations from over 60 countries around the world have visited the Soviet Union. Art troupes from China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and other countries have successively visited and performed in various Soviet cities. The Soviet Union has also sent many delegations, theater troupes, song and dance ensembles and sports groups to foreign countries at the invitation of foreign mass organizations. Soviet representatives have visited Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Albania, the German Democratic Republic, Austria, Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, the United Kingdom and other countries.

Soviet literary and art circles often introduce foreign literary and artistic works. In the field of art, plays by foreign playwrights occupy an important position in the programs of Soviet theaters. Shakespeare's plays are staged more often and more regularly in Soviet theaters than in the United Kingdom. Plays by Goldoni, Lope de Vega, Schiller, Sheridan and Shaw are also frequently staged in the Soviet Union. In addition to Russian classical music and music by Soviet composers, music by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Handel, Strauss and many other European composers is also very popular with Soviet audiences. Soviet theaters are currently rehearsing more than 30 operas and more than 30 foreign operettas. The Soviet Union publishes dozens of types of scores by foreign composers every year. Museums in Moscow, Leningrad and other Soviet cities house valuable works by famous artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo, Titian and Da Vinci.

In terms of literature, the Soviet Union has published 1,600 works by foreign writers. Soviet publishing houses have published approximately 247 million copies of works by foreign writers during the Soviet era, of which approximately 86 million copies were published after the Second World War. Soviet publishing houses have published works by 416 French writers and 218 British writers. Works by 211 American writers have been published in the Soviet Union in more than 48 million copies (of which more than 13.2 million copies have been published in the post-war years). Works by 283 German writers have been published in the Soviet Union in 34 million copies. The Soviet Union has also published works by 69 Italian writers, 36 Chinese writers, 33 Spanish writers, 27 Danish writers, 26 Swedish writers, 21 Norwegian writers and 10 Finnish writers. These works are all published in various Soviet languages.

In addition, Soviet representatives have also gone abroad to participate in many international academic conferences. Foreign art exhibitions are often held domestically, and various exhibitions and celebrations are organized to commemorate outstanding representatives of the world's culture, science and art, in order to vigorously strengthen international cultural cooperation.
