Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 27th: Heavy snow has whitened the banks of the Hanshui River. Workers building the Hanshui Iron Bridge are braving the severe cold to rush the construction of the bridge's underwater foundation, so that the piers can be built above the water before the flood season arrives in March.

Since the commencement of the Hanshui Iron Bridge project nearly two months ago, the earthwork at the bridgeheads, the bridge abutments on land, and the pile driving for the foundation of the No. 1 pier have been completed ahead of schedule according to the plan. Workers are currently piling sand and accumulating stones, and pouring concrete for the bridge abutments. At the same time, the water-based work zone, responsible for the construction of the No. 4 and No. 5 piers in the center of the river and the No. 3 and No. 6 piers on both sides of the river, has been established, and the water-based construction has begun. On the more than 100-meter-wide Hanshui River, crane ships, iron barges, tugboats, and other machinery are densely packed, resembling a floating machinery factory, leaving only a narrow channel in the center of the river for passage. Towering "Derrick" cranes are continuously delivering concrete pipe piles and various construction materials from the shore to the river. Pile driving workers who were originally on the shore have now concentrated in the water-based work zone. Hundreds of skilled workers from the bridge engineering team that built the Xiangjiang Bridge and the bridge engineering team that repaired the Qiantang River Bridge have also come from afar to provide support. The director of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau and Soviet bridge experts appear on the construction site almost every day, guiding the underwater pile driving work.

Despite the continuous rain and snow, the work on the construction site, whether it is high-altitude operations more than 30 meters above the ground, diving operations 6 meters deep, or heavy pile driving and hoisting work, has not been interrupted for a moment. Workers have cleared the mud on the roads and installed anti-skid and heating equipment. At the No. 4 and No. 5 piers, workers are using the water jet caisson method to drive many 24-meter-long pipe piles into the riverbed every day. The efficiency of underwater pile driving is constantly improving. Initially, only 16 meters could be driven in eight hours per shift, but now the highest has reached 64 meters.

[Additional News] The bridge spans for the Hanshui Iron Bridge have been manufactured at the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, and will be transported to the bridge construction site in Hankou one after another starting at the end of January for erection.

The bridge spans for the Hanshui Iron Bridge are designed according to Soviet standards. All types of rods and pieces in this type of bridge are standardized, making it suitable for mechanized manufacturing. Furthermore, identical rods and pieces can be interchanged for use on the same bridge or other bridges of the same type. If any one of the rods or pieces is damaged, identical rods and pieces from other bridges can be used in a timely manner to replace them. Even if reassembly is required, the time can be shortened.

The load-bearing capacity of the Hanshui Iron Bridge has been determined by considering the needs of the country's economic construction development. It can not only bear the current load required on the Hanshui Iron Bridge, but also be competent in the future when economic construction develops and the load increases. The manufacture of this bridge began in mid-August of last year and was completed entirely according to the standard design requirements on December 30th of last year.

### 汉水铁桥的水下基础工程正在紧张进行  桥梁已在山海关桥梁工厂制成即将运往架设

　　汉水铁桥的水下基础工程正在紧张进行
　　桥梁已在山海关桥梁工厂制成即将运往架设
    【新华社武汉二十七日电】大雪下白了汉水两岸，建筑汉水铁桥的工人们正冒着严寒抢筑桥梁的水下基础工程，以便在三月洪水期到来以前，把桥墩筑出水面。
    汉水铁桥开工近两个月来，桥头土方工程、陆上的桥台和第一号桥墩基础的打桩工程，已经按计划提前完成。工人们正在堆砂积石，浇灌桥台的混凝土。和这同时，担负着河中央四号、五号桥墩和河两边三号、六号桥墩建筑任务的水上工区已经建立起来，水上工程开始了。在一百多公尺宽的汉水河面上，起重船、铁驳船、拖轮和其他机具密集得如同一个水上机械工厂，只留下河心一条狭仄的航道通行。高耸的“德立克”把杆把混凝土管桩和各种施工器材源源地从岸边送到河上。原来在岸上的打桩工人，现在已集中到水上工区。原来建设湘江大桥的桥梁工程队和修理钱塘江大桥的桥梁工程队的数百个熟练工人，也都远道赶来支援。武汉长江大桥工程局局长和苏联桥梁专家几乎每天都出现在工地上，指导着水下打桩工程。
    尽管雨雪在纷纷扬扬，但工地上无论是三十多公尺高的高空作业，六公尺深的潜水作业，以及繁重的打桩、起重等工作都没有一刻间断过。工人们清除了道路上的泥泞，装上了防滑和取暖设备。在四号和五号桥墩处，每天都有许多根长二十四公尺的管桩，由工人们用射水沉箱的方法送进河底。水下打桩的效率正在不断提高。开始时每班八小时只能打十六公尺，现在最高的已打到六十四公尺。
    【又讯】汉水铁桥的桥梁，已在中央人民政府铁道部山海关桥梁工厂制成，一月底起将陆续运往汉口桥头工地架设。
    汉水铁桥的桥梁是按照苏联的标准设计作的。这种桥梁的各类杆件都是标准化的，所以适合于机械化制造，而且各相同杆件可以在同一个桥梁或型式相同的其他桥梁上互换使用，如果其中的任何一个杆件受到损坏，其他桥梁上的相同杆件就可以及时地用来补配上去，即使需要重新装配，在时间上也可以缩短。
    汉水铁桥桥梁的承载能力，是考虑了国家经济建设发展的需要来决定的。它不仅能担负目前汉水铁桥上需要的载重量，而且将来经济建设发展，载重量增加了，仍可胜任。这个桥梁从去年八月中旬开始制造，在去年十二月三十日全部按照标准设计的要求制造成功。
