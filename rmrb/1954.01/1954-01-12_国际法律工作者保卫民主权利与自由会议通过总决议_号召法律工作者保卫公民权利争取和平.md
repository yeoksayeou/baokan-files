Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, January 11th: The International Legal Workers' Conference for the Defense of Democratic Rights and Freedoms continued its sessions on the 6th and 7th, and closed on the 7th.

	At the meeting on the 6th, Chilean representative G. Alvarez stated that the American laws suppressing democratic freedoms had been adopted in Chile. The Chilean constitution had become a scrap of paper because it did not guarantee the rights and freedoms it proclaimed. Domestic democratic organizations and progressive figures in Chile were being persecuted. She requested that the conference protest against foreign interference in the internal affairs of other countries, especially the internal affairs of the Chilean people.

	Argentine representative Marcos Armando Ghatti protested against American interference in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. He pointed out that things had even reached the point where the American Congress was reviewing and rejecting the new constitution of Puerto Rico.

	Canadian representative Paul Normandin said that under the influence of the United States, "anti-communist" hysteria was rampant in Canada. Government authorities were using Nazi methods, such as burning books. They were using various methods to obstruct the activities of trade union organizations, and citizens had to be told by the police what to read and write.

	Austrian representative Professor Brandweiner said that although the Austrian constitution declared that all people were equal before the law, this was not the case in practice, and influential people in the two ruling parties enjoyed privileges.

	Algerian representative Kian spoke about the situation of the Algerian people not having rights. He said that there was only one way to get rid of this situation, and that was to achieve national independence for the Algerian people.

	People's Republic of China representative Wang Feiran described the judicial system of People's China. He said that the Chinese courts served the people, defended the freedom of the people, and were supervised by the masses.

	Iranian representative Kandri said that 15,000 Iranian patriots had been thrown into prisons or concentration camps. He called on legal workers around the world to support Iranian patriots. Representatives from Guatemala, Lebanon, Brazil, and Sudan also spoke at the meeting.

	At the closing meeting on the 7th, the President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, Pritt, summarized the four-day meeting. He pointed out that the representatives' speeches illustrated the overall situation of the increasing reduction and restriction of citizens' freedoms in capitalist countries. The ruling groups of these countries, fearing the people, were practicing fascism and attempting to suppress all civil liberties. The situation in the colonies was particularly serious, with political and economic inequality and racial discrimination. In some countries, people engaged in peace propaganda were being brutally persecuted. Pritt said that in view of this situation, we should draw the conclusion that the struggle for civil liberties and the struggle for peace, and the struggle against all those who oppose progress, are indivisible. Therefore, legal workers in all countries should fight with all their might to defend democratic freedoms in their own countries, for peace, and against all colonial systems. Legal workers in colonial countries should fight against all colonial systems. Legal workers should support the struggle for civil liberties in other countries. The proposals put forward at the meeting for legal workers from various countries to conduct mutual visits and meetings must be implemented on a broad scale. Pritt finally called on legal workers from all countries to fight selflessly for peace, progress, and humanity, and for the establishment of a world in which everyone can receive the respect they deserve.

	The meeting finally passed a general resolution. The general resolution called on legal workers in all countries to rise up to defend constitutional rights and civil rights, defend trade union rights, promote the easing of international tensions through consultation, and fight for peace and democratic freedoms.

    国际法律工作者保卫民主权利与自由会议通过总决议
    号召法律工作者保卫公民权利争取和平
   【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：国际法律工作者保卫民主权利与自由会议六日、七日继续举行会议，并于七日闭幕。
    在六日的会议上，智利代表格·阿尔瓦雷斯发言说，压制民主自由的美国法律在智利被采用了。智利的宪法已成为一张废纸，因为宪法并不能保证它所标榜的权利和自由。智利国内的民主组织和进步人士都受到迫害。她要求会议抗议外国干涉其他国家的内政，特别是智利人民的内政。
    阿根廷代表马科斯·阿曼多·哈蒂抗议美国干涉拉丁美洲国家的内政。他指出，事情甚至到了这种地步，美国国会竟审查波多黎各的新宪法并加以否决。
    加拿大代表保罗·诺曼丁说，在美国的影响下，“反共”歇斯底里在加拿大甚为猖獗。政府当局使用了纳粹的办法，如焚烧书籍等。他们用各种办法来阻挠工会组织的活动，而公民们读什么写什么要由警察机关来吩咐。
    奥地利代表布兰德魏纳教授说，虽然奥地利宪法宣布一切人在法律面前平等，但是，实际上并不是这样，两个执政党的有势力的人士都享有特权。
    阿尔及利亚代表基安谈到了阿尔及利亚人民没有权利的情况。他说，摆脱这种情况的办法只有一个，就是取得阿尔及利亚人民的民族独立。
    中华人民共和国代表王斐然叙述了人民中国的司法制度。他说，中国的法院为人民服务，保卫人民的自由，并受群众的监督。
    伊朗代表坎德里说，一万五千名伊朗爱国者已被投入监狱或集中营。他要求全世界法律工作者支援伊朗的爱国者。在会上发言的还有危地马拉、黎巴嫩、巴西和苏丹的代表。
    在七日的闭幕会议上，国际民主法律工作者协会主席普里特对四天的会议作了总结。他指出，代表们的发言说明了资本主义国家中公民的自由日益减少并受到限制的整个情况。这些国家的统治集团由于害怕人民而实行法西斯主义，企图压制一切公民自由。殖民地的情况特别严重，那里存在着政治上、经济上的不平等和种族歧视。在一些国家中，从事和平宣传的人受到残酷的迫害。普里特说，鉴于这种情况，我们应该得出结论：争取公民自由的斗争和争取和平的斗争，和对一切反对进步的人所作的斗争，是不可分割的。因此，各国的法律工作者应以全力为保卫本国的民主自由、为和平、为反对一切殖民制度而斗争。殖民地国家的法律工作者应对一切殖民制度作斗争。法律工作者应该支持其他国家中争取公民自由的斗争。会议上所提出的各国法律工作者进行互相访问和会晤的建议必须在广泛的规模上实现。普里特最后号召各国法律工作者要奋不顾身地为和平、进步和人道，为建立一个每个人都能得到应有的尊重的世界而斗争。
    会议最后通过了总决议。总决议号召各国法律工作者起来保卫宪法权利和公民权利，保卫工会权利，促进以协商方式来缓和国际紧张局势，为和平与民主自由而斗争。
