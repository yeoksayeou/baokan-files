In the first year of implementing the national First Five-Year Plan, the vast number of rural cadres and farmers in the Southwest region made tremendous efforts on the agricultural production front, overcame various natural disasters, ensured increased production of grain and cash crops, and strongly supported national economic construction. According to statistics, grain production in the entire region in 1953 increased by 7.8% compared to 1952. In terms of cash crops: the unit area yield of cotton increased by 0.63% compared to 1952; in the sugarcane production areas of Zizhong and Neijiang, the total output increased by 40% compared to 1952; the largest flue-cured tobacco production area in the Southwest, Guizhou Province, increased flue-cured tobacco production by 59% compared to 1952; and tea production increased by 8.64%. Mountainous and ethnic minority areas also achieved bumper harvests. Mountainous areas in Yunnan Province increased production by 40% to 150% compared to 1952. The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province also successfully completed its plan to increase grain production by 4,600 tons.

The reason why various crops in the entire region achieved bumper harvests is inseparable from the strong leadership of Party committees and people's governments at all levels in strengthening agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation. Since the spring plowing in 1953, Party and government leading organs at all levels have resolutely implemented the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, regarding agricultural production as "the central task that overrides everything else in the countryside at present," opposing bureaucracy, subjectivism, and decentralism, and basically eliminating the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural areas. In Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and other places, many leading cadres of the prefectural and county Party committees personally went to the countryside to summarize the production experience of the masses and guide agricultural production during spring plowing, beginning to change the generalized leadership style of the past.

Overcoming various natural disasters and promoting advanced experience are also important reasons for achieving a bumper harvest in 1953. From the spring plowing and sowing to the harvest season, varying degrees of drought, pests, floods, hail, and other natural disasters occurred in various places. Under the leadership of the Party and the people's government, the vast number of farmers waged a tenacious struggle against these disasters. For example, in Renhuai, Chishui, Jinsha, and other more than 20 counties in Guizhou Province, farmers universally launched "anti-disaster rush harvesting" campaigns during the autumn harvest, making every effort to increase the harvest of crops. In Yunnan Province, between July and August, the province mobilized more than 100,000 cadres from the Party, government, and military systems to go to the countryside to lead farmers in fighting drought and controlling pests. They worked in the fields with the farmers, encouraging the farmers' confidence in fighting disasters. Farmers in 14 counties in the Dujiangyan irrigation area in Sichuan Province acted in an organized manner to overcome floods, ensuring that 30,000 mu of farmland were spared from floods and achieved a bumper harvest. In order to gradually promote advanced agricultural technologies, Sichuan Province specifically convened a provincial meeting of agricultural labor models in the spring of 1953, summarizing advanced experiences such as "good seeds and strong seedlings, fewer seedlings and dense planting, and rational fertilization." Generally, various places combined various agricultural seasons and, based on local conditions and mass experience, gradually promoted these experiences through convening meetings of elderly farmers, typical demonstrations, and other methods. Some areas in Guizhou and Xikang also promoted experiences such as the "single-plant close planting" of selected seeds and corn according to local conditions, further convincing the vast number of farmers of the benefits of advanced farming experience.

Under the unified leadership of the local Party committees and people's governments, local banks, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other departments actively served agricultural production, and also played a major role in increasing production in 1953. By the end of September, a total of 986.7 billion yuan in agricultural loans had been issued in the entire region. These loans played a considerable role in helping farmers produce. The total value of production materials supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives in 1953 increased by 149% compared to 1952. The supply of oil cake alone by the end of November was equivalent to 242.82% of the total supply in 1952, greatly solving the difficulties of farmers in terms of production materials.

    西南区各种农作物去年普遍增产
    在执行国家第一个五年计划的第一个年度计划中，西南区广大农村工作干部和农民群众在农业生产战线上作了极大的努力，战胜了各种自然灾害，保证了粮食以及经济作物的增产，有力地支援了国家经济建设。据统计，一九五三年全区粮食生产较一九五二年增产百分之七点八；在经济作物方面：棉花比一九五二年单位面积产量提高百分之零点六三，甘蔗产地资中、内江一带，比一九五二年总产量增加百分之四十，西南最大的烤烟产区——贵州省烤烟比一九五二年增产百分之五十九，茶叶增产百分之八点六四。山区和少数民族地区，也都获得了丰收。云南省山区较一九五二年增产百分之四十至百分之一百五十。西康省藏族自治区也胜利完成增产粮食四千六百吨的计划。
    全区各种农作物所以获得丰收，是与各级党委和人民政府大力加强了对农业生产和互助合作的领导分不开的。一九五三年春耕以来，各级党、政领导机关坚决贯彻了中共中央的指示，把农业生产当成“当前农村中压倒一切的中心工作”，反对了官僚主义、主观主义和分散主义，基本上消除了农村
  “五多”现象。四川、云南、贵州等地，不少中共地委、县委的领导干部，在春耕生产中，亲自下乡总结群众中的生产经验，指导农业生产，开始改变了过去一般化的领导作风。
    战胜各种自然灾害和推广先进经验，也是一九五三年获得丰收的重要原因之一。从春耕播种到收获季节，各地先后不同程度地发生了旱、虫、涝、冰雹等各种自然灾害，广大农民在党和人民政府的领导下，和这些灾害作了坚强的斗争。如贵州省仁怀、赤水、金沙等二十余县的农民，在秋收中普遍展开“抗灾抢收”运动，尽最后一切努力提高农作物的收获量。云南省在七八两月之间，全省抽调党政军系统干部十万多人，下乡领导农民抗旱和治虫，他们在田间和农民一道工作，鼓舞了农民和灾害作斗争的信心。四川省都江堰流域十四个县的农民，有组织地行动起来战胜了洪水，保证了三万亩田免受水灾，得到丰收。为了逐步地推广先进的农业技术，一九五三年春天，四川省曾专门召开全省农业劳动模范会议，总结了“好种壮秧、少秧密栽、合理施肥”等先进经验，各地一般都结合各项农事季节，根据当地的条件和群众经验，通过召开老年农民会、典型示范等方式，逐步地推广了这些经验。贵州、西康部分地区，也根据当地情况推广了选种、玉米的“单株密植”等经验，使广大农民更进一步相信了先进耕作经验的好处。
    各地银行、供销合作社等部门，在当地党委和人民政府的统一领导下，积极为农业生产服务，在一九五三年增产中也起了重大作用。到九月底止，全区共发放农贷九千八百六十七亿元。这些贷款对帮助农民生产起了相当大的作用。供销合作社一九五三年供应生产资料的总值比一九五二年增加百分之一百四十九，仅油饼一项的供应量到十一月底为止，即相当于一九五二年全年供应量的百分之二百四十二点八二，大大地解决了农民生产资料的困难。
