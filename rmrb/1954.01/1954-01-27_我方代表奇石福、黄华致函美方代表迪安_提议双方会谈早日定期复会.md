Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 26th: Mr. Qi Shi-fu, representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Mr. Huang Hua, representative of the People's Republic of China, participating in the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, requested their liaison secretary at the meeting of liaison secretaries on January 26th to forward a letter to Mr. Dean, the U.S. representative. The full text is as follows:
    Mr. Dean:
    In order to satisfy the ardent desire of the people of Korea and China and the peace-loving people and countries of the world to peacefully resolve the Korean issue in order to ease the tense situations in the Far East and the world, the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued statements on January 9th and 10th, 1954 respectively, advocating the immediate resumption of bilateral talks on the political conference issue in order to quickly arrange the convening of the political conference. Subsequently, we sent you a letter on January 11th, requesting an immediate meeting of the liaison secretaries of both sides to agree on the date for the resumption of bilateral talks. It was on the basis of this proposal from the Chinese and Korean sides that the meeting of liaison secretaries of both sides began on January 14th.
    However, due to your side's continued adoption of delaying tactics to obstruct the convening of the political conference, the meeting of liaison secretaries since January 14th has made no progress to this day. In order to enable the bilateral talks to resume immediately, our side has proposed resumption dates three times, but your side has consistently refused. In order to prevent the immediate resumption of bilateral talks, your side has consistently and unreasonably insisted on holding administrative meetings of the liaison secretaries of both sides to revise the meeting records, instead of agreeing on a resumption date. In this way, your side has already obstructed the convening of the political conference in the bilateral talks, and now it is obstructing the resumption of bilateral talks in the meeting of liaison secretaries. Your actions have brought the meeting of secretaries of both sides to a virtual standstill, making the convening of the political conference more and more distant, and causing the world's people's desire for peace to suffer increasingly serious blows.
    While carrying out these delaying and obstructing activities, your side has also deliberately spread an atmosphere of optimism in propaganda, attempting to create illusions among the people of the world, believing that the meeting of liaison secretaries of both sides still has hope of making progress. In view of this, in order to clarify this issue and in order to enable the early resumption of bilateral talks on the political conference issue to promote the convening of the political conference, we believe that it is necessary to directly raise the issue with you to seek a solution.
    Based on the above position, we now propose that the bilateral talks on the political conference be resumed at Panmunjom on February 1, 1954. If your side is still sincere about resuming this conference, your side has no reason to reject this proposal from our side. If your side is willing to propose your side's date for the resumption of bilateral talks, our side is willing to give it serious consideration.
    We await your reply.

      Qi Shi-fu, Representative of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
      Huang Hua, Representative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
                        January 26, 1954

　　我方代表奇石福、黄华致函美方代表迪安
　　提议双方会谈早日定期复会
   【新华社开城二十六日电】参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生与中华人民共和国代表黄华先生，经由其联络秘书在一月二十六日的双方联络秘书会议上，请美方联络秘书送交美方代表迪安先生一函。全文如下：迪安先生：
    为了满足朝中人民及全世界爱好和平的人民和国家要求和平解决朝鲜问题以利于缓和远东和世界紧张局势的殷切愿望，中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾于一九五四年一月九日、十日先后发表声明，主张立即恢复关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，来迅速安排政治会议的召开。接着，我们在一月十一日给你去信，要求由双方联络秘书立即进行会晤，以商定恢复双方会谈的日期。就在朝中方面这一建议的基础之上，双方联络秘书会议才于一月十四日开始举行。
    但是，由于你方继续采取拖延态度来阻挠政治会议召开的政策，自一月十四日以来的联络秘书会议至今迄无任何进展。我方为了使双方会谈立即恢复，曾经三次提出复会日期，但你方始终加以拒绝。你方为了使双方会谈不能立即恢复，始终无理地主张举行双方联络秘书的行政性会议来修改会谈记录，而不愿商定复会日期。这样，你方既已在双方会谈中阻挠了政治会议的召开，现在又在联络秘书会议中阻挠着双方会谈的恢复。你方的这种行动已使双方秘书会议实质上陷于停顿，使政治会议的召开愈离愈远，使世界人民的和平愿望遭受着日益加重的打击。
    你方在进行这种拖延和阻挠活动的同时，还故意在宣传上散布乐观的空气，企图在世界人民中间造成幻想，以为双方联络秘书会议仍有取得进展的希望。有鉴于此，为了澄清这一问题，并为了使关于政治会议的问题的双方会谈得以早日恢复来推动政治会议的召开，我们认为必须将问题直接向你提出来寻求解决。
    根据上述立场，我们现在提议关于政治会议的双方会谈定于一九五四年二月一日在板门店复会。如果你方对于恢复这一会议尚有诚意，你方就没有任何理由来拒绝我方的这一提议。如果你方愿意提出你方关于恢复双方会谈的日期，我方愿予以慎重的考虑。
    我们等待你的回答。
      朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表奇石福
      中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表黄　华
                        一九五四年一月二十六日
