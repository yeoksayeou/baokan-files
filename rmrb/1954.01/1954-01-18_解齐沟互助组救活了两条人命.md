    Jieqigou Mutual Aid Team Saves Two Lives
    Du Geng and Jiang Hao of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Xinhailian City Committee, Jiangsu Province, write: In early November of last year, Zhang Shuzhuang, a member of the Jieqigou Mutual Aid Team in Sucheng Township, Xinhailian City, had a wife who gave birth to a chubby baby boy. However, the placenta had not come out a full day and night after the child's birth, and both mother and child were in danger. The comrades at the district health clinic could not do anything about it and had to tell Zhang Shuzhuang to quickly take the mother to the Haizhou Municipal Hospital for treatment. This made things difficult for Zhang Shuzhuang. There was no grain at home, no money in hand, and Haizhou was more than 50 li away. What could he do alone? He thought that his uncles, and separated younger brother had grain and money, so he ran to them to borrow some. Who knew that as soon as they knew his intention, they all started crying poverty. Zhang Shuzhuang ran into several snags and returned home empty-handed. In the end, he helplessly decided to ask the cadres for help to find a solution.

    As soon as the village director, Xu Zhide, heard Zhang Shuzhuang explain his intentions, he immediately summoned the mutual aid team members to explain the situation and ask everyone to come up with a solution. Everyone decided to take out 500,000 yuan, which was the money they had earned from quarrying stones in the team, to help with the emergency, and that very night they helped carry the patient to the hospital. After treatment by the doctor, the mother finally escaped danger a day later.

    "How can I repay the team the money I owe? How can I repay this kindness?" Zhang Shuzhuang kept thinking all night. The next day, he decided to sell his land and his only pig. At this time, Zhang Shuzhuang's uncles hurriedly asked someone to mediate, telling Zhang Shuzhuang to sell his family property to "his own people" and not let it fall into the hands of "outsiders". When the mutual aid team members learned about this situation, they hurriedly discussed it with the village director. Everyone decided to let Zhang Shuzhuang repay the money slowly in the future, so as not to sell the land and affect future production and life.

    Zhang Shuzhuang's worries were resolved. He kept thinking in his heart: Why are these people who are not related to me treating me better than my "own flesh and blood"? He finally figured it out: This is because Chairman Mao is leading everyone to organize collective labor and cultivate everyone's spirit of collectivism and mutual assistance. He is determined to work hard with everyone to improve production and gradually upgrade the mutual aid team into an agricultural producers' cooperative.

    解齐沟互助组救活了两条人命
    中共江苏省新海连市委宣传部杜庚、姜浩来信：去年十一月上旬，新海连市宿城乡解齐沟互助组组员张树庄的妻子生了个白胖胖的娃娃，但是，孩子出生后一天一夜胎衣还没有下来，眼看着大人小孩都有生命危险。区卫生所的同志也没有办法，只好叫张树庄把产妇赶快抬到海州市立医院去救治。这一下张树庄可为了难。家里没有粮，手里没有钱，到海州五十多里，单人独户怎么办？他想到他伯伯、叔叔和分居的胞弟家中有粮有钱，就三步并作两步跑去商借。谁知他们一知来意就都哭起穷来，张树庄碰了几个钉子，还是两手空空跑回家来。最后，他无可奈何地决定找干部帮忙想办法。
    村主任徐志德一听张树庄说明来意后就马上召集互助组员说明原因，要大家想办法。大家决定把大伙在组里打石头挣来的钱拿出五十万元来救急，并且当天夜里就帮着把病人抬到医院。经过医生救治，一天后，产妇终于脱离了险境。
    “欠组里的钱如何偿还呢？这些人情怎么报答呢？”张树庄整夜老是想着。第二天，他决定出卖自己的地和仅有的一口猪。这时，张树庄的叔叔、伯伯急着托人来说合，叫张树庄把家产卖给“自己人”，不要落到“外人”手里去。互助组组员们知道了这个情况，急忙和村主任商量。大家决定让张树庄以后慢慢还钱，免得把地卖了，影响今后的生产和生活。
    张树庄的心事解决了。他心里老是想：为什么这些非亲非故的人对我比“亲骨肉”还好呢？他终于想通了：这是因为毛主席领导大家组织起来集体劳动，培养了大家互助互济的集体主义精神。他决心要和大家一齐努力，搞好生产，并且把互助组逐步提高成农业生产合作社。
