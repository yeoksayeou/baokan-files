    North Korea’s “Rodong Sinmun” and “Minju Choson” both published editorials on the 9th, demanding that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission immediately resume the explanation work and make up for the ninety-day explanation period for prisoners of war.

    The “Rodong Sinmun” editorial pointed out: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in its recent "Interim Report" to both sides of the Korean Armistice Agreement and in the letter from the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, General Thimayya, has confirmed the fact that the United Nations Command side has sabotaged the explanation work, and argued that it is necessary to extend the explanation period. This proposition is in line with the "Terms of Reference." To this, Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, have once again clarified the firm position of the Korean and Chinese sides in their reply letter to General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This letter has now received warm support from the people of Korea and China and all peace-loving people around the world.

    The editorial pointed out: The US side must bear the responsibility for preventing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from earnestly implementing the "Terms of Reference." The fact that the US side has sabotaged the explanation work cannot be concealed at all. However, UN Commander Hull, in his letter to General Thimayya on January 3, still denied this conclusive fact, attempting to shift the responsibility to the Korean and Chinese sides; at the same time, the US-Syngman Rhee gang is clamoring to forcibly detain more than 20,000 of our captured personnel on January 23. This is absolutely unacceptable to all peace-loving people around the world. The editorial concluded by emphasizing that all peace-loving people denounce the US side's sinister plot to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and use them as cannon fodder, and resolutely demand that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission immediately resume the explanation work and make up for the ninety-day explanation period.

    The “Minju Choson” editorial pointed out: The US imperialists are not only sabotaging the explanation work and interrupting the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, but are also attempting to abduct more than 20,000 of our captured personnel. The legitimate demands put forward by Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai in their reply letter to General Thimayya at this time are of great significance to the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    The editorial emphasized: Only by taking appropriate measures in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" can the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission maintain the impartial position of neutral countries, thereby receiving the sincere support of just people all over the world. The Korean people demand that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission maintain a fair and neutral attitude, ensure that the ninety-day explanation period for prisoners of war is made up, and earnestly perform their legitimate duties that have not yet been completed.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”和“民主朝鲜报”分别发表社论
    要求中立国遣返委员会立即恢复解释工作
    【新华社平壤九日电】朝鲜“劳动新闻”、“民主朝鲜报”都在九日发表社论，要求中立国遣返委员会立即恢复解释工作，补足对战俘的九十天解释期限。
    “劳动新闻”的社论指出：中立国遣返委员会最近在给朝鲜停战缔约双方的“临时报告”和中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅的来信中已确证了联合国军方面破坏解释工作的事实，并主张有必要延长解释日期。这个主张是符合于“职权范围”的主张。对此，朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在给中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军的复信中已再一次地阐明了朝中方面的坚定立场。这封信现已获得朝中人民和全世界善良人民的热烈支持。
    社论指出：美方必须担负不让中立国遣返委员会认真执行“职权范围”的责任。美方破坏解释工作的事实是绝对无法掩盖的。然而，联合国军总司令赫尔在他一月三日写给蒂迈雅将军的信中却仍然抵赖这个确凿的事实，企图把责任转嫁到朝中方面；同时，美李匪帮在叫嚣着要在一月二十三日强迫扣留两万多名我方被俘人员。这是全世界爱好和平人民所绝不能容许的。社论最后强调说：所有爱好和平的人民都痛斥美方企图强迫扣留朝中被俘人员而把他们充当炮灰的罪恶阴谋，并坚决要求中立国遣返委员会立即恢复解释工作，补足九十天的解释期限。
    “民主朝鲜报”社论指出：美帝国主义者不仅破坏解释工作，中断关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，而且正在企图劫持两万多名我方被俘人员。金日成元帅和彭德怀将军在这个时候写给蒂迈雅将军的复信中提出了正当的要求，这对于中立国遣返委员会的工作是具有重大意义的。
    社论强调指出：中立国遣返委员会只有按照“职权范围”采取正当措施，才能保持中立国的公正立场，从而受到全世界正义人类的衷心支持。朝鲜人民要求中立国遣返委员会保持公正的中立态度，保证补足对战俘的九十天解释期限，认真执行他们还没有完成的合法职务。
