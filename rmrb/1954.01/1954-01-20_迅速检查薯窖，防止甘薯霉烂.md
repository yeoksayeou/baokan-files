    Quickly Inspect Sweet Potato Cellars to Prevent Sweet Potato Rot
    Relief Division, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Central People's Government
    According to recent reports from various regions, the phenomenon of sweet potato rot is widespread and quite serious in many areas. In the Shaoyang Special District and Shimen, Liuyang, and other counties of Hunan Province, some villages have already seen 50% to 80% of their sweet potatoes rot. In Chenji Village, Erqu District, Gushu County, Henan Province, 35 farming households harvested over 100,000 jin of sweet potatoes, almost all of which have rotted. Sweet potato rot is also widespread in Fugou, Yancheng, Baofeng, and other eight counties in the Xuchang Special District. In Taertou Village, Yuanzhuang Township, Yenaan County, Shandong Province, one-third of the village's sweet potatoes have completely rotted, and another third have partially rotted. Sweet potatoes in Changli County, Hebei Province, have also begun to rot.
    The reasons for sweet potato rot include: some were due to excessive rain after autumn, resulting in too much moisture in the sweet potatoes after they were dug up and before they were stored in cellars, or they were exposed to frost; some were due to damage to the sweet potatoes during harvesting and transportation, leading to rot; some were due to residual pathogens left in cellars that had previously contained rotten sweet potatoes, which infected the newly harvested sweet potatoes; and some were due to sweet potatoes being infected with diseases while still growing.
    Sweet potatoes are a staple food for farmers in many parts of China during the winter and spring seasons. If large quantities rot, it will cause serious difficulties in people's lives. In the winter of 1952, some areas of Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces were hit by cold waves, freezing and destroying 2.3 billion jin of sweet potatoes, exacerbating the spring famine of the following year. Therefore, serious attention must be paid to the phenomenon of sweet potato rot. Local authorities should immediately mobilize the masses to conduct a cellar inspection and promptly find ways to salvage any rotten sweet potatoes by drying them to reduce losses. At the same time, the masses should be educated to regularly inspect cellars and strengthen cellar management. Some areas have already paid attention to this issue, such as Linru County in Henan Province, which instructed all districts to carefully check the situation of sweet potato rot; Fugou County's Erqu District has mobilized the masses to salvage 5 million jin of sweet potatoes. Dongkou County in Hunan Province convened a symposium of township cadres (mostly veteran farmers) from three townships to identify sweet potato storage experiences. The practices of these regions are very good and worth learning from.
    According to local experiences, preventing sweet potato rot primarily requires good management of sweet potato cellars. First, when storing sweet potatoes, they should be carefully selected, and any with black spots or injuries should be picked out, with only the intact sweet potatoes stored in the cellar. Second, cellars that have previously contained rotten sweet potatoes should have a layer of soil scraped off the walls and bottom (especially the bottom) to remove any residual pathogens. Third, if the sweet potato cellar is too shallow, it should be dug deeper and renovated. Fourth, when entering the cellar to retrieve sweet potatoes in winter, choose a sunny and windless day. Whenever there is such weather, the air vents of the cellar should be opened to allow ventilation. If the weather is too cold, wheat straw, rice straw, wheat bran, or grain bran can be used to cover the sweet potatoes and seal the cellar opening to prevent them from freezing. Fifth, after the Beginning of Spring (立春), the cellar opening and air vents should be tightly sealed to prevent spring winds from entering, which can cause rot. Sixth, pick out the sweet potatoes that have begun to rot, remove the bad parts, and cut the good parts into sweet potato slices, shreds, or grains to be dried; if there is no sun or the weather is cold, they can be thinly spread in a pot and dried over a fire, or steamed first and then dried over a fire. Dried sweet potatoes should be placed in a dry, ventilated place for long-term storage, and when they are not yet completely dry, they should be covered with grass to prevent them from freezing.

    迅速检查薯窖，防止甘薯霉烂
    中央人民政府内务部救济司
    据最近各地反映，甘薯霉烂现象在许多地区普遍发生，并且很严重。湖南省邵阳专区和石门、浏阳等县有的乡甘薯已霉烂百分之五十至百分之八十。河南省谷熟县二区陈集村，三十五户农民收甘薯十万余斤，几乎全部烂掉。许昌专区扶沟、郾城、宝丰等八县也普遍发生甘薯霉烂现象。山东省掖南县院庄乡塔耳头村全村甘薯有三分之一全部霉烂，另有三分之一霉烂了一部分。河北省昌黎县甘薯也已开始霉烂。
    甘薯霉烂的原因，有的是由于秋后多雨，甘薯出土后未入窖前，水气太多，或受了冻；有的是在收获、搬运中薯块受到损伤，引起腐烂；有的是窖内曾腐烂过甘薯，遗留下的病菌，传染了新收的甘薯；有的则是甘薯还在生长期中便已感染了病害。
    甘薯是我国不少地区农民冬、春两季的主要口粮，如果大批烂掉，就会造成群众生活上的严重困难。一九五二年冬，安徽、江苏、河南、山东等省部分地区遭受寒流袭击，冻毁薯类二十三亿斤，加重了次年的春荒。因此，对于甘薯霉烂现象必须给予严重注意。各地应该立即发动群众进行一次薯窖检查，发现有腐烂现象则须迅速设法抢救，晒干保存，以减少损失。同时，并应教育群众经常检查薯窖，加强薯窖的管理工作。目前有的地区已重视了这一问题，如河南省临汝县曾指示各区认真检查甘薯霉烂情况；扶沟县一区已发动群众抢救出甘薯五百万斤。湖南省洞口县曾召集了三个乡的乡干部（多是老农）座谈，找出了收藏甘薯的经验。这些地区的做法都很好，值得各地学习。
    根据各地经验，防止甘薯霉烂，主要应做好薯窖的管理工作。一、在甘薯入窖时，应经过仔细挑选，把有黑斑或受伤的薯块拣出，将完好的薯块收藏窖内。二、过去曾腐烂过甘薯的窖，要将窖壁和窖底的泥土刮去一层（特别是窖底），以免有病菌留下。三、如果薯窖太浅，应加工挖深修整。四、冬季入窖取甘薯，应选择晴朗无风天气。每逢这种天气，应将薯窖的气孔揭开，使其通风。若天气太冷，可将麦秸、稻草、麦糠、谷糠覆盖甘薯上，堵好窖口，免其受冻。五、立春后，应将窖口、气孔严密封闭，不让春风吹入，以免引起腐烂。六、把开始腐烂的甘薯拣出，将坏的部分去掉，好的部分切成薯片、薯丝、薯米晒干保存；如无太阳或天气寒冷，则可薄摊在锅内，下面加火烤干，或先蒸熟再用火烤干。甘薯干应放置干燥通风处，以便长期保存，在尚不很干时，要用草盖上，以免冻坏。
