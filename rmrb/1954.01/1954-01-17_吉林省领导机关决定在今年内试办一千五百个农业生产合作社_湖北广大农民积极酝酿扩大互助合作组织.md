Xinhua News Agency report: The leading organs of Jilin Province have decided to continue piloting 1,500 agricultural production cooperatives in various districts this year, on the basis of consolidating and improving the existing 1,158 agricultural production cooperatives.
　　The mutual aid and cooperation movement in Jilin Province has greatly developed in the past few years. By the autumn harvest of last year, the organized farming households had reached 85 percent of the total number of farming households in the province, and 22,575 households participated in agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for nearly 2.1 percent of the total number of farming households in the province.
　　Last year, the vast majority of the agricultural production cooperatives piloted throughout the province achieved more income than mutual aid teams and individual farmers. According to a survey by the Jilin Provincial People's Government, the crop yields of the 142 agricultural production cooperatives piloted last year in Yongji County, Jiaohe County, Guoqian Banner, and Yanji City generally exceeded the grain output of local individual farmers, averaging 19.63 percent higher than the output of ordinary mutual aid teams.
　　Throughout the province, in the in-depth publicity of the general line, in addition to mobilizing various propaganda forces to vigorously publicize these moving events, more than 680 agricultural labor models and well-known agricultural production cooperative directors and production team leaders were organized to make reports in various villages. These publicity activities, which were closely linked to reality, greatly educated and encouraged the vast majority of farmers, and farmers asked to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. According to statistics from 17 counties as of December 25 last year, more than 1,370 perennial mutual aid teams had requested to establish agricultural production cooperatives.
　　Xinhua News Agency report: More than 200 mutual aid teams in Hubei Province are brewing the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives; many individual farmers are also actively requesting to establish or join mutual aid and cooperative organizations. After studying the general line, the members of the twelve mutual aid teams in Zhou Mingshan, Peng Dajian, and other areas of Macheng County recognized the greater superiority of agricultural production cooperatives and actively discussed establishing cooperatives. The Dai Xiuli mutual aid team in Miaozui Township, Hong'an County, has recently been studying the cooperative establishment experience of the Rao Xingli agricultural production cooperative in Xishui County every night, preparing to establish a cooperative. After studying the general line, many mutual aid teams and individual farmers in Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, inquired whether the Rao Xingli agricultural production cooperative in their township was expanding, thinking about joining the agricultural production cooperative. In order to guide farmers to build agricultural production cooperatives well, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China specifically convened a provincial agricultural production cooperative conference in November last year to specifically deploy the work of establishing agricultural production cooperatives. Subsequently, most areas of the province also held training courses for cadres to establish cooperatives on a county basis. At present, 15 counties in Xiaogan Prefecture and 6 counties in Jingzhou Prefecture have completed the training of cadres for establishing cooperatives. Based on the active demands and possible conditions of farmers throughout the province, the leading organs of Hubei Province have decided to increase the number of newly established agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province this year from the original plan of 275 to more than 520.

    吉林省领导机关决定在今年内
    试办一千五百个农业生产合作社
    湖北广大农民积极酝酿扩大互助合作组织
    据新华社讯：吉林省领导机关，决定在巩固和提高现有一千一百五十八个农业生产合作社的基础上，继续由各区在今年内试办一千五百个农业生产合作社。
    吉林省互助合作运动在过去几年中已有很大发展，到去年秋收时为止，组织起来的农户已达全省农户总数的百分之八十五，参加农业生产合作社的有二万二千五百七十五户，将近占全省农户总数的百分之二点一。
    去年全省试办的农业生产合作社，绝大部分都取得了多于互助组和单干农民的收入。据吉林省人民政府调查，永吉县、蛟河县、郭前旗和延吉市去年试办的一百四十二个农业生产合作社农作物的收获量，普遍超过当地单干农民的粮食产量，平均高出一般互助组的产量百分之十九点六三。
    全省在深入宣传总路线中，除动员各种宣传力量大力宣传这些动人的事例外，并组织了六百八十余名农业劳动模范和出名的农业生产合作社的主任、生产队长等到各村屯做报告。这些密切联系实际的宣传活动，使绝大多数农民都受到了极大的教育和鼓舞，农民们纷纷要求参加互助合作组织。据到去年十二月二十五日止十七个县的统计，要求建立农业生产合作社的常年互助组已有一千三百七十多个。
    据新华社讯：湖北全省已有两百多个互助组正酝酿建立农业生产合作社；不少单干农民也积极要求建立或参加互助合作组织。麻城县周明山、彭大简等十二个互助组的组员们在学习总路线后，认清了农业生产合作社的更大优越性，便积极讨论建社。红安县庙咀乡戴修礼互助组，最近天天晚上学习浠水县饶兴礼农业生产合作社的建社经验，准备建社。浠水县望城乡的很多互助组和单干农民，学习了总路线后，打听本乡的饶兴礼农业生产合作社是否扩大，想着参加农业生产合作社。为领导农民建好农业生产合作社，中共湖北省委员会在去年十一月间就专门召开了全省农业生产合作社会议，具体部署了建立农业生产合作社的工作。随后，全省大部地区又以县为单位开办了建社干部训练班。现在，全省已有孝感专区的十五个县和荆州专区的六个县结束了建社干部训练工作。根据全省农民的积极要求和可能条件，湖北省领导机关已决定全省由原计划今年新建二百七十五个农业生产合作社，增加到建立五百二十多个。
