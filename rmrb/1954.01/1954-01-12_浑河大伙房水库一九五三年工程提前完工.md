    The 1953 construction plan for the Hun River Dahuo Fang Reservoir project in Liaodong Province, China's second giant reservoir construction project, has been successfully completed. The water diversion tunnel project, one of the three major projects of the reservoir which commenced on November 1st, had overfulfilled the original plan by about 10% by the end of the year. For the needs of engineering transportation and traffic, the construction of two large wooden bridges across the Hun River and Zhangdang River, dozens of kilometers of power transmission lines and telephone lines inside and outside the construction site, as well as light railways and highways, have been completed. The construction of nearly 30,000 square meters of buildings including employee dormitories, offices, canteens, clinics, workshops, and warehouses has also been successfully completed. The equipment of the air compressor factory, the pneumatic drill factory, the lumber mill, and the woodworking factory has been installed and officially put into production. The machinery repair shop is currently capable of repairing various internal combustion engines, electric motors, and transformers, and can manufacture simple mechanical parts. The mechanical equipment now includes nearly a thousand units of various excavators, dump trucks, sprinkler trucks, bulldozers, scrapers, graders, and mining cars. In addition, in addition to completing the design work for the dam and spillway, efforts were also organized to investigate the flood control capacity of the Hun River downstream. The completion of the above-mentioned projects and construction preparation work has laid a good foundation for the comprehensive construction of the reservoir project in 1954. At present, all employees are full of confidence to welcome the comprehensive commencement of the reservoir project in 1954.

    浑河大伙房水库一九五三年工程提前完工
    我国水利建设中的第二个巨型水库——辽东省浑河大伙房水库工程，已胜利地完成了一九五三年施工计划。十一月一日开工的水库三大工程之一的输水道工程，到年底已超额完成原计划百分之十左右。为了工程运输和交通的需要，跨在浑河和章党河上的两座大木桥，数十公里的输电线及工地内外电话线的架设工程以及轻便铁道和公路都已完工。包括有职工宿舍、办公室、食堂、诊疗所、场房、仓库等近三万平方公尺的房屋建筑工程也都胜利竣工。空气压缩机厂、压钎子厂、制材厂和木工厂的设备都已安装完毕，正式开车生产。机械修理厂目前已能修理各种内燃机、电动机和变压器等，并能制造简单的机械零件。机械设备现已有各种挖土机、自卸汽车、洒水车、推土机、铲运机、平土机等主要机械及矿车近千台。此外，除完成了拦河坝、溢洪道等设计工作外，还组织力量进行了浑河下游河道防洪能力的调查。上述工程及施工准备工作的完成，为一九五四年水库工程的全面施工打下了良好的基础。现在，全体职工正满怀信心迎接一九五四年水库工程全面开工。
