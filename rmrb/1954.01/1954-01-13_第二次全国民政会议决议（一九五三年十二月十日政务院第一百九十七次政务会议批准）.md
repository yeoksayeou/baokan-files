    Resolution of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference
    (Approved by the 197th Executive Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on December 10, 1953)
    The Second National Civil Affairs Conference listened to and discussed Minister Xie Juezai's report on the summary of civil affairs work in the past four years and future tasks, unanimously agreeing with the spirit of the report and making the following resolutions:
    Thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and governments at all levels, and thanks to the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, all civil affairs cadres, and other relevant departments, the civil affairs work has achieved great results in the past four years. In terms of political power construction: People's representative conferences at all local levels across the country were generally convened by the end of 1952. The people's representative conferences of provinces (municipalities) and more than one-third of the counties and two-thirds of the cities have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congresses, and consolidated the grassroots political power in conjunction with various social reform movements. In ethnic minority areas, most of the people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society were convened, and ethnic autonomous regions and ethnic democratic coalition governments at all levels were established. This has played a significant role in uniting the people of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and organizing and promoting various social reforms and production and construction, and has laid a good foundation for convening people's congresses at all levels through universal suffrage. In terms of preferential treatment work: with the development and deepening of the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, a mass movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers was launched, which raised the political status of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, and enhanced the patriotic ideological consciousness of the people. All localities mobilized the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers with labor power to cultivate their land well. For families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers lacking labor power, the masses were mobilized to cultivate the land on their behalf, with approximately more than 50 million mu of land cultivated on their behalf. For families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers with livelihood difficulties, material subsidies were provided, with approximately more than 6 million people receiving material subsidies. All revolutionary disabled soldiers were given pensions, and 67 revolutionary disabled soldier schools and 33 revolutionary disabled soldier sanatoriums were established. Demobilized and transferred soldiers were resettled, enabling them to participate in production and various construction undertakings. These measures have played a significant role in boosting morale, consolidating national defense, and supporting the liberation war and the Resist America and Aid Korea War. In terms of rural disaster relief work: in areas affected by natural disasters, disaster victims were organized to carry out production for self-relief. In the past four years, more than 42.7 trillion yuan of relief funds have been allocated from the central government alone, maintaining the labor force of disaster victims and helping them overcome disasters victoriously. In terms of urban relief work: in cooperation with the China People's Relief General Association and its branches, 360,000 vagrants were reformed and impoverished and helpless disabled, elderly, and orphans were taken care of and educated. Approximately more than 1.2 million impoverished urban residents were relieved each year. More than 420 so-called "charitable" organizations manipulated and controlled by imperialism in the past and used to carry out sabotage activities were taken over and transformed, and the influence of imperialism was eliminated from them. In addition, civil affairs departments at all levels, in coordination with relevant parties, have also carried out a lot of work and achieved considerable results in mobilizing civilian workers, land administration, household registration, implementing the Marriage Law, and other tasks assigned by the local government.
    However, there have also been many shortcomings in the civil affairs work in the past four years. In terms of political power construction: some cadres still lack understanding of the fact that democracy is the source of strength, regarding the convening of people's representative conferences as a burden and thinking that it conflicts with the central work, resulting in the failure to convene people's representative conferences in some places when they should have been convened, and the failure to discuss and approve major issues that should have been discussed and approved by the people's representative conferences. Sometimes there was a tendency toward formalism in guidance, and the rich experience of various places was not systematically summarized. Due attention was not given to the political power construction work in industrial and mining areas and towns in a timely manner in accordance with the Party's guidelines and the development of national industrial construction. In terms of preferential treatment work: on the one hand, some cadres lacked the spirit of being responsible to the end for the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, and failed to solve some problems that should have been solved in a timely and conscientious manner as much as possible; on the other hand, some cadres did not pay attention to fully developing the labor enthusiasm of the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers with labor power, mobilizing and organizing them to actively engage in production, participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and rely on their glorious labor to solve their livelihood problems in the development of production, thus causing some of them who could have been self-sufficient in production to develop the idea of simply relying on government "supply." In terms of rural disaster relief work: the disaster situation was not grasped adequately, and the policy of production for self-relief and saving to overcome famine was not universally implemented. When distributing relief grain and funds, some areas did not cooperate well with relevant departments to effectively organize production; some areas requested excessive quantities, issued excessively high standards, and distributed relief in an average manner, resulting in waste and fostering the mentality among a small number of people of not working hard to produce and save but relying on government relief; and some areas failed to provide necessary relief to disaster victims in urgent need of relief in a timely manner. The occurrence of these shortcomings is mainly due to the fact that the civil affairs departments have subjectivism and bureaucracy in their work, lack investigation and research, fail to report the situation to the leading organs and put forward appropriate suggestions in a timely manner, fail to systematically summarize experiences in a timely manner, generalize guidance, and fail to grasp the center.
    Now China's economy has entered a period of large-scale planned construction from the period of recovery. Chairman Mao instructed: "From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the basic completion of socialist transformation is a transitional period. The general line and general task in this transitional period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce over a fairly long period of time." The work of the civil affairs departments must further implement the general line and general task of the country in the transitional period and serve the development of production and socialist transformation.
    Regarding political power construction
    I. Under the leadership of people's governments and election committees at all levels, cooperate with relevant organs to complete the universal suffrage work. After the completion of the universal suffrage work, people's congresses at all local levels shall be convened in accordance with the central regulations. In places where universal suffrage has not yet been completed, people's representative conferences should still be convened in a timely manner in accordance with the central regulations and local work needs. The completion of the national universal suffrage work and the convening of people's congresses at all levels is a more complete development of China's people's democratic dictatorship system. It marks a new stage in the construction of political power during the period of large-scale economic construction in the country. In order to lead and guarantee the smooth progress of various construction works of the country, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the working class in the state power, unite the democratic classes and the people of all nationalities through people's congresses at all levels and through various works, give play to their political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm, and improve the patriotic ideological consciousness of the people, and strive to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country; through people's congresses at all levels and through various works, strengthen the education of peasants and handicraftsmen, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and promote the development of agricultural and handicraft cooperation; through people's congresses at all levels and through various works, strengthen the education and transformation of capitalist industrialists and businessmen, and bring capitalist industry and commerce into the orbit of the national planned economy, so as to gradually complete the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce; through people's congresses at all levels and through various works, educate the people to be vigilant and expose the conspiratorial sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries, so as to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. This is the task of the entire Party and the country, and it is also the guideline and starting point for the work of the civil affairs departments. For this reason, it is necessary to correct the erroneous view that does not attach importance to the people's representative conferences or the people's congress system, and even regards its convening as a burden and conflicts with the central work. Experience shows that the people's representative conferences and the people's congresses are conducive to the working class realizing leadership, conducive to the vast majority of people concentrating and realizing their will, and capable of fully educating the people and mobilizing the people to participate in the construction of the motherland. They are the main organizational forms, and also the powerful weapons for the Party and the country to represent the people, work for the people, and rely on the people to gradually realize the general line and general task in the transitional period and guide the country onto the socialist road of happiness. The civil affairs departments must constantly educate cadres and the people with this point of view.
    II. In order to adapt to the needs of national socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of political power in cities and industrial and mining areas. We must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, systematically study and summarize, and continue to create experiences in the construction of political power and the convening of people's representative conferences or people's congresses in cities, industrial and mining areas, and small towns. All cities should complete the work of establishing neighborhood committees and street offices in accordance with the "General Rules for the Organization of Urban Neighborhood Committees" and the "General Rules for the Organization of Urban Street Offices" to be promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. Those that have been established should be rectified.
    III. Continue to strengthen and improve the rural political power organizations to adapt to the needs of the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. The township people's government should generally set up working committees according to the work of production cooperation, culture, education and health, public security, people's armed forces, civil affairs, finance and food, and mediation. Each province can merge or adjust according to the specific situation of the province, but it should not exceed seven at most. When necessary, temporary working committees may be established with the approval of the county, and they shall be announced and abolished after the work is completed. The committees should absorb township people's representatives, activists, and people with expertise to participate in the work under the principle of one person, one position. We should summarize the experience of how the rural grassroots political power organizations and systems adapt to and promote the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. We should strengthen the education of township cadres, improve their policy level, and improve their working methods through arranging and summarizing work.
    IV. The construction of political power in ethnic minority areas should continue to promote ethnic regional autonomy. Where there are ethnic affairs committees, this work should be closely coordinated with them.
    V. We must always pay attention to strengthening the people's mass supervision and criticism of state organs and their staff from the bottom up, eliminate the remaining old democratic ideas and old political power styles in the work of political power organs, and oppose bureaucracy, so as to further strengthen the ties between the people's government and the people.
    VI. The specific tasks of the civil affairs departments in the construction of political power are:
    (1) Supervise and inspect the work of the lower people's governments on convening people's congresses or people's representative conferences. Check whether the lower people's congresses or people's representative conferences are convened in a timely manner in accordance with the central regulations and local work needs; whether the major work of the people's government is submitted to the people's congresses or people's representative conferences for discussion and decision; and whether the meeting system of the government committee is sound. Summarize and promote good experiences, and criticize and correct wrong practices. (2) Study and improve the organizational forms of administrative divisions and local political power, especially grassroots political power, so that they are in line with local economic, political and other conditions and the distribution of ethnic groups, and facilitate the working people to manage the affairs of the country and their own affairs. (3) Through the people's congresses or people's representative conferences, collect the people's opinions on the implementation of the Party and government policies and decrees and on the work of the government, especially the style of work of the staff of the grassroots political power, report them to the Party and government leading organs in a timely manner, and provide suggestions for improvement. (4) Cooperate with various departments to carry out the preparations for relevant people's congresses or people's representative conferences and other specific work. (5) Closely cooperate with ethnic affairs committees at all levels to carry out the construction of political power in ethnic minority areas.
    Regarding preferential treatment work
    In order to boost the morale of the people's armed forces and strengthen national defense, the civil affairs departments must effectively lead the people to do a good job in preferential treatment work, and be truly responsible for solving the life and production problems of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers. Give play to their enthusiasm in politics and production, mobilize and organize them to actively engage in production in accordance with the road of mutual aid and cooperation, gradually establish their families, achieve self-sufficiency in production, or participate in other possible and capable work, and participate in the country's various socialist construction undertakings. For those who lack labor power or have livelihood difficulties and must be given material subsidies, provide them with cultivation on their behalf or material subsidies, and enable them to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in production as much as possible.
    To this end, the following work must be done well:
    I. We must vigorously organize the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers who have labor power or other production conditions to actively participate in various production activities. In rural areas, we should mainly mobilize and organize them to participate in agricultural and sideline production, and mobilize them to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. In cities, we should first introduce jobs to them as much as possible, conscientiously implement the regulations on their priority in employment; for those who cannot be employed, we should coordinate with relevant departments to organize them to engage in various possible cooperative small-scale production or family handicraft industries.
    The material subsidy fees for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, in addition to providing fixed-quantity and regular subsidies to the poor families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers (especially the families of revolutionary martyrs) who have no labor power, should focus on old revolutionary base areas and areas where there are more families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and are also poorer, so as to solve their actual difficulties in life and production.
    II. We should ensure that the land of the poor families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who have no labor power or lack labor power is cultivated on their behalf. Overcome the parochial view of arbitrarily expanding the area of cultivation on behalf and the one-sided view of arbitrarily reducing the area of cultivation on behalf because of emphasizing reducing the burden on the masses. We should promote a fixed system of cultivation on behalf, and gradually overcome the phenomenon of temporary assignment of labor. In areas where mutual aid and cooperation have a foundation, cultivation on behalf should be gradually combined with mutual aid and cooperation organizations under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, but fair and reasonable burden of cultivation on behalf should be achieved between members of mutual aid and cooperation organizations and between labor power inside and outside mutual aid and cooperation organizations by using methods such as collecting labor for food, so as to prevent the tendency of unreasonably adding the burden of cultivation on behalf to mutual aid and cooperation organizations.
    We must prevent and correct the unreasonable phenomenon of excessively wide exemptions from labor, which makes cultivation on behalf the burden of a small number of people. The number of township cadres exempted from labor shall be determined by the province (city) itself. Revolutionary disabled soldiers of the third grade or above should be exempted from cultivation duties on behalf. Demobilized and transferred soldiers should be exempted from cultivation duties on behalf for one year after returning to their hometown. After one year, the sick and weak may be temporarily or permanently exempted from cultivation duties on behalf with the approval of the district. Other labor power that needs to be exempted from labor should be submitted to the township people's congress for approval and reported to the district for approval. In areas where cultivation duties on behalf are heavy, the province can uniformly stipulate the maximum number of labor days that each labor force and livestock power should generally bear for cultivation on behalf, so as to avoid excessively heavy cultivation duties on behalf on the masses. The burden of cultivation on behalf is generally adjusted by the township itself; in areas with heavy burden, it can be adjusted by the district or county itself when necessary; in counties with particularly heavy burden, the province shall give appropriate subsidies with local surcharges on grain; in old revolutionary base provinces with particularly heavy burden of cultivation on behalf, the central government shall give appropriate subsidies.
    III. At present, more than 95 percent of demobilized and transferred soldiers have been properly resettled and are actively engaged in production or work, but there is still a small number who have not been properly resettled or who are not at ease with production or work even though they have been resettled. Therefore, the resettlement work of demobilized and transferred soldiers should be thoroughly inspected. Those who have been properly resettled should be encouraged to continue to work hard in production and work; those who have special difficulties should be effectively and responsibly resolved; those who have not been resettled or have not been properly resettled must be promptly and appropriately resettled in accordance with the principle of resettlement in their original place. Those who are not at ease with agricultural production should be frequently educated to understand that participating in industrial production is glorious and participating in agricultural production is also glorious, and encourage them to actively participate in various mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Those among them who meet the appropriate conditions should be absorbed to participate in militia organizations and other tasks in rural areas. Those who lack land should find ways to adjust it locally or help them switch to handicrafts or other production. Those who lack housing should also find ways to adjust it locally. If it is impossible to adjust, the government can give appropriate subsidies, mobilize the masses to help, and build their own houses. For the medical treatment of chronic patients, the main measures are to provide necessary subsidies for local medical treatment or recuperation at home. Revolutionary disabled soldiers with wounds that have not healed or recurred should be promptly treated by the local health department. For those who have indeed difficulties in production in rural areas or are not suitable for agricultural production but have the conditions to do other work, we should consult with personnel, labor and other relevant departments to gradually assign them appropriate jobs as much as possible, or organize them to participate in labor in water conservancy, ditch digging, road construction, wasteland reclamation, afforestation, farms and other aspects under possible conditions. The resettlement of demobilized and transferred soldiers in cities should be planned by the governments at all levels in a unified manner. Those who have the ability to work and have jobs to be assigned should be assigned work by the labor and personnel departments in a unified manner, and all departments must give them priority in employment. It is wrong to take a lukewarm or accommodating attitude towards demobilized and transferred soldiers. We should actively educate them to maintain the glory of revolutionary soldiers, oppose individual elements who damage the honor of revolutionary soldiers, and make them models of abiding by laws, actively producing, and linking up with the masses.
    IV. The schools for revolutionary disabled soldiers should be rectified, and the education policy of focusing on improving culture and cultivating employment conditions should be implemented. Revolutionary disabled soldiers in school should generally be given a certain degree of cultural education and technical education, and after graduation, the personnel department will uniformly assign jobs; a small number of students with the conditions for further study can apply for workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools or other technical schools after completing the primary school curriculum. Those who have difficulties in learning and the severely disabled can be allowed to go home if they have a home to go to, are willing to do so, and their families agree.
    Regarding rural disaster relief and urban relief work
    Regarding rural relief work: Although China's disaster prevention facilities are being vigorously built, it is still difficult to avoid attacks from natural disasters for a long time, and the disaster resistance capacity of farmers' individual economy is relatively weak, so it is necessary to do a good job in rural disaster relief work to protect and restore productive forces, ensure the completion of agricultural production plans, and promote the development of mutual aid and cooperation. Secondly, it is also necessary to help the people in old revolutionary base areas, poor ethnic minority areas, poor mountainous areas, poor fishermen and salt farmers along the coast, and helpless disabled, elderly, and orphans in general rural areas to produce and provide them with necessary relief.
    I. Disaster relief work must implement the policy of production for self-relief, saving to overcome famine, mass mutual aid, and supplemented by necessary government relief. Under the leadership of people's governments at all levels, disaster relief committees should be organized by relevant departments in collaboration. The specific tasks of the civil affairs departments in rural disaster relief work are: to grasp the disaster situation in a timely manner, do a good job in the distribution of relief grain and funds, check the implementation of disaster relief policies, and summarize and exchange disaster relief work experience.
    II. Disaster-stricken areas should grasp the disaster situation in a timely manner, establish a disaster reporting system, and strengthen disaster statistics work, so as to improve the initiative and planning of disaster relief work. After a disaster occurs, the disaster-stricken area should immediately make a comprehensive estimate of the disaster situation based on the existing materials, distinguishing between the severity of the disaster for the affected fields and the affected population, and prepare a temporary budget based on this to allocate funds for emergency relief. After the crops are harvested, the disaster situation should be assessed and determined in conjunction with the collection of agricultural taxes to verify the disaster situation, and the necessary relief funds should be continued to be allocated. The verification of the disaster situation should be based on the local agricultural tax reduction and exemption standards for statistics, that is: those who are completely exempted from agricultural tax due to disaster are considered severely affected, and those who are partially exempted are considered lightly affected.
    III. We must fully mobilize disaster victims to actively engage in various production activities to overcome the difficulties after the disaster. The relief grain and funds distributed by the government are to protect the lives of disaster victims, stabilize the emotions of disaster victims, maintain the labor force of disaster victims, support disaster victims to engage in production, and overcome the famine. We must correct the simple relief view of distributing relief grain and funds without combining it with organizing disaster victims to produce. Relief grain and funds must be focused on severely affected areas and urgently needed areas, distributed to disaster victims in a timely manner, and should be distributed as centrally as possible to facilitate the cooperation of various relevant departments to organize disaster victims to engage in agricultural and sideline production. Each province should determine the relief objects, standards, and time according to the self-relief ability of disaster victims and the degree of food shortage.
    IV. Implementing the policy of production for self-relief and mobilizing mass mutual aid should mainly rely on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation to give greater play to the strength of the masses and enhance disaster resistance capacity; and various original forms of mutual aid among the masses can be appropriately used to give play to the potential strength of the masses to overcome famine. However, in severely affected areas, because farmers generally have relatively empty coffers, in addition to the voluntary help of relatives and neighbors, farmers should not be forced to implement social mutual assistance, so as not to affect the internal unity of farmers and the production enthusiasm of some farmers. The existing community granaries should not be added to, but should be rectified to gradually develop in the direction of credit cooperatives. In the future, it should no longer be advocated to run community granaries. Work relief has played a very good role in disaster relief work. In the future, when the water conservancy, transportation, agriculture, forestry and other departments carry out various construction projects in disaster areas, they should organize disaster victims with labor power to participate under the principle of not affecting agricultural production, but the wages paid should not be too low, and disaster victims should not be mobilized to do voluntary work; at the same time, the cost of construction projects should not be expanded for the sake of disaster relief without following the principle of economic accounting.
    V. In order to prevent spring famine from occurring in areas affected by disasters this autumn and chronically poor areas in the spring and summer season next year, it is necessary to cooperate with relevant departments to vigorously carry out winter production and thrift campaigns to carry out prevention. Disaster victims should be organized to cooperate with each other to carry out various sideline production activities in a planned way, and specific assistance, guidance, and control should be given in terms of funds, raw materials, sales channels, varieties, specifications, and prices. We must conscientiously implement the policy of saving to overcome famine, educate the masses in disaster areas to save money, especially to advocate collecting more substitutes and exchanging fine grains for coarse grains to save food. We should commend saving models, disseminate the masses' experience in saving to overcome famine, and pay attention to preventing disaster victims from blindly flowing into cities.
    Regarding urban relief work: For the helpless, unable to maintain their lives, disabled, elderly, orphans, and the poor, as well as vagrants, etc., they should be given care, relief, or labor reform according to their labor capacity, depending on the need and possibility. For all people with labor capacity, ways should be found to enable them to participate in labor in cities or in rural areas to support themselves. We must correct the erroneous view of wanting to take over all the poor people and vagrants in the city at once and provide them all with relief.
    I. Impoverished urban residents who are unable to maintain their lives should be encouraged and helped to find their own lives. When necessary, they should be supported to carry out various regular or seasonal cooperative handicraft industries and small-scale processing production, or participate in work relief. Helpless, unable to maintain their lives, disabled, elderly, and orphans should be given necessary relief. Those who cannot maintain their lives, as well as those who need relief due to disasters such as floods and fires, diseases, deaths, and childbirths, should be given temporary relief.
    II. Continue to rectify production and education homes. Production and education homes should accommodate and care for helpless, unable to maintain their lives, disabled, elderly, and orphans, and should not indiscriminately accept people regardless of the object. Those who have been accommodated should be reviewed and cleaned up. Vagrants and beggars should be organized to participate in labor so that they can support themselves and gradually find employment. Production and education homes should organize the accommodated personnel to engage in various possible production labor in accordance with the principles of small investment, accommodating more people, and easy operation, such as agriculture, handicrafts, processing industry, and participation in engineering teams. School-age children should be given primary cultural education and possible technical education by means of part-work and part-study. Cultivate their ability to support themselves. Leadership over production and education homes must be strengthened, cadres must be appropriately equipped, management methods for accommodated personnel must be improved, ideological education must be strengthened, labor rewards must be implemented for participants, appropriate transformation periods must be stipulated according to different objects, and beating, abuse, and other illegal and undisciplined phenomena must be strictly prohibited. This work should be carried out in collaboration with the relief branch in cities where the China People's Relief Branch is located.
    Regarding the implementation of the Marriage Law, population
        investigation and registration, land administration
        and civilian labor mobilization

    The implementation of the Marriage Law is a long-term and arduous process of social reform and self-education of the people, so this work must be listed as one of the regular tasks. All localities should appropriately allocate full-time cadres to handle marriage registration work in accordance with the "Instructions on the General Establishment of Marriage Registration Institutions" issued by the Government Administration Council in April 1953, and do a good job in marriage registration work. Under the unified leadership of the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee, the judicial departments and people's organizations such as women, youth, and workers should be coordinated to regularly check and study the implementation of the Marriage Law, and carry out publicity and education on the Marriage Law to grassroots cadres and the masses. For cases of general violations of the Marriage Law and minor circumstances among the masses, the policy of criticism and education should be mainly adopted, but for those who seriously violate the Marriage Law, abuse or kill women, the people's court should impose sanctions at any time.
    The national population figures are an important basis for compiling socialist economic plans and carrying out various construction works. At present, in the universal suffrage work, the civil affairs departments should complete the population investigation and registration work in coordination with relevant departments, and on this basis, gradually establish a simple household registration system. In rural areas, births, deaths, immigration, and emigration should be reported to the resident group leader at any time, and the resident group leader should report to the township people's government for registration on a regular basis. The township people's government should verify and report statistics annually in conjunction with the collection of agricultural taxes. The public security department is responsible for residents in towns, industrial and mining areas, and aquatic residential areas. The local civil affairs department should regularly report statistics based on the materials of the public security department. The people's governments of provinces and counties in ethnic minority and remote areas may formulate other methods suitable for local specific conditions and report statistics regularly.
    During the transitional period, there are many issues related to land administration. In places where there is no dedicated agency in charge of this work, the civil affairs departments should be in charge of this work, so that the national land policy can adapt to urban construction and the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the future collectivization of agriculture. And deal with the relevant land issues left over from the land reform. At present, the focus of work should be on handling this issue in accordance with the "Measures for Land Requisition for National Construction" to correct some of the current confusion in construction land use.
    For the needs of national defense construction and economic construction, the civil affairs departments should be responsible for the civilian labor mobilization work for national defense construction. In areas where there is no labor department, they should also assist relevant construction units in mobilizing the requisition and employment of rural civilian workers in major economic construction. The user department is responsible for the organization and leadership of civilian workers. Attention should be paid to balancing the labor burden during mobilization, and the wage treatment, safety, and health of civilian workers should be handled in consultation with relevant departments.
    Regarding the scope of business and
        organizational construction of civil affairs departments
    I. The main businesses of the civil affairs departments are political construction, preferential treatment, relief, land administration, household registration, nationality, administrative divisions, civilian labor mobilization, marriage registration, social group registration, and other works. Among the businesses previously managed by the civil affairs departments, some already have other competent departments, and some have closer relationships with other departments or are closer in nature of work. They should be discussed with relevant departments to formulate measures and report to the Government Administration Council for approval to transfer them to other departments for management.
    II. Because the preferential treatment and relief work of the civil affairs departments are very heavy, the agencies in charge of this work must be appropriately strengthened. A preferential treatment and relief section should be set up in counties that meet one of the following conditions: (1) Families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers account for more than one-tenth of the county's population; (2) There are more than 30,000 families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers; (3) The disaster situation has been relatively serious for years. In other counties (cities and urban districts), preferential treatment and relief cadres should be set up in the civil affairs section. The civil affairs bureaus (bureaus) of provinces (cities) should establish and enrich preferential treatment and relief agencies (divisions or sections). The preferential treatment department of the central Ministry of Internal Affairs was changed to a bureau. The number of staff to be added to the civil affairs departments and preferential treatment and relief agencies of the major administrative regions, provinces (cities), and counties should be uniformly adjusted by the people's governments of the major administrative regions and provinces (cities) among the departments in the region or the civil affairs departments themselves according to the complexity of civil affairs work. Efforts should be made to avoid excessive mobility of cadres in civil affairs departments at all levels, especially the backbone cadres in civil affairs at the county and special district levels, so as to be familiar with the situation, accumulate experience, and improve work; those who have been transferred away from key cadres who affect work should be replenished.
    Regarding strengthening learning and improving work style
    In order to successfully complete the various tasks of the civil affairs departments, we must strengthen the theoretical and policy learning of civil affairs cadres and improve the work style and working methods.
    I. We should strengthen the training of incumbent civil affairs staff. In 1954, civil affairs classes should be attached to the political and legal cadre schools, political and legal colleges and administrative cadre schools of the provinces in the major administrative regions to train the leading backbone of county-level civil affairs departments in a short-term rotational training mode, and provinces with conditions should begin to rotate training civil affairs staff. All civil affairs cadres must strengthen the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism, strengthen the study of advanced Soviet experience, and at present, we must first strengthen the study of the general line of the Party and the country and the specific policies related to work. We must conscientiously summarize the practical experience in our work, systematize it, and use it to improve the policy level of cadres.
    II. Strengthen the leadership of the working class ideology and eliminate the influence of the old democratic views and formalism of the bourgeoisie in civil affairs work. Civil affairs departments at all levels must prevent and overcome decentralism. They should regularly report the work situation to the Party and government leading organs, proactively put forward work opinions, and ask the Party and government leading organs to give instructions.
    III. Oppose bureaucracy and subjectivism, and establish the work style of going deep into reality, conducting investigations and research, following the mass line, and proceeding from reality. When guiding work, we must pay attention to the imbalance in the political, economic, cultural and work development of various regions, and we must systematically understand the basic situation of civil affairs work in various regions. Civil affairs departments at all levels should regularly conduct in-depth inspections of work and summarize typical experiences.
    IV. Civil affairs work has a large amount of business.

    第二次全国民政会议决议
    （一九五三年十二月十日政务院第一百九十七次政务会议批准）
    第二次全国民政会议听取并讨论了谢觉哉部长关于四年来民政工作的总结和今后任务的报告，一致同意报告的精神并作如下决议：
    四年来的民政工作，由于中国共产党与各级人民政府的正确领导，由于全国人民和全体民政干部以及其他有关部门的共同努力，获得了很大的成绩。在政权建设工作方面：全国地方各级人民代表会议至一九五二年底已普遍召开，省（市）人民代表会议和三分之一以上的县、三分之二以上的市人民代表会议已经代行了人民代表大会的职权，并结合各项社会改革运动对基层政权进行了整顿。少数民族地区，多数召开了各族各界人民代表会议，并建立了各级的民族自治区和民族民主联合政府。这对团结各族各界人民、巩固人民民主专政、组织和推动各项社会改革和生产建设，都起了很大的作用，并为召开普选的各级人民代表大会打下了良好的基础。在优抚工作方面：随着抗美援朝运动的开展和深入，发动了群众性的拥军优属运动，提高了革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人的政治地位，增强了人民群众的爱国主义的思想觉悟。各地对于有劳动力的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属，发动他们努力耕种好了自己的土地，对于缺乏劳动力的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属，则发动群众进行了代耕，被代耕的土地约五千余万亩，对于生活困难的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属，则给予了实物补助，受过实物补助的约六百余万人；对革命残废军人均给予了抚恤，并办理了六十七所革命残废军人学校和三十三所革命残废军人教养院；对复员转业军人进行了安置，使他们参加了生产和各项建设事业。这些对鼓舞士气、巩固国防、支援解放战争和抗美援朝战争都起了很大的作用。在农村救灾工作方面：对遭受自然灾害的地区，组织灾民进行了生产自救，四年来仅从中央即拨发了四万二千七百余亿元的救济款，维护了灾民的劳动力，援助灾民胜利地渡过了灾荒。在城市救济工作方面：在中国人民救济总会及其分会配合下，改造游民和教养贫苦无依的残老孤幼共三十六万人，救济贫苦市民每年约一百二十余万人，接收和改造了过去为帝国主义所操纵把持借以进行破坏活动的所谓“慈善”机关四百二十多个，并从其中肃清了帝国主义的影响。此外，各级民政部门配合有关方面在民工动员、地政、户政、贯彻婚姻法以及由当地政府交办的其他任务中也进行了许多工作，取得了不少成绩。
    但是，在民政工作中，四年来也有不少的缺点。在政权建设工作方面：有些干部对民主是力量的源泉还缺乏认识，把召开人民代表会议看成负担，以为与中心工作有矛盾，致有些地方的人民代表会议应该召开时却没有召开，应该经过人民代表会议讨论和通过的重大问题，却没有那样做。在指导上有时存在着形式主义的偏向，对各地的丰富经验没有系统地加以总结。对工矿区、城镇的政权建设工作，未能根据党的方针和国家工业建设的发展及时予以应有的注意。在优抚工作方面：一方面有些干部对革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人缺乏负责到底的精神，对有些应该解决的问题没有及时认真地尽可能地予以解决；另一方面，又有些干部没有注意充分发扬有劳动力的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人及复员转业军人的劳动积极性，发动和组织他们积极地从事生产、参加互助合作组织，依靠自己光荣的劳动，在发展生产中来解决自己的生活问题，因而使他们中的一部分本可生产自给的人却产生了单纯依靠政府“供给”的思想。在农村救灾工作方面：掌握灾情不够，生产自救、节约渡荒的方针没有普遍地贯彻下去。在发放救济粮款时，有些地区没有很好地配合有关部门切实组织生产；有的地区要的数量过大，发的标准过高，平均发放，造成浪费，助长了少数群众自己不努力生产节约而依赖政府救济的心理；有的对急需救济的灾民，又未能及时予以必要的救济。这些缺点的发生，主要是由于民政部门在工作上存在着主观主义、官僚主义，缺乏调查研究；没有及时地向领导机关反映情况和提出适当建议；没有及时地系统地总结经验，指导一般化，抓不住中心。
  现在我国经济已从恢复时期进入到大规模的有计划的建设时期。毛主席指示：“从中华人民共和国成立，到社会主义改造基本完成，这是一个过渡时期。在这个过渡时期的总路线和总任务，是要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和对农业、对手工业、对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。”民政部门的工作必须进一步地贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务，为发展生产和社会主义改造服务。
    关于政权建设工作
    一、在各级人民政府及选举委员会的领导下，与有关机关配合完成普选工作。普选工作完成后，地方各级人民代表大会应照中央规定召开。在普选尚未完成的地方，仍应按中央规定与当地工作需要及时召开人民代表会议。全国普选工作的完成和各级人民代表大会的召开，是我国人民民主专政制度的更加完备的发展，它标志着在国家大规模的经济建设时期政权建设的新阶段。为了领导和保障国家各种建设工作的顺利进行，必须加强工人阶级在国家政权中的领导，通过各级人民代表大会，通过各种工作，团结各民主阶级和各民族人民，发挥其政治积极性与生产积极性，提高人民爱国主义的思想觉悟，为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化而奋斗；通过各级人民代表大会，通过各种工作，加强对农民和手工业者的教育，巩固工农联盟，以促进农业和手工业合作化的发展；通过各级人民代表大会，通过各种工作，加强对资本主义工商业者的教育与改造，把资本主义工商业纳入国家计划经济的轨道，以逐步完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造；通过各级人民代表大会，通过各种工作，教育人民警惕和揭发反革命分子的阴谋破坏行为，以巩固人民民主专政。这是整个党和国家的任务，也是民政部门工作的指针和出发点。为此，必须纠正那种不重视人民代表会议或人民代表大会制度，甚至把它的召开认为是负担、与中心工作有矛盾的错误观点。经验指明：人民代表会议和人民代表大会，是便利于工人阶级实现领导，便利于最大多数人民集中和实现其意志，和能够充分教育人民、发动人民参加祖国建设事业的主要的组织形式，同时也是党和国家代表人民、为了人民和依靠人民逐步实现过渡时期的总路线总任务，引导国家走上社会主义幸福之路的有力的武器。民政部门必须经常以这种观点教育干部和人民群众。
    二、为了适应国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的需要，必须加强城市和工矿区的政权建设工作。要学习苏联的先进经验，系统地研究总结和继续创造城市、工矿区、小城镇政权建设和召开人民代表会议或人民代表大会的经验。各城市应依中央人民政府政务院即将颁布的“城市居民委员会组织通则”、“城市街道办事处组织通则”完成建立居民委员会与街道办事处的工作，已经建立起来的应加以整顿。
    三、继续加强和健全农村政权组织，使之适应农业互助合作运动发展的需要。乡人民政府一般应按生产合作、文教卫生、治安保卫、人民武装、民政、财粮、调解等方面的工作分设工作委员会，各省可依本省具体情况合并或调整，但最多不得超过七个。必要时经县批准得设临时工作委员会，工作完毕后即行宣布撤销。各委员会应在一人一职的原则下吸收乡人民代表、积极分子及有专长的人参加工作。应总结农村基层政权组织、制度如何适应和促进农业互助合作运动发展的经验。应通过布置与总结工作，加强对乡干部的教育，提高其政策水平，改进其工作方法。
    四、少数民族地区的政权建设工作，应继续推行民族区域自治，有民族事务委员会的地方，此项工作应与之密切配合协同进行。
    五、必须经常注意加强人民对国家机关及其工作人员自下而上的群众性的监督和批评，肃清政权机关工作中的残余的旧民主思想和旧政权作风，反对官僚主义，以进一步密切人民政府与人民群众的联系。
    六、民政部门在政权建设上的具体任务是：
  （1）督促检查下级人民政府关于召开人民代表大会或人民代表会议的工作。检查下级人民代表大会或人民代表会议是否按照中央规定及当地工作需要及时召开；人民政府的重大工作是否交人民代表大会或人民代表会议讨论并作出决定；政府委员会的会议制度是否健全。总结推广好的经验，批判纠正错误的做法。（2）研究改进行政区划及地方政权特别是基层政权的组织形式，使之符合于当地经济、政治等条件及民族分布情况，便利于劳动人民管理国家的事务和自己的事务。（3）通过人民代表大会或人民代表会议，搜集人民群众对党和政府的政策、法令的施行及对政府工作特别是对基层政权工作人员作风的意见，及时反映给党政领导机关，并提供改进意见。（4）协同各部门进行有关同级人民代表大会或人民代表会议的筹备及其他具体工作。（5）与各级民族事务委员会密切配合，进行少数民族地区的政权建设工作。
    关于优抚工作
    为了鼓舞人民武装部队的士气，以增强国防力量，民政部门必须切实领导人民群众做好优抚工作，对革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人的生活和生产问题切实负责予以解决。发挥他们在政治上和生产上的积极性，发动和组织他们按照互助合作的道路积极从事生产，逐步建立家务，达到生产自给，或参加其他可能的和力能胜任的工作，参加国家的各种社会主义建设事业。对于缺乏劳动力或生活贫困必须予以物质补助的，给以代耕或物质的补助，并使他们也尽可能地逐步达到生产自给。
    为此必须做好下列工作：
    一、必须大力组织革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人中有劳动力或其他生产条件的积极参加各种生产。在农村，主要是动员组织他们参加农业和副业生产，在自愿互利原则下，动员他们参加互助合作组织。在城市，应首先尽可能为他们介绍职业，认真贯彻关于他们有就业优先权的规定；对不能就业的，应协同有关部门组织他们从事各种可能的合作社性质的小型生产或家庭手工业。
    革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的实物补助费，除对没有劳动力的贫苦革命烈士家属、革命军人家属（尤其是革命烈士家属）予以定量、定期补助外，应着重用在老区和革命烈士家属、革命军人家属较多而又较贫的地区，以解决他们生活和生产上的实际困难。
    二、应确实保证无劳动力或缺乏劳动力的贫苦革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的土地得到代耕。克服任意扩大代耕面的本位观点和因强调减轻群众负担而任意缩小代耕面的片面观点。应推行固定代耕制度，逐步克服临时派工现象。在互助合作已有基础的地区，应在自愿互利的原则下使代耕逐步与互助合作组织相结合，但应用齐工找粮等方法，使互助合作组织的成员间与互助合作组织内外的劳动力之间在代耕负担上达到公平合理，防止把代耕负担不合理地加给互助合作组织的偏向。
    必须防止与纠正免勤面过宽，使代耕成为少数人负担的不合理现象。乡村干部免勤的人数，由省（市）自行规定。三等以上革命残废军人应免服代耕勤务。复员转业军人回乡后应免服代耕勤务一年，一年后，病弱者经区批准仍可临时或长期减免其代耕勤务。其他需免勤的劳动力应提交乡人民代表大会通过，报区批准。在代耕勤务较重地区，可由省统一规定每一个劳力、畜力一般应负担代耕的最高工数，以免群众负担代耕勤务过重。代耕负担一般以乡为单位自行调整；负担较重地区，必要时可以区或县为单位自行调整；负担特重的县，由省用地方附加粮酌予补助；代耕负担特重的老区省份，由中央酌予补助。
    三、现在复员转业军人，已经有百分之九十五以上的人得到了适当安置，积极从事生产或工作，但仍有一小部分未得到妥善安置或者虽已安置了而其本人却不安心生产或工作。因此，对复员转业军人的安置工作应进行深入检查，对于已经安置好了的，应鼓励他们继续努力生产和工作；对其中有特殊困难的，应切实负责予以解决；对尚未得到安置或没有安置好的，必须根据在原籍安置的原则，协同有关部门迅速适当加以安置，并应对不安心于农业生产的经常进行教育，使他们了解参加工业生产是光荣的，参加农业生产也是光荣的，鼓励他们积极参加各种互助合作组织。对于他们中条件适当的人应吸收其参加民兵组织和乡村中的其他各项工作。对缺乏土地者，应设法就地调剂或帮助其转营手工业或其他生产。对缺少房屋者，也应设法就地调剂，如无法调剂时，可由政府给予适当补助，动员群众帮工，自行修建。对慢性病员的医疗，主要采取予以必要补助就地医疗或在家休养的办法。对伤口未愈或复发的革命残废军人，应由当地卫生部门迅速设法予以治疗。对在农村生产确有困难或不适于农业生产而有条件做其他工作者，应商同人事、劳动等有关部门尽可能逐步分配以适当工作，或在可能条件下组织他们参加治水、挖渠、修路、垦荒、造林、农场等方面的劳动。城市中复员转业军人的安置，应由各级政府统一筹划，凡有工作能力和有工作可分配的应由劳动和人事部门统一分配工作，各部门必须给他们以优先就业的便利。对复员转业军人采取冷淡或迁就的态度都是错误的。应积极教育他们保持革命军人的光荣，反对个别的破坏革命军人荣誉的分子，使之成为遵守法令、积极生产、联系群众的模范。
    四、对革命残废军人学校应加以整顿，要贯彻以提高文化与培养就业条件为主的教育方针。对在校的革命残废军人，一般应施以一定程度的文化教育和技术教育，毕业后统由人事部门分配工作；少数具有深造条件的学员，在学完小学课程后即可报考工农速成中学或其他技术学校。对学习有困难的及重残废人员，凡有家可归、本人自愿、家庭同意者可准其回家。
    关于农村救灾和城市救济工作
    关于农村救济工作：目前我国防灾设施虽在大力建设，但在相当长的时期内，自然灾害的袭击尚难避免，而农民个体经济的抗灾能力又较薄弱，因此必须做好农村救灾工作，以保护和恢复生产力，保证农业生产计划的完成，促进互助合作的发展。其次，对革命老根据地、贫苦的少数民族区、贫瘠山区的人民，沿海贫苦渔民、盐民，以及一般农村生活无着的残老孤幼，也必须扶助其生产并予以必要的救济。
    一、救灾工作必须贯彻生产自救、节约渡荒、群众互助并辅以政府必要救济的方针，在各级人民政府领导下组织生产救灾委员会，由各有关部门协同进行。民政部门在农村救灾工作中的具体任务是：及时掌握灾情，做好救济粮款的发放工作，检查救灾政策的执行情况，总结交流救灾工作经验。
    二、有灾地区应及时掌握灾情，建立报灾制度，加强灾情统计工作，以提高救灾工作的主动性和计划性。灾情发生后，有灾地区应即依据已有材料，对受灾田亩和受灾人口分别轻重做出灾情的全面估算，并据以编造临时预算，拨款进行急救。遭灾农作物收获之后，结合农业税征收工作评产定灾，核实灾情，再续拨必需的救济费。核实灾情应以当地农业税减免标准为依据进行统计，即：因灾歉农业税全部免征者为重灾，一部免征者为轻灾。
    三、必须充分发动灾民积极进行各种生产，以克服灾后的困难。政府发放的救济粮款是为了救护灾民的生命，稳定灾民的情绪，维护灾民的劳动力，支持灾民进行生产，渡过灾荒。必须纠正发放救济粮款不结合组织灾民生产的单纯救济观点。救济粮款必须有重点地投放在重灾区和迫切需要的方面，及时发到灾民手中，并应尽可能地集中发放，以便于配合各有关部门组织灾民从事农业和副业生产。各省应依灾民生产自救能力的大小和缺粮程度等条件，确定救济对象、标准和时间。
    四、贯彻生产自救和发动群众互助的方针，应主要依靠农业生产互助合作，以更大地发挥群众力量，增强抗灾能力；并可适当地利用群众间原有的各种互助形式，以发挥群众渡荒的潜在力量。但在重灾区，因农民家底一般比较空虚，除亲邻自愿的相帮外，不要勉强农民实行社会互济，以免影响农民内部的团结和一部分农民的生产积极性。现有的义仓，不应再添仓，应加以整顿，使之逐步向信用合作社方向发展，今后不应再提倡举办义仓。以工代赈在救灾工作上起过很好的作用，今后水利、交通、农林等部门在灾区兴办各项建设工程时，在不影响农业生产的原则下，应组织有劳动力的灾民参加，但所付工资不得过低，更不应动员灾民做义务工；同时，也不应不按经济核算制的原则，因救灾而扩大建筑工程的费用。
    五、为防止今秋有灾地区和常年贫困地区，在明年青黄不接之际，发生春荒，必须配合有关部门大力开展冬季生产节约运动，进行预防。要组织灾民互助合作，有计划地进行各种副业生产，并在资金、原料、销路、品种、规格、价格等方面加以具体帮助、指导和掌握。必须认真贯彻节约渡荒的方针，教育灾区群众省吃俭用，特别要提倡多收集代食品和用细粮换粗粮，以节约粮食。要表扬节约模范，传播群众的节约渡荒经验，并注意防止灾民盲目流入城市。
    关于城市救济工作：对无依无靠无法维持生活的残老孤幼和贫民以及游民等，应根据必要和可能按其有无劳动力分别予以教养、救济或劳动改造，对一切有劳动能力的人，应设法使其在城市或去农村参加劳动，以自食其力。必须纠正那些想把城市所有贫民、游民等一下子包下来，都施以救济的错误观点。
      一、对无法维持生活的贫苦市民，应鼓励和帮助其自谋生活，必要时应扶助他们进行各种经常的或季节性的合作社性质的手工业及小型加工生产，或参加以工代赈。对无依无靠、无法维持生活的残老孤幼，予以必要的救济。对不能维持生活之贫苦市民以及因水火灾害、疾病、死亡、生育等不能生活需要救济者，予以临时救济。
    二、继续整顿生产教养院。生产教养院应收容教养无依无靠、无法维持生活的残老孤幼，不应不分对象地乱收，对已收容者应进行审查清理。对游民乞丐应组织他们参加劳动，使之自食其力，逐渐就业。生产教养院应根据投资少、容人多、操作容易等原则，组织收容人员从事各种可能的生产劳动，如农业、手工业、加工工业及参加工程队等。对收容的学龄儿童应采取半工半读办法，施以初等文化教育和可能的技术教育。培养其自谋生活的能力。必须加强对生产教养院的领导，适当配备干部，改进对收容人员的管理方法，加强思想教育，对参加人员实行劳动奖励，根据不同对象规定适当改造期限，严禁打骂虐待和其他违法乱纪现象。此项工作在设有中国人民救济分会的城市中，应与救济分会协同进行。
    关于贯彻婚姻法工作、人口
        调查登记工作、地政工作
        和民工动员工作
    婚姻法的贯彻是一个长期艰巨的社会改革过程和人民群众自我教育的过程，因此必须把这一工作列为经常工作之一。各地应根据政务院一九五三年四月“关于普遍建立婚姻登记机构的指示”，适当调配办理婚姻登记工作的专职干部，做好婚姻登记工作。应在贯彻婚姻法运动委员会统一领导下，协同司法部门和妇女、青年、工人等人民团体定期地检查和研究执行婚姻法的情况，对基层干部和群众进行关于婚姻法的宣传教育，对群众中违犯婚姻法的一般情节较轻的案件，主要采取批评教育的方针，但对严重违犯婚姻法、虐待或杀害妇女的分子应由人民法院随时加以制裁。
    国家的人口数字是编制社会主义经济计划和进行各项建设工作的重要依据。目前在普选工作中，民政部门应在有关部门协同下完成人口调查登记工作，并在此基础上，逐步建立简易的户口登记制度。在农村，人口的出生、死亡、迁入、迁出应随时向居民小组长报告，由居民小组长定期向乡人民政府报请登记，乡人民政府每年结合农业税征收工作，进行核对，统计上报。在城镇、工矿、水上居民区由公安部门负责，当地民政部门应根据公安部门材料定期统计上报。在少数民族及边远地区省、县人民政府可另行制订适合于当地具体情况的办法，定期统计上报。
    在过渡时期，有关地政的问题很多，在没有专设掌管此项工作机构的地方，民政部门应掌管此项工作，使国家土地政策能适应城市建设和农村互助合作运动以及将来农业集体化的需要。并处理土地改革遗留的有关土地问题，目前应根据“国家建设征用土地办法”以处理此项问题为工作重点，以纠正目前建设用地中的某些混乱现象。
    为了国防建设和经济建设的需要，民政部门应负责关于国防建设的民工动员工作，在没有劳动部门的地区，并应协助有关的建设单位进行重大经济建设中的征雇农村民工的动员工作。民工的组织领导由使用部门负责。在动员时应注意平衡劳力负担问题，并与有关部门协商处理关于民工的工资待遇与安全、卫生问题。
    关于民政部门的业务范围和
        组织建设
    一、民政部门的主管业务为建政、优抚、救济、地政、户政、国籍、行政区划、民工动员、婚姻登记，社团登记等工作。过去民政部门所掌管的业务中，有些已另有主管部门，有些与其他部门关系更密切或工作性质更相近，应分别会同有关部门拟定办法报请政务院批准移交其他部门去管。
    二、由于民政部门的优抚、救济工作都很繁重，必须适当加强主管此项工作的机构。凡具备下列条件之一的县，应设优抚救济科：（1）革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人占全县人口十分之一以上者；（2）革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人在三万人以上者；（3）灾情连年比较严重者。其他县（市及市辖区）则在民政科内酌设优抚救济干部。省（市）民政厅（局）应设立和充实优抚及救济机构（处或科）。中央内务部的优抚司改为局。大区、省（市）、县民政部门及优抚救济机构应增设之编制人数，由大区、省
  （市）人民政府根据民政工作繁简情况，在本地区各部门间或民政部门本身统一调整之。对各级民政部门的干部尤其是县、专级的民政骨干干部，应力求避免过多的流动，以便熟悉情况，积累经验，改进工作；已调走主要干部影响工作者，应予补充。
    关于加强学习与改进工作作风
    为了胜利完成民政部门的各项任务，必须加强民政干部的理论政策学习，并改进工作作风与工作方法。
    一、应加强训练在职的民政工作人员。一九五四年应在各大区的政法干校、政法学院与省的行政干校内附设民政班，以短期轮训方式训练县级民政部门的领导骨干，有条件的省并应开始轮训民政科员。全体民政干部必须加强对马克思列宁主义的理论学习，加强对苏联先进经验的学习，目前首先要加强对党和国家的总路线和有关工作的具体政策的学习。要认真地总结工作中的实际经验，加以条理化，用以提高干部的政策水平。
    二、加强工人阶级思想的领导，肃清资产阶级的旧民主观点和形式主义在民政工作中的影响。各级民政部门必须防止与克服分散主义，应向党政领导机关经常报告工作情况，主动提出工作意见，请党政领导机关予以指示。
    三、反对官僚主义和主观主义，树立深入实际、调查研究、走群众路线、从实际出发的作风。在指导工作时必须注意各地区政治、经济、文化和工作上发展的不平衡性，要有计划地了解各种不同地区的有关民政工作的基本情况。各级民政部门要经常深入检查工作和总结典型经验。
    四、民政工作业务繁多，必须根据当前总的任务和当地具体情况掌握工作重点，并抓住各项工作中的主要环节推动工作前进；同时必须在党政统一领导下，密切与有关部门的联系，主动地取得有关部门的配合。
                ×  ×  ×
    本决议经政务院批准后，各省（市）应分别召开民政会议，进行传达和讨论，同时根据本省情况，制订实施计划。各省（市）的实施计划应于一九五四年三月前报大行政区行政委员会和中央内务部备案。中央内务部、大区民政局应派出工作组，检查传达情况。中央内务部应在一九五四年内召开
  一次全国民政会议和必要的专业会议，以深入解决决议贯彻执行中的各项问题。
