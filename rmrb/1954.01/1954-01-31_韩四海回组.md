　　Han Sihai Returns to the Group
　　Hu Xiyin
　　At a recent meeting to promote the general line, Han Sihai felt very frustrated after listening to propagandist Shi Baoshan explain why farmers should sell surplus grain to the state and why they should participate in mutual aid and cooperation and take the socialist road. When he got home, he couldn't even eat his meal. He stared blankly at his rice bowl, deep in thought, which confused his wife.
　　Han Sihai is from Siluo Village (Second District, Fourth Township, Dali County, Shaanxi). He is good at farming, and can handle any task with ease. The villagers often say, "Old Han is an expert in farming." In the old society, Han Sihai was a poor man. Although he had fifteen mu of dry land, the grain he harvested was not enough to pay the "official taxes" levied by the Kuomintang. His family of four lived in two dilapidated houses, constantly lacking food and clothing. After liberation, he was allocated five mu of land in the land reform and participated in a mutual aid group. The yield from the land increased year by year. He built four new houses and bought a cow and a horse, and his life changed dramatically. However, he took a wrong turn, focusing solely on personal wealth, and bought another sixteen mu of land. He kept clamoring to withdraw from the group. The group members tried to persuade him to stay, but he wouldn't listen. In the end, he withdrew from the group and went solo.
　　Now, Han Sihai thought about all this and felt sad for a long time, planning to go to the mutual aid group and ask to rejoin.
　　But as soon as he went out, he turned back. He remembered how everyone had tried so hard to persuade him to stay when he withdrew from the group. How could he have the face to ask to rejoin? What if they scolded him and he couldn't rejoin, how embarrassing would that be!
　　After pondering it over and over again, he finally made up his mind: "I can't keep making mistakes! As long as everyone lets me rejoin, I'll do whatever they say."
　　After dinner, the group members crowded into a room to discuss this year's bumper harvest plan. Han Sihai entered the room with his head lowered. When everyone saw him come in, they happily stood up and offered him a seat.
　　"Old Han, have you heard? Your life is much better now than before, but it's still far behind the Soviet farmers! We've just gotten started, can we stop moving forward?"
　　Before the group leader finished speaking, group member Wang Tongcai patted Han Sihai on the shoulder and continued, "Old Han, if you want the good life of Soviet farmers, you have to listen to Chairman Mao's words and organize yourselves, from mutual aid groups to semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives, and then to fully socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives. When our country's industry is developed, we can use machines to farm. The benefits will be endless."
　　Han Sihai was about to speak when another group member, Cheng Sirong, rushed up to persuade him, "Cheer up, remember Chairman Mao's words, and come back to the group."
　　Everyone's enthusiastic words moved Han Sihai so much that he didn't know what to say, and tears involuntarily streamed down his face. He said excitedly, "I came tonight to ask to rejoin the group. As long as everyone agrees, I'll make any self-criticism, and I guarantee that I'll never leave the mutual aid group again, and I'll always walk with everyone."
　　"Sihai is back, welcome! Welcome!" A burst of applause and cheers rang out in the room.

　　韩四海回组
    扈西印
    在最近一次宣传总路线的会议上，韩四海听了宣传员石宝山讲解农民为啥要卖余粮给国家、为啥要参加互助合作、走社会主义的道路后，心里非常懊丧。回到家里，连饭也吃不下去，呆呆地看着饭碗想心事，弄的他老婆也摸不着头脑。
    韩四海是厮罗寨村人（陕西大荔县二区四乡）作得一手好庄稼，不论捉住哪件活，都是拿得起、放得下。村里人常说：“老韩是庄稼行里的老手。”在旧社会里，韩四海原是穷汉，虽说有十五亩旱地，打的粮食，却不够缴国民党派的“官款”。一家四口人，住着两间破房，终年缺吃少穿。解放后，他在土地改革中分到了五亩地，参加了互助组，地里的产量，一年比一年打的多了。盖了四间新房，买了一头牛、一匹马，光景大变样。可是他却走了岔路，一心想个人发财，又接连买了十六亩地，整天嚷着要退组，组员们千留万留，也留他不下，最后，他终于退组单干了。
    现在，韩四海想到这些，难过了好一阵，打算到互助组里去要求回组。
    可是刚出门，又折了回来。想起退组的时候，大家千留万留，怎好意思向大家提出回组呢？要是叫人家训一顿，落个回不了组，多丢人！
    又反复闷想了一阵，最后他打定了主意：“不能一错再错呀！只要大家让我回组，大家说啥我都行。”
    吃饭后，组员们挤在屋里讨论今年的丰产计划。韩四海低着头也进了屋子。大家一看他进来了，都高高兴兴地站起来给他让坐位。
    “老韩，听见了吗？如今你的日子比先前好得多了，可是跟苏联农民比起来，还是差的多哩！咱们刚提起腿，就能不前进了吗？”
    组长的话还没落点，组员王统才拍了拍韩四海的肩膀，接着说：“老韩，想过苏联农民的好光景，就得好好听毛主席的话，组织起来，从互助组到半社会主义的农业生产合作社，再到完全社会主义的农业生产合作社。咱国家工业发达了，再能用机器种地。那好处就说不完了。”
    韩四海正想开口，另一个组员成思荣抢上来劝他：“想开些，记住毛主席的话，还是回到组里来吧。”
    大家这番热情的话，把韩四海感动得不知说啥是好，两眼不由自主地掉下了眼泪。他兴奋地说：“今晚我来，就是想回组，只要大家答应，我怎样检讨都行，保证今后再不出互助组，再怎也跟大家一起走。”
    “四海回来了，欢迎！欢迎！”屋里响起一阵掌声和欢嚷声。
