　　Remarkable Achievements in Railway Construction and Transportation Last Year
    In the first year of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan, railway construction developed accordingly, and railway transportation played a greater role than in previous years.
    The 1953 railway new line construction plan was fully completed, adding another 589 kilometers of new railways to the map of the motherland. In addition, more than 400 kilometers of dedicated lines were newly built, more than 140 kilometers of double-track railways were newly built or restored. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, connecting the southwest and northwest, has been built from Chengdu to Zhongba and will soon cross the western Sichuan plain and enter the mountains. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, running through the northwest, has laid rails for more than 180 kilometers, all the way to the foot of the Wushaoling Mountains; soon after, the railway will pass through the Wushaoling Mountains and advance towards the Hexi Corridor. The construction of two forest railways for the development of forests in the northeast is also progressing rapidly. The Yalin Line leading to the Greater Khingan Mountains has been built to the timber concentration area of Tuqihe; the Tanglin Line leading to the Lesser Khingan Mountains is also extending to the forest area. Most of the new lines were still under construction in the front section, and temporary business was started in the rear section, which promptly met the needs of industrial production and basic construction. For example, after the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was built to Dachaigou and temporary business was started, the petroleum from Yumen was transferred from Dachaigou by train to the east, supplying the needs of petroleum refineries in the northeast, Shanghai and other places. After the Yalin Line was built to the two timber concentration areas of Dulumar and Tuqihe, timber from the Greater Khingan Mountains began to be shipped out in large quantities, supplying various domestic infrastructure projects. After these railways were opened to traffic section by section, they have begun to improve the lives of local people. For example, after the specialty of the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qianghuo (medicinal material), was shipped out in large quantities by train, the price increased from 1,500 yuan per catty before the opening of traffic to 4,000 yuan per catty. The tea bricks needed by local Tibetans could be exchanged for 20 pieces for 100 catties of wool before the opening of traffic, but now they can be exchanged for 40 pieces.
    The volume of transportation completed by existing railways across the country last year was greater than in previous years. In 1953, the railway car loading plan was completed by 108.3 percent, an increase of 15.7 percent over 1952; the total tonnage of goods sent was completed by 112.9 percent of the plan, an increase of 20 percent over 1952. In order to meet the needs of national construction, the railway completed the transportation of steel, wood, and mineral building materials with great effort. Compared with 1952, the transportation volume of steel increased by 41.3 percent in 1953, wood increased by 20.9 percent, and mineral building materials increased by 79.6 percent. When transporting these materials, railway workers tried their best to load more and transport faster. For example, in the transportation of wood, the workers created car loading methods such as the "pillar external support method", the "round wood pair loading method", and the "group continuous loading method", which made each car average 2.1 tons more wood than in 1952, which is equivalent to saving 35,350 operating cars throughout the year. When transporting coal, sand, stones, soil, bricks, and tiles, the workers adopted the Soviet "accumulative loading method", which can load an average of three to four tons more per car. In order to ensure the normal production and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Harbin Railway Administration also specially organized direct trains to Anshan Iron and Steel to support Anshan Iron and Steel, so that Anshan Iron and Steel could receive raw materials and equipment in a timely and continuous manner, and products could also be shipped out on time. In addition to normal transportation, the railway also undertook many urgent transportation tasks.
    Railway workers in 1953, played a great initiative, and thus in improving the static load and reducing costs, made new achievements. For example, the static load of freight cars increased by an average of one ton compared with 1952, which is equivalent to saving more than 580,000 operating cars throughout the year. Locomotive running kilometers and total traction ton kilometers have increased compared with 1952, and locomotive coal consumption has been greatly reduced. In 1953, the contact between railway workers and cargo owners was also relatively close. They took the initiative to understand and organize the source of goods, took the initiative to contact the consignment department, held cargo owner meetings, strengthened the planning of transportation, reduced counter-current transportation and roundabout transportation, and improved transportation quality. For example, the railway department found that the Shenyang Construction Engineering Company of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry of the Central People's Government transported 1,000 tons of cement from Taiyuan to Shenyang, and a certain unit in North China transported 1,000 tons of cement from Andong to the Jinghan Line. They took the initiative to contact these two units and transported the cement from Andong to Shenyang and the cement from Taiyuan to the Jinghan Line, avoiding counter-current transportation and saving cargo owners more than 300 million yuan in freight. Last year, the actual cost of the national railway was reduced by 20.86 percent compared with the plan; the railway system's annual profit delivery plan and the 41,000 billion yuan increase in production and conservation plan were overfulfilled.
    Although the above-mentioned achievements were made in railway transportation in 1953 due to the efforts of the vast number of workers, the objective needs were not fully met in the second half of the year under the conditions of increased transportation volume. In 1954, the transportation volume will increase even more. Therefore, railway transportation must exert greater efforts to meet the needs of national construction. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　去年铁路建设和运输成绩显著
    在祖国第一个五年建设计划的第一年里，铁路建设相应地有了发展，铁路运输发挥了比往年更大的作用。
    一九五三年的铁路新线建设计划全部完成了，在祖国的版图上又增加了五百八十九公里新铁路。此外还新建了四百多公里专用线，新建或恢复了一百四十多公里铁路复线，沟通西南和西北的宝成铁路已经从成都修到了中坝，不久就要越过川西平原进入山区。贯穿西北的兰新铁路已铺轨一百八十多公里，直到乌鞘岭山脚；不久以后，铁路就可穿过乌鞘岭，向着河西走廊前进。为开发东北森林而修的两条森林铁路进展也很迅速。通往大兴安岭的牙林线已经修到木材集中地图里河；通往小兴安岭的汤林线也向林区伸展。大部分新线前段还在修筑，后段就开办临时营业，及时满足了工业生产和基本建设的需要。如兰新路修到打柴沟并开办临时营业后，玉门的石油就从打柴沟转由火车源源东运，供应了东北、上海等地石油炼油厂的需要。牙林线修到都鲁玛和图里河两个木材集中地后，大兴安岭的木材开始大量外运，使国内各基本建设工程得到了供应。这些铁路逐段通车后，已开始使当地人民生活得到改善。如天祝藏族自治区的特产羌活（药材）由火车大量外运后，价格由通车前的一千五百元一斤提高到四千元一斤。当地藏民需要的茶砖，通车前一百斤羊毛换二十块，现在可以换四十块了。
    全国各地现有铁路去年完成的运输任务比往年为多。一九五三年，铁路装车计划完成百分之一百零八点三，比一九五二年提高百分之十五点七；发送货物总吨数完成计划百分之一百十二点九，比一九五二年提高百分之二十。为了适应国家建设的需要，铁路以很大的力量完成了钢铁、木材、矿物性建筑材料的运输。一九五三年与一九五二年相比，钢铁的运输量增加了百分之四十一点三，木材增加百分之二十点九，矿物性建筑材料增加百分之七十九点六。铁路职工在运输这些材料时，想尽方法多装快运。如运输木材，职工们创造了“支柱外撑法”，“圆木对装法”，“成组连装法”等装车方法，使每个车皮平均比一九五二年多装二点一吨木材，全年等于节省三万五千三百五十个运用车。在运输煤、砂石、泥土、砖瓦时，职工们采用苏联的“起积装载法”，平均每车可多装三吨到四吨。为保证鞍山钢铁公司的正常生产和建设，哈尔滨铁路管理局还专门编组直达鞍钢的列车支援鞍钢，使鞍钢能及时地源源不断地得到原料和器材，产品也能按时运出。除了正常的运输外，铁路还担任了许多紧急的运输任务。
    铁路职工在一九五三年内，发挥了很大的积极性，因而在提高静载重和降低成本等方面，取得了新的成绩。如货车静载重比一九五二年平均提高一吨，全年等于节省了五十八万多个运用车。机车运行公里和牵引总重吨公里都比一九五二年提高，机车用煤大大降低。一九五三年，铁路职工和货主的联系也比较密切，主动了解和组织货源，主动与托运部门联系，召开货主会议，加强了运输的计划性，减少了对流运输和迂回运输，并提高了运输质量。如铁路部门发现中央人民政府第一机械工业部沈阳建筑工程公司从太原运水泥一千吨到沈阳，华北某单位从安东运水泥一千吨到京汉线，他们就主动和这两个单位联系，把安东的水泥运到沈阳，把太原的运到京汉线，避免了对流运输，给货主节省运费三亿多元。去年全国铁路的实际成本比计划降低百分之二十点八六；铁路系统全年的上缴利润计划和四万一千亿元的增产节约计划都超额完成。
    虽然一九五三年由于广大职工的努力，铁路运输获得了上述的成绩，但后半年在运量增加的情况下，并未完全满足客观需要。一九五四年运量将增加更多，因此，铁路运输还须发挥更大力量，才能满足国家建设的需要。    （新华社）
