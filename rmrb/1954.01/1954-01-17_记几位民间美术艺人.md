    A Few Folk Art Craftsmen
    童横 [Tong Heng]
    During the National Folk Art and Crafts Exhibition, more than forty well-known folk art craftsmen from major administrative regions were invited to Beijing by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government for observation and study. They are all skilled craftsmen who have been diligently dedicated to folk art and craft creation for decades, and most of them are visiting the people's capital for the first time. Having been long despised and tortured in the old society, they feel particularly honored, happy, and moved today. During their ten-plus days in Beijing, in addition to observing the art and crafts from various regions and ethnic groups exhibited at the exhibition, they also visited the ancient crafts collected and displayed in the Palace Museum, the exquisite buildings at the Temple of Heaven and the Summer Palace, and the clay Buddhist statues at Dahui Temple. They also held multiple seminars to learn from each other, conduct research, and exchange creative experiences.

    Wu Longfa, a seventy-five-year-old porcelain painter, is a senior blue-and-white artist from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi. He is a rare talent who can both write and paint. However, before liberation, he was unemployed for a long time, relying on fishing and the sporadic assistance from a few nephews and a goddaughter to survive those tragic days. It was not until after liberation that he received help from the local People's Government, picked up his brush again, and continued to use his talents for the people. This old artist's dedication to study and his meticulous creation in work are admirable. He started as an apprentice at the age of thirteen, learning to paint "blue and white". However, at that time, masters generally refused to teach their skills properly to others, so Wu Longfa slowly explored and imitated the master's painting methods and observed the images of real people and objects in secret. He insisted on practicing, and after completing his apprenticeship, he tried every means to seek advice from painters. Once, in order to paint the "Eighteen Arhats", he walked to an Arhat temple dozens of miles away to observe them carefully for a long time. After returning, he painted them one by one. If there were two or three that he did not see clearly or forgot, he would go back to see them again until he was satisfied. Although the wages for painting a piece of porcelain were not high at that time, he never produced shoddy work. He was very loyal to his artistic creation. He could use only one kind of zhuming [vermilion] material to paint five different shades, which was also unmatched by others. He worked for fifty or sixty years, and even participated in the work of the Qing Dynasty "Imperial Kiln". This time, he was extremely happy to visit the porcelain in the Palace Museum. He used a pencil to draw the patterns that he considered satisfactory, preparing to take them back for research. He touched his silvery, long beard and nodded, saying, "Learn as long as you live." Judging from Wu Longfa's spirit of learning, he is not old yet.

    Zeng Longsheng, a ceramic artist from Jingdezhen who came to Beijing with Wu Longfa, is a famous porcelain sculpture artist. From the age of eleven when he became an apprentice to the age of fifty-three this year, he has had more than forty years of creative experience. He can sculpt and paint himself, and has created methods such as "kiln color combined with furnace color" (applying a good glaze and firing it in the kiln, then adding detailed parts and firing it in the furnace again) and "glazing the clothes of figures but not the faces" (to prevent the details from being covered by thick glaze and to avoid reflection). The porcelain sculptures "Lu Zhishen Uprooting the Willow Tree" and "Mother and Child Chicken" exhibited this time are his recent works. When he was in his twenties, he made a statue of Sun Yat-sen, eight feet tall, which was the largest porcelain sculpture in the history of Jingdezhen. It took him more than a year to complete. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government bought it forcibly at a low price and took away the model together, prohibiting him from re-making it. After liberation, Zeng Longsheng, like other artists, deeply felt the joy of being liberated. In 1952, he joined the Jingdezhen Ceramic Art Processing Cooperative and actively participated in model-making work for the Land Reform Exhibition, the Health Exhibition, and the Materials Exchange Conference. He was twice named a model worker. Last year, after he was transferred to the Jiangxi Provincial Art Studio, his enthusiasm became even greater. He expressed his determination to better serve the motherland and the people in the future.

    Another ceramic sculpture artist, Liu Chuan, is a famous figure sculptor from Shiwan, Guangdong. His sculptures of "Qu Yuan," "Li Bai," and "Du Fu" were all exhibited at this exhibition; in addition, he also tried to create some new figures such as "Statue of Lu Xun" and "Volunteer Soldier". Because he understands how to deeply observe the images of characters, grasp their characteristics, and study their personalities, his sculptures are generally very realistic and vivid. He does not need to find a "model" temporarily when creating, but when necessary, he often performs various poses himself to experience and ponder. He has a strong ability to learn. His early works were basically imitations of Pan Yushu, a senior artist from Shiwan. Although he had been an apprentice in pottery making for a few years since he was thirteen, he returned home at the age of nineteen. He taught himself sculpture at home and slowly produced clay figures to sell to kiln owners, supporting himself by his own labor. During the Anti-Japanese War, most of the kiln owners closed down, and pottery sculpture art suffered a disaster. Pan Yushu and Huo Jin, two highly skilled artists, died of hunger and poverty at that time. Because Liu Chuan had learned pottery making, he knew how to fire and mix glazes, so he sculpted, fired, and sold himself, and the sales were not bad. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he thought he had survived the long night and was looking forward to the dawn, but Kuomintang bureaucrats and bandits often made trouble for him. At that time, he thought: his ancestors had been poor for generations, and now that life is better, he still has to suffer, which is really too miserable. After liberation, he gradually realized that all of this was the crime of the old society and the reactionary rulers. In 1951, he joined the art department of a company and later worked in the pottery sculpture workshop of the Guangzhou People's Art Society in Shiwan. He said, "I used to work alone for many years. Now the People's Government attaches importance to and takes care of us, and there are very favorable conditions for the development of ceramic art. Why don't we work together?"

    Du Yun Song, an old woodcarving artist from Dongyang, Zhejiang, also said, "The Kuomintang government only cared about themselves in the past. Now the People's Government belongs to all of us; we have Chairman Mao and the Communist Party leading us, and we should work hard!" This seventy-year-old Du Yun Song, with his white beard fluttering on his chest and a smile on his face, is a kind, humble, and simple old man. Whenever he talks about his woodcarving work "Liang Hongyu Fighting the Jin Soldiers on the Water" at this exhibition, he always likes to say, "Not enough experience, not done well." In fact, from the age of fourteen when he started as an apprentice to the present, when he can create his own drafts after the age of twenty, he has persisted in woodcarving art for more than fifty years, and his excellent skills and achievements have long been recognized by the masses. He said that the history of Dongyang woodcarving is very long, but the woodcarvings he saw in the early Qing Dynasty were not very good. It was not until after the Qianlong period that there were gradually better works. But at that time, the artists worked all day long, and they were physically exhausted by the evening, so learning was impossible, and progress was very slow. Around 1920, the export of woodcarving crafts gradually developed, and six or seven hundred Dongyang woodcarving artists went to work in Shanghai. After the Anti-Japanese War, due to the rule and oppression of Japanese and American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, almost all the artists lost their jobs, and their lives were very difficult. Some drifted to Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places, where life was also extremely difficult. He said: Now the People's Government attaches importance to folk crafts, and every Dongyang woodcarving artist is extremely happy. He firmly believes that woodcarving crafts have a very broad future in the great construction of the motherland. Architecture needs woodcarving, and furniture, large such as folding screens and wardrobes, and small such as book clips and mirror frames, also need woodcarving. This optimistic and confident old artist has seen the rebirth of Chinese woodcarving art.

    Gong Yuzhang, a bamboo fan weaver from Zigong City, Sichuan, is also an old artist who is almost sixty years old. We saw his outstanding works in the weaving section of this exhibition. The thin, silk-like bamboo fans woven with bamboo strips as thin as silk threads, with various exquisite pictures woven on them, are truly unimaginable to be the result of relying entirely on the labor of both hands. This bamboo weaving artist was originally from Weiyuan, Sichuan. In the generation of his father, Gong Juewu, because the fields were sold out and the plowing cattle also died, the family of seven had to move to Zigong City. He was only a little over one year old at that time. His father carried coal for others, which was not enough to make a living, so he took bamboo fan weaving as a side business and carefully studied and improved it, gradually creating a bamboo fan that was much more exquisite than ordinary bamboo fans. Because of his intelligence and eagerness to learn, he was able to assist his father in his work at the age of ten. After that, through his continued research, he was not only able to weave more exquisite bamboo fans, but also to weave various figures, animals, flowers, landscapes, and seal, official, running, and cursive scripts. He can also weave hanging screens with comic strips. Because of his successful attempt to weave portraits, he is planning to weave a portrait of Chairman Mao. His creation can be said to be versatile. He not only used his spare time from farming to weave bamboo fans, but also worked as a fitter, used a lathe, and designed and tried to build a machine for weaving bamboo curtains. He has two sons, both of whom have high bamboo weaving skills. The bamboo fans exhibited this time were the result of his cooperation with his eldest son. His youngest son joined the Chinese People's Volunteers in 1950. When he mentioned this, his eyes showed unparalleled joy. He took out a photo from his pocket and pointed to a handsome young man in full Volunteer uniform—our most beloved person: "Look, in the past, in order to avoid the Kuomintang from conscripting soldiers, I tried every means to hide him; but now, I handed him over to the country without hesitation." This old artist's passionate patriotism is easy to understand. Listen to what he said himself: "In the past, I not only rented other people's land, but even the house was rented. The whole family was often not full, and we hadn't added a new piece of clothing for ten years. The monthly rent cost more than one dan [approximately 100 liters] of rice. Before liberation, the price of rice in Zigong was frighteningly high. Now the price of rice in the Zigong City Cooperative is 840 yuan per jin [approximately 500 grams], and it is convenient to buy oil, salt, and everything else. My life has improved, and my culture has also improved. I understand many things that I didn't understand before. Isn't all of this given by Chairman Mao!"

    Every artist seems to have an endless story of past pain, and also seems to have endless pleasant feelings today. Zhang Jinghu, a well-known clay sculpture artist "Clay Figure Zhang", said: "This folk art and crafts exhibition is really a good opportunity that has never happened in history. Putting the exquisite works of various regions and industries together for observation and comparison, experts and artists learn from each other, it is really great. We can no longer be as conservative as in the past. We must exchange experiences and improve in order to develop." Many artists said that after returning, they must actively take the lead in continuing to create, carry forward the excellent traditions of national art, and promote the improvement of craft production methods, encourage organization to take the road of cooperation, and produce a large number of beautiful, practical, and inexpensive crafts to meet the material and cultural needs of the broad masses of the people. This folk art and crafts exhibition and the observation and seminars of folk art craftsmen foreshadow the flourishing development prospects of folk art and crafts!

    记几位民间美术艺人
    童横
    在全国民间美术工艺品展览会展出期间，各大行政区著名的民间美术艺人，应中央人民政府文化部的邀请，有四十多人来京观摩。他们都是数十年来一贯辛勤地致力于民间美术工艺创作的能手，多数还是初次来到人民的首都。由于他们过去在旧社会里长期地被轻视、受折磨，他们今天特别感觉光荣、愉快和感动。在京十多天中，他们除观摩展览会所展出的各地和各民族的美术工艺品之外，还参观了故宫博物院收藏和陈列的古代工艺品，天坛和颐和园等处的精美建筑，以及大慧寺的泥塑大佛像等等，并且进行了多次的座谈，互相学习、研究，交流创作经验。
    七十五岁的瓷器画师吴龙发，是江西景德镇的青花老艺人，能书能画，是不可多得的人才。但在解放前他曾长期失业，靠着钓鱼和几个侄儿、一个干女儿的零星接济，艰难地度过了那些悲惨的日子，直到解放后，才获得当地人民政府的帮助，重新拿起画笔，继续为人民发挥他的才能。这位老艺人在学习上的刻苦钻研和在工作上的精心创造，是令人敬佩的。他十三岁开始当学徒，学绘“青花”，可是当时的师傅一般都不肯把本领好好传授给别人，吴龙发便自己慢慢地暗中摸索，留心仿效师傅的画法和观察真人实物的形象，坚持练习，满师之后他还想尽种种方法向画师们求教。有一次为了要绘“十八尊罗汉”，他曾步行到数十里以外的一所罗汉庙里去细看了很久，回来一个个地画出来，有两三个没有看清楚或是忘记了，就再去看一次，直到满意地完成为止。尽管那时绘一件瓷器的工资并不多，但他决不粗制滥造，他非常忠实于他的艺术创作。他能只用珠明料一种，画出五种不同浓淡的色调，也是别人所不及的。他工作了五六十年，中间并曾参加过清代“御窑”的工作。这次他参观了故宫的瓷器，异常高兴，他用铅笔画下了那些认为满意的图样，准备带回去研究，他摸摸银色的络腮长须，点点头说：“做到老，学到老。”从吴龙发学习的精神来看，他还没有老。
    和吴龙发一同来京的景德镇陶瓷艺人，曾龙升是著名的瓷雕艺人，从十一岁当学徒起，到今年五十三岁，已有四十多年的创作经历，能自塑自绘，并且创造了“窑彩兼炉彩”（上好彩釉在窑里烧成后，添绘细致部分再在炉里烧一次）和人物衣服上釉脸面不上釉（以免细部被厚釉掩盖并免反光）等方法。这次展出的瓷塑“鲁智深倒拔垂杨柳”、“母子鸡”，就是他最近的作品。他在二十几岁时，曾做过一个孙中山塑像，高八尺，是景德镇有史以来所有瓷塑中最大的一个，工作了一年多才完成，当时国民党反动政府出了低价强买了去，连模型也一起拿去，不准他再行翻制。解放后，曾龙升像其他的艺人一样，深感到翻身的喜悦。一九五二年，他参加了景德镇的陶瓷美术加工合作社，又积极参加了土地改革展览会、卫生展览会和物资交流大会等模型塑造工作，并两次被评为劳动模范。去年，他被调到江西省美术工作室工作后，劲头更大了。他表示今后决心要更好地为祖国、为人民服务。
    另一位陶瓷雕塑艺人刘传，是广东石湾专塑人物的名手。他塑造的“屈原”、“李白”、“杜甫”等人像，都在这次展览会上展出；另外，他还尝试创作了一些新的人物如“鲁迅像”和“志愿军”等。由于他懂得深刻地观察人物形象、抓住人物特征和研究人物性格，他的塑造一般地都很真实、生动。他创作时不需要临时找“模特儿”，可是必要时他也往往自己表演各种姿态来体会、揣摩。他学习的能力很强，早期的作品，基本上是模仿石湾的前辈艺人潘玉书的，他虽从十三岁开始做过几年陶器的学徒，但十九岁时就回家了，在家里自学塑造，并且慢慢有泥坯出品卖给窑商，靠自己的劳动养活自己。抗日战争中，窑商多数停业，陶塑艺术遭受了厄运，技艺很高的潘玉书、霍津二人就是在那时因饥寒贫病而死。刘传因为学过制陶，会烧、也会调釉，他就自塑自烧自卖，销路倒还不坏。抗日战争结束后，他以为熬过长夜、盼到天明了，但是国民党官僚和土匪却常常找他的麻烦。当时他想：祖上穷了几辈子，如今生活较好却又要受气，真是太命苦了。解放后，他才逐渐认识那都是旧社会和反动统治者的罪恶。一九五一年他参加了一个企业公司的美工部工作，后来又在广州人民美术社设在石湾的陶器雕塑工场工作。他说：“过去我一个人尚且干了多年，现在人民政府重视和照顾我们，发展陶瓷美术有了极有利的条件，我们还不合力好好地干吗？”
    浙江东阳木雕老艺人杜云松也这么说：“从前国民党政府只顾他们自己，现在人民政府是我们大家的；我们有毛主席、共产党领导，应当好好工作！”这位七十岁的杜云松，白胡子飘拂在胸前，脸上时时出现着笑容，是一位和蔼、谦虚和淳朴的老人。一谈到这次展览会上他的木雕作品“梁红玉水上战金兵”，他总爱说：“经验不够，作得不好。”事实上，他自十四岁从师学艺起，二十岁以后能自己出稿创作，直到今天，坚持于木雕艺术已五十多年，他的优秀的技巧和成绩，早已为群众所公认了。他说东阳木雕的历史是很久远了，不过他所见的清初的木雕，却不算怎么好的，乾隆年间以后，才渐渐有较好的作品。但那时艺人们日间整天劳动，一到晚上体力疲倦，学习就根本谈不上，所以进步很慢。约在一九二○年以后，木雕工艺的外销，逐渐发展，东阳木雕艺人到上海去工作的有六、七百人。抗日战争以后，由于日、美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的统治压迫，艺人们几乎全部失了业，生活非常困苦，有的流落到香港、新加坡等地去，生活也极艰难。他说：现在人民政府重视民间工艺，东阳木雕艺人个个高兴的了不得。他坚信木雕工艺在伟大的祖国建设中，有非常广阔的前途，建筑上需要木雕，家具大的如折屏、衣橱，小的如书夹、镜架等等，也都需要木雕。这位乐观的、满怀信心的老艺人看到了中国木雕工艺的新生。
    四川自贡市善编竹扇的龚玉璋，也是一位快到六十岁的老艺人。我们在这次展览会的编织物部分中看到了他出色的作品，那种用丝线一样细的竹篾编成的轻薄如绢的竹扇，上面还织出各种精致的图画，实在令人难于想像这是完全依靠两手的劳作。这位编竹艺人原籍四川威远，在他父亲龚爵五那一辈，因为卖光了田地，耕牛也病死了，只得一家七口迁到了自贡市。那时他才一岁多，他父亲给人家挑煤炭，不够糊口，便以编竹扇为副业，并细心研究、改进，逐渐创造了比普通竹扇要精巧得多的一种竹扇。由于他的聪明好学，十岁左右便能协助父亲工作，以后又经他继续研究，不但能编出更精巧的竹扇，而且能编出各种人物、动物、花卉、风景和篆、隶、行、草等字体，还能编连环图画的挂屏。因为他尝试编织人像的成功，正计划好好编一个毛主席的像。他的创造真可说是多才多艺的，他不仅利用农闲来编织竹扇，并曾做过钳工，使过车床，并曾设计试造过一架编织竹帘的机器。他有两个儿子，都有很高的编竹技艺，这次展出的竹扇，便是他和他的大儿子合作的。小儿子在一九五○年参加了中国人民志愿军，他提到这，两眼露出无上愉快的光芒，从口袋里掏出一张像片来，指着上面一位全副志愿军服装的英俊少年——我们最可爱的人：“瞧，解放前为了躲避国民党抓壮丁，我想尽方法把他藏来藏去；但是现在，我毫不犹豫地把他交给了国家。”这位老艺人热烈的爱国心情，是容易理解的，你听他自己怎么说的：“过去我不但租种别人的地，连房子也是租来的。全家经常吃不饱，十年没有添过一件新衣。每月房租要一担多米，解放前自贡的米价是高得骇人的，现在自贡市合作社里的米八百四十元一斤，买油买盐买什么也都方便。我生活提高了，文化也提高了，以前不懂的事现在也懂得多了。这不全都是毛主席给的吗！”
    每一位艺人都有似乎诉不尽的过去的痛苦经历，也有似乎谈不完的今天的愉快心情。远近闻名的泥塑艺人“泥人张”张景祜说：“这次的民间美术工艺品展览，真是历史上从来不曾有过的好机会，把各地各业的精采作品摆在一起观摩、比较，专家和艺人互相学习，真是太好了。我们不能再像过去似的保守，要交流经验，要改进，才能发展”。许多艺人都表示回去以后一定要积极带头地继续创作，发扬民族美术的优秀传统，并且要推动工艺品生产方式的改进，鼓励组织起来走合作化的道路，生产大量的美观、实用、价格低廉的工艺品，以满足广大人民物质和文化生活的需要。这次民间美术工艺品的展览和民间美术艺人的观摩、座谈，预示了民间美术工艺的百花齐放的发展前途！
