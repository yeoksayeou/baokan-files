    A Few Folk Art Craftsmen
    члецик [Tong Heng]
    During the National Folk Art and Crafts Exhibition, more than forty well-known folk art craftsmen from major administrative regions were invited to Beijing by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government for observation and study. They are all skilled craftsmen who have been diligently dedicated to folk art and craft creation for decades, and most of them are visiting the people's capital for the first time. Having been long despised and tortured in the old society, they feel particularly honored, happy, and moved today. During their ten-plus days in Beijing, in addition to observing the art and crafts from various regions and ethnic groups exhibited at the exhibition, they also visited the ancient crafts collected and displayed in the Palace Museum, the exquisite buildings at the Temple of Heaven and the Summer Palace, and the clay Buddhist statues at Dahui Temple. They also held multiple seminars to learn from each other, conduct research, and exchange creative experiences.

    Wu Longfa, a seventy-five-year-old porcelain painter, is a senior blue-and-white artist from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi. He is a rare talent who can both write and paint. However, before liberation, he was unemployed for a long time, relying on fishing and the sporadic assistance from a few nephews and a goddaughter to survive those tragic days. It was not until after liberation that he received help from the local People's Government, picked up his brush again, and continued to use his talents for the people. This old artist's dedication to study and his meticulous creation in work are admirable. He started as an apprentice at the age of thirteen, learning to paint "blue and white". However, at that time, masters generally refused to teach their skills properly to others, so Wu Longfa slowly explored and imitated the master's painting methods and observed the images of real people and objects in secret. He insisted on practicing, and after completing his apprenticeship, he tried every means to seek advice from painters. Once, in order to paint the "Eighteen Arhats", he walked to an Arhat temple dozens of miles away to observe them carefully for a long time. After returning, he painted them one by one. If there were two or three that he did not see clearly or forgot, he would go back to see them again until he was satisfied. Although the wages for painting a piece of porcelain were not high at that time, he never produced shoddy work. He was very loyal to his artistic creation. He could use only one kind of zhuming [vermilion] material to paint five different shades, which was also unmatched by others. He worked for fifty or sixty years, and even participated in the work of the Qing Dynasty "Imperial Kiln". This time, he was extremely happy to visit the porcelain in the Palace Museum. He used a pencil to draw the patterns that he considered satisfactory, preparing to take them back for research. He touched his silvery, long beard and nodded, saying, "Learn as long as you live." Judging from Wu Longfa's spirit of learning, he is not old yet.

    Zeng Longsheng, a ceramic artist from Jingdezhen who came to Beijing with Wu Longfa, is a famous porcelain sculpture artist. From the age of eleven when he became an apprentice to the age of fifty-three this year, he has had more than forty years of creative experience. He can sculpt and paint himself, and has created methods such as "kiln color combined with furnace color" (applying a good glaze and firing it in the kiln, then adding detailed parts and firing it in the furnace again) and "glazing the clothes of figures but not the faces" (to prevent the details from being covered by thick glaze and to avoid reflection). The porcelain sculptures "Lu Zhishen Uprooting the Willow Tree" and "Mother and Child Chicken" exhibited this time are his recent works. When he was in his twenties, he made a statue of Sun Yat-sen, eight feet tall, which was the largest porcelain sculpture in the history of Jingdezhen. It took him more than a year to complete. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government bought it forcibly at a low price and took away the model together, prohibiting him from re-making it. After liberation, Zeng Longsheng, like other artists, deeply felt the joy of being liberated. In 1952, he joined the Jingdezhen Ceramic Art Processing Cooperative and actively participated in model-making work for the Land Reform Exhibition, the Health Exhibition, and the Materials Exchange Conference. He was twice named a model worker. Last year, after he was transferred to the Jiangxi Provincial Art Studio, his enthusiasm became even greater. He expressed his determination to better serve the motherland and the people in the future.

    Another ceramic sculpture artist, Liu Chuan, is a famous figure sculptor from Shiwan, Guangdong. His sculptures of "Qu Yuan," "Li Bai," and "Du Fu" were all exhibited at this exhibition; in addition, he also tried to create some new figures such as "Statue of Lu Xun" and "Volunteer Soldier". Because he understands how to deeply observe the images of characters, grasp their characteristics, and study their personalities, his sculptures are generally very realistic and vivid. He does not need to find a "model" temporarily when creating, but when necessary, he often performs various poses himself to experience and ponder. He has a strong ability to learn. His early works were basically imitations of Pan Yushu, a senior artist from Shiwan. Although he had been an apprentice in pottery making for a few years since he was thirteen, he returned home at the age of nineteen. He taught himself sculpture at home and slowly produced clay figures to sell to kiln owners, supporting himself by his own labor. During the Anti-Japanese War, most of the kiln owners closed down, and pottery sculpture art suffered a disaster. Pan Yushu and Huo Jin, two highly skilled artists, died of hunger and poverty at that time. Because Liu Chuan had learned pottery making, he knew how to fire and mix glazes, so he sculpted, fired, and sold himself, and the sales were not bad. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he thought he had survived the long night and was looking forward to the dawn, but Kuomintang bureaucrats and bandits often made trouble for him. At that time, he thought: his ancestors had been poor for generations, and now that life is better, he still has to suffer, which is really too miserable. After liberation, he gradually realized that all of this was the crime of the old society and the reactionary rulers. In 1951, he joined the art department of a company and later worked in the pottery sculpture workshop of the Guangzhou People's Art Society in Shiwan. He said, "I used to work alone for many years. Now the People's Government attaches importance to and takes care of us, and there are very favorable conditions for the development of ceramic art. Why don't we work together?"

    Du Yun Song, an old woodcarving artist from Dongyang, Zhejiang, also said, "The Kuomintang government only cared about themselves in the past. Now the People's Government belongs to all of us; we have Chairman Mao and the Communist Party leading us, and we should work hard!" This seventy-year-old Du Yun Song, with his white beard fluttering on his chest and a smile on his face, is a kind, humble, and simple old man. Whenever he talks about his woodcarving work "Liang Hongyu Fighting the Jin Soldiers on the Water" at this exhibition, he always likes to say, "Not enough experience, not done well." In fact, from the age of fourteen when he started as an apprentice to the present, when he can create his own drafts after the age of twenty, he has persisted in woodcarving art for more than fifty years, and his excellent skills and achievements have long been recognized by the masses. He said that the history of Dongyang woodcarving is very long, but the woodcarvings he saw in the early Qing Dynasty were not very good. It was not until after the Qianlong period that there were gradually better works. But at that time, the artists worked all day long, and they were physically exhausted by the evening, so learning was impossible, and progress was very slow. Around 1920, the export of woodcarving crafts gradually developed, and six or seven hundred Dongyang woodcarving artists went to work in Shanghai. After the Anti-Japanese War, due to the rule and oppression of Japanese and American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, almost all the artists lost their jobs, and their lives were very difficult. Some drifted to Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places, where life was also extremely difficult. He said: Now the People's Government attaches importance to folk crafts, and every Dongyang woodcarving artist is extremely happy. He firmly believes that woodcarving crafts have a very broad future in the great construction of the motherland. Architecture needs woodcarving, and furniture, large such as folding screens and wardrobes, and small such as book clips and mirror frames, also need woodcarving. This optimistic and confident old artist has seen the rebirth of Chinese woodcarving art.

    Gong Yuzhang, a bamboo fan weaver from Zigong City, Sichuan, is also an old artist who is almost sixty years old. We saw his outstanding works in the weaving section of this exhibition. The thin, silk-like bamboo fans woven with bamboo strips as thin as silk threads, with various exquisite pictures woven on them, are truly unimaginable to be the result of relying entirely on the labor of both hands. This bamboo weaving artist was originally from Weiyuan, Sichuan. In the generation of his father, Gong Juewu, because the fields were sold out and the plowing cattle also died, the family of seven had to move to Zigong City. He was only a little over one year old at that time. His father carried coal for others, which was not enough to make a living, so he took bamboo fan weaving as a side business and carefully studied and improved it, gradually creating a bamboo fan that was much more exquisite than ordinary bamboo fans. Because of his intelligence and eagerness to learn, he was able to assist his father in his work at the age of ten. After that, through his continued research, he was not only able to weave more exquisite bamboo fans, but also to weave various figures, animals, flowers, landscapes, and seal, official, running, and cursive scripts. He can also weave hanging screens with comic strips. Because of his successful attempt to weave portraits, he is planning to weave a portrait of Chairman Mao. His creation can be said to be versatile. He not only used his spare time from farming to weave bamboo fans, but also worked as a fitter, used a lathe, and designed and tried to build a machine for weaving bamboo curtains. He has two sons, both of whom have high bamboo weaving skills. The bamboo fans exhibited this time were the result of his cooperation with his eldest son. His youngest son joined the Chinese People's Volunteers in 1950. When he mentioned this, his eyes showed unparalleled joy. He took out a photo from his pocket and pointed to a handsome young man in full Volunteer uniformтАФour most beloved person: "Look, in the past, in order to avoid the Kuomintang from conscripting soldiers, I tried every means to hide him; but now, I handed him over to the country without hesitation." This old artist's passionate patriotism is easy to understand. Listen to what he said himself: "In the past, I not only rented other people's land, but even the house was rented. The whole family was often not full, and we hadn't added a new piece of clothing for ten years. The monthly rent cost more than one dan [approximately 100 liters] of rice. Before liberation, the price of rice in Zigong was frighteningly high. Now the price of rice in the Zigong City Cooperative is 840 yuan per jin [approximately 500 grams], and it is convenient to buy oil, salt, and everything else. My life has improved, and my culture has also improved. I understand many things that I didn't understand before. Isn't all of this given by Chairman Mao!"

    Every artist seems to have an endless story of past pain, and also seems to have endless pleasant feelings today. Zhang Jinghu, a well-known clay sculpture artist "Clay Figure Zhang", said: "This folk art and crafts exhibition is really a good opportunity that has never happened in history. Putting the exquisite works of various regions and industries together for observation and comparison, experts and artists learn from each other, it is really great. We can no longer be as conservative as in the past. We must exchange experiences and improve in order to develop." Many artists said that after returning, they must actively take the lead in continuing to create, carry forward the excellent traditions of national art, and promote the improvement of craft production methods, encourage organization to take the road of cooperation, and produce a large number of beautiful, practical, and inexpensive crafts to meet the material and cultural needs of the broad masses of the people. This folk art and crafts exhibition and the observation and seminars of folk art craftsmen foreshadow the flourishing development prospects of folk art and crafts!
