    The People's Governments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province, in order to improve agricultural production technology and increase yields, have provided large loans of new-style farm tools to agricultural production cooperatives and agricultural production mutual aid teams in various regions. Inner Mongolia loaned a total of more than 8,680 pieces of equipment in 1953, including seeders, cultivators, harvesters, and waterwheels. Suiyuan Province loaned 2,165 walking plows from 1950 to 1953. The mutual aid teams and production cooperatives that used new-style farm tools generally increased their yields by about 10% in 1953. The An Haiqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kailu County, Inner Mongolia, used two waterwheels loaned by the government to irrigate in a timely manner, and harvested more than 5,000 jin of wheat from 15 mu of wheat land, as well as more than 50,000 jin of Chinese cabbage. Last year, the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Left Wing Middle Banner of Horqin used horse-drawn farm implements instead of wooden plows and improved its technology. The average yield per hectare (15 mu) reached 4,620 jin, nearly doubling the previous yield. In Zhuozi County, Suiyuan Province, the wheat fields of the Jia Kao Mutual Aid Team averaged 588 jin per mu because they not only conserved moisture and applied fertilizer, but also used new-style walking plows for cultivation, which was more than 300 jin per mu more than the local farmers with equivalent paddy fields.
    New-style farm tools have reduced field labor and are therefore widely welcomed. During summer hoeing, the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Former Banner of the Right Wing of Horqin used a combined cultivator to hoe 28 hectares, averaging only one labor and one cattle labor per hectare. If manual hoeing were used, one hectare would require four to four and a half labors. Therefore, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various regions have requested that the government continue to loan new-style farm tools. In the Taipingchuan Nutuk (district) of Butha Banner, some mutual aid teams have even agreed with the government to purchase cultivators.
    The gradual promotion of new-style farm tools has promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Because the organized peasants use manpower, animal power, and land in a unified way, new-style farm tools can exert greater efficiency. For example, the Sun Yongquan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Molidawa Banner used a ten-row seeder for planting last year, requiring two people and four horses every day, while another person operated a roller with two horses to roll immediately after sowing. During summer hoeing, three combined cultivators were used, requiring three people and nine horses. Now, many individual farmers in various regions have realized that only by using new-style farm tools and improving cultivation techniques can they greatly increase production, and they have requested to be organized. Many mutual aid teams are also actively preparing to transition into agricultural production cooperatives with centralized land use.

    蒙绥地区贷放大批新式农具
    帮助农业生产互助合作组织提高生产
    内蒙古自治区和绥远省人民政府为了改进农业生产技术，提高产量，曾经贷放了大批新式农具给各地农业生产合作社和农业生产互助组使用。内蒙古一九五三年贷放了播种机、铲趟机、收割机及水车等共八千六百八十多件，绥远省从一九五零年到一九五三年共贷放了二千一百六十五台步犁。使用新式农具的互助组和生产合作社，在一九五三年一般都提高产量百分之十左右。内蒙古开鲁县安海清农业生产合作社，用政府贷给的两台水车适时浇水，十五市亩麦地收了五千多斤小麦，另外还有五万多斤大白菜。科尔沁左翼中旗前进农业生产合作社去年使用马拉农具代替木犁，改进了技术，每垧地（十五市亩）平均产量达到四千六百二十斤，超过过去的产量将近一倍。绥远省卓资县贾考互助组的麦田因为除了保墒、施肥，并使用新式步犁耕作，每亩平均收了五百八十八斤，比当地同等水田的农户，每亩多收三百多斤。
    新式农具减轻了田间劳动，所以受到了普遍的欢迎。科尔沁右翼前旗红旗农业生产合作社夏锄时用综合号铲趟机铲地二十八垧，平均每垧地只用一个人工及一个牛工，如果以人力铲地，一垧地要四个工到四个半工。因此，各地农业生产合作社及互助组，都请求政府继续贷放新式农具，在布特哈旗太平川努图克（区），有些互助组并向政府约定购置铲趟机。
    新式农具的逐步推广，推动了互助合作运动的开展。因为组织起来的农民人力、畜力和土地统一使用，可以使新式农具发挥更大效能。例如莫力达瓦旗孙永泉农业生产合作社去年种地用十行播种机播种，每天需两个人、四匹马，同时由一个人带两匹马操纵镇压器，随播随轧；夏锄时使用三台综合号铲趟机，需三个人、九匹马。现在，各地许多单干农民认识到只有使用新式农具、改进耕作技术才能大量增产，纷纷要求组织起来，许多互助组也正积极准备转为土地集中使用的农业生产合作社。
