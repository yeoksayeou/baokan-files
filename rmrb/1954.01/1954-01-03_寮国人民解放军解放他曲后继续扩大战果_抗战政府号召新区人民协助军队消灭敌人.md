Xinhua News Agency, Vientiane, Laos, February 2nd: A communique from Vietnam News Agency, Laos, dated January 1st, says that the Lao People's Liberation Army continues to advance north and south of Thakhek, and has liberated the areas north of Thakhek and the tin mining areas of Phong Tieu and Bo Neng.

The French colonialists had established many important strongholds on Highway 8 north of Thakhek, the capital of Khammouane Province, such as Kham Keut, Le Sao, and Na Phi near the Vietnamese-Laotian border. In the past, enemy troops often launched southward attacks from Na Phi against the Vietnamese liberated areas of Huong Son district in Ha Tinh province, central Vietnam.

However, since the French colonialists suffered a disastrous defeat in the Thakhek area, they have had to withdraw their troops from Kham Keut, Le Sao, and Na Phi. Now, the Lao People's Liberation Army is pursuing the fleeing enemy north of Le Sao. Thus far, the vast area 120 kilometers north of Thakhek, the capital of Khammouane Province, has been liberated.

On December 26, 1953, the Lao People's Liberation Army entered Phong Tieu and Bo Neng, 70 kilometers north of Thakhek, which are two important tin mines operated by the French colonialists. The mine owners had already fled two or three days earlier. More than 400 Laotian and Vietnamese miners joyfully welcomed the victorious people's army.

In the area south of Thakhek, between Highway 12 and the Bin Phay and Se Nay rivers, the remaining enemies have been completely eliminated. Thus far, the liberated area has expanded to near Highway 9, 80 kilometers south of Thakhek.

The enemy is now dispatching more mobile units to support the garrisons of Savannakhet and Seno airfield. On the other hand, they are sending many reinforcements from Dong Ha and Quang Tri in central Vietnam to Lao Bao in Quang Tri province.

Xinhua News Agency, Vientiane, Laos, December 31, 1953: The Lao Resistance Government issued a letter to the Lao people on December 26, 1953, stating:

The Lao Resistance Government excitedly announces to the people of Laos in all areas: The Lao People's Liberation Army has launched a large-scale offensive in Khammouane Province, annihilating a total of 2,200 enemy troops and seizing a large number of light and heavy weapons and transport vehicles. The Lao People's Liberation Army also liberated Thakhek City, the capital of Khammouane Province, on the night of December 25th.

The liberation of Khammouane Province is a major military victory. We have eliminated a large number of enemy effectives, liberated the compatriots in Thakhek, and established a vast resistance base in central Laos. At the same time, the liberation of Khammouane Province is also a major political victory. This victory has inspired the Lao army and people, further strengthening their confidence in winning the final victory, and this is a heavy blow to the French colonialists and the Lao puppets.

The government calls on compatriots in the newly liberated areas to actively assist the army in eliminating and persuading the remaining enemies to surrender; calls on them to actively participate in the Lao People's Liberation Army and guerrillas, strengthen the people's forces, protect the people's lives and property, defend the motherland, and smash all new enemy conspiracies.

Khammouane Province is located on the border with Thailand. The government calls on the Lao people to maintain friendly relations with their neighbors, the Thai people.

In April 1953, San Neua Province was liberated, and in December, Khammouane Province was also liberated. These victories powerfully prove that the Lao people's long-term and arduous resistance will surely be victorious.

    寮国人民解放军解放他曲后继续扩大战果
    抗战政府号召新区人民协助军队消灭敌人
    【新华社二日讯】据越南通讯社寮国一日讯：今天的公报说，寮国人民解放军继续向他曲以北和以南发展，并已解放他曲以北地区和逢蒂乌和波年的锡矿区。
    法国殖民者在甘蒙省会他曲以北的第八号公路上建立了许多重要据点，如甘结、勒骚和越、寮边界附近的那比。过去，敌军常从那比向南袭击越南中部河静省香山地区的越南解放区。
    但是，自从法国殖民者在他曲地区遭到惨败后，他们就不得不把军队从甘结、勒骚和那比撤出。现在，寮国人民解放军正在勒骚以北追击逃敌。至此，甘蒙省省会他曲以北一百二十公里的广大地区都已解放了。
    一九五三年十二月二十六日，寮国人民解放军进入了他曲以北七十公里的逢蒂乌和波年，这是法国殖民者所经营的两个重要的锡矿。矿主已经在两、三天以前逃跑了。四百多名寮国和越南籍的矿工欢欣鼓舞地迎接胜利的人民军队。
    在他曲以南的第十二号公路和宾非河与色乃河流域之间的地区，残敌已被全部肃清。至此，解放区已扩大到他曲以南八十公里的第九号公路附近。
    敌军现在正派遣更多的机动部队去支援沙湾拿吉和塞诺飞机场的守军。另一方面，又从越南中部的广治和东河派遣许多援军到广治省的辽保去。
    【新华社二日讯】据越南通讯社寮国一九五三年十二月三十一日讯：寮国抗战政府于一九五三年十二月二十六日发表告寮国人民书说：
    寮国抗战政府兴奋地通告寮国各地人民：寮国人民解放军在甘蒙省发动了一个大规模的攻势，总共歼灭敌军二千二百名，缴获了大批轻重武器与运输车辆。寮国人民解放军并在十二月二十五日晚上，解放了甘蒙省省会——他曲城。
    甘蒙省的解放是一个重大的军事胜利，我们大批地消灭了敌军有生力量，解放了他曲的同胞，在寮国中部建立了一个广大的抗战基地；同时甘蒙省的解放也是一个重大的政治胜利，这个胜利鼓舞了寮国军民，更为加强了他们争取最后胜利的信心，这对法国殖民者及寮国傀儡是一个沉重的打击。
    政府号召新解放地区的同胞积极协助军队消灭和招降残余的敌人；号召积极参加寮国人民解放军和游击队，加强人民的力量，保护人民的生命、财产，保卫祖国并粉碎敌人的一切新阴谋。
    甘蒙省位于泰国边境。政府号召寮国人民与邻居——泰国人民维持友好关系。
    一九五三年四月，解放了桑怒省，十二月又解放了甘蒙省。这些胜利有力地证明寮国人民的长期艰苦的抗战必将得到胜利。
