Since the liaison secretaries meeting was held on January 14th, based on our proposal, to discuss the date for resuming the bilateral talks, no progress has been made due to the U.S. side's delay, making the convocation of the political conference still distant. This situation is completely intolerable. Especially under the current serious situation in Korea caused by the U.S. side's seizure of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the peace-loving people and countries of the world are even more urgently demanding that the political conference must be convened quickly and should not continue to be obstructed.

In order to immediately resume the bilateral talks to quickly arrange the convening of the political conference, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Ki Sok-bok, and the representative of the People's Republic of China, Huang Hua, sent a letter to the U.S. representative, Dean, on January 26th, proposing that the bilateral talks resume on February 1st, 1954, in Panmunjom. This is another effort made by the Korean and Chinese sides to promote the rapid convening of the political conference. This proposal of our side is completely reasonable, and if the U.S. side still has sincerity in resuming the bilateral talks, there is no reason to refuse it.

The Korean and Chinese sides have made unremitting efforts to break the U.S. side's various obstructions and promote the rapid convening of the political conference. This is a fact that is obvious to all. As early as the 7th and 8th sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, when the issue of the political conference was discussed, the governments of China and North Korea repeatedly suggested that the United Nations General Assembly should, in accordance with the tasks of the political conference stipulated in Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement, take steps as soon as possible to expand the membership of the political conference so that the conference could be convened quickly. However, the United Nations violated the principles of the Charter and succumbed to the will of the U.S. government, refusing to accept our reasonable suggestions. In this way, the convening of the political conference was obstructed from the very beginning after the armistice. It was only due to our efforts and the pressure of fair world opinion that the U.S. side had to hold bilateral talks with us to negotiate the issues of the membership, time, and place of the political conference. In the more than one month of bilateral talks, our representatives repeatedly put forward reasonable suggestions in order to narrow the differences between the two sides and reach an agreement. Until the U.S. side fabricated unreasonable excuses and interrupted the bilateral talks, our representatives Ki Sok-bok and Huang Hua still stated on December 14th, 1953: "The Korean and Chinese sides advocate continuing the bilateral talks." On January 9th and 10th, 1954, the governments of China and North Korea issued statements one after another, advocating the immediate resumption of the bilateral talks to quickly arrange the convening of the political conference. On January 11th, our representatives Ki Sok-bok and Huang Hua sent another letter to the U.S. side, suggesting that the liaison secretaries of both sides meet to discuss and determine the date for the resumption of the talks. The liaison secretaries meeting was held on the basis of this suggestion of our side. The various efforts of the governments of China and North Korea have long won the warm sympathy and unanimous support of fair world opinion. Even a reporter for the American "Christian Science Monitor" had to admit: The Chinese and North Korean sides "provided concrete evidence in the past bilateral talks to prove that they are eager for a peaceful conference (referring to the political conference) to be convened quickly on a reasonable basis." An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on January 9th also reported that the statement issued by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on January 9th "shows that Communist China deeply hopes to resume the Panmunjom negotiations to arrange the Korean political conference."

However, disregarding our efforts and the peaceful wishes of the people of all countries, the U.S. side has always adopted a policy of obstruction and delay towards the convening of the Korean political conference. After manipulating the United Nations General Assembly and refusing to discuss the reasonable suggestions of the governments of China and North Korea, obstructing the convening of the political conference, it also used shameful means of various insults, slanders, intimidation, and unreasonable demands in the bilateral talks on the political conference issue to carry out long-term delays. On December 12th, 1953, in order to cooperate with its crime of illegally detaining prisoners of war and maintain the tense situation in Korea and internationally, the U.S. side even deliberately provoked and interrupted the bilateral talks. The U.S. representative, Dean, also said to the representatives of the countries that sent troops to invade Korea that the United States did not want to resume talks before January 22nd, which fully proved the shameful purpose of the U.S. side's unreasonable interruption of the bilateral talks.

After the liaison secretaries meeting began on January 14th due to our efforts to determine the date for resuming the bilateral talks, the U.S. side still adopted unreasonable delaying tactics, insisting on holding an administrative meeting to "examine and correct" the past meeting records as a "condition" for resuming the talks, in order to re-ignite the disputes between the two sides and obstruct the resumption of the bilateral talks. The intention of the U.S. side in doing so is clearly an attempt to deceive world public opinion, so that people cannot see the U.S. side's delaying tactics. These are obviously unacceptable to the Korean and Chinese sides. Everyone knows that the statements made by our representatives in the past bilateral talks were completely in accordance with the facts and were reasonable, and there is no need to "revise" them at all. Moreover, the two sides in the past negotiations have always kept their own records of the meetings, there are no joint records, and there is no need to "examine" these records and change them into joint records. Since the bilateral talks were unreasonably interrupted by the U.S. side itself, the U.S. representative should unconditionally return to Panmunjom to continue negotiations and quickly determine the date for the resumption of the bilateral talks. Isn't this a clear matter?

Facts have proved that the U.S. side used to delay the bilateral talks to obstruct the convening of the political conference, and now it is attempting to use the delay of the liaison secretaries meeting to obstruct the resumption of the bilateral talks, causing the liaison secretaries meeting to essentially come to a standstill, which fully demonstrates that the U.S. side still lacks sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue. An internal report from the International News Service on January 21st said that senior diplomatic personnel and military leaders of the United Nations forces "unanimously believe" that after the U.S. side forcibly detained more than 22,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, it was "equivalent to hammering the last nail into the coffin," and the hope of resuming bilateral talks was "shattered." They "believe that the Korean issue will never be resolved through negotiations, and this issue will be one of the issues in the world that will never be resolved." On January 22nd, the United Press also said that U.S. "observers believe that the negotiations on arranging the political conference may continue for a very long time."

However, while desperately obstructing the resumption of bilateral talks, the U.S. side deliberately spread optimistic air, attempting to make people think that the liaison secretaries meeting is "hopeful" of reaching an agreement. This kind of propaganda is a trick. The U.S. side is attempting to deceive the eyes and ears of the people of the world to cover up its conspiracy to obstruct the convening of the political conference, and at the same time, it is using this to continue to obstruct the resumption of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Korean issue, and wants to prevent the Four Foreign Ministers Conference from leading to a Five-Power Conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China. Lodge, the representative of the United States in the United Nations, once clamored: "It would be unwise and harmful to discuss the same issue at the same time by different conferences." This argument is obviously to create an excuse for the U.S. attempt to both obstruct the convening of the political conference and oppose other important international conferences discussing the Korean issue.

Now, all international figures who are willing to see the serious situation in Korea eased and further seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue believe that the immediate and unconditional resumption of bilateral talks to promote the rapid convening of the political conference is of great and urgent significance. This is because the goal stipulated in the Armistice Agreement is not only to achieve and maintain a military armistice, but also to convene a political conference to deal with the issue of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation, and to further seek the solution of issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, so as to consolidate peace in the Far East and the world. However, while completely destroying the "scope of authority," the U.S. side is also doing its best to obstruct the convening of the political conference, so that the full implementation of the Armistice Agreement and the consolidation of peace in Korea are being threatened more and more seriously. If we continue to allow the U.S. side's long-term obstruction, making the convening of the political conference farther and farther away, it will only be beneficial to the U.S. ruling group to do its best to maintain the tense situation in Korea and internationally, and will not be conducive to consolidating the peace and security of the Far East and all countries in the world.

Therefore, the proposal of the Korean and Chinese representatives, Ki Sok-bok and Huang Hua, that the bilateral talks be resumed on February 1st in Panmunjom, is completely in line with the peaceful wishes of the people of all countries in the world. It is unreasonable for the U.S. side to insist on its unreasonable demands and continue to implement a delaying policy in the liaison secretaries meeting. Now the test of the U.S. side's sincerity has become so simple: the U.S. side should immediately determine the date for resuming the bilateral talks with our side. If it does not agree to the resumption of the bilateral talks on February 1st, it should propose the date it deems appropriate, and our representatives have expressed their willingness to give it careful consideration in the spirit of consistent consultation. This issue cannot be delayed any longer.

### 双方会谈应即定期复会

　　双方会谈应即定期复会
    根据我方建议于一月十四日举行双方联络秘书会议，商定恢复双方会谈的日期以来，由于美方的拖延，迄无任何进展，使政治会议的召开依然遥遥无期。这一情况是完全不能令人容忍的。特别是在目前美方劫夺朝中战俘所造成的朝鲜严重局势下，全世界爱好和平的人民和国家都更加迫切地要求政治会议必须迅速召开而不应继续遭受阻挠。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福和中华人民共和国代表黄华，为了使双方会谈立即恢复来迅速安排政治会议的召开，在一月二十六日致函美方代表迪安，提议双方会谈定于一九五四年二月一日在板门店复会。这是朝中方面对促成政治会议的迅速召开所作的又一努力。我方这一提议是完全合理的，美方如对恢复双方会谈尚有诚意，就没有任何理由加以拒绝。
    朝中方面为打破美方的种种阻挠，促成政治会议的迅速召开，曾作了不懈的努力。这是有目共睹的事实。早在第七、第八两届联合国大会讨论政治会议问题时，中朝两国政府就一再建议联合国大会应根据停战协定第六十款所规定的政治会议的任务，尽速采取步骤来扩大政治会议的成员，使这个会议得以迅速召开。但联合国却违背宪章的原则，屈从美国政府的意旨，拒绝接受我方合理建议。这样，就使政治会议的召开，从停战后一开始就受到了阻挠。仅仅是由于我方的努力和世界公正舆论的压力，美方才不得不与我方举行双方会谈，来协商解决政治会议的成员、时间与地点问题。在一个多月的双方会谈中，我方代表又曾为缩小双方的各项分歧，屡次提出合理建议，以求达成协议。直到美方制造毫无道理的借口，中断了双方会谈后，我方代表奇石福、黄华仍于一九五三年十二月十四日声明：“朝中方面是主张继续双方会谈的。”一九五四年一月九日及十日，中朝两国政府先后发表了声明，主张立即恢复双方会谈，来迅速安排政治会议的召开。一月十一日我方代表奇石福、黄华又致函美方，建议双方联络秘书会晤来商定复会日期。双方联络秘书会议即是在我方这一建议的基础上举行的。中朝两国政府的种种努力，早就博得了世界公正舆论的热烈同情和一致支持。连美国“基督教科学箴言报”记者也不得不承认：中朝方面在过去双方会谈中“提供了具体的证据，证明它们渴望和平会议（指政治会议）在合理的基础上迅速召开”。法新社华盛顿一月九日电讯也报道说：我国周恩来外长一月九日发表的声明，“表示出共产党中国深切希望恢复安排朝鲜政治会议的板门店谈判的迹象”。
    但是，美方竟不顾我方的努力和世界各国人民的和平愿望，对于朝鲜政治会议的召开一直采取阻挠和拖延政策。美国在操纵联合国大会，拒绝讨论中朝两国政府的合理建议，阻挠了政治会议的召开后，又在关于政治会议问题的双方会谈中，以种种谩骂、诽谤、恫吓以及无理取闹的可耻手段，进行了长期拖延。一九五三年十二月十二日，美方为了配合其非法扣留战俘的罪行，和维持朝鲜及国际紧张局势，更蓄意寻衅地中断了双方会谈。美方代表迪安也对出兵侵朝的国家的代表们说过，美国不希望在一月二十二日以前恢复会谈，这就完全证明了美方无理中断双方会谈的可耻目的。
    在我方的努力下于一月十四日开始举行双方联络秘书会议，以商定恢复双方会谈的日期后，美方仍然采取无理拖延的手段，竟然坚持要举行行政性会议以“检查和改正”过去的会谈记录来作为恢复会谈的“条件”，以便重新引起双方的争论，阻挠双方会谈的恢复。美方这样做的用意显然是企图借此蒙蔽世界舆论，使人们看不到美方的拖延手段。这都显然是朝中方面所不能同意的。谁都知道，我方代表在过去双方会谈中的发言都完全符合事实，并且是合理的，根本无须加以“修改”。而且，过去谈判双方一直都是各自保存会议的记录，并没有共同的记录，也没有必要对这些记录进行“检查”并改为共同记录。双方会谈既然是美方自己所无理中断的，因此，美方代表就应无条件地回到板门店来继续协商，迅速确定恢复双方会谈的日期。这不是明明白白的事吗？
    事实证明，美方曾利用拖延双方会谈来阻挠政治会议的召开，现在又企图利用拖延双方联络秘书会议来阻挠双方会谈的恢复，使双方联络秘书会议实质上陷于停顿，这充分表现了美方对和平解决朝鲜问题仍然缺乏诚意。一月二十一日国际新闻社内部通报说，联合国军高级外交人员和军事领袖“一致认为”，在美方强迫扣留二万二千余朝中战俘以后，“等于在棺材上敲进最后一颗钉子”，恢复双方会谈的希望是“破灭”了。他们“认定朝鲜问题是永不会通过谈判求得解决的，这个问题将是世界上永远得不到解决的问题中的一个”。一月二十二日合众社又说，美方“观察家认为，关于安排政治会议的谈判可能要继续一个很长的时间”。
      但是美方一边拚命阻挠双方会谈的恢复，一边却又故意散放乐观空气，企图使人以为双方联络秘书会议是“有希望”达成协议的。这种宣传是一个诡计。美方企图蒙蔽世界人民的耳目，以掩盖它阻挠政治会议的召开的阴谋，同时又借此继续阻挠联合国大会复会来讨论朝鲜问题，并想阻止四国外长会议导向有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议。美国在联合国的代表洛奇曾叫嚷说：“就同一问题在同一时间由不同会议予以讨论，那将是不智的，也是有害的”。这种论调显然是为美国既要阻挠政治会议召开又要反对其他重要国际会议讨论朝鲜问题的企图来制造借口的。
    现在，所有愿意看到朝鲜严重局势得以缓和，并进一步谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的国际广泛人士，都认为立即无条件恢复双方会谈，以促成政治会议的迅速召开，具有重大的迫切的意义。这是因为停战协定所规定的目标，不仅是要实现和维护军事上的停战，而且要召开政治会议来处理未行使遣返权利的战俘问题，和进一步谋求从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题的解决，以巩固远东和世界和平。可是，美方于彻底破坏“职权范围”的同时，又竭力阻挠政治会议的召开，使停战协定的全部实施及朝鲜和平的巩固，都受到日益严重的威胁。如果继续听任美方的长期阻挠，使政治会议的召开愈离愈远，那就只会有利于美国统治集团竭力保持朝鲜及国际紧张局势，而不利于巩固远东及世界各国的和平与安全。
    因此，朝中方面代表奇石福、黄华所提双方会谈定于二月一日在板门店复会的提议，完全符合于世界各国人民的和平愿望。美方想坚持其无理主张，在双方联络秘书会议中继续实行拖延政策，是没有道理的。现在对于美方诚意的考验，已显得这样简单：美方应即与我方确定恢复双方会谈的日期。如果它不同意双方会谈在二月一日复会，就应提出它所认为合适的日期，我方代表已表示愿本一贯的协商精神予以慎重的考虑。这个问题已经不容再行拖延。
