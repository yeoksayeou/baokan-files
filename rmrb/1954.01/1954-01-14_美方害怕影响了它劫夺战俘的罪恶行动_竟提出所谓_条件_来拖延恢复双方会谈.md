Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th. Our Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: The US side made it clear today that they are determined to delay the resumption of bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference until after January 22nd.

Today, US representative Young replied to the Korean-Chinese side that he agreed to hold a liaison secretaries meeting at Panmunjom on January 14th to discuss the "conditions and date" for resuming bilateral talks. The date he agreed to was deliberately one day later than the January 13th proposed by the Korean-Chinese side. The Korean-Chinese side requested the liaison secretaries meeting solely to discuss the date for resuming talks, while Young also demanded discussion of the "conditions" for resuming talks.

Obviously, the US side is playing with the earnest desire of people around the world for an immediate arrangement of the Korean political conference to ease the Korean situation. The US side's extraneous demand to discuss the so-called "conditions" for resuming talks is purely a means to delay the resumption of talks. The bilateral talks were interrupted by the US side itself, and the only condition for resuming talks is for the US side to return to Panmunjom. There are no other conditions. The US side's purpose in making this demand is to use this groundless topic to prevent the immediate resumption of bilateral talks, in order to realize its conspiracy of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. US representative Dean also told representatives of the countries that sent troops to invade Korea last week that the US does not want to resume talks before January 22nd. Young also stated clearly today that resuming negotiations would not have any impact on the scheduled abduction of prisoners of war at midnight on January 22nd.

Obviously, the Korean-Chinese side's proposal to unconditionally resume bilateral talks has placed the United States in an extremely awkward position. Originally, the United States, fearing the convening of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Korean issue, and fearing that the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference would lead to a Five-Nation Conference, deliberately created an impression of wanting to resume bilateral talks in order to obstruct the convening of the United Nations General Assembly and the Five-Nation Conference. To this end, they even fabricated rumors, falsely claiming that they had conducted so-called "informal consultations" with the Korean-Chinese side in order to resume bilateral talks, and so on. However, now that the United Nations General Assembly and the Four Foreign Ministers Conference have not been avoided, the issue of resuming bilateral talks has been placed before it, causing great inconvenience to its conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war on January 23rd. Therefore, it has no choice but to use so-called "conditions" and so on to delay the resumption of bilateral talks.

Because this peaceful and just proposal of the Korean and Chinese governments has clearly had a great impact on peace-loving people around the world, the United States knows that its blatant delaying tactics cannot deceive people and are not sufficient. Therefore, it has instigated the United Kingdom to use flowery language and distort the facts, attempting to shift the responsibility for delaying the resumption of bilateral talks onto the Korean-Chinese side. The British Foreign Office spokesman, as well as the British Information Service and the British "Manchester Guardian," issued a series of slanders and attacks on Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on the 11th, which were obviously authorized by Washington. It is clear that the United States illegally and unilaterally stopped explanations, and fears extending explanations lest many prisoners of war have the opportunity to request repatriation. Therefore, it wants to delay the resumption of bilateral talks so that the political conference cannot be convened quickly to deal with the prisoner of war issue. However, British officials have instead falsely claimed that the Korean-Chinese side's statement is deliberately using extended explanations to delay the Korean political conference. It is clear that the United States sent Syngman Rhee's troops and constables disguised as civil police to the demilitarized zone to create incidents and sabotage the armistice when they forcibly detain prisoners of war. The "Manchester Guardian" has reversed right and wrong by calling Premier Zhou Enlai's statement, which seeks a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, as "a preliminary action to resume the war."

It is well known that the US side is implementing a policy of secret agent terror against prisoners of war, undermining the repatriation agreement, and is preparing to forcibly detain a large number of captured Korean and Chinese personnel. The interim report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has also proven this criminal action by the US side, and the Commission has therefore advocated supplementing the explanation dates for prisoners of war. However, the British Foreign Office spokesman brazenly followed behind the United States, saying without reason that "Korean prisoners of war should be released on January 23rd," and, echoing the US tone, arrogantly said that this is "an opinion that Britain cannot change." People deeply smell the aroma of dollars here. The British government, disregarding the interests of the British people, is willing to follow the United States in maintaining international tension. This is something that peace-loving people around the world must pay serious attention to.

### 美方害怕影响了它劫夺战俘的罪恶行动  竟提出所谓“条件”来拖延恢复双方会谈

    美方害怕影响了它劫夺战俘的罪恶行动
    竟提出所谓“条件”来拖延恢复双方会谈
   【新华社开城十二日电】本社特派记者江南报道：美方今天表明：他们决心要把恢复关于政治会议问题的双方会谈一事拖到一月二十二日以后。
    美方杨格今天答复朝中方面说，他同意在一月十四日在板门店举行联络秘书会议，以讨论恢复双方会谈的“条件和日期”。他所同意的日期故意比朝中方面提出的一月十三日要迟一天，朝中方面要求举行联络秘书会议仅仅是为了讨论恢复会谈的日期，而杨格却还要求讨论恢复会谈的“条件”。
    很明显，美方是在玩弄全世界人民要求立即安排朝鲜政治会议以缓和朝鲜局势的殷切愿望。美方节外生枝地要求讨论恢复会谈的所谓“条件”，完全只是用来拖延会谈恢复的一种手段。双方会谈是美方自己中断的，恢复会谈的唯一条件就是美方回到板门店来，此外没有任何条件可言。美方提出这个要求，其目的就是要用这个莫须有的题目，使双方会谈不能立即恢复，以便美方实现其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。美国代表迪安在上星期还对出兵侵朝的国家的代表们说过，美国不希望在一月二十二日以前恢复会谈。杨格今天也明白地说，恢复谈判对预定在一月二十二日午夜劫走战俘一事不会有任何影响。
    显然，朝中方面要求无条件恢复双方会谈的主张已使美国陷于极端窘迫的境地。本来美国因为害怕召开联合国大会来讨论朝鲜问题，并害怕由柏林四国外长会议导向五国会议，因此它故意放出空气，装成要恢复双方会谈的样子，来阻挠联合国大会及五国会议的召开，为此他们甚至无中生有，大造谣言，说他们已与朝中方面进行了所谓“非正式商谈”，以便恢复双方会谈等等。但是，现在联合国大会及四国外长会议还没有躲过，恢复双方会谈的问题又已摆在它的面前，使它在一月二十三日强迫扣留战俘的阴谋大感不便，因此，它只得用所谓“条件”等等来拖延恢复双方会谈。
    由于朝中两国政府这一和平的、正义的主张已经明显的对全世界爱好和平人民发生了极大的影响，美国知道自己露骨的拖延办法骗不了人，不够用，因此，它又嗾使英国来花言巧语，歪曲事实，企图把拖延恢复双方会谈的责任推在朝中方面身上。英国外交部发言人以及英国新闻处、英国“曼彻斯特卫报”在十一日对周恩来部长的声明发出一连串显然经过华盛顿授意的诬蔑攻击。明明是美国非法片面停止解释，并害怕延长解释，以免许多战俘有机会要求遣返，因此它要拖延恢复双方会谈，使政治会议不能迅速召开来处理战俘问题，可是，英国官方人士却反噬朝中方面的声明是故意以延长解释来拖延朝鲜政治会议。明明是美国派遣李承晚的军队和宪兵假装民政警察到非军事区去，要在他们强迫扣留战俘时制造事件，破坏停战，“曼彻斯特卫报”却颠倒是非地把谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的周恩来部长的声明，说成是“恢复战争的一个初步行动”。
    举世皆知美国方面对战俘实行特务恐怖政策，破坏遣俘协议，并正在准备强迫扣留大批朝中被俘人员。中立国遣返委员会临时报告也已证明了美方这种罪恶行动，委员会并因此而主张补足对战俘的解释日期。但是，英国外交部发言人却硬着头皮跟在美国后面，毫无道理地说什么“朝鲜战俘应在一月二十三日释放”，并且学着美国腔调，蛮横地说什么这是“英国不能改变的意见”。人们从这里深深地嗅到了美元的气息。英国政府不顾英国人民的利益，宁愿随从美国来保持国际紧张局势，这是世界爱好和平人民必须予以严重注意的。
