Response to Readers' Criticism and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Letter from Zhang Shulin, Deputy Manager, and Wang Yupu, Deputy Chief of the Finance and Accounting Section of the China Department Store Suihua Wholesale Station: The criticism from Comrade Zhao Wenbin, published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on September 24th of last year, regarding our station's accumulation of over 1 billion yuan in funds for half a year is completely correct. The occurrence of fund accumulation due to incorrect and duplicate payments has happened more than once in our station in the past. Although the amount was not as large as this time, the nature of the problem is the same. The long-term existence of this situation indicates that there is a serious bureaucratic work style in our work. Under the influence of the erroneous "supply system" ideology, managers only focused on completing procurement and supply tasks, neglecting leadership over financial and accounting work; the finance and accounting section was mired in trivial matters all day long and did not understand the specific circumstances of business operations. This situation affected the normal turnover of funds and violated the principle of increasing production and practicing economy. In order to correct and prevent this error, we have formulated and are piloting a system for payment, remittance, and communication. In the past two months, the phenomena of wrong remittances and duplicate payments have been initially reversed. We will continue to improve our work in the future to ensure the complete elimination of such errors.

    中国百货公司绥化批发站保证杜绝错付重付货款现象
    中国百货公司绥化批发站副经理张澍霖、财会科副科长王玉璞来信：去年九月二十四日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载的赵文彬同志对我站把十亿多资金积压了半年的批评是完全正确的。这种因错付、重付货款而造成积压资金的事件，我站过去发生过不止一次，虽然数字没有这次大，但性质是相同的。这种情况的长期存在，说明我们工作中有着严重的官僚主义作风。我们在错误的“供给制”思想支配下，经理只重视完成采购供应任务，忽视对财会工作的领导；财会科终日陷于琐屑事务，不了解业务工作的具体情况。这种情况，影响了资金的正常周转，违反了增产节约的原则。为了纠正和防止这一错误，我们已制订并试行了关于解款、汇款和联系的制度，两个月来已初步扭转了错汇、重付等现象，今后还将继续改进工作，保证彻底杜绝这种错误发生。
