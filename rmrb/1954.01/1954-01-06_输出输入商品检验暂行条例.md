The applicant shall bear the consequences of delayed delivery and increased costs due to re-inspection.

If there are any acts of violation of law or dereliction of duty, they shall be investigated and punished by the commodity inspection bureau after being reported; if the circumstances are serious, they shall be handed over to the local judicial organs for handling.

Article 11: If the reporting party or applicant alters or trades certificates, or opens the seal without authorization to replace goods, changes the quality and quantity of commodities, or intentionally alters, moves, or destroys the seals, marks, or labels affixed by the commodity inspection bureau on commodity packaging or items after inspection and appraisal, the commodity inspection bureau may impose a fine of up to 20% of the total value of the commodities stated in the certificate, depending on the severity of the circumstances. The specific measures shall be separately determined by the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Central Government.
