　　Tianjin Residents Subscribe to Over 400 Billion Yuan of Government Bonds
　　Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Exceed Anticipated Bond Subscription Target

　　[This newspaper reports] The work of the Tianjin Municipal National Economic Construction Bond Promotion Committee in promoting bonds throughout the city has basically concluded. Currently, with the exception of the suburbs, the work of factory and enterprise employees, government cadres, cultural, educational, and medical workers, street residents, and people from all walks of life in Tanggu in subscribing to government bonds has concluded successively. Private industrialists and businessmen are still continuing to subscribe to bonds, but are approaching the final stage.

　　In subscribing to national construction bonds, the people of Tianjin demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, regarding supporting the country's socialist construction as their glorious responsibility. The people of all circles in the city officially began subscribing to bonds on January 7th. As of January 27th, the total subscription amount reached 420.06 billion yuan, exceeding the anticipated sales target by 31.25%. Among them, factory and enterprise employees and shop assistants subscribed to 55.943 billion yuan, exceeding the anticipated figure by 80%; state organ staff subscribed to 19.972 billion yuan, exceeding the anticipated figure by more than 150%; cultural, educational, and medical workers subscribed to 9.923 billion yuan, exceeding the anticipated figure by nearly 396%; urban street residents subscribed to 30.56 billion yuan, exceeding the anticipated figure by 53%; people from all walks of life in the Tanggu district subscribed to 13.608 billion yuan, exceeding the anticipated figure by 216%; and private industrialists and businessmen subscribed to over 290 billion yuan, exceeding the anticipated figure by 12%. In the bond subscription process, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and the broad masses of employees and government cadres in various units took the lead in responding to the call of the state and subscribing. Under their leadership, a surge in bond subscriptions was formed throughout the city. Many units exceeded their anticipated subscription figures in two or three days, or even within a few hours. The organs under the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Government completed their subscriptions within two or three days after the start of subscriptions. The employees of the local state-owned North China Oxygen Plant completed their subscription work on the same day it started. Zhang Yongcai, the director of the public security committee of Dong Shengli in the Seventh District, held a family meeting, carefully calculated accounts, and took out 5 million yuan from his savings to subscribe to bonds. Currently, many employees, cadres, residents, and some industrial and commercial households have begun making payments.

　　Xinhua News Agency, January 30th. The industrial and commercial circles in Beijing have exceeded the anticipated subscription target for the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds.

　　Private industrialists and businessmen in the urban areas generally listened to the transmission of the resolution of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Member Representatives' Conference in mid-January, and studied the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period. They recognized the economic and political significance of the state issuing economic construction bonds, recognized the importance of the state's socialist industrialization, and stated that they should actively accumulate funds for the state. At the same time, private industrialists and businessmen also deeply felt that, in the past few years since liberation, through the correct leadership and support of the People's Government, the vast majority of industrial and commercial enterprises have gradually moved towards prosperity and have obtained considerable profits, and have the strength to subscribe to bonds. Therefore, after the promotion work began, the enthusiasm of private industrialists and businessmen to subscribe to bonds was very high. As of January 28th, 506 industrial and commercial households in the Qianmen District had subscribed to 22.49 billion yuan. When Fu Huating, chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, talked about the bond subscription situation of the industrial and commercial circles this year, he said: "Everyone's enthusiasm is high for this bond subscription, mainly because they have the strength." The Yuanxing Factory in Xuanwu District obtained a profit of 390 million yuan in 1953 and subscribed to 100 million yuan this time. The manager of the Yuanxing Factory stated: "Our factory can make money because of the government's strong support. Now the country is carrying out economic construction, and we must actively support it."

　　Because the suburban areas started earlier, on January 26th, the bonds subscribed to by private industrial and commercial households in the suburban areas had exceeded the anticipated figure.

    【新华社三十日讯】北京市工商界已超额完成一九五四年国家经济建设公债的预计认购数字。
    城区私营工商业者一般在一月中旬听了北京市工商业联合会会员代表大会决议的传达，并学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，认识了国家发行经济建设公债的经济意义和政治意义，认识到国家社会主义工业化的重要，应积极为国家积累资金，乃纷纷表示拥护国家发行经济建设公债，同时私营工商业者也都深深感到，解放后几年来，经过人民政府的正确领导和扶植，绝大部分工商企业逐年走向繁荣，获得了不少利润，有力量认购公债。因此，推销工作开始后，私营工商业者认购公债的热情很高。前门区工商户截至一月二十八日止，五百零六户已认购了二百二十四亿九百多万元。市工商业联合会主任委员傅华亭当谈到今年工商界认购公债的情况时说：“这次认购公债，大家情绪热烈，主要是因为有力量。”宣武区元兴工厂，一九五三年获利润三亿九千万元，这次认购了一亿元，元兴工厂的经理表示：“我们工厂能赚钱是因为政府的大力扶植，现在国家正在进行经济建设，我们要积极支援。”
    郊区因开始的时间较早，一月二十六日，郊区私营工商户所认购的公债已超过预计数字。
