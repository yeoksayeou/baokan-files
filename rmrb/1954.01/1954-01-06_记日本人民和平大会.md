    A Record of the Japanese People's Peace Congress

    On December 14th and 15th, 1953, seven hundred and forty representatives of peace movements from all over Japan held the "Japanese People's Peace Congress" in Tokyo. The congress discussed how to further develop the Japanese peace movement under the current situation, and passed the "Declaration of the Japanese People's Peace Congress" and important resolutions such as opposing rearmament, opposing accepting US Common Security Agency "aid," and launching a movement to defend the peaceful constitution.

    The congress venue was set at the Kyobashi Public Hall, with a painting of a peace dove and a huge banner reading "Let's Join Hands to Strive for Peace" hanging on the rostrum. The venue was decorated with gifts from representatives from various places expressing the Japanese people's desire for peace.

    The congress opened at 10:00 a.m. on the 14th and elected a presidium consisting of Yoshitaro Hirano, Hachijiro Kazahaya, Kenjiro Yanagida, Akira Kazami, Makoto Hori, Goro Hani, Kitaro Shimizu, Kinichi Saionji, Takudo Koma, Hideo Yamahana, Saburo Endo, Toshio Tokunaga, Keiei Hamada, Akira Maruyama, Hajime Matsuura, Jokyo Muchaku, Kazuo Takeuchi, Takao Ogata, Mitsuo Uchiyama, and others.

    Kiichiro Kimura, a Labor-Farmer Party member of the House of Councillors, gave a report on the domestic situation in Japan. He said that the Yoshida government had already wooed and bought over the Hatoyama Liberal Party and was also wooing and buying over the Reform Party in an attempt to organize a coalition regime of conservative parties in order to accept US Common Security Agency "aid," revise the Japanese peaceful constitution, and massively rearm Japan. Kimura revealed that negotiations between the Yoshida government and the US government regarding the rearmament of Japan with "US aid" had actually been going on for some time. On February 28, 1953, Izeki, director of the International Cooperation Bureau of the Yoshida government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had already revealed at a meeting of major Japanese munitions capitalists in Osaka that the Yoshida government was negotiating with the United States regarding Common Security Agency "aid." The US government had already stipulated the amount of US Common Security Agency "aid" to Japan in the 1953-1954 budget, and the US government also stipulated that this "aid" was "ready-made weapons and training expenses." The so-called "ready-made weapons" are weapons that the US military has used on the Korean battlefield, and the so-called "training expenses" are actually the funds for the US military advisory group sent to Japan to supervise Japan's rearmament. Excluding ammunition and equipment, the security force requires an average of 1 million yen per person per year, and the budget for this year, after two supplements, has already reached 102.72 billion yen. The Yoshida government is also planning to increase the funds for expanding the security force by 30 to 40 billion yen in next year's budget. Due to the large increase in military expenditures, expenditures related to people's welfare have been greatly reduced. On the other hand, the government has raised the prices of public utilities such as national railways and electricity, and market prices have risen accordingly. Moreover, the government is planning to increase taxes, which makes the burden on the broad masses of the people even heavier, and they are therefore on the verge of despair. Kimura further pointed out that the United States' purpose is to use Japanese people as cannon fodder for the United States as soon as possible, and to use the taxes squeezed from the Japanese people to support the Japanese army that serves the United States.

    Amidst warm applause, the congress announced that it had received nearly a hundred congratulatory telegrams and letters from people's organizations such as the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, the Democratic United Front of Korean Residents in Japan, and the Japan Women's Organizations Federation from all over the country.

    The congress also read congratulatory telegrams from the World Peace Council, the Indonesian National Peace Committee, the Italian Peace Committee, and world peace advocates Joliot-Curie, Johnson, Nenni, Mooregun (editor-in-chief of "Defense of Peace" magazine), Wen Youzhang, Han Xueye, Jacques Denis (Secretary General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth), and others from all over the world. Each congratulatory telegram was warmly applauded by the representatives in the audience.

    In the afternoon, Professor Ikuo Oyama, chairman of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, after accepting flowers, reported to the congress on the international situation and outlined his attendance at the World Peace Council, the World Women's Congress, the World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival, and his visits to the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Ikuo Oyama said: "The great struggle of the Korean people has proven to the world that the struggle for national independence cannot be defeated by any force." "The World Peace Council meeting in Budapest decided on the principle of resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation." He then pointed out that now, the important significance of resolving international disputes through consultation and concluding a five-power peace pact is becoming clearer, but despite this, the United States still refuses to consult and still obstructs the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations, which is simply intolerable. Ikuo Oyama also said: "I firmly believe that the Japanese people can contribute to world peace with practical achievements like the people of China, Korea, and Vietnam." Ikuo Oyama concluded by saying that the US Common Security Agency "aid" to Japan is a serious obstacle to the Japanese people's peace movement, and he asked the congress to formulate a clear movement policy against accepting US Common Security Agency "aid."

    Jiichiro Matsumoto, president of the Japan-China Friendship Association, then spoke, exposing the shameless lies fabricated by the US-Japan reactionaries for accepting the US Common Security Agency's "aid" and rearming Japan, that Japan would be "invaded" by China and the Soviet Union. Based on what he personally heard and witnessed during his three months in China, he explained that the Chinese people love peace and that China is a country that truly seeks world peace. He also pointed out: "The US Common Security Agency's 'aid' to Japan is a loan mortgaged with the blood of Japanese youth."

    After representatives from Yamagata, Hokkaido, Miyagi, Fukuoka, and other places reported on the peace movement in their respective regions, the congress was divided into seven groups to discuss issues such as livelihood protection, military bases and rural fishing villages, health issues, education and culture, human rights issues, international issues, and peace issues until late at night.

    At 9:00 a.m. on December 15th, the chairpersons of each group meeting successively reported on the discussions and results of the group. These reports showed that because the Yoshida government followed US orders and stepped up rearmament, the lives of the Japanese people had become extremely difficult. Prices continued to rise, workers' wages were suppressed, and they were laid off in large numbers. The broad masses of farmers struggled under the tyranny of the Yoshida government's suppression of rice purchase prices and the imposition of heavy taxes. These reports also showed that the US military used military bases to control Japan's land, sky, and sea, and the lives of the Japanese people were directly threatened. Residents in the high-altitude artillery area near Misawa Air Base lived almost day and night under the death threat of shells. The health of residents near US military bases was seriously damaged, especially the spread of venereal diseases. The physical and mental development of children growing up in the decadent environment of US military bases was extremely adversely affected. These reports also revealed that the Yoshida government brutally undermined the human rights of the Japanese people in order to pave the way for rearmament, placing the Japanese people in a state of terror with no freedom. Residents in mountainous areas of Iwate Prefecture were persecuted simply for mentioning "peace." A clerk in a department store in Yamagata Prefecture was fired simply for mentioning "trade union" in his speech. Many Japanese returnees from China were forced to accept "ideological investigation." These reports unanimously pointed out that the broad masses of Japanese people from all walks of life, including workers, farmers, students, citizens, and small and medium-sized enterprises, were in a miserable situation, and they urgently demanded a peaceful life and opposed rearmament and accepting US Common Security Agency "aid."

    Before the discussion in the afternoon, the congress read congratulatory telegrams from the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Secretariat of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Liaison Committee, and these two congratulatory telegrams were greeted with warm and long applause from all the representatives.

    After heated discussions, the representatives passed the "Declaration of the Japanese People's Peace Congress." The declaration pointed out that in order to defend peaceful life and democratic freedom, it is necessary to transform the military economy into a peaceful economy, defend the peaceful constitution, and oppose accepting US Common Security Agency "aid" and rearmament; in order to defend world peace, it is necessary to remove foreign military bases and withdraw foreign troops, implement disarmament, and prohibit weapons of mass slaughter such as atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. The declaration also called on governments of all countries to resolve all disputes through consultation and hold a five-power peace conference. The declaration also called for promoting the success of negotiations on the Korean political conference and holding Vietnam ceasefire negotiations.

    Subsequently, the congress passed a resolution opposing the Yoshida government's conspiracy to revise the Japanese Constitution for the purpose of rearmament and launched a signature campaign to defend the Constitution. The resolution also stated that the Japanese people would never be dragged into war again and would do their best to defend the peaceful constitution.

    The congress also passed the following resolutions: 1. Demand a fair judgment in the "Matsukawa Incident"; 2. Support the movement of the people of the Ryukyu Islands to return to their motherland; 3. Support the Second Japan Student Peace Congress being prepared by the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations; 4. Support the struggle of the people of Mount Myogi against military bases; 5. Strive to realize the invitation of representatives of the Chinese Red Cross Society and representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to visit Japan; 6. Widely publicize the truth about the incident of the detention of Soviet fishing boats and expose anti-Soviet deceptive propaganda; 7. Oppose reactionary cultural and educational policies and protect Japanese youth and children.

    After Professor Hajime Matsuura delivered the closing speech, the congress closed amidst the cheers of peace from all the representatives. (Attached picture)

    记日本人民和平大会
    一九五三年十二月十四日和十五日，日本全国各地和平运动代表七百四十人，在东京举行了“日本人民和平大会”。大会讨论了如何在当前局势下进一步展开日本和平运动的问题，并通过了“日本人民和平大会的宣言”和反对重新武装、反对接受美国共同安全署“援助”、展开保卫和平宪法运动等重要决议。
    大会会场设在京桥公会堂，主席台上高悬着和平鸽画像和巨幅的“大家携起手来争取和平”的标语。会场中装饰着各地代表们带给大会的表达日本人民和平愿望的献礼。
    十四日上午十时大会开幕，选出平野义太郎、风早八十二、柳田谦十郎、风见章、堀真琴、羽仁五郎、清水几太郎、西园寺公一、来间琢道、山花秀雄、远藤三郎、德永利雄、滨田系卫、丸山辉、松浦一、无着成恭、竹内一雄、绪方孝男、内山光雄等组成主席团。
    劳农党参议员木村禧八郎作了关于日本国内情势的报告。他说，现在吉田政府已经拉拢收买了鸠山自由党，并在收买拉拢改进党，企图组织保守党派联合政权，以便接受美国共同安全署“援助”，修改日本和平宪法，大规模重新武装日本。木村揭露说，吉田政府和美国政府之间关于以“美援”重新武装日本的谈判实际上早就在进行了。一九五三年二月二十八日，吉田政府外务省国际协力局局长伊关在大阪的日本大军火资本家会议席上就已透露说，吉田政府正在和美国进行关于共同安全署“援助”的谈判。美国政府已经在一九五三—一九五四年度预算中规定了美国共同安全署对日本“援助”的数字，美国政府并且规定了这项“援助”是“现成的武器和训练费用”。所谓“现成的武器”就是美军在朝鲜战场使用过了的武器，所谓“训练费用”实际就是美国派遣到日本来监督日本重新武装的美国军事顾问团的经费。保安队除去军火装备外，每人每年平均需费用一百万日圆，本年度的预算经过两次补充，已经达到一万零二百七十二亿日圆，吉田政府并筹划在明年度预算中增加扩充保安队的经费三百亿到四百亿日圆。由于军事费用大量增加，有关人民福利的支出就被大大缩减。另一方面，政府又提高了国营铁道、电气等公用事业的价格，市场物价随之上涨，而且政府正在计划提高捐税，这就使广大人民的负担更趋沉重、因而濒于绝境。木村进一步指出，美国的目的是要尽快地用日本人替美国当炮灰，并用从日本人民身上榨取的税金奉养为美国服务的日本军队。
    大会在热烈的掌声中，宣布收到日苏亲善协会、旅日朝鲜侨民民主统一战线、日本妇女团体联合会等人民团体近一百封发自国内各地的贺电和贺信。
    大会并宣读了世界和平理事会、印尼全国和平委员会、意大利和平委员会及世界和平人士约里奥—居里、约翰逊、南尼、摩尔岗（“保卫和平”杂志总编辑）、文幼章、韩雪野、雅克·德尼（世界民主青年联盟总书记）等发自世界各地的贺电。每一封贺电都受到全场代表热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    下午，日本拥护和平委员会主席大山郁夫教授在接受献花后，向大会报告了国际形势，并概述了他出席世界和平理事会、世界妇女大会、世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节，访问苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的情况。大山郁夫说：“朝鲜人民的伟大斗争向全世界证明了，争取民族独立的斗争是任何武力所不能战胜的。”“在布达佩斯举行的世界和平理事会会议决定了用和平协商方式解决国际争端的方针。”他接着指出，现在，协商解决国际争端和缔结五大国和平公约的重要意义更加清楚地显示出来了，但尽管如此，美国仍然拒绝协商，并且仍然阻挠中华人民共和国恢复它在联合国的合法地位，这简直是令人不能容忍的。大山郁夫并且说：“我深信日本人民是能够像中国、朝鲜、越南人民那样，以实际成就贡献给世界和平的。”大山郁夫最后说，美国对日本的共同安全署“援助”是日本人民和平运动的严重障碍，他要求大会制订明确的反对接受美国共同安全署“援助”的运动方针。
    日中友好协会会长松本治一郎接着发言，他揭穿了美日反动派为接受美国共同安全署的“援助”，进行重新武装而捏造的日本会受到中国、苏联“侵略”的无耻谎言。他以在中国三个月期间亲自耳闻目睹的情况，说明中国人民热爱和平，中国是个真正要求世界和平的国家。他并且指出：“美国对日本的共同安全署‘援助’是用日本青年的鲜血作抵押品的贷款”。
    山形、北海道、宫城、福冈等地方的代表报告了各地和平运动情况后，大会即分成维护生活问题、军事基地与农村渔村问题、健康问题、教育和文化问题、人权问题、国际问题、和平问题等七个小组进行讨论，直至夜深。
    十二月十五日上午九时，各小组会议的主席相继报告了小组讨论的情况和结果。这些报告说明，由于吉田政府遵从美国命令加紧进行重新武装，日本人民生活已经极端困苦。物价不断上涨，工人工资被压低，而且被大批解雇。广大农民在吉田政府压低收购食米价格和征收重税的暴政下挣扎。这些报告也说明，美国军队利用军事基地控制了日本的陆地、天空和海洋，日本人民生命直接受到威胁。三泽空军基地附近高射炮地区的居民几乎是日夜在炮弹的死亡威胁中生活着。美军基地附近的居民，健康受到严重损害，特别是性病蔓延。在美军伤风败俗的环境中成长起来的儿童，身心发展受到极其恶劣的影响。这些报告并揭露，吉田政府为了铺平重新武装道路残暴地摧残日本人民的人权，使日本人民处身于毫无自由的恐怖统治中。岩手县山区居民，只要提到“和平”，就会受到迫害。山形县一个百货店的店员，只因为说话中说到了“工会”就被解雇了。许多从中国归来的日侨，被强迫接受“思想调查”。这些报告一致指出，包括工人、农民、学生、市民和中小企业者等各阶层的广大日本人民，正陷于水深火热的悲惨境况中，他们迫切要求和平生活，反对重新武装、反对接受美国共同安全署“援助”。
    大会下午在进行讨论前，宣读了刚刚接到的中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处发来的贺电，这两封贺电受到全场代表热烈而长久的鼓掌欢迎。
    代表们经过热烈讨论，通过了“日本人民和平大会的宣言”。宣言指出：为了保卫和平生活与民主自由，必须把军事经济转变为和平经济，保卫和平宪法，反对接受美国共同安全署“援助”和重新武装；为了保卫世界和平，要撤除外国军事基地和撤出外国军队，实行裁减军备，禁止原子弹、氢弹等大规模屠杀的武器。宣言并要求各国政府用协商方式解决一切争端，举行五大国和平会议。宣言也要求促进关于朝鲜政治会议的谈判成功和举行越南停战谈判。
    接着，大会通过决议，反对吉田政府为了重新武装而修改日本宪法的阴谋，展开保卫宪法的签名运动。决议并且说：日本人民决不愿意再被拖入战争，并将尽全力保卫和平宪法。
    大会还通过了下列各项决议：一、要求“松川事件”的公正判决；二、支援琉球群岛人民复归祖国运动；三、支援全日本学生自治会总联合会正在筹备召开的第二次日本学生和平大会；四、支援妙义山人民反对军事基地的斗争；五、努力使邀请中国红十字会代表和中国人民政治协商会议代表访问日本实现；六、广泛宣传扣留苏联渔业小汽艇事件真相，揭露反苏的欺骗宣传；七、反对反动的文化教育政策，保护日本青年与儿童。
    松浦一教授致闭幕词后，大会在全场代表高呼和平万岁声中闭幕。（附图片）
