    Two People Doing the Work of Three
  　By our reporter Chen Ji
    In the great cause of the motherland's industrialization, everyone is willing to contribute more of their strength. Zhang Zhisheng, a car electrician, and Xu Jialin, a car inspector, at the Tianjin Vehicle Depot implemented joint operations, with two people doing the work of three.
    Zhang Zhisheng and Xu Jialin have worked together for a long time, serving on the Tianjin-Shanghai train. Xu Jialin is a skilled car inspector. He knows the condition of the train as clearly as he knows his wife. As the train moves, if it makes even a slight noise, he knows what the problem is without even looking. Zhang Zhisheng often rides with him and likes to watch his every move while he works. Sometimes, when Xu Jialin talks about his work experiences, Zhang Zhisheng silently remembers them. Before long, Zhang Zhisheng also understood some of the car inspector's techniques. One day, Xu Jialin said to Zhang Zhisheng, "Old Zhang, try out my work!" Zhang Zhisheng quietly climbed under the car and checked the various components, following Xu Jialin's way of working. Xu Jialin stood beside him and said with a smile, "Hey! Not bad, you can do my job too." From then on, they decided to implement joint operations, helping each other with their work and exchanging work experiences.
    When foreman Wan Cun'en heard that they were implementing joint operations, he wanted to test their work. One day, three components under the train were broken. Wan Cun'en called Zhang Zhisheng and asked him to check them. Zhang Zhisheng checked and found two faulty components, and told Wan Cun'en. Wan Cun'en tilted his head and asked, "Is there anything else wrong?" "No, there isn't," Zhang Zhisheng replied confidently. Wan Cun'en said, "No! Take a look at the handbrake." Zhang Zhisheng looked at the handbrake and indeed found a problem. Wan Cun'en said to him kindly, "If you want to be a good car inspector, you must be careful and not be careless. But you are a car electrician, and it's pretty good that you have learned the techniques of a car inspector to this extent!"
    This unexpected test increased Zhang Zhisheng's enthusiasm for learning. He and Xu Jialin often used this kind of testing method to encourage each other and learn techniques. Over time, Zhang Zhisheng could independently do Xu Jialin's work, and Xu Jialin could also do Zhang Zhisheng's work. One person learned the techniques of two types of work. This is the beginning of comprehensive development of technology. This beginning led to changes in labor organization. Originally, the Tianjin-Shanghai train was equipped with two car inspectors and one car electrician to operate a train. This labor organization was determined based on two different types of work. Now that Zhang Zhisheng and Xu Jialin can both do two types of work, the labor organization is no longer suitable for the new development. Zhang Zhisheng and Xu Jialin both felt that: if one person can do two jobs, and two people take turns on duty, it is enough to operate a train. Why do you need three people? They wanted to propose reducing one person, but they felt that changing the superior's system could not be done casually without any preparation. They decided to try it first. After trying it for more than ten days, there were no accidents and they did not feel tired. So Zhang Zhisheng reported their suggestion to the superiors. The superiors immediately sent someone to work with them to see if this suggestion would work. In October of last year, it was decided to adopt their suggestion, reducing the number of people per shift from three to two. There are six shifts on the Tianjin-Shanghai train, reducing six people. Since October of last year, Zhang Zhisheng and Xu Jialin have been working for more than two months, doing the work of three people without any accidents. Today, Zhang Zhisheng has reached the technical level of a fourth-grade car inspector.

    两个人做三个人的工作
  　本报记者　陈　迹
    在祖国工业化的伟大事业中，谁都愿意更多的贡献出自己的力量，天津车辆段车电工张芷升和检车工徐嘉林实行联合作业，两个人做了三个人的工作。
    张芷升和徐嘉林很早就在一起工作，包乘津沪列车。徐嘉林是个检车能手，他了解列车的情况，如同了解他的爱人一样的清楚。走动着的列车，只要发出一点杂音，他不看，就知道这是什么毛病。张芷升常常跟他一起乘车，喜欢看他工作时的一举一动。有时候，徐嘉林谈起自己工作的体会，张芷升都默默地记在心里。没多久，张芷升也懂得一些检车工的技术。有一天，徐嘉林跟张芷升说：“老张，你试一试我的工作看！”张芷升不声不气，爬进车底，照着徐嘉林工作的样子，检查了各种部件。徐嘉林站在旁边，笑着说：“嘿！行呀，你也能干我这一行了。”从此，他们决定实行联合作业，互相帮助工作，交流工作经验。
    工长万存恩听说他们实行联合作业，想要试一试他们的工作。一天，列车底下的三个部件坏了，万存恩便把张芷升找来，要张芷升检查。张芷升检查出两个有毛病的部件，告诉万存恩。万存恩歪着头，问道：“还有什么毛病吗？”“再没有了。”张芷升很有把握地答道。万存恩说：“不对！你瞧瞧手闸看。”张芷升看了手闸，果真发现了毛病。万存恩亲切地向他说：“你想要做一个好的检车工，应该细心，不能马虎一点。不过你是个车电工，学习检车工的技术到这样的程度，总算不错！”
    张芷升受了这次意外的考试，更提高了学习的情绪。他和徐嘉林也常常采用这种考试的办法，互相鼓励，学习技术。日子久了，张芷升能单独地做徐嘉林的工作，徐嘉林也能做张芷升的工作。一个人学会两种工种的技术。这是全面发展技术的开端。这个开端，引起了劳动组织的改变。原来在津沪列车上，都配备两个检车工和一个车电工，来包乘一趟列车。这个劳动组织，是根据两个不同工种来确定的。现在张芷升和徐嘉林都能做两个工种的工作，因之劳动组织已不适合新的发展。张芷升和徐嘉林都觉得：一个人能做两门工作，两个人轮流值班，包乘一趟列车，就可以了，何必还要三个人呢？他们想提出减少一个人的建议，但他们又觉得要改变上级的制度，不能随随便便，不能没有一点准备。他们决定先试一试。试了十多天，没有出一件事故，也不感到疲劳。于是张芷升把他们这个建议报告给上级。上级马上派了人，随同他们工作，看看这个建议行不行。去年十月，决定采用他们的建议，每班由三个人减至两个人。津沪列车共有六个班，减少六个人。张芷升和徐嘉林两个人，从去年十月起，工作了两个多月，做好三个人的工作，没有发生任何事故。今天，张芷升已达到四级检车工的技术水平了。
