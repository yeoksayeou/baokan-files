    Xinhua News Agency, January 5th: Under the Yoshida government's rearmament policy and the brutal exploitation by Japanese monopoly capital, the lives of the Japanese working people are increasingly falling into a miserable state.

    Throughout 1953, due to the continuous rise in prices, the already meager real wages of Japanese workers further declined. Even according to figures released by the Japanese government, the consumer price index in various parts of Japan in August 1953 increased by 7.3% compared to the same month in 1952, while the real wages of workers only increased by 5.9%.

    Japanese workers, already overwhelmed by rising prices, have also suffered from layoffs by monopoly capitalists. Since the summer of 1953, many industrial sectors in Japan have implemented so-called "enterprise rationalization" measures to make the economy militarized, throwing tens of thousands of workers into the ranks of the unemployed. According to official statistics, in July 1953, the number of industrial workers in Japan decreased by 2.11 million compared to December 1952, and the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the country reached 10.72 million, accounting for approximately 13% of the Japanese population.

    Monopoly capitalists are also taking advantage of the large number of unemployed to intensify the exploitation of employed workers even more. Taking the Yubari Mine of Hokkaido Coal Mining and Steamship Company as an example, after the capitalists laid off a large number of workers, the workload of the remaining workers immediately doubled. At the same time, not only did the workers' wages not increase, but they were reduced from 700 yen per day to 500 yen. Japanese coal miners describe their lives as "hell" in the true sense of the word.

    The situation of Japanese female workers is even more tragic than that of male workers. Taking textile female workers, who account for 90% of the total number of female workers, as an example, they engage in very heavy labor all day long, just like male workers, but their income is only half of that of male workers, with an average monthly wage of only 3,000 yen. Currently, the minimum expenditure for an average worker's family is more than 20,000 yen. Therefore, they and their dependent families are often in a state of starvation.

    Under the dual plunder of the Yoshida government and feudal landlords, the lives of the vast majority of Japanese farmers are even more miserable than those of workers. The income of each farmer is less than half of that of a worker. Therefore, many farm households are unable to make ends meet and rely on loans to maintain their lives. According to a recent survey by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Yoshida government, more than 40% of farm households across the country are in debt, with the average total debt per farm household ranging from 40,000 yen to 50,000 yen. The Yoshida government's commitment to rearmament, which has led to the disrepair of water conservancy, caused Japanese farmers to suffer severe floods in 1953, leading to the bankruptcy and displacement of a large number of farmers. Japanese feudal landlords are taking advantage of the opportunities presented by farmers' borrowing and disasters to plunder their land on a large scale. In Miyagi Prefecture alone, the land seized by landlords in the first half of 1953 reached 60,000 cho (approximately 15 mu per cho).

    As the Yoshida government intensifies its promotion of rearmament, the lives of the Japanese working people are facing an even more serious threat. Therefore, the declaration of the recent Japanese People's Peace Congress pointed out that in order to protect their lives, the broad masses of Japanese working people must transform the military economy into a peaceful economy and oppose accepting the US Mutual Security Agency's "aid" and rearmament.

    吉田政府加紧重整军备，垄断资本家进行残暴剥削
    日本工人大批失业许多农民靠借贷过活
    【新华社五日讯】在吉田政府重整军备政策和日本垄断资本的残暴剥削下，日本劳动人民的生活正日益陷于凄惨的境地。
    在一九五三年一年中，由于物价不断上涨，日本工人所得到的已经不足温饱的实际工资进一步下降。即使根据日本官方发表的数字，一九五三年八月份日本各地的消费物价指数也较一九五二年同月上涨了百分之七点三，而工人的实际工资却只上升了百分之五点九。
    被物价压得喘不过气来的日本工人，又遭到了垄断资本家解雇的迫害。自一九五三年夏天以来，日本许多产业部门中都实行了使经济军事化的所谓“企业合理化”措施，把成千成万的工人抛入失业的行列。根据官方的统计：一九五三年七月份日本全国的产业工人较一九五二年十二月减少了二百一十一万人，全国失业和半失业者已达一千零七十二万人，约占日本人口百分之十三。
    垄断资本家又利用大量失业队伍的存在来变本加厉地加紧对在职工人的剥削。以北海道煤矿汽船公司的夕张矿山为例，在资方大批解雇工人以后，在职工人的工作立即增多了一倍，在这同时，工人的工资不仅没有提高，反由每天七百日元降低到五百日元。日本煤矿工人把他们的生活名符其实地称之为“地狱”。
    日本女工的境遇比男工更为悲惨。以占女工总数百分之九十的纺织女工来说，她们终日和男工一样从事着非常繁重的劳动，但收入却只有男工的一半，每月的平均工资仅三千日元。而目前一个普通工人的家庭，最少的开支也要两万日元以上。因此她们和由她们赡养的家庭经常处于饥饿中。
    在吉田政府和封建地主的双重掠夺下，日本广大农民的生活比工人还要悲惨。每个农民的收入不及工人的一半。因此，许多农家都是入不敷出，依靠借贷来维持生活。据吉田政府农林省最近的调查：全国农户中有百分之四十以上是负有债务的，平均每一农户负债的总数在四万日元到五万日元之间。吉田政府致力于重整军备而造成的水利失修，使日本农民在一九五三年遭到惨重的水灾，大批农民破产，流离失所。日本封建地主更乘着农民借贷和遭灾的机会大量掠夺他们的土地，仅宫城县一地，一九五三年上半年被地主夺去的土地就达到六万町步（每町步约合十五市亩）之多。
    随着吉田政府加紧推进重整军备，日本劳动人民的生活正在受到更加严重的威胁。因此，最近召开的日本人民和平大会的宣言指出：日本广大的劳动人民为了保卫他们的生活，必须把军事经济转变为和平经济，反对接受美国共同安全署“援助”和重整军备。
