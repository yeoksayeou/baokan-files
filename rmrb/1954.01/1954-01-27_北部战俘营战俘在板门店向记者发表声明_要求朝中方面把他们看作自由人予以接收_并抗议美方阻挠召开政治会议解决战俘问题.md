　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 26th: Three hundred and twenty-five South Korean POWs, twenty-one American POWs, and one British POW who refused repatriation held a press conference in Panmunjom this morning after coming from the Songgok-ri POW camp. American POW Cordon and South Korean POW Hong Dae-kyu read a statement in English and Korean, respectively, on behalf of all the POWs, explaining why they refused repatriation and why they demanded that the Korean and Chinese side receive them as free individuals. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　“We are South Koreans, Americans and British, we love our homes, we love our people, we love our country. Our desire for peace, for true democracy and for racial equality unites us.

　　Why don't we go home?

　　Experience tells us what the current situation is like:

　　In South Korea, for those POWs who have returned, even if they escape the firing squad and concentration camps, they will have to live a life of forced military service under the rule of American puppets, oppression by feudal landlords, poverty and prostitution.

　　In the United States, there is political persecution, McCarthyism, the fate of Dickinson and Batcheller, the Foggy Bottom mental hospital, and the lynch law and racial discrimination against blacks. Now anyone in the United States who talks about peace is immediately labeled a "communist" and loses their civil rights.

　　In England, there is American occupation, being drafted to Korea to fight for the Americans! And then to Indochina? To Pakistan?

　　Here, in the years of POW camp life, we have experienced true democracy for the first time. In the detention area, we have experienced true equality and international friendship among ourselves. We are not communists, although some of us hope to become communists. But here, we have learned a lot and realized what can be achieved when one works for the common good rather than personal gain.

　　Unless peace is preserved, this goal of happiness and prosperity can never be achieved. We believe that our greatest task is to maintain peace and strive for democracy for the people of our countries. But if we go back, our speech will be suppressed. That is why we are staying here.

　　Most of us Koreans have heard the explanation of the United Nations Command and have repeatedly said that we refuse repatriation. Despite our requests, American POWs and one British POW have not heard the explanation. The United Nations Command must bear all responsibility for refusing to explain this to us.

　　Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs have long been subjected to massacre, torture, tattooing and coercion, and finally forced to return to the original detention side, and have never had the opportunity to exercise their right to demand to go home. We know this very well. Our situation cannot be compared with theirs. But what can be compared is that the United Nations Command refuses to explain to us, and at the same time does not allow the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to explain to the South Camp POWs. Related to this is that Dean interrupted the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference, hindering the Korean political conference from resolving the POW issue.

　　As for ourselves, we have decided to stay here based on our own free will, although the Korean and Chinese side has repeatedly advised us to go home. As General Thimayya himself said, since the armistice, any one of us has been able to go back at any time.

　　The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force could and should have continued to take care of all the POWs until the explanation work was completed and they were legally made civilians. If this could not be done, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force had an obligation to release us and make us civilians. They did neither of these things. This is their responsibility.

　　We fully understand why the Korean and Chinese side refuses to receive us as POWs. This is in our interest, and it is also in the interest of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs who are now being forcibly incorporated into the Rhee Syngman and Kuomintang armies. If the Korean and Chinese side accepts, then they would be agreeing to a violation of the Armistice Agreement—handing over Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs to their enemies.

　　This attitude of the Korean and Chinese side is legitimate and just, while the decision to return us as POWs is illegal. If we are returned as POWs, according to the Armistice Agreement or international law, the Korean and Chinese side has no right to declare us civilians.

　　Therefore, we ask the Korean and Chinese side to receive us, and we ask the Korean and Chinese authorities to treat us as free individuals when receiving us. In view of the complete destruction of the agreement by the United Nations Command, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force, we believe this is the only way to solve the problem. We sincerely hope that the Korean and Chinese side will agree with our opinion.

　　In addition, we demand a prompt resolution of the entire POW issue. We protest against the United Nations Command's obstruction of the political conference, believing that this is a major obstacle to the resolution of this issue."

　　北部战俘营战俘在板门店向记者发表声明
　　要求朝中方面把他们看作自由人予以接收
　　并抗议美方阻挠召开政治会议解决战俘问题
    【新华社开城二十六日电】拒绝遣返的三百二十五名南朝鲜战俘、二十一名美国战俘及一名英国战俘，今晨从松谷里战俘营来到板门店举行了记者招待会。美国战俘柯敦和南朝鲜战俘洪大奎代表全体战俘分别以英语和朝鲜语向双方记者宣读了一篇声明，说明他们为什么拒绝遣返，以及为什么要求朝中方面以自由人的身份接收他们。声明的全文如下：
    “我们是南朝鲜人、美国人和英国人，我们爱我们的家乡、爱我们的人民，爱我们的祖国。我们的要求和平、要求真正民主并要求种族平等的愿望，把我们团结在一起。
    我们为何不回家呢？
    经验告诉我们目前的情况是怎样的：
    在南朝鲜，对于那些回去了的战俘来说，即使逃脱了执刑队和集中营，也要过一种在美国傀儡的统治下的强征兵役、封建地主压迫、贫穷和卖淫的生活。
    在美国，是政治迫害、麦卡锡主义、狄根逊和巴契勒的命运、福奇谷精神病院以及对那些黑人的私刑法和种族歧视。现在任何人在美国谈到和平，就立即成为“共产主义者”和丧失公权的人。
    在英国，有美国的占领、被征调到朝鲜为美国人打仗！接着还要在印度支那？在巴基斯坦？
    在这里，我们在几年的战俘营生活中，第一次体验到真正的民主。在看管区，我们在自己中间体验到真正的平等和国际友爱。我们并不是共产主义者，虽然其中有些人希望成为共产主义者。然而在这里，我们学了很多东西，并且领会到，当一个人为了共同利益而不是个人利益而工作时所能获得的成就。
    除非和平保得住，这种幸福和富裕的目标是永远达不到的。我们相信，我们最伟大的任务就是保持和平，为我们国家的人民争取民主。但是如果我们回去的话，我们的言论就会受到压制。这就是我们为什么留在这里的理由。
    我们朝鲜人中间大多数人都听过了联合国军司令部的解释，并且曾经一再地说我们拒绝遣返。尽管我们提出了要求，美国战俘和一位英国战俘迄未听过解释。联合国军司令部在拒绝向我们解释这一点上，必须负一切责任。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战俘长期遭受屠杀、酷刑、刺字和胁迫，最后被迫回到原拘留方面，始终没有得到行使要求回家的权利的机会。我们对这种情形知道得很清楚。我们的情况跟他们的情况是不能相提并论的。但是能够相提并论的是：联合国军司令部拒绝向我们解释，同时又不让朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军对南营战俘进行解释。与这有关的是：迪安中断了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，阻挠朝鲜政治会议解决战俘问题。
    至于我们自己，我们是基于我们自己的自由意志而决定留在这里的，虽然朝中方面一再劝我们回家。正如蒂迈雅将军本人所说的，自停战以来，我们中间任何一个人一直都是能够随时回去的。
    中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队本来可以而且应当继续看管全部战俘，直到完成解释工作和合法地使他们成为平民时为止。如果这点办不到，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队有义务把我们释放，使我们成为平民。这两点他们都没有做到。这是他们的责任。
    我们完全了解朝中方面为什么拒绝把我们当作战俘来接收我们。这是符合于我们的利益的，也是符合于现在被强制编入李承晚和国民党军队里的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战俘的利益的。如果朝中方面接受的话，那么他们就是同意对停战协定的违反——把朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战俘交给他们的敌人。
    朝中方面的这种态度是合法的和公正的，而关于把我们作为战俘交回的决定则是非法的。如果把我们作为战俘交回去，根据停战协定或国际法，朝中方面是没有权利把我们宣布为平民的。
    因此，我们要求朝中方面接收我们，并且要求朝中当局在接收我们的时候把我们看作是自由人。鉴于联合国军司令部、中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队彻底地破坏协定，我们认为这是解决问题的唯一办法。我们诚恳地希望朝中方面同意我们的意见。
    此外，我们要求迅速解决整个战俘问题。我们对联合国军司令部阻挠政治会议提出抗议，认为这对这个问题的解决是一个很大的障碍。”
