Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd — Tianjin's local state-owned and joint state-private light industry factories will produce more than ninety varieties of high-quality, low-priced cotton textiles, knitwear, rubber products, daily necessities, and other products this year to meet the needs of the people's livelihood and national construction.

    The total output value of the textile industry sector this year will increase by 42.45 percent compared to last year. The various printing and dyeing factories will increase the production of printed plain cloth, printed serge, and printed drill by 320,000 bolts compared to last year. The output of fabrics in colors such as bright red, jujube red, and dark green will also increase by 1.09 million bolts. If these printed and colored fabrics are used to make single garments for women, it would be enough for 11 million women to have one set each. Knitwear factories plan to increase the production of short-waisted patterned socks and fleece underwear by 130,000 to 240,000 dozens this year compared to last year. In line with the improvement of urban residents' lives, woolen mills will produce worsted wool serge and women's clothing fabrics this year. In terms of daily necessities and cultural, educational, and medical supplies, new products such as enamel basins, various mugs, portable high-pressure sterilizers, pianos, organs, and double basses will be trial-produced this year. Jinan Leather Factory plans to produce more than 175,000 various balls this year. Rubber factories will increase the supply of truck tires needed for agriculture, forestry, and transportation by more than 20,700 this year compared to last year. Tianjin Grease Factory plans to produce large quantities of hard tallow, crude tallow, and alkaline tallow needed for locomotives this year, to supply the needs of thirteen railway administrations and various locomotive depots in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places. Paper mills plan to produce roofing felt this year to meet the needs of construction projects in North China.

    When drafting their plans, Tianjin's local state-owned and joint state-private light industry factories carefully studied the needs of the people and the factory's equipment conditions. For example, according to materials from the trade departments, the various printing and dyeing factories plan to produce printed fabrics this year with various patterns that were popular with the masses last year, and also collected many new patterns from the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Museum of History, and other places. Because the demand for high-quality colored fabrics is increasing in the market, weaving and dyeing factories will increase equipment and improve operating methods this year to increase production efficiency. Because the planned output of tires has increased this year, Rubber Factory No. 2 recently installed two new rubber mixing machines.

    When drafting their plans, the factories also paid attention to the integration of production, supply, and sales. Most factories have signed supply and sales contracts or agreements with the trade departments to ensure the smooth progress of production this year.

    天津轻工业工厂按照人民需要编制今年计划
    【新华社天津三日电】天津市地方国营、公私合营轻工业工厂今年将生产九十多种物美价廉的棉织、针织、橡胶、日用百货等产品，供应人民生活和国家建设的需要。
    纺织工业部门今年生产总值将比去年增加百分之四十二点四五。各印染厂生产的花平布、花哔叽、花直贡呢将比去年增加三十二万匹，大红、枣红、墨绿等色布的产量，也将增加一百零九万匹。如用这些花布和色布做妇女单衣，可以够一千一百万妇女每人一套。针织厂今年短腰花袜和绒衣裤的产量计划比去年增加十三万到二十四万打。与城市居民生活提高相适应，毛织厂今年将生产精纺毛哔叽和女式衣服呢。在日用百货和文教、医疗用品方面，今年将试制搪瓷面盆、各种口杯、手提式高压消毒器、钢琴、风琴、低音提琴等新产品。津南制革厂今年计划生产的各种球类有十七万五千多个。橡胶工厂今年供应农林和交通运输所需要的汽车外胎，将比去年增加二万零七百多条。天津油脂厂今年计划大量生产火车头上需要用的硬脂黄油、原脂黄油、碱脂黄油，供应天津、北京、上海、广州等十三个铁路管理局和各机务段的需要。造纸工厂今年计划生产油毡纸，以供应华北各地建筑工程的需要。
    天津市地方国营和公私合营轻工业工厂在编制计划时，都比较详细地研究了人民的需要和厂内设备情况。如各印染厂根据贸易部门的材料，今年计划生产的花布，除去年为群众所欢迎的各种花样外，还从北京故宫、历史博物馆等处收集了很多新花样。织染厂因市场上高级色布需要量加大，今年将增加设备和改进操作方法，以提高生产效率。橡胶二厂因今年轮胎计划产量增加，最近新安装了两台轧胶机。
    各厂在编制计划时，也注意了产、供、销的结合。大部分工厂已与贸易部门订立了供应、销售合同或协议，以保证今年生产顺利进行。
