Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 21st: During the night of terror when the US side forcibly abducted prisoners of war, a volunteer army prisoner of war, covered in mud and with his clothes torn, escaped from the Dongchang-ri camp at the risk of his life, enduring hardships and dangers to cross the military demarcation line, and was taken in by our civilian police.

This returnee is named Huang Jucheng, formerly in the Eighteenth camp in Dongchang-ri. He said that around 7:00 PM on the 20th, special agents, carrying wooden sticks, ordered the prisoners of war to walk out of the camp gate in rows of three, arm in arm. Walking in front of Huang Jucheng was the special agent squad leader Tao Kai, and behind him was the special agent platoon leader Zhang Youcai. Both of these special agents had American-made daggers hanging from their waists, urging him not to look around.

In the dim light of the night, just as the line of prisoners of war turned a corner after exiting the Bing Camp area gate, Huang Jucheng suddenly broke free from the arms tightly linked on both sides and fled in a northeast direction. Disregarding the pursuit of the special agents and the shouts of the Indian soldiers, he dropped his backpack and hat and in one breath climbed over two barbed wire fences, jumping into a small ditch that was a little over a foot deep. Fearing being discovered by US military patrols, he followed the ditch for about a mile.

Later, he reached an open area where the grass grew to waist height and heard the songs broadcast by our side coming from the left front. He thought: If I run towards our broadcast loudspeaker, I will definitely encounter the ambush posts of the US and Rhee army armed personnel, because he saw US and Rhee military armed personnel patrolling back and forth on the military demarcation line in that area during the day. So, he crawled into the grass and crawled northeast, preparing to bypass into our area. At first, his clothes were torn, then his hands and knees were worn and bleeding, and his water-soaked pants, socks, and shoes were frozen. Whenever he stopped, he shivered with cold. But hearing the "Volunteer Army March" broadcast by our side, Huang Jucheng gritted his teeth, endured the pain and cold, crawled through the thorn-filled plains and hills, and finally crawled over the military demarcation line and found our civilian police.

Huang Jucheng said that when he heard our broadcast of the "The East is Red" song at 3:00 AM on the 20th, he secretly shed tears. He also saw many people lying in bed with their eyes closed listening, and some people had tears in the corners of their eyes. After getting up, many people sat in their tents with their heads down, silent, and their faces very gloomy; they only perked up when the special agents came into the tents, so as not to be suspected of being "unstable elements." The special agent platoon leader Zhang Youcai forced the prisoners of war to sing reactionary songs to disrupt our broadcasts. Everyone sang so softly and chaotically that the special agent roared: "I know some people are disturbed by the broadcast, and some people's faces have changed. I'll note this down first and settle the score slowly after we get to Taiwan."

Huang Jucheng said that despite the threats and curses of the special agents, the prisoners of war felt extremely uncomfortable that day. No one ate the meal that was made in the morning, it was left until noon, and many people still couldn't eat it; by the evening, they still hadn't finished that meal. Huang Jucheng said, "When I walked out of the camp gate, I saw many people walking in front constantly sneaking glances north under the lights. If the Indian troops continue to supervise, eliminate the special agents, and make up for the explanation period, our people will all come back."

### 我方被俘人员黄巨成冒死逃出美方的魔掌  报告我方被俘人员渴望返回祖国的心情

    我方被俘人员黄巨成冒死逃出美方的魔掌
    报告我方被俘人员渴望返回祖国的心情
    【新华社开城二十一日电】在美方以暴力押走战俘的恐怖之夜，有一个浑身泥水、衣服都撕烂了的志愿军被俘人员从东场里营地历尽艰辛与危险逃过军事分界线，得到了我方民政警察的收容。
    这个归来人员名叫黄巨成，原在东场里第十八号营场。他说，二十日晚上约七点钟光景，特务提着木棒命令战俘三个人一排手挽手走出营场大门。在黄巨成前面走的是特务中队长陶凯，后面跟的是特务小队长张有才，这两个特务腰间都挂着美制匕首，督促他不要东张西望。
    夜色苍茫中，当战俘行列刚走出丙营区大门转弯的时候，黄巨成突然挣开两旁紧挽着的手臂，向东北方向奔逃。他不顾特务的追赶和印度兵的吼叫声，丢掉背包和帽子，一口气翻过两道铁丝网，跳进了一条有一尺多深的小河沟。为了怕被美军巡逻兵发现，他就顺着河沟走了一里路左右。
    后来他到了一片草长到腰部的开阔地带，并且听到我方广播的歌声从左前方传来。他想：如果向我方广播喇叭处跑，一定会遇见美、李军武装人员的潜伏哨，因为他在白天就看到那一带的军事分界线上有美李军武装人员来回巡逻。于是，他便钻进草丛，向东北方匍匐爬行，准备绕道进入我方地区。开始，衣服被挂破了，接着两手、两膝被磨得出血，被水浸透的裤子和鞋袜也结了冰。一停下来，便冷得浑身打战。但是听到传来的我方广播的“志愿军战歌”，黄巨成咬紧牙关，忍着疼痛和寒冷，爬过荆棘丛生的平地和山岗，终于爬过了军事分界线，找到我方民政警察。
    黄巨成说，他在二十日清晨三时听到我方广播的“东方红”歌曲时，暗暗地流了泪。他还看到很多人躺在床上闭着眼听，有的人眼角上也挂着泪水。起床以后，很多人都坐在帐篷中低头不语，脸色十分阴沉；特务钻进帐篷时他们才强振精神，以免被怀疑为“不稳分子”。特务小队长张有才迫令战俘唱反动歌子扰乱我方广播，大家唱得又低又乱，特务狂吼：“我知道有人听了广播心乱了，有人脸色都变了。我先记下一笔账，到台湾后再慢慢地算。”
    黄巨成说，尽管特务威胁叫骂，战俘在这一天心里难受极了。早上做了一顿饭，没人吃，留到中午，许多人还是吃不下；到晚上，仍然没有把这一顿饭吃完。黄巨成说：“当我走出营场大门时，我在灯光下还看到很多走在前面的人，不断地偷偷向北看。如果印度部队继续看管，清除特务，补足解释期限，我们的人都会回来的。”
