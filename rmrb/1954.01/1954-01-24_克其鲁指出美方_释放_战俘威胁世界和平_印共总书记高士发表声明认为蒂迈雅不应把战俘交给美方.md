Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 23rd: Saifuddin Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, said at a press conference in Bhopal on January 20th that the decision by the United Nations Command in Korea, headed by the United States, to "release" 22,000 prisoners of war is a serious threat to world peace and a blatant violation of the armistice agreement.

Kitchlew called on the Indian people to unite and express their opinions to defend the Korean armistice. At the same time, he warned the United States that if it continues to engage in despicable schemes to undermine the Korean armistice, it will be met with the hatred and hostility of all the Indian people. Kitchlew also condemned the delaying tactics of the United States on the issue of membership in the Korean political conference.

Dr. Kitchlew spoke about the planned US-Pakistan military alliance, saying that this planned alliance is "a new attack by the United States on the freedom and sovereignty of the Asian people." He said that the most urgent need at present is to mobilize the Indian people on the broadest scale to counter the US policy of pressure and blackmail. All the people should resist US pressure forcefully together, build friendship and unity between India and Pakistan, and insist on resolving all disputes through peaceful means.

Kitchlew said that in order to guarantee world peace, weapons of mass destruction should be banned immediately. He condemned the imperialist wars in Vietnam and Malaya and advocated that the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America be free from oppression.

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: TASS Delhi, January 22nd: CPI General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh published a statement in the newspaper. The statement reads: "The Indian Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, ignoring the protests of the Korean and Chinese Headquarters, began on January 20th to hand over 22,000 prisoners of war to the US military command. This is a dangerous action that may have serious consequences for the development of the situation in Asia."

    克其鲁指出美方“释放”战俘威胁世界和平
    印共总书记高士发表声明认为蒂迈雅不应把战俘交给美方
    【新华社新德里二十三日电】全印和平理事会主席赛福丁·克其鲁一月二十日在波保尔记者招待会上说：以美国为首的朝鲜联合国军司令部关于“释放”二万二千名战俘的决定，是对世界和平的严重威胁，并且明目张胆地违反了停战协定。
    克其鲁要求印度人民一致起来表示他们的意见，以保卫朝鲜的停战。同时，他警告美国说，假使美国继续卑鄙地图谋破坏朝鲜停战，它将遭到全体印度人民的痛恨和敌视。克其鲁同时指责美国在朝鲜政治会议成员问题上的拖延手法。
    克其鲁博士谈到策划中的美巴军事同盟说：这个计划中的联盟是“美国向亚洲人民的自由和主权所发动的新攻击”。他说：目前最迫切的需要是，向印度人民进行最广泛规模的动员，来对付美国的压力政策和讹诈。全体人民都应该一同有力地反抗美国的压力、建立印度和巴基斯坦的友谊和团结，并且坚持用和平的方法解决所有的争端。
    克其鲁说：为了保证世界和平，应该立刻禁止大规模毁灭性武器。他谴责在越南和马来亚的帝国主义战争，并主张亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲殖民地人民摆脱压迫。
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社德里二十二日讯：印度共产党总书记阿约艾·高士在报上发表声明。声明中写道：“中立国遣返委员会的印度主席不顾中朝司令部的抗议，已于一月二十日开始把二万二千名战俘移交给美军司令部，这是一种危险的行动，它可能给亚洲局势的发展带来严重的后果。”
