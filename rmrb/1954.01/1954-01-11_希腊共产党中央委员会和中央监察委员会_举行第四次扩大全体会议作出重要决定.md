The plenary session decided to abolish the Organization Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Greece and elect a three-person Secretariat of the Central Committee.

The plenary session decided that the Central Committee's Committee for the Registration of Party Members had basically completed its work and therefore decided to dissolve this committee.

After listening to the announcement by Leftéris Pappas on the statement by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Greece regarding the issue of Dimitrios Brazos, and the statement by Brazos himself, the plenary session decided to remove Brazos's status as an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party because he showed cowardice and evaded responsibility in carrying out the Party's tasks.

The Central Committee also decided to expel Brazos from the Party.

    希腊共产党中央委员会和中央监察委员会
    举行第四次扩大全体会议作出重要决定
    【新华社布拉格十日电】据保加利亚通讯社报道，自由希腊电台广播了一九五三年十二月举行的希腊共产党中央委员会和中央监察委员会第四次扩大全体会议主席团的公报。参加全体会议的有中央委员会的委员和候补委员，中央监察委员会的委员和一些领导党务工作的人员。
    会议讨论了下列问题：一、希腊爱国主义运动的发展和前景及希腊共产党的任务，报告人是希腊共产党中央委员会书记瓦西里斯·巴佐塔斯。二、希腊共产党纲领草案，报告人是希腊共产党中央委员会总书记尼科斯·萨查利阿第斯。三、组织问题。
    全体会议就第一个问题通过了决定。关于第二个问题，经广泛讨论后，全体会议在原则上通过了希腊共产党纲领草案，草案在经过某些修改并经党员讨论后，将提交第八次党代表大会最后批准。全体会议决定取消希腊共产党中央委员会组织局并选出中央委员会三人书记处。全体会议又决定修改希腊共产党党章某些条文，并责成中央委员会起草一个党章修改草案，交由全党讨论并提交第八次党代表大会批准。全体会议决定，中央党员登记委员会基本上已完成了自己的工作，故决定解散这一委员会。
    全体会议在听取了列夫特里斯·巴巴斯所宣布的希腊共产党中央委员会政治局关于季米奥斯·布拉佐斯问题的通告以及布拉佐斯本人的发言之后，决定撤消布拉佐斯的希共中央委员会候补委员资格，因为他在执行党的任务时表现懦怯和逃避责任。
    中央委员会还决定开除布拉佐斯党籍。
