The Merchandise in the American “Showcase”
Bai Yun

    The Korean War had just ended, and U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said: Eisenhower had approved an "aid" plan to "rebuild" South Korea into a so-called "showcase" of the "free world"; the "goal" of the U.S. troops stationed there was to turn South Korea into a "beautiful and attractive place." Several months have passed, so let’s take a look at what kind of merchandise is displayed in this "showcase"!

    The first thing you see is the hunger and poverty that engulf all of South Korea. According to the Syngman Rhee puppet government's "Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry," South Korea was short of more than 7.17 million *seok* of grain in 1953. The "Indian Times" reporter reported from Seoul on October 30th of last year: "The streets of Seoul are full of hungry and cold children, wandering aimlessly in search of food and shelter, picking up bread crusts in the trash cans outside the military cafeterias." Wood, the U.S. official sent to South Korea to oversee "aid" work, also admitted: "The scene in Seoul is a good picture of poverty and disaster." The number of hungry people in South Korea is huge. The September issue of "New Korea" in Pyongyang reported: "Due to the extreme difficulty of obtaining food, about half of the 1.2 million elementary school students in South Korea—720,000—are begging for food; more than 1 million war orphans are wandering the streets as beggars." South Korea's "Dongyang News Agency" also revealed that the lives of hundreds of thousands of war widows and their children in South Korea are very poor, some starved to death, and some became prostitutes. South Korea's taxes are constantly increasing due to the U.S. instigation of Syngman Rhee's frantic war preparations. According to the obviously reduced figures revealed by the Syngman Rhee puppet government's "Prime Minister" Baek Doo-jin, South Korea's taxes "account for 49 percent of the gross national product." Even so, more than half of the Syngman Rhee puppet government's 1953 budget was in deficit. In order to make up for this deficit, Syngman Rhee desperately issued counterfeit money, resulting in unprecedented price increases. According to the puppet "Bank of Korea," South Korea's price index was 100 in 1947 and reached 8,030 in 1953. But workers' wages have decreased significantly. The wage index in 1947 was 100, but it had been reduced to 27 in 1953. South Korea's civilian industry has almost completely collapsed, and American monopoly capitalists are opposed to restoring South Korea's industry in order to sell "surplus" goods. Puppet "Prime Minister" Baek Doo-jin revealed: "The American delegation believes that spending too much money on basic industries will cause inflation." As a result, South Korea's dilapidated factories are still desolate, and unemployed workers are still wandering and helpless. The Syngman Rhee puppet government admits that the number of unemployed people in South Korea has reached more than two million, and the number of semi-unemployed people is even greater.

    Accompanying hunger and poverty are disease and death. In Busan alone, about 1,600 people died on the streets last year. The puppet "Dongyang News Agency" revealed that there were 1.3 million people in South Korea suffering from open tuberculosis last year, an increase of 300,000 from the previous year. Two hundred and twenty out of every thousand babies in South Korea die, which is the highest infant mortality rate in the world.

    At the same time, the American "showcase" is filled with war and an atmosphere of political terror. Syngman Rhee's conscription teams have disrupted every household in South Korea. Many soldiers in the Rhee army were tired of the war and deserted. Syngman Rhee launched a month-long search for deserters again last December. In order to suppress the people's resistance, the U.S.-Rhee gang frantically strengthened the special agent rule in South Korea. In every corner of South Korea, Syngman Rhee has set up special agent organizations such as the so-called "police groups" and "patriotic groups" to monitor the people's every move. Therefore, the "Indian Times" reporter said in his report: South Korea has become a "country full of political police, where everyone suspects that another person is a government agent unless he proves he is not."

    Faced with this "showcase" shrouded in an atmosphere of terror, filled with hunger, poverty, disease, and death, the "Indian Times" reporter came to this conclusion: "In short, Syngman Rhee's South Korea is, in the words of a South Korean reporter, 'a place of death and dying.'" This is a typical "showcase" of the so-called "free world," and it is also the "most beautiful and attractive place" that Dulles is intoxicated with. (Attached picture)

    美国“橱窗”里的货色
    白云
    朝鲜刚刚停战，美国国务卿杜勒斯就说：艾森豪威尔已批准了一个“援助”计划，要把南朝鲜“重建”成为所谓“自由世界”的一个“陈列橱窗”；驻在那里的美军的“目标”，是要把南朝鲜变成一个“美丽诱人的地方”。几个月过去了，现在看看这个“橱窗”里究竟摆出了些什么货色吧！
    首先你看到的就是笼罩整个南朝鲜的饥饿和贫困现象。据李承晚伪政府“农林部”透露：南朝鲜在一九五三年缺粮达七百一十七万多石。“印度时报”记者去年十月三十日从汉城报道：“汉城的街上到处都是饥寒的儿童，无目的地徘徊着寻找食物和藏身的地方，在军用食堂外面的垃圾箱里拣面包皮吃。”美国派到南朝鲜去主持“援助”工作的官员伍德也承认：“汉城的景象，就是表示贫困和灾难的一幅很好的图画。”南朝鲜饥民的数目是庞大的。去年九月号平壤“新朝鲜”报道：“由于粮食的极端困难，在全南朝鲜一百二十万名小学生中，约有半数以上——七十二万名在乞食；一百万名以上的战区孤儿都流落在街头成了乞丐。”南朝鲜“东洋通讯社”也透露：南朝鲜的几十万战争寡妇和她们的子女的生活都是十分穷困的，有的饿死了，有的当了娼妓。南朝鲜的赋税，由于美国指使李承晚疯狂备战而不断增加。据李承晚伪政府“国务总理”白斗镇透露的显然缩小了的数字，南朝鲜的赋税“占国家生产总值的百分之四十九。”即使这样，李承晚伪政府一九五三年度的预算中，还有一大半是亏空。为了要弥补这个亏空，于是李承晚就拼命发伪钞，结果造成物价的空前上涨。据伪“韩国银行”透露：南朝鲜的物价指数，一九四七年为一百，一九五三年竟达八千零三十。但工人的工资却显著地减少了。一九四七年的工资指数为一百，一九五三年已减到二十七了。南朝鲜的民用工业几乎全部垮台了，而美国垄断资本家们为了推销“剩余”商品，又反对恢复南朝鲜的工业。伪“国务总理”白斗镇透露：“美国代表团认为把太多的钱花费在基本工业上，会引起通货膨胀。”结果南朝鲜残破的工厂仍是一片荒凉，失业工人仍然流落无依。李承晚伪政府承认：南朝鲜失业人数已达二百万以上，半失业的人数更多。
    伴随着饥饿和贫困的则是疾病和死亡。单在釜山市内，去年一年就有约一千六百人死在街头。伪“东洋通讯社”透露：去年南朝鲜患开放性肺结核病的有一百三十万人，比前年增加了三十万人。南朝鲜每一千个婴儿中就有二百二十个夭折，这是世界上最高的婴儿死亡率。
    同时，战争和政治恐怖气氛充满了美国“橱窗”。李承晚的抓丁队把南朝鲜弄得家家户户鸡犬不宁。李伪军中有许多士兵厌战逃亡，李承晚在去年十二月又发动了为期一个月的搜捕逃兵的运动。为了镇压人民的反抗，美李匪帮疯狂地加强南朝鲜的特务统治。在南朝鲜的每个角落里，李承晚都布置着所谓“警察小组”和“爱国小组”等特务组织，监视着人民的一举一动。因此，“印度时报”记者在他的报道中说：南朝鲜已成为一个“到处是政治警察的国家，每一个人都怀疑另外一个人是政府的特务，除非证明他不是。”
    面对着这个笼罩着恐怖气氛，充满饥饿、贫困、疾病、死亡的“橱窗”，“印度时报”记者得出了这样一个结论：“简而言之，李承晚的南朝鲜就是，用一个南朝鲜记者的话来说，‘死亡和垂死的地方’。”这就是所谓“自由世界”典型的“陈列橱窗”，也就是杜勒斯所陶醉的“最美丽诱人的地方”。（附图片）
