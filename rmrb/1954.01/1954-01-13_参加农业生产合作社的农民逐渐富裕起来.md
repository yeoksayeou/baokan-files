Farmers Participating in Agricultural Production Cooperatives Are Gradually Becoming Prosperous

    “The Cooperative's Assets Now Include My Share”
    Last year, the Yunong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiading County, Jiangsu Province, focused on increasing production and reducing costs, and rationally using labor, which greatly increased the actual income of its members. Since the establishment of the cooperative in the autumn of 1952, they have paid attention to accumulating natural fertilizers. From winter to spring, members divided the work of dredging river mud with boats and accumulating pig manure, applying more fertilizer to rice fields and some wheat and cotton fields than in previous years. After the autumn calculation, the cost reduction solely due to the accumulation and use of natural fertilizer was more than 9 million yuan compared to buying chemical fertilizers in previous years. Their surplus labor, in addition to being used for land processing, included some female members working in nearby farms and male members engaged in sideline production, earning a total of more than 10 million yuan. This overcame difficulties in production investment and living expenses and supported agricultural production. In 1952, when they were in mutual aid groups, they borrowed 4 million yuan from the bank, but last year they did not need to borrow any money at all. Ample agricultural investment, coupled with the implementation of close planting, pest control, and improved cultivation techniques, resulted in an increase in total production of more than 9,000 jin of grain and more than 1,900 jin of cotton compared to the original planned output. After the autumn harvest, the actual income of the members increased, selling 16,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The cooperative jointly bought a cow, a boat, a windmill, and various other farm tools. Member Song Yuanqi said:
  “My family has never raised a cow or bought a boat for generations. Now that I have joined the cooperative, I finally have a share in these things.”
                  (Yao Guanlin, Ling Zhengkui, Shen Bowen)
    “It’s Not Bad Luck, It’s Taking the Wrong Road”
    In the winter of 1948, Song Debao and his wife came to Zunhua County, Hebei Province, from outside the Great Wall. They were allocated more than seven mu of land and two houses, and their life was good. Unexpectedly, in the summer of 1949, both of them contracted dysentery and were unable to work for several months, the land was left barren, and they only harvested a little over five dou of grain. By the spring of the following year, they had no rice to cook, so Debao went to work as a long-term laborer. He worked hard for a year, but his income was not enough to live on, and he still owed others a debt of five dou of grain. In the winter of 1951, when the Communist Party members Guo Lan and Cui Zhiting of this village led the peasants to organize agricultural production cooperatives, Debao's wife intended to let Debao join; however, Debao mistakenly believed that he was "unlucky" and could not find sweetness even in the sweetest place. He thought that working as a laborer was more "reliable." By the winter of 1952, he owed others one shi and three dou of grain, and his life became even more difficult. At this time, the Guo Lan Agricultural Production Cooperative achieved a harvest twice as high as that of ordinary peasants. Li Rongyu, who had not had enough to eat in previous years, not only had enough grain to eat in the cooperative, but also bought household furniture worth 800,000 yuan. At this point, Song Debao understood the benefits of getting organized and becoming rich together, so he joined the cooperative with the remaining three and a half mu of land. In April 1953, when there was a food shortage, the cooperative director Guo Lan and members Li Yongfu and Yuan Yuen gave him more than one dou of corn, and the Zunhua County People's Government also issued him relief funds. Song Debao was very active in production, working a total of 147 labor days in a year and receiving eight shi of grain. In addition to repaying the one shi and three dou of grain he owed others when he was a long-term laborer, his family's life was greatly improved. He said gratefully, "If it weren't for the Communist Party and the People's Government leading us to engage in mutual aid and cooperation, I wouldn't be where I am today; now I realize that I wasn't unlucky in the past, I just took the wrong road." (Wang Lin)
    Reversing Poverty in One Year of Membership
    Yang Futang's family, a member of the Wang Chuanxiu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuncheng Town, Shanxi Province, had a total of seven members, old and young. Before joining the cooperative, although the family cultivated several mu of land, it was never enough to eat. They borrowed grain from other people's families every year and never paid it back. His father always said sadly, "It's like this every year, when will we ever get through this!" Later, Yang Futang went to drive carts and feed horses for others, earning a little more money, but it still wasn't enough to support the whole family. In the spring of 1953, when the Wang Chuanxiu Agricultural Production Cooperative was established, he quickly joined. Everyone pooled their land as shares, and various crops were planted according to the characteristics of the soil, giving full play to the potential of the land. Labor was used rationally, so that old and young could participate in production. For example, the eight mu of vegetable land in the cooperative in 1953 were planted according to the characteristics of the land. The cooperative specially dug three wells and found people who knew how to grow vegetables to manage them. As a result, the annual income was equivalent to 42 shi of wheat, several times more than the income when they were in individual hands. In individual hands, they couldn't even afford to dig a well, let alone grow so many vegetables. Yang Futang sold land before joining the cooperative because of financial difficulties. In 1953, he only had four mu of land to join the cooperative, but his family earned 440 labor days and received more than 11.3 million yuan, more than 6.1 million yuan more than in 1952. After deducting food and expenses, they had 5 million yuan left to invest in production and build houses. (Liu Zhengxiang, Zhang Feng, Zhang Fuchen)
    “This is All the Benefit of Cooperation”
    In 1953, the Hangtou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, had a bumper harvest. The average income per member was more than 1,800 jin of grain, more than 700 jin more than the average income of 1,100 jin per person in the whole village. When people asked the cooperative director, Lin Xiaogou, why they were able to increase production so much, he said, "This is all the benefit of cooperation!" First, the land is used uniformly, and different varieties of rice are planted according to the soil quality, and fertilizer is applied according to the soil quality. They planted "Five Hundred Grains" and "Three Hundred Grains" in fertile soil (such as black sandy soil), and black husk white varieties in poor soil (such as large mud soil). In order to facilitate cultivation, the cooperative exchanged ten mu of land with the farm, so that work could be done by field and by plot, saving a lot of labor. This year, the cooperative also eliminated ten field boundaries, expanding the planting area. Second, labor is used uniformly, and work is assigned according to the members' specialties. Fu Qingsong and six others were assigned to plow the fields, Wang Ziqiang and fourteen others were assigned to plant the fields, and the cooperative director, Lin Xiaogou, who understood the principles of shallow water irrigation, was specifically responsible for watching the water. Third, fertilizer is applied according to the soil conditions. Pig and cow manure is applied to lean and muddy soil, and chemical fertilizer is applied to rotten mud soil. In addition, seed selection, improved cultivation techniques, and drought resistance work were all carried out uniformly under the leadership of the cooperative, achieving remarkable results. The masses outside the cooperative praised their drought resistance work, saying, "The cooperative is like an army. Once it is mobilized, it will defeat the drought."
                                    (Zhu Xiansi)
    Preserving Harvests, Increasing Income
    The Shangquan Township area of ​​Wuan County, Hebei Province, is a cotton-producing area. Last year, it suffered from natural disasters, and the cotton production generally decreased, but the cotton of the Zhang Shulin Agricultural Production Cooperative achieved a bumper harvest. The actual income of all the members of the cooperative generally increased. For example, the net income of member Zhang Shouku was 13.37 million yuan, which was 4.415 million yuan more than that of Zhang Shubin, a single-handed peasant of the same type. In the spring of last year, it did not rain at all, and the peasants were anxious and helpless. However, the Zhang Shulin Agricultural Production Cooperative sowed 78 mu of cotton around the Grain Rain solar term within five days. Some of the cooperative's land could not be sown, so they organized more than 70 members to concentrate their efforts on drilling wells. In just a few days, they drilled two water wells and mobilized the members to carry out surprise planting. They completed the sowing half a month earlier than the individual farmers. After June, they also used the unified organization of labor in the cotton field management and weeding. Last year, many members sold their stored cotton to invest in the cooperative. For example, Zhang Shulin invested 5.5 million yuan, and Zhang Peiyun, You Tiedang, Zhang Shouku, and others all invested their unused money in the cooperative. The cooperative used this money to buy 13,000 jin of oil fertilizer and 51 sheep for year-round manure accumulation. This increased the amount of fertilizer applied to the cooperative's land, creating conditions for increased production. The peasants in Sanbaishu Village said, "Only by joining the cooperative can lean land become fertile, yields can be increased, and poverty can be transformed into wealth."

    参加农业生产合作社的农民逐渐富裕起来
    “合作社家当有了我的份”
    江苏省嘉定县裕农农业生产合作社去年抓住了增加生产、降低成本的环节，合理使用劳动力，使社员的实际收入大大增加。他们从一九五二年秋成立社起就注意积用自然肥料，从冬到春，社员分工用船罱河泥，积猪粪，在稻田和一部麦田、棉田里施肥比往年多了一倍。秋后计算，只是因积用了自然肥料，就比往年买化学肥料降低成本九百多万元。他们多余的劳动力，除了用于土地加工外，有一部分女社员还在附近农场做工，男社员进行副业生产，共得一千多万元。这就克服了生产投资和生活上的困难，支持了农业生产。他们一九五二年在互助组时还贷了银行四百万元款，去年就完全没有贷款。充裕的农业投资，加上实行密植，治虫，改进耕作技术等，使全社比原订计划产量增产了粮食九千多斤，棉花一千九百多斤。秋后社员实际收入增加了，卖给国家一万六千斤余粮，社里伙买了一头牛，一只船，一部风车，及其他各种农具。社员宋元其说：
  “我家世代没养过一条牛，没买过一只船，现在参加了合作社，这些东西总算也有了我的份。”
                  （姚冠林　凌正奎　沈博文）
    “不是命苦，是走错了路”
    一九四八年冬天，宋德宝两口子从长城外来到河北省遵化县。他们分到了七亩多地和两间房，日子过得很美。没想到一九四九年夏天，两口子都闹起了痢疾，一连几个月没有干活，地也荒了，只收了五斗多粮食。到第二年春天种地时，已经没米下锅了，德宝就去当长工。他辛苦一年，收入却不够生活，还欠下了人家五斗粮的账。一九五一年冬天，这村的共产党员郭岚、崔治廷等人领导农民组织农业生产合作社时，德宝媳妇打算让德宝参加；可是德宝错误地认为自己“命苦”，走到蜜山也甜不了，还是扛活吃饭“牢靠”。到一九五二年冬天，他欠了别人一石三斗粮，生活更加困难了。这时，郭岚农业生产合作社得到了比一般农民高一倍的丰收，往年不够吃的李荣玉，在社里分得的粮食不光够吃，还买了价值八十万元的日用家具。这时，宋德宝明白了组织起来大家富裕的好处，就带着剩下的三亩半地入了社。在一九五三年四月青黄不接的时候，社主任郭岚和社员李永富、袁玉恩送给了他一斗多玉米，遵化县人民政府又发给了他救济款。宋德宝在生产上很积极，一年共做了一百四十七个劳动日，分了八石粮。他除还了扛活时欠别人的一石三斗粮以外，全家生活大大改善。他感激地说：“若不是共产党和人民政府领导搞互助合作，我不会有今天；现在认识到我过去不是命苦，是走错了路。”（王林）
    入社一年就扭转了穷困局面
    山西省运城镇王传秀农业生产合作社社员杨福堂家里，共有老小七口人。入社以前，家里虽然种着几亩地，可是总是不够吃。年年借别人家的粮食，年年还不清。他父亲总是伤心地说：“年年就是这个样子，日子熬到多会才算！”后来杨福堂给别人去赶车喂马，赚的钱多一些，也还是顾不住全家。一九五三年春天王传秀农业生产合作社成立了，他就赶快加入。大家把土地入了股，统一按土质特点，分种各种作物，发挥了土地的潜力，劳力合理使用，使老少都能参加生产。比如一九五三年社里的八亩菜地就是按土地的特点种的，社里专门打了三眼井，找会种菜的人管理，结果一年收入折麦四十二石，比在个人手里时的收入多好几倍。在个人手里，光打井就打不起，更无力种那么多菜。杨福堂入社前因为生活困难卖了地，一九五三年只有四亩地入社，但他家里的人得了劳动日四百四十个，分了一千一百三十多万元，比一九五二年多收入六百一十多万元，除了吃用，还剩下五百万元准备投入生产和修盖房子。（刘正祥　张烽　张辅辰）
    “这都是合作的好处”
    一九五三年浙江开化县航头农业生产合作社大丰收，社员每人平均收入折谷一千八百多斤，比全村每人平均收入一千一百斤多了七百多斤。人们问该社社长林小苟为什么能够这样增产时，他就说：“这都是合作的好处呀！”第一、统一使用土地，按土质种植不同品种的稻子，按土质施肥。他们在土质肥的田（如黑沙土）里就种“五百粒”“三百粒”种，土质差的田（如大泥土）就种乌壳白种。为了耕作方便，该社和农场调换了十亩田，使干活都能按畈按片的去作，节省很多劳力；社内土地今年还取消了十条地界，扩大了种植面积。第二、统一使用劳力，按社员的特长统一分工，抽出傅青松等六人犁田，王子强等十四人种田，社长林小苟懂得浅水灌溉的道理，就专门负责看水。第三、因地施肥，在瘦田大泥田多施猪、牛粪，烂污田多施化学肥料。此外，选种，改进耕作技术，抗旱工作，全社社员都在社的领导下统一进行，获得显著成绩。社外群众赞扬他们的抗旱工作说：“合作社像队伍一样，一出动就把旱灾打倒了。”
                                    （朱贤嗣）
    保住收成，增加收入
    河北省武安县上泉乡一带是产棉区，去年受了自然灾害，一般的棉花都减产了，就是张书林农业生产合作社的棉花得到了丰收。全社社员的实际收入普遍增加。像社员张守库纯收入一千三百三十七万元，比同类户单干农民张书斌多收四百四十一万五千元。去年春天播种时，一点雨也不下，农民干着急没办法。可是张书林农业生产合作社却在谷雨前后五天，播种了七十八亩棉花。社里有一部分地不能播种，他们就组织了七十多个社员集中力量打井，不多几天就打好了两眼水井，发动社员突击点种。他们比单干农民提前半月完成了播种。六月以后，在进行棉花田间管理和锄草中也发挥了统一组织劳力的作用。去年不少社员把存着的棉花卖掉向社投资，像张书林投资五百五十万元，张佩云、尤铁党、张守库等都把用不着的钱投到社里了。社里用这些钱买了一万三千斤油肥，又买了五十一只羊，进行常年积肥。使全社的土地施肥量都增加了，给增产创造了条件。三柏树村的农民说：“只有入了社，瘦地才能变肥，产量才能提高，才能由穷变富。”
