Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 15th. The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the Political Conference issued the following communique:

    On January 15th, the second meeting of the liaison secretaries of both sides was held. Due to the U.S. side's insistence on its delaying policy of opposing the unconditional resumption of bilateral talks, today's meeting continued to make no progress.

    At today's meeting, our side's secretary reiterated our side's reasonable demand for immediate and unconditional resumption of the meeting, emphasizing that in order to promptly convene the Political Conference and meet the desire of the people of the world to ease tensions, the governments of Korea and China advocate the immediate resumption of bilateral talks. In three notifications to Mr. Young of the U.S. side, our representative clearly stated that the liaison secretaries of both sides should discuss and determine the date for the resumption of the meeting, so that the bilateral talks can be quickly resumed. Our side believes that the disputes in past meetings should not hinder the resumption of bilateral talks, because these disputes are much less important compared to the resumption of bilateral talks and the convening of the Political Conference. Since the only issue at present is to agree on the date of resumption, and this issue is easy to resolve, there is no need for the liaison secretaries' meeting to hold an administrative meeting. Our side still suggests January 16th as the date for the resumption of the meeting. If the other side disagrees, they can propose another date for the resumption, and our side is willing to listen to the other side's opinions.

    The U.S. side's secretary stubbornly insisted on revising the past meeting records as a condition for the resumption of the meeting, and insisted on its proposal for the liaison secretaries' meeting to hold an administrative meeting. In order to conceal its unreasonable position, the U.S. side's secretary even falsely accused our side of not making constructive efforts, resulting in the failure of the bilateral talks to achieve results.

    Our side's secretary immediately pointed out that since the beginning of the bilateral talks, the Korean and Chinese sides have always acted in the spirit of sincere consultation, and have repeatedly put forward constructive suggestions in order to quickly arrange the convening of the Political Conference. The entire process from the beginning to the interruption of the bilateral talks has clearly shown who should bear the serious responsibility for undermining the bilateral talks and obstructing the convening of the Political Conference, and who has truly shown the sincerity of hoping to quickly convene the Political Conference. However, past disputes should not hinder the resumption of bilateral talks, and the current issue is to quickly resume bilateral talks and immediately agree on the date of resumption.

    The U.S. side's secretary, however, insisted that the resumption of the meeting must be subject to conditions, and refused to agree on the date of resumption. This attitude of the other side shows that the other side is clearly not yet prepared to work with our side to agree on the date of resumption and resume bilateral talks as soon as possible, but instead is trying to re-ignite past disputes in order to obstruct the resumption of the talks. Therefore, our side's secretary had no choice but to state that if the other side insists on this attitude, the liaison secretaries' meeting cannot achieve results. In order to facilitate the other side to carefully consider our side's proposal, our side suggested that the liaison secretaries' meeting adjourn until January 18th (next Monday) to meet again. The U.S. side agreed.

    双方联络秘书会议因美方无理拖延仍无进展
    我方重申立即无条件恢复双方会谈的主张
    【新华社开城十五日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    一月十五日，双方联络秘书会议举行第二次会议，由于美方坚持其反对无条件恢复双方会谈的拖延政策，今日会议继续无进展。
    在今日会上，我方秘书重申我方立即无条件复会的合理主张，强调指出：为了迅速召开政治会议满足世界人民缓和紧张局势的愿望，朝中两国政府主张立即恢复双方会谈。我方代表在致美方杨格先生的三次通知中，都明确说明双方联络秘书应该讨论和确定的是复会的日期，以便双方会谈得以迅速恢复。我方认为双方在过去会议中的争论，不应该妨害双方会谈的恢复，因为这些争论与恢复双方会谈和召开政治会议相比较，其重要性要小得多，既然当前唯一的问题是商定复会的日期，而这个问题又是很容易解决的，因此双方联络秘书会议没有举行行政性会议的必要。我方仍建议一月十六日为复会的日期，如对方不同意，可另提一复会日期，我方愿意听取对方的意见。
    美方秘书仍然固执地主张修改过去会议记录作为复会的条件，并坚持其双方联络秘书会议举行行政性会议的主张。为了掩饰其无理立场，美方秘书竟反指我方未作建设性的努力，以致双方会谈未能获致结果。
    我方秘书当即指出：自从双方会谈开始以来，朝中方面始终本着诚意协商的精神，一再提出建设性的建议以求迅速安排政治会议的召开。双方会淡至中断时止的整个过程，已经清楚地说明了究竟谁应该担当破坏双方会谈、阻挠政治会议召开的严重责任，而谁才是真正表现了希望迅速召开政治会议的诚意。但过去的争论不应该妨害双方会谈的恢复，目前的问题是迅速恢复双方会谈，立即商定复会日期。
    美方秘书却仍坚持复会必须附有条件，拒绝商定复会日期。对方这种态度表明对方显然还不准备与我方共同努力商定复会日期，早日恢复双方会谈，却反而力图重行引起过去的争论，以阻挠会谈的恢复。因此我方秘书最后不得不表示：如果对方坚持这种态度，双方联络秘书会议是不能获致结果的。为了便利对方慎重考虑我方的主张，我方建议双方联络秘书会议休会至一月十八日（下星期一）再会晤，美方同意。
