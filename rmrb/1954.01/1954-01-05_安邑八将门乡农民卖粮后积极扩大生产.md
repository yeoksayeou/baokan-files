    An邑 Eight Generals' Gate Township Farmers Actively Expand Production After Selling Grain

    After selling a large amount of surplus grain to the state, the farmers of Eight Generals' Gate Township in An邑 County, Shanxi Province, have been using the money they earned from selling grain to purchase livestock, farm tools, and other items to invest in expanding production. Farmers deposit money they don't need for the time being in state banks.

    Recently, the farmers of Eight Generals' Gate Township have been educated on the general line of the state's transition period, and their patriotism and socialist awareness have been greatly enhanced. They are all enthusiastically selling surplus grain to support national construction. In less than five days, the township overfulfilled its grain purchase plan. In order to produce more grain to support the country's socialist industrialization, the farmers unanimously demanded to expand production and increase yields. At present, the farmers of this township are developing and consolidating mutual aid and cooperation organizations, while also expanding production investment, purchasing livestock and farm tools, and raising domestic animals to accumulate fertilizer. Farmer Li Molai used the money from selling grain to buy a horse and deposited the remaining one million yuan in the People's Bank. Duan Tiemao bought a horse and twelve sheep, and deposited 700,000 yuan in the People's Bank. The whole township has added three good horses, three heads of cattle, one donkey, twelve sheep, and one cart. At the same time, many farmers have deposited their surplus funds in state banks. On December 7th of last year alone, 51 households deposited 45.5 million yuan in the bank. At present, the farmers throughout the township have high production enthusiasm, are carrying out winter production, and are brewing plans to order spring production. (Dang Peiji Duan Wenbin)

    安邑八将门乡农民卖粮后积极扩大生产
    山西省安邑县八将门乡农民在把大批余粮卖给国家以后，纷纷用卖粮得到的款子购买牲口、农具等，投资扩大生产。暂时用不着的钱，农民就存入国家银行。
    八将门乡农民最近受到了国家过渡时期总路线的教育，爱国主义和社会主义的觉悟大为提高，都踊跃出售余粮，支援国家建设。全乡在不到五天的时间内，就超额完成了购粮计划。农民们为了多打粮食支援国家社会主义工业化，一致要求扩大生产，提高产量。现在这个乡的农民一面发展和巩固互助合作组织，同时更扩大生产投资，购买牲口、农具，饲养家畜积肥。农民李磨来用卖粮款买了一匹马，下余的一百万元存入了人民银行。段铁毛买了一匹马、十二只绵羊，在人民银行存款七十万元。全乡已添好马三匹、耕牛三头、驴一头、羊十二只、大车一辆。同时，许多农民将余款存入了国家银行，仅去年十二月七日一天，就有五十一户向银行存款四千五百五十万元。目前，全乡农民生产情绪很高，正在进行冬季生产，并酝酿订春天的生产计划。（党佩吉  段文彬）
