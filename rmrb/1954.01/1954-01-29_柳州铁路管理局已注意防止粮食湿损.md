The Liuzhou Railway Bureau Pays Attention to Preventing Grain from Moisture Damage

Letter from the Liuzhou Railway Bureau: The People's Daily published a report on our bureau's serious business accidents on page two on November 24th of last year. We now report the results of the inspection as follows:

From April of last year, the amount of grain transported by our bureau suddenly increased, and most of it was transported over long distances. By the end of June last year, our bureau had received more than 260 "business records" of wet and damaged grain from various arrival stations. Feeling the seriousness of the problem, we convened a meeting of business personnel from major grain transportation stations throughout the bureau to analyze the causes of the accidents and study preventive measures. At that time, in order to alert all employees, we calculated the total number of wet and damaged grain bags recorded in the "business records" to be 13,541, estimating the value at 1.7 billion yuan based on the total loss. In reality, 400 bags of grain were moldy, 1,780 bags had sprouted, and 11,361 bags had minor moisture damage. As of now, the amount of compensation claimed by cargo owners for railway responsibility is more than 39 million yuan. The main reason for the moisture damage to the grain is that our bureau did not pay enough attention to grain transportation work, lacking proper arrangements before the grain was shipped, and failing to conduct effective supervision and inspection after shipment. According to regulations, before loading grain onto wagons, the roof of the tarpaulin car must be checked for leaks, and the bottom of the open car must be checked for water accumulation. However, some stations, simply to rush tasks, did not promptly repair leaking tarpaulin cars or open cars with damp bottoms, nor did they mobilize cargo owners to use rice husks to line the bottom of the cars before loading the grain, leading to moisture damage. Some freight car tarpaulins were of poor quality or not tightly covered, causing rainwater to seep into the car and cause the grain to become damp and sprout. Some station staff also lacked a serious and responsible attitude towards state property, failing to inspect poorly packaged or already deteriorated grain before transport. They even allowed it to be loaded into the car after problems were identified, as long as the cargo owner signed to acknowledge that the railway was not responsible. This further aggravated the mold and deterioration of the grain and wasted transportation capacity.

In response to the above shortcomings, our bureau has designated the prevention of business accidents as one of the central tasks of the transportation department since the third quarter of last year, improved the system of holding accident review meetings, and implemented work systems through quality inspections and the convening of experience exchange meetings in sections. We issued loading and unloading piece counters to some grain transportation stations (to prevent accidents involving mismatched quantities), added temporary freight sheds, and adjusted and reissued moisture-proof sleepers and moisture-proof tarpaulins to various stations. We also held three training courses for business personnel to improve the ideological understanding and professional skills of station freight personnel, promoted Yang Maolin's advanced working methods in Nanning and Liuzhou, and frequently sent cadres to conduct on-site inspections of moisture-proof equipment and specifically help them establish work systems. In addition, we also reported the specific facts of accidents caused by poor management on the part of the cargo owners to the Central South Financial Committee and the Guangxi Provincial Financial Committee, and repeatedly urged various stations to mobilize cargo owners to strengthen moisture-proof equipment. Through the above series of measures, our bureau's general moisture damage accidents and other accidents were greatly reduced in the third quarter of last year. In December last year, our bureau held the second business accident meeting of the whole bureau in sections, and incorporated the elimination of mismatched quantities and moisture damage accidents into the technical organization measures for the first quarter of this year. A meeting of business personnel from the entire railway is scheduled to be held in January this year to exchange experiences in preventing accidents.

### 柳州铁路管理局已注意防止粮食湿损

　　柳州铁路管理局已注意防止粮食湿损
    柳州铁路管理局来信：去年十一月二十四日人民日报第二版刊载了我局商务事故严重的消息，现把检查结果报告于下：
    从去年四月份起，我局运输粮食的数量突然增加，并且其中大部分运距很长。去年六月底，我局收到各到达站寄来湿损粮谷的“商务记录”二百六十余份，感到问题严重，就召集全局主要粮运站商务人员开会，分析事故发生原因，并研究防止对策。当时，为了引起全体员工的警惕，我们把“商务记录”所载粮谷湿损总数一万三千五百四十一包，按全部遭受损失计算，估计值十七亿元。实际上，粮食霉坏的四百包，发芽的一千七百八十包，湿损轻微的一万一千三百六十一包；截至现在，货主认为是铁路责任要求赔偿的款项为三千九百余万元。造成粮食湿损的主要原因是我局对粮食运输工作重视不够，在粮食起运前既缺乏适当的布置，起运后也没有进行有效的督促和检查。按照规定，在粮食装车前，必须对篷车车顶是否漏雨，敞车车底是否有积水，加以检查；但有的车站单纯为了赶任务，对漏雨篷车和车底潮湿的敞车没有及时补修或动员货主利用稻壳衬垫车底，就装上粮食，以致发生粮食湿损事件。有些货车篷布不好或苫盖不密，以致雨水渗入车内，使粮食受潮发芽。还有一些车站工作人员对国家财产缺乏认真负责的精神，对包装不良或早已变质的粮食在承运前也不加检查；甚至检查出问题后，只要货主签字承认不由铁路负责，也就允许装入车内。这就使粮食霉烂变质情况更形严重，并且造成运输力的浪费。
    针对以上各项缺点，我局自去年第三季度起将防止商务事故定为运输部门的中心工作之一，健全了召开事故检讨会的制度，通过质量检查、分段召开交流经验大会的办法来贯彻工作制度；给某些粮运站发装卸计件器（防止件数不符事故），添设临时货棚，调整和增发了各站防湿枕木和防湿篷布；开办三期商务人员训练班，以提高车站货运人员思想认识及业务水平，在南宁、柳州两地推行了杨茂林先进工作方法，并经常派遣干部深入现场检查防湿设备及具体帮助他们建立工作制度。此外，我们还将货主方面经营不善而造成事故的具体事实向中南财委及广西省财委反映，并一再督促各站动员货主加强防湿设备。通过上述一系列措施，我局去年第三季度的一般湿损事故和其他事故都大为减少。去年十二月，我局又分段召开了全局第二次商务事故会议，并将消灭件数不符及湿损事故订入今年第一季度技术组织措施。并定于今年一月份召开全路商务人员会议，相互交流防止事故的经验。
