Lenin's political, philosophical, historical, and economic works are unparalleled examples of creatively developing science and adhering to the Party spirit of science. Soviet science has made enormous progress in studying the laws of natural and social development by applying Lenin's dialectics. Based on Lenin's theory of the development and distribution of productive forces, the Soviet Academy of Sciences has conducted and is conducting complex research work on the country's natural resources, comprehensively studying minerals, plants, and animals, climate and soil, in order to scientifically assist the development of agriculture and transportation. Nesmeyanov said: The victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the socialist construction in the various People's Democratic countries vividly demonstrate the effective power of the socialist construction program formulated by Lenin based on the laws of social development and the great power of Marxism-Leninism. The image of the great Lenin and his revolutionary activities inspire the Soviet people to engage in the construction of a communist society.

	The conference also heard reports such as "Lenin—Master of Creative Marxism," "Lenin—Theoretician of Scientific Communism," and "The Significance of Lenin's Work 'The Development of Capitalism in Russia' to Historical Science."
