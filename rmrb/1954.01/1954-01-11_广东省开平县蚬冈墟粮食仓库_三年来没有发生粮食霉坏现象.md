The Shingang Market Grain Depot in Kaiping County, Guangdong Province
Has Not Experienced Grain Mold in Three Years

    The Shingang Market Grain Depot in Kaiping County, Guangdong Province, has not experienced grain mold or other similar problems for three years. The Grain Bureau of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government has commended it and is promoting its experience throughout the province's grain storage departments.
    The Shingang Market Depot in Kaiping County was originally renovated and expanded from old bus stations, ancestral halls, and civilian houses. The warehouses were scattered, the equipment was poor, and the depot capacity was small, with few staff, which made the work difficult. However, through the active efforts of the depot staff, none of the more than 80 million jin of public grain received and stored by the depot since the summer harvest of 1950 has suffered from mold or other losses.
    The reason why the Shingang Depot has achieved such success in grain storage is that, in addition to being able to win and rely on the leadership of the local CCP Party Committee and government, and creating favorable conditions for storage work by signing "Public Grain Delivery Contracts" with rural farmers' associations to ensure that the quality of incoming public grain meets standards, they mainly did the following:
    First, the Shingang Depot attached great importance to mobilizing and relying on the local masses to carry out grain storage work. In order to protect the safety of the grain, the Shingang Depot mobilized and educated the militia. They helped the militia guarding the depot solve problems in their lives through the local government, and helped the militia study culture and politics, gradually increasing their awareness and enthusiasm for protecting the depot. The militia guarding the depot all regarded the depot as their own home. In addition to their regular guard duty, they also voluntarily helped the depot when public grain was being stored or when there were other urgent tasks. The depot staff actively participated in local drought prevention, pest control, and other work, so they had a harmonious relationship with local agencies and established deep feelings with the local masses, who were very concerned about the depot. In 1951, when floods rose sharply, local workers, farmers, and government cadres, under the leadership of the local Party Committee and government, quickly organized a flood prevention and rescue team, and in less than an hour helped the depot move 50,000 jin of grain to a safe place.
    Second, the Shingang Depot established and implemented various scientific working systems. The main working systems of the Shingang Depot are: (1) A system of designated persons responsible for specific tasks: Usually, the warehouses are managed separately, with each person responsible for their own area; when there are rush jobs, everyone works together to complete the task. (2) A regular inspection system: The grain temperature and grain quality are checked regularly every day. The inside and outside of the warehouse and the bottom layer of the warehouse are cleaned regularly, and the bottom of the warehouse is cleaned once a week. They also have relatively good methods for preventing insect infestation, such as when new grain is put into storage, the old grain is sifted, and then the new and old grain are stored separately or isolated; the coarse bran is disinfected, the powdered bran, insect eggs, and impurities are sifted out, and "666" pesticide powder is sprayed before being used as padding at the bottom of the pile to avoid the breeding of pests.
    In addition, the depot staff were able to persist in political and professional studies, thereby improving their work enthusiasm and professional level.

### 广东省开平县蚬冈墟粮食仓库  三年来没有发生粮食霉坏现象

    广东省开平县蚬冈墟粮食仓库
    三年来没有发生粮食霉坏现象
    广东省开平县蚬冈墟粮食仓库三年来没有发生粮食霉坏等现象，广东省人民政府粮食厅已加以表扬；并在全省粮食保管部门推广它的经验。
    开平县蚬冈墟仓库原是借用旧汽车站、祠堂和民房等改修扩建的，库房分散，设备条件不好，同时仓库容量较小，干部也少，工作中有许多困难。但是经过仓库干部积极努力，从一九五○年夏征起，这个仓库所经收保管的八千多万斤公粮，都没有遭受霉坏等损失。
    蚬冈仓库粮食保管工作所以能有这样的成绩，除了他们能争取和依靠当地中共党委和政府的领导，通过和乡农民协会订立“送交公粮交接合同”使入库公粮的质量合乎标准，为保管工作创造了一定的有利条件外，主要是因为作好了以下几项工作。
    首先，蚬冈仓库很重视发动和依靠当地群众进行粮食保管工作。为了保护粮食的安全，蚬冈仓库作了发动和教育民兵的工作。他们通过当地政府，帮助护仓民兵解决生活上的问题，帮助民兵学习文化和政治，逐渐提高了民兵的觉悟和护仓的积极性。护仓民兵都把仓库当成自己的家，除经常护仓工作外，遇到公粮入库或有其他紧急任务，还主动到仓库帮忙。仓库干部平时主动参加当地的防旱抗旱、除虫等工作，因此和当地各机关关系很融洽，和当地群众也建立了深厚的感情，群众都很关心仓库。一九五一年洪水暴涨时，当地的工人、农民、机关干部在当地党委、政府领导下，迅速组织了防洪抢救队，不到一个小时，就帮助仓库将五万斤粮食搬运到妥善的地方。
    其次，蚬冈仓库建立并贯彻了各种科学的工作制度。蚬冈仓库主要的工作制度是：（一）专人专责制：平时分仓保管，各负专责；遇到有突击性工作，大家动手共同完成任务。（二）定期检查制度：每天定时检查粮食温度，检查粮食质量。经常打扫仓库内外及仓库的底层，每周清理仓底一次。他们防止生虫等的办法也比较好，如新粮入库时，将陈粮筛一遍，然后将新粮和陈粮分仓或隔离保管；将大糠经过消毒，筛去粉糠、虫卵、杂质，并用“六六六”药粉喷射后垫囤底，以避免虫害滋生。
    另外，仓库干部能坚持政治学习和业务学习，因而提高了工作积极性和业务水平。
