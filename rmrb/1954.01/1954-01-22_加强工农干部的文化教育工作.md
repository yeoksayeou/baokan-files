Strengthening Cultural and Educational Work for Worker-Peasant Cadres

Under the guidance of the general line for the transition period, our country has entered the second year of the first Five-Year Plan. With the progress of large-scale economic construction, the nation urgently needs a large number of construction cadres and technical personnel, especially worker-peasant cadres with high political consciousness and certain cultural and scientific knowledge, to serve as the leading backbone of construction. In recent years, all parts of the country have made significant achievements in training cadres and have accumulated considerable experience, but there are also many shortcomings and problems. Although we have a large number of worker-peasant cadres tempered through practical struggle, their general cultural level is relatively low, making it difficult for them to further study political theory and science and technology. This seriously affects the improvement and training of cadres, making the cadre force incompatible with the needs of national construction. According to statistics from September of last year, over half of the cadres in the country (excluding military cadres) had not reached junior high school level, and a small number were even illiterate. A large number of worker-peasant cadres, due to their lack of culture, find it difficult to improve their political level and professional competence, and feel unable to cope with new tasks. Failure to change this situation will inevitably cause serious losses to the cause of national construction. Therefore, how to systematically improve the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres to cultivate the backbone of various construction undertakings has become an urgent and important task for the Party and the government.

In response to this situation, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Instruction on Strengthening the Cultural and Educational Work of Cadres." Leading organs of Party committees, governments, industrial and mining enterprises, and mass organizations at all levels must carefully study and discuss this instruction and earnestly formulate plans for its implementation.

To effectively carry out this work, leading comrades of Party and government organs, mass organizations, and industrial and mining enterprises in all localities must first fully recognize the great significance of cadre cultural education work for our country's socialist construction. The Central Instruction points out: "To train and promote a large number of worker-peasant cadres and systematically improve their political, cultural, and professional levels, making them the backbone of various construction undertakings, is a major political and organizational task in implementing the Party's general line for the transition period." However, many leading comrades still do not attach enough importance to this major task. Some believe that cadre cultural education work is only the concern of personnel and education departments, and that Party committees and administrative leaders can ignore it; or they only make empty calls without providing specific guidance or earnestly resolving urgent problems. Some are unwilling to transfer cadres from their own organs or factories and mines for study, nor do they pay attention to organizing cadres to study in their work posts, merely using cadres without paying attention to their training. They adopt a perfunctory attitude towards the enrollment work of various cadre cultural schools, unwilling to seriously transfer higher quality cadres who should be cultivated to enroll. Some, faced with the difficulty of a lack of cadres, do not actively take effective measures to systematically train and promote them, but simply wait for dispatch from higher levels and support from other regions. Some even believe that worker-peasant cadres are ineffective, failing to see their political qualities, development prospects, and their active role in their work. In organizing study, some do not adequately care for guards, communicators, and the like. Many guards and communicators have participated in the revolution for many years, are loyal, and actively seek to study and improve themselves. Once they study and improve, they will become excellent cadres of tomorrow. Indeed, there have been many such examples. Therefore, it is completely wrong to adopt an indifferent attitude towards these comrades' study. It is also wrong to fail to distinguish between priorities and absorb only service personnel and nannies into schools, without effectively solving the difficulties of cadre study and earnestly organizing cadre study, thus depriving a large number of worker-peasant cadres who urgently require and must study of the opportunity to learn culture.

The basic reason for the above deviations is, first of all, that some comrades lack a class viewpoint and do not understand that building socialism requires the leadership backbone of the working class itself, and that systematically improving the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres and industrial workers is an important step in cultivating the leadership backbone of the working class itself. Lenin pointed out in 1922: "The main thing we lack now is culture, technical skills in management... The New Economic Policy fully guarantees us the possibility of building a socialist economic base in economic and political terms. The problem 'merely' lies in the cultural strength of the proletariat and its vanguard." Stalin also pointed out in 1931, when discussing the six new conditions for ensuring the development of Soviet industry, that one of them was that "the working class should create its own technical intelligentsia." He pointed out that, because the Soviet regime had created a new industrial base, it was necessary "to have three or five times more engineering and technical personnel and industrial command personnel," and that these personnel were none other than "people who can understand the policies of our working class, can comprehend these policies, and are determined to sincerely implement them." That is to say, the working class should create its own technical intelligentsia. Our country also needs to create a large number of production management cadres and production technical cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds as the backbone for uniting the vast number of technical personnel and building socialism. But now a large number of worker-peasant cadres still lack culture, so it is necessary to systematically improve their cultural level. Chairman Mao said as early as the rectification campaign in 1942: "Our Party Central Committee now emphasizes the need for worker-peasant cadres to study culture, because after learning culture, they can study politics, military affairs, and economics." Therefore, we must attach great importance to cadre cultural education work.

Another reason for the above deviations is that some comrades lack an overall view and long-term plans. They only see the immediate local interests and not the long-term overall interests, and often fail to adequately consider the long-term prospects of construction and the need for construction personnel in the future. When they encounter the problem of the incompatibility between the cadre force and construction tasks, they only treat the symptom rather than systematically solving the problem from the root. We hope that the leading comrades of Party committees, governments, mass organizations, and industrial and mining enterprises at all levels, based on the Central Instruction, thoroughly criticize and correct various incorrect ideas, in order to effectively promote the cultural education work of worker-peasant cadres.

Secondly, there must be a clear and consistent understanding of the purpose and teaching principles of cadre cultural education. In the past, inconsistent opinions on this issue led to confusion in areas such as school systems, curricula, and teaching materials. For example, some emphasized focusing on higher education, requiring the cultivation of worker-peasant cadres into culturally well-rounded talents. Consequently, in terms of school system and curriculum, some places even stipulated twelve years, requiring the completion of all courses in ordinary middle schools; in teaching, they advocated "balanced development" and "keeping pace," learning from ordinary schools, and demanding everything be standardized, opposing accelerated programs. Some simply emphasized practicality, only learning one or two courses most closely related to work or technology, requiring graduation in one or two years, eager for quick results, neglecting the learning of basic culture, and ignoring the interrelationship of various knowledge and the systematic nature of science. Some did not have clear goals, and in teaching, they did not set a pace, did not ask about results, and learned as they went. The Central Instruction provides a correct solution to this problem. The Instruction says: "The purpose of carrying out cadre cultural education at present is to gradually raise the cultural level of cadres with lower cultural levels to the equivalent of higher elementary school or even junior high school graduation, so as to effectively study political theory, delve into their professions, and complete various work tasks; at the same time, to enable some worker-peasant cadres to have the conditions to pursue further studies." Regarding teaching issues, the Central Instruction also clearly points out: "We must adopt accelerated and practical teaching principles." The cultural education of worker-peasant cadres must be appropriately linked to practical work to suit the characteristics of worker-peasant cadres. Generally speaking, worker-peasant cadres have relatively rich experience in life and struggle, a relatively high degree of political awareness, a stronger understanding ability, and an urgent desire to learn, so they can quickly learn culture; but they are busier with work, have greater mobility, and have less time that is also more fragmented, so their learning cannot and should not be required to be as regular as that of ordinary schools. Courses must be streamlined and concentrated, not every subject needs to be offered. The study period should not be too long, nor should it be too short, to avoid being fast without success. It is necessary to avoid detached and one-sided emphasis on standardization, but also to appropriately stipulate a certain pace and system to avoid drifting. In terms of the organizational form of teaching, it should also be handled according to actual needs and possible conditions. In addition to the general cadre force, which should focus on after-work study, in order to meet the urgent needs of various construction projects, Party, government, and enterprise leading organs at all levels should, according to local specific conditions, systematically and with emphasis transfer industrial workers and worker-peasant cadres above the level of rural district committee secretary and district head off the job in batches, under the principle of not hindering production and work, to organize them to study intensively, so that they can master basic cultural knowledge in a relatively short period of time, thereby further studying politics and professional work, and gradually become the backbone of construction.

Third, the key to doing a good job in cadre cultural education work lies in leadership. In the past, in addition to ideological and policy issues, there were also problems in organizational leadership that must be effectively resolved. The most important of these is the lack of unified leadership and specialized management agencies. In various places, some are managed by the Party committee, some by the Cultural Committee, some by the Education Department (Bureau, Section), some by the Personnel Bureau (Office, Section), some by the Illiteracy Elimination Committee, some by the trade union, and some are managed by several organs at the same time. While some of them are well managed, most have not been seriously managed, or everyone manages but in fact no one manages. As a result, work lacks planning and inspection, experiences are not summarized, shortcomings and deviations cannot be overcome in a timely manner, and when encountering difficulties and problems, they often pass the buck to each other, which cannot be resolved for a long time, causing the work to drift. This situation must be changed quickly. Cadre cultural education work must be under unified leadership, and specialized management agencies must be set up to manage it properly. This mainly relies on Party committees at all levels to take practical responsibility for leadership, organize the forces of all parties, implement the central policies, formulate realistic and feasible plans, earnestly supervise and inspect, overcome shortcomings, summarize experiences, and solve urgent problems. The so-called unified leadership does not mean that the Party committee takes care of everything, big or small, but rather unifies the policy and unifies the plan. Under the unified policy and plan, various departments and localities manage at different levels. All localities should grasp the principle of "unified leadership, separate management" and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of various departments and localities. It is necessary to set up specialized management agencies for cadre cultural education, or designate a certain agency and specific personnel to specifically take responsibility. This specialized management agency should be established step by step according to local conditions, based on the central instructions and combined with the specific conditions of the local area, so that there is a specific person in charge of the matter, and the phenomenon of no one being in charge no longer occurs. Among the specific problems that urgently need to be solved at present are the establishment and funding issues. The Central Instruction has made clear provisions on this point. Party committees and governments at all levels, especially the leading organs of industrial and mining enterprises, must seriously solve them in conjunction with the relevant departments, based on this instruction and combined with the specific conditions of the unit.

    加强工农干部的文化教育工作
    我国在过渡时期总路线的照耀下进入了第一个五年计划建设的第二年。随着大规模经济建设的进展，国家迫切地需要大量建设干部和技术人才，尤其需要具有高度政治觉悟和一定文化科学知识的工农干部，作为建设的领导骨干。几年来全国各地培养干部的工作都取得了显著的成绩，创造了不少经验，但也有不少缺点和问题。我们虽有大量的经过实际斗争锻炼的工农干部，但他们的文化程度一般较低，因而不易进一步学习政治理论和科学技术。这就严重地影响了干部的提高和培养，使得干部力量与国家建设需要不相适应。根据去年九月份的统计，在全国干部中（军队干部在外），就有一半以上不到初中文化水平，其中有少数人还是文盲。大量工农干部由于缺乏文化不易提高政治水平和业务能力，在新的任务面前，深感不能胜任。这种状况如果不加以改变，势必给国家建设事业造成严重的损失。因此，如何有计划地提高工农干部的文化水平，以培养各项建设事业的骨干，已成为当前党和政府的一项迫切和重大的任务。
    针对这种情况，中共中央发布了“关于加强干部文化教育工作的指示”。各级党委、政府工矿企业和群众团体的领导机关，必须认真研究和讨论这个指示，并切实制订计划，贯彻执行。
    为了有效地开展这一工作，各地党政机关、群众团体和工矿企业的领导同志，首先必须充分认识干部文化教育工作对我国社会主义建设事业的重大意义。中央指示指出：“大量培养与提拔工农干部，和有计划地提高他们的政治、文化、业务水平，使他们成为各项建设事业中的骨干，乃是贯彻党在过渡时期总路线的一项重大的政治任务和组织任务。”但目前仍有不少领导同志，对于这个重大任务没有予以足够的重视。有的认为干部文化教育工作，只是人事、教育部门的事，党委和行政负责人可以不管；或者只作空洞的号召，不作具体的指导，不去切实解决急待解决的问题。有的既不愿意抽调本机关本厂矿的干部去学习，又不注意在工作岗位上组织干部学习，单纯使用干部，而不注意培养干部。他们对于各种干部文化学校的招生工作，采取了敷衍应付的态度，不肯认真抽调质量较好和应该加以培养的干部去入学。有的面对着干部缺乏的困难，不积极地采取有效的措施，有计划地进行培养和提拔，一味等待上级派遣和外地支援。有的甚至认为工农干部不起作用，看不到工农干部的政治品质、发展前途以及他们在工作中的积极作用。在组织学习时，有的对警卫员、通讯员等照顾不够。许多警卫员和通讯员参加革命多年，忠心耿耿，积极要求学习、要求进步，一经学习提高，便会成为明天的优秀干部。事实上已经有了不少这样的例子。因此对这些同志的学习，采取漠不关心的态度，是完全错误的。也有的不分轻重缓急，只吸收勤务人员和保姆入学，而不切实解决干部学习的困难，认真组织干部学习，使得大量的迫切要求学习和必须学习的工农干部，得不到学习文化的机会。这同样是错误的。
    产生上述偏差的基本原因，首先在于有些同志缺乏阶级观点，不懂得建设社会主义必须有工人阶级自己的领导骨干，而有计划地提高工农干部和产业工人的文化水平，乃是培养工人阶级自己的领导骨干的重要步骤。列宁在一九二二年曾经指出：“我们现今所缺少的主要东西，就是文化程度、管理的技术……新经济政策在经济方面和政治方面，都充分保证我们有可能建成社会主义经济基础。问题 ‘仅仅’在于无产阶级及其先锋队底文化力量。”斯大林也在一九三一年论述保证苏联工业发展的六个新条件时，指出其中之一就是“工人阶级应当造就它自己的技术知识界”。他指出，由于苏维埃政权创造了新的工业基地，必须“使我们有更多三倍五倍的工程技术人材和工业指挥人材”，而这些人材不是别的，而是“能了解我国工人阶级底政策，能领会这个政策，并决意诚恳把它实现起来的那种人材”。这就是说，工人阶级应当造就它自己的技术知识界。我国同样需要造就大批工农出身的生产管理干部和生产技术干部，作为团结广大技术人员，建设社会主义的骨干。但现在大量的工农干部还缺乏文化，因此就必须有计划地提高他们的文化水平。毛主席早在一九四二年整风时就说过：“我们党中央现在着重要求工农干部学习文化，因为学了文化以后，政治、军事、经济那一门都可学。”因此我们必须十分重视干部文化教育工作。
    产生上述偏差的另一个原因，在于有些同志缺乏整体观念和长远打算，他们只看到眼前的局部利益，看不到远大的全盘利益，对于今后建设的远景和今后建设人才的需要，常常不能很好加以考虑；在遇到干部力量和建设任务不相适应的问题时，只是头痛医头，脚痛医脚，而不从根本上去有计划地解决这个问题。我们希望各级党委、政府、群众团体和工、矿企业的领导同志，根据中央的指示，彻底批判和纠正各种不正确的思想，以便有效地推进工农干部的文化教育工作。
    其次，对干部文化教育的目的和教学方针，必须有明确一致的认识。过去由于在这个问题上的意见不一致，曾经造成学制、课程以及教材等方面的混乱现象。如有的强调以升学为主，要求把工农干部培养成文化上全面发展的人才，因而在学制课程上，有的地方竟规定为十二年，要求学完普通中学所有的课程；在教学上主张“平衡发展”、“齐头并进”，向普通学校看齐，一切要求正规化，反对速成。有的单纯强调实用，只学和工作或技术关系最密切的一两门课，要求一两年就毕业，急于求成，不注意基础文化的学习，忽视各种知识的相互联系和科学的系统性。有的没有明确的目标，在教学上不定进度，不问效果，学到那里算那里。此次中央的指示，对这一问题作了正确的解决。指示说：“目前开展干部文化教育的目的，在于使文化水平较低的干部，逐步提高到相当于高小以至初中毕业的水平，以便有效地学习政治理论，钻研业务，完成各项工作任务；同时使一部分工农干部能够具备条件升学深造。”对于教学问题，中央指示也明确指出：“必须采取速成的和联系实际的教学方针”。工农干部的文化教育必须适当联系实际工作，以适应工农干部的特点。一般说，工农干部的生活和斗争的经验比较丰富，政治觉悟程度较高，理解力较强，学习要求迫切，所以他们学习文化是能够速成的；但他们工作较忙，流动性较大，时间少而又分散，因此他们的学习不可能也不应该要求完全像普通学校那样正规。课程必须精简集中，不能样样都设。学习年限，不宜拉得过长，也不能过于短暂，以免速而不成。既不能脱离实际地片面强调正规化，又须适当地规定一定进度和制度，以免自流。在教学组织形式方面，也应根据实际需要和可能条件办事。除了一般干部应以业余学习为主而外，为了适应各种建设的迫切需要，各级党、政、企业领导机关，应根据当地具体情况，有计划有重点地将有条件的产业工人和农村区委书记和区长以上的工农干部，在不妨碍生产和工作的原则下，分期分批地抽调离职，组织他们集中学习，使他们能在较短时间内掌握基本的文化知识，从而进一步学习政治和业务，逐步成为建设事业的骨干。
    第三，能否做好干部文化教育工作，关键在于领导。过去除了思想上、方针上的问题以外，在组织领导上也存在着问题，必须切实加以解决。其中最主要的是领导不统一和缺乏专管机构的问题。各地有的由党委管，有的由文委管，有的由教育厅（局、科）管，有的由人事局（处、科）管，有的由扫除文盲委员会管，有的由工会管，还有的同时由几个机关管，其中管得好的固然也有，但大多数尚未认真地管，或者大家都管而实际上大家都不管。因此，工作既无计划又无检查，经验没有总结，缺点和偏差不能及时克服，遇到困难问题时，往往互相推诿，长期不能解决，使得工作陷于自流。这种情况必须很快加以改变。对干部文化教育工作，必须实行统一领导，设置专管机构来认真管好它。这主要依靠各级党委切实负责领导起来，组织各方面的力量，贯彻中央的方针，定出确实可行的计划，认真督促检查，克服缺点，总结经验，解决亟待解决的问题。所谓统一领导，并不是事无大小，都由党委包办，而是统一方针，统一计划，在统一的方针和计划下，各部门和各地方分工分级管理。各地应该掌握“统一领导，分别管理”的原则，发挥各部门各地方的积极性和创造性。必须设置干部文化教育的专管机构，或指定某一机关和专人，专门负起责任来。此项专管机构应根据中央指示，结合当地具体情况，由各地因地制宜，逐步地建立起来，务使事有专责，不再发生无人管的现象。在当前急待解决的具体问题中，主要是编制和经费问题，关于这点，此次中央指示中已有明确规定，各级党委、政府、特别是工矿企业领导机关，务须根据这一指示，结合本地本单位的具体情况，协同有关部门，认真加以解决。
