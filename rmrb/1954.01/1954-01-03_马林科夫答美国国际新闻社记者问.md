Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 1st: The newspapers on January 1st carried the replies of G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, to questions posed by Mr. Kingsbury Smith, Head of the European Bureau of the American International News Service.

On December 28, 1953, Mr. Kingsbury Smith took the opportunity of the New Year to ask G.M. Malenkov to answer several questions.

The following are Mr. Kingsbury Smith’s questions and G.M. Malenkov’s replies.

Question 1: What is your New Year greeting for the American people for 1954?

Answer: I wholeheartedly wish the American people happiness and a peaceful life. I wish the American people success in developing friendly relations with all peoples, and complete success in the noble cause of defending peace from sabotage.

Question 2: Do you hope that the friendly relations between the American and Soviet people will be strengthened in the new year?

Answer: First, it is necessary to hope that relations between our two countries will improve. I believe there are no objective factors preventing the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States in the New Year, or preventing the strengthening of the traditional friendly relations between our two peoples. I hope that the actual situation will be so.

Question 3: In your opinion, what are the prospects for safeguarding world peace and easing international tensions in 1954?

Answer: All peoples long for lasting peace, and there are favorable conditions for further easing international tensions in 1954. Governments of all countries, especially the governments of the major powers, cannot but heed the voices of the people, and cannot but consider their growing desire for lasting peace.

As for the Soviet government, it has always done and will always do everything in its power to ensure that all peoples live together in peace, to promote the easing of international tensions, and to establish normal international relations.

Question 4: In your opinion, what steps should be taken in 1954 that would be the most beneficial to world peace?

Answer: Such a step would be for all countries to conclude an agreement in which each signatory undertakes a sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, or other weapons of mass destruction. Such an agreement would make it easier to reach an agreement on the complete prohibition of atomic weapons, and on establishing strict international supervision to ensure that atomic energy is not used for war purposes.

At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it is also necessary to reach an agreement on a substantial reduction of all other types of armaments and armed forces.

All of this would undoubtedly reduce military expenditures in all countries and improve the economic situation of the people.

    马林科夫答美国国际新闻社记者问
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日电：一月一日，各报刊载了苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫对美国国际新闻社欧洲分社社长金斯伯里·史密斯先生所提问题的答复。
    一九五三年十二月二十八日，金·史密斯先生趁新年的机会要求格·马·马林科夫答复几个问题。
    以下就是金·史密斯先生的问题和格·马·马林科夫的答复。
    问题一：您给美国人民的一九五四年祝词是什么？
    答：我衷心祝美国人民幸福，祝他们得过和平生活。我祝美国人民在发展和各国人民的友好关系方面获得成功，在保卫和平免遭阴谋破坏的崇高事业中获得圆满成就。
    问题二：您希望在新的一年内美苏两国人民友好关系获得加强吗？
    答：首先有必要希望我们两国之间的关系得到改善。我认为，没有客观的因素阻碍苏联和美国之间的关系在新的一年内得到改善，阻碍我们两国人民之间传统的友好关系得到加强。我希望实际情况将是这样。
    问题三：据您看来，在一九五四年内，保卫世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势的可能性如何？
    答：各国人民都渴望持久和平，在一九五四年内国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，是存在着有利的条件的。各国政府，首先是各大国的政府，不能不倾听人民的呼声，不能不考虑他们对持久和平的日益增长的愿望。
    至于苏联政府，它过去、现在和将来都竭尽一切力量，以使各国人民和平相处，促使国际紧张局势缓和，并建立正常的国际关系。
    问题四：您以为，在一九五四年内应该采取怎样的步骤才是有利于世界和平的最重要的步骤？
    答：这样的步骤是，各国缔结一个协定，各缔约国在这一协定中承担神圣和无条件的义务，不使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器。这样一个协定，将会使关于完全禁止原子武器、关于为保证禁止把原子能用于战争目的而建立严格的国际监督的问题，易于达成协议。
    和这同时，苏联政府认为，就大量裁减其他一切类型的军备和武装部队的问题达成协议，也是必要的。
    这一切无疑地将会减少各国的军费开支，使人民的经济境况有所改善。
