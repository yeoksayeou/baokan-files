(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 19) Stanislaw Gajewski, Polish member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, issued the following statement to Xinhua News Agency and the Korean Central News Agency on January 14:

    At today's meeting of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, Lieutenant General K.S. Thimayya, Chairman of the Commission and representative of India, presented two letters to the Commission. Subsequently, in his personal capacity as Chairman of the Commission, he sent these two letters to the so-called United Nations Command and the Command of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In these two letters, the Chairman of the Commission explained the Commission's work to date, as well as the new situation arising from the suspension of explanatory work and the failure to convene a political conference. He then suggested that the commands of both sides agree to return the prisoners of war under the care of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission who have not yet exercised their right to repatriation to their original detaining sides, respectively. According to the Chairman of the Commission's suggestion, these prisoners of war would still be transferred as prisoners of war.
    At today's meeting, the Polish delegation expressed its clear opposition to the Chairman of the Commission's suggestion. The Polish delegation believes that if the prisoners of war are returned to their original detaining parties according to the suggestion of the head of the Indian delegation, it would be a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." According to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," prisoners of war transferred to the Commission's care shall not be returned to the original detaining party under any circumstances. The solution suggested by the Chairman of the Commission would, in fact, be a step backward in resolving the issue of repatriating prisoners of war and would only serve to exacerbate the tensions in Korea. I would like to point out that the aforementioned letters from the Chairman of the Commission, apart from their conclusion, contain some correct statements in principle to which the Polish delegation fully agrees. In his letter, the Chairman of the Commission, in addition to addressing other issues, clearly stated that the Commission has the full right to interpret the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," and that in order to finally release the prisoners of war from their status as prisoners of war and make them civilians, it is first necessary to make up for the period of explanatory work, and to submit the issue of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation after explanation to the political conference stipulated in Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement for resolution. The Chairman of the Commission further stated that in view of the insufficient period of explanatory work and the fact that the political conference has not been able to convene so far, it is impermissible to change the status of the prisoners of war under the care of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. He also stated that "any unilateral action by any party concerned would not be in accordance with the 'Terms of Reference'." However, contrary to these arguments, the Chairman of the Commission reached the completely erroneous conclusion in two letters to return the prisoners of war to both sides before January 23 this year. The only correct conclusion in accordance with the letter and spirit of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" is to recognize that the Commission has the responsibility to extend the explanation, make up for the ninety-day period, and submit the issue of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation after the explanation to the political conference to be held for resolution within thirty days. Obviously, as long as the Commission makes such a decision, the period of custody of prisoners of war by the Indian Custodial Forces should be extended accordingly. Only such a solution is in line with the purpose of the Armistice Agreement and the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." The Polish delegation has repeatedly and resolutely demanded that the Commission make such a decision.
    Based on these circumstances, as I mentioned at the beginning, the Polish delegation firmly opposed the solution proposed by the Indian delegation at the Commission meeting and reserves the right to issue a detailed statement on this issue at a later stage after thoroughly studying the two documents presented today.

(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 19) Ladislav Simovic, Czechoslovak member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, issued the following statement to Xinhua News Agency and the Korean Central News Agency on January 14:

    On January 14, 1954, Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, sent letters to the United Nations Command and the Command of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, suggesting that the prisoners of war under the care of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission who have not exercised their right to repatriation be returned to the custody of their original detaining parties before January 23, 1954.
    In view of this step taken by the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Czechoslovak delegation deems it necessary to issue the following statement:
    (1) The recommendation in the letter from the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not only does not conform to the attitude of the Czechoslovak delegation, but also directly contradicts it. In addition, this suggestion is also not in line with the position of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This suggestion only represents the Chairman of the Commission's own views, and he clearly stated at the Commission meeting on January 14, 1954, that this action was only on behalf of himself and that he was responsible for it himself.
    (2) The attitude of the Czechoslovak delegation has always been that only the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has the right to interpret the clauses of the "Terms of Reference," and it also has the right to make various decisions in order to correctly implement the "Terms of Reference." The Czechoslovak delegation believes that, therefore, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also has the right to decide to continue the interrupted explanation and make up for the ninety-day explanation period stipulated in the "Terms of Reference." The majority of the Committee has indicated that the explanation should be continued and that extending the explanation period is legal and necessary.
    (3) Returning the prisoners of war to the custody of their original detaining parties would violate the "Terms of Reference" and the basis of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Such a measure would permanently deprive the prisoners of war of the right to exercise their right to repatriation, which is guaranteed to them by the Armistice Agreement and is the most fundamental goal and basic purpose of the "Terms of Reference." The method of disposing of prisoners of war implied by this measure is not only not stipulated by the "Terms of Reference," but is also most explicitly disallowed by the "Terms of Reference." The Chairman himself admitted in the letter that any change in the status of prisoners of war, or any other method of disposing of prisoners of war without implementing the explanation procedure and without discussion at the political conference, is impermissible. Therefore, "any unilateral action by any party concerned would not be in accordance with the 'Terms of Reference'," and the measures suggested in the letter from the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are precisely such unilateral actions.
    (4) The Czechoslovak delegation believes that any measure aimed at returning prisoners of war to the custody of their original detaining parties is inhumane, unjust, and illegal, and that such a measure would greatly violate the "Terms of Reference" and even threaten the Korean armistice. Therefore, the Czechoslovak delegation has opposed and will continue to oppose any such measures.

    中立国遣返委员会波、捷委员发表声明
    反对把战俘交还给原拘留各方
    【新华社开城十九日电】中立国遣返委员会波兰委员、特命全权公使斯坦尼斯瓦夫·加耶夫斯基于一月十四日对新华社与朝鲜中央通讯社发表声明如下：
    在中立国遣返委员会今天的会议上，委员会主席印度代表克·斯·蒂迈雅中将向委员会提出了两封信，随后，他以委员会主席个人的名义将这两封信送交所谓联合国军司令部以及朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军司令部。在这两封信里，委员会主席说明了委员会迄今为止的工作情况，以及由于解释工作的停顿与政治会议的未能召开而引起的新的形势，然后建议双方司令部同意把在中立国遣返委员会看管下迄今还没有行使他们的遣返权利的战俘分别交还给原拘留方面。按照委员会主席的建议，这些战俘将仍然作为战俘被移交过去。
    在今天的会议上，波兰代表团对委员会主席的建议表示了明确的反对态度。波兰代表团认为：如果按照印度代表团团长的建议，将战俘交还给原拘留方面，那是悍然破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的基本原则的，按照“职权范围”的规定，移交给委员会看管的战俘在任何情况下都不得交还给原拘留方。委员会主席所建议的解决办法，事实上将是在解决遣返战俘问题方面倒退了一步，因此只能促使朝鲜紧张局势更加恶化。我愿意指出，上述委员会主席的信件，除了它的结论以外，原则上包含有一些为波兰代表团所完全同意的正确的说法。委员会主席在他的信中除了谈到其他一些问题以外，还明白地说，委员会有充分权利解释“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的条文，并且说为了最后解除战俘的战俘身份使之成为平民，必须首先补足解释工作的期限，并将经过解释后未行使其遣返权利的战俘问题交由停战协定第六十款规定举行的政治会议去解决。委员会主席进一步说，鉴于解释工作期限的不足，鉴于迄今为止政治会议没有能够召开，想改变中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘的身份是不能容许的，他又说，“任何有关方面的任何片面行动将不符合于该‘职权范围’。”但是，与这些论点相反，委员会主席在两封信中得出了在今年一月二十三日以前把战俘交还双方的完全错误的结论。符合于“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”条文的字句和精神的唯一正确的结论是：承认委员会有责任延长解释、补足九十天期限，把解释结束后尚未行使遣返权利的战俘问题提交将要举行的政治会议于三十天内予以解决。显然，只要委员会作出了这样的决定，印度看管部队对战俘的看管期限即应相应延长。只有这样的解决才符合于停战协定和“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的目的，波兰代表团曾一再坚决要求委员会作出这样的决定。
    根据这些情况，如我在开头已经提到的，波兰代表团在委员会会议上坚决反对印度代表团提出的解决办法，并保留权利以便在以后阶段、在彻底研究了今天提出的两个文件后就这个问题发表详细的声明。
    【新华社开城十九日电】中立国遣返委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员、特命全权大使拉吉斯拉夫·西莫维茨在十四日对新华社和朝鲜中央通讯社发表了如下声明：
    一九五四年一月十四日，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将致函联合国军司令部以及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部，建议在一九五四年一月二十三日以前把中立国遣返委员会看管的未曾行使遣返权利的战俘交还给原拘留各方看管。
    鉴于中立国遣返委员会主席采取的这一步骤，捷克斯洛伐克代表团认为有必要发表如下声明：
      （一）中立国遣返委员会主席信中的建议不仅不符合于捷克斯洛伐克代表团的态度，而且和它直接抵触。此外，这个建议也不符合于中立国遣返委员会的立场。这个建议只代表委员会主席自己的观点，他在一九五四年一月十四日的委员会会议上曾经明白声明，他采取的这个行动只是代表他自己，并且由他自己负责。
    （二）捷克斯洛伐克代表团的态度一向是：只有中立国遣返委员会有权对“职权范围”的条款作出解释，它也有权为了正确地实施“职权范围”而作出种种决定。捷克斯洛伐克代表团认为，因此，中立国遣返委员会也有权决定继续中断了的解释，补足“职权范围”中规定的九十天解释期限。委员会的大多数已经表示，解释应予继续，延长解释期限是合法的和必要的。
      （三）把战俘交还原拘留方面看管就会违反“职权范围”和朝鲜停战协定的基础。这样的措施会永远剥夺战俘行使遣返权利的权利，而这种权利是停战协定向他们保证的，并且是“职权范围”的最根本的目标和基本目的。这种措施所意味着的处置战俘的办法，不仅不是“职权范围”所规定的，而且是“职权范围”最明确地不容许的。主席自己在信中承认，对战俘身份的任何变更、或未经实行解释程序和未经政治会议讨论的任何其他的处置战俘办法都是不可容许的，因此，“任何有关方面的任何片面行动将不符合于该‘职权范围’”，而中立国遣返委员会主席信中建议的措施正好是这种片面行动。
      （四）捷克斯洛伐克代表团认为，旨在把战俘交还给原拘留方面看管的任何措施都是不人道的、不公正的、非法的，这种措施会大大违反“职权范围”甚至威胁到朝鲜停战。所以，捷克斯洛伐克代表团在现在和将来都竭力反对任何这一类的措施。
