Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 22nd (TASS dispatch)
The great creator of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, the brilliant revolutionary theorist, thinker, and organizer, the leader and teacher of working people in all countries, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, passed away thirty years ago. U.I. Lenin unreservedly dedicated his entire life to the people. He devoted all his great strength, brilliant talent, and indomitable will to the cause of liberating the working people from capitalist enslavement. The immortal cause of Lenin lives on and will be forever glorified! The great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism – the tremendous source of all our victories – will last for all time!

The Communist Party created and educated by Lenin has traversed a long and glorious path. Faithful to Lenin's teachings, the Party has guided our people to the victory of socialism. Relying on the wholehearted support of all the people of the Soviet Union, the Party is resolutely and confidently fulfilling the grand task of building communism.

The great Leninist ideas illuminate the path of struggle for the working people of all countries and exert a tremendous influence on the entire course of world history. Lenin's immortal image lives forever in the hearts and minds of millions, inspiring them to fight against capitalist oppression, for a free life, and for peace and friendship among peoples. Leninism has become the invincible doctrine for building a new world. The greatness of Lenin's revolutionary scientific foresight and the laws of modern social development discovered by Lenin are becoming clearer and more convincing.

Lenin made a brilliant and scientific analysis of the economic and political essence of imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism. After Lenin discovered the law of uneven development of capitalism in the age of imperialism, he concluded that socialism could first triumph in several countries, or even in one country. In this way, Lenin armed the Communist Party he founded ideologically, pointed out a clear goal for the Party, and unfolded a great and historically significant prospect. The Party bravely and confidently led the Russian working class and its revolutionary ally, the peasantry, into the struggle against autocracy and capitalism, and achieved the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era in world history – the era of the triumph of socialism.

Lenin guided the Soviet state towards the broad and bright road of establishing a socialist society and armed the Party with clear methods of building socialism. The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union is an important and great summary of the Party's organizational and guiding activities and the heroic creative labor of all our people, and it is the result of the Party's unwavering loyalty to Lenin's legacy and the realization of these wise precepts.

Lenin's immortal genius opened the path for a gradual transition from socialism to communism. In his immortal works, he put forward fundamental instructions on the conditions for building a communist society. Lenin pointed out that these conditions are to do everything possible to develop the productive forces of socialist society, constantly improve socialist production relations, continuously increase labor productivity, and create abundant consumer goods.

Based on these instructions, the Party has formulated a grand plan for communist construction and is consistently implementing this plan. The task set by the Party to rapidly increase agricultural and consumer goods production is being victoriously realized. Now, when our powerful heavy industry has been established and is continuing to develop, there are all objective possibilities for this increase. The task put forward by the Party is to fully utilize these possibilities to ensure that the material welfare and cultural level of the people continue to improve, and to fully meet the people's growing demand for food and daily necessities in the next two or three years. Completing these tasks is a major step forward for Soviet society on the road from the gradual transition from socialism to communism.

In guiding the creative energy of the Soviet people to solve the practical tasks of communist construction, the Party follows Lenin's legacy, carefully protects and unswervingly strengthens the alliance between the working class and the peasantry. The completion of the historic tasks set by the September Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee will further strengthen this unbreakable alliance – the foundation of the strength of our motherland.

Our multi-ethnic Soviet state has developed and strengthened on the basis of the policy of friendship among all nationalities formulated by the great Lenin. The cause of strengthening the friendship among all nationalities is constantly cared for by our Party Central Committee, and our Party adheres unswervingly to the Leninist-Stalinist national policy.

The Party and the government are realizing the great tasks of communist construction and resolutely pursuing a policy of peace and friendship among all nations. The basis of this policy has always been U.I. Lenin's instruction on the possibility of long-term peaceful coexistence between our country and capitalist countries. Lenin proclaimed a policy of peace among all nations and took it as the foundation of the Soviet state's foreign policy orientation. Lenin's instruction on the possibility of coexistence and peaceful economic cooperation between two different systems, namely the socialist system and the capitalist system, is the basic principle of the Soviet government's efforts to consolidate a lasting peace and ease international tensions. The Soviet government's efforts to resolve all outstanding international issues peacefully have received enthusiastic and growing support and sympathy from all progressive humanity.

The great Chinese people, the people of the people's democratic countries – the entire camp of peace, democracy and socialism, as well as millions upon millions of honest ordinary people in capitalist countries, are fighting alongside us for peace. Lenin is the banner of peace and friendship among the peoples of the world. This great banner inspires all progressive humanity to strive for peace and for a bright future for the people of the world. Leninism mobilizes the working people of all countries to fight stubbornly against the forces of aggression and imperialism, and to strive for a lasting and just peace for all peoples, large and small, and for all the people of the world.

The Communist Party, founded and nurtured by Lenin and tempered by Lenin in arduous struggles with countless enemies, has won the boundless trust and great love of the masses of the people and all working people with its half-century of activity and its loyal service to the interests of the people. Lenin called the Communist Party the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our era. Our heroic Communist Party has guided the Soviet people to the victory of socialism and is now victoriously leading the construction of communism. It stands at the forefront of the world revolutionary and liberation movement.

The strength of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union lies in its rock-solid unity, in the ideological and organizational consistency of its ranks, in its unwavering loyalty to Leninism, and in its inseparable connection with the working masses and the people.

The most important organizational principle of our Party is Lenin's principle of collective leadership. Relying on the scientific principles of Marxist-Leninist theory, on the broad initiative of leading cadres, and on the creativity and activism of the masses, the Central Committee ensures correct leadership of the Party and the state with collective experience and collective wisdom.

The entire Party unanimously supports the resolutions of the July and September plenary sessions of the Central Committee, thus showing time and again that all Party organizations are faithful to the great banner of Lenin, and that they are united around the Party Central Committee – the authoritative and wise leadership composed of Lenin and Stalin's students and comrades-in-arms.

Under the banner of invincible Leninism, the Party and its Central Committee are confidently guiding the country along the bright road of communism from victory to victory, along the path indicated by the immortal Lenin.

    沿着伟大的列宁所指出的道路前进
    ——苏联“真理报”一月二十二日社论
    共产党和苏维埃国家的伟大的缔造者、天才的革命理论家、思想家和组织者、世界各国劳动人民的领袖和导师乌拉季米尔·伊里奇·列宁逝世三十年了。乌·伊·列宁无保留地把自己的全部生命贡献给了人民。他把自己的全部的巨大力量、光辉的天才和不屈不挠的意志献给了把劳动人民从资本主义奴役下解放出来的事业。不朽的列宁的事业永存，永远发扬光大。伟大的马克思列宁主义的学说——我们一切胜利的巨大源泉将万世长存！
    列宁所缔造的和教养出来的共产党已经走过了漫长而光荣的道路。党忠实于列宁的学说，引导我国人民取得了社会主义的胜利。党依靠苏联全体人民的全心全意的支持，坚决地、满怀信心地完成着建设共产主义的宏伟的任务。
    伟大的列宁主义思想照耀着世界各国劳动人民的斗争道路，对世界历史的整个进程发生着巨大的影响。列宁的不朽的形象永远活在千百万人的心中和意识里，鼓舞他们去为反对资本主义压迫、争取自由的生活、争取和平与各国人民之间的友谊而斗争。列宁主义已经成为建设新世界的战无不胜的学说。列宁的革命的科学预见的伟大、列宁所发现的现代社会发展的法则，愈来愈清楚地、愈来愈令人信服地得到了证明。
    列宁对作为资本主义最高阶段的帝国主义的经济本质和政治本质作了精辟的、科学的分析。列宁发现了资本主义在帝国主义阶段发展不平衡的规律之后，得出结论说：社会主义能够在几个国家、甚至在一个国家内首先取得胜利。这样，列宁就在思想上武装了他所建立起来的共产党，给党指出了明确的目标，展开了伟大的具有历史意义的前景。党勇敢地和满怀信心地领导俄国工人阶级及其革命同盟军——农民投入了反专制、反资本主义的斗争，取得了伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，这一胜利打开了世界历史的新纪元——社会主义胜利的纪元。
    列宁把苏维埃国家引导向建立社会主义社会的广阔的和光明的大道，并以建设社会主义的明确方法武装了党。社会主义在苏联的胜利，是党的组织和指导活动以及我国全体人民的英雄的创造性劳动的重要的和伟大的总结，是党毫不动摇地忠于列宁遗训的结果，是实现这些英明的遗训的结果。
    列宁的永远不灭的天才打开由社会主义逐渐向共产主义过渡的道路。他在他的不朽著作中对建设共产主义社会的条件提出了原则性的基本指示。列宁指出，这些条件就是尽力发展社会主义社会的生产力，不断地改善社会主义的生产关系，不断提高劳动生产率，创造丰富的消费品。
    党根据这些指示，制订了宏伟的共产主义建设计划，并始终不渝地执行这个计划。党所制订的急速提高农业和消费品生产的任务，正在胜利地实现着。现在，当我国强大的重工业已建立起来并在继续发展的时候，这种提高有着一切客观的可能性。党提出的任务是充分利用这种可能性，以保证人民的物质福利和文化水平继续不断地得到提高，在最近两三年内充分地满足人民对食品和日用品的不断增长的需求。完成这些任务，就是苏维埃社会在从社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的道路上迈进了一大步。
    在引导苏联人民的创造性的精力去解决共产主义建设的实际任务时，党遵照着列宁的遗训，谨慎地保护着并坚定不移地加强着工人阶级和农民的联盟。完成党中央委员会九月全体会议所制订的历史性的任务，将进一步加强这个牢不可破的联盟——我们祖国的力量的基础。
    我们多民族的苏维埃国家在伟大的列宁所制订的各族人民友好的政策的基础上发展了，并且加强了。加强各族人民的友谊的事业经常受到我们党中央委员会的关怀，我们的党坚持不渝地奉行列宁—斯大林民族政策。
    党和政府实现着共产主义建设的伟大任务，并坚决执行着各国人民之间和平友好的政策。这种政策的根据始终是乌·伊·列宁关于我们国家和资本主义国家可能长期和平共处的指示。列宁宣布了各国人民之间和平的政策，并把它作为苏维埃国家外交政策方针的基础，列宁关于两个不同制度，即社会主义制度和资本主义制度有可能共处与进行和平的经济合作的指示，是苏联政府为争取巩固和持久的和平、为缓和国际紧张局势而努力的基本原则。苏联政府竭尽一切努力以和平解决所有悬而未决的国际问题，这得到了全体进步人类热烈的、日益增长的支持和同情。
    伟大的中国人民、各人民民主国家的人民——整个和平、民主和社会主义阵营，以及资本主义国家中千千万万正直的普通人，和我们一道为和平而斗争。列宁是和平和世界各国人民友好的旗帜。这面伟大的旗帜鼓舞着整个进步人类去争取和平、争取世界人民光明的未来。列宁主义的思想动员各国劳动人民顽强地和侵略势力及帝国主义势力进行斗争，动员他们为各大、小民族及全世界所有人民而争取持久和公正的和平。
    由列宁所缔造和培养、并在和无数敌人进行艰苦斗争中由列宁锻炼出来的共产党，以其半世纪来的全部活动和它对人民利益的忠诚服务，获得了人民群众和全体劳动人民无限的信任和很大的爱戴。列宁把共产党称为我们这个时代的智慧、荣誉和良心。我们英雄的共产党引导苏联人民取得了社会主义的胜利，现在正在胜利地领导着共产主义的建设。它走在世界革命和解放运动的最前列。
    苏联共产党的力量在于它磐石一般的团结，在于它的队伍在思想上和组织上的一致，在于它对列宁主义不可动摇的忠诚，在于它和劳动群众和人民所保持的不可分割的联系。
    我们党最重要的组织原则是列宁的集体领导的原则。中央委员会依靠马克思列宁主义理论的科学原则，依靠领导干部的广泛的主动性，依靠人民群众的创造力和积极性，以集体经验和集体智慧保证对党和国家的正确的领导。
    全党一致拥护中央委员会七月和九月全体会议的决议，从而一次又一次地显示出所有党组织是忠实于伟大的列宁的旗帜的，显示出它们是团结在党中央委员会——由列宁和斯大林的学生和战友们组成的、权威的、英明的领导机构——的周围。
    在战无不胜的列宁主义的旗帜下，党及其中央委员会沿着不朽的列宁所指示的道路，满怀信心地引导着国家沿着共产主义的光辉大道，从胜利走向胜利。
