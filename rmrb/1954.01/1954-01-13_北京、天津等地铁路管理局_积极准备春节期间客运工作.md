   【本报讯】北京、天津、上海、广州、西安等地铁路管理局职工，正在积极准备春节旅客运输工作，保证春节期间旅客能安全、便利地乘坐火车回家欢度节日。
    北京铁路管理局成立了春节旅客安全运输委员会，北京运输分局、北京站和列车段也都组织了同样的分、支机构，负责指挥、组织旅客乘车。北京运输分局取得了北京市总工会等机关、团体的协助，正进行首都旅客流动情况调查工作。据估计，今年春节首都旅客将比去年同期增加百分之十四左右。天津、上海、广州、西安、济南、吉林等地铁路管理局，也正在主动地取得当地党委和机关、团体的协助，进行旅客流动情况调查工作。各地将根据调查结果和其他资料编制输送计划，加开临时客车或加挂车辆。
    为了便利旅客购买车票，北京、天津等站都将设立出售团体票的窗口，并且在市内增设售票处所。北京站在最近召开的干部会上，着重讨论了安全运输和对旅客进行安全乘车的宣传问题。西安站组织了一个安全小组，专门负责解决旅客安全乘车问题。
