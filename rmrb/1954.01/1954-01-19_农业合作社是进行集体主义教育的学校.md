Agricultural Cooperatives are Schools for Conducting Collectivist Education

For the Sake of Increased Production for the Whole Cooperative

	In Sichuan Province, many members of agricultural production cooperatives are gradually cultivating collectivist thought through collective labor. When the Li Kunxian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bazhong County was established last spring, the members retained a considerable amount of land for private cultivation. After eight months of collective labor, the members added their private plots to the cooperative. The area of private plots decreased from 24% to 7% of the total land of the cooperative. When the Pu Gugui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Suining County planted cotton last year, the members changed their past habit of only caring about their own production. The four production teams frequently checked and helped each other, resulting in increased cotton production for the entire cooperative. Guided by the idea that "the cooperative relies on everyone, and everyone relies on the cooperative," Feng Yinzhou, a member of the Yue Yuanqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luxian County, would check all the dry fields in the cooperative for water retention every time it rained. If he found leaks or gaps in the field ridges, he would immediately repair them. Sometimes, even in the middle of the night, he braved the rain to repair ridges that had been washed away by the water. When Zhang Guifang, a female member of the Wang Daan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Santai County, went to the streets to collect manure, she would quickly pick up any dog feces she saw by the roadside and put it in the manure bucket. When the women in the cooperative picked cotton, no one wanted to drop a single boll. These actions moved the farmers outside the cooperative to say, "Even siblings born of the same mother have different minds, but the cooperative works with one heart."

Privately Retained Land Greatly Reduced

	The land of the Xiang Minghai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yan Shang Village, Longbao Township, Wanxian County, Sichuan Province, consists of sandy soil and yellow mud, with poor soil quality and a lack of water sources. However, because the members collectively improved production techniques, accumulated a large amount of fertilizer, and planted crops according to local conditions, production increased by more than 40% in 1953 compared to 1952. All the members of the cooperative lived a middle-peasant life, becoming a model for local farmers to organize and engage in collective production.

	The fact that agricultural production cooperatives produced more grain educated the members about the fact that they can only become prosperous together by organizing and relying on everyone's efforts. In the past, everyone only contributed land as shares but not the land-use rights. Now, each member, except for retaining two sheng of vegetable garden land, has contributed all their land as shares. The private land of all the members decreased from 10% to 3% of the total land of the cooperative. The members no longer only care about their individual land, but care about the entire cooperative's land. Member Zhang Cailian did not work hard in the cooperative in the past. After a meeting, everyone ideologically enlightened and helped him correct his shortcomings. His awareness improved, and he actively participated in various activities within the cooperative. The members also treated each other with mutual concern. Member Chen Ziyuan was short of food at one time, and member Xiang Mingchun took the initiative to lend him four sheng of wheat. Member Fan Shizhen was once ill, and the members carried her to the hospital, with the cooperative paying 100,000 yuan for medical expenses, solving her problem of not having money for treatment. Now, Xiang Minghai, Zhang Heyin, and Xiang Shifeng have joined the Communist Party, and Fan Shizhen has joined the Communist Youth League. They said, "We must lead everyone well and move towards collective farms."

Calling the Cooperative "Our Cooperative" Now

	The members of the Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, now universally and affectionately call the production cooperative "Our Cooperative." When the cooperative was first established, some members did not cherish the use of public farm tools, throwing them around carelessly, thinking, "It doesn't matter if they get damaged." Now, most people have a different view, cherishing every bit of the cooperative's property. Old man Zuo Piji, who is over sixty years old, will try to pick up any manure left by the livestock. When member Liu Pengfei joined the cooperative, he was very worried that his land boundary stones would be removed, and that he would not be able to find his boundary when he left the cooperative. Therefore, he buried the original boundary stones underground and planted a mulberry tree on top. After a year of collective labor, he changed his views, realizing that such thinking and practices could not lead to a socialist society. In 1953, when the cooperative planted wheat, he voluntarily dug up the tree and boundary stones. The five mu of sandy land of member Zhang Xiaolai were used to grow peanuts in the past, and he relied entirely on the autumn harvest. Last year, the cooperative planted peanuts on this land again. Unfortunately, there was a lot of rain in the autumn, and all the peanuts were flooded. However, because the distribution was reasonable according to labor and shares, his family's autumn income was still higher than last year. He said with emotion, "If it weren't for the agricultural production cooperative, I would have been in trouble." Member Ma Shunyou was originally afraid of low income and wanted to withdraw from the cooperative and work on his own. Recently, after calculating that the grain income in 1953 was three or four dan more than in 1952, he was so happy that he not only did not mention withdrawing from the cooperative, but also expressed his determination to follow the Communist Party to socialism.

Wholeheartedly Run the Cooperative Well

	The members of the Mo Ruxin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingluo County, Ningxia Province, have been constantly educated in collective labor, and their thinking has undergone great changes. During production last year, Liu Jinzhong, Liu Tianqi, and other four cooperative members voluntarily dug up their field ridges for the convenience of cultivation, combining the small plots of land into a large plot. Li Yaozhen (member of the Communist Youth League) was responsible for feeding the livestock in the cooperative. One night, a mule became ill, so he called a few people to administer medicine. After the others rested, he took the mule outside for a walk and did not sleep all night. He said, "A cow is the lifeblood of a farming household. We must cherish the public mules of the cooperative even more." Li Mingxin, a military dependent, seeing the difficulties the cooperative had in taking care of her, became more active in leading the women members to participate in production. After the income was distributed last year, she roughly calculated that her family could have more than 3,000 jin of grain left over. Some people gave her ideas, advising her to sell the surplus grain. Besides food and clothing, she could buy several more sheep to raise herself. However, Li Mingxin's idea was not like that. She invested one million yuan from selling grain into the cooperative. She said, "I will not buy sheep myself first. In case some new members have difficulties next year, we can adjust for them. I want to help them first, not just think about myself."

Love the Country, Love the Cooperative, Love the Cooperative Members

	The fact that the Yang Yunxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gusi Lang Village, Nanle County, Henan Province, has increased production year after year for the past two years has made the members love the agricultural production cooperative even more. When the crops were about to mature last year, the members competed to go to the fields at night to watch the crops. Yang Chengxuan, the management committee member, went to the fields three times in one night. Zhang Tongshu's mother, who is over fifty years old, also asked to go to the fields to watch the peanuts. Cui Suocheng voluntarily repaired the damaged farm tools in the cooperative. In the past, everyone would run home when it rained. Now, every time it rains, they rush to the cooperative and the threshing ground to tidy up the cooperative's things. The members understand that the collective interests of the cooperative are closely linked to their own interests. The members have further promoted the spirit of friendship, harmony and unity. In the past, no one cared if someone got sick. Now, as soon as they hear that someone is sick, they go to see them, ask about them, and ask doctors and get medicine. Member Liu Wenbao was moved to tears by the friendly spirit of the cooperative members during his illness.

	Collectivist thinking is manifested politically in the improvement of patriotic ideological awareness. In addition to actively paying patriotic public grain, the members also sell the superior varieties selected from their cooperative to the state. The government will promote the improved varieties to improve agricultural production. Before October 1953, they sold 1,680 jin of wheat and 6,420 jin of coarse grains to the state. In addition, when the cooperative joined with the masses to burn bricks, the masses outside the cooperative underreported 200,000 yuan in taxes, and the members immediately proposed to make a supplementary report.

Established a Patriotic and Mutual Aid Atmosphere

	The members of the Le Yuzhu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, have established a patriotic and mutual aid atmosphere in collective labor and under the education of the Party. Last year, during the national grain purchase, they took the lead in selling 10,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. After the rice was harvested, they automatically took out 8,415 jin of successfully tested superior varieties and exchanged them for farmers throughout the county to use. Last year, female member Jiang Qiuhua had sores on her hands and could not wash clothes. Lin Donghua, a woman in the cooperative, voluntarily washed clothes for her family for more than 20 days. Qiuhua said with emotion, "In the past, no one would care if the clothes smelled. This is really the benefit of cooperation!"

    农业合作社是进行集体主义教育的学校
    为了全社增产
    四川省不少农业生产合作社的成员，在集体劳动中逐渐培养起集体主义思想。巴中县李坤先农业生产合作社去年春天成立时，社员们自留耕地相当多，经过八个月的集体劳动以后，社员们又把自耕地加入社内，自耕地已由占全社土地的百分之二十四减少到百分之七。遂宁县蒲固贵农业生产合作社去年种棉花时，社员们便改变了过去只关心自己生产的习惯，四个生产小组经常互相检查、互相帮助，使全社棉花都增产。泸县岳元清农业生产合作社社员冯银洲在“社靠大家，大家靠社”的思想引导下，每逢下雨都要检查社内所有的干田能不能蓄水，发现田埂有漏眼和缺口，就马上补好，有时在深夜，他也冒雨补修被水冲垮的田埂。三台县王达安农业生产合作社女社员张桂芳在上街挑粪时，看见路旁有狗粪也赶快拾在粪桶内。该社妇女们在拾棉花时，谁也不愿掉了一瓣棉花。这些行为感动得社外农民说：一个娘生下的亲兄弟都有几样心，合作社干活却是一股劲。
      自留的土地大大减少
      四川省万县龙宝乡岩上村向名海农业生产合作社的田地，都是夹沙土和黄泥巴，土质不好又缺水源。但因社员们集体改进生产技术，大量积肥，因地种植作物，一九五三年比一九五二年增产了四成多。全社社员都过上了中农生活，成为当地农民组织起来集体生产的榜样。
      农业生产合作社多打了粮食的事实，教育社员们认识到：只有组织起来，依靠大家努力才能共同富裕。过去，大家都是把田入股而不把地入股，现在每个社员除了留二升菜园地外，都全部入了股。全社社员的自耕地由占全社土地的百分之十减少到百分之三，社员们不再只关心个人的地，而是关心全社的田地了。社员张才连，过去在社里不好好劳动，经过开会，大家从思想上启发帮助他改正缺点，他的觉悟提高了，积极参加了社内各种活动。社员之间也都是抱着互相关心的态度，社员陈子元一度缺粮，社员向名春主动借给了他四升麦子。社员范世珍有一次生病，社员们就把她抬到医院，由社内拿出十万元作为医药费，解决了她无钱治病的困难。现在全社已有向名海、张和银、向士凤等三人参加了共产党，范世珍加入了青年团，他们说：“我们一定要好好领导大家，走向集体农庄。”
                                      （甘萃）
    把合作社叫做“咱社”了
      陕西省大荔县马廷海农业生产合作社的社员，现在，普遍把生产合作社亲切地叫做“咱社”。刚成立社时，有些社员对使用公共农具不爱惜，乱拉乱丢，认为“弄坏了也没有什么关系”。现在大多数人的看法不同了，对社里一点一滴东西，都爱护起来。六十多岁的左丕基老汉，只要看到牲口遗下粪，他就要设法拾起来。社员刘鹏飞入社时，非常耽心自己的地界石被人拔了，将来出社时，找不到畔子；因此把原来的界石埋在地下，上边另栽了一棵桑树。经过一年来的集体劳动，他已改变了看法，认识了那种思想和作法就到不了社会主义社会。一九五三年社里种麦时，他自动地把树和界石挖了出来。社员张小来入社的五亩沙水地，过去都种花生，秋季收入全指靠着它。去年社里又在这块地上种了花生，秋里雨多，不幸全被水淹了，但因为是按劳、按股合理分配，所以他家的秋季收入还比去年多的多，他感动地说：“如果不是农业生产合作社，我就不得了。”社员马顺有原先怕收入少，想退社单干。最近，计算了一下一九五三年收入的粮食比一九五二年多三、四石时，高兴的不但不提退社了，并表示要坚决跟着共产党走到社会主义去。
      一心一意办好社
    宁夏省平罗县莫如信农业生产合作社的社员们，在集体劳动中不断受到教育，思想上起了很大变化。去年生产当中，刘尽忠、刘天启等四户社员为了耕种方便，自动挖去自己的田埂，使相连的小块地合成了一大块。李耀珍（青年团员）负责喂社内牲口，有一次晚上一头骡子病了，他就叫了几个人给灌药，别人休息了，他又把骡子拉到外面转，一夜未睡。他说：“庄稼户一条牛，性命就在里头。社内公共的骡子，就越要爱惜哩。”军属李明信，看到社内照顾自己的困难，就更积极领导妇女社员参加生产。去年分配收入以后，大体算了一下，她家可余三千多斤粮，有人给她出主意，劝她把余粮卖了后，除穿用外，可以再多买几只羊，自己喂。但是，李明信的想法不是这样，她把卖粮的款一百万元投放到社里了。她说：“我自己先不买羊，明年我们再吸收新社员的话，防备有的人还有困难，要给调剂。我要先帮助他们，不能光想自己好。”
    爱国，爱社，爱社友
      河南省南乐县古寺廊村杨运兴农业生产合作社，成立两年来连年增产的事实，使社员更加热爱农业生产合作社了。去年庄稼快成熟时，社员们争着夜里下地看庄稼，保管委员杨成轩，曾经一夜下过三趟地；张同书的娘五十多岁了，也要求下地看花生。社员崔锁成主动地修理社内损坏了的农具。以往下雨，大家都是往屋里跑，现在每逢下雨都忙着往社里、场上跑，收拾社里的东西。社员们了解，社里的集体利益都和自己的利益紧紧的联系在一起。社员之间，进一步发扬了友爱和睦团结的精神。过去有人得了病没人理，现在只要听说谁有病，都要去看一看，问一问，又是请医生，又是抓药。社员刘文保在病中被社友们的友爱精神感动得流泪。
    集体主义思想表现在政治上的，是爱国主义思想觉悟的提高。社员们除积极交纳爱国公粮外，还把自己社内棵选、穗选的优良品种卖给国家，由政府把良种推广出去，提高农业生产。他们在一九五三年十月前，就曾把余粮一千六百八十斤麦子、六千四百二十斤粗粮卖给了国家。另外，该社在和群众合伙烧砖时，社外群众少报了二十万元税，社员们立刻就提出补报上了。
      树立了爱国互助风气
    江西省余江县乐玉柱农业生产合作社的社员们，在集体劳动中和党的教育下，树立了爱国互助的风气。去年在国家购粮时，他们首先带头把一万斤余粮卖给了国家。稻子收割后，并自动拿出试验成功的优良品种八千四百一十五斤，换给全县各地农民备用。去年，女社员江秋花手上生疮，不能洗衣服，社内妇女林冬花主动代她家洗衣二十多天，秋花感动地说：“要是过去，衣服臭了也没人管，这真是合作的好处啊！”
