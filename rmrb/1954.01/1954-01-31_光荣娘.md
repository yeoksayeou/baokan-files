What I Saw of Military Dependents

　　"Glorious Mother"
　　In Yangtang Township, Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, there is a village called Yu Village. The women's director in this village is named Zheng Xuexiang. However, the villagers are accustomed to calling her "Glorious Mother."
　　Zheng Xuexiang is already forty-four years old and has three sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Jiang Xueliang, is a Communist Party member and serves as a platoon leader in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The third son, Youmei, and two daughters, Caifeng and Cailian, are all attending elementary school. The family has more than eleven mu of land, mainly cultivated by herself and her second son, Fengmei. Last year, after she joined the mutual aid group, the rice harvest was abundant, with a yield of four thousand five hundred jin of grain alone. The family also bought two pigs and added three new quilts and six sets of clothes.
　　Before liberation, her family was not like this. In 1942, her husband was killed by the Japanese devils. Unable to make a living, she hired out her two teenage sons to landlords to herd cattle, sent the eleven-year-old Caifeng to someone else as a child bride, and had to work as a cook for the landlord's family herself. The family was scattered in all directions.
　　In late December of last year, she attended the township people's congress, where she studied and discussed the general line of the country's transition period. Recalling the past, and thinking about the present and future, she said: "Chairman Mao's general line is absolutely correct. If we don't take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, we still can't withstand the storms and the roots of poverty can never be eradicated!" After calculating carefully, she sold all of her one thousand seven hundred jin of surplus grain to the state.

### “光荣娘”

　　“光荣娘”
    浙江省兰溪县杨塘乡有个俞家村，这村子里的妇女主任叫郑雪香。可是，村里的人总习惯称她为“光荣娘”。
    郑雪香已经四十四岁了，有三个儿子两个女儿。大儿子叫江学良，是共产党员，在中国人民解放军某部当排长。三儿子有梅和两个女儿彩凤、彩连，都在小学校念书，家里十一亩多地，主要由她自己和二儿子凤梅耕种。去年她参加了互助组后，稻子获得了丰收，光谷子就收了四千五百斤。家里还买了两口猪，新添了三床被子、六套衣服。
    解放前，她家里可不是这种样子。一九四二年，她丈夫被日本鬼子杀死了，生活没有办法，就把两个才十几岁的男孩子雇给地主放牛、十一岁的彩凤送给人家当童养媳，自己也只好给地主家做饭。一家人，弄得七分八散的。
    去年十二月下旬，她参加了乡人民代表大会，学习和讨论了国家过渡时期的总路线，她回忆了过去，又想到了现在和将来，她说：“毛主席定的这条总路线一点也不错。要不走互助合作的道路，还是经不起风吹雨打，穷根子永远也去不掉！”她算了一下细帐，就把自己的一千七百斤余粮，全部卖给了国家。
