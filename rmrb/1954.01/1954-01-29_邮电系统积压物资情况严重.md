　　Serious Situation of Overstocked Materials in the Postal and Telecommunications System
    Reader Li Zonglin writes: I was transferred to the Jiangsu Postal and Telecommunications Administration in August last year to be responsible for the disposal of overstocked and surplus materials. I found that the situation of overstocked materials in the Jiangsu Postal and Telecommunications Administration was very serious. The total value of overstocked and surplus materials in the bureau reached over 60 billion yuan, most of which can be utilized, and some equipment can even be used nationwide for two or three years. The bureau is overstocked with twenty or thirty carrier machines, which can be used with slight repairs. However, the Nanjing Postal and Telecommunications Bureau under the administration purchased carrier machines from abroad last year at the cost of 300 million yuan per unit. In 1951, the bureau was entrusted by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to order 2,000 automatic telephone sets from the state-owned Nanjing Radio Factory. Up to now, not a single one has been allocated. Due to the long storage time and improper storage, green mold has been found on the telephones, and the coils and sound quality have been affected. However, in 1953, the bureau was entrusted by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to continue ordering goods from the Nanjing Radio Factory. Now, the Nanjing warehouse under the bureau alone has over 10,000 telephone sets in stock. The bureau has over 80,000 meters of various specifications of wire in stock, which can meet the needs of all line equipment of a medium-sized postal and telecommunications bureau.
    The above-mentioned overstocked materials were previously "kept in custody on behalf of the Ministry" by the Jiangsu Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration; the bureau had no right to dispose of them without the approval of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. At the end of each quarter, the bureau prepared a list of the quantity of inventory materials and reported it to the ministry, but the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has never given any instructions on how to deal with these materials. The bureau also has a simple task-oriented view, simply sending forms on schedule, but failing to actively report the serious situation of overstocked materials to the ministry.
    This serious situation of overstocked materials also exists in other units of the postal and telecommunications departments. According to my understanding, as of the end of last year, the national postal and telecommunications system had approximately 600 billion yuan worth of materials in stock. What an astonishing figure! At present, the postal and telecommunications departments have paid preliminary attention to this issue and strengthened the material processing agencies of postal and telecommunications bureaus at all levels. However, in order to learn from past lessons and improve future work, the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should also investigate the reasons for the large accumulation of materials and formulate specific measures so that the country's useful materials will no longer be stockpiled in warehouses, but can play their role in large-scale economic construction.

### 邮电系统积压物资情况严重

专栏：读者来信摘要

　　邮电系统积压物资情况严重
    读者李宗琳来信：我在去年八月份被调到江苏邮电管理局负责积余物资的处理工作，发现江苏邮电管理局积压物资的情况很严重。该局积余物资总值达六百多亿元，其中绝大部分都是可以利用的，有些器材甚至可供全国使用两三年。该局积压着二、三十部载波机，只要稍加修理就可使用；而该局所属南京邮电局去年却以每部三亿元的代价向国外购买载波机。在一九五一年该局受邮电部委托向国营南京有线电厂订购的二千部自动话机，直到现在一部也没调拨出去，由于积压时间过久和保管不善，话机上已发现有绿色霉斑，线圈和音质都受到影响；可是，该局在一九五三年又受邮电部委托继续向南京有线电厂订货，现在仅该局所属南京仓库就积压了上万部话机。该局积压各种规格的电线有八万多公尺，可供中等邮电局全部线路设备的需要。
    上述各项积压物资，以前都是江苏省邮电管理局“代部保管”的；如果不经中央邮电部批准，该局无权处理。在每个季度末，该局都把库存物资数量造具清册报部，但是中央邮电部一直没有交代过处理这批物资的办法。而该局也有着单纯任务观点，只是按期造送表册，却没有把积压物资的严重情况积极向部里反映。
    这种积压物资的严重情况，在邮电部门其他单位也是存在的。据我了解，截至去年年底止，全国邮电系统积存物资约值六千多亿元。这是个多么惊人的数字！目前，邮电部门对这个问题已引起了初步重视，加强了各级邮电局的物资处理机构。但是，为了接受过去教训，改进今后工作，中央邮电部还应该检查一下造成大量物资积压的原因，并订出具体措施，使国家有用的物资不再被积压在仓库里，而能在大规模的经济建设中发挥它们的作用。
