People's living standards gradually improve in people's democratic countries
Poland, Bulgaria and other countries increase production of daily necessities to meet people's needs

(Xinhua News Agency, 6th) Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, while developing heavy industry in 1953, also correspondingly developed light industry to meet the needs of urban and rural residents.

In the first four years of Poland's Six-Year Plan (1950-1955), due to the appropriate development of light industry, in 1953 alone, the textile industry supplied the country's residents with 498 million meters of cotton fabrics, nearly 67 million meters of woolen fabrics, and nearly 67 million meters of silk fabrics. By the end of 1953, new giant textile factories had been established in Piotrków, Andrychów, Biliayev, Pabianice, and Waranow, a man-made fiber factory had been established in Chorzow, and two man-made fiber factories had been rebuilt in Tomaszów and Szczecin. In addition, Poland's local industries and production cooperative enterprises also expanded the production of daily necessities. In 1953, Polish local industrial enterprises produced more than 700 new types of consumer goods, and production cooperative enterprises produced about 250 new types of goods. The newly manufactured items include sewing machines, refined furniture, indoor ventilators, electric dust removers, floor scrubbing machines, and necessities for farmers.

Romania's light industrial production increased significantly in 1953. Compared with 1938, ready-made clothing has increased 14 times, cotton knitwear has almost increased 8 times, woolen knitwear has increased 4 times, leather shoes have increased more than 3 times, and cotton and woolen fabrics have increased 1.5 times and 2 times respectively. In 1953, Romania's light industry over-fulfilled the plan by producing an additional 1.2 million meters of woolen and silk fabrics, 20,000 pieces of leather goods, and many other goods. In 1953, the factories equipped with domestic machinery and put into production in Romania included: a hemp processing factory, a flax processing factory, and a cotton processing factory.

Bulgaria's light industry development has also achieved great success. In the nine years since the establishment of the people's government, many light industrial enterprises have been rebuilt and newly built. These include textile factories in Sofia, Gabrovo, and Plovdiv, and a shoe factory, etc. Compared with 1939 before the war, the output of light industry in 1953 had increased 4.5 times. The production of the textile industry has also greatly increased. Among them, socks have increased 22 times, silk fabrics have increased 4 times, and woolen fabrics have increased 2 times. The variety of fabrics has also increased from 57 in 1944 to 180. Bulgaria had many new light industrial factories completed in 1953. The giant textile factory that started production in Plovdiv in early December 1953—the Maritsa Textile Factory—is equipped with 30,000 spindles. In 1954, the factory will produce 2.6 million meters of textiles, 4 million pairs of socks, and 235,000 pieces of knitted outerwear.

    波罗保等国增产日用品满足人民需要
   【新华社六日讯】波兰、罗马尼亚和保加利亚一九五三年在发展重工业的同时，也相应地发展了轻工业，以供应城乡居民的需要。
    波兰在六年计划（一九五○—一九五五年）的头四年中，由于适当地发展了轻工业，一九五三年单是纺织工业就供给全国居民四亿九千八百万公尺的棉织品，近六千七百万公尺的毛织品和近六千七百万公尺的丝织品。到一九五三年年底，在比亚特尔科夫、安德里佐夫、贝里雅夫、巴比安尼斯、瓦兰诺夫等地已建立起新的巨型纺织工厂，在霍若夫已建立起一个人造纤维工厂，在托马索夫和斯才新已改建了两个人造纤维工厂。此外，波兰的地方工业和生产合作社企业也扩大了日用品的生产。一九五三年波兰地方工业企业共生产了七百多种新式消费品，生产合作社企业共生产了约二百五十种新式物品。新制造的物品包括：缝纫机、精制家具、室内通风器、电力除尘器、擦地板的机器以及农民用的必需品等。
    罗马尼亚的轻工业生产在一九五三年中已有很大增加。和一九三八年相比，现成服装已增为十四倍，棉针织品几乎增加到八倍，毛针织品增为四倍，皮鞋增加到三倍以上，棉、毛织品分别增加到一倍半和两倍。一九五三年罗马尼亚的轻工业超计划增产了一百二十万公尺的毛织品和丝织品，二万件皮货和其他许多货品。一九五三年罗马尼亚用国产机器装备起来并投入生产的工厂有：一个大麻加工工厂、一个亚麻加工工厂和一个棉花加工工厂。
    保加利亚轻工业的发展也获得了巨大的成就。在人民政权建立以来的九年中，已改建和新建了许多轻工业企业。其中包括索非亚、加布罗沃和普罗夫迪夫的纺织工厂和一个制鞋工厂等。和战前一九三九年比较，一九五三年轻工业的产量已增为四点五倍。纺织工业的生产也大大增加了。其中袜类增为二十二倍，丝织品增为四倍，毛织品增为二倍。织品的种类也从一九四四年的五十七种增加到一百八十种。保加利亚在一九五三年中已有不少新型的轻工业工厂建筑完工。一九五三年十二月初在普罗夫迪夫开工生产的巨型纺织工厂——马里查纺织工厂，装备有三万个纱锭。一九五四年该厂将生产二百六十万公尺纺织品，四百万双袜子和二十三万五千件针织外衣。
