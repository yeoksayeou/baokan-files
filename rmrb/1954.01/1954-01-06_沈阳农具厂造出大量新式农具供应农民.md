The Shenyang Farm Tool Factory, which is directly responsible for providing new production tools for agricultural collectivization, manufactured over 100,000 new farm implements for farmers from 1949 to the end of 1953. These included more than 30 types, such as Soviet-style double-wheeled single-share plows for plowing, ten-row seeders for planting, cultivator hoes for weeding, disc harrows for breaking soil, and sprayers for pest control. These new farm tools not only met the production needs of the vast number of farmers in rural areas of Northeast China, but also played a significant role in promoting agricultural collectivization, increasing grain production, improving farmers' lives, and supporting national economic construction.

Currently, after studying the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, the workers of the Shenyang Farm Tool Factory have further recognized the importance of their production, and their enthusiasm for production has generally increased. Young lathe operator Feng Zhanlin said: "In order to help our farmer brothers embark on the road to common prosperity and accelerate the industrialization of our motherland, our team is determined to improve product quality and ensure that we overfulfill our tasks!" The workers and technicians who are trial-producing tractor-drawn twenty-four-row seeders feel even more honored by their task. In order to make a successful trial production as soon as possible, the welders and riveters are working outdoors in the bitter cold wind and snow. Sometimes their hands become so frozen that they can't hold the tools, but they still persist in their work. The workers said: "An early success in the trial production of this large seeder will promote our socialist happy life to come sooner!" This twenty-four-row large seeder can be pulled by six Soviet-style heavy-duty crawler tractors, and with ten hours of operation per day, the seeding area can reach 960 mu, which is 19 times more efficient than the current horse-drawn ten-row seeder. This giant seeder will be put into mass production next year.

    沈阳农具厂造出大量新式农具供应农民
    直接担负着为农业集体化提供新式生产工具的沈阳农具厂，从一九四九年到一九五三年底前止，已为农民制造了十几万件新式农具。其中包括翻地用的苏式双轮一铧犁、种地用的十行播种机、锄地用的铲趟机、破土用的圆盘耙、杀虫用的喷雾器等三十多种。这些新式农具不但供应了东北各地农村广大农民生产上的需要，而且在促进农业集体化，增产粮食、改善农民生活、支援国家经济建设等各方面，都起了重大的作用。
    目前，沈阳农具厂的职工们，经过国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务的学习，进一步认识到自己生产的重要性，因此，生产热情普遍高涨。青年车工冯占林说：“为了帮助农民兄弟走大家富裕的道路，加速我们祖国的工业化，我们小组坚决提高产品质量，保证超额完成任务！”正在试制拖拉机牵引的二十四行播种机的工人和技术员们，更感到自己任务的光荣。为了早日试制成功，熔焊铆合的工人们冒着严寒的风雪，露天进行工作，有的时候两手冻僵了把不住工具，仍在坚持着工作，工人们说：“这种大型播种机早试制成功一天，都会促进我们的社会主义幸福生活早日到来！”这种二十四行大型播种机用苏式重型履带拖拉机可以牵引六台，每天作业十小时，播种面积可达九百六十亩，比现在马拉十行播种机的效率提高十九倍。这种巨型播种机，明年即可大批投入生产。
