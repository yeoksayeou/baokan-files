    Northeast China's rural areas have made significant progress in winter manure collection work, thanks to inspections and promotion by leadership at all levels.
    Due to heavy rainfall in the spring and autumn of last year in Northeast China, many areas failed to complete their manure collection tasks during the slack farming season, the main period for this work. By the end of November, most regions had only collected about half the amount of manure compared to previous years. The Northeast Agricultural Bureau, upon discovering this situation, immediately issued a notice requiring all localities to mobilize the masses to carry out winter manure collection in conjunction with the general line propaganda. It also organized work teams to go deep into the rural areas to focus on inspection and promotion. Since then, manure collection work has greatly improved. According to statistics from early January, the amount of manure collected in the entire region has reached 70% of that in previous years. In Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, some areas have collected about 90% of the manure required for their fertilization plans. In Fuxian County, many farmers are actively collecting manure, storing it in pits or sealing it with mud to prevent nutrient loss. Coastal farmers are actively hauling sea mud to their fields. Farmers who have sold surplus grain have bought a lot of manure and chemical fertilizers. Shuangcheng County in Songjiang Province has organized the transportation of urban manure to the countryside in a planned way. The county's agricultural departments, in conjunction with relevant units, have conducted surveys of manure sources, assessed manure prices, and planned distribution. They have planned to distribute more than 3,000 cartloads of human waste from the hygiene company, more than 1,000 cartloads of yellow manure from twenty-seven large cart inns, and more than 41,000 cartloads of silt from seven sewage ponds to more than fifty villages that have traditionally relied on urban manure. The village governments will then organize farmers to use carts returning from the city after delivering sugar beets and grain to transport it back.
    The current problem is that the manure collection movement is not developing evenly enough. Some areas have relaxed their leadership over manure collection during grain purchases, and some farmers have a mentality of relying on chemical fertilizers. These factors are hindering the completion of the manure collection plan. All localities must make further efforts to strive to complete the entire manure collection plan. (Chen Jiaqi)

    东北农村积肥工作有进展
    东北农村的冬季积肥工作在各级领导机关的检查和推动下已获得很大进展。
    东北各地由于去年夏秋雨水较多，很多地方在主要积肥季节的挂锄期间都没有完成积肥任务。到十一月底止，大部地区积肥数量仅及往年的一半左右。东北农业局发现这一情况，立即发出通知，要求各地结合总路线宣传发动群众开展冬季积肥工作。并组织工作组深入农村，重点进行检查推动。自此以后，积肥工作大有起色。据一月上旬统计，全区积肥数量已达往年百分之七十。辽东凤城县有的地方积肥数量已达施肥计划的百分之九十左右，复县很多农民积极拣粪，并把拣得的粪窖起来或用泥封存起来，避免肥分流失。沿海农民正在纷纷向地里拉海泥。卖出余粮后的农民已买了很多大粪和化学肥料。松江省双城县并有计划地组织城粪下乡。该县农业部门联合各有关单位分别进行调查粪源、评定粪价、计划分配等工作，把卫生公司的三千多车人粪尿、二十七个大车店的一千多车黄粪、七处污水池里的四万一千多车淤泥等，有计划地分配给历年有拉城粪习惯的五十多个村，由村政府组织农民利用送甜菜、运粮等进城的大车运回。
    目前存在的问题是积肥运动还开展得不够平衡，有的地方在购粮中放松了对积肥的领导，有些农民有依赖化学肥料的思想，这些都妨碍了积肥计划的完成，各地必须进一步努力，争取完成全部积肥计划。            （陈家麒）
