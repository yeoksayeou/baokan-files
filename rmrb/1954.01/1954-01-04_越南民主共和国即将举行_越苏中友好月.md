Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency on the 1st, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will hold a Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month throughout the country starting from January 18, 1954, based on the suggestions of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association and the Vietnam-China Friendship Association. To this end, the Central Organizing Committee of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month issued a statement to the people of the whole country on January 1st.

The statement said that our people's war of resistance against the French colonialists, American interventionists, and their puppets has continuously developed and achieved brilliant victories. The achievement of these victories is due to the heroic and long-term, arduous, self-reliant war of resistance waged by all the people of our country under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party; however, the achievement of these victories should also be attributed to the warm sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, especially the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries. In the past eight years of the war of resistance, the solidarity and friendship between us and our brother countries have been greatly strengthened.

However, with the development of the war of resistance, it is necessary to step up the study of the valuable experience of the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries, and to consolidate and expand our solidarity and friendship with brother countries.

Therefore, based on the suggestions of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association and the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnam National United Front decided to hold a friendship month with brother countries throughout the country from January 18, 1954 (the anniversary of the mutual dispatch of diplomatic envoys with friendly countries) to February 18, 1954, named the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month.

The purpose of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month is:

One, to strengthen the internationalist spirit of the Vietnamese people;

Two, to strengthen the solidarity between the Vietnamese people and the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries;

Three, to learn from the struggle and production experiences of the people of brother countries, to learn from their spirit of self-reliance, to promote Vietnam's war of resistance, and to implement land reform to achieve "land to the tiller."

The Central Organizing Committee of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month is composed of representatives from the government, the army, various ethnic groups, various parties, and mass organizations, with Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front and Chairman of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association, as its chairman.

The statement finally called on all the people to actively carry out the preparations for the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, and to launch competitions to achieve successes to welcome the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, and to contribute to winning national independence and defending lasting world peace.

    越南民主共和国即将举行“越苏中友好月”
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社一日讯：根据越苏友好协会和越中友好协会的建议，越南民主共和国将从一九五四年一月十八日起在越南全国举行越苏中友好月。为此，越苏中友好月中央组织委员会在一月一日向全国人民发表声明。
    声明说，我国人民反对法国殖民者、美国干涉者和他们的傀儡的抗战已不断地发展并不断取得了辉煌的胜利。这些胜利的取得，是由于我国全体人民在胡志明主席和越南劳动党的英明领导下，英勇地进行了长期的、艰苦的自力更生的抗战；但是，这些胜利的取得也应归功于全世界爱好和平的人民，特别是苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家人民的热烈同情和支援。在过去八年的抗战中，我们与兄弟国家之间的团结和友谊已大大地加强了。
    可是，随着抗战的发展，就有必要加紧学习苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家人民的宝贵经验，并巩固和扩大我们与兄弟国家的团结和友谊。
    所以，根据越苏友好协会和越中友好协会的建议，胡志明主席、越南政府和越南国民联合战线决定从一九五四年一月十八日（即与友好国家互派外交使节纪念日）起，到一九五四年二月十八日止，在全国举行与兄弟国家的友好月，定名为越苏中友好月。
    越苏中友好月的目的是：
    一、加强越南人民的国际主义精神；
    二、加强越南人民与苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家人民的团结；
    三、学习兄弟国家人民的斗争和生产的经验，学习他们自力更生的精神，以推进越南的抗战，并实行土地改革达到“耕者有其田”。
    越苏中友好月中央组织委员会是由政府、军队、各民族、各党派和群众团体的代表组成的，以越南国民联合战线全国委员会主席兼越苏友好协会主席孙德胜为主席。
    声明最后号召全体人民积极进行越苏中友好月的筹备工作，并发动竞赛，取得成就来迎接越苏中友好月，为赢得民族独立，为保卫世界持久和平作出贡献。
