Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th. Our correspondent reports: The Swiss delegation and the Swedish delegation in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) issued statements separately on the 14th, expressing their agreement with the proposal made by General Thimayya, Chairman of the NNRC, to hand over the prisoners of war who had not exercised their right to repatriation to their original detaining sides before January 23rd.

It is clear to everyone that the Swiss and Swedish delegations have been openly echoing the U.S. side's unreasonable demand that prisoners of war must be "released" by January 22nd. According to the U.S.-announced "timetable" for forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the Swedish Commissioner had proposed in the NNRC that prisoners of war not being directly repatriated be "released" as civilians on January 22nd in order to cloak the U.S.'s actions of violating international agreements and forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war with a "legal" veneer. The Swiss Commissioner immediately came out to support the Swedish Commissioner's proposal. However, this proposal was rejected in the NNRC. The Swiss and Swedish delegations then turned to support General Thimayya's proposal.

In their statements, the Swiss and Swedish delegations also stated that they were not completely satisfied with Thimayya's proposal. The Swiss delegation even expressed "objections" to the fact that this proposal did not "release" the prisoners of war as civilians like the Swedish Commissioner's proposal, so that the U.S. side could "legally" forcibly detain them. However, this difference did not prevent the Swiss and Swedish delegations from agreeing to Thimayya's proposal "in principle." Because the U.S. side believes that the so-called act of handing over prisoners of war to their original detaining side is a "unilateral release" of prisoners of war, the Swiss and Swedish Commissioners expressed satisfaction. To justify this behavior of acting according to U.S. intentions, the Swiss delegation's statement also said that this was "for humanitarian reasons." However, humanity lies in people's hearts. From the Swiss delegation's past records of violating the "Terms of Reference" and from the Swiss delegation's current claims that violate the "Terms of Reference," it is difficult for people to find a trace of humanity. People remember that the Swiss and Swedish Commissioners, in the "individual report" recently published to cover up the U.S. side's sabotage of the explanation work, had to admit: "The organizations in the South Camp have very strict control over the prisoners of war who request repatriation, so the latter often have to apply for repatriation secretly and at the risk of their lives," "In fact, several murders have occurred in the South Camp"; however, the Swiss and Swedish delegations hindered the NNRC from taking effective sanction measures against U.S. agents according to the "Terms of Reference," so that the agents could rampantly persecute and slaughter Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in the camp using inhumane and brutal means, preventing the repatriation of prisoners of war. Now, the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in the South Camp are anxiously waiting for the explanation, so that they have the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation and return to their motherland; however, the Swiss and Swedish Commissioners oppose continuing the explanation and advocate handing over the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to the U.S. side, which will result in them falling into the hands of the Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to suffer torture and slaughter, and being forced to serve as cannon fodder for the Chiang and Li bandit gangs to carry out adventurous gambles. In this way, can the actions of the Swiss and Swedish Commissioners still be concealed by "for humanitarian reasons"?

### 瑞士瑞典代表按照美方意旨办事  出面支持蒂迈雅交还战俘的片面建议

    瑞士瑞典代表按照美方意旨办事
    出面支持蒂迈雅交还战俘的片面建议
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者报道：中立国遣返委员会中的瑞士代表团及瑞典代表团，十四日分别发表声明，表示同意中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军关于在一月二十三日以前把未曾行使遣返权利的战俘交还给原拘留方面的建议。
    人们都看到，瑞士及瑞典代表团最近以来一直在公开附和着美方所谓战俘必须在一月二十二日“释放”的无理主张。按照美方宣布的强迫扣留朝中战俘的“时间表”，瑞典委员曾在中立国遣返委员会中提出提案，规定在一月二十二日把不直接遣返的战俘“释放”成为平民，以给美方破坏国际协议强迫扣留朝中战俘的行动披上“合法”的外衣。瑞士委员也马上出来支持瑞典委员的提案。但是，这个提案在中立国遣返委员会中被否决了。瑞士及瑞典代表团就转而支持蒂迈雅将军的建议。
    瑞士和瑞典代表团在他们的声明中还表示对蒂迈雅的建议不完全满足。对于这个建议没有像瑞典委员的提案那样把战俘“释放”成为平民使美方能“合法地”加以强迫扣留，瑞士代表团还表示有“反对意见”。但是，这个分歧并没有妨碍瑞士及瑞典代表团“在原则上”同意蒂迈雅的建议。因为美方认为所谓将战俘交还原拘留方的行为就是“片面释放”战俘，所以瑞士和瑞典委员也就表示满意了。为了替这种按美方意旨办事的行为辩解，瑞士代表团声明中又说这是“为了人道的理由”。然而，人道自在人心，从瑞士代表团过去历次违反“职权范围”的纪录中，从瑞士代表团目前违反“职权范围”的主张中，人们是很难找到人道的影子的。人们记得，瑞士和瑞典委员一道在最近发表的掩饰美方破坏解释工作活动的“个别报告”中也不得不承认：南营存在的“组织对要求遣返的战俘控制很严，因此后者常常不得不秘密地并冒着生命危险来申请遣返”，“事实上南营里曾发生了好几起凶杀案”；但是，瑞士和瑞典代表团却阻挠中立国遣返委员会根据“职权范围”对美方特务采取有效制裁措施，而使特务在营场中得以气焰嚣张，用惨无人道的残暴手段迫害和屠杀朝中战俘，阻止战俘遣返。现在，南营中朝中战俘在焦急地等待着解释，以便有机会行使他们的遣返权利回到他们的祖国；但是，瑞士及瑞典委员却反对继续解释，而主张把朝中战俘交给美方，其结果就要使他们落在李承晚及蒋介石匪帮手中去遭受酷刑和屠杀，并被迫充当蒋李匪帮进行冒险赌博的炮灰。这样，瑞士和瑞典委员的行为难道还能用“为了人道的理由”来加以掩饰吗？
