    Educate the Broad Masses to Protect Historical Relics
    Reader Jing Hongjun writes: Educating the broad masses to protect historical relics has successful examples in Henan Province.
    Henan Province is rich in cultural and artistic heritage. During the period of reactionary rule, many precious cultural relics were destroyed and stolen by imperialists, reactionary rulers, and treacherous merchants like Yue Bin. After liberation, under the education of the People's Government, protecting historical relics became a conscious action of the people in various parts of Henan Province. For example, farmers near Longmen, Luoyang, often used their spare time during slack farming seasons to find stone Buddhas and stone carvings that had been stolen by imperialists but not yet transported away, and sent them to the local People's Government for transfer to the cultural relics preservation institute for proper safekeeping. After the discovery of a Neolithic cultural site and Han tomb complex in Houying Village, Third District, Tangyin County, local people automatically formed a "Cultural Relics Protection Team" to prevent damage and illegal sales. Farmers in the village also consciously donated a large number of antiquities previously kept at home to the state, including more than a hundred pieces of stone axes, pottery jars, granaries, urns, pots, stoves (including woks and steamers), bowls, plates, wells, troughs, tripods, li-tripods, ?, bronze mirrors, iron swords, and porcelain of various dynasties. This mass protection of cultural relics has been commended by the Anyang Special Commissioner's Office. Farmers in Butaizhai Village, Mianchi County (located five miles east of Yangshao Village, the namesake region of "Yangshao Culture," a residential site of primitive human society in China), have handed over various ancient stone production tools and other artifacts collected in their daily lives to the government. Shi Liuzhu, twelve years old, and Shi Zhuhua, ten years old, each donated three stone axes. Farmer Shi Xiyuan donated three stone chisels and five stone arrowheads. Some people also donated valuable pottery-making tools—"mud paddles" and various pottery items. When farmers in Nanmeixi Village, Baiquan, Huixian County, discovered ancient bowls while leveling the land, inside the bowls were two silver ingots and more than twenty pieces of gold jewelry, which they automatically handed over to the local cultural center for preservation. Last spring, farmers in Hougeda, Wanliu Village, Gugou Township, Ninth District, Wuyang County, discovered a large layer of ash underground and unearthed stone arrowheads, stone adzes, stone axes, animal bones, bird bones, turtle shells, clam shells, and painted pottery shards, all of which were given to the government. When Zhang Dongmu and Wang Suying, farmers in Taipu Village, Taipu Township, Jia County, dug up a large number of ancient bronze artifacts while plowing and accumulating fertilizer in the spring, they immediately reported to the government. When cultural relics cadres from the Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau went to investigate, the villagers donated more than eighty pieces of various sizes of bronze artifacts (including ding-tripods, ?, gui-bowls, fu-vessels, pan-basins, jian-mirrors, bu-jars, and hu-pots, all similar to the bronze artifacts unearthed in Xinzheng during the Spring and Autumn period) and assisted the cadres in discovering a large number of polished stone tool Neolithic cultural sites. From the above examples, we can see the broad masses' love for the motherland's culture. They will never allow any of the motherland's national cultural heritage to be lost or damaged. Therefore, severely punishing treacherous merchants like Yue Bin, who steal and sell the motherland's cultural relics, is also the just demand of the broad masses.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    教育广大人民保护历史文物
    读者井鸿钧来信：教育广大人民保护历史文物，在河南省有着成功的事例。
    河南省蕴藏着极其丰富的文化、艺术遗产。在反动统治时期，许多珍贵的文物被帝国主义者、反动统治者和岳彬之流的奸商所破坏和盗窃了。解放后，河南省各地人民在人民政府的教育下，保护历史文物成为人民的自觉的行动。例如，洛阳龙门附近的农民们经常在农闲期把过去被帝国主义分子所盗窃而尚未运走的石佛、石刻找回来送到当地区人民政府转交文物保管所妥善保管起来。汤阴县三区后营村发现了新石器时代文化遗址和汉墓群，当地群众就自动成立了“保护文物小组”以防止破坏和盗卖；该村农民并自觉地将过去保存在家里的大批古物献给国家，计捐出石斧、陶罐、仓、瓮、壶、灶（包括锅蒸）、碗、盘、井、槽、鼎、鬲、?、铜镜、铁剑，以及历代瓷器百余件。这种群众性的保护文物的做法，已经受到了安阳专署的通报表扬。渑池县不台寨村（在我国原始社会人类的居住遗址、“仰韶文化”所得名地区的仰韶村东五里）的农民纷纷把平时收集的各种古代人民石制生产工具等器物交给政府；十二岁的史留柱和十岁的史柱华等，每人都献出了三把石斧；农民史锡元献出三个石凿和五个石簇。还有一些人献出了很有价值的制陶工具—“泥拍”和各种陶器。辉县百泉南梅溪村农民在地里推土时发现古碗，碗内放元宝两个，金器首饰二十余件，就自动交给当地文化馆保存。舞阳县九区古沟乡湾刘村后疙瘩农民去春在地下发现大量灰土层并挖出石箭头、石锛、石斧、兽骨、鸟骨、鳖甲、蚌壳及彩陶片，全部送给政府。郏县太仆乡太仆村农民张东木、王素英等于春耕拉土积肥时在地下挖出了一大批古代铜器，立刻报告政府；在省文化事业管理局文物干部前往调查时，该村群众又献出大小各种铜器八十余件（包括鼎、?、簋、簠、盘、鉴、瓿、壶等，都和新郑出土的春秋时代铜器类似），并协助干部发现大量磨光石器的新石器时代的文化遗址。从以上一些事例中可以看出广大人民对祖国文化的热爱。他们决不允许让任何一点祖国的民族文化遗产遭到损失和破坏。因此，严惩盗卖祖国文物的奸商岳彬等，也正是广大人民的正义要求。
