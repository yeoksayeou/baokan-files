In the primeval forests of the northern Greater Khingan Range, the Eleventh Survey and Design Team of the Ministry of Railways has surveyed a railway and completed its design at the end of last year. This railway is the Tugen section (from Tulihe to Genhe) of the Yalin line (from Yakeshi to the Greater Khingan forests).

The northern Greater Khingan Range has 4.52 million hectares of forest area, with a reserve volume of over 390 million cubic meters. After the Tugen section is opened to traffic, it will be connected with the already-built Ku (Kuduer) Tu (Tulihe) section to form a forest railway more than 100 kilometers long, creating conditions for the development of the primeval forests of the Greater Khingan Range.

The Eleventh Survey and Design Team overcame various difficulties to conduct survey work in that uninhabited area. In winter, the temperature sometimes reached minus 40 degrees Celsius, and the measuring instruments froze and became unusable. In summer, they were attacked by mosquitoes and other insects. There are many swampy areas in the forest area, and if you are not careful when walking, you will fall into knee-deep mud. In such a long forest, there is no food and no housing. They had to bring food and vegetables from Harbin and set up temporary tents as dormitories. Here, place names cannot be found on the map, and it is necessary to explore and carry out surveying work, often losing direction when walking through the dense forest.

The Eleventh Survey and Design Team completed the survey and design tasks ahead of schedule under such difficult conditions. Within this 50-kilometer-long line, they surveyed 340 kilometers of lines and found four different routes for comparison and research. Finally, they found the fifth more economical and reasonable route. This saved more than 100 billion yuan in construction costs compared to the original route. They also roughly surveyed the 150-kilometer line from Genhe to Beierqi River. The Genbei line will continue to be surveyed this year. At present, the design documents for the Tugen section have been completed, and the construction department is actively preparing to start construction this year.

### 为开发大兴安岭原始森林创造条件  牙林线图根段铁路勘测设计工作已经完成

    为开发大兴安岭原始森林创造条件
    牙林线图根段铁路勘测设计工作已经完成
    在大兴安岭北部的原始森林里，铁道部第十一勘测设计总队已经测量好一条铁路，并已于去年年底做出设计。这条铁路是牙林线（从牙克石到大兴安岭森林）的图根段（从图里河到根河）。
    大兴安岭北部的森林面积有四百五十二万公顷，蓄积量有三亿九千多万立方公尺，图根段通车后，将和已经修成的库（库都鲁尔）图（图里河）段联结起来，组成一条一百多公里长的森林铁路，为开发大兴安岭的原始森林创造了条件。
    第十一勘察设计总队克服了种种困难，在那荒无人烟的地带进行勘测工作。冬天，气温有时达零下四十多度，测量仪器冻得不能使用。夏天，受到山蚊等昆虫袭击。森林区有很多泥沼地带，走路时，一不小心，就会掉进齐膝的泥淖中。在这样漫长的森林里，没有食粮，没有房屋。他们要从哈尔滨带来食粮和菜蔬，要临时搭起帐篷来做宿舍。在这里，地图上是找不到地名的，要摸索着进行测量工作，走过密密的森林，常常迷失方向。
    第十一勘测设计总队在这样困难条件下提前完成了勘测设计的任务。他们在这条五十公里长的线路内，测量了三百四十公里长的线路，曾找出四条不同的线路，来作比较和研究。最后找出了第五条比较经济的合理的线路。这比原来的线路，节省了一千多亿元的施工费。他们还草测了根河至贝尔赤河一百五十公里的线路。今年将继续勘测根贝线。目前图根段的设计文件已经做好，施工部门正积极做准备工作，在今年开始动工。
