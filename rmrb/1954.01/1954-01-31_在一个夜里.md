In a Night
    Wu Zhongxiang
    I am a volunteer soldier. Not long ago, I went to a certain place in Korea to build bridges and lived in the home of a Kim Mama. She is a glorious military family member, with three sons all participating in the People's Army. Her care for us moved us very much. I wrote this poem to express my feelings. In a night, in order to rush to repair the bridge foundation, I went to rest at dawn. "Ah Ma Ni" covered me with a cotton quilt and gently washed the mud off my feet.

  　In a night, in order to deliver cement to the bridge piers, I went to rest at dawn, which surprised me very much; "Ah Ma Ni" washed my cotton quilt and folded my cotton quilt neatly.

　  In a night, I packed my backpack and was about to leave this place. "Ah Ma Ni" held me back with tears in her eyes and gave me a full bag of corn rice.

　  Now in the night, the construction site is covered with white snow. I didn't rest at dawn either. For your happiness, "Ah Ma Ni"! I carry my gun on my chest, use tools in my hand, and I am determined to build all the bridges.

　　在一个夜里
    吴中祥
    我是个志愿军战士，不久以前到朝鲜某地架设桥梁，住在一位金妈妈家里，她是光荣的军属，有三个儿子都参加了人民军，她对我们的照顾使我们非常感动，我写这首诗以表示我的心意。在一个夜里，为了抢修桥基，黎明时才去休息，“阿妈尼”给我盖上了棉被，还轻轻地洗去我脚上的污泥。
  　在一个夜里，为了去送桥墩上的水泥，黎明时我才去休息，使我非常惊奇；“阿妈尼”洗好了我的棉被，还把我的棉被叠的整整齐齐。
　  在一个夜里，我整理背包，就要离开此地，“阿妈尼”眼泪汪汪地拉住我，送给我满满一袋包谷米。
　  现在的夜里，白雪盖满了工地，黎明时我也没休息，为了您的幸福啊，“阿妈尼”！我枪挂胸前，手使工具，决心要把所有的桥梁通通架起。
