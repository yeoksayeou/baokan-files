(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th) Marshal Kim Il Sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, sent a letter to General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on January 7, 1954, regarding the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's interim report submitted to the Korean Armistice Agreement signatories, the individual reports of the Swedish and Swiss members attached thereto, and related appendices, as well as Chairman Thimayya's letter of January 2 and the attached memorandum. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission:

	I. We have received the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's interim report submitted to the Korean Armistice Agreement signatories, the individual reports of the Swedish and Swiss members attached to the report, and related appendices. Subsequently, we received your letter of January 2, 1954, and the attached memorandum. After studying these documents, we believe that the Commission's interim report is basically factual and therefore relatively fair. In your memorandum, the Commission rightly recognizes that the extension of the explanation period is legitimate and necessary, and advocates that the explanations should continue. Undoubtedly, these are in line with the fundamental objectives of the "Terms of Reference."
    
    However, the individual reports of the Swedish and Swiss members differ greatly from the well-known facts in the prisoner-of-war camps in the southern and northern parts of the Korean Demilitarized Zone, and they basically adopt an attitude of concealing and covering up the activities of the United Nations Command in delaying and sabotaging the explanation work. Their purpose is clearly to attempt to absolve the United Nations Command of its major responsibility for undermining the explanation work and to shift this responsibility to the Korean-Chinese side. For this reason, this individual report compromises the neutral status of the Swedish and Swiss members and is completely unacceptable to the Korean-Chinese side.

    II. According to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's interim report, the grave responsibility of the United Nations Command for implementing a policy of espionage and terror to undermine the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement is already clear. The facts are as follows:

    A. Although the prisoner-of-war camps in the south are nominally under the control of the Indian Armed Forces, they are in fact still under the control of the American, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek special agent organizations, which have never been disbanded. These special agent organizations maintain close contact with and are directly commanded by the former detaining side, the United Nations Command, and their headquarters are located in Seoul, under the control of the South Korean Military Police Commander.

    B. The special agent organizations of the United Nations Command used coercive and violent acts against prisoners of war who were willing to exercise their right to repatriation, and repeatedly murdered prisoners of war who were willing to be repatriated. Not a single prisoner of war in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp dared to publicly request repatriation.

    C. The special agent organizations planned to sabotage the explanations from the beginning. They refused to allow prisoners of war to listen to the explanations and carried out sabotage and obstruction in the explanation tents through planned and organized actions. This sabotage activity is closely related to and coordinated with the obstructive attitude adopted by the United Nations Command towards the explanation work.

    D. Due to the United Nations Command's intentional delay in the construction of explanation facilities, and due to the aforementioned obstruction and sabotage activities of the special agent organizations, the Korean-Chinese side could not obtain the ninety-day explanation period and could only conduct ten days of explanation work for a very small number of prisoners of war.

    E. Due to the above points, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was unable to implement most of the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," and therefore the Commission's own legitimate duties were not completed.

    III. According to this report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the definite facts and clear responsibility for undermining the prisoner-of-war repatriation agreement and the explanation work are inescapable for the United Nations Command. However, General Hull, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, in his letter to you of January 3, 1954, not only denied this groundlessly but also attempted to accuse the Korean-Chinese side, attributing the destruction of the explanation work to our so-called "delaying tactics." This rogue behavior on the part of the United Nations Command cannot but arouse great anger among the Korean-Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world and should be severely condemned.

    IV. It should be pointed out that, according to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's interim report, while the Commission affirmed the fact that the special agent organizations commanded by the United Nations Command sabotaged the explanation work and prevented prisoners of war from requesting repatriation by force and threats of force, and at the same time, the Commission also acknowledged that the "Terms of Reference" not only did not hinder the use of force, but that Article 7 of the "Terms of Reference" also stipulated that the Commission could use force in order to perform its duties; however, on the other hand, the Commission, using various excuses, refused to take any effective measures to sanction the special agents who used violence to sabotage the explanations and coerced and murdered prisoners of war who requested repatriation. Not only that, but the Commission even further recognized the special agents who murdered prisoners of war as so-called prisoner-of-war "representatives," so that all the Commission's work had to be carried out according to the will of the special agents. In this way, the Commission, in essence, protected and supported the special agents' reign of terror in the prisoner-of-war camps, thereby enabling the special agents to freely sabotage the explanation work and freely coerce and murder prisoners of war who were willing to be repatriated. From this, it can be seen that the United Nations Command should of course bear the primary responsibility for the destruction of the "Terms of Reference" and the failure of the Commission's mission, but the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission itself cannot but bear a certain responsibility. We are dissatisfied that the interim report failed to admit this frankly, but instead, on the one hand, made many defenses for the so-called issue of not being able to use force, and on the other hand, accused our explanation plan of being "impracticable" because the Korean-Chinese side could not modify its explanation plan according to the will of the special agents. We have also noted the statements made by the Czechoslovak and Polish members regarding the interim report.

    V. According to Article 1 of the "Terms of Reference," the fundamental objective of establishing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is to ensure that all prisoners of

    就中立国遣返委员会临时报告及委员会主席来信
    金日成元帅彭德怀将军函蒂迈雅将军
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军于一九五四年一月七日就中立国遣返委员会提交朝鲜停战缔约双方的临时报告与后附的瑞典、瑞士委员的个别报告及其有关附件以及中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅一月二日的来信和附来的备忘录，致函中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅。全函如下：中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军：
    一、我们已经收到了中立国遣返委员会提交朝鲜停战缔约双方的临时报告和附在报告后面的瑞典、瑞士委员的个别报告及其有关附件。随后，我们又收到了你一九五四年一月二日的来信和附来的备忘录。在研究了这些文件之后，我们认为委员会的临时报告基本上是符合事实的，因而是比较公正的。在你的备忘录中，委员会肯定认为解释期限的延长是合法的和必要的，并主张解释应予继续。毫无疑问，这些是符合于“职权范围”的基本目标的。
    但是，瑞典、瑞士委员的个别报告则与朝鲜非军事区南部和北部两战俘营中众所周知的事实大有出入，并对联合国军方面拖延和破坏解释工作的活动，基本上采取了隐瞒和掩饰的态度。其目的显然是在企图解脱联合国军方面破坏解释工作的重大责任，并将这种责任转嫁于朝中方面。正由于此，这一个别报告是有损于瑞典、瑞士委员的中立身份而为朝中方面所完全不能接受的。
    二、根据中立国遣返委员会临时报告，联合国军方面执行特务恐怖政策来破坏朝鲜停战协定之实施的严重责任已经昭然若揭。其事实如下：
    甲、南部战俘营名义上虽属印度武装部队看管，但实际上仍然是处在美、李、蒋特务暴力组织的控制之下，这种组织从来未被打散。这种特务暴力组织与前拘留一方、即联合国军方面保持紧密联络并受其直接指挥，其总部即在汉城，受南朝鲜宪兵司令的控制。
    乙、联合国军方面的特务组织以强迫性的暴力行为施之于愿意行使遣返权利的战俘，并多次凶杀愿意遣返的战俘。东场里战俘营中没有一个战俘敢于公开要求遣返。
    丙、特务暴力组织自始即有计划地破坏解释。他们拒绝使战俘听取解释，并在解释帐篷中以有计划有组织的行动进行破坏和阻挠。他们的这种破坏活动与联合国军方面对解释工作所采取的阻挠态度是有密切联系和配合的。
    丁、由于联合国军方面有意拖延解释设备的修建，并由于特务暴力组织的上述阻挠和破坏活动，致使朝中方面不能得到九十天的解释日期，而只能向极少数的战俘进行了十天的解释工作。
    戊、由于上述各点，中立国遣返委员会没有能够将“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的大部分规定付之实施，因此，委员会本身的合法职务也就没有完成。
    三、根据中立国遣返委员会这个报告，破坏有关战俘遣返协议和解释工作的肯定事实和明确责任，是联合国军方面所无法摆脱的。然而联合国军总司令赫尔将军在其一九五四年一月三日给你的信中竟不但毫无根据地硬加否认，而且企图反噬朝中方面，将解释工作遭受破坏的原因归于所谓的我方的“拖延策略”。联合国军方面这种无赖行为不能不引起朝中人民及全世界爱好和平人民的极大愤怒，并应受到严厉的谴责。
    四、应该指出，根据中立国遣返委员会临时报告，委员会一方面肯定了联合国军方面所指挥的特务暴力组织破坏解释工作、并以武力和武力威胁阻止战俘要求遣返的事实，同时，委员会也承认了“职权范围”不但不妨碍使用武力，而且“职权范围”第七款还规定为了履行职务，委员会可以使用武力；但是，另一方面，委员会却又以种种借口，拒绝对以暴力破坏解释、胁迫并凶杀要求遣返的战俘的特务采取任何有效措施来加以制裁。不仅如此，委员会甚至更进而承认凶杀战俘的特务为所谓战俘“代表”，使委员会的一切工作都要按照特务的意志来进行。这样，委员会在实质上就保护和支持了特务在战俘营中的恐怖统治，从而使特务得以放手破坏解释工作，放手胁迫并凶杀愿意遣返的战俘。由此可见，“职权范围”之所以遭受破坏，委员会的任务之所以不能完成，联合国军方面当然应负主要责任，而中立国遣返委员会本身也是不能不负起一定的责任的。临时报告未能坦白的承认这一点，反而一方面为所谓不能使用武力问题多所辩护，另一方面又因朝中方面不能依照特务意志而修改其解释计划，即指责我方的解释计划为“行不通”，这是我们认为不能满意的。我们并已注意到捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员对于临时报告所作的声明。
    五、根据“职权范围”第一款，成立中立国遣返委员会的基本目标就是保证一切战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利。为了保证这种权利，“职权范围”又规定对一切战俘进行九十天的解释工作。而在九十天的解释工作进行之后，尚未行使其遣返权利的战俘则交由政治会议在三十天内加以处理。这些都是“职权范围”中强制性的关键措施，必须予以实现。现在，由于联合国军方面及其特务暴力组织的拖延破坏，并由于委员会未能完全履行其合法的职责，因此，解释工作只进行了九分之一的时间，百分之八十五的战俘尚未能听取解释，因而就没有机会来行使其被遣返的权利。同时，美国政府又有意地中断了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，使政治会议不得迅速召开来处理战俘问题。在这种情势之下，我们完全同意你在一九五三年十二月二十八日来信中所指出的，必须“以符合于‘职权范围’中所体现的基本目标的态度”对战俘问题“予以认真的考虑”。同时，我们并认为为了贯彻这种态度，就只有坚持委员会关于解释工作应予继续的主张，而这也是中立国遣返委员会所应予认真考虑的。
    六、根据上述，为了符合于“职权范围”的基本目标，我们坚持九十天的解释期限应予补足，尚未行使其被遣返权利的战俘问题应交由政治会议在召开后的三十天内加以处理。而在这些步骤实现以前，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队应继续履行其尚未完成的合法职务，这就是：立即恢复对战俘的解释工作，实行隔离战俘，打散特务暴力组织，清除一切特务分子，并在九十天的解释期限补足之后继续看管战俘，以待政治会议的处理。
    只有坚持中立国的公正立场，中立国遣返委员会才能得到全世界正义人类的衷心支持，亦才有可能使联合国军方面自其蛮横无理的立场退缩。我们希望中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队将能够不辜负这样的期待。
