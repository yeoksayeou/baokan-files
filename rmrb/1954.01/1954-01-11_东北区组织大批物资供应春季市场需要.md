The state-owned department store system in the Northeast region has organized a large amount of materials to prepare for the supply needs of the first quarter of this year.

The state-owned department store system in the Northeast region has ordered over 1.1 trillion yuan worth of industrial products from state-owned factories and local state-owned factories within the region, of which over 890 billion yuan worth of industrial products are to be supplied to meet the needs of urban and rural people in the Northeast region during the first quarter of this year.

Based on the production and sales situation within the Northeast region, the Northeast China Department Store Company system expanded its intra-regional orders. It not only placed orders with large state-owned and local state-owned factories, but also paid attention to local small-scale industries and inter-provincial and municipal adjustment orders. Orders for clothing, leather shoes, toys, and stationery alone reached more than 100 billion yuan. This order also took into account the development of people's needs. Due to the increase in food consumption, especially during the Spring Festival when there is a need to fully supply various prepared foods, the state-owned department store system in the Northeast region has ordered 1,570 tons of various candies, 2,000 tons of various biscuits, 15 tons of monosodium glutamate for flavoring, and a portion of canned goods from large food industries in the region. In addition, various localities are also organizing small-scale handicraft industries to process large quantities of candies and pastries to ensure the supply during the Spring Festival. The orders also took into account the connection between production, supply, and sales seasons. A large number of spring and autumn clothing, undershirts, vests, and other commodities will be produced in the first quarter, which will ensure that seasonal goods are placed in grassroots stores in a timely manner when the season arrives, avoiding the phenomenon of "out of stock at the beginning of the season and backlog at the end of the season." In the allocation of orders, consideration was given to the supply of industrial products to grain-producing areas. For certain commodities needed by rural areas, priority was given to supplying rural areas. (Li Jiyao)

    东北区组织大批物资供应春季市场需要
    东北区国营百货系统组织大量物资，准备今年第一季度的供应需要。
    东北区国营百货系统向区内国营工厂和地方国营工厂订购了价值一万一千多亿元的工业品，其中有八千九百多亿元的工业品，要在今年第一季度内供应东北区城乡人民需要的。
    根据东北区内的产销情况，东北区百货公司系统扩大了区内的订货。不仅对国营和地方国营的大型工厂订了货，而且也注意到对地方小型工业、省市间调剂性的订货，其中仅服装、皮鞋、玩具、文具等即达一百多亿元。这次订货也注意到了人民需要的发展。由于食品消费增长，特别是在春节时期要充分供应各种制成食品，所以东北区国营百货公司系统从区内大型食品工业订购了各种糖果一千五百七十吨、各种饼干两千吨，调味材料的味素十五吨，另外还有一部分罐头。除此之外，各地还在当地组织小手工业加工大批糖果、点心，以保证春节的供应。订货中也注意到了产、供、销季节的衔接。第一季度即将大量生产春、秋季服装、汗衫、背心等等的商品，这样就能够保证在季节到来时，适时地将时令货摆到基层商店里，避免“季初脱销、季末积压”的现象。在订货的分配上，照顾了对产粮地区的工业品供应。对某些农村需要的商品，做到尽先供应农村。（李继尧）
