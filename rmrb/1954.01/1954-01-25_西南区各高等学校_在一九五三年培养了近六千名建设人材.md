    Southwest China's Universities
    Cultivated Nearly 6,000 Construction Talents in 1953

In 1953, universities in the Southwest region provided the nation with over 5,990 graduates, of which 32.4 percent were talents for industrial construction. Currently, there are more than 14,600 students enrolled in universities throughout the region, who will continue to cultivate various construction talents for the nation.

These graduates are distributed in various construction posts throughout the country. Of the more than 290 graduates from Chongqing University in 1953, 70 percent were assigned to Northeast and North China to participate in China's key construction projects. Yin Daci, a graduate of the Sichuan Chemical Industry College, was assigned to work in a rubber factory. Because he repaired the drying cylinder equipment, the steaming time for reclaimed rubber was reduced by one-third. Yao Qitong, a graduate of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Yunnan University of Technology, was assigned to work in a workshop in Anshan Iron and Steel. He worked hard to study technology and improved welding tools, which improved production efficiency and was praised by his superiors.

In order to make higher education more effective in cultivating construction talents for the nation's socialist industrialization, in 1953, universities in the Southwest region, on the basis of the department and discipline adjustments made in 1952, also focused on adjusting the engineering colleges according to the nature and development needs of the departments. At present, there are four higher engineering colleges, two comprehensive universities, four normal colleges, two agricultural colleges and medical colleges each, one college of finance and economics and one college of political science and law each, and one specialized school each for Russian, Fine Arts, Music, and Physical Education. After the adjustment, the proportion of engineering colleges in all aspects has greatly increased, and the unreasonable phenomena such as the complex departments and unclear training objectives of the old-style universities have been changed. After the adjustment of departments, the universities have set up a number of majors in undergraduate and specialized fields respectively, and there are forty-eight kinds of majors in engineering alone. The characteristics of these majors lie in their combination with practice and planned high-level professional training on the basis of theory to meet the needs of the refined division of labor in industrial construction.

    西南区各高等学校
    在一九五三年培养了近六千名建设人材
    一九五三年，西南区各高等学校为国家输送了五千九百九十多名毕业生，其中工业建设人材占百分之三十二点四。现在全区高等学校共有在校学生一万四千六百多名，将继续为国家培养各种建设人材。
    这些毕业生，分布在全国各地各项建设岗位上。重庆大学一九五三年毕业的二百九十多名学生，百分之七十分配到东北和华北等地区，参加我国的重点建设事业。四川化学工业学院毕业生尹大赐，分配在某橡胶厂工作，由于他修理了烘缸设备，因而使再生胶烘蒸时间缩短了三分之一。云南大学工学院机械系毕业生姚启桐分配到鞍钢某车间工作，他努力钻研技术，改进了焊接工具，提高了生产效率，因而受到上级表扬。
    为了使高等学校教育更有效地为国家的社会主义工业化培养建设人材，一九五三年西南区各高等学校在一九五二年院系调整的基础上，根据系科性质和发展的需要，又着重对工科性的院校进行了调整。现在共有高等工科性院校四所，综合性大学二所，师范学院四所，农学院和医科性学院各二所，财经学院和政法学院各一所，俄文、美术、音乐、体育等专科学校各一所。经过调整以后，工科性院校在各方面的比重都大大增加，并且改变了旧型大学系科庞杂和培养目标不明确等不合理现象。各高等学校在院系调整后，分别在本科和专科中设置了若干专业，仅工科的专业就有四十八种。这些专业的特点，在于与实际结合，并有计划地在理论基础上进行高度的专业训练，以适应工业建设精细分工的需要。　　　　　　（新华社）
