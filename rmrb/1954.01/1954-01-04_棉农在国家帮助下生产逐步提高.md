Cotton production is gradually increasing

In recent years, China's cotton production has gradually increased. In 1952, the total national lint output exceeded the highest annual output before the Anti-Japanese War by 50 percent. Taking the total output of 1949 as 100, the development progress in recent years is: 1950 was 160, 1951 was 235, and 1952 was 291. This allows us to completely rely on our own production to meet the needs of the people and the textile industry. Due to the various policies adopted by the People's Government to support cotton farmers' production and the huge economic support provided to cotton-growing areas, farmers have actively organized to improve cotton planting techniques, resulting in a year-by-year increase in cotton yield per unit area. In 1949, the national average yield was only 21.4 jin of lint per mu, but in 1952 it increased to 31.4 jin, an increase of 46.7 percent in unit area yield in three years.

Huge economic support from the state to cotton-growing areas

Since 1950, the People's Government has successively promoted more than 310 million jin of improved cotton seeds in cotton-growing areas. By 1953, the planting area of ​​improved upland cotton had expanded 24 times compared with before liberation. Generally, improved cotton seeds can increase production by 10 to 20 percent compared to local seeds. According to a 1951 survey of 12 key counties in Hebei Province, improved cotton seeds yielded an average of 96 to 118 jin of seed cotton per mu, while local cotton seeds yielded only 84 jin of seed cotton per mu.

In recent years, the state has supplied a large number of commercial fertilizers to cotton-growing areas. In 1952, oil cake fertilizers and chemical fertilizers supplied by cooperatives to cotton-growing areas accounted for about one-quarter of the total national supply of commercial fertilizers. In 1953, the supply of cake fertilizers and chemical fertilizers to cotton-growing areas by cooperatives increased even more. It is estimated that more than half of the cotton fields in the country are using cake fertilizers and chemical fertilizers. In the Northeast cotton-growing area, due to its proximity to fertilizer factories and the habit of using chemical fertilizers, more than one-third of the cotton fields have used ammonium sulfate.

In four years, the People's Government has promoted more than 600,000 sprayers and dusters in cotton-growing areas. In 1952 alone, the state supplied cotton farmers with more than 79 million jin of pesticides for controlling cotton pests, promoted 380,000 sprayers, and the government invested 500 billion yuan in pesticides for controlling cotton pests. Cotton farmers in Sanyu District, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, learned from the lessons of reduced production due to insect pests in previous years. This spring, almost every household added sprayers and prepared DDT. Due to regular prevention and control, the leaf roller caterpillars and bridge-building caterpillars, which had always been serious pests in the area, did not spread into a disaster this year. The average yield of seed cotton per mu was 150 jin, an increase of 45 jin compared to last year. Due to the vigorous supply of pesticides and machinery for pest control in cotton-growing areas, and the launch of pest control campaigns, it is estimated that the national lint loss recovered in 1951 and 1952 was about 1 million dan.

In recent years, the People's Government has also promoted a large number of new-style walking plows and cultivators in cotton-growing areas. Shijiazhuang Prefecture in Hebei Province is a major cotton-producing area. From 1950 to the first half of 1953, more than 5,500 new-style walking plows were promoted. Wang Zhitang, a model worker in Qiu County, Hebei Province, planted cotton on land with the same conditions. The land plowed with a new-style walking plow yielded 45 jin more seed cotton per mu than the land plowed with an old-style plow.

In terms of water conservancy in cotton-growing areas, the state has used great efforts to open up new channels, dig wells, and lend waterwheels to increase the irrigated area of ​​cotton fields. At present, the irrigated area of ​​cotton fields nationwide has developed to more than 8 million mu, and the irrigated cotton fields in Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi have reached more than one-quarter of the cotton field area in the three provinces. The Yellow River Diversion to Wei River irrigation canal can currently irrigate 400,000 mu, about half of which is cotton fields. In Hebei Province, in the first half of 1951 alone, more than 45,000 waterwheels were lent out and more than 5,700 old waterwheels were repaired, most of which were in cotton-growing areas. Yanjia Village in Jiexian County and Nandali Village in Xiaxian County, Shanxi Province, are both high-yield cotton villages. In the spring and summer of 1951, it was relatively dry. The average yield of dryland cotton in Yanjia Village was 156 jin of seed cotton per mu, and the average yield of irrigated land was 433 jin of seed cotton per mu. In 1952, the average yield of dryland cotton in Nandali Village was 213 jin of seed cotton per mu, and the average yield of irrigated land was 459 jin of seed cotton per mu. A comparison of the Yellow River Diversion to Wei River irrigation area in 1952 showed that irrigated cotton fields yielded 50 to 60 jin more seed cotton per mu than non-irrigated cotton fields. It is estimated that the cotton fields that can be irrigated in the Yellow River Diversion to Wei River irrigation area alone can increase production by about 10 million jin of seed cotton.

The state supplies cotton-growing areas with large quantities of grain, cloth, coal, salt, kerosene, and other necessities every year. At the same time, in order to take care of the difficulties in production and life of cotton farmers, the state also provides a large number of agricultural loans to cotton-growing areas every year, and in conjunction with the cotton pre-purchase work, pays cotton farmers in advance for grain, fertilizer, cloth, coal, salt, etc., as a deposit for the state's pre-purchase of cotton. In 1952 alone, the total value of grain, fertilizer, cloth, coal, salt, and other goods paid to cotton farmers in advance in connection with cotton pre-purchase contracts reached more than 700 billion yuan. Cotton farmers who signed cotton pre-purchase contracts received advance payments of grain and fertilizer, which solved the difficulties in their lives and production. Many people said with satisfaction, "As soon as the cotton is planted, we can eat grain."

In addition, in recent years, the state has also greatly developed and enriched agricultural science research institutes and state-owned farms at all levels in cotton-growing areas, established technical guidance stations, conducted experimental research on cotton planting techniques and on-site guidance; and used various methods to summarize and exchange the cotton planting experiences of the masses, and promoted advanced Soviet cotton planting techniques. These improvements in cotton planting techniques have achieved great success in increasing the yield of cotton per unit area. For example, in the Jinghui Canal irrigated cotton area in Shaanxi Province, cotton production had declined year after year due to the lack of crop rotation, irrigation techniques, and attention to soil fertility. In 1952, the average yield was only 25 jin of lint per mu. In the winter of 1952, the central and local party and government leading organs organized an inspection team. Under the guidance of Soviet expert Comrade Antonov, the cotton planting techniques in the Jinghui Canal irrigated cotton area were inspected and studied. The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry conducted guidance on cotton planting techniques for cotton farmers based on the technical improvement opinions put forward by the inspection team, which greatly increased the yield of cotton per unit area. In 1953, the 380,000 mu of cotton fields in the entire irrigated area yielded an average of about 60 jin of lint per mu, an increase of 1.4 times compared with 1952. That is to say, the 200,000 people in the Jinghui Canal irrigated area increased their income by more than 13 million jin of lint in 1953 compared with 1952.

Due to the huge economic support provided by the state to cotton-growing areas, the leadership of farmers in organizing and improving cotton planting techniques, increased cotton production, increased the income of cotton farmers, and gradually enriched their lives. In the spring of 1951, every village in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, a cotton-producing area, built 20 to 30 new houses. Cotton farmers in cotton-growing areas began to change the phenomenon that they could not afford clothes while growing cotton. Xiwai Village in Cheng'an County, Hebei Province, is a cotton-producing area with 400 households. During the two months after the cotton harvest in 1950, it bought more than 100 bicycles. Yanjia Village in Jiexian County, Shanxi Province, is a cotton-producing village with 120 households. In 1949, only three households in the village had surplus grain, but in 1951, the number of households with surplus grain and capital increased to 83. This village has the habit of weaving homespun cloth, but still purchased more than 30 bolts of city cloth in 1951. A survey in 1952 showed that the village had more than 70 thermos bottles and 104 pairs of sneakers and rubber shoes; 90 percent of the children in the village were enrolled in schools, and 97 percent of the young and middle-aged people were enrolled in regular folk schools; there was also a small library with subscriptions to six newspapers and magazines, and hundreds of books of various kinds.

The great responsibility of cotton farmers to industrial construction

The state's ability to use huge economic power to support cotton farmers' production is inseparable from the recovery and development of our country's entire national economy. Without the gradual improvement of industry, transportation, and commerce, it would be impossible to supply cotton-growing areas with so many means of production and necessities of life.

In order to adapt to the continuous improvement of people's living standards and meet the people's needs for cotton textiles, the state has not only expanded and rebuilt many old cotton textile factories in the past four years, but also built many new cotton textile factories in the cotton-producing areas of Central South, Northwest, North China, and Northeast, which guarantees that the cotton produced by cotton farmers has a market. China's cotton yarn production in 1952 was double that of 1949, and cotton cloth production was equivalent to 287 percent of that in 1949. Although cotton production has developed rapidly, and cotton yarn and cotton cloth production has also increased rapidly, the current average annual consumption of cotton textiles per capita in our country is still about three times less than that of the Soviet people. If the average person in our country wears an additional zhang of cloth per year, we need to produce more than 50 million more bolts of cloth per year, which is more than 5.5 million dan of cotton per year. Therefore, in the future, in order to cooperate with the development of the textile industry and the ever-increasing needs of the people's lives, increasing cotton production is one of the important tasks for a long time to come. The main way to increase cotton production is to increase the yield of cotton per unit area. At present, the average yield of cotton per unit area in our country is only one-third of that of the Soviet Union. In 1952, the Soviet Union averaged 280 jin of seed cotton per mu, while our current average yield is less than 100 jin of seed cotton per mu. However, individual high yields in our country have reached more than 1,000 jin per mu, which shows that the yield of cotton in our country can still be greatly increased.

It can be seen that if cotton farmers in our country want to obtain such high yields as in the Soviet Union and live like the Soviet people, they must contribute their strength in the state's industrial construction and produce a large amount of raw materials for the textile industry for the country. The primary key to increasing cotton yield is to organize mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, prepare conditions for improving cultivation techniques and using machines to cultivate, and move towards large-scale socialist agricultural production. At the same time, cotton is an important cash crop, and most or all of the cotton produced by cotton farmers must be sold, so it is particularly important to increase cotton production in a planned way and organize cotton farmers to join mutual aid groups and cooperatives. In recent years, the output of agricultural production cooperatives in various cotton-growing areas has been higher than that of mutual aid groups, and the output of mutual aid groups has been higher than that of individual households, which fully proves the superiority of collective production. In the future, in terms of further improving cotton cultivation technology, farmers in cotton-growing areas should also focus on doing the following: accumulating more barnyard manure and compost, reasonably increasing fertilizer application, and overcoming the current phenomenon of insufficient fertilization in cotton-growing areas; vigorously preventing and controlling the occurrence and development of diseases and insect pests, and reducing the loss of cotton yield and quality due to diseases and insect pests; and with the help of the state, expanding the irrigated area of ​​cotton fields and improving irrigation technology; carrying out autumn plowing of cotton fields and gradually deepening the cultivated layer; achieving seedling protection and thinning, and appropriate close planting; implementing pruning, cultivation, etc., to accelerate the maturity of cotton and increase cotton production.

In short, if farmers in cotton-growing areas can increase cotton production and sell cotton in accordance with the state's plan, they will have fulfilled a great responsibility to the state's industrial construction.

    棉农在国家帮助下生产逐步提高
    杨树藩
      棉花生产逐步提高
    几年来我国棉花生产逐步提高。一九五二年全国皮棉总产量已经超过了抗日战争前最高年产量百分之五十。如以一九四九年的总产量为一○○，几年来的发展进度是：一九五○年为一六○，一九五一年为二三五，一九五二年为二九一。这样就使我们可以完全依靠自己的生产，来满足全国人民和纺织工业的需要。由于人民政府采用了各种扶助棉农生产的政策，对棉区进行了巨大的经济支援；农民积极组织起来，进行植棉技术的改进，使棉花的单位面积产量逐年提高。一九四九年全国平均每亩只产皮棉二十一点四斤，一九五二年就增加到三十一点四斤，三年间单位面积产量提高了百分之四十六点七。
    国家对棉区的巨大经济支援
    自一九五○年以来，人民政府先后在棉区推广了优良棉种三亿一千余万斤，到一九五三年全国良种细绒棉的种植面积，比解放前扩大了二十四倍。一般良种棉花可比当地籽种的棉花增产一成到二成。根据一九五一年河北省十二个重点县的调查：良种棉花每亩平均产籽棉九十六斤至一百十八斤，而当地籽种棉花每亩只产籽棉八十四斤。
    几年来国家对棉区供应了大批商品肥料。一九五二年由合作社供应棉区的油饼类肥料、化学肥料，占全国商品肥料供应总量的四分之一左右。一九五三年由合作社供应棉区的饼类肥料、化学肥料又增加了许多。估计全国施用饼类肥料和化学肥料的棉田，已达棉田面积的半数以上。东北棉区由于靠近肥料工厂，又有施用化学肥料的习惯，已有三分之一以上的棉田施用了硫酸铔。
    四年间人民政府在棉区推广的喷雾器和喷粉器，共有六十余万架。只一九五二年国家供应棉农防治棉花害虫的药剂即达七千九百余万斤，推广喷雾器三十八万架，政府用在防治棉虫药剂的投资达五千亿元。江苏省南通三余区的棉农，接受了历年因虫害减产的教训，今春几乎每家都添置了喷雾器，准备了滴滴涕，由于经常防治，使该地一向为害严重的卷叶虫造桥虫，今年没有蔓延成灾，平均每亩产籽棉一百五十斤，比去年增产籽棉四十五斤。由于大力供应棉区治虫药械，开展治虫运动，估计一九五一年和一九五二年全国挽回皮棉损失都约有一百万担左右。
    几年来，人民政府在棉区还推广了大批的新式步犁和中耕器。河北省石家庄专区是一个主要产棉区，自一九五○年起至一九五三年上半年止，共推广了新式步犁五千五百多架。河北省邱县劳动模范王治堂，在同样条件的土地上种棉花，用新式步犁耕的地比用旧式犁耕的地，每亩多收四十五斤籽棉。
    在棉区的水利事业上，国家用了极大力量开辟新渠道、打井、贷放水车，以增加棉田的灌溉面积。目前全国棉田灌溉面积已发展到八百余万亩，河北、山西、陕西的灌溉棉田，已达三省棉田面积的四分之一以上。引黄济卫灌溉渠，目前可灌溉的四十万亩面积中，有半数左右是棉田。河北省只一九五一年上半年就贷出水车四万五千多辆，修理旧水车五千七百多辆，其中大部分是在棉区。山西省解县阎家村、夏县南大里村，都是棉花丰产村。一九五一年春夏较旱，阎家村旱地棉花平均每亩产籽棉一百五十六斤，灌溉地平均每亩产籽棉四百三十三斤；一九五二年南大里村旱地棉花平均每亩产籽棉二百十三斤，灌溉地平均每亩产籽棉四百五十九斤。引黄济卫灌溉区一九五二年的比较，灌溉的比不灌溉的棉田，每亩多收籽棉五十斤到六十斤。推算一下，只引黄济卫灌溉区内可以灌溉的棉田，就能增产一千万斤左右的籽棉。
    国家每年大量供应棉区粮食、布匹、煤、盐、煤油和其他生活资料。同时，为了照顾棉农们在生产上和生活上的困难，国家每年在棉区还要放出大批的农业贷款，并且结合棉花预购工作，在春季就预先支付给棉农粮食、肥料、布匹、煤、盐等，做为国家向棉农预购棉花的定金。只一九五二年结合棉花预购合同，先支付给棉农的粮食、肥料、布匹、煤、盐等实物的总值，折款就达七千多亿元。订立棉花预购合同的棉农，得到预付的粮食和肥料后，解决了生活上和生产上的困难，许多人都满意地说：“刚种上棉花，就吃上了粮食。”
    另外，几年来国家在棉区还大量发展和充实了农业科学研究所和各级国营农场，成立了技术指导站，进行植棉技术的试验研究和实地指导工作；并运用各种办法总结交流群众的植棉经验，推广苏联先进的植棉技术。这些植棉技术改进工作，在提高棉花单位面积产量上，获得了很大成就。例如，陕西省泾惠渠灌溉棉区，由于过去不讲究轮作倒茬、不讲究灌溉技术、不注意培养地力，使棉花连年减产，一九五二年平均每亩只产皮棉二十五斤。一九五二年冬季，中央及地方党政领导机关组织了考察组，在苏联专家安东洛夫同志的指导下，对泾惠渠灌溉棉区的植棉技术，进行了考察研究。陕西省农林厅根据考察组提出的技术改进意见，对棉农进行植棉技术的指导，大大地提高了棉花单位面积产量。一九五三年全灌溉区三十八万亩棉田，平均每亩产皮棉六十斤左右，比一九五二年增产一点四倍。也就是说泾惠渠灌溉区内二十万人口，一九五三年比一九五二年增加了一千三百多万斤皮棉的收入。
    由于国家对棉区进行了巨大的经济支援，领导农民组织起来和进行了植棉技术改进工作，提高了棉花产量，使棉农的收入增加，生活逐渐富裕起来。一九五一年春季产棉区山东省高唐县的每一个村都盖了二十间到三十间新房，棉区农民开始改变了自己种棉而却穿不起衣服的现象。河北省成安县西魏村是一个有四百户的产棉区，一九五零年棉花收获后的两个月期间，就买了一百多辆自行车。山西省解县阎家村是一个一百二十户的产棉村，一九四九年全村有余粮的只有三户，一九五一年有余粮、余资的增加到八十三户；这个村有织土布的习惯，但一九五一年仍购买了三十多匹市布；一九五二年调查：全村有暖水瓶七十多个，球鞋、胶鞋一百零四双；全村入学的儿童达百分之九十，入常年民校的青壮年达百分之九十七；还有一个小型图书馆，订有六种报纸和杂志，有数百册各种书籍。
    棉农对工业建设的伟大责任
    国家能用巨大经济力量来支援棉农的生产，是和我们国家整个国民经济的恢复和发展分不开的，没有工业、运输业、商业的逐步改善，就不可能供应棉区这样多的生产资料和生活资料。
    国家为了适应人民生活水平的不断提高，满足人民对棉织品的需要，四年间除扩充和改建了许多旧的棉纺织工厂外，还在中南、西北、华北、东北的产棉地区建筑了许多新的棉纺织工厂，这就保证棉农生产的棉花有了销路。我国一九五二年棉纱的生产量比一九四九年提高了一倍，棉布生产量相当于一九四九年的百分之二百八十七。虽然棉花的生产得到了迅速的发展，棉纱棉布的生产量也增加的很快，但是目前我国平均每人每年棉织品的消费量和苏联人民比较，还相差三倍左右。如果我国平均每人每年多穿一丈布，则每年需要多生产五千多万匹布，也就是每年要多生产五百五十多万担棉花。因而，今后为了配合纺织工业的发展和人民生活不断增长的需要，增产棉花是长时期内的重要任务之一。增产棉花的办法，主要是提高棉花单位面积产量，目前我国全国平均的棉花单位面积产量，才有苏联的三分之一，苏联一九五二年平均每亩产籽棉二百八十斤，而我们现在平均每亩产量还不到籽棉一百斤。但是我国个别的高额产量，也有达到了每亩一千多斤的，这就说明了我国棉花的产量，还可能大大地提高。
    由此可见，我国的棉农们要获得像苏联那样高的产量，过像苏联人民那样的生活，就必须在国家进行工业建设的当中，贡献出自己的力量，为国家生产大量的纺织工业原料。提高棉花产量的首要关键，是在共产党和人民政府的领导下，组织互助组和农业生产合作社，为改进耕作技术及使用机器耕种准备条件，向着大规模的社会主义的农业生产方向迈进。同时，棉花是重要的商品作物，棉农生产的棉花，大部或全部要出售，所以有计划地增产棉花，组织棉农加入互助组和合作社，就更显得特别重要。几年来各地棉区农业生产合作社的产量比互助组高，互助组的产量比单干户高，就充分证明了集体生产的优越性。今后在进一步提高棉花栽培技术方面，棉区的农民还应着重做好以下几点：多积厩肥、堆肥，合理增施肥料，克服目前棉区施肥不足的现象；大力防治病虫害的发生和发展，减少因病虫为害对棉花产量和品质的损失；并在国家的帮助下，扩大棉田灌溉面积，改进灌溉技术；进行棉田秋耕，逐步加深耕层；做到保苗、匀苗，适当密植；实施整枝、中耕等，以提早棉花的成熟，增加棉花的产量。
    总之、棉区的农民如能按照国家的计划增产棉花，出售棉花，就是对国家工业建设尽了伟大的责任。
