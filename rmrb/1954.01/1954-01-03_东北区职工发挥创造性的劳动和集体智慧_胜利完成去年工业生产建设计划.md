Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 2nd: The industrial production and construction plan for Northeast China in 1953 has been successfully completed. This is of great significance in promoting the speed of the country's socialist industrialization. In 1953, under the great encouragement of the country's commencement of the first Five-Year Plan and the widespread and in-depth publicity of the general line, more than one million workers in Northeast China gave play to creative labor and collective wisdom, resulting in tremendous achievements in both capital construction and industrial production. According to incomplete statistics, the total construction area completed in the region in 1953 reached more than 7.5 million square meters; the capital construction investment plan was completed by about 97 percent, of which the state-owned industrial construction projects were completed by about 99 percent; the overall progress of the 76 projects of the 32 key construction units was 100 percent completed according to plan. The three major projects of Anshan's large-scale rolling mill, seamless steel pipe plant, and No. 7 blast furnace, the first iron and steel industrial base in China, have been completed and put into production one after another. From now on, China will be able to mass-produce large-scale steel, seamless steel pipes, and heavy steel rails, which could not be rolled in the past, to meet the needs of the country in building railways, conducting geological exploration, establishing thermal power plants, and constructing heavy-duty factory buildings. In the coal, electricity, and petroleum industries, which serve as the "pioneer industries" in industrial construction, the newly built, renovated, and restored seven and a half vertical shafts, twenty-one inclined shafts, two open-pit coal mines, four power plants, and a number of artificial petroleum plant projects have been either fully or partially handed over to production, such as the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine, Petroleum Plant No. 5, and certain giant hydraulic and thermal power generators; some are nearing completion and will be handed over to production successively in 1954, such as the five vertical shafts in the Hegang, Jixi, Benxi, Shuangya, and Xi'an coal mines, Petroleum Plant No. 2, and several hundred kilometers of ultra-high-voltage transmission lines. Construction projects in the machinery industry, building materials industry, textile industry, and light industry have also basically completed the construction plan, ensuring project quality, and some have been put into production. The Eighth Cement Plant, the Heping Machinery Sugar Factory, and others have successively completed restoration and construction projects, and have begun to produce large quantities of cement urgently needed for national economic construction and sugar needed by the people. The five factory building construction projects of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the projects of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant and the Harbin Electric Motor Plant have completed the annual plan ahead of schedule, and some are currently carrying out winter construction in full swing.

　　The industrial production plan in Northeast China in 1953 was also overfulfilled. According to preliminary calculations by the Statistics Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, the total output value of state-owned industry is expected to be 106.5 percent of the plan, and the local state-owned industry is expected to be 105.9 percent; state-owned and local state-owned industries have increased production and saved wealth worth more than 4.3 trillion yuan throughout the year. The profit plan turned over to the state by enterprises under the five ministries in Northeast China, namely the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of First Machine Building Industry, the Ministry of Textile Industry, and the Ministry of Light Industry, is expected to be more than 111 percent; production costs from January to September decreased by 2.17 percent compared with the original plan; among 58 major products, 50 such as electricity, raw coal, gasoline, pig iron, steel ingots, steel, electrolytic copper, electrolytic lead, electrolytic zinc, electric motors, rock drills, drilling machines, lathes, drilling machines, milling machines, paper, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, flax textiles, etc. have completed or overfulfilled the national output plan, and the quality has also been greatly improved, especially the quality of light industrial products has been greatly improved compared with the past. Among dozens of major products of Northeast local state-owned industries, most of them have completed or overfulfilled the output plan, among which the quality of knitted goods, enamel products, and daily necessities such as toothpaste and soap has been significantly improved. The successful completion of the industrial production and construction plan in Northeast China has ensured the steady growth of the proportion of socialist industrial components. In 1953, the output value of state-owned and local state-owned industries increased by about 29.9 percent compared with 1952.

　　In the past year, there have also been significant improvements in production technology in various enterprises. In addition to the Anshan Seamless Steel Pipe Plant, Large Rolling Mill, Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine, and Harbin Flax Factory, which were built with the help of the Soviet government and Soviet experts and are produced with automation, mechanization, and the latest technology, workers in old enterprises actively learn from advanced Soviet technology and improve equipment. They have produced many important products that could not be produced or have not been produced in the past, strongly supporting national economic construction and meeting the needs of people's lives. Among the more than 320 new products successfully trial-produced by the Northeast machinery industry in 1953, which originally had a weak foundation, most of them could not be manufactured at all in the past, such as the 110,000-volt, 13,500 kVA giant high-voltage transformer supporting the North China Electric Power Bureau, the 40,000-volt, 20,000 kVA large transformer supporting the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the complete set of giant crushers supplied to non-ferrous metal mines, the 1,000-meter drilling machine supplied for geological exploration, and various new machine tools used by the machinery industry itself for expanded reproduction. The textile industry sector has also successfully trial-produced or mass-produced many new products, such as 42-count yarn, poplin, gabardine, flannelette, melton, cotton-linen blended canvas, Cony Lenine plain cloth, and high-grade uniform cloth.

　　The victory on the industrial production and construction front in Northeast China in 1953 is huge, encouraging the people of the entire region and the entire country to forge ahead on the road of socialist industrialization. However, achieving this great victory was not easy. Under the direct leadership of the central competent ministries and relying on the specific guidance and assistance of the local CCP committees, various enterprises generally improved their management level in 1953, especially strengthening planned management or technical management. At the same time, under the leadership of the CCP committees at all levels, state-owned factories, mines, and basic construction departments further implemented the resolution of the May 1951 Urban Work Conference of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, strengthening the guaranteeing and supervisory role of the Party in enterprises. Therefore, the broad masses of workers overcame various difficulties and were able to maintain good order in various very complex and arduous production and construction tasks, proceeding in accordance with the production and construction operation plans, thereby strengthening the balance of plan completion, improving the quality of projects and products, and increasing labor productivity. Reduced waste. According to statistics from the five central industrial ministries' production factories and mines in Northeast China, although a large number of new workers were added in 1953, the average labor productivity still increased by 15.4 percent compared with 1952, that is, the average worker did work equivalent to one year and two months of 1952 in 1953.

　　However, many enterprises still have shortcomings to varying degrees, such as uneven production, unstable product quality, many accidents, and management work and political work not keeping up with the requirements of production and construction development. Conscientiously overcoming these shortcomings is of great significance in ensuring the completion of the first Five-Year Plan, especially the production and construction plan for 1954. The production and construction tasks in Northeast China in 1954 are more arduous than in 1953. In addition to higher requirements for the quantity, quality, and variety of production, there are more than 100 important projects in industrial capital construction, and the technology is complex and the quality requirements are strict. In order to ensure the completion of this glorious and arduous task, various enterprises are prepared to start from the existing foundation, according to the requirements of the central competent ministries and their own specific circumstances, from the aspects of business thinking, labor organization, management system, leadership methods, production and construction technology, etc., based on the Soviet socialist enterprise management experience, to further improve the management work of enterprises.

    东北区职工发挥创造性的劳动和集体智慧
    胜利完成去年工业生产建设计划
    【新华社沈阳二日电】东北区一九五三年的工业生产建设计划已胜利完成。这对促进国家的社会主义工业化的速度，有着极其重大的意义。一九五三年，在国家开始了第一个五年建设计划和普遍深入宣传总路线的巨大鼓舞下，东北区百万以上的职工发挥了创造性的劳动和集体智慧，使基本建设和工业生产都得到巨大成就。据不完全统计，全区一九五三年中竣工的各种建筑面积达七百五十多万平方公尺；基本建设投资计划完成百分之九十七左右，其中国营工业建设工程完成百分之九十九左右；三十二个重点建设单位的七十六项工程，综合进度百分之百地完成了计划。我国第一个钢铁工业基地——鞍山的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第七号炼铁炉三大工程已先后完工并开始生产。从此，我国过去不能轧制的大型钢材、无缝钢管和重钢轨等，今后将能大量供应国家修建铁路、进行地质钻探、建立火力发电厂和建筑重型厂房等需要了。在作为工业建设中“先行工业”的煤、电、石油工业方面，新建、改建和恢复的七对半竖井、二十一处斜井、两个露天煤矿、四个发电厂以及若干人造石油厂的工程，有的已全部或部分移交生产，如海州露天煤矿、石油五厂和某些巨型的水轮及火力发电机等；有的已接近竣工，并将在一九五四年中陆续移交生产，如鹤岗、鸡西、本溪、双鸭、西安煤矿的五对竖井、石油二厂、几百公里长的超高压送电线路等。在机械工业、建筑材料工业、纺织工业和轻工业等方面的建设工程，也都基本上完成了施工计划，保证了工程质量，有的并已投入了生产。第八水泥厂、和平机器制糖厂等，已先后完成恢复和建设工程，开始大量生产着国家经济建设急需的水泥和人民需要的糖，第一汽车制造厂的五个厂房建筑工程和哈尔滨量具刃具厂、哈尔滨电机厂等工程已提前完成全年计划，目前有的正在紧张地进行冬季施工。
    一九五三年东北区的工业生产计划也超额完成了。据东北行政委员会统计局的初步计算，国营工业生产总值计划可完成百分之一百零六点五，地方国营工业可完成百分之一百零五点九；国营和地方国营工业全年增产节约了价值四万三千多亿元的财富。中央重工业部、燃料工业部、第一机械工业部、纺织工业部、轻工业部五个部在东北所属企业的上缴利润计划，预计可完成百分之一百十一以上；一月到九月生产成本比原计划降低百分之二点一七；五十八种主要产品中，有电、原煤、汽油、生铁、钢锭、钢材、电铜、电铅、电锌、电动机、凿岩机、钻探机、车床、钻床、铣床、纸张、棉纱、棉布、亚麻纺织品等五十种完成或超额完成了国家产量计划，质量也有很大改进，特别是轻工业产品质量比过去有很大的改进。东北地方国营工业几十种主要产品中，绝大部分都完成或超额完成了产量计划，其中针织品、搪磁制品和牙膏、香皂等日用品的质量，都有显著的提高。东北区工业生产建设计划的胜利完成，保证了社会主义工业成份比重的稳步增长。一九五三年国营和地方国营工业的产值，比一九五二年增长了百分之二十九点九左右。
    在过去一年中，各企业在生产技术方面也有了较大的改进。除苏联政府和苏联专家帮助我国建设的鞍山无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂、阜新海州露天煤矿和哈尔滨亚麻厂等，是以自动化、机械化和最新的技术进行生产外，旧有企业的职工积极学习苏联先进技术，改进设备，已生产出很多过去不能生产或没有生产过的重要产品，有力地支援了国家经济建设，满足了人民生活的需要。原来基础薄弱的东北机械工业，一九五三年试制成功的三百二十多种新产品中，绝大部分是过去根本不能制造的，如支援华北电业局的十一万伏特、一万三千五百千伏安巨型高压变压器，支援鞍山钢铁公司的四万伏特、二万千伏安的大型变压器，供应有色金属矿山用的成套的巨型破碎机，供应地质勘探用的一千公尺钻探机，以及机械工业本身为扩大再生产用的各种新型工作母机等。纺织工业部门也试制成功或已大量生产了许多新产品，如四十二支纱、府绸、华达呢、绒布、麦尔登呢、棉麻交织帆布、珂尼林元色布、高级制服呢等。
      一九五三年，东北区工业生产建设战线上的胜利是巨大的，它鼓舞着全区和全国人民在社会主义工业化的道路上奋勇前进。但取得这一巨大胜利并非易事，在中央各主管部的直接领导下，依靠各地中共党委的具体指导和帮助，各个企业在一九五三年普遍提高了管理水平特别是加强了计划管理或技术管理。同时，在各级中共党委的领导下，国营厂矿企业和基本建设部门进一步贯彻了中共中央东北局一九五一年五月城市工作会议的决议，加强了党在企业中的保证和监督作用。因此，广大职工群众战胜了各种困难，在各种非常复杂艰巨的生产和建设工作中，能够保持良好的秩序，按照生产和施工的作业计划去进行，从而加强了完成计划的均衡性，改进了工程和产品质量，提高了劳动生产率，减少了浪费现象。据中央五个工业部在东北所属生产厂矿的统计，一九五三年虽增添了大批新工人，但平均劳动生产率仍比一九五二年提高了百分之十五点四，即平均每一个工人在一九五三年中做了相当于一九五二年一年零两个月的工作。
    但是，不少企业也还不同程度地存在着生产不均衡，产品质量不稳定，事故多，管理工作和政治工作赶不上生产建设发展的要求等缺点。认真克服这些缺点，对于保证完成第一个五年计划，首先是一九五四年的生产建设计划有着重大的作用。一九五四年东北生产建设任务比一九五三年更加艰钜，除生产的数量、质量、品种等要求提高外，工业基本建设的重要工程有一百多个，而且技术复杂，质量要求严格。为了保证完成这个光荣而艰巨的任务，各企业准备在已有的基础上，根据中央各主管部的要求和自己的具体情况，从经营思想、劳动组织、管理制度、领导方法、生产和施工技术等各个方面着手，以苏联社会主义企业管理经验为依据，进一步改进企业的管理工作。
