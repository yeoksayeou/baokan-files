    Days of Studying in the Soviet Union
    Unforgettable Five Years　Luo Zhentao
    I was sent to the Soviet Union for study by the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee after the liberation of Northeast China in 1948, and recently returned to China after graduating from the Moscow Institute of Finance and Economics.

    My five years of studying and living in the Soviet Union are unforgettable. I remember when I first arrived in the Soviet Union, I couldn't speak Russian or read Russian books. The Soviet comrades asked me to go to the university to study Russian first. The first teacher who taught us Chinese students Russian was a female teacher. Although she lacked teaching experience with foreigners, she resolutely expressed her determination to overcome difficulties and teach us Russian well when we first met. The school also hired an assistant teacher to specifically guide us in learning Russian; and arranged for us to live with Soviet students, which gave us the opportunity to practice speaking Russian every day. After a period of time, the school hired special teachers to tutor us in basic courses such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics.

    When we started studying "Das Kapital" at Moscow University, we encountered great difficulties. The school decided to let us concentrate on studying political economy and the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, and found a graduate student in political economy to help me study. This graduate student had fought in the Patriotic War and was gloriously wounded. He cared about me so much that he would find me after class to talk about political economy and "Das Kapital." He read and explained it very carefully and patiently. He explained it to me little by little. When he found me a little tired, he would take me out for a walk, or take me to play with Soviet students for a while; when I recovered my energy, he would start explaining it to me again and again. My Soviet classmates also helped me enthusiastically. Some lent me their notes, and some explained certain difficult problems to me. At the end of the first semester, I passed the exam victoriously. In the second semester, I transferred to the Credit Department of the Moscow Institute of Finance and Economics. Here, I encountered new difficulties, that is, the courses in the two schools were not exactly the same. If I wanted to attend classes with the rest, I had to make up for certain courses. At that time, I thought of starting from the first grade and learning from the beginning. Two Soviet female students who lived with me, after understanding my situation, talked to me, hoping that I would attend classes and expressed their willingness to do everything possible to tutor me. Encouraged and helped by them, I plunged into intense study again. These two Soviet students had both participated in the Patriotic War. They took care of me in every way in life and helped me cook every day, so that I had more time to study. The school also specially hired a graduate student to help me prepare for the exam. By the second year, my Russian was more proficient, my ability to study independently had improved, and I felt more relaxed in my studies.

    With the help of Soviet teachers and students, I made great progress in my studies, and my exam scores were all four or five points.

    I established deep feelings with Soviet students and students from other people's democratic countries. After class, we often watched movies or dramas together, participated in various parties, or exchanged learning experiences together.

    I lived in the Soviet Union for five years. In these short five years, the changes in Moscow were amazing. The face of the city was changing day by day, and the material and cultural life of the people was growing by leaps and bounds. Everything in the socialist country educated me and gave me more confidence in building our great motherland.

    I Miss My Supervisor at the Soviet Academy of Sciences
    Feng Kang
    I studied mathematics and was sent to the Mathematics Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in the summer of 1951. I returned to my country in December 1953 due to illness. My two years of studying in the Soviet Union left a deep impression on me.

    When I first arrived in the Soviet Union, I was like an "illiterate" because I couldn't speak Russian, couldn't read Russian books, and couldn't understand what Soviet comrades said. But with the enthusiastic help of Soviet comrades, after a short period of study, I and several other Chinese students basically mastered Russian. Then I encountered difficulties in professional studies. The Soviet Academy of Sciences required every graduate student to have broad knowledge and in-depth research in their major, but we lacked this condition, so we all needed to make up lessons to varying degrees. During this period, Soviet teachers and students gave us a lot of help, allowing us to quickly transition to regular study and research. The leaders of the institute were very concerned about and attached great importance to the studies of each of our graduate students, and invited many famous academicians of the Academy of Sciences, corresponding academicians, or authoritative experts and scholars to be our supervisors. For example, my supervisor, Professor Bondriagin, was an outstanding Soviet geometer and a corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Comrade Zhang Weizhen, who was studying at the Soviet Academy of Sciences, had Kostyakov as his supervisor, who was a farmland water conservancy expert who had won the Stalin Prize twice and a corresponding academician of the Academy of Sciences. The leaders also paid great attention to the direction of our graduate students' special research and the issue of combining it with China's actual conditions, and conducted research.

    The main purpose of general research institutes in the Soviet Union is to train young scientific research workers and teachers for universities, so the requirements are very high. Every graduate student must have a high level of political and professional skills; their knowledge of basic sciences must be solid, they must also be proficient in their major, and have the ability to conduct independent research. During the entire study process, the guidance of the supervisor occupies a very important position. My supervisor, Professor Bondriagin, was blind, and he was very concerned about my studies and specifically helped me develop a study plan. He often asked about my study progress and taught me tirelessly. Once he said to me: "Theoretical research must be linked to practice and improve oneself from practice. For example, those engaged in mathematical research should not forget the connection between mathematics and other sciences and technologies." Professor Bondriagin, while engaged in research, often paid attention to mathematical problems related to economic construction. He not only cared about my mathematical studies, but also cared about my Marxist-Leninist studies; he also cared about me in life.

    During the summer, the Soviet Academy of Sciences sent us to visit and intern in industrial and mining areas or communist construction project sites. For example, students studying water conservancy, under the leadership of Soviet experts, went to the Volga-Don Canal built by Lenin, which had just been completed, for a "study trip," or to the Turkmen Main Canal construction site and irrigation areas in Armenia for internships. After the internship, we were sent to rest in sanatoriums in the Black Sea, the Caucasus, and other places.

    When I returned to China, many graduate students had already started special research work and were writing theses. For example, Mei Zhentong, who was studying at the Pavlov Institute of Physiology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Xu Xurong, who was studying at the Physics Institute, and Tu Guangchi, who was studying geological science at Moscow University, had all passed the examinations for compulsory subjects for a master's degree and began to conduct thesis research and writing under the leadership of Soviet supervisors.

    在苏联学习的日子里
    难忘的五年　罗镇涛
    我是在一九四八年东北解放后，由中共中央东北局派赴苏联学习的，最近才从莫斯科财经学院毕业回国。
    在苏联的五年学习生活，我是难以忘怀的。记得我初到苏联的时候，既不会说俄语，也不会看俄文书，苏联同志就叫我先到大学里去学习俄文。第一个教我们中国同学学习俄文的是一位女教师，虽然她对外国人缺乏教学经验，但第一次见面她就坚决表示要克服困难，教我们学好俄文。学校方面又请了一位辅助教员，专门指导我们学俄文；并分配我们和苏联同学在一起住宿，这样就使我们每天都有练习讲俄语的机会。经过一个时期以后，学校方面又请了专门教师，给我们补习基础课程，如物理、化学、数学等。
    我们在莫斯科大学开始学习“资本论”时，感到很大困难。学校方面就决定先让我们集中精力学政治经济学和马克思列宁主义基础理论，并给我找了一位学政治经济学的研究生，帮助我学习。这位研究生曾在卫国战争中作过战，光荣地负过伤。他那样关心我，一下课，他就把我找去，给我讲政治经济学和“资本论”。他边念边讲，非常细致和耐心。他一小段一小段地讲给我听，发现我有些疲倦时，他便拉我出去散步，或把我带到苏联同学处玩一会；等我精神恢复了，又开始一遍一遍地给我讲解。我的同班苏联同学们也热情地帮助我，有的把自己的笔记借给我看，有的给我讲解某些疑难问题。第一学期结束时，我胜利地通过了考试。第二学期起，我转到莫斯科财经学院信贷系学习。这里，我又遇到了新的困难，那就是两个学校的课程不完全一样，如果我要跟班上课，一定要补习某些课程。当时，我想由一年级开始，再从头学起。和我住在一起的两位苏联女同学，了解我的情况后，就和我谈话，希望我跟班上课，并表示愿尽一切力量给我补习功课。在她们的鼓励和帮助下，我又投入了紧张的学习。这两位苏联同学，都参加过卫国战争，她们在生活上处处照顾我，每天帮我做饭，使我有更多的时间进行学习。学校方面还特别请了一位研究生，帮助我准备考试。到二年级时，我的俄文比较熟练了，自学能力提高，学习上感到轻松一些了。
    在苏联教师和同学的帮助下，我在学习上有了很大的进步，考试成绩都获得四分、五分。
    我和苏联同学以及其他人民民主国家的留学生建立了很深的感情，在课后经常和她们一起看电影或戏剧，参加各种晚会，或在一起交换学习经验。
    我在苏联生活了五年。在这短短的五年间，莫斯科的变化是惊人的，城市的面貌一天天的改变着，人民的物质、文化生活飞跃地增长着。社会主义国家的一切，教育了我，使我更增加了建设我们伟大祖国的信心。
    我怀念着苏联科学院的导师
    冯康
    我是学数学的，于一九五一年夏季派赴苏联科学院数学研究所学习。一九五三年十二月间我因病回到了祖国。在苏联的两年学习生活，给我留下了深刻的印象。
    刚到苏联时，我好像一个“文盲”，因为我不会说俄语，不能看俄文书，也听不懂苏联同志的话。但在苏联同志的热诚帮助下，经过短期的学习，我和其他几个中国同学一样，基本上掌握了俄文。接着在专业学习方面我又遇到了困难。苏联科学院要求每一个研究生都具有广博的知识，对专业要有较深的研究，而我们却缺乏这个条件，因此都需要在不同程度上进行补课。在这期间，苏联教师和同学给了我们很大的帮助，使我们很快转入正规的学习和研究。研究所领导方面对我们每一个研究生的学习非常关怀和重视，请许多著名的科学院院士、通讯院士或权威的专家、学者做我们的导师。例如我的导师邦德里亚金教授就是苏联杰出的几何学家、苏联科学院的通讯院士。在苏联科学院学习的张蔚榛同志的导师科斯佳柯夫，是获得两次斯大林奖金的农田水利专家、科学院的通讯院士。对我们每个研究生的专题研究的方向以及与中国实际结合的问题，领导方面也十分注意，曾进行了研究。
    苏联一般的研究院，主要目的在于培养年青的科学研究工作者和高等学校的师资，因此要求很高，每一个研究生必须具有高度的政治水平和业务水平；基础科学的知识要结实，还要精通专业，具有独立研究的能力。在整个学习过程中，导师的指导占有很重要的地位。我的导师邦德里亚金教授，双目失明，他非常关心我的学习，具体地帮助我制订学习计划。他经常了解我的学习情况，不倦地教导我。有一次他对我说：“理论研究工作，必须和实践联系起来，并从实践中提高自己。例如，从事数学研究的人，不要忘了数学和其他科学技术的联系。”邦德里亚金教授一面从事研究工作，一面经常注意研究和经济建设有关的数学问题。他不仅关心我的数学学习，而且关心我的马克思列宁主义学习；在生活上也很关心我。
    暑期中。苏联科学院送我们到工矿区或共产主义建设工程工地去参观、实习。例如，学习水利的同学，在苏联专家的领导下，到刚完工不久的列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河作“学习旅行”，或到土库曼大运河工地、亚美尼亚的灌溉区实习。实习结束后，又把我们送到黑海、高加索等地的疗养所休息。
    当我回国的时候，有许多研究生已开始了专题研究工作，从事论文的写作。例如在苏联科学院巴甫洛夫生理研究所学习的梅镇彤、在物理研究所学习的徐叙瑢、在莫斯科大学学地质科学的涂光炽等，都通过了硕士学位必修学科的考试，并开始在苏联导师的领导下进行论文的研究和写作。（附图片）
