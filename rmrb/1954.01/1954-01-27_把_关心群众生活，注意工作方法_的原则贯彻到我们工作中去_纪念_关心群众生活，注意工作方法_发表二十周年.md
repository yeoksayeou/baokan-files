　　Implement the Principle of "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods" in Our Work
　　——Commemorating the 20th Anniversary of the Publication of "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods"
    Chen Manyuan, Acting Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods," this important thesis is part of the conclusion made by Comrade Mao Zedong at the Second National Congress of Workers and Peasants Representatives twenty years ago. In this thesis, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us on important methods for mobilizing the broad masses of the people to carry out revolutionary war, defeat the enemy, and achieve revolutionary victory. At the beginning of the thesis, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Our central task now is to mobilize the broad masses to participate in the revolutionary war, overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang through revolutionary war, develop the revolution to the whole country, and drive imperialism out of China. ... If our comrades truly see this central task clearly, and understand that the revolution must be developed to the whole country no matter what, then we cannot neglect or belittle the immediate interests and well-being of the broad masses. Because revolutionary war is a war of the masses, only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." And he pointed out: "Organizing revolutionary war and improving the people's livelihood are our two major tasks. Here, the question of working methods is seriously placed before us."
    The revolutionary war we waged in the past was a people's war, the purpose of which was for the benefit of the people, for the liberation of the people, to enable the people to completely get rid of the rule and oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism (whose concentrated representative was the Kuomintang reactionaries), to move towards a better and happier life, and to create preconditions for our country to transition to a socialist society. However, it is not enough to only see the long-term benefits of this revolutionary war for the people; to truly make revolutionary war a people's war, it is necessary to combine revolutionary war with the immediate interests of the people, and it is necessary to carry out the work of mobilizing the masses. How to mobilize the masses? Comrade Mao Zedong clearly instructed us on an extremely important method: "Concern for the well-being of the masses, pay attention to working methods." The great victories achieved in the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Third Revolutionary Civil War, and the economic recovery and various social reform work carried out after the victory of the People's Democratic Revolution over the past twenty years have all proven the importance and correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction. Just think back, how could our People's Army, in the extremely difficult and arduous environment under the enemy's "blockade," "encirclement and suppression," and "mopping up," preserve its own strength, gradually grow and develop its own strength, and smash the "impregnable" "copper walls and iron walls" that the enemy called themselves? In addition to the fundamental reason that the revolutionary war we were waging was a just war under the leadership of the Communist Party and for the liberation of the masses, it was also because we always implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction of "concern for the well-being of the masses, pay attention to working methods," solved the problems of the masses, met the needs of the masses, and improved the political consciousness of the people and their determination and confidence in the struggle against the enemy, so that the masses truly surrounded us, warmly supported, assisted, and participated in the revolutionary war. The revolutionary cause is the cause of the people, and it must be promoted through correct and active working methods to make the masses consciously act to achieve victory. This is the truth proven by the history of the Chinese revolutionary war.
    The great victory of the People's Revolutionary War has opened up the road forward for our country's socialist construction. After three years of economic recovery and the completion of various social reforms, our country has now entered the construction stage of the first five-year plan. Socialist construction is also a cause of the people, and it is necessary to fully mobilize the people and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in order to achieve victory. Therefore, the principle of "concern for the well-being of the masses, pay attention to working methods" instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong must also be implemented in our current national construction work in order to mobilize millions of people and turn the national construction plan into the actions of the masses. Every step of progress in our country's construction is inseparable from the active actions of the masses. In summarizing the first five-year plan of the Soviet Union, Stalin pointed out that the reason for the great success of the first five-year plan was "first of all, the enthusiasm and selflessness, zeal and initiative shown by millions of workers and collective farmers, who, together with engineering and technical personnel, exerted great efforts to develop socialist competition and shock work. Without this, we would not have been able to achieve our goals, we would not have been able to move forward, and there is no doubt about that." ("Summary of the First Five-Year Plan") This assessment has extremely realistic significance for our planned economic construction that is underway. Economic construction is an extremely complex and arduous undertaking, and it is also a work that we are extremely lacking in experience. Only by fully mobilizing and relying on the masses and concentrating the wisdom of the masses in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions can we advance victoriously. This is something that every Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre must recognize.
    How should we implement Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and do a good job in the country's construction work?
    First of all, we must clearly recognize that all our work must be combined with the long-term and immediate interests of the people, and we must implement the idea of serving the people. Our revolutionary work and national construction work are for the benefit of the people, to enable the people to get rid of the suffering they suffered under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past, gradually move towards a socialist society, and jointly enjoy a happy life. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre must deeply understand this truth in order to recognize the importance of the work they are undertaking, and to do the work well with a responsible spirit and correct methods. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Another significant symbol that distinguishes us Communists from any other political party is that we maintain the closest contact with the broadest masses of the people. Serving the people wholeheartedly, never being divorced from the masses for a moment; proceeding from the interests of the people in everything, rather than from the interests of individuals or small groups; the consistency of being responsible to the people and being responsible to the leading organs of the Party; these are our starting points." "... All the words and actions of Communists must be in line with the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people, and be supported by the broadest masses of the people as the highest standard." ("On Coalition Government")
    There is no doubt that all our policies are formulated from the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people, and all our work is for the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people. At present, in our country's transition period, to gradually realize socialist industrialization, to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, is to make our country an independent, prosperous and strong socialist country, so that the broad masses of the people can jointly achieve a wealthy and happy life, and this is the greatest interest of the broad masses of the people. However, in carrying out socialist construction, we must also be good at enabling the people to recognize this greatest interest from their own personal experience, to recognize the great significance of this work, so as to actively support and participate in this great construction cause. When the masses have not yet realized that socialist construction is the greatest interest of all the people, the infinite potential power hidden in the masses cannot be fully utilized; and if the power of the masses is not utilized, and the wisdom and creation of the masses are not utilized, our country's construction cause cannot achieve victory. Therefore, every Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre must clearly recognize that all our work is for the highest interests of the people, and at the same time, with the spirit of serving the people, be good at mobilizing and educating the masses from their own personal experience, so that they can recognize the relationship between our various construction work and the highest interests of the masses.
    Secondly, we must clearly recognize that all our work can only be done effectively by fully mobilizing and relying on the masses. In the past revolutionary war period, the reason why we were able to defeat the enemy who was many times stronger than us at the beginning, and were able to defeat the enemy's attacks countless times and achieve the final victory of the revolutionary war, was the result of the heroic and skillful fighting of the People's Army, the warm support and assistance of the broad masses of the people, and the correct leadership of the Communist Party, that is, the result of fully mobilizing and relying on the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "What is the real copper wall and iron wall? It is the masses, it is the millions of masses who sincerely support the revolution. This is the real copper wall and iron wall, which no force can break, and it cannot be broken at all. The counter-revolution cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolution. Unite millions of people around the revolutionary government, develop our revolutionary war, and we will eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, and we will seize the whole of China."
    Similarly, we carried out a series of mass movements during the transition period, eliminated the remaining enemies, restored and developed the economy, and started planned economic construction, and completed the first year's task of the first five-year plan. All these great achievements were also achieved on the basis of fully mobilizing and relying on the masses. In the future, the task of socialist construction will be more arduous. The series of work that must be carried out in construction, such as increasing production, practicing economy, accumulating funds, improving technology, and improving labor productivity, can only be done well on the basis of the conscious and active actions of the masses. Therefore, in the period of national planned economic construction, it is necessary to mobilize the masses more meticulously and arduously; any simple and hasty approach will not be able to fully mobilize the masses and give full play to the wisdom and strength of the masses.
    Although some of our comrades have great enthusiasm in their work, they lack the viewpoint of mobilizing and relying on the masses, and attempt to replace the conscious actions of the masses with their own personal strength and administrative orders, or only care about completing their own tasks, and do not care about the lives of the masses and the urgent problems that need to be solved. Therefore, they cannot or cannot fully mobilize the masses, thus making the tasks unable to be completed as scheduled, and even causing failures. This kind of lesson is not uncommon.
    Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us in "On Coalition Government": "Educate every comrade to love the people, listen carefully to the voices of the masses; whenever you go to a place, mingle with the masses there, do not stand high above the masses, but go deep into the masses; according to the level of consciousness of the masses, enlighten and raise the consciousness of the masses, and help the masses to gradually organize themselves under the principle that the masses are willing from the bottom of their hearts, and gradually develop all the necessary struggles permitted by the internal and external environment at that time and in that place." We must follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions to fully mobilize and rely on the masses to promote our country's construction cause.
    Finally, we must oppose the subjective and commandist work style, and carry forward the realistic and close contact with the masses work style. All subjective and commandist work styles are manifestations of the lack of mass viewpoint and the viewpoint of not proceeding from reality. This kind of erroneous viewpoint has been criticized by Comrade Mao Zedong many times. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party": "Subjectivism exists strongly in some party members, which is very unfavorable to analyzing the political situation and guiding the work. Because the inevitable result of the subjective analysis of the political situation and the subjective guidance of the work is either opportunism or blind actionism." In "On Coalition Government," he pointed out again: "In all work, commandism is wrong, because it exceeds the level of consciousness of the masses, violates the principle of the voluntary participation of the masses, and suffers from acute illness. Our comrades must not think that what they understand, the broad masses also understand the same. Whether the masses have already understood and whether they are willing to take action, one must go to the masses to investigate before one knows. If we do this, we can avoid commandism."
    In implementing all the work of the general line of the country in the transition period, working methods should become a matter of serious attention for us. For example, in the increase production and practice economy movement carried out in factories, it is necessary to vigorously implement planned management, tap potential, find tricks, put forward rationalization proposals, and promote advanced experiences in the movement, etc., which can only be carried out on the basis of mobilizing the workers. It is absolutely impossible to launch this mass movement by relying on commands. For another example, in carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas, it is also necessary to adopt a realistic approach, based on the level of consciousness of the masses, adhere to the principle of voluntariness, and use persuasive education methods to gradually organize the masses, increase production, increase income, and gradually embark on the socialist road. Here, any subjective and commandist practices will inevitably seriously damage the cause of transforming the small peasant economy. Even many things that are beneficial to the masses at the moment, such as the guidance of agricultural technology and the promotion of advanced farming methods, if they do not proceed from the actual situation of the local area, do not start from patient education and typical demonstrations to improve the peasants' awareness and gain the trust and support of the peasants, but rigidly copy the experience and methods in books or other places, the result will inevitably be opposed by the masses and will not work; or if they are implemented by compulsory command, the masses will also suffer losses, and good things will turn into bad things.
    In summary, proceeding from the interests of the masses, implementing the idea of serving the people; implementing the viewpoint of fully mobilizing and relying on the masses to do a good job; opposing the subjective and commandist work style, and carrying forward the realistic and close contact with the masses work style, this is the viewpoint that we must clearly recognize in learning Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis to do a good job in our socialist construction.

　　把“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”的原则贯彻到我们工作中去
　　——纪念“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”发表二十周年
    中共广西省委代理书记　陈漫远
    “关心群众生活，注意工作方法”这篇重要的论文，是毛泽东同志二十年前在第二次全国工农代表大会上所作的结论的一部分。在这篇论文中，毛泽东同志给我们指示了如何发动广大的人民群众，进行革命战争，来战胜敌人，取得革命的胜利的重要方法。毛泽东同志在论文中，一开始就指出：“我们现在的中心任务是动员广大群众参加革命战争，以革命战争打倒帝国主义和国民党，把革命发展到全国去，把帝国主义赶出中国去。……我们的同志如果把这个中心任务真正看清楚了，懂得无论如何要把革命发展到全国去，那末，我们对于广大群众的切身利益问题，群众的生活问题，就一点也不能疏忽，一点也不能看轻。因为革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”并指出：“组织革命战争，改良群众生活，这是我们的两大任务。在这里，工作方法的问题，就严重地摆在我们的面前。”
    我们过去所进行的革命战争，是人民战争，其目的是为了人民的利益，为了人民的解放，为了使人民彻底摆脱帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义（其集中的代表就是国民党反动派）的统治和压迫，走向美好的、幸福的生活，为我们国家过渡到社会主义社会创造前提条件。但是，仅仅看到这个革命战争对人民群众的远大利益还是不够的，要使革命战争真正成为人民战争，就必须把革命战争和人民群众的切身利益结合起来，就必须进行发动群众的工作。怎样去发动群众呢？毛泽东同志明确地给我们指示了一个极其重要的方法：“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”。二十年来所经历的第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争、第三次国内革命战争，以至人民民主革命胜利后所进行的经济恢复和各项社会改革工作，所取得的伟大胜利，都证明了毛泽东同志的这个指示的重要性和正确性。只要回想一下，过去我们的人民军队，在敌人的“封锁”、“围剿”、“扫荡”下的极端艰苦困难环境中，能够保存自己的力量，逐步壮大发展自己的力量，把敌人自称为“牢不可破”的“铜墙铁壁”打得粉碎，这是由于什么原因呢？除了由于我们所进行的革命战争乃是在共产党领导下的、为了人民群众的解放的正义战争这个根本的原因以外，同时更由于我们始终执行着毛泽东同志这个“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”的指示，解决了群众的问题，满足了群众的需要，并提高了人民群众的政治觉悟与对敌斗争的决心和信心，使群众真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护、支援和参加革命战争的缘故。革命事业是人民的事业，必须通过正确的积极的工作方法，促使群众自觉地行动起来，才会取得胜利，这就是中国革命战争的历史所证明了的真理。
    人民革命战争的伟大胜利，为我国的社会主义建设事业开辟了前进的道路。经过三年来的经济恢复和各项社会改革的完成，现在我们国家已进入了第一个五年计划的建设阶段。社会主义建设事业同样是人民的事业，必须充分动员人民群众，发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，才能取得胜利。因此，毛泽东同志所指示的“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”的原则，同样必须贯彻到我们当前国家各项建设工作中去，才能把千百万人民群众动员起来，把国家的建设计划变成群众的行动。我们国家建设事业的每一步进展，都是和群众的积极行动分不开的。斯大林在总结苏联第一个五年计划时，曾指出第一个五年计划取得伟大成功的原因，“首先就是千百万工人和集体农民所表现的积极性和舍己精神，热忱和首倡性，他们和工程技师人员一起施展巨大力量来发展了社会主义竞赛和突击运动。没有这个情况，我们就会不能达到目的，就会不能前进一步，这是无可怀疑的。”（“第一个五年计划底总结”）这个估计对于我们正在开展的有计划的经济建设是有着极现实的意义的。经济建设是极其复杂艰巨的事业，也是我们极其缺乏经验的工作，只有按照毛泽东同志的指示，充分发动与依靠群众、集中群众的智慧，才能胜利前进。这是每一个共产党员和革命干部都必须认识的。
    我们应该怎样贯彻毛泽东同志的指示，把国家的建设工作做好呢？
    首先，必须明确认识：我们一切工作都必须与人民群众的长远利益和目前利益结合起来，都必须贯彻为人民服务的思想。我们的革命工作和国家建设工作，就是为人民谋幸福的，就是要使人民从过去在国民党反动统治下所遭受的痛苦中解脱出来，逐步地走到社会主义社会，共同享受幸福的生活。每一个共产党员和革命干部都必须深刻领会这个道理，才能认识自己所担负的工作的重要性，才能以负责的精神与正确的方法把工作做好。毛泽东同志教导说：“我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一个显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；向人民负责和向党的领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。”“……共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”（“论联合政府”）
    我们的一切政策都是从最广大人民群众的最大利益出发来制定，我们的一切工作都是为了最广大人民群众的最大利益，这是无可怀疑的。目前我们国家在过渡时期中，要逐步实现社会主义工业化，要逐步实现对农业、对手工业、对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，就是为了使我国成为独立富强的社会主义国家，使广大人民共同达到富裕幸福的生活，这就是广大人民群众的最大利益。但我们在进行社会主义建设事业中，还必须善于使人民群众从自己切身经验中认识这个最大利益，认识这个工作的重大意义，从而积极拥护和参加这个伟大的建设事业。当群众还没有认识社会主义建设事业是全体人民的最大利益的时候，群众当中所蕴藏着的无穷无尽的潜在力量，是不可能充分发挥出来的；而群众的力量没有发挥出来，群众的智慧和创造没有发挥出来，我们的国家建设事业也是不可能取得胜利的。所以每一个共产党员和革命干部必须明确认识我们一切工作都是为了人民群众的最高利益，同时又是以为人民服务的精神，善于从群众的切身经验出发来发动群众和教育群众，使他们认识我们各项建设工作与群众最高利益的关系。
    其次，必须明确认识：我们一切工作都只有充分发动群众和依靠群众，才能切实做好。我们在过去革命战争时期，所以能够战胜开始比我们强大多少倍的敌人，能够无数次地打败敌人的进攻，取得革命战争的最后胜利，就是依靠人民军队的英勇善战，广大人民群众的热烈拥护和支援，以及共产党的正确领导的结果，也就是充分发动群众与依靠群众的结果。毛泽东同志说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。在革命政府的周围团结起千百万群众来，发展我们的革命战争，我们就能消灭一切反革命，我们就能夺取全中国。”
    同样地，我们在过渡时期进行了一系列的群众运动，肃清了残余敌人，恢复和发展了经济，并开始了有计划的经济建设，完成了第一个五年计划第一年的任务，所有这一切伟大的成绩，也都是在充分发动群众和依靠群众的基础上取得的。今后社会主义建设事业的任务更艰巨，在建设中所必须进行的增加生产、厉行节约、积累资金、提高技术、提高劳动生产率等等一系列的工作，都必须在群众自觉的积极的行动基础上才能做好。因此，在国家计划经济建设时期，就必须更为细致、更为艰苦地来发动群众；任何简单急躁的做法，都是不可能把群众充分动员起来，把群众的智慧和力量充分发挥出来的。
    我们有些同志在工作中虽然有着很高的热情，但因为缺乏发动群众和依靠群众的观点，企图以自己的个人力量和行政命令去代替群众的自觉行动，或者只顾完成自己的任务，不关心群众的生活及其迫切需要解决的问题，所以就不能或不能充分发动群众，从而使任务不能如期完成，甚至造成失败的结果，这种教训是屡见不鲜的。
    因此，毛泽东同志在“论联合政府”中指示我们：“教育每一个同志热爱人民群众，细心地倾听群众的呼声；每到一地，就和那里的群众打成一片，不是高踞于群众之上，而是深入于群众之中；根据群众的觉悟程度，去启发和提高群众的觉悟，在群众出于内心自愿的原则之下，帮助群众逐步地组织起来，逐步地展开为当时当地内外环境所许可的一切必要的斗争。”我们必须按照毛泽东同志这个指示，去充分发动群众和依靠群众，推进我们国家的建设事业。
    最后，必须反对主观主义和命令主义的工作作风，发扬实事求是和密切联系群众的工作作风。一切主观主义与命令主义的作风都是缺乏群众观点和不从实际出发的观点的表现。这种错误的观点曾受到毛泽东同志的多次批判。毛泽东同志在“关于纠正党内的错误思想”中指出：“主观主义，在某些党员中浓厚地存在，这对分析政治形势和指导工作，都非常不利。因为对于政治形势的主观主义的分析和对于工作的主观主义的指导，其必然的结果，不是机会主义，就是盲动主义。”在“论联合政府”中又指出：“在一切工作中，命令主义是错误的，因为它超过群众的觉悟程度，违反了群众的自愿原则，害了急性病。我们的同志不要以为自己了解了的东西，广大群众也和自己一样都了解了。群众是否已经了解并且是否愿意行动起来，要到群众中去考察才会知道。如果我们这样做，就可以避免命令主义。”
    在贯彻国家在过渡时期总路线的一切工作中，工作方法应成为我们所严重注意的问题。譬如在工厂中所开展的增产节约运动，在运动中要大力贯彻计划管理、挖潜力、找窍门、提合理化建议和推广先进经验等等，都是依靠工人群众的发动，在其自觉基础上才能开展起来的；依靠命令是绝不能掀起这个群众性的运动来的。又如在农村开展互助合作运动，也只有采取实事求是，根据群众觉悟程度，坚持自愿原则，用说服教育的方法，才能把群众逐步地组织起来，增加生产，增加收入，逐步走上社会主义的道路。在这里，任何主观主义和命令主义的作法，都必然会严重损害这个改造小农经济的事业。即使许多对群众眼前有利的事情，如农业技术的指导和先进耕作方法的推广，如果不从当地的实际情况出发，不从耐心教育、典型示范来提高农民觉悟和取得农民的信任和拥护出发，而硬性照搬书本上的或别地的经验和办法，结果也必然会遭到群众反对而行不通；或者用强迫命令的办法实行起来，也会使群众遭受损失，把好事变成坏事的。
    总起来说，从群众利益出发，贯彻为人民服务的思想；贯彻充分发动群众和依靠群众来做好工作的观点；反对主观主义和命令主义的工作作风，发扬实事求是和密切联系群众的工作作风，这就是我们学习毛泽东同志这篇论文，来做好我们的社会主义建设事业所必须明确认识的观点。
