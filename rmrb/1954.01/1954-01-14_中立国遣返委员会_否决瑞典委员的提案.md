    Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission
    Rejects Swedish Member's Proposal
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 13] According to a communique issued by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission voted down a proposal put forward by the Swedish member on the 12th. This proposal stipulated that on January 22nd, the "prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation should be released from prisoner of war status and given civilian status."

    The proposal put forward by the Swedish member advocated: changing the status of the prisoners of war on January 22, "if the political conference mentioned in Paragraph 11 of the Terms of Reference fails to reach an agreement on other handling methods before this day, whether because the political conference has not been held before this day, or because the political conference has been held but has not reached any agreement on any other handling methods before this day." The Swedish member's proposal is clearly in violation of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." Paragraph 11 of the "Terms of Reference" clearly stipulates: "The issue of the disposal of prisoners of war who have not exercised the right to be repatriated shall be submitted to the political conference proposed in Paragraph 60 of the draft armistice agreement." Moreover, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also stated in its memorandum to both parties that submitting the issue of prisoner of war disposal to the political conference is "mandatory." The memorandum also stated that extending the explanatory period is "legal and necessary."

    People here point out that if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission maintains its impartial stance and does not succumb to U.S. threats, it should continue to guard the prisoners of war, demand the completion of the explanatory period, and demand that the political conference resolve the prisoner of war disposal issue in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference."

### 中立国遣返委员会  否决瑞典委员的提案

    中立国遣返委员会
    否决瑞典委员的提案
    【新华社开城十三日电】据中立国遣返委员会发表的公报说，中立国遣返委员会十二日以多数票否决了瑞典委员所提出的一项提案，这项提案规定在一月二十二日宣布“把未行使遣返权利的战俘解除战俘的身分使之具有平民的身分”。
    瑞典委员提出的这项提案主张：在一月二十二日改变战俘的身分，“如果在这一天之前职权范围第十一款所提到的政治会议未能就其他处理办法取得协议的话，不论是因为政治会议在这一天之前未曾举行，或者是因为政治会议虽已举行但未在这一天以前就其他任何处理办法取得协议”。瑞典委员的这个提案显然是违反“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的。“职权范围”第十一款明白规定：“未行使被遣返的权利之战俘的处理问题应交由停战协定草案第六十款中所建议召开的政治会议”。而且，中立国遣返委员会在给双方的备忘录中也说，将战俘处理问题提交政治会议，这是有“强制性的”。备忘录还说，延长解释期限是“合法和必要的”。
    此间人士指出，如果中立国遣返委员会维护它的公正立场，不为美方的威胁所屈，它就应当继续看管战俘，要求补足解释期限，并要求按照“职权范围”的规定由政治会议解决战俘处理问题。
