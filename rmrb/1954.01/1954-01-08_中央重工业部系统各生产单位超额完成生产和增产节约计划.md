    [This newspaper reports] The production system of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry has comprehensively exceeded the 1953 state plan. According to the actual figures of plan completion from January to November 1953 and the estimated figures for December of the units under the Ministry, the total production value can be completed at 108.5% of the state plan, an increase of more than 31% compared with 1952; the output of products generally increased by 10% to 50% compared with 1952; labor productivity increased by 1% compared with the plan, and 14% compared with 1952. In addition, the cost and profit delivery plans have also been exceeded. Among the 22 major products of the Ministry, 20 products, including iron ore, pig iron, steel, rolled steel, metallurgical coke, tungsten concentrate, molybdenum concentrate, copper, lead, zinc, tin, antimony, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, caustic soda, soda ash, ammonium nitrate, toluene, cement, and glass have all exceeded the state plan. Among them, ten products, including iron ore, exceeded the plan by more than 5%.
    In the first year of the national Five-Year Plan, the staff and workers of the production system of the Ministry of Heavy Industry not only successfully completed the state plan, but also exceeded the production increase and conservation plan by 3.3%, accumulating huge construction funds for the country. If the money saved from increased production and conservation is used to build factories, nine blast furnaces with a volume of 1,000 cubic meters can be built, and 3.15 million tons of pig iron can be produced annually; if used to build school buildings, 50 secondary technical schools can be established, accommodating a total of 75,000 students.
   [Another dispatch] In order to meet the new production tasks of 1954, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry successively held meetings of various administrative bureaus and division chiefs in mid-November and early December last year to check and study the production preparation work and existing problems of various systems. After the meeting, responsible cadres of units such as the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau and the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau also checked the production preparation of their enterprises. Since the New Year, according to reports from various units, the production situation is generally normal. Various units are combining the publicity of the general line with the education of employees on labor discipline, strengthening safety production, fire prevention, and frost prevention measures, and striving for normal production according to plan before and after the Spring Festival.
