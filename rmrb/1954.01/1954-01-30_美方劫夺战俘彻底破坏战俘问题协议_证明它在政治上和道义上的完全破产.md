　　The US side's Seizure of Prisoners of War Completely Destroys the Agreement on the Prisoner of War Issue
　　Proving its Complete Political and Moral Bankruptcy
    Disregarding international credibility, the American aggressors brazenly used armed forces and special agent organizations in the Dongchang-ri POW camp on January 20th and 21st to forcibly transport over 21,900 Korean and Chinese POWs who had not received explanations to Pohang and Gunsan in South Korea, and Keelung in Taiwan. According to their pre-determined steps, they forced these POWs to join the armies of the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan. This organized and criminal action of forcibly detaining POWs by the US side is another serious provocative act following their condoning of the Syngman Rhee clique's seizure of over 27,000 of our captured personnel in June last year. It not only completely destroys the agreement on the POW issue between the two sides of the armistice and seriously violates the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, but also makes the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue more complicated and difficult.
    On January 29th, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a statement, lodging the strongest protest against the US side's criminal behavior of arbitrarily violating international conventions and agreements. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out: "Now, anyone can see that the US side arbitrarily violates international conventions and agreements, fundamentally obliterates justice, righteousness, and humanitarian principles, and wantonly tramples on human dignity and freedom. The entire process of the so-called psychological warfare conducted by the US side on the POW issue proves its complete political and moral bankruptcy. If this criminal policy of the US side is not severely condemned and resolutely stopped, then the special agent terror that the US side is implementing against Korean and Chinese POWs today may be used against the people of any country in the world tomorrow." Therefore, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai called on the people of the world who love peace, freedom, and justice to take resolute action to stop the barbaric and brutal special agent terror policy of the American imperialists and to fight for the protection of human freedom, justice, and righteousness.
    The US side's forced detention of Korean and Chinese POWs is an attempt to use the POWs as a tool for "cold war" to conceal the unjust nature of its war of aggression against Korea and its shameful military and political failures. It is well known that the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea in an attempt to annex the entire Korean peninsula and then invade Northeast China. However, this arrogant plan of aggression by American imperialism was completely bankrupted under the heavy blows of the Korean and Chinese people and the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Therefore, they had no choice but to accept the proposal of Mr. Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations at the time, in June 1951, to begin armistice negotiations with the Korean and Chinese side. This great victory of the Korean and Chinese people greatly encouraged the courage and confidence of the peace-loving people of the Far East and the world to strive for lasting peace and oppose American imperialist aggression. This was obviously extremely unfavorable to the US government's continued pursuit of its aggressive policies. Therefore, before the armistice negotiations even began, the US side had decided to forcibly detain the Korean and Chinese POWs, attempting to use them to create bizarre lies and carry out deceptive propaganda to the world in order to cover up their military failure. To this end, the US side has been clamoring that Korean and Chinese POWs "do not want to be repatriated" home to live peaceful lives, but "voluntarily" remain in the so-called "free world" of South Korea and Taiwan under American enslavement to serve as cannon fodder!
    In order to realize this despicable attempt, the American aggressors, on the one hand, used armed forces to carry out barbaric massacres of our captured personnel; on the other hand, they dispatched a large number of special agents from the Syngman Rhee clique and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang into the POW camps to implement terrorist rule, coercing POWs to tattoo, write blood letters, and conduct bloody "screenings" to create the lie that POWs were unwilling to be repatriated. These facts of bloody terror by the US side were long ago confirmed by American generals Dodd and Colson. After the armistice was achieved, the US side allowed these Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents to follow the non-directly repatriated POWs into the Dongchang-ri POW camp. Under the direct instigation and coordination of the US side, these special agents carried out inhumane murders and other terrorist means, using violence to control and murder POWs, sabotaging the progress of explanatory work, obstructing POWs from applying for repatriation, and refusing isolation to listen to explanations; the US side also influenced Swiss and Swedish members to create various difficulties within the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, causing the Korean and Chinese side's explanatory work to only last for ten days, and the vast majority of POWs were fundamentally deprived of the right to listen to explanations and exercise their right to repatriation. The "Interim Report" submitted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to both sides on December 28, 1953, irrefutably confirmed the US side's responsibility for seriously sabotaging the implementation of the armistice agreement regarding explanatory work and the POW repatriation agreement.
    However, despite the strict control of the POWs by the US side's special agent organizations, more than 500 POWs still resolutely demanded to return to the Korean and Chinese side during the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. And when the US side transported the POWs on January 20th and 21st, although there was strict control by US special agent organizations and direct US military threats, about 90 POWs risked their lives to rush out and demand repatriation. These facts fully prove that our captured personnel are determined to demand repatriation. If the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "detailed rules for explanatory and visiting work" could be implemented, allowing POWs to break free from the control of US special agents and giving them full opportunities to listen to explanations and dispel their doubts, then all the genuine Korean and Chinese captured personnel, except for those special agents sent by the Syngman Rhee clique and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, could return to the Korean and Chinese side. The countless facts of POWs risking their lives to demand repatriation completely exposed the US side's shameless lie that POWs "would rather die than be repatriated." These facts are ironclad evidence of the US side's forced detention of POWs.
    The US side's illegal actions of using special agents to deprive POWs of exercising their right to be repatriated have not only been widely opposed and condemned by just world public opinion and all righteous people; even the American bourgeois press has admitted that this practice by the US side is a failure. The American "Christian Science Monitor" said that the US side's directing special agents to sabotage explanatory work and prevent POWs from applying for repatriation "set back the propaganda of the Allies." The American "Saturday Evening Post" more bluntly admitted that the US side's behavior of violating promises regarding the treatment of POWs in Korea "is another failure for the United States and for the principle of freedom." Now, the US side's complete tearing up of the agreement on the POW issue between the two sides of the armistice and its open use of force to forcibly detain POWs who have not listened to explanations further proves its complete political and moral bankruptcy. It must forever bear the serious responsibility for violating international conventions and agreements before the people of the world. The people of the world will further recognize the sinister face of American imperialism from this barbaric action of the US side. The Indian "Freedom Daily" condemned the US side's criminal act of forcibly detaining POWs, saying that it "once again shows how shamelessly the American authorities have degenerated."
    After using force to forcibly detain POWs, Dulles, Lodge, Herter, and others shamelessly attempted to portray this crime as some kind of "victory" for them. This is absolutely impossible to deceive anyone. The well-known fact is that in the fifteen months that the US side delayed the armistice negotiations and prolonged the Korean War in order to forcibly detain these POWs, the US military alone suffered more than 135,200 casualties. What kind of "victory" is it to implement the criminal act of forcibly detaining POWs at the cost of so many American soldiers' lives and blood? Only bloodthirsty American murderers would be complacent about this. Dulles, Lodge, and others also want to tout the US side's crime of seizing POWs as a "victory" for "humanity" and "freedom," but this inhumane crime of the US side has long been exposed by the countless bloody facts that occurred in US POW camps and has been condemned by just world public opinion. Indian Prime Minister Nehru also pointed out on January 23, after the US side seized the POWs: "It is said that their prisoners have been given freedom, but I simply cannot see what freedom they have in sending these POWs to countries where they cannot act according to their own wishes at all." It is absolutely impossible for American imperialists to use flowery words to cover up the political and moral bankruptcy they have suffered as a result of seizing POWs. On the contrary, these flowery words can only make people see more clearly that they are trying to cover up their bloody hands and make people more aware of their complete depravity.
    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has made great efforts in carrying out the work of the "scope of authority," but when the US side and its special agents obstructed and sabotaged the explanatory work, it has consistently failed to take effective measures in accordance with the rights granted to them by the "scope of authority" to ensure that all POWs have the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation. This time, under the pressure of the US side, disregarding the opposition expressed by the Korean and Chinese side in its reply letter on January 19th and disregarding the solemn protests of the Polish and Czechoslovakian members, the Commission illegally handed over the Korean and Chinese POWs to the US side, causing them to be subjected to forced detention. This not only does not conform to the provisions of the "scope of authority" and violates the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's own interpretation of the POW handling issue, but also actually facilitates the US side's realization of its conspiracy to forcibly detain POWs. The Chinese people, of course, cannot be satisfied with this.
    The Korean and Chinese side has made great and continuous efforts to seek a reasonable solution to the POW issue and to safeguard the full implementation of the "scope of authority." We firmly oppose the US side's provocative act of forcibly detaining POWs and destroying international conventions and agreements. As Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai solemnly stated: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, adhering to its consistent policy of peacefully resolving the Korean issue, and in order to prevent the US side's conspiracy to obstruct the road to peace in Korea from succeeding, solemnly declares: The United States side bears full responsibility at any time for tracing back and accounting for the more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese POWs who were forcibly detained this time and the more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese POWs who were forcibly detained from June 18 to 22, 1953; we also reserve the right to submit this issue to the Korean political conference and other relevant international conferences for discussion. And no matter when the political conference is held, no matter where these POWs are forcibly detained, as long as the US side does not trace them back, we will not give up pursuing this crime of the US side!" This is the common will of the entire Chinese people and is absolutely supported by all people who love peace, freedom, justice, and righteousness.
    Now, the US side's provocative action of forcibly detaining POWs has created more obstacles to the road to peace in Korea. Therefore, we firmly advocate that bilateral talks should be resumed immediately and that the Korean political conference should be convened as soon as possible to discuss the POW issue and seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. The Korean and Chinese side has made continuous efforts to promote the rapid convening of the political conference. In order to satisfy the urgent desire of the Korean and Chinese people and the peace-loving countries and people of the world to quickly convene the Korean political conference, Qi Shifu and Huang Hua, representatives of the Korean and Chinese side participating in the bilateral talks, sent a letter to Dean, the representative of the US side, on January 26, proposing that the bilateral talks resume on February 1, 1954, in Panmunjom. At the same time, the Korean and Chinese side expressed its willingness to carefully consider any suggestions regarding the date of resumption that the US side is willing to put forward. If the US side still has the intention of resuming bilateral talks for this reasonable proposal of the Korean and Chinese side, there is no reason to refuse it.
    In view of the US side's sabotage of the agreement on the POW issue between the two sides and its delay and obstruction of the convening of the political conference, which has made the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue more difficult, we believe that it is timely to immediately urge the resumption of the Eighth United Nations General Assembly to review and discuss the serious situation in Korea. Because, according to the purpose of the United Nations Charter, it is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. If the United Nations still has the intention to fulfill this responsibility, then it cannot turn a blind eye to the serious situation in Korea caused by the US side, but should immediately resume its session and must invite the governments of Korea and China to send representatives to participate in this discussion. The US government is afraid that its crimes in Korea will be further exposed and justly condemned before the people of the world. It is now making every effort to obstruct the resumption of the United Nations General Assembly and is inviting countries participating in the war of aggression against Korea to gather in Washington, attempting to pressure them to reject the proposal to resume the United Nations General Assembly on February 9. The US excuse is that "the General Assembly should not be reopened until certain decisions have been made on the resumption of Panmunjom talks." This completely exposes the US government's unreasonable attitude in international affairs. Everyone remembers that in the early stage of the Eighth UN General Assembly, the United States, on the one hand, did its best to delay the bilateral talks, and on the other hand, deliberately spread an optimistic atmosphere about the bilateral talks, and used this as an excuse to manipulate the majority in the United Nations to refuse to discuss the Korean issue; now, the bilateral talks have been unreasonably interrupted by the US side, according to the previous statement of the United States, the United Nations General Assembly should be discussing the Korean issue, but the US government is using this situation as an excuse to obstruct the resumption of the United Nations General Assembly. The US government's attitude actually regards the United Nations as a tool for it to destroy peace. All countries in the United Nations that are willing to peacefully resolve the Korean issue should resolutely oppose this obstruction conspiracy of the US government.
    Obviously, the US government's reason for delaying and obstructing the convening of the Korean political conference and the resumption of the United Nations General Assembly is that it has a more important conspiracy that cannot be disclosed. This is that some warmongers in the US ruling group oppose the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and try to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice, maintain the tense situation in the Far East and the world, so as to facilitate their continued pursuit of war policies, so as to seek the maximum profit for the American monopoly capital group. In recent months, American politicians and soldiers have been coming and going to the Far East and Asia like a revolving lantern to carry out conspiracy activities. Their attempts to establish military bases in certain Asian countries, organize military aggression groups, and actively arm Japan, and step up military aggression against Southeast Asia, fully expose this criminal purpose of the United States. In order to break the international tension created by this aggressive policy of the United States in Korea, Asia and around the world, we firmly support the proposal of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on January 26 at the Berlin Conference on "Measures to Ease International Tension and Convene a Conference of Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China." The Chinese people firmly believe that China, as a major country in Asia, has the right to express its opinions on urgent international affairs; only by convening a conference of the five major powers with the participation of the People's Republic of China to review and make decisions on current urgent international issues will it be more authoritative and will it meet the aspirations of the people of Asian countries. The Chinese people are deeply convinced that the convening of a conference of the five major powers will help ease international tensions, consolidate world peace, and help eliminate the serious obstacles that currently exist in the Korean issue.

### 美方劫夺战俘彻底破坏战俘问题协议  证明它在政治上和道义上的完全破产

　　美方劫夺战俘彻底破坏战俘问题协议
　　证明它在政治上和道义上的完全破产
    美国侵略者不顾国际信义，悍然于一月二十日和二十一日使用武装力量和东场里战俘营中的特务组织将二万一千九百余名未听解释的朝中战俘押解到南朝鲜的浦项和群山及台湾的基隆，并按照它预定的步骤，强迫这些战俘参加南朝鲜李承晚集团和台湾蒋介石残余匪帮的军队。美方这一有组织地强迫扣留战俘的罪恶行动，是他们在去年六月纵容李承晚集团劫夺二万七千余名我方被俘人员之后又一严重的挑衅行为。它不但彻底破坏了停战双方关于战俘问题的协议，严重地违反了朝鲜停战协定的规定，而且使得朝鲜问题的和平解决更加复杂和困难。
    我国周恩来外长于一月二十九日发表声明，对美方这种任意破坏国际公约和国际协议的罪恶行为，提出最强硬的抗议。周恩来外长指出：“现在，任何人都可以看清，美国方面对于国际公约和国际协议是随意破坏的，对于公理正义和人道原则是根本抹煞的，对于人类尊严和自由是横加蹂躏的。美方在战俘问题上进行的所谓心理战的全部过程，证明了它在政治上和道义上的完全破产。如果美方的这种罪恶政策不受到严厉的谴责和坚决的制止，那么，美方今天对朝中战俘实施的特务恐怖，明天就可能被用来对付全世界任何一个国家的人民。”因此，周恩来外长号召全世界爱好和平、自由和正义的人民坚决地行动起来，为制止美帝国主义者野蛮残暴的特务恐怖政策，为保障人类的自由、公理和正义而斗争。
    美方强迫扣留朝中战俘，是企图把战俘作为“冷战”的工具，以掩饰它侵朝战争的非正义性质和它在军事上、政治上的可耻失败。人所共知，美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争，是妄图并吞全部朝鲜并进而侵略我国的东北。但是美帝国主义的这一狂妄的侵略计划，在朝中人民及英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的沉重打击下，遭到了彻底的破产，因此，他们不得不在一九五一年六月接受苏联当时驻联合国代表马立克先生的建议，来与朝中方面开始停战谈判。朝中人民这一伟大的胜利，大大地鼓舞了远东和全世界爱好和平人民争取持久和平，反对美帝国主义侵略的勇气和信心。这对于美国政府继续推行其侵略政策，显然是极端不利的。因此，在停战谈判未开始以前，美方便打定主意要把朝中战俘强迫扣留下来，企图利用他们制造一种离奇的鬼话，向世界进行欺骗宣传，以掩盖他们的军事失败。为此，美方一直喧嚷什么朝中战俘“不愿意遣返”回家过和平生活，而“自愿”留在美国奴役下的南朝鲜和台湾那样的所谓“自由世界”充当炮灰！
    美国侵略者为了实现这种卑鄙的企图，一面用武装力量对我方被俘人员实行野蛮的屠杀；一面派遣大批李承晚集团和蒋介石匪帮特务混入战俘营，实行恐怖统治，胁迫战俘文身刺字，写血书，并进行血腥的“甄别”，制造所谓战俘不愿遣返的谎言。美方这种血腥恐怖的事实早就为美国将军杜德、柯尔生所证实。停战实现后，美方又使这些李承晚、蒋介石特务跟随不直接遣返的战俘进入了东场里战俘营。这些特务在美方的直接指使和配合之下，实行惨无人道的凶杀和其他恐怖手段，用暴力来控制和谋杀战俘，破坏解释工作的进行，阻挠战俘申请遣返，拒绝隔离听取解释；美方并影响瑞士、瑞典委员在中立国遣返委员会内部制造种种困难，致使朝中方面的解释工作仅仅进行了十天，绝大多数的战俘根本被剥夺了听取解释、行使遣返的权利。中立国遣返委员会一九五三年十二月二十八日提交双方的“临时报告”，不可动摇地确定了美方严重破坏停战协定中有关解释工作和战俘遣返协议的实施的责任。
    但是，尽管美方特务组织对战俘实行严密控制，在中立国遣返委员会看管期间，仍有五百余名战俘坚决要求回到朝中方面来。而在一月二十日、二十一日美方押运战俘时，虽然有美方特务组织的严密控制和美国的直接军事威胁，仍有约九十余名战俘冒死冲出来要求遣返。这些事实充分证明了我方被俘人员是坚决要求遣返的。如果能使“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”得到实施，使战俘能够摆脱美方特务的控制，给予他们听取解释、解除疑惧的充分机会，那末除了那些李承晚集团和蒋介石匪帮派去的特务以外，所有真正的朝中方面被俘人员，都是可以回到朝中方面来的。战俘冒着生命危险要求遣返的无数事实，完全揭露了美方所一贯叫嚣的什么战俘“宁死不愿遣返”的无耻谎言。这些事实就是美方强迫扣留战俘的铁证。
    美方利用特务剥夺战俘行使其被遣返权利的非法行动，不但遭到世界公正舆论和一切正义人类的广泛反对和斥责；就是美国资产阶级的报刊，也承认美方这种作法是一个失败。美国“基督教科学箴言报”说，美方指使特务破坏解释工作和阻止战俘申请遣返的“这件事情使盟国的宣传受到挫折”。美国的“星期六晚邮报”更率直地承认，美方破坏关于对待在朝鲜战俘问题的诺言的行为，“对于美国，对于自由原则，都又是一次失败。”现在美方彻底撕毁停战双方关于战俘问题的协议，公开用武力强迫扣留未听解释的战俘的行为，更证明它在政治上和道义上的彻底破产。它必须永远在全世界人民面前担负破坏国际公约和国际协议的严重责任。全世界人民将从美方这一野蛮行动中，更进一步认清美帝国主义的凶恶面目。印度“自由报”就指责说，美方强迫扣留战俘的罪恶行动，“又一次表明美国当局堕落到怎样的无耻境地”。
    美方在用武力强迫扣留战俘以后，杜勒斯、洛奇、赫尔之流恬不知耻地企图把这种罪行说成是他们的什么“胜利”。这是绝对欺骗不了任何人的。人所共知的事实是，美方为了强迫扣留这些战俘，在拖延停战谈判而使朝鲜战争延长的十五个月中，仅仅美国军队就遭受了十三万五千二百余名的死伤。不惜以这样多美国士兵的生命和鲜血为代价来贯彻强迫扣留战俘的罪恶行为，这是什么“胜利”呢？只有嗜血成性的美国杀人犯才会以此沾沾自喜。杜勒斯、洛奇之流还想把美方劫夺战俘的罪行吹嘘为“人道”和“自由”的“胜利”，但是，美方这种违背人道的罪行，早已为美方战俘营所发生的无数血腥事实所揭露，遭到了世界公正舆论斥责。印度总理尼赫鲁一月二十三日在美方劫走战俘之后也指出：“据说他们的俘虏已经得到自由，但是把这些战俘送到那些他们丝毫不能按照他们自己的愿望行事的国家去，我简直看不出他们有什么自由。”美帝国主义者想用花言巧语来掩盖它由于劫夺战俘而遭到的政治上和道义上的破产，是绝对办不到的。正相反，他们的这些花言巧语只能使人们更加看清他们是在想掩盖他们的血手，使人们更加认识他们的彻底的堕落。
    中立国遣返委员会在执行“职权范围”工作中曾作了很大的努力，但它在美方及其特务阻挠和破坏解释工作时，却一直未能根据“职权范围”所赋予它们的权利，采取有效措施，以保证全部战俘有机会行使遣返权利。委员会这次在美方的压力下，不顾朝中方面一月十九日在复信中所表示的反对意见，不顾波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员的严正抗议，非法地将朝中战俘交还美方，以致他们遭受了强迫扣留，这不仅不符合于“职权范围”的规定，违反了中立国遣返委员会自己对战俘处理问题所作的解释，而且，实际上是便利了美方实现其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。对此，中国人民当然不能满意。
    朝中方面对于谋求战俘问题的合理解决，对于维护“职权范围”的全部实施，都曾作了重大的不断努力。我们坚决反对美方强迫扣留战俘、破坏国际公约和国际协议的挑衅行为。正如周恩来外长所郑重声明的：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府本着坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯政策，并为了不许美方这种阻塞朝鲜和平道路的阴谋得逞，特郑重声明：美国方面对于这次被强迫扣留的二万一千九百余名朝中战俘和一九五三年六月十八日至二十二日被强迫扣留的二万七千余名朝中战俘在任何时候都负有全部追回、并向朝中方面提出交代的责任；我们并保留把这个问题提交朝鲜政治会议及其他有关国际会议讨论的权利。并且不论政治会议何时召开，不论这些战俘被强迫扣留在什么地方，只要美方一天不把他们追回，我们就一天不放弃对美方这种罪行进行追究！”这是全体中国人民的共同意志，也是为一切爱好和平、自由、正义和公理的人民所绝对支持的。
    现在，由于美国方面强迫扣留战俘的挑衅行动，已经使朝鲜和平的道路受到了更多的阻碍。因此，我们坚决主张，应该立即恢复双方会谈，安排朝鲜政治会议的早日召开，来讨论战俘问题及谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。朝中方面为促成政治会议的迅速召开，曾作了不断的努力。为了满足朝中人民及全世界爱好和平的国家和人民要求迅速召开朝鲜政治会议的迫切愿望，朝中方面参加双方会谈的代表奇石福、黄华又于一月二十六日致函美方代表迪安，提议双方会谈定于一九五四年二月一日在板门店复会。同时，朝中方面并表示准备以慎重的态度来考虑美方愿意提出的任何关于复会日期的建议。对于朝中方面这种合情合理的建议，如果美方尚有恢复双方会谈的意愿，是没有任何理由来加以拒绝的。
    鉴于美国方面破坏了双方关于战俘问题的协议，又拖延和阻挠政治会议的召开，使得朝鲜问题的和平解决更加困难，我们认为立即促使第八届联合国大会复会，以审查和讨论朝鲜的严重局势，是适合时宜的。因为，按照联合国宪章的宗旨，它负有维护国际和平与安全的责任。如果联合国还有履行它这种责任的意愿，那么，它对于美国方面所造成的朝鲜严重情况，就不能熟视无睹，而应当立即复会，并必须邀请朝中两国政府派遣代表参加这一讨论。美国政府害怕它在朝鲜所干的罪行在世界人民面前进一步被揭露并受到正义的谴责，现正竭力阻挠联合国大会复会，并正邀集参加侵朝战争的国家在华盛顿集会，企图压迫它们拒绝二月九日使联合国大会复会的建议。美国的借口是在“对恢复板门店谈判一事作出某些决定之前，不应重开联大”。这就完全暴露了美国政府在国际事务上的蛮横无理态度。大家还记得，在第八届联大的初期，美国一方面在双方会谈中尽力拖延，另一方面又故意散布关于双方会谈的乐观空气，并以此为借口来操纵联合国中的大多数拒绝讨论朝鲜问题；现在，双方会谈已被美方无理中断，按照美国前面的说法，联合国大会正应该讨论朝鲜问题才对，可是美国政府却又拿这种情况作为阻挠联合国大会复会的借口。美国政府这种态度，实际上是把联合国看做它破坏和平的工具。联合国中一切愿意使朝鲜问题和平解决的国家，应该坚决起来反对美国政府的这种阻挠阴谋。
    显然，美国政府之所以要拖延和阻挠朝鲜政治会议的召开和联合国大会的复会，还有它不可告人的更重大的阴谋。这就是美国统治集团中某些好战分子反对和平解决朝鲜问题，力图保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，保持远东和世界的紧张局势，以利于他们继续推行战争政策，好为美国垄断资本集团谋取最大利润。最近几个月来，美国的政客和军人像走马灯一样川流不息地来到远东和亚洲进行阴谋活动，他们企图在亚洲某些国家中建立军事基地，组织军事侵略集团，并积极武装日本，加紧对东南亚的军事侵略，都充分暴露了美国这一罪恶目的。为了打破美国这种在朝鲜、亚洲和世界各地推行侵略政策所造成的国际紧张局势，我们坚决支持苏联莫洛托夫外长一月二十六日在柏林会议中所提出的“关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议”的建议。中国人民坚决地认为，中国作为亚洲的大国，它有权利对迫切的国际事务表示自己的意见；只有召开有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议，来对当前迫切国际问题加以审查和作出决定，才更具有权威性，并将符合亚洲各国人民的愿望。中国人民深信，召开五大国会议，是有助于缓和国际紧张局势的，也有助于巩固世界和平，更将有助于消除目前存在于朝鲜问题上的严重障碍。
