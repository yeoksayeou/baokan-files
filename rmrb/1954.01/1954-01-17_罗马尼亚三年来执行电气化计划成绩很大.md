    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 16th: The Romanian people have achieved great success in the first three years of implementing the ten-year electrification plan (1951-1960).
    The Romanian ten-year electrification plan stipulates that generating capacity should be increased by one million kilowatts in the first five years. By the end of 1953, Romania's electricity production (calculated on a per capita basis) had reached 70% of the planned level for 1955. In the past three years, a number of modern and highly efficient thermal power stations and hydroelectric power stations have been successively completed and have begun generating electricity. The Moroni Hydropower Station, which was completed and started generating electricity in 1953, is fully equipped with new Soviet machinery. The generating capacity of the "Ovidiu II" thermal power station in Dobruja exceeds that of any other power station in the area. The electricity from the Gheorghiu-Dej thermal power station in Doicești can meet the needs of Bucharest, Stalin City, and the oilfields in the Prahova River basin. Currently, construction of one of the largest projects in Romania's ten-year electrification plan—the Lenin Hydropower Station on the Bistrița River in Bicaz—is in full swing. Tunneling workers have already excavated several kilometers of water supply tunnels through the mountains. At the end of the tunnel in Stejaru, a huge foundation pit for the hydropower station has been dug. The dam project, which started fourteen meters below the horizontal line, is also progressing rapidly. After its completion, this hydropower station will have a generating capacity of 210,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation of 430 million kilowatt-hours.
    The successive completion of Romanian power stations not only meets the needs of Romania's growing industry but also enables the successful electrification of Romania's rural areas and machine tractor stations. The amount of rural electrification work completed by Romania in the past three years would have taken seventy years to complete in the old society. At the same time, Romania's electrical industry has also developed rapidly. In 1953 alone, the output of electric motors increased sixtyfold compared to 1948, and the output of transformers increased twenty-threefold. The electrical equipment industry not only produces electrical equipment needed for light industry, the food industry, and agriculture, but also produces complete sets of generator equipment needed for power stations, as well as electrical equipment needed for coal mines, petroleum, metallurgy, machine manufacturing, timber, and other industries.

    罗马尼亚三年来执行电气化计划成绩很大
    【新华社十六日讯】布加勒斯特消息：罗马尼亚人民在执行十年电气化计划（一九五一—一九六○年）的头三年中，已取得了巨大成就。
    罗马尼亚十年电气化计划规定在头五年中增加一百万瓩的发电能力。到一九五三年年底为止，罗马尼亚的电力生产（按平均人口计算）已达到一九五五年预定水平的百分之七十。在过去三年中，已有一批现代化和效力强大的火力发电站和水力发电站陆续建成并开始发电。一九五三年落成发电的摩罗尼水电站，全部是由苏联新式机器装备起来的。多布鲁查的“奥维底乌第二”火力发电站的发电能力，超过了该地区任何其他电力站的发电能力。多塞希蒂的乔治乌—德治火力发电站的电力，可以满足布加勒斯特市、斯大林城和普拉霍瓦河流域的油田的需要。现在，罗马尼亚十年电气化计划中最大工程之一——贝卡兹的比斯特里查河畔的列宁水电站的建设工程，正在热烈地进行中。挖掘隧道的工人们通过大山已经开凿了好几公里的供水隧道。在隧道的终点斯蒂雅，水电站的一个巨大基坑已经挖掘好了。从水平线以下十四公尺开始进行的堤坝工程，进展得也很迅速。这个水电站落成后，发电能力将达二十一万瓩，每年发电量将达四亿三千万瓩时。
    罗马尼亚电力站的相继建成，不仅满足着日益发展的罗马尼亚工业的需要，而且还使罗马尼亚的农村和机器拖拉机站胜利地进行电气化的工作。过去三年中罗马尼亚所完成的农村电气化的工作，在旧社会要花上七十年的时间才能完成。和这同时，罗马尼亚电气工业也有了迅速的发展。单是一九五三年电动机的产量就增为一九四八年的六十倍，变压器的产量增为二十三倍。电气设备工业不仅生产了轻工业、食品工业和农业所需的电气设备，而且还生产了电力站所需的成套发电机设备，以及煤矿、石油、冶金、机器制造、木材等工业所需的电气设备。
