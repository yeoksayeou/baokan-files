Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 11th: Appendix 17 (B) of the “Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission Interim Report” contains twenty-eight letters intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces. These letters are undeniable evidence that the US side, through its intelligence network in the Southern camp, directed a strict special agent organization to sabotage explanation work and prevent the repatriation of prisoners of war. The Indian Custodial Forces intercepted these letters when US special agents were passing them into the camp from the outside or between camps.

The “Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission Interim Report” states: The “letters show the existence of a headquarters of prisoner of war organizations, and that the headquarters is located in Seoul, under the control of the Commander-in-Chief of the Republic of Korea Military Police. This headquarters is connected to four branch organizations that control six prisoner of war enclosures. The branch organizations control the camp organizations in all fifty-five camps. An effective communication system is in operation between these three levels of organization, with the United Nations Command's 64th Field Hospital constituting the most important link in this communication system.”

The most important of these letters is a secret directive issued on November 8, 1953, by Syngman Rhee and his Military Police Commander-in-Chief, Won Yong-duk, and the Kuomintang remnant bandit "Embassy" in South Korea from Seoul to the special agent heads in the camps. The content of this directive is already known to the world. In this directive, the Rhee-Chiang gang ordered their special agents "not to listen to explanations" and to "kill those who want to return to the North."

Inside the Southern camp, the special agent heads of the "branch organizations" frequently issued instructions to the special agents in each camp. Among the intercepted letters are several instructions issued by Moon Joong-ho, the head of the Syngman Rhee "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" "Nonsan Branch," to the special agents in each camp. In a letter issued to the "group leaders" of each camp on October 20, 1953, Moon Joong-ho said: "Yesterday, the Communist side promised the Indian troops that they would explain to the Chinese prisoners of war... They should know that we will never listen to the explanations."

Another special agent head, surnamed "Song," said in a letter to the "unforgettable comrades of the anti-communist organization" on October 15, 1953: "We are not here to listen to explanations... Our president (referring to Syngman Rhee) never told us to listen to explanations. Nor did he agree to the ceasefire."

The US military openly sent leaflets to the camps. An intercepted US military leaflet passed from Camp No. 13 to Camp No. 14 stated: "The United Nations Command" "will still not abandon you... will still help you go to Taiwan."

From how the Custodial Forces intercepted these letters and from the content of the letters, one can see the various methods used by the US special agents in the Southern camp to maintain contact with the outside world and with each other. The Custodial Forces intercepted letters from Syngman Rhee's special agents who were sent directly from Seoul to infiltrate the camp, intercepted letters when special agents in the camp handed them to the US-provided logistics vehicle drivers to take them out, and intercepted letters thrown between camps by special agents wrapped in stones. The special agent heads instructed the special agents in the camps to listen to orders from the radio, to attend camp "representative" meetings to exchange information, and to send people to the US 64th Field Hospital every day to receive instructions... Through these various channels, an "effective communication system" was maintained. The illegal existence and operation of this "communication system" was for the purpose of forcibly detaining more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

### “中立国遣返委员会临时报告”附件十七（乙）证明  美方通过情报网指挥特务破坏解释工作

    “中立国遣返委员会临时报告”附件十七（乙）证明
    美方通过情报网指挥特务破坏解释工作
    【新华社平壤十一日电】“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”附件十七（乙）里包含着被印度看管部队截获的二十八封信，这些信件就是美方通过其情报网指挥南营中的严密的特务组织破坏解释工作和阻止战俘遣返的无可抵赖的证据。印度看管部队是在美方特务自外面把信件传递至营场或在营场之间传递时，截获这些信件的。
    “中立国遣返委员会临时报告”中说：看管部队截获的“这些信件表明有战俘组织总部的存在，并表明总部地点在汉城，受大韩民国宪兵总司令官的控制。这一总部与控制六个战俘围场的四个分支组织是相联系的。分支组织则控制着所有五十五个营场中的营场组织。在这三层组织之间有一个有效的通讯系统在工作，联合国军第六十四野战医院在这一通讯系统中构成了最重要的一环。”
    这些信件中最重要的一封，是一九五三年十一月八日被看管部队截获的李承晚及其宪兵总司令官元容德和国民党残匪驻南朝鲜“大使馆”自汉城发给营场中特务头子的秘密指令。这个指令内容已为全世界所知悉。李蒋匪帮在这个指令中命令他们的特务“不应听解释”，“杀掉愿回北部的家伙”。
    在南营内部，“分支组织”的特务头子经常向各营场的特务发指示。被截获的信件中，有若干封就是李承晚“反共青年团”“论山支部”的头子文重浩发给各营场特务的指示。文重浩在一九五三年十月二十日发给各营场“小组长”的一封信中说：“昨天共产党方面答应印度部队说，他们将向中国战俘解释……他们应该知道我们是绝不会去听取解释的。”
    另一个姓“宋”的特务头子一九五三年十月十五日给“反共组织难忘的同志们”的信中说：“我们到这里来不是来听解释的……我们的总统（指李承晚）从来没有告诉我们要听解释。他也没有同意停火。”
    美军并公然把传单送到营场中去。被截获的从第十三号营场传递给第十四号营场的一张美军传单上说：“联合国军”“仍然不会放弃你们……仍将帮助你们去台湾”。
    从看管部队怎样截获这些信件以及信件的内容中，可以看到南营美方特务使用各种方法维持与外界的联系及他们相互间的联系。看管部队从汉城直接派来潜入营场的李承晚特务身上截获了信件，在营场里特务把信交给美方所提供的后勤汽车司机带出去时截获了信件，在营场间特务用信包在石块上投掷中截获了信件。特务头子的信中指示营场里的特务，要从广播中听取命令，去参加营场“代表”会议乘机交换情报，派人每天到美军第六十四野战医院领取指示……。通过这种种途径维持了一个“有效的通讯系统”。这个“通讯系统”的非法存在及其工作，就是为了强迫扣留二万多名朝中战俘。
