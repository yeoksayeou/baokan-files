　　Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition, Strive for Greater Glory
　　Heroic Father Zhang Benzhou

　　Recently, I met Zhang Benzhou, the father of Zhang Jihui, an air force hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in Qiaoshang Village, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province. Zhang Benzhou is nearly sixty years old this year, but he is full of vitality.

　　When I entered the village, Zhang Benzhou was planning the spring production with the members of the mutual aid team. He said: "We cannot be satisfied with the past production level. In 1954, we demanded that the grain yield per mu reach 500 to 550 jin. The land fertility is inexhaustible, and the yield has no limit."

　　Zhang Benzhou talked to me about the study of the general line. He said: "After studying the general line, I know that the mutual aid team is a socialist seedling, and we must cultivate this seedling." He also told me that since the publicity to sell surplus grain to the state, he discussed with his family to reduce the waste of grain by not feeding livestock with soybeans; he sold 3,000 jin of wheat and 1,000 jin of soybeans to the state. He used the money from selling grain to expand production. He also plans to subscribe for 500,000 yuan of national economic construction bonds.

　　Zhang Benzhou is an expert in production. He usually pays special attention to land processing and fertilization. In winter, when the whole village is still asleep, he carries a manure basket to collect manure. He often exchanges production experience with old farmers and young farmers. Last spring, Zhang Benzhou used fine varieties such as flattened wheat, climbing green beans, and "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes, and reaped a bumper harvest. During the wheat harvest, it rained continuously, so he led the team members to harvest in a planned way: first harvest the wheat on the mountains, then harvest the wheat nearby; first harvest the wheat that has turned yellow, then harvest the green wheat. In this way, all 20 mu of wheat in the team were harvested. While harvesting wheat, he also led the masses to plant soybeans, and the team reaped a bumper harvest of soybeans in the autumn. The Zhang Benzhou mutual aid team is a banner in Qiaoshang Village, and the masses in the whole village are learning from it. At the district appraisal meeting, Qiaoshang Village was named a model village for high yield, and Zhang Benzhou was named a model for high yield.

　　During the days I spent with Zhang Benzhou, I felt that this hero's father was so kind and amiable. He paid special attention to the work of substituting cultivation for other families of martyrs and soldiers, and often urged the people in the mutual aid team to cultivate the substituted land well. The villagers and the government thought that Zhang Benzhou was getting old and prepared to take more care of him and cultivate his land for him, but he was unwilling to accept it. He always took the initiative to help the poor families in the village, lending them his cattle and farm tools, or lending them food; when he heard that someone needed fine varieties, he always carried them to their door himself.

　　The masses in Qiaoshang Village all regard the hero's father with infinite gratitude. Every Spring Festival, people come in groups to express their condolences and congratulations to Zhang Benzhou, paste Spring Festival couplets on his door, and hang up lanterns of honor. Men and women, old and young, from neighboring villages also came to visit his home. During the harvest season, the women in the village took the initiative to help his family with some odd jobs, such as shelling corn and picking wheat straw.

　　Workers, farmers, shop assistants, students, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and overseas Chinese sent him enthusiastic letters. People affectionately called him father. Gao Fengru, a student at the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, wrote to Zhang Benzhou on March 21, 1953: "Uncle Zhang, I would like to call you father. You are so old, but you are still working diligently, and we young people should learn from you. Please believe that we are all proud that China has heroic father and son like you and Jihui..."

　　Model Military Dependent - Gu Yuzhi
      Nan Xu

　　Comrade Gu Yuzhi is 28 years old this year, and she is the wife of Zhang Molin, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. After Zhang Molin went abroad to Korea, she took a child at home to farm. The village wanted to cultivate her land for her, but she said: "I have been crawling in the fields since I was a child, and I don't need anyone to cultivate for me."

　　The year before last, during the busy farming season, the Shahe River rose, and the men in the village were busy repairing the dam, and no one was going to hoe the fields. She mobilized women to go to the fields to participate in labor and organized a nursery for the busy farming season. The Anshan Municipal Health Bureau thought this method was very good, so they sent two nursery workers to help her; since there were no houses to live in, she vacated her own house for them to live in. When the nursery was first established, many women did not believe in it. Some people said: "I can't even take care of my own child well, how can you take care of them when you are dressed so neatly?" Therefore, very few children were sent, and very few women went to the fields. Seeing this situation, Gu Yuzhi planned to go to various homes to mobilize, break through the mothers' thoughts, and let them go to the fields to work. More and more children were sent, and the nursery workers were too busy. Gu Yuzhi mobilized two more women, along with herself, to wash faces, feed meals, and change clothes for the children. The nursery looked like a real nursery, and the children were jumping and skipping. Pan Jingyuan's wife said: "In the past, I didn't like to go to the fields when I had children, but now that there is a nursery, even if the men have gone to the dam, I can go to the fields alone. The nursery really solves the problem!"

　　The year before last, in August, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Under the education of the Party, she clearly understood the direction of rural economic development and knew the benefits of organizing. She organized seven mutual aid teams in the village and led one team herself. When she first started organizing the mutual aid team, there were many difficulties. Because the team members did not understand the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation, they made trouble to withdraw from the team as soon as they encountered a little dissatisfaction. She patiently carried out propaganda and education, and actively led everyone to produce. The mutual aid team finally got going. Last year, the team members' annual harvest increased by more than two times compared with the previous year when they were working independently. She also organized team members to engage in sideline production, planting more than ten mu of land with cabbage. Most of the team members have now changed. For example, the adults and children of Gou Zhenjiu's family used to have nothing to eat for the next meal and could not afford clothes, but now they are all wearing new cotton-padded jackets and have no worries about food. Some villagers who were unwilling to join the mutual aid team in the past saw that Gu Yuzhi's mutual aid team was doing so well, and they all envied them and proposed to learn from Gu Yuzhi's mutual aid team.

　　Last year in July, the Shahe River rose, and it looked like the river dam was about to be washed down by the flood! She thought: If the river dam is washed away by the water, thousands of mu of crops will be flooded. I am a Communist Party member, and I cannot sit idly by. So, she bravely, barefoot, braved the torrential rain, and led the villagers to the dike to fight the flood. She fought against the flood on the dike for seven days and nights, and finally ensured the safety of the river dike, which enabled the crops to have a bumper harvest last year.

　　She also works hard in her studies. Now, her education level has been raised to the level of graduating from high school. In order to carry out rural maternal and child health work, she took the lead in learning the new method of midwifery and reforming the old midwives. Up to now, she has delivered 150 babies using the new method, and no errors have occurred in the technology.

　　Comrade Gu Yuzhi has a high reputation among the masses and has been elected by the masses as a district people's representative of Anshan City, a city people's representative, and is also an Anshan City special-class military dependent model, and is loved by the people of Anshan City. In her letter to her husband, she said: "I have been gloriously elected as the Anshan City special-class military dependent model, and I will definitely use practical actions to support the resistance against US aggression and aid Korea, and strengthen the economic construction of the motherland, to answer the training and love of Chairman Mao and the Party for me!"

　　发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣
    英雄的父亲张本周
    林涛
    最近，我在山东省荣成县的桥上村会见了中国人民志愿军空军英雄张积慧的父亲张本周。张本周今年已近六十岁了，但是他的身上却充满着一种活力。
    我进入村子时，张本周正和互助组的组员们计划着今春的生产。他说：“我们不能满足于过去的生产水平。一九五四年，我们要求每亩的粮食产量达到五百斤到五百五十斤。地力是用不尽的，产量是到不了顶的。”
    张本周和我谈到关于总路线的学习情形，他说：“经过总路线学习后，我知道互助组是社会主义的苗子，我们要把这个苗子培植起来。”他还告诉我，自宣传把余粮卖给国家以后，他跟全家人商量，不用大豆喂牲畜，以减少粮食的浪费；他先后卖给国家三千斤小麦，一千斤大豆。他用卖粮得来的钱，扩大了生产。他还准备认购五十万元的国家经济建设公债。
    张本周在生产中是个能手。平时他特别注意土地的加工和施肥。冬天当整个村子还在沉睡的时候，他就背着粪筐出去拾粪。他经常和年老的农民和青年农民交换生产经验。去年春天，张本周使用了扁穗小麦、爬蔓青豆、“胜利百号”地瓜等优良品种，获得了丰收。麦收期间，霪雨连绵，他有计划地带领全组组员进行收割：先割山上的小麦，后割近处小麦；先割已经黄熟的小麦，后割青麦。这样就把全组二十亩地的麦子都抢收下来了。在割麦时，他又领导群众种了大豆，秋季全组大豆又获得了丰收。张本周互助组在桥上村是一面旗帜，全村群众都向它学习。在区的评比大会上，桥上村被评为丰产模范村，张本周被评为丰产模范。
    在和张本周相处的日子里，我感到这位英雄的父亲对人是如此的和蔼可亲。他特别关心其他烈、军属的代耕工作，经常督促互助组里的人种好代耕土地。村里人和政府认为张本周年纪大了，准备多照顾他一些，替他代耕，但是他不愿意接受。对村里的困难户，他总是主动地去帮助，把自己的耕牛和农具借给他们使用，或借给他们食粮；听到谁需要优良品种，他总是亲自背着送上门。
    桥上村的群众，都以无限感激的心情来看待英雄的父亲。每年春节，人们成群结队地来向张本周慰问祝贺，在他的门前贴上春联，挂上光荣灯。邻近村庄的男女老少，也赶来到他家参观。在收割的季节里，村里的妇女群众主动地帮助他家做些零活，像剥包米，拣麦秸等等。
    各地工人、农民、店员、学生、解放军战士和海外的华侨，给他寄来了热情洋溢的信。人们亲热地喊他爸爸。北京师范大学女附中学生高凤茹在一九五三年三月二十一日给张本周的信中写道：“张老伯伯，我很想称您作父亲。您那么大年纪了，还是勤苦地劳动着，我们年青人应该向您学习。请您相信，我们都为中国有您和积慧这样的英雄父子而骄傲……。”
    模范军属——谷玉芝
      南　煦
    谷玉芝同志，今年二十八岁，她是中国人民志愿军战士张墨林的妻子。张墨林出国到朝鲜以后，她带着一个小孩在家种地，村里要给她代耕，她说：“我从小就在地里爬，不用人给我代耕。”
    前年，农忙时沙河水涨，村里的男人都忙着修坝，没人去锄地。她就一面动员妇女下地参加劳动，一面组织农忙托儿所。鞍山市卫生局认为这个办法很好，就给派了两个保育员去帮助她；没有房子住，她就把自己的房子腾了出来让她们住。托儿所刚成立时，许多妇女都不相信它，有人说：“我一个孩子自己带也带不好，你们穿得干干净净的，怎能带好？”因此，送来的孩子很少，妇女也很少下地去。谷玉芝看到这种情况，就有计划地到各家去动员，打通母亲们的思想，让她们下地劳动。孩子越送越多，保育员忙不过来，谷玉芝又动员了两名妇女，连同她自己五人，给孩子洗脸、喂饭、换衣裳。托儿所像个样子了，孩子都蹦蹦跳跳的。潘景园的妻子说：“过去，我有了孩子就不爱下地，现在有了托儿所，男人虽然上了坝，我一个人也可以下地了。托儿所真解决问题！”
    前年八月，她光荣地参加了中国共产党。在党的教育下，她明确认识了农村经济发展的方向，知道了组织起来的好处。她在村里组织了七个互助组，自己领导一个组。开始组织互助组时困难很多，组员因不了解互助合作的好处，只要碰到一点不如意，就闹退组。她就耐心地进行宣传教育，并积极地领导大家生产，互助组终于搞起来了。去年组员的全年收获量，比前年单干时增加两倍多。她又组织组员进行副业生产，将十多亩地全种上白菜。多数组员现在已变样了，例如勾振九家的大人小孩过去吃了上顿没下顿，衣服也穿不上，现在都穿上了新棉袄，吃的也不愁了。村里有些老乡过去不愿参加互助组，看到了谷玉芝互助组搞得那么好，个个羡慕，提出要向谷玉芝互助组学习。
    去年七月间，沙河水涨，眼看河坝就要被洪水冲倒啦！她想：河坝被水冲坏了，数千亩庄稼就要被淹没。我是一个共产党员，不能坐着看。于是，她奋不顾身，赤着脚，冒着倾盆大雨，带领老乡上堤抢险，在堤上与洪水搏斗，坚持了七昼夜，终于保证了河堤的安全，使去年庄稼获得丰收。
    她在学习上也很努力，现在，她的文化程度已经提高到高小毕业的水平了。为了开展农村的妇幼卫生工作，她带头学习新接生法，改造旧产婆。到现在，她已用新法接生了一百五十个孩子，在技术上没有发生过错误。
    谷玉芝同志在群众中有着很高的威信，被群众推选为鞍山市的区人民代表、市人民代表，又是鞍山市特等军属模范，受到鞍山市人民的热爱。她在给丈夫的信中说：“我已光荣地被选为鞍山市的特等军属模范，我一定要用实际行动来支援抗美援朝，加强祖国的经济建设，来回答毛主席和党对我的培养和爱护！”（附图片）
