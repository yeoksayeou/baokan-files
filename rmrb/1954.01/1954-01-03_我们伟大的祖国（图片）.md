    Our Great Motherland
    After receiving propaganda and education on the general line of the state's transition period, the peasants in Litun Village, Yongji County, Jilin Province, have sold more than 800 tons of surplus grain to the state, exceeding the plan by 150 tons. The peasants are also actively purchasing large quantities of means of production in preparation for expanding reproduction next year. This is the cart, horse, and rubber tires they bought back. As soon as they arrived at the entrance of the village, the masses rushed to welcome them.
