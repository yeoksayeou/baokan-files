    The Central Committee of our Party has issued a decision on developing agricultural producers' cooperatives. This decision summarizes the experiences of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production in various regions, especially the experiences of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives over the past two years. The focus of this decision is to promote the great development of mutual aid teams and drive the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement forward by running and developing agricultural producers' cooperatives well. This decision, together with the Central Committee's decision on mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production announced in March 1953, clearly outlines the correct path and specific methods for the socialist transformation of agriculture. Party committees at all levels, especially all comrades engaged in rural work, must carefully study this decision, take it as a guide for their work, and correctly implement it in all rural work.
    In recent years, especially since the winter of 1951, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production has generally developed well throughout the country. As of October 1953, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives had reached 43 percent of the total number of rural households nationwide, including more than 14,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives with the participation of more than 273,000 peasant households. In terms of production, the output of agricultural producers' cooperatives is generally higher than that of mutual aid teams, and the output of mutual aid teams is generally higher than that of individual farmers, which has become a fact recognized by the vast majority of peasants. In responding to the calls of the Party and the People's Government on various political and economic tasks, and in grain purchasing work, organized farmers, especially those participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives, have demonstrated an active leading role, showing the improvement of their level of awareness. This proves that in order to achieve a large increase in agricultural production, we must rely on the development of mutual aid and cooperation, and the development of various rural tasks must also rely on the development of mutual aid and cooperation. At present, as far as the whole country is concerned, the current situation in rural areas is that the individual small-scale peasant economy occupies a dominant position. Various rural tasks must be based on this actual situation and must take into account the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy. At the same time, we must actively transform the small-scale peasant economy, and never be satisfied with the status quo of the small-scale peasant economy and ignore the socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy. Because if socialism does not occupy the rural front, capitalism will. Therefore, this decision points out: "If we adopt a passive and laissez-faire attitude towards the mutual aid and cooperation movement, if we are only satisfied with the status quo of the small-scale peasant economy and do not point out the correct, bright, and broad path of socialist transformation for the small-scale peasant economy, then it will inevitably develop into abandoning the socialist front in the countryside, helping the growth of spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside, and thus inevitably hindering the rise of agricultural productive forces and the continued improvement of farmers' lives, damaging the balance between industry and agriculture, damaging the planned economy and national industrialization, and damaging the worker-peasant alliance. This policy and practice is obviously wrong."
    Precisely because the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production has already reached an increasingly expanding scale, the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policy has increasingly gained the support of the broad masses of working peasants, and has increasingly become a widespread mass practice. At the same time, after vigorously publicizing the Party's general line in rural areas and conducting extensive and in-depth education for peasants comparing the new and old roads of socialism and capitalism, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for mutual aid and cooperation will be unprecedentedly high, which can be expected. In addition, the work of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives, after several years of trial implementation at various levels, the leading organs at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels in the old areas, and the leading organs at the provincial level, most prefectural levels, and some county levels in the new areas, have initially gained experience in running cooperatives, and the cadres and peasant masses in the villages where the existing more than 14,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives are located have also initially learned the practical experience of running cooperatives, and the cadres and peasants in the surrounding villages have also received vivid and realistic education from those agricultural producers' cooperatives that have achieved success. All of this has created favorable conditions for further developing agricultural producers' cooperatives. The implementation of the general line for the transition period and the development of national socialist industrialization also require the active development of the mutual aid movement, the active development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the adaptation of the socialist transformation of agriculture to the development of socialist industrialization. Therefore, this decision of the Central Committee of the Party particularly emphasizes the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, stipulating that within one year from the winter of 1953 to the autumn harvest of 1954, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives nationwide should increase from the existing more than 14,000 to more than 35,800. In the new areas, except for a few counties with special circumstances or very backward work, general counties should organize one, two, or three agricultural producers' cooperatives within this year. In the old areas, the development should be increased by one time, one and a half times, or two times compared to the existing number of cooperatives within this year. According to the materials from major regions and provinces in the recent two months, the development plan of more than 35,800 agricultural producers' cooperatives stipulated in the decision can be completed and even exceeded. Including the existing number of cooperatives, it may reach about 40,000 to 45,000 by 1954. It is necessary for various regions to propose certain control figures when developing agricultural producers' cooperatives, but as long as the masses are voluntary, meet the conditions, regulations, and decisions, and have fair and capable leading backbone, agricultural producers' cooperatives can be run well, and should not be mechanically restricted by numbers. However, if these conditions are lacking or not met, these conditions should be actively prepared, and cooperatives should be established after the conditions are prepared, rather than blindly pursuing development figures. It is required that the secretaries of party committees at all levels be responsible, take action personally, proceed from the actual situation in their localities, organize all the forces that can be invested in this work, and run agricultural producers' cooperatives well, so that, as pointed out in the Central Committee's decision, they can "more and faster drive the individual economy to develop towards mutual aid teams, and pave the way for more development of agricultural producers' cooperatives."
    The mark of whether an agricultural producers' cooperative is run well is whether production is increased and whether the income of cooperative members is increased. Increasing production and increasing income are the concentrated embodiment of doing a good job in various tasks of agricultural producers' cooperatives. In order to increase production and increase the income of cooperative members, it is necessary to gradually carry out the basic construction of agriculture and the work of production reform, it is necessary to do a good job in the management and administration of the cooperative, rationally organize and use labor, and gradually establish production plans and necessary and feasible financial accounting systems and responsibility systems with dedicated personnel and dedicated responsibilities. However, the construction of all basic infrastructures, the promotion of production reforms, and the establishment of management methods and various systems must be gradual, from low-level to high-level, from simple to complex, from relatively reasonable to completely reasonable, and must be based on the needs of production development, and the masses have already experienced this need in their own actual production activities, then these management methods and systems can truly become something consciously observed by the masses, and can truly achieve practical results; they cannot be prescribed too high, too strict, too complicated, or too mechanical at once, otherwise, they will inevitably become detached from the masses and hinder the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives. At present, there are individual places where, on the one hand, the peasant masses urgently demand to organize agricultural producers' cooperatives, and on the other hand, the county and district cadres see that the standards for running cooperatives are too high and are afraid of not running them well, and they are constrained and restrict the enthusiasm of the masses. This phenomenon should be studied and changed. Agricultural producers' cooperatives must not only increase production, but also practice strict economy and do a good job in distribution, in order to actually increase the income of all cooperative members. The Central Committee of the Party pointed out in the decision: "Economy is the fundamental method of socialist enterprise management, and it is also the fundamental method of agricultural producers' cooperative management. Cooperatives must save expenses, reduce miscellaneous expenses, eliminate corruption and waste, and avoid blind investment, so as to avoid excessive costs." Some agricultural producers' cooperatives have the phenomenon of increased production but not increased income for cooperative members due to high investment, high costs, and large waste. Significant changes have occurred since 1953, but not all cooperatives have completely resolved this problem, and continued efforts are still needed in this regard. When dealing with the distribution of income, it must be recognized that the existing form of agricultural producers' cooperative is a transitional form to a completely socialist cooperative, containing the nature of both private and cooperative aspects. The distribution of its income must take into account both aspects at the same time, and take into account that all cooperative members can obtain reasonable benefits, so that this reasonable distribution system can consolidate the internal unity of agricultural producers' cooperatives and promote the development of agricultural production. At present, some cooperatives have the phenomenon of overly high or low remuneration for labor and remuneration for land and livestock, thus increasing the income of some cooperative members and reducing the income of other cooperative members, which is detrimental to the consolidation and development of agricultural producers' cooperatives and should be appropriately changed.
    The Central Committee of the Party also pointed out in this decision: "We must pay attention to strengthening the leadership of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives, and at the same time, we must strengthen the leadership of developing various forms of mutual aid teams." Because mutual aid teams currently exist in large numbers and are much more numerous than agricultural producers' cooperatives in terms of quantity; moreover, for peasants, mutual aid teams are an easier form of organization to accept than agricultural producers' cooperatives. "The mutual aid movement prepares the conditions of mass experience and leading backbone for agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the development of mutual aid teams is an important foundation for the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives." Although under certain conditions, it is permissible for individual farmers to directly organize agricultural producers' cooperatives without going through mutual aid teams; however, the general law of development is still to develop into agricultural producers' cooperatives through temporary and permanent mutual aid teams. The view of neglecting mutual aid teams has grown somewhat recently in some places, and they do not pay attention to the leadership of mutual aid teams, concentrating the party member activists in general mutual aid teams to agricultural producers' cooperatives, so that the mutual aid teams are in a state of unled dissolution; they do not pay sufficient attention to studying and utilizing the inherent mutual aid habits and mutual aid forms of peasants, believing that they do not meet the specifications, do not recognize them, and do not lead and gradually improve them. This view must be changed. The Central Committee of the Party instructs us in this decision: "Party committees at all levels should pay full attention to studying and utilizing the inherent mutual aid habits and mutual aid forms of peasants, helping the peasant masses to gradually and widely organize to solve difficulties in production, and gradually transform and improve them in the development process of the mutual aid movement, removing their original unreasonable components and increasing reasonable components." We must overcome the view of neglecting low-level mutual aid forms according to this instruction, and we must understand that both the low-level form of mutual aid teams and the existing form of agricultural producers' cooperatives are transitional forms that gradually transition to completely socialist cooperatives. It is also wrong to pay more attention to agricultural producers' cooperatives and neglect the work of mutual aid teams.
    At the same time, it is also necessary to "fully, enthusiastically, and without barriers care for, help, and patiently educate individual farmers...in the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, just as in other tasks carried out in rural areas…All mutual aid and cooperation organizations must become the core of uniting the surrounding individual farmers." Because individual farmers are still the majority of farmers at present and still have a certain degree of enthusiasm for production. Although the individual economy cannot often expand reproduction, even if it can increase production, it is limited. In publicizing the Party's general line in the transition period and developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, explaining the limitations of the increased production of the individual small-scale peasant economy is completely necessary and correct, and criticizing the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the small-scale peasant economy is also completely necessary and correct, but we cannot therefore obliterate the fact that individual farmers still have a certain potential for production; we cannot discriminate against and attack individual farmers, making mutual aid and cooperation farmers and individual farmers oppose each other; we cannot equate individualism with the spontaneous capitalist tendencies and rich peasant exploitation in rural areas, otherwise, it would be very wrong. "Our concern for and appropriate care for individual farmers now makes it possible for these individual farmers to gradually join mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the future, and it is also possible to achieve our ultimate goal in rural areas—guiding all farmers towards socialism and communism." This is what the Central Committee of the Party has repeatedly pointed out. While strengthening the leadership of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives, various regions must earnestly avoid the mistakes of neglecting mutual aid teams and attacking and discriminating against individual farmers.
    From mutual aid teams with socialist characteristics in their infancy to the existing form of semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives, and then to completely socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives (collective farms), this is the general law of the development of mutual aid and cooperation. The road of organization, mutual aid and cooperation, and socialism planned by the Central Committee of the Party for Chinese peasants is a road of steady progress and gradual transition. Through this road, millions of individual peasants naturally and unforcedly transition to complete socialism, making the individual small-scale peasant economy cooperate with the development of our country's socialist industrialization, gradually unite, gradually develop agricultural production, and gradually transition to the socialist agricultural economy of mechanized large-scale production. Adopting this road of steady progress and gradual transition can achieve, as the Central Committee of the Party pointed out, that the broad masses of peasants "do not feel sudden when they enter the completely socialist economic system of agriculture, but are prepared both spiritually and materially beforehand, and thus can avoid the various losses that may be caused by sudden changes." That is to say, in order to enable our country's socialist industrialization to develop forward on a stable and reliable basis, it not only requires the realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture, but also requires the avoidance of sudden changes in the steps of realizing this transformation, and therefore must adopt the method of steady progress, gradual transition, and gradual transformation.
    Finally, the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, like carrying out other tasks in rural areas, must "thoroughly implement the Party's current policy of relying on the solid alliance of poor and middle peasants, gradually developing mutual aid and cooperation, and restricting rich peasant exploitation—this systematic policy." After the land reform, many poor peasants rose to the status of middle peasants, and some poor peasants have not risen to the status of middle peasants, and there are also individual middle peasants who have been reduced to the status of poor peasants due to natural disasters (some landlords and rich peasants have been reduced to the economic status of poor peasants after the land reform, and these people should not be counted among the poor peasants). The restoration and development of agricultural production in recent years and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement have made middle peasants become or will become the majority of the rural population. Therefore, the solid alliance of poor and middle peasants is of decisive significance to the success or failure of the socialist transformation of rural areas. Rich peasant exploitation must be restricted, but the steps must be gradual and the methods must be appropriate, and it cannot be too fierce or too hasty. Otherwise, it will inevitably harm the middle peasants, which is also extremely unfavorable to us. Avoiding harming the enthusiasm of the middle peasants is the fundamental reason for gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture and avoiding sudden changes. Therefore, we must firmly grasp the policy of "active leadership and steady progress" instructed by the Central Committee, and we must earnestly grasp the objective actual situation at the time and in the local area, and we must not lag behind the demands of the masses and the needs of national construction, nor should we exceed the level of awareness of the masses and disregard possible conditions, we must neither commit subjectivist errors nor commit commandist errors, thereby ensuring that the Central Committee's decision on developing agricultural producers' cooperatives is correctly implemented, and systematically and gradually complete the work of transforming the small-scale peasant economy, so that our country's agriculture gradually transitions to socialism.

### 正确地贯彻中国共产党中央委员会  关于发展农业生产合作社的决议

    正确地贯彻中国共产党中央委员会
    关于发展农业生产合作社的决议
    我们党的中央委员会发布了关于发展农业生产合作社的决议。这个决议总结了各地农业生产互助合作运动的经验，特别是总结了两年来发展农业生产合作社的经验。这个决议的重点，是以办好和发展农业生产合作社来带动互助组的大发展，带动整个互助合作运动前进。这个决议，连同一九五三年三月公布的中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议，清楚明白地规划出对农业实行社会主义改造的正确道路和具体办法。各级党委，特别是一切从事农村工作的同志们，必须用心学习这个决议，把它当做自己工作的指南，在农村的各项工作中正确地把它贯彻执行。
    几年以来，特别是一九五一年冬季以来，农业生产互助合作运动在全国各地一般有了很好的发展。截至一九五三年十月为止，参加互助组和农业生产合作社的农户，已达全国农村总户数的百分之四十三，其中农业生产合作社有一万四千多个，参加者有二十七万三千多农户。在生产上，农业生产合作社的产量一般高于互助组，互助组的产量一般高于单干农民，这已成为广大农民所公认的事实。在响应党和人民政府的各项政治经济工作的号召上，在粮食收购工作中，组织起来的农民，特别是参加农业生产合作社的农民，表现了积极的带头作用，显示出他们的觉悟水平之提高。这证明，要达到大量增加农业生产，必须依靠于发展互助合作，农村各项工作的开展也必须依靠于发展互助合作。目前就全国说来，农村的现状固然是个体的小农经济占居优势，农村各项工作必须根据这种实际情况，必须估计到小农经济的特点，但同时又必须积极地去改造小农经济，而绝不能安于小农经济的现状，忽视对小农经济的社会主义改造。因为，农村阵地社会主义不去占领，资本主义必去占领。因此，这个决议中指出：“如果我们对于互助合作运动采取消极的放任自流的态度，如果我们只安于小农经济的现状，不给小农经济指出社会主义改造这一条正确的光明的和广阔的出路，那就一定会发展到放弃社会主义在农村的阵地，帮助农村资本主义自发势力的生长，因而也就一定会妨碍农业生产力的上升和农民生活的继续改善，破坏工业与农业的平衡，破坏计划经济和国家工业化，破坏工农联盟。这种方针和作法是显然错误的”。
    正因为农业生产互助合作运动已有日益扩大的规模，党的互助合作政策已经日益获得广大劳动农民的拥护，日益成为广大群众性的实践。同时，在农村中在大张旗鼓地宣传党的总路线，广泛深入地对农民进行社会主义和资本主义新旧两条道路对比的教育以后，广大农民群众的互助合作的积极性将空前地高涨，这是可以预期的。加之，发展农业生产合作社的工作，经过几年来的逐级试办，现在老区的省、专区、县三级和部分区级的领导机关，新区的省级、多数专区级和部分县级的领导机关，已初步取得了办社的经验，现有的一万四千多个农业生产合作社所在乡村的干部和农民群众也初步学到了办社的实际经验，其周围乡村的干部和农民也从那些办得有成绩的农业生产合作社获得了生动现实的教育。所有这一切，都为进一步发展农业生产合作社创造了有利条件。过渡时期总路线的贯彻实施和国家社会主义工业化的发展，也要求积极发展互助运动，积极发展农业生产合作社，要求对农业的社会主义改造工作能与社会主义工业化的发展相适应。因此，在党中央这个决议中特别强调发展农业生产合作社，规定从一九五三年冬季到一九五四年秋收的一年之内，全国农业生产合作社应由现有的一万四千多个发展到三万五千八百多个。在新区，除少数情况特殊或工作很落后的县份外，一般的县在这一年之内，都要组织一个、两个或者三个农业生产合作社。老区在这一年之内，应比照现有的社数加一倍、一倍半或两倍地发展。从最近两个月各大区各省的材料看来，决议所规定的三万五千八百多个农业生产合作社的发展计划是可以完成，并且可以超过的，连同现有的社数在内，到一九五四年可能达到四万到四万五千个左右。各地在发展农业生产合作社时提出一定的控制数字，是必要的，但只要是群众自愿的，合乎条件、章程和决议的，又有公道和能干的领导骨干，农业生产合作社就可以办好，就不应该机械地按数目字加以限制。但如果缺乏或不具备这些条件，就应积极地准备这些条件，待条件准备好了以后再行建社，而不要盲目地追求发展数字。要求各级党委书记负责，亲自动手，从当地的实际情况出发，组织一切可以投入这一工作的力量，办好农业生产合作社，以便如中央决议中所指出的“更多地和更快地带动个体经济向互助组发展，并为更多地发展农业生产合作社开辟道路”。
    农业生产合作社办得好坏的标志就是生产是否提高，社员收入是否增加。增加生产，增加收入，是农业生产合作社做好各项工作的集中体现。为增加生产，增加社员收入，就必须逐步地举办农业的基本建设和生产改革的工作，就必须做好合作社的经营管理工作，合理地组织使用劳动力，逐步地建立生产计划和必要的可行的财务会计制度和专职专责的责任制度。但一切基本建设之兴办，生产改革之推行，以及经营管理方法和各种制度之建立，必须是逐步的，由低级到高级的，由简单到复杂的，由比较合理到完全合理的，必须根据生产发展的需要，而且群众在其自身的实际生产活动中已经体验到这种需要，然后这些管理方法和制度才能真正成为群众自觉遵守的东西，才能真正收到实效；不能一下子规定得过高，过严，过于繁琐，过于机械，否则势必脱离群众，而阻碍农业生产合作社的发展。目前，已有个别地方一方面农民群众迫切要求组织农业生产合作社，另一方面县区干部看到办社的标准要求过高，怕办不好，而束手束脚，限制了群众的积极性，这种现象应加研究和改变。农业生产合作社既须增加生产，又须厉行节约和做好分配工作，才能在实际上增加全体社员的收入。党中央在决议中指出：“节约是社会主义企业经营的根本方法，也是农业生产合作社经营的根本方法。合作社必须节约开支，减少杂费，杜绝贪污和浪费，不要盲目投资，以免成本过大”。有些农业生产合作社因投资多，成本高，浪费大，有增产而不增加社员收入的现象，一九五三年以来已有显著的转变，但还不是所有的合作社都已完全解决了，仍须在这一方面继续努力。在处理收益的分配问题时，必须认识现有形式的农业生产合作社是走向完全社会主义的合作社的过渡形式，包含有私有的和合作的这两方面的性质，其收益的分配必须同时照顾这两个方面，照顾全体社员都能获得合理利益，从而使这种合理的分配制度能以巩固农业生产合作社的内部团结，并促进农业生产之发展。目前有些合作社劳动力所得的报酬和土地耕畜所得的报酬有偏高偏低的现象，因而使一部分社员的收入加多而另一部分社员的收入减少，这对农业生产合作社的巩固与发展是不利的，应适当予以改变。
    党中央在这个决议中又指出：“我们要注意加强发展农业生产合作社的领导，同时又必须加强发展各种形式互助组的领导”。因为，互助组在目前是大量存在的，比之农业生产合作社在数量上要多得多；而且，对农民说来，互助组比之农业生产合作社是较易接受的组织形式，“互助运动是为农业生产合作社准备了群众经验和领导骨干的条件，互助组的发展是农业生产合作社发展的重要基础”。虽然在一定的条件之下，由个体农民不经过互助组，而直接组织农业生产合作社，也是可以允许的；但一般的发展规律，仍是经过临时的和常年的互助组而发展成为农业生产合作社。有些地方轻视互助组的观点近来有所滋长，不注意对互助组的领导，把一般互助组中的党员积极分子都集中到农业生产合作社去，以致使互助组处于无领导的涣散状态；不充分注意研究和利用农民固有的互助习惯和互助形式，认为它不合规格，不承认它，不去领导和一步一步地提高它。这种观点是必须改变的。党中央在这个决议中指示我们：“各地党委应该充分注意研究和利用农民固有的互助习惯和互助形式，帮助农民群众能够逐步广泛地组织起来，以解决生产上的困难，并在互助运动的发展过程中，逐步加以改造和提高，去掉其原来不合理的成分，增加合理的成分”。我们必须根据这一指示，克服轻视低级互助形式的观点，必须了解低级形式的互助组和现有形式的农业生产合作社，都是逐步地过渡到完全的社会主义的合作社的过渡形式，因加强注意农业生产合作社而不重视互助组的工作，这也是错误的。
    同时，也必须按照中央所指示的，“在发展互助合作运动中，同样地……要充分地满腔热情地没有隔阂地去照顾、帮助和耐心地教育单干农民。……一切互助合作组织必须成为团结周围单干农民的核心”。因为单干农民目前还是农民中的多数，还有一定的生产积极性。虽然个体经济是不能经常扩大再生产的，即使能够增产也是有限的，在宣传党在过渡时期的总路线和发展互助合作运动中，说明个体小农经济的增产的局限性是完全必要的和正确的，批判小农经济之自发的资本主义倾向也是完全必要的和正确的，但不能因此抹杀单干农民还有一定的生产潜在力量；不能岐视和打击单干农民，使互助合作的农民与单干农民互相对立起来；不能把单干与农村的自发资本主义倾向和富农剥削混同起来，否则就是很错误的。“我们在现在表示关心和适当地照顾单干农民，就有可能使这些单干农民在将来逐步地加入互助合作组织，也就有可能实现我们在农村中的最后目的——引导全体农民走向社会主义和共产主义”。这是党中央所一再指出的，各地在加强注意发展农业生产合作社的领导时，必须切实避免轻视互助组和打击岐视单干农民的错误。
    由具有社会主义性质萌芽的互助组，到现有形式的半社会主义的农业生产合作社，再到完全社会主义的农业生产合作社（集体农庄），这是互助合作发展的一般规律。党中央为中国农民所规划的这个组织起来、互助合作、到社会主义的道路，是稳步前进、逐步过渡的道路。经过这条道路，使千百万个体农民自然而然地不勉强地过渡到完全的社会主义，使个体的小农经济配合着我们国家的社会主义工业化的发展，逐步地联合起来，逐步地发展农业生产，逐步地过渡到机械化的大规模生产的社会主义的农业经济。采取这种稳步前进，逐步过渡的道路，就可以做到如党中央所指出的，使广大农民“在他们进到农业的完全社会主义的经济制度的时候不感到突然，而是事先有了精神的和物质的准备的，因而能够避免由于突然变化所可能引起的种种损失”。这就是说，为使我们国家的社会主义工业化能以在稳定可靠的基础上向前发展，不仅要求实现对农业的社会主义改造，而且要求在实现这种改造的步骤上避免突然变化，因而必须采取稳步前进、逐步过渡、逐步改造的办法。
    最后，发展互助合作运动，也同在农村中开展其他各项工作一样，必须“贯彻执行党在目前时期关于依靠贫农和中农的巩固联盟，逐步发展互助合作，限制富农剥削——这一系统的政策”。在土地改革后，许多贫农上升为中农，还有部分贫农没有上升到中农，也还有个别中农因天然灾害降为贫农（有一部分地主富农经过土地改革而下降到贫农的经济地位，这种人不应算在贫农之内），几年来农业生产的恢复和发展，互助合作运动的发展，中农已成为或将成为农村人口的多数，因此贫农和中农的巩固联盟对于农村社会主义改造事业的成败具有决定的意义。富农剥削，必须加以限制，但步骤必须是逐步的，方式必须是适当的，不能过猛过急。否则，势必伤害到中农，这对我们也是极其不利的。避免伤害中农的积极性，就是必须逐步实现对农业的社会主义改造而避免突然变化的根本理由。因此，我们必须紧紧掌握中央所指示的“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，必须切实掌握当时当地的客观实际情况，既不应当落后于群众的要求和国家建设的需要，又不应当超过群众的觉悟程度和不顾可能的条件，既不要犯主观主义的错误，又不要犯命令主义的错误，从而保证党中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议正确地贯彻执行，有计划地逐步地完成改造小农经济的工作，使我国农业逐步地过渡到社会主义。
