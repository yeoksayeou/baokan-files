Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th: After thoroughly, extensively, and comprehensively carrying out propaganda and education on the general line of the state during the transition period in rural areas of Northeast China, the enthusiasm of farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations has been greatly enhanced. At present, Party and government leading organs at all levels have begun to prepare for the establishment of new agricultural production cooperatives in 1954. Based on existing conditions and the demands of the farmers, the region preliminarily plans to establish 7,700 agricultural production cooperatives in the spring of 1954, which is about one and a half times more than the total number of existing agricultural production cooperatives in the region. In order to do a good job in establishing cooperatives, various provinces have successively begun to train cadres for establishing cooperatives and carry out pilot projects for establishing cooperatives, and summarize the experience of district-level cooperative management in 1953. Twenty-eight counties in Heilongjiang Province have completed the pilot work of establishing cooperatives, of which eleven counties have trained more than 560 county and district cadres participating in the establishment of cooperatives. The Rural Work Department of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China sent special personnel to conduct in-depth investigations and summarized the successful experience of the district cadres of the Eighth District of Jiaohe County in learning and piloting agricultural production cooperatives. Rehe Province has completed the preparatory work for the establishment of new agricultural production cooperatives. Responsible cadres of Party committees at all levels have personally participated in this work. Wang Guoquan, Secretary of the Rehe Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the county party secretaries of various counties have given lectures to the training class for cadres who will be involved in establishing agricultural production cooperatives. In the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives, a new situation of leadership attaching importance to it, party members and cadres being active, and the masses being enthusiastic has generally emerged, providing favorable conditions for the smooth completion of the establishment of cooperatives.

The development of agricultural production cooperatives in rural Northeast China has a strong foundation of mutual aid and cooperation, and has accumulated preliminary experience in running cooperatives. After the land reform, the leading organs of the Party in Northeast China resolutely guided the peasants to organize themselves and developed various types of mutual aid teams, which became the main economic form of organizing production in rural areas. On this basis, the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China implemented the principle of active leadership, steady progress, and gradual trial of agricultural production cooperatives. The work of county-level pilot agricultural production cooperatives which started in 1952 also achieved great success. In 1952, 817 agricultural production cooperatives were piloted by counties in Northeast China, with an average of four to five pilots per county. These cooperatives generally showed great superiority in terms of increasing production and increasing income. However, due to lack of experience, there was a phenomenon of "greed for more and bigger" for a time; in terms of production management methods and management work, the shortcomings of "a large stall, a shallow base, and a lot of debt" occurred. These shortcomings were promptly corrected and resolved. Therefore, the achievements of the pilot agricultural production cooperatives have had a very good impact on the masses. In the winter of 1952, the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a rural work conference to comprehensively and systematically summarize the work of running cooperatives, and based on one year's experience in running cooperatives, formulated the "Provisional Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives", which became the basis and guide for the continued development of agricultural production cooperatives in 1953 and in the future. On this basis, 4,043 agricultural production cooperatives were piloted at the district level in 1953, with an average of two and a half cooperatives per district. Because various places have accepted the experience of running cooperatives in 1952, the work of running cooperatives has improved, and the scope of influence of agricultural production cooperatives has also been further expanded. In this way, agricultural production cooperatives have become a huge force in Northeast China to drive mutual aid teams forward and attract individual farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

    东北今春将建立七千多个农业生产合作社
    【新华社沈阳四日电】东北区各地农村经过深入、广泛、全面地进行国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传教育后，大大提高了农民参加互助合作组织的积极性。目前，各地党政领导机关已开始着手进行一九五四年新建农业生产合作社的准备工作。根据现有条件和农民的要求，全区初步计划在一九五四年春季建立七千七百个农业生产合作社，比全区现有的农业生产合作社总数增加一倍半左右。为做好建社工作，各省已相继开始训练建社干部和进行建社试点工作，并总结一九五三年区级办社的经验。黑龙江省已有二十八个县完成建社试点工作，其中有十一个县训练了五百六十多名参加建社的县、区干部。中共吉林省委农村工作部派专人深入调查和总结了蛟河县第八区区干部学习试办农业生产合作社的成功经验。热河省已完成了新建农业生产合作社的准备工作，中共各级党委的负责干部都亲自参加这一工作，中共热河省委员会书记王国权和各县县委书记都为建社干部训练班上课。各地在建社准备工作中，普遍出现了领导重视，党员干部积极，群众热情高涨的新情况，为顺利完成建社工作提供了有利条件。
    东北农村发展农业生产合作社，有较强的互助合作基础，并已积累了办社的初步经验。土地改革后，东北党的领导机关即坚决引导农民组织起来，发展了各种类型的互助组，成为农村组织生产的主要经济形式；在此基础上，中共中央东北局贯彻积极领导，稳步前进，逐级试办农业生产合作社的方针，从一九五二年开始县级试办农业生产合作社的工作也取得了很大的成绩。一九五二年，东北全区由县试办的农业生产合作社八百一十七个，平均每县试办了四个到五个，这些合作社一般在增加生产和增加收入方面，都显示了很大的优越性。但由于缺乏经验，曾一度发生过“贪多贪大”的现象；在生产的经营方法和管理工作上曾发生过“摊子大、底子空、债务多”的缺点。这些缺点，都及时得到了纠正和解决。因此，试办农业生产合作社的成绩在群众中影响很好。一九五二年冬，中共中央东北局召开农村工作会议，对办社工作进行了全面和系统的总结，并根据一年办社的经验，制定了“农业生产合作社试行章程”，成为一九五三年与今后继续发展农业生产合作社的依据和指针。在这样的基础上，一九五三年开始由区级试办了四千零四十三个农业生产合作社，平均每个区有两个半社。各地由于接受了一九五二年的办社经验，办社工作都有进步，农业生产合作社的影响范围也更加扩大了。这样，农业生产合作社已成为东北区带动互助组前进和吸引个体农民参加互助合作组织的巨大力量。
