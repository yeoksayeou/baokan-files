The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Instructions on Organizing Worker Delegations to Visit and Celebrate with Rural Areas During the Spring Festival

In order to better conduct education on consolidating the worker-peasant alliance among workers and peasants, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued "Instructions on Conducting Worker-Peasant Alliance Education and Organizing Worker-Peasant Celebrations During the Spring Festival."

The worker-peasant alliance, led by the working class, is the foundation of our country's people's democratic dictatorship, an inexhaustible source of revolutionary power, and a guarantee of victory on all fronts. In the past, we relied on the close unity between workers and peasants to defeat the combined forces of imperialism and domestic reactionary forces and achieve the victory of the New Democratic Revolution. In the future, to build our country into a great socialist industrial power, we will rely even more on the further consolidation and strengthening of the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, making every effort to continue strengthening the worker-peasant alliance is a constant and important task for trade union organizations at all levels.

From May to September 1953, seven cities in North China, including Tangshan and Zhangjiakou, the Fengfeng Mining Area, and four special districts including Cangxian, organized worker condolence delegations to visit the rain-affected rural areas. Trade union organizations in Chongqing in the Southwest, Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Changzhou in East China, and Jinzhou and Dalian in the Northeast, also organized worker delegations to visit nearby rural areas under the leadership of the local Party committees, in order to educate employees on the worker-peasant alliance. After these worker representatives arrived in the rural areas, they were warmly welcomed by the peasants. Through discussions and celebrations, they promoted mutual understanding between workers and peasants and strengthened the relationship between them. This was a good education for both workers and peasants. Experience has proved that consolidating the worker-peasant alliance should not only be reflected in the policies of the Party and the government, but also in the daily lives of workers and peasants. Organizing workers and peasants to visit and celebrate with each other is an effective way to strengthen the worker-peasant relationship and the friendship and unity between workers and peasants.

The Spring Festival of 1954 is approaching. In order to use the Spring Festival to conduct a vivid education on the worker-peasant alliance for the staff and workers (and also for the peasants), the All-China Federation of Trade Unions hopes that trade union organizations at all levels will, in accordance with the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Conducting Worker-Peasant Alliance Education and Organizing Worker-Peasant Celebrations During the Spring Festival," organize worker delegations to visit and celebrate with nearby rural areas under the leadership of local Party committees. When organizing worker delegations to visit rural areas, the following matters should be noted:

(1) Before the worker delegation departs, it should make preparations, draft publicity and visit outlines, and organize short-term study. It is required that through this visit and celebration, workers and peasants will further understand that workers and peasants, industry and agriculture, cities and villages must support each other; the general line of the state during the transition period is completely in line with the interests of workers and peasants; the interests of workers and working peasants are completely consistent; the road of mutual assistance and cooperation is the road to happiness for peasants, and the capitalist road cannot free peasants from poverty. It is required that these principles be clearly explained through visits and celebrations, and the members of the worker delegation should first understand these principles.

(2) The worker delegation should be led by responsible cadres, with labor models and activists as the backbone, and absorb general staff and workers to participate, and bring along movies, pictures, cultural troupes (worker amateur cultural troupes or invite local professional cultural troupes to participate), doctors, etc., as much as possible. After the delegation arrives in the rural areas, it can conduct visits through family visits and organizing various forums (such as forums for cadres, labor models, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, cooperatives, mutual aid groups, women, etc.). The movies and cultural troupes brought by the delegation should select films and programs that are simple, easy to understand, and educational for peasants to show and perform. It is best for doctors to include gynecologists and pediatricians. The delegation should also organize small-scale picture exhibitions for peasants as much as possible, so that peasants can see the faces of industrial production, worker life, and the country's economic construction.

(3) Forums should be lively, active, and full of intimate and united atmosphere, with participants talking freely. At the forums, workers and peasants can introduce each other to the conditions of industrial and agricultural production and the lives of workers and peasants. The description of worker life should focus on the collectivity, discipline, tension, and accuracy of life, and should not exaggerate the affluence of life, in order to eliminate the estrangement and some misunderstandings between workers and peasants and achieve further understanding and unity. At the forums or celebrations, the delegation should express its gratitude to the peasants for supporting industrial construction with grain and industrial raw materials.

(4) The worker delegation should be very disciplined and very polite. Clothing should be simple and the delegation's own actions should conform to the identity of representatives of the working class, using this model action to influence peasants. Arrogance, disrespect for peasants, and other remarks and actions that may cause resentment among peasants must be prevented and corrected in a timely manner, and should be criticized afterwards.

(5) Before the delegation departs, it should request the local Party committee and government to notify the Party organizations and government agencies in the counties, districts, and townships that the delegation will visit in advance. The delegation should bring its own food and should not increase the trouble of reception for the peasants.

(6) Trade union organizations at all levels should report the situation and experience of organizing worker delegations to visit and celebrate with rural areas during the Spring Festival to local newspapers in a timely manner, and should also report to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

### 全国总工会关于春节期间组织工人代表团到农村进行慰问与联欢的指示

    全国总工会关于春节期间组织工人代表团到农村进行慰问与联欢的指示
    为了在工人和农民中间更好地进行巩固工农联盟的教育，中共中央已经发出了“关于在春节期间进行工农联盟教育和组织工农联欢的指示”。
    以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟，是我国人民民主专政的基础，是革命力量用之不竭的源泉，是一切战线上的胜利保障。在过去，我们依靠工农之间的亲密团结，战胜了帝国主义与国内反动势力的联合力量，取得了新民主主义革命的胜利；在今后，要把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业国，则更有赖于工农联盟的进一步巩固与加强。因此，尽一切努力来继续加强工农联盟，乃是工会各级组织的一个经常的重要任务。
    一九五三年五至九月间，华北区的唐山、张家口等七个城市，峰峰矿区及沧县等四个专区，都先后组织了工人慰问团，深入雨涝的农村进行了慰问；西南区的重庆，华东区的上海、无锡、苏州和常州，东北区的锦州、大连等地的工会组织，为了对职工进行工农联盟的教育，也都在当地党委的领导下组织工人代表团访问了附近的农村。这些工人代表到达农村以后，受到农民的热烈欢迎，经过座谈、联欢，促进了工农群众之间的相互了解，密切了工农群众之间的关系。这对于工人和农民都是一个很好的教育。经验证明：巩固工农联盟不但应该表现在党和政府的政策方面，也应该表现在工人群众和农民群众的日常生活方面，而组织工人和农民互相访问和联欢，乃是密切工农关系、加强工人与农民群众之间的友谊团结的一种有效形式。
    一九五四年的春节即将到来，为了利用春节期间向职工群众（同时也是对于农民群众）进行一次生动的工农联盟的教育，全国总工会希望工会各级组织遵照“中共中央关于在春节期间进行工农联盟教育和组织工农联欢的指示”的规定，在各地党委领导下，组织工人代表团分赴附近农村进行慰问与联欢。在组织工人代表团去农村慰问时，应切实注意下列事项：
    （一）工人代表团在出发前，应做好准备工作，拟好宣传、访问大纲，组织短期学习。要求经过这一访问和联欢，使工人和农民进一步懂得：工人和农民、工业和农业、城市和乡村必须互相支援；国家过渡时期的总路线是完全符合工农利益的；工人和劳动农民的利益是完全一致的；互助合作的道路才是农民的幸福之路，而资本主义道路是不能使农民摆脱穷困的。要求经过访问和联欢讲清这些道理，工人代表团的团员们则首先应该懂得这些道理。
    （二）工人代表团应由负责干部领导，以劳动模范和积极分子为骨干，吸收一般职工参加，并尽可能携带电影、图片、文工团（工人业余文工团或邀请当地专业文工团参加）、医生等。代表团到达农村后，可以采取家庭访问和组织各种座谈会（如干部、劳动模范、军烈属、合作社、互助组、妇女等座谈会），进行慰问。代表团所携带的电影、文工团，应选择简明易懂又富有教育意义的影片与节目，为农民放映与演出。医生中最好有妇科和小儿科医生参加。代表团并应尽可能为农民组织小型的图片展览会，借以使农民看到工业生产、工人生活以及祖国经济建设的面貌。
    （三）座谈会要做到生动、活泼、互相畅谈，充满亲密团结的气氛。在座谈会上，可以互相介绍工、农业生产和工人与农民生活的情况，对于工人生活的描述，应着重生活中的集体性、纪律性和紧张准确，不要夸张生活的优裕，以消除工农之间的隔阂和某些误解，达到进一步的了解与团结。在座谈会或联欢会上，对于农民以粮食和工业原料支援工业建设，代表团应表示感谢。
      （四）工人代表团要很有纪律，很有礼貌。衣着力求朴素，代表团本身的行动，应该符合于工人阶级的代表的身份，以这种模范的行动来影响农民。对于那种傲慢不恭、不尊重农民以及其他足以引起农民反感的言论和行动，必须予以防止和及时的纠正，事后还应予以批判。
    （五）代表团出发之前，应请求当地的党委和政府，事先通知代表团将去访问的县、区、乡的党组织和政府机关。代表团应自带伙食，不要给农民增加招待的麻烦。
    （六）工会各级组织，应将春节期间组织工人代表团到农村慰问与联欢的情况与经验，及时向当地报纸报道，并应报告中华全国总工会。
