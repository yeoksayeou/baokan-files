　　Rural Demobilized and Transferred Soldiers Should Play an Exemplary Role in Agricultural Production and Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
　　——Reader Letters and Commentary
　　Yang Zhuozhi
    Our newspaper often receives letters from readers reflecting the exemplary deeds of demobilized and transferred soldiers in various regions after returning to their hometowns, in agricultural production, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and other tasks. However, some readers' letters also reflect that a small number of demobilized and transferred soldiers are still unable to settle down to agricultural production, and some even blindly go out to find work. The reason for this situation is mainly that these demobilized and transferred soldiers lack confidence in actively engaging in agricultural production, and some even have the mistaken idea of ​​despising agricultural production. For example, Mei Zhongxing, a demobilized soldier who returned to his hometown in Xincai County, Henan Province, said in a letter that agricultural production requires certain skills and he cannot do it well. After Wei Caibiao returned to his hometown in Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, the local government allocated land and housing to him, but he was unwilling to engage in agricultural production and blindly went out to wander. Mao Huaian of Xingning County, Guangdong Province, emphasized that he would not farm and blindly went to Guangzhou to find work, which led to difficulties in his life. In addition, the failure of individual local people's governments to properly resettle demobilized and transferred soldiers and help them solve the difficulties in production and life has also prompted some demobilized and transferred soldiers to have ideas of not being content with agricultural production. For example, Qi Fengxiang of Jianping County, Hebei Province, Wang Zhongxing of Anci County, Zhang Guiqiu of Ningbo County, Zhejiang Province, and Zhang Detang of Dingtao County, Shandong Province, all reflected in their letters that they did not receive appropriate housing or land after returning to their hometowns, which led to difficulties in their lives. Although the above-mentioned situation of demobilized and transferred soldiers not being content with agricultural production only occurs in a small number of people, it has already made it impossible for them to produce self-sufficiently and establish family affairs, and has also created some bad political influences, so it must be resolved.
    First of all, every demobilized and transferred soldier should recognize that they have received education from the People's Army and have been tempered by the revolutionary war. Generally, they have a higher level of political awareness and have made different degrees of contribution to the people. Now, because of the development of the revolutionary situation and the needs of national construction, they are returning home to produce. The country cares about them and the people respect them. Therefore, they should carry forward the fine traditions of revolutionary soldiers, actively participate in agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and become exemplary advanced figures in implementing the policies of the Party and the People's Government and leading the masses forward. In this way, they can create their own happy life through labor; and they can also gain the support of the masses and strive for greater glory. In this regard, a prominent example is that Gou Peifang, a demobilized soldier in Quzhai Village, Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, actively did a good job in the local Party branch after returning to his hometown, and made 80% of the farmers in the village participate in mutual aid groups under the leadership of the Party members, thus receiving commendation from the higher authorities and the love of the people. The branch he led became a model branch in the province, and he was elected as the director of the agricultural production cooperative. Readers also reflected in their letters that after Zhang Rendong of Ya'an County, Xikang Province, returned to his hometown, he participated in the mutual aid group and assisted the rural government in its work. He won the support of the masses and was elected as a people's representative of the township in the general election. After Xiao Yan of Shangrao County, Jiangxi Province, returned to his hometown, he worked actively and was elected as the township head by the masses, and was later promoted to deputy district head. There are many such examples. Every demobilized and transferred soldier should learn this revolutionary spirit, overcome all erroneous ideas of arrogance and complacency, and strive to make greater contributions to the country and the people.
    Secondly, demobilized and transferred soldiers should understand the importance of agricultural production and its bright future. In order to achieve the country's socialist industrialization and gradually transition our motherland to socialism, it is necessary to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, and change the current scattered and backward small-scale peasant economy into large-scale, advanced collective agriculture, in order to produce more grain and industrial raw materials to supply the needs of industry. Under the leadership and help of industry, agriculture can gradually use new technologies, new agricultural tools or tractors, and production can be rapidly improved, and farmers can live a happy life of common prosperity. Therefore, after returning to their hometowns, demobilized and transferred soldiers, under the leadership of the Party, lead the masses to participate in mutual aid and cooperation and do a good job in agricultural production, which is to work hard to implement the general line of the country during the transition period and build socialism. This work is important, glorious, and the future is bright. As for some temporary difficulties in production and life at present, as long as they work actively, learn humbly from the masses, they will gradually be overcome with the care and help of the People's Government and the masses. For example, Yang Youzhi (a Communist Party member), a transferred soldier from Xingan County, Jiangxi Province, was originally unfamiliar with agricultural labor. Because he studied humbly and worked hard, and participated in the mutual aid group, his fields were harvested abundantly and he became the household with the largest increase in production in the group. After Dong Shouqian, a transferred soldier from Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province, returned to his hometown, he participated in the mutual aid group and worked actively. He lived a good life and sold more than 5,000 jin of grain to the state last year.
    In order to make all demobilized and transferred soldiers content with agricultural production and become an active force of the Party in rural work, local people's governments must do a good job in resettlement work. It should be recognized that because revolutionary soldiers shed blood and sacrificed on the front line, we can produce with peace of mind in the rear. They should be respected and loved when they are transferred back to their hometowns; moreover, doing a good job in resettlement will greatly help all aspects of work. Resettling demobilized and transferred soldiers is a complex and meticulous task. On the one hand, we need to care about them regularly and help them solve the difficulties in production and life, so that they can all be in the right place. On the other hand, we should not regard this work as mere material relief, but must combine production and absorb them into rural work and various political and production organizations to strengthen production construction and political power construction; and regularly educate them so that they can play an exemplary leading role among the masses. Gao Mi County, Shandong Province, has made relatively proper arrangements for demobilized and transferred soldiers, and hundreds of transferred soldiers with various model actions have emerged. Nearly half of the transferred soldiers in the eight counties of Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province, have participated in mutual aid groups and played a backbone role in the groups. Anyang County, Henan Province, convened a county-wide representative meeting of revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, and conducted a study of the general line, which raised the thinking of the representatives a step further. The practices reflected in the above-mentioned readers' letters are all worthy of reference by various regions.

　　农村复员转业军人应该在农业生产和互助合作运动中起模范作用
　　——读者来信述评
  　杨卓之
    本报经常收到不少读者来信，反映各地复员转业军人回乡后，在农业生产、互助合作运动以及其它各项工作中的模范事迹。但是，也有一些读者来信反映：少数复员转业军人还不能安心农业生产，有的甚至盲目外出找工作。产生这种情况的原因，主要是这些复员转业军人缺乏积极搞好农业生产的信心，有的还有着轻视农业生产的错误思想。例如：河南省新蔡县回乡转业军人梅中兴就来信说，农业生产要有一定技术，他做不好。浙江省余姚县魏才标回乡后，当地政府分给他土地房屋，但他不愿从事农业生产，盲目外出流浪。广东省兴宁县毛怀安强调自己不会种田，盲目到广州找工作，以致生活发生困难。此外，个别地方的人民政府对复员转业军人没有妥善安置，帮助他们解决生产、生活中的困难，也促使某些复员转业军人产生了不安心农业生产的思想。如河北省建屏县齐凤祥、安次县王仲兴、浙江省宁波县张桂秋、山东省定陶县张德堂等在来信中都反映：他们回乡后没有分配到适当的房屋或土地，以致生活发生困难。上述复员转业军人不安心农业生产的情况，虽然仅仅出现在少数人的身上，但已经使他们自己不能很好地生产自给，建立家务，并且造成一些不好的政治影响，因此必须加以解决。
    首先，每一个复员转业军人应该认识，自己曾受过人民军队的教育和革命战争的锻炼，一般政治觉悟较高，并且对人民有了程度不同的贡献。现在因为革命形势的发展和国家建设的需要而回家生产，国家对他们是关心的，人民对他们也是尊敬的。因此，应该发扬革命军人的优良传统，积极参加农业生产和互助合作运动，成为贯彻党和人民政府各项政策和带动群众前进的模范先进人物。这样，他们就能用劳动创造自己的美满生活；而且也得到群众的拥护，争取更大的光荣。在这方面，比较突出的例子如：山西省长治县璩寨村复员军人苟佩芳回乡后积极做好当地党的支部工作，并使全村百分之八十的农户在党员的带动下参加了互助组，因而得到了上级的表扬和人民的爱戴。他所领导的支部成为全省模范支部，他并被选为农业生产合作社的主任。读者在来信中也反映了：西康省雅安县张仁栋回乡后参加了互助组，并协助乡村政府工作，得到群众的拥护，在普选中被选为乡人民代表。江西省上饶县萧炎回乡后工作积极，被群众选为乡长，后又被提拔为副区长。这种例子是很多的。每一个复员转业军人都应该学习这种革命精神，克服一切居功自傲、贪逸恶劳的错误思想，努力争取对国家、对人民作更大的贡献。
    其次，复员转业军人应该了解农业生产的重要性和它的光明前途。为了国家的社会主义工业化，使我们祖国逐步过渡到社会主义，必须对农业进行社会主义的改造，把目前分散、落后的小农经济改变为大规模的、先进的集体农业，以生产更多的粮食和工业原料，供给工业的需要。在工业的领导和帮助下，农业就可以逐步使用新技术、新式农具或拖拉机，生产也就能迅速提高，农民也就能过着大家富裕的幸福生活。因此，复员转业军人回乡后在党的领导下，带动群众参加互助合作，搞好农业生产，就是为贯彻国家过渡时期总路线、建设社会主义而努力，这个工作是重要的、光荣的，前途是光明的。至于目前生产、生活上的某些暂时的困难，只要自己积极努力，虚心地向群众学习，是会在人民政府和群众的关怀和帮助下，逐渐克服的。例如：江西省新淦县转业军人杨有志（共产党员）原来不熟悉农业劳动，由于他虚心学习、刻苦钻研，并参加了互助组，所以田地得到了丰收，成为全组增产最多的一户。山西省襄垣县转业军人董守谦回乡后参加了互助组，积极劳动，生活过得挺好，去年还把五千多斤粮食卖给国家。
    要使所有复员转业军人安心于农业生产，并成为党在农村工作中的积极力量，各地人民政府必须做好安置工作。应当认识：由于革命军人在前线流血牺牲，我们才能在后方安心生产，他们转业回乡，应当受到我们的尊敬与爱护；而且，把安置工作做好了，对各方面工作都会有很大的帮助。安置复员转业军人是一件复杂、细致的工作。一方面，需要经常关心他们，帮助他们解决生产、生活中的困难，使他们各得其所。另一方面，也不应该把这个工作看作单纯的物质救济，必须结合生产吸收他们参加农村工作及各种政治组织和生产组织，以加强生产建设与政权建设；并经常对他们进行教育，使他们在群众中起模范带头作用。山东省高密县对复员转业军人作了比较妥善的安置，就涌现了数以百计的有各种模范行动的转业军人。山西省运城专区八个县的转业军人有将近半数参加了互助组，并在组内起了骨干作用。河南省安阳县召开全县烈、军属和复员转业军人代表会议，进行了总路线的学习，把代表们的思想提高了一步。上述读者来信所反映的做法，都是值得各地参考的。
