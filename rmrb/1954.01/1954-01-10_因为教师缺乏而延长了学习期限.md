    Extending the Study Period Due to Lack of Teachers
    A letter from Xue Zhijie, a student at the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School attached to the Beijing Institute of Technology: The problem of insufficient teachers in our school has not been resolved for a long time, which seriously affects the teaching work. Our first batch of students should have graduated in the summer of 1953, but as a result, the study period was extended by one year. Currently, our liberal arts classes still have not adequately resolved the issue of teachers for the two main courses, Foreign History and Politics. The Foreign History course was newly opened after the winter vacation of 1952. At that time, because there was no teacher, a Chinese language teacher from our school volunteered to take on the task. This teacher is not familiar with foreign history and can only read the textbook sentence by sentence in class, with very little explanation. As a result, students are unclear about many issues. The teaching progress is also very slow. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education, there should be two classes per week, completing ancient and medieval history in one semester. Because we are an extended class with more time, we have four classes per week, but last semester we only completed half of the original plan. After the start of this semester, no foreign history teacher has been assigned, so we are not learning much, just like last semester.
    In the past, there were also no teachers for the Politics course, and students in the liberal arts and engineering classes attended large classes together. The school does not pay enough attention to our learning because the students in the liberal arts classes will not be students of the engineering institute in the future. The liberal arts classes have four politics classes per week, only two of which are combined with the engineering classes, and the other two are changed to self-study. Moreover, the politics classes are taught very poorly, and some places are even explained incorrectly.
    Our study period has already been extended by one year. Judging from the current situation, if the teachers for the two main courses of Foreign History and Politics cannot be well resolved, it is still questionable whether we will be able to graduate by then. We anxiously hope that the leading organs will help us solve this problem.

### 因为教师缺乏而延长了学习期限

    因为教师缺乏而延长了学习期限
    北京工业学院附设工农速成中学学生薛志杰来信：我校教师不足问题长期没有得到解决，严重地影响了教学工作。我们第一批入学的学生原应在一九五三年暑假毕业，结果就因此延长学习期限一年。现在我们文科班的外国历史和政治课两门主课的教师还未能很好解决。外国历史课是一九五二年寒假后新开的，当时因为没有教员，就由我校一位语文教师自愿担任下来。这位老师对外国历史不熟悉，上课时只能照着课本一句句读下去，很少解释，因此同学们对很多问题都搞不清楚。教学进度也很慢，按中央高等教育部规定，每周二堂，一个学期讲完古代史和中世史；因为我们是延长班，时间较富裕，所以每周讲四堂，上学期只讲完了原计划的二分之一。这学期开始后仍旧没有配备外国历史的教师，因此我们也就和上学期一样学不到什么东西。
    政治课过去也没有教员，文科班与工科班的同学在一起上大课。学校因为我们文科班的同学将来不是工学院的学生，对我们的学习不够重视。文科班每周四堂政治课，只与工科班合上二堂，另外二堂改为自习。而且政治课讲得又很差，有的地方甚至讲解错误。
    我们学习期限已经延长了一年。照目前情况看，如果外国历史与政治两门主课的教师不能得到很好解决，我们到那时能否毕业还是问题。我们焦急地盼望领导机关帮助我们解决这个问题。
