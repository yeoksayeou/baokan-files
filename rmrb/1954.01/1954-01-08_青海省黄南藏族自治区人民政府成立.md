A total of 162 representatives from Tibetan, Han, Hui, and Salar ethnic groups attended the conference, including 116 Tibetan representatives.

The conference exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress. After thorough discussion, Xia Ricang (Tibetan) was elected as Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, and Du Hua'an (Han), Sai Chi (Tibetan), Gele Jiacuo (Tibetan), Zha Xi (Tibetan), Xiang Qian (Tibetan), and Wa Jia (Tibetan) were elected as Vice Chairmen. Gou Jicang (Tibetan), Ma Yuqing (Hui), and 21 others were elected as government members. At the meeting, the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Region Consultative Committee was also established, with Guo Tingpan (Han) elected as Chairman, Duoriji (Tibetan), Chen Le (Tibetan), Jiumei Suonanmu (Tibetan), and Ma Junde (Hui) as Vice Chairmen, and Jiumei Xirao (Tibetan) and 30 others as members. The meeting also elected representatives to attend the Provincial People's Congress.

At the meeting, Du Hua'an, Vice Chairman of the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government, delivered a report on "The Work Overview and Future Tasks Since the Liberation of the Huangnan Tibetan Region." He pointed out that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the higher-level People's Government, various tasks in the Huangnan Tibetan Region have achieved great success. Since liberation, more than 4,000 large and small disputes among various ethnic groups and tribes have been mediated throughout the region, and 261 minority cadres have been trained. The total number of livestock in the region has increased from 378,000 to more than 663,000. He said that the people of all ethnic groups in the region should further strengthen unity among and within ethnic groups, continue to enrich and improve the ethnic regional autonomous regime, and strive to develop the autonomous region's political, economic, cultural and other construction undertakings. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed with this report and put forward more than 20 proposals related to political power, economic construction, and social security. Finally, Xia Ricang gave a concluding report. He called on all representatives to widely and deeply convey the spirit of the conference to the people of all ethnic groups in the region, and to mobilize and organize the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region to strive for the implementation of the conference resolutions and the construction of a new Huangnan. The meeting also adopted a telegram of tribute to Chairman Mao and the Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government.

Note: The Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Region is equivalent to a special district level and governs Tongren, Jianzha, and Zeku counties. The autonomous region borders the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region to the east, the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province to the north, the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region to the northwest, and the Henan Mongolian Autonomous Banner to the southwest. The total population of the region is approximately 72,000, including Tibetan, Hui, Han, and Salar ethnic groups, of which Tibetans account for more than 88 percent. Except for a small area of agricultural and pastoral intermingling, the rest of the region is pastoral. The autonomous region produces wool, animal skins, and medicinal materials such as deer antler and musk. Before liberation, the entire region suffered from the cruel oppression of reactionary rulers, livestock production was severely damaged, and many disputes were left between ethnic groups. After liberation, the People's Government resolutely implemented ethnic policies, united the local masses and leaders who had contact with the people, thoroughly shattered the imperialist and Kuomintang remnants' conspiracy to instigate counter-revolutionary rebellions in the Jianzha area, mediated disputes between various tribes, and led the people of all ethnic groups to develop animal husbandry and agricultural production, and carry out cultural, educational, and health work. The lives of the people of all ethnic groups have been preliminarily improved.

    青海省黄南藏族自治区人民政府成立
    【新华社西宁七日电】青海省黄南藏族自治区首届人民代表会议，在一九五三年十二月十四日到二十二日于同仁县隆务市举行。出席大会的有藏、汉、回、撒拉等民族的代表一百六十二人，其中藏族代表一百一十六人。
    会议代行人民代表大会职权，经过充分讨论，选出夏日仓（藏族）为自治区人民政府主席，杜华安（汉族）、赛池（藏族）、格勒嘉错（藏族）、扎喜（藏族）、项谦（藏族）、哇加（藏族）为副主席，苟吉仓（藏族）、马玉庆（回族）等二十三人为政府委员。会上并成立了黄南藏族自治区协商委员会，选出郭廷潘（汉族）为主席，多日吉（藏族）、陈勒（藏族）、九美索南木（藏族）、马俊德（回族）为副主席，九美喜饶（藏族）等三十一人为委员。会议还选出了出席省人民代表大会的代表。
    会上，黄南藏族自治区人民政府副主席杜华安作了“黄南藏区解放以来的工作概况及今后任务”的报告。他指出：黄南藏区在中国共产党和上级人民政府的领导下，各项工作已获得很大成就。解放以来，全区调解了各民族和各部落之间的大小纠纷四千多件，培养少数民族干部二百六十一名。全区各种牲畜由三十七万八千头增加到六十六万三千多头。他说：全区各族人民要进一步加强民族间和民族内部的团结，继续充实和健全民族区域自治政权，努力发展自治区的政治、经济、文化等各项建设事业。到会代表一致同意这一报告，并提出有关政权、经济建设和社会治安等提案二十多件。最后，夏日仓作总结报告。他号召全体代表把大会精神广泛深入地传达到全区各族人民群众中去，并要动员和组织自治区的各族人民为贯彻执行大会决议和建设新黄南而奋斗。会议并通过向毛主席和青海省人民政府主席、副主席致敬的电文。
    按：黄南藏族自治区相当于专区级，辖同仁、尖扎、泽库三县，自治区东面和甘南藏族自治区接壤，北面和青海省农业区相连，西北和海南藏族自治区、西南和河南蒙旗区交界，全区人口约七万二千多人，包括藏、回、汉、撒拉等民族，其中藏族占百分之八十八以上。全区除有一小部分农牧交错区外，其余都是牧业区。自治区出产羊毛、兽皮，和鹿茸、麝香等药材。解放前，全区遭受反动统治者的残酷压迫，畜牧业生产被严重破坏，并使各民族间留下许多纠纷。解放后，人民政府坚决执行民族政策，团结了当地群众和与人民有联系的领袖人物，彻底粉碎了帝国主义和国民党残匪妄图在尖扎地区策动反革命叛乱的阴谋，调解了各部落的纠纷，并领导各族人民发展牧业、农业生产，开展文教卫生工作，各族人民的生活已初步得到改善。
