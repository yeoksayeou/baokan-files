Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd. The First Automobile Works will begin partial production in 1954, and preparations are actively underway.

1954 is a decisive year for the construction of the First Automobile Works. The construction project is complex and the tasks are arduous, but partial production must also begin simultaneously. According to the established plan, in 1954, in addition to producing a batch of equipment and tools necessary for future formal production to support the construction project, the factory should also trial-produce some automobile parts and make some production adjustments during the trial-production process to make the process arrangement and labor organization more reasonable. This year, twenty-four workshops will be put into production one after another, including those belonging to auxiliary production, basic production, and power sections. According to this requirement, starting from the second quarter of this year, a 3,000-person installation team from Central South and East China will be put into intense labor to install dozens of machines. To welcome this year's production, the preparatory organizations for five workshops have been established, and technical teams for several workshops have been formed. Workers are stepping up their studies of Soviet design drawings and delving into the production business of each workshop.

People are busy preparing for the start of partial production. The drafting staff of the Technical Department has reproduced the first batch of equipment drawings and are rushing to translate the second batch. The Northeast Film Studio translated and produced several copies of automobile structure principle films, each 64,000 meters long, in advance for the factory, so that the factory's employees can obtain complete business teaching materials in a timely manner. The cultivation of technical forces is also being carried out in a planned manner. As early as the beginning of last year, the factory sent more than 2,000 apprentices and students to more than 40 factories in major cities across the country for training, and selected a group of cadres to study factory management, accounting statistics and other majors at the People's University of China in Beijing, the Northeast University of Finance and Economics, and the Changchun Accounting College. The factory also runs an automobile technician school and an automobile manufacturing school. It is expected that within two or three years, a large number of intermediate technical cadres and various skilled workers will grow rapidly.

    第一汽车制造厂今年将开始部分生产
    【新华社沈阳三日电】第一汽车制造厂在一九五四年将开始部分生产，目前正在积极进行准备。
    一九五四年是第一汽车制造厂建厂有决定性的一年，建设工程很复杂，任务很繁重，而同时要开始部分生产。按已定计划，这个厂在一九五四年除应配合建设工程生产一批为将来正式生产所必需的设备和工具外，还要试制一部分汽车部件，并在试制过程中进行一些生产上的调整，使得工序排列、劳动组织等更加合理。今年将有二十四个车间要先后投入生产，其中包括属于辅助生产部分的，属于基本生产部分的，和属于动力部分的。根据这一要求，从今年第二季度起，将有来自中南、华东各地的三千人的安装队投入紧张的劳动，把几十台机器安装起来。为迎接今年生产，现已建立了五个车间的筹备组织，并组成了若干车间的技术小组。职工们正加紧学习苏联的设计图纸和钻研各该车间的生产业务。
    人们正为准备开始部分生产而忙碌着。技术处制图人员已翻制好第一批设备图纸，并正赶译第二批图纸。东北电影制片厂提前为这个厂译制好每套长六万四千公尺的汽车构造原理电影拷贝若干套，使这个厂的职工及时得到完善的业务教材。技术力量的培养也已有计划地进行，早在去年年初，这个厂就送出二千多名徒工和学生，委托全国各大城市四十多个工厂训练，并选派一批干部到北京人民大学、东北财经学院、长春会计专科学校学习工厂管理、会计统计等专业。这个厂还举办了汽车技工学校、汽车制造学校。预计在二、三年内将有大批中级技术干部和各种技术工人迅速成长起来。
