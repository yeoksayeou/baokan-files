Xinhua News Agency Report: The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wugong Village, Raoyang County, Hebei Province, which has the longest history among China's agricultural production cooperatives, held a grand tenth anniversary celebration meeting on December 27th of last year. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and more than 300 agricultural production cooperatives from various counties sent representatives to visit and congratulate them. Many congratulatory messages and letters were sent from various places. The Hebei Provincial People's Government sent a prize banner with six striking characters: "The Flower of Socialism."

At the celebration meeting, Geng Changsuo, the director of the agricultural production cooperative, excitedly reported on the victorious history of the cooperative's ten years of organization. He said, "Ten years ago, our cooperative was just a small sprout that had just emerged from the soil, with only four households, called the 'Land Cooperation Group.' Later, it increased to nine households, nineteen households, twenty-five households; now it is a large cooperative with two hundred and eighty-seven households." After recounting the vivid facts of the cooperative's growth from small to large, from hardship to prosperity, and the improvement of everyone's production and life through cooperation over the past ten years, he said, "Chairman Mao's instructions to organize is the path for farmers to climb higher and higher towards happiness. We must gradually move towards full collectivization of the village along this path." Wang Yin, a female member of the cooperative, then took the stage to speak, using her own experience to confirm what Geng Changsuo said. She said, "My mother-in-law and I are two widows who have no one to take care of us. One is eighty-two years old, and the other is sixty-two years old. In the past, we often couldn't afford to cook, and often filled our stomachs with cold water. Since joining the cooperative, we now have everything we need to eat. In the past, life was about enduring the days, but now life is about catching up with the happy life of Soviet farmers." The third speaker was Zhang Zhensheng, the deputy director of the cooperative and the secretary of the Party branch in the agricultural production cooperative. He reported to all members on the cooperative's production summary for the past year. He said, "This is the first year we have engaged in such large-scale production and managed such a large enterprise. At first, some people were worried that we wouldn't do a good job, but now it has been proven that as long as we work together with one heart and one mind and are determined to move towards socialism, we can overcome any difficulties." He mentioned that last year the cooperative overcame drought followed by floods, solved the problem of organizing and using 428 laborers, achieved planned cultivation on 3,093 mu of land, and also solved the problems of distribution of various incomes and learning and education very well, resulting in an overall increase in land production throughout the cooperative, with an average yield of 318 jin of grain per mu. At this point, the members and guests all smiled happily. Zhang Zhensheng also reported on the shortcomings in operation and management and the methods to overcome them. Finally, another deputy director, Geng Shupu, reported on this year's production increase plan. They will apply more coarse fertilizer and less fine fertilizer this year, reducing fertilizer costs by 79% compared to last year; the average yield per mu will be increased by about 50% compared to last year, so that the total income of the cooperative will reach more than 1,437,500 jin of grain. In addition to the members' food and payment of public grain, they plan to sell 450,000 jin to the state to support the country's industrial construction.

On the second day of the conference, Li Ziguang, representative of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, congratulated all members on behalf of the Provincial Committee and encouraged them to continue to move forward. Subsequently, Chen Zhe, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, announced to all members: In order to help farmers increase production, the state-owned Hebei Province First Agricultural Machine Tractor Station is officially established here today. That afternoon, a tractor plowing performance was held. About ten thousand farmers from dozens of surrounding villages also came to visit.

The guests at the meeting discussed their impressions of the conference and, together with the members, visited the exhibition hall of the ten-year development history of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative, the Soviet collective farm picture exhibition, and the cooperative's oil press, woodworking room, and other various sideline production activities. Geng Changsuo and all members of the cooperative held a warm gathering with the guests. The guests shared their impressions. Xu Laomo, a model agricultural worker from Pengjiazhuang, Jin County, said, "I have found the direction for farmers to move forward here." Bian Yongsheng, representative of the Dongzhuangzi Cooperative Farm in Ninghe County, said, "The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative is the eldest brother of agricultural production cooperatives and a flower of socialism. We must learn from it and let the flowers of socialism bloom all over the Hebei Plain." When the guests said goodbye to all members of the cooperative, everyone agreed to strengthen ties in the future and carry out friendly competitions for increasing grain and industrial raw material production next year.

    耿长锁农业生产合作社建社十年
    全社集会庆祝走互助合作道路的巨大成就
    据新华社讯：我国农业生产合作社中历史最长的河北省饶阳县五公村耿长锁农业生产合作社，在去年十二月二十七日举行了隆重的建社十周年纪念大会。中共河北省委员会、河北省人民政府及各县三百多个农业生产合作社，都派代表前往参观和祝贺。各地送来许多贺词、贺信。河北省人民政府送来的奖旗上写着六个夺目大字：“社会主义之花”。
    纪念会上，农业生产合作社社长耿长锁兴奋地报告了该社组织起来十年的胜利历史。他说：“十年前的冬天，我们的社才是个刚出土的小嫩芽，只有四户，叫‘土地合作组’。后来增到九户，十九户，二十五户；如今是二百八十七户的大社了。”他叙述了十年来该社由小到大、由苦到甜、大家合作生产、生活一起提高的生动事实后说道：“毛主席指示组织起来的道路，就是庄稼人步步登高走向幸福的道路。我们要沿着这条道路逐步走向全村集体化。”该社女社员王银接着登台讲话，她用自己的体验证实耿长锁说的话。她说：“我和我婆母娘是两个无人照顾的寡妇。一个八十二岁，一个六十二岁。过去我们三天两头掀不开锅，常常用凉水灌肚子。自从入了社，现在吃啥有啥了。以前过日子是熬日头，现在过日子是要赶上苏联农民的幸福生活。”第三个讲话的是该社的副社长和农业生产合作社中党的支部书记张振生，他向全体社员报告了该社去年的生产总结。他说：“咱们是头一年搞这么大的生产，管这么大的日子，起初有些人耽心搞不好，现在证明，只要咱们齐心合力，决心走向社会主义，啥困难也能克服。”他谈到去年该社克服了先旱后涝，解决了四百二十八个劳动力的组织使用问题，三千零九十三亩土地达到了计划耕作，各种收益的分配和学习教育问题也得到很好的解决，结果使全社土地全面增产，每亩地平均收了三百一十八斤粮食。说到这里，社员和来宾们都高兴地笑起来。张振生还报告了经营管理中的缺点和克服的方法。最后由另一个副社长耿书普报告了今年的增产计划。他们要在今年多施粗肥，少施细肥，使肥料资金比去年降低百分之七十九；每亩平均产量比去年提高百分之五十左右，使全社总收益达到一百四十三万七千五百多斤粮食，除社员吃用和缴纳公粮外，计划卖给国家四十五万斤，支持国家的工业建设。
    大会第二天，中共河北省委员会代表、中共河北省委员会农村工作部部长李子光代表省委向全体社员祝贺，勉励他们继续前进。随后，河北省人民政府农林厅副厅长陈哲向全体社员宣布：国家为帮助农民提高产量，国营河北省第一农业机器拖拉机站今天在这里正式成立。当天下午，举行了拖拉机耕地表演。周围数十个村约万余农民也前来参观。
    到会来宾座谈了大会观感，并和社员们一道参观了耿长锁农业生产合作社十年发展史、苏联集体农庄图片展览棚和该社的油房、木作房等各种副业生产活动。耿长锁和该社全体社员，和来宾们举行了热烈的联欢。来宾们纷纷畅述自己的观感。晋县彭家庄农业劳动模范许老墨说：“在这里找到了庄稼人前进的方向。”宁河县董庄子合作农庄代表边永生说：“耿长锁农业生产合作社是农业生产合作社的老大哥，是社会主义的鲜花，我们要向它学习，让社会主义的鲜花开遍河北平原。”当来宾们和该社全体社员告别时，大家相约今后要加强联系，并为明年增产粮食和工业原料开展友谊竞赛。
