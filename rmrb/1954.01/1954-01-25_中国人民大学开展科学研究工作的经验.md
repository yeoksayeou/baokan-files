Experiences of Renmin University of China in Carrying Out Scientific Research

Zhang Tengxiao, Deputy Director of the Research Department of Renmin University of China

General Situation of the Development of Scientific Research Work

The scientific research work of Renmin University of China began after the establishment of the school in 1950.

At that time, apart from a few who had some research capabilities, the vast majority of our teachers were young and had no experience in scientific research. Moreover, our teaching staff were unfamiliar with the teaching work of this new type of school, and the teachers lacked a foundation in the courses they taught. Under these circumstances, carrying out scientific research work was bound to encounter many difficulties. However, according to the experience of Soviet universities, scientific research work is an important means of improving teachers and teaching levels. Therefore, under the suggestion and help of Soviet experts, we established a scientific research work system from the very beginning and have adhered to it. Facts have proved that this was completely necessary and correct.

Over the past three years, our scientific research work has been developing gradually. Shortly after the school started in September 1950, we organized the writing of scientific papers in the teaching and research sections. By the time the scientific discussion meeting was held in October, 31 papers had been selected and reported at the university-wide scientific discussion meeting and group meetings. Although these scientific papers had many shortcomings and were generally not of a high standard, it was indeed a good start. Following this, we proposed the establishment of regular scientific research work, requiring teachers to make individual scientific research work plans, teaching and research sections to regularly check the implementation of teachers' individual plans, and to regularly organize small discussion meetings. At the same time, the teaching and research sections also established contact with business departments. In the second semester of the first academic year, we completed more than 120 scientific reports, which increased not only the quantity but also the quality of the papers at the second scientific discussion meeting in 1951. In the third academic year's scientific research work, most teachers systematically studied political theory and professional knowledge, and carried out production practice, occupying certain practical materials, which further combined scientific research with teaching and the actual needs of national construction. In the third scientific discussion meeting, the group meetings of each department were more active. In particular, the report on "Research on the Organization of Rhythmic Production According to the Indicated Charts of the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 3" attracted great attention from various enterprises, especially the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry of the Central People's Government, which believed that the research work could solve the practical problems in their work. This academic year's scientific research work plan has 331 special topics, and started to compile 35 kinds of teaching materials with research nature. We have 399 teachers who have formulated scientific research work plans, including 47 department heads and teaching and research section directors who also participated in scientific research work, formulating 38 special topics. Therefore, our scientific research work, whether in terms of the number of participants, the quantity and quality of papers, or the scope of research, is gradually increasing, improving, and expanding.

However, our scientific research work is advancing on a tortuous road. When we first proposed scientific research work, many teachers believed that this was a premature requirement, on the grounds that they had not yet mastered theory and professional knowledge. However, since our requirements were lower at the beginning, coupled with the specific help of Soviet experts (such as indicating the direction of research, drafting paper outlines, etc.), this broke some teachers' fear of conducting scientific research. However, as teachers improved in theory and professional knowledge, scientific papers could not remain at the original level, so many teachers felt a sense of inadequacy. They were not satisfied with the papers they had written, and others were more critical than encouraging. In addition, the teaching tasks were heavy, and a certain degree of contradiction occurred between teaching work and scientific research work. Therefore, a few people held a negative attitude towards scientific research work, believing that there were no conditions for engaging in scientific research at present; some even said that proposing scientific research work was "overestimating one's abilities" and "wanting to run before learning to walk"; others said: "Scientific work has become scientific sin." Some teachers, although acknowledging the importance of scientific research work in principle, felt that it was a heavy burden due to heavy teaching tasks, little time, and their low level. This idea had developed to a very serious degree after the third scientific discussion meeting. Obviously, if these ideological problems were not resolved, scientific research work could not move forward. To this end, we have repeatedly emphasized the importance of research work, advocated the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and the specific methods are: putting forward different requirements for different teachers, and emphasizing that, according to our situation, the topics should not be large, and the scope of the problems involved should not be too broad. Some teachers can study certain topics, and some teachers can be temporarily exempted from scientific research tasks. At the same time, we must make everyone realize that scientific undertakings are arduous undertakings, and we cannot demand too much too quickly, and we cannot achieve success overnight. Only through unremitting efforts and giving play to the spirit of tenacity can we gradually see the results of research.

In this way, over the past three years, our scientific research work has achieved certain results. This is mainly because we have cultivated teachers' habits and interests in engaging in scientific research, laying a necessary foundation for further carrying out scientific research work in the future.

Must Combine with Actual Needs

"Linking teaching with practice, combining Soviet experience with China's situation" is our guiding principle for teaching work, and also our guiding principle for scientific research work. Renmin University of China has inherited the fine tradition of revolutionary education in the old liberated areas, which combines theory with practice. Therefore, the bourgeois phenomena of "academic for the sake of academic" and "science for the sake of science" do not exist in scientific research. On the whole, the problems we study are closely related to the needs of revolution and construction. Of course, not all of the problems we have studied have been done well. In the past, many of our scientific topics were not drawn from a large amount of material according to actual needs, but were imagined. Therefore, the topics were often very large and involved a wide range. In addition, we could not deeply understand the actual situation and occupy a large amount of material, so we could only repeat or almost repeat well-known truths. There were no and could not be any new opinions; thus, it was destined that such papers would be divorced from reality and therefore a failure. On the contrary, some of our scientific topics, either practical problems felt in teaching, or experiences gained in the process of learning Soviet experience, or based on the actual needs of certain aspects of national construction, and at the same time, in the research process, we can delve into practical materials, the so-called "return to practical research", such research can solve problems, and even if it cannot be solved, it can put forward more valuable opinions. For example, the above-mentioned article "Research on the Organization of Rhythmic Production According to the Indicated Charts of the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 3" was written after studying a large amount of practical material. For this topic, the author began to collect relevant materials when he was doing production practice in the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 3. In the initial research process, he felt that the materials were insufficient and many places could not be judged. Therefore, he went to the factory again to conduct actual investigations, collected materials through various methods, and after further in-depth analysis and research, he wrote the relatively successful paper.

The process of scientific research combining with actual needs is a gradually developing process from low to high and from partial to comprehensive. We cannot demand too much too quickly. According to our experience, teachers who have not done scientific research work should directly combine with teaching needs and conduct independent special research around the teaching materials, such as teachers who teach "History of International Relations" researching "The Status of China in Modern International Relations," and teachers who teach "Currency Circulation and Credit" researching "Cash Receipts and Disbursements, Credit, and Issuance Business of the People's Bank of China," etc. This can not only improve the quality of teaching but also prevent teachers from feeling that scientific research work is a burden. As teachers improve their theoretical and professional level, they should engage in the research of various special topics in reality in combination with the needs of China's construction, so as to improve their scientific level.

In order to make scientific research work closely combined with practice, we have established close contacts with relevant business departments through various forms, and implemented friendly cooperation in scientific research work. First of all, we must discuss the problems we are studying with relevant departments, so that the problems we are studying can be the actual needs of them and problems that need to be solved urgently. Only in this way will teachers be willing to conduct in-depth research, and business departments can actively help us solve the difficulties in the research process. Some scientific topics of the teaching and research sections of our finance and economics departments were not the problems that business departments needed and urgently needed to solve, or they were needed in the past but are not needed now. In this way, the supply of materials and the review of papers are often very slow; on the contrary, the relevant business departments are very happy to help. Secondly, we invite business departments to participate in the scientific report meetings we hold, and we try our best to ask business departments to review the papers. They often put forward many opinions that we cannot think of, and at the same time, they can understand our research situation and give us encouragement and support. For example, the industrial economics department's research on chart management and dispatching work in mines, the finance department's research on the adoption of advanced Soviet experience in commodity circulation fees of state-owned trading enterprises, and the statistics department's research on output indicators in the construction industry are all considered by relevant business departments to be research topics that have guiding significance for practical work, and they provide assistance in all aspects, which greatly encourages the confidence and courage of researchers. Thirdly, it is necessary to systematically collect various practical materials from business departments and strive to attend their relevant business meetings. Finally, it is also very necessary to organize teachers to visit the site and conduct production practice in a planned way, so as to increase teachers' perceptual knowledge.

Teachers Must Systematically Study Political Theory and Professional Knowledge

Our teaching staff must systematically study the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism. Because many of our papers cannot be called scientific forms, it is mainly because the authors are not good at "analyzing its different forms of development and exploring the internal connections of various forms" with regard to practical materials. (Preface to the second edition of "Capital," Volume 1) The most common phenomenon in our papers is that practical materials are practical materials, and theory is theory, and the two lack an internal connection. Why is this so? According to our experience, this is mainly because teachers have not systematically mastered the theory and the method of studying problems in Marxism. Marxism-Leninism is the only correct scientific foundation and ideological weapon. Only by constantly improving the level of Marxism-Leninism of teachers can we gradually improve the scientific level of teachers; otherwise, the level of scientific research cannot be improved. Therefore, we attach great importance to the political theory study of teachers. We have determined the courses of the basics of Marxism-Leninism, political economy, philosophy, and the history of the Chinese revolution as compulsory courses for each teacher, and at the same time, we advocate that teachers independently study the original works of Marxism-Leninism, so as to learn more from these ideological treasures.

The Marxist method is a general methodology. Every specific science, such as the study of economic science, political science, and historical science, has its specific methods. Therefore, to master business, we must not only learn general business knowledge, but also learn methods of studying problems, and learn how to apply the general principles of Marxism-Leninism to this business.

Experience has proved that without studying political theory and professional knowledge, we cannot do a good job in scientific research and cannot write good papers; however, if we do not conduct special research at the same time in the process of study, then we will not study well. Some teachers, although they have read a lot of theoretical books, they do not combine the theoretical books they read with special research, but only study them in isolation, so the effect is not good.

Cultivate Teachers' Interest in and Ability for Scientific Work

To carry out scientific research work, we must have a strong interest in this work. People's interests are different, but this can be cultivated in work. When inexperienced teachers begin to study scientific work, experienced teachers must give specific guidance and help, let them study the topics they are familiar with, and teach them how to use materials and analyze problems, so that they will improve their interest in scientific research work. At the beginning of our school, the encouragement and help of Soviet experts to our teachers in engaging in scientific research played a great role. One teacher described his experience in this way: "Without the help of Soviet experts, I myself would not believe that I could write a paper." To write a paper without believing that you can write a paper can greatly improve your interest in scientific research. On the contrary, some teachers originally had a high interest in scientific research, but in the research process, they did not receive the necessary help and guidance, and only explored on their own, which is often not easy to get results, which will weaken their interest in scientific research. Therefore, we must give patient and enthusiastic help to teachers in the process of engaging in research until they achieve results. In order to cultivate teachers' interest in scientific research work, we must attach great importance to teachers' labor. When we organize the writing of scientific papers, some teachers are originally very active, and after writing the papers, they have revised them several times after others put forward opinions; but after doing so, if they still cannot be adopted, their interest in writing will often be weakened. After a few times, they will not be willing to engage in scientific research work. Therefore, we should give them the opportunity to publish. We should try our best to publish their articles in the school journal, and actively recommend their articles to newspapers and periodicals, so as to improve their interest in engaging in scientific research work.

The interest in scientific work and the ability of scientific work affect each other. Among our teachers, there are many new teachers who do not have a very high research ability, but because they are enthusiastic about scientific research and often work hard, their research ability has improved rapidly. Naturally, there are also some people who originally had research ability, but they have not made much progress because they have not engaged in research for a long time. Therefore, only by enabling everyone to participate in scientific research work can we expect to improve everyone's research ability.

In order to improve everyone's interest in and ability for scientific work, we must create a strong atmosphere of scientific research in the school, and we must advocate bold debate, free discussion, and the courage to put forward different opinions. In the past, our school did very little in this regard except for some discussions on a few scientific issues. There were also few debates and criticisms, which could not but affect the development of research work. To this end, we must correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism, we must support those comrades who dare to put forward different opinions, and we must also encourage those comrades who have the courage to conduct self-criticism and are good at accepting criticism. Of course, we must also prevent other deviations, such as not cherishing the fruits of others' scientific research labor, and so on. This year, we have formulated scientific work evaluation and reward methods, and we are prepared to give material or spiritual rewards to those excellent or relatively excellent works, which will have a great impetus to the scientific research work of our school.

Carry out Scientific Research Work in a Planned and Organized Way

After more than three years of practice, teachers at Renmin University of China have realized that scientific research work and teaching work are equally important work. If we only do teaching work and do not do scientific research work, it is equivalent to not completing the tasks assigned by the Party and the state well. This understanding has become a powerful guarantee for us to continue to promote scientific research work.

We must regularize scientific work and resolutely overcome the situation of rushing tasks temporarily in order to have good works appear, and scientific research plan is an important means to ensure the regularization of scientific research work. Our scientific research plans are divided into three types: the school's overall plan, the teaching and research section's plan, and the individual plan. The school's overall plan is formulated on the basis of the teaching and research section's plan, and the realization of the teaching and research section's plan must be guaranteed by the individual plan of the teachers. Up to now, many teachers in our teaching and research sections have not seriously formulated individual scientific research plans, and most teachers' individual plans only stipulate the research topic and the completion time. Experience has proved that this kind of individual plan cannot be checked and cannot be well realized. Therefore, in addition to stipulating the topic and the completion time, individual scientific research plans must also stipulate the specific steps to be completed, such as: stipulating the content and scope of research, the source of materials, and the specific time for reading materials, analysis, and writing. Only in this way can it be convenient for inspection, and can the individual's interest in and ability for scientific work be better improved under the supervision of the plan.

For a long time, most of our teachers have felt that teaching work and scientific research work are contradictory, and believe that there is no time. This is objectively because our teaching tasks are indeed relatively heavy. But at the same time, it is also because our teachers do not yet understand that the characteristics of scientific research work in universities is to be combined with teaching. If we can formulate practical individual scientific research plans that are combined with teaching, and carry out work according to the plans, we can gradually overcome the contradiction between scientific research work and teaching tasks. In fact, the result of some teachers doing this is that they not only completed the teaching tasks, but also made achievements in scientific work. For example, a teacher in the National Economic Planning Teaching and Research Section formulated a five-year scientific research plan, stipulating the specific tasks to be completed each year and how to complete them, etc. At the same time, according to the individual five-year plan, he also formulated this year's plan. In this way, he can combine teaching and spare 15 hours a week to do scientific research work, so that scientific research and teaching work are well combined. If we persist, we can expect to achieve greater results.

The teaching and research section should strictly supervise the implementation of the individual scientific research work plans of the teachers, and conduct regular inspections. The general inspection method is to ask the teachers to report their research results at the teaching and research section meeting. In scientific work, in order to give play to the collective strength, friendly cooperation should be implemented. The way is collective discussion and research; however, scientific work is different from other work. It must be carried out through individual independent and in-depth study, and fully give play to the individual's enthusiasm and creativity in order to achieve greater results. Therefore, collective and individual research should be appropriately combined.

With the development and deepening of scientific work, the data work must be further strengthened. Most of the teaching and research sections in our school have established data rooms, but because our scientific work has not yet been deeply developed, the data in many data rooms are still insufficient. We plan to strengthen this work in the future.

Scientific Discussion Meeting is a Good Method to Promote Scientific Research Work

Renmin University of China learns from the experience of Soviet universities in scientific work and has established an annual scientific discussion meeting system. We have held three university-wide scientific discussion meetings. The university-wide scientific discussion meeting is one of the important forms of scientific activities in our school, which is used to review the achievements of the year's scientific research work, affirm achievements, point out shortcomings, summarize experience, promote work, and encourage teachers to strive forward on the scientific road. Under the promotion and influence of the scientific discussion meeting, the teaching and research sections of each department often invite relevant departments to participate and hold small-scale discussion meetings to discuss relevant scientific and practical issues, which has a very important role in the development of our scientific work.

In short, scientific research work in universities is a very important work. We should actively advocate it and encourage teachers to strive to advance towards science; but at the same time, we should also know that this is a very arduous work, and we must move forward steadily and not be impatient. Only in this way can we achieve greater results.

    中国人民大学开展科学研究工作的经验
    中国人民大学研究部副部长　张腾霄
    科学研究工作发展的一般情况
    中国人民大学的科学研究工作，从一九五○年学校成立以后便开展起来了。
    当时，我们的教员除了少数人有一定的研究能力之外，绝大多数都还年轻，并没有什么科学研究工作的经验。而且我们的教学干部，对这一新型学校的教学工作十分生疏，教员对所授课程也没有基础。在这种情况下，开展科学研究工作，当然要遇到许多困难。但根据苏联高等学校的经验，科学研究工作是提高教员和教学水平的重要手段。所以，我们在苏联专家的建议和帮助下，一开始就建立了科学研究工作制度，并坚持了下来。事实证明，这是完全必要和正确的。
    三年多来，我们的科学研究工作是在逐步地向前发展着。一九五○年九月开学不久，我们便在教研室组织了科学论文的写作，到十月的科学讨论会召开时，共选出三十一篇论文，都分别在全校性的科学讨论会上和分组会上做了报告。虽然这些科学论文有不少缺点，一般地说水平也不高，但这确是一个良好的开端。接着，我们又提出了建立经常的科学研究工作，要教员做出个人的科学研究工作计划，要教研室定期检查教员执行个人计划的情况，并经常组织小型讨论会。同时教研室和业务部门也建立了联系。第一学年第二学期我们共完成一百二十多个科学报告，这就使一九五一年第二次科学讨论会的论文不仅在数量上有所增加，在质量上也有所提高。第三学年的科学研究工作，由于大多数教员都系统地学习了政治理论和业务知识，并进行了生产实习，占有了一定的实际材料，从而就使科学研究和教学以及国家建设的实际有了进一步的结合。在第三次的科学讨论会中，各系的分组会开得都比较活跃，特别是关于“东北机械三厂按指示图表组织有节奏生产的研究”的报告，曾引起各企业单位的很大注意，尤其是中央人民政府第一机械工业部，认为这项工作的研究很能够解决他们工作中的实际问题。本学年的科学研究工作计划有三百三十一个专题，着手三十五种带有研究性质的讲义编写工作，我们有三百九十九位教员制订了科学研究工作计划，其中有四十七位系主任和教研室主任也参加了科学研究工作，订出了三十八个专题。所以我们的科学研究工作，无论就参加的人数，论文的数量和质量以及研究的范围来说，都是逐渐在增加、提高和扩大着的。
    但我们的科学研究工作是在曲折的道路上前进的。当我们开始提出科学研究工作时，曾有不少的教员认为这是一种过早的要求，理由是大家还没有掌握理论和业务。不过，由于在开始时，我们的要求较低，加之有苏联专家的具体帮助（如指示研究的方向，拟定论文提纲等），这就打破了一些教员对进行科学研究工作的畏难心理。但随着教员在理论和业务上的提高，科学论文不能停留在原有的水平上，所以，许多教员又产生了一种力不胜任的感觉。已写出的论文自己不满足，而别人则是批评多于鼓励。加以教学任务繁重，教学工作和科学研究工作发生了一定程度的矛盾，因此，就有少数人对科学研究工作抱着一种否定的态度，认为现在还没有从事科学研究工作的条件；甚至有人说：提出科学研究工作是“不自量力”，是“没学会走就想跑”；也有人说：“科学作业成了科学作孽”。还有的教员虽在原则上承认科学研究工作的重要，但由于教学任务重，时间少，和自己的水平低，则感到这是一种沉重的负担。这种思想在第三次科学讨论会后已发展到十分严重的程度。显然，如不解决这些思想问题，科学研究工作便不能前进。为此，我们曾经再三地强调研究工作的重要性，提倡实事求是的精神，具体的作法是：对不同的教员提出不同的要求，并着重指出，根据我们的情况，题目不宜大，问题涉及的范围也不宜太广，有的教员可以研究一定的专题，有的教员可以暂免科学研究的任务。同时使大家认识到，科学事业是一种艰巨的事业，不能够要求过高过急，不能一蹴而就，只有坚持不懈的努力，发挥韧性的战斗精神，才能逐渐看到研究的成果。
    这样，三年多来，我们的科学研究工作就得到了一定的成绩。这主要是我们培养了教员从事科学研究的习惯和兴趣，为今后进一步开展科学研究工作打下了必要的基础。
  必须结合实际需要
    “教学与实际联系，苏联经验与中国情况相结合”是我们教学工作的方针，也是我们科学研究工作的方针。中国人民大学是继承了老解放区理论联系实际的革命教育的优良传统，所以，在科学研究中资产阶级的“为学术而学术”，“为科学而科学”的现象是不存在的。总的看来，我们研究的问题都是紧密结合革命和建设的需要的。自然，我们所研究的问题，也并不是都做得很好的。我们过去曾有不少的科学专题不是根据实际的需要，从大量材料中抽引出来的，而是想像出来的，所以往往题目很大，涉及的范围很广，加之不能深入了解实际，占有大量材料，所以就只能重复或差不多重复着众所周知的道理，没有也不可能有什么新的意见；这样，就注定了这样的论文必然是脱离实际的，因而也是失败的。相反，我们有的科学专题，或者是在教学中感到的实际问题，或者是在学习苏联经验过程中有所体会，或者是根据国家建设的某些方面的实际需要而拟出的，同时，在研究过程中又能够钻研实际材料，所谓“回到实际研究中去”，这样的研究就能够解决问题，即使不能解决也可以提出较有价值的意见。例如上面提到的“东北机械三厂按指示图表组织有节奏生产的研究”一文，就是研究了大量的实际材料而后写出来的。这个题目，作者开始在东北机械三厂生产实习时就搜集了有关方面的材料，在开始研究过程中，感到材料不足，许多地方不能下判断，于是又到该厂进行了实际调查，通过各种方法搜集了材料，在进一步做了深入的分析研究之后，才写出了那篇比较成功的论文。
    科学研究结合实际需要的过程，是一个由低到高、由局部到全面地逐步发展的过程，不能一下要求过高、过急。根据我们的经验，没有做过科学研究工作的教员，应该直接结合教学需要，围绕着讲授的教材进行独立的专题研究，如讲授“国际关系史”的教员研究“中国在近代国际关系中的地位问题”、讲授“货币流通与信用”的教员研究“中国人民银行的现金出纳、信贷与发行业务”等。这样既能提高教学质量，又不致使教员感到科学研究工作是一种负担。随着教员对于理论和业务水平的提高，就应该结合中国建设的需要去从事现实中各种专题的研究，借以提高科学水平。
    为了使科学研究工作密切结合实际，我们曾经通过各种形式和有关业务部门建立了密切联系，在科学研究工作上实行友谊的合作。首先我们研究的问题要和有关部门商量，以便使我们所研究的问题能够是他们实际需要和迫待解决的问题，只有这样，教员才肯作深入研究，业务部门才能够积极帮助我们解决在研究过程中的困难。我们财经各系教研室曾有些科学专题不是业务部门所需要和迫待解决的问题，或过去需要现在不需要了，这样，不论是材料的供给，论文的审查都往往是很迟缓的；反之，各有关业务部门便很乐于帮助。其次，我们举行的科学报告会都邀请业务部门参加，论文都尽可能请业务部门审查，他们常常提出许多为我们所想不到的意见，同时，他们又可以了解我们的研究情况，给我们以鼓励和支持。譬如，工业经济系教员关于矿井的图表管理及调度工作的研究，财政系教员关于国营贸易企业商品流转费采用苏联先进经验的研究，统计系教员关于建筑业产量指标的研究等有关业务部门认为都是对实际工作有指导意义的研究课题，给予各方面的帮助，这就大大地鼓励了研究人员的信心和勇气。再次，要向业务部门系统地搜集各种实际材料，争取出席他们的有关业务会议。最后，有计划地组织教员到现场参观，进行生产实习，借以增加教员的感性知识，也是十分必要的。
  要使教员系统地学习政治理论
    和业务知识
    我们的教学干部必须系统地学习马克思列宁主义的基本理论。因为我们有不少论文，所以还不能称为科学形态的东西，主要是由于作者对于实际材料还不善于“分析它的不同的发展形态，并探寻出各种形态的内部联系。”（“资本论”一卷第二版跋）在我们的论文中最常见的现象，就是实际材料是实际材料，理论是理论，二者缺乏内在的联系。为什么会这样呢？根据我们的经验，这主要是由于教员还没有系统地掌握理论，掌握马克思主义研究问题的方法。马克思列宁主义是唯一正确的科学基础和思想武器，只有不断地提高教员的马克思列宁主义水平，才能逐步提高教员的科学水平；否则，科学研究的水平是无法提高的。因此，我们非常注重教员的政治理论学习。我们确定马克思列宁主义基础、政治经济学、哲学、中国革命史课程为每个教员的必修课程，同时并提倡教员独立地钻研马克思列宁主义原著，以便从这些思想宝库中学习到更多的东西。
    马克思主义的方法是一般的方法论，每门具体的科学，如经济科学、政治科学、历史科学的研究，都还有它具体的方法，因此，我们要掌握业务，就不仅要学习一般的业务知识，还要学习研究问题的方法，学习如何把马克思列宁主义的一般原理运用到本门业务中去。
    经验证明，不学习政治理论和业务知识，便不能做好科学研究工作，就写不出好的论文；但是，在学习的过程中如果不同时进行专题研究，那也是学习不好的。有些教员，他们虽然也读了不少理论书，但他们读的理论书，不是结合着专题研究来进行的，而只是孤立地学习，所以效果很不好。
  要培养教员对科学工作的志趣
      和能力
    要进行科学研究工作，就必须对这项工作具有浓厚的志趣。人的志趣是各不相同的，但这是可以在工作中培养的。没有经验的教员在开始学习科学作业时，必须由有经验的教员给予具体的指导和帮助，要让他们研究自己所熟悉的题目，教他们如何运用材料，分析问题，这样就会提高他们对科学研究工作的志趣。我们学校在开始时，苏联专家对我们教员从事科学研究工作的鼓励和帮助起了极大的作用。一个教员这样地叙述着他的经验：“如果没有苏联专家的帮助，我自己也不相信自己会写出论文来。”不相信自己能写出论文而写出了论文，这就能够大大提高从事科学研究的志趣。相反的，有些教员原来对于科学研究的志趣很高，但在研究过程中，得不到必要的帮助和指导，只凭自己摸索，往往不容易得到结果，这样便会减弱他对科学研究的志趣。所以，我们要在教员从事研究过程中给以耐心的热情的帮助，直到他做出成绩。为了培养教员对科学研究工作的志趣，要十分重视教员的劳动。在我们组织科学论文的写作时，有的教员本来是很积极的，写成论文之后，别人提出意见，曾经三番五次地修改；但是这样作了以后，如果还不能采用，他对于写作的志趣往往就减弱下来，经过几次之后，他便不愿意从事科学研究工作了。所以，我们应当给他们发表的机会。在校刊上尽量发表他们的文章，并应积极向报刊推荐他们的文章，借以提高他们对从事科学研究工作的志趣。
    科学工作的志趣和科学工作的能力是互相影响的。在我们的教员中，有不少新的教员并没有太高的研究能力，但由于他们热心科学研究、经常努力，他们研究的能力便迅速提高。自然也有的人本来是有研究能力的，但长期不从事研究，他们便没有多大的进步。所以，只有使大家都能够投身到科学研究工作中，我们才能设想提高大家的研究能力。
    为了提高大家对科学工作的志趣和能力，在学校内必须造成浓厚的科学研究的空气，要提倡大胆争辩，自由讨论，勇于提出不同的意见。我们的学校，在过去除了对少数科学问题有所讨论之外，在这方面一般做得是很不够的，争论和批评也较少，这就不能不影响研究工作的开展。为此，我们必须正确地开展批评和自我批评，要支持那些敢于提出不同意见的同志，也要鼓励那些有勇气进行自我批评和善于接受批评的同志。当然，同时也必须防止另外的偏向，例如不爱惜别人科学研究的劳动成果，等等。今年我们规定了科学作业评选及奖励办法，对于那些优异的或比较优异的作品，准备给予物质或精神的奖励，这对我校科学研究工作将会有极大的推动作用。
    要有计划有组织地进行科学研究工作
    中国人民大学的科学研究工作，经过三年多的实践，教员已经认识到科学研究工作和教学工作同样是重要的工作，如果只做教学工作，不做科学研究工作，那便等于没有很好地完成党和国家交给的任务。这种认识，已成为我们继续推动科学研究工作的有力保证。
    我们必须使科学工作经常化，坚决克服临时赶任务的那种状况，才能有好的作品出现，而科学研究计划正是保证科学研究工作经常化的重要手段。我们的科学研究计划分为全校总计划、教研室计划和个人计划三种。全校总计划是在教研室计划基础上制定的，而教研室计划的实现必须以教员个人计划做保证。到目前为止，我们不少教研室的教员还没有认真制定个人科学研究计划，多数教员的个人计划仅仅是拟定研究题目和完成时间，经验证明，这种个人计划是无法检查的，也是不能很好实现的。因此个人的科学研究计划除了规定题目和完成的时间以外，还必须规定完成的具体步骤，例如：规定研究的内容和范围，材料的来源以及阅读材料、分析和写作的具体时间等，只有这样，才便于检查，才能使个人对科学工作的志趣和能力在计划督促之下，得到更好的提高。
    我们多数教员长时期感到教学工作和科学研究工作是矛盾的，认为没有时间。这在客观上是因为我们的教学任务确实比较繁重。但同时，也因为我们的教员还不大了解，高等学校科学研究工作的特点是要结合教学进行的，如果能够订出切实的和教学相结合的个人科学研究计划，并根据计划去进行工作，就可以逐步克服科学研究工作和教学任务的矛盾。事实上，有的教员这样做的结果，不但完成了教学任务，而且在科学工作上也作出了成绩。例如国民经济计划教研室的一个教员订出了五年科学研究计划，规定每年完成的具体任务以及如何完成等等，同时根据个人五年计划又订出本年度计划，这样，他结合教学，每周能够抽出十五小时做科学研究工作，使科学研究和教学工作很好地结合起来。如果坚持下去，将会得到较大的成绩，这是可以预期的。
    教研室要严格监督教员个人科学研究工作计划的执行，定期进行检查，一般的检查方式是请教员在教研室会议上报告自己的研究成果。在科学工作中，为了发挥集体的力量，应该实行友谊的合作，其方式是集体的讨论和研究；但是科学工作不同于其他的工作，必须通过个人独立地深入地钻研，充分发挥个人的积极性和创造性才能收到更大的效果，所以集体的和个人的研究应该恰当地结合起来。
    随着科学工作的发展和深入，必须进一步加强资料工作。我们学校各教研室大都成立了资料室，但由于我们的科学工作还没有深入展开，所以不少资料室的资料仍是不充分的。今后我们准备加强这方面的工作。
    科学讨论会是推动科学研究
      工作的良好方法
    中国人民大学学习苏联高等学校科学工作的经验，确定了一年一度的科学讨论会制度。我们已经开过三次全校性的科学讨论会。全校性科学讨论会是我们学校科学活动的重要形式之一，用以检阅全年科学研究工作的成果，肯定成绩，指出缺点，总结经验，推动工作，并鼓励教员在科学道路上努力前进。在科学讨论会的推动和影响之下，各系教研室经常邀请有关部门参加，召开小型的讨论会，讨论有关科学的和实际的问题，这对我们的科学工作的开展有着极其重大的作用。
    总之，高等学校的科学研究工作是一项十分重大的工作，我们应该积极提倡，使教员努力向科学进军；但同时我们又应该知道，这是一件十分艰巨的工作，必须稳步前进，急躁不得。只有这样，我们才能得到更大的成绩。
