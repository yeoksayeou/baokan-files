    A Stone Has Been Lifted from My Heart
    By Our Correspondent Sun Zunian
    On November 16th of last year, after breakfast, Liu Bao'an, the head of Dayingshang Township in Ningjin County, Hebei Province, enthusiastically sought out Wang Ruchun, the secretary of the township's Party branch, to go to the county for a meeting. Along the way, they chatted amiably, and unknowingly, Liu Bao'an revealed his concerns: "Old Wang! This time the county meeting is most likely to arrange election work. You know my father's temperament, and I'm the township head. After the county meeting, let's have my position re-elected! If I completely detach myself from production like in the past, my relationship with my father will only worsen!" Wang Ruchun thought: Here you go again! He immediately replied: "I don't agree. Your family has enough manpower. Your father has backward ideas, you should persuade him, not follow him backward! Re-election is not up to you and me, it depends on the opinions of the masses!" They discussed back and forth, unknowingly arriving at the county town.
    The meeting lasted for several days, and unexpectedly, the county Party secretary and county head reported on the general line of the state's transition period and the issue of grain procurement. Not a single word was mentioned about the general election. Liu Bao'an's enthusiastic mood before the meeting immediately disappeared, and his heart felt heavier than ever, as if weighed down by a stone.
    Was Liu Bao'an unwilling to take the socialist road? No. Was he unwilling to sell surplus grain to the state? No. His difficulty was: since joining the Communist Party of China in 1944, he had been involved in village work for several years as a militia member, finance and grain director, and security officer. Although he was not detached from production at that time, his active work sometimes delayed family production, which was opposed by his father, Liu Luocheng. Whenever he went home for meals, his father would scold: "Working for public affairs, eating private meals, you're good-for-nothing." The father and son often argued after only a few words. Liu Bao'an couldn't find a way to reconcile with his father and had repeatedly requested to take on fewer responsibilities. Whenever Liu Bao'an raised such opinions, Wang Ruchun always replied: "Can you see anyone suitable in the village to replace your work? Patiently persuade your father! He's getting old, you should be more considerate. The relationship will improve over time. It's wrong for a Communist Party member to compromise with backward thinking." In the spring of 1953, the superior government appointed him as the head of Dayingshang Township. The government subsidized him 150,000 yuan per month, and from then on, he no longer ate at home regularly, but his relationship with his father became even more estranged. This time, Liu Bao'an's old thoughts resurfaced when he went to the county for a meeting.
    This expanded cadre meeting in the county happened to be about the general line of the state's transition period, selling surplus grain, and taking the socialist road. Liu Bao'an knew that his family had harvested a lot of grain in 1953. After a rough calculation, he figured that after deducting what the whole family ate, and including the grain stored in 1952, there would still be an excess of 4,100 jin. Should he sell it? He couldn't make the decision himself. Persuading his father was uncertain. Not selling it? He was the township head and feared affecting the township's grain procurement work. He was in a dilemma and couldn't think of a good solution, so he sat silently on the sidelines, listening to others' discussions.
    Some district cadres noticed Liu Bao'an's abnormal mood and had individual talks with him, telling him not to fail to report because his father's thinking was not open. He should report it at the meeting and then actively find ways to persuade his father. Through this grain purchase work, he should also improve his relationship with his father. With the help and encouragement of district and township cadres, Liu Bao'an finally announced at the expanded county cadre meeting that he would take the lead in selling 4,100 jin of surplus grain.
    After Liu Bao'an returned to the township, it happened that his father had gone to a certain unit in Datong half a month ago to visit his second son, Qun'an, and had not yet returned. At this time, Liu Bao'an was like an ant on a hot pot, restless walking, standing, and sitting at his desk. He had already reported it at the meeting, how could he deliver on his promise? Township and district cadres came to help him with ideas. Fortunately, many people had wisdom, and they came up with two ideas: immediately write to his second son, Qun'an, asking him to persuade his father, and find someone his father trusted to persuade him. Liu Bao'an sent the letter, and in the evening, he went to Zhou Shuanke, the head of Xiaoliu Village Township, who was on good terms with his father, asking him to help persuade him. Zhou Shuanke enthusiastically gave Liu Bao'an a clever idea, he said: "In my opinion, take advantage of the opportunity when your father is not at home and sell the surplus grain. This is a good thing, not a bad thing. As long as you explain the reasons to him clearly when he comes back and hand over all the money to him, what can he do to you!" Liu Bao'an shook his head and said: "That won't do. You know my father's temperament. When he's at home, he considers the grain very precious. Every half month or twenty days, he suns the grain once. When the county was carrying out grain procurement in your township, my father heard some rumors. Before leaving, he told my mother to hide the grain well. He said: 'When I'm not home, no one is allowed to take the grain away.' If I sell the grain, my mother will fight me to the death. Besides, when the old man comes back, he'll surely add fuel to the fire."
    Liu Bao'an was anxious for several days. Before the township's Party study of the general line and grain procurement was over, Liu Luocheng returned from Datong. Early the next morning, Liu Bao'an intentionally fetched water, pulled cotton stalks, and delivered manure at home, busy all day, trying to win his father's favor. After dinner, his father was sitting on the kang smoking, Liu Bao'an took a stool and plucked up the courage to sit on the edge of the kang, warmly asking about his journey and how his second son was doing at work, study, and life. This time, unexpectedly, his father's answer was very kind. He took the opportunity to ask if his second brother had received his letter, and his father replied: "Received it."
    Liu Bao'an saw that his father was not angry yet, knowing that his second brother must have talked to his father, but he didn't know if his father had thought it through. He thought: Since Dad already knows, why not speak plainly! He began to tell his father about the general line, about how farmers should sell surplus grain to the state… Finally, he also said: "I am the township head and must take the lead."
    Liu Luocheng suddenly put his pipe on the kang table and said: "Bao'an, stop talking, I understand everything."
    Liu Bao'an was still not at ease, not knowing whether his father agreed to sell the surplus grain, and immediately asked: "Dad, will you sell the surplus grain or not!"
      "There is no reason not to sell it to the state, do you still want to live a muddled life!"
    At this time, Liu Bao'an was overjoyed and didn't know what else to say to his father. But he still couldn't figure out why his father was so open this time.
    "I regarded the grain as a treasure, not wanting to lend it out or wait for a high price, isn't it all to prevent famine years? Farmers rely on grain for clothing and food. When the Guomindang ruled this area ten years ago, all goods in the market were expensive, but grain was cheap. Now a斗 (dǒu) of wheat buys more than four chi of cloth, more than twenty jin of salt, and more than four jin of oil than in the past. Life is much better! I was still using old thinking to look at today's new society, I really deserve to die! Going to Datong to visit my second son, Qun'an, I'm over sixty years old, and it was the first time in my life that I traveled far, taking a car and then a train, I've seen the world. Everywhere, workers are building. Along the way, people respect the elderly so much, and the comrades in the army call me 'Old Grandpa' very affectionately, serving water and offering cigarettes thoughtfully. Your brother was a poor boy eight years ago when he joined the army, illiterate, but now he can read newspapers and write letters, and he leads a company! This is all thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, society has developed, and people have also progressed, making me understand that now is not the past! Qun'an also repeated to me the beliefs you gave him, and persuaded me, saying that our family is a military family, and my elder brother is the local township head, so we should take the lead in selling surplus grain to the state to support national construction. What's there to say, I agreed without a word." Speaking here, Liu Luocheng felt sad and hated his past attitude towards his eldest son. He told Liu Bao'an to forget the past and work hard for the people. The father and son also planned to deposit the money from selling the surplus grain in the bank to prepare for expanding production in 1954.
    That night, the father and son talked until late before going to bed. Early the next morning, Liu Bao'an went to the township government, and as soon as he entered, he called out to the work team comrades: "Old Liang! Old Ge! My father's thinking is open! This time, I feel like a stone has been lifted from my heart!"

    心坎上的一块石头落下了
    本报记者　孙祖年
    去年十一月十六日，吃罢早饭，河北宁晋县大营上乡乡长刘保安兴致勃勃地找乡的党支部书记王入春到县里去开会。一路上两人聊天聊的顶欢畅，不知不觉地刘保安就把自己的心事说了出来：“老王！这回县里开会十有八成是布置选举工作。你是乡的党支部书记，俺爹的脾气你也不是不知道，这回县里开完会回来，把我的乡长改选一下吧！要像过去那样完全脱离生产，我和爹的关系就更要闹翻了呀！”王入春心想：你这一套又来了；嘴里马上答道：“我不赞成，你家人手又不缺，你爹爹思想差劲，要说服他，那能跟着他倒退呢！改选不是你我能决定的，要看群众的意见呀！”两人谈来谈去不知不觉地到了县城。
    一连开了几天会，出乎刘保安的意料之外，县委书记和县长报告的是国家过渡时期的总路线和收购粮食的问题，没有一个字提到普选。刘保安开会前的那种兴致勃勃的情绪立即消失了，从此心头上更像压了一块石头似的沉重。
    刘保安是不是不愿走社会主义道路呢？不是的；是不是不愿把余粮卖给国家呢？不是的。他的难处是：自一九四四年参加了中国共产党以后，在村里搞过几年民兵、财粮主任和治安员，那时虽不是脱离生产，但因为他工作积极，有时耽误了家里一些生产，遭到他爹刘洛成的反对，每当他回去吃饭，他爹就骂：“办公家的事，吃私家的饭，没有出息的东西。”父子俩常常说不上几句话就要顶起来。刘保安想不出办法来同他爹和好，曾不只一次地要求少担任一些工作。每当刘保安这样提出意见，王入春总是回答：“你看村里那有适当的人替换你的工作呢？耐心打通你爹的思想吧！他年老了，你要多体贴些，天长日久关系就会好起来。一个共产党员向落后思想妥协是不对的。”一九五三年春天，上级政府又委任他为大营上乡乡长。每月公家津贴他十五万元，从此他就不再经常回家吃饭了，但和他爹的关系更加疏远起来。刘保安这次去县里开会，旧念头又复活了。
    这次县上的扩大干部会偏偏又是讨论国家过渡时期的总路线、卖余粮和走社会主义道路的问题。刘保安知道家里一九五三年收了不少粮食，自己暗下一算账，除掉全家吃的，连一九五二年存粮，还能多出四千一百斤。要卖吧！自己不能作主，去动员他爹又没有把握；不卖吧，自己是乡长，又怕影响全乡收购粮食的工作；进退两难，想不出一个好办法，只得闷闷不乐地坐在一旁，听别人讨论。
    有的区干部发现了刘保安的情绪不正常，和他进行了个别谈话，告诉他不要因为他爹的思想不通就不报，应该在大会上报出来，再积极想办法打通他爹的思想，通过这次购粮工作，还要搞好和他爹的关系。刘保安在区、乡干部的帮助与鼓励下，终于在全县扩大干部会议上报出了自己要带头卖出余粮四千一百斤。
    刘保安回乡后，正巧赶上他爹半月前去大同某部队看望二弟群安还没有回来。这时刘保安像热锅上的蚂蚁一样，走也不安，站也不安，坐下来办公还是不安。自己在大会上已经报了，怎样去兑现呢？乡干部、区干部又来帮助他出主意。总算人多智慧高，想了两个办法：立即写信给二弟群安，叫他说服他爹，再找他爹的知己人来动员。刘保安寄了信，连晚又去找和他爹要好的小刘村乡乡长周拴科，要他也帮忙说说。周拴科马上热心地给刘保安出了个妙主意，他说：“以我看，就趁你爹不在家的机会，把余粮卖了，这是好事，又不是坏事，回来只要把道理同他讲清楚，钱完全交给他，他还能把你怎样！”刘保安听了摇摇头说：“这不沾（不行的意思），我爹那股劲你也清楚，在家的时候，他把粮食看的可珍贵，每隔半月二十天，就把粮食晒一次。县上在你们乡搞粮食收购时，爹听了一些风声，临走还交代俺娘，要把粮食藏好。他说：‘我不在家谁也不许把粮食搞走。’我卖了粮，娘马上就要和我拼死拼活的，再说老头子一回来，保险火上添油。”
    刘保安焦急了好几天。全乡党内学习总路线和收购粮食还没有结束的时候，刘洛成从大同回来了。第二天一清早，刘保安就有意地给家里挑水，拔棉花秸，送粪，忙了一天，想讨得他爹的欢心。晚饭后，他爹正坐在炕上抽烟，刘保安拿了一张板凳硬着头皮坐在炕边，亲热地问长问短：“一路上可平安呀！二弟的工作、学习、生活可好呀！”这次也出乎刘保安意料之外，他爹的回答很和气。他就瞅了一个空子问二弟收到了他的信没有，他爹也回答说：“收到了。”
    刘保安看他爹还没有生气，知道二弟准和他爹讲过了，但不知道他爹想开了没有。心想：反正爹也知道了，不如打开窗子说亮话吧！他就向他爹讲起总路线，讲起农民应该把余粮卖给国家……最后，他还说：“我是乡长，要起带头作用。”
    刘洛成突然把烟袋往炕桌上一放说：“保安，别说了，我全明白了。”
    刘保安还不放心，不知道他爹答应不答应卖余粮，就紧接着追问：“爹，余粮卖不卖呀！”
      “哪有不卖给国家的道理，还要过糊涂的日子吗！”
    这时，刘保安心里可乐坏了，不知道再向他爹说什么好。但他还搞不清楚他爹这次为什么这样开通起来了。
    “俺把粮食当个宝，一不想放债，二不想等高价卖，还不是为了防备饥荒年，庄稼人穿衣、吃饭，那一样不是指望着粮食。十年前刮民党（国民党）统治这一带时，市场上什么百货都贵，就是粮食贱。现在一斗麦子比过去多买四尺多市布，多买二十多斤盐，多买四斤多油。日子好过多啦！俺还是用旧脑筋来看今天的新社会，真是该死啦！这下去大同看望二小子群安，俺六十多啦，有生以来第一次出远门，坐了汽车，又坐火车，可见了世面了，好远的路不几天就到了。到处工人们都在建设。一路上人们又都那样尊重年老的人，部队的同志见了也是老大爷前老大爷后的叫得满亲热，倒水点烟招待也周到。你弟八年前参军时是一个穷小子，一字不识，现在也能看报纸和写信了，还带一连人哩！这都是共产党和毛主席领导的好，社会发展了，人也进步了，使俺明白了现在不是过去啦！群安又把你给他的信念给我听，又说又劝地打通俺的思想，说俺家是军属，哥哥又是当地的乡长，应该带头把余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设。这有什么说的，俺没有说过不字就答应了。”讲到这里，刘洛成心里难过起来，痛恨自己过去不该对大儿子那种态度。他叫刘保安把以往的事都忘掉，好好地为老百姓办事。父子俩又计划把卖余粮的钱存到银行里，准备一九五四年扩大生产。
    这一晚，父子俩一直谈到深夜才睡觉。第二天一早，刘保安就去乡政府，一进门就叫工作组的同志：“老梁呀！老葛呀！俺爹思想通啦！这一回，俺心上像落下了一块石头似的轻松啦！”
