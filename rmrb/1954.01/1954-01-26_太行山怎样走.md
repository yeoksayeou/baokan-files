How to Traverse the Taihang Mountains
By our reporter Chen Yongjin

Was the road really impassable?

Several years ago, when a production movement was launched in the Taihang Mountains, many people asked: Other people are carrying out production movements, what can we do? There are so many rocks on the mountain, we can't move them, and there is no large area of land, where can we produce?

When cadres were promoting the agricultural mechanization of the Soviet Union to farmers, some simply pointed to the small plots of land on the mountain and said: "Comrades, are there any small tractors? Look at my land, it's only the size of a palm, even a plow and harrow can't fit, how can we use a tractor?" When cadres promoted collectivization and cooperation, some said: "Look at our land, how can it be collective? A few people standing together can't even bend over." Even some cadres didn't know how to lead the masses to prosperity. They also said: Only in the plains can we move towards prosperity and socialism. In our mountain gullies, not to mention tractors and harvesters, even iron-wheeled carts can't come up. They looked left and right, seeing only rocks and stone mountains. Did anyone know if there were conditions under these rocks that could lead to prosperity and socialism? No one knew.

In the spring of 1948, a secretary named Hou Yujie was transferred from another county to the Yushi People's Government. Seeing this situation, he often wondered: In a place like Yushi, which is either mountains or gullies, how should the masses carry out production? How can we change the current state of poverty?

That winter, Hou Yujie, carrying his small luggage, went to some villages along the banks of the Zhuozhang River. By this time, he had been promoted to deputy county head. A farmer from Hancun told him: "County head, the Zhuozhang River has washed away our good land. In the past, the Zhuozhang River was very narrow. The people working on both sides could talk to each other during breaks, and they could throw dry food across during meals. Look at the riverbank now, it's four or five li wide!" The elderly people told him regretfully: In the past, there were trees all over the mountains and on both sides of the Zhuozhang River. Since the trees disappeared, the crops have not been good, and the Zhuozhang River rolls back and forth, washing away good land. Some elderly people still have land deeds from decades or even a hundred years ago. They pointed to the river bends of the Zhuozhang River and told Hou Yujie: This piece of land used to be here.

"Why has the good land of the past become barren?" Hou Yujie always pondered this question. No matter which village he went to, he asked the masses about this question. "In the past, the good land was taken away by the landlords, so we ran to the foot of the mountains to open up land," the people of Dazhai Village told him. "When the land at the foot of the mountain was taken away, we ran to the mountainside, and finally to the top of the mountain. Twenty-eight of the fifty-three households in Dazhai Village ran to the mountains to open up land. In this way, generation after generation, the hard-working people became poor." So that's how it was. Because the hillsides that should not have been cleared were cleared, the Taihang Mountains lost their cover, and were often hit by floods. When mountain floods came down, the land was washed away. Hou Yujie's mind began to clear.

In 1950, Yushi County held a People's Congress. Representatives from the countryside poured out the harm that the Zhuozhang River caused them at the meeting, and proposed: "The country is undergoing major construction, and we request the central government to build large dams on both sides of our Zhuozhang River to manage the Zhuozhang River. Wouldn't the land we lost be recovered?" Hou Yujie said when answering the proposal: "There are many places in the country that need construction. We don't have the conditions for that here yet. Let's plant more trees to manage the river!" That year, Hou Yujie specially sent people to conduct a thorough investigation along the Zhuozhang River: If trees were planted on both sides of the Zhuozhang River, 120,000 mu of land could be recovered. If these lands were well cultivated, Yushi's grain income would double. That year, they clearly knew the importance of planting trees and afforestation, and began to call on the masses to plant trees. However, this work was still carried out without organization or order.

In the spring of 1951, Chi Biqing, secretary of the Yuchi Prefectural Committee, returned from an investigation in Zuoquan County and gave an exciting report in Yushi. He said that 70 percent of the things Zuoquan exported were peppercorns, walnuts, and sheepskins. He cited the example of a farmer in Tongyu District, Zuoquan, who accumulated peppercorns for three years and sold them for more than 18 million yuan - at least equal to more than 20,000 jin of grain. Therefore, to lead the people in the mountainous areas to prosperity, they cannot just circle around a few acres of barren land.

Since then, the tree planting and afforestation movement in Yushi has been launched. Now Yushi has planted more than 10 million trees, and planted 6 million trees and sowed seeds on 15,000 mu of barren hills last year alone. Hou Yujie said: "Ten years from now, the income from these trees will be ten to thirty times the grain income of 1953."

When people see the light, they will generate the power to move towards the light. Now Yushi has emerged more than 130 model afforestation societies and groups, and more than 2,400 model afforestation workers.

        A Mountain Village

Here is the source of the Zhuozhang River, here is Zhangyuan Ridge, here is Jiunv Mountain, here is Laohu Gully, and here are more high mountains and ridges that cannot be named. The Taihang Mountains show its majestic spirit here. The Zhuozhang River flows down from this high mountain. Here it is difficult to imagine why this small river is called the Zhuozhang River. Duan Tongnian, the secretary of the Shiyuan Village branch, pointed to the clear water and described: "Who would have thought that this section of the Zhuozhang River would be so clear? In 1950, it was still very muddy when it rained."

Shiyuan Village was an old base area during the Anti-Japanese War. Even now, the caves where they fought against the enemy are still left on Laohu Gully. Although various movements and land reforms have been carried out here, the annual grain harvest is still not enough due to the barren land. Even in 1950, one-third of the families were short of food for several months each year. If we talk about the days before the Anti-Japanese War, only three families in Shiyuan Village had enough to eat and wear. Let's take a look at Shiyuan Village after the mountain was closed in 1950! Last year, only two families in the whole village did not have enough to eat, one because they had a long-term sick person; the other because they had few laborers. When the state purchased grain, except for the two families who did not have enough to eat, everyone else sold grain to the state. Duan Tongnian said: "In the past, I planted 20 mu of land, and it was not enough for my family of three to eat. Since the mountain was closed, I no longer planted the land on the top of the mountain, but the land at the foot of my mountain is fertile. In addition, with more than 1,000 jin of grain from sideline production a year, we have enough to eat and wear."

Duan Tongnian led us up the shady slope of Laohu Gully Mountain. The oil pine trees here grow as densely as the birch trees in the Greater Khingan Mountains. The mountains, snow, and trees here make it difficult to distinguish from the large forest area of ​​the Northeast. The facts here tell those who do not believe that forest belts can be built in the Taihang Mountains: their ideas are wrong. Duan Tongnian pointed to those mountains and said: "In the past, there were big pine trees on this mountain! The people were so poor that they had no choice but to cut them down and sell them as firewood. Look, the small oil pines on the back of Laohu Gully have grown up again." Duan Tongnian pointed to Jiunv Mountain again and said: "Those are mountain peach and mountain apricot trees. In the spring, this place becomes a mountain of flowers. These trees have grown up in the past few years." When talking about these mountain peach and mountain apricot trees, Duan Tongnian became very interested. He said: "The kernels of these wild fruits can be exported, and one jin of apricot kernels can be exchanged for three or four jin of grain. In 1953, our Shiyuan Village planted mountain apricots and mountain peaches on the sunny slopes of that big mountain. In the future, we plan to plant these things on the sunny slopes of the mountains, and oil pines on the shady slopes. Don't look at this small village in the deep mountains, it really has a future." Gong San'gang, director of the Yu (She) Tai (Gu) Afforestation Bureau, calculated an account for Shiyuan Village: Shiyuan Village has more than a dozen barren mountains, with a barren mountain area of ​​at least 10,000 mu. Each mu can plant 600 mountain peach and mountain apricot trees, which will bear fruit in three or four years. Calculated at two jin of fruit kernels per tree, each mu can harvest 1,200 jin of peach and apricot kernels, which can be exchanged for 1,200 jin of grain. How much can be harvested if 10,000 mu of mountain slopes are planted with trees? A full 10 million jin of grain. Duan Tongnian said: "We can't live blindly. Who would have thought that these wild fruit trees that were burned as firewood would become money trees?"

When we came back from the mountain, the shepherds also drove the herds down the mountain. The sound of bells on the necks of cows and sheep makes people feel the joy of the people in the deep mountains. Now Shiyuan Village has 80 cows and more than 200 sheep, but in 1950 Shiyuan Village only had 30 cows and 40 sheep. Without livestock, it is difficult to imagine improving the yield of the land here. Their land on the mountain ridges is mostly sheep grazing land. The larger the flock, the more grain they can harvest. If there is no large area of ​​forest belt in the Taihang Mountains to prevent natural disasters, it is impossible to harvest more grain.

Since the closure of the mountains for forest cultivation, Shiyuan Village now only increases the wealth of more than 30,000 jin of grain from a few minor incomes such as collecting pine cones, cutting rafters, weaving baskets, and selling firewood. These incomes allow them to invest in the land, so the land is fertile. Ten years from now, this place will be full of fruit trees, timber forests, and herds of cattle and sheep. Don't look at the fact that iron-wheeled vehicles cannot pass through now, cars will come then!

Another Mountain Village

Zhang Zhiquan had not been home for eight years. Eight years ago, he voluntarily put on his military uniform and joined the People's Liberation Army, fighting from Shanxi to the Northeast, and from the Northeast to the Central Plains. Last summer, he returned from the army, but he couldn't find his village along the Zhuozhang River Bay. Strangers are indeed difficult to find this mountain village, because the village of Nancun in this river set has been sheltered by the dense rows of poplar and willow trees along the Zhuozhang River.

The changes in Nancun have taken place in recent years. When Zhang Zhiquan joined the army, the Zhuozhang River here was still four or five li wide, and there were very few trees on the riverbank. As long as it rained, the fertile land on both sides of the river would be submerged. The people of Nancun still remember that ten years ago, the torrents of the Zhuozhang River washed away 1,000 mu of their good land. In recent years, after Nancun planted hundreds of thousands of trees, the river has slowly narrowed, and more than 100 mu of good land has been recovered. Chen Xuren, director of the Nancun Forestry Cooperative, pointed to the green wheat fields and said: This is the result of our planting trees. Without so many trees, it would be impossible to harvest these wheats. The people of Nancun watched the trees they planted grow up. Everyone in Nancun was excited and encouraged by this large forest belt. When we were walking in the large forest belt of Nancun, Chen Xuren constantly touched the zhang-high poplar trees and said: "Look, these can be used as rafters. In another ten years, 20,000 purlins and 300,000 rafters can be produced, which is equivalent to several million jin of grain." Not only that, the people of Nancun are increasing the speed of planting 100 trees per person per year. In addition, they also sowed walnut trees and apple trees. It is these that attract the people of Nancun. Now only two people in Nancun have not joined the Forestry Cooperative.

The road traveled by the Forestry Cooperative, which is welcomed by the people of Nancun, has not been smooth sailing either.

When the superiors called for planting trees in 1949, the people of Nancun also planted some trees. Because the forest rights were not determined at that time, and no attention was paid to technology when planting trees, only 9,000 of the 14,000 trees they planted survived. After they afforested in the Zhuozhang River beach, they selected the 60-year-old Chen Huide to look after the forest, and announced a ban on grazing cattle and sheep. In this way, some people became dissatisfied. The shepherd said: "Climbing the ridges in autumn and staying in the bay in summer, where can we graze sheep if the river beach is closed?" People who used to pick firewood on the river beach also said that there was no place to pick firewood. Old man Chen Huide could still persuade the people in his village, but he really couldn't do anything about people from other villages. He had a quarrel with the people of Yunzu Village and found the district. The next day, people from other villages came to graze sheep again. Chen Huide had no choice but to pretend he didn't see it, but the people in his village criticized him, saying that he was soft on the hard and afraid of the hard. In 1950, Chen Shuiyuan, a young man, was replaced as the forestry commissioner. Chen Shuiyuan was also afraid of offending people, so he simply didn't care.

The trees slowly grew taller. People's concern for the trees also increased. Many people suggested: "If it is public, the public should manage it. If it belongs to individuals, let's divide it." The idea of dividing the forest became more and more popular in Nancun. Some departments even selected representatives for the forest division. Chen Xuren, the deputy secretary of the Nancun branch, became uneasy in this public opinion of dividing the forest. He thought: If the forest is divided, whoever wants to cut it will cut it, won't it be over in a few years? The Zhuozhang River cannot be controlled. Isn't the Party calling on the masses to take the road of collectivization and cooperation all day long? Isn't dividing the forest the opposite of the Party's requirements? He raised the question at the party member meeting. More than 30 party members in Nancun agreed to take the road of cooperation, only Chen Xianglin disagreed. Most party members criticized him. With the help of most party members, Chen Xianglin made a self-criticism. After the fermentation was mature among the party members, it was discussed at the mass meeting. Most people said that it is good not to divide the forest, but it must be managed seriously. Many people clamored to establish a forestry cooperative. The Nancun Forestry Cooperative was established at the meeting, and Chen Xuren was elected as the director. The Forestry Cooperative also established a planning section, a finance section, a technology section, and a forest protection section. Since the establishment of the Forestry Cooperative, the phenomenon of destroying forests has disappeared. Now planting trees has become a habit of the people of Nancun. Their forest area is expanding year after year. The experience of the people of Nancun proves that the huge work of building a forest belt that they are engaged in does not delay agricultural production. Last year, each person planted 100 trees, and it was finished in two days.

From Shiyuan Village, from Nancun, from many mountain villages in Yushi County, people have seen the road that the Taihang Mountains should take.

    太行山怎样走
    本报记者　陈勇进
    道路真的不通了吗
    几年前太行山上开展生产运动的时候，不少人曾经提出：人家开展生产运动，我们开展什么？山上石头多，开又开不动，大片的土地又没有，往那里生产去呢？
    当干部向农民宣传苏联怎样实行农业机械化的时候，有的人干脆指着山上的小片片土地说：“同志，有小拖拉机没有？你看俺那土地像个巴掌大，连犁、耙都放不下，怎样能使拖拉机呢？”干部们宣传集体化、合作化的时候，有的人就说：“你看我们那地里能集体吗？几个人一站连腰也不能弯呀。”甚至有些干部也不知如何领导群众才能走向富裕。他们还说：平川地里才能走向富裕、才能走向社会主义，我们山沟沟里，别说拖拉机、收割机，连铁轮大车也上不来。他们左看看是石头，右看看是石山，石头底下有没有条件通向富裕、通向社会主义？谁也不知道。
    一九四八年春天，从外县调到榆社人民政府一个秘书，名叫侯玉阶。他看到这种情况，就常常考虑：像榆社这样个地方，不是大山便是河沟，群众到底如何进行生产？如何改变现在的贫困状况呢？
    这年的冬天，侯玉阶背着小行李到了浊漳河边的一些村庄，这时他已经被提拔为副县长了。韩村的一个农民向他叙述着：“县长，浊漳河把我们的好地都冲走了，过去浊漳河可窄啦，两边做活的老百姓休息时可以说话，吃饭时可以把干粮扔过去，你看现在这河滩没有个四五里路宽呀！”老年人惋惜地告诉他：过去这大山上和浊漳河两岸都是树，自从没了树木，庄稼也不好好收了，浊漳河滚来滚去，好地都被冲走了。有的老年人至今还保存着几十年和一百年前的文契，他们指着浊漳河河湾给侯玉阶说：过去这块地就在这里。
    “为什么过去的好地竟变成了荒滩？”侯玉阶总在考虑这个问题，不论走到哪村，都要向群众询问这个问题。“过去好地被地主夺走了，就跑到山根根上开地，”大寨村的老百姓这样告诉他：“山根上的地被夺走了，又跑到半山腰，最后跑到山尖尖上，大寨村的五十三户人家跑到山上开地的有二十八家。就这样，世世代代下来，勤劳的人民穷了。”——原来如此，由于把不该开的山坡开了，太行山失去了被覆，便常常闹水灾，山洪冲下来，土地被漂走了。侯玉阶心里开始明亮了。
    一九五○年榆社县召开人民代表会，来自农村的代表们在大会上倾吐着浊漳河对他们的危害，并提议说：“国家大建设哩，我们请求中央在咱们浊漳河两岸修上大坝，把浊漳河管起来，咱们漂走的土地不就回来了吗？”侯玉阶在解答提案时说：“国家需要建设的地方很多，目前我们这里还不具备这样的条件，我们还是多栽树来管河吧！”这一年侯玉阶专门派人沿着浊漳河作了一次彻底的调查：如果浊漳河两岸都种上树，可以收回十二万亩土地。这些土地种好了，将使榆社的粮食收入增加一倍。这
  一年他们比较明确地知道植树造林的重要了，便开始号召群众造林。可是，这件工作毕竟还是在没有组织、没有秩序的情况下进行的。
    一九五一年的春天，榆次地委书记池必卿从左权县调查回来，在榆社做了一个令人兴奋的报告。他说左权往外出口的东西中，有百分之七十是花椒、核桃、羊皮。他举了左权桐峪区一个农户的例子，那个农户积了三年的花椒，一下卖了一千八百多万元至少等于两万多斤粮食。因此领导山区人民走向富裕就不能光在几亩瘠薄的土地上打圈子。
    从此以后，榆社的植树造林运动就开展起来了。现在榆社已经植树一千多万棵了，仅去年一年就植树六百多万棵，荒山播种一万五千亩。侯玉阶说：“十年以后，这些树木的收入将等于一九五三年粮食收入的十倍到三十倍。”
    当人们看到光明的时候，就会产生走向光明的力量。现在榆社已出现了一百三十多个造林模范社、组，造林模范有二千四百多人。
      一个山村
    这里是浊漳河的发源地，这里有漳源岭，这里有九女山，这里有老虎沟，这里有更多的叫不出名字的高山大岭。太行山在这里显示出它那巍峨的气魄。浊漳河从这高山上流下来。在这里你很难想起这个小河流为什么叫浊漳河。石源村的支部书记段同年指着那清清的流水叙述着：“谁能想到这段浊漳河清得这样快呢？一九五○年的时候，下点雨还混得不像样子。”
    石源村是抗日战争时期的老根据地，直到现在老虎沟上还留着和敌人斗争的洞洞。这里虽然经过各种运动和土地改革，由于土地过于瘠薄，每年收获的粮食仍然不够用。就在一九五○年也还有三分之一的人家每年缺几个月的粮食。如果说起抗战前的日子，石源村只有三家有吃穿。让我们看看一九五○年封山后的石源村吧！去年全村只有两家不够吃，一家因为长期有病人；一家是劳动力少。国家购粮的时候，除那两家不够吃的外，都卖给了国家粮食。段同年说：“过去我种二十亩地，三口人就是不够吃。自从封山后，山尖尖上的土地都不种了，可是我山下的土地肥了。再加上一年有一千多斤粮食的副业生产，就吃穿有余了。”
    段同年领着我们从老虎沟山的阴坡爬上去，这里的油松树长得像大兴安岭的白桦树一样稠。这里的山、雪和树木，使人很难和东北的大森林地带分开。这里的事实告诉那些不相信太行山上能营造林带的人们：他们的想法是错误的。段同年指着那几架大山说：“过去这山上可都是大松树呀！老百姓穷苦得没办法都砍着当柴卖了。你看老虎沟背面的小油松又长起来了。”段同年又指着九女山说：“那都是山桃、山杏子树，一到春天这里就成花山了。这些树还是这几年里面长起来的。”提起这些山桃、山杏树，段同年的兴趣可大了。他说：“这些野果果仁可出国呀，一斤杏仁能换三、四斤粮食。我们石源村一九五三年在那个大山的阳坡种了山杏、山桃，将来山的阳坡都准备种上这东西，阴坡种上油松。别看这深山里面的小村庄，可真有个发展头。”榆（社）太（谷）造林局局长巩三纲给石源村算了个账：石源村有荒山十几架，荒山面积最少有一万亩，一亩可种六百棵山桃、山杏树，三四年就结果，每棵按收两斤果核算，每亩就可收一千二百斤桃、杏核，可换一千二百来斤粮食。一万亩山坡都种上树能收多少？整整一千多万斤粮食。段同年说：“可不能瞎过日子，谁想到这些当柴烧的野果果树会变成摇钱树呢。”
    当我们从山上回来的时候，那羊倌、牛倌也赶着牧群下山了。牛、羊脖子里的铃铛声，使人感到深山人民的快乐。现在石源村有八十头牛，二百多只羊，可是一九五○年石源村才只有三十头牛，四十只羊。没有牧畜，这里土地提高产量是难以想像的，他们山岗岗上的土地多是羊卧地，羊群越大，可使他们的粮食打得越多。如果太行山上没有大面积的林带来防止自然的灾害，多打粮食也是不可能的。
    封山育林后的石源村，现在每年仅从采松籽、砍椽、编筐、卖柴几点微小的收入里就增加三万多斤粮食的财富。这些收入使他们能向土地上投资，因此地肥了。十年后这里满山是果木林，是木材林，有牛群、羊群，别看现在不通铁轮车，到那时汽车也要来呀！又一个山村
    张志全八年没回家了。八年前他自愿地穿上军装参加了人民解放军，从山西征战到东北，从东北到中原。去年夏天他从部队里回来了，沿着浊漳河湾他却找不到自己的村庄。陌生的人们确实很难找到这个山村的，因为南村这个河套的村庄已被浊漳河边密密层层的白杨树、柳树遮蔽住了。
    南村的变化，是在最近几年间。张志全参军的时候，这里的浊漳河还宽到四五里，河边也很少树木。只要下雨，河两岸的肥沃土地就会被淹没。南村的人民还记得：十年前，浊漳河的激流漂走了他们一千亩好土地。最近几年南村栽了几十万株树后，河才慢慢窄了，并收回了一百多亩好地。南村林业合作社主任陈续仁指着那青青的麦田说：这就是我们栽树的结果，没有这样多树木，这些麦子是不可能收的。南村人民眼看着自己种植的树木长起来了。南村的每个人都从这个大林带里得到兴奋和鼓舞。我们在南村的大林带里行走时，陈续仁不断地摸摸那丈多高的白杨树，说：“你看这都能当椽材了。再等十年可出两万棵檩，三十万棵椽，那就等于几百万斤粮食呀。”还不仅这些，南村群众正以每年每人植树一百株的速度增加着。此外他们还播种了核桃树和苹果树，就是这些，把南村的群众吸住了。南村现在仅仅有两个人没有参加林业合作社。
    为南村人民欢迎的林业合作社，它所走过的道路，也并不是一帆风顺的。
    一九四九年上级号召种树的时候，南村群众也种了一些树。因为那时没有确定林权、种树时也不讲求技术，他们种的一万四千棵树，才活了九千棵。他们在浊漳河滩里造林后，选出了六十多岁的陈会德来看林，并宣布禁止放牛、羊。就这样有些群众不满起来了。羊倌说：“秋爬圪梁，夏在湾，河滩封了到那里放羊呀？”过去在河滩里拾柴的人也说拾柴也没地方了。陈会德老头子对自己村上的人还可以说服，对外村的人可实在没办法。他和云簇村的群众闹了别扭，找到区里，第二天别村的放羊的人又来了。陈会德没办法，只当没看见，可是本村的人又给他提意见，说他软的欺硬的怕。一九五○年又换了一个年轻的陈水元当林业委员。陈水元也怕得罪人，他也干脆不管了。
    树慢慢地大了。人们对树的关心也多了。不少人提出：“要是公家的，公家就管起来，要是归个人，咱们就分开。”多数人觉得老是闹乱子，不如分了好。分林的话头在南村多起来了。有些部门并选出了分林代表。南村的支部副书记陈续仁在这分林的舆论中不安起来了。他想：如果分了林，谁愿砍就砍，几年不完了吗？浊漳河还是管不住呀。党不是整天价号召群众走集体化、合作化的道路，分林不是正和党的要求相反吗？他在党员大会上这样提出了问题。南村三十多个党员都同意走合作的路，只有陈祥林不同意，多数党员都向他提出了批评，在多数党员帮助下，陈祥林作了检讨。党员中酝酿成熟后，又在群众大会上作了讨论，多数人说不分林好是好，就得认真地管起来。很多人嚷嚷着成立林业合作社。南村林业合作社就在大会上成立了，并选陈续仁为主任，林业合作社里还成立了计划股、财务股、技术股、护林股。自从林业社成立后，破坏林木的现象没有了，现在种树已成为南村群众的习惯了。他们的林区年复一年的扩大着。南村群众的经验证明，他们所从事的巨大的营造林带的工作，并不耽误农业生产，去年每人植树一百棵，两天就植完了。
    从石源村、从南村、从榆社县的许多山村中，人们看到了太行山应走的道路。
