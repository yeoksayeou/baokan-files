French Officials Felt Heartbroken

In early December of last year, when the heads of the United States, Britain, and France held a meeting in Bermuda, two interesting things happened: one was that during the inspection of troops by the heads of state, French Prime Minister Laniel's car was not arranged according to the so-called position of the three major powers. Laniel was ranked fifth, placed behind U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and British Foreign Secretary Eden; the other was that when welcoming Eisenhower's arrival, the band played the American national anthem, but when welcoming Laniel, the French national anthem "La Marseillaise" was not played.

According to news from New York, these two incidents made some members of the French delegation "heartbroken" and "puzzled." The problem is that the French Prime Minister, who was discriminated against, may not have felt any "heartbreak" or "puzzlement." Just as the French newspaper "Combat" said, "Our representative (referring to Laniel) did not even express anger at this insult. To what extent has the sense of national dignity been lost?"

Britain Could Not Remain Silent

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on December 29th of last year, when Britain and Egypt held negotiations on the Suez Canal dispute, the United States claimed that it would provide military and economic aid to the Egyptian government. This made Britain very uneasy because Britain fully understood that once Egyptian Prime Minister Naguib received American "aid," Britain's control over the Suez Canal would become even more unstable. If the strategically valuable Suez Canal fell into the hands of the United States, it would not only endanger Britain's position in the Middle East, but also cut off the lifeline of the British Empire's maritime rule over its eastern territories. Churchill, in order to cover up the growing contradictions between the United States and Britain, had instructed his subordinates to remain silent on the issue of the US-Pakistan military agreement. However, this time, the Americans had clearly touched Britain's fatal weakness, so the dissatisfaction of British officials had to be expressed.

"Cannot be Ignored"

According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on December 7th of last year, U.S. Senator McCarthy recently clamored that if any of America's "allies" traded with New China, the United States would stop its "aid" to them. After this news reached Japan, it immediately aroused dissatisfaction among people and public opinion circles in Tokyo. Some Japanese parliamentarians and businessmen said that because the dollar zone and the pound zone had built high tariff barriers, the road facing Japan was: either trade with China or face economic bankruptcy. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" stated in its editorial on December 7th of last year that it "cannot ignore" McCarthy's remarks.

"Why Don't You Like Us?"

On December 29th of last year, the British "Evening Standard" published an article by an American named Ben Duncan entitled "Why Don't You British Like Us?" The author said that the vast majority of British people genuinely dislike Americans. If anyone doesn't believe it, just try calling a hotel to book a room with an American accent. He said, "One Saturday night, I tried calling hotels in London to book a room, and I was rejected by three. A kind British friend of mine made a call for me, and the first call got a reservation." The author said that you can also ask people walking near the U.S. Embassy in London, and they will frankly tell you that given the opportunity, they would not hesitate to send all the Americans back to America. The author also said that anti-American sentiment is everywhere. Try walking into a movie theater, and when a caricature ridiculing America appears, the expressions on the audience's faces are definitely not the relaxed mood of watching a comedy.

"Get Out of Here"

According to a report in the "Pakistan Times" on December 12th of last year, Pakistani government officials once discovered an American businessman who was trying to evade income tax. When the official questioned him, the American businessman not only didn't care, but instead lectured the official in a condescending tone: You should know that even the wheat that Pakistan is eating now is a "gift" from America! The official was obviously angered by the "American friend." He said indignantly: "You and your wheat get out of here!"

    美国和他的“朋友”
    法国官员感到痛心
    去年十二月上旬，当美、英、法首脑们在百慕大举行会议时，曾发生了这样两件颇有意思的事：一件是首脑们在进行检阅时，法国总理拉尼埃的车没有按照所谓三大国领袖的位置排列，拉尼埃被排在第五位了，他竟被安置在美国国务卿杜勒斯和英国外相艾登的后面；另一件是大会在欢迎艾森豪威尔到达时，乐队奏起了美国国歌，而在欢迎拉尼埃时，却没有奏法国国歌“马赛曲”。
    据纽约的消息说，这两件事曾使法国代表团的一部分人“感到痛心”和“困惑不解”，问题是受到歧视的法国总理自己却未必感到什么“痛心”和“不解”，正像法国“战斗报”所说的“我们的代表（按指拉尼埃）甚至没有对这种侮辱表示生气，民族尊严感丧失到了什么程度了呢？”
      英国沉默不住了
    据美联社华盛顿去年十二月二十九日电讯报道，当英国与埃及就苏彝士运河纠纷举行谈判的时候，美国声称要用军事和经济援助埃及政府。这使英国非常不安起来，因为英国完全懂得：一旦埃及纳吉布总理得到了美“援”，英国对苏彝士运河的控制就会更加不稳了。如果富有战略价值的苏彝士运河落在美国手里，不仅危及英国在中东的地位，而且大英帝国在海上统治东方属地的生命线也被割断了。邱吉尔为了掩盖美英间愈来愈发展的矛盾，曾经指示他的下属，要他们对美巴军事协定问题保持沉默。但是，美国佬这一次显然触到了英国致命的痛处，所以英国官员们不满的心情，不得不形之于声色了。
        “不能漠然视之”
    据合众社东京去年十二月七日电讯报道，美国的参议员麦卡锡最近又叫嚣说：美国的“盟国”，如有那一个与新中国进行贸易，美国就要停止对它的“援助”。这个消息传到日本后，立刻引起东京人士与舆论界的不满，某些日本议员与商人说，由于美元区与英镑区建筑了高高的关税壁垒，摆在日本面前的道路是：要么与中国贸易；要么经济破产。日本资产阶级的报纸“每日新闻”在去年十二月七日的社论里表示，它对麦卡锡的谈话“不能漠然视之”。
        “为什么不喜欢我们”
    去年十二月二十九日，英国“标准晚报”刊登了一个美国人宾·邓肯的文章。题目是“你们英国人为什么不喜欢我们”？作者说，绝大部分英国人是真正不欢喜美国人的，如果有人不相信的话，只要试一下用美国口音打电话到旅馆订房间就够了。他说：“一个星期六晚上，我在伦敦试着打电话到旅馆订房间，问了三家都被谢绝了。我的一个好心肠的英国朋友替我打电话，第一个电话就订到了”。作者说，你还可以问问伦敦美国大使馆附近走路的人，他们会坦率地告诉你，只要一有机会，他们便会毫不迟疑地把所有的美国人都弄回美国去。作者还说，反美情绪，是所在皆是的，你试走进一家电影院，当嘲笑美国的丑角出台时，观众脸上的表情，绝对看不出是普通看喜剧的那种轻松的心情。
        “都给我滚开”
    据去年十二月十二日“巴基斯坦时报”报道，巴基斯坦政府的官员，一次发现了一个打算逃避所得税的美国商人，当这个官员质问时，美国商人不仅毫不在乎，反而用教训似的口吻对这个官员说：你要知道，连巴基斯坦现在吃的小麦都是美国的“赐予”啊！这个官员显然被“美国朋友”激怒了，他愤慨地说：“你和你的小麦都给我滚开”。
