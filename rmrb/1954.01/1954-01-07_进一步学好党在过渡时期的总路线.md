    Further Study of the Party's General Line for the Transition Period
    Since October of last year, cadres in various regions have been studying the Party's general line for the transition period, and this study quickly formed a surge. The vast majority of cadres participated in this study, and the Party committees and cadres in various regions attached great importance to it. Many principal responsible comrades gave reports and propaganda on the general line to the broad masses of cadres and people. According to the reflections of cadres in various regions in their work and discussions, their ideological gains in this study were extremely great. That is, they clarified the general direction of our country's gradual transition to a socialist society, and clarified the specific path of how to build our country into a great socialist country; that is, they clarified that the essence of the Party's general line in the transition period is to make the socialist ownership of the means of production the sole economic foundation of our country and society. Many departments, especially financial and economic departments, have further realized the important significance of their work, clarified the direction of development, began to criticize some of the mistakes in their past work, and greatly improved their political enthusiasm. Various manifestations of bourgeois individualism among cadres have also been criticized and overcome to some extent. In short, the study situation in the past two or three months has proved that the Party's general line for the transition period is the political foundation and banner for uniting the people of the whole country, and it illuminates the path of the people of the whole country's progress; organizing cadres to further study the general line can greatly improve the socialist consciousness of cadres and bring great impetus to work.
    In the past two or three months, some difficulties and shortcomings have also been discovered in the cadres' learning process of the general line. First of all, the learning materials on the general line are not yet complete and not very systematic. Secondly, the reports and transmissions of responsible comrades in various regions have played a very important role in the past two or three months, but because there was a lack of unified materials and outlines in the past, the content of some reports was not complete enough. For example, some reports talked very little about the most important part of the general line—gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization—some did not even mention it at all and specialized in explaining the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and some reports had the opposite content, only talking about socialist industrialization, which hindered cadres' comprehensive and correct understanding of the general line. Thirdly, many difficult problems raised in the past period of study have not been answered, and some disputes have not been resolved. Some of these problems and disputes should be left for further study, but most should and can be resolved. The failure to resolve these problems and disputes in a timely manner also hindered the progress and deepening of learning. Finally, in implementing the fundamental principle of combining theory with practice in this study, although many regions have guided and inspired cadres to link their work and their thinking in their studies, many comrades have not linked their reports to practice sufficiently. This also needs to be overcome in future studies.
    The question now is: how should the study of the general line be improved in the future? Since the study in the past period has enabled cadres to have a preliminary understanding of the content of the general line, and now that the outline for study is available, and there is experience in organizing study in the past period, we should concentrate our efforts in the next two or three months to conduct in-depth study in order to achieve greater results.
    First, we must further systematically study the content of the Party's general line for the transition period. In the past period of study, most of the content of the general line was understood in a more general way. Now, we should further study and research in detail according to the following five topics: the Party's general line for the transition period; striving for the country's socialist industrialization; gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts; gradually realizing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce; strengthening the Party's leadership and mobilizing the people of the whole country to struggle for the realization of the Party's general line for the transition period. Problems that were neglected in the past should be made up to correct the shortcomings of unsystematic and incomplete study of the general line. Naturally, it is entirely necessary to focus on the study of certain parts of the general line according to the needs of work (such as cadres in industrial departments focusing on the study of the country's socialist industrialization). However, because the Party's general line for the transition period is the most fundamental policy guiding the country's direction of progress in the next few years, its various components are not dispensable but closely related; it not only indicates the general direction of the country's progress, but also indicates the internal relations of various tasks of the country. Therefore, every cadre with a certain level of political and cultural knowledge should have a more comprehensive understanding of it, and should not neglect the parts that are less related to their own work under the pretext of "linking with reality." In the past period of study, the main focus was on listening to reports and discussions, and not enough attention was paid to studying documents. In the next two or three months, everyone should be organized to carefully read and study the documents; cadres participating in advanced and intermediate groups of theoretical study should also read relevant documents of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, read relevant parts of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union," and read relevant works of Comrade Mao Zedong. Only in this way can we deeply understand the theoretical basis of the general line. In addition, we must guide cadres to study the actual situation and problems of China's economic construction. We must criticize the erroneous view that cadres who are not in economic work positions neglect the actual situation of economic construction and think that economic construction is "irrelevant to themselves." We should organize reports on the actual situation of economic construction, compile and publish relevant reference materials, and organize on-site visits. Only in this way can we deepen cadres' understanding of the general line and mobilize all forces to strive for the realization of the general line.
    Second, we must guide cadres to use the general line as a guideline to check and improve their work. The combination of theory and practice is the fundamental principle of our learning method. The main purpose of the study in the past period was to clarify the basic content of the general line. In the future, we should use the general line as a "lighthouse" to check and illuminate our work. Many cadres felt that their eyes were brightened and their minds were clear after studying the general line. Many vague and chaotic problems in the past now have a scale of judgment and the ability to judge. This feeling proves that the general line has a huge power to guide practice. In order to obtain concrete results, this work of combining theory and practice should not be carried out piecemeal but systematically, not superficially but after analysis and consideration. This first requires the principal responsible comrades to conduct systematic analysis and research based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the spirit of the general line, combined with the actual situation and combined with work. This analysis and research should not only include a review of past work, but more importantly, put forward guidelines for improving future work. After this analysis and synthesis, reports should be made to the broad masses of cadres to guide them to further study theory, check, study and improve their work. In implementing this method, we should oppose both the error of only studying theory and not combining it with practice, and the error of purely discussing business and not combining it with theory. The method of designating responsible cadres to conduct special studies introduced by this newspaper in the news and comments published on December 12th in the Northwest District-level organs is in line with this spirit. Many local Party committees have now begun to adopt and promote the same learning method. It must be pointed out that as long as this method is adhered to, it will prove to be an effective method for improving the theoretical level of cadres and improving business work. However, the trial implementation of this method will inevitably encounter many difficulties, that is, busy work and lack of time, but the more important difficulty is the lack of a habit of studying theory and combining it with practice for such special studies in the past. Therefore, all places that have established a plan for special studies should earnestly supervise and inspect to ensure its implementation. Since this method is just beginning to be implemented, the requirements for the papers on special studies should not be too high, but should be gradually improved in future studies. As for departments that cannot implement this method for the time being, they should also conduct appropriate inspections and research in connection with their work in accordance with this spirit, by holding examinations or tests.
    Third, it is necessary to criticize the right-leaning and "left"-leaning erroneous thoughts that have been discovered in the study that violate the general line. For example, in terms of the country's socialist industrialization, there are erroneous thoughts that our country can delay industrialization, can reduce the speed of industrialization, can not focus on the development of heavy industry, that industrialization is detrimental to farmers and the general people, and that with the help of the Soviet Union, our country's industrialization is not important. On the other hand, there are also blind and impetuous ideas that require industrialization and revitalization in a very short period of time, require rapid and greatly improved people's lives, and want to do all the good things in one morning. For example, in terms of the socialist transformation of agriculture, there are ideas that farmers do not need transformation, that selling grain to the state is detrimental to farmers, and that after recognizing that farmers have a spontaneous tendency towards capitalism, they exaggerate the "backwardness" of farmers and that they are not easy to transform, and even ignore the main aspect that our farmers are reliable allies of the working class and other "left"-leaning ideas. For example, in terms of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, there are ideas that the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce will not encounter any difficulties and obstacles, that there is no complicated and sharp class struggle in the transition period, or that the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is too "troublesome." In addition to criticizing these erroneous views, we must also focus on criticizing various manifestations of bourgeois ideology among cadres, and further draw a clear line between the ideology of the working class and the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie among cadres. This requires severely criticizing any decentralism and individualism that weakens the Party's leadership, and thoroughly correcting the participation of Party member cadres in commercial speculation, lending at high interest rates, and all other capitalist exploitative behaviors and exploitative ideas. We must greatly improve the socialist consciousness of every cadre in the study of the general line. In short, due to the further clarification of the general line, it has brought new and arduous tasks to the ideological front. With the development of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, we must vigorously strengthen the education of cadres to fight against bourgeois ideology. If we do not strengthen the Marxist-Leninist ideological education of cadres and do not strengthen the fight against the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, it will be impossible to realize the general line.
    The Party committees and departments in charge of theoretical study for leading cadres in various regions must deeply understand the extremely important significance of this study, prevent and overcome the complacent mood of cadres who think that "they have learned almost enough," and must point out to them that the content of the general line is extremely rich, and it will become richer as our country's economic construction progresses. Therefore, we must earnestly and deeply study it, and continue to study it in the long term in the future. The Party committees and departments in charge of theoretical study for leading cadres in various regions must also seize the time in these two or three months, strengthen ideological leadership and organizational leadership, so that this study can achieve the greatest effect.

### 进一步学好党在过渡时期的总路线

    进一步学好党在过渡时期的总路线
    各地干部从去年十月开始学习党在过渡时期的总路线，这一学习很快就形成了热潮。绝大多数的干部都参加了这一学习，各地党委和干部对这一学习都很重视，许多主要负责同志都向广大干部和人民群众做了总路线的报告和宣传。根据各地干部在工作中和讨论中的反映，他们在这一学习中思想上的收获是极大的，这就是明确了今天我们国家逐步过渡到社会主义社会去的总方针，明确了如何把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的具体道路；这就是明确了党在过渡时期总路线的实质就是要使生产资料的社会主义所有制成为我们国家和社会的唯一的经济基础。许多部门特别是财经部门的干部由此进一步认识到自己工作的重要意义，明确了发展的方向，开始批判了过去工作中的某些错误，并大大提高了自己政治上的积极性。干部中各种各样的资产阶级个人主义的思想表现也得到了某些批判和克服。总之，两三个月来学习的情况证明，党在过渡时期的总路线是团结全国人民的政治基础和旗帜，它照耀着全国人民的前进的道路；组织干部进一步学好总路线，就能够大大提高干部的社会主义觉悟，就能给工作带来极大的推动力。
    在过去两三个月，干部对总路线学习进程中也发现了若干困难和缺点。首先，关于总路线的学习材料还不很完备，不很有系统。其次，在过去两三个月内各地负责同志的报告和传达曾起了非常重要的作用，但是由于过去缺少统一的材料和提纲，有些报告的内容是不够完备的，例如有些报告中对总路线中最主要的部分——逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化讲得很少，有的甚至完全不提而专门讲解对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，有的报告内容又与此相反，只讲社会主义工业化，这都妨碍干部对总路线的全面的正确理解。再次，过去这一时期学习中提出了许多疑难问题未得到解答，也有若干争论还未解决。这些问题和争论，固然有些应该留待继续研究，但多数仍是应该并可能加以解决的。由于这些问题和争论没有及时解决，也妨碍了学习的前进和深入。最后，在贯彻理论和实际结合这一学习的根本原则上，虽然许多地区都已引导和启发干部在学习中联系工作、联系思想，但也有许多同志在作报告时联系实际不够。这也是要在今后学习中加以克服的。
    现在的问题是：今后对总路线的学习应该如何提高一步？既然过去这一时期的学习已经使干部对总路线的内容有了初步的理解，而且，现在学习的提纲已经有了，又有了过去这一时期组织学习的经验，所以，应该在今后两三个月内集中力量，深入进行学习以便收到更大的成效。
    第一，必须进一步有系统地钻研党在过渡时期总路线的内容。过去这一时期的学习，多半是把总路线的内容做了较概括的了解，现在就应该按照以下五个题目，即党在过渡时期的总路线；为国家的社会主义工业化而斗争；逐步实现国家对农业和手工业的社会主义改造；逐步实现国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造；加强党的领导、动员全国人民为实现党在过渡时期的总路线而奋斗等，分开做进一步详细的学习和研究。应该把过去所忽略的问题进行补课，以纠正对总路线的学习不系统、不全面的缺点。自然，由于工作业务的需要，对总路线的某些部分做着重的研究（如工业部门的干部着重研究国家的社会主义工业化问题），是完全必要的，但是，因为党在过渡时期的总路线是指导国家今后若干年内前进方向的最根本的政策，它的各个组成部分不是可有可无而是有着密切联系的；它不仅指示出国家前进的总的方向，还指示出国家各种工作的内部的关系，因此，每一个具有一定政治文化水平的干部，都应该对它有较全面的理解，不能借口
  “联系实际”而忽视学习和自己业务关系较少的部分。过去这一时期的学习主要是听报告和座谈，对文件的钻研不够，今后两三个月内，应组织大家认真阅读和钻研文件；参加理论学习高级和中级组的干部，还应该联系阅读若干马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的有关文件，阅读“联共（布）党史”的有关部分，阅读毛泽东同志的有关著作。只有如此，才能较深刻地弄清楚总路线的理论根据。除此之外，还必须引导干部研究中国经济建设的实际情况和问题。必须批判那种不在经济工作岗位上的干部忽视经济建设实际情况、认为经济建设“与己无关”的错误观点。应该分别组织有关经济建设实际情况的报告，编刊有关的参考资料，组织实地的参观，只有这样才能加深干部对总路线的理解，并动员一切力量为总路线的实现而努力。
    第二，必须引导干部用总路线做方针来检查和改进自己的工作。理论和实际结合，是我们学习方法的根本原则。过去一个时期的学习主要是为了弄清楚总路线的基本内容，今后就应该以总路线这一
  “灯塔”来检查并照耀自己的工作。许多干部在学了总路线之后，感到眼睛亮了，头脑清楚了，过去许多模糊混乱的问题，现在有了判别的尺度和判别的能力了。这种感觉证明总路线具有指导实际的巨大力量。为了获得具体的成效，这种理论和实际结合的工作，应该不是零碎地而是较有系统地、不是浮光掠影地而是经过分析和考虑地来进行，这就首先要求主要负责同志，根据马克思列宁主义的理论和总路线的精神，结合实际情况，结合工作业务，进行系统地分析和研究，这种分析和研究不仅应包括对过去工作的检查，更重要的是提出改进今后工作的方针，经过这种分析和综合的工作，然后向广大干部做报告，引导他们进一步地学习理论、检查、研究和改进工作。实行这种方法，既应反对只学理论不结合实际的错误，又应反对单纯讨论业务不结合理论的错误。本报在十二月十二日发表新闻和评论所介绍的西北区级机关指定负责干部进行专题研究的方法，就是符合这一精神的。现在许多地方党委已经开始采用并推行同样的学习方法。必须指出，只要坚持实行这一方法，必将证明是提高干部理论水平、改进业务工作的有效方法。但是，试行这一方法必将遇到许多困难，这就是工作繁忙、时间缺少，但更重要的困难，还是过去缺少研究理论和结合实际进行这种专题研究的习惯。因此，凡已订立作专题研究计划的地方，应该认真督促检查，务求实现。这种办法既是开始推行，因此对专题研究的论文不要要求太高，而应在今后学习中逐步提高。至于暂时还不能实行这种方法的部门，也应根据这一精神，举行考试或测验，或联系工作进行适当的检查和研究。
    第三，必须批判在学习中已经发现的违反总路线的右倾和“左”倾的错误思想。例如，在国家的社会主义工业化方面，认为我国可以不忙工业化，可以降低工业化的速度，可以不以发展重工业为中心，认为工业化对农民和一般人民不利，认为有了苏联的援助，我国的工业化就不重要等错误思想；另一方面也存在着要求在很短时间内就实现工业化和百废俱兴、要求迅速地大大改善人民生活，在一个早上把一切好事都办完的盲目冒进思想。例如，在对农业的社会主义改造方面，存在着认为农民不需要改造、认为粮食卖给国家对农民不利的思想，和在认识到农民具有自发的资本主义倾向之后就夸大农民的“落后”和不好改造，甚至忽略我国农民是工人阶级可靠的同盟军的这一个主要方面等“左”倾的思想。例如，在对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造方面，认为资本主义工商业的改造不会遇到任何困难和阻碍，认为过渡时期没有什么复杂的尖锐的阶级斗争的思想，或者认为对资本主义工商业改造太“麻烦”等思想。除了批判这些错误观点，还必须着重批判干部中资产阶级思想的各种各样的表现，进一步在干部中划清工人阶级和资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想界限。这就必须严肃批判任何削弱党的领导的分散主义、个人主义的思想，必须彻底纠正党员干部参加商业投机、放高利贷、以及其他
  一切资本主义的剥削行为和剥削思想。必须使每个干部在总路线的学习中大大提高自己的社会主义觉悟。总之，由于总路线的进一步的明确化，就给思想战线带来新的繁重的工作任务，随着对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的发展，必须大力加强教育干部对资产阶级思想进行斗争。如果不加强干部的马克思列宁主义思想教育，不加强反对资产阶级的思想影响，要实现总路线是不可能的。
    各地党委和领导干部理论学习的部门，都必须深刻认识这一学习的极重要的意义，防止和克服干部中那种认为“已经学得差不多了”的自满情绪，必须向他们指出：总路线的内容是极为丰富的，它
  并将随着我国经济建设事业的进展而更丰富，因此，必须认真地深入学习，并在将来长时期内继续不断地进行研究。各地党委和领导干部理论学习的部门，也必须抓紧这两三个月的时间，加强思想领导和组织领导，使这一学习获得最大的效果。
