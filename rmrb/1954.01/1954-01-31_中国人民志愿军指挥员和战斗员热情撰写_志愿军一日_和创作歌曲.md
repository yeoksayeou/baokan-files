    “志愿军一日”是中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员记述自己在伟大斗争中的经历为题材的作品。它的内容分为：战士们可选择在自己的战斗生活中最突出、意义最大的一个片断经历写“最值得纪念的一天”或“最难忘的一天”；干部可写比较完整而又最值得纪念的事；高级干部可再扩大写一个工作，一个战斗，或写某一阶段某一斗争的胜利。写作的形式可采用日记、报告、通讯、诗歌、快板、小说、剧本等。
    歌曲的内容分为歌唱英雄的各个兵种，歌唱英雄的单位、阵地和出色的战斗，歌唱各方面的战斗生活，如运输小唱、坑道小唱、阵地生活小唱等，形式可采取为战士们所喜爱的小唱、对口唱、独唱及故事联唱、合唱等。
    中国人民志愿军领导机关对这一工作极为重视。中国人民志愿军政治部曾先后发出广泛开展这一工作的指示，并决定把选出来的作品，或印制专册，或在志愿军政治部出版的“志愿军战士”杂志上发表，并将把优秀的作品推荐给“解放军文艺”、“解放军歌曲选”及其他国内各种报纸刊物刊用。　　　（新华社）
