What I Saw of Military Dependents

　　First Time Responding to the Challenge
    It was late at night. The rooster outside the window had already crowed for the first time. However, Xiong Fengtao was still writing a letter. I saw her writing in a crooked manner: "Brother Liwa: If Chairman Mao hadn't enlightened me, my stubborn mind wouldn't have been able to turn around for a while. Now, I know that farming and fighting the soil are also participating in our country's socialist construction. It's not too late to respond to your challenge now. From today onwards, let's see who contributes more strength to the motherland!..."
    Xiong Fengtao is from Mingqi Township, Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, a 21-year-old rural woman who married Sun Liwa, a fellow villager, in 1951. Soon after, she sent her husband to join the Volunteer Army, and all the work at home fell on her shoulders. Later, she was elected as the secretary of the township's Communist Youth League branch and honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party.
    But at that time, she had a confused idea, always feeling that to participate in the construction of the motherland, one had to enter factories and mines, and that farming in the countryside was not very energetic. Therefore, when she received the challenge letter from her husband from the front line, she didn't know how to respond. She always thought that one day she would strive to be a worker.
    After listening to the propaganda and study of the general line of the state's transition period, her mind gradually opened up. She said, "Our peasants are still a big helper to the working class brothers!" She immediately sold her surplus grain of 600 catties to the state and promoted the idea that all farmers should participate in socialist construction to the farmers in the township.
    On December 1st last year, she was so excited that she didn't sleep well all night, and wrote her thoughts to her husband, responding to his challenge for the first time!

### 第一次应战

　　第一次应战
    夜很深了。窗外的鸡子，已叫了第一遍。可是，熊凤桃还在写信，只见她歪歪扭扭地写着：“礼娃哥：要不是毛主席点穿我，我这个死脑筋一时还转不过来。现在，我才知道种地打土也是参加咱们国家的社会主义建设。现在，和你应战也不迟。从今天起，看谁为祖国出的力量大吧！……”
    熊凤桃是湖北省汉川县明启乡人，一个二十一岁的农村妇女，一九五一年和同乡的孙礼娃结了婚。不久她送自己的丈夫参加了志愿军，家里的活全落在她一人身上了。后来她又被选为乡里的团支部书记，并光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    但那时她有个糊涂思想，总觉得要参加祖国建设，就要进工厂，上矿山，光在农村种地劲头不大。所以，她接到丈夫从前线寄来的挑战书时，就不知道自己该怎样应战。老想着有一天总要争取当个工人才算。
    听了国家过渡时期总路线的宣传和学习以后，她心里慢慢开朗了。她说：“咱们农民还是工人老大哥的一只大帮手呢！”马上把自己的余粮六百斤，卖给了国家，并向全乡农民宣传农民都要参加社会主义建设的道理。
    去年十二月一日，她兴奋得一夜没有睡好觉，把自己的心思写给了自己的丈夫，第一次和丈夫应战了！
