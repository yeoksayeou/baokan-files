Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, sent a telegram to all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army's land, sea, and air forces on New Year's Eve of 1953 to congratulate them on the New Year.

The telegram said: 1953 was a year of victory for the peace-loving forces of the world. The heroic Korean People's Army, with the warm sympathy and support of fraternal countries headed by the great Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, fought shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, defeated the armed aggression of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and ended our just war of liberation for the freedom and independence of the motherland with a great victory.

The telegram continued: Today, US imperialism and its lackey, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, are not learning from their defeat and are doing everything possible to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and are plotting a series of new aggressive schemes. Under such circumstances, all officers and soldiers of the People's Army must maintain a high degree of vigilance to monitor every move of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and further improve the quality of military and political training, so that our People's Army can be further trained into a modern regular army.

Soldiers, non-commissioned officers, and all military personnel! Give play to patriotic enthusiasm, devote all efforts to improving military skills, become familiar with your weapons, and maintain and strengthen the military discipline and high degree of organization of the iron-like troops.

All commanders! Constantly improve the art of leadership in educating subordinates, and actively study and absorb the advanced Soviet military science and the experience of the Fatherland Liberation War.

The telegram concluded: I am confident that all officers and soldiers of our People's Army will achieve new results in actively implementing all the military tasks put forward to the troops in 1954, and in firmly defending the peaceful construction of our people and striving for the great cause of the unification and independence of our motherland.
