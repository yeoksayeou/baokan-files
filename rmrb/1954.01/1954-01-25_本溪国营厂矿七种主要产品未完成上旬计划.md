Benxi State-Owned Factories and Mines Fail to Meet Early Ten-Day Plan for Seven Major Products
    Of the fifteen major products of the Benxi State-owned factories and mines, eight products, including steel ingots, Nanfen iron ore, ammonium sulfate, sulfuric acid, refined powder, lean powder, cement, and coke, have completed the production plan for the first ten days of January. However, seven products, including pig iron, rolled steel, forged steel, Bapanling iron ore, agglomerated ore, sintering, and raw coal, have not completed the early ten-day plan. The main reasons for the failure to complete the plan are: Since the New Year, the leadership of some units has not been actively involved in production. Individual leading cadres mistakenly believe that "the New Year has just begun, there is plenty of time, and it doesn't matter if it's a little behind for the first few days." Some employees believe that the relaxed-first-then-tight production schedule is an "old rule" of many years, so they show varying degrees of slackness. Some factories have also been affected by failures to complete production plans due to neglecting equipment maintenance and repair, technical management, and planning management, resulting in many accidents. For example, due to lax technical management in the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's blast furnace workshop, a material collapse accident occurred in No. 2 blast furnace on January 1, and there were many other mechanical accidents. There was also a lack of spare parts during maintenance. The forging workshop, due to neglecting equipment inspection, experienced a ring expansion rupture accident on a certain steam hammer on January 9, which halted production for one day. The rolling mill workshop was unable to produce according to plan every day since the beginning of January because the factory neglected the preparation of semi-finished products; the work plan was not drawn up until the 5th of this month. The chemical workshop, due to neglecting the supervision and inspection of production, reversed the phase sequence of the lines when changing the power supply on January 1, causing the blower to stop, which affected the coking workshop and reduced the output of six kilns of coke, and almost caused a shutdown accident in the blast furnace. These situations are all reasons for the failure to complete the production plan.

    本溪国营厂矿七种主要产品未完成上旬计划
    本溪市国营厂矿十五种主要产品中，除钢锭、南芬铁矿石、硫安、硫酸、精选粉、贫选粉、水泥、焦炭等八种产品已完成了一月上旬的生产计划外，尚有生铁、轧钢材、锻钢材、八盘岭铁矿石、团矿、烧结、原煤等七种产品没有完成上旬计划。没有完成的主要原因是：自新年以来，有些单位的领导上对生产没有抓紧，个别领导干部错误地认为“新年刚过，来日方长，头几天差一点不要紧”。某些职工认为生产的前松后紧是多年的“老规矩”了，因而不同程度地呈现了松劲思想。有些工厂则由于忽视设备的维护检修、技术管理和计划管理，因而发生许多事故，也在不同程度上影响了生产。例如本溪钢铁公司高炉车间由于技术管理不严，一月一日二号高炉曾发生崩料事故，其他机械事故也很多，检修时又缺少备品；锻造车间由于忽视设备检查工作，一月九日某号汽锤发生涨圈破裂事故，曾停止了一天生产；轧钢车间因为厂方忽视半成品的准备工作，自一月上旬以来每天均不能按计划生产，作业计划直到本月五日才编制出来；化学车间由于忽视生产的监督检查工作，在一月一日那天更换电源时，将线路的相次搞错，鼓风机停转，曾影响炼焦车间少出六窑焦炭，并几乎给高炉造成休风事故。这些情况，都是造成生产计划完不成的原因。
