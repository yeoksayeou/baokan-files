Strengthen Production and Disaster Relief Work in Accordance with the General Line of the State

Over the past few years, governments at all levels have used tremendous manpower, materials, and financial resources to carry out disaster prevention and relief work to help farmers develop production and overcome natural disasters. Many places have built various large and small water conservancy projects, cultivated many protective forest belts, developed mutual aid and cooperation, improved farming methods, and used new agricultural technologies, thereby greatly enhancing agriculture's ability to resist disasters. In addition, after disasters occurred, governments at all levels correctly implemented the policy of production for disaster relief, actively led the work of production for disaster relief, and distributed relief grain and funds (over the past four years, the central government alone has allocated more than 42.7 trillion yuan), and reduced or exempted agricultural taxes, thus disasters have been reduced year by year, and agricultural production has been restored and developed.

However, due to various conditions, it is impossible for our country to comprehensively harness rivers in a short period, to rapidly complete various water conservancy constructions, and to plant forests and protective forest belts on a large scale to eradicate floods and droughts; nor is it possible to produce and use a large number of pesticides and machinery to eradicate various diseases and insect pests; although mutual aid and cooperative organizations have greatly developed, the individual small-scale peasant economy still dominates the countryside. Individual farmers find it difficult to carry out basic agricultural construction to enhance the land's ability to resist disasters, and it is also difficult to overcome disasters independently after disasters occur. These basic circumstances determine that natural disasters cannot be completely avoided for a considerable period of time. Therefore, we must establish a long-term concept of disaster prevention and relief and oppose blind optimism and carelessness. Especially in areas that suffered from floods, droughts, frosts, and other disasters in 1953, we should make production for self-relief and prevention of spring famine our primary tasks.

After reviewing past work based on the general line of the state, the Second National Civil Affairs Conference made new arrangements for future production and disaster relief work. Recently, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government also issued instructions on carrying out winter production for self-relief work in disaster areas to prevent spring famine. All localities must check past disaster relief work in accordance with the spirit of the general line and this instruction, and conscientiously organize disaster-stricken masses to engage in production for self-relief.

According to the experience of various places, whether for disaster prevention or relief, we should take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Mutual aid and cooperation are the fundamental methods for the state to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, and also an effective step to overcome disasters. Farmers have experienced in the past four years of fighting against natural disasters that organizing can uniformly allocate labor, use new agricultural tools, improve soil, and increase agricultural output; in resisting natural disasters, it has its special advantages compared with individual households. Taking the Litian Shu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tielou Township, Mengjin County, Henan Province as an example, the township suffered from continuous rain disasters in 1953, and the land of ordinary individual households was reduced due to the disaster, but only the land of the Litian Shu Agricultural Production Cooperative was not only not reduced but also gained a bumper harvest. The main reason is that the cooperative has more people, is organized, and can organize all the full labor and semi-labor according to different labor conditions to various productions; and can also adjust manpower in time according to seasonal and climatic changes to meet urgent needs. Individual households often lose sight of one thing while attending to another, affecting harvests. Some mutual aid and cooperative organizations in disaster areas can also engage in sideline production, and can always do both agriculture and sideline production throughout the year. Farmers have more income and stronger ability to resist disasters. Even if they suffer disasters, they can overcome difficulties and defeat disasters. In some places, farmers have organized temporary shock-type mutual aid organizations to rescue disaster-stricken crops, which is also very effective. In the autumn of 1953, some areas of Hebei Province suffered from floods. The tasks of drainage and salvaging the remaining autumn and planting wheat were very heavy, but because the masses were organized (according to statistics from 230 villages in nine counties alone, 4,053 temporary mutual aid groups were developed), the difficulty of insufficient labor was solved. Not only was the work of drainage and salvaging the remaining autumn done well, but also the wheat planting plan was overfulfilled. Therefore, the staff in the disaster area must use various examples to publicize the role of mutual aid and cooperative organizations in production and disaster relief work to the farmers in the disaster area, and vigorously help them organize and give play to the potential of disaster resistance.

In the disaster relief work over the years, various places have found that speculators and usurers cruelly exploited the victims by means of grain speculation, buying green seedlings, and lending usury, taking advantage of people's difficulties and disrupting the disaster relief work. In the spring of 1953, after the frost disaster occurred in northern Anhui and northern Henan, due to the rumors and misleading speculation of unscrupulous merchants, a situation of grain shortage was once created. This situation was not changed until the state transported 1.9 billion catties of grain to the local market. Therefore, in the future disaster relief work, we must pay high attention to this, and must stop the activities of grain speculators and stop the phenomenon of buying and selling green seedlings. Banks and cooperative departments should strengthen credit loan business to help farmers get rid of the exploitation of usury. In particular, we must organize disaster victims in mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the direction indicated by the general line, and use various production methods, rather than engage in commercial speculation, to tide over disasters. Vigorously organizing disaster victims to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations can effectively overcome disasters, enhance the masses' ability to resist disasters to prevent disasters from happening, and realize the state's gradual socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts in disaster areas.

In areas where disasters have already occurred, organizing the masses to engage in sideline production is of particular importance. But sideline production must be planned. Implementing a contract system for the supply and marketing of sideline products is an effective method to strengthen planning. By signing supply and marketing contracts, clear provisions can be made on the specifications of the products, and different quantities and prices of different products can be stipulated according to the needs of the market, so as to avoid blind production by the disaster victims, resulting in excessive products, or non-compliance with specifications, resulting in serious unsalable phenomena. In the spring of 1953, disaster victims in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and other provinces had a large number of unsalable products because the contract system was not implemented. This is a great loss for the disaster victims and the country. Therefore, the cooperative and trade departments should regard the implementation of the contract system as a lever to guide disaster victims to carry out sideline production in a planned way, and often check whether the sideline production of disaster victims has fulfilled the provisions of the contract, and correct deviations in time. In order to do this work well, Hebei Province has sent a large number of cadres from cooperatives to participate in material exchange conferences in major cities and relevant departments to find a way out for the sideline production of disaster victims. It has now signed sideline production contracts worth more than 260 billion yuan. This practice is worthy of emulation in various places. However, when organizing disaster victims to engage in sideline production, it must be noted to educate the disaster victims not to engage in commercial speculation, especially not to engage in activities such as trafficking in grain and developing towards the capitalist road.

The state's distribution of relief grain and funds is an important measure to help disaster victims carry out production for self-relief. We should make this work truly play a role in encouraging the enthusiasm of disaster victims for production and organizing disaster victims for production. Some cadres do not have enough understanding of this, and hope to simply support all households with living difficulties with relief grain and funds from the government, without paying attention to organizing disaster victims to produce for self-relief; blindly and indiscriminately distribute or equally distribute relief grain and funds, and even often provide simple relief to lazy people. This practice can only encourage the psychology of disaster victims not to engage in production and simply rely on relief. Therefore, when distributing relief grain and funds, we must realistically grasp the disaster situation, explain the significance of distributing relief grain and funds to the masses, and distribute the grain and funds to the disaster victims who must be relieved through democratic evaluation. Relief grain and funds should be distributed as concentrated as possible in order to organize disaster victims to carry out production, so that relief grain and funds can play a role in promoting production.

While organizing disaster victims to carry out production, we must call on disaster victims to save food and clothing in order to expand reproduction and enhance the strength of famine preparation, and pay special attention to saving grain, replacing fine grain with coarse grain, and replacing grain with substitutes as much as possible. Many places have experience in this area and should be promoted.

Whether disaster relief work is done well or not has a significant impact not only on the lives and production of the people in the disaster area, but also on the entire national construction cause. The staff in the disaster area not only has a great responsibility to the people in the disaster area, but also has a great responsibility to the people of the whole country. Their task is not only to generally organize disaster victims to produce for self-relief, but also to carry out the work of educating and organizing disaster victims to take the socialist road in disaster relief work, develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and gradually implement the state's socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts. Only in this way can the implementation of the country's various construction plans not be difficult due to the invasion of natural disasters on agriculture. Production and disaster relief work is the decisive work in the disaster area, which is closely related to the work of farmland, water conservancy, finance, transportation, trade, cooperation, banks and other departments. Therefore, party committees at all levels in the disaster area must firmly grasp the leadership of production and disaster relief work, and regard production and disaster relief work as the overriding central task. Around this central task, make appropriate arrangements for various tasks and achieve organic cooperation between various departments. The civil affairs department should also do a good job in the office of the production and disaster relief committee, distribute relief grain and funds in a timely manner, check the implementation of production and disaster relief policies, and ensure the smooth progress of production and disaster relief work.

### 按照国家总路线加强生产救灾工作

    按照国家总路线
    加强生产救灾工作
    各级人民政府为了帮助农民发展生产、战胜自然灾害，几年来曾用巨大的人力、物力、财力进行了防灾救灾的工作。许多地方兴修了各种大小水利，培植了许多防护林带，发展了互助合作，改良了耕作方法，使用了新的农业技术，因而使农业的抗灾力量大大增强。加以在灾荒发生之后，各级人民政府正确贯彻生产救灾政策，积极领导生产救灾工作，发放救济粮款（四年来仅从中央即拨发了四万二千七百余亿元），减免农业税，因而灾荒已逐年减轻，农业生产得到恢复和发展。
    但是，由于各种条件的限制，我国在短时期内还不可能全面根治河流，不可能迅速完成各项水利建设，大规模培植森林和防护林带，以根除水患和旱灾；也不可能大量生产和使用杀虫农药械，以根治各种病虫害；而互助合作组织虽有很大发展，但个体小农经济在农村中仍占优势，个体农民既难于进行农业的基本建设，以增强土地的抗灾力，在灾荒发生之后，也难于独自战胜灾荒。这些基本情况决定了在相当长的时期以内，自然灾害还是不能完全避免。因此我们必须树立长远的防灾救灾观念，反对盲目乐观、麻痹大意。尤其在一九五三年遭受水灾、旱灾、霜灾和其他灾害的地区，更应该以作好生产自救工作、预防春荒为首要的任务。
    第二次全国民政会议在依据国家总路线检查了过去的工作以后，对今后的生产救灾工作作了新的部署。最近中央人民政府内务部又发布了关于开展灾区冬季生产自救工作预防春荒的指示。各地必须按照总路线和这一指示的精神，来检查过去的救灾工作，认真组织受灾群众生产自救。
    根据各地经验，无论防灾或救灾，都应该走互助合作的道路。互助合作是国家对农业进行社会主义改造的根本方法，也是战胜灾荒的有效步骤。农民在四年来与自然灾害作斗争中已经体验到，组织起来能够统一调配劳动力，能够使用新式农具，改良土壤，提高农业产量；在抵抗自然灾害方面，较之单干户有它特殊的优越性。以河南省孟津县铁楼乡李天树农业生产合作社为例，这乡一九五三年阴雨成灾，一般单干户的土地都因遭灾而减产，唯有李天树农业生产合作社的土地不仅没有减产，而且得到丰收。主要原因，是合作社人多，有组织，能把所有的全劳力和半劳力依据不同的劳动条件，组织到各种生产上去；并能根据季节和气候的变化，及时调配人力，应付急需。单干户则常常顾此失彼，影响收成。有些灾区的互助合作组织能兼营副业生产，能常年做到农业副业两不误，农民收入更多，抗灾能力也更强。即使遭灾，也能够克服困难战胜灾荒。有些地方的农民为了抢救遭灾农作物而组织了临时突击性质的互助组织，也十分有效。一九五三年秋季河北省部分地区遭受水灾，排水和打捞残秋、种麦的任务非常繁重，但由于群众组织起来（仅据九个县二百三十个村的统计，就发展了四千零五十三个临时互助组），解决了劳动力不足的困难，不但做好排水和打捞残秋的工作，并且超额完成了种麦计划。因此，灾区的工作人员必须以各种实例向灾区农民宣传互助合作组织在生产救灾工作中的作用，大力帮助他们组织起来，发挥抗灾的潜力。
    历年来的救灾工作中，各地都曾发现投机商人和高利贷者以粮食投机、买青苗、放高利贷等手段乘人之危残酷盘剥灾民，破坏救灾工作。一九五三年春天皖北、豫北发生霜灾后，由于奸商造谣惑众，投机套购，一度造成粮食脱销局势。直到国家运往当地市场十九亿斤粮食之后，才改变这种情况。因此，在今后的救灾工作中，我们对此必须引起高度的注意，必须制止粮食投机商人的活动，制止买卖青苗的现象。银行、合作部门，应当加强信用贷款业务，帮助农民摆脱高利贷的剥削。特别是必须按照总路线指示的方向，把灾民组织在互助合作组织中，用各种生产的办法，而不是从事商业投机活动的办法，来渡过灾荒。大力组织灾民参加互助合作组织，才能有效地战胜灾荒，才能增强群众的抗灾能力以防止灾荒的发生，也才能实现国家对灾区农业和手工业的社会主义的逐步改造。
    在已经发生灾荒的地区，组织群众进行副业生产具有特殊的重要性。但副业生产必须有计划。实行副业产品供销合同制度，则是加强计划性的有效方法。通过订立供销合同，可以对产品的规格作出明确的规定，可以根据市场的需要，规定不同产品的不同数量和价格，以避免灾民盲目生产，发生产品过剩，或不合规格，以致造成严重滞销的现象。一九五三年春季江苏、安徽、湖北等省灾民，因未实行合同制，曾滞销大批产品。这对灾民，对国家，都是很大的损失。因此，合作、贸易部门应该把实行合同制看作指导灾民有计划地进行副业生产的杠杆，并经常检查灾民的副业生产是否履行了合同的规定，及时纠正偏差。河北省为了作好这一工作，合作社曾派出大批干部到各重要城市和有关部门参加物资交流大会，为灾民的副业生产寻找出路，现已签订价值二千六百余亿元的副业生产合同。这种作法值得各地效法。但在组织灾民进行副业生产时，必须注意教育灾民不要从事商业投机、特别是不要做贩运粮食等向资本主义道路发展的活动。
    国家发放救济粮款，是帮助灾民进行生产自救的一项重要措施。我们应该使这一工作真正起到鼓励灾民生产积极性和组织灾民生产的作用。有些干部对此认识不足，希望简单地把一切生活困难户都由政府用救济粮款养活起来，不注意组织灾民生产自救；对救济粮款实行盲目滥发或平均发放，甚至对懒汉也经常施以单纯救济。这种作法，只能助长灾民不事生产、单纯依靠救济的心理。因此，在发放救济粮款时，必须切实掌握灾情，向群众说明发放救济粮款的意义，经过民主评议，把粮款发放给必须救济的灾民。救济粮款应该尽量集中发放，以便组织灾民进行生产，使救济粮款起到推动生产的作用。
    在组织灾民进行生产的同时，必须号召灾民为了扩大再生产、增强备荒力量而省吃俭用，特别要注意节约粮食，以细粮换粗粮，多以代食品代替粮食。许多地方在这一方面已有经验，应加以推广。
    救灾工作作得好坏，不仅对灾区人民的生活和生产有重大影响，对整个国家建设事业也有很大关系。灾区的工作人员不仅是对灾区人民负有重大的责任，而且对全国人民负有重大的责任。他们的任务不仅是一般地组织灾民生产自救，而且应该在救灾工作中对灾民进行走社会主义道路的教育工作和组织工作，发展互助合作运动，逐步地实行国家对于农业和手工业的社会主义改造。只有这样，才能使国家的各项建设计划的实施不致因自然灾害对农业的侵袭而发生困难。生产救灾工作是灾区决定一切的工作，它与农田、水利、财政、交通、贸易、合作、银行等部门的工作密切相关。因此，灾区的各级党委必须抓紧对生产救灾工作的领导，把生产救灾工作当作压倒一切的中心任务。围绕这一中心任务，把各项工作加以适当的安排，作到各部门有机配合。民政部门更应作好生产救灾委员会办公室的工作，及时发放救济粮款，检查生产救灾政策的执行情况，保证生产救灾工作顺利进行。
