    The fuel industry system under the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government has exceeded its 1953 production increase and economy task, accumulating 1,052 billion yuan for the country (excluding savings from basic construction units), exceeding the original plan by 76.4%. The coal mining system exceeded the original production increase and economy plan by 219.9%, the power system exceeded the original plan by 34.8%, and the petroleum system exceeded the original plan by 55.6%.
    The achievements of the fuel industry system's production increase and economy campaign in 1953 were significant. The main reasons for achieving the above results were that the ministry and its various professional management bureaus focused their efforts and carried out the following tasks:
    (1) Changed the leadership style. At the beginning of the production increase and economy campaign, leaders at all levels of the fuel industry system went deep into factories and mines to provide concrete assistance. They adopted methods such as calculating the big picture and mobilizing the masses to calculate detailed accounts, identified prominent problems and weak links in enterprises, and led workers and technicians to find solutions and take various measures to change the backward situation. In the early stages of the campaign, four out of the five bureau chiefs of the North China Coal Mining Administration were helping with work in the mining bureaus. The deputy director of the Central South Coal Mining Administration helped the Pingxiang Mining Bureau formulate production increase and economy plans and measures, and after gaining experience, promoted it to other mining bureaus. Cadres at the factory and mine level in the coal, electricity, and petroleum industries also reversed the past work style of holding too many meetings, not going deep into the field, and being overwhelmed and passive, which powerfully promoted the smooth development of the production increase and economy campaign.
    (2) Grasped the central link of planned management. Leaders at all levels clarified that production increase and economy is detailed and regular work, and it must be closely integrated with the current central work to develop healthily. Therefore, most factories and mines strengthened the leadership of dispatching work, strengthened institutions, equipped them with relatively strong cadres, and under leadership gradually implemented operation plans, incorporating production increase and economy plans into the operation plans. The Fuxin Mining Bureau promoted operation plans in Ping'an No. 1 Mine and the Haizhou Open-pit Transportation Section and then promoted it to the entire bureau. By November, 60% of the teams in various bureaus and mines in North China had incorporated production increase and economy plans into the operation plans. In October, 18 out of 37 coal extraction faces in the Huainan Mining Bureau implemented operation plans, resulting in over-fulfillment of production and efficiency targets. In terms of power technology management, various bureaus and factories generally emphasized "equipment appraisal," "equipment defect inspection," and planned maintenance, which played a significant role in ensuring safe power supply. The Yumen Mining Bureau and the No. 1, No. 6, and No. 7 Petroleum Factories established a global and factory-wide dispatch network, and some units also established a daily inspection system for the implementation of production operation plans, further transforming the dispatching work from passive to active, ensuring balanced production.
    (3) Vigorously promoted advanced experience and fully leveraged the wisdom of the masses. Facts have proven that only by doing these two tasks well can we more powerfully guarantee the completion and over-fulfillment of production increase and economy tasks. In the early stages of the production increase and economy campaign, various bureaus, factories, and mines successively established a dedicated system for promoting advanced experience and fully leveraging the wisdom of the masses. During the campaign, various tricks and rationalization proposals constantly emerged. Employees of the open-pit mine of the Fushun Mining Bureau put forward 3,127 rationalization proposals in one and a half months, greatly improving production management. Many bureaus and mines are vigorously promoting the rapid tunneling experience of Ma Liu Hai and Cui Guoshan, the safe production experience of Shi Yuhai, and the mechanized production experience of Lv Wenping, etc. The Yumen Refinery vigorously promoted the experience of the Wang Kuan class in ensuring safe and continuous inspection of production, as well as the Sang Wanxiang class in washing wax and cleaning wells. After the advanced experience of Sang Wanxiang was promoted, the time for cleaning wells was generally shortened by five and a half minutes per well per day, thus enabling the entire mine to produce 91.5 tons more crude oil per day.
    (4) All systems have strengthened the role of functional institutions. Various bureaus and mines in the coal mining system first strengthened the leadership of the work of the departments, mobilized technical and management personnel to participate in competitions, and many units' technical personnel formulated specific action plans for individuals. For example, the office personnel of several bureaus and mines in the North China region launched a four-comparison campaign (compare going deep into the workshop, compare timely problem-solving, compare the accuracy of digital plans, compare improving work methods), which greatly promoted the development of the campaign. All 26 units of the Zhaogezhuang Mine of Kailuan signed challenge and response plans and launched a red flag competition, which not only guaranteed safe production but also completed the annual production task 16 days ahead of schedule. Various bureaus and mines in the Northeast and other regions also fully leveraged the role of technical personnel. The Tangshan Power Plant organized a technical research association and established a work supervision system. The Zhangjiakou Power Bureau's engineers and technicians personally taught in the study of operating regulations, which was very effective.
    Currently, the Ministry of Fuel Industry has instructed various bureaus, mines, and factories to thoroughly implement the spirit of production increase and economy into daily work, and first ensure the completion of the tasks for the first quarter of 1954.

    燃料工业系统超额完成增产节约任务
    为国家积累资金一万多亿元
    中央人民政府燃料工业部所属各系统，超额完成了一九五三年的增产节约任务，为国家积累资金达一万零五十二亿元（不包括基本建设单位的节约数字），超过原计划百分之七十六点四。煤矿系统超过了原增产节约计划百分之二百一十九点九，电业系统超过了原计划百分之三十四点八，石油系统超过了原计划百分之五十五点六。
    燃料工业系统一九五三年增产节约运动的收获是很大的。取得上述成绩的主要原因，是由于该部及各个专业管理总局集中力量，进行了下列几项工作：
    （一）改变了领导作风。增产节约运动一开始，燃料工业系统各级领导干部即分别深入厂矿，具体帮助各厂矿，采取算大账和发动群众算细账等方法，找出企业中突出的问题与薄弱环节，并领导工人和技术人员想办法，采取各种措施，以改变落后局面。在运动初期，华北煤矿管理局五个局长就有四人在矿务局帮助工作；中南煤矿管理局副局长在萍乡矿务局帮助制订增产节约计划和措施，取得经验后，又推广到其他各矿务局。煤、电、石油各厂矿一级干部也扭转了过去开会多、不深入现场、抓不住关键的忙乱被动的工作作风。这些都有力地促进了增产节约运动的顺利开展。
      （二）抓紧了计划管理的中心环节。各级领导明确了增产节约是细致的经常工作，必须与当前中心工作密切结合，才能健康地发展。因此大部分厂矿都加强了调度工作的领导，充实了机构，配备了比较坚强的干部，并有领导地逐步贯彻了作业计划，把增产节约计划纳入了作业计划。阜新矿务局在平安一坑及海州露天运输段推行作业计划取得经验后，随即推广到全局。华北各局、矿到十一月份已有百分之六十的小组把增产节约计划纳入了作业计划。十月份，淮南矿务局全局三十七个回采工作面有十八个推行了作业计划，因而产量、效率都超额完成任务。电业技术管理方面，各局、厂普遍重视了“设备鉴定”、“设备缺陷检查”及计划检修工作，对保证安全供电起了很大的作用。玉门矿务局及石油一厂、六厂、七厂成立了全局、全厂调度网，有的单位还建立了生产作业计划执行的每日检查制，更使调度工作由被动转向主动，保证了均衡生产。
    （三）大力推广先进经验，充分发挥群众智慧。事实证明只有作好这两项工作，才能更有力地保证完成和超额完成增产节约任务。各局厂矿在开展增产节约运动的初期，先后建立了推广先进经验的专责制，充分发挥群众的智慧。在运动中，不断涌现各种窍门和合理化建议。抚顺矿务局露天矿的职工，在一个半月就提出了三千一百二十七件合理化建议，使生产管理工作大大提高。很多局、矿正大力推广马六孩、崔国山快速掘进经验、施玉海安全生产经验及吕文平机械化生产经验等。玉门炼油厂大力推广了王宽班保证安全随时检查生产以及桑万祥班洗蜡清井等经验。桑万祥先进经验推广后，一般每井每天可缩短清井时间五分半钟，因此使全矿每天可多产原油九十一点五吨。
      （四）各系统都加强了职能机构的作用。煤矿系统各局、矿首先加强了科室工作的领导，发动了技术、管理人员参加竞赛，很多单位技术人员制定了个人的具体行动计划。如华北区好几个局矿科室人员展开四比运动（比深入车间、比及时解决问题、比数字计划精确、比改进工作方法），大大推动了运动的开展。开滦赵各庄矿全矿二十六个单位都订了挑战应战计划，开展了红旗竞赛，这不仅保证了安全生产，还提前十六天完成了全年生产任务。东北及其他各区各局、矿也充分发挥了技术人员的作用。唐山发电厂组织了技术研究会，建立了工作监护制度，张家口电业局在学习运行规程中由工程师、技术员亲自上课，收效很大。
    目前，燃料工业部已指示各局、矿厂，将增产节约的精神彻贯到日常工作中去，首先保证完成一九五四年第一季度的任务。
