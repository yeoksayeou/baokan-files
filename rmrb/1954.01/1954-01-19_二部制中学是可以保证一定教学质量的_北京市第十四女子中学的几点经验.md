Two-Session Middle Schools Can Guarantee a Certain Level of Teaching Quality
—Some Experiences from Beijing No. 14 Girls' Middle School
　　Cai Wenhuan, Liu Linbei, Meng Xingwen

Beijing No. 14 Girls' Middle School currently has twelve classes and more than 670 students, an increase of three classes and more than 230 students compared to the previous semester. The school's facilities are very poor, with only two classrooms that can accommodate 70 people, five that can barely accommodate 50 people, a small playground, no library or auditorium, a small dining hall, and very narrow office space for faculty and staff. Given the school's inability to accommodate the enrollment task, the school leaders proactively proposed running a two-session system at the beginning of the semester. The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau agreed to this proposal and provided the school with much assistance. Thus, the two-session system at No. 14 Girls' Middle School was established. They adopted a "half-day" system, with each class having five lessons per day. Six classes are held in the morning and six in the afternoon, with two classes sharing a classroom, so twelve classes use six classrooms, with the remaining one used as needed. Over the past six months, they have gained some initial experience, which proves that two-session middle schools can guarantee a certain level of teaching quality, provided that teachers can prepare their lessons before class and students' learning is disciplined and organized. For example, the second class of the third grade used to have relatively poor academic performance, with a total average score of 76 in the previous semester, but this has increased to 82 in the first phase examination of this semester. To further understand the quality of two-session teaching, No. 14 Girls' Middle School used arithmetic and other subject test questions from the first phase examination of a nearby full-day school's first grade to test their own first-grade students, and the results were not low. For example, in arithmetic for the first class of the first grade, the school's original test score had an average of 67 points; the result of testing with the outside school's test questions was an average score of 71 for the whole class, which was 4 points higher than the school's original average score; and for example, in the history test for the fifth class of the first grade, using the outside school's test questions, every student passed, with an average score of 83, while in the school's original history test, four students failed. Of course, after students have reviewed and taken a phase exam, their scores are more likely to improve when tested with test questions from another school's phase exam. However, these results can still illustrate that the two-session system can guarantee a considerable level of teaching quality.

How does No. 14 Girls' Middle School guarantee a certain level of teaching quality with the two-session system? There is a lot of specific work to be done.

After the start of the school year, the first task was class assignment. The assignment of new students is based on past experience and the characteristics of the two-session system. According to past experience, there should be a certain proportion of older and younger students, Youth League members and Young Pioneers, and non-Youth League members and non-Young Pioneers in each class; students with certain work abilities should be appropriately assigned to each class so that each class has core members. However, this alone is not enough. After the school changed to a two-session system, the time for morning classes was advanced, starting at 7:00 AM. And first-grade students are relatively young, so they cannot get up too early and do not walk fast. Based on this situation, the first-grade students are assigned to classes according to the principle of being close to their home address and having the same route home. The two classes with homes closest to the school, along with the four classes of the second and third grades, are fixed to attend classes in the morning, and the remaining six first-grade classes are fixed to attend classes in the afternoon. This class assignment ensures that students will not be late for the first class in the morning, it is easier for each class to carry out class activities, it facilitates students' organization of family study groups, and it facilitates the class teacher's home visits and tutoring.

The two-session schedule needs to consider the work, study, and rest of teachers, students, and administrative leaders in many ways, so scheduling is much more difficult than for a full-day system. No. 14 Girls' Middle School schedules according to the following principles: Regarding students, the schedule ensures that the daily workload of each class is not disproportionately heavy or light; each class has a certain amount of club activities and extracurricular activities time each week; school-wide activities are divided into two parts, with each session having a joint activity time of one lesson per week. The purpose of the schedule is to balance the daily workload of students so that learning can proceed smoothly, and to ensure that the class teacher, Youth League, and Young Pioneers have time to regularly conduct collectivist education for students. Regarding teachers, the schedule ensures that teachers have time to hold business discussions each week, and teachers of the same subject have time to observe each other's teaching; teachers whose homes are far from the school and female teachers with children are not scheduled for the first lesson in the morning; most teachers' classes are concentrated in half a day, and teachers who have classes both in the morning and afternoon are guaranteed rest time at noon; teachers who have classes in the fifth lesson in the afternoon are not scheduled for the first lesson the next morning to give them more rest; to allow teachers to have sufficient time to prepare lessons, each teacher does not teach more than two new subjects per day. In this way, teachers have three to four hours each day to prepare lessons, grade homework, or exchange ideas. The advantage of this scheduling method is that teachers' spare time can be used in a concentrated manner, so work efficiency is greatly improved. For example, history teacher Liu Bingrui teaches twenty-four lessons per week and is also a class teacher, which is not a small amount of work, but he says: "The work is not busy, it is more relaxed than last semester." In the past, when there were classes all day, time was often wasted casually. For example, if there were classes in the second and fourth lessons, the third lesson was often wasted on idle chatter. Now that spare time is concentrated, everyone can use it to do work, and the above situation no longer exists. The teaching affairs office takes advantage of these favorable conditions to actively promote teacher lesson preparation and to check the teaching progress of each subject. Now, teachers of language and arithmetic subjects spend an average of five hours per week preparing each subject, and six to eight hours per week grading homework for one class; history and botany teachers spend more time preparing lessons, spending twelve hours per week collecting specimens and making charts, in addition to grading homework. The level of classroom teaching has improved compared to last semester.

No. 14 Girls' Middle School foresaw that in order to ensure a certain level of teaching effectiveness after implementing the two-session system, it was necessary to do a good job of stabilizing student morale and student learning discipline. Therefore, after the start of the school year, they introduced the school environment to the students, so that new students could quickly become familiar with and accustomed to the new learning environment. And they proactively explained the rationale for implementing the two-session system to all students. The second and third-grade students initially thought that they could not learn much by attending half-day classes, and their thoughts were somewhat volatile, but after publicity, their morale stabilized. Half-day students only attend classes for half a day, and it is easy to waste time at home for the rest of the day. No. 14 Girls' Middle School pays close attention to organizing students' family review work. They organized family study groups in students' homes with suitable conditions, according to the principles of similar areas and student voluntariness. Facts have proved that doing a good job of publicity and explanation work through students or directly to students' parents, and organizing family study groups will receive the support of many students' parents. The organized students are able to collectively review their lessons, do their homework, and engage in some short-term cultural and recreational activities for three to four hours each day. Students do not need to spend a lot of time reviewing the day's lessons in the evening, and can go to bed before 9:00 PM, getting nine hours of sleep each day, so they are full of energy when they go to class the next day. Therefore, the learning effect is greatly improved. In the past, students always felt that there was too much homework in Russian, geometry, and other courses, but now students say to the teachers: There is too little homework, please give us more!

After implementing the two-session system, school leaders paid special attention to the health of teachers and students. Students attend five consecutive lessons for half a day, and teachers also teach three to four lessons, so both teachers and students feel physically tired. Therefore, the leaders decided to fully and universally carry out cultural and recreational activities such as badminton, jump rope, and singing during the remaining break times, in addition to the morning and afternoon exercises after the third lesson, calling on teachers to participate as well, and to make these activities regular. The school's sports field is small and the sports equipment is insufficient, so the teaching affairs office mobilized music, art, and physical education teachers and the student union to organize singing teams, dance teams, harmonica teams, and art teams to carry out activities. Many students participated, with nearly 300 people in the singing and dance teams alone. In terms of sports activities, in addition to physical education classes, there is also one hour of physical exercise after the class meeting each week, and various ball games are also carried out during spare time. To ensure the health of teachers and students, they also tried to improve the meals. The work in terms of health and hygiene has also been further improved. According to the statistics of the number of visits to the school health room: In September, the number of initial visits was 150, and the number of follow-up visits was 58; in October, the number of initial visits was 129, and the number of follow-up visits was 47. It can be seen that the number of patients has not increased, but has decreased. Before the summer vacation, many students suffered from headaches, but after several statistics were taken this semester, very few students in the school suffered from headaches. The number of sick leave requests from students in each class has also generally decreased. For example, among the 54 students in the second class of the third grade, 18 people requested sick leave in May of the previous semester, while only 4 people requested sick leave in November of this semester. Not only has the students' illness decreased, but most people's weight has also increased. Because the health of teachers and students is basically guaranteed, teachers have sufficient energy to prepare lessons and teach; students also have good spirits to study. This provides important conditions for guaranteeing teaching quality.

After implementing the two-session system, the organizational structure must also be adjusted appropriately. Because students attend classes in two batches, the office hours of school leaders and all staff must be extended from 7:00 AM to 5:45 PM, with only 50 minutes of rest at noon (including meals), and they all feel overwhelmed and unable to attend to everything. The leaders of No. 14 Girls' Middle School felt that the original full-day system could not fully meet the requirements of the two-session system. To solve the problem of being overwhelmed, the school's administrative staff must properly divide their work and adjust their office hours. Therefore, it was decided that the principal should focus on leading the work of the afternoon session, while taking care of the overall work, and the vice-principal (concurrently the director of teaching affairs) should focus on leading the work of the morning session. The working hours of the deputy director of teaching affairs and the director of general affairs do not distinguish between morning and afternoon, but start from 8:00 AM to 5:45 PM, with a two-hour break at noon. The staff adopts a "continuous work system," with the teaching affairs office and the general affairs office each assigning a fixed clerk to start work at 7:00 AM and end at 4:00 PM, with a one-hour break at noon. Other staff work from 8:00 AM to 5:45 PM, with a two-hour break at noon. Workers are assigned according to the nature of their work, as far as possible in groups of two, reasonably sharing the work, and taking turns resting on Sundays. After this adjustment, there are cadres in the office during the entire class time, who can handle affairs at any time. The staff no longer feel overwhelmed or backlogged with work. It can be seen that the role of proper division of labor and adjustment of time is great. It overcomes the chaotic phenomenon of school work and promotes the school's teaching work; the original concerns of the staff that they would not be able to physically support themselves after implementing the two-session system have also been eliminated.

Since No. 14 Girls' Middle School has implemented the two-session system, there have been many problems encountered, and because some solutions have been thought of, many problems have been solved. The problems that still exist are: First, after implementing the two-session system, it is difficult to carry out school-wide collective activities. Therefore, it is not easy to cultivate a comprehensive and collective concept among teachers and students, resulting in a lack of unity, and even the phenomenon of teachers forming small cliques and rarely interacting with each other; the tendency to neglect politics has also developed. Many teachers only stick to the textbooks or chat about family琐事, and rarely read newspapers and magazines. This problem has attracted the attention of the leadership. Second, it is not possible to participate in many city-wide activities. For example, teachers' professional learning organized by the Municipal Education Bureau cannot be attended by teachers who have classes on Saturday afternoons. Activities at the Children's Palace, youth lectures, etc., are generally held on Saturday afternoons, so students in the afternoon session cannot participate. This makes it impossible for teachers and students to have more contact with society and increase their social knowledge. Third, the work of leading cadres is still relatively heavy. For example, some meetings must be held twice, in the morning and afternoon, and the deployment and leadership of learning must also be done in two shifts. In this way, the leadership work will inevitably be increased. Fourth, although cultural, recreational, and sports activities have been carried out as much as possible, students and teachers still feel that they do not have enough energy during the fifth lesson in the afternoon; these problems need to be solved one by one.

    二部制中学是可以保证一定教学质量的
    ——北京市第十四女子中学的几点经验
    蔡文焕　刘琳琲　蒙杏文
    北京市第十四女子中学现有十二个班，学生六百七十多人，较上学期增加了三个班，学生增加了二百三十多人。这个学校的校舍设备是很差的，全校只有两个可容七十人、五个勉强可容五十人的教室，一个小操场，没有图书阅览室和礼堂，膳厅很小，教职员办公的地方也很窄。根据校舍不能适应招生任务的情况，学校负责人在学期开始的时候主动提出了举办二部制的建议。北京市人民政府教育局同意了这个建议，并且给了学校许多帮助。第十四女中的二部制就这样办起来了。他们采用了“半日制”的方式，每班每日上五节课。上午六个班，下午也六个班，每两班固定用一个教室，十二个班用六个教室，余下的一个机动使用。半年以来，他们已经取得了若干初步经验，这些经验证明：在保证教师上课前都能备好课，学生的学习能有纪律有组织地进行的条件下，二部制中学是可以保证一定的教学质量的。例如，初三第二班过去学习成绩是比较差的，上学期全班总平均分数是七十六分，本学期第一次阶段考试已提高到八十二分。为了进一步了解二部制教学的质量，十四女中曾以附近某全日制学校一年级第一次阶段考试的算术等科试题，来测验本校初一学生，结果成绩并不低。如初一第一班的算术，本校原来的考试成绩，平均分数是六十七分；用外校试题测验的结果，全班平均分数是七十一分，比本校原来的平均分数还高四分；又如初一第五班用外校的历史试题测验的结果，每个学生都及格，平均分数是八十三分，而本校原来的历史考试有四人不及格。当然，学生经过复习和阶段考试，再用别校阶段考试的试题来测验，学生的成绩是比较容易提高的。但是，这些成绩仍可以说明二部制是可以保证相当的教学质量的。
    第十四女中的二部制是怎样保证一定教学质量的呢？这有许多具体工作要做。
    开学以后，首先遇到的是编班工作。新生编班是根据历年的经验和二部制的特点来作的。按照历年的经验，每班中年龄大的学生和年龄小的学生，团员、队员和非团员、非队员应有一定比例；把具有一定工作能力的学生适当地分配到各班，使各班都有骨干分子。但是，仅仅这样还不行，学校改成二部制以后，上午班上课的时间较过去提早了，在早上七时就开始上课。而初一学生年纪都比较小，起床不可能太早，走路也不快。根据这样的情况，初中一年级的学生，就按家庭住址相近和回家时路线相同的原则来编班。其中家庭离学校最近的编成两个班，和二、三年级的四个班，固定在上午上课，其余的六个初一班，都固定在下午上课。这样编班，可以保证上午第一节课学生不会迟到，各班也容易开展班的活动，而且便于学生组织家庭学习小组，也便于班主任进行家庭访问和辅导工作。
    二部制的课程表，须要在时间上多方面照顾教师、学生和行政领导人员的工作、学习和休息，所以，课程表的编排比全日制要困难得多。十四女中是根据下述原则来排课程表的：关于学生方面，照顾到每班每天的课程不要畸重畸轻；各班每周都有一定的社团活动和课外活动时间；全校性的活动分作两部分进行，一部和二部每周各有一节共同的活动时间。课程表照顾这些方面，目的是使学生每日负担的功课均衡，学习能够顺利进行，并保证班主任、青年团和少年先锋队有时间经常对学生进行集体主义教育。关于教师方面，课程表照顾到教师每周有开业务讨论会的时间，同科的教师每周有互相观摩教学的时间；住宿地方离学校远的教师和有小孩的女教师，上午第一节不给排课；大多数教师的课都集中在半天内，少数上下午都有课的教师则保证他们中午有休息时间；下午第五节有课的教师，次日上午第一节不排课，让他们多休息；为了使教师有比较充足的时间备课，每个教师每天不超过两个新课目。这样，使教师们每天都有三、四小时来备课、批改作业或交流经验。这种排课方法的优点是：教师的课余时间能够集中使用，因此工作效率提高很多。例如历史教师刘秉瑞每周担任二十四节课，还兼班主任，工作不算少，可是他说：“工作不忙，比上学期还从容些。”过去全日有课的时候，时间常常随随便便地浪费掉了。譬如第二、四节有课，第三节就往往扯谈浪费了，现在空堂时间集中，大家都可利用来做工作了，便不再有上述这种情况。教导处利用这些有利条件，积极推动教师备课，并且检查各科教学进度。现在语文、算术科教师，平均每门每周的备课时间都有五小时，改一个班的作业每周都用六至八小时；历史、植物科教师备课时间要更多些，除改作业外，每周还用十二小时来采集标本和制作图表等。课堂教学的水平比上学期提高了。
    第十四女子中学预见到，实行二部制以后，要保证一定的教学效果，必须做好安定学生情绪和学生学习纪律的工作。因此，开学以后，他们向学生介绍了学校环境，使新生迅速熟悉和习惯于新的学习环境。并且主动向全体学生解释了实行二部制的道理。初中二、三年级的学生，起先认为上半日课不可能学到很多东西，思想有些波动，经过宣传，情绪安定下来。半日制学生只上半天课，其余半天在家，很容易把时间荒废，第十四女中很注意做好学生家庭复习的组织工作，他们按照地区相近、学生自愿的原则，在有条件的学生家庭中组织了家庭学习小组。事实证明，通过学生或直接向学生家长做好宣传解释工作，组织家庭学习小组是会得到很多学生家长支持的。组织起来的学生每天能够有三、四小时的时间集体温习功课、做作业，和进行一些短时间的文化娱乐活动。学生晚上不用很多时间就能复习完当天的功课，晚上九时以前就可以睡觉，每天有九小时睡眠，次日上课时精神饱满。因此，学习效果大大提高。过去，俄文、几何等课程，学生总觉得作业留得多了，现在学生向教师说：作业少了，多留几个吧！
    实行二部制以后，学校负责人对于教师和学生的健康特别注意。学生半天连续上五节课，教师也上三、四节课，师生都感到身体疲倦。于是，领导方面决定除了上午及下午第三节以后的课间操外，利用其他课余的休息时间，充分地、普遍地开展板羽球、跳绳、歌咏等文化娱乐活动，号召教师也参加，并且使这些活动经常化。学校的运动场小，体育设备不够，教导处便发动音乐、美术、体育各科教师及学生会组织歌咏队、舞蹈队、口琴队和美工队展开活动，学生参加的很多，只歌咏队和舞蹈队将近三百人。体育活动方面，除各班体育课外，每周班会后还有一小时的体育锻炼，在课余时间还开展了各种球类比赛。为了保证师生的健康，又设法改善了伙食。卫生、保健方面的工作也有进一步的改善。根据学校卫生室的诊病次数的统计：九月份初诊人数是一百五十人，复诊人数是五十八人；十月份初诊人数是一百二十九人，复诊人数是四十七人。可见患病人数并没有增加，而是减少了。在暑假前，学生患头痛的很多，本学期作了几次统计，全校学生很少患头痛的了。各班学生请病假的人次也普遍减少。例如初三第二班五十四个学生中，上学期五月份请病假的有十八人次，而本学期十一月份只有四人次。学生的疾病不但减少了，而且大多数人的体重都增加了。由于基本上保证了师生的身体健康，教师有充沛的精力备课和上课；学生也有良好的精神来学习。这给保证教学质量提供了重要的条件。
    实行二部制以后，组织机构也要作适当的调整。由于学生分两批上课，学校领导人和全体职工的办公时间要从上午七时一直延长到下午五时四十五分，中午只休息五十分钟（包括吃饭），他们都感到工作忙乱不堪，顾此失彼。第十四女中的领导人员觉得，原来全日制的一套制度已经不能完全符合二部制的要求，要解决工作忙乱的问题，学校行政工作人员必须适当分工，并调整办公时间。于是决定校长在照顾全面工作的基础上，把重点放在领导下午班的工作，副校长（兼教导主任）的工作重点放在领导上午班的工作。副教导主任及总务主任的工作时间不分上下午，但从上午八时开始，到下午五时四十五分止，中午休息两小时。职工采用“连带上班制”，教导处和总务处各固定派一个干事在上午七时开始办公，至下午四时止，中午休息一小时。其他职员则都在上午八时至下午五时四十五分办公，中午休息两小时。工友按工作性质来分工，尽可能两个人一组，合理分担工作，星期天轮流休息。经过这样调整，整个上课时间内都有干部在办公，能够随时处理事务，职工们再也不觉得工作繁重，或积压工作了。可见适当分工和调整时间的作用很大，它克服了学校工作的忙乱现象，推动了全校的教学工作；原来职工们怕实行二部制后身体支持不住的顾虑也消除了。
    第十四女中举办二部制以来，遇到的问题是很多的，因为想了一些办法，很多问题都解决了。现在还存在着的问题是：第一，实行二部制以后，全校性的集体活动很困难进行，因此。不容易很好地培养师生员工的全面的、集体的观念，以致发生了不够团结，甚至教师之间也有闹小圈子，很少往来的现象；忽视政治的倾向也有了发展，很多教师只是死扣教本，或者聊些家庭琐事，很少看报纸杂志。这个问题已引起领导方面的注意。第二，很多全市性的活动也不可能参加。例如，市教育局组织的教师业务学习，星期六下午有课的教师就参加不了。少年宫的活动、青年讲座报告等，时间一般都在星期六下午，下午班的学生就没法参加。这使师生不可能更多地和社会联系和增进社会知识。第三，领导干部的工作，还是比较繁重。例如，有些会必须分上下午两次召开，布置和领导学习，也分两摊。这样，领导工作就必然要加重些。第四，虽然尽量地开展了文化娱乐和体育活动，但是下午第五节课时，学生和教师仍然感到精神不够；这些问题是需要一一解决的。
