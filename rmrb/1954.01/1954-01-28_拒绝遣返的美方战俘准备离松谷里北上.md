Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 27th. Personnel from the Korean Red Cross and the Chinese Red Cross here say that 347 American, British, and South Korean prisoners of war who refused repatriation are busy today preparing to leave the Songgok-ri POW camp for the North.

A day earlier, these prisoners of war requested the Korean-Chinese side to grant them the right to reside as free men. General Li Sang-jo wrote to General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, yesterday, suggesting that the Indian custodial forces hand over these prisoners of war to the Korean Red Cross and the Chinese Red Cross tomorrow.

Seven Korean barbers were busy all day in small barber shops covered with wooden boards, giving haircuts to their fellow prisoners of war. American prisoner of war Richard Corton said, "We want to look neat when we return to Kaesong."

Another American prisoner of war, William Corwart, said to a staff member of the Chinese Red Cross, "All we have to do now is pack up and leave." Four Korean female prisoners of war had already packed their belongings early this morning and were waiting for the Red Cross trucks to transport them.

American prisoners of war were busy this afternoon packing their books and sports equipment into boxes. They said they would carry their musical instruments and records in their hands. American black prisoner of war Clarence Adams spent two hours this afternoon asking his Korean friends to write inscriptions in his commemorative album.

　　拒绝遣返的美方战俘准备离松谷里北上
    【新华社开城二十七日电】　此间朝鲜红十字会和中国红十字会人员说，三百四十七名拒绝遣返的美国、英国和南朝鲜战俘今天忙着准备离开松谷里的看管营到北方去。
    一天以前，这些战俘要求朝中方面给他们以作为自由人的居留的权利。李相朝将军昨天写信给中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军，建议印度看管部队明天把这些战俘交给朝鲜红十字会和中国红十字会。
    七名朝鲜籍理发师整天忙着在用木板盖的小理发室里给他们的战俘同伴理发。美国战俘理查德·柯敦说：“我们想在回到开城的时候搞得整洁一些。”
    另一名美国战俘威廉·科华特对一位中国红十字会人员说：“我们现在要做的就是卷铺盖走路了。”四名朝鲜籍女战俘今天一早已整理好她们的什物，等红十字会的卡车来把这些什物运走。
    美国战俘今天下午忙着把他们的书籍和体育用品装进箱子。他们说，他们将把乐器和唱片拿在手里带走。美国黑人战俘克拉伦斯·亚当斯今天下午花了两小时的时间请他的朝鲜朋友在纪念册上题字。
