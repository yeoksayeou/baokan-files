    With the Development of National Economic Construction, Basic Construction Teams are Rapidly Growing
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] With the development of national economic construction, the national basic construction teams are growing rapidly. At the end of 1951, there were only about 600,000 construction workers in the country. By the end of 1952, this number had increased to one million, and by the end of 1953, it had grown to 1.68 million. After the establishment of the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government in July 1952, the policy of unified state management of the construction industry was initially realized. Leadership organizations above the provincial and municipal levels were gradually established, and construction and installation engineering companies of various types of work were organized. At present, the Ministry of Construction Engineering system has a total of more than 695,000 employees, including more than 555,000 workers. The Ministry of Heavy Industry has established 32 construction and installation engineering companies, including more than 109,000 employees. The Ministry of Fuel Industry has established 52 engineering companies and 22 engineering teams, with a total of more than 116,000 employees. The Ministry of Railways has established ten engineering bureaus and specialized companies for tunnels, plant construction, communications, and mechanical road construction, with a total of more than 100,000 employees. The First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, and other systems have also organized a number of construction forces.
    In the process of cultivating basic construction technical forces, in order to meet the needs of national construction, various departments have adopted methods such as winter training and running technical schools, short-term training classes, spare-time technical schools, spare-time technical lectures, as well as signing apprenticeship contracts and mutual assistance contracts between workers and technicians, effectively improving the technical level of the majority of workers and management personnel. Many cadres who originally knew nothing about management and workers who did not understand technology, after a period of training and practice, some have become construction site directors, and some have become excellent construction workers and material managers. Many apprentices have become technicians, many technicians have been upgraded, and many outstanding veteran technicians have been promoted to management cadres. In the basic construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company alone, more than 8,000 new workers were trained in the past year, more than 690 worker technicians were trained, and more than 450 professional cadres were trained.
    In the basic construction project, the vast number of employees have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity. Wang Gui'an, engineer of the Vehicle Factory construction site of the 7th Engineering Team of the 1st Construction Engineering Company of Harbin, Wang Jink, head of the Planning Section, Sun Yuxi, director of technology, Bai Xirong, technician, and workers Geng Shanfa and Bi Changlin cooperated to learn the advanced experience of Wang Sunchi's segmented assembly line operation and inclined support formwork, and created a three-dimensional parallel rapid construction method. Using this method, sixteen bricklayers spent eight and a half days to complete a three-story building that required 320,000 bricks, exceeding the record created by Wang Sunchi's segmented assembly line operation by one and a half times. This creation played a huge role in striving to complete the outdoor project of the vehicle factory ahead of schedule before freezing last year. Han Qingchen, leader of the bricklaying team of the Anshan Iron and Steel Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company, created an advanced experience in building refractory bricks—a two-handed slurry flowing bricklaying method, which greatly shortened the construction time of the 15th and 16th coking furnaces and strengthened the life of the furnace body.
    With the improvement of technical level, basic construction workers can not only build tall buildings, but also can build completely modern and structurally complex factories. For example, the metal structure of the factory building of my country's first large-scale motor factory is composed of more than 3,000 tons of steel of different specifications and more than 150 tons of rivets. In the past, it would take three years to complete, but the workers of the riveting and welding factory of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau only used 113 days to complete it, and the project quality exceeded the national standards.
    In order to welcome the basic construction tasks in 1954, the relevant departments are actively expanding and consolidating the organization. The Central Construction Engineering Department decided to organize sixteen state-owned engineering companies and strive to train eight construction engineering teams into highly skilled "field armies" to meet the major tasks in basic construction projects.

    随着国家经济建设的开展
    基本建设队伍迅速壮大
    【本报讯】随着国家经济建设的开展，全国基本建设队伍正在迅速成长壮大。一九五一年年底，全国建筑工人只有六十万左右，到一九五二年年底增加为一百万人，到一九五三年年底发展到一百六十八万人。中央人民政府建筑工程部在一九五二年七月成立后，初步实现了国家统一经营建筑业的方针，逐步建立了省、市以上的领导机构，组织了各种工种的建筑安装工程公司。现在，建筑工程部系统共有职工六十九万五千多人，其中工人五十五万五千多人。重工业部系统已建立了三十二个建筑安装工程公司，包括职工十万九千多人。燃料工业部建立了五十二个工程公司和二十二个工程队，共有职工十一万六千多人。铁道部建立了十个工程局和隧道、建厂、通信口号、机械筑路等专业公司，共有职工十万多人。第一机械工业部、交通部、水利部、纺织工业部、轻工业部等系统，也分别组织了一批建筑力量。
    在培养基本建设技术力量过程中，为了适应国家建设的需要，各部门采取了冬季训练和开办技工学校、短期训练班、业余技术学校、业余技术讲座，以及签订师徒合同、工人和技术人员的互助合同等办法，有效地提高了广大工人和管理人员的技术水平。许多原来完全不会管理的干部和不懂技术的工人，经过一定时期的培养和锻炼，有的已经成为工地主任，有的已经成为优秀的施工员和材料管理员。许多徒工变成了技工，许多技工升了级，许多优秀的老技术工人被提拔为管理干部。仅鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门，在去年一年当中就培养出八千多新工人，培养了工人技术员六百九十多人，培养了专业干部四百五十多人。
    在基本建设工程中，广大职工发挥了高度的劳动热情和创造精神。哈尔滨市第一建筑工程公司第七工程队车辆厂工地的工程师王贵安、计划科长王金棵、技术主任孙玉玺、技术员白锡荣和工人耿善发、毕长林等合作，学习了王孙慈分段流水作业及斜撑模板等先进经验，创造了立体平行快速施工法。采用这个方法，十六个砌砖工人用八天半的时间，砌完了一栋需砌砖三十二万块的三层楼房，超过了王孙慈分段流水作业法所创纪录的一倍半。这个创造，对争取在去年结冰前提前完成车辆厂室外工程起了巨大作用。鞍钢工业筑炉工程公司瓦工组组长韩庆臣，创造了砌筑耐火砖的先进经验——双手蘸浆流水砌砖法，大大缩短了第十五、十六号炼焦炉的施工时间，加固了炉体的寿命。
    随着技术水平的提高，基本建设工人不仅能建筑高大的楼房，而且已经能够建设完全近代化的结构复杂的工厂。如我国第一个大型电机厂厂房金属结构，是由三千多吨规格不同的钢材和一百五十多吨铆钉组合成的，在过去需要三年才能完成，但是有色金属工业局铆焊厂的工人，只用一百一十三天就完成了，而且工程质量超过了国家规定标准。
    为了迎接一九五四年的基本建设任务，各有关部门正在积极扩大和整顿组织机构。中央建筑工程部决定组织十六个国营工程公司，并争取把八个建筑工程队训练成为技术高超的“野战军”，以迎接基本建设工程中的重大任务。
