　　Strengthening the General Line Propaganda Work of Cultural Centers and Stations

Cultural centers and stations have extensive connections with the broad masses of the people and are powerful assistants to the Party and the People's Government in mass cultural education work. Recently, under the unified leadership and assistance of the Party committees, cultural centers and stations in various regions have been using various methods to publicize the general line of the state's transition period to the urban and rural people. Some cultural centers and stations, combined with production and connected with life, have enlightened the socialist consciousness of the peasant masses in a popular and vivid way using specific examples familiar to the local people. Some use slides, radios, books, blackboards and other forms welcomed by the masses to carry out propaganda to the peasants. Some cultural centers and stations also organized mobile propaganda teams to carry out propaganda to the masses in places such as temple fairs, market towns, grain depots, and truck stops, which achieved good results and gained a lot of experience.

However, some cultural centers and stations still have some problems in the general line propaganda. The first is that the content of the propaganda is not rich enough and the quality is not high enough. In some places, the leadership does not pay enough attention to the work of cultural centers and stations, and has not carried out necessary political and ideological education for the staff of cultural centers and stations, has not organized them to study politics and policies, and has not provided specific guidance and assistance in their work (such as providing them with propaganda materials and singing materials). At the same time, some cultural centers and stations themselves have not regularly submitted their work plans and reported the situation to the local Party committees and cultural authorities, and have not actively sought help from the leading organs. This is the main reason why some cultural centers and stations cannot play their due role.

The Spring Festival is approaching, and cultural centers and stations must seize this opportunity to organize forces from all aspects, and through various cultural and artistic activities, publicize the general line to the masses, and carry out education on the worker-peasant alliance to the peasant masses and workers. Party committees and government cultural departments at all levels should earnestly lead and assist local cultural centers and stations, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Culture on carrying out rural cultural and artistic activities during the Spring Festival to publicize the general line to the peasants, do a good job in the Spring Festival propaganda work, and sum up experience in a timely manner, in order to further carry out the propaganda and education work of cultural centers and stations.

### 加强文化馆、站的总路线宣传工作

　　加强文化馆、站的总路线宣传工作
    文化馆、文化站和广大人民群众有着广泛的联系，是党和人民政府在群众文化教育工作方面的有力助手。最近期间，各地文化馆、站在党委的统一领导和帮助下，运用各种方式，向城乡人民宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线。有的文化馆、站，结合生产、联系生活，用当地群众所熟悉的具体事例，通俗地、生动地启发农民群众的社会主义觉悟。有的运用幻灯、收音机、图书、黑板报以及其他各种为群众所喜闻乐见的形式，向农民进行宣传。某些文化馆、站并组织流动宣传队，利用庙会、集镇、粮栈、大车店等场所向群众进行宣传，收到了良好效果，取得了不少经验。
    但是，目前有些文化馆、站，在总路线宣传中还存在着一些问题。首先是宣传内容不充实，质量不够高。有些地方的领导方面对文化馆、站工作也不够重视，没有对文化馆、站工作人员进行必要的政治思想教育，没有组织他们进行政治和政策学习，也没有在工作方面给以具体的指导和帮助（如供给他们宣传资料和演唱材料等）。同时，有的文化馆、站本身也没有经常向当地党委和文化主管部门，提出自己的工作计划，汇报情况，主动地争取领导机关的帮助。这就是某些文化馆、站不能发挥应有作用的主要原因。
    春节快到来了，文化馆、站必须抓紧这一时机，组织各方面的力量，通过各种文艺活动，向群众宣传总路线，向农民群众和工人进行工农联盟的教育。各地党委和政府文化主管部门应切实领导和帮助当地文化馆、站，根据中央文化部关于开展春节农村文艺活动向农民宣传总路线的指示，做好春节的宣传工作，并及时总结经验，以便进一步开展文化馆、站的宣传教育工作。
