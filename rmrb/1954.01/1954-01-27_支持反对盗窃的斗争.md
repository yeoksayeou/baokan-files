　　Supporting the Struggle Against Theft

　　Resolutely fighting against acts of stealing state wealth and against bureaucratic styles of work in state organs and enterprises is a regular duty of the leading class of the state—the working class. Newspapers must be good at educating the broad masses of workers to recognize and undertake this responsibility through typical and vivid examples.

　　The "Thieves and Bureaucrats," published by Shanghai Jiefang Daily on January 13, is a report with educational significance. Based on the visit of worker Qian Junsheng, and after an investigation by the newspaper's reader reception office, this report details the process of Qian Junsheng, a worker at the Cao Hongyu Oil Boiling Workshop in Shanghai, fighting against奸商 (unscrupulous merchants) who were stealing state property. It also forcefully exposes the serious bureaucratic style of work of Liu Debin, the head of the financial section of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's Dairy and Meat Management Office, and others. Shao Minqiang, the boss of the Cao Hongyu Oil Boiling Workshop, was exposed as having all five poisons during the "Five-Anti" campaign. After the "Five-Anti" campaign, his nature did not change. While processing oil for the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's Dairy and Meat Management Office, he still tried every means to falsely report the amount of oil processed and steal a large amount of lard. In order to seek illegal profits, he even sold diseased pork used for boiling oil as good meat, endangering people's health. Qian Junsheng, a worker in the factory who had received a profound class education in the "Five-Anti" struggle, understood that he had the responsibility to supervise the capitalists and waged an irreconcilable struggle against the illegal activities of the 奸商 Shao Minqiang. He not only overcame various difficulties and conducted an in-depth investigation into Shao Minqiang's theft activities from various aspects; but also, regardless of the boss's threats of "no wages, no food," repeatedly reported to the Dairy and Meat Management Office. However, Liu Debin, the head of the financial section of the Dairy and Meat Management Office, and others, due to their serious bureaucratic style of work, blindly trusted the 奸商 Shao Minqiang. They were indifferent to Qian Junsheng, a worker who ran to the Dairy and Meat Management Office forty-six times to report the boss's illegal activities, and even believed that Qian Junsheng's patriotic behavior was "acting impulsively." This allowed the 奸商 Shao Minqiang to steal state property wantonly without being promptly punished by law (he has now been sentenced to prison).

　　Obviously, the spirit of worker Qian Junsheng in cherishing state property is worthy of great promotion, while the bureaucratic style of work of cadres such as Liu Debin of the Dairy and Meat Management Office is intolerable. The Jiefang Daily published a short commentary on this. The commentary pointed out that in order to more effectively combat theft, in addition to promoting the spirit of cherishing state property like Qian Junsheng, it is also necessary to effectively overcome the bureaucratic style of work of some of our staff.

　　Upon seeing the criticism in the newspaper, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau immediately held a meeting of cadres above the level of section chief to study how to handle the matter. In addition to deciding to form an inspection team to conduct an in-depth inspection of the Dairy and Meat Management Office to investigate the incident, it also combined the inspection with the study of the general line to help the cadres of the Dairy and Meat Management Office establish a clear idea of relying on the working class and oppose the bureaucratic style of work in the organs. Responsible cadres of the Health Bureau also extended condolences to worker Qian Junsheng. Many workers and state employees wrote to the newspaper, saying that through this incident, they more deeply realized that "China's economic construction must rely on the working class," that "the socialist transformation of private capitalist economy is an arduous task," and that "we must be highly vigilant against the harm of bureaucracy." They also expressed that in order to protect the interests of the country from any infringement, they would learn from Comrade Qian Junsheng.

　　This report by the Jiefang Daily once again proves that opposing theft and bureaucracy is a long-term struggle. The responsibility of the newspaper lies in: constantly using typical examples to educate and encourage the masses of the people, especially the working masses, to actively participate in this struggle, so as to ensure the smooth advancement of the national construction cause.

　　支持反对盗窃的斗争
    向盗窃国家财富的行为、向国家机关和企业中的官僚主义作风进行坚决的斗争，是国家领导阶级——工人阶级的经常职责。报纸要善于通过典型的、生动的事例来教育广大工人群众认识并担负起这一职责。
    上海解放日报一月十三日发表的“盗贼和官僚主义者”，是一篇富有教育意义的报道。这篇报道根据工人钱俊生的来访，经过该报读者接待室的调查，详细地介绍了上海市曹宏裕熬油作坊工人钱俊生与盗窃国家财产的奸商作斗争的经过，并有力地揭露了上海市卫生局乳肉管理所财务股股长刘德邠等的严重官僚主义作风。曹宏裕熬油作坊老板邵民强在“五反”中暴露出五毒俱全，“五反”后本性未改，在替上海市卫生局乳肉管理所加工熬油过程中，仍然千方百计地虚报加工油量，盗卖大批猪油；他为了谋取非法利润，甚至将用来熬油的病猪肉冒充好肉出卖，危害人民健康。在“五反”斗争中受过深刻阶级教育的该厂工人钱俊生，明白自己有监督资方的责任，向奸商邵民强的不法行为进行了不调和的斗争。他不仅克服了种种困难，从多方面深入地调查邵民强的盗窃勾当；而且不顾老板“不发工资、不开饭”等报复手段的威胁，向乳肉管理所一次又一次地进行检举。可是乳肉管理所的财务股股长刘德邠等由于严重的官僚主义作风，对于奸商邵民强竟盲目信任，对于为了检举老板不法行为连跑四十六次乳肉管理所的工人钱俊生却爱理不理，甚至认为钱俊生这种爱国行为是“意气用事”。这就使得奸商邵民强能够放肆地盗窃国家财产，而没有及时地受到法律的制裁（现已被判徒刑）。
    显然，工人钱俊生这种爱护国家财产的精神是值得大大发扬的，而乳肉管理所干部刘德邠等的官僚主义作风却是不可容忍的。解放日报为此发表了短评。短评指出，为了更有效地与盗窃行为作斗争，除必须发扬如同钱俊生这样的爱护国家财产的精神外，还必须切实地克服我们某些工作人员中的官僚主义作风。
    上海市卫生局看到报纸上的批评，立即举行处长以上干部会议，研究处理办法，除决定组成检查组深入乳肉管理所检查此一事件经过外，并结合检查总路线的学习情况，帮助乳肉管理所干部树立明确的依靠工人阶级的思想，反对机关工作中的官僚主义作风。并由卫生局负责干部向工人钱俊生进行了慰问。许多工人和国家工作人员写信给报社说，他们通过这一事件更深刻地认识到“我国经济建设事业必须依靠工人阶级”，“对私人资本主义经济实行社会主义改造是一件艰巨的工作”，“对官僚主义的危害性，必须提高警惕”。他们并且表示，为了维护国家的利益不受任何侵害，要向钱俊生同志学习。
    解放日报的这个报道又一次证明了，反对盗窃行为和官僚主义是长期的斗争。报纸的责任就在于：随时运用典型事例来教育和鼓励人民群众首先是工人群众积极地参加这一斗争，以保障国家建设事业的顺利推进。　（湜辛）
