Comrades!
    Thirty years have passed since the death of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the genius of the revolution, the founder of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the father of the Soviet socialist state, and the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world.
    For thirty years, the Communist Party has been leading the Soviet people forward along the correct path pointed out by Lenin. The immortal Leninist ideology illuminates the path of the Soviet working people in building a communist society. It has had a huge impact on the entire course of world history, inspiring the working people of the world to fight against capitalist oppression, to build a new and free life, and to strive for international peace and friendship.
    After Lenin's death, the Communist Party, nurtured by Lenin, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by J.V. Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, smashed all attacks by the enemies of socialism, safeguarded Leninism, and ensured the cause of building the world's first socialist society in our country. Although the reactionary forces of imperialism have tried to reverse or hinder the course of history, history still advances according to the objective laws of historical development, according to the immortal and invincible Marxist-Leninist doctrine that reflects these laws. The forces of peace, democracy, and socialism are growing stronger year by year; the greatness of Lenin's revolutionary scientific foresight and the laws of modern social development discovered by Lenin are being proved more and more clearly and convincingly.

    (I)
    Marx discovered the economic laws of the development of bourgeois society. He studied the production relations of capitalist society from its origin, development, and decline, and scientifically proved the inevitability of capitalism tending towards death and the revolutionary transition of capitalist society to socialist society.
    In the new historical era, when capitalism developed to its highest stage—the stage of imperialism, when the control of monopoly capital had been established—Lenin made a brilliant and scientific analysis of the economic and political essence of imperialism as the final stage of capitalism. Lenin discovered the law of uneven economic and political development of capitalism in the imperialist stage, and the possibility of socialism first winning victory in several countries or even in one country.
    According to Lenin's definition, the economic essence of imperialism lies in the substitution of monopoly for free competition. This monopoly is manifested in the monopolies of trusts, syndicates, and powerful banks, and in the plundering and purchasing of raw material resources. Lenin said: "The crux of the matter is economic monopoly." The pursuit of maximum monopoly profits is the characteristic of economic monopoly. These classic arguments of Lenin essentially revealed the starting point of the basic economic laws of imperialism.
    Lenin believed that the transition from democracy to political reaction is a characteristic of the political superstructure of monopoly capitalism. He pointed out that the intensified reaction at home and abroad, the intensified national oppression, the attempts of imperialism to undermine the political and national independence of other nations and countries, and the struggle of capitalist countries to redivide the world are all characteristics of capitalist monopoly.
    The greater the imperialist oppression of monopoly capital, the stronger the resistance of the working class and the oppressed people of the colonies and semi-colonies, and the stronger the resistance of the people whose national independence and state sovereignty have been undermined by imperialism. The increasing resistance of the people of all countries to imperialist policies and imperialist oppression is the fatal weakness of imperialism. The facts and developments in recent years clearly show that the pursuit of maximum profits by capitalist monopoly capital, which has caused irresolvable contradictions in the trade of the world capitalist market, and the policy of suppressing the national independence movements of other countries, which inevitably arouses the resistance of the people of all countries, are deepening the general crisis of the entire capitalist system.
    Based on a practical analysis of extensive materials, and based on a theoretical summary of the consequences brought to the people by the First World War, Lenin scientifically proved that capitalism, which had been developing upwards until the end of the nineteenth century, had become parasitic and dying capitalism in the era of imperialism, driving mankind into the abyss of bloody wars and economic disasters time and again.
    Lenin repeatedly emphasized in his writings that the bourgeois political leaders were unable to understand the most important consequences and outcome of the imperialist war. The consequences of the war opened the eyes of millions of people who had been trampled, ravaged, deceived and blinded by the bourgeoisie.
    The great October Socialist Revolution vividly confirmed Lenin's revolutionary theory. Under the wise leadership of Lenin and the Party of Lenin, the Russian proletariat, in alliance with the revolutionary peasants, and in alliance with all the previously oppressed ethnic groups, completed the greatest cause in history—first breaking through the front line of world imperialism, first establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and unfolding a new era in world history, the era of the victory of socialism.
    To overthrow the imperialist forces in Russia and to withdraw the country from the imperialist war, it required Lenin's brilliant revolutionary genius, the greatest heroism and indomitable spirit of Lenin's Party, and the great upsurge of the revolutionary forces of the broad masses of the Russian people.
    The great Party founded by Lenin swept away the Mensheviks who clamored that the Russian proletariat was a minority of the Russian people and insisted that it was "not yet mature" enough to carry out a socialist revolution. It bravely and confidently led the working class and its revolutionary ally, the laboring peasants, to overthrow the imperialist forces and guide them to the victory of the October Socialist Revolution of 1917.
    Lenin brilliantly predicted that it would ultimately be capitalism itself and the ever-increasing contradictions of imperialism that would educate and train the majority of the world's people to fight. He predicted that the majority of the world's people were being drawn into the struggle for their liberation with extraordinary speed. Lenin had no doubt that the final victory of socialism was fully and absolutely guaranteed.
    The entire course of history has confirmed, and is confirming, Lenin's scientific prediction. After the Soviet people created the necessary conditions for the rapid development of productive forces in a revolutionary way, they built a socialist society in our country under the leadership of Lenin's Party and defeated German fascism and Japanese militarism. As a result of the defeat of German fascism and Japanese militarism in the Second World War, many countries in Europe and the great People's Republic of China broke away from the imperialist system, thus forming a powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.
    After the end of the Civil War and foreign intervention, Lenin pointed out that our country had obtained the possibility of peaceful coexistence with capitalist countries for an entire period. Lenin also warned that the imperialists would not abandon their conspiracies, and therefore we must steadfastly strengthen the national defense of our socialist motherland.
    Lenin emphasized that the Soviet government had always been willing to establish normal diplomatic and trade relations with capitalist countries, including the United States.
    In 1920, a reporter from an American newspaper asked Lenin what the basis was for establishing peace with the United States. In his famous reply, Lenin said:
    "Let American capitalists not touch us. We will not touch them either. We are even willing to use gold to buy machines, tools, and everything needed for transportation and industry, not only with gold but also with raw materials." ("Lenin Collected Works," Volume 30, page 340)
    Lenin repeatedly spoke of his willingness to establish friendly relations with Britain and France. In 1922, when Lenin met with a reporter from the British "Manchester Guardian" to answer questions about the future of Soviet cooperation with Britain and France, he pointed out: "We believe that it is entirely possible to establish very friendly relations with these two countries, and this is our goal... We believe that the correctly understood interests of Britain and France will also play a role in this regard." ("Lenin Collected Works," Volume 33, page 346)
    These words of Lenin exposed the slander of the enemies in the imperialist camp, who said that the Soviet government was "unwilling" to establish normal relations with capitalist countries. Lenin attached particular importance to the trade relations between the Soviet Union and bourgeois countries, believing that this was one of the main factors promoting the long-term peaceful coexistence of the two systems. Lenin pointed out that capitalist countries would inevitably establish trade relations with the Soviet Union in the end because of economic difficulties. Lenin said: "There is a force more powerful than the wishes, will, and decisions of any hostile government and class. This is the universal economic relationship of the whole world, which forces them to embark on the road of establishing relations with us." ("Lenin Collected Works," Volume 33, page 129)
    The Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union have always followed the doctrine of our great teacher Lenin regarding the possibility of long-term peaceful coexistence between our country and capitalist countries. Lenin's doctrine on the possibility of long-term peaceful coexistence and economic cooperation between the two systems—socialism and capitalism—is the fundamental principle of the Soviet government's struggle for a stable and lasting peace and for easing international tensions. The Soviet government has made every necessary effort to achieve a peaceful settlement of all outstanding disputes.
    The Soviet government's unyielding struggle for a lasting and stable peace and for the consolidation of international security has received the support and sympathy of all progressive mankind. The powerful and organized peace movement currently unfolding in various countries is the most vivid proof of Lenin's words: "Our policy of peace is endorsed by the vast majority of people in the world." ("Lenin Collected Works," Volume 30, page 365)
    Leninism is the banner of the struggle of all progressive mankind against imperialism, for peace, for friendship among the people of all countries, and for a bright and brilliant future for the people of all countries. Relying on Leninism and its revolutionary ideological strength, we and the working people of the world have a solid foundation to mobilize the masses in a timely manner to carry out an uncompromising struggle against the forces of aggression and imperialism and for a lasting and just peace among all countries.
    The Communist Party believes that its responsibility is to further strengthen the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, to work actively and diligently for world peace, and to give warm support to all people who are fighting to avoid another world war and to consolidate a stable and lasting peace.

    (II)
    Lenin theoretically confirmed the possibility of socialism first achieving victory in one country. The construction of socialism in the Soviet Union is the result of implementing Lenin's brilliant legacy, a brilliant achievement of the great organizational and guiding activities of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the result of the active and heroic creative labor of workers, peasants, and intellectuals.
    Lenin's immortal works include principled basic theoretical instructions on building a communist society in our country and on the gradual transition from socialism to communism—that is, from public ownership of the means of production and the principle of product distribution of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" to the implementation of the communist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."
    Lenin believed that maximizing the development of the productive forces of socialist society, continuously improving the material and technical foundations of socialism, and increasing labor productivity and producing abundant food and daily necessities are the decisive prerequisites for the gradual transition from socialist society to communist society.
    As early as 1902, Lenin put forward the task of "guaranteeing" the "greatest happiness and the all-round development of freedom" of all members of socialist society in the draft party program as the main goal of the social revolution.
    From the first days of the October Revolution, Lenin paid great attention to the issue of developing our country's productive forces.
    In April 1918, Lenin drafted a "Draft Plan for Scientific and Technical Work," in which he assigned the Academy of Sciences many important tasks of systematically studying and investigating the productive forces of Russia. Lenin gave the following instructions in this document:
    "Special attention should be paid to the electrification of industry and transportation and the application of electricity to agriculture. Utilize secondary fuels (peat, low-quality coal) in order to obtain electricity with the least expenditure in the extraction and transportation of fuel, hydropower and wind power engines and their application in agriculture."
    In the article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government," published in 1918, Lenin wrote:
    "We have sufficient materials in terms of natural wealth, human reserves, and the vast scale of mass creativity that has been sparked by the great revolution to build a truly prosperous Russia."
    Thirty years ago, our country only took the first steps in industrialization and overcoming the technical backwardness left over from the past, and overcoming the backwardness that was further aggravated by the destruction of foreign interventionists.
    Lenin believed that our country could be saved only if we victoriously developed our heavy industry before the imperialist countries attacked our country again.
    Our Party and the Soviet people have gloriously fulfilled this important instruction of Lenin. Our socialist motherland now possesses a fully developed heavy industry—a powerful foundation for national defense, and our entire national economy has developed. In the twenty-eight years since the 14th Party Congress, the Soviet Union's industrial production has increased twenty-eightfold. Steel production has increased twentyfold, coal eighteenfold, and electricity forty-fourfold. The production of machine manufacturing and the chemical industry has developed even faster.
    Now we have a source of energy even more powerful than electricity. Soviet scientists are studying how to use the enormous potential of atomic energy for communist construction and to benefit mankind, rather than using it to conquer and destroy mankind and destroy world civilization. The Soviet Union's undeniable technological and economic strength, its achievements in science and technology, have poured cold water on the heads of some people who are madly advocating anti-Soviet and anti-people's democratic countries' so-called "crusades."
    The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union summarized the brilliant achievements and victories of the Soviet people's struggle and formulated a plan for our country to continue to advance. The victorious implementation of the Party's national industrialization policy has prepared the necessary conditions for the rapid development of national agriculture and the expansion of light industry and food industry production. Today, a strong heavy industrial base has been laid and is being further developed. The losses suffered by heavy industry due to the German fascist aggression have been compensated for. Accelerating the development of light industry and daily necessities production has, for the first time in Soviet history, an objective possibility. The resolutions of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the historical resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and a series of resolutions subsequently formulated by the Party and the government, embody the great and comprehensive action program for further developing socialist agriculture and increasing the material welfare of the working people. The Communist Party and the Soviet government have led the people to vigorously develop agriculture and accelerate the development of light industry and the food industry in order to fully meet the growing needs of the people of the country for food and daily necessities in the next two or three years.
    The practical completion of these tasks is now the most important and indispensable part of communist construction. Our achievements in communist construction have not only domestic significance but also great international significance.
    American bourgeois newspapers have recently shown signs of anxiety about the Soviet Union's plan to expand the production of daily necessities. Some newspapers, such as the American "Business Daily," believe that Western European countries must compete with the Soviet Union in the "race to raise living standards." We ask: What is wrong with replacing the arms race that capitalist countries are engaged in with a peaceful economic competition aimed at raising living standards? Would the people oppose this "race to raise living standards"?
    After studying the prospects for the development of the world situation in the next twenty years and comparing the rapid economic development of the Soviet Union with the economic stagnation and decline of capitalist countries, the American magazine "The Reporter" found that the threat from the Soviet Union is not that the Soviet Union will attack anyone, but that, as the magazine wrote, "Russia is able to use part of its strength for the production of daily necessities as production develops, and purely use the attractiveness of setting an example to disturb Western Europe."
    Imperialist theorists understand that every new achievement we make in building communism and raising the living standards of the working people will have a huge impact on the minds and hearts of the people in capitalist countries and colonial countries. Lenin believed that the consolidated and unbreakable alliance between the working class and the peasants is the supreme principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He demanded that this alliance be supported as much as possible so that the working class could maintain its leading position and political power. Lenin's idea of an alliance between the working class and the laboring peasants is one of the most important foundations of Lenin's theory of proletarian revolution.
    The Party believes that its most important task is to tirelessly strengthen the alliance between the working class and the peasants—the foundation of our country's strength. Consistently implementing the great Lenin's principle of consolidating the alliance between the working class and the laboring peasants is of particular importance for communist construction. Successfully completing the huge tasks put forward by the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party will further strengthen the alliance between the working class and the collective farmers.
    Some of the specific measures implemented by the Party and the government in the recent period have provided greater economic incentives for collective farmers to develop animal husbandry, vegetable and potato cultivation, and other agricultural sectors. In doing so, the Party and the government are starting from Lenin's principled instructions, which Lenin once pointed out that material incentives are one of the basic principles of socialist management.
    Lenin taught that millions of people can be led to communism only when the enthusiasm aroused by the great revolution is combined with personal interests, personal interests, and economic accounting.
    Lenin especially emphasized that personal interests must be combined with the interests of the whole society and the interests of the country, and that personal interests must be subordinate to the interests of the entire people and the entire country. Our Party and the Soviet government are guided by these instructions of Lenin in building a communist society.
    Lenin created the idea of equality and friendship among all nationalities, on the basis of which the multi-ethnic Soviet state has developed and strengthened.
    The capitalist private system and capitalist production relations separate nationalities and countries, placing them in hostile, oppressive, and unequal relations. Socialist ownership and the socialist production relations developed on this basis unite and unite nationalities and countries according to the principles of brotherly friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance.
    The lofty ideas of equality and friendship among all nationalities implemented in the Soviet Union have opened up new prospects for the epoch-making development of mankind and have had a strong and irresistible impact on the consciousness of the people of all countries in the world.
    The Communist Party has united all nationalities of our country into a fraternal family—the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
    The friendship of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union is one of the main foundations of our powerful multi-ethnic socialist country. In brotherly cooperation, the people of all nationalities in our country have overcome the long-term backwardness in economy and culture, made unprecedented progress in the national economy, and developed a culture with a national form and socialist content. This is the result of our Party's consistent adherence to Lenin's ethnic policy.
    Stalin, Lenin's comrade-in-arms and the successor to Lenin's cause, worked tirelessly to strengthen the unbreakable friendship of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union; the cause of strengthening the friendship of the people of all nationalities has always been cared for by the Central Committee of the Party.
    Recently, the people of all nationalities in our country are celebrating the significant historical event of the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. The Russian and Ukrainian people, together with the people of all other nationalities in our country, are building a magnificent communist edifice in close cooperation. The friendship of the people of all nationalities is being increasingly consolidated and strengthened. Our Party unswervingly adheres to the Leninist-Stalinist ethnic policy and does not allow anyone to shake or weaken the great and unbreakable friendly relations of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Lenin foresaw that in the process of gradually transitioning to the advanced stage of communism, people's communist consciousness will also be improved. Lenin believed that improving communist consciousness and cultivating new people (for whom labor will become the primary necessity of life) is one of the basic conditions for transitioning to communism.

    (III)
    Lenin was the founder of a new type of Marxist party, the Leninist party, which proved that it could lead the proletariat to seize power, and which has led our people to the victory of socialism and is now successfully leading the construction of communism. This party stands at the forefront of the world revolution and liberation movement. Lenin laid the ideological, organizational, tactical, and theoretical foundations of the revolutionary Marxist party, and painstakingly cultivated the cadres of the party, who completed three revolutions. Lenin created a complete and harmonious doctrine about the party.
    Lenin believed that the Party is the conscious fighting vanguard of the working class, the leader and guide of the working people in the struggle against the forces of the old world and for the revolutionary socialist transformation of society, and he believed that the Party is the leading and guiding force of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In 1917, when the Party called on the working class to prepare for a decisive battle for the socialist revolution, Lenin inspiringly mentioned the lofty tasks and leadership role of the Communist Party. He wrote, "We believe in it, and in it we see the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our time."
    Lenin pointed out that without a battle-tested, steel-like party trusted by the working class and the non-proletarian working masses, the dictatorship of the proletariat would not last for a few months. Lenin taught us that the rock-solid unity of the party, the iron discipline within the party—a discipline based on the high ideological level of the communists, their consciousness, and their loyalty to the revolutionary cause—is the main prerequisite for our party to achieve victory in the struggle for the working class and for the cause of socialism and communism.
    An understanding of the objective and scientific laws of social development discovered by Marx and Lenin strengthens our confidence in the invincibility of our cause—the cause of communism.
    The Communist Party has won the full trust of the people with its entire history of activity over half a century. The non-Party working people regard the Communist Party as their loyal and reliable leader, as the strong defender of the fundamental interests of the people. The Communist Party expands and strengthens its ties with the broad masses. The Party is closely united with the people, preparing for the upcoming elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. There is no doubt that the Soviet people will warmly support the candidates of the alliance of the Communist Party and non-Party people.
    The principle of collective leadership of the Party is one of the main principles of the Leninist doctrine on the Party. Even before the revolution, Lenin called the Central Committee of the Party a collective of leaders, a maintainer and interpreter of the principles of the Party.
    Lenin pointed out that "The Central Committee safeguards the principles of the Party and interprets the principles of the Party at each Congress." Lenin always insisted on observing the strict norms of Party life stipulated in the Party Constitution.
    The collective experience and collective wisdom of the Central Committee are based on the scientific foundation of Marxist-Leninist theory, are based on the broad initiative of leading cadres and the creativity and initiative of the masses. This experience and wisdom ensures the correct leadership of the Party and the country.
    Marxism does not allow for the cult of the individual, which clearly violates the principle of collective leadership.
    The cult of the individual disregards the role of the Party and the role of the Party's leadership center, reduces the creative initiative of Party organizations and the Soviet people. This has nothing in common with the understanding of the great significance of the leadership work of political leaders and politicians in Marxism-Leninism.
    The activities of the Communist Party are guided by the instructions of Lenin and Stalin. Lenin and Stalin taught us that we must never ignore the mistakes and omissions that occur in our work, we must resolutely criticize the shortcomings in our Party, government and economic activities, in order to eliminate these shortcomings in a timely manner and strive to continuously improve our entire work. Only a strong and powerful party that relies on the trust and support of the people can boldly and openly expose shortcomings and correct shortcomings like our Communist Party.
    The great Communist Party is strong because of its rock-solid unity, because of the ideological and organizational unity of its ranks, because of its loyalty to Leninism, and because of its unbreakable ties with the people. The entire Party unanimously supports the resolutions of the July and September Plenary Sessions of the Central Committee of the Party. Loyal to the Leninist banner, Party organizations across the country express full support for the Central Committee of the Party, for this authoritative and wise collective of leaders, for the students and comrades-in-arms of Lenin and Stalin, who are leading our Party and our country along the Leninist road to new victories.
    Comrades! For fifty years, our Party has been at the forefront of the epoch-making struggle for the revolutionary transformation of human society.
    In the past half-century, our heroic Party has grown from a "small grain"—as Lenin compared it—to the great leadership force of the Soviet people. Among the Soviet people, there are approximately seven million Communists. The Communist Party is loyal to the doctrine of Leninism, it relies on the wholehearted support of the entire Soviet people, is resolutely and confidently solving the major problems of communist construction, and is waging an unyielding struggle for lasting peace.
    Long live our glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union!
    Long live the great Soviet people!
    Long live Leninism!

    苏联共产党中央委员会书记波斯伯洛夫
    关于列宁逝世三十周年的报告同志们！
    自从革命的天才、苏联共产党的缔造者、苏维埃社会主义国家的父亲、全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师乌拉季米尔·伊里奇·列宁逝世以来，到现在已经三十年了。
    三十年来，共产党一直在领导着苏联人民沿着列宁指出的正确道路前进。不朽的列宁主义思想照耀着苏联劳动人民建设共产主义社会的道路，它对整个世界历史的进程产生了巨大的影响，并鼓舞了全世界劳动人民为反对资本主义压迫，为建设新的、自由的生活，为争取国际和平与友谊而斗争。
    在列宁逝世后，列宁培养出来的共产党，在以列宁事业的伟大继承者约·维·斯大林为首的党中央委员会的领导下，粉碎了社会主义的敌人的一切进攻，维护了列宁主义，并保证了在我国建设世界上第一个社会主义社会的事业。尽管帝国主义反动势力力图设法扭转或阻挠历史的进程，但历史还是按照历史发展的客观规律、按照反映这些规律的不朽的、战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说前进的。和平、民主和社会主义阵营的力量一年比一年壮大；列宁的革命的科学预见的伟大、列宁所发现的现代社会的发展规律，得到了日益清楚的、日益令人信服的证明。
    （一）
    马克思发现了资产阶级社会发展的经济法则，他从它的起源、发展与衰落来研究资本主义社会的生产关系，并科学地证明了资本主义趋向死亡、和资本主义社会转到社会主义社会的革命性转变的必然性。
    在新历史时代的情况下，当资本主义发展到最高阶段——帝国主义阶段的时候，当垄断资本的控制已经建立起来的时候，列宁对于帝国主义作为资本主义最后阶段的经济与政治本质作了精辟的、科学的分析。列宁发现了资本主义在帝国主义阶段经济与政治发展不平衡的规律，以及从而产生的社会主义在几个国家甚至在一个国家内首先获得胜利的可能性。
    根据列宁的定义，帝国主义的经济本质在于垄断代替自由竞争，这种垄断表现在托辣斯、辛迪加和势力庞大的银行的垄断一切，表现在对原料资源的掠夺与收买。列宁说：“问题的中心在于经济垄断。”追求最大限度的垄断性的高利润，是经济垄断的特征。列宁的这些经典的论点，从本质上揭示了帝国主义基本经济法则的出发点。
    列宁认为，从民主主义到政治反动是垄断资本主义政治上层建筑的特色。他指出，在国内国外政策上的加紧反动，加紧民族压迫，帝国主义破坏其他民族与国家的政治与民族独立的企图以及资本主义国家重新瓜分世界的斗争，都是资本主义垄断的特征。
    垄断资本的帝国主义压迫愈大，工人阶级与殖民地及半殖民地被压迫人民的抵抗就愈强烈，民族独立与国家主权遭到帝国主义破坏的人民的抵抗就愈强烈。各国人民对帝国主义政策、对帝国主义压迫的抵抗的日益强烈，就是帝国主义的致命弱点。近年来的事实与发展清楚地说明：在世界资本主义市场的贸易中引起了不能解决的矛盾的资本主义垄断资本对最大限度利润的追求，以及必然引起各国人民的反抗的镇压其他国家的民族独立运动的政策，正在加深着整个资本主义制度的总危机。
    根据对广泛的材料所作的实际分析，根据对第一次世界大战给人民带来的后果所作的理论总结，列宁科学地证明了十九世纪末一直向上发展的资本主义，在帝国主义时代已经变成寄生的、垂死的资本主义，它把人类赶到一次又一次的血腥战争与经济灾难的深渊里去。
    列宁在他的著作中一再着重指出，资产阶级政治领袖无法了解帝国主义战争的最重要的后果和结局。战争的后果打开了千百万被资产阶级践踏、摧残、欺骗和蒙蔽的人的眼睛。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命生动地证实了列宁的革命理论。在列宁和列宁的党的英明领导下，俄国无产阶级和革命的农民结成联盟，和以前受压迫的各族人民结成联盟，完成了历史上最伟大的事业——首先突破了世界帝国主义的阵线，首先建立了无产阶级专政，并在世界历史上展开了一个新的纪元，社会主义胜利的纪元。
    要推翻在俄国的帝国主义势力并使国家退出帝国主义战争，这就需要列宁的光辉的革命天才，列宁的党的最伟大的英雄气概和百折不挠的精神，以及俄国广大群众的革命力量的巨大高涨。
    列宁所缔造的伟大的党，扫除了叫嚷俄国无产阶级是俄国人民中的少数并硬说它还“没有成熟”到足以进行社会主义革命的孟什维克，勇敢地、满怀信心地领导工人阶级和它的革命同盟者劳动农民推翻了帝国主义势力，引导他们取得了一九一七年十月社会主义革命的胜利。
    列宁天才地预断说，教育并训练世界上的多数人学会斗争的，毕竟还是资本主义本身和帝国主义不断增长的矛盾。他预言道，世界上大多数人正以不同寻常的速度被吸引到争取他们解放的斗争中。列宁毫不怀疑，社会主义的最后胜利是充分地、绝对地有保证的。
    整个历史的发展已证实，而且正在证实列宁的科学预见。苏联人民在以革命的方式创造了迅速发展生产力的必要条件之后，又在列宁的党的领导下，在我国建立了社会主义的社会，击溃了德国法西斯主义和日本军国主义。由于在第二次世界大战中击败了德国法西斯主义和日本军国主义，欧洲的许多国家和伟大的中华人民共和国脱离了帝国主义体系，从而形成强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营。
    在内战和外国干涉结束之后，列宁指出，我们的国家取得了在一整个时期里和资本主义国家和平共处的可能。列宁同时警告说，帝国主义者是不会放弃他们的阴谋的，因此，我们必须坚定不移地加强我们社会主义祖国的国防。
    列宁强调说，苏联政府始终不变地愿意和资本主义国家——其中包括美国——建立正常的外交和贸易关系。
    一九二○年，美国一家报纸的记者向列宁提出问题，问什么是和美国建立和平的基础，列宁在他的有名的答复中说：
    “让美国资本家不要触犯我们。我们也不会触犯他们。我们还甚至愿意出金子去买机器、工具等一切运输和工业所需要的东西，不单是用金子而且还用原料。”（“列宁全集”第三十卷，第三四○页）
    列宁屡次说到愿意和英国和法国建立友好关系。列宁在一九二二年接见英国“曼彻斯特卫报”记者回答关于苏联与英国及法国合作的前途问题时指出：“我们认为和这两个国家建立十分友好的关系是十分可能的，这是我们的目标……。我们认为，可以被正确地理解的英法利益，也将同样在这方面起作用”。（“列宁全集”第三十三卷，第三四六页）
    列宁的这些话揭露了帝国主义阵营中敌人的诽谤，他们说，苏联政府“不愿意”和资本主义国家建立正常关系。列宁特别重视苏联和资产阶级国家的贸易关系，他认为这是促进两种制度长期和平共处的主要因素之一。列宁指出，资本主义国家因为经济困难最后不免要和苏联建立贸易关系。列宁说：“有一种力量比任何敌对政府和阶级的愿望、意志和决定更强有力。这就是普遍的全世界的经济关系，这种力量迫使他们走上和我们建立关系的道路。”（“列宁全集”第三十三卷，第一二九页）
    苏联共产党和政府过去和现在一直遵循着我们伟大的导师列宁的关于我国可能与资本主义国家长期和平共处的学说。列宁关于两个制度——社会主义和资本主义——可能长期和平共处和经济合作的学说，是苏联政府所坚持的争取稳固的持久的和平、争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争的基本原则。为了使所有悬而未决的争端得到和平解决，苏联政府已作了一切必要的努力。
    苏联政府争取持久和稳固的和平，争取巩固国际安全的不屈不挠的斗争，得到全体进步人类的支持和同情。目前，在各国展开的、强大而有组织的和平运动，最鲜明地证明了列宁的话：“我们的和平政策是得到世界上绝大多数人民的赞同的。”（“列宁全集”第三十卷，第三六五页）
    列宁主义是全体进步人类反对帝国主义、争取和平、争取各国人民之间的友谊和各国人民的光明灿烂的前途的斗争的旗帜。依靠列宁主义及其革命的思想力量，我们和全世界的劳动人民就有了一个坚固的基础来及时地动员群众，为反对侵略势力和帝国主义势力，为争取一切国家之间持久而正义的和平而进行不妥协的斗争。
    共产党认为，它的责任就是更进一步加强和平、民主和社会主义阵营，为世界和平而积极和努力地工作，并给为避免另一次世界大战和为稳固和持久的和平而斗争的一切人民以热烈的支持。

    列宁从理论上证实了社会主义首先在一个国家取得胜利的可能性。苏联建成社会主义，是实行列宁英明的遗训的结果，是苏联共产党的巨大的组织和指导活动的辉煌成就，是工人、农民和知识分子积极的、英雄的创造性劳动的成果。
    列宁的不朽著作中包括有关于在我国建设共产主义社会、关于从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义——就是从生产资料公有制和“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的产品分配原则过渡到实行“各尽所能，各取所需”的共产主义原则——的方法的原则性的基本理论指示。
    列宁认为最大限度地发展社会主义社会的生产力，使社会主义的物质和技术基础不断完善，提高劳动生产率和生产丰裕的食品和日用品，是从社会主义社会逐渐过渡到共产主义社会的决定性的先决条件。
    早在一九零二年，列宁就在党纲草案中提出了
  “保证”社会主义社会一切成员的“最大幸福和自由的全面发展”的任务，作为社会革命的主要目标。
    从十月革命的头几天起，列宁对于发展我国生产力的问题就予以很大的注意。
    一九一八年四月，列宁拟订了一个“科学技术工作计划草案”，在这个计划中，他为科学院规定了有系统地研究和调查俄国的生产力的许多重要任务。列宁在这个文件中作了如下的指示：
    “要特别注意工业和运输业的电气化以及把电力应用于农业。利用次等燃料（泥炭、质量较差的煤）以便在开采和运送燃料上用最少的花费来取得电力，水力和风力发动机及其在农业中的应用。”
    在一九一八年发表的“现时的主要任务”一文中，列宁写道：
      “我们在天然财富方面，在人力后备方面，在大革命发扬起来的巨大规模的民众创造力方面——都有足够的材料来建立真正富强的俄罗斯。”
    三十年以前，我们国家在工业化和克服过去遗留下来的技术落后方面，在克服由于外国干涉者的破坏而更加严重的落后方面才走了头几步。
    列宁认为，只有在帝国主义国家再度攻击我们国家之前胜利地发展我们的重工业，我们的国家才能得救。
    我们的党和苏联人民光荣地完成了列宁的这个重要的训示。我们的社会主义祖国现在拥有充分发展的重工业——强大的国防基础，我们的整个国民经济都有了发展。在从第十四次党代表大会以来的二十八年中，苏联的工业生产增加了二十八倍。钢产量增加了二十倍，煤十八倍，电力四十四倍。机器制造和化学工业的生产发展得更快。
    现在我们有了一种比电更为强大的能的来源。苏联科学家们正在研究怎样利用巨大的潜在原子能来从事共产主义建设，来为人类谋福利，而不把它用来征服和消灭人类和毁灭世界文明。苏联的无可否认的技术与经济力量，它在科学与技术方面的成就，在某些疯狂鼓吹反苏和反人民民主国家的所谓“十字军”的人们的头上泼了一瓢冷水。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会总结了苏联人民斗争的辉煌成绩和胜利，并制订了我国继续前进的计划。党的国家工业化政策的胜利实施，为全国农业的迅速发展和轻工业、食品工业生产的扩大，准备了必要条件。今天，强大的重工业基础已经奠立并在进一步发展，德国法西斯侵略使重工业蒙受的损失已经弥补，加速发展轻工业和日用品生产在苏维埃历史上第一次有了客观可能性。苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议的决议，苏联共产党中央委员会九月全体会议的具有历史意义的决议，以及后来党和政府所制订的一系列决议，都体现了进一步发展社会主义农业和增进劳动人民物质福利的伟大的、全面的行动纲领。共产党和苏联政府已经领导人民来大力发展农业，加速发展轻工业和食品工业，以便在今后两三年内充分满足全国人民对食品和日用品的日益增长的需要。
    实际完成这些任务，在现在是共产主义建设的一个最重要的、不可缺少的部分。我们在共产主义建设中的成就，不但具有国内意义，而且具有重大的国际意义。
    对苏联扩大日用品生产的计划，美国资产阶级报纸上近来表现了忧虑的迹象。有些报纸如美国的“商务日报”认为，西欧国家必须在“提高生活水平的竞赛”中与苏联竞争。我们试问：如果用旨在提高生活水平的和平经济竞赛来代替资本主义国家正在进行的军备竞赛，那又有什么坏处呢？人民会反对这种“提高生活水平的竞赛”吗？
    在研究了今后二十年世界形势发展的前途并将苏联经济高速发展的情况和资本主义国家经济停滞和衰落的情况作了比较后，美国杂志“报道者”发现，苏联的威胁并不是苏联将攻击任何人，而是，正如该杂志写道，“俄国能够随着生产的发展而把一部分力量用于日用品生产，纯粹用树立范例的吸引力来扰乱西欧。”
    帝国主义理论家了解到，我们在建设共产主义和提高劳动人民生活水平方面所取得的每一个新成就，都会在资本主义国家和殖民地国家人民的思想和心目中产生巨大的影响。列宁认为，工人阶级和农民的巩固的牢不可破的联盟是无产阶级专政的最高原则。他要求尽量支持这一联盟，以便工人阶级能够保持它的领导地位和政权。列宁关于工人阶级和劳动农民联盟的思想，是列宁关于无产阶级革命理论最重要的基础之
  一。
    党认为它的最重要的任务就是不倦地加强工人阶级和农民的联盟——我国的力量的基础。一贯执行伟大的列宁关于巩固工人阶级与劳动农民的联盟的原则，对共产主义的建设具有特别重要的意义。胜利地完成党中央委员会九月全体会议所提出的巨大的任务，将进一步加强工人阶级和集体农民的联盟。
    党和政府在最近期间所实施的一些具体措施，对集体农民发展饲畜业、蔬菜和马铃薯种植业这些农业部门提供了更大的经济上的鼓励。在这样做时，党和政府是从列宁的原则指示出发的，列宁曾经指出，物质鼓励是社会主义经营的基本原则之一。
    列宁教导说，只有当广大群众因大革命所激发的热忱同个人利益、个人兴趣和经济核算相结合的时候，千百万人民才能被引导到共产主义。
    列宁特别着重指出，必须把个人利益和整个社会的利益、和国家的利益结合起来，必须使个人利益服从全体人民和整个国家的利益。我们党和苏维埃政府在建设共产主义社会的时候，是以列宁的这些指示作为指导的。
    列宁创造了各民族平等和友好的思想，在这种思想的基础上，多民族的苏维埃国家得到了发展并且加强了。
    资本主义私有制度、资本主义生产关系分离了各民族、各国家，使它们处于敌对、压迫和不平等的关系中。而社会主义所有制以及在这个基础上发展的社会主义生产关系，则根据兄弟友好、合作和互助的原则团结并联合了各民族、各国家。
    苏联实行的各民族平等和友好的崇高的思想，为人类的划时代发展开辟了新的远景，并且在全世界各国人民的意识中起了强烈的、不可抗拒的影响。
    共产党把我们国家的各民族团结成一个兄弟般的家庭——伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟。
    苏联各族人民的友谊，是我们强大的多民族社会主义国家的主要基础之一。我国各族人民在兄弟般的合作中克服了长期以来在经济和文化上的落后现象，使国民经济获得了空前的高涨，并发展了民族形式、社会主义内容的文化。这是我们党一贯奉行列宁的民族政策的结果。
    列宁的战友和列宁事业的继承者斯大林不倦地为加强苏联各族人民的牢不可破的友谊而努力；加强各族人民的友谊的事业经常受到党中央委员会的关怀。
    最近我国各族人民正在庆祝乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年这个意义重大的历史事件。俄罗斯与乌克兰人民，和我国其他各族人民一道，在密切合作中正在建设宏伟的共产主义大厦。各族人民的友谊正在日益巩固和加强。我们的党坚持不渝地奉行列宁—斯大林民族政策，不让任何人来动摇或削弱苏联各族人民牢不可破的伟大的友好关系。列宁预见到，在逐步过渡到共产主义高级阶段的过程中，人们的共产主义觉悟也将随着提高。列宁认为，提高共产主义觉悟和培养新人（对他们说来劳动将成为生活的首要的必需的东西）是过渡到共产主义的基本条件之一。
      （三）
    列宁是新型马克思主义党、列宁主义党的缔造者，这个党证明了它能够领导无产阶级夺取政权，这个党已领导我国人民取得了社会主义的胜利，现在正在顺利地领导着共产主义建设。这个党走在世界革命和解放运动的最前列。列宁奠定了革命的马克思主义党的思想上、组织上、策略上和理论上的基础，并苦心地培养了党的干部，这些干部完成了三次革命。列宁创造了一套完整的和谐的关于党的学说。
    列宁认为党是工人阶级觉悟的战斗先锋队，是劳动人民在反对旧世界势力和争取对社会实行革命社会主义改造的斗争中的领导者和指导者，他认为党是无产阶级专政的领导和指导力量。在一九一七年，当党号召工人阶级准备为社会主义革命进行决定性的战斗的时候，列宁启发性地提到共产党的崇高任务和领导作用，他写道：“我们相信它，在它身上我们看到了我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心。”
    列宁指出，没有一个为工人阶级和非无产阶级劳动群众所信任的、经过战斗锻炼的钢铁般的党，那么无产阶级专政就支持不了几个月。列宁教导我们，党的磐石般的团结，党内铁的纪律——这种纪律的基础是共产党员的高度的思想水平，是他们的觉悟和对革命事业的忠诚——是我们党在为工人阶级为社会主义和共产主义事业而进行的斗争取得胜利的主要的先决条件。
    对马克思和列宁所发现的客观的、科学的社会发展规律的了解，加强了我们对我们的事业——共产主义事业不可战胜的信心。
    共产党以其半个世纪的全部历史活动取得了人民的充分信任。非党劳动人民把共产党当作是他们的忠实、可靠的领导者，当作是人民根本利益的坚强保卫者。共产党扩大并加强它与广大群众的联系。党正与人民紧密地团结在一起，筹备即将举行的苏联最高苏维埃选举。毫无疑问，苏联人民会热诚地拥护共产党和非党人民联盟的候选人。
    党的集体领导原则是列宁主义关于党的学说的主要原则之一。还在革命以前，列宁就把党的中央委员会称作领导者的集体，称作党的原则的维护者和解释者。
    列宁指出，“中央委员会在每次代表大会上维护党的原则，并解释党的原则。”列宁始终坚持要遵守党章中所规定的严格的党生活的规范。
    中央委员会的集体经验和集体智慧是建立在马克思列宁主义学说的科学基础上的，是建立在领导干部的广泛的主动性以及群众的创造力和积极性的基础上的，这种经验和智慧保证对党和国家的正确领导。
    马克思主义是不容许个人崇拜的，这种崇拜显然违反集体领导的原则。
    个人崇拜无视党的作用和党的领导中心的作用，降低党组织和苏联人民的创造积极性，这与马克思列宁主义对于政治领袖和政治家的领导工作的重大意义的了解毫无共同之处。
    共产党的活动是以列宁与斯大林的指示为指南的。列宁与斯大林教导我们，决不能忽略工作中发生的错误与疏忽，必须坚决地批评我们党的、政府的与经济的活动中的缺点，以便及时消灭这些缺点，为不断提高我们整个的工作而努力。只有一个依靠人民的信任与支持的强大而有力的政党，才能像我们共产党一样大胆地、公开地揭露缺点，纠正缺点。
      伟大的共产党由于磐石般坚固的团结，由于它的队伍在思想上与组织上的团结一致，由于它对列宁主义的忠诚，由于它与人民有着牢不可破的联系，因此是强大的。全党一致拥护党中央委员会七月和九月全体会议的决议。忠于列宁主义旗帜的全国各地的党组织表示充分支持党中央委员会，支持这个权威的、英明的领导者的集体，支持列宁和斯大林的学生与战友们，他们正领导我们的党与国家沿着列宁主义的道路走向新的胜利。
    同志们！五十年以来，我们的党一直走在争取人类社会的革命性转变的划时代斗争的最前列。
    在过去半个世纪中，我们的英雄的党已经从一颗“小谷粒”——如列宁所比喻的——成长为苏联人民的伟大的领导力量，在苏联人民中，大约有七百万共产党员。共产党忠于列宁主义的学说，它依靠全苏联人民的全心全意的支持，正在坚决地、满怀信心地解决共产主义建设的重大问题，并为持久和平进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    我们光荣的苏联共产党万岁！
    伟大的苏联人民万岁！
    列宁主义万岁！
