Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 29th: The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States held a meeting on the 28th to continue discussing the first item on the agenda: "Measures to ease international tension and the convening of a meeting of the foreign ministers of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China." Molotov was the chairman.

　　In his speech on the 28th, Dulles no longer put forward anything resembling arguments, but attacked the policies of the Soviet Union and China with the standard American propaganda that everyone was already tired of. Dulles also made a particularly despicable attack on the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China.

　　Dulles arbitrarily tampered with many provisions of the United Nations Charter and other international agreements, attempting once again to futilely defend the policy of not allowing the People's Republic of China to participate in the study and resolution of international issues that cause international tension. Dulles finally suggested turning to discuss other items on the agenda.

　　Bidault then spoke. He once again admitted that the United Nations Charter stipulates that the five major powers, including the People's Republic of China, have a special responsibility for maintaining peace and security. However, he repeated the already refuted argument, insisting that the policies pursued by the People's Republic of China were not in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Referring to the decision made at the Potsdam Conference to establish a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five major powers, Bidault said that the establishment of this meeting was to carry out "certain tasks," and the members of this meeting should change according to the tasks it bears. Making such a remark was obviously intended to diminish the right and role of the great People's Republic of China in resolving international issues, as well as to diminish the urgent need to convene a meeting of the five major powers.

　　When discussing economic issues that should be discussed at the meeting of the five major powers, Bidault acknowledged that the restoration of a unified world market is of great significance for improving the welfare of all countries. However, he insisted that China itself was guilty of undermining trade relations and denied that China had the need to participate in the study of this urgent issue.

　　Bidault insisted that China was engaged in armed intervention in the Indochina War, and that this situation prevented inviting China to participate in discussions of political issues. Bidault said: However, even now, the French government is prepared to seize the opportunity to establish peace in Indochina with the full consent of the "member states of the Federation." However, he groundlessly repeated that China had not shown sincerity in seeking peace.

　　Bidault finally spoke about Asian issues. He repeated the reasons he had already discussed on the 27th, attempting to determine that a peaceful settlement of Asian issues was possible without holding a meeting of the five major powers. Bidault concluded by saying: Although there are differences of opinion between the Soviet Union and other participants in the meeting on this issue, from the discussion of the first item on the agenda, there is no reason to believe that it is impossible to bring each other's views closer on some issues.

　　Eden then spoke. He refuted Molotov's opinion that the meeting of the five major powers could study major international issues, as well as issues involving the Asian situation. Eden insisted that this suggestion was "impractical." He went on to say that issues such as disarmament and the development of international trade involved many countries, so they should be discussed by the United Nations, rather than at a meeting of the five major powers. He specifically mentioned that he did not believe that the meeting of the five major powers could find the right way to expand international trade.

　　Eden stated that his views on how to discuss the issues of Korea and Indochina were the same as Bidault's.

　　Eden said: If this meeting focuses on discussing these issues, then I believe that it can make a practical contribution. But, he said: We must seriously consider all the issues. Therefore, I suggest to the three foreign ministers that after we have finished speaking, we should stop continuing the discussion of the first item on the agenda and turn to discussing issues exclusively for Europe, namely the second and third items on the agenda. This will allow us to have more time to exchange views. I hope that doing so will have good results. Later, we can re-discuss the first item on the agenda. I hope that if we can make progress on other items, then the meeting will be more likely to reach a conclusion on the first item.

　　Molotov then spoke. He said: In the process of exchanging views, not enough attention has been paid to the main point of the first item on the agenda. This is the issue of easing international tension. Precisely because this issue is of great significance to the four countries participating in this meeting, and not just the four countries, the Soviet delegation believes that the meeting should first focus its attention on this issue.

　　Molotov proved that there was no basis for the attempt to portray the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a meeting of the five major powers as undermining the United Nations Charter and replacing the United Nations with a meeting of the five major powers. Molotov said: Mr. Dulles said that he looked at the United Nations Charter early this morning. Of course, when necessary, each of us must concentrate on looking at the United Nations Charter in the morning, and sometimes at night as well.

　　Precisely because the United Nations Charter is good, it is beneficial to look at it, and the Soviet Union advocates that it cannot be changed. We hope that since the United States values the United Nations Charter so highly, it should also support our proposal to implement the Charter rather than amend it.

　　Molotov went on to say: In addition to the United Nations Charter, there are also resolutions adopted by the previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, especially the appeal adopted by the Third United Nations General Assembly in 1948, which called on the major powers to resume efforts to reconcile differences and establish lasting peace. The Fifth United Nations General Assembly also adopted a resolution recommending that the permanent members of the Security Council hold meetings, together with other relevant countries if necessary, to discuss all issues that may endanger international peace and hinder the work of the United Nations, in order to eliminate fundamental differences and reach agreements in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Charter.

　　Molotov pointed out: This resolution was unanimously adopted on November 3, 1950, that is, one year after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet representative's proposal to convene a meeting of the five major powers is in line with these two resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly.

　　Molotov pointed out: Naturally, it is not necessary to require the five-country meeting to discuss all major political, economic, and military issues at the same time, although in principle this is correct. However, discussing economic issues such as the development of international trade at a meeting with the participation of the People's Republic of China is of no small significance. Such discussions will help ease international tensions, and of course, may also end shameful actions such as the embargo against China. Of course, it is difficult to maintain discriminatory policies and policies that restrict and undermine normal international trade at this meeting. However, this meeting will help the development of trade between large and small countries that want to trade. If any country is unwilling to develop trade, that is its own business. The important thing is: it should not prevent other countries from trading.

　　Regarding the insistence that the issue of disarmament is a matter for the United Nations, not the five major powers, Molotov said: In fact, studying the above-mentioned issue is not only a matter for the United Nations, but also a matter for the major powers. If these countries are aware of their responsibility for disarmament, they should actively and proactively solve this problem. Molotov cited the proposal submitted by Britain, the United States, and France to the United Nations Disarmament Commission on May 28, 1952, which advocated limiting the number of armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, China, as well as Britain and France. Molotov said: Therefore, we have reason to say that the issue of disarmament by major powers is also related to China, because the above-mentioned proposal directly mentioned China. Molotov emphasized: Can't we promote the solution of this problem at the five-country meeting? The Soviet delegation intends to submit its own proposal on the issue of disarmament at this four-country meeting.

　　Molotov mentioned Dulles' attacks on the People's Republic of China, especially on Zhou Enlai, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, saying: It is a pity that the representatives of the People's Republic of China are not here. I have no doubt that if they were here, they would give these words the answer they deserve. I think it is neither very fair nor very convincing to harshly criticize China when the representatives of the People's Republic of China are not present. Molotov refuted Dulles' and Bidault's slander against the People's Republic of China. He said: If Dulles and Bidault look at the facts and study the real situation, they will realize that China is a victim of aggression, and the security of China's borders has been genuinely threatened. There is no reason to slander the People's Republic of China as an aggressor. The establishment of this country is a great achievement of the Chinese people. For the first time in many centuries, the Chinese people have united into a unified country, and they are proud of this country. The People's Republic of China knows who should be condemned and who has insulted it, because some countries have done some injustice to it. However, China itself is willing to maintain normal political and economic relations with all other countries and develop such relations on an equal footing.

　　Molotov said: Although the meeting has not fully discussed all the issues raised, some conclusions can still be drawn. We can point out that the proposal to convene a meeting of the five major powers has not been rejected by anyone. On the other hand, everyone has expressed various opinions on the purpose of this meeting. In this regard, it cannot be said that we have reached an agreement, so further research is needed. If some agreement can be reached on this basis, then I think this is progress in our work.

　　Dulles then spoke, saying: The United States does not agree with the principle of convening a meeting of the five major powers with the participation of the People's Republic of China, but does not object to meeting with representatives of the People's Republic of China to deal with issues that should be discussed, such as the Korean issue. But this meeting cannot be a meeting of the five major powers. Dulles suggested temporarily stopping the discussion of this issue and turning to the discussion of other issues on the agenda, and this issue can be discussed later.

　　Bidault said: The principle of having all countries related to certain specific issues negotiate on Asian issues should be adopted. As for the nature of the negotiations, the members participating in the negotiations, and the issues that should be discussed, further discussion is needed, and some time is needed for consideration.

　　Molotov pointed out: On the one hand, no agreement has been reached on the issues under discussion; on the other hand, some people hope to continue to seek an agreement. He suggested immediately establishing a committee to help reach an agreement. In this way, the ministers can deal with other issues and listen to the work report of this committee at an appropriate time.

　　Eden once again suggested temporarily stopping the discussion of the first item on the agenda, turning to the discussion of the second and third items on the agenda, and resuming the discussion of the first item on the agenda after some time.

　　The foreign ministers of the United States, France, and Britain opposed the establishment of a committee. They said that they would rather continue to discuss the issue of convening a meeting of the five major powers by the four foreign ministers themselves. Dulles suggested holding a secret meeting without the participation of advisors next week for this purpose. As for the issue of establishing a committee, he suggested waiting until an agreement is reached in principle before discussing it. Bidault and Eden supported Dulles' opinion.

　　Molotov said: Since some people currently express doubts about the necessity of establishing a committee, the Soviet delegation reserves the right to raise this issue at the meeting mentioned by Dulles, Bidault, and Eden.

　　The foreign ministers agreed on this point.

　　Before the meeting adjourned, Molotov handed over the Soviet delegation's proposal on the issue of disarmament to the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France. The proposal is as follows:

　　On Convening a World General Disarmament Conference

　　The governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, wishing to ensure peace and ease international tension, believe that it is necessary to take appropriate measures to alleviate the heavy financial burden borne by the people of all countries due to the expansion of armaments. Therefore, they reached an agreement: the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France will take measures within the framework of the United Nations to convene a World General Disarmament Conference in 1954 with the participation of member states and non-member states of the United Nations, and it has been fully agreed that the plan for measures for general disarmament should be coordinated with the simultaneous resolution of the issue of atomic weapons.
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 28th: More than two hundred Soviet and foreign journalists attended a press conference held at the Press Building in the democratic sector of Berlin on the 27th.

　　Le.F. Ilyichev, Director of the Press Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, briefly reported on the third meeting of the four foreign ministers. He also introduced to the journalists the speeches of the foreign ministers of the three Western countries on the first item on the agenda that was unanimously agreed upon at the previous meeting. The journalists listened with great attention to the detailed introduction of the content of V.M. Molotov's speech on the first item on the agenda.

　　Ilyichev also announced at the press conference: On January 27, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov handed over the letter from the government of the German Democratic Republic to the four foreign ministers to the British Foreign Secretary, An. Eden, who was the chairman of the meeting that day, and hoped that the foreign ministers' meeting could discuss it at an appropriate time. The letter requested that the foreign ministers' meeting invite representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to participate in the discussion of the German issue. Copies of the letter have been given to the French Foreign Minister and the United States Secretary of State, respectively.

　　Ilyichev answered questions raised by foreign journalists.
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 29th: On the evening of January 28, Le.F. Ilyichev, Director of the Press Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, introduced to journalists the content of Molotov's proposal on convening a world general disarmament conference at a press conference held for Soviet and foreign journalists in the Press Building in the democratic sector of Berlin. At the press conference, he read out this proposal, which aroused great interest among the journalists, in English, French, and German. Then, Ilyichev described in detail the situation of the meeting on the 28th to the journalists.

### 苏、法、英、美四国外长会议继续举行会议  莫洛托夫提议召开世界普遍裁军会议  四国外长将进一步讨论召开五大国会议的问题

　　苏、法、英、美四国外长会议继续举行会议
　　莫洛托夫提议召开世界普遍裁军会议
　　四国外长将进一步讨论召开五大国会议的问题
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十九日讯：苏、法、英、美四国外长会议于二十八日举行会议，继续讨论议程第一项：“关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联、中华人民共和国的外长会议”。担任主席的是莫洛托夫。
    杜勒斯在二十八日的发言中已不再提出任何像是论据的东西，而用大家早就厌烦了的标准的美国式的宣传，来攻击苏联和中国的政策。杜勒斯还特别卑鄙地攻击了中华人民共和国外交部部长。
    杜勒斯任意窜改联合国宪章和其他国际协定的好些条文，企图再一次枉费心机地为不让中华人民共和国参与研究和解决引起国际紧张局势的国际问题这一政策辩护。杜勒斯最后建议转而讨论议程的其他各项。
    皮杜尔接着发言。他又一次承认，联合国宪章规定包括中华人民共和国在内的五大国有维护和平与安全的特别责任。但他仍重复了早就被驳倒了的说法，硬说中华人民共和国奉行的政策是不符合联合国宪章的原则的。皮杜尔在谈到波茨坦会议曾决定设立五大国外长会议时说，这个会议的设立是为了执行“一定的任务”，这个会议的成员应该随这个会议所负担的任务而改变。发出这种议论，显然是为了缩小伟大的中华人民共和国解决国际问题的权利和作用以及缩小召开五大国会议的迫切需要。
    皮杜尔谈到应当在五大国会议上讨论的经济问题时，承认统一的世界市场的恢复对于增进各国的福利具有重大意义。但是，他硬说中国自己犯了破坏贸易关系的罪，并否认中国有参与研究这个迫切问题的必要。
    皮杜尔硬说中国武装干涉印度支那战争，说这种情况阻碍了邀请中国参加讨论政治问题。皮杜尔说：但是法国政府即便在目前还是准备利用机会，在“联邦成员国”的完全同意下建立印度支那的和平。但是，他又毫无根据地重复说，中国没有表明谋取和平的诚意。
    皮杜尔最后讲到亚洲问题。他重复了他在二十七日已经谈过的理由，企图断定：不举行五大国会议，亚洲问题的和平解决也是可能达成的。皮杜尔最后说：尽管苏联和会议的其他参加者之间在这个问题上意见不同，但是，从议程第一项的讨论情形来看，没有理由认为在有些问题上彼此的观点不可能接近。
    艾登接着发言。他反驳了莫洛托夫这样的意见：五大国会议可以研究主要的国际问题，也可以研究涉及亚洲局势的问题。艾登硬说这个建议是
  “不切实际的”。他接着说道，像裁减军备和发展国际贸易这样的问题涉及许多国家，所以应该由联合国去讨论，而不应在五大国会议上讨论。他特别提到，他不相信五大国会议能够找出扩大国际贸易问题的正确途径。
    艾登表示，对于如何讨论朝鲜和印度支那问题，他和皮杜尔的意见相同。
    艾登说：如果这次会议专心来讨论这些问题，那我相信，是能作出实际的贡献的。但是，他说：我们必须认真地去考虑所有的问题。因此，我向三位外长提出建议，在我们结束了发言以后，就停止继续讨论议程第一项，转而讨论专属欧洲的问题，即议程的第二项和第三项。这样就能使我们有进一步交换意见的时间。我希望，这样做会有好的效果。以后，我们可以重新讨论议程的第一项。我希望，我们在其他项目上能有进展，那么会议就会更有可能在第一项上得出结论。
    接着莫洛托夫发言。他说：在交换意见的过程中，对于第一项议程的主要一点，没有给以足够的注意。这就是缓和国际紧张局势的问题。正因为这一问题对参加这次会议的四国，而且还不仅是四国，都具有重大的意义，苏联代表团认为会议首先应该把注意力集中在这个问题上。
    莫洛托夫证明，有人企图把苏联要求召开五大国会议的建议说成是破坏联合国宪章和以五大国会议代替联合国，这种说法是没有根据的。莫洛托夫说：杜勒斯先生说，他今天一清早就看过了联合国宪章。当然，有必要的时候，我们每个人在早上都要聚精会神地看看联合国宪章，有时晚上也要看。
    正因为联合国宪章是好的，看它是有益处的，苏联主张不能把它变更。我们希望，美国既然把联合国宪章估计得这样高，也就应当支持我们要求实现宪章而不是修改宪章的主张。
    莫洛托夫接着说：除了联合国宪章外，还有联合国历届大会所通过的决议，特别是一九四八年联合国第三届大会所通过的呼吁，这个呼吁要求各大国恢复努力，以便调协分歧，并且建立持久和平。联合国第五届大会又通过了一项决议，建议安全理事会各常任理事国举行会议，在必要时和其他有关国家在一起，共同讨论所有可能危及国际和平与妨碍联合国工作的问题，以求消除基本的分歧，并按照宪章的文字和精神达成协议。
    莫洛托夫指出：这个决议是在一九五○年十一月三日，即中华人民共和国成立已经一年的时候，一致通过的。苏联代表关于召开五大国会议的建议，正符合联合国大会的这两个决议。
    莫洛托夫指出：自然不必要求五国会议同时讨论所有的重大政治、经济和军事问题，虽然在原则上这是对的。但是，在有中华人民共和国参加的会上讨论像发展国际贸易这一类经济问题，是有不小意义的。这种讨论会有助于国际紧张局势的缓和，当然，也可能结束像对中国实行禁运这种可耻的勾当。当然，在这个会议上是难以维护歧视政策和各种限制与破坏正常国际贸易的政策的。然而，这个会议却有助于那些想进行贸易的大小国家之间贸易的发展。如果有哪一个国家不愿意发展贸易，这是它自己的事。要紧的是：它不应阻挠别国进行贸易。
    有人硬说裁减军备问题是联合国的事，而不是五大国的事，莫洛托夫就这一点说：事实上，研究上述问题不仅是联合国的事，而且也是各大国的事，这些国家如果意识到自己对裁减军备的责任，它们就应该积极和主动地解决这个问题。莫洛托夫引证了一九五二年五月二十八日英国、美国和法国向联合国裁减军备委员会提出的提案，这个提案主张限制苏联、美国、中国以及英国和法国武装部队的数目。莫洛托夫说：因此，我们有理由说，大国裁减军备问题也是和中国有关的，因为上述提案就直接提到了中国。莫洛托夫着重指出：难道我们在五国会议上就不能促成这个问题的解决吗？苏联代表团打算在这次四大国会议上也提出自己关于裁减军备问题的建议。
    莫洛托夫提到杜勒斯对中华人民共和国的攻击，特别是对中国外交部部长周恩来的攻击，他说：可惜中华人民共和国的代表不在这里。我并不怀疑，他们如果在这里，一定会对这些话给以应得的回答。我认为，在中华人民共和国的代表不在场的时候，严厉批评中国是既不大公正，又不大令人信服的。莫洛托夫驳斥了杜勒斯和皮杜尔对中华人民共和国的诬蔑。他说：如果杜勒斯和皮杜尔看看事实，研究一下真实情况，他们就会认识到中国是侵略的受害者，中国国境的安全曾受到真正的威胁。毫无理由诬蔑中华人民共和国是侵略者。这个国家的建立是中国人民的伟大成就。中国人民许多世纪以来第一次团结成为一个统一的国家，他们以这个国家自豪。中华人民共和国知道应该谴责谁，知道谁侮辱了它，因为某些国家对它干出了一些不公正的勾当。但是，中国自己却愿意和所有其他国家保持正常的政治和经济关系，并且在平等的基础上发展这种关系。
    莫洛托夫说：虽然会议还没有充分讨论过提出来的全部问题，但是毕竟已经可以作出某些结论了。我们可以指出，召开五大国会议的建议并没有被任何人拒绝。另一方面，大家又对这个会议的目的表示了各种意见。在这方面，还不能说我们已经获得了协议，因而还需要作进一步的研究。如果能在这个基础上取得某种协议，那末，我认为这就是我们工作的一个进展。
    杜勒斯接着发言，他说：美国不同意召开有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议的原则，但是并不反对和中华人民共和国的代表会晤，来处理应该讨论的问题，如朝鲜问题。但是这种会议不能就是五大国会议。杜勒斯建议暂时停止讨论这个问题而转入议程中其他问题的讨论，这个问题可以到以后再谈。
    皮杜尔说：应当采取一个由一切和某些具体问题有关的国家就亚洲问题进行谈判的原则。至于谈判的性质、参加谈判的成员以及应当讨论的问题，还需要进一步讨论，还需要一些时间进行考虑。
    莫洛托夫指出：一方面，讨论中的问题还没有取得协议；另一方面，又有人希望继续求得协议。他建议立即成立一个委员会，以便帮助取得协议。这样，部长们就可以处理其他问题，而在适当时候听取这个委员会的工作报告。
    艾登再次建议暂时停止讨论第一项议程，转而讨论第二、第三项议程，过些时候再恢复第一项议程的讨论。
    美、法、英三国外长反对成立一个委员会。他们说，他们宁愿由四个外长自己继续讨论关于召开五大国会议的问题。杜勒斯建议在下星期为此举行一次不要顾问参加的秘密会议。至于建立一个委员会的问题，他建议等到在原则上取得协议以后再说。皮杜尔和艾登支持杜勒斯的意见。
    莫洛托夫说：由于目前有人对建立委员会的必要性表示怀疑，苏联代表团要保留在杜勒斯、皮杜尔、艾登所说的会议上提出这个问题的权利。
    外长们对这一点表示同意。
    会议休会以前，莫洛托夫把苏联代表团关于裁减军备问题的提案交给了美、英、法三国外交部部长。提案如下：
    关于召开世界普遍裁减军备会议
    美国、英国、法国和苏联四国政府愿望保障和平及缓和国际紧张局势，认为必须采取适当措施，来减轻各国人民由于扩充军备而承担的沉重的军费负担，因此取得协议：苏联、美国、英国和法国将在联合国组织的范围内采取措施，在一九五四年召开有联合国会员国与非会员国参加的世界普遍裁减军备会议，并且已经完全取得协议，认为关于普遍裁减军备的措施的计划应和同时解决原子武器的问题配合起来。
   【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社柏林二十八日讯：苏联和外国记者二百多人于二十七日出席了在柏林民主区新闻大厦举行的记者招待会。
    苏联外交部新闻司司长勒·弗·伊利切夫简单地报告了四国外长会议第三次会议的情况。他并向记者介绍了西方三国外长关于在前次会议上一致同意的第一项议程的发言。记者们以极大的注意倾听了关于维·米·莫洛托夫就第一项议程的发言内容的详细介绍。
    伊利切夫并在记者招待会上宣布：一月二十七日苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫已把德意志民主共和国政府给四国外长会议的信转交给当天的会议主席、英国外交大臣安·艾登，并希望外长会议能在适当的时候予以讨论。这封信要求四国外长会议讨论德国问题时邀请德意志民主共和国代表和西德代表参加。这封信的副本已分别交给法国外交部长和美国国务卿。
    伊利切夫对外国记者提出的问题作了答复。
   【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社柏林二十九日讯：一月二十八日晚间，苏联外交部新闻司司长勒·弗·伊利切夫在柏林民主区新闻大厦举行的苏联和外国记者招待会上，向记者们介绍了莫洛托夫在四国外长会议上提出的关于召开世界普遍裁减军备会议的建议的内容。他在招待会上用英文、法文和德文宣读了这个引起了记者们极大兴趣的建议。然后，伊利切夫向记者们详细叙述了二十八日会议的情况。
