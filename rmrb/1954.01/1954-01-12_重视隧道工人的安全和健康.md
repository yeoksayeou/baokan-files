Emphasize the Safety and Health of Tunnel Workers
　　Ke Yulin

In October 1953, this newspaper received a letter from readers Wang Qianlei and others reflecting that the ventilation equipment in Tunnel No. 20 of the Fengsha Railway (a new railway line from Fengtai to Shacheng) was poor, seriously affecting the health of the tunnel workers. In order to understand the actual situation, this newspaper sent a reporter to the scene to investigate.

Military workers from a certain railway engineering unit are driving a four-li-long pilot tunnel horizontally through the root of a particularly hard rocky mountain. The east and west entrances of this tunnel have now been excavated for more than 1,100 meters, and the pilot tunnel has not yet been connected. I personally saw the workers operating the pneumatic drills using their chests to try to control the violent vibrations of the drills, their entire bodies covered with stone powder spewing from the drill holes, even their eyes unable to look freely. The handcar workers responsible for hauling the slag had to laboriously transport thousands of tons of stone slag from the narrow pilot tunnel. This is an arduous task. When I walked along this narrow tunnel, I felt a little difficulty breathing after being in there for a while. And our worker comrades are working tenaciously and intensively under such difficult conditions. In June 1953, when the ventilation was poor, the smoke from blasting in the tunnel could not dissipate quickly, and not enough fresh air could be input. Many drillers were once overcome by the smoke; even handcar workers and workers who entered the tunnel to rescue others fainted in the pilot tunnel. At that time, many soldiers with a high degree of patriotism did not fear or shrink back at all. On the one hand, they made suggestions to the leadership for improving the ventilation equipment, and on the other hand, they worked even more stubbornly. When they had been working in the tunnel for too long and were suffocating with sweat and rapid breathing, they thought of the great trust the motherland had placed in them, and the heroic actions of the志愿军 (Volunteer Army), which encouraged them to continue to persevere in their work. Soldier Zhao Huaishan had already fainted in the tunnel several times, and the instructor almost used a stern tone to persuade him to rest. He said, "I still have one cart of slag that I haven't pushed out!" and ran back into the tunnel without turning his head.

How lovely and admirable the soldiers are! They made contributions to the people in the war, and now they are dedicating all their strength to national construction. Cherishing them, caring for them, and using the greatest strength to solve their safe production problems in order to accelerate the progress of the project are issues that relevant leading authorities should pay attention to at all times.

Although the east entrance of Tunnel No. 20 had long been equipped with two generators and three blowers, which could maintain ventilation within 1,000 meters, because the machinery leasing department did not explain the performance and operating capabilities of the machines to the mechanical workers, the mechanical workers did not dare to boldly start the machines, so that on the one hand, the equipment capacity was not fully utilized, and on the other hand, the on-site workers suffered from insufficient ventilation. Later, the situation became more serious. The Fourth Engineering Bureau's leasing station did not send an engineer to inspect the machines until early November 1953, extending the operating time of the machines and preventing air leaks in the ventilation pipes. As a result, the phenomenon of smoke suffocation gradually decreased. This fact reflects that the leaders of the Fourth Engineering Bureau lacked due concern for the safety and health of the workers. They only pursued the progress of the tunnel, but did not pay attention to solving the ventilation problem. They also did not check or supervise the work of the leasing station. This is the important reason why the safety problem of this tunnel has existed for a long time. Of course, the Fourth Engineering Bureau was established not long ago and lacked experience, which also had its objective difficulties; but as long as the leadership truly pays attention, this problem can be solved as soon as possible.

At present, although the amount of ventilation in the tunnel can barely be maintained, the tunnel will be dug deeper and deeper in the future, and the working conditions of the soldiers will become more and more difficult (the east entrance will soon exceed 1,000 meters), and the existing ventilation equipment will not be sufficient. Therefore, the leaders of the Fourth Engineering Bureau should learn from past lessons, in addition to quickly finding ways to increase ventilation equipment and preparing to apply for the purchase of long-distance high-pressure blowers as soon as possible, they should also pay attention to the health of the workers as much as possible from all aspects. This is the demand of the workers, and it is also for the long-term interests of the country.

    重视隧道工人的安全和健康
    柯月霖
    一九五三年十月，本报接到读者王钱垒等来信反映：丰沙线（丰台到沙城的一条铁路新线）第二十号隧道通风设备不良，严重地影响了隧道工人的健康。为了了解实际情况，本报曾派记者亲到现场作了调查。
    铁路工程某部的军工们正在一座特坚石质的山根上，横穿一条四里多长的导洞，现在这条隧道东西两口已经开挖了一千一百多公尺，导洞还没有打通。我亲眼看到掌握风钻的工人们用他们的胸脯尽力制压着风钻的剧烈震动，浑身上下罩满了从钻眼里喷射出来的石粉，甚至连眼睛都不能自由地张望。担负出碴任务的手车工们要把成千上万吨的石碴从狭长的导洞内艰辛地运送出来。这是一件艰巨的工作。当我沿着这狭长的隧道进去，待久了就觉得呼吸有些困难。而我们的工人同志，就在这样艰苦的条件下坚韧地、紧张地工作着。一九五三年六月间，在通风不良的情况下，隧道内放炮的硝烟不能很快的消散，新鲜的空气不能足量的输入，曾经发生好多钻工被烟薰倒的事情；甚至连手车工和进洞救护别人的工人也晕倒在导洞内。当时，许多具有高度爱国主义精神的战士们丝毫没有畏惧和退缩，他们一面向领导方面提出改善通风设备的建议，一面更加顽强地工作着。当他们在隧道里工作过久，窒息得汗流浃背、呼吸紧促的时候，他们就想起祖国对他们的重大付托，想到志愿军的英雄行为，从而鼓舞了自己继续坚持工作。战士赵怀山已经在洞内晕倒了几次，指导员几乎是用严厉的口吻劝他休息。他说了一句“我还有一车石碴没有推出来！”就头也不回地跑进洞去了。
    战士们是多么可爱，又多么可敬啊！他们在战争中为人民立下了功勋，现在又为国家建设献出自己的全部力量。珍视他们，爱护他们，用最大力量解决他们的安全生产问题，以加速工程的进展，这是有关领导机关应该时刻注意的问题。
    第二十号隧道的东口虽然早就备有两部发电机和三部送风机，可以维持一千公尺内的通风，但是，由于机器经租部门没有向机械工人交代机器的性能和运转能力，机械工人不敢大胆开动机器，以致一方面设备能力没有充分发挥，另一方面现场工人受到通风不足的危害。后来事态发展得更严重了，第四工程局经租站才在一九五三年十一月初派来工程师检定机器，延长了机器的开动时间，防止了通风管漏气的现象。于是，炮烟薰人的现象逐渐减少。这一事实反映了第四工程局领导方面对工人的安全和健康问题还缺乏应有的关心。他们只是追求隧道的进度，却不重视解决通风问题。对经租站的工作也不加检查、督促。这就是这个隧道的安全问题长期存在的重要原因。当然，第四工程局成立不久，经验不足，也有其客观困难；但是只要领导上真正重视，这个问题是可以及早解决的。
    目前，隧道内的通风量虽然可以勉强维持，但是今后隧道的掘进日深，战士们的工作条件也愈益艰苦（东口很快就要超过一千公尺），现有的通风设备就会不敷需要，因此，第四工程局的领导方面应该吸取过去的教训，除了迅速设法增加通风设备，及早准备申请订购长距离高压送风机外，并应尽可能地从各方面注意工人群众的健康问题，这是工人群众的要求，也是为了国家的长远利益。
