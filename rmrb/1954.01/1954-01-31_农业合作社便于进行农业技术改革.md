　　Agricultural Cooperatives Facilitate Agricultural Technology Reform
　　No More Concerns About Trying New Technologies

　　Last year, the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, learned from the advanced experience of Chen Yongkang, a national model for high rice yield. They prepared standardized seedbeds, used salt water to select all rice seeds, and sowed seeds using the "Luogu Xi" method, cultivating strong seedlings. These seedlings had thick stems and strong leaves, and they survived transplantation without yellowing. Later, the rice plants also grew very thick. The cooperative also used the "small-row square dense planting" method, increasing the number of rice plants per mu by several times compared to previous years. This agricultural production cooperative was only established last year. Before that, many members had concerns about learning advanced technologies in mutual aid teams, especially when farming individually. They were afraid that using new technologies would damage the rice plants and affect the harvest. Therefore, they dared not try new technologies in the past, or only tried them on a very small plot of land. In 1953, land was pooled as shares, and unified management and unified profit distribution were implemented. At this time, some active members of the cooperative, who had increased production by using new technologies in the past, actively advocated for the use of new technologies, and others agreed. They said: Whether the rice harvest is large or small, everyone gets the same share of the profits. Others have experimented with new methods and advocate for using new technologies, so they definitely won't let us suffer! The results of production last year proved that the adoption of new technologies made the rice grow particularly well, and the yield was also high, further dispelling farmers' concerns. Member Zhou Jinsheng, who had previously been afraid to adopt new technologies, now says: "I have never seen such good rice before; the rice of any mutual aid team or individual farmer in the village cannot compare with that of our cooperative."

　　Tractors Solve the Difficulty of Autumn Plowing

　　The Luciazhuang, Zhangtou, and Nantian Gong agricultural production cooperatives in Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, all had a lot of autumn land but few livestock. Last year, they also encountered drought during the autumn plowing season. Livestock struggled to pull old plows, and the plowing was slow. They had no confidence in completing the autumn plowing plan. In particular, Nantian Gong Cooperative had 423 mu of autumn land, but only three teams of livestock. It was estimated that only half of the land could be plowed before the ground froze. After learning about this situation, the Changzhi County Agricultural Machinery Station dispatched tractors to help them plow the land, solving these difficulties. All three cooperatives completed their autumn plowing plans before the beginning of winter and transitioned to winter production. Tractor plowing also promoted the consolidation and development of these three cooperatives. For example, during the rectification of Luciazhuang Cooperative, four households, including Lu Suoze, saw that the cooperative had few livestock and feared that production would not go well, so they wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. After the tractor plowing, they firmly decided not to withdraw and said: "The tractor plows really well, ten mules cannot compare to it. With tractors plowing our land, production will definitely go well." The enthusiasm of cooperative director Gao Chou'er also increased, and he planned to expand the cooperative to more than a hundred households in one or two years. Some members also felt that their small plots of land could not be used by tractors, so they voluntarily exchanged five plots of land, totaling 21 mu, with non-members. Members of Nantian Gong Cooperative also voluntarily exchanged land and canceled the boundaries, preparing for tractor plowing. Zhangtou Cooperative, because various crops were planted on one plot of land, making it difficult to plow, prepared to plant one type of crop on one plot to facilitate tractor plowing.

　　Impossible in Mutual Aid, Now Possible

　　Although the land of the He Chengshun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lucun Township, Suburban County, Henan Province, is barren, the harvest is 15 to 33 percent higher than that of general mutual aid teams and 45 percent higher than that of individual farmers. In order to learn advanced technologies and improve production, after the autumn of 1952, the cooperative used different soil qualities to experiment with seven methods of densely planting wheat that they had learned from the county farm and other cooperatives, including the double-row seeder, Jiaodong wo wheat, longitudinal and transverse sowing, inserting the seeder and ridging, and leaning the seeder and ridging. During the experiment, they conducted further research. For example, Jiaodong wo wheat, because of its many seeds and dense roots, would reduce production if the wheat stalks fell over. They chose to sow it in irrigated land and applied fertilizer with more potassium to strengthen the wheat stalks after planting. Because the sowing width and amount of wo wheat were large, fearing that it would "grow too vigorously," they sowed it ten days later than general wheat. As a result, the wheat sown using these advanced technologies yielded more than 500 jin per mu last year. They also studied the relationship between soil properties and crop growth, implementing the practice of planting what is suitable for the soil and fully utilizing the land's fertility. For example, more than 20 mu of west-facing slope land, with loose soil and good sunlight, was suitable for planting cotton, so all of it was planted with cotton, yielding 150 jin of seed cotton per mu, equivalent to 500 jin of grain. In the past, when the land was scattered among households, no one could plant all cotton, and planting beans and grain could only yield more than 200 jin per mu, half less than the income from planting cotton. Many things they had thought about but could not do in the mutual aid teams have now been accomplished in the cooperative.

　　"Land's Potential Has Digging Power"

　　The fields of the Yin Manxian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lianhua Village, Guangyuan County, Sichuan Province, are all dry land. Before the establishment of the cooperative, they were threatened by drought every year. Two mu and one fen of dry land could not be transplanted on time every year due to lack of water sources. In the spring of 1953, the agricultural production cooperative was established. After unifying the use of land, the cooperative carried out land processing, adopted the double-plow cultivation method, changed shallow plowing to deep plowing, preliminarily improved the soil, and brought out the potential of the land. At the same time, water conservancy projects were built: water dams were blocked, and water gates and drainage ditches were built, ensuring that the cooperative's more than 90 mu of dry land was free from the threat of drought, and more than 5 mu of dry land were turned into paddy fields, greatly bringing out the role of collective production. The cooperative's total grain production increased by 14,478 jin, an increase of 35 percent compared to the previous year. Among them, grain crops averaged 442 jin per mu, an increase of 46 percent compared to the previous year, exceeding the output of the best Huang Chenggui mutual aid team in the area by 11 percent and exceeding the output of individual farmers with higher yields by 40 percent.

　　The fact that dry land can grow millet with a high proportion of increased production has educated the members of the cooperative and the masses, making their thinking of "production reaching the top" gradually eliminated. "Cooperatives greatly increase production, and the land's potential has digging power" has become everyone's common conclusion.

　　Expanded Irrigation Area, Facilitated Crop Rotation

　　The land of the Xia Sanba Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongchang County, Gansu Province, must be irrigated with concentrated ditch water in rotation and undergo crop rotation every year in order to have a better harvest. Before the establishment of the cooperative, farmers irrigated their own land, and the water was not enough. After the establishment of the cooperative in 1953, land was pooled as shares, boundaries were broken, and unified cultivation was implemented, saving water and expanding the irrigation area by 9.98 percent. Crop rotation was also very convenient, and there was sufficient strength to improve cultivation techniques. The local custom was to mix barley, peas, and broad beans, but the maturity periods of peas and broad beans varied, affecting each other and resulting in poor harvests. In 1953, they mixed barley and peas and planted broad beans separately. As a result, the average yield per mu was 187 jin, exceeding the general yield in the area by 199.5 percent. The cooperative also intercropped peas in 25 mu of flax land. In addition to the flax growing very well, they also harvested 1,800 jin of peas. Due to the use of soft-harness foot plows to turn the land, it only took one day to permeate after irrigation, which was faster than with old plows. These were all conditions that contributed to the cooperative's bumper harvest.

　　Learning from Zhaoyuan's Experience, Doubling Production

　　Gao Qinglian, the director of the Xin Jian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Western Liaoning Province, learned about Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience last year. She then told the members of the cooperative about the increased grain production from implementing new cultivation methods in Zhaoyuan and discussed with the members whether to learn from this experience in their own cooperative. At that time, the members did not believe it. Tang Wancai said: "Look, our director is still 'bragging' for Zhaoyuan. Whose land can produce so much grain?" In light of this situation, Gao Qinglian introduced the fact that the agricultural cooperative had produced 8,000 jin of grain per hectare last year due to dense planting and attention to technology. Because everyone knew about this cooperative, and Gao Qinglian explained the reasons for their increased production, the members' thinking changed. After listening to the director's words, last year they implemented Zhaoyuan's new cultivation methods in accordance with local conditions, based on mountain land, flat land, and good or bad soil quality. During spring plowing, the cooperative timely overcame the spring drought and achieved timely sowing. After the seedlings emerged, they also spaced the seedlings in the sorghum field evenly, based on soil quality and past habits, and left "double rows plus one plant" of seedlings in five mu of millet land. After the seedlings were thinned, the cooperative quickly applied topdressing. The entire cooperative's labor force carried out unified cultivation, and all work was done in a timely and meticulous manner. As a result, the cooperative's autumn crops, because of the promotion of Zhaoyuan's experience, produced a total of 340 shi of grain, more than double that of 1952, and picked 24,000 jin of cotton, 9,000 jin more than in 1952.

### 农业合作社便于进行农业技术改革

　　农业合作社便于进行农业技术改革
    对试用新技术没有顾虑了
    江苏吴县新民农业生产合作社去年学习了全国水稻丰产模范陈永康的先进经验，做了合式秧田，把全部稻种用盐水选过，用“落谷稀”的办法下种，培植了壮秧，使秧苗干粗叶壮，栽到田里不见落黄便活了棵，后来稻棵也发得很粗。全社还运用了“小株方形密植”法，每亩田的稻棵比往年增加了好几成。这个农业生产合作社是去年才成立的，在这以前，不少社员在互助组时，尤其在单干时，对学习先进技术有许多顾虑。他们怕用新技术把稻棵弄坏，影响收成。因此，往年不敢试用新技术，或者只在很小的一块地上试用。一九五三年土地入了股，实行统一经营，收成统一分红。这时，社里有些积极分子，因为往年用新技术增了产，他们积极主张用新技术，其他人也就赞成了。他们说：稻子收多收少，人家和自己一样分红，人家试验过新办法，主张用新技术，绝对不会叫自己吃亏呀！去年一年生产的结果，证明了采用新技术使稻子长得特别好，产量也高。更打消了农民的顾虑。社员周金生，过去就是不敢采用新技术的，现在也说：“这样好的稻子，我从来没有看到过；乡里随便那个互助组、单干户的稻子都比不上我们合作社的好。”
      拖拉机解决了秋耕困难
    山西长治县鹿家庄、嶂头、南天贡等三个农业生产合作社，都是秋地多、牲口少，去年秋耕时又逢天旱，牲口拉旧犁很吃力，犁得也慢，都没有信心完成秋耕计划；特别是南天贡社有四百二十三亩秋地，但只有三犋牲口，估计在地上冻前只能耕一半。长治县农业机器站了解了这种情况后，出动了拖拉机帮他们代耕，使这些困难都解决了，三个社都于立冬前全部完成秋耕计划，转入了冬季生产。拖拉机耕地还促进了这三个社的巩固发展。如鹿家庄社在进行整顿时，鹿锁则等四户看到社里牲口少，怕生产搞不好，想出社；经过拖拉机耕地后，他们便坚决不出社了，并说：“拖拉机耕得真好，十头骡子也顶不了，有拖拉机给咱代耕土地，生产一定能搞好。”社长高臭儿的劲头也更大了，他计划在一、二年里把社扩大到百余户。还有些社员感到他们的小块地不能使用拖拉机，便和非社员自愿调换了五块土地，共二十一亩。南天贡社社员也自愿调换土地，并取消了地界，准备用拖拉机耕地。嶂头社因多种作物种在一块地不好耕，准备把一种作物都种在一块，以利拖拉机耕作。
      互助时办不到，现在办到了
    河南省郊县卢村乡贺成顺农业生产合作社的土地虽然瘠薄，收成却比一般互助组高出百分之十五到三十三，比个体农民高出百分之四十五。为了学好先进技术，提高生产，该社一九五二年秋后曾利用不同的土质，分别实验了他们从县农场和其他社所学得的套耧、胶东窝麦、纵横交播、插耧并垅、靠耧并垅等七种密植小麦的方法。在进行实验的时候，他们作了进一步的研究，例如胶东窝麦因籽多根密，麦秆一卧倒就要减产，他们便选择水地播种，种后施含钾质较多的肥料以壮麦秆，窝麦播幅宽、量大，怕“旺过”，种时就比一般小麦迟播十来天。结果，他们运用这些先进技术播种的小麦，去年每亩获得了五百多斤的收成。他们还研究了土壤性能与作物生长关系，实行收啥种啥，充分发挥地力。例如二十多亩西坡地，土质松、迎阳光，适宜种棉花，就都种了棉花，每亩收籽棉一百五十斤，折合谷子五百斤；但过去土地分散在各户，谁也不能全种棉花，种上豆类和谷子，每亩只能收二百多斤，比种棉花的收入少了一半。许多他们在互助组时曾经想过而没有办到的事，现在转入合作社却都办到了。
    “土地潜在力有挖头”
    四川省广元县莲花村尹满先农业生产合作社的田地全是旱地，未建社前，历年都遭受旱灾威胁，有两亩一分旱田因无水源，每年都不能按时插秧。一九五三年春天成立了农业生产合作社，统一使用土地后，社内进行了土地加工，又采用了套犁耕作法，变浅耕为深耕，初步改良土壤，发挥了土地潜力；同时兴修了水利：堵水凼，又修水闸、开排水沟，保证全社九十多亩旱地免除了旱灾威胁，而且把五亩多的旱地变成了水田，大大发挥了集体生产的作用。全社共增产粮食一万四千四百七十八斤，比前年增产百分之三十五，其中粮食作物每亩平均产到四百四十二斤，比前年增产百分之四十六，超过当地最好的黄成贵互助组产量百分之十一，超过产量较高的单干农民的产量百分之四十。
    旱地长谷子，增产比例高的事实，教育了社员，也教育了群众，使他们“生产到顶”的思想逐渐消除，“合作社增产大，土地潜在力有挖头”，已成为大家共同的结论。
    扩大了浇地面积，便利了倒槎
    甘肃省永昌县下三坝农业生产合作社的土地，每年必须集中沟水轮灌，进行倒槎轮作，才能有较好的收成。成立社以前，农民各浇各的地，水就不够用。一九五三年该社成立后，土地入股，打破地界，统一耕种，节省了用水，使浇地面积扩大了百分之九点九八，倒槎也很方便，而且有充分的力量改进耕作技术。当地习惯把青稞、豌豆、扁豆混种，但豌豆和扁豆成熟期迟早不一，互相影响，收成不好。一九五三年他们把青稞、豌豆混种，扁豆另种，结果每亩平均产量为一百八十七斤，超过当地一般产量百分之一百九十九点五。该社又在二十五亩胡麻地中混种豌豆，除胡麻长得很好外，还收了豌豆一千八百斤。由于利用软套步犁翻地，浇灌后只需一天就能渗透，比旧犁翻地渗透得快。这些，都是造成该社丰收的条件。
    学习肇源经验，增产一倍
    辽西省新建农业生产合作社社长高清莲，去年学习了肇源丰产经验以后，就在社里对社员讲肇源实行新耕作法多打粮食的事情，并和社员商量，在自己的社里也学习这个经验。当时社员一听都不相信，汤万才说：“你看，咱们主任还替肇源‘吹牛’呢，谁的地能打那么多粮食？”根据这种情况，高清莲就介绍了利用农业合作社去年因为密植，讲求技术，一垧地打了八千斤粮食的事实。因为这个社大家都知道，高清莲又说出了他们增产多的原因，所以社员的思想才改变了。他们听了社长的话，去年就根据山地、平地、土质好坏，因地制宜地实行了肇源的新耕作法。在春耕时，该社及时地战胜了春旱，做到了适时播种。在禾苗出来后，他们又根据土质和历年习惯，在高粱地里间直苗，距离力求均匀，并把五亩谷地留了“双行加一株”的苗。在间苗完后，社里就抓紧上追肥。全社劳力统一进行耕作，一切工作都作得及时又细致。结果全社秋庄稼因为推行了肇源经验，共打了三百四十石粮食，比一九五二年增加一倍还多，棉花拣了二万四千斤，比一九五二年多拣了九千斤。
