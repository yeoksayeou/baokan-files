    Suzhou Grain Company Outlet Corrects the Practice of Randomly Issuing Pick-Up Vouchers

    Letter from Suzhou Grain Company: The "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on November 8th published Lu Dezhang's criticism of our company's outlet for repeatedly issuing pick-up vouchers randomly. This phenomenon occurred more frequently before September, mainly due to a lack of communication between the outlet and the processing section, as well as the carelessness of our staff. (The system mentioned in the letter, where the processing section reports daily inventory statements to the business section, was established later.) Since rectifying labor discipline and improving systems, this phenomenon has decreased, and it has not occurred in the past two months. In the future, we will continue to improve our systems and strengthen cadre education to further improve our work.

    苏州市粮食公司门市部已纠正乱开提货凭证的做法
    苏州市粮食公司来信：十一月八日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了鲁德章批评我公司门市部屡次乱开提货凭证的现象，在九月以前比较多，主要是门市部与加工科缺乏联系和工作人员粗枝大叶所造成（信中所谈加工科每天有库存报表报业务科的这个制度，是以后才建立的）。自整顿劳动纪律和健全制度以后，这种现象已经减少，近两个月来就没有出现过。今后我们还要不断健全制度和加强干部教育，进一步改进工作。
