Xinhua News Agency Report: The large-scale expansion project of Daye Steel Plant, under the state-owned Central China Iron and Steel Corporation, is scheduled to commence this spring. Preparations for the construction have been underway for a year. The preliminary design for the first phase, first step of the project was completed in August last year. Currently, technical design data is being further collected, and a general construction layout plan is being developed. Orders for the more than 1,900 pieces of equipment required for the expansion have been placed or are being placed both domestically and internationally. Various temporary construction projects needed for the construction are also about to begin.

The expansion of Daye Steel Plant is the prelude to the comprehensive construction of the Central China Iron and Steel Corporation, the second steel base to be built after Anshan Iron and Steel Company in China's First Five-Year Economic Construction Plan. After the expansion, Daye Steel Plant will become a steel plant with complete equipment, high degree of mechanization and automation, capable of producing a variety of high-grade, high-quality steel, and its production capacity will greatly exceed the current production level.

The expansion project of Daye Steel Plant will be carried out in two phases, with the first phase divided into two steps. The first step of the expansion project, commencing this year and to be completed in 1955, will involve the construction of new open-hearth steelmaking furnaces, electric furnaces, and rolling mills and forging workshops that are much larger than the existing ones, as well as the installation of large steam hammers, hydraulic presses, and gas, steam, water, and electricity equipment. In order to adapt to this large-scale and technically complex expansion project, the Central China Iron and Steel Corporation is gathering a large number of technicians, management cadres, and basic construction workers, preparing to establish six engineering companies, including steelmaking, rolling, electromechanical installation, metal structure, pipeline road construction, and civil construction, as well as six affiliated factories, including a mechanized supply station, a wood processing factory, a cement mixing plant, and a mechanized brick and tile factory. Since April 1952, the Central China Iron and Steel Corporation has transferred specialized technical personnel in smelting, electrical engineering, machinery, geology, and metallurgy, as well as well-trained Communist Party members from various places to Anshan, Taiyuan, and other places for study. They will become the backbone force in the expansion project of Daye Steel Plant.

Daye Steel Plant is located in the richly mineralized Daye Iron Mining Area, close to the south bank of the Yangtze River. Its predecessor was part of the long-bankrupt Hanyeping Company and had long been unable to produce before liberation. After the People's Government took over, after several years of restoration and reform, production has greatly developed. At the same time, with the help of Soviet experts, the plant has successfully trial-produced dozens of types of high-quality steel, supplying the needs of national construction, and has trained a large number of technical personnel.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 14th: The iron ore reserves in the Daye Mining Area are abundant. According to existing data, they are sufficient for the preliminary design of a new giant steel plant for China’s other steel base – the Central China Iron and Steel Corporation. The geological exploration reports of the various iron mines in the Daye Mining Area have been preliminarily compiled.

The actual ore volume of the iron mines in the Daye Mining Area, after several years, especially the large-scale exploration in 1953, has proven to far exceed the historical estimates. Some mines have even exceeded the figures expected by the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government. For example, the ore volume in the Tieshan area exceeds the national expected figure by more than 40%; the ore volume in the outlying Lingxiang Iron Mine exceeds it by more than 12%. The Echeng Iron Mine, which had been frantically plundered by the Japanese invaders and considered to have no significant economic value, has been proven by exploration to still have considerable economic value, and it has also reached the national expected ore volume figure. In addition, geological exploration personnel have successively discovered new iron ore deposits in several areas such as Jianlin Mountain and Jinshan Store. These newly discovered iron ore deposits are all distributed between the known iron mines in the Daye Mining Area, connecting the entire mining area into a continuous area.

Exploration has proven that the iron mines in the Daye Mining Area are not only rich in reserves, but also have good ore quality and very convenient mining conditions. The ore of each iron mine has a high iron content and few impurities harmful to ironmaking, mainly high-quality magnetite or hematite. All of the ore in the Echeng Iron Mine, the vast majority of the ore in the Lingxiang Iron Mine, and part of the ore in the Tieshan area can be mined in the open air, without the need for ventilation, drainage equipment, and tunnel excavation projects. Therefore, mining costs will be greatly reduced.

Currently, the geological exploration personnel are accelerating the nearly completed iron ore exploration work and conducting exploration or general surveys of other resources in the mining area.

### 我国建设第二个钢铁基地的先声  大冶钢厂扩建工程将在今春动工  大冶矿区铁矿储量丰富、质量好、开采便利

    我国建设第二个钢铁基地的先声
    大冶钢厂扩建工程将在今春动工
    大冶矿区铁矿储量丰富、质量好、开采便利
    【新华社讯】国营华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂的大规模扩建工程，将要在今年春季动工。施工的准备工作已经进行了一年。第一期第一步工程的初步设计已在去年八月完成，现正在进一步搜集技术设计资料，进行施工总布置计划。扩建所需的一千九百多项设备，已经或正在向国内外订货。施工需要的各项暂设工程也即将动工。
    大冶钢厂的扩建，是我国第一个五年经济建设计划中，继鞍山钢铁公司之后将要开始建设的第二个钢铁基地——华中钢铁公司全面建设的先声。扩建以后的大冶钢厂，将成为一个设备完善，高度机械化、自动化，能生产多品种高级优质钢的钢厂，生产能力将大大超过现在的生产水平。
    大冶钢厂的扩建工程将分两期进行，第一期又分两步。今年开工，一九五五年完成的第一步扩建工程，将要新建比现在大得多的炼钢平炉、电炉和轧钢车间、锻压车间，安装大型汽锤、水压机和煤气、蒸气、水电等设备。为了适应这个规模巨大、技术复杂的扩建工程，华中钢铁公司正在集结大批的技术人员、管理干部和基本建设工人，准备建立炼钢、轧钢、机电安装、金属结构、管道筑路和土木建筑等六个工程公司，以及机械化供应站和木材加工厂、水泥搅拌厂、机制砖瓦厂等六个附属工厂。从一九五二年四月起，华中钢铁公司就从各地调集了许多冶炼、电机、机械、地质、矿冶等方面的专门技术人材和久经锻炼的共产党员，送往鞍山、太原等地学习。他们将成为大冶钢厂扩建工程中的骨干力量。
    大冶钢厂位于我国矿藏丰富的大冶铁矿区，紧挨着长江南岸。它的前身是早已破产的汉冶萍公司的一部分，解放前早就不能生产了。人民政府接管后，经过几年的恢复和改革，生产有了很大发展。同时在苏联专家帮助下，该厂已试制成功好几十种优质钢，供应国家建设需要，并培养了大批技术人才。
    【新华社武汉十四日电】大冶矿区的铁矿储量丰富，根据已有资料，已足可供给我国另一个钢铁基地——华中钢铁公司新建巨型钢铁厂的初步设计之用。现大冶矿区各铁矿的地质勘探报告已初步编制出来。
    大冶矿区各铁矿的实际矿量，经过几年来特别是一九五三年的大规模勘探，证明都远超过历史上所作的估计，有些矿并且超过了中央人民政府地质部预期的数字。如铁山本区的矿量超过国家预期数字百分之四十多；外围灵乡铁矿的矿量超过百分之十二以上；曾遭受过日本侵略者的疯狂掠夺，认为没有重大经济价值的鄂城铁矿，勘探证明，它的经济价值仍然相当大，并且也达到了国家预期的矿量数字。此外，地质勘探人员并先后在尖林山、金山店等几个地区发现了新的铁矿床。这些新发现的铁矿，都分布在大冶矿区已知的铁矿之间，使整个矿区断续地连成了一片。
    勘探证明，大冶矿区的铁矿不仅储量丰富，而且矿质也好，开采条件十分便利。各铁矿的矿石含铁量高，对炼铁有害的杂质少，主要是优质的磁铁矿或赤铁矿。鄂城铁矿的全部、灵乡铁矿的绝大部分和铁山本区的部分矿石，都可以露天开采，不需要通风、排水设备和开凿巷道工程。因此，开采成本将大大降低。
    现在，地质勘探人员们正在加速进行接近完成的铁矿勘探工作，并对矿区的其他资源进行勘探或普查工作。
