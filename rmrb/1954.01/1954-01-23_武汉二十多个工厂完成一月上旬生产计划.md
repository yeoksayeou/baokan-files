Over twenty major state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Wuhan have reversed the usual practice of being lax at the beginning of the month and rushing at the end. They have achieved excellent results in fulfilling the state plan for the first ten days of January. According to statistics, the following factories exceeded their production plans for the first ten days of January: State-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Wuhan Power Machinery Factory, Hankou Auto Parts Factory; Locally state-owned Wuhan Chemical Factory, Wufeng Flour Mill, Wuhan Oil Factory, Wuhan Food Factory, Wuhan Printing Factory, Wuhan Match Factory, Universe Tobacco Factory; Joint state-private Zhenhuan Yarn Factory, Shenxin Yarn Factory, Nanyang Tobacco Factory, Donghua Dyeing Factory, Jianhua Paint Factory, and others. Many other factories also came close to completing their planned targets for the first ten days of January. For example, the Wuhan No. 1 Textile Company completed 99.45% of its ten-day cotton yarn plan, and 98.04% of its cotton cloth plan. The product quality of most factories that completed their ten-day plans was also very good. The quality of various auto parts manufactured by the Hankou Auto Parts Factory exceeded the planned requirements. The quality of cotton yarn produced by the Wuhan No. 1 Textile Company all reached Grade A.

The important reason for these factories' good plan fulfillment is that they prepared for production in the first quarter of this year, especially in the first month, at the end of last year. All mechanical factories in the city issued the January work plan to the workshops before the end of last year, made material and spare parts reserves, and adjusted labor organization and improved machinery and equipment. The Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has historically been unable to deliver cars at the beginning of the year, but because of the good preparatory work in December last year, it delivered two passenger cars, four freight cars, and one locomotive according to plan in the first ten days of January. The leadership, inspection, and supervision of the production preparation work and production by the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also played a decisive role in the completion of the production plan by the factories.

    武汉二十多个工厂完成一月上旬生产计划
    武汉市二十多个主要的国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂，扭转了月初松、月末紧的惯例，一月上旬完成国家计划的情况很好。据统计，上述工厂中超额完成一月上旬生产计划的有国营武汉第一棉纺织厂、江岸机车车辆修理工厂、武汉动力机厂、汉口汽车配件厂；地方国营武汉化工厂、五丰面粉厂、武汉油厂、武汉食品厂、武汉印刷厂、武汉火柴厂、宇宙烟厂；公私合营震寰纱厂、申新纱厂、南洋烟厂、东华染厂、建华油漆厂等单位。其他不少工厂也接近完成一月上旬预订的计划。如武汉第一纺织公司，棉纱完成旬计划的百分之九十九点四五，棉布也完成了百分之九十八点零四。大部分完成上旬计划的工厂，产品质量也很好。汉口汽车配件厂所制造的各种汽车配件，质量都超过计划要求。武汉第一纺织公司出产的棉纱，质量都达到甲等。
    这些工厂完成计划良好的重要原因，是它们在去年年底便作好了今年第一季度特别是第一个月的生产准备工作。全市机械工厂在去年年底以前就把今年一月份的作业计划下达到了车间，作了材料、备品储备，以及调整劳动组织、改进机器设备等工作。江岸机车车辆修理工厂历来是年初不能出车的，但由于去年十二月份准备工作做得好，一月上旬已按计划交出二辆客车、四辆货车和一台机车。中国共产党武汉市委员会对各厂生产准备工作和生产的领导、检查和督促，对各厂完成生产计划也起了决定的作用。（新华社）
