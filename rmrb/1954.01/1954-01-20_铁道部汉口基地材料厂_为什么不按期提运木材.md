    Railway Ministry Hankou Base Materials Plant
    Why Doesn't It Pick Up Timber on Schedule?
    Letter from Qian Suguang, Lishui Timber Yard of Zhejiang Forest Industry Bureau: According to the sleeper supply contract signed between the Central Railway Ministry's Hankou Base Materials Plant and the Zhejiang Forest Industry Bureau, 5,000 sleepers should be allocated by our yard, with the delivery date being the end of June 1953. However, the plant has not picked up the goods. We have repeatedly sent letters urging them to do so, but the plant has delayed the matter on the pretext of high transportation costs. This situation prevents the normal turnover of a large amount of funds in our yard; and it also causes a lot of timber to be placed outdoors for too long, making it easy to rot and deteriorate, causing damage to state property. It is suggested that units with similar situations attach importance to fulfilling contracts and pick up goods on schedule and in a timely manner.

    铁道部汉口基地材料厂
    为什么不按期提运木材
    浙江森林工业局丽水贮木场钱肃光来信：中央铁道部汉口基地材料厂与浙江森林工业局所订枕木供应合同，其中有五千根枕木应在我场拨交，提货日期为一九五三年六月底。但该厂一直不把货物提去。我们一再去函催促，该厂竟借口运费较大而拖延时日。这种情况，使我场大量资金不能正常周转；并且使不少木材置放露天过久而容易腐朽变质，造成国家财产的损失。建议有类似情况的单位重视履行合同，按期及时提货。
