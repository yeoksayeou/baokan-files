The supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the Southwest Region, in coordination with the work of purchasing grain and industrial raw materials such as cotton, vigorously supply farmers with means of production and means of livelihood. The annual retail plan of the region's supply and marketing cooperatives was completed at approximately 110% in 1953, with total retail sales about 220% of that in 1952.

Since last autumn, cooperatives in various parts of the Southwest have successively expanded their retail networks. By the end of 1953, the region's retail networks had grown to more than 11,300. Many regions have adopted the method of "buying where you go, supplying where you go," organizing peddlers and supply teams to cooperate with grain purchases and go deep into rural areas to supply farmers with needed materials.

In organizing the supply of goods, the cooperatives in various parts of the Southwest, in addition to further strengthening their ties with state-owned commerce, have also vigorously organized local sources of goods. In many regions of Changshou, Peng County, and Dazhu Counties in Sichuan Province, the cooperatives held symposiums with handicraft households, using methods such as issuing raw materials or prepaying partial deposits, and signed ordering contracts with handicraft workers to organize the production of handicrafts needed by farmers. In December of last year, the CCP Mianyang County Committee in Sichuan Province convened a representative meeting of handicraft households in the county to publicize the general line of the country during the transition period to the handicraft households. At the meeting, the Mianyang County Cooperative Federation signed processing contracts with handicraft workers for more than 9,000 pieces of large and small farm tools such as plows, rain capes, drying mats, carrying poles, and manure buckets. In November of last year, the Xindu County Cooperative Federation in Sichuan Province convened a meeting of grassroots cooperatives, making a resolution to organize local sources of goods to ensure supply during the Spring Festival and spring plowing seasons. Last December, the Jianyang County Cooperative in Sichuan Province organized the processing of more than 6,000 bolts of various fabrics, more than 4,000 dozens of towels and socks, more than 5,000 pieces of farm tools, and more than 120,000 catties of dried noodles and vermicelli locally. Some regions have also convened internal material exchange meetings within the cooperative system to mutually adjust surpluses and deficiencies, overcoming the phenomenon of "out of stock in place A, stockpiled in place B." At the internal material exchange meeting convened by the Hanyuan County Cooperative Federation in Xikang Province, 13 kinds of commodities worth 300 million yuan were traded. These practices have played a significant role in expanding the organization of goods, supporting the purchase of agricultural products, and improving the management of cooperatives.

However, the supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas have not adequately prepared materials for spring plowing production and Spring Festival supply because they have not investigated the needs of farmers. Some have blindly purchased goods, and the commodities do not meet the needs of farmers. To this end, the Southwest Regional Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives recently issued instructions, requiring the affiliated cooperatives at all levels to check the preparation of spring plowing production materials and to do a good job in supplying materials for the Spring Festival.

### 西南区合作社积极组织手工业为农业服务

    西南区合作社积极组织手工业为农业服务
    西南区各地供销合作社配合收购粮食和棉花等工业原料的工作，大力供应农民生产资料和生活资料。全区供销合作社一九五三年全年零售计划完成约百分之一百一十，零售总额约为一九五二年的百分之二百二十。
    西南各地合作社在去年秋后相继扩大了零售网，到一九五三年年底，全区零售网发展到一万一千三百多个。不少地区采取“收购到那里，供应到那里”的办法，组织货郎担，供应组配合收购粮食，深入农村供应农民需要的物资。
    在组织货源中，西南各地合作社除进一步加强了和国营商业的联系，还大力组织了地方货源。四川省长寿、彭县、大竹等县许多地区的合作社召开手工业户座谈会，用发给原料或预付部分订金的办法，和手工业者签订订货合同，组织生产农民需要的手工业品。中共四川省绵阳县委会在去年十二月间召开全县手工业户代表会，向手工业户宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线。绵阳县合作社联合社在会上和手工业者签订了铧、蓑衣、晒席、扁担、粪桶等九千多件大小农具的加工合同；四川省新都县合作社联合社在去年十一月份召集各基层合作社开会，作出了组织地方货源，保证春节、春耕供应的决议。四川省简阳县合作社去年十二月在当地组织加工各种布匹六千多匹，毛巾、袜子四千多打，农具五千多件，挂面、粉条十二万余斤。有些地区还召开了合作社内部的物资交流会，互相调剂有无，克服“甲地脱销，乙地积压”的现象。西康省汉源县合作社联合社召开的内部物资交流会上，成交十三种商品即值三亿元。这些作法，对于扩大组织货源，支持农产品收购工作，以及改善合作社的经营管理都起了不少作用。
    但是部分地区的供销合作社因为没有调查农民的需要，春耕生产和春节供应物资准备得还不充分，有的盲目进货，商品不合农民的需要。为此，中华全国合作社联合总社西南区办事处日前发出指示，要求所属各级合作社检查春耕生产资料的准备工作，并作好春节物资供应工作。
