    I Will Greet the New Year with Hard Study and Good Guard Duty
    First-Class Guard Hero He Fuxiang
    I greet 1954 with full confidence in victory.
    I am a guard protecting the capital, and I participated in the National Combat Heroes Representative Conference held in Beijing in 1950. Now, I am studying culture at school.
    In order to better complete the task assigned to me by the Party of guarding the capital, I am determined to study culture well in 1954, so that I can better learn advanced Soviet military science and become a commander who is both civil and military.
    In the past few years, the motherland has completed the work of economic recovery and started the construction of the first five-year plan. This is the victory of Chairman Mao's leadership. With the development of the motherland's construction, the enemy will certainly step up their sabotage conspiracies, because every factory that starts operation and every mining plan that is completed is a new blow to the enemy, and they will certainly not be reconciled to our victory. My responsibility is to guard the capital. In 1954, I must further enhance my revolutionary vigilance, closely unite with the masses, and work hard to ensure the implementation of the general line, to defend the people's regime, and to suppress counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs.

    我要以努力学习、做好警卫工作来迎接新年
    一级警卫英雄　贺福祥
    我满怀着胜利的信心，迎接一九五四年。
    我是保卫首都的一个警卫人员，曾经参加过一九五○年在北京召开的全国战斗英雄代表会议。现在，我正在学校里学习文化。
    为了更好地完成党交给我的警卫首都的任务，我决心在一九五四年学好文化，以便更好地学习苏联先进军事科学，做一个文武双全的指挥员。
    在过去几年中，祖国完成了经济恢复工作，并开始了第一个五年计划建设。这是毛主席领导的胜利。随着祖国建设的发展，敌人一定会加紧进行阴谋破坏，因为每一个工厂的开工，每一个矿山开采计划的完成，都是对敌人新的打击，他们一定不甘心于我们的胜利。我的责任是警卫首都，在一九五四年，我一定要更加提高革命警惕性，紧密团结群众，为保证总路线的贯彻执行，为保卫人民政权，为镇压反革命和破坏分子而努力工作。
