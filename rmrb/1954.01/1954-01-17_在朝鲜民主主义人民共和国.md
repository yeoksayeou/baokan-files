    In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    Hwanghae Iron Works Begins Production
    On August 28th of last year, the construction of three sintering furnaces began at the Hwanghae Iron Works. Park Young-rim, a female worker who had been working in the refractory material workshop for eighteen years, was transferred here to participate in the furnace construction. During her work, two unforgettable events often came to her mind. One was the scene of her husband, an ironworker, sacrificing himself beside a blast furnace destroyed by enemy aircraft during the factory protection struggle in the early days of the war. The other was when the beloved leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, shook her hand and encouraged her to work hard at a sintering furnace ignition ceremony held at the factory after the "August 15th" liberation. Hatred for the enemy and gratitude to the leader made her work even harder. On September 30th, the group of workers she led was the first to repair a sintering furnace, and cheers rang out on the construction site. Then, on October 10th and October 25th, they successively repaired the other two sintering furnaces. Now, the first repaired sintering furnace has begun to produce high-quality refractory bricks.
    Restoration work is proceeding intensely. The oxygen workshop recently installed new machinery from the Soviet Union, which has improved work efficiency. The rolling mill has started operating, and rolling workers Kim Eung-soon and Kim Geun-ik are completing their production quotas at 140 percent. The casting department has also begun producing pots, furnace bars, and plows.
    The Revival of Sunghori Cement Factory
    Restoring power facilities is the key to restoring production at the Sunghori Cement Factory. To this end, the workers in the electrical workshop held a meeting to discuss the issue of collecting equipment. An Chang-ho, a technician who had worked in the factory for fifteen years, knew very well about the electrical equipment hidden during the war. He said one by one: "The large transformer is buried under the mountain, the wires are in the basement, the switches are in the air-raid shelter, and the large engine is also buried under the mountain..." After the meeting, he went to the construction site to excavate and transport equipment despite his illness. The equipment was quickly collected, iron towers and utility poles were erected, and the external lines, transformers, and motors were all installed. At 11:09 AM on August 9th of last year, Choi Ki-dong, the head of the power workshop, nervously turned on the switch, and the current quickly flowed to each workshop. They completed the preliminary restoration plan for the electrical department twenty days ahead of schedule.
    The pipe workers also launched intense work to restore the drying kiln. Kim Byung-rok, a skilled worker with twenty years of experience, put on a water-soaked straw bag and bravely climbed into the hot iron pipes of the drying kiln to repair it. Hwang Byung-oh's work team conducted the crusher test twenty days ahead of schedule. Now, the drying kiln is emitting flames, and the crusher is also running. The factory can now produce 130 to 140 tons of cement per day. The workers sent the first batch of cement to Pyongyang and Hwanghae Iron Works to support the reconstruction work there.
      New Workers' Residences in Pyongyang
    Longhung-dong, Pyongyang, which was once in ruins, now has rows of neat workers' residences. New owners have already moved into these tidy homes.
      Train driver Lee Jong-gil moved into house number one, cigarette worker Lee Hee-soon moved into house number two, construction worker Jang Byung-chan moved into house number three...
    In the morning, workers, technicians, and staff came out of the doors of more than sixty households, busy heading to factories and construction sites. Jang Byung-chan and his eldest son have both gone to work, and his daughter Sun-hee has also gone to school. Only Sun-hee's mother is left at home. Looking at the smoke rising from the chimneys in the morning, Sun-hee's mother couldn't help but recall the events of July 1951. One day, enemy planes dropped a large number of bombs on this street, and her second son, Do-young, and many neighbors were killed. How painful she was at that time! She also remembered the hard life during the war and the intense work to win the victory. Now, looking at the comfortable and beautiful new house and the fragrant wild chrysanthemums in the vase, she felt an indescribable happiness.
    After dusk, bright electric lights shone from the windows of every household. The Jang Byung-chan family has returned home. They are chatting under the light. Jang Byung-chan and his eldest son are talking about the work on the construction site during the day and the vision of a happy life in the future. Sun-hee's mother is listening with great interest. Daughter Sun-hee quickly falls asleep peacefully after dinner.
      Tractors Gallop Across the Fields of Jaeryong
    Before the autumn plowing last year, the Jaeryong Tractor Station delivered twenty brand new tractors. The tractor drivers held an autumn plowing meeting and planned to plow more than 6,000 hectares of paddy fields here in thirty-five days. A competition immediately broke out between the various work groups. Many tractor drivers exceeded their work quotas. Female tractor driver Kim Si-ho completed 130 percent of her task every day, and Kang Yong-dal, the No. 6 tractor driver of the Democratic Youth League work group, exceeded his personal plan with a score of 150 percent. During the Japanese rule, this land only yielded five to six tons of rice per hectare; now, the yield per hectare has increased to fourteen to fifteen tons.
    Tractor drivers have become the closest friends of the farmers. A farmer named Jeon Bok-sil said: "Tractors are really rare things! In the past, we used oxen to plow the land, and no matter how hard you pressed, you couldn't plow very deep. Now, tractors plow the land quickly, deeply, and evenly, saving labor and producing more rice, which is really satisfying. We believe that the government will give us more tractors in the future, and we also guarantee to strive for a greater harvest."

    在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国
    黄海制铁所开始生产
    去年八月二十八日，黄海制铁所三个烧成炉的筑炉工作开始了。在耐火物车间工作了十八年的女工朴英林，被调到这里参加筑炉工作。在工作中，有两件难忘的事常常浮现在她的脑海里。一件是她的丈夫——一个炼铁工人，在战争初期的护厂斗争中，牺牲在被敌机炸毁的炼铁炉旁的情景；还有一件是在“八·一五”解放后工厂举行的一次烧成炉的引火式上，敬爱的领袖金日成元帅和她握手，鼓励她努力工作的情景。对敌人的仇恨和对领袖的感激，都使她在工作中更加努力。九月三十日，她领导的一组工人首先把一个烧成炉修复了，工地上响起一片欢呼。接着，十月十日和十月二十五日，他们又先后修复了另外两个烧成炉。现在，最先修复的烧成炉，已经开始生产质量优良的耐火砖了。
    恢复工作正在紧张地进行着。酸素车间最近装上了新从苏联运来的机器，提高了工作效率。压延机开始了操作，压延工人金应淳和金根益，正以百分之一百四十的成绩完成着生产定额。铸造部门也已开始生产锅、炉条、耕犁了。
    胜湖里水泥厂的复活
    恢复动力设施，是恢复胜湖里水泥工厂生产的关键。为此，电气车间的工人召开了一次会议，讨论收集器材的问题。在这个工厂里工作了十五年的技工安昌浩，对在战争中隐藏起来的电气器材知道得非常清楚，他一件一件地说出来：“大变压器埋在山下，电线放在地下室里，电门放在防空壕里，大发动机也埋在山下……”会后，他就带病到工地挖掘和搬运器材，很快器材收集起来了，铁塔和电线杆竖立起来了，外线、变压器和电动机都安装好了。去年八月九日上午十一时九分，动力车间的负责人崔基东紧张地开了电门，电流很快地流向各车间。他们提前二十天完成了电气部门的初步恢复计划。
    制管工人也展开了恢复干燥炉的紧张工作。二十年工龄的熟练工人金炳禄，披上了浇了水的草包，勇敢地爬进灼热的干燥炉的铁管里去，把它修复了。黄炳五工作班提前二十天进行了粉碎机的试验。现在，干燥炉已经冒出了火苗，粉碎机也转动起来，这个工厂每天已可生产一百三十到一百四十吨水泥了。工人们把最先生产出来的水泥，送到平壤和黄海制铁所去，支援那里的重建工作。
      平壤市的工人新居
    不久前还是一片废墟的平壤市龙兴洞，现在出现了一排排整齐的工人住宅。在这些整洁的住宅里，已经住了新的主人了。
      搬到一号住宅里住的是火车司机李钟吉，搬到二号的是卷烟工人李熙顺，搬到三号的是建筑工人张秉灿……。
    早晨，工人、技师和职员们从六十多家的大门里走出来，忙着赶往工厂和建筑工地去。张秉灿和他的大儿子都上工去了，他的女儿善姬也上学去了，家里只剩下善姬的母亲。善姬的母亲望着早晨的炊烟，不禁想起了一九五一年七月间的事。一天，敌机在这条街道上投下了大批炸弹，她的二儿子道永、还有不少邻人都牺牲了，她当时是多么痛苦啊！她又想起战争期间艰苦的生活和为了争取胜利紧张工作的情形。现在，她看着舒适漂亮的新住宅，看着瓶里插着的香味扑鼻的野菊花，她感到一种难言的幸福。
    黄昏后，家家的窗口都放出了明亮的电灯光。张秉灿一家人都回来了。他们在灯光下谈天。张秉灿和大儿子谈着白天在工地上工作的情形，谈着未来幸福生活的远景。善姬的母亲在一旁很有兴味地听着。女儿善姬，吃过饭很快就安然入睡了。
      拖拉机奔驰在载宁田野上
    去年秋耕前，载宁拖拉机站运来了二十辆崭新的拖拉机。拖拉机手们召开了秋耕会议，计划用三十五天的时间犁完这里六千多公顷的水田。各个工作组之间立刻展开了竞赛。很多拖拉机手都超过了自己的工作定额。女拖拉机手金时好，每天完成百分之一百三十的任务，民青工作组的第六号拖拉机手姜庸达，更以百分之一百五十的成绩，超额完成了个人的计划。在日本统治时期，这块地上每公顷只收获五吨到六吨稻子；现在，每公顷的收获量已增加到十四到十五吨了。
    拖拉机手们已成农民们最亲近的朋友了。一位名叫全福实的农妇说：“拖拉机真是稀罕的东西呀！从前我们用牛耕地，不管你压得多么重也耕不了多深。现在用拖拉机耕地耕得又快又深又匀，既节省了力气，又多打了稻子，真使人称心如意。我们相信：政府今后一定会给我们更多的拖拉机，我们也保证争取更大的丰收。”
