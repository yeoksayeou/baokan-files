Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: A dispatch from our special correspondent reports: In his reply on the 16th to General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, regarding Thimayya's letter of the 14th, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, Hull, stated that when Thimayya begins returning prisoners of war to their original detaining sides starting on January 20th, he will "arrange to receive" them. He also emphasized that Thimayya's suggestion of so-called returning prisoners of war "does not affect in the slightest" the U.S.'s established plan to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war at Tongjang-ni on January 23rd.

In his reply, Hull attempted to deny all the facts affirmed in the "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and Thimayya's letter regarding the U.S. side's violations of the agreement and the forced detention of prisoners of war. Hull disregarded the facts in his letter, saying, "The United Nations Command has sincerely handed over the prisoners of war under its supervision to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, believing that each prisoner of war will have ample opportunity to hear explanations and freely make choices about his future without any threat." However, the facts listed in the "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" prove that Hull's so-called "sincerity," "ample opportunity," and "freely, without any threat" are complete lies. The "Interim Report" clearly pointed out in its conclusion: "Prisoners of war did not enjoy the freedom to seek repatriation while in the camps and were under force or threat of force." Even prisoners of war who underwent individual explanations in the southern camp were not "completely free from force or threat of force from prisoner of war camp organizations and their leaders, and who have close ties to the prisoner of war camp organizations and their leaders." The conclusion of the "Interim Report" shows that the "activities of these" special agent organizations under U.S. command "undermined the Commission's custody and control, and made it extremely difficult to establish the freedom of choice for prisoners of war at any time."

In his letter, Hull disregarded the facts and said that the U.S. had made "sincere efforts" to "explain to the prisoners of war their right to repatriation" and that the U.S. had "endeavored to assist" the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in its explanatory work to the prisoners of war. However, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission clearly pointed out in its "Interim Report" that, before handing over the prisoners of war, the U.S. not only failed to ensure that they correctly understood the terms of the "Terms of Reference," as stipulated, but instead distorted the "Terms of Reference" to the prisoners of war, claiming that prisoners of war did not have to attend the explanations. As for what good "assistance" the U.S. provided throughout the explanatory work, a large portion of the Commission's "Interim Report" has already explained. Due to the U.S.'s planned obstruction and disruption from beginning to end, the explanatory work was repeatedly interrupted, with the result that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was "unable to thoroughly carry out the tasks of the Commission in accordance with the 'Terms of Reference.'"

While Hull tried to deny the U.S.'s responsibility for violating the "Terms of Reference" and the explanatory work, disrupting the political conference, and forcibly detaining prisoners of war, he also attempted to shift the responsibility to the Korean and Chinese side out of thin air. Hull said that the reason why the explanations could not proceed smoothly was because the Korean and Chinese side demanded "the use of force against prisoners of war." However, it is well known throughout the world that it was the U.S. military and the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents it directed who consistently used force to carry out terrorist rule over the prisoners of war. According to Article 3 of the "Terms of Reference," the Korean and Chinese side demanded that the terrorist rule of special agents in the prisoner of war camps be broken and that the prisoners of war be guaranteed against the force and threat of force from U.S. special agents. However, due to the U.S.'s stubborn obstruction and multifaceted pressure, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force ultimately failed to take the necessary measures in accordance with the "Terms of Reference," resulting in a constant stream of special agent atrocities in the prisoner of war camps and the destruction of the explanatory work. Hull can never exonerate the U.S. from its guilt by lying.

Hull also attempted to push the responsibility for the U.S.'s dragging out the convocation of the political conference onto the Korean and Chinese side out of thin air. He reversed right and wrong, saying: "The United Nations Command has made every effort to convene the political conference recommended in Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement and mentioned in Article 11 of the 'Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission,' the task of which was to consider the disposition of the prisoners of war within the specifically stipulated thirty-day period. These efforts have all been interrupted by the other side." However, the course of the Panmunjom bilateral talks showed that it was none other than U.S. representative Dean who delayed and even interrupted the talks. He insisted that the prisoner of war issue had nothing to do with the political conference and that, regardless of whether the political conference was convened, the U.S.'s "release" of prisoners of war would be like a "time-locked vault." It was precisely in order to forcibly detain the prisoners of war that the U.S. used every trick, and finally fabricated a senseless excuse to interrupt the bilateral talks, preventing the political conference from being convened quickly. These clear records are already well known.

In his letter, Hull shed crocodile tears, saying that the U.S. was considering so-called "humanity and justice," and repeatedly mentioned the "Terms of Reference." But aren't the bloody facts of the U.S. directing special agents to massacre and torture prisoners of war, obstructing repatriation, trampling on the human rights of prisoners of war, and forcibly detaining prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder enough? Now, the U.S. is even prepared to act arbitrarily to the end, attempting to forcibly detain the prisoners of war and hand them over to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to be forcibly used as cannon fodder. Can people still find even a trace of "humanity and justice" here?

After putting on a hypocritical and nauseating set of "arguments," Hull expressed his "belief" and "principle" that he would carry out his "detailed plan" to forcibly detain these prisoners of war in one fell swoop on January 23rd. Hull scorned General Thimayya's warning in his letter that any unilateral action regarding the treatment of prisoners of war would be inconsistent with the "Terms of Reference," and arrogantly affirmed that he would kidnap the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war at 00:01 on January 23rd. Hull also used the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's failure to strictly adhere to the error of the "Terms of Reference" to turn the tables and accuse the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission of "dereliction of duty" for not implementing the U.S.'s original plan to kidnap the prisoners of war.

Hull's reply to Thimayya exposed the U.S.'s consistent contempt for the "Terms of Reference" and the arrogant face of contempt for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, proving that the U.S., due to its political and moral bankruptcy, can only use the method of hard lying to shirk its responsibility for violating the prisoner of war agreement and to find grounds for the U.S.'s predetermined unforgivable act of forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on January 23rd. However, Hull's wishful thinking was shattered by the facts as soon as it was put forward. Obviously, none of the U.S.'s tricks can allow it to escape its guilt in the face of fair world public opinion.

    赫尔致函蒂迈雅坚持要按照计划劫夺战俘
    证明美方准备蛮干到底彻底破坏战俘协议
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者报道：远东美军总司令赫尔在十六日答复中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军十四日的信里表示将在蒂迈雅自一月二十日开始把战俘交还给原拘留一方时，“安排收容”他们，同时强调蒂迈雅的所谓交还战俘的建议“丝毫不影响”美方在一月二十三日强迫扣留东场里朝中战俘的既定计划。
    赫尔在复信中企图把“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”和蒂迈雅信中肯定的美方破坏协议、强迫扣留战俘的种种事实一口赖净。赫尔在信中不顾事实地说：“联合国军司令部诚心诚意地把它看管下的战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会，深信每个战俘将获得充分机会来听取解释，并自由地、丝毫不受威胁地对自己的前途作出抉择。”但是“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”所列举的事实，证明赫尔的所谓“诚心诚意”“充分机会”“自由地、丝毫不受威胁地”完全是谎话。“临时报告”在其结论中曾经明白指出：“战俘当其在营场中时均未享有寻求遣返的自由，并处于武力或武力威胁之下”，甚至南营中经过个别解释的战俘也不能“完全免于来自战俘营组织与其领导的、并与战俘营组织与其领导有密切联系的武力或武力威胁”。“临时报告”的结论表明美方指挥下的特务组织的“这些活动削弱了本委员会的看管和控制，并使其在任何时候建立战俘有选择的自由的工作异常困难”。
    赫尔在他的信里并不顾事实地说，美方曾“作了真诚的努力”向战俘“解释他们遣返的权利”，又说美方曾“设法协助”中立国遣返委员会进行对战俘的解释工作。但是，中立国遣返委员会在其“临时报告”中明白指出，美方在移交战俘之前，不但没有按照规定使他们正确地了解“职权范围”的条款，反而向战俘曲解“职权范围”，声称战俘不必出席听解释。至于在整个解释工作中美方究竟提供了什么好的“协助”，委员会“临时报告”的很大一部分篇幅已经作了说明，由于美方自始至终的有计划的破坏阻挠，解释工作一再中断，其结果使中立国遣返委员会“无法按照‘职权范围’彻底执行本委员会之任务”。
    赫尔一方面想抵赖美方破坏“职权范围”和解释工作、破坏政治会议强迫扣留战俘的责任，一方面妄想凭空把责任转嫁到朝中方面身上。赫尔说什么解释之所以不能顺利进行是因为朝中方面要求“对战俘使用武力”，但是举世周知，一贯对战俘使用武力进行恐怖统治的正是美军和它所指使的蒋李特务。朝中方面根据“职权范围”第三款，要求打破战俘营中的特务恐怖统治，保证战俘不致遭受美方特务的武力和武力威胁。但是由于美方的横蛮的阻挠和多方的压力，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队终于未能按照“职权范围”采取必要措施，以致战俘营中特务暴行层出不穷，解释工作横遭破坏。赫尔决不能用说谎来解脱美方的罪责。
    赫尔并企图把美方拖延政治会议的召开的责任凭空推到朝中方面。他颠倒是非地说：“联合国军方面曾尽一切努力，以图召开停战协定第六十款所建议的，以及‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’第十一款所提到的政治会议，这个会议的任务是在具体规定的三十天期间内考虑战俘们的处理问题。这些努力都已被其他一方所打断。”但是，板门店双方会谈的经过表明，拖延以至中断会谈的不是别人，而是美国代表迪安。他一口咬定战俘问题与政治会议无关，不管是否召开政治会议，美方“释放”战俘要像“定时开启的保险库”一样。正是为了要强迫扣留战俘，美方才耍尽手段，最后并制造一个毫无道理的借口来中断双方会谈，使政治会议不能迅速召开，这些明明白白的记录已是众所周知的。
    赫尔在信中猫哭老鼠地说什么美方考虑的是所谓“人道与正义”，口口声声是“职权范围”，但是美方指挥特务屠杀、拷打战俘，阻挠遣返，蹂躏战俘人权，强迫扣留战俘充当炮灰的种种血腥事实难道还不够吗？现在，美方更准备蛮干到底，企图不顾一切地把战俘强迫扣留下来交给李、蒋匪帮强迫充当炮灰。人们从这里难道还能找到一丝一毫的“人道与正义”的影子么？
    赫尔在装模作样地摆出一套虚伪的令人作呕的“论据”之后，表明他的“信念”和“原则”就是要在一月二十三日来执行他所拟订的把这些战俘一举而强迫扣留下来的“详细计划”。赫尔蔑视蒂迈雅将军信中所提出的对于战俘的处理的任何片面行动都是不符合“职权范围”的警告，蛮横地肯定要在一月二十三日零时一分劫夺朝中战俘。赫尔并利用中立国遣返委员会未能严守“职权范围”的错误，倒打一耙，指责中立国遣返委员会没有实行美方劫夺战俘的原定计划是“失职”。
    赫尔给蒂迈雅的答复暴露了美方一贯的蔑视“职权范围”、蔑视中立国遣返委员会的横暴嘴脸，证明了美方由于在政治上、道义上的破产，因此只有用硬赖的方法来推卸破坏战俘协议的责任，并为美方预定的在一月二十三日强迫扣留朝中战俘这一罪恶的不可饶恕的勾当寻找根据。但是赫尔的如意算盘一出手就被事实粉碎了，美方的任何伎俩显然都绝不能使它在世界公正舆论的面前逃脱其罪责。
