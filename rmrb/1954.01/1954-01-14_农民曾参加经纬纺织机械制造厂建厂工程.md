    Farmers Participated in the Construction of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Plant
    The state-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Plant, which has already been put into production, received strong support from local farmers during its construction.
    The Jingwei Textile Machinery Plant officially started construction in May 1951. Before the start of construction, a large number of farmers, under the leadership of the local Communist Party committee, enthusiastically participated in the preparation work. In a very short period of time, more than 300 farmers built a railway and a highway from the railway station to the factory area. Nearby rural areas also organized more than 200 horse-drawn carts and thousands of farmers to participate in the transportation and loading and unloading of materials. By the time construction officially started in May, they had transported hundreds of thousands of tons of materials needed for the construction project, such as steel bars and cement, to the construction site. After the start of construction, more than 2,000 people participated in the construction of civil engineering projects. Hundreds of women and children helped the factory break tens of thousands of cubic meters of gravel. The rural militia near the factory also came to help the factory patrol and guard equipment.
    During the two-year construction process, the farmers helped the construction workers overcome many difficulties. In the summer of 1951, when construction was in full swing, the roads became muddy due to heavy rain, and the materials used for construction could not be transported to the construction site. The farmers organized more than 30 handcarts to transport bricks, tiles, and lime to the construction site. When the tall steel frame of the factory building had been erected and a generator was urgently needed for riveting work, the generator could not be transported because the road was washed away by water. The farmers immediately organized repairs and transported the generator to the construction site within four hours, ensuring the smooth progress of the project. During the construction process, the farmers not only provided great help to the construction workers in their work, but also provided all-round care in their lives. In April 1951, when a large number of workers came to the factory, the factory's dormitory had not yet been built, and nearby farmers vacated more than 300 rooms for the workers. In summer, farmers traveled more than ten miles to sell a large number of melons and fruits, so that the workers could eat cheap fruits on the construction site. In the autumn, the farmers expanded more than 300 mu of vegetable gardens, providing the workers with thousands of kilograms of vegetables.
    The farmers who helped build the Jingwei Textile Machinery Plant also received education in national industrialization during the construction process and improved their ideological awareness. The factory workers often invited farmers to visit the factory and hold worker-peasant alliance forums, and regularly showed movies to the farmers. Nearby rural areas also connected more than 200 electric lights from the factory, which greatly broadened the farmers' horizons and enabled them to see the socialist prospects.

### 农民曾参加经纬纺织机械制造厂建厂工程

    农民曾参加经纬纺织机械制造厂建厂工程
    已经投入生产的国营经纬纺织机械制造厂在建厂过程中曾得到当地农民的大力帮助。
    经纬纺织机械制造厂是一九五一年五月正式动工兴建的。施工前，大批农民在当地中共党委的领导下踊跃地参加了施工的准备工作。在很短的时间内，有三百多个农民为工厂修筑了由火车站通往厂区的铁路和公路。附近农村还组织了二百多辆马车和数以千计的农民参加了材料运输和装卸工作。到五月正式动工时，他们就把数十万吨的钢筋、水泥等建筑工程所需要的材料运到工地。施工开始后，有两千多人参加了土木建筑工程的建设工作。成百的妇女和儿童帮助该厂打了数万方石子。临近工厂的农村民兵也来帮助工厂巡查和看管器材。
    在两年多的建厂过程中，农民们帮助建厂工人克服了许多困难。一九五一年夏天，正当紧张施工的时候，由于落雨较多，道路泥泞，施工所用的材料不能运到工地，农民们就组织了三十多辆手推车，把砖瓦和石灰运到施工地点。当工厂机工厂房的高大钢架已经竖起，急需发电机进行铆接工作时，发电机却因通路被水冲毁不能运来，农民们立刻组织抢修，四小时内就把发电机运到工地，保证了工程顺利进行。在建厂过程中，农民们不仅在工作上给了建厂工人很大帮助，在生活上也给了多方面的照顾。一九五一年四月，大批工人来到工厂时，工厂的宿舍还没有盖好，附近农民就给工人腾出了三百多间房子。夏天，农民们从十多里远的地方挑贩回大批瓜果，使工人们在工地上能吃到便宜的水果。秋天，农民们又扩充了三百多亩菜园，供给了工人数千斤蔬菜。
    帮助建设经纬纺织机械制造厂的农民，在建厂过程中也受到了国家工业化的教育，提高了思想觉悟。该厂工人经常请农民到工厂参观和举行工农联盟座谈会，并定期地给农民放映电影，附近农村还从工厂接了二百多盏电灯，大大开扩了农民的眼界，使农民看到了社会主义远景。（新华社）
