    Winter Night Dream
    Soviet Union, Kukryniksy, Painting, Marshak, Poem
    In the dead of night, McCarthy had a strange dream. He dreamed that he was lying in the starry sky. He soared above the clouds, sleeping among the sun and the moon, with a locked Earth clamped under his arm, stopping its rotation. McCarthy dreamed that the vast world was all within his secret agent's net; Paris was in chains, Rome was in shackles, and the American Yankees had become the masters of the world. Instead of the past year, the new year has arrived. "Who is this madman?" someone was heard asking by the door. "It's not the whole world that's gone mad," was the reply: "It's the various McCarthys, who have been suffering from war fever for years."

          the Soviet "Pravda")

    冬夜之梦
    苏联  库克雷尼克赛　画  马尔夏克  诗半夜三更，麦卡锡做了个怪梦。他梦见自己躺在满天星斗的太空。他飞腾在云层之上，睡在太阳和月亮当中，一个上了锁的地球，被他夹在腋下停止转动。麦卡锡梦见：偌大世界都在他暗探的网罗之中；巴黎套着锁链，罗马上了镣铐，美国佬成了世界的主人翁。代替过去了的一年，新的一年已经来临。“这个疯子是谁？”忽听门旁有人在问。“发疯的不是全世界，”这是回答的声音：“那是各色各样的麦卡锡们，他们多少年来一直害着战争狂热症。”
