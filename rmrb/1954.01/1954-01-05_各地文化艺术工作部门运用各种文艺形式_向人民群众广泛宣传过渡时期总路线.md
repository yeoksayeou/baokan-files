Cultural and Art Work Departments in Various Regions Use Various Literary and Artistic Forms to Widely Publicize the General Line of the Transition Period to the People

Cultural and art work departments across the country are widely using various literary and artistic forms to actively publicize the general line and general task of the state during the transition period to the broad masses of urban and rural people.

The cultural work teams participating in this publicity work across the country are unprecedentedly large, including thousands of cultural centers, cultural stations, and film projection teams launched by local cultural authorities, hundreds of theater troupes and cinemas, countless clubs and factories, rural amateur theater troupes, and many libraries and museums. Currently, cultural centers in many counties and cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi, Hubei, Yunnan, Sichuan, Xikang, Heilongjiang and other provinces have begun to hold exhibitions of pictures and objects publicizing the general line. Staff members of cultural centers and stations in Sichuan have already taken more than 1,000 slide projectors and gone to the countryside to carry out publicity. Jilin Province has organized nearly 1,000 literary and artistic teams to participate in the publicity, and they have performed more than 2,300 shows. In its publicity efforts, Jilin Province has also held more than 1,000 picture and object exhibitions and screened more than 1,800 slide shows. The Songjiang County Cultural Center in Jiangsu Province organized more than 60 rural storytellers to carry out publicity activities in rural areas, storytelling venues, teahouses, streets, and other places where the masses gathered. The 32 detachments of the Shaanxi Provincial Film Education Work Team and the more than 80 mobile film projection teams of Sichuan Province have all set out with films publicizing the general line to tour various places. The publicity team of the Northwest Opera Research Institute has gone to Weinan Prefecture in Shaanxi to give publicity performances. Literary and art workers from the Northwest Song and Dance Troupe have also gone to the countryside to conduct publicity. In addition, five theater troupes in Beijing, including the Central Experimental Opera House, the South China Drama Troupe of Guangdong, the South China Cantonese Opera Troupe, and the Cantonese opera circles in Guangzhou will go to the suburbs, rural areas, and streets around the Spring Festival to give publicity performances and guide mass amateur literary and artistic activities. The Shanghai Huju Opera Troupe is preparing to perform a Huju opera entitled "Water Flows to the Yangtze River and Returns to the Sea" with the theme of rural mutual aid and cooperation.

In the work of publicizing the general line through literary and artistic forms, various places have adopted diverse forms and lively methods, and generally pay attention to combining publicity with the local actual situation. The forms adopted in various places include films, dramas, local operas, storytelling, clapper talk, songs, comic strips, propaganda posters, slides, pictures, blackboards, radio broadcasts, and so on. The exhibitions held by many cultural centers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Heilongjiang and other provinces to help farmers calculate accounts use pictures and objects to explain the specific situation and true stories of the locality, vividly and powerfully pointing out to farmers that only by following the road of mutual aid and cooperation can they gradually get rid of poverty. Cultural centers in Nehe, Tailai, Zhaodong and other counties in Heilongjiang Province went to grain shops, caravanserais and people's homes to broadcast, hold picture exhibitions, and perform small-scale literary and artistic programs, making the publicity of the general line known to every household. The Dali County Cultural Center in Shaanxi Province sent the "Cultural Load," which was welcomed by the masses, to the mountainous areas to publicize the general line to the farmers. In addition to pictures, slides, and books, the "Cultural Load" also carried a radio, organizing the masses to listen to broadcasts about the general line at any time. The publicity personnel of the Linxian County Cultural Center in Shanxi Province used storytelling in conjunction with blackboards, turning the dead blackboards into lively blackboards, which played a very good role.

The publicity activities on the general line carried out by the cultural and art departments in various places using literary and artistic forms have had a profound impact on the broad masses of farmers, making them feel vividly that only by taking the socialist road can they be happy, and they have sold their surplus grain to the state one after another, and requested to join mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives. In many counties in Jiangsu, Sichuan and other provinces, the cultural centers first held exhibitions to help farmers calculate accounts at enlarged meetings of district and township cadres, which greatly helped the district and township cadres to concretely understand the general line, and also helped them prepare materials for publicity when they returned. The object and picture exhibition in the 16th district of Jiutai County, Jilin, Northeast China, made many elderly farmers happy that they could still see socialism. After seeing the mobile exhibition and slide show, the farmers in Taiping Village, Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, sold 50,000 jin of grain to the state within two days and actively demanded to be organized.

Before using literary and artistic forms to publicize the general line, most of the cultural and art departments and their staff members in various places systematically studied the general line under the leadership of the local Party committees and cultural authorities. (Xinhua News Agency)

    各地文化艺术工作部门运用各种文艺形式
    向人民群众广泛宣传过渡时期总路线
    全国各地文化艺术工作部门广泛利用各种文艺形式，积极向广大的城市和农村人民群众宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。
    各地参加这一宣传工作的文化工作队是空前巨大的，其中有各地文化主管部门发动的几千个文化馆、文化站、电影放映队，几百个剧团和电影院，无数的俱乐部和工厂，农村业余剧团，以及许多图书馆和博物馆。现在江苏、浙江、安徽、河北、山西、湖北、云南、四川、西康、黑龙江等省许多县市的文化馆都已开始举办宣传总路线的图片和实物展览。四川各文化馆、站的工作人员已经携带了一千多部幻灯机，分头深入农村进行宣传。吉林省组织了近一千个文艺队伍参加宣传，他们已演出了二千三百多场。吉林省在宣传中还举办了一千多场图片和实物展览，放映了一千八百多场幻灯。江苏松江县文化馆组织了农村说书艺人六十多人，在农村、书场、茶馆、街头等群众聚集的场所展开宣传活动。陕西省电影教育工作队的三十二个分队，四川省的八十多个电影流动放映队都已携带宣传总路线的电影片，出发赴各地巡回放映。西北戏曲研究院的宣传队已到陕西渭南专区作宣传演出。西北歌舞团的文艺工作者也已经下乡宣传。此外北京的中央实验歌剧院等五个剧团，广东的华南话剧团、华南粤剧团以及广州市的粤剧界都将在春节前后分别到市郊、农村和街头作宣传演出，并辅导群众业余文艺活动。上海沪剧团正在准备演出一部以农村互助合作为主题的沪剧“水流长江归大海”。
    各地在通过文艺形式宣传总路线的工作中，形式多色多样，方法生动活泼，一般都注意到结合当地实际情况进行宣传。各地采用的形式有电影、话剧、地方戏、说唱、快板、歌曲、连环画、宣传画、幻灯、图片、黑板报、广播等等。江苏、浙江、四川、黑龙江等省的许多文化馆所举行的帮农民算账的展览会，以图片实物说明本地的具体情况和真人真事，生动有力地向农民指出了只有走互助合作的路才能逐步摆脱穷困。黑龙江讷河、泰来、肇东等县的文化馆到粮栈、大车店和群众家里去作广播，举办图片展览，演出小型文艺节目，使总路线的宣传作到了家喻户晓。陕西大荔县文化馆派出群众所欢迎的“文化担”到山区去向农民宣传总路线。“文化担”除带有图片、幻灯、书籍外，还带有收音机，随时组织群众收听关于总路线的广播。山西临县文化馆宣传人员用说唱配合黑板报，把死黑板报变成了活黑板报，起了很好的作用。
    各地文化艺术部门运用文艺形式所进行的关于总路线的宣传活动，在广大的农民群众中间已发生了极为深刻的影响，使他们形象地感觉到只有走社会主义的道路才是幸福的道路，纷纷把余粮卖给国家，和请求参加互助组和农业生产合作社。江苏、四川等省的许多县都由文化馆先在区乡干部扩大会议上举办帮农民算账的展览会，因而大大帮助了区乡干部具体地认识总路线，也帮助了他们准备了回去进行宣传的材料。东北吉林九台县十六区的实物和图片展览会，使许多老年农民都感到自己还可以看到社会主义而高兴。四川荣昌县太平村农民在看过流动展览会和幻灯片后，两天之内向国家出售了五万斤粮食，并积极要求组织起来。
    各地文化艺术部门工作人员在运用文艺形式进行总路线的宣传之前，大多数都在当地党委和文化主管部门的领导之下，集中地系统地学习了总路线。（新华社）
