    Shanxi Province, Pingshun County, Repairs Ponds and Digs Wells
    Basic Solution to People's Domestic Water Problem
    In addition to universally mobilizing the masses to repair ponds and dig wells and store water for use, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, also built a larger reservoir near Chengguan—the "People's Pond"—last year, which basically solved the problem of domestic water for the people.
    In order to solve the difficulty of domestic water for the people of Pingshun County, in April last year, the Central People's Government and the Shanxi Provincial People's Government successively sent more than 40 water conservancy and geological workers to Pingshun County to conduct more than three months of underground water source exploration work. The exploration results showed that Pingshun County has thick stone and thin soil, and the underground water is deep. It is difficult to utilize underground water sources. It is necessary to dig wells and repair ponds to gather and store surface water, close mountains for afforestation, and absorb underground water sources. Therefore, the county called on the people of the county to dig wells and repair ponds in large numbers, and close mountains for afforestation. Last year, the county has dug a total of 435 dry wells, 104 dry ponds, and 5 live water wells. In order to meet the needs of the increasing population of Chengguan and proceed from long-term interests, a stone reservoir was built at the confluence of the two rivers southwest of Chengguan. This project started in late August last year and was completed on November 22. The entire pond can hold 171,000 dan of water. Calculated at 100 dan of water per person per year, one full pond of water can supply 1,700 people for one year.
    Pingshun County is located on the top of the Taihang Mountains, with little rain and water shortage. The people of the county often suffer from water shortages. The people of Chengguan sometimes have to fetch water 20 miles away. Especially in the cold winter and busy spring, the masses often look for water outside all night. Since the establishment of the Anti-Japanese Democratic Government, the local Party and government organs have led the people to repair ponds and dig wells over the years, and the water shortage problem has been initially resolved. Now, with the addition of the ponds and wells built last year, the problem of domestic water for the people can be basically solved.

    山西省平顺县修池打井
    人民生活用水问题基本解决
    山西平顺县去年除普遍发动群众修池打井、蓄水备用外，并在城关附近修建了一个较大蓄水池——“人民池”，基本上解决了人民生活用水问题。
    为了解决平顺县人民生活用水困难，去年四月间，中央人民政府和山西省人民政府先后派出水利、地质工作人员四十余人，到平顺县进行了三个多月的地下水源探测工作。探测结果，认为平顺县石厚土薄，地下藏水较深，利用地下水源较困难，必须打井修池，聚蓄地面水量，并封山育林，吸取地下水源。于是县里便号召全县人民大量打井修池，封山造林。全县去年共计已打旱井四百三十五眼，旱池一百零四个，活水井五眼。为了适应城关人口日渐增加的需要，从长远利益出发，在城关西南两河汇流处建筑一个石砌蓄水池。这一工程从去年八月下旬动工，已在十一月二十二日完工。全池可容水十七万一千担，按每人每年用水一百担计算，蓄满一池水可供一千七百多人一年吃用。
    平顺县位于太行山顶，雨少水缺，全县人民常遭水荒，城关人民有时要到二十里外取水，特别是寒冬和春忙时，群众经常通夜在外找水。自抗日民主政权建立时起，当地党、政机关历年领导人民修池打井，水荒问题已初步解决。现在再加上去年所修的池、井，人民生活用水问题基本可以解决。
