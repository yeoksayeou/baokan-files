    Jixi Mining Bureau Manufactures Donbass Type I Combined Coal Mining Machine

    The staff and workers of the Jixi Mining Bureau's General Machinery Plant successfully trial-manufactured the first "Donbass Type I Combined Coal Mining Machine." A land test run was conducted on December 20th of last year, and the operation was good.

    The "Donbass Type I Combined Coal Mining Machine" is one of the world's most outstanding coal mining machines produced by the Soviet Union. It can directly cut coal blocks from the mine and load them onto a chain conveyor without manual labor, completely replacing the heavy physical labor of coal miners.

    In early 1953, the staff and workers of the General Machinery Plant accepted the task of trial manufacturing. During the trial manufacturing process, all workers and technicians actively studied advanced Soviet experience, carefully followed Soviet design drawings, and overcame numerous difficulties. For example, they learned the Soviet construction card system, where workers operated according to the cards, avoiding construction chaos. They promoted the Kolesov high-speed cutting method, improved cutting tools, and increased cutting efficiency. The group manufacturing screws increased production from eighty screws per shift to three hundred and fifty. Zhou Wangzhi and Gao Mingsheng, two students trained by Soviet expert Comrade Shizhuofu, solved the problems of alloy welding rods and complex installation during the trial manufacturing, which greatly contributed to the completion of the task.

    After the general line propaganda began, it further inspired the workers' enthusiasm for labor. They launched a labor competition, ensuring the completion of the task of trial manufacturing the combined coal mining machine.

    The successful trial manufacturing of the combined coal mining machine is a new victory in China's industrial production. In the near future, many combined coal mining machines will appear in the coal mines of the motherland.

    鸡西矿务局制成顿巴斯一型联合采煤机
    鸡西矿务局总机厂职工试制第一台“顿巴斯一型联合采煤机”成功。去年十二月二十日进行陆地试车，运转情况良好。
      “顿巴斯一型联合采煤机”，是苏联出产的一种世界上最杰出的采煤机器。它能直接割下矿里的煤块，不通过人力就装上链板运输机，完全代替了采煤工人笨重的体力劳动。
    一九五三年初，总机厂的职工们接受试制的任务。在试制过程中，全体工人和技术人员们积极学习了苏联先进经验，认真按照苏联的设计图纸进行作业，突破了重重困难。如学习了苏联的施工卡片制，工人按着卡片作业，避免了施工混乱现象；推广了科列索夫高速切削法，改进了刀具，提高了切削效率。制造螺丝的小组，由一班制八十个螺丝增加到三百五十个。苏联专家石卓夫同志所培养的学生周望之和高明昇两人，在试制中解决了合金焊条和复杂的安装问题，对完成任务起了很大的作用。
    总路线宣传开始以后，更鼓舞了职工们的劳动热情。他们开展了劳动竞赛，保证了完成试制联合采煤机的任务。
    联合采煤机的试制成功，是我国工业生产上的新胜利。在不久的将来，将有不少联合采煤机出现在祖国的煤矿中。
