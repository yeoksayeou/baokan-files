Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 19th: Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in a letter to General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on January 19, 1954, replied to General Thimayya's letter of January 14, 1954. The full text of Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai's reply is as follows:

General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission:

I. We have received your letter of January 14, 1954. In this letter, you reaffirmed the fact that the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" has not yet been fully implemented and that the vast majority of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war "have not been able to use the methods stipulated by the scope of authority" to exercise their right to be repatriated. You also pointed out that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission "has no right to release prisoners of war in its custody" and "has no right to 'declare their prisoner-of-war status terminated and make them civilians' because the conditions and procedures stipulated by the 'scope of authority' for making such a declaration have not been met." At the same time, you believe that "changing the status of prisoners of war by declaring them civilians or by any other means requires the implementation of explanatory work and political conferences beforehand," and that "any unilateral action by any relevant party will not be in accordance with the scope of authority." We believe that your arguments and interpretations are correct and consistent with the provisions of the "scope of authority" and its basic objectives.

II. Regarding the second point of your letter, we must point out that although the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has made great efforts, it has consistently failed to take resolute measures in the southern prisoner-of-war camps to uphold and implement the provisions of the "scope of authority" to dismantle the special agent organizations that rule the prisoners of war with violence and obstruct their repatriation. On the contrary, it recognized the special agents who murdered prisoners of war as so-called prisoner-of-war "representatives" and dealt with them, allowing the special agents to freely sabotage the explanatory work and carry out various brutal and illegal activities, while all the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had to be carried out according to the will of the special agents, so that all the key provisions of the "scope of authority" could not be implemented. This is what we find unsatisfactory. We have always believed that the serious situation on the prisoner-of-war issue was clearly created by the US side. It is clear that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has certain difficulties in carrying out its work under the threat and sabotage of the US side and its special agents. However, it is also a fact that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has failed to resolutely fulfill its solemn responsibilities, and therefore cannot but bear certain responsibilities.

III. In your letter, you stated: "Continued explanation and custody are only possible if both parties agree"; "If an agreement on the continued custody of prisoners of war and the continuation of this committee cannot be reached between or with both parties, the custody of prisoners of war must be terminated on January 23, 1954, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission itself must be dissolved on or before February 22, 1954." You also decided, as Chairman and Executor of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, to "return the un-repatriated prisoners of war to their original detaining parties just before January 23, 1954." These explanations and decisions you have put forward are contrary to the provisions of the "scope of authority" and its basic objectives, and are also inconsistent with your own arguments and interpretations cited in the first paragraph of this letter. We cannot agree with this. We believe that the statements of the Polish and Czechoslovakian members regarding your letter are correct.

IV. In accordance with the provisions of Sections 7 and 18 of the "scope of authority," the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall "exercise its legitimate duties and responsibilities without any weakening in controlling the power of prisoners of war under its temporary jurisdiction" and shall perform its tasks and work without any interference or influence. Section 24 of the "scope of authority" also stipulates that the interpretation of the "scope of authority" shall be the responsibility of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall work on the basis of a majority vote. According to these provisions, after the prisoners of war are handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, the two sides of the armistice have no right to directly handle these prisoners of war, especially cannot make unilateral final decisions on them. We have always believed that the "only feasible path" for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which is responsible for achieving the basic objectives of the "scope of authority," is to take responsibility for exercising its legitimate duties and make decisions so that the interrupted explanatory work can be continued, the ninety-day explanatory period can be made up, and waiting for the convening of a political conference. In fact, the majority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has affirmatively considered this to be legal and necessary. However, the Chairman and Executor of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission abandoned the power possessed by the Commission itself, and under the pretext of the absence of an agreement between the two sides of the armistice, refused to perform its tasks in accordance with the correct interpretation made by the Commission itself. Instead, it wanted to hand over the prisoners of war to their original detaining parties, which clearly violated the basic objectives and the substantive provisions of the "scope of authority." Because, according to the provisions of Item 51(C) of the "Armistice Agreement," all prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated have been handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for handling in accordance with the provisions of the "scope of authority." Now, in order to complete the basic objectives of the "scope of authority," the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission certainly has the right to take action based on its own correct interpretation, and the so-called agreement between the two sides of the armistice is completely unnecessary.

V. Furthermore, the solution of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its chairman being able to hand over prisoners of war to their original detaining parties cannot be derived from the "Armistice Agreement" and the "scope of authority." On the contrary, it is precisely because the US side has long implemented the consistent conspiracy of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, so that prisoners of war under the military control and accommodation of the original detaining party have had no opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated at all. Therefore, the "Armistice Agreement" and the "scope of authority" clearly stipulate that all prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated must be released from the military control and accommodation of the original detaining party and handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian armed forces for takeover and handling. It can be seen that handing over prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for takeover and handling is one of the important prerequisites of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Now, the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has decided to hand over prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation to their original detaining parties, which is to restore the status quo before the armistice and deprive the prisoners of war of the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated. In this way, the prerequisite of the Armistice Agreement is undermined, and it is beneficial to the realization of the US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. We cannot but express our firm opposition to this harmful decision of the Chairman and Executor of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

VI. You certainly know that the US military authorities have long completed the deployment to forcibly plunder Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Now they have openly stated that after these prisoners of war are handed over, they will immediately transfer them to the Syngman Rhee clique and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. At the same time, you certainly also know that the Syngman Rhee clique and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have long announced that they will "eliminate" those among these prisoners of war who are willing to be repatriated, and have set up concentration camps in South Korea and Taiwan to force them to undergo training. It can be asserted that once this group of prisoners of war is handed over to the US, Rhee, and Chiang sides by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, many of them will be persecuted and massacred, and those who do not die will be tortured for a long time and will not have the opportunity to return home and live a peaceful life. Obviously, this decision violates both the "scope of authority" and the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Conventions, and is not in line with the due justice position of a neutral country.

VII. Based on the above, we believe that your proposal to return the prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation to their original detaining parties starting from 9:00 am on January 20, 1954, is a violation of the provisions of the "Armistice Agreement" and the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." We request the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to withdraw this proposal, earnestly assume the responsibilities and obligations stipulated by the "scope of authority," and, in accordance with the correct interpretation made by the Commission itself, decide to continue to take care of the prisoners of war, resume the explanatory work, make up for the ninety-day explanatory period, and wait for the political conference to handle the prisoner-of-war issue within thirty days after its convening.

VIII. We believe that any prisoner of war has the full right to refuse to be forcibly returned to the original detaining party and request to continue to listen to the explanation. No one can deprive them of this legitimate right, especially not with force.

IX. During the period when the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission continues to take care of the prisoners of war, we will be responsible for maintaining and guaranteeing the security and order of the area around the Songgok-ri prisoner-of-war camp, and preventing and controlling any disturbances and intrusions against the prisoner-of-war detention sites. We will also guarantee the logistical support for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Indian custodial forces, and the prisoners of war.

X. We ask you to give our views the most careful consideration. We await your reply.

Kim Il-sung, Marshal, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers

    金日成元帅彭德怀将军函蒂迈雅将军
    反对把未行使遣返权利的战俘交还原拘留各方
    【新华社平壤十九日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员，在一九五四年一月十九日致函中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军，答复蒂迈雅将军一九五四年一月十四日的来信。金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员复函全文如下：中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军：
    一、我们已经收到了你一九五四年一月十四日的来信。在这封信里，你再度肯定了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”迄今未能完全实施和绝大多数朝中被俘人员“未能使用职权范围所规定的那些办法”来行使其被遣返权利的事实。你并指出：中立国遣返委员会“无权释放在其看管下的战俘”，也“无权‘宣布解除他们的战俘身份使之成为平民’，因为‘职权范围’所规定的作这种宣布的条件和程序并未实现”。同时，你又认为：“用宣布成为平民身份，或者用任何其他方式的处理来改变战俘的身份，都需要在此之前实施解释工作和政治会议的步骤”，并且“任何有关方面的任何片面行动将不符合于职权范围”。我们认为，你的这些论点和解释是正确的，是符合于“职权范围”的规定和它的基本目标的。
    二、关于你的来信第二点，我们必须指出，中立国遣返委员会虽然作了很大的努力，但在南部战俘营中一直未能采取坚决措施，维护和实施“职权范围”的规定，来打散以暴力统治战俘、阻挠战俘遣返的特务组织，相反地，却承认凶杀战俘的特务为所谓战俘“代表”，并与他们打交道，使特务得以放手破坏解释工作，进行种种残暴非法活动，而中立国遣返委员会的一切工作则不能不按照特务的意志来进行，“职权范围”的一切关键性的规定因之都未能实现。这是我们认为不能满意的。我们始终认为，战俘问题上的严重局面显然是美方一手造成的，中立国遣返委员会在美方及其特务的威胁和破坏之下进行工作显然是有一定困难的，但是中立国遣返委员会未能坚决履行其庄严的职责，也是事实，因此也不能不负有一定的责任。
    三、你在来信中声称：“只有双方同意，继续解释与看管才有可能”；“假如双方之间或与双方不能达成继续看管战俘与继续本委员会的协议，则对战俘的看管必须于一九五四年一月二十三日终止，中立国遣返委员会本身必须于一九五四年二月二十二日或在此以前解散”。你并以中立国遣返委员会主席和执行人的身份，决定“紧在一九五四年一月二十三日以前把未遣返的战俘交还他们的原拘留各方”。你所提出的这些解释和决定，都是违背“职权范围”的规定和它的基本目标的，并且与本函第一段所引的你自己的各项论点和解释也是矛盾的。我们对此不能同意。我们认为，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员关于你的来信的声明是正确的。
    四、依照“职权范围”第七款、第十八款的规定，中立国遣返委员会应不受任何削弱地“行使其合法职务和责任以控制在其临时管辖下之战俘的权力”，并应不受任何干涉和影响地执行其任务与工作。“职权范围”第二十四款又规定，对“职权范围”的解释应由中立国遣返委员会负责，中立国遣返委员会应在多数表决的基础之上工作。根据这些条款，在战俘被交到中立国遣返委员会看管之后，停战双方对这些战俘是无权直接处理的，尤其是不能对他们作片面的最后的处理。我们一贯认为，负有实现“职权范围”基本目标之责的中立国遣返委员会，其“唯一可行之路”就是负起责任来行使其合法职务，并作出决定，使中断了的解释工作得以继续，九十天的解释期限得以补足，并等候政治会议的召开。事实上，中立国遣返委员会的多数已经肯定地认为这样做是合法的和必要的。但是，中立国遣返委员会的主席和执行人却放弃了委员会本身所具有的权力，借口没有停战双方的协议，不肯按照委员会本身所作的正确解释来执行任务，反而要把战俘交还他们的原拘留各方，这显然违背了“职权范围”的基本目标和条款实质。因为根据“停战协定”第五十一款丑项的规定，所有未予直接遣返的战俘既已统交中立国遣返委员会按照“职权范围”的规定予以处理，现在为了要完成“职权范围”的基本目标，中立国遣返委员会当然有权根据自己的正确解释采取行动，而所谓停战双方的协议根本是不必要的。
    五、并且从“停战协定”和“职权范围”中根本不能得出关于中立国遣返委员会及其主席可以把战俘交还他们的原拘留各方的解决办法。相反地，正是由于美国方面长期以来实行强迫扣留战俘的一贯阴谋，使得战俘在原拘留一方的军事控制和收容之下，根本没有可能得到行使其被遣返权利的机会，所以，“停战协定”和“职权范围”才明确规定，凡未予直接遣返的战俘，必须从原拘留一方的军事控制和收容下释放出来，交给中立国遣返委员会和印度武装力量接管和处理。由此可见，将未予直接遣返的战俘交给中立国遣返委员会接管和处理是朝鲜停战协定的重要前提之一。现在中立国遣返委员会主席决定把未行使遣返权利的战俘交还他们的原拘留各方，那就是恢复停战前的原状，剥夺战俘行使其被遣返权利的机会。这样，就损害了停战协定的前提，并有利于美国方面强迫扣留战俘的阴谋的实现。我们对于中立国遣返委员会主席和执行人这种有害的决定不能不表示坚决反对。
    六、你当然知道，美国军事当局早就完成了武力劫夺朝中战俘的部署。现在他们更公开表示，在这些战俘被交还之后，将立刻把他们移交给李承晚集团和蒋介石匪帮。同时，你当然也知道，李承晚集团和蒋介石匪帮早就宣布要把这批战俘中愿意遣返的人“消灭掉”，并在南朝鲜和台湾布置了集中营来强迫他们受训。可以断言，这批战俘一旦被中立国遣返委员会交还给美、李、蒋方面，他们之中必将有很多人遭受迫害和屠杀，不死的人也将长期遭受折磨而得不到回家过和平生活的机会。很显然，这种决定既违反了“职权范围”和日内瓦公约的人道原则，也不符合于中立国应有的正义立场。
    七、基于以上所述，我们认为，你所提出的自一九五四年一月二十日九时开始把未行使遣返权利的战俘交还他们的原拘留各方的建议，是违反“停战协定”和“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定的。我们要求中立国遣返委员会主席收回这个建议，切实负起“职权范围”所规定的责任和义务，并按照委员会本身所作的正确解释，决定继续看管战俘，恢复解释工作，补足九十天的解释期限，并等待政治会议在召开后三十天内对战俘问题加以处理。
    八、我们认为，任何战俘有充分权利拒绝被强迫交还给原拘留一方，并要求继续听取解释。任何人都不能剥夺他们的这种正当权利，尤其是不能用武力来剥夺他们的这种正当权利。
    九、在中立国遣返委员会继续看管战俘的期间，我们将负责维持和保证松谷里战俘营周围区域的治安和秩序，并防止和控制任何对战俘看管地点的扰乱和侵犯行动，我们也将保证对中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队以及战俘的后勤支援。
    十、我们要求你对于我方的意见予以最慎重的考虑。我们等待着你的答复。
        朝鲜人民军最高司令官元帅　金日成
        中国人民志愿军司令员　彭德怀
                      一九五四年一月十九日
