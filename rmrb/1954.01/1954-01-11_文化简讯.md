The theater has a hall, lounge, stage, music pool, dressing and changing rooms, a ticket office for both sunny and rainy days, a public telephone room, a audience service area, a food retail area, as well as heating, ventilation and indirect lighting equipment.
    The auditorium can accommodate 1,300 people. The ceiling is equipped with sound-absorbing devices, so that audiences sitting in the last row upstairs can also hear the slight sounds on the stage. The proscenium stage is magnificent, equipped with 80,000 lights. Footlights are embedded on the front edge of the stage. If the entire stage is used for a chorus of 700 people, the audience can still see it clearly.
