The Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, Marshal Kim Il-sung, and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, General Peng Dehuai, sent a letter to General Thimayya on January 7th, regarding the interim report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) and its related attachments, as well as General Thimayya's letter of January 2nd and the attached memorandum. They firmly maintained that the ninety-day explanation period for the Korean prisoners of war (POWs) should be replenished, and the issue of POWs who had not exercised their right to repatriation should be handled by the political conference within thirty days of its convocation. The claims insisted upon by Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai are fully in line with the important provisions and basic objectives of the “Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission,” and are also the only reasonable way to change the current serious situation in Korea and ensure the smooth resolution of the POW issue.

The facts stated in the interim report submitted by the NNRC to the Korean armistice signatories powerfully demonstrate that the explanation work for our side's POWs in Korea has consistently been severely sabotaged by the U.S. side. Therefore, our side did not receive the ninety-day explanation period stipulated in the “Terms of Reference of the NNRC,” but was only able to conduct ten days of explanation work for a very small number of POWs. At the same time, the U.S. government deliberately created an unreasonable excuse to interrupt the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference, preventing the political conference from being convened quickly to handle the POW issue. In this way, the implementation of most of the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" was undermined, and the legitimate duties of the Commission itself and the basic objectives of the "Terms of Reference" were not fulfilled.

It is well known that the U.S. side implemented a policy of espionage and terror to undermine the POW explanation work and the implementation of the "Terms of Reference." The interim report of the NNRC pointed out: "The prisoners of war delivered to the Committee by the United Nations Command are tightly organized," and the "headquarters" of this espionage organization "is located in Seoul and is controlled by the Provost Marshal General of the Republic of Korea." "This headquarters is connected to four branch organizations that control the six POW compounds. The branch organizations in turn control the camp organizations in all fifty-five compounds. An effective communication system operates between these three levels of organization, with the United Nations Command's 64th Field Hospital forming the most important link in this communication system." This U.S., Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek espionage organization used violence against POWs in the POW camps, placing them "under force or threat of force." Even those few POWs who had heard explanations were subjected to "force or threat of force from the POW camp organization and its leaders, and who are closely connected to the POW camp organization and its leaders." The U.S. espionage's reign of terror and violence against the POWs not only prevented the POWs from "enjoying freedom to seek repatriation when they were in the compounds," but also, through its control of the POW camps, systematically undermined the explanation work and prevented the POWs from exercising their right to repatriation. The interim report of the NNRC pointed out on several occasions that the five forced interruptions of our explanation work were all caused by the illegal actions of U.S. espionage agents who prevented POWs from listening to explanations or refused to separate POWs who had heard explanations from those who had not. The criminal activities of these U.S., Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek espionage agents in undermining the explanation work were carried out entirely under the direction of the U.S. side. The NNRC "also noted that the views of the United Nations Command coincided with the views held by the POW ‘representatives,’ who continued to express hostility to the explanations." And these representatives are the embodiment of espionage agents.

However, in the face of this ironclad fact, the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, Hull, shamelessly attempted to deceive the world, denying the fact that he used the espionage forces of the U.S., Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek to usurp the control of the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces, thereby undermining our explanation work and preventing our captured personnel from applying for repatriation. At the same time, he continued to arbitrarily distort the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," stubbornly insisted that "the explanation work should be terminated on December 23, 1953," and brazenly stated that the U.S. side would seize more than 22,000 Korean and Chinese captured personnel who had not received ninety days of explanation and had not been processed by the political conference by January 23 of this year. This extremely vile and rogue behavior of the U.S. side will surely arouse great anger from peace-loving people and be severely condemned.

The "Terms of Reference" that the U.S. side itself signed can absolutely not serve as a legal cover for the U.S. side's criminal behavior of depriving POWs of their right to listen to explanations and forcibly detaining our captured personnel. The "Terms of Reference" clearly stipulated the basic goal of establishing the NNRC, which is to ensure that all POWs have the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation. In order to guarantee this right, the "Terms of Reference" stipulated that ninety days of explanation work should be conducted for all POWs, and then the POWs who have not applied for repatriation should be handed over to the political conference for processing within thirty days. Now, since the U.S. side has thoroughly undermined these mandatory and key measures of the "Terms of Reference" and all the legal rights of the POWs have been wantonly deprived, then the current issue should of course absolutely not be to terminate the explanation, but to ensure that the explanation work continues in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and the "Working Rules"; it should not be to so-called release the POWs as civilians, but to ensure that the POWs who have not applied for repatriation are handled by the political conference after the ninety-day period has been replenished. Isn't this a very simple and legitimate principle?

In this regard, the interim report of the NNRC, which described the crimes of the U.S. side and its espionage organizations in obstructing and undermining the explanation work, is basically factual and relatively fair. Based on these irrefutable facts, the NNRC definitely believes that the explanation work should be continued and insists that the POW issue "be given serious consideration in a manner consistent with the basic objectives embodied in the 'Terms of Reference'," which is completely reasonable and necessary. As for the Swedish and Swiss members' attempts in their individual reports to absolve the U.S. side of the major responsibility for undermining the explanation work and to prevent the NNRC from seriously considering the realization of the basic objectives of the "Terms of Reference," that is detrimental to the neutral status of the Swedish and Swiss members and is completely unacceptable to the Korean and Chinese sides.

The inescapable and sacred responsibility currently facing the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces is to continue to fulfill their unfinished legitimate duties, insist on their assertion that the explanation work should be continued, replenish the ninety-day explanation period, and then continue to take care of the POWs who have not applied for repatriation, to be discussed and processed by the political conference within thirty days of its convocation. At the same time, in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces, when taking these measures, should implement the isolation of POWs, dismantle U.S. espionage organizations, and eliminate all espionage agents, in order to ensure that the restored explanation work is no longer undermined and that the desire of our captured personnel to demand repatriation is no longer prevented by any force or threat of force. Only in this way can the basic objectives of the "Terms of Reference" be realized.

The POW issue must be resolved and handled in accordance with the "Terms of Reference," which is a major issue related to the implementation of the armistice agreement and related to peace in Korea and the world. Therefore, fair international public opinion unanimously condemns the U.S. side's adventurous steps to forcibly detain POWs and supports the just struggle of the Korean and Chinese sides to uphold the "Terms of Reference." In his speech to the Indian People's Assembly on December 23, 1953, Indian Prime Minister Nehru also believed that the explanation period for POWs in Korea should be extended, while the U.S. side's insistence that it could not be extended "is a very rigid, literal, and rather narrow interpretation." Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai solemnly pointed out: Only by adhering to the impartial position of neutral countries can the NNRC gain the heartfelt support of all just people in the world, and only then will it be possible for the U.S. side to retreat from its unreasonable position. We believe that this is the only correct path that the NNRC should follow today.

### “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定必须全部实施

    “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定必须全部实施
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，于一月七日就中立国遣返委员会临时报告及其有关附件以及中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军一月二日的来信和附来的备忘录，致函蒂迈雅将军，坚决主张朝鲜战俘解释工作的九十天的解释期限应予补足，尚未行使其被遣返权利的战俘问题应交由政治会议在召开后的三十天内加以处理。金日成元帅和彭德怀将军所坚持的这种主张，完全符合于“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的各项重要规定及其基本目标，并且也是改变目前朝鲜严重局势，使战俘问题得到顺利解决的唯一合理途径。
    中立国遣返委员会提交朝鲜停战缔约双方的临时报告所陈述的事实，有力地证明了朝鲜我方战俘解释工作一直就遭到美方的严重破坏，因此我方没有得到“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所规定的九十天的解释日期，而只能向极少数的战俘进行了十天的解释工作。同时，美国政府又蓄意制造一个毫无道理的借口中断了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，使政治会议不能迅速召开来处理战俘问题。这样，“职权范围”大部分规定的实施就遭受了破坏，委员会本身的合法职务及“职权范围”的基本目标因之都没有完成。
    美方执行特务恐怖政策破坏战俘解释工作及“职权范围”的实施是众所周知的。中立国遣返委员会临时报告指出：“联合国军送交本委员会看管的战俘是有紧密组织的”，这种特务组织的“总部地点在汉城，受大韩民国宪兵总司令官的控制。”“这一总部与控制六个战俘围场的四个分支组织是相联系的。分支组织则控制着所有五十五个营场中的营场组织。在这三层组织之间有一个有效的通讯系统在工作，联合国军第六十四野战医院在这一通讯系统中构成了最重要的一环。”而这种美、李、蒋特务组织，对战俘营中的战俘施用了暴力行为，使他们“处于武力或武力威胁之下”，甚至那些少数听过解释的战俘也受到“来自战俘营组织与其领导的，并与战俘营组织与其领导有密切联系的武力或武力威胁”。美方特务对战俘的恐怖统治和暴力行为，不但使战俘“当其在营场中时均未享有寻求遣返的自由”，并且还以其对战俘营的统治，有计划地破坏解释工作，阻止战俘行使其被遣返权利。中立国遣返委员会临时报告中曾分别指出，我方解释工作五次被迫中断，都是由于美方特务阻止战俘听取解释或拒绝隔离已听解释和未听解释的战俘的非法行为所造成的。美、李、蒋特务这种破坏解释工作的罪恶活动，完全是在美方的指使之下进行的。中立国遣返委员会“并注意到联合国军的意见与战俘‘代表’所持的意见相合，这些战俘‘代表’继续对进行解释表示敌意”。而这些代表就是特务的化身。
    但是，在这铁一般的事实面前，联合国军总司令赫尔居然还厚颜无耻地企图一手掩尽天下耳目，否认其利用美、李、蒋特务势力侵夺中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队的控制权力、从而破坏我方解释工作，阻止我方被俘人员申请遣返的事实。同时，他并继续任意曲解“职权范围”的规定，横蛮坚持“解释工作应在一九五三年十二月二十三日截止”，悍然表示美方将在今年一月二十三日劫夺未能听取九十天解释又未经政治会议处理的两万二千余名朝中被俘人员。美方这种极端卑劣的无赖行为，定将引起爱好和平人民的极大愤怒并受到严厉的谴责。
    美方自己签了字的“职权范围”，是绝对不可能作为美方剥夺战俘听取解释权利、强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶行为的合法外衣的。“职权范围”开宗明义地规定了成立中立国遣返委员会的基本目标，就是保证一切战俘有机会行使其被遣返权利，而为了保证这种权利，“职权范围”又规定对一切战俘进行九十天的解释工作，然后将尚未申请遣返的战俘交由政治会议在三十天内加以处理。现在，既然美方彻底地破坏了“职权范围”的这些强制性的关键措施，一切战俘的合法权利横遭剥夺，那么，目前的问题就当然绝对不应是终止解释，而是保证解释工作按照“职权范围”和“工作细则”继续进行；不应是所谓释放战俘为平民，而是在九十天期限补足之后使尚未申请遣返的战俘得到政治会议的处理。这难道不是非常浅显而正当的道理吗？
    在这方面，中立国遣返委员会临时报告中，对美方及其特务组织阻挠破坏解释工作的罪行的叙述，是基本上符合事实的，比较公正的。根据这种不容辩驳的事实，中立国遣返委员会肯定地认为解释工作应予继续，主张必须“以符合于‘职权范围’中所体现的基本目标的态度”对战俘问题“予以认真的考虑”，是完全合理和必要的。至于瑞典、瑞士委员在个别报告中企图解脱美方破坏解释工作的重大责任，使中立国遣返委员会不去认真考虑实现“职权范围”的基本目标，那是有损于瑞典、瑞士委员的中立身份而为朝中方面所完全不能接受的。
    目前摆在中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队面前的不可推卸的神圣职责，就是继续履行其尚未完成的合法职务，坚持其关于解释工作应予继续的主张，补足九十天的解释期限，然后继续看管尚未申请遣返的战俘，由政治会议在召开后的三十天内加以讨论处理。同时，为了避免重蹈过去的覆辙，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在采取这些措施时，应实行隔离战俘，打散美方特务组织，清除一切特务分子，以保证恢复后的我方解释工作不再受到破坏，保证我方被俘人员要求遣返的愿望不再受到任何武力和武力威胁的阻止。只有这样，“职权范围”的基本目标，才能实现。
    战俘问题必须按照“职权范围”加以解决和处理，这是关系到停战协定实施、关系到朝鲜和世界和平的重大问题。因此，国际公正舆论都一致谴责美方强迫扣留战俘的冒险步骤，支持朝中方面维护
  “职权范围”的正义斗争。印度总理尼赫鲁于一九五三年十二月二十三日在印度人民院发表的演说中，也认为在朝鲜对战俘的解释期限应予延长，而美方坚持不能延长的意见，“就是一种非常呆板的、死扣条文的和颇为狭隘的解释。”金日成元帅和彭德怀将军严正指出：中立国遣返委员会只有坚持中立国的公正立场，才能得到全世界正义人类的衷心支持，亦才有可能使美方自其蛮横无理的立场退缩。我们认为这是中立国遣返委员会今天应当遵循的唯一正当道路。
