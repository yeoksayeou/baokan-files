Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 21st: The British weekly "World News" (formerly "World News and Views") reported: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party held a meeting on January 9th.

    The meeting passed a resolution on the Berlin Four-Power Conference. The resolution pointed out that the convening of the Four-Power Conference is a further victory for the peace movement and the firm demands of the people of all countries for peace following the Korean armistice.

    The resolution continued: "The people of the world demand that this conference prepare the ground for a once-and-for-all solution to European problems on the basis of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, and pave the way for a five-power conference to ease international tensions, ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, and reduce armaments.

    "We cannot close our eyes to the fact that representatives of the American war camp, and their supporters in the British and West German Adenauer governments, are desperately trying to undermine this conference, and to accelerate the reconstruction of German militarism, making it the dominant partner in a Western European aggressive war alliance.

    "Now more than ever, it is necessary to launch the broadest possible movement to defeat this war plan, and to present the people's demands for peace to the Berlin Conference. Let every labor organization, trade union organization, and factory demand of members of parliament and the Foreign Secretary: Do not rearm German militarism and Nazism! Let the Berlin Conference replace the current military occupation and divided Germany with a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany! Strive for a five-power conference to eliminate the threat of a third world war, and open a new era of cooperation and peace!"

    The meeting also decided to launch a campaign to recruit new members during the period up to the Party Congress to be held at Easter, and recommended that, after consultation with fraternal parties in the Commonwealth countries, a meeting be held in London from April 21st to 24th with representatives of these parties.
   
    Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: TASS, London: On the 19th, the British National Women's Congress issued a statement on the Four Foreign Ministers Conference opening in Berlin on the 25th. The statement said: "The National Women's Congress hopes that the meeting will not break down abruptly, and hopes that the parties involved in the meeting will approach it with a spirit of reconciliation and a sincere desire to reach agreement on outstanding issues. ... The National Women's Congress calls on all women in Britain and overseas to pay constant attention to the developments of the Berlin Conference, and to exert pressure on their governments to force them to continue negotiations until world peace and the prosperity that peace can bring are guaranteed."

    英共执委会通过关于四外长会议的决议
    英国全国妇女大会发表声明希望柏林会议达成协议
   【新华社柏林二十一日电】英国“世界新闻”周刊（以前叫作“世界新闻评论”）报道：英国共产党执行委员会于一月九日举行会议。
    会上通过了关于柏林四国会议的决议。决议指出，四国会议的召开是和平运动以及各国人民对和平的坚决要求继朝鲜停战以后的进一步胜利。
    决议接着说：“全世界人民要求这次会议在统一、和平和民主的德国的基础上，为一劳永逸地解决欧洲问题作好准备，并且为举行五大国会议来缓和国际紧张局势、为禁止原子弹与氢弹以及裁减军备铺平道路。
      “我们不能闭起眼睛来，看不见美国的战争阵营的代表以及他们在英国与西德阿登纳政府中的支持者拚命想破坏这个会议，想加速重建德国军国主义，使它成为西欧侵略战争联盟中的支配一切的伙伴。
    “现在比过去任何时候都有必要发动最广泛的运动来击败这个战争计划，并且向柏林会议提出人民对和平的要求。让每一个劳工组织、工会组织和工厂向议员与外交大臣要求：不要重新武装德国军国主义与纳粹主义。让柏林会议以统一、和平和民主的德国来代替目前的军事占领与分裂的德国！争取举行五大国会议来消除第三次世界大战的威胁，并且开辟合作与和平的新纪元！”
    会议还决定在到复活节举行党代表大会为止的这一个时期内展开吸收新党员的运动，并且建议在和英联邦各国兄弟党磋商后，于四月二十一日到二十四日在伦敦和这些党的代表举行会议。
   【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：十九日，英国全国妇女大会就二十五日在柏林开幕的四国外长会议发表声明。声明中说：“全国妇女大会希望会议不会突然破裂，并希望参加会议的有关方面都抱着一种和解的心情和就悬而未决的问题达成协议的真诚愿望。……全国妇女大会要求英国和海外所有的妇女不断地注意柏林会议的发展情况，并对她们的政府施以压力，迫使它们继续谈判，直到世界和平以及和平可能带来的繁荣得到保证时为止。”
