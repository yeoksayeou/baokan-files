The Bright Road for Small Handicraft Producers
    ——A Record of the Datong Ironware Production Cooperative's Transition from Dispersed Handicrafts to Semi-Mechanization
    Yang Sen, Ma Liang
    The Datong Ironware Production Cooperative of Datong City, which was awarded the title of "First-Class Model for Transition to Semi-Mechanization" at the Shanxi Provincial Industrial Labor Model Representative Conference, has gradually grown and expanded under the cultivation and support of the People's Government and the provincial and municipal cooperatives, following the direction of serving factories and mines, serving the countryside, and serving the country's production and construction and the needs of the people. This cooperative presents a vigorous new atmosphere. This new atmosphere fully demonstrates the superiority of mutual assistance and cooperation and points out the correct direction for the development of handicraftsmen.
    “Three Ups and Three Downs”
    In the process of development, the Datong Ironware Production Cooperative also experienced many twists and turns and encountered many difficulties. In the first three years of its establishment, it collapsed two or three times in a row and was reorganized several times. Therefore, many people in Datong City said that this cooperative was a "three ups and three downs" cooperative. Originally, this cooperative was organized under the leadership of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative not long after the liberation of Datong in 1949. At that time, due to the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative's unclear guiding principles for leading the production cooperative and the unsound organizational system, it took many detours. Among the 304 members, 136 did not directly participate in production, and even some merchants and small handicraft capitalists participated, still enjoying unearned income and living by exploitation. In terms of management methods, production was decentralized to the homes of individual members, based on the furnace as a unit. The cooperative was only responsible for supplying raw materials and purchasing and selling finished products, thus forming a state of self-circulation of production and sales. In addition, the cooperative only one-sidedly considered the immediate interests of the members themselves and lacked education on overall and long-term interests, as well as failing to establish a strict inspection system for product specifications and quality. Therefore, most members kept good and fast-selling goods for themselves and pushed inferior and slow-selling goods to the cooperative. As a result, the cooperative ended because it had too much stock of slow-selling and inferior goods, its funds could not circulate, and it could not maintain itself.
    In the spring of 1950, under the call of "Great Production," the cooperative, after research, decided to adopt a centralized management method and reorganize for production. However, at that time, the principle of steady development was not adopted, and in a few days, it organized 80 furnaces, a foundry, and a carpentry team, all concentrated in one place for production. After being organized, the cooperative, on the one hand, did not educate and transform the spontaneous capitalist thinking of the small handicraftsmen, and on the other hand, did not properly solve the problems of wages and quality, which again laid the roots for the cooperative's inability to consolidate. In terms of wages, the foundry and carpentry teams were on a contract wage system, and the furnaces were on a piece-rate wage system. While implementing these two wage systems, there was no strict product specification quality inspection system and raw material quota system established, resulting in low work efficiency and very serious phenomena of shoddy work and waste of raw materials. The work efficiency of the foundry was less than half of that of private factories, and the scrap rate reached 40%, and the waste of coking coal reached 32%. The carpentry team produced 2,000 boxes for the egg product company, all of which were substandard. There was also exploitation between furnace owners, workers, and apprentices in the furnaces, because the furnace owners possessed the tools and could dismiss apprentices and workers at will, so the workers' morale was low and their enthusiasm for production could not be brought into play. In order to earn more piece-rate wages, many furnaces only sought quantity and did not care about quality. As a result, at the end of the year, the accumulated funds of defective and inferior products amounted to more than 12 million yuan, and the remaining scrap iron could be converted into more than 30 million yuan. At the same time, due to the lack of management knowledge of the cooperative's cadres, they blindly signed contracts with the outside world, and the fines for failing to complete the contracts on time reached 7 million yuan. As a result, the share capital was lost, forcing the cooperative to collapse.
    In the autumn of 1951, the Datong Machine Factory entrusted the cooperative to produce plow parts, which enabled the cooperative to reorganize again. The Cooperative of the former Chahar Province sent a working group to personally help the society rectify its affairs, and the Municipal Cooperative also assigned cadres to eliminate the furnace owners' exploitation of ordinary workers. After that, the working group of the Provincial and Municipal Cooperatives led them to reorganize the organization, clean up the internal affairs, implement the articles of association, and re-form the council through democratic elections. Important issues were discussed and decided by the council, and relevant business guidelines were discussed by the general meeting of members. In this way, the cooperative adopted democratic management and the working methods of following the mass line, which gave it a clear direction in its development. In order to prevent the phenomenon of shoddy manufacturing and waste of raw materials and man-hours from continuing to occur, the cooperative, on the one hand, thoroughly adjusted the original unreasonable wages, and implemented monthly salaries, piece-rate or piece-rate scoring and other wage systems according to the nature of the work, the level of technology, and the quality of labor attitude; on the other hand, it also established a strict four-fixed system of fixed personnel, fixed quantity, fixed quality, and fixed materials and a work assessment system. In order to ensure the true realization of these systems, the members also elected a production competition committee and a quality inspection committee to establish a normal order in their work. From then on, the Datong Ironware Production Cooperative had a thriving scene.
    The First Step Towards Realizing the Ideal
    The members of the cooperative, especially the majority of the young members, have continuously improved their political awareness under the cultivation of the Party and the government. Whenever they mentioned their own and the cooperative's future, they unanimously expressed that in order to adapt to the needs of national production and construction and overcome the decentralization and backwardness of small handicraftsmen, they could only gradually implement semi-mechanized production, until all mechanized production. In order to achieve this common goal, the members gave full play to their enthusiasm in production. In 1952, when the cooperative built the factory, the members' voluntary participation in voluntary labor alone saved the cooperative more than 14 million yuan. Under the unanimous efforts of all members, by May 1952, the cooperative had accumulated 170 million yuan in construction funds and surplus; at the same time, it also had certain conditions in terms of material sources, product sales, and business relationships. At this time, the members proposed to install machines to implement semi-mechanized production. This request was finally realized in June 1952 with the support of the Provincial Cooperative. In addition to installing an 8-foot lathe and a 6-foot lathe, they also installed planers, drilling machines, grinders, electric power, gas welding, and even foundry equipment.
    The realization of semi-mechanization further encouraged the members' enthusiasm for labor. In order to further improve product quality and efficiency, increase product types, and open up new roads for the cooperative, the members made great efforts to study and improve production technology, use their brains, and find tricks. The furnace team created a production flow operation method, changing from individual production to collective production. For example, when making iron spoons, the three furnaces were divided into three processes: red furnace, ignition, and cold work, saving two people and increasing work efficiency by 13%. Another example is the match knife used by the match factory, which could not be manufactured at all in the past. Now, with the active research of member Hao Zhankui, it has finally been successfully trial-produced, and the quality is good.
    The Superiority of Being Organized
    Before joining the cooperative, the members of the Datong Ironware Production Cooperative were most worried about the difficulty of sales in the off-season, the lack of capital, and the inability to produce. Therefore, at that time, they had to sell their products to private merchants at low prices in the off-season, or borrow money from usurers, otherwise they would have to take the path of unemployment. Since joining the cooperative, this threat has disappeared. Because the cooperative has the share capital collected by everyone and the accumulation over the years, the government's loan support, the processing orders from state-owned factories and mines, and business relationships in various aspects, it has completely gotten rid of the exploitation of private merchants and usurers, and completely changed the abnormal production state of small handicraftsmen, which was intermittent, loose, and tight due to lack of funds for decentralized production.
    After joining the cooperative, things that were unimaginable in the past can now be done. Young workers Chang Rong, Li Fuhan, etc., used to often think about when they could become machine operators when they were blacksmithing on the furnace. Today, they have realized this beautiful wish and learned the skills of operating machines. Due to the development of mutual assistance and cooperation, the installation of new machines, and the continuous improvement of production technology, products that could not be manufactured in the past can now be manufactured, and the most difficult jobs in the past are now easier. Therefore, the Datong Ironware Production Cooperative has not only gradually improved its production efficiency and product quality, but also greatly increased its product types. Now, under the guiding principle of serving factories and mines and serving the countryside, the cooperative's production varieties have reached more than 100 kinds, including joints and screws on drilling machines, accessories on general machines, hooks, shovels, and stoves used by the masses daily, as well as shovels, saws, axes, sickles, and new agricultural tools such as new-style plows and seed mixing devices, which are most popular among farmers. Due to the increase in product varieties and the improvement of product quality, the cooperative's business scope has gradually expanded. From January to October 1953, it signed 23 contracts with the outside world, with a value of 430 million yuan.
    With the continuous improvement of production efficiency, the members' material and cultural life has also been significantly improved. In 1953, the average monthly income per person was 350,000 yuan, and the highest wage for technicians was 560,000 yuan, which was 55.56% to 100% higher than the wages of workers in private factories. Since the cooperative's management has become regularized, the old worker Xu Yi has been able to earn an average of 500,000 yuan per month. Therefore, his family's life has been greatly improved. Two children from a family that has been blacksmiths for four generations are now in school.
    However, all the members of the cooperative are not satisfied with this. In order to realize all mechanized production and prepare for the country's industrialization, they have recently formed a technical research association and a business research association, and more than 80% of the young people have participated in spare-time schools, and more than 90% of the workers have participated in political studies in order to continuously improve their political and cultural level and production technology and create greater achievements.

    小手工业生产者的光明道路
    ——记由分散的手工业走向半机械化的大同铁业生产合作社
    杨森  马良
    在山西省工业劳动模范代表大会上，荣获“走向半机械化一等模范”称号的大同市铁业生产合作社，是在人民政府和省、市合作社培养扶植下，循着面向工矿、面向农村、服务于国家生产建设和人民需要的方向，逐渐成长壮大起来的。这个合作社呈现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。这种新气象，充分显示出互助合作的优越性，给手工业者指出了正确的发展方向。
    “三起三落”
    大同市铁业生产合作社在发展过程中，也曾经过许多波折，遇到过很多困难。在开始成立的头三年里，就一连垮了两三次，重新组织了好几回，因此，大同市有许多人都说这个社是“三起三落”的合作社。原来，这个合作社是一九四九年大同解放后不久，在市供销社的领导下组织起来的。当时由于市供销社对领导生产社的方针不够明确，组织制度不健全，走过了不少弯路。三百零四个社员中，就有一百三十六人不直接参加生产，甚至还有些商人和小手工业的资方也参加进来，他们依然不劳而获，靠着剥削吃饭。在经营方法上，是以烘炉为单位，分散在各个社员家中生产，只是由合作社负责供给原料，收购推销成品，因此形成了产销自流状态。再加上合作社只是片面地从社员本身眼前的利益出发，缺乏进行整体与长远利益的教育，以及在产品规格质量上未严格建立验收制度，所以大部分社员把好货、热销货留下自己卖，把劣货、冷货推给合作社。结果，合作社因为冷货、劣货积压太多，资金周转不灵，无法维持而结束了。
    一九五零年春，在“大生产”的号召下，合作社经过研究，决议采取集中经营的方法，重新组织起来生产。但当时没有采取稳步发展的方针，不几天就组织起烘炉八十盘，翻砂厂一个、木工组一个、集中在一块儿生产。在组织起来之后，合作社一则没有对小手工业者的资本主义自发思想进行教育改造，二则没有适当的解决工资问题与质量问题，这就又给合作社扎下了不能巩固的病根子。在工资方面，翻砂和木工是包干工资制，烘炉是计件工资制。而在实行这两种工资制度的同时，也没有建立严格的产品规格质量验收制度和原料定额等制度，以致工作效率不高，粗制滥造、浪费原料的现象非常严重。翻砂厂的工作效率还不及私营工厂的一半，而废品率竟达百分之四十，焦煤浪费达百分之三十二。木工组给蛋品公司承制了两千个箱子，全部不合规格。烘炉上的炉主、伙计与徒工之间还有剥削，因为炉主占有工具，可以随便解雇徒工和伙计，因而工人们生产情绪低落，生产积极性不能发挥；不少烘炉为了多拿计件工资，只求数量、不管质量，结果到年底结账，废品、劣品积压资金一千二百余万元，残存的废铁就可折款三千多万元。同时，由于合作社的干部缺乏经营管理知识，盲目向外签订合同，因到期完不成合同而屡次受罚款项即达七百万元。结果，股金赔完了，使合作社不得不走向垮台。
      一九五一年秋，大同机器厂委托合作社承制步犁配件，又使合作社重新组织起来。原察哈尔省合作社派工作组亲自帮助该社整顿社务，市合作社也给配备了干部，消灭了炉主对一般工人的剥削制度。此后省市合作社工作组领导他们整顿了组织，清理了内部，贯彻了社章，通过民主选举，重新组成了理事委员会，一些重要的问题都经过理事会研究决定，有关业务方针问题，都经过社员大会讨论。这样，合作社由于采取了民主管理和走群众路线的工作方法，使其发展上有了明确的方向。为了防止粗制滥造和浪费原料、工时的现象继续发生，合作社一方面将原来不合理的工资彻底进行了调整，按照工作性质、技术高低与劳动态度的好坏，分别实行了月薪、计件或计件评分等工资制；另一方面，还建立了严格的定员、定量、定质、定料的四定制度与工作考核制度。为了保证这些制度的真正实现，社员们并选出了生产竞赛委员会和质量检查委员会，使工作上树立了正常秩序。从此大同市铁业生产社才有了欣欣向荣的景象。
      实现了理想的第一步
    合作社的社员们特别是大部分青年社员们，在党和政府的培养下，政治觉悟不断提高。他们一提到自己和合作社的前途时，就不约而同的表示：要想适应国家生产建设需要，克服小手工业者的分散性、落后性，就只有逐步实行半机械化生产，直到全部机械化生产。为了达到这个共同的目的，社员们在生产中高度发挥了积极性。一九五二年合作社在修建厂坊时，仅社员们自动参加义务劳动一项，即为合作社节约一千四百余万元。在全体社员们的一致努力下，到一九五二年五月，合作社就积累了建设基金和盈余一亿七千万元；同时在材料来源、产品销路、业务关系等方面也都具备了一定的条件。这时，社员们就提出了要安装机器实行半机械化生产的要求。这一要求，在省合作社的扶植下，终于一九五二年的六月实现了。他们除安装了一部八呎车床，一部六呎车床外，并安上了刨床、钻床、砂轮、电动力，气焊以至翻砂等机器设备。
    半机械化的实现，更加鼓舞了社员们的劳动热情，为了进一步把产品质量、效率提高，增加产品种类，给合作社开辟新的道路，社员们都以极大的努力，研究改进生产技术、开动脑筋、寻找窍门。烘炉组创造了生产流水作业法，由各自生产改为集体生产，如打制铁勺时，将三盘炉分为红炉、接火、冷工三道工序，节省了两个人，还提高工作效率百分之十三。再如火柴厂使用的火柴刀，过去根本无法制造，现在在社员郝占魁的积极钻研下，终于试制成功，并且质量良好。
      组织起来的优越性
    大同市铁业生产合作社的社员们，在未参加合作社以前，最发愁的一件事就是淡季销路困难、本钱缺乏、无力生产。所以，那时候他们一到淡季，就不得不把产品低价出售给私商，或者就向高利贷者贷款，不然就只好走失业的途径。自从参加了合作社，这种威胁就没有了。因为合作社有大伙集中起来的股金和历年来的积累，有政府的贷款扶植，有国营厂矿加工订货和各方面的业务关系，就完全摆脱了私商和高利贷者的盘剥，彻底改变了小手工业者因分散生产缺乏资金而时断时续时松时紧不正常的生产状态。
    参加了合作社后，过去想不到的事情，今天也都能办到了。青年工人常荣、李福汉等，以前在烘炉上打铁的时候，时常想着什么时候才能当一个开机器的工人，今天他们已经实现了这个美好的愿望，学会了操纵机器的本领。由于互助合作的发展，新机器的安装和生产技术的不断改进，以往不能制造的产品现在可以制造了，以往最费劲的活儿如今也省劲了。因而，大同市铁业生产合作社不仅生产效率和产品质量逐步提高，产品种类也大大的增加了。现在这个合作社在面向工矿，面向农村的方针下，生产品种已达一百余种，有钻探机上的接头、螺丝，有一般机器上的配件，有群众日常使用的钩、铲、炉子，也有锹、锯、斧、镰，和最受农民欢迎的新式步犁和拌种器等新式农具。由于产品品种的增多，产品质量的提高，合作社的业务范围日渐扩大，一九五三年一月份至十月份就向外签订二十三件合同，价值即达四亿三千万元。
    随着生产效率的不断提高，社员们的物质文化生活也就获得了显著的改善。一九五三年的工资每人每月平均收入三十五万元，技工最高的工资达五十六万元，比私营工厂工人的工资提高了百分之五十五点五六到百分之一百。老工人许义自从合作社的经营走上正规以后，每月平均能收入工资五十万元。因此，他家的生活大大改善了。当了四辈子铁匠的家庭，如今也有两个孩子进了学校。
    但是合作社的全体社员们，并不因此而满足，他们为了要实现全部机械化生产，为国家工业化做好准备，新近又组成了技术研究会和业务研究会，并有百分之八十以上的青年，参加了业余学校，百分之九十以上的工人参加了政治学习，以便不断的提高自己的政治文化水平和生产技术，创造出更大的成绩。
