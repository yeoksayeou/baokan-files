    A Call for Peace
    Han Xueye, Korea
    During my attendance at the World Peace Council meeting held in Vienna in November 1953, I deeply felt the joy expressed by the Chinese and Soviet peoples from the bottom of their hearts regarding the Korean armistice. I deeply felt their noble spirit of treating the pain of the Korean people as their own and the joy of the Korean people as their own.
  Upon arriving in China, the first thing people talked about was: "How is Pyongyang's construction going? How many new houses have been built?" These inquiries showed the Chinese people's extreme concern for the recovery and construction of Korea and also showed the Chinese people's conviction that in Korea, which had been ravaged by war, in Korea where cities and villages had been turned into ruins, a beautiful life would surely be built.
    When I arrived in the Soviet Union, in Budapest, or in Vienna, people also first asked about the post-war recovery and construction in Korea. They fully believed that the Korean people, who had displayed unparalleled courage in the Fatherland Liberation War, would definitely create a better life after the war.
    During this Peace Council meeting, I saw reports about the signing of the agreement on economic and cultural cooperation between China and Korea. Many representatives sitting with me were calculating the amount of China's aid to Korea with pencils. However, what we are more grateful for is the noble spirit shown by the Chinese people in their assistance. This spirit is historic. I remember that back when Marshal Kim Il-sung was conducting anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in Northeast China, a Chinese comrade was once stripped naked by the Japanese invaders for protecting the guerrillas, tied up and tortured for several hours, but he never revealed the location of the guerrillas. Because of his steadfastness, the guerrillas were able to safely return to their base. From this perspective, today's Luo Shengjiao is by no means accidental.
    We, the Korean people, have always been known for our indomitable spirit. I am reminded of an event that happened in October 1950, when the war was at its most difficult. One night, Marshal Kim Il-sung encountered a group marching and singing songs on the road. So Marshal Kim Il-sung stopped the car and asked:
    "Where is this group coming from?"
    The group replied: "It is said that Korea is three thousand miles long, but we have walked four thousand miles!"
    Because it was dark, the group did not know who was asking. But Marshal Kim Il-sung had already realized that this was a group of children. So he asked:
    "Where are you children going?"
    "We are the Young Pioneers from Sangju, North Gyeongsang Province, and we want to see General Kim Il-sung."
    "Why?"
    "We are looking for General Kim Il-sung to ask for military uniforms and guns. We want to join the army and liberate our hometown."
    The spirit and courage of these children are exactly the same as those of the Korean youth and the Korean People's Army. It is precisely because of this that the Korean people were able to achieve victory in the unprecedentedly brutal war.
    The Korean people bravely fought through the war, and after the armistice, they began to work hard to rebuild their country. After the armistice, a foreign delegation visited a factory and asked the workers:
    "What do you need most in terms of living now? Please tell us, and our people will send it to you."
    The workers replied firmly: "We don't need anything else, we need machines the most! We would be ashamed to accept aid without working!"
    It is this spirit that has given the workers endless wisdom and strength, allowing chemical plants and electric furnaces to be repaired, and allowing dilapidated locomotives to run again.
    Not long ago, when the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea visited a factory with many gifts, the workers were moved and said:
      "We will definitely revive the machines and repay your kindness by increasing production. We have heard that the Chinese people were able to build a house with broken bricks, and we must learn this spirit. We will make the things needed to repair the factory with our own hands in a short period of time. Now part of our factory has already started operating."
    The mothers and wives of these workers have now come out of the caves or underground and are starting to build houses. They don't need carpenters, because they themselves have become carpenters.
    A comrade from the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea once said to me:
      "I heard that the scenery in Korea is very beautiful, but in my opinion, those newly built small houses are even more beautiful."
    I believe that this is because he loves the Korean people, loves the life of the Korean people, so he feels that those houses nailed together with broken boards are even more beautiful. Because workers, farmers, and fishermen live here, and the letters from home written by the People's Army are sent to these houses.
    The windows of these houses are pulsating with life and overflowing with songs of peace. The voice coming from here is the voice of the motherland. This voice exists in every corner of the world, and it is the voice of people who love peace and justice. These voices, when connected, will form a strong call.
    People who love peace! Please listen to the call of the Korean people, this is a call for peace that is completely the same as your call!

### 和平的呼声

    和平的呼声
    朝鲜　韩雪野
    我出席一九五三年十一月间在维也纳召开的世界和平理事会会议时，沿途深深地体会到中国人民和苏联人民从内心里对朝鲜停战所表示的喜悦；深深地体会到他们把朝鲜人民的痛苦看做自己的痛苦、把朝鲜人民的欢欣看做自己的欢欣的崇高的精神。
  一到中国，这里的人首先谈到的是：“平壤建设得怎样了？新建成多少房屋？”这些询问，表示了中国人民对朝鲜恢复和建设的极度关心，也表示了中国人民的确信：在饱经战火的朝鲜，在城市和农村已经变成废墟的朝鲜，一定会建设起美丽的生活的。
    当我到达苏联，到达布达佩斯，或是到达维也纳的时候，人们也是首先询问朝鲜战后恢复建设的情况。他们完全相信在祖国解放战争中发挥了无比的勇敢精神的朝鲜人民，在战后一定能创造出美好的生活的。
    我在这次和平理事会会议期间，看到了关于中朝经济及文化合作协定签订的报道。同座的很多代表都用铅笔计算着中国援助朝鲜的巨款的数目。但是，我们所感激的更重要的是中国人民在援助中所表现的崇高的精神。这种精神是具有历史性的。记得那还是金日成元帅在中国东北进行抗日游击斗争的时候，一次，一个中国同志，因为他掩护了游击队，被日寇剥光衣服，捆绑起来拷打了几个小时，但他一直没有说出游击队的所在地。由于他的坚贞不屈，游击队才得以安然返回根据地。由此来看，今天的罗盛教就绝不是偶然产生的了。
    我们朝鲜人民，向来也是以他的不屈著称，我想起了这样一件事，那是一九五○年十月间，战争处在最困难的时刻，金日成元帅一天晚上在路上遇到了一支唱着歌子前进的队伍。于是金日成元帅便停车问道：
    “从那儿来的队伍？”
    队伍回答：“说是朝鲜有三千里长，我们走了四千里了！”
    由于天黑，队伍也不知道是谁在问。但是金元帅这时已经察觉到这是一支孩子组成的队伍了。于是问道：
    “你们这些孩子们到那儿去呢？”
    “我们是从庆尚北道尚州来的少年团，要见金日成将军。”
    “为什么？”
    “我们找金日成将军要军装，要枪炮。我们要参军解放自己的故乡。”
    这些孩子们的气魄和精神，是和朝鲜青年、朝鲜人民军一模一样的。正因为如此，朝鲜人民才能在空前残酷的战争中取得胜利。
    朝鲜人民，在战争中勇敢地斗争了过来，在停战以后，又开始为了重建祖国而紧张劳动了。停战以后曾有一个外国访问团访问某工厂，他们问工人们：
    “现在你们在生活方面最需要的是什么？请告诉我们吧，我国人民会给你们送来的。”
    工人们很坚强地回答说：“我们不需要别的，最需要机器！不劳动是无脸接受援助的！”
    正是这种精神，使工人们产生了无穷的智慧和力量，才使得化学工厂和电气熔炉能够修复，才使得千疮百孔的机车重新奔驰。
    不久以前，当中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团携带很多礼物到某工厂访问时，工人们感动地表示：
      “我们一定会叫机器复活，用增加生产来报答你们的恩情。我们听说从前中国人能用碎砖盖一座房子，我们一定学习这种精神。我们要在短时期内用自己的手做出修复工厂用的东西。现在我们工厂已经有一部分开工了。”
    这些工人们的母亲和妻子，现在已经从山洞里或地底下走出来，着手建造房屋。她们并不需要木工，因为她们自己本身就都成为木工了。
    一位中国人民赴朝慰问团的同志曾对我说：
      “听说朝鲜的风景很美丽，可是在我看来那些新建的小房子却更美丽。”
    我认为这是由于他热爱朝鲜人民，热爱朝鲜人民的生活，所以才感到那些用破板钉起来的房子更美丽。因为这里面住的是工人、农民和渔民，从人民军中写回来的家信就是送到这些房子里去的。
    这些房子的窗户里跳动着生活的脉搏，洋溢着和平的歌声。从这里面传出来的声音就是祖国的声音。世界上的任何一个角落里都有这种声音，也就是热爱和平和正义的人们的呼声。这些呼声连贯起来便会形成强烈的呼声。
    爱好和平的人们啊！请听朝鲜人民的呼声，这是和你们的呼声完全相同的和平的呼声！
