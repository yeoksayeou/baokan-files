Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: Hundreds of thousands of voters in various districts of the capital city solemnly exercised their rights today, January 24th, by directly and secretly voting to elect representatives to the District People's Congress.

Today, the life of the people of the capital began earlier than usual. Before the morning mist had dissipated, groups of people carrying red flags and beating gongs and drums appeared on the streets, heading to the polling stations, which were adorned with slogans and posters celebrating the general election. Hundreds of polling stations in various districts were crowded with people waiting to vote even before the voting began.

At exactly 8:00 AM, the doors of countless polling stations opened, and voters solemnly lined up and walked to the verification desk. Each person received a ballot with the names of the candidates printed on it. The candidates were nominated after full consultation by the masses. Each voter could elect the person they loved and supported according to their own will, even if they were not on the list of candidates.

The atmosphere was particularly enthusiastic in the voting lines of voters from central, North China, and Beijing municipal organs. Many leaders of units participated in the voting together with voters from their residential districts.

Among the responsible persons of the central government departments who voted today were: Luo Ruiqing, Wang Heshou, Huang Jing, Jiang Guangnai, Zhang Naiqi, Teng Daiyuan, Zhu Xuefan, Zhang Bojun, Li Shucheng, Liang Xi, Li Lisan, Chen Shaoyu, He Xiangning, Hu Yuzhi, and others.

Responsible persons of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau and the North China Administrative Committee, Bo Yibo, Liu Lantao, Wang Congwu, Liu Xiufeng, Zhang Pan Shi, Zhang Su, and others also voted successively.

Peng Zhen, the Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, participated in the voting among the voters from the Dongjiaominxiang organs and construction sites.

The workers of the capital participated in the voting with their outstanding production achievements. The workers of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, who completed the production plan of the universal milling machine for twenty-six days in twenty-three days in January, gathered early in the morning to vote. In the first polling station of the Baizhifang electoral district in Xuanwu District, groups of printing workers and construction workers were waiting before 8:00 AM. This station was set up in the auditorium of the Beijing People's Printing Factory. Since the general election began in December of last year, the workers of this printing factory have launched a production competition to welcome the general election, and so far, they have completed the production plan in a balanced and over-fulfilled manner. Today, the printing workers lined up to participate in the voting with unparalleled pride and excitement. Young female worker Gao Wenzhi was on the night shift yesterday, and went to vote as soon as she got up today. Wang Caixian, an outstanding female worker in the factory, was also the first to vote in her electoral district. In an electoral district south of Xizhimen in Xisi District, a long line of workers arrived as night fell. They were the workers of the Xinhua Printing Factory, who gloriously bear the task of printing Marxist-Leninist books. At the front of the line was Gong Caiyuan, the most outstanding young worker in the factory. Last year, the workers of this printing factory increased production and saved more than 7 billion yuan in wealth for the country, and in the first two ten-day periods of January this year, they also completed the state's production tasks in a balanced and over-fulfilled manner. In the voting team of the workers of the People's Leather Sports Goods Factory, there were seven red flags, which were the award flags won by the seven production teams of the factory's manufacturing department for continuously over-fulfilling the production plan every month in the fourth quarter of last year.

"China's Paul Korchagin" - Wu Yunduo's words represent the feelings of everyone in the capital today. He said, "I have experienced many 'January 24ths' in my life, and the most precious is today - as a glorious voter in the capital, voting to elect representatives to the District People's Congress!"

Wu Yuzhang, the president of Renmin University of China, also participated in the voting today.

The largest engineering university in the country, Tsinghua University, turned into a sea of joy on election day. At six o'clock in the morning, many young people waiting to vote had already appeared in the square. Teams of voters came like a tide, carrying red flags and playing accordions. Before the voting even started, songs, dances, and cheers had spread throughout the square. The most popular were the candidates for people's representatives. When Ye Yuru, a student from the Department of Architecture and a candidate, appeared in front of the voters, the voters repeatedly lifted her up, shouting as they tossed her, "We want to vote for Ye Yuru." After voting, many voters took pictures with the candidates to commemorate this meaningful day.

In the Central Institute for Nationalities, which has students from forty-seven ethnic groups, voters from all ethnic groups from all over the motherland participated in the voting wearing their national costumes, as if it were a festival. They enjoyed full democratic rights in the big family of the motherland. The first to vote was Duan Qingjing, a 21-year-old female youth of the Minzu ethnic group.

People in the literary and art circles appeared more active on this joyful day. When the dancers of the Central Song and Dance Troupe and the dancers of the Central Experimental Opera House Dance Team waited to vote in front of the first polling station in the Ximeichang electoral district of Xisi District, they excitedly performed the excellent Chinese folk art programs "Running Donkey" and "Lion Dance," and performed their recently rehearsed "Dragon Lantern." Female actors, dressed more beautifully than usual, also danced the yangko dance. Han Shichang, a Kunqu Opera teacher in his fifties, also participated in the yangko dance with his voter registration card.

Among the famous literary and art figures in our country who participated in the voting today were Mao Dun, Lü Ji, Dai Ailian, and Wang Zunsan.

Mei Lanfang, the director of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera and a famous Peking Opera actor who has been engaged in artistic life for nearly fifty years, also rushed back to Beijing from Tianjin yesterday afternoon to participate in the election. He said excitedly after voting, "I have lived for sixty years, and today is the first time I have voted to elect my own representatives. It is especially joyful that I am participating in the election in the capital."

Among those who participated in the voting today were also famous scientists in our country, Li Siguang, Tao Menghe, Zhu Kezhen, Wu Youxun, and Zhang Jiafu.

From morning till night, millions of working people constantly went to the polling stations. Countless people were saying the same thing: "Go vote! Go vote!" Countless people have a common will: to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and strive to build our country into a great socialist country. Among the crowd were representatives of various ethnic minorities, responsible persons of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and many family members of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army; there were also overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia, Malaya, Vietnam, Myanmar, and other places.

In order to enable voters who cannot personally go to the polling stations to exercise their rights, mobile ballot boxes have been set up in various electoral districts. Fu Lin, a female voter at No. 131 Jinyuchi Street, Chongwen District, cast the first vote in the mobile ballot box of the Luban Museum electoral district. She is the wife of worker Geng Dehai. Before liberation, seven children she gave birth to died of hunger and disease. Twelve days ago, she gave birth to another boy weighing more than nine pounds, named "Minsheng" (People's Livelihood) to commemorate the child being born in this era of the people. When the mobile ballot box was placed in front of her bed, she stood up excitedly and voted.

Qianmen Street, the concentrated area of ​​industrialists and businessmen in the capital, was also very lively today. Industrialists and businessmen also happily participated in the election.

Diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries stationed in China also visited the general election in the capital today. They celebrated this meaningful day with the people of the capital.

    上午八时正，无数选举站的大门开启了，选民们严肃地列队走到验证处，每人领到一张选举票，票上印着候选人的姓名，候选人是由广大群众经过充分酝酿提出来的，每个选民可以按照自己的意志选举自己爱戴的人，即使是候选人名单以外的也可以。

    今天从早到晚，千万劳动人民不断地走到投票站去。无数的人说着同样的话：“投票去！投票去！”无数的人怀着一个共同的意志：巩固人民民主专政，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。在人群中有各少数民族，有各民主党派和各人民团体的负责人，也有许多中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军的家属；有从印尼、马来亚、越南、缅甸等地回国的华侨。
    为了使不能亲自到选举站参加投票的选民们能行使自己的权利，各选区都设有流动票箱。崇文区金鱼池大街一百三十一号女选民傅林，在鲁班馆选区的流动票箱投了第一票。她是工人耿德海的妻子，在解放前她生的七个孩子都因饥饿疾病而死了，十二天以前她又生了一个九磅多重的男孩子，取名叫做“民生”，为的是纪念这个孩子生在这人民的时代。当流动票箱放在她床前的时候，她激动地站起来投了票。
    在首都工商业家集中地区前门大街今天也非常热闹，工商业家们也愉快地参加了选举。
    苏联及人民民主国家驻我国使节及外交官员，今天也参观了首都的普选。他们和首都人民一齐欢度了这有意义的一天。
