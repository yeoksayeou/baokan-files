Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 15th: Bucharest Dispatch: The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" recently published (issued January 8th) a long article by M. Miting entitled "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

Miting wrote: The entire glorious life and revolutionary activities of Mao Zedong, the long-tested leader of the Communist Party of China, are closely linked with the heroic struggle of the laboring Chinese people for freedom and independence, a struggle that ultimately won a great victory and established the People's Republic of China. Mao Zedong combined Marxist-Leninist theory with the practice of the Chinese revolution and with the building of a new people's democratic state in China, creatively developing Marxist-Leninist theory.

Miting continued: In his writings, Mao Zedong theoretically summarized the rich experience of national liberation and the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people for their liberation. Mao Zedong's articles on the analysis of various classes in Chinese society, the nature of the Chinese revolution, the driving force of the Chinese revolution, the leadership of the proletariat, the transformation of the bourgeois democratic revolution into a socialist revolution, the role of the Chinese Communist Party in the broad national struggle, and the importance of establishing close ties between the Party and the broad masses, armed the Communist Party and the people, enabling them to clearly understand their tasks; these articles created all the necessary prerequisites for the complete victory of the Chinese revolution.

Regarding Mao Zedong's writings on military affairs, Miting pointed out: Mao Zedong's writings prove that he is not only the great leader of the Chinese people and the long-tested leader of the Communist Party, but also a distinguished military commander and an outstanding military theorist. Mao Zedong's comprehensive and precise analysis of the issue of the anti-Japanese national united front was of particularly great significance to the victory of the Chinese people's struggle against Japanese imperialism.

Miting pointed out: A characteristic of all of Mao Zedong's works is that they are filled with tremendous respect and deep love for the Soviet Union. In all his writings, Mao Zedong shows himself to be a loyal friend of the Soviet people, a true standard-bearer of the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Mao Zedong's writings on philosophy and literature demonstrate that the Chinese Communist Party is very concerned about ideological issues.

Miting concluded: The value of Mao Zedong's works lies in their rich embodiment and theoretical summarization of all the outstanding events of the Chinese revolution, and the enormous role played by the heroic Chinese Communist Party in it. The publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's works is a major event in the intellectual life of the people of the democratic camp. It is of great significance not only for the Chinese Communist Party, but also for all Communist and Workers' Parties at the forefront of all peoples fighting for peace, national independence, and socialism.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 15th: The English edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 1, has been published by People's Publishing House in Bombay and is being sold in major Indian cities.

    米丁写道：中国共产党久经考验的领袖毛泽东的整个辉煌的一生和革命活动，是与热爱劳动的中国人民争取自由和独立的英勇斗争紧密地联系在一起的，这个斗争最后获得了伟大的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。毛泽东把马克思列宁主义理论与中国革命的实践相结合、与在中国建设新的人民民主国家相结合，他创造性地发展着马克思列宁主义理论。
    米丁接着写道：毛泽东在他的著作中，在理论上总结了民族解放、中国人民为争取他们的解放而进行的革命斗争的丰富经验。毛泽东的关于中国社会各阶级的分析、中国革命的性质、中国革命的动力、无产阶级领导权、资产阶级民主革命转变为社会主义革命、中国共产党在广大的民族斗争中的作用、党和广大群众建立密切联系的重要性的文章，武装了共产党和人民，使他们清楚地认识到他们的任务；这些文章并为中国革命的完全胜利创造了一切必要的先决条件。
    关于毛泽东在军事方面的著作，米丁指出：毛泽东的著作证明他不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖和共产党的久经考验的领袖，而且是一位杰出的军事将领和一位卓越的军事理论家。毛泽东对于抗日民族统一战线问题的全面的精密分析，对中国人民反对日本帝国主义的斗争的胜利是有特别重大的意义的。
    米丁指出：毛泽东的全部著作的一个特点就是：它们都充满着对苏联的巨大的尊重和深挚的热爱。毛泽东在他所有的著作中都表现他是苏联人民的忠诚的朋友，中苏两国人民的永恒友谊的真正的旗手。毛泽东关于哲学和文学问题的著作，证明中国共产党对思想问题是非常关心的。
    米丁最后写道：毛泽东著作的价值在于它们丰富地体现并在理论上总结了中国革命的一切突出事件，以及英雄的中国共产党在其中所起的巨大的作用。毛泽东同志的著作的出版，是民主阵营各国人民思想生活中的一件大事。它不仅对于中国共产党，而且对于走在所有为和平、民族独立和社会主义而斗争的人民的最前列的一切共产党和工人党来说，都具有重大的意义。
