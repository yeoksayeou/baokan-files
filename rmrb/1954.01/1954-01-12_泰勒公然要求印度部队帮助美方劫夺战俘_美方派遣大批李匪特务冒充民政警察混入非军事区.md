Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. Our Special Correspondent reports: Taylor, commander of the Eighth Army of the invading US forces in Korea, has brazenly demanded that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces serve the US's criminal plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

According to the Associated Press, when Taylor announced the US's "master plan" for plundering POWs yesterday, he said: "We hope the Indians will notify the prisoners of war, explaining what we want them to do to evacuate in an orderly manner." In other words, Taylor wants the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces to act as accomplices of the US, notifying the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in the Dongchang-ri POW camp of the US plan to plunder POWs, and to assist the US in carrying out this plan on the evening of January 22, allowing the US to plunder the POWs without any hindrance. At the same time, according to International News Service reports, the US is spreading rumors through its South Korean puppet, saying that "Indian officers have privately assured the 'United Nations forces' officers that the Indian troops will not obstruct the release of prisoners of war."

The US's treatment of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian troops as tools that it can use at will is clearly an open imposition of pressure and insult on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian troops. Any independent and self-respecting neutral country should never abandon the sacred responsibility entrusted to them by the Korean Armistice Agreement and succumb to such arrogant demands from the US.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. Our Special Correspondent reports: The US is sending Syngman Rhee secret agents disguised as US civil police into the demilitarized zone, plotting to use them to plunder prisoners of war.

Taylor, commander of the Eighth Army of the US forces, announced yesterday that the one directly executing the US plan to plunder POWs is Brian, who once served as the US chief member of the Military Armistice Commission. This commander of the First Corps of the invading US forces in Korea, who has always claimed that the US complies with the armistice agreement, will command the Syngman Rhee bandit secret agents disguised as US civil police in the southern part of the demilitarized zone on the evening of January 22, and collude with the secret agents in the South Camp to plunder the POWs. Taylor declared yesterday that in the "past three or four days," a large number of Syngman Rhee's "military police" have been "patrolling" in the demilitarized zone together with the US Marines. He said they will "help with the POW transfer on January 23," at which time Syngman Rhee's "military police will be very useful."

According to United Press reports, people in the Syngman Rhee clique in Seoul revealed that on the evening of the 5th of this month, "five hundred uniformed police officers were sent to the truce area," and "three hundred plainclothes police officers" "moved north from Seoul" on the evening of the 6th. This person revealed that the reason the US wants to use civil police to plunder POWs is because it fears that using troops to invade the demilitarized zone to plunder POWs will make it impossible for the US to shirk responsibility for undermining the armistice. This person said that the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's "police" "being transferred to the truce headquarters area clearly shows that if any action is taken against the Indian troops, it will be a 'police action' rather than a 'military action' taken by the South Korean army.'"

Taylor also stated that in the event of an "attack" occurring because the Indian troops do not allow the Syngman Rhee secret agents to plunder the POWs, he will "send US and other 'United Nations forces' to protect the Indian Custodial Forces." Anyone can see that this so-called "protection" is actually using US troops to surround the Indian Custodial Forces, rendering them unable to move, so that the conspiracy to plunder POWs can be realized.

The Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates the establishment of civil police in the demilitarized zone in order to ensure the stability of the armistice. The US is now sending large numbers of Syngman Rhee secret agents disguised as civil police into the demilitarized zone and using them to plunder POWs, which shows their determination to make the unstable Korean armistice situation even more serious.

    泰勒公然要求印度部队帮助美方劫夺战俘
    美方派遣大批李匪特务冒充民政警察混入非军事区
    【新华社开城十日电】本社特派记者报道：侵朝美军第八军军长泰勒竟公然要求中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队为美方强迫扣留战俘的罪恶计划服务。
    据美联社报道，泰勒在昨天宣布美方劫夺战俘的“总计划”时说：“我们希望印度人将通知战俘们，说明我们希望他们怎么样有秩序撤离。”换句话说，泰勒要中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队充当美方的帮凶，将美方劫夺战俘的计划通知东场里战俘营内的李、蒋特务，并在一月二十二日晚上协助美方执行这个计划，听任美方劫走战俘而不加制止。同时，据国际新闻社报道，美方正在通过其南朝鲜傀儡散布空气，说什么“印度军官已经私下向联军军官们保证，印度军队将不阻碍释放战俘”。
    美方将中立国遣返委员会和印度部队当作可以随意由它利用的工具，显然是公开对中立国遣返委员会和印度部队施行压力和加以侮辱。任何独立自尊的中立国家，是决不应该放弃朝鲜停战协定所赋予它们的神圣责任而屈从美方的这种狂妄要求的。
    【新华社开城十日电】本社特派记者报道：美方将李承晚特务混充美方民政警察开入非军事区，阴谋利用他们来劫夺战俘。
    美军第八军军长泰勒在昨天宣布，直接执行美方劫夺战俘的计划的就是曾经充当军事停战委员会美方首席委员的勃里安。这个一贯口口声声说美方遵守停战协定的侵朝美军第一兵团司令，将在一月二十二日晚上指挥混充非军事区南部的美方民政警察的李匪特务，和南营中的特务分子里应外合，将战俘劫走。泰勒在昨天宣称，在“过去三、四天内”，有大批李承晚匪帮的“宪兵”和美国海军陆战队一起在非军事区进行“巡逻”。他说，他们将“帮助在一月二十三日进行的战俘移交工作”，那时李承晚的“宪兵将是非常有用的”。
    据合众社报道，汉城李承晚集团中的人透露，在本月五日晚上，已有“五百名穿制服的警察被派往停战地区”，还有“三百名便衣警察”在六日晚上“从汉城向北出动”。这个人透露，美方所以要利用民政警察来劫夺战俘，是因为恐怕用军队侵入非军事区劫夺战俘会使美方无法推卸破坏停战的责任。这个人说，李承晚匪帮的“警察”“被调到停战总部地区一举表明：如果对印度部队采取任何行动的话，那将是一种‘警察行动’，而不是由南朝鲜军队采取的‘军事行动’。”
    泰勒并且表示，在一旦由于印度部队不让李承晚特务劫走战俘而发生“攻击事件”时，他将“派美军和其他联军部队前去保护印度看管部队”。谁都可以看得出来，这种所谓“保护”，实际上就是用美军包围印度看管部队，使它动弹不得，以便劫夺战俘的阴谋得以实现。
    朝鲜停战协定规定在非军事区设立民政警察，原是为了保证停战的稳定。美方现在将大批李匪特务冒充民政警察混入非军事区，并且利用他们来劫夺战俘，这表明他们决心使不稳定的朝鲜停战局势更加严重化起来。
