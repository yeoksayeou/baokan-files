    Leninism is the Banner Under Which the Chinese People Struggle to Build Socialism
    —In Commemoration of the Thirtieth Anniversary of Lenin's Death (Written for "Pravda")
    Zhu De, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Thirty years have passed since the death of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the greatest revolutionary genius and teacher of mankind.

    Lenin was the beloved teacher and friend of the Chinese people. Leninism is the victorious banner of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. Before finding Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese people had suffered many failures in the struggle against foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism. It was during such times that Lenin, in his brilliant political essays and revolutionary activities, extended profound sympathy and concern to the Chinese people and illuminated the path of the Chinese revolution with his theory on national and colonial questions. Lenin taught that the people of the colonies could only advance to the socialist revolution through a bourgeois democratic revolution, and that the key to solving this task lay in the leadership of the proletariat. Lenin developed the Marxist theory of the transformation of the bourgeois democratic revolution into a socialist revolution and brilliantly proved this theory in the practice of the Russian revolution. Lenin taught that communists in colonial and semi-colonial countries must be good at applying this theory according to the specific social and historical conditions of their own countries, in order to strive for the independence and liberation of their own nations.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's guiding ideology for the Chinese revolution is based on this principle of Lenin's. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The entire Chinese revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party of China is a complete revolutionary movement including the two stages of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution; these are two revolutionary processes of different natures, and it is only possible to complete the latter revolutionary process after completing the former. The democratic revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable trend of the democratic revolution. And the ultimate goal of all communists is to strive for the ultimate completion of socialist society and communist society."

    After Lenin's death, the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong accepted the experience of the three revolutions in Russia led by Lenin, and developed Leninism's tactical thinking, leading the Chinese people with astonishing courage and perseverance through a long period of repeated revolutionary wars, overthrowing the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and establishing in 1949 a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. In this way, the democratic revolution stage in China was basically ended and the socialist revolution stage was entered.

    The complete victory of the Chinese people in the democratic revolution opened up the road to socialism. This is a great victory of Leninism in the East, and it powerfully proves Lenin's creative doctrine: "Backward countries can avoid the stage of capitalist development, transition to the Soviet system with the help of the proletariat of the most advanced countries, and transition to communism through a certain stage of development." ("Report at the Second Congress of the Communist International") Because the Communist Party of China, in accordance with Lenin's instructions, correctly adhered to the leadership of the working class in the revolution and the worker-peasant alliance, it has made it fully possible for China, with the help of the Soviet Union, to avoid the stage of capitalist development, and to use the measures of the people's democratic regime from top to bottom and the support of the broad masses of workers and peasants from bottom to top to strive for the complete victory of the socialist revolution.

    After the victory of the revolution in China, the People's Government immediately announced the abolition of the feudal land system and launched the largest peasant movement in history, carrying out land reform, so that hundreds of millions of peasants across the country obtained about 47 million hectares of land. The landlord as a class has been permanently eliminated. The 100 billion jin of grain that farmers used to pay to landlords as rent every year has been permanently eliminated. At the same time, the factories, mines, transportation, commerce, banks and other properties concentrated in the hands of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie were confiscated and nationalized, which enabled the people's democratic state to control the fundamental lifelines of the national economy.

    In the three years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Government continued to adopt restrictive policies on the scope of activities, taxation, market prices, and labor conditions of capitalist economic components, developed and built new state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature, and developed tens of thousands of consumer cooperatives and state-owned stores to prevent speculation by private merchants. For some capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises, joint state-private ownership and other methods were used to bring them into the orbit of state capitalism.

    These measures completely eradicated the political and economic forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China.

    In the new Chinese economy, there are five components, namely: the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, the small commodity economy, the private capitalist economy, and the state capitalist economy. Among them, the socialist economy occupies a leading position in the entire national economy, and it is gradually growing under the people's democratic system and playing the role of gradually replacing the non-socialist economy.

    The simultaneous existence and mutual struggle of the socialist economy and the non-socialist economy are the characteristics of the current Chinese social economy. This feature shows that China is in a transitional period towards the development of socialist society. As Lenin said: "Between capitalism and communism, there is a considerable transition period, which is undoubtedly true in theory. This transition period cannot but contain the characteristics or features of these two socio-economic structures. This transition period cannot but be a period of struggle between dying capitalism and growing communism." ("Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat") The theory of the transition period established by Lenin and developed by Stalin is completely applicable to the current China. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are following the theories of Lenin and Stalin, learning from the rich experience of the Soviet Union in socialist construction, and striving to build a socialist society in China. Because the Chinese regime is a people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the working class, the end of the transition period must be the elimination of capitalism and the victory of socialism.

    However, China is an agricultural country that has been in a backward state for a long time, and its industrial base is very weak. Modern industry using machinery is mainly light industry. The output value of modern industry accounted for about 17 percent of the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1949. After the recovery period from 1950 to 1952, it only accounted for about 28 percent of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Private capitalist industry accounts for a large proportion of modern industry, with its output value accounting for 63 percent in 1949 and about 40 percent in 1952. Agriculture, together with other sideline industries, individual handicrafts, and workshops, accounted for about 83 percent of the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1949; after the industrial production was greatly restored and improved from 1950 to 1952, it still accounted for about 72 percent. After the land reform, the peasants obtained land and improved their lives, and a large number of poor peasants rose to become middle peasants, but because the production of the peasants is dispersed and carried out using backward simple tools, the output is still not very high, and the marketable grain and raw material crops they can supply are far from enough to meet the growing demand for agriculture due to the country's industrial development.

    Due to the seriously backward state of industry and agriculture, building socialism in China cannot but be an extremely arduous task. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the basic completion of the socialist transformation, this is a transition period. The general line and general task of the Party in this transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a fairly long period of time, and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the state on agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. This general line is the beacon illuminating our various tasks. Any task that deviates from it will commit right-leaning or 'left'-leaning errors."

      In order to achieve this task, the Chinese people carried out tremendous economic recovery work from 1950 to 1952, laying the foundation for the country's socialist industrialization. In 1953, our country began the first five-year plan for socialist construction.

    Our country's socialist construction plan is formulated based on the theory of socialist industrialization of Lenin and Stalin, the great successor of Lenin's cause. Its basic task is to develop heavy industry in order to establish the foundation for national industrialization and defense modernization. At the same time, in order to adapt to this task, the transportation industry, light industry, commerce, and cultural and educational undertakings should be developed accordingly, and the cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts should be promoted, and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce should be further implemented, and the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce should be correctly brought into play in order to ensure the steady growth of socialist components in the national economy and improve the material and cultural living standards of the people.

    This is a great beginning to completely transform China's face.

    According to this plan, China's dilapidated and backward industrial situation will be changed. Existing industries will be developed on the original basis, and new and large-scale socialist industries will be systematically established.

    According to the first five-year plan, in agriculture, about 20 percent of China's individual agriculture will be replaced by agricultural production cooperatives. Large-scale state-owned farms using machinery will be developed and become an important part of agricultural production. In terms of handicrafts, we will move further towards cooperativization.

    According to the first five-year plan, capitalist industry and commerce will be gradually transformed with the development of socialist industry and commerce, and their proportion in the national economy will continue to shrink.

    According to the first five-year plan, the number of the Chinese working class will be greatly developed, the leading role of the working class in the country will be further strengthened, and the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class will also be further strengthened. This will add conditions for the complete victory of the socialist transformation.

    China is a country rich in natural resources, China has about a quarter of the world's population, and the Chinese people have a tradition of courage and diligence. Under the banner of great Leninism, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people will victoriously and steadily complete the great cause of socialist construction with their creative labor in a fairly long period of time. In particular, due to the increasing strength of the great ally, the Soviet Union, and its selfless assistance to the Chinese people, China's socialist construction has obtained very favorable conditions. The Soviet government decided to use its advanced experience and sophisticated technical equipment to assist China in the construction and renovation of 141 large-scale projects from 1950 to 1959, and to solve various difficulties that China may encounter in its development. This is international assistance that the Soviet Union could not get during its socialist construction. As Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhou Enlai said in their telegram to Comrades Malenkov and Molotov on September 2, 1953, "This is an important factor for the rapid recovery of the Chinese economy and the road to planned construction."

    The victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of Leninism. Every step forward in China's socialist construction, without a doubt, will promote the advancement of Lenin's cause—the cause of liberating world humanity. Lenin pointed out thirty years ago that as a result of the involvement of countries such as Russia and China, which account for the vast majority of the world's population, in the world struggle, "the final victory of socialism is completely and absolutely guaranteed." History has proven Lenin's scientific prediction. The Chinese Communists and Comrade Mao Zedong are loyal students of Lenin. They will lead the Chinese people, as in the past thirty years, to hold high the banner of Lenin and resolutely fight to build a socialist society in China.

    列宁主义是中国人民为建设社会主义而斗争的旗帜
    ——纪念列宁逝世三十年（为“真理报”而作）
    中国共产党中央政治局委员　朱　德
    世界人类最伟大的革命的天才的导师乌拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁逝世三十年了。
    列宁是中国人民的亲爱的导师和朋友。列宁主义是中国人民革命斗争的胜利旗帜。中国人民在找到马克思列宁主义以前，曾经在反对外国帝国主义和本国封建主义的斗争中遭受过许多次的失败。就在那样的时期中，列宁在他的辉煌的政论中和革命活动中曾寄予中国人民以深刻的同情和关怀，并用他的关于民族和殖民地问题的理论照耀了中国革命的道路。列宁教导说，殖民地人民只有经过资产阶级民主革命才能进到社会主义革命，而解决这个任务的关键，在于无产阶级的领导权。列宁发展了马克思主义关于资产阶级民主革命转变为社会主义革命的理论，并在俄国革命实践中光辉地证明了这个理论。列宁教导说，殖民地和半殖民地的共产主义者必须善于按照自己国家具体的社会历史条件来运用这个理论，以争取自己民族的独立和解放。
    毛泽东同志关于中国革命的指导思想，就是以列宁的这个原理为根据的。毛泽东同志指出：“中国共产党领导的整个中国革命运动，是包括民主主义革命和社会主义革命两个阶段在内的全部革命运动；这是两个性质不同的革命过程，只有完成了前一个革命过程才有可能去完成后一个革命过程。民主主义革命是社会主义革命的必要准备，社会主义革命是民主主义革命的必然趋势。而一切共产主义者的最后目的，则是在于力争社会主义社会和共产主义社会的最后的完成。”
    在列宁逝世以后，中国共产党和毛泽东同志接受了列宁领导的俄国三次革命的经验，并发挥了列宁主义的策略思想，以惊人的勇敢和毅力领导中国人民经过长时期的反复的革命战争，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，并在一九四九年建立了工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的政权。这样，就在基本上结束了中国的民主革命阶段并转入了社会主义革命阶段。
    中国人民在民主革命中所取得的彻底胜利打开了通往社会主义的大路。这是列宁主义在东方的伟大胜利，它有力地证明了列宁的创造性的学说：“在最先进国家底无产阶级帮助之下，落后国家可以避免资本主义的发展阶段，过渡到苏维埃制度，并经过一定的发展阶段过渡到共产主义。”（“在共产国际第二次代表大会上的报告”）由于中国共产党按照列宁的指示，正确地坚持了工人阶级在革命中的领导权和工农联盟，这就使得中国在苏联的帮助之下有充分的可能避免资本主义的发展阶段，运用人民民主政权自上而下的措施和广大工农群众的自下而上的支持来争取社会主义革命的彻底胜利。
    中国在革命胜利以后，人民政府立即宣布废除封建主义的土地制度，并发动了历史上最广大的农民运动，进行土地改革，使全国数达三亿的农民获得了约四千七百万公顷的土地。地主作为一个阶级，已被永远消灭。农民在过去每年交纳给地主作为地租的一千亿斤的粮食，已经永远免除了。同时没收了集中在官僚资产阶级手中的工厂、矿山、交通运输、商业、银行及其他财产归国家所有，这就使人民民主国家掌握了国民经济的根本命脉。
    在中华人民共和国成立以后的三年间，人民政府又继续对资本主义的经济成分在活动范围、税收、市场价格及劳动条件等方面采取了限制政策，发展和新建了社会主义性质的国营企业，发展了成千成万的消费合作社和国营商店以制止私商的投机活动。对一部分资本主义工商业，则用公私合营等办法使之纳入了国家资本主义的轨道。
    这些措施把帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国政治上和经济上的势力彻底地铲除了。
    在新中国的经济中，包括五种成分，即：国营经济、合作社经济、小商品经济、私人资本主义经济及国家资本主义经济。其中，社会主义性质的经济在整个国民经济中占有领导地位，它在人民民主制度下逐步地增长着，并起着逐步代替非社会主义经济的作用。
    社会主义经济和非社会主义经济的同时存在和互相斗争，是目前中国社会经济的特点。这个特点说明中国正处于向社会主义社会发展的过渡时期。正如列宁所说：“在资本主义和共产主义中间横着有一个相当的过渡时期，这在理论上是毫无疑义的。这个过渡时期不能不含有这两种社会经济结构的特点或特征。这个过渡时期不能不是死亡着的资本主义与生长着的共产主义彼此斗争的时期”。（“无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治”）由列宁所建立并为斯大林所发展了的关于过渡时期的理论，对于现在的中国是完全适用的。中国共产党和中国人民正在遵循着列宁和斯大林的理论，学习着苏联在社会主义建设中的丰富经验，为在中国建成社会主义社会而奋斗。由于中国政权是在中国共产党和工人阶级领导下的人民民主专政，过渡时期的终结必然是资本主义的消灭和社会主义的胜利。
    但是，中国是一个长时期处于落后状态的农业国家，工业基础非常薄弱。使用机器的现代工业主要是轻工业。现代工业的产值在一九四九年约占工农业总产值的百分之十七，经过一九五○年至一九五二年的恢复时期，还只占工农业总产值的百分之二十八左右。在现代工业中私人资本主义工业占有很大的比例，其产值在一九四九年为百分之六十三，在一九五二年为百分之四十左右。农业连同其他副业、个体手工业和工场手工业的产值，在一九四九年约占工农业总产值百分之八十三；在一九五○年至一九五二年工业生产大大恢复和提高以后，仍占百分之七十二左右。土地改革以后，农民获得了土地，改善了生活，且有大量贫农上升为中农，但由于农民的生产是分散的和使用落后的简单工具进行耕作，所以产量还不很高，他们所能供给的商品粮食和原料作物远不足以适应国家因工业发展而日益扩大的对农业的要求。
    由于工业和农业严重落后的状况，在中国建设社会主义的事业不能不是一个极其艰巨的任务。毛泽东同志指出：“从中华人民共和国成立，到社会主义改造基本完成，这是一个过渡时期。党在这个过渡时期的总路线和总任务，是要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。这条总路线是照耀我们各项工作的灯塔，各项工作离开它，就要犯右倾或‘左’倾的错误。”
      为了实现这个任务，中国人民在一九五○——一九五二年中进行了巨大的经济恢复工作，为国家的社会主义工业化打下了基础。在一九五三年，我国开始了社会主义建设的第一个五年计划。
    我国社会主义建设计划是根据列宁和列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林关于社会主义工业化的理论而制订的。它的基本任务就是发展重工业，以建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础。同时为了适应这个任务而相应地发展交通运输业、轻工业、商业和文化教育事业，促进农业和手工业的合作化，进一步实行对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，正确地发挥个体农业、手工业及资本主义工商业的作用，以保证国民经济中社会主义成分的稳步增长，并提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。
    这是彻底改造中国面貌的伟大的开端。
    按照这个计划，中国工业的残破落后状况将被改变。旧有工业将在原来基础上得到发展，新的庞大的社会主义工业将有系统地建立起来。
    按照第一个五年计划，在农业方面，中国的个体农业将有百分之二十左右为农业生产合作社所代替。使用机器耕作的大规模的国营农场将得到发展，并成为农业生产中的一个重要部分。在手工业方面，将进一步走向合作化。
    按照第一个五年计划，资本主义工商业将随着社会主义工业和商业的发展而逐步地被改造，它们在国民经济中所占的比例将继续缩小。
    按照第一个五年计划，中国工人阶级的数量将有很大的发展，工人阶级在国家中的领导作用将进一步加强，在工人阶级领导下的工农联盟也将进一步加强。这就为社会主义改造的彻底胜利增添了条件。
    中国是天然资源丰富的国家，中国拥有世界人口约四分之一，中国人民具有勇敢勤劳的传统。在伟大的列宁主义旗帜下，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下，中国人民将在一个相当长的时期内用自己的创造性的劳动胜利地稳步地完成社会主义建设的伟大事业。特别是由于伟大盟邦苏联的日益强大和她给予中国人民的无私的援助，使中国的社会主义建设获得非常有利的条件。苏联政府决定自一九五○年到一九五九年间用自己的先进经验和精湛的技术设备援助中国建设和改建一百四十一项规模巨大的工程，并为中国解决在发展中可能遇到的各种困难，这是苏联在进行社会主义建设时期所不可能得到的国际援助。这种援助，正如毛泽东同志和周恩来同志在一九五三年九月二日致马林科夫同志和莫洛托夫同志的电文中所说：“乃是中国经济迅速恢复和走上有计划建设道路的重要因素。”
    中国革命的胜利是列宁主义的胜利。中国社会主义建设的每一步前进，毫无疑问，都将推动列宁事业——解放世界人类事业的前进。列宁在三十年前曾经指出，由于俄国和中国等占世界人口极大多数的国家卷入世界斗争的结果，“社会主义的最后胜利是完全和绝对有保证的。”历史证明了列宁的科学预见。中国共产党人和毛泽东同志是列宁的忠实的学生，他们将领导着中国人民如同过去三十年一样，高举列宁的旗帜，坚决地为在中国建成社会主义社会而斗争。
