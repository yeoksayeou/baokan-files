Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 25th. The newly built, large-scale 220,000-volt extra-high voltage transmission line in Northeast China has been completed ahead of schedule on January 23rd. On the snowy northeastern plains, a 369.25-kilometer-long metal transmission line has been ingeniously erected on top of 919 tall iron towers. Testing personnel from the Central Testing Institute of the Northeast Electric Power Administration are actively conducting various electrical performance tests on this line. The first trial transmission of the new line is about to begin, and several line protection stations have been established along the line to ensure safe power transmission. Soon, this largest-scale transmission line in China will become a major trunk line of the extra-high voltage power grid in Northeast China. According to statistics from more than a dozen industrial cities including Anshan, Shenyang, Fushun, Dalian, Benxi, and Fuxin, the electricity demand of users this year will increase by about 27% compared to last year, with the Shenyang area increasing by about 41%. After this extra-high voltage transmission line starts transmitting power, a large amount of cheap electricity will be safely and systematically transmitted to these industrial cities, meeting the power needs for industrial construction and development.

This extra-high voltage transmission line is one of the key projects of China's First Five-Year Plan. From its commencement on July 15th of last year to its recent completion, the workers, through six months and nine days of hard work, finally completed the construction task 67 days ahead of schedule. During the construction process, the workers divided the project into six main parts: surveying and exploration, pit digging and positioning, foundation pouring, iron tower erection, grounding device installation, and wire laying and tightening. These parts were constructed in an overlapping manner, so the project progressed rapidly. Nearly 10,000 cubic meters of concrete foundation work had already been completed before the ground froze on November 1st of last year. The 919 towering iron towers, composed of more than 8,000 tons of steel, were also completed on December 10th of last year.

The construction of this transmission line received enthusiastic guidance from Soviet experts, and the people of the whole country and farmers along the line also provided active support. Workers in nearly a hundred factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Shenyang, Anshan, Dalian, and other places rushed to manufacture a large number of materials for the line project, such as angle steel, round steel, flat iron, screws, steel-cored aluminum wire, steel wire, and porcelain insulators. Among them, more than 30 kinds of materials were specially trial-produced new products. Workers at the Dalian Electric Porcelain Factory enthusiastically launched a labor competition to complete the task of more than 70,000 porcelain insulators ahead of schedule.

    东北区新建的超高压送电线路提前完成
   【新华社沈阳二十五日电】东北区新建规模巨大的二十二万伏超高压送电线路，已在一月二十三日提前建成。在白雪皑皑的东北原野上，一条三百六十九点二五公里长的金属送电线，已巧妙地在九百一十九座高大铁塔的顶端架设好了。东北电业管理局中心试验所的试验人员们正在为这条线路积极进行各种电气性能的试验，新线路的第一次试送电就要开始，沿线已建立起好几个保护安全送电的保线站。不久，这条我国规模最大的送电线路就要成为东北地区超高压电力网的一条主要干线。根据鞍山、沈阳、抚顺、大连、本溪、阜新等十几个工业城市的统计，今年用电户需要的电力约比去年增长百分之二十七，其中沈阳地区约增长百分之四十一。这条超高压送电线路开始送电后，大量廉价的电力就将安全地有计划地输送给这些工业城市，满足工业建设发展的动力需要。
    这条超高压送电线路是我国第一个五年建设计划的重点工程之一。从去年七月十五日开工到最近完工，职工们经过六个月另九天的艰苦努力，终于提前六十七天完成了建设任务。在建设过程中，职工们把工程分成勘测钻探、挖坑定位、浇制基础、组立铁塔、埋接地装置和放线紧线等六个主要部分，互相交叉地施工，因此，工程进展迅速。近一万立方公尺的混凝土基础工程，在去年十一月一日封冻以前就已经完工。用八千多吨钢铁组成的九百十九座高耸天空的大铁塔，也在去年十二月十日完工。
    这条送电线路的建设，得到了苏联专家的热忱指导，全国人民和沿线农民也给以积极的支援。上海、天津、北京、沈阳、鞍山、大连等地近百个工厂的职工，曾为线路工程赶制了大量的角钢、元钢、扁铁、螺丝、钢芯铝线、钢线、瓷瓶等材料，其中有三十多种材料还是特地试制的新产品。大连电瓷厂职工为了提早完成七万多个瓷瓶任务，曾热烈地展开了劳动竞赛。
