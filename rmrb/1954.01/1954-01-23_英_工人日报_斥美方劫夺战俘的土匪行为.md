Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 22nd: The London "Workers' Daily" published an editorial on the 21st condemning the US side's criminal act of forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The editorial said: "The US is violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and handing over Chinese prisoners of war to Chiang Kai-shek." The editorial continued: "The Armistice Agreement stipulates that all prisoners of war who are said to be unwilling to be repatriated should be heard by representatives of their home countries... and handed over to the political conference for processing after the three-month period expires. However, the US has violated these provisions from the first day the agreement was reached. They sent Chiang Kai-shek's agents to the POW camps, and these agents intimidated the POWs who genuinely wished to return to their homeland. They shouted and made noise during the POW explanations, making it impossible to conduct the explanations. Since the US negotiators interrupted the talks between the two sides, the political conference also failed to convene."

The editorial said that the US's "bandit policy is being implemented under the banner of the United Nations and has received the shameful support of the British Conservative Party." The editorial concluded by calling on "the British people to force their government to adopt a policy that is completely free from US control."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 21st: Pakistani newspapers commented in editorials on the decision of the Indian Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to return the non-repatriated prisoners of war to the original detaining parties.

The "Pakistan Times" editorial on January 19th stated that the explanation work for the non-repatriated prisoners of war was only carried out for a few days during the ninety-day period. The editorial also pointed out that even after December 22nd, despite the control of many agents in the POW camps, many non-repatriated prisoners of war expressed their desire for repatriation. The editorial said: "This clearly shows that returning the prisoners of war to the Allied forces is against the wishes of the majority of the prisoners of war. The preparations made by the US military authorities for receiving these prisoners of war leave no doubt that these prisoners of war will be forcibly drafted into the puppet armies of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee." The editorial said: "The Indian representatives are fully aware of the cruel and terroristic activities organized by the US, the Kuomintang, and South Korea in Geoje Island and other POW camps, and they also know that these three parties have drafted plans to disrupt the explanation work, but they have not tried to salvage the situation in the slightest." The editorial concluded: "Because the US military authorities are determined to seize Chinese and Korean prisoners of war and draft them into the Kuomintang and South Korean armies, because Syngman Rhee has threatened to launch another attack on North Korea, and because US representatives are obstructing the preparatory talks for the political conference, peace in Korea is actually under threat."

The "Today's News" editorial on January 19th stated: "India's decision is indeed not a solution to the problem that has hindered the Korean armistice for the past three years. Indian troops were sent to Korea to protect prisoners of war who were unwilling to be repatriated and to enable representatives of both sides to conduct explanation work for the prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This goal has not been achieved. The majority of the members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's report attribute the responsibility for this failure to the United Nations Command and the South Korean government, whose agents were in the POW camps and were organized." The editorial said: "The attitude of the US generals makes it clear to everyone that their real aim is to sabotage the Korean armistice and further complicate the problem. Therefore, they must bear all the responsibility for the consequences of their actions." The editorial said: "This situation may be beneficial to American capitalists and imperialists at present, but it is extremely dangerous for strengthening world peace, especially for peace, security, freedom, and development in the Far East."

    英“工人日报”斥美方劫夺战俘的土匪行为
    【新华社柏林二十二日电】伦敦“工人日报”二十一日发表社论，谴责美方强迫扣留朝中战俘的罪恶行动。社论说：“美方正在违反朝鲜停战协定、把中国战俘交给蒋介石。”社论接着说：“停战协定规定：所有据说是不愿遣返的战俘都应该听到他们祖国的代表的解释……，在三个月期满后交给政治会议处理。但是，美方从协议达成的第一天起就破坏了这些规定。他们把蒋介石特务派到战俘营去，这些特务们在战俘营里对那些真正希望返回祖国的战俘大施恫吓。他们在战俘听取解释时大叫大闹，使得解释无法进行。由于美方谈判代表中断了双方会谈，政治会议也未能召开。”
    社论说：美方“这种土匪政策是在联合国的旗帜下被实行的，并且得到了英国保守党可耻的支持。”社论最后号召“英国人民迫使他们的政府采取完全不受美国控制的政策。”
    【新华社新德里二十一日电】巴基斯坦各报在社论中评论中立国遣返委员会印度主席把未遣返的战俘交回原拘留各方的决定。
    “巴基斯坦时报”一月十九日社论说，对未遣返战俘进行的解释工作在九十天期间只进行了几天。社论又指出，甚至在十二月二十二日以后，尽管战俘营中有许多特务控制，还有许多未遣返战俘表示他们要求遣返的愿望。社论说：“这清楚地说明，把战俘交回联军方面是违反大多数战俘的愿望的。美国军事当局接待这些战俘的准备工作使人们毫不怀疑地相信：这些战俘将被迫征入蒋介石与李承晚的伪军中去。”社论说：“印度代表完全知道美国、国民党与南朝鲜方面在巨济岛与其他战俘营中组织的残酷与恐怖活动，他们也知道这三方面已草拟了破坏解释工作的计划，但是他们却丝毫没有设法挽救这种局势。”社论最后说：“由于美军当局决心要劫夺中朝战俘，并把他们征入国民党与南朝鲜军队，由于李承晚扬言说要再度向北朝鲜发动进攻，更由于美国代表阻挠政治会议预备会谈，因此，朝鲜的和平已实际遭受威胁。”
    “今天报”一月十九日的社论说：“印度的决定的确不是解决在过去三年阻碍着朝鲜停战的问题的办法。印度军队被派到朝鲜去，是为了保护不愿遣返的战俘，并使双方代表能在中立国遣返委员会的监督下对战俘进行解释工作。这种目标没有能够达到。中立国遣返委员会在它的报告中已承认了这种失败。委员会的多数委员报告把这种失败的责任归诸联合国军司令部和南朝鲜政府，战俘营中有它们的特务分子，他们并且是有组织的。”社论说：“美国将领们的态度使人人都清楚地看出，他们的真正的目的是要破坏朝鲜停战并使问题进一步复杂化。因此对于他们行动的后果的一切责任，都得由他们来负。”社论说：“这种情况在目前可能是对于美国资本家和帝国主义者有利的，但是对于加强世界和平，特别是对远东的和平、安全、自由和发展，则是极端危险的。”
