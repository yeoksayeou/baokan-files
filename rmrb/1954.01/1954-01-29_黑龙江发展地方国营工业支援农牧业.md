　　Heilongjiang Develops Local State-Owned Industry to Support Agriculture and Animal Husbandry

    Heilongjiang Province's local state-owned industry has developed extremely rapidly, playing a significant role in supporting agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline production. In 1949, there were a total of 229 local state-owned factories in the province, and by 1953, this had increased to 248. The total output value of these factories accounted for 28.82% of the province's total national income.

    A prominent feature of Heilongjiang Province's local state-owned industry is its close coordination with agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline production, thus strongly supporting agricultural and animal husbandry production and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The province's No. 1 Local State-Owned Machinery Factory is specifically dedicated to serving agricultural production. In the past three years, the factory has manufactured new-style animal-drawn farm implements, including 21,154 integrated cultivator-harrow machines, 4,000 double-wheel single-blade plows, and 2,000 rollers. These farm implements have been used in agricultural production and have saved farmers a large amount of labor. For example, the integrated cultivator-harrow machine has been used on 200,000 hectares of land. Based on the calculation that each hectare worked by the integrated cultivator-harrow machine saves two laborers compared to old-style farm implements, and calculating two cultivations and harrows, this saves 800,000 laborers. Because of these new-style farm implements, farmers have been able to use the saved labor in other production areas. Jiujiang Wopeng Village in the Fifth District of Kaitong County used all its surplus labor last year for thinning seedlings, opening seedlings, and intensive cultivation, ensuring a larger grain harvest. In the past two years, 24,000 hectares of land in the province have been autumn-plowed and subsequently broad-sown using double-wheel single-blade plows, resulting in an average yield increase of about 15% per hectare. Lingxia Village in Baicheng County benefited from using the two-wheel single-blade plow. Last year, Lingxia Village autumn-plowed and broad-sowed a total of 70 hectares of land. After the autumn harvest, the average yield increased by more than one dan (450 jin) per hectare. Thirteen hectares of sorghum land yielded a total of 83 dan, averaging 6.4 dan per hectare, almost doubling the normal yield of 3.6 dan. Farmers said, "Human skill is no match for good tools. The working-class elder brothers have helped us harvest more grain."

    In order to enable the new-style farm implements to better serve agricultural production, the workers of the No. 1 Machinery Factory also went to the countryside to help farmers repair machinery and explain how to use it. When they arrived at the Meng Qingyu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yonghe Village, Fourteenth District of Hailun County, they were warmly welcomed by the farmers. Someone pointed to the thriving sorghum and said, "This sorghum grows so well because of the cultivator-harrow machine you made." Others said gratefully, "In the past, when people said workers were elder brothers, we didn't really understand. Now we understand. The workers are truly working for our benefit!" While in the countryside, the workers also accepted farmers' suggestions for improving the integrated cultivator-harrow machine. The No. 1 Machinery Factory plans to produce more than 13,000 integrated cultivator-harrow machines and other new-style farm implements of better quality this year to supply the needs of the countryside.

    Nenjiang, Taonan, Baicheng, and other counties in this area used to have a large amount of alkaline soil and reeds that could not be sold. Farmers used reeds for firewood. Since the construction of the No. 2 Local State-Owned Caustic Soda Factory and the No. 1 Paper Mill, farmers no longer have to worry about finding a market for alkaline soil and reeds. The No. 2 Caustic Soda Factory needs more than 10,000 tons of alkali-processed "yazi alkali" annually. At a price of 350,000 yuan per ton, the factory pays farmers 3,937,500,000 yuan annually. The No. 2 Paper Mill also buys 4,360 tons of reeds from farmers each year as raw material for papermaking.

    The recently opened Hongguang Sugar Refinery has brought new prosperity to agricultural production. The factory needs 95,628 tons of sugar beets annually, solving the problem of sugar beet sales for more than 3,000 sugar beet-growing households in the Nehe and Yian areas. Under normal circumstances, planting one hectare of sugar beets is equivalent to the income from three hectares of sorghum. Based on this calculation, farmers can benefit by 800 million yuan more than from planting sorghum. Therefore, farmers said, "This is truly the benefit that industrial development has brought us!"

    The development of industry has also had a tremendous impact on the development of animal husbandry. Anda, Zhaodong, and other areas are the center of animal husbandry development in the province. In Anda County alone, there are more than 6,700 cattle and 2,394 dairy cows. Two thousand households of farmers live by raising dairy cows. However, in the past, there was no market for milk. Whenever milk production peaked in the summer, private merchants took the opportunity to lower prices, forcing farmers to feed the milk to pigs. Last year, after the Anda Milk Powder Factory was built, it solved the problem of milk sales. The milk powder factory can now process more than 8,300 jin of fresh milk and produce more than 1,870 pounds of milk powder every day. This has greatly increased the income of herders. In the past, private merchants bought one kilogram of fresh milk from herders for 800 yuan. Now, the milk powder factory buys it for 2,400 yuan. In this way, raising one dairy cow, assuming an average daily milk production of 10 kilograms, can generate an income of 3,000,000 yuan per year. Farmers in the Anda area have seen the benefits of raising cattle. In November of last year alone, they bought another 220 dairy cows. (Liu Qun)

　　黑龙江发展地方国营工业支援农牧业
    黑龙江省地方国营工业发展极为迅速，在支援农业、畜牧业和副业生产上起了重大作用。一九四九年全省地方国营工厂共有二百二十九个，至一九五三年已经发展到二百四十八个了。这些工厂的总产值，已占该省国民经济总收入的百分之二十八点八二。
    黑龙江省地方国营工业的一个显著特点，是跟农业、牧畜业和副业生产的紧密配合，因而有力地支援了农牧业生产，巩固了工农联盟。该省地方国营第一机械厂，就是专为农业生产服务的。近三年来该厂制造的新式马拉农具，计有综合号铲趟机二万一千一百五十四台，双轮一铧犁四千台，镇压器二千台，这些农具已使用在农业生产上并为农民节省了大批的劳动力。比如综合号铲趟机，已在二十万垧土地上发挥了作用。按综合号铲趟机每作一垧地比旧式农具能节省两个劳动力，按铲趟两遍计算，那就节省八十万个劳动力。因为有了这些新式农具，农民便有可能把节省下来的劳动力用在其他生产方面。开通县五区九江窝棚村，去年便把剩余的劳力全部用在间苗，开苗和精耕细作上了，保证了多打粮食。在近两年内，全省有二万四千垧地，使用了双轮一铧犁进行秋翻地和随后实行宽播，平均每垧产量增加百分之十五左右。白城县岭下村就是使用两轮一铧犁得到好处的。岭下村去年共有七十垧地进行了秋翻和宽播。秋收后，每垧平均多打一石（四百五十斤）多粮。有十三垧高粱地共打八十三石，平均每垧打六石四斗，几乎超过常年三石六斗产量的一倍。农民都说：“人巧不如家伙妙，工人老大哥帮助我们多打了粮食。”
    第一机械厂的工人为了使新式农具更好地为农业生产服务，他们还到农村帮助农民修理机器，讲解使用方法。当他们到达海伦县十四区永合村孟庆余农业生产合作社时，受到农民们的热情欢迎。有人指着那一片茁壮的高粱说：“这片高粱长得这样好，是因为有了你们制造的铲趟机。”还有人感动地说：“过去，说工人是老大哥，我们还不大清楚，这回明白了，工人真是给咱们谋福利啊！”工人们在乡村时，也接受了农民提出的改进综合号铲趟机的意见。第一机械厂计划今年生产一万三千多台综合号铲趟机等质量更好的新式农具以供给农村的需要。
    嫩江、洮南、白城等县这一带，原有大批土碱、苇子，找不到销路。农民们把苇子当柴烧。自从地方国营第二火碱厂和第一造纸厂建设成以后，农民们再不用愁土碱和苇子的销路了。第二火碱厂每年需用一万多吨用土碱加工成的牙子碱。以每吨三十五万元计，一年便要付给农民三十九亿三千七百五十万元的款项。第二纸厂每年也要从农民手中购买四千三百六十吨苇子作造纸的原料。
    最近开工的红光制糖厂，又给农业生产带来了新的繁荣。这个工厂每年需用九万五千六百二十八吨甜菜。给讷河、依安地区的三千余户种植甜菜的农民解决了甜菜的销路问题。在一般情况下，种一垧甜菜，相等于三垧高粱的收入。依此计算农民们可以得到比种高粱多得八亿元的好处。因此农民们说：“这真是发展工业给咱们带来的好处啊！”
    工业的发展，对牧畜业发展也发生了巨大的影响。安达、肇东等地区是全省发展畜牧业的中心。仅安达县境内，就有牛六千七百多头，乳牛二千三百九十四头。有两千户农民靠养乳牛生活。但以前牛奶没有销路，每当夏季盛产牛奶的时候，私商就乘机压价，以致逼得农民用牛奶喂猪吃。去年，安达乳粉厂建成以后，就解决了牛奶的销路问题。乳粉厂现在每天可以加工鲜牛奶八千三百多斤，产乳粉一千八百七十余磅。这就使牧民们的收入大大增加。过去私商用八百元收买牧民们一公斤鲜牛奶，现在乳粉厂用二千四百元的价格收买。这样养一头乳牛，以每天平均产奶十公斤计算，一头乳牛一年就有三百万元的收入。安达地区的农民看见了养牛的好处。在去年十一月份当中，又买进来二百二十头乳牛。　（刘群）
