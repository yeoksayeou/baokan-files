A Problem Long Unresolved

　　After land reform in Chenjiazhuang Village, Datong County, Shanxi Province, most farmers experienced rapid production growth and improved living standards. However, some emancipated farmers saw slow progress, and a few even regressed. In the spring of 1952, 21 impoverished households lacked adequate clothing and food, accounting for over 14% of the village's total households. Five of these households had labor power but lacked production resources, with small plots of poor land yielding little grain, leading to worsening living conditions. Four households faced production and living difficulties, with labor power but lacking enthusiasm and losing faith in the future, some even becoming "good-for-nothings." Six households were orphaned, widowed, or lacked labor power, or had large families with few workers and low income. Another six households had lost their labor power due to disabilities. In 1952, the village's average grain yield was over 91 catties per mu, while these impoverished households' land averaged only 52 catties per mu. The village's average annual grain income was 780 catties per person, while impoverished households averaged less than 390 catties per person.

　　Failure to resolve the problems of impoverished households not only impacted the increase of overall social wealth but also burdened the state. In 1951, besides the village's mutual aid efforts, the state provided over 1,000 catties of relief grain and several dozen catties of cotton to seven or eight impoverished households. Despite state relief and the villagers' friendly assistance, some impoverished households still couldn't escape usurious loans, leading to the sale of furniture, livestock, labor, and land, reverting to the poverty of pre-land reform days. For example, Zhang Zhenhai, who worked as a hired hand for half his life, received land during land reform, but due to a large family and small landholding, his grain yield was insufficient, leading to annual spring famines and debt to wealthier households. Unable to repay the debt, he resorted to working off his debt, preventing him from cultivating his own land intensively, resulting in declining grain yields and increasing debt, ultimately relying on selling his labor for a living by 1951. Wang Longyuan was unable to work in the fields due to illness, and his possessions were nearly exhausted, even exchanging a large ox for a smaller one. This was detrimental to developing agricultural production. Continuing this way would widen the gap between the rich and poor, leading to a polarization of classes in rural areas.

　　The Chenjiazhuang Village branch of the Chinese Communist Party recognized this problem early on. In 1951 and 1952, with the development of mutual aid and cooperation movements in the village, the branch called on Party members and ordinary farmers to absorb impoverished households into mutual aid groups to achieve common prosperity. However, due to the weakness of mutual aid groups and the failure to effectively organize impoverished households in production, the approach focused on relief, such as cultivating land and providing grain, leading to dissatisfaction among some middle peasants and hindering the consolidation of the mutual aid groups. It also fostered dependency among some impoverished households, hindering their enthusiasm for participating in mutual aid production.

　　Impoverished Households Cannot Be Left Out of the Cooperative

　　In the spring of 1952, Chenjiazhuang piloted an agricultural production cooperative of 32 households, demonstrating greater advantages than mutual aid groups in various aspects. Therefore, after the autumn harvest and distribution that year, all 147 households in the village, except for a doctor and a stonemason, requested to join the cooperative. However, during the discussion about membership, some opposed admitting impoverished households. Some said, "We just established a good foundation last year, and absorbing impoverished households will exhaust us." Others said, "Joining the cooperative is good, but impoverished households will ruin it, and we'll have to support them for nothing." Even some Party members felt that impoverished households were a "burden," worrying that they would bankrupt the cooperative.

　　In response to this situation, the Chenjiazhuang Village branch of the Chinese Communist Party first convened branch committees and Party group meetings to discuss the issue of admitting impoverished households. In the discussion, everyone realized that the Party's advocated path of organizing was for the common prosperity of all farmers, and leading impoverished farmers forward was the glorious responsibility of Communist Party members. With unified thinking within the Party, Party members took an active role in promoting and leading in the research on admitting impoverished households.

　　Subsequently, mutual aid and friendly education were conducted among the masses of farmers through comparison and accounting methods. Besides promoting the principle of "everyone turning over together, everyone prospering together," concerns such as "fear of being burdened" and "fear of dragging down the cooperative" were addressed by calculating and comparing accounts to illustrate the benefits of admitting impoverished households. Everyone realized that leaving impoverished households out of the cooperative was not a viable solution. Driven by their livelihood, they would borrow money, sell labor, and sell land, and rural capitalism would take the opportunity to develop, leading to class differentiation in rural areas, making it difficult to consolidate the agricultural production cooperative. Allowing capitalism to develop in rural areas was a real harm to farmers.

　　At the same time, education on diligent production was also carried out for impoverished households requesting to join the cooperative. For example, Wang Cai, an impoverished household, originally wanted to be supported by others after joining the cooperative. After patient education by Party member Zhang Sheng, he realized that the cooperative mainly distributed according to labor, and only by working hard could he increase his income, and relying solely on the cooperative was wrong. After persuasion and education, many impoverished households made the promise of "working hard after joining the cooperative." This reassured those who were originally unwilling to admit impoverished households.

　　Solving the Problems of Impoverished Households by Starting with Organizing Production

　　The fundamental way for the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative to solve the problems of impoverished households was to leverage the advantages of agricultural production and solve their problems through organized production. Experience has proven that only by organizing agricultural cooperatives, especially larger ones, can problems of impoverished households be better solved, thereby preventing class differentiation in rural areas.

　　Under the leadership of the Party branch, the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative accepted the lessons of past failures of purely social relief. It first focused on organizing impoverished households to participate in agricultural production, incorporating the solution of their problems into every production activity throughout the year. During each production plan and labor allocation, it not only considered production needs and implemented planned employment but also adopted a household-by-household review method to ensure that everyone had work and could distribute more grain. Impoverished households were given priority for jobs they could handle. For example, Deng Fengxiu, a seventeen-year-old girl from an impoverished household, could only do light work. When delivering manure, others would filter the manure, she would dig it, others would drive the cart to haul the manure, and she would spread it. Initially, she couldn't even do these jobs well. Her cousin Deng Fengwu and production team leader Liu Yu patiently taught and helped her. Her production skills quickly improved, and she was able to keep up with an average male laborer. Wang Chunsheng, a cripple, initially couldn't do any work. Later, everyone considered that he could weed seedlings, so the production team leader would take him to the fields to weed every day during the summer hoeing season. This not only solved the problem of impoverished households participating in production but also freed up some strong laborers to do other more important work, increasing labor efficiency. When allocating labor, the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative also paid special attention to solving the living problems of impoverished households. For example, in August 1953, when the government mobilized migrant workers to work in Beijing, the agricultural cooperative specifically assigned Zhang Xinggui and Zhang Ping, two impoverished households, to go. As a result, they worked for over sixty days, earning over 900,000 yuan, solving their living problems before the autumn harvest distribution.

　　Secondly, the agricultural cooperative not only found ways to help impoverished households from the agricultural production aspect but also, based on the village's situation and the impoverished households' own conditions, sought solutions from various aspects such as animal husbandry and sideline occupations. For example, Wang Cai and Dai Yuyin from impoverished households, who were unable to participate in agricultural labor due to disabilities, were assigned by the agricultural cooperative to be responsible for cleaning the village streets (street sweeping was a system formed after the patriotic health campaign), and they were paid four work points per month. With the street sweeping work points and selling accumulated fertilizer, Wang Cai and Dai Yuyin each earned more than four dan of grain in a year. Wang Longyuan, who suffered from asthma, was also unable to participate in agricultural labor. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival in 1953, when the village supply and marketing cooperative wanted to make mooncakes, the agricultural cooperative mobilized him to pull the bellows, earning 170,000 yuan in wages. In the winter of 1952, the cooperative opened a tofu workshop and had the mothers and wives of impoverished households like Zhang Zhenhai grind tofu, earning one shi of millet in a winter. The greatest help for impoverished households was raising pigs. In the winter of 1952, the cooperative spent money to buy twenty piglets and distributed them to nineteen impoverished households to raise. It was stipulated that after the pigs grew up and were sold, the capital would be repaid. This alone earned the impoverished households 5.5 million yuan, and accumulated over one hundred carts of pig manure, earning manure money equivalent to over fourteen shi of grain. This was not only beneficial to the impoverished households but also to the cooperative.

　　Thirdly, under possible conditions, certain material assistance was given to the impoverished households to solve the problems that could not be solved from the production aspect. In the summer of 1953, the impoverished households again faced summer famine. Without helping them solve this problem, there would be no possibility of discussing future production and life. At this time, the agricultural cooperative mobilized households with surplus grain to lend them 41 shi of grain without interest, solving this difficulty. With the help of the cooperative, the impoverished households found production objects and also earned a lot of grain. However, there were still five impoverished households, such as Wang Cai and Dai Yuyin, who did not have enough to eat, short seventeen shi and six dou of grain a year. With the consent of all the cooperative members, the agricultural cooperative prepared to withdraw this portion of grain from the public welfare fund and lend it to them without interest (these seventeen shi and six dou of grain accounted for only 2.38 percent of the total income of the twenty-one impoverished households).

　　Why was the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative able to achieve such great results in solving the problems of impoverished households? This is because: First, the agricultural cooperative collectively managed the land and unified the allocation of labor, enabling each member to play a role. Strong laborers had work to do, and weak laborers were also not idle. Second, the cooperative was large, had strong strength, abundant capital, and many methods. In addition to solving problems from the agricultural aspect, it could also find ways for impoverished households from animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and other aspects. Third, the agricultural cooperative could promote mutual assistance and fraternity and give the impoverished households necessary economic support on the principle of not harming the interests of the general cooperative members.

　　Establishing the Ideology of Self-Reliance

　　In organizing impoverished households for production, the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative, in addition to continuously conducting mutual assistance and fraternity education to all cooperative members, paid special attention to educating and reforming the impoverished households themselves, overcoming their dependence, and educating them to establish a spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, and cultivating their labor habits and production abilities. For example, Dai Zeng, an impoverished household, was able to work, but in the past, because he had no production avenues, he lost confidence in the future and did not work hard. He spent all day going from house to house, and the villagers called him "Bai Diao" (free-loader). When he joined the cooperative, although he had made a "guarantee to work hard," he soon relapsed into his old habits. In order to thoroughly reform him, the agricultural cooperative ordered Party member Dai Yugui to lead him in labor and educate him. In daily production activities, Dai Yugui constantly carried out patriotism education and socialist future education to him, encouraging him to make progress, and explaining that relief grain was not easy to come by, and that no one would care if you starved to death in the old society. Now the agricultural cooperative wants to help you start a family and establish a career, and you should take this opportunity to become self-reliant. If you insist on lying down and relying on the agricultural cooperative, what way out do you have? In the past, Dai Zeng liked to sleep in late in the morning. Dai Yugui urged him to get up early every morning, and also took him with him when he was working. In this way, Dai Zeng slowly became aware and changed for the better. Later, he was also elected as the labor team leader by everyone. The agricultural cooperative also often used criticism and praise methods to inspire impoverished households to conduct self-education. Zhang Zhenhai worked well, so everyone elected him as a labor model. The cooperative also awarded him three chi of cloth, a fountain pen, and a diary. In the past, he could not read a word. Now he can record work and accounts, and has also become the reading group leader. Under the education and transformation of the cooperative, the enthusiasm for labor production of the impoverished households continued to rise. Facts have proved that the process of helping impoverished households produce and save themselves is also the process of educating and transforming them.

　　Organizing production on the basis of education and transformation, and adhering to self-reliance in production as the mainstay, supplemented by social support and relief, this is the basic policy of the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in solving the problems of impoverished households. As a result of doing so, first, the labor habits and production abilities of the impoverished households were tempered. Second, suitable production avenues were found, thus truly solving the problems of the impoverished households from the root. Third, the impoverished households were able to become self-reliant, and everyone was willing to help them. Facts have proved that only when the interests of the general cooperative members are not harmed, and mutual assistance and mutual benefit are achieved, can the impoverished households receive regular assistance from others. The result of purely social support and relief is that problems can never be solved.

　　Together Embarked on the Road to Common Prosperity

　　Under the help and leadership of the agricultural cooperative, all twenty-one impoverished households in Chenjiazhuang, like other farmers, have embarked on the road to common prosperity. As a result of the autumn harvest distribution in 1953, the total agricultural and sideline income of these twenty-one impoverished households reached more than 522 shi of grain. The average income per household was 24 shi and 8 dou. The average income per person was 6 shi and 6 dou, equivalent to 890 jin, which was two and a half times that of 1952. Most impoverished households not only achieved sufficient food and clothing but also began to have surplus grain. Among the twenty-one impoverished households, sixteen were no longer impoverished households, and the remaining five, with the loan assistance of the cooperative, did not lack food and clothing. In 1952, Chenjiazhuang still had thirty-five poor peasants, and in 1953, twenty-four households had risen to become middle peasants. Dai Zeng, who was called "Bai Diao" (free-loader) in the past, received 35 shi of grain in 1953. In the past, his mother had been living in her daughter's house in a neighboring village all year round because her son could not support her. Now she has also returned to the village. Because he was poor, Dai Zeng did not marry in the past, but now he is married. Dai Zeng often said: "The agricultural cooperative gave me a family and established a career; if it weren't for the agricultural cooperative, my bones would have been gnawed by dogs." His mother also often said: "If it weren't for the agricultural cooperative, I would never have been able to live in Chenjiazhuang Village for a few days in this life." Zhang Zhenhai, who had never had a good life for half of his life, is now living the best life. In 1953, his family was allocated 34 shi of grain, and there were three sheep lying in the pen. At present, he also wants to buy a cow. In the past, he could not afford new cotton-padded jackets and floral bedding, but now he is wearing and using them. Zhang Zhenhai said: "Land reform was a small liberation, joining the cooperative was a big liberation. You can't beat me out of the cooperative even with a stick." Zhang Laixi, 19, was a tragically orphaned child, whose original surname was Qin. His father could not support him, so he sent him to the Wang family. After the Wang's father died, he went with his mother to marry into the Zhang family. The villagers called him "Qin, Wang, Zhang." Later, his mother remarried again, and he became a lonely orphan. After joining the cooperative, he also found a home. In 1953, he was allocated 13 shi and 8 dou of grain. He said: "My life has been turned upside down, and my name must also be turned upside down." Therefore, he gave himself a new name that suited his heart called "Xinggui". The agricultural cooperative has brought happiness to everyone in Chenjiazhuang, and everyone in Chenjiazhuang loves it, and it is also more consolidated and developed on the basis of everyone's love.

    陈家庄农业生产合作社带领困难户走上了共同富裕的道路

    一个长期没有解决的问题
    山西省大同县陈家庄村土地改革以后，虽然大多数农民生产发展很快，生活也有了改善。但是，仍有部分翻身农民上升很慢，甚至还有少数下降。一九五二年春天，全村短衣缺食的困难农民还有二十一户，占全村总户数的百分之十四强。这些困难户中有五户有劳力，但缺乏生产资料，地少地坏，打粮不多，生活越过越紧；有四户生产和生活有困难，有劳动力但不积极劳动，对前途失去信心，有的甚至当了“二流子”；有六户孤寡无劳力或人口多，劳力少，收入少；还有六户因残疾丧失了劳动力。一九五二年，全村耕地平均每亩产九十一斤多粮，这些困难户的耕地平均每亩只产五十二斤。全村平均每人每年能收入七百八十斤粮食，而困难户平均每人每年还不到三百九十斤。
    困难户的问题得不到解决，不但影响到整个社会财富的增加，也给国家加重了负担。一九五一年，除本村通过互助互济的办法，帮助一部分困难户解决了困难以外，国家还给七、八家困难户发放了一千多斤救济粮和十几斤棉花。在国家救济和本村农民的友爱扶助下，有些困难户还是摆脱不了房利贷的剥削，以至卖家具、卖牲畜、卖劳力和卖高卖地，重新回复到土地改革以前的贫困地位。像当了半辈子长工的张振海，土地改革时分到了土地，但因家庭人口多，土地少，打粮不够吃，年年闹春荒，结果不得不向富裕户借债；借上债又还不了，只好用人工还债，这样就不能在自己的土地上加工细作，粮食一年比一年收得少，债务一年比一年重，到一九五一年就只好靠卖工生活了。王龙元因有病不能下地做活，家里能卖的东西已快卖光了，大牛也换成了小牛。这对发展农业生产是不利的。这样下去，贫的越贫，富的越富，又会造成农村阶级的两极分化。
    中共陈家庄村支部很早就注意到了这个问题，在一九五一年和一九五二年，随着全村互助合作运动的发展，支部就号召党员和一般农民吸收困难户参加互助，共同走上富裕的道路。但是由于互助组的力量单薄，同时又没有很好组织困难户参加生产，而是采取了以救济为主的做法，如给困难户代耕土地、救济粮食等等，结果不但引起了互助组内一些中农的不满，影响了互助组的巩固，同时也使某些困难户滋长了依赖思想，阻碍了他们参加互助生产的积极性的发挥。
      不能把困难户抛在社外
    一九五二年春天，陈家庄试办了一个三十二户的农业生产合作社，在各方面都表现了比互助组更大的优越性。因此，这年秋收分配后，全村一百四十七户，除一户医生，一户石匠外，全都要求入了社。可是在讨论入社时，有些人却反对吸收困难户入社。有的说：“我们刚打下一年的好基础，要把困难户吸收进来，非累坏不可。”有的说：“入社好是好，一有困难户就坏了，还得白白养活他们。”甚至有个别党员也觉着困难户是个“害”，耽心他们会把社拖垮了。
    针对着这个情况，中共陈家庄支部首先召开了支部委员会和党的小组会，讨论吸收困难户入社的问题，在讨论中，大家认识到：党所提倡的组织起来的道路，是让全体农民共同富裕的道路；带领困难农民一同前进，是共产党员的光荣责任。党内思想统一了，在研究吸收困难户入社的问题上，党员便起了积极宣传和带头作用。
    接着，又用对比、算账等办法，向农民群众进行了互助友爱教育。除宣传“要翻身大家翻身，要富裕大家富裕”的道理以外，还针对“怕受累赘”、“怕拉垮社”等思想顾虑，算账对比，说明了吸收困难户入社的好处。大家认识到把困难户留在社外，终究不是个办法。他们为生活所迫就要借债、卖工、卖地，农村资本主义就会趁机发展，农村阶级就会分化，农业生产合作社也就很难巩固。让资本主义在农村发展了，才真正是农民的一个大害。
    同时，对要求入社的困难户也进行了勤劳生产的教育。如困难户王才原来要求入社的动机就是想让大家白养活他，经过党员张升耐心教育，他认识到合作社主要是按劳取酬，入社后只有好好劳动才能增加收入，光依赖社是不对的。经过说服教育，许多困难户都作了“入社后一定努力生产”的保证。这样，原来不愿让困难户入社的人也就放心了。
    从组织生产入手解决困难户的
        问题
    陈家庄农业生产合作社解决困难户问题的根本办法，是发挥农业生产的优越性，通过组织生产，解决困难户的问题。经验证明，只有组织了农业社特别是较大的社，才能更好地帮助困难户解决问题，从而阻止农村的阶级分化。
    陈家庄农业生产合作社，在党支部的领导下，接受了过去单纯社会救济的失败教训，首先着重组织困难户参加了农业生产，把解决困难户的问题贯彻到常年的每个生产活动中。在每次计划生产支配劳力的时候，不只根据生产需要，实行有计划的用工，还采取了逐户审查的办法，做到人人有活干，人人能多分粮食。凡是困难户能干的活，就尽先让他们干。例如困难户邓凤秀是个十七岁的女孩子，只能干些轻活，在送粪的时候，就让别人滤粪，她刨粪，别人赶车拉粪，她上粪。开始她连这些活也干不好，她本家哥哥邓凤舞和生产小组长刘玉就耐心教导她，帮助她。这样她的生产技术很快就提高了，干起活来能够赶得上一个中等的男劳力。又如王春生是个跛子，开始什么活也不会干，后来大家考虑他锄苗子还能行，夏锄时生产小组长就每天带他下地锄苗子。这样，不但解决了困难户参加生产的问题，而且因为困难户参加了劳动，能够抽出了一部分劳动力强的人干其他更重要的活，提高了劳动效率。在支配劳动力时，陈家庄农业社还特别注意了解决困难户的生活问题，例如一九五三年八月，政府动员民工到北京做工，农业社就特别让困难户张兴贵、张平二人去做，结果他俩做了六十多天工，共赚回九十多万元，解决了秋收分配前的生活问题。
    其次，农业社不仅从农业生产方面给困难户找出路想办法，而且还根据本村情况和困难户本身的条件，从畜牧、副业等各个方面给困难户找出路想办法。例如困难户王才、戴玉银因身体残废，不能参加农业劳动，农业社就分配他们专门负责清扫全村街道（扫街是在爱国卫生运动后形成的一个制度），每月给他们计四个工。这样连扫街计工，带积肥卖钱，一年来，王才、戴玉银二人各收入了四石多粮食。王龙元是一个有喘病的人，也不能参加农业劳动，一九五三年中秋节前，本村供销社要烙月饼，农业社就动员他去拉风箱，赚了工资十七万元。一九五二年冬天社里开了一座豆腐坊，让困难户张振海的母亲和妻子推豆腐磨子，两个人一冬天赚了一石小米。帮助困难户解决问题最大的是养猪。一九五二年冬天社里出钱买了二十口小猪，分给十九家困难户喂养。规定等猪长大卖钱后，再还本钱。这一项，就使困难户收入了五百五十万元，同时还积了一百多车猪粪，赚了十四石多谷子的猪粪钱。这不仅对困难户有利，对社也有利。
    再次，是在可能条件下，给予困难户一定的实物帮助，解决他们从生产方面还解决不了的问题。一九五三年夏天，困难户又闹起夏荒来，不帮助他们解决这个问题，以后的生产生活都无从谈起，这时农业社就发动有余粮户，无利借给了他们四十一石粮食，解决了这个困难。在社的帮助下，困难户都找到了生产对象，因而也收入了很多粮食，但还有王才，戴玉银等五家困难户不够吃，一年一共还差十七石六斗粮食，经过全体社员同意，农业社准备从公益金里抽出这部分粮食无利借给他们（这十七石六斗粮食，不过占二十一家困难户全部收入的百分之二点三八）。
    为什么陈家庄农业社能够在解决困难户问题方面取得这样大的成绩呢？这是因为：第一，农业社集体经营土地，统一支配劳力，能够发挥每个社员的作用，劳力强的有活干，劳力弱的也闲不下来。第二，社大力量大，本钱厚、办法多，除从农业方面解决问题以外，还可以从牧畜、副业等方面给困难户找出路。第三，农业社可以在不损害一般社员利益的原则下，发扬互助友爱，给困难户以必要的经济支援。
      树立自力更生的思想
      在组织困难户生产中陈家庄农业生产合作社除继续不断地向全体社员进行互助友爱教育外，特别注意了对困难户本身进行教育改造，克服他们的依赖思想，教育他们树立自力更生的上进心，锻炼他们的劳动习惯和生产能力。如困难户戴增本来能劳动，但他过去因为没有生产门路，对前途失去信心，不好好劳动，整天东家走，西家串，村里人叫他做“白叼”。入社时他虽也曾做过“好好劳动的保证”，但入社不久又犯了老毛病。农业社为彻底改造他，就责成党员戴玉贵带领他劳动和教育他。戴玉贵在日常生产活动中，不断向他进行爱国主义教育和社会主义前途教育，鼓励他上进，并说明救济粮得来也不容易，要在旧社会饿死了有谁管，现在农业社要帮你成家立业，你应该趁这机会自立更生。你要硬是躺着不起来，靠倒农业社你还有啥出路？从前戴增早上好睡懒觉，戴玉贵每天早晨早早地就督促他起来，劳动的时候还带着他，这样戴增慢慢也就觉悟了，转变好了，后来还被大家选为劳动小组长。农业社还经常用批评和表扬的方法，启发困难户进行自我教育。张振海劳动好，大家就选他当劳动模范，社还奖给他三尺市布，一支水笔，一个日记本。从前他一字不识，现在能记工记账，还当上了读报组长。在社的教育改造下，困难户的劳动生产热情不断高涨。事实证明，帮助困难户生产自救的过程，同时也就是对困难户进行教育改造的过程。
    在组织生产中进行教育改造，在教育改造的基础上组织生产，坚持以生产自救为主，社会扶持救济为辅，这就是陈家庄农业社解决困难户问题的基本方针。这样做的结果，第一、锻炼了困难户的劳动习惯和生产能力。第二、找到了适宜的生产门路，因而真正从根本上解决了困难户的问题。第三、困难户能够自力更生了，大家也愿意帮他们。事实证明，只有在不损害一般社员利益的情况下，做到互助互利，困难户才有可能得到别人经常的帮助，单纯社会扶持救济的结果是永远解决不了问题的。
      一道走上了共同富裕的道路
    在农业社的帮助带领下，陈家庄全村二十一家困难户跟其他农民一样走上共同富裕的道路了。一九五三年秋收分配的结果，这二十一家困难户农副业总收入共达五百二十二石多粮食。每户平均收入二十四石八斗。每口人平均收入六石六斗，合八百九十斤，等于一九五二年的二倍半。大部困难户不仅作到了足衣足食，而且开始有了余粮。在二十一家困难户中，已有十六家不再是困难户了，其余五家，也在社的借贷帮助下，不缺吃穿。一九五二年陈家庄还有三十五户贫农，一九五三年已有二十四户上升为中农。过去被人们叫做“白叼”的戴增，一九五三年就分到了三十五石粮食。从前他的母亲因儿子养活不起，整年寄居在外村女儿家中，现在也回到村里来了。因为穷，戴增过去没有结婚，现在也结了婚。戴增常说：“农业社给我成了家，立了业；要不是农业社，我的骨头也让狗啃了。”他母亲也常说：“不是农业社，这辈子我别想再回陈家庄村住几天。”半辈子没过上一天好光景的张振海，现在光景过的最美。一九五三年他家分了三十四石粮，圈里也卧着三只羊了，目前他还想买一头牛；过去置不起新棉袄、花被窝，现在也穿上了，用上了。张振海说：“土地改革是个小翻身，入社是个大翻身，棒子打也别想把我打出社去了。”十九岁的张来喜是个身世凄惨的孩子，原来本姓秦，他爹养活不了，把他送给王家，姓王的父亲死后，他又随母亲出嫁到张家。村里人叫他是“秦、王、张”。以后他母亲又出嫁了，他就成了伶仃孤苦的流浪儿。入了社他也找到了归宿，一九五三年他分得了十三石八斗粮食。他说：“我生活翻了身，我的名字也得翻个身。”因此，他起了个合心的新名字叫“兴贵”。农业社给陈家庄每一个人都带来了幸福，陈家庄每一个人也都热爱它，它也在人人热爱的基础上更加巩固发展起来了。
