    Correct Work Attitude, Continuously Improve Work Efficiency
    —Reader's Letter Commentary
  　Liu Ye
    In the struggle to implement the general line of the state during the transition period, countless staff members in our state organs have steadfastly adhered to their work posts, striving to improve their theoretical, policy, and professional levels, continuously enhancing work efficiency, and ensuring the completion of state plans, fully demonstrating the excellent revolutionary qualities of serving the people. However, some organs still have staff members who lack a conscious work attitude, do not cherish working time, and even disrupt work order, causing incalculable losses to the state. Reader Yan Laoji wrote to say: The Trade Cooperation Section of the Credit Settlement Division of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China once had thirteen staff members. Due to the large number of people and the small amount of work, coupled with the very unserious work attitude of some personnel, work discipline was therefore very lax. Some people were late and left early, some read novels and ate snacks during work hours, and a few even pulled springs to "exercise" during work hours. People often started lengthy discussions over a trivial matter or an extremely simple sentence, covering everything from the north to the south. Some comrades are very dissatisfied with this phenomenon. Recently, the leadership has paid attention to rectification and has taken action; however, the ideological resistance among some staff members is still very strong. I hope the newspaper will criticize this.
    According to investigations and understanding, the situation revealed by the reader is true, and similar situations also exist in some units of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China. In order to rectify the labor discipline of the staff members, the leadership of the Beijing Branch conducted several inspections and education sessions on labor discipline in July and October of last year, and achieved certain results. However, due to the large number of people and the small amount of work in some units, work discipline is still lax. Furthermore, due to the lack of a serious and conscientious work attitude among some staff members, phenomena such as incorrect accounts, missed accounts, altered ledgers, and wrongly calculated interest, and remittances to wrong locations occur from time to time. Qin Quan, Jin Wujiao, and Zhang Yinzu, accountants at the Xidan office, had 316 wrong accounts in nine months; Yang Huiyuan of the Chongwai office paid 5 million yuan instead of 500 yuan when making payments; and Zhang Fenglan of the Dongsi office paid 14 million yuan instead of 1.4 million yuan. In order to continue the struggle against this unhealthy trend, the Beijing Branch is paying attention to conducting general education for all staff members through the comparison of good and bad examples, so as to establish a new work attitude among staff members, and then improve various systems such as attendance and performance appraisal, and encourage staff members to improve work efficiency. This approach by the Beijing Branch is very necessary.
  According to feedback from many readers, lax labor discipline also exists in some other organs. Although this phenomenon occurs in a small number of staff members, the situation is serious.
    Why do some staff members in organs have the above-mentioned extremely unserious work attitude? First of all, it is because some staff members have not yet established a new conscious work attitude. They bring the laissez-faire of the petty bourgeoisie and the decadent style of the bourgeoisie into the state organs, infecting the staff members of the state organs. Secondly, there are also serious defects in the leadership of the organs. Some leaders have adopted a compromising and tolerant attitude towards the phenomenon of unserious work attitude and the disruption of work systems; some leaders are satisfied with formulating system clauses, thinking that everything will be fine once there are systems, and lack strict control and inspection of how the work systems are implemented. There are also individual leading cadres who not only fail to lead by example and strictly abide by the systems, but also take the lead in playing around. For example, leading cadres in a certain sub-bureau of the Shanghai Post Office sing Peking Opera and dance with individual cadres with poor work attitudes during work hours.
    In addition, the laxity of labor discipline in organs is also related to the less-than-reasonable labor organization in the organs. If the phenomenon of overstaffing in an organ is not resolved in a timely manner, it will of course lead to idle work and lax discipline. This point must also be corrected.
    Some people think that organs are different from factories, and there is no need to emphasize labor discipline; some people also think that leading organs are different from grassroots work departments and "cannot be as busy as those below." These views are obviously incorrect. The construction work of our country requires that every work link is in line with the needs of the entire construction work. The continuous improvement of the work efficiency of state organs is an indispensable and important force for the entire construction work. Any phenomenon of lax labor discipline that affects the improvement of work efficiency cannot be tolerated. The fact that higher-level organs are "not as busy as those below" is only a phenomenon manifested by the different work responsibilities they should shoulder, and does not mean that higher-level organs have nothing to do, and do not need to study their business and think about their work, so as to understand the situation and problems below, and provide timely and appropriate solutions.
    In order to effectively implement the general line of the state during the transition period, we hope that leading cadres and all staff members of various organs will criticize the phenomenon of lax discipline, establish a conscious work attitude as masters of their own affairs, and continuously improve work efficiency.

### 端正工作态度，不断地提高工作效率

    端正工作态度，不断地提高工作效率
    ——读者来信述评
  　刘野
    在贯彻国家过渡时期的总路线的斗争中，我们国家机关中的无数工作人员都坚守着自己的工作岗位，努力提高理论、政策和业务水平，不断地提高工作效率，保证国家计划的完成，充分表现了为人民服务的优秀的革命品质。但是，有的机关里仍然存在着这样的工作人员：他们缺乏自觉的工作态度，不爱惜工作时间，甚至破坏工作秩序，给国家造成无法估量的损失。读者严劳纪来信说：中国人民银行北京分行信贷结算科贸易合作股曾经有工作人员十三人，因为人多事少，加上部分人员工作态度很不严肃，工作纪律因而非常松弛。有的人迟到早退，有的人在工作时间看小说、吃点心，个别人有时还在工作时间拉簧子“锻炼身体”。人们有时常常因为一件小事或一句极其简单的话，就引起一阵高谈阔论，内容是天南地北无所不包。对于这种现象有些同志很不满意。近来，上级领导方面已经注意整顿，并作了处理；但是某些工作人员中的思想抵触还是很大。希望报纸给予批评。
    根据调查了解，读者所揭发的情况是真实的，类似这种情况，在中国人民银行北京分行的部分单位中也是存在的。北京分行领导方面为了整顿机关工作人员的劳动纪律，曾在去年七月和十月间先后进行过几次劳动纪律的检查与教育，并且获得了一定的效果。但某些单位确因人多事少，工作纪律仍然松弛。更由于某些工作人员缺乏严肃认真的工作态度，工作上的错账、漏账、涂改账簿、错计利息，汇款汇错地点等现象时有发生。西单办事处会计员秦权、金无骄、张荫祖三人在九个月中曾错账三一六笔；崇外办事处杨惠源在付款时把五○○元付成五○○万元；东四办事处张凤兰把一四○万元付成一四○○万元。为了继续和这种不良倾向作斗争，北京分行正注意通过好坏事例的对比对全行工作人员进行普遍的教育，使工作人员树立新的工作态度，并进而健全考勤、考绩等各项制度，鼓励工作人员提高工作效率。北京分行这种作法是十分必要的。
  根据许多读者来信反映，劳动纪律松弛，在其他一些机关中也同样存在。这种现象虽然是产生在少数工作人员的身上，但情况是严重的。
    为什么某些机关工作人员存在着上述极不严肃的工作态度呢？首先是由于部分工作人员还没有树立新的自觉的工作态度，他们把小资产阶级自由散漫和资产阶级腐朽的作风带到国家机关中来，浸染着国家机关的工作人员。其次，机关领导方面也存在着严重的缺陷。有的领导者对工作态度不严肃、破坏工作制度的现象，采取了迁就、姑息的态度；也有的领导者满足于制订制度条文，认为有了制度就万事大吉了，对工作制度的执行如何，则缺乏严格的掌握和检查。还有个别的领导干部不仅不能以身作则，严守制度，反而带头玩闹。如上海邮局某分局领导干部在工作时间和个别工作态度不好的干部一起唱京戏、跳舞等。
    此外，机关劳动纪律的松弛是和机关的劳动组织不尽合理也是有关的。如果某个机关人浮于事的现象不予及时解决，当然也会形成工作清闲，纪律松弛。这一点，也必须注意纠正。
    有些人认为机关和工厂不一样，没有必要强调劳动纪律；也有些人认为领导机关和基层工作部门不一样，“不能像下边那样忙忙碌碌”。这些看法显然都是不正确的。我们国家的建设工作，要求每一个工作环节都切合整个建设工作的需要，国家机关工作效率的不断提高，是整个建设工作不可缺少的重要力量，任何劳动纪律松弛、影响提高工作效率的现象，都是不能容许的。上边机关的“不像下边那样忙忙碌碌”，只是应负工作责任不同所表现出的一种现象，并不等于上边就无事可作，不需要钻研业务，思考工作，来了解下边的情况和问题，予以及时的恰当的解决。
    为了切实贯彻国家过渡时期的总路线，我们希望各机关领导干部和所有工作人员都来批评那种纪律松弛的现象，树立自觉的主人翁的工作态度，不断地提高工作效率。
