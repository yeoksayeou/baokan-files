　　Glorious Fighters, Skilled Producers
　　"I must become a skilled producer!"
　　"For the cause of peace, I was once a glorious fighter; for the construction of the motherland, I must also become a skilled producer." Since the day Liu Shurui left the army to engage in industrial production, he has been practicing his promise.
　　In May 1952, Liu Shurui transferred from the army to the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory to work. Mastering a production skill was not without its difficulties for a soldier accustomed to holding a gun. Initially, Liu Shurui worked in Song Ben'en's group in the passenger car workshop. Due to his unfamiliarity with the technology, he once broke a wall panel, affecting the production of the entire group, which made him feel sad. Since then, he has worked hard to learn and initially mastered general production techniques.
　　In August 1953, the factory administration decided that the passenger car workshop of the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory would be transformed from repairing to manufacturing hard-seat sleeper cars. He was transferred to lead the floor frame production group. This was a new task, and the phenomenon of incorrect or missing purlin installation often occurred during the production process. Liu Shurui was very uneasy. He thought: Our group is responsible for the first process, which is like laying the foundation for building a house. Poor installation of the floor frame will not only affect the life of the passenger car, but also easily cause accidents. In order to change this production situation, he invited the old worker Li Yaoxiao to his group to introduce production experience to the workers and improve their production knowledge. At the same time, he mobilized everyone to study the technology. He often studied and improved production with the old workers in his spare time. The group also established an inspection system to ensure quality standards. Therefore, since last October, there has not been a single "redo," and the production task has been overfulfilled every month.
　　Liu Shurui often paid attention to inspiring the workers' political enthusiasm, improving their work enthusiasm, and overcoming conservative ideas. When formulating the production plan for the first quarter of last year, some workers were unwilling to put forward advanced production plans. Liu Shurui used the heroic and exemplary deeds of the volunteers to educate and encourage everyone. He said to his fellow workers: "If we can produce a large number of good locomotives to strengthen railway transportation, wouldn't we be supporting the volunteers?" After listening to him, the old worker Wang Qidong criticized his conservative thinking, saying: "When I originally made plans, I always wanted to hold back a little, thinking it would be safer this way. This time I realized that this kind of thinking is wrong." Many workers expressed their willingness to learn from the volunteers' spirit of hard work and their noble qualities of fighting for the people.
　　Liu Shurui fully practiced his promise in his work. On January 21 this year, he was named a model worker. (Ye Yu)
　　Turning Grassland into Pasture
　　Twenty miles west of Bailingmiao in Darhan Muminggan United Banner, Ulanqab League, there is a vast grassland. Deep in the grassland, several yellow earthen houses are faintly visible. Here live the members of an animal husbandry mutual aid team. The members of the mutual aid team were all brave soldiers who participated in the liberation struggle of the people of Inner Mongolia. When they were transferred from the army to engage in production here, the local government lent each person three horses, ten cows, and thirty sheep; in addition, they also issued timber for building houses, as well as carts, pots, bowls, ladles, basins and other furniture.
　　The grassland was originally barren, but after the mutual aid team appeared, it became lively: houses were built, and a cattle pen was also built. Herds of cattle and sheep live peacefully on the grassland. Old women are happily raising lambs.
　　The mutual aid team has formulated many methods, such as recording work points on time, democratically evaluating work, negotiating prices, and compensating or supplementing work according to work points. Because the system is reasonable, the team members' production enthusiasm is very high. The livestock are growing so strong. Nearby herdsmen often travel from hundreds of miles away to learn from the production experience of the mutual aid team. It has become a good example for herdsmen in Ulanqab League to move towards mutual aid and cooperation.
　　Hua Guishan Became the Director of an Agricultural Production Cooperative
　　In July 1952, Hua Guishan returned from the army to Shengxing Village in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province. Originally, the masses cultivated more than two qing of land for him. As soon as he arrived home, he proposed to cultivate it himself; at the same time, he joined the Zhao Xing mutual aid team. Hua Guishan is a man with great ideals. After joining the team, he often promoted the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives to the mutual aid team members. In January 1953, the Zhao Xing mutual aid team was transformed into an agricultural production cooperative, and Hua Guishan was elected by everyone as the director of the cooperative.
　　In production, Hua Guishan often educates and encourages the members to move forward. In the autumn of 1953, some members developed slack thinking and were unwilling to dig the ground together, only caring about their own work. At this time, Hua Guishan organized the members to study the heroic deeds of the hero Huang Jiguang, so that the members realized that selfishness is a shameful idea. In this way, all the members who could work went to the fields; Grandma Zhang, who had poor eyesight and could not participate in production, automatically took care of the children for everyone, allowing the mothers who could work to go to the fields to work.
　　Hua Guishan has established a high prestige among the masses in the year or so since he returned to his hometown, and is supported and loved by the masses. In the two production competitions in the society, he was selected as a model member. Under his leadership, the production of the entire society last year was also better than the local mutual aid teams. The seven qing of wheat, which was planted with new agricultural tools, evenly spaced and densely planted, yielded an average of more than 2,700 jin per qing, which was twice as much as the wheat fields of ordinary mutual aid teams.
　　Zhang Rongguang Was Elected as a Model
　　At the representative meeting of revolutionary army dependents, returned soldiers, and preferential treatment models in Licheng County, Shandong, veteran soldier Zhang Rongguang was elected as a model. Zhang Rongguang is 31 years old this year. He returned to his hometown from the army in April 1952 to participate in agricultural production. As a poor peasant, he closely linked himself with the local government and people as soon as he returned to his hometown. He often remembered what the leaders of the army said: "The enemy with guns has been eliminated, but the enemy without guns still exists." He usually paid attention to the activities of bad people in the village. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, he reported five counter-revolutionaries to the government, and the people elected him as the township security director.
　　Jiangjiagou Village, where Comrade Zhang Rongguang is located, is close to the Yellow River. Last autumn, it rained continuously, and the water level of the Yellow River rose day by day, and the masses were uneasy. Zhang Rongguang guarded the river embankment day and night. During the most tense period, he did not close his eyes for more than ten consecutive days. At the flood prevention work meeting, he was rated as a flood prevention model by the masses.
　　"We've Elected a Good Township Head This Time!"
　　The exemplary deeds of veteran soldier Li Zhengqing are circulating in the Jidong County area of Shandong Province. Li Zhengqing is from Nantancun Village in Jidong County. He was injured and became disabled in the People's Liberation War. In 1952, he returned to his hometown to participate in agricultural production. Li Zhengqing and his mother had difficulties in production. But he thought: Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. After returning home, he used the grain and cash subsidies he brought back from the army to purchase agricultural tools. In 1953, under the leadership of the Party, he organized a mutual aid team. Because the farming was timely and the fertilizer was sufficient, a bumper harvest was achieved in the autumn of that year. Four points of millet yielded 130 jin, and eight points of corn yielded 400 jin. Comrade Li Zhengqing is not afraid of difficulties and loves labor, and has established prestige among the masses. People praised: "People's Liberation Army soldiers are heroes in the front, and they are also skilled workers on the production front." In the general election, the masses unanimously elected him as the township head. Recently, when transporting public grain, although he was disabled and inconvenient to move, he still rushed to push the cart and transported the grain to the grain bureau's warehouse with the masses. On the way, he warmly took care of the masses. Everyone reflected: "We've elected a good township head this time!"

### 光荣的战士，生产的能手

　　光荣的战士，生产的能手
    “我一定要做一个生产能手！”
    “为了和平事业，我曾经做了一个光荣的战士；为了祖国建设，我也一定要做一个生产能手。”柳树瑞自离开部队从事工业生产那天起，就一直在实践着自己的诺言。
    一九五二年五月，柳树瑞从部队转到青岛四方机车车辆制造厂做工。掌握一门生产技术，这对于一个习惯于拿枪的战士来说，不是没有困难的。开始时柳树瑞在客车场宋本恩小组做工，因技术不熟练，他有一次弄断了墙板木，影响到整个小组的生产，这曾使他感到难过。从此，他就努力学习，初步掌握了一般的生产技术。
    一九五三年八月，工厂行政方面决定，四方机车车辆制造厂客车场由修理转为制造硬席卧车。他被调去领导地板骨架生产小组。这是一个新任务，在生产过程中常发生错装或漏装承木的现象，柳树瑞心里很不安，他想：我们组所担负的是第一道工序，这好比盖房子打地基一样，安装不好地板骨架，不但会影响客车的寿命，而且容易发生事故。为了改变这种生产情况，他请老工人李姚孝到他组里，给工人介绍生产经验，提高工人的生产知识。同时，他发动大伙研究技术。他在业余时间经常和老工人研究，改进生产。小组还建立了检查制度，来保证质量标准。因此，从去年十月到现在，没有一件“返手活”，每个月都能超额完成生产任务。
    柳树瑞经常注意启发工人的政治积极性，提高他们的劳动热情，克服保守思想。在去年制订第一季度生产计划时，有些工人不愿提出先进的生产计划，柳树瑞就用志愿军的英雄模范事迹教育大家，鼓舞大家。他对工友说：“如果我们能生产大量的好的机车，来加强铁路运输，不就支援了志愿军吗？”老工人王起东在听了他的话后，批判了自己的保守思想，说：“我原先订计划时总是要留一手，心想这样保险些。这回我认识到，这种思想是不对的。”许多工人都表示要学习志愿军那种艰苦奋斗的精神和为人民而战的崇高品质。
    柳树瑞在劳动中完全实践了自己的诺言。今年一月二十一日，他被评为劳动模范。　（叶予）
    把草滩变成牧场
    在乌兰察布盟达茂联合旗百灵庙西二十华里的地方，有一片广阔的草滩。草滩深处，隐现着几座黄色的土房。在这里，住着一个牧业互助组的组员们。互助组的组员们过去都是英勇的战士，曾参加过内蒙古人民的解放斗争。他们由部队转到这里投入生产的时候，当地政府贷给每人三匹马、十条牛、三十只羊；此外，还发给了盖房用的木料，以及大车和锅、碗、瓢、盆等家具。
    草滩原是一片荒凉，互助组出现以后，这里就有了生气：房屋盖起来了，还修筑了一座牛圈。成群的牛、羊，安详地在草原上生活着。老婆婆在愉快地抚养着羊羔。
    互助组订出了按时记工，民主评工、议价，按工偿款或补工等许多办法。因为制度合理，组员们的生产情绪很高。牲畜都长得那么肥壮。附近的牧民经常远从百里路以外赶到这里，学习互助组的生产经验。它成为乌兰察布盟牧民走向互助合作的好榜样。
    华桂山当了农业生产合作社主任
    在一九五二年七月间，华桂山由部队回到了黑龙江省克山县的胜兴村。原来群众给他代耕两垧多地，他一到家里，就提议自己耕种；同时，他参加了赵兴相互助组。华桂山是个有远大理想的人，在他入组后就经常向互助组员宣传农业生产合作社的好处。一九五三年一月间，赵兴相互助组转为农业生产合作社，华桂山被大家推选为合作社的主任。
    在生产中，华桂山经常教育社员，鼓励他们前进。一九五三年秋季，有些社员产生了松劲思想，不愿合伙铲地，光顾自己的活。这时，华桂山就组织社员学习英雄黄继光的英勇事迹，使社员们认识到自私自利是一种可耻的思想。这样，能劳动的社员都下了地；眼力不好、不能参加生产的张老太太自动给大家带孩子，让能劳动的母亲下地做活。
    华桂山回乡一年多来，已在群众中树立了很高的威信，受到群众的拥护和爱戴。在社内两次生产评比中，他被选为模范社员。在他领导下，去年全社的生产也比当地互助组搞的好，七垧用新式农具平播密植的小麦，平均每垧打了二千七百多斤，比一般互助组的麦田增产一倍。
    张荣广当选了模范
    在山东历城县烈军属、回乡军人、优抚模范代表会议上，转业军人张荣广同志当选了模范。张荣广今年三十一岁，在一九五二年四月由部队回乡参加农业生产。这个贫农出身的人，一回到家乡，就和当地的政府和人民紧密地联系起来。他经常记着部队首长的话：“拿枪的敌人虽然被消灭了，但不拿枪的敌人依然存在。”他平常在村里经常注意坏人的活动情况，在镇压反革命期间，他曾向政府检举了五个反革命分子，人民把他推选为乡治安主任。
    张荣广同志所在的江家沟村，紧靠着黄河。去年秋天，霪雨连绵，黄河水位连日上涨，群众情绪不安。张荣广日日夜夜在河堤上守护。在最紧张的期间，他连续有十几天没有合眼。在防汛工作会议上，他被群众评为防汛模范。
    “这回可选了个好乡长！”
    在山东省即东县一带流传着转业军人李正清的模范事迹。李正清是即东县南坦村人，在人民解放战争中，他负了伤，成了残废。一九五二年，他回乡参加农业生产。李正清和他母亲俩，在生产上不是没有困难的。但是他想：在党和毛主席的领导下，没有克服不了的困难。回家后他把从部队带回来的生产资助粮现款，购买了农具。一九五三年他在党的领导下组织了互助组。因耕作及时，肥料充足，当年秋季得到了丰收，四分地谷子打了一百三十斤，八分地包米打了四百斤。李正清同志不怕困难，热爱劳动，在群众中建立了威信。人们都赞扬着：“人民解放军战士在前方是英雄，在生产战线上又是能手。”在普选中，群众一致推选他当乡长。最近在运送公粮时，他虽然身体残废，行动不方便，还是争着推车子，和群众一起把粮食送到粮食局的仓库里。路上，他热情地照顾群众。大家都反映：“这回可选了个好乡长！”
