Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 5th: Chairman Thimayya, Lieutenant General of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, acknowledged that the US side sent secret agents of the Li and Chiang Kai-shek gangs to infiltrate the Tongjang-ni POW camp, using terror tactics to prevent POWs from listening to explanations and applying for repatriation.

According to a report by Agence France-Presse journalist Georges Gallienne, Thimayya stated in an interview with him on the 2nd regarding the situation in Tongjang-ni: "I am certain that those who are gradually becoming leaders are from Taiwan and South Korea." He said, "There have been many riots and several murders there." He also said that he had spoken to many POWs, some of whom told him that regardless of the characters tattooed on their bodies, "they still want to go home."

Thimayya also spoke to Gallienne about some examples of illegal activities carried out by the US side "from outside the camp, such as attempts to smuggle radios inside bags of wheat, which he said were sent by the United Nations; in addition, there were radio broadcasts carried out by the United Nations' psychological warfare propaganda team." He added that after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission requested this "psychological warfare propaganda team" to leave, the US side "continued to carry out illegal activities in different ways. He said that nurses on the UN side in the hospital were found 'passing letters from POWs', and that a South Korean POW who had escaped was found trying to hide a letter from an anti-communist group in Seoul in his hat to take back to his camp."

Thimayya spoke to Gallienne about the situation in the Songgok-ni POW camp, saying that in this POW camp, "no evidence of coercion was seen." He said that more than two hundred South Korean POWs "calmly went to listen to the explanations. There have never been any disturbances in the POW camp. We have not heard of any violence, nor have any murders occurred." Regarding the American POW Batcheler, who was repatriated on the 1st, he said: "I saw him as soon as he came out, before anyone else had spoken to him. He told me that he did not encounter any difficulties in leaving the POWs he was with, and that anyone among them could do the same as he did."

    中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅向外国记者发表谈话
    指出美方派遣特务混入营场阻止战俘遣返
   【新华社开城五日电】中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将承认美方派遣李、蒋匪帮的特务混入东场里战俘营，用恐怖手段阻止战俘听取解释和申请遣返。
    据法新社记者乔治·加利安报道，蒂迈雅在二日接见他时谈到东场里的情况说：“我肯定，那些渐渐成为领袖的人是从台湾和南朝鲜来的”。他说，“那里曾发生过许多次暴动和好几次谋杀事件”。他还说，他和很多战俘谈了话，有些人对他说，不管他们身上被刺满了字，“他们还是要回家”。
    蒂迈雅还对加利安谈到一些美方“从营场外面进行非法活动的例子，如企图在小麦袋内私运无线电机的事件，据他说，这个小麦袋是由联合国方面送来的；此外还有联合国的心理战宣传队进行的无线电广播。”他又说：在中立国遣返委员会要求这个“心理战宣传队”离开以后，美方“继续以不同的方式来进行非法活动，他说，曾发现医院中的联军方面的护士‘从战俘手中接递信件’，并且说，曾发现有一名逃掉的南朝鲜战俘企图把一封汉城的反共团的信件藏在帽子里带回他的营场中去。”
    蒂迈雅对加利安谈到松谷里战俘营的情况说：在这个战俘营中，“看不到任何运用胁迫的证据”。他说，二百多名南朝鲜战俘“曾经很镇静地走去听取解释。战俘营中从未发生过任何骚动。我们没有听到过任何暴力行为，也没有发生过谋杀事件。”他谈到一日遣返的美国战俘巴契勒时说：“我在他一出来之后，在别人都还没有对他说过话时就看到了他。他告诉我说，他在离开与他在一起的战俘时，没有遇到任何困难，他们之中的任何人都可以照他那样做。”
