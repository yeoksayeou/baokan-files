Local industry in Northwest China achieved significant development in 1953. Comparing the output of several major products of local state-owned and joint state-private enterprises with 1952: flour increased by 74%, cotton yarn increased by 165%, cotton cloth increased by 420%, blue bricks increased by 589%, coal increased by 36%, and electricity increased by 16%.

The development of local industrial production in Northwest China has further met the growing needs of the people of Northwest China for means of production and means of livelihood, as well as the needs of industrial construction. For example, the flour produced by the flour industry in one year can provide more than 10 million people with food for a month; the fine cloth produced by textile factories in one year can provide more than 8.2 million people with enough fabric to make a set of clothes each; the blue bricks produced by brick and tile factories in one year can build more than 28,500 ordinary houses. Due to the development of production, the proportion of various economic components in local industry has also undergone significant changes. The proportion of local state-owned industry increased from 17.1% in 1952 to 24.58% in 1953, the proportion of cooperative-run industry increased from 2.54% to 3.6%, the proportion of joint state-private industry increased from 25.27% to 26.92%, and the proportion of private industry decreased relatively from 55.09% in 1952 to 44.9%.

The Party and government leading organs in Northwest China attach great importance to giving play to the positive role of local industry in the national economy. In the past year, the Party and government leading organs have successively organized various work groups to go deep into various factories and mines to inspect and help with the work.

Since September last year, a campaign for increasing production and practicing economy has been widely carried out in local state-owned and joint state-private factories and mines in Northwest China. During the campaign, most factories and mines implemented the policy of combining increasing production and practicing economy with improving business management, initially strengthened planned management, and established various responsibility systems. Factories and mines with a better foundation and larger scale have also formulated work plans for workshops and teams, specific measures to complete the plans, and personal guarantee covenants. Some have formulated instruction charts to turn plans into action programs for employees. After implementing the work plan and establishing instruction charts, the Lanzhou Flour Mill achieved a production balance rate of 96.7% in November last year. The Xinqin Textile Factory strengthened planned management in the installation project and implemented team work plans, completing the plan 20 days ahead of schedule.

In the campaign for increasing production and practicing economy, employees have brought into play their enthusiasm and creativity, and rationalization proposals and inventions have emerged continuously. Outstanding examples include: workers at the Datong Coal Mine improved the hand drill, increasing the efficiency of drilling holes by four times; the Xi'an No. 1 Brick and Tile Factory improved the new type of mold, reducing the number of tile repair workers per vehicle by seven; workers at the Xinqin Power Plant created a new "casing push-pull" tool in the process of repairing the small gear shaft of the old motor, increasing efficiency by ten times; Yao Shiwen, an apprentice at the Xinjiang Machine Factory, improved the screw stamping die, increasing work efficiency by five times; the Tianshui Power Plant adopted nine rationalization proposals from workers, saving 77 million yuan worth of wealth throughout the year, which can generate more than 29,000 additional kilowatt-hours of electricity. In the campaign for increasing production and practicing economy, various factories and mines also paid attention to organizing employees to learn and promote many advanced experiences, such as the "front-end flour extraction method" in the flour industry (some factories are learning the "bran removal first method"), the "longwall mining method," "rapid tunneling," and "deep groove, deep hole" working methods in the coal mining industry, the advanced experiences of "adjusting load" and "seepage slag burning" in the power industry, and the "multi-tool multi-blade" working method in the machinery industry, etc. Due to the promotion of these advanced experiences, the potential capacity of enterprises has been greatly tapped. According to the statistics of 58 local state-owned factories and mines, labor productivity has increased by an average of 32.6%.

    西北区地方工业去年有显著发展
    西北区地方工业一九五三年有显著的发展。地方国营、公私合营工业的几种主要产品产量与一九五二年的比较：面粉增加了百分之七十四，棉纱增加了百分之一百六十五，棉布增加了百分之四百二十，青砖增加了百分之五百八十九，煤增加了百分之三十六，电增加了百分之一十六。
    西北区地方工业生产的发展，进一步满足了西北人民对生产资料和生活资料日益增长的需要，以及工业建设的需要。如面粉工业一年来所生产的面粉，可供给一千多万人吃一个月；纺织厂一年来生产的细布，能供八百二十多万人每人缝制一套衣服；砖瓦厂一年来生产的青砖，可盖普通住房二万八千五百多间。由于生产的发展，地方工业中各种经济的比重也起了显著的变化。地方国营工业所占比重由一九五二年的百分之一十七点一增至一九五三年的二十四点五八，合作社营工业所占比重由二点五四增至三点六，公私合营工业所占比重由二十五点二七增至二十六点九二，私营工业所占比重由一九五二年的百分之五十五点零九相对减为四十四点九。
    西北区党、政领导机关对发挥地方工业在国民经济中的积极作用，极为重视。去年一年中，党、政领导机关先后组织了各种工作组深入各厂矿检查和帮助工作。
    去年九月份起，西北区地方国营和公私合营厂矿普遍开展了增产节约运动。在运动中，大部分厂矿都贯彻了增产节约与改善经营管理相结合的方针，初步加强了计划管理，建立了各种责任制度。基础较好、规模较大的厂矿，并订出了车间、小组的作业计划和完成计划的具体措施以及个人的保证公约。有的制订了指示图表，使计划变成职工的行动纲领。兰州面粉厂在推行作业计划、建立指示图表后，去年十一月份生产均衡率达到百分之九十六点七。新秦纺织厂在安装工程中加强了计划管理，推行了小组作业计划，提前二十天完成了计划。
    在增产节约运动中，职工们发挥了积极性和创造性，合理化建议和创造发明不断涌现。突出的有：大通煤矿工人改进手摇钻，打眼效率提高四倍；西安市第一砖瓦厂改进新型模子，每台车减少修瓦工七人；新秦电厂工人在检修旧电机小牙齿轴的过程中，创造了“套壳推拉”的新工具，提高效率十倍；新疆机器厂学徒姚世文改进螺丝压型模子，提高工作效率五倍；天水电厂采纳了工人的九件合理化建议，全年节约价值七千七百万元的财富，可多发电二万九千多度。在增产节约运动中，各厂矿还注意组织职工学习和推行了许多先进经验，如面粉业的“前路出粉法”（部分工厂正在学习“先去麸皮法”），煤矿业中的“长壁式采煤法”、“快速掘进”和“深槽、深眼”工作法，电力工业中的“调整负荷”、“渗水烧渣”的先进经验，机器业中的“多刀多刃”工作法等等。由于这些先进经验的推广，大大发掘了企业潜在能力。根据五十八个地方国营厂矿的统计，劳动生产率平均提高了百分之三十二点六。
