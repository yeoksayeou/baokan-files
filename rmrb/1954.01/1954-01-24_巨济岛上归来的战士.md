    A Warrior Returns from Geoje Island
    Jin Feng
    
    I
    
    Song Mozhen returned from Geoje Island.
    
    He stood on the scaffolding of a building on Moranbong Hill in Pyongyang, holding a bricklaying trowel in his hand. The October sun cast his tall figure diagonally on the half-finished brick wall he had just built. Just a month ago, he was still enduring inhuman torture on that island of death. Now, he has not only returned to the warm embrace of his motherland, but also stands on the scaffolding creating the future happiness of his country.
    
    Five, ten, fifteen… He quickly counted, but there were still only two hundred and fifty bricks. And the quitting-time whistle had already sounded.
    
    "Model warrior Comrade Zheng Shixue laid one thousand two hundred bricks today," the loudspeaker on the construction site reported the day's achievements.
    
    Song Mozhen couldn't help slowing down his pace, his heart also becoming heavy.
    
    II
    
    Twelve o'clock had passed, and Song Mozhen was still lying in bed with his eyes open. He was thinking about the guarantee he made at the conference of returning personnel: "To dedicate all strength to the motherland, to build a more beautiful Pyongyang, a more prosperous motherland with my labor."
    
    Three days had passed, and it was still two hundred and fifty bricks, while Zheng Shixue laid one thousand two hundred!
    
    He gently turned over, feeling sore all over.
    
    "Damn electric torture, what have they done to me? In the past, this little work wouldn't have tired me out?" Then, scenes from the past flashed in his mind.
    
    A small village in Gunsan County, South Korea, thirty years of tenant farming, the ravages of Japan, the oppression of the United States, the liberation of Gunsan in July 1950, the retreat of the People's Army soon after, his own enlistment, capture in October, and being sent to Busan, and then transferred to Geoje Island.
    
    Here, he met his captured brother-in-law, who brought him tragic news and also increased his strength to fight. His whole family: his mother, elder brother, sister-in-law, and wife were all killed by the Li Chengwan bandit army, and a seven-year-old daughter was missing.
    
    The inhuman life on the island, their unyielding struggle. The demonstrations from March 18 to 21, 1952, the cutting off of food supplies from March 29 to April 1, and then the Dudd incident on May 7 that shook the world, and he was the warrior who captured Dudd alive.
    
    Thinking of this, Song Mozhen couldn't help smiling happily; he remembered Dudd's terrified face when he was captured, he remembered that group of frightened, stupid guards. He remembered Dudd's trial, Dudd's confession, Colson's signature, and Dudd's release. As he thought, Song Mozhen frowned, because then the United States tore up the agreement, and the terror of Bonner's time came; on June 10, machine guns, cannons, tanks, and paratroopers attacked the unarmed prisoners of war, killing and wounding more than five hundred prisoners, but they still did not yield.
    
    He was captured and tortured.
    
    "You captured the commander of the prisoner-of-war camp, isn't that a violation of discipline?" The horse-faced American judge began to interrogate him.
    
    "The commander of the prisoner-of-war camp massacred prisoners of war in large numbers, isn't that a violation of international law?" He asked calmly.
    
    "No need to ask that, answer my question." The horse-face lengthened, looking like a stupid donkey.
    
    "If you don't answer, I can't answer either." He himself didn't know where this calm strength came from.
    
    Electricity passed through his body, and he fainted. He was tortured eight times in a month, and fainted eight times.
    
    Every time he was carried back to the room, Zheng Jingkai, the slender and kind Zheng Jingkai, immediately massaged him with his swollen hands. Late at night, he often told him stories about his revolutionary work in China and his imprisonment by the Kuomintang, the history of the Chinese Communist Party's struggle, and many moving events of the Chinese revolution during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War.
    
    How these nightly stories educated him!
    
    There were also many other comrades who he could not forget. Song Ri, who had stayed in Korea to carry out revolutionary work, had been in Japanese prison for eight years, the longest he went without food was seven days, and his stories of struggle in prison were truly moving! And then there was Park Shangxuan, who had stayed in the Soviet Union for a long time, and his stories of Soviet socialist life made him yearn for it so much! And it was him, even thinner than Zheng Jingkai, who was once made to stand with his hands raised for two hundred and forty hours - a full ten days and nights! Not allowed to sleep or rest, four secret agents took turns beating him. Finally, he completely collapsed, but the first words he said when he woke up were: "I will not say anything."
    
    "To persevere is to win," Zheng Jingkai often used this sentence to encourage him. They persevered, and they won.
    
    On September 6, 1953, they finally returned to the motherland. When they arrived in Kaesong, the welcoming crowd, the warm greetings, the warm smiles… He didn't want to cry, but tears welled up.
    
    Motherland, you are so warm, so lovely; without the motherland, where would we be today, but how can we repay the motherland? Two hundred and fifty bricks a day! He thought again of this troubling number.
    
    Thinking of this, he couldn't sleep anymore. He quietly got up and went outside.
    
    Outside was a hazy moonlight, shining on the extended iron arm of the crane, shining on the brick wall he had built during the day. Song Mozhen picked up some small pieces of wood and made a model of a brick, and immediately started to build. He groped and built the most difficult corner of the brick wall over and over again. The distant cockcrow awakened his fatigue, and he hurried to take off his clothes and lie down. As soon as he closed his eyes, the reveille sounded.
    
    III
    
    A month later, on the Moranbong construction site, the sky was getting dark, and Song Mozhen was nervously and skillfully building the corner of the brick wall.
    
    "Cement, cement!" the warrior on the scaffolding above him shouted. Song Mozhen's corner was already built, and he quickly ran down and carried three bags of cement up at once.
    
    "What great strength!" the warrior greeted him with a smile.
    
    He didn't say a word, and went down and carried six more bags up.
    
    The warrior on the scaffolding was so surprised that he couldn't speak, and couldn't help but ask him: "Ah! Comrade, where did you get such great strength?"
    
    Song Mozhen, sweating, paused for a moment and replied:
    
    "Love for my homeland has given me twice the strength, and hatred for the enemy has given me another twice the strength. Now, for the sake of our beloved motherland, young man, you just wait and see, I will use double the strength."
    
    At this moment, the quitting-time whistle sounded, and along with the whistle, the following exciting news was broadcast from the loudspeaker: "Comrade Song Mozhen, a returning person, laid one thousand five hundred bricks today." (Attached picture)

    巨济岛上归来的战士
    金凤
    一
    宋模镇从巨济岛上归来了。
    他站在平壤牡丹峰的建筑架上，手里拿着砌砖的泥刀。十月的阳光把他高大的身影斜投在刚砌成的半截砖墙上。一个月以前，他还在那死亡岛上忍受着人间的非刑。现在，他不仅回到祖国温暖的怀抱，而且站到创造祖国未来幸福的建筑架上来了。
    五块、十块、十五块……他迅速地数着，依然还只有两百五十块。而下工的哨子已经响起来了。
    “模范战士郑仕学同志，今天一天砌砖一千二百块。”工地上的扩音器报告着一天的成绩。
    宋模镇不由得放慢了脚步，心也跟着沉重起来。
    二
    十二点钟敲过了，宋模镇还睁着眼睛，躺在床上。他想着自己在归来人员代表大会上所做的保证：“要把一切力气献给祖国，要用自己的劳动建设更美丽的平壤，更富强的祖国。”
    三天过去了，还是两百五十块，人家郑仕学是一千二百块！
    他轻轻翻了一下身，只觉得浑身酸痛。
    “该死的电刑，把我整成什么样啦。从前，这一点活还能累着？”于是，往事一幕一幕地在他的脑海里浮现出来。
    南朝鲜群山县的一个小村庄，三十年的雇农生活，日本的蹂躏，美国的压迫，一九五○年七月群山的解放，不久，人民军的撤退，自己的参军，十月被俘、被押送到釜山，又被转到巨济岛。
    在这里，他碰到了被俘的内弟，给他带来了惨痛的消息，也给他增加了斗争的力量，他的全家：母亲、哥哥、嫂嫂和妻子都被李承晚匪军杀死了，一个七岁的小女儿不知下落。
    岛上非人的生活，他们不屈的斗争。一九五二年三月十八日到二十一日的示威游行，三月二十九日到四月一日的断绝粮食供应，然后是五月七日震动全世界的杜德事件，而自己就是活捉杜德的战士。
    想到这里，宋模镇不由得愉快地微笑起来；他想起了杜德被抓住时那副怕死的惊惶的脸，他想起了那一群吓昏了的愚蠢的卫兵。他想起了杜德的受审，杜德的认罪，柯尔生的签字，杜德的释放。想着想着宋模镇皱起了眉头，因为接着美国撕毁了协议，波纳恐怖时期来了；六月十日，机枪、大炮、坦克，还有降落伞部队，向手无寸铁的战俘进攻，战俘们死伤五百多人，但仍然没有屈服。
    他被抓去拷问了。
    “你抓了战俘营长官，是不是违犯了纪律？”那个马脸的美国军法官开始对他审问。
    “战俘营长官大批屠杀战俘，是不是违反国际公法？”他不慌不忙地反问。
    “不用问这个，回答我的问话。”马脸拉长起来，简直像个蠢驴。
    “你不回答，我也不能回答。”他自己也不知道那里来的这股镇定的力量。
    电流通过全身，他昏过去了。一个月拷问了八次，昏了八次。
    每次被抬回到房里，郑京开，就是那个身材瘦小和蔼可亲的郑京开，马上用自己发肿的双手给他按摩。夜深了，常常给他讲自己在中国参加革命工作和被国民党抓去坐监的故事，讲中国共产党的斗争历史，讲抗日战争时期和解放战争时期中国革命的很多动人事迹。
    这些夜间的故事，是怎样教育着他呵！
    还有其他很多同志，也使他不能忘记。宋日，那个一直留在朝鲜干革命工作的宋日，他在日本鬼子的监牢里坐了八年，挨饿最多的一次是七天，他在监牢里斗争的故事真是感动人啊！还有那个在苏联待了很久的朴尚铉，他讲的苏联社会主义的生活使他多么向往啊！而就是他，比郑京开还要瘦小的他，一次被举起手站了二百四十小时——整整十昼夜！不让睡觉，也不让休息，四个特务轮班的打他。最后他完全昏倒了，可是，他醒过来第一句话就是：“我什么也不说。”
    “能坚持就是胜利。”郑京开常常用这句话鼓舞他。他们坚持下来了，他们胜利了。
    一九五三年九月六日，他们毕竟回到祖国来了。到了开城，那欢迎的人群，热情的慰问，温暖的笑……他心里很不愿意哭，眼泪却涌出来了。
    祖国呵，你是多么温暖，多么可爱；没有祖国，那有今天，可是，用什么来报答祖国呢？一天砌砖二百五十块！他又想起了这个使他苦恼的数目字。
    想到这里，再也睡不着了。他悄悄爬了起来，走到外面。
    外面是一片朦胧的月色，照着起重机那伸长的铁臂，照着他白天砌的砖墙，宋模镇拣了一些小木头片回来，做起砖的模型，立即动手砌起来。最难砌的砖墙的转角地方，他摸索着砌了一遍又一遍。远远的鸡啼唤起了他的疲劳，他才赶忙脱了衣服睡下。才一阖眼，起床号就响了。
    三
      一个月以后，在牡丹峰建筑工地上，天色近晚了，宋模镇正紧张而又熟练地砌那砖墙的转角。
      “水泥，水泥！”在他头上建筑架上的战士这样叫着。宋模镇的转角已经砌好了，他连忙跑下去，一次扛了三袋水泥上来。
    “好大的力气呀！”那个战士笑着招呼他。
    他一声不响，下去又扛了六袋上来。
    站在架子上的战士惊异得说不出话来，不由得问他：“啊！同志，你那里来这样大的力气？”
    流着汗的宋模镇怔了一下回答：
    “对乡土的爱给了我一倍力气，对敌人的恨又给了我一倍力气。现在，为了亲爱的祖国，小伙子你等着看，我要使出双倍的力气来。”
    就在这时，下工的哨音响了，随着哨音从扩音器中播出这样令人振奋的消息：“归来人员宋模镇同志今天砌砖一千五百块。”（附图片）
