    This is Gongga Peak in the famous Daxue Mountains of Xikang Province, 7,700 meters above sea level, covered with snow all year round. During the Long March of 25,000 li, the Red Army crossed the Daxue Mountains and reached Yan'an, the sacred place of the Chinese people's revolution. This photo was taken by the Forest Aviation Survey Team at an altitude of 5,500 meters, 40 kilometers away from Gongga Peak.

　　我们伟大的祖国
    这是西康省著名的大雪山脉的贡嘎峰，拔海七千七百公尺，终年积雪不化。红军二万五千里长征时，曾越过了大雪山脉，到达中国人民革命的圣地——延安。这是由森林航空视察队在五千五百公尺高空距贡嘎峰四十公里拍摄的照片。
