Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: With the General Line gradually taking root in the hearts of the people in the vast countryside, the quantity of surplus grain sold by peasants has increased sharply. In November 1953, the amount of grain purchased nationwide reached the highest monthly level in the past four years. In December, the amount of grain purchased by the state exceeded this level by 77.88 percent.

Currently, the movement to publicize the General Line and educate peasants to sell surplus grain is developing extensively and in depth in various regions. In the East China region, the provinces are combining the purchase of grain with the arrangement of production and the development of mutual aid and cooperation, based on the requirement that 90 percent of the peasants in rural areas receive education on the General Line. Large numbers of cadres are working with the peasants in the countryside to calculate "emancipation accounts," formulate grain sales plans, and "chart production blueprints." In the Northeast region, inspired by the General Line, peasants are highly enthusiastic about selling grain. By the end of December last year, the region had completed 80.18 percent of the state grain purchase plan. In Jilin Province, 3,000 reporters, 50,000 propagandists, and 100,000 activists are working among the masses. In Heilongjiang Province, 2,200 cadres from 34 counties are also scattered in more than 1,490 villages, educating peasants to sell surplus grain to support industrial construction. By the end of last year, the province had completed 78.29 percent of its grain purchase plan. In the Central South region, the amount of grain purchased in the first ten days of December last year doubled compared with the same period in November. In Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces, peasants in seven counties, two cities, and more than 2,600 townships have delivered the grain they sold to warehouses, and peasants in another 29 counties and 3,260 townships are delivering grain to warehouses. In Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, a collective grain delivery upsurge has begun. The grain-selling teams, carrying banners that read "Support the country's socialist construction," are converging on the grain purchasing stations in a mighty stream. In the Southwest region, Sichuan Province has made relatively rapid progress in grain purchase work, and the province's state grain purchase plan was completed by the end of December last year. Local Party and government departments have strengthened their leadership over peasants' collective grain sales and safe storage. At present, in Shanxi Province in the North China region, the surplus grain that peasants have pre-booked to sell already accounts for 99 percent of the province's grain purchase plan. By the end of November last year, 984 agricultural production cooperatives in the Changzhi area had collectively sold more than 4 million jin of grain as units. In Hebei Province, the work of educating peasants to sell grain is being carried out in depth. Shaanxi Province is the main grain-producing area in Northwest China, and nearly 10,000 agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the province took the lead in selling surplus grain, which played a great role in promoting grain sales by peasants throughout the province.

According to relevant departments, with the publicity and education of the General Line gradually taking root in the hearts of the people, in January, the broad masses of peasants will deliver a large amount of their surplus grain to state granaries. A large-scale movement of selling and delivering grain is gradually unfolding in rural areas across the country. Party and government departments in various regions have begun to strengthen the organization of grain purchase and transportation work.

    广大农民在总路线的鼓舞下积极售粮
    全国收购粮食的数量急剧增加
   【新华社十二日讯】随着总路线在广大农村逐渐深入民心，农民出售余粮的数量急剧增加。一九五三年十一月份全国收购粮食的数量已达到四年来每月购粮的最高水平，十二月份国家购粮的数量又超过这个水平百分之七十七点八八。
    目前，各地宣传总路线和教育农民出售余粮运动，正在广泛地深入地发展。华东区各省在要求农村百分之九十的农民受到总路线教育的基础上，把收购粮食和安排生产、发展互助合作工作结合起来进行，大批干部正在农村和农民一道算“翻身账”，订售粮计划，“打生产谱”。东北区农民在总路线的鼓舞下，售粮热情高涨。到去年十二月底，全区已完成国家购粮计划百分之八十点一八。吉林省有三千名报告员、五万名宣传员和十万名积极分子在群众中活动。黑龙江省三十四个县中，也有两千二百多名干部散布在一千四百九十多个村庄，教育农民出售余粮支援工业建设。该省的购粮计划，到去年年底止，已完成百分之七十八点二九。中南区去年十二月上旬购粮数量比十一月同期增加了一倍。江西、湖南、湖北三省有七县、二市、两千六百多个乡的农民已把出售的粮食送入仓库，另有二十九个县三千二百六十个乡的农民正在送粮入仓。湖南省平江县已展开集体送粮的热潮，卖粮的队伍打着“支持国家社会主义建设”的旗帜，浩浩荡荡聚向购粮站。西南区以四川省购粮工作进展较快，该省国家购粮计划在去年十二月底已经完成。当地党和政府部门已加强了对农民集体卖粮、安全入库的领导工作。目前，华北区山西省农民预定出售的余粮，已占全省购粮计划百分之九十九。长治专区有九百八十四个农业生产合作社到去年十一月底，以社为单位，已集体售粮四百多万斤。河北省教育农民售粮的工作正在深入进行。陕西省是大西北的主要产粮区，该省近万个农业生产互助合作组织带头出售余粮，对推动全省农民售粮起了很大作用。
    据有关部门预计，在总路线的宣传教育已逐渐深入民心的情况下，一月份内，广大农民将把他们出售的大批余粮，送入国家粮库。一个大规模地卖粮、送粮的运动，正在全国农村逐渐展开。各地党和政府部门已开始加强收购和运粮的组织工作。
