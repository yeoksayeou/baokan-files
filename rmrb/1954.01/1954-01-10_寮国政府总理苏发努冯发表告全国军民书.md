Xinhua News Agency, Vientiane, January 8th: Laotian Resistance Government Prime Minister Souphanouvong, in a New Year's Day letter to the Laotian military and civilians, said: 1953 was a year of remarkable achievements for the Laotian people. We have won successive brilliant victories this year. Our liberated areas are expanding and consolidating day by day, and our army is growing stronger day by day. The achievement of these successes is due to the close unity of our military and civilians around the Laotian Resistance Government and the Lao Free National United Front, and their resolute struggle against the French imperialist aggressors and traitors; at the same time, it is also due to the full sympathy and support of the fraternal people of Vietnam and Cambodia and the peace-loving and democratic people of the world for our people's just struggle.

The letter to the military and civilians said: In order to achieve new achievements in 1954, our military and civilians must advance the war of resistance, increase production, and establish and stabilize the newly liberated areas. At the same time, I hope that the military and civilians will complete your tasks so that our war of resistance will move towards complete victory.

    寮国政府总理苏发努冯发表告全国军民书
    【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社寮国八日讯：寮国抗战政府总理苏发努冯在一九五四年元旦发表告寮国军民书说：一九五三年是寮国人民取得卓越成就的一年。我们在这一年中接连赢得了辉煌的胜利。我们的解放区正在日益扩大和巩固，我们的军队正在日益壮大。这些成就的取得，是由于我们的军民紧密地团结在寮国抗战政府和寮国自由民族统一战线的周围，为反对法国帝国主义侵略者和卖国贼而进行了坚决的斗争；同时也是由于我国人民的正义斗争得到了越南、高棉两国兄弟人民及全世界爱好和平与民主的人民的充分同情和支持。
    告军民书说：为了在一九五四年取得新的成就，我们的军民必须推进抗战，增加生产，建立和稳定新解放区。同时，我希望军民完成你们的任务，使我们的抗战走向完全的胜利。
