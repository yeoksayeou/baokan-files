Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 18th: The Southwest region will pilot more than 3,400 agricultural production cooperatives this year. This spring, more than 900 will be piloted first in areas with a relatively good foundation in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, as demonstrations and to create experience in running cooperatives. Provinces have also formulated specific plans for the development of mutual aid teams based on different conditions. This year, the number of farm households participating in mutual aid teams in the Southwest region will reach 40 to 60 percent of the total number of farm households. Among them, there will be a significant increase in year-round mutual aid teams. Sichuan Province requires that 1.7 million households participate in year-round mutual aid teams, accounting for 33 percent of the total number of households organized.

After being educated on the general line of the state's transition period, farmers in various parts of the Southwest region have generally increased their enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation. The CCP committees at all levels in the Southwest, based on the demands and possible conditions of the farmers, have decided to actively pilot agricultural production cooperatives this year, develop and improve mutual aid teams, and vigorously strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. At present, Sichuan and Xikang provinces have convened mutual aid and cooperation conferences, and Guizhou Province has also convened a provincial agricultural production cooperative work conference. Many special districts and counties have also convened or are convening mutual aid and cooperation representative conferences, and are holding training classes for leading cadres in mutual aid and cooperation. In the training class held in Suining Special District, Sichuan Province, more than 800 people participated in the study. Yunnan Province will also train more than 40,000 mutual aid team leaders and active farmers. Various places have exchanged experiences in the mutual aid and cooperation movement at the mutual aid and cooperation representative conferences and mutual aid team leader conferences, creating conditions for the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    各省根据不同条件订出发展互助组的计划
    【新华社重庆十八日电】西南区今年将试办三千四百多个农业生产合作社。今春将在互助合作运动有较好基础的地区先试办九百多个，作为示范和创造办社经验。各省对发展互助组的工作也都根据不同的条件订出了具体计划。今年西南区各省参加互助组的农户，将分别达到总农户数的百分之四十到六十。其中常年互助组将有显著增加。四川省要求参加常年互助组的农户达到一百七十万户，占组织起来的总农户数百分之三十三。
    西南区各地农民经过国家过渡时期总路线的教育后，互助合作积极性普遍提高。中共西南各级党委依据农民的要求和可能条件，决定在今年积极试办农业生产合作社，发展和提高互助组，大力加强对互助合作运动的领导。现在，四川、西康两省已召开了互助合作会议，贵州省也召开了全省的农业生产合作社工作会议。许多专区和县也已召开或正在召开互助合作代表会议，举办训练互助合作领导骨干的训练班。四川省遂宁专区举办的训练班，参加学习的人即有八百多人。云南省也将训练互助组长和农民积极分子四万多人。各地在互助合作代表会议和互助组长会上，交流了互助合作运动的经验，为互助合作运动的发展创造了条件。
