Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 23rd: The All-India Peace Council has decided to hold an "Oppose the U.S.-Pakistan Military Treaty Day" on February 14th.

According to the Indian Information Service, the Municipal Committee of Ambala City in East Punjab Province, India, also passed a resolution strongly condemning the proposed U.S.-Pakistan military treaty, because "this treaty will not only bring war to India's doorstep but will also pose a threat to world peace." The resolution also stated that the United States arming Pakistan is an attempt to undermine relations between India and Pakistan and further complicate the Kashmir issue.

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: According to the Indian Information Service quoting the Indian Press Trust, Sardar Surjit Singh Majithia, Deputy Minister of Defense of the Indian government, spoke at a public rally in Amritsar on the 19th protesting the planned U.S. military "aid" to Pakistan. He said that it is unwise for any Asian country to provide the United States with bases and bring war to peaceful regions. He said that India will be fully prepared to deal with any foreign aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: According to the Indian Information Service, Iraqi and Indonesian public opinion continues to condemn the proposed U.S.-Pakistan military treaty.

The Baghdad newspaper "Al-Akbar Masa’i" in Iraq recently published an article saying, "The United States is not spending money to protect the Pakistani people, but to realize its ambition of obtaining military bases," thereby benefiting from the new war it is trying to provoke. The newspaper pointed out, "The aid given by the United States is of no benefit to weak countries, but it is of great benefit to the Americans." "American aid means the infiltration of imperialism, spreading decadent ideas and chaotic emotions, disturbing people's hearts, and transferring all or part of the power to the Americans. We welcome aid with good intentions and friendship. However, if aid comes at the expense of our freedom, happiness, and independence, then no patriotic person will want such aid."

In another commentary, "Al-Akbar Masa’i" spoke about the United States providing this kind of "aid" to weak countries, saying: "Enlightened minds will never be influenced by the naive tricks of the United States. They will see through the distorted logic of American policy and the ridiculous illusion of imperialism hoping to drive all countries into a Third World War."

The Jakarta newspaper "Sumber" in Indonesia said: Pakistan "is now rashly embarking on a path whose future is unpredictable, which is very regrettable. After careful consideration, Pakistan will regret the hasty steps it is currently taking." The newspaper pointed out that Pakistani Prime Minister's insistence that the aid is purely to strengthen Pakistan's defenses "proves to be untenable."

    印度将在二月举行“反对美巴军事条约日”
    伊拉克和印尼舆论谴责美巴军事同盟
    【新华社新德里二十三日电】全印和平理事会决定于二月十四日举行“反对美巴军事条约日”。
    又据印度新闻处消息：印度东旁遮普省的翁巴拉市市政委员会也通过决议严厉谴责拟订中的美巴军事条约，因为“这个条约不仅会把战争带到印度门前，并将造成对世界和平的威胁”。决议还说：美国武装巴基斯坦是企图破坏印度和巴基斯坦之间的关系，并使克什米尔问题更加复杂。
   【新华社二十三日讯】据印度新闻处引印度报业托辣斯消息：印度政府国防部副部长萨达尔·苏吉特·辛格·马吉蒂亚，十九日在阿姆利则一个抗议策划中的美国给予巴基斯坦军事“援助”的公众集会上发表演说。他说：对于任何一个亚洲国家来说，供给美国以基地并把战争引到和平地区都是不明智的。他说：印度将充分准备应付任何来自外国的侵略。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据印度新闻处报道：伊拉克和印度尼西亚舆论继续谴责拟订中的美巴军事条约。
    伊拉克首都巴格达的“阿克巴尔·马萨伊报”最近发表文章说：“美国花钱并不是爱护巴基斯坦人民，而是要实现它获得军事基地的野心，”从而在它所企图挑起的新战争中得到利益。该报指出：“美国给予的援助对于弱小国家毫无好处，但是对于美国人却有很大的好处。”“美国的援助意味着帝国主义的渗入，散布腐朽思想和纷乱情绪，扰乱人心，并把权力全部或一部分转移到美国人手中。我们欢迎具有好意与友善精神的援助。但是，如果援助要以我们的自由、幸福与独立作代价，那么，凡是爱国的人都不会要这种援助的。”
    “阿克巴尔·马萨伊报”在另一篇评论中谈到美国对弱小国家进行这种“援助”时说：“开明的思想是决不会受美国的幼稚诡计的影响的。他们将会看穿美国政策的歪曲逻辑，以及帝国主义希望驱使所有国家进行第三次世界大战的可笑幻想。”
    印尼首都雅加达的“泉源报”说：巴基斯坦“现在轻率地进行一项前途未可预卜的事，这是非常令人遗憾的。巴基斯坦冷静考虑之后将会懊悔它目前采取的仓促步骤”。该报指出：巴基斯坦总理硬说援助纯然是为了加强巴基斯坦的防务，这句话“证明是站不住脚的”。
