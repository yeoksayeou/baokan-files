Factory Workers in Flour Mills, Rice Mills, etc., Actively Improve Production and Save a Large Amount of Grain

In the production increase and economy campaign, workers in flour mills, rice mills, and other light industry factories in various regions have come up with various methods to increase the rice yield from paddy, sorghum, and the flour yield from wheat, as well as to use substitutes, saving a large amount of grain for the country.

After the launch of the production increase and economy campaign, Jin Tianmin, a technician at the local state-owned Shijiazhuang Flour Mill, with the support of the leadership and the help of the workers, successfully experimented with the "bran-first milling method." After the three local state-owned flour mills in Shijiazhuang adopted this method, each hundred catties of wheat can produce five more catties of flour, and the quality is even better than before. As a result, these three factories can produce more than ten million catties of flour annually. This innovation has attracted the attention of workers in flour mills in Zhangjiakou, Tongxian, Baoding, Handan, and other regions, and many flour mills are currently promoting or preparing to promote this method. Workers at the Qingdao Flour Mill responded to the call for increased production and economy by modifying "standard flour," which is both nutritious and saves the state a large amount of grain. According to statistics on flour processing by the city's Grain Bureau from January to September last year, if processed according to the new standards, the wheat saved would be enough for 130,000 people to eat for a month. Workers at the Shenyang No. 2 Rice Mill implemented a method of separating large and small sorghum grains for processing, reducing losses and producing an additional 162,000 kilograms of rice per month. According to the results of increasing the rice yield from paddy and the flour yield from wheat by grain department employees in the four major cities of Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, and Kunming, more than 1.7 million catties of rice and more than 228,000 catties of flour can be saved each month. Workers in various rice mills in Tianjin have universally promoted the "three diligences" (diligently checking machines, diligently cleaning up soil grain, diligently checking samples) and "three cleans" (clean return grain, clean brown rice, clean fine rice) to increase the rice yield from paddy, raising the rice yield from 88 catties of clean rice per hundred catties of brown rice to 92 catties.

At the same time, many brewery workers in various regions, in order to save the state a large amount of grain, have adopted substitutes to replace grain for brewing. Most state-owned and local state-owned wineries in Shandong Province have switched to using sweet potato slices, soft jujubes, and persimmons for winemaking, saving more than 140 million catties of grain annually. According to a survey by the China Monopoly Corporation in Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces, there are many varieties of non-grain brewing raw materials. If some substitutes are used for winemaking, preliminary statistics show that the grain saved each year is roughly equivalent to the annual grain needs of nearly one million people. After the Ulanhot Winery in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region adopted the experience of the Shenyang State-owned Winery in using bran and wheat bran to make koji, it not only saved grain but also increased the wine yield by 14.8 percent. Now, eleven state-owned wineries in Inner Mongolia are preparing to promote this experience, which will save approximately 6.6 million catties of grain annually, as well as saving funds and reducing costs by more than 500 million yuan. The State-owned Tianjin Winery successfully experimented with using fresh sweet potatoes for winemaking at the end of October last year; the Anguo Winery in Hebei used yam slices for winemaking in the fourth quarter of last year, saving more than 990,000 catties of grain; the Tongxian Prefecture winemaking industry tried using sweet potato slices for winemaking in November, saving one million catties of grain; and the Luzhou Winery in Sichuan has also adopted tomatoes for winemaking. In addition, workers in many regional wineries have actively adopted various non-grain raw materials produced locally for winemaking and have achieved great results.

In textile factories, many factories have also adopted substitutes for the flour used for sizing yarn. For example, the Shijiazhuang Textile Factory uses sweet potato flour for sizing yarn, which has significantly improved the quality of the cloth, and it is estimated that it can save more than 250,000 catties of flour annually. Xin Ziliang, a sizing worker at the joint state-private Xinghua Weaving Factory in Weifang City, Shandong Province, created a method of using alum for sizing yarn, which can also improve the quality of the cloth, and has now been promoted in more than 50 weaving factories and many household weaving businesses in the city.

    各地面粉厂、机米厂等厂职工
    积极改进生产节约了大量粮食
    在增产节约运动中，各地面粉厂、制米厂和其他若干轻工业工厂的职工，想出各种办法，提高稻谷、高粱的出米率和小麦的出粉率以及采用代用品，为国家增产节约了大量粮食。
    增产节约运动开展后，地方国营石家庄面粉厂技师金天民，在领导上的支持与职工们的帮助下，试验“先出麸皮制粉法”成功，石家庄地方国营的三个面粉厂采用了此法后，每百斤小麦可多出五斤面粉，质量比前还好。这三个厂全年因此可多出面粉一千多万斤。这一创造，已引起了张家口、通县、保定、邯郸等地面粉工厂职工们的重视，目前已有很多面粉厂正在推广或准备推广这一方法。青岛市面粉厂的工人响应增产节约号召，改制“标准粉”，既富于营养，又给国家节省了大批粮食。据该市粮食局去年一至九月的面粉加工数字的统计，如按新的标准加工，所节省下来的小麦，就足够十三万人吃一个月。沈阳第二制米厂工人实行大、小粒高粱分开的分粒加工制米法后，减少了损耗，每月可多出米十六万二千公斤。据重庆、成都、贵阳、昆明四大城市粮食部门职工提高稻谷出米率和小麦出粉率的结果，每月即可节约大米一百七十多万斤，节约面粉二十二万八千多斤。天津市各机米厂职工为提高稻谷出米率，普遍推行了“三勤”（勤检查机器、勤打扫土粮、勤对样子）、“三净”（回路稻谷净、糙米净、细米净）的办法，出米率都由过去每百斤糙米出净米八十八斤提高到九十二斤。
    与此同时，各地有很多酿酒厂的职工，为了能使国家节约大量粮食，都纷纷采用代用品代替粮食来制酒。山东省大部分国营和地方国营酿酒厂都改用地瓜干、软枣、柿子制酒，全年可节省粮食一亿四千多万斤。据中国专卖事业公司在广东、广西、浙江、江苏四省的调查证明，非粮食酿酒原料品种很多，如果用部分代用品制酒，初步统计，每年所节省下来的粮食，约可等于近百万人口全年所需的粮食。内蒙古自治区乌兰浩特制酒厂接受沈阳国营制酒厂用糠和麸子制曲的经验后，不但可节约粮食，并提高了出酒率百分之十四点八。现在内蒙已有十一个国营酒厂准备推广这一经验，推广后每年约可节约粮食六百六十多万斤；节约资金和降低成本五亿多元。国营天津酿酒厂在去年十月底，已试验以鲜白薯制酒成功；河北安国酒厂去年第四季度用山药干制酒，节省了九十九万多斤粮食；通县专区制酒工业十一月份试用薯干制酒，已节约粮食百万斤；四川泸州酒厂也已采用番茄酿酒。此外，许多地区酿酒厂的工人纷纷采用各地盛产的各种非粮食原料进行酿酒已获很大成绩。
    在纺织工厂中浆纱所用的面粉，有不少厂亦已采用代用品。如石家庄纺织厂采用山芋粉进行浆纱，纱布质量有了显著提高，估计每年可节约面粉二十五万斤以上。山东潍坊市公私合营兴华织布厂浆纱工人辛子良创造用白矾浆纱法，也可提高布的质量，现已在该市五十多家织布厂和不少的家庭织布户中推广。
