Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 6th: Li Sang-cho replied to Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on January 4th, regarding the Indian Custodial Forces' work of checking prisoner-of-war lists. Li Sang-cho requested that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces simultaneously identify and isolate American special agents mixed among the prisoners of war during the checking of the lists, and to dismantle the special agent organizations. The full text of Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho's letter is as follows: Lieutenant General Thimayya:

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 2, 1954, in which you stated that the work carried out by the Indian Custodial Forces at Enclosure B in Tongjang-ni on December 31, 1953, was a work of checking the lists and was by no means any form of "screening." You also stated that the Indian Custodial Forces would never arbitrarily replace the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" with the so-called "screening" procedures, which is welcome.

However, I must point out that after the Indian Custodial Forces carried out the work of checking the lists on December 31, 1953, the United Nations Command and even the Indian press stated that this was a "screening" of the prisoners of war in Enclosure B by the Indian Custodial Forces. According to news reports from the United Nations Command on that day, and even the spokesman of the Indian Custodial Forces, the actions of the Indian Custodial Forces on that day were described as "screening." I hope you will clarify this.

The fact that the Indian Custodial Forces only carried out the work of checking the prisoner-of-war lists after being responsible for the custodial work for several months proves that the Indian Custodial Forces are still unclear about the basic situation of the prisoner-of-war camp in Tongjang-ni. In order to quickly correct this serious situation, I request the Indian Custodial Forces to immediately increase their forces and genuinely take on the responsibility of guarding the prisoner-of-war camp in Tongjang-ni.

At the same time, the work of checking the prisoner-of-war lists by the Indian Custodial Forces fully proves that the identification and isolation of special agents is completely possible. You stated in your letter that "prisoner-of-war organizations still exist, and their coercive nature and harmful influence also still exist."

In order to implement the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and correct the intolerable situation that has existed for a long time in the Tongjang-ni prisoner-of-war camp under the nominal supervision of the Indian Custodial Forces, I request the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces to simultaneously identify and isolate special agents and dismantle special agent organizations during the checking of the prisoner-of-war lists.

I await your reply.

Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army,
Lieutenant General of the Korean People's Army, Li Sang-cho
January 4, 1954

    李相朝中将复函中立国遣返委员会主席
    要求在查对战俘名单时识辨和隔离特务
   【新华社开城六日电】李相朝中将于一月四日就印度看管部队查对战俘名单事复函中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将，要求中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队在查对战俘名单中同时辨认与隔离混在战俘中间的美方特务，打散特务组织。李相朝中将的信全文如下：蒂迈雅中将：
    我荣幸地收到了一九五四年一月二日你的来信，信中你表示一九五三年十二月三十一日印度看管部队在东场里乙号围场所进行的是查对名单的工作而绝不是任何形式的“甄别”，你并表示印度看管部队绝不会以据称的“甄别”手续来武断地代替“职权范围”的规定，这是值得欢迎的。
    但我必须指出：印度看管部队于一九五三年十二月三十一日进行查对名单的工作后，联合国军方面以至于印度的新闻界都说这是印度看管部队对乙号围场的战俘所进行的“甄别”。根据当天联合国军方面的新闻报道，甚至印度看管部队的发言人，也曾把当天印度看管部队的行动说成是“甄别”，对此我希望你予以澄清。
    印度看管部队在负责看管工作数月之后，方才进行查对战俘名单的工作，证明了印度看管部队对于东场里战俘营的基本状况至今仍不清楚。为迅速纠正这一严重的情况，我要求印度看管部队立即增调部队，名符其实地担负起看管东场里战俘营的责任。
    同时，印度看管部队查对战俘名单的工作，也充分证明了识辨与隔离特务是完全可能做到的。你在来信中说明“战俘组织依然存在，其胁迫的性质与有害的影响也依然存在”。
    为实施“职权范围”的规定，纠正东场里战俘营在印度看管部队名义上的看管下长时期来所存在的令人无可容忍的情况，我要求中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队在查对战俘名单中同时辨认与隔离特务，打散特务组织。
    我等待你的回答。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表
    朝鲜人民军中将                 李相朝
    一九五四年一月四日
