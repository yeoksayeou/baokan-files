The general line guides our handicraft industry to victorious advance
Huang Jiasheng, Director of the Beijing No. 1 Food Production Cooperative

    On the basis of the great victories achieved in 1953, we have entered 1954. In 1953, Chairman Mao clearly put forward the general line for the transition period in our country, which is a great encouragement to the people of our country. The members of our Beijing No. 1 Food Production Cooperative deeply understand the greatness and correctness of the general line. The development process of our production cooperative over the past three years fully demonstrates that carrying out socialist transformation of handicrafts through cooperation is the only bright path for handicrafts.

    In June 1950, three of us unemployed workers first organized a production team. After being organized, it developed rapidly under the leadership and support of the state. In April 1951, a production cooperative was established, and now it has developed into a large cooperative with 120 people. Our capital was initially only 1.2 million yuan, but now it is nearly 900 million yuan. Originally, it was entirely handicraft production, but now it has transitioned to semi-mechanized production. Therefore, labor productivity has greatly increased: when we first organized, the average person produced 40 jin of fruit candy per day, but now each person produces 176 jin per day, an increase of more than three times. The cost of products is also constantly decreasing. Comparing November and January of 1953, the cost of fruit candy decreased by 3.7 percent, and the cost of bread decreased by 4.2 percent. The average salary of members increased by 113 percent in December 1952 compared to January of the same year, and increased by another 40 percent in November 1953 compared to December 1952. In addition to salary, there is also a labor dividend at the end of the year. In 1952, each member received an average of 1 million yuan in labor dividends, and in 1953, it is estimated that each member will receive an average of about 1.4 million yuan. Many of our members couldn't even afford a pair of shoes before joining the cooperative, but now they not only wear leather shoes and wristwatches, but some have also bought new bicycles.

    When our food production team was first organized, we only raised 1.2 million yuan in shares. That little money was almost spent on buying some sugar and spices. We found a copper basin as a sugar-boiling pot, and moved the stone steps in front of the gate in to use as a sugar-cooling board... That's how we started production by piecing things together. None of the three of us took a salary, but each of us took 3,000 yuan a day for food expenses. In those difficult times, the Beijing Cooperative Federation and others gave us great help. The Beijing Cooperative Federation allowed us to open a store in the Xidan business department of the cooperative. From August 1950, they entrusted us with processing bagged sugar. The consumer cooperatives of the Ministry of Education, the General Post Office, and the People's Printing Factory successively established business relationships with us. Once, when our capital turnover was slow, the Consumer Cooperative of the General Post Office lent us two large bags of sugar. Other consumer cooperatives often used the method of paying for goods in advance to support our production. Many government agencies and troops knew that we were organized handicraftsmen and were willing to entrust us with processing and ordering goods. A certain troop once entrusted us with processing 40 bags of flour for military biscuits, which solved our production problem for 30 days. By the end of 1950, we had accumulated 5.5 million yuan in capital, and the number of team members had grown to twelve. By April 1951, we had the conditions to organize a cooperative, and we officially established the Food Production Cooperative.

    At the end of 1950, Wang Yuting, the owner of the private Guangming Confectionery Factory (where I had worked as an apprentice and technician), took the opportunity of our need for tools to sneak into our production team and usurp leadership. After he came in, he showed off his old tricks of speculation and profiteering, and cutting corners. He didn't work, but his salary was higher than anyone else's, and he also provoked disharmony among the team members, causing a chaotic atmosphere in the team. When the cooperative was established, we no longer elected him as a leader, and he further sabotaged the cooperative. He not only did not work hard himself, but also said to the members with low awareness: "Running a cooperative is freezing, starving, and fooling around. It's not a proper business at all." He wooed them to start another factory, wanting to undermine the cooperative. Later, we couldn't bear it any longer, so we convened a general meeting of all members, and unanimously passed a resolution to expel him. When Wang Yuting left, he took away the complete set of tools, and also pulled away two salespersons, two female packaging workers, and one worker. He went out and organized another Zhengxing Confectionery Factory, and boasted that he would "squeeze out" our cooperative within six months.

    After Wang Yuting left, we convened a general meeting of all members to run the cooperative well. Wang Yuting relied on beautiful candy packaging and willingness to give credit to compete with us, so we used low prices and high quality to consolidate and expand sales channels. In less than half a year, Wang Yuting's private confectionery factory closed down due to poor product quality, high prices, and difficulty in sales, and finally sold the complete set of tools to our cooperative. The five people who had been pulled away also re-joined the cooperative after self-criticism.

    We expelled the capitalist Wang Yuting, but the remnants of capitalist ideology among the members were not completely eliminated. With the expansion of business and the increase in the cooperative's surplus, many members demanded higher wages, and there was a thought of wanting to live a good life personally, "not accumulating" and "dividing everything up". At that time, the Beijing Cooperative Federation did not approve our wage increase, so some members were dissatisfied with the Beijing Cooperative Federation, and even under-reported sales, reduced book profits, and divided the earned money among themselves. Soon, the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements were launched, exposing our bourgeois ideology and the act of deceiving superiors, and everyone received a great education. We realized that only by accumulating public funds, adding production equipment, and expanding production can we truly improve the lives of members. Based on our production situation, we revised the cooperative's charter, increasing the proportion of public accumulation funds from 40 percent to 47 percent; when revising the charter in September 1953, we further increased the proportion of public accumulation funds to 50 percent. This ensured the consolidation and development of the cooperative.

    Through the struggle with the capitalist and the struggle with the capitalist ideology of the members, the collectivist ideology of the members was established, and various democratic management systems and reasonable distribution methods were gradually established.

    The highest democratic authority of our cooperative is the general meeting of all members. The general meeting elects the board of directors and the board of supervisors. The board of directors holds regular meetings twice a month to study production work; the board of supervisors also holds regular meetings twice a month, mainly to inspect the work of the board of directors and the production situation. The board of directors and the board of supervisors report their work at the monthly general meeting of members. At the same time, we have also improved the grassroots organizations and regularly listened to the opinions of the members through reporting and other systems. The democratic management system has fully mobilized the labor enthusiasm of the members. In this production increase and economy drive, we have found thirteen tips to improve labor productivity and reduce costs.

    The principle of surplus distribution in our cooperative is: to ensure that the collectively owned property of all members continues to increase, and that the lives of the members gradually improve with the development of business. The specific proportions are: 50 percent for public accumulation funds, 25 percent for labor dividends, 5 percent for education funds, 10 percent for construction funds, 5 percent for labor bonus funds, and 5 percent for welfare funds. Now our capital is nearly 900 million yuan, and we do not need national loans. We now have eleven food machines, such as egg beaters, sugar rolling machines, and noodle rolling machines, and eighty factory buildings. Our products are not only sold in this city, but also supplied to supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives in Tongxian, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Datong, Xuanhua, and other places.

    Our cooperative also attaches great importance to mutual assistance in technology. Thirty-two of the forty-three technicians have been trained and promoted from our cooperative's trainees. At the same time, we have also organized cultural learning and political learning. Currently, thirty-four of our members are participating in cultural learning, and others are participating in political learning. Like me, I used to only know three to five hundred characters, but now I know more than two thousand characters and can write simple reports. Because the political awareness of the members is constantly improving, in January 1953, we established the Communist Youth League organization in our cooperative, and nine young members gloriously joined the Communist Youth League. I and two other members also participated in the training class organized by the district committee to listen to Party lectures.

    The members of our production cooperative, some of whom were originally handicraft workers, and some of whom were originally independent handicraft laborers, have seen the changes in the cooperative and themselves over the past few years, and they all said: "We have embarked on a bright road."

    Currently, we are studying the general line for the transition period of the country. Everyone has a clearer understanding of the direction of progress, and the enthusiasm for production is even greater. In 1954, we plan to develop the number of members to 300, and plan to add two retail outlets so that our products can directly meet consumers. In order to meet the needs of the people, we plan to add new commodities in 1954, and also plan to expand the factory buildings and purchase delivery trucks. In terms of member benefits, we plan to establish a club in 1954, open a formal spare-time school, and run a small nursery. Under the illumination of the general line, our production cooperative will continue to advance, advance.

    总路线引导我们手工业胜利前进
    北京市第一食品生产合作社主任　黄嘉生
    在一九五三年各项伟大胜利的基础上，我们进入了一九五四年。在一九五三年里，毛主席明确地提出了我国过渡时期的总路线，这对我们全国人民是一个很大的鼓舞。我们北京市第一食品生产合作社的社员们，深深体会到总路线的伟大和正确。从我们生产合作社三年多的发展过程里面，可以充分地看出通过合作化对手工业实行社会主义改造，是手工业的一条唯一的光明大道。
    一九五零年六月间，我们三个失业工人先组织了个生产小组。组织起来以后，在国家扶植领导下发展很快，一九五一年四月成立了生产合作社，到现在已经发展成一个一百二十个人的大社了。我们的资金，最初只有一百二十万元，现在已经近九亿元。原来完全是手工业生产，现在已经过渡到半机械化生产。因此，劳动生产率大大提高：在刚组织起来的时候，平均每人每天生产水果糖四十斤，现在每人每天生产一百七十六斤，生产率提高了三倍多。产品成本也不断降低，一九五三年十一月份和一月份比较，水果糖的成本降低了百分之三点七，面包成本降低了百分之四点二。社员平均工资，一九五二年十二月份比同年一月份增加百分之一百一十三，一九五三年十一月份又比一九五二年十二月份增加百分之四十。除了工资，年终还有劳动返还金。一九五二年，每个社员平均分到劳动返还金一百万元，一九五三年平均大约可分到一百四十万元。我们有许多社员没有参加合作社的时候，连双鞋都买不起，现在不但穿上皮鞋，戴上手表，有的还买了新自行车。
    我们的食品生产小组刚组织起来的时候，只凑了一百二十万元的股金。那点钱，买了一些砂糖、香料就差不多花光了。我们找了个铜盆当熬糖锅，把大门前石台阶搬进来当凉糖板，……就这样东拼西凑地开始了生产。我们三个人谁也不拿工资，每人一天就拿三千块钱的伙食费。在那艰苦的时候，北京市合作总社等给了我们很大帮助。北京市合作总社让我们在合作社西单营业部开了个门市部，从一九五零年八月开始，委托我们加工袋糖；教育部、邮政总局、人民印刷厂等消费合作社先后和我们建立了业务关系。有一次，我们资金周转不动了，邮政总局消费合作社就借给我们两大包砂糖。别的消费合作社也常用先付货款的办法来扶助我们生产。许多机关、部队知道我们是组织起来的手工业者，都乐意向我们委托加工、订货。某部队一次委托我们加工四十袋面粉的军用饼干，解决了我们三十天的生产问题。到一九五零年年底，我们便积累了五百五十万元资金，组员发展到十二个人。到
  一九五一年四月间，我们具备了组织合作社的条件，就正式成立了食品生产合作社。
    在一九五零年年底，私营光明糖果厂（我曾经在那里当过学徒、技工）的老板王玉庭趁我们需要工具的机会，钻进了我们生产小组，并且篡夺了领导权。他进来以后，投机倒把、偷工减料的一套老本领都施展出来了。他不干活，工资却比谁都高，还挑拨组员们不和睦，闹得组里乌烟瘴气。成立合作社的时候，我们不再选他当领导人，他就进一步对合作社进行破坏。他不但自己不好好工作，还对觉悟不高的社员说：“搞合作社是挨冻受饿瞎胡闹，根本不算正经生意。”拉拢他们另外搞厂子，想拆合作社的台。后来，我们实在忍无可忍，就召开了全体社员大会，会上一致通过决议把他开除了。王玉庭走时，带走了全套工具，还拉走了两个售货员、两个包装女工和一个工人。他出去另外组织了个正兴糖果厂，并且夸口说要在六个月内“挤垮”我们合作社。
    王玉庭走后，我们召开了全体社员大会，办好合作社。王玉庭靠糖果包装漂亮、肯赊欠来和我们竞争，我们就用价钱低、质量好的办法来巩固和扩大销路。不到半年工夫，王玉庭的私营糖果厂因为产品质劣、价高，销路困难，歇了业，最后还把全套工具卖给了我们合作社。被拉走的五个人经过检讨也重新回到合作社来。
    我们开除了资本家王玉庭，但是社员中间的资本主义思想残余却没有消除净。随着业务的扩大，社里盈余的增加，不少社员要求提高工资，存在着个人想过好生活，“不要积累”和“分光”的思想。当时北京市合作总社没有批准我们增加工资，有些社员就对北京市合作总社不满意，甚至卖了货少记账，减少账面利润，把赚的钱大伙分了。不久，展开了伟大的“三反”“五反”运动，揭发了我们的资产阶级思想和欺骗上级的行为，大伙受到了极大的教育。我们认识到只有积累公共资金，增添生产设备，扩大生产，才能真正地改善社员生活。根据我们的生产情况，我们重新修改了社章，把公积金的比例数由百分之四十提高到百分之四十七；在一九五三年九月修改社章时，又把公积金的比例数提高到百分之五十。这样就保证了合作社的巩固和发展。
    经过和资本家进行斗争，和社员的资本主义思想进行斗争，社员们的集体主义思想树立起来了，并且逐步建立了各种民主管理制度和合理的分配办法。
    我们合作社的最高的民主权力机关是全体社员大会。社员大会选举理事会和监事会。理事会每月定期召开两次会议，研究生产工作；监事会每月也定期召开两次会议，主要是检查理事会的工作和生产情况。理事会和监事会要在每月定期召开的社员大会上报告工作。同时，我们还健全了基层组织，通过汇报等制度经常听取社员的意见。民主管理制度充分发挥了社员的劳动积极性，这次增产节约运动中，我们就找到了十三个窍门，提高了劳动生产率，降低了成本。
    我们合作社盈余分配的原则是：保证全体社员集体所有财产不断增加，和社员生活随着业务发展逐步改善。具体比例是：公积金百分之五十，劳动返还金百分之二十五，教育基金百分之五，建设基金百分之十，劳动奖励金百分之五，福利金百分之五。现在我们的资金已经近九亿元，不需要国家贷款了。现在我们已经有打蛋机、轧糖机、轧面机等各种食品机十一台，厂房八十间。我们的产品除在本市销售，还供应通县、张家口、石家庄、大同、宣化等地的供销、消费合作社。
    我们社里还很重视在技术方面互相帮助，现在四十三个技工当中有三十二个是从我们合作社的练习生中培养提拔起来的。同时，我们还组织了文化学习和政治学习。目前，我们有三十四个社员参加文化学习，其他的人参加政治学习。像我以前只认识三、五百字，现在已经认识两千多字，能写简单的报告了。由于社员政治觉悟不断提高，一九五三年一月份，我们社里建立了青年团的组织，有九个青年社员光荣地参加了青年团。我和其他两个社员还参加区委组织的训练班听党课。
    我们生产合作社的社员，有的原来是手工业工人，有的原来是独立劳动的手工业者，大伙看着合作社和自己几年来的变化，都说：“我们走上了一条光明的大道。”
    目前，我们正在学习国家过渡时期的总路线，大伙对前进的方向认识得更明确了，生产劲头更大了。一九五四年，我们准备发展社员到三百人，准备增设两个零售门市部，以便使我们的产品直接和消费者见面。为了满足人民的需要，我们准备在一九五四年增加新商品，还计划扩大厂房，购买送货汽车。在社员福利方面，我们准备在一九五四年成立俱乐部，开办个正式的业余学校，举办个小型托儿所。在总路线的照耀下，我们生产合作社将不断地前进，前进。
