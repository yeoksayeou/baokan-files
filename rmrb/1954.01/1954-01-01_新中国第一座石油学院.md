    The First Petroleum Institute of New China
    Xu Linjun
    In the northeast corner of the western suburbs of Beijing, six red-roofed buildings with upturned eaves stand tall. Upon entering the gate, one sees two classroom buildings, with a wide and flat road in between. Next to the south classroom building, the metalworking practice factory is being roofed; next to the north classroom building, the construction of the gas factory is expanding into the air. In the early morning, road rollers rumble on the road, and students with books and lecture notes, with excitement, facing the morning sun, rush along the newly paved road towards a row of neat temporary classrooms. This is the Beijing Petroleum Institute.
    When people see these brand-new buildings, they associate them with the bright future of the motherland's petroleum industry. From here, thousands of technical cadres will be continuously sent to refineries and mines across the country.
    The Beijing Petroleum Institute is the first higher industrial school in China to train technical cadres for the petroleum industry. It has only a short history since its establishment. In 1950, the Department of Chemical Engineering of Tsinghua University established a petroleum group with only twenty students; in 1952, it expanded into the Department of Petroleum, with the number of students increasing to more than 600; in the autumn of 1953, the Department of Petroleum separated from Tsinghua University and became an independent specialized institute. Now, the school has three departments: Petroleum Drilling, Petroleum Refining, and Petroleum Machinery, and has set up seven specialties including Drilling, Oil Production, Storage and Transportation, Refining, and Mine Machinery, Refinery Machinery, and Synthetic Petroleum. The school has more than 200 teachers and more than 1,100 students. In the future, the school will add departments such as Petroleum Geology, Petroleum Economics, and Physical Exploration; the equipment will also be greatly enriched, so that the practice factory will have modern mechanical equipment, and the laboratory will have perfect experimental instruments, and the school will achieve greater development.
    The teachers all participated in intensive Russian language learning, which improved their Russian proficiency. Many teachers are now able to preliminarily read Russian professional books. The Petroleum Engineering Teaching and Research Group has preliminarily translated the thick three-volume Soviet textbook "Petroleum Technology," and is now proofreading it.
    From their professional studies, the teachers have all realized the superiority of Soviet teaching materials. Yang Guanghua, a teacher in the Petroleum Engineering Teaching and Research Group, said: "When Soviet teaching materials talk about ketone-benzene dewaxing, they say that 7% of toluene should be added to lower the freezing point of the solvent, while British and American textbooks do not have this. This alone shows that Soviet science and industrial practice are closely integrated." Teachers Yu Zhiying and Gu Lecheng of the Chemistry Teaching and Research Group often carefully read every chapter and section of Soviet chemistry textbooks, do not miss any questions, and often discuss them with senior teachers. In teaching, they deeply realize that Soviet teaching materials have clear purpose and rigorous scientificity. They believe: "The Soviet general chemistry textbook starts from the law of conservation of mass to the law of multiple proportions, to equivalents, and further to atomic structure, and in later chapters uses the principles of atomic structure to explain various chemical phenomena and chemical principles. In this way, one ring fits into another, systematically from chemical phenomena to atomic structure, and then from the core structure to various chemical phenomena." Because the teachers can study the Soviet Union seriously, the quality of teaching is improving day by day. At present, most of the school's professional courses and many basic courses use textbooks from Soviet petroleum institutes; some courses are based on Soviet textbooks to prepare lectures.
    The Petroleum Institute has 19 teaching and research groups, most of which are newly established. 80% of the teachers are new teachers and lack teaching experience, so they encounter many difficulties in teaching. However, the teachers all realize the importance of the petroleum industry and can work hard to overcome difficulties and improve teaching. All teaching and research groups attach great importance to the training of teachers. Some teaching and research groups send young teachers who lack practical experience to factories and mines in the Northeast or Northwest regions for internships, and some send them to other schools for further studies. The teachers who stay at the school, under the leadership of the teaching and research group, systematically study Soviet teaching materials and regularly make study reports or discussions.
    The old teachers realize that to train a large number of technical cadres in the petroleum industry, it is impossible to rely on a few old teachers alone, and it is necessary to train a large number of new teachers. Now, many teaching and research groups have formulated lecture plans for new teachers in 1954.
    Young teachers, with the help of old teachers, have exerted creativity in teaching. For example, in the mechanical drawing teaching group, the vast majority are young teachers, who undertake the teaching tasks of mechanical drawing and descriptive geometry for more than 700 students in the school. In order to reduce the learning difficulties for students, they rushed to produce more than 30 large wall charts in two weeks. The engineering drawing group put forward the requirement of "giving full play to collective strength, studying teaching business and teaching methods" in the work plan for this semester. Many young teachers independently undertake the task of lecturing. Because they can learn modestly and work with enthusiasm, they are generally welcomed by the students. Now many young teachers have made further study plans.
    Under the condition that the laboratory has not yet been established, the graduate students proposed: "As long as there is power and water, we can build a laboratory with our own hands!" They used wooden boxes to transform into experimental tables, and used buckets and glass tubes to set up a water supply system. Now, they are already studying "catalytic cracking" in their own established laboratory.
    The students also meet new learning tasks with the spirit of overcoming difficulties and studying hard. When the third-year students heard that the Soviet Union would help China build a modern large refinery in China's first five-year plan, a moving picture appeared in their minds: distillation towers and cracking towers as high as dozens of meters, huge oil storage tanks, new hot oil pumps, automatic control instruments... How fascinating that all is! At a study symposium held by the Youth League, student Yan Dafan said: "When I went to the Northeast for an internship this year, when I passed through the Liaoxi Plain, I thought to myself: if farmers could drive diesel-powered tractors to cultivate on this plain, how many times would the grain yield increase! This requires us to be able to supply the best diesel to collective farms in the future." Student Chen Jiancun used to want to transfer to another department, but now he dismissed this idea. He said: "Once, I met air force hero Zhao Baotong in the Summer Palace. As soon as he knew that I was studying petroleum industry, he excitedly held my hand tightly and said: The air force has a close relationship with petroleum. Without petroleum, airplanes would become waste. Yes, without petroleum, there would be no solid national defense, and the construction of the country cannot be guaranteed. I must dedicate my life to the petroleum industry." The fourth-year students of the Petroleum Refining Department who are about to graduate are eagerly waiting to participate in the construction of the motherland's first five-year plan. They have all formulated personal study plans on how to spend the last year of university.
    Under the light of the general line of the state's transition period, China's young petroleum industry will achieve rapid development, countless magnificent derricks will stand on the vast land of the Northwest, and thousands of cadres and workers will operate in large-scale refineries. At that time, the students will proudly answer: "Motherland! We are ready, leave the task of building the petroleum industry to us! We can undertake it!" (Attached picture)

    新中国第一座石油学院
    许林君
    在北京西郊东北角上，耸立着六座红色屋顶、带有飞檐的高楼。一进大门，便见到两座教室大楼，中间铺着一条宽广平坦的大道。南教室楼旁边，金工实习厂正在盖着屋顶；北教室楼旁边，煤气工厂的建筑，正在向空中扩展。清晨，辗土机在路上轧轧地响着，同学们夹着书本和讲义，怀着兴奋的心情，迎着朝阳，踏着新铺的马路匆匆地走向一排排整齐的临时教室。这便是北京石油学院。
    人们一见到这些崭新的高楼，便联想到祖国石油事业的光明远景。从这里，将源源不断地输送成千的技术干部到各地炼油厂、矿井中去。
    北京石油学院，是我国第一所培养石油工业技术干部的高等工业学校。它成立到现在，只有很短的一段历史。一九五○年，清华大学化工系成立了一个石油组，只有同学二十人；一九五二年，它扩大为石油系，学生人数增加到六百多人；一九五三年秋季，石油系由清华大学分出来，成为一个独立的专门学院。现在，学校分设石油钻探、石油炼制和石油机械三个系，并设置有钻井、采油、储运、炼制及矿场机械、炼厂机械、人造石油等七个专业。全校有二百多个教师和一千一百多名学生，将来学校还要添设石油地质、石油经济等系及物理探勘专业；设备也将大大充实起来，使实习工厂里有近代化的机械设备，实验室里有完善的实验仪器，学校将获得更大的发展。
    教师们都参加了俄文速成学习，提高了俄文的水平。不少教师已能初步阅读俄文专业书籍了。石油工学教研组已将厚厚的三大本苏联“石油工艺学”教科书初步翻译出来了，现在正在进行校对。
    从业务学习中，教师们都体会到苏联教材的优越性。石油工学教研组杨光华教师说：“苏联教材中讲到酮苯脱腊时，说要加入百分之七的甲苯，以降低溶剂的凝固点，而英美的教科书上是没有的。仅仅这一点就说明了苏联科学和工业实际是密切结合着的。”化学教研组教师余志英、顾乐诚，经常仔细地阅读苏联化学教科书的每一章每一节，不放过每一个问题，并常和老教师商量。在教学中，他们深深地体会到苏联教材有明确的目的性和严整的科学性。他们认为：“苏联普通化学教科书由质量不灭定律讲到倍比定律，讲到当量，更进一步讲到原子构造，而在以后的章节中再用原子构造的原理去解释各种化学现象和化学原理。这样一环套一环，系统地由化学现象进入到原子构造，再由核心构造说到各种化学现象。”由于教师们能认真地学习苏联，教学质量一天天地提高着。目前，学校的大部分专业课程和许多基础课程，都采用苏联石油学院的教材；部分课程则根据苏联教材编写讲义。
    石油学院现有十九个教研组，其中大多数是新成立的。教师中百分之八十是新教师，缺乏教学经验，因此在教学上碰到很多的困难。但教师们都认识到石油工业的重要性，能努力克服困难，提高教学。各教研组对师资的培养是十分重视的。有的教研组把缺乏实际经验的青年教师派到东北或西北地区的厂矿去实习，有的派到其他学校去进修。留在学校的教师们在教研组的领导下，系统地钻研苏联教材，定期做学习报告或讨论会。
    老教师们体会到，要大量培养石油工业技术干部，光靠几个老教师是不可能的，必需大量地培养新师资。现在，不少教研组都已订出了一九五四年新教师的讲课计划。
    青年教师在老教师帮助下，在教学上发挥了创造性。例如，机械制图教学小组中，绝大多数是年青教师，他们担负着全校七百多名学生的机械制图及画法几何的教学任务。为了使同学减少学习上的困难，他们曾在两周内赶制了三十多张大挂图。工程制图小组在本学期的工作计划中提出了“发挥集体力量，钻研教学业务与教学方法”的要求。不少青年教师独立地担负起讲课的任务。由于他们能虚心学习，工作有热情，一般都受到同学的欢迎。现在许多青年教师都订了进修计划。
    在实验室还未建立的条件下，研究生们提出：“只要有电源和水源，我们就能以自己的双手建立实验室！”他们用木箱改装成实验桌，用水桶和玻璃管设置了供水系统。现在，他们已经在自己建立的实验室中研究“接触裂化”了。
    同学们也以克服困难、努力学习的精神，迎接新的学习任务。当三年级同学听到在我国第一个五年计划中，苏联将帮助我国建立现代化的大炼油厂的消息时，在他们的眼前出现了一幅动人的图画：高达数十公尺的蒸馏塔、裂化塔，巨大的储油罐，新式的热油泵，自动控制仪表……。那一切多么令人向往呀！在青年团召开的一次学习座谈会上，严大凡同学说：“今年到东北实习，经过辽西大平原时，我心里就想着：在这大平原上，如果让农民驾着柴油发动的拖拉机来耕种，粮食的产量不知要提高多少倍呢！这就要求我们能在将来把最好的柴油供给集体农庄。”陈建存同学过去曾想转系，现在打消了这种念头，他说：“有一次，我在颐和园碰到了空军英雄赵宝桐。他一知道我是学石油工业的，就兴奋地紧握着我的手说：空军和石油有着密切的联系，如果没有石油，飞机就成为废物。是的，没有石油就不可能有巩固的国防，就不能保证国家的建设，我一定要把我的一生贡献给石油事业。”快要毕业的石油炼制系四年级同学热切地等待着参加祖国第一个五年计划建设。他们都订立了如何渡过大学最后一年的个人学习计划。
    在国家过渡时期总路线照耀之下，我国年青的石油工业将得到飞跃的发展，无数雄伟的井架将耸立在西北辽阔的土地上，成千上万的干部和工人将操作在规模宏大的炼油厂中。那时，同学们将骄傲地回答说：“祖国！我们已经准备好了，把建设石油工业的任务交给我们吧！我们承当得起来！”（附图片）
