Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 15th: The Northeast region will conduct investigations and rectifications, with leadership, of the agricultural production cooperatives spontaneously organized by farmers.

    With the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives and the expansion of their influence, approximately 420 agricultural production cooperatives spontaneously formed by farmers emerged in the rural areas of Northeast China last year. Many of these agricultural production cooperatives have demonstrated the advantages of unified management in production and have produced more grain. In Liaodong Province, more than half of the 146 agricultural production cooperatives spontaneously established by farmers last year were run fairly well. In Haicheng County, of the seven spontaneously formed cooperatives, four achieved increased production and increased income for their members. For example, in the Zhang Guangquan Agricultural Production Cooperative, spontaneously formed by farmers, the income of each member's work day was equivalent to more than 60 jin of grain, and each person's total income was higher than before joining the cooperative and higher than the income of the best permanent mutual aid teams in the village.

    According to investigations in some areas, some of the better-run spontaneously formed agricultural production cooperatives have the following main reasons for success: (1) They were organized by farmers out of the need to develop production, and the participation of farmers was completely voluntary; (2) The leading cadres of the cooperative were genuinely supported by the members, and the entire cooperative was able to unite as one; (3) In terms of management, they were mostly able to "run the cooperative diligently and thriftily" and "rely on their own efforts," using all available financial and material resources entirely for production, without putting on airs, and therefore had very few debts and increased income for the members; (4) The methods of cooperative management and labor organization were simple, easy to implement, and there was little waste. However, these better-run spontaneously formed agricultural production cooperatives still have many problems in the proportion of labor and land, carts, and horses in the distribution. In addition, many spontaneously formed cooperatives were not well-run.

    In order to enable these spontaneously formed agricultural production cooperatives to play a demonstrative role in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, along with the agricultural production cooperatives established with leadership, various localities are preparing to consolidate existing cooperatives and develop new cooperatives while rectifying these spontaneously formed cooperatives. The requirements for rectification are:

  (1) Those spontaneously formed cooperatives that are run relatively well should be approved as formal agricultural production cooperatives. At the same time, the experience they have gained in consolidation and the simple and easy-to-implement management, organization of labor, and other aspects should be summarized and promoted locally in order to promote the development of agricultural production cooperatives in the area; for their shortcomings and unreasonable parts, help them make reasonable changes under the principles of running the cooperative, through democratic discussion and on a voluntary basis, in order to achieve consolidation and improvement. (2) Those spontaneously formed cooperatives that are not run well or are run badly should be patiently rectified to consolidate and improve them; for those cooperatives that really cannot continue to operate, members should be mobilized to help them change to mutual aid teams, so as to create conditions for future development into agricultural production cooperatives.

### 东北整顿自发组成的农业合作社

    东北整顿自发组成的农业合作社
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北区各地对农民自发组织起来的农业生产合作社，将有领导地进行调查和整顿工作。
    随着农业生产合作社的建立和其影响的扩大，东北农村在去年约出现了四百二十多个农民自发组成的农业生产合作社。这些农业生产合作社，有不少在生产上也显示出了统一经营的优越性，多打了粮食。辽东省去年由农民自发建立起来的一百四十六个农业生产合作社中，有一半以上办的不坏。该省海城县七个自发社，有四个作到了增产和增加了社员的收入。如农民自发组成的张广全农业生产合作社，社员每个劳动日的收入折合六十多斤粮食，每人的总收入，比入社前和村中最好的常年互助组农民的收入都多。
    据某些地区的调查：有些自发农业生产合作社办得较好，主要有以下原因：（一）是农民在发展生产的需要下组织起来的，入社农民完全自愿；
  （二）社的领导干部，是社员真正拥护的人，全社能够团结一致；（三）在经营上，大多能“勤俭办社”，“自力更生”，把仅有的财力物力完全用于生产，不摆摊子，因而债务很少，社员收入增多；（四）在社务管理和劳动组织上，方法简便，容易实行，浪费现象少。但是，这些办得较好的自发农业生产合作社，在劳动和土地、车马的分配比例上，还存在着不少问题。另外也有不少自发社没有办好。
    为使这些自发农业生产合作社能和有领导地办起来的农业生产合作社，在互助合作运动中同样起到示范作用，各地已准备在巩固现有社和发展新社的同时，对这些自发社加以整顿。整顿的要求是：
  （一）对那些办的较好的自发社，批准它们成为正式的农业生产合作社。同时，要总结它们获得巩固和简便易行的经营管理、组织劳动等方面的经验，就地推广，以便推动当地农业生产合作社的发展；对它的缺点和不合理部分，根据办社的方针，在社员民主讨论和自愿的原则下，帮助它们加以合理改变，以求得巩固和提高。（二）对那些办的不好或办坏了的自发社，要耐心地对它们加以很好的整顿，使之巩固和提高；实在不能办下去的社，要动员社员，帮助他们改为互助组，为将来发展成为农业生产合作社创造条件。
