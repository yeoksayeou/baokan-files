(Xinhua News Agency, 6th) The workers of national state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines across the country have been initially educated on the general line of the state during the transition period.

The vigorous work of publicizing the general line to workers in the Northeast, North China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest regions began in November of last year. Most factories and mines made reports on the transmission of the general line and organized forums for workers, staff, and their families. Some factories and mines also used exhibitions, movies, slides, cartoons, radio stations, and other forms to publicize the general line in a vivid and accessible way, tailored to the ideological situation of the workers. Many factories in Lüda systematically screened films such as "Virgin Soil Upturned," "Cavalier of the Gold Star," and "Donbas Miners," and exhibited pictures of "Today's China" and "The Fifth Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union," allowing workers to intimately see the new face of the motherland and the beautiful prospects of socialism after liberation. The exhibition of the Third Workshop of the Qiqihar First Machine Tool Plant not only used cartoons and charts to explain the basic content of the general line and the great responsibility of the working class in a simple way, but also introduced to the workers the seven key problems existing in the workshop and the exemplary deeds of advanced figures in the workshop, mobilizing everyone to learn from advanced figures and find tricks to solve key problems. The Communist Party Committees and trade union leaders in Gansu, Shanghai, Anshan, Chongqing, Qingdao and other places personally and purposefully publicized the general line to workers. The Communist Party Committee of the Qingdao Textile Bureau selected the cone winding workshop and the repair workshop of the No. 7 State-owned Cotton Mill to conduct typical experiments and create experience in publicizing the general line. The Central South Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other local trade union organizations and Party committees trained a large number of political instructors, counselors, or key members, and went deep into the masses of workers to conduct publicity. The Zhangjiakou Federation of Trade Unions trained more than 260 cadres above the level of family group leaders of workers to strengthen the work of publicizing the general line to workers' families. Under the specific leadership of the Party branch, the Nanjing Chemical Plant conducted repeated publicity to workers and their families and conducted a test to ensure that the general line was publicized to every household without missing a person.

After the workers were initially educated on the general line, they began to realize the long-term socialist future of the country and the glorious responsibility of the working class during the transition period, and clarified their goals. Many workers said with joy: "My eyes are bright!" "I have something to strive for!" "We will use our own hands to build the socialist building!" Sun Yumin, an old worker at the Harbin Tool Factory, knew that socialism was good in the past, but he always felt that it was boundless and worried that he could not catch up. After learning the general line, he felt grounded, and as long as he put in effort, the socialist society would get closer and closer. Liu Zhijiang, a worker at the Chengzi Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, said: "When we first liberated, we used hand hammers to mine coal. Now we are using electric drills and coal cutting machines. In a socialist society, our coal mines will be completely mechanized!" Encouraged by the general line, workers in Anshan, Harbin, Lüda and other places launched a heat wave of finding tricks and tapping potential around the key to production and learning from Wang Chonglun. After learning the general line, workers in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao and other places have revised their production increase and conservation plans to create more wealth for the country.

During the study, workers in many factories and mines carried out self-criticism of various incorrect ideas. Workers in the Shenyang Woolen Mill and the local state-owned light industry in Hubei Province criticized the erroneous view that "there is no future in engaging in light industry," and recognized the glorious task of light industry to accumulate funds for the country and meet the needs of the people's lives. Dong Xiulan, a female worker at the Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill, and Gao Ruifen, a female worker at the Shijiazhuang Knitting Factory, criticized the ideas of being satisfied with the status quo, waiting for socialism, and "following along," and began to use outstanding labor to strive for the early realization of socialist industrialization. Some workers criticized the idea of ​​only seeing personal interests and immediate interests, and not seeing national interests and long-term interests. Chen Yusheng, a worker at the Nanjing Chemical Plant, used to see that his factory handed over a lot of profits every year, but did not even build an auditorium. After studying, he realized that in order to realize industrialization, funds should be used "where it is needed most." Saving some now can build a big building in the future. Some workers criticized their own capitalist ideas of wanting to open a factory "small operation" and sending money home to buy land and hire workers, and drew a clear ideological line between socialism and capitalism. Wang Xiusheng, a worker in the machine shop of the Jinan First Machine Tool Plant, wanted to open a small factory in the future since he was an apprentice. When learning the general line, he criticized his capitalist ideas and dedicated tools such as high-speed steel cutter heads, drill bits, and calipers that he had prepared for opening a factory in the future to the national construction of socialism. After being educated, many family members of workers expressed that they would do a good job in housework and take good care of their children so that the workers could work with peace of mind and support the general line with practical actions. Some family members deposited the money they had prepared to buy fields and hoard grain "for future security" in the bank to support national construction.

In the process of learning the general line, the workers improved their understanding of the worker-peasant alliance. They wrote letters to their peasant brothers, promising to produce more, better, and cheaper industrial products to meet the needs of the peasants. Many workers mobilized their family members and relatives in the countryside to sell surplus grain to the state and cooperatives, and mobilized them to actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

The publicity of the general line to the workers has only been carried out in the preliminary work, and some workers' understanding of the general line is still very incomplete and not very profound. In order to make the general line deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and known to every household, and to guide the workers' political enthusiasm for loving socialism to production, various places are actively studying how to further systematically and comprehensively publicize the general line to the masses of workers and combine the publicity of the general line with improving production.

    全国国营和地方国营厂矿职工
    初步受到总路线的教育
    加劲生产争取早日实现社会主义工业化
    【新华社六日讯】全国国营和地方国营厂矿的职工，已初步受到了国家在过渡时期的总路线的教育。
    东北、华北、中南、西南、西北等地大张旗鼓向职工宣传总路线的工作，是从去年十一月开始的，大部分厂矿作了关于总路线的传达报告，并分别组织了工人、职员和家属举行座谈会。有些厂矿并通过展览会、电影、幻灯、漫画、广播台等形式，针对职工的思想情况，形象地通俗地进行宣传。旅大的许多工厂系统地放映了“被开垦的处女地”、“金星英雄”、“顿巴斯矿工”等电影，展览了“今日中国”和“苏联第五个五年计划”等图片，使职工亲切地看到解放以后祖国的新面貌和社会主义的美好远景。齐齐哈尔第一机床厂第三车间的展览会，除了用漫画、图表通俗地说明总路线的基本内容和工人阶级的伟大责任，同时还向职工介绍了本车间存在的七大关键问题和本车间先进人物的模范事迹，动员大家向先进人物学习，找窍门解决关键问题。甘肃、上海、鞍山、重庆、青岛等地的中共党委会和工会负责干部都亲自有准备有计划地向职工宣传总路线。中共青岛纺织管理局党委会曾选择国棉七厂的筒摇成车间、修理车间做典型试验，创造宣传总路线的经验。中华全国总工会中南区工作委员会和其他地方的工会组织、党委会等集训了大批的政治教员、辅导员或骨干分子，深入到职工群众中进行宣传。张家口市工会联合会训练了二百六十多个职工家属小组长以上的干部，加强对职工家属宣传总路线的工作。南京化工厂在党支部的具体领导下，向职工和职工家属进行了反复宣传，并作了一次测验，使总路线宣传做到家喻户晓，一人不漏。
    职工们初步受到总路线教育后，已开始认识到国家的社会主义远大前途和工人阶级在过渡时期的光荣责任，明确了奋斗目标。许多工人都欢欣鼓舞地说：“眼睛亮堂了！”“有了奔头了！”“我们要用自己的双手，盖起社会主义的大楼！”哈尔滨工具厂老工人孙玉敏过去光知道社会主义好，但总觉得无边无岸，怕自己赶不上。学了总路线以后，他觉得有了底了，只要拿出劲来干，社会主义社会就越来越近了。京西矿务局城子矿工人刘志江说：“刚解放那阵，我们挖煤用手锤，现在已经用上了电钻、割煤机；到了社会主义社会，咱们煤矿就要全部机械化了！”鞍山、哈尔滨、旅大等地的职工在总路线鼓舞下，掀起了围绕生产关键找窍门、挖潜力，学习王崇伦的热潮。上海、天津、青岛等地的职工学习了总路线以后，都纷纷修订了增产节约计划，为国家创造更多的财富。
    许多厂矿的工人在学习时，对各种不正确的思想展开了自我批评。沈阳毛织厂和湖北省地方国营轻工业工人批判了“搞轻工业没啥前途”的错误看法，认识到轻工业为国家积累资金和满足人民生活需要的光荣任务。天津第三棉纺织厂女工董秀兰、石家庄针织厂女工高瑞芬等批判了满足现状、坐等社会主义和“跟着走”的思想，并且开始用出色的劳动争取社会主义工业化的早日实现。有些工人批判了只看到个人利益和眼前利益，看不到国家利益和长远利益的思想。南京化工厂工人陈玉生过去看到本厂一年上缴许多利润，却连礼堂都不盖。经过学习，他认识到要实现工业化，就要把资金用在“刀口”上，现在节省些，将来就可以盖大厦了。有些工人批判了自己想开个工厂“小弄弄”，寄钱回家买地、雇工的资本主义思想，划清了社会主义和资本主义的思想界限。济南第一机床厂机工车间工人王秀生从当学徒时起就想将来开个小工厂。总路线学习时，他批判了自己的资本主义思想，把准备将来开工厂用的锋钢刀头、钻头、卡尺等工具献给国家建设社会主义。许多职工家属在受到教育以后，纷纷表示要搞好家务，带好孩子，让职工安心生产，用实际行动拥护总路线。有的家属把准备买田、囤粮“留后路”的钱，存到银行，支援国家建设。
    职工们在学习总路线过程中，提高了对工农联盟的认识。他们纷纷写信给农民弟兄，保证生产更多、更好、更便宜的工业品，满足农民的需要。许多职工动员在乡下的家属和亲友把余粮卖给国家和合作社，并动员他们积极参加互助合作运动。
    对职工的总路线宣传现在还只进行了初步工作，有些职工对总路线的了解还很不完全和很不深刻。为了使总路线深入人心，家喻户晓，并把职工热爱社会主义的政治热情，引导到生产上去，各地正在积极研究进一步有系统地全面地向职工群众宣传总路线，并把总路线宣传和改进生产结合起来。
