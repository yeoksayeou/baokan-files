    Saluting the Heroic Vietnamese People Who Strive for Independence and Freedom
    Editor's Note: January 18th is the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Vietnam and its fraternal countries. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, based on the suggestions of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association and the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, decided to hold a Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month starting from this day. The holding of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month will surely further consolidate and develop the profound brotherly friendship between the people of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China. The Chinese people express their warm congratulations on this. This newspaper publishes congratulatory letters to the Vietnamese people from Guo Zhongtian, a first-class hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Wu Yunduo, a national model worker in industry, and Geng Changsuo, a model worker in agriculture.
     Congratulatory Letter from Guo Zhongtian and Others, First-Class Heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, to the Vietnamese People's Army
    Dear Comrades of the Entire Heroic Vietnamese People's Army:
    Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Democratic Government of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, you are waging a sacred war of resistance against aggression for the just cause of freedom, independence, and world peace. For seven years, you have achieved brilliant victories, strengthened your ranks in battle, enriched your experience in struggle, and cultivated a large number of combat heroes and model workers. This has given tremendous encouragement to the people of the world who love freedom and peace. These great achievements are the glory of the Vietnamese people and the glory of all peace-loving mankind! Please accept our brotherly congratulations and high respect.
    We are soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. We volunteered to go to the Korean front to fight alongside the Korean People's Army against the frantic aggression of US imperialism for the sacred task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country. For three years, under the command of Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai, we defeated the US-led imperialist aggressor army on the Korean battlefield, annihilated more than one million enemies, destroyed and damaged more than 12,000 enemy aircraft and more than 200 various ships, and captured more than 6,000 various cannons and nearly 10,000 vehicles, tanks, and armored vehicles. We have gained rich combat experience in defeating imperialist aggression, greatly improved our combat effectiveness and confidence in defending peace, and produced more than 300,000 heroes, models, and meritorious personnel. These victories are inseparable from the support and encouragement of the Korean people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world, and inseparable from your support and encouragement. Therefore, our victory is also a common victory for you and the people of the world.
    We often hear news of your victories in Korea, and these news give us great encouragement. As early as the winter of 1950, when we had just entered Korea and were fiercely annihilating the US Eighth Army on the icy and snowy banks of the Cheongcheon River and Changjin Lake, we heard the news of your victory in the Border Campaign; in 1951, when we were blocking the enemy on both sides of the Han River and launching a mass movement to shoot down enemy aircraft, we successively heard the news of your victory in the Four Great Campaigns; in the spring of 1952, during our victorious struggle to crush the enemy's germ warfare, we heard the news of your Peace Campaign victory; in the winter of the same year, when we were inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy in the Shangganling area, we heard the good news of your great victory in the Northwest. Since last year, your victories have become more and more numerous and larger and larger, especially your recent continuous crushing of the "Navarre Military Plan" jointly formulated by the US and French aggressors, and the liberation of Lai Chau, an important town occupied by the enemy. We also know that you have launched a movement in the army to learn from combat heroes Nguyen Quoc Tri and the Jia Wen Kang group to kill the enemy and establish meritorious service, driving the enemy to flee in panic. All these victories have made the soldiers of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army cheer and be encouraged. We wish you complete victory.
    Let us report some of our situation to you. In the past three years of the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the morale of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has become higher and higher, the equipment has become better and better, and the experience has become more and more abundant. The soldiers of the Volunteer Army are brave and resourceful. We constantly overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy in battle. For example, Guo Zhongtian's platoon annihilated more than 200 enemies, captured six cannons, and 58 vehicles in a previous battle. Air Force soldier Zhang Jihui shot down the enemy's "ace pilot" Davis. In one battle, Zhang Jihui ran out of ammunition and was determined to crash into the enemy plane and die together. The cowardly enemy was frightened and hurriedly dived, but he dived too quickly, plunged into the ice, and drowned. In the counterattack at Guandaili, soldier Huang Jiafu carried out 15 demolition missions in a row, annihilated more than 200 enemies alone, and opened the way for the troops to advance, creating conditions for the follow-up troops to annihilate a large number of enemies. We also built underground tunnels on the front line with great perseverance and physical labor, making our positions more consolidated. In the Shangganling campaign, soldier Hu Xiudao used grenades, demolition tubes, and explosives to repel 41 enemy attacks, annihilating more than 280 enemies alone. Nurse Liu Xiuzhen and her platoon, with a high degree of love for the wounded and sick, cared for 1,200 wounded soldiers, and restored them all to health.
    The victorious facts of the Korean and Vietnamese battlefields prove that the era of imperialists running rampant in Asia is gone forever. The strength of peace-loving people all over the world has greatly surpassed the aggressive forces of imperialism. The Chinese people, the Korean people, and the Vietnamese people have all stood up heroically. The world's peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has also become incomparably strong. All the war policies and aggressive conspiracies of the imperialist bloc are doomed to failure.
    Dear Vietnamese brothers, you are not isolated. All peace-loving people in the world are your friends. Your struggle has the sympathy and support of all progressive mankind. Our two countries, China and Vietnam, are brotherly countries, interdependent like lips and teeth. We must continue to support your struggle. Fight bravely, Vietnamese brothers, final victory will surely belong to you!
        With brotherly greetings!
      Guo Zhongtian, First-Class Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
                          Zhang Jihui, First-Class Hero
                          Huang Jiafu, First-Class Hero
                          Hu Xiudao, First-Class Hero
                          Liu Xiuzhen, Second-Class Model
  Letter from Wu Yunduo, National Model Worker in Industry, to Vietnamese
    Worker Brothers
    Dear Vietnamese Worker Comrades:
    The Chinese people are constantly concerned with the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against aggression with the deepest affection. This is because we have long had a common destiny, experienced the same arduous struggle, and because our two peoples have had a deep friendship for a long time. This friendship has been more firmly united by the spirit of internationalism today.
    The Vietnamese people, who are brave in resisting aggression and brave in construction, have won brilliant victories under the leadership of the glorious Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh. All people who love peace, freedom, and justice in the world are sincerely delighted with the brilliant achievements won since the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In our country's newspapers and periodicals, there are often news reports and photos from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and films about the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people are also shown in our cinemas. This enables us to understand the life and struggle of the Vietnamese people more truly. We often see the Vietnamese People's Army chasing fleeing enemies through the fire net, and Vietnamese ordnance workers persisting in the production of military supplies in the mountains and forests, and printing workers printing the "Labor Newspaper" as if we were there. The names of model workers such as Wu Jiaqian and Gao Yuebao have become very familiar and very dear to us, as if we were comrades working side by side for many years, even though we do not know each other.
    I was also an ordnance worker before. When I read that Comrade Wu Jiaqian had overcome all difficulties, increased the output of the ordnance factory by 85 times, and saved a lot of working hours, raw materials, and fuel, I jumped up with joy, as if these outstanding achievements were created by us together. I know deeply that any creative labor of the people who are striving for independence and freedom is a blow to the bloodthirsty aggressors and a victory for the peace-loving people.
    Dear comrades, the Chinese people have also experienced days of arduous struggle. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, Chinese workers supported the revolutionary struggle with heroic labor. At that time, the New Fourth Army Ordnance Factory where I worked was located in a desolate mountain gully, and sometimes we had to drag our machines to fight guerrilla warfare like you. The ordnance factory initially had only a wooden bellows, a few pliers, and some scattered tools, and no modern machines at all. We manufactured batches of bayonets, bullets, grenades, rifles, landmines, and shells by hand, and handed them over to our soldiers to eliminate the enemy. Under the leadership of the Party, we gradually built many ordnance factories from scratch, from small to large, in the rear of the enemy. In order to complete urgent tasks, I was wounded three times, my left leg was crushed, my left hand fingers and right foot were blown off, my left eye was blinded, and I had more than 100 wounds all over my body. However, even in the face of the threat of death, I did not leave my battle post. Because the Party taught me how to live; because I firmly believed that our just cause would surely triumph. The Party is my strong source of combat power and the guarantee of the victory of our just cause.
    In 1949, the Chinese People's Revolution achieved victory. In the four years since then, our young People's Republic of China has grown stronger and is continuing to develop and grow stronger. We have rapidly restored the national economy and victoriously carried out the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Now, we have begun a large-scale peaceful construction, and the first five-year plan will lay a solid foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country. The Party's general line in the transition period has become the program of action for the Chinese people. It is like a beacon illuminating our way forward. It unites the people of the whole country under a common goal and struggles to build a great socialist society. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the sincere and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, we are creating a happy tomorrow with full confidence.
    At such a moment, we cannot help but be a hundred times more concerned about the struggle of our dear brothers, the Vietnamese people. We, who have just been liberated, are the easiest to understand your desire to love freedom and peaceful life.
    The sacred struggle of the Vietnamese people against the US interventionists and the French aggressors is never isolated. The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and all progressive mankind in the world sympathize with and support the Vietnamese people. We firmly believe that peace and happiness will surely spread throughout the evergreen land with the victory of the Vietnamese people.
    Long live the eternal friendship between the people of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China!
              Wu Yunduo, National Labor Model of China
  Letter from Geng Changsuo, Model Agricultural Laborer, to Vietnamese Farmers
    Dear Vietnamese Farmer Brothers:
    Vietnam and China are close neighbors, and there has always been a deep friendship between the two peoples. Since the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong led the entire Chinese people to overthrow the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, Chinese farmers have truly lived human lives. After four years of economic recovery and development, we are now advancing towards the bright road of socialism with full confidence. At the same time, the broad masses of Vietnamese farmer brothers, together with the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, established a democratic republic, resolutely resisted the aggressive war launched by French imperialism, and have achieved great victories. The farmer brothers of China and Vietnam were both liberated from the long-term rule of imperialism and domestic reactionaries, so the friendship between us is the closest.
    Recalling 1943, our Wu Gong Village suffered a severe drought, and the lives of many farmers were very difficult. At the same time, the Japanese invading army often came to our village to "mop up," and we needed to fight the enemy at any time, so we could not concentrate on production, and livestock and agricultural implements suffered a lot of damage in the war. But we resolutely followed the Communist Party, actively responded to Chairman Mao's call, organized ourselves, and worked hard to produce, and finally repelled the enemy's attacks, overcame various difficulties, and survived the famine.
    In 1946, because I did a good job in production and the quality was high, I was honorably elected as a model agricultural worker. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a counter-revolutionary civil war. In order to defend our new life, my son signed up to join the People's Liberation Army, and led many farmer brothers to actively join the army as well.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in 1953, our country basically completed the land reform. More than 300 million landless and land-poor farmers received 47 million hectares of land that previously belonged to the landlords, thus freeing them from the land rent of no less than 50 million tons of grain that they had to pay every year to rent the landlords' land in the past. At the same time, they also received some cattle and agricultural implements. For cattle alone, an average of one head could be distributed to every four to five households. This struggle was very fierce, and the victory was also great.
    Like the vast majority of Chinese farmers, most of the members of our agricultural production cooperative have received land and some means of production. Since then, our agricultural production cooperative has gradually expanded and consolidated. We have improved our farming techniques and applied more fertilizer, which has significantly increased yields. The income of our members has increased, and their lives have been greatly improved. The benefits of getting organized are endless. In 1951, I built three houses, and I live very well. Li Di'er, a member of our cooperative, did not produce enough grain in 1943 to eat for a year. Later, he joined our cooperative. From 1948 to now, he has had surplus grain every year, and he has long been free from worrying about food and clothing. Every year during festivals, his family of four also buys more than ten pounds of meat. In 1953, our cooperative celebrated its 10th anniversary, and the number of members has grown to 287 households. Although it was partially affected by floods, the average yield per mu still reached more than 300 jin, which is 34% higher than the average yield of nearby individual farmers. Now we have a total of 93 livestock and complete new and old agricultural implements in our cooperative. Everyone's labor enthusiasm is also very high. Soon the People's Government will set up a machine tractor station in our village. At that time, we can use machines to cultivate the land, and the efficiency and yield of cultivation will certainly be greatly improved. As long as we work actively, we will surely live a happy life like the farmer brothers of the Soviet collective farms in the future.
    Recently, I saw news in the newspaper that your National Assembly approved the Land Reform Law, which stipulates that land reform will be carried out from 1954, abolishing the land monopoly system of imperialists and the feudal system of land ownership by the landlord class, and realizing "land to the tiller." This is really exciting. From this, it can be seen that the great President Ho Chi Minh is very concerned about the lives of farmer brothers. I wish you greater victories in this movement. At the same time, I believe that all the farmer brothers in Vietnam, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, and striving to learn from labor heroes Huang Heng and Zheng Chunpei, will surely continue to increase production and increase income. Not long ago, a delegation from your country visited our cooperative. Although the time was very short, I deeply felt that the confidence of the representatives of your country in the victory of the struggle was extremely firm.
    Now the French imperialist war of aggression has suffered a shameful defeat. This is a great victory for the heroic struggle of the people of your country, and it is also a victory for the people of Asia and the people of the world. Today, the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has grown unprecedentedly, and imperialism is at the end of its rope. Your struggle will be warmly supported by the entire Chinese people and the people of the world, and the final victory will surely belong to you!

    向争取独立自由的英勇的越南人民致敬
    编者按：一月十八日是越南与各兄弟国家建立邦交的纪念日。越南民主共和国根据越苏友好协会与越中友好协会的建议，决定自这一天起举行越苏中友好月。越苏中友好月的举行，必将使越苏与越中人民之间的兄弟般的深厚友谊，得到进一步的巩固与发展。中国人民对此表示热烈的祝贺。本报这里发表的是中国人民志愿军一级英雄郭忠田等，全国工业劳动模范吴运铎和农业劳动模范耿长锁写给越南人民的祝贺信。
     中国人民志愿军一级英雄郭忠田等人给越南人民军的祝贺信英勇的越南人民军全体亲爱的同志们：
    你们为了自由独立和世界和平的正义事业，在越南劳动党、越南民主政府和胡志明主席的领导下，进行着神圣的反抗侵略的战争。七年来，你们取得了光辉的战绩，并在战斗中壮大了自己的队伍、丰富了斗争的经验，培养了大批的战斗英雄和模范工作者。这给了全世界爱好自由与和平的人民以莫大的鼓舞。这些伟大的成就是越南人民的光荣，也是全世界爱好和平人类的光荣！请接受我们兄弟般的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    我们是中国人民志愿军的战士，我们为了抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣任务而志愿地走上朝鲜前线与朝鲜人民军一道并肩抗击美帝国主义的疯狂进攻。三年以来，我们在金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员的指挥下，在朝鲜战场上打败了以美国为首的帝国主义侵略军，歼灭了敌人一百余万，毁伤敌机一万二千余架及各种舰艇二百余艘，夺获各种大炮六千余门及汽车、坦克车、装甲车近一万辆，取得了打败帝国主义侵略的丰富的战斗经验，大大地提高了我们的战斗力和保卫和平的信心，并出现了三十余万英雄模范和功臣。这些胜利是与朝鲜人民、中国人民和全世界人民的支持和鼓舞分不开的，是与你们的支持和鼓舞分不开的。因此，我们的胜利，同时也是你们和全世界人民共同的胜利。
    我们在朝鲜经常听到你们的胜利消息，这些消息给予我们极大的鼓舞。还在一九五○年的冬天，当我们刚刚进入朝鲜，在冰天雪地的清川江和长津湖畔痛歼美国第八军的时候，就听到你们边界战役胜利的消息；一九五一年当我们在汉江两岸阻击敌人，并开展群众性的对空射击敌机运动的时候，又连续听到你们四大战役胜利的消息；一九五二年春天，我们在粉碎敌人细菌战的胜利斗争中，听到了你们和平战役胜利的消息；同年冬天，我们在上甘岭一带大量杀伤敌人的时候，又听到了你们西北大捷的好消息。去年以来，你们的胜利越来越多，也越来越大，特别是你们最近不断粉碎美、法侵略者共同拟定的“纳瓦尔军事计划”，解放了为敌人所盘踞的重镇莱州。我们并知道你们在部队中开展了学习战斗英雄阮国治和甲文康小组的杀敌立功运动，打得敌人狼狈逃窜。所有这些胜利，使我们中国人民志愿军的战士都为之欢腾鼓舞。我们预祝你们取得最后的胜利。
    让我们向你们报告一些我们的情况吧。在过去三年抗美援朝的斗争中，中国人民志愿军的士气越来越高，装备越来越好，经验也越来越多。志愿军的战士是勇敢机智的，我们在战斗中不断克服困难，战胜敌人。例如：郭忠田的一个排，在过去的一次战斗中，就歼敌二百多人，夺获大炮六门，汽车五十八辆。空军战士张积慧，打掉了敌人的“王牌驾驶员”戴维斯。张积慧在一次战斗中炮弹打完了，就决心和敌机撞在一起，同归于尽，那个怕死的敌人被吓得慌忙俯冲，不料冲得太急，钻到冰里淹死了。战士黄家富在官岱里反击战中，连续执行十五次爆破任务，单独歼敌二百余名，并打开了部队前进的道路，为后续部队歼灭大批敌人创造了条件。我们还在前线以极大的艰忍精神和体力劳动，修建了地下坑道，使自己的阵地更加巩固。在上甘岭战役中，战士胡修道用手榴弹、爆破筒、炸药打退了敌人四十一次冲锋，单独歼敌二百八十多名。护士刘秀珍和她的一个排，以高度热爱伤病员的工作精神，护理了一千二百个伤员，使他们全部恢复了健康。
    朝鲜战场和越南战场的胜利事实，证明了帝国主义者在亚洲横行霸道的时代已经是一去不复返了。全世界爱好和平人民的力量，已经大大地超过了帝国主义的侵略势力。中国人民、朝鲜人民和越南人民都已经英勇地站起来了。全世界以苏联为首的和平民主阵营也无比地强大起来了。帝国主义集团的一切战争政策和侵略阴谋是注定了要失败的。
    亲爱的越南的兄弟们，你们不是孤立的，全世界爱好和平的人民都是你们的朋友。你们的斗争受到全体进步人类的同情和支持。我们中越两国是兄弟之邦，唇齿相依，我们也一定要继续支持你们的斗争。英勇地战斗吧，越南的兄弟们，最后胜利是一定属于你们的！
        致以兄弟般的敬礼！
      中国人民志愿军战士一级英雄郭忠田
                          一级英雄张积慧
                          一级英雄黄家富
                          一级英雄胡修道
                          二级模范刘秀珍
  全国工业劳动模范吴运铎给越南
    工人弟兄的信亲爱的越南工人同志们：
    中国人民以最深厚的情谊时刻地关怀着越南人民反侵略的正义斗争。这是因为我们曾长期有过共同的命运，经过同样艰苦奋斗的道路，并且因为我们两国人民很久以来就有着深厚的友谊，这种友谊在今天被国际主义精神团结得更加牢固了。
    勇于反抗侵略、又勇于建设的越南人民，在光荣的越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，已经获得了光辉的胜利。全世界爱好和平、自由和正义的人民，都为越南民主共和国成立以来所赢得的光辉成就感到衷心的喜悦。在我国的报纸刊物上，经常出现来自越南民主共和国的通讯报道和照片，在我们的电影院里也放映了关于越南人民英勇斗争的影片。这使我们能更真切地了解越南人民的生活和斗争。我们常常如身临其境地看到越南人民军穿过火网追击逃敌，看到越南的兵工工人在山林间坚持军火生产，印刷工人在印制“劳动报”。吴嘉嵌、高曰保这些模范工作者的名字，已经成为我们非常熟悉、非常亲切的名字，就像我们是多年以来并肩劳动的战友那样，虽然我们并不相识。
    我原先也是一个兵工工人。当我读到吴嘉嵌同志曾排除一切困难，提高军火工厂的产量八十五倍，并节省下许多工时、原料和燃料的时候，我就欢欣鼓舞地跳起来，好像这些卓越的成就是我们共同创造的。我深深地知道，争取独立自由的人们的任何创造性的劳动，都是对嗜血的侵略者的打击，都是热爱和平的人民的胜利。
    亲爱的同志们，中国人民也曾经历过艰苦斗争的日子。在抗日战争中，在人民解放战争中，中国工人曾以英雄的劳动，支援了革命斗争。那时，我所工作的新四军兵工厂设在一个荒无人烟的山沟里，有时也像你们一样拖着机器打游击。兵工厂在最初只有一个木风箱，几把钳子，和一些零星工具，根本没有现代化的机器。我们就凭手工制造出成批的刺刀、子弹、手榴弹、步枪、地雷、炮弹，交给我们的战士，消灭敌人。我们终于在党的领导下，逐渐从无到有，从小到大，在敌人的后方建立起了许多兵工厂。为了完成紧急的任务，我曾三次负伤，砸坏了左腿，炸断了左手的手指和右脚，炸瞎了左眼，全身伤口有一百多处。但是，即使面临死亡的威胁，我也没有离开战斗岗位。因为党教导了我，应该怎样生活；因为我深信，我们的正义事业必定胜利。党就是我坚强的战斗的力量源泉，就是我们的正义事业胜利的保证。
    一九四九年，中国人民革命取得了胜利。四年多来的时间，我们年青的中华人民共和国已经壮大起来了，并正在继续发展和壮大着。我们已迅速地恢复了国民经济，并胜利地进行了抗美援朝斗争。现在，我们又开始了大规模的和平建设，第一个五年建设计划将为我国的社会主义工业化奠定坚固的基础。我们党在过渡时期的总路线，已经成为中国人民的行动纲领。它就像灯塔一样照耀着我们前进的道路。它把全国人民团结在一个共同目标之下，为建成伟大的社会主义社会而斗争。在中国共产党和我们敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，在伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家真诚无私的援助下，我们正满怀信心地创造着幸福的明天。
    在这样的时刻，我们不能不百倍地关怀我们的亲兄弟——越南人民的斗争。刚刚获得解放的我们，是最容易理解你们热爱自由和平生活的意愿的。
    越南人民反对美国干涉者和法国侵略者的神圣斗争，永远不是孤立的，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营和全世界进步人类，都是同情和支持越南人民的。我们深信：和平与幸福必将随着越南人民的胜利遍及那四季长青的国土。
    越苏中三国人民之间的永恒友谊万岁！
              中国全国劳动模范　吴运铎
  农业劳动模范耿长锁给越南农民
    弟兄的信亲爱的越南农民弟兄们：
    越南和中国是近邻，两国人民之间向来就有着深厚的友谊。自从伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导全中国人民推翻了国民党反动派统治之后，中国农民才真正过着人的生活。经过四年来的经济恢复和发展，我们现正满怀信心地向着社会主义的光明大道前进。同时，广大的越南农民弟兄们，和越南人民在一起，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，建立了民主共和国，坚决抗击着法国帝国主义发动的侵略战争，并已取得了伟大的胜利。中、越两国的农民弟兄们都是从帝国主义和本国反动派的长期统治下解放出来的，因此，我们之间的友谊是最亲密不过的了。
    回想一九四三年的时候，我们五公村遭到了大旱灾，许多农民的生活非常困难；同时，日本侵略军常到我们村里来“扫荡”，需要随时和敌人进行战斗，不能安心生产，而耕畜和农具在战争中遭受大量破坏。但是我们坚决跟着共产党走，积极响应毛主席的号召，组织起来，努力生产，终于打退了敌人的进攻，克服了各种困难，渡过了灾荒。
    一九四六年，我因为生产搞的好，质量高，光荣地当选了农业劳动模范。当时，国民党反动派发动了反人民的内战，为着保卫我们的新生活，我的儿子报名参加了人民解放军，带动许多农民弟兄们也积极参了军。
    在中国共产党领导下，一九五三年我国基本上完成了土地改革，约有三万万以上无地和少地的农民分得了以前属于地主的四千七百万公顷的土地，因而使他们免除了过去为租种地主土地每年必须交纳的不下五千万吨粮食的地租。同时，他们也分到了一些耕牛和农具，只耕牛一项，平均每四至五户即可分到一头。这一斗争是非常激烈的，而胜利也是伟大的。
    和广大的中国农民一样，我们这个农业生产合作社的大部分社员都分到了土地和一些生产资料。从此我们的农业生产合作社就逐渐扩大和巩固了。我们改进了耕作技术，多上了肥料，使得产量有了显著的提高，社员们收入增多，生活也大大地得到改善了。组织起来的好处真是说不完。一九五一年，我盖了三间房子，住得很好。社员李第二在一九四三年生产的粮食，还不够一年吃的，后来加入了我们的合作社，从一九四八年到现在，每年都有余粮，早已不愁吃穿了，每逢年节，全家大小四口人还要买上十几斤肉。一九五三年我们社已成立了十周年，社员已发展到二百八十七户，虽然部分地受了涝灾，但平均每亩产量仍达到三百斤以上，超过附近单干农民的平均产量百分之三十四。现在我们社里共有九十三头牲口，新旧农具齐全。大家的劳动劲头也挺大。不久人民政府就将在我们的村庄设立机器拖拉机站，那时我们就可以利用机器耕种，耕作效率和产量当然都会大大提高。只要我们积极地干，将来一定会和苏联集体农庄的农民弟兄们一样过幸福的生活。
    最近我从报纸上看到消息说，贵国国民大会批准了土地改革法，规定从一九五四年开始进行土地改革，废除帝国主义者的土地垄断制度和地主阶级土地占有的封建制度，实现“耕者有其田”，这真是令人兴奋的事。从这里可以看出伟大的胡志明主席是非常关心农民弟兄们的生活的，我预祝您们在这一运动中获得更大的胜利。同时，我更相信全越南的农民弟兄们，在胡志明主席的领导下，并努力向劳动英雄黄亨和郑春沛学习，是一定会不断增加生产和增加收入的。不久以前，贵国代表团曾到我们合作社来参观，虽然时间很短，但我已深深感到了贵国代表们对斗争胜利的信心是万分坚定的。
    现在法帝国主义的侵略战争已遭到了可耻的失败，这是贵国人民英勇斗争的伟大胜利，也是亚洲人民和世界人民的胜利。今天，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量已空前壮大，帝国主义已经是日暮途穷了。你们的斗争将受到全中国和全世界人民的热烈支援，最后胜利一定是属于你们的！
