Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: According to TASS, Berlin, January 14th, "Neues Deutschland" published a conversation with Hans Seigewasser, Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Council of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic. Seigewasser said that since December 5, 1953, the local, district, city, and village committees of the National Council of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic have widely publicized the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Berlin to the people. As of January 11 this year, the local organizations of the National Front have received letters and resolutions with approximately 3.4 million signatures, expressing welcome to the Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference and wholeheartedly supporting the German people's efforts to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, withdraw occupying forces, demand the abandonment of the policy of implementing the "European Defense Community" treaty in West Germany, and strive for representatives from both East and West Germany to participate in the Berlin Conference.

Seigewasser pointed out that the political enthusiasm of the working people is very high because the issues to be discussed at the Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference are extremely important for the German people. Workers in state-owned enterprises have pledged to increase production. Employees of various factories and local councils have invited West German delegations to visit East Germany to show them the achievements of the German Democratic Republic and the dangers involved in the policy of remilitarizing West Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: TASS, Paris, January 14th: A communiqué published by the Standing Committee of the French National Peace Council emphasized that the upcoming Berlin Four-Power Conference is a great achievement in the peace movement.

The communiqué said: "Without France's consent, Germany cannot be armed. Therefore, the first contribution our country can make to ensure the success of this conference is to most resolutely oppose the militarization of Germany. France's independent stance and its initiative in this regard should play a decisive role in preparing the resolutions that will be passed on the basis of negotiations. Only negotiations can guarantee European security. It is important that those representing France at the Berlin Conference take into account the wishes of the people. Berlin should hear the voice of the entire French nation, not just the voice of a few officials who cannot reflect the interests of the nation." The Standing Committee called on all French people to intensify their opposition to the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties.

    民主德国人民欢迎举行柏林四国外长会议
    法国全国和平理事会号召加紧反对批准波恩和巴黎条约
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社柏林十四日讯：“新德意志报”刊载了民主德国全国阵线全国委员会常务委员会副主席汉斯·赛格瓦塞的一篇谈话。赛格瓦塞说，民主德国全国阵线全国委员会各地方、区、市和乡村委员会自一九五三年十二月五日以来，向人民广泛地宣传了即将在柏林举行的四国外长会议。到今年一月十一日为止，全国阵线各地组织已经接到约有三百四十万人签名的信件和决议，表示欢迎柏林外长会议，并衷心支持德国人民争取缔结对德和约、撤退占领军、要求抛弃在西德实行“欧洲防务集团”条约的政策、争取有东西德的代表参加柏林会议等。
    赛格瓦塞指出，劳动人民的政治积极性非常高，因为柏林外长会议将讨论的问题对于德国人民是极其重要的。国营企业的工人们保证增加生产。各工厂的职工们和各地方议会纷纷邀请西德代表团到东德来参观，告诉他们德意志民主共和国所取得的成就，以及使西德重新军国主义化的政策所包含的危险。
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：法国全国和平理事会常务委员会公布的公告着重说，即将召开的柏林四国代表会议是和平运动中的巨大成就。
    公告说：“没有法国的同意不能够武装德国，因此，我们国家可能保证这个会议成功的第一个贡献就是：最坚决地反对德国军国主义化。法国的独立立场和它在这方面的主动精神，应当在准备那些将在谈判的基础上通过的决议时起决定性的作用，只有进行谈判才有可能保证欧洲的安全。重要的是，在柏林会议上代表法国的那些人要考虑人民的这种愿望。柏林应当听到整个法国的声音，而不光是听一部分不能反映民族利益的官方人士的说话。”常务委员会号召全体法国人民加紧反对批准波恩与巴黎条约。
