    Anshan, China's steel capital, will begin larger-scale capital construction this year. Currently, the 1954 capital construction plan compiled by Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been approved by the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government. The engineering designs required for construction in the first quarter of this year have already been completed; some projects, such as the reconstruction of the third automated blast furnace and the construction of new employee dormitories, began construction ahead of schedule last year.
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's capital construction plan for this year is based on the national Five-Year Plan. Anshan Iron and Steel Company has more than 100 capital construction projects this year, of which more than 20 are major projects. The state's investment in various construction projects has increased by 3% compared to last year. Among the construction projects, the mechanical installation engineering, which represents the main workload, will increase by more than one-third this year compared to last year, and the concrete engineering will increase by nearly one-third. Among the major projects for the whole year, those required to be completed and put into operation within the year include the thin plate plant, the third automated blast furnace, coking ovens No. 13 and 14, and more than 300,000 square meters of employee dormitories; the projects that are required to start construction this year but cannot be completed until the next year include the newly built, expanded, and renovated Dahushan crushing and screening yard, the second magnetic separation plant, the second sintering plant, the fourth automated blast furnace, the second steelmaking plant, the first section rolling mill, the second section rolling mill, the clay brick workshop and silica brick workshop of the refractory material plant, the coal storage yard, the second recovery plant for coke oven gas, the tar plant, the general machinery plant, and the metal structure plant. After the new thin plate plant and the reconstructed third blast furnace are completed and put into production this year, Anshan Iron and Steel will be able to produce more pig iron and thin steel plates of various specifications to meet the needs of national economic construction and national defense construction.
    One of the characteristics of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's capital construction this year is the significant increase in the number of newly started projects. These projects, such as mining beneficiation, coking, recovery, ironmaking, steelmaking, steel rolling, refractory materials, and railway engineering, are almost all new projects. Most of these projects are required to be constructed this year and completed in 1955 or 1956. The second characteristic of this year's capital construction is the large number of engineering projects for capital construction auxiliary enterprises, and the construction of these auxiliary enterprises is to prepare conditions for the construction in the last three years of the first Five-Year Plan.

### 鞍钢将开始更大规模的基本建设

    鞍钢将开始更大规模的基本建设
    我国钢都鞍山，今年将要开始更大规模的基本建设。目前，鞍山钢铁公司编制的一九五四年基本建设计划，已经中央人民政府重工业部批准。今年第一季度需要施工的工程设计早已经作好；有的工程如改建第三座自动化炼铁炉和新建部分职工宿舍等工程，早在去年就提前施工了。
    鞍山钢铁公司今年的基本建设计划，是根据国家五年建设计划制订出来的。鞍山钢铁公司今年基本建设的工程项目有一百多个，其中有二十多个是主要项目。国家向各个建设工程的投资比去年增加了百分之三。在建设工程中，代表主要工作量的机械安装工程，今年比去年增加三分之一多，混凝土工程增加将近三分之一。全年主要工程项目中，要求在年内竣工的有薄板厂、第三座自动化炼铁炉、第十三号、十四号炼焦炉和三十多万平方公尺的职工宿舍等工程；要求今年开工建设必须跨年度才能竣工的工程，有新建、扩建和改建的大弧山破碎筛分场，第二磁选场，第二烧结厂，第四座自动化炼铁炉，第二炼钢厂，第一分轧厂和第二分轧厂，耐火材料厂的粘土砖车间和矽砖车间，贮煤场，焦炉瓦斯第二回收场，焦油厂，机械总厂和金属结构厂等。新建的薄板厂和改建的第三座炼铁炉，在今年内建设完工并投入生产后，将使鞍钢生产更多的生铁和各种规格的薄钢板，供应国家经济建设和国防建设的需要。
    鞍山钢铁公司今年基本建设的特点之一，是新开始施工的工程显著增多。这些工程中如矿山选矿、炼焦、回收、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、耐火材料和铁路工程，几乎都是新建工程。这些工程，大部分要求在今年施工，到一九五五年或一九五六年建设成功。今年基本建设的第二个特点，是基本建设附属企业的工程多，而这些附属企业的建设，又都是为第一个五年计划后三年建设准备条件的。
