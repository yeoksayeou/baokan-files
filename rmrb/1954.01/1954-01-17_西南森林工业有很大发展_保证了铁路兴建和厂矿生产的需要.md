The southwest region's forest industry experienced significant development in 1953. The Southwest Forest Industry Department improved production management and operational methods, resulting in increased production quotas for all types of work compared to 1952. Logging increased by 48 percent, timber collection by 10.2 percent, land transportation by 11.5 percent, and rafting by 13.3 percent. The timber harvesting plan for the entire region was fulfilled by 124 percent, and the timber transportation plan was approximately 95 percent completed.

Southwest China's forest resources are distributed in border regions, with long transportation distances. Relying entirely on manual labor created significant difficulties in production, transportation, and supply. However, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the vast number of workers labored selflessly, and farmers of all ethnic groups provided enthusiastic support. Over the past few years, the Southwest forest industry has basically guaranteed the country's construction timber needs and has regulated civilian needs. The wood from eastern and southern Sichuan and Guizhou has guaranteed the supply of timber for Chongqing and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, as well as some coal mine pit props and papermaking raw materials. The timber from western Sichuan has supported Chengdu's construction. Most of northern Sichuan produces railway sleepers to meet the needs of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Before 1953, the Southwest forest industry only carried out sporadic production in scattered forest areas. With the needs of national construction, in mid-1953, most production units had entered the primitive forest areas for centralized production. The Bureau and its branches also organized forest survey teams to investigate forest resources sufficient for several years of production, and most of the workers have become permanent workers from seasonal workers. This has prepared the conditions for future expansion of production in terms of resources, manpower, and base, and has provided favorable conditions for guaranteeing the construction timber for various cities in Southwest China, as well as the current Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the future Chengdu-Kunming Railway.

    西南森林工业有很大发展
    保证了铁路兴建和厂矿生产的需要
    一九五三年西南区森林工业有了很大的发展。西南森林工业部门由于改进了生产管理和操作方法，使各个工种的生产定额都比一九五二年有所提高：如采伐提高了百分之四十八，集材提高百分之十点二，陆运提高百分之十一点五，放筏提高百分之十三点三。全区的木材采伐计划完成了百分之一百二十四，运材计划完成百分之九十五左右。
    西南的森林资源都分布在边沿地区，运程很远，在完全依赖人力操作的情况下，就形成了生产运输和供应上的很大困难。但在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，广大职工忘我地劳动，各族农民热情地支援，几年来西南森林工业基本上保证了国家建设用材并调剂了民间需要。川东、川南及贵州的部分木材保证供应了重庆和成渝铁路的用材，以及部分煤矿坑木和造纸原料。川西的木材支持了成都的建设。川北大部分是生产枕木，供应宝成铁路的需要。一九五三年以前，西南森林工业还只是在散生林区进行零星生产，随着国家建设的需要，一九五三年中各生产单位大都已进入原始林区，进行集中生产。管理局和各分局也组织了森林调查队，调查了足够几年生产的森林资源，工人也大部分由季节工人成为固定工人。这样就为今后的扩大生产准备了资源、人力和基地等条件，并为保证西南各城市建设用材及目前的宝成铁路和今后的成昆铁路用材提供了有利条件。
