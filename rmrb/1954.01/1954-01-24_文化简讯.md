Cultural Briefs

    Chinese Artists Association's journal "Fine Arts" Launched
    The inaugural issue of "Fine Arts," the journal of the Chinese Artists Association, was published on the 15th.

    The purpose of launching "Fine Arts" is to promote creation, research, criticism, and other activities in fine arts work, to carry forward the realistic traditions of national fine arts, and to learn from the Soviet socialist realism art theory and creative experience, so as to improve the ideological and artistic level of fine arts work in our country.

    In the future, "Fine Arts" will not only pay attention to providing learning materials for professional art workers in terms of article and artwork editing, but also pay attention to being suitable for reading by general art enthusiasts.

      Chinese Dramatists Association's journal "Drama News" Launched
    "Drama News," the journal of the Chinese Dramatists Association, was launched in Beijing on the 20th.

    The purpose of launching "Drama News" is to meet the urgent needs of drama workers across the country in their political and professional studies. The Chinese Dramatists Association will use "Drama News" to introduce and criticize drama works and performances, and to systematically introduce the realistic traditions of Chinese drama art and the creative theories and performing arts of Soviet socialist realism, in order to guide drama activities across the country.

      "Peking Opera Series" Edited by the Chinese Opera Research Institute Published
    With the help of the Arts Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, the Chinese Opera Research Institute has compiled a batch of Peking Opera scripts, which have now been compiled into "Peking Opera Series" and published in volumes by Shanghai New Literature and Art Publishing House.

    Most of these plays are currently popular on stage and welcomed by the masses, but they also include a small number of traditional plays that are not currently popular but have excellent content and performing arts; there are also some Kunqu opera scripts that are relatively popular on the Peking Opera stage. These scripts can be used as a reference for Peking Opera troupes across the country when formulating their performance repertoire plans; they can also be used as a reference for literary and art circles and opera enthusiasts to study national literary heritage.

    Most of these revised plays have been experimentally performed by the China Peking Opera Troupe.
