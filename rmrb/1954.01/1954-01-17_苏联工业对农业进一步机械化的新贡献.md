New Contributions of Soviet Industry to Further Mechanization of Agriculture
Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Moscow, Xie Wenqing

Soviet agriculture has long been equipped with modern machinery on the basis of a strong socialist industry. There are currently 8,950 machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union, concentrating various types of powerful agricultural machinery. This has made socialist agriculture the most advanced agriculture in the world, with the highest level of mechanization, the fullest utilization of new achievements in modern agricultural science. In 1952 alone, Soviet socialist industry supplied agriculture with 131,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 41,000 grain combine harvesters, 57,000 trucks, and over 2 million other agricultural machines of various types. One of the most important ways to further develop agriculture is to further mechanize and even fully mechanize agricultural production processes with the help of a strong socialist industry. Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, pointed out in his report "On Measures for Further Development of Soviet Agriculture": "Agricultural machine tractor stations play a major and decisive role in the work of further developing agriculture." The mechanization of agricultural cultivation not only reduces human labor but is also a necessary condition for fully utilizing the achievements of modern agricultural science. Therefore, Comrade Khrushchev also pointed out: "Agricultural machine tractor stations should complete the mechanization of the planting of grain and industrial raw material crops" and "apply the achievements of science and advanced experience to the production of collective farms."

Currently, the powerful Soviet industry is producing a large number of new agricultural machines for agriculture at an even faster pace. Various types of new machines are constantly appearing in the fields of collective farms and on livestock farms, which is a prelude to the further upsurge of socialist agriculture. Soviet industry has manufactured various new machines suitable for cultivating, harvesting, and transporting tall crops (millet, corn, sunflower, etc.) and short crops (vegetables, root crops, etc.); new machines for transporting fertilizer, fertilizing, draining water, cutting grass, stacking grass, and excavating are also being manufactured in large quantities. Here are just a few of the new machines that mechanize strenuous labor and other work in agricultural production.

In the potato harvesting process, strenuous labor is relatively high, and its level of mechanization is much lower than that of grain production in the Soviet Union. If the sowing and harvesting of grain in Soviet agriculture is almost fully mechanized, then the mechanization of potato planting work is only 14 percent, while the harvesting work is only 6 percent mechanized. Now, Soviet agricultural machinery designers have successfully solved this problem. The All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Agricultural Machinery Research Institute have newly designed a four-row potato planter for square-cluster planting, called "SKG-4." This machine, combined with the "KKR-2" potato harvesting combine produced by the Lison Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant, can fully mechanize the potato production process. Last year, these two machines have been used in the fields of many collective farms. One of the most important ways to increase the yield per unit area of potatoes is to plant potatoes by the square-cluster planting method. Using the "SKG-4" potato planter to plant potatoes can fully mechanize the work of intertillage, weeding, and harvesting. This machine consists of two identical parts; each part has a feeding hopper, a funnel, a furrow opener, a pit digger, a filter, and fertilization and covering devices. The furrow opener digs a ditch in the ground, and the pit digger digs pits. The seed potatoes pass through the feeding hopper and funnel, and two or three pieces are dropped into each pit. The rows are evenly spaced, each being 70 centimeters apart. At the same time, the fertilizer device applies granular mineral fertilizer to the pits. Finally, the covering device covers the pits.

The "KKR-2" potato harvesting combine is suitable for harvesting potatoes planted by the square-cluster planting method. Harvesting potatoes is the most strenuous labor in the entire potato production process, accounting for 40 percent of the strenuous labor in the entire potato production process. At the same time, if the harvesting work is not done well, many potatoes may be lost in the field. If the harvest is slow, some potatoes may be frozen in the field before harvesting. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, the work of harvesting potatoes must be "fast and good." The "KKR-2" harvesting combine can solve this problem. It can harvest in dry, hard fields that have not had rain for a long time, remove the soil sticking to the potatoes, and load the potatoes onto the trailer behind the machine. Four people stand on the pedals on both sides of the machine, picking out the stones and debris from the harvested potatoes and putting them into special baskets. At the end of the field, the machine automatically pours out the stones and debris in the baskets. It can harvest four to five hectares of potatoes every ten hours (each hectare is equal to 15 mu). The factories in the Soviet Union are now manufacturing these two machines, "SKG-4" and "KKR-2," in large quantities.

Due to the use of powerful agricultural machines, some field work in Soviet socialist agriculture can also be carried out using assembly line operations, just like in factories. The process of planting and harvesting grains using assembly line operations is one example: The combine harvester harvests the grain in the front, cleans, dries, and loads the grain onto trucks to transport it into the warehouse. Behind the combine, the collection machine and stacking machine collect and transport the grain stalks, weeds, etc. left in the field and stack them up. Then, the tractor pulls the plowing machine to start plowing. The work of transporting fertilizer, fertilizing, sowing, etc. in the following year is also done in sequence by machines. Timely harvesting, clearing the fields, and plowing using this assembly line operation play an important role in increasing the yield per unit area. This is because, firstly, it can eliminate the loss of grain during harvesting and transportation; secondly, it can preserve moisture; thirdly, it can maintain the juice of the stalks so that they can become good feed for livestock; fourthly, it can eliminate weeds, because the stalks and seeds of weeds have been removed from the field. This assembly line operation can also be used when sowing and harvesting corn. However, corn grows particularly tall, so a special combine harvester was also manufactured for it. After this combine drives through a field full of tall corn, the field is cleared up completely. The combine cleans and dries the corn kernels and loads them onto trucks to transport them into the warehouse. At this time, the stalks and leaves of the corn are also cut into fragments, loaded onto the trailer behind the machine, and pulled back to feed the cattle. This machine can harvest corn that is twelve feet tall, and can harvest five hectares a day, without losing a single corn kernel or a single blade of grass in the field.

The sowing of sugar beets in the Soviet Union has long been 95 percent mechanized, but the level of mechanization of harvesting work is still relatively low, and the main strenuous labor is in the harvesting work. The recently improved "SKEM-3" sugar beet harvesting combine in the Soviet Union has completely mechanized the sugar beet harvesting work. In the past, the disadvantage of this machine was that it placed the harvested sugar beets in the field, and then manual labor was used to pick them into piles, peel off the soil, and load them onto trucks. Therefore, the harvesting speed was slow, and it was inevitable that some sugar beets would be lost in the field. The improved "SKEM-3" sugar beet harvesting combine overcomes these shortcomings, linking the processes of harvesting, peeling, and transporting together, greatly speeding up the harvesting speed and saving 100 man-days per day. Because the harvesting period of sugar beets is shortened, it is possible to postpone harvesting for ten days (otherwise, postponing for ten days will freeze them). If sugar beets grow in the field for ten more days, 30 to 40 quintals more can be harvested per hectare. In this way, the mechanization of sugar beet harvesting work alone can increase the national harvest by several million poods of sugar beets each year (one pood equals 32.76 catties). In order to increase the yield of vegetables, the Soviet Union has also manufactured new vegetable seeders, seedling planting machines, and harvesting machines. Cultivating vegetable seedlings with peat humus clods can not only greatly increase vegetable yields but also make vegetables mature earlier. However, the required number of clods is very large, and manual production cannot meet the needs. Therefore, the Soviet Union manufactured automatic lathes specifically for manufacturing peat humus clods to replace manual labor. This machine consists of a mixer, a metering device, and a molding device. In the machine, the peat soil is mixed with fertilizer and then made into clods like mud nests, each clod having a volume of six or eight cubic centimeters. One automatic lathe can manufacture 9,000 small clods or 3,500 large clods per hour. By this year, every collective farm in the Soviet Union can use this lathe. After planting seedlings in peat humus clods, there is another machine called the "Four-Row Seedling Planting Machine" that plants them in the field. This machine has water and fertilizer supply devices, and there are mud clods with seedlings on the pedals on both sides of the machine, as well as more than a dozen seats. When the machine is started, it moves straight forward, the furrow opener digs the soil, and the people sitting on the machine only need to place the mud clods on a certain device, and the machine will automatically plant a mud clod with seedlings every 60-70 centimeters. Fertilizer and water are also poured into the pit at the same time. Then, the covering device behind the machine covers the seedlings. Each of these machines can plant four hectares of vegetables a day.

The "Belarusian" universal diesel engine tractor is truly a versatile tool in farming. It can tow various types of tillage machines, such as plowing machines, cultivating machines, seeding machines, and inter-row cultivating machines for crops sown by the square-cluster planting method. It can work not only in fields of short crops (such as potatoes, etc.) but also in fields of tall crops (such as sunflowers, etc.). It has 37 horsepower and can travel at five different speeds, from four and a half kilometers per hour to thirteen kilometers per hour. Whether it goes fast or slow depends on what kind of work it is doing. This machine also has a hydraulic device, which can quickly turn, raise, or lower various working machines connected to it at the end of the field. It can also clean and dry seeds. The workers of the Minsk Tractor Factory recently held a mobilization meeting specifically for mass-producing "Belarusian" universal diesel engine tractors. They decided to supply agriculture with this excellent machine at the fastest speed.

In agricultural production, in addition to plowing, sowing, harvesting, mowing, and stacking grass, there is another very important but very strenuous work, which is transporting and applying fertilizer. The newly manufactured "UTL-7" fertilizer transport and spreading machine in the Soviet Union has solved this problem. Collective farmers everywhere have highly praised the effectiveness of this machine. Using a loading machine to load fertilizer (manure, peat, and mineral fertilizer, etc.) onto this machine, the machine transports the fertilizer to the field. It can evenly spread and spray various fertilizers in the field before sowing and intertillage. Its volume is seven cubic meters, and its carrying capacity is five tons. Depending on the amount of fertilizer to be applied, it can spread and spray fertilizer at twenty different speeds, spreading and spraying seven cubic meters of fertilizer in seven minutes at the fastest, and taking three hours to spread and spray at the slowest. The most wonderful thing is that after loading the machine with lumpy manure, etc., the machine can loosen, grind, and mix these lumpy manures, and then weigh them with a weighing device before spreading and spraying them according to the quantity. The fertilizer spreading mechanism can rotate 270 to 540 revolutions per minute. If it rotates 270 revolutions per minute, it can spread and spray the fertilizer to a distance of six meters. If it rotates 540 revolutions, it can spread and spray the fertilizer to a distance of nine or ten meters. To load fertilizer onto this machine, a versatile articulated loading and unloading machine is used. It can load 54 tons of fertilizer per hour. With these machines, the arduous and heavy manure transportation and spreading work of collective farmers can be done by machines.

Another important sector of agricultural production is livestock farming. There are also many machines in Soviet livestock farms. Among them, the most important is the machine for making feed. Because the most strenuous labor on livestock farms is making and transporting feed. The feed must be made fine and cooked thoroughly so that the livestock likes to eat it and gains weight easily after eating it. However, in the large-scale collective agricultural livestock farms of socialism, it is not only impossible to make feed manually, but it is also impossible to make it well. For example, in a medium-sized pig farm, at least five to six tons of feed must be made every day. It is impossible to make so much pig feed without machines. In the Soviet Union, machines have long been used to make feed in livestock farms, but these machines are not perfect enough. Recently, the Soviet Union has manufactured a universal feed making combine, which is mainly used by pig farms. To what extent is it universal? A look at its functions will tell: This machine is divided into two parts, one part is responsible for washing and cooking root feed (potatoes, radishes, etc.) with water, and the other part is responsible for chopping and grinding grass feed (hay, etc.) into powder. Then, the two are mixed and stirred together and flow into the crane. The crane automatically transports the feed along the overhead track (a device for transporting feed) set up in the pen and pours the feed into the trough. This machine only needs one person to operate, takes up only four square meters of space, and can make 475 kilograms of potatoes into pig feed in one hour. Because the feed it makes is fine and soft, the pigs like to eat it very much, and it is also easy to gain weight after eating it. It can be seen from this that the mechanization of livestock work can not only reduce labor but also increase the output of livestock products.

The above are just a few of the many new agricultural machines recently produced by Soviet industry. It can be seen from these new achievements in socialist agricultural machinery that a powerful industry is so important for the development of agriculture. Whatever machines agriculture needs, factories design and manufacture them. The further mechanization of agriculture can guarantee the rapid development of socialist agriculture, which is an important condition for the further upsurge of socialist agriculture.

    苏联工业对农业进一步机械化的新贡献
    新华社驻莫斯科记者　谢文清
    苏联农业早已在强大的社会主义工业基础上，用现代化机器装备起来。苏联现有八千九百五十个机器拖拉机站，在这些机器拖拉机站中，集中着各种各样效能强大的农业机器。这使得社会主义的农业早就成为世界上机械化水平最高的、最充分地利用着现代农业科学新成就的、最先进的农业。单是一九五二年，苏联社会主义工业就供给农业十三万一千部拖拉机（每部以十五匹马力计算），四万一千部谷物收割联合机，五万七千辆载重汽车和二百万部以上的其它各种农业机器。进一步发展农业的最重要的方法之一，就是在强大的社会主义工业的帮助下，使农业生产过程进一步机械化以至全盘机械化。苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志在“关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施”的报告中曾经指出：“农业机器拖拉机站在进一步发展农业的工作中起着主要的和有决定性的作用。”农业耕作的机械化不仅能减轻人的劳动，而且也是充分利用现代农业科学成就的必要条件，因此，赫鲁晓夫同志又指出：“农业机器拖拉机站要完成谷物和工业原料作物种植工作的机械化”，并“把科学的成就和先进的经验运用到集体农庄的生产中”去。
    目前，强大的苏联工业正以更快的速度为农业生产着大量的新式农业机器。在集体农庄的田野上和饲畜场内，不断出现着各种类型的新式机器，这是社会主义农业进一步高涨的先声。苏联工业已经制造出适用于做高棵作物（小米、玉蜀黍、向日葵等）和低棵作物（蔬菜、块根作物等）的各种耕作、收割、运送等工作的新机器；用作运肥、施肥、排水、切草、垛草、挖掘的新机器也正在大批制造出来。这里只介绍几种使农业生产中的费力劳动和其他工作机械化的新式机器。
    在马铃薯的收获过程中，费力劳动是比较多的，其机械化的水平，在苏联也比谷物生产的机械化水平低得多。如果说苏联农业在谷物的播种和收割方面几乎已全盘机械化，那么，马铃薯栽种工作的机械化程度仅达百分之十四，而其收获工作则仅有百分之六机械化。现在，苏联的农业机器设计师们已胜利地解决了这个问题。全苏列宁农业科学院、农业机器研究所新设计了一种供正方穴播用的四行马铃薯栽种机，它的名字叫“斯克格—四”，这种机器和利森农业机器制造厂所生产的“克克尔—二”马铃薯收获联合机相结合，就可以使马铃薯生产过程全盘机械化。去年，在许多集体农庄的田野上，已经采用了这两种机器。提高马铃薯的单位面积产量的最重要方法之一，是用正方穴播法栽种马铃薯。使用“斯克格—四”马铃薯栽种机栽种马铃薯，可以使中耕、除草和收获工作全盘机械化。这种机器由两个相同的部分组成；每一部分有一个供料桶、一个漏斗、一个开沟器、一个挖坑器、一个过滤器和施肥、掩盖等装置。开沟器在地上掘开沟，挖坑器就挖坑，作种用的马铃薯经过供料桶和漏斗等，就在每个坑中落下两三块。行间相距匀称，各为七十公分。与此同时，施肥装置就把粒状的矿质肥料施放到坑内。末了，掩盖装置就把坑盖好。
  “克克尔—二”马铃薯收获联合机就适用于收获用正方穴播法栽种的马铃薯。收获马铃薯是马铃薯全部生产过程中最费力的劳动，它占马铃薯全部生产过程费力劳动的百分之四十。同时，如果作不好收获工作，就可能使不少马铃薯丢失在田里，如收获得慢了，还可能使一部分马铃薯在未收获前就冻坏在田里。所以在苏联，收获马铃薯工作必须“又快、又好”。“克克尔—二”收获联合机就能解决这个问题。它能在久未落雨的干硬的田地上收获，能把粘在马铃薯上的泥土去掉并把马铃薯装到机器后面的拖车上去。有四个人站在机器两边的踏板上，把收下的马铃薯中的石块和杂物捡出来放到特设的篓子中。到地头时，机器就自动把篓中的石块和杂物倒出。每十小时可以收获四到五公顷马铃薯（每公顷合十五市亩）。现在苏联的工厂正在大批制造“斯克格—四”和“克克尔—二”这两种机器。
    由于使用效力强大的农业机器，苏联社会主义农业中的一些田间工作，也像在工厂中一样可以采用流水作业法进行。用流水作业法种植和收割谷物的过程就是一个例子：收割联合机在前头收割谷物，并把粮食清洁、烘干再装上汽车运进仓库，在联合机后面，收集机和垛草机把留在田里的谷物茎秆和杂草等收集、运走并堆垛起来。接着，拖拉机就拖上犁田机开始翻耕。下一年的运肥、施肥、播种等工作又是按顺序用机器来做。用这种流水作业法及时地收割、清除田地和翻耕，对于提高单位面积产量有着重要的作用。因为这样一则可以消灭谷物在收割和转运当中的损失；二则可以保墒；三则可以保持茎秆的汁液，使它能成为牲畜的好饲料；四则可以消灭杂草，因为杂草的茎秆和种籽已被从田中清除掉。播种和收获玉蜀黍时，也可以用这种流水作业法进行。但是，玉蜀黍长得特别高，所以又专门为它制造了一种收割联合机。这种联合机，从长满高高的玉蜀黍的田里开过去后，田地上就被它收拾得一干二净。联合机把玉蜀黍的颗粒弄干净，烘干后就装上汽车运入仓库，在这时候，玉蜀黍的秆和叶也被切成碎片，装到机器后面的拖车上，拉回去喂牛。这种机器可以收一丈二尺高的玉蜀黍，一天可收五公顷，一粒玉米，一根草也不丢在田里。
    甜菜播种工作在苏联有百分之九十五早已机械化了，但收获工作的机械化水平还比较低，而主要的费力劳动正是在收割工作中。最近苏联改善了的“斯克叶姆—三”甜菜收割联合机，已使甜菜收割工作完全机械化。过去，这种机器的缺点是把甜菜收下后就放在田里，然后再用人工来捡成堆，剥去泥土并装上汽车。因此收获速度慢，并难免要丢失一部分甜菜在田里。改善后的“斯克叶姆—三”甜菜收割联合机就克服了这些缺点，把收割、剥土、装运过程连在一起，收割速度加快了许多，每天可节省一百个人工。因为甜菜的收获期限缩短了，便可推迟十天收（否则，推迟十天就会冻坏）。而甜菜在田里多长十天，每公顷就可以多收三十到四十公担。这一来，单是甜菜收获工作的机械化，就可使全国每年多收几百万普特的甜菜（一普特合三二点七六市斤）。为了提高蔬菜的产量，苏联还制造出新的蔬菜播种机、栽植秧苗机和收割机。用泥炭腐植泥块培育菜秧，不但可以大大提高蔬菜产量，而且可使蔬菜提早成熟。但泥块的需要数量很大，用人工制造供不上需要。于是，苏联就制造出专门制造泥炭腐植泥块的自动车床来代替人工。这种机器由混合器、计量器和制模器等部分组成。在机器中，泥炭土质与肥料混合搅拌后，就被制成像泥窝窝一样的泥块，每个泥块的体积为六或八立方公分。一部自动车床一小时可以制造九千个小的或三千五百个大的泥块。到今年，全苏联每个集体农庄都可使用这种车床。在泥炭腐植泥块中栽上秧苗后，又有一种叫作“四行栽种秧苗机”的机器把它们栽种到田里去。这种机器上有供水和施肥装置，机器两边的踏板上放着培有秧苗的泥块，并有十多个座位。机器开动时笔直前进，开沟器把泥土挖开，坐在机器上的人只要把泥块放置在一定的装置上，机器就自动每隔六十—七十公分栽下一块培有秧苗的泥块，肥料和水也同时灌入坑中。接着，机器后面的掩盖装置就把秧苗掩盖起来。每部这种机器一天可以栽种四公顷蔬菜。
    “贝拉鲁斯式”万能柴油引擎拖拉机真是农作中的万能工具。它能拖带各式各样的耕作机，如犁田机、耘土机、播种机和用正方穴播法播种的农作物的行间中耕机等等。它不仅能在低棵作物（如马铃薯等）的田里工作，而且能在高棵作物（如向日葵等）的田里工作。它具有三十七匹马力，可以用五种不同的速度行驶，每小时能走四公里半或十三公里。它走快或走慢，要看作什么活来决定。这种机器还有水压装置，到地头时，这种装置可以使连挂在它后面的各种工作机迅速转弯，升高或降低。它还可以清洁和烘干种籽。明斯克拖拉机工厂的工人最近专门为大批制造“贝拉鲁斯式”万能柴油引擎拖拉机开了动员大会。他们决定以最快的速度供给农业这种优良的机器。
    在农业生产中，除犁田、播种、收割、割草、垛草等工作外，还有一项顶要紧但却顶费劲的工作，就是运肥料和施肥。苏联新近制造的“乌特尔—七”运肥施肥机已解决了这个问题。各地集体农民非常称赞这种机器的效能。用装车机把肥料（厩肥、泥炭和矿质肥料等）装到这种机器上，机器就把肥料运到田里，它能在播种和中耕之前把各种肥料很均匀地撒、喷到田里。它的体积是七立方公尺，载重量是五吨。根据施肥量的多少，它可以用二十种不同的速度撒、喷肥料，最快时可以在七分钟内把七立方公尺的肥料撒、喷出去，最慢时要三个钟头才能撒、喷完。最妙的是，把成块的厩肥等装上机器之后，机器就能把这些成块的厩肥耙松，磨碎、搅拌，然后又由称量器称量后再按分量撒、喷出去。撒肥的机件每分钟可以转二百七十到五百四十转。要是每分钟转二百七十转，就能把肥料撒、喷到六公尺远，要是转五百四十转，就能把肥料撒、喷到九公尺或十公尺远。要把肥料装上这种机器，那就由一种万能连挂装卸机来作。它每小时可以装载五十四吨肥料。有了这些机器，集体农民既费劲又繁重的厩肥运输和撒播工作，就可以由机器来干了。
    农业生产的另一重要部门是饲畜业。苏联饲畜场中也有许多机器。其中最主要的是制作饲料的机器。因为在饲畜场中最费力的劳动就是制作和运送饲料。饲料要作得细，煮得烂，牲口才喜欢吃，吃了才容易长肥。但在社会主义大规模集体农业的饲畜场内，要用人工制作饲料不仅来不及，而且作不好。比如在一个中等的养猪场内，每天至少也要制作五吨到六吨饲料，要制作这样多的猪食，离了机器就不行。在苏联，饲畜场中早就用机器制作饲料，不过这些机器还不够完善，最近苏联已制造出一种万能饲料制作联合机，这种机器主要是养猪场用的。它究竟万能到怎样的程度呢？看一看它的功能就知道了：这种机器分成两部分，一部分负责把块根饲料（马铃薯、萝卜等）洗净并加水煮熟，另一部分负责把草饲料（干草等）切碎磨成粉。然后两下混合搅拌，流进吊车中，吊车就沿着畜栏内架设的架空道（一种运送饲料的装置）自动运到猪槽上面，把饲料倒在槽内。这种机器只要一个人操作，占的地方只有四平方公尺，一小时就能把四百七十五公斤的马铃薯制成猪食。因为它制作的饲料又细又软，猪很喜欢吃，而且吃了也容易长膘。由这可以看出：饲畜工作的机械化，不仅可以减轻劳动，而且可以提高畜产品的产量。
    上面谈到的只是苏联工业最近出产的许多新农业机器中的几种。从社会主义农业机器方面的这些新成就可以看出，强大的工业对于发展农业是多么重要。农业需要什么机器，工厂就设计和制造什么机器。农业的进一步机械化，就可以保证社会主义农业的迅速发展，这是社会主义农业进一步高涨的重要条件。
