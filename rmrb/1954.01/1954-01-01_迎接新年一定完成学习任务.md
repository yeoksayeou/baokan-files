    Must Complete Study Tasks to Greet the New Year
    Hao Jianxiu, Student of the Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School Attached to the Renmin University of China, National Model Worker of the Textile Industry

    The great New Year of 1954 has arrived.
    In the past year, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our great motherland started its first Five-Year Plan and successfully passed the first year. How exciting this is!
    I have been studying at school this year. When I reported my study situation to the motherland and Chairman Mao, I couldn't help but recall the many sufferings of the past when I had no education: When the factory's administration issued a questionnaire, I couldn't even understand it, let alone fill it out; when others asked me to introduce my fine yarn work experience, I was very embarrassed because I only knew how to do it, but couldn't explain it; what was most urgent was visiting the Soviet Union, where there was a wealth of valuable experience everywhere. I wanted so much to write it all down and pass it on to the people of the motherland! But I could only memorize a little in my head. So, I made the greatest determination to study culture well.
    A year of study has increased my knowledge a lot: In the past, I couldn't read newspapers very clearly, but now I can read the poems of Du Fu and Bai Juyi, and the articles of Mr. Lu Xun; in the past, I didn't even understand that two-fourths and one-half were equal, but now I have learned junior high school algebra and geometry; in the past, I only knew to put oil and copper sand in the axles of machines, but I didn't know why, but now I understand the principle from physics class; in the past, there were many puzzling things, such as not understanding why there was wind and rain, why there was spring, summer, autumn, and winter, but now I understand all of them; in the past, I didn't know that the motherland was so vast, nor did I know that the history of the motherland was so long, but now I understand all these, and therefore, I feel even more deeply the greatness and loveliness of our motherland. Recently, we studied the General Line, and we have a clearer understanding of the future of our country. We must work hard in all aspects to build our motherland into a prosperous and strong socialist country. At that time, our motherland will be even greater and more lovable!
    I remember that last June, when Chairman Mao received the presidium of the Second National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, he kindly instructed us to achieve "good health, good study, and good work." For more than half a year, I have kept Chairman Mao's instructions firmly in mind at all times. While I was studying hard, I also insisted on physical exercise, and as a result, my body is healthier than before.
    When I reported to the motherland and Chairman Mao, I reviewed my study this year. From my own original situation, the gains are great. This is all the happiness brought to me by the motherland and Chairman Mao. But there are still many shortcomings in my study. I must, under the patient guidance of the teachers and the enthusiastic help of the students, improve my learning methods and make up for all the shortcomings.
    1954 is the second year of our country's first Five-Year Plan. I will redouble my efforts, overcome all difficulties, and strive for greater gains in cultural learning to greet this new year and the new victories of the motherland's construction. I am determined to guarantee: I must complete the study tasks assigned to me by the motherland and the Party.

    迎接新年一定完成学习任务
    中国人民大学附设工农速成中学学生  全国纺织工业劳动模范  郝建秀
    伟大的一九五四年新年来到了。
    过去这一年，我们伟大的祖国在毛主席的领导下，开始了第一个五年计划，胜利地走过了头一年，这是多么令人兴奋啊！
    我这一年都在学校学习。当我向祖国、向毛主席汇报学习情况的时候，不由得想起了过去没有文化的许多苦楚：工厂里行政上发个调查表，我看都看不懂，更没有方法填；别人要我介绍细纱工作经验，我很为难，我只会做，可介绍不出来；最急人的是到苏联去参观，在那里，每个地方都有很丰富很宝贵的经验，我是多么想用笔都记下来，把它传达给祖国人民啊！可是我只能用脑子记一点下来。就这样，我下了最大的决心要很好地学习文化。
    一年来的学习增加了我许多的知识：过去看报纸都不能看得很明白，现在我已经能读杜甫、白居易的诗，鲁迅先生的文章了；过去四分之二和二分之一的数值相等我都不懂，现在已经学到初中代数和几何了，过去只知道在机器车轴里放油和铜沙，却不知道为什么，现在从物理课里明白了它的道理；过去有很多纳闷的事，譬如不懂得为什么会刮风、下雨，为什么有春、夏、秋、冬，现在我全都懂得了；过去既不知道祖国的地方有这么辽阔广大，也不知道祖国的历史有这么悠久，现在所有这些都明白了，因此，也更深深感到我们祖国的伟大和可爱了。最近我们学习了总路线，对我们国家的前途看得更明白了，我们一定要在各方面努力，把我们祖国建设成一个富强的社会主义的国家。那时我们的祖国将会更加伟大，更加可爱呀！
    记得去年六月在中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会中，毛主席接见大会主席团时，曾亲切地指示我们要做到“身体好，学习好，工作好”。半年多来，我随时随地都牢记着毛主席的指示。我一面紧张地进行了学习，一面也坚持了身体锻炼，结果身体比过去更健康了。
      我在向祖国向毛主席汇报的时候，检查了自己这一年的学习，从我自己原有情况来说，收获是很大的，这都是祖国和毛主席给我带来的幸福。但我的学习上还存在许多缺陷，我一定要在老师的耐心教导和同学们的热情帮助下，好好改进自己的学习方法，把所有缺陷都补救起来。
    一九五四年是我们祖国实行第一个五年计划的第二年，我要加倍努力，克服一切困难，争取文化学习上的更大收获来迎接这新的一年，迎接祖国建设的新胜利。我有决心保证：一定要很好地完成祖国和党交给我的学习任务。
