　　A Careless Working Style Causes Huge Losses to the Country
    Reader Ji Shutai writes: The Luokou Shipping Brigade of the Shandong Yellow River Bureau conducts ship repair work every year during the winter off-season to prepare for transportation after the spring thaw. Because of the shortage of timber for shipbuilding in the area, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission reports to the Central Ministry of Water Conservancy, which in turn reports to the Central Financial and Economic Commission to allocate timber. The timber is sawn into planks near Jinan and then transported to the construction site. Last September, they prepared a table of the specifications, quality, and quantity of the timber according to the project material plan. Comrade Xin Yalin of the Enterprise Management Section of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission took it back to the office and reported it to the higher authorities for approval and allocation. In late November, with the date of material allocation approaching, they sent Comrade Sun Jiasheng to Kaifeng, with a letter of introduction from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to the Central Ministry of Water Conservancy, requesting the allocation of timber. However, upon inspection, the Ministry of Water Conservancy found that it had not received the application for the material allocation plan. It turned out that the application for the material allocation plan had been kept in Comrade Xin Yalin's drawer all along. Thus, they had to send people to the countryside to purchase a small amount of short timber to solve the sporadic repair projects on the one hand, and rush to create supplementary plans and vehicle transportation plans on the other. It is estimated that the timber applied for this time will not be transported to Jinan until January of this year at the earliest. After being sawn into planks and transported to the construction site, construction will not be possible until mid-February and completion until the end of April. Because the timber arrived late, not only did a large number of carpenters who had signed contracts have to stand idle, but it also affected the shipping brigade's transportation for more than fifty days after the spring thaw.
    This loss is huge! From this, we can see how much harm a careless working style can bring to the country.

### 漫不经心的工作作风给国家造成了巨大损失

　　漫不经心的工作作风给国家造成了巨大损失
    读者纪书台来信：山东黄河河务局洛口航运大队在每年冬季停航期间都要进行修船工作，为来年春暖后的运输作好准备。因为当地缺少修船木材，每年都是由黄河水利委员会呈报中央水利部转报中央财政经济委员会调拨木材，在济南附近锯解成板后再运到工地。去年九月，他们就按照工程用料计划，把木料的规格、质量、数目逐项制表，由黄河水利委员会企业管理科辛雅林同志带回机关，转报上级批拨。十一月下旬，距离拨料日子不远了，于是他们就派了孙家声同志到开封，由黄河水利委员会写信介绍到中央水利部请求调拨木材。可是水利部一检查，根本没有收到申请拨料计划。原来申请拨料计划一直被辛雅林同志压在抽屉里。这样，只好一方面在当地派人下乡采购一小部分短小木材解决零星修理工程，另一方面就星夜赶造追补计划和车运计划。估计这次申请的木料最快要今年一月才能运到济南，经过锯解成板运到工地，要到二月中旬才能施工、四月底才能竣工。因为木料到得迟，不但使大批订好合同的木工只能窝工，而且还影响了航运大队在春暖后五十多天的运输。
    这笔损失是巨大的！从这里我们可以看出：对工作漫不经心的作风为国家带来多大的危害。
