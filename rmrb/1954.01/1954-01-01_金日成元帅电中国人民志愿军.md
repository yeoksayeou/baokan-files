Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 31st: Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, sent a telegram to all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers on New Year's Eve, 1953, to congratulate them on the New Year.

The telegram said: "On the occasion of welcoming the New Year of 1954, on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and in my own name, I extend my heartfelt and warm congratulations and gratitude to you, who shed blood to aid our people in opposing the armed aggression of the American imperialist aggressors, the common enemy of the people of Korea and China, and the enemy of progressive mankind throughout the world."

The telegram continued: "In the past year, the heroic soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the soldiers of the Korean People's Army, with high heroism, shattered the armed aggression against our motherland by the American imperialist armed aggressors and their running dogs, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and victoriously concluded our just Fatherland Liberation War, making a great contribution to the great cause of safeguarding the freedom and independence of the Korean people and the peace of the Far East and the world. The great achievements you have made in the Korean War will be forever recorded in the annals of our motherland."

The telegram also said: "Today, American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang have not learned a lesson from their defeat in the Korean War, and are still doing everything possible to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and are plotting heinous acts of aggression. However, the Korean people, together with peace-loving people all over the world, resolutely demand a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. If American imperialism does not abandon its heinous aggressive conspiracy, then the adventurers will suffer even heavier blows."

The telegram concluded: "I wish all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the soldiers of the Korean People's Army, greater victories and achievements in the new year of 1954, in the common great cause of safeguarding the results of the Korean armistice, ensuring the post-war peaceful construction of the Korean people, and the peace and security of the Far East and the world."

    金日成元帅电中国人民志愿军
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅在一九五三年除夕致电中国人民志愿军全体将士祝贺新年。
    贺电说：值此迎接一九五四年新年之际，我以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会并以我个人的名义，向为了反对朝中两国人民的不共戴天的敌人、全世界进步人类的敌人——美帝国主义武装侵略者，而以鲜血援助了我国人民的你们，致以衷心的热烈的祝贺与感谢。
    贺电接着说：在过去一年中，英雄的中国人民志愿军将士与朝鲜人民军将士一起，以高度的英雄气概，粉碎了美帝国主义武装侵略者及其走狗李承晚匪帮对我们祖国的武装侵略，以伟大的胜利结束了我们正义的祖国解放战争，对维护朝鲜人民的自由与独立及远东与世界和平的伟大事业，作了伟大的贡献。你们在朝鲜战争中建立的伟大功勋，将永远记载在我们祖国的史册上。
    贺电又说：今天，美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮没有从它们在朝鲜战争中所遭到的失败得出教训，仍百般阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，并策划着凶恶的侵略行动。但是，朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民一起坚决要求和平解决朝鲜问题。如果美帝国主义不放弃其凶恶的侵略阴谋的话，那么，冒险者必将遭受更沉重的打击。
    贺电最后说：我预祝中国人民志愿军全体将士在一九五四年新的一年中，和朝鲜人民军将士一起，在维护朝鲜停战的成果，保证朝鲜人民的战后和平建设及远东与世界的和平与安全的共同伟大事业中，取得更大的胜利和成就。
