    Nationwide Plans Confirmed This Year to Develop Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations; Agricultural Cooperatives May Exceed 40,000

    [Report from this newspaper] Party committees across the country, grasping the principle of active leadership and steady progress, are intensifying their leadership in the work of developing agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

    Based on the demands of the masses and possible conditions, all parts of the country had already formulated preliminary plans for developing agricultural production cooperatives in 1954 around November of last year. Including the existing ones, the total number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide would develop to more than 35,800. Recently, according to reports from various regions, agricultural production cooperatives may possibly develop to around 45,000 this year. This is more than double the increase compared to 1953.

    According to current plans in various regions, every district in the old liberated areas can pilot agricultural production cooperatives, and some townships will also pilot them. In the new areas, with the exception of a very small number of counties that will not be piloted for the time being due to poor work foundations, the vast majority of counties can pilot one to three, and some regions, due to past experience in running cooperatives, can also pilot them at the district level.

    In 1954, organized peasant households will reach more than half of the total number of peasant households in each region. The Northeast region requires organized peasant households to reach 78% of the total number of peasant households, with peasant households participating in year-round mutual aid teams accounting for 40% of the number of organized peasant households (excluding the three major seasonal teams). The North China region requires organized peasant households to reach 70% of the total number of peasant households, with peasant households participating in year-round mutual aid teams accounting for 45% of the number of organized households. In addition, the Northeast and North China regions pay close attention to the balanced development of mutual aid organizations. For example, Hebei Province will focus on developing work in areas with weak mutual aid organizations. This year, the province requires organized peasant households to increase from the current 42% of the total number of households to 60%. In the newly liberated areas, plans are being made to greatly develop and improve various mutual aid teams. The Central South region plans to develop organized peasant households to 50% of the total number of rural households in 1954, with peasant households participating in year-round mutual aid teams accounting for 25% of the number of organized households. The Northwest region plans to organize 55% of peasant households this year, with those participating in year-round mutual aid teams accounting for 18% of the number of organized households. The East China region plans to organize 60% of peasant households this year, with those participating in year-round mutual aid teams accounting for 35% of the number of organized households. The Southwest region plans to organize 50% of peasant households this year, with those participating in year-round mutual aid teams accounting for 17% of the number of organized households.

    Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the work of developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations. After November 1953, the major regions and provinces, in conjunction with the study of the general line of the state during the transition period, successively held mutual aid and cooperation conferences to determine the plans and steps for development. Subsequently, responsible leading cadres above the district level in charge of running cooperatives were trained by province or prefecture (in the old liberated areas, counties with experience in running cooperatives were trained at the county level). The Henan Provincial Party Committee has trained more than 600 cadres for running cooperatives, and is training the backbone and mutual aid team leaders for establishing cooperatives at the county level. While training cadres, various regions are also carrying out full brewing of cooperative establishment and ideological education work among the masses in the villages that have been identified for establishing cooperatives. The cadre training work and the education work for the masses in various regions can be basically completed by the end of January; the work of establishing cooperatives can also be basically completed in February and March, according to the plans of various regions, and then quickly shifted to intense spring plowing production. In addition, in order to strengthen the leadership of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Party committees at all levels have determined that the secretaries of the prefectural committees, county committees, and district committees will personally deploy the work of developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and entrust deputy secretaries or stronger committee members to specifically lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    全国各地确定今年发展互助合作组织计划
    农业合作社可超过四万个
   【本报讯】全国各地党委掌握积极领导、稳步前进的方针，正加紧领导发展农业生产互助合作组织的工作。
    全国各地依据群众的要求和可能的条件，已在去年十一月间制出一九五四年发展农业生产合作社的初步计划，连同原有的在内，总计全国的农业生产合作社将发展到三万五千八百多个。最近，根据各地汇报材料，今年农业生产合作社已可能发展到四万五千个左右。这就比一九五三年可增加两倍多。
    根据各地区目前的计划，老解放区的每一个区都可以试办农业生产合作社，一部分乡也将试办；在新区，除极少数县因工作基础差，暂不试办外，绝大部分县可试办一个到三个，其中有一部分地区，由于以往办社已经有了经验，还可以在区一级试办。
    一九五四年组织起来的农户将达到各地区农户总数的一半以上。东北区要求组织起来的农户达到农户总数的百分之七十八，参加常年互助组的农户占组织起来农户数的百分之四十（不包括三大季组）；华北区要求组织起来的农户达到农户总数的百分之七十，参加常年互助组的农户占组织起来户数的百分之四十五。另外，东北、华北两区十分注意互助组织的平衡发展。如河北省，将着重在互助组织薄弱的地区进行发展工作，今年要求全省组织起来的农户，由现在占总户数的百分之四十二，增加到百分之六十。在新解放区，计划大量发展和提高各种互助组。中南区计划在一九五四年内，组织起来的农户发展到占农村总户数的百分之五十，参加常年互助组的农户占组织起来农户数的百分之二十五；西北区计划今年做到有百分之五十五的农户组织起来，其中参加常年互助组的占组织起来户数的百分之十八，华东区计划今年做到有百分之六十的农户组织起来，其中参加常年互助组的占组织起来农户的百分之三十五；西南区计划今年做到有百分之五十的农户组织起来，其中参加常年互助组的占组织起来农户的百分之十七。
    各地党委，都十分重视发展互助合作组织的工作。各大区、各省在一九五三年十一月以后，结合对国家在过渡时期总路线的学习，先后召开了互助合作会议，确定了发展的计划和步骤。接着，又以省或专区为单位，训练了区级以上的负责办社的主要干部（在老解放区，对办社有经验的县，则以县为单位进行训练）。河南省委已训练办社干部六百多人；并以县为单位训练建社的骨干和互助组长。各地在训练干部的同时，并在已确定要建社的乡村群众中，进行充分的建社酝酿和思想教育工作。各地的干部训练工作和对群众的教育工作，大体到一月底可基本结束；建社工作，依据各地计划，大体也可在二、三月份内全部结束，然后迅速地转入紧张的春耕生产。此外，各地党委为了加强对农业生产互助合作运动的领导，确定由地委、县委、区委书记亲自部署发展互助合作组织的工作，并委托副书记或较强的委员专门领导互助合作运动。
