    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 30th: Colonel Zhu Ran, Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, demanded at the secretaries' meeting today that the US side pay serious attention to the three incidents of US military aircraft intruding into the Military Armistice Commission headquarters area and the skies over Kaesong, violating the armistice agreement, and bear full responsibility for this provocative behavior. Colonel Zhu Ran pointed out: The incidents of US military aircraft violating the agreement are not only increasing, but recently they have blatantly intruded into the airspace above the headquarters of the Military Armistice Commission and the location of the Korean-Chinese delegation. This serious act of undermining the armistice agreement shows that the US side has not only failed to take any effective measures to restrain its military personnel, but is also clearly a deliberate act of provocation.
    At approximately 14:10 on December 23rd, four US military jet aircraft intruded from the south into the airspace above our 67 Height and other areas south of the Military Armistice Commission headquarters area, and then flew east. At approximately 16:50 on the same day, one US military jet aircraft intruded from the southeast into the airspace above Kaesong, the location of the Korean-Chinese delegation of the Military Armistice Commission, and the Korean-Chinese delegation's airport southwest of Kaesong, and then flew south. At approximately 13:50 on the 29th, two US military jet aircraft intruded from the southeast into the airspace above Panmunjom on our side via the airspace above Dongchang-ri, and then flew east over the Military Armistice Commission headquarters area.

    美机侵入军事停战委员会总部区
    我方斥美方违反协定
    【新华社开城三十日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面秘书长朱然上校今天在双方秘书长会议上，要求美方严重注意美方军用飞机三次侵入军事停战委员会总部区及开城上空的违反停战协定事件，并对这种挑衅行为担负全部责任。朱然上校指出：美方军用飞机违反协议的事件不但日益增多，而且最近竟公然侵入军事停战委员会总部所在地和朝中代表团所在地的上空。这种严重破坏停战协定的行为说明了美方不仅没有采取任何有效的措施约束其军事人员，而且显然是有意的挑衅行为。
    十二月二十三日十四时十分左右，美方军用喷气式飞机四架，从南方侵入军事停战委员会总部区所在地以南之我方六七高地等地上空后，向东飞去。同日十六时五十分左右，美方军用喷气式飞机一架，从东南方侵入军事停战委员会朝中代表团所在地——开城及开城西南朝中代表团飞机场等地上空，然后向南飞去。二十九日十三时五十分左右，美方军用喷气式飞机两架，从东南方经东场里上空侵入我方板门店上空，然后经军事停战委员会总部区上空向东飞去。
