Workers and Peasants Unite Closely to Build the Motherland

    —Workers from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory and Members of the Laiguangying Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Eastern Suburbs of Beijing Visit Each Other

    On January 13, 1954, peasants from various townships in the eastern suburbs of Beijing visited the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory. Workers enthusiastically explained the usage and work efficiency of the horse-drawn rocker-arm harvester to them.

    On January 12, 1954, workers from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory visited the Laiguangying Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. Cooperative members happily told the worker brothers: The old corn harvested by the cooperative yielded 90 jin per mu more in 1953 than in 1952.

    The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory frequently receives letters from farmers in various places requesting improvements to agricultural tools. This is a scene of the factory's engineers and technicians studying how to improve the plow bolts of the No. 25 plow based on farmers' opinions.

    The workers brought many instruction manuals for new agricultural tools to the Laiguangying Township Agricultural Production Cooperative. They explained the usage and work efficiency to the cooperative members one by one.

    Technicians explained the usage of the three-pronged lightweight weeder to the farmers and listened to farmers' suggestions for improvement.

    Old farmer Chen Fucheng warmly received the worker brothers and told them about the bumper harvest of last year.

    The worker brothers visited the densely planted wheat fields of the Laiguangying Township Agricultural Production Cooperative.

    Wu Yushu (right), the vice-chairman of the Laiguangying Township Agricultural Production Cooperative, and Li Yuzhen (left), a worker from the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, established a close friendship. They encouraged each other to work hard on different production fronts to build a socialist country!

    The farmers visited the screw section of the forging workshop with great interest.

    The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory produces a large number of various new-style animal-powered agricultural tools to meet the needs of farmers in Hebei, Henan, Suiyuan, Songjiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other provinces, enabling farmers to upgrade from using old-style agricultural tools to using new-style animal-powered agricultural tools, laying a good foundation for the further mechanization of agricultural production in the future. This is a large batch of new-style agricultural tools ready to be loaded and transported.

    A large number of agricultural tools produced by the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory are resold to farmers in various places through supply and marketing cooperatives. The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Agricultural Tool and Pesticide Supply Station is sorting out agricultural tools in preparation for supplying farmers' needs for spring plowing.
