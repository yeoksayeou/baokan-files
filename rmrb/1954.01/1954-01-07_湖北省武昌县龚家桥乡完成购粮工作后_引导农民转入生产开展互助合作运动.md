After completing the grain purchase work, Gongjiaqiao Township, Wuchang County, Hubei Province, convened a township people's representative conference to further publicize the general line of the state during the transition period, reverse the relaxed mentality of village cadres and farmers, and guide farmers throughout the township to shift to production and actively carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

From mid-November to mid-December last year, Gongjiaqiao Township, in conjunction with the grain purchase work, publicized the general line of the state during the transition period to farmers throughout the township, enhancing their patriotism and socialist consciousness. Farmers throughout the township enthusiastically sold more than 430,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

After the completion of the grain purchase work, village cadres and farmers in the township, due to their insufficient understanding of the general line, developed a relaxed mentality. Many people thought, "We have studied the general line, sold the surplus grain, and there is nothing else to do." Some farmers even wasted the money they got from selling grain instead of using it to expand production.

In light of this situation, the township work team and the CCP township branch convened a township people's representative conference on December 19th last year to further publicize and implement the general line, guide farmers throughout the township to actively carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and further expand production. At the meeting, the issue of why the small-scale peasant economy must undergo socialist transformation was emphatically discussed, and the difficulties of the small-scale peasant economy and the benefits of organizing were specifically analyzed.

During the discussion, the representatives unanimously agreed that the small-scale peasant economy has three shortcomings: (1) It cannot withstand natural disasters; (2) Illness and death, and loss of labor, can destroy a farming family at any time; (3) Each household is a production unit, unable to carry out large-scale machine production, with scattered operations, great waste, and low output. The representatives all believed that before liberation, farmers were exploited by landlords and rich peasants. After liberation, through land reform, although farmers were allocated land, they still could not escape poverty if they did not carry out socialist transformation, and their lives would still be unstable. For example, the grain harvested by middle peasant Huang Zujing's family was originally enough to eat, but last year, because one person suffered a serious illness, they sold grain to buy medicine, resulting in the whole family lacking more than a month's worth of food and having to borrow grain from others. Many representatives, when recalling the changes in their lives since liberation, also said: "Our current lives are hundreds of times better than before liberation; but they are hundreds of times worse than those of Soviet farmers." After discussion, the representatives unanimously realized that only by organizing and following the path of Soviet farmers can they forever escape poverty and suffering and live a happier life.

When discussing the benefits of organizing, many representatives used their own experiences to illustrate the superiority of organizing. Representative Zeng Zhaoheng compared the advantages of mutual aid teams and the difficulties of individual households during last year's autumn harvest: First, when it rained during the rice harvest, the mutual aid team had more people and harvested quickly, suffering no losses; many individual households got up in the middle of the night and harvested until dark, exhausting themselves, but still could not keep up, and the rice sprouted in the fields. Second, the mutual aid team finished harvesting in eight days, while the fastest individual households took ten days; the mutual aid team also had time to help individual households harvest, earning wages, and some individual households could not hire anyone even if they offered money during busy times. The production situation of the mutual aid teams in Gongjiaqiao Township also showed that because the mutual aid teams can solve difficulties, "seize the opportunity," and cultivate deeply and meticulously, they can harvest more grain. For example, the Lin Baoqing mutual aid team averaged more than 600 jin of rice per mu last year, while individual households generally could only produce more than 400 jin per mu.

After the meeting, the representatives actively continued to publicize the general line to the masses, promoting winter production and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Two new mutual aid teams have been organized in Tangjiawan, and fertilizer accumulation work has begun. Farmer Zeng Chuyuan, who has strong labor power and used to say "I will work individually to the end and never cooperate," now also asks to join the mutual aid team and mobilizes others to organize. Several farmers who had withdrawn from mutual aid teams also requested to return to the teams. The Lin Baoqing, Wang Shilin, and other mutual aid teams, on the one hand, are expanding the mutual aid teams and preparing to establish agricultural production cooperatives, and on the other hand, are taking the lead in and mobilizing the masses to carry out fertilizer accumulation work.

    湖北省武昌县龚家桥乡完成购粮工作后
    引导农民转入生产开展互助合作运动
    湖北省武昌县龚家桥乡结束购粮工作后，召开全乡人民代表会议，进一步宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线，扭转了乡村干部和农民群众的松气思想，引导全乡农民转入生产，积极开展互助合作运动。
    龚家桥乡在去年十一月中旬到十二月中旬，配合购粮工作向全乡农民宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线，提高了农民的爱国主义和社会主义觉悟。全乡农民踊跃卖给国家四十三万斤余粮。
    在购粮工作完成后，该乡乡村干部和农民群众由于对总路线了解得还不深刻，产生了松气思想。许多人认为：“总路线学习了，余粮卖了，没有什么事了。”有的农民甚至不把卖粮得到的款用来扩大生产，而是浪费掉了。
    根据这一情况，该乡工作组和中共乡支部在去年十二月十九日召开了全乡人民代表会议，进一步宣传和贯彻了总路线，引导全乡农民积极开展互助合作运动，进一步扩大生产。会上，着重讨论了小农经济为什么必须进行社会主义改造的问题，具体地分析了小农经济的困难和组织起来的好处。
    代表们在讨论中一致认为，小农经济有三个缺点：（一）经不起自然灾害；（二）疾病死亡，劳动力丧失，随时可以毁灭一个农家；（三）一家一户一个生产单位，不能进行大规模的机器生产，分散经营，浪费大，产量低。代表们都认为，解放前农民受地主、富农的剥削，解放后经过土地改革，农民虽然分到了田地，但是如果不进行社会主义改造，仍然不能摆脱贫困，生活仍然是不稳定的。例如中农黄祖敬家打的粮食本来够吃，去年因为一个人害了大病，卖粮吃药，结果全家就缺了一个多月的口粮，只得向别人借粮吃。许多代表在回忆解放以来的生活变化时还说：“我们现在的生活，比起解放前要好几百倍；比起苏联农民来，却要差几百倍。”经过讨论，代表们一致认识到只有组织起来，走苏联农民的道路，才能永远摆脱穷困和痛苦，过更幸福的生活。
    在讨论组织起来的好处的时候，许多代表用自己的切身体验说明组织起来的优越性。代表曾昭珩把去年秋收时互助组的优点和单干户的困难作了个对比：第一，割谷时下雨，互助组人多割得快，没有受到一点损失；许多单干户半夜起来，割到天黑，人累得了不得，还是割不赢，谷子在田里生了芽。第二，互助组八天割完了谷，单干户最快的割了十天；互助组还有时间帮助单干户割谷，得到了工资，有的单干户忙时拿钱也请不到人。龚家桥乡互助组的生产情况也说明了，互助组由于能够解决困难，能“抢火色”，深耕细作，所以能多打粮食。例如林宝卿互助组去年平均每亩田产稻谷六百多斤，单干户每亩田一般只能产四百多斤。
    会后，代表们积极向群众继续宣传总路线，推动了冬季生产和互助合作运动的开展。唐家湾已新组织起两个互助组，并展开积肥工作。农民曾楚原劳动力强，过去说“单干到底，永不互助”，现在也要求参加互助组，并动员别人组织起来。有几个退出互助组的农民，也要求归组。林宝卿、汪士林等互助组，一面扩大互助组，酝酿成立农业生产合作社，一面带头和动员群众开展积肥工作。
