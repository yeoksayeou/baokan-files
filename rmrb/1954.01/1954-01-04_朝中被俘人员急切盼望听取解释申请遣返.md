Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 3rd: The 128 Chinese People’s Volunteer Army prisoners of war (POWs) who were repatriated last New Year's Eve said that the Korean and Chinese POWs in the Dongchang-ri POW camp are anxiously waiting to hear the explanations so that they can exercise their right to be repatriated. These POWs, deprived of their right to hear explanations and apply for repatriation, are extremely anxious and worried all day long. Many are so anxious that they cannot eat or sleep well. Many look longingly to the north at the flickering lights of Panmunjom at night, hoping to escape from this sea of ​​misery.

The PVA returnees said that Kuomintang (KMT) special agents are spreading a large number of rumors in the camp to deceive the POWs, saying: "Now, the Indian Custodial Forces only 'custody' and do not 'repatriate'. If anyone escapes the barbed wire, the Indians will still send him back to the original camp after catching him." They also said, "The Communist reception personnel in Panmunjom have all withdrawn. Even if you escape the barbed wire, no one will take you in, and you will have to go to Taiwan with us." These special agents even openly said to the POWs: "The warships and planes are ready. As long as they give the 'order,' we will take you out of the barbed wire."

At the same time, the KMT special agents' reign of terror over the POWs is becoming more and more rampant. The returnees said that recently, the special agents in Camp No. 9 severely beat more than a dozen POWs who expressed their desire to return home with tent poles, baseball bats, and whips. The special agents deliberately beat their legs and buttocks so that they could not move. The special agents said as they beat them: "Break your legs and see how you can escape from the camp!" Many POWs were beaten so badly that they could not walk for several days. The special agents often beat the POWs in the middle of the night and threatened them with American-made steel knives. Sometimes, the special agents forced the entire company of POWs to watch the torture and openly threatened them, saying, "This is what happens to those who want to return home. Anyone who dares to return home will end up like this!" One POW said, "I once ate five buns in one meal during the New Year," and the special agents thought he had a desire to return home and beat him severely all night. Another POW wanted to escape from the camp, but was caught and dragged back by the special agents as soon as he ran to the gate. That night, the special agents beat him half the night with a baseball bat and clamped his calves with two poles. These two POWs are still suffering in the clutches of the special agents.

The returnees said that the KMT special agents forced the POWs to assemble fourteen times a day, standing in the bitter cold to listen to the "instructions" of the special agent leaders. The special agents also forced the POWs to conduct military drills and practice hitting sandbags, so that they could drive the POWs out of the camp when the time came. Since December 24, the special agents have forced the POWs to conduct six "demonstrations," each lasting more than an hour, three of which were conducted at night, and the POWs, wearing thin and tattered clothes, were shivering with cold. The special agents also did not allow the sick to leave the camp to see a doctor, in order to prevent them from taking the opportunity to escape from the camp and demand repatriation. In Camp No. 5, seriously ill POWs could only go to the hospital to see a doctor under the supervision of the "battalion commander," "CIE Education Section Chief," or "garrison captain."

The 128 returnees unanimously requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to impartially implement the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," to make up for the ninety days of explanation time, so that their partners who are now in dire straits have the opportunity to request repatriation and return to the embrace of the motherland.

    朝中被俘人员急切盼望听取解释申请遣返
    【新华社开城三日电】去年除夕遣返归来的一百二十八名志愿军被俘人员说，东场里战俘营内朝中被俘人员正焦急地等待着听取解释，以便行使其被遣返的权利。这些被剥夺了听取解释和申请遣返权利的战俘们整天焦灼不安，忧虑异常。许多人焦急得吃不下饭，睡不好觉。许多人在夜间留恋地向北眺望板门店的闪闪灯光，盼望能逃出苦海。
    志愿军归来人员说：国民党特务正在营场中散播大量谣言，欺骗战俘们说：“现在，印度看管部队只管‘看管’，不管‘遣返’了，谁要是逃出铁丝网，印度人抓住后还是要把他送回到原来营场的。”他们还说，“现在板门店的共方接收人员都已经撤走了，即使你们逃出铁丝网，也没有人收留，还得跟着我们到台湾去。”这些特务分子还公然对战俘们说：“军舰和飞机已经准备好了。只要他们一声‘命令’，我们就带你们冲出铁丝网去。”
    与此同时，国民党特务对战俘的恐怖统治越来越猖狂了。归来人员说，最近，第九号营场的特务用帐篷杆子、垒球棒子和皮鞭等对十几个流露出回国愿望的战俘施行毒打。特务故意毒打他们的腿部和臀部使得他们不能行动。特务们一边打一边说：
  “打断你的腿，看你还用什么逃出营场去？”许多战俘被打得好几天不能走路。特务们时常在深夜里毒打战俘，并且用美国制的钢刀威胁他们。有时，特务分子还强迫全中队的战俘去观看拷打，并且公开威胁他们说“这是想回国的人，谁要是敢回国，就和这个人一样！”有一个战俘，说了一句“我从前过年时，有一次一顿吃过五个包子”，特务们就认为他有回国思想，把他狠狠地打了一夜。另外一个战俘想逃出营场，但是刚跑到门口，就被特务抓了回去。当天晚上特务就用垒球棒打了他半夜，又用两根杠子夹他的腿肚。这两个战俘至今仍在特务的魔掌中受着折磨。
    归来人员说：国民党特务每天强迫战俘集合十四次，站在寒风凛冽中听特务头子的“训话”。特务们还强迫战俘进行军事操练，练习打被包，以便到时赶战俘冲出营场。从十二月二十四日起，特务已强迫战俘进行了六次“示威游行”，每次一个多小时，其中有三次是在夜间进行的，穿着单薄破烂衣服的战俘都冻得混身发抖。特务们还不准有病的人出营场去看病，以防止他们乘机逃出营场要求遣返。在第五号营场里，重病的战俘只有在“大队长”、“CIE教育股长”或“警备队长”的监视之下才能到医院去看病。
    一百二十八名归来人员一致要求中立国遣返委员会公正执行“职权范围”的规定，补足九十天的解释时间，使那些现在正处在水深火热之中的伙伴们，有机会要求遣返，重返祖国怀抱。
