Cannot Walk That Road
Li Zhun

Editor's Note: The short story "Cannot Walk That Road" was originally published in the "Henan Daily" on November 20th of last year. This story truthfully and vividly depicts several different peasant characters, demonstrating the victory of socialist thought over the spontaneous tendencies of peasants in rural areas. It is one of the better short stories depicting rural life in recent years.

I

These days, everyone is talking about Zhang Shuan selling his land.

The old saying is true, "To become poor, be a 'turning caterpillar'." Zhang Shuan's life was originally manageable; his family of four cultivated more than ten mu of land. If he didn't recklessly deal with livestock, and cultivated the land well, there would be enough grain to eat. But he insisted on carrying a whip and twirling a cow tooth rope. This spring, he traded a red heifer for a small donkey, which couldn't do work when he got it back. He sold it again before he had fed it for ten days. It turned out that he lost more than 200,000 yuan. He wanted to buy another calf, but couldn't afford it. At this time, the township cadre said to him, "Zhang Shuan, don't mess around! 'Turning clumsiness into skill will only make a big vest out of a gown'." But he refused to listen. He borrowed one million yuan from his wife's sister's husband and rushed back two old oxen from Zhoujiakou. As soon as he got home, he ran into a frost disaster before the wheat harvest, and the cattle couldn't be sold for a good price. He borrowed grass and fodder to feed them until it was time to plow the dry land, and with great difficulty, he managed to sell them, but he lost the equivalent of a donkey's price, and owed his wife's sister's husband several hundred thousand yuan.

"Falling into a hole and carrying a debt is like a Yellow Balm plaster stuck to the body." Zhang Shuan was a small farmer who couldn't withstand these setbacks. He couldn't figure out a way to get through this no matter how he planned day and night. His wife's sister's husband came to demand payment every day, causing friction between the close relatives, and he didn't want to say soft words anymore, so he hardened his heart: "Sell the land! Sell the 'One Flag' plot, sell the good land, and see if anyone wants it!"

This "One Flag" plot was originally a good piece of land in the village, in the shape of a triangle, close to the flowing ditch. It yielded two crops a year, and everyone envied it. It was a famous "grain storage" in the village. Zhang Shuan gritted his teeth to sell this piece of land, firstly because it was easy to sell, and secondly because he calculated that this two mu of land could sell for more than one million yuan, leaving him some money to try another venture. Because not only could he not cultivate the land well, but he also felt that farming was never satisfying.

As soon as Zhang Shuan's land sale was mentioned, the villagers began to speculate. Some guessed this family, some guessed that family, but no one could be sure. Because some families had been more active after liberation, but that didn't necessarily mean they would buy land. Although there were two middle-peasant families who could afford it, they pretended to be poor all day long, and it was unlikely that they would move this large sum of money. Finally, they guessed it might be Song Laoding. Everyone knew that he had turned around in the past two years, and his second son, Donglin, was a carpenter who sent back tens of thousands of yuan every month. Laoding had also been clamoring to acquire a few mu of property for a long time, but some people still didn't believe it, because his eldest son, Dongshan, was a Communist Party member.

II

"People's eyes are scales," this saying is absolutely correct. Song Laoding received eight registered letters from Donglin this year, each containing money. This really worried him. He had never worn a pair of foreign socks in his life, but he couldn't bear to buy them. He just saved the money over and over again. Dongshan bought bean cakes this spring and asked him for money once, but he didn't give it. Another time, the mutual aid group was preparing to dig a well in the lower-lying area, and Dongshan asked him for money again. He said, "I have a use for this money, you'll know later." Dongshan was a tough guy, and he didn't want to take this money from his father. But recently, he realized that his father wanted to buy land.

As soon as Song Laoding heard that Zhang Shuan was selling the "One Flag" land, he felt as anxious and happy as he had when the bridal sedan chair arrived at the door when he got married, but he couldn't say anything to anyone. These days, he was running around inquiring. At breakfast, he solemnly called Dongshan into the house and asked with interest, "What's the situation with Zhang Shuan selling the land these days?" Dongshan simply replied, "He's not planning to sell it."

Laoding was silent for a long time, and Dongshan went out with his bowl of rice.

At night, Dongshan came back very late and saw his father smoking his pipe, puffing away non-stop. His mother was dozing on the side.

When Laoding saw him come back, he asked, "Someone from the district was looking for you, did you see him?"

"I saw him," Dongshan said, wanting to say more, but he hadn't figured out how to say it. Laoding was specifically waiting for him to discuss buying the land. He thought that Dongshan had a bit of a temper, and that young people needed to be coaxed slowly.

The room was so quiet that it felt like no one was there. Laoding spoke first, cautiously saying, "I saw Wang Laosan today, he said Zhang Shuan swore he would sell this land. I checked out the 'One Flag' plot, it's black loam. As long as there's a heavy rain, it's more effective than applying manure." He paused, took another puff of his cigarette and said, "I thought about why it wasn't divided to us when the land reform divided it to Zhang Shuan. But we're cadres, of course we can't compete with him for this land. Now, if he sells it, we can't miss this opportunity!" He stared at Dongshan's face and said, "What's precious for a farmer? It's still having a few mu of land!" Dongshan knew he was going to say these things and was ready to answer, but Laoding sighed and said, "What do I need money for? Isn't it all for you brothers? Can I be with you forever?" Dongshan smiled and said, "Zhang Shuan isn't selling that land anymore, don't listen to Wang Laosan's nonsense."

"He's not selling!" Laoding laughed, "I'm afraid he doesn't have anyone to pay off his debt!" "He doesn't have much debt," Dongshan continued, perking up, "I discussed it with him this afternoon. Selling land is not the solution. Zhang Shuan doesn't have thirty or fifty mu of land, just that dozen mu, what will he do if he sells it! We and Zhang Shuan's family were poor peasants before. Now that he's in trouble, we have to help him. We can't buy his land!" The old man was impatient, he had heard rumors from others saying, "Dongshan is a party member, he won't buy land to collect interest." He thought that his son probably didn't dare to buy it because of this, so he said angrily, "Why can't we buy it? Only others can buy it! Buying and selling land is like Zhou Yu hitting Huang Gai, one is willing to hit, one is willing to be hit, both are willing, it's not like a party member is extorting him, why can't he buy it!" Dongshan was caught off guard that his father would say such a thing, and said urgently, "Dad! It's not like that! It's true that Zhang Shuan is selling land, but he doesn't have to sell it, he just needs to borrow several hundred thousand yuan. We can't watch him go bankrupt. I've already promised to lend him 500,000 yuan..." Laoding interrupted him before he finished:

"When did you promise him?" He rolled his bloodshot eyes.

"This afternoon I promised him." Before Dongshan's words landed, Laoding suddenly stood up. His face was red, and the veins on his neck were bulging. He shouted like a madman, "This is Donglin's money, not yours, you lend it! You lend it! Why didn't you lend me to him, why didn't you lend your mother to him!"

The old man was so angry that he threw on his clothes and went out. Dongshan's mother was also awakened. She complained, "Your sister has good news, I've asked him for money several hundred times, wanting to buy something, but he wouldn't give it to me. He's just thinking about buying land, why are you arguing with him about it!"

III

The father and son's argument didn't matter, but it panicked Dongshan's wife, Xiulan. She first ran to the threshing ground to persuade her father-in-law to go back. The old man said coldly, "I'm not going back, I want to sit for a while!" Then he slowly instructed, "Don't set off firecrackers, don't let anyone know about it."

Xiulan hurried back home, Dongshan was lying in bed sighing deeply.

"Are you angry?" She smiled and sat on the edge of the bed.

"I don't have anything to be angry about!" Dongshan pretended to be calm. Xiulan then complained, "You don't know what's on our dad's mind, he's already made his calculations. If he wants to buy land for the second son, let him buy it, why do you care what he does!" Dongshan, upon hearing this, suddenly sat up and said, "Why are you saying this too! It's not about whether we buy it or another family buys it, the problem is we can't watch Zhang Shuan sell all his land, how will he live in the future! When we encounter this kind of thing, we have to find a solution. A Communist Party member isn't just someone with a title!" Then he slowly said, "I know myself that I haven't fulfilled my responsibility. Before the wheat harvest, when I passed by Zhang Shuan's land, seeing the wheat growing like incense in his field, I felt uncomfortable. We are all poor peasants, knowing that he's not used to growing crops, and I didn't go to help him. Every time people passed by his field, they said: 'Looking at this field of wheat, it won't even cover the cost of the seeds!' I felt like I was being slapped in the face. Like you said, I should just take care of myself." He saw Xiulan's mouth pouting like a water chestnut, and poked her forehead with his finger, saying, "You're a Communist Youth League member, for goodness' sake!"

"Don't touch me!" Xiulan pushed his hand away and said, "I'm asking you, you're showing off in front of me, why didn't you say this in front of our dad! Since you can say these things, why didn't you say them in front of our dad?" Dongshan laughed and said, "I didn't finish speaking before he left, what could I do!" Xiulan deliberately kept a straight face and said, "I also have to criticize you. Usually, you don't even say a word to him, father and son don't sit together and talk. As soon as you pick up your bowl of rice, you go to the street. As soon as you put on your clothes, you go to the township government. You be your party member, he be his farmer. When something happens, you want him to do things according to your words, of course he'll argue with you!" She said, pouting her mouth. Dongshan laughed and said, "You're giving me a lesson." But he was quite convinced in his heart. Xiulan was just about to continue speaking when suddenly the sound of Laoding's "thump, thump" footsteps sounded in the yard. Dongshan quickly waved his hand, and Xiulan stopped talking. After the old man went into the room, Dongshan listened quietly to the movements in the main room. He didn't hear clearly what his mother said, but then the old man raised his voice and said, "He can lend money if he wants to, as long as he has money! He can even lend someone a fortune!" Xiulan pushed Dongshan and laughed, saying, "He's telling you to listen!"

IV

As the sun was just revealing its bright red face, the village morning was quiet, and faint sounds of herding cattle were bustling in the fields.

Song Laoding didn't go to the field. He hadn't slept well all night, tossing and turning, constantly thinking about the land-buying matter. As soon as he got up at dawn, he went to Wang Laosan's house.

Wang Laosan had worked as an accountant for landlords before liberation. In the past, he ran around the village and was considered a "middleman". In recent years, the villagers hadn't paid much attention to him, but he was very good at currying favor with people. When he saw old men and women, he would "tell them their fortune"; when he saw cadres, he would try his best to say progressive words. In the past, when he saw Song Laoding, he wouldn't even glance at him; now that he saw that the masses in the village supported Dongshan quite a bit, he treated Laoding with extra warmth. Song Laoding had discussed the land-buying matter with him, and he was running around like a shuttle.

As soon as Laoding crossed his doorstep, he greeted him and said, "Oh! Old brother, I was planning to find you yesterday, there's progress on the Zhang Shuan matter."

"I heard he doesn't want to sell it?" Laoding asked slowly.

"It doesn't matter if he delays it for two days, I'm here anyway. He wants to borrow some money and not sell the land. I said: 'Aren't you stupid, you should sell it when you have to, don't get sick with that foreign disease, you still have to pay back the debt if you borrow money!' He's a little bit alive to the idea again, don't worry!" He said, leaning close to Laoding's ear: "It's guaranteed to be sold to you, this land is cheap, next year's wheat season will earn back more than half of your capital." Laoding hated Wang Laosan's winking and gesturing way of speaking. He said, "We won't force him to sell it if he really doesn't want to." Wang Laosan then patted him on the shoulder and said, "Old brother, this opportunity doesn't come often, you can't miss it! Sigh, you, you have twenty mu of land now, if you buy another ten mu, you can afford to hire a long-term worker, just hire a long-term worker." Then he said with a forced smile: "You've worked hard your whole life, it's time to rest." Laoding listened to him and didn't say anything for a long time, his head drooping. His brain was buzzing. He was thinking: "Am I really going to hire a long-term worker? I'm the one who carried a long-term worker for eighteen years!" He walked out of Wang Laosan's door and remembered that Wang Laosan used to have the same energy when he was buying land for the landlords. He also remembered that when he was working for the Zhu family, the shopkeepers watched others working hard under the big wheat sky, and Wang Laosan was also standing on the side fanning himself. He spat hard and said, "Go to hell, Wang Laosan, you're just a floater!"

He paced step by step to the threshing ground. A row of wheat straw stacks appeared before his eyes. He looked at this one, compared it with that one, and thought, "As long as I buy Zhang Shuan's few mu of land, hum, next year's wheat season will show whose wheat straw stack is bigger." He watched his own wheat straw stack slowly growing bigger, as if a group of long-term workers were working on his field... He then saw Zhang Shuan's wheat stack slowly shrinking, so small that it was like a grass basket. He suddenly thought of Zhang Shuan's children, the group of children in front of him, all skinny and skin-and-bones, running towards him. He quickly tiptoed back home.

Xiulan and her mother-in-law were making pancakes in the kitchen, chatting lively. Laoding heard his daughter-in-law say, "My dad! He still has an old-fashioned mind..." and quickly stood in the yard, cocking his head to listen.

"Isn't he doing it for you? He's already halfway into the ground, isn't he planning for you? The number of people increases year by year, how can he not plan for you!" The wife said. Xiulan laughed and said, "We won't let him plan for us. Now we're in a mutual aid group, and if our village establishes a cooperative next year, we'll join the cooperative. In the future, we'll be able to use machines to cultivate the land, and we won't have to worry about not having enough grain to eat!" Laoding listened and was so angry that his beard stood up. He was thinking that he had encountered a stubborn son and another odd daughter-in-law.

At mealtime, Xiulan served the food. Laoding turned his face to the side and didn't even look at it. Xiulan said, "Dad! It's getting cold, eat." He acted like he didn't hear. After a while, he suddenly said to Dongshan's mother, "I'm not eating, I'm going to the market to eat meat!" He said, grabbing a few steamed buns, and said angrily, "Who am I saving for? I've broken all the reins, and I still can't get a good reputation!" He glared at Xiulan, who was facing the wall, secretly laughing.

Laoding did go to the market for a meal. But he didn't eat meat, he just ate a bowl of tofu soup with steamed buns.

V

There was something special about Laoding and Dongshan's arguments, which was that the angrier they were, the more they avoided working together. Even if one person was planting and the other was helping with the planter, they wouldn't answer a single word to each other all day, but neither of them would hide under the covers and sleep.

In the spring, because Laoding was unwilling to lend his cart to others, Dongshan promised it to them. The two argued over this matter and didn't speak for a full ten days. This time, Laoding thought that they wouldn't speak for at least half a month.

As it was getting dark, Dongshan came back from the Party branch meeting, and Laoding was feeding the cow. He pretended not to see him while adding grass. Unexpectedly, Dongshan asked, "Dad! After we harvest the millet, should we plant peas in that field?" Laoding was caught off guard that his son would ask him this. He looked at Dongshan's face, which had a smile on it, although it wasn't a natural smile. He knew that his son had come to reconcile. So he slowly said, "Okay, that field needs to be rotated." Saying that, he sat down on the stone for pounding cloth in the yard. He thought that his son was probably willing to buy the land, so he cautiously said, "You're still young! It's nothing to have a few mu of land! Land is the foundation, I can't buy ten or eight mu for you brothers while I'm alive, I always feel bad about it. What are you afraid of? I'll take the lead in buying it, who would dare to say anything. We can't just eat fancy steamed buns, we have to plan to eat plain steamed buns too. Hum! I dare say that we'll add six mu of dry wheat every year," he waved his hand when he said this, "and we'll never be able to finish eating the wheat."

"We have enough grain to eat now!" Dongshan squatted on the ground and said.

"That's right! We have it, but it's always tight."

Dongshan thought that his father was still so stubborn. So he changed the subject to crops. He smiled and said, "How much do you think we can harvest from those four mu of millet in the east field this year?" Laoding thought about it for a long time and said, "We can harvest at least thirteen or fourteen hundred catties." Dongshan knew that his father always got jealous when he heard that other people's crops were good. So he said, "The millet in Lin Wang's field can harvest one big stone per mu this year. The nineteen mu of millet in their group is better than ours, taller by a chopstick." Laoding always got upset when he heard these words. He hummed and said, "As long as you're willing to put stuff in the ground, no one's land is 'vegetarian'." Dongshan quickly said, "That's right, but we didn't put anything in. If we use 100,000 or 200,000 yuan to buy some fine fertilizer to put in the ground this spring, we'll harvest more than three or five hundred catties." Laoding spoke for a long time, but Dongshan revealed the thing about the spring. So he changed the subject and said, "It's not just about putting manure in the ground, you have to look at the soil quality. That millet field of Lin Wang's used to be ours, how could I not know, it's all black loam, it's good for raising seedlings." Dongshan was afraid that he wouldn't say this. When he heard him say this, he said, "How did we sell that land to He Laoda?" He said with a reproachful tone. Laoding looked at his son's face, sighed, and said, "You don't have to blame your dad, I shudder all over when I bring up this matter. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, we didn't harvest anything for two seasons, and your mother happened to have postpartum illness. I had just been fired by the Zhu family, and had to sell coal every day to earn some money to pay for your mother's medicine. You were still young at that time, and how your little sister suffered, your mother was lying in bed, and I had to hold her every day and go door to door to find milk, I wanted to ask your grandma to come, but we didn't have any grain at home; I had to cook, take care of the patient, and get up before dawn to sell coal, as a result, your little sister starved to death." Laoding said this, and his eyes turned red. He paused, bit his teeth, and said: "After your mother recovered from her illness, we had a ton of debts to repay, eating five liters of grain from the landlord during the wheat harvest period, and having to pay back one dou after the harvest. Selling four mu of land to He Laoda, I don't know how much money we made from that, it was only enough to pay for medicine. ” He then drooped his head and said, "It was that year that I sent you to learn coppersmithing, you were only thirteen years old!" He secretly looked at Dongshan's face that had suffered since he was a child.

"Didn't anyone help us back then?" Dongshan asked.

"Relief! The township office almost wanted to grind the bones of the poor into buttons, the rich people were only afraid that you wouldn't be poor enough!" He said, gritting his teeth, and then said: "Not like now..." He suddenly stopped there. Dongshan saw through his father's thoughts, sighed, and slowly said: "Zhang Shuan's family situation now is similar to ours back then." He thought for a while and said: "If we had those difficulties now, we wouldn't be able to sell the land. Now, the Communist Party's leadership is like this, as long as you work honestly and put in the effort, the government and everyone can help you when you encounter something, they want everyone to improve slowly, they can't watch one family go bankrupt."

Laoding didn't say anything, he just felt the veins on his forehead throbbing and jumping, his mind surging like the Yellow River.

Dongshan looked at his father's appearance, then slowly said: "Dad! In the past, the landlords only hated the poor for not being poor enough, now everyone helps each other, you've suffered that bitterness, you know what it tastes like, we can't take the road that the landlords took." Laoding still didn't say anything, he only felt like something was ringing in his mind.

In the evening, Laoding went to bed early. Dongshan and Xiulan were squeezed into Dad's room, chatting with his mother. They were calculating how much grain, corn, and sweet potatoes they could harvest this year. While they were calculating, the old woman squinted her eyes, her mouth unable to close.

Xiulan smiled and said: "Next year, we'll plant yellow millet, let's put in the effort, I guarantee we can harvest five or six hundred catties per mu!" Dongshan's mother said: "Don't talk nonsense, how can anyone harvest five or six hundred catties per mu?" Dongshan quickly followed up and said: "Yes, Mom, we visited the county farm, that millet can harvest that much, and in the future, when we use machines to plant the land, we'll harvest even more." Xiulan grabbed the words and said: "Mom, Mom, don't you remember? The film team from the province showed the movie 'Happy Life', how good the large fields of wheat grew, everyone was envious, there were harvesters for harvesting wheat, and threshing machines in the field; don't you remember that after harvesting the wheat, the plowing machine plowed so wide at once!" Dongshan's mother couldn't close her mouth when she heard her daughter-in-law mention this movie and said, "That's true, watching people planting and harvesting with machines; there was a table full of dishes when they ate, and the clothes they wore were bright, how comfortable their lives were." "That's why it's called a happy life! Mom, we're in a mutual aid group now, if the conditions are good, we'll establish an agricultural production cooperative, and then slowly develop it. When we establish a collective farm in the future, we'll also live that kind of happy life!..." Xiulan wanted to continue talking, but Dongshan interrupted her and said: "A happy life is always coming, but you have to take the right road, otherwise, some farmers who have turned themselves around and have more income, won't take the road of Soviet farmers, they'll only want to collect interest and buy land, and they'll become rich peasants; some will encounter a couple of things, carry a debt, and lose their entire family fortune. But with the Communist Party leading, they won't let the farmers take the old road, they'll definitely lead us to take the Soviet road, to engage in mutual aid and cooperation." Xiulan said: "Mutual aid and cooperation will constantly improve production, and we'll have more income to support the national construction, and we'll have large factories that manufacture tractors..." The old woman looked at Xiulan with her smiling eyes and said: "Look how much you know!" Xiulan looked at her mother-in-law and said with a smile: "Our group has studied it so many times. Mom, only when we cooperate to plant the crops well can we harvest more grain." The old woman sighed as if she had discovered something new: "That's right, the two mu of wheat on our South Ridge have always been pulled by a small cart for decades, but this year we pulled two big carts at once. Planting the land well is really like one mu being worth two mu." Xiulan took over and said, "Two big carts! You wait and see next year. You see how much bigger the wheat straw stack will be next year!"

The young couple talked and talked until almost midnight, and finally his mother urged them to say, "Go to sleep!" before they left the room. Dongshan's mother was just preparing to go to sleep when Laoding lifted the quilt covering his face and said, "Have they all left?"

"You haven't fallen asleep yet! They've left. What did Dongshan say to you this afternoon?" Dongshan's mother asked.

"He was still talking about the land-buying matter."

"Are you still planning to buy it or not?"

"I can't make up my mind!"

VI

The August morning, like the water in the autumn river, was bright and fresh.

The ripe autumn crops floated the fragrance of the wind, the wind slowly blew the fragrance to the smiling faces of the farmers who planted the crops, blowing into their hearts.

Ever since Song Laoding heard Dongshan and Zhang Shuan talk last night, he got up early this morning to find Dongshan in the field. He was preparing to discuss with Dongshan and decide to dig a well at the head of the lower-lying land first, and install a waterwheel in the autumn. He was walking along a sorghum field when he happened to meet Zhang Shuan coming from the opposite direction. He was just about to go up to greet him when Zhang Shuan hurriedly turned into the sorghum field as if he was deliberately avoiding him.

"Zhang Shuan! Zhang Shuan! I have something to say to you!" He shouted loudly, and Zhang Shuan had no choice but to walk out of the field. Laoding said, "I'll give you 300,000 yuan this afternoon!"

"Lend it to me?" Zhang Shuan asked, surprised.

"If I'm not lending it to you, do you think I still want to buy land! You remember: if you don't work hard to cultivate the land in the future, you'll be letting down even your father!"

After he said that, he walked towards the east, facing the sun step by step.

VII

After dinner, the yard was a white, hazy moonlight, and several crickets were chirping under the Chinese toon tree. Laoding sat blankly in the yard, he always felt that a large group of sounds were disturbing him, sometimes it was the crickets chirping, sometimes it was the clanging of washing dishes, and sometimes it was the sound of Xiulan and her mother-in-law talking and laughing from the kitchen.

"It's really chaotic!" He said, and his brain quickly turned to the things he had encountered during the day, and he couldn't hear the messy sounds anymore.

At this time, someone came in from the gate, calling: "Dongshan!" Laoding heard that it was Zhang Shuan's voice, and said: "He went to the township government." He stood up and said: "Zhang Shuan! Come and sit here." Who knew that Zhang Shuan, after asking Dongshan wasn't home, hastily said: "No, no!" And ran out in three steps and two leaps.

"This young man sees me like he sees a wolf!" He thought, walking to the room, Dongshan's mother asked him: "Is Zhang Shuan still selling the land? Are you lending him that money or not?" "He's probably not selling the land, having the mutual aid group help is enough. We can't lend him that money!" He replied casually.

Footsteps sounded in the yard again, he listened carefully and it was Dongshan and Zhang Shuan's voices. He also heard Dongshan quietly say: "Sit in my room!" The two went to the room. Laoding couldn't hold back anymore. He looked at Dongshan's mother, quietly walked out of the room, and felt that the soles of his shoes were always loud, so he took off his shoes at the threshold, stood barefoot in the yard under the window. There was a lively conversation going on in the room at this time, and he heard Zhang Shuan say:

"People are most afraid of losing their minds in a hurry, I really had no way out those days. I thought, 'If you want to cure a sore, you can't be afraid of cutting off the flesh', sell! I started thinking about selling the land. I was thinking in my heart: 'It's not enough for a carrying pole after all', and go to Zhoukou again, and try another venture, if I get lucky, I'll earn it back."

"Look how terrible your plan is!" This was Dongshan's voice: "Just thinking about trying to get rich quick! How can it work if you don't work hard in production? It's not the old society anymore. You should still weave mats for a few months, and then cultivate the land well, you can't recklessly trade livestock anymore!"

"The day you told me about the future, I decided to do as you said, I decided not to sell the land. Your sister-in-law has been talking to me again these days, when I think of a solution, everything has a way out. People are most afraid of not having anyone to discuss things with. You mobilized Uncle Changshan to lend me five dou of wheat first, he said: Zhang Shuan! Who can't have some things happen!"

"Can the credit cooperative lend you that 200,000 yuan or not?"

"The director of the credit cooperative said there's no problem! Later they said the term is three months. Now it's just seeing if you can lend me some! I'm short 300,000 or 200,000."

Laoding heard this under the window, he took a breath, and heard Dongshan say: "My dad always can't be reasoned with. He's over sixty years old this year, and I don't want to make him angry, he's suffered all his life, and he naturally treasures the money he earned. But don't worry! With the Communist Party's leadership, they'll never let you abandon your livelihood and lose your property, and let your adults and children wander on the streets. I'm preparing to call the people in our mutual aid group to discuss it, and everyone will help you."

Laoding was thinking that he usually watched his child being cold, but he didn't expect that he would think about being afraid of making himself angry, and he heard Dongshan say: "Don't worry! Uncle Changshan lent you some, the credit cooperative lent you some, and I'll find a few people, and everyone will collect some for you, and you can engage in some sideline production. Also, find someone to talk to your wife's sister's husband, and wait until you have income in production, and then pay back his debts gradually, and you'll get through it."

"Dongshan!" He heard Zhang Shuan say excitedly: "You're afraid that others will gossip, don't worry! I know that the elders and young men in our village all know you, you're a Communist Party member, everyone says good things no matter who mentions you, everyone knows who is fair-minded, who is always planning for the masses." Then he said softly: "Everyone also knows that you have a muddle-headed dad, and they won't blame you." He said this sentence very softly, but Laoding heard it very clearly.

"My dad has also changed in the past two years. You know the anger I had with him when I joined the mutual aid group the year before last. Now in the group, he's not afraid of suffering losses on some small things. He's also working very hard, and I think it's no good to hard-separate with him in the past. Like this time, he wanted to buy your land, after my persuasion, his tone changed yesterday. He said: 'We can't buy Zhang Shuan's family's land, his dad and I pushed coal together for a few years, we're both poor people, we can't buy his land.' It's just that he's afraid of Zhang Feng about the money." Dongshan said, laughing, but Zhang Shuan then said: "I also know Uncle Laoding, he's a straightforward person. He also drew crosses for landlords in the past, he knows what selling land tastes like. My dad often said: 'Uncle Laoding and I will inevitably watch the field for people after we die!' Who would have thought that the Communist Party would come

    不能走那一条路
    李准
    编者按：小说“不能走那一条路”，原发表在去年十一月二十日的“河南日报”上。这篇小说，真实、生动地描写了几个不同的农民形象，表现了农村中社会主义思想对农民自发倾向进行斗争的胜利。这是近年来表现农村生活的比较好的短篇小说之一。
    一
    这几天，人人都在谈论着张拴卖地的事情了。
    俗话不俗，“要得穷，翻毛虫”。张拴本来日子倒也能过，四口人种着十几亩地，要是不胡捣腾牲口，地种好，粮食也足够吃。可是他这个人偏偏好掂根鞭杆转牛牙绳，今年春天把一头红牡牛换了个小叫驴，回来做不成活，没喂够十天又卖了。算下来赔了二十多万，想再买个牛犊，也买不住。这时乡干部对他说：“张拴你不要胡翻吧！‘翻拙弄巧，袍子捣个大夹袄’。”可是他偏不服气，向他妻妹夫借了一百万元，一下子到周家口赶回来两条老口牛。到家偏偏碰上麦前霜灾，牛卖不上价。借草借料喂到犁旱地时候，好容易才算推出手，算下来一个驴价赔得干干净净，又欠下他妻妹夫几十万元的账。
    “蹋下窟窿背上账，像黄香膏药贴在身上。”张拴是个小农户，经不起这波折，黑夜白天怎样打算，也过不去这一脚。他妻妹夫见天来要账，连襟亲戚，惹得脸青脸红，他也不想再说软话，就心一横：“卖地！卖‘一杆旗’，拣好地卖，看有人要没有！”
    这“一杆旗”本是村子里头一份好地，形状是三角形，紧靠着流水壕。一年两茬起，谁见谁眼红，是村里有名的“粮食囤”。张拴咬住牙卖这块地，一来是好卖；二来是他算着这二亩地能卖一百多万，剩几个钱再去捞一家伙。因为种地他既种不好，同时他也觉着种地老不解渴。
    一提起张拴卖地，村里人都估摸起来了。有人猜这家，有人猜那家，谁也不能肯定。因为有几家解放后是活泼点，可人家也不一定买地。有两家中农虽然能买起，但是整天装穷，打量他们也不敢动这大本头。最后算是猜到宋老定身上。都知道他这二年翻过来啦，二儿子东林又是个木匠，每一月汇回来几十万。老定又早就吵着要置几亩业，可是还有人不相信，因为他大儿子东山是个共产党员。
    二
    “人眼是秤”，这句话一点也没错说。宋老定今年一连接住东林八封挂号信，一封一封里都有钱。这算把他愁住了，他一辈子没穿过一双洋袜子，可是也舍不得买，他只是把这些钱攒着又攒着。东山今年春天买豆饼，向他要过一次钱，他没给，又一次是互助组里预备合计在下凹地打一眼井，东山又向他要钱，他说：“这几个钱我有用处，到以后你就知道了。”东山是个硬汉子，他不想到爹手里掏这几个钱。不过最近，他才看透他爹原来是想买地。
    宋老定一听说张拴要卖“一杆旗”地，就像他先前娶媳妇时花轿到门口那一会一样，心里又急又高兴，可又没法出去对人说。这几天他东跑西跑地打听着。吃清早饭时就一本正经地把东山叫到屋子里，兴致致地说：“张拴卖地那事情这几天咋说哩？”东山简单地答了一句：“人家不准备卖。”
    老定半天没吭声，东山端着饭碗出去了。
    夜里，东山回来得很晚，见他爹叼着烟袋，不住气地吸。他妈在一边打盹。
    老定看见他回来，就问：“区里有人找你，见他没有？”
   “见他了。”东山说罢很想再说些话，可是他没想好应该咋说。老定是专门等着他要商量买地的事。他想着东山有个别脾气，年轻人得慢慢顺说。
    屋子里静得像没一个人。还是老定先开口，他趁趁摸摸地说：“我今天见王老三，他说张拴赌咒要卖这块地。‘一杆旗’这块地我摸底，那是黑氯土。只要下猛雨水一灌，比上大粪还来劲。”他停了一下使劲地又吸了口烟说：“土地改革时分给张拴，我就想着咋没分给咱。不过咱是干部，当然不能跟他争这块地。现在要是他卖，咱可不能错过这机会！”他说着盯着东山的脸，又说：“做庄稼人啥贵重，还不是得有几亩土！”东山知道他要说这些话，正预备回答，老定又叹了口气说：“我要钱弄啥？还不是给你弟兄们打算，我能跟你们一辈子？”东山笑着说：“张拴那地不卖了，你别听王老三瞎扯。”
    “他不卖！”老定笑了笑：“恐怕他那一屁股账没人给他还！”“他没有多少账。”东山接着振了振精神说起来：“今后晌我和他商量了。卖地不是办法。张拴又不是有三十亩有五十亩，就那十几亩地，卖了咋办！咱和张拴家从前都是贫农，他现在遇住困难，咱要帮助他。咱会能买他这地！”老头听得不耐烦，他风言风语听别人说过：“东山是党员，他不会买地放账。”他想着大概儿子是因为这不敢买，就气冲冲地说：“咱咋不能买？就别人能买！买地卖地是周瑜打黄盖，一家愿打，一家愿挨，两情两愿，又不是凭党员讹他的，有啥不能买！”东山猛不防他爹会说这样话，自己一急就说：“爹！话不是这样说的！张拴卖地是不错，可是他不卖地也行，只不过需要借几十万块钱，咱不能看着人家破产。我已经答应借给他五十万块钱……。”老定没等他说完就问：
      “你啥时候承当他？”他翻着两只带血丝的眼。
      “今后晌承当他。”东山话还没落地，老定忽地一声站起来了。脸别的通红，脖子筋起得大高，他像疯一样喊着：“这是东林挣的钱，不是你挣的，你借！你借！你咋没有把我借给他，你咋没有把你妈借给他！”
    老头气得衣裳一披出去了。东山娘也被惊醒了。她埋怨着说：“你妹子有喜事啦，我问他要过几百回钱，想买点东西他都不给。就想着买地，你还和他争个啥！”
    三
    父子俩闹这一场气不要紧，可慌坏了东山媳妇秀兰。她先跑到麦场上解劝公公，叫他回去。老头冷冷地说：“我不回去，我想坐一会！”接着他又缓缓地交代说：“不用扯旗放炮的，不要弄得谁也知道了。”
    秀兰急忙回到家里，东山正躺在床上出长气。
    “生气了，是不是？”她微笑着坐到床沿上。
      “我也没啥气可生！”东山故意装出平和的样子。秀兰接着埋怨他说：“你还不知道咱爹那心事，他早都把算盘打好了。他给老二买地就叫他买，你管他做啥哩！”东山一听秀兰说这话，就猛地坐起来说：“你怎么也说这话！现在不是说咱买或者别家买，问题是不能看着张拴把地都卖了，他以后怎么过！遇住这种事就得想办法解决。共产党员不是挂个牌子呀！”接着他又缓缓地说：“我自己知道我没尽到责任，麦前我由张拴地边过，看见他地里麦长得像香一样，我就觉得难受。都是贫农，明知道他种庄稼没习惯，也没有去帮助他。赶集人每逢由他地边过，说：‘看这块地的麦，赔不了籽种！’我脸上就像被打一下一样。像你说的我只管自己就好了。”他看着秀兰嘴撇得像个菱角，就用指头捣着她的额头说：“亏你是个青年团员！”
    “你别动手么！”秀兰拨开他的手说：“我问你，你在我跟前耍枪哩，在咱爹跟前你咋不说哩！你既然能说这些，为啥不在咱爹跟前说？”东山笑着说：“我没说完他就走了，我有啥办法！”秀兰故意绷着脸说：“我也得批评批评你。平时你见他连句话也不说，亲父子爷们没有坐到一块说过话。你饭一端，上街了。衣裳一披，上乡政府了。你当你的党员，他当他的农民，遇住事你叫他照你的话办事，他当然和你吵架！”她说着嘴一撇一撇的。东山笑着说：“你倒给我上起课来了。”不过他心里可挺服气。秀兰接着正预备说下去，忽然院子里响着老定“扑蹋”“扑蹋”的脚步声，东山急忙摆了摆手，秀兰住了口。老头到屋里后，东山静听着上房的动静。没听清楚他娘说了句什么，老头接着拉住嗓子说：“他借钱他就借，只要他有钱！那怕他借给人家万贯江山哩！”秀兰推了推东山，吃吃地笑着说：“这是叫你听哩！”
    四
    太阳刚露出鲜红的脸，村子里的早晨是冷清清的，隐隐的吆牛声在田野里喧闹着。
    宋老定没有上地，他整整一夜没睡好觉，翻过来，翻过去，老是想着买地这一件事。天明一起身，他就去到王老三家里。
    王老三解放前给地主当过账房，过去在村里跑来跑去，也算是个“事中人”。这几年村里人没多理他，不过他却挺会巴结人，见老头老婆婆们就给他们“占六爻课”，见了干部就想尽方法说说进步话。过去看见宋老定，眼角就没扫过他；现在他看见村里群众挺拥护东山，见了老定就格外亲热起来。宋老定买地这件事和他商量过，他就跑得像梭子一样。
    老定刚跨进他家大门，他就迎上来说：“咦！老哥，我昨天就预备去找你，张拴那事有门路了。”
    “听说他不想卖了？”老定慢吞吞地问。
    “沤两天也不要紧，反正有我哩。他想借几个钱，不卖地，我说：‘你不憨吧，该卖就得卖，不受那洋症，借钱还是得还账呀！’他心里又有点活了，你放心！”他说着又附在老定的耳朵上说：
  “保险能买到你手里，这地便宜着哩，明年一季麦就把你一多半本捞回来了。”老定讨厌王老三挤眉弄眼地说话，他说：“他真不卖咱也不强买。”王老三这时却拍了一下他的肩头说：“老哥这机会不多，可不能错过！咳，你呀，现在有二十来亩地，再买个十几亩，能飘养住个长工，就雇个长工。”接着他皮笑肉不笑地说：“出一辈子力啦，该歇歇了。”老定听他说着，搭拉着头半天没吭声，他脑子里嗡嗡直响。他在想着：“我真的要雇长工吗？我是扛了十八年长工的人呀！”他走出王老三家大门后，他想起来王老三过去给地主跑着买地也是这股子劲，他又想起在朱家扛活时，掌柜们在大麦天，看着别人黑汗白汗干活，王老三也是摇着扇子站在一边看，他狠狠地吐了一口唾沫说：“去你娘的吧王老三，你是专会浮上水！”
    他一步一步地踱到麦场里，一排麦秸垛出现在他的眼前。他看看这个，比比那个，他想着，“我只要把张拴几亩地买下，哼，到明年麦天就看出谁的麦秸垛大了。”他看着看着自己的麦秸垛慢慢地大了，好像有一群长工在自己场里做活……。他又看那边张拴的麦垛慢慢的小了，小得像草篓子那么大。他猛然想起张拴那一群孩子，在他眼前那一群孩子，都瘦得皮包骨头地向他跑来。他急忙掂着脚走到家里。
    秀兰正和婆婆在厨房里烙馍，两个人一问一答正说的有劲。老定听见媳妇说：“我爹呀！他还是老脑筋……”就赶快站在院子里歪着头听起来。
    “他还不是为你们。他已经半截入土了，还不是为你们打算。人一年一年多了，他能不为你们打算！”老婆这样说着。秀兰却笑着说：“俺们才不叫他打算哩。现在咱是互助组，过年咱村要是成立合作社，咱就参加合作社。将来能用机器种地，还发愁没粮食吃！”老定听着气的胡子都立起来了，他想着遇住个犟儿子，又碰到个别媳妇。
    吃饭时候，秀兰端上了饭。老定脸在一边扭着看都没看。秀兰说：“爹！看凉了，吃罢。”他像没听见。停了一会，他忽然向东山娘说：“我不吃了，我去集上吃肉哩！”他说着抓住几个馍，气忽忽地说：“我给谁省哩，我把八股套绳都拉断了，还落不下好！”他眼睛一翻一翻地瞪着秀兰，秀兰脸朝着墙在暗暗地笑。
    老定确实到集上吃了一顿。不过他没有吃肉，他只吃了一碗豆腐汤煮馍。
    五
    老定和东山闹气有个特别地方，就是越生气越别着干活。那怕是一个人耩地，一个人帮耧，两个人一晌能不答一句腔，可是谁也不会蒙住被子睡大觉。
    春天时候，因为借车，老定不愿意借给人家用，东山却承当了人家。两个为这事闹了一场气，足足有十天没说话。这一次闹气，老定想着最少得半月不答腔。
    天快黑的时候，东山开完党支部会议回来，老定正在喂牛。就装着添草没看见。却不料东山问着：“爹！咱那谷子割后，那块地种成豌豆吧？”老定猛不防儿子会问他。他看了看东山的脸，脸上带着笑，虽然笑得不自然，他知道儿子是来和解来了。就慢悠悠地说：“行吧，那地就得调调茬。”说着就坐在院子里捶布石头上。他想着儿子大概是愿意买地了，就趁趁摸摸地说：“你还年轻呀！啥都没有置几亩土算事！地是根本，我活着不能给你弟兄俩买十亩八亩，我心里总是下不去。你怕啥哩？有我出头买，谁敢说啥。咱也不能光吃花卷馍，咱也得打算打算吃个白馍。哼！敢说咱每年再添六亩旱麦，”他说到这里一挥手说：“麦子就见年吃不完了。”
    “咱现在粮食也不是不够吃！”东山蹲在地下说了一句。
    “不错呀！有是有，可总是不宽绰。”
    东山想着他爹还是这样固执。就把话转到庄稼上。他笑着说：“咱东地那四亩谷子，你看今年能打多少？”老定思摸了半天说：“最少也能弄它一千三四百斤。”东山知道他爹一说别家庄稼好就眼红。就说：“林旺家那谷子今年一亩地能打一大石。人家组里那十九亩谷子一块强似一块，和咱那比起来高一筷子。”老定每逢听见这话就不服气，他哼了一声说：“只要舍得往地里上东西，谁的地也不是‘斋公’。”东山急忙说：“不错，可咱就没有上。咱今年春天要用十万二十万买点细肥上到地里，何止多打三五百斤粮食。”老定说了半天，结果又被东山揭住今年春上的事情。就又变过来说：“光上粪也不中，那得看地里啥土质。林旺那块谷地过去是咱的哩，我能不知道，一块地净是黑氯土，可养苗啦。”东山唯恐他不这样说。听他说到这里就说：“咱咋会把那块地卖给何老大了？”他说着带着埋怨口气。老定看了看孩子的脸，叹了口气说：“你也不用埋怨你爹，提起来这事，我浑身肉都直颤。民国三十二年，两季没收，偏偏你妈就害了月家疾。我那时候正被朱家开消了，回来只得见天推一车子煤卖卖，弄几个钱给你妈拾付药。你那时还小，你那个小妹子咋蹧蹋啦，你娘在床上躺着，我得见天抱着她挨家找奶吃，想叫你外婆来，咱家没粮食；我得做饭，侍候病人，起五更还得去推煤，结果把你那个小妹子活活饿死了。”老定说到这里眼圈红了。他停了一下咬了咬牙又说：“等你妈病好，蹋下一屁股账，麦口期吃地主五升粮食，到麦罢还一斗。四亩地卖给何老大，算下来也不知道找了多钱，反正只够打发药账。”他接着搭拉着头说：“就是那年才把你送去学铜匠，你才十三岁！”他说着偷偷看了看东山从小受过折磨的脸。
    “那时候也没人救济救济咱？”东山反问了一句。
    “救济！乡公所只差没有把穷人骨头磋成扣，有钱人只怕你穷不到底！”他说着咬着牙又说：“那像现在……”他说到这里猛的停住了。东山看出了他爹的心事，他叹了口气，徐徐地说：“张拴现在家里情况和咱那时差不多。”他想了想又说：“咱那困难要是放在现在，就卖不了地了。现在共产党领导就是这样，只要你正干，下力，遇住事政府和大家都能帮助，是叫大家慢慢都提高，不能看着叫那一家破产。”
    老定没吭声，他只觉得额头上的青筋蹦蹦乱跳，脑子里像黄河水一样翻腾着波浪。
    东山看着他爹那样子，就慢慢地说：“爹！过去地主是只恨穷人穷不到底，现在大家是互相帮助，你吃过那苦头，你知道那滋味，咱不能走地主走的那一条路。”老定仍然没吭声，他只觉得脑子里像响起来。
    晚上，老定老早睡了。东山和秀兰都挤在爹屋里和他娘扯闲话。他们算着今年的谷子、玉蜀黍、红薯一共能收多少，算着算着把老婆婆算得眯缝住眼睛，嘴再也合不住了。
    秀兰笑着说：“过年咱种黄谷子，搁住劲，保险咱也能一亩地打五六百斤！”东山娘说：“不胡说吧，谁家一亩地能打五六百斤。”东山紧忙接着说：“有呀娘，俺们参观县农场那谷子，就是能打那么多，将来用机器种地，打的还要多。”秀兰抢着说：“娘，娘你不记得？省里来那电影队演那‘幸福的生活’电影，那大片大片的麦子长的多好，谁看见谁眼热，收麦有收麦机，场里有打谷机；你不记得后来收了麦子，犁地机器一下子犁多宽！”东山娘听到媳妇说起这个电影嘴合不住地说：“真是，看人家机器种、机器收的；吃饭摆的一桌子都是菜，穿那衣裳都是明晃晃的，那日子过哩真舒坦。”“不的咋叫幸福的生活哩！娘，咱们现在是互助组，条件够了，就要成立农业生产合作社，再慢慢发展，等将来成立了集体农庄，就也要过那样的幸福日子哩！……”秀兰还想继续讲下去，可是东山截着她的话说：“幸福日子是总要来的，可就是得照着正路走，不然，有的农民翻了身，收入多了，他不走苏联农民那条路，光想放账、买地，就要变成富农；有的遇见两件啥事情，背了账，倾家荡产。可是有共产党领导，是不会叫农民走老路的，一定要引着咱走苏联那条路，要搞互助合作。”秀兰说：“互助合作，就会不断提高生产，收入多了才好支援国家建设，有了大工厂，制造拖拉机……”老婆婆用笑眯眯的眼看着秀兰说：“看你懂得多少吧！”秀兰看着婆婆嘻笑着说：“俺们团里都学过多少遍啦。娘，只有互助合作起来把庄稼种好，才能多打粮食。”老婆婆好像给发现了什么新的问题似地叹了口气说：“要说也就是，南岭上咱那二亩麦，几十年都是拉一小车，今年一下子拉了两大车。地种好真是一亩顶二亩。”秀兰接过来说：“两大车！过年你等着看。过年麦秸垛你看能比今年大多少！”
    小俩口你一句，我一句，一直说了小半夜，最后还是他娘催他们说：“都去睡吧！”才算走出屋子。东山娘正准备去睡，却不防老定掀开蒙在脸上的被子说：“他们都走了？”
      “你还没睡着呀！他们走了。东山后晌和你说啥哩？”东山娘问。
    “还是说买地那回事。”
    “究竟还打谱买不买？”
    “我也拿不住主意！”
    六
    秋天。柿树林成行地排在地边上，密密的绿叶子，交织在一起像一团帐幕，细细的枝条上，挂着绿色的柿子。
    宋老定脱了一只鞋子，坐在柿树林下的高圪?上。他看看天，天蓝蓝的没有一丝云彩。他看看地，田野里的秋庄稼蓬蓬勃勃地像比赛一样往高处长着。特别是他跟前的一块高粱，穗子扑楞开像一篷小伞，缀满了圆饱饱的像珍珠一样的果实。
    “地种好真是一亩顶二亩。”他自言自语地说了一句，就又想起来这几天他老想的事情了。
    他想着千说万说还是多几亩土算事。以后东林们分家时，一个人能分一二十亩地多好。孙子们早晚提起来说时：“经我爷手买了多少地！”他们也知道他爷爷是“置业手”。他又想起来王老三说的：“过年一季麦就把一多半本捞回来了！”谁嫌地多，全村里地都给自己也不嫌多！况且这是买“一杆旗”这块地，全村头一份好地，不能错过这机会。他想着想着，站了起来一直走到“一杆旗”地里。
    这块地张拴准备种旱麦。眼看快该下种了，还没犁二遍。地里长满了狗尾草。老定对着这些荒草叹了口气。
    他从地里抓起把土，土黑油油地在吸引着他，“还是得买下这块地！”他说着看了看四下没人，就沿着地边走起来，想步步看究竟这块地还有二亩四分没有。
    他由地角仔细地步着，刚转过身子，猛地看见了地中间一堆生满荆梢的黄土堆，那是张拴他爹的坟。
    他心里扑通扑通地跳起来。他本来想不看，可是眼睛却老是往那里瞅。他想起来张拴他爹那样子。张拴他爹是解放前一年死的，耍了一辈子扁担，临死时还没有一份地能埋葬他自己。张拴把他爹的棺材在破窑洞里放了二年，一直到土地改革后，才算把他爹埋到这块地里。他对这事情是一清二楚。他想起来张拴他爹临死时对张拴说：“早晚咱有地，再埋我这老骨头，没有地就不埋，反正我不愿意占地主们的地圪?头！”他想起了这话，又想起解放前那几年受的苦，鼻子一酸，眼泪直想往外涌。没步完地就赶快回村子去了。
    到村头碰见长山老头正推了两半布袋麦。他就问：“到集上卖的？”长山老头笑着说：“不，借给张拴的，听说他准备打席，借给他去合作社卖了买苇子。”
    “你今年打的麦子老多呀！”老定由不得说了这一句。
    “多不多吧，反正够吃了。这放在家里干啥，我又不预备买地！”长山老头这么一说，老定脸刷的一下可红了。长山老头推着麦上村东头了。老定看着他的背影，直想追上前去也碰他几句，可是他总觉得自己有点理曲，他最后说：“你才有几个钱啦，烧哩！”
    七
    吃罢晚饭，院子里是一片白朦朦的月光，几只蟋蟀在椿树下吵闹着。老定呆呆地坐在院子里，他老是觉得一大群声音在烦搅着，一会是蟋蟀叫，一会是洗碗的叮叮当当声，一会又从厨房传出来秀兰和婆婆说笑的声音。
    “真是乱！”他说了一句，脑子又赶快转到白天所碰到的那些事情上去，杂乱的声音他听不见了。
    这时由大门进来个人，叫着：“东山！”老定一听是张拴的声音，就说：“他去乡政府了。”他又立起来说：“张拴！你来这里坐坐。”谁知道张拴一问东山不在家，就慌里慌张地说：“不啦，不啦！”三脚两步地跑出去了。
    “这小伙子见我就像见狼一样！”他思摸着踱到屋子里，东山娘问他：“张拴还卖地不卖？那钱借给他不借？”“地不卖了吧，有互助组帮助就行。咱那钱可不能借！”他漫不经心地回答着。
    院子里又响起了脚步声，他侧耳听着是东山和张拴的声音。又听见东山悄悄地说：“坐到我屋吧！”两个人都去屋了。老定这时候听着下边屋里叽叽哝哝，就再沉不住气了。他看东山娘一眼，轻轻走出屋门，又觉得鞋底子老是响，就把鞋子脱在门槛外，赤着脚，立在院里窗子下。屋里这时正谈得有劲，他听见张拴说：
      “人就怕一急没了主意，那几天我真没法子了。我想着‘想治疮不能怕挖肉’，卖！就想起来卖地。心里想着：‘终究是不够一担挑了’，再去周口赶一趟，捞他一家伙，万一走点运气，就挣回来了。”
    “你看你这打算多怕人！”这是东山的声音：“光想吃飞利！不好好劳动生产那会行？现在可不是旧社会那时候。你还是打几个月席，以后好好种住地，可不敢再胡捣腾牲口了！”
    “你那一天和我说以后，我就决定照住你说的办，决定不卖地。你嫂子这几天也理我了，一想出办法什么都有门路了。人就怕遇住事没有人商量。你动员长山伯先借给我五斗麦子，他说：张拴！谁能没点事！”
    “信贷社那二十万能借不能借？”
    “信贷社主任说没问题！后来他们说三个月期。现在就是看你这里能借点不能！差也是三二十万。”
    老定在窗子下听到这里，他吸了一口气，听见东山说：“我爹总是打不通思想。他今年六十多了，我也不想叫他生气，他受了一辈子苦，弄几个钱自然金贵。不过你放心！有共产党领导，决不能看着叫你弃业变产，大人孩子流落街头。我预备把俺这互助组的人召集起来说说，大家集合一下帮助你一把。”
    老定想着平常看着孩子冷冷的，却想不到他心里会想到怕自己生气，他又听见东山说：“你别着急！长山伯借给你点，信贷社贷给你点，我再找几个人，大家再给你凑点，你就可以搞点副业生产了。另外找人和你妻妹夫说说，等你在生产中有了收入，再陆续还他的账，这就过得去了。”
    “东山！”他听见张拴激动地说：“你是怕别人说闲话，你放心！我知道咱村老少爷们都知道你这人，你是共产党员，不论谁提起你都说好，谁的心公道，谁见天为群众打算，村里人都知道。”接着他又轻轻地说：“谁也知道你有个糊涂爹，不会怪你。”他这句话说的特别轻，可是老定却听得特别清楚。
    “我爹这二年也有转变。你知道前年我参加互助组时，和他生那气。现在在组里，一些小事也不怕吃亏了。他干的也很下劲，我就想着过去我和他硬别也不行。像这次他要买你地，经过我劝说，昨天口气就变了。他说：‘张拴家那地咱不能买，过去我和他爹在一块推了几年煤，都是穷人，咱不能买他的地。’就是借钱这事他怕张风。”东山说着笑起来，张拴却接着说：“我也知道老定叔，他这人是直心人。他过去也给地主划过十字，他知道那卖地啥滋味。我爹常说：‘我和你老定叔将来死后都免不了给人家看地头！’谁想来了共产党，要是我爹活到现在……”
    老定听到这里再也听不下去了，他用手使劲的捂住要流泪的眼，走到屋里，像一捆柴倒在地上一样倒在床上。
    八
    八月的清早，像秋天河里的水一样明朗、新鲜。
    熟透了的秋庄稼，随风飘荡香味，风徐徐地把这香味吹到种这些庄稼人的笑脸上，吹到他们心里。
    宋老定只从昨天晚上听了东山和张拴说话以后，大清早就起来去地里找东山，他准备和东山商量一下，决定先在下凹地头打一眼井，秋后再安装一部水车。他顺着一块高粱地走着，恰巧碰见张拴由对面走来。他正想上去打招呼，张拴好像故意回避的样子急忙拐到高粱地里。
    “张拴！张拴！我有话要和你说！”他大声喊着，张拴只得从地里走出来。老定说：“后晌到我家给你三十万块钱！”
    “借给我的？”张拴瞪着眼吃惊地问。
