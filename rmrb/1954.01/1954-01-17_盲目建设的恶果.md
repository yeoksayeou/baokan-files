The Disastrous Consequences of Blind Construction
    Sun Zhongfu, Liu Feng

    When you get off the train at Luoyang Station, not far from the station, you can see a newly built factory - the Luoyang Cotton Baling Factory.

    This baling factory was proposed in 1950 by the former China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, Central South District Company. The China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company's National Manager Conference approved it, and the former Central Ministry of Trade approved the investment and construction. This project, which had been studied, reviewed, and approved at various levels, should have been relatively reasonable in theory, but that was not the case in reality.

    When the baling factory started construction in 1951, there was no overall design plan. By 1952, when the capital construction was fully underway, the detailed construction drawings and budget had not yet arrived at the factory. The baling factory had no cars, but three car garages were built. There was no sewer system locally, but flush toilets were built. Because they could not be used, more than 10 million yuan was spent to build a septic tank. The cement roads were built very flat and slippery, making it impossible for large cotton trucks to drive, so a layer of furnace ash had to be laid. The baling machines are old-fashioned, estimated to be usable for only fifteen years at most, but the baling buildings in the factory are all reinforced concrete structures, guaranteed to last for fifty years. According to preliminary estimates, waste caused by improper planning, design, construction, and management will reach 2 billion yuan, accounting for more than one-sixth of the total investment.

    But the serious problem does not lie here. Originally, according to the production capacity of this baling factory, it could complete the baling of 300,000 dan of cotton per year. In fact, the total annual cotton output of Luoyang Prefecture is only about 250,000 dan. After deducting civilian cotton and the processing portion of the province, only about 140,000 dan need to be baled for external transfer. After production started last October, there was a phenomenon of work stoppage due to lack of materials. It is estimated that the equipment utilization rate is only about 14 percent. At the same time, according to the national construction policy, a yarn factory will soon be established near the baling factory, eliminating the need to bale cotton for external transfer. Therefore, when the baling factory just started production, the questions of how to switch to other industries and how to stop production were simultaneously raised.

    To start work, there are no raw materials; to close the doors, it is impossible to close. This baling factory, which took three years, was approved at all levels, and cost 11.5 billion yuan to build, has become a "burden" that one wants to get rid of but cannot, and cannot bear to carry.

    盲目建设的恶果
    孙钟福　刘逢
    当你从洛阳车站下车，在走出车站不远的地方，就可看到一座新建的工厂——洛阳棉花打包厂。
    这个打包工厂，是在一九五○年由前中国花纱布公司中南区公司提出建厂意见，经中国花纱布公司全国经理会议通过，前中央贸易部批准投资建筑的。这个经过层层研究、审核、批准建筑的工程，照理应该是比较合理的，但事实却不是如此。
    打包工厂在一九五一年开工时，还没有全盘的设计计划，到一九五二年基本建设全面开始时，施工详图和预算还没有到厂。打包厂没有汽车，却盖了三间汽车房。当地没有下水道，却建筑了抽水厕所，因为不能使用，又花了一千多万元造化粪池。水泥交通道造得又平又滑，运棉花的大车不能行走，不得不铺上一层炉灰。打包机是旧式的，估计顶多只能使用十五年，但工厂中的打包楼却全部是钢筋水泥结构，保证能用五十年。据初步估计，由于计划、设计、施工、管理不当而造成的浪费，将达二十亿元，占全部投资的六分之一强。
    但严重的问题还不在此。原来按照这个打包厂的生产能力，全年可完成三十万担棉花的打包任务。事实上，洛阳专区全年的棉产量只有二十五万担左右，减去民用棉及本省加工部分外，需要打包外调的只有十四万担左右。去年十月开始生产后，就发生停工待料的现象，估计设备利用率仅在百分之十四左右。同时根据国家建设的方针，不久将在打包厂附近建立纱厂，更不需要把棉花打包外调。因此，在打包厂刚刚开始生产的时候，同时提出了如何转业和停工的问题。
    要开工，没有原料，关门，又关不了，这个费时三年，经过层层批准，耗费一百一十五亿元资金建筑的打包厂，变成了欲甩不得，欲背不起的“包袱”。
