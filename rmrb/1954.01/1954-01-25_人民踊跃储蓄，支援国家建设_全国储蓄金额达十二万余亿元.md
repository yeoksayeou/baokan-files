    People Enthusiastically Save, Supporting National Construction
    National Savings Amount Reaches Over 12 Trillion Yuan
    Due to the people's enthusiastic savings supporting national construction, the People's Bank of China's national savings deposits are rapidly increasing year by year. Taking the total national savings deposits of 100.7 billion yuan at the end of 1949 as a base, it increased 10.7 times in 1950, 46.5 times in 1951, 76.5 times in 1952, and reached over 12.77 trillion yuan by the end of 1953 (of which urban savings deposits were over 10.076 trillion yuan, and rural savings deposits were over 2.03 billion yuan), which is an increase of 126 times compared to 1949.
    The number of savings accounts has also gradually increased. At the end of January 1951, the number of national fixed and current savings deposit accounts was 800,000, at the end of 1951 it was 3.05 million, at the end of 1952 it was 6.55 million, and by the end of 1953 it had grown to over 10 million (excluding rural areas), an increase of nearly 12 times compared to January 1951.
    The proportion of fixed savings in various savings types has also gradually increased. At the end of 1950, it was 18.2 percent, and by the end of September 1953, it accounted for 44.2 percent.
    Due to the people's enthusiastic participation in savings, scattered funds have been concentrated in the national bank to support national construction, and they have also received interest from the state, increasing their income. In 1952 alone, the People's Bank paid out 780 billion yuan in deposit interest and bonuses.

    人民踊跃储蓄，支援国家建设
    全国储蓄金额达十二万余亿元
    由于人民踊跃储蓄支援国家建设，中国人民银行全国储蓄存款正逐年迅速增加。以一九四九年年底全国储蓄存款总额一千零七亿元为基数，一九五零年增加一零·七倍，一九五一年增加四六·五倍，一九五二年增加七六·五倍，至一九五三年年底已达十二万七千余亿元（其中城市储蓄存款为十万零七千六百余亿元，农村储蓄存款为二万零三百余亿元），即比一九四九年增加一二六倍。
    储蓄户数也逐步增加。一九五一年一月底全国定期及活期储蓄存款户数为八十万户，一九五一年年底为三百零五万户，一九五二年年底为六百五十五万户，至一九五三年年底已发展到一千万户以上
  （不包括农村），比一九五一年一月增加近十二倍。
    定期储蓄在各种储蓄中的比重也逐步增加。一九五零年年底为百分之十八点二，至一九五三年九月底已占百分之四十四点二。
    由于人民踊跃参加储蓄，把零散资金集中到国家银行支援了国家建设，因而也获得了国家给予的利息，增加了自己的收入。仅一九五二年人民银行即付出达七千八百亿元的存款利息和奖金。
