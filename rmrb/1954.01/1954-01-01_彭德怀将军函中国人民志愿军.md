Dear comrades, commanders and soldiers:

We bid farewell to 1953 and welcome the arrival of 1954 with infinite joy and excitement.

In 1953, we faithfully carried out the glorious and sacred tasks entrusted to us by the people of the motherland. With the full support of the people of the motherland and the Korean people, and with the support and assistance of peace-loving people all over the world, we fought bravely alongside the Korean People's Army. On the east and west coasts, we built strong fortifications, preventing the enemy from landing and invading. On the front lines, we launched a victorious summer counter-offensive, severely打击[dǎ jī - strike; hit; attack; crack down on]打击 the enemy's arrogance against the armistice and促成[cù chéng - help to bring about; facilitate; contribute to]促成 the realization of the Korean armistice. After the armistice, we worked tirelessly with the Korean people and army to prevent American imperialism from invading and to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The achievements of our struggle in the past year have been enormous. As this new year arrives, we extend our warm congratulations to all comrades!

In the new year, our task is to continue to abide by the armistice agreement, hold our positions,提高[tí gāo - to raise; to increase]提高 vigilance, and prevent any enemy侵袭[qīn xí - to invade; to intrude]侵袭 and provocative actions. If the enemy dares to invade, we will certainly give them a firm and forceful retaliation. While guarding against the enemy, we must intensify training,提高[tí gāo - to raise; to increase]提高 culture, and提高[tí gāo - to raise; to increase]提高 our military and political levels, strengthen our combat effectiveness, and further regularize and modernize our army. We must also continue to help the Korean people rebuild their homes, further consolidate and strengthen the fighting friendship between the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and strive to ensure the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

In the past year, all of us comrades have won brilliant victories and gained great honor with our selfless spirit of struggle. In the new year, we must continue to maintain and promote honor, avoid arrogance and懈怠[xiè dài - slack; remiss; negligent], and make ourselves truly worthy of the glorious title of the most beloved people.

Dear comrades! The motherland has successfully carried out the first year of the first five-year construction plan. In order to ensure that the motherland safely and gradually transitions to socialism, and in order to defend world peace, we must continue to struggle unremittingly. We must use the greatest enthusiasm to conscientiously study the general line of the country during the transition period. Under the brilliant light of the general line, we will examine and improve our work in all aspects, strive to提高[tí gāo - to raise; to increase]提高 our ideological level, and advance more firmly towards the bright road guided by the general line!

Comrades! The even more brilliant and splendid 1954 has begun. Let us move forward in unison and bravely!

I wish you all progress in the New Year!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, who guide us to eternal victory!

    我们以无限欢欣鼓舞的心情向一九五三年告别，迎接一九五四年的到来。
    一九五三年中，我们忠诚地执行了祖国人民交给我们的光荣神圣的任务。我们在祖国人民和朝鲜人民的全力支援下，在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持与援助下，和朝鲜人民军一道，进行了英勇的斗争。在东西海岸，我们建立了强固的工事，使敌人不敢登陆进犯。在正面战线，我们举行了胜利的夏季反击战役，严重地打击了敌人反停战的气焰，促成了朝鲜停战的实现。停战后，我们和朝鲜军民一起，为防止美帝国主义侵略和争取朝鲜问题的和平解决作了不懈的努力。过去一年中，我们斗争的成就是巨大的，在此新的一年到来之时，我们特向全体同志致以热烈的祝贺！
    在新的一年中，我们的任务就是要继续遵守停战协定，坚守阵地，提高警惕，防止敌人的任何侵袭和挑衅行动。如果敌人敢于进犯，我们一定给以坚决的有力的还击。在戒备敌人的同时，我们要加紧训练，提高文化，提高军事和政治水平，加强战斗力，使我军进一步正规化、现代化。我们还要继续帮助朝鲜人民重建家园，进一步巩固并加强与朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军间的战斗友谊，为保障朝鲜停战协定的彻底实施，为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗。
    过去一年，我们全体同志以忘我奋斗的精神，赢得了辉煌的胜利，获得了极大的荣誉。在新的一年中，我们要继续保持与发扬荣誉，不骄不懈，使我们真正无愧于最可爱的人的光荣称号。
    亲爱的同志们！祖国已胜利地进行了第一个五年建设计划的第一年的建设，为了保证祖国安全地逐步过渡到社会主义，为了保卫世界和平，我们一定要继续奋斗不懈。我们一定要用最大的热忱来认真学习国家在过渡时期的总路线。在总路线的光辉照耀下，检查和改进我们的各项工作，努力提高我们的思想水平，更坚定地向总路线所指引的光明大道前进！
    同志们！更为光辉灿烂的一九五四年开始了，让我们步伐一致地、勇敢地前进吧！
    祝大家新年进步！
    引导着我们永远胜利前进的中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
