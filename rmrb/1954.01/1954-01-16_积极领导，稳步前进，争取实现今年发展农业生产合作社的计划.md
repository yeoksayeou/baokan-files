Actively Lead, Advance Steadily, and Strive to Realize this Year's Plan for Developing Agricultural Production Cooperatives

According to the plans of the major administrative regions, by the autumn harvest this year, including the original more than 14,000 agricultural production cooperatives, the country will have a total of about 45,000 agricultural production cooperatives. The realization of this plan will bring about a great leap forward in China's agricultural cooperation, a considerable development of socialist factors in the countryside, and a tremendous change in the face of the entire rural area. All rural work comrades must take on this glorious task.

However, having a plan is only the beginning of things. To complete this major and arduous task, it is also necessary to do a lot of practical work and overcome many difficulties. Therefore, every leading comrade in rural work must adhere to the principle of developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement repeatedly pointed out by the Central Committee: actively lead and advance steadily.

Why is it necessary to actively lead? On the one hand, because organizing farmers to engage in production through the mutual aid and cooperation movement is a major event in the socialist transformation of agriculture. In the past, rural work comrades in various places had also done many good things for farmers, providing them with much material and technical assistance; however, these things were mostly done on the basis of the individual economy, so they could not fundamentally help farmers get rid of poverty and achieve common prosperity. In the past, although some mutual aid and cooperation organizations were developed, the speed and scale of development were not as large as this year's plan. Therefore, if we do not actively lead this work with the greatest enthusiasm, the plan is in danger of falling through, and the major task of socialism will be missed. On the other hand, after the general line was publicized in the countryside, the enthusiasm of the peasant masses for mutual aid and cooperation has greatly increased. In Xizhanggeng Township, Jie County, Shanxi, nine mutual aid teams recently requested to be transformed into agricultural production cooperatives, and another 120 households requested to join the cooperatives, plus the original farmers in the agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for more than 38 percent of the total number of households in the township. This proves that there is great potential for running cooperatives; if we do not actively lead, we will lag behind the demands of the masses and become seriously divorced from the masses.

Why is it necessary to advance steadily? This is because what we are facing today is the rural area where the small-scale peasant economy dominates. For thousands of years, Chinese farmers have been producing and operating independently, and the habits of being scattered are deeply rooted. It will take a considerable amount of time to guide them all to the path of agricultural collectivization, so we must take steady steps forward. In the winter of the year before last and the spring of last year, some places demanded too much too quickly, disregarding the degree of awareness of the masses and the possible conditions at the time and place, blindly developing a large number of agricultural production cooperatives, accumulating public property too quickly and too much, and blindly seeking to run large cooperatives. This was advancing without being steady, which hindered the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. When correcting this deviation, individual places were steady without advancing, and even a gust of wind blew down and dissolved some agricultural production cooperatives that were originally in a condition to be run well. This is also wrong. Therefore, today we must not only recognize the need and possibility of developing agricultural production cooperatives, and not be at a loss in the face of the plan for large-scale development; but also carefully study various practical conditions and strive to create conditions so that our plan is truly built on a reliable foundation and can be smoothly realized.

What mass conditions are needed to establish new cooperatives? There are three main ones: First, the masses must be truly voluntary; second, there must be leading backbone members; and third, generally speaking, there must be a basis for mutual aid.

The true voluntary union of the masses is the most important condition for running a cooperative. Lenin repeatedly emphasized that it is extremely harmful to use force against farmers when establishing cooperatives; "to use force here is tantamount to ruining the entire undertaking." However, on the other hand, it must never be thought that farmers can spontaneously embark on the path of socialism. If we do not carry out arduous persuasion and education work among the farmers, they often cannot know the benefits of voluntarily uniting for production. Therefore, as Lenin pointed out: "Since it is said that voluntary consent must be obtained, that is to say, to persuade the peasants, to persuade the peasants in practice." "Long-term educational work is needed here. Farmers are practical people, pragmatic people, not only in our country, but all over the world. We should show them concrete examples to prove that 'Communism' (note: referring to Communism) is the best thing." "Farmers need a supply of urban industrial products... first give help, and then win trust." ("Report on Rural Work at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)") Therefore, to make farmers voluntarily unite, only three methods can be adopted: one is persuasion, one is demonstration, and one is assistance. The Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives also tells us this.

The most effective way to persuade farmers to take the road of collectivization is to prove to them, based on the facts of their daily lives and the personal experiences they have gained in the past, that individual farming has many difficulties, and only by joining cooperatives can they finally get rid of poverty and achieve common prosperity. In the daily lives of farmers, there are many facts that can illustrate the difficulties of individual farming. Whether poor or middle peasants, they all have difficulties with insufficient farm tools, livestock, and labor, they do not have enough strength to resist natural disasters and prevent diseases, they do not have sufficient conditions to improve technology, and it is difficult for them to avoid being exploited by usurers, speculators, and rich peasants. Not to mention before liberation, even after the land reform, wherever the mutual aid and cooperation movement has not developed, a few individual farmers have gone bankrupt again; the lives of some individual farmers have not improved much, they think about getting rich every day, but they are always unable to get rich, and they are very unstable. Repeatedly and constantly reminding farmers of this situation with real people and real events in the local area, farmers can be persuaded. In the personal experience of farmers, there are also some facts that can illustrate the necessity of uniting. The mutual aid habits that originally existed among the peasant masses, the experience already gained in organizing supply and marketing cooperatives, and the experience of the peasant masses in organizing to eliminate feudal exploitation in the land reform can all make everyone understand the benefits of uniting. Comparing the benefits of uniting with the situation of not uniting with specific local examples, farmers can voluntarily unite.

Demonstration is also a kind of persuasion, and it is a more powerful persuasion. General persuasion is mainly based on the facts that farmers have personally experienced in the past, so it can only inspire farmers to abandon the old road; adding demonstration can not only make farmers more determined to take the new road, but also enable farmers to know how to take the new road. How to demonstrate? Generally speaking, there are several ways: one is to demonstrate with state-owned farms, so that the peasant masses can see with their own eyes that relatively large-scale agriculture is indeed better than scattered small-scale farming, and the use of machines and new farm tools and advanced technology is indeed better than using old cattle and clumsy plows and old methods of farming. One is to demonstrate with agricultural production cooperatives that have already been run well, so that farmers can see that uniting can indeed produce more grain and increase income, and various systems within the cooperatives are indeed reasonable; at the same time, we must also use the actual actions of agricultural production cooperatives in uniting and helping mutual aid teams and individual farmers to make everyone see that agricultural production cooperatives are indeed for the benefit of all farmers. Now, many places already have agricultural production cooperatives, and most of them have been run well. To seriously summarize the agricultural production cooperatives that have already been run well in the local area, publicize them to the masses, and organize the masses to visit and interview them in a planned and prepared manner is the most effective way to educate the broad masses of farmers to voluntarily organize agricultural production cooperatives. For example, Changzhi Prefecture in Shanxi adopted the method of typical demonstration. In 1951, it ran ten agricultural production cooperatives well, and in 1952, it developed to more than 100; most of the more than 100 cooperatives were run well, and in 1953, it developed to more than 980. These more than 980 cooperatives planted more than 255,800 mu of autumn fields in 1953, an increase of more than 14.9 million jin compared with last year, with an average yield of 310 jin per mu, which is more than 30 percent higher than the average yield of autumn fields in the entire prefecture. Therefore, many farmers are actively demanding to join the cooperatives again. Last December alone, more than 2,600 households in Pingshun, Changzhi, and Changzi counties automatically applied to join the cooperatives.

In addition, the state's assistance to agricultural production cooperatives is also an indispensable condition for promoting farmers' voluntary participation in cooperatives. As Lenin said, cooperatives are an initiative, a newborn cause, and the ruling working class has an obligation to use the materials it possesses to give it strong support. In the past, our country has also given farmers a lot of help. In the future, in order to use the state's help more effectively to promote the development of agricultural production cooperatives, rural work cadres in various places should grasp several principles: First, the amount of the loan should be appropriate. Too much will make the cooperative unable to afford it, and it will also make the cooperative alienated from the masses and unable to play a better demonstrative role; too little cannot have a significant effect, and it will lose the meaning of the loan. Second, the loan should be concentrated on agricultural basic construction and used to expand production. Third, technical promotion stations and new farm tool stations should sign contracts with cooperatives, maintain close contact with cooperative members, and at the same time, they cannot take over everything and make cooperative members develop a dependence mentality. Fourth, all assistance should appropriately favor agricultural production cooperatives, but the actual needs of mutual aid teams and individual farmers should also be taken into account. With practical assistance that meets these principles, the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives can be more fully demonstrated; it can not only consolidate existing cooperatives, but also attract more farmers to voluntarily participate in or establish new cooperatives.

Only with the voluntary participation of the masses, without strong leading backbone members, it is impossible to run agricultural production cooperatives well. What kind of people can be leading backbone members? The most important conditions are fairness, competence, and active work. Where do such leading backbone members come from? Naturally, they are produced from the masses, first from the mutual aid teams. The county and district party committees are responsible for constantly cultivating them, and they must also be trained centrally at certain times; after the cooperative is established, they must continue to be educated. When judging who is fair and competent, and who can be a leading backbone member of the cooperative, it is necessary to pay attention: the party committee cannot choose them alone, nor can they be designated by one person or a few people, but the opinions of the masses must be widely solicited, and a democratic election by the masses must be held when the cooperative is established. The leading backbone members must be truly supported by the cooperative members.

When establishing agricultural production cooperatives, the mutual aid and cooperation habits of the masses are also an important condition. Generally speaking, mutual aid teams are the foundation of agricultural production cooperatives. Because the voluntary establishment of cooperatives by the masses and the emergence of leading backbone members of cooperatives are inseparable from mutual aid teams. In mutual aid teams, the masses can develop preliminary habits of collective labor and gain preliminary experience in assessing work points or calculating by piece. With the habits and experience of mutual aid, farmers can more easily understand the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives, and the difficulties in establishing agricultural production cooperatives can be reduced. Therefore, generally speaking, the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement is best from small to large, from low to high. However, in areas with relatively developed economy and culture, if the masses are more aware and there are suitable leading backbone members, it is possible to establish cooperatives directly; it is also possible to start by trying out some agricultural production cooperatives. However, such situations are not available everywhere; even in such places, it is impossible for all farmers to join production cooperatives all at once; therefore, it is still necessary to run mutual aid teams well and prepare better conditions for the continued development of cooperatives.

Whether we actively lead or steadily advance is mainly manifested in the number, speed, and scale of establishing agricultural production cooperatives; after agricultural production cooperatives are established, it is mainly manifested in the amount and speed of accumulating public property, the amount of production investment, and the size of the proportion of labor and land dividends. How much is too much, how much is too little, how fast is too fast, how slow is too slow, how big is too big, and how small is too small, all depend on the specific conditions and specific conditions at the time and place to determine. In terms of the speed of development, generally speaking, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in new areas is slower than in old areas. However, in some new areas, the cadres are stronger, the masses have higher culture, the population is concentrated, and the terrain is flat. If a few typical examples are run well, they may develop quickly. In terms of the size of the cooperative, generally speaking, it should be from small to large, and it is difficult to run large cooperatives; but it is not necessarily necessary to run small cooperatives first at any time and in any place. In short, the leadership should pay attention to absorbing and summarizing the experience of the masses, and not subjectively use a specification to apply everywhere. The accumulation of public property, production investment, and dividend ratio are the same. It is necessary to judge how much is too much and how much is too little according to the degree of awareness of the masses and the actual needs of production development at the time and place. If we want to find an unchangeable principle, that is: to ensure that the socialist component gradually and continuously increases, and to ensure that the actual interests of each cooperative member can gradually and continuously increase every year.

After the initial propaganda and education of the general line and the patriotic grain sales campaign, the enthusiasm of the peasant masses in various places for taking the socialist road is generally rising. Party committees at all levels in various places should cherish the enthusiasm of the masses, actively lead and steadily advance, appropriately rectify and expand the original more than 14,000 cooperatives according to specific conditions, and make every effort to run the more than 30,000 newly established cooperatives as well as possible, and strive to fully realize the 1954 plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives.

    积极领导，稳步前进，争取实现今年发展农业生产合作社的计划
    按照各大行政区的计划，到今年秋收以前，连原有的一万四千多个农业生产合作社在内，全国总共要办起四万五千个左右农业生产合作社来。这个计划的实现，将使我国农业合作化事业有一个大的跃进，使农村社会主义因素有相当大的发展，使整个农村的面貌有巨大的改变。全体农村工作同志都要把这个光荣的任务担当起来。
    但是有了计划，还只是事情的开头。要完成这个重大艰巨的任务，还需要切实地做许多工作，克服许多困难。因此，每个农村工作的领导同志，都必须坚持中央再三指出的开展互助合作运动的原则：积极领导，稳步前进。
    为什么要积极领导呢？一方面，因为通过互助合作运动，把农民组织起来进行生产，这乃是农业社会主义改造的一件大事。过去各地农村工作同志们也曾为农民办了许多好事，从物质上、技术上给了农民许多帮助；但是这些事情多半还是在个体经济的基础上办的，所以还不能从根本上帮助农民摆脱贫困、共同富裕。过去虽然也发展了一些互助合作组织，但发展的速度和规模也不像今年的计划这样大。因此，如果不以最大的热情来积极领导这项工作，计划就有落空的危险，就会误了社会主义的大事。另一方面，在农村进行了总路线的宣传以后，农民群众互助合作的积极性大为提高。山西解县西张耿乡，最近就有九个互助组要求转为农业生产合作社，另外还有一百二十户要求入社，加上原来农业生产合作社的农户，共占全乡总户数的百分之三十八强。这就证明办社的潜在力很大；如果不积极领导，就要落后于群众的要求，就会严重地脱离群众。
    为什么要稳步前进呢？这是因为我们今天面对着的乃是小农经济占优势的农村。几千年来，我国农民都是一家一户各自生产各自经营的，分散的习惯是根深蒂固的，要引导他们全部走向农业合作化的道路，是需要相当长的时间才能完成的，因此我们必须采取稳步前进的步骤。前年冬天和去年春天，有些地方要求过急，不顾当时当地群众觉悟的程度和可能的条件，盲目大量发展农业生产合作社，过急过多地积累公共财产，盲目贪办大社，前进而不稳步，结果反而阻碍了互助合作运动的发展。在纠正这个偏向时，个别的地方，又稳步而不前进，甚至一股风吹下去，把一些本来有条件办好的农业生产合作社也解散了。这同样是错误的。因此，今天我们既要认清发展农业生产合作社的需要和可能，不要在大量发展的计划面前手足失措；也要认真研究各种实际条件，并努力去创造条件，使我们的计划真正建筑在可靠的基础之上，能够顺利地实现。
    建立新社要有些什么群众条件呢？主要的有三条，就是：一、群众真正自愿；二、有领导骨干；三、一般说来要有互助基础。
    群众真正自愿联合起来，是办社的最重要的条件。列宁一再强调指出，在建立合作社的时候，用强力对待农民，是极有害的；“在这里采用强力，就等于葬送全部事业”。但是，另一方面，也决不能认为农民是可以自流地走上社会主义道路的。我们如果不向农民进行艰巨的说服教育工作，他们往往是不能知道自愿联合起来进行生产的好处的。因此，也正如列宁指出的：“既然说必须求得自愿同意，也就是说，要说服农民，要在实践中说服农民。”“这里需要有长期的教育工作。农民不仅在我国，而且在全世界上都是实际主义者，都是务实的人，我们应当向他们作出具体的例子来证明‘康姆尼’（按：指共产主义）是最好的东西。”“农民需要有城市工业品的供给，……首先实行帮助，然后去夺得信任吧。”（“在俄共（布）第八次代表大会上关于农村工作的报告”）因此要使农民自愿地联合起来，只能采取三种方法：一是说服，一是示范，一是帮助。中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议也正是这样告诉我们的。
    要说服农民走合作化的道路，最有效的办法就是根据农民日常生活中的事实，根据农民过去得到的切身的经验，向农民证明：单干是有很多困难的，只有参加合作社才能最后摆脱贫困、共同富裕起来。在农民的日常生活中，能说明单干困难的事实是很多的。无论贫农中农，都有农具、牲畜、劳力不足的困难，都没有足够的力量抵抗天灾与防御疾病，都没有充分的条件改进技术，都很难避免受高利贷者、投机商人、富农的剥削。不要说解放以前，就是在土地改革以后，凡是互助合作运动没有发展起来的地方，也有少数单干户又破产了；一些单干农民的生活改善不多，每天想富裕，却总是富裕不起来，而且很不稳定。用当地的真人真事反复地经常地提醒农民注意这种情形，农民是能够被说服的。在农民的切身经验中，也有一些事实能说明联合起来的必要。农民群众中原有的一些互助习惯，在组织供销合作社中已有的经验，和农民群众在土地改革中组织起来消灭了封建剥削的经验，都能使大家了解联合起来的好处。用当地的具体事例把联合起来的好处和不联合起来的情形对比一下，农民是能够自愿地联合起来的。
    示范，也是一种说服，而且是一种更有力的说服。一般的说服，主要是根据农民过去亲自经历的事实，所以还只能启发农民决心抛弃旧道路；再加上示范，就不但能使农民更坚决地走新道路，而且能使农民知道怎样走新道路。怎样示范呢？一般地说有这样几种方法：一是用国营农场示范，使农民群众亲眼看到比较大规模的农业确实比分散的小农好，采用机器和新式农具、先进技术确实比用老牛笨犁、老办法种地好。一是用已经办好的农业生产合作社示范，使农民看到联合起来确实能多打粮食、增加收入，社内的各种制度确实合情合理；同时还要用农业生产合作社团结、帮助互助组和单干农民的实际行动，使大家看到农业生产合作社确实是为着全体农民的利益的。现在，很多地方都已经有了农业生产合作社，而且绝大部分是办好了的。对于当地已经办好的农业生产合作社，认真地作出总结，向群众进行宣传，并且有领导有准备地组织群众去参观、访问，这是教育广大农民群众自愿组织农业生产合作社的最有效的办法。像山西长治专区，采取了典型示范方法，一九五一年办好了十个农业生产合作社，一九五二年就发展到一百多个；一百多个社大多数都办好了，一九五三年就发展到了九百八十多个。这九百八十多个社一九五三年种秋田二十五万五千八百多亩，比去年增产一千四百九十多万斤，平均每亩产三百一十斤，比全专区秋田平均每亩产量高百分之三十多。因此，就又有许多农民积极要求入社。去年十二月，只是平顺、长治、长子三县，自动报名要求入社的就已经有二千六百多户。
    此外，国家对农业生产合作社的帮助，也是促进农民自愿地参加合作社的必不可少的条件。正如列宁所说的，合作社是一种创举，是新生的事业，执政的工人阶级有义务运用自己所掌握的物资，给它以有力的支持。过去，我们的国家也曾给农民很多帮助，今后为了更有效地运用国家的帮助，用以促进农业生产合作社的发展，各地农村工作干部应当掌握几个原则：一、贷款的数目要适当，过多了会使合作社负担不起，而且会使合作社脱离群众，不能更好地起示范作用；太少了不能有显著的作用，也就失去了贷款的意义。二、贷款要集中用于农业基本建设、用于扩大生产。三、技术推广站、新式农具站要和合作社订好合同，和社员群众密切联系，同时又不能包办代替，使社员产生依赖思想。四、一切帮助要适当地优待农业生产合作社，但也应当照顾互助组和单干农民的实际需要。有了合乎这些原则的实际帮助，农业生产合作社的优越性就能更充分地显示出来；不但能巩固已有的合作社，并且能吸引更多农民自愿地参加或新建合作社。
    只是群众自愿，没有较强的领导骨干，也是不能把农业生产合作社办好的。什么样的人才能做领导骨干呢？最重要的条件就是公道、能干，办事积极。这样的领导骨干从那里来？自然是从群众中产生出来，首先是从互助组中产生出来的。县区党委要负责经常地加以培养，在一定的时间还要集中地加以训练；在合作社建立起来以后，仍要不断地给以教育。在判断那些人公道、能干，那些人可以做办社的领导骨干的时候，需要注意：不能只靠党委来选择、不能只是由一个人或少数人指定，一定要普遍征求群众的意见，建社时还一定要经过群众民主选举。领导骨干一定要是社员群众真正拥护的。
    创办农业生产合作社时，群众互助合作的习惯也是一个重要的条件。一般地说，互助组是农业生产合作社的基础。因为群众的自愿办社、办社的领导骨干的产生，都是和互助组分不开的。群众在互助组中，可以养成集体劳动的初步习惯，取得评工记分或按件计分的初步经验。有了互助的习惯和经验，农民对农业生产合作社的好处是比较容易理解的，创办农业生产合作社的困难也可以少一些，因此一般的说来，农村互助合作运动的发展，最好是由小到大，由低级到高级。但在经济、文化比较发达的地方，如果群众觉悟较高，又有合适的领导骨干，直接建社是可能的；也可以一开始就试办一些农业生产合作社。不过这样的情形并不是到处都有的；就是在这样的地方，也不可能一下子使全体农民都加入生产合作社；因此办好互助组，为合作社的继续发展准备更好的条件，仍然是很必要的。
    是不是积极领导，是不是稳步前进，在建立农业生产合作社的过程中，主要表现在建社数目的多少、速度的快慢、规模的大小；在办起农业生产合作社以后，主要表现在积累公共财产的多少和快慢、生产投资的多少、劳力和土地分红比例的大小。究竟怎样算多了、怎样算少了，怎样算快了、怎样算慢了，怎样算大了、怎样算小了，都要看当时当地具体情况具体条件才能断定。就发展的速度来说，一般地讲，现在新区的互助合作运动是要比老区发展得慢一些。可是，新区有些地方干部较强、群众文化较高、人口集中、地势平坦，办好几个典型，也可能很快地发展起来。就合作社的规模大小来说，一般地讲，应当由小而大，大社办起来是困难的；但是也不一定任何时候任何地方都是非先办小社不可。总之领导方面要注意吸取、总结群众的经验，不可主观主义地用一个规格到处去套。积累公共财产、生产投资、分红比例等等问题也是一样，都要依照当时当地群众觉悟程度、生产发展的实际需要等等情形来判断怎样算是多了，怎样算是少了。如果要找出一条不变的原则，那就是：既保证社会主义成分逐步地不断地增长，又保证每个社员实际利益能够逐年不断地增加。
    经过总路线的初步的宣传教育和爱国售粮运动，各地农民群众走社会主义道路的热情一般地说是高涨的。各地各级党委要十分珍视群众的热情，积极领导，稳步前进，将原有的一万四千多个社，根据具体条件适当地加以整顿、扩大，使新办的三万多个社要尽可能每一个都办好，争取全部实现一九五四年发展农业生产合作社的计划。
