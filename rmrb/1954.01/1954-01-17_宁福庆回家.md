    Ning Fuqing Returns Home
    Li Ming

    November 22, 1953.
    The Beijing-Shanghai train sped southward. Soldier Ning Fuqing excitedly watched the scenery outside the window: cities, villages, and fields. When he saw groups of villagers driving carts and pushing wheelbarrows, the carts loaded with bulging sacks, he pondered, "What's in those sacks?" Suddenly, he saw a small red triangular flag stuck on a wheelbarrow. He looked closely and saw the words "Sell Surplus Grain to the State!" written on it. His face immediately lit up. The instructor's speech before he left about the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period of the state reappeared in his mind. He thought: If I get home in time for this movement, I must mobilize my family to sell all our surplus grain to the state.
    When Ning Fuqing returned to Jinjialing Village in Cuyang County, Shandong Province, it was already dusk. He stayed at his second elder brother Ning Fusheng's house. When the village heard that Fuqing had returned from Beijing, many people came to see him, asking about the construction of the capital and life in the army. The next day, from dawn until late at night, people kept coming in an endless stream, keeping him busy. At this time, the village had not yet begun to publicize the mobilization of farmers to sell surplus grain to the state, so he did not publicize the state's grain policy to everyone. On the third morning, the village group leader notified Ning Fuqing's family to attend a village meeting. When people told him that the meeting was to mobilize the sale of surplus grain to the state, he wanted to immediately find his two elder brothers to ask them how much surplus grain they were planning to sell to the state, but at that moment, a group of young men pushed him to the meeting place.
      After the comrades from the township government explained in detail the benefits of selling surplus grain to the state, Ning Fuqing couldn't sit still. He felt as if many eyes were staring at him, staring at his entire family. He stood up and walked onto the stage.
    "Fellow villagers!" This was the first time he had spoken in front of so many of his own people, so his heart was pounding when he started speaking, but the strong sense of responsibility of a revolutionary soldier quickly calmed him down. He continued:
  "Did we have surplus grain in the past? It wasn't us who had surplus grain, but the landlords who drank our blood and ate our flesh. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to divide the land and stand up, and lent us seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools, so we could have surplus grain and a good life. Now our country is transitioning to socialism, and our lives will be even better in socialism. Selling our surplus grain to the state is helping the state transition to socialism faster. I guarantee to everyone that I will sell all my existing grain to the state!" He walked off the stage to the applause and cheers of the crowd. While listening to people's enthusiastic speeches supporting the state's grain policy, he kept glancing at his two elder brothers, anxiously muttering to himself, "Why haven't you signed up yet!" At that moment, the chairman announced that the meeting was temporarily adjourned.
    After the meeting, Ning Fuqing hurried to his eldest brother Ning Yantang's house. His eldest brother calculated for him: the two mu of land he had been allotted when the family was divided had been cultivated by the village on his behalf. In the past three years, after paying public grain, he should have had 500 jin of grain saved. Now, there was actually only 140 jin, and his eldest brother had used 360 jin. After discussion, Ning Fuqing decided to sell all the existing 140 jin of grain to the state, and the grain used by his eldest brother would be converted into cash and deposited in the cooperative to develop production.
    After settling the accounts, Ning Fuqing asked his eldest brother how much surplus grain he planned to sell. When he heard his eldest brother say that he only planned to sell 50 jin, he shook his head and asked in surprise, "Why only sell 50 jin?"
    "What if the harvest is bad after selling it all?" his eldest brother said worriedly.
      "How did you get through it when the harvest was so bad right after liberation?"
    "The government provided relief!"
    "That's right! Is there anything the People's Government doesn't do for our people? Isn't every policy designed to make our lives better and richer?!" Then, Ning Fuqing explained the general line of the state during the transition period again... Finally, he calculated for his eldest brother, "Keeping the surplus grain at home won't produce more grain, but selling it to the state can help the state build machines for us to cultivate the land sooner, production can increase, and life will be better."
    His eldest brother pondered for a long time, then suddenly said firmly, "I get it! I'll sell all my 200 jin of surplus grain to the state and resolutely follow Chairman Mao on the road to socialism!"
    After persuading his eldest brother, Ning Fuqing went to find his second elder brother. His second elder brother was a demobilized soldier. Although his life was more difficult than his eldest brother's, he immediately told Fuqing that he would sell all his 150 jin of surplus grain to the state. In the evening, he went to the home of his neighbor, Granny Jin. He told Granny Jin about his plan to sell grain and that his eldest and second elder brothers had also decided to sell their surplus grain to the state. Then, he patiently explained the reasoning to Granny Jin and answered the questions she raised, until Granny Jin said with a smile, "Don't worry, child, I'll sell all my 300 jin of surplus grain to the state, so that the profiteers won't even see a grain of rice!" Only then did he happily return home.
    The next day, the village meeting began again. Ning Fuqing was the first to report his grain sales plan. As he walked off the stage to the applause that resounded throughout the hall, he saw his second elder brother raising his fist in the front of the meeting place, and Granny Jin also raised her fist. One after another, farmers announced their grain sales plans. In the morning meeting alone, 30 households in Jinjialing, with fewer than 70 households, announced their grain sales plans.
    Ning Fuqing's vacation was over, and the men and women, young and old, of the village came to see him off. As the train was about to depart, the chairman of the village people's representative council tightly grasped his hand and said, "Fuqing, you have helped us a lot with our work at home. I thank you on behalf of all the village cadres." Ning Fuqing replied simply, "Realizing socialism is our common task."
    Soldier Ning Fuqing returned to his unit with the happy feeling of having done his part to realize socialism.

    宁福庆回家
    利铭
    一九五三年十一月二十二日。
    京沪列车向南急驰，战士宁福庆兴奋地望着车窗以外的景色：城市，乡村，原野。当他看到成群结队的老乡赶着大车、推着小车、车子上绑着凸凸的麻袋时，他沉思起来：“都装的什么呢？”突然，看到一辆小车上插着一面鲜红的三角小旗，他仔细一看，上面写着“把余粮卖给国家！”七个字，他的脸色一下开朗起来，动身以前指导员关于国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务的讲话又在他的脑海里出现了。他想：这次回家，如果赶上这个运动的话，一定要动员家里把全部余粮卖给国家。
    宁福庆回到山东省徂阳县金家岭村时，天已擦黑，他就住在二哥宁福盛的家里。村里听说福庆从北京回来了，很多人都来看他，问首都的建设，问部队的生活，第二天从天不亮到深夜，来的人总是川流不息，真是应接不暇。这时村里关于动员农民把余粮卖给国家的宣传还没有开始，所以他也就没有向大家宣传国家的粮食政策。第三天上午，村民小组长通知宁福庆家开村民大会。当人们告诉他开会是动员把余粮卖给国家时，他想马上去找他两个哥哥问一问他们准备卖多少余粮给国家，可是就在这时，一群小伙子却把他前呼后拥地推到了会场。
      乡政府的同志详细地向大家讲了把余粮卖给国家的好处之后，宁福庆便坐不住了。他感到似乎像有很多人的眼睛都在盯着他、盯着他的全家。他站起来走上讲台。
    “父老们！”这是他第一次在这样多的自己父老面前讲话，因此一开口心还跳得慌，但是革命军人高度的责任感使他很快平静了下来。他接着说：
  “我们过去那年有过余粮？有余粮的不是我们，而是那些喝我们血、吃我们肉的地主。共产党、毛主席领导我们分了地翻了身，又贷给我们种子、肥料和农具，我们这才有了余粮，有了好日子过。现在我们国家正在向社会主义过渡，到了社会主义我们的日子就会过得更好。我们把余粮卖给国家，就是帮助国家更快地过渡到社会主义。我向大家保证，我把我现有的粮食全卖给国家！”他在群众的掌声和欢呼声中走下讲话台。他一面听着人们热烈拥护国家粮食政策的发言，一面不断地瞅瞅他的两个哥哥，心里着急的自语着：“你们怎么还不报名啊！”就在这时，主席宣布会议暂时结束。
    散会后，宁福庆匆匆走到他大哥宁衍堂家里，他大哥给他算了一下账：他分家时分的二亩地，一直由村中代耕，三年来除了缴纳公粮等，应存他的粮食五百斤，现在实有粮食一百四十斤，大哥用去了三百六十斤。经过商议，宁福庆决定把现有的一百四十斤粮食全部卖给国家，大哥用去的粮食折合成现款存入合作社发展生产。
    算完了账，宁福庆又问大哥准备卖多少余粮，当他听大哥说只准备卖五十斤时，他摇摇头惊奇地问：“为什么只卖五十斤？”
    “都卖了赶上年成不好怎么办？”大哥有顾虑地说。
      “刚解放时年成多不好，你怎么过来的？”
    “政府救济嘛！”
    “是啊！人民政府那一点不为咱人民着想。那一项政策不是为了使我们的生活过得更好、更富裕？！”接着，宁福庆又把国家过渡时期的总路线解释了一遍……最后他给大哥算了一笔账：“你把余粮放在家里也不会生出更多粮食来，可是卖给国家，就可以帮助国家早一天给我们造出种地的机器，生产就可以增加；生活也就会更好了。”
    大哥沉思了好大会，突然坚定地说：“通啦！把我的二百斤余粮全卖给国家，坚决跟着毛主席走社会主义的路！”
    宁福庆说服了大哥又去找二哥。二哥是复员军人，虽然生活比大哥困难，可是他立即向福庆表示，把一百五十斤余粮全卖给国家。晚上他又到了邻居金大娘的家里，他把他的卖粮计划和他大哥二哥也决定把余粮卖给国家的事告诉了金大娘，然后又耐心地给金大娘讲道理，解答金大娘提出的问题，直到金大娘眉开眼笑地说：“放心吧孩子，我把三百斤余粮也全卖给国家，叫奸商连一粒粮食影子也看不到！”他才高兴地回到家里。
    第二天，村民大会又开始了，宁福庆第一个报告了他的卖粮计划。当他在响彻全场的掌声中走下讲台的时候，他看到在会场的前面，他二哥举起了拳头，金大娘也举起了拳头。宣布卖粮计划的农民一个接着一个，仅在上午的会上，不足七十户人家的金家岭就有三十户公布了自己的卖粮计划。
    宁福庆的假期满了，村中男女老少都来为他送行。火车要开动时，村人民代表主席紧握着他的手说：“福庆，你回家帮我们作了许多工作，我代表全村干部感谢你。”宁福庆却干脆的回答说：“实现社会主义，这是我们共同的任务。”
    战士宁福庆怀着为实现社会主义而尽了自己的一点力量的愉快心情，回到了部队。
