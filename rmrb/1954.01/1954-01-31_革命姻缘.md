　　Revolutionary Marriage
　　Zhao Zhongxin
　　Jiang Fuzhen, the young, enthusiastic, and straightforward female township head of Lijia Township, Dazhu County, Sichuan Province, has been doing two things lately that people find hard to understand. One is: she always has a small red package beside her, wrapped very tightly, and she often gazes at it thoughtfully. No one knows what’s inside. If it’s a gift for the volunteers, she's already been visiting the volunteer troops on the east coast for over a month, so why does she still keep it? If it’s something she uses herself, why has no one ever seen her open it?
　　The other is: every time she finishes a report to the companies, the soldiers compete to ask her for photos as souvenirs. At first, Jiang Fuzhen would give them out whenever the soldiers asked, but when she only had three of her fifty photos left, no matter how much the soldiers asked, she refused to give them any more. What could be the reason for this?
　　Perhaps she has someone even closer to her in the Volunteer Army! However, the delegation conducted three rounds of registration, investigating who had relatives in the Volunteer Army, and Jiang Fuzhen always wrote the same two words each time: "None." Thus, these two matters became even more of a mystery.
　　One day, the mystery was finally solved. A female comrade who was with Jiang Fuzhen discovered the words "Volunteer Army ××× unit Peng Licheng" written in Jiang Fuzhen's diary. The female comrade immediately pointed to the name and asked Jiang Fuzhen, who then blushed and told her that Peng Licheng was her fiancé to whom she had been engaged for seven years. The reason she hadn't mentioned it all along was that she was embarrassed to add to the leadership's trouble with such a personal matter. As a result, the matter immediately spread throughout the delegation.
　　On November 10th, a certain unit of the Volunteer Army stationed on the west coast suddenly received a telegram from headquarters: it ordered soldier Peng Licheng of that unit to immediately go to the third sub-group of the third delegation to Korea on the east coast to meet his fiancée Jiang Fuzhen. That day, Peng Licheng, who was studying culture on Qingshan Ridge, set off eastward with cultural instructor Yang Shengrong in a brand-new jeep.
　　On the evening of November 12th, Jiang Fuzhen had just returned from visiting the companies when she heard someone shouting from afar, "Jiang Fuzhen, come quickly! Your relative Peng Licheng has come to see you from the west coast!" At that moment, Jiang Fuzhen was both surprised and delighted. "Is this true? What wonderful method did Vice Chairman Yan (Yan Hongyan, chairman of the third sub-group, vice-chairman of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government) come up with to find him!" She thought as her heart pounded, and she hurried towards the street. At this time, the streets of the plateau were bustling with activity. More than a dozen Volunteer Army soldiers were lined up neatly, with Peng Licheng also standing in the line, as if preparing to receive a review. A large group of people surrounded them. As soon as they heard that Jiang Fuzhen had arrived, a teasing young soldier shouted, "Jiang Fuzhen, please pick out your fiancé from this line of people!" This really embarrassed Jiang Fuzhen. How could she find him? When she was thirteen years old, her parents had arranged her engagement to Peng Licheng, but they had never met or exchanged photos, so how could she recognize him? Jiang Fuzhen hesitated, and several female comrades pulled her to the front of the line to look him over, but Jiang Fuzhen could only say with a flushed face, "I can't find him!" This statement caused everyone present to burst into laughter.
　　In the end, it was cultural instructor Yang Shengrong who pulled the blushing Peng Licheng out of the line and introduced him to Jiang Fuzhen, saying, "This is the young soldier beloved by everyone in our guard company, a people's meritorious worker who has been commended three times for his achievements in combat, digging tunnels, and studying. This is Comrade Peng Licheng, a relative of Comrade Jiang Fuzhen. Please shake hands quickly!"
　　What an extraordinary meeting! For more than three years, how they had longed for this day! Peng Licheng, in Korea, whenever he thought of the motherland, of his hometown, whenever he saw his comrades receiving letters from their wives, he thought of Jiang Fuzhen. He thought: this daughter of a poor peasant, she should be emancipated by now! Perhaps she has joined a mutual aid group, enrolled in a literacy class, and perhaps she has even joined the Communist Youth League and become a cadre! If she still has me in her heart, if she could be like Gao Guizhen, the fiancée of Dong Shigui, how happy that would be! However, when he thought of the New Marriage Law, of the fact that this marriage was arranged by his parents, he doubted his beautiful imaginings: perhaps she is not satisfied with this marriage; so he made another mental preparation: as long as the other party proposes to break off the engagement, he would unconditionally agree.
　　What was Jiang Fuzhen thinking? Ever since she learned that Peng Licheng had become a volunteer soldier, she felt honored from the bottom of her heart. Especially while promoting the New Marriage Law, she had repeatedly considered her own marriage. She thought: although our marriage was arranged by our parents, times have changed! She is a Communist Party member, a revolutionary cadre, and Peng Licheng is the most beloved person protecting the motherland in Korea. If they cultivate revolutionary feelings, wouldn't it be natural to form a happy marriage?
　　Therefore, although they had never met, although Jiang Fuzhen had written five letters to Peng Licheng, none of which Peng Licheng had received, the revolutionary enthusiasm and pure love made their hearts connect, and encouraged them to constantly move forward! When Peng Licheng repeatedly completed communication tasks on the front lines in Korea under enemy fire in October 1951, earning a third-class merit, Jiang Fuzhen also achieved a bumper harvest of 800 jin of rice per mu on the production front and was awarded the honorary title of women's labor model in the county in November of the same year. When Peng Licheng created a new record for digging tunnels while building the underground Great Wall in October 1952, earning another third-class merit, Jiang Fuzhen also made great progress in leading the masses to develop mutual aid and cooperation and joined the Communist Party of China in December of the same year. When Jiang Fuzhen was elected as the head of Lijia Township by the masses in June 1953, Peng Licheng became a sharpshooter with perfect accuracy in training in July, and his name appeared on the list of meritorious workers for the third time.
　　This day finally arrived. On the night of their meeting, she took out her photo, opened the small red package containing a pair of cloth shoes with five plum blossoms embroidered on the thousand-layer soles, handed them to Peng Licheng, and said, "Try them on and see if they fit. I didn't have a shoe pattern, so I made these based on what I imagined in my heart." Peng Licheng took this precious gift with both hands, his eyes sparkling with grateful tears, and quickly pinned one of his military medals on Jiang Fuzhen's chest.
　　The meeting was naturally pleasant and happy. Someone suggested that they get married, but they refused. They each had their own thoughts. Peng Licheng thought: the enemy is not reconciled and may provoke war again. He is a soldier and must be prepared for battle at any time. Moreover, he is still very young and has contributed very little to the motherland, so he should not be greedy for personal happiness. As for Jiang Fuzhen! She thought that she was representing the people of the motherland to express her regards to the volunteer soldiers and the Korean people, and she should not be busy solving personal problems. Moreover, they had waited so many years, now that they had met and could communicate, couldn't they wait a little longer?
　　Later, due to the persuasion of the delegation and the Volunteer Army leaders, who wanted them to see their union as one of the crystallizations of hard work in the revolutionary struggle, the young couple agreed. On December 12th, Jiang Fuzhen and Peng Licheng were married at the Volunteer Army garrison on the west coast. Many people came to congratulate them on their happy union. The new room was covered with red and green couplets. One couplet was particularly eye-catching, reading: "Happy to see relatives on the Korean front, Heroic models get married on Qingshan Ridge," with the horizontal scroll reading: "Revolutionary Marriage."

　　革命姻缘
　　赵忠信
    蒋富珍，这个年轻、热情而又直爽的四川省大竹县李家乡的女乡长，这些天有两件事的确使大家不能理解。一件是：在她的身边有一个红色的小包裹，一层一层包的真叫严实，她常常望着它若有所思，里面包的什么东西，谁也不知道。要说是她赠给志愿军的礼物吧，她到东海岸的志愿军部队进行慰问已经一个多月了，为什么它还老放着呢？要说是她自己用的物品吧，为什么从来没见她打开过呢？
    再一件是：她每次到连队报告完了，战士们都争着向她要照片留念。起初，只要战士们要，蒋富珍就给，但当她的五十张照片赠送的只剩下三张的时候，战士们怎样要求，她也不肯往外拿了。这又是什么缘故呢？
    也许在志愿军中还有她更亲近的人儿吧！可是慰问团进行了三次登记，调查谁在志愿军中有什么亲属，蒋富珍每次填的都是两个字：“没有”。因而这两件事，就越发成了个谜了。
    这一天，谜终于破了。和蒋富珍一起的一位女同志发现在蒋富珍的日记本上写着“志愿军×××部彭立成”等字样。这位女同志马上指着名字问蒋富珍，蒋富珍这才绯红着脸告诉了她，这个彭立成就是她订婚七年的未婚夫，她所以一直未讲，就是不好意思为这点子个人小事去增加领导上的麻烦。于是这件事就立即在慰问团里传开了。
    十一月十日，驻在西海岸的志愿军某部忽然收到了总部发来的一份电报：要该部战士彭立成立即到东海岸第三届赴朝慰问团第三总分团会见他的未婚妻蒋富珍。当天，正在青山岭上学习文化的彭立成便和文化教员杨胜荣乘着一辆崭新的小吉普向东出发了。
    十一月十二日黄昏，蒋富珍刚刚从连队里进行慰问回来，就听见远远地有人在喊她：“蒋富珍，快来呀！你的亲人彭立成从西海岸来看你来啦！”当时蒋富珍真是又惊又喜。“这是真的吗？阎副主席（第三总分团团长，四川省人民政府副主席阎红彦）想了个啥妙法子，竟把他找来了呢！”她一边在想，一边心在跳，就匆匆向街上跑来了。这时高原里街头上正闹嚷嚷的，十几个志愿军战士整整齐齐地排成一列，让彭立成也站在队里，好象准备接受检阅一样，一大群人围着他们。一听说蒋富珍来了，一个爱逗的年轻战士就喊起来：“蒋富珍，请你在这队人当中，挑你的未婚夫吧！”这下可真叫蒋富珍有点难为情了。她怎会找到呢？还在她十三岁的时候，就由父母做主和彭立成订了婚，她们既未见过面，又未交换过相片，怎样能认出来呢？蒋富珍正迟迟不前，几个女同志就拉她到队前认了一遍，蒋富珍只好涨红着脸说：“我找不到啊！”这一说，可把在场的人引得哄堂大笑起来。
    结果，还是文化教员扬胜荣把羞得满脸通红的彭立成从队里拉出来，给蒋富珍介绍说：“这就是我们警卫连人人热爱的青年战士，在战斗、挖坑道和学习中，三次立功的人民功臣，蒋富珍同志的亲人彭立成同志。请赶快握手吧！”
    这是多么不寻常的会见！三年多以来，他们是在如何渴望着这一天啊！彭立成，他在朝鲜，只要想起祖国，想起家乡，只要看到战友们接到妻子的来信，他就想起了蒋富珍。他想：这个贫农的女儿，现在也该翻身了吧！说不定她也参加了互助组，上了识字班，也说不定她已加入青年团成了干部了吧！要是她心里还有我，要是她能象董世贵的未婚妻高桂珍那样，那是多么幸福啊！但是，当他一想到新婚姻法，一想到这桩婚事是由父母包办的时候，他又对自己美好的想象发生了怀疑：也许，她并不满意这桩婚事；于是他又做了另一个精神准备：只要对方提出退婚，自己就无条件地答应。
    蒋富珍怎样想的呢？自从她知道彭立成当了志愿军，她从心底里感到自己光荣。尤其在宣传新婚姻法当中，她曾反复地考虑过自己的婚事。她想：我们俩的婚事虽然是父母做的主，可是眼下时代变了啊！自己是共产党员，是革命干部，彭立成是在朝鲜保卫祖国的最可爱的人，要是培养起革命感情，不是很自然地就结成了美满的婚姻吗？
    因此，尽管他们从未见面，尽管蒋富珍给彭立成写了五封信，彭立成都没有接到，可是那种革命的热情和纯真的爱情是如何使他们心心相印，如何鼓舞着他们不断前进啊！当一九五一年十月彭立成在朝鲜前线敌人炮火的封锁线上反复数次完成通讯任务立了三等功的时候，蒋富珍也在生产战线上争取了一亩产八百斤水稻的丰收，并于同年十一月获得了全县妇女劳动模范的光荣称号。当一九五二年十月彭立成在修筑地下长城中创造了打坑道新纪录，再次立了三等功的时候，蒋富珍又在带动群众发展互助合作中取得了很大成绩，并于同年十二月加入了中国共产党。当一九五三年六月蒋富珍被群众选为李家乡乡长的时候，七月间，彭立成又在练兵中成了百发百中的神枪手，他的名字第三次上了功臣榜。
    这一天终于来到了。在他们会面的当天晚上，她拿出了自己的照片，她打开了那个小红包裹里包着的一双千层底上纳着五朵梅花的布鞋，递给彭立成说：“你试试合适不合适吧，没有鞋样，这是我自己心里出的样子给你做的。”彭立成双手接过了这珍贵的礼品，眼里闪动着感激的泪花，并连忙把自己的一枚军功章，戴在蒋富珍的胸前。
    相会自然是愉快和幸福的，有人提议要他们结婚，被拒绝了。他们各有各的想法。彭立成想：敌人还不甘心，可能还要挑起战争，自己是个战士，随时都要准备战斗。况且，自己年纪还很轻，对祖国的贡献还很小，不应贪求个人的幸福。蒋富珍呢！她想，自己是代表祖国人民来慰问志愿军和朝鲜人民的，决不应该忙于解决个人的问题，况且，那么多年都等待下来了，现在见过面了，能通信了，还不能等待吗？
    后来，由于慰问团和志愿军首长的说服，要他们把自己的结合看成是革命斗争中艰苦奋斗的结晶之一，这对年轻人才同意了。十二月十二日，蒋富珍和彭立成在西海岸的志愿军驻地结婚了。很多人都来为他们这幸福的结合祝贺。新房里贴满了红红绿绿的对联，有一幅对联最引人注目，对联上写着：“朝鲜前线喜见亲人，青山岭上英模结婚”，横批是：“革命姻缘”。
