Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th – Lieutenant General Timayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, sent a letter to the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces on January 14. The full text of the original letter is as follows:

To the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces:

I have the honor to draw your attention to this Commission's letter No. 1 of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission/REP/ dated January 2, 1954, and your reply dated January 6, 1954.

1.  As mentioned in this Commission’s letter of January 2, 1954, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has so far been able to implement only to a limited extent those procedures stipulated in the "Terms of Reference."

2.  Among those non-repatriated prisoners of war under the custody of this Commission, some are unwilling to exercise their right to repatriation. A much larger number have been unable to use the procedures stipulated in the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules" formulated in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" concerning the exercise of their right to repatriation.

3.  The issue of the handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation must be submitted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to the Political Conference. Although this submission is mandatory, it has not been realized because the aforementioned Political Conference has not materialized. Furthermore, the interpretation procedures to which all prisoners of war are entitled under the "Terms of Reference" and which this Commission is charged with presiding over, have only been carried out for a small portion of all prisoners of war in custody.

4.  These and other failures in implementing the "Terms of Reference" are due to reasons and factors not caused by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force, and for which they bear no responsibility.

5.  Only if an agreement is reached between the two sides or with the two sides on the issue of extending the interpretation and custodial period, and on such alternative measures or extended procedures that are necessary due to the failure of the Political Conference to materialize, can this Commission further or more fully implement the procedures and purposes of the "Terms of Reference" from December 24, 1953.

6.  Regarding these issues, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has repeatedly made recommendations and requests to both sides. The reality of the situation faced by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has been finally detailed in its letter of January 2 and the memorandum attached to that letter.

7.  This Commission specifically raised four questions regarding matters of fundamental importance if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is to more fully implement the repatriation agreement, and requested your response to these questions.

8.  The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission received your response to each question. Your responses sought to "eliminate any possibility of doubt or misunderstanding regarding the views of the United Nations Command" and reiterated the "firm position" of the United Nations Command.

9.  The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission noted that the firm positions taken by the United Nations Command on each of the four questions are:

	(A)	Continued explanation is impossible;
	(B)	The United Nations Command’s opinion is that "it is extremely unlikely that the Political Conference will convene before January 22";
	(C)	The United Nations Command sees no reason to enter into any discussion to consider the handling of non-repatriated prisoners of war; and
	(D)	The Indian Custodial Force's authority to hold prisoners of war terminates at 00:01 hours on January 23, 1954.

10.	The above-mentioned answers, which demonstrate the United Nations Command's firm position, undoubtedly illustrate that the United Nations Command cannot agree to establish those conditions and measures that are of fundamental importance to the further implementation of the methods and purposes of the "Terms of Reference," and without these conditions and measures, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot seek further implementation of the methods and purposes of the "Terms of Reference."

11.	Therefore, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has to make its own decisions based on the current situation and its own understanding of the terms and purposes of the "Terms of Reference" and the resulting responsibilities and obligations.

12.	It was also noted in your reply of January 6, 1954, that you also raised the views of the United Nations Command that:

	(A)	The Political Conference "has no decisive relationship to the issue of prisoners of war under the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission";
	(B)	Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference" prevents your side from entering into any discussion to further consider the handling of prisoners of war;
	(C)	The claim raised in (B) above has been "clearly indicated in the armistice negotiations which resulted in the formulation of the 'Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission'";
	(D)	At 00:01 hours on January 23, 1954, "the Commission has a clear responsibility to release prisoners of war as civilians."

13.	The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has received answers from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who insist that:

	(A)	The explanation period should be extended and the explanations should be resumed;
	(B)	The issue of non-repatriated prisoners of war should be submitted to the Political Conference;
	(C)	The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force should continue to perform "their legitimate duties."

14.	The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission deems it necessary to explain its own position in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and its purposes, and to state its own views on the assertions described in paragraph 12 in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and its purposes:

	(A)	The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot agree with what you said in your reply that the Political Conference has no decisive relationship to the issue of prisoners of war. This Commission's view is that the Political Conference is an inseparable part of the methods and procedures contained in Article 11. The cancellation or non-realization of this inseparable part of this arrangement cannot be considered irrelevant, of only a slight impact, or of no impact on the remaining parts of this method or on the decisions regarding the identity and handling of prisoners of war that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is responsible for making;
	(B)	The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot agree that the provisions of Article 11 preclude further discussions between the two sides on matters related to the purposes of this agreement. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has sought to reach agreements with one side or with both sides in various different circumstances, and has not recognized such discussions held with or between the two sides for the purpose of implementing the "Terms of Reference" and its purposes as being precluded. It should also be reminded that the date of the temporary supplementary agreement in the second annex of the "Armistice Agreement" is July 27, 1953, which is after the signing of the first annex, the "Terms of Reference," on June 8, 1953;
	(C)	The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was not a party to the armistice negotiations and is unaware of the representations made to each other by the two sides in the negotiations mentioned in your reply;
	(D)	The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot agree that it has a clear responsibility to release prisoners of war as civilians. The "Terms of Reference" does not stipulate such a release. However, the "Terms of Reference" stipulates that after implementing certain methods stipulated therein, the Commission should "declare their release from prisoner-of-war status to civilian status." However, these methods have not been implemented, thus rendering the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission unqualified even to "declare" such a "release."

15.	The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has deeply and with concern considered the issue of the identity and handling of the prisoners of war in its custody in the current situation and has made the following decisions:

	(A)	The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has no right to release prisoners of war; the "Terms of Reference" does not stipulate or contemplate such an ending;
	(B)	The "Terms of Reference" did not delegate the final handling of prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and only the final handling includes release;
	(C)	The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission currently has no right to "declare" the "release" of prisoners of war under its custody to civilian status because the methods that should be implemented before this declaration have not been implemented;
	(D)	Due to the absence of an agreement between the relevant parties, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot continue to hold or perform any duties after January 23, 1954, to promote the implementation of the "Terms of Reference."

16.	Based on the above decisions, I, as the Chairman and Executor of this Commission and still in custody of the prisoners of war, have reached the conclusion that the only feasible, correct, lawful, and peaceful path is to hand the prisoners of war back to the respective detaining parties for custody shortly before January 23, 1954.

17.	Therefore, I propose to request you to accept the resumption of custody at 09:00 hours on January 20, 1954, and hope to complete this matter as soon as possible.

18.	The handover of custodial work will be held on the southern edge of the demilitarized zone and on the perimeter of the Indian Custodial Force, and in accordance with existing procedures for the transfer of prisoners of war, the prisoners of war will be accepted on your side's edge.

19.	As the Chairman and Executor of this Commission, I wish to state in the clearest possible manner that when handing the prisoners of war back to the custody of the original detaining party, I am doing so because I can neither maintain custody of the prisoners of war, nor further implement the "Terms of Reference," nor release them. I am doing so not to make any changes to their identity, or to carry out the final handling of the prisoners of war.

20.	Furthermore, in accordance with this Commission's function and authority to interpret the "Terms of Reference," this Commission believes that changing the identity of prisoners of war by declaring civilian status or by any other means of handling requires prior implementation of the procedures for explanation and the Political Conference to be decided; this method should be carried out to a lawful conclusion in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned authority (scope), unless the two sides have agreed on other procedures or practices for the identity and handling of prisoners of war. Any unilateral action by any relevant party would be inconsistent with the aforementioned "Terms of Reference."

21.	This Commission is taking this approach because it sincerely desires to promote the purposes of the Armistice Agreement, to adhere to lawful and impartial methods in the current situation, to avoid the possible outbreak of violence, and to act in accordance with the purposes and spirit of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.

22.	I would like to venture to express my confident hope that both sides will also be motivated by the same desire when taking further steps regarding the identity and handling of the prisoners of war who are about to be handed back to their respective custody.

23.	I express my gratitude to the United Nations forces for their reassurance of their readiness to assist this Commission until its dissolution, and I would like to assure them that this Commission has striven to objectively and to the best of its ability fulfill its obligations. I would be grateful if you could provide this Commission with a response before January 16, 1954.

### 蒂迈雅一月十四日给联合国军总司令的信

    蒂迈雅一月十四日给联合国军总司令的信
    【新华社开城十九日电】中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将在一月十四日致函联合国军总司令。原函全文如下：致联合国军总司令
    我荣幸地提请查照本委员会一九五四年一月二日中立国遣返委员会／REP／第一号函与你一九五四年一月六日的答复。
    一、像本委员会一九五四年一月二日函内所提到的，中立国遣返委员会迄今只能有限度地实施“职权范围”中所规定的那些程序。
    二、在本委员会看管下那些未遣返的战俘中有些战俘不愿行使其遣返权利。尚有为数多得多的那些人则未能使用“职权范围”与根据“职权范围”制定的“细则”中规定的有关战俘行使其遣返权利的那些程序。
    三、未行使遣返权利的战俘的处理问题必须由中立国遣返委员会提交政治会议。虽然这一提交是有强制性的，但是由于上述政治会议尚未实现，这一提交还没有实现。还有，所有战俘按照“职权范围”都有权利享有的与本委员会被责成主持的那些解释程序，只是对在看管下的全体战俘中的一小部分执行过。
    四、关于在实施“职权范围”上的这些和其他的失败，是由于并非中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队所造成的，而且它们对之不负任何责任的那些原因和因素所致。
    五、只有在双方之间或与双方在延长解释与看管时间问题上、以及由于政治会议未能实现而必需作出的这种变通办法或延长程序问题上达成协议，本委员会才可能自一九五三年十二月二十四日起进一步或更充分地实施“职权范围”的程序及目的。
    六、关于这些问题，中立国遣返委员会曾一再向双方提出建议和要求。中立国遣返委员会所面临情况之实情，最后已详述在其一月二日函及随该函附上的备忘录中。
    七、本委员会就中立国遣返委员会如要更充分地实施遣返协议时有基本意义的事情特别提出了四个问题，并要求你对这些问题给予答复。
    八、中立国遣返委员会荣获你对每一个问题的答复。你的答复要想“消除对于联合国军司令部的看法发生任何怀疑或误解的可能”，并重述了联合国军司令部的“坚决立场”。
    九、中立国遣返委员会注意到联合国军司令部对各该四问题所采取的坚决立场是：
    （甲）继续解释是不可能的；
    （乙）联合国军司令部的意见是“政治会议极不可能于一月二十二日前开会”；
    （丙）联合国军司令部觉得没有理由进入任何讨论以考虑未遣返战俘的处理问题；并且
    （丁）印度看管部队看管战俘的职权于一九五四年一月二十三日零时一分终止。
    十、上面的表明联合国军司令部坚决立场的回答无可置疑地说明了联合国军司令部不能同意建立那些对进一步实施“职权范围”的办法与目的有基本意义的条件与办法，而没有这些条件与办法，中立国遣返委员会是不能寻求进一步实施“职权范围”的办法与目的的。
    十一、因此，中立国遣返委员会就不得不依据现时存在的情况，以及其本身对“职权范围”的条款与目的与由此而产生的责任与义务的了解，作出自己的决定。
    十二、也注意到了在你一九五四年一月六日的回答中，你还提出了联合国军司令部方面的看法：
      （甲）政治会议“与在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘问题并没有决定性的关系”；
      （乙）“职权范围”第十一款使你方不能进入任何讨论以进一步考虑战俘处理问题；
      （丙）上面（乙）项中提出的主张已“在结果制定了‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’的停战谈判中清楚地指明了。”；
      （丁）在一九五四年一月二十三日零时一分的时候，“委员会有明确的责任释放战俘为平民”。
    十三、中立国遣返委员会已从朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面得到他们的回答，他们坚持：
      （甲）解释期限应予延长，解释应予恢复；
      （乙）未遣返的战俘的问题应提交政治会议；
      （丙）中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队应继续执行“其合法职务”。
    十四、中立国遣返委员会认为有必要根据“职权范围”与其目的说明自己的立场，并根据“职权范围”与其目的对于第十二段中所述断言说明它自己的看法：
      （甲）中立国遣返委员会不能同意如你复信中所说的政治会议对战俘问题并没有决定性的关系。本委员会的看法是政治会议乃是载在第十一款中之方式与程序的不可分的一部分。此种安排中之不可分的一部分之取消或未实现，不能认为对本办法的其余部分或对中立国遣返委员会有责任要作出的关于战俘的身份与处理的决议无关或只有微小影响或没有影响；
      （乙）中立国遣返委员会不能同意第十一款之各项规定排除双方之间对有关这一协议的目的的事项作进一步的讨论。中立国遣返委员会在各种不同情况下寻求与一方或与双方达成协议，而并未将此种为实施“职权范围”及其目的而与双方的或双方之间举行的讨论认作是受到排除的。也要提醒一点是：“停战协定”的第二个附件临时补充协议的日期是一九五三年七月二十七日，是在一九五三年六月八日签订了第一个附件“职权范围”之后的；
      （丙）中立国遣返委员会并非停战谈判的一方，并不知道你在你复信中所提到的双方在谈判中对彼此所作的表示；
      （丁）中立国遣返委员会不能同意说它有释放战俘为平民的明白责任。“职权范围”没有规定这种释放。但“职权范围”规定：在实施了其中规定的某些办法之后委员会应“宣布解除他们的战俘身份使之成为平民”。可是这些办法并未能实施，从而使得中立国遣返委员会即使连“宣布”这种“解除”的资格也没有。
    十五、中立国遣返委员会已深入地与关切地考虑了在目前情况下它所看管的战俘的身份和处理的问题，并作出了以下决定：
    （甲）中立国遣返委员会无权释放战俘；“职权范围”没有规定或想到这样的终局；
    （乙）“职权范围”并未将对战俘的最后处理委派给中立国遣返委员会，而只有最后处理才包括释放；
    （丙）中立国遣返委员会目前无权对在其看管下的战俘“宣布”“解除”战俘身份使之成为平民，因为规定在这一宣布以前应实施的办法未曾实施；
      （丁）由于有关双方之间没有协议，因而中立国遣返委员会不能在一九五四年一月二十三日以后继续看管或执行任何职务以促进“职权范围”的实施。
    十六、根据以上的决定，我作为本委员会的主席与执行人并又在看管战俘，就达到了这一个结论，即：唯一可行的正确合法以及和平的道路是紧接着在一九五四年一月二十三日以前不久把战俘交还原拘留各方看管。
    十七、因此我提议要求你接受在一九五四年一月二十日九时恢复看管，并希望能将这件事尽快完成。
    十八、看管工作的交还将在非军事区南部的边缘以及印度看管部队的周界上举行，并根据战俘的移交既有程序，战俘将在你方的边缘被接受。
    十九、作为本委员会的主席与执行人我愿以最明确的方式声明：在把战俘交还原拘留一方看管的时候，我这么做是因为我既不能保持对战俘的看管，又不能进一步实施“职权范围”，也不能把他们释放。我这么做并不是要使他们的身份有任何改变，或者要进行对战俘的最后处理。
    二十、此外，遵照本委员会解释“职权范围”的职司与权力，本委员会认为：用宣布具有平民身份或者用任何其他方式的处理来改变战俘的身份，都需要在此之前实施关于解释和政治会议的程序来加以决定；这种办法应根据上述职权（范围）的规定进行到合法的终局，除非双方对于战俘身份与处理商定了其他程序或做法。任何有关方面的任何片面行动将不符合于上述“职权范围”。
    二十一、本委员会采取这一做法是由于它诚挚地愿望推进停战协定的目的，按现时存在的情况，遵守合法的不偏不倚的办法，避免暴力的可能爆发，并依照关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约的目的与精神行事。
    二十二、我愿冒昧表示有信心的希望，即双方对于即将交还给他们各自去看管的战俘的身份与处理进一步采取步骤时，也将出于相同的愿望。
    二十三、我对联合国军重新保证准备直到本委员会解散时都协助本委员会，表示感激，并愿向他们保证：本委员会已努力客观地并尽其力之所及以履行其义务。如果你在一九五四年一月十六日以前能对本委员会予以答复，我将不胜感激。
        中立国遣返委员会主席　蒂迈雅中将
                      一九五四年一月十四日
