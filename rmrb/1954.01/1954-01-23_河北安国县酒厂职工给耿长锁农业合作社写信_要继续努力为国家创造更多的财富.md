Letter from Employees of An Guo County Distillery, Hebei Province, to Geng Changsuo Agricultural Cooperative
Continue to Work Hard to Create More Wealth for the Country

Dear Comrade Geng Changsuo and all members of the cooperative:

On New Year's Day 1954, all of us employees listened to Comrade Geng Changsuo's broadcast and learned that under the leadership of the Party and the government, you have organized yourselves to develop production and gradually improve your lives. Your sale of over 160,000 jin of surplus grain and oil to the state is an act of patriotism that has inspired our production enthusiasm and strengthened our confidence in building a socialist society together with our farmer brothers.

After studying the General Line, we have become even more clear that only through the solid unity of the working class and the broad masses of peasants, and by doing a good job in industrial and agricultural production, can a beautiful socialist society arrive sooner. Last year, we launched an increase production and practice economy campaign, actively seeking methods and tricks to increase output and reduce costs, and overfulfilled the glorious task assigned to us by the higher authorities. In terms of conservation: in the fourth quarter, we used dried yam instead of grain to make wine, ensuring quality and saving more than 990,000 jin of grain. We used wheat bran, black flour, and waste distiller's grains to make distiller's yeast, saving more than 270,000 jin of wheat. We also taught workers in other distilleries in the province to use dried yam to make wine, greatly saving grain. Now, we are continuing our efforts to complete the new tasks for 1954 and strive to create more wealth for the country.

Dear Comrade Geng Changsuo and all members of the cooperative, every time we eat, we think of you and all the peasants. The more we think, the happier we become, and the more energetic we become in our work. Although our products are consumer goods, they are needed by the people. Therefore, we must work hard to produce and supply your needs and the needs of all our farmer brothers. We also hope that you will do a good job in winter production and sideline production, accumulate more fertilizer, and prepare for spring plowing.

Comrades, let us work together! Victory has brought us happiness, and victory has pointed out a beautiful vision for us! We will go from victory to victory!

		All Employees of An Guo County Distillery, Hebei Province

    河北安国县酒厂职工给耿长锁农业合作社写信
    要继续努力为国家创造更多的财富亲爱的耿长锁同志及全体社员同志们：
    一九五四年元旦，我们全体职工听到了耿长锁同志的广播，知道你们在党和政府的领导下，组织起来发展了生产，逐渐改善了生活。你们把十六万斤余粮和油料卖给国家，这种爱国行动，鼓舞了我们的生产热情，坚定了我们和农民兄弟共同建设社会主义社会的信心。
    我们学习了总路线后，更加明确了只有工人阶级和广大农民巩固地团结起来，搞好工农业生产，美好的社会主义社会才会早日到来。去年，我们展开了增产节约竞赛，积极想办法、找窍门，提高产量，降低成本，超额完成了上级交给我们的光荣任务。在节约方面：我们在第四季度用山药干代替粮食制酒，保证了质量，节省了九十九万多斤粮食。用麸皮、黑面和废酒糟造曲，节省了二十七万多斤小麦。我们还教会了全省其他酒厂的工人，也用山药干制酒，大大节省了粮食。现在，我们正继续努力，为完成一九五四年新的任务，给国家创造更多的财富而努力。
    亲爱的耿长锁同志及全体社员同志们，每当我们吃饭的时候，就想起了你们和全体农民，我们越想越欢喜，干起活来越有劲。我们的产品虽然是消费品，但它是人民所需要的。因此我们要努力生产，供给你们和全体农民兄弟的生活需要。我们也希望你们要搞好冬季生产和副业生产，多积肥，作好春耕前的准备工作。
    同志们，让我们共同努力吧！胜利给我们带来了幸福，胜利给我们指出了美丽的远景！我们要从胜利走向胜利！
                河北省安国县酒厂全体职工
