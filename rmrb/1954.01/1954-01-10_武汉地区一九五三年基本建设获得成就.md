In 1953, the Wuhan area achieved many accomplishments in basic construction. The Han River Railway Bridge project, an important component of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction, commenced last year. Once this bridge is completed, trains on the Beijing-Hankou Railway will be able to directly reach Hanyang via this bridge. In the future, after the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is built, the three towns of Wuhan will be fully connected. The expansion project of the Wuchang Shipyard under the Shipbuilding Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building is proceeding intensely with the construction of slipways and docks. After the successful expansion of this factory, the annual total output value will increase fivefold compared to the present. The first sleeper anti-corrosion factory in New China, under construction in Hanyang, is diligently installing machinery and is expected to be put into production in May of this year. To meet the needs of industrial development in the Wuhan area, a central substation of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau has been completed. The Wuhan Power Machinery Plant, engaged in manufacturing new-style small and medium-sized power machinery, is being relocated and expanded. As basic construction tasks increase, requiring a large amount of hardware, a new rolling iron hardware factory and a machine wood factory are under construction. At the same time, to meet the material and cultural needs of the people, the expansion of the South Central Xinhua Printing Factory and the construction of an automated rice processing plant are also being carried out at an accelerated pace.

In 1953, school construction projects in the Wuhan area ranked second in the total amount of basic construction work in the city. The newly built and expanded construction area is nearly 370,000 square meters. Among them, the largest investment is in higher and secondary technical schools that cultivate talents for industrial construction. A new type of industrial college—the Central China Institute of Technology—will be fully completed in the summer of 1954. Its construction area is equivalent to the total construction area of Wuhan University in the past 25 years; its practical training factory can accommodate 160 new-style lathes. Wuhan Geological School, Iron and Steel School, as well as industrial schools for automobile manufacturing, hydropower, construction engineering, and textiles, are also under construction, all of which cultivate national construction talents. In order to meet the needs of correspondingly developing the transportation industry, the Wuhan River Transportation College, a higher education institution for training inland waterway transportation talents, is being expanded. Schools of Navigation, Communications, and Posts and Telecommunications are being, or will be, newly built and expanded. The construction project of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy School has been basically completed. Worker-Peasant Middle Schools and Secondary Normal Schools have also undergone new construction and expansion projects.

In 1953, more than a dozen hospitals in the city were expanded, with a construction area of more than 50,000 square meters; at the same time, several cultural palaces and floodlit courts were built, and some staff dormitories and office buildings were constructed as needed.

In 1953, corresponding development was also achieved in municipal construction. At present, Wuhan's urban planning work is being actively carried out. The staff of the Wuhan Municipal Urban Construction Committee, who are responsible for this work, have collected some data, completed the measurement work of a vast heavy industrial factory area, and completed the drafting of the overall plan for Wuhan City.

In 1954, the basic construction tasks in the Wuhan area will be more complex. The workers, cadres, and technicians participating in basic construction are now enthusiastically participating in the study of the general line and general task of the state during the transition period and will improve this year's basic construction work on the basis of summarizing the experiences and lessons learned in 1953.

    武汉地区一九五三年基本建设获得成就
    一九五三年，武汉地区在基本建设方面获得了许多成就。武汉长江大桥建设重要组成部分之一的汉水铁桥工程于去年开工。这座桥建成以后，京汉铁路的火车就可以通过这座铁桥直接开到汉阳。将来，武汉长江大桥兴建后，武汉三镇就可以完全接连起来。中央第一机械工业部船舶工业局武昌造船厂扩建工程正紧张地进行滑道和船台等工程的施工。这个工厂扩建成功后，每年生产总值将比现在增加五倍。在汉阳建设的新中国第一个枕木防腐工厂正紧张地进行机器安装工程，预计今年五月即可投入生产。适应武汉地区工业发展的需要，武汉冶电业局一座中心变电站已经完工。从事新式中小型动力机器制造的武汉动力机厂正在迁厂扩建。随着基本建设任务的增加，需要大量的五金器材，一座新的轧铁五金厂和机器制材厂正在兴建中。同时，为适应人民物质文化生活的需要，中南新华印刷厂扩建厂房和一座自动化加工米厂的建设工程也在加紧进行。
    武汉地区一九五三年内的学校建设工程，在全市基本建设工作总量中占第二位。新建和扩建的建筑面积近三十七万平方公尺。其中投资最大的是培养工业建设人材的高等和中等技术学校。新建的一所新型工业学院——华中工学院一九五四年夏季就要全部完工。它的建筑面积相当于武汉大学二十五年来建筑面积的总和；它的实习工厂可安放新式车床一百六十部。培养国家建设人材的武汉地质学校、钢铁学校、以及汽车制造、水力发电、建筑工程、纺织等工业学校也正在兴建中。为了满足相应地发展交通运输业的需要，培养内河航运人材的高等学校——武汉河运学院在扩建中，航务、交通、邮电学校等校正在或将要新建和扩建。长江水利学校的建校工程，已基本上完成。工农中学、中等师范学校也进行了新建和扩建工程。
    一九五三年中，全市有十几个医院进行了扩建，建筑面积达五万多平方公尺；同时又修建了几所文化宫和灯光球场，根据需要建筑了一些职工宿舍和办公楼房。
    一九五三年在市政建设方面也得到了相应的发展。现在，武汉市的城市规划工作正在积极地进行。担负着这个工作的武汉市城市建设委员会的工作人员们，已经搜集了部分资料，完成了一个广阔的重工业工厂区的测量工作，完成了武汉市总体规划的远景草图编制工作。
    一九五四年，武汉地区的基本建设任务将更复杂，参加基本建设的工人、干部和技术人员们，现在热烈地参加了国家过渡时期的总路线总任务的学习，将在总结一九五三年工作经验教训的基础上，使今年的基本建设工作提高一步。
