On New Year's Day, 1954, the People's Government of the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region was established on the west bank of the Honghe River in Yunnan Province, on the southwestern frontier of the motherland. The autonomous region is equivalent to a special district level and includes Jinping, Yuanyang, and Honghe counties, as well as parts of Hekou City, Yuanjiang County, and Mojiang County. The total area of the region is more than 10,000 square kilometers, with a population of 400,000, including more than ten ethnic groups such as Hani, Yi, Dai, Miao, Yao, and Han, of which the Hani people account for 240,000. Within the autonomous region, except for a few plains, there are continuous mountains, and the Honghe River flows through the valleys. In the mountains are terraced fields, with rice as the main crop of the autonomous region. The autonomous region also produces cash crops such as cotton, sugarcane, and ramie. Tropical fruits such as bananas and pineapples, and valuable medicines such as musk and deer antler, are also abundant.

Before liberation, due to the national discord created by the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, there was no unity between the ethnic groups. Heavy taxes and levies forced the people living here to live in poverty and suffering. Most people lacked six or seven months of food each year and relied on wild vegetables to satisfy their hunger. In 1949, under the leadership of the underground Communist Party of Yunnan, the people of all ethnic groups in the Honghe area organized guerrilla forces to resist the oppression of the reactionary rulers. After liberation, the local Party committees and people's governments at all levels correctly implemented ethnic policies, mediated disputes between ethnic groups, and united the various ethnic groups and within them as never before. A new atmosphere of unity, harmony, and prosperity emerged everywhere.

The Party committees and people's governments of the counties in the Honghe area have vigorously led and helped the people of all ethnic groups to develop agricultural production, rapidly changing the face of the Honghe area. The people's government has successively issued various relief funds, subsidies, and agricultural loans totaling more than 8.92 billion yuan. State-owned trading companies supplied approximately 35,000 pieces of various agricultural tools, such as hoes, sickles, and plowshares, prompting them to quickly restore and develop production. In Yuanyang County alone, the cultivated land area was expanded by more than 47,000 mu. Many mountainous areas have changed the backward slash-and-burn production methods. Under the leadership of the government, the people of all ethnic groups organized themselves to put out the insect and animal plagues that often occurred in history, ensuring consecutive years of increased production, and more than 400 production models and animal-fighting heroes emerged. According to preliminary statistics, the total grain output of the counties in the Honghe area in 1953 increased by 70% to 100% compared with before liberation, and the living standards of the local people of all ethnic groups have improved. The sales volume of local trading companies in October last year increased by more than double compared with the same period of the previous year.

All counties in the autonomous region have established health centers, and many districts have also set up health stations and maternity stations. The health institutions in the counties also regularly organize mobile medical teams to go to the countryside to provide free medical treatment for the people of all ethnic groups. A large-scale ethnic hospital located in Xinjie, Yuanyang County, has been successfully built and has begun to accommodate patients from all ethnic groups.

In the past four years, the counties of the autonomous region have also successively held training classes for ethnic cadres, agricultural and forestry water conservancy training classes, and primary health personnel training classes to train cadres of all ethnic groups and select outstanding children of all ethnic groups to study at Yunnan, Southwest, or the Central University for Nationalities. More than 3,000 people have been trained, and some have already taken up work in local government agencies. (Xinhua News Agency)

    云南省红河哈尼族自治区介绍
    一九五四年元旦，在祖国西南边疆云南省的红河西岸，红河哈尼族自治区人民政府成立了。自治区相当于专区级，包括金平、元阳、红河等三县及河口市、元江县和墨江县的各一部分。全区面积约有一万多平方公里，人口达四十万，包括哈尼、彝、傣、苗、瑶、汉等十多个民族，其中哈尼族占二十四万人。自治区境内，除少数平坝外，都是绵延不断的崇山峻岭，红河在峡谷中奔流着。在山间有层层梯田，稻谷为自治区的主要农作物。自治区还出产棉花、甘蔗、苎麻等经济作物。香蕉、菠萝等热带水果，麝香、鹿茸等名贵药品，出产也很丰富。
    解放前，由于国民党反动统治者制造民族纠纷，各民族间互不团结；繁重的苛捐杂税，迫使生活在这里的人民，过着贫困痛苦的生活，大多数人每年都要缺少六七个月的口粮，靠野菜等充饥。一九四九年，红河地区的各族人民，曾在中共云南地下党的领导下，纷纷组织游击武装，反抗反动统治者的压迫。解放后，当地各级中共党委和人民政府正确执行民族政策，调解了各民族间存在的纠纷，使各个民族间和各民族内部空前地团结起来，各地呈现一片团结和睦欣欣向荣的新气象。
    红河地区各县的中共党委和人民政府，曾经大力领导和帮助各族人民发展农业生产，迅速改变了红河地区的面貌。人民政府先后发放了各种救济款、补助费及农业贷款八十九亿二千多万元。国营贸易公司供应了锄头、镰刀、犁铧等各种农具约三万五千多件，促使他们迅速地恢复和发展了生产。其中仅元阳一县，即扩大了耕地面积四万七千多亩。很多山区已改变了刀耕火种的落后生产方法。各族人民并在政府的领导下组织起来，扑灭了历史上常发生的虫灾、兽灾，保证了连年增产，并涌现出四百多个生产模范和打兽英雄。据初步统计，一九五三年红河地区各县的粮食总产量，已比解放前增加了百分之七十到一百，当地各族人民的生活已有了改善。各地贸易公司去年十月的售货量，已比前年同期增加了一倍以上。
    自治区各县都已建立了卫生院，很多区还设立了卫生所和接生站。各县卫生机构并经常组织巡回医疗小组，下乡为各族人民免费医治疾病。设立在元阳县新街的一座规模宏大的民族医院已修建成功，并开始收容各族病人。
    自治区各县四年来还陆续举办了民族干部训练班、农林水利训练班及初级卫生人员训练班等，培养各民族的干部，并选送各族优秀子弟到云南、西南或中央民族学院学习，前后共训练了三千多人，有一部分已在当地政府机关中担任工作。　　（新华社）
