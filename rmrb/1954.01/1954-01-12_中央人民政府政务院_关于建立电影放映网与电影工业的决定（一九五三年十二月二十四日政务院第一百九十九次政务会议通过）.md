In order to make films meet the needs of our country's economic and cultural construction, further exert their educational role for the broad masses of people, and satisfy the people's growing cultural demands, it is necessary to develop the film projection industry in a planned and step-by-step manner, so as to gradually establish a film projection network throughout the country. Over the past four years, film projection work has developed rapidly, the number of projection units has increased sharply, and the number of viewers has risen year by year, which increasingly proves the importance of films in the cultural life of the masses. However, from a national perspective, the number of projection units is still small, and their distribution is uneven. People in many places cannot see movies all year round, and the working masses have a very urgent need for films. Cultural departments at all levels lack regular leadership and management of projection work. The production and distribution of films have failed to guarantee the supply and rational circulation of films well. At the same time, films have not been selected well according to different audience groups. The political quality and projection technology of projection teams have not reached the required level. In order to strengthen the distribution and projection of films in the future, steadily establish a national film projection network, and gradually establish a film industry in accordance with this, the following decisions are made:

	(1) The guiding principle for the development of the film projection industry is to first face industrial and mining areas, and then face rural areas; in small cities and vast rural areas, the focus should be on developing mobile projection teams. We should conscientiously formulate annual and regional development plans for projection units based on objective and subjective conditions and the unbalanced development in various regions, and roughly determine the figures for the development plan for the next four years. We should actively and steadily develop on the basis of consolidating existing projection units; avoid and overcome the phenomenon of blindly developing without regard to conditions and failing to consolidate after development.

	(2) Strengthen the management of film projection work and give full play to the due effectiveness of projection units. The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture should first improve the film projection management organization, effectively grasp the national film projection industry development plan and business plan, and supervise its implementation. Formulate technical regulations to improve projection quality. The cultural departments of the people's governments of all provinces (cities) should strengthen and establish special film projection management organizations or special personnel, and formulate the development plan and business plan of the projection industry in the entire region according to the specific conditions of the local area. The provincial cultural departments should focus on managing the work of mobile projection teams in the entire region; delineate the activity areas of the projection teams, and assign them to the direct leadership of the special zone or county cultural departments according to the specific circumstances; formulate the working days and work system of the projection teams, and regularly check and guide the work of the projection teams; regularly hold rotational training for projectionists, and strengthen their regular political and ideological education by the special zone or county. The municipal cultural departments should focus on managing the work of cinemas.

	In order to ensure the repair and supply of spare parts for projection machines, large administrative regions should establish repair factories, and provinces should establish repair stations to carry out the repair of projection machines and the repair and replacement of parts in a timely manner.

	The projection units of the trade union system should be managed independently by the professional organizations established by trade unions at all levels, but their development plans, business plans, etc. should conform to the unified regulations of the film projection management organizations of the government cultural departments. The projection units of the military system are led by the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army.

	(3) Strengthen and improve the distribution of films. Under the China Film Distribution Corporation system, improve the distribution organizations in various provinces to meet the needs of the development of the film projection industry; ensure the timely supply of necessary films to projection teams and cinemas in various places; select films according to different audience groups, especially the projection programs for farmers must be popular and easy to understand; strengthen the planning of film distribution, strengthen the management, protection and inspection system of films, strengthen the circulation of films, and give full play to the use value of each copy. Strengthen the publicity and explanation of film content, and especially provide rural projection teams with suitable film publicity materials in a timely manner.

	(4) Film projection teams should gradually implement enterprise management and must reduce state subsidies year by year; however, in border areas, ethnic minority areas, and some areas with sparse population and inconvenient transportation, they must proceed steadily according to the actual situation and avoid being too hasty. Film distribution agencies and state-owned cinemas must all implement enterprise management, improve the management system, and in the future, they must not only be self-sufficient, but also gradually achieve surpluses to be turned over.

	(5) In order to supply the projectors needed for the development of the projection industry, gradually unify the specifications of projectors nationwide, in order to improve the quality of projection technology and achieve complete self-sufficiency of projectors in the future, it is necessary to establish a projector manufacturing industry. Within two years, the expansion and construction of the existing two projector manufacturing plants should be completed, so that they can produce the latest large and small projectors, stipulating the maximum annual output of 280 large projectors and 2,500 small projectors, and the relevant industrial departments should cooperate in producing main auxiliary components such as generators and amplification devices required by the projection teams.

	(6) In order to supply the large number of copies needed by the projection units, the current manual film washing and printing method must be changed to machine washing and printing. A modern film washing and printing factory should be built within two or three years to achieve the annual washing and printing of films that can meet the needs of the country.

	(7) In order to achieve self-sufficiency in film stock and ensure film production, preparations must be made to establish a film stock manufacturing factory, and strive to complete and start production within five years, first manufacturing black and white positive film for the washing and printing of a large number of copies, gradually increasing production, and then manufacturing black and white and color films and plates of various types. To this end, the Higher Education Department of the Central Government and relevant industrial departments should assist the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture in supplementing and training technical personnel in machinery and chemical engineering required by the film industry.

	(8) According to the development needs of the film projection industry, projection personnel should be trained in a planned manner, and special attention should be paid to absorbing a large number of knowledgeable youths from worker and peasant backgrounds. Large administrative regions or provinces and cities with conditions should plan to hold training classes for projection personnel; film schools should be responsible for training teachers who can undertake this training work. In addition, existing projection personnel should be rotated to make them excellent projectionists who are technically proficient, loyal to their duties, and also propagandists with a certain level of political awareness.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于建立电影放映网与电影工业的决定
    （一九五三年十二月二十四日政务院第一百九十九次政务会议通过）
    为使电影适应我国经济和文化建设的需要，更大地发挥其对广大人民的教育作用，满足群众日益增长的文化要求，必须有计划、有步骤地发展电影放映事业，以逐渐达到在全国范围内建立电影放映网。四年来电影放映工作已有迅速发展，放映单位数量激增，观众人数逐年上涨，日益证明了电影在群众文化生活中的重要性。但就全国范围说，放映单位数量尚少，且分布不平衡，很多地方人民终年看不到电影，劳动群众对电影的要求非常迫切。各级文化主管部门对放映工作缺乏经常的领导和管理。影片的制作和发行工作未能很好地保证影片供应和合理周转。同时又未能很好地按照不同观众对象选择影片。放映队员的政治质量和放映技术未能达到应有的水平。为加强今后电影的发行和放映工作，稳步地建立全国电影放映网，并与此相适应地逐步建立电影工业，特作如下决定：
    （一）电影放映事业发展的方针是首先面向工矿地区，然后面向农村；在小城市和广大农村，则以发展流动放映队为主。应切实根据主客观条件，各地发展不平衡的状况，制定全年的、分区的放映单位发展计划，并大体定出今后四年发展计划的数字。应在整理和巩固现有放映单位的基础上积极地、稳步地发展；避免和克服不顾条件盲目发展及发展起来不加巩固的现象。
   （二）加强电影放映工作的管理，充分发挥放映单位应有的效能。中央文化部电影局首先应健全电影放映管理机构，切实掌握全国电影放映事业发展计划和经营计划并监督执行。制定技术规程，提高放映质量。各省（市）人民政府文化主管部门应加强和建立电影放映管理的专门机构或专门人员，按照当地的具体情况，定出全区放映事业的发展计划和经营计划。省文化主管部门应着重管理全区流动放映队的工作；划定放映队的活动地区，根据具体情况分别交由专区或县文化主管部门直接领导，制订放映队的工作日和工作制度，经常检查并指导放映队的工作；定期举办放映员的轮训，并由专区或县对其加强经常的政治思想教育。市文化主管部门应着重管理影院的工作。
    为保证放映机器的修理和配件供应，各大行政区应成立修配厂，各省应成立修理站，及时进行放映机器的修理及零件修配工作。
    工会系统放映单位应由各级工会成立专业机构自行管理，但其发展计划、经营计划等，则应符合政府文化主管部门电影放映管理机构的统一规定。部队系统的放映单位，由人民解放军总政治部领导。
      （三）加强并改进影片的发行工作，在中国电影发行公司系统下，健全和改进各省的发行机构，以适应电影放映事业发展的需要；保证及时供应各地放映队和电影院以必需的影片；依据不同观众对象选择影片，特别对农民的放映节目必须通俗易懂；加强影片发行的计划性，加强影片的管理、保护和检查制度，加强影片流转，充分发挥每一拷贝的使用价值。加强对影片内容的宣传解释工作，特别应及时供应农村放映队以合适的电影宣传资料。
     （四）电影放映队应逐步实行企业经营，并须做到逐年减少国家补贴；但在边疆、少数民族地区和某些地瘠人稀交通不便的地区必须根据实际情况稳步前进，避免操之过急。影片发行机构、国营影院必须全部实行企业化，改善经营管理制度，今后不但要能自给自足，而且要逐渐做到有盈余上缴。
      （五）为供应发展放映事业所需要的放映机，逐步统一全国放映机的规格，借以提高放映技术的质量，并达到今后放映机的全部自给，必须建立放映机器制造工业。在两年内应完成现有两个放映机制造厂的扩大和修建工作，使能生产最新型的大型及小型放映机，规定最高年产量为大型的二八○台和小型的二五○○台，并由有关工业部门配合生产为放映队所需的发电机、扩音装置等主要附属机件。
      （六）为供应放映单位所需要的大量拷贝，必须改变目前手工洗印影片的方式为机器洗印，应在两、三年内建成一个现代化的影片洗印工厂，达到每年洗印影片能供应全国需要。
      （七）为达到电影胶片自给，保证影片生产，必须着手准备建立电影胶片制造工厂，争取在五年内建成并开始生产，首先制造为供给洗印大量拷贝之用的黑白正片，逐步增加生产，而后制造黑白、彩色的各种胶片和胶板。为此，中央高等教育部及有关工业部门应协助中央文化部电影局补充和培养电影工业所需要的机械和化工方面的技术人员。
      （八）按照电影放映事业的发展需要，应有计划地训练放映人员，并应特别注意大量吸收工农成分的知识青年参加。各大行政区或具有条件的省、市，均应有计划地举办放映人员训练班；电影学校应负责培养足以担任此项训练工作的师资。此外，并应轮训现有放映人员，使他们成为技术熟练、忠于职守的优秀放映员，又是具有一定政治水平的宣传员。
