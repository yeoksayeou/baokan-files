A Night of Ideological Struggle
By our reporter Lü Jianzhong

Guo Xiangyuan has been struggling ideologically particularly intensely these past few days. He can't eat, can't sleep, tossing and turning as he considers the issue of selling grain.

Although the village has been holding meetings constantly these past few days, and the comrades from the work team and the village head have explained many principles, such as: without industrialization, we cannot consolidate national defense, we cannot transform agriculture and live a happy life, the capitalist road is a dead end, the state controlling grain is to stabilize prices and ensure supply, and so on. Guo Xiangyuan has also preliminarily understood these issues from practical experience, and knows that the old road cannot be taken. But what exactly is the new road like? He still feels a bit uneasy in his heart. Therefore, he must carefully consider it several times before he can decide exactly how much surplus grain to sell.

Tonight, the meeting ended early. Guo Xiangyuan and the members of the mutual aid team had worked in the fields all day and were quite tired. He added a handful of grass to the cattle and went to bed.

But he tossed and turned, unable to sleep. He thought: there are three people in the family to feed, and including both the old and new grain, there is a surplus of a thousand catties. He definitely has to sell some. Shou Nian, who is going to school, keeps asking for a cotton coat, and his mother is already sixty years old, can't spin yarn, so buy her a woolen coat too. As the director of the school affairs committee, others have flashlights and I don't. Break up two and a half dou of wheat to buy one, so it's convenient to go out to meetings at night. Also, he needs to buy some fertilizer. However, he should sell three dou today and five dou tomorrow, so as not to attract attention. If he sells three or four shi at once, won't people say he's rich? Then he recalled: That year, the puppet Pao-chang Ma Liuzi wanted to make a fortune by smoking opium, so he colluded with the puppet district chief, pretending to ask me to carry back the coal that Ma Liuzi had stolen. The puppet district chief grabbed me and falsely accused me of stealing coal, beat me severely, and ended up fining me a gun and fifty bullets. Thinking of suffering that humiliation was really heartbreaking. But then he thought again, the Communist Party has never treated me wrong since it came. The People's Government always calls for developing production. Guo Zhenyu in the east of the village harvested 720 catties of grain per mu, and the government even issued a certificate of merit for being a model of high yield. Speaking of myself, when I had difficulties in production a few years ago, the government provided loans to help me. Now the team has new plows, waterwheels, and sprayers, everything. Last year my wheat yield was 400 catties per mu, 50 catties more than the year before, but the public grain hasn't increased at all. Hmm, this is the new society, as long as you work, the richer you get, the better. Yesterday the comrades of the work team also said so!

But he has to plan well where to spend the money after selling the grain. He had thought about buying land in the past. Although now there are three people in the family and seven and a half mu of land, which is enough, Shou Nian is ten years old, and when he gets married in the future, and gives me two grandchildren, won't the land be less? He heard that Wang Youlu plans to buy 150 mu of land for his three sons! Isn't he also a rich middle peasant? But these days the meetings say that buying land is a spontaneous force, is taking the capitalist road, and that also makes some sense. If we buy land, won't others have less land? But if you don't buy land, what if you can't spend the money? The comrades of the work team said that a credit cooperative should be established, and it would be good to deposit it in the credit cooperative, but for example, if there is something happy and you go to withdraw money, won't people say it's a waste? But this is my own business, and the government has never interfered. …

The faint moonlight shone in through the cracks in the window, reflecting the five grain jars neatly arranged against the western wall. The wheat grains were plump, and the rice grains were golden, and Guo Xiangyuan felt a burst of joy in his heart. Suddenly, he caught sight of the blocked hole in the wall to the right of the grain jars, and a wave of sadness surged into his heart again: Before liberation, the grain jars were also placed here, and one day he woke up early in the morning and saw that a large hole had been dug in the wall, and when he looked again, the grain in the jars had been stolen. He was in a hurry, wanted to shout, but didn't dare. Later, he heard rumors that the village's hooligans had stolen it, but he didn't dare to say anything, and only secretly shed tears several times. Then the old Guo Wangdu Village appeared in his mind again: Japanese bayonets, the whips of landlords and puppet Bao-changs, the miserable cries of hungry peasants… He thought of the words of the comrades of the work team again: Taking the capitalist road of exploitation, a few people get rich, and most people suffer poverty… Wouldn't that be like the old society again, unable to live in peace? Only by taking the socialist bright road of mutual aid and cooperation can we rise together and make everyone live a prosperous life. Then he thought that now he doesn't even close the door at night when he goes to sleep, why doesn't anyone come to steal? Isn't this because everyone has been allocated land after liberation, the exploitation of the landlord class has been abolished, everyone works, everyone has food to eat, and the world can be so peaceful? Hey! The old road cannot be taken, it really cannot be taken! Wang Youlu's plan is not correct.

He turned back to think about the new road: Since joining the mutual aid team, and with the government's loan support, strong labor, and sufficient farm tools, he and the masses of the whole village have dug six canals, more than 2,000 zhang long, turning more than 1,900 mu of dry land in the whole village into irrigated land; and he also dug a three-li long drainage ditch, so that 150 mu of land is not flooded, so the yield is higher year by year. Look at the current Guo Wangdu Village, it is really full of mules and horses, and the five grains are abundant. I can have so much surplus grain, isn't it because I organized and improved the production tools and production technology? Otherwise, in 1951, I harvested 250 catties of wheat per mu, how could I harvest 400 catties per mu in 1953? But it's still not as good as the cooperative. The village chief Guo Shenglin's (Communist Party member) cooperative harvests 20 catties more per mu than the average! Conversely, the expenses are much less than in the past. Just like coal, before liberation, one catty of rice exchanged for two catties, now one catty of rice exchanges for thirteen and a half catties, salt, before liberation, it took more than two catties of rice to exchange for one catty, now one catty of rice can exchange for one catty, not to mention the whole village, just my family alone, can save two shi of grain a year. In this way, the comrades of the work team said that only national industrialization can help agricultural collectivization and increase grain production; and only by selling the surplus grain to the state, supporting industrial construction, can we stabilize prices and live a socialist happy life like the Soviet Union sooner. This is really true.

He also thought about the issue of establishing a cooperative: It had been brewing for some time, and ten or so of the 21 households in the group agreed. I agreed verbally at the time, but I was thinking that now I benefit more from the labor of the poor peasants. If a cooperative is established, won't the poor peasants divide my grain more? Now, this thought is wrong, rise together! Besides, land shares, remuneration according to labor, no one will suffer. Yes, we must establish a cooperative, and tomorrow I will help the group leader Li Busheng mobilize the group members to establish it quickly.

The more he thought about it, the more happy he became, thinking about discussing with Shou Nian's mother how much grain to sell. He turned over, and Shou Nian's mother was sleeping soundly because she had been picking cotton firewood all day. He thought: Forget it, didn't she say to let me decide during the family meeting during the day? Then let me decide, sell a thousand catties, buy more fertilizer, so that in 1954, the wheat yield per mu will be 500 catties. Thinking of this, his heart was as bright as after the rain. He closed his eyes and was about to fall asleep drowsily. Suddenly, the siren of the Yubei Yarn Factory in Anyang City let out a majestic roar, and the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative of Party Branch Secretary Lu Daoping also rang a crisp bell. This sound, he used to hear several times a day, but now it sounds particularly kind. He was refreshed, opened his eyes and saw that it was dawn.

    一夜的思想斗争
    本报记者　吕建中
    郭祥元这几天思想斗争得特别厉害，饭也吃不下，觉也睡不好，翻来覆去地考虑卖粮的问题。
    虽然这几天村里不断地开会，工作组的同志和村长也讲了许多道理，如没有工业化就不能巩固国防啦，就不能改造农业、过幸福生活啦，资本主义道路是死路一条啦，国家掌握粮食是为了稳定物价保证供应啦，等等，郭祥元也初步从实际中体会到了这些问题，知道旧道路不能走；可是新道路到底怎样呢？他心里还有点不蹋实。因此，必须再好好考虑几遍，然后才能决定究竟卖多少余粮。
    今天晚上散会很早，郭祥元和互助组员们耕作了一天，挺疲乏，给牛添上一把草就睡下了。
    可是他翻来覆去睡不着，心里想：家里三口人吃饭，陈粮加新粮能余一千斤，横竖得卖点；守年上学成天吵着要件棉大衣，他娘也六十岁了，不能纺花，也给她买件绒衣吧；我当学委会主任，人家都有手电筒我没有，破上二斗半麦子买一个，晚上出去开会方便。另外还得买点肥料哩。不过，要今天三斗明天五斗的卖，才不招风，一下子卖三石、四石，人家不说自己富？于是他回想起：那年伪保长马六子想捞一笔钱抽大烟，就和伪区长勾结起来，假装叫我把马六子偷的煤背回来，伪区长一把抓住我，诬赖我偷煤，毒打一顿，结果罚了一支枪、五十粒子弹了事。想起受那窝囊气实在伤心。他又反回来想，自从共产党来了可没有错待过我，人民政府总是叫发展生产，东头郭振玉的谷子每亩收七百二十斤，政府还发给丰产模范奖状。就说我自己吧，前几年生产上有困难，政府贷款扶助，现在组里新式犁、水车、喷雾器，样样都有，去年我一亩小麦合四百斤收，比前年每亩多收五十斤，公粮可没多出一点。嗯，这是新社会，只要是劳动，所得越富越好，昨天工作组的同志也是这样讲嘛！
      不过卖了粮，钱往那里用可得计划好。买地的事过去也曾想过，虽然现在三口人，七亩半地，足够了，可是守年十来岁了，将来娶了媳妇，再给我生上两个孙孙，那地不就少了？听说人家王友禄打算给三个儿子买下一百五十亩地哩！他不也是老中农吗？可是这几天开会说买地是自发势力，是走资本主义道路，这也有点道理，咱买了地，别人的地岂不就少了？不过要是不买地，钱花不完怎么办？工作组的同志说要成立信贷社，存到信贷社里好倒好，可是比方说有什么喜事去取钱人家不说是浪费？不过这是自己的事，政府可从来没有干涉过呀。……
    淡淡的月光从窗缝中射进来，映着西墙根下并摆着的五口粮食缸，麦粒饱满，谷粒金黄，郭祥元心里一阵喜欢。突然，他一眼瞥见了粮食缸右边墙壁上那个堵死了的洞口，一股伤心事又涌上心头了：解放前粮食缸也是摆在这里，有一天清早起来一看，墙壁挖了一个大洞，又一看，缸里的粮食被偷走了。一阵心急，想嚷吧，又不敢，后来风闻是村里那几个地痞流氓偷走的，但是不敢吭气，只暗地流了几次泪。于是旧的郭王度村，又浮现在他脑子里了：日本的刺刀、地主伪保长的鞭子、饥饿农民的惨叫……他又想起工作组同志的话来了：走资本主义剥削的路，少数人发财，多数人受穷……那不是又像旧社会一样过不了安生日子吗？只有走互助合作的社会主义光明大道，才能共同上升，使大家都过富裕生活。接着他想到现在夜里睡觉连大门都不关，为啥也没人来偷呢？这不就是因为解放后大家都分了土地，废除了地主阶级的剥削，人人劳动，人人有饭吃，世道才能这样太平吗？咦！旧道路走不得，实在走不得呀！王友禄那个打算不正确。
    他又回过头来想新道路了：自从参加了互助组，政府又贷款扶助，劳力强，农具足，和全村群众一起挖了六条渠道，两千多丈长，把全村一千九百多亩旱田变成了水浇地；还挖了一条三里长的排水沟，使一百五十亩地不受水淹，所以产量一年比一年高。看看现在的郭王度村吧，真是骡马成群，五谷丰登。我自己能有这么多的余粮，还不就是因为组织起来，改进了生产工具和生产技术？要不一九五一年我每亩小麦收二百五十斤，凭着什么一九五三年收四百斤呢？不过还比不上合作社，人家村长郭生林（中共党员）的合作社每亩比一般的多收二十斤哩！再反过来，开支可就比过去减少的多了。就像煤吧，解放前一斤米换二斤，现在一斤米换十三斤半，食盐，解放前二斤多米才换一斤，现在一斤米就能换一斤，不说全村，光我这一户，一年就能省两石粮食。这样看起来，工作组同志说只有国家工业化才能帮助农业集体化，才能增产粮食；也只有把余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设，才能稳定物价，才能早些过着像苏联那样的社会主义幸福的生活。这话实在有道理。
    他又想到成立合作社的问题了：前些日子也酝酿过，全组二十一户中有十来户同意。我当时口说同意，心里却想着现在我多沾贫农的劳动力，成立了合作社贫农不是要多分我的粮食了吗？现在看，这思想不对头，共同上升嘛！再说，土地入股，按劳取酬，谁也不会吃亏呀。对，一定成立合作社，明天就帮着组长李步生动员组员，赶快就把它成立起来。
    他越想越痛快，想和守年娘商量商量到底卖多少粮，翻过身来，守年娘因为白天拾掇了一天棉花柴，睡的挺香。他想：算了吧，白天开家庭会时，她不是说由我吗？那就由我，卖一千斤，多买点肥料，让一九五四年小麦每亩收它五百斤。他想到这里，心里像雨过天晴那样的畅亮。他合上眼睛，矇矇眬眬地要入睡了，突然，安阳市豫北纱厂的汽笛发出了雄壮的吼叫，党支部书记路道平的那个先锋农业生产合作社也响起了清脆的钟声，这声音，他过去一天听到好几次，但是现在听起来却特别亲切。他精神一振，睁开眼睛一看，天明了。
