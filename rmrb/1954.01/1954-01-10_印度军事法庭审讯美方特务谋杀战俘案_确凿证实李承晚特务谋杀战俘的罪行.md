Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th - Today, the second witness to testify at the Indian Military Tribunal identified the defendant Li Qingqi (transliteration) as the murderer who killed Choi Jong-jun, one of the four Korean POWs who wanted to be repatriated, in Camp No. 38 on December 12th of last year. The murderer had put a rope around Choi Jong-jun's neck and trampled him to death.

This witness was Yoon Ki-bok (transliteration), a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army. He was the one who walked out of Camp No. 38 when the Indian guards entered the camp to arrest the murderer after the murder occurred. Pointing to the murderer, who was sitting quietly in the defendant's seat with his head down, he excitedly recounted how Choi Jong-jun was killed. This witness lived in the same tent as Choi Jong-jun and was present when the murder occurred.

Yoon Ki-bok said: "On the evening of December 12th last year, there were shouts outside my tent: 'Catch this Communist.' At that time, Yoon Hyung-il (i.e., the first witness who testified in court yesterday) was climbing the barbed wire." He said that shortly after this escape incident, all the "small team leaders" in the camp were summoned to the "brigade headquarters" for a meeting. When they returned, they told the other POWs that the four POWs who intended to escape with Yoon Hyung-il, who climbed the barbed wire, would be punished that evening.

Later, Choi Jong-jun was brought into the tent by the head of the camp's "security team" and another person (both of whom are on trial). Before killing Choi Jong-jun, Li Qingqi said, "It doesn't matter to me to kill one more person. I have already killed six people in Busan." He then put a rope around Choi Jong-jun's neck, tightened the rope forcefully, threw Choi to the ground, and then stomped on him with his feet until he stomped him to death.

Another witness, who also lived in the same tent and witnessed the murder, confirmed the details of the murder to the court.

The American "defense lawyer" repeatedly asked cunning questions today in an attempt to confuse the two witnesses, but the two witnesses did not waver in the slightest. The American "lawyer's" questions only exposed the heinous truth that the American side used armed forces, bullets, and tanks to prevent the repatriation of POWs.

An American "defense lawyer" asked Yoon Ki-bok if he had ever been given the "choice" to decide whether to return home or stay in South Korea. The witness said that in his camp on Geoje Island, all the POWs wanted to be repatriated. However, the American military, attempting to forcibly detain them, sent troops to break up the POW camps with tanks, tear gas, and guns. Yoon Ki-bok said that he hoped to be repatriated during the subsequent "screening." He said, "My parents are both in North Korea, and I want to go back to them. But I was afraid, so I didn't dare to say so. During the 'screening,' we were surrounded by fully armed troops."

Today, American reporters did not attend the important trial held by the Indian Custodial Forces in the Demilitarized Zone. Only reporters from the Korean-Chinese side and neutral countries attended the trial. Obviously, the evidence provided by the witnesses and the damning facts were too obvious to be distorted even by the American-controlled newspapers. Therefore, American reporters did not come to attend.

The trial will continue tomorrow morning.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th - After three days of trial by the Indian Military Tribunal, it has been undoubtedly determined that Syngman Rhee's agents murdered four POWs in Camp No. 38 in South who wanted to be repatriated. An Indian Major and three soldiers from the Marathas Parachute Regiment, who were guarding the camp, told the court today that they saw four bodies and some bloodstains in the camp.

One of those who saw the bodies was Major Sigal, the commander of the E-section camp where that camp was located. He testified in court: "At about 8:30 p.m. on December 12th, I received a call from the watchtower saying that four bodies had been thrown near the camp gate. I went to the camp and saw four bodies lying near the gate."

Major Sigal said that Jeon Do-gu, one of the defendants and the leader of the camp, told him at the gate at the time: "We killed them."

Major Sigal said that the bodies were later taken away by ambulance.

Major Sigal said that after the custodial forces conducted an investigation and arrested the murderers the next morning, he and some Indian officers entered the camp. He saw bloodstains all along the way from a tent in the camp to where the bodies were originally found. The Major told the court, "It seemed that someone had splashed water on the ground to wash away the bloodstains."

An Indian guard who saw the bodies and called Major Sigal also testified in court. Another Indian guard, who was stationed in a nearby watchtower and saw the bodies being dragged towards the gate, also testified in court.

Three Korean POWs, who witnessed the massacre, pointed out one of the defendants, Li Qingqi, saying that he put a rope around Choi Jong-jun's neck, threw him to the ground, and stomped him to death with his feet. The testimonies of these three people, who lived in the same tent as the victims, were completely consistent, even though they had been separated by the Indian custodial forces since they left Camp No. 38 more than twenty days ago and were not allowed to see each other.

Over the past three days, witnesses have revealed in court the brutal methods used by the American military to forcibly detain POWs in South Korean POW camps. All the witnesses testified that the American side used violence and starvation to achieve this goal. One witness said that the American military used tanks, tear gas, and guns to attack the POW camp where he lived on Geoje Island, because all the POWs in that camp wanted to be repatriated. Another witness told the court how the American military used tear gas on a camp on Geoje Island and cut off food and medical supplies to break the will of those POWs who wanted to be repatriated.

During the interrogation conducted during today's trial, the American "defense lawyers" tried their best to prevent the witnesses from revealing the means used by the American military and their installed agents to detain POWs in South Korea or the Demilitarized Zone. When Kim Young-in (transliteration) mentioned that Choi Jong-jun had told him how he was tattooed and tortured before being killed by Syngman Rhee's agents, the American "defense lawyer" Morrison stopped him from continuing. Morrison said that these words could not be proven because Choi Jong-jun was dead. An Indian military judge said, "I disagree with your statement," and rejected Morrison's objection.

Another American "defense lawyer," O'Brien, asked Kim Young-in, "You were sent to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission as an anti-communist POW. Yet you testified that you wanted to be repatriated?"

This question angered Kim Young-in, who slapped the wooden table of the witness stand and said loudly, "In the past, I did not have the freedom to express my desire to be repatriated."

The American reporters evaded this important trial for the second day in a row. This trial exposed to the world the means used by Washington to detain Korean and Chinese POWs.

The court will continue its session on the morning of the 9th.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th - Two captains of the Indian Custodial Forces testified today at the Indian Military Tribunal trial of Syngman Rhee's agents for the murder of four Korean POWs in Camp No. 38 in South who wanted to be repatriated. These two captains were the medical personnel who transported the victims' bodies to the hospital.

Captain Kapoor said that he rushed to the camp when he learned on the night of December 12th that four people had fallen beside the camp gate, to see if these people could be given emergency treatment. He said, "But I could no longer give them emergency treatment, they were already dead."

Kapoor later put the bodies in an ambulance and handed them over to Captain Meda, who transported the four corpses to the hospital, where an autopsy was performed. The Indian doctor who performed the autopsy will report to the court tomorrow.

The court adjourned at noon today and will continue the trial tomorrow.

    印度军事法庭审讯美方特务谋杀战俘案
    确凿证实李承晚特务谋杀战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城七日电】今天出席印度军事法庭作证的第二名证人当场指证被告李庆七（译音）就是去年十二月十二日在第三十八号营场中杀害想要求遣返的四名朝鲜战俘之一的崔钟俊的凶手。这个凶手当时用绳子套在崔钟俊的脖子上并把他踩死。
    这个证人是朝鲜人民军被俘人员尹奇福（译音），他是当印度卫兵在谋杀案发生后进营场逮捕凶手时走出第三十八号营场的。他手指着低头静坐在被告席上的凶手，激动地叙述崔钟俊是如何被害死的。这名证人和崔钟俊住在一个帐篷中，谋杀发生时他在场。
    尹奇福说：“去年十二月十二日傍晚，在我的帐篷外有叫喊声：‘捉住这个共产党’，当时尹亨日（按即昨日在法庭上作证的第一个证人）正在爬铁丝网。”他说，在这次逃跑事件发生后不久，营场的全部“小队长”都被召到“大队部”去开会。后来他们回来时对其他战俘说，打算跟爬铁丝网的尹亨日一块逃跑的四名战俘在当天晚上要受到处罚。
    后来崔钟俊被营场“警备队”的头子和另外一个人（他们二人全在受审）带进帐篷中。李庆七在杀死崔钟俊以前说：“再杀一个人对我是无所谓的。我已在釜山杀死过六个人了。”他然后用绳子套在崔钟俊的脖子上，把绳子用力一勒，并把崔摔倒在地上，接着用脚踩他，一直到把他踩死。
    另一个也住在同一帐篷里而且目击了这个谋杀事件的证人，向法庭证实了这件谋杀案的经过。
    美方“辩护律师”今天在反复询问时提出狡猾的问题，要把这两个证人搞胡涂，但是这两个证人丝毫没有动摇。美方“律师”的问题反而只是暴露了美方使用武装部队、子弹和坦克车来阻止战俘遣返的罪恶真相。
    一个美方“辩护律师”问尹奇福说，他曾否得到决定回家或留在南朝鲜的“选择”机会。这个证人说，在巨济岛他的营场中，全体战俘都希望遣返。但是，企图强迫扣留他们的美国军方，却派遣军队以坦克车、毒气弹和枪炮拆散了战俘营场。尹奇福说，在接着进行的“甄别”中，他希望获得遣返。他说：“我的父母都在北朝鲜，我希望回到他们那边去。但是因为害怕，我不敢这样说。在进行‘甄别’时，全副武装的军队包围着我们。”
    今天，美方记者没有参加印度看管部队在非军事区举行的重要审判。只有朝中方面和中立国的记者参加了这次审判。显然，证人所提供的证据以及可诅咒的事实已是太明显了，甚至于美方控制的报纸也无法加以歪曲。因此美方记者没有前来参加。
    审判将在明天上午继续进行。
    【新华社开城八日电】经过印度军事法庭的三天审讯，已经毫无疑问地确定：李承晚特务在南营第三十八号营场杀害了四个想要遣返的战俘。一位印度少校和看守营场的马拉塔斯伞兵营的三名士兵今天在法庭上说，他们在这个营场中看到四具尸体和一些血迹。
    曾看到尸体的人中，有一个人就是西格尔少校，他是那个营场所在的戊字营区的长官。他在法庭上作证说：“在十二月十二日晚八时三十分左右，我接到守望塔打来的电话，说有四具尸体被人扔在营场大门附近。我到营场那里，看到有四具尸体躺在大门附近。”
    西格尔少校说，被告之一、营场领袖全道九当时在大门口告诉他说：“我们杀死了他们。”
    西格尔少校说，后来用救护车把这些尸体运走了。
    西格尔少校说，在第二天上午看管部队进行调查并把凶手们逮捕之后，他和一些印度军官进入营场。他看到从营场一个帐篷到原来尸体被发现的地方，沿路都是血迹。这位少校在法庭上说：“似乎曾有人在地上泼水，想把血迹冲掉。”
    看到尸体后打电话给西格尔少校的一个印度看守兵，也在法庭上作证。在附近一个看守塔上站岗并且看到这些尸体被拖向大门的另一个印度看守兵，也在法庭上作证。
    亲眼看到屠杀的三个朝鲜战俘，指出被告之一李庆七，说他拿绳子套在崔钟俊的脖子上，把他摔在地上，用脚把他踏死。这三个曾和受害者住在同一帐篷的人的证词，是完全互相吻合的，虽然在二十多天之前他们从第三十八号营场出来后，一直由印度看管部队进行隔离，不准互相见面。
    在过去三天中，证人们在法庭上揭露了美军为了强迫扣留南朝鲜战俘营内的战俘而使用的残酷手段。所有的证人都证明，美方为了达到这个目的，曾使用暴力和使战俘挨饿的手段。有一个证人说，美军曾使用坦克、毒气和枪炮来攻击巨济岛上他所住的那个战俘营，因为所有在这个战俘营里面的战俘都希望遣返。另外一个证人告诉法庭，美军如何对巨济岛上的一个营场使用毒气，并断绝食物和医药供应，来打破那些希望遣返的战俘的意志。
    在今天审讯进行时所作的侦讯中，美方的“辩护律师”竭力想阻止证人们揭露美军和他们所安插的特务为了在南朝鲜或非军事区扣留战俘而使用的手段。当金永仁（译音）说到崔钟俊在被李承晚特务弄死以前，曾告诉他如何被刺字和受到折磨时，美方的“辩护律师”摩里逊就阻止他讲下去。摩里逊说，这些话都无法证明，因为崔钟俊已经死了。一位印度军法官说：“我不同意你的说法”，于是驳斥了摩里逊的反对。
    另外的一个美方“辩护律师”奥勃莱恩问金永仁说：“你是作为一个反共战俘而被送交中立国遣返委员会看管的。然而你作证说，你希望被遣返？”
    这个问题激怒了金永仁，他用手拍着证人席的木桌子，大声地说道：“过去我没有自由来表达我想要遣返的希望。”
    美方的记者今天接连第二天逃避这个重要的审讯。这个审讯向全世界揭露了华盛顿为了扣留朝中战俘而使用的手段。
    法庭将在九日上午继续开庭。
      【新华社开城九日电】印度看管部队两名上尉今日在印度军事法庭审讯李承晚特务谋杀南营第三十八号营场四名希望遣返的朝鲜战俘案时，出庭作证。这两名上尉是把被害者的尸首运到医院里去的医疗人员。
    卡普尔上尉说，他在十二月十二日夜获悉有四人倒在营场大门旁时，便赶到营场去，看看这些人是否能够急救一下。他说：“但是我已不能给他们急救，他们已经死了。”
    卡普尔后来把尸首装在救护车里交给了梅达上尉，梅达上尉则把这四具死尸运到医院里去，并在那里验了尸。验尸的印度医生将于明日向法庭报告。
    法庭在今日中午休庭，明日继续审讯。
