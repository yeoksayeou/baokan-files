　　Oppose Waste of Industrial Coal
    Reader Xu Xian writes: In many local state-owned enterprises in the Northeast region, state-allocated production coal is being used for heating and cooking without authorization, violating national regulations and causing great waste. According to a survey by the Coal Industry and Building Materials Company of the Northeast Region, in the first, second, and third quarters of 1953 alone, more than 230,000 tons of coal were diverted in this way. The Eighth Paper Mill of Liaodong Province, Yingkou Paper Mill, Yingkou Fifth Textile Factory, Yingkou Cigarette Factory, and Wafangdian Textile Factory, for example, diverted 28,116 tons of production coal. Fushun Steel Plant, Petroleum Plant No. 3, and Building Materials Plant No. 1 diverted a total of 11,734 tons. Similar situations exist in Liaoxi, Songjiang, and other provinces. In Jilin Province, four units not only diverted 3,315 tons of production coal, but also sold 3,710 tons of production coal at low prices. From January to September, the local state-owned Food Company sold 210 tons of production coal to employees and a certain employee bathhouse at a low price of 60,000 yuan per ton; the local state-owned Match Factory distributed 204 tons of production coal as employee welfare coal; the Ceramics Factory sold 1,535 tons of production coal to citizens; and the Fanjiatun Sugar Factory sold 200 tons of Xi'an raw coal to employees. In Dalian City, 22 units applied to the state for the allocation of all their heating coal as production coal. Among them, the Gas Company not only used production coal for heating and cooking in its own unit, but also sold production coal to the Transportation Company and the Public Utilities Bureau.
    At present, the country is carrying out large-scale economic construction, and coal is the food of industry. The demand for industrial coal is increasing sharply. Wasting industrial coal will harm the cause of national industrialization, which cannot be tolerated. It is suggested that the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee inspect the problem of wasting industrial coal, seriously deal with illegal units, and require relevant departments to strictly review the coal application plans of various production units in 1954, and transfer the domestic coal in the plan to the Coal Industry and Building Materials Company for supply.

### 反对浪费工业用煤

专栏：读者来信摘要

　　反对浪费工业用煤
    读者许先来信：东北地区许多地方国营企业违反国家规定，擅自把国家调拨的生产用煤用于取暖和炊事，造成很大浪费。根据东北区各省市煤业建筑器材公司的调查，仅一九五三年第一、二、三三个季度中，这样被挪用的煤即达二十三万余吨。辽东省第八造纸厂、营口造纸厂、营口第五纺织厂、营口卷烟厂、瓦房店纺织厂等五个工厂，就挪用生产用煤二万八千一百一十六吨。抚顺制钢厂、石油三厂、建筑材料一厂共挪用了一万一千七百三十四吨。辽西、松江等省也有类似情况。吉林省有四个单位不仅挪用了三千三百一十五吨生产用煤，而且把三千七百一十吨生产用煤，低价出售。地方国营食品公司从一月至九月，曾把生产用煤二百一十吨以每吨六万元的低价卖给职工和某职工浴池；地方国营火柴厂把生产用煤二百零四吨作为职工福利煤分配出去；陶瓷工厂把一千五百三十五吨生产用煤卖给市民；范家屯糖厂把二百吨西安原煤卖给职工。旅大市有二十二个单位的取暖用煤，全部按生产用煤向国家申请调拨。其中瓦斯公司不仅本单位把生产用煤用于取暖和炊事，还把生产用煤卖给交通公司和公用局。
    当前国家正在进行大规模的经济建设，煤，这是工业的粮食，工业用煤的需要量正在激增。浪费工业用煤，就会损害国家工业化的事业，这是不能容许的。建议东北财政经济委员会检查浪费工业用煤问题，对违法单位进行严肃处理，并要求各有关部门严格审查一九五四年各生产单位申请用煤的计划，将其中生活用煤从计划中划归煤业建筑器材公司供应。
