    Chinese Students in the Soviet Union
    By our reporter Bai Sheng
    Since 1951, the Central Higher Education Ministry has annually dispatched large numbers of students to various Soviet universities to study advanced Soviet science and technology, training them to become high-level construction personnel. Various central government departments and trade union systems have also selected a number of interns to go to Soviet industrial and mining enterprises to learn advanced Soviet experience in industrial and mining enterprise management, production technology, and other aspects.

    Chinese students in the Soviet Union are mainly distributed in institutions of higher learning and industrial and mining enterprises in thirteen cities, including Moscow, Leningrad, Kazan, Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Gorky. Among these students and graduate students, some study mining, metallurgy, petroleum, geology, electrical engineering, machinery, water conservancy, railways, shipping; some study physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics; and some study medicine, agriculture, finance and economics, political law, language, and history, with the largest number studying engineering.

    Recently, I interviewed several students who had just returned from the Soviet Union, and I read some letters sent by Chinese students from the Soviet Union. From their conversations and letters, it is evident that Chinese students in the Soviet Union are diligently studying.

    Every Chinese student studying in the Soviet Union believes that learning advanced Soviet science and technology and the theory and experience of socialist construction is a glorious task for each of them. They realize that their studies are closely linked to the socialist industrialization of the motherland and the happy lives of the people of the motherland.

    Many Chinese students who have been assigned to study at Moscow University have moved into the beautiful new school buildings built on the magnificent Lenin Hills. They all love it very much and feel honored and proud to be able to study at this university.

    In the early days of their arrival in the Soviet Union, many students encountered difficulties at the beginning of their studies because their Russian language skills were not good enough before going abroad, and because their basic courses, professional courses, and the foundations of Marxist-Leninist theory were weak. However, due to their strong confidence in learning and the warm help from Soviet teachers and students, many difficulties were overcome. Luo Zhentao is a student who recently returned to China. During her study in the Soviet Union, she went through a difficult period. As she herself said: "At the beginning of my studies, all kinds of difficulties pressed on me, making me very anxious. Soviet teachers and classmates encouraged me and helped me. They guided me in my studies as if they were caring for a child. The school also specially hired a teacher to teach me Russian... After more than two years of intensive study, I finally caught up with everyone and attended classes with Soviet students." Bi Kebao, a female student who was assigned to study architectural science at the Moscow Kuibyshev Institute of Civil Engineering, went to an architectural engineering exhibition with Soviet students when she first arrived in Moscow. An old professor explained to the students, but she could not understand most of it, and in her own words, "I only understood some of it by guessing." After the start of her studies, she went through tutoring and worked hard, improving her study methods. Soviet teachers constantly gave her encouragement and help, enabling her to gradually overcome various difficulties in her studies. Now, she has not only mastered Russian and is studying professional technical courses with Soviet students, but she has also made great progress in all aspects. In the summer vacation exam last year, all her grades were five points. Many other students studying in the Soviet Union, like Luo Zhentao and Bi Kebao, have overcome countless difficulties and achieved great results in their studies. This can be seen from the exam results of the winter vacation of 1952 and the summer vacation of 1953: the vast majority of students obtained excellent grades of five points. Some students have achieved remarkable results in their studies and have won praise from their teachers. Wang Guanghua, a graduate student assigned to study operations organization at the Moscow Stalin Railway Transportation Engineering Institute, has achieved excellent results. Based on the theory of the method of calculating train marshalling patterns by Soviet railway expert Professor Petrov, he put forward suggestions for simplifying the method of calculating train marshalling. His suggestions and arguments were praised by Soviet professors, especially Professor Petrov, who worked in the Soviet Ministry of Railways. Wang Guanghua also gave a report at the annual school-wide scientific and technological conference held at the Railway Transportation Engineering Institute. The conference decided to adopt this creative suggestion and recommend it to the General Administration of Transportation of the Soviet Ministry of Railways.

    Under the guidance of Soviet professors, many graduate students have begun research and writing of their dissertations. For example, Wang Jinjiang, a graduate student studying in the Department of Hygiene at the Second Moscow Medical Institute, is conducting research on the topic of "Hygienic Evaluation of Kindergarten Building Problems in Moscow." This will help improve kindergarten buildings in our country in the future. Currently, he has begun reading various literatures and collecting relevant information for research in the Lenin Library in Moscow, the Soviet Central Medical Library, and the Library of the Academy of Architecture. He will select about twenty kindergartens in Moscow for a general hygiene survey, and then select three or five of them for detailed investigation and research. In addition, he will refer to the work experience and plans of Moscow health agencies (such as health and epidemic prevention stations, school health stations) for analysis and research. Chinese interns in Soviet industrial and mining enterprises are also studying advanced operating methods and technologies intensively and seriously. Under the guidance of Soviet technicians, they have formulated specific internship plans in conjunction with each person's internship tasks. Factory and mine leaders have also hired experts to give them supplementary professional theoretical courses. In the workshops where they intern, Soviet workers and technicians often patiently and enthusiastically explain various technologies and operating experience to them, so that they can quickly master the technology. For example, an old technician named Guo Luowachev once explained a technical operation problem to Chinese interns. After he explained it, he was afraid that the students would not understand it, so the next day he hurried to them and re-explained it. A technician in a factory in Moscow, who was wounded in the Soviet Patriotic War and only had one leg, often led Chinese interns around the workshop, guiding their internships.

    Chinese interns have achieved excellent results in their studies in the Soviet Union, and many have quickly mastered certain advanced operating methods and technologies. Zhao Gansong, a Chinese intern who interned in a chemical factory in Ukraine and recently returned to China, put forward a rationalization proposal in June 1952 during his factory internship to simplify the manufacturing process of green indanthrene dyes, which was rewarded by the factory. Every Chinese student deeply feels the care and love that Soviet schools and factories have for them. Chinese students who recently returned to China all said that during their studies in the Soviet Union, everyone felt infinite warmth and joy in their hearts; when they encountered difficulties, Soviet comrades came to help and encourage them; when they achieved excellent results in their studies, Soviet comrades were also happy for them. Soviet comrades treated them like their own brothers. In order to enable Chinese students to study better, Soviet universities arranged a very perfect learning environment and the necessary learning conditions for them. Each school has well-equipped laboratories, reading rooms, and libraries with a rich collection of various professional books for them to conduct experiments and research. During the holidays, trade unions and youth leagues in the schools often organize them to visit and tour Soviet places of interest, or watch famous ballets and movies, or go to scenic spots for recuperation. Various institutions of higher learning also specially hired Russian teachers to teach Chinese students Russian; and assigned Soviet students to live with them, so that they can better use Russian in life and study. Every old professor in the Soviet Union is always concerned about the growth of the younger generation. Soviet teachers' care for Chinese students is even more meticulous. Each teacher often talks to the graduate students he or she leads to understand their learning situation and jointly discuss and formulate study plans. Teachers try their best to allow them to participate in certain relevant academic seminars. Feng Kang, a graduate student who recently returned to China, said: "My tutor, Bondriagin, is a famous Soviet geometer and a corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Although he is blind, he still conducts research tirelessly and guides young people to study very seriously; he is especially concerned and loves Chinese students." The fact that Chinese students study all day and do not like sports has attracted the attention of Soviet comrades, who have put forward their opinions with concern. A Soviet comrade said: "Chinese students are too diligent and do not like to play; they even hold their vocabulary books to read while eating. Unless you snatch his books and notebooks, he will be willing to go to the movies with you." This comment points out the strengths of Chinese students, but also points out their weaknesses, because Soviet students not only love their majors and philosophy, but also have a wide range of interests. Almost everyone can fluently recite the poems of Pushkin and Mayakovsky, can talk with you about the famous music of Tchaikovsky and Beethoven, as well as the literary works of the world's great writers. They are also good at managing their own lives: they play heartily when they play, study hard when they study, and work diligently when they work.

      Every student in the Soviet Union misses the motherland all the time, and every new achievement in the motherland's economic construction is a force that encourages them to study. Whenever they receive newspapers and periodicals sent from the motherland, they rush to read them, looking for news of the motherland's construction. A student said in a letter to a friend: "Not a day goes by that we don't talk about our dear motherland. When we encounter difficulties in our studies, as long as we think of the expectations of the people of the motherland, we immediately feel a force encouraging us to move forward." (Attached picture)

    我国留学生在苏联
    本报记者　柏生
    从一九五一年开始，中央高等教育部年年派遣大批留学生到苏联各大学，学习苏联先进的科学技术，把他们培养成为高级建设人材。中央各业务部门和工会系统还选派了一部分实习生，到苏联各工矿企业，学习苏联在工矿企业管理、生产技术等方面的先进经验。
    在苏联的我国留学生，主要分布在莫斯科、列宁格勒、喀山、基辅、哈尔科夫、高尔基城等十三个城市的高等学校和工矿企业部门中。在这些留学的大学生和研究生中，有的学采矿、冶金、石油、地质、电机、机械、水利、铁路、航运，有的学物理、化学、生物、数学，有的学医学、农业、财经和政治法律、语言、历史等科学，其中以学工科的人数为最多。
    最近，我访问了刚由苏联归国的几位留学生，并读到了一部分我国留学生由苏联寄来的信。从他们的谈话和来信中，可以看出我国留学生在苏联努力学习的情形。
    在苏联学习的每一个中国同学都认为，学习苏联先进的科学技术与社会主义建设的理论和经验，是他们每一个人的光荣任务。他们认识到，自己的学习是和祖国社会主义工业化、祖国人民的幸福生活密切联系着的。
    许多被分配到莫斯科大学去学习的我国留学生，都已搬进建筑在雄伟的列宁山上的美丽的新校舍。他们都非常喜爱它，以自己能进这个大学学习而感到光荣和骄傲。
    在刚到苏联的日子里，许多同学因为在出国前俄文学习得不够好，加上基础课、专业课以及马克思列宁主义理论的基础差，他们在开始学习时曾碰到不少的困难。但是，由于他们具有坚强的学习信心，和得到苏联教师、同学的亲切帮助，许多困难都被克服了。罗镇涛是最近回国的一位留学生。在她留学苏联的期间，曾走过一段艰苦的道路。正如她自己所说的：“开始学习时，种种困难紧压着我，使我非常心焦。苏联教师和同学便鼓励我，帮助我。他们像关心孩子似地指导我学习。学校方面还专门请了一位教师，教我学俄文……。经过了二年多的紧张学习，我终于赶上了大家，和苏联同学一起上课。”毕可宝，一个被分配在莫斯科古比雪夫建筑工程学院学建筑科学的女同学，在她刚到莫斯科时，曾和苏联同学一起去看一个建筑工程展览会，一位老教授给同学们讲解，但她却大部分听不懂，用她自己的话来说，“只是连猜带虎地弄懂了一些”。学习开始以后，她曾进行了补习，并努力钻研，改进学习方法，而苏联教师则不断地给她鼓励和帮助，使她逐渐克服了学习上的种种困难。现在，她不仅掌握了俄文，和苏联同学在一起学习着专业技术课程，而且在各方面都有了很大的进步。去年暑假考试，她的成绩全部是五分。在苏联留学的其他许多同学，也和罗镇涛、毕可宝一样，在学习中克服了无数的困难，获得很大成绩。这可以从一九五二年寒假和一九五三年暑假的考试成绩中看出：绝大部分同学都获得了五分的优秀成绩。有些同学在学习中成绩显著，获得了教师的好评。分配在莫斯科斯大林铁路运输工程学院运转组织专业学习的研究生王光华，成绩很优秀，他根据苏联铁路专家彼得罗夫教授的编组列车的图案计算方法的理论，提出了简化编组列车计算方法的建议。他的建议和论点受到了苏联教授，特别是在苏联铁道部工作的彼得罗夫教授的赞扬。王光华并在铁路运输工程学院举行的一年一次的全校科学技术会议上作了报告。会议决定采纳这个创造性的建议，并把它推荐给苏联铁道部运输总局。
    在苏联教授的指导下，许多研究生已开始了论文的研究和写作工作。例如，在莫斯科第二医学院卫生科学习的研究生王锦江，以“关于莫斯科市幼儿园建筑问题的卫生评价”为题进行着研究。这对我国将来改进幼儿园建筑是有帮助的。目前，他已开始阅读各种文献，并在莫斯科列宁图书馆、苏联中央医学图书馆及建筑科学院图书馆内收集有关资料来研究。他选择莫斯科市二十所左右的幼儿园，先做一般的卫生调查，然后再选择其中的三、五所进行详细的调查和研究。此外，并将参考莫斯科市卫生机关（如卫生防疫站、学校卫生站）的工作经验和计划进行分析研究。在苏联各工矿企业中的我国实习生，也都在紧张地、认真地学习着先进的操作法和技术。他们在苏联技术人员的指导下，结合每个人的实习任务，制订了具体的实习计划。厂矿领导方面还聘请了专家，给他们补习各种专业理论课程。在实习的车间中，苏联工人和技术人员经常耐心地热情地给他们讲解各种技术和操作经验，使他们很快地掌握技术。例如，一个叫做郭罗瓦切夫的老技术工人，有一次给我国实习生讲解一个技术操作上的问题，他讲后怕同学还不了解，第二天他又急忙到他们那里，重新讲了一遍。莫斯科某工厂有一个技术员，曾在苏联卫国战争中负了伤，只有一条腿，他经常领导我国实习生在车间到处走动，指导实习。
    我国实习生在苏联学习的成绩非常优秀，有不少人很快地掌握了某些先进的操作法和技术。曾经在乌克兰某化学工厂实习、最近刚归国的我国实习生赵淦松，一九五二年六月在工厂实习中，提出了简化绿色阴丹士林染料制造程序的合理化建议，受到工厂方面的奖励。每一个我国留学生都深深地感到苏联学校和工厂对他们的关怀和爱护。最近归国的我国留学生都谈到，在苏联学习的日子里，大家心里感到无限的温暖和愉快；有了困难，苏联同志就来帮助你，鼓励你；当你在学习中取得优秀成绩时，苏联同志也为你感到高兴。苏联同志像对待自己的亲兄弟一样对待他们。苏联各高等学校为了使我国留学生学习得更好，给他们安排了非常完美的学习环境，和必要的学习条件。每个学校里都有设备完善的实验室、阅览室和藏书丰富的各种专业图书馆，供他们进行实验和研究。学校中的工会和青年团，在假期中经常组织他们去游览和参观苏联各名胜古迹，或看著名的舞剧和电影，或到风景区休养。各高等学校，还特别聘请了俄文教师，教我国同学学习俄文；并分配苏联同学和他们住在一起，使他们在生活和学习中能更好地运用俄文。苏联的每一个老教授时刻关切着年青一代的成长。对我国留学生，苏联教师的关怀更是无微不至。每一个教师时常跟他所领导的研究生进行谈话，了解他们的学习情况，共同商量制订学习计划。对某些有关的学术讨论会，教师们都是尽量设法让他们参加。最近归国的研究生冯康说：“我的导师邦德里亚金，是苏联一位著名的几何学家，苏联科学院的通讯院士。他虽然双目已失明，仍然不倦地进行着研究，非常认真地指导青年学习；对中国留学生，他更是特别关怀和爱护。”我国同学整天念书，不喜欢运动的情况，引起了苏联同志的注意，并关心地提出了意见。有一个苏联同志说：“中国同学太用功，也太不爱玩；吃饭时，都要拿着生字本念。除非你把他的书和本子抢过来，他才肯和你一同去看电影。”这个评语一方面指出了我国同学的长处，也指出了他们的缺点，因为苏联同学不仅热爱自己所学的专业，爱好哲学，而且还有着广泛的兴趣。他们几乎每个人都能很流畅地背诵普希金、马雅可夫斯基的诗句，能和你畅谈柴可夫斯基、贝多芬的著名乐曲，以及世界伟大作家们的文学著作。他们还善于处理自己的生活：玩的时候就尽情地玩，学习的时候努力学习，工作时踏实地工作。
      在苏联的每一个留学生无时不在怀念着祖国，祖国在经济建设上的每一个新的成就，都是鼓舞他们学习的力量。每当收到祖国寄去的报纸、刊物时，他们都争先恐后地抢着阅读，从里面寻找着祖国建设的消息。有一个同学在写给朋友的信中说：“我们没有一天不在谈论着亲爱的祖国，当我们在学习中遇到困难时，只要一想到祖国人民的期望，我们立刻就感到有一股力量在鼓舞着我们前进。”（附图片）
