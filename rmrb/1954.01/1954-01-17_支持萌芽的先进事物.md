    Supporting Budding Advanced Things

    To be adept at discovering advanced things budding from the workers in their production activities, and to promptly present them to the readers, advocating and promoting them, is an important task of our newspaper's economic propaganda. The "Communique on Rotating Technical Demonstrations and General Inspection of Operations" and the short commentary "Helping Workers Summarize Production Experience," published by the Liaodong Masses Daily on December 20th last year, are examples of the newspaper providing strong support for the advanced initiatives of the workers. In the communique and short commentary, the newspaper detailed the method of the Li Hua group of the wood core box workshop of the Liaodong Match Factory, where workers learned from each other, improved operating methods, and achieved a general increase in labor productivity.

    In the Liaodong area, as in some other areas, due to objective limitations, the entire production process or parts of the production process in some industries (such as silk reeling, winemaking, and oil pressing) still need to be carried out manually. The characteristics of this production method are: non-uniform operation methods, with each worker operating according to his own habits. Some workers are good at research, and their operating methods are more reasonable, resulting in higher production efficiency; some workers are accustomed to old operating methods, resulting in lower production efficiency. The situation of the Li Hua group in the wood core box workshop of the Liaodong Match Factory was also like this. Due to the inconsistency of operating methods and low technical level, the group often failed to complete the production plan evenly. Last November, when the Li Hua group faced the danger of being unable to complete the plan, under the initiative of Li Minglan, the head of the trade union group, they absorbed the experience of the Han Fuhui group of the Andong Cigarette Factory, and adopted the method of "rotating technical demonstrations and general inspection of operations" to improve technology, which changed the situation of not being able to complete the plan. The method of general inspection of operations is that one person demonstrates, and the others help to check, point out the advantages and disadvantages, and learn from each other and improve. This allows various different operating methods to be improved through learning from each other's strengths and making up for weaknesses, and discarding the crude and retaining the refined, becoming more advanced operating methods.

    After the Li Hua group adopted advanced operating methods, the overall operating technical level of the entire group was generally improved, effectively promoting production. For example, Li Jinlian, a member of the group, after this demonstration and everyone's inspection, removed the redundant action of combing the board and quickly improved from an average of 28 boards per day to 30 boards. After the technical demonstration and mutual inspection of other workers in the group, the production efficiency was also generally improved. In November, the entire group overfulfilled the production plan. The average daily output of boards per person increased by two to three boards compared to the past. In early December, not only did the output exceed the plan, but the quality also increased from 99.41% to 99.55%, thereby overcoming the past phenomenon of uneven production and increased labor intensity to complete the production plan.

    The experience of the Li Hua group initially proves that the practice of "rotating technical demonstrations and general inspection of operations" is an effective leadership method and working method for mobilizing the masses of workers to use the spirit of criticism and self-criticism to summarize experience and improve production technology. The Liaodong Masses Daily advocated and promoted this budding but advanced working method, which effectively supported the growth of newborn and budding things. (Wan Chun)

### 支持萌芽的先进事物

    支持萌芽的先进事物
    善于发现工人群众在生产活动中萌芽的先进事物，及时地把它提到读者面前来，加以提倡和推广，是我们报纸经济宣传的一项重要任务。去年十二月二十日辽东大众报发表的“轮流表演技术，大家检查操作”的通讯和“帮助工人总结生产经验”的短评，就是报纸对工人群众中的先进倡议给予有力支持的一个例子。在通讯和短评中，报纸详细地介绍了辽东火柴厂梗箱车间理板工序李华小组互相学习，改进操作方法，达到普遍提高劳动生产率的作法。
    在辽东地区，也和其他某些地区一样，由于客观条件的限制，目前某些工业（像缫丝、酿酒、制油等行业）的整个生产过程或部分生产过程，仍然需要采用手工方式进行生产。这种生产方式的特点是：操作方法不统一，每个工人都按照自己的习惯进行操作。有些工人善于钻研，操作方法比较合理，生产效率就较高；有些工人习惯于旧的操作方法，生产效率就较低。辽东火柴厂梗箱车间理板工序李华小组的情况也是这样。该组由于操作方法不统一，技术水平不高，常常不能均衡地完成生产计划。去年十一月间当李华小组面临着无法完成计划的危险时，在工会小组长李明兰的倡议下，吸取了安东市卷烟厂韩福慧小组的经验，采用“轮流表演技术，大家检查操作”的办法来提高技术，就改变了完不成计划的情况。大家检查操作的方法是由一人表演，其余的人帮助检查，指出优缺点，互相学习和改进。这就使各种不同的操作方法，经过取长补短、去粗取精，成为比较先进的操作方法。
    李华小组采用先进操作法后，全组的操作技术水平普遍提高，有效地推进了生产。如组员李金莲，经过这次表演和大家的检查，去除了理板时多余的一遍动作后，她就很快从每天平均理二十八条板提高到三十条。该组其他工人经过技术表演和互相检查后，生产效率也普遍地提高了。十一月份全组超额完成了生产计划。每人理板的平均日产量较过去增加了两条至三条。十二月上旬，不但产量超过了计划，质量也由百分之九十九点四一提高到百分之九十九点五五，从而克服了过去生产不均衡和增强劳动强度来完成生产计划的现象。
    李华小组的经验初步证明，“轮流表演技术，大家检查操作”的作法，是发动工人群众用批评和自我批评的精神来总结经验，改进生产技术的行之有效的领导方法和工作方法。辽东大众报把这种萌芽的但是先进的工作方法，予以提倡和推广，这就有效地支持了新生的萌芽的事物的成长。　（万春）
