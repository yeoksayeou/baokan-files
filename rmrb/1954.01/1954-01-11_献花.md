    Offering Flowers
    Li Ying
    The grave of a志愿军 soldier, rises beside the mountain road.
    What buries this soldier is as if not yellow earth, but waves of fresh flowers.
    This grave is covered with flowers and plants all year round,
    This grave exudes fragrance in all seasons.
    The spring breeze gently blows, and the flowers flutter in the wind,
    The snow falls heavily, and the flowers bloom in the snow.
    Where do so many flowers come from?
    And blooming in so many varieties.
    Where do such good flower seeds come from?
    Never wither all year round.
    This is a secluded mountain valley road,
    A little girl walks here every day.
    She goes to school and offers a handful of flowers she picked,
    After school, she replaces them with newly picked flowers.
    She doesn't know the name of this martyr,
    Nor does she know the year and place of his sacrifice,
    But she knows that he is a志愿军 soldier,
    He gave his life for her liberation.
    You don't have to ask this child's name,
    She is an ordinary Korean girl,
    You see her piously holding the flowers to her chest,
    That bouquet is like being picked from her pure heart.
            December 1953 in Korea

    献花
    李瑛一个志愿军战士的坟墓，隆起在靠山的路旁。掩埋这战士的仿佛不是黄土，而是一层层鲜花的波浪。这坟墓长年被花草遮蔽，这坟墓四季散发着清香。春风拂拂，花儿迎风飘动，大雪纷纷，花儿冒雪开放。哪里来这样多的花朵？还开得那么多种多样。哪里来这样好的花种？一年四季永不凋谢。这儿是一条僻静的山谷路，这儿天天走着一位小姑娘，她上学去把采来的花献上一把，她放学后又把刚摘的花重新换上。她不知道这牺牲者的名字，也不晓得他牺牲的年月和地方，但她知道他是一个志愿军战士，他献出生命就是为了她的解放。你不必问这孩子的名字，她是一个普通的朝鲜姑娘，你看她虔诚地把花捧在胸前，那花束就像摘自她纯真的心上。
