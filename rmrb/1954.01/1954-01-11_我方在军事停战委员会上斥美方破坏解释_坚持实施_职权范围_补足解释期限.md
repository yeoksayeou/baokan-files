Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 10th:

    The Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on January 10th.

    Chief Korean-Chinese delegate, General Li Sang-cho, pointed out at the meeting: The "Interim Report" submitted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to both sides on December 28, 1953, unequivocally affirmed the ugly facts that the US side, through special agent organizations, used violence to control the Dongchang-ri POW camp, undermined the interpretation work, obstructed the repatriation of prisoners of war, and seriously undermined the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The US side had a "complex and complete" special agent organization planned among the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, maintained contact with the special agent organization through various illegal means, and directly directed it. The US headquarters that controlled the entire Dongchang-ri POW camp special agent organization was in Seoul and was controlled by the Commander of the South Korean Gendarmerie. The US 64th Field Hospital constituted the most important link in this illegal connection. The US special agent organization used barbaric and cruel violence against prisoners of war who were willing to exercise their right to repatriation, and repeatedly murdered prisoners of war who were willing to be repatriated. Not a single prisoner of war in the Dongchang-ri POW camp dared to publicly demand repatriation. The US special agent organization had planned from the beginning to undermine the interpretation work, refused to allow prisoners of war to listen to the interpretation, and carried out sabotage and obstruction in the interpretation tents in a planned and organized manner. This sabotage activity of the US special agent organization was closely related and coordinated with the obstructive attitude adopted by the US side towards the interpretation work. The US side even placed the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission "under the rule of US threats and intimidation," preventing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from taking effective measures to stop the US special agent activities to ensure the interpretation work could proceed. Due to the US side's delay in the construction of interpretation facilities, and due to the obstruction and sabotage activities of the US special agent organization, the Korean-Chinese side's interpretation work could only be carried out for ten days, and more than 85% of the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war had not been able to listen to the interpretation at all. The "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" irrefutably established the US side's responsibility for seriously undermining the implementation of the armistice agreement regarding interpretation work and the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war.

    General Li Sang-cho continued: The armistice agreement's "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" clearly stipulates, in order to implement its basic goal of ensuring that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation, the lifting of control and influence of the original detaining side over the prisoners of war, the carrying out of ninety days of interpretation for the prisoners of war, and the submission to the political conference within thirty days the issue of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation after the ninety days of interpretation work has been carried out. The US side not only continued to control the POW camps through special agent organizations, not only delayed and obstructed the interpretation work, so that the vast majority of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war have not been able to listen to the interpretation, but also created unreasonable excuses, and has planned to interrupt the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference, so that the political conference cannot be convened quickly to deal with the issue of prisoners of war. The US side is clearly attempting to use this to realize the US side's consistent conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. However, the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" must be implemented, and the US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war must not be allowed to be realized. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has pointed out in its "Interim Report" and its letter to both sides on January 2nd that the interpretation should be continued, the extension of the interpretation period is legal and necessary, and the submission of the issue of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation to the political conference is a mandatory provision. The US side must immediately stop directing special agents to carry out sabotage activities. The interpretation time must be made up to ninety days, and after the ninety-day period is made up, the prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation must continue to be guarded by the Indian Custodial Forces of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, pending the political conference to deal with them within thirty days after it is convened. The US side's criminal behavior of undermining the "Terms of Reference" has been condemned by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and all righteous people in the world, and the Korean-Chinese side will never allow the US side to continue to undermine the "Terms of Reference," to coerce and obstruct the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces from exercising their legitimate powers to realize the despicable conspiracy of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

    The US side was unable to deny the above-mentioned facts of its serious undermining of the armistice agreement and its attempt to forcibly detain prisoners of war at the meeting, and had to resort to the trick of "avoiding talking about it," only claiming that US Commander Hull had expressed his views on the issue of prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    General Li Sang-cho immediately pointed out: In his letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the US commander unreasonably opposed the commission's fair propositions that the interpretation should be continued, the extension of the interpretation period is reasonable and necessary, and the submission of the issue of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation to the political conference is a mandatory provision of the "Terms of Reference." The "Terms of Reference" have not been implemented to this day due to the US side's sabotage, and the US side has no reason and no right to oppose the fair propositions put forward by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in order to realize the basic goal of the "Terms of Reference." The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has the responsibility to ensure the implementation of the "Terms of Reference," and the "Terms of Reference" also empower the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with all the power to interpret and implement the "Terms of Reference," and the fair propositions made by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for this purpose must not be denied by the US side.

### 我方在军事停战委员会上斥美方破坏解释  坚持实施“职权范围”补足解释期限

    我方在军事停战委员会上斥美方破坏解释
    坚持实施“职权范围”补足解释期限
    【新华社开城十日电】军事停战委员会一月十日举行会议。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在会上指出：一九五三年十二月二十八日中立国遣返委员会提交双方的“临时报告”，明确无疑地肯定了美方通过特务组织以暴力控制东场里战俘营、破坏解释工作、阻挠战俘遣返、严重破坏朝鲜停战协定的实施的丑恶事实。美方有计划地在朝中被俘人员中布置了“复杂而完整”的特务组织，通过各种非法途径保持与特务组织的联系，并直接加以指挥。控制了整个东场里战俘营特务组织的美方总部就在汉城，受南朝鲜宪兵总司令官的控制。美军第六十四野战医院在这种非法的联系中构成了最重要的一环。美方的特务组织对愿意行使遣返权利的战俘施用野蛮残酷的暴力行为，多次凶杀愿意遣返的战俘。东场里战俘营中没有一个战俘敢于公开要求遣返。美方特务组织自始即有计划地破坏解释工作，拒绝使战俘听取解释，并在解释帐篷中以有计划、有组织的行动进行破坏和阻挠。美方特务组织的这种破坏活动，与美方对解释工作所采取的阻挠态度有密切的联系和配合。美方更将中立国遣返委员会置于美方“威胁与恐吓的统治之下”，阻挠中立国遣返委员会采取有效措施制止美方的特务活动以保证解释工作的进行。由于美方拖延解释设备的修建，并由于美方特务组织的阻挠和破坏活动，朝中方面的解释工作仅能进行了十天，百分之八十五以上的朝中被俘人员根本未能听取解释。“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”不可动摇地确定了美方严重破坏停战协定中有关解释工作和战俘遣返协议的实施的责任。
    李相朝中将继指出：停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”为实施其保证一切战俘有机会行使遣返权利的基本目标，明确规定解除原拘留一方对战俘的控制与影响，对战俘进行九十天的解释，而在九十天解释工作进行之后尚未行使其遣返权利的战俘的问题则交由政治会议在三十天内加以处理。美方不但通过特务组织继续控制战俘营，不但拖延、阻挠解释工作，使绝大部分的朝中被俘人员尚未能听取解释，而且制造毫无道理的借口，有计划地中断了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，使政治会议不能迅速召开以处理战俘问题。美方显然企图借此实现美方强迫扣留战俘的一贯阴谋。但“职权范围”的规定必须予以实施，美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋决不容许其实现。中立国遣返委员会在其“临时报告”和一月二日致双方函件中业已指出：解释应予继续，解释期限的延长是合法的和必要的，尚未行使遣返权利的战俘问题之提交政治会议是有强制性的规定。美方必须立即停止指挥特务进行破坏活动。解释时间必须补足九十天，九十天的期限补足后尚未行使遣返权利的战俘必须由中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队继续看管，以待政治会议在召开后的三十天内加以处理。美方破坏“职权范围”的罪恶行为已经遭受到中立国遣返委员会和全世界正义人类的谴责，朝中方面将决不容许美方继续破坏“职权范围”，胁迫并阻挠中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队行使其合法职权以实现强迫扣留战俘的卑鄙阴谋。
    美方在会上无法否认其严重破坏停战协定、力图强迫扣留战俘的上述各项事实，只好采取“避而不谈”的伎俩，仅称美方司令官赫尔已就战俘问题向中立国遣返委员会表示了意见。
    李相朝中将当即指出：美方司令官在给中立国遣返委员会的信中，曾无理地反对该委员会关于解释应予继续、解释期限的延长是合理的和必要的、以及尚未行使遣返权利的战俘问题之提交政治会议处理是“职权范围”的强制性规定等公正主张。“职权范围”既已由于美方的破坏而至今未能实施，美方更没有任何理由也没有任何权利反对中立国遣返委员会为实现“职权范围”的基本目标所提出的那些公正主张。中立国遣返委员会有保证“职权范围”的实施之责任，“职权范围”也赋予了中立国遣返委员会以解释与实施“职权范围”的一切权力，中立国遣返委员会为此而作出的公正主张，决不容许美方予以否定。
