Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 23rd: Our correspondent reports: After forcibly detaining over 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles boasted about a "just" "victory." Dulles's self-praise cannot conceal America's political and moral bankruptcy caused by the forced detention of prisoners of war, nor can it make the people of the world forget the shocking and barbaric atrocities in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps in the past three years. The people will not forget all this, and the executioners cannot wash it away.

The U.S. government's policy of forcibly detaining prisoners of war was originally intended to use the prisoner-of-war issue to achieve a so-called "psychological warfare" victory, in order to cover up the failure of the U.S. aggression against Korea. America's "Saturday Evening Post" said on November 1, 1952, that after the U.S. Army Psychological Warfare Bureau carried out a series of espionage activities in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, it submitted its plan for the forced detention of prisoners of war to the military authorities about a week before the start of the armistice negotiations, suggesting that a decision be made immediately, pointing out that "whatever our position, it will inevitably become a factor in psychological warfare." This suggestion later became the policy of the U.S. government. This policy was brought to the armistice negotiation table and became the so-called "principle of voluntary repatriation." The U.S. ruling clique and its kept press later made no secret of the fact that the U.S. wanted to use the prisoner-of-war issue as a magic weapon for "psychological warfare." The "New York Times" published an article by columnist Baldwin on March 21, 1952, which said: If the U.S. side agrees to the Korean and Chinese side's request to repatriate all prisoners of war, "then we are automatically destroying one of our greatest psychological warfare weapons."

The U.S. government's so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle was criticized by world opinion as soon as it was put forward. Even British and American public opinion believed that this was not allowed by international law. On April 3, 1952, Britain's "Foreign Affairs Report" said, "The refusal to repatriate all prisoners of war may be interpreted as a violation of the (Geneva) Convention" and "creates an ugly precedent." Walter Lippmann, a reactionary commentator for the "New York Herald Tribune," bluntly admitted on February 28, 1952, that "we are legally untenable under the Geneva Convention, which we have worked hard to draft."

The U.S. government's ugly practice of using Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang secret agents in prisoner-of-war camps to force prisoners of war to "refuse repatriation" made the world see clearly that the U.S. government's "humanitarian" signboard was originally painted with the blood of prisoners of war. Journalists from the United States, Britain, Canada, and other countries have constantly revealed in their reports the situation of the U.S. side manufacturing prisoners of war who "refuse repatriation." Especially after the Dodd incident occurred on Koje Island in May 1952, the myth that prisoners of war "would rather commit suicide than be repatriated" was shattered. This incident caused widespread comments in the capitalist world, and many American newspapers pointed out that the atrocities on Koje Island caused the United States to "lose prestige" in the world. The "Christian Science Monitor" complained: "The Dodd incident exposed the unsightly situation inside the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp." The editor of the British newspaper "Reynold's News" published an article on May 18, 1952, saying: The events on Koje Island "have certainly begun to make the American story and the American screening methods stink." "As I see it, the position we are now taking is based on bad law, dubious humanitarianism, and dubious facts." "After the Dodd and Colson incidents, people will no longer believe the American claim that prisoners of war do not want to return to their homeland." The British weekly "New Statesman and Nation" said: Given the existence of Kuomintang secret agents in prisoner-of-war camps, "Therefore, there are serious reasons to ask whether the refusal of tens of thousands of prisoners of war to repatriate is as pure as Lieutenant General Choy's moral principles indicate. ... If prisoners of war have been forced to refuse repatriation, as long as the prisoner-of-war camp remains under its current control, prisoners of war will not easily admit their opinions to any impartial supervisory group that only makes temporary visits." The facts in Tongchang-ri later fully proved the correctness of this conclusion.

Because they were afraid that the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war would demand to go home, and also because they were afraid that the world would see through the U.S. side's lie that prisoners of war "refused repatriation," the United States successively detained 65,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war before the Korean armistice.

After more than 20,000 prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the U.S. government tried its best to obstruct the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides. Through the Tongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp, which was strictly controlled by secret agents, it continued to sell the lie that prisoners of war "would rather commit suicide than be repatriated" to the world. But the world clearly saw in Tongchang-ri the cruel and barbaric means by which secret agents under the command of the U.S. side prevented prisoners of war from being repatriated, and how prisoners of war risked their lives to escape and demand repatriation.

Since its establishment, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has repeatedly issued statements and documents, affirming that the U.S. side used pre-arranged secret agents to use violence and threats of violence against prisoners of war to obstruct repatriation, and confirming that the U.S. side has consistently used various methods to undermine the explanation work and the implementation of the provisions of the "Terms of Reference." In its concluding "Interim Report," the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission said: "Prisoners of war did not enjoy the freedom to seek repatriation while in the camps and were under the threat of force or violence," and even prisoners of war who had been explained were not exempt from the force or threats of violence from secret agent organizations, "Acts of violence were used against those who were willing to exercise the right to repatriation." Because these well-known facts are undeniable, the U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" had to say in a commentary on January 2 this year when commenting on the report released by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission: "Although this matter has frustrated the propaganda of the Allies, it is difficult to deny the possibility that at least some of these accusations are true. Even the cautiously worded reports of the two minority countries, Switzerland and Sweden, have added to the truthfulness of these accusations."

The situation in the Tongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp aroused the righteous indignation of peace-loving people all over the world, especially in Asia. At a press conference in New Delhi on October 12 last year, Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, said:
  "Indian newspaper reporters have recently revealed some facts showing that prisoners of war were forced to tattoo words on their bodies, and that there were horrific massacres in prisoner-of-war camps controlled by the U.S. military. Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who wanted to be repatriated were brutally tortured. These facts have deeply shocked our country." Kitchlew said that the crimes of the U.S. side in the prisoner-of-war camps were "more terrifying and more barbaric many times over" than the crimes of the Hitler gang. The Indian "Free Press" pointed out in its editorial on October 10 last year: "In order to sabotage the Korean armistice, the U.S. side openly obstructed all arrangements for explanation work, the repatriation of prisoners of war, and the progress of the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The five countries of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have all seen this with their own eyes, and the whole world has begun to understand this." The "Pakistan Times" condemned the U.S. side for directing secret agents to control prisoners of war with violence and sabotage the explanation in an editorial published on November 7 last year. The editorial said that the U.S. side's crude attempt to obstruct the explanation work from the beginning shocked even the most cautious neutral observers. The British "Manchester Guardian" regretted the repercussions caused by the notorious U.S. secret agent rule in Tongchang-ri in Asian public opinion in a commentary on November 7 last year. The commentary said: "Undoubtedly, the general impression in Asia is that" the "terror and torture" among the prisoners of war have made it "dangerous for prisoners of war to choose to go home."

America's "psychological warfare" has completely failed. They don't even dare to mention the lies they invented, such as "voluntary repatriation" and prisoners of war "would rather commit suicide than go home." The whole world can clearly imagine the scenes in the Koje Island, Jeju Island, and Busan prisoner-of-war camps from Tongchang-ri. The barbarity and cruelty of the U.S. aggressors far exceeded their predecessors, the German fascists, and no one doubts this now. Since the judgment of human justice has not let go of the German fascists, it will certainly not let go of the U.S. aggressors, who are even more vicious than the German fascists.

### 美国的“心理战”彻底失败了

    美国的“心理战”彻底失败了
    【新华社开城二十三日电】本社特派记者报道：在强迫扣留了二万多名朝中被俘人员以后，美国国务卿杜勒斯又吹嘘什么“正义”的“胜利”了。杜勒斯的自我吹嘘不能掩盖美国由于强迫扣留战俘而遭到的政治上和道义上的破产，也不能使全世界人民就此忘记在过去三年之中美方战俘营里的骇人听闻的野蛮的暴行。这一切是人民所忘不了的，也是刽子手所洗刷不了的。
    美国政府定下强迫扣留战俘的政策，本来的目的是企图利用战俘问题来取得所谓“心理战”的胜利，借以为美国侵略朝鲜的失败遮羞。美国的“星期六晚邮报”在一九五二年十一月一日说，美国陆军心理作战局在美方战俘营中进行了一系列的特务活动以后，在停战谈判开始前一星期左右，向军事首脑当局提出了它的强迫扣留战俘的计划，建议立即作出决定，其中指出，“我们的立场不管是什么，都将不可避免地成为心理战上的一个因素”。这一建议后来就成为美国政府的政策。这个政策拿到停战谈判桌上就变成了所谓“自愿遣返的原则”。美国统治集团及其御用报刊在后来毫不掩饰美国要拿战俘问题当作“心理战”的法宝。“纽约时报”一九五二年三月二十一日发表专栏作家鲍德温的一篇文章中就说：如果美方同意朝中方面遣返全部战俘的要求，“那么我们就是自动毁坏了我们一个最大的心理作战武器”。
    美国政府的所谓“自愿遣返”原则一拿出来就遭到世界舆论的责难。就是英、美的舆论也认为这是国际公法所不能容许的。一九五二年四月三日英国的“外事报道”说，“拒绝遣返一切战俘之举可能被解释成为破坏（日内瓦）公约”，并“创造一个丑恶的先例”。“纽约先驱论坛报”反动评论员李普曼在一九五二年二月二十八日直截了当地承认，“根据我们曾经努力参加起草的日内瓦公约，我们在法律上是站不住脚的。”
    美国政府在战俘营里利用李承晚、国民党特务强迫战俘“拒绝遣返”的一套丑恶做法，使全世界看清楚了美国政府的“人道主义”招牌，原来是用战俘的鲜血漆成的。美国、英国、加拿大等国家的记者，在他们的报道中不断透露了美方制造“拒绝遣返”的战俘的情形。特别在一九五二年五月巨济岛上发生了杜德事件以后，所谓战俘“宁愿自杀也不愿遣返”的神话就从此破产了。这个事件在资本主义世界中引起了广泛的评论，许多美国报刊都指出，巨济岛上的暴行使美国在全世界“丧失了威信”。“时代先驱报”埋怨说：“杜德事件暴露了巨济岛战俘营内部的不体面情况。”英国报纸“雷诺新闻”的编者在一九五二年五月十八日发表文章说：巨济岛上的事件“使美国的说法和美国的甄别方法确实开始臭气薰天起来”。“据我看来，我们现在所采取的立场是根据着坏的法律、可疑的人道主义和可疑的事实的”。“杜德与柯尔生事件发生以后，人们不会再相信美国所谓战俘不愿回他们的祖国的说法了”。英国的“新政治家与民族”周刊说：鉴于战俘营中存在着国民党特务的事实，“因此，有严正的理由可以询问，若干万战俘拒绝遣返，是否真像乔埃中将的道义原则立场所表示的那样真纯。……假如曾经强迫过战俘拒绝遣返，只要战俘营仍然处于目前的控制情况下，战俘们将不会很容易地对只作临时性访问的任何公正的监督组承认自己的意见。”后来东场里的事实完全证明了这个论断的正确。
    由于害怕朝中战俘要求回家，也由于害怕全世界看穿美方所谓战俘“拒绝遣返”的鬼话，美国在朝鲜停战之前就先后扣留了六万五千名朝中战俘。
    当二万多名不直接遣返的战俘被移交给中立国遣返委员会之后，美国政府就竭力阻挠朝中方面的解释工作。它通过由特务严密控制的东场里战俘营，向全世界继续贩卖战俘“宁可自杀也不愿遣返”的谎话。但是全世界在东场里清楚地看到了受美方指挥的特务以何等残忍、野蛮的手段阻止战俘遣返，而战俘又如何宁愿冒着生命危险逃出来要求遣返。
    中立国遣返委员会成立以来屡次发表的声明和文件，肯定地指出美方利用预为布置的特务分子对战俘施用暴力和暴力威胁以阻挠遣返，证实美方一贯地使用各种办法来破坏解释工作和“职权范围”各项条款的实施。中立国遣返委员会在总结性的“临时报告”中说：“战俘当其在营场中时均未享有寻求遣返的自由，并处于武力或武力威胁之下”，甚至经过解释的战俘也不能免于来自特务组织的武力或武力威胁，“暴力行为曾施用于那些愿意行使遣返权利的人”。由于这些众所周知的事实是无可抵赖的，美国的“基督教科学箴言报”今年一月二日在评论中立国遣返委员会发表的报告时不得不说：“虽然这件事情使盟国的宣传受到挫折，但是，在这些指责中至少有某些真实性的可能性是难以否认的。即便瑞士、瑞典这两个少数国家的措辞谨慎的报告，也使这种指责增加了真实感。”
    东场里战俘营里的情况激起了全世界特别是亚洲爱好和平人民的义愤。全印和平理事会主席克其鲁去年十月十二日在新德里的记者招待会上说：
  “印度报纸记者最近揭发了一些事实，说明战俘被强迫在身上刺字，美军控制的战俘营中发生恐怖屠杀，希望遣返的朝中战俘受到残酷拷打。这些事实使我们全国深深震惊。”克其鲁说，美方在战俘营中的罪行比希特勒匪帮的罪行还要“更加恐怖、更加野蛮得不知多少倍。”印度“自由报”在去年十月十日的社论中指出：“为了破坏朝鲜停战，美方公开地阻挠一切解释工作的安排、战俘的遣返以及中立国遣返委员会工作的进展。中立国遣返委员会的五个国家都亲眼看到这一点，全世界也都开始了解这一点。”“巴基斯坦时报”在去年十一月七日发表的社论中斥责美方指挥特务以暴力控制战俘、破坏解释。社论说，美方一开始就阻挠解释工作的粗暴企图，使最谨慎的中立观察家都为之震惊。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”在去年十一月七日的评论中对于声名狼藉的东场里美方特务统治在亚洲各国舆论中引起的反响表示惋惜。评论说：“无疑地，亚洲的普遍印象已是这样”，这就是：战俘中间的“恐怖和酷刑”已使战俘“选择回家成为危险的事”。
    美国的“心理战”已经彻底失败了。他们发明出来的“自愿遣返”、战俘“宁愿自杀也不愿回家”等等鬼话，现在连提也不敢提了。全世界从东场里就可以清楚地想像出巨济岛、济州岛、釜山战俘营里的景象。美国侵略者的野蛮和残暴，远远超过了它的先辈德国法西斯，现在已经没有人怀疑这一点了。人类正义的裁判既然没有放过德国法西斯，当然也决不会放过比德国法西斯更狠毒的美国侵略者。
