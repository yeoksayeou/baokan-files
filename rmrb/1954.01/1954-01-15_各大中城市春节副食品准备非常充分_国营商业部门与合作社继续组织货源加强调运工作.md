Xinhua News Agency, 14th. State-owned commercial business organizations and consumer cooperatives in major and medium-sized cities across the country are fully prepared to supply non-staple foods for the Spring Festival. Various regions are continuing to organize supplies and strengthen transportation. China Native Produce Company and China Food Company are currently transferring 32,700 live pigs and carcass pigs, as well as 2 million jin of carcass pork and cured meat, from within the customs area to the Northeast. State-owned commercial business departments in the Northeast have purchased over 1 million jin of carcass pork and beef within the customs area. This is a strong support to meet the needs of people in various industrial and mining areas and cities in the Northeast for non-staple foods during the Spring Festival.

In the work of preparing to supply non-staple foods for the Spring Festival, state-owned commercial business departments and consumer cooperatives in major cities have appropriately increased the variety of non-staple foods and paid attention to organizing private businesses to participate in the supply of non-staple foods for the Spring Festival. The Shanghai Municipal Cooperative has fully prepared pork, eggs, and fruits, and is planning to organize private merchants to transport hairy chickens and vegetables. The more than 100,000 dan of fresh fish purchased by the cooperative in Zhejiang and other places are being transported to Shanghai in batches. A large batch of fresh fish purchased by the Beijing Native Produce Company from Hankou and Xuzhou will be shipped to Beijing within the next few days.

Since the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Doing a Good Job in the Supply of Non-staple Foods for the New Year and Spring Festival," relevant departments at the central level have held meetings on the supply of non-staple foods for the New Year and Spring Festival. They have focused on arranging the supply plans for pigs, eggs, and some aquatic products and vegetables, and have given strong support to some regions in organizing supplies and allocating transportation. Most major and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas have established New Year and Spring Festival Non-staple Food Supply Committees or New Year and Spring Festival Non-staple Food Supply Work Groups under the leadership of local financial committees, unified leadership forces, strengthened planning in their work, and ensured the supply of non-staple foods for the New Year. The supply of general non-staple foods in major cities during the New Year generally exceeded the supply volume of the same period in the previous year, and the broad masses of people have responded positively.

Because the people need many kinds and large quantities of non-staple foods during the Spring Festival, and the supply areas are wide, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives in various places are continuing to strengthen the supply of goods for the Spring Festival on the basis of the New Year material supply work, so as to ensure the material supply for the people to celebrate the Spring Festival happily.

    各大中城市春节副食品准备非常充分
    国营商业部门与合作社继续组织货源加强调运工作
    【新华社十四日讯】全国各大、中城市的国营商业业务机构和消费合作社对春节城市副食品的供应已有充分准备，各地正继续组织货源，加强调运。中国土产公司和中国食品公司现正从关内调运活猪和白条猪三万二千七百头以及白条猪肉和咸肉两百万斤到东北去，东北国营商业业务部门在关内采购的白条猪肉和牛肉达一百多万斤。这对满足东北各工矿区和城市人民春节需要副食品是有力的支持。
    在准备供应春节副食品的工作中，各大城市国营商业业务部门和消费合作社都适当增加了副食品的品种，并注意组织私营商业参加春节副食品的供应工作。上海市合作社已充分准备了猪肉、鸡蛋和水果等，并有计划地组织私商贩运毛鸡和蔬菜。该社在浙江等地采购的十多万担鲜鱼，正分批运往上海。北京市土产公司从汉口和徐州采购的大批鲜鱼，日内将启运来京。
    自中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会发出“关于做好新年，春节副食品供应工作的指示”以后，中央级各有关部门召开了新年、春节副食品供应会议，有重点地安排了猪、鸡蛋和部分水产、蔬菜等的供应计划，并在组织货源和调拨运输工作上给了某些地区以有力支持。各大、中城市及工矿区多在当地财委领导下，成立了年节副食品供应委员会或年节副食品供应工作组，统一了领导力量，加强了工作中的计划性，保证了新年副食品的供应，各主要城市新年一般副食品的供应量都超过前年同期的供应量，广大人民反映良好。
    由于春节人民需要副食品的种类多，数量大，供应地区较广，各地国营商业和合作社在新年物资供应工作基础上，正继续加强春节物资供应工作，以保证人民欢度春节的物资供应。
