Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 21st: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission today passed a resolution warning the U.S. side that "releasing" Korean and Chinese POWs is a violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's resolution was passed by a majority vote of the Polish, Czechoslovakian, and Indian members. The resolution fully proves that the U.S. action of "releasing POWs at midnight on January 22nd to make them civilians" is illegal and a serious violation of the Armistice Agreement. The Swedish and Swiss members voted against the resolution because it exposed the U.S.'s illegal actions of handing over Korean and Chinese POWs to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek.

According to the official communique of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the full text of the resolution proposed by the Polish and Czechoslovakian members and passed by a majority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is as follows:

    Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission
    A. In view of:
    (a) Most of the prisoners of war in its custody have not had the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation, and have failed to utilize the procedures stipulated in the "Terms of Reference" and the rules formulated in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" regarding the exercise of their right to repatriation,
    (b) The explanatory procedure, which all prisoners of war are entitled to under the "Terms of Reference" and which the Committee is responsible for implementing, has only been conducted for a small portion of all prisoners of war in the Committee's custody,
    (c) According to the "Terms of Reference", the issue of the treatment of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation should be submitted by the Committee to the political conference convened in accordance with Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement. Submitting this issue to the political conference is a mandatory provision and cannot be replaced by any other procedure,
    B. Noting that the Chairman and Executive Agent of the Committee have, on January 20, 1954, returned the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war under the Committee's custody, originally received from the United Nations Command, to the United Nations Command, and has requested the Command of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to likewise receive the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war under the Committee's custody, originally held by the Command of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army,
    It is hereby resolved:
    (1) To declare that any change in the status of the prisoners of war who have been returned or are prepared to be returned, whether by declaring them civilians or in any other way, before the implementation of the explanatory procedure and the discussion by the political conference, is a violation of the "Terms of Reference" and the Armistice Agreement.
    (2) To notify the United Nations Command and the Command of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army of this resolution.

    中立国遣返委员会通过决议
    声明“释放”战俘是违反停战协定的
    这个决议对美方提出了严重的警告
    【新华社开城二十一日电】中立国遣返委员会今天通过的一项决议警告美方：“释放”朝中战俘是违反朝鲜停战协定的。中立国遣返委员会的这项决议是以波兰、捷克斯洛伐克及印度委员的多数票通过的，这项决议充分证明美方要在一月二十二日午夜“释放战俘使之成为平民身份”的行动是非法的，并且是严重违反停战协定的。瑞典和瑞士委员投票反对这项决议，因为这项决议揭露了美方把朝中战俘交给李承晚和蒋介石的非法行动。
    根据中立国遣返委员会的官方公报，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员所提出而为中立国遣返委员会多数通过的决议案全文如下：
    中立国遣返委员会
    甲、鉴于：
    （子）它所看管的大部分战俘都没有机会行使他们的被遣返权利，未能利用“职权范围”和根据“职权范围”拟订的规则中所规定的关于行使他们的被遣返权利的程序，
    （丑）根据“职权范围”一切战俘都有权享受的、并责成委员会执行的解释程序，只对委员会看管下的全部战俘中的一小部分进行过，
    （寅）根据“职权范围”，未行使被遣返权利的战俘的处理问题应由委员会提交根据停战协定第六十款召开的政治会议，把这个问题提交政治会议是强制性的规定，不能以任何其他程序来代替，
    乙、注意到委员会的主席和执行人已在一九五四年一月二十日把委员会看管下的、原来从联合国军司令部看管下接收过来的不直接遣返战俘交还给联合国军司令部看管，他并已要求朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部同样接收委员会看管下的、原来由朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部看管的不直接遣返战俘，
    兹决议：
    （一）声明在实施解释程序和经过政治会议讨论之前，用宣布成为平民身份或用任何其他方式，来对已经交还的或准备交还的战俘的身份作任何改变，都是违反“职权范围”和停战协定的。
    （二）把这项决议通知联合国军司令部和朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军司令部。
