Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 28th: On January 28th, representatives of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross Society accepted 347 prisoners of war who were formerly under the guard of the Indian forces at the Songgok-ri POW camp and then issued a statement to reporters. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Korean-Chinese Red Cross Society cannot stand idly by while the prisoners of war at the Songgok-ri POW camp are left unattended. The prisoners of war at the Songgok-ri POW camp have openly stated that they fully support the Korean-Chinese side's disagreement with the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission Chairman's suggestion that they be accepted and continue to be guarded by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. They pointed out that they had continuously requested the United Nations forces to continue explanations, but the United Nations forces abandoned the explanations, and the Indian forces withdrew their guard over them, leaving them unattended. The responsibility for the emergence of the aforementioned state of affairs does not lie with them at all. They are genuinely refusing repatriation and resolutely demanding to come to the Korean-Chinese side, therefore, they request the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to agree to and assist them in obtaining the right to reside on the Korean-Chinese side. The Korean-Chinese Red Cross Society sympathetically considered the claims and requests of the prisoners of war at the Songgok-ri POW camp and suggested that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers agree to our accepting this group of prisoners of war and be responsible for obtaining the right for them to reside in The Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers agreed to the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross Society and obtained the endorsement of the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, therefore, on January 28, 1954, the Korean-Chinese Red Cross Society accepted the 347 prisoners of war who were formerly under the guard of the Indian forces at the Songgok-ri POW camp, along with their relevant documents. The Korean-Chinese Red Cross Society will be responsible for obtaining the right for them to reside on the Korean-Chinese side. When the Korean political conference or other relevant international conferences discuss the issue of prisoners of war in the future, the Korean-Chinese Red Cross Society will be responsible for accounting for this group of prisoners of war who were formerly under the guard of the Indian forces at the Songgok-ri POW camp.

　　朝中红十字会接受松谷里战俘营战俘
　　朝中红十字会将在有关国际会议上对他们作出交代
    【新华社开城二十八日电】一月二十八日，朝中红十字会代表接受了原在松谷里战俘营印度部队看管下的三百四十七名战俘后，向记者发表了谈话。谈话全文如下：
    朝中红十字会不能坐视松谷里战俘营战俘处于无人过问的状态。松谷里战俘营战俘已公开表示他们完全支持朝中方面不同意中立国遣返委员会主席所建议的由朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军接受，并继续看管他们的主张。他们指出他们曾不断要求联合国军继续进行解释，但联合国军放弃了解释，而印度部队又撤退了对他们的看管，使他们处于无人过问的状态。上述状态之所以产生，其责任完全不在他们。他们是真正拒绝遣返、坚决要求到朝中方面来的，因此他们要求中立国遣返委员会同意并协助他们取得在朝中方面居住的权利。朝中红十字会同情地考虑了松谷里战俘营战俘的主张和要求，建议朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军同意由我们接受这批战俘，并负责为他们取得在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国居住的权利。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军同意了朝中红十字会的建议，并取得了中立国遣返委员会主席的赞同，因此朝中红十字会在一九五四年一月二十八日接受了原在松谷里战俘营印度部队看管下的三百四十七名战俘及其有关证件。朝中红十字会将负责为他们取得在朝中方面居住的权利。当将来朝鲜政治会议或其他有关国际会议讨论战俘问题时，朝中红十字会将负责对这批原在松谷里战俘营印度部队看管下的战俘作出交代。
