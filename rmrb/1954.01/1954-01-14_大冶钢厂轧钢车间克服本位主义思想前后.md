    The production enthusiasm of the workers in the steel rolling workshop of the Daye Steel Plant of the Central China Iron and Steel Company has always been very high; as long as production can be improved, even if it is a little more tiring, everyone works very hard. However, due to the lack of overall education in the past, the workers developed serious departmentalism. In their work, everyone wanted to overwhelm other shifts to make themselves "glorious." Therefore, they did not spread good experiences, and even secretly sabotaged, causing difficulties for other shifts. Some heating furnace workers, near the end of their shift, would load short-sized or cracked steel ingots and billets into the furnace, which affected the output or quality of the next shift. None of the three shifts were willing to spend a few minutes removing the slag in the furnace. In the end, the slag formed a large scab, blocking the furnace opening, and it would take at least half an hour to clear it—such a thing, if it happened to that shift, that shift would be considered "unlucky." The workshop stipulated a shift handover system, and it was implemented well for the first few days, but later no one took it seriously.
    When the round-the-clock operation plan was implemented last September, and the workshop leaders proposed a red flag emulation campaign, this phenomenon became even more serious. One day, with only one minute left before the shift handover time, the first shift kept taking the well-heated steel billets out of the furnace and sending them to the rolling mill via the roller table. A worker from the second shift then turned off the power to the roller table, and the two shifts started arguing. The second shift said to the first shift: "You are not observing the time. There is only one minute left. How can you finish rolling so much steel?" The first shift said to the second shift: "We have created a new record. You are not convinced and want to give the red flag to you."
    Similar problems occurred one after another, and the workshop leaders took them seriously. After research, the Party branch put forward the slogan "Oppose departmentalism and establish collectivist thinking." Administratively, they started to rectify the shift handover system, and the trade union committee also mobilized the masses to check departmentalism.
    At the beginning, everyone only exposed the problems of other shifts and did not talk about the departmentalism of their own shifts. Qiu Fangren, a member of the Party branch and the workshop director, participated in the discussions of the relatively advanced eighth shift group, and repeatedly explained to them that an advanced shift should not only be advanced in production, but also in thinking, in implementing the system, and in all aspects. Checking departmentalism should first check one's own shift in order to solve the problem ideologically. After several discussions, Ding Wanzhen (a Party member), the leader of the trade union group, first examined his own shortcomings: their division of labor and responsibilities was good, ensuring that there were no wrong furnace numbers, but other shifts often made mistakes, but they were unwilling to tell other shifts. Some workers inadvertently revealed a few words, and he blamed others for "talking nonsense."
    After the Party members and key members took the lead in examining themselves, everyone's concerns were dispelled, and many facts were exposed. The workshop leaders then focused on the eighth shift and began to conduct "detailed accounting" education.
    The eighth shift did not promote its experience in avoiding wrong furnace numbers, allowing the remaining two shifts to scrap 5.36 tons of high-quality steel, which, calculated at the lowest price of 10 million yuan per ton, resulted in a national loss of 53.6 million yuan. There were also two occasions when the splint was not replaced when it should have been, and the next shift was not informed during the handover, resulting in the next shift producing eight tons less of high-quality steel, which, calculated on the basis of profit alone, caused a national loss of 32 million yuan. In addition, there were three occasions when the rolling rolls were not replaced in time, affecting the next shift's production of three tons less of finished products, resulting in a loss of 12 million yuan in profits. In addition, the other three shifts reduced the loading of steel billets near the end of the shift, resulting in a reduction of 1.8 tons of finished products per day in the entire work section, which, calculated over 50 days, resulted in a reduction of 90 tons of finished products, resulting in a loss of 360 million yuan in profits. These four items alone caused a national loss of 457.6 million yuan. They also calculated that this money could buy 450,000 jin of rice, enough for 7,000 people to eat for a month. Everyone was shocked by this huge loss and unanimously felt that their departmentalism had caused such a great loss to the country, and they dared not fool around anymore.
    The eighth shift's experience in "detailed accounting" was quickly promoted to other shifts. Yuan Zhaocai, the leader of the seventh shift, also felt during this education that it was wrong not to make a clear handover during the shift handover. He took the lead in examining himself in the group and calculated the details. Jiang Liandi, the leader of the first shift, was originally called the "King of Departmentalism." One day, their shift created a new record of exceeding the production plan by 14 percent, but the production situation of the other two shifts in the same work section was not good at the time. As a result, on this day, their work section only completed an average of 103 percent of the plan. Through this education, Jiang Liandi figured it out. He told the workers in the shift: "It is not enough for one shift to be good. The three shifts must be for the entire work section, and the work sections must be for the entire workshop. It is necessary for the entire workshop and the entire factory to be good."
    Last October, when the workshop launched a labor emulation drive to increase production and practice economy, the leaders accepted the past lessons and first conducted political education on socialist emulation among the masses. At the same time, they set a target of increasing production and practicing economy by 10 billion yuan in the entire workshop within three months, calling on everyone to work together to overfulfill this plan. In terms of methods, they also changed to work sections competing with work sections that were not closely related to each other. The condition was to overfulfill the operation plan. A shift that completed the operation plan would hang a victory sign, and a work section that completed it would get a red flag. Administratively, a shift supervisor and a shift work section chief were also established to supervise the shift handover. The workers who had received overall ideological education stipulated in the group pact and personal guarantee conditions: "Ensure detailed handover and detailed acceptance, and maintain unity with all shifts," and "Be sure to promote good experiences to all shifts." Everyone not only strictly implemented the shift handover system, but also cared about the production of other shifts everywhere.
    The original "King of Departmentalism" Jiang Liandi repeatedly told the workers in his shift at this time: "We must strive to be a model shift for overcoming departmentalism." One day, a bearing broke down at the end of the shift. He immediately summoned technicians above the fifth grade in his shift to help the second shift repair it, and did not leave work until it was repaired. The third shift found that there was a small problem with a bearing (which would affect product quality if not noticed). At the end of the shift, they told the first shift. The first shift immediately made adjustments and created a new production record on the same day. Jiang Liandi said very moved at this time: "Thanks to the third shift for shining a light on the road for us, otherwise we would have bumped our heads and produced a lot of defective products."
    Zhou Caihao, a heating furnace worker in the eighth shift, changed the original one layer of steel billets to two layers when burning large steel billets, which made the steel billets heat up faster and increased output by 10 percent. Zhou Huatang of the ninth shift initially thought that "this experience is nothing" and did not pay attention to it. After being criticized by the masses, he further changed the two layers to two and a half layers while seriously implementing Zhou Caihao's experience. Because the gap in the middle layer was large, the flame was easy to rise, and the upper layer of steel billets heated up faster, which increased the output by another 30 percent. Zhou Caihao then closely followed up and applied the suggestions made by Soviet experts to other work sections to his own work section based on Zhou Huatang's suggestions, so that the lower layer of steel billets also heated up quickly, and the output increased by another 20 percent. Through such mutual exchange and further study of advanced experience, the production of large steel in the entire work section increased by 60 percent.
    In early November, in the second week of the full-scale launch of the labor emulation drive in the steel rolling workshop, several work sections comprehensively completed the round-the-clock operation plan and exceeded various indicators.

    大冶钢厂轧钢车间克服本位主义思想前后
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂轧钢车间工人的生产情绪一直是很高的；只要能提高生产，那怕再累些，大家都干得挺带劲。但是由于过去缺乏整体教育，工人产生了严重的本位主义思想。在工作中，谁都想压倒别的班，使自己“光荣”，因此有了好的经验不传播，甚至暗中捣鬼，给别的班造成困难。个别加热炉的工人在快下班的时候，曾经将短尺寸的或有裂纹的钢锭、钢胚装进炉内，因而影响了下一班的产量或质量。三个班都不肯花几分钟清除炉内的渣滓，到最后渣滓结成一块大疤，将炉口堵住了，至少得花半点钟才能清出——这样的事情临到那个班，那个班便算“倒霉”。车间规定了交接班制度，开始几天也执行得不错，但是后来谁也不认真执行了。
    去年九月实行昼夜作业计划，车间的领导提出夺红旗竞赛后，这种现象更严重了。有一天，离交接班时间还差一分钟，第一班还不断地从炉内捞出烧好了的钢胚由滚道往轧钢机送，第二班有个工人便将滚道的电门关了，两个班就争吵起来。第二班说第一班：“不遵守时间，只差一分钟了，你们捞出这许多钢，怎么轧得完？”第一班说第二班：“我们创造了新纪录你们不服气，把红旗送给你们好了。”
    类似这样的问题，接连不断的发生，车间领导重视起来了。经过研究以后，支部提出了“反对本位主义，树立集体思想”的口号，行政上着手整顿交接班制度，工会委员会也发动群众检查本位主义。
    开始时，大家都只揭发别班的，不谈自己班里的本位主义。支部委员、车间主任邱方任参加了比较先进的第八班小组的讨论，给他们反复讲解先进班不仅要在生产上先进，还应该在思想上、在执行制度上，在各方面都先进。检查本位主义应该首先检查本班，才能在思想上解决问题。经过几次酝酿，工会小组长丁万珍（党员）首先检讨了自己的缺点：他们分工专责搞的好，保证了不错炉号，别的班却时常弄错，但是他们却不肯向别班讲，有的工人无意间泄露了几句，他还责怪人家不该“乱说”。
    经过党员、骨干分子的带头检讨，打破了大家的顾虑，揭发了许多事实。车间领导方面便以第八班为重点，开始进行“算细账”的教育。
    第八班有了避免错炉号的经验不推广，让其余两班先后废了五吨三百六十公斤优质钢材，以最低的价格每吨一千万元计算，国家就损失了五千三百六十万元。还有两次该换夹板不换，交接班时也不告诉下一班，使下一班少生产八吨优质钢材，单是以利润计算，使国家损失了三千二百万元。另外还有三次没抓紧时间换轧辊，影响下班少产三吨成品，损失利润一千二百万元。此外，其他的三个班也都在快下班时少装钢胚，使全工段每天少产一吨八的成品，以五十天计算，少生产九十吨成品，损失利润三亿六千万元。只这四项，便使国家损失四亿五千七百六十万元。他们又算出这些钱可以买四十五万斤大米，足够七千人吃一个月。对这个巨大的损失，大家都大吃一惊，一致感到自己的本位主义给国家造成这么大的损失，以后可不敢再胡闹了。
    第八班“算细账”的经验很快推广到其他各班。第七班组长苑兆才，在这次教育中，也感到交班时，交不清是不对头的，他在组内带头检讨，并算了细账。第一班的组长姜连弟原来被人叫做“本位大王”。他们班上有一天创造了超过生产计划百分之十四的新纪录，但在同一工段的其他两班，当时生产情况却不够好。结果，这天他们这一工段平均只完成计划百分之一百零三。通过这次教育，姜连弟想通了，他告诉班内的工人：“光一班好不行。必须三个班为了全工段，各工段为了全车间，得全车间好、全工厂好才行。”
    去年十月，车间展开增产节约劳动竞赛，领导上接受过去的教训，首先在群众中进行社会主义竞赛的政治教育，同时提出全车间在三个月内增产节约一百亿元的目标，号召大家共同为超额完成这个计划而奋斗。在方法上也改为彼此之间联系不大的工段与工段竞赛，条件是超额完成作业计划。班完成了作业计划挂优胜牌，工段完成了得红旗。行政上也建立了值班主任、值班工段长监督交接班的制度。受过整体思想教育的工人，都在小组公约和个人保证条件中订上：“保证详细交班，详细接班，与各班搞好团结”，“有了好经验一定向各班推广”。大家不仅严格执行交接班制度，而且处处关心别班的生产。
    原来的“本位大王”姜连弟这时也一再向本班的工人讲：“我们要争取作克服本位主义的模范班。”有一天下班时，有一个轴承坏了，他立即召集本班五级以上的技工来帮助第二班修理，直到修好以后才下班。第三班发现有一个轴承有一点小毛病（如果不注意便会影响产品质量），下班时便转告第一班；第一班立即进行了调整，在当天创造了生产新纪录。姜连弟这时很感动地说：“多亏第三班给我们打灯照路，要不然我们会碰得头青脸肿，不知出多少废品”。
    第八班加热炉工人周才浩在烧大钢胚时，将原来的一层钢胚改装两层，使钢胚受热快，产量提高百分之十。第九班周华堂开始认为“这个经验不算啥”，不加重视；受到群众的批评后，他在认真执行周才浩的经验中，又进一步将两层改两层半，由于中层空隙大，火焰容易上升，上层钢胚受热更快，又使产量提高百分之三十。周才浩紧跟着又在周华堂建议的基础上，将苏联专家向别的工段提的建议应用到本工段来，使下层钢胚受热也快，产量又提高了百分之二十。经过这样互相交流与进一步钻研先进经验，全工段大钢材的生产便提高了百分之六十。
    十一月初，轧钢车间劳动竞赛全面展开的第二周，几个工段都全面地完成了昼夜作业计划，而且超过了各项指标。
