Xinhua News Agency, January 14th, Berlin dispatch: Following the failure of the June 17, 1953, Berlin provocation instigated by U.S. imperialism, the security organs of the German Democratic Republic have successively uncovered many U.S. and West German espionage and spy organizations hidden throughout East Germany, safeguarding the democratic government and the safety of the people.

In early October of last year, the Magdeburg District Court concluded the trial of seven special agents and saboteurs from the West Berlin fascist terrorist organization "Fighting Group Against Inhumanity." The ringleader of these bandits, Hessler, was sentenced to death. Hessler had organized two incidents of blowing up railways of the Republic; before his arrest, he was preparing to blow up a workshop of the Ernst Thälmann Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Magdeburg.

Prior to this case, the National Security Organs and the Supreme Court of the German Democratic Republic sentenced eight spies and saboteurs who, under the orders of U.S. and German imperialists, were active in the coal mining industry of the German Democratic Republic.

Among the espionage organizations uncovered by the National Security Organs was a West German intelligence organization called "German Information Office," directly controlled by U.S. intelligence agencies. This organization was a branch of the espionage and sabotage organization led by former Hitler's important intelligence officer, Nazi General Gehlen. The branches of this organization masqueraded as commercial firms and engaged in economic, political, and military espionage and sabotage activities in the German Democratic Republic and the democratic sector of Berlin. They also tried to secretly transport special agents to People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union. The main members of this organization were all former Hitler Stormtroopers, SS personnel, secret police, and former Nazi officers. All of their operating expenses were provided by U.S. intelligence agencies, and they maintained close ties with the Bonn government's "Ministry for All-German Affairs" and the "Blank Office" (West Germany's military department). Thanks to the high vigilance of the people and public security departments of the German Democratic Republic, branches of this organization in Berlin, Halle, Cottbus, Potsdam, and other places were uncovered. The head of this organization, Hesse, and six others were sentenced to prison terms ranging from twelve years to life imprisonment. The deputy director of the organization's intelligence station in West Berlin – "Department X-9592," Hans-Joachim Geyer, surrendered to the government of the German Democratic Republic.

The National Security Organs of the German Democratic Republic also eliminated another stronghold of the West German intelligence agency called "Industrial Hygiene Institute of the Free University" in the German Democratic Republic. This "Institute" was the West Berlin branch of an espionage organization under the "Blank Office," and was also directed and funded by U.S. spy agencies, led by former Hitler Army General Drölin. The main personnel in this spy organization were former fascist officers. This espionage organization established locally distributed strongholds in the German Democratic Republic, each consisting of three people in a group, using radio transceivers to maintain contact with U.S. spy agencies, and collecting intelligence for the U.S. authorities.

Recently, the Cottbus District Court also tried another six spies from the espionage agency called the "Higher Political School," led by the "Blank Office." This organization engaged in subversive activities in the German Democratic Republic and carried out activities against the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries. The defendants, Eike and others, were sentenced to prison terms ranging from nine to fifteen years respectively.

    民主德国保安机关保持高度警惕性
    接连破获许多美国和西德的特务破坏组织
    【新华社十四日讯】柏林消息：在美帝国主义制造的一九五三年六月十七日柏林挑衅事件失败以后，德意志民主共和国公安机关接连地破获了许多暗藏在民主德国各地的美国和西德的特务和间谍组织，保卫了民主政权和人民的安全。
    去年十月初，马格德堡地方法院结束了审讯西柏林法西斯恐怖组织“反对非人道主义斗争团”的七名特务和破坏分子的工作，这些匪徒的魁首赫斯勒被判处死刑。赫斯勒曾组织过两次炸毁共和国铁路的事件；在被捕之前，他正在准备炸毁马格德堡的恩斯特·台尔曼重型机器制造工厂的一个车间。
    在这案件之前，德意志民主共和国国家保安机关和最高法院判处了八个奉美、德帝国主义者的命令，在德意志民主共和国煤矿工业中活动的间谍与破坏分子。
    在国家保安机关破获的特务组织中，有一个由美国特务机关直接控制的、名为“德国情报处”的西德谍报组织。这个组织是前希特勒重要谍报人员、纳粹将领盖伦领导的间谍破坏组织的一个分支。这个组织的支部伪装成商号，在德意志民主共和国和柏林民主区进行经济的、政治的和军事的间谍工作和破坏活动。他们并设法秘密地把特务分子运送到人民民主国家和苏联去。这个组织的主要成员都是以前的希特勒冲锋队队员、党卫军人员、秘密警察以及前纳粹军官。他们的一切活动经费都由美国特务机关供给，他们并与波恩政府的“全德事务部”和“布兰克部”（西德的军部）保持着密切的联系。由于德意志民主共和国人民和公安部门保持高度的警惕性，这个组织在柏林、哈雷、科特布斯、波茨坦和其他地方的分支被破获了。这个组织的首脑赫塞等七人被分别判处十二年至终身的劳役。这个组织在西柏林的谍报站——“X—九五九二分部”的副主任汉斯·约阿希姆·盖耶向德意志民主共和国政府投诚了。
    德意志民主共和国国家保安机关并且拔除了另一个名为“自由大学工业卫生研究所”的西德特务机关在德意志民主共和国的据点。这个“研究所”是“布兰克部”下面的一个特务组织的西柏林分部，也受美国间谍机关的指挥与资助，由前希特勒陆军将领德林领导，其中的主要人员都是一些前法西斯军官。这个间谍组织在德意志民主共和国建立了分布在各地的据点，每三人编成一个小组，用无线电收发报机与美国间谍机关保持联系，为美国当局收集情报。
    最近，科特布斯地方法院又审判了另一个由
  “布兰克部”领导的、名为“高等政治学校”的间谍机构的六名间谍，这个组织在德意志民主共和国从事颠覆活动并进行反对苏联和人民民主国家的活动。被告艾克等六人被分别判处九年至十五年的徒刑。
