Xinhua News Agency: The first automated thermal power plant in Xinjiang Province—the state-owned Dihua Power Plant—officially generated electricity on December 30th of last year after a 72-hour joint trial run. On that day, Dihua held a grand celebration ceremony. At the meeting, Gao Jinchun, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, presented a flag to the Soviet experts participating in the construction of the Dihua Power Plant on behalf of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government. Young Pioneers of various ethnic groups presented flowers to the Soviet experts and labor models to pay their respects. Wang Enmao, Secretary of the Xinjiang Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the celebration ceremony, pointing out that the construction of this automated thermal power plant in Xinjiang Province, where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, has significant economic and political significance. He said that this fact shows that under the leadership of the Central People's Government and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, the industrial construction of the people in the frontier of the motherland will surely overcome all kinds of difficulties and achieve success.

The state-owned Dihua Power Plant began construction in May 1952 and was installed and partially test-run by the end of October 1953. The power generation capacity of this power plant is 1.4 times the total original power generation capacity of the entire Xinjiang Province. Its electricity will fully meet the needs of various industries in Dihua City that are developing, such as textile, flour, machinery, and coal mining. Within three months of its power generation, the cotton textile industrial production in Dihua City will expand by 66 percent, the flour output will increase threefold, and emerging industries such as printing and dyeing, and cement will also develop successively. The electricity consumption of people of all ethnic groups in Dihua City will also be adequately supplied.

The state-owned Dihua Power Plant is fully equipped with Soviet automation equipment. From surveying and designing to installation and operation, it has received technical guidance and assistance from more than 20 Soviet experts. With the help of Soviet experts, a group of new civil construction, machine installation, and production workers and technicians has grown up in the frontier of the motherland, and 86 labor models have emerged.

The construction of the state-owned Dihua Power Plant also received strong support from technical personnel and workers from North China and Northeast China, as well as transport troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang.

    新建迪化自动化火力发电厂正式发电
    据新华社讯：新疆省第一座自动化火力发电厂——国营迪化电厂经过七十二小时的联合试车后，已在去年十二月三十日正式发电。当天，迪化举行了隆重的庆祝典礼。会上，新疆省人民政府副主席高锦纯代表新疆省人民政府向参加迪化电厂建设的苏联专家赠旗，各民族的少年先锋队队员向苏联专家和劳动模范献花致敬。中共中央新疆分局书记王恩茂在庆祝典礼上讲话，指出在少数民族聚居的新疆省，建设这座自动化火力发电厂是有重大的经济意义和政治意义的。他说，这一事实说明在中央人民政府的领导下，在苏联的援助下，祖国边疆人民的工业建设事业定会战胜种种困难，获得成功。
    国营迪化电厂从一九五二年五月开始建设，一九五三年十月底安装完毕，并局部试车。这个电厂的发电能力等于新疆全省原有发电能力总和的一点四倍。它的电力将充分供应迪化市正在发展的纺织、面粉、机械、采煤等各种工业的需要。在它发电后的三个月内，迪化市的棉纺织工业生产将要扩大百分之六十六，面粉产量将要增加三倍，新兴的印染、水泥等工业也将陆续发展起来，迪化市各族人民的生活用电也会得到充足供应。
    国营迪化电厂全部是苏联的自动化设备。从勘察设计到安装运转，先后得到了二十多位苏联专家的技术指导和帮助。在苏联专家帮助下，一批新的土木建筑、机器安装和掌握生产的工人和技术人员已在祖国边疆成长起来，并涌现出了八十六名劳动模范。
    国营迪化电厂的建设，并得到来自华北、东北的技术人员和工人以及驻新疆的人民解放军运输部队的有力支援。
