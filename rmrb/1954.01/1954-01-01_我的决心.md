    My Determination
    Wang Chonglun, Industrial Model Worker of Special Merit, Anshan City
    The year 1954 has arrived. In this new year, I constantly think about how our working class should strive for greater victories on the production front and for the early arrival of socialism. I love my motherland, I love labor, and I want to further develop my enthusiasm and creativity in the new production tasks and strive for even greater victories.
    In 1953, thanks to the cultivation and education of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League in our workshop, as well as the earnest guidance and help of the workshop technicians and veteran workers, I created the universal tool holder. This creation increased production efficiency by six to seven times and promoted the "finding tricks and tapping potential" movement throughout the workshop, which brought a new look to production. In the past, our work section often affected other work sections due to a lack of slotting machines. Since I created the universal tool holder, jobs that couldn't be completed on the slotting machines could be done on the planing machines. As a result, the production efficiency of the entire workshop was promoted and improved. For example, the equipment operation rate in the past was only 65.31 percent, but now it has reached 92.31 percent; the equilibrium rate was previously only 64.6 percent, but now it is 76.3 percent; the production cycle used to be 46 days, but now it only takes 14 days. At the beginning of 1953, we could only complete 96.33 percent of the task, but after creating the universal tool holder, we completed 346.62 percent of the original plan every month. I was also awarded the glorious title of Special-Class Labor Model.
    In 1954, I must use new actions to strive for greater victories on the production front. Our country's large-scale construction has just begun, and I know how much hope our people place in us. I am also not satisfied with past successes, and I am determined to dedicate all my strength to the peaceful construction of the motherland and its people. In the future, I will definitely unite with all young workers, technical personnel, and veteran workers to diligently study the advanced Soviet scientific and technological theories and construction experiences in order to improve our technical level.
    Currently, I am working with young workers Wang Wenshou, Cui Junshan, and other comrades to study the improvement of grinding machine tools. I am confident that we will successfully complete the transformation by mid-January to ensure the improvement of grinding machine production efficiency and product quality. In addition, I want to use every second to study technology, improve tools, not let go of small experiences and tricks in my work, absorb other people's advanced experiences, and enrich myself. I want to work with all the workers to use practical actions to over fulfill the 1954 production tasks assigned to us by the state.

    我的决心
    鞍山市工业特等劳动模范　王崇伦
    一九五四年到来了。在这新年的时候，我时刻想到我们工人阶级应该怎样在生产战线上争取更大的胜利，争取社会主义的早日到来。我热爱祖国，热爱劳动，我要在新的生产任务中，进一步发挥我的积极性和创造性，争取更大的胜利。
    在一九五三年，由于我们车间党、政、工、团的培养和教育，以及车间技术员和老工人的殷勤指导和帮助，使我创造了万能工具胎。这一创造，使生产效率提高了六—七倍，并推动了全车间的找窍门、挖潜力的运动，生产上也就出现了新面貌。过去，我们这个工段，因插床不够，常常影响其他工段。自从我创造了万能工具胎以后，插床上做不完的活，就可以在刨床上做。这样一来，就推动和提高了全车间的生产效率。比方说：过去的设备作业率只有百分之六五点三一，现在到了百分之九二点三一；均衡率以前只有百分之六四点六，现在是百分之七六点三；生产周期过去是四十六天，现在只要十四天。一九五三年初，只能完成任务的百分之九六点三三，创造了万能工具胎以后，每月完成原计划的百分之三四六点六二。我也获得了特等劳动模范的光荣称号。
    在一九五四年中，我一定要用新的行动，争取生产战线上的更大的胜利。我们祖国的大规模建设刚刚开始，我知道我们的人民对于我们抱着多么大的希望。我也不满足以往的成功，我要坚决把一切力量贡献给祖国人民的和平建设事业。今后我一定和全体青年工人一道，团结技术人员和老工人，努力学习苏联先进的科学技术理论和建设经验，以提高技术水平。
    现在，我正跟青年工人王文寿和崔俊山等同志研究改进磨床工具。我有信心在一月中旬改造成功，以保证提高磨床的生产效率和产品质量。此外，我要利用一分一秒的时间，来研究技术，改进工具，不放过工作中的细小经验和窍门，吸取别人的先进经验，充实自己。我要跟全体工人一道，用实际行动来超额完成国家所交给我们的一九五四年的生产任务。
