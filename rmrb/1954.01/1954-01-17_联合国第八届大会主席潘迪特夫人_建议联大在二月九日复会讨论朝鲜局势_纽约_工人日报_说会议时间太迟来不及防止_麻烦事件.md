Xinhua News Agency, Sixteenth Dispatch: New York News: Mrs. Pandit, President of the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, currently in Delhi, sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 10th, stating that at the request of the Indian government, she suggested that the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly reconvene on February 9 to discuss the Korean situation. Mrs. Pandit also requested that all UN member states respond by January 22.

Hammarskjöld forwarded Mrs. Pandit's notification to all UN member states on the 11th.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, Sixteenth Dispatch: New York's "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 12th, saying: "The Korean situation is deteriorating, and the meeting on February 9 (the date Mrs. Pandit suggested the UN General Assembly reconvene) may be too late to prevent 'trouble.' Syngman Rhee's spokesman has threatened that if the 22,000 non-directly repatriated prisoners of war are not handed over to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek by January 23, such an incident will occur."

"Daily Worker" pointed out: Generals Hull and Taylor have stated that they would use force to regain custody of the prisoners of war. General Hull has also visited Taiwan to arrange for the transfer of 14,000 Chinese prisoners of war to Taiwan.

"Daily Worker," after pointing out that the United Nations has an obligation to discuss the Korean situation, said: "Of course, the American delegation opposes the United Nations meeting to discuss the Korean issue because the Eisenhower government wants to maintain a very tense situation, hoping to keep the door open for new hostilities so that it can use this action as a contingency when the deepening economic recession becomes uncontrollable."

"Daily Worker" concluded: "However, the powerful peace forces in our country previously forced Eisenhower and Dulles to agree to an armistice. This force is now equally capable of forcing the government to negotiate in good faith, so that the details of turning the armistice into peace can be completed, and the Korean dispute can be ended. We believe that this is the outcome that most Americans desire."
  
Xinhua News Agency, Sixteenth Dispatch: TASS, Delhi, Fifteenth Dispatch: The "Indian Times" commented on the Korean situation, saying that India "advocates extending the explanation period for prisoners of war so that those who have not expressed their opinions on repatriation can do so." The "Indian Express" believes that "negotiations on the Korean political conference have reached a stalemate, and the Korean issue has not been resolved for a long time. Therefore, it is necessary to resume the United Nations General Assembly meeting," as suggested by India.

    联合国第八届大会主席潘迪特夫人
    建议联大在二月九日复会讨论朝鲜局势
    纽约“工人日报”说会议时间太迟来不及防止“麻烦事件”
    【新华社十六日讯】纽约消息：目前正在德里的联合国第八届大会主席潘迪特夫人十日打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，表示她应印度政府的要求，建议联合国第八届大会在二月九日复会，以讨论朝鲜局势。潘迪特夫人并要求联合国各会员国在一月二十二日前答复。
    哈马舍尔德已在十一日将潘迪特夫人的通知，转交联合国各会员国。
    【新华社柏林十六日电】纽约“工人日报”十二日发表社论说：“朝鲜局势日益恶化，二月九日的会议（潘迪特夫人建议联合国大会在那一天复会）或许会嫌太迟，来不及防止‘麻烦事件’，李承晚的发言人曾扬言，如果二万二千名不直接遣返的战俘在一月二十三日不交给李承晚和蒋介石，就会发生这样的事件。”
    “工人日报”指出：赫尔将军和泰勒将军曾经表示要使用武力重新取得对战俘的看管权，赫尔将军并曾访问台湾，去安排运送一万四千名中国战俘去台湾的事宜。
    “工人日报”在指出联合国有义务讨论朝鲜局势后说：“当然，美国代表团是反对联合国会议讨论朝鲜问题的，因为艾森豪威尔政府希望保持非常紧张的局势，希望为新的敌对行动开着大门，以便在日益加深的经济衰退变得无法控制时，把这种行动当作应急手段。”
    “工人日报”最后说：“但是，我们国内强大的和平力量先前曾迫使艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯同意停战，这支力量现在同样能够迫使政府怀着诚意去进行谈判，这样就可以完成把停战变成和平的细节工作，就能够结束朝鲜争端，我们相信，这种结局是大多数美国人民所希望的。”
      【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社德里十五日讯：“印度时报”评论朝鲜局势说：印度“主张延长对战俘的解释期限，以使未能就遣返表示意见的战俘可以表示意见”。“印度快报”认为：“关于朝鲜政治会议的谈判陷于僵局以及朝鲜问题迟迟得不到解决，因此有必要恢复联合国大会会议”，如印度所建议的那样。
