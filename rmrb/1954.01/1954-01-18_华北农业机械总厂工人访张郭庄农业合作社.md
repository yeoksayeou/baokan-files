Workers from the North China Agricultural Machinery Plant visited the semi-mechanized Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the outskirts of Beijing on the 12th. More than 70 people participated in this visit, including model workers, workers, and technical personnel.

Since its establishment in February last year, the Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative has used tractors donated by Czechoslovakian peasant brothers and signed a contract with the Beijing suburban tractor station for land cultivation. As a result, it achieved a widespread bumper harvest last year. The yield of corn per mu increased by 41 percent compared to individual farmers, and the yield of peanuts also increased by more than 39 percent. Most cooperative members received more than twice as much grain after the autumn harvest last year as they did the year before, and the lives of the members have generally improved. These facts have made many mutual aid teams and individual farmers see the development prospects of agricultural production cooperatives and the superiority of using machinery for farming, and they have requested to join the cooperative. On December 12th last year, the members of the Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative wrote a letter to the workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery Plant, reporting their production situation and inviting them to visit the countryside.

On the morning of the day the workers came to visit, more than 40 members of the Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative voluntarily gathered to welcome the worker elder brothers. The farmers also specially steamed a large pot of sweet potatoes to treat the guests. At the welcoming meeting, Guo Rong, the director of the Agricultural Production Cooperative, said: The fact that we have achieved a bumper harvest shows that farmers can only organize themselves and rely on the leadership of the working class and the supply of machinery to regularly obtain bumper harvests and improve their lives. In order to thank the worker elder brothers for their help, and to thank the Czechoslovakian peasant brothers for the agricultural machinery they gave us, our practical action is to actively sell surplus grain to the state and subscribe to public bonds to accelerate national industrialization. Recently, the entire cooperative collectively sold more than 35,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, and many people used these grain funds to actively subscribe to national economic construction bonds and deposit them in state banks.

During the discussion, the farmers felt the concern of the worker elder brothers for themselves. Cooperative member Miao Cheng kindly asked Jiao Xinglin, a model worker from the North China Agricultural Machinery Plant, and Shi Juncai, an advanced producer, who came to visit: We are now short of harvesting machines. Elder brothers, please help us think of a way so that we can be fully mechanized. Jiao Xinglin immediately said: "Our factory is producing a large number of harvesters, and we guarantee to send you high-quality and low-priced harvesters this autumn." Many workers also carefully solicited the farmers' opinions on improving new types of agricultural tools. When worker Qi Liyuan saw that the three-pronged weeder purchased by the cooperative had rusted, he enthusiastically taught the farmers how to maintain agricultural tools. This caring feeling moved all the farmers present.

The visiting workers also visited the cooperative's wheat fields, livestock pens, village schools, and supply and marketing cooperatives. Looking at the green wheat seedlings, the workers and farmers happily discussed the benefits of machine planting. Cooperative member Guo Qingrui said to the workers: When we started using machines for planting, some people were still skeptical. Now that such good wheat seedlings have grown, everyone is convinced. On this 40-mu winter wheat field alone, the millet that grew last year was more than one person tall, yielding 50 to 60 jin more per mu than the land of nearby individual farmers. When the workers went to visit the house where the cooperative stored agricultural machinery, the brand-new tractors, water pumps, horse-drawn agricultural implements, and 16 pieces of machinery and sanitary equipment given to the Zhangguozhuang farmers by Czechoslovakian farmers last April aroused their great interest. Township head Wang Liang introduced the deep friendship between the farmers in the township and the workers and farmers in Czechoslovakia. Wang Liang said that we will strengthen this brotherly friendship in the future.

The visiting workers also held a get-together with the farmers. After the visit, the workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery Plant presented the Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative with a silk banner with the words: "Workers and peasants unite and strive to realize national industrialization and agricultural collectivization under the guidance of the general line!" The cooperative members also gave the worker elder brothers two large bags of peanuts, which were the fruits of the cooperative's bumper harvest last year.

    华北农业机械总厂工人访张郭庄农业合作社
    华北农业机械总厂工人在十二日访问了京郊半机械化的张郭庄农业生产合作社。参加这次访问的有劳动模范、工人和技术人员等七十多人。
    张郭庄农业生产合作社从去年二月成立后，使用了捷克斯洛伐克农民弟兄赠送的拖拉机，并和京郊拖拉机站订了代耕合同，因此去年获得了普遍的丰收。每亩玉米产量比单干户农民提高百分之四十一，花生产量也提高了百分之三十九以上，大多数社员去年秋后分到的粮食比前年多一倍以上，社员生活也普遍得到改善。这些事实，使许多互助组和单干户的农民，看清了农业生产合作社的发展前途和使用机器耕种的优越性，纷纷要求入社。去年十二月十二日，张郭庄农业生产合作社社员写信给华北农业机械总厂工人，向他们报告了生产情况，并邀请他们下乡访问。
    在工人前来访问的这天清晨，张郭庄农业生产合作社四十多名社员自动集合起来，欢迎工人老大哥。农民们还特地蒸了一大锅白薯来招待客人。在欢迎会上，农业生产合作社主任郭荣说：我们获得丰收的事实，说明了农民只有组织起来，并依靠工人阶级的领导和供给机器，才能经常获得丰收，和改善自己的生活。为了感谢工人老大哥对我们的帮助，为了感谢捷克斯洛伐克农民弟兄送给我们的农业机器，我们的实际行动就是踊跃地把余粮卖给国家和认购公债，来加速国家工业化。最近全社集体卖给国家三万五千多斤余粮，不少人拿这些粮款踊跃认购国家经济建设公债和存入国家银行。
    在座谈中，农民们体会到工人老大哥对自己的关心。社员苗成亲切地向来访的华北农业机械总厂劳动模范焦兴林、先进生产者史俊才提出：我们现在就缺乏收割的机器，老大哥帮助我们想个办法，我们就全部机械化了。焦兴林立即说：“我们厂正大量生产收割机，保证在今秋送给你们物美价廉的收割机。”许多工人还细心地向农民征求了改进新式农具的意见。工人綦利元看到合作社买来的三齿耘锄已经生了锈，便热心地教给农民们保养农具的办法。这种关切的心情感动了在场的全体农民。
    来访的工人们还参观了合作社的麦地、牲口圈和村里的小学校、供销合作社。工人和农民眼看着绿油油的麦苗，愉快地谈论着机器播种的好处。社员郭卿瑞向工人们说：我们开始使用机器播种时，有些人还有怀疑。现在长出来这样好的麦苗，大家都信服了。就是这块四十亩的冬小麦地上，去年长的谷子有一人多高，比附近的单干农民的地每亩多收五六十斤。工人们到合作社收藏农业机器的房屋中去参观时，捷克斯洛伐克农民在去年四月送给张郭庄农民崭新的拖拉机、抽水机、马拉农具等十六件机器和卫生器材，引起他们极大的兴趣。乡长王亮介绍了该乡农民和捷克斯洛伐克的工人和农民的深厚友谊。王亮说，今后我们还要加强这种兄弟般的友谊。
    前来访问的工人还和农民举行了联欢会。参观以后，华北农业机械总厂工人赠给张郭庄农业生产合作社一面锦旗，旗上写着：“工人农民团结起来，在总路线照耀下为实现国家工业化、农业集体化而奋斗！”该社社员也送给工人老大哥两大口袋花生，这些花生是去年该社丰收的果实。
