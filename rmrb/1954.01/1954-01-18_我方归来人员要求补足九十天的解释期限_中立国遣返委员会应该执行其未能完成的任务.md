Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who returned after breaking through the control of special agents are resolutely demanding that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) and the Indian Custodial Force fulfill their unfinished task, continue the explanations, extend the ninety-day explanation period, and grant prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation the opportunity to hear explanations and apply for repatriation. They said: We know that those prisoners of war who were deprived of their right to hear explanations and apply for repatriation under the terrorist rule of special agents all want to return, and we must not allow the Americans to send them to the Kuomintang and the Syngman Rhee gang to serve as cannon fodder!

	Returning personnel Tian Gengsheng risked his life to climb the barbed wire fence to apply for repatriation when the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission investigated the Zhang Zilong murder case. At that time, he was almost killed by special agents. His own experience illustrates that the prisoners of war in Dongchang-ri have always been under the violent control of American special agents and cannot freely exercise their right to repatriation. He finally said: "The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should rescue our comrades, break up the terrorist organizations of special agents, and let them hear explanations and demand repatriation without threat!"

	Returning personnel Yue Heidan hesitated for three hours in the explanation tent because of the long-term terror rule of the American side. Finally, after repeated and patient explanations by our explanation representatives, he requested repatriation. He said: "Among our captured personnel in Dongchang-ri, there are too many people like me who have been made suspicious by the Americans and special agents. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force should continue to carry out their tasks so that prisoners of war have the opportunity to demand to return home without the threat and control of special agents!"

	Returning personnel Sun Guoxing, who escaped from the camp and requested repatriation during the roll call by the Indian Custodial Force on December 31 last year, said: After the explanation work was unreasonably terminated on December 24 last year, the prisoners of war in Dongchang-ri were extremely anxious, hoping to continue the explanations so that they could request to go home. Sun Guoxing emphasized: "There is no reason to deprive more than 85% of the prisoners of war of the right to hear explanations and apply for repatriation. This is inhuman!"

    我方归来人员要求补足九十天的解释期限
    中立国遣返委员会应该执行其未能完成的任务
    【新华社开城十六日电】突破特务控制遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员坚决要求中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队执行其未能完成的任务，继续进行解释和补足九十天解释期限，给予未曾行使遣返权利的战俘以听取解释和申请遣返的机会。他们说：我们知道这些在特务恐怖统治下被剥夺了听取解释和申请遣返权利的战俘都是希望回来的，决不能容许美国人把他们送给国民党和李承晚匪帮充当炮灰！
    归来人员田更生是在中立国遣返委员会调查谋杀张子龙案件时冒死爬铁丝网申请遣返的，当时，他几乎被特务分子杀害。他自己亲身的经历说明了东场里的战俘一直处在美方特务的暴力控制之下，不能自由行使遣返权利的情形，他最后说：“中立国遣返委员会应该把我们的这些伙伴们救出来，应该打破特务恐怖组织，让他们不受威胁地听取解释和要求遣返！”
    归来人员岳黑旦在听取解释时，因美方长期来的恐怖统治，在解释帐篷里犹疑了三个钟点，最后经过我方解释代表反复耐心的解释以后，才要求遣返归来。他说：“东场里的我方被俘人员中，像我这样被美国人和特务弄得心存疑惧的人太多了。中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队应该继续执行他们的任务，使战俘有不受特务的威胁和控制要求回家的机会！”
    在去年十二月三十一日印度看管部队点名时逃出营场要求遣返的归来人员孙国兴说：在去年十二月二十四日解释工作被无理终止以后，东场里的战俘万分焦急，盼望继续对他们进行解释，以便要求回家。孙国兴强调说：“没有任何理由剥夺百分之八十五以上的战俘听解释和申请遣返的权利，这是不人道的！”
