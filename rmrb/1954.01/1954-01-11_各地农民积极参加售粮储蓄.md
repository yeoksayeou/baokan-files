Farmers in various regions, after selling their surplus grain to the state, are actively depositing the money they do not immediately need into state banks, planning to invest it in agricultural production in a planned manner. The broad masses of farmers greatly support the "Preferential Grain Sales Fixed-Term Savings" method. They believe that if surplus money is not saved, it is most easily wasted; depositing surplus money in state banks can both support national construction and earn interest for themselves. After selling grain, Li Dianqi, a farmer in Yaokule Village, Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, kept 2.5 million yuan, planning to buy a horse in the spring. After bank cadres promoted the preferential grain sales savings method to him, he immediately deposited the 2.5 million yuan into the bank. He said, "If I deposit the money in the state bank now, and then take it out before the spring ploughing to buy a horse, it will not only be safe from being spent, but I can also earn more interest." In Yihe Village, Junping Township, Chongning County, Sichuan Province, farmers' savings accounted for 66 percent of the money from selling surplus grain, and the number of savings households accounted for 81 percent of the number of grain-selling households. In Sichuan Province, farmers' deposits in the first ten days of December last year increased by more than 40 billion yuan compared with the entire month of November. In Anhui Province, the cash deposited by farmers in banks in the first and middle ten days of December last year increased by more than double compared with November.

The local CCP committees and people's governments attach great importance to holding "Preferential Grain Sales Fixed-Term Savings," treating it as an important part of the current rural work. The CCP Anhui Provincial Committee, the Anhui Provincial People's Government, and the Yunnan Provincial Finance and Economics Committee have all issued instructions respectively on actively carrying out preferential grain sales savings in conjunction with grain purchase work, requiring relevant departments to closely cooperate and do a good job in this work. The CCP Anqing Prefectural Committee of Anhui Province sent people to help bank cadres conduct typical experiments on developing rural savings in Guichi, Dongliu, Hudong, and other counties. The leading organs of Xi'an City successively dispatched a large number of cadres to the suburbs to promote preferential grain sales savings work, and the relevant departments in the suburbs implemented joint offices to facilitate farmers' grain sales savings.

Since November of last year, local People's Banks have generally increased savings institutions and manpower in rural areas, and adopted many methods to facilitate farmers' savings. The People's Banks of Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to carry out savings as early as November last year. The Jilin Provincial Branch of the People's Bank organized five working groups in December last year to specifically help carry out rural savings work in twelve counties. The Yang County People's Bank in Shaanxi Province organized mobile working groups to go to the countryside to collect savings, and in the fourth district of the county, it absorbed 11.5 million yuan in farmers' deposits in one instance.

At present, the amount of rural savings in People's Banks across the country is constantly increasing. Compared with the end of October, the national rural savings amount at the end of December last year increased by 136.7 percent, the Southwest region increased by 454.5 percent, the Northeast region increased by 380.8 percent, Sichuan Province increased by more than six times, and Shanxi Province increased by nearly five times.

    各地农民积极参加售粮储蓄
    各地农民把余粮卖给国家以后，积极把暂时不用的钱存入国家银行，准备有计划地投入农业生产。广大农民对“优待售粮定期定额储蓄”的办法非常拥护。他们认为：余钱不储蓄起来，最容易浪费掉；把余钱存入国家银行，既能支持国家建设，自己又能得到利息。黑龙江省龙江县腰库勒村农民李殿起卖粮后，留了二百五十万元，准备春天买马。经过银行干部向他宣传了优待售粮储蓄办法，他立即把二百五十万元存入银行。他说：“现在把钱存入国家银行，等到春耕前买马时再取出来，不但保险不会零花掉，还可以多得利息。”四川省崇宁县君平乡义合村农民储蓄款占卖余粮款的百分之六十六，储蓄户数占卖粮户数的百分之八十一。四川省农民存款数字，去年十二月上旬比十一月全月增加了四百余亿元。安徽省去年十二月上、中两旬农民存入银行的现款，比十一月份增加一倍以上。
    各地中共党委和人民政府对举办“优待售粮定期定额储蓄”十分重视，都把它当作当前农村工作的一个重要部分。中共安徽省委会、安徽省人民政府和云南省财经委员会等都曾分别发出关于结合购粮工作积极开展优待售粮储蓄的指示，要求有关部门密切配合，作好这一工作。中共安徽省安庆地委派人帮助银行干部在贵池、东流、湖东等县进行了开展农村储蓄的典型试验。西安市领导机关先后抽调大批干部到郊区宣传了优待售粮储蓄工作，郊区有关部门并实行联合办公，以便利农民售粮储蓄。
    各地人民银行从去年十一月份起先后在各地农村普遍增加了储蓄机构和人力，并采用了许多办法便利农民储蓄。四川、云南等省的人民银行早在去年十一月间就派出大批干部下乡开展储蓄。人民银行吉林省分行在去年十二月间组织了五个工作组，分别到十二个县具体帮助开展农村储蓄工作。陕西省?阳县人民银行组织流动工作组下乡收储，在该县第四区一次就吸收了农民一千一百五十万元存款。
    目前，各地人民银行的农村储蓄额正在不断增加。去年十二月底的农村储蓄额和十月底比较，全国增加百分之一百三十六点七，西南区增加百分之四百五十四点五，东北区增加百分之三百八十点八，四川省增加六倍多，山西省增加近五倍。
