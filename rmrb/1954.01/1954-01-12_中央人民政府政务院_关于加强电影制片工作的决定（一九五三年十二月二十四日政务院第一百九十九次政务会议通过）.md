In the past four years, China's people's film industry has achieved significant development. The released feature films and documentaries have reflected the new life and struggle history of our people, and some films have reached a high level of ideological and artistic merit, which have been loved by the broad masses. Film has increasingly shown its importance in educating the people with patriotism and socialist spirit, and in meeting the cultural demands of the broad masses.

However, the quantity and quality of current film production cannot meet the needs of the broad masses. The main reason for this situation is a serious lack of film scripts. On the one hand, this is due to the shortage of full-time film scriptwriters and their insufficient proficiency. More importantly, it is due to the lack of clear production guidelines and practical production plans, and the failure to take all effective measures to attract a large number of literary writers to actively participate in film script creation, and to organize and guide creation in a correct way. In order to improve future film production work, the following decisions are made:

I. Guiding Principles and Tasks of Film Production

In view of the extremely broad mass nature of film art and its significant role in the education and cultural entertainment of the masses, it is necessary to adapt to the needs of the broad masses in the future, gradually improve the ideological and artistic level of films, and strive to increase the quantity of film production. In film art creation, on the one hand, we must oppose the phenomenon of shoddy work, and on the other hand, we must not have unrealistic and inappropriate excessive demands. The subject matter and content of films and their forms of expression should be as diverse as possible, and appropriate attention should be paid to all types of films. First of all, the production of feature films should be strengthened to truthfully portray all aspects of the past and present life and struggle of our people, especially to portray the new life of the people and create brilliant images of new advanced figures. In addition to feature films, documentaries and science education films should be produced more systematically; rural feature films that are popular and easy to understand should be produced to meet the needs of farmers, in order to ensure a sufficient number of rural screening programs; and children's films suitable for the needs of the broad masses of children and teenagers should be produced. Newsreels should report more timely and truthfully on the achievements of our people in the cause of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of the country and in the cause of safeguarding world peace, and should systematically shoot the beautiful rivers and mountains, scenic spots, historical sites, important products and cultural relics of the motherland. Science education films should explain natural and social phenomena from a materialist worldview, and at the same time publicize and promote various scientific and technical knowledge related to the daily life and production of the masses and suitable for the general public. Translated films from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries should account for a suitable proportion of the entire film production, and the quality of translation work should be further improved, with the addition of necessary subtitles and explanations to make it easier for the general audience to understand.

In the next four years, the annual film production tasks are roughly stipulated as follows:

	Twelve to fifteen large feature films and a certain number of rural feature films, children's films, animated films and stage art documentaries.

	Ten large documentaries and more than twenty short documentaries. Newsreels are released once a week.

	More than fifteen science education films.

	The translation of films from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries and progressive films from capitalist countries should roughly maintain an equal proportion to domestic films (including feature films and documentaries).

II. Formulation of Film Theme Plans and Organization of Film Script Creation

Film theme plans must be formulated based on the needs of the broad audience and the actual situation of the scriptwriting force. In the selection of themes, the scope should be expanded, and attention should be paid to the diversity of genres and forms. In addition to organizing new creations, efforts should be made to adapt outstanding modern and classical literary and drama works that are popular with the people into film scripts. In view of the fact that some works expressing important themes require a longer period of creative preparation, it is necessary to formulate theme plans for two or three years, or even longer.

In the organization of film script creation, it is necessary to change the past simple administrative leadership methods. Active assistance should be given to film scriptwriters to improve their ideological and artistic level, master film art forms, and provide specific guidance and assistance in their creative process in a timely manner. The Chinese Writers Association must take all effective measures to organize national literary writers to actively participate in film script creation, and encourage young writers to learn how to write film scripts. The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government should establish regular and close contact with the Writers Association, and the Film Script Creation Institute of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government should become an effective institution for widely contacting and organizing national writers to carry out film script creation. Thoughtful film criticism should be published frequently in newspapers and periodicals; excellent film literary scripts should be selected and published in literary magazines.

In formulating film theme plans and organizing script creation, full assistance and guidance must be obtained from relevant departments of the Central People's Government, the Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, trade unions, the Communist Youth League and other people's organizations. All relevant parties must also attach importance to and be good at using films as a powerful propaganda tool for their work, and provide full assistance in the selection of themes, policy ideas, and human and material resources.

III. Film Script and Film Censorship System

In view of the past cumbersome procedures and unclear responsibilities in the censorship of film scripts and films, it is necessary to effectively establish a unified, centralized, and layer-by-layer responsible censorship system in the future. Feature film scripts, outlines for the shooting of large documentaries, and completed films should be carefully reviewed by the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government, and then reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government. After the feature film script is approved, the Film Bureau should carefully review the storyboard script to avoid major revisions after the film is made. Scripts or shooting outlines and completed films of other types are generally reviewed and approved by the Film Bureau, except in special circumstances. When reviewing the scripts and completed films of large feature films, large documentaries, and certain short films with special significance, close cooperation must be obtained from the main leaders of relevant departments, and basic consensus must be sought on the review opinions. The annual film script theme plan and scripts or shooting outlines with major political significance should be submitted to the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for review.

IV. Improve Film Production System and Improve Technical Quality

The Film Bureau and its affiliated film studios must strengthen the ideological and artistic leadership of film production work, and at the same time strengthen enterprise management, implement cost accounting, and overcome waste. It is necessary to ensure a certain quality of film production and save costs. Standard production time for various types of films must be stipulated, and the unreasonable phenomenon of rushing to produce films at the end of the year, regardless of the time of script delivery and the length of production time, in order to complete the annual plan, must be changed, and films should be produced in an orderly and monthly manner. The technical quality of films must be gradually improved, and new printing workshops must be established in various film studios to ensure that the printing of films reaches a certain standard. At the same time, conditions should be prepared to strive to build new film studios in three to five years in order to be able to produce color feature films in a planned way.

V. Improve, Train and Replenish Film Cadres

In order to ensure the film production plan and improve the quality of films, it is a key issue to improve and train existing film art cadres and appropriately supplement some necessary cadres. To this end, the following measures must be taken:

	(1) The Chinese Writers Association should assist the Film Bureau in formulating a longer-term theme plan, organize writers to create film scripts, and attract young literary and art workers to learn film script creation through literary training courses or other means. Writers associations in major regions and literary federations in major provinces and cities should also mobilize and organize existing literary writers to actively participate in film script creation. The Film Bureau should also systematically train a group of young scriptwriters who are more familiar with film art forms. In addition, the editing staff of newsreels and science education films should be appropriately supplemented and trained.

	(2) The Film Bureau should organize existing film art cadres to conduct regular political and professional studies in artistic practice, and combine with creative needs to experience the life of the masses, so that their learning, life practice and creative practice are appropriately combined. Existing film specialists must be valued, and they must be helped to acquire new artistic viewpoints and methods in actual creative activities. At the same time, their cultivation and experience must be used to help and train new film art talents.

	(3) The Film Bureau should take appropriate methods to absorb young drama cadres to train assistant directors and director assistants in the way of apprenticeships, in order to prepare for the large number of director talents urgently needed for various types of films in the future. According to actual needs, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army should appropriately absorb military art cadres to serve as assistant directors and director assistants for military films, in order to gradually train a group of director talents who are competent for military feature films.

	(4) Film studios should selectively and emphatically absorb outstanding drama actors from various places to participate in film production; theaters and troupes should vigorously assist in supplying the actors necessary for film production.

	(5) The Film Bureau should strengthen the work of the film actor troupe, so that film actors can receive planned learning and stage performance training during the gaps in film production to improve their performance art; in addition, the Film Bureau should actively prepare conditions to strive to establish a film art academy in four or five years, in order to specialize in training film art talents, first of all scriptwriters, directors and actors.

	(6) In order to strengthen the political leadership and production management of the film production team and enable the director to concentrate on creative work, the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government should consult with relevant parties to transfer some politically strong cadres to participate in film production and gradually establish a production director system.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于加强电影制片工作的决定
    （一九五三年十二月二十四日政务院第一百九十九次政务会议通过）
      四年来，中国人民电影事业获得了重大的发展。已出的故事片和纪录片，反映了我国人民的新的生活和斗争历史，有些影片并已达到较高的思想艺术水平，受到了广大群众的喜爱。电影在以爱国主义和社会主义精神教育人民的事业上，在满足广大群众的文化要求上，已日益显出它的重要性。
    但是，目前电影出品的数量和质量都还不能满足广大群众的需要。造成这种情况的主要原因，是电影剧本严重缺乏，这一方面固然是由于专职的电影编剧不足及其业务不够熟练所致，但更重要的是由于缺乏明确的制片方针和切合实际的制片计划，及未能采取一切有效措施来吸引大量文艺作家积极参加电影剧本创作，并以正确方法组织和指导创作。为改进今后电影制片工作，特作如下决定：
    一、制片的方针与任务
    鉴于电影艺术具有极为广泛的群众性，具有对于群众的教育和文化娱乐的重大作用，今后必须适应广大群众的需要，逐步提高影片的思想和艺术水平，同时努力增加电影出品的数量。在电影艺术创作上，一方面要反对粗制滥造现象，另一方面又不可有脱离实际的、不适当的过高要求。影片的题材内容和表现形式应力求多样，对电影的各个片种均应加以适当的重视。首先，应加强故事片的制作，真实地表现我国人民过去和现在的各方面的生活和斗争，特别表现人民的新生活，创造新的先进人物的光辉形象。除故事片外，应更有计划地制作纪录片、科学教育片；制作适应农民需要的通俗易懂的农村故事片，以保证足够数量的农村放映节目；制作适合广大少年儿童需要的儿童片。新闻纪录片应更及时地、真实地报道我国人民在国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业中的成就和保卫世界和平事业中的贡献，并有计划地拍摄祖国的美丽河山、名胜、古迹，重要物产和文物。科学教育片应以唯物主义的世界观解释自然现象和社会现象，同时宣传和推广与群众日常生活和生产有关的，并适合一般群众水平的各种科学和技术知识。苏联和人民民主国家的翻译片，在整个影片生产中应占有合适的比例，并进一步提高译制工作的质量，增添必要的字幕解说，以便广大观众易于了解。
    今后四年内，每年制片的任务大体规定如下：
    大型故事片十二部至十五部及一定数量的农村故事片、儿童片、美术片和舞台艺术纪录片。
    大型纪录片十部及短纪录片二十部以上。新闻短片每周出一次。
    科学教育片十五部以上。
    翻译苏联和人民民主国家的影片及资本主义国家的进步影片，大体保持和国产影片（包括故事片和纪录片）相等的比例。
    二、电影题材计划的制定及电影剧本创作的组织工作
    电影题材计划，必须根据广大观众的需要与编剧力量的实际情况来制定。在题材选择上，应扩大范围，同时注意体裁和形式的多样性。除组织新的创作外，应尽量利用为人民所喜爱的我国现代和古典的优秀文学戏剧作品改编为电影剧本。鉴于有些表现重要主题的作品需要较长期的创作准备工作，因此必须制定两三年、甚至更长时间的题材计划。
    在电影剧本创作的组织工作上，必须改变过去那种简单的行政领导方法。应从积极方面帮助电影编剧作家提高思想和艺术水平，掌握电影艺术形式，并在其创作过程中及时地予以具体指导和帮助。中国作家协会必须采取一切有效措施组织全国文艺作家积极参加电影剧本创作，并鼓励青年作家学习编写电影剧本。中央文化部电影局应与作家协会建立经常的紧密的联系，中央文化部电影局的电影剧本创作所应成为广泛联系和组织全国作家进行电影剧本创作的有效机构。报纸刊物上应经常发表有思想性的电影批评；文艺杂志上应选登优秀的电影文学剧本。
    在拟定电影题材计划和组织剧本创作上，必须取得中央人民政府有关部门，人民解放军政治部、工会、青年团及其他人民团体的充分协助和指导，各有关方面亦必须重视与善于运用电影作为本部门工作的有力的宣传工具，并在选择题材上、政策思想上以及人力物力上予以充分的帮助。
    三、电影剧本、影片的审查制度
      鉴于过去在电影剧本、影片的审查工作上手续繁复，责任不明，今后必须切实建立统一集中、层层负责的审查制度。故事片剧本、大型纪录片拍摄提纲和完成片等均应由中央文化部电影局认真地完成初审，然后由中央文化部审查批准。故事片剧本批准后，电影局应认真审查分镜头剧本，尽量避免影片摄成后作重大修改。其他片种的剧本或拍摄提纲和完成片，除特殊情形外，一般由电影局审查批准。在进行对大型故事片、大型纪录片及某些有特殊意义的短片的剧本和完成片的审查时，必须取得有关部门的主要领导者的密切合作，并在审查意见上求得基本上的一致。全年电影剧本题材计划及有重大政治性的剧本或拍摄提纲，应送请中共中央宣传部审查。
    四、改进影片生产制度和提高技术质量
    电影局及所属各制片厂必须加强对影片摄制工作的思想和艺术领导，同时加强企业管理，实行成本核算，克服浪费现象，要做到既保证电影出品的一定质量又节省成本。必须规定各类影片的标准摄制时间，改变过去为了完成年度计划，不顾剧本下厂时间先后，摄制时间长短，一律赶年底出片的不合理现象，逐渐做到有顺序地、按月地出产影片。必须逐步提高影片的技术质量，在各制片厂建立新的洗印工作间，使影片的洗印达到一定标准。同时准备条件，争取在三、五年内修建新的制片厂以便能有计划地生产彩色故事片。
    五、提高、培养和补充电影干部
    为了保证影片生产计划、提高影片质量，提高与培养现有电影艺术干部并适当补充一些必需的干部，是带关键性的问题。为此必须采取以下措施：
    （一）中国作家协会应协助电影局制定较长时期的题材计划，组织作家创作电影剧本，并通过文学讲习所或采取其他方式吸引青年文艺工作者学习电影剧本创作。各大区作家协会及各主要省市文联也应该动员和组织现有文艺作家积极参加电影剧本创作的工作。电影局并应有计划地培养一批较为熟悉电影艺术形式的青年编剧。此外，并应适当补充和培养新闻纪录片和科学教育片编辑人员。
    （二）电影局应组织现有电影艺术干部在艺术实践中进行经常的政治和业务学习，并结合创作需要去体验群众生活，使他们的学习、生活实践和创作实践适当地结合起来。必须重视现有电影专门人才，并在实际创作活动中帮助他们取得新的艺术观点和方法，同时借助于他们的修养和经验，来帮助和培养新的电影艺术人才。
    （三）电影局应采取适当方法吸收青年戏剧干部以带徒弟方式培养副导演与导演助理，以准备将来各个片种所急需的大量的导演人才。根据实际需要，通过人民解放军总政治部适当吸收部队艺术干部担任军事片的副导演与导演助理的工作，以逐渐培养一批胜任军事故事片的导演人才。
    （四）电影制片厂应有选择、有重点地吸收各地优秀戏剧演员参加影片摄制工作；各剧院、剧团，应大力协助供给电影制片所必需的演员。
      （五）电影局应加强电影演员剧团的工作，使电影演员在电影生产间隙期间得到有计划的学习及舞台演出的锻炼，提高表演艺术；此外，电影局并应积极准备条件争取四、五年内创办电影艺术学院，以专责培养电影艺术人才，首先是编剧、导演与演员。
    （六）为了加强影片摄制组的政治领导与生产管理，使导演专心致力于创作工作，中央文化部应商同有关方面抽调一些政治上较强的干部参加制片工作，逐渐建立制片主任制度。
