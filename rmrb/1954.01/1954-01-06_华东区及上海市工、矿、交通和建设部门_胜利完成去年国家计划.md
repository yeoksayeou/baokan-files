    East China Region and Shanghai's Industrial, Mining, Transportation, and Construction Sectors
    Successfully Completed Last Year's National Plan
     [Report from this newspaper] At the end of 1953, the state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private industrial, mining, transportation, and basic construction sectors in East China Region and Shanghai Municipality victoriously completed the annual national plan.
    According to the actual figures for the completion of the national plan from January to November 1953 and the estimated figures for December, East China Region anticipates the following in the industrial sector: the output value can fulfill 107.63 percent of the national plan; the profit submitted can exceed the plan by 20 percent; the output of 23 major products, except paper, can all exceed the plan. In terms of transportation: the output value can fulfill 117.21 percent of the national plan; the profit submitted can fulfill 158.83 percent. The workload of the basic construction sector is expected to exceed that of 1952 by 177 percent in the state-owned system and 29.1 percent in the locally state-owned system.
    According to preliminary statistics from 136 factories in the heavy industry, textile industry, light industry, and electric power industry systems in Shanghai, these factories not only completed the annual profit submission plan but also over-fulfilled it by approximately 870 billion yuan. In the heavy industry system, 41 factories completed the annual gross output value plan and the fourth quarter production increase and economization plan. The machinery, electrical machinery, iron and steel, and chemical industries increased production by an average of about 11 percent compared to the annual plan. In the textile industry system, all 19 state-owned cotton textile factories completed the annual cotton yarn and cotton cloth output plan eight or nine days ahead of schedule, and the production profits submitted to the state increased by more than one-third compared to 1952. The four state-owned printing and dyeing factories completed the annual production plan 16 days ahead of schedule and can also additionally produce enough colored cloth and printed cloth for more than 2.9 million people to make a set of clothes each. In the light industry system, according to preliminary statistics from 73 factories, the annual gross output value plan was over-fulfilled by an average of 19.46 percent, and the profit submission plan was over-fulfilled by 62 percent. In terms of cost, the main industries averaged 8 percent lower than the original state targets. The main enterprise in the electric power industry – Shanghai Electric Power Company – over-fulfilled the annual plan for total output value by 8.12 percent, and over-fulfilled the profit submission plan by 30.24 percent. In terms of reducing costs, the coal consumption rate, plant power consumption rate, and line loss rate were reduced by 2.8, 6.6, and 1.5 percent respectively compared to the state's targets. In addition, the construction plan of Shanghai Construction Engineering Company also exceeded 1.4 percent by December 31, 1953.
    The workers of East China Region and Shanghai worked hard to complete the national plan, accumulating huge construction funds for the country. The profits submitted by the industrial and transportation sectors alone can build nine 100,000-kilowatt hydroelectric power stations or more than twenty 50,000-spindle modern textile factories. This amount of money can be used to purchase 19,428 large Stalin 80 tractors. Calculated at 2,000 catties of rice harvested by a farmer each year, this amount of money is equivalent to the annual harvest of more than 2.5 million farmers.
    The workers of East China Region and Shanghai demonstrated a high degree of creativity and initiative in production, manufacturing a large number of new products unprecedented in our country. Shanghai Boiler Factory manufactured a 100-ton giant electric traveling crane, providing extremely important lifting tools for China's large steel plants, coking plants, heavy machinery plants, and train factories. Shanghai Wire Factory successfully trial-produced 44 new products in one year, all of which are important materials for industrial construction, including wires and cables for transmitting electricity and oil mining cables for surveying underground oil source components and quality. In addition, the tungsten filaments and other tungsten alloy products manufactured by Shanghai Bulb Factory, the light rails for transportation in forest areas manufactured by Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's Third Factory, the "explosion-proof" motors manufactured by Shanghai Electric Motor Factory for use in mines, oil fields, and ships, and the control switches for large-scale automated machinery manufactured by Huatong Switch Factory also made great contributions to China's economic construction.
    The workers of East China Region and Shanghai completed the tasks entrusted by the state, powerfully supporting economic construction throughout the country. For example, the Shanghai Wire Factory supplied more than 3,000 types of wires to construction departments throughout the country in one year, with a total length of 140,000 kilometers, powerfully supporting 800 construction units such as the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and the Fuxin Open-pit Coal Mine. The textile machines produced by Shanghai Textile Machinery Factory in one year are enough to equip four Zhengzhou First Cotton Textile Factories. The new product gantry planers from Jinan Second Machine Tool Plant, the gantry drilling machine controllers, Soviet-style switches, and the twelve steam pumps manufactured by Xinzhong Power Machine Plant from Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory were all transported to Anshan in time and put into production. In addition, a large number of valuable machine tools and power machines, such as boring machines, universal grinding machines, diesel engines, diesel pile drivers, generators, transformers, boilers, and pumps, were transported and sold to all parts of the country through commercial departments.
    Now, many industrial, mining, and transportation departments in East China Region and Shanghai are formulating higher output and quality targets for 1954 based on the national requirements, on the basis of completing the tasks of the first year of the country's first five-year plan. The workers are brewing and discussing this year's plan and have expressed that they will continue to work hard to accelerate the country's socialist industrialization!

    华东区及上海市工、矿、交通和建设部门
    胜利完成去年国家计划
     【本报讯】华东区及上海市国营、地方国营和公私合营工、矿、交通运输、基本建设部门，在一九五三年年底，胜利地完成了全年国家计划。
    华东区根据各部门完成一九五三年一至十一月份的国家计划的实际数和十二月份的估计数，预计在工业方面：产值可完成国家计划百分之一百零七点六三；上缴利润可超额完成百分之二十；二十三种主要产品的产量，除纸张外，都可超额完成计划。交通运输方面：产值可完成国家计划百分之一百一十七点二一；上缴利润可完成百分之一百五十八点八三。基本建设部门的工作量，预计国营系统可比一九五二年超过百分之一百七十七，地方国营系统可超过百分之二十九点一。
    上海市根据重工业、纺织工业、轻工业及电力工业等产业系统中的一百三十六个工厂的初步统计，这些工厂除完成了全年的上缴利润计划之外，又超额上缴利润约八千七百多亿元。在重工业系统中，有四十一个厂完成了全年生产总值计划和第四季度增产节约计划。机械、电机、钢铁、化工等四个行业平均比全年计划增产百分之十一左右。纺织工业系统中，十九个国营棉纺织厂全部提前八天或九天完成了全年的棉纱和棉布产量计划，上缴给国家的生产利润比一九五二年增加三分之一以上。四个国营印染厂提前十六天完成了全年的生产计划，还可以额外增产足供二百九十多万人每人做一套衣服的色布和花布。轻工业系统中，据七十三个厂的初步统计，平均超额百分之十九点四六完成全年生产总值计划，上缴利润计划超过了百分之六十二。在成本方面，主要行业平均比国家原订指标还降低百分之八。电力工业中的主要企业——上海电力公司，总产值超额百分之八点一二完成全年计划，上缴利润超额百分之三十点二四。在降低成本方面，煤耗率、厂用电率和线路损耗率较国家的指标分别降低了百分之二点八、六点六和一点五。此外，上海市建筑工程公司的建筑计划，到一九五三年十二月三十一日，也超过了百分之一点四。
    华东区及上海市职工努力完成国家计划，为国家积累了巨额建设资金。仅工业和交通部门上缴的利润，就可以建造十万瓩的水力发电站九个或五万锭子的现代化纺织厂二十多个。这笔钱如用来购买大型的斯大林八十号拖拉机，可以购买一万九千四百二十八台。如按一个农民每年收获二千斤米计算，这笔钱等于二百五十多万农民一年的收获量。
    华东区及上海市的职工在生产中发挥了高度的创造性和积极性，制造了大批我国前所未有的新产品。上海锅炉厂制成一百吨巨型电动行车，为我国大型钢铁厂、炼焦厂、重型机器厂、火车厂提供了极其重要的起重工具。上海电线厂在一年内试制成功四十四种新产品，都是工业建设上重要的器材，其中有输送电力用的电线电缆、有可勘察地下的油源成分和质量用的油矿电缆。此外，上海灯泡厂制造的钨丝和其他钨合金产品、上海钢铁公司第三厂制造的森林地区运输用的轻便铁轨、上海电机厂制造的使用在矿井、油矿和船上的“防爆式”马达、华通开关厂制造的供大型自动化机械用的控制开关等新产品，对我国的经济建设，也有极大的贡献。
    华东区及上海市职工完成国家所交托的任务，有力地支援了全国各地经济建设。如上海电线厂，在一年中供应全国建设部门的电线，种数就达三千种以上，长度达十四万公里，有力地支援了鞍钢三大工程、第一汽车制造厂、阜新露天煤矿等八百个建设单位。上海纺织机械厂一年生产的纺织机，足可装备四个郑州第一棉纺织厂。济南第二机床厂的新产品龙门刨床、上海华通开关厂的龙门钻床控制器、苏式开关和新中动力机厂制造的十二台蒸气泵，都及时运往鞍钢，投入生产。其他，还有大量贵重的工作母机、动力机，如镗床、万能磨床、柴油机、柴油打桩机、发电机、变压器、锅炉、抽水机等通过商业部门运销全国各地。
    现在，华东区及上海市许多工、矿、交通运输部门在完成国家第一个五年计划第一年任务的基础上，根据国家要求拟订了一九五四年度更高的产量和质量指标。职工们正在酝酿讨论今年的计划，并表示要再接再厉为加速国家社会主义工业化而奋斗！
