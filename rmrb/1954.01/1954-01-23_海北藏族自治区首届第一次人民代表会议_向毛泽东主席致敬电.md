    Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Region First People's Representative Conference
    Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong

    Respected Chairman Mao:
    In the four years since liberation, under the brilliant illumination of the Chinese Communist Party's great national policy, the people of all ethnic groups in Haibei have united as never before. Preliminary progress has been made in political, economic, and cultural construction. Today, representatives of our Tibetan, Mongolian, Han, Hui, Tu, and Salar ethnic groups gather together to discuss national regional autonomy and establish the People's Government of the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Region. It is a great and joyous event that our minority nationalities, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have their own "home," something they have dreamed of for thousands of years.

    At the conference, we summarized the work of the past four years and discussed and determined the work tasks for the Haibei region in 1954. In the future, we will continue to strengthen the unity between and within all ethnic groups, vigorously cultivate cadres from our own ethnic groups, give full play to the initiative of "being masters of our own house," develop animal husbandry and agricultural production, gradually improve the material and cultural lives of all ethnic groups, and strive to implement the conference's resolutions, build a prosperous Haibei, and create conditions for a gradual transition to socialism.

    On this day of the conference's victorious conclusion, as all the people rejoice, we, on behalf of the 70,000 people of all ethnic groups in Haibei, extend our highest respect to you. And we wish you
    A long life without bounds.

    The First People's Representative Conference of the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province
    December 31, 1953

    海北藏族自治区首届第一次人民代表会议
    向毛泽东主席致敬电敬爱的毛主席：
    解放四年来，在中国共产党伟大的民族政策光辉照耀下，我们海北各族人民已经空前的团结起来了。政治、经济、文化等建设事业获得初步发展。今天，我们藏、蒙、汉、回、土、撒拉等各民族代表欢聚一堂，商讨民族区域自治，成立了海北藏族自治区人民政府。我们少数民族在共产党领导下有了自己的“家”，这是千百年来所梦想不到的大喜事。
    我们在大会上，总结了四年来的工作，讨论并确定了海北地区一九五四年的工作任务。今后我们一定继续加强各民族之间和民族内部的团结，大力培养本民族干部，发挥“当家作主”的积极性，发展畜牧业和农业生产，逐步改善各族人民物质和文化生活，为贯彻大会决议，建设繁荣的海北而努力，为逐步过渡到社会主义创造条件。
    在大会胜利闭幕、万民欢腾的今天，我们谨代表海北七万各族人民向您致以崇高的敬意。并祝您
    万寿无疆。
    青海省海北藏族自治区首届第一次人民代表会议
    一九五三年十二月三十一日
