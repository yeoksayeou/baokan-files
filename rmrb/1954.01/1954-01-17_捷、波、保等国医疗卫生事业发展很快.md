Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Bulgaria have been continuously developing medical and health services for the working people in the process of realizing socialist industrialization.

The government of the Czechoslovak Republic allocates large amounts of funds every year for the medical treatment and recuperation of the working people. In the past three years, the funds allocated to health services have increased by 3.7 times, reaching 4.2 billion crowns (Czechoslovak currency) in 1953 alone. Currently, Czechoslovakia has nearly 400 state and district hospitals, 1,600 district medical stations, and more than 3,100 pediatric and gynecological medical advisory centers. Hospitals in various regions are equipped with modern medical equipment. The number of beds in specialized and affiliated hospitals has increased by one-third. During the Five-Year Plan (1949-1953), the number of doctors increased by 6,000. At present, Czechoslovakia has an average of one doctor for every 771 residents, compared to one doctor for every 1,208 residents in 1937.

Poland's medical services are also developing rapidly. In the first four years of the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955), the number of hospital beds in Poland increased by 43 percent compared to 1949, and by more than 77 percent compared to the pre-war period. By the end of 1953, the number of physicians with higher education in Poland had increased by 63 percent compared to 1949. Currently, Poland has 55 doctors for every 100,000 residents, compared to only 37 doctors in the pre-war year of 1938. The Polish government also attaches great importance to the development of higher and secondary medical education. At present, there are ten higher medical schools in the country, with five times the number of students as before the war, and more than twice the number of departments and lectureships. In the past four years, the number of scientific staff in higher medical schools has also increased by about six times. At the same time, the medical equipment industry has also developed. In 1953 alone, Poland's medical equipment industry produced more than 2,000 kinds of instruments and equipment. At present, its products can meet 86 percent of the country's needs.

The government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria also attaches great importance to the development of medical services. In the past few years, the funding for public health services has increased several times, and all people in the country can enjoy free medical treatment. By the end of 1952, the number of hospitals had doubled compared to 1948, clinics increased by 28 percent, maternity stations increased by nearly doubled, nurseries doubled, sanatoriums increased by one and a half times, and hospital beds almost doubled. Bulgaria has 178 sanatoriums in addition to health resorts. In 1953, more than 118,300 people took vacations in these sanatoriums. All sanatoriums are equipped with modern physiotherapy equipment.

    捷、波、保等国医疗卫生事业发展很快
    【新华社十六日讯】捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和保加利亚在实现社会主义工业化的过程中，不断地发展了劳动人民的医疗卫生事业。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府每年都拨出大笔经费，作为劳动人民医疗和休养之用。在过去三年中，拨给卫生事业的款项已增加为三点七倍，单是一九五三年就达四十二亿克朗（捷币名）。现在，捷克斯洛伐克已有将近四百个州立和区立医院，一千六百个区立医疗站，三千一百多个儿科和妇科医疗顾问所。各地医院都配备了现代化的医疗设备。各专科和附属医院的病床数目增加了三分之一。在五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）期间，医生人数增加了六千名。目前捷克斯洛伐克平均每七百七十一个居民中便有一个医生，在一九三七年，平均一千二百零八个居民只有一个医生。
    波兰的医疗事业也在迅速发展。在六年计划（一九五○—一九五五年）头四年中，波兰医院病床的数目比一九四九年增加了百分之四十三，比战前增加了百分之七十七以上。到一九五三年年底，波兰受过高等教育的医师比一九四九年增加了百分之六十三。目前，波兰每十万居民中有五十五个医生，而在战前一九三八年只有三十七个医生。波兰政府也很重视发展高等和中等医学教育。目前全国有十个高等医科学校，学生数目为战前的五倍，科系和讲座的数目增为两倍多。最近四年来，高等医科学校的科学工作人员也增加约为六倍。与此同时，医疗设备工业也有了发展。单是一九五三年波兰的医疗设备工业就出产了两千余种仪器和设备。目前，它的产品已能满足全国百分之八十六的需要。
    保加利亚人民共和国政府对医疗事业的发展也很重视。在过去几年中，公共卫生事业的经费增加了好几倍，全国人民都能享受免费的医疗。到一九五二年底，医院的数目就比一九四八年增加了一倍，诊疗所增加了百分之二十八，接生站增加了将近一倍，托儿所增加了两倍，休养所增加了一倍半，医院病床几乎增加了一倍。保加利亚除疗养院以外，有一百七十八个休养所。一九五三年在这些休养所休假的有十一万八千三百多人。所有的疗养院都设有现代化的理疗设备。
