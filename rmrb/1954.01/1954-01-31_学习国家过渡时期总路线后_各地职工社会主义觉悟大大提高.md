　　After Studying the General Line for the Transition Period, the Socialist Consciousness of Workers in Various Regions Has Greatly Increased
    Since studying the general line, workers in enterprises across the country have greatly enhanced their socialist consciousness and sense of responsibility as masters of the country. The workers unanimously believe that the general line is like a lighthouse, illuminating the socialist road more clearly. The broad masses of workers have a clear understanding of the significance of national industrialization, as well as the relationship between themselves and their enterprises and national industrialization, and their enthusiasm for production has become even higher. Liu Tonggao, a special-class labor model from Qingdao, said: "In the struggle to realize the country's socialist industrialization, our working class must be in the vanguard!" Lou Dianmin, a worker from the Longfeng Mine in Fushun, said: "If we produce more coal, we can refine more steel and manufacture more machines. This will allow us to transition to socialism more quickly!" Therefore, they have all made guarantees to overfulfill the national production plan. After studying the general line, workers in the First Mechanical Workshop of the Dalian Machine Tool Plant launched a wave of technical innovation, with fourteen Party members submitting guarantees to the branch to find clever solutions. Sun Zhenguan, a worker in the workshop, used to use pliers to clamp the positioning axle seat, clamping only one at a time. Now he has made two fixtures and can clamp nine pieces at a time. Twenty-five of the twenty-eight types of quotas newly revised by the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant have been broken. After listening to the report on the general line, the workers who are building the Hanshui Iron Bridge immediately discussed and formulated the group's work plan and launched a labor competition, striving for the early passage of trains on the Hanshui Iron Bridge.
    After studying, many workers have further raised their class consciousness and drawn a clear line between socialist and capitalist thinking. Kang Lu, the deputy captain of the Chaozhou Construction Engineering Team, had saved some money in the past and wanted to run a lime kiln and a machine saw factory himself to make money. After studying, he realized that this kind of thinking was dangerous and immediately dispelled the idea. Li Changsi, an old worker in his sixties from the Baoding Power Plant, had saved more than one million yuan before the study, intending to take it home to hoard grain. Now he knows that doing so "is not good for socialism" and has decided to deposit the money in the bank. Fu Zhenhua, a turner from the Tianjin Tram Company, used to think that his salary was low and he was not motivated to work. After studying, he said: "If all the wealth we produce is used to improve our lives, the country will not be able to accumulate funds for construction. Only when the country is well-built can individuals have a good life. So we must think about the whole country." Now he is motivated to work, and his production efficiency in turning free-rolling parts has increased by nearly one time.
    After studying and discussing, many workers in local state-owned enterprises and light industry have also clarified the relationship between their enterprises and national industrialization, as well as their personal responsibilities in implementing the national general line. Some workers in the Yuebei Tanling Mine used to think that their mine had little future and wanted to work in large state-owned enterprises. Now they realize that working in existing industrial and mining enterprises to cooperate with heavy industry construction has a great effect on the country's socialist industrialization. In the past, many workers in the Nanchang Xinsheng Textile Factory felt that their factory was a light industry and that the state would not be able to install many new machines in the recent years, so the work was uninteresting, and their production enthusiasm was not high. Since listening to the report on the general line and clarifying that light industry is responsible for supplying the people's living needs and accumulating funds for heavy industry, their production enthusiasm has significantly improved.
    Workers working in private enterprises, after studying, realized that they shoulder the important task of assisting the state in carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. In more than two hundred private factories in the Jianghan District of Wuhan City that undertake state orders, many workers in the past simply thought: "It is not glorious to work in private enterprises," and were not motivated to produce. Now the workers realize that they should shoulder the important responsibility of helping the state to carry out the socialist transformation of private enterprises, and production is becoming more and more vigorous. Representatives of workers from twelve private enterprises took the lead in formulating specific guarantees for completing the state's processing and ordering tasks, and challenged all the private enterprises in the district that undertake state processing and ordering. Some trade union cadres in private hardware factories in the Yulin District of Shanghai said: "In the past, although we knew that processing and ordering was important, we didn't know that processing and ordering was a form of state capitalism and a way to carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry. Now we understand." Huang Zuping, a worker at the Xiaogan Chengguan Town Rice Mill in Hubei, said: "In the future, we must work hard to complete the processing tasks assigned to us by the state, and we must guarantee quality and not allow the capitalists to adulterate the products." After studying, some handicraft workers also realized their future. Yu Heshang, a worker at the Xianning County Bamboo Products Processing Factory in Hubei, said in the discussion: "I used to think that handicrafts had no future. I thought I might as well go home and farm the land sooner, and in the future, I could use a tractor to farm the land under socialism, which has a future. After studying, I realized that handicrafts also have to take the road of cooperativization, which is necessary for people's lives and for building socialism."

### 学习国家过渡时期总路线后  各地职工社会主义觉悟大大提高

　　学习国家过渡时期总路线后
　　各地职工社会主义觉悟大大提高
    全国各地企业职工，自学习总路线后，社会主义觉悟和国家主人翁的责任感大大提高。职工们一致认为：总路线像灯塔一样，把社会主义的大道照得更清楚了。广大职工明确地认识了国家工业化的意义，以及自己和本企业与国家工业化的关系，生产积极性更加高涨。青岛市特等劳动模范刘同诰说：“在实现国家的社会主义工业化的斗争中，我们工人阶级要打头阵！”抚顺龙凤矿工人娄殿民说：“我们多产一些煤，就能多炼一些钢铁，就能多制造一些机器。这样就能快些过渡到社会主义！”因此他们都纷纷提出保证，要超额完成国家生产计划。大连机床厂第一机械车间工人学习总路线后掀起了改革技术的热潮，有十四个党员向支部提出找窍门的保证书。该车间工人孙振观，过去刨定位轴座，用钳子卡，一次只卡一个，现在他做出两个胎，一次能卡九个活了。北京第一机床厂新修订的二十八种定额，已有二十五种被突破。正在建设汉水铁桥的工人听了总路线报告，马上讨论和制订了小组的作业计划，并开展了劳动竞赛，为在汉水铁桥上早日通行火车而努力。
    许多职工经过学习，进一步提高了阶级觉悟，划清了社会主义与资本主义的思想界限。潮州市建筑工程队副大队长康辂，过去积蓄了些钱，想自己经营一个灰窑，开一个机锯厂来赚钱；经过学习，他认识到这种思想是危险的，立刻打消了这个念头。保定发电厂六十多岁的老工人李长思，在学习前积蓄了一百来万元准备捎回家囤粮，现在知道这样作“对社会主义没好处”，决定把钱存到银行去。天津电车公司旋工傅振华以前总认为自己的工资低，干活不起劲。学习后，他说：“我们生产出来的财富，要是都用来改善生活了，国家就不能积累资金进行建设了。国家建设好了，个人的生活才能好。所以要为整个国家着想才对。”现在他干活有劲头了，旋自由滚活件，生产效率提高了将近一倍。
    经过学习讨论，许多地方国营企业、轻工业工人也都明确了本企业和国家工业化的关系，以及个人在贯彻国家总路线中的责任。粤北潭岭矿场一些职工，过去认为他们的矿场前途不大，想到国营大企业去做工，现在认识到在原有工矿中工作，配合重工业建设，对国家社会主义工业化作用很大。南昌新甡纺织厂过去有许多工人觉得本厂是轻工业，国家在最近几年不能给多装新机器，工作没味道，因此生产情绪不高。自听了总路线的报告，明确了轻工业担负着供应人民生活需要和为重工业积累资金的责任，生产情绪显著提高。
    在私营企业中工作的职工，经过学习认识到自己担负着协助国家对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的重大任务。武汉市江汉区二百多家承受国家订货的私营工厂中，过去有不少工人单纯地认为：“在私营企业中工作不光荣”，生产不起劲。现在工人认识到自己应担负起帮助国家对私营企业进行社会主义改造的重大责任，生产愈来愈起劲，有十二家私营企业的工人代表带头制订了完成国家加工订货任务的具体保证，并向全区承接国家加工订货的私营企业提出挑战。上海榆林区有些私营五金工厂的工会干部说：“从前虽然晓得加工订货重要，但不知道加工订货就是国家资本主义的一种形式，就是对资本主义工业进行社会主义改造的一条路子，现在可明白了。”湖北孝感城关镇米厂工人黄祖平说：“今后我们要努力完成国家交给我们的加工任务，并且要保证质量，不许资方掺杂掺假。”一些手工业工人，经过学习，也认识到自己的前途。湖北咸宁县竹器加工厂工人余和尚在讨论中说：“我以前总认为手工业没前途。我想我还不如早点回家种点田，将来到社会主义还可用拖拉机耕田，有前途。经过学习，我才认识到手工业也要走合作化的道路，对人民生活和建设社会主义都是必要的。”
