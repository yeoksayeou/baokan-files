Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 6th. The People's Representatives Conference of the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province was held from December 25, 1953, to January 1, 1954, in a tent that could accommodate more than 800 people on the Jimai Grassland. A total of 177 representatives from various tribes and monasteries attended the meeting. The meeting exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, established the People's Government of the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, equivalent to a special district level, and elected Zha Xi Wang Xu (Tibetan) as chairman, Kang Wanqing (Tibetan), Kang Keming (Tibetan), Dan Zeng Jian Mucuo (Tibetan), Yi Xin Wangjie (Tibetan), Que Jun Guo (Tibetan), and Ka Na Ga Duo (Tibetan) as vice chairmen, and elected 25 government members.
    Ma Wanli, Secretary of the CPC Guoluo District Work Committee, addressed the meeting, emphasizing the significance of establishing the autonomous region. He said: The establishment of ethnic autonomous regions and autonomous organs is the realization of the right of the Guoluo people to "be masters of their own affairs" in managing the internal affairs of their own nation under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government. It will greatly promote the further development of the political, economic, and cultural undertakings in the Guoluo region. At the meeting, the representatives spoke enthusiastically. The representative of Baiyu Temple, the largest monastery in the Guoluo region, Living Buddha Guoqing Zige, said: We Tibetans cherish our close friendship with the Han people, and we must accept the help of the advanced Han people to enable the Guoluo region to get rid of its backward state and gradually catch up with the advanced regions. Representatives from the Gongma Cang and Moba tribes spoke about their impressions of visiting the interior in 1952 and expressed their confidence in building a new Guoluo. They said: Inner Mongolia has achieved such great success in seven or eight years, mainly due to the leadership of the Communist Party and the help of Han cadres, as well as the unity and efforts of the people of Inner Mongolia. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region today is the Guoluo region tomorrow.
    The chairman, vice chairmen, and government members of the People's Government of the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture unanimously stated when taking office that they would continue to strengthen national unity, stabilize social order, develop animal husbandry and agricultural production, and gradually change the backward situation in the Guoluo region and catch up with the advanced ethnic regions under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the higher-level People's Government.

    中共果洛区工作委员会书记马万里向大会致词，着重讲述了建立自治区的意义。他说：建立民族自治区和自治机关，是果洛人民在毛主席、共产党和人民政府领导下，实现了在管理本民族内部事务上“当家作主”的权利。它将大大推动果洛区的政治、经济、文化事业进一步发展。会上，代表们纷纷发言。果洛区最大寺院白玉寺代表国庆智格活佛说：我们藏族珍视与汉族的亲密友谊，要接受先进的汉族的帮助，使果洛区脱离落后的状态，逐渐赶上先进的地区。贡马仓、莫巴等部落的代表都在发言中谈到自己一九五二年参观内地时的感想，并表示对建设新果洛满怀信心。他们说：内蒙古在七八年间获得那样大的成就，主要是有了共产党的领导和汉族干部的帮助，同时由于内蒙人民的团结与努力获得的结果。内蒙古自治区的今天，就是果洛区的明天。
