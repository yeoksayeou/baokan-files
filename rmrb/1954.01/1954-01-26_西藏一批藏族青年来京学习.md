Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, January 25th: Recently, eighteen Tibetan youths from the Tibet region went to Beijing to participate in studies. This group of young people had previously undergone half a year of study in the Tibetan animal epidemic prevention personnel training class organized by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region. Before their departure, the Tibetan local government specially wrote a farewell letter and sent Tzipon Lobsang Wangchuk to represent the Tibetan local government to bid them farewell on January 12th. The Tibet Military Region prepared cold-weather clothing for them and assigned special personnel to teach basic courses such as Tibetan language, arithmetic, and political common sense. The youths were very grateful for the care of Chairman Mao and the Dalai Lama, and all expressed that they would work hard to learn more techniques in the capital of the motherland to open up new paths for the development of animal husbandry in their own ethnic group.

    西藏一批藏族青年来京学习
    【新华社拉萨二十五日电】西藏地区最近有十八名藏族青年前往北京参加学习。这批青年曾经在中国人民解放军西藏军区主办的藏族兽疫防治人员训练班，经过了半年的学习。在他们出发以前，西藏地方政府特地写了欢送信，并派孜仲罗桑旺扎代表西藏地方政府于一月十二日前来欢送。西藏军区给他们准备了御寒的衣物，并指派专人教授藏文、算术和政治常识等基本课程。青年们很感激毛主席和达赖喇嘛的关怀，都表示在祖国的首都要努力学得更多的技术，为发展本民族的畜牧业开辟新的道路。
