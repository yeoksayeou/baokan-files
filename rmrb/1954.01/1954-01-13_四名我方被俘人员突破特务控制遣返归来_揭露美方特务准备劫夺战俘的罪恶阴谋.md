Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 12th: Just as the U.S. side is frantically clamoring to use force to seize prisoners of war on January 23rd, three Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel and one Korean People's Army captured personnel, who risked their lives to break through special agent control and request repatriation, were repatriated today. This is the second group of prisoners of war who have risked their lives to escape special agent control and apply for repatriation after the U.S. side unreasonably terminated the explanation work.

After these four captured personnel from our side arrived in Panmunjom, they exposed to the neutral nations personnel present the sinister conspiracy of the Chiang-Lee special agents in the Dongchang-ri camp to seize prisoners of war with the support of U.S. forces. Chen Guanci, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who escaped from Camp No. 27, said: A few days before he escaped from the camp, the special agent "Deputy Battalion Commander" Zhou Yucheng convened a meeting of special agent elements above the "Deputy Squad Leader" level to convey a "directive" from "Teacher Ma," a Taiwan special agent mixed into the U.S. 64th Field Hospital. This "directive" ordered the special agent elements to prepare to seize the prisoners of war out of the prisoner of war camp on January 23rd. The general idea of the "directive" was: First, January 23rd is the designated "freedom day" for "releasing" prisoners of war. At that time, the U.S. military will force the Indian custodial forces to open the gates of each camp and let them out. As soon as the bell outside the camp rings, they must act immediately and force all the prisoners of war to form four columns and walk out of the camp. While they are escorting the prisoners of war south, U.S. troops will be along the way to "maintain order." Second, when seizing the prisoners of war out of the camp, all special agent elements and "security guards" must closely monitor all the prisoners of war. If any prisoner of war disobeys orders or attempts to escape to the Indians to apply for repatriation, they will be killed on the spot.

Chen Guanci said: This Taiwan special agent named Ma also ordered the special agents in each camp to immediately conduct an emergency investigation among the prisoners of war, and take strict measures against the prisoners of war who were found to be requesting repatriation, to prevent them from requesting repatriation from the Indians at that time. In Camp No. 27, special agent leader Zhou Yucheng had already separately detained more than 80 prisoners of war who showed signs of longing for their homeland and desire for repatriation, and they were not allowed to move around freely. Every day, special agent elements such as the "Battalion Commander" and the "Education Section Chief" took turns giving them "speeches," threatening them to go to Taiwan.

Chen Guanci said: Recently, the special agents have been forcing the prisoners of war to conduct team formation exercises and military drills every day to prepare for "escaping" from the camp. The special agents have also intensified the implementation of a reign of terror against the prisoners of war. They are not allowed to talk to each other. As soon as it gets dark, they force the prisoners of war to enter the tents and are not allowed to come out again. Chen Guanci himself was beaten by the special agents until his palm was swollen an inch high because he accidentally said a word unfavorable to the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan. Later, when he went to the hospital for treatment, he took the opportunity to escape the control of the special agents and applied for repatriation.

Zhang Shaohuai, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who escaped from Camp No. 1, said: Camp No. 1 is a prison, which imprisoned more than 20 prisoners of war who expressed their desire to return to their country. These prisoners of war longed to see the explanation representatives of their motherland so that they could apply for repatriation every day. Several of them have become insane after suffering cruel persecution by special agents because they missed their motherland. Two mentally disturbed prisoners of war ran to the barbed wire fence every day and shouted "I want to go home!" The special agents subjected them to吊打 (diàodǎ - suspension beatings) and forced them to crawl on the ground full of stones. On one occasion, the special agent elements also poured gasoline on them and then set them on fire, and their hair, eyebrows, chest, and chin were burned. Zhang Shaohuai asked the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to uphold justice and give the prisoners of war in Dongchang-ri who are suffering and hoping for repatriation the opportunity to hear explanations and apply for repatriation.

Gui Changjian, a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army who escaped from Camp No. 51, said: The Syngman Rhee special agents are spreading rumors to scare the prisoners of war so that they dare not escape the camp to apply for repatriation. These special agents deceive the prisoners of war by saying: "The U.S. military and the Indian army have reached an agreement. On January 23rd, the Indian army will help the U.S. military to 'release' the prisoners of war. Anyone who wants to find the Indians to apply for repatriation will only find death."

    四名我方被俘人员突破特务控制遣返归来
    揭露美方特务准备劫夺战俘的罪恶阴谋
    【新华社开城十二日电】正当美方疯狂叫嚣要在一月二十三日用武力劫夺战俘的时候，又有冒死突破特务控制要求遣返的三名中国人民志愿军被俘人员和一名朝鲜人民军被俘人员在今天被遣返归来。这是在美方无理终止解释工作以后第二批冒死逃出特务控制申请遣返的战俘。
    这四名我方被俘人员到达板门店后，就对在场的中立国人员揭露了东场里营场内的蒋李特务准备在美方武力接应之下劫夺战俘的罪恶阴谋。从第二十七号营场逃出来的志愿军被俘人员陈官次说：在他逃出营场前几天，特务“大队副”周玉成曾召集“小队副”以上的特务分子开会，传达混在美军第六十四野战医院里的台湾特务“马老师”的一件“指令”。这个“指令”命令特务分子作好准备，在一月二十三日把战俘劫出战俘营。“指令”的大意是：一、一月二十三日是规定“释放”战俘的“自由日”。到那个时候，美军就会迫使印度看管部队打开各个营场的大门，让他们出去。只要营场外面的钟声一响，他们就要立即行动，强迫所有战俘排成四路纵队走出营场。在他们押解战俘南下时，沿途还有美军部队“维持秩序”。二、在把战俘劫出营场时，全体特务分子和“警备队员”要严密监视所有的战俘。如有战俘不服从命令，或企图逃到印度人那里去申请遣返，就把他当场打死。
    陈官次说：这个姓马的台湾特务还命令各个营场的特务立即在战俘中间进行紧急调查，对被发现出来的要求遣返的战俘采取严格的措施，以防止他们到时向印度人要求遣返。在第二十七号营场里，特务头子周玉成已经把因为思念祖国渴望遣返而稍露愁容的八十多个战俘单独拘禁起来，不准他们随便行动。每天，“大队长”、“教育股长”等特务分子轮流对他们进行“讲话”，恫吓他们到台湾去。
    陈官次说：近来，特务们每天强迫战俘进行编队练习和军事操练，做好越营“逃跑”的准备。特务们还加紧对战俘施行恐怖统治。他们不许战俘互相交谈。天刚黑，他们就强迫战俘进入帐篷，不许再出来一步。陈官次自己也因为不小心说了一句对台湾残余蒋匪帮不利的话，他的手掌被特务们打得肿起寸把高。后来，他在到医院去医治时，就乘机逃脱特务控制申请遣返。
    从第一号营场逃出来的志愿军被俘人员张少怀说：第一号营场是一个监狱，这里面囚禁着二十多名流露出回国愿望的战俘。这些战俘每天都渴望着能够看到祖国的解释代表以便申请遣返。他们之中有好几个人因为思念祖国遭到特务的残酷迫害后变成了疯子。有两个神经失常的战俘天天跑到铁丝网跟前高喊“我要回国！”特务们就对他们施行吊打、并且罚他们在满是石子的地上爬。有一次，特务分子还把汽油浇在他们身上，然后点上火烧，他们的头发、眉毛、胸部和下巴都被烧坏了。张少怀要求中立国遣返委员会主持公道，给予东场里遭受着苦难的希望遣返的战俘以听取解释和申请遣返的机会。
    从五十一号营场逃出来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员桂昌渐说：李承晚特务正在制造谣言恫吓战俘，使他们不敢逃出营场申请遣返。这些特务欺骗战俘说：“美军和印度军队已经取得协议。在一月二十三日，印度军队将帮助美军‘释放’战俘。谁想找印度人申请遣返，只有死路一条。”
